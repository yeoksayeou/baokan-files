In the past, coal miners regarded the strongest person as the most capable, and gave them nicknames such as "Little Tiger," "Little Electric Drill," and "Hercules"; now, innovation experts have become the most popular people, and they also have nicknames: "All-rounder," "Expert Competitor," "Innovation Fan," etc. Currently, there are two types of books in short supply in Xinhua bookstores: one is Chairman Mao's works, and the other is popular science and technology readings. A climax of learning theory and culture has arrived with the climax of the technological revolution.

Fellow deputies:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget draft, and I guarantee to resolutely implement them in my work. The Fuxin area, like all parts of the country, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the direct leadership of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, has achieved continuous great leaps forward since 1958. Now, I will give a brief report to the conference on the development of coal production and coal transportation.

Ideological revolution, production revolution, and technological revolution are mutually causal; facts prove that one ideological liberation leads to the emergence of new things, and the emergence of new things greatly promotes production efficiency.

Fuxin is one of the important coal industrial bases in China. There are more than a thousand factories, mines, and users that use Fuxin coal as raw material and fuel. This arduous and glorious task requires us to produce more coal and transport it faster with the greatest effort to support the national great leap forward. In 1958, the output of raw coal by the Fuxin Mining Bureau was 13.6 million tons, an increase of 80% compared with 1957. This was a great leap forward. In 1959, the output of raw coal increased by 34% compared with 1958. This was another great leap forward. In the first quarter of this year, the Fuxin Mining Bureau completed the state coal production plan eleven and a half days ahead of schedule. The production level increased by 36% compared with the same period last year, and even increased by 11% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, which had the highest output. Compared with the national plan, overall efficiency increased by 14.6%. The cost of raw coal decreased by 8.5%. The quality and variety also met the national requirements. Tunneling and stripping also overfulfilled the state plan. At the same time, coal transportation work has also developed greatly. The average time spent at Fuxin Station in the first quarter was 5.4 hours, which was 1.1 hours shorter than the 6.5 hours target last year. The average time spent at Xiqiu Station was 4.2 hours, which was more than 3 hours shorter than last year. Other indicators were also completed very well. The victory of the "red opening" and "red everywhere" in the first quarter not only completely changed the old routine of coal industry being loose at the beginning and tight at the end for many years, but also symbolized that 1960 would be another great leap forward, and a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. Just as the workers said, "This year's comprehensive great leap forward is solid as iron." Based on this year's great leap forward situation, coupled with the huge potential of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, there will be a greater leap forward in coal production this year. After three consecutive years of great leaps forward, the output of Fuxin coal mines will triple compared to 1957. This vivid fact powerfully shattered the right-leaning opportunists' slander against the great leap forward.

The fundamental reason why Fuxin has been able to achieve continuous great leaps forward in industry and various tasks since 1958 is that the Fuxin Municipal Party Committee, under the correct leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, held high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and the "Three Banners," earnestly implemented the general line of building socialism formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, as well as a complete set of policies of walking on two legs, breaking superstitions, liberating the mind, putting politics in command, continuously revolutionizing, and vigorously carrying out mass movements.

More than two years of great leap forward practice has proved that Mao Zedong Thought is the truth for the great leap forward and high-speed development of socialist construction, a great driving force for mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people, and a lighthouse for continuous revolution and continuous great leap forward. Where the working people have mastered Mao Zedong Thought, there they are high-spirited, full of energy, with thousands of troops and horses, invincible, production is booming, and tasks are overfulfilled. Conversely, where Mao Zedong Thought is abandoned, there they are dispirited, frowning, fighting alone, at a loss, production is declining day by day, and tasks are not completed. There was such a lesson last year. In May and June of 1959, due to the rise of right-leaning opportunist thought, a gust of cold wind was blown under the guise of implementing the coal plan, and May and June, which were originally good production seasons, resulted in a low-yield situation. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the whole city greatly opposed right-leaning and greatly encouraged efforts, and production rose in a straight line. In July and August, there were more than thirty days of continuous rainfall, and all open-pit mines suffered severe floods. The Haizhou open-pit mine accumulated more than 900,000 cubic meters of water, submerged more than 1,700 meters of mine ditches, and almost the entire mine was shut down. However, inspired by the communiqu√© of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the workers fought against the flood. They said, "Conquer the flood and ask coal from the heavens," and "Even if the sky falls, we will still work." After four drainage campaigns and more than ten days of hard work, they finally overcame the severe flood. Immediately afterwards, the coal rush war was launched, and the annual national plan was completed more than a month ahead of schedule. The overall situation also launched a vigorous coal rush war, achieving the glorious achievement of completing the annual national plan twenty-five days ahead of schedule, and fulfilling the promise of reporting victory to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

More than two years of great leap forward practice has proved that it is not smooth sailing. In the process of the leap forward, it is full of struggles between two kinds of thinking, two roads, and two lines. In the struggle, the weapons we have mastered and used are to adhere to putting politics in command and constantly launch struggles against erroneous thoughts and lines. The so-called putting politics in command is putting Mao Zedong Thought in command. When the broad masses of the people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, their wisdom and strength will be endless, thus generating a huge material force. Practice has further proved that ideological revolution, production revolution, and technological revolution are mutually penetrating, mutually restrictive, and mutually causal. The process of the great leap forward is the process of ideological struggle between the new and the old, the advanced and the backward, the promotion and the conservatism, and it is also a process of constantly breaking superstitions and liberating the mind. Every time a superstition is broken, the mind is liberated once, and every time the mind is liberated, new things appear, and the emergence of new things promotes the doubling of production efficiency, so there is a continuous great leap forward. Just as Chairman Mao often taught us, the Party must lead everything, adhere to putting politics in command in all work, emphasize that political work is the lifeline of economic work, and that politics is the commander and soul of all work.

Sustained high-speed development of production also requires the earnest implementation of the Party's complete set of policies of walking on two legs. While paying attention to improving the production potential of large-scale modern groups, our city's coal production has also focused on small-scale local groups and small-scale modern groups. In 1959, picking coal, mining triangular coal, recovering coal pillars, and small well coal amounted to 2.8 million tons, accounting for 15.4% of the total output and 37% of the total increase. This is equivalent to the output of a large mine with an investment of over 100 million yuan, without national investment and equipment, as long as the mass movement is well organized and managed, it will increase the output of a large amount of coal for the country; Fuxin Station and Xinqiu Station, in cooperation with various mines, built twelve mechanized and semi-mechanized coal storage and loading equipment, which can store more than 800,000 tons of coal. These equipments were all built from indigenous to modern, from small to large, combining indigenous and modern methods, and relying on self-reliance. The average daily loading capacity is 1,600 vehicles, which has realized the ability to produce even if no trains come for three days and to load coal even if no production takes place for three days. This has liberated heavy manual labor and reduced the workforce by more than 2,000 people, increasing efficiency eleven times compared to manual loading. These are all victories of our Party's policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results and walking on two legs.

Vigorously promote the communist style of cooperation and continuously improve enterprise management and rules and regulations, that is, constantly adjust the superstructure and production relations, in order to continuously leap forward in production. A prominent example is that at the end of 1958, there were more than 1.5 million tons of fallen coal in the Fuxin mining area, and the time spent at Fuxin Station was as long as fourteen hours. After the experience of road-mine cooperation was created, more than 800 unreasonable rules and regulations were broken, and more than 700 new rules and regulations were established. The station stop time was shortened month by month, and has been shortened to the current five hours. The average station stop time in 1959 was 6.5 hours, which was 4.6 hours shorter per train than in 1958, saving the country 49,635 railcars. Inspired by the slogan of "ask for vehicles from time and ask for efficiency from cooperation" in road-mine cooperation, the Fuxin Coal Mine carried out large-scale intra-mine transportation cooperation in the Ping'an vertical shaft. The number of mine car turns increased from 2.8 times to 5.1 times, asking for more than 200 vehicles from time and solving the contradiction between transportation and production. The Haizhou open-pit mine vigorously carried out large-scale cooperation in loading, pulling, and overturning. The number of turns of self-overturning vehicles increased from more than seven times to more than eleven times, greatly shortening the station stop time and solving the problem of insufficient self-overturning vehicles. At present, Fuxin Station and relevant stations have launched a one-stop transportation cooperation, and a new situation of external large-scale cooperation of dragons dancing has emerged, which has powerfully supported the great leap forward of various industrial enterprises.

Since the Great Leap Forward, we have conscientiously implemented Chairman Mao's principle of continuous revolution. The continuous three-year great leap forward in coal is in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on continuous revolution, constantly leaping forward. Road-mine cooperation initially solved contradictions such as unified scheduling and created twelve major unifications; then it created red flag trains; major repairs of coal storage warehouses and loading equipment; overall transformation of station lines and relocation of coal preparation plants. When a contradiction is resolved, production takes a leap, and then new contradictions arise, and then new contradictions are addressed. In this way, new contradictions constantly arise and are resolved, new experiences are constantly created and developed, production is constantly leaping forward, and developing forward in ever-higher waves.

Waging a technological revolution requires the spirit of "not giving up" in three aspects: not giving up until success, not giving up until popularized, and not giving up until complete victory.

The new upsurge of technological innovation and technological revolution in Fuxin City began with the successful creation of a "Red Flag No. 1" coal loader. Subsequently, Ping'an Mine created a "59-Chain" coal loader, which was widely popularized after the Municipal Party Committee convened an on-site meeting. In just five days and nights, it was universally popularized. As a result, more than 2,400 coal loaders bid farewell to the large iron shovels used for generations, liberating heavy manual labor and increasing coal loading efficiency by four to five times. This one process alone reduced the workforce by 950 workers. The miners praised the coal loader and said:

"For many years, we wielded large shovels,
Sweat dripped down our waists,
Now we hold the coal loader,
One bite is better than a dozen shovels,
This is thanks to the Party's good leadership,
Miners can stand up straight when loading coal."

The coal loader is like a key that opens the treasure house of wisdom of the broad masses. Inspired by the coal loader, a technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization has spread rapidly throughout the city like wildfire. Workers, engineering and technical personnel, and cadres from major production jobs such as coal mining, tunneling, steel, processing, repair, and loading and unloading, all the way to cooks, nannies, and miscellaneous personnel who watch cars, as well as family members of workers, have all been involved in the torrent of technological innovation and technological revolution to revolutionize the heavy manual labor of hoeing, pushing, carrying, lifting, digging, and swinging. For example, the semi-hydraulic pithead of Ping'an Mine freezes very high in winter, and 25 workers have to chop ice every day, which hinders vehicle traffic. The worker Zhang Shusen used his brain and successfully developed an "ice scraper," which can complete the work of 25 people in one day in one hour, increasing efficiency by 380 times. In this way, the city created a total of 752 machines by March 10. Following the coal loader, it has also realized mechanization of pit timber transportation, mechanization of pillar return, mechanization of coal mud excavation, mechanization of overturning gangue, mechanization of coal loading, mechanization of rock loading, etc. With the exception of shifting chutes and supporting sheds, the degree of mechanization of direct jobs in coal mines has reached 85%, and some have already been automated and semi-automated.

At present, the coal mine and railway workers in Fuxin, in the movement of developing a hundred red flags, a thousand pacesetters, and ten thousand red flag bearers proposed by the Municipal Party Committee, are extensively and deeply carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. In order to solve the contradiction that stripping is lagging behind coal mining, Fuxin Coal Mine broke the old routine and realized short-distance soil disposal, increasing from the original four soil disposal sites to nineteen (reaching thirty-one by the end of the year). The total soil disposal volume is 220 million cubic meters, which shortens the transportation distance by an average of 4.13 kilometers. The operation time for one transport is shortened by about 35%, which can strip 12 million to 14 million cubic meters more throughout the year, expose more than 3 million tons of coal, and mine more than 2 million tons of coal. Therefore, the Haizhou open-pit mine, which is designed to produce 3 million tons annually, not only greatly exceeds the designed output, but can also achieve one mine turning into three mines this year, tripling the designed output. Underground, due to the in-depth development of the coal loader and small-scale mechanization movement, as well as the matching of various advanced experiences, the coal mining progress has been greatly accelerated. The average daily progress of the coal mining face was 1.26 meters last year, and now a group of high-yield production faces have emerged, reaching a level of 6 meters per day. The output per unit area has been continuously improved. The coal mining face in the first quarter of this year has been greatly improved compared to the fourth quarter of last year. In particular, since the beginning of this year, new coal mining methods with revolutionary characteristics have been constantly emerging, making coal output and efficiency increase by two or three times, and some have increased efficiency by ten times. So far, a group of three-free working faces (no pit timber, no chutes, no miners wielding shovels) has emerged, and the coal mining monthly progress of 100 meters and the tunneling monthly progress of 1,000 meters competition movement are vigorously developing. Through technical performance competitions, counterpart competitions, opponent competitions, and one-stop cooperation competitions, millions of pacesetters and red flag bearers have emerged. The combination of the inside and outside (the combination of universities, scientific research institutions, and factories; the combination of leading cadres, workers, and engineering and technical personnel) has promoted the technological revolution movement, and new inventions and creations have emerged continuously, which will push the socialist competition of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping to a new peak. Due to the continuous increase in the degree of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, more than 7,000 people have been liberated from heavy manual labor and manual operation. In the first quarter, coal mines have reduced their workforce by more than 5,000 people to support new districts and capital construction units, and plan to reduce another 5,000 people by the end of the year. The slogan "Increase production without increasing manpower, increase production and reduce manpower" put forward by the Municipal Party Committee has become a reality. While the technological revolution in coal production is underway, the technological revolution in coal transportation is also advancing by leaps and bounds. After the Fuxin Railway Station has experienced three road-mine cooperation with the "Red Flag Train", the mechanization and semi-mechanization of coal storage and loading equipment and the overall transformation of station lines, they are also expanding coal preparation plants in Haizhou Mine and Ping'an Mine into five automatic loading lines. Before the "May 1st" Labor Day, all the lines will be handed over to production. After the train arrives at the station, it does not need to be disassembled. After the entire train passes through the coal preparation plant, it will leave the station without stopping the wheels, revolutionizing the life of marshalling and hooking. At that time, the Fuxin Station's stop time can be shortened to three hours, saving a large number of vehicles for the country, shortening four times shorter than the stop time in 1958. This is a fundamental revolution in railway transportation work.

The high tide of technological innovation and technological revolution is bound to be a high tide of communist ideology. Technological innovation and technological revolution are changing people's old habits, and the relationship between people is also changing. For example, in the past, coal miners regarded the person with the greatest strength as the most capable person, and gave them nicknames such as "Little Tiger," "Little Electric Drill," and "Hercules"; now, innovation experts have become the most popular people, and they also have nicknames, such as "All-rounder," "Expert Competitor," "Innovation Fan," etc. In the past, innovation was mostly thought about by one person, but now it is studied by the combination of leaders, workers, and technicians, collective creation, and collective invention, which has greatly promoted people's collectivist spirit. One person's innovation and everyone's help has become a new social atmosphere. The upsurge of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement has promoted the development of the cultural revolution. In the past, it was difficult to organize cultural learning for coal miners, but now they have developed a habit of learning. At present, there are two types of books in short supply in Xinhua bookstores: one is Chairman Mao's works, and the other is popular science and technology readings. This situation makes us see that the technological innovation and technological revolution movement is constantly developing to a higher stage, not only promoting the continuous development of productive forces, but also setting off a heat wave of learning theory, culture, and technology, creating conditions for eliminating the difference between manual labor and mental labor.

In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, one thing that deserves special attention from leaders at all levels is the attitude towards new things. Many examples tell us that the emergence of a new thing will always encounter various forces hindering its birth, growth, and development. At the same time, it also tells us that new things have unlimited vitality, and they play an important role in a larger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. For example, since 1956, workers have proposed more than 100 plans to put down the iron shovel for the coal loader, but due to the suppression of conservative ideas, it was not able to come out early. Last winter, the Municipal Party Committee made the greatest determination and put forward the slogan of not giving up in three aspects, that is, not giving up until success, not giving up until popularized, and not giving up until complete victory. As a result, the first coal loader was born and was quickly promoted and developed. Another example is that in the technological transformation of soil disposal in the Haizhou open-pit mine, workers proposed many short-distance soil disposal plans several years ago. Because cadres had the idea of pursuing largeness and foreignness, they asked the country for 43 kilometers of railway and an investment of more than 11 million yuan, but it did not materialize for two years. This year, the Municipal Party Committee emphasized that the policy of walking on two legs must be implemented, adhering to the principle of self-reliance, using foreign methods if possible, and indigenous methods if not. They designed and constructed at the same time, without asking the country for investment, and completed the project and opened it to traffic in one month. In order to make new things born, grow, and develop rapidly, party organizations and business leaders must always maintain a clear mind, be good at keenly discovering new things, adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen political and ideological leadership, and clear ideological obstacles and give strong support for the birth, growth, and development of new things.

Every day there is a leap forward, everything strives for the top, and we strive to complete the annual raw coal plan ahead of schedule.

The people of Fuxin City firmly unite with the people of the whole country, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, holding high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and the red flags of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, to enable our country to catch up with or surpass Britain in terms of the output of major industrial products in a shorter period of time; To realize the modernization of our country's industry, agriculture, and science and technology as soon as possible, so as to build our country into a powerful socialist country. We are determined to make greater revolutionary efforts in the great leap forward of 1960, redouble our efforts to do all kinds of work well, strive for a leap forward every day, and strive for the top in everything. Coal and transportation are the two pioneers of the national economy. We must strive to complete the annual national plan for raw coal ahead of schedule, and in coal transportation, we must hold high the red flag of Fuxin road-mine cooperation experience, vigorously develop dragon networking, and ask for vehicles from time. The average annual stop time of Fuxin Station should be ensured at 5.5 hours, and strive for 4.5 hours; Xinqiu Station should ensure 5 hours, and strive for 4 hours. In order to produce more coal and transport it quickly, and powerfully support the great leap forward of the national economy. Continue to carry out technological revolution and cultural revolution movements in the coal industry in a deep way, and strive to realize mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, hydraulicization, and semi-hydraulicization as soon as possible.

Although our city has done some work and achieved some success in the past, we are still far behind the requirements of the Party and compared with advanced areas. In the future, we must mobilize cadres and people throughout the city, strive to study Chairman Mao's works, improve the level of Marxism-Leninism, and painstakingly study and truly grasp its spirit and essence, as an ideological weapon to guide the great leap forward. Vigorously promote the communist style of cooperation, vigorously carry out the ideological, production, technological, and cultural revolutions, vigorously strengthen scientific research work, march towards high, precise, and cutting-edge technology and new technologies, climb the peak of world science and technology, and strive for more and greater honor for the motherland. Leap forward, leap forward again and again!
