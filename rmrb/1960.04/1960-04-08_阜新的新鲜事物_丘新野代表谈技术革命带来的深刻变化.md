In the past, coal miners regarded the strongest person as the most capable, and gave them nicknames such as "Little Tiger," "Little Electric Drill," and "Hercules"; now, innovation experts have become the most popular people, and they also have nicknames: "All-rounder," "Expert Competitor," "Innovation Fan," etc. Currently, there are two types of books in short supply in Xinhua bookstores: one is Chairman Mao's works, and the other is popular science and technology readings. A climax of learning theory and culture has arrived with the climax of the technological revolution.

Fellow deputies:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget draft, and I guarantee to resolutely implement them in my work. The Fuxin area, like all parts of the country, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the direct leadership of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, has achieved continuous great leaps forward since 1958. Now, I will give a brief report to the conference on the development of coal production and coal transportation.

Ideological revolution, production revolution, and technological revolution are mutually causal; facts prove that one ideological liberation leads to the emergence of new things, and the emergence of new things greatly promotes production efficiency.

Fuxin is one of the important coal industrial bases in China. There are more than a thousand factories, mines, and users that use Fuxin coal as raw material and fuel. This arduous and glorious task requires us to produce more coal and transport it faster with the greatest effort to support the national great leap forward. In 1958, the output of raw coal by the Fuxin Mining Bureau was 13.6 million tons, an increase of 80% compared with 1957. This was a great leap forward. In 1959, the output of raw coal increased by 34% compared with 1958. This was another great leap forward. In the first quarter of this year, the Fuxin Mining Bureau completed the state coal production plan eleven and a half days ahead of schedule. The production level increased by 36% compared with the same period last year, and even increased by 11% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, which had the highest output. Compared with the national plan, overall efficiency increased by 14.6%. The cost of raw coal decreased by 8.5%. The quality and variety also met the national requirements. Tunneling and stripping also overfulfilled the state plan. At the same time, coal transportation work has also developed greatly. The average time spent at Fuxin Station in the first quarter was 5.4 hours, which was 1.1 hours shorter than the 6.5 hours target last year. The average time spent at Xiqiu Station was 4.2 hours, which was more than 3 hours shorter than last year. Other indicators were also completed very well. The victory of the "red opening" and "red everywhere" in the first quarter not only completely changed the old routine of coal industry being loose at the beginning and tight at the end for many years, but also symbolized that 1960 would be another great leap forward, and a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. Just as the workers said, "This year's comprehensive great leap forward is solid as iron." Based on this year's great leap forward situation, coupled with the huge potential of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, there will be a greater leap forward in coal production this year. After three consecutive years of great leaps forward, the output of Fuxin coal mines will triple compared to 1957. This vivid fact powerfully shattered the right-leaning opportunists' slander against the great leap forward.

The fundamental reason why Fuxin has been able to achieve continuous great leaps forward in industry and various tasks since 1958 is that the Fuxin Municipal Party Committee, under the correct leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, held high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and the "Three Banners," earnestly implemented the general line of building socialism formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, as well as a complete set of policies of walking on two legs, breaking superstitions, liberating the mind, putting politics in command, continuously revolutionizing, and vigorously carrying out mass movements.

More than two years of great leap forward practice has proved that Mao Zedong Thought is the truth for the great leap forward and high-speed development of socialist construction, a great driving force for mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people, and a lighthouse for continuous revolution and continuous great leap forward. Where the working people have mastered Mao Zedong Thought, there they are high-spirited, full of energy, with thousands of troops and horses, invincible, production is booming, and tasks are overfulfilled. Conversely, where Mao Zedong Thought is abandoned, there they are dispirited, frowning, fighting alone, at a loss, production is declining day by day, and tasks are not completed. There was such a lesson last year. In May and June of 1959, due to the rise of right-leaning opportunist thought, a gust of cold wind was blown under the guise of implementing the coal plan, and May and June, which were originally good production seasons, resulted in a low-yield situation. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the whole city greatly opposed right-leaning and greatly encouraged efforts, and production rose in a straight line. In July and August, there were more than thirty days of continuous rainfall, and all open-pit mines suffered severe floods. The Haizhou open-pit mine accumulated more than 900,000 cubic meters of water, submerged more than 1,700 meters of mine ditches, and almost the entire mine was shut down. However, inspired by the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the workers fought against the flood. They said, "Conquer the flood and ask coal from the heavens," and "Even if the sky falls, we will still work." After four drainage campaigns and more than ten days of hard work, they finally overcame the severe flood. Immediately afterwards, the coal rush war was launched, and the annual national plan was completed more than a month ahead of schedule. The overall situation also launched a vigorous coal rush war, achieving the glorious achievement of completing the annual national plan twenty-five days ahead of schedule, and fulfilling the promise of reporting victory to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

More than two years of great leap forward practice has proved that it is not smooth sailing. In the process of the leap forward, it is full of struggles between two kinds of thinking, two roads, and two lines. In the struggle, the weapons we have mastered and used are to adhere to putting politics in command and constantly launch struggles against erroneous thoughts and lines. The so-called putting politics in command is putting Mao Zedong Thought in command. When the broad masses of the people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, their wisdom and strength will be endless, thus generating a huge material force. Practice has further proved that ideological revolution, production revolution, and technological revolution are mutually penetrating, mutually restrictive, and mutually causal. The process of the great leap forward is the process of ideological struggle between the new and the old, the advanced and the backward, the promotion and the conservatism, and it is also a process of constantly breaking superstitions and liberating the mind. Every time a superstition is broken, the mind is liberated once, and every time the mind is liberated, new things appear, and the emergence of new things promotes the doubling of production efficiency, so there is a continuous great leap forward. Just as Chairman Mao often taught us, the Party must lead everything, adhere to putting politics in command in all work, emphasize that political work is the lifeline of economic work, and that politics is the commander and soul of all work.

Sustained high-speed development of production also requires the earnest implementation of the Party's complete set of policies of walking on two legs. While paying attention to improving the production potential of large-scale modern groups, our city's coal production has also focused on small-scale local groups and small-scale modern groups. In 1959, picking coal, mining triangular coal, recovering coal pillars, and small well coal amounted to 2.8 million tons, accounting for 15.4% of the total output and 37% of the total increase. This is equivalent to the output of a large mine with an investment of over 100 million yuan, without national investment and equipment, as long as the mass movement is well organized and managed, it will increase the output of a large amount of coal for the country; Fuxin Station and Xinqiu Station, in cooperation with various mines, built twelve mechanized and semi-mechanized coal storage and loading equipment, which can store more than 800,000 tons of coal. These equipments were all built from indigenous to modern, from small to large, combining indigenous and modern methods, and relying on self-reliance. The average daily loading capacity is 1,600 vehicles, which has realized the ability to produce even if no trains come for three days and to load coal even if no production takes place for three days. This has liberated heavy manual labor and reduced the workforce by more than 2,000 people, increasing efficiency eleven times compared to manual loading. These are all victories of our Party's policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results and walking on two legs.

Vigorously promote the communist style of cooperation and continuously improve enterprise management and rules and regulations, that is, constantly adjust the superstructure and production relations, in order to continuously leap forward in production. A prominent example is that at the end of 1958, there were more than 1.5 million tons of fallen coal in the Fuxin mining area, and the time spent at Fuxin Station was as long as fourteen hours. After the experience of road-mine cooperation was created, more than 800 unreasonable rules and regulations were broken, and more than 700 new rules and regulations were established. The station stop time was shortened month by month, and has been shortened to the current five hours. The average station stop time in 1959 was 6.5 hours, which was 4.6 hours shorter per train than in 1958, saving the country 49,635 railcars. Inspired by the slogan of "ask for vehicles from time and ask for efficiency from cooperation" in road-mine cooperation, the Fuxin Coal Mine carried out large-scale intra-mine transportation cooperation in the Ping'an vertical shaft. The number of mine car turns increased from 2.8 times to 5.1 times, asking for more than 200 vehicles from time and solving the contradiction between transportation and production. The Haizhou open-pit mine vigorously carried out large-scale cooperation in loading, pulling, and overturning. The number of turns of self-overturning vehicles increased from more than seven times to more than eleven times, greatly shortening the station stop time and solving the problem of insufficient self-overturning vehicles. At present, Fuxin Station and relevant stations have launched a one-stop transportation cooperation, and a new situation of external large-scale cooperation of dragons dancing has emerged, which has powerfully supported the great leap forward of various industrial enterprises.

Since the Great Leap Forward, we have conscientiously implemented Chairman Mao's principle of continuous revolution. The continuous three-year great leap forward in coal is in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on continuous revolution, constantly leaping forward. Road-mine cooperation initially solved contradictions such as unified scheduling and created twelve major unifications; then it created red flag trains; major repairs of coal storage warehouses and loading equipment; overall transformation of station lines and relocation of coal preparation plants. When a contradiction is resolved, production takes a leap, and then new contradictions arise, and then new contradictions are addressed. In this way, new contradictions constantly arise and are resolved, new experiences are constantly created and developed, production is constantly leaping forward, and developing forward in ever-higher waves.

Waging a technological revolution requires the spirit of "not giving up" in three aspects: not giving up until success, not giving up until popularized, and not giving up until complete victory.

The new upsurge of technological innovation and technological revolution in Fuxin City began with the successful creation of a "Red Flag No. 1" coal loader. Subsequently, Ping'an Mine created a "59-Chain" coal loader, which was widely popularized after the Municipal Party Committee convened an on-site meeting. In just five days and nights, it was universally popularized. As a result, more than 2,400 coal loaders bid farewell to the large iron shovels used for generations, liberating heavy manual labor and increasing coal loading efficiency by four to five times. This one process alone reduced the workforce by 950 workers. The miners praised the coal loader and said:

"For many years, we wielded large shovels,
Sweat dripped down our waists,
Now we hold the coal loader,
One bite is better than a dozen shovels,
This is thanks to the Party's good leadership,
Miners can stand up straight when loading coal."

The coal loader is like a key that opens the treasure house of wisdom of the broad masses. Inspired by the coal loader, a technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization has spread rapidly throughout the city like wildfire. Workers, engineering and technical personnel, and cadres from major production jobs such as coal mining, tunneling, steel, processing, repair, and loading and unloading, all the way to cooks, nannies, and miscellaneous personnel who watch cars, as well as family members of workers, have all been involved in the torrent of technological innovation and technological revolution to revolutionize the heavy manual labor of hoeing, pushing, carrying, lifting, digging, and swinging. For example, the semi-hydraulic pithead of Ping'an Mine freezes very high in winter, and 25 workers have to chop ice every day, which hinders vehicle traffic. The worker Zhang Shusen used his brain and successfully developed an "ice scraper," which can complete the work of 25 people in one day in one hour, increasing efficiency by 380 times. In this way, the city created a total of 752 machines by March 10. Following the coal loader, it has also realized mechanization of pit timber transportation, mechanization of pillar return, mechanization of coal mud excavation, mechanization of overturning gangue, mechanization of coal loading, mechanization of rock loading, etc. With the exception of shifting chutes and supporting sheds, the degree of mechanization of direct jobs in coal mines has reached 85%, and some have already been automated and semi-automated.

At present, the coal mine and railway workers in Fuxin, in the movement of developing a hundred red flags, a thousand pacesetters, and ten thousand red flag bearers proposed by the Municipal Party Committee, are extensively and deeply carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. In order to solve the contradiction that stripping is lagging behind coal mining, Fuxin Coal Mine broke the old routine and realized short-distance soil disposal, increasing from the original four soil disposal sites to nineteen (reaching thirty-one by the end of the year). The total soil disposal volume is 220 million cubic meters, which shortens the transportation distance by an average of 4.13 kilometers. The operation time for one transport is shortened by about 35%, which can strip 12 million to 14 million cubic meters more throughout the year, expose more than 3 million tons of coal, and mine more than 2 million tons of coal. Therefore, the Haizhou open-pit mine, which is designed to produce 3 million tons annually, not only greatly exceeds the designed output, but can also achieve one mine turning into three mines this year, tripling the designed output. Underground, due to the in-depth development of the coal loader and small-scale mechanization movement, as well as the matching of various advanced experiences, the coal mining progress has been greatly accelerated. The average daily progress of the coal mining face was 1.26 meters last year, and now a group of high-yield production faces have emerged, reaching a level of 6 meters per day. The output per unit area has been continuously improved. The coal mining face in the first quarter of this year has been greatly improved compared to the fourth quarter of last year. In particular, since the beginning of this year, new coal mining methods with revolutionary characteristics have been constantly emerging, making coal output and efficiency increase by two or three times, and some have increased efficiency by ten times. So far, a group of three-free working faces (no pit timber, no chutes, no miners wielding shovels) has emerged, and the coal mining monthly progress of 100 meters and the tunneling monthly progress of 1,000 meters competition movement are vigorously developing. Through technical performance competitions, counterpart competitions, opponent competitions, and one-stop cooperation competitions, millions of pacesetters and red flag bearers have emerged. The combination of the inside and outside (the combination of universities, scientific research institutions, and factories; the combination of leading cadres, workers, and engineering and technical personnel) has promoted the technological revolution movement, and new inventions and creations have emerged continuously, which will push the socialist competition of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping to a new peak. Due to the continuous increase in the degree of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, more than 7,000 people have been liberated from heavy manual labor and manual operation. In the first quarter, coal mines have reduced their workforce by more than 5,000 people to support new districts and capital construction units, and plan to reduce another 5,000 people by the end of the year. The slogan "Increase production without increasing manpower, increase production and reduce manpower" put forward by the Municipal Party Committee has become a reality. While the technological revolution in coal production is underway, the technological revolution in coal transportation is also advancing by leaps and bounds. After the Fuxin Railway Station has experienced three road-mine cooperation with the "Red Flag Train", the mechanization and semi-mechanization of coal storage and loading equipment and the overall transformation of station lines, they are also expanding coal preparation plants in Haizhou Mine and Ping'an Mine into five automatic loading lines. Before the "May 1st" Labor Day, all the lines will be handed over to production. After the train arrives at the station, it does not need to be disassembled. After the entire train passes through the coal preparation plant, it will leave the station without stopping the wheels, revolutionizing the life of marshalling and hooking. At that time, the Fuxin Station's stop time can be shortened to three hours, saving a large number of vehicles for the country, shortening four times shorter than the stop time in 1958. This is a fundamental revolution in railway transportation work.

The high tide of technological innovation and technological revolution is bound to be a high tide of communist ideology. Technological innovation and technological revolution are changing people's old habits, and the relationship between people is also changing. For example, in the past, coal miners regarded the person with the greatest strength as the most capable person, and gave them nicknames such as "Little Tiger," "Little Electric Drill," and "Hercules"; now, innovation experts have become the most popular people, and they also have nicknames, such as "All-rounder," "Expert Competitor," "Innovation Fan," etc. In the past, innovation was mostly thought about by one person, but now it is studied by the combination of leaders, workers, and technicians, collective creation, and collective invention, which has greatly promoted people's collectivist spirit. One person's innovation and everyone's help has become a new social atmosphere. The upsurge of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement has promoted the development of the cultural revolution. In the past, it was difficult to organize cultural learning for coal miners, but now they have developed a habit of learning. At present, there are two types of books in short supply in Xinhua bookstores: one is Chairman Mao's works, and the other is popular science and technology readings. This situation makes us see that the technological innovation and technological revolution movement is constantly developing to a higher stage, not only promoting the continuous development of productive forces, but also setting off a heat wave of learning theory, culture, and technology, creating conditions for eliminating the difference between manual labor and mental labor.

In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, one thing that deserves special attention from leaders at all levels is the attitude towards new things. Many examples tell us that the emergence of a new thing will always encounter various forces hindering its birth, growth, and development. At the same time, it also tells us that new things have unlimited vitality, and they play an important role in a larger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. For example, since 1956, workers have proposed more than 100 plans to put down the iron shovel for the coal loader, but due to the suppression of conservative ideas, it was not able to come out early. Last winter, the Municipal Party Committee made the greatest determination and put forward the slogan of not giving up in three aspects, that is, not giving up until success, not giving up until popularized, and not giving up until complete victory. As a result, the first coal loader was born and was quickly promoted and developed. Another example is that in the technological transformation of soil disposal in the Haizhou open-pit mine, workers proposed many short-distance soil disposal plans several years ago. Because cadres had the idea of pursuing largeness and foreignness, they asked the country for 43 kilometers of railway and an investment of more than 11 million yuan, but it did not materialize for two years. This year, the Municipal Party Committee emphasized that the policy of walking on two legs must be implemented, adhering to the principle of self-reliance, using foreign methods if possible, and indigenous methods if not. They designed and constructed at the same time, without asking the country for investment, and completed the project and opened it to traffic in one month. In order to make new things born, grow, and develop rapidly, party organizations and business leaders must always maintain a clear mind, be good at keenly discovering new things, adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen political and ideological leadership, and clear ideological obstacles and give strong support for the birth, growth, and development of new things.

Every day there is a leap forward, everything strives for the top, and we strive to complete the annual raw coal plan ahead of schedule.

The people of Fuxin City firmly unite with the people of the whole country, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, holding high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and the red flags of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, to enable our country to catch up with or surpass Britain in terms of the output of major industrial products in a shorter period of time; To realize the modernization of our country's industry, agriculture, and science and technology as soon as possible, so as to build our country into a powerful socialist country. We are determined to make greater revolutionary efforts in the great leap forward of 1960, redouble our efforts to do all kinds of work well, strive for a leap forward every day, and strive for the top in everything. Coal and transportation are the two pioneers of the national economy. We must strive to complete the annual national plan for raw coal ahead of schedule, and in coal transportation, we must hold high the red flag of Fuxin road-mine cooperation experience, vigorously develop dragon networking, and ask for vehicles from time. The average annual stop time of Fuxin Station should be ensured at 5.5 hours, and strive for 4.5 hours; Xinqiu Station should ensure 5 hours, and strive for 4 hours. In order to produce more coal and transport it quickly, and powerfully support the great leap forward of the national economy. Continue to carry out technological revolution and cultural revolution movements in the coal industry in a deep way, and strive to realize mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, hydraulicization, and semi-hydraulicization as soon as possible.

Although our city has done some work and achieved some success in the past, we are still far behind the requirements of the Party and compared with advanced areas. In the future, we must mobilize cadres and people throughout the city, strive to study Chairman Mao's works, improve the level of Marxism-Leninism, and painstakingly study and truly grasp its spirit and essence, as an ideological weapon to guide the great leap forward. Vigorously promote the communist style of cooperation, vigorously carry out the ideological, production, technological, and cultural revolutions, vigorously strengthen scientific research work, march towards high, precise, and cutting-edge technology and new technologies, climb the peak of world science and technology, and strive for more and greater honor for the motherland. Leap forward, leap forward again and again!

    阜新的新鲜事物
    丘新野代表谈技术革命带来的深刻变化
    过去煤矿工人把力气最大的人看作是最能干的人，并且给他们送外号叫“小老虎”，“小电镐”，“大力士”；现在革新能手成了最受欢迎的人，他们也有外号：“万能人”，“赛专家”，“革新迷”，等等。目前新华书店有两种书籍供不应求：一种是毛主席的著作；一种是科学技术通俗读物。一个学理论、学文化的高潮，随着技术革命高潮到来了。各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，并保证在工作中坚决贯彻执行。阜新地区和全国各地一样，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在辽宁省委的直接领导下，1958年以来取得了连续大跃进。现在我仅就煤炭生产和煤炭运输工作的发展情况，向大会作一简要的汇报。
    思想革命、生产革命、技术革命三者互为因果；事实证明：思想解放一次，就有新事物出现，新事物一出现，就促进生产效率大大提高
    阜新是我国煤炭工业重要基地之一。以阜新煤炭为原料、燃料的厂矿和用户，有一千多个。这一艰巨而光荣的任务，就要求我们以最大努力多产煤，快运煤，来支援全国大跃进。阜新矿务局1958年原煤产量一千三百六十万吨，比1957年增长80％。这是一个大跃进。1959年原煤产量，又比1958年增长34％。这又是一个大跃进。今年一季度，阜新矿务局提前十一天半，完成了煤炭生产国家计划。生产水平与去年同期比，提高了36％，与去年产量最高的四季度比，还提高了11％。与国家计划相比，全员效率提高了14.6％。原煤成本降低了8.5％。质量、品种也都达到了国家要求。掘进、剥离也都超额完成了国家计划。与此同时，煤炭运输工作也有很大的发展。阜新车站在站停留时间，一季度平均为五点四小时，比去年六点五小时指标，又缩短了一点一小时。新丘车站在站停留时间平均为四点二小时，比去年缩短了三个多小时。其他指标也都完成的很好。首季开门红、满堂红的胜利，不仅彻底地改变了煤炭工业历年来前松后紧的老常规，而象征着1960年又是一个大跃进，而且还是一个更大更好更全面的跃进。正像工人们说的“今年全面大跃进，又是铁打的了。”根据今年的大跃进形势，再加上技术革新、技术革命运动的巨大潜力，今年煤炭生产会有更大的跃进。经过连续三年大跃进，阜新煤矿的产量将比1957年翻三番。这一活生生的事实，有力的粉碎了右倾机会主义分子对大跃进的污蔑。
    阜新自1958年以来，在工业上和各项工作中，所以能连续大跃进的根本原因，是阜新市委在省委的正确领导下，高举毛泽东思想和“三个万岁”红旗，认真贯彻了党中央和毛主席所制定的建设社会主义总路线，以及一整套两条腿走路的方针，破除迷信、解放思想、政治挂帅、不断革命，大搞群众运动的结果。
    两年多以来大跃进的实践证明，毛泽东思想是社会主义建设大跃进、高速度向前发展的真理，是调动广大人民群众积极性、创造性的伟大动力，是不断革命、连续大跃进的灯塔。那里劳动人民掌握了毛泽东思想，那里就斗志昂扬，干劲冲天，千军万马，所向无敌，生产蒸蒸日上，超额完成任务。反之，那里离开了毛泽东思想，那里就斗志消沉，愁眉苦脸，孤军奋斗，一筹莫展，生产日益下降，任务完不成。去年就有过这样的经验教训。1959年的五、6月份，由于右倾机会主义思想抬头，借煤炭计划落实之机，吹了一阵冷风，5、6月份本来是生产良好季节，结果却出现了低产局面。党的八届八中全会以后，全市大反右倾，大鼓干劲，生产则直线上升。7、8月份连续降雨三十多天，各露天矿遭到了特大水灾，海州露天矿积水九十多万立方米，淹没矿沟一千七百多米，几乎全矿停产。但是职工们在八届八中全会公报的鼓舞下，向洪水展开了搏斗。他们说：“战胜水灾，向老天爷要煤”，“天下尖刀子，顶锅也要干”。经过四次排水战役，苦战十几天，终于战胜了特大水患。紧接着展开了夺煤大战，结果提前一个多月完成了全年国家计划。全局也同样的轰轰烈烈地展开了夺煤大战高潮，以提前二十五天完成全年国家计划的辉煌成绩，实现了向党中央、毛主席报捷的诺言。
    两年多来的大跃进，实践证明，不是一帆风顺的。在跃进的过程中，充满着两种思想、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。在斗争中我们所掌握和运用的武器，就是坚持政治挂帅，不断地向错误思想和路线展开斗争。所谓政治挂帅就是毛泽东思想挂帅。广大群众以毛泽东思想武装起来，智慧和力量就会无穷无尽，从而产生了巨大的物质力量。实践中更加证明了：思想革命、生产革命、技术革命三者是互相渗透、互相制约和互为因果的。大跃进的过程就是新与旧、先进与落后、促进与保守的思想斗争过程，也是不断破除迷信、解放思想的过程。每当破除一次迷信，思想就解放一次，思想解放一次，就有新事物出现，新事物出现，就促进了生产效率成倍地提高，因此，就不断大跃进。正如毛主席经常教导我们的一样，党必须领导一切，在一切工作中坚持政治挂帅，强调政治工作是经济工作的生命线，政治是一切工作的统帅和灵魂。
    持续高速度发展生产，还必须认真贯彻党的一整套的两条腿走路方针。我市煤炭生产在注意提高大洋群生产潜力的同时，注意抓了小土群、小洋群的生产。1959年拣煤、采三角煤、回收煤柱和小井煤为二百八十万吨，占总产量15.4％，占增产总量37％。这是不用国家投资和设备，只要组织好管理好大搞群众运动，就给国家增产大量煤炭，相当于投资一亿多大矿井的产量；阜新车站和新丘车站与各矿协作，修建了机械化、半机械化储煤装车设备十二座，能储煤八十余万吨。这些设备都是由土到洋、由小到大、土洋结合、自力更生建设起来的，平均每日装车能力为一千六百车，已经实现了三天不来车也生产、三天不生产也装车，解放了笨重体力劳动，减下了两千多人，比人工装车提高效率十一倍。这些都是我党多快好省和两条腿走路方针的胜利。
    大兴共产主义协作之风，不断地改进企业管理工作和规章制度，也就是需要不断调整上层建筑与生产关系，才能使生产不断地跃进。突出的例如1958年末，阜新矿区落地煤一百五十多万吨，阜新车站在站停留时间长达十四小时，路矿协作经验创造以后，不合理的规章制度破了八百多条，新的规章制度建立了七百多条，站停时间一个月比一个月缩短，一直缩短到现在的五小时。1959年平均站停时间为六点五小时，每一列车比1958年缩短四点六小时，给国家节省车皮四万九千六百三十五辆。阜新煤矿在路矿协作“向时间要车辆、向协作要效率”的口号启示下，平安竖井大搞矿内运输大协作，矿车周转次数由二点八次提高到五点一次，向时间要出了二百多个车辆，解决了运输和生产的矛盾。海州露天矿大搞装、拉、翻的大协作，自翻车的周转次数，由七次多提高到十一次多，大大的缩短了站停时间，解决了自翻车不足问题。目前，阜新车站与各有关车站，展开了一条龙运输大协作，出现了群龙飞舞的外部大协作的新形势，有力地支援了各工业企业的大跃进。
    大跃进以来，我们认真地贯彻了毛主席的不断革命的原则。煤炭三年连续大跃进，就是按照毛主席不断革命的指示精神，不断地向前跃进的。路矿协作，开始时是解决调度统一等矛盾，创造了十二大统一；以后又创造了红旗列车；大修储煤仓和装车设备；站线的总体改造和选煤厂的拨迁。一个矛盾解决了，生产有了飞跃，接着又出现了新的矛盾，再着手解决新的矛盾。就这样，新的矛盾不断地出现和解决，新的经验不断创造和发展，生产不断地跃进，一浪高一浪地向前发展。
    大闹技术革命要有三不“罢休”的精神；不成功不罢休，不推广不罢休，不获全胜不罢休
    阜新市的技术革新、技术革命新高潮，是从一台“红旗一号”攉煤机创造成功开始的。接着，平安矿又创造一台“五九链式”攉煤机，经过市委召开现场会议推广后，仅仅在五昼夜当中，就普遍推广了。于是，二千四百多名攉煤工人与世世代代使用的大铁锹告别了，解放了笨重的体力劳动，提高了攉煤效率四、五倍。仅这一道工序就减下九百五十名工人。矿工们歌诵攉煤机说：
    多少年来攉大锹，
    汗珠流了一裤腰，
    如今手扶攉煤机，
    一口胜过十几锹，
    这是党的领导好，
    矿工攉煤直起腰。
    攉煤机像把钥匙一样，打开了广大群众智慧的宝库。在攉煤机的启示下，一个以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，像野火燎原一样，在全市迅猛异常地开展起来。从采煤、掘进、钢铁、加工、修配、装卸等主要生产工种的工人、工程技术人员和干部，一直到炊事员、保育员、看车子的勤杂人员，以及职工家属，都卷入到技术革新、技术革命洪流中，来革攉、推、背、扛、担、挖、抡等笨重体力劳动的命。譬如平安矿的半水利化坑口，一到冬天就结成很高的冰，每天要二十五名工人刨冰，妨碍车辆通行。工人张树森就动了脑筋，研究成功“刮冰机”，一个人操纵刮冰机一小时就干完二十五人一天的活，提高效率三百八十倍。就这样，全市到3月10日止，共创造出机具七百五十二件。继攉煤机之后，又实现了运坑木机械化、回柱机械化、挖煤泥机械化、翻?石机械化、装煤机械化、装岩机械化等，煤矿除移溜子、架棚以外，直接工种的机械化程度，已达到了85％，部分的已经自动化、半自动化了。
    目前，阜新煤矿和铁路职工，在市委提出开展百面红旗、千名标兵、万名红旗手运动中，正以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心，广泛深入地展开了技术革新和技术革命运动。阜新煤矿为了解决剥离落后于采煤的矛盾，打破了旧常规，实现了近距离排土，由原来的四处排土场增加到十九处（年末可达三十一处），总排土量是二亿二千万立方米，使运距平均缩短四点一三公里，运输一次的作业时间缩短35％左右，全年可多剥离一千二百到一千四百万立方米，多露煤三百多万吨，可以多采煤二百多万吨。因而，设计年产量三百万吨的海州露天矿，不仅大大超过设计产量，今年还可以做到一矿变三矿，比设计产量翻上三番。在井下由于攉煤机和小型机械化运动的深入开展以及各项先进经验配套成龙，采煤进度大大加快，去年采煤工作面日平均进度一点二六米，现在已出现一批高额丰产工作面，达到了日进六米的水平。单位面积产量不断提高，今年一季度采煤工作面比去年四季度又有很大的提高。特别是今年以来，新的带有革命性质的采煤方法不断出现，使煤炭产量和效率都增长了两三倍，有的效率提高十倍。到目前为止，已出现了一批三无工作面（无坑木、无溜子、无人攉锹），采煤月进百米、掘进月进千米竞赛运动正在蓬勃地开展着。通过技术表演赛、对口赛、对手赛、一条龙协作赛，涌现出千万名标兵和红旗手。内外三结合（大专学校、科学研究机关和工厂结合；领导干部、工人和工程技术人员结合）推动了技术革命运动，新的发明创造不断出现，它将把学、比、赶、帮的社会主义竞赛推向新的高峰。由于机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化程度不断增加，从而使七千多人解放了笨重体力劳动和手工操作，一季度煤矿已减下五千多人支援了新区和基本建设单位，计划到年底再减五千人。市委提出的“增产不增人，增产还要减人”的口号已经成为现实了。在煤炭生产技术革命的同时，煤炭运输技术革命也在大踏步的前进。阜新车站在“红旗列车”、贮煤装车设备机械化、半机械化和站线总体改造三个路矿协作经验后，又在海州矿和平安矿扩建选煤厂为五条自动装车线，于“五一”前可全部移交生产，列车到站后，不用解体，成列经过选煤厂不停轮装车就开出站，革掉了编组和捣钩的命。那时阜新车站站停时间可缩短到三小时，能给国家节约大量车辆，比1958年站停时间缩短四倍左右。这是铁路运输工作上带有根本性的革命。
    技术革新与技术革命的高潮，必然也是共产主义思想大发扬的高潮。技术革新、技术革命改变着人们的旧习惯，人与人之间的关系也发生了变化。例如过去煤矿工人把力气最大的人看作是最能干的人，并且给他们送外号叫“小老虎”、“小电镐”、“大力士”；现在革新能手成了最受欢迎的人，他们也有外号，比如
  “万能人”、“赛专家”、“革新迷”等等。过去搞革新是一个人琢磨的多，现在是领导、工人、技术人员三结合研究，集体创造，集体发明，使人们的集体主义精神大大的得到了发扬。一人革新大家帮作，成了新的社会风气。技术革新、技术革命运动的高涨，推动了文化革命的发展。过去采煤工人文化学习很难组织，现在已经养成了学习的风气。目前新华书店缺两种书籍，一种是毛主席的著作，一种是科学技术通俗读物。这种形势使我们看到技术革新，技术革命运动，不断的向更高的阶段发展，不仅促进生产力的不断发展，而且正在掀起一个学理论、学文化技术的热潮，为消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别创造了条件。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，特别值得各级领导注意的一件事，就是对新鲜事物的态度问题。很多事例告诉我们，一个新事物的出现，总会遇到各色各样的力量阻碍它诞生、成长和壮大。同时也告诉我们，新事物是有无限生命力的，它对更大更好更全面地跃进，起着重要的作用。例如攉煤机自1956年，工人提出放下铁锹的方案，先后达百余种，但由于受保守思想的压抑，未得早日问世。去冬市委下了最大决心，提出了三不罢休的口号，即不成功不罢休，不推广不罢休，不获全胜不罢休，结果第一台攉煤机诞生了，而且迅速得到了推广和发展。又如海州露天矿在排土的技术改造中，工人几年前曾提出不少近距离排土方案，由于干部存在贪大求洋思想，向国家要铁道四十三公里，投资一千一百多万元，结果闹了两年没有实现。今年市委强调提出必须贯彻两条腿走路方针，坚持了自力更生、能洋则洋、不能洋则土的原则，边设计、边施工，没有向国家要投资，大干一个月就竣工通车了。为了使新事物迅速诞生、成长和壮大，党的组织和企业领导者，必须时刻保持冷静的头脑，善于锐敏地发现新事物，坚持政治挂帅，加强政治思想领导，为新鲜事物的诞生、成长和壮大，扫清思想障碍和大力支持。
    天天有跃进，样样争上游，力争提前完成原煤年计划
    阜新市全市人民坚决和全国人民一道，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，高举毛泽东思想红旗和总路线、大跃进、人民公社红旗，为使我国在更短的时间内，在主要工业产品的产量方面，赶上或超过英国；为早日实现我国的工业、农业和科学技术的现代化，从而把我国建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家。我们决心在1960年的大跃进中，鼓足更大的革命干劲，加倍努力做好各项工作，要天天有跃进，样样争上游。煤炭和运输是国民经济的两大先行官。我们要努力做到提前完成全年的原煤国家计划，在煤炭运输上，要高举阜新路矿协作经验红旗，大搞龙网化，向时间要车辆。阜新车站站停时间全年平均确保五点五小时，力争四点五小时；新丘车站确保五小时，力争四小时。为了多产煤快运煤，有力地支援国民经济大跃进。在煤炭工业继续深入地开展技术革命和文化革命运动，为早日实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化、水力化、半水力化而奋斗。
    过去我市虽然作了一些工作，有了一点成绩，但和党对我们的要求以及与先进地区相比，我们还差的很多。今后一定要发动全市干部和人民，努力学习毛主席著作，提高马列主义水平，并刻苦的进行钻研，确实掌握其精神和实质，作为指导大跃进的思想武器。大兴共产主义协作之风，大闹思想、生产、技术和文化大革命，大力加强科学研究工作，向高、精、尖和新技术进军，攀登世界科学技术高峰，为祖国争取更多更大的荣誉。跃进跃进再跃进！
