Study Leninism, Propagate Leninism, Defend Leninism
Introducing Six Excerpts of Lenin's Statements
President of People's Publishing House, Wang Ziye

In commemoration of the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth, to widely propagate Leninism, and to assist the broad masses of the Chinese people in studying Leninism, we have edited and published six excerpts of Lenin's statements on the following issues: (1) Lenin on Imperialism as the Eve of the Proletarian Socialist Revolution, (2) Lenin on the Proletarian Revolution and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, (3) Lenin on the National Liberation Movement, (4) Lenin on War and Peace, (5) Lenin on Opposing Revisionism, (6) Lenin on a New Type of Revolutionary Proletarian Party.

Since Lenin led the Russian proletariat to break through the chains of imperialism on one-sixth of the earth's land, opening a new era for mankind's transition from capitalism to communism, a series of new and significant changes have occurred in world history over the past forty years. All these significant changes have proven the correctness of the entire truth of Marxism-Leninism. The forty years of Leninism's victory in the world are forty years of Leninism becoming increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people around the world.

When Lenin spoke about the "Communist Manifesto" at the end of 1913, he wrote: "All the basic principles are still correct today, written very vividly and timely, as if they were written yesterday." When we read Lenin's works now, we feel the same way: they are so correct, so vivid, and so timely, as if Lenin had just written them yesterday.

Everyone knows that Leninism is Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian socialist revolution. Under new historical conditions, Lenin not only restored the revolutionary content of Marxism that had been castrated by the Second International revisionists, but also further developed the revolutionary spirit of Marxism, thereby advancing Marxism to a new stage and pointing out a bright road for all exploited classes and oppressed people to truly escape the enslavement of capital imperialism and escape poverty, and move towards socialism. Therefore, all the works of Marx and Lenin are gospels for the oppressed and enslaved people of the world seeking their own liberation.

We are now facing a great new era, the main characteristic of which is that the strength of socialism exceeds the strength of imperialism, and the strength of the awakening of the people of all countries exceeds the strength of reaction, just as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the current international situation is "the East wind prevails over the West wind," that imperialism is rotting day by day, and socialism is getting better day by day.

Modern revisionists, represented by Tito, use the pretext of changes in the times to slander the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, saying that it is "outdated." This kind of slander, besides exposing their own faces as agents of imperialism, does not harm the brilliance of Marxism-Leninism in the slightest.

People who understand the truth can understand that although the world situation has undergone such tremendous changes, one thing has not changed: the essence of imperialism. If it has changed at all, it has become more and more reactionary, more and more brutal, and closer and closer to death. Therefore, for the working people of the whole world, Marx and Lenin's great doctrines are forever golden rules, evergreen.

These six excerpts of Lenin's statements fully embody the revolutionary spirit of Leninism, especially the hatred for imperialism and all reactionaries and the spirit of uncompromising and thorough struggle against them.

Lenin's excerpts of statements teach us to fully understand the essence of imperialism, to maintain revolutionary vigilance at all times, not to harbor any illusions about imperialism, and to fight imperialism to the end.

Lenin's excerpts of statements also teach us that we must link the struggle against imperialism with the struggle against revisionism, otherwise the cause of the proletarian socialist revolution cannot move forward. Throughout his brilliant life, Lenin waged continuous battles against revisionism and opportunism. In 1916, he proudly said: "This is my destiny. … This began in 1893. That is where the hatred of the philistines comes from. But, I will never abandon this destiny to talk about 'peace' with the philistines."

When modern revisionists cater to the needs of imperialism and shamelessly challenge Marxism-Leninism, seriously studying how Lenin fought against revisionists like Bernstein and Kautsky is a fighting task of practical significance for us.

The titles of these six excerpts of Lenin's statements are basically Lenin's original words, among which there are many famous quotes and aphorisms. The outline of each book's content can be seen from the table of contents of the six books, so the entire table of contents is introduced as follows:

Lenin on Imperialism as the Eve of the Proletarian Socialist Revolution

I. Imperialism is Monopoly, Decaying, and Dying Capitalism
    Imperialism is Monopoly Capitalism
    Imperialism is Parasitic or Decaying Capitalism
    Imperialism is Dying Capitalism

II. In the Era of Imperialism, All Contradictions of Capitalism are Unprecedentedly Sharpened
    Imperialism is a Group of Beasts and Robbers Who Plunder the World, Fight Each Other, and Slaughter Each Other
    In the Era of Imperialism, National Liberation Wars are Inevitable, and the Long-Term and Arduous Decisive Battle for National Liberation is About to Begin
    The Proletariat Has Reached the End of its Endurance and Will Inevitably Overthrow the Oppression of Capital by Ruthless Revolutionary Means
    Imperialists Always Want to Destroy Socialist Countries, but They are Bound to Fail

III. The United States is the Most Ferocious and Arrogant Imperialism
    A Small Handful of Billionaires Exercise Brutal Rule, and the Entire American People are in a State of Slavery
    The United States Expands Armaments to an Unprecedented Scale and Dominates the Capitalist World
    US Imperialism is the Strangler and Executioner of Revolutions in Various Countries

IV. State Monopoly Capitalism Has Not Changed the Nature of Capitalism, but Has Aggravated its Contradictions
    General Monopoly Develops into State Monopoly
    State Monopoly Capitalism is a Military Labor Camp for Workers and a Paradise for Capitalists
    State Monopoly Capitalism is the Most Complete Material Preparation for Socialism
    State Monopoly Capitalism is Undoubtedly Still Capitalism, and Reformists Call it Socialism in Order to Deny the Socialist Revolution

V. The Struggle Against Imperialism Must be Closely Linked with the Struggle Against Opportunism
    Kautsky's Entire Intention in Fabricating the "Super-Imperialism Theory" is Nothing More Than to Conceal the Extremely Profound Contradictions of Imperialism
    Opportunists are Bourgeois Elements Who Oppose the Proletarian Revolution, and are the True Lackeys of the Bourgeoisie in the Workers' Movement
    Without Carrying Out a Resolute, Ruthless, and Comprehensive Struggle Against Opportunists, There is No Question of Opposing Imperialism at All

VI. The October Revolution Broke the Chains of Imperialism and Raised the Banner of Struggle for the Complete Overthrow of Imperialism Before the Whole World

Lenin on the Proletarian Revolution and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat

I. The Fundamental Question of All Revolutions is the Question of State Power
    The Transfer of Power from One Class to Another is the Primary and Fundamental Sign of Revolution
    Without Political Power, No Matter What Laws or Elected Bodies Exist, They are Equal to Zero
    The Highest Manifestation of the Proletariat's Revolutionary Role in History is the Dictatorship of the Proletariat
    Only Those Who Acknowledge Class Struggle and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat are Marxists

II. To Strive to Destroy the Entire Old State Machine, Making the Armed Proletariat Themselves the Rulers
    The Bourgeois State Machine Must be Smashed, Must be Destroyed
    New State Organs of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat Must be Created
    The Replacement of the Bourgeois State by the Proletarian State Cannot be Realized Through "Self-Withering"; According to General Laws, it Can Only be Realized Through Violent Revolution

III. Usually the Reactionary Classes are the First to Use Violence; The Possibility of Peaceful Development of the Revolution is Very Small
    The Proletariat Wishes to Seize Power Peacefully, but the Bourgeoisie Will Not Automatically Give it Up
    The Possibility of Peaceful Development of the Revolution Emerges Only When Weapons are in the Hands of the People and There is No External Force Suppressing the People
    In the October Revolution, Revolutionary Violence Achieved a Brilliant Victory

IV. The Bourgeois Parliament Should be Utilized in a Revolutionary Spirit; Limiting the Class Struggle to Parliamentary Struggle Actually Means Turning to the Bourgeoisie
    Utilize the Parliamentary Platform to Expose Bourgeois Deception and Educate the Broad Masses
    Believing That One Can Obtain a Majority Through Voting and Then Seize Power is Utterly Foolish or Utterly Hypocritical

V. All Opportunities Must be Utilized to Obtain a Large Number of Allies
    The Worker-Peasant Alliance is a Necessary Condition for the Victory of the Socialist Revolution
    Must Unite with Hundreds of Millions of People in the Colonies to Jointly Launch a Revolutionary Offensive
    Must Very Carefully, Very Attentively, Very Cautiously, and Very Skillfully Utilize All "Cracks" Between Enemies on the One Hand, and Utilize All Opportunities to Obtain a Large Number of Allies on the Other Hand
    Not "Absolutely Uncompromising" but Being Good at Consolidating and Developing the Revolutionary Cause Through Necessary Compromises

VI. Opposing Revisionism is a Necessary Condition for the Proletarian Revolution to Achieve Victory
    The Difference Between Revisionism and Marxism Lies in the Opposition Between Peaceful Transition and Violent Transition
    Defeating Revisionism Can Win Over the Worker Masses and Lead the People to the Dictatorship of the Proletariat

VII. Only the Dictatorship of the Proletariat Can Realize the Transition from Capitalism to Communism
    The Dictatorship of the Proletariat is Not the End of Class Struggle, But the Continuation of Class Struggle in New Forms
    Only by Ruthlessly Suppressing the Resistance of the Exploiters Can Capitalism be Defeated and Eradicated
    The Dictatorship of the Proletariat is a Million Times More Democratic Than the Most Democratic Bourgeois Republic

VIII. Without the Leadership of the Communist Party, the Dictatorship of the Proletariat Cannot be Realized

Lenin on the National Liberation Movement

I. The Liberation Movement of Oppressed Nations is Part of the World Proletarian Revolution
    Nations Should be Divided into Oppressor Nations and Oppressed Nations
    The Liberation Movement of Oppressed Nations is a Positive Factor in Overthrowing International Imperialism
    The International Proletariat is a Reliable Ally of the National Liberation Movement

II. The Liberation Movement and Liberation War of Oppressed Nations are Inevitable, Progressive, and Revolutionary

III. The Proletariat Should Play a Leading Role in the National Liberation Movement
    The Proletariat Should Lead the Peasant Movement
    The Proletariat Should Both Unite with the Bourgeoisie Supporting the National Movement and Oppose its Compromising Nature

IV. Socialist Countries and the International Proletariat Must Assist the National Liberation Movement of Oppressed Nations
    Socialist Countries Should Help Oppressed Nations as Much as Possible
    The Proletariat of Imperialist Countries Must Directly Help the National Liberation Movement of Oppressed Nations

V. The National Liberation Movement of Oppressed Nations Plays a Very Huge Revolutionary Role in the World Revolutionary Movement

VI. Proletarians of All Countries and Oppressed Nations Unite

Lenin on War and Peace

I. How Marxists View War
    Communists Firmly Condemn War, But They Also Know That as Long as Classes Exist, War is Inevitable
    War is the Continuation of Politics by Other Means
    Not Unconditionally Opposed to All Wars, the Basic Question Lies in the Class Nature of War
    The Criminal Actions of Imperialist War are Bound to Promote the Revolutionization of the Masses
    The Victory or Defeat of War Ultimately Depends on the Will of the Masses

II. Modern War Arises from Imperialism
    War is the Inevitable Product of Capitalism
    Imperialist Peace is the Continuation of Imperialist Wartime Policy
    Kautsky Obliterates the Class Nature of War and Peace and Colludes with the Bourgeoisie

III. Socialist Countries Consistently Adhere to Peaceful Coexistence
    Socialist Countries Invariably Implement a Policy of Peace
    The View That it is Absolutely Impermissible to Conclude Any Treaty with Imperialists is Incorrect
    Capitalists Will Find Excuses to Fight, and We Should be Prepared to Deal with Any Sudden Incident at Any Time

IV. Peace Can Only be Won Through Struggle
    Anyone Who Thinks That the Bourgeoisie Will Bring Peace on a Plate is Very Naive
    Obstacles to Peace Come from Imperialism
    If You Hit the Enemy Hard, He Will Come to Make Peace
    The Struggle for Peace Must be Combined with Revolutionary Struggle

V. The National Liberation Movement is a Positive Factor in the Struggle for Peace and the Overthrow of Imperialism

VI. Only the Socialist System Can Free Mankind from War

Lenin on Opposing Revisionism

I. Revisionism is Sacrificing the Fundamental Interests of the Proletariat to Cater to the Needs of the Bourgeoisie
    The Theoretical Victory of Marxism Forced Its Enemies to Dress Up as Marxists
    Castrating the Revolutionary Content of Marxism and Praising What the Bourgeoisie Can Accept as the Top Priority
    Shouting That Marxist Theory is Incomplete and Outdated, and Using "New" Arguments and "New" Reasons to Defend Social Reform
    Ambiguous, Following the Trend, Lacking Any Clear and Firm Principles
    "The Ultimate Goal is Insignificant, the Movement is Everything," Bernstein's Words Best Show the Essence of Revisionism

II. Revisionism Tampering with Marxist Philosophy, Political Economy, and the Doctrine of Class Struggle
    In Philosophy, it Abandoned Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism, and Replaced "Cunning" (and Revolutionary) Dialectics with "Naive" (and Peaceful) "Evolutionism"
    "Revising" Marxist Political Economy, Expecting the Emergence of a Peaceful New Era of Capitalism
    Denying Class Struggle, Advocating Class Cooperation
    Slavishly Worshipping Bourgeois Democracy, Vainly Attempting to Use Universal Suffrage to Win a Majority and Seize State Power
    Vainly Attempting to Transition to Socialism Through Peaceful, Reformist Roads, Denying That Revolutionary Violence is the Basic Sign of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat
    Directly Retreating to Bourgeois Politics, Defending Colonial Wars and Barbaric Acts
    Without the Workers' Revolutionary Class Struggle View Against Capital, There is No Internationalism at All

III. Revisionism is a Reflection of Bourgeois Influence in the Workers' Movement
    Revisionism is a Product of the Era of "Peaceful" Development of the Workers' Movement
    The Social Pillar of Revisionism is the Aristocratic Class of Workers
    The Strategic Shift of the Bourgeoisie Caused Revisionism to Run Rampant in the Workers' Movement
    Revisionism is the Direct Product of the Bourgeois Worldview and its Influence

IV. A Resolute Struggle Must be Waged Against Revisionism
    Revisionism Gilds the Face of the Bourgeoisie, Fooling and Dividing the Working Class
    The Bourgeoisie Understands That it is Better to Use Revisionist Elements Within the Workers' Movement to Maintain the Bourgeoisie Than to Come Forward Themselves
    The Entire Significance of the Struggle Against Revisionism Lies in Going to the Lower and Lower Levels to Win Over the Masses
    Revisionism is an International Phenomenon, and This Abscess Must be Squeezed Out as Quickly and Carefully as Possible
    Communists Sometimes Make Mistakes, Just as Eagles Sometimes Fly Lower Than Chickens, But Chickens Can Never Fly as High as Eagles! Let the Revisionists Gloat!

V. Develop Marxism in the Struggle Against Revisionism and in Defense of Marxism
    The "Innovations" of the Revisionists Have Nothing, Only Retreat, Only Concessions to the Bourgeoisie
    Principles Must Never be Sold for Money, and No Theoretical "Concessions" Must be Made
    Develop Revolutionary Marxism to Oppose Revisionism

Lenin on a New Type of Revolutionary Proletarian Party

I. The Communist Party is a Party Guided by Marxist Theory, and it Must Have a Marxist Revolutionary Program
    Only a Party Guided by Marxist Theory Can Play the Role of an Advanced Fighter
    The Party Must Have a Revolutionary Political Program in Order to Adhere to its Own Line in Any Turning Period, Consolidate the Connections of Revolutionaries, and Attract the Masses to the Revolution
    The Essence of the Party's Program is to Organize and Lead the Class Struggle of the Proletariat, Striving for the Proletariat to Seize Power and Realize Socialism and Communism
    The Party's Program Should Stipulate the Party's Ultimate Goals, Not Forgetting the Overall Interests Because of Local Interests, and Not Forgetting the Fundamental Tasks Because of the Particularities of Individual Stages of Struggle. The Struggle Interests of the Proletariat in One Country Should be Subordinate to the Struggle Interests of the Proletariat Worldwide

II. The Party Must Use Revolutionary Methods to Seize Power
    In Order to Achieve the Ultimate Goal, the Party Must Transfer Power to the Working Class
    The Working Class of Course Wishes to Seize Power Peacefully, But Abandoning the Revolutionary Method of Seizing Power is a Disgraceful Concession to the Bourgeoisie and All Propertied Classes

III. The Party Must Lead Everything
    Only Under the Leadership of the Party Can the Autocratic System be Overthrown, Can We Move Towards the Communist Revolution, and Can the Dictatorship of the Proletariat be Realized
    The Party Must Lead All the Country's Political and Economic Work. Politics Cannot But Take Precedence Over Economics. The Party Must First Politically Lead the Masses to Establish a Socialist Economic Base and Concentrate the Management of the Entire National Economy in its Own Hands
    The Party Must Lead Cultural and Educational Work, Treating This Work as Part of the Task of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, Making it Serve Tens of Millions of Working People
    The Party Must Educate and Transform Bourgeois Intellectuals in the Communist Spirit. We Must Burn Them Red With the Flames of Our Initiative, So That They Operate Completely in Accordance With the Spirit of the Party

IV. The Party Must Support Revolutionary Mass Movements in All Aspects and Expand This Movement
    The Revolutionary Perseverance of the Masses is the Deepest Source of Revolutionary Victory
    The Party Must Educate the Masses With a Marxist Program and Guide Them to Engage in Very Extensive Revolutionary Struggles
    The Party Must Boldly Unleash the Creative Spirit of the Masses, So That the Socialist Cause Forms a Genuine Mass Movement
    The Party Must Persistently Instill Communist Principles Into the Minds of the Masses, Implement Communist Discipline, and Promote Communist Labor

V. The Party Must Have Leaders With Extremely High Prestige and the Most Experience
    Without Leaders With Extremely High Prestige and Experience, the Dictatorship of the Proletariat Will Become Empty Talk
    The Party's Leaders are the Most Prestigious, Most Experienced Revolutionaries Who Can Always Walk Ahead of the Revolutionary Spontaneity of the Masses and Solve Various Complex Political Problems Quickly and Correctly
    All Great Revolutionary Thinkers are Not Afraid to Learn From the Experience of the Great Movements of the Oppressed Classes
    Resolutely Support the Party's Leaders and Crush the Enemy's Shameless Slanders

VI. The Party Must Wage an Irreconcilable Struggle Against Opportunism and Revisionism. The Old-Style Party Advocating Social Reform Should be Fundamentally Transformed Into a New Type of Revolutionary Party
    Opportunists Deny Revolutionary Theory, Do Not Need Any Revolutionary Program, Revolutionary Party, or Revolutionary Tactics, But Aspire to Establish a Unified Democratic Party That Takes a Peaceful Road Through Reform and Through Class Cooperation
    The Party Must Implement a Political Line Against Opportunism in All Fields of Struggle, Transforming the Old-Type Party of Reformism Into a Truly Revolutionary New-Type Party

VII. The New-Type Proletarian Party is a Class-Based, Conscious, Fighting, Mass-Linked, Disciplined Revolutionary Party

    学习列宁主义　宣传列宁主义　保卫列宁主义
    介绍六本列宁言论摘录
    人民出版社社长　王子野
    为了纪念列宁诞生九十周年，为了广泛地宣传列宁主义，为了帮助我国广大人民群众学习列宁主义，我们编辑并出版了列宁论述下列问题的六本言论摘录：（一）列宁论帝国主义是无产阶级社会主义革命的前夜，（二）列宁论无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，（三）列宁论民族解放运动，（四）列宁论战争与和平，（五）列宁论反对修正主义，（六）列宁论新型的革命的无产阶级政党。
    自从列宁领导俄国无产阶级在地球六分之一的土地上冲破了帝国主义的锁链，开辟了人类由资本主义向共产主义过渡的新纪元，四十年来世界历史上发生了一连串的新的巨大的变化。所有这些巨大的变化，都证明了马克思列宁主义全部真理的正确性。列宁主义在世界上取得胜利的四十年，是列宁主义在世界上日益深入人心的四十年。
    列宁在1913年底讲到“共产党宣言”的时候，曾经这样写道：“一切基本原则直到今天还是正确的，写得非常生动而及时，就好像是昨天写成的。”我们现在来读列宁的著作，同样地感觉到它是那样正确，那样生动，那样及时，就好像列宁是昨天才写成的。
    谁都知道，列宁主义是帝国主义和无产阶级社会主义革命时代的马克思主义。列宁在新的历史条件下不仅恢复了被第二国际修正主义者所阉割的马克思主义的革命内容，而且进一步发展了马克思主义的革命精神，从而把马克思主义推进到一个新的阶段，为一切被剥削阶级和被压迫人民指明了一条真正能够摆脱资本帝国主义奴役和摆脱贫困、走向社会主义的光明大道。因此，马克思、列宁的全部著作都是全世界被压迫、被奴役的人民谋自身解放的福音书。
    我们现在面临着一个伟大的新时代，这个新时代的主要特点是社会主义的力量超过了帝国主义的力量，世界各国人民觉醒的力量超过了反动的力量，正如毛泽东同志所指出的现在的国际形势是“东风压倒西风”，是帝国主义一天天烂下去，社会主义一天天好起来。
    以铁托为代表的现代修正主义者借口时代的变化，诽谤马克思列宁主义的学说，说它“过时了，”。这种谰言，除了暴露他们自己是帝国主义代理人的嘴脸之外，是丝毫无损于马克思列宁主义的光辉的。
    明白道理的人都能懂得，尽管世界形势发生了如此巨大的变化，然而有一点是没有变的，这就是帝国主义的本质。如果说它也有变化的话，那就是愈变愈反动，愈变愈残暴，愈变愈接近死亡。所以，对于全世界的劳动人民，马克思、列宁的伟大学说永远是至理名言，万年长青。
    这六本列宁言论摘录，充分体现了列宁主义的革命精神，尤其是对帝国主义和一切反动派的憎恨以及对他们的毫不妥协的彻底斗争的精神。
    列宁的言论摘录教导我们，要充分认识帝国主义的本质，随时都要保持革命的警惕性，不能对帝国主义抱任何幻想，必须和帝国主义斗争到底。
    列宁的言论摘录还教导我们，必须把反对帝国主义的斗争同反对修正主义的斗争联系起来，否则无产阶级社会主义革命的事业就不能前进。列宁在他的光辉的一生中，同修正主义、机会主义进行了连续不断的战斗。他在1916年这样自豪地说过：“这就是我的命运。……这是从1893年开始的。庸人们的仇恨就是由此而来的。但是，我无论如何不会抛弃这个命运去同庸人们讲‘和平’。”
    当现代修正主义者迎合帝国主义的需要，无耻地向马克思列宁主义进行挑战的时候，认真学习列宁如何同修正主义者伯恩斯坦、考茨基之流进行战斗，这对我们来说是一项有现实意义的战斗任务。
    这六本列宁言论摘录的标题，基本上也都是列宁的原话，其中有不少名言警语。从六本书的目录上，便可以看出各书内容的轮廓，所以把全部目录介绍如下：
    列宁论帝国主义是无产阶级
    社会主义革命的前夜
    一、帝国主义是垄断的、腐朽的、垂死的资本主义
    帝国主义是垄断的资本主义
    帝国主义是寄生的或腐朽的资本主义
    帝国主义是垂死的资本主义
    二、在帝国主义时代，资本主义的一切矛盾空前尖锐化
    帝国主义是一群野兽和强盗，他们掠夺世界，互相争斗，互相厮杀
    帝国主义时代民族解放战争是不可避免的，争取民族解放的长期的艰苦的决战就要开始了
    无产阶级已忍无可忍，必然要用毫不留情的革命手段推翻资本的压迫
    帝国主义者总想摧毁社会主义国家，但他们是一定要失败的
    三、美国是最凶残最蛮横的帝国主义
    一小撮亿万富翁实行残暴统治，美国全体人民处于奴隶地位
    美国把军备扩大到空前规模，在资本主义世界称王称霸
    美帝国主义是各国革命的绞杀者和刽子手
    四、国家垄断资本主义没有改变资本主义的性质，而且加剧了它的矛盾
    一般垄断发展为国家垄断
    国家垄断资本主义是劳动者的军事苦役营，是资本家的天堂
    国家垄断资本主义是社会主义的最完备的物质准备
    国家垄断资本主义无疑还是资本主义，改良主义者把它叫做社会主义是为了否认社会主义革命
    五、反对帝国主义的斗争必须同反对机会主义的斗争密切联系起来
    考茨基捏造“超帝国主义论”的全部用意，无非是要掩饰帝国主义极其深刻的矛盾
    机会主义者是反对无产阶级革命的资产阶级分子，是资产阶级在工人运动中的真正走狗
    不同机会主义者展开坚决无情的全面斗争，就根本谈不上反对帝国主义六、十月革命打破了帝国主义的锁链，在全世界面前举起了为彻底推翻帝国主义而斗争的旗帜
    列宁论无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政
    一、一切革命的根本问题都是国家政权问题
    政权从一个阶级手里转到另一个阶级手里是革命首要的基本的标志没有政权，无论什么法律，无论什么选出的机关都等于零
    无产阶级在历史上的革命作用的最高表现是无产阶级专政
    只有承认阶级斗争同时也承认无产阶级专政的人，才是马克思主义者
    二、要为破坏全部旧的国家机器而奋斗，使武装的无产阶级自己成为执政者
    资产阶级的国家机器必须打碎、必须摧毁
    必须创立新的、无产阶级专政的国家机关
    资产阶级国家由无产阶级国家代替是不能经过“自行消亡”来实现的，根据一般规律，只能靠暴力革命来实现
    三、通常是反动阶级首先使用暴力，革命和平发展的可能性是非常小的
    无产阶级但愿和平地取得政权，资产阶级却不会自动地让出来
    武器掌握在人民手中，没有外力压制人民，才出现了革命和平发展的可能性
    在十月革命中，革命暴力取得了辉煌的胜利
    四、应该以革命精神利用资产阶级议会，把阶级斗争局限于议会斗争实际上就是转到资产阶级方面去
    利用议会讲坛，揭穿资产阶级骗局，教育广大群众
    认为利用投票方式取得多数然后才去夺取政权，这是绝顶的愚蠢或绝顶的虚伪
    五、必须利用一切机会获得大量的同盟者
    工农联盟是社会主义革命胜利的必要条件
    必须同殖民地亿万人民联合起来共同发动革命进攻
    必须极精细、极留心、极谨慎、极巧妙地一方面利用敌人之间的一切“裂痕”，另一方面要利用一切机会来获得大量的同盟者
    不是“绝对不妥协”而是要善于通过必要的妥协来巩固和发展革命事业
    六、反对修正主义是无产阶级革命获得胜利的一个必要条件
    修正主义和马克思主义的分歧，正在于和平转变同暴力转变的对立
    战胜修正主义就能争取工人群众，就能把人民引向无产阶级专政
    七、只有无产阶级专政，才能实现从资本主义到共产主义的过渡
    无产阶级专政不是阶级斗争的结束，而是阶级斗争在新形式中的继续
    只有无情地镇压剥削者的反抗，才能战胜和铲除资本主义
    无产阶级专政比最民主的资产阶级共和国要民主百万倍
    八、没有共产党的领导，便不能实现无产阶级专政
    列宁论民族解放运动
    一、被压迫民族解放运动是世界无产阶级革命的一部分
    应该把民族区分为压迫民族和被压迫民族
    被压迫民族解放运动是推翻国际帝国主义的积极因素
    国际无产阶级是民族解放运动的可靠的同盟者
    二、被压迫民族解放运动和解放战争是不可避免的、进步的、革命的
    三、无产阶级在民族解放运动中应该起领导作用
    无产阶级应该领导农民运动
    无产阶级既要同支持民族运动的资产阶级联合，又要反对它的妥协性
    四、社会主义国家和国际无产阶级必须援助被压迫民族解放运动
    社会主义国家要尽量帮助被压迫民族
    帝国主义国家的无产阶级必须直接帮助被压迫民族解放运动
    五、被压迫民族解放运动在世界革命运动中起着非常巨大的革命作用
    六、全世界无产者和被压迫民族联合起来
    列宁论战争与和平
    一、马克思主义者怎样看待战争
    共产党人坚决谴责战争，同时也知道，只要阶级存在，战争是不可避免的
    战争是政策的另一种手段的继续
    不是无条件地反对一切战争，基本问题在于战争的阶级性
    帝国主义战争的罪恶行为势必促进人民群众的革命化
    战争胜负归根到底决定于人民群众的意志
    二、现代战争产生于帝国主义
    战争是资本主义的必然产物
    帝国主义和平是帝国主义战时政策的继续
    考茨基抹杀战争与和平的阶级性质，和资产阶级同流合污
    三、社会主义国家一贯坚持和平共处
    社会主义国家始终不渝地执行和平政策
    认为绝对不允许同帝国主义者缔结任何和约的观点是不正确的
    资本家是会借口来打仗的，我们应当准备随时应付任何突然事变
    四、只有通过斗争才能赢得和平
    谁以为资产阶级会用盘子把和平端来，谁就是十分天真的人
    和平障碍来自帝国主义
    你打痛了敌人，他就会来讲和
    争取和平的斗争必须同革命斗争结合起来
    五、民族解放运动是争取和平、推翻帝国主义的积极因素
    六、只有社会主义制度才能使人类摆脱战争
    列宁论反对修正主义
    一、修正主义就是牺牲无产阶级的根本利益，迎合资产阶级的需要
    马克思主义在理论上的胜利，逼得它的敌人装扮成马克思主义者
    阉割马克思主义的革命内容，把资产阶级可以接受的东西放在第一位加以颂扬
    叫喊马克思学说不完备和过时了，用“新”论据和“新”理由为社会改良辩护
    模棱两可，随波逐流，缺乏任何明确和坚定的原则
    “最终目的是微不足道的，运动就是一切”，伯恩施坦的这句话最能表明修正主义的实质
    二、修正主义篡改马克思主义的哲学、政治经济学、阶级斗争学说在哲学上背弃了辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，用“素朴的”（而且是平静的）“进化论”代替“狡猾的”（而且是革命的）辩证法
    “修正”马克思主义政治经济学，期待出现资本主义的和平新纪元否认阶级斗争，鼓吹阶级合作
    奴隶似地崇拜资产阶级民主，妄想利用普选权争取多数，取得国家政权
    妄想通过和平的、改良主义的道路过渡到社会主义，否认革命暴力是无产阶级专政的基本标志
    直接退向资产阶级政策，替殖民战争及野蛮行为辩护
    没有工人反资本的革命阶级斗争观，根本没有国际主义
    三、修正主义是资产阶级影响在工人运动中的反映
    修正主义是工人运动“和平”发展时代的产物
    修正主义的社会支柱是工人贵族阶层
    资产阶级策略上的转折，使修正主义在工人运动中猖狂起来
    修正主义是资产阶级世界观及其影响的直接产物
    四、必须同修正主义进行坚决的斗争
    修正主义给资产阶级脸上贴金，愚弄和分化工人阶级
    资产阶级懂得：利用工人运动内部的修正主义分子来维护资产阶级，比他们亲自出马还好
    反对修正主义斗争的全部意义在于到更下层和更低层去争取群众
    修正主义是国际现象，必须尽快地和细心地把这块脓毒挤掉
    共产党人有时也犯错误，正如鹰有时比鸡飞得低，但是鸡却永远飞不到鹰那么高！让修正主义者去幸灾乐祸吧！五、在反对修正主义、保卫马克思主义的斗争中发展马克思主义修正主义者的“革新”，什么也没有，只是向后退，只是向资产阶级让步
    决不能拿原则来做买卖，决不能作理论上的“让步”
    发展革命的马克思主义来反对修正主义
    列宁论新型的革命的无产阶级政党
    一、共产党是以马克思主义理论为指南的政党，它要有马克思主义的革命纲领
    只有以马克思理论为指南的党才能起先进战士的作用
    党要有革命的政治纲领，才能在任何转折时期坚持自己的路线，巩固革命者的联系，把群众吸引到革命中来
    党的纲领的实质就是组织领导无产阶级的阶级斗争，争取由无产阶级取得政权，实现社会主义、共产主义
    党的纲领应当规定党的最终目的，不要因局部利益而忘记整体利益，不要因个别斗争阶段的特殊性而忘记根本任务。一个国家的无产阶级的斗争利益应当服从全世界无产阶级斗争的利益
    二、党要用革命的方法去夺取政权
    为了实现最终目的，党必须使政权转到工人阶级手里
    工人阶级当然愿意和平取得政权，但放弃用革命的方法夺取政权，就是对资产阶级和一切有产阶级的可耻让步
    三、党必须领导一切
    只有党的领导，才能推翻专制制度，走向共产主义革命，实现无产阶级专政
    党要领导国家的全部政治经济工作。政治同经济相比，不能不占首位，党首先要从政治上领导群众建立社会主义经济基础，把全部国民经济的管理集中在自己手中
    党要领导文化、教育工作，把这些工作当做无产阶级专政任务的一部分，使它为千千万万的劳动人民服务
    党要以共产主义精神教育、改造资产阶级知识分子。要用我们的主动精神的火焰把他们烧得通红，使他们完全按照党的精神办事
    四、党要从各方面支持革命的群众运动，并扩大这个运动
    群众的革命毅力是革命胜利最深的泉源
    党要以马克思主义纲领教育群众，引导他们投入非常广泛的革命斗争
    党要大胆发挥群众的首创精神，使社会主义事业形成真正的群众运动
    党要坚持不懈地把共产主义原则灌输到群众的思想中去，实行共产主义纪律，推行共产主义劳动
    五、党要有威信极高和最有经验的领袖
    党如果没有威信极高的、有经验的领袖，无产阶级专政就会成为一句空话
    党的领袖是最有威信、最有经验，能始终走在群众的革命自动性的前面、敏捷而正确地解决各种复杂政治问题的革命家
    一切伟大的革命思想家不怕向被压迫阶级的伟大运动的经验学习。
    坚决拥护党的领袖，粉碎敌人的无耻诽谤
    六、党要同机会主义、修正主义进行不调和的斗争。应当把主张社会改良的旧型的党根本改造成新型的革命的党
    机会主义者否认革命的理论，不需要任何革命纲领、革命政党和革命策略，而是渴望建立一个通过改良、通过阶级合作而走和平道路的统一的民主党
    党必须在一切斗争领域中贯彻反对机会主义的政治路线，把改良主义的旧型的党，改造成真正革命的新型的党
    七、无产阶级的新型的政党是阶级的、觉悟的、战斗的、联系群众的、有纪律的革命政党
