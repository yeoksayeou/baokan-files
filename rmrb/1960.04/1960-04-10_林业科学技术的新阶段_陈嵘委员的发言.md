Fellow Chairman and Committee Members:

I have attended this National People's Political Consultative Conference and studied Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national final accounts and the 1960 national budget draft. I have gained endless benefits in thought and politics, and as I have always studied forestry, I have been particularly inspired in this regard. I now want to express some thoughts:

Forests can regulate the climate, conserve water and soil, eliminate waterlogging, drought, wind and sand disasters, ensure abundant agricultural production, and produce timber and other diverse items to supply industrial raw materials and meet people's lives. According to years of research and investigation by various parties, every country must have a forest area of more than 30% of its total land area to play the role of transforming nature and enriching materials as mentioned above. China has a vast territory and good natural conditions, which are most suitable for the growth of various trees. However, due to the neglect of forestry in the old era and the large amount of destruction, at the beginning of liberation, China's forest area was only about 5% of the total land area. Until after liberation, the Party paid special attention to forestry and quickly adopted various important measures, so that forestry has been vigorously developed, and brilliant achievements have been made in a short period of ten years. Forestry scientific research has also made great progress in recent years under the Party's cordial care and correct leadership. Especially under the encouragement of the great leap forward situation in 1958 and 1959, forestry scientific research work has also seen a leap forward. Now I will only explain from several main aspects that the forestry science and technology of the new China is gradually entering a new stage of world forestry science and technology.

First, in the vast mountainous areas of southern China, there is a long history and rich experience in planting and managing Chinese fir, moso bamboo, and oil tea. Since liberation, in-depth research has been carried out on these tree species, which has greatly improved the productivity of these trees. For example, the accumulation of eight-year-old Chinese fir is 286.5 cubic meters per hectare, the output of new bamboo per hectare per degree of moso bamboo has exceeded 150,000 kilograms, and the oil production of oil tea per hectare has reached more than 1,500 kilograms. The oil production per mu in a small area of oil tea experimental field reached 300 kilograms. In 1958, the southern provinces made a preliminary summary of fast-growing and high-yield forests. Now many regions and units across the country are conducting experimental research on fast-growing and high-yield measures for local main tree species, which will open up new ways to improve productivity and solve the urgent need for a large amount of timber in our country. Regarding the prevention and control of forest pests, all regions have deeply summarized the experience of the masses. On this basis, the Fujian Forestry Research Institute further cultivated Beauveria bassiana and carried out experiments on the prevention and control of pine caterpillars, which were very successful, and its effect exceeded 0.1% wettable "666". Spraying pine caterpillars with a 1:50 ratio of the drug in the forest, the mortality rate reached 90% after seven days.

Second, in order to eradicate natural disasters, the Party put forward the grand march to 1.6 billion mu of desert, and a comprehensive survey of the large deserts in Northwest China has been carried out. In the past few years, we have summarized the advanced experience gained by the broad masses of people in fighting against sandstorms for many years, such as soil compaction, water pulling sand, grass fixing sand, and planting sand barriers, and other technical measures to control deserts; and carried out aerial seeding experiments in the Hexi Corridor and large areas of shifting sand in Shaanxi; at the same time, we have also studied the ecological characteristics of major sand-fixing plants and their propagation and planting techniques.

Regarding the construction of coastal saline-alkali land protection forests, the main saline-alkali land afforestation and tree planting have been selected, and efforts have been made to reduce the salt content of the soil, so the greening work is progressing very smoothly.

In terms of soil and water conservation forest construction on the Loess Plateau, Zhang Fenglin and Gao Jincai from Daquan Mountain in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, adopted measures such as horizontal ditches, horizontal steps, layering, and fish-scale pits according to the terrain and specific conditions of soil and water loss, and successfully built soil and water conservation forests, which have been promoted to all parts of the country.

In terms of afforestation in stony mountains, farmers in Qidong County, Hunan Province, adopted horizontal strip land preparation, stone hole digging, and soil filling measures to cultivate cypress, arborvitae, chinaberry, tung trees, and Chinese tallow trees on red shale mountains, with an average survival rate of more than 95%.

Third, with the rapid development of China's socialist construction, the demand for timber is increasing day by day. In order to ensure the supply of timber, the forest industry has conducted extensive research on increasing timber production and saving timber. For example, China has a wide variety of trees, and the properties of wood are different. To achieve the appropriate use of materials, we must first understand the physical and mechanical properties of various wood, the wood structure, and wood chemistry. In recent years, research on the material properties of China's main economic timber has been carried out on more than 100 tree species, which can be used as a reference for design, construction, production, and other timber-using departments. Secondly, after the timber is felled, proper drying and preservation can greatly extend the service life of the timber. Now we have researched the high-temperature kiln drying benchmark for several main domestic timbers, and promoted the simplified drying furnace and paraffin rapid drying method for timber. In terms of wood preservation, the performance of pentachlorophenol preservatives and its factory impregnation test have been carried out, and the preservative paste coating method and the hot and cold tank impregnation method have been tested, and promoted in railway sleepers, highway wooden bridges, etc. The use of dried and preserved wood can greatly extend the service life and save transportation capacity.

In order to improve the utilization rate of timber, since 1958, a lot of research has also been carried out on the comprehensive utilization of timber. At present, great progress has been made in using processing residues, bamboo, reeds, and crop stalks to manufacture various artificial boards. For fiberboard production, according to the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small, a complete set of production and equipment suitable for China has been created.

In addition, in the field of forest chemical industry, units affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Light Industry Research Institute and related factories have conducted research on the use of branches and bark from logging areas and timber skin to produce pulp, so that red and white pine bark may be widely used in the paper industry. Valuable experience has been gained in the experimental work of extracting glucose from wood chips.

The use of carbon kiln exhaust gas to produce vinegar stone provides a large amount of raw materials for the acetic acid industry. Significant achievements have also been made in research on rosin, tannin and other products in terms of improving quality, expanding output, and improving production technology and equipment.

The above points only show that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the wise leadership of the Party, China's forestry science and technology work is also making rapid progress towards the peak of world forestry science and technology.

The above situation shows that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and in the socialist system can the broad masses of the people give play to their infinite wisdom and these miracles will appear, and even greater miracles will be created in the future, which is a great encouragement to me. In the future, I will strengthen the study of political theory, study Chairman Mao's works, strive to transform myself, and under the leadership of the Party, plunge into the torrent of mass movements and contribute my knowledge to the socialist construction of our great motherland.

    林业科学技术的新阶段
    陈嵘委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我这次参加全国政协会议，连日学习了李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，在思想上、政治上都得到无穷无尽的收获，因我一向是学习林业，尤其在这方面得到启发特别深刻。我现在要发表一点感想：
    森林能调节气候，保持水土，消灭水旱风沙灾害，保证农产丰收，并且生产木材和其他多种多样的物品来供应工业原料，并满足人民生活。根据多年各方面的调查研究，每一个国家须拥有国土总面积的30％以上的森林面积才能起以上所提的改造自然和丰富物资的作用。我国国土广阔自然条件好，最适宜于各种林木生长。奈因旧时代不但忽视林业，而且进行了大量的破坏，以致到解放初期，我国森林面积仅为国土总面积的5％左右。直到解放后党特别关心林业，迅速采取各种重要措施，使林业得到了蓬勃的发展，短短十年间，已取得了辉煌的成就。林业科学研究工作同样在党的亲切关怀和正确领导下，几年来也有了很大的发展。特别在1958年、1959年大跃进形势鼓舞下，林业科学研究工作也出现了跃进的局面。我现仅就其中几个主要方面来说明新中国的林业科学技术逐渐步入世界林业科学技术的新阶段。
    第一、我国南方广大山区，对于杉木、毛竹、油茶的栽种和经营，有悠久的历史和丰富的经验，解放以来，对这几个树种进行了深入的研究，从而大大提高了这些林木的生产率。例如：八年生杉木每公顷蓄积量达二百八十六点五立方米，毛竹每公顷每度新竹产量已超过十五万斤，油茶每公顷产油达一千五百多斤，小面积油茶试验田亩产油达三百斤。1958年南方各省对速生丰产林进行了初步总结。现在全国很多地区和单位对当地主要树种正在进行速生丰产措施的试验研究，将为提高生产率解决我国迫切需要大量木材的问题开辟新途径。关于防治森林虫害，各地深入总结了群众经验，福建林业科学研究所在此基础上更进一步培养白僵菌，进行了防治松毛虫的试验，大获成功，其效果超过0.1％的可湿性“六六六”。在林内用一比五十比例的药剂喷射松毛虫，七天后死亡率达90％。
    第二、为了根除自然灾害，党提出了向十六亿亩砂漠大进军，对我国西北地区的大沙漠已进行了全面综合考察。几年来总结了广大人民多年来与沙害搏斗所得到的先进经验，如土压沙、水拉沙、种草固沙、种插沙障等等制服沙漠的技术措施；并在河西走廊及陕西大面积的流沙地区开展了飞机播种试验；同时对主要沙生植物的生态特性及其繁殖和栽种技术也进行了研究。
    关于沿海盐碱地防护林的营造，已选出主要盐碱地造林种树，并设法降低土壤含盐量，因此绿化工作进行很顺利。
    在黄土高原水土保持林营造方面，有山西阳高县大泉山张枫林、高进财两同志，根据地形和水土流失的具体情况，采用水平沟、水平阶、压条、鱼鳞坑等措施，成功地营造了水土保持林，并已向全国各地推广。
    在石质山地造林方面，有湖南祁东县农民在红色页岩山采用水平带状整地，打石开穴、填土等措施栽培侧柏、园柏、苦楝、梧桐、乌桕等，成活率平均达95％以上。
    第三、随着我国社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，木材需要量日益增加。为了保证木材供应，森林工业方面对增产木材和节约用材等方面，进行了广泛的研究。如我国树木种类繁多，木材性质各异，要达到适材适用，必须首先明了各种木材的物理力学、木材构造与木材化学。几年来对我国主要经济用材材性的研究，已做出一百多个树种，可以供设计、施工、生产等用材部门之参考。其次，木材砍伐后，加以适当干燥和防腐，可大大延长木材使用年限。现已研究出国产几种主要木材的高温炉干基准，并推广成材简易干燥炉和石腊快速干燥法。木材防腐方面已进行了五氯酚防腐剂的性能及其工厂浸注试验，试验了防腐浆膏涂抹法和冷热槽浸注法，并在铁路枕木、公路木桥等方面进行了推广。经过干燥和防腐的木材使用，可大大延长使用年限和节约运输力。
    为了提高木材利用率，自1958年起，对木材综合利用，也进行大量研究。目前，利用加工剩余物、竹子、芦苇及农作物梗杆等，制造各种人造板，已有很大的进展。对纤维板生产，根据土洋结合，大、中、小结合的方针，已经创造一整套适合我国的生产和设备。
    此外在林产化工方面，中国科学院和轻工业研究院所属单位以及有关工厂曾进行利用伐区枝桠和制材板皮生产纸浆的研究，使红白松板皮在造纸工业中有可能被广泛利用。由木屑制取葡萄糖的试验工作，已取得可贵的经验。
    利用炭窑废气生产醋石的工作，给醋酸工业提供了大量的原料。对松香栲胶等产品，在提高质量，扩大产量，改进生产工艺和设备等方面的研究，也都取得较显著的成效。
    以上几点仅仅说明建国以来，在党的英明领导下，我国的林业科学技术工作，也正日新月异地向世界林业科学技术高峰迈进。
    上述这些情况都说明只有在共产党领导下和社会主义制度里，广大群众发挥了无穷的智慧，才会出现这些奇迹，而且今后会创造出更大的奇迹，因此，对我是莫大的鼓舞。今后要加强政治理论学习，学习毛主席的著作，努力改造自己，在党的领导下，投身于群众运动的洪流中，把自己的知识贡献给我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业。
