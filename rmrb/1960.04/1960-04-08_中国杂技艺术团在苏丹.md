The first country the China Acrobatic Arts Troupe visited and performed in Africa was Sudan. On January 24, the acrobatic arts troupe held its premiere performance at the Omdurman National Theatre in Khartoum. The Omdurman National Theatre is a newly built open-air theatre that can accommodate 3,500 spectators. Two grass-green portraits of men and women hanging on both sides of the stage added to the Arab character of the theatre. Although the theatre is more than ten kilometers away from the city center and several kilometers away from Omdurman town, and there is no public transportation, there were still many spectators. Six of the ten cabinet ministers of Sudan attended. That night, the acrobatic troupe performed fourteen programs, including steel forks, tightrope walking, jar juggling, contortion, diabolo, trapeze rings, ventriloquism, and Chinese folk music. It is difficult to point out which program was particularly popular, because the venue was filled with laughter and applause from beginning to end. Some viewers were even so excited that they exclaimed "Ya, Akh," which means "Ya, brother." During the intermission and at the end of the performance, many spectators crowded backstage to pay their respects to the Chinese acrobats. Ghana's Ambassador to Sudan, Ganeki Dai, wearing a blanket-like national costume, also ran to congratulate Chinese Ambassador Wang Yutian and Qu Wu, the head of the China Acrobatic Arts Troupe, on the success of the performance, and repeatedly praised the Chinese acrobatics as "remarkable."

Chinese acrobatics attracted Sudanese audiences, and the number of viewers increased day by day. The result, as the "Sudan Voice" newspaper said, "made Khartoum's largest national theatre seem small." On the evening of January 29, all three thousand seats in the theatre were sold out, but more than two hundred spectators were still crowding at the door to buy tickets. The theatre manager had no choice but to open the side door and let them in to watch while standing. After that, audiences without seats often appeared in the theatre. None of the ministers of the Sudanese government had not seen Chinese acrobatics, and some even watched it several times. For example, Major General Talat Farid, Minister of Information and Labor, watched eleven performances, and Foreign Minister Herle watched six performances. There were even more ministers who watched two or three performances.

It so happened that these few days saw what Khartoum people called "severe cold weather." Although such "severe cold" was only equivalent to the late autumn weather in Beijing, just wearing a thin woolen vest was enough, but for Sudanese audiences who were accustomed to summer all year round, it was indeed considered "severe cold." Despite the weather, the audiences, some wearing ear-covering velvet hats, some wearing scarves, and some wrapped in blankets, continued to watch until the end of the show late at night before leaving. The theatre manager, Yusuf, happily told us that the acrobatic troupe had created the highest attendance rate in the national theatre. A photographer from the Film Department of the Ministry of Information and Labor told me: The acrobatic troupe has made the best expression of Chinese art. Whether you speak Arabic, English, or French, you can appreciate your art without any explanation.

On January 31, General Abbud, Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and Prime Minister of the Republic of Sudan, accompanied by the Minister of Information and Labor, the Minister of Interior, and the Minister of Education, also came to the National Theatre to watch Chinese acrobatics. When Chairman Abbud received the leaders of the acrobatic troupe on February 7, his first sentence was: Your performance is so good, "I have never seen such a good performance."

The warm welcome of the Sudanese audience to the acrobatic troupe was also reflected in the Sudanese newspapers and periodicals. Almost all Sudanese newspapers and magazines published articles, features, or photos introducing Chinese acrobatics, and several major daily newspapers, "Al-Rai al-Aam," "Today's News," "Al-Sudan al-Jadid," and "Al-Saraha," also published special issues. It is impossible to introduce these many features and articles in a short space, and it is even difficult to repeat the titles of the newspapers and periodicals. For example, the title of an article in "Today's News" introducing Chinese acrobatics was "The Acrobatic Art of Great China Shocked People," and "Al Akhbar" weekly said, "The Acrobatic Art of People's China Shook the Law of Gravity." "Today's News" said that the development of Chinese acrobatic art is because the state attaches special importance to culture and art under the people's regime, and gives it infinite care. "Al-Rai al-Aam" said that although Chinese acrobatic art has a history of more than a thousand years, it has only been fully developed since the birth of New China. "Al-Saraha," "Al-Sudan al-Jadid," and "Al-Nil" all expressed their hope to strengthen the cultural relations between China and Sudan; because this is conducive to the development of the cultural and artistic undertakings of Sudan.

Sudanese newspapers also published letters from readers from all over the country. People praised the acrobatic troupe's visit and performance, thanked the acrobatic troupe for bringing the friendship of the Chinese people, and some suggested that China send other art troupes to Sudan in the future, and some requested to strengthen cultural exchanges between the two countries. The newspaper also published a speech by the Sudanese Minister of Health, Muhammad Ali. He said that the visit and performance of the China Acrobatic Arts Troupe "will have a profound impact on the physical and mental health of the residents of the three towns in the capital (Khartoum City including Khartoum Town, Omdurman Town, and North Khartoum Town), especially children, because relaxed entertainment is the best treatment for human physical and psychological illnesses, especially in modern times when human physiology and nerve activity are so frequent due to the hustle and bustle of life that it has reached a level that the human body cannot bear."

In early and mid-February, the acrobatic troupe left Khartoum twice to perform in four cities, and received a warmer welcome than the audience in Khartoum; and its performance in El Obeid, a city in western Sudan known as the "bride in the desert," became the peak of its warm welcome by the audience in Sudan. At a performance by the acrobatic troupe in Atbara in the north, the audience reached 5,000 people, which we thought was not a small number. But at the premiere in El Obeid, the audience exceeded 6,000, and the next day's performance exceeded 10,000, while the total population of the city was only over 70,000. When the acrobatic troupe performed, the two cinemas here temporarily stopped operating because there was no audience. Although the reception committee in El Obeid tried to collect a large number of chairs from various agencies, schools, and clubs; in the first performance, many spectators watched the performance while standing, and in the second performance, most of the spectators were standing. After a performance of 10,000 people watching acrobatics, the entire audience cheered and applauded in unison, and hundreds of spectators rushed to the stage, surrounding the stage, shaking hands and saying hello, making the actors very busy. Brigadier General Hassan Zallib, Commander of the Central Military Region of Sudan and Military Governor of Kordofan Province, presented gifts to the acrobatic troupe on stage. At the final parting, the students of El Obeid Girls' Middle School and our actresses were reluctant to part with each other, and everyone shed tears. On the way back to Khartoum by train from El Obeid, at the request of the reception committee in Kosti, the acrobatic troupe got off the train and performed a performance for 6,000 spectators (one-fifth of the city's population); they got on the train overnight and arrived in Khartoum at midnight the next day.

The acrobatic troupe decided to leave Sudan in batches from February 18, but on the evening of the 17th, at the suggestion of our host, the Ministry of Information and Labor, a farewell performance was held at the Omdurman National Theatre, and naturally the theatre was full again. After the performance, Minister of Information and Labor Talat Farid presented gifts to all the actors on behalf of Abbud, Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Sudanese Armed Forces, and gave a speech thanking the China Acrobatic Arts Troupe for donating all its income in Sudan to the Ministry of Information and Labor for the development of cultural undertakings.

During the month that the China Acrobatic Arts Troupe stayed in Sudan, it performed more than a dozen performances in five cities. In contact with the Sudanese people, we deeply felt their friendship towards the Chinese people. For example, when the members of the acrobatic troupe went to the Omdurman town market one time, they were surrounded by Sudanese people as soon as they appeared on the street, and people cheered enthusiastically "Chini" (China) and "Yaish - Chini" (Long live China). When we visited Khartoum University, technical schools, and other places, we were always warmly welcomed and surrounded by the Sudanese people. Yashin, a small carpenter at the Omdurman National Theatre, saw that many wooden boxes of the acrobatic troupe were damaged after a long journey, so he secretly repaired them for us one by one. After we found out, we wanted to give him a reward to express our gratitude, but he insisted on refusing to accept it. One day, an unknown Sudanese man came to the hotel and gave several Sudanese ivory carvings to one of our actors, and turned around and left. We didn't even have time to thank him. Our young actor Zeng Guoxing and his comrades went to the store, and a female customer who was shopping there gave him a toy. These friendly expressions are unforgettable for us. We left Sudan on the morning of February 18, but as Qu Wu, the head of the acrobatic troupe, said at the farewell performance, "We not only brought Chinese acrobatic art to the Sudanese audience, but we also brought the friendship of the Chinese people to the Sudanese people; similarly, we will also bring the friendship of the Sudanese people back to China."

    中国杂技艺术团在苏丹
    李启
    中国杂技艺术团在非洲访问演出的头一个国家是苏丹。1月24日，杂技艺术团在喀土穆的恩图曼国家剧院举行首次演出。恩图曼国家剧院是一个建成不久的露天剧场，可以容纳三千五百名观众。舞台两侧悬挂的两幅草绿色男女人头像，增加了这个剧场的阿拉伯色彩。虽然剧场离市中心区足有十多公里，离恩图曼镇也有好几公里，又没有公共汽车，但观众还是很多。苏丹的十位内阁部长中到了六位。这天晚上，杂技团演出了钢叉、走钢丝、耍坛子、柔术、抖空竹、吊环、口技、中国民族音乐等十四个节目。要想指出哪一个节目特别受欢迎是一件难事，因为自始至终，场内都充满了欢笑声和掌声。有的观众甚至兴奋得高声赞叹“呀，阿赫”，意思就是“呀，兄弟”。演出休息和结束的时候，好些观众拥到后台，向中国的杂技演员们表示敬意。穿着毛毯一样的民族服装的加纳驻苏丹大使加奈其·戴也跑来向中国大使王雨田和中国杂技艺术团长屈武祝贺演出的成功，并连声称赞中国杂技艺术“了不起”。
    中国杂技吸引着苏丹观众，看的人一天比一天多起来。结果正如“苏丹之声报”所说的“使得喀土穆最大的国家剧场都嫌小了。”1月29日晚上，剧场的三千几百个座位都已卖光，但门口还挤着两百多观众要买票。剧院经理无可奈何，只好打开旁门让他们进来站着看。以后剧院里就经常出现这种没有座位的观众。苏丹政府各部的部长没有一个人没有看过中国杂技的，有的还连看几次。如宣传和劳工部部长塔拉特·法里德少将一共看了十一场，外交部长赫尔一共看了六场，至于看过两三场的部长们就更多了。
    恰好这几天出现了喀土穆人所谓的“严寒的天气”。虽然这样的“严寒”不过相当于北京的深秋天气，只要穿上一件薄毛背心就很够了，但对于习惯了一年四季都是盛夏的苏丹观众来说，的确要算“严寒”了。尽管天气如此，观众们有的戴上遮耳的绒帽，有的围上围巾，有的裹着毯子，仍一直看到深夜终场才走。剧场经理优素福很高兴地告诉我们，杂技团创造了国家剧场最高的上座率。宣传和劳工部电影处的一位摄影师对我说：杂技团为中国的艺术作了最好的表达，不论是讲阿拉伯语的，人讲英语或是法语的人，不需要任何解释和说明，都能够欣赏你们的艺术。
    1月31日，苏丹共和国武装部队最高委员会主席兼总理阿布德将军，也由宣传和劳工部部长、内政部长和教育部长等陪同来到国家剧院观看中国杂技。2月7日阿布德主席接见杂技团领导人的时候，头一句话就是：你们的演出太好了，“我从来没有看到过这样好的表演。”
    苏丹观众对杂技团的热烈欢迎，在苏丹的报刊上也得到反映。几乎所有的苏丹报纸杂志都发表了评介中国杂技的文章、特写或照片，几家主要的日报，“舆论报”、“今日报”、
  “新苏丹报”、“直言报”还出了专刊。要想在短短的篇幅中介绍这许多特写和文章是不可能的，甚至仅仅重复一下报刊的标题也是困难的。例如“今日报”的一篇评介中国杂技的文章的标题是“伟大中国的杂技艺术震惊了人们”，“消息”周刊说，“人民中国的杂技艺术动摇了地心引力定律。”“今日报”说，中国杂技艺术的发展是因为在人民政权下国家特别重视文化艺术，给予它无限关怀。“舆论报”说中国杂技艺术虽然有一千多年的历史，但只是在新中国诞生以后才得到充分发展。“直言报”、“新苏丹报”和“尼罗河报”都表示希望加强中国和苏丹两国之间的文化关系；因为这是有利于苏丹文化艺术事业的发展的。
    苏丹的报纸还登载了各地的读者来信。人们赞扬杂技团的访问演出，感谢杂技团带来了中国人民的友谊，有的还建议中国以后再派其他艺术团体来苏丹，有的要求加强两国的文化交流。报纸还刊登了苏丹卫生部长穆罕默德·阿里的谈话。他说，中国杂技艺术团的访问演出“将对首都三镇（喀土穆市包括喀土穆镇、恩图曼镇和北喀土穆镇）居民特别是儿童的身心健康产生深刻的影响，因为轻松的文娱是对人类生理和心理的病痛的最好的治疗方法，特别是在现代人类的生理和神经活动由于生活的奔波如此频繁，以致达到了人体难以承受的程度”。
    2月初旬和中旬，杂技团曾两次离喀土穆到四个城市去演出，受到比喀土穆观众更为热烈的欢迎；而它在苏丹西部的艾尔·阿卑德市——被称为“沙漠里的新娘”这个城市的演出，更成为它在苏丹受到观众热烈欢迎的顶峰。杂技团在北部的阿特巴拉市演出的一场，观众达到五千人，我们认为这数字已经不小。但在艾尔·阿卑德的初次演出，观众就超过了六千，第二天演出，观众超过了一万，而这个城市的人口总共才不过七万多。杂技团演出时，这里的两家电影院竟因为没有观众而暂时停止了营业。虽然艾尔·阿卑德市的接待委员会设法从各机关、学校和俱乐部调集了大批椅子；但在头一场就有很多观众站着看演出，第二场更有大多数观众是站着的。万人看杂技的一场演出结束后，全场齐声欢呼鼓掌，几百名观众拥向舞台，把舞台团团包围起来了，又是握手又是问好，给演员们忙得不可开交。苏丹中部军区司令兼科多凡省军事长官哈桑·扎利布准将上台向杂技团赠送了礼品。在最后分手的时候，艾尔·阿卑德市女中的学生和我们的女演员难舍难分，大家都流泪了。在从艾尔·阿卑德乘火车回喀土穆的途中，经科斯提市的接待委员会的要求，杂技团下火车为六千观众（占该市人口的五分之一）演出了一场；连夜上车，在第二天半夜才到达喀土穆。
    杂技团决定从2月18日起分批离开苏丹，但17日晚间，由于我们的主人——宣传和劳工部的建议，在恩图曼国家剧院举行告别演出，自然剧场又是满座。演出结束后，宣传和劳工部长塔拉特·法里德将军代表苏丹武装部队最高委员会主席阿布德向全体演员赠送礼品，并发表讲话感谢中国杂技艺术团把它在苏丹的全部收入捐赠给宣传和劳工部发展文化事业。
    中国杂技艺术团在苏丹逗留的一个月当中，在五个城市演出了十几场。在同苏丹人民的接触中，我们深深地感受到他们对中国人民的友谊。比如杂技团的团员有一次去逛恩图曼镇市场、刚一出现街头，就被苏丹人围起来了，人们热烈欢呼“秦尼”（中国）和“雅伊喜——秦尼”（中国万岁）。当我们参观喀土穆大学、技术学校和其他地方时，也总是受到苏丹人的热烈欢迎和包围。恩图曼国家剧场的小木工亚申看到杂技团的许多木箱经过长途载运损坏了，就偷偷地替我们一个又一个修好。我们发现后要给他报酬表示谢意，他却坚持拒绝不肯收下。有一天，一位不知名的苏丹人找到旅馆来，把几件苏丹的象牙雕刻送给我们的一位演员，转身就走了。我们连道谢也没来得及。我们的小演员曾国兴和同志们上商店去，一位正在那里买东西的女顾客送给他一件玩具。这些友好的表示都是我们不能忘记的。我们在2月18日早晨离开了苏丹，但正如杂技团屈武团长在告别演出时所说的“我们不仅给苏丹的观众带来了中国的杂技艺术，我们也给苏丹人民带来了中国人民的友谊；同样地，我们也将把苏丹人民的友谊带回中国去”。
