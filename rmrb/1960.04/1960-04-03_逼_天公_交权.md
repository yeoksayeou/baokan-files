Forcing "Heavenly Father" to Relinquish Power
Ning Ding

"When the Drought Demon arrives, we kneel and surrender; the grains don't return home, and people starve."

"When the Drought Demon arrives, we wave our arms and resist; disaster is unseen, and the granaries are full of grain."

This is a portrayal of two attitudes and two results regarding drought.

The history of mankind is primarily a history of struggle against "Heavenly Father." In this struggle, the positions of man and "Heavenly Father" are constantly developing and changing.

In the old society, the power of the masses could not be fully realized, and "Heavenly Father" occupied a dominant position. People were subject to the control of "Heaven," i.e., so-called "accepting fate." When there was drought, they knelt and prayed for rain; when there was flooding, they burned incense and prayed to the gods. Even so, "Heavenly Father" always mercilessly tormented the people. Just as Su Shi described in "Record of the Joyful Rain Pavilion": "If it doesn't rain for five days, there will be no wheat... if it doesn't rain for ten days, there will be no grain; without wheat or grain, the year will surely be a famine." Coupled with the exploitation and oppression of the ruling class, the working people lived in extreme poverty. Even individual farmers after liberation, because they were isolated and weak, still had to let "Old Man Heaven" run the house. "Man plants crops, Heaven determines the yield; harvest depends on Heaven, not man," was their confession of submission to "Heavenly Father." At that time, although the peasants were the masters of the country politically, they were still poor and backward economically.

Now, it is the era for "Heavenly Father" to relinquish power. The Chinese people, armed with the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, will make high mountains bow their heads, rivers give way, control "Heavenly Father," and become the masters of nature. "Everything is done by man," and "Man can conquer nature" is a truth that many facts have proven. The glorious victory of the people of Leinan County, Guangdong, in their fight against drought (see "People's Daily," March 9th), is ironclad proof of this. From 1958 to 1959, there was no thorough rain in this county for sixteen consecutive months, and the seedlings died of drought three or five times, but they did not lose heart: when they died of drought, they planted again; when they died of drought again, they planted again... This is in such stark contrast to the past of "hoping for clouds and rainbows in a great drought!" In 1959, the crops there not only did not decrease in production, but increased by more than 10% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The commune members laughed and said, "Let it be drought! Even if it's drought for another year, we will still have food to eat." The laughter of the people of Leinan is in such stark contrast to Su Shi's lament!

The principles of historical materialism tell us that among the social productive forces, man is the most decisive factor, and labor tools and objects are created and used by man. Although the objective determines the subjective, the subjective can act on the objective. People can discover and understand natural laws, master them, and use them to benefit society, thereby conquering and controlling them. Things are done by man, and conditions can be changed. Under our superior socialist system, as long as we give full play to man's subjective initiative, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. Our 600 million heroic people are proceeding from this point of view, and in the face of the severe spring drought, with the spirit of "If Heaven doesn't rain, man will make rain, and harvest depends on man, not Heaven," they have declared war on "Heavenly Father" and are fighting the Drought Demon. As a result, good news is constantly being reported, and final victory is undoubtedly certain.

Currently, the Drought Demon is still opposing the people. The comrades who have made meritorious contributions by slaying the "Demon" on the battlefield are continuing their efforts, advancing victoriously, resolutely fighting the Drought Demon, and resolutely forcing "Heavenly Father" to relinquish power. In the face of the fearless heroic spirit of the Chinese people, "Heavenly Father" has no choice but to relinquish power.

    逼“天公”交权
    宁丁
    “来了旱魔王，屈膝即投降；颗粒不归家，人们饿断肠。”
    “来了旱魔王，挥臂就抵抗；有灾不见灾，五谷堆满仓。”
    这是对于干旱的两种态度、两种结果的写照。
    人类的历史，首先是与“天公”斗争的历史。在这一斗争中，人与“天公”的地位，是不断发展变化的。
    在旧社会，人民群众的力量不可能充分发挥，“天公”占居统治地位；人们受着“天”的支配，即所谓“听天由命”。旱了，跪拜祈雨；涝了，烧香求神。尽管如此，“天公”总是无情地折磨着人们。正如苏轼在“喜雨亭记”中描述的那样：“五日不雨则无麦，……十日不雨则无禾，无麦无禾，岁且荐饥。”再加上统治阶级的剥削、压迫，劳动人民更是过着贫困至极的生活。就是解放以后的个体农民，因为形单影孤，一木力微，也还得叫“老天爷”当家。“人种庄稼天定产，丰收由天不由人”，正是他们屈服于“天公”的表白。那时，农民虽然在政治上当了国家的主人，但在经济上还是贫穷落后的。
    如今，已是“天公”交权的时代了。掌握了总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的中国人民，要高山低头，要河水让路，要支配“天公”，要做大自然的主宰。“事在人为”，“人定胜天”，已是许多事实所证明的一条真理。广东雷南人民抗旱斗争的辉煌胜利（见3月9日“人民日报”），就是其中的一个铁证。这县在1958年至1959年，连续十六个月没有下过透雨，禾苗旱死三、五次，但他们没有灰心：旱死了，种上；又旱死了，再种上……。这和过去的“大旱望云霓”，是多么鲜明的对照啊！1959年，他们那里的庄稼，不但没有减产，反而比大跃进的1958年增产一成多。社员们笑道：“叫它旱吧！再旱一年，我们还有吃的。”雷南人民的笑声，与苏轼的那种哀叹，又是多么鲜明的对照啊！
    历史唯物主义的原理告诉我们：社会生产力中，人是最有决定性的因素，劳动工具和劳动对象都是为人所创造和使用的。客观虽然决定主观，但主观却能反作用于客观。人们能够发现和认识自然法则，掌握它们，利用它们来为社会谋福利，从而征服它们，控制它们。事情在人办，条件能改变。在我们优越的社会主义制度下，只要充分发挥人的主观能动作用，没有什么困难不能克服的。我国六亿英雄的人民，正是从这种观点出发，在严重的春旱面前，以“天不下雨人下雨，丰收由人不由天”的气概，向“天公”宣战，与旱魔搏斗。结果捷报频传，最后胜利是肯定无疑的。
    目前，旱魔仍在与人们作对。在战场上斩“魔”立功的同志，正在再接再厉，乘胜前进，坚决与旱魔搏斗，坚决逼“天公”交权。在我国人民无畏的英雄气概面前，“天公”不交权是不行的。
