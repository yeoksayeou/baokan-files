    One Heart From Top to Bottom, Sharing Sweet and Bitter
    By our reporter Huang Changlu
    A comrade from another place came to the Kunming Dali Chemical Plant, preparing to contact the factory director about something. He had just reached the entrance when he saw a group of people unloading salt from a truck, and asked, "Where is your factory director?" Someone pointed to an old man next to him, whose clothes were patched upon patched, and said, "He's right here!" The comrade didn't believe it. It wasn't until the old factory director put down his work and came over to greet him that he exclaimed in surprise, "Ah! So you're the factory director."
    Many comrades from outside have encountered similar situations. You won't find the cadres in this factory's office; to find them, you have to go down to the workshops, to the most difficult places. In this factory, you can also see that when a worker is sick, the branch secretary and the factory director personally deliver medicine and food to the patient's bedside, bringing hot water and water for washing feet. The weather in Kunming is warm during the day and cool at night. In order to prevent the workers from catching cold at night, the branch secretary and the factory director, after a day of hard work, still get up in the middle of the night to check the dormitories one by one, bed by bed, and cover the workers with quilts. In this factory, the workers' ages vary greatly, from old workers in their fifties to young apprentices who are only thirteen years old, but everyone is united like a family. Strangers find it difficult to tell who is a cadre and who is a worker. The workers also love to boast about this: "No cadres in the office, find the leaders in the difficult places."
    This kind of flesh-and-blood relationship between cadres and workers not only deeply moves the workers, but also becomes a huge force driving the factory's production to continuously leap forward. Last year, the factory's total output value increased by more than threefold compared to 1958. The higher authorities asked them to increase it by another threefold this year, but the workers are determined to complete it in five months, striving to increase this year's output value tenfold compared to last year. This small factory with fewer than two hundred people produced products worth more than 7 million yuan for the country last year, and turned over a net profit of 3.4 million yuan to the state, an average of 23,000 yuan of wealth created for the country per person. This small factory, which started from a dilapidated lead pool, used its own home-grown methods to manufacture high-grade chemical products such as hydrofluoric acid, which only a few chemical plants in the country can produce. This small factory, which was not very noticeable in the past, became a red banner unit in Kunming City and the national chemical system in 1959.
    The Dali Chemical Plant used to be a relatively backward unit, and the output value it produced in the past was not enough to pay wages, so it relied on bank loans every month to maintain operations. In the summer of 1958, the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party successively sent five cadres of worker origin and veterans transferred from the army to the factory to take on leadership positions. These comrades understood that the factory's production tasks had to be completed by relying on the broad masses of workers, and to rely on them, they first had to become one with them, consult with them on everything, understand their thoughts, and care about their difficulties. Old factory director Yuan Zhenfang, who came from a car driving background, and branch secretary Zhao Bingwen, who had been wounded three times in the army and still had a bullet in his body that had not been removed, took the lead in going down to the workshops to participate in labor, from driving and pulling coal to moving glass bottles and cleaning toilets. No matter how big or small the task, they did everything, especially where the task was the most arduous and the most difficult, they would appear there.
    The factory had successfully trial-produced hydrofluoric acid in 1953, but it had not been mass-produced. This was because the corrosive power of this acid was strong and extremely toxic. If even a little of the smoke it emitted touched the hand, the skin would immediately turn black and rot. Therefore, everyone had great concerns about manufacturing this product, saying that "the tiger's backside cannot be touched." However, the factory considered that hydrofluoric acid was a raw material urgently needed by some factories in Kunming City, which in the past relied entirely on imports. Not only was the price too expensive and transportation inconvenient, but also the quality was very low and could not meet the needs of users. Therefore, it was determined to touch the tiger's backside. Everyone had concerns, so old factory director Yuan Zhenfang and deputy factory director Fu Baoquan took the lead with several party members. When the masses saw this, they were moved and said, "The factory director is almost fifty years old, and he is not afraid, what are we afraid of?" They all participated in the manufacture of hydrofluoric acid. As a result, it was mass-produced last year, and the quality far exceeded that of imported goods, meeting the needs of Kunming City's industry.
    With the development of production, the factory's transportation volume also increased greatly, with more than 1,000 tons of materials coming in and out every month. However, the factory not only did not have a car, but even a horse-drawn cart. Transportation became the lifeline of the entire factory. For transportation, old factory director Yuan Zhenfang often went to the Kunming Smelter across the street to borrow a car after a day of intense work, acting as both a driver and a loader, rushing to transport goods all night, and still working as usual the next day. For transportation, the branch secretary and the factory director often led cadres to load and unload goods, so that vehicles from outside were willing to come and support the factory. On the afternoon of the October Revolution Day last year, a notice was suddenly received that a large amount of coal had been transported to the railway station a few kilometers away from the factory. The old factory director thought that according to the regulations of the railway department, goods left at the railway station overnight would be fined. Thinking of this, he jumped into the car to transport coal, and many cadres and workers also jumped into the car with him.
    Under the leadership of the leading cadres, all eighteen cadres in the factory stepped out of the office and went deep into the front line of production. Cadres' participation in labor initially was twice a week, and later developed into a regular practice. Except for necessary meetings, cadres spent all their time in the workshops, and even cadres had to ask the workers for leave before holding meetings. At the beginning, a few cadres doubted: "If we continue to do this, we won't be able to write documents or file reports. Will it affect our work?" The branch firmly answered them: "Cadres go down to the workshops not only to labor, but also to discover and solve problems in a timely manner through production, and to learn to follow the mass line." Sure enough, many things that could not be done well in the office in the past were done well after the cadres went deep into production and mobilized the masses. The factory had four generators, three of which broke down in 1957, which greatly affected production. The workers were anxious to repair them, but they lacked some materials that needed to be resolved by the leaders. In the past, the cadres sat in the office to hold meetings and discussions, which lasted for half a day, making things more and more complicated, and the three generators remained idle. The old factory director went deep into the workshop to discuss with the workers and found that the problem was not that difficult and complicated. It was just that they lacked some copper wire and carbon brushes. He immediately rode his bicycle to the city to buy these materials and quickly repaired the three generators. The workers said, "If the factory director hadn't come down, this problem would not have been solved for another two years."
    The cadres lived with the workers all day long, and they also had the clearest understanding of the workers' thoughts, difficulties, and hardships. They developed deep feelings for the workers and cultivated a good style of caring for and cherishing the masses at all times. Female apprentice Liang Huilan was about to have her first child and was very worried. Her home was hundreds of kilometers away in Xiangyun County, and her husband was a car driver who was often away. She had no relatives or friends in Kunming. She carried a heavy burden in her mind about this matter. She had no energy for production and planned to take a long vacation home after the child was born. However, the cadres had learned about her difficulties from the masses and arranged everything properly for her. The branch secretary personally went to the city to find her a house, and asked a family member of an old worker in the factory to be her nanny. Even the child's clothes were sewn for her by the female workers in the factory. After the child was born, the branch secretary and the factory director also bought brown sugar, eggs, noodles, etc. to visit her. She said gratefully, "Even if my husband was here, he couldn't take care of me so well. The factory is better than my home." Before her maternity leave was over, she happily brought her child to the factory.
    The cadres loved and cared for the workers so much that the workers regarded the cadres as their confidants. Sometimes, when the branch secretary and the factory director worked late into the night, the workers would automatically bring them steamed buns and milk. They didn't eat it, but wanted to leave it for the workers. The workers earnestly persuaded them, "You are older and carry a heavier burden than us. Your health is the happiness of the whole factory!" Once, it was snowing heavily, and all the workers in the factory braved the snow to transport lime back from Dianchi Lake. Secretary Zhao insisted on going with everyone despite being ill. Looking at his gray hair, looking at his thin body that had been wounded three times, thinking that he was now taking medicine three times a day to support his work, everyone took off the bamboo hats they were wearing and gave them to him: "Secretary, put it on! You are sick." "No! You put it on, don't get sick, we all rely on you for production!" Secretary Zhao gave the bamboo hat back to the workers. Pushing back and forth like this, everyone's hearts were warm, forgetting the wind and snow in the sky.
    When more than a hundred hearts are closely linked together, beating for a common goal, what a great power can be generated and how many touching miracles can be created! In the same factory, in the past, cadres were cadres and workers were workers. Workers called the cadres the "visiting group." Now, the entire factory is truly united as one. The workers said, "Secretary Zhao is better than my own parents!" "The old factory director is so old, but he still works from morning till night. We are young and we can't put in more effort!" The former king of absenteeism is now the secretary of the Youth League branch. The workers who used to be uneasy about production and wanted to go home have now become advanced producers. When difficulties arose in the factory, no one in the entire factory, men and women, old and young, could close their eyes at night. When the task was tight, the branch secretary and the factory director ordered the workers to rest, but no one was willing to leave the workshop. With the same workers and equipment, the output value produced in one day is now equal to that produced in one year in the past.
    When I visited this factory, I recalled that Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his political report at the Eighth National Congress: "The important signs of a good party member and a good leader are that he is familiar with the people's living and working conditions, cares about the people's pain, and understands the people's hearts; he adheres to the style of hard work and thrift, shares weal and woe with the people, can accept the criticism and supervision of the people, and does not put on any airs in front of the people; he consults with the masses when he has something to do, and the masses are willing to talk to him when they have something to say. As long as our party is composed of such party members, we will always have endless and invincible strength." The Dali Chemical Plant's leading cadres going deep into the grassroots has brought about a huge change in the face of the entire factory, which is the most vivid example. (Attached photo)

    上下一心  同甘共苦
    本报记者　黄昌禄
    一个从外地来到昆明大利化工厂的同志，准备找厂长接洽一件事情。他刚走到门口，看见有一群人从汽车上卸盐巴，便问：“你们厂长在哪里？”有人指着旁边一个衣服上补丁叠补丁的老头说：“就在这里！”那个同志不相信。一直等到老厂长放下活计走过来招呼他，他才惊讶地说：“呵！原来你就是厂长。”
    许多外来的同志都碰到类似的事情。你到这个厂的办公室里，是找不到干部的，要找他们，得下车间，到最艰苦的地方去找。在这个厂里，你还可以看到，当工人生病的时候，支部书记和厂长亲自把药和饭菜送到病人床前去，给病人送开水、打洗脚水。昆明的天气昼暖夜凉，为了不让工人夜里着凉，支部书记和厂长在劳累了一天之后，半夜还要起来一个宿舍一个宿舍、一张床一张床地去查看，给工人盖被子。在这个厂里，职工年龄相差很大，老的到五十几，最小的徒工才十三岁，但大家亲密团结像一家人，陌生人来，很难分辨谁是干部，谁是工人。工人们也爱夸耀这点：“办公室里无干部，艰苦地方找领导”。
    干部和工人的这种血肉关系不但使职工深受感动，而且成为推动厂里生产不断跃进的巨大力量。这个厂去年的生产总值已比1958年增长了三倍多，上级要求他们今年再比去年增加三倍，工人们却决心五个月完成它，争取今年产值比去年翻十番。就是这个不满两百人的小厂，去年却为国家生产出了价值七百多万元的产品，上交给国家的纯利润达三百四十万元，平均每人为国家创造了二万三千元财富。就是这个由一个烂铅池起家的小厂，用自己摸索出来的土办法制造出了在全国只有少数化工厂能生产的氢氟酸等高级化工产品。就是这家过去很不被人注意的小厂，在1959年度成为昆明市和全国化工系统的红旗单位。
    大利化工厂原来是一个生产比较落后的单位，过去生产出来的产值还不够发工资，月月靠银行贷款维持。1958年夏天，中共昆明市委先后派了五个工人出身和部队转业的干部到这个厂来担任领导工作。这些同志懂得，在工厂里生产任务是要依靠广大工人群众去完成的，要依靠他们，首先要同他们打成一片，事事同他们商量，了解他们的心思，关心他们的疾苦。汽车司机出身的老厂长袁贞芳和在部队上曾经负过三次伤、现在身上还有一颗子弹没有取出来的支部书记赵炳文，首先带头下车间参加劳动，从开车、拉煤到搬玻璃瓶、打扫厕所，事无大小，样样都干，特别是那里的任务最艰巨，那里最困难，他们就出现在那里。
    厂里在1953年就试制成功氢氟酸了，但一直没有大量生产。因为这种酸的腐蚀力量强，性极毒，只要它冒出的烟子沾一点在手上，皮肤就会立刻发黑腐烂。因此大家对制造这种产品的顾虑很大，说是“老虎屁股摸不得”。但厂里考虑到氢氟酸是昆明市某些工厂急需的原料，过去完全靠进口，不但价钱太贵，运输不便，而且质量很低，不能满足用户的需要，于是下决心去摸摸老虎屁股。大家有顾虑，老厂长袁贞芳和副厂长傅宝全带着几个党员首先去做，群众看了感动地说：“厂长快五十岁的人了，他都不怕，我们还怕啥？”纷纷参加了氢氟酸的制造。结果在去年就大量投入生产，质量远远超过了进口货，满足了昆明市工业的需要。
    随着生产的发展，厂里的运输量也大大增加，每月进出的物资达一千多吨，但厂里不但没有汽车，甚至连一辆马车也没有。运输，成了全厂的生命线。为了运输，老厂长袁贞芳经常在紧张地工作了一天之后，夜里便到对面的昆明冶炼厂去借来一辆汽车，自己当司机，又当装卸工，抢运一个通宵，第二天还是照样工作。为了运输，支部书记和厂长经常带着干部去装卸货物，使外面来的车辆都愿意来支援这个厂。去年十月革命节那天下午，忽然接到通知，有大批煤运到了距厂几公里外的火车站，老厂长一想，按照铁路部门的规定，货物在火车站上过了夜是要罚款的。想到这里，他便第一个跳上了汽车去运煤，好些干部和工人也跟着他跳上了汽车。
    在领导干部的带动下，全厂十八个干部都走出办公室，深入生产第一线。干部参加劳动最初是一周两次，后来发展成为经常化，除了开必要的会以外，干部全部时间都在车间，甚至干部开会也要先向工人请个假。开初有少数干部怀疑：“这样搞下去，文件写不出来，报告打不上去，是不是会影响业务工作？”支部坚定地回答他们：“干部下车间，不仅仅是劳动，而且要通过生产及时发现问题解决问题，学会走群众路线。”果然，许多过去在办公室里办不好的事情，在干部深入生产和发动群众以后都办好了。厂里有四部发电机，1957年坏了三部，对生产影响很大，工人们都急着把它修好，但是缺一些材料需要领导解决。过去，干部们都坐在办公室里开会讨论，一开就是半天，把事情越说越复杂，三部发电机一直躺着不动。老厂长深入车间同工人一商量，原来问题并不那么困难和复杂，只不过缺一些铜线和炭刷，他马上骑着自行车到城内去把这些材料买了回来，很快就把三部发电机修好了。工人说：“厂长不下来，这个问题再拖两年也解决不了。”
    干部成天和工人生活在一起，对工人的思想、困难和疾苦也了解最清楚，对工人群众产生了深厚的感情，养成了时时刻刻关心和爱护群众的好作风。女徒工梁慧兰快生第一个小孩子，心里很发愁。她的家远在数百公里外的祥云县，丈夫是个汽车司机，经常在外边跑，在昆明无亲无友，为此事她思想上背了个大包袱，生产没有劲，打算等孩子一生，就请长假回家去。哪知干部已从群众中了解清楚了她的困难，诸事帮她安排得妥妥贴贴。支部书记亲自到城里给她找了一间房子，请厂里一个老工人的家属为她作保姆，甚至连小孩的衣裤也请厂里的女工帮她缝好了。生了孩子后，支部书记和厂长还买了红糖、鸡蛋、面条等去看她，她感激地说：“就是我的丈夫在这里，也照顾不了这样周到，厂里比我的家还好。”产假还没有满，她就高高兴兴抱着孩子到厂里来了。
    干部对工人这么爱护备至，工人也把干部当作自己的知心人。有时，支部书记和厂长工作到深夜了，工人们就自动地给他们送来馒头和牛奶。他们不吃，要留给工人吃。工人苦苦地劝他们说：“你们的岁数大，挑的担子比我们重，你们的身体好了，就是全厂的幸福！”有一次，天空下着大雪，全厂职工冒着雪到滇池边去运回石灰，赵书记生着病也坚持同大家一道去。大家望着他那一头白发，看着他那负过三次伤的瘦弱身体，想着他现在每天吃三次药支持着工作，都把自己头上戴的篾帽取下来给他戴：“书记，戴上吧！你身体有病。”“不！你们戴上，不要冻病了，生产都靠你们！”书记又把篾帽给工人戴上。这样推来推去，大家的心都暖哄哄地，忘记了头上漫天的风雪。
    当一百多颗心紧紧地联结在一起，为着一个共同的目标而跳动时，可以产生多么伟大的力量，创造出多少动人的奇迹呵！同样在这个厂里，过去干部是干部，工人是工人，工人叫干部作“参观团”；现在，全厂上下真正扭成了一股绳，工人说：“赵书记比我的亲爹妈还好！”“老厂长年纪这样大了，还一天干到晚，我们年轻还不能多出些力！”过去的旷工大王，现在成了团支部书记。过去生产不安心想回家的工人，现在变成了先进生产者。厂里出现了困难，全厂男女老少没有哪个人晚上合得拢眼，任务紧张时，支部书记和厂长下命令叫工人休息，也没有人肯离开车间。同样是这些工人和设备，现在生产一天的产值就等于过去生产一年。
    在访问这个工厂的时候，我回忆起刘少奇同志在八大的政治报告中这样说过：“一个好党员、一个好领导者的重要标志，在于他熟悉人民的生活状况和劳动状况，关心人民的痛痒，懂得人民的心；他坚持艰苦朴素的作风，同人民同甘苦共患难，能够接受人民的批评监督，不在人民面前摆任何架子；他有事找群众商量，群众有话也愿意同他说。只要我们的党是由这样的党员组成的，我们就永远有无穷无尽的、不可征服的力量。”大利化工厂领导干部深入基层使得全厂面貌发生巨大变化，就是一个最生动的例证。（附图片）
