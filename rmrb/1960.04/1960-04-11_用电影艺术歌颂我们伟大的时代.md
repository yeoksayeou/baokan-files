Comrades Deputies, Comrades Committee Members:

	We listened with great excitement to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national final accounts and the 1960 national budget draft, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. These three reports fully demonstrate the magnificent picture of our country's economic and political life. We express our warm support for this and fully agree with the work reports of both the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

	Since 1958, our socialist construction has entered a new historical stage. The facts of the past two years eloquently prove that the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are three infinitely powerful magic weapons. With them, our country has rapidly changed its face, and miracles have appeared everywhere. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the great victory of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction.

	Our era is a great era, and our people are a great people. Following the victorious road indicated by the Party, the people of the whole country are advancing bravely with an indomitable spirit and unprecedentedly broad strides. This rapidly developing situation has presented film workers with a solemn task: to quickly reflect our current boiling life on the screen, to portray the heroic faces and advanced deeds of our contemporaries, to publicize communist ideology with vivid artistic images, to inspire the socialist construction enthusiasm of the masses, and to promote life faster towards the beautiful ideal of communism.

	We are revolutionary utilitarians, and our Party has always advocated that literature and art should serve production and politics, and should become a good component of the entire revolutionary machine. At the same time, our Party advocates that under the premise of serving socialism, the principle of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" should be implemented, and the development and prosperity of proletarian literature and art should be promoted in the competition of different schools and styles. Emphasizing the expression of modern themes does not mean ignoring historical or other themes. No matter what the theme of the work, as long as it correctly expresses the people's aspirations, the people's labor and struggle spirit, it will have a positive and beneficial impact on the masses, which is what the Party and the people need. However, it must be clear that in literary and artistic work, grasping the mainstream of life and reflecting the current reality is of particular significance in today's excellent situation.

	For the past two years, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, the film industry, like other literary and artistic undertakings, has seen a great leap forward and a great harvest. The output of films has greatly increased, and the ideological, artistic, and technical levels of films have been significantly improved. The themes and styles have also been greatly enriched, and the screen has begun to present a scene of colorful and prosperous flowers. It is particularly gratifying that the vigorous social outlook of our Great Leap Forward, and the heroic people of our heroic era, have been duly and timely reflected in film art.

	The achievement of this success is the result of the Party's long-term education and close care, the result of the creative staff going deep into life and among the masses, gradually changing their own thoughts and feelings, the result of carrying out socialist revolution politically and ideologically after rectification and anti-rightist struggles, and the result of resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy in the film industry.

	In our society, literary and art workers are fortunate because real life provides us with an infinitely rich source of creation. Due to limitations in our level, the life we reflect on the screen is far less magnificent and exciting than actual life. Our work is not yet good enough, but we have received the greatest encouragement from the audience. For example, the documentary art films shot in Shanghai in 1958, because they timely reflected the laboring people's spirited and enthusiastic construction zeal, the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, although some of these works were considered by the creators to be artistically crude, many factories organized workers to watch these films, and they were greatly inspired and educated, thereby promoting production and promoting technological innovation. The old workers of Guiyang Iron and Steel Plant felt that they were greatly educated after watching "Evergreen Tree" and expressed that "we must also find ways to change manual operation to mechanical operation and push production to a new climax." "Beside the March 8th River", which describes the advanced deeds of national model worker Chen Shuzhen, is welcomed by audiences everywhere, and many rural women regard the heroine in the film as a "shining example to learn from." After the workers and medical staff in Shanghai watched "Spring is Full of the World", they discussed their experiences and agreed that in this thrilling battle to save lives, "we once again saw how the light of the Party's thought illuminates people's path forward, and sincerely felt the happiness and warmth of living in a new society." They realized that "as long as there is the leadership of the Communist Party, any difficulties can be overcome." After "Five Golden Flowers" was screened in Yunnan, between the beautiful Cangshan Mountain and Erhai Lake, in many rural people's communes, in community-run factories, and on reservoir construction sites, thousands of advanced women named "Golden Flower" emerged, setting off a craze to "catch up with Golden Flower and surpass Golden Flower", and launching a competition of "flowers catching up with flowers and flowers helping flowers." "A Riot of Color is Always Spring" won the praise of a large number of female audiences because it expressed the aspirations of women in Shanghai's neighborhoods to participate in socialist construction. Many housewives were moved to tears by it, and after watching the film, their mood could not be calmed for a long time. It is entirely conceivable that in the urban people's commune movement that is about to flourish, it will be more welcomed and play a greater role. … The above are just some examples that are easily available. These examples vividly illustrate that films reflecting the current reality of life meet the needs of the broad masses of workers and peasants. The laboring people urgently demand that their wishes and struggles be expressed on the screen, which in turn inspires them to move forward continuously. As proletarian film workers, we have a responsibility to meet this legitimate demand.

	Adhering to the focus on reflecting modern life has proven to be a correct and healthy creative path. But to move forward by leaps and bounds in this direction, it is still necessary to eliminate various ideological obstacles and encounter many new problems that must be solved.

	Can film art reflect reality quickly and in a timely manner? On this issue, many film workers have had doubts and wavering. Their reasons are: reality is developing too fast, new things are appearing every moment, and they are undergoing dramatic changes every moment; it takes a considerable amount of time for a film from the creation of the script to the completion of the shooting, and by the time the film meets the audience, it often becomes yesterday's news, far behind the situation. They one-sidedly emphasized that the rapidly developing objective things have not yet taken shape, and the policy boundaries are difficult to grasp, so they regarded the creation of modern themes as a daunting task.

	But practice has proved that the problem is not whether there are objective difficulties, but whether subjective efforts are enough. Film art has broad mass appeal and great expressive power, and it is the most cutting-edge weapon of the Party's propaganda tools. It not only has the full possibility of quickly reflecting reality, but it is precisely its specialty. The development of life is changing rapidly, this is a fact, but the large number of new things and new atmospheres that appear, although they are still constantly growing and changing, are precisely the most typical things in our social life. Quickly and timely reflecting these new things and new atmospheres on the screen, helping the new things and new atmospheres grow and develop, is not only beneficial to the current real struggle, but also a precious historical record with long-term significance. In the past two years, we have already had many successful examples in this regard.

	Of course, film art should have works with higher generalization, greater typicality, and more artistic processing, which therefore require a longer creative process, but there should also be a large number of works that are full of enthusiasm, sensitive to feelings, and reflect reality in vivid and diverse forms, and delivered to the broad audience as quickly as possible. – This was unimaginable in the past, but now the facts have proven that it is entirely possible. Not long ago, Shanghai's "Shanghai Hero Symphony", which reflected the industrial Great Leap Forward, and "Rising Sun", which reflected the agricultural Great Leap Forward, were filmed quickly and well, and were warmly welcomed by audiences all over the country. "For Sixty-One Class Brothers", which is currently being screened, is a documentary art film made by Beijing Film Studio based on the shocking Pinglu Incident. Under the great collaboration of many famous directors, actors, composers, photographers, etc. in the capital, the film was completed in less than a month, and more than 800 copies were printed at one time for orders from all over the country. The high speed of filming, the wide range of social forces, literary and art units, and creative personnel involved in the collaboration, and the large number of copies distributed in this film are all brand new records in the history of Chinese film. Shanghai's Haiyan and Tianma Film Studios, in order to reflect the surging high tide of technological innovation and technological revolution, decided to make a feature film of the miracle of the Lianhua Strip Steel Plant's seven-day revolution; to make a documentary art film of the moving event of Wang Linhe starting from scratch, overcoming difficulties, failing 371 times, and finally creating a 10,000-volt high-voltage bridge. The planned time from the creation of the script to the completion of the shooting is also one month. These facts show that as long as there is the strong leadership of the Party and film workers summon up soaring enthusiasm, it is not only entirely possible to quickly reflect reality on the screen, but it can also be done very well.

	In works that reflect modern life, how to correctly handle contradictions and conflicts? For many creators, this is also a problem that has not been well resolved. They believe that from a dramatic point of view, it is easier to deal with historical themes because they express things that have already been concluded, and most of them are contradictions between the enemy and ourselves, which are life-and-death struggles. The contradictions and conflicts are sharp, and the storms and sorrows are easy to attract people, and there is more experience to learn from in terms of performance techniques. Works with modern themes often have to express contradictions among the people. These contradictions and conflicts are not sharp, so it is difficult to move people's hearts; and internal contradictions are not easy to handle, and if they are not grasped well, mistakes will be made.

	How to correctly handle contradictions among the people is indeed a new creative problem. But the above view contains many confused concepts, including old viewpoints and old tastes in creative thinking. Because: (1) Among the contradictions among the people, the main one is still the contradiction between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology. The ideological conflict between two opposing classes is of course very sharp and intense. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological field in our country will still take a considerable period of time to resolve. This is because the influence of the bourgeoisie and intellectuals from the old society will continue to exist in our country for a long time. … If there is insufficient understanding of this situation, or no understanding at all, then a great mistake will be made, and necessary ideological struggle will be neglected." It is completely wrong to think that class struggle no longer exists and that contradictions among the people are mainly contradictions between leaders and those being led. (2) The most common contradiction among the people, which currently exists in large numbers and will always exist in the future, is the contradiction between the advanced and the backward. From an ideological point of view, the conflict between the two may not be unsharp, especially in the face of rapidly developing situations, the contradictions will appear more prominent and the struggle will become more complicated. And under certain conditions, contradictions can transform each other. Internal contradictions can be transformed into contradictions between the enemy and ourselves, and contradictions between the enemy and ourselves can also be transformed into internal contradictions. Correctly handling this contradiction in creation not only has great educational significance, but also has very moving dramatic situations. (3) Film is an artistic work, and of course it is required to be able to touch the hearts of the audience, but it should be clear that this is only a means, not an end. No matter what means are used, the purpose is to infect the audience and educate the audience. Even from a purely dramatic effect: we are facing the great reality of 650 million people working together to build a communist paradise from a poor and blank land. What we see and hear is nothing but unprecedented and moving stories, and towering and daring figures. What in the world is more moving than these! The creative practice of the past two years has proved that as long as we dare to faithfully reflect this great reality on the screen, we can move the broad audience and be supported by the audience. The examples cited above are enough to illustrate this point.

	But to truly be a proletarian film artist, to truly become a singer of our great era, is not a simple matter. We must also undergo many strict tests and exercises.

	First of all, the biggest test facing film workers is how to make their thoughts and feelings adapt to the pulse of the times, their actions adapt to objective reality, and their works adapt to the needs of the masses. Literature and art are the barometer of the times, and literary and art workers should run ahead of the times; but from our current actual situation, this is not the case. The faster the situation develops, the more likely literary and art workers are to fall behind. If they do not catch up quickly, they themselves will become negative characters in life, so what qualifications do they have to be "engineers of the soul!"

	Fundamentally speaking, this is a question of transforming the world outlook. If the bourgeois world outlook still often interferes with us in our minds, and the proletarian world outlook has not yet been established. Then, of course, there is no talk of "educating the people with communist ideology." As an ideological form, literary and artistic works are the product of the reflection of a certain social life in the human mind. If the world outlook of film workers is not well transformed, and they cannot use the viewpoint of class struggle to master the weapon of class analysis, then even if they reflect modern life in their creations, they will not be able to reflect the mainstream and essence, or reflect it incorrectly, or even fall into principled errors.

	Thoroughly clearing away the bourgeois world outlook, firmly establishing the proletarian world outlook, and continuously carrying out ideological revolution and self-transformation are more urgent and important for film workers now than ever before.

	Secondly, to truly be able to reflect our great era, we should have great works worthy of this era. We should not only reflect reality with full enthusiasm, but also strive to reflect it correctly and well, which requires us to constantly transform our creative methods and improve our artistic skills.

	With the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, with the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, Chairman Mao put forward the creative principle of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. This is the combination of the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development, the combination of the revolutionary spirit and the realistic spirit of communists, and the combination of ideal and reality. It is the embodiment of our great real development in literary and artistic thought, and it has great guiding significance for the development of our literature and art. By mastering this principle, we can stand higher and see further, we can deeply root ourselves in the soil of reality, and yet ascend to distant ideals, so that our film artists can most freely gallop their imagination and most fully display their talents, so that the life reflected on the screen is "higher, more intense, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than ordinary actual life." But our understanding of this creative principle is still very insufficient, and we must go through diligent study, arduous efforts, and repeated verification in rational understanding and creative practice in order to master and apply it well.

	To solve these problems well, we can only put politics in command, conscientiously study Mao Zedong Thought, and gradually achieve it by constantly going deep into practice, combining with workers and peasants, constantly working hard and practicing diligently, and strengthening artistic practice. We firmly believe that as long as we resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, we will definitely be able to do this.

	At the reception celebrating the National Day New Film Exhibition Month, Premier Zhou pointed out: "The new people and new things, new heroes in our new society are full of the spirit of labor, the spirit of struggle, the spirit of collectivism, and the spirit of progress. Film should first reflect these new heroes and new things. Reflecting stories in this area and recording deeds in this area is the characteristic of our films." For film workers, this is a clear road sign.

	Let us use the most distinct class feelings and the most perfect artistic forms to sing the praises of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, sing the praises of the Great Leap Forward, and sing the praises of the People's Communes! This is our sacred responsibility, our greatest glory, and our greatest happiness!

    用电影艺术歌颂我们伟大的时代
    白杨　赵丹　黄佐临　陈鲤庭　郑君里　张瑞芳　柯灵　代表委员的发言各位代表、各位委员：
    我们以十分激动的心情，听了李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和谭震林副总理为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告。在这三个报告里，充分展示了我国经济生活和政治生活的宏伟图景。我们对此表示热烈的拥护，并完全同意全国人民代表大会常务委员会和政协全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。
    从1958年开始，我国社会主义建设迈入了新的历史阶段。两年来的事实雄辩地证明：党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社是三个威力无边的法宝，有了它们，我们国家就迅速改变了面貌，到处出现了奇迹。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的伟大胜利。
    我们的时代是伟大的时代，我们的人民是伟大的人民。循着党所指引的胜利的道路，全国人民正以一往无前的气概，空前阔大的步伐，奋勇前进。这飞跃发展的形势，给电影工作者提出了一个庄严的任务，这就是：在银幕上迅速反映我们当前沸腾般的生活，表现我们同时代人的英雄面貌和先进事迹，以鲜明的艺术形象宣传共产主义思想，鼓舞人民群众的社会主义建设热情，并为着共产主义的美好理想，把生活更快地向前推进。
    我们是革命的功利主义者，我们党从来主张：文学艺术应该为生产、为政治服务，应该很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分。同时我们党主张：在为社会主义服务的前提下，实行“百花齐放”，在不同流派、不同风格的竞赛中，促进无产阶级文学艺术的发展和繁荣。强调表现现代题材，并不意味着不重视历史或其它题材，不论什么题材的作品，只要正确地表达出人民的愿望，人民的劳动和斗争精神，就会在群众中产生积极和有益的影响，也就是党和人民所需要的。但是，必须明确：在文学艺术工作中，掌握生活的主流，反映当前的现实，在今天这样大好的形势之下，特别具有重大的意义。
    两年以来，电影事业在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，和其它文学艺术事业一样，出现了大跃进、大丰收的局面。影片的产量有了很大的增长，影片的思想性、艺术性和技术水平有了显著的提高，题材、样式也大大地丰富了，银幕上开始呈现万紫千红、繁花如锦的景象。特别可喜的一点，是我们大跃进中蓬蓬勃勃的社会风貌，我们英雄时代的英雄人民，在电影艺术中得到了应有的及时的反映。
    这种成绩的取得，是党长期教导、亲切关怀的结果，创作人员深入生活、深入群众，逐步改变了自己的思想感情的结果，是经过整风反右，政治上、思想上进行社会主义革命的结果，在电影事业中坚决执行毛主席的文艺方针的结果。
    在我们的社会里，文艺工作者是幸运的，因为现实生活为我们提供了无限丰富的创作源泉。由于水平的限制，我们在银幕上所反映的生活，还远不如实际生活的瑰丽多彩，激动人心。我们的工作还做得不够，但是我们却受到了观众最大的鼓励。例如：1958年上海所拍摄的纪录性艺术片，因为及时反映了劳动人民意气风发、干劲冲天的建设热情，敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，尽管其中有些作品，创作人员自认为艺术上还很粗糙，不少工厂组织工人看了这些片子以后，却由此得到极大的启发和教育，从而推动了生产，促进了技术革新。贵阳钢铁厂的老工人，看了“常青树”以后，都认为教育很大，表示“一定也要想办法把手工操作改为机械操作，把生产推向新的高潮。”描写全国劳动模范陈淑贞的先进事迹的“三八河边”，到处受到观众的欢迎，许多农民妇女把影片中的女主人公当作“学习的光辉的榜样”。上海的工人和医务工作者看了“春满人间”以后，座谈体会，大家都认为，在这一场惊心动魄的抢救生命的战斗中，“又一次看到了党的思想光芒是如何地烛照着人们前进的道路，由衷地感到生活在新社会里的幸福和温暖。”认识到“只要有共产党的领导，任何困难都能突破。”“五朵金花”在云南放映以后，在美丽如画的苍山洱海之间，在很多农村人民公社，在社办工厂中，在水库工地上，就出现了成千上万以“金花”命名的先进妇女，掀起了“赶金花、超金花”的热潮，展开了“花赶花、花帮花”的竞赛。“万紫千红总是春”因为表达了上海里弄妇女参加社会主义建设的心愿，博得广大妇女观众的赞扬，不少家庭妇女为它激动得流了泪，看过影片以后，心情许久不能平静。完全可以设想，在即将蓬勃开展的城市人民公社运动中，它将会受更大的欢迎，起更大的作用。……以上只是一些信手拈来的例子。这些例子生动地说明了：反映当前现实生活的影片，是符合广大工农群众的需要的，劳动人民迫切要求在银幕上表现自己的愿望和斗争，又反过来鼓舞自己不断前进。作为无产阶级的电影工作者，我们有责任满足这种正当的要求。
    坚持以反映现代生活为主，事实证明是正确和健康的创作道路。但要循着这个方向大踏步前进，却还需要扫除各种各样的思想障碍，还会遇到许多必须解决的新问题。
    电影艺术能不能迅速及时地反映现实？在这个问题上，不少电影工作者就曾经有过怀疑和动摇，他们的理由是：现实发展太快了，新事物每时每刻都在出现，而又每时每刻都在发生急剧的变化；一部影片从创作剧本到拍摄完成，需要相当长的时间，等到影片和观众见面，往往成了明日黄花，远远地落在形势的后面。他们片面地强调了迅速发展中的客观事物尚未定型，政策界线难于掌握，因此把反映现代题材的创作视为畏途。
    但是实践证明，问题不在于有没有客观困难，而在于主观努力够不够。电影艺术具有广泛的群众性和极大的表现力，是党的宣传工具中最尖端的武器，不但有迅速反映现实的充分可能，而且正是它的特长。生活的发展瞬息万变，这是事实，但大量出现的新事物、新气象，尽管它们还在不断的成长变化，却正是我们社会生活中最典型的东西。迅速及时地在银幕上反映这些新事物、新气象，帮助新事物、新气象的成长发展，不但有益于当前的现实斗争，也是具有长远意义的珍贵的历史纪录。两年来，我们在这方面已经有了不少成功的例证。
    当然，电影艺术中应当有概括性较高、典型性较大、艺术加工较多，因此也需要较长的创作过程的作品，但更应该有大量热气蓬勃、感应敏锐，以生动活泼、多种多样的形式反映现实的作品，以最快的速度，送到广大观众的面前。——这在过去是不可设想的，现在事实已经证明是完全可能的了。不久以前，上海摄制的反映工业大跃进的“上海英雄交响曲”、农业大跃进的“旭日东升”，就拍得既快又好，受到全国各地观众的热烈欢迎。最近正在放映的“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”，是北京电影制片厂根据震撼人心的平陆事件而制成的纪录性艺术片，在首都许多著名的导演、演员、作曲家、摄影师等等大协作之下，不到一个月时间，就把影片拍成了，全国各地订购的拷贝，一次就洗印了八百多个。这个影片拍摄的高速度，协作的社会力量、文艺单位和创作人员之广，以及发行的拷贝数量之多，在中国电影史上都是崭新的纪录。上海的海燕、天马制片厂，为了反映奔腾澎湃的技术革新和技术革命高潮，决定把联华带钢厂七天革个命的奇迹拍成故事片；把王林鹤白手起家，攻克尖端，失败三百七十一次，而终于造成了一万伏高压电桥的动人事件拍成纪录性艺术片，从创作剧本到拍摄完成，预定的时间也是一个月。这些事实表明，只要有党的坚强领导，电影工作者鼓起冲天干劲，那么在银幕上迅速反映现实不但是完全可能，而且可以做得很好。
    在反映现代生活的作品中，如何正确地处理矛盾冲突？对不少创作人员来说，也是个没有很好解决的问题。他们认为：从戏剧性要求来看，处理历史题材是比较容易的，因为它所表现的是已经有了定论的事情，而且多数是敌我之间的矛盾，是你死我活的斗争，矛盾冲突尖锐，疾风骤雨，悲欢离合，容易引人入胜，在表现手法上，也有较多的经验可以吸取。现代题材的作品，就经常要表现人民内部矛盾，这种矛盾冲突既不尖锐，也就很难动人心弦；并且内部矛盾不易处理，掌握得不好，就要犯错误。
    如何正确处理人民内部矛盾，的确是个创作上的新问题。但上述的看法中间，却包含着许多糊涂观念，包括了创作思想上的旧观点、旧趣味。因为：（一）人民内部矛盾中间，主要的，也还是无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想之间的矛盾，两种敌对阶级的思想冲突，当然是十分尖锐剧烈的。毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中指出：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。这是因为资产阶级和从旧社会来的知识分子的影响还要在我国长期存在，……如果对于这种形势认识不足，或者根本不认识，那就要犯绝大的错误，就会忽视必要的思想斗争。”认为阶级斗争已经不存在，人民内部矛盾主要是领导与被领导之间的矛盾，是完全错误的。（二）人民内部矛盾中间最常见的，目前大量存在，将来也会永久存在的，是先进与落后的矛盾。从思想角度看，两者之间的冲突也未必不尖锐，特别是在迅速发展的形势前面，矛盾会显得更突出，斗争会变得更复杂。而且在一定的条件底下，矛盾会互相转化，内部矛盾可以转化为敌我矛盾，敌我矛盾也可以转化为内部矛盾。在创作中正确处理这种矛盾，不但有极大的教育意义，也会有非常动人的戏剧情境。（三）电影是艺术作品，当然要求能够打动观众的心，但应该明确，这只是手段，而不是目的，不论用什么手段，目的都是为了感染观众，教育观众。即使从单纯的戏剧效果看：我们面对的是六亿五千万人同心同德，从一穷二白的土地上建设共产主义天堂的伟大现实，我们目有所见，耳有所闻，无一不是旷古绝今、可歌可泣的故事，顶天立地、敢想敢做的人物，世界上有什么比这些更动人心弦的呢！两年来的创作实践证明，只要我们敢于忠实地在银幕上反映出这种伟大的现实，就能够感动广大的观众，受到观众的拥护。前面所举的例子，已经足够说明这一点。
    但要真正做一名无产阶级的电影艺术家，真正成为我们这个伟大的时代的歌手，并不是一件简单的事，还要经受许多严格的考验和锻炼。
    首先，电影工作者面临的最大考验，是如何使自己的思想感情和时代脉搏相适应，行动和客观实际相适应，作品和群众需要相适应。文学艺术是时代的风雨表，文艺工作者应该跑在时代的前面；但从目前我们的实际情况看，却并不是这样，形势发展得越快，文艺工作者往往越有落后的危险，如果不急起直追，本身就会变成生活里的反面人物，还有什么资格当“灵魂的工程师！”
    从根本上来说，这是个改造世界观的问题。如果资产阶级的世界观还经常在头脑里干扰我们，无产阶级的世界观还没有树立起来。那么，当然谈不到什么“用共产主义思想教育人民”。作为观念形态的文艺作品，是一定的社会生活在人类头脑中的反映的产物，电影工作者的世界观不经过很好的改造，不能运用阶级斗争的观点，掌握阶级分析的武器，那么，即使在创作中反映了现代生活，也会发生不能反映主流和本质，或者反映得不正确，甚至陷于原则性错误等等的情况。
    彻底清除资产阶级世界观，牢固地树立起无产阶级世界观，不断的进行思想革命，自我改造，对电影工作者来说，现在比任何时候都显得迫切和重要。
    其次，要真正能够反映我们伟大的时代，应该有无愧于这个时代的伟大作品。我们不但应该满腔热情的反映现实，还应该力求反映得正确，反映得好，这就要不断的改造创作方法，提高艺术技巧。
    随着党的社会主义建设总路线，随着大跃进的新形势，毛主席提出了革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的创作原则。这是不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合、共产主义者的革命精神和求实精神相结合、理想和现实相结合的体现，是我们伟大的现实发展在文艺思想上的体现，对我们文学艺术的发展有巨大的指导意义。掌握了这个原则，我们就能够站得更高，看得更远，就能够深入地植根于现实的土壤，而又向宏远的理想飞升，就能够使我们的电影艺术家最自由地驰骋自己的想像，最充分地施展自己的才华，使银幕上所反映的生活，“比普通的实际生活更高、更强烈、更有集中性、更典型、更理想。”但我们对这个创作原则的理解还非常不够，还必须通过勤恳的学习，刻苦的努力，在理性认识和创作实践的反复印证中，才能够很好的掌握和运用。
    要很好的解决这些问题，只有政治挂帅，认真学习毛泽东思想，在不断深入实际，和工农群众相结合，不断勤修苦练，加强艺术实践的过程中，逐步地做到。我们深信，只要坚决依靠党的领导，一定能做到这一点。
    在庆祝建国十年新片展览月招待会上，周总理曾经指出：“我们新社会里的新人新事，新的英雄，是富有劳动的精神、战斗的精神、集体的精神、向上的精神的，电影首先就要反映这些新的英雄、新的事物。反映这方面的故事，纪录这方面的事迹，这就是我们电影的特点。”对电影工作者来说，这是一个明确的路标。
    让我们以最鲜明的阶级感情，最完美的艺术形式，歌颂党的社会主义建设总路线，歌颂大跃进，歌颂人民公社！这是我们神圣的责任，我们最大的光荣，也是我们最大的幸福！
