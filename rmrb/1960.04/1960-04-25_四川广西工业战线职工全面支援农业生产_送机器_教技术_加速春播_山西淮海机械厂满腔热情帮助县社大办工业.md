Sichuan and Guangxi Industrial Front Workers Comprehensively Support Agricultural Production
　　Sending Machines, Teaching Technology, Accelerating Spring Planting
　　Shanxi Huaihai Machinery Plant Enthusiastically Helps Counties and Communes Vigorously Develop Industry

　　(Reported by this newspaper) In the first quarter of this year, factories and mining enterprises in Sichuan Province further launched a mass movement of industry supporting agriculture and achieved remarkable results.

　　By the end of March, according to incomplete statistics from sixteen special districts and cities, among more than 4,300 factories and mining enterprises above the county level, 2,351 factories and mines had been linked with 2,076 communes. Under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, the following support work was carried out: 11,707 workers were transferred back to the countryside to join the front line of agricultural production; factory and mine workers used their spare time and rest time to go to the countryside to help accumulate fertilizer and deliver manure, carrying out temporary shock production for a total of more than 1.32 million person-times, working more than 2.29 million workdays; helping communes establish 22,236 factories, mainly including farm tool factories, fertilizer factories, pesticide factories, and agricultural and sideline product processing factories urgently needed by the countryside; training more than 95,000 various technical personnel for the communes, and transferring 3,243 technical personnel to the countryside; to meet the needs of spring plowing, in the first quarter, 62,406 horsepower of power drainage and irrigation equipment, 72,594 sets of water lifting tools, more than 838,000 sets (pieces) of various tillage machinery, more than 200,050 parts of rural transportation tools and machinery, more than 19.21 million pieces of various small farm tools, more than 9.48 million tons of chemical fertilizer (including local chemical fertilizer), and more than 320,000 tons of pesticides (including local pesticides) were produced.

　　At present, the movement of industry supporting agriculture has been launched everywhere and is developing towards a new stage of large factories contracting large counties, medium factories contracting medium counties, and small factories contracting small counties or people's communes, as instructed by the Provincial Party Committee.

　　(Reported by this newspaper) In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, industrial workers' support for agricultural production has formed a massive mass movement.

　　The autonomous region's allocation of materials for industrial support to agriculture this year exceeded any previous year. In steel alone, 46.91% of the total amount of steel used in the first quarter was used to support agriculture; cement used for agriculture in the first quarter accounted for 41.8%; the total output value of agricultural machinery in the first quarter accounted for about 60% of the total output value of the entire machinery industry, an increase of one time compared with the same period last year.

　　A relatively prominent feature of Guangxi's industrial support for agriculture this year is the large quantity and high quality of products. This year, the region produced 200,000 rice transplanters in the first quarter, which is a powerful promotion for the region to complete the rice transplanting task ahead of schedule. All industrial departments in the region also gave comprehensive support to agriculture from manpower, materials, financial resources, and technical strength. Many factories took the initiative to go deep into the countryside, link up with communes, and sign cooperation contracts, to achieve "response to every request." Since March, various places have also organized a technical team to rush-repair agricultural machinery, going deep into the communes to help members repair machinery, teaching while repairing, and the effect is very good. According to statistics, nearly 3,000 workers have been drawn from agricultural machinery factories above the county level throughout the region and sent to various special districts, counties, and communes to rush-repair agricultural machinery.

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The state-owned Huaihai Machinery Plant in Shanxi Province strongly supports the development of industry in the nearby fourteen counties and more than fifty people's communes with materials and technology, which has powerfully promoted the technological transformation of agriculture.

　　On the one hand, the factory workers actively produce modern equipment specified in the state plan to support the countryside; on the other hand, they tap the production potential of the enterprise, use waste materials, and increase the production of machines to support the industry of counties and communes. In more than a year, the factory has increased the production of more than 410 sets of simple lathes, bench drills, shapers, etc., and repaired more than 130 old lathes, directly equipping the local industry and commune industry of various counties.

　　After the development of county and commune industries, the factory has successively transferred more than 50 management personnel, technical personnel, and skilled workers to support factories in various counties and communes. They also ran training classes, specializing in training more than 990 skilled workers for nearby counties and communes.

　　The strong support of this factory has greatly promoted the industrial development of the nearby fourteen counties and more than fifty people's communes. Now, every county has a machinery factory, and many communes have established farm tool factories.

    四川广西工业战线职工全面支援农业生产
    送机器　教技术　加速春播
    山西淮海机械厂满腔热情帮助县社大办工业
    本报讯　今年一季度，四川省各厂矿企业进一步开展了工业支援农业的群众性运动，并取得了显著成绩。
    到3月底止，据十六个专、市不完全统计，在四千三百多个县属以上厂矿企业中，已有二千三百五十一个厂矿和二千零七十六个公社挂了钩。在当地党委统一领导下作了以下支援工作：抽减劳动力一万一千七百零七人回到农村，投入农业生产第一线；厂矿职工利用业余和休息时间，下乡帮助农村积肥、送粪，临时突击生产共一百三十二万多人次，劳动了二百二十九万多个工作日；帮助公社建立了二万二千二百三十六个工厂，其中主要是农具厂、农肥厂、农药厂和农副产品加工厂等为农村急需的工厂；为公社培养了各种技术人材九万五千多名，并给农村输送了技术人员三千二百四十三名；适应春耕生产的需要，一季度生产了排灌动力设备六万二千四百零六马力，提水工具七万二千五百九十四部，各种耕作机具八十三万八千多台（件），农村运输工具机具二十万零五千多部件，各种小型农具一千九百二十一万多件，化肥（包括土化肥）九百四十八万多吨，农药（包括土农药）三十二万多吨。
    目前，工业支援农业的运动各地都已经开展起来了，并正在向省委指示的大厂包大县、中厂包中县、小厂包小县或人民公社的新阶段发展。
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区工业职工支援农业生产，形成了声势浩大的群众运动。
    自治区今年在工业支援农业的物资分配上，超过已往任何一年。单钢材一项，第一季度用于支援农业的就占用材总数的46.91％；水泥第一季度用于农业的占41.8％；第一季度农业机械的生产总值约占全部机械工业总产值的60％，比去年同期增长一倍。
    今年广西工业支援农业的一个比较突出的特点，是产品数量多，质量高。今年全区第一季度生产二十万部插秧机，这对全区提前完成插秧任务是一个有力的促进。全区各工业部门还从人力、物力、财力到技术力量给农业以全面的支援。许多厂主动深入农村，与公社挂钩，订立协作合同，做到“有求必应”。从3月份起，各地还组织了一支抢修农械的技术队伍，深入各公社，帮助社员补修机械，边修边教，效果很好。据统计，全区县以上农械厂抽出近三千多名职工，分赴各专区、县、公社抢修农业机械。
    本报讯　山西省国营淮海机械厂从物资、技术等方面大力支援附近十四个县和五十多个人民公社发展工业，有力地促进了农业技术改造。
    全厂职工一方面积极生产国家计划规定的现代化设备支援农村；一方面挖掘企业生产潜力，利用废料，增产机器，支援县社工业。全厂在一年多的时间内，增产了简易元车、台钻、牛头刨床等四百一十多台，修理了一百三十多台旧车床，直接装备了各县的地方工业和公社工业。
    县社工业发展以后，这个厂先后调出了管理人员、技术人员、技术工人五十多名，支援各县和公社工厂。还开办训练班，专门为附近县、社培养、训练了九百九十多名技术工人。
    这个厂的大力支援，促使附近十四个县和五十多个人民公社的工业有了很大的发展。现在，每个县都有了机械厂，许多公社都建立了农具厂。
