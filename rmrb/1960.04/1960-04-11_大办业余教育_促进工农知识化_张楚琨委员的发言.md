Vigorously Develop Amateur Education to Promote the Intellectualization of Workers and Peasants
Speech by Committee Member Zhang Chukun

I am a returned overseas Chinese, engaged in cultural, educational, health, and sports work in Xiamen. The people of this city, standing at the forefront of coastal defense, are, like the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, holding high the banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. The people of Xiamen are determined, while fighting for the liberation of Jinmen and Dadan, to build their city into a modern port; an industrial base advancing towards high-end, precision, and advanced technology; a tourist and resort area; and a civilized city with modern science and culture. In education, we have already achieved having primary schools and kindergartens in every team, and middle schools in every district and commune. The city has a complete set of institutions of higher learning, including industry, aquatic products, medicine, and teacher training. The quality of secondary school education has leaped into the ranks of advanced education in the country. A one-stop amateur education system from literacy classes to colleges has been formed. About 240,000 people are studying in various schools, accounting for more than 40% of the city's population. The working people who wield axes and sickles have not forgotten to hold guns, nor have they forgotten to hold books. Their strong desire to conquer the bastions of culture and science, and their heroic spirit of strategically despising difficulties and tactically studying diligently, have deeply inspired and educated me in my work.

	Amateur Education is the Way to Promote the
	Intellectualization of the Masses of Workers and Peasants

The broad masses of workers, in the Great Leap Forward, demand to rapidly improve their political awareness and cultural and technical level. Countless examples show that when workers master culture and science, they advance by leaps and bounds, like a winged steed. The Xiamen Shipyard vigorously develops amateur education, and cultural revolution and technical revolution bloom side by side. In just over two months this year, it has achieved 4,202 major and minor innovation projects. This is a fundamental change compared to 1956, when illiteracy was prevalent in the factory and technicians in the hull workshop used small stones to sketch and calculate hull dimensions on the ground. Yan Jianlin, a famous innovation expert and veteran technician in the factory, conquered the mountain of illiteracy, understood geometric principles, and successfully designed a die for punching hexagonal screws, increasing work efficiency by 119 times. This greatly stimulated his enthusiasm for climbing the peak of science and technology. He goes to bookstores to buy books whenever he has time. He said, "In the past, I only relied on old experience to work. Now that I have culture, it is easier to study politics, I can read technical books, and innovation is more effective. I only studied to junior high school level. To master modern science and technology, I must reach college level." Listen to this – this is the ambition of the working class!

The farmers' eagerness for culture and science is no less than that of the workers. The example of the members of the Aoguan Brigade of the Haicang People's Commune in Xiamen, who persist in learning and promote production, is enough to illustrate this. Lin Zhonghan, the brigade's storekeeper and technician, used to be illiterate. When he went to other places to learn advanced experience in soil improvement, he relied on his two ears, and forgot half of it when he came back. After he reached the level of higher primary school in 1959, he went to visit again. This time, not only could he take some notes, but he could also read books, look at diagrams, and calculate. After returning, he organized the members to transform more than 300 mu of low-yielding terraced fields and mountain fields into high-yielding fields with a yield of 1,184 jin per mu. Over the years, this team has persisted in learning as one day, training 57 management cadres, 60 technicians, 28 teachers, 77 students who went to secondary schools, and all 611 illiterates have shaken off the label of illiteracy.

From these vivid examples, I have realized that the masses of workers and peasants' demand to master modern science and culture is bound to be achieved and definitely can be achieved. Lenin taught us: "Illiterates cannot achieve electrification, and it is not enough to be merely literate. They must also understand how to technically apply electricity to industry and agriculture, and apply it to all sectors of industry and agriculture… Only those who have received modern education can build a communist society." The masses of workers and peasants have recognized the truth that "Communism is heaven, and you cannot go there without culture" from their own experience, actively responding to the Party's call for a cultural revolution, and demanding to be the masters of culture. Because their production tasks are tight and they cannot leave production for a long time to study, amateur education has become their main way to improve their culture. In this way, under the light of Mao Zedong Thought, according to the educational policy of "walking on two legs," we have found a broad road to promote the intellectualization of workers and peasants in a faster, better, and more economical way, and to cultivate technical talents of the working class. This road is of great significance for realizing the technological transformation of the national economy during the period of socialist construction, and also of great significance for the future transition from socialism to communism. This is a great contribution of Chairman Mao to the Marxist science of education.

	Mobilize All Positive Factors to
	Vigorously Develop Amateur Education

National amateur education is about launching a mass movement. By fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses for running education, and letting thousands upon thousands of people's communes, enterprises, factories, mines, and government organs run schools, we can quickly solve problems such as school buildings, equipment, and teachers with this endless potential, and run more schools with the fastest speed and the least money.

The amateur education movement must embody the spirit of continuous revolution. From literacy, higher primary school, middle school to college, it is necessary to connect link by link, and go all out in one breath. For the sake of tomorrow, we must break through one barrier after another today. The teaching content and teaching methods must also be updated according to the changes in production practice, both daily and constantly. Development, consolidation, and improvement should be combined to push the amateur education movement to a new peak.

The guarantee for running amateur education well lies in the leadership of the Party. Wherever the Party committee attaches importance to, supports, and adheres to putting politics in command, amateur education will blossom and bear fruit. Over the years, Xiamen has seen many "iron people's schools" that are "unshaken by wind, undisturbed by rain, and evergreen in all seasons." Their common feature is that the Party committee secretaries at all levels personally take charge, grasping production with one hand and learning with the other, unifying leadership, unifying arrangements, unifying deployments, unifying inspections, and unifying evaluations. The contradiction between production and learning is resolved, and it can be sustained. In the words of the grassroots, "If you grasp it at all times and in all places, cultural learning will not collapse."

The fundamental policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor" should be resolutely implemented in amateur education, so that politics, culture, and technology are combined. Many amateur schools in Xiamen, in order to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, combined with language courses to teach "wonderful ways to cure middle-of-the-road thinking." In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, they teach technology and related theories according to production needs. The teaching organizational forms and learning time in workshops, fields, and construction sites flexibly adapt to the characteristics of production. All those who implement the principle of "combining with production, unified arrangement, teaching according to aptitude, and flexibility and diversity" can persist, consolidate, and improve.

In the process of developing and improving amateur education, training teachers is a key issue. Xiamen City has achieved some success in teacher training by implementing the policies of long-term training and short-term training simultaneously; combining on-the-job training with full-time and part-time training; and combining training by education departments and training by school-running units. There are worker-peasant teacher training classes in urban areas, amateur normal schools in suburban areas, junior amateur normal schools in communes, as well as short-term teacher training classes lasting from one week to half a month, and a hundred-member lecturer group, and so on. The Party is thus extensively, diversely, and in every possible way training and improving amateur teachers to meet the needs of the educational revolution. Now, the vast number of amateur teachers in Xiamen are launching a revolutionary competition of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping, determined to achieve "three guarantees" and "six diligences." "Three guarantees" means guaranteeing quality, guaranteeing quantity, and guaranteeing the Great Leap Forward; "Six diligences" means diligently mobilizing, diligently preparing lessons, diligently teaching, diligently tutoring and making up lessons, diligently grading homework, and diligently learning advanced experience.

The current new upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution in our country requires that industrial and agricultural amateur education be developed faster and better. This sign of a new stage in socialist construction – the technical revolution movement, the production revolution movement, and the ideological revolution movement – has further driven the cultural revolution, and the cultural revolution has in turn influenced construction. Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report: "This movement will inevitably accelerate the process of modernization of industry, modernization of agriculture, and modernization of science and culture in our country, further improve the speed of socialist construction, and further improve the communist consciousness and scientific, technological, and cultural level of the people." I have realized what arduous and glorious tasks amateur education should undertake in the new situation!

Let all the masses of workers and peasants bathe in the spring breeze and rain of the Party, let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance towards the cultural revolution! The time has come when Chairman Mao's instruction, "With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear," has arrived!

    大办业余教育　促进工农知识化
    张楚琨委员的发言
    我是一个归国华侨，在厦门市参加文教卫生体育方面的工作。这个屹立在海防最前线的城市的人民，同全国人民一样，正在党的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的旗帜，多快好省地建设社会主义。厦门人民决心在为解放金台而斗争的同时，把自己的城市建成一个现代港口；一个向高、精、尖前进的工业基地；一个游览区和休养区；一个具有现代科学文化的文明城市。我们在教育事业方面：已经达到队队有小学、幼儿园，区区社社有中学。全市有工业、水产、医学、师范等一套高等学校。中等学校的教育质量已经跃入全国先进教育行列。从扫盲班到大专学校的一条龙的业余教育体系已经形成。约有二十四万人在各类学校学习，占全市人口40％以上。拿斧头、镰刀的劳动人民，没有忘记拿枪，也没有忘记拿书本，他们那种要求攻克文化科学堡垒的强烈愿望，那种战略上蔑视困难，战术上勤学苦练的豪迈气概，使我在工作中深受启发和教育。
      业余教育是促进工农
      群众知识化的途径
    广大的工人群众在大跃进中要求迅速提高自己的政治觉悟和文化技术水平。无数的实例表明，工人掌握了文化科学，正如骏马添翼，飞跃前进。厦门造船厂大办业余教育，文化革命与技术革命并蒂开花。今年仅仅两个多月，实现大小革新项目已达四千二百零二件，比起1956年厂内文盲占多数、船体车间技工拿小石头在地上比划排算船体尺寸的情况，根本变了样。这个厂著名的革新能手严建霖老技工，攻下了文盲山，懂得几何原理，设计成功冲六角螺丝胎具，提高工效一百一十九倍，大大激起攀登科学技术高峰的热情，一有空就上书店买书，他说：“过去只凭老经验干活，现在有了文化，学习政治便当，会看技术书，革新更有办法。我只念到初中程度，要掌握现代科学技术，非达到高等学校不可。”听一听，这就是工人阶级的雄心大志！
    农民对于文化科学要求的迫切，不减于工人。厦门海沧人民公社鳌冠大队社员坚持学习、推动生产的实例足以说明。这个队保管员兼技术员林中汉，过去是个文盲，当时到外地学习改良土壤的先进经验，凭着两只耳朵，回来忘了一半；1959年学习达到高小水平之后，又去参观了，这回不但能记些笔记，还能看书、看图和计算，回来组织社员把三百多亩低产的梯田、山垅田变亩产一千一百八十四斤的高产田。这个队几年来坚持学习如一日，培养了管理干部五十七名，技工六十名，教师二十八名，到中等学校学习的七十七名，六百一十一名文盲全部摘掉文盲帽子。
    我从这些活生生的例子体会到，工农群众要求掌握现代科学文化，是一定要达到而且一定能达到的。列宁教导我们：“不识字的不能实现电气化，而且仅仅识字还不够，还应该懂得怎样在技术上把电气用到工农业上去，应用到工农业的各部门中去。……只有受了现代教育，他们才能建立共产主义社会。”工农群众正是从切身经验中认识了“共产主义是天堂，没有文化不能上”的真理，积极响应党的文化革命的号召，要求做文化的主人。由于他们生产任务紧，不能长期脱产学习，业余教育成为他们提高文化的主要途径。这样，我们在毛泽东思想的照耀下，根据“两条腿走路”的办学方针，找到一条多快好省促进工农群众知识化，培养工人阶级技术人才的宽广道路。这条道路，对于社会主义建设时期实现国民经济技术改造具有重大意义，对于将来从社会主义过渡到共产主义，也具有重大意义。这是毛主席对于马克思主义教育科学一个伟大的贡献。
      调动一切积极因素
      大办业余教育
    全民办业余教育就是要大搞群众运动。把群众办教育的积极性充分调动起来，让千千万万的人民公社、企业、厂矿、机关都来办学，利用这无穷无尽的潜力，就能迅速解决校舍、设备、师资等问题，以最快的速度，用最少的钱，办更多的学校。
    业余教育运动要体现不断革命的精神。从脱盲、高小、中学到大专，是要环环衔接，一鼓作气的，为了明天，今天不能不闯了一关又一关。教学内容和教学方法也要根据生产实际的变化，既日新，日日新，又日新。发展，巩固，提高，三者结合起来，把业余教育运动推向新的高峰。
    办好业余教育的保证在于党的领导。哪里党委重视，支持，坚持政治挂帅的，那里的业余教育就开花结果。厦门几年来出现了不少“风吹不倒，雨打不散，四季常青”的“铁民校”，其共同特点就是各级党委书记亲自挂帅，一手抓生产，一手抓学习，统一领导，统一安排，统一布置，统一检查，统一评比。生产与学习的矛盾解决了，就能坚持。用基层的说法是：“时时抓，处处抓，文化学习不会垮。”
    “教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的根本性方针，应该在业余教育中坚决贯彻，做到政治、文化、技术三结合。厦门不少业余学校，为了反右倾，鼓干劲，结合语文课，讲授了“医治中游思想的良方妙术”。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，根据生产需要讲授技术和有关理论。车间、田间、工地的教学组织形式和学习时间，灵活地与生产特点相适应。凡是贯彻执行“结合生产，统一安排，因材施教，灵活多样”的原则的，都能坚持，巩固和提高。
    在发展和提高业余教育的过程中，培养师资是一个关键问题。厦门市在培养师资工作中贯彻了长期培养与短期训练并举；业余进修与脱产半脱产学习并举；教育部门培训和办学单位培训并举等方针，获得一些成绩。市区有工农教师进修班，郊区有业余师范，公社有初级业余师范，还有一周到半个月的短期师资训练班，百人讲师团，等等。党就是这样广泛地，多种多样地，千方百计地培养和提高业余师资，以适应教育大革命的需要。现在，厦门广大业余教师正在展开学、比、赶、帮的革命竞赛，决心做到“三包”、“六勤”。“三包”就是包质、包量，包跃进；“六勤”就是勤动员，勤备课，勤教学，勤辅导补课，勤批改作业，勤学习先进经验。
    目前我国的技术革新和技术革命的新高潮，要求工农业余教育更快更好地开展起来。这一社会主义建设进入新阶段的标志——技术大革命运动，生产大革命运动，思想大革命运动，进一步带动了文化革命，并使文化革命反过来影响建设。李富春副总理在报告中说：“这个运动必将加快我国工业现代化、农业现代化和科学文化现代化的进程，进一步提高社会主义建设的速度，进一步提高人民群众的共产主义觉悟和科学技术文化水平。”我体会到业余教育在新形势下应该负起怎样艰巨而光荣的任务！
    让所有工农群众都沐浴在党的春风化雨之中吧，让我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，向文化革命进军吧，毛主席指示的“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮”的时候到了！
