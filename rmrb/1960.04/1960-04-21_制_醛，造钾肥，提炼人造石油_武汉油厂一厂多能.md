Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Dispatch: The workers of the Wuhan Oil Factory are vigorously engaging in the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, increasing the variety of products from one to seventeen, realizing multi-functionality of the factory, multi-use of materials, multi-skill of personnel, multiplied output value, and reduced costs.

The Wuhan Oil Factory used to mainly refine edible vegetable oil. Starting from the Great Leap Forward in 1958, this factory began to develop towards a modern oil and fat chemical factory, vigorously engaging in the comprehensive utilization of by-products. They utilized the cotton seed skins, left after pressing oil and cake from the main raw material cotton seeds, to produce the chemical raw material formaldehyde. The remaining residue is partly processed into high-grade potash fertilizer, and partly used to make battery activated carbon and decolorizing activated carbon. The waste water flowing from the distillation tanks during the refining of formaldehyde is used to make sodium acetate. The oil footings from the refining of crude oil are partly handed over to chemical factories to manufacture soap and glycerin, partly refined into fatty acids, oleic acid, and synthetic petroleum, and partly refined into industrial oil. Oil cake is used to make liquid monosodium glutamate. Residue can also be used as feed. The short fibers on cotton seeds are used as raw materials for paper making, artificial fibers, etc. Through such repeated utilization, the use value of oil extraction raw materials has been greatly improved, providing a large amount of raw materials for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, and creating a large amount of wealth for the country. According to the factory's annual cotton seed crushing volume, only oil extraction and cake production can create more than 9.2 million yuan of wealth, but after comprehensive utilization, it can be increased to more than 31 million yuan, an increase of more than two times.

    制?醛，造钾肥，提炼人造石油……
    武汉油厂一厂多能
    据新华社武汉电　武汉油厂职工在大搞原料综合利用，使产品品种由一种增加到十七种，实现了一厂多能，一物多用，一人多技，产值加番，成本降低。
    武汉油厂过去主要是榨炼食用植物油。从1958年大跃进起，这个厂开始向着现代油脂化学工厂的方向发展，大搞副产品综合利用。他们将主要原料棉籽榨过油和出过饼后的棉皮加以利用，生产化工原料?醛；剩下的渣，一部分处理成高级钾肥，一部分用来制电池活性炭和脱色活性炭；在提炼?醛中由蒸馏罐流出的废水，用来制成醋酸钠；把毛油精炼后的油脚，一部分交化工厂制造肥皂、甘油，一部分提炼脂肪酸、油酸和人造石油，还有一部分提炼成工业用油；油饼用来做液体味精；残渣还可以作饲料；棉籽上的短绒，做了造纸、人造纤维等的原料。经过这样反复利用，大大提高了榨油原料的使用价值，为化学工业和医药工业提供了大量原料，给国家创造了大量财富。根据这个厂全年榨的棉籽量计算，仅仅榨油、出饼，只能创造九百二十多万元财富，经过综合利用，可以提高到三千一百多万元，增加两倍多。
