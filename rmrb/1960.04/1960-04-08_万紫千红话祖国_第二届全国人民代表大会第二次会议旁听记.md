A Riot of Color Celebrates the Motherland
—Notes from Observing the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress
By Our Reporter

“Our nationwide continued leap forward and constant revolution are among the greatest historical facts of the 1960s. We do not like to exaggerate, and we dare not be complacent, but we should not lack self-confidence: in the grand chorus of the future progress of human history, our voice will be extremely powerful and loud.”

The writer Lao She praised the leap forward of the motherland with such enthusiastic words. On the 6th and 7th, the delegates used a large number of inspiring examples to praise: the various undertakings of our great motherland are truly a riot of color, magnificent and brilliant.

Small Power Stations Shine Brightly

Small power stations are known as the "night-shining pearls" of the countryside. In Henan, a mass movement to run power stations has been launched vigorously. They proposed "taking hydropower as the main source, small-scale as the main approach, community-run as the main method, indigenous methods as the main means, and serving production as the main goal," to extract electricity and power from water, fire, wind, and marsh gas.

In the first quarter of this year alone, the people of the province have built more than 2,300 small power stations, with a capacity equivalent to 20% of the total capacity of new power station equipment built in Henan Province in the past ten years. Including the power stations built by the masses in 1959, the province already has more than 5,500 small power stations with a capacity of more than 100,000 kilowatts. At present, small power stations are scattered all over the rural areas of the province, with 80% of the rural people's communes having their own power stations.

Xing Zhaotang, a delegate from Henan, described the grand occasion of these night-shining pearls shining everywhere in Henan Province in his written speech. The result of Henan Province's large-scale mass operation of power stations has saved a lot of labor and promoted the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production. According to statistics from Shenqiu, Puyang, Jiaxian, Fangcheng, and Xihua counties, more than 8,400 horsepower of electric and power were invested in fighting drought this spring, driving water-lifting machinery to irrigate more than 180,000 mu of wheat every day, saving more than 60,000 laborers. The electricity generated by more than 5,500 small power stations in the province can save more than one million laborers.

Small Modern Groups Are Infinitely Powerful

Just like the vigorous rise of small power stations in Henan Province, "small modern groups," "small indigenous groups" enterprises such as small blast furnaces, small coke ovens, small converters, small chemical plants, and other industries in various places have grown like mushrooms after a rain. These enterprises with unlimited vitality have shown extremely great power for accelerating the development of my country's national economy.

The following is a record of the achievements made by the chemical industry department in running "small modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" enterprises on a large scale, as introduced by Delegate Lu Huanzhang.

Before 1958, my country's chemical industry was concentrated in a few areas, and many places had no chemical industry at all. Since the Great Leap Forward, more than 20,000 chemical "small modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" have been established in various places, and the chemical industry has blossomed everywhere and has yielded fruitful results. In 1959, the total national chemical production value increased by 49% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and the rise of "small modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" enterprises was an important factor. Two years ago, many places knew very little about chemical production. After running "small modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" on a large scale, acid-alkali factories alone have trained 45,000 skilled operators.

Two years of practice have broken the mysterious view of running the chemical industry. "Small modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" enterprises can not only produce inorganic chemical products such as acids, alkalis, and chemical fertilizers, but also technically complex organic chemical products. Last year alone, the chemical industry "small modern groups" in eight provinces produced more than 130 kinds of organic chemical products, including new plastics, synthetic rubber, pesticides, rubber products, etc., which strongly supported the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. Moreover, because small enterprises are convenient for producing and testing at the same time, it is possible to create new production methods and enrich the technical experience of the chemical industry.

New Countryside Prospering in All Undertakings

Delegates from rural people's communes excitedly talked about in their speeches that the broad masses of their hometowns are working hard and skillfully to realize the agricultural development program ahead of schedule. This program, which is praised as the "guiding light," points out the great struggle goals to the people, encouraging 500 million farmers to continuously develop agriculture and actively build a new socialist countryside.

In order to meet the requirements put forward by the program, many people's communes have implemented a combination of industry and agriculture, taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, which is really thriving in all undertakings. The Malou People's Commune in Lushan County, Henan Province, where the famous labor model Su Dianxuan is located, achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery in 1959. They overcame an unprecedented hundred-day drought, making the autumn grain yield reach 529 jin per mu, and the average rice yield per mu reached 1,000 jin, completing the grain target set by the agricultural development program ahead of schedule. The average yield per mu of various economic crops such as cotton, oil, and tobacco has also increased greatly compared with 1958. Within one year, the commune built ten larger factories and twenty-two smaller factories, including machinery, cement, chemical fertilizer, and agricultural tool repair and assembly. These commune-run industries have greatly accelerated the technological transformation of agriculture. In animal husbandry, they firmly grasped pig raising. By January of this year, it had developed to more than 80,000 heads, averaging 1.11 heads per mu of land, an increase of more than nine times compared with 1958. A large amount of manure was accumulated, and the average amount of pig manure applied per mu of land increased from 1,510 jin to 7,000 jin.

We Will Surely Make the Jiuzhou River Water Flow Backwards

"Satellites can go to the sky, the earth can be dug through, what's difficult about moving mountains? As long as the determination is firm!"

This folk song, which reflects the revolutionary heroic spirit of our era and the people in transforming the world, is popular on the Leizhou Peninsula, the southernmost tip of our mainland. The Leizhou Peninsula is surrounded by the vast sea on three sides, but for thousands of years, it has been plagued by drought. More than half of the five million mu of arable land has become barren wasteland. People once thought: to make Leizhou not dry, the Jiuzhou River water must flow backwards. In the old society, this could only be a beautiful fantasy; today, it has become a reality. On May 15, 1958, the Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China announced the decision to build a canal. "Build a canal!" became the battle cry of the people of the entire peninsula. Men, women, old people, and children, carrying rice bags and tools, rushed to the construction site from dozens of miles away. In less than two years, twenty-two mountain tops were leveled, countless depressions and streams were filled, three "jie gua" reservoirs were built, and the capricious Jiuzhou River was cut off. The main canal project has been completed by more than 80%. Soon, the Leizhou Peninsula, historically known for its drought, will become a water network area, completely eliminating drought and awakening the ancient sleeping wilderness. The changes in the Leizhou Peninsula are indeed, as People's Delegate Zhao Guangju said: "It can very well summarize the style of our era and the people."

Red Flags Flying on the Grassland

On the vast grasslands of the motherland, the red flags of the people's communes have been raised high, and everywhere is a scene of joy and prosperity for both people and livestock.

"Only the people's communes can fundamentally change the backwardness of the pastoral economy and culture." Zaxi Wangxu, Deputy Governor of Qinghai Province, used the typical material of the Sujitan Commune to illustrate this truth at the meeting.

Sujitan is a commune composed of five ethnic groups: Tibetan, Mongolian, Han, Hui, and Tu. Its rapid transition from backwardness and poverty to prosperity is a microcosm of the Great Leap Forward of various ethnic minorities in our country. In the past, it was called "Poor Sujitan." More than 60 of the 100-plus herdsmen's families were forced to flee and wander around. By the time of liberation, only 89 households were left, and the vast majority were poor herdsmen. After liberation, under the care and leadership of the Party, people of all ethnic groups destroyed the feudal exploitation system and turned themselves over. After the establishment of the people's commune in 1958, the people of Sujitan were even more "gan zi dang tou (幹字當頭, work hard first)" and made great efforts in agricultural production. They realized the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, with animal husbandry as the main focus. They also established eight small factories for agricultural and animal husbandry machinery repair and assembly, and fur processing, turning the single animal husbandry economy into a diversified development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. In the first year of the commune's establishment, the herdsmen ended their nomadic life of living by water and grass for generations, realized settled grazing, and won a bumper harvest of 420 jin of grain per mu on average. Not only was grain self-sufficient, but also a large amount of feed was prepared for livestock. Animal husbandry production has progressed by leaps and bounds. In 1958, livestock increased by a net of 17%, and in 1959, it increased by a net of 20.2% compared with 1958. The lives of the commune members have improved, and every household has savings.

Ten Thousand People Cheer and Send Away the Plague God

Delegate Shen Qizhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, brought the good news of "sending away the plague god" to the conference. In areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent, the tragic scenes left over from history of "thousands of villages are desolate and people leave their excrement, and ten thousand households are deserted and ghosts sing" have disappeared forever. Who can not be excited and encouraged by the great victory in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis! For many years, this disease has been prevalent in 324 counties and cities in 12 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in the south, threatening the lives and health of 100 million people. In severely affected areas, many places that were originally densely populated and fertile have become wildernesses of "villages deserted for ten li, and white bones covered by three zhang of weeds." In recent years, especially after the Great Leap Forward in 1958, these areas, under the cordial care and leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, mobilized the whole people to eliminate schistosomiasis. More than 5.2 million patients have been treated, accounting for 78% of the total number of patients. Among them, about 3.6 million people have been cured. Since then, the face of the affected areas has undergone fundamental changes. In Fengtai Village, Xiangyang, Hunan Province, more than 160 people died of schistosomiasis in the ten years before liberation, and 21 households were wiped out. A folk song circulated there: "Fenghuangtai, Fenghuangtai, the mother does not give birth to a son, and the man is pregnant. Fertile land is not planted, there is little clothing and no food, and the wife does not come." Now, all the patients in this village have been treated, the weak have become strong, those who could not marry have formed families, barren land has been planted with crops, and 44 new houses have been built in the village. People sing: "Fenghuangtai, Fenghuangtai, the disease is eliminated, and happiness comes. The fields and gardens increase production, people increase their lifespan, and there is abundant clothing and food, and smiles are everywhere."

    万紫千红话祖国
    ——第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议旁听记
    本报记者
    “我们的全民继续跃进，不断革命，是二十世纪六十年代最伟大的历史事实之一。我们不喜夸张，更不敢自满，可是不应不自信：在今后人类历史前进曲的大合唱中，我们的声音是极其雄壮响亮的。”
    作家老舍这样热情奔放地歌颂着祖国的飞跃。6日和7日，代表们用大量激奋人心的事例来赞颂：我们伟大祖国的各项事业，真正是万紫千红，绚丽灿烂。
    小电站光芒万丈
    小电站被人们称作农村的“夜明珠”。在河南，一个全民办电的运动已经轰轰烈烈地展开。他们提出，“以水力为主、小型为主、社办为主、土法为主、服务生产为主”，要向水、火、风、沼（气）索取电力和动力。
    仅是今年第一季度，全省人民就办起了二千三百多处小电站，容量相当于河南省十年来新建电站设备总容量的20％。如果加上1959年群众兴办的电站，全省已经有小电站五千五百多处，容量达十万多瓩。目前，小电站已经在全省农村星罗棋布，遍地开花，80％的农村人民公社都有了自己的电站。
    来自河南的代表邢肇棠，在他的书面发言里，叙述了河南省这种夜明珠遍地放光的盛况。河南省大搞全民办电的结果，已经节省了大量劳动力，促进了工农业生产高速度发展。据沈丘、濮阳、郏县、方城、西华五个县的统计，今年春天投入抗旱的电力、动力就有八千四百多马力，带动提水机械每天浇麦十八万多亩，节约劳动力六万多个。全省五千五百多处小电站发出的电力，可节省劳动力一百多万人。
    小洋群威力无穷
    正像河南省小电站的蓬勃兴起一样，各地小高炉、小焦炉、小转炉、小化工厂以及其他行业的“小洋群”、“小土群”企业，雨后春笋般地成长起来了。这些具有无限生命力的企业，对于加速发展我国国民经济，已显示出极其巨大的威力。
    下面记述的，是卢焕章代表介绍的化学工业部门大办“小洋群”、“小土群”企业所取得的成果。
    1958年以前，我国的化学工业集中在少数几个地区，很多地方根本没有化学工业。大跃进以来，各地兴办了两万多个化工“小洋群”、“小土群”，化学工业已经遍地开花，并且结出了丰硕的果实。1959年，全国化工生产总值比大跃进的1958年增长了49％，其中“小洋群”、“小土群”企业的崛起，是一个重要因素。两年前，许多地方懂化工生产的人还很少，经过大办“小洋群”、“小土群”，仅是酸碱工厂，已经培养出四万五千名娴熟的操作人员。
    两年的实践，打破了办化学工业的神秘观点。“小洋群”、“小土群”企业，不但能够生产酸、碱、化学肥料等无机化工产品，就连技术比较复杂的有机化工产品，“小洋群”、“小土群”同样能生产。去年一年，仅仅八个省的化工“小洋群”就生产了一百三十多种有机化工产品，包括新型塑料、合成橡胶、农药、橡胶制品等，有力地支援了工农业大跃进。不仅如此，由于小型企业便于一边生产、一边试验，就有可能创造新的生产方法，丰富化学工业的技术经验。
    新农村百业兴旺
    来自农村人民公社的代表，在发言中兴奋地谈到，他们家乡的广大人民为着提前实现农业发展纲要，正在大干、巧干。这个被称颂为“指路明灯的纲要”，向人们指出了伟大的奋斗目标，鼓舞着五亿农民不断地发展农业，积极建设社会主义的新农村。
    为了适应纲要所提出的要求，很多人民公社实行工农业并举，以粮为纲，全面发展了农、林、牧、副、渔的多种经营，真是百业兴旺。著名劳模苏殿选所在的河南省鲁山县马楼人民公社，在1959年就取得了工农牧副渔业的全面大丰收。他们战胜了空前未有的百日大旱，使秋季粮食单产达到五百二十九斤，水稻平均亩产一千斤，提前完成了农业发展纲要规定的粮食指标。棉、油、烟等各种经济作物的平均亩产量也都比1958年有了很大增长。全社在一年之内，建起机械、水泥、化肥、农具修配等十个较大的工厂和二十二个小型工厂。这些社办工业，大大加速了农业的技术改造。在畜牧业中，他们狠狠地抓住了养猪，到今年1月已发展到八万多头，平均每亩地一点一一头，比1958年增加了九倍多，积攒下大量粪肥，平均每亩地施用的猪粪由一千五百一十斤增加到七千斤。
    定叫九洲江水倒流
    “卫星能上天，地球能挖穿，移山有何难？只要决心坚！”
    这首反映我们时代和人民改造世界的革命英雄气魄的民歌，流行在我国大陆最南端的雷州半岛上。雷州半岛，三面是茫茫的大海，但是几千年来，因为一直受干旱的困扰，五百万亩可耕地中，有一半以上成为荒凉的不毛之地。人们曾经想过：要叫雷州不干旱，必须九洲江水倒流。在旧社会，这只能是一个美丽的幻想；在今天，却变成了现实。1958年5月15日，中共湛江地委公布了兴建运河的决定。“修运河去！”成了全半岛人民的战斗口号。男人，女人，老人，少年，背上米袋，带着工具，从几十里外，奔向工地。在不到两年的时间里，削平了二十二座山头，填平了无数洼地溪流，建设了三个“结瓜”水库，腰斩了变化无常的九洲江，运河主道工程已经完成了80％以上。不久，历史上以干旱著称的雷州半岛，就将变成水网地区，根本消灭干旱，让亘古以来沉睡的荒原苏醒过来。雷州半岛的变迁，的确像人民代表赵光炬所说：“很能概括我们时代和人民的风貌。”
    草原上红旗飘扬
    在祖国辽阔的草原上，人民公社的红旗已经高高升起，到处是一片人畜两旺的欢乐景象。
    “只有人民公社，才能从根本上改变牧区经济、文化的落后面貌。”青海省副省长扎喜旺徐，在会上运用苏吉滩公社的典型材料，阐明了这个真理。
    苏吉滩，是一个由藏、蒙、汉、回、土五种民族组成的公社。它从落后、贫穷迅速地走上繁荣，正是我国各少数民族大跃进的缩影。过去，这里被人叫做“穷苏吉”，一百多户牧民就有六十多户被迫逃亡，四处飘流，到解放的时候，只留下八十九户，而绝大多数是贫苦牧民。解放后，在党的关怀和领导下，各族人民摧毁了封建剥削制度，翻了身。1958年成立人民公社以后，苏吉滩人民更是“干”字当头，大闹农业生产，以牧为主实现了农牧结合，还创办起农牧机具修配、皮毛加工等八个小型工厂，使单一的畜牧经济变成了工农牧业多种生产大发展。建社的第一年，牧民们就结束了世世代代逐水草而居的游牧生活，实现定居放牧，并且争得粮食平均亩产四百二十斤的大丰收，不仅粮食自给，还为牲畜准备下大量饲料。畜牧业生产更是突飞猛进，1958年牲畜净增17％，1959年又比1958年净增20.2％。社员生活提高了，家家户户有了存款。
    万民欢腾送瘟神
    中国医学科学院副院长沈其震代表，给大会带来了“送瘟神”的捷报。在血吸虫病流行的地区，历史上遗留下来的“千村薜苈人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌”的悲惨景象，已经永远消逝了。谁能不为防治血吸虫病的伟大胜利而欢欣鼓舞！多少年来，这种病流行在南方十二个省、市、自治区的三百二十四个县、市，威胁着一亿人民的生命和健康。在重疫区，有许多原来人烟稠密、土地肥沃的地方，曾经变成了“十里村庄无人烟，三丈蔓草掩白骨”的荒野。几年来，特别是1958年大跃进以后，这些地区在党和毛主席的亲切关怀和领导下，全民动手消灭血吸虫病，有五百二十多万病人得到了治疗，占患者总数的78％。其中约有三百六十多万人已经治愈。从此，疫区的面貌发生了根本的变化。湖南省湘阳凤台村，在解放前的十年间，全村有一百六十多人死于血吸虫病，死绝了二十一户。那里流传着一首民歌：“凤凰台，凤凰台，婆不生崽男怀胎，良田沃土无人种，少衣无食妻不来。”现在，这个村庄所有的病人都得到了治疗，病弱的人强壮了，不能结婚的成了家，荒地种上了庄稼，全村盖起四十四间新屋。人们唱着：“凤凰台，凤凰台，病害消除幸福来，田园增产人增寿，丰衣足食笑颜开。”
