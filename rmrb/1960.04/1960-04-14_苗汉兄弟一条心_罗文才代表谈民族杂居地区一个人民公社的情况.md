Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and will resolutely implement them in my work after this meeting.

Now, I will speak about the growth, strengthening, and consolidation of the Cultural People's Commune in Xuyong County, a region of mixed Miao and Han ethnicities, based on my observations during my visit to the commune before this conference.

The Cultural People's Commune in Xuyong County is located in a high-altitude mountainous area, 1,200 to 2,000 meters above sea level. It is a sparsely populated area covering 50 li in length and breadth, with barren soil, inhabited by both Miao and Han people. The entire commune has 16,400 mu of cultivated land, 1,631 households, and 7,568 people (1,589 agricultural households with 7,498 people), of which the Miao ethnicity accounts for 368 households and 1,774 people, representing 22.72% of the total population. Since the realization of the people's commune in 1958, it has brought infinite happiness and warmth to the Miao and Han people, significantly changing the face of this poor and backward mountainous area. Since then, a thriving and prosperous new scene has emerged everywhere, where Miao and Han brothers are of one heart, men and women, young and old, are of one mind, and industry, agriculture, and sideline occupations are all the same.

Due to the advantages of the people's commune, such as its large organizational scale and wide scope of activities ("large in scale and public in nature"), it can better coordinate the overall planning of production throughout the commune, fully mobilize and rationally organize the labor force to carry out thorough reforms in agricultural technology in the mountainous areas, and more effectively overcome all natural disasters. In the spring of 1959, continuous rain lasted for two months, and the entire commune suffered from an unusually low temperature (averaging around eight degrees), causing widespread phenomena such as seedling decay and stunted growth. Through the unified allocation of labor by the commune and the organization of large-scale operations, effective measures such as shallow water irrigation and the application of heating fertilizers were widely adopted, thus quickly overcoming the attack of low temperatures and ensuring the completion of transplanting tasks according to the season and quality requirements. The Xingfu Management District used only 350 man-days to completely ditch and drain 40 mu of cold paddy fields that had suffered severely from low temperatures, not only overcoming the natural disaster but also achieving the miracle of increasing grain production by 9,600 jin compared to 1957.

Since the summer of 1959, the entire commune has suffered from an unprecedented severe drought in nearly forty years. Under the unified leadership of the commune's Party committee, the hardworking and courageous Miao and Han people loudly put forward the battle cry of "We will not retreat until the drought is eliminated," and immediately organized a strong drought resistance team to wage a tenacious struggle against the drought. The Xingfu Management District, through six days and nights of battle, pumped water to irrigate 312 mu of farmland and built 455 dams, irrigating all the cracked fields and ensuring the normal growth of grain crops. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the Miao and Han people and their selfless labor, another significant increase and bumper harvest of grain production were achieved in 1959. The Hongou Management District (a Miao ethnic community) even created a new record of an average yield of more than 800 jin of corn per mu. On this basis, the entire commune successfully and exceeded the purchase target of 2.4 million jin (the original allocation was 2.35 million jin).

Since the Great Leap Forward, especially after the people's commune, the commune has also undergone fundamental changes in terms of cropping systems and techniques. In the past, people always believed that seedlings (including rice and sweet potatoes) could not be cultivated in the high mountains, and sweet potatoes were not produced (large-scale planting has gradually occurred since liberation). Before the establishment of the people's commune in 1958, the entire commune spent 45,000 yuan to import 150,000 jin of sweet potato vines from other places, causing great losses in terms of financial resources, manpower, and season. In 1959, the commune sent special personnel to "learn from experience" in other places, achieving self-cultivation and self-planting of seedlings. The old practice of renting fields downstream to "scatter guest seedlings," which had been customary for many years, was also broken after 1958. All 170,000 jin of rice seeds in the commune were cultivated locally, not only ensuring timely transplanting but also saving 40,500 yuan in expenses and 20,100 man-days. Due to the promotion of experience in seedling cultivation in high-altitude mountainous areas, agricultural investment was reduced by 74%, greatly increasing the income of the commune and its members.

Since the anti-rightist struggle, the drive to boost morale, the socialist education movement, and the in-depth implementation of the policy of "taking grain as the key link and developing diversified operations in an all-round way," the Miao and Han commune members have become even more enthusiastic about production. They have unanimously and actively responded to the provincial Party committee's measures to complete grain targets, namely, "seizing early planting, seizing diversified planting, and seizing high yields," and have launched a massive agricultural all-round bumper harvest movement centered on "1,000 jin of rice, 1,000 jin of corn, and 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes," vowing to fight for a total grain output of 10.06 million jin for the entire commune, thus greatly advancing production. The sowing season has been advanced by about one month compared to previous years. As of now, 6,500 dan of fields in the commune have completed three ploughings and three harrows, and 3,500 dan have completed four ploughings and four harrows (after the Spring Festival in 1958, there were still 3,500 dan of fields that had not been ploughed). The 8,300 mu of corn that has been sown (the planned sowing area is 20,000 mu) and the 8,700 mu of spring crops have all been weeded and top-dressed four times, and they are now growing well and are expected to have a good harvest (spring crops: 2,500 mu were planted in 1958, yielding 120,000 jin; 8,700 mu were planted in the winter of 1959, and it is expected to yield more than 1.2 million jin).

The Cultural Commune is also extremely rich in underground mineral resources and wild resources. After the establishment of the people's commune, these resources have been rapidly developed, utilized, and developed. In 1959, various commune-run industries, handicrafts, sideline occupations, and diversified operations also made great leaps forward. The total income of industry, agriculture, and diversified operations for the whole year increased by 26.1% on the basis of 283,250 yuan in 1958. The average income of each commune member also increased by more than 50% compared to 1957. The Yuanshilou Management District combined agriculture with large-scale diversified operations, and its total output value from January to June 1959 reached more than 4,500 yuan. Currently, there are 27 rubber roasting factories in the commune, which can produce 8,400 jin per month, earning 4,650 yuan. The commune has also decided to expand to 120 people, with an estimated monthly income of more than 7,000 yuan. In addition to some other income, it can guarantee that each commune member receives a monthly wage of 3 yuan.

Due to the all-round development of industry, agriculture, and diversified operations, the accumulation of the commune and the income of the commune members have greatly increased. According to the statistics of the commune's supply and marketing cooperative, the total sales of living materials and daily necessities in the first half of 1959 reached 123,841 yuan, an increase of more than 250% compared to the same period in 1958. It is also precisely because of the realization and consolidation of the people's commune and the great development of various productions that the all-round leap forward of collective welfare undertakings has been powerfully promoted. After the establishment of the people's commune, 96 public canteens, kindergartens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, and rural medical and health organizations were established one after another like mushrooms after rain. The establishment of public canteens not only liberated more than 1,000 women's labor force to invest in various production battles, but more importantly, it thoroughly solved the living burden of worrying about food and clothing for farmers for thousands of years, providing extremely reliable social insurance for many poor farmers. Commune member Wang Shuyun (Miao), with a family of five, only had one main labor force. In the past, he always relied on government loans, grain loans, and relief, and had to repay the agricultural cooperative for food grain every year. After the commune implemented the system of half-supply and half-wage, the situation changed. The whole family ate in the public canteen, the children entered the kindergarten or nursery, the couple worked hard every day, and received a monthly salary. In 1959, in addition to purchasing clothing, they also had 46 yuan in the bank. He gratefully said to everyone: "The people's commune is really a happy nest. We people with heavy burdens will never have to worry about food and clothing again."

The public canteen also promoted the development of production with its unparalleled superiority and brought countless benefits to the commune members. The commune members called it a flower of happiness and a lifeline. In the struggle between the two roads, its vitality was further demonstrated. Since May 1959, the Miao and Han commune members have unanimously shown their active actions to safeguard collective interests, so that 65 canteens have not been dissolved and have been consolidated. For example, in the Hongou Management District, a Miao community with 115 households and 521 people, Miao Wang Jinwu discussed with the masses for five evenings to unify their thinking and resolutely expressed their determination to run the canteen well. Miao commune member Yang Shuyun said: "Chairman Mao has led us to embark on the socialist road. We must run the canteen well. Even if we only have a broken bowl, I will eat in the canteen." After this canteen was consolidated, it did set up a red flag. In order to better arrange their lives, they seized vegetables. They planted 26 jin of radish seeds alone, yielding more than 50,000 jin. In addition to meeting the needs of the commune members, they also sold more than 2,100 jin, earning more than 80 yuan, and adding iron pots and various cooking utensils. Not only that, the 201 pigs raised collectively by the team also grew well, overfulfilling the upward transfer task (the original allocation was 50 heads, and 68 heads were completed).

With the realization of the people's commune and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the socialist ethnic relations of unity, mutual assistance, friendly cooperation, common development, and common prosperity between the Miao and Han nationalities have been further consolidated and developed, and have become increasingly profound and extensive. Before liberation, due to the incitement of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Miao and Han people had long distrusted each other, and disputes such as scolding and fighting often occurred. After liberation, under the brilliant light of the great ethnic equality and unity policy of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, ethnic estrangement had been eliminated, and friendly and fraternal relations had been established. However, due to the small scope of agricultural cooperatives, people's ideological awareness was only trapped in small circles. The establishment of the people's commune immediately became a powerful weapon to strengthen ethnic unity and cooperation and promote the common development and prosperity of all ethnic groups, promoting the common leap forward of all ethnic groups.

On the basis of improving the socialist and communist ideological awareness of the Miao people, in order to ensure a greater and sustained leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and further promote unity among ethnic groups, the Miao people consciously made appropriate reforms to certain customs. For example, the Miao people's traditional Mountain Gathering Festival, which is held regularly every year from the 13th to the 15th day of the first lunar month when agricultural work is relatively tense, has been automatically changed to hold a joint celebration during the Spring Festival holiday since 1958. According to Baowa in the Cultural Commune (the most lively place for mountain gathering in the county), more than 30,000 laborers can be saved (estimated to be more than 50,000 in the whole county) and put into the front line of agricultural production. In this way, the Miao people's custom of mountain gathering is not only fully developed under the support and leadership of the Party and the government, but more importantly, it serves production and promotes production.

Under the excellent situation of the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune, the great unity and cooperation of the Miao and Han people have become a social fashion. In the winter of 1958, not long after the establishment of the people's commune, the two ethnic commune members worked together to transform Shenjia Mountain, reclaiming 1,853 mu of wasteland, opening up 45 mu of fields, and converting 228 mu of soil into fields in two months, and also changing 53 river courses and transforming 393 large and small hills, turning the barren and poor mountains into granaries. The Han team 1 of the former Jiugou Management District sent most of its labor force to the iron-smelting front. Due to the lack of labor, the purchase task could not be completed on schedule. The Miao team 2 immediately sent people to help, completing the task in three days of blitz. In the spring of 1959, the Han teams 1 and 3 also sent more than 80 cattle workers to support team 2, and in just one day, they completely turned over 48 mu of wasteland overgrown with weeds and planted corn in time. The Miao team 2 also often helped the Han people with production. In the summer of 1959, due to the prolonged drought, the paddy fields in the Xingfu Management District were about to crack. Wang Guoqing (Miao), the captain of the Hongou Management District, and Ruan Shaoqing (Han), the warehouse keeper, discussed together and immediately counted all the water-lifting tools and sent 148 people and 18 cattle to the Xingfu Management District to fight the drought before dawn. They fought hard for a day and drove out 87 mu of dry land. Examples of such communist style of "I for everyone, everyone for me" are countless.

The profound changes in the Cultural Commune in the past year, the achievements made by the Miao and Han people working together under the leadership of the Party (the above is only a part), are only a microcosm of the 43 people's communes in Xuyong County. How much more are the unparalleled superiority and powerful power of the people's commune and the happiness it brings to the Miao and Han people! This is a great victory for the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, and a great victory for the Party's ethnic policy. Now, the Miao and Han people of the whole county are holding high these three red flags, and under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, they are drumming up greater revolutionary enthusiasm and striving to win greater victories in 1960.

Please correct me if the above remarks are inappropriate.

专栏：

    苗汉兄弟一条心
    罗文才代表谈民族杂居地区一个人民公社的情况主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念副总理的报告，并在会后工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    现在我仅就在大会前视察叙永县文化人民公社，即人民公社在苗、汉族杂居地区的成长、壮大和巩固的情况作如下发言。
    叙永县文化人民公社，位于拔海一千二至二千米的高寒山区，是一个纵横五十华里，地广人稀，土质贫瘠，苗、汉族杂居的地区，全公社共有田土面积一万六千四百亩，一千六百三十一户，七千五百六十八人（农业户有一千五百八十九户，七千四百九十八人），其中：苗族三百六十八户，一千七百七十四人，占总人口的22.72％。1958年实现了人民公社化以后，给苗、汉两族人民带来了无限的幸福和温暖，使这个贫穷、落后的山区面貌，有了显著的改变。从此，到处出现了苗汉兄弟一条心，男女老幼一股劲，工农副业一个样的兴旺，欣欣向荣的崭新景象。
    由于人民公社具有组织规模大，活动范围广等“一大二公”的优点，因此，它能更好地统一筹划全社生产和充分动员与合理组织劳动力，进行山区的农业技术的彻底改革，并更能有效地战胜一切自然灾害。1959年春天，这里阴雨连绵两个月，全社遭受到了历年来少有的低温（平均八度左右）的侵袭，使秧苗普遍发生化苗、坐兜等现象。通过公社统一调配劳动力，组织大兵团作战，普遍采取浅水灌溉，施热性肥料等有效措施，因此迅速地战胜了低温的袭击，保证了按季节、按质量的完成了栽插任务。兴伏管区仅用三百五十个人工，就将四十亩遭受低温严重的冷水田全部开沟、排水，不仅战胜自然灾害，而且获得了较1957年增产粮食九千六百斤的奇迹。
    1959年入夏以来，全社遭受到了近四十年来从所未有的特大干旱，勤劳勇敢的苗汉两族人民，在公社党委的统一领导下，响亮地提出了“旱象不灭，决不收兵”的战斗口号，立即组织了一支强大的抗旱队伍，向干旱进行了顽强的斗争。兴伏管区通过六个昼夜的战斗，即车水灌田三百一十二亩，扎堰沟四百五十五处，把所有的裂口田全部灌上了水，保证了粮食作物的正常生长。由于苗、汉两族人民的一致努力，忘我劳动，又夺取了1959年粮食产量的大增产、大丰收。红藕管区（苗族聚居地区）还创造了玉米平均亩产八百多斤新的纪录。在此基础上，全公社胜利和超额完成了征购任务二百四十万斤（原分配数为二百三十五万斤）。
    大跃进，特别是人民公社化以后，该社在耕作制度和技术等方面也同样有了根本的改变。过去人们总认为高山不能育秧（包括水稻和红苕），不产红苕（解放后已逐步有大面积的种植），未建立人民公社的1958年，全社还以四万五千元钱向外地调来红苕藤十五万斤，在财力、人力、季节等方面都造成了很大损失。1959年，公社即派了专人到外地“取经”，做到了自育秧自栽种。历年都习惯在坝下租田“撒客秧”的陈规，在1958年以来也被打破了，全社十七万斤稻谷种子全是就地培育，不仅保证了能按时栽插，而且还节约了开支四万零五百元，节约劳力二万零一百个。由于在高寒山区的育秧等经验的推广，因而节约了农业投资74％，大大的增加了公社和社员的收入。
    通过反右倾、鼓干劲和社会主义教育运动以及深入贯彻“以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营”的方针以来，全社苗、汉族社员的生产劲头更大了，他们一致积极地响应了省委提出完成粮食指标的措施“抓早种、抓多种、抓高产”的号召，开展了声势浩大的“千斤水稻、千斤玉米、万斤红苕”为中心的农业全面大丰收运动，誓为夺取全社粮食一千零六十万斤而战，从而使生产有了很大的进展，播种季节都比往年提前一月左右。截至目前为止，全社已有田六千五百石完成了三犁三耙，三千五百石完成了四犁四耙（1958年春节后尚有田面积三千五百石未犁板田）；玉米已播种的八千三百亩（预计播种二万亩）八千七百亩小春，也全做到了四薅四追，现在生长良好，可望丰收（小春：1958年种二千五百亩，收入十二万斤，1959年冬种八千七百亩，预计可收一百二十万斤以上）。
    文化公社的地下矿产和野生五宝等物产资源也是极为丰富的。人民公社后，这些资源迅速的得到了开发、利用和发展。1959年内各种社办工业、手工业、副业以及多种经营等方面同样有了极大的跃进，全年工、农业和多种经营的总收入即在1958年二十八万三千二百五十元的基础上增加了26.1％，每个社员平均收入也较1957年增加一倍半以上。原石留管区结合了农业大搞多种经营，1959年1至6月份的总产值即达四千五百多元。目前全社有烤胶厂二十七个，一个月可搞八千四百斤，收入四千六百五十元，公社还决定扩大到一百二十人，每月预计收入七千多元，加上部分其他收入，可以保证每个社员每月发工资三元。
    由于工、农业和多种经营的全面大发展，大大的增加了公社的积累和社员的收入。据公社供销商店的统计，1959年上半年的生活资料和日用百货品的销售总额达十二万三千八百四十一元，比1958年同期增长两倍半以上。也正是由于人民公社的实现和巩固以及各种生产的大发展，从而有力地促进了集体福利事业的全面跃进。人民公社成立后，就办起了公共食堂九十六个，幼儿园、托儿所、敬老院、农村医疗保健组织等，也像雨后春笋一般的先后兴建起来。公共食堂的成立，不仅解放了一千多个妇女劳动力投入了各种生产战斗，更重要的是彻底解决了几千年来农民愁穿愁吃的生活负担，使许多贫苦农户有了极为可靠的社会保险。社员王树云（苗），全家五口人，只有主劳力一个，过去，一向是依靠政府贷款、贷粮、发救济，每年还得向农业社倒补口粮款。公社实行了半供给半工资制以后，情况改变了，全家在公共食堂吃饭，孩子们都进了幼儿园或托儿所，夫妻天天出工干活，每月还领工资，1959年除了购制衣物等外，银行里还有存款四十六元。他逢人便感激的说：“人民公社真是幸福窝，我们这些拖累重的人户，从此也不再愁吃愁穿了。”
    公共食堂还以它无比的优越性，促进了生产的发展，为社员带来了说不完的好处，社员们称它为幸福花、命根子。在两条道路的斗争中，更显示出了它的生命力。1959年5月份以来，苗、汉族社员一致表现了积极维护集体利益的行动，使六十五个食堂没有解散，一直巩固下来。如苗族聚居的一百一十五户五百二十一人的红藕管区，苗族王金武通过五个晚上的会议与群众商量，统一了思想认识，一直坚决表示要把食堂办好。苗族社员杨树云说：“毛主席领导我们已经开始走上了社会主义道路，一定要把食堂办好，就是只有一只破碗，我也要在食堂里吃饭”。这个食堂巩固下来以后，的确树立了一面红旗，他们为了更好地安排好生活，大抓了蔬菜，单是萝卜种就种下了二十六斤，收入五万斤以上，除满足社员需用外，还卖了二千一百多斤，得钱八十多元，添制了铁锅和各种炊事工具。不仅如此，该队坚持集体饲养的二百零一头生猪也长得很好，超额完成了上调任务（原分配五十头，完成六十八头）。
    随着人民公社化的实现和工农业生产的大跃进，苗、汉两族之间的团结互助、友爱合作、共同发展、共同繁荣的社会主义民族关系，有了更大的新的巩固和发展，而且日加深刻和广泛。解放前，由于国民党反动派的挑拨离间，苗、汉两族人民长期互不信任，打骂等纠纷也经常有所发生，解放后，在党中央和毛主席的伟大的民族平等、团结政策的光辉照耀下，民族隔阂已经消除，并建立了友谊团结兄弟般的关系，但由于农业社的范围小，人们的思想意识也只有陷在小圈里，人民公社的建立，它立刻成了加强民族团结合作、促进各民族共同发展和繁荣的有力武器，推动了各民族的共同跃进。
    在苗族人民社会主义、共产主义思想觉悟提高的基础上，为了保证工、农业生产的更大持续跃进和进一步促进民族间的团结，苗族人民自觉地对某些风俗习惯加以适当的改革。如苗族历史传统的采山节，每年都定期在农活较为紧张的阴历正月13至15日进行，自1958年起，苗族人民自动地把它改在春节放假期间举行联欢，单据文化公社的宝瓦（全县采山最热闹的地方）就可节约劳动力三万多个（以全县计约五万个以上）投入了农业生产第一线。这样，苗族采山的风俗习惯，不仅在党和政府的支持和领导下得到充分的发扬，而更重要的是为生产服务，促进了生产。
    在大跃进和人民公社的优异形势下，苗汉人民的大团结、大协作，已成为社会风尚。人民公社刚建立不久的1958年冬天，两族社员即同心协力的改造沈家山，两个月就开垦了荒地一千八百五十三亩，开田四十五亩，土变田二百二十八亩，并改河道五十三处，改造大小山头三百九十三个，使多年的荒芜穷山变成了粮仓。原九曲管区汉族一队，大部分劳力开赴炼铁前线去了，由于劳力差，征购任务不能按期完成，苗族二队即马上派人去帮忙，突击三天完成了任务。1959年春天，汉族的一、三队还抽出了八十多个牛工去支援二队，仅一天的时间，就把一片野草丛生的四十八亩荒土全部翻完，及时种上了包谷。苗族二队也经常帮助汉族搞生产。1959年夏天，由于久旱，眼看兴伏管区的水田已开裂，红藕管区大队长王国清（苗）和保管员阮绍清（汉）共同商量好后，立即清点好各种提水工具，派出一百四十八个人和十八头牛，天不亮即奔赴兴伏管区抗旱。他们奋战一天，就赶出干田八十七亩。像这样“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义风格的事例是不胜枚举的。
    文化公社一年来的深刻变化，苗汉两族人民同心协力在党的领导下取得了这些成绩（以上所述只是一部分），只不过是叙永县四十三个人民公社的一个缩影，而人民公社的无比优越性和强大的威力以及他为苗、汉族人民带来的幸福何况只这一点呢！这是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利，是党的民族政策的伟大胜利。现在全县苗汉两族人民正在高举这三面红旗，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，鼓足更大的革命干劲，为夺取1960年更大的胜利而奋勇前进。
    以上发言，是否恰当，请予指正。
