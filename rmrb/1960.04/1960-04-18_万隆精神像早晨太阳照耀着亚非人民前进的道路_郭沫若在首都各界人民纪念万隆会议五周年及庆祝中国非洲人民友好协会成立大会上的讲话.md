Comrades, friends:
Today, people from all walks of life in our capital are gathering here solemnly to warmly celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference, to celebrate the series of significant victories achieved by the Asian and African people in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism over the past five years, and also to warmly celebrate the establishment of the Chinese-African People’s Friendship Association.
Five years ago, the Bandung Conference, attended by leaders and politicians from twenty-nine Asian and African countries, was a conference of great historical significance. This conference marked a new stage in the struggle of 1.7 billion Asian and African people to unite against imperialism and to strive for and safeguard national independence. The Bandung spirit, characterized by unity against imperialism, has had a profound impact not only on Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but also on other regions of the world.
Since the Bandung Conference, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, inspired by the Bandung spirit, have launched a powerful impact on imperialism and the colonial system, and have achieved a series of brilliant victories.
Since the Bandung Conference, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, under the call and encouragement of the Bandung spirit, have launched a powerful impact on imperialism and the colonial system, and have achieved a series of brilliant victories. The national democratic movements of the Asian countries have developed more deeply. In the nationalistic countries that have already achieved independence, the broad masses of the people are increasingly demanding the pursuit of a peaceful and neutral policy based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and have carried out unremitting struggles to safeguard national independence and oppose the imperialist policies of aggression and war. Especially with the strong support of the socialist camp and the people of the world, the victory of the Egyptian people in smashing the armed aggression of British and French imperialism, the victory of the national revolution of the Iraqi people, and the victory of the Arab people in repelling the armed intervention of U.S. and British imperialism have severely hit the imperialist policy of aggression in the Middle East and Near East, and have powerfully encouraged the national liberation movement in the Asian and African regions.
Over the past five years, the African people have generally awakened. The flames of the struggle of the people of African countries against imperialism and for national independence have been burning everywhere. The colonial system of imperialism in Africa has been fundamentally shaken. The face of Africa is undergoing tremendous and profound changes. Currently, among the fifty-nine countries and regions in Africa, eleven countries have achieved independence. Under the situation of the vigorous development of the national independence movement, imperialism has been forced to agree that six countries, including Togo, Madagascar, Congo, Somaliland, Nigeria, and the Mali Federation, will declare their independence in 1960. The people of some African countries that have already achieved independence are still carrying out unremitting struggles to eliminate foreign military bases and safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The heroic Algerian people have always persisted in the armed struggle against the suppression of the French colonial army, and have achieved the great victory of annihilating more than 100,000 enemies and liberating two-thirds of the territory in the past five years. The Cameroonian people are also waging a tenacious struggle to demand the withdrawal of the French aggressor troops and the realization of the complete independence of their motherland. At present, in West Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, and South Africa, the struggles of the people in Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, Tanganyika, Uganda, Kenya, Congo, Ruanda-Urundi, Somaliland, Zanzibar, Angola, and other places against colonialism and for national independence are developing day by day. The South African people have been unyieldingly carrying out a long-term struggle against racial discrimination and for basic human rights and freedoms. Recently, they have been heroically resisting the barbaric suppression and bloody massacre by the South African Federal authorities. The just struggle of the South African people is winning increasing sympathy and support from the Asian and African people and the people of the world. Now, the struggles of various regions and nationalities in Africa for national liberation are rising like a storm, and are gradually converging into a huge torrent of national revolution. Their struggles rise one after another, cooperate with each other, and influence each other, making imperialism exhausted to cope with. The African independence movement has entered a new stage, and the extensiveness of the masses and the rapidity of development are unprecedented in African history. The day is not far off when the great African people will become the masters of the African continent again, and the complete and thorough collapse of the imperialist colonial system in Africa is becoming increasingly imminent.
The Bandung Conference laid the foundation for the unity and cooperation of the Asian and African people. With the vigorous development of the Asian and African national independence movement, the mutual support and friendly cooperation of the people of Asian and African countries in the common struggle is also increasing day by day.
The series of victories achieved by the Asian and African people in the national liberation struggle have seriously thwarted the imperialist activities of aggression and expansion in the Asian and African regions, disrupted the imperialist plans and deployments to launch wars, and made significant contributions to the cause of safeguarding world peace. Facts have proved that the struggle of the Asian and African people to strive for and safeguard national independence is an important component of the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and for safeguarding world peace.
The Bandung Conference laid the foundation for the unity and cooperation of the Asian and African people. With the vigorous development of the Asian and African national independence movement, the mutual support and friendly cooperation of the people of Asian and African countries in the common struggle is also increasing day by day. Over the past five years, the friendly contacts between leaders of Asian and African countries have been increasing, and trade and cultural exchanges between countries have also developed rapidly. Following the Bandung Conference, the First Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held at the turn of 1957 and 1958, the All-African People's Conference held in 1958, the Conference of Independent African States, and a series of important international conferences of Asian and African youth, students, women, writers, etc. held during this period, all inherited and further promoted the "Bandung Spirit," strengthened the unity and cooperation of the Asian and African people in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The Second Asian- African People's Solidarity Conference recently held in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, has been successfully concluded. The Chinese people warmly welcome and support the resolutions adopted by the conference. We firmly believe that the convening of the conference and the resolutions adopted will further consolidate and develop the friendly unity of the Asian and African people in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism, further encourage and promote the victorious advance of the African national independence movement, and will promote the struggle of the African people for national independence to enter a higher stage of development.
The Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the just struggle of the African people. The common tasks of opposing imperialism, safeguarding world peace, and developing national economies closely link the Chinese people and the African people together. Today, we are very pleased to solemnly celebrate the official establishment of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association here. The establishment of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association will surely further strengthen and develop the militant friendship between the Chinese people and the African people, and make new and greater contributions to the common cause and struggle of the Asian and African people.
The imperialist colonial system is facing the final stage of collapse. However, imperialism has not abandoned its colonial policies. At present, they are provoking dissension everywhere, trying every means to undermine the unity of the Asian and African people.
Comrades, friends! The imperialist colonial system is facing the final stage of collapse. However, imperialism has not abandoned its colonial policies. The closer imperialism gets to death, the more it will carry out desperate struggles. At present, imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is continuing to implement its policies of war and aggression, stepping up its arms race and war preparations, frantically developing missile weapons, establishing military bases everywhere, and making every effort to strengthen aggressive military blocs. In the Middle East and Near East, the United States is using the Central Treaty Organization and Israel to intensify its military threats and subversive activities against Arab countries. In Indochina, the United States has consistently undermined the Geneva Accords, obstructed the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and is plotting to expand the civil war in Laos. In the Far East, the United States is still赖[lai: rely on] in South Korea, obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, and even openly launching "Matador" missiles in South Korea, carrying out new provocations against peace in Korea and the Far East. The United States still occupies our territory of Taiwan and continues to violate our territorial waters and airspace. It is particularly important to point out that while U.S. imperialism is stepping up the arming of West Germany in Europe, it is also making every effort to support Japanese militarism in the East, and has signed an aggressive new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" with the Kishi Nobusuke government, making Japan once again a source of war danger. This not only threatens the security of Asia and Africa, but also threatens the security of the people of the world. At present, the broad masses of the Japanese people are launching one massive national movement after another to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance and oppose the revival of Japanese militarism. We firmly believe that the heroic struggle of the Japanese people will surely achieve final victory. To smash the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to plot new aggression and war in Asia is not only the task of the Japanese people, but also the common task of the people of Asian countries and the people of the world. The Chinese people resolutely support the struggle of the Japanese people, and together with the Japanese people, the people of Asian and African countries, and the people of the world, will jointly strive to completely smash the new conspiracy of aggression and war by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and ensure peace in Asia and the world.
In Africa, U.S. imperialism is actively supporting the old colonial countries in implementing racial discrimination policies and carrying out bloody massacres against the people of South Africa and Africa, helping French colonialists suppress the people of Algeria and Cameroon, helping Belgian colonialists suppress the people of the Congo, and establishing military bases and stationing armed forces on the territory of many African countries, preparing to carry out direct armed suppression of the African people when necessary. This new type of colonialist, U.S. imperialism, is waving the banner of peace, putting on a disguise of "sympathy" for African independence, and actively infiltrating the African continent in the name of providing so-called "aid." Facts have proved that U.S. imperialism is not only the number one enemy of the Asian people today, but also the most dangerous enemy of the African people.
Imperialism clearly knows that the unity of the Asian and African people is a serious obstacle to their aggression and expansion in the Asian and African regions and to maintaining colonial rule. Therefore, they are provoking dissension everywhere, spreading discord, and trying every means to undermine this unity, so that Asian and African countries are isolated from each other, in order to achieve the goal of defeating them one by one and dividing and ruling them. In the past year, imperialism, led by the United States, has spared no effort to undermine the friendship between China and certain Asian and African countries. They have gathered a small handful of reactionary forces, repeatedly launched anti-China waves, and tried their best to undermine the Bandung spirit and the Five Principles, on the one hand, clamoring that the Five Principles and the Bandung spirit are "outdated" and "withered"; on the other hand, clamoring that the Five Principles and the Bandung spirit have been "abandoned" and "buried." However, the Bandung spirit and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence cannot be distorted, and the unity and cooperation of the Asian and African people on this basis cannot be undermined. The Asian and African people deeply understand that they have a thousand and ten thousand reasons to unite and support each other, and there is no reason to move towards division and confrontation. The imperialist conspiracy to undermine Asian-African unity is bound to go against their own wishes. Facts have proved that what is outdated and withered is none other than imperialism and colonialism. They have long been abandoned by the Asian and African people and the people of the world, and will soon be quickly, comprehensively, thoroughly, and forever buried.
China is a participant in the Bandung Conference and one of the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China has always been loyal to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit, and loyal to the cause of opposing imperialism and safeguarding world peace.
China is a participant in the Bandung Conference and one of the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese people and the people of other Asian and African countries have a common experience of being persecuted by colonialism for a long time, and have the common task of opposing imperialism, opposing colonialism, and safeguarding world peace. Therefore, the Chinese people and the people of Asian and African countries naturally have a deep desire for sympathy and mutual support. For many years, our people have given as much support as possible to every struggle of the people of Asian and African countries to strive for and safeguard national independence. At the same time, the people of Asian and African countries have also powerfully supported the Chinese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Socialist China has always been loyal to the cause of opposing imperialism and safeguarding world peace, and loyal to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit. China and Asian and African countries have further developed friendly and cooperative relations on the basis of the Five Principles and the Bandung spirit. It should be particularly pointed out that in January this year, China and Myanmar signed the Sino-Myanmar Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the Sino-Myanmar Agreement on Boundary Issues. In March this year, China and Nepal signed the Sino-Nepal Agreement on Boundary Issues. These mark that the friendly relations between China and these countries have entered a new stage, setting a new example for the friendly cooperation and harmonious coexistence of Asian and African countries. This is another major victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit, and it is also another heavy failure for the imperialists and reactionaries who are hostile to Asian-African unity and hostile to our country's peaceful construction. At present, our Premier Zhou Enlai, representing our people, is paying friendly visits to Myanmar and will soon go to India, Nepal and other countries. We are sincere and we firmly believe that this visit will make new and significant contributions to the friendly cooperation between the Asian and African people.
Comrades, friends! The current situation is unprecedentedly favorable for the struggle of the Asian and African people against colonialism and for national independence. The light of the Bandung spirit, like the morning sun, illuminates the path forward for the Asian and African people, while imperialism and colonialism are already declining and dying. The just cause of the Asian and African people has the support of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the support of all progressive forces and peace-loving people in the world. As long as we further unite and unremittingly carry out the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, our cause of striving for and safeguarding national independence will achieve greater and more brilliant victories. Let the people of Asian and African countries unite more closely, hold high the banner of the Bandung spirit, safeguard national independence, safeguard world peace, and bury imperialism and colonialism quickly, comprehensively, thoroughly and forever!
Down with imperialism and colonialism!
Long live the Bandung spirit!
Long live the friendly unity of the Chinese and African people!
Long live the great unity of the Asian and African people!
Long live the great unity of the people of the world!
Long live world peace!

### 万隆精神像早晨太阳照耀着亚非人民前进的道路  郭沫若在首都各界人民纪念万隆会议五周年及庆祝中国非洲人民友好协会成立大会上的讲话

    万隆精神像早晨太阳照耀着亚非人民前进的道路
    郭沫若在首都各界人民纪念万隆会议五周年及庆祝中国非洲人民友好协会成立大会上的讲话同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们首都各界人民在这里隆重集会，热烈庆祝万隆会议五周年，庆祝五年来亚非人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中所取得的一系列重大胜利，同时也热烈庆祝中国非洲人民友好协会的成立。
    五年以前，有二十九个亚非国家的领导人和政治家参加的万隆会议是一次具有重大历史意义的会议。这次会议标志着亚非十七亿人民的团结、反对帝国主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争进入了一个新的阶段。以团结反帝为特征的万隆精神，不仅对亚洲、非洲，而且对拉丁美洲和世界其他地区也都发生了极其深远的影响。
    万隆会议后的五年以来，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民，在万隆精神的鼓舞下，向帝国主义和殖民制度发动了强大的冲击，并且取得了一系列的辉煌的胜利
    万隆会议后的五年以来，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民，在万隆精神的号召和鼓舞下，向帝国主义和殖民制度发动了强大的冲击，并且取得了一系列的辉煌的胜利。亚洲各国人民民族民主运动有了更加深入的发展。在已经取得了独立的民族主义国家中，广大人民日益要求奉行以和平共处五项原则为基础的和平中立政策，并为维护民族独立、反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策进行了坚持不懈的斗争。特别是在社会主义阵营和全世界人民的大力支持下，埃及人民粉碎英法帝国主义武装侵略的胜利，伊拉克人民民族革命的胜利，阿拉伯人民击退美英帝国主义武装干涉的胜利，严重地打击了帝国主义在中近东的侵略政策，有力地鼓舞了亚非地区的民族解放运动。
    五年来，非洲人民已经普遍觉醒起来。非洲各国人民反对帝国主义、争取民族独立斗争的烽火到处燃烧起来。帝国主义在非洲的殖民体系已经根本动摇。非洲的面貌正在发生着巨大而深刻的变化。目前非洲五十九个国家和地区中，已经有十一个国家取得了独立。在民族独立运动蓬勃发展的形势下，帝国主义已被迫同意多哥、马达加斯加、刚果、索马里兰、尼日利亚和马里联邦等六个国家在1960年内宣布独立。一些已经取得了独立的非洲国家人民还正在为取消外国军事基地、维护国家主权和领土完整进行着不懈的斗争。英勇的阿尔及利亚人民始终坚持反对法国殖民军队镇压的武装斗争，五年多来已取得了歼敌十万多人，解放了三分之二的国土的巨大胜利。喀麦隆人民也正在为要求撤退法国侵略军、实现祖国的完全独立进行着顽强的斗争。目前，在西非、中非、东非和南非各地，在尼亚萨兰、南北罗得西亚、坦噶尼喀、乌干达、怯尼亚、刚果、卢安达—乌隆迪、索马里兰、桑给巴尔、安哥拉等地人民反殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争正在日益开展。南非人民长时期以来不屈不挠地进行着反对种族歧视、争取基本人权和自由的斗争，最近更对南非联邦当局的野蛮镇压和血腥屠杀进行着英勇的反抗。南非人民的正义斗争正在赢得亚非人民和全世界人民日益广泛的同情和支持。现在非洲各个地区、各个民族争取民族解放的斗争，正在风起云涌，如火如荼，并逐渐汇合成为一股民族革命的巨流。他们的斗争此起彼伏，相互配合，相互影响，使帝国主义疲于招架。非洲的独立运动已经进入了一个新的阶段，群众性的广泛和发展的迅速，都是非洲历史上空前未有的。伟大的全部非洲人民重新成为非洲大陆主人的日子已经不远了，帝国主义在非洲殖民体系的全面彻底崩溃已经日益迫在眼前了。
    万隆会议奠定了亚非人民团结合作的基础。随着亚非民族独立运动的蓬勃发展，亚非各国人民在共同斗争中的相互支持和友好合作也在日益加强
    亚非人民在民族解放斗争中所取得的一系列的胜利，严重地挫败了帝国主义在亚非地区的侵略和扩张活动，打乱了帝国主义发动战争的计划和部署，对保卫世界和平的事业作出了重大的贡献。事实证明，亚非人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争，是全世界人民反对帝国主义和维护世界和平斗争的一个重要组成部分。
    万隆会议奠定了亚非人民团结合作的基础。随着亚非民族独立运动的蓬勃发展，亚非各国人民在共同斗争中的相互支持和友好合作也在日益加强。五年来，亚非各国领导人之间的友好接触日益增多，各国间的贸易往来和文化交流也有了迅速的发展。继万隆会议之后，1957年与1958年之交所召开的第一届亚非人民团结大会，1958年所召开的全非人民大会、非洲独立国家会议，以及在这个期间内相继召开的亚非国家青年、学生、妇女、作家等一系列重要国际会议，都继承和进一步发扬了“万隆精神”，加强了亚非人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争中的团结合作。最近在几内亚首都科纳克里举行的第二届亚非人民团结大会已胜利地宣告结束。中国人民热烈地欢迎和支持大会所通过的各项决议。我们深信，会议的召开和所通过的各项决议将进一步巩固和发展亚非人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同斗争中的友好团结，进一步鼓舞和推动非洲民族独立运动的胜利前进，并将促使非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争进入一个更高的发展阶段。
    中国人民一向同情和支持非洲人民的正义斗争。反对帝国主义、维护世界和平和发展民族经济的共同任务把中国人民和非洲人民紧密地联结在一起。今天，我们非常愉快地在这里隆重庆祝中国非洲人民友好协会的正式成立。中国非洲人民友好协会的成立，必将使中国人民和非洲人民之间的战斗友谊进一步得到加强和发展，为亚非人民的共同事业和斗争做出新的更大的贡献。
    帝国主义的殖民体系正面临着最后崩溃的阶段。但是帝国主义并没有放弃殖民主义政策。目前，它们到处挑拨离间，千方百计地企图破坏亚非人民的团结
    同志们，朋友们！帝国主义的殖民体系正面临着最后崩溃的阶段。但是帝国主义并没有放弃殖民主义政策。帝国主义愈是接近死亡，就愈要进行绝望的挣扎。目前，帝国主义特别是美帝国主义正在继续执行战争侵略政策，加紧扩军备战，狂热地发展导弹武器，到处建立军事基地，并且竭力加强侵略性的军事集团。在中近东，美国正在利用中央条约组织和以色列，加紧对阿拉伯国家进行军事威胁和颠复活动。在印度支那，美国一贯破坏日内瓦协议，阻挠越南的和平统一，并阴谋扩大老挝内战。在远东，美国至今仍然赖在南朝鲜不走，阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，甚至公然在南朝鲜发射“斗牛士”导弹，对朝鲜和远东地区的和平进行新的挑衅。美国至今还霸占着我国的领土台湾，并不断地侵犯我国的领海领空。特别需要指出的是，美帝国主义在欧洲加紧武装西德的同时，又在东方竭力扶植日本军国主义，并同岸信介政府签订了侵略性的新的日美“安全条约”，使日本重新成为一个战争危险的策源地。这就不仅威胁着亚洲和非洲的安全，而且威胁着全世界人民的安全。目前，广大的日本人民正在为反对美日军事同盟、反对复活日本军国主义掀起一次又一次的声势浩大的全民性运动。我们坚信，日本人民的英勇的斗争，一定会取得最后胜利。粉碎美日反动派在亚洲策划新的侵略和战争的阴谋，不仅是日本人民的任务，也是亚洲和全世界各国人民的共同任务。中国人民坚决支持日本人民的斗争，并且同日本人民、亚非各国人民和全世界人民一起，为彻底粉碎美日反动派新的侵略和战争阴谋、确保亚洲和世界的和平而共同奋斗。
    在非洲，美帝国主义正积极支持旧的殖民国家对南非和非洲人民实行种族歧视政策和进行血腥屠杀，帮助法国殖民主义者镇压阿尔及利亚和喀麦隆人民，帮助比利时殖民主义者镇压刚果人民，并在许多非洲国家的土地上建立军事基地、驻扎武装部队，准备在必要时对非洲人民进行直接的武装镇压。这个新型的殖民主义者美帝国主义，却又打着和平的幌子，蒙上“同情”非洲独立的伪装，以提供所谓“援助”为名，积极向非洲大陆渗透。事实证明：美帝国主义在今天不仅是亚洲人民的头号敌人，也是非洲人民的最危险的敌人。
    帝国主义清楚地知道，亚非人民的团结是它们对亚非地区进行侵略扩张和保持殖民统治的严重障碍。因此，它们到处挑拨离间，散布不和，千方百计地企图破坏这种团结，使亚非国家彼此孤立起来，以达到各个击破，分而治之的目的。最近一年来，以美国为首的帝国主义特别不遗余力地破坏中国同某些亚非国家之间的友谊，它们纠集起一小撮反动势力，一再掀起反华浪潮，并且竭力破坏万隆精神和五项原则，一面叫嚣五项原则和万隆精神已经“过时”，已经“枯萎”；一面又叫嚣五项原则和万隆精神已被“抛弃”，已被“埋葬”。但是，万隆精神和和平共处五项原则是歪曲不了的，亚非人民在这一基础上的团结合作是破坏不了的。亚非人民深切地了解，它们有一千条、一万条理由应该互相团结和支持，而没有任何一条理由应该走向分裂和对立。帝国主义破坏亚非团结的阴谋，势必走向它们自己愿望的反面。事实证明，已经过时和枯萎了的不是别的，而正是帝国主义和殖民主义。它们早已为亚非人民和全世界人民所唾弃，在不久的将来就要迅速地全面地彻底地永远地被埋葬掉了。
    中国是万隆会议的参加国，又是和平共处五项原则的倡议国之一。中国一贯忠于和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，忠于反对帝国主义和维护世界和平的事业
    中国是万隆会议的参加国，同时又是和平共处五项原则的倡议国之一。中国人民同其他亚非国家人民有着长期遭受殖民主义迫害的共同经历，有着反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义和维护世界和平的共同任务。因此，中国人民和亚非各国人民很自然地共同具有深切同情和相互支持的愿望。多年以来，我国人民对于亚非各国人民争取和维护民族独立的每一个斗争，都给了尽可能的支持。同时，亚非各国人民也有力地支持了中国人民反对美国侵略、维护国家主权和领土完整的斗争。社会主义的中国一贯忠于反对帝国主义和维护世界和平的事业，忠于和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，中国和亚非国家在五项原则和万隆精神的基础上进一步发展了友好合作关系。应该特别指出的是今年1月，我国和缅甸签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅关于边界问题的协定，今年3月中国和尼泊尔又签订了中尼关于边界问题的协定。这些都标志着中国和这些国家之间的友好关系进入了一个新的阶段，为亚非各国的友好合作与和睦相处树立了新的范例。这是和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的又一次重大胜利，同时也是敌视亚非团结、敌视我国和平建设的帝国主义和反动分子的又一次惨重的失败。目前，我国周恩来总理代表着我国人民正在缅甸并即将前往印度、尼泊尔等国家进行友好访问，我们是具有无限的诚意的，我们完全相信，这次访问必将为亚非人民之间的友好合作做出新的重大的贡献。
    同志们，朋友们！目前的形势对于亚非人民反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争空前有利。万隆精神的光辉，正像早晨的太阳，照耀着亚非人民前进的道路，而帝国主义和殖民主义则已是日薄西山，奄奄一息了。亚非人民的正义事业有着强大的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的支持，有着全世界一切进步力量和爱好和平的人民的支持，只要我们进一步团结起来坚持不懈地进行反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争，我们争取和维护民族独立的事业就将取得更巨大、更辉煌的胜利。亚非各国人民更紧密地团结起来，高高举起万隆精神的旗帜，维护民族独立，维护世界和平，把帝国主义和殖民主义迅速地、全面地、彻底地、永远地埋葬干净！
    打倒帝国主义和殖民主义！
    万隆精神万岁！
    中国非洲人民友好团结万岁！
    亚非人民大团结万岁！
    全世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！　　　　　　　（标题是本报编者加的）（附图片）
