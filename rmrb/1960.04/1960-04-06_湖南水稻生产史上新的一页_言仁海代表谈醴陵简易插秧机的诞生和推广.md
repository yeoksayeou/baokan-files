Fellow Delegates:

    I fully endorse and agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report and all other reports of the conference. I will now give the conference a brief report on the birth and promotion of the Liling No. 2 simple rice transplanter in Hunan.

    The Creation of the Rice Transplanter Came from Ordinary Farmers

    In the nationwide upsurge of agricultural technological transformation, a great revolution in rice cultivation technology is underway in rural Hunan – vigorously promoting the use of rice transplanters. For thousands of years, the dream of the vast number of farmers to replace hand transplanting with machines, under the leadership of the Party, is finally beginning to be realized throughout Hunan Province. The 350,000 rice transplanters manufactured and promoted in Hunan Province this year are mainly Liling transplanters. This type of transplanter was successfully created by He Jisheng, a young farmer from the Qingshui River Commune in Liling County, in July 1958. After the full-scale promotion of rational close planting of rice in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, a person could only transplant three or four fen of land with hard work all day long, bending over and arching their backs, which was very tiring. However, the liberated working people, under the correct leadership of the Party, liberated their minds, broke superstitions, and carried forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, and launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The Liling simple rice transplanter was created under these circumstances. Comrade He Jisheng is an ordinary farmer who deeply understands the heavy labor of transplanting and also understands the urgent need of the broad masses of people to replace hand transplanting with machines. Based on the principle of hair separation from the comb and the two-finger branching method, he derived the principle of clip-type seedling separation. He engaged in production during the day and experiments at night. Together with carpenter Zhang Youqiu, after more than ten experiments and improvements, he finally created the Liling No. 1 simple rice transplanter. Later, in production practice, he continuously absorbed the opinions of the broad masses. By March 1959, he made several major improvements to the original design structure, resulting in the Liling No. 2 simple rice transplanter, which is now being preliminarily promoted throughout Hunan Province. This type of rice transplanter has been rated as one of the seven standardized rice transplanters in the country at this year's national on-site evaluation meeting of rice transplanters and semi-mechanized hydro-cultivation agricultural implements.

    The birth of the Liling simple rice transplanter was not smooth sailing but went through a tortuous and complicated ideological struggle. Comrade He Jisheng encountered cold ridicule and sarcasm from conservatives during the creation process. Some said, "A country bumpkin wants to create inventions; it's like a weasel trying to eat swan meat." Others said, "Mud-legged guys can develop rice transplanters? He's just making trouble when he has nothing to do." Under these taunts and blows, Comrade He Jisheng was not discouraged; on the contrary, with the Party's active support and encouragement, his determination became firmer, and his confidence became greater. In particular, Wu Jinyuan, the secretary of the Qingshui River Commune Party Committee, often studied with him and constantly encouraged him, giving him people when he needed them, money when he needed it, and materials when he needed them. At the same time, the county, prefectural, and provincial Party committees attached great importance to and actively supported this new thing, the rice transplanter, and provided assistance in many ways. The birth of the simple rice transplanter has created a new and glorious page in the history of rice production in Hunan.

    In 1958, the simple rice transplanter was tested on a small area in the Qingshui River Commune. In 1959, the provincial Party committee instructed to carry out extensive multi-point trials. In the course of the trials, it was attacked by right-leaning conservatives, who said, "A piece of wood and a bamboo clip cannot transplant rice." "Simple rice transplanters transplant poorly and affect production." But facts speak louder than words, and these fallacies were quickly debunked. In 1959, 179 communes in our province used rice transplanters, transplanting an area of 1,200 mu. Practice has proved that using this type of rice transplanter increases work efficiency by more than three times compared to manual transplanting, and the yield is not reduced but slightly increased in most cases. According to comparative trials in Shaodong, Yizhang, Pingjiang, Liling, and other counties under the same conditions, machine transplanting increased production by 5% to 15% compared to manual transplanting. The results of a comparative test of late rice in the same plot of land in Fanjia Mountain Commune, Shaoyang County, showed that machine-transplanted rice yielded 425 jin per mu, while hand-transplanted rice yielded 412 jin per mu, an increase of 13 jin per mu. Many other places have proven in trials that there is a slight increase in production. The right-leaning conservatives had to admit defeat in the face of these facts.

    The above facts show that as long as we uphold the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune under the correct leadership of the Party, and combine subjective initiative and objective possibilities well, there is nothing that cannot be done and no difficulties that cannot be overcome. The power of the working people is great, and the wisdom of the working people is infinite. We can create things that our predecessors did not have, and we can also do things that foreign countries have not yet done. The birth of the rice transplanter is ironclad proof.

    Four Major Advantages of the Liling Simple Rice Transplanter

    The Liling simple rice transplanter is currently a relatively good rice transplanting tool in our province because it has the following advantages:

    1. High transplanting efficiency. Each person can transplant two to three mu per day, increasing work efficiency by more than three times compared to manual transplanting.

    2. Good transplanting quality. Machine transplanting ensures uniform row spacing and rational close planting. The depth of the transplanted seedlings is consistent, about four centimeters, with small gaps and fewer footprints in the field. From pulling out the seedlings to transplanting them into the field, the exposure time is short, and the phenomena of wrapped-heart seedlings, hooked seedlings, injured seedlings, missed seedlings, and missing seedlings are rare. The qualified rate of effective seedlings generally reaches over 90%.

    3. Easy to operate, reducing labor intensity. It can be operated without bending over, without hands touching the mud, and is easy to use. Both male and female labor can use it.

    4. Simple structure, easy to obtain materials. It does not require steel, only a small amount of wood and moso bamboo, two liang of wire nails, and is easy to manufacture and low in cost, allowing it to quickly blossom everywhere.

    When transplanting late rice in 1959, the Qingshui River and Jiangshan production teams used seven rice transplanters. Due to the high work efficiency, they played a great role in rushing to harvest dry rice and rushing to transplant late rice. The commune members were overjoyed, and they sang: "It has been passed down for thousands of years, without machines transplanting the fields. It is difficult to express the hardship of transplanting by hand, with the face facing the mud and the back facing the sky, aching back and sore hands, it is difficult to transplant three fen of land in a day. The rice transplanter has many advantages, hands are not broken, and the back is not hunched, the whole body is light and the operation is skillful, it can catch the season and be advanced, the implementation of mechanized transplanting, increased grain production makes everyone happy."

    This ballad fully reflects the infinite love of the vast number of people in our province for this simple rice transplanter. It also marks that the successful creation of the rice transplanter is a major victory for the Party's leadership in the mass movement for tool reform. This is a product of the agricultural Great Leap Forward, and a product of the mass movement for technical innovation and technical revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    This year, in order to better promote this rice transplanter throughout Hunan Province, we started training manufacturing craftsmen as early as last winter, and arranged for more than 1,200 factories to specialize in manufacturing. By March 20th, 380,000 units had been manufactured, of which 270,000 were Liling No. 2 simple rice transplanters. More than 70 counties and cities have held rice transplanter training classes, training more than 800,000 operators. A tool reform movement centered on the promotion and use of simple rice transplanters is being carried out throughout the province. In order to realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of rice transplanting as soon as possible, we will continue to advance, strive for perfection, and continuously reform, and we must raise the simple rice transplanter to the level of semi-mechanization and mechanization to meet the needs of our province's sustained leap forward in agricultural production in the future.

    湖南水稻生产史上新的一页
    言仁海代表谈醴陵简易插秧机的诞生和推广各位代表：
    我完全拥护和同意李富春副总理的报告和大会其它各项报告。我现在就湖南醴陵二号简易插秧机的诞生和推广情况，向大会作一简要汇报。
    插秧机的创造出自普通农民
    在全民性的农业技术改造高潮中，湖南农村正在进行着一场水稻栽培技术上的大革命——大力推广使用水稻插秧机。千百年来广大农民梦想用机器代替手插秧的愿望在党的领导下，终于在湖南全省开始实现了。今年湖南省制造和推广的三十五万部插秧机主要是醴陵插秧机，这种插秧机是醴陵县清水江公社青年农民贺继生，在1958年7月创造成功的。大跃进的1958年全面推广水稻合理密植以后，一个人狠狠干一天只插三、四分田，弯身曲背，非常劳累。但解放了的劳动人民在党的正确领导下，解放了思想，破除了迷信，发扬了敢想、敢做的共产主义风格，开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，醴陵简易插秧机就是在这种情况下创造出来的。贺继生同志是一个普通农民，对插秧的繁重劳动体会很深，同时也很懂得广大人民群众迫切需要以机器代替手插秧的要求。他根据梳头的梳子和两指分枝分秧的方式，得出了夹式分秧的原理，白天搞生产，晚上搞试验，他与木工张有秋同志一起经过十多次试验改进后，终于创造成醴陵一号简易插秧机。后来又在生产实践中不断吸取广大群众意见，到1959年3月，在原设计结构基础上又作了几次较大的改进，就是现在在湖南全省初步进行推广的醴陵二号简易插秧机。这种插秧机，在今年全国水稻插秧机和半机械化水电耕作农具现场评比会议上，已评为全国七种定型插秧机之一。
    醴陵简易插秧机的诞生并不是一帆风顺的，而是经过了曲折繁杂的思想斗争。贺继生同志在创造过程中，曾受到保守派的冷潮热讽。有的说：“土包子想创造发明，真是黄鼠狼想吃天鹅肉。”还有的说：“泥巴腿子能搞插秧机，他是吃了饭冒事做。”贺继生同志在这些嘲笑和打击下，不但没有灰心丧气，相反的在党的积极支持鼓励下，决心更坚，信心更大，特别是在清水江公社党委书记吴金元同志经常与他一起研究，并不断鼓励他，要人有人，要钱有钱，要材料就给材料。同时县委、地委到省委对插秧机这个新生事物，都十分重视和积极支持，多方面给予帮助。简易插秧机的诞生，给湖南水稻生产史上创造了新的光辉一页。
    在1958年，简易插秧机在清水江公社作了小面积的试验，1959年省委指示开展广泛多点的试验。在试验过程中又遭到了右倾保守分子的攻击，他们说什么：“一块木板子，一个竹夹子，不能插秧。”“简易插秧机插秧，质量不好，影响生产。”但事实胜于雄辩，这些谬论很快就不攻自破了。1959年我省使用插秧机的有一百七十九个公社，插秧面积一千二百亩。实践证明：用这种插秧机插秧，工效比手工插提高三倍以上，产量不但没有减低，而且大多数略有增产。据邵东、宜章、平江、醴陵等县在同样条件下对比试验，机插比手插增产5％至15％。邵阳县范家山公社同丘田的晚稻试验对比结果，机插的每亩产四百二十五斤，手插的每亩产四百一十二斤，每亩增产十三斤。清水江公社江山生产队去年机插的五十多亩晚稻，平均每亩产一千一百六十四斤，比手插的（其他条件大体相同）平均每亩增产二十二斤。还有许多地方试验证明都是略有增产的。右倾保守分子在这些事实面前，也不得不服输。
    上述事实说明，只要在党的正确领导下高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，把主观能动性和客观可能性很好地结合起来，是没有什么办不了的事情和克服不了的困难。劳动人民的力量是伟大的，劳动人民的智慧是无穷的。我们可以创造前人所没有的东西，也可以办到外国还没有办到的事情。插秧机的诞生就是铁证。
    醴陵简易插秧机的四大好处
    醴陵简易插秧机在我省来说，当前还是一种较好的插秧工具，就是由于它具有下列优点：
    一、插秧工效高。每人每天可插两亩到三亩，比手插提高工效三倍以上。
    二、插秧质量好。机插行次均匀，能保证合理密植。机插秧苗深浅一致，距离深度都在四厘米左右，空隙小，田间脚印少，从拔出秧苗到插到田里，暴晒时间短，插秧时包心秧、勾秧、伤秧、漏秧、缺秧的现象都很少，有效苗合格率一般达到90％以上。
    三、操作轻便，能达到减轻劳动强度，操作时不弯腰，手不着泥，轻便好使，男女劳力都能使用。
    四、结构简单，取材容易，不要钢铁，只用少许木头楠竹，二两洋钉，制造简便，成本低廉，可以很快遍地开花。
    1959年插晚稻时，清水江、江山生产队运用七部插秧机，由于工效高，在抢收旱稻、抢插晚稻中发挥很大作用，社员们欢欣鼓舞，他们歌唱道：“自古相传几千年，没有机器插过田，用手插秧苦难言，脸朝泥巴背朝天，腰酸背痛手插破，一天难插三分田。插秧机来好处多，手不破来背不驼，一身轻便操作巧，能赶季节能提早，插秧实行机械化，粮食增产人人欢。”
    这首歌谣充分反映了我省广大人民对这种简易插秧机的无限喜爱。同时也标志着插秧机的创造成功，是党领导工具改革群众运动的重大胜利。这是农业大跃进的产物，是毛泽东思想指导技术革新、技术革命群众运动的产物。
    今年湖南全省为了更好的推广这种插秧机，早从去冬开始，全省就训练制造工匠，安排了一千二百多个厂子专门制造，到3月20号已制造三十八万部，其中有二十七万部是醴陵二号简易插秧机，有七十多个县市举办了插秧机训练班，培养操作手八十多万人。一个以推广使用简易插秧机为中心的工具改革运动，正在全省范围开展起来。为了尽快实现水稻插秧机半机械化和机械化，我们将继续前进，精益求精，不断改革，一定要把简易插秧机提高到半机械化和机械化水平，以适应我省今后农业生产持续跃进的需要。
