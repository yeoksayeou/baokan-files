    The National Liberation Movement is a Powerful Force for Defending World Peace
    Feng Bin Fu
    Currently, international tensions have eased somewhat, which is the result of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. In the fifteen years since the war, the world has been filled with round after round of struggle between the forces of peace and the forces of war. On the one hand, the imperialist war forces, headed by the United States, in a vain attempt to dominate and enslave the world, have been frantically creating tension everywhere, carrying out aggression and war provocations, and threatening world peace. On the other hand, the growing socialist forces, headed by the Soviet Union, holding high the banner of defending peace, have united with the vigorously developing national revolutionary forces and the people's forces in the imperialist countries to repeatedly compete with the imperialist war forces, headed by the United States. It is precisely because of the joint struggle of these three forces that the hands and feet of imperialism have been increasingly tightly bound, forcing them to dare not rashly launch a major war, forcing them to abandon some tensions and make some partial relaxation gestures in extreme isolation and difficulty in order to buy time and regroup. The situation of international class struggle further proves that the world's peace forces have an overwhelming advantage over the imperialist war forces.

    The National Liberation Movement is surging higher and higher
    The comprehensive and rapid disintegration of the post-war colonial system is the result of the further development of the second stage of the general crisis of capitalism. In an era when decadent capitalism cannot survive without relying more on colonies and semi-colonies, the more frantically imperialism struggles, the more it provokes increasingly universal and strong resistance everywhere. Just as capitalism produces its own gravedigger—the proletariat—colonialism also produces forces in colonies and semi-colonies that oppose foreign rule. The October Revolution brought a new era to the liberation of oppressed nations. The increasingly large masses of people in colonies and semi-colonies united under the banner of national liberation. After the Second World War, especially after the victory of the great Chinese revolution, with the support of the world socialist forces, the national liberation movement of oppressed nations further developed and formed an irresistible trend.

    Lenin pointed out decades ago: "New sources of great world storms are emerging in Asia... We are now in an era when these storms are prevalent and their 'reverse influence' is affecting Europe." (Note 1) Historical development has fully confirmed Lenin's prediction.

    The victory of the Chinese revolution in 1949 was an important turning point in the era when the Eastern storm "reversed its influence" on the West. China, a country that had long been in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal state, finally got rid of the shackles of imperialist rule after eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and four years of the War of Liberation. 650 million Chinese people stood up in the East of Asia. The People's Republic of China, the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, together with the Eastern European socialist countries born after the war, formed a powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which was geographically connected. This cannot but have a profound impact on the national liberation movement of all oppressed people. In the fifteen years since the war, with the support of powerful socialist forces, the national liberation movement has been surging higher and higher, sweeping across vast areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America with the force of a broken bamboo, drastically accelerating the collapse of the entire imperialist colonial rule. Imperialist colonial rulers are completely in a desperate situation like the one described in a fable: "Just as the tail is drawn out, the nose sinks in; just as the nose is drawn out, the tail sinks in." Whether it is the so-called "mysterious continent," the so-called "stable oasis," or the so-called "quiet backyard," it has become a volcano that can erupt at any time under the feet of imperialism.

    Imperialism has lost its original rule over most of mankind. It is estimated that the United Kingdom has lost about 88% of the population and about 60% of the territory of its colonial empire; France has lost about 55% of the population and 14% of the territory of its colonial empire; the Netherlands temporarily maintains only about 35% of the territory and about 1% of the population of its former empire. (Note 2) On the eve of World War II, the population of colonies and semi-colonies was about 1.5 billion, and now only 140 million remain. With the continued development of the national liberation struggle, the remaining colonial rule of imperialism is also in a state of "imminent danger."

    Imperialist colonial forces will never automatically withdraw from the stage of history. They are trying to maintain their rule over colonies and semi-colonies and are playing with all kinds of neo-colonialist conspiracies. In the current process of the continuous development of the national independence movement, more and more people are beginning to distinguish between true independence and false independence, as well as the despicable methods of imperialist countries attempting to replace political rule with economic enslavement. As the resolution on economic development issues passed by the All-African People's Conference not long ago pointed out: All independent African countries should intensify their efforts to free their own countries from economic dependence on imperialist countries. Therefore, for all oppressed nations, from striving for national independence to defending national independence, and from achieving political independence to achieving economic independence, they must go through arduous, complex, and tortuous struggles.

    One of the sources of world imperialist power lies in the marrow-sucking exploitation of the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of colonies and semi-colonies. It has always regarded colonies and semi-colonies as its rear. When it wants to launch a war of aggression, it always first controls and consolidates its "rear." As Stalin pointed out: "In order to wage war, it is not enough to expand armaments, it is not enough to organize new alliances. In order to wage war, capitalist countries must also consolidate their rear. No capitalist country can wage a serious war without first consolidating its rear and subjugating 'its own' workers and 'its own' colonies." (Note 3) However, under the repeated impact of the increasingly high-rising national revolutionary forces, not only are imperialism losing their "reliable rear" and "inexhaustible reserve forces," but also the "reliable rear" are increasingly becoming the front line against imperialism; the "inexhaustible reserve forces" are increasingly becoming the gravediggers of imperialist colonial rule.

    As the ally of the socialist forces that are the main force in defending peace, every step forward and every victory of the national liberation movement always strikes at the aggressive and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States. The victory of the Arab people's struggle against Britain and France to seize the Suez Canal in 1956, the victory of the Syrian people's struggle against US imperialist intervention in 1957, the victory of the Iraqi people in breaking the aggressive chain of the Baghdad Pact in 1958 and the victory of the Lebanese people in forcing the US imperialist aggressors to retreat, the victory of the Cuban people in overthrowing the Batista traitorous regime and opposing the barbaric intervention of the United States in 1959, and the repeated victories of the Algerian people against the French colonialists over the years, as well as the unyielding and heroic struggles of the people of Oman, the people of Cameroon, the people of the Congo, the people of Kenya... are all glorious records in the history of the struggle against imperialist war policies and for world peace. These victories have greatly encouraged the powerful development of the national liberation movements of the people of Africa and Latin America, and put the imperialist war maniacs, who are besieged on all sides, in a state of panic.

    Colonialism is War
    Imperialism is an endless disaster. Imperialism always uses war to maintain and promote its colonial rule. The common root of war and colonialism is imperialism. Therefore, struggling to overthrow colonial rule is also struggling to directly eliminate the threat of war and strive for lasting world peace.

    Colonial slave labor is the main element of capitalist primitive accumulation. Marx wrote: "The colonies provided a guarantee of markets for the then-burgeoning handicraft manufacturing industry, and even more, the exclusive market caused increased accumulation. Treasures looted directly from outside Europe by means of plunder, enslavement, and murder flowed back to the mother country, where they were transformed into capital." (Note 4) Imperialism expanded colonial aggression and plunder to an unprecedented degree, turning the political, economic, and military enslavement of the people of underdeveloped countries by capitalist powers into an entire system. According to Lenin's argument, this system has the following important characteristics:

    (1) Brutal oppression, enslavement, and plunder of oppressed nations are the forms of rule of imperialist countries over the people of these countries;

    (2) The colonial economy in the imperialist era is forced to become a component of the world capitalist economy, existing as the "world countryside" (agricultural raw material appendage);

    (3) Financial capital endlessly exploits underdeveloped countries economically on the basis of the international capitalist "division of labor" and the capitalist exchange form.

    The rule of the colonial system subjects the hundreds of millions of people under imperialist oppression and enslavement to the most cruel exploitation, and suffers from frequent hunger, poverty, and various diseases. The development of productive forces in colonies and semi-colonies is severely hindered. Imperialism gives the economy of colonies and semi-colonies a single nature, and the entire economic life of colonies and semi-colonies depends on the sale of a few commodities—coffee, sugar, rubber, tin, copper, etc. A drop in the price of raw materials in the world market will immediately have a disastrous impact on colonies and semi-colonies. Imperialism extracts maximum profits through capital export. For example, the profits brought by US monopoly capitalists' investments in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, "an annual profit rate of 200% or 300% is not uncommon." (Note 5) Imperialism also sucks the marrow of the people of colonies and semi-colonies through means such as "foreign aid" and unequal exchange, and makes them fall into the trap of control. In short, under imperialist colonial rule, the vast number of people in colonies and semi-colonies are in an extremely powerless state politically and in an unbearable and miserable situation in life.

    The history of colonies has always been full of colonial wars and the history of armed suppression of people's resistance. Before the imperialist era, in the nineteenth century, there were the Java riots from 1825 to 1830, the Indian soldiers' uprising (serving in the British army) from 1857 to 1859, and the Sudanese armed struggle from 1883 to 1885, etc. (Note 6) In the era of imperialism, the struggle of the people of colonies and semi-colonies against oppression and for freedom has continued to develop with the intensified exploitation and suppression of imperialism, and violent rule has become the basis of the relationship between imperialism and colonies and semi-colonies. Lenin pointed out: Imperialist countries "completely rely on continuous wars to achieve the rule over hundreds of millions of residents of colonies." (Note 7)

    Another feature of the imperialist era is that the great powers have completed the division of the world. Due to the law of uneven political and economic development of capitalism, wars to re-divide the world are brewing in any so-called "peace" period. Lenin pointed out: "The more developed capitalism is, the scarcer raw materials are, and the more intense the competition and the struggle to chase the source of raw materials throughout the world are." (Note 8) He also said: "World hegemony is the content of imperialist policy, and the continuation of this policy is imperialist war." (Note 9) The world war from 1914 to 1918 was an imperialist war to re-divide the world. The Second World War, which began in 1939, was also provoked by the so-called "have-not" imperialist countries (Germany, Italy, and Japan) in their struggle for hegemony with the so-called "have" imperialist countries (Britain, France, and the United States). After the Second World War, the United States became the big boss of the imperialist camp. The weakened major Western imperialist countries have to follow its lead. However, due to the shrinking world capitalist market, in fact, the struggle between them for markets and the desire to drown their competitors has not only not eased, but has become more acute. Imperialism has formed alliances, and Lenin said that these alliances "are peaceful today, not peaceful tomorrow, and not peaceful the day after tomorrow." (Note 10) It can be seen that the struggle between imperialist countries for colonies and semi-colonies is also one of the sources of modern war. As the Moscow Conference Declaration pointed out: "As long as imperialism exists, there is soil for aggressive war to occur."

    Imperialism always uses colonial policy to serve its ambition to enslave the world. Therefore, colonialism not only harms the local people who are directly subjected to its aggression, but also inevitably threatens world peace. Before the Second World War, Japan seized a large part of China's territory from the northeast to the central part. Italy seized Ethiopia. At that time, the aggressive acts of Japanese, Italian, and German fascists not only disrupted the peaceful lives of the people of China, Ethiopia, and Central Europe, but also threatened world peace. However, the Western countries at that time fantasized that German, Italian, and Japanese fascists were anti-Soviet and anti-communist, so they adopted a policy of appeasement, which eventually backfired and led to the outbreak of a world war. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Since the monster of imperialism was born, the affairs of the world have been linked together, and it is impossible to cut them open." (Note 11) This shows that world peace is indivisible. Any war provoked by imperialist aggressors, even a local or "limited" war in a remote corner of the world, is a threat to all peace-loving countries.

    Lenin said: "War is caused by imperialism. Imperialism is the 'enslavement' of all nations by a small group of 'great powers', 'enslavement' of all the nations of the world. Therefore, we must help the masses to overthrow imperialism, otherwise it is impossible to achieve a peace without annexation. Of course, the struggle to overthrow imperialism is arduous, but the masses should know the truth of carrying out this arduous and necessary struggle. The masses should not be intoxicated by the illusion that peace can be achieved without overthrowing imperialism." (Note 12)

    Since the October Revolution, especially since the victory of the Chinese revolution, oppressed nations all over the world have increasingly realized that the aggression and enslavement of imperialism must not be tolerated. Tolerating the aggression and enslavement of imperialism not only does not help peace, but also poses the risk of further expanding aggression by imperialism. In 1931, the Chiang Kai-shek Group adopted a policy of "non-resistance," retreating step by step to the aggression of Japanese imperialism, which led to the consequence of further large-scale aggression by Japanese imperialism, which is historical proof.

    In order to maintain peace, we must resist aggression. This is an undeniable truth. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in 1938 when discussing our national revolutionary war against aggression: "Our war is sacred, just, progressive, and peace-seeking. We seek not only the peace of one country but also the peace of the world, not only temporary peace but also permanent peace." (Note 13) The oppressed nations use various forms of struggle, including the highest form of struggle—armed struggle—to resist the aggression and oppression of imperialism, which are all struggles conducive to maintaining peace. The armed struggle of the Algerian and Cameroonian people against the French colonialists, and the armed struggle of the people of Oman and the people of southern Yemen against British imperialism, are precisely sacred, just, progressive, and peace-seeking struggles.

    US Imperialism is the Pillar of Contemporary Colonialism
    In the fifteen years since the war, US imperialism has inherited Hitler's mantle, waving the black flag of anti-communism, piecing together military aggression groups everywhere, establishing military bases everywhere, and carrying out interference and war provocations everywhere. On the one hand, it has tried its best, in an open or covert manner, to prevent the development of the national independence movement, acting as the savior of dying colonialism, supporting the old colonialists such as Britain and France to prolong their crumbling colonial rule; on the other hand, it has promoted the honey-tongued "Eisenhower Doctrine," taking advantage of the opportunity of the rapid disintegration of Western European imperialism's colonial rule in Asia and Africa to replace the colonial countries such as Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium. US imperialism uses the pretext of "preventing the communist threat," but the spearhead of its aggression and expansion is first directed at the "intermediate zone" between the socialist camp and the imperialist camp. The US "defense line" is expanding without limit. Never in any era has a country like the United States had such a large number of military bases abroad in peacetime. The US imperialist so-called "defense line" against the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp has actually become a neo-colonialist chain added to the heads of many countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out as early as 1946: "There is an extremely vast area between the United States and the Soviet Union, where there are many capitalist countries and colonial and semi-colonial countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Before the US reactionaries subdue these countries, they cannot talk about attacking the Soviet Union. Now the United States controls more territory in the Pacific than all the spheres of influence of Britain in the past. ... Under various pretexts, the United States is carrying out large-scale Military arrangements and establishing military bases in many countries. The US reactionaries say that all the naval base which they have established and are preparing to establish throughout the world are for the purpose of opposing the Soviet Union. True, these military base are directed against the Soviet Union. But at present, it is not the Soviet Union but these countries where military base are being established which are first subjected to US aggression." (Note 14)

    The ferocity and viciousness of American neo-colonialism is worse than that of old-brand colonialism. Its methods of aggression are diverse, with both literary and military, soft and hard, political, economic, military, and cultural, with sugar-coated poison—"aid," and with deceptive propaganda and the disguise of a tiger acting as "grandma." However, the actions of the United States constantly expose itself, and more and more people in various countries of the world realize that Eisenhower's banner is actually the pirate's banner. As the American writer Mark Twain said long ago: "The white stripes on the American flag should be painted black, and the stars on the flag should be changed to skulls and crossbones." (Note 15) US imperialism has become the last and largest pillar of contemporary colonialism, the center of reactionary forces around the world, and the most vicious enemy of the masses of the people.

    In the situation of the increasing rise of the world's national revolutionary forces, US imperialism has long discovered that its situation is becoming more and more "unfavorable." Not long before Dulles' death (January 14, 1959), he advocated that the United States must "use our will, energy, wealth, and technology to deal with the problems of less developed regions." In a report on US foreign policy published by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund in December 1959, it also advocated that the United States use "unconscious influence" on some nationalist countries, that is, take a more covert approach to gradually draw them closer to the United States. US President Eisenhower's trip to Asia and Africa at the end of 1959 and his trip to South America in March of this year, under the guise of "peace" and "friendship," are all practices taken for this purpose. The United States has only one purpose for its two sets of practices in the intermediate zone—to save the collapse of colonial rule. The "friendly" and "friendly" set is precisely to serve the set of aggression and enslavement.

    There is a metaphor in the Buddhist scriptures that says that no matter how the devil dresses up, he cannot fill the role of a heavenly woman. Aggression is the nature of imperialism. The various methods adopted by imperialism to facilitate aggression are still aggression. War is the continuation of peacetime policy, and peace is the continuation of wartime policy. As Lenin pointed out: "Every ruling class that exercised dominance before the war guaranteed to achieve its goals by so-called 'peaceful' means. The reason why it is said to be 'so-called' is because those means of suppression used by them to 'peacefully' rule the colonies cannot be called peaceful." (Note 16) It is very clear: The US imperialist suppression, enslavement, and oppression of all oppressed nations, the large-scale aggression against the intermediate zone between the United States and the socialist camp, no matter what deceptive, covert, or disguised peaceful means are adopted, its essence is always violent, and it "cannot be called peaceful." What's more, while adopting "peaceful" methods, US imperialism continues to expose itself with naked acts of aggression. Who occupied our territory of Taiwan? It is the United States; who is carrying out barbaric bombings and brutal threats against Cuba, which insists on national independence? It is the United States; who is carrying out military suppression against the people of Panama who demand the return of sovereignty over the canal? It is the United States; who is helping the French colonialists to slaughter the people of Algeria and Cameroon? It is the United States; who is helping the Belgian colonialists transport colonial troops to suppress the people of the Congo? It is the United States; who is creating the civil war in Laos and interfering in the internal affairs of Laos? It is the United States; who is using the Central Treaty Organization and Israel to carry out military threats and subversive activities against Arab countries? It is the United States!

    Imperialist colonial rule is war, a war, bloody and bloodless, declared and undeclared, that is happening here and there every day. The struggle of all oppressed nations against colonialism is inevitably closely linked to the struggle for peace, and becomes an integral and important part of the struggle for world peace. Supporting the just struggle of the people of Asia, the people of Africa, and the people of Latin America against colonialism is also the most important obligation to defend world peace.

    Powerful Forces to Stop Imperialist War Policies
    The first half of the 20th century ended with the collapse of the imperialist colonial system in Asia. The second half of the 20th century began with the rapid disintegration of the imperialist colonial system in Africa and the huge tide of national democratic movements sweeping across Latin America. At the moment when this historical change is turning towards the complete and thorough elimination of the imperialist colonial system, US imperialism, however, regards itself as the pillar of colonialism, vainly attempting to establish a colonial empire without borders on the ruins of colonial rule. US imperialism wants to play the role of Britain in the 19th century in the 1960s.

    However, the era has completely changed. Now is the era of the comprehensive disintegration of the colonial system and the imminent demise of imperialism. The brilliant victories won by the people of Asia, the people of Africa, and the people of Latin America in their common struggle not only show that they have increasingly firmly grasped their own destiny, but also show that they have become a powerful force to stop imperialist war policies, playing an increasingly great role in the struggle of the people of the world for peace.

    Imperialism is preparing the conditions for its own demise. The masses of the people of the oppressed nations are one of such conditions. Now is the historical era in which imperialism is driving the masses of the people of the oppressed nations to embark on the great struggle to eliminate imperialism. Various acts of aggression by the imperialist forces headed by the United States, whether barbaric suppression or deceptive conspiracies, will continue to play a role in mobilizing the people of the world to rise up against the imperialist aggressors. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The life of the imperialists will not be long, because they do all bad things, specialize in supporting the anti-people reactionaries in various countries, occupy a large number of colonies, semi-colonies, and military bases, and threaten peace with atomic war. In this way, they are forcing more than 90% of the people in the world to rise up against them, either now or in the future." (Note 17) The US imperialist bombing of the Cuban people, the French imperialist bloody suppression of the Algerian people with the support of the United States, and the British colonialists' barbaric massacre of the unarmed South African people can only deepen the deep hatred of the Cuban people, the Algerian people, and the South African people towards imperialism, can only arouse more African people and Latin American people to rise up to fight against imperialism, and can only cause the socialist forces and all peace-loving people in the world to sympathize with and support the Cuban people, the Algerian people, and the South African people. Imperialism is also creating its own increasing isolation with its own actions. The strongman of today is clearly not US imperialism but the 6.5 million Cuban people; not French imperialism but the 10 million Algerian people; not British imperialism but the 600,000 Omani people. The national liberation movement sweeping across Asia, Africa, and Latin America will inevitably rise further, and the forces of peace will inevitably further overwhelm the forces of war.

    民族解放运动是保卫世界和平的强大力量
    冯宾符
    目前，国际紧张局势有了某些缓和，这是东风压倒西风的结果。战后十五年来，世界上充满着和平力量同战争势力一个回合又一个回合的搏斗。一方面，以美国为首的帝国主义战争势力为了妄图霸占和奴役世界，到处疯狂地制造紧张，肆行侵略和战争挑衅，威胁世界的和平。另一方面，日益壮大的以苏联为首的社会主义力量，高举着捍卫和平的旗帜，联合了蓬勃发展的民族革命力量同帝国主义国家中的人民力量，对以美国为首的帝国主义战争势力进行了反复的较量。正是由于这三种力量的联合斗争，这才愈来愈紧地束缚住了帝国主义的手脚，迫使他们不敢贸然发动大战，迫使他们在极端孤立和困难中不得不放弃部分紧张，并作出某些部分缓和的姿态，以争取时间，重整旗鼓。国际阶级斗争的形势进一步证明，世界和平力量对于帝国主义战争势力占了压倒的优势。
    民族解放运动一浪盖过一浪澎湃奔腾
    战后殖民体系全面、迅剧的瓦解，是资本主义总危机第二阶段进一步发展的结果。在没落的资本主义非更加依赖殖民地半殖民地便不能过活的时代，帝国主义越是疯狂挣扎，到处乱碰乱撞，就越是激起日益普遍和强烈的反抗。正像资本主义产生自己的掘墓人——无产阶级一样，殖民主义也在殖民地半殖民地中产生着反对外国统治的力量。十月革命一声炮响，给被压迫民族的解放开辟了新时代。殖民地半殖民地的日益扩大的人民群众，在争取民族解放的旗帜下团结起来了。在第二次世界大战特别是伟大的中国革命胜利以后，在世界社会主义力量的支持之下，被压迫民族解放运动进一步向前发展，形成了不可抗拒的潮流。
    列宁在几十年前就指出：“极大的世界风暴的新源泉正在亚洲涌现出来了。……我们现在正处在这些风暴盛行及其‘反转来影响’欧洲的时代。”（注一）历史发展完全证实了列宁的预见。
    1949年中国革命的胜利正是东方风暴“反转来影响”西方的时代的一个重要转折点。中国这个曾经长期处于半殖民地半封建状态的国家，经过八年抗日战争，经过四年的解放战争之后，终于摆脱了帝国主义统治的枷锁。六亿五千万中国人民在亚洲的东方站起来了。中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国同战后诞生的东欧社会主义国家一起，形成了地理上连成一片的、以苏联为首的、强大的社会主义阵营。这对于一切被压迫人民的民族解放运动不能不发生极其深远的影响。战后十五年来，在强大的社会主义力量的支持下，民族解放运动一浪盖过一浪地澎湃奔腾，以破竹之势席卷着亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的广大地区，剧烈地加速着整个帝国主义殖民统治的崩溃。帝国主义殖民统治者完全陷入了像一个寓言所描写的绝望境地里：“刚刚抽出尾巴来，鼻子又陷落下去了；刚刚抽出鼻子来，尾巴又陷落下去了。”所谓“神秘的大陆”也罢，所谓“安定的绿洲”也罢，所谓“宁静的后院”也罢，到处成了帝国主义脚下随时可以爆发的火山。
    帝国主义已经丧失了对于大部分人类的原有统治。据估计，英国已丧失了其殖民帝国的人口88％，领土60％左右；法国丧失了其殖民帝国的人口55％，领土14％；荷兰暂时保持着仅有过去帝国领土的35％，人口1％左右。（注二）在第二次大战前夕，殖民地半殖民地的人口大约为十五亿，现在只剩一亿四千万人。随着民族解放斗争的继续发展，帝国主义仅存的殖民统治也处于“朝不保夕”的地步。
    帝国主义殖民势力绝不会自动退出历史舞台。它们力图维持它们对殖民地、半殖民地的统治，并玩弄形形色色新殖民主义的阴谋诡计。在当前民族独立运动不断发展的过程中，越来越多的人民群众开始辨清真独立和假独立的分野，以及帝国主义国家企图以经济奴役代替政治统治的卑鄙手法。正如不久以前召开的全非人民大会所通过的经济发展问题决议所指出：一切独立的非洲国家，加紧努力，来使他们自己的国家摆脱在经济上依赖帝国主义国家的状态。所以，对于所有被压迫民族来说，无论从争取民族独立到保卫民族独立，从实现政治独立到实现经济独立，都必须经过艰巨、复杂、曲折的斗争。
    世界帝国主义力量的源泉之一在于敲骨吸髓地榨取殖民地半殖民地的人力、物力和财力。它一向把殖民地、半殖民地作为它的后方，它要发动侵略战争，总是首先控制和巩固它的“后方”。正如斯大林所指出：“为了进行战争，单是扩张军备还不够，单是组织新的联盟还不够。为了进行战争，资本主义国家还必须巩固后方。任何一个资本主义国家，如果不预先巩固自己的后方，不预先制服‘自己的’工人和‘自己的’殖民地，就不能进行严重的战争。”（注三）但是，在日益高涨的民族革命力量的反复冲击下，不但帝国主义正在丧失它们“可靠的后方”和“取之不竭的后备力量”，而且，“可靠的后方”正在日益变成反帝国主义的前线；“取之不竭的后备力量”正在日益变成帝国主义殖民统治的埋葬者。
    作为捍卫和平主力的社会主义力量的同盟军，民族解放运动的每一步发展和每一次胜利，总是打击着以美国为首的帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策。1956年阿拉伯人民反抗英法夺取苏伊士运河斗争的胜利，1957年叙利亚人民反抗美帝国主义干涉的胜利，1958年伊拉克人民打断巴格达条约侵略锁链的胜利和黎巴嫩人民迫使美帝国主义侵略军逐退的胜利，1959年古巴人民推翻巴蒂斯塔卖国政权、反对美国横蛮干涉的胜利，几年以来，阿尔及利亚人民再三打击法国殖民者的胜利，以及阿曼人民、喀麦隆人民、刚果人民、怯尼亚人民……不屈不挠的英勇斗争，都是反对帝国主义战争政策、争取世界和平的斗争史上光辉的记录。这些胜利大大鼓舞了非洲和拉丁美洲人民的民族解放运动的强大发展，使四面楚歌的帝国主义战争狂人陷于惊惶失措的境地。
    殖民主义就是战争
    帝国主义是永无尽头的灾祸。帝国主义总是用战争来维持和推行它的殖民统治。战争和殖民主义的共同根源就是帝国主义。因之，为推翻殖民统治而斗争，也就是为直接消除战争威胁和争取世界持久和平的斗争。
    殖民主义奴隶劳动是资本主义原始积累的主要要素。马克思写道：“殖民地对于当时茁长中的手工制造业，保证了市场，更由市场的独占，引起加强的积累。在欧洲外部直接由劫掠、奴役、谋财害命等手段劫取到的财宝，都流回母国，在那里转化为资本。”（注四）帝国主义把殖民侵略和掠夺扩大到空前的程度，把资本主义强国对不发达国家人民的政治、经济、军事奴役变成了整个体系。依据列宁的论断，这个体系具有如下的重要特点：
    （一）对被压迫民族进行残暴压迫、奴役和掠夺，是帝国主义国家对这些国家的人民的统治形式；
    （二）殖民地经济在帝国主义时代被迫变成世界资本主义经济的组成部分，作为“世界农村”（农业原料附属地）而存在；
    （三）财政资本在国际资本主义“劳动分工”和资本主义交换形式的基础上对不发达国家从经济上进行无止境的剥削。
    殖民体系的统治使得帝国主义压迫、奴役之下的亿万人民受到最残酷的剥削，遭到经常的饥饿、贫困和各种疾病的折磨。殖民地半殖民地的生产力发展受到严重的阻碍。帝国主义使殖民地半殖民地经济被赋予单一的性质，殖民地半殖民地的全部经济生活都依靠出售少数的几种商品——咖啡、糖、橡胶、锡、铜等等。世界市场上原料价格的下降，就立刻会在殖民地半殖民地造成灾害性的影响。帝国主义通过资本输出来攫取最大限度的利润。例如美国垄断资本家在非洲、中东和东南亚的投资带来的利润，“每年利润率200％或300％并不是稀罕的事。”（注五）帝国主义还通过“对外援助”和不等价交换等手段吮吸殖民地半殖民地人民的膏血，并使它们落入控制的圈套。总之，在帝国主义殖民统治下，广大的殖民地半殖民地人民在政治上处于极端无权的状况，在生活上陷入不堪忍受的悲惨境地。
    殖民地的历史从来就是充满着殖民战争以及武力镇压人民反抗的历史。在帝国主义时代以前的十九世纪，就发生过1825至1830年的爪哇暴动。1857至1859年（在英军中服务的）印度兵起义，以及1883至1885年的苏丹武装斗争等。（注六）到了帝国主义时代，殖民地半殖民地人民反对压迫、争取自由的斗争随着帝国主义的加紧榨取和镇压而不断地发展，暴力统治更加成了帝国主义同殖民地、半殖民地之间相互关系的基础。列宁指出：帝国主义国家“完全靠连绵不断的战争实现了对殖民地亿万居民的统治。”（注七）
    帝国主义时代的另一个特征是列强瓜分世界完毕。由于资本主义政治、经济发展不平衡规律的作用。在任何所谓“和平”时期都在酝酿着重新分割世界的战争。列宁指出：“资本主义愈发达，原料愈缺乏，竞争和追逐全世界原料来源的斗争愈紧张。”（注八）又说：“世界霸权是帝国主义政策的内容，而这种政策的继续便是帝国主义战争。”（注九）1914至1918年的世界大战是重新分割世界的帝国主义战争。1939年开始的第二次世界大战，也是所谓“无”的帝国主义国家（德、意、日），同所谓“有”的帝国主义国家（英、法、美）争夺霸权而挑起的。第二次世界大战以后，美国成了帝国主义阵营的大头子。被削弱了的西方主要帝国主义国家都要仰承它的鼻息。但是，由于资本主义世界市场的日益缩小，实际上，它们之间争夺市场的斗争以及想把自己的竞争者淹死的愿望不但毫未缓和，而且更加尖锐了。帝国主义结成了同盟，列宁说过这种同盟“今天是和平的，明天不是和平的，后天又不是和平的。”（注十）可见，帝国主义国家之间争夺殖民地半殖民地的斗争，也是现代战争的根源之一。正如莫斯科会议宣言所指出：“只要帝国主义还存在，就有发生侵略战争的土壤。”
    帝国主义总是以殖民政策为其奴役世界的野心计划服务，故尔殖民主义不但危害了直接遭受其侵略的当地人民，同时必然威胁世界的和平，在第二次大战以前，日本强占了中国从东北到中部的很大一部分领土。意大利强占了埃塞俄比亚。当时日本、意大利以及德国法西斯的侵略行为，不但破坏了中国、埃塞俄比亚和中欧人民的和平生活，而且也威胁着世界的和平。但是当时西方国家幻想德意日法西斯反苏反共，因而采取了纵容侵略的政策，结果终至搬起石头打自己的脚，招致了世界大战的爆发。毛泽东同志说过：“自从帝国主义这个怪物出世之后，世界的事情就联成一气了，要想割开也不可能了。”（注十一）这说明了世界和平不可分割。帝国主义侵略者所挑起的任何一个战争，即使是在世界上某一个遥远角落里进行的一个局部的或“有限度”的战争，也就是对于所有爱好和平的国家的威胁。
    列宁说过：“战争是由帝国主义引起的。帝国主义是一小撮‘大国’‘奴役’各民族，‘奴役’全世界所有民族。因此，我们要帮助群众推翻帝国主义，否则就不可能实现不割地的和平。自然，推翻帝国主义的斗争是艰巨的，但是群众应当知道进行这一艰巨而必需的斗争的真理。群众不应当陶醉在不推翻帝国主义也可以实现和平的幻想之中。”（注十二）
    十月革命以来，特别是中国革命胜利以来，全世界被压迫民族越来越认识到决不能容忍帝国主义的侵略和奴役的道理。容忍帝国主义的侵略和奴役，不但无助于和平，而且更有招致帝国主义进一步扩大侵略的危险。1931年，蒋介石集团对于日本帝国主义的侵略采取了步步退让的“不抵抗”政策，招致了日本帝国主义进一步大举侵略的后果，就是历史的证明。
    为了维护和平，必须反抗侵略，这是一条颠扑不破的真理。毛泽东同志1938年在论述我国反侵略的民族革命战争时指出：“我们的战争是神圣的、正义的，是进步的、求和平的。不但求一国的和平而且求世界的和平，不但求一时的和平，而且求永久的和平”。（注十三）被压迫民族用各种斗争的方式，包括斗争的最高形式——武装斗争来反抗帝国主义的侵略和压迫，都是有利于维护和平的斗争。阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆人民反抗法国殖民者的武装斗争，阿曼人民和也门南部人民反抗英帝国主义的武装斗争，也正是神圣的、正义的、进步的、求和平的斗争。
    美帝国主义是当代殖民主义的支柱
    战后十五年来，美国帝国主义继承了希特勒的衣钵，打着反对共产主义的黑旗，到处拼凑军事侵略集团，到处建立军事基地，到处进行干涉和战争挑衅。它一方面以公开的或隐蔽的方式竭力阻挡民族独立运动的发展，充当垂死的殖民主义救命人的角色，支撑英法等老牌殖民主义者苟延其摇摇欲坠的殖民统治；一方面又推行口蜜腹剑的“艾森豪威尔主义”，利用西欧帝国主义在亚非殖民统治急剧瓦解的机会，取英法荷比等殖民国家而代之。美帝国主义借口“防止共产主义威胁”，但它的侵略和扩张的矛头，却首先指向着介于社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营之间的“中间地带”。美国的“国防线”无限制地在扩展，任何一个时代都没有一个国家像美国这样在和平时期在国外拥有这样大量的军事基地。美帝国主义所谓针对苏联和整个社会主义阵营的“国防线”，实际上成为加在欧洲、亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲许多国家头上的新殖民主义的锁链。毛泽东同志早在1946年指出：“美国和苏联中间隔着极其辽阔的地带，这里有欧、亚、非三洲的许多资本主义国家和殖民地、半殖民地国家。美国反动派在没有压服这些国家之前是谈不到进攻苏联的。现在美国在太平洋控制了比英国过去的全部势力范围还要多的地方。……美国在各种借口之下，在许多国家进行大规模的军事布置，建立军事基地。美国反动派说，他们在世界各地已经建立和准备建立的一切海军基地，都是为着反对苏联的。不错，这些军事基地是指向苏联。但是，在现时，首先受到美国侵略的不是苏联，而是这些被建立军事基地的国家。”（注十四）
    美国新殖民主义的凶狠毒辣，比起老牌殖民主义有过之而无不及。它的侵略方式是多种多样的，有文有武，有软有硬，有政治、经济、军事和文化，有包着糖衣的毒药——“援助”，又有欺骗的宣传和老虎扮作“外婆”的伪装。但是美国的行动不断地自己揭穿着自己，越来越多的世界各国人民都认识到，艾森豪威尔的旗帜，其实就是海盗的旗帜。正如美国十九世纪文豪马克吐温老早所说的：美国国旗上的“白条应当涂成黑色，旗上的星应当改为骷髅头和交叉骨。”（注十五）美国帝国主义已成为当代殖民主义的最后也是最大的支柱，成为全世界反动势力的中心，成为人民群众最凶恶的敌人。
    在世界民族革命力量日益高涨的形势下，美国帝国主义也早已发现自己的处境越来越“不妙”。杜勒斯死前不久（1959年1月14日），就主张美国必须“运用我们的意志、精力、财富和技术来处理不那么发达的地区的问题”。洛克菲勒兄弟基金会在1959年12月发表的一篇关于美国外交政策的报告中，也主张美国对某些民族主义国家运用“不知不觉的影响”，即采取较为隐蔽的方法使它们逐步靠拢美国。美国总统艾森豪威尔在1959年年底的亚非之行，今年3月的南美之行，打着“和平”“亲善”的幌子，都是为此目的而采取的一种做法。美国对中间地带的两套做法只有一个目的——挽救殖民统治的崩溃。“友好”“亲善”的一套正是为侵略奴役的一套服务。
    佛经里有一个譬喻，说魔鬼怎么打扮也充不了天女。侵略是帝国主义的本性。帝国主义为了便利侵略而采取的形形色色的手法总还是侵略。战争是平时政策的继续，和平是战时政策的继续。正如列宁所指出：“每个战前实行统治的阶级都保证用所谓的‘和平’手段来达到自己的目的。其所以说是‘所谓的’，是因为它们为了‘和平地’统治殖民地而采用的那些镇压手段，未必能够称得上是和平的。”（注十六）事情很清楚：美帝国主义对于一切被压迫民族的镇压、奴役和压迫，对于美国和社会主义阵营之间中间地带的大下侵略毒手，不管采取怎样欺骗、隐蔽或伪装和平的手法，其本质总是暴力的，而“未必能够称得上是和平的。”更何况美帝国主义在采取“和平”手法的同时，仍然不断用赤裸裸的侵略行为自己揭露着自己。是谁侵占了我国领土台湾？是美国；是谁在对于坚持民族独立的古巴进行野蛮的轰炸和粗暴的威胁？是美国；是谁在对于要求收回运河主权的巴拿马人民进行军事镇压？是美国；是谁在帮助法国殖民主义者屠杀阿尔及利亚和喀麦隆的人民？是美国；是谁在帮助比利时殖民主义者运送殖民军队去镇压刚果的人民？是美国；是谁在制造老挝内战，干涉老挝内政？是美国；是谁在利用中央条约组织和以色列，对阿拉伯国家进行军事威胁和颠覆活动？是美国！
    帝国主义殖民统治就是战争，就是每天在这里和那里发生的一种流血的和不流血的、宣战的和不宣战的战争。一切被压迫民族反对殖民主义的斗争，必然同争取和平的斗争紧密地联结在一起，而成为争取世界和平斗争的不可分割的重要组成部分。支持亚洲人民、非洲人民和拉丁美洲人民反殖民主义的正义斗争，同时也是捍卫世界和平的头等重要的义务。
    制止帝国主义战争政策的强大力量
    二十世纪前半期以帝国主义殖民体系在亚洲的崩溃而告终。二十世纪后半期以帝国主义殖民体系在非洲的迅速瓦解和民族民主运动的巨流席卷拉丁美洲而开始。就在这个历史巨变转向完全和彻底消灭帝国主义殖民体系的时刻，美国帝国主义却以殖民主义的支柱自居，妄图在殖民统治的废墟上建立没有国界的殖民帝国。美帝国主义要在二十世纪的六十年代，扮演十九世纪英国的角色。
    然而时代完全变了。现在是殖民体系全面瓦解、帝国主义濒临灭亡的时代。亚洲人民、非洲人民和拉丁美洲人民在他们共同斗争中所获得的辉煌的胜利，不但表明他们已经日益牢固地掌握自己的命运，而且也表明他们成为一支制止帝国主义战争政策的强大力量，在全世界人民争取和平的斗争中起着日益巨大的作用。
    帝国主义给自己准备着灭亡的条件。被压迫民族的人民大众，就是这样的条件之一。现在是帝国主义驱使被压迫民族的人民大众走上消灭帝国主义的伟大斗争的历史时代。以美国为首的帝国主义势力的各种侵略行为，不论是野蛮的镇压或欺骗的阴谋，都将继续起动员全世界人民起来反对帝国主义侵略者的作用。毛泽东同志指出：“帝国主义者的寿命不会很长了，因为他们尽做坏事，专门扶植各国反人民的反动派，霸占大量的殖民地、半殖民地和军事基地，以原子战争威胁和平。这样，他们就迫使全世界90％以上的人正在或者将要对他们群起而攻之。”（注十七）美帝国主义对古巴人民的滥施轰炸，法帝国主义在美国支持下对阿尔及利亚人民的血腥镇压，英国殖民主义者对赤手空拳的南非人民的野蛮屠杀，只能加深古巴人民、阿尔及利亚人民和南非人民对帝国主义的深仇大恨，只能激起更多的非洲人民和拉丁美洲人民起来同帝国主义斗争，只能引起社会主义力量和全世界所有爱好和平的人民对于古巴人民、阿尔及利亚人民和南非人民的同情和支援。帝国主义又用自己的行动造成自己越来越甚的孤立。今天的强者显然不是美国帝国主义而是六百五十万古巴人民；不是法帝国主义而是一千万阿尔及利亚人民；不是英帝国主义而是六十万阿曼人民。席卷亚非和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动必将进一步地高涨，和平力量必将进一步地压倒战争势力。
