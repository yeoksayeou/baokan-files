    How Jianhe County Transformed from Backward to Advanced
    The CCP Jianhe County Committee
    We haven't attended military academies, but we learned war from the revolutionary wars led by the Party. After the war ended, we had to engage in construction, but we haven't attended economic construction schools either. What should we do? We can only resolutely "learn by doing." Over the years, we have kept Chairman Mao's instruction in mind and strived to do so in accordance with the spirit of this instruction. We have always regarded studying Marxist-Leninist theory, studying Chairman Mao's works, and studying the Party's policies as an extremely important task.

    Chairman Mao told us in the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan": "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution." This is our guide for implementing the class line in our work. However, we didn't implement it very well from the beginning. Especially in the early days of liberation, there were many muddled ideas. At that time, some comrades were misled by the special nature of minority areas, and didn't pay serious attention to establishing the leadership advantages of poor and lower-middle peasants in grassroots work. From the perspective of the entire county, until 1955, the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants had not been established in 20% to 30% of the regions. This issue gave us a serious lesson in 1955. At that time, in Gedong Township, which borders Jianhe County and Taigong, a group of counter-revolutionaries, supported by a "ghost master," started to create an "emperor." Afterwards, we conducted a comprehensive investigation and analysis of the situation in Gedong Township. We found that the grassroots regime in this area was originally controlled by the five categories of elements [landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists] and prosperous middle peasants. A small number of prosperous middle peasants, dissatisfied with the policies of unified purchase and sales, were also exploited by the five categories of elements. We used this incident to conduct a major inspection of the county's work. From this lesson, we realized that the correct and firm implementation of the class line is the key to our success or failure in rural work. After this issue became clear in our thinking, the County Party Committee immediately proposed a firm action plan, leaving a few people in the office to take care of things, and the rest of the people went down to the grassroots and key areas to sweep the edges. The goal was to purify the grassroots Party organizations and political power, and fully mobilize the poor peasants to be masters of their own affairs. This resolute action was a turning point for Jianhe's work. In particular, Chairman Mao's analysis of the rural class situation in his speech "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" further strengthened our class line of establishing the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants in grassroots work. After continued efforts in 1956, the advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants had been basically established in all villages and stockades throughout the county.

    We firmly implemented the Party's class line in the countryside. The vast majority of rural Party members are of poor peasant origin, and the vast majority of Party core cadres above the branch secretary level are also poor and lower-middle peasants. One-third of the poor peasant class has become active in various production and technological innovations. These activists have all met the following three conditions: 1. They are of one heart with the Communist Party. 2. They work selflessly and do not care about rewards. 3. They have creativity and invention. From this, the conclusion that "without the poor and lower-middle peasants, there would be no Great Leap Forward in the countryside" is realistic.

    Chairman Mao's "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses and Attention to Working Methods" is the most familiar article among the cadres of our county and is another compass in the work of our County Party Committee. The lesson of the Gedong incident has given us a very deep understanding in this regard, so our transformation in work style is also relatively thorough.

    In the past few years, we have followed Chairman Mao's instructions, constantly fighting against bureaucracy and detachment from the masses. We have also realized from our practical work that this is one of the most important keys to fully mobilizing the masses to carry out revolutionary struggle. In Jianhe County, all areas where work is more advanced are areas where the relationship between cadres and the masses is better. In this regard, we first started with the members of the County Party Committee to set an example for the cadres. All the heroic and model figures in various tasks and production in the county have frequent contact with the County Party Committee. The direct contact between the County Party Committee cadres and the masses is also very close. Secondly, we repeatedly organized the study of Chairman Mao's "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses and Attention to Working Methods" among cadres at all levels, including cadres of production teams, so that the vast number of cadres could more deeply recognize the importance of this issue theoretically. From the perspective of cadres participating in physical labor in 1959, the average number of working days for each commune Party committee secretary was 180, and the average number of working days for each management district general branch secretary was 216. The average number of working days for each production team branch secretary was 288. The average number of working days for each county office cadre was 162. Doing well at eating, living, and working together with the masses.

    1959 was a year in which we achieved a special Great Leap Forward and made outstanding achievements. It was also a year in which the relationship between cadres and the masses and the relationship between superiors and subordinates was the best. The cadres all regarded caring for the masses as their bounden duty. Last year, the county organized several major inspections of living conditions. The cadre canteens below the commune level have been abolished. Every branch secretary, commune Party committee secretary, and even County Party Committee member personally took charge and led the operation of the canteens. Running the public canteens well has become the unanimous goal of the county's cadres. Last year, when winter came, the branch secretaries personally checked the winter preparations door-to-door. The county organized the processing of more than 3,000 sets of cotton clothes to help the commune members with thin clothing get through the winter. Party members and cadres also took the lead in repairing houses for the commune members, so that every household could have a warm house to spend the winter. Last winter, even in the coldest days, our production activities did not stop.

    Chairman Mao said in the article "Introducing a Cooperative": "The most prominent feature of China's 600 million people is that they are poor and blank. These seem like bad things, but in fact they are good things. Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, the desire to work, the desire for revolution." Chairman Mao's instruction gave us the greatest inspiration. Chairman Mao's thought enabled us to grasp the characteristic of "poor people have high aspirations" in our region and fully unleash the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses and cadres. It strengthened our determination and confidence in leading the people of the county to carry out the Great Leap Forward. We analyzed the natural conditions of our county with the broad masses and cadres, and fully recognized the favorable factors. We were determined to turn bad things into good things, bravely march into nature, develop production at high speed, change the face of the mountainous areas, turn poor mountains into granaries, oil lakes, and forests, establish ambitions in socialist construction, and strive for advancement.

    Based on the principle of continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary stages, we constantly put forward clear goals. In the spring, we focused on seizing the "early" opportunity. As soon as the sowing and transplanting were over, the word "management" was launched. As soon as the autumn harvest was over, we organized a small autumn harvest campaign. As soon as the mountain goods were brought down the mountain, we raised the issue of processing. Tightly linked, without letting go of a single step. So that the production enthusiasm and initiative of the masses are never diminished. And promptly study and summarize new things, humbly learn advanced experiences and advanced technologies, so that we do not become empty politicians and keep up with the development of the situation.

    We kept in mind that "contradictions constantly appear and are constantly resolved, which is the dialectical law of the development of things," constantly analyze and study the problems in our work, never be proud and complacent, boldly expose the shortcomings in our work, and quickly solve them. When we were unclear about new contradictions in our work, we often sought advice from theoretical books. When we once encountered difficulties in the grain work, we studied Lenin's "On the Grain Tax," and studied the Party Central Committee's and Chairman Mao's guidelines, policies, and instructions on grain issues. We deeply realized that the grain issue "is the most profound, most fundamental, most frequent, and most widespread struggle between capitalism and socialism." With this understanding, we took the initiative in grain work. In all our work, we also regard striving for initiative as a prerequisite for doing good work. We do not relax in anything and never let objective conditions hold us back.

    剑河县怎样从落后变为先进
    中共剑河县委会
    我们这些人没有进过军事学校，从党领导的革命战争中学会了战争。战争结束了要搞建设，我们也没有进过经济建设的学校，怎么办呢？只有坚决“干起来再学习”。这些年来我们牢记着毛主席的这个指示，并遵照这个指示的精神努力去做。一直把学习马克思列宁主义理论、学习毛主席的著作、学习党的方针政策，当作一项极重要的任务。
    毛主席在“湖南农民运动考察报告”中告诉我们：“没有贫农，便没有革命”，这是我们工作中执行阶级路线的指南。但是我们并不是一开始就执行得很好，特别是解放初期，存在过不少糊涂思想。那时，有的同志被少数民族地区特殊论所迷惑，在基层工作中，没有认真注意树立贫农和下中农优势。从全县来看，直到1955年以前，还有20％到30％的地区贫农下中农的领导优势没有树立起来。这一问题在1955年给了我们严重的教训。那时剑河县与台拱交界的革东乡，有一帮反革命分子，拥戴着一个“鬼师”闹起“皇帝”来了。事后我们对革东乡的情况进行了全面调查研究和分析。发现这个地区的基层政权原来掌握在五类分子和富裕中农的手中。少数富裕中农，由于对统购统销等政策不满，也被五类分子所利用。我们就这次事件对全县工作进行了一次大检查。从这个教训中，体会到正确、坚定贯彻阶级路线，是我们在农村工作中胜败的关键。当这问题在我们思想上明确以后，县委立即提出坚决的行动计划，机关里留几个人看家，其余人全下到基层和重点地区去扫边沿，工作目标是纯洁基层党组织和政权，充分发动贫农当家作主。这次的坚决行动，对于剑河的工作来说，是一个转折点。特别是毛主席在“关于农业合作化问题”讲话中对农村阶级情况的分析，更加坚定了我们在基层工作中树立贫农下中农优势的阶级路线。以后经过1956年的继续努力，全县各个村寨贫农和下中农的优势已基本树立起来。
    我们坚定的贯彻党在农村的阶级路线，农村党员绝大多数是贫农成份，分支书以上的党的核心干部中，绝大多数也是贫农下中农。贫农阶层中有三分之一成为各项生产与技术革新中的积极分子。这些积极分子都达到以下三个条件：一、与共产党一条心。二、忘我劳动，不计报酬。三、有创造发明。从这里得出“没有贫农下中农，就没有农村的大跃进”的结论，是切合实际的。
    毛主席写的“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”，是我们全县干部中最熟悉的一篇文章，是我们县委工作中的又一个指南针。革东事件的教训，使我们在这方面有极深的体会，因此，我们在作风上的转变也比较彻底。
    这几年中，我们遵循着毛主席的指示，不断的与官僚主义、脱离群众的现象进行斗争，我们从实际工作中也体会到这是充分发动群众进行革命斗争的最重要的关键之一。在剑河县凡是工作较先进的地区，都是干群关系较好的地区，在这方面我们首先从县委成员做起，给干部做表率。全县在各项工作和各项生产中的英雄模范人物，与县委更有着频繁的接触。县委干部与群众的直接联系也是很密切的。其次，我们在各级干部，直到生产队的干部中，反复组织学习毛主席的“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文，使广大干部从理论上更深刻地认识到该问题的重要性。从1959年干部参加体力劳动看，公社党委书记每人平均劳动日一百八十个，管理区总支书记每人平均劳动日二百一十六个。生产队分支书记平均每人劳动日二百八十八个。县机关干部每人平均劳动日一百六十二个。与群众同吃同住都做得较好。
    1959年是我们获得特大跃进，取得卓越成绩的一年，也是我们干群关系、上下级关系最好的一年，干部们都把关心群众当成自己的天职。去年，全县组织了几次生活大检查，公社以下的干部食堂都已取消，每个支部书记，公社党委书记，以至县委委员，都亲自挂帅，领导办食堂。办好公共食堂，成为全县干部的一致目标。去年入冬时，支部书记们都亲自挨门挨户进行过冬检查，全县有组织的加工了三千多套棉衣，帮助衣物单薄的社员过冬。党员和干部还带头替社员修补房屋，使每户都有暖和的房子过冬。去冬，即是在最严寒的日子，我们的生产活动都没有停顿。
    毛主席在“介绍一个合作社”一文中说：“中国六亿人口的显著特点是一穷二白，这些看起来是坏事，其实是好事。穷则思变，要干，要革命。”主席这指示，给了我们最大的启发，毛主席的思想，使我们掌握了我们地区“人穷志气高”的特点，充分发挥了广大群众和干部的革命热情。坚定了我们领导全县人民搞大跃进的决心和信心。我们与广大群众和干部一起分析我们县的自然条件，充分认识了有利因素。决心把坏事变好事，勇敢地向大自然进军。高速度发展生产，改变山区面貌，变穷山为粮仓油湖林海，在社会主义建设事业中树雄心，争上游。
    我们根据不断革命论与革命阶段论的原理，不断提出明确的奋斗目标，在春季提出抓“早”，播种插秧刚结束，“管”字就上马，秋收刚完，就组织小秋收运动，山货刚采下山，又提出加工问题。环环扣紧，一步不让。使群众的生产热情与积极性一时一刻也不低落。并且及时研究总结新事物，虚心学习先进经验先进技术，使自己不作空头政治家，跟上形势的发展。
    我们牢记着“矛盾不断出现，又不断解决，就是事物发展的辩证规律”，不断分析研究工作中的问题，永不骄傲自满，大胆揭露工作中的缺点，并迅速的加以解决。我们对工作中产生的新的矛盾认识不清时，也常求教于理论书籍。当我们曾一度在粮食工作问题上遇到困难时，就学习了列宁的“论粮食自由贸易”，学习了党中央和毛主席有关粮食问题方面的方针政策和指示。我们深刻的认识到，粮食问题“是一场资本主义与社会主义之间最深刻、最根本、最经常、最广泛的斗争。”有了这个认识，我们在粮食工作上，就采取了主动，在所有工作中，我们也都把争取主动，当成做好工作的先决条件。样样事情不放松，决不让客观条件扯住我们的后腿。
