In Anhui, Schistosomiasis is a local disease with the greatest harm and the widest spread. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, comprehensive measures with "converting paddy fields into dry land" as the key were adopted, and great achievements have been made in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis. At present, one county has completely eliminated schistosomiasis, several counties have basically eliminated schistosomiasis, and the epidemic areas in other counties have also been greatly reduced. Thanks to the development of schistosomiasis prevention and treatment, thousands of patients have recovered their health, and a new atmosphere of longevity and prosperity has emerged.

Joint speech by Wu Yanqiu, Jiao Mingluan, and Zhu Sui, members of the CPPCC National Committee.

Chairman, esteemed members:

We fully endorse the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong.

Currently, a patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the "Four Pests," promoting hygiene, and eliminating diseases is being carried out throughout the country. In Anhui Province, we are closely combining this campaign with the spring production season, creating a new high tide of the patriotic health movement. In this movement, eliminating local diseases, especially the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, is an extremely important task for our province. In recent years, Anhui Province has achieved brilliant results in schistosomiasis prevention and control. Although we are not engaged in health work, we cannot help but feel encouraged by witnessing such great achievements. Here, please allow us to give a brief speech to the conference on what we know about schistosomiasis prevention and control work in Anhui.

Before liberation, the areas where schistosomiasis was prevalent were: "Thousands of villages are desolate with people defecating everywhere, and tens of thousands of households are sparse, haunted by ghosts singing."

Schistosomiasis is a local disease in Anhui that causes the greatest harm and is the most widespread. In the early days of liberation, it was understood that 500,000 people were infected in the vast areas along the Yangtze River and in southern Anhui, and nearly 10 million people were directly threatened by this disease. Historically, the Kuomintang reactionaries only cared about squeezing the people's blood and sweat and did not care about their lives and deaths. They did not pay any attention to schistosomiasis, which led to the continuous spread of the disease and the increasing severity of the harm. Some agricultural areas with otherwise good natural conditions were sparsely populated and the fields were barren. Many villages saw their populations die out, resulting in the tragic scene of households and villages being wiped out. It was truly as Chairman Mao wrote in his poem "Farewell to the God of Plague": "Thousands of villages are desolate with people defecating everywhere, and tens of thousands of households are sparse, haunted by ghosts singing." For example, the villages of Xia Hongtang and Yangcunban in She County, and Fangjiayuan Village in Jixi County, in southern Anhui, were all villages with more than 100 households thirty years ago. Due to the prevalence of schistosomiasis, they had become uninhabited ruins by the time of liberation. Many villages, due to schistosomiasis infection, saw large numbers of men die, becoming veritable "widow villages." At that time, there was such a folk song in the schistosomiasis epidemic areas:

"Heroes cannot survive three winters; after three winters, the sock straps are cut short, the trouser belts are shortened and lengthened, sticking out big bellies, waiting to see the King of Hell."

After liberation, the Party and the government led the people of the whole province to carry out comprehensive prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis.

After liberation, the people in the schistosomiasis epidemic areas finally saw a savior in their suffering. The Communist Party and the People's Government led the people of the whole province to carry out comprehensive prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis. As early as the beginning of 1950, key investigations were carried out in the areas where the disease was prevalent, and prevention and treatment institutions such as prevention and treatment stations and prevention and treatment teams were established. In the epidemic areas, the Party committees at all levels established prevention and treatment leading groups, with the Party committee secretaries personally taking charge, leading the masses to vigorously carry out prevention and treatment work. In order to completely eliminate Oncomelania hupensis and eradicate schistosomiasis, the CPC Anhui Provincial Committee began to experiment with and gradually promote measures to convert paddy fields into dry land in the disease epidemic areas, starting in 1954. After the CPC Central Committee put forward the task of eliminating pests and diseases in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) in 1956, we in Anhui further widely mobilized the masses to promote the movement to eliminate schistosomiasis with the conversion of paddy fields into dry land as the key, combined with two managements and one elimination and treatment. According to years of experience, in terms of prevention and treatment measures, vigorously promoting the conversion of paddy fields into dry land and changing the farming system are the most effective measures to kill snails, reduce and avoid contact with epidemic water during production, and greatly reduce the infection rate. In the process of promoting the conversion of paddy fields into dry land, we also encountered the obstruction of some right-leaning conservatives. They said that production would definitely not be done well, harvests would definitely be reduced, the farming habits of the masses could not be changed, and the conversion of paddy fields into dry land was destined to fail. Some places simply couldn't bear to change, or didn't ask whether there were snails or not, and only changed bad land, not good land, and as a result, it affected the progress of eliminating schistosomiasis and production could not be done well. In view of this, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee separately convened on-site meetings in the paddy field conversion areas of She County and Guichi County. The facts of the on-site meeting fully proved that the conversion of paddy fields into dry land can both kill snails and eliminate diseases, and increase production. After two years of converting paddy fields into dry land in the Guilin Management Area of the Huizhou People's Commune in She County, the mortality rate of snails increased from 57.2% of artificial snail extermination before the conversion to 99.81%. The snail density also decreased from 0.17 snails per square chi before the conversion to 0.003 snails. The infection rate of residents also decreased from 77.3% in 1956 before the conversion to 6.8% in 1959. In terms of production, the yield per mu in this management area in 1959 was 804 jin, an increase of 11.6% over 720 jin in 1958, and an increase of 136% over 340 jin per mu before the conversion. The situation in all areas where paddy fields were converted into dry land was roughly the same as in the Guilin Management Area, which not only eliminated snails and eradicated diseases, but also greatly saved labor for snail extermination and increased production. Therefore, it solved the ideological problems of many cadres and won the active support of the broad masses. This year, the area of paddy fields converted into dry land has rapidly expanded to more than 600,000 mu. It is expected that after all epidemic areas realize the conversion of paddy fields into dry land this year, combined with comprehensive measures, schistosomiasis in our province can definitely be eliminated ahead of schedule. In some lake and swamp areas where dry land conversion is not possible, in addition to land reclamation to kill snails as in all lake and swamp areas across the country, we have also adopted the method of enclosing weirs to store water for fish farming to achieve the purpose of killing snails. In terms of snail extermination, the broad masses have also created and summarized the "ten-character method of snail extermination: drought, burial, reclamation, poisoning, retting, burning, scalding, piling, shoveling, sealing," and have made every effort to kill snails, achieving remarkable results. The snail extermination area has reached more than 400 million square meters. In terms of disease treatment, according to incomplete statistics, since liberation, a total of more than 17.96 million person-times of human feces have been tested, of which more than 12.98 million person-times have been tested since the Great Leap Forward, which is 2.6 times that of previous years; more than 507,000 patients have been treated (including re-treatment), of which more than 360,000 patients have been treated since the Great Leap Forward, which is 2.4 times that of previous years. In addition, draft cattle have been universally examined and treated, water sources and feces have been managed, and personal protection has been strengthened. Due to the comprehensive measures taken by our province with the conversion of paddy fields into dry land as the key, Taiping County in the province has completely eliminated schistosomiasis, several counties have basically eliminated schistosomiasis, and the epidemic areas in other counties have also been greatly reduced, enabling thousands of patients to recover their health. The situation where women could not bear children due to schistosomiasis infection in the past has changed. The population in the disease epidemic areas has increased significantly year by year since liberation, and agricultural production has also developed greatly. Everywhere is seeing off the God of Plague, and a new atmosphere of longevity and prosperity has emerged, fundamentally changing the past face. For example, in the Sangaida Brigade of Tangxi Commune in Guichi County, fifty years ago, there were eleven villages with more than 4,000 households. Due to the harm of schistosomiasis, only three villages with 188 households remained by the eve of liberation, of which 153 households had only recently moved from other counties before liberation. Nianzi Village originally had 120 households, but only Cao Yuquan's family remained by the eve of liberation, and three of the four members of his family suffered from schistosomiasis. After liberation, after vigorous prevention and treatment, especially after the conversion of paddy fields into dry land in 1954, all snails in the fields were killed, and more than 480 patients were treated. Among them, 154 people who had lost their labor force due to illness in the past have now become production experts. In recent years, 81 babies have been born, and production has also greatly developed. In the past three years, 284 mu of abandoned land have been reclaimed. Last year, the total grain output increased by nearly 2.5 times compared with 1953 before the conversion of paddy fields into dry land. Therefore, the commune members summarized the ten major changes in this brigade compared with the past: "Big bellies have become small bellies; thin people have become fat people; short people have become tall people; no labor force has become a labor force; poor teams have become rich teams; single men have become couples; no childbearing has become childbearing; wasteland has become fertile land; grain-deficient teams have become grain-surplus teams; backwardness has become advancement."

Hundreds of millions of people in disease epidemic areas sing in unison: "Chairman Mao is truly wise, the Communist Party is the savior, leading the people to drive away the God of Plague, eradicating the century-old disease, sweeping away the millennia-old poverty, increasing production in the fields, increasing longevity for the people, and boundless joy for longevity and prosperity."

In short, in recent years, the schistosomiasis prevention and control work in Anhui Province has gone through repeated struggles, and the achievements have been enormous. The experience of fighting against schistosomiasis is also extremely rich. This is an aspect of the contribution made by the people of our province to the socialist construction cause of the motherland under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory for the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune. Just as hundreds of millions of people in the disease epidemic areas sing in unison:

"Chairman Mao is truly wise, the Communist Party is the savior, leading the people to drive away the God of Plague, eradicating the century-old disease, sweeping away the millennia-old poverty, increasing production in the fields, increasing longevity for the people, and boundless joy for longevity and prosperity."

We believe that in the future, under the guidance of the principle of converting paddy fields into dry land and adopting comprehensive prevention and treatment measures to completely eliminate schistosomiasis, the people of Anhui will surely fulfill the task of eliminating schistosomiasis as stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule on the schistosomiasis prevention and control front.

    安徽处处送瘟神
    血吸虫病是安徽省危害最大的流行最广的一种地方病。解放后，在党和人民政府的领导下，采取了“以水改旱”为纲的综合措施，在防治血吸虫病方面，已取得很大成绩。目前，已有一个县彻底消灭了血吸虫病，几个县基本上消灭了血吸虫病，其余各县的流行区也大大缩小。由于血吸虫病防治工作的开展，使成千上万患者恢复了健康，出现了人寿年丰、欣欣向荣的新气象。
    吴彦求　焦鸣銮　朱　遂委员的联合发言主席、各位委员：
    我们完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理和陈叔通副主席所作的报告。
    目前，全国各地正在开展一个以除四害、讲卫生，消灭疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动，我们安徽全省也正在紧密地结合着春季大生产，掀起了一个爱国卫生运动的新高潮。在爱国卫生运动中，消灭地方病特别是防治血吸虫病，更是我省一项极为重要的任务。几年来，安徽省在血防工作方面，已经获得了辉焊的成绩。虽然我们都不是搞卫生工作的，但目睹这种巨大成就，不能不感到欢欣鼓舞，在这里请允许我们，对安徽的血防工作，就我们所知道的一些情况，向大会作一简要的发言。解放前，流行血吸虫病地区是：“千村薜苈人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌”
    血吸虫病是我们安徽危害最大，流行最广的一种地方病，解放初，在长江两岸和皖南广大地区，被感染的据了解有五十万人，直接受到这种病害威胁的将近一千万人。历史上，由于国民党反动派只顾压榨人民血汗，不顾人民死活，对血吸虫病根本不加过问，以至蔓延地区越来越广，病害程度越来越深。使一些自然条件本来很好的农业地区，也是人烟稀少，田园荒芜，有不少村庄人口死亡殆尽，造成绝户、绝村的惨景，真是如毛主席在送瘟神的诗中所写的那样：“千村薜苈人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌”。如皖南歙县的下洪塘、杨村坂，绩溪县的方家园等村庄，三十年前原都是有一百多户人家的村子，由于血吸虫病的流行，到解放前均变成了荒无人烟的废墟。也有许多村庄，由于血吸虫病的感染，使大批男人死亡，成了名副其实的“寡妇村”。当时，在血吸虫病流行地区有着这样一首歌谣：
    “好汉难过三冬，过了三冬，袜带长剪短，裤带短接长，挺着大肚子，等着见阎王。”
    解放后，党和政府领导全省人民对血吸虫病进行了全面的防治工作
    解放以后，在血吸虫病流行地区的人民，才从苦难中盼到了救星，共产党和人民政府领导着全省人民对血吸虫病进行了全面的防治工作。早在1950年初，就在病害流行地区进行了重点调查，建立了防治所、防治站和防治组等防治机构，在流行地区的各级党委，都成立了防治的领导小组，由党委书记亲自挂帅，领导群众大力地开展防治工作。为了彻底消灭钉螺，根除血吸虫病害，从1954年开始，中共安徽省委就在病害流行地区试验和逐步推广水田改旱地的措施。1956年中共中央在全国农业发展纲要（草案）中提出除害灭病的任务以后，我们安徽就进一步广泛的发动群众，推行以水改旱为纲结合两管一灭和治病的消灭血吸虫病运动。根据几年来的经验，在防治措施方面，大力推广水田改旱地，改变耕作制度，是灭杀钉螺，减少和避免在生产中接触疫水，大大降低感染率的最为有效的措施。在推行水改旱的过程中，也曾遇到过一些右倾保守分子的阻碍，他们说什么水改旱后生产一定搞不好，收成一定要降低，群众的耕作习惯不能改变，水改旱注定要失败等等。有些地方根本舍不得改，或不问有无钉螺，只改孬地，不改好地，因而结果影响了消灭血吸虫病的进度，生产也搞不好。省委和省人委有鉴于此，乃分别在歙县、贵池两县水改旱地区召集现场会。现场会的事实充分证明，水改旱后既能杀螺灭病，又能增产。歙县徽州人民公社桂林管理区水田改旱地后，经过两年，钉螺死亡率由改旱前人工灭螺的57.2％上升到99.81％，钉螺密度也由改旱前的每平方市尺零点一七只，下降为零点零零三只；居民感染率也由改旱前1956年的77.3％下降为1959年的6.8％；在生产方面，这个管理区1959年的亩产量为八百零四斤，比1958年七百二十斤增产11.6％，比改旱前的亩产三百四十斤增产136％。所有水改旱地区的情况和桂林管理区大体相同，不仅消灭了钉螺，根除了病害，而且大大节约了灭螺劳力，增加了产量。因而解决了许多干部的思想问题，取得广大群众的积极拥护。今年水改旱面积迅速扩大到六十多万亩，预计所有病区实现了今年的水改旱以后，再结合综合措施，我省的血吸虫病肯定可以提前消灭的。在有些湖沼地区不能改旱的地方，除了和全国各湖沼地区一样进行围垦灭螺外，我们还采取了圈圩蓄水养鱼的办法，达到灭螺目的。在灭螺方面，广大群众还创造和总结了“旱、埋、垦、毒、沤、烧、烫、堆、铲、封”的灭螺十字法，千方百计的杀灭钉螺，获得了显著成效，灭螺面积达四亿多平方米。在治病方面，根据不完全的统计，解放以来，共检验人粪一千七百九十六万余人次，其中大跃进以来就检验了一千二百九十八万余人次，为以往几年的二点六倍；治疗病人五十万七千余人（包括复治的），其中大跃进以来就治疗病人三十六万余人，为以往几年的二点四倍。此外，还普遍查、治了耕牛，水源和粪便都进行了管理并加强了个人防护。由于我省采取了上述以水改旱为纲的综合措施，全省已有一个太平县彻底消灭了血吸虫病，有几个县已基本上消灭了血吸虫病，其余各县流行区也大大缩小，使成千上万的病人恢复了健康，过去妇女由于感染了血吸虫病不能生育的情况已经改变，病害流行地区的人口，解放后逐年都有显著增加，农业生产也有了很大发展，处处都在送瘟神，出现了人寿年丰、欣欣向荣的新气象，根本改变了过去的面貌。如贵池县棠溪公社的三改大队，五十年前，有十一个村庄，四千多户人家，由于血吸虫病的危害，到解放前夕，只剩下三个村庄，一百八十八户，其中一百五十三户还是解放前不久从外县迁来的。碾子下村当年原有一百二十户，解放前夕只剩下曹玉全一户，而且全家四口，就有三人患血吸虫病。解放后，经过大力防治，特别是五四年进行了水改旱后，灭杀了田中所有钉螺，治疗病人四百八十余人，其中有一百五十四人过去因病已丧失劳动力的，现在都变成了生产能手，几年来出生婴儿八十一人，生产也大大发展，三年来开垦了二百八十四亩抛荒田，去年粮食总产量比改旱前的五三年增加了近二点五倍。因而该社社员总结了这个大队与过去对比，有十大变化，就是：“大肚子变成了小肚子；瘦子变成了胖子；矮子变成了长子；无劳力变成了有劳力；穷队变成了富队；单身汉变成了夫妻双双；不生育变成了生育；荒地变成了良田；缺粮队变成了余粮队；落后变成先进。”
    病害流行地区千百万人民同声歌颂：“毛主席真英明，共产党是救星，领导人民赶瘟神，百年病害连根拔，千年穷根一扫尽，田增产，人添寿，人寿年丰乐无穷”
    总之，几年来，我们安徽省血防工作经过反复斗争，成绩是巨大的，与血吸虫病作斗争的经验也是极为丰富的，这是我省人民在共产党和毛主席的领导下，为祖国的社会主义建设事业作出贡献的一个方面。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社三个万岁的伟大胜利。正如病害流行地区千百万人民同声歌颂的：
    “毛主席真英明，共产党是救星，领导人民赶瘟神，百年病害连根拔，千年穷根一扫尽，田增产，人添寿，人寿丰年乐无穷。”
    我们相信，今后安徽人民在以水改旱为纲，采取综合防治措施，彻底消灭血吸虫病的方针下，在血防战线上，一定会提前实现农业发展纲要所规定的消灭血吸虫病的任务。（附图片）
