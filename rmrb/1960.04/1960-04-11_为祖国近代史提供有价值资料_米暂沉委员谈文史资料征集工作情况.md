I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee, as well as Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 national economic plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national financial statement and the draft 1960 national budget.

I work in the Committee for the Study of Historical and Literary Materials of the CPPCC National Committee. Now, in connection with my own work, I would like to talk about my personal understanding and experiences regarding the work on historical and literary materials.

**Achievements**

Thanks to the Party's attention and concern, as well as the assistance of relevant parties, the Committee for the Study of Historical and Literary Materials has collected 2.9 million characters of historical materials in the eight months since its establishment. Many of these are valuable first-hand historical materials, providing valuable research materials for the history of our country in recent decades.

After the closing of the last plenary session of this conference, Chairman Zhou Enlai invited committee members over the age of sixty to a tea party, calling on everyone to record the historical events they had personally experienced and pass them on to future generations. Based on this instruction, the Standing Committee of this conference decided to establish the Committee for the Study of Historical and Literary Materials to be responsible for planning, organizing, and promoting the writing and collection of various historical materials from the late Qing Dynasty to before the national liberation. After the Committee for the Study of Historical and Literary Materials was established in late July last year, it formulated working methods and reference topics for collecting materials, and began the collection work. (The working methods, reference topics, and committee list have been included in the first and second collections of historical and literary materials, respectively.) Thanks to the Party's attention and concern, the assistance of relevant parties, and the support of relevant people, 2.9 million characters of historical materials have been collected in the past eight months, including 500,000 characters of original materials and 2.4 million characters of historical materials manuscripts written by committee members and relevant people from various fields. If all the materials are classified by category, historical events account for the most, about 55%; the rest are about 10% related to old military and political factions, about 14% related to historical figures, about 8% related to diplomacy, and about 13% related to economy, culture, society, and other aspects. If classified by the historical period to which the content of the materials belongs, all the materials related to the Kuomintang rule period account for the most, about 56%, while those related to the Qing Dynasty rule period and the Beiyang government rule period are roughly equal, each accounting for 22%.

In order to better preserve and accumulate the collected materials, and to further promote the development of the work of writing materials, the Committee for the Study of Historical and Literary Materials decided in October last year to edit the "Selected Historical and Literary Materials", each collection containing about 100,000 characters. Now, four collections of this selection have been compiled, and three collections have been published and distributed to all committee members. A total of 51 historical material manuscripts have been included in the four collections, and the content is mostly related to the Kuomintang regime rule period, accounting for more than 50%.

In addition to the 400,000-character historical material manuscripts included in the selection, there are also about 300,000 characters of manuscripts with historical value. Except for a part of them that are not suitable for publication at present, the rest are also planned to be included in the selection successively. The manuscripts that have been included in the selection and the above-mentioned part of the manuscripts (a total of more than 700,000 characters, accounting for 30% of the total number of historical material manuscripts) are mostly manuscripts written by the authors based on their personal experiences and observations, which have first-hand historical value. Many of them can boldly expose the truth of certain historical events in which the authors themselves participated, providing valuable research materials for the history of our country in recent decades.

After the publication of the three collections of "Selected Historical and Literary Materials", judging from some feedback we have initially collected and the requests from all parties for free copies or subscriptions from Xinhua Bookstore, this publication has been valued by all relevant parties. It not only provides reference materials for modern historical research work in a timely manner, but also will play an increasingly significant role in promoting the development of the work of writing historical materials. However, the work of historical and literary materials is a new work, we still lack experience, and there are still many shortcomings. We hope that all committee members will put forward criticisms at any time to help us improve our work and continuously improve the quality of the selections.

**Problems**

The problems that need to be solved at present are, first of all, that the quality of historical material manuscripts is not high enough, and further efforts should be made; secondly, the scope of content involved is not wide enough, and it needs to be widely organized and explored from many aspects; thirdly, it is necessary to broaden the source of manuscripts and expand the author team.

In the past eight months, the work of collecting historical materials by this committee has made preliminary progress and achieved certain results, but there are still many problems to be solved. The main problems that exist at present are, first of all, that the quality of historical material manuscripts varies, and the manuscripts with better content and first-hand historical value only account for 30%, which needs to be improved through efforts. Secondly, the content involved in the manuscripts we have received and included in the selection is not wide enough. Most of them are historical events in the political and military fields, while there are very few manuscripts in the economic, cultural, and social life fields, which need to be widely organized and explored from many aspects. Again, the source of manuscripts is currently basically limited to Beijing, and it is necessary to establish contact with local CPPCCs and relevant departments to open up sources of manuscripts nationwide. Finally, since this work has not been carried out for a long time, many people with rich experience have not been mobilized, and it is urgent for us to carry out in-depth and meticulous publicity and mobilization work.

Regarding the requirements for writing historical material manuscripts, we have proposed that writers can write without regard to viewpoint, without limitation to style, and without seeking completeness, but they must be based on personal experience and observations, and the facts and content must be true and specific. According to the work experience in this stage, the manuscripts written by those who can overcome concerns and write truthfully based on their own personal experiences and observations are mostly manuscripts with better content and first-hand historical value, and they are also often the results of our mobilization, organization, and in-depth exploration. Therefore, in order to effectively improve the quality of historical material manuscripts, we must, on the one hand, take active measures to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity, mobilization, and organization work; on the other hand, for writers, they must first have a clear understanding of the important significance of this work, eliminate all unnecessary concerns, and boldly write out the historical truth they have personally experienced. Secondly, some writers, in the process of writing historical materials, in addition to appropriately consulting some necessary literature records to help recall and verify facts, also conduct visits and conversations with relevant people who are familiar with the situation (such as those who participated together at that time or those who were on the opposite side at that time), so as to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of certain factual truths that they did not know at the time. In this way, the content of the historical materials they write can be made richer and more detailed. This is also a good experience worth promoting. As for better and more effective methods, it is to organize according to various aspects and systems, give play to the collective strength, and work together to carry out work in a planned and step-by-step manner.

**This Year's Plan**

This year, we plan to collect 5 million characters of historical materials, and strive to reach 40% of the manuscripts with historical value. We hope that relevant people will actively write manuscripts and truthfully write out the historical events they have personally experienced, and jointly complete this meaningful work.

The Committee for the Study of Historical and Literary Materials recently held its third plenary session, summarized the work of the eight months since its establishment, and adopted the 1960 work plan, preparing to collect 5 million characters of historical materials this year, and strive to reach 40% of the manuscripts with historical value; publish ten to twelve collections of "Selected Historical and Literary Materials", and strive to select several long historical material manuscripts to publish single-volume books. In order to ensure the completion of the above-mentioned planned targets, some measures have also been proposed to strengthen mobilization, liaison, and organization work, and strengthen liaison and cooperation with various relevant departments and local CPPCCs.

In the past stage, many committee members and relevant people have shown high enthusiasm for the work of collecting historical materials, had a correct understanding, and wrote many valuable historical material manuscripts. They believe that the historical events they have personally experienced in the past, although some have played a positive role in the development of our society, and some have played a negative role, but now truthfully recording the truth of these events and providing real and detailed materials for historical researchers is a positive contribution to the new society. For example, Committee Member Li Genyuan, who is eighty-two years old, recently wrote a memoir about the Political Science Society, which is as long as 20,000 characters, and expressed his inner excitement in the process of writing in sincere and moving language in the concluding remarks of the article. He said: "In order to respond to Premier Zhou's call, I wrote this memoir about the Political Science Society; recalling the past events of the Political Science Society has increased my love for the new society. In the past, foreign troubles were frequent, and warlords were rampant. Patriotic people were worried. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, our country can finally achieve prosperity and strength, and the people can live in peace, sweeping away the heavy haze of old China and ushering in a new era of clear skies and brilliance. How can an old man of eighty-two not be delighted?" This passage of Li Genyuan vividly reflects the feelings of many elderly people who have experienced the vicissitudes of life, and also fully illustrates that people with rich experience record their past personal experiences and observations, which not only make valuable contributions to our country's historical research work and the education of our future generations, but also for themselves, they can feel the happiness they are currently enjoying more deeply from the comparison of the past and the present they have personally experienced, and more firmly determine their determination and confidence to follow the Party on the road of socialism.

Committee members, the work of historical and literary materials is an important task of the Party. It is of great significance for studying modern history and educating future generations. Many of you committee members have rich personal experiences that can be used as historical materials, and you will have a lot of historical materials in the people you are familiar with. We hope that all committee members will actively participate in the work of writing historical materials, and will be able to mobilize the relevant people you are familiar with to also engage in writing, and jointly make contributions to this meaningful work.

### 为祖国近代史提供有价值资料  米暂沉委员谈文史资料征集工作情况

    为祖国近代史提供有价值资料
    米暂沉委员谈文史资料征集工作情况
    我完全同意并衷心拥护陈叔通副主席政协常务委员会的工作报告。李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。
    我在政协全国委员会文史资料研究委员会工作，现在想结合我自己本身的业务，就文史资料工作讲一下我个人所了解的情况和体会。已取得的成绩
    由于党的重视和关怀、以及有关方面的协助、文史资料研究委员会成立八个月以来，已征集到二百九十万字的史料，其中不少都具有第一手史料价值，为祖国近几十年的历史，提供了有价值的研究资料。
    本会上次全体会议闭幕之后，周恩来主席邀集六十岁以上的委员举行茶会，号召大家把亲身经历的历史事件记录下来，传之后代。本会常务委员会根据这一指示，决定设立文史资料研究委员会，来负责计划、组织和推动从清末到全国解放前这一时期的各种历史资料的撰写和征集工作。文史资料研究委员会去年7月下旬成立以后，即拟定了工作办法和征集资料参考题目，开始进行征集工作。（工作办法、参考题目和委员会名单已经分别载入文史资料选辑第一、二辑）由于党的重视和关怀、有关方面的协助以及有关人士的支持，八个月来，已经征集到二百九十万字的史料，其中原始资料有五十万字，本会委员和各方面有关人士所写的史料稿件有二百四十万字。全部资料如按照类别来区分，以历史事件方面的为最多，约占55％；其余属于旧军政派系方面的约占10％，属于历史人物方面的约占14％，属于外交方面的约占8％，属于经济、文化、社会等等其他方面的约占13％。如以资料内容所系的历史时期来划分，全部资料以属于国民党统治时期的为最多，约占56％，属于清朝统治时期的和属于北洋政权统治时期的，约略相等，各占22％。
    为了更好地保存和积累所收到的资料，并进一步推动资料撰写工作的开展，文史资料研究委员会在去年10月间决定编辑“文史资料选辑”，每辑约十万字左右。现在这个选辑已经编就四辑，并且已经出版了三辑，分送给各位委员。综计四辑共编入史料稿件五十一篇，其内容以属于国民党政权统治时期的为最多，约占50％以上。
    除了编入选辑的四十万字的史料稿件以外，还约有三十多万字有史料价值的稿件，除了其中有一部分目前还不宜于发表以外，其余也准备陆续编入选辑。已经编入选辑的稿件和上述这一部分稿件（共约七十多万字，占全部史料稿件总字数的30％），大都是撰稿人根据亲身经历和见闻所写的具有第一手史料价值的稿件，其中有不少能够大胆地揭露出有撰稿人自己参加在内的某些历史事件的真相，为我们祖国近几十年来的历史提供有价值的研究资料。
    “文史资料选辑”出版了三辑以后，根据我们初步收集得来的一些反映以及各方面要求赠阅或者向新华书店要求订阅的情况来看，这个刊物是受到各有关方面的重视的。它不仅为近代历史的研究工作及时地提供了参考资料，而且在推动史料撰写工作的开展方面，也将会发挥日益显著的作用。但是文史资料工作是一项新的工作，我们还缺乏经验，缺点还不少，希望各位委员随时提出批评，帮助我们改进工作并不断地提高选辑的质量。存在的问题
    目前需要解决的问题，首先是史料稿件的质量还不够高，应作进一步努力；其次，内容所涉及的范围还不广，有待于从多方面来进行广泛的组织和发掘；第三，需要广开稿源，扩大作者队伍。
    八个月来，本会的史料征集工作已经有了初步的开展，取得了一定的成绩，但是还有不少问题需要解决。目前存在的几个主要问题，首先是史料稿件的质量参差不齐，内容较好，具有第一手史料价值的稿件还只占30％，需要努力来提高。其次，我们所收到的以及编入选辑的稿件，内容所涉及的范围还不广，绝大部分是属于政治、军事方面的历史事件，而经济、文化、社会生活等方面的稿件还很少，有待于从多方面来进行广泛的组织和发掘。再次，稿件来源目前基本上还局限于北京，有待于同各地政协和有关部门建立联系，在全国范围内开辟稿源。最后，由于这项工作开展还不久，不少具有丰富阅历的人士还没有发动起来，迫切需要我们进行深入细致的宣传动员工作。
    关于撰写史料稿件的要求，我们曾经提出，撰写者可以不拘观点，不限体裁，不求完整，但是必须以亲身经历和见闻为依据，事实内容必须真实、具体。根据这一阶段的工作经验，凡是能够破除顾虑，根据自己的亲身经历和见闻秉笔直书所写成的稿件，大都是内容较好、具有第一手史料价值的稿件，同时也往往是经过我们动员、组织和深入发掘的成果。因此，为了能够有效地提高史料稿件的质量，必须一方面采取积极措施来进行广泛而深入的宣传动员和组织工作；另一方面，就撰稿人来说，必须首先对这个工作的重要意义有明确的认识，消除种种不必要的顾虑，大胆地把自己亲身经历过的历史真相如实地写出来。其次，有些撰稿人在撰写史料的过程中，除了适当地查阅一些必要的文献记载来帮助回忆和核对事实之外，还向熟悉情况的有关人士（例如当时共同参加过的或者当时作为自己的对手的一方的人士等等）进行访问交谈，从而获得了比较全面的、自己当时所不知道的某些事实真相，这样，就可以使自己所写的史料内容更加丰富翔实。这也是一个值得推广的好经验。至于更好、更有效的办法，则是按照各个方面、各个系统组织起来，发挥集体的力量，通力协作，有计划、有步骤地来进行工作。今年的计划
    今年准备征集史料五百万字，争取有史料价值的稿件达到40％。希望有关人士踊跃撰稿，把自己亲身经历的历史事件如实地写出来，共同完成这一有意义的工作。
    文史资料研究委员会最近举行了第三次全体委员会议，总结了从成立以来八个月的工作，并且通过了1960年工作计划，准备在今年内征集史料五百万字，争取有史料价值的稿件达到40％；出版“文史资料选辑”十至十二辑，并争取选择若干长篇的史料稿件出版单行本数种。为了保证完成上述计划指标，还提出了一些措施来加强动员、联系和组织工作，加强与各有关部门、各地方政协的联系和协作。
    在过去这一阶段中，许多委员和有关方面人士对于史料征集工作表现了高度的热情，有了正确的认识，写出了不少有价值的史料稿件。他们认为，自己过去曾经亲身经历的历史事件，虽然对于我国社会的发展有的起了积极作用，也有的起了消极作用，但是现在把这些事件的真相如实地纪录下来，为历史研究工作者提供真实详尽的资料，这就对于新社会有了积极的贡献。例如八十二高龄的李根源委员，最近写了一篇长达两万字的关于政学会的回忆录，并且在文章的结束语中以真挚动人的语言表达了他在撰写过程中内心的激动。他说：“我为了响应周总理的号召，写下了这篇对政学会的回忆；由于回忆政学会的往事，更加增加我对于新社会的热爱。过去外患频仍，军阀恣睢，爱国之士，莫不忧心如焚。今天我国在共产党的领导下，始能臻于国势富强、万民康阜之境，使旧中国的重重阴霾一扫而空，出现了一个万里晴空、光辉灿烂的新时代。八二老翁，能不欢欣鼓舞。”李根源委员这一段话生动地反映了许多饱经世变的老年人士们的心情，同时也充分说明，具有丰富阅历的人士们，把过去的亲身经历和见闻纪录下来，不仅对于我们祖国的历史研究工作、对于我们后代的教育，作了有价值的贡献，而且对于自己本身来说，也能够从亲身所经历的今昔对比中更加感到目前所身受的幸福，更加坚定了跟着党走社会主义道路的决心和信心。
    各位委员，文史资料工作是党的一项重要工作，它对研究近代历史和教育后一代都具有重要意义。各位委员许多人都有丰富的亲身经历可作为历史资料，在自己所熟悉的人士中掌握有历史资料也会不少。我们希望各位委员踊跃参加撰写历史资料工作，并能够动员自己熟悉的有关人士也从事撰写，共同来为这一有意义的工作作出贡献。（附图片）
