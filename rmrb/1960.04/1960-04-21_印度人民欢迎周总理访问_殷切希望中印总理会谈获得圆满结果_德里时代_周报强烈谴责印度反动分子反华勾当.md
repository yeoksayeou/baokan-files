Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 19th. Some Indian newspapers and periodicals continue to publish editorials welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and earnestly hope that the meeting between the Chinese and Indian Premiers will achieve positive results.

    The most recent issue of the Tamil-language "People's Power" weekly published an editorial saying that millions of Indian people welcome Premier Zhou Enlai, the leader of the friendly Chinese people, to visit India. The editorial stated that the Indian people "earnestly hope that the talks between Nehru and Zhou Enlai will achieve satisfactory results."

    In an editorial entitled "The Talks Must Succeed," the weekly pointed out that these talks "are of great significance not only to us and to China but also to the continued maintenance of world peace."

    The weekly stated that the Chinese People's Government has always considered the Indian government and people to be one of its best friends. Premier Zhou Enlai has reiterated this friendship and reaffirmed his firm belief that the temporary clouds between China and India will soon dissipate and that the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples will eventually shine brilliantly. It pointed out that the unity of China and India is a powerful barrier against imperialists' attempts to reconquer Asia and Africa.

    The latest issue of the "Delhi Times" weekly carried a prominent report on its front page stating that people are now eagerly hoping that the Premiers of China and India will resolve the differences between the two countries on the border issue and find a satisfactory solution that conforms to the interests of the people of both countries.

    The report heartily welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai's recent speech at the National People's Congress, especially his statement that he hoped his talks with Premier Nehru would "achieve positive results." It pointed out that "this is a welcome sentiment of friendly cooperation and mutual understanding."

    The report concluded, "It is generally known that most of the current disputes are left over from historical events under foreign imperialist rule. Foreign rulers had their own conspiracies and plans to satisfy their imperial interests. With India and China gaining independence, the problem, in a sense, still exists in some form, and the current talks are aimed at establishing a new relationship on a permanent basis, with the leaders of the two countries mutually agreeing to make necessary adjustments."

    This issue of the "Delhi Times" weekly also published a commentary strongly condemning the anti-China activities of Indian reactionaries who are using the Sino-Indian border issue.

    The commentary said that the anti-China activities of reactionaries in India, who are using the Sino-Indian border dispute to attack China and create discord and hostility between the two neighboring countries, will certainly not benefit India's fundamental interests.

    The commentary said, "China is making great strides in national construction. Indians should feel proud and happy about such amazing achievements made in such a short period of time. China should not be the object of our envy but the object of our emulation, not the object of hatred but the object of friendship." The commentary stated that China and India, as well as all well-meaning people in Asia and Africa, unanimously hope to eliminate the current misunderstandings between China and India and to achieve a happy, friendly, and permanent resolution of the border issue between the two countries.

    The Punjabi-language "New Century," the organ of the Punjab organization of the Communist Party of India, published an editorial today welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and hoping that the meeting between the Premiers of China and India will be fruitful.

    The editorial said: "The reactionary forces in India do not want to resolve the border dispute, but the democratic forces and the working masses urgently demand a solution to this problem, because once this problem is resolved, these two great countries can help each other implement their construction plans."

    印度人民欢迎周总理访问
    殷切希望中印总理会谈获得圆满结果
    “德里时代”周报强烈谴责印度反动分子反华勾当
    新华社新德里19日电　印度一些报刊继续发表社论，欢迎周恩来访问印度，并且殷切希望中印两国总理的会晤获得积极的成果。
    最近一期的泰米尔文“人民力量”周报发表社论说，千百万印度人民欢迎友好的中国人民的领导人周恩来总理访问印度。社论说，印度人民“热切地希望尼赫鲁和周恩来之间的会谈获得圆满结果”。
    这家周报在以“会谈必须成功”为题的社论中指出，这次会谈“不仅对我们和对中国有重要意义，而且对继续保持世界和平也有重要意义”。
    这家周报说，中国人民政府始终认为，印度政府和人民是它的最好的朋友之一。周恩来总理已经重申了这种友谊，并且重申了关于中印之间暂时的阴云即将驱散和中印两国人民的传统友谊终将放出灿烂的光芒的坚定信念。它指出，中印两国的团结，是对付帝国主义者企图重新征服亚洲和非洲的强大的屏障。
    最近一期的“德里时代”周报在第一版以显著地位刊载的一条报道说，现在人们殷切地希望中印两国总理会解决两国之间的在边界问题上的分歧，而且找到一个符合两国人民利益的圆满解决办法。
    这条报道衷心地欢迎周恩来总理最近在全国人民代表大会上的讲话，特别是他说的他希望他和尼赫鲁总理的会谈将会“取得积极的结果”这句话。它指出，“这是希望友好合作和互相谅解的可喜的感情”。
    这条报道最后说，“人们普遍知道，现在的争端大部分是外国帝国主义统治的历史事件中遗留下来的，外国统治者有它自己的满足它的帝国利益的阴谋和计划。随着印度和中国获得独立，在某种意义上，问题仍然以某种形式存在着，而目前的会谈是要在永久的基础上，在两国领袖互相同意作必要调整的情况下建立新的关系。”
    这一期“德里时代”周报还发表了一篇评论，强烈谴责印度反动分子利用中印边界问题进行反华的勾当。
    评论说，印度国内的反动分子利用中印边界争端攻击中国，制造中印两个邻国之间的不和和敌意，这肯定不会有益于印度的根本利益。
    评论说，“中国正在国家建设方面大步前进。印度人对于在这样短的时间内所取得的这样惊人的成就应该感到骄傲和高兴。中国不应该是我们嫉妒的对象，而应该是我们仿效的对象，不应该是仇恨的对象，而应该是友好的对象。”评论说，印中两国以及亚非所有怀着好心的人都一致希望能消除中印两国目前的误解，并且可喜的、友好的和永久的解决两国的边界问题。
    印度共产党旁遮普组织的机关报旁遮普文“新世纪报”今天发表社论，欢迎周恩来总理访问印度，并希望中印两国总理的会晤将取得成果。
    社论说：“印度的反动势力不想解决边界争端，但是民主势力和劳动群众迫切要求解决这个问题，因为这个问题一旦得到解决，这两个大国就可以互相帮助执行他们的建设计划。”
