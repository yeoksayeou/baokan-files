Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 6th: A U.S. representative participating in the Fourth Congress of the Cuban Socialist Youth League stated to the congress this afternoon that the American people abhor aggression against Cuba.

The U.S. representative said that the friendship between the youth and people of the United States and Cuba has been established in the struggle against their common enemy—the U.S. imperialist monopoly capitalist groups. The U.S. monopoly capitalist groups armed Batista in the past, and are now bombing Cuban sugarcane fields, while attempting to drag the American people into war. He emphasized that the American people do not want war. He said that the American Black youth, who are now fighting against racial discrimination, praise the Cuban revolutionary government's measures against racial discrimination and the appointment of Black people to senior positions in the government and the rebel army. He concluded by saying: We are willing to develop the friendship between Cuba and the United States in a peaceful world.

Representatives from Canada, Romania, the German Democratic Republic, France, Dominica, and Nicaragua conveyed the support of the youth and people of their countries for the Cuban revolution to the congress, and condemned the U.S. imperialist criminal conspiracies against the Cuban revolution.

Representatives from the Cuban July 26th Movement and the United Front of Rebel Youth successively spoke at the congress, expressing their firm advocacy for continuously strengthening the unity between the revolutionary forces of Cuban youth and all the people to defend national sovereignty. They paid tribute to the representatives of Latin American countries, whose people are registering as volunteers to fight against imperialist aggression. They also paid tribute to the representatives of socialist countries. They pointed out that socialist countries have not sent planes to bomb Cuban sugarcane fields, but only offer friendship, assistance, and mutually beneficial trade to Cuba.

The representatives attending the congress unanimously agreed with the report made by the General Secretary of the League, Calcines, on the first item on the agenda during the discussions.

The meeting is still in progress.

    这位美国代表说，美国和古巴的青年和人民之间的友谊已经在反对他们的共同敌人——美帝国主义垄断资本集团的斗争中建立起来。美国垄断资本集团过去武装巴蒂斯塔，现在轰炸古巴的甘蔗田，同时企图把美国人民拖入战争。他强调说，美国人民不希望战争。他说，现在正为反对种族歧视而斗争的美国黑人青年赞扬古巴革命政府所采取的反对种族歧视的措施和任命黑人担任政府和起义军高级职务的做法。他最后说：我们愿意在和平的世界上发展古巴和美国的友谊。
    加拿大、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国、法国、多米尼加和尼加拉瓜的代表向代表大会转达了他们国家的青年和人民对古巴革命的支持，并且谴责美帝国主义反对古巴革命的罪恶阴谋。
    古巴7月26日运动和起义青年联合会的代表相继在大会上发言，表示坚决主张不断加强古巴青年和全体人民的革命力量之间的团结，以保卫国家主权。他们向拉丁美洲国家的代表致敬，拉丁美洲各国人民正在登记为反对帝国主义侵略而斗争的志愿者。他们也向社会主义国家的代表致敬。他们指出，社会主义国家没有派飞机轰炸古巴的甘蔗田，而只有对古巴的友谊、援助和互利的贸易。
    出席代表大会的代表们在讨论中一致同意联盟总书记卡尔西内斯就会议第一项议程所作的报告。
    会议还在继续进行中。
