On the Writing of Factory History

Factory History – A Product of the Great Leap Forward

The writing of factory history is a product of the cultural construction upsurge that accompanied the high tide of economic construction in our country in 1958. It is an important aspect of the vigorous mass creative movement that has unfolded in factories and mines since the Great Leap Forward. Combined with the current activities in rural areas of compiling commune histories and veteran cadres writing revolutionary memoirs, it has become a torrent in the magnificent cultural revolution movement in our country. Currently, many places across the country are compiling factory histories, mine histories, or construction site histories (generally referred to as factory histories), with tens of thousands of factory and mine workers participating in this writing. The factory histories they write also differ from general historical works. The vast majority select representative events and figures from their own factories, mines, and construction sites, and write them as features and memoirs to reflect the labor, production, life, and struggle of workers in various historical periods. Factory history has both scientific historical value and is also a literary work. Since the spring of 1958, when the writing of factory history began in our country's factories and mines, almost all literary journals and literary supplements of newspapers across the country have successively selected and published factory history works, making them a popular read among the people.

Compiling factory history is, in effect, writing the history of the growth and development of the working class, the history of labor, life, and struggle, the history of socialist construction and the proletarian revolution. This history has a profound educational significance for the working class and the people of the whole country. Now, the working class in our country has been completely liberated from its previous enslaved status and has become the master of the country. However, some young workers and new members of the working class are not so clear about the suffering and glory of the working class's history. Therefore, it is essential to use the history of the working class and the history of the factory to educate themselves. In the spring of 1958, when the rectification campaign entered the stage of ideological construction, many veteran workers used their own experiences and the history of the working class to educate young workers and conduct self-education. At this time, the Chinese Writers Association promptly proposed the writing of factory history, which was warmly welcomed by the Party committees of factories and mines and the broad masses of workers. In the past two years, the work of compiling factory history in our country has developed rapidly and extensively. Almost all industries within the industrial sector are represented. In the past two years, more than twenty factory histories have been formally published, including "Red Anyuan," "Cradle of Trains," "Spark of Steel City," and "Historical Tales of Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction" (note). Recently, the Writers Publishing House also published "The Red Star of the North," which is about the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory. The activity of compiling factory history can play a positive role in raising the communist consciousness of the working class in our country, carrying out class education for the broad masses of people, promoting the great development of production and construction in our country, enriching our socialist literature, and excavating historical materials of our workers' movement.

Most of these factory histories are written using artistic techniques and literary language. They all write about real people and real events in history. They are history, and at the same time, they are literary works. In addition, most of the chapters in each factory history are self-narrated and self-written by workers, with strong class feelings, clear love and hatred, and lively and clear language. Although some chapters are less artistic, they are cordial and moving to read, giving people great encouragement and education.

These factory history works are new forms and new blood in our country's literary treasure house. After their publication, they were loved by the broad masses of readers. Here, I would like to introduce to readers a few representative factory histories.

"Red Anyuan"

"Red Anyuan" is an outstanding mine history. It profoundly records the changes in Anyuan, Jiangxi – one of the earliest coal bases in our history – over the past sixty years. This change can generally illustrate the road that the working class in our country has traveled in the past sixty years. From the opening of the Anyuan Coal Mine in 1898, the workers here were subjected to the most cruel oppression and exploitation under the collusion of the three major enemies of the Chinese people – imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic compradorism – and lived the poorest and most bitter lives. They had constantly resisted and struggled. As early as 1905, the Anyuan workers had carried out a strike. In 1906, more than 6,000 miners participated in the Ping-Liu-Li Uprising. These spontaneous struggles gave the reactionaries a certain blow, but because of the lack of leadership from the working class's own vanguard – the Communist Party – they could not jump out of the sea of suffering as a result. On the contrary, they later suffered even more severe oppression. In 1921, when the Communist Party of China was established, the lives of the Anyuan workers underwent fundamental changes. Under the leadership of the Party, the Anyuan workers held the nationally renowned Anyuan Great Strike in 1922, forcing the feudal bureaucrats to recognize the thirteen demands put forward by the workers and achieving a great victory. Because this strike tempered and educated the masses of workers, and with the strong leadership of the Party, when the "February 7th" Massacre occurred in 1923 and the national workers' movement turned into a low tide, the Anyuan Trade Union still stood tall, like a bright light in the dark night, guiding the working class to continue fighting. Anyuan became a sacred place for the workers' movement. From then on, the Anyuan workers carried out unyielding struggles under the leadership of the Party. However, it is also very clear from "Red Anyuan": before the working class seized power, their situation of being oppressed and exploited was not fundamentally changed. Only after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and the working class established its own power under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, did the Anyuan coal miners end their tragic lives and become the masters of the country. Since then, they have developed production with great labor enthusiasm. In 1958, the production efficiency of coal miners in the entire mine increased more than eight times compared to 1949.

In addition to recording the suffering of the Anyuan workers in the old society, the struggles they carried out, and their inspiring deeds of carrying out socialist construction with high spirits and high morale after liberation, the most prominent feature of "Red Anyuan" is the detailed, vivid, and profound description of the course and influence of the Anyuan Great Strike of 1922. In "Red Anyuan," there are a total of sixty-two memoirs recording the Anyuan Great Strike and its impact. From these memoirs, it can be clearly seen that the Communists armed with Marxism-Leninism are like a flame. Wherever they go, the flames of revolution burn there. We see that under the Party's enlightenment and education, the workers gradually awakened and united. In September 1922, they held the Anyuan Great Strike with the participation of more than 10,000 workers, igniting a raging revolutionary fire in Anyuan. The reactionary rulers were terrified in front of this revolutionary fire, so in the autumn of 1925, they used the most frantic massacre to extinguish this fire. The result was counterproductive. Not only was the revolutionary fire not extinguished, but thousands of Anyuan workers who had undergone revolutionary training participated in the Northern Expedition and the Autumn Harvest Uprising. They ignited the raging revolutionary fire in a wider area.

The Anyuan workers' movement revealed in the book also fully demonstrated the leading role of the Party and the vanguard role of the Communists. Wherever they were, the Communists stood at the forefront of the revolutionary struggle, leading the revolution forward. And when these Communists were gloriously sacrificed, they showed their infinite loyalty and brave spirit to the revolutionary cause. For example, in the cold winter, Comrade Chen Gongpei was stripped naked by the enemy and hung on a parasol tree, beaten until his skin was torn and his flesh was rotten, but his fighting spirit became stronger and stronger: "Beat me! Kill me! No matter how ruthless you are, you cannot shake my revolutionary heart. I, Chen Gongpei, am made of steel and iron, and can never be destroyed." It was precisely because of the Communists' spirit of unwavering and courageous revolution that the revolutionary cause continued to develop, moving from victory to victory.

"The Red Star of the North"

"The Red Star of the North" is a historical literary work with revolutionary historical value and a high artistic level. It is the largest in the factory histories that have been published, with a total of forty-five stories, essays, and features, totaling 360,000 words. It vividly records the development of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, one of the sites where the famous "February 7th" Great Strike in the history of the Chinese workers' movement took place. Through many typical examples and typical figures, the book meticulously describes the economic aggression of our country by British, French and other imperialists, the reactionary rule of warlords and the Kuomintang, the Japanese imperialist occupation of our territory, the harm to our country's workers, and the workers' struggle from spontaneity to consciousness. In particular, the book reflects the situation of the factory workers’ vigorous "February 7th" Great Strike in 1923 in a very specific and profound way, not only writing about the detailed process of "February 7th," but also prominently reflecting the most resolute and thorough revolutionary nature and dauntless spirit shown by the working class under the leadership of the Party in this strike. The book also contains records of Comrade Deng Zhongxia's leadership of the workers' movement, as well as biographies of the "February 7th" worker leader Shi Wenbin and the "February 7th" martyr Ge Shugui, recording the fighting lives of these outstanding sons of the working class. These works are touching and will undoubtedly become good teaching materials for us to carry out revolutionary tradition education today.

This factory history also provides a strong reflection of the leapfrog development of the factory in the short ten years after liberation. Through twelve articles, we see that this locomotive repair factory, which in the past could only carry out repairs, has manufactured new types of steam locomotives and internal combustion locomotives after liberation, bringing the factory into a new historical stage. In these articles, the working class's strong sense of ownership and creative labor spirit leap off the page.

"The Red Star of the North" also has distinctive features in its writing method. The entire book is divided into four parts according to the historical development of the factory, with clear outlines and distinct stages. Before each part, there is also an excellent overview, which, like a long line, connects the individual works in each part; and like a complete map, it depicts the entire factory in each historical period, giving people a general understanding. The four overviews in the book form a complete and clear microcosm of the factory history.

"Cradle of Trains"

"Cradle of Trains" is also an excellent factory history. From the seventeen feature articles, one can roughly see the main situation of the Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory in various historical periods over the past thirty years.

This factory history is all about struggle stories. There are struggles against Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries; after liberation, there are struggles of workers under the leadership of the Party to conquer difficulties and advance towards cutting-edge science. Each work expresses the heroic spirit of the working-class fighters in their close unity, unwavering loyalty, and heroic spirit in the struggle against the enemy, and the communist spirit of selfless labor in socialist construction. Even in the most difficult times before liberation, the workers were always full of fighting spirit and optimism. This fully demonstrates the spirit of the working class in our country.

Although this factory has more than thirty years of history, because of the different environments in which it was located in history, it did not experience such major political struggles as the Anyuan Coal Mine before liberation, and the changes were not very great. After liberation, however, the workers made great progress in labor, production, life, and thought, and new people and new things were everywhere. Therefore, this factory history focuses on the period after liberation, focusing on recording the happy lives of the workers after liberation and the enthusiasm and creativity they showed in labor and production. And it can be seen from this that the workers' labor consciousness and enthusiasm can only be fully developed under today's socialist system. The article dictated by worker Bu Yuqin uses her own personal experience to illustrate this point. Before liberation, her husband worked hard in this factory for more than ten years, without filling his stomach. Her eldest daughter and third son starved to death. After liberation, her husband was happy and actively participated in the railway and bridge repair projects to support the War of Liberation. Unfortunately, he was injured and died in a rescue. Based on her life experience in the old society, Bu Yuqin thought that days worse than a nightmare were waiting for her. But the factory sent her five million yuan (equivalent to five hundred yuan in the new currency) in compensation, and also hired her to work in the factory, and helped her learn to read. This family woman, who was illiterate in the past, can now read newspapers, take notes, and was elected as a trade union member of the whole factory. Recently, she was promoted to cadre. Her two children are in school. The daughter is a member of the Communist Youth League, and the son is a member of the Young Pioneers. She has joined the Party. During the Spring Festival in 1959, in order to express her feelings, she posted a couplet on the door: "Mother, daughter, and son, two generations of happiness rely on the Communist Party; Party, League, and Team, the whole family is glorious, thanks to Chairman Mao." The horizontal scroll is "Happy Family." This kind of happy family reflects the social life of today. Bu Yuqin's happy family is a microcosm of the living conditions of the workers in our country.

Record the High Tide of the Great Leap Forward in History

The factory history of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, "Spark of Steel City," has roughly the same characteristics as "Cradle of Trains" in terms of content and editing method. But there are also differences, that is, it more prominently records the workers' heroic spirit of rushing to the sky during the Great Leap Forward. Among the twenty-seven articles in the book, seven are features on the Great Leap Forward. From these features, we can see how the workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company pioneered "three-slag tapping"; how the youth blast furnace won the national championship five times and created national records ten times, and the utilization coefficient exceeded that of advanced countries in the world.

"Historical Tales of Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction" is another type of factory history. What it presents to the reader is a thrilling construction picture after liberation. It tells the reader how a newly emerging giant steel base – Wuhan Iron and Steel Company – was built at the fastest speed under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. From the groundbreaking ceremony in July 1955, it took only more than four years to put into production two fully automated blast furnaces, four coke ovens, three open-hearth furnaces, and other equipment.

Wuhan Iron and Steel Company is a modern, large-scale, mechanized, and automated iron and steel joint enterprise built by the people of our country under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. In these four years, from nothing to something, from small to large, a giant steel base was built on the flat ground. How rich is the content in this construction process! A feature collection like "Historical Tales of Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction" cannot record all the rich experiences, moving deeds, and commendable heroic figures in the construction. However, in this collection, it also reflects how the employees who built Wuhan Iron and Steel, in order to change the "poor and blank" face of our country and build our country into a socialist power with modern industry, how they boosted their energy, strived for the top, and built the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise quickly, well, and economically, fully demonstrating the greatness and correctness of the Party's general line of socialist construction.

This is the first time that the people of our country have built such a large and advanced enterprise with their own hands. But what we see from this "Historical Tale" is, as many employees said: "Learn if you don't understand, and drill if you can't." "Thousands of difficulties and hardships cannot defeat the working class." "Nothing can compare with the determination of our working class." "Our Communist Party members are not afraid of difficulties in doing things. The more difficult it is, the more we must create miracles." It is with this determination and drive that countless difficulties have been overcome one by one, making Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction leap forward again and again.

"Historical Tales of Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction" not only demonstrates the daring, daring, and communist style of the working class in our country inspired by Mao Zedong Thought, as well as their daring to despise difficulties, their ability to overcome difficulties, their daring to continuously revolutionize, and their ability to continuously leap forward, but also fully demonstrates the great spirit of unity, mutual support, and concerted cooperation among the people of the whole country and socialist countries under the socialist system.

The sixty-three feature articles selected in this factory history have high quality. They meticulously describe the soaring enthusiasm, heroic spirit, spirit of unity and friendship, and the belief in victory of the employees in the construction, which makes people feel deeply and unforgettable for a long time.

In the beginning, some people thought that there was no history to write about in the newly built factories and mines after liberation; some old factories also neglected this part after liberation when compiling factory history. This is a misunderstanding. They do not understand that the factory history in the period after liberation is the history of the working class in our country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, working together with the people of the whole country to build our socialist industry. It is an important part of our socialist construction and socialist revolution, and the content is very rich. It can and must be written in a big way. "Historical Tales of Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction" is an example. There are newly built and expanded factories and mines everywhere in our country after liberation. If we can write the construction history and struggle history of these factories and mines, we can show the magnificent picture of socialist construction in our country.

The Great Significance of Compiling Factory History

The reason I introduced several artistic factory histories here is not to say that only this writing method is advocated. The writing of factory history should also be diversified. According to the situation of one's own factory and mine and the needs of all aspects, one can write this artistic factory history, or one can write some scientific works that belong to summarizing the experience of economic construction and the experience of the workers' movement. In fact, the factory histories written in various places are also diverse in form. Some factories and mines have also written many performance materials based on the vivid stories in the factory history and performed them in their own factories and mines, and there have been many purely artistic creations of poetry, novels, operas, dramas, and film scripts. This is a very good phenomenon. The factory history writing movement will surely see a beautiful scene of blooming flowers.

The compilation of factory history in various places is carried out under the direct leadership of the Party committees of factories and mines. Some factories and mines are headed by the Party committee secretary, who personally leads this work.

Why do the Party committees of factories and mines in various places attach so much importance to the compilation of factory history? Because it is the most vivid and practical teaching material for carrying out class education, labor education, revolutionary tradition education, and socialist and communist education for employees. In the spring of 1958, when some factories in Tianjin began to compile factory history, it showed its educational role. For example, Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory No. 5, after carrying out revolutionary tradition education for employees through factory history, enhanced the sense of responsibility of the working class and promoted the style of hard work and simplicity. A brand-new atmosphere appeared among the workers: fewer people were comparing eating, wearing, and enjoying, and what replaced them was comparing politics, comparing drilling, and comparing drive. The history of the working class's revolutionary struggle educated them, encouraged them, and spurred them on, making them invigorated and full of fighting spirit, and brought out amazing labor enthusiasm in production. Later, the compilation of factory history in various places referred to Tianjin's experience, closely combined the compilation of factory history with communist ideological education, complemented each other, and promoted production.

The reason why factory history can achieve such a great educational effect is also inseparable from its writing method of carrying out mass movements and adhering to the mass line in the compilation. From the beginning of writing factory history in Tianjin, a good tradition was established – mobilizing the broad masses of employees (especially veteran workers) to self-narrate and self-write, and exhibiting the relevant materials (employee self-narrated and self-written materials, file materials, pictures and real objects, etc.) at the factory history exhibition, and meeting with the broad masses of employees. After the exhibition, the writing of factory history was further promoted. In this way, the process of compiling factory history became a process of self-education for all employees in the factory. In recalling the past, the workers compared their current political status, production conditions, and welfare with those before liberation. They felt that they were really living in heaven now, and they should support the socialist system, cherish the status of the working class, and love the leadership of the Party; they should work and produce more vigorously, build our motherland more prosperous and powerful, and pursue higher ideals.

At the same time, the experience of various places has also proved that in order to compile an excellent factory history with strong ideological content and make it loved by people, it is not enough to just mobilize employees to self-narrate and self-write. Mobilizing the masses to say what they can say and write what they can write is only the first important step. It is also necessary to adopt the policy of "walking on two legs" on this basis. The so-called "walking on two legs" means that we must not only extensively mobilize the masses to self-narrate and self-write, but also have overall planning and arrangements from the leadership; we must not only have extensive mass writing as the foundation, but also have the guidance of specialized personnel (such as writers, newspaper and magazine editors, university teachers and students, and specially assigned personnel from the factory). Because the broad masses of employees are the creators and participants of history, only by fully mobilizing them can the historical situation be reflected more completely. But as far as each employee is concerned, he does not have as comprehensive a grasp as the leadership, and he can weigh the status of an event in history or in the entire factory. Therefore, on the basis of extensively mobilizing the masses to self-narrate and self-write, the leadership formulates a selection plan for the factory history based on the representative events and figures in history and in the whole factory, and then organizes the relevant employees to conduct in-depth and specific recollections and writing; and then improves on this writing basis, and it is possible to write a relatively excellent factory history. The reason why factory histories such as "Historical Tales of Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction" and "Red Anyuan" are of high quality is that they have a great relationship with the adoption of these two "combinations."

Over the past year or so, many writers, newspaper and magazine editors, and university teachers and students in various places have given great support and help to the work of compiling factory history in factories and mines. The ability to write some good factory histories now is inseparable from their hard work. And the participation of writers, editors, and university teachers and students in the guidance work of factory history writing is also a way of combining with the working people and with reality. They can be educated and tempered from it; writers can also draw nourishment from it and lay a good foundation for creation.

The working people have always been the creators of material wealth and culture and art, but for thousands of years, the exploiting classes have not only seized the creations of the working people as their own, but also erased the exploits of the working people from history; they have written history into the genealogies of feudal dynasties and the bourgeoisie. The creations of workers and peasants are rarely or根本不可能得到正确的反映. Only after liberation, under the leadership of the Party, can the working class have this possibility to describe themselves. Compiling factory history, writing the revolutionary struggles of the working class and the labor creations of many ordinary workers into the annals of history, and restoring the true face of history is an important task. It is a mass writing movement and also an ideological education movement.

    评工厂史的写作
    郑兴万
    工厂史——大跃进的产物
    工厂史的写作，是1958年随着我国经济建设高潮而来的文化建设高潮的一个产物。它是大跃进以来厂矿中蓬蓬勃勃开展起来的群众创作运动的一个重要方面；它和目前正在农村中展开的编写公社史和老干部们写革命回忆录的活动结合起来，成为我国当前波澜壮阔的文化革命运动的一股激流。现在全国许多地方都在编写厂史、矿史或工地史（人们总称之为工厂史），有成千成万的厂矿职工参加这项写作。他们所写的工厂史也不同于一般的历史著作，绝大多数都是选择自己厂、矿、工地中具有代表性的事件和人物，把它们写成特写和回忆录，来反映各个历史时期工人劳动、生产、生活和斗争的面貌。工厂史既具有科学的史料价值，同时又是文学作品。从1958年春天，在我国厂矿中开始编写工厂史以来，几乎全国所有的文艺刊物和报纸的文艺副刊都陆续选载了工厂史作品，成为全国人民所喜爱的一种读物。
    编写工厂史，实际上就是写工人阶级成长、壮大的历史，劳动、生活和斗争的历史，社会主义建设和无产阶级革命的历史。这个历史对工人阶级及全国人民都有极深刻的教育意义。现在我国工人阶级已经从以往的奴隶地位彻底解放出来，成为国家的主人。但是有些青年工人和工人阶级中的新成份，对于工人阶级历史的苦难和光荣，还不是那么清楚。因此，用工人阶级的历史，用本厂的历史去教育自己，就成为十分必要的了。1958年春天，整风进入思想建设阶段时，许多老工人又用自己的亲身经历和工人阶级的历史来教育青年工人，并进行自我教育。在这个时候，中国作家协会及时地提出编写工厂史的倡议，便得到了各地厂矿党委和广大职工的热烈响应。近两年来，我国编写工厂史的工作发展迅速，地区也广泛。几乎工业部门中的各行各业，应有尽有。近两年来，已经正式出版的工厂史，有《红色的安源》、《列车的摇篮》、《钢城星火》、《武钢建设史话》（注）等二十几部了。最近作家出版社又出版了一本写长辛店机车车辆厂的《北方的红星》。编写工厂史的活动，对于提高我国工人阶级的共产主义觉悟，对广大人民进行阶级教育，促进我国生产建设的大发展，繁荣我国社会主义文学，发掘我国工人运动史料，都能起到积极的作用。
    这些工厂史多数都是采用文艺手法，运用文学语言写成的。它们所写的都是历史上的真人真事，是历史，同时又是文学作品。加以每部工厂史中大多数篇章都是工人自述、自写的，阶级感情浓烈，爱憎分明，语言生动明快，虽然有些篇章艺术性还差一些，但读起来亲切动人，给人以极大的鼓舞和教育。
    这些工厂史著作，是我国文学宝库中的新形式、新血液。它们出版以后，受到广大读者的喜爱。这里我只向读者介绍几本有代表性的工厂史。
      《红色的安源》
    《红色的安源》是一部出色的矿史。它深刻地记述了江西安源——我国历史上最早的煤炭基地之一，六十多年来的变迁。这个变迁可以概括地说明我国工人阶级近六十年来所走过的道路。从1898年安源煤矿一开办，这里的工人就在中国人民的三大敌人——帝国主义、封建主义和官僚买办的相互勾结下，受到最残酷的压迫和剥削，过着最穷最苦的生活。他们曾经不断反抗和斗争。早在1905年安源工人就进行过一次罢工。1906年又有矿工六千多人参加萍、浏、醴起义。这些自发的斗争给了反动派一定的打击，然而由于缺乏工人阶级自己的先锋队——共产党的领导，并不能因此而使工人跳出苦海，相反，后来遭到了更为严重的压迫。到了1921年，中国共产党一成立，安源工人的生活就起了根本的变化。在党的领导下，安源工人在1922年举行了全国闻名的安源大罢工，迫使封建官僚承认工人提出的十三项要求，取得很大的胜利。由于这次罢工锻炼并教育了工人群众，又有坚强的党的领导，因此，当1923年“二七”惨案发生以后，全国工人运动转入低潮时，安源工会仍然巍然屹立，像黑夜里的一盏明灯，指引着工人阶级继续战斗。安源成了工人运动的圣地。从此，安源工人就在党的领导下进行了不屈不挠的斗争。但是，从《红色的安源》中也看得很清楚：在工人阶级没有取得政权以前，并没有从根本上改变他们受压迫、受剥削的处境。只有到1949年中华人民共和国成立，工人阶级在中国共产党和毛主席领导下建立自己的政权以后，安源煤矿工人才结束了他们悲惨的生活，成为国家的主人。从此以后，他们以极大的劳动热情发展生产，1958年全矿采煤工的生产效率比1949年提高了八倍多。
    《红色的安源》除了记述安源工人在旧社会所受的苦难、所进行的斗争以及他们在解放后意气风发、斗志昂扬地进行社会主义建设的动人事迹以外，最突出的特点，就在于对1922年安源大罢工的经过及其影响作了详细、生动而又深刻的描述。在《红色的安源》中，记述安源大罢工及其影响的回忆录共有六十二篇。从这些回忆录中可以清楚地看到：以马克思列宁主义思想所武装起来的共产党员，就像一团烈火，到哪里，革命的火焰就燃烧到那里。我们看到：工人们在党的启发教育下逐步觉醒起来、团结起来，在1922年9月举行了一万多工人参加的安源大罢工，在安源燃起了熊熊的革命烈火。反动统治者在这团革命烈火面前惊恐万状，于是在1925年秋天，用最疯狂的屠杀来扑灭这团烈火，结果适得其反，革命烈火不但没有被扑灭，而且成千上万经受过革命锻炼的安源工人，参加了北伐战争和秋收起义。他们又在更广阔的地区燃起了熊熊的革命烈火。
    在书中所揭示的安源工人运动中，也充分显示了党的领导作用和共产党员的先锋作用。无论在哪里，共产党员都是站在革命斗争最前线，领导革命前进的。而这些共产党员在壮烈牺牲的时候，都表现了对革命事业无限忠贞勇敢的精神。比如在严寒的冬天，陈功佩同志被敌人剥光了衣服，吊在梧桐树上，打得皮开肉烂，可是他的斗志越来越坚强：“打吧！杀吧！你们再狠也动摇不了我革命的心，我陈功佩是钢筋铁骨，永远摧毁不了的。”正是由于共产党员这种坚贞不屈，勇往直前的革命精神，才使革命事业不断发展，从胜利走向胜利。
      《北方的红星》
    “北方的红星”是一部富有革命史料价值又有较高艺术水平的历史文学作品。在已出的厂史中，篇幅最大，共有四十五篇故事、散文和特写，三十六万字。它生动地记载了中国工人运动史上有名的“二七”大罢工发生地之一——长辛店机车车辆厂的发展面貌。书中通过许多典型事例和典型人物，把英法等帝国主义对我国的经济侵略、军阀和国民党的反动统治、日本帝国主义侵占我国领土后，对我国工人的残害，以及工人阶级从自发到自觉的斗争等作了细致的描写。特别是对1923年该厂工人举行轰轰烈烈的“二七”大罢工的情况，反映得十分具体、深刻，不仅写出了“二七”的详细经过，而且突出地反映了党领导下的工人阶级在这次罢工中所显示的最坚决、最彻底的革命性与大无畏精神。书中还有邓中夏同志领导工人运动的记实，以及“二七”工人领袖史文彬、“二七”烈士葛树贵等的传记，记载了这些工人阶级的优秀儿子的战斗的一生。这些作品感人肺腑，无疑地将成为今天我们进行革命传统教育的良好教材。
    这部厂史，对解放后该厂在短短十年中的飞跃发展，也作了有力的反映。通过十二篇文章，使我们看到这个过去只能修修补补的机车修理厂在解放后竟制造出了新型的蒸汽机车和内燃机车，使工厂进入了一个新的历史阶段。在这些文章中，工人阶级的强烈的主人翁感和创造性的劳动精神跃然纸上。
      “北方的红星”在编写方法上也有鲜明的特色。全书按该厂历史发展分四大部分，眉目清楚，阶段分明。在每一部分前，又各有一篇精彩的概述，它像一条长线一样，把每一部分的单篇作品串连起来；又像一幅全图一样，把每一历史时期的工厂全貌描绘出来，给人一个概括的认识。全书四篇概述组成了这部厂史的完整而清晰的缩影。
      《列车的摇篮》
    《列车的摇篮》也是一本优秀的工厂史。从十七篇特写里，大致可以看出沈阳机车车辆工厂三十多年来各个不同历史时期的主要情况。
    这部厂史全部是斗争故事。里面有对日本帝国主义、国民党反动派的斗争；有解放后，工人们在党的领导下征服困难、向尖端科学进军的斗争。每篇作品都表现了英雄的工人阶级战士在对敌斗争中紧密团结、忠贞不屈的英雄气概，和社会主义建设中忘我劳动的共产主义精神。即使在解放前最困难的时期，工人们也总是斗志昂扬，充满乐观主义精神。这充分表现我国工人阶级的气概。
    这个工厂虽然有三十多年历史，但由于它在历史上所处的环境不同，在解放前没有经历过像安源煤矿那样重大的政治斗争，变化并不太大。而解放后，工人们在劳动、生产、生活和思想上却获得巨大的进步，新人新事到处都是。因此，这本厂史把它的重点放在解放以后，着重记述了工人们在解放后所过的幸福生活和他们在劳动生产上表现出来的积极性和创造性。并且从中可以看到，工人这种劳动自觉性和积极性只是在今天这样的社会主义制度下才充分发挥出来。工人卜玉琴口述的文章，用自己的亲身经历说明了这个道理。解放前，她丈夫在这个厂里苦苦劳动了十来年，没有装饱过肚子，她的大女儿和第三个儿子就是活活饿死了的。解放了，她的丈夫乐得脸上开了花，为了支援解放战争，积极参加了铁路、桥梁的修复工程。不幸，在一次抢修中负伤牺牲了。卜玉琴凭着在旧社会的生活经验，以为这下比恶梦还可怕的日子在等待着她了。可是工厂给她送来了五百万元（合新币五百元）抚恤金，又吸收她进厂作工，又帮她学文化。这个过去是文盲的家庭妇女，现在能读报、记笔记，被选为全厂的工会委员。最近又提拔她当了干部。她两个孩子都在学校念书。女儿是团员，儿子是队员，自己入了党。1959年春节时，为了表达她的心情，她在门上贴了一幅对联：“母、女、子两代幸福依靠共产党，党、团、队全家光荣感谢毛主席”。横批是“幸福之家”。这种幸福之家，反映了我们今天的社会生活面貌。卜玉琴的幸福之家，是我国工人生活情况的一个缩影。
    把跃进高潮载入史册
    太原钢铁公司厂史《钢城星火》，在内容和编辑方法上具有与《列车的摇篮》大体相同的特点。但也有不同之处，那就是更加突出地记述了工人在大跃进中干劲冲天的英雄气概。全书二十七篇文章中，有七篇是关于大跃进的特写。从这些特写中可以看到，太原钢铁公司的工人如何首创“三槽出钢”；青年高炉如何五夺全国冠军、十创全国纪录，利用系数超过了世界上先进的国家。
    《武钢建设史话》则是另外一种类型的工厂史，它展现在读者面前的，却是一幅解放后惊心动魄的建设图景。它告诉读者，一个新兴的巨型的钢铁基地——武汉钢铁公司，怎样在党和毛主席的英明领导下，以最快的速度建设起来了。从1955年7月破土开工，仅仅花了四年多时间，就有全部自动化的两座高炉、四座焦炉、三座平炉及其他设备投入生产。
    武汉钢铁公司，是我国人民在党和毛主席领导下亲手建立起来的近代化的、大规模的、机械化、自动化的钢铁联合企业。在这四年多时间，从无到有，从小到大，在平地上建立起了巨型的钢铁基地。在这个建设过程中，有多么丰富的内容啊！像《武钢建设史话》这样一本特写集子，不可能把建设中丰富的经验、动人的事迹和可歌可颂的英雄人物全部记载下来。但是，就在这本集子里，也反映出了建设武钢的职工们，为了改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，把我国建设成为具有现代工业的社会主义强国，他们如何鼓足干劲，力争上游，把武汉钢铁联合企业建设得又快又好又省，充分显示出了党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大和正确。
    我国人民自己亲手建设这样庞大、先进的企业，这还是第一次。但是我们从这“史话”中看到的，正像许多职工所说：“不懂就学，不会就钻。”“千难万难，难不倒工人阶级。”“什么也比不上我们工人阶级的决心大。”“我们共产党员作事就是不怕困难，愈困难就愈要创造奇迹。”就是凭着这种决心和干劲，无数的困难一个一个地被克服掉了，使武钢建设一再跃进。
    在《武钢建设史话》中，不光是表现了我国工人阶级在毛主席思想感召下迸发出来的敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，以及他们敢于藐视困难，能够战胜困难，敢于不断革命，能够持续跃进的战斗精神，同时还充分表现了在社会主义制度下，全国人民及社会主义国家之间团结一致、互相支援、通力协作的伟大精神。
    这本厂史选辑的六十三篇特写，质量较高，对职工们在建设中的冲天干劲、豪迈的气魄、团结友爱的精神和必胜的信心，作了细致的描写，使人感受很深，经久难忘。
    开初，有人认为解放后新建的厂矿无史可写；有些老厂在编写厂史时也忽略了解放后这一部分。这是一种误解。他们不理解，解放后这段时期的工厂史，是我国工人阶级在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，与全国人民一道，同心协力建设我们社会主义工业的历史，是我国社会主义建设和社会主义革命的重要部分，内容十分丰富，可以也必须大写特写。《武钢建设史话》就是例证。我国解放后新建和扩建的厂矿到处都有。如能把这些厂矿的建设史、奋斗史都写出来，就能展示出我国社会主义建设的壮丽图景。
    编写工厂史的重大意义
    我在这里介绍了几本文艺性的工厂史，并不是说只提倡这种写法。写工厂史也要百花齐放，根据自己厂矿的情况和各方面的需要，可以写这种文艺性的工厂史，也可以写些属于总结经济建设经验和工人运动经验的科学性的著作。实际上现在各地所写的工厂史在形式上也是多种多样的。有些厂矿还根据工厂史中生动的故事，写了不少演唱材料在自己厂、矿演出，出现了许多纯粹属于文艺创作的诗歌、小说、歌剧、话剧及电影剧本。这是非常好的现象。工厂史写作运动，一定会出现百花盛开的美景。
    各地编写工厂史都是由厂矿党委亲自领导进行的。有些厂矿并由党委书记挂帅，亲自领导这项工作。
    为什么各地厂矿党委这样重视工厂史的编写工作呢？因为它是向职工进行阶级教育、劳动教育、革命传统教育和社会主义、共产主义教育的最生动、最实际的教材。1958年春天，天津一些工厂开始编写厂史的时候，就显示了它的教育作用。如天津棉纺五厂，通过厂史向职工进行革命传统教育以后，增强了工人阶级责任感，发扬了艰苦朴素的作风，在工人中出现了崭新的气象：比吃比穿比享受的人少了，代之而起的是比政治、比钻劲、比干劲。工人阶级革命斗争的历史，教育着他们，鼓舞着他们，鞭策着他们，使他们精神振奋，斗志昂扬，在生产上发挥出惊人的劳动热情。后来，各地编写工厂史参照天津的经验，把编写工厂史与共产主义思想教育工作紧密结合起来，相辅相成，推动了生产。
    工厂史能够达到这样大的教育效果，又是与它在编写中大搞群众运动，坚持群众路线的编写方法分不开的。从天津一开始写工厂史就建立了一个良好的传统——发动广大职工
  （特别是老工人）自述、自写，并将有关材料（职工自述自写的材料、档案材料和图片实物等）在工厂史展览会上展出，和广大职工群众见面。经过展览，又进一步推动了工厂史的写作。这样，工厂史的编写过程，就成了全厂职工自我教育的过程。工人们在回忆往事中，拿现在的政治地位、生产条件、生活福利和解放以前比较，感到现在真是生活在天堂里了，应该拥护社会主义制度，珍惜工人阶级地位，爱戴党的领导；应该更加奋发地劳动生产，把我们祖国建设得更加富强，奔赴更高的理想。
    同时，各地的经验也证明，要编写出一部思想性强，又使人爱读的优秀工厂史，光是发动职工自述、自写还是不够的。发动群众能说的说，能写的写，这只是首要的第一步，还需要在这个基础上采取“两条腿走路”的方针。所谓“两条腿走路”，就是既要广泛发动群众自述、自写，又要有领导上的全面规划和安排；既要有广泛的群众写作作为基础，又要有专门人员（如作家、报刊编辑、大学师生和厂里抽调的专人等）的辅导。因为广大职工群众是历史的创造者、参与者，只有充分发动他们，才能把历史情况比较完整地反映出来。但作为每个职工来讲，他又不像领导上那样掌握全面，能够权衡一件事物在历史上或整个厂矿中所处的地位。所以领导上在广泛发动群众自述自写的基础上，根据历史上和全厂中有代表性的事件和人物拟出工厂史的选题计划，再组织有关职工进行深入具体的回忆和写作；然后再在这个写作基础上加以提高，就可能写出比较优秀的工厂史来了。《武钢建设史话》和《红色的安源》等工厂史所以质量较高，就和他们采用这两个“结合”有很大关系。
    一年多来，各地许多作家、报刊编辑和大学师生对厂矿编写工厂史的工作，给了极大的支援和帮助，现在能够写出一些好的工厂史是和他们的辛勤劳动分不开的。而作家、编辑、大学师生参加工厂史写作的辅导工作，也是与劳动人民、与实际结合的一种途径。他们可以从中受到教育和锻炼；作家更可以从中吸取养分，为创作打好基础。
    劳动人民从来就是物质财富和文化艺术的创造者，但是几千年来，剥削阶级不仅把劳动人民的创造据为己有，而且把劳动人民的功勋从历史上一笔勾销；把历史写成封建王朝和资产阶级的家谱。工农群众的创造在现代资产阶级的史书上也很少或者根本不可能得到正确的反映。只有在解放以后，在党的领导下，工人阶级才能够有这可能来描写他们自己。编写工厂史，把工人阶级的革命斗争和许许多多普通工人的劳动创造写上史册，还历史以本来面目，这是一项重要的工作。它是一个群众写作运动，也是一个思想教育运动。
