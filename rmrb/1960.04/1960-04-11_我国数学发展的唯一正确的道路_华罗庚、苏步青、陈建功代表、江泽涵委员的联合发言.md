The Only Correct Path for the Development of Mathematics in Our Country
Joint Speech by Delegates Hua Luogeng, Su Buqing, Chen Jiangong, and Committee Member Jiang Zehan

Chairman, fellow delegates:

We fully agree with the reports of the three Vice Premiers, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin.

Here, we would like to report to the conference on the recent situation of the mathematics community in our country, especially the Second National Congress of the Chinese Mathematical Society recently held in Shanghai.

Ancient Chinese mathematics had a glorious history. Later, due to long-term feudal rule, mathematics lagged behind. In the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society of the last hundred years, the modern mathematics transplanted from Western capitalist countries could not take root in the motherland and could not be combined with the actual situation of the motherland. Therefore, before liberation, in general, the development of mathematics was slow, the direction was unclear, and the strength was weak. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the correct leadership of the Party, mathematicians across the country have done a lot of work and cultivated a large number of mathematical talents, which should be affirmed. Especially in 1958, after the rectification movement and the implementation of the Party's education policy, under the leadership of the Party, the national mathematics community criticized the bourgeois academic thought that was divorced from reality; under the guidance of the principle of combining theory with practice, a high tide of the movement of mathematical problems in production tasks was set off, forming a great leap forward in mathematical work. The achievements of this movement are huge, and the impact is far-reaching. Since then, mathematical research in our country has embarked on the broad road of serving socialist construction.

Now we have entered the great 1960s. The center of world science has shifted from capitalist countries to socialist countries. As Chinese mathematicians, we must also learn from the example of Soviet comrades, combine with the actual needs of our country in various aspects, vigorously carry out mathematical research, establish new theories, and quickly catch up with the international advanced level, so that we can independently solve all the important mathematical problems put forward by socialist construction in our country in a few years. Under the brilliant light of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, mathematicians across the country are jubilant and are making every effort to complete our tasks as soon as possible and in the best way.

In response to this objective situation, we held the Second National Congress of the Chinese Mathematical Society in Shanghai from February 24 to March 4. The conference discussed two special topics, namely the direction of mathematical research and the reform of mathematics courses.

	The purpose of studying numbers is to better understand and transform the world

Mathematics is a science that studies the relationship between spatial forms and quantities in the real world. Because the relationship between spatial forms and quantities is universally present in various phenomena in the real world, it is impossible to study these phenomena without mathematics, so the application of mathematics is very extensive. At the same time, because mathematics focuses on the relationship between spatial forms and quantities in the real world, it often temporarily sets aside other properties of things in the research process, so mathematics has a high degree of abstraction. This abstraction is to enable us to recognize the objective world more meticulously, deeply, and better. Therefore, the two characteristics of mathematics, high abstraction and wide application, are dialectically unified, and should not be viewed separately.

From the perspective of Marxists, the problem is not only to understand the world, but more importantly to transform the world. Therefore, studying mathematics itself is not the goal, but a means: as a component of a tool used to understand the world, master the laws in it, and then use these laws to transform the world and build a happy socialist and communist society. When we talk about the direction of mathematical development, we must pay attention to its purpose. Therefore, the Party's principle of combining theory with practice and serving proletarian politics with scientific work points out the only correct path for the current development of mathematics in our country.

Specifically, we must not only solve the mathematical problems directly raised in the practice of socialist production, but also develop mathematics in coordination with the development of various science and technologies, the purpose of which is still to serve socialist construction. At present, there are many mathematical problems raised in practical needs, and the first is that various engineering technologies, especially cutting-edge technologies and major projects, use profound mathematical knowledge and methods. Mathematics plays an increasingly important role in modern natural science research, especially in modern physics research on the microscopic world. Without modern mathematics, it is impossible to move forward. In recent years, mathematics has begun to play a direct role in the national economy, especially under the conditions of our country's socialist planned economy. It is promising to guide with Marxist-Leninist theory and use mathematical methods to solve some technical problems in the national economy. The practical problems raised in these areas often require calculating numerical answers. Therefore, mathematicians in our country also face a large number of calculation tasks. The development of modern computing technology has greatly increased the tasks in this area.

Combining economic development and adapting to production needs, mathematicians have proposed a mathematical development program

Based on the above, at the Congress of the Chinese Mathematical Society, everyone unanimously agreed that the following five aspects of the problem should be taken as the outline of mathematical development:

	1. Mathematical problems in cutting-edge technologies and major projects: such as problems in atomic energy technology, interstellar navigation, high-speed flight, radio and electronic technology, large-scale projects (water conservancy, construction, etc.), large-scale machine manufacturing, etc.
	2. Mathematical problems in automation: such as mathematical problems in electronic computers, logic machines, automatic control and remote control, electrical simulation, large-scale electronic systems, communication technology, advanced neural control, machine translation, etc.
	3. Mathematical problems in modern physics: This involves mathematical problems in atomic nucleus theory, elementary particle theory, solid-state electronics theory, etc.
	4. Mathematical problems in the national economy: such as mathematical problems in industrial rational layout, comprehensive utilization of reservoirs, transportation, material allocation, public utilities, industrial and agricultural production processes, etc.
	5. A large number of calculation tasks: mainly using modern computing technology equipment to engage in a large number of numerical calculations, and solving various practical mathematical problems raised in actual production.

Mathematics has many disciplines within it, but it itself is an organic whole. From the current practical needs, some disciplines have more and more direct connections and should be regarded as key developments; some disciplines have less or more indirect connections and should be regarded as general developments. In general, the above five aspects of needs are taken as the outline to drive the entire development of mathematics. The five aspects we have proposed as the outline not only make the purpose of improving mathematical theory and discipline development clearer, but also provide the best guarantee for improving theory and developing disciplines. Conversely, the improvement of theory and the development of disciplines will enable us to better complete the tasks and solve practical problems.

Speaking of developing mathematics, it not only involves the specialized research of mathematicians, but also because mathematics is a basic discipline, it is an important link in higher education in science and engineering, and it is also an important part of human general culture. With the rapid progress of technological innovation and technological revolution in our country, and with the rapid improvement of the cultural level of the vast number of people in our country, we must effectively improve the level of mathematics education in our country. From elementary school to university, how to teach students the most useful and newest mathematical knowledge in a fast and solid way, and cultivate their ability to think independently and flexibly apply the mathematical knowledge they have learned, is not only necessary for cultivating specialized scientific and technological talents, but also necessary for cultivating modern workers and farmers. The second topic of the Second National Congress of the Chinese Mathematical Society was the reform of mathematics courses. The conference specifically discussed the mathematics curriculum of primary and secondary schools. After inspecting the contents of past mathematics courses, we all unanimously believe that these contents are basically the mathematical knowledge acquired by mankind before the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which is old and backward, isolated and repetitive, fragmented and cumbersome, and divorced from reality. It is far from meeting the needs of the leap-forward development of socialist construction in our country. Therefore, we must fundamentally reform and break the old system that has not changed for hundreds of years since it was passed down from capitalist countries; according to the actual requirements of socialist construction in our country and the modern development of mathematics, we must re-formulate new teaching plans, teaching syllabuses and textbooks. At the conference, the Department of Mathematics of Beijing Normal University put forward a reform plan for mathematics teaching content. Everyone at the meeting agreed in principle with the revolutionary spirit of the Beijing Normal University's plan, and also unanimously requested that young laborers for socialist construction should be trained in accordance with the principles of short time limit and high quality, and also put forward many supplementary and corrective opinions. At present, various colleges and universities are also drawing up new plans. Under the leadership of the Party, the fundamental reform of mathematics courses at all levels has formed a mass movement, which will greatly improve the level of mathematics education in our country, thereby greatly facilitating the improvement of the level of science and technology.

In short, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, mathematics in our country has entered a new era in history, and making a revolution in mathematics has become a widely circulated slogan in the mathematics community across the country. Under the leadership of the Party, our mathematicians must quickly complete this great mission.

### 我国数学发展的唯一正确的道路  华罗庚、苏步青、陈建功代表、江泽涵委员的联合发言

    我国数学发展的唯一正确的道路
    华罗庚、苏步青、陈建功代表、江泽涵委员的联合发言主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意李富春、李先念和谭震林三位副总理的报告。
    我们在这里把我国数学界最近情况特别是最近在上海召开的中国数学会第二届全国代表大会的情况，向大会汇报一下。
    我国古代数学有过光辉的历史。后来由于长期的封建统治，数学落后了。近百年来，在半封建半殖民地的社会中，从西方资本主义国家移植来的一点近代数学不能在祖国生根，与祖国的实际根本不能结合。因此在解放前，总的说来，数学的发展是缓慢的，方向是不明确的，力量是薄弱的。中华人民共和国成立以来，全国数学工作者在党的正确领导下，做了很多工作，培养了大批数学人才，这是应该肯定的。特别在1958年，经过整风运动和贯彻党的教育方针之后，全国数学界在党的领导下，批判了脱离实际的资产阶级学术思想；在理论和实际相结合的方针指导下，掀起了大搞生产任务中的数学问题运动的高潮，形成了数学工作的大跃进。这一次运动的成绩是巨大的，影响是深远的。我国数学研究从此走上了为社会主义建设服务的康庄大道。
    现在我们已经进入伟大的六十年代。世界科学的中心已经从资本主义国家转移到社会主义国家。作为中国的数学工作者，我们也要学习苏联同志的榜样，结合我国各方面的实际需要，大力开展数学研究，建立新的理论，迅速赶上国际先进水平，使我们能在不长的几年内，独立地解决我国社会主义建设中所提出的一切重要数学问题。在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，全国数学工作者都在欢欣鼓舞，正在尽一切努力，争取尽快地、最好地完成我们的任务。
    针对这样的客观形势，我们在2月24日到3月4日，在上海召开了中国数学会第二次代表大会。会上讨论了两个专题，即数学研究的方向问题和数学课程改革问题。
        研究数字的目的，是为了更好地认识世界改造世界
    数学是研究现实世界中空间形式和量的关系的科学。由于空间形式和量的关系普遍存在于现实世界的各种现象中，研究这些现象就不可能脱离数学，因此数学的应用非常广泛。同时，由于数学着重研究现实世界中的空间形式和量的关系，在研究过程中，常暂时撇开事物的其它性质，所以数学具有高度的抽象性。这种抽象乃是为了使我们能够更细致、更深入、更好地认识客观世界。因此，数学的高度抽象性和应用的广泛性这两个特点，是辩证统一的，不应该把它们割裂开来看。
    从马克思主义者看来，问题不仅在于认识世界，而且更重要的在于改造世界。因此，研究数学本身不是目的，而是一种手段：作为用来认识世界，掌握其中规律，并进而利用这些规律来改造世界，建设幸福的社会主义共产主义社会的工具的一个组成部分。当我们谈到数学发展方向时，我们必须注意到它的目的性。因此，党的理论与实际相结合，科学工作为无产阶级政治服务的方针，为我国当前数学的发展指出唯一正确的道路。
    具体地说来，我们既要解决社会主义生产实际中直接提出来的数学问题，也要配合各种科学技术的发展来发展数学，目的仍是为社会主义建设服务。目前实际需要中提出的数学问题是很多的，而首先是各种工程技术，特别是尖端技术和重大工程都用到深刻的数学知识和方法。数学在现代自然科学研究中起着越来越重要的作用，尤其是现代物理学关于微观世界
  的研究，如果没有现代数学就不可能前进。近年来，数学在国民经济中开始起直接的作用，特别在我国社会主义计划经济的条件下，以马克思列宁主义理论来指导，运用数学方法来解决国民经济中一些带技术性的问题，乃是大有可为的。在这些方面提出的实际问题中，往往要求计算出数值的答案来，
  因此我国数学工作者也面临大量的计算任务。现代计算技术的发展更大大增加了这方面的任务。
    结合经济发展，适应生产需要，数学工作者提出了数学发展的纲
    根据上述，在中国数学会代表大会上，大家一致同意以下列五个方面的问题作为数学发展的纲：
      1、尖端技术和重大工程中的数学问题：例如原子能技术、星际航行、高速飞行、无线电电子技术、大型工程（水利、建筑等）、大型机器制造等等方面的问题。
      2、自动化中的数学问题：例如电子计算机、逻辑机、自动控制和遥控、电模拟、大型
  电子系统、通讯技术、高级神经控制、机器翻译等方面的数学问题。
    3、现代物理学中的数学问题：这涉及原子核理论、基本粒子理论、固体电子理论等方面的数学问题。
    4、国民经济中的数学问题：例如工业合理布局、水库综合利用、交通运输、物资调拨、公众事业、工农业生产过程等中的数学问题。
    5、大量计算的任务：主要是高效率使用现代计算技术设备来从事大量数值计算，解决生产实际提出的各种实际数学问题。
    数学内部有众多的学科，但它本身却又是有机的整体。从当前实际需要来说，有的学科联系较多较直接，就要看作是重点发展的；有些学科的联系较少或较间接，就要当作一般发展的。总的说来，是以上述五个方面的需要为纲，带动整个数学发展。我们提出的这五个方面为纲，不但使数学理论的提高和学科发展的目的性更明确，而且为理论的提高和学科的发展提供了最好的保证。反过来，理论的提高和学科的发展也就使我们更好地完成任务，解决实际问题。
    说到发展数学，不只涉及数学工作者的专门研究，由于数学是一门基础学科，它是理工科高等教育中一个重要环节，也是人类一般文化的重要组成部分。随着我国技术革新和技术革命的飞速进展，随着我国广大人民文化水平的迅速提高，我们必须有效地提高我国数学教育的水平。从小学到大学，怎样用又快又扎实的方式教给学生最有用最新的数学知识，培养他们独立思考并灵活运用所学到的数学知识的能力，不只对于培养专门的科学技术人材是必需的，就是培养现代的工人农民，也是必要的。中国数学会第二次代表大会的第二个议题，就是数学课程的改革问题。大会上特别讨论了中小学的数学课程问题。检查了过去的数学课程内容，我们大家一致认为，这些内容基本上乃是十六、十七世纪以前人类所获得的数学知识，陈旧落后，孤立重复，割裂烦琐，脱离实际，远远不符合我国社会主义建设飞跃发展的需要。因此我们必须从根本上改革，打破从资本主义国家传来的几百年来未曾变过的陈旧体系；根据我国社会主义建设实际的要求和数学现代发展的情况，重新拟定新的教学计划、教学大纲和教材来。在会上北京师范大学数学系提出了数学教学内容革新方案，会上大家原则上同意北京师范大学方案的革命精神，也一致要求应当本着年限短、质量高的原则，培养社会主义建设青年劳动者，同时也提出了不少补充和修正的意见。目前，各高等学校也在纷纷拟出新方案。在党的领导下，各级数学课程的根本性改革已经形成了群众运动，这将大大提高我国的数学教育水平，从而也就大大有利于科学技术水平的提高。
    总之，在毛泽东思想的指导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我国数学已经走上历史上一个崭新的时期，大闹数学革命已经成为全国数学界中广泛流传的口号。在党的领导下，我们数学工作者一定要迅速地完成这一伟大的使命。
