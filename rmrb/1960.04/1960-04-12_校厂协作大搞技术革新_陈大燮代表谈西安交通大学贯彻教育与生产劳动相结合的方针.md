Comrade Representatives:
    I fully agree with and support the reports made to the congress by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and I am willing to work hard to implement them.

    I would like to talk about my opinions on the combination of education and productive labor, and the combination of teaching with technological innovation and technological revolution in factories:

    Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: "The vast numbers of workers, peasants, and intellectuals in our country are launching a magnificent technological innovation and technological revolution movement with irresistible force." Vice Premier Li made a high assessment of the important significance of the current technological innovation and technological revolution movement in our country. It will be an important guarantee for the successful completion of our country's 1960 national economic plan and the rapid development of socialist construction.

    The combination of education and productive labor is the most important content of the Party's education policy. We must rely on the combination of education and productive labor to promote the laborization of intellectuals; we must rely on the combination of education and productive labor to combine theory with practice and rapidly improve teaching quality; we must rely on the combination of education and productive labor to promote the gradual establishment of labor viewpoints, class viewpoints, mass viewpoints, and dialectical materialism viewpoints among the vast numbers of teachers and students. Proceeding from the current situation, combining the technological innovation and technological revolution movement in industrial and agricultural production with school education has even greater practical and political significance. Our Xi'an Jiaotong University has learned in the process of implementing the above spirit: To make the combination of education and productive labor better, in addition to establishing necessary labor bases in the school, it is also necessary to establish cooperative relationships with off-campus factories to create production labor bases, according to the settings of our own disciplines. We have learned that the production base in the school alone cannot meet the needs of every discipline, and the actual production problems encountered by the production base in the school cannot meet the comprehensive requirements of teachers and students of various disciplines when linking to practical activities. We began to establish cooperative relationships with off-campus factories and mines to establish production bases last year. After nearly a year of practical exploration and research, this relationship has gradually been consolidated and has developed greatly towards soundness and balance. In February of this year, our school organized more than 2,400 students in the fourth and fifth grades of more than 20 majors, including mechanical manufacturing, power machinery manufacturing, and electrical machinery, and more than 300 teachers to go to more than 60 factories for productive labor. Some teachers and students reached the factory with nearly a hundred people, and some reached twenty or thirty people. In a very short period of time, this group of teachers and students who went to the factory for production has achieved great results in actual production. As of mid-March, they have assisted factories in more than 1,300 relatively significant technological innovation projects, including 75 automatic lines and more than 400 automated single machines. These technological innovation projects have greatly promoted the production of these factories. Here are two examples to illustrate: one is the creation of a machine in an insulation material factory, saving more than 710 labors. Another example is the construction of an automatic casting line in a factory, reducing the working area to one-seventh of the original, reducing labor to one-third of the original, while the output has increased three times.

    Through actual labor training, teachers and students have taken a big step towards the laborization of intellectuals. After arriving at the factory, most of the teachers and students went to the workshop to eat, live, and work with the workers. Through practical operation and living with the workers, they realized the greatness and arduousness of labor, established friendship and feelings with the working class, and thus more firmly established the courage and determination to vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution. For example, some teachers and students went to work in the paint tank with the workers, and the strong paint smell made their eyes tear, but they still insisted on their work without slackening. Some teachers and students were deeply moved by the workers' heroic spirit of not fearing hardships, difficulties, and optimism, and were deeply inspired by the workers' soaring enthusiasm and communist style in vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution. Therefore, in productive labor, they can work with the workers to study and find ways to study the problems in technological innovation, and propose reasonable suggestions for technological innovation.

    Through actual operation and technological innovation, the practical knowledge level of teachers and students has been greatly improved, thereby further consolidating and enriching the original theoretical knowledge. For example, when carrying out an automatic welding line in an electrical appliance factory, we were initially ignorant and unable to start. After independent theoretical study and joint research with workers and technicians, we launched a defense meeting with the joint participation of the factory Party committee, the factory director, workers, and technicians. After the defense, the plan was determined, and the machine was made according to the plan and put into trial operation. Obviously, without factory cooperation and the practical operating experience of workers, it would be impossible to solve the above-mentioned problems in technological innovation with the limited theoretical knowledge of teachers and students.

    In the factory production labor, teachers and students also widely assisted the factory in opening cultural refresher courses and professional and basic course lectures for workers, which played a certain good role in improving workers' scientific and cultural knowledge level and promoting factory-run schools.

    Based on my personal experience, the following issues must be paid attention to when school-factory cooperates to vigorously promote technological innovation and technological revolution.

    1. Factory-school integration can only achieve better results under the principle of "five combinations." The so-called five combinations are that under the leadership of the factory Party committee, we must achieve the concerted efforts of workers, technicians, students, and teachers. To achieve the combination of these five aspects, our experience is that teachers and students must be sent to the workshop, because only by going to the workshop can we contact actual production and carry out work. A very small number of factories initially kept teachers and students in the offices, which had a certain impact on the work. We created an automatic machine for manufacturing parts with small circles at both ends in the low-voltage switch factory. At the beginning, the workers had such an idea, but it was not concrete. Later, the students turned the workers' ideas into design drawings, which were discussed and revised by the workers. With the enthusiastic support of the factory Party committee, the machine was quickly manufactured and put into production. This example shows that only under the leadership of the factory Party committee and in close combination with the workers can the wisdom and strength of teachers and students be brought into play in technological innovation and technological revolution.

    2. When organizing teachers and students to go to the factory, the relevant majors can go to a factory together, which facilitates the development of technological innovation work. When we started organizing teachers and students to go to the factory, we only considered the object of going to the factory from a professional point of view. Those who studied machinery only went to the machinery factory, and those who studied electrical machinery only went to the electrical machinery factory, but the problem could not be solved. Later, we re-organized them, supplemented each other, and received good results. We once encountered a research topic that was solved by teachers and students from four departments and twelve majors. The above-mentioned automatic casting line involves knowledge of casting, smelting, mechanical manufacturing, electrical appliances, and other majors. The students who participated in the work not only consolidated and developed their original professional knowledge, but also learned a lot of knowledge from other majors. From this point of view, it can also be said that professional large-scale collaboration is indeed providing a good way to cultivate talents who are both red and expert in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. It is the path of redness, because it cultivates the spirit of collectivism; it is the path of expertise, because it broadens the knowledge of business.

    3. After the factory-school cooperation is carried out, in order to consolidate this cooperative relationship, facilitate mutual support, and make long-term plans, factories and schools can sign cooperative contracts. Xi'an Jiaotong University is currently signing long-term contracts with relevant factories. The contract forms include individual items, those based on one major, one department, and comprehensive ones.

    4. Factory-school cooperation is still a new thing for us. We must summarize the experience in this area in time and continuously improve the cooperative relationship. In the previous period, we held many on-site meetings in the power capacitor factory, power machinery factory, etc., to summarize and improve our work. Recently, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a larger-scale on-site meeting at our school. After this meeting, our work will definitely be further promoted.

    The combination of education and productive labor, the cooperation between schools and factories, and the vigorous promotion of technological innovation and technological revolution are still new things, and we lack experience. Please correct any improprieties mentioned above.

    I wish all representatives good health.

    校厂协作大搞技术革新
    陈大燮代表谈西安交通大学贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春、李先念两位副总理向大会所作的报告，并愿为之贯彻而努力。
    我想就教育与生产劳动相结合、教学与工厂中的技术革新和技术革命相结合的问题谈一点意见：
    李富春副总理在报告中指出：“我国广大的工人、农民和知识分子，正在以破竹之势，开展波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动”。李副总理对我国目前的技术革新和技术革命运动的重要意义作了很高的估价，它将是我国1960年国民经济计划胜利完成和社会主义建设迅速发展的重要保证。
    教育与生产劳动相结合，是党的教育方针的最主要的内容。我们要依靠教育与生产劳动相结合来促进知识分子的劳动化；要依靠教育与生产劳动相结合使理论结合实际，迅速提高教学质量；要依靠教育与生产劳动相结合来促进广大师生逐渐树立劳动观点、阶级观点、群众观点和辩证唯物主义的观点。从当前形势出发，把工农业生产中的技术革新和技术革命运动与学校教育结合起来，就更有它的重大现实意义和政治意义。我们西安交通大学在贯彻上述精神中体会到：要使教育与生产劳动结合得更好一些，除在校内建立必须的劳动基地以外，还必须根据自己的专业设置情况与校外工厂建立生产劳动基地的协作关系。我们体会到，光校内生产基地不可能照顾到每个专业的需要，而且校内生产基地所遇到的生产实际问题，更不能满足各专业师生联系实际时的全面要求。与校外厂矿建立生产基地的协作关系，我们是从去年就开始的，经过将近一年的实际摸索研究，使这种关系逐渐巩固，并向健全平衡方面有了很大的发展。今年2月我校又组织了机械制造，动力机械制造及电机等二十几个专业的四、五年级学生二千四百余人，教师三百余人，分别到六十余个工厂去进行生产劳动。到达工厂生产的师生有的接近百人，少则达到二、三十人。在很短的时期内，这批下厂的师生，在实际生产中已经取得了很大的成绩。截止3月中旬，他们协助工厂进行的较有重大意义的技术革新项目即达一千三百余件，其中包括自动线七十五条，单机自动化四百余台。这些技术革新项目对这些工厂的生产起了很大的促进作用。这里可以举两个例子来说明，一个是在绝缘材料厂中创制了一台机器，节省劳动力七百一十余个。另一个例子是在某一厂中搞起一套浇铸自动线，减少工作地面到原有的七分之一，减少劳力到原有的三分之一，而产量则提高了三倍。
    经过实际劳动锻炼，师生向知识分子劳动化迈进了一大步。师生到工厂后绝大多数是下到车间与工人同吃同住同劳动的，通过实际操作和与工人共同生活，使他们体会到劳动的伟大和艰巨，与工人阶级建立了友谊和感情，因而更加坚定了大搞技术革新和技术革命的勇气和决心。如有些师生与工人一起到油漆槽中去工作，强烈的油漆气味熏得他们眼泪直流，但仍毫不懈怠的坚持着工作。有些师生深为工人的不畏艰巨、不怕困难和乐观豪迈的英雄气概所感动，深受工人对大搞技术革新和技术革命的冲天干劲和共产主义风格所激发，因而在生产劳动中便能与工人共同研究千方百计地钻研技术革新中的问题，提出技术革新的合理建议。
    经过实际的操作和搞技术革新，大大地提高了师生的实际知识水平，从而更加巩固和丰富了原有理论知识。例如在一个电器厂里进行一个焊接自动线时，我们起初都是一窍不通，无从下手，经过独立的理论学习和工人、技术员共同研究后，才在厂党委、厂长、工人、技术员的共同参与下，开展了一次答辩会，经过答辩确定了方案，又根据方案制成机器投入运行试验。显然，不通过工厂协作和工人的实际操作经验，企图以师生的有限的理论知识要解决上述技术革新中的问题是不可能的。
    师生在工厂生产劳动中，也广泛地协助工厂为工人开设了文化补习班和专业、基础课的讲授班，为提高工人科学文化知识水平，推进工厂办学起了一定的良好作用。
    根据我个人的体会，校厂协作大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，必须注意下列几个问题。
    1、厂校结合必须在“五结合”的原则下才能收到更好的效果。所谓五结合就是在厂党委的领导下，要做到工人、技术员、学生和老师的同心协力。要达到这五个方面的结合，我们的体会是必须把师生下放到车间，因为只有到车间才能接触实际生产，开展工作。有极少数的厂子，开始把师生留在科室，使工作受到一定的影响。我们在低压开关厂中创造了一架两头带小圆圈的零件制造的自动机。开始时工人有这样的设想，但没有具体化，其后同学们把工人的设想变成设计图纸，又经过工人的讨论修补，在厂党委的热情支持下，使这台机器很快制成投入生产。这个例子说明只有在厂党委的领导下与工人密切结合，才能发挥师生在技术革新和技术革命的智慧和力量。
    2、在组织师生下厂时，各个有关的专业可以共同去一个工厂，这样便利于技术革新工作的开展。我们开始组织师生下厂时，只从专业考虑下厂的对象，学机械的只到机械厂，学电机的只到电机厂，结果是解决不了问题。其后另行组织，互相交插补充，便收到良好的效果。我们曾经遇到过一个研究课题，是经过四个系，十二个专业的师生共同研究解决的。上述浇铸自动线，要牵涉到铸工、冶炼、机械制造、电器等各个专业的知识，参加工作的同学不但巩固和发展了自己原有的专业知识，也学到了许多其他专业的知识。从这个意义上也可以这样说，专业大协作确实是提供了一条多快好省地培养又红又专的人材的好途径。是红的途径，因为培养了集体主义的精神；是专的途径，因为广泛了业务的知识。
    3、当厂校协作开展以后，为了巩固这种协作关系，便利于互相支援，长期打算，可以厂、校订立协作合同。西安交通大学，目前正在与有关工厂订立长期合同，其合同形式有单项的，有以一个专业为主的，有一个系的，也有全面的。
    4、厂校协作对于我们还是一件新事情，必须及时总结这方面的经验、不断改进协作关系。前一个时期我们曾在电力电容器厂、动力机械厂等开过多次现场会议，总结改进工作，最近中共陕西省委又在我校召开较大范围的现场会议，经过这次会议，对我们的工作一定会更大的推进一步。
    教育与生产劳动相结合，学校与工厂协作，大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，还是件新事情，我们还缺乏经验。上述不妥之处，请各位代表指正。
    祝各位代表身体健康。
