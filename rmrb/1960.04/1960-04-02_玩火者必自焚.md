Those Who Play with Fire Will Perish by It
By Our Staff Commentator

The Greek Supreme Court recently, in defiance of the will of the Greek people and world public opinion, rejected the appeal of Greek national hero Manolis Glezos and other patriots, upholding the unreasonable verdict of the military court. In doing so, the reactionary ruling clique of Greece has, in effect, officially declared its resolute hostility towards the Greek people.

Since the Greek authorities’ illegal trial of Glezos and other patriots last July, they have placed themselves in the position of the accused. Glezos and others' righteous defense and accusations have mercilessly exposed the Greek ruling clique’s crimes of betraying national interests and persecuting patriotic forces, making the broad masses of the Greek people more aware of the anti-people nature of the Greek ruling clique. The Greek people's struggle for democracy, freedom, and peace has become even more vigorous.

It is precisely because of this reason that the Greek Karamanlis government is attempting to maintain its position by strengthening its reign of terror. On the one hand, it insists on persecuting Glezos and other patriotic individuals, and at the same time, it intensifies the suppression of the entire democratic movement. The Greek government recently imprisoned Stelios Strelkou, a prominent Greek trade union leader, in a concentration camp, plotting to assassinate him; and recently, it has also carried out large-scale searches and arrests of patriotic democrats, preparing to unreasonably try them under the fabricated charge of "conducting espionage activities." More than fifty patriotic individuals are about to be tried.

It must be seen that these activities of the Greek authorities to strengthen the suppression of domestic democratic forces are part of their plot to further betray national interests. The Karamanlis government recently agreed to allow the United States to establish nuclear missile bases on Greek territory, and recently it is also preparing to allow West German militarism to reacquire military bases in Greece. The Greek government's practice of pushing the country into the abyss of war will naturally arouse strong opposition from the Greek people. The broad masses of the Greek people are constantly opposing the government's policies that violate national interests with practical actions such as strikes, demonstrations, and rallies. Many Greek political parties and bourgeois political leaders, including former Greek government ministers and members of parliament, have also expressed dissatisfaction. The Greek ruling clique obviously wants to use fascist terror to clear the way for its traitorous plots.

However, as the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party pointed out in its recent letter to the Greek people: no terroristic measures by the Greek government can stop the Greek people's struggle for easing tensions and for peace and democracy. And in this struggle, the Greek Communist Party has always stood at the forefront. No matter what verdict the Greek reactionary authorities have made against Glezos and others, no matter what further persecution the Greek authorities will carry out against democratic and patriotic forces, the Greek people's struggle to save Glezos and other patriotic individuals and to abolish the reactionary Law No. 375 will continue until true democratic freedom is restored in Greece. Those who play with fire will perish by it, and this will be the fate of the Karamanlis government.

    玩火者必自焚
    本报评论员
    希腊最高法院最近悍然不顾希腊人民和世界公众的意志，驳回了希腊民族英雄格列索斯和其他爱国人士的上诉，坚持军事法庭的无理判决。这样，希腊的反动统治集团无异最后正式宣判了他们自己坚决与希腊人民为敌。
    自从去年7月希腊当局对格列索斯和其他爱国者进行非法审讯以来，就一直使自己陷于被告的地位。格列索斯等人义正词严的辩护和控诉，无情地揭露了希腊统治集团出卖民族利益、迫害爱国力量的罪恶行径，使广大的希腊人民更加认清了希腊统治集团的反人民的面目。希腊人民争取民主、自由与和平的斗争更加高涨起来了。
    正是因为这样的原故，希腊卡拉曼利斯政府企图以加强恐怖统治来维持它的地位。它一面坚持对格列索斯等爱国志士的迫害，同时还加紧对整个民主运动的镇压。希腊政府不久前把希腊著名工会领袖斯特尔究囚禁在集中营里，阴谋加以暗害；最近又大肆搜捕爱国民主人士，准备以捏造的所谓“进行间谍活动”为名加以无理审讯，即将受审的爱国人士已有五十多名。
    必须看到，希腊当局这一些加强镇压国内民主力量的活动，是它企图进一步出卖民族利益的阴谋的一部分。卡拉曼利斯政府不久以前曾经同意了让美国在希腊领土上建立原子火箭基地，最近又准备让西德军国主义重新在希腊取得军事基地。希腊政府这种把国家推向战争深渊的做法，当然不能不激起希腊人民的强烈反对。希腊广大人民不断以罢工、示威游行和集会的实际行动来反对政府违背民族利益的政策。希腊的许多政党和资产阶级的政治领袖包括前希腊政府大臣和议员也纷纷表示不满。希腊统治集团显然想用法西斯恐怖手段来为它的卖国阴谋廓清道路。
    但是，正如希腊共产党中央委员会不久以前发表的告希腊人民书中所指出的：希腊政府任何恐怖手段都不能阻止希腊人民争取缓和紧张局势，争取和平和民主的斗争。而在这个斗争中，希腊共产党是一直站在最前列的。不管希腊反动当局对格列索斯等人已作出了什么样的判决，不管希腊当局还要对民主爱国力量进行什么样进一步的迫害，希腊人民为拯救格列索斯和其他爱国人士、争取废除反动的第三百七十五号法律的斗争定将进行下去，直到在希腊恢复真正的民主自由。玩火者必自焚，这将是卡拉曼利斯政府的下场。
