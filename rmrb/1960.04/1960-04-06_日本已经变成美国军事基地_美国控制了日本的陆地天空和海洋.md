    Japan Has Become a US Military Base
    US Controls Japan's Land, Sky, and Sea
    (Comprehensive report from our newspaper) Since the signing of the US-Japan military treaty, the United States has further strengthened its control over Japan. Japan has now completely become a US military base for aggression in Asia.

    "Japan Social News" recently published an article exposing the widespread establishment of US military bases throughout Japan and the infringement upon Japanese sovereignty and the people's lives. The article states that there are 300 US military bases on Japan's narrow territory. The area occupied by these US military bases is equal to nine times the size of Tokyo. "From Hokkaido in the north to Nagasaki in the south, every important place has US military bases. Japan has no jurisdiction within the US military bases. Even after the signing of the peace treaty, Japan remains under the complete rule of the US military."

    The article states that residents living around the bases are threatened daily by jet planes flying overhead. They believe that the living rights of the Japanese people have been violated due to the existence of US military bases.

    The article also points out that the lives of Japanese fishermen have also been severely affected. The US military has designated 28 areas off the Japanese coast as training zones. In these areas, except for Sundays and holidays, exercises involving the dropping of model atomic bombs, rocket artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and machine guns are conducted daily for several consecutive days.

    According to a revelation by "Akahata" (Red Flag newspaper), the US military in Japan now completely controls Japan's airspace. US military aircraft can fly freely in Japan.

    At Johnson Air Base in Saitama Prefecture, there is an underground command post called "Tokyo Center" that issues instructions to all US aircraft flying in the vast region of the Far East—including Japan and Korea—and to all US air bases in the Far East.

    "Akahata" says that this "Tokyo Center" is in contact with the Fifth Strategic Air Force Command stationed in Fuchu. Although the Kishi Nobusuke government claimed last year that the United States had returned control of Japanese airspace to Japan, the fact proves that control remains in the hands of the United States.

    日本已经变成美国军事基地
    美国控制了日本的陆地天空和海洋
    本报综合报道　在日美军事条约签订以后，美国进一步加强对日本的控制，日本现在已完全变为美国在亚洲的军事侵略基地。
    “日本社会新闻”最近刊登了一篇文章，揭露美国在日本全国各地遍设军事基地以及日本主权、人民生活遭受侵害的情况。文章说：在日本这狭小的国土上有着三百个美军基地。这些美军基地所占的面积等于东京都的九倍。“北起北海道南至长崎的每一个重要地方都设有美军基地。在美军基地内日本没有裁判权。即使签订了和约，日本仍然处于美军的完全统治之下。”
    文章说：在基地周围居住的居民，每天都受着在头上掠空而过的喷气式飞机的威胁。他们认为日本人民的生活权利由于存在着美军基地而受到了侵犯。
    文章还指出，日本渔民的生活也受到了严重的影响。美军划定日本沿岸的二十八处水域作为训练区。在这些区域里，除了星期日和节日以外，每天都进行接连数日的投掷模型原子弹演习以及火箭炮、高射炮和机关炮的实弹演习。
    另据“赤旗报”揭露，驻日美军现在完全控制着日本的天空。美军飞机可以在日本自由飞行。
    在埼玉县的约翰逊空军基地，有一个名叫“东京中心”的地下司令部，向在远东广阔地区——包括日本、朝鲜——飞行的所有美国飞机和美国在远东的所有空军基地发出指示。
    “赤旗报”说，这个“东京中心”同驻在府中的第五战略航空队司令部取得联系。尽管岸信介政府去年曾经声称美国已经把日本的飞行控制权归还日本，但是事实证明控制权仍然掌握在美国手里。
