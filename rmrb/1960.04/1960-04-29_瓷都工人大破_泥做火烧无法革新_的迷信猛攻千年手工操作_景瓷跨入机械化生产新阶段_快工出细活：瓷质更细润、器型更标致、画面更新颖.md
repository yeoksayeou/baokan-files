(By Our Correspondent) Jingdezhen, Jiangxi—The long-cherished desire of Jingdezhen porcelain industry workers for "fast work producing fine products" is gradually being realized. The massive technological innovation and technical revolution movement has rapidly increased the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization in porcelain production, and manual operation has been relegated to a secondary and subordinate position. From now on, the world-renowned "Jingdezhen Porcelain" has begun to enter a new stage of mechanized production that is faster, better, and more economical. Machine-made "Jingdezhen Porcelain" is not only produced in greater quantities and at lower costs, but also has finer and whiter porcelain, more standard and novel shapes, and further innovation in design styles.

For more than a thousand years, Jingdezhen porcelain making has relied on manual forming, sun-drying, and pine-wood firing, all manual operations. Heavy labor, slow operation, and high costs have limited the further improvement and development of "Jingdezhen Porcelain." After liberation, the Party and the government took many effective measures to reduce the heavy physical labor of workers. Since last year, the Jingdezhen Municipal Party Committee has led the city's broad masses of workers to break the superstition that "clay and fire cannot be innovated" and to vigorously promote a technical revolution. As of now, workers throughout the city have proposed more than 30,000 technical innovation suggestions, using simple and indigenous methods combined with foreign techniques, and have produced thousands of mechanized and semi-mechanized machines and equipment, achieving a series of technical innovations such as mechanical pressing and grouting, kiln drying, coal-fired kilns, and scientific painting. Labor efficiency has significantly improved. Last year, the city's porcelain industry completed the state plan 52 days ahead of schedule. In the first quarter of this year, with production tasks doubled compared to the same period last year and a reduction in personnel, the plan was completed half a month ahead of schedule.

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the Jingdezhen porcelain industry has always paid attention to the requirements of "high output and high quality." Workers have repeatedly improved each innovative machine and equipment to give it the dual advantages of "high output and high quality." The machine for pressing high-grade export soup plates created by Zhang Shuigui, a worker at the Red Star Porcelain Factory, has been improved many times. It not only increases work efficiency by five times, but also increases the product qualification rate by more than 10% compared to manual operation. Workers in the raw material refining process, which is closely related to the quality of porcelain, have created water wave pools, wooden clay mixing machines, and clay filtering machines, which can replace the heavy labor of one or two hundred workers manually stirring and treading. The refined raw materials such as porcelain clay are pure and dense, and the porcelain produced avoids problems such as air bubbles and pinholes. After the forming process is mechanized with mechanical pressing and grouting, the shortcomings of inconsistent size, thickness, and height, which were difficult to avoid with manual forming in the past, have been eliminated. For example, high-grade lotus-shaped and bud-shaped coffee sets for export, after being formed by one-time grouting, not only reduce several manual steps, but also make the products round and smooth, with standard shapes and unified specifications, making them more popular in foreign markets. Through technological innovation, "Jingdezhen Porcelain" quality has achieved a large-scale harvest, and more than ten large porcelain factories in the city have met quality targets every month.

The excellent tradition of "Jingdezhen Porcelain" art has also been further promoted in technical innovation. Thanks to the bold thinking and action of the broad masses of workers and art personnel, more than a thousand new products and new designs with novel shapes, beautiful patterns, and rich national style have been innovated and created in the past year. In the first three months of this year alone, the workers of the Jianguo Porcelain Factory created more than 120 kinds of beautiful and practical new products and 62 new paintings, and also successfully tested two color glazes: osmanthus yellow and green fruit. The painting and carving techniques of high-grade fine porcelain and arts and crafts porcelain were almost considered impossible to innovate and could only be copied and carved by hand. Now, new methods such as printing instead of painting and machines such as printing machines and gold-plating machines can completely replace manual work, with equally good quality. Li Yongxing, an old carving worker at the Jianguo Porcelain Factory, has made two major reforms to the carving process. According to his innovative method of producing high-grade celadon cloud crane tea sets, three sets can be made in one working day (it used to take four working days to make one set), and the patterns are lifelike. The electric circulating printing machine created by the painting workers can print for one hour and is equivalent to forty working days of manual operation, and can print various patterns and multiple colors, which are neat, beautiful, and brightly colored, surpassing the quality of manual operation. The Artistic Porcelain Factory, which specializes in painting and processing, has maintained an advanced level of quality throughout the innovation process, and the quality indicators for the first quarter of this year have exceeded 99% every month.

At present, the technical revolution movement in Jingdezhen is advancing towards full mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. The whiteness of "Jingdezhen Porcelain" has increased from 84% to 89%, reaching the world peak of porcelain whiteness. There are also many exquisite high-grade handicrafts, such as thin-bodied porcelain as thin as paper, veils like real yarn, and various high-grade colored glaze porcelains, which now have scientific production methods, enabling these products to be produced in large quantities to meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets.

Yu Changren, an innovation expert at the Jingdezhen Red Star Porcelain Factory, innovated a semi-automatic circulating double-knife ring pressing machine, which changed the manual operation of ring pressing and polishing that has been used since ancient times, increasing work efficiency by more than seven times and improving product quality.

### 瓷都工人大破“泥做火烧无法革新”的迷信猛攻千年手工操作  景瓷跨入机械化生产新阶段  快工出细活：瓷质更细润、器型更标致、画面更新颖

    瓷都工人大破“泥做火烧无法革新”的迷信猛攻千年手工操作
    景瓷跨入机械化生产新阶段
    快工出细活：瓷质更细润、器型更标致、画面更新颖
    本报讯　江西省景德镇瓷业职工多年向往的“快工出细活”的愿望，正在逐步实现。声势浩大的技术革新和技术革命运动，使瓷业生产的机械化半机械化水平迅速提高，手工操作已经退居到次要和从属的地位。从此，世界驰名的“景德镇瓷器”开始进入多快好省的机械化生产的新阶段。机制的“景瓷”，不仅产量高，成本低，而且瓷质更加细润洁白，器型更加标致新颖，画面风格进一步推陈出新。
    一千多年来，景德镇制瓷都是手工成型、太阳干燥、松柴烧炼等手工操作。笨重的劳动，缓慢的操作和昂贵的成本，限制了“景瓷”的进一步提高和发展。解放以后，党和政府在减轻职工笨重体力劳动方面曾经采取过许多有效措施。去年以来，中共景德镇市委更领导全市广大职工，大破瓷器“泥做火烧无法革新”的迷信，大闹技术革命。截至目前为止，全市职工已提出三万多件技术革新建议，用因陋就简、土洋结合的办法，制成了上千件机械化半机械化的机具设备，实现了机压和注浆成型、烘房干燥、煤窑烧炼、科学彩绘等一系列的技术革新。劳动效率显著提高。去年全市瓷业生产提前五十二天完成国家计划。今年第一季度，在生产任务比去年同期增加两倍而人员又有所减少的情况下，提前半个月完成了计划。
    景德镇瓷业的技术革新和技术革命运动，始终注意了“高产优质”的要求。职工对每一件革新的机具设备都进行了反复的改进，使其具有“高产优质”的双重优点。红星瓷厂工人张水贵创造的压制高级出口汤盘的机具，经过多次改进，不但提高工效五倍，而且产品的合格率还比手工操作提高10％以上。与瓷质有密切关系的原料精制工序的职工们，创制了水波池、木质炼泥机、滤泥机等，可以代替一、二百个工人手搅脚踩的笨重劳动，精制出来的瓷土等原料纯净、密实，制成的瓷器避免了气泡、针孔等毛病。成型工序实现机压和注浆后，消灭了过去手工成型难以避免的大小、厚薄、高矮不一等缺点。如出口的莲蓬型、花蕾型的高级咖啡具，实行一次注浆成型以后，不仅减少了几道手工，还使产品圆润光滑，外型标致，规格统一，在国外市场更加受到欢迎。通过技术革新，“景瓷”质量获得了大面积的丰收，全市十多个较大的瓷厂，月月达到质量指标。
    “景瓷”艺术的优良传统，在技术革新中也得到了进一步的发扬。由于广大职工和美术人员敢想敢做，一年来革新和创造了造型新颖、画面美观和富有民族风格的新产品和新画面各一千多种。仅建国瓷厂职工在今年头三个月内，就创造了一百二十多种美观实用的新产品和六十二件新画花，还试验成功桂花黄、青果绿两种颜色釉。高级细瓷、工艺美术瓷的彩绘、雕镂工艺，几乎被人认为只能用手工摹雕，无法革新。如今，以印代画等新的方法和印花机、镶金机等机具，完全可以代替手工，质量同样良好。建国瓷厂老雕刻工李永兴，对雕刻工艺进行了两次重大的改革；按照他的革新方法生产天青云鹤高级茶具，一个工作日可以制成三套（过去要四个工作日才能制一套），而且画面栩栩如生。彩绘工人创造的电动循环印花机，开动一个小时就可以抵得上手工操作四十个工作日，而且可以印绘出各种花样和多种色彩，整齐美观，色彩鲜艳，赛过手工操作的质量。专门彩绘加工的艺术瓷厂，革新中质量一直保持先进水平，今年第一季度的质量指标月月超过99％。
    目前，景德镇的技术革命运动，正在向全面机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化进军。“景瓷”的白度，已由84％达到89％，攀上瓷器白度的世界高峰。还有许多精美的高级手工艺品，如薄如纸的薄胎瓷器、真纱般的小孩披纱，以及各种高级的颜色釉瓷器，如今都有了科学的生产方法，使这些产品能成批大量地生产，满足国内外市场的需要。
    景德镇红星瓷厂革新能手余昌仁革新的半自动循环双刀压环机，改变了自古以来压环磨光用手工操作，提高工效七倍多，并且提高了产品质量
