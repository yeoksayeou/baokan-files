Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 13th: The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" today published a commentary entitled "Factors for Peace in Asia and the World," saying that under the wise and far-sighted leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Mao Zedong, the great Chinese people are advancing at an astonishing speed on the broad road of building socialism. The recent Second Session of the Second National People's Congress of China held in Beijing reflected China's vigorous Great Leap Forward in developing and consolidating the national economy.

The commentary pointed out that when the Chinese Communist Party put forward the slogan "Catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years," the imperialist bloc and their newspapers called it a "fantasy," and the Belgrade revisionists, echoing the same tune, also said that "China's economic plan is built on sand." But life in a very short period proved that it was the enemies of China who were building on "sand." The slander of the enemies of peace and socialism against the Chinese people went bankrupt as early as last year, when China completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan within two years.

The commentary said that on the basis of these magnificent achievements, the Chinese National People's Congress passed this year's plan. The realization of this plan will make it possible to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in less than ten years. Now the imperialist bloc and its running dogs are silent in the face of these victories and prospects, or are forced to admit them.

The commentary concluded by saying that the Albanian people are heartily rejoiced at the magnificent achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people in socialist construction and the grand prospects opened up by China's plan for "continued Great Leap Forward" this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 13th: "Labor Daily" published an article today entitled "Three Magic Weapons of China's Socialist Construction," commenting on the Second Session of the Chinese National People's Congress. The article emphasized that "the entire meeting once again demonstrated the firm unity of the Chinese people in building socialism and confirmed that the great plans that the Chinese comrades are striving to implement are realistic."

The newspaper pointed out that on the basis of the achievements made in China's economic construction last year, new and bold tasks were put forward for 1960. The newspaper said that the current smooth development of China's economy is the result of the wise policy of the Chinese Communist Party. The newspaper emphasized that this policy is also a guarantee for achieving new victories in the future.

The newspaper said that the Chinese Communist Party, according to the characteristics of China's economy and the fact that China is still a large agricultural country that is economically backward compared with the most advanced socialist and capitalist countries, has enriched the general principles of socialist construction with new factors.

The newspaper said that the Chinese Communist Party has proved that under the socialist system, the national economy can develop at the speed of a Great Leap Forward; they created the people's commune system.

The newspaper said that, as pointed out by the Second Session of the National People's Congress, the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are the three "magic weapons" of China's socialist construction and will continue to guide the three principles of the Chinese working people.

    阿“人民之声报”评我国今年国民经济计划
    中国人民以惊人速度在社会主义大道上前进
    捷“劳动报”说中国证明社会主义制度下国民经济能够大跃进
    据新华社地拉那13日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”今天在一篇题为“亚洲和世界和平的因素”的评论中说，伟大的中国人民在以毛泽东为首的中国共产党英明和有远见的领导下，在建设社会主义的康庄大道上，正以惊人的速度前进。最近在北京举行的中国第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议反映了中国在发展和巩固国民经济方面的蓬勃的大跃进。
    评论指出，当中国共产党提出“十五年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国”的口号时，帝国主义集团和它们的报刊把它叫做“幻想”，贝尔格莱德修正主义者和他们唱出同样的调子，也说什么“中国的经济计划是建筑在沙滩上的”。但是在一个很短的时期内的生活证明：建立在“沙滩上”的却是中国的敌人。和平和社会主义的敌人的论调以及对中国人民的诬蔑，早在去年，即中国在两年之内完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标的时候就破产了。
    评论说，在这些宏伟成就的基础上，中国全国人民代表大会会议通过了今年的计划。实现这一计划就可能使主要工业产品的产量在十年不到的时间内赶上和超过英国。现在帝国主义集团和它的走狗们在这些胜利和前景的面前沉默了，或者是被迫地承认了。
    评论最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民为兄弟般的中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的宏伟成就，为中国今年的“继续大跃进”的计划所开辟的宏伟前景感到衷心的喜悦。
    新华社布拉格13日电　“劳动报”今天以“中国社会主义建设的三个法宝”为题发表文章，评论中国全国人民代表大会第二次会议。文章强调说，“整个会议再一次表明中国人民建设社会主义的坚强团结，并且证实中国同志们努力执行的伟大计划是现实的。”
    这家报纸指出，中国在去年的经济建设中所取得的成就的基础上，提出了1960年的新的和大胆的任务。这家报纸说，目前中国经济的顺利发展是中国共产党的英明政策的结果。报纸强调说，这个政策也是将来取得新胜利的保证。
    这家报纸说，中国共产党根据中国经济的特点，根据中国仍然是在经济上落后于最先进的社会主义国家和资本主义国家的农业大国这个事实，用新的因素丰富了社会主义建设的一般原则。
    这家报纸说，中国共产党已经证明，在社会主义制度下，国民经济能够以大跃进的速度发展；他们创立了人民公社制度。
    这家报纸说，正如全国人民代表大会第二次会议所指出的，总路线、大跃进和人民公社，是中国社会主义建设的三个“法宝”，将继续指导中国劳动人民的三个原则。
