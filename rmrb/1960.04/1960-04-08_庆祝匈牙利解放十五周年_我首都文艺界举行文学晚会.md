To celebrate the 15th anniversary of Hungary's liberation, the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Association, the Chinese Writers Association, and the Beijing Library jointly held a literary evening in the capital tonight. More than 400 people from literary and art circles, including Yan Wenjing, Sun Yong, Zuo Gong, and Guo Xiaochuan, attended the evening.

    Szigeti, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Hungarian Embassy in China, and members of the Hungarian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation who came to China to participate in the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Week also attended the evening and were warmly welcomed.

    Xiao San, Vice President of the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Association and Director of the Foreign Literature Liaison Committee of the Chinese Writers Association, delivered a speech at the meeting, warmly congratulating the glorious festival of the 15th anniversary of Hungary's liberation. Ge Baoquan, a director of the Chinese Writers Association, gave a report at the meeting entitled "The Friendship between Chinese and Hungarian Literature," which detailed the translation and publication of Hungarian literary works in China over the past fifty years, and especially mentioned the close and friendly exchanges between China and Hungary in literature over the past ten years. He said that through literary exchanges over the past decade, mutual understanding between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples has been enhanced, and the friendly unity of the two peoples has been promoted.

    Simon István, a member of the Hungarian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation and a Hungarian poet, was invited to speak at the meeting. In introducing the current situation of Hungarian literature, he said: "After the 1956 counter-revolutionary rebellion, under the strong leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Hungarian literature struggled against various bourgeois ideological tendencies, enabling Hungarian literature to embark on the correct path of vigorous development of socialist realism, producing many excellent works that educated and inspired the people." Simon István also recited his own poem "Engraved on Our Future Years," which praised the liberation of Hungary.

    The Hungarian film "Thirty-Ninth Brigade" was shown at the end of the evening.

    庆祝匈牙利解放十五周年
    我首都文艺界举行文学晚会
    新华社7日讯　中匈友好协会、中国作家协会和北京图书馆，今晚在首都联合举行庆祝匈牙利解放十五周年文学晚会。参加晚会的有严文井、孙用、左恭、郭小川等文学艺术界人士四百多人。
    匈牙利驻华大使馆临时代办西格蒂和前来我国参加中匈友好周活动的匈中友协代表团的成员也出席了晚会，并受到热烈欢迎。
    中匈友好协会副会长、中国作家协会对外文学联络委员会主任萧三在会上致词，他热烈祝贺匈牙利解放十五周年这一光辉节日。中国作家协会理事戈宝权在会上作了题为“中匈两国文学的友谊”的报告，详细介绍了五十年来匈牙利文学作品在我国翻译出版的情况，特别谈到最近十年来中匈两国在文学上密切的友好往来。他说，十年来通过文学的交流，增进了中匈两国人民了解，促进了两国人民的友好团结。
    匈中友协代表团团员、匈牙利诗人西蒙·依斯特万应邀在会上讲了话。他在介绍匈牙利文学的近况时说：“1956年反革命叛乱以后，匈牙利文学在匈牙利社会主义工人党坚强的领导下，向各种资产阶级思想倾向进行斗争，使匈牙利文学走上了社会主义现实主义蓬勃发展的正确道路，产生了许多优秀作品，教育和鼓舞着人民。”西蒙·依斯特万还在会上朗诵了他自己创作的歌颂匈牙利解放的诗篇“刻在我们未来的岁月上”。
    晚会最后放映了匈牙利电影“第三十九旅”。
