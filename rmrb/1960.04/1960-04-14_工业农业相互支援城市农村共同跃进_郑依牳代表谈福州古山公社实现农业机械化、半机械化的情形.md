Industry and Agriculture Support Each Other, Cities and Villages Leap Forward Together
Representative Zheng Yimu Speaks on the Realization of Agricultural Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization in Fuzhou Gushan Commune

Chairman, Fellow Representatives:

I fully endorse the reports made to the congress by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian. These two reports have expressed what we farmers want to say; especially after hearing Vice Premier Li Fuchun speak about the mutual support and common leap forward of industry and agriculture, cities and villages, I felt particularly happy. Our Fuzhou Gushan People's Commune has rapidly realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of agricultural production precisely because it has received strong support from industry and the city.

Our commune is a commune close to the provincial capital, Fuzhou, and is also one of the earliest communes established in Fujian Province. The whole commune has more than 6,900 households and more than 26,000 people. Before communization, there were many restrictions on using machinery for production. After communization, we can unify planning, unify the allocation of manpower and materials, and use land more rationally, so it created better conditions for the realization of mechanized production; coupled with the all-round support of the worker elders, we quickly realized mechanization and semi-mechanization. Now our commune has cars, tractors, water pumps, water turbines, electric water pumps, sprayers, artificial rainmaking machines, etc. Among them, in addition to cars and tractors supplied by the state, more than 400 handcarts and semi-mechanized machines such as wooden rice transplanters and threshing machines are manufactured by the commune's agricultural machinery factory itself. Water turbines, electric water pumps and other machines are all supported by the worker elders. Now we have tractors for cultivation, water turbines, water pumps and artificial rainmaking machines for irrigation, and cars for transportation, which have eliminated heavy physical labor such as water carrying and shoulder carrying, allowing the members to "divorce" from waterwheels and carrying poles, and the cattle have also changed careers to engage in transportation. Even pig raising has been mechanized and semi-automated. The feed cut by the machine is automatically poured into the large boiler, steamed with steam, and then automatically loaded onto the car and transported to the pigsty along the small track for the pigs to eat. The feed grinder, large boiler, and small steel rails of the pig farm are all manufactured for us by factories in Fuzhou.

Speaking of the benefits of the worker elders supporting us, it is truly endless. For example, before communization, we were most afraid of encountering drought. We had to tread on waterwheels day and night to fight the drought, suffering hardships and fatigue, and the harvest was not guaranteed. Even in the advanced cooperatives, because of the small townships and cooperatives, the strength was limited, and it was impossible to completely eliminate drought. As soon as the commune was established, we uniformly arranged the labor force of 23 production teams and organized a water management army of 10,000 people to build a large-scale water turbine pump project to divert water from the Minjiang River for irrigation; if there was not enough funds, the commune would extract a part of the public accumulation and mobilize the members to invest, raising 150,000 yuan. When we were building the earthwork and stonework project, the workers of the Fujian Provincial Farm Implement Experimental Station and the Fuzhou Machine Tool Factory rushed to manufacture six water turbines for us. Now they can pump three cubic meters of Minjiang River water per second, which can irrigate a total of 8,000 mu of farmland; in addition, the electric water pumps supplied by the Fuzhou Electric Motor Factory are equipped with artificial rainmaking machines and 23 water pumps, and the sound of creaking waterwheels can no longer be heard in the whole commune. Last winter and this spring, we encountered more than 100 days of severe drought, but the water turbines and water pumps exerted their power and overcame the drought. The members said: "If it weren't for the support of the worker elders, we would be half-dead from carrying water to water the vegetables this year," "It was impossible to water a few vegetables by carrying a load of water in the past, but now it's so refreshing to water the vegetables with machine pumping!" In terms of land reclamation, water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and road construction, the People's Liberation Army and urban people such as cadres, students, and residents also often give us support. When developing "Wanbao Mountain" this spring, they sent 10,000 people to attack with the members for ten days, reclaiming more than 15,000 mu of wasteland and planting economic crops such as peanuts, castor beans, soybeans, and fruit trees, and also established livestock farms (raising dairy cows and other livestock). The factories in Fuzhou also supported us in rapidly developing commune-run industries. In addition to transferring 16 technicians to our commune's agricultural machinery factory, they also helped us train technical personnel in batches. Now the whole commune has 17 factories including agricultural machinery, shipbuilding, brick and tile, and vermicelli, with 1,100 workers; among them, the agricultural machinery factory has also established five workshops including machinery, sand casting, and metalworking, with more than 140 workers and 55 machines of all sizes, which can produce five-horsepower diesel engines and other semi-mechanized agricultural implements. This year, the total industrial output value of the whole commune will reach 40 million yuan.

After communization, because more and more machinery and semi-machinery are used, labor productivity is also getting higher and higher. Last year, one person planted one mu of vegetables, and this year it has increased to one person planting five mu of vegetables. The labor saved in transportation is even more. For example, now an average of 1,400 loads of vegetables are picked and sent to the city every day. If each person carried one load in the past, it would take 1,400 people. After we had car transportation, only more than 20 people were enough to deliver the vegetables every day. Also, transporting manure to the city used to require nearly 2,000 people every day, but now it only takes eight people to transport it with tractors. This not only enables us to do more and better in agricultural production, but also allows us to select a large number of laborers to support the great leap forward in industrial production. In the past year or so, our commune has sent more than 2,000 young men and women to work as workers in factories. The relatively large factories in Fuzhou, such as the Bayi Steel Plant, the Fujian Machinery Factory, and the Fuzhou No. 2 Chemical Factory, all have members of our commune.

All the members of our commune are very grateful to the worker elders and the urban people for their support to us. They all say that they will grow more vegetables, raise more pigs, and grow more economic crops to support them, and they will grow them well and raise them well so that they can eat well and be full, and continue to make great leaps forward with full energy. Now the vegetables planted in the whole commune have been expanded from more than 600 mu to more than 9,000 mu (it is planned to plant 14,000 mu this year), with more than 30 varieties. There are more than 19,000 live pigs (more than 80% are collectively raised, with an average of 2.7 per household). It is planned to raise 100,000 this year. There are 1,045 dairy cows, more than 800,000 freshwater fish, and more than 39,000 small poultry and livestock such as chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits. Now the average daily supply of vegetables to the city is more than 1,400 loads, plus more than 1,000 catties of milk and a large number of eggs, chickens, ducks, rabbits, etc.; at the same time, we also guarantee to supply more than 20,000 live pigs this year, which is ten times more than last year; the supply of economic crops such as sugarcane, peanuts, and castor beans will also increase significantly compared with last year. When we develop the entire Gushan of more than 100,000 mu in the near future, we will be able to use much more vegetables, fruits, live pigs, chickens, ducks, milk, and various economic crops than now to support the larger-scale development of light industry and meet the needs of the ever-improving lives of urban people.

    工业农业相互支援城市农村共同跃进
    郑依牳代表谈福州古山公社实现农业机械化、半机械化的情形主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理向大会作的报告。这两个报告把我们农民心里要讲的话都讲出来了；特别是听到李富春副总理讲工业和农业、城市和农村互相支援、共同跃进的问题，我心里特别高兴。我们福州古山人民公社就是因为得到工业和城市的大力支援，迅速实现了农业生产机械化、半机械化。
    我们公社是紧靠省会福州市的一个公社，也是福建省最早建立的公社之一。全社有六千九百多户、二万六千多人。公社化以前，用机械搞生产还有很多限制，公社化以后，可以统一计划，统一调配人力、物力，可以更合理地使用土地，所以给实现机械化生产创造了更好的条件；加上工人老大哥各方面的支援，使我们很快就实现了机械化、半机械化。现在我们公社有了汽车、拖拉机、抽水机、水轮机、电力水泵、喷雾器、人工降雨器等等，其中除了汽车和拖拉机是国家供应的，四百多部板车和木质插秧机、打谷机等半机械化机具是公社农械厂自己制造的以外，水轮机、电力水泵等机械都是工人老大哥支援的。现在耕种有拖拉机，灌溉有水轮机、抽水机和人工降雨器，运输有车子，消灭了车水、肩挑等繁重的体力劳动，使社员们跟水车、扁担“离婚”了，耕牛也改行去搞运输了。就连养猪也实现了机械化和半自动化，用机器切好的饲料自动倒进大锅炉，用蒸气煮好以后，可以自动装上车，顺着小轨道运进猪栏给猪吃。养猪场的饲料粉碎机、大锅炉、小钢轨都是福州市的工厂给我们制造的。
    讲起工人老大哥支援我们的好处，真是讲也讲不完。比方说在公社化以前，我们最怕碰到干旱，要日日夜夜踏水车抗旱，受苦受累且不说，收成还没有保证。就是在高级社的时候，也因为小乡小社，力量有限，无法彻底消灭旱灾。公社一成立，我们就把二十三个生产队的劳力统一进行安排，组织了一万人的治水大军，兴建一个大型的水轮泵工程，引闽江的水来灌溉；资金不够，就由公社抽出一部分公共积累和发动社员投资，筹集了十五万元。我们修建土石方工程的时候，福建省农具试验场和福州机床厂的工人同志替我们赶制了六台水轮机。现在它们每一秒钟可以抽上三立方米闽江江水，总共可灌溉八千亩田园；再加上福州电机厂供给的电力水泵装上人工降雨器和二十三部抽水机，全社再也听不到咿咿呀呀的水车声了。去冬今春，我们碰到一百多天的大旱，但是水轮机、抽水机发挥了威力，战胜了干旱。社员们说：“要不是工人老大哥的支援，今年挑水浇菜要累得半死”，“过去挑一担水浇不了几棵菜，现在机器抽水浇菜真爽快！”在开荒、修水利、积肥、修路等方面，解放军和机关干部、学生、居民等城市人民，也经常给我们支援。今年春天开发“万宝山”的时候，他们就来了一万人跟社员一起突击十天，开荒一万五千多亩，种上了花生、蓖麻、大豆、果树等经济作物，还建立了畜牧场（养乳牛等家畜）。福州市的工厂还支援我们迅速发展社办工业，除了抽调十六名技术工人来我们公社农械厂以外，还帮我们成批地培养训练技术力量。现在全社有农械、造船、砖瓦、线面等十七个工厂，工人一千一百人；其中农械厂还建立了机械、翻砂、金工等五个车间，有工人一百四十多人，大小机器五十五台，能生产五马力的柴油机和其他半机械化农具。今年全社工业总产值将达到四千万元。
    公社化以后，因为使用机械、半机械越来越多，劳动生产率也越来越高。去年还是一人种一亩菜，今年提高到一人种五亩菜。运输方面节省的劳力就更多了，比方现在每天平均要挑送一千四百担蔬菜进城，要是过去每人挑一担就要一千四百人。我们有了汽车运输以后，每天只要二十多人送菜就够了。还有就是进城运粪便，过去每天需要近两千人，现在用拖拉机拖运，只要八个人。这样不但使我们的农业生产搞得更多更好，还可以挑选出大批劳力去支援工业生产大跃进。这一年多来，我们公社送了两千个以上的男女青年去工厂当工人，福州市比较大的八一钢厂、福建机器厂、福州第二化工厂等工厂都有我们公社的社员。
    我们公社全体社员都非常感谢工人老大哥和城市人民对我们的支援，都说要多种菜、多养猪、多种经济作物来支援他们，并且要种好养好，让他们吃得又饱又好，鼓足干劲继续不断地大跃进。现在全社种的蔬菜已经从六百多亩扩大到九千多亩（计划今年种一万四千亩），品种有三十多种，养生猪一万九千多头（集体饲养的占80％以上，每户平均二点七头）计划今年养到十万头。乳牛一千零四十五头，淡水鱼八十多万尾，鸡鸭鹅兔等小家禽、家畜三万九千多头，现在每天供应城市的蔬菜平均有一千四百多担，还有一千多斤牛奶和大量的蛋和鸡鸭兔等；同时我们还保证今年供应生猪两万头以上，比去年增加十倍；甘蔗、花生、蓖麻等经济作物的供应，比去年也将有大量的增加。等到不久的将来，我们把十多万亩的整个古山都开发起来的时候，我们就可以用比现在多得多的蔬菜、水果、生猪、鸡鸭、牛奶和各种经济作物来支援轻工业更大规模的发展，满足城市人民生活的日益提高的需要。
