    The Fragrance of Polish Soil
    ——Listening to Pianist Jan Ekier's Chopin Recital
    Hong Shijun
    To commemorate the 150th anniversary of the birth of Chopin, the singer of the 19th-century Polish people and a world cultural celebrity, the Polish people have sent their excellent pianist, Jan Ekier, to China to participate in commemorative performances and hold Chopin recitals, which is truly exciting. We wish his performances a success.
    Chopin is one of the foreign composers with the broadest audience base in our country, and his works are often performed by our pianists. As the great Polish poet Norwid pointed out, "By nationality, he is Polish; by musical genius, he is a citizen of the world...", Comrade Ekier's successful performance will better help us to correctly understand Chopin's works.
    The overall impression of pianist Ekier's playing is that it is simple, rigorous, refined, and restrained; the tone is bright and delicate, the dynamics are implicit, the touch is light, without rendering personal improvisational emotional exaggeration, but focusing on revealing Chopin's folk simplicity and classical rational elements. In terms of dramatic passion, especially in the Ballades, many places seem to hold back as if afraid of going too far; in terms of infectiousness, it is completely different from the affected and vulgar sentimentality of some Western European pianists who are keen on personal exaggeration.
    The program arrangement of the recital, the genres of Polish folk dances (four Polonaises, four Mazurkas, five Waltzes) account for the largest proportion, which is also thought-provoking. Therefore, the entire concert is filled with the life atmosphere of Polish folk life and the fragrance of Polish soil; the exquisite and transparent melody set off by the distinct folk dance rhythms is like the sparkling morning dew sprinkled on flowers and plants, giving people a refreshing feeling.
    Jan Ekier is an outstanding Polish pianist. In 1937, he participated in the Third International Chopin Piano Competition and won an honorary diploma. During the German fascist occupation, he mainly engaged in educational work. After the victory, he began his artistic life again. Due to his contribution to musical life, the Polish Council of Ministers awarded him the Gold Cross of Merit in 1955. Ekier's performance enables us to have a correct understanding of Polish musical culture and national psychological qualities; this will have an important impact on enhancing the brotherly friendship between China and Poland and strengthening cultural exchanges and mutual understanding between the two countries.

    波兰泥土的芬芳
    ——听钢琴家扬·贝莱仁斯基萧邦作品独奏会
    洪士銈
    波兰人民为了和我国人民一起纪念世界文化名人、十九世纪波兰人民的歌手——萧邦诞生一百五十周年，派出了自己优秀的钢琴家扬·贝莱仁斯基来我国参加纪念性的演出活动，举行萧邦作品独奏会，真是令人兴奋。我们预祝他的演出获得成功。
    萧邦是我国拥有最广大群众欣赏基础的外国作曲家之一，他的作品经常是我国钢琴家演奏的节目。正如波兰伟大诗人诺尔维德所指出的：“论国籍，他是波兰人；论音乐天才，他是全世界的公民……”，这次贝莱仁斯基同志的成功演出，更是很好地帮助我们正确了解萧邦的作品。
    钢琴家贝莱仁斯基的演奏特点，给我们总的印象是纯朴、严谨、洗炼而有节制；音色明亮精致，力度含蓄，触键轻盈，不渲染个人即兴式的感情夸张，而着重于揭示萧邦的民间朴素的一面和古典主义的理性因素。在戏剧性的激情方面，特别在叙事曲中，好些地方欲纵故擒好像是恐怕失之过猛；在感染力方面，完全不同于西欧某些钢琴家那种矫揉做作、热中于个人夸张的俚俗情调。
    独奏会的节目编排，波兰民间舞曲的体裁（四首波兰舞曲、四首玛祖卡舞曲、五首圆舞曲）占最大比重，这也是耐人寻味的事。所以，整个音乐会洋溢着波兰民间的生活气息所散发出的波兰泥土的芬芳；由鲜明的民间舞蹈节奏烘托出的精致透明旋律，像洒在花草上的晶莹朝露，给人以清新的感觉。
    扬·贝莱仁斯基是波兰的杰出的钢琴家。1937年，他参加第三届国际萧邦钢琴比赛，获得荣誉奖状。在德国法西斯侵占时期，他主要从事教育工作。胜利以后，又开始了艺术生活。由于他对音乐生活的贡献，1955年波兰部长会议授给他金质十字勋章。贝莱仁斯基的演奏，使我们对于波兰的音乐文化和民族心理素质有了正确的理解；这对于增进中波兄弟般的友谊和加强两国间的文化交流与相互了解，将会起重要的影响。
