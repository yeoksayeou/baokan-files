Xinhua News Agency, April 20th, Kuala Lumpur Dispatch: Former Deputy Chairman of the Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party, Paran, began a hunger strike on the 18th at the Muar Detention Camp in Johor, protesting the Federation's "Emergency Regulations Case Review Committee's" refusal of his request to go to Britain to study law.

    At the same time, other political prisoners in the Muar Detention Camp also announced a work stoppage to support Paran's hunger strike.

    Federation parliamentarian David issued a statement on the same day, strongly condemning the government's practice of detaining Paran for twelve years without a public trial.

    He said that this was an "uncivilized" practice and a "mockery of human fairness."

    Paran was detained when the "Emergency Regulations" came into effect in 1948. In April of last year, his case was submitted to the "Emergency Regulations Case Review Committee" for review. He applied to study law in the United Kingdom, but the authorities have unreasonably refused his request.

    绝食抗议政府的非法拘留
    麻坡拘留营其他政治犯支持巴兰的绝食斗争
    新华社20日讯　吉隆坡消息：前任马来亚共产党中央委员会副主席巴兰18日开始在柔佛州麻坡拘留营实行绝食，抗议联合邦“紧急法令案件审议委员会”拒绝他申请前往英国研究法律的要求。
    与此同时，麻坡拘留营里的其他政治犯也宣布停止工作，以支持巴兰的绝食斗争。
    联合邦议员戴维在同一天发表声明，强烈指责政府将巴兰扣留达十二年之久而不进行公开审讯的做法。
    他说，这是一种“不文明”的做法，是“对人类公平的一种讽刺”。
    巴兰是在1948年“紧急法令”开始实施的时候被拘留的。去年4月，他的案件曾被提交“紧急法令案件审议委员会”审议。他申请到英国研究法律，但是当局一直无理地拒绝他的要求。
