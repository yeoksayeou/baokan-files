Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: All departments in Shandong Province, including industry, finance and trade, transportation, science, health, and schools, have taken active steps to launch a comprehensive upsurge in support of agriculture.

Since the beginning of this year, more than 120,000 technicians and workers from factories and mines in various places have formed mobile repair teams, repairing more than 2.7 million pieces of various spring sowing and transportation tools, waterwheels, and other irrigation and drainage machinery for the people's communes. They have basically ensured that all agricultural machinery and equipment are inspected and repaired once. Workers remaining in the factories put forward the slogan of "reducing personnel without reducing production," and launched competitions with workers going to the countryside, vigorously carrying out technical innovations and comprehensively overfulfilling the first quarter's production tasks of irrigation and drainage power machinery, water pumps, chemical fertilizers, and so on. Employees of commercial departments have supplied twice as much irrigation and drainage machinery this year compared to the same period last year. Employees of transportation departments have implemented day and night double-shift transportation, ensuring that spring plowing and drought resistance materials are transported as soon as they arrive. The postal and telecommunications system has dispatched mobile service personnel to deliver packages and money orders to people's doors, without delaying members' production. They also closely combined with the spring plowing and drought resistance movement, rushing to erect telephone lines, so that where the leadership goes, postal and telecommunications services follow. The health department has organized more than 80,000 medical personnel to conduct mobile medical services and safety and hygiene publicity activities in the fields and construction sites, strengthening the prevention of various diseases and ensuring the health of the drought resistance army.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: In Guangdong Province, industrial support for agriculture has gradually developed from sporadic and rush support in the past to comprehensive and regular support; from the actions of a few people and a few units to the actions of most people and most units.

Since the end of last year, according to the nature and scale of their enterprises, factories and mines in Shaoguan City have respectively established fixed cooperative relationships with the thirteen people's communes in the suburbs of the city. These factories and mines have all formulated plans to support the communes. Up to now, they have successively supplied the people's communes with more than 790 sets of mechanical equipment, more than 140,000 large and small farm tools, and more than 2,800 tons of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

With the strong support of the industrial sector, many counties in Guangdong Province have now initially established agricultural machinery manufacturing and maintenance networks, achieving the goal of having a machinery factory in each county, an agricultural machinery factory in each commune, and an agricultural tool and machinery repair station in each brigade.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: More than 6,300 technical workers from various industrial enterprises in Gansu Province have successively formed 397 technical service teams, which have been dispatched to people's communes and key water conservancy construction sites throughout the province to help rush repairs of irrigation and drainage machinery and farming equipment, install new mechanical equipment, impart technology, and support agricultural technology transformation and the drought resistance and spring plowing production movement.

After arriving at various places, these technical service teams, under the leadership of the local Party committees, closely cooperated with the county and commune industrial departments. Based on the current urgent needs of drought resistance and spring sowing, they first concentrated their efforts on rushing to repair irrigation and drainage water lifting machinery. According to incomplete statistics as of March 25, they had repaired more than 294,000 sets (pieces) of various irrigation and drainage machinery, more than 98,000 various transport vehicles, and more than 101,000 farm tools.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot: The industrial departments of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have launched a mass movement to support agricultural and animal husbandry production.

Before the start of large-scale spring plowing and sowing and the irrigation of farmland and feed bases, more than 8,000 agricultural and animal husbandry machinery factories, general machinery factories, and fertilizer factories throughout the autonomous region rushed to produce a large number of agricultural and animal husbandry production machines and chemical fertilizers for farmers and herdsmen. In the first quarter of this year alone, the total weight of various machines manufactured by various factories for agricultural and animal husbandry reached more than 5,600 tons, an increase of 3.2 times over the same period last year. These included machines and small farm tools for spring plowing and sowing, summer hoeing, animal husbandry, irrigation and drainage, transportation, and agricultural and animal husbandry byproduct processing. In addition, various factories also transferred more than 10,000 skilled workers to go deep into the countryside and pastoral areas to help farmers and herdsmen repair and assemble more than 160,000 sets (pieces) of machinery in a timely manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: Tianjin's industrial support for agriculture has developed from a crash production to regular production, from temporary arrangements to long-term deployments, and from a few factories to a large-scale mass movement. The city's industrial front has used crash production methods to produce 2,530 sets (sets) of equipment for the Yuecheng Reservoir in Hebei Province, with a total weight of more than 22,000 tons. In addition, it has produced more than 6,100 gas engines, gasoline engines, diesel engines, etc., more than 1 million parts for automobiles, tractors, and internal combustion machinery, as well as a large number of tractors, spring plowing machinery, etc., which have powerfully supported the construction of water conservancy, drought resistance, and spring plowing in the vast rural areas. At present, more than 200 factories have made long-term arrangements for future production based on Tianjin's plan to support agricultural technology transformation. They have adopted the method of large factories leading small factories and strong factories supporting weak factories, dividing areas and contracting to the end, improving the technical and management level of county and commune industries, training technical personnel, and enabling county and commune industries to rapidly move towards manufacturing and repairing more complex agricultural machinery.

In order to support agricultural technology transformation in a planned way, Tianjin is gradually establishing and improving an agricultural machinery manufacturing industrial system, and the standardization and serialization of agricultural machinery has gradually taken shape.

    支援农业厂厂有份人人有责
    山东、广东、甘肃、内蒙古、天津等地掀起支援农业的群众运动
    据新华社济南电　山东省工业、财贸、交通运输、科学、卫生、学校各部门都积极行动起来，掀起了全面支援农业的热潮。
    今年以来，各地厂矿的十二万多名技术工人组成流动修配组，到人民公社修理了二百七十多万件各种春播、运输工具和水车等排灌机械，基本上做到了所有农业机械设备都检修一遍。留在工厂的职工提出“减人不减产”的口号，与深入农村的工人开展竞赛，大闹技术革新，全面超额完成了第一季度的排灌动力机械、水泵、化肥等生产任务。商业部门职工今年以来供应的排灌机械比去年同期增长了两倍。交通运输部门的职工实行昼夜双班运输，对春耕和抗旱物资作到随到随运。邮电系统派出流动服务人员把包裹汇票送上门，不误社员生产。他们还与春耕、抗旱运动紧密结合，抢架电话线路，做到领导到那里，邮电服务就跟到那里。卫生部门组织了八万多名医务人员，到田间、工地进行巡回医疗和安全卫生的宣传活动，加强各种疾病的预防，保证了抗旱大军的健康。
    据新华社广州电　广东省工业支援农业已从过去零星突击的支援，逐渐发展成为全面、经常的支援；从少数人和少数单位的行动，逐步发展成为多数人多数单位的行动。
    韶关市各厂矿根据本企业的性质、规模等情况，从去年年底以来，已分别同市郊十三个人民公社挂钩，建立了固定的协作关系。这些厂矿都制定了支援公社的计划。到目前为止，他们已先后供给人民公社七百九十多台机械设备，十四万多件大、小农具，二千八百多吨化学肥料和农药。
    在工业部门的大力支援下，目前广东省已有不少县初步建立起农业机械制造维修网，做到了县有机械厂、社有农械厂、大队有农具机械修配站。
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃省各工业企业陆续派出各种技术工人六千三百多名，组成三百九十七个技术服务队，分赴全省各地人民公社和重点水利工地，帮助突击修理排灌机械和耕作机具，安装新的机械设备，传授技术，支援农业技术改造和抗旱、春耕生产运动。
    这些技术服务队到达各地后，在当地党委的领导下，密切配合县社工业部门，根据当前抗旱和春播的紧迫需要，首先集中力量抢修排灌提水机械。截至3月25日的不完全统计，他们已修理好各种排灌机械二十九万四千多台（件），各种运输车辆九万八千多辆，农具十万一千多件。
    据新华社呼和浩特电　内蒙古自治区各工业部门掀起了支援农牧业生产的群众运动。
    在大规模的春耕播种和农田、饲料基地的灌溉开始以前，遍布自治区各地的八千多个农牧业机械厂、通用机械厂和化肥厂，就为农牧民赶制出大量农牧业生产机具和化肥。各工厂仅在今年第一季度为农牧业制造的各种机具的总重量就达五千六百多吨，比去年同期增长了三点二倍。其中包括春耕播种、夏锄、畜牧业、排灌、运输、农牧业副产品加工等方面用的机具和小农具。此外，各工厂还抽调一万多名能工巧匠，深入农村、牧区，及时帮助农牧民修配了十六万多台（件）机具。
    据新华社天津电　天津市工业支援农业的活动已由突击生产发展到经常性生产，由临时安排发展到长远部署，由少数工厂发展到大规模的群众运动。全市工业战线已用突击生产的方法，为河北省岳城水库生产了二千五百三十台（套）设备，总重量达二万二千多吨。另外还生产了煤气机、汽油机、柴油机等六千一百多台，汽车、拖拉机、内燃机械的配件一百多万件，以及大批拖拉机、春耕机械等，有力地支援了广大农村水利建设、抗旱和春耕。目前已有二百多家工厂根据天津市支援农业技术改造的规划，对今后的生产作了长期安排。他们采取以大带小，以强扶弱的办法，分片包干，一包到底，提高县、社工业技术和管理水平，培养训练技术人员，使县、社工业迅速向制造和修配较复杂的农业机械迈进。
    为了有计划地支援农业技术改造，天津市正逐步建立和健全农业机械制造工业体系，农业机械的成套化和系列化已经逐步形成。
