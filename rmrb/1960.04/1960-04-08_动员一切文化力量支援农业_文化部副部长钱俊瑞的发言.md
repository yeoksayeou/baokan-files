Mobilize All Cultural Forces to Support Agriculture
Speech by Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture

Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian.

There is a passage in Comrade Li Fuchun's report that says: "In order to promote the rapid development of agriculture, all departments, including industry, transportation, commerce, finance, science, education, culture, and health, must regard supporting agriculture as their important task, and make specific arrangements for the work of their own departments in accordance with the requirements of this task." This passage is very important. I would like to talk here about the issue of cultural support for agriculture and better service to farmers.

To victoriously realize its historical mission, the proletariat must use all kinds of weapons, one of which is a very sharp weapon called culture and art. Revolutionary culture and art is a reflection of the new politics and the new economy, and in turn plays a great role in politics and economy. A good revolutionary song, such as the "March of the Volunteers," can awaken millions of people, rush to the revolutionary battlefield, kill the enemy and achieve results, or rush to the production front to conquer nature. Revolutionary literature, drama, movies, paintings, etc., all have such effects. Therefore, the proletariat firmly grasps this weapon, uses its ubiquitous, subtle, propaganda and mobilization strengths, and cooperates with other arms in the political and ideological fronts to achieve the purpose of eliminating the political and ideological influence of the feudal class and the bourgeoisie. Because of this, both Lenin and Mao Zedong regarded revolutionary literature and art as an indispensable part of the entire revolutionary cause, and demanded that revolutionary literature and art serve the people wholeheartedly, serve the workers, peasants and soldiers.

Now, one of the central tasks of our Party and the People's Government is to consolidate and develop the people's communes, strive for a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, and realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. Cultural work should do everything possible to serve this central task. Vice Premier Li Fuchun called on cultural workers in his report to "continue to work hard to develop mass cultural activities, especially rural cultural activities." This is the reason. This is an extremely glorious task that every cultural and artistic worker must consider and undertake.

The Ministry of Culture recently held an on-site meeting on rural cultural work in Shanxi to review the current situation of rural cultural work across the country, summarize experiences, and make specific arrangements for how to further develop rural cultural work in the future.

Our Party has always attached great importance to rural cultural work. During the long revolutionary war, the cultural work in the base areas was mainly rural cultural work, and the main targets were farmers and soldiers—armed farmers. This kind of cultural work played a huge role in coordinating politics, war, and agricultural production. Since the founding of the country, with the high tides of several rural revolutions, such as land reform, rural collectivization, and the people's commune movement, rural cultural work has greatly developed and achieved great results. Especially in the past two years, because of the three magic weapons of the socialist construction general line, people's communes, and the Great Leap Forward, rural cultural work has developed more rapidly, showing a vigorous, lively, and unprecedentedly popular and prosperous situation. This is mainly reflected in two aspects: On the one hand, the vast number of professional cultural and artistic workers have carried out extremely extensive and in-depth popularization work in rural areas in the past two years. They went down to the countryside and mountains in batches and shared labor and life with farmers. At the same time, they carried out the work of popularizing culture. Many professional writers and artists wrote many works, painted many paintings, composed many songs, and performed many dramas for farmers, reflecting new people and new things from all aspects, and were warmly welcomed by farmers. This literary and artistic team that has gone deep into the countryside is essentially an important political propaganda team sent by the Chinese working class to the countryside. Their task is to use various cultural and artistic tools to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, improve the communist consciousness of farmers, and promote the leap forward in agricultural production. At the same time, they also transformed and improved their own thinking, and increased a lot of practical knowledge and skills by participating in labor and combining with farmers. Therefore, some people say that the vast countryside is both a battlefield and a melting pot for cultural workers. This is true. On the other hand, driven by the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the people's commune movement, the cultural activities and artistic creation of the masses of farmers have appeared unprecedentedly active and prosperous throughout the country. Taking Xiyang and Linyi counties in Shanxi Province as examples, people's communes and management districts there have generally established Party schools, Communist Youth League schools, red and expert schools, cultural centers, cultural stations, exhibition rooms, libraries, amateur performing arts troupes (drama troupes), blackboard newspapers, amateur song and dance troupes, clapper talk teams, farmer creation groups or writing groups, reading groups, slide projection groups, radio stations, small newspapers, etc., forming a widespread and in-depth cultural propaganda network. They implement the policy of cultural service to politics and production, and carry out propaganda and education activities according to the central work of the Party in various periods. Their activities are closely combined with production and central work, and the activity forms are rich and colorful. The vast majority of farmers, men, women, old and young, participate in these activities. Now, no matter which village you walk into, it is truly a new situation of poetry and paintings covering the walls, songs all over the land, a hundred flowers blooming, and all the people rejoicing, feeling happy, and being lively. Farmers use such poems to praise their cultural activities. One poem writes that cultural work is "long legs entering the canteen, wings flying over the mountains, culture reaching the fields ten times (referring to ten kinds of cultural activities going deep into the fields), fragrant flowers for thousands of miles," and another says: "Culture moves to the mountains, molten iron rolls and flows into rivers; culture reaches the fields, crops grow so tall they break through the sky; culture enters the canteen, meals are varied and delicious." This is indeed the case.

The literature and art created by the masses themselves plays a great role in encouraging and uniting the masses and promoting production. Let's see how the farmers in Linyi sing praises of the general line, people's communes, and the Great Leap Forward:

"The general line, with golden light shining, illuminates the world,
Workers and farmers are all like immortals, commanding the wind and rain to move mountains and rivers,
Removing stars and changing the sun and moon, breaking the sky and digging the earth with hoes;
Iron dragons suck up the water of the Milky Way, opening up the moon palace to grow crops;
Moving down the Jade Emperor's Lingxiao Palace, moving the Yaochi to float fishing boats;
Wheat like sorghum bears thousands of ears, grain piles higher than the Kunlun Mountains;
Kongming and Luban come to learn from us, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl become commune members;
What the world has, we must have, what the world does not have, we must do;
The masters of heaven and earth are commune members, outstanding figures are today."
Let's look at how they sing praises of the enthusiasm for production:

"Stars in the sky, lights on the ground, the Shuangta Commune is making a big scene at the Huoshui Pit,
(Opening a Huoshui pond)
Thousands of troops and horses are dispatched together, scaring the Dragon King to tremble,
Hurriedly handing over the seal and bowing, saying that they will always listen to orders from now on,
Underground springs gush upwards, dry and alkaline beaches become fertile fields."
Let's look at how powerful a "Manure Delivery Song" is!

"Carrying, carrying, carrying, carrying, carrying until the sun sets,
Carrying until the moon hangs in the sky, carrying until the girls are sweating,
Carrying until the young men are wet with clothes, carrying until the manure piles are as high as mountains,
Carrying millions of tons of grain."
Look at how they criticize lazy people:

"No matter how clever your mouth is, no matter how wonderful your words are,
Even if you have a steel mouth and iron tongue,
You can't hide your lazy bones.
Your mouth is like rock candy, your words are sweet,
But your body is lazy and your butt is heavy, and your lazy name is spread everywhere."
Let's see how they criticize conservative thinking:

"Thousand catties of grain, ten thousand catties of grain,
Some people say that this target is too high and cannot be done.
It's not that it can't be done, it's that you are superstitious about old experience.
Our commune has a yield of five hundred and three (catties) per mu,
Is this a myth or a random rumor?!
It's just because you are conservative and dare not do it, like a small-footed woman who can't move forward.
We don't rely on the Dragon King, we don't rely on heaven, we rely on our brains and iron fists;
Brains come up with wisdom to turn mountains and rivers, iron fists break the dry plateau."

Comrades, look, these are a batch of creations by farmers in Shanxi, how bold, strong and witty! How impressive are their ambitions!

The above-mentioned situation of rural cultural activities in Xiyang and Linyi counties in Shanxi Province is not an isolated case, but exists in all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. This vigorous rural cultural activity throughout the country is undoubtedly very beneficial to consolidating and developing the people's communes and further promoting production.

Now, China's socialist construction has entered a new historical period. Accelerating the development of agriculture and conscientiously implementing the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program are the central links in developing China's socialist economy at a high speed and in proportion. In order to achieve a continued and comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, it is necessary to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, further consolidate and develop the people's communes; it is necessary to carry out technical and cultural revolutions in rural areas in a vigorous manner. Adapting to this situation, cultural work must closely follow, fully support agriculture, and better serve farmers. We must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, comprehensively and correctly implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, more closely coordinate with political movements, coordinate with production struggles, coordinate with the popularization of education and health movements, adhere to the mass line, implement the combination of professional and amateur, the combination of popularization and improvement, do a good job in all literary and artistic propaganda and popularization of cultural and scientific knowledge, and push China's rural cultural work to a new stage of greater popularization and greater improvement.

In order to achieve this glorious task, I would like to emphasize three points here.

First, all professional cultural and artistic organizations and professional cultural and artistic workers should formulate specific plans for serving the countryside based on the policy of vigorously supporting agriculture and better serving farmers, and resolutely guarantee their completion.

Our film industry should vigorously develop scientific and educational films on agricultural technological innovation, and news documentaries reflecting the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the rapid changes in the face of the countryside, and the heroic and model deeds on the agricultural front. When making feature films, all film studios should pay attention to meeting the needs and acceptance of farmers, and try to make the story have a beginning and an end, the shots are clear, not too fast, and not too many decorations, so that farmers can understand. It is necessary to develop rural film projection teams, and gradually ensure that each people's commune has a projection team. Projectionists should strengthen the explanation of the film in a form that farmers like to see and hear, so that each projection team is an excellent propaganda team.

Our publishing work should timely supply textbooks for rural primary schools, agricultural middle schools, literacy campaigns, and farmer's spare-time schools, and supply popular readings suitable for the level of literacy graduates. Central-level publishing houses and local publishing houses should cooperate to compile and print a set of popular workers' and peasants' library with phonetic alphabet annotations. It is necessary to greatly strengthen the publication of New Year pictures and comic strips aimed at farmers and rural children. It is necessary to strengthen the editing work of newspapers in special districts and counties. It is necessary to vigorously strengthen the distribution of books and newspapers in rural areas, and require that popular books that coordinate with political movements and production can be delivered to rural areas in a timely manner, and ensure that the books delivered to rural areas can meet the needs of farmers.

Professional art troupes and literary and artistic workers should create programs and works that farmers like to see and hear, and conduct planned tours and exhibitions in rural areas. They should also take assisting farmers' amateur literary and artistic activities as their regular task.

Libraries and cultural centers at the county level should lend books suitable for farmers to read to people's communes in batches for circulation, and should provide business guidance to commune libraries. Museums and cultural centers in various places should plan to guide people's communes to hold various exhibitions.

Mass Art Centers and Cultural Centers are bases for guiding mass cultural and artistic activities. They should, without hindering production, take various measures to train farmer amateur cultural and artistic backbones, supply amateur learning and singing materials, and do a good job in guidance.

All our professional cultural and artistic workers must recognize their lofty responsibility. They are a powerful team sent by the working class to the countryside to support agriculture. We must serve farmers wholeheartedly, and train and improve ourselves in the service, so that we can gradually grow into a cultural team of our own working class that is 100%.

Second, further develop farmers' amateur cultural and artistic activities. The organizational forms and activity methods of farmers' amateur cultural activities should be diverse, adapted to local conditions and times. In addition to other activities, we must currently do a good job in running commune performing arts troupes, rural exhibition rooms, field head culture and canteen culture.

The commune performing arts troupe is a very important cultural propaganda tool, and it must adhere to the principle of amateurism and must not be separated from production. Those who participate in these performing arts troupes are all good young and middle-aged laborers, and the total number in the country is hundreds of thousands. If they are separated from production, it will cause great losses to agricultural production. In this way, culture is not serving production, but going in the opposite direction and hindering production. Therefore, the commune performing arts troupe must not be separated from production. As for whether the members of the performing arts troupe are concentrated or dispersed, it can be adapted to local conditions. It is necessary to strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership over amateur performing arts troupes. It is necessary to establish the backbone role of poor and lower-middle peasants in amateur performing arts troupes under the leadership of the Party. Every member of the performing arts troupe must strive to be a "five-good" member, that is, good in political thought, good in production labor, good in cultural theory learning, good in contact with the masses, and good in literary and artistic activities. At present, performing arts troupes whose members have been concentrated must strengthen ideological education to prevent being separated from production or semi-separated from production; performing arts troupes whose members are scattered should pay attention to frequent activities and pay attention to improving the quality of activities. Whether concentrated or dispersed, attention should be paid to their cultural learning, and plans should be made to strive for all members to reach the middle school level within three to five years.

Rural exhibition halls (rooms) are an important way for the Party to conduct political education, science and technology, and cultural education to the masses of farmers, and they play a great role. The most common type of exhibition is the "Contrast Between the Past and the Present" exhibition. In some places, it has been developed into a "Three Ten Years" (ten years before liberation, ten years after the founding of the country, and ten years of long-term vision) exhibition. After seeing it, the masses said: "Thinking about the past, tears don't stop, looking at the present, smiling faces, looking forward to the future, feeling happy." This kind of exhibition is a very good revolutionary education, and it can be held everywhere. The content of various exhibitions should strive to combine production and central work; the methods should pay attention to the combination of regular and temporary exhibitions, the combination of comprehensive and special exhibitions, and the combination of fixed and mobile exhibitions, and focus on small and diverse exhibitions. Attention should be paid to running exhibitions diligently and thriftily to prevent extravagance and waste and formalism. Farmers and urban residents and school teachers and students should be organized to visit these exhibitions in a planned way to educate them.

Field head culture is a new development to adapt to the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, the great revolution in farmland, and the great development of high-yield fields. Its characteristic is that it goes deep into the front line of production and directly serves production. Shanxi's rural cultural "ten to the fields" has diverse forms and rich content, and should be promoted. With the popularization and development of high-yield fields, cultural activities should have more complete organizational forms, and strengthen the planning and flexibility of field head activities, and pay attention to improving quality.

Canteen culture is the product of the rural people's commune movement. It uses the houses and equipment of public canteens to set up various cultural propaganda and education places, such as exhibition rooms, libraries, cultural rooms, and red and expert classrooms, to carry out propaganda and mobilization to the masses, and systematic political and ideological education, and carry out cultural learning and cultural entertainment activities. In this way, public canteens are not only the concentrated living places for commune members, but also the concentrated cultural propaganda and education places, so that "politics and culture enter the canteen, and production and life are done well." Canteen cultural activities should be small and diverse, simple and economical, and prevent extravagance.

Now the face of the countryside is changing rapidly. With the gradual realization of agricultural modernization and the gradual establishment of new residential areas, the production organization forms and lifestyles of the countryside will continue to have new developments and changes. Rural cultural work should adapt to these developments and changes, and change its organizational forms and activity methods in a timely and active manner, enrich the content of activities, and make it more effective in serving production.

To make rural mass cultural activities persist and develop, there must be a strong amateur cultural and artistic team. Experience has proved that with such a team, rural cultural activities can persist in depth and improvement, and will not be dispersed by thunder. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously grasp the training and improvement of amateur literary and artistic backbones. The methods of training and improvement can be diverse, mainly communes running amateur training classes, counties running short-term training classes, and at the same time holding lectures, experience exchange meetings, poetry contests, art galleries, etc., prescribing the right medicine and teaching students according to their aptitude. The source of teachers should be local materials, and those who are capable can be teachers.

Third, continue to vigorously develop and improve farmer amateur literary and artistic creation.

The vast number of farmers, in the commune movement, in the Great Leap Forward in production, strongly demanded to express the brand-new era and brand-new characters. And they did do that. This is a matter of great historical significance. This is the germination of the great communist literature and art that will overcome all non-proletarian literature and art in the future. It seems that our worker-peasant writers have already embarked on their own creative path under the leadership and care of the Party in recent years. From our discussion with some excellent farmer literary and artistic creators in Shanxi, the path they have opened up is correct and healthy. Its characteristics are as follows: (1) The purpose of their creation, in the words of the farmer painter Gao Maohai, is "There are so many new people and new things, I want to paint them and make everyone happy." Or as the farmer author Li Jisheng said, "The Party's thoughts and Party's policies are bright lights, and it's right to write whatever the Party tells you to write." Farmer writer Li Jupeng said, "Why do I create? It is to promote the Party's policies and solve the ideological problems of the masses." They have no intention of personal fame or gain. (2) The content of their creation is closely coordinated with production and politics, which can not only reflect reality, but also dare to think and say, have lofty ideals, and conform to the principle of combining revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism. (3) They work and create at the same time, and never break away from production. They say, "Amateur creation is really exciting, you can't write without labor." (4) Rely on the masses for creation and constantly modify. A poem, a painting, a song, they have to sing and watch for the masses many times, and go through many revisions. Farmer composer Shi Zhangyuan said, "It's only when the masses love to sing it that it becomes a success." (5) Work hard and practice hard. They use hard work to learn politics and learn literary and artistic knowledge. When the farmer painter Gao Maohai first painted, he couldn't tell the difference between men and women. He asked his wife to sit by the wall in the evening, illuminate the wall with lights, and trace her shadow, slowly groping for the way. The farmer poet Li Xiwu lay in bed at night, pondering a few lines of poetry, and couldn't think of it. He forgot everything and didn't even know that the quilt was burned through by the fire. They learn from old artists, learn from new literary and artistic workers, but there is innovation and transformation, "putting everything to use on their own knife edge." (6) Drive the masses to create together. They drive others to write and paint, help them revise, and thus improve themselves. It seems that such a creative path for farmer writers is a broad road that every revolutionary literary and artistic creator should take.

The development of farmer amateur literary and artistic creation and amateur literary and artistic activities must strictly abide by the principle of mass needs and willingness, do not rigidly stipulate tasks, and do not force the masses to do things they are unwilling to do and will not do, otherwise it will hurt the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and even hinder production. We must pay close attention to this.

Farmer amateur literary and artistic creation should continue to develop greatly, improve greatly, and should develop and improve along the above-mentioned path. It is necessary to organize wall newspapers, poetry contest platforms, art galleries, and work exhibition work to promote mass creation. Professional literary and artistic workers should be willing to put in great effort to guide them, gradually improve their creative level, and learn from them at the same time. It is necessary to strengthen the collection, sorting and compilation and publication of mass creations. The close combination of professional literary and artistic workers and mass amateur authors is an important way to create socialist and communist literature and art.

Fellow delegates, taking agriculture as the foundation and supporting agriculture in everything is a great call from the Party and the government. Rural cultural work is an indispensable fighting weapon for the Party in rural areas to realize the above-mentioned great call, and it is also an important component of China's socialist and communist new culture. The great creation of 500 million farmers in culture and art is the most important source for building China's socialist and communist new culture. We must hold higher the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, mobilize all cultural and artistic forces to support agriculture, and strive to achieve greater popularization and continuous improvement of rural cultural and artistic work.

专栏：

    动员一切文化力量支援农业
    文化部副部长钱俊瑞的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告。
    李富春同志的报告有这样一段话：“为了促进农业的迅速发展，工业、运输、商业、金融、科学、教育、文化、卫生等各个部门，都要把支援农业当做自己的重要任务，并且适应这个任务的要求，具体安排本部门的工作。”这段话很重要。我在这里就想谈谈文化支援农业和更好地为农民服务的问题。
    无产阶级要胜利地实现它的历史任务，一定要运用各种各样的武器，其中有一种很锐利的武器就叫作文化艺术。革命的文化艺术是新政治和新经济的反映，而又反过来对政治和经济起伟大的作用。一首好的革命歌曲，比如说“义勇军进行曲”吧，能够唤起千百万群众，奔赴革命战场，杀敌致果，或者冲上生产战线，降龙伏虎。革命的文学、戏剧、电影、绘画等等，无不具有这样的作用。所以无产阶级就牢牢地抓住这把武器，利用它的无孔不入，潜移默化，宣传鼓动的长处，在政治战线和思想战线上，配合其它兵种，达到肃清封建阶级和资产阶级政治影响和思想影响之目的。正因为这样，列宁和毛泽东
  同志都把革命文艺看作是整个革命事业不可缺少的一部分，要求革命的文艺要全心全意为人民服务，为工农兵服务。
    现在我们的党和人民政府的中心任务之一，就是要巩固和发展人民公社，力争农业的全面跃进，提前实现全国农业发展纲要。文化工作应该千方百计地为这个中心任务服务。李富春副总理在他的报告中号召文化工作者要“继续努力发展群众文化活动，特别是农村文化活动。”就是这个道理。这是每一个文化艺术工作者所必须考虑和担负的一项极其光荣的任务。
    中央文化部最近在山西召开了一次全国农村文化工作的现场会议，检查了当前全国农村文化工作的情况，总结了经验，并且就今后如何进一步开展农村文化工作作了具体的安排。
    我们党历来就很重视农村文化工作。在长期的革命战争中，根据地的文化工作主要就是农村文化工作，工作的对象主要就是农民和士兵——武装的农民。这种文化工作，在配合政治、配合战争、配合农业生产方面曾经发挥了巨大的作用。建国以来，随着土地改革、农村合作化和人民公社化几个农村革命的高潮，农村文化工作有了极大的发展，取得了很大的成绩。特别是两年来，因为有了社会主义建设总路线、人民公社和大跃进这三大法宝，农村文化工作更加有了飞跃的发展，出现了蓬蓬勃勃，生动活泼，空前大普及大繁荣的局面。这主要表现在两个方面：一方面，广大专业文化艺术工作者两年来对农村作了极为广泛和深入的普及工作。他们成批地下乡上山和农民同劳动、同生活。同时进行普及文化的工作，许多专业作家和艺术家，为农民写了许多作品，画了许多画，作了许多曲子，演了许多戏，从各个方面来反映新人新事，受到农民的热烈欢迎。这样一支深入农村的文艺队伍，实质上是我国工人阶级
  派到农村中去的一支重要的政治宣传队伍，他们的任务就是利用各种文化艺术工具，来进一步巩固工农联盟，提高农民的共产主义觉悟，促进农业生产的跃进。同时，他们又通过参加劳动，和农民结合，改造和提高自己的思想，增长了许多实际知识和技能。因此，有人说，广大农村对于文化工作者来说，既是战场，又是熔炉，这话是不错的。另一方面，在农业生产大跃进和人民公社化运动的推动下，农民群众的文化活动和文艺创作在全国范围内出现了空前活跃和繁荣的局面。以山西省的昔阳和临猗两
  个县为例，在那里公社和管理区普遍建立起党校、团校、红专学校、文化馆、文化站、展览室、图书室、业余文工团（剧团）、黑板报、业余歌舞团、快板队、农民创作组或编写团、
  读报组、幻灯放映组、广播站、小报等等，形
  成了一个普遍深入的文化宣传网。它们贯彻执行文化为政治、为生产服务的方针，根据党在各个时期的中心工作，进行宣传教育活动。它
  们的活动内容密切结合生产、结合中心工作，活动形式丰富多彩。极大部分农民，男女老少，都参加这些活动。现在无论走进那个村庄，真个是诗画满墙，歌声遍地，形成百花争艳，万民欢乐，心情舒畅，生动活泼的新局面。农民用这样的诗歌来赞美自己的文化活动。有一首诗写道：文化工作是“长腿进食堂，插翅飞山岗，文化十到田（指十种文化活动深入田间），千里百花香”，又一首说：“文化搬上山，铁水滚滚汇成川；文化到田间，庄稼长的顶破天；文化进食堂，饭菜样多味道鲜。”事实也真是这样。
    群众自己创作的文艺对鼓舞和团结群众，推动生产起着很大的作用。看临猗的农民怎样歌颂总路线、人民公社和大跃进吧：
    “总路线，金光闪，光芒万丈照人间，
    工农个个赛神仙，呼风唤雨移山川，
    摘掉星斗换日月，破天掘地凭钁铣；
    铁龙吸尽银河水，开辟月宫种庄田；
    搬下玉皇灵霄殿，移来瑶池漂鱼船；
    麦如高粱结千穗，粮堆高过昆仑山；
    孔明鲁班来投师，牛郎织女当社员；
    世上有的咱要有，世上没的咱要办；
    天地主人是社员，风流人物在今天。”再看他们怎样歌颂生产干劲：
    “天上星，地下灯，双塔社大闹活水坑，
                      （开活水池塘）
    千军万马齐出动，吓得龙王胆颤惊，
    急忙交印又鞠躬，连说今后永远听命令，
    地下清泉往上冒，旱地碱滩变成良田耕。”再看一首“送粪歌”多么有劲！
    “担呀担，担呀担，担的太阳落了山，
    担的月亮挂天边，担的姑娘满头汗，
    担的小伙湿衣衫，担的粪堆高如山，
    担的粮食千万担。”你看他们怎样批评懒汉：
    “不管你嘴儿再巧，不管你话儿再妙，
    那怕你钢嘴铁舌头，
    也遮不住你那副懒骨头。
    嘴儿像冰糖，话儿句句香，
    只是身懒屁股重，懒汉臭名传四方。”再看他们怎么批评保守思想：
    “千斤粮，万斤粮，
    有人说这指标太高没法办。
    不是没法办，是你迷信老经验。
    咱社就有亩产五百三（斤），
    难道这是神话胡乱传？！
    只因你保守不敢干，小脚婆娘难向前。
    咱们不靠龙王不靠天，靠得脑瓜和铁拳；
    脑瓜出智水翻山，铁拳砸破旱高原。”
    同志们看吧，这些就是一批山西农民的创作，多么豪迈、刚健和机智呀！他们的雄心壮志又多么可观呀！
    上述山西省昔阳、临猗两县农村文化活动的情况，并不是个别的，在全国各省、市、自治区都有。这种遍及全国的蓬蓬勃勃的农村文化活动，对于巩固和发展人民公社，进一步促进生产，无疑是十分有利的。
    现在，我国的社会主义建设已经进入了一个新的历史时期。加速农业的发展，认真地贯彻实行发展农业纲要四十条，是高速度、按比例地发展我国社会主义经济的中心环节。为要实现农业的继续全面跃进，必须进一步巩固工农联盟，进一步巩固和发展人民公社；必须在农村中轰轰烈烈地开展技术革命和文化革命。适应这种形势，文化工作必须紧紧跟上，全力支援农业，更好地为农民服务。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，全面地、正确地贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，更加密切地配合政治运动，配合生产斗争，配合普及教育和卫生运动，坚持群众路线，实行专业与业余相结合，普及与提高相结合，做好一切文艺宣传和文化科学知识普及工作，把我国农村文化工作推向更加普及和更加提高的新阶段。
    为了实现这个光荣的任务，我想在这里着重讲三点意见。
    一、所有专业文化艺术团体和专业文化艺术工作者，都应当根据大力支援农业，更好地为农民服务的方针，订出为农村服务的具体计划，坚决保证完成。
    我们的电影事业，要大力发展有关农业技术革新方面的科学教育片，和反映农业大跃进、农村面貌迅速改变、农业战线上英雄模范事迹等题材的新闻纪录片。各电影制片厂在摄制故事片时，都应当注意适合农民的需要和接受力，尽量做到故事有始有末，镜头清清楚楚，不可太快，也不要太多插花，让农民看懂。要发展农村电影放映队，逐步做到每个人民公社有一个放映队。放映队员要用农民喜闻乐见的形式加强影片的说明工作，做到每个放映队都是一个出色的宣传队。
    我们的出版工作，要及时地供应农村小学、农业中学、扫盲、农民业余学校的课本，供应适合扫盲毕业程度的通俗读物。中央一级出版社和地方出版社要进行协作，编印一套有拼音字母注音的工农通俗文库。要大大加强以农民和农村少年儿童为对象的年画、连环画的出版工作。要加强专区和县的报纸编辑工作。要大力加强对农村的书报发行工作，要求做到配合政治运动和生产的通俗图书能够及时发到农村，并且做到发到农村的图书都能适合农民的需要。
    专业艺术团体和文艺工作者要创作农民喜闻乐见的节目和作品，有计划地深入农村进行巡回演出和展览。他们还应把辅助农民业余文艺活动作为自己的经常任务。
    县一级的图书馆和文化馆应该把适合农民阅读的图书分批借给人民公社传阅，并且要对公社图书室进行业务辅导。各地的博物馆和文化馆都应该有计划地辅导人民公社举办各种展览。
    群众艺术馆和文化馆是辅导群众文化艺术活动的基地。它们应该在不妨碍生产的原则下，采取各种办法，培训农民业余文化艺术骨干，供应业余学习和演唱材料，做好辅导工作。
    我们一切专业文化艺术工作者都要认识自己的崇高责任。他们是被工人阶级派去农村支援农业的一支有力的队伍。我们必须全心全意地为农民服务，并且在服务中锻炼和提高自己，使自己逐步地成长为百分之百的工人阶级自己的文化队伍。
    二、进一步开展农民业余文化艺术活动。农民业余文化活动的组织形式和活动方式要多种多样，因地因时制宜。除其它各项活动外，当前我们特别要把公社文工团、农村展览室、田头文化和食堂文化办好。
    公社文工团是很重要的文化宣传工具，它必须坚持业余的原则，决不能脱离生产。参加这些文工团的都是些青壮年好劳动力，全国合起来算，就要上百万人，如果他们脱离生产，那对农业生产就会造成很大的损失。这样，文化便不是服务生产，而是走向它的反面，是妨碍生产了。因此公社文工团决不能脱产。至于文工团的成员是集中还是分散，那就可以因地制宜。要加强党对业余文工团的政治思想领导。一定要树立在党的领导下的贫农、下中农在业余文工团里的骨干作用。每个文工团员都必须努力做“五好”团员，即政治思想好、生产劳动好、文化理论学习好、联系群众好、文艺活动好。目前成员已集中的文工团，要加强思想教育，防止脱产或半脱产；成员分散的文工团，要注意经常的活动，注意提高活动的质量。无论集中或分散，都要注意他们的文化学习，要订出规划，争取在三五年内全体团员都达到中学水平。
    农村展览馆（室）是党向农民群众进行政治教育、科学技术、文化教育的重要方式，作用很大。最普遍的一种展览是“今昔对比”展览。有些地方，把它发展成为“三个十年”（解放前十年、建国十年、十年远景）展览。群众看后说：“想过去流泪不止，看现在笑容满面，望将来心情舒畅。”这种展览是一种很好的革命教育，各地可以都办。各种展览的内容上应力求结合生产和中心工作；方式方法要注意经常性的和临时性的展览相结合，综合性的和专题的展览相结合，固定的和流动的展览相结合，而以小型多样为主。要注意勤俭办展览，防止铺张浪费、搞形式主义。要有计划地组织农民以及城市居民、学校师生去参观这些展览，让他们受到教育。
    田头文化是适应生产大跃进、农田大革命、大搞丰产方这些新形势的一种新发展。它的特点是深入生产前沿，直接为生产服务。山西农村文化的“十到田”，形式多样，内容丰富，应该推广。随着丰产方的普及和发展，文化活动要有更加完备的组织形式，并且加强田头活动的计划性和灵活性，注意提高质量。
    食堂文化是农村人民公社化后的产物。它利用公共食堂的房屋设备，布置各种文化宣传教育场所，如展览室、图书室、文娱室和红专教室等，向群众进行宣传鼓动，和系统的政治思想教育，开展文化学习和文化娱乐活动。这样公共食堂不但是社员集中的生活场所，同时又是集中的文化宣传教育场所，做到“政治文化进食堂，生产生活搞得强。”食堂文化活动应该小型多样，因陋就简，防止铺张。
    现在农村面貌日新月异，随着农业现代化的逐步实现，新的居民点的逐步建立，农村的生产组织形式和生活方式，将继续有新的发展和变化。农村文化工作，应该适应这些发展和变化，及时和主动地变更自己的组织形式和活动方法，充实活动内容，使它更有效地为生产服务。
    要使农村群众文化活动坚持和发展，必须有一支坚强的业余文化艺术队伍。经验证明，有了这样一支队伍，农村文化活动就能坚持深入和提高，就雷打不散。所以一定要大抓特抓业余文艺骨干的培养和提高工作。培养和提高的方法可以多种多样，主要是公社办业余训练班，县办短期轮训班，同时举办讲习会、经验交流会、赛诗会、画廊等等，对症下药，因材施教。教师来源应该就地取材，能者为师。
    三、继续大力发展和提高农民业余文艺创作。
    广大农民群众，在公社化运动中，在生产大跃进中，强烈地要求表现全新的时代和全新的人物。而他们的确是在那样作了。这是一件有重大历史意义的事情。这是在将来将要战胜一切非无产阶级文学艺术的伟大的共产主义文学艺术的萌芽。看来，我们的工农作家几年来已经在党的领导和关怀下，踏出了自己的创作道路。从我们在山西和一批优秀的农民文艺作者座谈来看，他们所开辟的道路是正确的、健康的。其特点如下：（一）他们创作的目的，用农民画家高毛孩的话来讲，就是“新人新事实在多，我就要画它们，让大家高兴。”或者像农民作者李济胜所说，“党的思想、党的政策是明灯，党叫写啥就写啥，这没错。”农民作家李居鹏说“我为啥创作？就是要宣传党的方针政策，解决群众的思想问题。”他们丝毫没有为着个人名利的念头。（二）他们创作的内容，密切配合生产、配合政治，既能反映现实，又是敢想敢说，有远大理想，符合革命浪漫主义和革命现实主义相结合的原则。（三）他们边劳动，边创作，决不脱离生产。他们说“业余创作真带劲，离了劳动写不成。”（四）依靠群众进行创作，不断修改。一首诗，一幅画，一个曲子，他们都要多次交群众唱、看，经过多次修改。农民作曲家史掌元说“要改到群众都爱唱了，才成。”（五）勤学苦练。他们用苦功夫，学政治，学文艺知识。农民画家高毛孩最初画画，分不出男的和女的，他就要他的老婆在晚上抽空坐在墙边，用灯光照着墙，  描摹她的影子，慢慢摸到门径。农民诗人李希文夜里躺在床上捉摸几句诗，苦思不得，什么都忘了，弄得被子被火烧穿也不知道。他们向老艺人学，向新文艺工作者学，但是有革新，有改造，“把一切用到自己的刀口上。”（六）带动群众一起创作。他们带动别人写、画，帮他们修改，从而也提高自己。看来，农民作家们这样一条创作道路是每个革命文艺创作者所应该走的康庄大道。
    发展农民业余文艺创作和业余文艺活动都必须严格遵守群众需要和自愿的原则，不要硬性规定任务，不要勉强叫群众做他们不愿做、不会做的事情，否则就会伤害群众的积极性和创造性，甚至妨碍生产。这一点我们要十分注意。
    农民业余文艺创作要继续大发展，大提高，而且要沿着上述的道路去发展和提高。要很好地组织墙报、赛诗台、画廊和作品展览工作，来推动群众的创作。专业文艺工作者要舍得用大功夫来辅导他们，逐步提高他们的创作水平，同时向他们学习。要加强对群众创作的收集、整理和编选出版的工作。专业文艺工作者和群众业余作者的密切结合，是创造社会主义、共产主义文学艺术的重要途径。
    各位代表，以农业为基础，一切支援农业，这是党和政府的伟大号召。农村文化工作，是党在农村中为了实现上述伟大号召的一个必不可少的战斗武器，也是我国社会主义、共产主义新文化的一个重要的组成部分。五亿农民在文化艺术方面的伟大创造，是建设我国社会主义、共产主义新文化的最主要的源泉。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，动员一切文化艺术力量支援农业，为实现农村文化艺术工作的更加普及和不断提高而奋勇前进。
