Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 28th - The Vietnamese newspaper "People's Daily" published an article today exposing the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's extraordinary panic in the face of the rising tide of struggle by the South Korean people against the US-Rhee clique.

The article pointed out that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique initially remained silent about the South Korean people's struggle, until they felt they could no longer cover it up. Then, Saigon Radio cautiously broadcast some news, repeatedly echoing the deceptive statements of the US-Rhee clique in an attempt to defend it.

The article pointed out that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique had tried its best to praise Syngman Rhee's dictatorial rule, portraying Rhee, the old US lackey in South Korea, as a "hero," an "Asian freedom fighter," and so on. They also propagated that the "Republic of Vietnam" and Syngman Rhee's "Republic of Korea" had many "common points."

The article pointed out that the South Korean people's struggle movement against the US-Rhee clique shattered the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's deceptive rhetoric and dealt them a head-on blow.

The article pointed out that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is very afraid that the situation in South Korea will cause panic among their subordinates, making them even more isolated.

    同是反动派　唯恐共命运
    李承晚垮台　吴庭艳丧胆
    新华社河内28日电　越南“人民报”今天发表的一篇文章揭露，吴庭艳集团对南朝鲜人民反对美李集团的日益高涨的斗争浪潮表现出异常的惊慌。
    文章指出，吴庭艳集团对南朝鲜人民的斗争起初一直默不作声，直到他们认为已经掩盖不住了，西贡广播电台才异常谨慎地发表一些消息，一次又一次地重复美李集团的欺骗性的声明，企图为美李集团辩护。
    文章指出，吴庭艳集团曾经竭力吹捧李承晚的独裁统治，把美国在南朝鲜的老走狗李承晚描绘成“英雄”，“亚洲的自由战士”等。并宣传什么“越南共和国”同李承晚的“大韩民国”有许多“共同点”。
    文章指出，南朝鲜人民的反对美李集团的斗争运动，粉碎了吴庭艳集团的骗人论调，给了吴庭艳集团以当头棒击。
    文章指出，吴庭艳集团非常害怕南朝鲜的情况将会引起他们的手下的惊慌失措，使他们更加陷于孤立。
