Comrades,

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee.

Agriculture Production, Successive Bumper Harvests

Our Shangsuan People's Commune in Jinning County, Yunnan Province, like the rest of the country, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, with all members holding high the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the three red banners of the People's Commune, exerting full effort, and overcoming various natural disasters, achieved continuous leaps forward on the agricultural front in 1959. The total grain output of the commune increased by 53% compared to 1958, with an average of 1,618 jin of grain per person. The total income from agriculture and sideline occupations reached 1.03 million yuan, an increase of 27% compared to 1958, averaging 125 yuan per person. The portion distributed to the members was 530,000 yuan, an increase of 28% compared to 1958, ensuring increased income for more than 90% of the members. The average income per member has exceeded the income of well-to-do peasants working individually by more than 50%, and grain exceeded three and a half times. The members sang loudly, "The general line is a bright light, shining brightly on Shangsuan, everyone implements the general line, and even yellow earth can be turned into gold." In the past two years, following the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the higher party committee, we have conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. First, we seized the urgent demands of the masses and launched a vigorous farmland water conservancy construction movement. We raised the original 22-meter-high dam of the Chaihe Reservoir by 5 meters, increasing the storage capacity by 9 million cubic meters. We also built a reservoir on a high mountain at an altitude of more than 2,500 meters, and dug two canals more than 20 li long on the mountainside, allowing the river water to pass through the high mountains and surround the mountainside, serving agricultural production obediently. When the water conservancy project began, an old man in his seventies said doubtfully, "You young lads shouldn't dream. You won't finish it even if you dig for a lifetime." However, the facts were beyond his expectations. It didn't take a lifetime; it was completed in just over forty days. He was deeply educated and said very moved, "The leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is really amazing. Things that couldn't be done in thousands of years can now be done as soon as they are said." In Jinning County, in the thousands of years before liberation, only one reservoir capable of irrigating only 2,000 mu was built. The reactionary ruling class used the excuse of building reservoirs to exploit the people's wealth. However, our commune mobilized 420,000 labor days in two years, greatly developing water conservancy. The amount of work was equivalent to 45 times that before liberation. We also established four pumping stations, realizing water conservancy and a network of rivers. Now the water storage capacity of the commune's water conservancy projects can irrigate more than 75,000 mu, while the amount of water required for the existing cultivated land area accounts for only one-third of the storage capacity. That is to say, even if there is a continuous drought for two years, we can guarantee full planting and not worry about water shortage. The fundamental changes to the past situation where "the riverbed is exposed in April, the sky is scorched in May, floods inundate everywhere in June and July, and there is no harvest for two out of three years" have been realised. The masses generally reflect, "Shangsuan Township comes to Shangsuan Township, the reservoir is built on Beauty Mountain, there is harvest whether it rains or not, thank the Communist Party thousands of times." With the development of farmland water conservancy construction, barren hills and dry land have become grain stores. The cultivated land area of the commune has expanded from 15,000 mu before liberation to 25,000 mu, an increase of 66%. The old wasteland that had been barren for hundreds of years is now fertile land; what used to be barren hills are now granaries.

Commune-Run Industry, Rapid Development

In addition to the annual increase in agricultural production, since the Great Leap Forward, commune-run industry has also greatly developed. One after another, general machinery factories, sulfuric acid factories, granular fertilizer factories, non-staple food processing factories, weaving factories, and other factories of varying sizes have been established, and a coal mine has also been opened. 70% of the simple farm tools needed in the commune can be self-supplied. At the same time, diversified operations were carried out, and sideline production was vigorously developed, so that elderly and weak people who are not suitable for agricultural production can participate in certain sideline production activities; those with skills have the opportunity to give full play to their expertise. Even the elderly in the nursing homes voluntarily engage in some sideline activities that they can do, and have a considerable amount of income.

With the development of agriculture, sideline occupations, and commune-run industry, income has increased year by year, and public accumulation has gradually increased. In recent years, the total public accumulation of the commune has reached more than 1.22 million yuan, which provides more favorable material conditions for further consolidating the People's Commune, further developing agriculture, sideline occupations, and commune-run industry, and accumulating funds for farmland water conservancy, fertilizer chemicalization, agricultural mechanization, and rural electrification. In addition to investing more than 240,000 yuan in water conservancy construction, the commune has also purchased three lathes, three generators, two automobiles, rice mills, flour mills, pumps, engines, and other equipment totaling 17 units, horse carts, seeders, and other various large farm tools totaling more than 500 pieces, which have powerfully promoted industrial and agricultural production. The entire commune has realized transportation by vehicles, semi-mechanized cultivation, and mechanized processing and threshing, saving a large amount of labor.

Eating in Canteens, Receiving Monthly Wages

Our commune adheres to the policy of "walking on two legs," grasping production with one hand and life with the other. From the commune and management area to the production team, a secretary is responsible for life. And we implemented the grain distribution policy of "quantifying according to people, setting quotas for households, collective custody, eating with tickets, and surplus returned to oneself." Therefore, the 38 public canteens in the commune have been continuously consolidated and improved through more than a year of testing. 8,500 agricultural population voluntarily participate in collective meals in the canteen, and many commune cadres and production team leaders go to the canteen in rotation to work as cooks, mingling with the masses and are deeply welcomed by the masses. Due to the development of the cooking utensil technological innovation movement, all canteens have basically realized steam-powered rice cooking, self-flowing water, mechanized and semi-mechanized vegetable cutting, and one stove with multiple pots, greatly reducing the labor intensity of the cooks, saving labor, and improving the quality of food. Each canteen has established collective housework and established a pig farm, raising 50 to 100 pigs and 1 mu of vegetables for every 15 people. Commune members once summarized the four major benefits of public canteens: First, it reduces the scattering and waste of grain and saves grain; second, it saves the labor of cooking, the 38 public canteens in the commune replace more than 500 catering units, saving 180,000 labor days throughout the year, accounting for 15% of the annual labor requirement; third, it saves fuel, 8,500 people eat in the entire commune, saving 1.4 million jin of fuel throughout the year; fourth, it saves expenses, the fuel cost alone saves 21,000 yuan in one year. Not only that, the significance and role of public canteens have greatly exceeded our original expectations. It is not only a place for collective meals, but also a center for the broad masses of commune members to carry out political, economic, and cultural activities, and an important cornerstone of the People's Commune.

In order to further give play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of women, in addition to running the public canteens well, the commune added 296 sewing machines to replace manual sewing of clothes and set up 47 nurseries and kindergartens, freeing more than 700 women laborers from the burden of children and putting them into agricultural production and construction, saving 90,000 labor days throughout the year, accounting for 8% of the annual labor demand. The broad masses of women use their own personal experience to praise the benefits of public canteens and nurseries: "In the past, women revolved around the pot, firewood, rice, oil, and salt cans, the baby cried and made noise, suffering and tired in the heart. Since the establishment of the People's Commune, participate in the great construction of workers and peasants, after production, enter the canteen, the public canteen's food is delicious. The baby enters the nursery, the body is good and the baby is obedient, in a happy mood to engage in production, work actively and efficiently.

On the basis of the increasing consolidation of the People's Commune and the continuous development of production, the life of commune members has been greatly improved. The distribution policy combining the wage system and the supply system has been implemented, guaranteeing the payment of wages on a quarterly and monthly basis. A total of 340,000 yuan was paid in wages in the past year, averaging 164 yuan per laborer, and a partial supply system was implemented, basically solving the problems of "overspending households" and "empty distribution households" that had not been solved for many years, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. They generally praise the benefits of the Party's policy, saying, "Production steps up, life gets sweeter." They also say: "The life of the peasants is like climbing stairs, step by step, like eating sugar cane, the more you eat to the root, the sweeter it gets." The commune also runs nursing homes, so that 5% of the "difficult households" and the helpless "five-guarantee households" are taken care of and supported. Li Hushi, a 65-year-old blind granny, said emotionally, "People say that parents are the closest, I say that Chairman Mao is even closer than parents." She actively strives to work, doing 250 workdays in a year, singing: "The People's Commune is really good, the elderly also laugh in their dreams. One laugh at the good days of the commune, two laughs at the new appearance of the countryside." Duan Bingzhi's mother, who is over 90 years old, said: "Before liberation, my three sons and nine daughters could not support me, now the Communist Party and Chairman Mao lead, set up the People's Commune, entered the nursing home, and the days are very sweet."

Heaven is False, the People's Commune is Heaven on Earth

While improving material life, cultural life has also greatly developed. The commune runs an agricultural middle school, three complete primary schools, and 23 junior primary schools. 98% of school-age children have enrolled. Night schools have been opened in all 38 production teams. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated among young and middle-aged people. The commune has a film team, which has screened more than 200 films in the past year, with more than 120,000 viewers. There is also a library, a broadcasting station, a central hospital, three health stations, three midwifery stations, and 38 health kits. In order to gradually improve the living conditions of the members, the commune has built a new village on a trial basis, with a total of 292 rooms. A large number of members have moved into new houses, and they generally reflect: "A stone of sesame seeds can be counted, the benefits of the People's Commune cannot be said enough. In the past, they all said that heaven is good, but heaven is not as strong as the commune. Heaven is false, the People's Commune is heaven on earth." "Communism is heaven, the People's Commune is a bridge, always follow the Communist Party, and rise step by step to heaven."

Due to the continuous leaps forward in the past two years, the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of cadres and masses has been greatly encouraged, and they have fully invested in the current spring plowing production, setting off a wave of labor emulation. More than 2,000 advanced people have emerged. It is estimated that the output of small spring crops will have a considerable increase compared to last year. The accumulation of fertilizer has been completed 98%, 5,000 mu of new fields have been opened, 6,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, and the production of live pigs has reached 5,000 heads, an increase of 50% compared to the end of 1959. But we must not be complacent because of this, we must make persistent efforts, advance victoriously, hold high the three red banners even higher, overcome any difficulties, and strive to achieve continuous leaps forward in 1960!

    生产步步高　生活节节甜
    李能代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告和常务委员会的工作报告。	农业生产，连续丰收
    我们云南省晋宁县上蒜人民公社和全国一样，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，全体社员高举社会主义建设总路线，大跃进和人民公社三面红旗，鼓足干劲，战胜了各种自然灾害，1959年，在农业战线上又获得了连续跃进，全社粮食总产量比1958年增加53％，每人平均有粮一千六百一十八斤。农副业总收入达到一百零三万元，比1958年增加27％，每人平均一百二十五元，分配给社员部分五十三万元，比1958年增加28％，保证了90％以上的社员增加了收入，社员每人平均收入已超过富裕农民单干收入的50％以上，粮食超过三倍半。社员们高唱“总路线是明灯，照得上蒜亮晶晶，人人执行总路线，黄土也要变成金。”两年来，我们遵照党中央和毛主席的指示，在上级党委的领导下，认真执行了农业“八字宪法”，首先抓住群众的迫切要求，开展了轰轰烈烈的农田水利建设运动，把柴河水库原来二十二米高的拦水坝加高了五米，增加蓄水量九百万方。还在海拔二千五百多米的高山上修了一个水库，在山腰挖了二十多华里长的两条渠道，让河水穿过高山围绕着山腰，驯服地为农业生产服务。当开始兴修这个水利工程时，一位七十多岁的老人怀疑地说：“你们这些年轻小伙子不要做梦，给你们挖一辈子也修不好。”但是，事实出乎他的意料之外，用不着一辈子，仅仅四十多天就完工了。使他受到了深刻的教育，他非常感动地说：“共产党、毛主席的领导真是了不起，几千年做不到的事，现在说到就做到。”晋宁县，在解放前的千百年间，才修了一个仅能灌溉二千亩的水库，反动统治阶级借口修水库，不知搜刮了多少民脂民膏。而我们一个公社，在两年内就出动了四十二万个劳动工日，大兴水利，工程量相当于解放前的四十五倍，还建立了四个抽水机站，实现了水利化，河网化。现在全社水利工程蓄水量可灌溉七万五千亩以上，而现有耕地面积所需水量，仅占蓄水量的三分之一。就是说，即使连续干旱两年，也可以保证满栽满插，不愁缺水。根本改变了过去“四月晒河底，五月火烧天，六七月洪水到处淹，三年两不收”的灾荒景象。群众普遍反映说：“上蒜乡来上蒜乡，水库打在美女山，有雨无雨都丰收，千谢万谢共产党。”随着农田水利建设的发展，荒山旱地变成了粮食仓，全社耕地面积由解放前的一万五千亩扩大到二万五千亩，增加了66％。过去荒了几百年的老荒滩，现在成良田；往年是荒山，现在成粮仓。	社办工业，发展很快
    除农业生产年年增产外，大跃进以来，社办工业也有了很大的发展。先后办起了通用机械厂，硫酸厂，颗粒肥料厂，副食品加工厂，织布厂等大小不等的工厂，还开了一个煤矿。社内所需的简单农具，70％可以自给。同时开展了多种经营，大搞副业生产，使年老体弱不宜从事农业生产的人，都能参加一定的副业生产的活动；有一技之长的人都有机会发挥他的特长。甚至敬老院的老年人，也自愿地搞一些力所能任的副业，有相当数量的收入。
    随着农副业和社办工业的发展，收入逐年增多，公共积累也逐步增加。几年以来，全社公共积累共达一百二十二万多元，这就为进一步巩固人民公社，进一步发展农副业和社办工业，提供了更有利的物质条件，为农田水利化，肥料化学化，农业机械化，农村电气化筹积了资金。全社除投资水利建设二十四万多元外，还购买了车床三台，发电机三部，汽车两部，碾米机、磨面机、抽水机、引擎等共十七部，马车、播种机及其他各种大农具五百多件，有力地促进了工农业生产。全社已实现了运输车子化，耕作半机械化，加工脱粒机械化，节约了大量劳动力。	吃饭有食堂，按月发工资
    我们公社坚持了“两条腿走路”的方针，一手抓生产，一手抓生活，从公社、管理区到生产队都由一个书记专管生活。并且贯彻执行了“以人定量，指标到户，集体保管，凭票吃饭，节余归己”的粮食分配政策，因此，全社三十八个公共食堂，通过一年多的考验，不断得到巩固与提高。八千五百个农业人口都自愿参加食堂集体开饭，许多社干部和生产队长，有计划地深入食堂轮流当炊事员，和群众打成一片，深受群众欢迎。由于开展了炊具技术革新运动，全部食堂已基本实现了蒸饭蒸气化，引水自流化，切菜机械化和半机械化，一灶多锅化，大大地减轻了炊事人员的劳动强度，节约了劳动力，提高了饭菜质量。每个食堂都建立了集体家务，建立了养猪场，养猪五十到一百头，每十五人一亩菜。社员们曾经总结了公共食堂的四大好处：一是减少了粮食抛撒浪费，节约了粮食；二是节约煮饭的劳动力，全社三十八个公共食堂就代替了五百多个伙食单位，全年节约十八万个劳动工日，占全年劳动需工量的15％；三是节约燃料，全公社八千五百个人开饭，全年节约燃料一百四十万斤；四是节约开支，一年来单燃料费用就节约了人民币二万一千元。不仅这样，公共食堂的意义和作用已经大大地超出了我们原来的设想，它不只是集体开伙的场所，而是广大社员开展政治、经济、文化活动的中心，是人民公社的重要基石。
    为了进一步发挥广大妇女的积极性，除办好公共食堂外，全社添置二百九十六部缝纫机代替人工缝衣，办了托儿所、幼儿园四十七个，使七百多个妇女劳动力摆脱了孩子的拖累，投入了农业生产建设，全年节约劳动工日九万个，占全年需工数的8％。广大妇女用自己的亲身体验，歌颂公共食堂和托儿所的好处：“过去妇女锅边转，柴米油盐罐罐罐，娃娃哭啼又吵闹，受苦受累心里焦。自从成立大公社，参加工农大建设，生产完了进食堂，公共食堂饭菜香。娃娃进了托儿所，身体好来娃娃乖，心情舒畅搞生产，干活积极工效高。
    在人民公社日益巩固和生产不断发展的基础上，社员生活大大改善。贯彻执行了工资制与供给制相结合的分配政策。保证了按季按月发付工资，去年一年内共发了工资三十四万元，平均每个劳动力一百六十四元，并实行了部分供给制，基本上解决了历年没有解决的“超支户”和“分空户”的问题，调动了广大社员的积极性。普遍赞扬党的政策的好处，都说“生产步步高，生活节节甜”。又说：“农民生活好像上楼梯一样，步步登高，像吃甘蔗一样，越吃到根越甜。”公社还举办了敬老院，使5％的“困难户”和无依无靠的“五保户”，得到了照顾和扶养。六十五岁的瞎子老奶李胡氏感动地说：“人说爹娘是最亲，我说毛主席比爹娘还亲”。她积极争取劳动，一年还做二百五十个劳动日，歌唱：“人民公社实在好，老人也会梦中笑。一笑公社日子好，二笑农村新面貌”。九十多岁的段炳之母说：“解放前，我三个儿子九个姑娘还养不活我，现在共产党毛主席领导，办了大公社，进了敬老院，日子过得咪咪甜”。	天堂真假没见过，人间天堂是公社
    在提高物质生活的同时，文化生活也有了很大的发展。全社办了一个农业中学、三所完小和二十三所初小，适龄儿童已有98％入学，三十八个生产队都开办了夜校，在青壮年中基本上扫除了文盲，公社有一个电影队，一年来放映了二百多场，观众达十二万多人次，还有一个图书馆，一个广播站，一个中心医院，三个保健站，三个接生站，三十八个保健箱。为了逐步改善社员居住条件，公社试建了一个新农村，共二百九十二间，大批社员住上了新房，普遍反映说：“一石芝麻数得清，人民公社好处说不完。从前都说天堂好，天堂那有公社强。天堂真假没见过，人间天堂是公社。”“共产主义是天堂，人民公社是桥梁，永远跟着共产党，步步高升上天堂。”
    由于两年以来的连续跃进，大大鼓舞了广大干部和群众的革命干劲，全力投入了当前的春耕生产，掀起了劳动竞赛的热潮，已涌现了先进人物二千多人。小春产量，预计将比去年有相当大的增长。积肥已完成98％，新开田五千亩，开荒地六千亩，生猪生产已达五千头，比1959年年底增加了50％。但我们丝毫不能因此自满，一定要再接再厉，乘胜前进，更高地举起三面红旗，克服任何困难，为实现1960年的连续跃进而奋斗！
