Chairman, fellow representatives:

    I fully endorse the reports made to the assembly by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, respectively, and I guarantee to implement them in practical work. Now, I would like to report to the assembly on the situation of the Nan Street area of Fuzhou City in organizing an urban people's commune.
    The Nan Street area of Fuzhou City has more than 5,700 households and more than 26,000 people, of which the families of workers and staff members and street residents account for about 60%. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production, there has been an urgent need for the city to organize the idle labor force in society to participate in production. Under the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward in production and construction, the broad masses of workers' families and street residents have also become increasingly eager to organize and participate in socialist construction. Driven by the rapid realization of people's communes in rural areas across the country, the Nan Street People's Commune was established in September 1958. For more than a year, the commune has started by organizing production, vigorously developing street industries, vigorously developing collective welfare undertakings and social service undertakings, and leading the scattered housework towards collectivization and socialization. This has freed the vast number of housewives from housework and happily placed them in production and construction posts, bringing about profound changes in the economic outlook of the entire street and the mental outlook of the residents.
    In the past year or so, in addition to transferring more than 3,300 laborers (mainly women) to participate in national industrial production and urban construction, the Nan Street People's Commune, following the policy of "serving large state-owned factories, serving the people's lives, and serving agricultural production," has vigorously developed street industries from scratch and from small to large, based on the spirit of self-reliance and hard work. In 1958, the commune established seven factories with 316 workers participating in production, and the output value reached more than 66,000 yuan in three months. In 1959, it developed to 22 factories with 882 workers, and the annual output value was 260,000 yuan. Since the beginning of this year, under the call of the commune's Party committee for "one factory per residents' group," street factories have rapidly developed to 214, the number of workers has increased to 2,190, and 620 people are engaged in public welfare and service undertakings. Except for the old, weak, and disabled who cannot participate in labor, the number of people organized to participate in labor production accounts for 98% of the number of people who can participate in labor, truly realizing "production everywhere, no idle people in every household." These street factories mainly manufacture small commodities, process semi-finished products for large factories, and comprehensively utilize the waste materials of large factories. These factories require little investment, simple equipment, and easy-to-master technology. At the same time, they do not compete with state-owned factories for raw materials or labor. They have both mass production and sporadic processing, and adopt various production forms suitable for women with many children and semi-laborers to participate in. Therefore, from the very beginning, they have shown the role of "picking up the slack and filling the gaps" in social production. The twelve production brigades (formerly neighborhood committees) each run a chemical factory, most of which use the waste water and waste materials of the Fuzhou First and Second Chemical Factories to produce important chemical raw materials such as caustic soda using indigenous methods. At present, the commune's industrial products include more than 70 kinds of chemical raw materials, automobile parts, small hardware, furniture, stationery, cardboard boxes, shoe soles, bottle stoppers, and mesh bags. The total output value from January to mid-March this year has reached more than 410,000 yuan. This plays a significant role in increasing social commodities, assisting large factory production, meeting market needs, increasing commune members' income, and improving people's lives. Now, the commune is actively expanding production and has already set a plan to increase this year's output value by 40 to 50 times compared to last year.
    While vigorously developing industry and grasping production, the commune has comprehensively organized the economic life of its members around production. Taking the public canteen as the center, it has vigorously developed livelihood and welfare undertakings and service undertakings, creating a new collective lifestyle for the people. The commune's fifteen public canteens are all well-run, with a wide variety of dishes, good taste, low prices, and attentive service. Moreover, according to the production characteristics of the workers in each factory, the canteens are run like restaurants, providing meals whenever workers arrive, ensuring that the food is cooked and the dishes are hot, which is very convenient. Many canteens not only provide meals but also deliver food, dishes, and boiling water to homes and factories. They also prepare snacks for workers who work at night. Because the canteens are well-run, the number of fixed diners has rapidly increased from more than 2,000 to more than 5,000, with more than 2,000 transient diners. The commune has also established thirteen nurseries, children's groups, and kindergartens, one hospital, and one home for the elderly, as well as 158 service stations. The nurseries run by the commune are entirely based on the convenience of the members and the benefit of production, adopting a variety of methods such as full-time care, half-time care, temporary care, individual care, and bringing children to work. At present, more than 1,500 children are being cared for, allowing thousands of mothers to work with peace of mind. It also provides reduced fees or free care based on the economic situation of some members. The service stations (points) scattered throughout the commune's streets and alleys provide comprehensive and meticulous care for the members' lives. The service items include mending, knitting, washing, repairing houses, repairing leaks, hiring odd jobs, finding nannies, calling pedicabs, cleaning, beautifying homes, subscribing to newspapers and periodicals, delivering letters and newspapers, caring for patients, and taking care of the "Five Guarantees" households, totaling no less than sixty or seventy kinds, and have gradually developed from general supply services to a new stage of comprehensive service for clothing, food, housing, transportation, birth, old age, support, marriage, and funerals. Some service stations have taken over all of the "seven new things to do after opening the door" (fetching water, delivering meals, picking up and dropping off children, washing clothes, cleaning, etc.) for the "Five Guarantees" households, "single-person households," and "double-income families" (where both husband and wife are workers). Some production brigades have also promoted and carried forward the fine tradition of mutual assistance in life among relatives and neighbors, and established unpaid mutual assistance groups. They are gradually using the labor of a small number of people in the service stations to free the vast number of members from tedious housework, making the social division of labor more perfect and reasonable, and making labor productivity increase day by day, bringing unlimited joy and happiness to the members, especially the street women. For example, Guo Shuying, a female worker at the cotton weaving factory, used to get sick frequently due to the burden of heavy housework, and her monthly attendance averaged only about 10%. Her husband and son also had to ask for leave to take care of her. After the establishment of the service station, people were sent to cook, boil medicine, and do housework for her until she recovered her health. With the help of the service station, she has not been absent from work once in the past three months; her husband can also work with peace of mind and has been named an advanced worker. The commune members call the service departments "the promoters of the Great Leap Forward" and "the housekeepers of life," and regard their work as the Party's meticulous care for the people.
    The development of the commune's collective welfare undertakings and service undertakings can more rationally organize commodity distribution. They implement planned fixed-point and sub-area contracting methods, and have established twelve commodity supply outlets and five consignment stalls in each production brigade. Under the leadership of state-owned stores, they carry out rational distribution and supply of commodities in the form of agency purchase and sales, operating more than 400 varieties. Materials that are subject to planned supply are distributed through them, and commodities with small supply and festive commodities are also sold through them in an orderly manner. This not only makes the layout of the commercial network more reasonable and facilitates the masses, but also guides the members to plan their consumption according to the needs of commodity planned production and planned supply. The supply outlets also put forward the slogan of "visiting hundreds of households, walking thousands of families, and delivering goods to the door, doing a good job in supply," reducing the time for members to go back and forth to buy goods, which is generally satisfactory to the members.
    After the Nan Street People's Commune vigorously developed street industries and realized the collectivization of life and the socialization of housework, the relationship between people is gradually changing, the ideology of collectivism and the communist moral qualities are rapidly growing, and the mental outlook of the members is undergoing profound changes. The lofty style of loving labor, advocating thrift, loving the collective, and daring to do what is right has become the general trend of society. Hua Meiguan, a resident who used to dislike labor, changed her old habit of laziness after joining the laundry group in the commune. She twice found more than 40 yuan and more than 100 yuan in the pockets of clothes and returned them all to their owners. This kind of honesty was praised by the people. The vast number of members have gradually developed a good habit of living frugally. Due to the widespread establishment of service stations and their tireless mending, alteration, and repair work, a large number of broken umbrellas, broken shoes, and broken clothes of workers and residents have been reused. Many service personnel work diligently for the members without regard to time or pay. Lin Ruiying, a woman, automatically spends one or two hours a day doing housework for four or five "Five Guarantees" households and "double-income families" without asking for any compensation. Liu Yongnian, a military dependent, fell ill and no one took care of him, so the service station sent people to deliver soup and medicine, and to empty his chamber pot, which made him grateful to tears. Even the fourteen elderly people in the home for the elderly, with an average age of over 75, are unwilling to sit idle and eat, and actively participate in light labor such as dismantling old shirts and socks, earning three or four yuan of pocket money each month. Huang Youzhen, a 67-year-old woman in the home for the elderly, wrote a poem with her left hand because her right hand was disabled, saying: "The happy family is harmonious, the old people are happy to live together, they can rely on life and death without worry, and the brilliance is full of red." The phenomenon of each family caring only for itself, not caring about each other, and often arguing over trivial matters that used to exist between neighbors is gone forever, replaced by a new atmosphere of harmony, unity, mutual respect, and mutual assistance.
    Because the commune grasps production with one hand and life with the other, and increases income and reduces expenditure simultaneously, the income of the members has generally increased. Before the commune was established, there were 282 households and more than 600 people in need of relief. After the establishment of the commune, through organizing production and services, all those who could work were arranged for work, leaving only 43 households and 66 people who had lost their ability to work due to old age, weakness, disability, and their relief funds were all paid by the commune's welfare funds, and the state no longer had to bear the burden.
    Fellow representatives, although we have only focused on piloting several urban people's communes in the past year or so, practice has proven that it has the same strong vitality and unparalleled superiority as the rural people's communes. Therefore, as soon as it was born, it gained rapid growth with the love and support of the broad masses. The establishment of urban people's communes marks a new and major progress in China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. It has promoted a more profound change in the relations of production in cities, especially the large number of women who have been freed from tedious housework and投入了社会劳动, greatly developing social productive forces. It widely organizes people's economic life and develops cultural undertakings according to the needs of the new situation, opening up a broad road for urban residents to move towards a happy collective life. Due to the major changes in production and life, the mental outlook of the vast number of urban residents has also rapidly undergone fundamental changes conducive to socialism and communism. Now, the people of Fujian are actively implementing the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and have launched a upsurge in vigorously developing urban people's communes. We believe that it will not be long before urban people's communes will become universal, and a brand new situation will emerge in the urban socialist construction undertaking. The traces of the old city left over for thousands of years will disappear forever before our eyes!

    城市人民公社有强大的生命力
    刘培善代表谈福州南街人民公社在成长主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念和谭震林三位
  副总理分别向大会所作的报告，并保证在实际
  工作中贯彻执行。现在，我就福州市南街组织城市人民公社的情况向大会作一汇报。
    福州市南街地区共有五千七百多户、二万六千多人，其中职工家属和街道居民占60％左右。大跃进以来，随着工农业生产的高速度发展，迫切要求城市把社会上的闲散劳力组织起来，参加生产；而广大职工家属和街道居民在生产建设大跃进的形势鼓舞下，要求组织起来参加社会主义建设的愿望也越来越强烈，加以受各地农村迅速实现了人民公社化的推动，因而在1958年9月间办起了南街人民公社。一年多来，公社从组织生产入手，大办街道工业，大办集体福利事业和社会服务事业，把分散的家务劳动引向了集体化、社会化，使广大的家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，愉快地走上了生产建设岗位，使整个街道的经济面貌和居民的精神面貌都发生了深刻的变化。
    一年多来，南街人民公社除输送了三千三百多个劳力（主要是妇女）参加国家工业生产和城市建设外，还遵循着“为国营大工厂服务、为人民生活服务、为农业生产服务”的方针，本着自力更生、白手起家的精神，使街道工业从无到有、从小到大地蓬勃发展起来。1958年，全社办了有三百一十六个工人参加生产的七个工厂，三个月中产值达到六万六千多元；1959年发展到二十二个厂、工人八百八十二人，年产值二十六万元。今年以来，在公社党委的“一组（居民小组）一厂”的号召下，街道工厂迅速发展到二百一十四个，工人增加到二千一百九十人，从事公共福利、服务事业劳动的六百二十人。全社除了老弱残废不能参加劳动的人以外，组织起来参加劳动生产的人数，已占能参加劳动人数的98％，真正实现了“处处闹生产，户户无闲人”。这些街道工厂主要是制造小商品、为大工厂加工半成品和综合利用大工厂的下脚料。这些厂投资少，设备简单，技术容易掌握，同时不与国营工厂争原料争劳力，既有成批生产，又有零星加工，并采取多种适合多子女妇女和半劳力参加的生产形式，因此一开始兴办就在社会生产中显示出“拾遗补缺”的作用。全社十二个生产大队（原居委会）各办的一个化工厂，大都是利用福州第一、第二化工厂的废水下脚料，用土法生产出烧碱等重要化工原料。目前全社工业产品有化工原料、汽车零件、小五金、家具、文具、纸盒、鞋底、瓶塞、网袋等七十多种，从今年1月到3月中旬的总产值已达四十一万多元。这对于增加社会商品、协助大工厂生产、满足市场需要、增加社员收入和提高人民生活方面都起着很大的作用。现在该社正在积极扩大生产，并已订出计划，要使今年的产值比去年跃增四十到五十倍。
    公社在大办工业大抓生产的同时，围绕生产全面地组织了社员的经济生活，以公共食堂为中心，大办生活福利事业和服务事业，创立了人们新的集体主义的生活。公社的十五个公共食堂都办得很出色，饭菜品种多、味道好，价廉物美，服务周到，而且根据各厂职工生产的特点，实行食堂饭店化，做到随到随吃，保证饭熟菜热，十分方便。许多食堂不仅供应饭菜，还把饭菜、开水送上门、送到工厂；还为夜间生产、工作的职工准备点心。由于食堂办得好，固定用膳人数已从二千多人迅速增加到五千多人，还有二千多流动用膳人口。公社还办了十三个托儿所、娃娃组和幼儿园，一个医院和一个敬老院，建立了一百五十八个服务站。公社办的托儿所，完全从便利社员、有利生产出发，采取全托、半托、临时托、个别托和跟班带孩子等多种多样方式。目前受托儿童已达一千五百多个，使上千个母亲能以安心生产。它还根据某些社员的经济情况，实行减费或免费受托。遍布全社大街小巷的服务站（点），对社员们生活上的照顾更是无所不至，体贴入微。服务项目有缝补、针织、洗衣、修房、补漏、雇杂工、找保姆、叫三轮车、打扫卫生、美化家庭、代订报刊、送信送报、护理病人、照顾“五保户”等不下六七十种，并已从一般的供应服务逐步发展到对衣食住行、生老扶养和婚丧喜庆全面服务的新阶段。有的服务站已将“五保户”、“单干户”和“双职工”（夫妻都是职工）的“新开门七件事”（打水、送饭、接送孩子、洗衣服、打扫卫生等）全部包下来。有的生产大队还将群众原有的亲帮亲、邻帮邻的生活互助的优良传统加以提倡发扬，成立了不计报酬的生活互助组。他们正逐步以服务站少数人的劳动使广大社员摆脱繁琐的家务劳动，使社会分工更加完善合理，使劳动生产率日益提高，给社员尤其是街道妇女带来了无限的喜悦和幸福。如棉织厂女工郭淑英，过去由于繁重的家务牵累经常生病，每月出工平均只10％左右，她爱人、儿子还要请假侍候她。服务站成立后，就派人为她烧饭、煎药、做家务，直到她恢复健康为止。在服务站帮助之下，最近三个月来她都没有缺过一次勤；她爱人也能安心生产，被评为先进工作者。社员们把服务部门称作“大跃进的促进派”和“生活的管家人”，把他们的工作看作是党对人民群众无微不至的关怀。
    公社集体福利事业和服务事业的发展，就能更合理地组织商品分配工作。他们实行计划定点、分片包干的办法，在各个生产大队建立了十二个商品供应门市部和五个代销摊，在国营商店的领导下，以代购代销的形式进行商品的合理分配和供应，经营的品种达四百多种。实行计划供应的物资都通过它们进行分配，供应量少的商品和节日商品也通过它有秩序地进行销售。这样不仅使商业网的摆布更加合理，便利了群众，同时还能根据商品计划生产和计划供应的需要，指导社员计划消费。供应门市部还提出“串百户、走千家、送货上门，做好供应”的口号，减少社员购买货物来回奔走的时间，社员普遍感到满意。
    南街人民公社大办街道工业、并实现了生活集体化和家务劳动社会化以后，人与人之间的关系正在逐步改变，集体主义思想和共产主义道德品质正在迅速成长，社员们的精神面貌正在发生深刻的变化。热爱劳动，崇尚节约，热爱集体，见义勇为的崇高风格，已成为社会的普遍风尚。居民华妹官过去不爱劳动，参加公社到洗衣组以后，改掉了过去好逸恶劳的旧习气。她曾两次发现衣服口袋装有四十多元和一百多元人民币都悉数归还了原主，这种拾金不昧，受到了人们的赞扬。广大社员逐渐养成了勤俭节约过日子的好习惯，由于服务站的普遍设立，和它们不厌其烦的缝补、改制和修理工作，使职工、居民大量的破伞、破鞋、破衣衫等重新得到利用。不少服务员更是不计时间、不计报酬地辛勤为社员们服务。妇女林瑞英每天自动花一两个钟点时间为四、五家“五保户”和“双职工”做家务琐事，并不要任何报酬。军属刘永年病了无人照顾，服务站就派人为他送汤煎药、端尿倒屎，使他感激得流下泪来。就连敬老院中十四位平均年龄在七十五岁以上的老人，也不愿闲着吃饭，主动参加拆旧衫破袜等轻微劳动，每月能收入三、四元零用钱。敬老院六十七岁的老太太黄右贞右手残废了，她激动的用左手写了一首诗说：“幸福之家乐融融，老人晚景喜相从，高枕无忧生死靠，光芒万丈满地红”。过去里邻间那种各自一家、互不关心、常为琐事争吵的现象已经一去不复返，代之而起的是一片和睦团结、互敬互助的新气象。
    由于公社一手抓生产、一手抓生活，开源节流齐头并进，因而社员收入普遍增加。办公社以前原有二百八十二户、六百多人需要救济，办公社后通过组织生产和服务，有劳力的都安排了工作，剩下的只有丧失了劳动力的老弱残废四十三户、六十六人，而且他们的救济金也全部由公社的福利费支出，再也不用国家负担。
    各位代表，过去一年多来，我们虽然只重点试办几个城市人民公社，但实践证明，它和农村人民公社一样的具有强大的生命力和无比的优越性。因此，它一诞生，就在广大群众的热爱和支持下获得了迅速的成长。城市人民公社的创立，标志着我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的一个新的重大的进展。它促使城市的生产关系起了更加深刻的变革，特别是大批妇女摆脱了繁琐的家务投入了社会劳动，大大发展了社会生产力。它依据新的形势需要，广泛地组织人民经济生活和发展文化事业，为城市居民走向幸福的集体主义生活，开辟了广阔的道路。由于生产、生活的重大变革，使城市广大居民的精神面貌也迅速发生了有利于社会主义共产主义的根本的变化。现在，我们福建人民正在积极贯彻党中央和毛主席的指示，掀起了一个大办城市人民公社的热潮。我们相信，不要多久的时间，城市人民公社就会普遍化起来，随之城市社会主义建设事业就会出现一个崭新的局面，而千百年来遗留下来的旧城市的痕迹，将会在我们眼前永远消逝！
