A Life of Struggle
    Song Hongxun

    Lenin's life was a life of struggle, just as he himself said in a letter to Inessa Armand: "This is my fate. Continuous battles—against all kinds of stupid and vulgar ideas in politics, against opportunism, etc. This has been going on since 1893. This is where the hatred of the philistines comes from. But I will never abandon this fate to make 'peace' with the philistines."
    Lenin dedicated his glorious life to the struggle against enemies of all shapes and sizes.

    The most prominent aspect of Lenin's life of struggle is the clarity of his emotional activity. Comrade Krzhizhanovsky once mentioned in a memoir that during his exile in Siberia, he once said to Lenin that a surgeon believed that a person's health lies in the vividness of emotional expression. Lenin replied at the time: "That's right. A healthy person wants to eat, he really wants to eat; wants to sleep, he won't be particular about whether he sleeps on a soft bed; he wants to hate, and he will truly hate...." Lenin was such an example of a healthy person with very clear emotions.

    In every article in the "Collected Works of Lenin," whether it is a report on current events, a political essay, or a short letter, it is full of unrestrained passion and the vitality of a genius language. Lenin's sometimes sarcastic and concise language towards enemies and traitors makes you feel that he is a merciless enemy; and his sometimes short but heartfelt, patient, and earnest words towards his comrades make you feel that he is a loyal friend and a close comrade.

    In Volume 7 of the "Collected Works of Lenin," there is a political essay entitled "Exposed!..." The article begins with a dramatic and brilliant dialogue. The first person in the dialogue is a true Marxist, and the second person is a glib-tongued fake revolutionary. The true Marxist used a few brief rhetorical questions to expose the hypocritical face of the "revolutionary," and in the end, the eloquent "orator" could only stammer "Tha...tha...tha."

    When I read this article, I was deeply attracted by Lenin's genius imagination and witty style, but what moved me even more was Lenin's mercilessness towards such "revolutionaries" hidden behind this dialogue.

    After reading this article, if we compare it with Lenin's many letters to Gorky, then another kind and moving image emerges before us. Just as Gorky himself said, the image of "a stern teacher and a kind 'thoughtful' friend."

    Lenin was such a person: for the enemy, he was the most merciless enemy; for his own comrades, he was the most affectionate comrade.

    Lenin's energy was truly inexhaustible. In the short period of more than three months from July to October 1917, he wrote more than sixty papers, pamphlets, and letters, including such brilliant classic works as "The State and Revolution," "The Impending Catastrophe and How to Combat It," and "Marxism and Insurrection." Opening the "Collected Works of Lenin," Volumes 24, 25, and 26, you can see that the date of each article is almost one day after another, and sometimes three or four articles are written on the same day. It should also be particularly pointed out that Lenin wrote these articles not in a comfortable office, nor in a quiet study, but under the conditions of the Provisional Government's frenzied persecution, in the extremely secret homes of workers, in the thatched shed on the shores of Lake Razliv, and in the underground life of Helsinki. "Do a year's work in a day," this was the slogan followed by the great warrior Lenin when engaged in revolutionary activities.

    Lenin exhausted all his brainpower and dedicated all his energy to the most magnificent cause in the world.

    斗争的一生
    宋洪训
    列宁的一生就是斗争的一生，正如他自己在给印涅萨·阿尔曼德的信里说的：“这就是我的命运。连续不断的战斗——反对政治上的各种愚蠢思想和庸俗见解，反对机会主义等等。这是从1893年开始的。庸人们的仇视就是由此而来的。但是，我无论如何不会抛弃这个命运去同庸人们讲‘和平’。”
    列宁就是在跟形形色色的敌人的斗争中献出了自己光辉的一生。
    在列宁的斗争的一生当中，最突出的一点，就是他的感情活动非常鲜明。克尔日扎诺夫斯基同志在一篇回忆中曾经谈到，在西伯利亚流放时期，有一次他对列宁说，一位外科医生认为一个人的健康就在于感情活动表现得很鲜明。列宁当时回答说：“就是这样。一个健康的人想吃东西，他就真正想吃，想睡觉，他就不会讲究是否要睡软床，他要憎恨，也就会真正的憎恨……。”列宁就是这样一个感情非常鲜明的健康人的典范。
    在“列宁全集”的每篇文章中，无论是一篇时事题材的报告，无论是一篇政论性的短文，或者是一封简短的书信，都洋溢着奔放澎湃的热情和天才语言的活力。列宁对敌人和叛徒，有时反语相讥，言简意赅，使你感觉到他就是一个毫不容情的敌人；而对自己的同志，有时语短心长，循循善诱，使你感觉到他就是一个忠实的朋友和亲切的同志。
    在“列宁全集”第7卷上有一篇政论性文章，题目是“拆穿了！……”。文章一开头就是一段富有戏剧性的闪闪发光的对话。对话的第一人是一个真正的马克思主义者，对话的第二人是一个花言巧语的假革命者。真正的马克思主义者用简短的几句反问把“革命者”的虚伪面孔拆穿无遗，到最后那位善于词令的“雄辩家”也只好“那……那……那”了。
    当我读到这篇文章的时候，我深深地被列宁的天才的臆想和机锋的笔触吸引住了，但是更使我感动的却是隐藏在这段对话后面的列宁对这类“革命者”的毫不容情。
    看了这段文章，我们再来对照阅读一下列宁给高尔基的许多书信，那末在我们面前又浮现出另外一个亲切动人的形象。正如高尔基自己说的，“一个严厉的教师和一个和善的‘体贴入微’的朋友”的形象。
    列宁就是这样一个人：对于敌人来说，他是最无情的敌人；对于自己的同志来说，他是最亲切的同志。
    列宁的精力真是无穷无尽的。从1917年7月到10月短短的三个多月当中，他写了六十多篇论文、小册子和书信，其中包括像“国家与革命”、“大难临头，出路何在？”、“马克思主义和起义”等这样一些辉煌的经典著作。翻开“列宁全集”第24、25、26卷，就可以看到，每篇文章写的日期几乎是一天连着一天，有时候三、四篇文章就是在同一天内写成的。这里还应当特别指出，列宁写这些文章并不是在舒适的办公室里，也不是在幽静的书斋里，而是在临时政府疯狂迫害的条件下，在极端秘密的工人家里，在拉兹里夫湖畔的茅草棚里，在赫尔辛福斯的地下生活中。“一天要做一年的事情”，这就是伟大的战士列宁在从事革命活动时所遵循的口号。
    列宁就是这样为世界上最壮丽的事业耗尽了自己的全部脑汁，献出了自己的全部精力。
