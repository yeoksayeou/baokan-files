    Let the Red Flag Fly Forever
    Notes on the Filming of the Large-Scale Documentary "The Red Flag Flying"
    Ji Gong

    Recently, while admiring the excellent film "For Sixty-One Class Brothers," people watched "The Red Flag Flying" with the same excitement. From April 2nd to 11th, the number of viewers in Beijing reached 530,000. This shows that if our art can closely integrate with the pulse of the times, it will be welcomed by the broad masses of the people.

    During the sixty-odd minutes of the screening, the audience, as if on the scene, witnessed the vivid scenes of "innovative flowers blooming everywhere, production records renewing daily" beside machines, in front of blast furnaces, down in mines, and on construction sites. The film also fully demonstrated the tremendous changes in Beijing's industrial and agricultural construction.

    This was the first time the Beijing Film Studio had produced such a large-scale documentary. With the lofty ambition of "singing the red flag with a red heart," they rushed to film it in sixteen working days. In February of this year, the technical revolution movement in Beijing surged, and the city's industrial front heroes' conference opened amidst frequent leap forward reports. The Party Committee of the Beijing Film Studio, according to instructions from higher authorities, wanted to promptly reflect these inspiring advanced deeds. The filmmakers were also deeply encouraged and assured the Party that, in addition to their original filming tasks, they would produce another documentary to let the flames of the technical revolution ignited by advanced workers spread to every corner of the city. After discussion between the directors and cinematographers, a filming team was immediately established and divided into four groups, rushing to the scene for interviews and filming.

    This documentary film was also shot with the support of all sides. The masses regarded participating in the filming work as an encouragement from the Party and a kind of honor. On the day of filming at the Huairou Reservoir, work efficiency increased by 30%. County Party Secretary Li Xiaozhang said: "Filming is a spur and encouragement to us!" Similarly, the soaring fighting spirit of the workers and peasants, in turn, inspired every filmmaker to muster even greater revolutionary enthusiasm. When the workers proposed "seizing high yields during production time and engaging in innovation during rest time," the filmmakers also broke with convention. In factories, rural areas, or construction sites, directors and cinematographers often used lunch breaks and the lighting workers' intervals for adjusting the lights to plan the next battle. The workers' and peasants' enthusiasm inspired the filmmakers to cross mountains and ridges to the Great Wall at Gubeikou, filming the moving scenes of the bird-dropping fertilizer collection team stretching for dozens of miles. It also encouraged Gao Hongtao, an elderly cinematographer in his late fifties, to climb cloud ladders six or seven stories high, holding the camera, to film a panoramic view of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant.

    However, the wheel of the times turned too fast, and despite their best efforts to keep up, they sometimes inevitably became "wise after the event." The directors of this film gave such an example: they visited the last process of electronic tube production in the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory—the inspection work. The girls sat upright at their workbenches, tapping the electronic tubes with their hands, picking out the unqualified tubes, which was both laborious and time-consuming. With the tide of technical innovation, a semi-automatic inspection machine was born. The directors and cinematographers were satisfied and captured it on film. A few days later, when they went to do additional shooting, they found that the original machine had been replaced by a fully automated inspection machine. The shots in the film could not be linked together, so they had to reshoot. The directors were also deeply touched. After they finished filming the semi-automatic spreaders and cranes replacing manual labor at the Fengtai and Guang'anmen stations, just as they were about to leave the scene, they discovered that even the relatively light labor of switching railway points and opening and closing car doors had also been electrified.

    In filming this documentary, they paid attention to using the method of contrast, so that the audience could vividly see the tremendous power of technical innovation. In the electroplating grid workshop of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, a girl tapped a small part in the electronic tube with a small stick, and had to tap it three times a minute, otherwise it would become a waste product, what a drowsy work! A young worker became interested in a toy that automatically beat a drum for a small doll. When he installed this toy on the machine, the girl's nimble hands were freed. The audience could not help but laugh. As the pictures turned one by one, greenhouses full of cucumbers appeared on the screen. Li Molin, a national model worker in agriculture, after picking cucumbers, was also cultivating seedlings in small pots, and then he enthusiastically told the agricultural university students: "The future greenhouse will be tall and big, and tractors will also be driven in to cultivate here..." In such a short space, the film not only introduced advanced greenhouse technology, but also portrayed the lofty ideals of heroic figures, leaving a deep impression on the audience.

    The timely filming and screening of "The Red Flag Flying" effectively reflected the current political struggle and central movement. In the filming process, it promoted the filmmakers to go deep into the struggle of the masses; it also enabled the creators to discover more educational subjects. In the continuous great leap forward of the people of the whole country, let the film art better serve the workers, peasants and soldiers, and let the Mao Zedong red flag fly forever!

    让红旗永远飘扬
    大型纪录片“红旗飘扬”拍摄记
    继功
    最近人们在欣赏“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”这部优秀影片时，以同样激奋的心情观看了“红旗飘扬”。从4月2日到11日的统计，北京市的观众已达五十三万人次。这显示了我们的艺术如能同时代的脉搏紧密结合起来，是会受到广大人民的欢迎的。
    在六十多分钟的放映时间中，观众如亲临其境地在机器旁、高炉前、矿井下、建筑工地上，看到了“革新花朵处处红，生产纪录日日新”的生动情景，影片也充分显示了首都工农业建设的巨大变化。
    北京电影制片厂摄制这样一部大型纪录片还是第一次。他们以“红心唱红旗”的壮志，在十六个工作日里抢拍出来。今年2月份，北京技术革命运动风起云涌，全市工业战线群英会在跃进战报频传中开幕。北影党委根据上级指示要把这些鼓舞人心的先进事迹及时反映出来，摄制工作者也深受鼓舞，纷纷向党保证：在不影响原有的摄制任务以外，增产一部纪录片，让先进工作者点起的技术革命火焰燃遍全市各个角落。导演、摄影师共同讨论后，立即成立了摄制组，并分作四个方面，奔赴现场进行采访和拍摄。
    这部纪录电影也是在八方支援下拍摄的。群众把参加拍摄工作看成是党对他们的鼓励，是一种荣誉。怀柔水库的民工在拍电影的当天，工效提高了30％。县委书记李晓章说：“拍电影是对咱们的督促和鼓励啊！”同样，工农群众的昂扬斗志，反转来也使每一个摄制人员鼓起更大的革命干劲。当工人们提出“生产时间夺高产，休息时间搞革新”以后，摄制人员也打破常规。在工厂、农村或建筑工地，导演和摄影师往往乘午间休息、照明工人调度灯光的间隙，部署下一个战役。工人、农民的干劲，鼓舞着摄制人员翻山越岭，到古北口的长城上，拍摄延绵几十里长的鸟粪积肥队的动人场面；它也鼓舞着年近五十的老摄影师高洪涛不辞辛劳地抱着摄影机攀登上六七层楼高的云梯，拍摄石钢全景。
    可是时代的车轮转得太快了，尽管他们紧拍紧赶，有时仍不免落为“马后炮”。这部影片的导演们举出了这样一件事例：他们在北京电子管厂参观了生产电子管的最后一道工序——检验工作，姑娘们端坐在工作台前，用手敲打着电子管，把不合格的管子挑出来，这样既费力又费时间。随着技术革新的浪潮，一种半自动化检验机诞生了。导演和摄影师们满意地把它摄入了镜头。过了几天，他们再去补拍时，发现原来的机器已经为完全自动化的检验机所代替了。影片的画面前后衔接不上，不得不重新拍摄。导演们也深有所感，当他们在丰台、广安门车站拍完半自动化吊具和起重机，代替肩挑手抬的场面以后，刚要离开现场，发现原先搬道叉、开关车门等比较轻微的劳动，也都改为电气化了。
    在拍摄这个纪录影片中，他们注意了运用对比的手法，使观众形象地看到技术革新的巨大威力。在北京电子管厂的电度栅极车间，一位姑娘用一根小棒敲打着电子管中的一个小零件，一分钟必须打三次，不然就会成废品，多么令人瞌睡的工作啊！一个青年工人对一个小娃娃自动打鼓的玩具发生了兴趣，当他把这个玩具安装在机器上，姑娘灵巧的手就被解放了。观众禁不住哄笑起来。随着画面一个个的转动，银幕上出现了黄瓜满藤的暖房，全国农业劳动模范李墨林摘完黄瓜，又在小盆内育果苗，接着他给农业大学学生眉飞色舞地讲起来了：“将来的温室又高又大，拖拉机也要开进来，在这里耕作……”在这样短短的篇幅里，影片既介绍了温室先进技术，也刻划了英雄人物的远大理想，给观众留下了深刻的印象。
    “红旗飘扬”及时地摄成和上映，有效地反映了当前的政治斗争和中心运动。在拍摄过程中，促进了电影工作者深入到群众的斗争中去；同时也使创作人员发现了更多富有教育意义的题材。在全国人民持续不断的大跃进声中，让电影艺术更好地为工农兵服务，让毛泽东红旗永远飘扬下去！
