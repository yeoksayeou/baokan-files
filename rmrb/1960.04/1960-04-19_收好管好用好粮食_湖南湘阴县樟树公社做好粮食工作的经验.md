Properly collect, manage, and use grain is the central link in organizing the people's economic life. The Zhangshu People's Commune in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, has created a complete set of experiences in this regard.

In 1959, the Zhangshu Commune overcame an extraordinary drought and achieved a great agricultural harvest, with total grain output increasing by 15% compared to 1958. The great grain harvest changed the historical face of grain shortage and transformed it from insufficiency to surplus. In grain distribution, based on the principle of "taking into account the state, the collective, and the individual," the annual state procurement task of 6.49 million catties was completed, an increase of 38.3% compared to 1958. After reserving enough rations, seeds, and feed, there were still 560,000 catties of reserve grain (not including the spring harvest). In grain management, a "four unified" (unified storage, unified arrangement, unified processing, unified system) and "one fixed" (fixed personnel management) management system was implemented to twist the collection, management, and use of grain into one rope. The commune established 69 warehouses, and the stored grain was well-kept. Ration quotas were distributed to households after the autumn harvest, and with the canteens as the focus, the people's economic life was actively organized, and vegetable production was vigorously promoted, with each person eating more than two catties of vegetables per day, and some eating up to five catties. A large amount of dried and pickled vegetables were also stored to diversify the variety of food and ensure that planned grain consumption was fully achieved. 85% of the canteens and 80% of the households had grain surpluses. From last year to the end of February this year, a total of 820,000 catties of grain were saved, an average of 16 catties per person. The broad masses of commune members were all jubilant and enthusiastic.

The Zhangshu Commune was able to do an excellent job in grain work mainly because, under the leadership of the Party, it implemented the "four unified and one fixed" management system based on the principle of "centralized and unified grain management," linking the collection, management, and use of grain, and actively organizing the people's economic life.

For the past two years, the commune has adhered to the "four unified and one fixed" management system. This system is adapted to the current form of basic ownership by the production brigade. Its basic spirit is to concentrate grain power in the production brigade, which is convenient for implementing the principles of "unified management, physical distribution to the hall, quantitative allocation per person, quotas to households, and savings belonging to oneself." Concentrating grain power can accurately grasp grain production, ensure the completion of state procurement tasks, reasonably allocate grain, arrange rations, seeds, feed, and other grain needs, and promote the development of large-scale collective production. It can better implement planned grain consumption and ensure that the masses eat their fill and eat well.

Their specific practices are:

First, in terms of collection. While doing a good job in careful harvesting and returning every grain to the home, they firmly grasped warehousing and reporting. Before last summer's harvest, they actively trained more than 2,800 people as grain drying, acceptance, and tally personnel, formulated a warehousing and reporting system, and seized the harvest season of early, mid, and late rice, adhering to the "five simultaneous" method of "collecting, drying, sorting, quality checking, and warehousing," ensuring that the grain dried on the same day was warehoused on the same day, and that production teams and work groups did not leave grain overnight. From the fields to the threshing grounds, and from the threshing grounds to the warehouses, they carried out plot registration, weighing and checking, and a three-way warehousing and reporting system. During the harvest process, the Party committee also divided areas and assigned responsibilities to specifically control the acceptance work. The first batch of grain warehoused after the annual production reached 99.4% of the total output, achieving a one-time clear warehousing. This laid a good foundation for verifying output, verifying inventory, arranging living, and distributing ration quotas to households as soon as possible.

Second, in terms of management. A method of centralized warehouse construction was implemented with the brigade as the unit. Based on collective production, collective consumption, regional, transportation, living conditions, and the long-term plans of new villages, the layout and size of the warehouses were planned. Based on the principles of "making do with what is available, using local materials, and self-reliance," the original 1,320 warehouses were rebuilt and expanded into 63 by using ancestral halls, temples, and civilian houses. The appropriate concentration of warehouses has brought many benefits to grain management:

    1.  Effectively concentrating grain management authority in the production brigade;
    2.  Making grain management work completely institutionalized;
    3.  Preventing losses caused by insects, mold, rats, and birds due to centralized storage;
    4.  Facilitating unified grain processing, which can save processing labor; the rice yield has also generally increased; a large amount of unified bran has been produced, opening up a source of feed.

Third, in terms of use. As soon as the autumn harvest was completed last year, the Zhangshu Commune, in accordance with the principles of "looking ahead and behind, supplementing deficiencies with surpluses, long-term planning, leaving room for maneuver" and "producing ten parts and arranging eight parts," distributed the annual ration quota to households at one time, and arranged it by season and distributed grain to the canteens by month. With the canteen as the unit, the amount was determined per person through democratic appraisal. While the quota was distributed to households, the accounts were explained to the masses so that they knew their small grain accounts and the big accounts of the brigade's grain arrangement. The masses were organized to discuss and formulate grain consumption plans, consciously adhere to planned and economical grain consumption, and implement collective life and collective management, achieving "eating more when busy, eating less when idle, eating dry and thin, and eating grain mixed with vegetables." In order to strengthen canteen management, management committees were established in all 739 canteens in the commune to regularly study and improve canteen work, establish canteen management systems, regularly carry out publicity and education on planned and economical grain consumption, and check the grain consumption of commune members at any time to grasp changes in population growth and decrease. In order to comprehensively organize the people's economic life, the commune Party committee required cadres sent to the work groups to be responsible for running a canteen well, grasping both production and life. The grain department also actively imparted rice cooking skills through running spare-time schools to ensure that there were many varieties of food and the taste was good. The new method of cooking was also promoted, increasing the output of rice. At the same time, it also helped the canteen carry out the reform of cooking utensils, realizing the mechanization of rice washing, vegetable washing, and vegetable cutting, the aerial cableway transportation of meals, and the improvement of stove types, which was both clean and hygienic, and saved labor and fuel. It also helped the canteen organize special personnel to cut and dry firewood, and for the five brigades along the river that lacked firewood, it helped store enough coal. In order to improve life and save grain, vegetable production was also vigorously promoted as soon as the autumn harvest ended last year, so that each canteen had professional vegetable growing labor, and the commune had more than 15,000 mu of permanent vegetable fields and used riverbank gaps for vegetable growing. Because ideological education was in-depth, the masses paid attention to saving grain. The policy of returning surplus rations to oneself was implemented, and a "surplus grain savings bank" was established (saving surplus grain like deposits, which can be freely withdrawn when grain is needed), which was extremely supported by the masses.

The broad masses of commune members in this commune, because they lived well, were all in a cheerful mood and full of energy. At present, a hot production upsurge is emerging around the spring harvest and spring plowing work.

How did the Zhangshu Commune's grain management work achieve the above results? Their main experience is: Strengthening the Party's leadership over grain work. The commune Party committee attached great importance to grain work, included grain work on the Party committee's regular agenda, and established grain management committees and leading groups at all levels from the commune to the team, with the secretary in command; publicized the Party's grain policy, planned grain consumption, and grain management system to the masses in a big way; relied on the masses to manage the grain well and run the canteens well; and established a evaluation and inspection system to regularly inspect grain work.

    收好管好用好粮食
    ——湖南湘阴县樟树公社做好粮食工作的经验	湖南省粮食厅党组
    把粮食收好、管好、用好，是组织好人民经济生活的中心环节。湖南湘阴县樟树人民公社在这方面创造了成套的经验。
    樟树公社1959年战胜特大旱灾，取得了农业大丰收，粮食总产量比1958年增长15％。粮食的大丰收，改变了历来的缺粮面貌，而且由不足一跃为有余。在粮食分配上，本着“兼顾国家、集体、个人”的原则，全年完成国家征购任务六百四十九万斤，比1958年增加38.3％；除留足口粮、种子、饲料外，尚有储备粮五十六万斤（不包括春收在内）。在粮食管理上，实行了“四统”（统一储存、统一安排、统一加工、统一制度）、“一定”（固定专人管理）的管理制度，把收、管、用拧成一股绳。全社设仓六十九处，库存粮食保管得很好；口粮指标秋后就到户，并以食堂为重点，积极组织人民经济生活，大抓蔬菜生产，每人每天吃菜二斤以上，多的吃到五斤，并储备了大量的干腌菜，做到饭菜品种多样化，计划用粮满堂红，85％的食堂和80％的户有粮食节余，从去年到今年2月底，共节余粮食八十二万斤，平均每人节余十六斤，广大社员无不欢欣鼓舞，干劲冲天。
    樟树公社能够出色地做好粮食工作，主要是在党的领导下，根据“粮食集中统一管理”的原则，实行了“四统一定”的管理制度，把粮食的收、管、用环环扣紧，同时积极组织好人民经济生活。
    这个公社两年来，一直坚持了“四统一定”的管理制度。这一制度是适应目前生产大队基本所有制的形式的。它的基本精神，就是把粮权集中到生产大队，便于贯彻“统一管理、实物到堂、以人定量、指标到户、节约归己”的原则。粮权集中就可以正确掌握粮食产量，保证国家征购任务的完成；可以合理分配粮食，安排好口粮、种子、饲料及其他用粮需要，促进大规模集体生产的发展；可以更好地实行粮食计划消费，保证群众吃饱吃好。
      他们的具体做法是：
    第一、收的方面。在做好细打细收、颗粒还家的
  同时，紧紧抓住了入库报解。去年夏收以前，就积极训练晒谷、验收、记码员二千八百多人，制订了验收报解入库制度，抓住早、中、晚稻的收获季节，坚持
  “边收、边晒、边整理、边验质、边入库”的“五边”办法，做到当天晒干的粮食当天入库，生产队、作业组不留粮过夜。从田间到晒谷坪、从晒谷坪到仓库，都进行了分丘登记、检斤过秤和三联入库报解制度。在收获过程中，党委又分片包干，具体掌握验收工作。全年生产的粮食，在收割后首批入库量就达到总产量的99.4％，做到入库一次清。这就为核实产量、核实库存、安排生活、及早把口粮指标分配到户，打下了良好基础。
    第二、管的方面。实行了以大队为单位集中建仓的办法，根据集体生产、集体消费和地区、交通、居住条件以及新村远景规划等情况，规划了仓库的摆布和大小；本着“因陋就简、就地取材、自力更生”的原则，利用祠堂、庙宇、民房，把原有一千三百二十处仓库，改建、扩建为六十三处。由于仓库的适当集中，就给粮食管理带来了很多好处：
    1、切实把粮食管理权限集中到生产大队；
    2、使粮食管理工作完全走上了制度化；
    3、由于集中保管，防止了虫、霉、鼠、雀造成的损失；
    4、便于粮食统一加工，可以节省加工劳动力；出米率也普遍提高；增产大量统糠，开辟了饲料来源。
    第三、用的方面。去年秋收刚一完毕，樟树公社按照“瞻前顾后、以丰补欠、细水长流、留有余地”和“生产十分、安排八分”的原则，把全年口粮指标一次到户，同时分季安排，分月发粮到食堂，并以食堂为单位，通过民主评议，依人定量。在指标到户的同时，即向群众算账交底，让群众知道自己吃粮的小底子，也知道大队安排用粮的大底子，并组织群众讨论，制订用粮计划，自觉地坚持计划用粮节约用粮，实行集体生活、集体当家，做到“忙时多吃、闲时少吃、有干有稀、粮菜混吃”。为了加强食堂管理，全社七百三十九个食堂都成立了管理委员会，经常研究改进食堂工作，建立了食堂管理制度，经常开展计划用粮节约用粮的宣传教育，随时检查社员用粮情况，掌握人口增减变化。为了全面地组织好人民经济生活，公社党委要求下到作业组的干部，每人包干办好一个食堂，既要抓好生产，又要抓好生活。粮食部门还通过办业余学校，积极传授饭菜烹调技术，做到饭菜品种多、味道好；并推广了新法作饭，提高了出饭量；同时还帮助食堂进行了炊具改革，实现了淘米、洗菜、切菜机械化，运送饭菜空中索道化，灶型改良化，这样既清洁卫生，又节省劳力和燃料；还帮助食堂组织专人砍晒烧柴，对沿江缺柴的五个大队，则帮助储足了烧煤；为了既改善生活又节约粮食，去年秋收刚一结束，还大抓了蔬菜生产，使每个食堂都有专业种菜劳力，全社常年菜地和利用河洲隙地种菜达一万五千余亩。由于思想教育深入，群众都注意节约粮食；贯彻执行口粮节余归己的政策，又创办了“余粮储蓄所”（像存款一样储存余粮，需用粮食时可自由提取），这种办法群众极为拥护。
    这个社的广大社员，由于生活过的好，个个心情舒畅干劲冲天。目前正围绕着春收春耕工作，出现了一个热火朝天的生产大高潮。
    樟树公社的粮食管理工作是怎样取得以上成绩的呢？他们主要的经验是：加强了党对粮食工作的领导。公社党委对粮食工作非常重视，把粮食工作列入了党委经常议事日程，从社到队，都是书记挂帅，层层建立了粮食管理委员会和领导小组；向群众大张旗鼓地宣传党的粮食政策、计划用粮和粮食管理制度；依靠群众把粮食管好、把食堂办好；建立了评比检查制度，经常检查粮食工作。
