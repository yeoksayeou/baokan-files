    Yunnan Bajie Iron Mine Achieves Major Innovation
    Large-Scale Blasting Increases Mining Output
    Yibin's Indigenous Sugar Refineries Set National Sugar Extraction Rate Record
    Workers at the Kunming Iron and Steel Company's Bajie Iron Mine successfully tested "directional throwing" large-scale blasting, fundamentally reversing the situation where excavation could not keep up with mining needs, and mining was not adapted to iron smelting. During the first large-scale blasting stripping test using explosives at this mine, a total of 31,000 cubic meters of earth and rock were blasted, equivalent to 10,000 workdays of excavation, obtaining 40,000 tons of prepared ore in one blast. This blasting flattened a mountain, and after clearing the earth and rock, hundreds of thousands of tons of ore will be exposed.
    Workers at the Tianchi People's Commune Four-Roller Sugar Factory in Yibin City, Sichuan Province, in order to use less raw materials and produce more sugar, comprehensively innovated sugar cane preparation, juice extraction, sugar boiling, coal burning, and other sugar production techniques and tools, achieving a sugar extraction rate of 26.9% (the general sugar extraction rate of indigenous sugar refineries is only 10%), creating the highest sugar extraction rate level among indigenous sugar refineries nationwide.
    After the 21 sugar factories in Yibin City learned from their experience, the average sugar extraction rate has reached 18.2%. Currently, indigenous sugar refineries in many parts of the country are also learning from their experience.

    云南八街铁矿实现重大革新
    大爆破采矿多
    宜宾土糖坊出糖率创全国纪录
    昆明钢铁公司八街铁矿职工试验“定向抛掷”大爆破成功，根本扭转了掘进赶不上采矿需要、采矿与炼铁不相适应的局面。这个矿用炸药试验第一次大爆破剥离时，共爆下相当于一万个工作日才能开掘的三万一千立方米土石，一次就获得了四万吨备采矿量。这次爆破削平了一座山，将使几十万吨矿石在清除土石后露出地面。
    四川宜宾市天池人民公社四辊糖厂职工，为了少用原料，多出糖，全面革新了办料、榨糖、熬糖、烧煤等榨糖操作技术和工具，使出糖率达到26.9％（一般土糖坊出糖率只达10％），创造了全国土糖坊出糖率最高水平。
    宜宾全市二十一家糖厂学习了他们的经验以后，平均出糖率已达到18.2％。现在，全国很多地方的土糖坊也都在学习他们的经验。
