    Breaking Superstition and Liberating Thought
    Rapid Production Development in Liuchuan People's Commune

    (Reported by our newspaper) Under the leadership of the Party, members of all ethnic groups in the Liuchuan People's Commune in Jianhe County have brought into play the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune, eliminated various customs that hinder production, rapidly developed production, and changed their backward conditions.

    The vast majority of members of the Liuchuan People's Commune are of the Miao ethnic group. Before liberation, the economy and culture were very backward. Most areas used wooden farm tools and adopted cultivation methods such as human-pulled plows, "foot-treaded fields," and "slash-and-burn." The average annual income per person was only about 11 yuan in RMB. After liberation, with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the poor and backward conditions gradually changed. However, due to the original poor foundation and the fact that various backward customs had not been eradicated, the speed of production development was still relatively slow. After the establishment of the people's commune, the mountainous areas took on a new look through adjusting cultivated land, vigorously developing water conservancy, transforming barren and thin land, and promoting advanced technology. In 1959, the total income of the entire commune increased more than four times compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The total grain output increased by 155.9% compared to 1958, and the yield per unit area reached 1,301 jin. The average person had more than 2,000 jin of grain. Various productions such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery have also achieved rapid development, and commune-run industries have been established. The total income of the members has increased more than tenfold compared to before liberation.

    Breaking superstition, liberating thought, and eliminating the influence of "seedling leaders" and "ghost masters" are important reasons for the leap-forward development of production in the Liuchuan Commune. In the past, Miao villages all had "seedling leaders" and "ghost masters." They were either clan elders or village elders. In production, they did not do anything, and no one could preempt them. During the period of agricultural cooperatives, although "slash-and-burn" cultivation and wooden farm tools had disappeared in the Liuchuan area, the influence of these "seedling leaders," "ghost masters," and some old habits on production was still significant. Many backward farming methods, such as shallow plowing, rough work, and not planting small seasons, had not been fundamentally changed. Until 1957, the Miao farmers here had not grown wheat. After the establishment of the commune, the Party's political and ideological work was greatly strengthened, and Party members, Youth League members, and activists gradually established the idea that "man can conquer nature" and dared to carry out reforms boldly. In addition, the Party organization carried out patient persuasion and mobilization of Miao commune members, and Han commune members provided certain technical assistance. In the autumn of 1958, the entire commune planted 1,761 mu of wheat and rapeseed for the first time, and achieved a bumper harvest. This fact made the broad masses of Miao commune members further realize the importance of accepting advanced experience. After the autumn harvest in 1959, the entire commune sowed more than 25,000 mu of wheat and rapeseed, an increase of thirteen times compared to 1958. Currently, the seedlings are growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

    The development of production has also promoted the development of culture. In the past, it was difficult to find a literate person among thousands of households here. Now, the entire commune has 33 junior high schools, complete primary schools, and elementary schools, with more than 3,100 students. Through literacy campaigns, about 40% of young adults can recognize more than 1,000 characters. The entire commune has also established a hospital, five health clinics, and three health stations, and each production team has a midwife.

### 破除迷信　解放思想  柳川人民公社生产迅速发展

    破除迷信　解放思想
    柳川人民公社生产迅速发展
    本报讯　剑河县柳川人民公社各族社员，在党的领导下，发挥了人民公社的无比优越性，革除了各种妨碍生产的风俗习惯，迅速地发展了生产，改变了落后面貌。
    柳川人民公社的社员绝大部分是苗族。解放前经济、文化都很落后，大部分地区使用木质农具，采用人拉犁、“脚踩田”和“刀耕火种”的耕作方法。每人每年平均收入仅合人民币十一元左右。解放后，随着互助合作运动的发展，贫穷落后面貌逐渐改变。但是由于原来的基础太差，种种落后的风俗习惯尚未根除，生产发展速度还是较慢。人民公社成立后，经过调整耕地、大兴水利、改造瘦田薄地和推广先进技术，山区面目焕然一新。1959年全社总收入比大跃进的1958年增加四倍以上。粮食总产量较1958年增长155.9％，单位面积产量达到一千三百零一斤。每人平均有粮两千斤以上。林牧副渔等各项生产也得到了飞跃的发展，并且建立了公社工业。社员的总收入比解放前增加十倍以上。
    破除迷信，解放思想，消除“秧头”、“鬼师”的影响，是柳川公社生产飞跃发展的一个重要原因。过去，苗族村寨都有“秧头”和“鬼师”，他们不是族佬就是寨佬，在生产上，他们不动手，任何人不能抢先。农业社时期，柳川一带“刀耕火种”和木质农具虽然绝迹了，但这些“秧头”、“鬼师”和一些旧的习惯对生产的影响还很大，许多落后的耕作方法，如浅耕、粗作以及不种小季等，都未得到根本改变，直到1957年，这里的苗族农民还没有种过小麦。公社建立后，党的政治思想工作大大加强，党团员和积极分子逐步树立了“人定胜天”的思想，敢于大胆地进行改革。加上党组织对苗族社员进行了耐心的说服动员，汉族社员在技术上给予一定的帮助，1958年秋后全社破天荒地种下小麦和油菜一千七百六十一亩，并且获得了丰收。这一事实，使广大苗族社员进一步认识到接受先进经验的重要。1959年秋收后，全社共播种小麦、油菜二万五千多亩，比1958年扩大了十三倍。目前禾苗生长良好，丰收在望。
    生产的发展也促进了文化的发展。过去，这里成千户人家中难找到一个识字的人，现在全社已有了初中、完小和初小三十三所，在校学生达三千一百多人。通过扫盲，40％左右的青壮年都能识一千多个字。全社还建立了一所医院、五个卫生所、三个保健站，每个生产队都有了接生员。
