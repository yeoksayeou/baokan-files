    Beijing Garment Factory Enthusiastically and Proactively Disseminates Innovation Achievements
    Turning Advanced Experience into the Wealth of the Entire Industry
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The workers of the state-owned Beijing Garment Factory are helping others with full enthusiasm, trying every possible means to turn their advanced experience into the common wealth of the national industry as soon as possible.
    In the past year or so, this factory has successively launched nine mass technical innovation and technical revolution upsurges, basically realizing the mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation of production throughout the factory. Production efficiency has increased several times. In the technical innovation movement, everyone in the factory, from leading cadres to every worker, regards every achievement in technical innovation as the wealth of the entire society. Once a new invention or creation is made, they try every means to spread it to brother factories in the same industry; for those who come to visit, they select the best workers to explain and demonstrate, and sometimes even teach them hand-in-hand until the visitors learn. From August last year to now, in more than half a year, they have disseminated more than 100 advanced experiences in various aspects of production, such as tailoring, sewing, cotton carding, as well as the manufacture of advanced tools and production management, to more than 200 garment factories in the city and in places far from the capital, such as Urumqi, Jiamusi, Yunnan, and Qinghai. This has greatly increased the production efficiency of these factories and saved a lot of cotton cloth. At the same time, they have also trained many technical talents for hundreds of brother factories and produced more than 1,500 pieces of advanced machinery and equipment. Many brother factories have given extremely high praise to their noble style of caring for others, enabling everyone to improve and leap forward together.
    In the technical innovation movement, the fact that brother factories enthusiastically helped them has greatly educated the workers of this factory. Leading cadres, engineering technicians, and workers from garment factories in Chengdu, Hankou, Shijiazhuang and other places personally brought drawings or models of advanced tools to this factory to impart experience. Most of the semi-automatic machines and tools that have been successfully innovated have absorbed the advanced experience of brother factories or received direct help from brother factories. The workers deeply realized that every technical innovation achievement is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of many enterprise workers and is everyone's common wealth. Making this wealth quickly mastered by the workers of brother factories has become the enthusiastic desire of all the workers in the factory. They said: "In our socialist society, new inventions and new creations are the wealth of the whole people, not private property. It is our responsibility and our obligation to tell all of it to brother factories."
    Under the guidance of this idea, the factory adopted a series of effective measures to ensure that all the experience it has gained is imparted to brother factories. First, the Party committee often conducts ideological education of "the whole country as one chessboard" for all workers in the factory, establishes pacesetters with good cooperation and high style in the factory, and forms a mass movement to learn from and catch up with the pacesetters. Second, they warmly receive representatives from brother factories, and under the principle of not affecting production, they assign special personnel to explain and demonstrate, and try to draw advanced technical drawings and manufacture advanced tools, and let the representatives of brother factories take them away after deducting the cost. Third, under the unified organization and leadership of the higher-level competent departments, after proper arrangement of production, outstanding workers and technicians are transferred to form advanced experience promotion teams to visit factories and communes in the same industry to impart "scripture" and deliver "treasure", explain technology, repair machines, and help solve key production problems. The advanced tailoring experience promotion team traveled all over the thirteen major garment factories and communes in Beijing last winter, helping them solve more than 140 key production problems, which generally increased the tailoring efficiency of these factories and communes by one or two times and saved a lot of cotton cloth. Fourth, according to the large number of learning units and the wide range of content, various forms of cooperation projects are incorporated into production plans and work plans, and implemented to workshops, groups, and individuals at all levels. Fifth, under the organization and leadership of relevant departments, they actively signed contracts with brother factories for guaranteed teaching and learning. In the implementation of the contract, people, time, quality, and quantity are fixed to ensure fast teaching and good learning. Now, 59 advanced machines and experiences have taken root in more than 60 factories and communes in Beijing through various contracts.
    In the process of actively imparting advanced experience to others, all the workers in the factory are not proud or complacent, but teach and learn at the same time. Therefore, new inventions and creations continue to emerge, and the original various advanced experiences have also been further improved and developed. The factory's production is booming. Last year, the annual production plan was fully completed 34 days ahead of schedule. This year, it has leaped forward at a greater pace, and completed the first quarter's plan for output, quality, cost, and labor productivity fully six days ahead of schedule. The first-class product rate of major products reached more than 99%.

    北京被服厂热情主动地传播革新成果
    让先进经验变成全行业财富
    本报讯　国营北京被服厂职工满腔热情地帮助别人，千方百计地把自己的先进经验尽快地变成全国同行业的共同财富。
    这个工厂在过去一年多的时间中，已连续掀起了九次群众性的技术革新和技术革命高潮，全厂基本上实现了生产机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化，生产效率成倍增长。在技术革新运动中，全厂从领导干部到每个工人，都把技术革新的每一项成就看做全社会的财富。一旦有了新的发明创造，就想尽一切办法向同行业的兄弟工厂传播；对登门拜访者，他们选择最优秀的工人给讲解、表演，有时还把着手教，直到访问者学会为止。从去年8月到现在半年多的时间内，他们把生产中的剪裁、缝纫、弹花以及先进工具的制造和生产管理等各方面的一百多项先进经验，向本市和远离首都的乌鲁木齐、佳木斯、云南、青海等地两百多个被服工厂作了传播，使这些工厂的生产效率也有很大增长，节约了大量棉布。同时，他们还为数以百计的兄弟工厂培训了许多技术人材，制作了一千五百多件先进机具设备。很多兄弟工厂对他们这种关心别人，使大家共同提高共同跃进的高尚风格，给予了极高的评价。
    在技术革新运动中，兄弟厂对他们热情帮助的事实，曾使这个工厂的职工受到了极大的教育。成都、汉口、石家庄等地被服工厂的领导干部、工程技术人员和工人，就亲自拿着先进工具的图样或模型，到这个工厂来传授经验。在已经革新成功的绝大部分半自动化机械和工具中，都吸取了兄弟厂的先进经验或得到兄弟工厂的直接帮助。职工们深刻地体会到，每一项技术革新成就，都是很多企业职工们集体智慧的结晶，是大家的共同财富。使这种财富很快为兄弟工厂的职工所掌握，成了全厂职工的热烈愿望。他们说：“在我们社会主义社会里，新发明，新创造，是全民财富，不是私有财产。把它全部告诉给兄弟工厂，是我们的责任，也是我们的义务。”
    在这种思想指导下，这个工厂采取了一系列有效措施，保证向兄弟工厂传授自己所已经取得的全部经验。首先，党委经常向全厂职工进行“全国一盘棋”的思想教育，在厂内树立协作好、风格高的标兵，并且形成学标兵、赶标兵的群众运动。第二，热情接待兄弟工厂代表，在不影响生产的原则下，抽出专人给讲解、表演，并尽可能绘制先进技术图纸，制造先进工具，在折收成本费后让兄弟工厂代表带走。第三，在上级主管部门的统一组织领导下，经过对生产的妥善安排，抽调优秀工人和技术员组成先进经验推广队，到同行业厂、社登门传“经”送“宝”，讲解技术，修理机器，帮助解决生产关键问题。先进裁剪经验推广队去冬就跑遍北京十三个主要被服厂、社，帮助他们解决生产关键一百四十多项，使这些厂社的裁剪效率也普遍提高一、两倍，并节约了大量棉布。第四，根据学习单位多、内容广的情况，把各种形式的协作项目，订入生产计划和工作计划，并逐级落实到车间、小组和个人。第五，在有关部门组织领导下，主动和兄弟厂签订包教包学合同。在执行合同中，定人、定时、定质、保量，做到了教得快，学得好。现在已有五十九项先进机具和经验，通过各种合同在北京市六十多个厂、社开花结果。
    这个工厂在积极向别人传授先进经验的过程中，全厂职工不骄傲，不自满，又传又学，因此，新的发明创造不断涌现，原来的各种先进经验也得到了进一步的提高和发展。全厂生产蒸蒸日上。去年提前三十四天全面完成全年生产计划。今年来又以更大的步伐向前跃进，提前六天全面完成产量、质量、成本、劳动生产率的首季计划，主要产品的一级品率达到99％以上。
