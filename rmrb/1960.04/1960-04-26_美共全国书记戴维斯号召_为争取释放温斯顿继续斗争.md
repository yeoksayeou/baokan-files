Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, April 25th. Benjamin Davis, National Secretary of the Communist Party USA, has called for continued struggle to secure the release of American Communist leader Henry Winston.

Davis pointed out that due to tremendous pressure from the masses, Winston has been transferred to the U.S. National Hospital on Staten Island. However, the U.S. government is fundamentally opposed to this transfer.

Davis said that it is clearly a major victory to prevent Henry Winston from being transferred back to the Springfield Federal Prison in Missouri, but without a doubt, the Eisenhower government hopes to hide him now, so that people neither see him nor remember him.

Davis emphasized that the main task remains to strive for the immediate and complete release of Winston through bail for medical treatment or administrative pardon.

    美共全国书记戴维斯号召
    为争取释放温斯顿继续斗争
    据新华社日内瓦25日电　美国共产党全国书记本杰明·戴维斯号召继续为争取释放美国共产党领袖亨利·温斯顿而斗争。
    戴维斯指出，由于群众的巨大压力，温斯顿已经被迁移到斯塔腾岛上的美国国立医院。但是美国政府根本反对这种迁移。
    戴维斯说，显然这是阻止把亨利·温斯顿迁回密苏里州斯普林菲尔德联邦监狱的重大胜利，但是，毫无疑问，艾森豪威尔政府希望现在把他藏起来，使人们既看不见他，也想不起他来。
    戴维斯强调说，主要任务仍然是争取通过保释就医或者行政上的赦免，立即完全释放温斯顿。
