Technical Revolution in Full Bloom

    Workers at the Hailar Leather Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Inner Mongolia, manufactured, modified, and expanded machines for combined wool carding and laying, shrinking, double pressing, and rubbing felt boots, thus realizing the mechanization of manual felt boot production. Raw wool is fed into a combined carding and laying machine that both cards the wool and lays it into a felt, almost instantly. It then goes through another machine and becomes a felt sheet. At this time, the workers fold the felt sheet into the shape of a boot and send it to rotating machines like the large reeling machine, shrinking machine, and double pressing machine. As a result, pairs of sturdy and beautiful felt boots are produced. The entire production process is three to five times more efficient than manual production. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    生产毡靴用机器
    内蒙古地方国营海拉尔皮革厂制造毡靴的工人，自己制造、改装和扩大的弹毛联合铺胎、缩小，双压和擦毡靴等机器，使毡靴生产的手工操作实现了机械化。把原毛送进既能弹毛又能铺胎的联合铺胎机里，瞬间就铺成了胎，再经过另一台机器，就变成毡片。这时工人们把毡片折叠成靴样，送给旋转着的蹂大捆、缩小、双压等机械，于是一双双又结实又美观的毡靴就出来了。整个生产过程比手工生产提高效率三倍到五倍。　（据新华社讯）
