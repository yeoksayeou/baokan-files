Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 national economic plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national financial statement and the 1960 national budget draft. I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee. Not long ago, I participated in the Shanxi-Henan tour organized by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's Cultural and Educational Group. During the tour, I learned a lot, especially gaining a very clear and profound impression of the rapid advancements in our country's socialist construction. Wherever we went, in terms of industrial construction, factories were completed ahead of schedule, put into production ahead of schedule, and overfulfilled their tasks, and all were continuing to expand. Whether it was a modern large factory or a small factory originally based on manual operations, all were vigorously engaged in technological revolution, achieving remarkable results. In rural areas, agricultural production, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, as well as cultural activities, sports, and hygiene, formed an all-round leap forward and were blossoming everywhere, demonstrating the new face of socialist rural areas. In education, the Party's education policy is being implemented, and teaching and research are combined with productive labor. Everywhere one could see that whether it was the production of material wealth or people's mental outlook, everything was thriving, a completely new atmosphere, which was truly exciting. This is the victory of the General Line, the victory of the Great Leap Forward, the victory of the People's Communes, and ultimately the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Because I gained such a clear and profound perceptual understanding during this tour, I felt very concrete and intimate when I heard the reports of the two vice premiers.

    Using the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet to Eliminate Illiteracy Can Be Done More, Faster, Better, and More Economically

    Now I would like to talk about my impressions of the effectiveness of using the Chinese phonetic alphabet to eliminate illiteracy that I saw in the rural areas of southern Shanxi. Illiteracy elimination work has been actively carried out since 1949 and has achieved certain results, but there is one key problem that has not been well resolved, and that is the problem of "relapse." Many people who graduate from literacy classes forget the characters they learned after a while. Of the 1,500 characters they know, only 300, 500, or even fewer are remembered. After "breaking free from illiteracy," they "relapse into illiteracy." This is a very serious problem. Since the National People's Congress passed the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme in February 1958, many places have used the phonetic alphabet as a tool for eliminating illiteracy, which has played a great role in improving the quality of illiteracy elimination and consolidating literacy results. In particular, Wanrong County in Shanxi Province has gained typical experience in this regard.

    According to statistics from October 1958, nearly 34,000 of the more than 30,000 young and middle-aged illiterate people in Wanrong County had originally become literate, but most of them failed to consolidate their knowledge, and one-third of them relapsed into illiteracy. The remaining two-thirds also did not know many characters, and they were unable to read books and newspapers or write articles. After the phonetic alphabet scheme was announced, Wanrong County decided to carry out phonetic literacy work. After pilot experiments and gaining experience, it was promoted throughout the county in November and December 1959. Students first spend 15 to 30 hours learning the Chinese phonetic alphabet, and then spend 100 hours or a little more reading phonetic literacy textbooks and practicing writing. Reading and learning are divided into three stages. The first stage is low speed, learning the most commonly used basic characters and mastering the structure of Chinese characters, and practicing writing. The second stage is medium speed, and the third stage is high speed. In addition to reading the literacy textbook, they also read about ten phonetic reading materials. Practice writing begins in the middle of reading and learning. The first step is to copy books, the second step is to write sentences, and the third step is to write compositions. The three stages of phonetic alphabet, reading, and writing take only 120 to 150 hours to learn 1,500 Chinese characters and reach the standard for literacy graduation. Within two months, Wanrong County eliminated all 13,000-plus illiterate people, and the vast majority entered spare-time junior high school. The students who graduated from the literacy class this time, because they have mastered the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme and can use dictionaries, are not limited by the number of characters they know. They can freely read popular phonetic reading materials in political, cultural, scientific, and technological fields, and they are not afraid of "stumbling blocks" and do not need to ask others for characters. This fundamentally solves the problem of consolidation and improvement after breaking free from illiteracy, and eliminates the phenomenon of relapse into illiteracy. The successful experience of Wanrong County has now been promoted nationwide, and a high tide of "learning from Wanrong and catching up with Wanrong" has been set off everywhere.

    What does the experience of Wanrong County illustrate? It shows that only by using the Chinese phonetic alphabet can the work of eliminating illiteracy be done more, faster, better, and more economically, reflecting the spirit of the General Line. In the past, using only Chinese characters to eliminate illiteracy generally took 300 hours and was not easy to consolidate. Now it takes less than half the time, and it can not only be consolidated, but also facilitates improvement. The most noteworthy point in Wanrong's experience is the emphasis on high-speed and mass reading. Before students have finished learning 1,500 characters, they are allowed to read a large number of phonetic reading materials, and they learn characters while reading. In the early stage of reading teaching, it is "learn characters first, then read books," and in the later stage, it is "read books first, then learn characters," "use familiarity to bring along unfamiliarity, and the more you bring, the more familiar you become; use more to bring along less, and the more you bring, the more you get." Students change from passive to active and can gradually improve themselves without being restricted. This is a valuable experience, but it cannot be done without using the Chinese phonetic alphabet.

    Teaching the Phonetic Alphabet Can Greatly Improve the Quality of Language Teaching

    Learning the phonetic alphabet has also achieved remarkable results in spare-time junior high schools. According to the experience of Wanrong County, the three volumes of language in spare-time junior high schools used to require 240 class hours and generally took two years to learn. After using the phonetic alphabet to improve teaching methods, it only takes 40 to 60 class hours and can be completed in half a year.

    Teaching the phonetic alphabet in ordinary primary schools can also greatly improve the quality of language teaching. (1) Improve the efficiency of learning characters. Students who master the phonetic alphabet learn Chinese characters faster, read them accurately, and remember them firmly. In the final exam of the first grade of Chengguan Primary School in Wanrong County, the average literacy rate reached 95%, while in the past it could only reach 66%. (2) Improved reading ability and reading interest. Students not only read the text much more proficiently than before, but also greatly expanded their extracurricular reading. In the past, middle grades rarely read extracurricular books, but now lower grades are also reading a lot. Elementary school students in Yuncheng County compiled a jingle: "I couldn't spell before, so I was afraid of not knowing the characters, asking the teacher back and forth, and it felt too troublesome. Now if I don't know a character, I can recognize it as soon as I spell it out. There is a lot of knowledge in the book, and it's really interesting." (3) Improved writing level. In the past, students were limited by the number of characters they knew, and they couldn't write down what they wanted to say in their hearts. They either wrote wrong characters, left blanks, or avoided using the sentence, so the composition was very short and the content was very poor. Now that they know more characters and can look up dictionaries, and they can also use phonetic spelling to replace characters they can't find, they can write whatever they want and speak freely. When the fourth-grade students of Nanzhang Primary School in Wanrong County started school last semester, they had not yet learned the phonetic alphabet. General compositions could only write 200 words, with an average of six typos; now they can generally write more than 600 words, with an average of less than two typos. (4) Promoted the learning of other subjects. In the past, because students' language level was poor, other subjects had to spend part of the time explaining words and sentences. Now they can use all the time to talk about the content of the course. At the same time, students' language level has improved, their comprehension has also improved, and learning has become easier.

    From the various facts mentioned above, the role of the phonetic alphabet is truly great. Using the phonetic alphabet to help learn characters, its significance is not only to correct the pronunciation of Chinese characters, nor is it only to prevent forgetting, but more importantly, it gives the key to literacy to illiterate people, allowing them to "learn without a teacher" and forge ahead courageously. This role of the phonetic alphabet has been proven by the experience of Wanrong and many other places. Not only people who did not recognize this point in the past feel very surprised, but even people who originally recognized this point are a little "pleasantly surprised."

    The Phonetic Alphabet Has Great Potential in the Language Class of Lower Grades in Primary School

    But can we think that the promoting effect of the phonetic alphabet on language teaching has been exhausted? I think there is another place where the role of the phonetic alphabet can be brought into play, but it has not yet been put into action. This is the language class in the lower grades of primary school. The crux of the language class in the lower grades of primary school lies in the contradiction between learning Chinese characters and learning Chinese. In addition to increasing children's knowledge, the language class has two tasks in terms of language: one is to develop children's language, including expanding vocabulary and organizing sentences; and the other is to let children learn the written form of the language, that is, to recognize Chinese characters and be able to read and write. Now the average age of children entering primary school is seven and a half years old. Children of seven and a half years old already have a fairly rich language, but they do not recognize Chinese characters and have to learn them one by one. It is difficult to compile textbooks that are rich in content, lively in language, and meet the requirements of developing children's language. Only learning characters first, and the study of language takes a secondary position. As a result, the language of the textbook lags behind the language of the children, and the knowledge content is also impoverished, making it bland and tasteless to read, and unable to encourage interest in learning. Even the textbooks in the middle grades still inevitably commit the same problem because the "capital" of Chinese characters is still insufficient. On the other hand, the task of learning characters is not completed very well. Take the trial textbook for junior primary schools in Beijing as an example (because this set of textbooks has a vocabulary list at the back, which is convenient for calculation. The vocabulary of the textbooks compiled by the People's Education Press is slightly different, but not much), the number of new words is:
    Volume 1 202 characters Volume 5 343 characters
    Volume 2 321 characters Volume 6 234 characters
    Volume 3 365 characters Volume 7 231 characters
    Volume 4 375 characters Volume 8 194 characters
    Total 1263 characters Total 1002 characters
    A primary school student, from the first grade to the fourth grade, has taken four years of language classes and only recognizes more than 2,200 characters. A junior primary school graduate, with an average age of eleven and a half years old, still does not recognize many commonly used characters, and there are still many characters that he can say and use but cannot write.

    Why is this the case? It is because from the beginning, it is required to carry out Chinese language teaching and Chinese character teaching in the same text, which restricts each other, and it is difficult to compile the text. The compilers have put a lot of effort into it, but they still can't take care of both ends, so that neither end is taken care of well. This is a difficult problem that has not been solved for many years. But this problem must be solved, and this difficult hurdle must be broken through. Because the effect of language teaching in the lower grades not only affects the language classes in the later grades, but also affects the learning of other subjects.

    I think, here is where the phonetic alphabet can be used. For example, in the first grade of primary school, the study of Chinese language and the study of Chinese characters can be temporarily carried out in two separate lines. On the one hand, teach the phonetic alphabet, and then teach phonetic texts, as much as possible to meet the needs of children to develop language and increase knowledge. On the other hand, "queue up" Chinese characters separately, some according to the rules of the shape of the characters (simple and complex shapes, similarities and differences in radicals, etc.), and some according to the connection of the meanings of the characters (same category of object names, opposite meanings of characters, verb-object matching, etc.), which can be learned more quickly. After a semester or a year, "reunite." By this time, children have mastered the weapon of the phonetic alphabet skillfully and can read simple and complete phonetic Chinese character reading materials, and they will definitely have a strong interest in reading. The textbooks can be compiled better, and extracurricular reading materials can be fully utilized. It is estimated that it is entirely possible to complete the task of learning characters that is now completed in four years—more than 2,200 characters, or even more—in two years, and the learning of other subjects will also be accelerated as a result. In this way, the six years of primary school may be shortened to four years.

    Letting the study of Chinese language and the study of Chinese characters in the first grade advance on separate paths will encounter two opposing opinions. One opposing opinion is that children are afraid of getting used to phonetic texts and will not be able to live without this "crutch" in the future. I don't advocate using crutches forever, but I think crutches should not be discarded too early. The disadvantage of Qi Jianhua's rapid literacy method is that it overemphasizes discarding crutches early. The textbooks after the convergence of Chinese language and Chinese characters should still be fully phonetic at first, and then gradually remove the phonetic spelling according to the students' familiarity, removing a batch after they are familiar with it, and finally reaching the point where only the newly appeared new words are phonetic. In fact, reading phonetic reading materials does not hinder the learning of Chinese characters. We have seen with our own eyes in Wanrong that both reading and spelling performances can take both sides into account.

    Another opinion is against the queue learning of Chinese characters. It is believed that learning individual characters is useless, and characters must be inseparable from words and words must be inseparable from sentences; at the same time, new words must appear repeatedly many times, so sentences must be connected into articles. Since the so-called "new school system textbooks" in the 1920s, this has always been the guiding principle for compiling primary school language textbooks, and no one has ever doubted it. I think this principle can also be further studied. Teaching non-Han people to learn Chinese may have to follow this principle. Teaching Han primary school students to learn Chinese characters is not entirely the same problem. For Han primary school students, Chinese characters can be divided into two categories: the first category is used to write words or morphemes that they are familiar with, and the second category is used to write words or morphemes that they do not know. Only the second category is the real new word, which needs to be repeatedly in different contexts. The first category of characters represents the language components that children have already mastered. Only the shape of the characters is new. It is only a "half-new word." As long as the shape of the character is connected with a certain sound and meaning, it is complete. It seems that there is no need for it to appear repeatedly in a changing way. Words like "cow," "sheep," "big," "small," "come," and "go," can't they be learned without repeating them back and forth in a complete text? I think that we must distinguish between language and writing. Learning the first category of characters is only learning writing (the shape of the characters), and learning the second category of characters is learning language and writing at the same time (shape, sound, and meaning). These two categories of characters do not have to be treated the same. There are some intersecting phenomena here, which will not be explained in detail now, but it is generally no problem to divide them into these two categories. The vocabulary of children aged seven or eight is already quite large, and most of the Chinese characters they need to learn belong to the first category, and they can be learned by taking a relatively simple method. Of course, queue learning of Chinese characters does not mean reading blocks of characters. It can also be matched with short phrases and sentences, but there is no need to take the form of connecting them into articles. If it is not possible to form an article, there is no way to jump out of the circle of the current textbook.

    In short, everyone admits that the teaching efficiency of language in primary schools, especially in the lower grades of primary schools, is not high, and the impact is very large. When poor, one thinks of change, and we must try every means to break through this barrier. The phonetic alphabet has already proven to be a powerful tool for improving the efficiency of language teaching in literacy work. It seems that it can also be allowed to play its role here.

    Fellow committee members, this is not a small problem. We know that the graduation level of our country's six-year primary school is only equivalent to the first four years of Soviet schools. To reach the graduation level of Soviet ten-year schools, we now need to use twelve years. In order to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and a modern science and culture as soon as possible, we must popularize general education as early as possible. If we can find a way to shorten the time of general education by two years, it will not only save the country a lot of manpower and material resources, but also allow young people with modern cultural knowledge and production skills to enter production or receive higher education two years earlier. This has an extremely great impact on the speed of our country's construction.

    The above are some of my personal thoughts caused by seeing the effect of phonetic literacy. Because I still lack in-depth research on this issue, there may be many incorrect opinions. Please give me your comments and corrections.

专栏：

    发挥汉语拼音方案的巨大力量
    吕叔湘委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我衷心拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，完全同意陈叔通副主席关于常务委员会工作的报告。不久以前，我参加了政协全国委员会文化教育组组织的山西河南参观团，在参观中我学习了许多东西，尤其是对于我国社会主义建设飞跃前进的情况获得了极其鲜明而深刻的印象。我们所到之处，在工业建设方面，工厂提前建成，提前投入生产，超额完成任务，并且都在继续扩建。无论是现代化的大厂或是原来以手工操作为主的小厂，都在大闹技术革命，获得显著成效。在农村方面，农业生产，林、牧、副、渔，文化活动，体育卫生，形成全面跃进，并且是遍地开花，显示出社会主义农村的新面貌。在教育方面，正在贯彻党的教育方针，教学和研究都与生产劳动相结合。到处可以看出，无论是物质财富的生产或是人们的精神面貌，都是欣欣向荣，一片新气象，实在令人兴奋。这是总路线的胜利，大跃进的胜利，人民公社的胜利，归总是毛泽东思想的胜利。由于我在这次参观中获得了这样鲜明深刻的感性认识，所以在听到两位副总理的报告的时候，感到非常具体而亲切。
    利用汉语拼音字母扫除文盲可以做到多快好省
    现在想就我在晋南农村中看到的利用汉语拼音字母扫除文盲的成效谈谈我的感想。扫盲工作从1949年以来就积极进行，也取得了一定的成绩，但是有一个关键问题始终没有能够很好地解决，这就是“回生”问题。很多扫盲毕了业的人，过些时候，认得的字又不认得了，一千五百字只剩下三五百甚至更少，“脱盲”之后又“复盲”。这是个非常严重的问题。自从1958年2月人大通过汉语拼音方案之后，好些地方就利用拼音字母做扫盲的工具，对于提高扫盲质量和巩固扫盲成果起了很大的作用，尤其是山西省万荣县在这方面取得了典型的经验。
    根据1958年10月的统计，万荣县三万多青壮年文盲中本来已经有将近三万四千人脱盲，但是大多数没有能巩固，有三分之一的人回生复盲，其余三分之二的人也识字不多，不能看书看报，不能提笔写文。拼音方案公布之后，万荣县决定进行注音扫盲工作。经过试点实验，取得经验之后，1959年11、12两月在全县范围推广。学员先用十五到三十小时学会汉语拼音，然后用一百小时或略多一点的时间阅读注音识字课本和练习写作。阅读学习分三个阶段。第一阶段是低速度，学习最常用的基础字，并掌握汉字结构，练习写字。第二阶段是中速度，第三阶段是高速度，除读完识字课本之外还要读十来本注音读物。在阅读学习的中间就开始练习写作，第一步是抄书，第二步是写话，第三步是作文。拼音、阅读、写作三个阶段，一共只用一百二十到一百五十小时，就能学会一千五百个汉字，达到扫盲毕业的标准。万荣县在两个月之内就把一万三千多文盲全部扫清，绝大多数进入业余高小。这次扫盲班毕业的学员，由于掌握了汉语拼音方案，会查字典，就不受识字数量的限制，可以自由阅读政治、文化、科技各方面的注音通俗读物，不怕“拦路虎”，无需找人问字。这样就根本解决了脱盲以后的巩固和提高问题，杜绝了回生复盲的现象。万荣县的成功经验现在已经在全国范围内推广，各地已经掀起“学万荣、赶万荣”的高潮。
    万荣县的经验说明什么问题呢？说明只有利用汉语拼音字母，扫盲工作才能做到多、快、好、省，体现总路线的精神。过去光用汉字扫盲，一般要用三百小时，还不容易巩固，现在只用不到一半的时间，不但可以巩固，而且便于提高。万荣经验中最值得注意的一点是强调高速度大量阅读，在学员还没有学完一千五百字的时候就让他们阅读大量注音读物，在阅读之中进行识字。在阅读教学的初期是“先识字，后读书”，到了后期就是“先读书，后识字”，“以熟带生，越带越熟；以多带少，越带越多”。学员由被动转为主动，可以自己逐步提高，不受限制。这是个宝贵的经验，但是如果不利用汉语拼音字母，就无法办到。
    教学拼音字母可以大大提高语文教学质量
    学习拼音字母，在业余高小也收到显著的成效。根据万荣县的经验，过去业余高小的三册语文需要二百四十课时，一般要学习两年，利用拼音字母改进教学方法之后只要四十到六十课时，可以在半年内学完。
    在普通小学里教学拼音字母也可以大大提高语文教学质量。（一）提高识字效率。学生掌握了拼音字母，汉字学得快，读得准，记得牢。万荣县城关小学一年级期终考试，平均识字率达到95％，过去仅能达到66％。（二）提高了阅读能力和阅读兴趣。学生不但阅读课文比以前熟练得多，而且大大开展了课外阅读。过去中年级还很少读课外书，现在低年级也大读特读起来。运城县小学生编了个顺口溜：“以前不会拼，就怕字不识，来回问老师，觉得太费事。现在不识字，一拼就认识，书中知识多，实在有意思。”（三）提高了写作水平。过去学生由于受识字量的限制，心里要说的话笔底下写不出，不是写白字、留空白，就是避开这句话不用，作文很短，内容也很贫乏。现在识字多了，又会查字典，查不出的字还可以用拼音替代，因此想说什么就能写什么，做到了畅所欲言。万荣县南张小学四年级学生上学期开学的时候还没有学过拼音字母，一般作文只能写二百字，平均有错别字六个；现在一般能写六百多字，错别字平均不到两个。（四）促进了别的学科的学习。过去由于学生语文程度差，别的学科得用一部分时间讲解字句，现在可以用全部时间讲课程内容，同时学生语文程度提高了，理解力也跟着提高了，学习起来也更加容易了。
    从上面所说各种事实看来，拼音字母的作用真是伟大。用拼音字母帮助识字，其意义不仅仅是正汉字的读音，也不仅仅是可以防止遗忘，更重要的是把识字的钥匙交给了不识字的人，让他“无师自通”，奋勇前进。拼音字母的这一作用已经为万荣以及很多别的地方的经验所证明，不但过去对这一点没有认识的人感到十分惊异，连原来认识到这一点的人也有点“喜出望外”。
    拼音字母对小学低年级的语文课大有用武之地
    但是可以不可以认为拼音字母在语文教学上的促进作用已经尽在于斯了呢？我觉得还有一个地方可以发挥拼音字母的作用而现在还没有动起来。这就是小学低年级的语文课。小学低年级语文课的癥结在于识汉字和学汉语的矛盾。语文课除了增长儿童的知识外，在语文方面有两个任务：一是发展儿童的语言，包括扩大词汇和组织语句；二是让儿童学会语言的书写形式，也就是认识汉字，能读能写。现在儿童进小学的平均年龄是七岁半，七岁半儿童的语言已经相当丰富了，但是他不认得汉字，得一个一个学起来。课文要“白手起家”，就很难编得内容丰富，语言生动，符合发展儿童语言的要求。只能以识字为先，语言的学习退居次要的地位。结果是课本的语言落后于儿童的语言，知识内容也随之贫乏，读起来淡而无味，不能鼓动学习的兴趣。甚至中年级的课本，由于汉字的“本钱”仍然不足，还是免不了犯同样的毛病。另一方面，识字的任务也完成得并不怎样出色。拿北京市初级小学试用课本做例
  （因为这套课本后面有生字表，便于计算，人民教育出版社所编课本的生字略有出入，但是相差不多），生字的数目是：
  第一册　202字　第五册　343字
  第二册　321字　第六册　234字
  第三册　365字　第七册　231字
  第四册　375字　第八册　194字
  共计　1263字　共计　1002字
    一个小学生，从一年级到四年级，上了四年语文课，一共才认识了二千二百多字。一个初小毕业生，平均年龄十一岁半，还有许多常用字不认得，还有许多会说会用的字写不出来。
    为什么会有这样的情况？就是因为一起头就要求在同一课文里进行汉语教学和汉字教学，互相牵制，课文很难编。编的人煞费苦心，还是顾了这头顾不了那头，以致两头都顾不好。这是多年来没有解决的困难问题，是一个难关。但是这个问题必须解决，这个难关必须突破。因为低年级语文教学的效果不仅影响到以后各年级的语文课，还影响到别的学科的学习。
    我觉得，这里有拼音字母用武之地。比如说，在小学一年级把汉语的学习和汉字的学习暂时分两条线进行。一面教拼音字母，接着就教拼音课文，尽量满足儿童发展语言和增长知识的需要，一面把汉字另行“排队”，有的按照字形的规律（字形繁简、偏旁异同等等），有的按照字义的联系（物名同类、字义相反、动宾搭配等等），学习起来可以较快。到一学期或一年之后再“会师”，到这时候，儿童已经熟练地掌握拼音字母这一武器，可以阅读浅近的全部注音的汉字读物，并且也一定会有浓厚的阅读兴趣。课本可以编得更好，还可以充分利用课外读物。估计在两年里完成现在用四年完成的识字任务——二千二百多字，甚至更多一些，是完全可能的，别的学科的学习也会因而加快。这样，小学六年就可能缩短成四年。
    让一年级的汉语学习和汉字学习分路进军，会遇到两种反对意见。一种反对意见是怕儿童看惯了拼音课文，以后就离不了这个“拐棍”。我并不主张永远带拐棍，但是我觉得拐棍不能丢得太早。祁建华速成识字法的缺点就是过于强调早丢拐棍。汉语和汉字汇合之后的课本，最初还是应该全部注音，然后按照学生熟悉的程度，逐步抽掉注音，熟悉一批抽一批，最后达到只有新出现的生字注音。事实上，阅读注音读物并不会妨碍汉字的学习，我们在万荣亲眼看到的阅读和拼写表演都是能够两面兼顾的。
    另一种意见是反对汉字排队学习。认为单个的字学了没有用，必须字不离词，词不离句；同时，生字必须反复多次出现，因此，句又必须连贯成篇。从二十年代所谓“新学制教科书”起，这一直是编写小学语文课本的指导原则，从来没有人怀疑过。我觉得这个原则也还可以进一步加以研究。教非汉族的人学汉语，恐怕必须遵守这个原则。教汉族小学生学汉字，问题不完全相同。对汉族小学生来说，汉字可以分成两类：第一类是用来写他所熟悉的词或词素的，第二类是用来写他所不认识的词或词素的。只有第二类才是真正的生字，才需要放在不同的上下文里多次反复。第一类字代表儿童已经掌握的语言成份，只有字形是生的，只是个“半生字”，只要把这个字形跟一定的音义联系起来就成，似乎没有变化着反复出现的必要。像“牛”、“羊”、“大”、“小”、“来”、“去”这些字，难道不放在成篇的课文里颠来倒去地反复就不能学会吗？我觉得，必须区别语言和文字，学第一类字只是学习文字（字形），学第二类字才是语言文字同时学（形、音、义），这两类字是不必同样对待的。这里边有一些交叉现象，现在不去细说，但是大体上可以分这两类是没有问题的。七八岁的儿童的词汇已经相当大，他需要学习的汉字大多数属于第一类，是可以采取比较简便的方法来学习的。当然，汉字排队学习不等于念字块儿，也可以搭配成短语短句，但是没有必要采取连缀成篇的形式。如果非成篇不可，就没有法子跳出现在课本的圈子。
    总之，现在小学，特别是小学低年级，语文教学效率不高，影响很大，这是大家都承认的。穷则思变，必须千方百计突破这一关。拼音字母在扫盲工作中已经证明是提高语文教学效率的有力工具，似乎可以让它在这里也发挥出它所能发挥的作用。
    各位委员，这不是一个小问题。我们知道，我国小学六年毕业的水平只抵得上苏联学校的前四年。达到苏联十年制学校毕业的水平，我们现在要用十二年。为了尽快地把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大社会主义国家，我们必须尽可能提早普及普通教育。如果能设法把普通教育的时间缩短两年，不但能为国家节省大量人力、物力，还可以让具有现代文化知识和生产技能的青年提早两年投入生产或受高等教育。这对于我国建设速度的影响是极其巨大的。
    以上是我个人因看到注音扫盲的效果而引起的一些想法。因为对这个问题还缺乏深入的研究，意见可能很多不正确的地方，敬请各位委员指教。
