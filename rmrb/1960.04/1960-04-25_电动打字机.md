    Electric Typewriter
    The Nanming District Typewriter Factory in Guiyang City recently successfully trial-produced an electric typewriter.
    The electric typewriter trial-produced by this factory can automatically wrap lines, automatically backspace, and automatically type. It is easy and flexible to operate, and its work efficiency is increased by about 25% compared with ordinary typewriters.
    This electric typewriter is easy to master and can also avoid the phenomenon of garbled characters and skipped characters caused by uneven force when typing with ordinary typewriters, which can further ensure the quality of typing.

    这种电动打字机很容易掌握，还可以避免一般打字机打字时，因用力不匀所发生的串字、跳字等现象，能进一步保证打字质量。
