Chen Yu's congratulatory speech at the New Zealand Communist Party Congress

The New Zealand Communist Party faithfully defends the interests of the New Zealand people, holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, wages a resolute struggle against revisionism, and has contributed to the defense of world peace. The friendship between the Chinese and New Zealand parties and the peoples of the two countries is developing and strengthening day by day. As long as we continue to be vigilant against the imperialist forces of war, closely unite the people, and wage unremitting struggles, the just struggle of the people of all countries to defend peace and strive for social progress will continue to achieve new victories.

Xinhua News Agency, Auckland, 16th: The National Congress of the New Zealand Communist Party was held in Auckland from April 15th to 17th. Chen Yu, representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a congratulatory speech at the congress. The full text of the congratulatory message is as follows: Dear Comrades:

Entrusted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I have come to attend the National Congress of the New Zealand Communist Party and, on behalf of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, extend warm and fraternal congratulations to your party's congress and wish the congress a complete success!

The New Zealand Communist Party has experienced a long and glorious road of struggle. Since its establishment, it has been the most faithful and steadfast representative and defender of the interests of the New Zealand working class and all working people. In recent years, the New Zealand Communist Party has resolutely opposed the imperialist war policy and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which harms the national interests of New Zealand, in order to defend world peace and safeguard national independence and sovereignty. In order to continuously raise the consciousness of the New Zealand working class, strengthen the connection between the New Zealand Communist Party and the masses, and promote the unity of the New Zealand working class with all progressive forces to oppose the oppression of monopoly capital, the New Zealand Communist Party has conducted extensive activities among the masses and has waged a constant struggle against the bourgeois reformism that corrodes the working class. Three years ago, under the leadership of the National Committee, your party smashed the vicious attack of revisionists on the party, defended the principles of Marxism-Leninism, thereby strengthening the unity of the party's ranks and enhancing the unity of your party with the international communist movement. The achievements your party has made in recent years are closely related to your victorious struggle against revisionism.

The New Zealand Communist Party and the New Zealand people have always been concerned about and supported the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and socialist construction cause. The friendship between our two parties and the peoples of our two countries is developing and strengthening day by day. Last autumn, Comrade V. G. Wilcox, General Secretary of your party, personally led a delegation from the New Zealand Communist Party to Beijing to participate in our country's 10th anniversary celebrations, which greatly encouraged our people. Today, I am very pleased to be able to come to your country as a representative of the Communist Party of China and directly express our sincere friendship to the comrades and, through you, to the New Zealand people. We firmly believe that the friendship between our two parties and the peoples of our two countries will be further developed.

Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, holding high the victorious banner of the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, are continuing to carry out socialist construction at a high speed. As a result of the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years, the main targets of my country's Second Five-Year Plan have been completed three years ahead of schedule. In 1960, the main production targets planned for my country: steel will reach 18.4 million tons, coal 425 million tons, and grain and cotton will continue to increase by about 10% on the basis of 1959. The Chinese people will complete and strive to overfulfill this year's production plan with full confidence and will build China, which was originally "poor and blank," into a socialist, prosperous, and strong country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in a not-too-long period.

The great Soviet people are striving to complete and overfulfill the magnificent seven-year plan for the comprehensive construction of communism ahead of schedule and have achieved brilliant achievements in all aspects. The national economies of other socialist countries are also developing rapidly. The rapid advancement of the construction of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the growing unbreakable unity between them fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system, which cannot but greatly inspire the people of all countries around the world who are striving for peace, independence, democracy, and socialism.

Comrades, the current international situation has eased somewhat, which is precisely the result of the vigorous development of the socialist camp, the unprecedented upsurge of the national liberation movement, and the resolute struggle of the peace-loving people of the world. Imperialism has been frustrated, but they are not reconciled. In particular, American imperialism, while playing peace tricks, is stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations. It is sparing no effort to cultivate and support the new Nazi forces in West Germany and the militarists in Japan, making these two countries new sources of war; it also occupies China's territory of Taiwan. The so-called "great debate" recently conducted in the United States is not about peace or war, but about how to prepare for war. But the conspiracies and tricks of American imperialism will never succeed. Because today, the general trend of the world is decisively in favor of the forces of peace, democracy, and progress. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. That is to say, the united forces of socialism, national liberation, and peace-loving people have surpassed the forces of imperialism. As long as we continue to be vigilant against the imperialist forces of war, closely unite the people, and wage unremitting struggles, the just struggle of the people of all countries to defend peace and strive for social progress will continue to achieve new victories. Similarly, the struggle of the New Zealand working class and working people for peace, democracy, and socialism will surely achieve final victory.

Comrades, now please allow me to read the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to your party's congress.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Congratulatory Message to the National Congress of the Communist Party of New Zealand

Dear Comrades:

The Communist Party of New Zealand is the vanguard of the New Zealand working class. It has consistently waged a tenacious struggle to safeguard the vital interests and democratic rights of the New Zealand working people and to realize socialism, and has made contributions to the just cause of safeguarding world peace and opposing the imperialist war and aggression policies; The Communist Party of New Zealand has also held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and waged a resolute struggle against the anti-Party revisionist elements and Yugoslav revisionism, thereby safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism and strengthening the unity of the Party; The Chinese Communists are glad and encouraged by the achievements your Party has made.

Wish your congress complete success! Wish the Communist Party of New Zealand new achievements in uniting the working class and all the working people as well as all progressive democratic forces in the struggle for peace, democracy and socialism!

                              The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    陈郁在新西兰共产党代表大会上致贺词
    新西兰共产党忠实捍卫着新西兰人民的利益，高举马克思列宁主义旗帜，同修正主义进行坚决斗争，并对保卫世界和平作出了贡献。中国和新西兰两党和两国人民之间的友谊正在日益发展和增强。只要我们继续保持对于帝国主义战争势力的警惕，紧紧地团结人民，进行坚持不懈的斗争，各国人民保卫和平和争取社会进步的正义斗争必将继续不断地取得新的胜利。
    新华社16日讯　奥克兰消息：新西兰共产党全国代表大会从4月15日到17日在奥克兰举行，中国共产党中央委员会代表陈郁在大会上致词祝贺。贺词全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    我受中国共产党中央委员会的委托，前来参加新西兰共产党全国代表大会并代表中国共产党和中国人民向你们党的代表大会表示热烈的兄弟般的祝贺，并祝大会获得圆满的成功！
    新西兰共产党经历了长期的和光荣的斗争道路。它自成立以来，一直是新西兰工人阶级和全体劳动人民的利益的最忠实和坚定的代表者和捍卫者。最近几年以来，新西兰共产党为着保卫世界和平，捍卫本民族的独立和主权，坚决地反对帝国主义的战争政策，反对损害新西兰民族利益的东南亚条约组织。为着不断地提高新西兰工人阶级的觉悟，加强新西兰共产党同人民群众的联系，和推进新西兰工人阶级同一切进步力量的团结，以反对垄断资本的压迫，新西兰共产党在人民群众中进行了广泛的活动，并且同腐蚀工人阶级的资产阶级的改良主义进行了不断的斗争。三年以前，你们党在全国委员会的领导之下，粉碎了修正主义分子对党的恶毒进攻，保卫了马克思列宁主义的原则，从而增强了党的队伍的团结，增进了你们党同国际共产主义运动的团结。最近几年你们党所取得的成就，是同你们胜利地粉碎修正主义的斗争，密切地关联在一起的。
    新西兰共产党和新西兰人民一向关心和支持中国人民的革命斗争和社会主义的建设事业。我们两党和两国人民之间的友谊正在日益发展和增强。去年秋天你们党的总书记韦尔科克斯同志亲自率领了新西兰共产党代表团到了北京，参加我国建国十周年庆典，给我国人民以很大的鼓舞。今天，我非常高兴能够以中国共产党代表的身份来到你们的国家，直接向同志们、并通过你们向新西兰人民表达我们真挚的友情。我们深信，我们两党和两国人民之间的友谊将会得到进一步的发展。
    中国共产党和中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央领导之下，高举着社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的胜利旗帜，正在继续高速度地进行社会主义建设。由于过去两年持续大跃进的结果，我国第二个五年计划的主要指标已经提前三年完成。1960年我国计划的主要生产指标：钢将要达到一千八百四十万吨，煤四万二千五百万吨，粮、棉要在1959年的基础上，继续提高10％左右。中国人民将满怀信心地完成和争取超额完成今年的生产计划，要在不太长的期间内，把原来“一穷二白”的中国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义的富强国家。
    伟大的苏联人民正在为提前超额完成规模宏伟的全面建设共产主义的七年计划而奋斗，并且在各方面都取得了辉煌的成就。其他社会主义国家的国民经济也都在飞快地发展着。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国建设的突飞猛进以及它们之间日益增长的牢不可破的团结，充分地表明了社会主义制度的优越性，这不能不极大地鼓舞全世界争取和平、独立、民主和社会主义的各国人民。
    同志们，目前国际形势有了某些缓和，这正是由于社会主义阵营的蓬勃发展、民族解放运动的空前高涨以及全世界爱好和平的人民坚决斗争的结果。帝国主义受到了挫折，但他们并不甘心。特别是美帝国主义，它一面玩弄和平手法，一面加紧扩军备战。它正不遗余力地培植和支持西德的新纳粹势力和日本的军国主义者；使这两个国家成为新的战争策源地；它还霸占中国的领土台湾。最近美国国内进行的所谓“大辩论”，并不是关于和平或者战争的问题，而是讨论如何准备战争的问题。但是美帝国主义的阴谋诡计决不能得逞。因为今天世界的大势是决定地有利于和平民主和进步的力量，正如毛泽东同志所说，是东风压倒了西风。这就是说，社会主义的、民族解放的和爱好和平的联合力量，已经超过了帝国主义的力量。只要我们继续保持对于帝国主义战争势力的警惕，紧紧地团结人民，进行坚持不懈的斗争，各国人民保卫和平和争取社会进步的正义斗争必将继续不断地取得新的胜利。同样地，新西兰工人阶级和劳动人民为争取和平、民主和社会主义而进行的斗争，也一定会取得最后的胜利。
    同志们，现在请允许我宣读中国共产党中央委员会致你们党代表大会的贺词。
      中国共产党中央委员会致新西兰共产党全国代表大会贺词新西兰共产党全国代表大会亲爱的代表同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会谨代表中国共产党全体党员和中国全体人民，向新西兰共产党全国代表大会表示热烈的兄弟般的祝贺，向新西兰工人阶级和全体劳动人民致以亲切的问候。
    新西兰共产党是新西兰工人阶级的先锋队。它一贯地为维护新西兰劳动人民的切身利益和民主权利，为实现社会主义进行了坚韧斗争，并且对维护世界和平和反对帝国主义战争政策和侵略政策的正义事业，作出了贡献；新西兰共产党还高举着马克思列宁主义的旗帜，同反党的修正主义分子和南斯拉夫修正主义进行了坚决的斗争，从而保卫了马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，增强了党的队伍的团结；中国共产党人为你们党所取得的成就感到高兴和鼓舞。
    祝你们的代表大会圆满成功！祝新西兰共产党在团结工人阶级和全体劳动人民以及一切进步民主力量为争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中获得新的成就！
                              中国共产党中央委员会
