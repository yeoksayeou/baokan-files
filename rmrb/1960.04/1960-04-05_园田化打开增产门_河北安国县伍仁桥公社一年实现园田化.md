People's Commune Investigation

	Field Management Opens the Door to Increased Production
	Wu Renqiao Commune, Anguo County, Hebei Province Achieves Field Management in One Year
	Lü Keren, Meng Qingchen
	More than 60,000 members of the Wu Renqiao People's Commune in Anguo County, Hebei Province, with dauntless spirit and hard work, and relying on the superiority of the People's Commune, have achieved large-scale, square, and well-managed fields on a large area of land, with level ground like mirrors, straight ridges like lines, and roads forming a network. Practice over the past year has proven that large-scale, square field management is a powerful measure for developing agricultural production at high speed, a major revolution from small-area, high-yield production to large-area, high-yield production, paving the way for agricultural mechanization and electrification. As the commune members said, "Communalization has planted the roots of happiness, and field management has opened the door to increased production."

		New Issues in Production Development
	This commune includes forty villages, with 128,000 mu of cultivated land and 61,000 people. The Sha River, Zi River, and Xiao Tang River flow through the area. In winter and spring, the water is often shallow and the rivers dry up, making it impossible to irrigate the fields. In summer and autumn, the river water often rises sharply, causing floods. Before liberation, the average yield of grain per mu was only about 130 jin. Under the exploitation of the landlords, the peasants were unable to resist the years of natural disasters and had to live a poor and miserable life.
	After liberation, from mutual aid teams to elementary cooperatives, the productive forces were continuously liberated, and the production conditions and economic conditions became better and better. Thanks to the active construction of water conservancy projects and the increased application of fertilizers by the broad masses of peasants, production has greatly developed. The average yield per mu increased from 297 jin in 1953 to 347 jin in 1955.
	After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, miracles of high yields of thousands of jin of grain per mu appeared on many lands that had been transformed into fields. This liberated the minds of the broad masses of commune members in practice, and their demands for accelerating production development became even higher. People said: "Since field management can greatly increase production, why don't we turn all the land into fields?"

		A Revolution in Agricultural Cultivation
	In August 1958, the Wu Renqiao People's Commune was established. The commune's Party committee put forward the call to "vigorously develop large-scale square field management and completely change the natural landscape," which was immediately supported by all commune members.
	In order to gain experience, the commune's Party committee decided to first create a wheat high-yield plot as a model in order to promote the general through focusing on the key. This experimental field was located east of Wu Renqiao village, covering 650 mu. This piece of land had 19 large pits and countless small depressions and pits. There were also 18 ditch paths and a dozen abandoned wells. Liu Fuzeng, the secretary of the commune's Party committee, personally took charge, and together with Deputy Secretary Wang Kuiyong and agricultural technicians, designed a field management blueprint, stipulating the specifications and quality of deep plowing and land leveling. After more than 3,000 people worked diligently for more than 20 days, this land, which had been full of holes and scars, was transformed into a large, square field with level ground like a mirror and straight ridges like lines, according to the blueprint. This was a new initiative, and the commune members named this new field "The Number One Field in the World."
	Within a year, this commune moved from small-area field management to large-square field management, and from a few large-square fields to all large-square fields. This new situation of great production change brought a series of new problems in operation and management. In the early stage of establishing a few large-square fields, professional teams of young and strong individuals with certain agricultural skills were mostly drawn to manage them. However, when it came to large-square field management, this approach was no longer entirely suitable. First, there were not so many forces that could be drawn; second, after doing so, the disparity in strength was too great, and it was impossible to ensure that all large-square fields achieved high yields. In addition, some production teams had also implemented a management method where one production team operated one square. Practice has proven that this method is also problematic at present. On the one hand, the soil quality of the square fields is good and bad, and the production development of the production teams is uneven; on the other hand, the production teams need to manage a variety of crops, and if they do so in one square field, they cannot achieve adapting to local conditions and cannot give full play to the potential of the land. At the same time, if only one crop is planted, there will be problems of labor being tight at times and loose at other times, affecting production.
	Experience was gained through practice. The commune analyzed the situation of realizing large-square field management of all land. Except for retaining professional teams on a few square fields in order to create high-yield experience, within the scope of the production team, a management method of one square field for multiple teams (squads) and one team (squad) for multiple square fields was widely adopted. The production team appropriately matched square fields of different soil qualities according to the population and labor force of each production squad. In order to ensure unified management of the square fields and promote advanced technologies, a technical research station with the participation of cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers was organized in each square field, and a small "experimental field" was planted. Uniform operating procedures were formulated through experiments, and production technologies were promoted and researched. Experience has proven that under the current organizational system, the advantage of the management method of one production team managing multiple squares is that it can give full play to the potential of the land, balance the income of the teams, and facilitate the development of production competition between the teams.
	The commune's Party committee summarized the experience of creating the "Number One Field in the World," also absorbed the experience of old farmers growing vegetable gardens in the past, as well as the experience of small-area high-yield production and the results of scientific research, and proposed eight standards for large-square field management: 1. Deep plowing from one foot to three feet; 2. Level ground like a mirror, straight ridges like lines; 3. Building a unified irrigation system to realize irrigation mechanization; 4. Applying 10,000 to 30,000 jin of fertilizer per mu in the fields; 5. Implementing rational close planting; 6. Regionalized planting; 7. Implementing scientific management; 8. Road network in the fields. The commune's Party committee also called on all Party members and commune members to have lofty ambitions, set great goals, and with the great revolutionary spirit, wage war against nature and resolutely realize large-square field management of all the commune's 120,000 mu of land like the "Number One Field in the World." A mass movement centered on vigorously developing field management was launched with overwhelming momentum. Following the "Number One Field in the World," a "10,000-Mu Cotton Field Square" was created south of Nanloudi Village. This square was a much larger project than the "Number One Field in the World." The commune organized more than 7,000 male and female commune members, who spent half a month leveling the kiln bumps, filling in the large ditches, and deep-plowing and leveling 10,000 mu of land, turning it into a large area of ​​level fields. In this way, the cadres and commune members of the whole commune worked diligently for a winter and a spring, connecting more than 110,000 mu of cultivated land into large areas, leveling them, establishing a unified irrigation system, and establishing a road network connecting this village to that village and this field to that field.

		One Key Opens Two Locks
	Why is the speed of building large-square field management so fast? People say that the People's Commune is like a universal key, opening the two locks that the advanced cooperative could not open in the construction of large-area field management.
	The Wu Renqiao Commune has many rivers within its boundaries, and thousands of years of siltation and scouring have caused uneven land. To realize large-area field management, leveling the land has become a particularly important task. However, this task was difficult for the advanced cooperative to accomplish due to insufficient labor. As soon as the original Nanloudi advanced cooperative was established, it wanted to engage in a large-area field of 3,000 mu. Each mu of land required 20 workdays, and it would take 60,000 workdays to complete the leveling. However, the entire cooperative only had more than 300 laborers, and each laborer needed to do 200 workdays. This calculation frightened some production teams. The Li Guilin production team had great determination and sufficient enthusiasm, but when they had done 40 or 50 mu, other farm work had already been greatly affected, so they had to stop. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the first lock of insufficient labor was opened. The commune uniformly organized labor for large-scale cooperation, solving the problem of labor shortage. On the one hand, the commune leadership seized the winter and spring seasons to organize labor to comprehensively advance towards field management, and also carried out large-scale cooperation according to the uneven opportunities for busy and idle periods of various production teams due to different crop planting. At the end of autumn, 80% of the land in the production teams north of the Zi River was planted with wheat, while the wheat planting task in the production teams south of the Zi River only accounted for 20% of the land area. In order to focus on doing a good job in the 10,000-mu wheat field square north of the Zi River, nearly 10,000 laborers from more than a dozen production teams south of the Zi River were organized to support it. In early spring, the opposite situation occurred. The spring sowing task was large south of the Zi River, and the spring sowing task was small north of the Zi River. Therefore, more than 20 production teams north of the Zi River, with more than 7,000 laborers, were organized to support it. The 4,000 mu of high and uneven land quickly became a neat and flat cotton field square.
	The contradiction between the interspersed fields between cooperatives and the establishment of large-area field management was also a headache for the advanced cooperative. The original advanced cooperative was basically one village per cooperative, and the land between the cooperatives was staggered. Beiloudi wanted to engage in field management south of the village, but there was a piece of land from Wu Renqiao in the middle; and Wu Renqiao wanted to build a field square south of the village, but pieces of land from Beiloudi were inserted into the square field in seven long and eight short pieces. Because the land was operated separately by the two cooperatives, although several discussions on exchanging land were held, they were always entangled and unclear. Neither of these two fields was completed in a year. At the same time, when each cooperative originally engaged in field management, they all acted according to their own convenience when building roads because they could not have unified planning. As a result, many roads did not match the intersections between villages, causing inconvenience for people to travel between this village and that village, and many abandoned roads had to be used again. After communalization, these contradictions were easily resolved. Under the overall arrangement and unified planning of the commune, based on the principles of general rationality between production teams and favorable to production development, the land was appropriately exchanged and the roads were uniformly planned according to the plan of large-square field management. In this way, not only were the square fields neat and the roads smooth, but also planting was convenient.

		Large-Square Field Management Has Unparalleled Superiority
	After the Wu Renqiao People's Commune implemented large-square field management, it was unanimously praised by the broad masses of commune members:
	1. It is convenient for mechanical operation and creates good conditions for agricultural mechanization and electrification. Large-square field management has the characteristics of large plots, flat ground, and standardized planting. Tractors, seeders, and harvesters can turn less and transfer less plots during operation, so they can greatly exert their efficiency. According to the comparison of using the same tractor, the same fuel consumption, and the same cultivation time before and after communalization, a tractor cultivated 35 mu of land per shift before communalization; after communalization, it cultivated 50 mu of land per shift, increasing efficiency by 40%. Tractor drivers said: "It's really enjoyable to work in a large-square field. This is really the time for the 'iron ox' to show its power!"
	2. It is convenient to realize water conservancy and irrigation mechanization. In establishing water conservancy facilities suitable for large-square field management, the commune rationally arranged the location and quantity of machine wells according to the plan of large-square fields. The whole commune quickly completed 340 machine wells. At the same time, the commune mobilized the masses to invest and contribute materials, and extracted a portion of funds from the public accumulation, so that the number of drainage and irrigation machinery in the commune increased from 203 to 250. After the commune uniformly controlled the amount of channel water used and rationally arranged the time of water use, the contradictions of channel water use were also eliminated.
	3. It is convenient to adapt to local conditions and can greatly exert the potential of the land. Large-square field management has the superiority of unified planning and planting, and can allocate and determine the crops to be planted according to the soil conditions of the large-square fields. For example, the Fengbo production team originally had black soil south of the village, which was suitable for growing corn but not for growing sweet potatoes; while the north of the village was sandy soil, which was suitable for growing sweet potatoes but not for growing corn. However, because the land of each advanced cooperative could not be unified in planning, the phenomenon of unreasonable planting existed for a long time; after large-square field management, after gradually conducting a general survey of the soil, the cadres and commune members knew the nature of each square of land, plus the regionalization of planting, according to the planting plan of each production team, they allocated the operation of large-square fields. In this way, the original unreasonable land use situation was changed. The black land, which originally only produced 2,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu, yielded more than 800 jin of corn per mu in 1959; the sandy land, which originally only yielded more than 100 jin of corn per mu, yielded more than 5,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu in 1959. This item alone increased production by more than 100,000 jin of grain.
	4. It is convenient to promote new technologies. Agricultural technicians said: In order to adapt to the needs of planting regionalization brought about by large-square field management, technical research stations with the participation of cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers were organized in each large-square field, and were responsible for planting a certain number of experimental fields. In this way, it is convenient to experiment on the spot, compare on the spot, promote on the spot, guide on the spot, and exchange experience on the spot. In the past year, rational close planting, improved varieties, and prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests have been fully realized on more than 110,000 mu of land in the entire commune.
	5. It is convenient to scientifically organize and allocate labor and improve labor productivity. Because the management method of one square field for multiple teams and one team for multiple squares is adopted, this creates very good conditions for organizing competitions and organizing inspections and evaluations. At the same time, because the large-square fields are neat, it is also convenient to plan labor quotas. With the realization of large-square field management, a road network connecting this square field to that square field and this village to that village has also been built, which has also played a great role in improving transportation efficiency and saving manpower and animal power.
	6. After the realization of large-square field management, the output of some poor teams that originally had low yields due to poor soil quality has increased rapidly. The original low-lying alkaline land of the Zhuotou production team could only grow one season of crops, and the yield was very low. After the construction of large-square field management, mechanized farming and mechanical irrigation were realized, and the unit area yield jumped to the most advanced level in the entire commune.
	Large-square field management has great superiority. In the first year of communalization, it overcame serious drought and flood disasters and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The whole commune planted more than 77,000 mu of grain crops (of which more than 18,000 mu were affected by floods), with an average yield of 1,092 jin per mu; 27,000 mu of cotton, with an average yield of more than 60 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In 1959, the grain unit area yield increased by 57% compared with 1958, and the cotton increased by 55.5%.
	The bumper harvest of agricultural production has improved people's lives and provided more agricultural products. For grain alone, 20 million jin were sold to the state, an increase of 40% compared with 1958. There were also 2.9 million jin of cotton, 10 million jin of vegetables, and 5 million jin of scallions. With the increase of the income of the commune and commune members, public accumulation has also expanded. The whole commune has now built a tractor station with 26 tractors, 16 combine harvesters, 9 threshers, and 450 large and small machines.

    园田化打开增产门
    河北安国县伍仁桥公社一年实现园田化
    吕克仁　孟庆琛
    河北安国县伍仁桥人民公社六万多名社员，以大无畏的气概和辛勤的劳动，依靠人民公社的优越性，在大片的土地上实现了地平如镜、垅直似线、公路成网的大方园田化。一年来的实践证明，大方园田化是高速度发展农业生产的有力措施，是由小面积高额丰产到大面积高额丰产的大革命，它给农业机械化、电气化铺平了道路。正如社员们所说：“公社化扎下幸福根，园田化打开增产门。”
            生产发展的新课题
    这个公社包括四十个村，有耕地十二万八千亩，六万一千人。境内有沙河、滋河、小唐河，冬春往往水浅河干，不能灌溉田地；夏秋又常常河水猛涨，泛滥成灾。解放前，常年亩产粮食不过一百三十斤左右。农民在地主的压榨下，无力抵抗连年的天灾，不得不过着贫困悲惨的生活。
    解放以后，由互助组到初级社，生产力不断得到解放，生产条件、经济条件越来越好，由于广大农民积极兴修水利，增施肥料，生产有了很大的发展。1955年平均亩产量由1953年的二百九十七斤提高到三百四十七斤。
    经过1958年大跃进，在很多变为园田的土地上，出现了亩产千斤粮的高额丰产的奇迹，使广大社员在实践中解放了思想，对加速发展生产的要求更高了，人们说：“既然园田化能大量增产，我们为什么不把所有的土地都变成园田呢？”
            农业耕作的革命
  1958年8月，伍仁桥人民公社产生了。公社党委提出了“大搞大方园田化，彻底改变自然面貌”的号召，立即得到全体社员的支持。
    公社党委为了取得经验，决定先搞一块小麦丰产方作样板，以便通过重点推动一般。这块试验田在伍仁桥村东，有六百五十亩。这片土地上，有十九个大坑，小洼小坑不计其数。还有十八条道沟，十几个废井。公社党委书记刘福增亲自挂帅，并由副书记王奎永和农业技术人员一起，设计出园田化的图样，规定了深翻、平整土地的规格和质量。经过组织三千多人二十多天的辛勤劳动，这块曾经是百孔千疮的土地，按照图样变为地平如镜、埂直似线的大方园田了。这是一种新的创举，社员们将这块新园田命名为“天下第一田”。
    一年的时间里，这个公社由小面积园田到大方园田，由少数大方园田到全部大方园田。这个生产大变化的新形势，给经营管理上带来了一系列的新问题。在建立少数大方园田的初期，多是抽调年青体壮和有一定农业技术的专业队进行管理，但到大方园田化时，这种做法已不完全适应了。一是没有这么多可抽调的力量；二是这样作以后，力量悬殊太大，不能保证全部大方园田达到高产的目的。另外，有的生产队还实行过一个生产小队经营一方的管理方法。实践证明，这种方法在目前说来也有问题。因为一方面，方田的土质有好有坏，生产小队的生产发展不平衡；另一方面，生产小队需要经营多种作物，如果在一块方田内这样作，不能达到因地制宜，不能发挥土地的潜力，同时，如果只种一种作物，又会发生劳力时松时紧的问题，影响生产。
    经过实践取得了经验。公社分析了全部土地实现大方园田化的形势，除在少数方田上保留专业队，以便创造丰产经验以外，在生产队的范围内，广泛采取了一方多队（小队）、一队（小队）多方的管理方法。生产队根据每个生产小队的人口、劳动力，适应搭配不同土质的方田。为了保证统一管理方田和推广先进技术，每个方田内都组织了有干部、技术员、老农参加的技术研究站，并种植一小块“试验田”，通过试验制定统一的操作规程和推广、研究生产技术。经验证明，在目前组织体制下，一个生产小队多方管理方法的好处是：能发挥土地的潜力，能使队与队的收入平衡，便于开展队与队的生产竞赛。
    公社党委总结了创建“天下第一田”的经验，也吸取了过去老农种菜园的经验，以及小面积高额丰产的经验和科学研究的成果，提出了大方园田化的八项标准：一、深翻地一尺到三尺；二、地平如镜，埂直似线；三、建设统一的灌溉系统，实现灌溉机械化；四、园田里每亩地施肥一万到三万斤；五、实行合理密植；六、种植区域化；七、实行科学管理；八、田间公路成网。公社党委还号召全体党员和社员，树雄心，立大志，以伟大的革命气魄，向大自然开战，坚决把全社十二万多亩土地像“天下第一田”一样的实现大方园田化，一个大搞园田化为中心的群众运动，以排山倒海之势开展了起来。继“天下第一田”之后，又在南楼底村南创建了“万亩棉田方”，这个方比“天下第一田”的工程还大得多。公社组织了七千多名男女社员，用了半月的时间，削平了窑疙瘩，填平了大水沟，对万亩土地进行了深翻和平整，成为一马平川的大片园田。就是这样，全社干部和社员辛勤劳动了一冬一春，把十一万多亩耕地连成了大片，进行了平整，建立了统一的灌溉系统，建立了这村通那村、这田通那田的公路网。
              一把钥匙开两锁
    建设大方园田化的速度为什么这样快？人们说，人民公社像一把万能钥匙，把高级合作社在建设大面积园田化中开不开的两把锁打开了。
    伍仁桥公社境内因河流较多，千百年的淤积和冲刷，造成了土地不平。要实现大面积园田化，平整土地就成为一个特别重要的任务。但是这个任务，高级社时因劳力不足，难以办到。原来的南楼底高级社一成立，就想搞三千亩地的大面积园田，每亩土地需用二十个工，全部平整完需要六万个工。可是全社只有三百多个劳动力，每个劳动力需做二百个劳动日。这一计算，就把一部分生产队吓住了。李桂林生产队的决心大干劲足，可是当搞到四、五十亩的时候，别的农活已经受到不小的影响，还是不得不停止下来。人民公社成立以后，把劳动力不足的第一把锁打开了。公社统一组织劳动力进行大协作，解决了劳动力缺乏的问题。公社领导上一方面抓住冬春两季，组织劳动力全面向园田化进军，还根据各生产队因作物种植不同而出现的忙闲不均的机会，开展大协作。秋末，滋河以北的生产队80％的土地种麦，滋河以南的生产队种麦任务只占土地面积的20％。为了突击搞好滋河以北万亩小麦园田方，就组织滋河以南十多个生产队的近万名劳动力去支援；春初，出现了相反的情况，滋河以南春播任务大，滋河以北春播任务小，于是又组织滋河以北二十多个生产队，七千多个劳动力去支援，四千亩高洼不平的土地很快变成了整齐平整的棉田方。
    社与社间的插花田与建立大面积园田化的矛盾，也是高级社时很头痛的事。原高级社基本上一村一社，社与社之间的土地犬牙交错。北楼底想在村南搞园田化，可是中间有伍仁桥的一块土地；而伍仁桥想在村南建园田方，北楼底的一块块土地却七长八短地插在方田之中。因为土地由两个社各自经营，虽然几次商谈调换，总是纠缠不清。这两块园田，一年的时间谁也没有搞成。同时，各社原来搞园田化时，因不能统一规划，在修建道路时都根据自己的方便行事，结果许多道路村与村对不上路口，造成这村与那村行走不便，许多废弃的道路不得不重新走起来。公社化后，这些矛盾就迎刃而解了。公社在全面安排、统一规划下，本着生产队与生产队大体合理和有利于生产发展的原则下，按照大方园田化的规划，适当地调换了土地，统一规划了道路。这样一来，不仅方田整齐，道路畅通，而且种地也方便了。
        大方园田化具有无比优越性
    伍仁桥人民公社实行了大方园田化后，受到了广大社员异口同声的好评：
    一、便于机械操作，为农业机械化、电气化创造了良好的条件。大方园田化具有地块大、地面平、种植合乎规格等特点，拖拉机、播种机、收割机在作业时可以少转弯、少转移地块，因此，可以大大发挥效能。根据公社化前和公社化后使用同样的拖拉机、同样耗油量、同样耕作时间的比较，公社化前一台拖拉机一个班次耕地三十五亩；公社化后一个班次耕地五十亩，提高效率40％。拖拉机手们说：“在大方园田上工作真痛快，这才真是‘铁牛’显威风的时候哩！”
    二、便于实现水利化和灌溉机械化。在建立适合大方园田化的水利设施上，公社根据大方园田的规划，合理安排了打机井的位置和数量。全社很快打成了机井三百四十眼。同时，公社又发动群众投资献料，并从公共积累中抽出一部分资金，使全社的排灌机械由二百零三台增到二百五十台。在由公社统一掌握渠道用水的数量和合理安排用水的时间以后，渠道用水的矛盾也消除了。
    三、便于因地制宜，能大大发挥土地的潜力。大方园田化具备了统一规划种植的优越性，可以根据大方园田的土质情况，分配和确定种植的作物。例如，奉伯生产队，本来村南是黑土，适合种玉米，不适合种白薯；而村北是沙土，适合种白薯，不适合种玉米。可是因为各高级社的土地不能统一规划，种植不合理的现象长期存在；大方园田化以后，经过逐步普查土壤，干部和社员对每方土地性质心里有了底，再加上种植区域化，根据各生产队的种植计划，分配经营大方园田。这样，改变了原来土地利用不合理的情况，原来每亩只产二千斤白薯的黑土地，1959年种的玉米亩产量达到八百多斤；原来亩产只有一百多斤玉米的沙土地，1959年亩产五千多斤白薯，只这一项就增产十多万斤粮食。
    四、便于推广新技术。农业技术员们说：为适应大方园田化带来的种植区域化的需要，每块大方园田中都组织了干部、技术员、老农参加的技术研究站，并负责种植一定数量的试验田。这样就便于就地试验，就地比较，就地推广，就地指导，就地交流经验。一年来，全公社十一万多亩的土地上，全部实现了合理密植、优种、防除病虫害等新的管理措施。
    五、便于科学地组织、调配劳动力，提高劳动生产率。由于采取了一方多队，一队多方的管理方法，这样就给组织竞赛、组织检查评比创造了很好的条件。同时，因为大方园田整齐，也便于计划劳动定额。随着大方园田化的实现，也建成了这方田通那方田、这村通那村的公路网，对提高运输效率，节省人力、畜力也起到了很大的作用。
    六、使原来一部分因为土质不好产量低的穷队，在实现大方园田化以后，产量迅速提高。卓头生产队原来的洼碱地只能种一季庄稼，产量很低。建成大方园田化后，实现了机耕、机械灌溉，单位面积产量一跃而居全社最先进的水平。
    大方园田化具有巨大的优越性，在公社化的第一年，就战胜了严重的旱、涝灾害，获得了空前大丰收。全社种粮食作物七万七千多亩（其中有一万八千多亩受水灾），平均亩产一千零九十二斤；棉花二万七千亩，平均亩产皮棉六十多斤。1959年粮食单位面积产量比1958年增长57％，棉花增长55.5％。
    农业生产大丰收，提高了人民的生活，提供了更多的农产商品。只粮食一项，就向国家交售了两千万斤，比1958年增加40％。还有二百九十万斤棉花，一千万斤蔬菜，五百万斤大葱。随着公社和社员收入的增加，公共积累也扩大了。现在全社已建成了一个拥有二十六台拖拉机、十六台联合收割机、九台脱谷机和四百五十台大小机械的拖拉机站。
