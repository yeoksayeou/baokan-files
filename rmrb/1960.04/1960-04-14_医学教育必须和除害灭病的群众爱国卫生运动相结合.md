Comrades, Representatives:

We fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 draft state budget, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program (revised draft) ahead of schedule, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

As early as 1956, the Party Central Committee proposed in the National Agricultural Development Program (revised draft) that the four pests should be basically eliminated within twelve years, and the diseases that most seriously harm the people should be basically eliminated. It also proposed to carry out regular patriotic health campaigns. It believes that this is a magnificent task of transforming customs and habits and transforming the world. In the past few years, especially in 1958 and 1959, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, with the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production and the consolidation and development of people's communes, there has also been a great leap forward in national health work. At present, the four pests have been greatly reduced, and smallpox, plague, and kala-azar, which seriously endanger the people, have been basically eliminated. Other serious diseases that endanger the people are rapidly shrinking and accelerating their elimination. All parts of the country are learning from Jishan, catching up with Jishan, and surpassing Jishan; learning from Foshan, catching up with Foshan, and surpassing Foshan. The mass patriotic health campaign of the whole people eliminating the four pests and the 600 million people bidding farewell to the god of plague has once again appeared with a new upsurge of vigorous development. Practice has proved that under the leadership of the Party, as long as we adhere to the mass movement, adhere to the combination of health work and production, adhere to the combination of technical personnel and the masses, and continue to leap forward, the four pests will certainly be eliminated, and the serious diseases that endanger the people will certainly be eliminated. The combat mission of transforming our people's weak physique into a strong and healthy body, transforming customs and habits, and transforming the world will certainly be realized ahead of schedule. The excellent situation of the great leap forward in national health work makes us medical educators feel extremely excited and encouraged. At the same time, it also makes us feel a greater responsibility. We must redouble our efforts to cultivate a large number of health cadres who are both red and expert and determined to transform customs and habits and transform the world, so as to keep up with the needs of the development of the situation. Now we would like to express some opinions on the issue of integrating medical education with the patriotic health campaign to eliminate pests and diseases.

In the past two years, under the leadership of the Party, our Chinese and Western medical colleges and universities have implemented and carried out the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and the combination of education and productive labor, thoroughly criticized the fallacy that "medical education is special, and laymen cannot lead experts" and that the Party's leadership is not needed. It has reversed the bourgeois direction of medical education that is divorced from politics, divorced from the masses, and divorced from reality, and carried out an educational revolution, resulting in a comprehensive leap forward in teaching, medical treatment, and scientific research. In the great leap forward in our Chinese and Western medical colleges and universities, the most prominent issue is that teachers and students stepped out of the school, went deep into the countryside and factories, and actively participated in the mass patriotic health campaign, so that medical education was combined with the mass patriotic health campaign. This has caused profound changes in many aspects of the school and constantly promoted the revolution and leap forward in medical education.

First of all, the political ideology and mental outlook of teachers and students have undergone profound changes. The socialist and communist ideological awareness of the majority of teachers and students has been greatly improved. In the past, doctors were "superior" and waited for patients to seek medical treatment. Now they are delivering medical care to their doorsteps, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and doing everything for the patients. In the struggle to eliminate pests and diseases, there have been countless vivid and moving examples of risking wind and rain, defying cold and heat, traveling across mountains and rivers, and sacrificing oneself to save patients. Many workers and peasants said with emotion: "These are really good doctors trained by Chairman Mao. We must work hard to produce and repay the care of the Party and Chairman Mao." The change in the mental outlook of teachers and students has promoted the continuous leap forward in various tasks of the school. A large number of advanced workers and advanced collectives have emerged. The school presents a scene of vigorous vitality.

Secondly, the quality of medical education has been significantly improved. In the practice of the mass patriotic health campaign to eliminate pests and diseases, guided by dialectical materialism, rich experience has been continuously summarized, teaching methods have been improved, and teaching content has been enriched. More importantly, through continuous practice, summarization, and improvement, some new theoretical viewpoints have been put forward, and these new theoretical viewpoints have been used to replace some of the original metaphysical idealist viewpoints in medicine. This has promoted the further development of teaching reform and teaching revolution. In the past, students were "reading books to death, reading dead books." Now, combined with practice, they have learned to read books in a lively way, and their ability to solve practical problems has been significantly improved. Because of the difficulties encountered in practice, teachers and students are forced to work together to explore, changing the past state of only teachers lecturing and students listening. Now students also use their brains to think about problems and solve difficult problems. Under the leadership of the Party, a new teacher-student relationship has been formed in which teachers and students combine and teach each other. The growth of young teachers and students has been accelerated.

Third, scientific and technological research work in medicine has been carried out on an unprecedented scale. There are more scientific research topics, the content is rich and colorful, and the teachers, students, and masses participating in scientific and technological research are more extensive. In the past, a school had only a dozen or dozens of scientific papers a year, but now it has hundreds or thousands of papers. More importantly, in the past, scientific research was only limited to laboratories and hospitals. Now, in addition to conducting scientific and technological research in laboratories and hospitals, it has also increased the aspect of combining with the actual struggle of the broad masses to eliminate pests and diseases. This enables the results of scientific research to be quickly tested in practice, and also raises many new theoretical and practical problems, promoting the development of scientific research in the direction of tackling cutting-edge technologies and climbing to peaks.

The idea of prevention first has been strengthened in medical and health work. In the past, emphasis was placed on treatment in hospitals. Now, hospitals are used as the center to combine and guide the health and prevention work of factories, mines, and communes. The level of medical technology in hospitals has also been improved.

In the mass patriotic health campaign, teachers and students personally saw the remarkable curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine and the great role it played in safeguarding people's health. They further broke down the bourgeois one-sided and narrow view of underestimating and discriminating against traditional Chinese medicine, increased their enthusiasm for learning traditional Chinese medicine, learned traditional Chinese medicine treatment methods, increased their knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine, and further promoted the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, which is more conducive to sorting out and carrying forward traditional Chinese medicine and creating a new school of medicine in our country.

In short, we believe that teachers and students stepping out of the school, going deep into the countryside and factories, and participating in the mass patriotic health campaign to eliminate pests and diseases is one of the most important links in developing and improving our country's medical education. It is not only conducive to teachers and students achieving fundamental transformation in the "red" aspect, but also conducive to rapid improvement in the "expert" aspect. On the one hand, teachers and students of medical colleges and universities participate in the mass patriotic health campaign, which combines health and medical personnel with the broad masses, forming a combination of the Party's leadership and health and medical technical personnel and the masses, promoting the in-depth and extensive development of the mass patriotic health campaign. At the same time, it also popularizes and develops medical education, and takes various forms such as full-time, part-time, and amateur to train a large number of high, primary, and intermediate-level health backbones and mass activists, which is conducive to the continuous improvement of the mass patriotic health campaign and is welcomed by the masses. On the other hand, teachers and students of medical colleges and universities participate in the mass patriotic health campaign, which combines medical education with productive labor and the mass patriotic health campaign. This is conducive to combining the efforts to study, research, and master the world's latest medical science and technology achievements with summarizing the rich experience of mass practice, promoting the continuous revolution in medical education, promoting the rapid development of medical science and technology in tackling cutting-edge technologies and climbing to peaks, and promoting the creation of a new school of medicine. However, in our medical colleges and universities, due to the influence of bourgeois ideology, not everyone can recognize this problem. Some people oppose the systematic medical theory education and the practical education of eliminating pests and diseases and the mass patriotic health campaign, instead of combining them. They cannot see the positive role of the combination of the two in complementing each other and promoting each other. They cannot see the benefits of the combination of the two for the great revolution, great development, and great improvement of medical education. They do not fully understand that regular systematic theoretical education is of course important in medical education, and it is also completely necessary to spend a certain appropriate amount of time each year to participate in the mass patriotic health campaign for practical education. We believe that this issue is the issue of medical education serving proletarian politics, combining with productive labor, and combining with the actual struggle of the masses; it is also the issue of the different paths of running medical education by the bourgeoisie and running medical education by the proletariat; it is a

    医学教育必须和除害灭病的群众爱国卫生运动相结合

  各位代表：
    我们完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，谭震林副总理关于为争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）而奋斗的报告和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    党中央早在1956年全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）中就提出，要在十二年内基本上消灭四害，基本上消灭危害人民最严重的疾病，要开展群众的经常性的爱国卫生运动；并且认为这是一项移风易俗改造世界的宏伟任务。这几年来，特别是1958、1959两年来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，随着全国工农业生产大跃进和人民公社的巩固和发展，全国卫生工作也出现了大跃进。目前，四害已经大大减少，严重危害人民的天花、鼠疫、黑热病已被基本消灭，其他严重危害人民的疾病正在急剧缩小和加速消灭中。全国各地正在学稷山、赶稷山、超稷山，学佛山、赶佛山、超佛山，全民动手除四害，六亿神州送瘟神的群众爱国卫生运动，再次出现了蓬勃开展的新高潮。实践证明，在党的领导下，只要我们坚持群众运动，坚持卫生工作和生产相结合，坚持技术人员和群众相结合，不断的跃进，四害一定能够除掉，危害人民的严重疾病一定能够消灭，变我国人民低弱体质为身体康强、移风易俗改造世界的战斗任务，一定能够提前实现。全国卫生工作跃进的大好形势使我们医学教育工作者感到无比兴奋和鼓舞，同时，也使我们更感到责任重大。我们一定要加倍努力，多快好省的培养出大批又红又专、立志移风易俗改造世界的卫生干部，跟上形势发展的需要。现在我们仅就医学教育必须和除害灭病的群众爱国卫生运动相结合的问题发表一些意见。
    两年来，我们中西医学院校，在党的领导下，贯彻执行了党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，彻底批判了“医学教育特殊，外行不能领导内行”，不要党的领导的谬论，扭转了医学教育脱离政治、脱离群众、脱离实际的资产阶级方向，进行了教育革命，出现了教学、医疗、科学研究的全面大跃进。在我们中西医学院校的大跃进中，最突出的一个问题是：师生跨出校门，深入农村，深入厂矿，积极参加群众爱国卫生运动，使医学教育与群众爱国卫生运动相结合，这就引起了学校中许多方面的深刻变化，不断的促进医学教育的革命和跃进。
    首先，师生的政治思想精神面貌起了深刻的变化。大多数师生的社会主义、共产主义思想觉悟大为提高。过去医生是“高人一等”，坐等病人求医的。现在是送医上门，为工农服务，一切为了病人。在除害灭病的斗争中，出现了为抢救病人不避风雨，不畏寒暑，历山涉水，牺牲个人，无数生动感人的事例。许多工农群众感动的说：“这真是毛主席培养出来的好医生，今后一定要努力生产，报答党和毛主席的关怀”。师生精神面貌的改变，促进了学校各项工作不断跃进。先进工作者和先进集体大批涌现。学校呈现一片朝气蓬勃的新气象。
    其次，医学教育的质量显著提高了。在群众爱国卫生运动除害灭病的实践中，以辩证唯物主义思想为指导，不断的总结出丰富的经验，改进了教学方法，充实和丰富了教学内容。更重要的是经过不断的实践、总结、提高，提出了一些新的理论观点，并且以这些新的理论观点去代替医学中原来的某些形而上学唯心主义观点，这就促进了教学改革、教学革命进一步的开展。过去学生是“死读书，读死书”，现在结合了实践，书读活了，解决实际问题的能力明显的提高了。由于在实践中遇到了难题，迫使师生结合起来进行探讨，改变了过去只是先生讲学生听的状态。现在学生也开动脑筋想问题，动手解决疑难问题。在党的领导下，形成了师生结合、教学相长新的师生关系。青年教师和学生的成长加快了。
    第三，医学科学技术研究工作空前开展。科学研究的题目多了，内容丰富多彩，参加科学技术研究的师生和群众广泛了。过去一个学校一年科学论文只有十几篇、几十篇，现在是几百篇、上千篇。更重要的是过去科学研究只是局限在实验室和医院中进行，现在除了在实验室和医院中大搞科学技术研究外，还增加了和广大群众性的除害灭病实际斗争相结合的一面。这就使科学研究的成果迅速得到实践检验，并且提出许多新的理论和实践问题，促进科学研究向攻尖端、攀高峰的方向发展。
    在医疗预防工作上预防为主的思想加强了。过去强调在医院内治疗，现在是以医院为中心结合指导厂矿和公社的卫生预防工作。医院内医疗技术水平也提高了。
    在群众爱国卫生运动中，师生亲眼看到祖国医学的显著疗效和保卫人民健康所起的巨大的作用，进一步破除了轻视、歧视祖国医学的资产阶级片面狭隘观点，提高了学习中医的积极性，学习了中医治疗方法，增加了中医知识，进一步促进了中西医结合，更有利于整理和发扬祖国医学，创立我国新医学派。
    总之，我们认为，师生跨出校门，深入农村、厂矿，参加除害灭病的群众爱国卫生运动，是发展和提高我国医学教育最重要的环节之一，不仅有利于师生在“红”的方面取得带根本性的改造，而且也有利于在“专”的方面得到迅速的提高。一方面，医学院校师生参加了群众爱国卫生运动，就把卫生医药人员和广大群众结合起来了，形成了党的领导和卫生医药技术人员、群众的三结合，促进了群众爱国卫生运动深入广泛的开展，同时，还普及和发展了医学教育，采取脱产、半脱产、业余等各种形式培养大批的高、初、中级卫生骨干和群众积极分子，有利于群众爱国卫生运动的不断提高，受到群众的欢迎。另一方面，医学院校师生参加了群众爱国卫生运动，就把医学教育和生产劳动和群众爱国卫生运动三者结合起来了，这就有利于把努力学习、研究和掌握世界最新的医学科学技术成就和总结群众实践的丰富经验结合起来，促进医学教育不断革命，促进医学科学技术攻尖端、攀高峰的迅速发展，促进新医学派的创立。但是，在我们医学院校中，由于资产阶级思想的影响，还不是所有的人都能认识到这一问题。有些人，把进行系统的医学理论教育和进行除害灭病、群众爱国卫生运动的实际教育对立起来，而不是结合起来。他们看不到两者结合起来相辅相成、互相促进的积极作用。他们看不到两者结合起来对医学教育大革命、大发展、大提高的好处。他们还不完全懂得在医学教育中经常的系统的理论教育当然是重要的，每年拿出一定的适当的时间，参加群众爱国卫生运动进行实际教育也是完全必要的。我们认为这一问题，是医学教育为无产阶级政治服务，与生产劳动相结合，与群众的实际斗争相结合的问题；也是资产阶级办医学教育和无产阶级办医学教育不同的两条道路的问题；是必须彻底辩清的大问题。毛主席教导我们说过：“高等学校应该抓住三个东西：一是党委领导；二是群众路线；三是把教育和生产劳动结合起来。”我们要更高的举起毛泽东思想旗帜，大力开展毛泽东著作的学习，认真学习和领悟党中央和毛主席对于卫生医药工作的指示，不断的进行思想革命，不断的总结医学教育工作，为多快好省的培养出又红又专、立志移风易俗改造世界的卫生干部而斗争。
    以上意见是否有当，请各位代表指正。
