(Our newspaper, Hefei, 7th) The Tongda People's Commune in Lujiang County, Anhui Province, based on the characteristics of the polder area, has adopted the measure of "taking rice as the key link and diversifying economic activities in the water," arranging various productions and implementing the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations very well.

This commune is a polder area and a famous rice-producing area in Lujiang County, where two crops of rice can be grown a year. To fully exploit the land potential, the commune decided to expand the area of double-cropping rice from 21,000 mu last year to 44,000 mu.

Using all the paddy fields for rice cultivation created a contradiction with the development of diversified operations. Last year, the net income from diverse economic activities accounted for 44.2% of the commune's total income. The reason why diversified operations achieved such great results was mainly due to the full utilization of the water surface. This year, the commune's Party committee decided to further utilize the water surface to develop diversified economic activities to solve the contradiction of lacking cultivated land for developing diversified operations. The two major rivers and hundreds of small rivers and large ditches running through the commune have a total water area of about 10,000 mu. This year, multi-purpose use of the water is implemented. In addition to utilizing all the water surface for fish farming, aquatic plants such as water chestnuts are also planted. Reeds, cattails, and water chestnuts are planted on the riverbanks. In addition, 15,000 mu of rice fields are used for fish farming, and more than 5,000 mu of lake beaches outside the polder and water beaches inside the polder are used to plant reeds. The commune can raise 45 million fish, produce 100,500 dan of water chestnuts, 40,000 dan of water chestnuts, 450,000 dan of reeds, and 40,000 dan of cattails by utilizing these water surfaces, lake beaches, and rice fields. The total income from aquatic products of the commune this year can reach 6,355,000 yuan, accounting for 63% of the total income from diversified economic activities.

While fully utilizing the water surface to develop diversified economic activities, the commune fully utilizes the gaps in front and behind houses, roadsides, and ditch ridges, as well as methods such as merging small polders into large polders, merging small fields into large fields, and filling in unnecessary rivers to expand cultivated land and plant a large number of economic crops such as vegetables, fruit trees, and tung oil trees. As a result, while the area of food crops in the commune has expanded, diversified economic activities have also been comprehensively developed. The area used by the commune to develop diversified economic activities by utilizing water surfaces, lake beaches, water beaches, scattered land, and newly reclaimed land has reached more than 47,000 mu, an increase of more than 36,000 mu compared with last year. In addition, the commune vigorously developed poultry and livestock breeding this year (planned to raise 110,000 pigs and 1.6 million poultry, an increase of 7.3 times and 5.7 times respectively compared with last year). The total output value of diverse economic activities this year can reach 21,030,000 yuan, an increase of nearly three times compared with last year.

After the Tongda People's Commune greatly increased grain production and comprehensively developed diversified economic activities, the amount of work required increased significantly. Under these circumstances, the commune vigorously carried out tool reform. Now, 39 new types of agricultural tools have been promoted, and the work efficiency has generally increased by three to twenty times, saving a lot of labor. At the same time, the commune unified the labor needed for various productions. Among the more than 14,000 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in the commune, under normal circumstances, more than 1,400 laborers with certain skills (accounting for 10% of the total labor force) are drawn out and organized into specialized teams to engage in diversified operations. During the busy farming season, 4% to 5% of the labor force is arranged to engage in diversified operations. When the peak season for diversified economic activities arrives, 20% of the labor force is invested in diversified operations.

The commune also cleverly staggered the busy and slack seasons of agriculture and diversified operations. For example, planting water chestnuts and planting cattails are all before the transplanting of early rice, and the harvest is just after the harvesting of mid-season rice and before the harvesting of late rice, which are not in the busy season.

Now, the various production tasks of the Tongda People's Commune have been implemented in the production teams, and the "three guarantees" work has been completed. 90% of the labor force of all production teams in the commune have been invested in intensive spring plowing and summer harvest crop management activities, and more than 60 specialized teams engaged in diversified operations are also seizing the key spring season to vigorously carry out various preparations for developing diversified economic activities.

    因地制宜　统一安排　全面发展
    同大公社以粮为纲多种经济作物
    双季稻面积将扩大一倍，多种经济总产值可增长三倍
    本报合肥7日电　安徽省庐江县同大人民公社根据圩区的特点，采取“以水稻为纲，多种经济下水”的措施，安排各项生产，很好地贯彻了以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营的方针。
    这个公社是个圩区，又是庐江县著名的水稻产区，一年可种两季水稻。为了充分发挥土地潜力，公社决定将双季稻的面积由去年的二万一千亩扩大到四万四千亩。
    把水田全部用来种植水稻以后，便和发展多种经营发生了矛盾。这个公社去年多种经济的纯收入，占全社总收入的44.2％。多种经营所以获得这样大的成绩，主要是充分利用了水面。今年，公社党委决定进一步利用水面发展多种经济，以解决发展多种经济缺乏耕地的矛盾。贯串社里的两条大河以及几百条小河、大沟渠，总的水面约达一万亩，今年实行一水多用，除将全部水面利用起来养鱼外，还放植菱角等水生植物。在河边上种芦苇、蒲草、茭瓜，另外还利用一万五千亩稻田养鱼，五千多亩圩外的湖滩和圩内的水滩种芦苇。全社利用这些水面、湖滩和稻田，可养鱼四千五百万尾，产菱角十万零五千担，茭瓜四万担，芦苇四十五万担，蒲草四万担。全社今年水产的总收入可达六百三十五万五千元，占多种经济总收入的63％。
    这个公社在充分利用水面发展多种经济的同时，充分利用屋前屋后、路边沟埂的空隙地，以及采用小圩并大圩，小田并大田，填平用不着的河道等办法，扩大耕地，大量种植蔬菜、果木、油桐等经济作物。结果，在全社粮食作物面积扩大的同时，多种经济也得到了全面的发展。全社利用水面、湖滩、水滩、零星地和新垦地发展多种经济的面积达四万七千多亩，比去年扩大了三万六千多亩；加上今年全社大力发展禽畜饲养业（计划养猪十一万头，养家禽一百六十万只，分别比去年增长七点三倍和五点七倍），今年多种经济总产值可达二千一百零三万元，比去年增长近三倍。
    同大人民公社在大幅度地增产粮食，全面地发展多种经济后，需要的工作量大大增加。在这种情况下，这个社大力进行了工具改革。现在已推广了三十九种新式农具，工效一般提高了三倍到二十倍，节约了大量劳动力。同时公社统一安排了各项生产需要的劳力，在全社一万四千多个整半劳力中，在一般情况下，抽调出一千四百多个具有一定技术的劳动力（占总劳力的10％），组织成专业队，从事多种经营。农忙时安排4％到5％的劳动力，从事多种经营。到多种经济旺季到来时，安排20％劳力投入多种经营。
    这个社还把农业和多种经营的忙季与闲季巧妙地错开。例如，放菱角、种蒲草，都在早稻插秧以前，而收获时又正值中稻收割以后、晚稻收割以前，都不在大忙季节。
    现在，同大人民公社的各项生产任务已落实到生产队，并已结束了“三包”工作。全社各生产队90％的劳动力，都投入了紧张的春耕生产和夏收作物管理活动，六十多个从事多种经营的专业队，也抓紧春季这个关键性季节，大力进行发展多种经济的各项准备工作。
