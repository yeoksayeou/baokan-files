Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully endorse the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Over the past year, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the glorious illumination of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, China's socialist construction has achieved a great victory of continued Great Leap Forward.

Our Xiyou People's Commune in Yexian County, Shandong Province, is the same. In 1959, industrial and agricultural production and all construction undertakings achieved an unprecedented all-round Great Leap Forward. The situation this year is even better, and we will surely achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward. I would now like to report to the Congress on the industrial development of our commune:

Before liberation, let alone running industries in the countryside, most people had never even seen what a factory machine looked like. After liberation, we followed the direction pointed out by the Party and gradually embarked on the road of collectivization, step by step from low to high. Due to the needs of production development, we started to develop some industries sporadically, but even before the communization, there were only a few blacksmith shops and carpentry shops, which could only manufacture simple tools such as hoes, sickles, shovels, and mattocks.

After the people's commune was established, the situation changed greatly due to the transformation of the relations of production. In 1958, we started to vigorously develop commune-run industries, from scratch, from few to many. In just over a year, we built 29 commune-run factories, including machinery, chemical, fertilizer, lime, paper-making, oil extraction, vermicelli, wood industry, food, aquatic products, sewing, knitting, and weaving. Under the driving force of commune-run industries, small-scale industries such as repair, processing, and weaving in production teams also sprang up like mushrooms after a spring rain. There were more than 300 kinds of products. In terms of agricultural machinery, not only could repairs be done within the team for minor repairs and within the commune for major repairs, but also large and complex machines such as generators and threshers could be manufactured. In 1959, the total output value of commune-run industries reached 1.7 million yuan, an increase of 25 times compared with 1958. The great development of commune-run industries has not only greatly supported agricultural production and national economic construction, and met the needs of the people's lives, but also expanded and accelerated the development of the collective economy.

The reason why our commune's industry has developed so rapidly is mainly due to the correct leadership of the Party and the brilliant illumination of the General Line, relying on the superiority of the People's Commune with its "large size and high degree of public ownership," carrying out mass movements in a big way, giving full play to the wisdom and revolutionary vigor of the masses, and implementing the Party's policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture and the principles of "four serving," "three local," "two main," and "one self."

After the establishment of the People's Commune, the scale of our Xiyou Commune was greatly expanded. The commune has a total of 9,813 households and 35,509 people. This provides a solid material foundation for the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources. When we comprehensively implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in the whole commune, vigorously carried out water conservancy construction, developed diversified economy, and promoted the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, we encountered the contradiction that the labor force was insufficient, the tools were backward, and the leap forward needed could not be met. Our commune has 63,000 mu of cultivated land and 9,000 laborers, with an average of 7 mu of cultivated land per person. If calculated according to 18 workdays per mu of cultivated land per year, these laborers are not only sufficient but also have a large surplus. However, the development of diversified economy and welfare undertakings in the whole commune occupied 3,600 laborers, plus permanent farmland infrastructure construction and large-scale water conservancy, the actual labor force put into agriculture was only about 4,500. Especially, the replanting area of our commune accounts for more than 210%, and the harvest and planting time is strong, and the cadres and members of each team generally reflect and require to solve this problem. In order to solve this contradiction, we immediately mobilized the vast number of cadres and masses to carry out airing views, contending, and debating. Most people believed that only by vigorously developing commune-run industries, vigorously carrying out tool reforms, and realizing mechanization could we adapt to the needs of the development of new productive forces. But some people cannot see the strength of the commune and the infinite wisdom and potential of the vast masses. Some people advocate waiting for the country's mechanization to equip them. They think that "running industry is the business of urban workers, how can we farmers do this? It is better to sell more effort and not miss production." "Even if it can be done, tools and raw materials are not easy to solve." Some said: "The labor force is already insufficient, and if we engage in industry, we will have to abandon the land." Some people with capitalist ideas advocated "If you want to do it, do something that takes less effort and can make money." After airing views, debating, and studying the Party's complete set of two-legged walking policies, criticizing and overcoming the above-mentioned incorrect ideas, all cadres and members raised their awareness and realized the important role of commune-run industries in promoting the all-round Great Leap Forward of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. On the basis of raising thinking and unifying understanding, we immediately adopted the spirit of overall planning, comprehensive arrangement, and grasping the mobilization of the masses to rely on their own efforts and start from scratch, and quickly formed a vigorous mass upsurge of large-scale industry in the whole commune.

In the process of developing commune-run industries, we encountered many difficulties in terms of technology and materials. We firmly relied on the masses, carried out mass movements in a big way, and launched mass technical revolution movements in which everyone learns technology and everyone engages in creation. Of the 450 workers in our commune, except for 20 or so old workers, the rest are farmers who have just put down their hoes. In order to solve the technical problems, we focused on the key issues of production. While carrying out mass technical revolution movements, we also solved technical difficulties through sending people out, inviting people in, and methods such as masters teaching apprentices, holding on-site meetings for visits, and mutual teaching and mutual learning. Technical innovations have immediate results. In the past year, 72 kinds of tools have been reformed, 17 kinds of operation methods have been improved, and 6 kW and 25 kW indigenous generators and spring hammers have been successfully trial-produced. These new workers from peasant backgrounds have become a vital force on the industrial front. In terms of raw materials, if there is no raw materials, we make our own or use substitutes. For example, when we manufacture generators, we lack silicon steel sheets and copper wires. At that time, we mobilized the masses to purchase 2,500 old kerosene barrels and 1,700 jin of waste steel, and after processing, we made generators.

Over the past year or so, commune-run industries have fully demonstrated their great role:

First, it has greatly supported agricultural production. In the past year, commune-run industries have closely focused on the needs of production and vigorously carried out the manufacturing and repair of agricultural tools. Throughout the year, more than 1,300 large agricultural tools such as threshers, pulverizers, peanut shellers, deep plows, leap-forward drills, windmill waterwheels, and sprayers have been manufactured, and more than 20,000 medium and small agricultural tools have been manufactured, which has greatly supported agricultural production. Last summer, the 200 new-style weeding hoes and 162 three-tooth soil scrapers manufactured by the commune-run industry increased work efficiency by five to seven times, quickly completed the weeding and wasteland task, and ensured the normal growth of crops; in order to meet the needs of autumn planting, 277 various deep plows were manufactured to ensure the deep plowing specifications of 51,600 mu of wheat; Before the autumn harvest and autumn planting, 37 machine mills were manufactured, and all production teams in the commune installed machine mills, realizing the mechanization of milling, which is equivalent to the efficiency of 100 laborers and 100 livestock. During the autumn harvest and autumn planting period alone, the commune saved more than 7,000 manpower and livestock power each, greatly accelerating the progress of autumn harvest and autumn planting. It also manufactured 92 windmill waterwheels and reformed more than 550 old waterwheels. These water tools played a huge role in watering winter wheat and fighting against wheat returning green, which not only saved a lot of manpower and livestock power, but also increased work efficiency by 70% to 100%, ensuring that all wheat fields were watered with high-yield water. In addition, commune-run industries also produced more than 35 million jin of various indigenous chemical fertilizers and 65,000 jin of bacterial fertilizers, which increased fertilizers for crops. At the same time, it also carried out the repair and repair business of agricultural tools. In the busy farming season, it organized mobile repair and repair teams to go deep into the fields for repair and repair. In the past year, it repaired and repaired more than 40,000 agricultural tools. In short, all this has not only promoted the current development of production, but also laid the foundation for the realization of the four modernizations of agriculture.

Secondly, it also supported the country's economic construction, processing more than 15,000 pieces of bearings and automobile hooks for state-owned industries. It burned 180,000 bricks and more than 150 tons of lime, overfulfilling the tasks assigned by the state and supporting the country's economic construction. In addition, it processed 34,280 jin of vermicelli, more than 7,500 pairs of straw sandals, and 80,000 straw hats to support the country's export needs.

Thirdly, in terms of serving the lives of commune members, in order to consolidate and improve rural public canteens, commune-run machinery factories created 90 vegetable cutting machines, 85 vegetable rubbing machines, 85 indigenous tap water facilities, 98 wowotou machines, and 20 drawer cages. Now the public canteens of each production team have implemented semi-mechanization. This alone has saved 385 female laborers for the whole commune and improved the quality of cooking.

In addition, in the past year, it has also produced more than 90,000 kinds of shoes, socks, clothing, hats, and children's toys, and processed more than 30,000 pieces of ready-made clothes for commune members. It not only met the needs of the lives of commune members, but also transferred more than 16,000 pieces to meet the needs of the market.

Fourth, the development of industry has provided conditions for vigorously engaging in technical revolution and realizing the four modernizations of agriculture, further liberating the minds of the masses, eliminating the mysterious views on technology, and reflecting one after another: "There is nothing difficult in the world, as long as you are determined." The fact is indeed the case: Li Zhiting, a worker in the machinery factory, was originally a sewing worker and did not understand electricity at all. He has only been a machinery worker for more than a year, but he has made up his mind to manufacture generators. Although there were no drawings or equipment at that time, after more than 20 days of painstaking research and repeated research, he finally made a generator, which is now generating electricity for lighting. At present, Li Zhiting is further researching technology and is determined to manufacture more complex machines such as electric motors, transformers, and electric welders. In agriculture, he has manufactured many new-style agricultural tools and important agricultural machinery. In particular, through the development of commune-run industries, cadres and workers have been trained for agricultural mechanization, rich technical experience has been accumulated, more than 200 agricultural machinery operators have been trained, and scientific research instruments such as wheat rust predictors have also been manufactured for agriculture. All this has created favorable conditions for vigorously engaging in technical revolution and realizing the four modernizations of agriculture.

In short, the development of our commune's industry is very fast and the situation is very good. The situation in 1960 is even better. With the high-speed development of agricultural production, the realization of agricultural mechanization is becoming more and more urgently needed. However, the current development of our commune's industry still cannot adapt to the current new situation, and the development of industrial production must be accelerated. Therefore, our commune's planned total output value for 1960 requires 3.18 million yuan, an increase of 87% compared with 1959. In terms of products, according to the requirements of realizing the four modernizations of agriculture, in addition to completing 112 small iron cows, 20 medium-sized threshers, 20 corn shellers, 150 corn planters, 20 weeding machines, 10 peanut shellers, 10 generators, 10 sweet potato slicers, 60 water turbines, 21 water mills, 300 meters of railway, 50 windmills, increase the production of large agricultural tools, and timely meet the supply of weeding hoes, sprayers, deep plows and small agricultural tools such as hoes, sickles, shovels, and mattocks, and continue to expand the production of living products such as sewing, knitting, tobacco and alcohol, cement, lime, sweets, edible oil, vermicelli, weaving, leather making, bacterial fertilizer and oil cakes to meet the needs of the production and life of the vast number of commune members. At the same time, continue to deeply implement the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on manual operation mechanization and semi-mechanization. In order to ensure the victory of this movement, we must first adhere to putting politics in command, deeply study Mao Zedong Thought, master the weapon of continuous revolution, be good at discovering the budding and advanced figures emerging in the movement, and cultivate and support them with full enthusiasm so that they can develop and grow rapidly. Highly promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. With the revolutionary courage to overcome difficulties, overcome difficulties, and never give up, actively and continuously carry out revolutionary experiments and research, expand the technical team and backbone force, establish amateur technical innovation groups and red and expert schools, carry out mass movements of offering suggestions, improve tools and improve equipment to arm their own factories in the spirit of hard work and skillful work, continue to deeply implement the policy of "four serving, three local, two main, one self," closely focus on the current agricultural production, vigorously carry out tool reforms such as water lifting, deep plowing, close planting, and cooking, and the production of indigenous chemical fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, and indigenous generators, and strive to realize the "four modernizations" ahead of schedule. In production, resolutely take the methods of taking materials locally, comprehensively utilizing local resources, facing the masses, and turning dead objects into living objects, greatly giving play to the spirit of cooperation, working together, and supporting each other to ensure the comprehensive development of production and technical innovation, and constantly organizing labor competitions, setting off a large-scale mass movement of inserting red flags, establishing pace-setters, learning from advanced, catching up with advanced, and helping backward, and promoting a better, more comprehensive, and continuous leap forward in commune-run industries.

Finally, I will briefly talk about the agricultural scientific research work of our commune:

Under the leadership of the Party and the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the scientific research work of our commune has also developed rapidly. From the technical group of the agricultural cooperative to the whole people running science, from simple experiments to more complex research. At present, the commune level has a Science and Technology Committee, an Agricultural Technology Station, a Red and Expert School, as well as a Tractor Station, a Meteorological Station, an Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Station, etc. All brigades have technical teams, agricultural machinery teams, and veteran farmer advisory committees, and all small teams have technicians or technical groups. Now the whole commune has 554 technicians with a junior agricultural school or higher education, more than 800 members of the Science Association, forming a systematic scientific and technical team from top to bottom. In recent years, according to the principle of scientific research starting from production and serving production, a large number of technical research and experimental work has been carried out. The number of scientific research experimental projects has reached more than 250, with more than 2,000 treatments. Dozens of treatments have been made for each word of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and scientific research has directly promoted the development of agricultural production. A series of reforms have been carried out in cultivation and cultivation techniques. For example, changing two crops in three years to two crops in one year increased the yield per mu by 250 jin; changing single planting to intercropping and intercropping. Now, except for wheat, all other crops are intercropped, and even cabbage and radish fields are intercropped with wheat. For example, intercropping corn with groundnuts increased the yield per mu by more than 500 jin compared with single planting of groundnuts, and intercropping soybeans with corn increased the yield by about 10% compared with single planting of corn. Changing sparse planting to reasonable close planting, the amount of wheat sown increased from 7 jin to 8 jin per mu in the past to 25 jin to 30 jin, corn increased from 2,000 plants per mu to 4,000 to 6,000 plants, and sweet potatoes increased from 2,500 plants in the past to more than 5,000 plants. Changing inferior seeds to improved varieties, the results of variety trials, cultivation, elimination, and renewal in recent years have enabled the whole commune to generally realize improved varieties, and improved varieties can generally increase production by 20% compared with the seeds used in the past. Changing the past practice of watering "life-saving water" to watering high-yield water according to the needs of crops for water at different stages of development; changing the past practice of single fertilizer elements and unreasonable fertilization methods to applying fertilizer elements according to the different needs of crops at different growth stages, dividing them into categories and appropriately combining different fertilizer elements. In addition, a series of reforms have also been carried out in cultivation and tillage, inter-tillage and weeding, field management, and pest and disease control after scientific research experiments. Before liberation, the yield per mu of grain in our commune was only about 200 jin. By 1957, the year before the establishment of the commune, the yield per mu reached 440 jin. In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, the yield per mu jumped to 621 jin. In 1959, the yield per mu increased by 36.3% compared with 1958. The rapid development of agricultural production is the result of the correct leadership of the Party, the continuous transformation of the relations of production, especially the establishment of the People's Commune, and at the same time, it is also inseparable from the achievements of scientific research. The development of agricultural scientific research has not only increased production, but also begun to combine physical labor and mental labor in production, and a new generation of people who can work, have knowledge, and have a communist ideological style is rapidly growing up, forming a situation in which teams conduct experiments and everyone learns science. Speaking science, learning science, and applying science have become a trend.

The preliminary achievements of scientific research in our commune have proved that the leadership of the Party and the General Line are completely correct, proved that the People's Commune has unparalleled superiority, and proved that the working masses of workers and peasants under the leadership of the Party can completely master science, and can master it even better. Of course, the scientific research work of our commune is still not done enough, and it is only the beginning. In order to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, we must continue to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out mass movements, and further develop scientific research work.

### 我们的社办工业和科学研究工作  徐建春代表的发言

专栏：

    我们的社办工业和科学研究工作
    徐建春代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告和人大常委会的工作报告。一年以来，我国社会主义建设事业，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的光辉照耀下，取得了继续大跃进的伟大胜利。
    我们山东掖县西由人民公社也是这样，1959年，工农业生产和各项建设事业都是史无前例的全面大跃进。今年的形势更好，必将取得更大更好更全面的大跃进。现仅就我社的工业发展情况，向大会作一汇报：
    农村办工业，解放前不要说办就是工厂机器是个啥样子，大多数人都没见过。解放后，我们沿着党所指引的方向，由低到高，一步一步地走上了合作化的道路。因为发展生产上的需要，开始零零星星的发展了一些工业，但直到公社化前，也只有几处铁匠炉和木匠铺，仅能制造一些锄、镰、锨、镢等简单工具。
    人民公社化后，由于生产关系的变革，情况就大大的不同了。1958年我们开始大办公社工业，从无到有，由少到多，在一年多的时间内，就白手起家建成了机械、化工、化肥、石灰、造纸、榨油、粉丝、木业、食品、水产、缝纫、针织、编制等二十九处社办工厂。在公社工业的带动下，生产队的修配、加工、编织等小型工业，也像雨后春笋一样发展起来，产品达三百余种，在农业机械方面，不仅修配作到了小修不出队，大修不出社，而且还能自制发电机、脱谷机等大型复杂的机器。1959年公社工业总产值达到一百七十万元，比1958年增长二十五倍。社办工业的大发展，不仅大大支援了农业生产，支援了国家经济建设，也满足供应了人民生活的需要，而且也扩大和加速了社有经济的发展。
    我社工业所以发展这样快，主要的是在党的正确领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，依靠人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，大搞群众运动，充分发挥了群众的智慧和革命干劲，执行了党的工农业同时并举的方针和“四为”、“三就”、“二主”、“一自”方针的结果。
    人民公社化后，我们西由公社的规模是大大扩大了，全社共九千八百一十三户，三万五千五百零九人。这对农、林、牧、副、渔的全面大发展，在人力、物力、财力等方面，都提供了雄厚的物质条件。当我们在全社范围内，全面贯彻“农业八字宪法”，大搞水利建设，发展多种经济，促进农林牧副渔全面大发展的生产运动中，遇到了劳力不足、工具落后与跃进需要不相适应的矛盾。我社的耕地是六万三千亩，劳力九千个，平均每人负担耕地七亩。如果按每亩耕地全年用工十八个计算，这些劳力不仅足用，并且大有剩余。但是，全社在发展多种经济和福利事业方面，就占去了三千六百个劳力，加上常年性的农田基本建设，大搞水利，实际投入农业的劳力只有四千五百个左右，特别是我社复种面积占210％以上，收种时间性强烈，各队干部和社员普遍反映和要求解决这一问题。为了解决这一矛盾，我们即发动广大干群进行鸣放争辩，大多数人认为，只有大办公社工业，大搞工具改革，实现机械化，才能适应新的生产力的发展的需要。但有的人看不到公社的力量和广大群众的无穷智慧和潜力。有的主张等国家的机械化来装备，他们认为“办工业是城市工人的事，咱们农民怎么能搞这个，还是多卖点力气，莫误了生产。”“就是能搞，工具原料也不好解决。”有的则说：“劳力本来不足，再搞工业就得扔地。”有些存有资本主义思想的人，就主张“要搞就搞点费事少、能赚钱的东西。”经过鸣放辩论和学习了党的一整套两条腿走路的方针，批判和克服了上述不正确的思想，全体干部、社员提高了觉悟，认识到社办工业对促进农、林、牧、副、渔全面大跃进的重大作用。在提高思想，统一认识的基础上，我们即采取统筹规划、全面安排和掌握发动群众自力更生，白手起家的精神，在全社范围内迅速形成了一个轰轰烈烈的众群性的大办工业高潮。
    在发展公社工业过程中，在技术和材料方面，又遇到不少困难，我们就紧紧依靠群众，大搞群众运动，开展了人人学技术，个个搞创造的群众性的技术革命运动，我社现有的四百五十名工人，除二十几名老工人外，其余都是刚刚放下锄头的农民，为了解决技术方面的问题，我们围绕生产的关键问题。在开展群众性的技术革命运动同时，并通过派出去，请进来的办法，以及师傅带徒弟，召开现场会议参观和互教互学的办法，解决了技术困难。技术革新立竿见影，一年来，改革工具七十二种，改进操作方法十七种，并试制成功了六瓩和二十五瓩的土发电机和弹簧锤。这些农民出身的新工人，已成了工业战线上的生力军。在原材料方面，没有的就自制自造或利用代用品，比如我们制造发电机的时候，缺乏釸钢片和铜丝，当时我们通过发动群众，收购了旧火油桶二千五百个，和废钢一千七百斤，经过加工后，制成了发电机。
    一年多以来，社办工业充分显示了它的巨大作用：
    首先是大大支援了农业生产，一年来公社工业紧紧围绕生产的需要，大搞农具制造和修配，全年共制成了脱谷机、粉碎机、花生脱皮机、深耕犁、跃进钻、风力水车、喷雾器等大型农具一千三百多件，中小型农具二万多件，大大地支援了农业生产。去年夏季，公社工业制造的二百部新式耘锄，一百六十二部三齿划土器，提高工效五至七倍，迅速完成了锄草灭荒任务，保证了作物的正常生长；为秋种的需要制造了各种深耕犁二百七十七部，保证了五万一千六百亩小麦深耕规格；秋收秋种前制成了机器磨三十七盘，全社各生产队都安上了机器磨，实现了磨面机械化，相等于一百个劳动力和一百个畜力的效率。仅秋收秋种期间，全社就节省人力、畜力各七千多个，大大地加快了秋收秋种的进度。还制成了风力水车九十二部，改制旧水车五百五十多部，这些水具在去冬小麦浇水和大战小麦返青关当中，起了巨大的作用，不仅节省了很多人力，畜力，而且提高工效百分之七十到百分之百，保证所有麦田浇上了丰产水。另外，公社工业还生产了各种土化肥三千五百余万斤，菌肥六点五万斤，为农作物增加了肥料。同时还开展了农具的修配业务，在农忙季节组织巡回修配组，深入田间，进行修配，一年来共修配了农具四万多件。总之这一切不仅推动了当前生产的发展，而且为农业实现四化打下了基础。
    其次，也支援了国家的经济建设，为国营工业加工了轴承、汽车挂钩等一万五千余件。烧砖十八万块，石灰一百五十多吨，超额完成了国家分配的任务，支援了国家的经济建设。另外加工了粉丝三万四千二百八十斤，草鞋七千五百多双，草帽编八万块的任务，支持了国家出口的需要。
    再次，在为社员生活服务方面，为了巩固提高农村公共食堂，社办机械厂创造了切菜机九十部，擦菜机八十五部，土自来水八十五处，窝窝头机九十八个，抽匣笼屉二十个，现在各生产队的公共食堂已实行了半机械化，就这一项，全社就节省了三百八十五个妇女劳力，而且提高了作饭质量。
    另外，一年来还生产了鞋袜、衣帽、儿童玩具九万多种，为社员加工了成衣三万多件。不仅满足了本社社员的生活需要，并外调了一万六千多件供应市场的需要。
    第四、工业的发展为大闹技术革命和实现农业四化提供了条件，使广大群众进一步解放了思想，破除了对技术的神秘观点，纷纷反映：“世上无难事，就怕心不专”。事实确是这样：机械厂工人李志亭原来是个缝纫工人，根本不懂电学，当机械工人只有一年多的时间，但他却立下雄心壮志，决心制造发电机，当时虽然一无图纸，二无设备，但经过二十多天的苦心钻研和反复研究，终于造出了发电机，现已发电照明，目前，李志亭正在进一步的研究技术，决心制造电动马达、变压器、电焊机等比较复杂的机器，在农业上制造了许多新式农具和重要的农业机械。特别是通过社办工业的发展，为农业机械化培养了干部和工人，积累了丰富的技术经验，训练了农业机械手二百多名，同时还为农业制造了小麦锈病予测器等科学研究仪器，这一切为大闹技术革命，实现农业四化创造了良好的条件。
    总之，我社工业的发展是很快的，形势是很好的，1960年的形势更好，随着农业生产高速度的发展，实现农业机械化越来越加迫切需要，但目前我社工业的发展，仍不能适应当前新的形势，工业生产的发展更须加快步伐，因此我社1960年的计划总产值要求三百一十八万元。比1959年增长87％，在产品方面根据农业实现四化的要求，除完成小铁牛一百一十二部，中型脱谷机二十部，玉米脱粒机二十部，玉米播种机一百五十部，锄草机二十部，花生脱皮机十部，发电机十部，地瓜切片机十部，水轮机六十部，水磨二十一部，铁道三百米，风力磨五十部，增加大型农具的生产，及时满足耘锄，喷雾器，深耕犁和锄、镰、锨、镢等小农具的供应，并继续扩大缝纫、针织、烟酒、水泥、石灰、糖果、食油、粉丝、编织、制革、菌肥和油饼等生活品生产，以满足广大社员生产生活的需要。同时，继续深入贯彻以手工操作机械化和半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。为确保这个运动的胜利，我们首先作到坚持政治挂帅，深入学习毛泽东思想，掌握不断革命论的武器，善于发现运动中涌现出来的萌芽和先进人物，满腔热情的去培养它、支持它，使它迅速发展壮大起来。高度发扬敢想，敢说，敢做的共产主义风格。以战胜困难，克服困难，百折不挠的革命勇气，积极不断的进行革命性的试验研究，扩大技术队伍和骨干力量，成立业余技术革新小组和红专学校，开展群众性的献计献策运动，以大干巧干的精神改进工具，改善设备来武装自己的工厂，继续深入地贯彻“四为、三就、二主、一自”的方针，紧紧围绕当前农业生产，大搞提水、深耕、密植、炊事等工具改革和土化肥、菌肥、土造发电机等生产，争取提前实现“四化”，在生产中坚决采取就地取材，综合利用当地资源，面向群众，变死物为活物的方法，大大发挥协作精神，共同努力，互相支援，以保证生产和技术革新的全面发展，经常不断的组织劳动竞赛，掀起一个插红旗，树标兵，学先进，赶先进，帮助后进的大规模的群众运动，促进社办工业更好更全面的持续跃进。
    最后，我再简单谈一下我社农业科学研究工作的情况：
    在党的领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，我社科学研究工作也有了迅速发展。从农业社时的技术小组发展到全民办科学，从简单的试验，发展到比较复杂的研究。目前，公社一级有科学技术委员会、农业技术站、红专学校以及拖拉机站、气象站、畜牧兽医站等，各大队都有技术队、农业机械队、老农顾问委员会，各小队都有技术员或技术小组。现在全社具有初级农校以上程度的技术员五百五十四人，科协会员八百多人，自上而下形成了一个系统的科学技术队伍。几年来，根据科学研究从生产出发、为生产服务的方针进行了大量的技术研究和试验工作，科学研究试验的项目已经达到二百五十多个，有二千多个处理。对农业“八字宪法”每一个字，都作了几十个处理，科学研究直接推动了农业生产的发展。在耕作和栽培技术等方面，进行了一系列的改革。如改二年三作为一年两作，亩产量增加二百五十斤；改单种单作为间种套作。现在，除小麦外，其他作物全部实行了间种，连白菜、萝卜地都套种了小麦，如地豆间作玉米，比单种地豆每亩增产五百多斤，玉米间作大豆比单种玉米增产10％左右。改稀植为合理密植，小麦播种量由过去的每亩七斤到八斤，提高到二十五斤到三十斤，玉米由每亩二千株增加到四千到六千株，地瓜由过去的二千五百株增加到五千株以上。改劣种为良种，几年来，进行品种试验、培育、淘汰、更新的结果，使全社普遍实现了良种化，优种一般比过去用的种子可增产20％。改过去浇“救命水”为根据作物在不同发育期对水分的需要浇丰产水；改过去单一肥素和不合理的施肥方法为根据作物在不同生育期对肥料的不同需要分次分类和不同肥素适当配合进行施肥。此外，在耕作整地、中耕除草、田间管理和防治病虫害等方面，经过科学研究试验，也都进行了一系列的改革。解放前，我社粮食亩产量不过二百斤左右，到公社化前一年——1957年，亩产量达到四百四十斤，大跃进的1958年，亩产量跃增到六百二十一斤，1959年，亩产量又比1958年增长了36.3％。农业生产的迅速发展，是党的正确领导的结果，是生产关系不断变革、特别是人民公社化的结果，同时，也是与科学研究的成果分不开的。农业科学研究的发展，不但增加了生产，而且，开始使生产中的体力劳动和脑力劳动结合起来，一代能劳动、有知识、具有共产主义思想风格的新人迅速成长起来，形成了一个队队搞试验、人人学科学的局面，讲科学、学科学、用科学已经成了风气。
    我社科学研究的初步成果，证明了党的领导和总路线完全正确，证明了人民公社具有无比优越性，证明了工农劳动群众在党的领导下完全能够掌握科学，而且能够掌握的更好。当然，我社科学研究工作还做得不够，还仅是开始，为了今年更大更好更全面的跃进，我们一定继续高举毛泽东思想红旗，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，把科学研究工作进一步开展起来。
