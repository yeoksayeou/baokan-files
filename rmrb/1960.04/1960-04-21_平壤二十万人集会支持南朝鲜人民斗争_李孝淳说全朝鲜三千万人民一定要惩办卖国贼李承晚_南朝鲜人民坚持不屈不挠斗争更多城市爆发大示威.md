　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 20th. More than 200,000 people in Pyongyang held a grand rally and demonstration parade today to support the South Korean people's struggle against the Syngman Rhee fascist rule.

　　This morning, workers, students, and citizens of Pyongyang, excited and inspired by the heroic actions of the Seoul people's uprising last night, sang revolutionary songs and shouted slogans as they came to Kim Il-sung Square from all directions. The people continuously shouted: "American troops get out of South Korea immediately!" "Down with the Syngman Rhee fascist clique!" "Support the South Korean people's just struggle!"

　　The meeting started at 11:00 a.m. Among those attending the meeting were: North Korean Deputy Premier Jeong Il-ryong, Korean Workers' Party Central Committee Vice Chairman Kim Chang-man, Supreme People's Assembly Chairman Choi Won-taek, Fatherland Front Central Presidium Chairman Kim Cheon-hae, and leaders of various democratic parties and social organizations.

　　Li Xiaochun, member of the Standing Committee of the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee, Chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions, and member of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front, spoke at the meeting. He said that the South Korean people's struggle against the Syngman Rhee fascist rule is like a prairie fire, sweeping across South Korea. He warmly praised the heroic actions of the students and citizens of Seoul in their uprising on the 19th, and the demonstration struggles launched by the people in various parts of South Korea.

　　Li Xiaochun said that due to the Syngman Rhee clique's criminal rule, South Korea has become a dark land and a living hell. This upsurge in the South Korean people's struggle is an outbreak of the South Korean people's long-standing resentment against the U.S.-Rhee group.

　　Li Xiaochun strongly condemned Syngman Rhee's crimes of bloody massacre against the South Korean people. He said that the Syngman Rhee clique has deployed puppet troops and tanks to suppress the demonstrating and uprising people in Seoul and other places, plunging the South Korean people into a pool of blood. Now all 30 million people of Korea are seething with anger and must punish the traitor Syngman Rhee!

　　Li Xiaochun said: "Syngman Rhee is using American-made tanks and guns to massacre our people. All the Korean people and the people of the world clearly see that U.S. imperialism is using its invading army to forcibly occupy South Korea and arm the Rhee puppet army. Who is this against? Who is it dealing with?"

　　Li Xiaochun said that this surging struggle of the South Korean people will continue until final victory. He called on all the South Korean people to rise up more bravely to fight in order to make the U.S. troops get out of South Korea and end Syngman Rhee's reign of terror. He called on the officers and soldiers of the South Korean "National Army" and the police to turn their guns and stand on the side of the people to fight against the Syngman Rhee clique. He said: "The day of final judgment for the traitor Syngman Rhee has arrived." He said that only by making U.S. imperialism withdraw and overthrowing the Syngman Rhee regime can the motherland be peacefully reunified.

　　Li Xiaochun said: "We appeal to the people of the world to stop the Syngman Rhee clique's brutal suppression of the South Korean people who are carrying out a just struggle, and to actively support and assist the South Korean people's just struggle."

　　Subsequently, representatives of youth students, workers, and farmers spoke at the meeting, expressing warm support for the struggle of the South Korean people. They unanimously said that the South Korean people must unite and wage an unyielding struggle. Unity is strength!

　　After the meeting, more than 200,000 people conducted a mighty demonstration parade on the main streets of Pyongyang. The thunderous slogans such as "Support the South Korean people's struggle," "Immediately release the arrested people," and "Immediately stop the Syngman Rhee clique's suppression of the people" resounded throughout Pyongyang.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 20th. Seoul News: Despite the Syngman Rhee clique's bloody and brutal suppression and "special martial law," the South Korean people continue to fight against the Syngman Rhee fascist rule today, and this struggle is spreading to more cities. Demonstrations were held today in nine cities including Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Jeonju, Suwon, Iri, and Cheongju, with more than 10,000 people participating in the demonstrations.

　　The Syngman Rhee clique has implemented strict censorship since 9:00 p.m. last night. Today, many newspapers in Seoul have many blank spaces, and reports from the South Korean News Agency have also been blocked. However, news of the South Korean people's unyielding struggle has still been revealed. According to reports, this morning, more than 200 citizens in Seoul attacked and destroyed two police stations. Subsequently, more than 200 students held demonstrations.

　　Last night, more than 150 demonstrators occupied and held the Seongbuk district of Seoul. Traffic to this area has been completely cut off. The insurgents are guarding this area with rifles and sticks seized from the police yesterday, making it impossible for Syngman Rhee's military police to enter. The two sides are in tense confrontation.

　　According to reports, another 2,000 students are persisting in fighting on Jeongneung Mountain in the suburbs of Seoul. The World News Agency reported that last night, a large number of demonstrators retreated to the outskirts of Seoul in more than a dozen jeeps and trucks seized from the police to persist in the struggle.

　　As a result of the Syngman Rhee clique's brutal massacre in Seoul yesterday and today, a total of 123 demonstrators were killed and more than 400 were injured. Today, Seoul is full of Rhee puppet troops and tanks armed with live ammunition, with strict security.

　　According to a report by the Hapdong News Agency this morning, yesterday, the demonstrators burned and destroyed a total of 14 agencies and 16 buildings in the ruling center of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. The demonstrators also burned or destroyed 22 vehicles of the Rhee puppet group and seized many vehicles.

　　At 10:00 a.m. this morning, in Jeonju, a major city in North Jeolla Province, more than 100 students from Jeonju University rushed out of the campus to hold a demonstration against the Syngman Rhee fascist rule.

　　In Incheon, more than 300 students also rushed out of the school this morning to hold a demonstration. They shouted: "No use of bayonets to crush democracy!" "Give our schools freedom!"

　　The heroic demonstrations of the people in Seoul and other places have dealt a heavy blow to the traitor Syngman Rhee and paralyzed the Rhee puppet ruling organization in Seoul. Syngman Rhee himself was panicked by the demonstration of tens of thousands of people who rushed to his residence yesterday. In addition to calling back from the front line a division of Rhee puppet troops carrying heavy weapons to Seoul, he also sent a large number of military police to protect him. Today, he ordered his military police to build barricades and set up machine guns in front of his residence, Gyeongmudae, and deployed a large number of military police armed with live ammunition, and also brought in tanks.

　　According to a report by Tonghwa News Agency, all agencies of the Rhee puppet regime in Seoul were panicked and paralyzed today. In the "Central Office," which was defeated by the demonstrators on the 19th, officials of the "Reconstruction Department," "Foreign Investment Department," and "Maritime Affairs Department" of the Rhee puppet regime were afraid of another attack by the masses, and everyone was preparing to escape at any time. Today, all "central government offices" of the Rhee puppet regime prohibited ordinary people from entering or leaving, and "employees were discussing in the office in an atmosphere of anxiety."

　　In a statement issued today, Syngman Rhee completely changed the tone of "severe suppression" he had been shouting a few days ago, and used deceptive means to say that "now is not the time to investigate the causes and responsibilities," and asked the people to "restore law and order."

    平壤二十万人集会支持南朝鲜人民斗争
    李孝淳说全朝鲜三千万人民一定要惩办卖国贼李承晚
    南朝鲜人民坚持不屈不挠斗争更多城市爆发大示威
    新华社平壤20日电　平壤市二十多万人民今天举行盛大集会和示威游行，支持南朝鲜人民反对李承晚法西斯统治的斗争。
    今天上午，为昨天晚上汉城人民大起义的英勇行为而兴奋鼓舞、情绪激昂的平壤市工人、学生、市民，高唱着革命歌曲，呼着口号，从四面八方来到金日成广场。人民不断地高呼：“美军从南朝鲜立即滚出去！”“打倒李承晚法西斯集团！”“支持南朝鲜人民正义斗争！”
    大会从上午十一时开始。参加大会的有：朝鲜内阁副首相郑一龙，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长金昌满，最高人民会议议长崔元泽，祖国战线中央议长团议长金天海和各民主政党、社会团体的负责人等。
    朝鲜劳动党中央常务委员会委员、职业总同盟中央委员会委员长、祖国战线中央委员李孝淳在会上讲了话。他说，南朝鲜人民反对李承晚法西斯统治的斗争，像燎原大火，烧遍了南朝鲜。他热烈赞扬19日汉城市学生、市民大起义的英勇行为和南朝鲜各地人民展开的示威斗争。
    李孝淳说，由于李承晚集团的罪恶统治，南朝鲜已成为黑暗的土地和人间地狱。这次南朝鲜人民斗争高潮是南朝鲜人民长期以来对美李集团的怨恨的爆发。
    李孝淳强烈谴责李承晚对南朝鲜人民进行血腥屠杀的罪行。他说，李承晚集团已调来了伪军和坦克，对汉城等地示威起义的人民进行镇压，把南朝鲜人民浸入了血泊中。现在全朝鲜的三千万人民都沸腾起来了，一定要惩办卖国贼李承晚！
    李孝淳说：“李承晚正用美国造的坦克和枪炮来屠杀我们的人民，全体朝鲜人民和全世界人民清楚地看到，美帝国主义使它的侵略军强占着南朝鲜，并武装李伪军，究竟是为了反对谁，对付谁！”
    李孝淳说，南朝鲜人民这一怒涛般的斗争将进行到最后胜利。他号召全体南朝鲜人民，为了使美军滚出南朝鲜、结束李承晚的恐怖统治而更勇敢地起来战斗。他号召南朝鲜“国军”官兵和警察掉转枪口站到人民这边来，为反对李承晚集团而战斗。他说：“最后审判卖国贼李承晚的日子来到了。”他说，只有使美帝国主义撤走，打倒李承晚政权，才是和平统一祖国的道路。
    李孝淳说：“我们向全世界人民呼吁：制止李承晚集团对进行正义斗争的南朝鲜人民所进行的残暴镇压，并积极支持和声援南朝鲜人民的正义斗争。”
    接着，在会上讲话的有青年学生、工人、农民的代表，他们对南朝鲜人民的斗争表示热烈的支持。他们一致地说，南朝鲜人民要团结起来作不屈的斗争。团结起来就是力量！
    大会结束后，二十多万群众在平壤各主要街道上进行了浩浩荡荡的示威游行。“支持南朝鲜人民的斗争”“立即释放被捕的人民”“立即制止李承晚集团对人民的镇压”等雷鸣般的口号声，响彻平壤全城。
    新华社平壤20日电　汉城消息：不顾李承晚集团的血腥残暴镇压和“特别戒严”，南朝鲜人民今天继续进行反对李承晚法西斯统治的斗争，而且这个斗争还向更多的城市蔓延。今天举行示威的有汉城、釜山、大丘、仁川、光州、全州、水原、里里、清州等九个城市，参加示威的有一万人以上。
    李承晚集团从昨晚九时起实行严密的新闻检查，今天汉城报纸都开了许多天窗，南朝鲜通讯社的报道也受到封锁，但是南朝鲜人民不屈不挠斗争的消息，还是透露了一些。据报道，在李承晚傀儡政权中心汉城，今天早晨又有二百多名市民袭击和捣毁了两个警亭。随后，又有二百多个学生举行了示威。
    昨天晚上，一百五十多名示威者占领了并且一直坚守着汉城城北区。通往这一地区的交通已经完全断绝。起义者用昨天从警察手里夺来的步枪和棍棒守卫这个地区，使得李承晚的军警无法进入。双方紧张地对峙着。
    据报道，另有两千名学生在汉城市郊定陵山上坚持战斗。世界通讯社报道，昨天晚上有大批示威群众分乘夺取来的十多辆吉普车和载重汽车退到汉城市区外坚持斗争。
    李承晚集团昨天和今天在汉城残暴屠杀的结果，共有一百二十三名示威者被打死，四百多人被打伤。今天汉城全市到处是荷枪实弹的李伪军和坦克，警戒森严。
    据合同通讯社今天上午报道，昨天，示威群众共烧毁和破坏了李承晚伪政权统治中心的十四个机关和十六幢建筑物。示威群众还烧毁或破坏了李伪集团的汽车二十二辆，并且夺得很多汽车。
    今天上午十时在全罗北道主要城市全州，有全州大学学生一百多名冲出校门举行了反对李承晚法西斯统治的示威。
    在仁川，三百多名学生今天早晨也冲出学校，举行了示威。他们高呼：“不准用刺刀来粉碎民主！”“给我们的学校以自由！”
    汉城和各地人民的英勇示威给予卖国贼李承晚沉重的打击，并使汉城的李伪统治机构处于瘫痪状态。李承晚本人已被昨天冲向他的住所的数万人民的示威吓得惊慌万状。他除从前线调回了一个携带有重武器的李伪军师团回汉城外，还派大批宪兵警察保护着他。今天又命令他的军警在他的住所——景武台门前筑起了街垒、架起了机枪，除驻有大批荷枪实弹的军警以外，还调来了坦克。
    据同和通讯社报道，汉城市李伪政权的各机关今天都惊惶不安，并陷于瘫痪状态。在19日被示威群众打了个落花流水的“中央厅”内，李伪政权的“复兴部”、“外资厅”、“海务厅”等机关的官吏们，害怕群众再来袭击，人人准备随时逃走。今天李伪政权各“中央官所”都禁止一般人出入，“职员们在不安的气氛中在办公室里议论纷纷”。
    李承晚今天在发表谈话时已完全改变了前几天高叫“严厉镇压”的那种调子，而用欺骗的手法说什么“现在不是追究原因和责任的时候”，要人民“恢复法律和秩序”。（附图片）
