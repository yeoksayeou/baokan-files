　　Seven-Day Graduation
　　Shan Jiushan
　　In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the Tianjin Huifu Pharmaceutical Factory, based on the workers' urgent need to learn culture and technology, created a "One-Week Technical School." What a fresh name! Who has ever heard of a school that enrolls students on Monday and graduates them on Sunday?
　　However, no one can underestimate it. This is indeed a new type of educational organization. Look! The "One-Week Technical School" of the Sulfonamide Workshop in this factory is divided into five departments according to the nature of the production process. Veteran workers serve as teachers, the workshop serves as the classroom, production equipment serves as teaching instruments, and the process regulations serve as the teaching syllabus. The teaching progress of the teachers is: teach on the first day, let go on the second day, see the results on the third day, walk around on the fourth day, grade homework on the fifth day, and summarize on the sixth day. The learning schedule of the students is: learn on the first day, work on the second day, practice comprehensively on the third day, have a small test on the fourth day, perform on the fifth day, and present gifts on the sixth day. In just one week, the workers have generally improved their technical theoretical level, promoted the in-depth development of the technical revolution movement. In February, the output of the entire workshop doubled compared to January, and in March, it increased by nearly one time compared to February.
　　Such a school is really good. What's so good about it? First, it's fast. Teachers teach fast, students learn fast, actual results are obtained fast, and the improvement of technical theoretical level is fast. This speed proves that with the high-speed development of the current technical revolution movement, the cultural revolution can also develop at high speed; the "poor" face can be changed quickly, and the "blank" face can also be changed quickly. Second, theory is linked to practice. It's still those workers, it's still that workshop. After you teach me and I learn from you, learning from each other's strengths and making up for weaknesses, learning in practice, and doing in learning, the workers quickly improved their technical theoretical level and enriched their scientific knowledge. Third, it directly promotes production. The teaching purpose of the "One-Week Technical School" is very clear: starting from production, serving production, and improving production. A one-week school has so many benefits, so it is worth promoting and popularizing it greatly.
　　This initiative has given us a lot of inspiration. The workers' eager desire to improve their cultural and technical level encourages people to study hard; and the workers' creative spirit of being good at linking theory with practice and solving practical problems gives people a key to learning.

    七天毕业
    单久山
    天津惠符制药厂在技术革新和技术革命运动中，根据工人学习文化技术的迫切要求，创办了一种“一周技术学校”。多么新鲜的名称！谁听说过，办学校，竟然有星期一招生，星期日就毕业的呢？
    可是，谁也不能小看它。这确是一种新型的教育组织形式。请看！这个厂磺胺车间的“一周技术学校”，按生产工艺性质分成五个系，老工人当教师、车间当课堂、生产设备当教学仪器，工艺规程当教学大纲。老师们的教学进程是：一日来传授，二日就放手，三日看成绩，四日来回走，五日批作业，六日作总结。学员们的学习日程是：一日学，二日干，三日全面练，四日小测验，五日作表演，六日把礼献。为时不过一周，工人们普遍提高了技术理论水平，推动了技术革命运动的深入发展，2月份全车间产量比1月份提高了一倍，3月份又比2月份提高近一倍。
    这样的学校，真是好得很。好在哪里？一是快。老师教得快，学生学得快，实际收效得快，技术理论水平提高得快。这种快证明，随着当前技术革命运动的高速度发展，文化革命也能高速度发展；“穷”的面貌能够迅速改变，“白”的面貌也能够迅速改变。二是理论联系实际。还是那些工人，还是那个车间，经过你教我学，取长补短，在干中学，在学中做，于是迅速提高了技术理论水平，丰富了科学知识。三是直接推动了生产。“一周技术学校”的教学目的很明确，从生产出发，为生产服务提高生产。一周的学校，具有如此多的好处，可见值得大大提倡，普遍推广。
    这个创举，使我们得到不少启发。工人群众那种如饥如渴地要求提高文化技术水平的愿望，鼓舞着人们发奋学习；而工人群众那种善于联系实际、善于解决实际问题的创造精神，使人们找到了一把学习的钥匙。
