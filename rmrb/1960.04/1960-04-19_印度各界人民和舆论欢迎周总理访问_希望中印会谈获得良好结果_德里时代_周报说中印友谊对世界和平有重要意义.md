Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 18th. People from all walks of life in India have been holding gatherings and writing letters to the Chinese Embassy in India, expressing their heartfelt welcome to Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, who is about to visit here to resolve the Sino-Indian border issue and strengthen friendship between the two countries.

The Chinese Embassy here has recently received a number of letters. Some of these letters come from Assam in the northeast, and others from the Madras coast in the far south.

An editor of an Assamese weekly, in a letter to the Chinese Premier through the Chinese Embassy, said that the Indian people "heartily welcome you to our capital." He hopes that the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India will achieve good results. He wrote: "I thank you for bringing good wishes to the Indian people and their pure land. Hindi-Chini bhai bhai (Indians and Chinese are brothers)."

A writer living in Mussoorie wrote in a letter that the Chinese Premier's visit "will definitely strengthen the friendly relations between our two countries and pave the way for a closer understanding of the amazing developments taking place in your great country."

A letter from Kutch reads: "We are very pleased to welcome you to our country after a long time, hoping that the friendship between our two countries will become stronger and stronger. We pay the greatest respect to the people of your country." Another letter from Banswara, Rajasthan, to Premier Zhou Enlai reads: "I wish you success and hope that the traditional friendship between these two great Asian countries will continue."

Members of many state committees of the India-China Friendship Association expressed their welcome to the Chinese Premier's visit. A lawyer and member of the India-China Friendship Association in Ambala wrote in a letter: "We eagerly look forward to the upcoming talks between the two Prime Ministers and warmly hope that the border dispute will be resolved amicably and peacefully."

Many people wrote letters requesting autographed photos of Premier Zhou Enlai. A newspaper editor in Patna, Bihar, wrote in a letter: "We suggest that the visit of the Chinese Premier be taken as an opportunity to strengthen peaceful and friendly relations between our country and People's China. We welcome informative features introducing the development of the People's Republic of China over the past decade, the achievements of the People’s Communes, the tradition of peace and friendship between India and China, and the peaceful foreign policy of the People's Republic of China."

People in various counties and states of India have also held mass rallies and passed resolutions welcoming the upcoming visit of the Chinese Premier. The Peace Council of Madurai, a historical city in Madras State, unanimously passed a resolution welcoming the upcoming meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India and sincerely hoping that "they will not only find a satisfactory solution to the India-China border issue but also take all effective steps to restore the sincere and friendly relations that existed between India and China when Panchsheel was proclaimed, and to further enhance and develop this relationship."

Women in Tirukoilur, Madras State, and the Peace Council of Nadia County, West Bengal, also recently held mass rallies and passed resolutions welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India, expressing the hope that the Prime Ministers of the two countries will resolve the border issue through friendly talks. The resolution of the Nadia County Peace Council also called on people to be vigilant against the attempts of certain reactionary political leaders in India to obstruct the upcoming meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 18th. On the eve of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India, Indian public opinion and the masses of people have expressed a warm welcome to Premier Zhou Enlai's visit.

The "Delhi Times" weekly published an editorial on the 17th, saying, "The people and government of our country (India) should extend the most heartfelt welcome to the distinguished Chinese leaders."

The editorial said, "We most earnestly request that friendly talks lead to a satisfactory resolution of our dispute with the Chinese government."

The editorial emphasized the importance of the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' talks reaching a complete understanding, the friendship and cooperation between China and India, and the solidarity of the Asian and African people for world peace. It said that the unity of the Asian and African people will prevent foreign colonialist exploiters from ever daring to set foot again on the sacred land of Asia and Africa. On this point, the leaders of China and India bear a great responsibility to their own people, to the people of Asian and African countries, and to all peace-loving people in the world. The editorial said that only war-mongers with aggressive tendencies hope that Sino-Indian friendship will deteriorate so that they can fish in troubled waters. The editorial warned people to be wary of the conspiracies of these forces.

The editorial strongly condemned the anti-China movement of imperialism, especially the war-mongers in the United States, and condemned certain Indians and newspapers who act as their pawns. The editorial said that the owners of these newspapers "may not like People's China and the great leaders who control the fate of China, but the people of our country can only respect and admire their leaders and the amazing achievements they have made in an unbelievably short period of time. Asia and Africa should feel proud and happy about this, because Asia and Africa cannot so quickly forget the painful national humiliation and suffering they have suffered at the hands of foreign exploiters and plunderers."

The "Free Press" published an editorial on the 17th, hoping that the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India would be a complete success. It said, "Let the harmful air dissipate, giving way to friendship, mutual love, and brotherly affection. May trust and devotion to Panchsheel bring us auspicious nectar."

The newspaper also reported that Jyoti Basu, a leader of the Communist Party of West Bengal, when speaking at a parliamentary election rally in Calcutta on April 16, called for a resolution of the Sino-Indian border issue through peaceful negotiations. He said that such negotiations and talks are the only glorious way to seek a satisfactory solution. He reminded people to be vigilant against the possibility of further new propaganda to undermine the negotiations.

The same day's "Free Press" also reported that a farmers' conference attended by more than 500 representatives in West Bengal unanimously passed a resolution on the 16th, wishing the upcoming talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India success. When the chairman of the meeting, the vice chairman of the All-India Farmers Association, and member of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, Bankim Mukherjee, proposed this motion, it was warmly welcomed by the representatives present.

The West Bengal Youth Conference, which began on April 15 and lasted for three days in Calcutta, unanimously passed a resolution expressing the hope that the upcoming talks between Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou Enlai in Delhi would be a complete success. The more than 500 representatives of youth organizations participating in this meeting represented more than 25,000 young people.

A recent issue of the Urdu weekly "People's Century" published an editorial, hoping that the talks between the two Prime Ministers in Delhi will be conducted in an atmosphere of friendship and achieve success.

The editorial praised Premier Zhou's speech at the National People's Congress, saying: This speech "makes us even more convinced that not only can the Sino-Indian dispute be satisfactorily resolved, but also that the resolution of this problem will further strengthen the friendship between the peoples of the two countries."

The editorial refuted the slanders against China spread by certain elements in India to undermine the Sino-Indian talks, these people slandering China as harboring so-called "ulterior motives." The editorial said that some elements in India believe that a peaceful negotiated solution to the Sino-Indian border issue is sounding their death knell.

The editorial of "Unity News" today expressed its unwillingness to let the Sino-Indian border issue drag on for a long time. It said that the long-term failure to resolve this problem will be detrimental to India. It said that negotiations can only succeed if both sides are friendly and eager to compromise. However, this newspaper still insists on the fallacy that China has "occupied Indian territory."

In addition, some right-wing newspapers in India, which are trying hard to undermine the Sino-Indian talks, are very worried about the success of the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' talks. The editorial published by "Indian Express" on the 18th exposed this concern. It fears that if the talks are successful, "China's prestige and strength will increase in the minds of the smaller countries in Asia." At the same time, the Indian People's League, the People's Socialist Party, and the Liberty Party gathered a small group of reactionaries on the 17th to hold rallies and demonstrations in an attempt to poison the atmosphere of the talks.

    印度各界人民和舆论欢迎周总理访问
    希望中印会谈获得良好结果
    “德里时代”周报说中印友谊对世界和平有重要意义
    新华社新德里18日电　印度各界人民纷纷举行集会，还写信给中国驻印度大使馆，表示衷心欢迎为了解决中印边界问题和加强两国之间的友谊而即将到这里访问的中国总理周恩来。
    这里的中国大使馆最近接到了一些信件。这些信件中有的来自东北部的阿萨姆，有的来自最南端的马德拉斯海滨。
    一家阿萨姆文周刊的一位编辑在通过中国大使馆写给中国总理的信中说，印度人民“衷心欢迎您到我们的首都来”。他希望中印两国总理的会谈能取得良好的结果。他写道：“我感谢您将要为印度人民及其纯洁的土地带来良好的祝愿。印地秦尼巴依巴依（印中人民是兄弟）。”
    一位住在穆索里山庄的作家在信中说，中国总理的访问“肯定将加强我们两国之间的友好关系，并为更密切地了解您的伟大的国家正在取得的惊人的发展铺平道路”。
    从喀齐来的一封信写道：“我们非常高兴地欢迎您在经过很长一段时间以后到我国来，希望我们两国之间的友谊愈来愈巩固。我们向贵国人民致最大的敬意。”另一封来自班斯瓦拉拉贾斯塔的写给周恩来总理的信写道：“我希望您成功，并希望亚洲这两个伟大国家之间的传统友谊将继续下去。”
    印中友好协会的许多邦委员会的会员表示欢迎中国总理的访问。翁巴拉市的一位律师和印中友好协会会员在一封信中写道：“我们殷切地期望着两位总理即将举行的会谈，并热烈希望边界争端将得到友好和和平的解决。”
    许多人写信索取周恩来总理亲笔签名的照片。比哈尔邦巴特那的一位报纸编辑在信中写道：“我们建议把中国总理的访问作为加强我国和人民中国之间和平和友好关系的机会。我们欢迎报道性的特写，介绍中华人民共和国十年来的发展、人民公社的成就、印中两国间和平与友谊的传统以及中华人民共和国的和平外交政策。”
    各县和各邦的印度人民还举行群众大会，并且通过决议，欢迎中国总理即将进行的访问。马德拉斯邦的历史名城马都莱市的和平理事会一致通过决议，欢迎中印两国总理即将举行的会晤并真诚地希望，“他们不仅将为印中边界问题找出令人满意的解决办法，而且还将采取一切有效步骤来恢复宣告潘查希拉时印中之间存在的那种真诚和友好关系，并使这种关系得到进一步的增进和发展”。
    马德拉斯邦土的科林的妇女和西孟加拉邦纳迪亚县和平理事会在最近也举行了群众大会并通过决议欢迎周恩来总理到印度访问，并表示希望两国总理通过友好会谈，解决边界问题。纳迪亚县和平理事会的决议还要求人们警惕印度某些反动政治领袖阻挠中印两国总理即将举行的会晤的企图。
    新华社新德里18日电　在周恩来总理访问印度前夕，印度舆论和人民群众对周恩来总理的访问表示了热烈的欢迎。
    “德里时代”周报17日发表社论说，“我国（印度）人民和政府应当向杰出的中国领导人们表示最衷心的欢迎。”
    社论说，“我们最殷切地要求友好会谈导致我们同中国政府的争端的圆满解决。”
    社论强调指出，中印总理会谈达成完全的谅解、中印友谊和合作对世界和平和亚非人民的团结的重要意义。它说，亚非人民的团结，将使外国殖民主义剥削者永远不敢再次踏上亚非的神圣的土地。在这一点上，中国和印度的领导人，对于他们本国的人民，对于亚非各国的人民，还对于全世界爱好和平的人类，都负有重大的责任。社论说，世界上只有侵略成性的战争贩子才希望中印友谊恶化，以便他们混水摸鱼。社论警告说，要提防这些势力的阴谋诡计。
    社论强烈谴责帝国主义特别是美国的战争贩子仇视中国的运动，并谴责充当他们走狗的某些印度人和报纸。社论说，这些报纸的老板“也许不喜欢人民中国和掌握中国命运的伟大领袖，但是我国人民，只能敬爱和钦佩他们的领导人和他们在难以相信的短时期内取得的惊人成就。亚非两洲应当为此感到自豪和高兴，因为亚非两洲不能这么快地忘掉外国剥削者和掠夺者使他们受到的那种惨痛的民族屈辱和苦难。”
    “自由报”17日发表社论，希望中印两国总理会谈胜利成功。它说，“让有害的空气消散，让位给友好、互爱和兄弟之情。愿信任和对潘查希拉的钟情给我们带来吉祥的甘露。”
    这家报纸还报道，西孟加拉邦共产党领袖乔蒂·巴苏4月16日在加尔各答举行的议会选举集会上讲话时，要求通过和平谈判解决中印边界问题。他说，这种谈判和会谈是求得圆满解决的唯一光荣途径。他提醒人们警惕可能进一步出现新的破坏谈判的宣传。
    同一天的“自由报”还报道，西孟加拉邦五百多名代表参加的农民会议上16日一致通过决议，祝即将举行的中印两国总理会谈成功。当会议主席、全印农民协会副主席和西孟加拉邦立法议会议员班基姆·幕克吉提出这项动议时，受到到会代表们的热烈欢迎。
    4月15日在加尔各答开始的历时三天的西孟加拉青年会议一致通过决议，希望尼赫鲁总理和周恩来总理即将在德里举行的会谈完全成功。参加这个会议的五百多名青年组织的代表代表着二万五千多名青年。
    最近一期乌尔都文周刊“人民世纪”发表社论，希望两国总理在德里的会谈将能在友谊的气氛中进行，并且取得成功。
    社论赞扬周总理在中国全国人民代表大会上的讲话，它说：这一讲话“使我们更加相信，不仅中印争端能得到满意的解决，而且这个问题的解决将能进一步加强两国人民之间的友谊。”
    社论驳斥了印度某些分子为了破坏中印会谈而散布的对中国的诽谤，这些人诽谤中国怀有所谓“不可告人的动机”。社论说，印度有些分子认为和平协商解决中印边界问题是敲他们的丧钟。
      “团结报”今天的社论表示不愿让中印边界问题长期拖下去。它说，这个问题迟迟不解决将不利于印度。它说，只要双方都是友好的、迫切希望妥协的，谈判才能成功。但是，这家报纸仍坚持所谓中国“占领了印度地方”的谬论。
    另外，印度一些极力在破坏中印会谈的右派报纸，却十分担心中印总理会谈成功。“印度快报”18日发表的社论中暴露了这种担心。它害怕如果会谈成功，“中国的威信和力量在亚洲小国的心目中将会提高”。同时，印度人民同盟、人民社会党和自由党搜罗了一小撮反动分子在17日举行了企图毒化会谈气氛的集会和示威。
