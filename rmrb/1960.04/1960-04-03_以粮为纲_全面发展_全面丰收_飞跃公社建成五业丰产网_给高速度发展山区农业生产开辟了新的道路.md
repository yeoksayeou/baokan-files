According to the Shanxi Daily, the Feiyue People's Commune in Lüliang County, Shanxi Province, is vigorously developing the benefits of mountains, water, grass, and trees, and has built a 10,000-mu "Five-Industry High-Yield Network" of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, finding a new path for the high-speed development of mountainous agricultural production and the implementation of the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified management. The Lüliang County Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting of the Party Committee Secretaries of all communes in March to promote this experience comprehensively.

The Feiyue People's Commune is an area where mountains, terraces, slopes, and rivers are connected, and ridges and gullies are numerous. The struggle to conquer mountains and harness water over the past few years has played a significant role in changing the impoverished landscape. To further fully utilize natural resources and comprehensively develop the mountainous economy, the Party Committee of the Feiyue People's Commune launched a debate among all commune members to learn from other places, summarize their own experiences, study policies, and find directions. By watching (visiting other places), comparing (comparing regional conditions), learning (studying the Party's policies), and thinking (brainstorming ideas), everyone expressed their opinions, pooled their wisdom, and unified their understanding, combining the soil and water conservation movement of managing mountains, water, and soil, the great revolution in farmland cultivation, and the "Twelve Rearing" movement of animal husbandry, closely linking them together. They found a path of comprehensive planning, complete management, comprehensive development, and full utilization of mountains, terraces, slopes, and rivers, encompassing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery – a full-scale great revolution.

Immediately following this, a battle of full-scale great revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery began. The First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee personally took command, organizing 1,700 commune members in the manner of large corps, large-scale collaboration, and large-scale assault. In twenty days, they transformed an area of 10,000 mu with rivers, slopes, gullies, terraces, and mountains in the Wulihou Management District into a "Five-Industry High-Yield Network" that fully utilized mountains, water, grass, and trees, and comprehensively developed agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery.

First, they took large-scale high-yield grain production as the leader and built a 4,500-mu grain high-yield base. All 310 pieces of land, with excessive field edges, winding roads, and chaotic planting, left over from the small-scale peasant economy, were completely revolutionized. Through leveling protrusions and filling gullies, straightening bends, rationally planning field roads, slicing and dividing into squares, four high-yield squares and eight planting areas were formed. A mountain-encircling canal for both clear water and flood control, eight *li* long, was built along the foot of the mountain, allowing the clear water of the Xinshui River to flow through four cascades, two culverts, and twenty gates into sixteen field branch canals, irrigating the farmland, and transforming 2,000 mu of dry land, with low yields for generations, into high-standard garden fields that guarantee harvest even without rain. This year's planned grain yields: 100 mu with a yield of 2,000 *jin* per mu, 100 mu with 1,500 *jin*, 300 mu with 1,000 *jin*, 500 mu with 800 *jin*, 1,000 mu with 500 *jin*, and 2,000 mu with 400 *jin*.

On shallow gullies, gentle slopes, and low mounds, terrace fields were built to create a 1,000-mu orchard base, planting 15,000 fruit and nut trees. In barren mountains, barren slopes, and tributary ditches, soil and water conservation projects such as constructing check dams and digging fish-scale pits along contour lines were implemented to establish a 2,500-mu forestry base, planting 49,880 various timber trees. Combined with the orchard and forestry bases, a 4,000-mu feed base was established.

In the nine gullies with a total length of 45 *li*, defenses were built according to the harm they caused, constructing 206 dams. Along the gully cliffs, simple and crude cave dwellings were built according to the terrain, with one, two, three, and four layers, totaling 507 cave dwellings, establishing pig farms with 1,000 heads, sheep farms with 1,000 sheep, chicken farms with 1,000 chickens, rabbit farms with 1,000 rabbits, bee farms with 100 hives, silkworm farms with 100 frames, and a comprehensive livestock farm with 100 cattle, donkeys, and mules. Using the natural terrain, nine small reservoirs were built at the gully mouths and in low-lying areas, including fish ponds with 10,000 fish, duck ponds with 100 ducks, drinking ponds, bathing ponds, and fertilizer storage for pigs, sheep, cattle, and rabbits.

Through this series of management and construction, from terrace to river, from slope to gully, complete construction, complete production, and complete utilization, the Five-Industry High-Yield Network was transformed into a prosperous picture of comprehensive development.

The Five-Industry High-Yield Network, following the production policy of "taking grain as the key link, promoting the prosperity of the five industries, comprehensive management, and comprehensive development," is managed uniformly and divided by industry. A Party and Communist Youth League branch has been established within the network, consisting of a management committee of nine people, with five sections: agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. A professional team of 330 people (210 in agriculture, 20 in forestry, 70 in animal husbandry, 25 in sideline occupations, and 5 in fishery) has been drawn to manage and operate the network. In production, collaboration will be organized at any time according to production needs, supporting each other and jointly ensuring the completion of production tasks in all industries.

From the current situation, this Five-Industry High-Yield Network has ten major benefits: (1) It is more conducive to fully exploiting the superiority of the People's Commune's large scale and high degree of public ownership, greatly promoting the consolidation and development of the People's Commune, and creating more wealth for society; (2) Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery are closely integrated, mutually supportive, and advancing in an all-round way; (3) The production process is rational, which can save a lot of labor; (4) There are many avenues and a wide variety of products, the area is concentrated, and operation is convenient; (5) Long-term interests and immediate interests are closely combined; (6) Engineering measures and biological measures for managing mountains, water, and soil are closely combined, and biological measures and grazing measures are closely combined; (7) It can fully exploit the potential of the land and improve the land utilization rate; (8) It is convenient to organize socialist labor competitions, carry out cooperation with each other, and disseminate and promote advanced experiences in a timely manner; (9) It is convenient to conduct scientific research, which is greatly beneficial to the agricultural technology revolution; (10) It can cultivate a new type of worker who is proficient in one and versatile in many, with multiple skills.

The Lüliang County Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an on-site meeting of the First Secretaries of the Party Committees of all communes at the Feiyue Commune, comprehensively promoting the experience of the Feiyue Commune, thereby pushing the county's preparatory agricultural production movement, with water and fertilizer as the leader and drought resistance as the center, to a greater climax.

    以粮为纲　全面发展　全面丰收
    飞跃公社建成五业丰产网
    给高速度发展山区农业生产开辟了新的道路
    据山西日报消息　山西省吕梁县飞跃人民公社大兴山水草木之利，建起万亩面积的农林牧副渔“五业丰产网”，为高速度发展山区农业生产和贯彻以粮为纲全面发展多种经营方针找到了一条新路。中共吕梁县委已于3月间举行全县各公社党委书记现场会议全面推广。
    飞跃人民公社是个山垣坡川相连、梁峁沟壑成群的地区。几年来征山服水的斗争，对改变贫瘠面貌起了很大作用。为了进一步充分利用自然资源，全面发展山区经济，中共飞跃公社党委发动全体社员进行了一次学习外地、总结自己、研究方针、寻找方向的辩论会。通过看（外地参观）、比（比地区条件）、学（学习党的方针）、想（想办法），人人发表议论，集思广益，统一了认识，把治山治水治土的水土保持运动、农田耕作大革命运动、畜牧业的十二养运动，合而为一，紧密地结合在一起，找到了一条山垣沟坡川，农林牧副渔，全面规划，成套治理，综合开发，全面利用的全线大革命的道路。
    紧接着，一场农林牧副渔全线大革命的战斗开始了。公社党委第一书记亲自挂帅，以大兵团大协作大突击的办法，组织了一千七百名社员，在五里后管理区以二十天时间，将一个有川有坡有沟有垣有山的万亩面积，建设成一座山水草木全利用、农林牧副渔齐发展的五业丰产网。
    首先，他们以粮食大面积高额生产为帅，建设了四千五百亩粮食丰产基地。把原来在小农经济耕作制度时期残留下来的塄畔过多、道路弯曲、种植杂乱的三百一十块土地，统统用彻底革命的办法，经过平凸填沟，取弯就直，合理规划田间道路，切片划方，修成了四个丰产方，八个种植区域。沿山脚修筑了一条长达八华里的清洪两用转山渠道，使昕水河的清水通过四个跌水、两个涵洞、二十个闸门流入十六条田间支渠，灌溉农田，使两千亩千年万代祖祖辈辈低产的旱地，变成了无雨保丰收的高标准园田。粮食产量今年计划：亩产双千斤的一百亩，一千五百斤的一百亩，千斤的三百亩，八百斤的五百亩，五百斤的一千亩，四百斤的两千亩。
    在浅沟、缓坡、低峁土地上，通过修台田，建成千亩花果基地，栽植了水果、干果树一万五千株。在荒山、荒坡、支毛沟渠、通过打谷坊、挖鳞坑，作等高线等水保工程，建立了两千五百亩的林业基地，已栽植了各种木材树四万九千八百八十株。结合花果、林业基地，建立了四千亩饲料基地。
    在全长四十五华里的九条沟内，因害设防，打坝二百零六条，沿沟崖因陋就简，按地形修建了一层、二层、三层、四层的窑洞五百零七孔，建起了千头猪场、千只羊场、千只鸡场、千只兔场、百箱蜂场、百席蚕场和百头牛驴骡马综合牧场。利用自然地形在沟口和低凹地方修了九个小水库，有万尾鱼池，百只鸭塘，猪、羊、牛、兔饮水池、洗澡塘、肥料库等。
    通过这一系列的治理建设，从垣到川，从坡到沟，建设成套，生产成套，利用成套，把五业丰产网变成了全面发展的富贵图。
    五业丰产网按照“以粮为纲，五业俱兴，综合经营，全面发展”的生产方针，统一经营，分业管理。网内建立了党团支部，由九人组成管委会，下设农业、林业、畜牧业、副业、渔业五个股。抽调了三百三十人的专业队（农业二百一十人、林业二十人、畜牧业七十人、副业二十五人，渔业五人）经营管理。在生产中将根据生产需要随时组织协作，互相支援，共同保证完成各业生产任务。
    从目前情况来看，这种五业丰产网有十大好处：（1）更便于充分发挥人民公社一大二公的优越性，大大促进人民公社的巩固与发展，为社会创造更多财富；（2）农林牧副渔紧密结合，相依互助，全面跃进；（3）生产过程合理，可以大量节省劳力；（4）门路多，品种繁，地区集中，便利经营；（5）长远利益和眼前利益结合紧密；（6）治山治水治土的工程措施和生物措施紧密结合，生物措施和牧养措施紧密结合；（7）可以充分发挥土地潜力，提高土地利用率；（8）便于组织社会主义劳动竞赛，互相开展协作，及时传播推广先进经验；（9）便于进行科学研究，大大有利于农业技术革命；（10）可以培养精一兼数，一人多艺的新型劳动者。
    中共吕梁县委在飞跃公社召开了各公社党委第一书记的现场会议，全面推广了飞跃公社经验，从而把全县以水肥为帅抗旱为中心的备耕运动推向到一个更大的高潮。
