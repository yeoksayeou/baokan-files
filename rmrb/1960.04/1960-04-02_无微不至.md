    Meticulous Care
    Mei Yuan
        The all-purpose service station handles everything,
        Offering repairs, washing, mending, and dyeing, from food to clothing.
        Bachelors have you, washing and mending is no longer a worry,
        Women have you, life is free from concerns,
        Workers have you, their work enthusiasm is added,
        Everywhere there is you, happiness is boundless.
    This is a hymn from the masses to the urban street service organizations. Street canteens, nurseries, and service stations are now blossoming everywhere in many cities like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. They have organized the scattered housework, thoroughly liberating the broad masses of women. For thousands of years, people influenced by the selfish hearts of the exploiting classes, those who “sweep only the snow from their own doorsteps,” are now experiencing a new fashion of mutual care and cooperation. Consumption-oriented streets are being transformed into production-oriented streets. Neighbors who used to not interact with each other have become as close as family, as dear as flesh and blood. Our city is radiant, full of vitality, and speeding forward on the road of socialist construction!

    There are many outstanding service stations whose service range is so wide that it can be said they cover clothing, food, housing, transportation, birth, old age, sickness, and death, from morning to night, all year round, taking care of almost all housework. I once saw a service station staff member go to the homes of some employees who had entrusted them, every day at 4:30 in the afternoon, to start the stove, so that the couple, who both work, could be warm as soon as they returned home. The masses said, "The horizontal plaque above the Bodhisattva statue, 'Answers every prayer,' should now be hung at the entrance of the service station." But today's street service organizations do more than just "answer every prayer." They also proactively do many, many things for the residents. They are responsible for picking up and dropping off children to kindergarten; if someone is sick, they are responsible for taking care of them and decocting medicine; in the street canteen, if someone can't eat, the waiter immediately comes over and asks, "Is the food not tasty? Are you sick? Let me make you a bowl of noodles."... The masses said: "You are the good stewards sent by the Party. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao really care about us. How can we not be more motivated and do a better job in production?"

    Our ancestors always fantasized about a society where people "not only love their own parents and children," where people "go in and out as friends, watch and help each other, and support each other in sickness." However, in a private-ownership society full of exploitation and oppression, their dreams could only remain dreams. Such a society can only be rapidly realized in our current social system in a short ten years. Under the leadership and education of the Party, the broad masses have established collectivist thought, and a large number of women have stepped out of the narrow confines of the family; all this has broadened people's minds, raised their awareness, and given them lofty life goals and ideals, no longer indulging in the low-level tastes of individualism. Today, among us, people are closely related, sharing the same breath, and establishing a blood-like connection, not only having already realized the dreams of the ancients, but also reaching a more magnificent and perfect realm that the ancients could not imagine.

    Our Party and Chairman Mao have always attached great importance to the people's clothing, food, housing, firewood, rice, oil, salt, disease and health, marriage, and all practical life issues of the masses. The more the Party cares about the lives of the masses, the greater the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses will be. The Party's care for the lives of the masses is like a mother's care for her children, it is meticulous. The Party is the great organizer of the lives of the masses. The meticulous care of urban street service organizations for the lives of the masses is precisely the concrete embodiment of the Party's care for the lives of the masses. Meticulous care is precisely the description of the relationship between people today, and it is precisely the fashion of our great era.

    无微不至
    梅原
        万能服务站，样样都能办，
        做修洗补染，从吃直到穿。
        独身汉有你，洗补不犯难，
        妇女有了你，生活无挂牵，
        职工有了你，工作干劲添，
        到处都有你，幸福乐无边。
    这是群众对城市街道服务组织的赞歌。街道食堂、托儿所、服务站，现在正像雨后春笋一样，在许多城市遍地开花。它们把分散的家务劳动组织了起来，使广大家庭妇女获得了彻底的解放。几千年来，一直受剥削阶级自私自利之心的影响，“各扫门前雪”的人们，正兴起一种互相关怀、互相协作的新风尚。消费的街道，一变而为生产的街道。互不来往的邻里，变得亲如一家，情同骨肉。我们的城市，容光焕发，生气勃勃，在社会主义建设的大道上飞奔向前！
    有许多出色的服务站，服务范围之广，真可以说是衣食住行、生老病死、从早到晚、一年四季，几乎什么家务劳动都包下来了。我曾看到一位服务站的工作人员，每天下午四时半，就到一些委托他们的职工家去生炉子，好让都参加工作的夫妻俩一回到家，就能取暖。群众说：“过去挂在菩萨像上面的横匾‘有求必应’，现在应该挂到服务所门口去。”但，今天的街道服务组织，又岂止是“有求必应”呢？他们还主动为居民做了很多很多事情。孩子上幼儿园，它们负责接送；有人生了病，他们负责照顾、煎药；在街道食堂里，有人吃饭时吃不下，服务员便立刻走过来问：“是饭菜味道不好吗？是不是有病？给您下碗挂面吃吧。”……群众说：“你们是党派来的好当家人，共产党、毛主席真关心我们，我们怎能不更加鼓足干劲、把生产搞得更好呢？”
    我们的祖先们，总是幻想着有一个“使人不独亲其亲、不独子其子”、“出入相友，守望相助，疾病相扶持”的社会。但是，在充满剥削、压迫的私有制社会里，他们也只能是梦想而已。这样的社会，只有在我们今天的社会制度下，才能在短短的十年里迅速地实现。广大群众在党的领导和教育下，树立了集体主义思想，大批家庭妇女走出了家庭的狭小天地；这一切，都使人们心胸开阔、觉悟提高，有了崇高的生活目的和理想，不再沉缅于个人主义的低级趣味中了。今天在我们这里，人们休戚相关，呼吸与共，建立了血肉般的联系，不仅早已实现了古人的梦想，而且达到了古人无法想像的更壮丽、更完美的境界。
    我们的党和毛主席，从来就十分重视群众的穿衣问题、吃饭问题、住房问题、柴米油盐问题、疾病卫生问题、婚姻问题和一切群众的实际生活问题的。党越是关心群众生活，群众的革命干劲就会越大。我们的党，对群众生活的关怀，就像母亲对子女那样，是无微不至的。党，是群众生活的伟大组织者。城市街道服务组织对群众生活的无微不至的关怀，正是党对群众生活关怀的具体体现。无微不至，正是我们今天人与人之间关系的描述，正是我们这个伟大时代的风尚。
