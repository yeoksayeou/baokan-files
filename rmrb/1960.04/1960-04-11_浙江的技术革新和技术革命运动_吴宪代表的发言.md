    Zhejiang's Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Movement
    Speech by Delegate Wu Xian
    I fully support the reports on the national economic plan and the final financial accounts presented by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. Now, I would like to report to the congress on the situation of Zhejiang Province's technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and I welcome any corrections from the delegates.
    Currently, a new high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution movement, centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, has formed across Zhejiang Province. On the industrial production, transportation, and capital construction fronts, in January and February of this year, the broad masses of workers put forward more than 310,000 innovation proposals, of which more than 170,000 have been implemented, equivalent to the total of last year. The daily output value of industrial production and the daily transportation volume in the first quarter increased by 25.8% and 10.6% respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 1959, the year of the Great Leap Forward, and the workload completed in capital construction increased by 31% compared with the same period last year.
    The arrival of this high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution is by no means accidental. This is carried out by our people under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, on the basis of the victory of two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, and is the result of the ever-deepening understanding of the General Line and the high-speed thinking after the anti-Rightist struggle and the socialist education movement. This is the result of the rapid improvement of science and technology and the great enhancement of the material foundation over the past ten years, and the result of the increasing richness of leadership experience in production and construction, especially the large-scale mass movement launched widely under centralized leadership recently. Compared with previous years, the movement has the following significant characteristics.
    First, the movement has broad mass participation. From modern factories to handicrafts, from production departments to auxiliary departments, from leading cadres, workers, technicians, and office staff to service personnel, from veteran workers to new apprentices, from employees' families to retired workers, from enterprises, schools to scientific research institutions, all are involved in this great revolutionary movement. The scale and momentum of the mass movement are even greater than the national steel-making movement in 1958.
    Second, single innovations have developed into complete and systematic innovations across entire industries, and the overall technical transformation of the industrial front is rapidly advancing. The level of mechanization and semi-mechanization in industries above the county level in the province has increased from about 40% at the end of last year to 63%. The number of automated and semi-automatic machine tools has reached 76.5%, and 1,653 automatic and linked production lines have been established. In February this year, the production capacity of 324 factories doubled compared to December last year. The earth and stone works in the capital construction front, which occupy a large amount of labor force, have basically realized mechanized and semi-mechanized operations.
    Third, the reform of equipment and tools has promoted the movement of increasing production and practicing economy and overall innovation in all aspects of the industrial front. In order to save coal, by March 15, more than 29,700 gasifiers have been built in the province, widely used in kilns, boilers, heating furnaces, as well as brewing and cooking, which can save 30% to 60% of the coal consumption in these areas. Vigorously engaged in comprehensive utilization, the grain processing and oil pressing industries alone have used rice husks, oil dregs, and cottonseed hulls to produce more than 60 products such as activated carbon, casein, stearic acid, gasoline, and furfural. In terms of increasing power, 5,600 hydropower stations with a total capacity of 42,000 horsepower and 900 small hydropower stations with a total capacity of over 12,000 kilowatts have been built in the province. The achievements of innovation have been increasingly reflected in the blueprints of socialist construction, and new technologies, new materials, new structures, and new processes are beginning to be widely used in both architectural design and product design. In addition, the province has successfully trial-produced a batch of advanced, sophisticated, and cutting-edge products.
    Fourth, the technical revolution has further promoted a new upsurge of cultural revolution. Industrial enterprises throughout the province are running spare-time political, cultural, and technical schools on a large scale, and universally establishing "three-way combination" scientific research groups. After work, the masses of workers actively study politics, culture, and engage in technical research, thereby promoting the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to develop more deeply and persistently.
    The technical innovation and technical revolution movement has entered a new stage, experiencing the process of creating public opinion, exposing contradictions, breaking through key points, and launching a comprehensive effort. Starting in October last year, we created public opinion for the technical revolution through a series of activities such as the Advanced Producers' Congress. In particular, the Third Provincial Party Congress in December last year widely exchanged experiences in vigorously carrying out technical innovation, clarified the goals, requirements, and methods of technical innovation, and further mobilized the enthusiasm of the entire party and the entire people to vigorously carry out technical innovation. With the continuous Great Leap Forward in production, it is necessary to further solve the contradictions of insufficient labor force, equipment capacity, raw materials, and fuel. Therefore, on the one hand, we actively promoted advanced experience, and on the other hand, we put forward the slogan of "increasing production without increasing manpower," seeking a way out to increase production from the aspect of technical innovation. At that time, the contradictions of insufficient labor force and equipment capacity were most prominent in the iron, wood, and bamboo industries with a large proportion of manual operations, as well as in rural water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, and earth and stone works for capital construction. The movement first started from these key points, and quickly formed a new high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution movement in all walks of life.
    The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is both a production revolution movement and an ideological revolution movement. Therefore, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to high speed, and deeply carry out the movement of studying Mao Zedong Thought to ensure that ideological revolution leads. After the anti-Rightist struggle and the socialist education movement, the General Line and the high-speed thinking have increasingly penetrated the hearts of the people. The broad masses of workers have further clarified that vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution is the main way to achieve a sustained Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. Under the guidance of the Party's General Line, they have rapidly launched an innovation upsurge with the ambition to "transform the world" and "march towards nature." However, some people have right-leaning conservative thoughts on the issues of whether to innovate and who to rely on to innovate. They believe that "innovation contradicts production," and "innovation cannot be carried out due to lack of equipment, materials, and technology"; some have complacency when innovation achieves slight success. These ideas are obviously very wrong. The contradiction between advanced and backward ideas in technical innovation essentially reflects the struggle between two roads: developing productive forces at high speed for the realization of communism, or sticking to old ways and stagnating. If right-leaning conservative thoughts are not severely criticized, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement cannot be launched vigorously. To this end, we have adopted a combination of positive education and setting up opposite examples to present facts, reason things out, and carry out discussions; a combination of holding on-site meetings and multi-level cadre meetings; a combination of establishing pacesetters in the factory and locally and learning from other factories and other places through study visits; a combination of creating momentum through newspapers, radio, and exhibitions and organizing Party members, League members, and activists to closely connect with the masses, and carried out political and ideological work in a thorough and meticulous manner. The movement to study Mao Zedong Thought is a great driving force for opposing the right, liberating the mind, and promoting the continuous development of the technical revolution. One-third of the workers in the Hangzhou industrial system, about 40,000 people, participated in the study of Chairman Mao's works. During the large-scale automation and semi-automation efforts in the Hangzhou Tool Factory, some workers had superstitious thoughts and fear of difficulties. The Party Branch organized all employees to study Chairman Mao's works such as "On Contradiction," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Serve the People." When the entire factory realized semi-automation, a few people commented, saying "the automatic line was built too early." The Party Branch promptly organized employees to study articles such as "How Should Marxists Treat New Things." Under the illumination of Chairman Mao's thought, the factory's employees continuously improved their understanding, further strengthened the idea of continuous revolution, and clarified the view that "new things must be victorious" and "the growth of new things must go through serious struggles." They said: "Chairman Mao's works are like the sun, illuminating our hearts, conquering difficulties like the Foolish Old Man, and being pioneers in innovation." In just a short period of time, all machine tools have achieved semi-automation, and mechanized and semi-mechanized operations in the entire factory have increased from 40% in December last year to 80%. The daily output value in February increased by 16% compared to December, truly achieving ideological leadership and closely combining ideological revolution, technical revolution, and production revolution to promote each other.
    Waging mass movements on a large scale, extensively carrying out the "three-way combination" (workers, technicians, cadres), and promoting the spirit of communist cooperation are important guarantees for the rapid and comprehensive launch of the movement. Chairman Mao said: "In addition to the leadership of the Party, 600 million people are a decisive factor. With more people, there are more discussions, higher enthusiasm, and greater drive." The broad masses of workers directly participate in production, are most familiar with the production process, and have the most urgent demands for improving equipment and improving technology. As long as we let go of the masses, endless power will be unleashed. Zhao Zuqi, an elderly worker in his sixties at the Hangzhou Lianming Bamboo Ware Factory, drew his own drawings, found his own materials, and worked hard for three days to create a bamboo-cutting machine. Zhou Youcai, a deaf-mute worker at the Jiaxing Wood Factory, created a nailing machine, which increased efficiency three times compared to manual operation. After freeing themselves from manual operations, the broad masses of workers cheered "the second liberation." Kang Heshang, an old worker at the Jiaxing Wood Factory, had long been engaged in manual labor, with a hunchback and joint pain. After realizing mechanical operation, he gratefully said: "If the Communist Party had come ten years earlier, I wouldn't have had this problem." In the large-scale mass movement, we mainly rely on veteran workers, activists among young workers, and leftists among technicians, and combine the "three-way combination" innovation teams with the labor competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, helping the backward, and engaging in large-scale cooperation, creating a situation where everyone participates, innovates everywhere, catches up with each other, and learns from and helps each other. Leading cadres going to the front line and fighting alongside the broad masses is a great encouragement to the enthusiasm of the masses. The workers said: "If the cadres have the determination, we have the confidence. With the cadres and the masses working together, we will work harder and harder." The "three-way combination" within the factory has developed into the "three-way combination" of enterprises, schools, and scientific research institutions, which is a major development of the mass movement. In the movement, units such as Zhejiang University, Hangzhou University, the Provincial Chemical Research Institute, and the Textile Industry Research Institute adopted methods of "linking up" for collaboration and assigning responsibility for specific areas, organizing teachers and students to go deep into industrial and mining enterprises to solve many technical problems related to mechanization and automation. More than 70 teachers and more than 400 fourth- and fifth-year students from the Department of Chemical Engineering of Zhejiang University put forward more than 100 technical innovation projects and wrote many scientific and technical papers through production practice. They expressed that they would work harder to transform their thinking and train themselves into red and expert intellectuals of the working class. Comprehensive technical innovation has greatly promoted the spirit of communist cooperation between enterprises, industries, and regions. The noble style of "keeping the difficulties for ourselves and giving the convenience to others" has appeared everywhere. Many units not only brought advanced experience, but also brought materials and equipment to support others. An important reason why the porters at the Desheng Ba Wharf in Hangzhou realized mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading in seven days was that they received assistance from 27 units such as the Transportation Machinery Repair and Assembly Factory. Now, this kind of large-scale cooperation has developed from mutual exchange of materials and equipment to mutual assistance in production technology; from temporary cooperation on a specific task to comprehensive and long-term cooperation. This kind of communist large-scale cooperation has enabled the mass movement, under the leadership of the Party, to move from being relatively decentralized to being more concentrated, forming a movement of the entire society centered on the working class, which has not only generated tremendous material forces, but is also profoundly changing the spiritual outlook of the broad masses.
    Resolutely implement a complete set of policies of "walking on two legs." The policy of "walking on two legs" is a concrete manifestation of the great strategic thought of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in the cause of socialist construction. Resolutely implementing this policy can comprehensively and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broadest masses, promote their infinite wisdom and creative talents, and concentrate them on the cause of socialist construction, thereby constantly creating "miracles." Xianju County is a remote mountainous county in Zhejiang Province. The construction company of this county has only more than 100 workers. They carried forward the spirit of "poor sticks making revolution" and created more than 20 kinds of new machines and tools in two months using indigenous methods. They couldn't find steel plates to make circular saws, so they used the bottom of an old gasoline drum to replace them; they lacked planer knives for trial-producing woodworking planers, so the workers bought them themselves with the spare money they earned from engaging in sideline occupations; other people's tampers were driven by motors, but they used all wood and had one person push them. Now they have transformed from relying entirely on manual operations to 60% mechanized and semi-mechanized operations, and labor productivity has increased by 45%. "Poor methods have endless solutions," and the facts in Xianju County fully prove this point. The policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods is not only fully applicable to small and medium-sized enterprises, but also fully applicable to modern factories. For example, the Hangzhou Power Plant, where the main production process was originally highly mechanized, but manual labor in areas such as in-plant transportation and machine repair shops accounted for about 40% of the plant's labor force. Relying on the masses and vigorously engaging in innovation, they realized the mechanization, semi-mechanization, and continuous operation of coal transportation, crushing, coal addition, and casting and forging. The proportion of manual operations has rapidly dropped to 17%. They improved the ventilation part of the generator using indigenous methods, increasing the output by 33%; they burned boilers with a mixture of gas and coal, increasing the output by 15%. They also successfully manufactured indigenous steam turbines, opening up new avenues for people-run electricity; at the same time, they are actively studying new technologies for automation in areas such as power allocation and accident forecasting. This shows how important it is to implement a complete set of policies such as combining foreign and indigenous methods, and combining large, medium, and small, in the great mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution.
    The content of technical innovation in industrial production and construction is extremely broad. It is necessary to make overall plans, focus on key points, unify leadership, and fight on separate lines. It is necessary to grasp the center and the key points of each period, but also to drive the overall situation, combining the solution of key production problems with the overall transformation of enterprises. What are the key points we should focus on? From the specific situation of our province, in terms of realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization, the focus is on industries and types of work that use the most labor and have the largest proportion of manual operations, such as iron, wood, and bamboo industries, earth and stone works, and loading and unloading. In terms of production, the focus is on raw materials and power sources such as coal and steel. Since December last year, most regions and enterprises in the province have, based on their specific circumstances, taken a long-term perspective and started from the near term, exposed the contradictions in realizing a sustained Great Leap Forward this year, found the key points that urgently need to be resolved in production, identified key points, and formulated plans for technical innovation and technical revolution, so that the movement can be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, both vigorously and solidly. In the movement, leaders at all levels also divided into several fronts, designated special personnel to be responsible, established offices, and made battle plans according to industries, one battle after another. The benefit of doing this is that the forces are concentrated, the main direction of attack is clear, the momentum is great, it is easy to break through key points, so that the movement can quickly achieve significant results, and encourage the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. The Zhejiang Flax Textile Factory summarized the systematic technical transformation projects into a "large dragon," and summarized the innovation projects to solve the current key production problems into eight "small dragons." From the factory and workshop to the team, there are clear goals and small-stage plans. In more than two months, the entire factory has implemented more than 1,200 innovation projects, making the output of sacks exceed the first-quarter plan 13 days ahead of schedule.
    Vigorously grasp the consolidation, promotion, and improvement work, vigorously support new things, and create conditions in all aspects, so that innovation deeds can blossom and bear fruit everywhere. Most of the innovation achievements we have already realized are scientific, but in general, the innovative equipment and machines should be further evaluated through production, and the workers' operational skills should be actively improved, so that the innovation machines gradually become perfect, and the new technologies are mastered by more people. After the Desheng Ba Wharf in Hangzhou realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, at the beginning, the workers did not know how to use the machines. In addition, the wooden loading and unloading equipment was not strong enough and was deformed by rain and sun, so the seven "dragons" of the entire wharf stopped operating at one point. After further improvement and upgrading, widely carrying out large-scale operational training, and actively improving management work, more than 80% of the workers quickly learned how to use the machines, and the "dead dragons" quickly became "living dragons" again. The average daily output after March 20 increased by more than 70% compared to the previous five days. In order to make the innovation results quickly blossom and bear fruit, it is necessary to vigorously promote effective advanced experiences within a limited time, and for advanced experiences that are not yet perfect, it is necessary to arrange for relevant units to conduct key experiments through on-site meetings, cultivate technical forces, create experience on a larger scale, learn from each other's strengths, make up for each other's weaknesses, comprehensively promote, and continuously improve. With the comprehensive launch of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, aspects such as labor organization, production management, wage quotas, and rules and regulations have appeared to be incompatible. This is a problem that deserves great attention. It tells us that while carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, we must reform certain aspects of the relations of production and the superstructure. Only in this way can the technical innovation and technical revolution movement occupy a position, consolidate a position, improve on the basis of popularization, consolidate in development, and then further promote the development and popularization of the movement, so that the movement moves forward in wave after wave.
    The development process of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is a process of recognizing the situation, liberating the mind, pointing out the direction, and continuously revolutionizing. The current task is for us to seize the advanced, vigorously strengthen political and ideological work, create momentum, and carry out mass movements of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping. At the same time, we must do a better job of making overall plans and put forward the direction of progress. Although the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Zhejiang Province has achieved certain results in the previous stage, it is still far from enough compared with the advanced regions in the country. We are determined to continuously revolutionize, continuously leap forward, accelerate the realization of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, and double the labor productivity to ensure the sustained Great Leap Forward in production and construction. While vigorously engaging in mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, we will vigorously carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, vigorously increase the production of raw materials, materials, and fuels, vigorously engage in the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, and encourage the entire people to run coal, steel, electricity, and indigenous railways. Actively promote technical innovation in engineering design and product design, widely adopt new technologies, new structures, new processes, and new materials, increase new products, and carry out the revolution in design methods. Run spare-time political, cultural, and technical schools for employees on a large scale, and cultivate a group of engineering and technical personnel who are both red and expert from among the workers in a planned way; strengthen scientific research work, so that technical innovation and scientific research are closely combined, and gradually climb the peaks of modern science and technology.
    We believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, establishing communist ambitions, building socialism with communist thought, guiding the movement with the thought of continuous revolution, relying on the broad masses, and constantly learning advanced experience and advanced technology from various places, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement will surely achieve more and greater results, and socialist construction will surely continue to leap forward at high speed.

    浙江的技术革新和技术革命运动
    吴宪代表的发言
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念副总理所作的国民经济计划和财政预决算的报告。现就浙江省开展技术革新和技术革命运动情况向大会作一发言，请代表们指正。
    当前，以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，已经在浙江全省形成全面性和全民性的新高潮。在工业生产、交通运输、基本建设战线上，今年1、2月份，广大职工提出的革新建议达三十一万多条，已经实现的有十七万多条，相当于去年的总和。第一季度工业生产日产值和交通运输日运量，比特大跃进的1959年第四季度，分别增长25.8％和10.6％，基本建设完成的工作量比去年同期增长31％。
    这次技术革新、技术革命高潮的到来，决不是偶然的。这是我国人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在两年连续大跃进的胜利基础上开展的，是反右整风和社会主义教育运动以后，总路线和高速度思想愈益深入人心的结果，是十年来科学技术水平迅速提高、物质基础大大增强的结果，是生产建设的领导经验日益丰富的结果，特别是最近时期来在集中领导下，广泛发动群众，大搞群众运动的结果。同往年比较，运动有以下几个显著的特点。
    首先，运动具有广泛的群众性。从现代化工厂到手工业，从生产部门到辅助部门，从领导干部、工人、技术人员课室人员到服务人员，从老师傅到新艺徒，从职工家属到退休工人，从企业、学校到科学研究机关，都卷入了这个伟大的革命运动，群众运动的规模和声势，同1958年全民大炼钢铁运动相比较，有过之而无不及。
    其次，单项的革新发展到全行业成套成龙的革新，工业战线全面的技术改造正在迅速向前推进。全省县以上工业的机械化半机械化水平，已由去年年底的40％左右提高到63％，实现自动化、半自动的机床已达到76.5％，建立生产自动线和联动线一千六百五十三条，今年2月份有三百二十四个工厂的生产能力比去年12月翻了一番。基本建设战线占用大量劳动力的土石方工程，已经基本实现机械化、半机械化操作。
    第三，设备工具的改革，促进了工业战线各个方面的增产节约运动和全面革新。为了节约煤炭，到3月15日止，全省建成煤气炉二万九千七百余座，广泛使用于烧窑、烧锅炉、加热炉以及酿酒、炊事等方面，可以节约这些方面煤炭用量的30％至60％。大搞综合利用，仅粮食加工和榨油业，利用谷壳、油脚和棉籽壳，就生产了活性炭、干酪素、硬脂酸、汽油、糠醛等六十多种产品。增加动力方面，全省建成水力站五千六百个，共四万二千马力；小型水电站九百个，共一万二千余瓩。革新成果已经日益增多地反映到社会主义建设的蓝图上来，无论建筑设计和产品设计，都开始广泛采用新技术、新材料、新结构、新工艺。此外全省还试制成功一批高级、精密的尖端产品。
    第四，技术革命进一步促进了文化革命的新高潮。全省工业企业都大办业余的政治、文化、技术学校，普遍建立“三结合”的科学研究小组，工人群众下班以后，都积极学习政治、学习文化，搞技术研究，从而促使技术革新和技术革命运动更加深入持久地向前发展。
    技术革新和技术革命运动走上新的阶段，经历了大造舆论，大摆矛盾，突破重点，全面展开的过程。从去年10月开始，我们通过先进生产者代表大会等一系列活动，大造技术革命的舆论，特别是去年12月全省党的第三届代表大会，广泛地交流了大搞技术革新的经验，明确了技术革新的目标、要求和方法，进一步调动全党全民大搞技术革新的积极性。随着生产的持续大跃进，必须进一步解决劳动力、设备能力、原材料、燃料不足的矛盾。因此，我们一方面积极推广先进经验，一方面提出“增产不增人”的口号，从技术革新方面寻找增加生产的出路。当时，这种劳动力和设备能力不足的矛盾，最突出的是在手工操作比重较大的铁、木、竹业，以及农村兴修水利和积肥，基本建设土石方工程等方面。运动首先从这些关键开始，很快地形成了各行各业技术革新、技术革命运动的新高潮。
    技术革新和技术革命运动，既是生产革命运动，又是思想革命运动。因此，必须坚持政治挂帅，坚持高速度，深入开展学习毛泽东思想运动，保证思想革命领先。在反右整风和社会主义教育运动以后，总路线、高速度思想日益深入人心，广大职工进一步明确大搞技术革新和技术革命是实现社会主义建设持续大跃进的主要途径，他们在党的总路线指导下，抱着“改造世界”，“向自然进军”的雄心大志，迅速掀起了革新热潮。但是，也有一些人对于要不要革新，依靠什么人革新等问题，有着右倾保守思想。他们认为“革新同生产有矛盾”，“设备缺，材料少，技术差，不能搞革新”；有的在革新略有成绩时就产生到顶思想。这些思想显然是十分错误的。技术革新上的先进思想与落后思想的矛盾，实质上反映了为实现共产主义而高速度地发展生产力，还是因循守旧、停步不前的两条道路的斗争。如果不狠狠批判右倾保守思想，技术革新和技术革命运动就不可能轰轰烈烈地开展起来。为此，我们采取正面教育和树立对立面摆事实、讲道理、开展鸣放辩论相结合，召开现场会议和多级干部会议相结合，本厂、本地树立标兵和到外厂外地学习取经相结合，通过报纸、广播、展览会大造声势和组织党团员、积极分子密切联系群众相结合，深入细致地进行政治思想工作。学习毛泽东思想的运动，是反对右倾，解放思想，推动技术革命不断发展的伟大动力。杭州市工业系统有三分之一的职工约四万人参加学习毛主席著作。杭州工具厂在大闹自动化半自动化的过程中，一部分职工存在迷信思想和畏难情绪，党总支就组织全体职工学习毛主席的“矛盾论”、“愚公移山”、“为人民服务”等著作。当全厂实现半自动化后，有少数人评头品足，说“自动线搞得太早了”。党总支又及时组织职工学习“马克思主义者应当如何对待新生事物”等文章。在毛主席的思想照耀下，该厂职工不断提高认识，进一步坚定了不断革命论的思想，明确了“新生事物一定要胜利”，“新生事物的成长，要经过严重的斗争”的观点，他们说：“毛主席著作像太阳，照得我们心里亮，征服困难赛愚公，大搞革新当闯将”。只经过短短一段时间，车床全部实现半自动化，全厂机械化、半机械化操作，已由去年12月的40％提高到80％，2月份日产值比12月份增长16％，真正做到思想领先，并使思想革命、技术革命、生产革命三者密切结合，互相促进。
    大搞群众运动，广泛开展内外三结合，发扬共产主义协作精神，是运动迅速全面展开的重要保证。毛主席说：“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素，人多议论多，热气高，干劲大”。广大职工直接参加生产，对生产的过程最熟悉，对改进设备，提高技术的要求也最迫切，只要我们放手发动群众，就会发出无穷无尽的力量。杭州联名竹器厂六十多岁的老工人赵祖其，自画图纸，自找材料，苦战三天，创造了削竹机；嘉兴木器厂聋哑工人周友才创造了打钉机，工效比手工操作提高三倍。广大工人摆脱手工操作以后，欢呼“第二次解放”。嘉兴木器厂老工人康和尚长期手工劳动，背驼关节痛，在实现机械操作后，感激地说：“共产党早来十年，我就不会犯这个毛病了”。在大搞群众运动中，我们主要是依靠老工人、青年工人中的积极分子和技术人员中的左派，并且以“三结合”革新小组为中心，同广大群众比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进、大协作的劳动竞赛结合起来，造成人人动手、处处革新、你追我赶、你学我帮的局面。领导干部亲临前线，同广大群众并肩作战，对群众的积极性是莫大的鼓舞。工人说：“干部有决心，我们有信心，干群一条心，越干越有劲。”厂内的三结合发展到企业、学校、科学研究机关的三结合，这是群众运动的一个重大发展。在运动中，浙江大学、杭州大学、省化工研究所和纺织工业研究所等单位，采取“挂钩”协作、分片包干的办法，组织师生深入工矿企业，解决了许多有关机械化和自动化的技术问题。浙江大学化工系七十多个教师和四、五年级四百多个学生，通过生产实践，提出了一百多项技术革新项目，写出了许多科学技术论文，他们表示今后要更加努力改造思想，把自己锻炼成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。全面的技术革新，大大发扬了企业之间、行业之间、地区之间的共产主义协作精神，“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”的高尚风格到处出现，许多单位不仅带着先进经验，而且带着物资设备去支援别人。杭州德胜坝码头的搬运工人，在七天内实现搬运装卸机械化半机械化，很重要的一个原因，是得到了交通机械修配厂等二十七个单位的援助。现在这种大协作，已经从物资设备上的互通有无，发展到生产技术上的互相帮助；从某一件任务的临时协作，发展到全面的长期的协作。这种共产主义大协作，使群众运动在党的领导下，从比较分散，走向更加集中，形成了以工人阶级为中心的全社会的运动，不仅产生了巨大的物质力量，而且正在更深刻地改变着广大群众的精神面貌。
    坚决执行一整套“两条腿走路”的方针。“两条腿走路”的方针，是党中央、毛主席的伟大的战略思想在社会主义建设事业上的具体体现。坚决执行这个方针，就可以把最广大群众的积极性全面充分地调动起来，发扬他们的无穷智慧和创造才能，集中到社会主义建设事业上面，从而不断出现“奇迹”。仙居县是浙江省一个偏僻的山区县，这个县的建筑公司只有一百多名工人，他们发扬“穷棒子闹革命”的精神，两个多月内用土办法创制二十多种新机具。做圆盘锯没有钢板，找了一个旧汽油桶的底来代替；试制木工刨床，缺少刨刀，工人们用搞副业得来的零钱自己买；别人的打地坪器是用马达带动的，他们就全部用木头，一个人推着走。现在他们已由完全靠手工操作转变到60％的机械化半机械化操作，劳动生产率增长45％。“穷办法办法无穷”，仙居县的事实完全证明了这一点。洋土结合的方针，不仅完全适用于中、小型企业，也完全适用于现代化工厂。例如杭州电厂，主要生产过程原来就是高度机械化的，但厂内运输和机修车间等方面，手工劳动却占了全厂40％左右的劳动力。他们依靠群众，大搞革新，实现了运煤、粉碎、加煤和铸工、锻工的机械化、半机械化、连续化，手工操作的比重迅速下降到17％。他们用土办法改进发电机的通风部分，提高出力33％；用煤气和煤混合烧锅炉，提高出力15％。他们还制造成功土汽轮机等，为全民办电开辟了新道路；同时，正积极从调配电力，预报事故等方面研究自动化的新技术。这说明贯彻执行洋土结合，大中小结合等一整套方针，在技术革新和技术革命的伟大群众运动中，具有多么重大的意义。
      工业生产、建设的技术革新内容极其广泛，必须全面规划，抓住重点，统一领导，分线作战。既要抓住中心和各个时期的重点，又要带动全面，把解决生产关键和企业的全面改造结合起来。什么是我们要抓的重点？从我们省的具体情况来说，在实现机械化、半机械化方面，重点是抓用劳动力最多，手工操作比重最大的行业和工种，如铁、木、竹业、土石方工程，搬运装卸等；在生产方面，重点是抓煤炭、钢铁等原材料和动力。从去年12月份开始，本省大多数地区和企业，都根据本身的具体情况，从远处着眼，从近处着手，揭露实现今年持续大跃进的矛盾，找到生产上迫切需要解决的关键，确定重点，订出技术革新和技术革命的规划，使运动开展得有计划，有步骤，既轰轰烈烈，又踏踏实实。在运动中，各级领导还分成几条战线，指定专人负责，成立办公机构，按行业作出战役规划，一个战役接着一个战役。这样做法的好处是力量集中，主攻方向明确，声势很大，易于攻破关键，使运动迅速收到显著效果，鼓舞群众的积极性和创造性。浙江麻纺织厂把系统的技术改造项目归纳成一条“大龙”，把解决当前生产关键的革新项目，归纳成八条“小龙”，从厂、车间到小组都有明确的目标和小段规划，两个多月来，全厂共实现革新项目一千二百余件，使麻袋产量提前十三天超额完成第一季度计划。
    狠抓巩固，推广和提高工作，大力扶持新生事物，从各方面创造条件，使革新事迹到处开花结果。我们已经实现的革新成果，绝大部分是科学的，但一般的都应该通过生产，进一步鉴定革新的设备和机具，积极提高工人的操作技术水平，使革新机具逐步趋向完善，使新技术为更多的人所熟练掌握。杭州德胜坝码头实现装卸机械化半机械化以后，开始时工人不会使用机器，加上木制的装卸设备不够坚固，雨淋日晒变了形，整个码头的七条“龙”一度全部停止运转。经过进一步的改进提高，广泛开展操作大练兵，积极改进管理工作以后，80％以上的工人迅速学会了使用机器，“死龙”又很快地变成“活龙”，3月20日后的平均日产量比前五天提高70％以上。为了使革新成效迅速开花结果，必须雷厉风行地限期推广行之有效的先进经验，对于还不够完善的先进经验，要通过现场会议，布置有关单位进行重点试验，培养技术力量，在更大范围内创造经验，取长补短，全面推广，不断提高。随着技术革新和技术革命运动的全面展开，劳动组织、生产管理、工资定额和规章制度等方面，已经出现了不相适应的情况。这是一个值得十分重视的问题。它告诉我们，在进行技术革新和技术革命的同时，必须对生产关系和上层建筑的某些方面进行改革。只有这样，技术革新和技术革命运动，才能占领一个阵地，巩固一个阵地，在普及的基础上提高，在发展中巩固，然后进一步促进运动的发展和普及，使运动一浪高一浪地前进。
    技术革新和技术革命运动的发展过程，是一个认清形势，解放思想，指明方向，不断革命的过程。现在的任务，就是要我们抓住先进，大力加强政治思想工作，大造声势，开展比、学、赶、帮的群众运动。同时要更好地做出全面规划，提出前进的方向。浙江省的技术革新和技术革命运动，前一阶段虽已取得一定成绩，但同全国先进地区比较起来还很不够。我们决心不断革命，不断跃进，加速实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化，成倍地提高劳动生产率，保证生产建设的持续大跃进。在大搞机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的同时，大力开展增产节约运动，大力增产原料、材料、燃料，大搞原材料的综合利用，全民办煤炭，办钢铁，办电力，办土铁路。积极推进工程设计、产品设计的技术革新，广泛采用新技术、新结构、新工艺、新材料，增加新产品，并进行设计方法的革命。大办职工业余政治文化技术学校，有计划地从工人中培养一批又红又专的工程技术人员；加强科学研究工作，使技术革新同科学研究密切结合起来，逐步攀登现代科学技术的高峰。
    我们相信，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，树立共产主义的雄心大志，以共产主义的思想建设社会主义，以不断革命的思想指导运动，依靠广大群众，并经常向各地学习先进经验和先进技术，技术革新和技术革命运动一定会取得更多更大的成绩，社会主义建设一定会高速度地持续大跃进。
