    Taiyuan City's Technical Forces Cooperate on a Grand Scale
    Solving More Than 1,700 Technical Problems in Two Months, Overcoming Many Advanced and Cutting-Edge Projects
    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 8th dispatch) Taiyuan is organizing city-wide technical forces to cooperate, jointly solve major problems encountered in technical innovation, research and manufacture advanced, precision, cutting-edge products and new products, and powerfully promote the rapid improvement of the city's technical level.
    Taiyuan City's organization of large-scale collaboration began in 1958. At that time, the purpose of organizing collaboration was to solve the shortage of certain raw materials and some material supplies, to exchange what they had and adjust each other's needs, and to use limited material resources in the places where they were most needed. Now, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, the technical force collaboration carried out in Taiyuan City has enriched the content of communist large-scale collaboration and entered a new stage of development.
    In 1960, Taiyuan City faced a great situation of continuous great leaps forward. The task of trial-manufacturing new products has increased exponentially, many of which are advanced, precision, cutting-edge and new projects; with the development of the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement, there have also emerged major technical problems that cannot be solved by one factory alone. At the beginning of this year, quite a few enterprises undertaking the task of trial-manufacturing advanced, precision, cutting-edge and new products, as well as some enterprises encountering technical difficulties in technical innovation, raised difficulties to the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. At the same time, the Municipal Party Committee discovered that the difficulties raised by some units had already been resolved in other units. Based on this situation, the Municipal Party Committee decided to organize city-wide technical force collaboration, to overcome technical obstacles in an organized, planned, step-by-step, and focused manner. The main form of collaboration is to organize collaboration between factories, professional technical schools, and scientific research institutions, which people call "three-way combination" outside the factory; this "three-way combination" outside the factory, combined with the "three-way combination" of cadres, workers, and technicians inside the factory, has become a powerful driving force for promoting the high-speed improvement of the city's technical level. In the past two months, the city has solved more than 1,700 technical problems through this technical collaboration. In March alone, eight advanced, precision, cutting-edge and new technical projects were solved.
    Although this collaborative relationship has just been established, it has shown great superiority. The first is to solve many major technical problems in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. For example, the machine tools manufactured by the tool workshop of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory for the establishment of automatic production lines have been successfully trial-produced, but they cannot be connected together. The Taiyuan Institute of Technology, in order to support them, provided technical data on the one hand and sent students to the factory to help, and finally solved the problem. After the successful trial of silicate large blocks by the Second Construction Company of Shanxi Province, a large number of ball mills are needed for widespread promotion. Through technical collaboration, Taiyuan Boiler Factory and other units took out the ball mills in production to support them, so that this advanced experience could be promoted. The organization of large-scale technical collaboration not only guaranteed the consolidation, popularization and improvement of the achievements of technical innovation, but also promoted the healthy development of the movement along the correct scientific and mass-based track.
    Secondly, it has opened up broad avenues for the whole Party and the whole people to attack cutting-edge technology. Some enterprises in Taiyuan City have been stagnant in the process of trial-manufacturing advanced, precision, cutting-edge products and new products due to a certain technical link lagging behind. After the organization of large-scale technical collaboration, the wisdom of the broad masses of workers was concentrated, the strengths of various enterprises were brought into play, and technical "consultations" of different scales were organized when encountering cutting-edge technical problems. As a result, the tasks of each factory were completed more, faster, better and more economically.
    The greatest advantage of organizing large-scale technical collaboration is also manifested in: it is an important means to improve the city's technical level at high speed and rapidly change the backward state of technology. Through the city-wide technical collaboration, all technical forces can do their best, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and give full play to their role in a centralized and unified manner, providing good conditions for the comprehensive and rapid improvement of the technical level of a region.
    At present, Taiyuan City's large-scale technical force collaboration is further developing throughout the city. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has organized the city's main engineers to study and formulate technical collaboration plans, and actively establish city-wide technical information work and technical libraries, and organize regular and irregular technical experience exchange and promotion meetings, so as to promote technical collaboration to a more perfect stage of development.

### 厂内厂外、学校工厂、各行各业紧密结合  太原全市技术力量大协作  两月解决一千七百多个技术问题，攻破不少高级尖端项目

    厂内厂外、学校工厂、各行各业紧密结合
    太原全市技术力量大协作
    两月解决一千七百多个技术问题，攻破不少高级尖端项目
    本报太原8日电　太原组织全市技术力量协作，共同解决技术革新中碰到的重大问题；研究、制造高级、精密、尖端产品和新产品，有力地促进了全市技术水平的迅速提高。
    太原市组织大协作是从1958年开始的。当时组织协作的目的是为了解决某些原料材料和一些物资供应不足问题，互通有无、互相调剂，把有限的物力用到最需要的地方去。现在，在以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动中，太原市开展的技术力量大协作，使共产主义大协作有了更丰富的内容，进入了新的发展阶段。
    1960年，太原市面临着持续大跃进的大好形势。新产品试制任务成倍增长，其中许多是高级、精密、尖端和新的项目；随着全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动的展开，也出现了不是一个工厂可以解决的重大技术问题。今年年初，就有不少担负高级、精密、尖端和新的产品试制任务的企业，以及一些在技术革新中遇到技术难关的企业，向中共太原市委提出了困难。与此同时，市委又发现一些单位提出的困难，恰恰在另一些单位中早已得到解决。根据这种情况，市委决定组织全市性的技术力量大协作，有组织、有计划、有步骤、有重点地攻克技术关。协作的主要形式是组织工厂、专业技术学校和科学研究机关协作，人们称它为厂外“三结合”；这种厂外“三结合”，再同厂内干部、工人、技术人员的“三结合”结合起来，就成了促进全市技术水平高速度提高的强大动力。两个月来，全市通过这种技术协作，解决了一千七百多个技术问题。仅3月份，就解决了八个高级、精密、尖端和新的技术项目。
    这种协作关系虽然刚开始建立，却显示了巨大的优越性。首先是解决了技术革新和技术革命运动中的许多重大技术问题。例如太原矿山机器厂工具车间为建立自动生产线制造的机床已经试制成功，但是联不到一起。太原工学院为支援他们，一面提供技术资料，一面派学生到厂里帮忙，终于解决了这个问题。山西省第二建筑公司试验矽酸盐大型砌块成功以后，要普遍推广，需要大量球磨机。经过技术协作，太原锅炉厂等单位，把正在生产的球磨机拿出支援他们，使这项先进经验得到推广。由于组织技术大协作，不仅保证了技术革新成果的巩固、普及和提高，还促使运动沿着正确的科学的全民的轨道，健康地向前发展。
    其次，为全党、全民向尖端技术进攻开辟了广阔的道路。太原市有些企业在试制高级、精密、尖端产品和新产品的过程中，曾经由于某一个技术环节跟不上而停顿过。组织技术大协作以后，集中了广大职工的智慧，发挥了各个企业的长处，碰到尖端技术问题就组织不同规模的技术“会诊”，结果各厂任务完成得又多、又快、又好、又省。
    组织技术大协作的最大优越性还表现在：它是高速度提高全市技术水平，迅速改变技术落后面貌的重要手段。通过全市技术大协作，可以使所有的技术力量各尽所能，取长补短，并集中统一地发挥他们的作用，为一个地区技术水平的全面迅速提高提供了良好条件。
    目前，太原市的技术力量大协作正在全市进一步发展。中共太原市委已组织全市的主要工程师研究制定技术协作规划，并积极建立全市性的技术情报工作和技术图书馆，组织定期、不定期的技术经验交流和推广会议，以便把技术协作推向更完善的发展阶段。
