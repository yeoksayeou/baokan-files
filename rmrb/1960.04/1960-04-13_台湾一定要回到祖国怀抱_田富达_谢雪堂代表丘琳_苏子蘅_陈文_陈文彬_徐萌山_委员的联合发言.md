Taiwan Must Return to the Embrace of the Motherland
Joint Speech by Deputies Tian Fuda, Xie Xuetang, Representing Qiu Lin, Su Ziheng, Chen Wen, Chen Wenbin, and Xu Mengshan

Chairman, esteemed delegates, esteemed members:

We have listened to the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the report by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. We feel extremely excited and express our complete agreement and resolute support.

	The People of Taiwan Love the Motherland and Hate U.S. Imperialism Even More
As people from Taiwan Province, we feel particularly excited and encouraged in the face of the glorious achievements of national construction in 1959 and the magnificent 1960 plan, which reflects the great ambitions of the people of the whole country. In particular, during our recent inspections and visits to Anhui, Henan, Wuhan, Guangdong, Luda, Beijing, Shanghai and other places, we have personally witnessed the prosperous scene of the motherland, which has enabled us to specifically appreciate the excellent situation everywhere full of vitality. Everywhere we have seen the products of Mao Zedong Thought—the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes—these three magic weapons of socialist construction have exerted tremendous power, changing the face of the motherland and the spiritual outlook of the people.

In the cities, we have seen industrial construction established from scratch, from small to large, from indigenous to modern, in the thousands and tens of thousands, changing the face of the cities. Cities with no industry have been transformed into industrial bases, and consumer cities have been transformed into production cities. Taking Luoyang as an example, this "ancient capital of ten dynasties" had only sixteen small factories with rudimentary equipment and a total of only one hundred and sixty workers before liberation. But now it has world-class modern factories of immense scale—the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, the Ball Bearing Plant, the Mining Machinery Plant, and so on. The traces of the old city are disappearing day by day, and a new industrial city, mainly based on the machinery industry, has been established here. When we saw our country's own red "Dongfanghong" tractors here, we were all extremely excited. Hefei was a small city before liberation and was even more of a place of "poverty and blankness," but now its face is changing rapidly. Factories stand in great numbers, schools line the streets, buildings rise up, and a modern industrial base has taken shape.

In the countryside, everything is also being renewed. In particular, after the people's communes were established, rural construction developed by leaps and bounds. As the peasants of Anhui said: "A great transformation in one year (referring to the land reform), a great change in eight years, a great leap forward in two years, and a great change in outlook." Water conservancy construction throughout the country has been developing rapidly and has exerted tremendous power. Taking the Shi Pi Hang irrigation project in Anhui, which we visited, it is a large-scale water conservancy project several times larger than the Suez Canal, but 75% of it has been completed in just these two winter and spring seasons. It introduces water to the hills, irrigating more than twelve million mu of farmland in Huainan, which can change the phenomenon of "a minor drought after five days without rain, a major drought after ten days without rain, yellowing seedlings after half a month without rain, and crops that can be burned after a month without rain" before liberation. This project already irrigated more than one million mu of farmland in the summer of 1959 during an unprecedented drought in decades, guaranteeing a bumper harvest. In the plains, the movement to create a network of rivers and water paddies has also been developing rapidly. On the 35,000 square kilometers of land in the Huaibei Plain, a large number of river network projects have been carried out, and some areas have basically achieved a network of rivers, transforming Huaibei into a land south of the Yangtze River. Taking the Sanyeba People's Commune in Sixian County, which is famous throughout the country, as an example, after the river network was realized, the ditches and rivers are connected, the ponds and dams are linked, the river embankments are lined with lush trees, apricot blossoms are in full bloom, and the fragrance is fragrant. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side-line production, and fishery have all made great progress. The pre-liberation phenomenon of being flooded nine years out of ten, with a yield of only sixty catties per mu, has been changed, and after the severe droughts and floods of 1958 and 1959, not only was no disaster caused, but on the contrary, grain production increased by half each year. It has indeed become a land of fish and rice. For example, Guangdong Province suffered a major flood last year, the largest in a century, but it not only recovered quickly but also achieved a bumper harvest, and the lives of the disaster victims were even better than before the disaster. Here, we cannot help but think of the tragic situation in Taiwan, which is controlled by the American invaders, where floods and droughts occur every year. In the great flood in central and southern Taiwan last year, hundreds of thousands of people were homeless, and many died of starvation. This year, the drought situation in Taiwan in March is extremely serious. Half of the farmland cannot be planted due to lack of water, and the planted farmland has already begun to crack. The water in Sun Moon Lake is almost dry, the power supply is affected, and factories have begun to shut down or reduce production, making people's lives difficult. This phenomenon is mainly due to the destruction of Taiwan's urban and rural economy, the disrepair of water conservancy, the deforestation of mountains and forests, and the loss of water and soil. Please look at the large-scale water conservancy projects, flood prevention, and drought resistance formed in our motherland's mainland and the bumper harvests in disaster years, and the tragic situation of the disaster victims in Taiwan. What a clear contrast!

From our inspection, whether in rural areas or cities, we can see that on the basis of the continuous great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of labor productivity, the material living standards of the people throughout the country have also generally improved. At the warm request of the people, urban people's communes, street industries, canteens, nurseries, service stations, etc., have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain in many cities across the country. We have seen that urban people's communes can not only promote the high-speed development of urban economic and cultural construction, but also the best form of organizing and improving people's lives. The street industry started in Xicheng District, Beijing in the second half of 1958 had an output value of more than 2 million yuan, and it increased to 39 million yuan in 1959. In the first quarter of this year alone, the output value was more than 43 million yuan. At present, there are 594 street production units. A large number of housewives have been liberated from housework and participated in production, increasing their income and generally improving their living standards. The emergence of this organizational form has changed the relationship between people from "each sweeps the snow in front of their own door" to a new atmosphere of mutual care and cooperation. This is a great thing. We warmly cheer the growth of this new thing.

Esteemed delegates, esteemed members: When we are here rejoicing for the great achievements of our motherland's socialist construction and our better life, we love our motherland more, hate U.S. imperialism more, and miss our Taiwan compatriots even more. Today, Taiwan has not yet been liberated, and Taiwan compatriots are still living in dire straits. This is entirely the result of the U.S. aggressors' armed occupation of Taiwan.

	U.S. Imperialism's Aggression Against Taiwan Destroys the Economic Life of the People of Taiwan
Since the U.S. aggressors occupied Taiwan, they have increasingly intensified their political, economic, and military control over Taiwan, and strengthened their exploitation and oppression of the people of Taiwan. The U.S. aggressors have taken measures such as so-called "U.S. aid," private investment, and dumping surplus materials to control the economic lifeline and the Taiwan market, seize most of Taiwan's major enterprises, such as transportation, electricity, aluminum, shipbuilding, machinery, and other industries, and cruelly exploit the people of Taiwan; plundered high profits, and most or all of them have been remitted back to the United States. The U.S. military has also occupied a large amount of land belonging to Taiwanese farmers to build airports, military camps, and other military facilities, causing the vast majority of Taiwanese farmers to have no land to cultivate, no homes to live in, and to be displaced. U.S. capital has penetrated into all aspects of Taiwan's food crops, cash crops, animal husbandry, forestry, and fishery, causing serious damage to Taiwan's agriculture. All of this economic aggression has caused industrial and commercial enterprises to close down one after another, suicides have occurred repeatedly, and the economic life of the people of Taiwan has been completely destroyed.

In the military sphere, in addition to intensifying control over the Chiang army and strengthening military bases, establishing missile bases, and test-firing missiles, the U.S. aggressors have recently been creating tension in the Taiwan Strait. A large number of U.S. invading troops have been conducting large-scale military exercises in the Taiwan Strait since March 16, which is another blatant military provocation against the Chinese people. This military provocation by the United States has seriously threatened the security of the Chinese people and peace in the Far East. But the Chinese people will never be intimidated. If U.S. imperialism dares to carry out a war adventure, the result will inevitably be that it will be buried in the vast ocean.

	The U.S. Aggressors' Attempt to Permanently Occupy Taiwan Will Never Succeed
In order to attempt to legitimize the illegal occupation of Taiwan and turn Taiwan into a U.S. colony and military base, the U.S. aggressors have recently been more blatantly playing the conspiracy of creating "two Chinas." On October 22 last year, Eisenhower issued the so-called "Taiwan independence" remarks; on October 31, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued the so-called "Conlon Report," openly proposing the establishment of the so-called "Republic of Taiwan" in Taiwan; in November last year, the U.S. State Department issued a booklet on Taiwan, stating unequivocally that the U.S. policy on Taiwan is to permanently "firmly occupy" this place, indicating that the United States is plotting to isolate Taiwan, and then to place Taiwan under trusteeship, plotting to move from "supporting" the Chiang Kai-shek clique to abandoning the Chiang Kai-shek clique, so that Taiwan will eventually become a U.S. colony and war base. Other U.S. congressmen and bourgeois newspapers also frequently touted fallacies such as "trusteeship of Taiwan" and "Taiwan independence."

However, we want to warn the U.S. aggressors that the U.S. conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and attempt to permanently occupy Taiwan will never succeed. Because this conspiracy is unjust and unpopular. The great Chinese people of 650 million who have stood up will never agree, and the Taiwan compatriots firmly oppose it. The just and peace-loving people all over the world have severely condemned this shameless conspiracy, and the U.S. aggressors have become increasingly isolated. This conspiracy will be completely defeated!

Taiwanese compatriots, who have the same glorious patriotic and anti-imperialist traditions as the people of the motherland and are unwilling to be slaves of the United States, have been fighting one after another in recent years to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. Taiwanese workers resolutely oppose the intensification of U.S. capital's aggression and plunder in Taiwan. More than 1,000 workers at the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation in Keelung have been engaged in anti-American struggles since U.S. capital took over the company, and there have been repeated incidents of strikes and walkouts. After U.S. capital intended to buy and take over the Taiwan Paper Corporation, it aroused great anger among the workers of the company. Therefore, when the investigation team of U.S. capital came to the company to conduct an investigation, the Chiang Kai-shek clique had to send a large number of plainclothes police and secret agents to provide protection to prevent the angry workers from taking "radical actions" against the Americans. Even some of the "legislators" and "provincial assemblymen" of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique have expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. aggression. Recently, on February 28, more than 30,000 residents of Taipei angrily rushed into the "forbidden zone" to oppose the U.S. military's occupation of "Yangming Mountain Park," which fully demonstrates that the anti-American sentiment of Taiwan compatriots is rising.

	Oppose the Aggression of U.S. Imperialism and Strive for Taiwan to Return to the Embrace of the Motherland as Soon as Possible
We firmly believe that the military and civilians compatriots in Taiwan will unite under the banner of patriotism and anti-imperialism, unite against foreign enemies, jointly oppose all acts of aggression by the United States in Taiwan, resolutely oppose the United States' conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and strive to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. With the continued great leap forward in the socialist construction of the motherland and the increasing strength of the socialist camp, this desire will surely be realized.

We express to the congress that the people of Taiwan Province on the mainland must work together with the people of the motherland, under the leadership of the Party, strive to transform themselves, resolutely implement the Party's General Line, go all out, aim high, actively participate in the mass movements of technological revolution and cultural revolution, contribute all our strength in various work positions, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan, to accelerate the construction of the socialist motherland, and to fight for the liberation of Taiwan!

专栏：

    台湾一定要回到祖国怀抱
    田富达　谢雪堂代表丘琳　苏子蘅　陈文　陈文彬　徐萌山　委员的联合发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我们听了李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告以及人大常委会的工作报告和陈叔通副主席的报告，感到无比的兴奋，并表示完全同意和坚决拥护。
      台湾人民热爱祖国更加痛恨美帝国主义
    作为台湾省人的我们，面对着1959年国家建设的辉煌成就，和反映全国人民雄心大志的宏伟的1960年计划，特别感到兴奋和鼓舞。尤其我们最近在安徽、河南、武汉、广东、旅大、北京、上海等地视察和参观当中，亲眼看到了祖国的繁荣景象，使我们具体体会了遍地都是生气勃勃的大好形势；到处都看到了毛泽东思想的产物——总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这三个社会主义建设的法宝发挥了巨大威力，改变了祖国山河的面貌和人民的精神面貌。
    在城市，我们看到了工业建设从无到有，从小到大，从土到洋，成千成万地建立起来，改变了城市的面貌。使无工业的城市变为工业基地，使消费城市变为生产城市。就以洛阳为例来说，这个“十朝古都”，在解放前，只有十六个设备简陋的小工厂，工人一共只有一百六十人。但是现在已经具有规模巨大的世界第一流的现代化大工厂——第一拖拉机制造厂、滚珠轴承厂、矿山机械厂等等。过去那个古老城市的痕迹一天天地消失下去，一个新型的以机械工业为主的工业城市已经在这里建立起来了。当我们在这里看到了我国自制的红色的“东方红”拖拉机的时候，我们都万分地激动。合肥在解放前是一个小城市，更是“一穷二白”的地方，但是现在它的面貌真是瞬息万变，工厂林立，学校成街，大楼矗立，现代化的工业基地已经形成了。
    在农村，也是万象更新。尤其人民公社化以后，农村建设有了飞跃的发展。正如安徽农民所说的：“一年大翻身（指土改），八年大改变，二年大跃进，面貌大改观”。全国各地的水利建设已经在迅速发展，而且发挥了巨大威力。以我们参观的安徽史渒杭灌溉工程来说，它是比苏伊士运河大几倍的大型水利工程，但仅仅在这两个冬春里就完成了75％。它将水源引入丘陵，灌溉淮南一千二百多万亩农地，可以改变解放前“五天不雨小旱，十天不雨大旱，半月不雨青苗黄，一月不雨禾可燎”的现象。这个工程已经在1959年夏季当数十年所未有的大旱下，放水灌溉了一百多万亩农田，保证了丰收。在平原，大搞河网化、水稻化的运动也迅速开展起来。在淮北平原三万五千平方公里的土地上，已经做了大量的河网工程，部分地区已经基本上实现了河网化，使淮北变江南。以全国闻名的宿县三八人民公社来说，实现河网化以后，已经沟河相通，塘坝相连，河堤上绿树成林，杏花盛开，香味扑鼻，农林牧副渔都取得了很大发展，改变了解放前十年九淹，每亩产量只不过六十斤的多灾低产的现象，并且经过了1958年和1959年两年的严重旱涝的考验，不仅没有造成灾害，相反，粮食产量每年增加了一半，确实已经成为鱼米之乡了。又如广东省去年虽然遭到百年来的特大洪水，但不仅很快地恢复，而且得到了丰收，灾民生活还比灾前有所改善。在这里不得不使我们联想到在美国侵略者控制下的台湾，年年水旱成灾的悲惨情况。台湾中南部在去年的大水灾中，有几十万人无家可归，饿死了很多人。今年3月台湾旱灾情况极端严重，一半农田因缺水无法插秧，已经插秧的农田则已经开始龟裂；日月潭水已快干涸，电力供应受到影响，工厂开始停工或减产，民不聊生。这种现象，主要是由于台湾城乡经济遭到摧残，水利失修，山林滥伐，水土流失所造成的。请看看我们祖国大陆的大兴水利、防涝抗旱而形成的灾年丰收与台湾灾民悲惨情况，这是多么显明的对比呀！
    从我们的视察当中，不论在农村或城市，都可以看到在工农业生产继续大跃进和劳动生产率提高的基础上，全国人民的物质生活水平也都普遍提高了。在人民群众热烈的要求下，城市人民公社，街道工业，食堂，托儿所，服务站等，像雨后春笋一样在全国许多城市里普遍开花。我们看到了城市人民公社不仅可以促进城市经济、文化建设的高速度发展，而且也是组织和提高人民生活的最好形式。北京西城区1958年下半年开始办的街道工业，产值是二百多万元，1959年就增加到三千九百万元，今年仅仅在第一季度就有产值四千三百余万元。目前已经有五百九十四个街道生产单位。大批家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来参加生产，增加了收入，普遍提高了生活水平。由于这一组织形式的出现，使人与人之间的关系由“各人自扫门前雪”一变而为互相关怀，互相协作的新风气。这是一件莫大好事。我们热烈欢呼这一新生事物的成长。
    各位代表、各位委员：当我们在这里为我们祖国社会主义建设的伟大成就和我们的美好生活欢欣鼓舞的时候，我们更加热爱祖国，更加痛恨美帝国主义，也更怀念我们的台湾同胞。今天台湾还没有解放，台湾同胞还生活在水深火热之中，这完全是由于美国侵略者武装霸占台湾的结果。
      美帝国主义对台湾的侵略破坏了台湾人民经济生活
    美国侵略者霸占台湾以来，日益加紧对台湾的政治、经济和军事的控制，加强剥削和压迫台湾人民。美国侵略者采取所谓“美援”、私人投资、倾销剩余物资等办法控制了台湾的经济命脉和台湾市场，夺取了台湾大部分主要企业，例如交通运输、电力、铝业、造船、机械等工业，残酷地剥削台湾人民；掠夺了高额利润，并且大部分或全部汇返美国。美军还霸占了台湾农民的大量土地来建筑机场、军营和其他军事设施，使得广大台湾农民无地可种，无家可住，流离失所。美国资本已经渗入到台湾粮食作物、经济作物、畜牧业、林业、渔业各个方面，使台湾农业遭受到严重损害。这一切经济侵略，使工商企业纷纷倒闭，自杀事件屡屡发生，彻底破坏了台湾人民的经济生活。
    在军事方面，美国侵略者除加紧控制蒋军和加强军事基地，设立导弹基地，并试射导弹之外，最近以来，一直在台湾海峡制造紧张局势。大批美国侵略军从3月16日起在台湾海峡进行大规模的军事演习，这是对中国人民的又一次猖狂的军事挑衅。美国这种军事挑衅已经对中国人民的安全和远东和平造成严重威胁。但中国人民是永远吓唬不倒的，美帝国主义如果胆敢进行战争冒险，其结果必然是被葬送在汪洋大海里。
      美国侵略者企图永久霸占台湾的阴谋是绝不能得逞的
    美国侵略者为了企图使非法霸占台湾的侵略行为合法化，使台湾成为美国的殖民地和军事基地，最近时期更加露骨地玩弄制造“两个中国”的阴谋。去年10月22日艾森豪威尔发表所谓“台湾独立”的言论；10月31日美国参议院外交委员会发表所谓“康伦报告”，公然提出在台湾成立所谓“台湾共和国”；去年11月间，美国国务院发表关于台湾的小册子，毫不含糊地声称，美国对台湾的政策是为了永久“牢牢占有”这块地方，表明美国正阴谋孤立台湾，进而托管台湾，阴谋从“支持”蒋介石集团走向抛弃蒋介石集团，使台湾最后变成美国的殖民地和战争基地。其他美国一些国会议员和资产阶级报刊，也经常鼓吹“托管台湾”、“台湾独立”等谬论。
    但是，我们要警告美国侵略者，美国制造“两个中国”，企图永久霸占台湾的阴谋是绝不能得逞的。因为这种阴谋是不正义的，不得人心的。已经站起来的伟大的中国六亿五千万人民绝不答应，台湾同胞坚决反对。全世界的正义的、爱好和平的人民已严厉斥责这种无耻阴谋，美国侵略者已经越来越孤立。这种阴谋必将遭到彻底的失败！
    同祖国人民一样有着光荣爱国反帝传统的，不愿做美国奴隶的台湾同胞，几年来为争取早日回到祖国怀抱而前仆后继地、不断地进行着反美斗争。台湾工人坚决反对美国资本加紧在台湾进行侵略和掠夺。基隆的台湾造船公司的一千多名工人，自从美国资本并吞这个公司以后，一直进行着反美斗争，屡次发生怠工和罢工事件。美国资本打算收买并吞台湾纸业公司以后，引起了这个公司的工人的极大愤怒。因此，当美国资本的调查团到这个公司进行调查的时候，蒋介石集团不得不派遣大批便衣警察和特务给予保护，以防止愤怒的工人对美国人采取“过激行动”。连台湾蒋介石集团的一部分“立法委员”和“省议员”对于美国的侵略行为也表示不满。最近，在2月28日，台北发生了三万多居民愤怒地冲入“禁区”反对美军霸占“阳明山公园”的事件，这充分说明了台湾同胞的反美情绪越来越高涨。
      反对美帝国主义的侵略争取台湾早日回到祖国怀抱
    我们坚信：在台湾的军民同胞一定会在爱国反帝的旗帜下团结起来，一致对外，共同反对美国在台湾的一切侵略行为，坚决反对美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，争取早日回到祖国的怀抱里来。随着祖国社会主义建设继续大跃进和社会主义阵营日益强大，这种愿望是一定能够实现的。
    我们向大会表示，在大陆的台湾省人，一定要和祖国人民一道，在党的领导下努力改造自己，坚决贯彻执行党的总路线，鼓足干劲，力争上游，积极投入技术革命和文化革命的群众运动，在各项工作岗位上贡献一切力量，为争取完成和超额完成1960年国民经济计划，为加速建设社会主义祖国而奋斗，为解放台湾而奋斗！
