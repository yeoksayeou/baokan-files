	A Blooming Flower of Friendship
	— On the Grand Occasion of the Chinese Exhibition in Pakistan

	The Chinese exhibition at the International Industrial Exposition held in Dhaka, Pakistan, has been open for nearly two months. Like a flower of friendship, the Chinese exhibition is blooming in Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan, a city of 600,000 people. During these dozens of days, it has been filled with the profound friendship of the Pakistani people for the Chinese people, and the earnest desire of the Pakistani people to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani people.

		The Story of the Magic Lamp

	The construction of the Chinese Exhibition Hall and the entire preparation process fully reflect this close friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani people. From the beginning of preparations to the opening of the Chinese Exhibition Hall, there was only a little over a month. However, to build an exhibition hall with an area of 18,000 square feet would normally take several months, given the usual construction speed here, and the preparation and transportation of the exhibits would also take a considerable amount of time. Therefore, people were once worried about whether the Chinese Exhibition Hall could open on time. However, people from all walks of life and the working masses in East Pakistan were determined to open the Chinese Pavilion as early as possible, and they helped their Chinese friends with great enthusiasm. Among the contractors and construction workers in Dhaka, the term "Chinese speed" has become a common term to describe high speed. They were determined to build the Chinese Pavilion with "Chinese speed." Therefore, with their help, the magnificent building of the Chinese Exhibition Hall was completed in just twenty days.

	The ships carrying Chinese exhibits could only dock at Chittagong in East Pakistan, and the exhibits had to be unloaded there and then transported by train to Dhaka, more than 200 miles away. In order to quickly transport the exhibits from the Chinese Exhibition Hall, when the ships carrying the exhibits arrived at the port, the workers in Chittagong unloaded the exhibits overnight, and the railway authorities tried to transport the Chinese exhibits as quickly as possible. The workers in Dhaka also unloaded the goods overnight, transporting the exhibits to the Chinese Pavilion non-stop. In this way, the Chinese Exhibition Hall finally opened smoothly and on schedule in Dhaka.

	In Dhaka, the high speed of the Chinese Exhibition Hall's construction work has become a popular topic of conversation. Only a month ago, it was still a wasteland, but a month later, a magnificent building stood there, filled with the beautiful treasures created by the Chinese people in the past ten years. Therefore, people here use many beautiful legends to praise the Chinese Exhibition Hall, saying that the appearance of the Chinese Pavilion is just like the story of the magic lamp in "Arabian Nights," miraculously shining before people's eyes in an instant.

	750,000 Visitors

	The Chinese Exhibition Hall has attracted great interest from the Pakistani people. During the days of the Chinese Pavilion's exhibition, a constant stream of Pakistani visitors flocked to the Chinese Pavilion. Even in the first ten days of January this year, when the advance team of the Chinese Exhibition Hall first appeared on the streets of Dhaka and the sign of the Chinese Pavilion was just erected on the construction site, people rushed to inquire about the opening date of the exhibition hall. On the afternoon of February 9, when the Governor of East Pakistan, Zakir Hussain, presided over the opening ceremony of the Chinese Pavilion, several thousand people gathered outside the exhibition hall, standing for three hours until the doors of the exhibition hall were opened. On the evening of the opening day, within just three hours, 20,000 people visited the Chinese Pavilion. Every Sunday, the Chinese Pavilion always receives 40,000 to 50,000 visitors.

	Since the end of February, it has rained frequently in Dhaka, and the Muslims, who make up the vast majority of Dhaka's residents, are entering Ramadan. They do not eat or drink during the day and usually rarely go out. However, they still visited the Chinese Exhibition Hall in groups. By the closing date, the number of visitors to the Chinese Pavilion had reached 750,000.

	The reputation of the Chinese Pavilion has also spread from Dhaka to various parts of East and West Pakistan. From Chittagong, more than 200 miles southeast of Dhaka, from Sylhet City in the northeast, from Mymensingh, people rushed to Dhaka by train, car and plane to visit the Chinese Pavilion. The English newspaper "Eastern Examiner" in Chittagong usually has a circulation of 7,000 copies. On one day in early March, this newspaper published a special article on two pages introducing the Chinese Exhibition Hall and Chinese construction, and the circulation that day soared to 12,000 copies.

	In the Chinese Exhibition Hall, many Pakistanis saw the true face of New China for the first time. They saw various rolled steel produced by steelworkers in Anshan and Shanghai; they saw various latest models of machine tools produced by machine-tool workers in Shanghai, Wuxi, Shenyang, Qiqihar, Dalian and Kunming during the Great Leap Forward; they saw the "Dongfanghong" tractors produced by the Luoyang First Tractor Factory. They also saw charts showing the leap-forward development of the national economy since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958; they saw the abundant products of the People's Communes, saw photos introducing the public canteens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, hospitals and agricultural middle schools of the People's Communes; they saw the brightly colored silk made by textile workers in Shanghai and Hangzhou; they saw the exquisite ivory carvings in Beijing, etc. Visitors watched various products very carefully, and many people visited repeatedly, time and time again. A doctor in Dhaka visited the Chinese Exhibition Hall sixteen times in twenty days.

	When the Governor of East Pakistan, Hussain, visited the Chinese Pavilion for the first time, he carefully observed the agricultural machinery, especially the improved farm tools and new farm tools. After his visit, the East Pakistan Agricultural Management Office sent an engineer to the Chinese Exhibition Hall to study the improved farm tools, especially the Nanjing-made rice transplanter. He inquired in detail about the relevant technical information. The next day, the Agricultural Management Office sent two technicians to the Chinese Pavilion to draw sketches of the rice transplanter. Later, the Agricultural Management Office sent three technicians a third time to study those new farm tools.

	Groups of visitors, especially farmers, gathered around the "Dongfanghong" tractor produced by the Luoyang First Tractor Factory and the combine harvester produced by the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory every day, watching the performance of these machines with great interest. Two female students from Mymensingh specially traveled more than 60 miles from Dhaka to spend two afternoons in the Chinese Pavilion sketching patterns of Chinese embroidery. On one occasion, at the request of visitors, the staff of the Chinese Exhibition Hall tested the recording part of the Nanjing "Panda" brand radio. During the performance, many visitors could not help but sing in front of the recorder.

	"Long live the wisdom and strength of the Chinese people!"

	Every day, a large number of visitors warmly shook hands with the staff of the Chinese Pavilion, congratulating them on the achievements of the Chinese people. The residents of Dhaka repeatedly said enthusiastically, "Chinese brothers are moving forward at a tremendous pace. We Pakistanis are very happy about this." Please turn to the visitors' book and see, in it you can read enthusiastic praises for the socialist construction cause of the Chinese people. A Dhaka citizen enthusiastically wrote in the visitors' book: "The People's Republic of China has written an unforgettable page in the history of socialism. We congratulate it from the bottom of our hearts. We pay tribute to the heroes of New China who are carrying out socialist construction." Hundreds of visitors enthusiastically wrote in the visitors' book: "I am completely fascinated," "I am deeply attracted," "The exhibits are so beautiful, so lovely, so exquisite, so charming, I never even dreamed of it." Some viewers also enthusiastically praised China's People's Communes, saying, "The People's Communes are indeed excellent!"

	For many years, the nations of the East have been regarded by those Western colonialists as backward, underdeveloped, without hope, and without a future. But today, the situation has fundamentally changed! Some Pakistanis who have visited the Chinese Exhibition Hall said, "China has saved face for Asia. In the past, Asia was ruled by Western countries, but today, Asia is no longer afraid of them." Viewers said: "New China is a great example for underdeveloped countries," "is the pride of Asia," "China's achievements make us believe that the East will be able to compete with the West in all aspects." Indeed, all these enthusiastic words reflect the wishes of the ordinary people of Pakistan. In the visitors' book, almost every page repeatedly shouted such slogans: "Long live the People's China!" "Long live the wisdom and strength of the Chinese people!"

	Profound Friendship, Best Wishes

	Through the exhibition of the Chinese Exhibition Hall in Dhaka, the friendship between the Chinese people and the Pakistani people has been further deepened, and the mutual understanding between the two peoples has been enhanced. In these days, many touching scenes appeared in the Chinese Exhibition Hall, fully expressing the deep friendship of the Pakistani people for the Chinese people. A worker from the Dhaka Machine Repair Factory became friends with Tang Xinyu, an engineer from the Tianjin First Machine Tool Factory, after visiting the Chinese Pavilion. He came to see Tang Xinyu again the next day with his brother. The worker brought a bottle of perfume and insisted on spraying the perfume on Tang Xinyu. When Pakistani women talked to the female staff of the Chinese Pavilion, they asked their daughters to say hello to the Chinese aunts. Some workers who had worked on the construction site of the Chinese Pavilion asked to serve as guides and other jobs in the exhibition hall after the Chinese Pavilion opened, and said they were unwilling to accept any remuneration. Many Pakistanis, including students from Dhaka University and athletes from Lahore, the capital of West Pakistan, asked to exchange addresses with the staff of the Chinese Exhibition Hall in order to communicate, and hoped to get family photos of Chinese friends.

	During the exhibition, the business community in East Pakistan also expressed great interest in the Chinese Pavilion. They had many contacts with the Chinese Exhibition Delegation to discuss trade issues between the two countries. The Pakistan Jute Association of Dhaka specially invited Gao Shangneng, the head of the Chinese Exhibition Delegation, to attend a tea party. Ispahani, the president of the Jute Association, called for expanding trade between Pakistan and China at the meeting.

	When the Chinese Pavilion was about to close, many visitors were reluctant to leave. They enthusiastically said to the staff of the Chinese Exhibition Hall: "We hope you will visit our country again." A visitor wrote earnestly in the visitors' book with reluctance to say goodbye: "I thank you for coming to our country despite your hard work, and thank you for giving us the opportunity to see your amazing achievements. We hope that you will still come here in the future despite your hard work."

	In concluding this article, the reporter would like to quote a blessing to New China written by a Pakistani named "Islam" in the visitors' book, which is pregnant with lasting friendship and the best wishes. Let these precious verses fly over valleys, rivers and fields, and meet the Chinese people:

	"May your life bloom like flowers in spring;
	May your life be as full as the water waves in the rainy season;
	May your life be as beautiful as the famous flowers of autumn."

    一朵盛开的友谊之花
    ——记中国展览馆在巴基斯坦展出的盛况
    新华社记者　张海涛
    在巴基斯坦达卡地方举行的国际工业博览会的中国馆展出已经将近两个月的时间了。中国展览馆的展出，像一朵友谊之花，盛开在这个拥有六十万人口的东巴基斯坦的首府达卡，在这数十天时间内，它满载了巴基斯坦人民对中国人民的深挚的友情，满载了巴基斯坦人民要求加强中巴人民友谊的殷切的愿望。
          神灯的故事
    中国展览馆的建成和整个筹备过程就充分反映了中巴两国人民之间的这种亲切的友谊。中国展览馆从开始筹备到开幕，只有一个多月的时间。但是要修建一个一万八千平方英尺面积的展览馆，按照这里通常的建筑速度，需要几个月的时间才能建成，而展品的准备和运输工作也需要相当长的时间。因此，人们曾经担心过中国展览馆能否及时开幕。但是东巴基斯坦各界人士和劳动群众决心使中国馆尽早开幕，他们以很大的热情来帮助中国朋友进行工作。在达卡的营造商和建筑工人中，已经惯于用“中国速度”这个术语来形容高速度了。他们决心用“中国速度”来建设中国馆。因此，在他们的帮助下，只用了二十天，一座中国展览馆的宏大的建筑就落成了。
    载运中国展品的船只只能在东巴基斯坦的吉大港停泊，展品必须从那里卸下来，然后用火车运往二百多英里以外的达卡。为了使中国展览馆的展品迅速运出，当载运展品的船只到达港口时，吉大港的工人们连夜卸下展品，铁路当局设法尽快地运送中国的展品。达卡的工人们也连夜卸货，一刻不停地把展品运到中国馆。就这样，中国展览馆终于在达卡顺利地、如期地开幕了。
    在达卡，人们把中国展览馆筹建工作的高速度传为美谈。仅仅在一个月以前，那里还是一片荒地，而在一个月之后，一座富丽堂皇的建筑物就矗立起来了，而且里面陈列着中国人民在过去十年中所创造的美好的珍品。因此，这里的人们用许多美丽的传说赞誉中国展览馆，他们说，中国馆的出现，简直像“天方夜谭”中的神灯的故事一样，它在一瞬间神奇地闪耀在人们的眼前。
    七十五万人次的参观者
    中国展览馆吸引了巴基斯坦人民的极大的兴趣。在中国馆展出的这些日子里，巴基斯坦的观众川流不息地涌向中国馆。还在今年1月的头十天里，当中国展览馆的先遣人员第一次在达卡的街头出现、中国馆的招牌在建筑工地上刚刚竖立起来的时候，人们就急急忙忙地赶来询问展览馆开幕的日期。2月9日下午，当东巴基斯坦省长扎基尔·侯赛因主持中国馆的开幕仪式时，有好几千人聚集在展览馆的外面，他们站立了三小时之久，一直等到展览馆的大门开放。就在开幕那一天的晚上，仅仅在三小时以内，就有二万人参观了中国馆。每逢星期天，中国馆总是要接待四万到五万位观众。
    自从2月底以来，达卡经常下雨，而且占达卡居民的绝大多数的穆斯林正进入斋月。他们在白天不进饮食，通常很少出去。但是，他们仍然成群结队地参观了中国展览馆。到闭幕为止，参观中国馆的人次已经达到七十五万了。
    中国馆的声誉还从达卡流传到东、西巴基斯坦的各个地方，从达卡东南二百多英里的吉大港，从东北部的锡尔赫特市，从米门辛格，人们乘火车、汽车和飞机纷纷赶到达卡来参观中国馆。吉大港的英文报纸“东方考察者报”在那个城市的发行数量通常是七千份。在3月初的一天，这家报纸以两版的地位刊载了介绍中国展览馆以及中国建设的专文，那一天的发行量就猛增到一万二千份。
    在中国展览馆中，很多巴基斯坦人第一次看到了新中国的真正面貌。他们看到了鞍山和上海的钢铁工人所生产的各种压延钢材；看到了上海、无锡、沈阳、齐齐哈尔、大连和昆明的机器制造工人在大跃进中所生产的各种最新式的工作母机；看到了洛阳第一拖拉机厂所生产的“东方红”牌拖拉机。他们还看到了表明中华人民共和国成立以来、特别是1958年大跃进以来国民经济飞跃发展的图表；看到了人民公社的丰富的产品，看到了介绍人民公社公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院、医院和农业中学的照片；看到了上海和杭州纺织工人所制造的色彩鲜艳的丝绸；看到了北京的精巧玲珑的象牙雕刻等等。参观者非常仔细地观看各种制品，很多人一次又一次地反复前往参观。达卡有一位医生，在二十天中就到中国展览馆参观了十六次。
    东巴基斯坦省长侯赛因第一次参观中国馆时，就仔细地观察了农业机器，特别是改良农具和新式农具。在他访问以后，东巴基斯坦农业管理处派遣了一名工程师前往中国展览馆研究改良农具，特别是南京制的插秧机。他详细询问了有关的技术资料。第二天，农业管理处又派了两名技术员到中国馆来绘制这架插秧机的草图。后来，农业管理处再一次派遣三个技术员第三次去研究那些新式农具。
    成群的参观者特别是农民，每天都围在洛阳第一拖拉机厂所生产的“东方红”牌拖拉机和北京农业机械厂的联合收割机的旁边，怀着巨大的兴趣观看这些机器的表演。米门辛格的两位女学生特地从离达卡六十多英里的地方赶来，以两个下午的时间在中国馆描绘了中国刺绣的图样。有一次，中国展览馆的工作人员应参观者的要求，试验了南京“熊猫”牌收音机的录音部分。在表演的时候，很多参观者在录音器前情不自禁地引吭高歌。
    “中国人民的智慧和力量万岁！”
    每天，大量的参观者热烈地同中国馆的工作人员握手，向他们祝贺中国人民取得的成就。达卡的居民一再热烈地说，“中国兄弟正在以巨大的步伐向前迈进。我们巴基斯坦人对此感到非常高兴。”请翻开观众的留言簿看看吧，这里面你能够读到对中国人民社会主义建设事业的热情赞美的语句。一位达卡公民热情地在留言簿上写道：“中华人民共和国在社会主义的历史上写下了难忘的一页。我们从心灵深处向它祝贺。我们向新中国那些进行社会主义建设的英雄们表示敬意。”数以百计的参观者在留言簿上这样热情地写道：“我完全入迷了”，“我被深深地吸引住了”，“展览品是这样美丽、这样可爱、这样精美、这样迷人，甚至我做梦也没想到”。有一些观众还热情地赞扬中国的人民公社，他们说，“人民公社的确出色！”
    多少年来，东方的民族一直是被那些西方的殖民主义者认为落后的、不发达的、没有希望和没有前途的。但是，今天的情况已经根本改观了！有些参观过中国展览馆的巴基斯坦人说，“中国为亚洲挽回了面子。在以前，亚洲受着西方国家的统治，但今天，亚洲已不再害怕他们了。”观众们说：“新中国是不发达国家的一个伟大榜样”，“是亚洲的骄傲”，“中国的成就使我们相信，东方将能够在各个方面同西方竞赛。”的确，所有这些热情的语句，反映了巴基斯坦普通人民的心愿。在留言簿里，几乎每一页都重复地发出这样的呼声：“人民中国万岁！”“中国人民的智慧和力量万岁！”
    深挚的友情，美好的祝愿
    通过中国展览馆在达卡的展出，进一步加深了中国人民和巴基斯坦人民之间的友谊，增进了两国人民之间的相互了解。在这些天里，在中国展览馆里出现了许多动人的场面，充分表达了巴基斯坦人民对于中国人民的深挚的友情。达卡机器修理厂的一个工人在参观中国馆后，同天津第一机床厂的工程师汤心豫交了朋友。他第二天同他的兄弟一起又来看望汤心豫。这位工人带来了一瓶香水，坚持要把香水洒在汤心豫的身上。巴基斯坦妇女在同中国馆的女工作人员谈话时，叫她们的女儿向中国阿姨问好。某些曾在中国馆建筑工地工作过的工人，在中国馆开幕后，要求在展览馆中担任讲解员等工作，并且表示不愿接受任何酬劳。包括达卡大学的学生和西巴基斯坦首府拉合尔的运动员在内的许多巴基斯坦人，都要求同中国展览馆的人员交换地址，以便通信，并且希望得到中国朋友的家庭照片。
    在展览期间，东巴基斯坦的工商界人士也对中国馆表示了极大的兴趣。他们同中国展览代表团进行了很多次接触，商谈两国之间的贸易问题。达卡的巴基斯坦黄麻协会特别邀请了中国展览代表团团长高尚能参加了一次茶会。黄麻协会会长伊斯巴哈尼在会上呼吁扩大巴基斯坦同中国之间的贸易。
    当中国馆快要闭幕的时候，很多参观者留恋不舍。他们热情地向中国展览馆的工作人员说：“希望你们再来访问我们的国家。”一个参观者在留言簿上怀着惜别之意恳切地写道：“我感谢你们不辞辛苦地到我国来，感谢你们使我们有机会看到你们的惊人成就。我们希望你们将来仍不辞辛苦地到这里来。”
    在结束本文的时候，记者愿意引用一个署名为“伊斯兰”的巴基斯坦人在留言簿上写下的对新中国的祝词，它孕育着绵绵的友情和最美好的祝愿。让这些珍贵的诗句飞过山谷河流和原野，同中国人民会面吧：
    “愿你的生命像春天的花朵一样开放；
    愿你的生命像雨季的水波一样地充盈；
    愿你的生命像秋天的名花一样的美丽。”
