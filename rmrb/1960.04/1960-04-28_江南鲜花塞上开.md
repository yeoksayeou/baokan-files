Southern Flowers Bloom in the Frontier

    My niece and her husband were both transferred from Shanghai to work in Yinchuan. When they left, I thought to myself: Young people are fortunate to be able to go to the places the country needs most and put their strength where it's most effective. When will I, this old man, be able to participate in the construction of the Northwest! This time, the factory approved my request to go to Ningxia as a technical advisor, and I was overjoyed. When I saw the factory leaders, I stood up straight and walked with the vigorous strides of a young man, afraid that the leaders would say I was too old and not let me go.

    The day after I arrived in Yinchuan, a comrade from the reception office took me to see my niece. They were surprised and delighted to see me. I said with a smile, "I also have a share in building Ningxia. Don't think I'm old; I'm going to compete with you!" I heard from their factory leaders that they were both doing well in their work. It's truly like southern flowers blooming in the frontier.

    I have worked in ordnance factories, shipyards, and machinery factories, and I know a bit about machining and fitting techniques. This time in Ningxia, I can do whatever is assigned to me and guarantee to do the work well. If I don't do the work well, I won't return to Shanghai.

    江南鲜花塞上开
    我外甥女和外甥女婿都从上海调到银川工作了。他们临走时我心里就想：还是青年人有福气，能到国家最需要的地方去，把力量使在刀刃上，可我这个老头子什么时候能参加西北建设呢！这次，厂子也批准我到宁夏作技术指导，我乐坏了。见到厂里领导时我就把腰板挺得笔直，走步像小伙子一样大步流星，生怕领导说我老，不让我去。
    我到银川第二天，接待室的同志领我去看我的外甥女，她们见到我又惊又喜，我笑着说：“建设宁夏也有我一份啊，你们别看我老了，我还要跟你们比一比呢！”听他们厂里领导上说，她们工作得都不错。这可真是江南的鲜花塞上开了。
    我在兵工厂、造船厂、机械厂工作过，机工、钳工技术都懂得点，这次宁夏，分配我干什么都成，保证把工作搞好，不搞好工作，我不回上海。
