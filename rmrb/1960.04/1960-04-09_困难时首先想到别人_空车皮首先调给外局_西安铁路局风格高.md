Xi'an, April 8th (By our staff reporter) The employees of the Xi'an Railway Bureau, developing a communist style, have put forward the bold slogan of "Thinking of others first in times of difficulty." The more the freight transport tasks increase and the more the vehicles are insufficient, the more they put the needs of the whole country and neighboring bureaus first, preferring to be deficient themselves rather than letting others be short. This spirit has been repeatedly praised and rewarded by the Ministry of Railways.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the freight volume in Shaanxi Province has greatly increased, and the situation in Shanxi and Gansu, which are adjacent to Shaanxi Province, is also the same. Shanxi, which is responsible for supplying coal to the whole country, needs a large number of empty cars, a considerable part of which needs to be supplied by the Xi'an Bureau; while the Lanzhou Bureau, which has a large unloading volume, is an important source for the Xi'an Bureau to obtain empty cars. Under the circumstances that the freight volume of the three provinces is rapidly increasing at the same time, the empty cars needed by the Taiyuan Bureau have increased, the empty cars from the Lanzhou Bureau have decreased, and the Xi'an Bureau itself does not have enough empty cars. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the employees of the Xi'an Railway Bureau developed a communist spirit and solved this contradiction. They put the needs of the whole country and neighboring bureaus in the first place. When drawing up plans, they first arranged the empty car dispatch plan. On the premise of ensuring the empty cars required by the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, they considered the use of empty cars within the bureau's jurisdiction, and regarded the empty car dispatch trains as core trains, fixing the time, route, and train number, and focusing on controlling the operation. When empty cars were very scarce, the bureau's dispatching department collected empty cars from various stations by telephone to complete the day's empty car dispatch plan. The railway bureau also made a special regulation that "if the empty car dispatch plan for the day cannot be completed, it must be made up for the next day."

The Xi'an Railway Bureau's transfer of empty cars to the Taiyuan Bureau not only provided as many as were needed, but also considered the Taiyuan Bureau in many ways, achieving balanced empty car dispatch, providing them when they were needed, and providing the cars they needed. The Xi'an West Station, which organizes the empty car dispatch trains, would not load its own cars before midnight when encountering abnormal traffic flow, and would dispatch empty cars to the north first, sacrificing its own balanced loading and unloading operations in exchange for the balanced use of empty cars by fraternal bureaus.

The employees of the Xi'an Bureau not only considered the difficulties and needs of neighboring bureaus in every way when sending empty cars, but also took the initiative to help fraternal bureaus solve the difficulties in receiving cars. The Party organization and administrative responsible cadres of Tongguan Station visited the Linfen and Fenglingdu stations of the Taiyuan Bureau four times to contact and cooperate and solicit opinions. When they learned that the Fenglingdu Station was unable to complete the vehicle dwell time indicators due to the lack of car coupling opportunities, they repeatedly used the station's shunting locomotives to pull the empty car dispatch trains over and pull the heavy cars there over.

The Xi'an Railway Bureau's communist style won the Excellent Award issued by the Ministry of Railways in this year's National Railway Boundary Cooperation Competition, and Tongguan Station was named a National Red Banner Port.

The Xi'an Railway Bureau's persistence in putting politics in command and advocating the style of putting others before oneself has not only completed the empty car dispatch task and supported neighboring bureaus, but has also created a new situation of a strong political atmosphere and high production enthusiasm within the bureau. In order to solve the problem of the shortage of empty cars, the employees of this bureau have made great efforts to increase backhaul transportation and increase the net load. Although Tongguan Station loaded seventy-seven fewer cars in January and February than planned, it still overfulfilled the station's freight transport plan by 6% due to the vigorous promotion of backhaul transportation and increased net load. The Xi'an Railway Bureau's overall freight transport task has also been completed quite well.

### 困难时首先想到别人　空车皮首先调给外局  西安铁路局风格高

    困难时首先想到别人　空车皮首先调给外局
    西安铁路局风格高
    本报西安8日电　西安铁路局职工发扬共产主义风格，提出“在困难的时候，首先想到别人”的豪迈口号。越是货运任务增加、车辆不足，他们越是把全国和邻局的需要摆在头里，宁可自己欠缺，不让别人不足。他们这种精神连续受到了铁道部的表扬和奖励。
    大跃进以来，陕西省的货运量大大增加，和陕西省为邻的山西和甘肃情况也是如此。担负着向全国供应煤炭任务的山西需要大量的空车，其中相当大的一部分需要由西安局来供应；而卸车量大的兰州局又是西安局取得空车的重要来源之一。在三省货运量同时迅速增长的情况下，太原局需要的空车增多，兰州局来的空车减少，西安局自己的空车也不够用。西安铁路局职工在党委的领导下，发扬了共产主义精神，解决了这个矛盾。他们把全国和邻局的需要放在第一位，在编制计划时先安排排空计划，在保证太原铁路局所需空车的前提下，来考虑本局管区内的空车使用问题，把排空列车作为核心列车，定时、定线、定车次，重点掌握运行。在空车十分欠缺的时候，局调度部门都是通过电话向各车站搜集空车来完成当天的排空计划。铁路局并特别作了“当天排空计划不能完成时，必须于次日补足”的规定。
    西安铁路局向太原局输送空车，不仅作到了要多少给多少，而且多方面为太原局设想，作到均衡排空，什么时候要，什么时候给，需要什么车给什么车。编组排空列车的西安西站，在遇到车流不正常时，都是零时以前自己不装车，有空车先北排，以牺牲自己装卸上的均衡作业，来换得兄弟局的均衡使用空车。
    西安局的职工不仅在送空车时处处考虑到邻局的困难和需要，并且主动去帮助兄弟局解决接车当中的困难。潼关车站的党组织和行政负责干部曾四次访问太原局的临汾、风陵渡等兄弟站，联系协作，征求意见。当了解到风陵渡站由于挂车机会少，车辆停留时间的指标完不成时，就多次用本站的调车机车过段牵引，把排空列车送过去，并把那里的重车拉过来。
    西安铁路局的这种共产主义风格，在今年全国铁路分界口协作竞赛中，获得了铁道部颁发的优胜奖状，潼关站被命名为全国红旗口。
    西安铁路局坚持政治挂帅，提倡先人后己的风格的结果，不仅完成了排空任务，支援了邻局，同时也在局内造成了政治空气浓厚、生产热情高涨的新局面。为了解决空车少的问题，这个局的职工就大抓捎脚运输和提高净载重。潼关车站1、2月份虽然比计划少装了七十七个车，但由于大搞捎脚运输和提高净载重，仍然超额6％完成了本站货运计划。西安铁路局全局的货运任务也完成得相当好。
