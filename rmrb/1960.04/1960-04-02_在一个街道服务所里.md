    In a Street Service Center
    Deng Min
    I went to Erlong Road. I was drawn to a large wooden sign at the entrance of the "Erlong Road Neighborhood Service Center." The large wooden sign had white paint for the background and red paint for the characters, listing rows of "Service Items": sewing and washing clothes and socks, cleaning, repairing sundries, answering and sending telephone calls, purchasing books and newspapers, paying water and electricity bills, handling savings, caring for patients, decorating new homes,.... Virtually everything related to birth, aging, illness, death, clothing, food, housing, transportation, and daily household chores was handled; services were available almost anytime, year-round, day and night.
    Just as I was marveling at it, a red piece of paper was posted from inside the door, the ink still wet, with two large characters: "Haircut." I touched my hair and walked in.
    This was a rectangular room. The front half, outside the counter, had bookshelves, magazine racks, telephones, tables, and several long chairs. The back half, inside the counter, had sewing machines and workbenches. A barber chair was installed on the side of the counter in the middle. The room was full of people, bustling with activity. Some were browsing books and newspapers, some were buying daily necessities, some were asking questions, and some were working.
    A young man was squatting in the corner, fiddling with electrical appliances, with a service member card hanging on his chest. I asked him, "Do you also provide services to non-residents of this street?" The young man said, "We serve everyone, even those from Heilongjiang." What was going on? I couldn't help but squat down and talk to him. The young man's name was Ping Qixiang. He was enthusiastic and talkative and immediately satisfied my curiosity.
    It turned out that in early September of last year, they suddenly received a large package of torn cotton clothes and trousers from a demobilized soldier from a farm in Heilongjiang, asking them to dismantle, wash, and mend them. He said that he had just been transferred to work there and was unfamiliar with the area. He remembered seeing in the newspaper that there was such a service center in Beijing, so he boldly asked for help. The sisters of the service center's sewing and washing groups accepted the task without hesitation. They even pooled together cloth coupons to buy cloth for mending, turning a set of old cotton clothes into something clean, thick, and beautiful. Fearing that the weather in Heilongjiang would turn cold early, they rushed to send it back overnight. Later, the demobilized soldier returned the money and sent a passionate thank-you letter, saying that he had once again experienced that the motherland was truly a warm family, saying that many street service centers had now been established there.
    "Really," the young man said excitedly, "Service centers are developing so fast! There are already more than three thousand such service centers in Beijing. We were one of the first two hundred or so to be established. Our service items used to be only a dozen or so, but in just over a year, they have increased to more than one hundred and twenty. See? We just posted an addition, a haircut."
    I said, "Who is the barber? I'd like to get a haircut." The young man jumped up, his face full of smiles, and led me to the barber chair, busying himself with washing his hands, putting on a mask, wearing a white coat, and putting a white cloth around me. So he was the barber! But the young man said, "I was originally a temporary worker, repairing electrical appliances. I've only been here for half a month. Now I'm also a telephone operator and a handyman. I learn and do everything I can in my spare time." I thought to myself, my head is probably going to become the young man's experiment in enthusiastic service. The young man saw my concern in the mirror and said, "Don't worry, don't worry, I learned barbering skills for a few years when I was a child. I guarantee you'll be satisfied."
    As the young man cut my hair, he chattered incessantly. He said that there were only twenty-two service members in the center, most of whom were housewives, who had now become multi-skilled service members. They were willing to provide more services, accepting all requests and responding to every need. They were willing to do whatever people could think of and propose, in order to free up more time and energy for people to work. It was just a pity that the place was too small to set things up.
    "Take this haircut as an example," the young man said. "Seeing that barber shops are always crowded, our service center has long wanted to do it, but there's no place. A few days ago, we moved the washing machine out to set up a laundry room, and that's how we set up this haircutting stall. But we're different from barber shops. We can also go to people's homes to give haircuts."
    The young man added with confidence, "This place will be the back garden of the Nationalities Palace in the future. We plan to build another row of houses. It has great prospects!"
    Speaking of the laundry room, there is another story behind it: Once, the person in charge of the center, Li Shufang, and a companion were on night duty at the center when a police officer ran in, out of breath, saying that an old woman had fallen and injured herself while walking alone on a street nearby. She had been taken to the hospital, and the doctor said she needed surgery and hospitalization, but a family member had to sign for it. The old woman's mouth was broken, and she couldn't say her address or name. The police officer searched every household on the street, running around for a long time without figuring it out, so he had to entrust the service center. Li Shufang saw that the police officer was sweating profusely and asked him if he had eaten yet. She learned that he was off duty today but had been running around for this matter without eating. She quickly urged the police officer to go home and eat, promising to take care of it herself. Braving the wind and snow of the harsh winter months, she rushed to the hospital. By chance, it turned out to be Grandma Wang from Shanggang No. 1 neighborhood. The old woman was in tears, as if she had seen her own daughter. Li Shufang quickly called the old woman's son and then stayed by the patient's side, comforting and serving her in every way, until the old woman's son arrived to make arrangements together before she went back. After the old woman recovered, she became close to the service center and offered her vacant room, which she had been reluctant to lend out for fear of noise, to the service station as a laundry room...
    At this time, my hair was also cut, and after a close look, the young man's skills were indeed good. But the young man kept apologizing, saying, "We make do with whatever we have, and the equipment is not complete. We couldn't wash and blow-dry your hair, but we will definitely be able to do it next time."
    A haircut costs only ten cents? The young man said, "We are not doing business, we are providing a service. We only charge for the cost. Some service items are free of charge." So where does the service personnel's salary come from? The young man said, "We handle purchasing services for others, and the relevant units give us a handling fee, so we are self-sufficient."
    The young man was busy answering the phone. I was looking at the banners, red flags, big-character posters, and letters of determination hanging all over the walls when a cheerful female voice came from outside the door, shouting, "Comrades, wedding candy, wedding candy,..." A young woman walked in with the voice, tall, with a rosy face, smiling and holding a handful of candies. Several sisters in the back half of the room who were sewing clothes called her "Sister Li" and "Shufang Mei," vying to ask, "Did Little Xu, the groom, give it?" Li Shufang said, "That's right, that's right, everyone come and eat it." As she spoke, she scattered the candies on the counter and greeted acquaintances, asking what they needed.
    Who was Little Xu, the groom? It turned out to be Xu Xiangying, the household registration police officer from the Erlong Road Police Station. Yesterday, when he brought clothes to be washed, Li Shufang routinely asked him if there was anything else they could do for him. Little Xu paused and said with a red face, "I'm getting married tonight. If you have time, help me do some preparations, so I don't have to ask for leave." Li Shufang repeatedly agreed, "Of course, of course, go to work. Hey, why didn't you say so earlier? We have decorating new homes as one of our services!" Li Shufang and a companion immediately went to Little Xu's dormitory to see what needed to be done or bought, and took care of everything, and cleaned and decorated the room. Women were naturally good at doing this kind of thing, and they also loved this Little Xu, so they put in extra effort. When the groom came back from work and pushed open the door, he didn't even recognize his own room. ...
    While everyone was happily eating wedding candy, a person with a worried face ran in and said to Li Shufang, "My wife is sick, and there's no one at home. I have to go to work. Can you help me take care of her?" Li Shufang quickly said, "Sure, sure, leave it to us. Don't you live at 4 Houjingji Road? We'll go there right away." While comforting him, she saw him out and said, "Comrade Hu Shouzhi, we rarely took the initiative to go to your house to ask what you needed. We will definitely go more often in the future."
    However, most of the service members were out serving others and would not be back for a while. The two or three who remained in the room had not had lunch yet, even though it was already past one o'clock in the afternoon. Li Shufang, dispatching manpower, felt embarrassed. At this time, I couldn't stand by and volunteered to help, saying, "I'll help you take care of things here. I'm off work today and have nothing to do." So, I was approved to serve as a temporary service member and stayed in the center with the young man, letting them all leave.
    In just a few hours, people came and went in a constant stream, keeping the two of us very busy. The young man said that they used to have an average of five hundred people coming to the center a day, but now it's probably even more than that.
    I bid farewell and left around dusk. Walking along the road, I looked back at this ordinary bungalow and, whether it was an illusion or a real feeling, found that it was radiant and dazzling. Maybe the lights were on? Yes, they were on, but wasn't it precisely because the communist ideology and style were universally taking root and growing strong in people's hearts that this brilliance seemed so extraordinarily magnificent!

    在一个街道服务所里
    邓敏
    我到二龙路去。我被“二龙路邻里服务所”门口的一块大木牌吸引住了。大木牌白漆的底，红漆的字，开列着一排一排“服务项目”：缝洗衣袜、打扫卫生、修理杂物、接送电话、代购书报、代交水电费、代办储蓄、看护病人、布置新房、……。举凡生老病死、衣食住行、日常家务，几乎无一不办；一年四季，一天到晚，差不多随时可以服务。
    正看得惊奇，门里又贴出一张红纸条，墨迹未干，写着两个大字“理发”。我摸摸头发，就闯进门去。
    这是一个长方形的大房间，前半间柜台外放着书架、杂志架、电话机、桌子和几张长椅子，后半间柜台里放着缝纫机、工作台，中间柜台侧面安着一把理发椅子。满屋子是人，熙熙攘攘，有在翻阅浏览书报的，有在买日用品的，有在询问什么的，有在工作着的。
    一个小伙子蹲在屋角里摆弄电器东西，胸前挂着服务员证。我问他：“不是本街居民，你们也给服务吗？”小伙子说：“都服务，连黑龙江来的也服务。”这是怎么回事？我不由得也蹲下去，和他谈起来。小伙子名叫平启祥，热情而且健谈，立刻满足了我的好奇心。
    事情是这样的：去年9月初，他们忽然接到黑龙江某农场一位转业军人寄来的一大包破棉衣裤，要他们拆洗缝补，说是才调到那边工作，人地生疏，记得报上登过北京有这末一个服务所，所以冒昧请求帮助。服务所的缝补组和洗衣组的姐妹们毫不犹豫地接受了这项委托，还凑出布票给他买布缝补，把一套破旧棉衣翻得又干净又厚实又美观，怕黑龙江天气冷得早，连夜赶出寄回去了。后来转业军人寄还了钱，捎来一封热情洋溢的感谢信，说他又一次体验到祖国真是名副其实的温暖大家庭，说如今那边也办起了许多街道服务所了。
    “真的，”小伙子兴高采烈地说：“服务所的发展真快呀！咱们北京市已经有三千多个这样的服务所了。我们是最早成立的二百多个当中的一个。我们的服务项目，原先不过十几项，才一年多，增加到一百二十多项了。这不？才又贴出去增加了一项理发。”
    我说：“谁是理发员？我理一理发。”小伙子霍地一跃而起，满面春风把我送到理发椅上坐定，忙着去洗手、戴口罩，穿白罩衣，又拿来白罩布给我围上。敢情他就是理发员呀！可是小伙子说：“我原是个临时工，修理电器的，才来这里半个多月，如今又是电话接送员，又是打杂员，有空什么都学什么都做。”我心想，我这头八成要变成小伙子热心服务的试验品了。小伙子从镜子里看出我的耽忧，连说：“放心放心，我小时学过几年理发手艺，保您满意。”
    小伙子一面理发，一面叨叨不绝。他说所里才二十二个服务员，绝大多数是家庭妇女，现在都成了多面手的服务员了。她们愿意服务得更多，来者不拒，有求必应，只要人们想得到的，提出来的，她们都愿做，为的是叫人们可以腾出更多的时间和精力去工作。只可惜地方太窄，摆设不开。
    “就说这理发吧，”小伙子举例道：“看见理发店总是挤，我们服务所也早想带着做了，就是没地方，前两天把洗衣机搬了出去成立了洗衣房，这才摆下了理发这一摊。不过我们和理发店不同，我们还可以上门理发。”
    小伙子充满信心地补了一句：“这地方以后是民族宫的后花园，我们计划另盖一溜房子，很有发展前途！”
    说起洗衣房，这里面又有一段故事：有一次所里负责人李淑芳和一个同伴正在所里值夜班，忽然一位民警气喘喘地跑进来，说有位老太太独自在这附近街上走着摔伤了，已送到医院，医生说要做缝合手术，要住院，但要家属前去签字。老太太嘴跌破了，说不清自己的住处和姓名，民警就满街挨户查访，跑了半天没摸清，只好来委托服务所。李淑芳看民警累得满头淌汗，一问，才知道他今天休息，却为这事跑得还没吃饭呢。她连忙催民警放心回家吃饭，自己一口应承，要办好这事。她冒着严冬腊月的风雪，一口气赶到医院。一看，真巧，原来是邻近上岗一号的汪老太太。老人家热泪纵横，如见自己女儿。李淑芳赶忙打电话通知了老人家的儿子，之后就寸步不离守着病人，百般安慰、侍奉，直到老人家儿子来了共同安排好后才回去。老太太病好以后，就跟服务所交上了心，把家里久已空着因怕吵闹而不肯出借的一间空屋让给了服务站做洗衣房。……
    这时候，我的头发也理好了，一端详，果然小伙子手艺不错。小伙子却不住抱歉说：“我们因陋就简，设备不全，没能给你洗头吹风，下次来一定可以办到。”
    理一个发才一角钱？小伙子说：“我们不是营业，是服务，只收成本。有些服务项目根本不收钱。”那么服务人员的薪金哪里来呢？小伙子说：“我们办理代购业务，有关单位就给我们手续费，我们就自给自足了。”
    小伙子忙着接电话去了。我正看着四壁满挂着的锦标、红旗、大字报、决心书，忽然门外传进一个欢乐的女声嚷着：“同志们，喜糖，喜糖，……”随着声音走进来一个年青妇女，高高的身材，红喷喷的脸，笑嘻嘻地捧着一捧糖果。后半间几个正在缝补衣裳的姐妹纷纷叫她“李大姐”“淑芳妹”，抢着问：“是小徐新郎给的吧？”李淑芳说：“正是，正是，都来吃吧。”说着把糖果撒在柜台上，就跟熟人们打招呼询问要办什么事。
    小徐新郎又是谁呢？原来是二龙路派出所的户籍警徐向英。昨天他拿衣服来洗时，李淑芳照例关心地问还有什么事要他们办：小徐停了一下，红着脸说了：“我今晚结婚，如果你们有空，帮我做些准备工作，我就不用请假了。”李淑芳连连答应：“可以可以，你上班去吧。嗨，你咋不早说，布置新房，我们早就有这一项嘛！”李淑芳带着一个同伴立刻赶到小徐宿舍察看还有什么需要做的、买的，一应办齐，又把房间打扫干净，布置一新。妇女们做这种事本来拿手，又加她们爱戴这位小徐，所以特别匠心经营。新郎下班回来一推门，都不认得这就是自己的房间了。……
    大伙正喜气洋洋吃喜糖，却有一个人愁容满面跑进来找李淑芳说：“我爱人病了，家里没人，我要上班，能不能请你们帮忙照看一下？”李淑芳忙说：“行行，交给我们吧，你不是住后京畿道四号吗？这就去。”她一面安慰他，一面送他出门，还说：“胡受之同志，我们过去很少主动上你家去问问要办什么事，今后一定多去。”
    可是，大半服务员正在外面服务，一时回不来，屋里剩下的二、三位，已经下午一点多钟了，还没顾上吃中饭呢。李淑芳调派着人手，感到为难。这时候我闲不住了，自告奋勇说：“我帮你们照顾这里，我今天休息没事。”于是，我被批准充当一名临时服务员，和小伙子两人留守所里，让她们都走了。
    只不过个把钟头，人来人往，川流不息，把我们两个忙得不亦乐乎。小伙子说，以前统计过平均一天有五百人次来所，现在恐怕还不止。
    我到黄昏时候才告辞出来。走了一段路，回看这幢普通的平房，不知是幻觉还是实感，发现它光芒四射，辉煌夺目。也许是灯亮了？是的，亮了，但这不正是因为共产主义的思想风格在人的心灵深处普遍生根壮大而显得这光彩格外奇异瑰丽么！
