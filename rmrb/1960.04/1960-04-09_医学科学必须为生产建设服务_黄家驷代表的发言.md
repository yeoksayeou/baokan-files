Comrade Representatives:
    I fully endorse the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
    In 1959, China achieved tremendous successes in industrial and agricultural construction, as well as in cultural, scientific, and technological fields. Similarly, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, and especially after the call for opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, our medical science work made even greater and better achievements than in 1958.
    First and foremost, we adhered to the principle of serving production and construction in medical science research. Work was carried out addressing the main problems existing in production and construction. As everyone knows, parasitic diseases, especially schistosomiasis, are extremely harmful to people's health and agricultural production in the southern provinces of our country. We have always regarded this as one of the key research areas, adopting a policy of combining prevention and treatment, and have thus achieved the latest advancements in epidemiology and treatment methods. The nationwide adoption of the three-day short-course antimonial therapy for schistosomiasis, replacing the twenty to twenty-nine day therapy used in other countries around the world, resolved the conflict between treatment and production. As a result, over three million people were treated in the past year alone, with an average effectiveness rate of 70%. With repeated treatments, a cure is of course possible. In particular, dwarfism can be treated to continue growth and development, infertile women can become pregnant, and cirrhosis can be recovered through treatment. What is even more worth mentioning is that for patients with advanced schistosomiasis, the integrated treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine has brought many people back from the brink of death to the labor front. The achievements in the research and prevention of schistosomiasis are equivalent to providing the agricultural front with millions of laborers, greatly promoting agricultural production.
    The prevention and research of natural focal diseases, which are of great significance to economic construction and national defense, although established not long ago in our country, have already achieved great results. A preliminary survey of the distribution of natural foci has been conducted, and the situation of natural focal diseases in some important economic construction areas has been clarified. According to the principle of prevention and treatment while surveying, prevention and treatment have been carried out for various natural focal diseases, ensuring the health of the working people and the progress of economic construction, and several measures for eradicating natural foci have been studied.
    With the high-speed development of industrial construction, protecting workers' health and changing workers' working conditions have become the most important issues for the medical science community. Since 1959, in terms of dust prevention, factories and mines have universally promoted the seven comprehensive measures of water (wet operations), wind (ventilation), sealing (enclosure), management (strengthening management), inspection (inspection and repair), prevention (personal protection), and sweeping (hygienic cleaning). More than two hundred larger factories and mines across the country have reduced the concentration of dust in the air to below two milligrams per cubic meter. In terms of cooling and heatstroke prevention, large-scale, organized, and planned on-site measurements of meteorological conditions in high-temperature operation factories in different regions of the north and south were conducted through 326 factories in eighteen provinces and cities across the country, along with a health survey of the occurrence of heatstroke among workers. Physiological measurements and physical examinations were performed on 10,000 workers, providing scientific basis for the revision of meteorological conditions and health standards in high-temperature workshops in our country, and for research directions. In terms of preventing poisoning, a relatively complete set of experiences has been gained in the prevention of lead poisoning in the printing industry. Regarding the prevention of benzene poisoning, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Dalian and other cities have successively conducted investigations in paint factories, benzene distillation, 666, DDT and other manufacturing industries, designed and improved ventilation and exhaust equipment, so that the concentration of benzene vapor in the air is far below the national standards, thereby ensuring the health of workers in lead and benzene operations.
    The rural people's communes throughout the country have brought new topics to the medical science community. This is the issue of pest elimination and disease prevention and health work construction in rural people's communes. Taking the pilot project of the Academy of Medical Sciences in Anguo County, Hebei Province as an example, they summarized and absorbed the experience of the local masses, adopted methods such as organizing professional manure collection teams, establishing manure treatment plants, and mud-sealed composting, strengthening manure management, which not only reduced the fly index and the most common intestinal infectious diseases in rural areas, but also improved fertilizer efficiency. Through one year of work, a set of experience in health work of people's communes has been initially explored, and many effective measures have been proposed in accordance with local conditions. The National Rural Health Work On-site Conference held in Jishan County, Shanxi Province in November last year further promoted rural health work. In 1959, a survey of nutritional status was also conducted in twenty-four provinces and autonomous regions, and two municipalities directly under the central government, including 177 cities and counties, and areas of 14 ethnic groups, completing the work that was originally scheduled to be completed in ten years, and initially grasping the nutritional status of people in major regions of our country (including plains, mountains, deserts, plateaus, fishing, pastoral, forestry, mining areas, etc.). It created extremely important conditions for planned improvement of people's nutrition and health.
    Under the leadership of the Party, after breaking superstitions and emancipating their minds, our medical scientists are determined to make great achievements in conquering serious diseases that endanger people's health, such as tumors, hypertension, heart disease, burns, etc., and have carried out large-scale comprehensive research from the aspects of general survey, treatment, experiment and drugs, and have achieved significant results.
    Since the medical community put forward the bold slogan of "making hypertension bow its head," in the past year or so, the blood pressure of more than 730,000 people has been surveyed in urban and rural residents and staff of various occupations. The results of the survey proved that different regions, different ages, and different occupations have a significant relationship with the incidence rate. The survey of incidence rate is of great significance for understanding the etiology and incidence rate of hypertension in our country, and for determining the normal range of blood pressure. In terms of the principle of pathogenesis, it was found that the neurological state of hypertensive patients is often unbalanced, and animal experiments have also found that super-stimulation of nerves can lead to hypertension. It has been preliminarily confirmed that mental and neurological factors play a major role in the etiology and pathogenesis of hypertension, which is of great significance for solving the treatment and prevention of hypertension, and for the development of physiology of the nervous system and blood circulation system. In terms of antihypertensive drugs, a new antihypertensive drug "Jiangyaling" has been developed. It has higher efficacy and fewer side effects than similar imported drugs in the past, and has been considered a relatively good antihypertensive drug at present.
    In the research work of tumors, the method of large-scale general survey to find the cause, study the pathogenesis, and efficient treatment methods is also adopted at the same time. According to the data of thirteen provinces and cities, a general survey of more than 4 million people has been carried out. Through the general survey, not only the incidence rate of major tumors in our country is initially provided, so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in time, but also rich information is provided for elucidating the pathogenic factors and pathogenesis. For example, the relationship between the incidence of esophageal cancer and gender, the relationship with family history, and the relationship with dietary habits; for example, the relationship between cervical cancer and the age of first birth, and the relationship with cervical erosion, etc., all provide some new information. New achievements have also been made in experimental research on tumors, research on anti-cancer drugs, and research on surgery and radiation therapy. Our medical science workers have the ambition to conquer tumors.
    Due to the rapid development of cardiac surgery, many heart disease patients have been treated. In 1958, only a very few hospitals in our country could perform intracardiac surgery of mitral valve commissurotomy. In 1959, not only more than 60 hospitals could perform this kind of surgery, but also some hospitals in Xi'an, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing and other places have been able to perform direct vision intracardiac surgery with hypothermic anesthesia and self-made artificial heart-lung machines. Using artificial heart-lung machines can repair various lesions in the heart. In Shanghai and Beijing, it has been successfully applied to the complex tetralogy of Fallot, which contains four malformations. Our country has already manufactured five types of artificial heart-lung machines, and the technology has reached the international level.
    Since the rescue of steel worker Qiu Cai Kang in 1958 set a brilliant example, the number of cases of large-area burns that have been cured has been increasing, not only accumulating rich clinical experience and sorting them into sets, but also improving the theoretical level. In terms of emergency treatment of burn shock, clinical experience has proved that separate infusion of dextran made in our country, or dextran as the main ingredient, combined with an appropriate amount of whole blood or plasma can achieve effective prevention and treatment. Toxemia and sepsis are extremely serious problems in large-area burns. In our country, the use of Chinese medicine mung bean and licorice soup for internal administration and purple gromwell ointment for external application has achieved good results in the treatment of toxemia, and it has been preliminarily proved that these two drugs have analgesic, detoxifying and antibacterial effects. For sepsis, we have discovered its early signs, so that we can treat it early and cure diseases that were previously considered incurable.
    Using modern methods to study and organize traditional Chinese medicine, implementing the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and creating a new school of medicine in our country is the established policy of the Party and the glorious task of medical science workers. Good progress has been made in 1959. The many impressive academic papers at the National Academic Symposium on Acupuncture and Meridians of Traditional Chinese Medicine held in Shanghai in July last year have proved this point. A large amount of material shows that the integrated treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine can find effective therapies for some difficult and complicated diseases. Multi-occurring diseases can also be treated in a faster, better and more economical way. Aplastic anemia, which has always been considered incurable, has an effective rate of 69.8% through integrated treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. In addition, acupuncture anesthesia can be used for surgery without anesthetics, acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine can be used to treat appendicitis, and traditional Chinese medicine can be used to treat biliary ascariasis, etc., which can exempt more than 90% of patients from surgery. Preliminary results have also been obtained in using modern methods to study the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. In animal experiments, it has been basically confirmed that acupuncture at a certain acupoint has a certain impact on the physiological function of the related viscera of the body. This provides important clues for the research of meridians and viscera theories.
    In the research of drugs and antibiotics, in the past year, not only have new products been searched for and trial-produced in combination with clinical needs, but also the entire set of technological production processes has been studied facing production. In 1959, more than 200 kinds of drugs produced in our country were successfully researched and trial-produced last year, including the widely used Jiangyaling, ergotamine commonly used in obstetrics, and the expensive steroid hormone cortisone. The success of these studies has great significance economically and politically. This year, the general survey, introduction and cultivation of medicinal plants were widely carried out throughout the country, and many new varieties were discovered. On the basis of a nationwide survey, regional Chinese medicine manuals, Chinese medicine records, and medicinal plant manuals were compiled. In terms of antibiotics, the fermentation units of the original antibiotics have been continuously improved, and erythromycin, neomycin, and oxytetracycline have all been put into production.
    Under the guidance of the Party's policy of walking on two legs, in this year, medical scientific research not only blossomed everywhere, but also successively established cutting-edge science, and established sciences that were originally blank in our country. For example, radiological medicine has been widely developed in dozens of large and medium-sized cities across the country for research and clinical application, specialized technical cadres have been trained, radioactive isotopes have been applied to experimental research and clinical diagnosis and treatment, and some valuable achievements have been obtained. In terms of radiation protection, research has been carried out on how to increase the body's resistance to radiation, reduce the body's sensitivity to radiation, foods that can reduce radiation damage, radiation "immunity", and chemical protection. Achievements have also been made in the application of tracer atoms. We not only attach importance to solving major practical problems at present, but also attach importance to the research of basic theory. Research has been carried out on pathological morphology, pathological physiology, embryology, biochemistry, etc., around key research projects. Biophysics and medical biology departments have been gradually established.
    The facts of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959 once again proved that continuously strengthening the leadership of the Party and conscientiously implementing the Party's general line for building socialism are the fundamental guarantees for the high-speed development and victory of medical science. In the past year, in the field of medical scientific research, we have adhered to putting politics in command, implementing the policy of serving production and health work, opposing the erroneous tendency of being divorced from production and reality, continuing the struggle between the two roads, constantly breaking superstitions, emancipating our minds, adopting the policy of walking on two legs of combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, combining indigenous and foreign methods, combining popularization and improvement, and combining theory and practice, vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, and vigorously carrying out mass movements, so that science and technology are combined with the broad masses, and under overall planning, dividing responsibilities, vigorously promoting the style of cooperation, and thus achieving great achievements.
    In the year of a greater leap forward in 1960, medical scientific research work must advance bravely at a higher speed. Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" pointed out that "the arrangement of the National Economic Plan for 1960" should further determine that agriculture is the foundation and industry is the leading factor. At present, rural health work is booming. To ensure that every people's commune has a health center, every production brigade has a health station, and every production team has a health worker, our medical workers must go deep into the countryside and contribute their strength to the completion of this major task.
    Comrades, let us hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, set high ambitions, make up our minds, go all out, aim high, and basically realize the original twelve-year medical science development plan ahead of schedule in the next three years, so that our country can enter the world's advanced ranks of medicine during the Third Five-Year Plan. Climb the peak of medical science!

专栏：

    医学科学必须为生产建设服务
    黄家驷代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理所作的各项报告和人民代表大会常委会工作报告。
    1959年我国在工农业建设和文化科学技术上取得了巨大成就。我们医学科学工作，也同样在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，尤其是在党的八届八中全会号召反右倾、鼓干劲以后，作出了比1958年更多更大更好的成就。
    首先，在医学科学研究工作中坚持了为生产建设服务的方针。针对生产建设中存在的主要问题开展了工作。大家知道，寄生虫病，尤其是血吸虫病，在我国南方各省对人民健康、对农业生产危害极大，我们一直将此作为研究重点之一，采取了防病与治病相结合的方针，因而在流行病学上和治疗方法上都取得了最新的成就。全国采用三天的短程锑剂疗法治疗了血吸虫病，代替了世界各国沿用的二十天至二十九天疗法，解决了治病和生产的矛盾，因而在去年一年内治疗了三百多万人，有效率平均达70％，再经反复治疗，当然是可以治愈的，尤其对侏儒症，经过治疗即继续生长发育，不孕的妇女又能怀孕，肝硬化经治疗也得以恢复。更值得提出的是对晚期血吸虫病人，经中西医综合治疗后，使不少人从死亡边缘回到了劳动战线。血吸虫病的研究和防治的成就，等于向农业战线输送了上百万的劳动力，大大促进了农业生产。
    对经济建设和国防均有重要意义的自然疫源地疾病的防治和研究，在我国虽然建立不久，但已取得很大成绩。初步调查了自然疫源地的分布，弄清了一些重要的经济建设区的自然疫源性疾病的情况。根据边调查边防治的原则，为各种自然疫源性疾病进行了防治，保证了劳动人民的健康和经济建设的进行，并研究出若干拨除自然疫源地的措施。
    随着工业建设的高速度发展，保护工人健康，改变工人劳动条件，成了医学科学界头等重要的问题。1959年以来，在防尘方面，各厂矿普遍推广了水（湿式作业）、风（通风）、密（密闭）、管（加强管理）、查（检查检修）、防（个人防护）、扫
  （卫生清洁）等七大综合措施，全国已有二百多个较大的厂矿将空气中粉尘浓度降至每立方米二毫克以下。在降温防暑方面，通过全国十八个省市三百二十六个工厂大规模、有组织、有计划的关于南北不同地区高温作业工厂的气象条件的现场测定，和工人中暑发生情况的卫生调查，并对一万名工人作了生理测定和体格检查，为我国高温车间气象条件、卫生标准的修订和研究方向提供了科学依据。在预防中毒方面，预防铅中毒已在印刷业中获得了较完整的一套经验。对苯中毒预防方面，上海、天津、北京、旅大等市先后在喷漆厂、苯蒸馏、六六六、DDT等制造工业中作了调查，设计并改善了通风排气设备，使空气中苯蒸气的浓度大大低于国家标准，从而保证了铅苯作业工人的健康。
    全国农村人民公社化，给医学科学界带来了新课题。这就是农村人民公社的除害灭病和卫生工作建设问题。以医学科学院在河北安国县的试点为例，他们总结并吸取了当地群众的经验，采取组织专业积肥队，建立粪便处理场、泥封堆肥等办法，加强了粪便管理，不但使苍蝇指数和农村最普遍的肠道传染病减少，并提高了肥效。通过一年的工作，已经初步摸索出一套人民公社卫生工作经验，因地制宜地提出了许多有效措施。去年11月在山西省稷山县召开的全国农村卫生工作现场会议更促进了农村的卫生工作。1959年还在全国二十四个省和自治区、二个直辖市，包括一百七十七个市县、十四个民族的地区，进行了营养状况的调查，完成了原订十年才能完成的工作，初步掌握了我国各主要地区（包括平原、山区、沙漠、高原、渔、牧、林、矿区等）人民的营养状况。对有计划地改善人民营养卫生创造了极重要的条件。
    我国的医学科学家，在党的领导下，经过破除迷信，解放思想，决心立大志征服危害人民健康的严重疾病，如肿瘤、高血压、心脏病、烧伤等，从普查、治疗、实验以及药物方面，进行了较大规模的综合性研究，获得了显著成绩。
    自从医学界提出了“要高血压低头”的豪迈口号以后，一年多来即在城乡居民、和各种不同职业的工作人员中普查了七十三万多人的血压，普查结果证明不同地区，不同年龄以及不同职业对发病率都有重大关系。发病率的调查对于了解我国高血压的病因学、发病率，确定血压正常范围等有重要意义。在发病原理方面，发现高血压患者神经状态多不平衡，动物实验亦发现对神经的超强刺激可导致高血压，已初步肯定精神神经因素在高血压病因及发病机制中的主要作用，这对解决高血压的治疗、预防，对发展神经系统和血循环系统生理学方面都具有重大意义。在降压药物方面，已制成新降压药“降压灵”。比过去进口的同类药物疗效高，副作用小，已被认为是目前较为良好的降压药物。
    在肿瘤的研究工作中，也同样采取了大量普查以寻找病因、研究发病原理和高效治疗方法同时并进的方法。根据十三个省、市的资料，已进行四百余万人的普查。通过普查，不仅初步提供了我国主要肿瘤的发病率，使患者得以早期诊断和及时治疗，并且对阐明发病因素和发病原理提供了丰富资料。如食管癌的发病与性别的关系，与家族病史的关系，与饮食习惯的关系；如子宫颈癌与初产年龄的关系，与宫颈糜烂的关系等，都提供了一些新的资料。在肿瘤的实验研究、抗癌药物研究、手术及放射治疗研究方面也作出了新成绩。我们医学科学工作者有实现制服肿瘤的雄心壮志。
    由于心脏外科的迅速发展，许多心脏病患者得到了治疗。1958年我国还只有极少数医院仅仅能作二尖瓣交界分离的心内手术，而1959年不仅有六十个以上的医院能作这种手术，而且在西安、上海、天津、北京等一些医院已经能用低温麻醉和自制的人工心肺机进行心内直视手术。利用人工心肺机可以修补心内各种病变，在上海、北京曾应用于包含四种畸形的复杂的法洛氏四联症获得成功。我国已经制出五种型式的人工心肺机，技术上已经达到了国际水平。
    自1958年抢救钢铁工人丘财康树立了光辉的范例以来，大面积烧伤获得治愈的病例日益增多，不仅积累了丰富的临床经验，整理成套，同时也提高了理论水平。在烧伤休克的急救方面，临床经验证明单独输入我国自制的右旋糖酐，或以右旋糖酐为主，配合适量全血或血浆可以获得有效防治。毒血症和败血症是大面积烧伤中的极严重的问题，我国用中药绿豆、甘草汤内服和紫草膏外敷治疗毒血症获得良好功效，并初步证明这两种药有镇痛解毒和抗菌作用。对于败血症，我们发现了它的早期征兆，从而得以提早治疗、治好过去认为不治之症。
    采用现代方法研究整理祖国医学，实行中西医结合，创立我国新医药学派，是党的既定方针，也是医学科学工作者的光荣任务。1959年已经取得良好进展。去年7月在上海召开的全国中医经络针灸学术座谈会上的许多蔚然可观的学术论文，已经证明了这一点。大量的材料说明了中西医综合治疗，可以使一些疑难病症找到有效的疗法。对多发病亦可得到多快好省的治疗。一向被认为不治之症的再生障碍性贫血，通过中西医综合治疗，有效率达69.8％。此外，用针灸麻醉可以不用麻醉药进行手术，针灸和中药治疗阑尾炎，中药治疗胆道蛔虫病等都可使90％以上病人免于外科手术。在用现代方法研究祖国医学理论方面也已获初步成果。在动物实验上，已基本上肯定了针刺某一经穴对机体的相关脏腑的生理作用有一定的影响。这对经络、脏腑学说的研究提供了重要线索。
    在药物和抗菌素的研究上，一年来不但结合临床需要，寻找和试制新产品，而且面向生产，研究了整套的工艺生产过程。1959年我国生产的药品，有二百多种是去年研究和试制成功的，其中包括应用广泛的降压灵、产科常用的麦角新碱、价值昂贵的甾体激素考地松。这些研究的成功，在经济上、政治上均有很大的意义。这一年，全国各地广泛进行了药用植物的普查、引种和栽培工作，发现了许多新品种。在全国普查基础上，编写了地区性的中药手册、中药志和药用植物手册。在抗菌素方面，原有的抗菌素不断提高发酵单位，红霉素、新霉素、土霉素均已投入生产。
    在党的两条腿走路的方针指导下，在这一年中医学科学研究不仅普遍开花，而且相继建立了尖端科学，建立了原来在我国还是空白的科学。如放射医学，已在全国数十个大、中城市广泛展开研究和临床应用，培养了专门技术干部，将放射性同位素应用于实验研究和临床诊断治疗，且获得了一些有价值的成就。在放射防护方面，对如何增加机体对射线的抗力，降低机体对射线的敏感度，可以减轻射线损伤的食品，射线“免疫”，以及化学防护等方面进行了研究。在示踪原子的应用上也取得了成绩。我们不仅重视了当前重大实际问题的解决，也重视了基础理论的研究。对病理形态学、病理生理学、胚胎学、生物化学等方面，都围绕重点研究项目进行了研究。生物物理和医学生物学等部门已逐步建立。
    1958年大跃进和1959年继续大跃进的事实，又一次证明了不断加强党的领导，认真贯彻党的建设社会主义的总路线，是医学科学高速度发展和取得胜利的根本保证。一年来，在医学科学研究方面，我们坚持政治挂帅，贯彻为生产、为卫生工作服务的方针，反对脱离生产、脱离实际的错误倾向，继续进行两条道路的斗争，不断破除迷信、解放思想，采取中西结合、土洋并举，普及与提高、理论与实践相结合的两条腿走路的方针，大闹技术革新和技术革命，大搞群众运动，使科学技术与广大群众相结合，在全面规划下分工负责，大兴协作之风，因而获得了巨大的成就。
    在1960年更大跃进的一年，医学科学研究工作必须以更高的速度奋勇前进。李富春副总理的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”中指出：“1960年国民经济计划”的安排，应当进一步地确定以农业为基础，以工业为主导。目前农村卫生工作正在蓬勃发展，要使个个人民公社有卫生院，个个生产大队有卫生所，个个生产队有卫生员，我们医务工作者必须深入农村，为完成这一重大任务贡献出自己的力量。
    同志们，让我们高举毛泽东思想红旗，立大志，下决心，鼓足干劲，力争上游，在今后三年内基本上提前实现原订的十二年医学科学发展规划，使我国在第三个五年计划期间进入世界医学先进行列。攀登医学科学高峰！
