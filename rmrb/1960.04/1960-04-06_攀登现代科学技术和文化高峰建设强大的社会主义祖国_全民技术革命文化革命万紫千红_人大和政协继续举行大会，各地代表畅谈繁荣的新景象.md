Xinhua News Agency, April 5th. The Second Session of the Second National People's Congress continued to hold general meetings in two venues today. Representatives from all fronts spoke freely about the flourishing scenes emerging from the technical revolution and cultural revolution movements in various regions. A large number of facts presented at the meeting showed that the great revolution of our people to comprehensively change the backwardness of technology and culture is unfolding vigorously and extensively.

Huang Yan, Governor of Anhui Province, used a large number of facts in his speech to vividly illustrate the enormous power of the technical innovation and technical revolution movements. In this province, due to the development of a mass technical innovation movement, production on all fronts has rapidly developed and a large amount of labor has been saved. On the agricultural front, the province has promoted the use of more than 47 million pieces of new and improved agricultural tools from January of last year to March of this year. In the past year alone, the province saved 2 billion labor workdays. During the water control project last winter and this spring, due to the widespread use of improved tools and semi-mechanized tools, the efficiency per person per day could be equivalent to fourteen people when the Huai River control project began in 1950. The industrial and transportation sectors of the province newly built and expanded 1,221 projects last year, with a total output value increase of 55%, but due to the development of the technical innovation movement, the labor force used was reduced by more than 360,000 people compared with 1958. From January to March this year, factories and mining enterprises across the province saved more than 90,000 people in technical innovation, achieving increased production without increasing manpower. Wang Bingxiang, Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that the technical innovation movement has also developed into a massive mass movement in Gansu. In Lanzhou alone, more than 4,100 major reforms were implemented in two and a half months, and more than 400 assembly lines, production linkage lines, and automatic and semi-automatic lines appeared in the city. In many places, employees, with the spirit of "doing" first and "skill" paving the way, boldly innovated, achieving increased production without increasing manpower, with one person doing the work of several. Qiu Xinye, First Secretary of the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, talked about the innovative achievements of coal mine workers. Coal miners in Fuxin created the coal hucking machine for the first time in the innovation movement, allowing coal hucking workers to discard the large iron shovels they had used for generations. This creation opened the treasure trove of wisdom of the vast number of employees like a key, and all workers in the mine, from those in major jobs such as coal mining and tunneling, to cooks, childcare workers, odd-job workers, and employees' family members, were involved in the torrent of the technical revolution. Qiu Xinye said that as of March 10, Fuxin City had created 752 pieces of machinery, and the degree of mechanization of direct work in the entire Fuxin Coal Mine had reached 85%, freeing more than 7,000 people from heavy physical labor and manual operations, and the output and efficiency of many coal mining work surfaces had increased by two or three times.

Liu Jianxi, Chief Engineer of the Guiyang Railway Bureau, representing the transportation front, said that railway construction in Guizhou is accelerating since the Qian-Gui Railway was opened to Guiyang last year. Now the construction of the Sichuan-Guizhou, Yunnan-Guizhou, and Hunan-Guizhou railways is also being stepped up, and many branch lines and special lines for factories and mines are being built in batches, and a new railway network is emerging before the people. He said that we are determined to continue to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, and strive to build railways in the mountainous areas of Guizhou in all directions as soon as possible. Li Xikui, Deputy Director of the Transportation Department of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, and two other representatives, Sun Xiaoju and Zheng Xikun, jointly introduced the situation of their collaboration between the Shenyang Railway Bureau and fraternal enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Fushun, and Dalian Port, as well as local service industries, to organize passenger and freight "two dragons." Because there are cargo transportation lines with interlocking production, supply, transportation, and sales, and "one ticket to home" passenger transportation lines connecting stations, trains, shops, and ships step by step, cargo turnover has been greatly accelerated and passengers have been facilitated. They call this a great revolution in transportation organization.

In today's discussion, many representatives from the cultural and educational front reflected the unprecedented prosperity of cultural and educational undertakings in various parts of our country in their speeches. Guan Wenwei, Deputy Governor of Jiangsu Province, talked about the significant achievements of Jiangsu Province in running agricultural middle schools on a large scale. There are now more than 2,000 agricultural (vocational) middle schools in the province, with more than 279,000 students. Guan Wenwei said that this is a new seedling in the socialist education garden, which was established in less than a month in the spring of 1958, and now this new seedling has grown strong. Because the teaching of agricultural middle schools is closely linked to practice and closely integrated with labor production and scientific research, students' knowledge levels are constantly improving. Farmers praise the agricultural middle school students who have mastered scientific knowledge as "being very magical, saying rain is rain, saying wind is wind." Guan Wenwei said that all of this is the great victory of Mao Zedong's educational thought, and a good way to develop secondary education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This summer and next spring, this new seedling will bear the first batch of fruits, and 130,000 agricultural middle school students will graduate in the province, and they will become a large reserve force of technical strength for rural people's communes. Li Hui, Deputy Commissioner of the Jinan Special Office in Shanxi Province, vividly talked about the prosperity of Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, through phonetic literacy to accelerate the knowledge of workers and peasants. Li Hui said that phonetic literacy not only accelerates the speed of illiteracy eradication, solves the problem of consolidation and improvement after illiteracy eradication, but also greatly promotes Mandarin. Now 97% of the young and middle-aged people in Wanrong County have been freed from illiteracy, with an average of only two months; reading has become a trend in rural areas, and there has been an unprecedented and gratifying phenomenon of farmers queuing to buy books; half of the population in the county can speak Mandarin. Li Hui said that some young and middle-aged farmers have already read one or two hundred books, and some elderly women have also carried their schoolbags and studied diligently. They spell, read, write poetry, and speak Mandarin, which is really a liberation of thought and a happy mood. An old man wrote a poem praising: "The pine tree grows greener and greener, the older people live, the younger they become, the Communist Party leads really well, and I hate to live fifty more years." All of this shows that the mass cultural learning movement has greatly changed people's mental outlook and social atmosphere.

Many miracles have also appeared on the health work front. Xin'an People's Commune in Xushui County, Hebei Province, created the "miracle of no mosquitoes in the Dianbo," demonstrating the great spirit of our working people in transforming the world. Xin'an People's Commune is a famous water town, with a total of 24 large and small Dianbo and more than 290 trenches, which store water all year round, which is a happy world for mosquito breeding. In the past, people exaggeratedly described the mosquitoes in Baiyangdian as being as big as sparrows, and they could be stung through two layers of clothing. Zhang Guozhong, the people's representative and First Secretary of the Xushui County Party Committee who came from here, said that now, this water town has created the miracle of basically no mosquitoes in the Dianbo, and the world of mosquitoes and flies has become a civilized and happy water town. The local people are delighted and unanimously praised: "The Communist Party has good ideas, the people's commune is strong, production is leaping forward year after year, mosquitoes and flies are swept away, everyone is healthy and not sick, and old men become young men." Zhu Guang, Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province, talked about the great leap forward in health work in Foshan City, a national health red flag unit. He said that Foshan City, which had been filthy and dilapidated for thousands of years, has become a beautiful and clean city. Now it is continuing to advance towards a modern industrial city and a city of culture and art!

Other representatives from the fields of culture, education, health, and sports all talked about their new achievements in their work, expressing their ambition to continue to leap forward. Guo Yingqiu, President of Nanjing University, Ke Zhao, Professor of Sichuan University, and Tao Shufan, Principal of Beijing No. 2 Experimental Primary School, all talked about the great victory of the Party's education policy, and expressed their intention to continue to improve the quality of teaching and cultivate talents for construction at high speed and with high quality. Artists Liu Kaiqu, Hua Junwu, Wu Zuoren, and Pan Tianshou proposed to achieve a great leap forward in the field of fine arts. The famous weightlifter Chen Jingkai expressed his determination to set ambitious goals and strive to climb to the peak of world sports technology.

Many representatives talked about the great spirit of our farmers in transforming rivers and mountains with the momentum of moving mountains and overturning seas after the communization. The Yellow River, which has suffered from siltation for thousands of years, has now made significant achievements in fundamentally controlling soil erosion. Deng Baoshan, Governor of Gansu Province, brought encouraging news in this regard. He said that thanks to the hard work of the people of Gansu, 89,000 square kilometers of the 126,000 square kilometers of soil erosion area in the Yellow River Basin have been treated, and the amount of sediment flowing into the Yellow River can be reduced by more than 100 million tons. He said that after two years of great leap forward, soil and water conservation in Gansu has developed from the treatment of one ditch and one slope to a new stage of comprehensive management of large areas by watersheds and mountain systems, linking communes and counties. Last winter and this spring, 2.9 million people spent only a few months managing an area of 30,000 square kilometers and consolidating and improving an area of more than 20,000 square kilometers. After this battle, the area managed in the province reached 65% of the total area of soil erosion. This has greatly accelerated the process of changing the arid face of Gansu and contributed to the fundamental control of the Yellow River. Lin Yixin, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that the people's commune has created favorable conditions for the high-speed development of mountain area economy and the development of other socialist construction undertakings. In just two months, Fujian Province mobilized more than 3 million people to go to the mountains to reclaim wasteland and build terraced fields of more than 4 million mu, and the afforestation area reached more than 17 million mu. At the same time, the people in the coastal areas have set off a wave of marching towards the sea and fighting for land with the sea, carrying out sea beach reclamation and winning more than 240,000 mu of new cultivated land, so that the people's communes in the coastal areas with little land have rapidly expanded their production scale.

Liu Wenhui, Minister of Forestry, talked about the large-scale and high-speed afforestation in the past two years, which is not only unprecedented in our country, but also beyond the reach of the capitalist world. He said that the people's commune has created extremely favorable conditions for forestry construction. In 1960, forestry should focus on consolidating, improving, and developing commune-run forest farms and state-owned forest farms, actively realizing the production base of forestry, the forest farm management of forestry, and the rapid growth and high yield of forest cultivation, and promoting the mass movement of forestry construction to a new stage.

The representatives who spoke at today's meeting also included Guo Shude, Su Guangming, Pu Guizhong, Qin Renchang, Li Enye, Rao Xingli, Guan Musheng, Tian Enbo, Zhu Guoyun, Yan Renhai, Du Guoxiang, Meng Qingyuan, Wu Yaozong, Yuan Renyuan, Hu Ming, Ren Zhongyi, Xi Rao Jia Cuo, Jia Baozhi, Wang Dechang, He Ju, Yi Xiangsu, Cheng Menxue, Wang Quanhuang, Hu Juewen, Tan Yubao, Chen Shaokuan, Peng Zugui, and Liang Guang.

The executive chairmen who presided over the two general meetings this morning and afternoon were: Saifuding, Zhang Chong, Xiong Kewu, He Bingyan, Zhu Dehai, Lin Qiaozhi, Han Wangchen, Tao Zhiyue, Yang Hanxian, Chen Shutong, Liu Ningyi, Cai Tingkai, Shi Liang, Zhu Kezhen, Zhou Gucheng, Wu Yaozong, Wang Shaoao, Ye Shengtao, Hu Juewen, Lin Feng, Lai Chuanzhu, Zhan Dong·Ji Jinmei, Deng Chumin, Sangji Yuexi, Shu Sheyu, Li Sichi, Dao Jingban, Deng Fangzhi, Cheng Qian, Zhou Yang, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yuan, Qian Chongshu, Xie Fumin, Shao Lizi, Xu Guangping, Ji Fang, Guo Dihuo, and Zhang Shizhao.

The meeting will continue tomorrow.

Xinhua News Agency, April 5th. The Second Session of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC continued to hold general discussions in two venues this morning and afternoon.

The committee members who came from rural areas or had been to rural areas reflected in their speeches the great power of the rural people's communes and the magnificent momentum of the rural great leap forward, and used a large number of specific facts to illustrate the Party's policy of developing agriculture with brilliance and correctness. Zhou Guilin, Deputy Director of the Hongguang People's Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, reported the achievements of the Hongguang People's Commune in conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture and achieving consecutive great leaps forward in production. He said that the 50 mu of rapeseed fields that Chairman Mao had visited in this commune achieved an average yield of 500 jin per mu last year. Committee member Gao Fengzhi said in a written speech that his hometown, the Liuhe Management District of the Xingfu People's Commune in Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, implemented the policy of taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way. In 1959, grain output increased by 21.5% compared with 1958, which was equal to 2.2 times that of 1957. At present, the commune members are fighting for a bumper harvest this year with the support of industry and other aspects. Due to the increase in tractors and other agricultural tools, 80% of the cultivated land can be mechanized. Committee member Jiang Bingling used the achievements of Hubei Province in overcoming the extraordinary drought that had not occurred in seventy-two years last year and building the Hanjiang Danjiangkou water conservancy project to illustrate the unparalleled superiority and strong vitality of the people's commune. Yang Huian, Director of the Horticulture Department of Huazhong Agricultural College, said that actively carrying out agricultural technical transformation is an important condition for ensuring the continuous leap forward in agricultural production. Agricultural educators should take promoting agricultural technical transformation and promoting the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program as the central task in teaching and scientific research.

Many committee members excitedly said that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement launched in various parts of the country with the force of thunder will stimulate the infinite wisdom and creativity of the people. Committee member Gu Jiguang used many vivid examples he saw in construction units in Wuhan, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Sanmenxia to illustrate the high enthusiasm and creativity shown by the people after they became the masters of the country. When Wuhan Iron and Steel Company was building a chimney as high as 100 meters, the workers dared to think and dared to do, broke the rules, adopted new operating methods, and reduced the project that was originally scheduled to be completed in more than 120 days to only eleven and a half days, and the quality was very good. Huang Youmou, Vice President of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, used the poems created by workers to reflect the heroic spirit of the vast number of employees in Guangdong Province in conquering technical backwardness. The workers' poems sang: "Each equipment is replaced with new clothes, everyone has a new gun in hand, every process is automated, and manual operations are eliminated." Committee members Liu Dingwu and Wang Deyu talked about the achievements of Beijing and Harbin in vigorously carrying out technical innovation.

Some committee members talked about the superiority of the enterprise management method of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" shown in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Lian Tisheng, Vice Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, said that the cadres, technicians, and workers of the Fuzhou Tea Factory and the Xiamen Transportation Department have changed the original backward manual operations in a short period of time due to close integration. The employees of the Fuzhou Tea Factory changed hundreds of manual tea-making processes to mechanization, ending the history of manual tea-making for many years. The Xiamen Transportation Department has changed the situation of shoulder carrying, carrying, back carrying, and lifting in the handling and loading and unloading work by making 3,600 pieces of loading and unloading and handling tools and machines. The handling workers sang heroically: "The dock workers are full of energy, constantly innovating to turn the soil into foreign, shoulder scarves are taken off as aprons, and the sound of hi yo is replaced by the sound of motors." Sun Weizhong, an engineer from a worker's background, said that some factories in Tianjin have adopted the method of two participations, one reform, and three combinations to vigorously carry out the comprehensive utilization of seawater, and have successfully researched and developed many new pesticide products. Shui Xiheng, Chief Engineer of Chongqing Water Supply Company, said that a new water plant in Chongqing, Sichuan Province, has solved many complex technical problems in the process of implementing operation mechanization and remote control through two participations, one reform, and three combinations.

From the speeches of the committee members from the cultural and educational front, it can be seen that with the in-depth development of the economic revolution, political revolution, ideological revolution, and technical revolution, the climax of the cultural revolution has arrived. Educators Zhu Wuhua, Chen Enfeng, Gu Maoxun, Zhang Quan, Huang Shupei, and Han Zude listed a large number of facts today to illustrate that with the great leap forward in economic construction, education is also like the rising sun, full of spring, and enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the Party's education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor.

Zhu Wuhua, Vice President of Harbin Institute of Technology, introduced in detail in a written speech that the teachers and students of Harbin Institute of Technology cooperated with more than 100 local factories to complete more than 460 mechanization and automation projects, including the design and manufacture of 73 automatic production lines and more than 100 automatic single machines. He said that Harbin Institute of Technology will better implement the Party's education policy, hold high the red flag of factory-school cooperation, and attack the scientific fortress. Wang Yue, Vice President of Jinan University, introduced the progress of returned overseas Chinese students studying at Jinan University, praising the Party's meticulous care and training of returned overseas Chinese students. He expressed that they must boost their energy and accelerate the training of returned overseas Chinese students to become outstanding talents for building a socialist motherland.

Committee member Mei Lanfang spoke on behalf of the opera circles Zhou Xinfang, Ding Guoxian, Yin Xi, Shen Peihua, Su Yumin, Li Zaiwen, Chen Shufang, Xiao Changhua, Wu Tianbao, Zheng Yizou, Zhou Huinong, Yuan Xuefen, Yu Zhenfei, Ma Shizeng, Chang Xiangyu, Peng Linong, Kuang Jianlian, Han Shichang, and Han Junqing. He emphasized that the opera circles should continue to conscientiously study Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and push the opera cause in our country to a new peak. Painters Feng Zikai and Wang Geyi expressed in their speeches that they would strive to create more new and beautiful paintings that are worthy of the times.

More than ten health professionals who spoke today all believed that in order to ensure the continuous leap forward of socialist construction, it is necessary to continue to vigorously carry out the movement of eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and vigorously carrying out sports exercises with the revolutionary spirit of changing customs and transforming the world. The joint speech of the famous gynecology expert Lin Qiaozhi and the Vice President of the Chinese Medical Association Huang Dingchen reported that when they inspected Shanxi Province Jishan County, the national rural health red flag, they said that after the realization of the people's commune, Jishan County established a complete health care network and effective system, popularized national health education and sports exercises, and ensured that more than 95% of the labor force regularly participated in production. They said that this is the result of holding high the victorious banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the health care cause and giving full play to the powerful superiority of the people's commune. They believed that from the changes in Jishan County, they can look forward to the rural health care work across the country with full confidence, and will definitely move towards the goal of changing customs and transforming the world rapidly. Chen Lijie, Deputy Mayor of Hangzhou, said that Xiaoying Lane, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, which Chairman Mao once inspected, has persisted in health and sports activities for many years and has become a good example for Hangzhou. Now, under the slogan of "learning from Xiaoying Lane and catching up with Xiaoying Lane," the city's residents have launched a patriotic health movement on a scale that exceeds any previous period. Liang Yiwen, who has been engaged in medical work for more than 30 years, used the successful example of Guangzhou Municipal Second Hospital rescuing patients with large-area burns to illustrate that under the leadership of the Party, medical workers can give full play to communist large-scale collaboration and have the power to bring the dead back to life. Pu Fuzhou, Shi Xiaoshan, Qin Bowei, Ye Juquan and others engaged in traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine expressed their cheers for the great victory of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, and expressed that they would play a greater role in the struggle to prevent and treat diseases.

The famous old Chinese medicine doctor Pu Fuzhou said that thanks to the Party's attention and care for traditional Chinese medicine, the new force of traditional Chinese medicine is growing rapidly. There are currently 24 traditional Chinese medicine colleges in the country with more than 5,000 students; there are also more than 2,300 Western medicine doctors who have left their jobs to study traditional Chinese medicine, and more than 36,000 in-service Western medicine doctors are also studying traditional Chinese medicine treatment methods; in particular, the method of utilizing the excellent tradition of traditional Chinese medicine, teachers leading apprentices, has trained more than 80,000 apprentices. At present, a new situation in the medical cause has been formed in which traditional Chinese medicine, Western medicine, elderly doctors, and young doctors are integrated.

Some committee members also talked about the superiority of urban people's communes in their speeches. Committee member Wang Yunsheng said: "We people living in big cities pay special attention to the issue of urban people's communes." When he went to Zhengzhou and Luoyang in Henan Province for inspection, he saw that after the establishment of the people's commune, production was developed, the living standard was improved, people's spiritual outlook and social relations were changed, unity was enhanced, and the transformation of the city was accelerated. The people's communes in Zhengzhou and Luoyang have liberated a large number of housewives, who have participated in state-owned factories, street industries, and service undertakings, established factories such as electrical decoration, chemical industry, and clothing processing, and vigorously run public canteens, nurseries, and service stations, and have served everything needed for people's lives very well. He said that the urban people's commune is really good.

The committee members emphasized in their speeches that the vigorous momentum shown by the vast number of people in our country in the economic, political, ideological, technical, and cultural revolution movements fully demonstrates the unparalleled power of Mao Zedong Thought. Ji Fang, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, and many committee members expressed that they would strive to study Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong's works to accelerate ideological transformation. Committee members Nie Zhen, Zhang Yi, Chen Zhongfan, Wen Shaohe, and He Siyuan said that in the situation of the continued deepening of the socialist revolution, it is necessary to severely destroy bourgeois ideology, vigorously promote proletarian ideology, completely abandon individualism, and completely transform the bourgeois world outlook. Nie Zhen, Vice President of the Socialist Academy, spoke on the study and transformation of students at the Socialist Academy. He pointed out that in order for students to adapt to the development of the situation, they must consciously be promoters of promoting the progress of human history, and they must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works so that they can accelerate the political transformation and the transformation of the world outlook.

Religious figures Pi Shushi, Yang Shida, Zhang Shilang, and Zhang Jiashu severely criticized the US imperialism for using religion to carry out criminal subversive activities in their speeches. They said that Chinese Catholics must persevere in the anti-imperialist patriotic movement, resolutely get rid of all control by the Roman Curia that serves imperialism, and completely realize the independent and self-run church.

Among the 94 committee members who spoke or gave written speeches at the two venues today, there were also Weng Wenhao, Ma Baosan, Hu Shitong, Wang Zhaojun, Fan Quan, Zhou Shiguan, Yan Duhe, Zhu Dingqing, Wu Shihe, Zheng Jianxuan, Shen Zhaonian, Huang Yuxian, Tian Fuda, Xie Xuetang, Qiu Lin, Su Ziheng, Chen Wen, Chen Wenbin, Xu Mengshan, Lu Shuxiang, Zhang Deqing, Lu Zhenfan, Dong Zhujun, Zhang Weicen, Miao Hainan, Fang Xianzhi, Yu Chujie, Wang Guoxiu, Li Peiji, Ye Gongchuo, Mi Zanchen, Qiu Chen, Lu Jiyi, Chen Diaofu, Lu Rongshu, etc.

The general discussion will continue tomorrow.

    攀登现代科学技术和文化高峰建设强大的社会主义祖国
    全民技术革命文化革命万紫千红
    人大和政协继续举行大会，各地代表畅谈繁荣的新景象
    新华社5日讯　第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议，今天继续分两个会场举行大会。来自各个战线的代表畅谈了各地开展技术革命和文化革命运动出现的繁荣景象。会上大量的事实表明：我国人民全面改变技术落后、文化落后状态的伟大革命，正在如火如荼地广泛展开。
    安徽省省长黄岩在发言中以大量的事实，生动地说明了技术革新和技术革命运动的巨大威力。在这个省，由于开展了全民性的技术革新运动，各条战线的生产都获得了迅速发展，并且节约了大量劳动力。在农业战线上，全省从去年1月到今年3月，推广使用了新式农具和改良农具四千七百多万件，仅去年一年，全省节省的劳动工日就达二十亿个。去冬今春全省治水工地由于普遍使用了改良工具和半机械化工具，每人每天的效率已可抵上1950年开始治淮时的十四个人。全省工业交通部门去年新建扩建的项目有一千二百二十一个，总产值增长了55％，但由于开展了技术革新运动，所使用的劳动力却比1958年减少了三十六万多人。今年1月到3月，全省厂矿企业在技术革新中又节约了九万多人，实现了增产不增人。中共甘肃省委书记王秉祥说，技术革新运动也在甘肃发展成为声势浩大的全民运动。仅兰州一地在两个半月中就实现了四千一百多项重大改革，全市出现了四百多条流水作业线，生产联动线和自动线、半自动线。许多地方的职工由于“干”字当头，“巧”字开路，大胆革新，作到了增产不增人，一人顶几人。中共阜新市委第一书记丘新野谈到煤矿职工的革新成就。阜新煤矿职工在革新运动中第一次创造出攉煤机，使攉煤工人扔下了世世代代使用的大铁锹。这一创造就像钥匙一样打开了广大职工的智慧宝库，全矿从采煤、掘进等主要工种工人，一直到炊事员、保育员、勤杂人员和职工家属，都卷入到技术革命的洪流中。丘新野说，到3月10日止，阜新市已经创造出机具七百五十二件，整个阜新煤矿直接工种的机械化程度，已经达到了85％，使七千多人解除了笨重的体力劳动和手工操作，许多采煤工作面的产量和效率都增长了两、三倍。
    来自交通运输战线的代表贵阳铁路局总工程师刘建熙说，贵州的铁路建设在去年黔桂铁路通车到贵阳以后，正在加速向前发展。现在川黔、滇黔、湘黔铁路也在加紧施工，许多支线和厂矿专用线在分批修筑，一个新兴的铁路网已经展现在人们的面前。他说，我们决心继续大搞技术革新和技术革命，争取早日把贵州山区的铁路修得四通八达。沈阳铁路局运输处副处长李锡奎和另外两位代表孙孝菊、郑锡坤在联合发言中，介绍了他们把沈阳铁路局和鞍钢、抚顺、大连港等兄弟企业以及地方服务行业大协作，组织客运、货运“两条龙”的情况。由于出现了产、供、运、销环环相扣，一线相连的货物运输线——“货龙”，和站、车、店、船步步相接，“一票到家”的旅客运输线——“客龙”，大大加速了货物周转，方便了旅客。他们把这称作是运输组织工作的大革命。
    在今天的讨论中，来自文化教育战线上的许多代表在发言中，反映了我国各地文化教育事业空前繁荣的景象。江苏省副省长管文蔚谈到江苏省大办农业中学的重大成就。这个省的农（职）业中学现在已有二千多所，学生达到二十七万九千多人。管文蔚说，这是一株社会主义教育园地里的新苗，它是在1958年春天不到一个月的时间内建立起来的，现在这株新苗已经茁壮地成长起来。由于农业中学的教学密切联系实际，同劳动生产和科学研究紧密结合，学生的知识水平不断提高。农民赞扬掌握了科学知识的农中学生是“大有神通，说雨就雨，说风就风”。管文蔚说，这一切都是毛泽东教育思想的伟大胜利，是多快好省发展中等教育事业的很好途径。今夏和明春，这株新苗将结出第一批果实，全省将有十三万农业中学的学生毕业，他们将成为农村人民公社很大一批技术力量的后备军。山西省晋南专署副专员李辉，生动地谈到山西万荣县通过注音识字加速工农知识化所出现的繁荣景象。李辉说，通过注音识字不仅加快了扫盲的速度，解决了脱盲以后的巩固提高问题，而且大大推广了普通话。现在万荣县97％的青壮年已经脱盲，平均只用了两个月的时间；农村里读书成了风气，出现了农民排队买书的史无前例的可喜现象；全县有一半的人口能说普通话。李辉说，现在有些青壮年农民已经读了一、二百本书，有些老年妇女也背起了书包，苦心学习，她们拼写，读书，作诗，说普通话，真是思想解放，心情舒畅。一位老年人写诗歌颂说：“松树越长越发青，老人越活越年轻，共产党领导真正好，我再活五十还嫌少。”这一切都表明，群众文化学习运动使人们的精神面貌和社会风气大大地改变了。
    在卫生工作战线上也出现了许多奇迹。河北省徐水县新安人民公社创造“淀泊无蚊的奇迹”，显示了我国劳动人民改造世界的伟大气概。新安人民公社是一个有名的水乡，全社共有大小淀泊二十四处，壕沟二百九十多条，常年储水，是蚊子繁殖的快乐世界，过去人们夸张地形容白洋淀的蚊子像麻雀那么大，穿上两层单衣服也能被叮透。来自这里的人民代表、中共徐水县委第一书记张国忠说，现在，这个水乡已经创造了淀泊基本无蚊的奇迹，蚊蝇世界变成了文明幸福的水乡。当地的人民对此欢欣鼓舞，众口一致地称颂说：“共产党，好主张，人民公社力量强，生产年年大跃进，蚊子苍蝇一扫光，人人健康不生病，老头变成少年郎。”广东省副省长朱光谈到了全国卫生红旗单位佛山市卫生工作大跃进的情况。他说，千百年来污秽破烂的佛山市，已经变成了一个美丽整洁的城市。现在它正向着现代工业之城，文化艺术之城继续前进！
    其他来自文教卫生和体育战线上的代表，都谈到了他们工作中的新成就，表示了继续跃进的雄心壮志。南京大学校长郭影秋、四川大学教授柯召和北京第二实验小学校长陶淑范，都谈到党的教育方针的伟大胜利，表示要继续提高教学质量，高速度，高质量地培养建设人才。美术家刘开渠、华君武、吴作人、潘天寿等人，提出要在美术事业上实现大跃进。著名举重运动员陈镜开，表示要立雄心壮志，努力攀登世界运动技术水平的顶峰。
    许多代表在发言中谈到我国农民在公社化以后，以移山倒海之势改造河山的伟大气概。由于泥沙淤积而千年为患的黄河，现在已在根治水土流失方面取得了重大成绩。甘肃省省长邓宝珊带来了这方面令人鼓舞的消息，他说，由于甘肃人民的艰苦奋斗，黄河流域十二万六千平方公里的水土流失面积，已经有八万九千平方公里得到了治理，流入黄河的泥沙量约可减少一亿多吨。他说，甘肃的水土保持，经过两年来的大跃进，已从一沟一坡的治理，发展到按流域、按山系联社、联县大面积综合治理的新阶段。去冬今春，二百九十万群众只短短几个月，就治理了三万平方公里的面积，巩固提高面积两万多平方公里，经过这次战役，全省治理的面积达到水土流失总面积的65％。这大大加快了改变甘肃干旱面貌的进程，并为根治黄河贡献了力量。中共福建省委书记林一心说，人民公社化为高速度开发山区经济和发展其它社会主义建设事业创造了有利的条件。福建省在短短两个月时间内，就发动了三百多万人上山，开荒修梯田四百多万亩，造林面积达一千七百多万亩。在这同时，沿海地区人民掀起了向海进军、与海争地的浪潮，进行海滩围垦，夺得了二十四万多亩新的耕地，使少地的沿海人民公社迅速扩大了生产规模。
    林业部长刘文辉谈到两年来大规模高速度的造林，不仅在我国是亘古未有，而且在资本主义世界也是望尘莫及。他说，人民公社化为林业建设创造了极其有利的条件，1960年在林业方面要以巩固、提高和发展社办林场及国营林场为中心，积极实现林业生产基地化，林业经营林场化，林木培育速生丰产化，把林业建设的群众运动推向新的阶段。

    新华社5日讯　政协第三届全国委员会第二次会议今天上午和下午继续分别在两个会场进行大会讨论。
    来自农村或到过农村的委员在发言中，反映了农村人民公社的巨大威力和农村大跃进的雄威气势，并以大量具体事实说明党的发展农业的方针的英明、正确，四川省郫县红光人民公社副社长周桂林，报告了红光人民公社认真地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，生产连年大跃进的成果。他说毛主席曾经到这个公社看过的五十亩油菜田，去年平均亩产达到五百斤。委员高凤志在书面发言中，谈到他的家乡黑龙江省绥化县兴福人民公社六合管理区，执行以粮为纲，全面发展的方针，1959年粮食产量比1958年增加21.5％，等于1957年的二点二倍。目前社员们正在工业和其他方面的支援下，为今年的大丰收而战斗，由于增加了拖拉机和其他农具，80％的耕地可以实现机械化。江炳灵委员以湖北省去年战胜七十二年没有过的特大旱灾和兴修汉江丹江口水利工程的成就，说明人民公社的无比优越性和强大生命力。华中农学院园艺系主任杨惠安说，积极地进行农业技术改造，是保证农业生产持续跃进的重要条件，农业教育工作者在教学、科学研究中，应当以推进农业技术改造，促进全国农业发展纲要提前实现为中心任务。
    许多委员兴奋地说，全国各地以雷霆万钧之势开展的技术革新和技术革命运动，将激发人民群众无穷的智慧和创造力。委员谷霁光用他在武汉、郑州、洛阳和三门峡等地建设单位看到的许多生动事例，说明人民群众成为国家的主人以后，所表现出来的高度积极性和创造性。武汉钢铁公司在建设高达一百米高的烟囱时，工人们敢想敢干，打破常规，采用新的操作方法，将原定需要一百二十多天完工的工程，缩减到只用十一天半就完成了，而且质量很好。中国科学院广州分院副院长黄友谋用工人创作的诗歌，反映广东省广大职工在征服技术落后的进军中的英雄气概，工人的诗唱道：“台台设备换新装，人人手上拿新枪，道道工序自动化，手工操作消灭光。”刘定五、王德舆两位委员分别谈到了北京市和哈尔滨市大搞技术革新的成就。
    有些委员在发言中，谈到了“两参一改三结合”的企业管理方法，在技术革新和技术革命运动中显示的优越性。福建省政协副主席练惕生说，福州茶厂和厦门市运输部门的干部、技术人员和工人，都由于紧密结合，在短时间内，改变了原来落后的手工操作。福州茶厂的职工把成百道的手工制茶工序改为机械化后，结束了多少年来手工制茶的历史。厦门市运输部门由于制成了三千六百多件装卸、搬运工具和机器，改变了搬运装卸工作的肩挑、扛、背、抬的状况，搬运工人豪迈地唱道：“码头工人气昂昂，不断革新土变洋，肩巾脱掉当围裙，嗨哟声绝马达响。”工人出身的工程师孙维忠说，天津市有的工厂采用两参一改三结合的办法，大搞海水综合利用，已经研究成功许多农药新产品。重庆自来水公司总工程师税西恒说，四川省重庆市新建的一个水厂，通过两参一改三结合，解决了实行操作机械化和远距离控制过程中许多复杂的技术问题。
    从来自文化教育战线的委员们的发言中，可以看出随着经济革命、政治革命、思想革命和技术革命的深入开展，文化革命高潮已经来临。教育界人士朱物华、陈恩凤、顾懋勋、张铨、黄叔培、韩祖德等委员，今天列举大量事实，说明随着经济建设的大跃进，教育事业也如旭日东升，满园春色，并且热烈赞颂党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合的方针的伟大成果。
    哈尔滨工业大学副校长朱物华在书面发言中，详细介绍了哈尔滨工业大学师生同当地一百多个工厂实行协作，完成了四百六十多个机械化、自动化项目，其中设计制造了自动化生产线七十三条、自动化单机一百多台。他表示哈尔滨工业大学将更好地贯彻执行党的教育方针，高举厂、校协作的红旗，猛攻科学堡垒。暨南大学副校长王越在发言中介绍了在暨南大学学习的归侨学生进步的情况，称颂党对归侨学生无微不至的关怀和培养。他表示他们一定要鼓足干劲，加速把归侨学生培养成为建设社会主义祖国的优秀人材。
    梅兰芳委员代表戏曲界人士周信芳、丁果仙、尹羲、沈佩华、苏育民、李再雯、陈书舫、萧长华、吴天保、郑奕奏、周惠侬、袁雪芬、俞振飞、马师曾、常香玉、彭俐侬、邝健廉、韩世昌、韩俊卿等委员发言。他着重指出，戏曲界要继续认真学习毛主席文艺思想，把我国戏曲事业推向新的高峰。画家丰子恺、王个簃在发言中表示要努力创作出无愧于时代的更新更美的图画来。
    在今天发言的十多位卫生界人士都认为，为了保证社会主义建设事业的不断跃进，必须以移风易俗、改造世界的革命气魄，大张旗鼓地继续开展除四害、讲卫生和大搞体育锻炼的运动。著名的妇科医学专家林巧稚和中华医学会副会长黄鼎臣两人的联合发言，汇报他们视察全国农村卫生红旗——山西省稷山县的情况时说，稷山县在实现人民公社化以后，建立了一套完整的卫生保健网和行之有效的制度，普及了全民卫生教育和体育锻炼运动，保证了95％以上的劳动力经常参加生产。他们说，这是在卫生保健事业中高举毛泽东思想的胜利旗帜，充分发挥人民公社的强大优越性的结果。他们认为从稷山县的变化中，可以满怀信心地展望全国农村卫生保健工作，一定会迅速地向移风易俗、改造世界的目标迈进。杭州市副市长陈礼节说，毛主席曾经视察过的浙江省杭州市小营巷，数年如一日地坚持卫生、体育运动，已经成为杭州市的好榜样。现在，全市居民在
  “学小营巷，赶小营巷”的口号下，开展了一个规模超过以往任何时期的爱国卫生运动。从事医务工作三十多年的梁毅文，以广州市立第二医院抢救大面积烧伤病人成功的事例，说明在党的领导下，医务工作者充分发挥共产主义大协作，就会具有起死回生的力量。从事中医中药事业的蒲辅周、石筱山、秦伯未、叶橘泉等人在发言中，欢呼党的中医政策的伟大胜利，表示要在防治疾病的斗争中，发挥中医中药的更大作用。
    著名老中医蒲辅周说，由于党对中医的重视和关怀，中医的新生力量正在迅速成长。全国现有二十四所中医学院，共有学生五千多人；还有两千三百多名西医离职学习中医，三万六千多名在职西医也在学习中医治法；特别是利用中医的优良传统老师带徒弟的方法，培养了八万多名徒弟。目前已经形成了中医西医、老年医生、青年医生结成一体的医疗事业新局面。
    有的委员在发言中还谈到城市人民公社的优越性。王芸生委员说：“我们生活在大城市的人，特别注意城市人民公社问题。”他到河南省郑州、洛阳两市视察时，看到那里办起人民公社以后，发展了生产，提高了生活水平，改变了人们的精神面貌和社会关系，增进了团结，加速了城市的改造。郑州、洛阳两市的人民公社，解放出大批家庭妇女，她们参加了国营工厂、街道工业和服务性事业，兴办了电器装修、化工、被服加工等工厂，大办公共食堂、托儿所和服务站，把人民生活所需要的都服务得很好。他说，城市人民公社实在好。
    委员们在发言中强调指出：当前我国广大人民在经济、政治、思想、技术和文化革命运动中所表现出的磅礴气势，充分显示了毛泽东思想的无比威力。农工民主党中央委员会主席团主席季方和不少委员都表示要努力学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东著作，加速思想改造。聂真、张毅、陈中凡、温少鹤、何思源等委员说，在社会主义革命继续深入的形势下，必须狠灭资产阶级思想，大兴无产阶级思想，彻底抛弃个人主义，彻底改造资产阶级的世界观。社会主义学院副院长聂真就社会主义学院学员的学习和改造问题发言，他指出学员们要使自己能适应形势的发展，就要主动地做一个促进人类历史进步的促进派，就必须认真学习毛主席著作，这样才可以加速政治上的改造和世界观的改造。
    宗教界人士皮漱石、杨士达、张士琅、张家树在发言中，严词指责美帝国主义利用宗教进行罪恶的颠复活动。他们说，中国天主教友一定要把反帝爱国运动坚持下去，坚决摆脱为帝国主义效劳的罗马教廷的一切控制，彻底实现独立自主自办教会。
    今天在两个会场上发言或书面发言的九十四名委员中，还有翁文灏、马保三、胡师童、王兆俊、范权、周士观、严独鹤、朱鼎卿、吴世鹤、郑建宣、沈肇年、黄育贤、田富达、谢雪堂、丘琳、苏子蘅、陈文、陈文彬、徐萌山、吕叔湘，张德庆、陆镇藩、董竹君、张蔚岑、苗海南、方先之、喻楚杰、王国秀、李培基、叶恭绰、米暂沉、丘辰、吕集义、陈调甫、陆榕树等。
