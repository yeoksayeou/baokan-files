Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) decided today that if the ruling Liberal Democratic Party forcibly ends the Diet debate on the new "Security Treaty" or attempts to extend the current Diet session, it will hold a general strike throughout the country. At the same time, Sohyo Secretary-General Akira Iwai issued a statement today announcing that Sohyo will mobilize 20 million people to petition the Diet in the 16th national unified action against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." This larger-scale petition will begin on May 10th and reach its climax on the 15th.
	Sohyo held a meeting of local organization representatives in Tokyo today. The meeting considered that the 15th unified action against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," held across the country yesterday, had achieved even greater success than previous unified actions against the "Security Treaty."
	The meeting also decided that all workers of Sohyo will strengthen the fundraising campaign to support the struggle of the Miike coal mine workers against layoffs.
	The meeting heard a report by Socialist Party Diet member Matatabi Tagaya on the current situation of the struggle in the Diet.
	Tagaya revealed that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling party plan to submit a motion to end the debate on the new "Security Treaty" on May 10th. If this fails, they will submit a motion to extend the current Diet session.
	Tagaya emphasized that progressive forces inside and outside the Diet should take strong actions to prevent the ruling party from realizing this attempt.
Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th: After the Kishi Nobusuke group's conspiracy to force the House of Representatives to pass the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" before the 26th was thwarted by the Japanese people, yesterday they decided to force the House of Representatives to pass this aggressive military alliance treaty before May 10th.
	Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi convened a meeting of 55 Diet members from the Nobusuke Kishi faction of the Liberal Democratic Party yesterday to discuss the issue of Diet ratification of the treaty. Kishi emphasized at the meeting that ratifying the revised U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is the most important task facing his government. He said, "We must ensure that this treaty is passed during this Diet session."
	Nobusuke Kishi's close aide, Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Masajiro Kawashima, further explained that the Liberal Democratic Party is determined to do everything possible to have the House of Representatives pass the new "Security Treaty" before May 10th.
	Kishi Nobusuke and Kawashima Masajiro both asked these members to "strengthen unity" to realize their conspiracy.
	Prior to this, Kawashima had also revealed that the Kishi Nobusuke group is preparing to extend the Diet session in order to have the treaty ratified during the current Diet session.
	According to reports, the Kishi Nobusuke group's urgent desire to have the Diet pass the treaty as soon as possible, despite strong opposition from the Japanese public and public opinion, is related to U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower's scheduled visit to Japan on June 19th. Nobusuke Kishi hopes to be able to "present a gift" to the U.S. President at that time.

    反对日美条约的斗争巨浪不断高涨
    日本两千万人将投入斗争
    岸信介集团决定要在五月十日前强行通过日美条约
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天决定，如果执政的自由民主党强行结束国会关于新“安全条约”的辩论或者企图延长本届国会会期，它将在全国举行总罢工。同时，日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章今天发表谈话，宣布总评议会将在第十六次反对批准新“安全条约”全国统一行动中动员两千万人向国会请愿。这次更大规模的请愿将从5月10日开始，在15日达到最高潮。
    总评议会今天在东京举行了地方组织代表会议。会议认为，昨天在全国各地举行的第十五次反对批准新“安全条约”统一行动取得了比过去历次反对“安全条约”统一行动都更为巨大的成就。
    会议还决定，总评议会的全体工人将加强募捐运动，来支持三池煤矿工人反对解雇的斗争。
    会议听取了社会党国会议员多贺谷真稔提出的关于目前国会内斗争情况的报告。
    多贺谷真稔揭露，岸信介政府和执政党计划提出关于在5月10日结束关于新“安全条约”的辩论的动议，如果这不能得逞，它们将提出要求延长本届国会会期的动议。
    多贺谷真稔着重指出，国会内外的进步力量应当采取强有力的行动阻止执政党实现这种企图。
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本岸信介集团企图迫使众议院在26日以前通过新日美“安全条约”的阴谋被日本人民挫败以后，昨天又决定要在5月10日以前强使众议院通过这项侵略性军事同盟条约。
    日本首相岸信介昨天召集自由民主党岸信介派的五十五名国会议员开会，讨论了国会批准这个条约的问题。岸信介在会上强调说，批准修改后的日美“安全条约”是他的政府面临的最重要的课题。他说，“我们务必使这个条约在这次国会会期内获得通过。”
    岸信介的亲信、自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎进一步解释说，自由民主党决心要尽一切可能在5月10日以前使众议院通过新“安全条约”。
    岸信介和川岛正次郎都要求这些议员们“加强团结”，实现他们的阴谋。
    在这以前，川岛还曾经透露，岸信介集团为了要在本届国会会期内使这个条约得到批准，正在准备延长国会会期。
    据报道，岸信介集团不顾日本公众和舆论的强烈反对如此急迫地要使国会及早通过这个条约，同美国总统艾森豪威尔预定在6月19日访问日本一事有关，岸信介希望在那时能够向美国总统“献礼”。
