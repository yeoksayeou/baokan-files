    Ode to the Dragon Horse
    Yang Shuo
    We are living in the Mao Zedong era. What is the spiritual characteristic of this era? It is worth pondering repeatedly.
    I just made a short trip to the Zhangjiakou area. Wherever I went, I felt that life was like the spring mist evaporating from the mountains and fields, rising vigorously and full of youthful vitality. Of course, what I saw was only a small projection of our era, but from these projections, perhaps we can also reflect the spiritual face of this era.
    Let life itself speak.
    I arrived in Yu County. This small ancient city is located on the mountain pass of the Taihang Mountains in western Hebei. During the Liberation War, the people suffered under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Countless days and nights, they painfully looked at the vast and boundless southern mountains, hoping that one day the People's Liberation Army could cross the southern mountains and rescue them from their suffering. In the early spring of 1948, I followed the People's Liberation Army over the southern mountains and set foot on this scarred land. Now, twelve years later, it is early spring again. Returning to the old place, I feel that everyone, every mountain, every tree, is very familiar, yet not familiar at all. What used to be a desolate valley is now, whether it is a plain or a slope, meticulously cultivated into fields, so exquisite and so symmetrical, that from a distance, they look like bolts of corduroy. And in this remote plain, the people have also opened coal mines and built cement plants, paper mills, and fiberboard factories. ... What's especially interesting is the excavation of underground water in the southern mountains. The southern mountains have always lacked water. Wells could not be dug, and the farmers at the foot of the mountains had to drive their little donkeys several miles to carry water to have anything to drink. Otherwise, they had to drink the yellow and smelly rainwater stored in the mud pits, which the local farmers called "mahuang water." Without water, crops naturally could not be grown well. The most famous white hemp in Yu County Plain could not be grown at the foot of the southern mountains. In fact, the southern mountains do not lack water, it just seeps into the ground and does not flow out. Since the Great Leap Forward, the farmers of the commune began to excavate underground water, along the important passages of the southern mountains, such as Beikou, Jiugongkou, and Songzikou, everywhere they started working together. I specifically ran to Beikou to take a look. The underground water had already been dug out, a clear, shimmering expanse, like a small lake. The water also had to be diverted out of the mountains, so the farmers opened mountains and dug tunnels, creating a tunnel more than 1,000 meters long. In a few days, the underground water could pass through the tunnel, gushing torrentially into the channels, and flowing all the way to Yu County.
    The farmers who were opening the mountain were resting, some squeezed into the ventilation room, warming themselves around a stove of coal fire. The secretary of the construction site's branch, He Cai, was nearly forty years old, and had served as the instructor of the district militia during the war, fighting guerrillas around the southern mountains. I was eager to know the detailed process of digging underground water, and asked He Cai to talk about it. He Cai squatted in front of the coal fire, and after a few hurried words, he changed the subject, saying excitedly: "You wait and see, once this water comes out of the mountain, Yu County Plain will be another place. For all eternity, we will never have to worry about water again."
    I wanted to pull the topic back a little, and asked: "Did you encounter any difficulties in digging underground water!"
    He Cai said: "There were some, but once we overcame them, they were gone. Did you see that we are building a power station below? Once the water is released, we will have electricity, and every household will be brightly lit. For all eternity, we will never have to worry about darkness again. Hey, hey, just think about what that will be like!" Saying this, He Cai laughed, and the farmers listening nearby also laughed.
    I noticed that "for all eternity" was He Cai's favorite phrase. What he was most concerned about was indeed the cause of all eternity. Yesterday has passed, today will become yesterday, and tomorrow is infinitely grand. When I realized that our people were actually living in an ideal tomorrow, my heart trembled a little.
    Isn't that so? If you don't believe it, please meet Liang Rong, an electrician from Yantong Mountain in the Longyan Iron Mine. Before arriving at Yantong Mountain, I had heard about the various miracles created by the workers. Once I arrived, what I saw with my own eyes was even more amazing than what I had heard. I saw a winch, the machine brake and controller were all dismantled. The door of the machine room was locked, completely unattended, only a small wooden box was installed on the utility pole next to the road, with a few buttons on it. Whoever needed the winch, would press a button, and the winch's steel cable would automatically go up and down to transport ore. I also saw a blower and a compressor, both machine rooms were tightly locked, the windows were tightly nailed with oil felt, which looked strange and desolate, but the machines were running day and night. It turned out that a control panel was installed in another compressor room, which could be used to control the machines in these three machine rooms simultaneously with buttons. Originally, thirty people were required to manage the three machine rooms in rotation every day, but now only three people were needed, which was more than enough. It saved people, saved trouble, and improved efficiency countless times, wasn't it a miracle. The person who created these miracles was the ordinary electrician Liang Rong.
    Liang Rong was only thirty-one years old, thin and quiet. He told me how he pondered and worried when he was studying how to automate these machines, how he couldn't sleep at night, and how he stood beside the machines in his clothes, racking his brains. I asked him why he did this, and he smiled faintly and said: "Why? For the sake of communism."
    It is this glorious and brilliant ideal that inspires our people, so that everyone can take big strides together, thinking of ways to use the highest speed to sprint towards the ideal. Look, from the countryside to the city, from the factory to the mine, everywhere is flourishing, really like ten thousand horses galloping, with a myriad of phenomena. In the Zhangjiakou area, as long as one is a little careful, one will often find that workers or farmers have a small piece of red cloth pinned on their left chest, with the words "Race Athlete" written on it. Whoever thinks that this is really an athlete on the sports field is joking. This is actually a uniquely designed racing sports meet held on the production front, and everyone who participates sets their own production targets, and whoever can complete them on time is considered to have won the championship. In this vigorous competition, everyone wants to strive for first place, win the championship, and rush forward, showing a very strong sense of honor. They want honor, but not the kind of personal honor, but collective honor. This is fully demonstrated in the actions of Zhang Zhenwang, a miner from Pangjiabao in the Longyan Iron Mine.
    Zhang Zhenwang is still very young, with delicate eyebrows and eyes, and very capable. He is smart and willing to study, and is best at the tricks of drilling holes and blasting, so the mining progress is much higher than ordinary people, so he is called the "God of Blasting." The leaders saw that he was capable and asked him to help others. He did not hide his technical experience at all, and wholeheartedly promoted the progress of the backward miners, so that the records of others were also constantly rising. When he heard that there was a red flag fast tunneling team, whose mining performance had far surpassed him, he couldn't stop smiling. Of course, he was also working hard in his heart, determined to keep moving forward and keep up. It is not difficult to understand Zhang Zhenwang's mood. What he loves is not selfish personal honor. If someone can surpass him and create greater achievements, winning greater honor for the proletariat, as a member of the proletariat, he also feels honored. Zhang Zhenwang is like this, and how many other advanced figures are not like this.
    This is our people. They have the noble qualities of communism, and are willing to dedicate their greatest strength and make the most outstanding contributions for the ideal of tomorrow. I think this is the most prominent spiritual characteristic of the Mao Zedong era. Dear comrades, do you think so?
    On the way from Zhangjiakou to Yu County, I passed a fortress. On the wall of the fortress gate was a colored painting, a precious horse carrying extremely precious wealth, its four hooves soaring into the air, galloping forward. The title of the painting was "Dragon Horse Carrying Treasure." I felt that the meaning of the painting was fresh, so I wrote this "Ode to the Dragon Horse" to praise our people who are galloping like dragon horses.

    我们正生活在毛泽东时代。什么是这个时代的精神特色呢？值得反复深思。
    我刚刚到张家口一带作了一次短短的旅行，足迹到处，只觉得生活好似漫山漫野蒸发着的春雾，腾腾上升，充满青春的生命力。当然，我看见的，只不过是我们时代的一些小小的投影，但从这些投影里，或许也能反映出这个时代的精神面貌吧。
    且让生活本身出来说话。
    我到了蔚县。这个不大的古城坐落在河北西部太行山脉的山口上。当年解放战争时期，人民受着国民党反动派的压榨，不知有多少白天和黑夜，苦痛地望着那片莽莽苍苍的大南山，盼望解放军有一天能从南山翻过来，把他们从苦难中拯救出来。1948年初春，我就是随着解放军翻过南山，踏到这片千疮百孔的土地上来的。现在相隔十二年，又是初春，旧地重来，我觉得每个人，每座山，每棵树，都十分熟悉，可又一点都不熟悉。早先是一片荒凉的山谷，今天不管是平川或是坡地，田亩都经过细心的翻耕，那么精致，那么匀称，远远一看，好像一匹一匹展开的灯芯绒一样。而在这偏僻的川原上，人民还开起煤矿，建起水泥场、造纸场、纤维板场。……尤其有意思的是挖掘南山的地下水。南山历来缺水，打井也打不出水，山脚下的农民得赶着小毛驴跑到几里外去驮水，才能有吃的，否则就得喝烂泥坑里存的又黄又臭的雨水，当地农民叫做“麻荒水”。水缺，庄稼自然种不好。蔚县川最有名的白麻，南山脚也无法种。其实南山的水并不缺，只是都渗到地下，流不出。大跃进以来，公社的农民开始挖掘地下水，沿着南山的重要孔道，像北口、九宫口、松子口，到处一齐动手。我特意跑到北口看了看。地下水早已挖出，碧粼粼的一片，好似一湾小湖。还得把水引出山，农民就开山凿洞，打成一条一千多米长的隧道。过不了几天，那地下水就可以穿过山洞，滚滚滔滔涌进渠道，一直流到蔚县城。
    开山的农民正在歇息，有些人挤到风机房里，围着一炉子煤火取暖。施工所的支部书记叫何财，将近四十岁，当年担任过区小队的指导员，围着南山打游击。我极想知道挖掘地下水的详细经过，请何财说说。何财蹲在煤火跟前，潦潦草草谈不几句，话头一转，兴高彩烈地说：“你等着瞧吧，这水一出山，蔚县川就会是另一个样儿。万世千秋，再也不愁水了。”
    我想把话头稍微往后拉一拉，问道：“挖地下水该遇到些困难吧！”
    何财说：“有是有，一克服，又没有了。你看没看见，我们正在下头修发电站，一放水，有了电，村村户户亮堂堂的，万世千秋，再也不愁黑夜了。哎，哎，你想想，那时候该是个什么样儿呢？”说着，何财笑了，旁边听的农民也笑了。
    我注意到，“万世千秋”是何财爱用的口头语。他最关心的也确实是万世千秋的事业。昨天已经过去，今天就要变成昨天，明天才是无限远大的。当我觉察到我们的人民竟是生活在理想的明天里，我的心都震动得有点儿发颤。
    难道不是这样么？不信请再会一会龙烟铁矿烟筒山的电工梁荣。没到烟筒山之前，先就听说工人们创造出种种奇迹。一到，亲眼看见的竟比耳闻的还要新奇。我看见一台绞车，机器闸和控制器都拆了。机房的门挂上锁，根本无人管，只在路旁电线杆子上装着个小木头盒儿，上头有几个电钮。谁要用绞车，一按电钮，绞车的钢绳便会自动上下，搬运矿石。我又看见一台抽风机和一台压风机，两座机房都紧锁着，窗上严严实实地钉着油毡，显得怪荒凉的，机器却在日夜转动。原来在另一间压风机房里装着个控制盘，可以用电钮同时控制这三间机房的机器。本来每天要三十人轮流管理三个机房，现在只需三个人便绰绰有余了。又省人，又省事，效率提高不知多少倍，岂不是奇迹。创造这些奇迹的便是普普通通的电工梁荣。
    梁荣才三十一岁，生得瘦伶伶的，举动挺安静。他告诉我他在钻研使这些机器自动化时，怎样焦思苦虑，夜晚睡不着觉，披着衣裳站在机器旁边苦捉摸。我问他为什么要这样，他淡淡一笑说：“为什么？为的是共产主义嘛。”
    正是这种光辉灿烂的理想鼓舞着我们的人民，大家才一齐放开大步，想尽方法用最高的速度，向着理想飞奔。你看吧，从农村到城市，从工厂到矿山，到处蓬蓬勃勃，真是万马奔腾，气象万千。在张家口一带，一个人只要稍微细心点，准会时常发现工人或者农民的左胸上钉着一小块红布，上写着“赛跑运动员”的字样。谁要以为这真是体育场上的运动员，那才笑话呢。这其实是生产战线上举行的一次别出心裁的赛跑运动会，参加的人都订出自己的生产指标，凡是能按期完成的，都算夺得冠军。在这场轰轰烈烈的竞赛当中，每个人都想争第一，夺冠军，争先恐后，表现出极强烈的荣誉感。他们要荣誉，要的不是那种个人的荣誉，而是集体的荣誉。这从龙烟铁矿庞家堡的矿工张振旺的行动中就充分地显现了出来。
    张振旺还很年青，生得眉眼细致，十分精干。人聪明，又肯钻，最擅长打眼放炮的诀窍，采矿的进度比一般人高出许多，因此都叫他神炮手。领导上见他有能耐，叫他去帮助别人。他丝毫不隐藏自己在技术上的心得，实心实意地推动落后的矿工前进，使别人的纪录也在不断上升。当他听说有个红旗快速掘进队，采矿的成绩远远赶到他前头去，他乐的闭不上嘴。当然，他心里也在使劲，定要不断前进，紧追上去。想懂得张振旺的心情，并不难。他爱的不是自私的个人荣誉。有人能超过他，创造出更大的成绩，为无产阶级争得更大的荣誉，作为无产阶级的一员，他也感到光荣。张振旺是这样，许许多多先进的人物又何尝不是这样。
    这就是我们的人民。他们具有高贵的共产主义的品质，都愿意为着明天的理想献出自己最大的力量，做出最出色的贡献。我看，这也就是毛泽东时代最突出的精神特色。亲爱的同志们，你说是不是呢？
    从张家口去蔚县的路上，路过一座堡子，堡子大门的墙上画着幅彩画，一匹宝马驮着极珍贵的财富四蹄腾空，飞奔向前。题的字是“龙马驮宝”。我感到画意新鲜，因而写成这篇“龙马赞”，赞颂我们像龙马一般飞奔的人民。
