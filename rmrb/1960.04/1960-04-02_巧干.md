    Ingenious Labor
    By our reporters Peng Xianglin, Huang Shengpu, and Li Jinting
    In the newly reclaimed virgin land, early rice seeds have sprouted, the rape and green manure fields are a tapestry of color, and neatly plowed paddy fields are dotted with piles of dark, soaking fertilizer, filling people with confidence in this year's agricultural harvest.
    The busy spring plowing season has arrived in the Wuji People's Commune in Hengshan County, Hunan Province. Strangely enough, the number of people working in the fields is no more than in previous years, but why is the spring plowing preparation work so outstanding?
    After several days of visiting, we found an answer: ingenious labor.
    The responsible comrades of the Commune Party Committee said: Since the mass tool reform movement was launched last year, the whole commune has created and imitated 73 kinds of new tools, and more than 50,000 pieces have been promoted and used, which is equivalent to increasing more than 2,500 laborers. Last winter, thanks to the use of indigenous machinery for water conservancy construction, 108 small and medium-sized reservoirs and more than 700 ponds and dams were built in only 45 days, which is five times more than the water conservancy projects built in the past ten years. Now, each mu of land has accumulated 1,500 dan of fertilizer, an increase of 1,000 dan over previous years. The plowing and harrowing of the fields has also been done twice, with two plowings and two harrowings. In addition to planting on the original wasteland, 18,000 mu of new wasteland has been reclaimed, as well as afforestation, road construction, and river channel construction. The commune members all say: "Tool reform has given this place millions of hands." This sentence is not wrong at all.

        The Cart Triumphs Over the Carrying Pole
    In this commune, a prominent impression is that no one uses carrying poles to transport goods anymore. Everywhere on the field roads and hillside paths, you can see single-wheeled, three-wheeled, and four-wheeled carts, including handcarts, ox-drawn carts, indigenous trains, winch carts, and skidding carts….... The women of the Tianli Production Team use handcarts that can carry four dan of fertilizer at a time. When these carts reach the edge of the field, the person turns around, presses the cart shafts downward with both hands, and the wheels slide out and up like a scorpion raising its tail, turning the handcart into a mud boat, transporting the fertilizer directly to the manure pits in the field. People call this cart a "dual-purpose amphibious live-wheel cart," with a load capacity of 400 jin, which increases work efficiency two to three times compared to shoulder carrying and can transport 160 dan of fertilizer to the fields per day.
    Speaking of this cart, it reminds people of last December, when everyone used carts to deliver fertilizer. When they arrived at the edge of the paddy fields, they still had to use carrying poles to carry it down to the fields. Old farmer Cao Shiqing stroked his beard and said: "I must build a fertilizer cart that can go up mountains and down to the fields." With the support and help of the Commune Party Committee, a "Zhuge Liang Meeting" with carpenters and old farmers was held. Skilled craftsmen were eager to try and racked their brains. Guo Junman, a carpenter from the Longshan Production Brigade, drew diagrams all night and, after many experiments, finally made this amphibious cart that could go up mountains and down to the fields. The next morning, he ran to the Commune Party Committee to report the good news. When he saw that the two-wheeled carts made by the other fourteen production teams had also been sent in, everyone said that the amphibious live-wheel cart made by Guo Junman was the best after an on-the-spot competition. It was also rated as the best at the county's new tool competition and was quickly promoted and used throughout Hengshan County.
    Putting down the carrying pole and pushing the cart can be said to be a remarkable change in the Wuji Commune. Before 1958, people here rarely saw carts. Later, when there were some carts, people were not used to using them, and there was even a story of a competition between "carrying poles and carts." The women of the Tianli Brigade were the first to learn how to use carts, but some male commune members did not believe that carts were stronger than carrying poles and elected two strong men, Xie Shunsheng and Chen Dingsheng, to compete with the women: the same distance, the same time, the cart transported 160 dan of fertilizer a day, while the carrying pole only carried 40 dan. The two strong men were exhausted and had back pain, but the women were light and easy with the carts and not very tired. The carrying pole was defeated by the cart. Now, the cart has become everyone's treasure. Commune members Cao Xuelan and his wife are both good laborers, and they have three handcarts. Old farmer Cao Youting took out coffins that had been stored for two or thirty years and made a cart for each of his six sons, and also donated materials for four carts so that more people could use carts. The whole commune has more than 6,800 handcarts, achieving one cart per laborer. The whole commune has also built several hundred ox carts. People say that carts can turn a semi-laborer into a strong laborer and one laborer into three laborers.

        No More Using Rake Heads to Turn Manure Pits
    The manure pits soaked in the fields need to be turned. In the past, turning the pits was done by one person using a rake head. This year, they are two people operating a large rake with two blades connected together that is six feet long. Like pulling a saw, back and forth, a manure pit that is two zhang long, six feet wide, and more than one foot deep can be turned in just three or four minutes. It looks very light and requires little effort. Two people operating can turn more than 200 large manure pits a day. In the past, using a rake head to turn manure pits? At most, only 20 or so could be turned in a day.
    This year, there is several times more fertilizer than in previous years. The commune members are happy on the one hand and worried on the other. They are happy that more fertilizer can increase production, but they are worried that they will not be able to turn it all over with rake heads. Zhao Hengshi, the Party General Branch Secretary of Danjiachong Brigade, and carpenter Rang Zhihua had an idea. They discussed trying to make a fast manure-turning device, so they moved a harrowing rake and had one person control the rake while the other pulled it with a rope. It was indeed faster than a small rake head to turn the manure pits, but it was not convenient to use. They then connected the two rakes together and turned them by hand. After many improvements, the results were very good, but using iron rake teeth was not cost-effective. Later, they changed to bamboo rake teeth. On the day when it was officially put into field trials, people happily ran to see it. Since then, the manure-turning device has become a popular item. Thanks to the use of manure-turning devices throughout the commune, the manure pits covering more than 30,000 mu of paddy fields have been turned four times. This innovation alone has saved the whole commune more than 136,000 labor days.

          Animal-Powered Water Station
    On the banks of the rivers, harbors, and streams of this commune, there are small thatched sheds with the words "Animal-Powered Water Station" written on them. Inside, an ox pulls a turntable, driving several waterwheels to rotate, and streams of clear water are poured into the fields. When you get closer, you see that the ox is driven by an old woman doing needlework or a child carrying a book. The animal-powered water station was a product of the drought resistance last year. At that time, most of the labor force of the whole commune was concentrated on drought resistance, and no one was taking care of other work. Carpenter Ding Guisheng saw the scene of the commune members fighting day and night to draw water and also saw that the cattle were idle and had nowhere to use them, so he used the revolving wheel of the rope traction machine to make an ox-drawn turntable waterwheel. The ox pulled the wheel to turn in the wheel plate. At first, because it took up a lot of space, it could not be moved, and it could not be installed by the stream. The turntable was made smaller, and the ox turned outside. In this way, the wheel plate had fewer teeth and did not turn fast, and the work efficiency was not high. He pondered day and night, even putting his chopsticks in the shape of a turntable while eating to study it, and finally came up with installing a small side wheel on the edge of the large wheel plate, which accelerated the speed. The ox-drawn waterwheel was successful and could irrigate 13 mu of land a day. The whole commune made 78 ox-drawn waterwheels, saving more than 200,000 labor days for drought resistance last year and ensuring a comprehensive harvest at the same time. Now the ox-drawn waterwheel has started to turn again, pouring water into the fields.

      "Not Too Busy" During the Spring Plowing Season
    The things about ingenious use of new tools in the spring plowing of Wuji Commune are really endless. In addition to the above-mentioned items, there are also ox-drawn fertilizer spreaders for spreading fertilizer; plowing fields has an improved double-wheel double-plow plow, which increases work efficiency more than four times compared to the old plow; harrowing fields has a three-purpose harrow, which originally required three passes, but now only one pass is needed; in addition to rice transplanters, rice seedling pullers are used instead of manual rice seedling pulling; there are also field ridge smoothing devices for leveling field ridges; there are ash dotting devices instead of manual ash dotting; there are spray boats instead of people carrying sprayers on their backs; there are four-wheeled horizontal and vertical cultivators instead of manual weeding. In terms of processing agricultural and sideline products, there are hydraulic automatic rice mills and oil presses. In pig farms and public canteens, semi-mechanization has also been achieved.
    Although it is a busy spring plowing season, the commune members do not feel too tired because they are working cleverly. Everyone here is in good spirits, and everyone is talking and laughing. When resting in the fields, people either write poems or songs, or take out books from their pockets to study culture. The situation of working hard into the night is gone. Every night, after dinner, the commune members automatically come to the "three-in-one" Red and Professional spare-time school of politics, technology, and culture to study. The whole commune has formed 134 scientific and technological research groups, with more than 1,000 people participating. Because technical innovation and cultural revolution promote and influence each other, the whole commune has trained more than 320 industrial technicians, more than 2,100 agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery technicians, and more than 1,100 commune and team financial management talents. People now say: "If production is busy, it will be even busier without culture; if we want 'four modernizations,' we can't modernize without culture!"

            A New Generation
    Along the sandbar on the riverbank, a group of young women are busy "transplanting rice." When you get closer, you see that they are practicing rice transplanting with clusters of pine needles. It turns out that this is the "classroom" where the commune trains rice transplanter operators. The whole commune plans to train 1,500 rice transplanter operators, and nearly 1,000 have been trained so far. Chen Qiuye, a female commune member from Jinghuaqiao Brigade, is a 16-year-old girl. As early as after the Spring Festival, when the water in the fields was frozen, she participated in the study of using rice transplanters. She forgot to eat and forgot to rest, and she learned it in just two days. She also learned to use deep plows, learned to push carts, and learned a total of 24 agricultural production techniques and mastered the use techniques of 16 new tools in two years, becoming a new generation of farmers in the countryside.

    巧干
    本报记者　彭香林　黄生谱　李进挺
    在新开垦的处女地里，早稻种子发芽了，油菜田和绿肥田里，一片锦绣，一冲又一冲翻犁好的水田里布满了黑浸浸的肥料堆，使人们对今年农业丰收充满了信心。
    湖南衡山县吴集人民公社的春耕生产大忙已经来到了。真奇怪，田里劳动的人并不比往年多，而春耕准备工作为什么做得特别出色？
    几天的访问，使我们找到了一个答案：巧干。
    公社党委负责同志说：自从去年开展群众性的工具改革运动以来，全公社创造、仿制的新工具有七十三种，推广使用的共五万多件，这就等于增加了二千五百多个劳动力。去年冬天，由于使用土机械修水利，只四十五天，就修起中小型水库一百零八座，塘堰七百多座，比过去十年修的水利工程多五倍。现在每亩田已积肥一千五百担，比往年增加了一千担，田里的犁耙工夫，也做到两犁两耙，原来荒田荒土种上不算，还新开荒一万八千亩，以及造林、修公路、修河道等。社员们都说：“工具改革使这里人增加了千百万双手。”这句话一点也不错。
        车子战胜了扁担
    在这个公社里，给人一个突出的印象是，再没有人用扁担挑运物品了；在田间大道和山坡小路上，到处可以见到独轮、三轮、四轮车子，有手推车、牛拉车、土火车、绞盘车、滑道车………。田力生产队妇女们使用的手推车，一次可以装运四担肥料，这种车子到了田边，人一转过身，两手把车辕朝下一压，车轮就像蝎子翘尾巴一样滑出来、翘上去，手推车变成了拖泥船，把肥料直接运送到田间粪凼里。人们称这种车子是“水陆两用活轮车”，载重四百斤，比肩挑提高工效两三倍，一天可运一百六十担肥料下田。
    说起这部车子，就使人回想起去年12月间，大家用车子送肥，运到水田边，还要再用扁担挑下田去。老农曹时青捋着胡子说：“我一定要造一部能上山、能下田的运肥车。”在公社党委的支持帮助下，一个有木工和老农参加的诸葛亮会召开了，能工巧匠们个个磨拳擦掌，苦思苦想。龙山生产大队木工郭俊满连夜画图，经过多次试验，终于制成了这部能上山能下田的水陆两用车。第二天一早他跑到公社党委报喜，一看其他十四个生产队制的两用车也送来了，经过当场比武，大家都说郭俊满造的这部两用活轮车最好，在全县新工具比武会上也评为第一，很快就在衡山全县推广使用了。
    放下扁担，推起车子，这在吴集公社可以说是一件很了不起的变革。1958年以前，这里的人很少见过车子，后来有了一些车子，人们开始不习惯使用，还发生过“扁担和车子”比赛的故事。田里大队的妇女最先学会了用车子，但一些男社员不相信车子比扁担强，推选出谢顺生和陈丁生两个大汉子和妇女比赛：同样的距离、时间，用车子一天运肥一百六十担，人挑只挑了四十担。两个大汉子累得腰酸背痛，妇女们用车子却轻轻快快，并不很累。扁担被车子战胜了。现在，车子已经成了人们的随身宝，社员曹雪兰夫妇俩都是好劳动，他俩人就有三部手推车；老农曹用廷拿出存放了二、三十年的棺木，给六个儿子每人做了一部车子，还献出四部车子的材料，让更多的人用上车子。全公社仅手推车就有六千八百多部，做到了每个劳动力人手一车。全公社还造了几百部牛车。人们都说车子能使半劳动力变成强劳动力，一个劳动力变成三个劳动力。
        不再用耙头翻凼
    沤在田里的凼子该翻了。过去，翻凼都是一个人用耙头翻。今年，他们是两个人操纵一架两张连在一起的有六尺长的大耙，像拉锯一样，一来一往，两丈长、六尺宽、一尺多深的粪凼，只要三、四分钟就翻完一个。看起来挺轻巧，费力不大；两人操作，一天能翻二百多个大粪凼。过去用耙头翻凼呢？一天最多只翻得二十多个。
    今年，肥料比往年多了好几倍，社员们一则喜，一则愁，喜的是肥料多了能增产，愁的是用耙头翻不过来。淡家冲大队党总支书记赵恒仕和木工穰治华动了心思，他们商量要试制一种快速翻凼器，于是搬来一张耙田的耙，一边由一人掌握耙，一边用绳拉，翻凼确比小耙头快，但使用不方便；他们又把两张耙连到一起用手掌握着翻，经过多次改进，结果很好，就是用铁耙齿不合算，后来又改成竹耙齿，等正式下田试用的那天，人们都欢天喜地的跑来看。从此翻凼器成了人人喜爱的东西，全公社由于使用翻凼器，布满三万多亩水田的粪凼已翻了四次，这一项革新，全社就节省劳动日十三万六千多个。
          畜力水车站
    在这个公社的河、港、小溪边，都有一座座小茅棚，茅棚上写着“畜力水车站”几个大字。里面一头牛拉着一架转盘，带动几部水车转，一股股清水灌进了田。走近看时，赶牛的不是带着针线做活的老婆婆，就是带着书本的小孩子。畜力水车站是去年抗旱时的产物。那时，全公社大部分劳力集中抗旱，其他工作没人管。木工丁桂生看到社员为了车水日夜苦战的情景，又看到耕牛闲着没处使用，他就利用绳索牵引机的转轮，做成了牛拉转盘水车，牛在轮盘内拉着转，起初因占的地方大，不能移动，小溪边不能安装；又把转盘改小，牛在外边转，这样轮盘齿少，转得不快，工效不高。他日夜琢磨，连吃饭也把筷子摆成转盘钻研，终于想出了在大轮盘边安装一个小侧轮，这样就加快了转速。牛拉水车成功了，一天可灌田十三亩。全公社做了七十八部牛拉水车，去年节省抗旱劳动日二十多万个，同时保证了全面丰收。现在牛拉水车又开始转动起来，向田里灌水了。
      春耕季节“不太忙”
    吴集公社在春耕中巧用新工具的事情，真是看不尽说不完。除了上面说过的几件以外，还有撒粪用的牛拉撒粪器；犁田有改良式双轮双铧犁，它比旧犁提高工效四倍多；耙田有三用耙，原来耙三道，现在一道就行了；除了插秧机，还用拔秧器代替手工拔秧；整田塍也有田塍荡光器；有点灰器代替手点灰；有喷雾船代替人背喷雾器；有四轮横直中耕器代替人力?田。农副产品加工方面，有水力自动碾米厂、油榨坊，在养猪场和公共食堂里，也都实现了半机械化。
    虽然是紧张的春耕季节，但社员们由于干得巧，并不感到太劳累，在这里人人精神舒畅，个个谈笑风生，在田里休息的时候，人们不是作诗作歌，就是从口袋里掏出书本学文化。连夜苦干的情况没有了，每到晚上，社员们吃过饭都自动地来到政治、技术、文化“三合一”的红专业余学校学习。全公社组成了一百三十四个科学技术研究小组，有一千多人参加。由于技术革新和文化革命互相促进，互相影响，全社已培养出工业技术人员三百二十多名，农林牧副渔的技术人材二千一百多人，社队财务管理人材一千一百多人。人们现在都说：“生产忙，没有文化会更忙；要‘四化’没有文化就化不了啊！”
            新的一代
    顺着河岸的沙洲上，一群女青年正在忙着“插秧”，走近一看，她们是在用一蔸蔸松针，练习插秧，原来这是公社训练插秧机手的“课堂”。全社计划训练的一千五百名插秧机手，现在已训练出近千名。荆花桥大队女社员陈秋芽，是十六岁的姑娘，早在春节过后，田里水结了冰，她就参加了使用插秧机的学习，她忘记了吃饭，忘了休息，只两天就学会了。她还学会了使用深耕犁，学会了推车子，两年里共学会了二十四种农业生产技术，掌握了十六种新工具的使用技术，成了农村中新的一代农民。
