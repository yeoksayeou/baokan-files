Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 16th: According to a report by the German News Agency, masses in several West German cities including Hamburg, Bremen, Hanover, and Braunschweig began their "Easter March" yesterday and today to protest West German atomic armament. This is the first long-distance demonstration by the West German people against atomic armament. The marching groups will converge on Bergen-Hohne in Lower Saxony on April 18th, and then hold a mass protest rally. Bergen-Hohne is the place where the West German army launched its first American "Honest John" missile last year, which can be equipped with nuclear warheads.

In Bremen, more than 150 people participated in this anti-atomic armament demonstration yesterday despite heavy rain. The slogans they held read: "Training in the use of atomic weapons is training in mass slaughter!" "Germany does not want atomic weapons!" In Hamburg, more than 200 people also participated in the demonstration despite the pouring rain. Participants included members of the Conscientious Objectors Association, the War Resisters' International, "Friends of Nature," and youth organizations of the Social Democratic Party. Hamburg police authorities attempted to obstruct and disrupt the marching group at the start, but were unsuccessful. When the marching group reached Lower Saxony, the authorities even dispatched a large number of police cars to follow them.

In Hanover and Braunschweig, the masses began demonstrating this morning. Before the marching group departed in Braunschweig, a West German pastor spoke to the masses, demanding that West Germany completely abandon all atomic war preparations, and especially called on West German youth to rise up against atomic armament.

    反对西德原子武装
    西德群众举行“复活节进军”
    新华社柏林16日电　据德意志通讯社报道，汉堡、不来梅、汉诺威和不伦瑞克等几个西德大城市的群众分别在昨天和今天开始了抗议西德原子武装的“复活节进军”。这是西德人民第一次举行反对原子武装的长途示威游行。游行队伍将在4月18日在下萨克森州的贝根—霍内地方汇合，然后举行群众抗议大会。贝根—霍内是西德军队去年发射第一个可以装上核弹头的美国“诚实的约翰”式导弹的地方。
    在不来梅有一百五十多人昨天冒着大雨参加这次反原子武装示威。他们举着的标语牌上面写道：“训练使用原子武器就是训练大规模屠杀！”“德国不要原子武器！”在汉堡，也有二百多人不顾滂沱大雨，参加了示威。参加者包括拒绝服兵役者联合会、反对为战争服役者国际组织、“自然之友”和社会民主党青年组织的成员。汉堡的警察当局在游行队伍出发时曾经企图进行阻挠和破坏，但是没有成功。当游行队伍到达下萨克森州时，当局竟出动大批警车跟踪游行队伍。
    在汉诺威和不伦瑞克，群众是从今天上午开始示威的。在不伦瑞克的游行队伍出发以前，一个西德牧师向群众讲了话，他要求西德完全放弃一切原子战争准备，并且特别号召西德青年们起来反对原子武装。
