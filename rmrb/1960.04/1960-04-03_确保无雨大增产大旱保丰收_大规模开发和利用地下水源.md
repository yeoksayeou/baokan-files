To ensure a bumper harvest without rain and guarantee a harvest in severe drought
Large-Scale Development and Utilization of Underground Water Sources

    (Reported by this newspaper) The development and utilization of underground water resources in Gansu Province has proven to be one of the most effective measures for combating drought in current agricultural production. Now, the abundant clear water, which has been lying dormant in the depths of the earth for thousands of years, is being widely and extensively extracted to irrigate farmland affected by drought. As of March 15th, the province had used underground water to irrigate 670,000 mu of farmland, and underground water was being used to irrigate another 2.4 million mu.

    Since last winter and this spring, Gansu has experienced scarce rainfall and snowfall. In order to ensure "a bumper harvest without rain and guarantee a harvest in severe drought," the entire province, from the Longdong Plateau to the Hexi Corridor, from the Longnan mountainous area to the Tengger Desert, is engaged in large-scale development and utilization of underground water. By late March, the movement gradually reached its climax. Currently, over 280,000 wells have been dug and over 380,000 springs have been excavated throughout the province. Over 250,000 laborers have been投入into this movement. They are working day and night in the mountains and river valleys, searching for water sources, digging serial wells, intercepting subsurface flows, and creating a whole set of methods tailored to local conditions to turn underground water to good account. Due to the significant differences in Gansu's geographical conditions, rainfall, climate, water sources, and degree of drought, the experiences created by the people of Gansu in this regard are particularly worthy of attention.

    On the Loess Plateau at an altitude of 1,500 meters, the people of Dongzhiyuan have created methods such as open channels and hidden tunnels to divert water from the plateau, connecting multiple wells in series for centralized pumping, and digging plum blossom-shaped large wells. In just a few months, they have built 170,000 wells and dug open channels and hidden tunnels with a total length longer than the Great Wall, forming a magnificent underground river network, breaking the superstition that "it is difficult to dig wells because the plateau is high and the water level is low" which had existed for thousands of years. In the Hexi Corridor, where underground water sources are relatively abundant, people are digging sunken ponds in areas with high water levels, digging open channels in swampy areas to intercept subsurface flows, and drilling artesian and semi-artesian wells in areas with higher water heads, comprehensively tapping underground water sources. Minqin County launched a movement to dig ten thousand sunken ponds, and the result was that every pond had water. Maolin Brigade of Sanlei Commune dug a sunken pond with an area of ten mu, which expanded the irrigation area by more than 1,000 mu. The Yuejin Brigade of Chijin Commune in Yumen City, located on the Gobi Desert, drilled 170 artesian and semi-artesian wells, increasing the cultivated land from more than 400 mu to more than 2,200 mu, all of which became irrigated land. In the arid hilly areas of central Gansu, underground water is mainly concentrated in dry ancient riverbeds. Therefore, people are digging open the riverbeds, building underground dams transversely to intercept subsurface flows, and then building channels to divert irrigation, or drilling deep wells in these areas. Jinping People's Commune in Dingxi County intercepted nine subsurface flows, which expanded the cultivated area by 12,000 mu. Yangwayao, located in the ravines between several large mountains, obtained a water volume that could only be raised by a 20-horsepower water pump by drilling a deep well. The above situation shows that Gansu Province is extremely rich in underground water resources, which can be developed and utilized almost everywhere. It also proves that the people of Gansu, in their long-term practice of fighting against the natural disaster of drought, have become familiar with the laws of underground water, and are therefore fully capable of fully developing and utilizing it.

    As early as 1950, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to develop and utilize underground water, but some people believed that Gansu was arid, underground water was scarce, and even if water was dug out, it would not be of much use. They had never taken a positive attitude towards the development and utilization of underground water. In response to this thinking, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party committees at all levels have been conducting ideological struggles and, at the same time, selecting areas for pilot projects. From 1950 to 1952, focusing on the Hexi Corridor, people were sent to Shahebao in the former Linze County to drill artesian wells and to build Huanzhi Canal in Minqin County, gaining experience in drilling artesian wells and intercepting and diverting underground water in the Hexi Corridor. After 1953, focusing on the arid areas in central Gansu, two conferences were held in the arid areas in central Gansu, and deep wells and serial wells were experimentally drilled in Zhuangziping, Baiyin City, the most arid area, and sweet water wells were experimentally drilled along the Kushui River in Dingxi, gaining experience in drilling deep water wells and sweet water wells in the arid areas in central Gansu. After 1956, experiments were conducted in Yongchang, Minqin and other counties to penetrate impermeable layers, discovering the second and third layers of confined water, and gaining experience in developing deep underground water. All of this extensive and arduous work has prepared the ideological and material foundations for the large-scale development and utilization of underground water throughout the province this year. The superstition of the "no underground water theory" has been broken, and the way to obtain underground water has been found, which has promoted the movement to tap underground water to sweep across the province rapidly, opening a new chapter for Gansu's water conservancy cause.

    Now, the people of Gansu are striding forward towards the goal of completing one million wells and 500,000 springs throughout the year, improving and increasing the irrigation area by eight million mu. (Wang Tiqiang)

    确保无雨大增产大旱保丰收
    大规模开发和利用地下水源
    本报讯　甘肃省的开发和利用地下水运动，已经证明是当前抗旱生产中最有效的措施之一。现在，蕴藏丰富的、千万年来一直闲置在地层深处的清清流水，正在广泛而大量地被引提出来，灌溉受到旱灾侵袭的农田。到3月15日，全省已利用地下水灌溉农田六十七万亩，正在利用地下水灌溉的农田还有二百四十多万亩。
    去冬今春，甘肃雨雪稀少。为了确保“无雨大增产，大旱保丰收”，全省从陇东高原到河西走廊，从陇南山区到腾格里沙漠，到处都在大规模地开发和利用地下水。到3月下旬，运动逐渐形成高潮。目前，全省已打井二十八万多眼，挖泉三十八万多处。全省投入这个运动的劳动力已达二十五万多人。他们日夜出没在山川河谷之间，寻水源，打串井，截潜流，因地制宜地创造出一整套叫地下水大翻身的方法。由于甘肃的地理条件、雨量、气候、水源和干旱程度的差异很大，因此，甘肃人民在这方面所创造的经验也就特别值得重视。
    在海拔一千五百米的黄土高原上，董志塬的人民创造了明渠暗洞、引水出原，多井串连、集中抽水，打梅花大井等方法。在短短的几个月里，一举修成了十七万眼井和挖了总长度比万里长城还要长得多的明渠暗道，组成了一幅壮观的地下河网，打破了几千年来“原高水低难打井”的迷信。在地下水源比较丰富的河西走廊，人们在水位高的地方挖潜塘，在沼泽地区挖明渠截潜流，在水源水头较高的地区打自流井和半自流井，综合挖掘地下水源。民勤县开展了挖万座潜塘运动，结果塘塘有水。三雷公社茂林大队挖了一座面积十市亩的潜塘，即扩大灌溉面积一千多亩。地处戈壁滩上的玉门市赤金公社跃进大队，打自流井和半自流井一百七十眼，使耕地由四百多亩扩大到两千二百多亩，并且全部变成水地。在中部干旱丘陵山区，地下水主要集中在干涸的古河床。于是人们挖开河床，横向筑地下坝，拦截潜流，然后修渠引灌，或者就在这些地方打深井。定西县锦屏人民公社拦截潜流九处，即扩大耕地面积一万二千亩。位于几座大山的沟岔之间的阳洼窑，打了一台深井，就获得了一台二十匹马力抽水机才能提起的水量。上述情况表明，甘肃省的地下水资源十分丰富，几乎到处都可开发利用。同时也证明，甘肃人民在同干旱的自然灾害斗争的长期实践中，已经熟悉地下水的规律，从而完全能够充分的开发和利用。
    远在1950年，中共甘肃省委就提出要开发和利用地下水，但是由于有些人认为甘肃干旱，地下水很少，即使打出了水也不顶事。他们对开发和利用地下水一直不是抱着积极的态度。针对这种思想，中共甘肃省委、各级党委不断进行思想斗争，同时，选择地区试点。1950年到1952年，以河西走廊为重点，先后派人在原临泽县沙河堡打自流井，在民勤县修筑环志渠，取得了在河西走廊打自流井和截引地下水的经验。1953年以后，以中部干旱地区为重点，两次召开中部干旱地区会议，在最干旱的白银市庄子坪试验打深井和串井，在定西苦水河沿岸试验打甜水井，取得了中部干旱地区打深水井和甜水井的经验。1956年以后又在永昌、民勤等县试验穿过不透水层，发现第二层和第三层承压水，取得了开发深层地下水的经验。所有这些大量而艰巨的工作，恰好为今年在全省范围内大规模地开发和利用地下水运动准备了思想上和物质上的基础。“地下无水论”的迷信破除了，怎样取得地下水的门道找到了，这就促使挖掘地下水运动，迅速漫卷全省，为甘肃的水利事业揭开了新的一页。
    现在，甘肃人民正昂首阔步向着全年完成一百万眼井，五十万处泉，改善和增加灌溉面积八百万亩的目标迈进。　（王体强）
