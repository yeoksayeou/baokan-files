Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, as well as the work report on the CPPCC Standing Committee by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and I will resolutely implement them in future work.

Our steel company began construction on July 1, 1958, amidst the nationwide great leap forward in industry and agriculture. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, under the leadership of the Central Committee and the provincial, regional, and municipal Party committees, and with the support of the people of the whole country, all our employees displayed soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, enabling construction to advance at high speed and realizing continuous great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959. In just over a year, enterprises such as the machine repair plant and power plant were completed.

Our steel company is a newly established enterprise with a weak foundation, starting from scratch and lacking experience. We faced certain difficulties in all aspects, including raw materials, machinery, equipment, and manpower. We are victoriously advancing in accordance with the Party's guiding principles of launching vigorous mass movements, relying on our own efforts, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and walking on two legs. Based on the requirements of high-speed construction and the actual situation, we broke the "conventional" construction procedures and adopted the "four simultaneous" approach of designing, preparing, constructing, and producing at the same time.

In order to accelerate the construction progress, ensure the quality of the project, and save manpower and materials, all the employees of our company promoted the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, and launched a massive technical innovation and technical revolution, achieving great results. Taking the joint processing plant where I work as an example, this plant is responsible for the processing and manufacturing of building materials such as steel bars, concrete, and other prefabricated components for the entire company. In the past, manual operation and heavy physical labor accounted for a considerable proportion. Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the Party, we have launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement with mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation as the core. In just over two months, the steel bar workshop has realized mechanized shaping, mechanized straightening and cold drawing, and mechanized transportation; the mixing workshop has realized mechanized sand pushing, stone washing, material loading, and mixing, and mechanized transport of carts on tracks; all the workers have thrown away carrying poles, baskets, and shovels, and the original 300 people in the entire workshop are now sufficient with only 50 people. The stone washing section used to operate manually, requiring 160 laborers to wash 100 cubic meters of stone each time. Now, using a set of linkage lines for stone lifting, stone washing, screening, and loading, made with indigenous methods, only four to five people are needed, increasing work efficiency by 33 times and greatly improving working conditions. This year, our plant's task has increased twofold, and we guarantee that we will not increase personnel and will complete the annual state plan ahead of schedule.

In order to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and equipment, all employees of our company displayed a tenacious spirit of hard work, relying on our own efforts, combining indigenous and foreign methods, making do with whatever was available, and manufacturing raw materials, equipment, and machinery ourselves. When there was no cement and calcium carbide, we burned them ourselves; when there were no electrodes, we made them ourselves. We successively built a large number of small satellite plants on the construction site, such as small blast furnaces, small coke ovens, and cement plants, thereby solving part of the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. Our cement plant started with only a few small earthen kilns and not a single technician. After more than a year of exploration and expansion, it has now developed into a semi-mechanized cement plant with a daily output of 100 tons.

While vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, we paid special attention to the issue of comprehensive utilization. For example, sawdust, wood scraps, shavings, broken straw ropes, etc., have all become useful materials. We process these things into sawdust boards, wood wool boards, shaving boards, and straw boards, which are used in factory building construction, which is both beautiful and practical, and economical. We have also successfully manufactured new technologies such as prestressed concrete components, wet-ground slag, concrete components, and thin-shell arched panels, which have saved steel and ensured project quality.

When our broad masses of employees were enthusiastically carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, a small handful of right-leaning opportunists launched an attack on us, slandering our high-speed construction as not conforming to "construction procedures" and that engaging in innovation was "not attending to one's proper duties." Under the leadership of the Party, we not only withstood this cold wind, but also thoroughly shattered the attacks of the right-leaning opportunists with ironclad facts. The revolutionary enthusiasm and creative wisdom of our broad masses of employees has been brought into even greater play, and the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is rolling forward in waves.

The construction and production achievements of our company in the past year and more are the victory of the Party's three magic weapons and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. We must better study Marxism-Leninism, study Chairman Mao's works, continuously improve our political consciousness and Marxist-Leninist level, never be satisfied, and forever advance victoriously along the road guided by the Party and Chairman Mao.

The employees of our company will never fail the expectations of the Party and the people of the whole country. We resolutely guarantee to achieve monthly red, quarterly red, red to the end, and full-year overall red, and complete the state plan ahead of schedule.

Finally, I wish the conference victory and the committee members good health!

### 我们的钢铁公司在高速前进  黄德茂委员的发言

    我们的钢铁公司在高速前进
    黄德茂委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告，以及陈叔通副主席关于政协常委会的工作报告，并坚决在今后工作中贯彻执行。
    我们的钢铁公司是在全国工农业大跃进的形势下，1958年7月1日开工兴建起来的。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在中央和省、地、市委的领导下，在全国人民的支援下，我们全体职工发挥了冲天的革命干劲，使建设高速度地前进，实现了1958年和1959年的连续大跃进。仅仅一年多的时间里，就建成机修厂、动力厂等企业。
    我们的钢铁公司是一个新建企业，底子薄，平地起家，缺乏经验，不管在原材料、机具、设备、人力等各方面，都有一定的困难。我们遵照着党指示的大搞群众运动、自力更生、勤俭办企业、两条腿走路的方针，胜利前进。我们从高速度的建设要求和实际情况出发，打破了建设程序的“常规”，采取了边设计、边准备、边施工、边生产的“四边”方针。
    为了加速建设进度，保证工程质量，节约人力和物力，我们公司全体职工发扬了苦干、实干和巧干的精神，大闹技术革新和技术革命，取得了很大的成绩。就拿我所在的联合加工厂来说，这个厂担负着全公司的钢筋、混凝土和其他预制构件等建筑材料的加工制造任务，过去手工操作和笨重体力劳动占着相当大的比重。今年年初以来，我们在党的领导下，开展了以机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化的技术革新和技术革命运动，两个多月的时间，钢筋车间实现了成型机械化、矫正冷拉化、搬运车子化；搅拌车间实现了推砂、洗石、上料、搅拌机械化、运输车子轨道化；工人全部扔下了扁担、抬筐、铁锹，全车间原来三百人，现在五十人就够了。洗石工段过去用手工操作，每次洗石一百立方米需要劳动力一百六十人，现在用土法制成一套起石、洗石、过筛、装车的联动线，仅用四至五人就够了，提高工效三十三倍，并大大改善了劳动条件，今年我厂任务增加两倍，我们保证人员一个不增，还要提前完成全年国家计划。
    为了战胜原材料和设备不足的困难，我们公司全体职工发挥了顽强的艰苦奋斗的精神，自力更生，土洋结合，因陋就简，自己动手制造原材料和设备、机具。没有水泥和电石就自己烧，没有电极就自己造。我们先后在工地上建起了小高炉、小焦炉、水泥厂等一大批小型卫星厂，从而解决了一部分原材料不足的困难。我们的水泥厂开始时只有几个小土窑，没有一个技工，经过一年多的摸索、扩建，现在已发展成为一个日产百吨的半机械化水泥厂了。
    在大闹技术革新和技术革命的时候，我们特别注意了综合利用问题。比如锯末、碎木、刨花、破稻草绳等，都成了有用的材料，我们把这些东西加工制做成锯末板、木丝板、刨花板、稻草板，用在厂房建筑上，既美观实用，又经济。我们还制造成功预应力混凝土构件、湿碾矿渣、混凝土构件、薄壳拱形板等新技术，节省了钢材，保证了工程质量。
    在我们广大职工热火朝天地大闹技术革新和技术革命的时候，一小撮右倾机会主义分子向我们展开了进攻，诬蔑我们高速度建设不合乎“建设程序”，搞革新是“不务正业”。我们在党的领导下，不但顶住了这股冷风，并且以铁一般的事实，彻底粉碎了右倾机会主义分子的进攻。我们广大职工的革命干劲和创造智慧更加高度发挥，技术革新和技术革命运动正在一浪高一浪地滚滚向前。
    我们公司一年多来的建设和生产成就，是党的三大法宝的胜利，是毛主席思想的胜利。我们一定要更好地学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席著作，不断提高自己的政治觉悟和马克思列宁主义水平，永不满足，永远沿着党和毛主席指引的道路胜利前进。
    我们公司的职工决不辜负党和全国人民的期待，我们坚决保证实现月月红、季季红、红到底、全年满堂红，提前完成国家计划。
    最后，祝大会胜利，祝委员们身体健康！
