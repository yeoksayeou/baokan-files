Exchanging Technical Information to Promote Technological Revolution
Liaoning Technical Information Network Spreads Throughout the Province

(Our newspaper, Shenyang, 31st dispatch) Liaoning Province has universally established a scientific and technological information network, systematically collecting and disseminating the technical innovations of individuals, departments, and regions in a timely manner, helping the broad masses to master and utilize them, thereby generating greater effects.

This information network was established to coordinate with the province-wide mass technological innovation movement. In the past, due to a lack of information, many new technologies with universal significance appearing in various departments were unknown to others and were limited to application within a small scope for a long time. Some technical issues had already been resolved by advanced departments, while other departments were still organizing their own forces to experiment from scratch, wasting a lot of time, manpower, and materials. To change this phenomenon of mutual disconnection, industrial, agricultural, school, and scientific research departments throughout the province have all selected specialized personnel and established information organizations. So far, the province has achieved the establishment of comprehensive information centers in provinces, cities, and counties; professional information centers have been established in various industries; and grassroots information groups, information officers, or part-time information officers have been established in major factories, mines, enterprises, universities, scientific research departments, and some people's communes, ensuring that wherever there are technical activities, there is information collection work. In order to coordinate and cooperate, close liaison systems have been established between information organizations at all levels, actively providing and requesting information from each other, and assisting each other in querying and collecting materials, forming an information network with interconnected channels throughout the province.

Liaoning's technical information organizations at all levels are currently collecting basic data for the long-term technical development plans of various departments through more than ten forms, such as publishing express reports, exchanging magazines, exhibiting materials, technical demonstrations, academic report meetings, and on-site meetings. At the same time, with the greatest effort, they are disseminating new experiences emerging in the technological innovation movement to various sectors of the national economy to achieve the current leap forward plan. Recently, the Liaoning Technical Information Institute collected and compiled 3,864 technical data items, most of which are related to comprehensive resource utilization and agricultural technology transformation. Each data item indicates the source, purpose, utilization method, and effect. During the exhibition period, 481 production and research departments found 2,861 kinds of data that could solve the current key problems of their departments, avoiding a lot of repetitive labor. The Shenyang Grain Management Department spent a long time trying to develop a wave-based temperature and water measuring instrument for proper grain storage but failed. After visiting the available data in Dalian and Lushun, they successfully trial-produced it. The Aluminum and Magnesium Design Institute had been struggling for several years to deal with fluorine-containing wastewater. Through information exchange with other regions, they obtained relevant Soviet data, saving the experimental process.

In the process of collecting, sorting, and disseminating information, Liaoning's information organizations at all levels pay great attention to following the mass line, so the information sources are broad and the exchange is fast. Most of the information officers in small and medium-sized enterprises and people's communes are technical personnel and veteran workers in production positions, who can report the new creations of their departments to higher-level information agencies at any time. The information organization of the Andong County Iron and Wood Factory, led by the Party branch secretary, organized workers who could draw and transcribe to quickly sort out the information of 843 new agricultural implements and tools created by the factory since the Great Leap Forward, and exchanged them with fraternal factories. The information agencies of large factories, mines, and scientific research departments have organized the technical personnel of their units to do information work. On the one hand, they mobilize them to translate and sort out valuable domestic and foreign data at hand, and at the same time, they often assign them to appraise, summarize, and report the creations and inventions of their units.

### 互通技术情报　促进技术革命  辽宁技术情报网遍及全省

    互通技术情报　促进技术革命
    辽宁技术情报网遍及全省
    本报沈阳31日电　辽宁省普遍建立起科学技术情报网，有组织地把一个人、一个部门、一个地区的技术创造，及时搜集起来，传播出去，帮助广大群众掌握运用，从而产生更大的作用。
    这个情报网是为配合全省群众性的技术革新运动建立的。过去由于情报不灵，各部门出现的不少具有普遍意义的新技术，别人不知道，长期来仅限于小范围内应用；有些技术课题，先进部门早已解决了，其他部门还在各自组织力量从头试验，浪费了大量时间、人力和物力。为了改变这种互不通气的现象，全省工业、农业、学校和科学研究部门，都抽调了专门力量，建立了情报组织。到目前为止，全省已经做到省、市和县都建成了综合性的情报中心；各行业都建成了专业性的情报中心；主要厂矿企业、大专学校、科学研究部门和部分人民公社都建立了基层情报组、情报员或兼职情报员，作到了哪里有技术活动，那里就有搜集情报的工作。各级情报组织之间，为了配合协作，建立了密切的联系制度，互相主动提供和索取情报，互相代为查询和搜集资料，形成了全省脉络相通的情报网。
    辽宁各级技术情报组织，目前正通过出版快报、交换杂志、展览资料、技术表演、学术报告会、现场会议等十多种形式，又广、又快、又精、又准地为各部门长远的技术发展规划搜集基础资料，同时以最大的力量，为国民经济各部门实现当前跃进计划，传播技术革新运动中出现的新经验。最近辽宁技术情报研究所搜集整理的三千八百六十四项技术资料，大部分是有关资源综合利用和农业技术改造方面的，每一项资料都注明了出处、用途、利用方法和作用。这些资料在展出期间即有四百八十一个生产和研究部门，找到了二千八百六十一种能解决本部门当前关键问题的资料，避免了大量重复劳动。沈阳粮食管理部门为了妥善的保管粮食，花很长时间也没有研究成功的电波检温测水仪，这次参观了旅大的现成资料，试制成功了。铝镁设计研究院对含氟污水的处理，已悬了几年没有解决，通过和外地情报交流，取得了苏联有关资料，节省了试验过程。
    辽宁各级情报组织，在搜集、整理和传播情报中，十分注意走群众路线，因而情报来源广，交流快。中小企业和人民公社的情报员，大都是生产岗位上的技术人员和老工人兼职的，他们能随时把所在部门的新创造，报告给上级情报机构。安东县铁木厂的情报组织，由党支部书记领导，组织能绘图誊写的工人，利用业余时间，很快便将大跃进以来本厂创造的八百四十三种新农具、新工具的资料整理起来，和兄弟厂作了交换。大厂矿和科学研究部门的情报机构，都组织了本单位技术人员作情报工作，一方面发动他们把自己手头有价值的国内外资料翻译整理出来，同时经常分配他们把本单位的创造发明进行鉴定、总结报道出去。
