Comrades, Chairman, and fellow representatives:

    After listening to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Financial Statement and the 1960 National Budget Draft," as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, I express my heartfelt support and guarantee to resolutely implement them in my future work.

    These reports have given me a profound socialist education, making me see more clearly the great victories and glorious achievements that the country has already achieved. Not only have we completed the production targets of the major industrial and agricultural products of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, but we also have the full possibility of catching up with and surpassing the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in a shorter time than ten years, and we can also realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. All these great achievements are the great victory of the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the great victory of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party, resolutely implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction and launching mass movements on a large scale.

    The socialist construction of our great motherland has entered a new stage. In order to realize the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1960, the people of the whole country are making amazing achievements with high morale and revolutionary vigor, and a new situation of rapid progress is emerging on all fronts. We are moving from great victory to newer victories, which is completely worthy of being the greatest honor and pride of our people.

    Our Heilongjiang Province, like other parts of the country, has undergone earth-shaking changes in the past decade since the founding of the People's Republic, especially since the Great Leap Forward. Taking Harbin City as an example, in the old society, it was a consumer city. The so-called industry only had a few oil mills and flour mills, and a few small iron factories that could only do some minor repairs. There was no talk of manufacturing any machinery. In terms of commerce, there was speculation and profiteering, and the corrupt and backward situation was simply unbearable. After liberation, in these short ten years, this backward consumer city that could only produce oil, wine, rice, and flour has been built into a new major industrial city of our country with the machinery industry as its center and a relatively developed scientific culture. When we see these great achievements, we deeply realize that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China. This is an absolute truth.

    The great situation of the new form, new stage, and new tasks in our province is an unprecedented speed towards mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation with the new upsurge of technological innovation and technological revolution. Now, everywhere in our province, we can see automatic production lines and automated single machines. The manual operations of the past have become automated, and manual handling has become mechanical towing and pneumatic suction. The emergence of production automation and mechanization has greatly improved labor productivity, improved the working conditions of workers, shortened the production process, and powerfully promoted the sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward. The countless amazing miracles created by the broad masses of working people in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement have set a good example for us industrialists and businessmen to learn from.

    Under this great situation, in the past year or so, industrialists and businessmen in our province, like those in other parts of the country, under the leadership of the Party, and inspired by the Great Leap Forward and the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and influenced by the soaring revolutionary spirit of the working class, have made relatively significant changes in their political thought and their attitude towards the socialist path. The main manifestations are: Many people are more willing to get close to the Party and obey the leadership of the Party, and to ask the Party for instructions and report their thoughts. Many people have gradually come to understand from the country's Great Leap Forward and the development and changes in enterprise production that the Party is the fundamental core of leadership in all undertakings. Only by earnestly accepting the leadership of the Party can they have reliance, direction, methods, and a future. They have more confidence in the leadership of the Party, and therefore, they have further approached the Party. Regarding the issue of learning from the working class, because most of our industrialists and businessmen have participated in various forms of labor during the Great Leap Forward, and through labor practice, they have personally seen the working class's love for the Party, their love for the socialist cause, and their soaring enthusiasm. They have rich experience and infinite wisdom in their actual work, and they are always at the forefront of any work, leaving difficulties to themselves and making things easy for others. At the same time, they also realize that any achievements they make are inseparable from the help of the workers. Therefore, the erroneous thinking of looking down on workers has been transformed, and many people have expressed their willingness to learn from the working class. In terms of active service, many of our industrialists and businessmen have invested in the production increase and economy practice movement, and many have made certain achievements. In Harbin alone, 1,735 people were named red-banner pacesetters of the city, district, and enterprises in the fourth quarter of 1959. Some family members of industrialists and businessmen have also stepped out of their homes during the Great Leap Forward and participated in street work and social activities, and some activists have emerged. This is a great improvement compared to the past. After the conclusion of the National Congress of the Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, our provincial party committee attached great importance to this. The Democratic National Construction Association organizations and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce in various cities and counties are conducting communication under the leadership of the local party committees. The local party committees attended the meetings and gave cordial instructions, which were enthusiastically supported by the vast number of industrialists and businessmen, greatly boosting their morale. Everyone's actions were also relatively rapid, and they were combined with the central tasks of the local associations and enterprises. While holding meetings, they communicated to the masses, and while completing plans, they formed a vigorous situation in which meeting communication and action reports were intertwined.

    The important instruction of Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the Central Committee of the Party, namely, that industrialists and businessmen should "take care of one end," taking care of the interests of the country and the people, and "lean to one side," leaning towards socialism. After hearing the communication, they deeply felt the care and consideration of the Party for industrialists and businessmen, which was truly meticulous, and they expressed their willingness to repay the Party's kindness with practical actions. Therefore, many people realized that taking the socialist road, personal interests and collective interests are consistent. As long as we resolutely follow the Party, take the socialist road, accept transformation wholeheartedly, and serve socialism, we will have a bright and happy future. The future of the people of the whole country is also the future of our industrialists and businessmen. As long as we industrialists and businessmen take care of one end, that is, wholeheartedly serve socialism, we will have that end, that is, the end of personal interests. As long as we can take care of one end and lean to one side, the Party and the government will take care of and guarantee those living problems to the end. Everyone was greatly moved by this issue. Everyone unanimously believed that the Party's care and consideration for industrialists and businessmen had actually been guaranteed long ago, and it was not just starting now. For example, the processing and ordering carried out before joint ventures had certain profits; the factual clearing of assets at the time of joint ventures still gives generous interest; people are used according to their talents and are properly taken care of; and various convenient opportunities and conditions are given to enable industrialists and businessmen to study and improve themselves. Isn't this already guaranteed? As some people said, "The Party really takes care of us at home. In the future, we can only take care of one end and lean to one side, and make achievements with practical actions to repay the Party's meticulous care." At the same time, many people also realized that in a socialist country, if they hang on to both ends, are uneasy, and calculate personal gains and losses everywhere, putting personal interests above collective interests and disregarding overall interests, personal interests cannot be achieved. As long as we act resolutely in accordance with the correct direction pointed out by the Party, take care of one end, and lean to one side, we can control our own destiny, and both ends will surely be there. After the communication, because everyone's understanding has been improved, new actions have also appeared in actual work. Most people's work, study, and participation in labor have been more active than in the past. For example, under the leadership of the Party, industrialists and businessmen in Harbin City originally planned to put forward 200,000 rationalization proposals in the first quarter, including 5,216 technological innovation projects. After communicating the report, they quickly overfulfilled the task, and the quality was also high. Industrialists and businessmen in Daowai District alone put forward 24 automatic production lines, 16 of which have already been realized. For another example, in order to welcome the convening of the communication meeting, private personnel and technicians from the Qunli Machinery Factory in Harbin City worked hard for three days and nights and successfully trial-produced a quality inspection instrument, increasing work efficiency by 45 times. For another example, after the promotion of the new situation and listening to the communication, all the private personnel of the waste product purchasing station in Daowai District completed the original plan of putting forward 21,745 rationalization proposals at the end of February ten days ahead of schedule and exceeded it, implementing 7,124 items, and successfully trial-produced local and foreign-combined power ordering machines, silent mechanized foreign iron products, power double-knife shoe machines, waste newspaper painting machines, etc. Some areas have also set off a challenge and response campaign between people and enterprises with production increase and economy practice as the content, and they have presented gifts to the provincial party congress. This is the positive side. While affirming our achievements, we must also realize that, at present, there are still many fundamental problems among our industrialists and businessmen. The main manifestations are: measuring by the requirements of accepting the leadership of the Party, listening to the Party wholeheartedly, following the Communist Party wholeheartedly, and telling the Party the truth, there is still a considerable distance. Many people still have more or less doubts and precautions, and they still believe or disbelieve the Party's policies and lines. Many people still cannot tell the Party the truth, especially when conflicts arise with personal interests, it is especially easy to waver and resist. For example, some people said, "When talking to the Party, you must always leave three points, for fear of saying something wrong and revealing your weakness, which may cause the Party's distrust." Some people in the technological revolution movement are unwilling to cooperate with the workers, holding a resistant attitude of "wanting to show off" and "I am better than you"; some people still have the idea of "I am the head" towards the three red banners, and they plan for themselves everywhere. Some people have a wrong understanding of the continuous Great Leap Forward, and they say, "It is okay to have red seasons and red months, but red days are too stressful." A few industrialists and businessmen also have different degrees of ideological concerns about the people's communes. Regarding the issue of continuing to accept socialist transformation, many people still lack the necessary understanding, showing a sense of weariness and resistance towards transformation. Some people also show a sense of weariness towards learning. For example, some said: "Work is so busy, everyone should take a break, what are we still studying?"

    The above facts show that the estimates of the National Congress of the Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce on our industrial and commercial circles are completely correct, and they are in line with the actual situation of great progress in our industrial and commercial circles. However, this is only in comparison with our past. Compared with the working class's love for the Party, their love for socialism, and their soaring enthusiasm, and compared with the requirements of the current new situation, we are still far behind. At the same time, we can see that there are still some fundamental problems. Although, on the whole, the capitalist side has decreased and the socialist side has increased, it has not progressed to the point where the majority of people have solved or basically solved the political stance. The duality still exists. Therefore, we must still carry out fundamental transformation of our political stance in order to better serve socialism.

    Fellow representatives, our great motherland, in all aspects and undertakings, is in a Great Leap Forward. Under the leadership of the Party, and under the call of the peaceful transformation policy, we industrialists and businessmen must resolutely accept transformation wholeheartedly and serve society wholeheartedly. On the basis of great progress, we will more actively invest in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, better transform ourselves, and strive to make more contributions to socialist construction.

    工商业者要自己掌握自己的命运
    刘珮芝代表谈黑龙江工商业者的自我教育主席、各位代表：
    我听到了李富春副总理的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”及全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告后，我表示衷心拥护，保证在今后的实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    这些报告使我受到一次极为深刻的社会主义教育，使我更清楚地看到了国家已经取得了的伟大胜利和党的光辉成就，不仅提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的工农业主要产品的生产指标，而且完全有可能用比十年更短的时间在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国，又能提前实现全国农业发展纲要。所有这些巨大成就，都是党和毛主席英明领导的伟大胜利，是全国人民在党的领导下，坚决贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，大搞群众运动的伟大胜利。
    我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设，已经进入了一个新的阶段，全国人民为了实现1960年持续大跃进，正以斗志昂扬，意气风发的革命干劲作出惊人成就，在各个战线上都呈现了日新月异，飞跃前进的新局面，并且正从伟大的胜利走向更新的胜利，是完全值得我们全国人民引以为最大光荣而骄傲的。
  我们黑龙江省和全国各地一样，建国十年来，特别是大跃进以来，发生了翻天复地的变化。仅以哈尔滨市来说，在旧社会是一个消费城市，所谓工业仅有几家制油厂，面粉厂，有几家小铁工厂，只能做些零修碎补，根本谈不到制造什么机器；在商业方面是投机倒把，买空卖空，那种腐朽落后的情景，真是不堪言状。解放以后，在这短短的十年多来，把这个过去只能生产油、酒、米、面落后的消费城市，已经建设成为我们国家的一个以机械工业为中心、科学文化比较发达的新兴的主要工业城市了，当我们看到这些伟大成就，深深的体会到没有共产党，就没有新中国，这是千真万确的事实。
  目前我省新形势，新阶段，新任务的伟大局面，是以技术革新和技术革命的新高潮，空前未有速度向机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化进军。现在我省到处都可以看到生产自动线、自动化单机，过去的手工业操作变为自动化了，人力搬运变为机械拖带风力吸运了等等。由于出现了生产自动化，机械化，大大提高了劳动生产率，改善了工人的劳动条件，缩短了生产过程，有力地推动了持续的全面的大跃进。广大的劳动人民在技术革新和技术革命运动中数不胜数的惊人奇迹，给我们工商业者，树立了良好的学习榜样。
    在这样伟大形势下，一年多来，我省工商业者也和全国各地一样，在党的领导下，在大跃进和党的八届八中全会的鼓舞下，在工人阶级的冲天革命干劲影响下，在政治思想上和走社会主义道路上，有了比较显著的变化。主要表现在：许多人比较愿意靠近党与服从党的领导，向党请示工作，汇报思想了。许多人从国家的大跃进中，从企业的生产发展变化中，逐渐懂得党是领导一切事业的根本的根本，核心的核心，只有认真的接受党的领导，才能有依靠，有方向，有办法，有前途。对党的领导是比较信服了，因而进一步地向党靠拢了。对向工人阶级学习的问题，由于在大跃进中，我们工商业者的多数人都参加各种不同的劳动，通过劳动实践，亲眼看见工人阶级热爱党、热爱社会主义事业和冲天干劲，在实际工作中有丰富的经验和无穷的智慧，任何工作都是走在前面，把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人，同时还体会到我们自己做出的任何成绩都是和职工的帮助分不开的，因此看不起工人的错误思想有所转变，许多人表示愿意向工人阶级学习了。在积极服务方面，我们工商业者，许多人都投入了增产节约运动，有不少人还作出了一定的成绩，仅哈尔滨在1959年第四季度就有一千七百三十五名被评为市、区、企业的红旗手。有些工商业者家属在大跃进中还走出了家门，参加了街道工作和社会活动，还出现了一些积极分子。比过去有很大进步。民建和全国工商联的代表大会结束后，我们省党委对此非常重视，各市、县的民建组织和工商联，正在当地党委的领导下，进行传达，各地党委都到会作了亲切的指示，得到了广大工商业者极为热烈的拥护，大大鼓舞了工商业者的情绪。大家的行动也比较迅速，都与本地本会企业的中心任务结合起来，一面开会，一面往群众中传达，一面完成计划，形成了开会传达与行动报捷交织到一起的一个轰轰烈烈的局面。
    党中央刘少奇副主席的重要指示，即要工商业者“顾一头”，顾国家和人民利益这一头，“一边倒”，倒向社会主义。听到传达之后，
  深深的感到党对工商业者的关怀和照顾，真是无微不至，纷纷表示要以实际行动来报答党的恩情。因此许多人认识到，走社会主义道路，个人利益和集体利益是一致的。我们只要坚决跟党走，走社会主义道路，一心一意接受改造，为社会主义服务，是完全有光明幸福的前途的。全国人民的前途，也就是我们工商业者的前途。我们工商业者只要顾一头，即全心全意为社会主义服务，就会有那一头，即个人利益那一头。我们只要能顾一头，一边倒，那些属于生活上的问题，党和政府都是照顾到底，包到底的。大家对这个问题，受到很大的感动。大家一致认为党对工商业者的关怀照顾，其实早就包了，不是现在才开始包。如在合营前进行的加工订货，都有一定的利润；合营当时实事求是的清产核资，至今仍给予优厚的利息；对人是量才使用，适当照顾；并给各种方便机会与条件，使工商业者学习来提高自己，这不是早就包干了吗？如有的人说“党对我们真是照顾到家了，今后只有顾一头、一边倒，以实际行动作出成绩来报答党的无微不至的关怀”。同时许多人还认识到在社会主义国家，如果心挂两头，七上八下，处处计较个人得失，把个人利益放在集体利益之上，不顾整体利益，个人利益是搞不到的。我们只要按党所指出的正确方向，顾一头，一边倒，坚决这样作下去，就能掌握自己的命运，两头都一定有的。在传达后，由于大家的认识提高了，因而在实际工作中也出现了新的行动，多数人的工作，学习，参加劳动，比过去有了积极的表现。例如哈尔滨市的工商业者，在党的领导下，原计划在第一季度提出合理化建议二十万件，其中技术革新项目五千二百一十六件，通过传达报告很快就超额完成了，并且质量也较高，仅道外区的工商业者，就提出生产自动线二十四条，现在已经实现十六条。再如哈尔滨市群力机械厂，私方人员、技术人员为了迎接传达会议的召开，苦战三昼夜，试制成功了质量检查仪，提高工作效率四十五倍。又如道外区废品收购站的全体私方，在新形势的推动和听了传达之后，把原计划在2月末提合理化建议二万一千七百四十五条，提前十天完成并已经超过，落实七千一百二十四条，并试制成功了土洋结合的电力制订机，洋铁制品无声机械化，动力双刀制鞋机，废报纸刷色机等等，有的地区，还掀起了人与人，企业与企业以增产节约为内容的挑战应战，纷纷向省党代会献礼，这是积极的一面。我们在肯定成绩的同时，还必须要认识到，从目前来说，我们工商业者还存在着不少带有根本性的问题。主要是表现在：对接受党的领导，以一心一意听党的话，一心一意跟共产党走，向党说真心话的要求来衡量，还有相当距离，许多人还存在着或多或少的疑虑和戒备，对党的方针政策、路线还是时信时疑，半信半疑。许多人还不能向党说真心话，特别是和个人利益发生矛盾时，尤其容易发生动摇和抵触。如有的人说：“对党说话总要留三分，怕说错了露了马脚，可能引起党的不信任。”还有的人在技术革命运动中，不愿意和职工合作，抱着“要露一手”，“我比你们强”的抵触态度；对三面红旗，有些人还存在着“我字当头”的思想，处处为个人打算。有的人对持续大跃进，有错误的认识，并说“季季红，月月红还可以，日日红太紧张了”。少数的工商业者，对人民公社也有程度不同的思想顾虑。对继续接受社会主义改造问题，有不少人还缺乏应有的认识，表现出厌倦改造和抵触情绪。也有些人对学习表现出厌倦情绪。如有的说：工作这么忙，大家应该歇一歇，还学习啥等等。
    以上事实说明，民建，工商联两会全国代表大会，对我们工商业界的估计是完全正确的，是符合我们工商界大有进步的实际情况。不过这只是和我们过去比较而言，要和工人阶级的热爱党，热爱社会主义和他们的冲天干劲来比，以及和当前新形势的要求相比，我们还是相差很远的。同时可以看到我们还存在一些带有根本性的问题。虽然从总的来说资本主义一面减少了，社会主义一面增多了，但是并没有前进到多数人解决了或者基本上解决了政治立场的地步，两面性仍然存在的，因此我们还必须进行脱胎换骨的政治立场的根本改造，才能更好的为社会主义服务。
    各位代表，我们伟大的祖国，各方面，各项事业，都在大跃进，我们工商业者在党的领导下，在和平改造政策的感召下，我们坚决要一心一意接受改造，一心一意为社会服务。在大有进步的基础上，更加积极地投入到社会主义建设的大跃进中去，更好的改造自己，争取在社会主义建设中做出更多的贡献。
