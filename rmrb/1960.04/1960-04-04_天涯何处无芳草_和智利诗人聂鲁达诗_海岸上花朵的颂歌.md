Where Can't One Find Fragrant Grass
A Poem in Response to Chilean Poet Neruda's "Ode to the Flowers on the Coast"
Huang Yanpei

    I.
    I love the people of Chile,
    I love the people's poet of Chile.
    Where on earth is there no fragrant grass?
    Where in the world is there no poetic material?
    The darkness and light of politics,
    The people's suffering and joy, hunger and fullness,
    All will arouse the people's poet's passionate cries and laughter.
    People's poet!
        We have been apart for so long.
    Such a long time!
    Such a long distance!
    But you and I share the same heart.
    What heart? The flower heart of a "rose,"
    Equally "joyful" and "simple."

    II.
    I love the people's poet of Chile,
    I love the poems of the people's poet of Chile.
    "Love and responsibility,"
    In your mind,
    In my mind,
    Form the mutual yearning between you and me.
    The winds and waves of the vast ocean,
    Cannot sever the threads of affection between you and me.
    People's poet!
    The socialism, communism, that we idealize!
    When you and I shake hands again on that day,
    I hope,
    I believe,
    It will be when all the people of the world jointly enjoy happiness.

    天涯何处无芳草
    和智利诗人聂鲁达诗“海岸上花朵的颂歌”
    黄炎培
    一
    我爱智利的人民，
    我爱智利的人民诗人。
    天涯何地没有芳草？
    人间何地没有诗料？
    政治的黑暗和光明，
    人民的苦和乐、饥和饱，
    都会惹起人民诗人热情的啼和笑。
    人民诗人啊！
     我们久别了。
    那么长的时间！
    那么远的路程！
    但是，我和你是一颗同样的心。
    什么心？是“玫瑰”的花心，
    同样地是“愉快”是“单纯”。
    二
    我爱智利的人民诗人，
    我爱智利人民诗人的诗。
    “爱和责任”，
    在你脑海里，
    在我脑海里，
    结成你我两人的相思。
    大海洋的风浪，
    隔断不了你我两人的情丝。
    人民诗人啊！
    我们所理想的社会主义，共产主义！
    到那一天你我再度握手时，
    我希望，
    我相信，
    是全世界人民共同享受幸福之时。
