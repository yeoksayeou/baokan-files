At the National Militia Representative Conference, there was an "Old Eighth Route Army" who was both a militia battalion commander and the principal of a commune's amateur red-and-expert school. His name was Li Bingbi, and his chest was covered with more than twenty gleaming gold medals. He came from Nan Cheng Village in the Taihang Mountains.

Li Bingbi joined the Eighth Route Army at the age of fourteen, once took down twenty-four Japanese soldiers with twenty-four bullets, and was elected a combat hero. Due to being wounded five times and becoming disabled, he left the army in the spring of 1946 and returned to the Taihang Mountains. For fifteen years, he has been standing on the forefront of the construction struggle, leading the militia and masses of Nan Cheng Village, daring to think and daring to act, and engaging in vigorous technical innovation, making Nan Cheng Village the first in the Taihang Mountains to achieve semi-mechanization.

This was the earth-shaking year of 1958. The People's Commune was established, and in order to develop production, many machines were purchased. The people in the mountain village had never used these things before, and Li Bingbi had never stepped into a schoolroom, so he knew nothing about machines either. However, the Party and the masses trusted him, and they all said that he was the most daring and capable person. Li Bingbi was greatly encouraged and immediately selected six militiamen to form a technical research group. He took out 160 yuan of disability pension from the bank and bought a set of simple repair tools. With just these, they started from scratch, carried forward the hard-struggle style of the "Old Eighth Route Army," and vigorously engaged in machine repair and tool innovation.

Everything is hard at the beginning. In May, it was the time of drought and water use, but a diesel pump broke down. How anxious! The pump operator breathlessly found militia battalion commander Li Bingbi. Li Bingbi led his research group to take a look, but they didn't even know where the problem was. They had to send it to a factory in Changzhi City for repair overnight, but the factory said they didn't have time within two months, as the production tasks of the Great Leap Forward were too tight.

"Pull it back and do it ourselves!" Once Li Bingbi made up his mind, he would brave even a mountain of knives. He remembered that when he was a scout in the Eighth Route Army, didn't he start by not even being able to disassemble a pistol! So, he and six militiamen brought a good diesel pump too, and started working on it at his home. They adopted the primitive method of comparing good and bad, "ants gnawing at bones!" They removed a part from the broken machine and installed it on the good machine for testing. If the good machine still worked, it proved that the part was not broken. They disassembled one, installed one, tested one... but they couldn't find the problem. Some people were discouraged and said, "This is foreign stuff, we roughnecks can't do it." Li Bingbi did not lose heart. He encouraged everyone, "Foreign stuff is still controlled by people. We used the enemy's foreign guns and cannons the same way on the battlefield after we captured them!" The militiamen became even more energetic, lighting gas lamps to work through the night, and finally found that the electric coil on a high-pressure oil pump was broken, and immediately repaired it. In this way, they broke through the technical barrier!

In winter, the leadership decided to send Li Bingbi to a provincial water conservancy machinery training class to study. But he didn't pass the entrance exam, handing in a blank paper on five math problems. When he reported back to the leadership, he shed tears: "I have failed the Party's hopes." The leadership encouraged him to persist in self-study and give full play to his spirit of diligence and daring to think and act. Li Bingbi immediately bought a large package of books from the Xinhua Bookstore, including "Everything for the Party," "How the Steel Was Tempered," as well as "Learn Science," "Improve Water Lifting Tools," "Steam Engine Principles," "Internal Combustion Engine Structure," "Electrical Research," and so on. From then on, his home became a small library, with more than four hundred books and five kinds of newspapers and magazines. If he didn't have time during the day, he would study before going to bed at night.

Diligence and hard study produce genius, and Li Bingbi finally became a pioneer in technical innovation. He could transform a dilapidated cotton gin into a wheat thresher; based on the principle of the peanut sheller, he created a corn shelling machine that increased work efficiency by 180 times. He once traveled thousands of miles to "study abroad," going to another place to draw back a waterwheel blueprint. Together with the militia technical research group, he transformed five kinds of waterwheels: hand-cranked, three-wheeled, five-wheeled, gear-wheeled, and foot-pedaled. He also connected two five-horsepower generators together, giving every mountain village in the entire management area night-bright pearls—electric lights. Especially after the large-scale operation of the dining halls, the entire management area implemented dining hall-ization. Grinding rice and milling flour every day occupied twelve livestock and twenty-four people, but it was still not enough for the dining hall's consumption. In order to solve this big problem, Li Bingbi led the militia technical research group to take the lead. After repeated research, based on the watermill principle, they put a stone mill on the waterwheel frame, and then used a five-horsepower locomobile to drive it, creating the first machine mill in the Taihang Mountains, which could grind more than three thousand catties of corn flour every day. At this time, the sieve for sifting flour could not keep up with the need. Six female militiamen were exhausted and sweating every day, and they couldn't sieve all the flour. They complained, "I would rather work in the fields for a day than sieve corn flour at home." Li Bingbi and the militiamen started their brains again, and began to design using the principle of a windmill. They drew a picture but couldn't create a model. They also used cardboard and tinplate to cut various machine part styles to replace the model. One failure, and then another, they were stuck for two full days and nights without sleep, but still did not succeed. But they would never admit defeat, never lose the battle! They persisted in fighting for another day and night, finally conquering the "bastion" of the fan, cleverly making a flour-sifting machine. One machine could sieve the flour of two mills, and two mills only needed two people to operate, producing seven thousand catties of flour a day, increasing work efficiency by thirty-five times. The province held an on-site meeting here.

In the past two years, Li Bingbi and his militia technical research group have been holding high the red flag of technical innovation and technical revolution, creating, imitating, and modifying 137 kinds of tools, more than 25,000 pieces, making the entire management area achieve semi-mechanization. People call him a "red local expert" and a "pioneer of innovation."

    民兵营长李秉壁巧攻技术关
    新华社记者　姜庆肇　莎荫　东书
    在全国民兵代表会议上，有一位民兵营长又是公社业余红专学校校长的“老八路”，他名叫李秉壁，胸前挂满了二十多枚金光闪闪的奖章。他来自太行山上的南呈村。
    李秉壁，十四岁就干过八路军，曾经用二十四发子弹打倒二十四个日本鬼子，当选过战斗英雄。由于他五次负伤，身体残废，于1946年春天，离开部队，重返太行山上。十五年来，他一直站在建设斗争的最前线，领导着南呈村民兵和群众，敢想敢干，大闹技术革新，使南呈村在太行山区第一个实现了半机械化。
    这是翻天复地的1958年。人民公社成立了，为了发展生产，买了不少机器。山村的人们没有摆弄过这些玩意，李秉壁从小没有进过书房门，对机器也是一窍不通，但是党和群众信任他，都说他是个最敢想敢干的人。李秉壁受到极大鼓舞，马上抽调六个民兵，成立了一个技术研究小组。他从银行里取出一百六十元残废金，购买了一套简单的修械工具。就凭着这些，他们白手起家，发扬着“老八路”的艰苦奋斗的作风，大闹起机械修理和工具革新。
    万事起头难。5月里，正是天旱用水的时候，却有一台柴油抽水机坏了。真急熬人！抽水机手气喘嘘嘘地找到民兵营长李秉壁，李秉壁带领着他的研究小组跑去一看，连究竟坏在什么地方也不知道，只得连夜送到长治市工厂去修，可是工厂说两个月内没工夫，现在大跃进的生产任务太紧。
    “把它拉回来，自己干！”李秉壁决心一下，就是刀山也要闯，他想起当年在八路军当侦察兵时，开始不也是连个匣子枪都拆不开！于是，他和六个民兵把一台好的柴油抽水机也抬来了，就在他家里干起来了。他们采取好坏对比的土方法，“蚂蚁啃骨头！”从坏机器上卸下一个零件安装到好机器上去试验，如果好机器仍然转动，那就证明这个零件没有坏。他们拆一个，安一个，试一个……，始终没有检查出毛病来。有的人泄了气说：“这是洋玩意，咱们大老粗干不了。”李秉壁不灰心，他鼓励大家说：“洋玩意还不是听人使唤的，我们在战场上缴获了鬼子的洋枪洋炮一样用！”民兵们的劲头更足了，连夜点起汽灯照着干，终于检验出是一个高压油泵上的电圈坏了，并且马上把它修理好。就这样，他们闯进了技术关！
    冬天，领导上决定送李秉壁到省的水利机械训练班去学习。可是他没有考取，在五道数学题上交了白卷。回来向领导上汇报时，他落泪了：“我辜负了党的希望。”领导上勉励他坚持自学，发挥勤奋好学和敢想敢干的精神。李秉壁马上就在新华书店买了一大包书，有“把一切献给党”、“钢铁是怎样炼成的”，也有“学科学”、“改良提水工具”、蒸汽机原理、内燃机构造、电气研究等。从此，他家里就成了一个小图书馆，有四百多本书，五种报刊杂志，白天没工夫，就在晚上睡觉以前学。
    勤奋好学出天才，李秉壁终于成为技术革新的闯将。他能把一架破烂的棉花机改造成打麦机；根据花生脱壳机的原理，创造出提高工效一百八十倍的玉米脱粒机。他曾经千里“留学”，跑到外地去画回一个水车图样，同民兵技术研究小组一起，改造了手摇、三轮、五轮、牙轮、脚踏等五种水车，并且把两个五马力的发电机连到一起，给全管理区各个山村都挂上了夜明珠——电灯。特别是大办食堂以后，全管理区实行了食堂化，每天推米碾面，就占用了十二个牲口，二十四个人，还赶不上食堂吃用。为了解决这个大问题，李秉壁率领着民兵技术研究组一马当先，经过反复钻研，根据水磨原理，把石磨放到水车架上，然后用五马力锅驼机带动，创造了太行山上第一盘机器磨，每天可磨玉米面三千多斤。这时，筛面的箩又赶不上需要，每天六个女民兵累得满头大汗，都筛不完面，她们抱怨说：“宁愿上地干一天，不愿在家箩玉面。”李秉壁和民兵们又开动了脑筋，开始用风车原理进行设计，画了图却创造不出模型。他们又用硬纸片和洋铁片剪成各种机器零件的式样，代替模型，一次失败，再来一次，整整憋了两天两夜没睡觉，还是没有成功。可是决不服输，不败阵！他们又坚持战斗了一昼夜，终于攻下了风扇“堡垒”，巧制箩面机，一个可筛两盘磨的面，两盘磨只用两个人操作，一天出面七千斤，提高工效三十五倍。省里在这里召开了现场会。
    两年来，李秉壁和他的民兵技术研究小组，就是这样高举着技术革新和技术革命的红旗，创制、仿制和改制各种工具一百三十七种，二万五千多件，使全管理区实现了半机械化。人们称他为“红色土专家”、“革新的闯将”。
