    The Revolution in Thought and Culture in Hungary
    Hungary Wilt Adam

    On April 4, the Hungarian people will celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of their liberation. Since the Hungarian people were liberated from the oppression of German fascists and their Hungarian lackeys, the realization of the socialist revolution has brought about fundamental changes in the lives of the Hungarian people. The new people's regime has replaced the past reactionary rule of Horthy. The living conditions of the working people have improved, and socialist construction has provided the Hungarian working people with a practical basis for realizing their decades-long ideals. However, we cannot fully understand the fundamental changes in the lives of our people if we do not mention the ideological and cultural revolution that began after our liberation and must continue in the future.

    Before 1945, Hungary was a culturally backward country. Although Hungary had outstanding scientists and great artists in the past, such as János Bolyai, Loránd Eötvös, Sándor Petőfi, Attila József, Ferenc Liszt, and Béla Bartók, the vast majority of working people had no opportunity to learn culture and science. In the 1930s, only one in ninety people received higher education, one in forty had a high school education, and one in fourteen had a cultural level equivalent to the current eight-year compulsory education system. The vast majority of residents—79.5%—did not even finish primary school, and 9.6% were illiterate. After liberation, in the new people's democratic Hungary, opportunities arose to eliminate this backwardness. In 1958, one in fifty-three residents over the age of six had graduated from university, one in twenty had graduated from secondary school, one in five had a cultural level equivalent to compulsory education, and illiteracy had been eliminated.

    Our people have made great achievements in improving their cultural level. However, this does not most profoundly explain the essential issues of our cultural and ideological revolution. Our goal in the struggle is to achieve the complete victory of the working class's thought—Marxism-Leninism—in thought and culture. The most important source of our achievements is that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is a Marxist-Leninist party, and every achievement of our party is a victory for Marxist-Leninist thought.

    At the same time, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party also knows that the socialist ideological and cultural revolution has not yet been completed. Comrade Kádár has said that after we seized power, eliminating the economic rights of the bourgeoisie was a relatively simple task. But confiscating the bourgeoisie's means of production does not mean that we have achieved complete victory. A longer and more complex task is to liberate the vast majority of the working people from the influence of bourgeois political ideology and unite them around us, standing on the Marxist-Leninist position. Only after completing this task can our victory be called a complete victory.

    Therefore, at the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party held last December, the issues of ideological work and cultural revolution were discussed in depth. The central issue of the Party's Seventh Congress was to accelerate socialist construction and complete the foundation of socialism as soon as possible. The realization of this task urgently requires better ideological work and the thorough realization of the cultural revolution. The Party Congress also drew lessons from the past in this regard. On the one hand: a socialist cultural revolution cannot be launched and thoroughly realized without resolutely opposing revisionist views. The Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion of 1956 clearly and prominently exposed the essence of revisionism. The fact of the counter-revolutionary rebellion proved that revisionist views seized the weapons of the Party and the proletariat in the struggle against bourgeois political ideology. Therefore, although our Party has dealt a devastating blow to revisionism since 1956 and eliminated the ideological influence of revisionism among the basic masses of Party members, the Party has always regarded revisionism as the main danger that should be resolutely opposed. On the other hand, the Party has also learned lessons from dogmatism and sectarianism. Pseudo-"leftist" sectarianism and dogmatism neglected open ideological struggle, ignored the significance of persuasive education work among the masses, distorted the unique tools and forms of class struggle on the ideological front, and disrupted the normal relationship between the Party and the masses. The Seventh Congress of the Party determined the task of striving for the complete victory of the socialist revolution in this way: under the two-front struggle policy carried out in the ideological and cultural revolution, errors of right-wing revisionism and "left-wing" dogmatism should be avoided.

    In the years after crushing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the widespread Marxist-Leninist ideological work and the Party's correct cultural and educational policies have now yielded fruitful results. This can be seen in all aspects of ideological and cultural life. Let's look at the areas most deeply poisoned by the counter-revolution of 1956 and the influence of nationalism and revisionist thought, namely, art and literature. As everyone knows, at that time, the literary and art circles were a major stronghold of the counter-revolution. Initially, the revisionists only started actions on small-scale cultural issues, provoking literary disputes, slandering socialist realism, and attacking the Leninist principle of the Party spirit of literature and art. The enemy shouted loudly that writers—including all intellectuals—opposed socialism, the People's Republic, and the Party; if writers once maintained silence—went on strike—then the entire Hungarian cultural life would stagnate.

    Despite the various vicious predictions made by the enemy, the fact is that in the years after the counter-revolutionary rebellion was crushed, our literary and artistic life has re-opened its flowers. Contrary to what the so-called "silent" writers said, more literary works have been published in these years than before 1956. In 1958, poems, prose, and plays written by one hundred and fifty-one writers were published. In 1959, one hundred and ninety writers published their works. If we include writers who write specifically for young people and children, the total reaches three hundred writers. What is most gratifying is that both the Party spirit and artistry of these works have been strengthened. Party spirit and socialist realism, which were the targets of vicious attacks by the counter-revolution, have now re-emerged as the basis for creation among our writers and artists. In recent years, some works have appeared that depict our real life and the struggle against the counter-revolution, such as András Berkes' "October Storm" and "After the Storm," Géza Molnár's "Raging Sea" and "Márto," József Darvas' "Gloomy Sky," Imre Dobozy's "Storm," Lajos Mesterházi's "Budapesters," and film scripts such as "Yesterday" and "Early Morning Glow." In the writing of poetry, the Party spirit and communist tone have become increasingly stronger. What shows the consolidation of literary and artistic life and the rise of socialist thought is that in 1959, the Writers' Association and other art associations were reorganized and resumed their activities on a socialist basis. How did our literature and art develop so rapidly in such a short period of time? Where does the power for the new life of socialist literature and art come from after the counter-revolutionary rebellion?

    One of the most important sources of new life is the Party's unwavering ideological work and cultural and educational policies. A series of significant documents contributed to the ideological clarification in literary and art circles, such as the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party's "Cultural Program," the Cultural Theory Working Group's documents on "Populist" writers, and "Several Issues on Hungarian Literature After Liberation." Ideological struggle and critical work are very necessary, both now and in the future, because there are various bourgeois elements in our cultural life, and the influence of apoliticality and formalism is still quite large. The newly re-established literary and art associations can become a strong base for this ideological work. The debate on Hungarian drama organized by the drama department of the Writers' Association, and the debate on Hungarian lyric poetry, aesthetics, and ethics today organized by the poetry department of the Writers' Association, have all launched great ideological struggles. These debates were full of militant Marxist-Leninist thought.

    Another most important factor that enabled our literature and art to be reborn is real life, the attitude of workers and peasants, and the profound influence of the achievements of socialist construction on intellectuals, writers, and artists. Under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party, the great achievements made in socialist construction, and the fact that workers and peasants trust the Party and closely follow the workers' and peasants' revolutionary government, have had a great influence on them. The Hungarian working class has proven that they can stand firmly on the Party's position, closely follow the Party, and fight to the end to accelerate socialist construction.

    The labor enthusiasm and heroic behavior of the working class have aroused writers and intellectuals to engage in selfless labor. Some writers have established close ties with factories, and they draw writing material from the lives of workers. At present, the Writers' Association regards strengthening the ties between the working class and writers as its most important task. The revolutionary changes in the Hungarian countryside have also had a great influence on Hungarian writers. Describing the lives of the peasant masses has always occupied a very important position in Hungarian literature, both in the past and now. In recent years, Hungarian peasants have taken a big step forward, with most peasants embarking on the socialist road and joining agricultural cooperatives. This action by the peasants has attracted the attention of writers. Not only Party member writers, but even general writers are willing to create with the theme of peasants.

    Although literature and art are only a part of the socialist revolution in thought and culture, they can reflect the development of the entire socialist cultural revolution. The development of our scientific life, education, and other cultural aspects is also a socialist development. Because the foundation of the entire socialist cultural revolution is the socialist transformation of the ideological consciousness of the working masses, workers, and peasants, and the ideological feelings of the Hungarian working people have undergone revolutionary changes. The working class has not only made great achievements on the production front, but also their socialist consciousness has been raised. In factories, various "socialist labor teams" not only compete to increase production, but also compete in the study of socialist culture and socialist morality. Peasants in the countryside who have embarked on the socialist agricultural road are breaking away from bourgeois individualism and accepting the noble principles of collective labor and socialist collective life. This change in the ideological consciousness of the working masses ensures that the socialist revolution will inevitably achieve a complete victory in our country in thought and culture.

    匈牙利在思想和文化方面的革命
    匈牙利　威尔特·阿达姆
    4月4日匈牙利人民将庆祝自己解放的十五周年。自从匈牙利人民由德国法西斯及其在匈牙利的走狗压迫下解放以后，随着实现了社会主义革命，这使匈牙利人民的生活发生了根本的变化。新的人民政权代替了过去的霍尔蒂反动统治。劳动人民的生活状况有了好转，社会主义建设使匈牙利劳动人民有了实现几十年来的理想的实际基础。但是如果我们不提及我国解放后所已开始而今后仍须继续进行的思想和文化革命，就不能了解我国人民生活中的根本变化的全貌。
    1945年以前，匈牙利是一个文化落后的国家。过去匈牙利虽然也有出色的科学家和伟大的艺术家，如包亚依·亚诺什、奥特维什·洛朗德、裴多菲·山道尔、尤若夫·阿蒂拉、里斯特·费伦茨和巴尔托克·贝拉等，但是绝大多数劳动人民根本没有学习文化和科学的机会。在三十年代，每九十人中才有一人受到高等教育，每四十人中才有一人读过高中，每十四人中才有一人具有相当于现在的八年普及制学校的文化程度。绝大部分居民——79.5％的人连小学都不能读完，9.6％的居民是文盲。解放以后，在新的人民民主的匈牙利，出现了消除这种落后状态的机会。1958年，六岁以上的居民中每五十三人就有一人在大学毕业，每二十人就有一人在中学毕业，每五个人就有一人具有相当于普及学校的文化程度，而且已经消灭了文盲。
    我国人民在提高文化水平方面取得了伟大的成就。然而这并不能最深刻地说明我国文化和思想革命的本质问题。我们的斗争目标是在思想和文化方面也要使工人阶级的思想——马克思列宁主义获得完全的胜利。我们现在所取得的成就的最主要的源泉，因为匈牙利社会主义工人党是马克思列宁主义的党，我们党的每一项成就都是马克思列宁主义思想的胜利。
    同时，匈牙利社会主义工人党也知道，社会主义思想和文化革命尚未完成。卡达尔同志说过，在我们掌握了政权以后，消灭资产阶级的经济权利是一项比较简单的任务。但是没收了资产阶级的生产资料，并不意味着我们已取得了彻底胜利。比这更长期更复杂的任务是把绝大部分劳动人民从资产阶级的政治思想影响下解放出来，并使他们团结在我们周围，站在马克思列宁主义的立场上。完成了这项任务之后，我们的胜利才能称为彻底的胜利。
    因此，在匈牙利社会主义工人党去年12月举行的第七次代表大会上，深入地讨论了思想工作和文化革命的问题。党的第七次代表大会工作的中心问题，是加速社会主义建设和尽快完成奠定社会主义基础。这个任务的实现迫切要求更好地进行思想工作和彻底实现文化革命。党的代表大会在这方面也汲取了过去的教训。一方面是：不坚决反对修正主义观点，就不能掀起和彻底实现社会主义的文化革命。1956年匈牙利反革命叛乱明显而突出地暴露了修正主义的本质。反革命叛乱的事实证明，修正主义的观点夺取了党和无产阶级在反对资产阶级的政治思想斗争中的武器。因此，虽然我们党在1956年以来给了修正主义以毁灭性的打击，在党员基本群众中消除修正主义的思想影响，但是党始终把修正主义看作是应该坚决反对的主要危险。另一方面，党从教条主义和宗派主义方面也得到了教训。伪装“左”倾的宗派主义和教条主义忽视了公开的思想斗争，忽视了在群众中进行说服教育工作的意义，歪曲了思想战线上阶级斗争的特有工具和形式，扰乱了党和群众之间的正常关系。党的第七次代表大会是这样确定了争取社会主义革命完全胜利的任务：在思想和文化革命方面所进行的两条战线的斗争方针下，应该避免犯右倾修正主义的错误和“左”倾教条主义的错误。
    在粉碎反革命叛乱以后的几年中，广泛进行的马克思列宁主义思想工作，党的正确的文化教育政策，现在已经结下了丰硕的果实。这可以在思想和文化生活的各个方面看出来。我们看一看1956年反革命的毒害和民族主义、修正主义思想影响最深的那些方面，即是艺术和文学方面。大家知道，在当时，文艺界是反革命的一个主要阵地。起初修正主义者仅仅是在小规模的文化问题上开始行动，挑起文学争论并诬蔑社会主义现实主义，攻击文艺的党性的列宁原则。敌人大喊大叫地说，作家——包括所有知识分子——都反对社会主义，反对人民共和国，反对党；如果作家一旦保持沉默——罢工，那么整个匈牙利的文化生活就会停顿。
    尽管敌人作出种种恶毒的预言，但事实是：在反革命叛乱被粉碎后的几年来，我们的文艺生活已重新开放了花朵，同所谓“保持沉默”的作家所说的相反，这几年内出版的文学作品比1956年以前多得多。1958年共出版了一百五十一位作家写的诗、散文和剧本。1959年则有一百九十名作家发表了作品，如果把专为青年和儿童写作的作家算在一起，则共达三百名作家。最使人感到高兴的是，这些作品中党性和艺术性都加强了。党性和社会主义现实主义曾是反革命恶毒攻击的对象，如今在我们作家和艺术家中重新成为创作的基础。近年来出现了一些描写我们的现实生活和同反革命斗争的作品，如贝尔柯什·昂德拉什所写的“十月暴风雨”和“暴风雨之后”，莫尔纳尔·盖孜所写的“怒海狂涛”和“玛尔托”等小说，道尔瓦什·尤若夫所写的“阴暗的天”，杜包孜·伊姆雷所写的“风暴”，麦什特尔哈则·拉约什所写的“布达佩斯人”等剧，以及“昨天”和“早霞”等电影剧本。在诗的写作方面，党性的共产主义音调越来越强了。表明文艺生活的巩固和社会主义思想上升的，是1959年在社会主义基础上作家协会和其他艺术协会重新组织起来并恢复了活动。我国文学和艺术在这样短的时间内怎样发展得这样迅速呢？反革命叛乱后，社会主义文艺得以新生的力量来自何处呢？
    新生的最主要源泉之一就是党的始终不渝的思想工作和文教政策。在文艺界促成思想澄清的有一系列意义重大的文件，如匈牙利社会主义工人党的“文化纲领”，文化理论工作组关于“民粹派”作家，以及“关于解放后匈牙利文学的几个问题”等文件。思想斗争和批判工作，无论现在或将来都很需要，因为在我们的文化生活里有各种资产阶级的因素存在，非政治性和形式主义的影响还相当大。重新成立的各种文艺协会能够成为这个思想工作的强有力的根据地。作家协会的戏剧部组织的关于匈牙利戏剧的辩论会，作家协会诗歌部组织的关于今天匈牙利的抒情诗、美学和伦理学的辩论会，都曾开展了极大的思想上的斗争。这些辩论都充满了战斗性的马克思列宁主义思想。
    使我国文学和艺术得以新生的另一个最重要的因素就是现实生活、工人和农民群众的态度，以及社会主义建设成就对知识分子、作家和艺术家的深刻影响。在社会主义工人党领导下，在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成就，以及工农群众信任党，紧跟着工农革命政府这一事实，给他们的影响很大。匈牙利的工人阶级证明了，他们能够坚定地站在党的立场上，紧紧地跟着党，为加速社会主义的建设而奋斗到底。
    工人阶级的劳动热情和英雄行为唤起了作家和知识界进行忘我的劳动。一部分作家同工厂建立了密切联系，他们从工人生活中汲取写作的题材。目前作家协会把加强工人阶级同作家的联系当作自己最主要的任务。匈牙利农村的革命性的变化对匈牙利作家也有很大影响。在匈牙利文学中描写农民群众的生活无论过去或现在都占极重要地位。近几年来匈牙利农民前进了一大步，大部分农民走上社会主义大道，加入了农业合作社。农民的这一行动引起了作家的注意。不但是党员作家，连一般作家也都愿以农民的题材进行创作。
    虽然文学和艺术只是思想和文化方面社会主义革命的一部分，但是它能够反映出整个社会主义文化革命的发展情况。我们的科学生活、教育和其他文化方面的发展，也都是具有社会主义性质的发展。因为整个社会主义文化革命的基础，是劳动群众、工人、农民思想意识上的社会主义改造，而匈牙利劳动人民的思想感情已发生了革命性的变化。工人阶级不但在生产战线上取得了伟大成就，而且他们的社会主义觉悟也提高了。在工厂里，各个“社会主义劳动队”不仅为提高产量而进行竞赛，而且在社会主义文化的学习上和社会主义道德上也进行了竞赛。农村中走上社会主义农业道路的农民，正在摆脱资产阶级个人主义思想而接受集体劳动和社会主义集体生活的高尚原则。劳动群众思想意识上的这种变化，就保证了社会主义革命在我国思想和文化方面必然取得彻底的胜利。
