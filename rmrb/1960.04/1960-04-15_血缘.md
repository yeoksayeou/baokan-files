    Blood Ties
    Chi Bei'ou poem, Hua Junwu drawing
    Recently, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Satterthwaite, once again spoke at length about the historical connections and blood relations between the United States and Africa, saying that the United States therefore has a "special concern" for African affairs.

    Three hundred years ago, we were one family,
    Your aunt's cousin is his uncle's wife,
    For American lords to claim kinship with black people,
    Is simply too sickening.

    At home, they shout for beatings and killings;
    Abroad, they say all the nice things.
    The same treatment of black people,
    Why the initial arrogance followed by obsequiousness?

    It is said that not only are there historical connections,
    But also blood relations;
    Therefore, there is no need to distinguish between us,
    "What's yours is mine."

    It's not that there is black blood in the veins,
    But that there is black blood on the hands,
    The fox has put on grandma's coat,
    Still a fox.

    血缘	池北偶诗　华君武画
    美国负责非洲事务的助理国务卿萨脱斯威特最近又大谈美国同非洲的历史联系和血统关系，说因此美国对于非洲事务“特别关心”。
    三百年前是一家，
    你的表姨是他舅妈，
    美国老爷同黑人攀亲戚，
    未免太肉麻。
    在国内喊打喊杀；
    向国外说尽好话。
    同是对待黑种人，
    何前倨而后恭也。
    据说不仅有历史联系，
    而且还有血统关系；
    因而不必分彼此，
    “你的就是我的”。
    不是脉管里有黑人的血液，
    是手上有黑人的血迹，
    狐狸披上了外婆的外套，
    依旧是狐狸。
