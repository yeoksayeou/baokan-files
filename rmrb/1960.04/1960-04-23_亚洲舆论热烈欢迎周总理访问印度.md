Asian Public Opinion Warmly Welcomes Premier Zhou's Visit to India
    Vietnam's "Capital Hanoi Newspaper" says: Differences between China and India can definitely be resolved in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation.
    "New Rangoon Daily" says: Sino-Indian friendship is of great significance to world peace and the solidarity of Asian and African countries.
    Cambodia's "Unity Newspaper" says: The imperialist plot to undermine Sino-Indian relations will surely fail.
    Iraq's "National Newspaper" says: Sino-Burmese and Sino-Nepalese talks prove People's China's friendly attitude towards its neighbors.
    Israel's "People's Voice" says: Premier Zhou's visit to India is the best proof of China's friendly attitude.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 21st - The "Capital Hanoi Newspaper" here published a commentary today saying that the Vietnamese people, like the Asian people, sincerely hope that the border issue between China and India can be resolved well.
    The commentary said, "The Sino-Indian border issue is a complex problem left over by history. The border between China and India has never been officially demarcated. The 'McMahon Line,' unilaterally drawn up by British colonialists in the past, cannot be used as a legitimate basis. Not only the government of the People's Republic of China, but also the various central governments of China in the past, did not recognize this so-called 'border'."
    The commentary said that imperialists and certain ill-intentioned people, based on some ulterior motives, had frantically used the dispute over the Sino-Indian border issue to alienate the long-standing friendly relations between the two countries, attempting to isolate China among Asian countries. "However, all these anti-China activities have brought them results contrary to their wishes. The more they are hostile to China, the more isolated they become. The broad masses of people in India and other Asian countries hope to maintain friendly relations with the Chinese people."
    The commentary pointed out that China and India have a strong foundation for long-term friendly cooperation. It said that, as Premier Zhou Enlai has repeatedly pointed out, the differences of opinion between the two countries can definitely be properly resolved through friendly consultations and in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation.
    The commentary emphasized that "the successful signing of the agreements on the Sino-Burmese and Sino-Nepalese border issues further illustrates the practical possibility of resolving the Sino-Indian border issue."
    Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 22nd - Rangoon newspapers continue to publish editorials and articles, warmly welcoming the talks currently being held between the Prime Ministers of China and India, and expressing the hope that the Sino-Indian border issue can be resolved as soon as possible on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
    The "New Rangoon Daily" said in an editorial, "Sino-Indian friendly cooperation is of great significance to world peace and the solidarity between Asian and African countries. This solidarity will prevent the clutches of colonialist exploiters from extending to the sacred land of Asia and Africa."
    The newspaper said, "Premier Zhou Enlai went to India with sincerity and confidence in the Sino-Indian border issue talks."
    The newspaper pointed out, "Only warmongers in the world hope to see Sino-Indian relations deteriorate in order to fish in troubled waters and achieve their shameful purposes."
    The "New Rangoon Daily" also said in a commentary, "Premier Zhou Enlai hopes to successfully conclude an agreement on the Sino-Indian border issue on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and we also hold the same hope."
    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 22nd - Cambodian newspapers have successively published commentaries, emphasizing the great significance of Premier Zhou Enlai's current foreign visits to strengthening the unity of the peoples of Asian countries, and hoping for the success of the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India.
    Cambodia's "Observer Newspaper" published a commentary today entitled "The Bandung Spirit is Constantly Strengthening" on the Sino-Indian talks. The commentary emphasized the importance of peacefully resolving the Sino-Indian border issue, saying that in the face of the war forces' conspiracy to undermine the good neighborly relations between China and India, it is necessary to maintain the friendship between the two countries.
    Commenting on the Sino-Burmese border issue, the commentary said that in Burma, a similar problem that arose under similar circumstances has been resolved. The signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the Border Agreement shows that any problem can be resolved peacefully as long as the parties concerned show sincerity and the same willingness to obtain a fair and reasonable solution. The commentary said that the welcome Premier Zhou Enlai received in Burma and the Sino-Burmese Joint Communiqué once again show that the Asian people are following a policy of peaceful coexistence.
    The "Friendship Newspaper" wrote on the 21st that since the Bandung Conference was held five years ago, the peoples of Asia and Africa have been carrying out a common struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The newspaper said that the unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa has been developing. However, imperialists are trying every possible means to undermine this unity, such as provoking Sino-Indian relations on the border issue. However, in the struggle to eliminate these obstacles, this unity is becoming more and more consolidated.
    The commentary said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and other Asian countries further demonstrates the confidence of the peoples of Asia and Africa in this friendship.
    The "Unity Newspaper" published a commentary on the 21st condemning the imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the Bandung spirit on the Sino-Indian border issue. The commentary pointed out that the talks currently being held between the Prime Ministers of China and India are a way to resolve the disputes between the two countries. Although the Sino-Indian border dispute has not yet been resolved, the imperialists' conspiracy to undermine Sino-Indian relations has failed and will continue to fail.
    The commentary said that China and Burma have resolved their border issues. The newspaper expressed the hope that the Sino-Indian border issue will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the Bandung spirit, just like the Sino-Burmese border issue.
    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 21st - Iraq's "National Newspaper" published an editorial today, expressing the earnest hope that the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India will lead to an agreement, thereby restoring and further enhancing the friendship between the two countries.
    The editorial said that friends of the two major Asian countries - People's China and India - hope that this meeting will lead to an agreement, thereby eliminating all differences on the border issue that are being used by the enemies of Sino-Indian friendship.
    The newspaper said that the Sino-Indian border dispute was left over by the imperialists who once rode on the heads of the two countries.
    The newspaper said that China has many places that it cannot take care of developing, and it is inconceivable that China would covet any part of Indian territory. The newspaper said that the political system adopted by People's China is opposed to and hostile to all forms of exploitation, colonial rule, and aggression.
    The newspaper emphasized that the recent talks between China and Burma and Nepal respectively prove that "People's China not only does not harbor any hostility towards its neighbors, but quite the contrary; it provides unconditional financial and economic assistance to its neighbor Nepal. It reached an agreement with Burma, thereby ending the long-standing differences on the border issue that People's China has been demanding to resolve for many years."
    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd - Jerusalem, Israeli District News: Israel's "People's Voice" published an article on the 21st saying that the interest of Asia and the world is focused on the talks currently being held between the Prime Ministers of China and India. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to New Delhi is the best proof that China hopes to resolve the differences of opinion between the two countries through negotiations and agreements in a friendly manner.
    The article pointed out that it is no secret that the border issue has not been resolved during the period when China and India have maintained friendly relations. Both sides agreed to leave this issue for discussion, but it is clear that someone has used this issue to create conflict between the two countries. The article said that some people in the West are trying to prove that the desire to peacefully resolve the border issue is an act of aggression. However, the successful conclusion of agreements between China and Burma and Nepal has shattered this lie.

    亚洲舆论热烈欢迎周总理访问印度
    越南“首都河内报”说：中印两国分歧一定能本着互谅互让的精神解决
    “新仰光报”说：中印两国友好对世界和平和亚非国家团结有重大意义
    柬埔寨“统一报”说：帝国主义企图破坏中印两国关系的阴谋必将失败
    伊拉克“国家报”说：中缅、中尼会谈证明人民中国对邻国的友好态度
    以色列“人民呼声报”说：周总理访问印度是中国友好态度的最好证明
    新华社河内21日电　此间“首都河内报”今天发表评论说，越南人民同亚洲人民都真诚地希望中印两国之间的边界问题能获得良好解决。
    评论说，“中印边界问题是历史遗留下来的复杂问题。中印两国之间的国界一直都未曾正式划定过。英国殖民者过去擅自制定的‘麦克马洪线’不能作为合法的依据。不但是中华人民共和国政府，就是中国过去各个中央政府也都不承认这条所谓‘界线’。”
    评论说，帝国主义和某些不怀好意的人，基于某种不可告人的动机，曾经猖狂地利用中印边界问题的争端，来离间两国间悠久的友好关系，企图在亚洲国家中孤立中国。“但是，这一切反华活动却给他们带来了事与愿违的结果，他们越是与中国为敌，他们自己就越被孤立，印度和亚洲各国广大人民都希望维护同中国人民的友好关系。”
    评论指出，中印两国具有长久的友好合作的强固基础。它说，正如周恩来总理曾经多次指出，两国之间的意见分歧一定能够通过友好协商、本着互谅互让的精神加以妥善解决。
    评论强调指出，“关于中缅和中尼边界问题协定的胜利签订，进一步说明了解决中印边界问题的实际可能性。”
    新华社仰光22日电　仰光报纸继续发表社论和文章，热烈欢迎中印两国总理目前正在进行的会谈，并且表示希望，中印边界问题能够在和平共处五项原则的基础上尽早得到解决。
    “新仰光报”在社论中说，“中印友好合作对于世界和平和亚非国家之间的团结是有重大意义的。这种团结将制止殖民主义剥削者的魔爪伸向亚非两洲的神圣土地。”
    这家报纸说，“周恩来总理是怀着对于中印边界问题会谈的诚意和信心到印度去的。”
    这家报纸指出，“世界上只有战争贩子希望看到中印关系恶化，以图混水摸鱼，并且达到他们的可耻目的。”
    “新仰光报”还在一篇评论中说，“周恩来总理希望，在和平共处五项原则的基础上成功地缔结关于中印边界问题的协议，我们在这一点上也抱着同样的希望”。
    新华社金边22日电　柬埔寨报纸纷纷发表评论，强调周恩来总理目前的出国访问对加强亚洲各国人民的团结的重大意义，并且希望中印两国总理会谈成功。
    柬埔寨“观察家报”今天以“万隆精神不断增强”为题就中印会谈发表评论。评论强调和平解决中印边界问题的重要性，它说，面对着战争势力破坏中印两国睦邻关系的阴谋活动，必须保持两国之间的友谊。
    评论在谈到中缅边界问题时说，在缅甸，在类似的情况下出现的类似的问题已经解决。中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和边界协定的签订表明，只要有关双方表示出诚意和获致公正和合理解决办法的同样意愿，任何问题都可以和平解决。评论说，周恩来总理在缅甸时所受到的欢迎和中缅联合公报再次表明，亚洲人民遵循着和平共处的政策。
    “友谊报”21日写道，自从五年前举行万隆会议以来，亚非各国人民一直在进行反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同斗争。报纸说，亚非各国人民的团结一直在发展着。但是帝国主义者千方百计地企图破坏这种团结。例如在边界问题上挑拨中印关系。可是，在扫除这些障碍的斗争中这种团结愈来愈巩固。
    评论说，周恩来总理这次到印度和其它亚洲国家去访问进一步表明了亚非各国人民对这种友谊的信心。
    “统一报”21日发表评论谴责帝国主义者在中印边界问题上破坏万隆精神的阴谋。评论指出，中印两国总理正在举行的会谈是解决两国争端的一个途径。中印边界争端虽然还没有解决，但是帝国主义者破坏中印关系的阴谋已经失败，并且还将继续失败。
    评论说，中国和缅甸已经解决了它们之间的边界问题。这家报纸表示希望中印边界问题会像中缅边界问题一样通过和平途径和根据万隆精神得到解决。
    新华社巴格达21日电　伊拉克“国家报”今天发表社论，表示殷切希望中印两国总理的会谈将导致协议，从而恢复和进一步增进两国之间的友谊。
    社论说，亚洲的两个大国——人民中国和印度——的朋友们都希望这次会谈将导致协议，从而消除正在被中印友谊的敌人所利用的关于边界问题的一切分歧。
    报纸说，中印边界争端是曾经骑在两个国家头上的帝国主义者遗留下来的。
    报纸说，中国有许多地方还顾不上开发，不能设想中国会垂涎印度领土的任何部分。报纸说，人民中国所采取的政治制度是反对和敌视一切形式的剥削、殖民统治和侵略的。
    报纸强调说，最近中国同缅甸和尼泊尔分别举行的会谈证明，“人民中国不仅对它的邻国不怀任何敌意，而是完全相反；它对它的邻国尼泊尔提供了无条件的财政和经济援助。它同缅甸达成了协议，从而结束了人民中国多年来要求解决的、长期存在的关于边界问题的分歧”。
    新华社22日讯　耶路撒冷以色列区消息：以色列“人民呼声报”21日发表文章说，亚洲和全世界的兴趣正集中在中印两国总理正在举行的会谈上。周恩来总理访问新德里，是中国希望以友好的态度通过谈判和协议来解决两国之间的意见分歧的最好的证明。
    文章指出，中印两国在保持着友好关系的期间，边界问题尚未解决，这不是什么秘密。双方同意把这个问题留待讨论，但是，显然有人利用了这个问题在两国之间制造冲突。文章说，西方的某些人士企图证明希望和平解决边界问题的愿望是一种侵略行动。但是，中国同缅甸和尼泊尔之间成功地缔结协定一事粉碎了这种谎言。
