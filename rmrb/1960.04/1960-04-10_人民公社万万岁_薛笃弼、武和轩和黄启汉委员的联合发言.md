Soaring ambition to conquer dragons and subdue tigers, not afraid of floods, not afraid of drought, daring to compete with heaven. The People's Commune is a ladder to a better life, a paradise. Chairman, esteemed committee members:

We have listened to the reports from Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and we are incredibly excited. These reports show that in 1959, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people adhered to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and further achieved great and brilliant achievements in all aspects. Before attending this meeting, we inspected ten People's Communes in the six counties of Shanghai, Baoshan, Jiading, Qingpu, Songjiang, and Jinshan, and gained a deeper understanding of the unparalleled superiority of the People's Communes. Our general impression is:

Comprehensive Leap Forward in Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Sideline Occupations, and Fisheries

(1) The ten People's Communes we saw, although they all experienced varying degrees of drought and flood last year, all achieved a more comprehensive and greater leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries than the Great Leap Forward of 1958. The total agricultural output value of each People's Commune increased by more than 20% compared to the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and the unit yield of crops also greatly increased. For example, the total agricultural output value of the Changzheng People's Commune in Jiading was 14,520,000 yuan in 1959, an increase of 23.4% compared to 1958. The Shanghai Maqiao People's Commune had a large area of 2,236 mu of high-yield fields, with an average rice yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. The Red Flag Production Team of the Fengwei People's Commune in Songjiang had an average rice yield of 1,117 jin per mu, a sharp increase of 80% compared to 618 jin in 1958.

The development of animal husbandry is also very significant, and some communes have achieved or exceeded the plan of one pig per mu of land. For example, the Pengpu People's Commune raised 19,200 pigs last year, averaging 1.6 pigs per mu. Other People's Communes can all achieve the plan of one pig per mu this year. As for dairy cows, rabbits, chickens, ducks, geese, fish, etc., they have all increased several times over.

Commune-Run Industries Promote Agricultural Technological Innovation

(2) Commune-run industries are booming. The ten People's Communes can basically rely on their own commune-run industries to independently manufacture and renovate agricultural tools in large quantities, repair tractors, automobiles, water pumps, produce agricultural medicines and some chemical fertilizers. Some can also manufacture complete sets of equipment for agricultural production. For example, the Changzheng People's Commune has a total of 56 factories with 1,247 workers. Among them, the agricultural machinery factory can manufacture large-scale electric incubators that can incubate 16,000 eggs at a time, catching up with the spring hatching. It can also manufacture 4-horsepower "motors," welding machines, and water pumps.

Due to the vigorous development of commune-run industries, it has directly promoted agricultural technological innovation and improved rural productivity. At the same time, it accumulates wealth and increases new sources of income for the commune. For example, the Pengpu People's Commune had a total agricultural income of 5,006,000 yuan last year, accumulating 980,000 yuan, most of which is owned by the production team; the total industrial income was 2,780,000 yuan, accumulating 660,000 yuan, most of which is owned by the commune. It can be imagined that with the continuous development of commune-run industries, it will not only accelerate the development of agricultural production, but also accelerate the development of commune ownership, paving the way for the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. The future is great and immeasurable.

Significant Improvement in the Lives of Commune Members

(3) The material and cultural lives of commune members have improved significantly. The ten People's Communes all adopt a distribution system that combines the supply system with the wage system, generally ensuring that each person has an average of 520 jin of grain per year, supplied in fixed quantities in public canteens, and they buy their own vegetables; most people eat in the canteen, but some buy food back to eat at home, and some even cook one or two more dishes themselves. We visited many canteens and commune members' homes and saw that the food they eat is quite nutritious. Last year, the Changzheng People's Commune distributed a total of 6,027,000 yuan worth of rations and wages to commune members, with each laborer (including full and half laborers) receiving an average of 341 yuan, an increase of 18% compared to 1958. At the end of the year, after deducting rations and usual wage advances, the commune distributed more than 1,700,000 yuan in cash to commune members, and every household received a big red envelope to celebrate the happiest Spring Festival. We visited Comrade Gu Yufang, a female commune member of the Xinwu People's Commune. Before liberation, she farmed 11 mu of land and her annual income was only 320 yuan. Last year, her family of ten, with three and a half laborers, received a total of 707 yuan in cash in addition to rations. She has never lived such a prosperous life as she does now. We also visited many other families and saw that they had all bought new quilts, cotton clothes, sweaters, undershirts, galoshes, and sneakers. Many people have bought gold pens, watches, alarm clocks, bicycles, and generally have savings in the bank.

Many People's Communes were originally poor communes, but this year they all have grain reserves. For example, after expanding water conservancy projects and opening up a construction river last year, the Xinwu People's Commune in Songjiang had a bumper harvest. This year, in addition to selling grain to the state and supplying rations to commune members, it has 260,000 jin of surplus grain as reserves. We personally saw the golden millet piled up like mountains in their warehouse.

The Maqiao, Pengpu, Changzheng and other People's Communes have successively established new villages with modern scale. Two-story western-style houses are scattered like stars, and they are the residences of commune members who have become their own families. The surrounding area is green and the environment is elegant. A commune member surnamed Zhang told us that his family had lived in dilapidated thatched sheds for generations, and they never dreamed of living in buildings. Now they actually live in such good buildings, just like ascending to heaven.

All of these fully demonstrate that after the people's communes, the lives of farmers have improved significantly. So everyone said:

Gold is good, silver is good, but nothing is better than the People's Commune,
A paradise on earth is built on the spot,
Where does a happy life come from?
Thank you, benefactor, Communist Party.

And said:

Thinking of the People's Commune is good,
Picking up the burden is too little,
Working until night is still too early.

Everywhere we can see men, women, old and young, beaming with joy, full of vigor. The Jinshan County Party Committee told us that they are "mobilizing the whole party and the whole people, with one heart and one mind, vowing to seize more than 1,000 jin of rice, and will not stop until the goal is achieved." It is certain that the People's Communes will produce more, accumulate more, and distribute more this year. Many People's Communes plan to realize new residential villages, mechanized cultivation, and electrified irrigation from this year to 1962. Their slogan is: Soaring ambition to conquer dragons and subdue tigers, not afraid of floods, not afraid of drought, daring to compete with heaven. The People's Commune is a ladder to a better life, a paradise.

From the above situation, it can be seen that under the three red banners of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, China's rural areas are undergoing earth-shaking changes. The leadership of the Party, the aspirations of the masses, and the strength of the communes have formed a torrent of the great era, washing away the poor and blank face of China for thousands of years. This is a great initiative of 650 million people with world historical significance. Whether we are involved in it to play a role, or watching from the sidelines as the waves sweep away, cannot but be a most serious test.

Urban People's Communes Bring Endless Happiness to the Economic Life of Urban People

In particular, urban people's communes are now going to be built on a large scale, just like in the countryside. Thousands of urban working people are greeting the arrival of this great organization with unparalleled excitement. It can be affirmed that since the People's Communes have exerted their invincible power and unparalleled superiority in the countryside, they will naturally bring endless happiness to the economic, political, and cultural life of urban people. It can also be affirmed that because the situation in cities is more complex, the development of communization will experience a tortuous struggle process. The question is whether we are advancing by leaps and bounds with thousands of working people under the three red banners of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, or are we holding the white flag of bourgeois individualism and running counter to the wheel of history? As a member of a democratic party and as a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, needless to say, the only way is to follow the Party and Chairman Mao together with the working people, and follow the great era. Therefore, we are willing to express on this solemn platform our firm support for the rapid development of People's Communes in various cities. We will definitely take practical actions to welcome the urban People's Communes. First of all, we must earnestly study and widely publicize the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, mobilize family members and relatives, mobilize the masses we are in contact with, and enthusiastically participate in the communization movement, actively participate in social production labor and social life services. We believe that under the leadership of the Party and the joyful welcome of the people, urban People's Communes will soon grow rapidly, playing a huge role in the long-term, continuous, and great leap forward of our country's socialism. Let us shout long live the People's Commune, long live, long live, long live!

    人民公社万万岁
    薛笃弼、武和轩和黄启汉委员的联合发言
    降龙伏虎斗志昂，低不怕水，高不怕旱，敢与天公比高强。人民公社是天梯，美好生活胜天堂。主席、各位委员：
    我们听了李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理和陈叔通副主席的几个报告，感到无比兴奋。从这几个报告中可以看出1959年我国人民在党和毛主席领导下坚持总路线、大跃进、人民公社，进一步在各方面取得了伟大辉煌的成就。我们这次来参加会议之前，曾经到过上海，宝山，嘉定，青浦，松江，金山六个县视察了十个人民公社，对于人民公社的无比优越性，有了进一步的体会。总的印象是：
    农林牧副渔全面跃进
    （1）所看到的十个人民公社，虽然都在去年遇到不同程度的旱灾和涝害，但却无例外地在农林副牧渔各业普遍比大跃进的1958年有更全面，更大的跃进。各人民公社的农业总产值比大跃进的1958年都是增长在20％以上，农作物的单位产量也有很大提高。例如嘉定长征人民公社1959年农业总产值一千四百五十二万元，比1958年增长23.4％。上海马桥人民公社出现二千二百三十六亩的大面积丰收片，平均亩产水稻一千斤以上。松江枫围人民公社的红旗生产队，水稻平均亩产一千一百一十七斤，比1958年的六百一十八斤猛增80％。
    畜牧业的发展也十分显著，有的公社已实现了或超过了一亩地一头猪的计划。例如彭浦人民公社去年养猪一万九千二百头，平均达到一亩地一点六头。其他各人民公社，在今年内都可以实现一亩地一头猪的规划。至于奶牛，兔子，鸡，鸭，鹅，鱼等等，都是几倍几倍地增长。
    社办工业推动了农业技术革新
    （2）社办工业蓬勃发展，十个人民公社，基本上都可以依靠自己的社办工业自力更生地大量制造和改造农具，自己修配拖拉机、汽车、抽水机，自己生产农业用的药物和部分化学肥料。有的还可以制造农业生产的成套装备。例如长征人民公社共办有五十六个工厂，工人一千二百四十七人。其中农业机械厂就自己制造每次可孵一万六千只蛋的大型电气孵化器，赶上春孵。还可以自己制造四匹马力的“马达”，电焊机和水泵等。
    由于社办工业的蓬勃发展，对于农业技术革新，提高农村生产力，起了直接的推动作用。同时为公社积累财富增加新的源泉，如彭浦人民公社去年农业总收入五百万零六千元，积累九十八万元，大部分是生产队所有制的；工业总收入二百七十八万元，积累就有六十六万元，绝大部分是公社所有制的。可以想见，随着社办工业的不断发展，既加速农业生产的发展，也加速公社所有制的发展，为集体所有制过渡到全民所有制开辟道路，前途的伟大，不可限量。
    社员生活显著提高
    （3）社员的物质、文化生活，显著提高。十个人民公社，都是采取供给制与工资制相结合的分配制度，一般保证每人平均每年有粮食五百二十斤，在公共食堂里定量供应，菜自己买；大多数人在食堂吃，也有人买回自己家里吃，有的还自己加烧一两个菜。我们访问过许多食堂和社员住家，看见他们吃的东西在营养上是相当丰富的。长征人民公社去年分配给社员的口粮和工资共值六百零二万七千元，每一劳动力（包括全劳动和半劳动）平均分到三百四十一元，比1958年增加18％。年终的时候，该社扣除口粮和平时的工资预支，发给社员现金一百七十余万元，家家户户获得大红封包，欢度最快乐的春节。我们访问新五人民公社的一位女社员顾玉芳同志，她在解放前种十一亩地，全年收入不过三百二十元，去年一家十口，三个半劳动力，除口粮以外共分得现金七百零七元，生活过得从来没有像现在这样的富裕。我们还访问过许多人家，看到他们都新置了棉被，棉衣，羊毛衫，卫生衫，套鞋，球鞋。有不少人买了金笔，手表，座钟，脚踏车，并且普遍在银行里有存款。
    不少人民公社原来是一个穷社，今年都有储备粮，例如松江的新五人民公社，去年扩大兴修水利，开辟了一条建设河之后，全社丰收，今年除了卖给国家和供应社员口粮以外，还有二十六万斤余粮作储备。我们亲自在他们的库房里，看到金黄的谷子，堆积如山。
    马桥、彭浦、长征等人民公社，都先后建立了具有现代规模的新村，一幢幢两层楼的洋房，星罗棋布，那就是社员们自成一家的住宅。周围绿化，环境幽雅。一位姓张的社员对我们说：他从前世世代代住的是烂草棚，从来作梦也想不到有楼房居住，现在居然住到这样好的楼房来，真像登上天堂一样。
    所有这些，充分表明人民公社化以后，农民生活显著提高。所以大家都说：
    金好银好，没有人民公社好，
    人间天堂就地造，
    幸福生活那里来，
    感谢恩人共产党。
    又说：
    想起人民公社好，
    挑起担子都嫌少，
    做到晚上还嫌早。
    我们到处都可以看到男女老幼，喜气洋洋，春风满面，干劲冲天。金山县党委对我们说：他们正在“全党全民齐动员，一条心，一股劲，誓夺水稻超千斤，不达目的不收兵”。肯定今年人民公社生产更多，积累更多，分配更多。不少人民公社规划从今年起到1962年全部实现住宅新村化、耕种机械化、灌溉电气化。他们的口号是：降龙伏虎斗志昂，低不怕水，高不怕旱，敢与天公比高强。人民公社是天梯，美好生活胜天堂。
    从以上情况可以看出，我国农村在党的总路线，大跃进，人民公社三面红旗之下，正经历着翻天复地的变化。党的领导，群众的志愿，公社的力量，形成大时代的洪流，要把几千年来我国一穷二白的面貌冲洗干干净净。这是六亿五千万人民的具有世界历史意义的伟大创举，我们是投入其中发挥作用，还是旁观侧看待波涛卷走，不能不是一个最严重的考验。
    城市人民公社给城市人民经济生活带来无穷无尽的美好
    特别是现在城市人民公社将要和农村一样大办起来了。千千万万的城市劳动人民正以无比兴奋的心情欢呼这个伟大的组织的来临。可以肯定，人民公社既然在农村发挥了它的无敌威力和无比的优越性，自然会同样带来给城市人民经济生活，政治和文化生活无穷无尽的美好。也可以肯定由于城市的情况比较复杂，公社化的发展，要经历一段曲折的斗争过程，问题就在于我们是跟千千万万劳动人民一道在党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗之下，大踏步前进，还是扯着资产阶级个人主义的白旗，和历史车轮背道而驰？我们作为民主党派成员之一，作为全国政协委员之一，不用说唯一的道路是和劳动人民一起跟党和毛主席走，跟大时代走。所以我们愿在这个庄严的讲台上表示坚决拥护人民公社迅速在各城市发展。我们一定以实际行动，迎接城市人民公社。首先认真学习和广泛宣传总路线、大跃进、人民公社，动员家属和亲友，动员周围联系的群众，一起热烈地投入公社化运动，积极参加社会生产劳动和社会生活服务。我们相信，城市人民公社在党的领导和人民群众欢欣鼓舞迎接下，马上就会迅速壮大起来，为我国社会主义的长期持续大跃进，发挥巨大作用。让我们高呼人民公社万岁，万岁，万万岁。
