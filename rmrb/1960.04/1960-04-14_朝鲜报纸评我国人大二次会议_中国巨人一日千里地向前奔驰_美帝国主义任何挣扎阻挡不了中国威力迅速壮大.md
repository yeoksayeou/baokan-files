Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 12th:  The "Rodong Sinmun" of North Korea published a commentary today entitled "The Great Determination of the Chinese People," stating that the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress of China demonstrated the great achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction and their great determination to continue the Great Leap Forward in the future, and showed that no force can stop the great China from rapidly becoming a country with modernized industry, modernized agriculture, and modernized science and culture.

The commentary stated that the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people today in socialist construction are the result of the Chinese people, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, holding high the red flags of the general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, bravely overcoming difficulties, and carrying out resolute struggles.

The commentary stated that this meeting has more clearly shown the world that the People's Republic of China, in the posture of a giant, is racing forward along the road of prosperity and development without stopping and at a tremendous pace.

The commentary stated that China's strength and consolidation have a decisive impact on the development of the situation in Asia and the Far East. Its existence and its consistent peaceful diplomatic policy are a powerful guarantee for maintaining peace in Asia and stopping the mad war policies of U.S. imperialism.

The commentary pointed out that U.S. imperialism has launched vicious and despicable slander and libel against China in recent years, forcibly occupying Taiwan, an inalienable part of Chinese territory, carrying out provocative actions against China, and engaging in various conspiracies to create "two Chinas." The commentary stated that all these ugly activities of U.S. imperialism are bound to suffer a shameful bankruptcy. No amount of struggle by U.S. imperialism can stop the rapid growth of the People's Republic of China's power and the increasing enhancement of its international status.

The commentary continued, saying that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal on concluding a treaty of mutual non-aggression among countries in Asia and the Pacific region and making this region a nuclear-free zone will be welcomed by a wider range of Asian people and people of the world. The Chinese government's repeatedly stated firm stance of fighting against the aggression and war policies of U.S. imperialism has inspired the confidence of the people in the Far East and Asia in maintaining peace.

The commentary concluded by saying that the Korean people are delighted that the Chinese government has once again expressed its full support for the just struggle of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The unbreakable militant friendship between the people of Korea and China is a powerful guarantee for stopping U.S. imperialist aggression, maintaining peace in the Far East, and promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea.

The "Minju Choson" (Democratic Korea) newspaper published a commentary today entitled "The Power of the Steel-Like Unity of the Great Chinese People," stating that the Korean people are very happy about the achievements of this Chinese meeting of great significance, as if they were their own achievements. The commentary stated that the Chinese Communist Party's general line on socialist construction has been grasped by the Chinese people and has been transformed into a great material force. Holding high the red flag of the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction have had a wide impact internationally and have been praised by hundreds of millions of people. China's peaceful diplomatic policy has been tested by history and is now understood and supported by more people. The commentary pointed out that the aggressive group headed by U.S. imperialism and their running dogs are trembling with fear at the growing and powerful strength of the Chinese people.
