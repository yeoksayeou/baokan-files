(Reported by our newspaper) Hebei Province is widely promoting low-pressure steam waterwheels, which are powerfully supporting the current fight against drought. Hebei Province plans to manufacture 400,000 horsepower of low-pressure steam waterwheels in the second quarter of this year to replace manual waterwheels for irrigation.

The low-pressure steam waterwheel was first successfully created by Zhang Xinrong, a farmer from the Yangsi Production Team of the Cheng'an Commune in Ci County. During the fight against drought, Ningjin, Xinle, Gaoyang and other counties improved the boiler of the low-pressure steam engine, as well as the gears, axle bushings, and other components of the waterwheel, gradually perfecting it. This low-pressure steam waterwheel consists of a slightly modified small five-wheel waterwheel and a low-pressure steam engine. It only needs one atmosphere of pressure to start the machine, and two to three atmospheres to lift water, while a boiler-camel machine requires five to six atmospheres to lift water.

The low-pressure steam engine also has the following advantages: First, a low-pressure steam waterwheel can irrigate 20 to 30 mu of land per day, which is more than four times the efficiency of an animal-powered waterwheel, and roughly equivalent to a 3.5 horsepower boiler-camel machine. Second, it does not require steel. The main component of the low-pressure steam engine, the steam boiler, can be made from waste oil drums or cast with only 200 jin of pig iron; the waterwheel castings only require more than 300 kilograms of pig iron, and other components can be replaced with wood and pottery. Third, the structure is simple, and can be manufactured by people's commune repair shops. Fourth, it can use firewood and thatch as fuel. If thatch is used as fuel, only more than 350 jin are needed to irrigate 20 to 30 mu of land per day, while a boiler-camel machine of the same horsepower requires more than 300 kilograms of coal per day. Fifth, it has a wide range of applications and can be used in machine wells, brick wells, and canals. It can be used for both drainage and irrigation, and can also provide power for processing rice, flour, and feed in rural areas. Sixth, it is easy to operate, farmers can learn it quickly, and even semi-able-bodied laborers can operate it. Seventh, the cost is low, only about 250 yuan per low-pressure steam waterwheel.

The low-pressure steam waterwheel has received attention from party committees at all levels and is widely welcomed by the broad masses of farmers in the fight against drought. Party committees in various regions have held on-site meetings to summarize and promote experience, rapidly forming a high tide in the rush to manufacture low-pressure steam waterwheels. In the Shijiazhuang area, more than 50,000 workers and farmers were mobilized to rush production day and night, and the broad masses enthusiastically invested materials and capital in the rush to manufacture low-pressure steam waterwheels. According to statistics from only six counties in this area, including Ningjin, Zhengding, and Hengshui, the masses invested more than 20,000 cubic meters of wood and more than 900 tons of iron and steel. In more than two months, Shulu and Xinle counties manufactured more than 1,500 low-pressure steam waterwheels. From February to now, the Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and Handan areas alone have produced and modified more than 6,000 low-pressure steam waterwheels, playing a huge role in the fight against drought.

    河北大造低压蒸汽水车支援抗旱
    这种水车只要二至三个气压即可提水浇灌；构造简单、不用钢材、燃料广、操作易、成本低
    本报讯　河北省各地普遍推广低压蒸汽水车，有力地支持了当前的抗旱斗争。河北省计划在今年第二季度制造四十万马力的低压蒸汽水车，以代替人力推水车浇地。
    低压蒸汽水车，最先是磁县成安公社杨寺生产队农民张新荣创造成功的；在抗旱斗争中，又经过宁晋、新乐、高阳县等地改进了低压蒸汽机的锅炉，水车的齿轮、轴碗等部件，使之逐渐完善起来。这种低压蒸汽水车是由稍加改动后的小五轮水车和一台低压蒸汽机组成的，它只需要一个气压就可发动机器，二至三个气压即可提水，而锅驼机则需要五至六个气压才能提水。
    低压蒸汽机还有以下优点：一、一台低压蒸汽水车一天能浇地二、三十亩，比畜力水车功效高四倍以上，约等于一台三点五马力锅驼机。二、不用钢材。低压蒸汽机的主要构件蒸汽锅炉是用废油桶或只用二百斤生铁就可铸造成；水车铸件只用三百多公斤生铁，其它部件可用木材和陶磁代替。三、构造简单，人民公社修配厂就能制造。四、能用木柴、茅草作燃料。如用茅柴作燃料，一天只用三百五十多斤就能浇地二、三十亩，而同样马力的锅驼机每天就要烧三百多公斤煤。五、适用范围广，机井、砖井、渠道都可使用。排水灌溉都可以，还可为农村加工米面、饲料作动力。六、容易操作，农民一学就会，半劳力也能操纵。七、成本低，一台低压蒸汽水车只要二百五十元左右。
    低压蒸汽水车，在抗旱斗争中受到各级党委的重视和广大农民的普遍欢迎。各地党委都召开现场会议，总结推广经验，使赶制低压蒸汽水车迅速形成高潮。石家庄地区动员了五万多工人、农民日夜赶制，广大群众都热情洋溢地为赶制低压蒸汽水车投料、投资。仅据这个地区的宁晋、正定、衡水等六个县统计，群众投木料二万多立方米，钢铁九百多吨。束鹿、新乐两县在两个多月时间内就制成低压蒸汽水车一千五百多台。从2月份到现在，仅石家庄、保定、邯郸地区，就生产和改制低压蒸汽水车六千多台，在抗旱斗争中发挥了巨大威力。（附图片）
