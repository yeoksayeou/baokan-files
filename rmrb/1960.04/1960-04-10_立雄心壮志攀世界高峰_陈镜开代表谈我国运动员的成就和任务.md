Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:
    I fully agree with and support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. As an athlete of the great Mao Zedong era, we are constantly encouraged and inspired by the booming socialist construction of our motherland and its leaps and bounds of development. Under the radiant guidance of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, an unprecedented surge of continuous leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production has emerged in our country, and the people's communes have been firmly established and are developing day by day. The people of the whole country are full of energy and soaring ambition, giving full play to the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, and are rapidly building our motherland into a prosperous, strong, and great socialist country.

    The great Party and the great leader Chairman Mao have created a happy life and a brilliant future for the Chinese people, leading the people of the whole country from one victory to another. Under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, our athletes are striding forward together with the people of the whole country. Before liberation, the Chinese people were physically weak, and sports achievements were very backward. Now, the Chinese people, who have stood up, have not only thoroughly turned themselves over politically, and improved their economic life, but also have significantly enhanced their physical fitness. Mass sports activities have flourished, and hundreds of millions of people regularly participate in physical exercise. From among the vast number of sports enthusiasts, outstanding athletes have emerged in large numbers, and sports achievements are improving rapidly with each passing day. The young athletes of New China have appeared before athletes from all countries in the posture of an unexpected new force.

    Especially since 1958, under the radiant guidance of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, and inspired by the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, Chinese athletes have been full of energy and have continuously created new achievements. Before 1957, Chinese athletes broke three world records six times in three events, while in the Great Leap Forward years of 1958 and 1959, a total of forty-eight people created and broke twenty-six world records in eighteen events including weightlifting, swimming, shooting, mountaineering, model aviation, and parachuting, and won the world championship in men's singles table tennis. In 1959, Chinese athletes won one hundred and thirty-three individual first places in international competitions in track and field, skating, swimming, shooting, and motorcycle racing. In 1958 and 1959 alone, national records in various sports were broken more than two thousand one hundred times, exceeding the total number of records broken before 1957. Last year, at the First National Games held to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, seven athletes broke four world records and six hundred and sixty-four athletes broke national records eight hundred and forty-four times in one hundred and six individual events in just two weeks. Such a large-scale harvest in sports is unprecedented in the history of our country. Chinese basketball players have always demonstrated a brave, tenacious, resourceful, and flexible fighting style, and have made great progress in the past two years, winning many victories in competitions with strong international teams last year. Women mountaineering team members, after only one or two years of training, climbed to the summit of Mount Muztagh Ata, known as the "Father of Ice Mountains," at 7,546 meters last year, setting a world record for women's mountaineering. China's mountaineering movement, which is only four or five years old, has surpassed capitalist countries with decades or even hundreds of years of mountaineering history. China's women's parachuting movement has continuously created new world records. All this fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, paving a broad path for the rapid improvement of China's sports technical level. Now, the international sports community often comments on Chinese athletes as "another strong opponent on the international competition field."

    Living in this great era, we young athletes feel infinitely happy. All our achievements are the result of the Party's and Chairman Mao's leadership and care. Without the Party's and Chairman Mao's concern for sports, without the nurturing of our strong socialist motherland and people, none of our achievements would have been possible. It is the Party's and Chairman Mao's constant teachings that have made us realize that sports are an integral part of the entire socialist cause, an important means of enhancing people's physique, serving production and national defense, changing people's mental outlook, transforming customs, and transforming the world. We have learned and inherited the revolutionary predecessors' spirit of arduous struggle, despising difficulties and studying and practicing hard in daily training, and fearing no strong opponents and striving for victory in competitions. Many of our comrades have soberly seized opportunities and defeated opponents in extremely tense moments of victory or defeat, and have gritted their teeth and persevered when their physical strength has been exhausted. The reason we can do this is none other than that we have constantly drawn strength from the great Party and Chairman Mao, and from the great motherland and people. I, as well as Rong Guotuan, who won the world championship in men's singles table tennis, and many other athletes, have had deep feelings about this during the six times I broke world records. When our competition enters the most tense and difficult moment, we think of Chairman Mao and other Party and state leaders' earnest teachings and encouragement, we think of the honor of our great motherland, and we think of the six hundred and fifty million people backing us, and we are full of energy and feel that we have the strength to overcome any difficulties. At the end of last year, China's seventeen- and eighteen-year-old table tennis players went on an expedition to the United Kingdom, and they thought that since our country would catch up with the United Kingdom in industry in about ten years, we should also show the spirit of Chinese athletes in table tennis matches. As a result, they achieved five wins and one draw in six matches, causing a small sensation in the sports community in the United Kingdom. Overseas Chinese in the United Kingdom excitedly sent a banner of "威震海外" (lit. awes the world) to encourage the young players.

    Chinese athletes are relatively young and not very mature in all aspects, and need to continue to work hard and make continuous progress. The level of various sports in our country has not been improved comprehensively enough, and the results of some events are not ideal enough. Our achievements are not very commensurate with the achievements of our motherland in all aspects. In front of Chinese athletes, there are both broad roads and arduous tasks. We must never become complacent because of small achievements. We must use the idea of continuous revolution to guide our actions, listen to the Party, study more seriously, and exercise more diligently. We must continue to break superstitions, emancipate our minds, carry forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, vigorously carry out technical innovation, and use our wisdom and strength to create unique styles of technology and tactics suitable for us in various sports events. We must also carry out revolutionary competitions to learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward, to drive the broad masses to participate in sports activities, and drive the athletes who are younger than us to master advanced technology and improve their results. The Chinese people on the industrial, agricultural, and other fronts have fully demonstrated their ambition to move mountains and overturn seas in this glorious era of sustained Great Leap Forward. On the sports front, we thousands of athletes also have the ambition to quickly climb to the top of the world's sports technology level.

    Now, a high tide of studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works is also being set off among the vast number of athletes, which will have a huge impact on further improving our political and ideological level, establishing and consolidating the proletarian world outlook, and implementing the invincible Mao Zedong Thought into our training and competitions.

    Chinese athletes are determined to be red and expert red athletes. We must continue to plant red flags, boost our energy, improve our sports level at high speed, and be sure to create more world records and produce more world champions.

    Finally, I wish all representatives good health.

    立雄心壮志攀世界高峰
    陈镜开代表谈我国运动员的成就和任务主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告和人大常委会的工作报告。作为一个伟大的毛泽东时代的运动员，我们无时无刻不为祖国轰轰烈烈的社会主义建设事业飞跃发展而感到欢欣鼓舞。在党的社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，我国出现了史无前例的工农业生产持续大跃进的澎湃景象，人民公社已经巩固地建立起来，并正在日益发展。全国人民干劲冲天，壮志凌云，充分发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标，正在高速度地把我们的祖国建设成为繁荣、富强的伟大的社会主义国家。
    伟大的党和伟大的领袖毛主席，给我国人民创造了幸福的生活和灿烂的前景，引导全国人民从一个胜利走向又一个胜利。我们广大运动员在党和毛主席的教导下，正和全国人民一起阔步前进。　  解放以前，我国人民体质孱弱，运动成绩十分落后。现在，站起来了的中国人民，不仅在政治上彻底翻了身，经济生活得到了提高和改善，而且在体质上也有了显著的增强。群众性的体育运动已经蓬勃开展起来，亿万人经常参加体育锻炼。从广大的体育锻炼积极分子中间，优秀运动员大量涌现，运动成绩日新又新，突飞猛进。新中国的年青运动员队伍，以异军突起的姿态，出现在各国运动员面前。　  特别是1958年以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进和人民公社化运动的鼓舞下，我国运动员干劲十足的不断创造出新的成绩。在1957年以前，我国运动员有三人六次打破三项世界纪录，而在大跃进的1958年和1959年，共有四十八人在举重、游泳、射击、登山、航空模型、跳伞等十八个项目中创造和打破二十六次世界纪录，并且获得了乒乓球男子单打世界冠军。1959年，我国运动员在参加田径、滑冰、游泳、射击、摩托车等项的国际比赛中，就获得了一百三十三个单项的第一。在1958和1959两年中，打破各项运动全国纪录二千一百多次，超过1957年以前破纪录的总和。去年，为迎接伟大祖国建国十周年节日而举行的第一届全国运动会，在短短的两个星期的时间内，就有七名运动员打破四项世界纪录，六百六十四名运动员八百四十四次打破一百零六个单项的全国纪录。这种体育运动上的大面积丰收，在我国历史上是空前的。我国的篮球运动员，历年来都表现出勇敢顽强，机智灵活的战斗作风，近两年更有长足的进步，去年多次和国际强队比赛，获得了很大胜利。女子登山队员只经过一、两年的锻炼，去年就登上了七千五百四十六米号称“冰山之父”的慕士塔格山顶峰，创造了女子登山的世界纪录。只有四、五年历史的我国登山运动，已经超过有数十年乃至上百年登山历史的资本主义国家。我国的女子跳伞运动，不断地创造出新的世界纪录。这一切，充分证明了社会主义制度的无比优越，为我国运动技术水平的迅速提高，开辟了广阔的途径。现在，国际体育界常常用“国际竞赛场上又多了一个有力的对手”来评论新中国的运动员。
    生活在这个伟大的时代里，我们年青一代的运动员深深感到无限的幸福。我们所有的成绩，都是党和毛主席领导关怀的结果，没有党和毛主席对体育事业的关怀，没有强大的社会主义祖国和人民对我们的孕育，我们的一切成绩都是不可能取得的。是党和毛主席的不断教导，使我们认识到体育运动是整个社会主义事业的一个组成部分，是增强人民体质，为生产和国防服务，改变人民精神面貌，移风易俗，改造世界的重要手段。我们学习和继承了革命前辈艰苦顽强的奋斗精神，在平日锻炼中，藐视困难，苦学苦练，在比赛中，不怕强手，力争胜利。我们许多同志在极端紧张的胜败关头，头脑清醒地抓住战机，击败对手，在体力已经不支的时候，咬紧牙关，坚持不渝，能够做到这点，不是别的，正是由于我们经常从伟大的党和毛主席那里，从伟大的祖国和人民那里吸取了力量，我在六次打破世界纪录的过程中，以及获得乒乓男子单打世界冠军的容国团和其他许多选手都有着很深的感受。当我们的竞赛进入最紧张，最困难的时刻，我们想到毛主席和其它党和国家的领袖对我们的谆谆教导和鼓励，想到我们伟大祖国的荣誉，想到有六亿五千万人民作我们的后盾，就浑身有劲，感到有一股什么困难都能克服的力量。去年年底，我国十七、八岁的乒乓球小将们，远征英国，他们想到我国在工业上要用十年左右的时间赶上英国，在乒乓球的比赛上，也应当表现出我国运动员的干劲。结果六场比赛，取得五胜一平的战绩，在英国的体育界引起一场不小的震动。在英国的华侨兴奋地送了一面“威震海外”的锦旗鼓励小将们。
    我国的运动员都比较年青，各方面都不很成熟，需要继续努力，不断进步。我国各项运动的水平提高得还不够全面，有些项目的成绩也不够理想，我们的成绩和祖国各方面的成就还不很相称。在我国运动员面前，既有广阔的道路，也有艰巨的任务。我们决不因为点滴的成就就骄傲自满起来。我们要用不断革命的思想指导我们的行动，听党的话，更加认真的学习，更加刻苦的锻炼。我们要继续破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，大搞技术革新，在各种运动项目上，用我们的智慧和力量，创造适合我们的技术和战术的独特风格。我们也要开展学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进的革命竞赛，带动广大的群众，参加体育运动，带动比我们更年青一些的运动员掌握先进技术，提高成绩。在工业、农业和其它战线上的我国人民，在这个持续大跃进的光辉年代里，都充分显示了移山倒海的雄心，在体育战线上，我们千千万万的运动员，也有迅速攀登世界运动技术水平顶峰的壮志。
    现在，在广大的运动员中，也正掀起了学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作的高潮，这对进一步提高我们的政治思想水平，树立和巩固无产阶级的世界观，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想贯彻到我们的训练和比赛中，将会发生巨大的影响。
    我国运动员，决心做一个又红又专的红色运动员。要继续大插红旗、大鼓干劲，高速度提高运动水平，一定要创造出更多的世界纪录，出现更多的世界冠军。
    最后祝各位代表身体健康。
