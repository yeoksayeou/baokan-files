Strive to Realize the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule
Report at the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress on April 6, 1960
Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council

Fellow Deputies:
I am entrusted by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to report to the Congress on the implementation of the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967 and the effort to realize this program ahead of schedule.

I.

The National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967 was proposed by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee based on the initiative of Comrade Mao Zedong. It was published as a draft in January 1956. In September 1957, the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee made some necessary revisions and supplements based on the changes in the situation and the development of work in the nearly two years since the draft was published, and the revised draft of the program was published in October of the same year. The national farmers and the people of the whole country have been working hard to implement the agricultural development program for four years now.

The National Agricultural Development Program is a program for developing China's socialist agricultural production and construction at high speed. This program stipulates the requirements for greatly increasing agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production in China within a short period of time. It stipulates various effective measures to achieve this requirement, and formulates plans for carrying out construction in rural culture, education, health, and other aspects on the basis of developing production. It points out to the national farmers and the people of the whole country the great goal of changing the face of China's countryside. After the draft of this program was first published in January 1956, it was warmly supported by the vast number of farmers and the entire people, and played a great role in promoting the upsurge of agricultural cooperation and the upsurge of agricultural production at that time. The publication of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program in October 1957 once again promoted a new upsurge in agricultural production and construction, first of all, it set off a mass movement of large-scale water conservancy construction in China that had never been seen in history. Facts have fully proved that this program is a mass program, which can mobilize the enthusiasm of the broadest masses to develop China's agriculture and build China's new socialist countryside. The struggle of the people of the whole country to realize this program has not only created a leap forward situation on the agricultural front, but also promoted the development of the leap forward situation of the entire national economy through the leap forward in agriculture.

In May 1958, the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, formulated the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and put forward the call to break down superstitions, emancipate the mind, and carry forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to do. Since then, a new situation of a great leap forward in China's socialist construction has been opened up. Under this new situation, the rural areas across the country generally realized the people's commune system in the second half of 1958.

The people's commune is a great creation made by the Chinese people according to actual needs. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong attached great importance to and timely grasped this creation of the masses, concentrated it, persisted in it, and guided it to develop along a healthy road with correct policies. The realization of the rural people's commune system has brought about tremendous and profound changes in China's rural areas.

The rural people's commune was developed on the basis of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, and its scale is much larger than that of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives. At the beginning of 1958, there were more than 740,000 advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives in the country, which have now been merged and reorganized into more than 24,000 people's communes. On average, a people's commune has 64,000 mu of cultivated land, 5,000 peasant households, and 10,000 laborers, which is equivalent to 30 times the average scale of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives. In the past, the scope of operation of the vast majority of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives was relatively narrow. The current rural people's commune is not only an economic organization that engages in multiple operations of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, but also a basic social organization that combines industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and combines government administration with commune management. The people's commune is still under collective ownership at this stage, and implements a three-level ownership system within the commune, with the ownership of the production team as the foundation. However, its degree of public ownership is already higher than that of advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives. It already has a part of the commune ownership that the original advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives did not have, and this part of the commune ownership will gradually expand with the development of the entire agricultural production. In the future, the people's commune will be the best form for China's rural areas to transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and it is also the best form for China to transition from socialist society to communist society.

Due to the advantages of being large in size and high in the degree of public ownership, the people's commune can uniformly arrange production and distribution within a larger scope than advanced cooperatives. It can more effectively and fully mobilize and rationally arrange rural labor, can carry out large-scale cooperation, and can undertake construction that advanced cooperatives were unable to undertake in the past. Adapting to the increase in the degree of collectivization of production, the collectivization of rural life has also greatly developed. Collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly have been widely established, and the socialization of household labor has been widely realized, liberating tens of thousands of women from household labor and enabling them to participate in social production. In terms of the distribution system, the people's commune basically implements the wage system of distribution according to labor, and at the same time implements the supply system with the nature of embryonic distribution according to needs. This distribution system combining wages and supply greatly increased the enthusiasm of farmers for production, well solved the difficulties of families with many children and other families with heavy burdens, enabled the elderly to have support, enabled children to receive better education, and generally guaranteed the lives of the vast number of farmers.

The realization of the rural people's commune system has opened up broad avenues for greater development of productive forces, enabling us to achieve continuous great leaps forward in agricultural production in 1958 and 1959, with grain increasing by 46 percent and cotton increasing by 47 percent in two years. In these two years of great leaps forward, the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery, and commune-run industrial production has greatly accelerated, farmland water conservancy and rural transportation construction have greatly developed, measures for increasing agricultural production have been further enriched in practice, capital accumulation has increased, the lives of farmers have been further improved, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings have been rapidly developed. The socialist consciousness of the broad masses has been significantly improved, which has accelerated the process of realizing the agricultural development program. Give full play to the superiority of this social organizational form of the rural people's commune, mobilize the national farmers and the people of the whole country to carry out unremitting struggle from all aspects, and we will be fully capable of continuing to maintain the leap forward speed of agricultural production and construction, and we will be fully capable of realizing the agricultural development program originally planned to be realized in twelve years two or three years ahead of schedule.

II.

First, I will talk about the implementation of the agricultural development program in the past four years.

The National Agricultural Development Program requires that, starting from 1956, within twelve years, the average annual yield of grain per mu should reach 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin respectively in three different regions. This is the center of the forty-point program. In 1959, there were already 504 counties (including banners, cities, and districts under large cities equivalent to counties, the same below) that reached and exceeded this provision of the program, accounting for 28 percent of the 1,786 counties in the country; there were already 286,777,000 mu of grain cultivated land, accounting for 24 percent of the existing 1.2 billion mu of grain cultivated land in the country.

The National Agricultural Development Program requires that the yield of cotton per mu should reach 40 jin, 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin of ginned cotton respectively within twelve years, according to different conditions. In 1959, there were 45 counties and 7,613,000 mu of cotton fields with a yield of more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu; 55 counties and 10,448,000 mu of cotton fields with 80 jin to 99 jin; 104 counties and 18,423,000 mu of cotton fields with 60 jin to 79 jin; as for those below 60 jin, many places did not make separate statistics with 40 jin as the boundary. Because the yield per mu of the vast majority of cotton fields exceeded 40 jin, those below 40 jin were mainly newly developed cotton fields. In total, there were 204 counties with a yield of 60 jin, 80 jin, or more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, accounting for 20 percent of the 1,027 cotton-growing counties in the country; there were 36,484,000 mu of cotton fields, accounting for 42 percent of the actual harvested area of more than 85 million mu of cotton fields.

In addition to grain and cotton, various crops such as oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, medicines, and miscellaneous crops have also increased to varying degrees in the past few years. In 1959, there were 270 million pigs raised throughout the year, and 180 million pigs in stock at the end of the year; with 120 million peasant households in the country, the average number of pigs in stock at the end of the year was 1.5 pigs per household, and the average number of pigs raised throughout the year was more than 2 pigs per household, reaching the standard required by the program to be reached in 1962 ahead of schedule. Since last October, a mass pig-raising movement has been launched throughout the country, and a high tide of comprehensively developing animal husbandry with pig-raising as the head has been set off. According to statistics in early March this year, there were more than 17 million pregnant large livestock in the country, which is the basis for the great development of livestock such as cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules this year. In 1958 and 1959, 540 million mu of forests were planted. The content of mountain production has exceeded the scope of combining agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. Some places have developed fishery production in mountainous areas by using mountain valley reservoirs, and some places have established small-scale local production or a combination of local and foreign production of forest chemical industry and other industries, and carried out the "Wanbaoshan" movement. The sideline production of the people's commune has also developed faster than in the past cooperative era, and some local specialties and handicrafts that have been out of production for a long time have been restored. The rural people's communes across the country earned several billion yuan in the "small autumn harvest" movement and short-distance transportation movement in the winter of last year. The output of marine and freshwater fishery production reached 5.02 million tons in 1959, an increase of 1.9 million tons compared with 3.12 million tons in 1957. The output value of rural industries run by people's communes reached about 10 billion yuan in 1959. Commune-run industry is a newly emerging economic sector after the realization of the people's commune system in rural areas, which was not originally planned in the National Agricultural Development Program.

Due to the great development of diversified operations in the people's commune, the agricultural output value in 1959 reached 78.3 billion yuan (excluding the output value of commune-run industry of 10 billion yuan), which increased not only the public accumulation of the commune, but also the personal income of the members. In addition to taxes, public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and various production expenses, the average income per person in the country's rural population in 1959 was about 85 yuan, catching up with the average income level of well-to-do middle peasants before agricultural cooperation (80 yuan per person), reaching the target required by the program to be reached around 1962 ahead of schedule. This is the national average level, and many prosperous areas have exceeded this level of 85 yuan, and there are also a considerable number of areas below this level.

In terms of measures to increase agricultural production, Comrade Mao Zedong, in the great leap forward of 1958, applied the principles of advanced agricultural science, summarized the rich experience of farmers' production practice, and put forward the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture" of soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, close planting, protection, management, and tools. The content of the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture" is richer and more complete than the various measures to increase production stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program. In the past two years, people's communes in various places have generally implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture." Starting from the winter of 1957, tens of millions of people went into battle to build water conservancy projects on a large scale, increasing the irrigated area by 550 million mu in two years, plus the original irrigated area, reaching a total of 1.007 billion mu. Among them, 610 million mu have reached the standards stipulated in the program for drought resistance capacity of 30 days, 50 days, and 70 days respectively. In terms of fertilizer, we have developed pig raising, expanded the green manure area, and the commune has established many local fertilizer plants, and some communes have also established small foreign fertilizer plants with an annual output of 800 tons of synthetic ammonia (equivalent to 3,000 tons of ammonium sulfate). The state has invested in the construction of some modern fertilizer plants, which has greatly increased organic and inorganic fertilizers. In terms of soil improvement, there are more than 700 million mu of low-lying and waterlogged land and various low-yielding fields in the country, and 450 million mu have been initially improved, accounting for 60 percent. The area with relatively serious soil erosion is 1.5 million square kilometers, and 600,000 square kilometers have been initially treated with soil and water conservation measures, accounting for 40 percent. In the past two years, a mass soil survey movement has also been widely carried out. Various places are scientifically analyzing the data obtained from the survey, studying measures such as improving soil according to local conditions, planting according to local conditions, and fertilizing according to local conditions, and gradually compiling land use plans by commune and by team, and establishing land archives by plot. This is a very valuable basic farmland construction that is both mass-based and scientific. The area of improved varieties of various crops reached 1.8 billion mu in 1959, accounting for 80 percent of the total sown area. Improved varieties of major crops such as cotton, wheat, rice, and potatoes have been basically popularized. People's communes in various places have established more than 54 million mu of seed bases. Rational close planting has been widely promoted, and the problems of over-dense and over-sparse planting are becoming less and less, and the law of rational close planting is being mastered by more and more people. The National Agricultural Development Program requires that eleven kinds of plant diseases and insect pests that are basically eliminated within seven or twelve years, among which cotton aphids and red spiders have basically achieved the requirement of no leaf curling and no red leaves in concentrated cotton-producing areas, reaching the requirement of eliminating the harm; locusts and armyworms are also basically controlled, so as not to harm; the damage loss rate of others such as wheat smut and rice borers has generally been reduced to below 2 percent. Many places have also created disease-free and pest-free areas of tens of thousands of mu and hundreds of thousands of mu of contiguous cultivated land. The program requires that eight kinds of the most serious diseases and epidemics that endanger livestock are basically eliminated within seven or twelve years, among which cattle plague has been basically eliminated, and the incidence of diseases such as swine fever, chicken plague, and bovine pleuropneumonia has also been significantly reduced. The movement of agricultural production tool reform has also made great achievements in the past few years, and has created a variety of new agricultural tools such as rice transplanters. By the end of 1959, more than 520 million pieces of various improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools had been promoted, which played a considerable role in improving agricultural labor productivity. There have also been new developments in field management and intensive cultivation. People's communes in various places are carrying out large-scale high-yield plots and gardenization. The farmers said: The ridges are as straight as lines, the ground is as flat as a mirror, deep plowing, close planting, good seeds, rational fertilization, rational irrigation, intensive cultivation, weed eradication, insect eradication, and disease eradication, making the large fields as like vegetable gardens. The Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture, which came from the masses, has returned to the masses and has become a classic of agricultural production. In addition, the program proposed a variety of high-yielding crops, increasing the multiple cropping index, expanding the cultivated land area, and running state-owned farms well, all of which have made considerable achievements in the past four years. The meteorological station network, hydrological observation station network, and local road network serving agriculture, which the program requires to be completed within twelve years, have also taken shape, and many places have achieved them ahead of schedule.

The results of the implementation of the program's requirements for developing science, education, culture, and health in rural areas in the past few years have also been very significant. By 1959, more than 110 million young and middle-aged people had shaken off the status of illiteracy, accounting for two-thirds of the total number of young and middle-aged people in rural areas. Commune-run primary schools, team-run primary schools, and rural primary education have been basically popularized. People's communes in various places have also established more than 30,000 agricultural middle schools, with 2.96 million students enrolled, averaging 1.2 agricultural middle schools per commune and about 120 students, which is the foundation and beginning for further popularizing middle school education in rural areas. People's communes have also established various spare-time schools and red-and-expert schools. Agricultural scientific research has become a mass activity of farmers. According to incomplete statistics from twelve provinces, there are 7,690 agricultural scientific research organizations run by communes, with more than 38,000 employees. A national agricultural scientific research network based on people's communes has basically taken shape. Many agricultural labor models, who were originally illiterate or had little literacy, have now become researchers at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences or provincial branch academies (institutes), members of agricultural societies, or are hired to teach at universities. Rural radio networks and telephone networks, and postal networks, have been basically popularized except for a few remote areas.

The achievements of the movement to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene are obvious to all and widely praised. Jishan County in Shanxi Province and Foshan City in Guangdong Province are typical examples of counties and cities that have basically eliminated the four pests. Sparrows have been almost wiped out, grain production has increased year by year, and the harm of sparrows to grain production has been greatly reduced; at the same time, the area of ​​forests and fruit trees has greatly developed, and sparrows are the "natural enemies" of pests of forests and fruit trees, so sparrows should not be killed anymore. The sparrow in the four pests to be eliminated mentioned in the program should be changed to bed bugs. The program requires that the diseases that are basically eliminated and actively prevented in twelve years, some of which have been basically eliminated and prevented (such as smallpox, plague, etc.), 70 percent of the patients with schistosomiasis have been treated, and the incidence of other diseases has also been greatly reduced.

The program's requirements for protecting women and children and implementing the "Five Guarantees," etc., have actually exceeded the requirements of the program due to the implementation of the distribution system combining wages and supply in the people's commune, the large-scale establishment of public canteens, nurseries, maternity homes, and homes for the elderly, etc.

In short, the actual results of the implementation of the National Agricultural Development Program in the past four years are: some of the contents of the program have been surpassed by actual life, some requirements have been basically realized, largely realized, or realized in some areas, which is a great victory. These victories have been mainly achieved in the past two years under the three red flags of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune. With these victories, we have laid the foundation for realizing the agricultural development program ahead of schedule.

On the other hand, we must also see that realizing the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule is not an easy task. First of all, more than 70 percent of the counties have not reached the level required by the program for the average annual yield of grain per mu. The total grain output of the country has increased by 190.5 billion jin in the past four years, that is, from 349.6 billion jin in 1955 to 540.1 billion jin in 1959. However, according to the level required by the program, the total grain output of the country should be 720 billion jin to 750 billion jin, which requires an increase of more than 180 billion jin on the basis of the total grain output of 1959, that is, an increase of more than one-third. This still requires great effort. Reaching 720 billion jin, with an average of 1,000 jin or slightly more per person, is certainly a great leap forward compared with the past; but we cannot therefore think that the grain problem has been solved, and we should further strive to achieve an average of at least 1,500 jin of grain per person. The output of cotton needs to make great efforts to meet the requirements of the program, and it also needs to make further efforts after meeting the requirements of the program.

In terms of measures to increase production, we still have a lot of work to do. For example, water conservancy and irrigation, building a reservoir does not mean that the irrigated area calculated according to the project has already received actual benefits. We must also store water, build canals, level the land, and prepare water lifting tools to actually exert benefits. Some projects, especially large-scale projects, may not be able to exert benefits in the current year, or may not be able to fully exert benefits, and often it takes until the second year or even the third year to fully exert benefits. We must continue to work hard to realize the requirement of the program to achieve an irrigated area of ​​900 million mu within twelve years that can fully exert benefits. But realizing the requirements of the program can only "avoid ordinary floods and droughts" as the program says. Therefore, we must further work hard. Carrying out soil and water conservation engineering measures and biological measures does not mean completely controlling soil erosion. The trees and grass that are planted must survive, the root system must spread, and the canopy must grow to achieve the actual effect of maintaining soil and water and conserving water sources. There is still a long process from afforestation to achieving greening. Many places have very few trees planted now, and those that have been planted must also survive, be cultivated well, and grow up to truly achieve greening.

The program proposes the basic elimination and active prevention of plant diseases and insect pests, the basic elimination of the most serious diseases that endanger livestock, the basic elimination and active prevention of the diseases that endanger the people most seriously, and the basic elimination of requirements for mice, bed bugs, flies, mosquitoes, etc., all require long-term, regular, and repeated efforts. Because these things are not wiped out once and never reborn, but they are reborn after being eliminated, and they must be eliminated again after being reborn.

The program requires that the state, collectives, and individuals should store enough grain for one to two years respectively. Before the grain output is greatly increased, a part can certainly be stored, but storing this much cannot be achieved in the short term. Repairing and building new houses to improve the living conditions of the members is something that must be done, but in the next few years, the funds of the commune should still be mainly used for productive capital construction, and new houses for the members can only be built gradually. In these aspects, we still have to make relatively long-term efforts to realize the requirements put forward by the program.

It can be seen that realizing the agricultural development program is still a major task to be completed by all farmers and the people of the whole country, and to realize it ahead of schedule, we must go through several years of hard work and fight hard for several years. Moreover, realizing the National Agricultural Development Program does not mean that agriculture has completely "passed the test." The road we have to travel is still long. We must, in the spirit of continuous revolution, under the guidance of the three red flags of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, go all out, strive hard, complete a task, and then propose a new task, and continue to forge ahead bravely.

III.

The people's commune system is the fundamental guarantee for us to realize the agricultural development program ahead of schedule. We must implement the resolutions of the CPC Central Committee on the people's commune, so that the people's commune can continue to be soundly developed. We should vigorously develop the economy of the production team, especially strengthen the leadership and assistance to the poor teams, so that they can gradually catch up with the rich teams. At the same time, under the premise of adhering to the three-level ownership system, we must actively develop the economy owned by the commune. Our future is to transition from basic ownership by the team to basic ownership by the commune, and then from basic ownership by the commune to ownership by the whole people. However, to realize this future, the necessary conditions must be met. In terms of the conditions for realizing basic ownership by the commune, first, the economic development of the whole commune has reached the level of an average annual income of 150 yuan to 200 yuan per person; second, the economic part owned by the commune accounts for the majority of the economy of the whole commune; third, the poor teams have caught up with the rich teams; fourth, the mechanization and semi-mechanization of the countryside have reached a certain degree. In order to create these conditions, we must adhere to the three-level ownership system, adhere to the distribution system mainly based on distribution according to labor, and adhere to the system of exchange of equal value. Adhering to these systems is not only conducive to the current production and construction of the people's commune, but also conducive to the gradual transition in the future; it not only meets the requirements of the current interests of the people, but also meets the requirements of the long-term interests of the people.

We must make full use of the superiority of the people's commune's unified arrangement of production, and better comprehensively develop the diversified operations of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. Each commune should, according to its own conditions, adapt to the requirements put forward by the agricultural development program. In agriculture, with grain as the key, appropriately arrange the production layout of various crops such as grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, medicines, and miscellaneous crops. In animal husbandry, we should continue to develop the pig-raising movement that has already taken shape, and with pig-raising as the head, develop cattle, sheep, horses, donkeys, mules, chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, and bee raising. In forestry, sideline production, and fishery, we should also make appropriate arrangements by category. Arranging the production layout of various aspects well can enable the entire agricultural production to be universally developed in a planned and proportional manner, and the speed of development can be faster.

Due to the realization of the rural people's commune system, vigorously promoting the technical transformation of agriculture has become an important task for the whole party and the whole people. On the one hand, we must enrich the content of the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture" day by day on the basis of the combination of advanced agricultural science and practical experience in production, so that the technical innovation and technical revolution in agricultural cultivation methods can continue to develop. On the other hand, we must accelerate the technical innovation and technical revolution in agricultural production tools, and strive to realize the mechanization of China's agriculture as soon as possible. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in May 1959 that after the realization of the rural people's commune system, "the fundamental way out for agriculture lies in mechanization," "starting from 1959, it will be solved in a small way in four years, solved in seven years, and solved in a big way in ten years." This progress is much faster than originally envisioned in the agricultural development program. The mechanization of agriculture in China is step-by-step, from improved agricultural tools, semi-mechanization to mechanization. Agricultural mechanization is also multifaceted, and the five industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery must gradually implement semi-mechanization and mechanization. Cultivation, drainage and irrigation, pest control, field transportation, and preliminary processing of agricultural products in agriculture must also gradually implement semi-mechanization and mechanization. The conditions in various places are different. In which aspects should mechanization be implemented first, and what kind of mechanical machines should be used must be adapted to local conditions, the time, and the event. Because China is a country with a large population and little arable land, and China's agriculture has a good tradition of intensive cultivation, agricultural mechanization must also be combined with the various measures of the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture," and with the good tradition of intensive cultivation, so that the result of implementing agricultural mechanization can not only improve agricultural labor productivity, but also improve the yield per unit area. The combination of mechanization and gardenization is the sign of the modernization of agricultural technology in China.

In order to promote the development of the entire agricultural technical innovation and technical revolution movement, in order to strive for the continued leap forward in agricultural production, while large modern industries must produce more means of agricultural production, we must continue to greatly develop commune-run industries. The people's commune should not only run various agricultural product processing industries, but also establish coal mining, power generation, smelting, chemical and other enterprises according to local resource conditions, produce local iron and local steel, manufacture improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools, and manufacture local fertilizers and local pesticides. The people's commune should also develop the construction of highways and local railways according to needs and possibilities. Developing commune-run industry and transportation can better implement the policy of combining industry and agriculture, can develop agricultural production and construction faster, and can change the economic and cultural face of rural areas faster.

To realize the agricultural development program ahead of schedule, we must widely mobilize the strength of all aspects. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the development of China's national economy should be based on agriculture and guided by industry, combining the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture. Accelerating the development of agriculture is an important key to developing China's national economy at a high speed and proportionally. Our agriculture is developed, and not only is light industry easier to handle, but also heavy industry is easier to handle. At the same time, the accelerated development of agriculture, especially the realization of agricultural mechanization, must have the support of industry and other departments. Realizing the agricultural development program ahead of schedule is not only a matter for hundreds of millions of farmers, but also a matter for all economic departments and all cultural and educational departments. Various departments such as industry, transportation, finance, trade, finance, science, education, culture, and health should formulate plans according to the requirements of the agricultural development program for their departments and the needs for further development of agricultural production and construction, so as to better support agricultural production and construction. And they should earnestly check the implementation situation and solve the problems that arise at any moment.

The consolidation and development of the people's commune system, the development of agricultural production and contruction, the development of science, education, culture and health in the countryside, and the support of various departments to agriculture, are all things that can be done well only by mobilizing the strength of hundreds of millions of people. Therefore, in these tasks, we must implement the Party's mass line. Leading cadres at all levels must earnestly improve their leadership style, implement the policy of running communes diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, oppose corruption, oppose waste, oppose bureaucracy and commandism, and must completely treat people with equality, adhere to the system of cadres participating in labor, completely integrate with the masses, and be good at bringing into play and relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses; they must often conduct investigations and research, understand the situation, analyze problems, and constantly improve their political level, economic theory level, and the level of analysis and understanding of actual work. Cadres of the commune must be good at grasping production and also at grasping life. They should closely care about the lives of the masses while developing production, and pay attention to the combination of work and rest. The public canteen problem is a central problem in grasping life now. By the end of 1959, 3.9 million canteens had been established in rural areas across the country, and the number of people eating in canteens was 400 million, accounting for 73 percent of the total number of people in rural people's communes. Therefore, running public canteens well is a major matter concerning the vital interests of the broadest masses. At present, most canteens are run relatively well, and the masses are satisfied. However, some canteens in some places are not enough, and some canteens are not run well enough. We must continue to run canteens on a large scale under the principle of voluntary participation, and run canteens well. Leading cadres at all levels of the commune must personally strengthen the leadership of canteen work, not just hand over this work to minor cadres. The management of the canteen should be democratic, and the accounts should be published on schedule. All canteens should raise pigs and grow vegetables, and should plan to use grain, save grain, and ensure that everyone eats their fill and eats well. Other welfare undertakings of the people's commune should also be actively run well. Some areas are preparing to run comprehensive life service stations on the basis of public canteens, nurseries and other collective welfare organizations, which is a new experience worth studying and promoting. Running these welfare undertakings well and arranging the lives of the members well can better promote the development of production.

The current situation in the country is very good. On the basis of the continuous great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, not only can we continue to make a leap forward in 1960, but also strive for sustained leaps forward throughout the 1960s. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is developing universally in all departments of urban and rural areas across the country, and will inevitably continue to rise wave after wave. The socialist enthusiasm of the 650 million people has been unprecedentedly improved. We are fully confident that under the illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, relying on the great strength and collective wisdom of the people, we will definitely be able to catch up with and surpass Britain in terms of the output of major industrial products in less than ten years, and we will definitely be able to complete and overfulfill the original requirements of the agricultural development program in less than twelve years, and on this basis, we will continue to work hard to make our rural areas get greater and greater development.

    为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗
    一九六○年四月六日在第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的报告
    中共中央书记处书记、国务院副总理　谭震林各位代表：
    我受中共中央和国务院的委托，向大会作关于一九五六年到一九六七年全国农业发展纲要的执行情况和争取提前实现这个纲要的报告。
    一
    一九五六年到一九六七年全国农业发展纲要，是中共中央政治局根据毛泽东同志的倡议提出的，在一九五六年一月以草案形式公布。一九五七年九月，中共八届三中全会，根据草案公布以后将近两年中情况的变化和工作的发展，作了一些必要的修改和补充，在同年十月间公布了纲要的修正草案。全国农民和全国人民为执行农业发展纲要而努力，到现在已经四年了。
    全国农业发展纲要是高速度地发展我国社会主义农业生产和建设的纲领，这个纲领规定了在不很长的时间内大大提高我国农、林、牧、副、渔生产的要求，规定了达到这个要求的各种有效措施，制定了在发展生产的基础上，开展农村文化、教育、卫生等各方面建设的规划，它向全国农民和全国人民指出了改变我国农村面貌的伟大目标。在一九五六年一月，这个纲要草案第一次公布以后，得到了广大农民和全体人民的热烈拥护，对于当时的农业合作化的高潮和农业生产的高潮起了极大的促进作用。一九五七年十月，全国农业发展纲要修正草案的公布，再一次推动了农业生产和建设的新高潮，首先是在全国范围内掀起了我国历史上从未有过的大兴水利的群众运动。事实完全证明，这个纲要是一个群众性的纲领，它能够调动最广大群众的积极性来发展我国的农业，建设我国的社会主义新农村。全国人民为实现这个纲领而进行的斗争，不但造成了农业战线上的跃进形势，而且通过农业的跃进，促进了整个国民经济跃进形势的发展。
    一九五八年五月，中共第八届全国代表大会第二次会议，在马克思列宁主义普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想指导下，制定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，提出了破除迷信、解放思想、发扬敢想敢做的共产主义风格的号召，从此就开辟了我国社会主义建设大跃进的新局面，在这种新局面下，全国农村在一九五八年下半年普遍地实现了人民公社化。
    人民公社是我国人民群众根据实际需要所作出的伟大创举，党中央和毛泽东同志十分重视并且及时抓住了群众的这个创举，把它集中起来，坚持下去，用正确的方针指导它沿着健康的道路向前发展。农村人民公社化的实现，使我国农村发生了巨大、深刻的变化。
    农村人民公社是在高级农业生产合作社的基础上发展起来的，它的规模比高级农业生产合作社大得多。一九五八年初全国有七十四万多个高级农业生产合作社，现在已经合并改组成为二万四千多个人民公社，平均一个人民公社拥有六万四千亩耕地，五千农户、一万个劳动力，相当于高级农业生产合作社平均规模的三十倍。过去绝大多数高级农业生产合作社，经营的范围比较狭窄，现在的农村人民公社不但是农、林、牧、副、渔多种经营的经济组织，而且是工、农、商、学、兵合一的，政社合一的社会基层组织。人民公社现阶段还是集体所有制，在公社内部实行三级所有制，而以生产队的所有制为基础。但是它的公有化程度已经比高级农业生产合作社更高，已经存在着原来高级农业合作社所没有的部分的公社所有制，而且这部分公社所有制，随着整个农业生产的发展，必将逐步扩大。在将来，人民公社是我国农村由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制的最好的形式，也是我国由社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的最好的形式。
    人民公社由于具备了一大二公的优点，就能够在比高级社更大的范围内统一安排生产和分配，能够比高级社更有效地充分动员和合理安排农村劳动力，能够进行大协作，能够举办过去高级社无力举办的建设。适应于生产集体化程度的提高，农村生活的集体化也有了很大的发展，普遍地举办了公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院等集体福利事业，普遍地实现了家务劳动的社会化，使成千成万的家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加社会生产。人民公社在分配制度方面，基本上实行按劳分配的工资制度，同时也实行带有按需分配萌芽性质的供给制度，这种工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，大大地提高了农民生产的积极性，很好地解决了多子女家庭以及其他负担较多的家庭的困难，使老有所归，使儿童得到更好的教养，使广大农民的生活普遍得到保障。
    农村人民公社化的实现，为生产力的更大发展开辟了广阔的道路，使我们在一九五八年和一九五九年取得了农业生产的连续大跃进，粮食两年增长百分之四十六，棉花两年增长百分之四十七。在这两年大跃进中，农、林、牧、副、渔和社办工业生产的发展大大加快了，农田水利、农村的交通运输建设大大地发展了，农业增产措施在实践中更加丰富了，资金积累增加了，农民生活得到了进一步的改善，文化、教育、卫生事业有了迅速的发展，广大群众的社会主义觉悟有了显著的提高，这就加快了实现农业发展纲要的进程。充分发挥农村人民公社这种社会组织形式的优越性，动员全国农民和全国人民从各方面进行坚持不懈的斗争，我们就完全有可能继续保持农业生产和建设的跃进速度，也就完全有可能提早两年或者三年实现原定在十二年内实现的农业发展纲要。
    二
    下面我首先说一下农业发展纲要在过去四年中执行的情况。
    全国农业发展纲要要求：从一九五六年开始，在十二年内，粮食每亩平均年产量，在三种不同的地区，分别达到四百斤、五百斤和八百斤。这是四十条纲要的中心。一九五九年，达到和超过纲要这个规定的，已经有五百零四个县（包括相当于县的旗、市和大市辖的区，下同），占全国一千七百八十六个县的百分之二十八；已经有二亿八千六百七十七万亩粮食耕地，占全国现有十二亿亩粮食耕地的百分之二十四。
    全国农业发展纲要要求：棉花的亩产量在十二年内，按照不同的情况，分别达到四十斤、六十斤、八十斤和一百斤皮棉。一九五九年，亩产皮棉达到一百斤以上的有四十五个县、七百六十一万三千亩棉田；八十斤到九十九斤的有五十五个县、一千零四十四万八千亩棉田；六十斤到七十九斤的有一百零四个县、一千八百四十二万三千亩棉田；至于六十斤以下的，许多地方都没有以四十斤为界分别统计。因为绝大多数棉田的亩产量都超过四十斤，四十斤以下的主要是新发展的棉田。总计亩产皮棉六十斤、八十斤或者一百斤以上的，共有二百零四个县，占全国一千零二十七个植棉县的百分之二十；共有三千六百四十八万四千亩棉田，占棉田实收面积八千五百多万亩的百分之四十二。
    除了粮、棉以外，油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂等各种农作物，几年来也都有不同程度的增长。一九五九年全年养猪二亿七千万头，年底存栏一亿八千万头；全国一亿二千万农户，按年底存栏数平均每户一头半，按全年饲养量平均每户两头以上，提前达到了纲要要求在一九六二年达到的标准。去年十月以来，全国各地又普遍展开了一个群众性的养猪运动，并且以养猪为首，掀起了一个全面发展畜牧业的高潮。据今年三月初的统计，全国有一千七百多万头怀孕的大家畜，这就是今年牛、马、驴、骡等家畜大发展的基础。一九五八年和一九五九年两年造林五亿四千万亩。山区生产的内容，已经超过了农、林、牧相结合的范围，有些地方利用山谷水库在山区发展了渔业生产，还有些地方兴办了小型的土法生产的或者土洋结合的林产化学工业和其他工业，开展了“万宝山”运动。人民公社的副业生产也比过去合作社时代发展得快，一些久已停止生产的土特产品和手工产品已经恢复起来。全国农村人民公社在去年冬季的“小秋收”运动和短途运输运动中，取得了几十亿元的收入。海洋和淡水的渔业生产，一九五九年的产量达到五百零二万吨，比一九五七年的三百一十二万吨增加了一百九十万吨。人民公社兴办的农村工业，一九五九年的产值达到一百亿元左右。社办工业是农村实现人民公社化以后新兴的经济部门，是全国农业发展纲要原来没有规划的。
    由于人民公社多种经营的大发展，一九五九年的农业产值达到七百八十三亿元（社办工业的产值一百亿元不包括在内），既增加了公社的公共积累，也增加了社员的个人收入。除了税收、公积金、公益金和各项生产费用以外，按全国农村人口平均，一九五九年每人收入八十五元左右，赶上了农业合作化以前富裕中农的平均收入水平（每人八十元），提前达到了纲要要求在一九六二年前后达到的目标。这是全国平均的水平，有许多富庶的地区已经超过八十五元这个水平，也还有相当一部分地区低于这个水平。
    在农业增产措施方面，毛泽东同志在一九五八年的大跃进中，应用先进农业科学原理，总结农民群众生产实践的丰富经验，提出了土、肥、水、种、密、保、管、工的“农业八字宪法”。“农业八字宪法”比全国农业发展纲要规定的各项增产措施，内容更为丰富，更为完整。两年来，各地人民公社普遍实行了“农业八字宪法”。从一九五七年冬季开始，几千万人上阵，大修水利，两年共增加灌溉面积五亿五千万亩，加上原有的灌溉面积，共达十亿零七千万亩。其中有六亿一千万亩，抗旱能力已经分别达到纲要规定的三十天，五十天和七十天的标准。在肥料方面，我们这几年来发展了养猪，扩大了绿肥面积，公社举办了许多土化肥厂，有的公社还办了年产八百吨合成氨（合三千吨硫酸铵）的小洋化肥厂，国家投资兴办了一些现代化的化肥厂，使有机肥料和无机肥料有了很大的增加。在改良土壤方面，全国低洼易涝地和各种低产田有七亿多亩，初步改良了四亿五千万亩，占百分之六十。水土流失比较严重的面积有一百五十万平方公里，初步进行了保持水土措施的有六十万平方公里，占百分之四十。两年以来还普遍开展了群众性的土壤普查运动，各地正在把普查所得的资料加以科学分析，研究因地改良、因地种植、因地施肥等项措施，逐步地按社按队编制土地利用规划，按地块建立土地档案。这是一种很有价值的，既是群众性的，又是科学性的农田基本建设。各种农作物的良种推广面积，一九五九年达到十八亿亩，占总播种面积的百分之八十，棉、麦、稻、薯等主要农作物的良种已经基本普及。各地人民公社已经建立起五千四百多万亩种子基地。合理密植已经广泛推行，过密过稀的毛病越来越少，合理密植的规律也为越来越多的人所掌握。全国农业发展纲要要求分别在七年或者十二年内，基本上消灭的植物病害和虫害有十一种，其中的棉花蚜虫和红蜘蛛，在集中的产棉区已经基本做到不卷叶，不红叶，达到消灭危害的要求；对于蝗虫和粘虫，也做到基本控制，不使为害；其他如麦类黑穗病、水稻螟虫等等的危害损失率一般已降低到百分之二以下。许多地方还创造了几万亩、几十万亩耕地连片的无病虫害区。纲要要求分别在七年或者十二年内，基本上消灭的危害牲畜最严重的病疫有八种，其中的牛瘟已经基本消灭，猪瘟、鸡瘟、牛肺疫等的发病率也已经显著降低。农业生产的工具改革运动，几年来也有很大的成绩，创造了水稻插秧机等多种多样的新农具，到一九五九年底共推广了各种改良农具和半机械化农具五亿二千多万件，对农业劳动生产率的提高起了不小的作用。在田间管理和精耕细作方面，也有新的发展。各地人民公社都在大搞丰产方，大搞园田化。农民们说：埂直如线，地平如镜，深耕，密植，种子好，合理施肥，合理灌溉，精耕细作，灭草，灭虫，灭病，把大田种得像菜园子一样。从群众中来的农业八字宪法，又回到群众中去，成了农业生产的经典。此外，纲要提出的多种高产作物，提高复种指数，扩大耕地面积和办好国营农场，四年以来也都取得了不小的成就。纲要要求在十二年内建成的为农业服务的气象台站网、水文观测站网和地方道路网，也已经粗具规模，许多地方已经提前实现。
    纲要关于在农村中发展科学、教育、文化、卫生事业的要求，几年来执行的结果，成绩也很大。到一九五九年已经有一亿一千多万青、壮年摆脱了文盲地位，占农村青、壮年总人数的三分之二。社办小学，队也办小学，农村小学教育已经基本普及。各地人民公社还办了三万多所农业中学，在校学生二百九十六万人，平均每个公社有农业中学一点二所、学生约一百二十人，这是进一步在农村中普及中学教育的基础和开端。人民公社还办了各种业余学校和红专学校。农业科学试验研究，已经成为农民的群众性的活动。社办的农业科学试验研究组织，据十二个省的不完全统计，有七千六百九十个，从业人员有三万八千多人。以人民公社为基础的全国性的农业科学试验研究网已经基本形成。许多农业劳模，本来是不识字或者识字不多的，现在却成了中国农业科学院或者省分院（所）的研究员，成为农学会的会员，或者被聘到大学去讲学。农村广播网和电话网、邮政网，除了少数边远地方以外，已经基本普及。
    除四害、讲卫生的运动，成绩之大是有目共睹，有口皆碑的，山西省稷山县和广东省佛山市就是基本上除掉了四害的县、市的典型。麻雀已经打得差不多了，粮食逐年增产了，麻雀对于粮食生产的危害已经大大减轻；同时，林木果树的面积大大发展了，麻雀是林木果树害虫的“天敌”，因此，以后不要再打麻雀了，纲要所说的除四害中，应当把麻雀改为臭虫。纲要要求在十二年内基本消灭和积极防治的疾病，有的已经基本消灭和防治住了（例如天花、鼠疫等），血吸虫病的患者已经治疗了百分之七十，其他一些病的发病率也大大下降。
    纲要关于保护妇女儿童、实行五保等要求，由于人民公社实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，大办了公共食堂、托儿所、产妇院和敬老院等等，实际做的已经超过纲要的要求。
    总之，全国农业发展纲要四年来实际执行的结果是：纲要的某些内容已经被实际生活所超过，有些要求已经基本实现，大部实现，或者在部分地区实现了，这是伟大的胜利。这些胜利，主要是近两年来在总路线、大跃进和人民公社这三面红旗之下获得的。有了这些胜利，就奠定了我们提前实现农业发展纲要的基础。
    另一方面，我们也必须看到，提前实现全国农业发展纲要，并不是一件轻而易举的事。首先是粮食每亩平均年产量还有百分之七十以上的县没有达到纲要要求的水平。全国粮食总产量，在过去四年中共增加了一千九百零五亿斤，即从一九五五年的三千四百九十六亿斤，增加到了一九五九年的五千四百零一亿斤。但是按照纲要要求的水平计算，全国粮食总产量应该有七千二百亿斤到七千五百亿斤，还要在一九五九年粮食总产量的基础上，再增加一千八百亿斤以上，即增长三分之一以上。这还要尽很大的努力。达到了七千二百亿斤，每人平均一千斤或者稍多一点，同过去相比，当然是一个很大的跃进；但是不能因此就认为粮食问题已经解决，还应当进一步为争取每人平均至少一千五百斤粮食而奋斗。棉花的产量要达到纲要的要求，同样还需要作很大的努力，而且也同样要在达到纲要要求以后，再作进一步的努力。
    在增产措施方面，我们也还有许多工作要做。例如水利灌溉，修好了水库，并不等于按工程计算的灌溉面积都已经收到实际效益，还必须蓄上水，修好渠道，平整好土地，准备好提水工具，才能实际发挥效益。有的工程，特别是大型工程，在当年并不能发挥效益，或者不能充分发挥效益，往往要到第二年甚至第三年才能充分发挥效益。我们要继续努力，争取提前实现纲要所提出的能够充分发挥效益的灌溉面积在十二年内达到九亿亩的要求。但是实现了纲要的要求，也还只能像纲要所说的“避免普通的水灾和旱灾”，因此，我们还必须进一步努力。做了水土保持的工程措施和生物措施，也不等于完全控制了水土流失，种的树和草要成活了，根系铺开了，树冠长起来了，才能收到保持水土和涵养水源的实效。植树造林到实现绿化也还有个很长的过程，很多地方种的树现在还很少，种上了的也还要成活，抚育好，长起了树冠，才能真正实现绿化。
    纲要提出的基本消灭和积极防治的植物病虫害，基本上消灭危害牲畜最严重的病疫，基本上消灭和积极防治危害人民最严重的疾病，基本上消灭老鼠、臭虫、苍蝇、蚊子等方面的要求，都需要进行长期的、经常的、反复的努力。因为这些东西并不是一次扑灭，永不再生，而是除了又生，生了又要除的。
    纲要要求，国家、集体和个人分别储备起足够一年到两年食用的粮食。在粮食产量没有很大的提高以前，固然可以储备一部分，但是要储备这样多则不是短期内所能实现的。修缮和新建住宅，改善社员的居住条件，这是一定要办的事，但是，在最近几年，公社的资金还是应该主要用于生产性的基本建设，新建社员住宅只能逐步进行。在这些方面，我们都还要作比较长期的努力，来实现纲要提出的要求。
    由此可见，实现农业发展纲要，还是全体农民和全国人民要继续完成的重大任务，而要提前实现，就必须再经过几年的艰苦努力，再苦战几年。而且，实现了全国农业发展纲要，也不等于农业就完全“过关”了。我们要走的路还是长的，必须本着不断革命的精神，在总路线、大跃进和人民公社这三面红旗的引导下，鼓足干劲，努力奋斗，完成一个任务，就提出一个新的任务，不断地奋勇前进。
    三
    人民公社制度是我们提前实现农业发展纲要的根本保障。我们要贯彻执行中共中央关于人民公社的历次决议，使人民公社不断地健全发展，应当大力发展生产队的经济，特别要加强对穷队的领导和帮助，使它们逐步赶上富队，同时，在坚持三级所有制的前提下，积极发展社有经济。我们的前途是从队基本所有过渡到社基本所有，然后再从社基本所有过渡到全民所有。但是，要实现这个前途，必须具备必要的条件。就实现社基本所有制的条件来说，第一，全社的经济发展达到了每人年平均收入一百五十元至二百元的水平；第二，社有经济部分在全社经济中占了优势；第三，穷队赶上了富队；第四，农村的机械化和半机械化达到了一定程度。为了创造这些条件，我们就必须坚持三级所有制，坚持以按劳分配为主的分配制度，坚持等价交换等制度。坚持这些制度，不仅有利于当前人民公社的生产和建设，也有利于将来的逐步过渡；不仅符合于人民群众当前利益的要求，也符合于人民群众长远利益的要求。
    我们要充分利用人民公社统一安排生产的优越性，更好地全面发展农、林、牧、副、渔的多种经营。每个公社应当根据本社的条件，适应农业发展纲要所提出的要求，在农业方面，以粮为纲，适当安排粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂等各类农作物的生产布局。在畜牧业方面，应当把现在已经形成的养猪运动，继续发展下去，并且以养猪为首，发展养牛、养羊、养马、养驴、养骡、养鸡、养鸭、养鹅、养兔、养蜂。在林、副、渔业等方面，也同样应当分门别类做出适当安排。很好地安排各个方面的生产布局，就可以使整个农业生产有计划地按比例地得到普遍发展，发展速度也就能够更快。
    由于农村人民公社化的实现，积极推行农业的技术改造，已经成为全党全民的重要任务。我们一方面要在先进农业科学和生产实践经验相结合的基础上，使“农业八字宪法”的内容一天天地更加丰富起来，使农业耕作方法方面的技术革新和技术革命，不断地向前发展。另一方面又必须加速进行农业生产工具方面的技术革新和技术革命，力求提早实现我国农业机械化。毛泽东同志在一九五九年五月即已指出，在农村人民公社化实现以后，“农业的根本出路在于机械化”，“从一九五九年算起，四年小解决，七年中解决，十年大解决”，这个进度比原来农业发展纲要所设想的要快得多。我国实现农业的机械化，是有步骤的，从改良农具、半机械化到机械化。农业机械化又是多方面的，农、林、牧、副、渔五业都要逐步实行半机械化和机械化。农业方面的耕作、排灌、防治病虫害、田间运输和农产品初步加工等也都要逐步实行半机械化和机械化。各地条件不同，应当先在那些方面实行机械化，应当采用什么样的机械机器，都必须因地、因时、因事制宜。由于我国是一个人口多、耕地少的国家，我国的农业又有精耕细作的优良传统，因此，农业机械化还必须与“农业八字宪法”的各项措施相结合，与精  耕细作的优良传统相结合，从而使实行农业机械化的结果不仅能够提高农业的劳动生产率，而且能够提高单位面积产量。机械化和园田化相结合，就是我国农业技术现代化的标志。
    为了促进整个农业技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，为了争取农业生产的继续跃进，在大型现代工业要生产更多的农业生产资料的同时，必须继续大大发展社办工业。人民公社不仅应当办各种农产品加工工业，而且应当按照本地的资源条件，分别举办采煤、发电、冶炼、化工等企业，生产土铁、土钢，制造改良农具和半机械化农具，制造土化肥、土农药。人民公社还应当根据需要和可能，发展公路和土铁路的建设。发展社办工业和交通运输业，就能够更好地执行工农业并举的方针，能够更快地发展农业生产和建设，更快地改变农村的经济和文化面貌。
    要提前实现农业发展纲要，必须广泛动员一切方面的力量。毛泽东同志指出，我国国民经济的发展，要以农业为基础，以工业为主导，使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业相结合。加快农业的发展，这是高速度地、按比例地发展我国国民经济的一个重要关键；我们的农业发展了，不仅轻工业更好办，而且重工业也更好办。同时，对于农业的加速发展，特别是对于农业机械化的实现，又必须有工业和其他部门的支援。提前实现农业发展纲要，不仅是几亿农民的事情，不仅是农业部门的事情，而且是各个经济部门、各个文化教育部门的事情。工业、交通、财政、贸易、金融、科学、教育、文化、卫生等各个部门，都应当根据农业发展纲要对本部门的要求和农业生产建设进一步发展的需要，制定规划，以便更好地支援农业的生产和建设。并且应当切实检查执行的情况，随时解决发生的问题。
    人民公社制度的巩固和发展，农业生产和建设的发展，农村中科学、教育、文化、卫生事业的发展，各部门对农业的支援，都是必须发动亿万人民群众的力量，才能做好的事情。因此，在这些工作中，必须贯彻执行党的群众路线。各级领导干部要切实改进领导作风，贯彻执行勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的方针，反对贪污，反对浪费，反对官僚主义、命令主义作风，要完全做到以平等态度待人，坚持干部参加劳动的制度，和群众完全打成一片，善于发挥和依靠群众的积极性和创造性；要经常作调查研究，了解情况，分析问题，不断提高自己的政治水平、经济理论水平和对实际工作的分析、理解水平。公社的干部要善于抓生产，也要善于抓生活，应当在发展生产的同时，密切关心群众的生活，注意劳逸结合。公共食堂问题是现在抓生活的一个中心问题。到一九五九年底，全国农村已经办起三百九十万个食堂，在食堂吃饭的人数有四亿人，占农村人民公社总人数的百分之七十三。所以，办好公共食堂是有关最广大群众的切身利益的一件大事情。目前多数食堂是办得比较好的，群众是满意的，但是，有的地方食堂办得还不够多，有一部分食堂办得还不好，要在自愿参加的原则下，继续大办食堂，办好食堂。公社各级的领导干部，要亲自加强对食堂工作的领导，不只是把这个工作交给次要的干部去管。食堂的管理要民主，账目要按期公布。所有的食堂都要养猪种菜，要做到计划用粮，节约用粮，保证吃饱吃好。人民公社的其他福利事业，也应当积极办好。有的地区正准备在公共食堂、托儿所等集体福利组织的基础上，大办综合性的生活服务站，这是一个值得研究推广的新经验。办好这些福利事业，把社员的生活安排好，就更能够促进生产的发展。
    现在全国的形势很好，在一九五八年和一九五九年连续大跃进的基础上，不但一九六○年能够继续跃进，而且在整个六十年代也能够争取持续跃进。以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在全国城乡各个部门普遍发展，必将一浪接一浪地不断高涨。在六亿五千万人民中，社会主义的积极性空前提高。我们完全有信心在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，依靠人民群众的伟大力量和集体智慧，一定能够在比十年更少的时间内在主要工业品产量方面赶上和超过英国，也一定能够在比十二年更短的时间内完成和超额完成农业发展纲要的原定要求，并且在这个基础上继续努力，使我国农村得到更大得多的发展。
    四
   各位代表，全国农业发展纲要草案，反映了我国农村在社会主义的道路上向前发展的过程。这个纲要在这四年来已经深入人心，起了推动我国农村的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的巨大作用。虽然在这四年间，我国农村发生了由农业生产合作社发展为人民公社的深刻变化，以及由此而来的各方面情况的变化，但是由于这个纲要所提出的各项要求还要经过一个时期才能完全实现，所以，它现在仍然起着，而且以后还要继续起动员广大群众的伟大作用。
    因此，中共中央和国务院建议全国人民代表大会按照一九五六年到一九六七年全国农业发展纲要修正草案的原文，除了对“除四害”的一条作个别修改外，不作其他修改，由本次大会予以通过和公布，并且建议大会号召全体农民和全国人民为提前两年或三年实现全国农业发展纲要而努力奋斗。（附图片）
