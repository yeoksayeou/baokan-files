Good political thought leads to high production leaps.
Representative Kang Juying introduces the comprehensive leap forward of the Hengshan Nanyue People's Commune.

We deeply realize that carrying out socialist ideological education is an important guarantee for realizing the leap forward in agricultural production and consolidating and developing people's communes. To have a bumper harvest in thought, we must have a bumper harvest in production. Marxism-Leninism produces grain; this is a truth.

Fellow Representatives:
I fully support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, as well as other reports of the conference.
As Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian pointed out in their reports: "The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are the three magic weapons of our country's entire socialist construction period. They are the products of Mao Zedong Thought," profoundly embodying "how great and correct Mao Zedong Thought—the thought that combines Marxism-Leninism with Chinese practice—is, like a lighthouse guiding us from victory to greater victory." Our Nanyue People's Commune in Hengshan County, Hunan Province, like people's communes across the country, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, has undergone earth-shaking changes in all aspects after two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward. Especially in 1959, we overcame a major drought, rare in nearly a century, in agricultural production and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total grain output of the entire commune increased by 22% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Economic crops, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries also achieved a comprehensive leap forward; industrial production also developed vigorously. Last year, the total output value of the entire commune's agriculture, sideline occupations, and industry reached 4.67 million yuan, an increase of 33% compared to 1958. Last winter and this spring, the entire commune launched a vigorous winter production movement centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation. In just over two months, the entire commune built 106 reservoirs of various sizes, completing 3.9 million cubic meters of earthwork. The projects built in one year are equivalent to more than six times the total number of reservoirs built in the ten years since liberation. It also completed 30,000 mu of afforestation tasks, more than 10,000 mu of land reclamation tasks, transformed 7,800 mu of low-yield fields, and reclaimed more than 20,000 mu of oil-tea forests. The average fertilizer accumulation per mu reached 640 dan. On the basis of the victory in winter production, a high tide of spring plowing and production was immediately launched. At present, all commune members are full of confidence and striving to achieve the goal of producing an average of 1,000 jin of grain and one pig per person in 1960!

1959 was a year of greater leap forward in production and a year of greater harvest in thought. Good political thought leads to high production leaps; a leap forward in production can better improve political thought. This is how our production can continuously leap forward, and people's communes can be consolidated and developed. Judging from the situation in 1959, the broad masses of cadres and people actively support the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. In particular, the poor and lower-middle peasants deeply realize the benefits that the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune have brought them. They compare the General Line to a "guiding light," regard the Great Leap Forward as a "ladder" from poverty to wealth, and see the People's Commune as a "happy nest" without worries. They are as firm as iron in carrying out the Great Leap Forward and consolidating the People's Commune. However, there are also a small number of well-to-do middle peasants who, due to the existence of capitalist ideological tendencies, have an unclear understanding of the Great Leap Forward, the General Line, and the People's Commune. Some even have a kind of resistant emotion, and have expressed many erroneous words and deeds in various aspects. This is a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Over the past year, we have relied closely on the poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out a wide-ranging and in-depth socialist education movement, and have achieved great results.

Last spring, just as the people of the entire commune were jubilantly and confidently carrying out the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, a small number of well-to-do middle peasants began to speak up. They said, "The Great Leap Forward is just bragging and boasting. Even if production increases a little, the costs and labor are high, which is a waste of money and effort, and not worth the loss." Some well-to-do middle peasants also said, "To increase production, there is only one way, which is to assign production quotas to individual households. Otherwise, even if gods come down to earth, it will be in vain." As soon as this kind of thought was exposed, it immediately aroused the resolute opposition of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Under the leadership of the Commune Party Committee, the entire commune used methods such as recollection, comparison, and accounting to criticize the erroneous ideas of a small number of well-to-do middle peasants who denied the Great Leap Forward and attempted to assign production quotas to individual households and take the old road of capitalism, thereby enhancing the ideological understanding of all commune members. Soon, a high tide of spring plowing and production was set off. In just seven days, the entire commune rushed to plow the hard fields, and in more than ten days, the average fertilizer accumulation per mu increased by more than 200 dan. The progress of other production tasks also advanced by leaps and bounds. In the Bali Ping Brigade, the masses were spreading: "Bali Ping, Bali Ping, no one wants to marry (come here)." Last year, when the proposal to continue the leap forward was put forward, this team had 1,300 mu of fields. In the past, due to the lack of water conservancy facilities, it "reaped little or nothing in nine years out of ten." Some well-to-do middle peasants spread pessimistic views, saying: "If Bali Ping can leap forward, I will never eat again in my life." At that time, the person leading production here was the Propaganda Minister of the Commune Party Committee. He convened a forum of five poor peasant households, and everyone studied the need to rush to build the Changchong Reservoir. They did what they said. After mobilizing more than 1,000 laborers from the entire brigade to go all out, plus the support of three nearby brigades, they completed the entire project in three and a half days. Last year, these fields were all planted with double-cropping rice, and they did not suffer losses due to drought. The well-to-do middle peasants were educated by the facts and said very excitedly to the poor peasant commune members: "We people are not good after all. In the past, it was said that three jin of young ginger are not as good as one jin of old ginger. Now it seems that three jin of old ginger are difficult to match one jin of young ginger. No wonder the Communist Party says that things that predecessors dare not even think about can now be done."

Last year, after the early and mid-season rice was transplanted, it did not rain for more than 100 days, and more than 10,000 mu of fields in the entire commune were seriously threatened by drought. At that time, some commune members developed some lax ideas, and a small number of well-to-do middle peasants spread pessimistic complaints, saying that too much double-cropping rice was transplanted, too early, and too densely; that the Great Leap Forward was a beggar's "dream of glory," and in the end, it was all in vain. In order to resolutely overcome the drought and ensure a bumper harvest, the entire commune carried out ideological education on "fighting drought to protect seedlings, and man will conquer nature." Through education, the broad masses of commune members put forward the slogan "If the sky doesn't rain, people will rain, and we will not stop until we seize a bumper harvest," and launched a tenacious battle against the drought. In the Tan Jiaqiao Brigade, 2,100 mu of fields had 1,500 mu with interrupted water sources. Under the firm leadership of the General Party Branch Committee of the brigade, Tan Dongmei, Tan Zuoru, and more than 100 other poor and lower-middle peasants moved their beds next to the waterwheels to sleep, insisting on fighting day and night, resting people but not the wheels, driving more than 600 people in the entire commune, erecting 17 tiers of waterwheels, carrying water over mountains to fight the drought, and more than 370 people carried water to irrigate the seedlings from more than three li away. After a hundred days of fighting, they finally overcame the drought. Not only did the entire commune not lose a single rice seedling due to drought, but it also achieved a great bumper harvest of grain.

In the second half of last year, grain production had a bumper harvest. Just as all commune members were jubilantly celebrating the harvest, the capitalist ideas of a small number of well-to-do middle peasants were concentratedly reflected in the distribution issue. Some people said: Even if grain production increases, except for the state's requisition and unified purchase of grain, the peasants still don't have much hope. In order to raise the ideological understanding of all commune members and criticize capitalist ideas, we systematically carried out a summary education movement after the autumn harvest. This movement was carried out on the basis of summing up the great achievements since the people's commune. Through presenting facts, recalling comparisons, exhibitions, and specific accounting, everyone realized that as long as we have soaring enthusiasm and give full play to the superiority of the people's commune, we can achieve a great leap forward even in years of severe drought. In 1959, the average ration of commune members increased by 40 jin per person compared to 1958; 93% of households in the entire commune increased their income compared to 1958. What is this talk about increasing production without increasing income? Production increased and income greatly increased; life did not decline, but "a dwarf climbing stairs, rising step by step."

Is the distribution system combining the wage system and the supply system good? Does it produce lazy people? Did the well-to-do middle peasants suffer losses by joining the commune? In the entire commune, 30% of the poor and lower-middle peasants used to worry about food and clothing, and could not participate in collective production for about one-third of the year. The implementation of the distribution system combining the wage system and the supply system has provided these people with basic social security and allowed them to concentrate on production. In the Wanfu Brigade, 680 laborers, 70% of them exceeded the stipulated basic workdays last year, and 90% of them were poor and lower-middle peasants. Many people completed more than 6,000 or 7,000 work points throughout the year. More than 95% of the poor and lower-middle peasant households in the entire commune increased their income, 85% of the well-to-do middle peasant households increased their income, 10% of the households had the same income, and only 5% of the households reduced their income slightly because they were not actively involved in work or because their family sideline occupations decreased.

Are public canteens and other welfare undertakings necessary? The peasants replied: "They will not be disbanded even if struck by lightning." Especially women. Since last year, due to the large-scale establishment of various social welfare undertakings, women's labor has been greatly liberated. Before communization, only more than 2,600 of the 9,300 female laborers in the entire commune directly participated in agricultural production, averaging less than 90 workdays per person in 1958. Last year, all women were on the production front, with more than 5,300 people directly involved in agricultural production, averaging 1,700 work points per person. The women said well: "Whoever wants to break up the canteens and nurseries, I will fight them to the death."

Through calculating the big accounts, calculating the small accounts, calculating the collective accounts, and calculating the individual accounts, the commune members said: "The more accounts are calculated, the sweeter the heart becomes," "Calculating makes those who forget their roots turn their heads, and calculating makes capitalism lower its head." Kang Yunwen, a newly emerging middle peasant in the Wanhe Brigade, had no land to stand on and no ashes to sweep before liberation. He worked as a part-time worker outside, and sometimes even ate wild grass. He himself was still wearing a tattered cotton-padded coat left to him by his father when he died. After liberation, he turned over, and his life improved year by year. When the commune was established in 1958, after education and mobilization, he joined the commune, and his income increased greatly. In 1959, his family's income was more than 310 yuan. He took back his wages plus his original savings and added new cotton-padded clothes, new single clothes, woolen clothes, sanitary clothes, and sneakers. The Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune brought him benefits, but he still wanted to say strange things. He said that "the commune is like a tight band, restricting the freedom of the peasants," and he was not active in work. Last winter, in order to educate Kang Yunwen with facts, and also to educate all commune members, the changes in production and life in the entire commune and the entire brigade before and after liberation were compiled into charts and graphs, and Kang Yunwen himself was mobilized to take out all kinds of real objects reflecting the changes in his family's life before and after liberation to hold an exhibition, mobilizing all the commune members in the entire brigade to visit. Through the exhibition, all the visiting commune members said that Kang Yunwen had forgotten his roots. Kang Yunwen repented and shed tears of excitement. Through this widespread and in-depth socialist self-education, not only did it raise the socialist and communist consciousness of the broad masses of commune members, but it also educated and transformed the well-to-do middle peasants. 95% of the well-to-do middle peasants in the entire commune now express their support for the People's Commune. They said that the capitalist road is a "losing gamble," and they should not dream this dream again. "The People's Commune is not only beneficial to three types of people, but we can also be like shrimp resting on the dragon's back, getting water by accompanying the dragon." This shows that as long as production continues to develop, as long as we adhere to the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming them, the vast majority of well-to-do middle peasants do not oppose socialism and are happy to follow the poor and lower-middle peasants on the socialist road under the leadership of the Party.

Over the past year, we have deeply realized that carrying out socialist ideological education is an important guarantee for realizing a greater leap forward in agricultural production and consolidating and developing the People's Commune. To have a bumper harvest in thought, we must have a bumper harvest in agricultural production. This is the truth that Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—produces grain. In the future, we guarantee that on the basis of the achievements we have already made, we will hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Leap Forward, the General Line, and the People's Commune, continue to carry out socialist ideological education, and strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

    政治思想好　生产跃进高
    康菊英代表介绍衡山南岳人民公社全面跃进的情况
    我们深刻地体会到：开展社会主义的思想教育，是实现农业生产跃进和巩固、发展人民公社的重要保证。要有思想上的丰收，才有生产上的丰收。马克思列宁主义出粮食，这是一条真理。各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告，以及大会其他各项报告。
    正如李富春、李先念两位副总理在报告中所指出的：“总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这是我国整个社会主义建设时期的三个法宝，这是毛泽东思想的产物”；深刻地体现着“毛泽东思想——马克思列宁主义同中国实践相结合的思想是多么伟大和正确，它像灯塔一样指引着我们从胜利走向更大的胜利。”我们湖南省衡山县南岳人民公社和全国各地人民公社一样，在党和毛主席的英明正确领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，经过连续两年的大跃进，在各方面起了翻天覆地的变化。特别是1959年，我们在农业生产上，战胜了近百年来少有的大干旱，获得了空前未有的大丰收。全社粮食总产量比大跃进的1958年增产22％，经济作物、林、牧、副、渔等业，也获得全面大跃进；工业生产也蓬勃发展起来了。去年全社农副业和工业总产值达四百六十七万元，比1958年增长33％。去冬今春，全社又开展了轰轰烈烈的以水利积肥为中心的冬季生产运动。仅仅两个多月的时间，全社共兴建了一百零六座大小水库，完成三百九十万土方，一年兴建的工程等于解放十年来兴建水库总数的六倍以上；还完成了三万亩造林任务，一万多亩开荒任务；改造了七千八百亩低产田，垦复了两万多亩油茶林；平均每亩积肥达六百四十担。在冬季生产取得胜利的基础上，紧接着又掀起了春耕大生产的高潮。目前，全体社员正满怀信心地为争取1960年实现平均每人生产千斤粮，一头猪而奋斗！
    1959年，是生产更大跃进的一年，也是思想更大丰收的一年。政治思想好，生产跃进就高；生产一跃进，就能更好提高政治思想。我们的生产能够不断跃进，人民公社能够巩固发展，就是这样取得的。从1959年的情况看，广大干部和群众对党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社积极拥护，特别是贫农和下中农他们深深地体会到总路线、大跃进、人民公社给他们带来的好处，他们把总路线比做“指路明灯”，把大跃进看成由穷变富的“天梯”，把人民公社看成百乐无忧的“幸福窝”。他们对搞大跃进和巩固人民公社，心坚如铁。但是也还有少数的富裕中农，由于存在资本主义的思想倾向，对大跃进、总路线、人民公社认识不清，有的人甚至存在着一种抵触情绪，在各方面发出了很多的错误言行。这是一场社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。一年来，我们紧紧地依靠了贫农和下中农，开展了广泛深入的社会主义教育运动，取得了很大的成绩。
    去年春天，正当全社人民欢欣鼓舞、满怀信心地开展农业生产大跃进的时候，一小部分富裕中农就开始说话了，他们说：“大跃进，还不是吹牛皮，讲大话，就是增了一点产，成本、劳力花得多，也劳民伤财，得不偿失。”还有少数富裕中农说：“要增产是可以，只有一个办法，就是要包产到户。否则，就是神仙下凡，也是枉然。”这种思想一暴露，立即引起了贫农和下中农的坚决反对，全社在公社党委领导下，用回忆、对比、算账等办法，批判了少数富裕中农否认大跃进和企图包产到户，走资本主义老路的错误思想，提高了全体社员的思想认识。很快就掀起了春耕生产的大高潮。全社在短短七天时间中，突击犁完了板田，在十多天的时间中，平均每亩增积了两百多担肥料，其他各项生产进度也突飞猛进。八里坪大队，群众中流传着：“八里坪、八里坪，讨老婆没得人（来）”，去年提出继续跃进时，这个队有一千三百亩田，过去由于缺乏水利设施，“十年九不收”，有的富裕中农就散布悲观论调，说：“要是八里坪能够跃进，我一世都不吃饭了”。当时，在这里领导生产的是公社党委宣传部长，他召开了五户贫农座谈会，大家研究要突击兴修长冲水库，说干就干，经过动员全大队的一千多劳力全力以赴，加上附近三个大队的支援，在三天半的时间，就完成了全部工程。去年这些田全部种上了双季稻，没有因旱受到损失。富裕中农受到了事实的教育，很激动的对贫农社员说：“我们这些人到底不行了，过去说三斤子姜当不得一斤老姜，现在看来，三斤老姜难当一斤子姜了，难怪共产党说，前人不敢想的事情现在能够办到。”
    去年早、中稻插秧以后，一百多天没有下雨，全社有一万多亩田，受到了干旱的严重威胁，当时，部分社员产生了一些松劲思想，少数富裕中农则散布悲观埋怨情绪，说什么双季稻插多了，插早了，插密了；说什么大跃进是叫化子作“荣华梦”，到底还是一场空。为了坚决战胜干旱，保证丰收，全社开展了“抗旱保苗，人定胜天”的思想教育，通过教育，广大社员提出了“天不下雨人下雨，不夺丰收誓不休”的口号，与干旱展开了顽强的战斗。谭家桥大队二千一百亩田，有一千五百亩断绝了水源，在大队党总支委员会的坚决领导下，谭冬梅、谭作如等一百多个贫农、下中农，将被帐搬到水车旁边睡觉，坚持日夜战斗，歇人不歇车，带动了全社六百多人，架起了十七梯水车，车水翻山抗旱，有三百七十多人，从三里多路远的地方，挑水浇苗。经过百天的战斗，终于战胜了干旱，全社不但没有干死一蔸禾，并且获得了粮食的大丰收。
    去年下半年，粮食生产大丰收了，正当全体社员欢欣鼓舞，庆祝丰收的时候，少数富裕中农的资本主义思想，就集中地反映到分配问题上来了。有的人说：粮食增了产，除了国家征粮统购，农民还是没有多大希望。为了提高全体社员的思想认识，批判资本主义思想，秋收以后，我们系统地进行了一次总结教育运动。这次运动是在总结人民公社化以来的伟大成绩的基础上开展起来的。经过摆事实、回忆对比、展览、具体算账，大家认识到只要有了冲天的干劲，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，就是在大旱年成也能大跃进。1959年社员口粮平均每人比1958年增加了四十斤；全社93％的户比1958年增加了收入。那里是什么增加生产，不能增加收入呢？而是增加了生产，也大大增加了收入；生活不是下降了，而是“矮子上楼梯，步步高升”。
    工资制与供给制相结合的分配制度好不好呢？是不是出懒汉呢？富裕中农参加公社是不是吃了亏呢？全社30％的贫农、下中农，过去愁吃愁穿，每年约有三分之一的时间不能参加集体生产，实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度后，使这些人的基本生活得到了社会保险，一心一意搞生产。万福大队六百八十个劳力，去年有70％的人，超过了规定完成的基本劳动日，其中有90％的是贫农、下中农，有不少的人全年完成了六、七千工分以上。全社贫农、下中农95％以上的户增加了收入，富裕中农有85％的户增加了收入，10％的户平收，仅仅只有5％的户，由于自己出工不积极，或者家庭副业减少了，因而减少了一点收入。
    公共食堂和其他福利事业要不要呢？农民回答是：“雷打也不散”。特别是妇女。全社去年以来，由于大量举办了各种社会福利事业，大大解放了妇女劳力，全社九千三百个妇女劳力，公社化前仅仅只有二千六百多人直接参加过农业生产，1958年平均每人做的工不到九十个，去年全体妇女都在生产战线上，有五千三百多人直接投入了农业生产，平均每人做了一千七百工分。妇女们说得好：“哪个要拆散食堂、托儿所，我就要和他拼命”。
    全社通过算大账，算细账，算集体账，算个人账，社员说：“账越算，心越甜”，“算的翻身忘本回了头，算的资本主义低了头。”湾河大队新上中农康运文，解放前敲壁无土，扫地无灰，自己在外面做零工，有时还吃野草，他本人还是穿他父亲死时留给他的一件烂棉衣，解放后翻了身，生活一年一年的好起来了。1958年建立公社的时候，经过教育动员，参加了公社，收入大大增加，1959年全家收入三百一十多元，领回去的工资加上原来储蓄，添制了新棉衣、新单衣、绒线衣、卫生衣、球鞋。大跃进、人民公社给他们带来好处，可是，他偏偏还要讲怪话。说什么“公社好像紧箍咒，卡得农民不自由”，出工不积极。去年冬天，为了用事实教育康运文，同时也教育全体社员，将全公社和全大队解放前后的生产、生活变化情况，编画成图表，并动员康运文自己将全家解放前后的生活变化的各种实物拿出来，开了一个展览会，动员了全大队的社员都来参观。通过展览，所有参观的社员，都说是康运文翻身忘本。康运文痛改前非，激动的流出眼泪。通过这一次广泛深入的社会主义自我教育，不仅提高了广大社员的社会主义共产主义觉悟，也教育改造了富裕中农，全社的富裕中农现在已有95％的人表示拥护人民公社。他们说，资本主义道路是个“倒票子”，再不要去作这个梦了。“人民公社不但是对三部分人有好处，我们也可以虾子歇在龙背上，伴龙得水。”这说明，只要生产不断发展，只要我们对于他们坚持了团结教育改造的方针，富裕中农中的绝大部分是不反对社会主义的，是乐意在党的领导下跟着贫农、下中农一道走社会主义道路的。
    一年来，我们深刻地体会到，开展社会主义的思想教育，是实现农业生产更大跃进和巩固、发展人民公社的重要保证。要有思想上的丰收，才有农业生产上的丰收。这就是马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想出粮食的真理。今后，我们保证在已经取得成绩的基础上，高举毛泽东思想、大跃进、总路线、人民公社的红旗，继续进行社会主义的思想教育，力争实现更大更好更全面的跃进。
