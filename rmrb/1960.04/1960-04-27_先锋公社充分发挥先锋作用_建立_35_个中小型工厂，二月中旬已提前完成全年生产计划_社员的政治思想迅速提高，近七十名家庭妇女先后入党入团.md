Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 26th:  The Pioneer People's Commune, established in a residential area of Changsha's West District that previously only consumed and did not produce, has undergone tremendous changes. In 1957, there were only two small factories with seventy workers. Now, there are thirty-five small and medium-sized factories and over two hundred production teams, employing more than six thousand people. The total production value in the first month and a half of this year reached 9.93 million yuan. With the participation of a large number of housewives in production, various collective welfare programs have also been extensively launched. A spirit of love for labor and mutual assistance has become the norm among residents.

The Pioneer People's Commune was established in September 1958. Since its establishment, the commune has tightly grasped the central link of developing production. Based on the spirit of serving large-scale industry, agricultural production, and the people's livelihood, the Commune Party Committee first rectified the factories run by street residents before the establishment of the commune. It successively merged over one hundred factories into thirty-five fixed factories and hundreds of production teams into two hundred and forty-two, increasing the number of production personnel to six thousand one hundred and nineteen. After the rectification, due to the commune's superior ability to better organize production, the production of commune-run factories surged wave after wave. The total output value of commune-run industry was over 2.6 million yuan in 1958, which increased to 6.78 million yuan in 1959. In 1960, the original plan was to reach a total annual output value of 9.8 million yuan, but by February 14th, the annual plan was overfulfilled, with a total output value reaching 9.93 million yuan. The variety of products has also increased from 108 in 1958 to the current 301. In the early stage of the commune, it could only produce simple products such as shoe buckle eyes and sacks, but now it can produce motor parts, complete sets of textile machinery castings and parts, as well as steel wire ropes, cupolas, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, boilers, and over ninety other relatively complex products. Recently, they have also produced new products such as tungsten steel molds and precision ceramic files. With the development of production, these factories, established from scratch, have grown from small to large and from low to high, and already possess a considerable amount of production equipment. At the beginning of 1959, the whole commune did not have a single machine, but now it has over six hundred units of mechanical equipment such as lathes, planers, electric motors, power generation equipment, refining equipment, sawing machines, twelve-ton punches, and presses, greatly improving production capacity. These commune-run industries have also greatly improved the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization through technical innovation and technical revolution movements and are developing towards semi-automation and automation.

In the year since its establishment, commune-run factories have launched extensive cooperation with large-scale industry, agriculture, commerce, and other departments, doing everything possible to serve these departments, and have become an important force in supporting large-scale industrial production, agricultural production, and daily-use industrial product production. For example, the commune-run metal processing factory has long undertaken part or all of the sand casting tasks for large factories such as the Hunan Shipbuilding Factory and the Textile Machinery Factory, and produces boilers, motor housings, and other products for large factories. This factory, together with the commune-run machinery factory, also processes water pipes for the Changsha Water Company, reaching over 700 tons from July of last year to April of this year, and produces steel wire ropes for mines, with a maximum monthly output of 20 tons. Commune-run factories also produce hydrochloric acid for large factories in Guangzhou and Wuhan and produce screws and spikes for large factories and railway departments in Zhuzhou. In terms of supporting agricultural production, in the last winter and this spring alone, the commune-run fertilizer factory produced over 570 tons of fertilizer and granular fertilizer, and the machinery factory produced over 16,000 pieces of small farm tools and parts for rice transplanters and threshers for rural people's communes in Changsha County. Recently, it also rushed to produce 600 sets of rice transplanter parts to supply to the countryside. In addition, these factories make full use of the leftover materials and scraps from large factories and the waste products collected in the city to produce over one hundred kinds of daily necessities such as small leather shoes, cloth shoes, paper, and woodenware.

With the development of production, over eight thousand street residents of the Pioneer Commune have participated in various production and service jobs, of which housewives account for more than 80%. In order to enable them to get rid of household chores and participate in production with peace of mind, the commune comprehensively organized the people's economic life on the basis of collective welfare programs such as canteens, kindergartens, and nurseries originally run by street residents. The whole commune, based on the principle of "running well actively and participating voluntarily," has established thirty-seven collective canteens for street residents and seventy-seven nurseries and other childcare organizations. The commune has also established thirteen service stations, homes for the elderly, and four social welfare homes in various streets. These collective living and welfare organizations, under the leadership of the Commune Party Committee and with the cooperation of finance and trade, administration, and other departments, are constantly being consolidated and improved. The thirteen service stations are doing everything possible to serve production and residents, with over one hundred service items, taking care of all the residents' affairs, big and small, such as clothing, food, housing, transportation, marriage, and funerals. The large-scale establishment of collective welfare programs has enabled women who participate in work to have no worries and has strongly supported production. For example, in Tongtai Street, after comprehensively organizing the people's economic life, the attendance rate of workers has reached over 98%.

Since the establishment of the commune, people's mental outlook has also undergone great changes. A new atmosphere of love for labor, unity and mutual assistance, and love for the collective has emerged among street residents. In particular, after more than eight thousand housewives participated in production, their political ideology, cultural level, and technical skills have improved by leaps and bounds. Thirty housewives have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China, and thirty-eight have joined the Communist Youth League. In the past year, the 2,243 advanced individuals commended by the whole commune were mostly housewives. Many female workers have also launched large-scale labor competitions. In February of this year, female workers in eighteen factories put forward 256 innovation proposals. Over 1,580 people in the whole commune have also participated in studies at the commune-run Red and Expert School, eliminating illiteracy for 686 people.

With the development of production, residents' income has increased, and their living standards have continuously improved. In 1959, the total amount of wages paid by the commune reached 890,000 yuan. According to a survey in Tongtai Street, the average income per person per month increased from 8.9 yuan in 1958 to 12.55 yuan, an increase of 41%. The average monthly wage of street industrial workers is around 30 yuan.

    先锋公社充分发挥先锋作用
    建立35个中小型工厂，二月中旬已提前完成全年生产计划
    社员的政治思想迅速提高，近七十名家庭妇女先后入党入团
    据新华社长沙26日电　一个只消费不生产的居民区——长沙市西区，建立了以街道居民为主的先锋人民公社后，面貌有了巨大改变。1957年这里只有两个有七十名工人的小型工厂，现在这里出现了三十五个中小型工厂和二百多个生产小组，生产人员有六千多人，今年头一个半月的生产总值达到九百九十三万元。随着大批家庭妇女参加生产，各种集体福利事业也大量举办起来。居民中热爱劳动、团结互助已经形成风气。
    先锋人民公社，于1958年9月成立。公社成立以后，就紧紧地抓住了发展生产这一中心环节。公社党委根据为大工业服务、为农业生产服务、为人民生活服务的精神，首先对公社成立前街道居民举办的工厂进行了整顿，先后将一百多个工厂合并成三十五个定型的工厂，将数百个生产小组合并成二百四十二个，生产人员增加到六千一百一十九人。整顿后，由于公社发挥了能更好地组织生产的优越性，社办工厂的生产一浪高过一浪。1958年社办工业生产总产值二百六十多万元，1959年就提高到六百七十八万元，1960年原计划全年总产值达九百八十万元，到2月14日止，就超额完成全年计划，总产值达到九百九十三万元。产品品种也由1958年的一百零八种，增加到目前的三百零一种。办社初期只能生产鞋扣眼、麻袋等简单产品，现在已能生产马达部件、纺织机械成套铸件和零件，以及钢丝绳、冲天炉、盐酸、硫酸、锅炉等九十多种比较复杂的产品。最近他们又生产了钨钢模、精密陶锉等新产品。随着生产的发展，这些白手起家办起来的工厂，也由小到大、由低到高，已经拥有相当多的生产设备。1959年初全社一部机器也没有，现在已拥有车床、刨床、电动机、发电设备、炼油设备、锯床、十二吨冲床和压机等机械设备六百多台，生产能力大大提高。这些社办工业还通过开展技术革新和技术革命运动，大大提高了机械化、半机械化的程度，并且正在向半自动化、自动化发展。
    建社一年多来，社办工厂和大工业、农业、商业等部门展开了广泛的协作，千方百计为这些部门服务，已经成为支援大工业生产、农业生产、日用工业品生产的一支重要力量。如社办金属加工厂就长期承担着为湖南船舶厂、纺织机械厂等大工厂的部分或全部翻砂铸件任务，并为大工厂生产锅炉、马达壳等产品。这个厂还和社办机械厂一起，为长沙市自来水公司加工自来水管，从去年7月到今年4月达七百余吨，为矿山生产钢丝绳，最高月产达二十吨。社办工厂还为广州、武汉的大工厂生产盐酸，给株洲的大工厂和铁路部门生产螺丝和道钉。在支援农业生产方面，仅去冬今春两季度，社办化肥厂就生产了化肥、颗粒肥五百七十多吨，机械厂为长沙县农村人民公社生产了小农具和插秧机、打稻机等零件一万六千多件，最近又赶制了六百台插秧机零件供应农村。此外，这些工厂充分利用大厂边料、角料和城市收集的废品，生产出小皮鞋、布鞋、纸张、木器等日用品一百多种。
    随着生产的发展，先锋公社有八千多名街道居民参加了各种生产和服务工作，其中家庭妇女占80％以上。为了使她们能够摆脱家务牵累，安心参加生产，公社在街道居民原来举办的食堂、幼儿园、托儿所等集体福利事业的基础上，全面组织了人民的经济生活。全社根据“积极办好，自愿参加”的方针，为街道居民举办了三十七个集体食堂，举办的幼儿园、托儿所等托儿组织七十七处。公社还在各个街道举办了十三个服务站、敬老院和社会福利院四所。这些集体生活、福利组织，在公社党委的领导和财贸、行政等部门的配合下，正在不断巩固和提高。十三个服务站更是千方百计为生产、为居民服务，服务项目有一百多种，把居民的衣、食、住、行和婚、丧等大小事务全部包了下来。由于大办集体福利事业，使参加工作的妇女无后顾之忧，有力地支援了生产。如通泰街在全面组织人民经济生活以后，工人的出勤率达到98％以上。
    公社建立以后，人们的精神面貌也有了很大变化。在街道居民中出现了热爱劳动、团结互助、热爱集体的新风尚。特别是八千多名家庭妇女参加生产以后，政治思想和文化、技术水平等有了飞跃的提高。有三十名家庭妇女光荣地加入了中国共产党，三十八人加入了共青团。一年来全公社评选出的二千二百四十三人次先进人物，绝大部分也是家庭妇女。不少女工还大搞劳动竞赛，今年2月份，十八个工厂的女工就提出了二百五十六项革新建议。全社还有一千五百八十多人参加了公社举办的红专学校学习，扫除了六百八十六名文盲。
    随着生产的发展，居民的收入增加，生活水平不断提高。1959年一年公社发放的工资总额达八十九万元，据通泰街调查，每人每月平均收入由1958年的八·九元上升到十二·五五元，增加了41％，街道工业工人平均工资每月在三十元左右。
