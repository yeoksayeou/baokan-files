Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd, dispatch from Paris, TASS, April 2nd: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev gave a broadcast speech on French television on April 2nd, after concluding his visit to France.

Khrushchev said that he was satisfied with the negotiations and talks held with French President de Gaulle. He said that naturally, several such meetings and talks, even lengthy, candid meetings and talks, could not unravel the many complex knots that had accumulated in the world and Europe during the "Cold War" and periods of international tension. However, this does not mean that we must sit idly by and wait for these knots to untie themselves. Only when national leaders take into account the interests of their peoples, approach each other, and strive to reach mutual understanding, is it possible to continue to promote the normalization of international relations.

He said that the meetings between the two sides showed that there were many points of agreement in the assessment of important international issues and the methods for solving them. We reached a common conclusion: it is necessary to further ease international tensions. Both sides acknowledged that disputes in international relations should only be resolved peacefully, without threats or the use of force.

He then described the enormous achievements made by the Soviet Union in economic construction and improving people's living standards over the past forty years since the founding of the country. The Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers said that the secret to our achievements is very simple. It lies in the essence of our people's socialist state established after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

Khrushchev then spoke about the magnificent prospects planned for the development of the Soviet economy in the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. He refuted an argument often heard in the West, that the Soviet Union's striving for peace and easing international tensions is only because it needs a respite to accumulate its strength and then use force to compel other countries to accept its system.

He said that the Soviet Union is a country of working people, and working people are incompatible with the practice of getting rich and increasing their wealth by means of war, plundering other countries' territories, and resources. The Soviet government, representing the will of the Soviet people, steadfastly strives for a peaceful solution to the extremely important international issues that concern all of mankind: universal and complete disarmament, the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, guaranteeing European security, and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

Khrushchev concluded by saying that in the near future, extremely important negotiations will be held in Paris. The heads of state of France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States will participate in these negotiations. During the negotiations, the most important and pressing issues of our time will be discussed and resolved. We hope that the summit talks will help untie many knots and remove the stones that have accumulated on the road as a result of years of the "Cold War." We hope that the French people and the French government will make their own contribution to the smooth progress of the upcoming negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd, dispatch from Rambouillet, TASS, April 2nd: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev held a press conference on April 2nd. More than eight hundred journalists from newspapers, television stations, and radio stations around the world attended the press conference.

Khrushchev said that whether before or after his visit to France, he looked forward to the summit meeting with optimism.

When talking about the West Berlin issue, Khrushchev said that declaring West Berlin a free city is a way to solve the Berlin problem. He said that the Soviet Union does not object to the possibility of guarantees and is willing to participate at any level in implementing the guarantees that may be formulated by the United Nations.

When a reporter asked about the Geneva disarmament negotiations, Khrushchev replied that the governments of all countries, especially the governments of major powers, should deeply recognize the urgent necessity of reaching a universal disarmament agreement.

Khrushchev said that pressure from the people of all countries on their governments could also help solve this problem.

A reporter from the French newspaper "Le Monde" asked Khrushchev to comment on the news of France's second atomic test. Khrushchev replied that the Soviet government had already expressed its attitude towards France's explosion of its first atomic bomb, and still adheres to that attitude. We express our great regret about the conduct of this explosion. Khrushchev hoped that an agreement could be reached on the prohibition of nuclear explosions, and that France would also participate in this agreement.

Khrushchev expressed his belief that if France and the Soviet Union work together, it would be beneficial to consolidating the friendly relations between the two countries and to safeguarding peace in Europe and the world.

    赫鲁晓夫在巴黎发表电视演说
    必须进一步缓和国际紧张局势
    在记者招待会上指出达成普遍裁军协议的迫切性
    据新华社3日讯　据塔斯社巴黎2日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫结束了在法国的访问后于4月2日在法国电视台发表广播演说。
    赫鲁晓夫说，他对同法国总统戴高乐举行的谈判和会谈感到满意。他说，自然，几次这样的会见和会谈，即使是为期很长的开诚布公的会晤和会谈，也无法把在“冷战”期间，在国际紧张局势期间，在世界和欧洲积累起来的那许多错综复杂的问题的结解开。但这不是说，必须袖手坐待这些结自行解开。只有国家领导人考虑到各国人民的利益，互相接近，努力达成互相谅解，才可能继续推动国际关系正常化。
    他说，双方的会见表明，在对重要的国际问题的估计上和解决这些问题的方法上，彼此有不少相同之点。我们达到了共同的结论：必须进一步缓和国际紧张局势。双方承认，国际关系中的争执问题只应该通过和平途径在没有威胁和不使用武力的情况下加以解决。
    他接着叙述了苏联建国四十多年来在经济建设和提高人民生活水平方面所取得的巨大的成就。苏联部长会议主席说我们取得成就的秘密是很简单的。它就在于伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利后建立起来的我们人民的社会主义国家的本质。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到苏联发展国民经济的七年计划为苏联经济发展所规划的宏伟远景。他驳斥了在西方常常可以听到的一种议论，即苏联争取和平和缓和国际紧张局势只是因为它需要一个间息，来积聚自己的力量，然后再用武力来迫使他国接受自己的制度。
    他说，苏联是个劳动人民的国家，而劳动人民与靠战争、靠掠夺别国领土和原料资源来发财致富和增加自己财富的作法是格格不入的。苏联政府代表苏联人民的意志，坚持不懈地力求和平解决现在全人类所关注的极重要的国际问题：普遍彻底裁军、停止核武器试验、保证欧洲安全、缔结对德和约。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，不久的将来，将在巴黎举行极其重要的谈判。参加这次谈判的将有法、苏、英、美四国国家领导人。在谈判期间将讨论和解决当代极其重要的和迫切的问题。我们希望最高级会谈有助于解开许多结，把由于多年“冷战”的结果而积累起来的石块从道路上搬开。我们希望法国人民和法国政府对于即将举行的谈判的顺利进行作出自己的贡献。
    据新华社3日讯　据塔斯社郎布依埃2日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫2日举行了记者招待会。世界各报纸、电视台和广播电台的八百多名记者参加了招待会。
    赫鲁晓夫说，无论是在访问法国以前，还是在访问法国以后，他都乐观地展望着最高级会议。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到西柏林问题时说，宣布西柏林为自由城市是解决柏林问题的方法，他说，苏联不反对保证的可能性，并且愿意在任何一级参加实施可能由联合国制定的保证。
    在记者问到日内瓦裁军谈判的问题时，赫鲁晓夫回答说，所有国家的政府，特别是各大国政府应该深刻认识到达成普遍裁军协议的迫切必要。
    赫鲁晓夫说，各国人民对政府施加压力，也可以帮助解决这个问题。
    法国“世界报”记者请赫鲁晓夫谈谈对法国进行第二次原子试验的消息的看法。赫鲁晓夫回答说，苏联政府已对法国爆炸第一个原子弹表示过态度，现在仍然坚持那种态度。我们对进行这种爆炸表示十分遗憾。赫鲁晓夫希望能够就禁止核爆炸达成协议，而且法国也将参加这个协议。
    赫鲁晓夫表示相信，如果法国和苏联共同努力，这对巩固苏法两国之间的友好关系，对保障欧洲和世界和平是有益处的。
