    At the Factory Where Ma Xueli Is Located
    Qun Sheng
    Currently, a fervent campaign to learn from Ma Xueli is underway among workers throughout Hubei Province, and many have rapidly improved during this movement. The impact of this movement is even greater and more profound at the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, where Ma Xueli works. Here, "Everyone learns from Ma Xueli, everyone catches up with Ma Xueli" has become a prevailing trend; here, "Do as Ma Xueli does" has become the common language and action of the people.
    Ma Xueli's thought and style have become something shared by many workers. Everyone values the collective, and the market for individualism and departmentalism has greatly shrunk. People describe the current situation as: one person innovates, everyone cares; one person has difficulties, everyone supports; superiors care for subordinates, subordinates support superiors; Party members help the masses, and the masses cherish Party members. There are countless examples of this. In the past, it was common for the preceding process to ignore the subsequent process; now, the preceding process always actively prepares good production conditions for the subsequent process. For example, the Fourth Workshop, in order to frequently create favorable conditions for the First and Second Processing Workshops, which are the next process, has specifically established a system of organizing cadres, workers, and technicians to visit, interview, and solicit opinions from the First and Second Processing Workshops every half month; it has also sent a technician to be stationed in the two workshops to understand the situation in a timely manner, and then help solve the problems or notify the workshop to study and solve them. Similarly, the First and Second Processing Workshops also actively reflect the situation to the Fourth Workshop, which is the preceding process, and actively cooperate with the Fourth Workshop. The viewpoint of departments and offices serving the workshops and serving production has also been greatly strengthened. For example, the Tool Room often takes the initiative to send tools to the lathes and into the hands of the workers. Similarly, the Technology Section often sends technicians to the workshops to help workers tackle key problems; medical personnel often bring medicine to the workshops and provide round-the-clock treatment. Cooks also often deliver hot dishes and hot meals to the workshops. Leading cadres of Party organizations at all levels also often go to the workshops to work alongside the workers, fighting day and night. In the past, many people were afraid of large tasks and liked to talk about difficulties; now, when the Party issues a call, everyone consciously responds, full of ambition, and afraid of no difficulties. The popular saying is: "The bigger the task, the more glorious; the bigger the difficulty, the more energetic." People not only go wherever the Party points, like Ma Xueli, but also, like Ma Xueli, use the method of vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution to overcome difficulties in production and work. As a result, a large number of proposals for technological innovation have emerged, and many problems in production that were previously considered difficult to solve have been resolved. The most outstanding classes and groups have broken their production records hundreds of times in the past three months; the deeds of "one person doing the work of two" and "one person doing the work of three" are increasingly common in various workshops and sections. For example, in the Tool Workshop, workers who produce at a rate of "one person doing the work of three" account for more than 30% of the total number of workers in the workshop. Most of the originally backward units and individuals have changed their original appearance. Hundreds of Ma Xueli-style red banner figures have newly emerged throughout the factory, and there are also dozens of Ma Xueli-style red banner groups.
    With the great changes in the ideological outlook of the broad masses of workers and the flourishing of technological innovation, the factory's production situation is also getting better and better, and is thriving. In November and December of last year—the first two months of the comprehensive campaign to learn from Ma Xueli—the factory completed more production than the total amount completed in the first half of the year, thus enabling the factory to comprehensively overfulfill the state plan. Since the beginning of the year, all the workers in the factory have again won an opening red and a full red in the first two months, achieving a sustained leap forward. Currently, all the workers in the factory are vigorously carrying out a mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, fighting to complete the production plan for the first quarter ahead of schedule and to prepare for production in the second quarter.
    How is Ma Xueli himself doing? He has not disappointed the expectations of the Party and the people and, under the leadership of the factory Party committee, is closely united with the masses and moving forward even more courageously. Since the beginning of the year alone, he himself, as well as the innovation proposals he has made together with other workers, number more than eighty, and more than twenty have already been implemented. The "multi-tool, multi-position screw milling tool" successfully created by him and miller Han Baoxin and others can cut with three milling cutters at the same time, causing iron filings to roll like a waterfall, increasing production efficiency by 69.9 times; the toothless saw successfully trial-produced together with workers Wang Dexin, Zhang Hejun, and technician Qian Wenhao, when used to saw metal blanks, increases efficiency by fifteen times compared to sawing with a milling machine.

    在马学礼所在的工厂
    群声
    现在，湖北全省职工正在热烈开展学习马学礼运动，很多人在运动中飞快地得到了提高。而在马学礼所在的武汉重型机床厂，这个运动所产生的影响就更加巨大而深刻。在这里，“人人学马学礼，人人赶马学礼”，已经成为一种普遍的风尚；在这里，“照马学礼那样干”，已经成为人们共同的语言和行动。
    马学礼的思想和风格已经成为许多职工共有的东西。大家都以集体为重，个人主义、本位主义的市场大大地缩小了。人们形容今天的情况是：一人革新，人人关心；一人困难，大家支援；上级关心下级，下级拥戴上级；党员帮助群众，群众爱护党员。这方面的事例是极多的。过去，上道工序不管下道工序，是比较常见的事；现在，上道工序总是积极主动地为下道工序准备良好的生产条件。像第四车间，为了经常为下一工序的第一、二加工车间创造良好的条件，特地建立了每半月组织干部、工人技术人员到第一、二加工车间参观、访问和征求意见的制度；还派了一技术人员常驻两车间，以便及时了解情况，然后帮助解决或通知本车间研究解决。同样，第一、二加工车间，也主动地向上道工序的四车间反映情况，主动地和四车间配合协作。科、室面向车间，为车间生产服务的观点也大大加强。像工具室，就经常主动地把工具送到车床、送到工人手里。同样，技术科常派技术人员下车间，帮助工人攻关键；医务人员常带药下车间，通宵地巡回治疗。炊事员也常把热菜、热饭送到车间去。各级党组织的领导干部，也经常到车间跟班劳动，和工人一道日夜奋战。过去，许多人怕任务大，好讲困难；现在，党发出什么号召，大家就自觉地响应，一个个雄心勃勃，什么困难也不怕，流行的说法是：“任务越大越光荣，困难越大越有劲。”人们不仅像马学礼那样，党指向哪里，就奔向那里，而且也像马学礼一样，用大搞技术革新、技术革命的办法，来克服生产和工作中的困难。于是，技术革新创议大量地出现了，生产中许多过去认为难解决的问题得到了解决。成绩最突出的班、组，三个多月来已经上百次地刷新了班、组生产纪录；“一人顶两人”、“一人顶三人”的事迹，各车间、工段都在日益增多。像工具车间，生产“一人顶三人”的工人就占全车间工人总数的30％以上。一些原来比较落后的单位和个人，大都改变了原来的面貌。全厂新成长起来的马学礼式的红旗人物数以百计，马学礼式的红旗小组也有几十个。
    随着广大职工思想面貌的大改变，技术革新万紫千红，全厂生产情况也越来越好，蒸蒸日上。去年11月和12月——全面开展学习马学礼运动的头两个月，这个工厂完成的产量比上半年完成产量的总和还多，因而使全厂全面超额地完成了国家计划。开年以来，全厂职工在头两个月又夺得了开门红、满堂红，实现了持续大跃进。现在，全厂职工正轰轰烈烈地开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，为提前完成一季度的生产计划，并为第二季度作好生产准备而战。
    马学礼自己怎样了呢？他没有辜负党和人民的期望，正在工厂党委的领导下，紧密地和群众团结在一起，更加勇往直前地迈进着。单是开年以来，他自己以及他和其他工人一道提出的革新创议就有八十多项，已经实现的有二十多项。他和铣工韩宝信等集体创造成功的“多刀多位螺丝铣具”，能使三把铣刀同时切削，使铁屑像瀑布般翻卷，提高生产效率达六十九点九倍；和工人王德鈊、张鹤钧及技术员钱文浩共同试制成功的无齿锯，用来锯割金属毛坯，比用铣床锯割，提高效率十五倍。
