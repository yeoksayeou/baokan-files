    A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire
    By People's Daily Commentator

    On the night of April 11th, over 20,000 people in Masan, South Korea, "rose up in rebellion," launching a heroic struggle against the fascist rule of the Syngman Rhee group. Angry masses, raising their arms and shouting the slogan "Syngman Rhee regime, step down!", like an unstoppable tidal wave, surrounded the Masan police station, the Masan city headquarters of Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party, as well as the residences of the Masan mayor, police chief, and Liberal Party members of parliament, and destroyed these buildings with stones. After the Syngman Rhee group dispatched large numbers of police to suppress the uprising, the masses continued to fight bravely. As of the 13th, the struggle of the people of Masan continues.

    The uprising of the people of Masan is not an isolated event. It is the eruption of long-accumulated anger among the people of South Korea under the enslavement by American imperialism and the fascist rule of the Syngman Rhee group. For more than a decade, under the criminal rule of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee group, South Korea has long become a living hell: the national economy is on its last breath, and all industries are withering; due to American grain dumping and the Syngman Rhee group's exorbitant taxes and levies, the former "granary of Korea" has now become a "land of hunger"; imprisonment and killings, reign of terror – the number of innocent people arrested, imprisoned, and killed last year alone reached 247,000. Even members of the opposition Democratic Party in the Syngman Rhee group said that this fascist dictatorship "sends shivers down the spine" and that "violence and terror run rampant in broad daylight."

    The suffering of the South Korean people is caused by the aggressive policies of the United States. Everyone knows that without the strong support of American imperialism, the rule of the Syngman Rhee group could not last even a day. Since May 1948, Syngman Rhee has been "president" for four consecutive terms, all with the support of American bayonets. In order to persist in dividing Korea and completely turning South Korea into its colony and advanced atomic war base, American imperialism has continuously violated the Korean Armistice Agreement in recent years, repeatedly and illegally transporting modern weapons, including various missiles, into South Korea to carry out atomic war preparations. At the same time, in order to strengthen its war deployment in the Far East, the United States is currently stepping up the formation of a Northeast Asian military group, including South Korea. Precisely because of this, although the United States expressed "regret" over the most shameful "presidential" election staged by the Syngman Rhee group on March 15 this year, it still fully supports this fascist dictatorship in order to use it to imprison the South Korean people. In fact, the tyranny of the Syngman Rhee group is imposed on the South Korean people by American imperialism.

    American imperialism supports and encourages the Syngman Rhee group to maintain its reactionary rule in South Korea with the most brutal means. However, the facts are contrary to the wishes of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee group: the more they try to use violence to maintain their tottering rule, the more unstable the Syngman Rhee group's position becomes, and the closer it gets to collapse. Since the demonstration of thousands of people in Masan caused by the "election" farce on March 15, people's demonstrations have continued one after another in Daegu, Daejeon, Seoul, Busan, and other places in the past month. Syngman Rhee's "throne" has become a volcano about to erupt. The heroic struggle of the people of Masan shows that the Syngman Rhee group, supported by American imperialism, will sooner or later be reduced to ashes in the eruption of the volcano.

    The struggle of the people of Masan will not be isolated. More than 15,000 people from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a mass rally on April 12 to support the uprising of the people of Masan. Our people, who have always been concerned about the peaceful reunification of Korea, express deep sympathy for the suffering situation of the South Korean people and support the heroic actions of the Masan people's uprising. We believe that as long as the South Korean people strengthen their unity and fight, they will be able to get rid of fascist terror rule and force American troops to get out of South Korea as soon as possible.

    星火必然燎原	本报评论员
    南朝鲜马山市两万多人民于4月11日夜间“揭竿而起”，掀起了反对李承晚集团法西斯统治的英勇斗争。愤怒的群众，振臂高呼“李承晚政权滚下台来！”的口号，像不可遏止的滚滚海潮，包围了马山市警察署、李承晚的自由党的市党部以及马山市长、警察署长和自由党议员们的住宅，用石头捣毁了这些建筑物。而在李承晚集团出动大批警察镇压后，群众依然奋勇搏斗。到13日止，马山人民的斗争仍在继续中。
    马山市人民的起义并不是一件偶然事件。这是在美帝国主义奴役和李承晚集团法西斯统治下南朝鲜人民久已蕴积的怒火的爆发。十几年来，在美帝国主义和李承晚集团的罪恶统治下，南朝鲜早已成为一座人间地狱：民族经济奄奄一息，百业雕蔽；由于美国的粮食倾销和李承晚集团的横征暴敛，往日的“朝鲜谷仓”如今已变成“饥饿之乡”；监禁杀戮，恐怖统治——光是去年被逮捕、囚禁和杀害的无辜人民，就达二十四万七千人。甚至连李承晚集团的反对党民主党议员，都说这种法西斯独裁统治“使人不寒而栗”，“暴力和恐怖横行于光天化日之下。”
    南朝鲜人民的苦难，是美国的侵略政策所造成的。谁都知道，没有美帝国主义大力支持，李承晚集团的统治连一天也维持不了。自从1948年5月以来，李承晚一连四任“总统”，都是在美国的刺刀支持下上台的。美帝国主义为了坚持分裂朝鲜和把南朝鲜彻底变成它的殖民地和原子战争前哨基地，近年来不断破坏朝鲜停战协定，屡次非法地把包括各种导弹在内的现代化武器运进南朝鲜，进行原子备战活动。与此同时，美国为了加强远东地区的备战部署，目前正加紧拼凑包括南朝鲜在内的东北亚军事集团。正是因为这样，尽管美国对于今年3月15日李承晚集团导演的一出最丑恶的“总统”选举表示“遗憾”，但是仍然全力支持这一法西斯独裁政权，以便利用它来禁锢南朝鲜人民。事实上，李承晚集团的暴政，是美帝国主义强加于南朝鲜人民头上的。
    美帝国主义支持和鼓励李承晚集团用最残暴的办法维持南朝鲜的反动统治。但是，事实正同美帝国主义和李承晚集团的愿望相反：他们愈是想用暴力来维持摇摇欲坠的统治，李承晚集团的地位愈不稳定，愈接近于崩溃。从3月15日由于“选举”丑剧而引起的马山市数千人示威以来，在最近一个月的时间里，在大丘、大田、汉城、釜山等地，人民示威游行接连不断。李承晚的“宝座”，已经变成了一触即发的火山口。马山人民的英勇斗争表明，美帝国主义支持下的李承晚集团，迟早会在火山的爆发中化为灰烬。
    马山人民的斗争并不会是孤立的。平壤市各界一万五千多人在4月12日举行了群众大会，支持马山市人民的起义。一向关怀朝鲜和平统一的我国人民，对于南朝鲜人民的痛苦处境表示深切同情，对于马山市人民起义的英勇行为表示支持。我们相信，只要南朝鲜人民加强团结进行斗争，就能够早日摆脱法西斯恐怖统治，就能迫使美国军队滚出南朝鲜。
