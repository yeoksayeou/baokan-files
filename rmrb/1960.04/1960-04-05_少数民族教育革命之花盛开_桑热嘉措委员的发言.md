Comrades,

I fully agree with the work report of Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong, and I support the reports made to the conference by Vice-Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. I will implement them in my future work. Now, I will report only on my observations of the Qinghai Nationalities Normal School. Any inaccuracies, please criticize and correct.

With the development of industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production in our province, education has also achieved unprecedented development. Especially since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for building socialism, we have resolutely implemented the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. A vigorous leap forward situation has emerged on the cultural and educational front. Significant achievements have also been made in minority education.

Qinghai Nationalities Normal School developed from the pastoral area teacher training class of 1951. The number of students has increased from 51 to 665, a twelve-fold increase. The number of teachers has also increased from the original two to 52, a twenty-five-fold increase. Not only has there been a large increase in quantity, but also a great improvement in political thought. Party and Youth League organizations have grown from small to large, with Party members increasing from two to twenty-one, and Youth League members from one to one hundred and seventy-three. The school has also sent 429 outstanding teachers to the country. They work actively and diligently in their positions, and many have won the titles of advanced workers and pacesetters. This year, 24 teachers attended the Qinghai Provincial Conference of Advanced Workers on the Propaganda and Education Front.

The school's Party committee has strengthened the teaching work and the political and ideological education of teachers and students, closely combining it with social movements to carry out political and ideological education. For example, in 1958, during the socialist revolution movement in the pastoral areas of our province, the school widely organized teachers and students to speak out freely and debate. Through debate, right and wrong were distinguished, the line between the enemy and ourselves was drawn, and class consciousness was raised. As a result of the improvement of the political thought of teachers and students, the leap forward in teaching work has been powerfully promoted, and a new trend of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping has emerged in thought, study, and labor. The quality of teaching has improved significantly. For example, among the 615 students who took the exam in 1958, 542 passed the overall assessment, accounting for 88% of the total number of examinees, and 73 failed, accounting for 12%. In 1959, among the 555 students who took the exam, 545 passed the overall assessment, accounting for 98.2% of the total number of students, and only ten failed, accounting for 1.8%. Under the leadership of the Party, teachers have displayed the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and with soaring revolutionary zeal, they have compiled a batch of teaching materials themselves: six volumes of arithmetic textbooks, six volumes of Chinese-Tibetan bilingual language textbooks, two volumes of political textbooks, and one volume each of Chinese literacy textbooks, music, Tibetan grammar, pedagogy, and physical education. At the same time, in conjunction with teaching work, scientific research work has also been vigorously carried out, and air lamps, mineral radios, paper, medicines, etc. have been produced.

Under the guidance of the educational policy of combining education with labor, work-study programs have also yielded fruitful results. In addition to participating in 15,000 voluntary labor days outside the school, such as repairing railways and helping communes, the 20 acres of campus land reclaimed last year yielded more than 200,000 catties of vegetables, achieving half self-sufficiency in vegetables. In addition, brick and tile, lime, carpentry, papermaking, gypsum, and pig farms, and a barber shop have been built. The school has built a hall for 1,200 people, burned 150,000 bricks, 30 tons of lime, and 600,000 adobe bricks, and refined two tons of iron. There are more than 60 kinds of industrial products, with a total output value of 12,458 yuan. Through labor practice, not only has social wealth been created and production knowledge enriched, but also the relationship with the masses has been strengthened, the mass viewpoint and labor viewpoint have been established, and the glory of labor and the greatness of collective strength have been experienced, thus correcting the erroneous views of belittling labor and belittling the working people. Labor is glorious, and love of labor has become a new trend among teachers and students. At the same time, it has also strengthened the physical fitness of teachers and students, and the incidence of disease has been greatly reduced. The school's Party committee attaches great importance to the work of cultivating and improving new teachers, establishing spare-time schools, and organizing teachers to study systematically, constantly improving their political and professional level. It also put forward the slogan: Teach what you learn, and make up for what you lack. The majority of teachers and students attach great importance to learning Chinese. Most teachers and students can read simple Chinese newspapers, and many can write articles in Chinese. At present, a vigorous and solid campaign to increase production and practice economy, centered on improving teaching quality, is underway at the Nationalities Normal School.

A drop of water can reflect the sun. From the inspection of the Qinghai Nationalities Normal School, we can see the general situation of the development and changes in culture and education in the whole province. Minority education is blossoming like spring flowers. This is the result of the hard work and diligence of all teachers and students under the direct leadership of the school's Party committee, and it is a great victory for the Party's education policy. From the inspection, I deeply realized that:

First, we must closely rely on the leadership of the Party and listen to the Party's words. Experience has proved that the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all undertakings. The growth and expansion of the Qinghai Nationalities Normal School and the achievements it has made are all the result of strengthening the Party's leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, and correctly implementing the Party's education policy and a complete set of walking on two legs. Wherever the Party points, we will go there. Teachers and students of all ethnic groups unite, help each other, and work together to create an unprecedentedly vigorous situation.

Second, we must conscientiously study and implement the Party's education policy. The Party's education policy is the concrete application and new development of the principles of Marxist-Leninist education combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution. The brilliant achievements in teaching, work-study programs, etc. are the result of correctly implementing the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. Experience has proved that the more deeply the Party's education policy is implemented, the greater the achievements will be. Therefore, only by resolutely implementing the Party's education policy can we move from victory to greater victory.

Third, implementing the mass line and launching mass movements is the fundamental line of education work. Because our education is the education of the working people, educators must have the determination and high enthusiasm to serve the people. As long as we firmly believe in the infinite creative wisdom of the masses, follow the mass line, and launch mass movements, any difficulties will be solved easily.

Fourth, only by studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works diligently and constantly improving our political and professional level can we successfully complete the tasks assigned by the Party. At present, our country's socialist construction is developing rapidly. Under this excellent situation, in order to catch up with the development of the situation, we must actively study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, give play to subjective initiative, and muster greater revolutionary zeal to cultivate more socialist construction talents with socialist consciousness, certain scientific and cultural knowledge, production knowledge, and sound physique for the motherland.

1960 is a year of continued leap forward, which puts forward more arduous and glorious tasks for education work. To this end, under the absolute leadership of the Party, we must hold high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, have great ambitions, set high goals, and muster greater revolutionary zeal to strive for the sustained leap forward in 1960.

Finally, I wish the conference a complete success and all the comrades good health!

    少数民族教育革命之花盛开
    桑热嘉措委员的发言各位委员：
    我完全同意陈叔通副主席作的政协工作报告，拥护李富春、李先念两位副总理向大会所作的报告，并在今后工作中贯彻执行。现在，我仅就青海民族师范学校视察情况作一汇报，不妥之处，请批评指正。
    随着我省工农牧业生产的发展，教育事业也得到了空前未有的大发展，特别是从1958年大跃进以来，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，坚决贯彻执行了党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与劳动生产相结合的方针，文教战线上出现了生气勃勃的跃进形势。少数民族教育也取得了显著成绩。
    青海省民族师范学校是在1951年牧区师资训练班的基础上发展起来的。学生由五十一人发展到六百六十五人，增加了十二倍。教师也由原来的二人发展到五十二人，增加了二十五倍。不仅在数量上有很大的增长，而且在政治思想上也有很大提高，党团组织由小到大，党员由二名发展到二十一名，团员由一人发展到一百七十三名。并为国家输送了四百二十九名优秀教师，他们在自己的岗位上工作积极、肯干，不少人获得了先进工作者和标兵的称号。今年就有二十四名教师出席了青海省宣教先进工作群英会。
    学校党委加强了对教学工作和师生的政治思想教育工作，密切结合社会运动，进行政治思想教育。如1958年我省牧业区社会主义革命运动，就广泛组织全校师生鸣放、辩论。经过辩论分清了是非，划清了敌我界限，提高了阶级觉悟。由于师生政治思想的提高，有力的推动了教学工作的跃进，出现了思想、学习、劳动的学、比、赶、帮的新风尚。教学质量显著提高，如1958年参加考试的六百一十五名学生中，总评及格的五百四十二人，占参加考试总数的88％，不及格的有七十三人，占12％；而1959年参加考试的五百五十五人，总评及格的有五百四十五人，占学生总数的98.2％，不及格的仅有十人，占1.8％。教师在党的领导下发挥了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，以冲天的革命干劲，自编了一批教材：算术课本六册，汉藏文对照语文六册，政治课本二册，汉文识字课本、音乐、藏文文法、教育学、体育各一册。与此同时，结合教学工作还大力开展了科学研究工作，制成了空气电灯、矿石收音机、纸、药品等。
    在教育与劳动相结合的教育方针指导下，勤工俭学也结出了丰硕之果。师生除参加校外修铁路、帮助公社等一万五千个义务劳动日外，去年开垦的二十亩校园收了二十多万斤蔬菜，实现了蔬菜半自给。并建起了砖瓦、石灰、木工、造纸、石膏、养猪场，理发馆，自建了容一千二百人的礼堂，烧砖十五万块，石灰三十吨，土坯六十万块，炼铁二吨。工业产品就有六十多种，总产值达一万二千四百五十八元。通过劳动实践，不仅创造了社会财富，丰富了生产知识，并密切了与群众的关系，树立了群众观点和劳动观点，从而体会到劳动光荣、集体力量的伟大，纠正了轻视劳动、轻视劳动人民的错误观点。劳动光荣、热爱劳动，在广大师生中，已形成为新的风尚。同时还增强了师生的体质，患病率大大下降。学校党委非常重视培养、提高新教师的工作，建立了业余学校，组织教师有计划的进修，不断提高他们的政治、业务水平。并提出：教什么学什么，缺什么补什么的口号。广大师生非常重视学习汉文、汉语。大部分师生都能阅读简单的汉文报纸，还有不少人能用汉文写文章。目前，一个既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实，以提高教学质量为中心的增产节约运动，正在民族师范学校展开。
    一滴水可以照见太阳，从青海省民族师范学校的视察情况可看出，全省文化教育发展、变化的概况，少数民族教育，正像春天的鲜花盛开。这是全体师生在学校党委的直接领导下，鼓足干劲，辛勤劳动，辛勤工作的结果，是党的教育方针、政策的伟大胜利。从视察中深深体会到：
    一、紧紧地依靠党的领导，听党的话。经验证明，党的领导是一切事业取得胜利的根本保证。青海民族师范学校的成长、壮大和取得的成就，都是加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，正确地贯彻执行了党的教育方针和一整套两条腿走路的结果。党指向那里就奔向那里，各族师生团结一致，互相帮助，共同努力，出现了前所未有的生气勃勃的局面。
    二、认真学习和贯彻党的教育方针。党的教育方针是马克思列宁主义教育原理结合中国革命实践具体运用和新的发展，教学、勤工俭学等方面取得的辉煌成就，是由于正确贯彻执行了党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与劳动生产相结合的方针的结果。经验证明，党的教育方针贯彻的越深入成绩就越大。因此，只有坚决贯彻党的教育方针，才能从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    三、贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动，是教育工作的根本路线。因为我们的教育，是劳动人民的教育，教育工作者就必须具有为人民服务的决心和高度的热情。只要坚决相信群众的无穷无尽创造智慧，走群众路线，大搞群众运动，任何困难都会迎刃而解。
    四、只有刻苦学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作，不断提高政治业务水平，才能胜利的完成党所交给的任务。当前，我们国家的社会主义建设正在一日千里的向前发展，在这大好的形势下，为了赶上形势的发展需要，就要积极学习马列主义和毛主席著作，发挥主观能动作用，鼓足更大的革命干劲，为祖国培养出更多具有社会主义觉悟、掌握一定的科学文化知识、有生产知识和体魄健全的社会主义建设人材而努力奋斗。
    1960年是继续跃进的一年，这就给教育工作提出了更加艰巨而又光荣的任务。为此，必须在党的绝对领导下，更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，怀雄心，立大志，鼓足更大的革命干劲，为实现1960年持续跃进而努力。
    最后，祝大会胜利成功，各位委员身体健康！
