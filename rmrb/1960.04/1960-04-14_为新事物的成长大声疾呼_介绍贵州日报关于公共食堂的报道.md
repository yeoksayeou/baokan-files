    Vociferously Advocate for the Growth of New Things
    — Introducing Guizhou Daily's Reports on Public Canteens
    Rural public canteens have not only become the main economic life venues for the broad masses of people, but have also developed into important places for mass cultural activities and political activities. They have become schools for conducting collectivist and communist education among the masses. We should pay great attention to the growth of such a new thing and give it prominent publicity.
    Guizhou Daily has done a relatively good job in reporting on rural public canteens. Since the birth of rural public canteens in the summer of 1958, Guizhou Daily has given prominent coverage. Especially from the second half of last year to the first quarter of this year, with the consolidation and development of rural public canteens, Guizhou Daily's canteen reports have also reached a new peak. In the first quarter of this year, Guizhou Daily conducted a more systematic and comprehensive publicity on canteens, actively promoting the growth of public canteens in the people's communes.
    Grasping typical examples, planting red flags, establishing pacesetters, and vigorously publicizing new things are characteristics of Guizhou Daily's canteen reports. They constantly grasp typical examples in the basic links of running canteens well, highlight them on the page, and vociferously promote them. At the same time, they are supplemented by special pages and special columns to deeply and thoroughly publicize the same issue from various aspects. In order to strengthen the ideological nature of canteen reports and publicize the great significance of running canteens well, the instructions of the local Party committees were also published several times while making typical reports, which played a significant role in promoting canteen work. After grasping typical examples and establishing pacesetters, they also reported on the movement of learning from, catching up with, and surpassing the "pacesetter canteens" in various places, expanding the influence and guiding the work of consolidating canteens in depth. The report on the Yizhong Management Area of Lezhi Commune in Nayong County, where the canteens were run best, is an example. All twenty-eight canteens in this management area had red flags planted. Guizhou Daily reported this on the front page headline, and this report touched on some basic issues of running canteens well in a relatively comprehensive and systematic way. In conjunction with this news, the editorial "Run Canteens Well, Greet the High Tide of Spring Planting" was published, affirming the experience of Yizhong Management Area in running canteens, calling on the whole province to learn from it, and expounding the important significance of running canteens well for winning the victory of spring planting. Subsequently, the news of 20,000 canteens in the Bijie area catching up with the canteens of Yizhong Management Area was reported. Prominent reports were also made on the Yongyin Canteen of Xincheng Commune in Duyun City, Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. Yongyin Canteen has done a great job in strengthening leadership, implementing democratic management, raising pigs, growing vegetables, and establishing a family fortune. Guizhou Daily published the news and the instructions of the Qiannan Prefecture Party Committee on the front page on January 19; later, it used a whole page to report on the upsurge of catching up with the Yongyin Canteen in the whole prefecture. Regarding the democratic management of canteens, on March 6, a special page reported on the Dazhai Canteen of the Huaxi Commune in Guiyang City as an example for the whole province, published a commentary, and called on the whole province to grasp democratic management like the Dazhai Canteen. In order to better promote the management experience of this canteen in the whole province, on March 22, Guizhou Daily published the full text of the Provisional Management Measures of the Dazhai Canteen as a reference for canteens in various places. Regarding the issue of strengthening leadership and implementing the class line, Guizhou Daily highlighted this on March 12 when comprehensively introducing the experience of Muyang Commune in Suiyang County in running canteens well. At the same time, it published the instructions of the Zunyi Prefectural Party Committee and the special article "To Care About Production, First Care About People" by the Secretary-General of the Prefectural Party Committee, emphasizing the need to strengthen the Party's specific leadership over canteens and conscientiously implement the class line. Technological innovation in canteens is of great significance for running canteens well. Guizhou Daily has successively reported on the widespread mass-based innovation movement of cooking utensils in various prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and some counties and communes, introduced some new cooking utensils that can be widely promoted, and also published the editorial "Vigorously Reform Cooking Utensils." After establishing pacesetters in various aspects, on March 18, Guizhou Daily concentrated the pacesetter canteens that had already been reported on a whole page, using popular and easy-to-understand forms with poetry and paintings, and introduced the different characteristics of each canteen separately. This approach not only vigorously commended the pacesetter canteens and deepened people's impression of the pacesetter canteens, but also comprehensively introduced the basic experience of running canteens well, which was equivalent to making a general review of the pacesetter canteens in the whole province. During this period, Guizhou Daily organized a total of seven special canteen pages and published thirteen front-page headlines.
    Going into key points, conducting investigations and research, and publishing substantial investigation reports is also a method to deepen canteen reports. The "Ten Goods of Canteens" published by Guizhou Daily on February 10 is an example. "Ten Goods of Canteens" is an investigation report on four canteens in two counties. This kind of investigative article with facts and analysis fully and forcefully illustrates the superiority of canteens, enabling people to systematically understand the superiority of public canteens and the great significance of running canteens well, which plays a significant role in improving people's understanding of canteens.
    Grasping typical examples and key points cannot ignore the general. In coordination with typical reports, Guizhou Daily also paid attention to using flexible and diverse forms such as small lenses, small columns, small communications, small articles, and picture columns to expand the reporting area and coverage, extensively reflecting the situation of leaders at all levels going deep into leading canteens, introducing a wide variety of new cooking utensils, reporting on the new customs and new atmospheres that have emerged after running canteens well, and commending hard-working canteen managers and cooks. The combination of key points and generalities makes the canteen reports both dazzling and supportive; makes the canteen reports not only reflect the rich and colorful reality, but also effectively guide the work.

    为新事物的成长大声疾呼
    ——介绍贵州日报关于公共食堂的报道
    农村公共食堂不但已经成为广大人民群众主要的经济生活场所，而且已发展成为群众文化活动、政治活动的重要场所，它已经成了向群众进行集体主义、共产主义教育的学校。对于这样一个新生事物的成长，应当给予极大的注意，作突出的宣传。
    贵州日报对于农村公共食堂的报道，是做得比较好的。从1958年夏天农村公共食堂诞生的日子起，贵州日报就作了突出的报道。特别是从去年下半年到今年第一季度，随着农村公共食堂的巩固和发展，贵州日报的食堂报道，也出现了一个新的高峰。今年第一季度，贵州日报就对食堂作了比较系统、全面的宣传，积极地促进了人民公社公共食堂的成长。
    抓住典型，插红旗，树标兵，对新生事物大张旗鼓地宣传，是贵州日报在食堂报道上的一个特点。他们不断地抓住办好食堂的几个基本环节上的典型事例，在版面上突出宣传，大声疾呼。同时，辅以专页、专栏，从各方面把同一个问题宣传得深透。为了加强食堂报道的思想性，宣传办好食堂的重大意义，在作典型报道的同时，还几次发表了中共地方党委的批语，这对推动食堂工作有重大作用。在抓住典型，树立标兵以后，他们又报道各地学、赶、超“标兵食堂”的运动，扩大影响，把巩固食堂的工作引向深入。对食堂办得最好的纳雍县乐至公社义中管理区的报道就是一个例子。这个管理区二十八个食堂个个插红旗。贵州日报曾在一版头条地位作了报道，这个报道比较全面系统地接触到了办好食堂的一些基本问题。配合这条新闻，发表了“办好食堂，迎接春播高潮”的社论，肯定了义中管理区办食堂的经验，号召全省学习，并阐述了办好食堂对夺取春播胜利的重要意义。接着，又报道了毕节专区两万个食堂赶义中管理区食堂的消息。对黔南布依族苗族自治州都匀市新城公社的壅引食堂，也作了突出的报道。壅引食堂在加强领导、实行民主管理、养猪种菜、建立家底等方面都作得很出色，贵州日报1月19日以一版头条刊登了消息和中共黔南州委的批语；后来又以一个整版报道全州掀起赶壅引食堂的热潮。在食堂的民主管理方面，3月6日以一个专页报道了贵阳市花溪公社的大寨食堂，作为全省的范例，发表评论，号召全省都要像大寨食堂一样抓民主管理。为了使这个食堂的管理经验在全省更好地推广，3月22日，贵州日报全文发表了大寨食堂的管理暂行办法，作为各地食堂的借鉴。关于加强领导、贯彻阶级路线的问题，贵州日报3月12日在全面介绍绥阳县募阳公社办好食堂经验的时候，加以突出，同时发表了中共遵义地委的批语和地委秘书长的专文“要关心生产，首先关心人”，强调了必须加强党对食堂的具体领导和认真贯彻阶级路线。食堂的技术革新，对于办好食堂有重大的意义。贵州日报陆续报道了各专区、自治州和一些县、社广泛开展群众性炊具革新运动的情况，介绍了一些可以普遍推广的新炊具，还发表了“大力改革炊具”的社论。在树立各方面的标兵以后，3月18日，贵州日报把已经报道过的标兵食堂，集中在一个整版上，用诗画配的通俗易懂的形式，分别介绍了各个食堂的不同特点。这种做法既有声势地表彰了标兵食堂，加深了人们对标兵食堂的印象，也全面地介绍了办好食堂的基本经验，等于对全省标兵食堂作了一次总检阅。这段时期，贵州日报共组织食堂专版七个，发表头条消息十三条。
    深入重点，进行调查研究，发表有分量的调查报告，也是一种使食堂报道走向深入的方法。贵州日报2月10日发表的“食堂十好”就是一个例子。“食堂十好”是对两个县四个食堂的调查报告。这种有事实有分析的调查文章，对食堂的优越性作了充分有力的说明，使人们系统地理解公共食堂的优越性和办好食堂的重大意义，对于提高人们对食堂的认识，是有重大作用的。
    抓典型、抓重点，不能忽视一般。配合典型报道，贵州日报还注意运用小镜头、小专栏、小通讯、小文章及图片专栏等灵活多样的形式，扩大报道地区和报道面，大量地反映了各级领导深入领导食堂的情况，介绍了多种多样的新炊具，报道了办好食堂后出现的新风气、新气象，表扬了勤勤恳恳的食堂管理人员和炊事人员。重点与一般相结合，使食堂报道既能红花夺目，又有绿叶扶衬；使食堂报道既反映了丰富多采的现实，又切实地指导了工作。
