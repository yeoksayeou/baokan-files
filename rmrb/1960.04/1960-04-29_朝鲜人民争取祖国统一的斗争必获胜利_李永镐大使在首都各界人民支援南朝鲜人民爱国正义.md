Comrades,

    When the South Korean people launched a struggle against the fascist colonial and plundering rule of U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, the people of Beijing and all the Chinese people gave active support and concern. On behalf of the Korean people, I express my heartfelt gratitude for this.

    Your support and solidarity have become an important factor in inspiring the South Korean people to greater victories.

    As comrades are well aware, a grave and urgent situation has now emerged on the soil of South Korea.

    For more than two months, hundreds of thousands of South Korean people have continuously held demonstrations and uprisings in almost the entire South Korean region, demanding the abolition of the fascist reign of terror by U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique.

    Initially, the South Korean people's struggle began with peaceful demonstrations for survival, democratic rights, and freedom. However, the Syngman Rhee clique dispatched tanks and machine guns, indiscriminately firing on peaceful demonstrators making legitimate demands, which further aroused the people's anger.

    Even at this very moment, the South Korean people are being massacred in large numbers. The corpses of our brothers lie across every street in South Korea; the blood of peaceful residents has stained the land of South Korea red.

    The Syngman Rhee clique has not only massacred a large number of innocent people, but also barbarously and shamelessly stabbed corpses with bayonets, kicked them around, and threw them into the sea.

    A special martial law has been declared in the South Korean region, and a whirlwind of mass arrests has been unleashed.

    Today, this unprecedented bloody tragedy is precisely what the U.S. government, under the guise of the "United Nations," has created in South Korea, where American troops are stationed; it is precisely what has happened under the Syngman Rhee regime, which has always masqueraded as free and democratic.

    Now, it is very clear who should be held responsible for this bloody tragedy.

    The mastermind behind all this is U.S. imperialism, which occupies South Korea.

    If the U.S. imperialist aggressors did not occupy South Korea, the South Korean people would not have suffered such a catastrophe today.

    Currently, the flames of mass struggle burning day by day throughout the entire region of South Korea are an eruption of the mountainous anger accumulated over the fifteen years since the U.S. aggressors occupied the land of South Korea, and a manifestation of the South Korean people's unanimous desire and determination for a new politics, a new society, and a new life. Comrades!

    In order to realize its ambitions to invade Korea, U.S. imperialism created the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, which fundamentally does not conform to the will of the Korean people, and imposed an unprecedented fascist rule on the South Korean people.

    Moreover, the U.S. imperialist aggressors have completely controlled all the economic lifelines of South Korea and made them serve the war policy and colonial plunder policy.

    Due to the predatory economic policies of U.S. imperialism, South Korea's national industry is facing an unprecedented situation of bankruptcy, and agriculture has also been abandoned and has plummeted.

    Today, the South Korean people are extremely impoverished, and the standard of living is as low as it can be.

    The U.S. ruling clique and the Syngman Rhee clique also obstruct all efforts made by the Korean people to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland, pursue a policy of turning South Korea into a base for atomic weapons, and continue to engage in criminal conspiracies that threaten peace in the Far East and Asia.

    If U.S. imperialism had withdrawn its hand from South Korea, if the U.S. military had rolled out, then our motherland would have been unified long ago, and South Korea would have achieved democratic development long ago. The South Korean people would not have been groaning in such misfortune and pain today.

    This clearly shows that the entire responsibility for continuing the division of Korea and plunging the South Korean people into an abyss of suffering lies with the U.S. imperialist aggressors.

    It goes without saying that the entire responsibility for the recent bloodshed in South Korea also lies with the U.S. ruling clique.

    However, in order to escape responsibility for creating the situation in South Korea, U.S. imperialism has exhausted all kinds of deceptive means.

    The U.S. State Department has summoned officials of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime stationed in the United States several times and has held secret talks with Syngman Rhee through the U.S. ambassador to South Korea.

    U.S. imperialism is playing various tricks to deceive the people, such as ordering its loyal servants to reorganize the puppet "government," "amend the constitution" to implement a "cabinet responsibility system," dissolve the "National Assembly," and hold "elections" again.

    The statement of the U.S. State Department, which claims to be a "supporter" and "ally" of the Syngman Rhee clique, can only conclusively prove that U.S. imperialism is the real master who issues instructions to and controls the Syngman Rhee clique.

    This fact also exposes to the world the stubborn stance of the U.S. aggressive clique: attempting to desperately maintain its loyal lackey—the ugly Syngman Rhee regime.

    While using deceptive means, they are also organizing the massacre of the South Korean people.

    U.S. imperialism dispatched the 15th Division of the "National Defense Forces" to massacre the people, and this division is under the command of its "headquarters," the so-called "United Nations Command."

    The demonstrators in South Korea are being brutally murdered by troops and police trained by the U.S. military, using U.S.-made tanks, armored vehicles, shells, and bullets.

    This serious fact itself thoroughly exposes the hypocritical face of the U.S. imperialist aggressors and convicts them of their criminal acts.

    U.S. imperialism must bear full responsibility for all the major misfortunes and sufferings it has caused to the Korean people, and for the bloodshed that continues in South Korea.

    Today, the way to resolve the current situation in South Korea and break the deadlock is: first of all, to force the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops, who have turned South Korea into such a land of hunger and poverty, such an unprecedentedly dark world, to withdraw immediately!

    There is no doubt that if all foreign troops withdraw from South Korea, and if external interference in Korean internal affairs ceases, the Korean issue will be peacefully resolved by the Korean people themselves through consultation.

    As pointed out in my party's letter to the South Korean people and the statement of the joint meeting of leaders of various political parties and social organizations, in order to resolve the fragmented situation in South Korea as soon as possible, we propose that a joint meeting of political parties and social organizations from North and South Korea be convened as soon as possible.

    In order to achieve this, we must force the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops to withdraw immediately, open the military demarcation line, and guarantee exchanges between the North and the South.

    Therefore, the Korean people resolutely struggle, demanding that the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops remove the illegally transported murderous weapons, including atomic and rocket weapons, and withdraw immediately. Dear Comrades!

    No deceptive means or brutal suppression by U.S. imperialism can stop the heroic struggle launched by the South Korean people for their own just and great cause.

    Today, the struggle momentum of the South Korean people, like a prairie fire, clearly demonstrates this.

    Syngman Rhee, the eternal traitor, has surrendered to the flames of the people's struggle, and the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, supported by the U.S. imperialist aggressive forces, has virtually collapsed.

    Under the unyielding struggle of the Korean people, the U.S. imperialist aggressive troops will inevitably roll out of South Korea.

    With the internationalist support and solidarity of the fraternal Chinese people, the Korean people will surely win in the sacred struggle to force the U.S. imperialist aggressors to roll out of our territory and to strive for the peaceful reunification of our motherland.

    Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the Korean and Chinese people!

    朝鲜人民争取祖国统一的斗争必获胜利
    李永镐大使在首都各界人民支援南朝鲜人民爱国正义斗争大会上的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    当南朝鲜人民掀起斗争，反对美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮法西斯殖民掠夺统治的时候，北京市人民和全体中国人民给予了积极的支持和关切，对此，我以朝鲜人民的名义，表示衷心的感谢。
    你们的这种支持和声援，今天已经成为鼓舞南朝鲜人民走向更大胜利的重要因素。
    同志们都很清楚，现在，南朝鲜土地上出现了刻不容缓的严重局势。
    两个多月以来，数十万南朝鲜人民，在几乎整个南朝鲜地区，连续举行示威和起义，要求废除美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的法西斯恐怖统治。
    起初，南朝鲜人民的斗争，是从争取生存、民主权利和自由的和平示威开始的。可是，李承晚匪帮却出动了坦克和机关炮，恣意射击提出正当要求的和平的示威群众，加倍地激起了人民的愤怒。
    就是现在这个时刻，南朝鲜人民也在大批遭到屠杀。南朝鲜的每一条街上，横着我们兄弟的尸体；和平居民的鲜血，染红了南朝鲜的土地。
    李承晚匪帮不仅大量屠杀无辜的人民，而且还野蛮无耻地用刺刀乱捅尸体，踢来踢去，扔进大海。
    南朝鲜地区已经宣布了特别戒严令，刮起了大逮捕的旋风。
    今天，这一史无前例的流血大惨案，正是美国政府打着“联合国”的幌子，在美国军队驻扎下的南朝鲜制造的，正是发生在一直伪装自由和民主的李承晚政权之下。
    现在，非常清楚，到底是谁应该对这一流血大惨案负责。
    制造这一切的元凶，正是霸占着南朝鲜的美帝国主义。
    如果没有美帝国主义侵略者霸占南朝鲜，南朝鲜人民就不会遭受今天这样的浩劫。
    目前，南朝鲜整个地区一天天燃烧起来的群众性斗争烈火，是美国侵略者侵占南朝鲜土地以后十五年来堆积如山的愤怒的爆发，是南朝鲜人民要求新政治、新社会和新生活的一致愿望和决心的表示。同志们！
    美帝国主义为了实现它侵略朝鲜的野心，制造了根本不符合朝鲜人民意志的李承晚傀儡政权，把史无前例的法西斯统治强加在南朝鲜人民头上。
    不但这样，美帝国主义侵略者还完全掌握了南朝鲜的一切经济命脉，并使它们为实现战争政策和殖民地掠夺政策服务。
    由于美帝国主义掠夺性的经济政策，南朝鲜民族工业面临着从未有过的破产局面，农业也荒废不堪，一落千丈。
    今天，南朝鲜人民极其贫困，生活水平低得不能再低。
    美国统治集团和李承晚匪帮还阻挠朝鲜人民为争取祖国和平统一所做的一切努力，在南朝鲜奉行原子武器基地化政策，继续进行威胁远东和亚洲和平的罪恶的阴谋活动。
    如果美帝国主义已经把手从南朝鲜缩回去，如果美国军队已经滚出去，那么我们的祖国早就会统一了，南朝鲜早就会实现民主发展。南朝鲜人民也早就不会在今天这样的不幸和痛苦中呻吟了。
    这清楚地说明，使朝鲜继续分裂，使南朝鲜人民陷入苦难深渊的全部责任，就在美帝国主义侵略者身上。
    不言而喻，最近南朝鲜发生的流血事件的全部责任，也在美国统治集团身上。
    然而，美帝国主义为了逃脱造成南朝鲜局势的责任，用尽了各种欺骗手段。
    美国国务院曾经几次传唤李承晚傀儡政权驻美国的官吏，并且通过美国驻南朝鲜大使同李承晚进行秘密会谈。
    美帝国主义正在耍各种花招欺骗人民，如命它的忠仆改组傀儡“政府”，“修改宪法”以实行“内阁责任制”。解散“民议院”，重新举行“选举”，等等。
    自称是李承晚匪帮的“支持者”和“盟友”的美国国务院的声明，只能确凿地证明美帝国主义是向李承晚匪帮发出指令并统辖它的真正主子。
    这一事实也向全世界暴露了美国侵略集团的顽固立场：企图拼命维持它的忠实走狗——丑恶的李承晚政权。
    它们一方面使用欺骗手段，一方面则组织对南朝鲜人民的大屠杀。
    美帝国主义出动了“国防军”第十五师屠杀人民，而这个师是受它的“司令部”，即所谓“联合国军司令部”的指挥的。
    南朝鲜的示威群众，正受到美军训练出来的军队和警察用美国制造的坦克、装甲车、炮弹和枪弹的惨杀。
    这一严重事实本身，彻底暴露了美帝国主义侵略者的伪善面目，并且给它的犯罪行为定了罪。
    美帝国主义，对于它给朝鲜人民造成的一切重大不幸和痛苦，对于现在还在南朝鲜继续的流血惨案，必须负起全部责任。
    今天，解决南朝鲜目前局势、打开局面的道路是：首先迫使把南朝鲜变为今天这样饥饿和贫穷的土地、这样空前黑暗的天地的美帝国主义侵略军队立即撤出去！
    毫无疑问，如果一切外国军队撤出南朝鲜，如果对朝鲜内政的外部干涉停止的话，朝鲜问题便会由朝鲜人民自己通过协商方式和平解决。
    正如我党告南朝鲜人民书和各政党、社会团体领袖联席会议声明所指出的，现在，我们为了早日解决南朝鲜支离破碎的局面，建议尽速召开南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体联席会议。
    为了实现这一点，必须迫使美帝国主义侵略军队立即撤走，开放军事分界线，保障南北之间的来往。
    因此，朝鲜人民坚决斗争，要求美帝国主义侵略军队收起非法运进的杀人武器，包括原子和火箭武器在内，立即撤出去。亲爱的同志们！
    美帝国主义的任何欺骗手段和任何野蛮的镇压，都阻挡不住南朝鲜人民为了自己正当的伟大事业而掀起的英勇斗争。
    今天，南朝鲜人民势如燎原烈火的斗争气势，清楚地显示了这一点。
    万古逆贼李承晚已经向人民的斗争气焰投降，美帝国主义侵略势力所扶植的李承晚傀儡政权，实际上已经崩溃了。
    在朝鲜人民不屈不挠的斗争下，美帝国主义侵略军队必然会滚出南朝鲜。
    受到兄弟般的中国人民国际主义的支持和声援的朝鲜人民，在迫使美帝国主义侵略者滚出我国疆土、争取自己祖国和平统一的神圣斗争中，一定会获得胜利。
    朝中两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
