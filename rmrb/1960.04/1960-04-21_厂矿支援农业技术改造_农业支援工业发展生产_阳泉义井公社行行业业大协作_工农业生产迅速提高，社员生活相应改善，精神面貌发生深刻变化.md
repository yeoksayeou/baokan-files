Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 20th: Since its establishment more than a year ago, the Yijing People's Commune in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province—an urban people's commune centered on industrial and mining enterprises, with the participation of workers, farmers, and street residents—has seen rapid increases in industrial and agricultural production, corresponding improvements in people's lives, and profound changes in people's spiritual outlook.

During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Yangquan City's state-owned Third and Fourth Coal Mines, in order to resolve the contradiction between concentrated factory production and the dispersed living of employees, massively adjusted employee dormitories. The method of adjustment was to divide residential areas by pithead and workshop, and to establish a complete set of political and economic life networks based on the dormitories. The result of this was not only to facilitate the production of employees, but also to organize employees and their families from production to life in its entirety. The broad masses of families freed themselves from household chores and participated in socialist construction, setting up many "satellite" factories according to the needs of factory production. With the participation of a large number of employees' families in production, collective welfare undertakings such as nurseries, canteens, and service stations have also been further developed. The superiority of collective production and life attracted the people of the city, and employees, families, and citizens of the city asked to be organized and to follow the path of the Third and Fourth Mines. It was on this basis that the first urban people's commune in Yangquan City—the Mining Area People's Commune—was established on October 1, 1958. The Yijing People's Commune was originally one of the management areas of the Mining Area People's Commune, and was reorganized into a commune in February of this year.

The Yijing People's Commune includes twenty-five large and small factories and mines, state-owned and city-run, including iron and steel, coal, machinery, electrical porcelain, and chemicals; fourteen agricultural management areas mainly producing vegetables; and a street residents' committee. The commune has a total of 32,381 people, of whom 28% are employees, 32.5% are farmers, and 39.5% are employees' families and citizens.

Since the establishment of the commune, under the unified leadership of the commune Party committee, large-scale production collaborations have been launched, helping and promoting each other, ensuring the continuous Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. Before the establishment of the commune, although these departments also had cooperative relationships, they were not frequent enough, and there were contradictions in some specific issues. For example, factory expansion required the occupation of some land, and disputes had arisen over the use of transportation resources between large and small factories, and over the use of water resources between industry and agriculture. After the establishment of the commune, a comprehensive plan was made for all work, and many contradictions were thus resolved.

Chemical plants, the Youth Iron and Steel Plant, and the Nanzhuang Coal Mine and other factories and mines, in order to enable the agricultural areas to rapidly realize technological transformation, provided strong support from the training of technical personnel to the maintenance of machinery. In the past year or so, in the fourteen agricultural management areas, twelve areas have been electrified, and six areas have achieved electric pumping of water, enabling many production links to have electric operation and many residents' homes to have electric lighting. In particular, since last winter and this spring, factories and mines have helped agricultural areas to carry out large-scale water conservancy construction, digging mechanical deep wells, building reservoirs, and drawing water from old coal mine wells up the mountains. Three large-scale water conservancy projects are currently underway. After these projects are completed by the end of April, the area of irrigated land in the commune will increase from 900 mu to 6,000 mu, of which the area of high-grade garden-like irrigated land will increase to 2,200 mu. The factories and mines are also linked to the agricultural areas, contracting to repair agricultural machinery by zone. During the busy farming season, the factories and mines also organize employees to support agricultural production. In this year's drought resistance and wheat watering, the factories and mines organized 2,600 people and universally watered all 130 mu of wheat in the commune in three days. Thanks to the efforts of all commune members and the support of factories and mines, last year the total vegetable production of the commune increased by 60% compared with the previous year, the average yield per mu increased by 28%, and the average grain yield per mu increased by 22.4%.

The peasant masses of this commune also, with a high degree of communist spirit, fully support industrial production and construction, especially in providing labor and transportation power to the factories and mines. In order to solve the problem of transportation of raw materials and products for factories and mines throughout the commune, the commune built a six-kilometer light railway from the Nanzhuang Coal Mine to Baiyangshu Station last year, and the agricultural area dispatched 230 strong laborers to participate in the road construction. In the past, the Youth Iron and Steel Plant often stopped work due to the untimely delivery of ore. The agricultural area then extracted transportation tools to support the Youth Iron and Steel Plant in transporting materials, ensuring a continuous supply of raw materials to the Iron and Steel Plant, with production booming, and the daily production of pig iron gradually rising from 40 or 50 tons to 120 tons. Thanks to the strong support from the agricultural area in the supply of raw materials and transportation, the output value of the refractory materials factory has been increasing month by month. The output value in March of this year increased by 26.23% compared with February and 50.25% compared with January. The agricultural areas also mobilize the masses to collect raw materials such as adobe, refractory clay, iron ore, and coal, according to the production needs of the factories and mines, and supply them to the factories and mines. At the same time, in addition to completing the state's task of allocating commodity vegetables, the agricultural management areas supplied large quantities of vegetables and non-staple foods to the factories and mines, and this year also supported a large number of vegetable seedlings and livestock, and sent technicians to help the factories and mines establish non-staple food production bases.

All the large and small factories and mines in the commune have also launched collaborations, achieving mutual support when one factory has a problem. Now the entire commune has formed a production collaboration network. The masses sing praises: "The people's commune has great strength, all walks of life become one family, no matter how big the difficulties, everywhere is full of happy flowers."

The commune-run industry of Yijing Commune has also developed rapidly in the past year or so. At the beginning of 1958, there were only iron and wood processing groups serving agriculture. After more than a year of development, Yijing Commune has now established nine factories including refractory materials factories, bauxite factories, brick and tile factories, iron and wood processing factories, foundry factories, shoe factories, and sewing factories. These factories were all started from scratch and through self-reliance. They adopted the method of producing, selling externally, earning profits, increasing equipment, and supporting factories with factories, gradually expanding production. Last year, the profits of the commune-run factories increased eight point eight times compared with the previous year, which further promoted the development of the commune's industry. The total output value of commune-run industry was only 67,000 yuan in 1958, but increased to 1.29 million yuan in 1959. This year, it is planned to build five new factories, including chemical processing factories and vegetable processing factories, and the output value will increase to 5 million yuan.

With the great development of production, the families of employees and street women happily freed themselves from the shackles of the kang and the stove, and participated in social production. In the past year or so, more than 1,000 family members and citizens have participated in factory production, and a large number of people are engaged in factory auxiliary labor and social labor such as selecting ore, selecting coal, boiling black alum, bundling bricks and tiles, weaving, sewing, and washing. 88% of the families and citizens in the commune have changed from consumers to producers. After a large number of people participated in collective production, the scattered way of life was no longer suitable. According to the demands of the masses, the commune set up 123 public canteens, 303 nurseries and kindergartens, and 26 service stations. 80.2% of the people in the commune have participated in collective life.

While launching a hot and exciting production upsurge, this commune has also seen an upsurge in studying culture, studying theory, and studying technology. The commune has two middle schools, twenty-one primary schools, and more than 4,500 students; it has also established sixteen amateur red and expert schools, one amateur university, and three scientific research institutes, with more than 1,000 people participating in scientific and technological research; 70% of the commune members have participated in theoretical study. In addition, eighteen clubs, nine broadcasting stations, thirty-nine amateur theatrical troupes, and three film projection teams have also been established.

    厂矿支援农业技术改造
    农业支援工业发展生产  阳泉义井公社行行业业大协作
    工农业生产迅速提高，社员生活相应改善，精神面貌发生深刻变化
    新华社太原20日电　以工矿企业为中心，有工人、农民、街道居民参加的城市人民公社——山西省阳泉市义井人民公社，建社一年多来，工农业生产迅速提高，人民生活也相应地得到改善，人们的精神面貌也发生了深刻的变化。
    阳泉市国营第三、四煤矿，在1958年生产大跃进中，为解决厂矿集中生产和职工居住分散的矛盾，大规模地调整了职工宿舍。调整的方法是以坑口、车间为单位划分住宅区，并且以宿舍为阵地建立了一整套政治工作网和经济生活网。这样做的结果，不仅便利了职工的生产，而且将职工和家属从生产到生活全部组织起来。广大家属纷纷摆脱家务琐事，参加社会主义建设，根据厂矿生产需要，办起了许多“卫星”厂。随着大批职工家属参加生产，托儿所、食堂、服务站等集体福利事业也有了进一步的发展。集体生产和生活的优越性吸引着全市人民，全市职工、家属、市民纷纷要求组织起来，走三、四矿的道路。就在这样的基础上，1958年10月1日成立了阳泉市第一个城市人民公社——矿区人民公社。义井人民公社原是矿区人民公社的管理区之一，在今年2月改组成立公社。
    义井人民公社包括国营和市营的钢铁、煤炭、机械、电瓷、化工等二十五座大小厂矿，十四个以生产蔬菜为主的农业管理区，一个街道居民委员会，全社共有三万二千三百八十一人，其中职工占28％，农民占32.5％，职工家属和市民占39.5％。
    自从公社成立以来，在公社党委的统一领导下，展开生产大协作，互相帮助，互相促进，保证了工农业生产的连续大跃进。在公社成立以前，这些部门虽然也都有协作关系，但是不够经常，而且在一些具体问题上有矛盾。如厂矿扩建要占用一部分土地，大厂小厂在使用运输力量上，工业、农业在使用水源上，都曾发生过争执。公社成立以后，对各项工作有了通盘部署，许多矛盾都因此迎刃而解。
    化工厂、青年钢铁厂、南庄煤矿等厂矿，为了使农业区迅速实现技术改造，从培养技术人员到检修机械等，都给予了大力支援。一年多来，在十四个农业管理区中，已有十二个区通了电，六个区实现了提水电气化，使许多生产环节有了电力操作，许多居民家庭有了电灯照明。特别是从去冬今春以来，各厂矿帮助农业区大兴水利建设，打机械深井，建蓄水池，并从煤矿旧井中提水上山，目前还在进行三项规模较大的水利工程，这些工程到4月底完工以后，全社水地面积就将由九百亩增加到六千亩，其中高级园田化的水地将增加到二千二百亩。各厂矿还和农业区挂钩，分片包干检修农业机械。农忙季节，各厂矿还组织职工支援农业生产。在今年抗旱浇麦中，各厂矿组织了二千六百人，在三天内将全社一百三十亩小麦普遍浇了一次。由于全体社员的努力和厂矿的支援，去年全社蔬菜总产量比前年增长了60％，平均亩产量增长了28％，粮食平均亩产量增长了22.4％。
    这个公社的农民群众也是以高度的共产主义精神，全力支援工业生产建设，特别是向厂矿支援劳力和运输力量上出力最大。公社为了解决全社范围内各厂矿原料、产品的运输问题，去年从南庄煤矿到白羊墅车站修建了一条六公里的轻便铁路，农业区便调派了二百三十名精壮劳力，参加筑路。青年钢铁厂过去常常因矿石运送不及时而停工待料，农业区便抽出运输工具，支援青年钢铁厂运料，保证了钢铁厂的原料供给源源不断，生产蒸蒸日上，日产生铁由四、五十吨逐渐上升到一百二十吨。耐火材料厂由于得到农业区原料供应和运输上的大力支援，产值逐月上升，今年3月份的产值比2月增长了26.23％，比1月增长了50.25％。农业区还根据厂矿生产需要，发动群众采?土、耐火土、铁矿石和煤炭等原料材料，供给各厂矿。同时，各农业管理区在完成国家调拨商品菜的任务以外，向各厂矿供应了大批蔬菜、副食品，今年又支援了大批菜秧、畜力，并派出技术人员帮助厂矿建立副食品生产基地。
    全社各大、小厂矿之间也展开了协作，做到一厂有事，八方支援。现在全社已组成了一个生产协作网。群众歌颂说：“人民公社力量大，各行各业成一家，天大困难也不怕，处处开满幸福花。”
    义井公社的社办工业一年多来也有了飞跃的发展。1958年初，这里仅有为农业服务的铁木加工小组等，经过一年多的发展，目前义井公社已经建立起耐火材料厂、矾土厂、砖瓦厂、铁木加工厂、翻砂厂、鞋厂、缝纫厂等九座工厂。这些工厂都是白手起家、自力更生办起来的。他们采取边生产、边外销、赚回利润边增加设备、以厂养厂的方法、逐渐扩大生产。去年社办工厂的利润就比前年增长了八点八倍，这样就进一步促进了公社工业的发展。社办工业的生产总值1958年仅有六万七千多元，1959年就增加到一百二十九万元，今年计划再新建化工加工厂、蔬菜加工厂等五座工厂，产值将增长到五百万元。
    随着生产大发展，职工家属和街道妇女喜笑颜开地摆脱了炕台、锅台的束缚，参加了社会的生产。一年多来，已有一千多名家属和市民参加厂矿生产，还有大批人从事选矿石、选煤、熬黑矾、捆砖瓦、编织、缝洗等工厂辅助劳动和社会劳动，全社有88％的家属和市民由消费者变成了生产者。大批人参加集体生产以后，分散的生活方式已不相适应，公社便根据群众的要求，办起公共食堂一百二十三个，托儿所、幼儿园三百零三处，服务站二十六个，全社已有80.2％的人参加了集体生活。
    这个公社在掀起热气腾腾的生产高潮的同时，出现了学文化、学理论、学技术的高潮。全社现有中学二所、小学二十一所，在校学生达四千五百余人；还办起业余红专学校十六所，业余大学一所，科学研究所三所，有一千多人参加了科学技术研究工作；全社还有70％的社员参加了理论学习。此外，还建立了俱乐部十八座，广播站九座，业余剧团三十九个，电影放映队三个。
