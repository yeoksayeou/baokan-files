Revolution in the Organization of Coal Industry Production
*People's Daily* Commentator

Since the implementation of the four (shift) eight (hour) cross-operation system (hereinafter referred to as "four-eight cross-operation") in China's coal mine enterprises starting last winter, more and more mining areas have adopted this advanced operation system. As of now, 1,412 coal mining faces (accounting for more than 80% of all coal mining faces in key coal mines) and 2,832 tunneling faces (accounting for more than 60% of all tunneling faces in key coal mines) in key coal mine enterprises across the country have adopted this advanced operation system. This is a major change in the organizational form of production for the continuous leap forward in the coal industry. This change fully demonstrates its great role in rapidly developing productive forces and points out the direction for other mining industries to improve production organization and promote the rapid development of productive forces.

"Four-eight cross-operation" means changing the original three shifts of production to four shifts and changing the original parallel flow operation to cross-operation. It rationally adjusts labor between shifts, processes, and types of work, makes full use of idle time, and cooperates rhythmically to achieve balanced production. Once this advanced production organization method was promoted, it rapidly pushed the productive forces of China's coal industry to a new peak. According to rough statistics, coal production generally increased by 10% to 20%, and labor efficiency increased by 10% to 30% in coal mining faces that implemented the "four-eight cross-operation." The 50 tunneling faces of the Shandong Provincial Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau achieved an average daily progress increase of 20% to 30%, and labor efficiency increased by 20% to 25%. Due to the significant increase in production efficiency, the cost of coal mining and tunneling has decreased by about 10%. Facts most clearly demonstrate the tremendous promoting effect of this new production organization form on production development.

The contradiction between production relations and productive forces is the driving force of social production development. With the development of productive forces, production organizations must be adjusted and transformed accordingly. Consciously and actively adjusting and improving production relations is the fundamental reason for the high-speed development of socialist productive forces. The continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 significantly improved the production technology and equipment level of the coal industry. The past three-shift parallel flow operation production organization form could no longer meet the new needs of productive forces development. On the one hand, there were production gaps between shifts, and the time for production preparation occupied the time directly used for production, hindering the increase in coal production. On the other hand, due to the unbalanced workload between the various processes of the coal mining face, it was inevitable that some people were idle and had nothing to do. Generally, fewer people were needed at the beginning of entering the well to drill holes and blast; but when it came to digging coal and loading rocks, the workload increased, and there was a feeling of insufficient manpower, forming the long-standing "loose at the beginning and tight at the end" production situation on the coal mine working face. By implementing the "four-eight cross-operation" system, the next shift enters the working face two hours in advance, which not only allows for the early preparation of production but also allows the surplus labor force to be used to support the previous shift, completing the previous shift's task of digging coal and loading rocks in advance, so that workers can ascend the well on time, organically combining work and leisure. This fundamentally broke the old "routine" of "loose at the beginning and tight at the end" on the working face, connected the production of the upper and lower shifts, increased effective production time, improved labor productivity, established a balanced and rhythmic new routine, and created extremely favorable conditions for the continuous leap forward of the entire coal mine production. At the same time, through the reform of production organization, the communist spirit of collaboration between shifts was consolidated and promoted, and workers' concern for the production of their own shift and for the increased production of the entire working face was also combined. As a result of the "four-eight cross-operation," workers also had more leisure time. This allows them more opportunities to engage in political, cultural, and technical learning, and more time to study and think about technological innovation and other issues. This has a more profound revolutionary significance for the further development of productive forces in the future.

Making full use of production time, rationally using manpower, and better achieving the combination of work and leisure are extremely important aspects of enterprise management. The "four-eight cross-operation" system of coal mine enterprises provides successful experience in this regard. This experience is basically applicable to other mining industries with similar production characteristics. In general industrial production, the phenomenon of unbalanced workload between various types of work and processes is also common. How to reasonably and correctly organize cross-operation according to one's own production characteristics, increase production time, and eliminate the phenomenon of "loose at the beginning and tight at the end" or "tight at the beginning and loose at the end" in production is of great significance for ensuring the continuous leap forward of production. At present, the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution across the country is surging forward along a correct, scientific, and nationwide direction. Many types of work and processes in many factories, mines, and construction sites that were still manual operations yesterday have become mechanized, semi-mechanized, or even automated and semi-automated production today. The production of many products often completes the workload of a month or even a year or more in a day or several hours due to one or several innovations. Under the circumstance of such rapid development of productive forces, it is very necessary for various enterprise departments to timely adjust various aspects of production relations, improve production organization and management, and actively, proactively, and consciously utilize objective laws to create conditions for the accelerated growth and development of new things, and promote the accelerated realization of changes in objective things according to people's wishes.

We hope that the "four-eight cross-operation" method of coal mine enterprises will be quickly promoted in all departments of a similar nature and play a greater role.

    煤炭工业生产组织上的革命	本报评论员
    我国煤矿企业从去年冬天开始推行四（班）八（小时）交叉作业制（以下简称“四、八交叉作业”）以来，采用这一先进作业制的矿区已经越来越多。截至现在为止，全国重点煤矿企业中已经有一千四百一十二个采煤工作面（占重点煤矿全部采煤工作面的80％以上），二千八百三十二个掘进工作面（占重点煤矿全部掘进工作面的60％以上）采用了这种先进作业制。这是煤炭工业实现持续跃进的一次生产组织形式的重大变革。这个变革，充分地展示出它对高速度发展生产力的巨大作用，并且为其它采掘工业指出了改进生产组织、促进生产力高速度发展的方向。
    “四、八交叉作业”就是把原来的三班生产改为四班生产，把原来的平行流水作业改为交叉作业。使上下班各工序、工种之间，合理地调剂劳动力，充分的利用空闲时间，有节奏地协作配合，均衡生产。这个先进生产组织方式一经推广，就迅速地把我国煤炭工业生产力推向了一个新的高峰。据粗略统计，凡是推广了“四、八交叉作业”的采煤工作面，原煤产量一般都提高了10％到20％，劳动效率提高了10％到30％；山东省煤矿基本建设局的五十个掘进工作面，平均日进度提高20％到30％，劳动效率提高20％—25％。由于生产效率大大提高，采煤和掘进的成本都下降了10％左右。事实最明显地证明了这个新的生产组织形式对生产的发展具有巨大的促进作用。
    生产关系和生产力的矛盾是社会生产发展的动力，随着生产力的发展，生产组织必须进行相应的调整和变革。自觉地、主动地调整和改善生产关系，是社会主义生产力高速度发展的根本原因。1958和1959两年的连续大跃进，使煤炭工业的生产技术与设备水平有了显著的提高，过去三班平行流水作业的生产组织形式就不能适应生产力发展的新的需要了。一方面因为班与班之间存在着生产间隙，而且生产准备时间占去了直接用于生产的时间，阻碍着煤炭产量的提高；另一方面，又由于采煤工作面各工序间的工作量不均衡，不可免地有一部分人闲着没事干。一般是开初下井打眼、放炮时用人不多；而到了攉煤、装岩石时，工作量增大，又感到人力不足，形成了煤矿工作面上由来已久的“前松后紧”的生产状况。实行“四、八交叉作业”制，下一班提前两小时进入工作面，既可以提前作好生产准备工作，又可以把多余的劳动力用来支援上一班，提前完成上一班攉煤、装岩石的任务，使工人可以按时升井，把劳与逸有机的结合起来。这就从根本上破除了工作面上“前松后紧”的老“常规”，使上下班生产连成一气，增加了有效生产时间，提高了劳动生产率，建立起均衡的、有节奏的新常规，给整个煤矿生产的持续跃进创造了极为有利的条件。同时，通过生产组织的变革，巩固和发扬了班与班之间的共产主义协作思想，工人们关心本班生产和关心整个工作面增产也结合起来了。由于“四、八交叉作业”的结果，工人们业余时间也增多了。这就使他们有更多的机会从事政治、文化、技术学习，有更多的时间来研究、思考革新技术等问题。这对今后进一步发展生产力具有更加深广的革命意义。
    充分利用生产时间，合理地使用人力，更好的作到劳逸结合是企业管理上一个极为重要的方面。煤矿企业的“四、八交叉作业”制在这方面提供了成功经验。这个经验，对于具有同样生产特点的其它采掘工业是基本上适用的。就一般的工业生产来看，各工种、工序间工作量不均衡的现象也是普遍的。如何根据自身的生产特点，合理、正确地组织交叉作业，增加生产时间，消除生产上的“前松后紧”或是“前紧后松”的现象，对于保证生产的持续跃进有着重大的意义。目前，全国技术革新与技术革命的群众运动正以波浪相逐之势，沿着一条正确的、科学的和全民的方向澎湃展开。许多工厂、矿山、工地的许多工种、工序，昨天还是手工操作，今天就变成了机械化、半机械化甚至自动化、半自动化的生产了；许多产品的生产往往由于一项或几项的革新，就使一月甚至一年以上的工作量在一天或是几个小时里完成了。在这种生产力飞速发展的情况下，各个企业部门及时地调整各方面的生产关系，改进生产组织与管理，主动地、积极地、自觉地利用客观规律，为新事物的加速成长和发展创造条件，促使客观事物的变化按照人的意愿加速实现。这是十分必要的。
    愿煤矿企业的“四、八交叉作业”的方法，在一切性质类似的部门很快得到推广，发挥更大的作用。
