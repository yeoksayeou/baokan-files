Heroic Changsha Forever Young
	Xingsha
	The beautiful Xiang River accompanies Changsha day and night, listening to Changsha's progress.
	The Xiang River's rolling waves sing of this ancient and magical city with its three thousand-year history, praising its heroic achievements and youthful spirit!
	In 1917, from the very first day Comrade Mao Zedong began organizing the "New People's Study Society," the spark of revolution ignited in the land of Changsha. From then on, the voice of truth echoed in the ancient Chuanshan Academy, and the toiling masses gathered before the small house in Qingshuitang.
	Comrade Mao Zedong often came to the workers' residences barefoot in straw sandals and wearing a coarse cloth jacket. Wherever he went, he sowed the seeds of revolution. Wherever he went, the revolutionary mass movement surged like a tide. In a short time, by 1922, the workers' movement in Changsha reached its climax, invincible and victorious at every step.
	So many legendary stories occurred in those years when the red storm shook the heavens and the earth. When the strike wave of the mud and wood workers rose, the workers went to the then Changsha County Yamen to petition for a wage increase. Unreasonably refused, Comrade Mao Zedong stood with the workers, leading the shouting of slogans and encouraging everyone. He carried a whistle; he blew it once, and the workers shouted a sentence. With continuous blowing and shouting, the morale of the masses was even higher. The minions in the yamen realized he was the leader, so they came to arrest him. Comrade Mao Zedong went through several trees by the wall and ran into the workers' ranks. People spread the word: "When the workers shout their slogans, the tiles of Changsha County fly!"
	The Xiang River roared, the flames of revolution spread and expanded, unstoppable. The enemy launched a frantic counterattack. In the May 21st Incident, Changsha was bathed in blood, but the revolutionary people did not despair or become pessimistic. When one warrior fell, thousands of warriors stood up, and the martyrs erected monuments with their brilliant lives.
	We remember that name most beloved by the people and most feared by the enemy—Guo Liang, one of Comrade Mao Zedong's best students and capable assistants. In those years, he and the railway workers took the lead in lying on the cold, gleaming rails, using their chests to block the military vehicles that came to suppress the strike. His noble spirit made the wheels tremble and the enemy retreat. Before the butchers, he calmly wrote the will "to continue my aspirations." The reactionaries hung the head of this twenty-eight-year-old young Communist Party member in Simenkou, the most crowded place in the city, and in Tongguan, the place where he first engaged in the workers' movement. However, this did not subdue the people. Workers and students filled with grief and indignation came to bid farewell to the respected revolutionary martyr. In Tongguan, the workers braved the danger to their lives to visit Guo Liang's home to express their condolences.
	The brilliance of Comrade Mao Zedong's early revolutionary activities illuminated the path for revolutionaries and nurtured the first batch of revolutionary fighters. The blood of countless martyrs watered the flowers of revolution. Changsha is how it won the glory of a red city and became one of the cradles of revolution in the motherland. The memorial sites of the activities of the leader and revolutionary predecessors, such as Aiwanting Pavilion, the First Normal School, Chuanshan Academy, Wangluyuan, and Qingshuitang, have a great attraction for people. Ten years, twenty years, thirty years... how many days have passed, the glorious revolutionary tradition has taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit among the people of Changsha. People proudly call their city the hometown of Chairman Mao. People deeply bury the heroic deeds of the revolutionary martyrs in their hearts to inspire themselves to move forward. The Martyrs' Park Memorial Tower has been completed on Dujia Mountain in the east of the city. The tower is solemn and majestic, overlooking the entire city. Every day, the flow of people who come to pay homage to the memorial tower and remember the martyrs is endless, and there are clusters of flowers in front of the tower.
	The flames of revolution have turned into the red flames of construction. Red Changsha stands today at the foot of Lushan Mountain and on the banks of the Xiang River with a new posture as a socialist industrial city.
	If you cross the river to the west and stand on Orange Isle, where Chairman Mao once swam, you can see that the river is calm, and the shimmering green waves nourish the land of the people of Changsha. Thousands of ships, fully loaded with abundant supplies, transmit the good news of construction, coming from the south and going to the north. From the Laodao River, where Guan Yu of the Three Kingdoms wielded his knife, extending southward to the more than twenty-mile-long ground of Monkey Stone, houses are connected, and chimneys are like forests. During the day, when the sky is as blue as washing, gazing at the river, the wisps of smoke running out of the chimneys do not fly into the sky but enter the bottom of the water. At night, the firelight radiated from the chimneys turns into ten thousand points of golden stars in the river. On the shore, the trains of the Beijing-Guangzhou line roared past, echoing the whistles of the steamboats on the river.
	Faced with the inspiring construction scene before you, at this moment, you are filled with emotions. Ten years ago, warships flying the British and American flags were docked on the water here. The dark gun barrels pointed at the urban area, exerting the ferocity of beasts. At that time, foreign robbers bullied us because the rulers were corrupt and incompetent, because production was backward, because we had no steel, iron..., no, almost nothing. At that time, Changsha, known as the "Four Major Rice Markets," was completely a deformed consumer city. Ask the older generation, and they will tell you: Old Changsha only had rice to support the ruling class's enjoyment and bran for the rest.
	The people of Changsha, who had suffered from the bullying of robbers, all knew how important steel was. In 1958, through the great steelmaking movement of 130,000 people, in just over three months, not only thousands of tons of steel were seized, but also steelmaking and rolling mills, iron factories, coking plants... were built.
	At the city's advanced producers' representative meeting, people saw Chen Shaoyun, the leader of the Red Flag Steelmaking Team of Dongfeng Steel Plant, for the first time. Previously, this barber skillfully wielded light and quick scissors to trim slender strands of hair. Now he holds a steel drill like a pillar, directing the red clouds in the steelmaking furnace. The whole team often creates new records.
	How many Chen Shaoyuns are there on the emerging steel front? Their hands put steel ingots and steel products made in Changsha in the freight cars of the railway station and the trucks of the motor transport team, sending them to more than 20 cities across the country and to the vast countryside.
	Changsha and the countryside hold hands, and Changsha's industry bears the glorious task of supporting agriculture and supporting the communes. Every festival, the Workers' Cultural Palace in the city welcomes peasant brothers, and workers and peasants gather together. The workers always talk about what the factory is producing for the countryside, but it always seems endless. Count how many large, small, and modern factories there are in Changsha, and how many agricultural production machines, tools, and rural living materials these factories have manufactured? No, it's impossible to count them all at once.
	Not far from the bank of the lower reaches of the Xiang River is the huge factory building of the Hunan Agricultural Machinery Factory. In 1958, it began producing Fengshou brand tractors; soon, it will be expanded into the first tractor factory in Hunan. In the southern suburbs, there is the Changsha Water Pump Factory, which supplies batches of irrigation and drainage machinery to the countryside every year. When it was just liberated, this factory was just a small machinery factory with fewer than 100 people pieced together from dozens of private small machine shops, which could only undertake some scattered repair work. By 1953, the factory could only imitate one type of water pump, but last year the number of product varieties increased to seventy. In 1958, a 24-inch large water pump was successfully manufactured. Its power can lift 1,800 kilograms of water to a height of 79 meters. Starting such a machine can ensure that hundreds of thousands of people have no worries about eating and drinking water; a thousand acres of drought-stricken land will absorb enough sweet dew to relieve the drought in one hour. This is not the largest. The recently designed "Xiangjiang Giant Dragon" has a drainage capacity that is more than five times greater per hour.
	From nothing to something, from less to more, from small to large, what was not there in the past is now there, and it is more and better. This is the "routine" of Changsha's industrial construction and development, and every step leaves behind commendable achievements, and hundreds and thousands of outstanding sons and daughters emerge. Therefore, you will see how the people of Changsha have advanced in the footsteps of the revolutionary predecessors in the ten years of revolution and construction, how they have inherited and carried forward the noble and great revolutionary heroic spirit of the martyrs, and how they have held up the glorious banner of the general line higher and higher.
	Liu Zhengliang, a national people's representative and a construction worker who has been repeatedly named an advanced producer in the city, province, and country for twenty consecutive times, is one of the most touching advanced figures. Since liberation, not to mention that the construction engineering team he led has overfulfilled the state plan every year, and no safety accidents have occurred. The story of his shining with the light of collectivist thought can be woven into strings of crystal-clear pearls. Listen, in order to promote his advanced experience to construction sites throughout the city and province, he is willing to sacrifice half of his monthly salary without complaint. He carefully helped sixteen backward workers, and now most of these comrades have become advanced producers, and many have joined the Party. It was also he who sent outstanding technicians from his team to actively support his opponents in the socialist competition, so that his opponents quickly caught up. It was also he who overcame unbelievable difficulties in culture, wrote his advanced experience into a book word by word, composed it into dances, and often created literary and artistic works, and was elected as the vice chairman of the city's Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Recently, this ordinary worker has been appointed as a construction engineer.
	The noble communist ideological style is also concentratedly reflected in Hu Hanyun, a general worker at the Hunan Agricultural Machinery Factory. He seems to be a person of another kind of character, working silently and forgetting himself. Because of production needs, he was transferred from the piece-rate Qing Sha workshop to the time-rate heat treatment workshop. His monthly income was reduced a lot, but it did not affect his enthusiasm for work. On the contrary, he became more energetic. The leaders wanted to retain his original wage level, but he said, "What's important about more or less money! The working class engages in production for the people, not for a few dollars." In the heat treatment workshop, he created a double-layer furnace loading method that greatly improved work efficiency and also realized the mechanization of the original manual operation. Hu Hanyun's job has been changed many times, and it is in those most difficult and arduous places that he has contributed the greatest enthusiasm, perseverance, and creative labor of a Communist Party member.
	I should also introduce Qi Changdong, the old worker of Shuikoushan No. 1 Smelting Plant and the current smelting engineer, who is a "trailblazer" in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. In the old society, Qi Changdong was fired from the factory three times by the capitalists. The reason was that he had thought of a clever plan that could increase production and reduce the labor intensity of workers. The factory owner scolded him for "trying to be lazy" and drove him out of the factory gate. After liberation, Qi Changdong's wisdom was able to be fully utilized, and he constantly created miracles. The year before last, after several years of hard work and exploration, the major proposal that broke the world's conventional horizontal tank zinc smelting was finally realized, and a large number of zinc ingots were added to the country every year.
	Liu Zhengliang's proactive cooperation, the quality of helping others, Hu Hanyun's selfless labor and disregard for personal gains and losses, and Qi Changdong's style of daring to think, speak, and act are like a gentle spring breeze, blowing through thousands of households; new people and new things with communist ideological styles are emerging everywhere. All this makes people can't help but admire: Red Changsha! Heroic land! Lovely people!
	Looking forward to the future of Changsha makes you think of wonderful brocade embroidery. And the famous Xiang embroidery, which has enjoyed nearly a century of reputation at home and abroad, can be said to be home to Changsha. In the Xiang Embroidery Building on Wuyi Road, on thousands of embroidered surfaces, the beautiful and picturesque scenery of Xiaoxiang is fully visible, leading people to a poetic realm. From liberation to the present, the number of embroidery workers in Changsha has increased from more than 300 to more than 12,000. The embroidery girls have "revived" the beauty of the world and the great rivers and mountains. We praise this ever-youthful brocade embroidery, and we praise Changsha, which is always young!
	This is Aiwanting Pavilion on Yuelu Mountain in Changsha, where Comrade Mao Zedong often came to read and hold meetings during his early revolutionary activities.

    英雄长沙春长在
    星沙
    美丽的湘江，日日夜夜，陪伴着长沙，倾听着长沙前进的步伐。
    湘江波涛翻滚，歌唱这有三千年历史的古老而神奇的城市，赞颂她的英雄业迹和青春风貌！
    在1917年，当毛泽东同志开始组织“新民学会”的第一天，长沙的土地上，便燃烧起了革命的火苗。从此，古老的船山学社里，响着真理的声音；清水塘的小屋前，相聚着劳苦的群众。
    毛泽东同志常常赤脚草鞋，粗布短褂，来到工人的住宅。他走到哪里，哪里撒下了革命的种子。他来到哪里，哪里的革命群众运动便如潮如海。短短的时间，到1922年，长沙的工人运动达到了最高潮，所向披靡，步步胜利。
    多少传奇般的故事，发生在那些红色风暴震天动地的年月。泥木工人的罢工浪潮起来了，工人们到当时的长沙县衙门外请愿，要增加工资，被无理拒绝，毛泽东同志和工人们站在一起，领导呼喊口号，鼓舞大家。他带着口哨，吹一声，工人们喊一句，连吹连喊，群众的斗志更加高昂。衙门里的爪牙们发觉他是领头的，便来捉他，毛泽东同志从靠墙的几棵树当中穿过去，跑到工人队伍里去了。人们传说开来：“工人们的口号一喊，长沙县的瓦都起飞！”
    湘江在怒吼，革命的烽火蔓延、扩展，势不可挡，敌人疯狂反扑。马日事变，长沙沐浴在血泊里，但是，革命的人民没有绝望和悲观。一个战士倒下，千万个战士站起来，先烈们用灿烂的生命立下丰碑。
    我们记起那人民最亲切、敌人最恐惧的名字——郭亮，毛泽东同志最好的学生和得力助手之一。当年他和铁路工人一起，带头躺卧在寒光凛凛的铁轨上，用自己的胸膛第一个挡住开来镇压罢工的兵车。他那浩然正气，使车轮发抖，敌人败退。在屠夫们面前，他从容写下“以继余志”的遗书。反动派把这位二十八岁的年轻共产党员的头颅，悬挂在城里行人密集的司门口，以及他最初从事工人运动的地点铜官。然而这并没有使人民慑服，满怀悲愤的工人、学生，纷纷前来和敬爱的革命烈士告别。在铜官，工人们更是不顾生命的危险，到郭亮烈士的家里致哀悼唁。
    毛泽东同志初期的革命活动的光辉，照亮了革命者前进的路程，培育了第一批革命的战士。无数先烈的鲜血，浇灌着革命的花朵。长沙，就是这样赢得了红色城市的荣光，成了祖国的革命摇篮之一。当年领袖和革命前辈活动的纪念地，像爱晚亭、第一师范、船山学社、望麓园、清水塘，对于人们有着极大的吸引力。十年、二十年、三十年……，多少日子过去了，革命的光荣传统，在长沙人民当中生根、开花、结果。人们把自己的城市，骄傲地称为毛主席的故乡。人们把革命先烈的英雄事迹，深深埋藏在心底，激励自己前进。城东杜家山上，烈士公园纪念塔已经落成，塔身庄严雄伟，俯览全城。每天，拜谒纪念塔，缅怀先烈的人流终日不断，塔前鲜花成丛。
    革命的火光，化成了建设的赤焰。红色的长沙，今天以社会主义工业城市的崭新姿态，矗立在麓山之下，湘水之滨。
    你渡江西去，站上毛主席曾经在此游泳的橘子洲头，可以看见，这江上风平浪静，粼粼绿波滋润着人民长沙的土地；千轮百艇，满载丰盛的物资，传递建设的喜讯，南来北往；从市区北端当年三国关羽走刀的捞刀河，伸展南上，到猴子石的长二十多里的地面，屋宇繁接，烟囱如林。碧空如洗的白天，凝视江水，从烟囱里奔跑出来的缕缕浓烟，不是飞上天空，而是走进了水底；入夜，烟囱里放射的火光，在江水里变成了金星万点。岸上，京广线的火车，吼叫而过，和江上火轮的汽笛，互相呼应。
    面对着眼前动人心魄的建设图景，此刻，你真是万感交集。十年前，这里水面上停泊着挂米字旗、星条旗的军舰，黑黝黝的炮管，指向市区，使尽了野兽的威风。那时候外国强盗欺侮我们，是因为统治者腐败无能，因为生产落后，因为我们没有钢、铁……，没有，几乎什么都没有。那时候，号称“四大米市”的长沙，完全是一座畸形的消费城市。问问老一辈的人吧，他会告诉你：旧长沙除了供养统治阶级享受的大米，就是老糠而已。
    受尽强盗欺凌的长沙人民，都懂得钢是怎样重要。1958年，经过十三万人的大炼钢铁运动，三个多月里，不仅夺得了数千吨钢铁，还建设了炼钢轧钢厂、铁厂、焦厂……
    在市先进生产者代表会上，人们第一次看见了东风钢厂红旗炼钢班的班长陈少云。以前，这位理发工人，手里巧握轻快的刀剪，修剪纤细的发丝。如今他手头擎着天柱似的钢钎，指挥炼钢炉内的朵朵红云，全班经常创造崭新的纪录。
    新兴的钢铁战线上，该有多少个陈少云呢？他们的双手，使火车站的货车里，汽运队的卡车上，摆着长沙制造的钢锭、钢材，送往祖国二十多个城市，送往广大的农村。
    长沙和农村手挽着手，长沙的工业担负着支援农业，支援公社的光荣任务。每逢节日，市工人文化宫里，迎来了农民兄弟，工农欢聚在一起，工人总是谈起工厂里在给农村生产什么，然而每次都好像说不完。屈指数一数长沙有多少大的、小的、现代化的工厂，这些工厂又制造了多少农业生产机器、工具和农村生活资料呢？不行，一时简直数不清。
    就在湘江下游岸边不远，座落着湖南农业机械厂的巨大厂房。1958年，这里开始生产丰收牌拖拉机；不久，她将要扩建成为湖南第一座拖拉机厂。在南郊，有每年供给农村成批排灌机械的长沙水泵厂。这个工厂在刚解放时，还只是几十家私营小机器店拼凑拢来的不满百人的小型机械厂，当时只能承揽一些零星的修理杂活。到1953年，全厂也只能仿制一种水泵，而去年的产品品种却增加到了七十种。1958年制成功二十四时口径的大水泵，它的威力，可以把一千八百公斤的水量，举到七十九米的地方。发动一部这样的机器，几十万人的吃、用水，不用愁；一千亩受旱的田地，一小时里，会吸足解旱的甘露。这还不是最大的，最近设计成功的“湘江巨龙”，每个小时的排水量比它多了五倍以上。
    从无到有，从少到多，从小到大，过去没有的，今天有了，而且更多、更好了。这是长沙工业建设发展的“常规”，而每走一步，都留下了可歌可颂的伟迹，出现成百成千的优秀儿女，于是，你会看到，长沙人民在十年的革命和建设里，如何踏着革命先辈的脚迹前进，如何继承和发扬了烈士们崇高、伟大的革命英雄气质，更高更高地举起总路线的光荣旗帜。
    全国人民代表、曾经连续二十次当上全市、全省、全国先进生产者的建筑工人刘正良，是最感人的先进人物之一。解放以来，不必说他领导的建筑工程队年年超额完成国家计划，没有发生过安全事故。他那闪烁着集体主义思想光芒的故事，细讲起来，就可以编织成一串串晶莹璀灿的珍珠。听，他为着到全市、全省的工地上去推广自己的先进经验，宁愿每月牺牲一半的工资而毫无怨言。他细心帮助过十六个落后的工人，现在这些同志大部分当上了先进生产者，很多人入了党。还是他，在社会主义竞赛中派出自己队里优秀的技工去主动支援对手，使对手很快赶了上来。也是他，战胜文化上的令人难于相信的困难，把先进经验一字一句编写成书，编成舞蹈，还经常创作文艺作品，被选为市文联的副主席。最近，这个普通的工人，已经被任命为建筑工程师了。
    高尚的共产主义思想风格，同样在湖南农业机械厂普工胡汉云的身上集中地体现出来。他似乎是另一种性格的人，不声不响地劳动，忘却了自己。因为生产的需要，他从拿计件工资的清砂间调到拿计时工资的热处理间，一个月的收入减少了很多，不但没有影响劳动热情，反而劲头更足。领导上要给他保留原有的工资水平，他说：“钱多钱少，有什么要紧！工人阶级搞生产，为了人民，不是为着几个钱。”在热处理间，他创造了大大提高工效的双层装炉法，又使原来的手工操作实现了机械化。胡汉云的工作岗位调动过很多次，他就是在那些最艰苦最困难的地方，贡献一个共产党员的最大的热情、毅力和创造性的劳动。
    应该再介绍一下技术革新和技术革命运动里的“闯将”，水口山第一冶炼厂的老工人、现在的冶炼工程师齐昌栋。在旧社会，齐昌栋被资本家三次开除出厂。原因是他想过能够增加生产也可以减轻工人劳动强度的巧计，工厂的厂主骂他“打懒主意”，赶他出厂门。解放以后，齐昌栋的智慧能够充分施展了，他不断地创造奇迹。前年，经过前后几年努力探索而打破了世界横罐炼锌常规的重大建议，终于实现，每年替国家增加大量锌块。
    刘正良的主动协作，助人为乐的品质，胡汉云忘我劳动、不计个人得失的精神，齐昌栋敢想敢说敢做的风格，像拂煦的春风，吹遍千家万户；具有共产主义思想风格的新人新事，处处涌现。这一切，使人不能不赞叹着：红色的长沙！英雄的土地！可爱的人民！
    展望长沙的未来，使你想到美妙的锦绣。而享有近百年中外声誉的著名的湘绣，可以说得上是以长沙为家的。在五一路湘绣大楼，千条万幅绣面上，山明水秀的潇湘风光，尽览无遗，把人引到诗一般的境界。解放到现在，长沙的绣工从三百多人，增加到了一万二千多人。绣花姑娘们绣“活”了人间美景，大好山河。我们赞美这青春常驻的锦绣，更赞美自己的青春常驻的长沙！
    这是长沙岳麓山的爱晚亭，是毛泽东同志早期进行革命活动时常来读书和开会的地方。
