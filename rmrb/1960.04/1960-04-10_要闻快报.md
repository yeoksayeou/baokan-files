    "Wang Guofan on the Industrial Front"
    In Ningwu County, Shanxi Province, nine heroic women have emerged. They are: Nie Suying, Gong Runlin, Liu Ronghua, Peng Fenghua, Zhao Gaicun, Song Xianhua, Chai Jinlian, You Runying, and Liang Yueying. With the active support of the county party committee and the county women's federation, they disregarded compensation, feared no hardship, and through two years of hard work and dedication, overcame countless material difficulties and built a coal-to-oil plant with an annual output of 53 tons from scratch. This year, the oil refinery's output will reach 350 tons. To commend their lofty communist style, the Jinbei Prefectural Committee of the CPC and the Jinbei Administrative Office awarded them a banner inscribed with "Wang Guofan on the Industrial Front" at the regional industrial front heroes' conference in February of this year.

    Fifty-Four Procedures Reduced by Half
    Xiao Dexun, a young leather worker and Communist Party member at the Tianjin Jinan Leather Factory, painstakingly studied and, after more than 200 experiments, created a new set of streamlined leather production processes, reducing the 54 procedures of the old process by half. The factory's light leather workshop has carried out a technical revolution based on the new process created by Xiao Dexun, completely eliminating heavy manual labor, increasing daily output by one-third, and shortening the production cycle from 14 days to two and a half days. The Ministry of Light Industry attaches great importance to this initiative and plans to promote this experience nationwide.

    Four Million People Eliminate the Four Pests and Promote Hygiene
    The campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene in Gansu Province has initially begun in various places. The characteristics are: the first secretary of the Party committee takes the lead; action is rapid. In late March, the Party committees of various regions (prefectures, cities) and counties, and the people's commune Party committees actively deployed the patriotic health campaign, and held various meetings to mobilize the people. According to incomplete statistics from Lanzhou, Dingxi, Zhangye and other places, nearly four million people have been involved in the campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene.

    Establishing Three Lines of Defense to Strive for a Great Agricultural Harvest
    The 300,000 people of Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, have proposed establishing three lines of defense to achieve a great harvest even in the face of drought, and to surpass contract output even in the face of difficulties.

    The first line of defense, based on the characteristics of this year's drought, is to establish 210,000 mu of high-yield demonstration plots for rice, 80,000 mu for corn, and 30,000 mu for sweet potatoes in areas where water conservancy projects have already been built; this part of the land alone can produce more than 400 million jin of grain, exceeding the county's planned total grain output. The second line of defense is to make all preparations, and as soon as it rains, to rush to plant 170,000 mu of farmland. The third line of defense is for the entire county to rush to reclaim another 200,000 mu of wasteland and increase the planting of late autumn crops such as sweet potatoes.

    Spring Harvest Crops Must Achieve High Yields and Be Fully Harvested
    The Hunan Provincial Party Committee recently instructed all localities to take various measures to ensure high yields and full harvests of spring harvest crops (wheat, rapeseed, etc.). The instruction said: This year, the area of ​​spring harvest crops in Hunan Province is large, the growth is good, and a bumper harvest is in sight. Everyone must take the same effort in grasping spring harvest crops as they do in grasping rice, so as to achieve a bumper harvest and ensure that all grains are brought into the granary; change people's habit of rough harvesting, and break the superstitious idea of ​​the "low yield theory" of spring harvest crops. This not only has realistic political and economic significance, but also lays an ideological and material foundation for expanding spring harvest crops and striving for a greater harvest next year.

    要闻快报
    “工业战线上的王国藩”
    山西宁武县出现了九位英雄的妇女。她们是：聂素英、宫润林、刘荣华、彭凤花、赵改存、宋先花、柴金莲、尤润英、梁月英。在县委和县妇联的积极支持下，她们不计报酬，不畏艰险，经过两年来穷干苦干，大干特干，战胜了物质上难以数计的困难，白手建起了一座年产五十三吨的煤炼油厂。今年这个炼油厂的产量将达到三百五十吨。中共晋北地委和晋北专署，为了表彰她们这种崇高的共产主义风格，在今年2月份召开的全区工业战线群英大会上，把一面题着“工业战线上的王国藩”的锦旗奖给了她们。
    五十四道工序减去了一半
    天津市津南制革厂青年制革工人、共产党员萧德训刻苦钻研，经过二百多次试验，创制成一套崭新的轻革生产工艺规程，把旧工艺规程的五十四道工序减去一半。这个工厂的轻革车间已按萧德训创制的新工艺规程进行了技术革命，全面消灭了笨重的手工劳动，日产量增加三分之一，生产周期由十四天缩短到两天半。轻工业部十分重视这个创举，准备在全国推广这个经验。
    四百万人除四害讲卫生
    甘肃省除四害讲卫生运动已在各地初步展开。特点是：党委第一书记挂帅；行动迅速。各地（州、市）委、县委和人民公社党委在3月下旬积极部署爱国卫生运动，分别召开了各种会议进行动员。据兰州、定西、张掖等地的不完全统计，目前已有近四百万人投入了除四害、讲卫生运动。
    设下三道防线争取农业大丰收
    云南省宜良县三十万人民提出建立三道防线，做到越干旱越要争取大丰收，越困难越要实现超包产。
    头道防线是根据今年干旱的特点，在已经兴修了水利的地方，建立了二十一万亩水稻、八万亩包谷、三万亩红薯高额丰产片；单是这部分田地就能产粮四亿多斤，超过全县粮食的计划总产量。第二道防线是做好一切准备，一下雨，就突击抢种十七万亩农田。第三道防线是全县再突击开荒二十万亩，增种红薯等晚秋作物。
    春收作物要高产全收
    湖南省委最近指示各地采取各种措施，保证春收作物（小麦、油菜等）高产全收。指示说：今年，湖南省春收作物面积大，生长好，丰收在望，大家一定要拿出抓稻谷一样的劲头来抓好春收作物，做到丰产丰收，颗粒归仓；改变人们粗收的习惯，破除春收作物“低产论”的迷信思想。这样不仅有现实的政治意义和经济意义，同时为明年扩大春收作物，争取更大丰收，打下思想和物质的基础。
