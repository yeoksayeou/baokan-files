Esteemed members of the Presidium:
	We fully endorse the work reports of the three Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin and the Standing Committee. We are determined to work diligently in our respective posts and strive to realize the grand tasks outlined in the reports.
	Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our country has undergone earth-shaking changes in its political and economic landscape in just ten short years, especially after the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, and the establishment and consolidation of the People's Communes. As Premier Zhou pointed out in his article "The Great Decade," "The Chinese people have transformed from slaves in a living hell into fearless masters of their own destiny." Without a doubt, under the glorious guidance of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, our country will continue to experience even more inspiring changes in the coming decade. We will stand tall in the world as a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, fundamentally shaking off the backwardness of being "poor and blank." The people of the whole country are filled with excitement and are cheering for the great victories our motherland has achieved, and fighting to welcome a more beautiful future! Encouraged by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan, like the people of the whole country, are enthusiastically carrying out a labor emulation campaign centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, learning from, comparing with, catching up with, and helping each other, wave after wave pushing the movement to increase production and practice economy to a new peak. The songs of leaping forward with a "good start, a complete success, and a red all the way" resound throughout the border region, and new good news is reported every day.
	Under the leadership and education of the Party, driven by the great situation, and helped and influenced by the working people, industrialists and businessmen in our province have also undergone great changes in their political thinking through the socialist revolution in the economic field, the rectification campaign against rightist elements, and the practice of participating in the Great Leap Forward in production. Most people have changed from constantly thinking about capitalism to being able to start serving socialism and actively participating in the movement to increase production and practice economy. Many industrialists and businessmen have made achievements in this movement, and some have made relatively significant achievements. For example, the fourteen private partners of the Kunming Joint Public-Private Pharmaceutical Factory, with the encouragement of the enterprise's Party committee and the help of the workers, produced eight new products and new tools and wrote four relatively complete sets of operating experience for Yunnan Baiyao and Bai Baodan, etc., during the production upsurge to welcome the National Day in August and September of last year alone. In January and February of this year, they produced another eight new production tools. Some of the private partners of the Kunming Tractor Factory have proposed to guarantee the completion of 150 technical innovations this year, eleven of which have been decided to be completed before the "May Day" holiday as a gift to the Party. Some private partners completed six innovations in January and February of this year. The private partners of the Gejiu Construction Tin Mine achieved twenty technical innovations last year, including the "three-stage trough" successfully developed by Li Bayi, which can increase production and save five tons of refined tin for the country each year, and save 3,060 workdays. All the private partners of the factory have proposed to increase production and save 3,000 taels of gold for the country this year. More than 90% of the family members of industrialists and businessmen in our province have also begun to step out of their homes and participate in various production work and social welfare undertakings organized by enterprises and streets. For example, under the leadership of the Panlong District Committee of Kunming City and the assistance of the Women's Federation and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the families of the industrial and commercial sectors of the Panlong District organized a daily-use hardware repair factory on September 1, 1959. By the end of the year, the number of people developed to nine, and there were seventeen in February this year. When they first entered the factory, they not only knew nothing about technology, but they were also not accustomed to even light labor. However, while learning and doing, they gradually learned bicycle repair, car lock processing, nut screwing, forging welding, and other technologies. In terms of output value, the initial monthly target assigned by the commune was 1,000 yuan, but only 360 yuan was completed. After the factory carried out a red flag competition, established pacesetters, and mobilized everyone to use their brains to find solutions, put forward rationalization proposals, and carried out a study of the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on learning from, comparing with, catching up with, and helping each other, the output value increased month by month, reaching 14,000 yuan by the end of the year. In February of this year, it reached 22,000 yuan, and the tasks were completed ahead of schedule and exceeded every month. There have also been good performances in technical innovation. For example, the efficiency of car lock drilling has increased three times through technical innovation. For example, screwing nuts, at the beginning, it was difficult to screw two-and-a-half-point nuts, but after training, they gradually were able to screw four-point, five-point, and six-point nuts. After studying technology and working cleverly, the number of workers was reduced from two people in three processes to one person in one process and two people in two processes, increasing efficiency by one to two times. Adhering to the spirit of diligence and frugality in running all enterprises, they made the enterprise grow from nothing, from small to large, and played a certain role in serving the market and serving large enterprises and factories. Thanks to the leadership and education of the Party, the support and help of the workers, and for more than a year, industrialists, businessmen, and their families in various cities and counties of the province, whether in industry, commerce, transportation, service industries, or street production and social welfare undertakings, some people have made relatively good contributions to improving enterprise management, improving service attitudes, improving tools and operating techniques, developing new products, improving product quality, saving raw materials, and using substitutes. The number of people who have been rated as advanced workers or producers has gradually increased. According to statistics from twenty cities and counties, in the third quarter of 1959, in a comparison of 15,479 people, 2,858 were rated as advanced workers (producers), an increase of more than double compared to the first quarter of the same year. Some of them have also been invited to attend the representative meetings of advanced producers, advanced workers, and advanced collectives in the industrial and communications systems or the financial and trade systems at all levels. For example, Kunming City recently convened two mass hero meetings of 2,021 people from the financial and trade systems and the industrial and communications systems, in which 82 private partners were invited to participate. Among these figures, there are many women. The family members of the Panlong District Daily-Use Hardware Repair Factory were rated as advanced workers, producers, and pacesetters in the district, one for each, and the factory was rated as a red flag unit in the district. At present, they are working hard to win the last red flag of the three gongs and drums ringing together - putting technical innovation into practice. Under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels in our province and the help of the Women's Federation, there are many other examples. In the urban people's commune organization with great vitality, the families of industrialists and businessmen not only have been liberated from tedious housework like working women, but also have been trained and transformed in actual work, becoming a force in the socialist construction cause.
	Regarding the acceptance of the Party's leadership, most people, on the basis of recognizing that "the Communist Party cannot be opposed," have further moved closer to the Party. Generally, they can actively respond to the Party's call, obey allocation, implement instructions, and strive to complete the tasks assigned by the Party. The psychological apprehension and wariness are gradually decreasing, and the number of people who take the initiative to confide in the Party and strive for the Party's education and help is gradually increasing. Most of us have gradually understood from our own personal experience that resolutely obeying the Party's leadership is the guarantee for the victory of all our work; leaving the Party's leadership will lead to nothing and will cause errors. Only by firmly relying on the Party, obeying the Party's leadership, and listening to the Party's words can our industrialists and businessmen have a bright future. Many people have also greatly changed their confused thoughts and wrong attitudes toward the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune after more than a year of practice and studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Because the Party committees at all levels, especially the enterprise Party committees, have shown infinite care, support, and help to our industrialists and businessmen in their work, study, and life, many people are determined to strengthen self-transformation in the practical work of serving socialism in the future and strive to make more achievements to repay the Party with a grateful heart. These changes in the industrialists and businessmen in our province mark the great victory of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction in the cause of socialist transformation and the great victory of the Party's policy of peaceful transformation of the bourgeoisie.
	However, this progress of our industrial and commercial circles is only compared with the situation more than a year ago, and it is only a big step forward on the road of transformation from exploiters to laborers. There is still a great distance to go to complete the fundamental transformation. Because we have experienced a long period of capitalist practice in the past, the bourgeois worldview, bourgeois stand, thoughts, feelings, and habits are deeply rooted and have not been fundamentally transformed, and the negative side still exists. The main manifestations are that most people still have varying degrees of suspicion and wariness towards the Party's leadership, observe the expressions of others in everything, and are obsequious, and have not truly achieved wholeheartedness. There are still varying degrees of concerns and hesitations about the "Three Banners," and some people even resist and are dissatisfied. In their work, some people lack enthusiasm, fear difficulties, fear responsibility, and fear participating in physical labor. Some still long for capitalism, and a few even demand to withdraw from joint ventures and cooperatives to engage in speculative trading. Many people are not so convinced about learning from the working class, holding narrow technical views and class prejudices, comparing strengths and weaknesses, and are unwilling to humbly seek advice. More people put service and transformation in opposition, only willing to work, not paying attention to the transformation of political thought, afraid of learning, afraid of talking about thoughts, afraid of mentioning "private partners," afraid of mass movements, and afraid of criticism and self-criticism. Some family members still think that they are accompanying their spouses in transformation. The existence of these negative factors is a serious obstacle to the further play of the active role of our industrialists and businessmen and their families. At present, our country is in a new historical period of continued deepening of the socialist revolution and a great leap forward in socialist construction. If we do not continue to strengthen self-transformation, strive to overcome these negative factors, and completely change the bourgeois stand and worldview, then it will make the class contradiction between us industrialists and businessmen and the working class, the working people, and socialism not be correctly resolved, and over time, there will be a danger of problems piling up and contradictions intensifying.
	Recently the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly held a national congress. During the meeting, the leading heads of the Party Central Committee gave us many sincere and insightful teachings, clearly pointing out that the industrial and commercial circles have made great progress, but still need to be transformed. This has greatly enhanced our confidence in continuing to move forward and further clarified the direction of future efforts. What touched us most was Chairman Liu Shaoqi's instructions to the standing chairman after receiving all the representatives of the two conferences: We must ask the industrial and commercial circles to make up their minds, take one side, lean to one side, listen wholeheartedly to Chairman Mao's words, follow the Communist Party, serve the people wholeheartedly, and resolutely lean to the side of socialism. Listening to these instructions made us feel both ashamed and excited. Ashamed because: The Party's policy of peaceful transformation has always been very clear. As long as we accept the transformation, listen to the Party's words wholeheartedly, and actively serve socialism, we will receive meticulous care and attention in our work, study, and life. Our problems and difficulties have always been taken care of by the Party. But many of us are always uneasy, still vacillating, fearing this and fearing that, and half-hearted towards the Party. For ten years, the Party and the people have given our industrialists and businessmen endless political and economic care, but how much effort have we actually put into serving the people? The pace of transformation is so slow that it is already very disproportionate. However, we usually do not think about these things, but instead of thinking about how to actively serve and strengthen transformation, take one side, lean to one side, and wholeheartedly do things for the country and the people, so that we can be worthy of the Party and the people; we calculate personal gains and losses, consider this and consider that, and are timid. This is the concrete reflection of our bourgeois worldview and bourgeois individualism. What excites us is: While the Party and the government reiterate the Party's policy of peaceful transformation to the end in order to reassure our industrialists and businessmen to work, study, and accept transformation with peace of mind, they earnestly teach us: We must rush to the side of service and transformation, we must resolutely lean to the side of socialism, do not be half-hearted; we must strive to transform the bourgeois worldview, understand the laws of social development, and have ideological preparation subjectively, so that when we encounter major events in the objective world, we will not feel sudden and will be happy. These instructions have given our industrialists and businessmen endless strength, and this is the direction of our eternal efforts. In the future, we must turn the Party's teachings into actions and strive to achieve the following points:
	(1) We must firmly rely on the Party, tell the Party the truth, and follow the Party wholeheartedly. The Party is the core that leads all our undertakings. Without the Party's leadership, there would be no New China, and there would be nothing for the people today. If we industrialists and businessmen want to move from an exploiter to the opposite of our class and become glorious workers, we must faithfully accept the Party's leadership and education. This is the fundamental of the fundamentals, the core of the core. The personal experience of ten years on the road of transformation is: the Party cannot be separated from, the Party cannot be doubted, and the Party's leadership cannot be faked. Only by firmly relying on the Party can we make progress, make achievements in our work, and have a bright future.
	(2) We must resolutely support the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and love socialism. The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, these three magic weapons are the invincible weapons for the people of our country to carry out economic revolution, political revolution, and ideological revolution. They are three red flags that reflect the great aspirations of the 650 million people to fundamentally and rapidly get rid of the backwardness of our country's poverty and blankness. In order to accelerate the development of the socialist cause, the broad masses of the working people are currently carrying out a magnificent mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution with the momentum of a bamboo breaking. If we industrialists and businessmen want to truly understand socialism and truly become new socialists, we can only actively participate in the ranks of great production in practical actions, and accept training and education in the great furnace of the revolutionary masses. Only then can we see clearly the great development of industrial and agricultural production and the infinitely bright future of socialism. Thus, we can establish the emotion of loving socialism, strengthen the transformation of our own political stand and thinking, and go all out to contribute all our strength in the high-speed construction of the country together with the working people.
	(3) We must humbly learn from the working people and cultivate the thoughts and feelings of the working people. For more than a year, through the joint labor with the working people, our relationship with the working people has undergone different degrees of change. We have a further understanding of the noble qualities, infinite wisdom, and revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people, and we are increasingly aware that in order to gradually shorten the distance with the working people and transform into glorious working people, we must make up our minds to further study the working people, love the Party, love socialism, and forget ourselves. We must study their noble qualities of wholeheartedly contributing to socialism, not caring about personal gains and losses, going up when we see difficulties, and giving up honors. We industrialists and businessmen must go into the masses as ordinary workers and mingle with the working people, work together, work together, share weal and woe, and only in practice can we learn their communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, establish a labor perspective, improve labor ability, cultivate labor habits, and cultivate thoughts and feelings.
	(4) We must strengthen the study of political theory, understand the laws of social development, and master our own destiny. We industrialists and businessmen must conscientiously study political theory and current affairs policies, and historical materialism, especially study Chairman Mao's works, study using Mao Zedong Thought to correctly observe things, analyze things, handle things, and thoroughly transform our bourgeois worldview, gradually establish a proletarian worldview. From the fundamental transformation of our industrialists and businessmen, practice is the foundation, and politics is the commander, and is the soul that guides all work. Therefore, people in socialist society must understand some great socialist principles and understand the principles that the bourgeoisie is bound to perish and socialism is bound to prosper from a theoretical perspective. Thereby improving consciousness, taking the initiative, being active, being happy, and heading towards socialism wholeheartedly, and striving in this direction forever.
	Completing and overfulfilling my country's 1960 national economic plan is the top priority political task of the people of the whole country. Fighting together with the people of the whole country in every possible way to realize the 1960 national economic plan is the specific yardstick for testing whether we industrialists and businessmen "take one side and lean to one side." We must help each other and encourage each other together with the industrialists and businessmen and all the family members of the entire Yunnan Province, rely closely on the leadership and education of the Party, rely on the help of the working people, constantly improve consciousness, go all out, actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy, resolutely support the urban people's commune, and do our best to complete all the tasks assigned by the Party, and make new contributions in the socialist construction cause. Let us hold high the banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and unswervingly move forward in the direction of "taking one side and leaning to one side."

    工商业者只有坚决靠拢共产党才有光明前途
    王少岩、刘淑清代表　董仁明委员谈云南省工商业者的变化主席团各位代表：
    我们完全拥护李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理和常务委员会的工作报告，并坚决在自己的工作岗位上积极努力，为实现报告中所提出的宏伟任务而奋斗。
    我们国家在党和毛主席的领导下，经过短短的十年，特别是经过1958和1959两年的连续大跃进，以及人民公社的建立与巩固，政治面貌和经济面貌都发生了翻天复地的变化，正如周总理在“伟大的十年”这篇文章中所指出的：“中国人民由人间地狱的奴隶一变而为自己命运的大无畏的主人。”毫无疑问，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我们国家在今后十年期间，将继续发生更加振奋人心的变化，我们将以具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大社会主义强国屹立于世界，从根本上摆脱“一穷二白”的落后面貌。全国人民都怀着兴奋沸腾的心情，为我们祖国已经取得的伟大胜利而欢呼，为迎接更加美好的将来而战斗！在党的八届八中全会精神鼓舞之下，我们云南各族人民和全国人民一样，正在热火朝天地开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的学、比、赶、帮的劳动竞赛，一浪追一浪地把增产节约运动推向新的高峰。开门红、满堂红、红到底的跃进歌声，响遍了整个边疆，每天都有新的捷报传来。
    我省工商业者在党的领导教育下，在伟大形势的推动下，在劳动人民的帮助和影响下，经过经济上的社会主义革命、整风反右运动和参加生产大跃进的实践，政治思想也发生了很大变化。大多数人从念念不忘资本主义，转变到能开始为社会主义服务，积极投入了增产节约运动。不少的工商业者，在这一运动中都做出了成绩，一部分人做出了比较显著的成绩。如昆明市公私合营联合制药厂私方十四人，在企业党委的鼓励和工人的帮助下，仅在去年大战8、9月，迎接国庆节的生产高潮中，即试制出新产品、新工具八项，写出比较完整的云南白药和百宝丹等操作经验四套。今年1、2月内，又试制出新的生产工具八项。昆明拖拉机厂的私方人员，有的提出保证要在今年内实现技术革新一百五十件，其中有十一件决定在“五一”节前完成，向党献礼。有的私方在今年1、2月内，即完成了六件革新。箇旧市建设锡矿的私方人员，去年实现了技术革新二十件，其中李八一试制成功的“三级槽”，每槽每年即可为国家增产节约精锡五吨，并可节约三千零六十个劳动日。该厂全体私方提出要在今年内为国家增产节约黄金三千两。我省90％以上的工商业者家属，也开始走出了家门，参加到企业和街道所组织的各种生产工作和社会福利事业。如昆明市盘龙区工商界家属在区委的领导和妇联、工商联的帮助下，1959年9月1日由三个家属组织了日用五金修配厂，到年底人数发展为九人，今年2月即有十七人，她们初进厂时不仅完全不懂技术，连轻微的劳动也不习惯，但在边学边作的情况下，逐渐学会单车修配，汽车门锁加工，搬螺丝，锻焊工等技术。在产值方面，公社第一个月的下达指标为一千元，但仅完成三百六十元，经过厂里开展红旗竞赛，树立标兵，发动大家动脑筋想办法，提出合理化建议，开展了学、比、赶、帮运动为中心的增产节约运动的学习，产值逐月上升，到年底完成一万四千元。今年2月达到二万二千元，而且每月都提前和超额完成任务。在技术革新中，也有良好表现，如汽车门锁打眼经过技术革新，工效提高三倍，如搬螺丝，开始时搬二分半螺丝也感吃力，经过锻炼逐渐能搬四分、五分、六分的螺丝。在钻研技术和巧干之后由二人三道工序减为一人一道工序和二人二道工序，提高效率一至二倍。她们本着勤俭办一切企业的精神，因陋就简地使企业由无到有，由小到大，在为市场服务，为大企业厂矿服务方面起了一定的作用。由于党的领导和教育，由于工人群众的支持和帮助，一年多来全省各市县工商业者和家属无论在工业、商业、交通运输和服务行业以及街道生产工作社会福利事业，对于改进企业经营管理，改善服务态度，改良工具和操作技术，试制新产品，提高产品质量，节约原材料，利用代用品等等方面，都有一些人作出了比较良好的贡献。被评为先进工作者或生产者的人数逐渐增多，根据二十个市县材料统计，1959年第三季度评比，在一万五千四百七十九人当中有二千八百五十八人被评为先进工作者（生产者），比之同年第一季度增加了一倍多。其中一部分人还被邀出席了各级工交系统或财贸系统的先进生产者、先进工作者和先进集体的代表会议。如昆明市最近先后召开了财贸系统和工交系统共二千零二十一人的群英会，其中即有私方人员八十二人被邀参加。在这数字当中有不少是妇女。盘龙区日用五金修配厂的家属被评为区的先进工作者、生产者、标兵各一人，该厂评为区的红旗单位。目前她们正在努力夺取三套锣鼓一齐响的最后一面红旗——技术革新上马而奋斗。在我省各级党委领导和妇联的帮助下，还有不少例子。在具有伟大生命力的城市人民公社组织中，工商界家属不仅能同劳动妇女一样已从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，而且使她们在实际工作中得到锻炼改造，成为社会主义建设事业中的一分力量。
    对于接受党的领导方面，多数人在认识了“共产党反不得”的基础上，进一步地靠拢了党，一般能够积极响应党的号召，服从调配，执行指示，努力完成党所交给的任务，疑虑戒备心理逐渐在减少，主动向党交心，争取党的教育和帮助的人，逐渐在增多。我们当中多数人从自己的切身体验中逐渐懂得了坚决服从党的领导是我们一切工作取得胜利的保证；离开党的领导，就会一事无成，错误百出。只有坚决靠拢党，服从党的领导，听党的话，才有我们工商业者的光明前途。许多人对于总路线、大跃进、人民公社的一些糊涂思想和错误态度，经过一年多来的实践和党的八届八中全会文件的学习，也有很大转变。由于各级党委，首先是企业党委在工作上、学习上、生活上，对我们工商业者无限的关怀、支持和帮助，不少人怀着感恩图报的心情，决心要在今后为社会主义服务的工作实践中加强自我改造，努力做出更多成绩来报答党。我省工商业者的这些变化，标志着党的社会主义建设总路线在社会主义改造事业方面的伟大胜利，党对资产阶级和平改造政策的伟大胜利。
    但是我们工商界的这种进步，只是和一年多前的情况相比较，只是从剥削者转变成为劳动者的改造道路上跨进了一大步，对于完成根本改造，还有很大距离。由于我们过去经历了长时间的资本主义的实践，资产阶级的世界观，资产阶级的立场、思想、感情、习惯根深蒂固，没有获得根本改造，消极一面依然存在。主要表现在多数人对于党的领导还有不同程度的怀疑戒备、遇事察颜观色，唯唯诺诺，没有真正做到一心一意。对于三个万岁，还有不同程度的顾虑、动摇，有些人甚至抵触不满。在工作中，有些人干劲不足，怕困难，怕负责，怕参加体力劳动。有的还留恋资本主义，个别的甚至要求退出合营和合作社，搞投机买卖。不少人对于向工人阶级学习还不那么心服，抱着狭隘的技术观点和阶级偏见，比长论短，不愿虚心求教。更多的人把服务和改造对立起来，只愿干活，不重视政治思想的改造，怕学习，怕谈思想，怕提“私方”，怕群众运动，怕批评与自我批评。有的家属还认为是陪爱人改造。这些消极因素的存在，是我们工商业者和家属不能够进一步发挥积极作用的严重障碍。目前我国正处在社会主义革命继续深入和社会主义建设大跃进的新的历史时期，如果我们不继续加强自我改造，努力克服这些消极因素，彻底改变资产阶级的立场和世界观，那就将使我们工商业者同工人阶级、同劳动人民、同社会主义的阶级矛盾得不到正确解决，日积月累，就会有问题成堆矛盾尖锐化的危险。
    最近民建中央和全国工商联联合举行了全国代表大会，会议期间，党中央的领导首长给了我们许多恳切而透辟的教导，明确指出工商界大有进步，但还要改造。极大地增强了我们继续前进的信心，并进一步明确了今后努力的方向。最使我们感动的是刘少奇主席在接见两会全体代表之后，对常务主席所作的指示：要我们工商界下决心，顾一头，一边倒，一心一意听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，一心一意为人民服务，坚决倒向社会主义这一边。听了这些指示，使我们感到又惭愧，又激动。惭愧的是：党的和平改造政策，本来早就很明确，只要我们接受改造，一心一意听党的话，积极为社会主义服务，工作、学习、生活都得到无微不至的关怀和照顾，我们的问题和困难，一贯都是党包了的。但是我们中的许多人总是不放心，随时还在七上八下，怕这怕那，对党三心二意。十年来，党和人民给我们工商业者政治上、经济上的照顾是说不完的，而我们究竟为人民出过多大点力？改造的步伐又这样慢，已经很不相称。但是，我们平日总不去想这些，不是去想如何积极服务，加强改造，顾一头，一边倒，一心一意为国家为人民做事，使自己对得起党，对得起人民；而是盘算个人利害得失，顾这顾那，畏首畏尾。这就是我们资产阶级世界观和资产阶级个人主义的具体反映。我们感到激动的是：党和政府为了我们工商业者安心工作，安心学习，安心接受改造，重申了党的包到底的和平改造政策的同时，谆谆教导我们：要奔服务和改造的这一头，要坚决倒向社会主义这一边，不要三心二意；要努力改造资产阶级世界观，认识社会发展规律，主观上有了思想准备，遇到客观世界的重大事变，才不会感到突然，才会心情愉快。这些指示，给了我们工商业者无穷无尽的力量，这是我们永远努力的方向。我们今后一定把党的教导变为行动，努力做到下列各点：
      （一）要坚决靠拢党，向党说真心话，死心踏地的跟着党走。党是领导我们一切事业的核心，没有党的领导，就没有新中国，也没有今天人民的一切。我们工商业者要从一个剥削者走上自己阶级的反面，成为光荣的动劳人民，就必须忠诚接受党的领导和教育，这是根本的根本，核心的核心。十年来在改造道途中的切身体会：党是离不得的，党是疑不得的，对党的领导是假不得的。只有坚决依靠党才能进步，才能在工作上做出成绩，才能有光明的前途。
    （二）要坚决拥护总路线、大跃进、人民公社，热爱社会主义。总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这三大法宝是我国人民进行经济革命政治革命、思想革命的无往而不胜的武器，是反映六亿五千万人民要求从根本上迅速摆脱我国一穷二白落后面貌伟大志愿的三面红旗，为了加快社会主义事业的发展，目前广大劳动人民正以破竹之势开展着波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，我们工商业者要真正认识社会主义，真正作到社会主义的新人，就只有以实际行动积极投入大生产劳动行列中去，在革命群众的伟大熔炉中接受锻炼和教育，才能看清工农业生产的大发展，社会主义无限美好的前途。从而树立热爱社会主义的感情，加强自身政治立场和思想的改造，鼓足干劲与劳动人民一起，在国家高速度建设中贡献自己的一切力量。
    （三）要虚心向劳动人民学习，培养劳动人民的思想感情，一年多来通过和劳动人民的共同劳动，我们和劳动人民的关系已经有不同程度的变化，对劳动人民的高贵品质，无穷无尽的智慧和革命的干劲有进一步的体会，越来越认识到要逐步与劳动人民缩短距离，转化为光荣的劳动人民，今后就必须下定决心进一步学习劳动人民，热爱党、热爱社会主义，忘我创造的精神，学习他们一心一意只顾为社会主义贡献力量，不计较个人得失，见困难就上见荣誉就让的高贵品质。我们工商业者必须以普通劳动者的身分投入群众中去与劳动人民打成一片，同劳动，同工作，同甘共苦，在实践中才能学习他们敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，树立劳动观点、提高劳动能力，培养劳动习惯，和思想感情。
      （四）要加强政治理论学习，认识社会发展规律，掌握自己命运。我们工商业者，必须认真学习政治理论和时事政策，和历史唯物主义，特别要学习毛主席著作，学习以毛泽东思想来正确观察事物，分析事物，处理事物，来彻底改造我们的资产阶级世界观，逐步树立无产阶级世界观，从我们工商业者的根本改造来说，实践是基础，政治是统帅，是指导一切工作的灵魂，因此，社会主义社会的人，就必须懂得一些社会主义大道理，从理论上来认识资产阶级必然灭亡，社会主义必然昌盛的道理，从而提高自觉，主动积极地、心情愉快地、一心一意朝社会主义奔，永远向这个方向努力。
    完成和超额完成我国1960年的国民经济计划，这是当前全国人民头等重要的政治任务。和全国人民在一起千方百计为实现1960年的国民经济计划而斗争，这是检验我们工商业者“顾一头，一边倒”的具体标尺。我们一定要和云南全省工商业者和全体家属互助互勉，紧紧依靠党的领导和教育，依靠劳动人民的帮助，不断提高自觉，鼓足干劲，积极投入增产节约运动，坚决拥护城市人民公社，竭尽一切心力，努力完成党所交给的一切任务，在社会主义建设事业中做出新的贡献。让我们更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的旗帜，坚定不渝地朝着“顾一头，一边倒”的方向奋勇前进。
