Xinhua News Agency report: A massive technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is vigorously unfolding in textile enterprises across the country. According to statistics from fifteen provinces and cities, including Shanghai, a total of 2.45 million innovation proposals were put forward in the first quarter.

The main targets of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement are heavy physical labor and manual operations that employ a large number of people. Many regions have successfully tested automatic tearing and laying of cotton, automatic doffing, automatic and semi-automatic spinning, automatic bobbin shifting, and automatic and semi-automatic warp tying machines. In a short period, more than one million spindles in Shanghai have implemented semi-automatic doffing, replacing the heavy operation of manually pulling and inserting by hand that had been used for decades. Numerous small enterprises with outdated equipment and a low degree of mechanization, such as those producing gloves, socks, dyeing and printing, and silk weaving, are rapidly getting rid of manual operations, and even entire industries are experiencing a transformation. Two to three hundred thousand textile workers across the country have been liberated from heavy physical labor and tedious manual operations.

While achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization, various textile enterprises are further advancing towards automation, semi-automation, and continuous production. Shanghai already has 330 production lines and 96 automatic or semi-automatic production lines; five printing and dyeing factories in Tianjin have full continuous automatic production lines.

Expanding raw material sources and conserving and finding substitute raw materials are also an important aspect of this movement. The Qingdao Wild Fiber Utilization Factory uses flax and wisteria bark fiber blended with cotton yarn; Sichuan uses coir grass to weave labor protection cloth and packaging cloth; the Hebei Chengde Sack Factory created a new type of cotton stalk bark degumming method to produce sacks, greatly saving caustic soda and labor, and improving raw material utilization. These have opened up new avenues for the textile industry to expand raw material resources.

During the movement, various regions also actively trial-produced and produced new products. In the first quarter alone, nearly 10,000 types were successfully trial-produced in five provinces and cities, including Shanghai, Beijing, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Liaoning. Significant progress has also been made in tackling cutting-edge technologies, accelerating the process of China's textile industry climbing to the peak of world science and technology.

### 减轻体力劳动　扩大原料来源　提高原料利用率  纺织工人造新机具创新技术

    减轻体力劳动　扩大原料来源　提高原料利用率
    纺织工人造新机具创新技术
    据新华社讯　声势浩大的以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在全国各个纺织企业中蓬勃展开。据上海等十五个省、市的统计，第一季度共提出革新建议二百四十五万条。
    技术革新和技术革命运动的主要矛头是指向笨重的体力劳动和占人数较多的手工操作工种。许多地区已经试验成功了自动撕花铺棉、自动落卷、自动和半自动落纱、自动摆管、自动和半自动穿经等机械。短短期间上海就有一百多万纱绽推行了半自动落纱，代替了几十年来一手拔一手插的繁重操作。为数众多的设备落后、机械化程度很低的小型企业，如织手套袜子、印染和织绸等企业都在迅速地摆脱手工操作，甚至出现了全行业翻身的景象。全国有二、三十万纺织工人从笨重体力劳动和繁琐的手工操作中解放出来。
    各个纺织企业在实现机械化半机械化的同时，更进一步向自动化、半自动化和连续化进军。上海已经有生产流水线三百三十条，自动或半自动生产线九十六条；天津有五个印染厂出现了全程连续自动生产线。
    扩大原料来源、节约和寻找代用原材料，也是这次运动的一个重要方面。青岛野生纤维利用工厂用胡麻和藤胶皮纤维混纺棉纱；四川用蓑草织出劳动保护用布和包装用布；河北承德麻袋厂创造了新型的棉秆皮脱胶法，来生产麻袋，大大节约了烧碱和劳动力，提高了原料利用率。这些都为纺织工业扩大原料资源开辟了新的途径。
    运动中，各地还积极试制和生产新产品。单是上海、北京、河北、江苏、辽宁等五个省市，第一季度就试制成功了近一万种。在攻取尖端技术方面，也有很大进展，加速了我国纺织工业攀登世界科学技术高峰的进程。
