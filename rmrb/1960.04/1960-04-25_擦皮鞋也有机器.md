There are also machines for shining shoes
Shining shoes relies entirely on a brush and two hands, and one person can only shine one shoe at a time. It seems like light work, but shining a pair of shoes occupies one unit of labor, taking fifteen minutes. Wouldn't it be great if there was a machine! The workers of the shoe-shining team at the Dexingli Life Service Station in Qixinggang, Chongqing, have successfully created a semi-mechanized shoe-shining machine using local methods. It combines five processes into one, including brushing off dust, removing mud, applying polish, brushing, and buffing. Workers can sit on high stools and operate the machine, quickly shining leather shoes until they are bright and shiny, increasing work efficiency twofold.

    擦皮鞋也有机器
    擦皮鞋，全靠一把刷子两只手，而且一个人一次只能擦一只。看起来活轻，可是擦一双鞋就要占一个劳动力，花十五分钟，要是有机器这该多好啊！重庆市七星岗德兴里生活服务站擦鞋小组的工人们，用土办法制成功一部半机械化的擦鞋机，把刷灰、去泥、上油、刷光、出光等五道工序连成一气，工人坐在高凳上操作机器，就可以很快地把皮鞋擦得又光又亮，提高工效两倍。
