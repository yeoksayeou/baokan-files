Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: The iron and steel workers of Henan Province are vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, promoting a high-speed and comprehensive leap forward in production. In the first quarter of this year, the province's output of steel, iron, and steel products increased by 2500%, 25%, and 1800% respectively compared to the same period last year; compared to the fourth quarter of last year, they increased by 47%, 12%, and 68% respectively. The average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces increased from 0.943 in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.074 in the first quarter of this year, reaching 1.1 in March; the qualified rate of pig iron increased from 69.62% in the same period last year to 79%; the utilization coefficient of converters increased from 5.43 in January to 8.5 in March; the coke ratio for iron smelting and the cost per ton of iron also decreased significantly.

A new atmosphere of "innovation flowers bloom for thousands of miles, blast furnaces everywhere are renewed" has appeared on the iron and steel front in Henan Province. More than 40,000 iron and steel workers across the province have now been freed from heavy physical labor. The No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant in Xinxiang City has achieved mechanization of crushing, automation of raw coal washing, mechanization of mineral powder washing and sintering, track transportation, automation of coke transportation, and automation of blast furnace tapping, greatly improving labor productivity and saving more than 1,000 laborers. The Pingdingshan Coking Plant created a coke pulling rod, which not only increased work efficiency tenfold, but also freed workers from high-temperature operations; now, more than 50% of coke ovens in the province have applied this experience. Many units are also advancing further towards automation and semi-automation with the spirit of continuous revolution. Currently, there are four semi-automatic lines and linkage lines.

As a result of vigorously carrying out technical innovation, the number of new products in Henan's iron and steel industry has also greatly increased. At the end of last year, only six types could be produced, but in the first quarter of this year, the number has increased to more than 50, including silicon steel, welding rod steel, seamless steel pipes, flat steel, thin plates, and various specifications of wire.

In the technical transformation centered on small blast furnaces, various factories and mining enterprises have conscientiously implemented the principles of relying mainly on self-reliance, closely integrating with production, using both foreign and indigenous methods, and combining technical transformation with maintenance. In the first quarter of this year, 1,200 cubic meters of blast furnace transformation and 15 tons of converter transformation have been completed in the province. The transformed small blast furnaces have radiated extraordinary brilliance, demonstrating the pioneering spirit of small blast furnaces and their powerful vitality. The utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the province increased from 1.06 in January to 1.1 in March.

Currently, the technical innovation movement in Henan's iron and steel industry has entered a new stage. The staff and workers on the entire iron and steel front are accelerating the comprehensive technical transformation of mines, coking plants, transportation, blast furnaces, converters, and rolling mills, and are advancing towards the comprehensive realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization.

This newspaper reports: The Bajie Iron Mine of Kunming Iron and Steel Company adheres to putting politics in command, working hard and cleverly, and vigorously carrying out the technical revolution, quickly changing its "poor and blank" appearance. Not long ago, the Yunnan Provincial On-site Conference of Ferrous Metal Mines held at this mine rated this mine, known as the "poor stick mine" of Yunnan Province's metallurgical industry, as a red flag of ferrous metal mines. The province launched the "Learn from Bajie" campaign.

When the Bajie Iron Mine was first built in 1958, it produced only one or two hundred tons of ore per day. In June 1959, after being managed by Kunming Iron and Steel Company, on the one hand, it rectified the original mines, and on the other hand, it adopted the policy of strengthening mine construction through simultaneous exploration, production, and capital construction. Under the conditions of insufficient cadres, inconvenient transportation, and lack of power and mining equipment, the mine's Party committee adhered to putting politics in command, vigorously launched mass movements, and built the mine diligently and thriftily. In less than a year, the mine has developed into a mine of considerable scale and has become a major iron ore base in Yunnan. This year, the mine launched a mass-based technical innovation and technical revolution movement. They focused on the weak link of transportation and vigorously carried out "five-izations": vehicle-ization, track-ization, cableway-ization, chute-ization, and winch-ization. In more than a month, the staff and workers manufactured more than 400 handcarts, built "ore chutes" with a total passing capacity of 3,000 tons, and erected two indigenous cableways and two indigenous winches, basically realizing the "five-izations," increasing loading and unloading efficiency fivefold and saving 300 laborers. They also successfully adopted the experience of large-scale blasting and stripping mining. On March 10, they used "directional throwing" large-scale blasting, once stripping 30,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, equivalent to the production of 4,500 people in one day, making iron ore production increase day by day. The average daily output in early March reached 2,500 tons, an increase of 172% compared with the average daily output in February.

The reason why this mine can achieve such great achievements in a short period of time is mainly because all the staff and workers of the mine have a spirit of continuous revolution, striving for advancement, and bravely overcoming difficulties. In June of last year, this mine was basically still a mine with manual operation and indigenous mining of "big hammer plus small hammer, carrying pole plus dustpan." Employees who were truly familiar with mine work accounted for only 1% of the total number of people. Under such circumstances, the mine's Party organization carried out in-depth and meticulous political and ideological work, enabling the vast number of staff and workers to establish the lofty ambition to overcome all difficulties. Their spirit of "tigers are killed by Wu Song, roads are made by people," "let difficulties bow to me," and "take difficulties as motivation" not only solved the various problems in mine construction, but also ensured that the technical innovation movement quickly achieved significant results.

This is the washing machine and sintering furnace in production.

    技术革命运动使中小企业放出奇光异彩
    河南钢铁产量大幅度上升
    云南八街铁矿日产量猛增一倍多
    据新华社郑州电　河南钢铁工业职工大闹技术革新和技术革命，推动了生产高速度全面跃进。全省今年第一季度钢、铁和钢材的产量，比去年同期分别提高了2500％、25％和1800％；同去年第四季度相比，分别提高47％、12％和68％。高炉平均利用系数由去年第四季度零点九四三提高到今年一季度的一点零七四，3月份已达到一点一；生铁合格率由去年同期的69.62％提高到79％；转炉利用系数由元月份的五点四三，提高到3月份的八点五；炼铁焦比、吨铁成本也有了显著降低。
    河南省钢铁战线到处出现了“革新花开万里香，高炉处处换新装”的新气象。全省钢铁企业中目前已有四万多钢铁工人摆脱了笨重的体力劳动。新乡市第二钢铁厂已实现了破碎机械化，原煤洗选自动化，矿粉洗选烧结机械化，运输轨道化，焦炭运输自动化和高炉堵口自动化，大大提高了劳动生产率，并且节省出一千多劳动力。平顶山焦化厂创造了拉焦杆，不但工作效率提高十倍，而且使工人摆脱了高温操作；现在，全省已有50％以上的焦炉应用了这一经验。不少单位还以不断革命的精神，进一步向自动化半自动化迈进。现在已出现了四条半自动线和联动线。
    大闹技术革新的结果，河南钢铁工业的新产品也大大增多了，去年底只能生产六种，今年第一季度已增加到五十多种；其中有矽钢、焊条钢、无缝钢管、扁钢、薄板和各种规格的线材等。
    在以小高炉为中心的技术改造中，各厂矿企业认真贯彻了自力更生为主，紧密结合生产，能洋就洋，土洋并举，以及技术改造与检修相结合的原则。全省第一季度高炉改造已完成一千二百立方米，转炉改造已完成十五个吨位。改造后的小高炉大放异彩，显示了小高炉的首创精神和它强大的生命力。全省小高炉的利用系数由元月份的一点零六提高到3月份的一点一。
    目前，河南钢铁工业的技术革新运动已进入一个新的阶段。整个钢铁战线上的职工，正在加速矿山、焦化、交通运输、高炉、转炉和轧机的全面技术改造，向全面实现机械化、半机械化进军。
    本报讯　昆明钢铁公司八街铁矿坚持政治挂帅，苦干巧干，大闹技术革命，迅速改变了“一穷二白”的面貌。不久以前在这个矿召开的云南全省黑色金属矿山现场会，把这个被称为云南省冶金工业的“穷棒子矿”，评为黑色金属矿山的红旗。全省展开了“学八街”的活动。
    八街铁矿在1958年刚建矿时，每天生产的矿石只有一、二百吨。1959年6月，由昆明钢铁公司经营后，一方面整顿原有矿山，一方面采取边勘探、边生产、边基建的方针加强矿山建设。在干部不足、交通不便、没有动力及采矿设备的情况下，这个矿的党委坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，勤俭建矿。不到一年，这个矿便发展成为一个具有相当规模的矿山，成了目前云南主要的铁矿基地。今年，这个矿开展了群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动。他们针对运输这一薄弱环节大搞“五化”：车子化、轨道化、索道化、溜槽化、卷扬化。一个多月的时间，职工们就制造了四百多辆手推车，修建了总通过能力为三千吨的“矿石溜矿槽”，架起了两条土索道、两架土卷扬机，基本上实现了“五化”，装卸效率提高了五倍，节约了三百个劳动力。他们还成功地采用了大爆破剥离采矿的经验。3月10日，他们采用“定向抛掷”大爆破，一次就剥去土石方三万立方米，等于四千五百个人一天的生产量，使铁矿石产量与日俱增。3月上旬的平均日产量就达到二千五百吨，比2月份的平均日产量增长了172％。
    这座矿山所以能在一个短时间内取得这样巨大的成绩，主要是因为全矿职工有一股不断革命，力争上游，勇于战胜困难的劲头。去年6月，这座矿山基本上还是一个
  “大锤加小锤，扁担加簸箕”的手工操作、土法开采的矿山。真正熟悉矿山工作的职工，只占总人数的1％。在这种情况下，矿山党组织进行了深入细致的政治思想工作，使广大职工树立了克服一切困难的雄心大志。他们说：“老虎是武松打的，路是人走出来的”，“让困难向我低头”，“把困难作为动力”的精神，既解决了矿山建设中的种种难题，也保证了技术革新运动迅速取得重大成果。（附图片）
