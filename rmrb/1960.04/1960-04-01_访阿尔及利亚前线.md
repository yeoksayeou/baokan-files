    Visiting the Algerian Front Line
    Wang Wei
    "Sixty miles from here, a war is being waged. This war is imposed on a nation that has taken up arms for five years for independence and national survival. On the other side of the border, in a thirty-kilometer-wide zone, along the entire border line, is a fortress, a 'no man's land,' which French military terminology calls 'shattered land.' Because everything has been destroyed there. There are two lines of defense - the 'Morice Line' and the 'Challe Line', named after those who set them up. Each line of defense has six layers of electric fence, through which current passes, separating Algeria and Tunisia from north to south. French colonialists are still pursuing their arrogant colonialist daydream of 're-occupation' there. The army of French colonialists armed to the teeth, with the support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is 'mopping up' the Algerian National Liberation Army, but General Challe has seen with his own eyes for a year that the areas he thought had been destroyed have reappeared there with our army. Three thousand Algerian soldiers equipped only with rifles in 1954 have now grown into 130,000 young Algerian regular troops with new weapons.”
    This was the powerful statement made by Boumaza, the representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front, on the platform of the Second All-African People's Conference not long ago. His voice received a unanimous response. The representatives of various African countries gathered in the conference hall in Tunis praised the Algerian struggle as the forefront of the African national independence movement.
    While Boumaza's voice was still echoing in our ears, after completing our coverage of the Second All-African People's Conference, we had the opportunity to visit the Algerian front line and see with our own eyes a corner of the most advanced outpost of the Algerian battle.
    The car was traveling on a mountain road. The positions of the French colonial army might be on the other side of the mountain. But our car moved forward without any disguise. The further we went, the denser the forest became. In a mountain pass we passed through, there was a fierce battle last September. More than forty French soldiers died and seven were captured in front of the heroic Algerian soldiers. A French plane was destroyed. A photo of the wreckage of this plane is still hanging in the camp headquarters. Although the French government brags about its "battle achievements" every day, right here, the Algerian army's defense line has not moved backward, but has advanced greatly. The scene before us could not help but remind me of a popular war song during the Anti-Japanese War: "In the dense forest, campsites for our comrades are arranged everywhere. On the high hills, we have countless good brothers..."
    After passing through a not-too-long forest road, our car stopped at a camp headquarters on the border front line. We were warmly received in this simple and unadorned camp headquarters. On the wall of the headquarters hung a photo of a young girl, with a sweet smile, but with firm and bright eyes. This is Djamila Bouhired, the Algerian national heroine who is still being tortured in a French prison.
    The young camp commander (as they are called in the Algerian army) told us that this place is not far from the "Morice Line," and even closer to the "Challe Line," only a few kilometers away. He said that it is not difficult for you to see the "Morice Line." As he spoke, he led us out of the camp headquarters. It turned out that in front of the camp headquarters, there was a pile of barbed wire that we had not noticed. This is a large pile of defensive materials that this unit brought down from the "Morice Line": a ball of barbed wire, wrapped around thick iron rods, with conductors on it. This reminded me of a female soldier I met in Morocco a few months ago who had just come out of the Algerian war zone. When I asked her how she left the Algerian war zone and where she passed through the blockade, she said nonchalantly that she came over from the "Morice Line." The French colonial generals attempted to use various "lines of defense" to stop the Algerian National Liberation Army's offensive, but over the past year, heroic Algerian soldiers have broken through the "Morice Line" on a large scale several times. The myth of the "Morice Line" has been shattered. The "Challe Line" has also suffered the same fate.
    The camp commander took a pile of books from the bookshelf, including combat training tutorials for the Algerian army, as well as a booklet called "Guerrilla Tactics." This young officer told us that there are more than a dozen books about China in this unit, and the soldiers are vying to read them, and it has not been his turn yet.
    After a short rest at the camp headquarters, we switched to a jeep to go to a company on the front line. Although it was a cloudy day and the road was a bit muddy, the soldiers here built countless solid roads leading to the border front with tree trunks. It is said that French planes come to harass here every day, but today is the only exception; the French planes did not come. This company lives in a forest, and the enemy's defense line is on the opposite hill.
    The young Algerian soldiers warmly shook hands with us. Their uniforms were neat and their spirits were high. The equipment of the troops is very sophisticated, which is indeed a major change for the Algerian soldiers who only had rifles five years ago.
    We saw the officers and soldiers of the camp headquarters and the company embracing each other enthusiastically. They were so kind and friendly. According to our understanding, the treatment of officers and soldiers in this unit is the same. In addition to sufficient supplies, each person receives a salary of one thousand Tunisian francs per month.
    The camp commander told us that most of the soldiers in this unit are from Bône. He said that on a clear day, standing on the top of the mountain, you can vaguely see the city of Bône - this beautiful Algerian city on the Mediterranean coast. Who doesn't miss their hometown? What's more, the hometown is so close, but Bône is under the occupation of French colonialists, and the soldiers' families are suffering, which further motivates the soldiers' fighting spirit.
    People still remember that last August, tens of thousands of French troops launched an attack on the Kabylie mountains, attempting to eliminate the combat power of the Algerian National Liberation Army in one fell swoop. However, the brave Algerian army unexpectedly hit the suburbs of Bône, making some suspicious Western "diplomats" who went to Bône almost unable to return to Algiers, making these "diplomats" panicked and embarrassed.
    We met an Algerian young soldier, Masou Rahabi, who also grew up in Bône. When he was fourteen or fifteen years old and studying in Bône, he often put bombs in his schoolbag, which caused a lot of trouble for the enemy in Bône. At the age of sixteen (1956), he joined the Algerian National Liberation Army. His two brothers were arrested for participating in underground struggles and are still in the French prisons in Bône.
    The Algerian officers and soldiers all know why they are fighting, and they are full of confidence in the future of the struggle. When we talked with Company Commander Abdul Akday, we found that he was not yet married. He smiled and said to us that for national independence, marriage is a secondary matter. He said that we will definitely be able to eliminate the enemy, and we will definitely achieve freedom, because our cause is just.
    In this forest, looking around, some soldiers are on guard on the top of the mountain, and some are training. On the surface, it seems peaceful and uneventful here, but the soldiers told us that in addition to French planes coming to harass here every day, the enemy often launches surprise attacks to disrupt their positions, but the enemy has never succeeded. The Algerian soldiers often launch surprise attacks on the enemy here, so there are often small-scale battles here, and sometimes battles occur almost every day.
    Following the camp commander's finger, mountains are connected to mountains here, and the forward positions are intertwined.
    We also visited the front-line repair shop, warehouse, and temporary hospital. The soldiers lit branches and firewood in their barracks to keep warm, because although this is North Africa, the forest is full of cold wind. We sat around the firewood with the soldiers to chat and keep warm.
    No matter in the warehouse, in the barracks, or in the repair shop, everything is in order, and the soldiers live a serious and happy military life. On the wall of a temporary hospital, large slogans are written in Arabic: "Fight for Freedom" "Algeria must be free, Algeria will eventually be free."
    When the setting sun smeared the treetops, we bid farewell to the Algerian soldiers and bid farewell to the heroic positions that persisted in the struggle against the French colonialists.

    访阿尔及利亚前线
    王諱
    “离这里六十英里的地方，一场战争正在进行。这个战争是强加于一个民族的战争，他们为了独立、为了民族的生存，拿起武器，打了五年的仗。在边界那边，在一个三十公里宽的地带上，在整个边界线上，是一片战堡，是‘无人区’，法国的军事术语把它叫做‘粉碎了的土地’。因为在那里，一切东西都被摧毁了。那里有着两条防线——以设置这些防线的人而命名的‘莫里斯防线’和‘夏耳防线’。每道防线都有六层电网，电流通过这些电网，从北到南把阿尔及利亚和突尼斯隔绝开来。法国殖民主义者仍然在那里追寻着他们狂妄的‘重新占领’的殖民主义白日梦。武装到牙齿的法国殖民主义者的军队在北大西洋公约集团的支持下，对阿尔及利亚民族解放军进行‘扫荡’，但是夏耳将军一年来亲眼看见了他肯定已经被摧毁的地区，我们的军队又重新在那里出现了。1954年只有步枪装备的三千个阿尔及利亚战士，现在已经壮大成为有着新式武器的十三万年青的阿尔及利亚正规军了。”
    这是阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的代表布曼杰尔前不久在第二届全非人民大会的讲坛上发出的壮语，他的声音得到了一致的回响，聚集在突尼斯会议厅里的非洲各国的代表同声赞誉阿尔及利亚的斗争是非洲民族独立运动最前列的斗争。
    当布曼杰尔的声音还在我们耳际回响的时候，我们在结束了对第二届全非人民大会的采访工作之后，得到机会访问阿尔及利亚前线，亲眼看见了阿尔及利亚战斗的最前哨的一角。
    汽车在一条山道上行进。山那边可能就是法国殖民军队的阵地。但是我们的汽车却毫无伪装地前进。越往前走，森林越茂密。就在我们经过的一片山坳里，去年9月曾经发生过一场激烈的战斗。在英雄的阿尔及利亚战士面前，四十多个法国兵送了命，七个当了俘虏。一架法国飞机被击毁。在营部里现在还挂着这架飞机残骸的照片。尽管法国政府天天吹嘘它的“战绩”，但是就在这里，阿尔及利亚军队的防线不是后移，而是大大向前推进了。我们眼前的这片情景，不由得我回想起了抗日时期流行的一首战歌：“在密密的树林里，到处都安排同志们的宿营地，在那高高的山岗上，有我们无数的好兄弟……”。
    穿过不太长的森林公路，我们的汽车在边境前线一个营部停下来。我们在这个简单而朴素的营指挥部里，受到热情的接待。指挥部的墙上，挂着一张少女的照片，她笑容可掬，然而有着一双坚定而炯炯发光的眼睛。这就是阿尔及利亚的民族女英雄、至今还在法国监狱里受折磨的贾米拉·布伊海德。
    年轻的营首长（按照阿尔及利亚队伍里的称呼）告诉我们，这里离“莫里斯防线”不远，离“夏耳防线”更近，只有几公里。他说，你们要看看“莫里斯防线”并不难，说着就领我们走出营部。原来就在营指挥部的前面，有一堆本来没有为我们注意的铁丝网。这是这支部队从“莫里斯防线”上弄下来的一大堆防御物：一团铁丝网，缠绕在粗大的铁杆上，上面还有导电体。这使我想起几个月前在摩洛哥遇见一个刚从阿尔及利亚战区出来的女战士，当我问她怎样离开阿尔及利亚战区，从什么地方通过封锁线时，她毫不介意地说，从“莫里斯防线”过来的。法国殖民主义的将军们，企图用种种“防线”阻止阿尔及利亚民族解放军的进攻，但是一年来英雄的阿尔及利亚战士已几次大规模地突破“莫里斯防线”，“莫里斯防线”的神话已经被戳破了。“夏耳防线”也遭到了同样的命运。
    营首长从书架上取下一堆书籍，里面有阿尔及利亚部队战斗训练教程，还有一本叫做“游击战术”小册子。这位年轻军官对我们说，在这个部队里有十几本关于中国的书，战士们争相传阅，直到现在还没有轮到他手里。
    在营部稍事休息，我们改乘吉普车到第一线的一个连队去。虽然是阴天，路上还有一些泥泞，但是战士们在这里用树干筑起了无数条通往边境前沿的坚实的道路。据说，这里天天有法国飞机来骚扰，但今天是唯一的例外，法国飞机没有来。这个连队住在一片树林里，对面的山头就是敌人的防线。
    年轻的阿尔及利亚战士热情地和我们握手，他们服装整齐，精神饱满。部队的装备十分精良，这对五年前还只有步枪的阿尔及利亚战士来说，确是一个重大的变化。
    我们看见营部和连队的官兵们相遇时，热情地拥抱。他们是那样亲切友爱。据我们了解，这个部队的官兵的待遇是一律的，除了足够的供应外，每人每月有一千突尼斯法郎的薪饷。
    营首长告诉我们，这个部队里的战士多半是波尼人。他说，晴天，站在山头上，你就可以隐约望见波尼市——这个美丽的地中海滨的阿尔及利亚城市。谁不怀念自己的家乡？何况家乡就在咫尺，但是波尼在法国殖民主义者的占领下，战士们的骨肉正在受着苦难，这更激励了战士们的斗志。
    人们还记得去年8月，法国几万军队对卡比利亚山区发起进攻，企图一举消灭阿尔及利亚民族解放军的战斗力量。然而英勇的阿尔及利亚军队出其不意地打到了波尼市郊，使得一些到波尼去的形迹可疑的西方“外交官”，差一点回不了阿尔及尔，弄得这些“外交官”惊惶万状，狼狈不堪。
    我们遇见一个阿尔及利亚年青战士马絮·拉哈比，他也是在波尼长大的。当他十四、五岁在波尼上学的时候，就常常把炸弹放在书包里，使波尼的敌人吃了不少苦头，十六岁那一年（1956年）他参加了阿尔及利亚民族解放军。他的两个兄弟因为参加地下斗争被捕，现在还在波尼的法国人的监狱里。
    阿尔及利亚的官兵们都知道他们为何而战，他们对斗争前途充满了信心。当我们同连长阿卜杜勒·阿克戴谈话时，发现他还没有结婚。他笑笑对我们说，为了民族独立，结婚是次要的事情。他说，我们一定能消灭敌人，我们肯定会取得自由的，因为我们的事业是正义的。
    在这片树林里，放眼望去，战士们有的在山头上放哨，有的练兵。表面上看起来这里似乎平静无事，但是战士们告诉我们，这里每天除了法国飞机来骚扰外，敌人常常发起突袭来扰乱他们的阵地，但是敌人始终没有得逞。阿尔及利亚的战士们也常常在这里出其不意地向敌人发起进攻，因此，这里经常有小规模的战斗，有个时候，几乎每天都有战斗发生。
    随着营首长的手指望过去，这里山连着山，前沿阵地犬牙交错。
    我们还参观了前线的修械所、仓库和临时医院。士兵们住的营房里燃起了树枝、木柴来取暖，因为这里虽然是北非，但是森林里却寒风阵阵，我们和战士们一起围坐在柴火的周围谈天、取暖。
    不管在仓库、在营房、在修械所，到处都是有条有理的，战士们过着严肃和愉快的部队生活。一所临时医院的墙壁上用阿拉伯文写着这样的大字标语：“为自由而战”“阿尔及利亚必定要自由，阿尔及利亚最后一定能够获得自由”。
    当夕阳抹上树稍的时候，我们才告别了阿尔及利亚的战士，告别了与法国殖民主义者坚持斗争的英雄阵地。
