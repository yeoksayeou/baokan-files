The task of technical revolution in the postal and telecommunications departments
By our commentator

A technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is flourishing in postal and telecommunications departments across the country. According to incomplete statistics from seventeen provincial, municipal, and autonomous region bureaus, postal and telecommunications workers have proposed more than 200,000 technical innovation projects in the past two months, of which more than 90,000 have already been implemented. Complicated manual operations and heavy physical labor in the postal and telecommunications process are gradually decreasing, and the degree of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is constantly increasing. Many post and telecommunications bureaus have seen new tools and equipment such as automatic production lines, automatic conveyor belts, automatic maintenance rooms, automatic conference call switching machines, letter sorting machines, and automatic franking machines. These new tools and equipment have played a significant role in improving communication capabilities and ensuring communication quality.

The goal of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the postal and telecommunications departments is to build a nationwide, interconnected postal and telecommunications network based on modern tools. Compared with this goal, although the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the postal and telecommunications departments has achieved great results, it is still only a good start, and postal and telecommunications workers need to continue their efforts. Because China's original postal and telecommunications industry had a weak technical foundation, although it has been continuously expanded and improved over the past ten years, complicated manual operations and heavy physical labor still account for a large proportion of the postal and telecommunications process, and the degree of mechanization and automation is not high. Therefore, the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the postal and telecommunications departments should first focus on complicated manual operations and heavy physical labor, for example, in the testing, adjustment, and maintenance of machines and lines, and in the postal service's moving, transporting, loading, unloading, and internal operations, to achieve mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation; to solve the key problem of insufficient communication capacity, to increase circuits by every possible means, and to achieve multiplexing; and to meet the needs of agricultural technical transformation, to vigorously transform the rural telecommunications network, so that the conference call equipment from the county to the commune can both listen and speak; at the same time, it is also necessary to actively create motorized or semi-motorized postal transport tools suitable for various traffic conditions, and gradually eliminate the backward phenomenon of carrying, back-carrying, shouldering, and lifting.

To build a nationwide, interconnected postal and telecommunications network based on modern tools, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the postal and telecommunications departments should develop in the direction of forming complete "dragons" and networks. The so-called forming complete "dragons" and networks means that between the various processes and jobs in a post and telecommunications bureau, and between the various bureaus and stations on a postal route and circuit, there should be unified leadership, unified planning, mutual cooperation, and concerted efforts to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in a comprehensive and systematic way. The organization of the postal and telecommunications departments is extremely dispersed, while communication itself requires a high degree of unity and absolute consistency. The transmission of a newspaper and the connection of a telephone call must go through many links within the enterprise and the close connection of many enterprises to be completed quickly and smoothly. Therefore, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the postal and telecommunications departments must, according to this characteristic of postal and telecommunications, combine the technical innovation of one link and one job with the technical innovation of the entire bureau and station; and combine the technical innovation of one bureau and station with the technical innovation between bureaus and stations, so that the internal and external efforts form complete "dragons" and networks to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, so that all the innovation results can fully play a role in improving the overall efficiency of postal and telecommunications throughout the entire course and network. Recently, the experience gained by the Sichuan postal and telecommunications departments in carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution on the Chengdu-Kangding postal route has set a vivid example for the postal and telecommunications departments to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution to form complete "dragons" and networks. The Chengdu-Kangding postal route is 380 kilometers long, passes through 24 bureaus and stations, connects 41 county postal routes, and undertakes the task of transmitting newspapers and mail for 28 counties, more than 230 factories and mines, and communes in three special districts and autonomous prefectures. Under unified leadership, these bureaus and stations, focusing on the weak links with many manual operations, many people, long time consumption, and high labor intensity, determined the main direction of attack, formulated a comprehensive innovation plan, divided into sections and points, carried out large-scale cooperation, and created and innovated 73 items of large and small tools and equipment, totaling 355 pieces, within one month, basically realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of the entire course and network, and eliminating manual carrying and cumbersome manual operations. Their achievements fully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the postal and telecommunications departments in carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution to form complete "dragons" and networks.

Carrying out postal and telecommunications technical innovation and technical revolution to form complete "dragons" and networks is not only determined by the characteristics of postal and telecommunications communication, but also necessary for building a nationwide, interconnected postal and telecommunications network based on modern tools in a faster, better, and more economical way, and ensuring the sustained leap forward of the national economy. At present, the technical strength, equipment conditions, and material supply of postal and telecommunications enterprises in various places are limited, especially the material and technical conditions of the vast county postal and telecommunications bureaus and commune postal and telecommunications bureaus that directly serve agriculture and more than 500 million farmers are even worse. Under these circumstances, to quickly realize mechanization and automation, and strive for communication multiplexing, it is obviously not enough to rely solely on one link, one job, and one bureau and station working alone. Only by combining the independent work of "each household" with the cooperation of various links, jobs, bureaus, and stations, carrying out communist collaboration on a large scale, implementing mutual support between the larger and smaller, the stronger and weaker, and the resourceful and resourceless, can we concentrate superior forces and comprehensively and systematically improve the communication capabilities of the entire course and network. Many postal and telecommunications bureaus have already made remarkable achievements in this regard. For example, the Jiaozuo City Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Xinxiang Special District, Henan Province, formed a cooperation zone with the surrounding seven county postal and telecommunications bureaus. They analyzed the technical strength, equipment, and material conditions of each bureau, identified the weak links in the communication process, formulated a unified plan, and comprehensively launched technical assistance activities, promoting the communist spirit of cooperation of "when one family has difficulties, everyone helps." Within twenty days, 75.5% of the circuits from the county to the commune in the entire cooperation zone were carrierized, the commune conference calls could be used for two-way communication, and 50.7% of the production brigades had conference call equipment, achieving a large-scale harvest, greatly changing the technical outlook of postal and telecommunications communication in the entire cooperation zone, and playing an active role in supporting the local rural drought resistance and the struggle to win a bumper wheat harvest.

Postal and telecommunications departments in various places must closely rely on the leadership of party committees at all levels, adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen the communist education of large scale cooperation for the staff, strengthen organizational leadership, and according to the requirements of the sustained leap forward of the national economy and the key problems in postal and telecommunications, propose the goals of technical innovation and technical revolution for each period, and promptly check, summarize, evaluate, and compare experiences, so that the movement develops forward with one upsurge following another, and strive to arm all postal and telecommunications bureaus and communication networks with new, modern communication tools in the shortest possible time, and act as good communicators for the Party and the people.

    邮电部门技术革命的任务
    本报评论员
    一个以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动正在全国邮电部门蓬勃开展。据十七个省、市和自治区局的不完全统计，两个月来，邮电职工提出的技术革新项目就有二十多万件，已经实现的有九万多件。邮电通信过程中的繁杂的手工操作和笨重的体力劳动正在逐渐减少，机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化的程度正在不断提高。许多邮电局已经出现了自动生产流水线、自动传输带、自动维护机房、会议电话自动汇接机、信函分拣机、自动过戳机等新的工具和设备。这些新的工具和设备，对提高通信能力，保证通信质量，都起了显著的作用。
    邮电部门技术革新和技术革命运动的目标，是在全国范围内建成一个以现代工具为主的四通八达的邮电网。同这个目标相比，目前邮电部门的技术革新和技术革命运动虽然取得很大的成绩，但是仍然只是一个良好的开端，还需要邮电部门的职工继续不断地努力。由于我国原来的邮电事业技术基础薄弱，十年来虽然经过不断地扩充和改善，目前在邮电通信过程中，繁杂的手工操作和笨重的体力劳动还占很大比重，机械化、自动化程度还不高。因此，当前邮电部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，首先还是应该针对繁杂的手工操作和笨重的体力劳动，例如，在机器和线路的测试、调整、维护方面，在邮政的搬、运、装、卸和内部操作等方面，实现机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化；解决通信能力不足的关键问题，千方百计地增加电路，实现多路化；并且适应农业技术改造的需要，大力改造农村电信网路，使县到公社的会议电话设备做到能听能讲；同时还要积极创制适合各种交通条件的机动化或半机动化的邮运工具，逐步消灭扛、背、挑、抬的落后现象。
    在全国范围内建成一个以现代工具为主的四通八达的邮电网，邮电部门的技术革新和技术革命运动应该朝着成龙成网的方向发展。所谓成龙成网，就是在一个邮电局的各个工序、各个工种之间，在一条邮路和电路上的各个局站之间，要统一领导，统一规划，互相配合，通力协作，全面系统地大搞技术革新和技术革命。邮电部门的机构极端分散，而通信本身又要求高度的统一和绝对的协调一致。一张报纸的传递，一个电话的接通，都要经过企业内部的许多环节和许多企业的紧密衔接，才能迅速、顺利地完成。因此，邮电部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，必须根据邮电通信的这个特点，把一个环节、一个工种的技术革新同整个局站的技术革新结合起来；把一个局站的技术革新同局站之间的技术革新结合起来，这样内外成龙成网地大搞技术革新和技术革命，才能使所有的革新成果，都在提高全程全网的邮电通信效能中充分发挥作用。最近，四川邮电部门在成都至康定的邮路上大搞技术革新和技术革命所取得的经验，给邮电部门成龙成网的大搞技术革新和技术革命，树立了生动的榜样。成康邮路全长三百八十公里，途经二十四个局站，联系着四十一条县内邮路，担负着三个专区和自治州内二十八个县、二百三十多个厂矿和公社的报纸、邮件的传递任务。这些局、站在统一领导下，针对着那些手工操作多、费人多、费时长、劳动强度大的薄弱环节，确定主攻方向，制定全面革新规划，分段分点，大搞协作，在一个月内就创制和革新了大小工具设备七十三项共三百五十五件，基本上实现了全龙全网的机械化半机械化，消灭了人背肩挑和繁杂的手工操作。他们的成就，充分显示了邮电部门成龙成网地大搞技术革新和技术革命的无比优越性。
    成龙成网地大搞邮电技术革新和技术革命，不仅是邮电通信的特点所决定的，而且也是多快好省地在全国范围内建成一个以现代工具为主的四通八达的邮电网、保证国民经济持续跃进所必需的。目前，各地邮电企业的技术力量、设备条件和材料供应，都是有限的，特别是直接为农业和五亿多农民服务的广大县邮电局和公社邮电局的物质技术条件，就更要差些。在这种情况下，要迅速实现机械化、自动化，力争通信多路化，仅靠一个环节、一个工种、一个局站“一家一户”单干显然是不够的；只有把“一家一户”的单干同各个环节、各个工种、各个局站之间的合作结合起来，大搞共产主义协作，实行大帮小、强帮弱、有帮无，互相支援，才能集中优势力量，全面地系统地提高全程全网的通信能力。许多邮电局在这方面已经做出了显著的成绩。如河南新乡专区焦作市邮电局，同周围的七个县邮电局组成了一个协作区。他们分析了各局的技术力量和设备、材料条件，找出了通信过程中的薄弱环节，制订了统一的规划，全面地展开了技术互助活动，发扬了“一家有困难，大家来帮助”的共产主义协作精神。在二十天内，就使全协作区75.5％的县到公社电路实现了载波化，公社会议电话可以对讲，50.7％的生产大队都有会议电话设备，取得了大面积丰收，使全协作区的邮电通信技术面貌大大改观，对支援当地的农村抗旱、夺取小麦大丰收的斗争，起了积极的作用。
    各地邮电部门必须紧紧依靠各级党委的领导，坚持政治挂帅，加强对职工进行共产主义大协作教育；加强组织领导，根据国民经济持续跃进的要求和邮电通信中的关键问题，提出每个时期的技术革新和技术革命的奋斗目标，及时检查总结评比，交流经验，使运动一个高潮接着一个高潮地向前发展，力争在最短的时间内，用新的现代化的通信工具，把所有的邮电局所和通信网路武装起来，当好党和人民的通讯兵。
