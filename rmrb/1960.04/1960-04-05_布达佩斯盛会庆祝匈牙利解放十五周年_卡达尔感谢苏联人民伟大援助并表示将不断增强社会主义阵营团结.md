Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 3rd: A grand rally was held by the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government and the National Council of the Patriotic People's Front on the evening of April 3rd at the National Opera House in Budapest to warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of Hungary's liberation.
    Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and government leaders Kádár, Dobi, and Münnich, members of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Party Central Committee, government ministers, and representatives from all walks of life attended the celebration. Also present at the celebration were the Soviet delegation led by Mazurov, member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and alternate member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Hungary.
    Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, announced the opening of the meeting.
    Kádár, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, delivered a report at the meeting. He said that today, our people are celebrating the great festival of the liberation of our motherland with satisfaction in the present and confidence in the future. The fraternal people of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, as well as millions of friends around the world, are celebrating this festival with us.
    In recalling the heroic and arduous struggle of the Hungarian people against the Horthy regime and German fascism, Kádár especially mentioned the great assistance of the Soviet people. He said that the Hungarian people will forever be grateful to their liberator, the Soviet Union, and to the Soviet heroes who sacrificed their blood for the liberation of Hungary.
    Kádár pointed out that the fifteen years since liberation have been a period of historical and significant development in the lives of the Hungarian people. Industrial production has increased 3.5 times, agricultural production has increased by about 15%, and national income has approximately doubled in the last decade alone.
    Kádár pointed out that continuously strengthening and developing the national economy and increasing labor productivity are conditions for continuously improving the people's living standards. After recovering from the losses caused by the counter-revolution, the national economy has resumed its inspiring development since 1958. The working people's growing socialist consciousness and the increasingly widespread socialist labor competition are the driving forces for progress.
    Kádár pointed out that the brilliant achievements made in the socialist transformation of agriculture play a significant role in the development of the entire country, socialist construction, and the strengthening of the national economy. Today, socialist forces occupy an absolute advantage in the Hungarian countryside. We can fully call the great changes taking place among the Hungarian peasantry a new victory for the socialist revolution. He emphasized that the decisive task now is to consolidate the newly established agricultural production cooperatives politically and economically, which is also a condition for ending socialist transformation. In order to strengthen the socialist elements in agriculture, the peasant class is required to better explore and utilize its potential and diligent labor. Strengthening the socialist elements in agriculture is also the task of the entire society, the party leading social life, and the working class.
    Kádár said: Our struggle over the past fifteen years has been worthwhile. Today, socialist ideas have grown more deeply and firmly in the minds and hearts of the Hungarian working people, shining more brightly. Today, our party and the working class have more experience in struggle than in the past, and today the party and the people are united as one. Our entire nation is politically more mature than it was a few years ago. Kádár pointed out that, naturally, not everyone likes Hungary's current social system. Everyone should know that our system will continue to firmly and powerfully stand up against those who disrupt the tranquility and constructive labor of our people. The profound humanitarian essence of our system is to resolutely safeguard the pressing interests of millions of workers. Everything else here is subject to it.
    Kádár pointed out that the purpose of Hungary's domestic policy is to build socialism, and for this purpose, we are striving to unite all patriotic forces. The purpose of Hungary's foreign policy is to safeguard national independence, the achievements of socialism, and peace.
    Kádár said that, of course, we are not neutral in the struggle between socialism and capitalism; we are fighting for socialism. We firmly believe in the victory of the socialist system and hope to contribute our strength to this victory.
    Kádár pointed out that the Hungarian people are also supporters of eliminating the Cold War and establishing lasting peace. He said that we believe that the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament represents the interests of all mankind. Our people look forward to the success of the Geneva Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference. We wish the upcoming summit meeting success and resolutely oppose the revival and conspiracies of West German militarism.
    Proletarian internationalism, common socialist goals, and fruitful multilateral cooperation link us with all countries in the socialist camp. We are convinced that the existence, unity, and strength of the socialist camp are the strongest pillar of world peace today. Therefore, we will continuously strengthen the unity of the socialist camp as our constant task.
    Kádár concluded by saying that on the fifteenth anniversary of liberation, every citizen of the People's Republic can look forward to the future with confidence. We will overcome all remaining difficulties and move firmly forward on the road of socialist construction. Capitalism has failed here irreversibly, and socialist Hungary will be built.
    Mazurov spoke after Kádár's report, saying that the Soviet people were thrilled by the great achievements made by the Hungarian people in socialist construction since liberation.
    Mazurov pointed out that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has also achieved decisive victories on the ideological front because it has steadfastly opposed revisionism—the main danger in the communist and workers' movement—and various manifestations of dogmatism and sectarianism that hinder progress.
    Mazurov said that the achievements of socialist construction in Hungary prove that the policies of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party are correct, and that it is good at creatively solving the specific problems of socialist construction based on the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, and taking into account the actual situation and realistic possibilities of its own country as well as the interests of the socialist camp.
    Finally, Mazurov read out

    布达佩斯盛会庆祝匈牙利解放十五周年
    卡达尔感谢苏联人民伟大援助并表示将不断增强社会主义阵营团结
    据新华社布达佩斯3日电　匈牙利工农革命政府和爱国人民阵线全国委员会3日晚间在布达佩斯的国家歌剧院举行盛大集会，隆重庆祝匈牙利解放十五周年。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党和政府领导人卡达尔、道比和明尼赫，匈牙利党中央政治局委员们，政府各部部长和各界代表都出席了庆祝大会。出席庆祝大会的还有由苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员、苏联共产党中央委员会主席团候补委员马祖罗夫率领的苏联代表团和各国驻匈牙利的外交使节。
    匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比宣布开会。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记卡达尔在会上作了报告。他说，我国人民今天都怀着满意现在和相信未来的心情庆祝祖国解放的伟大节日。苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家的兄弟人民以及世界上成千成万的朋友们都和我们同欢共庆这一节日。
    卡达尔在追述匈牙利人民为反对霍尔蒂统治和德国法西斯而进行的英勇卓绝的斗争时，特别提到了苏联人民的伟大援助。他说，匈牙利人民将永远感谢自己的解放者——苏联，感谢为解放匈牙利而牺牲流血的苏军英雄们。
    卡达尔指出，解放后的十五年在匈牙利人民生活中是具有历史意义的巨大发展的时期。工业生产增长到过去的三点五倍，农业生产提高15％左右，国民收入仅在最近十年中就增加了一倍左右。
    卡达尔指出，不断加强和发展国民经济，提高劳动生产率，是不断地提高人民生活水平的条件。在恢复了反革命所造成的损失后，国民经济从1958年又开始了鼓舞人心的发展，劳动人民日益增长的社会主义的自觉性、愈来愈广泛展开的社会主义劳动竞赛，是向前发展的动力。
    卡达尔指出，在农业社会主义改造方面所取得的辉煌成绩，对整个国家的发展、社会主义建设和加强国民经济起着重大的作用。今天在匈牙利农村中社会主义力量已占了绝对的优势。我们完全可以把在匈牙利农民群众中所发生的伟大的变化称之为社会主义革命的新胜利。他强调说，现在从政治上、经济上巩固新成立的农业生产合作社，是决定性的任务，同时也是结束社会主义改造的条件。为了加强农业社会主义的因素，就要求农民阶级更好地发掘和运用自己的潜力和辛勤的劳动。加强农业社会主义的因素，也是整个社会，领导社会生活的党和工人阶级的任务。
    卡达尔说：我们过去十五年的斗争是有价值的。今天，社会主义思想已经更加深刻、牢固地生长在匈牙利劳动人民的思想中和心坎上，发出了更灿烂的光芒。今天，我们党和工人阶级的斗争经验比过去更加丰富了，今天党和人民是团结一致的。我们全国人民从政治上比几年前更加成熟了。卡达尔指出，自然，匈牙利目前的社会制度并不是每个人都喜欢的。人人都应当知道，我们的制度今后也将坚定地和有力地起来反对那些破坏我国人民安宁和建设性劳动的人。我们制度深刻的人道主义的实质是坚决维护千万劳动者的迫切利益。在我们这儿，一切其他东西都受其支配。
    卡达尔指出，匈牙利的对内政策的目的是建设社会主义，为了这个目的，我们在努力团结一切爱国力量。匈牙利外交政策的目的是维护民族的独立、社会主义的成果与和平。
    卡达尔说，当然，在社会主义和资本主义斗争中我们不是中立者，我们为社会主义而斗争。我们坚信社会主义制度的胜利，并且希望尽我们的力量对这个胜利有所贡献。
    卡达尔指出，匈牙利人民也是消除冷战建立持久和平的拥护者。他说，我们认为苏联全面彻底裁军的建议是代表全人类利益的。我国人民期待日内瓦十国裁军会议的成功。祝即将召开的最高级会议成功，并且坚决反对西德军国主义复活和阴谋活动。
    无产阶级国际主义、共同的社会主义目标、有成果的多方面的合作，把我们同社会主义阵营所有国家联结在一起。我们确信，今天世界和平最强大的支柱是社会主义阵营的存在、统一和力量。因此，我们将不断增强社会主义阵营的团结，作为我们的经常任务。
    卡达尔最后说，在解放十五周年时，人民共和国的每一个公民都可以充满信心地展望未来，我们将克服还存在的一切困难，在社会主义建设的道路上坚定地向前迈进。资本主义在我们这儿是一去不复返地失败了，社会主义的匈牙利将要建成。
    马祖罗夫在卡达尔报告之后讲了话，他说，苏联人民为匈牙利人民解放以来在社会主义建设方面所取得的伟大成就感到兴奋。
    马祖罗夫指出，由于匈牙利社会主义工人党坚定不移地反对了修正主义——共产主义和工人运动中的主要危险，反对了阻碍前进的教条主义和宗派主义的各种表现，所以在思想战线上也取得了决定性的胜利。
    马祖罗夫说，匈牙利社会主义建设的成就证明了社会主义工人党的政策是正确的，证明了它善于根据马克思列宁主义的基本原则，并且注意到本国的实际情况和现实可能性以及社会主义阵营的利益，来创造性地解决社会主义建设的具体问题。
    最后，马祖罗夫宣读了苏联共产党中央、苏联最高苏维埃主席团和部长会议的贺电。
    庆祝会结束后，匈牙利首都的艺术工作者演出了精彩的节目。
    新华社布达佩斯3日电　在匈牙利解放十五周年的前夕，匈牙利党政领导人卡达尔、道比、明尼赫等向布达佩斯自由广场的苏军烈士纪念碑和英雄广场的匈牙利烈士纪念碑献了花圈。
