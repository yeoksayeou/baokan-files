    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to reports, the scheduled exploration and measurement program of the Soviet Union's third artificial Earth satellite has been fully completed. The satellite entered the dense atmosphere and disintegrated on April 6, during its 10,037th orbit. Since its launch on May 15, 1958, the satellite flew for a total of 691 days and nights, covering over 448 million kilometers. This is approximately nine times the distance between Earth and Mars, and eleven times the distance between Earth and Venus.

    On the morning of April 6, when the third satellite was making its 10,035th orbit, observation stations located within the Soviet Union received the satellite's final radio signals and recorded them until it moved out of the Soviet observation network's range. The lifespan of the third satellite greatly exceeded that of the Soviet Union's first two artificial satellites. The first satellite existed for 94 days, orbiting the Earth 1,440 times, and the second satellite existed for 163 days, orbiting the Earth 2,370 times. The existence period of this satellite greatly exceeded the calculations.

    According to Professor Dobronravov, a prominent Soviet scientist, this was because the third satellite had good flight and aerodynamic performance. It was streamlined and could resist libration, preventing relative rotation around its center of gravity. All of these factors reduced the resistance encountered in the atmosphere, extending the satellite's lifespan.

    The third satellite obtained many valuable materials. The Soviet Union obtained and processed over 130,000 data points transmitted by the satellite's "lighthouse" radio transmitter. In addition, approximately 28,500 optical observations from Soviet observation stations and approximately 19,800 optical observations contributed by foreign countries were obtained and processed.

    The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an article pointing out that the exploration results of this satellite have greatly enriched our knowledge of the upper atmosphere and outer space, leading to some new discoveries of major principle significance: it discovered the outer radiation belt surrounding the Earth and obtained valuable materials on the distribution of heavy atomic nuclei in primary cosmic radiation.

    苏联第三个人造卫星收获丰富
    胜利完成了考察宇宙任务后已在六日陨灭
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联第三个人造地球卫星的预定考察和测量计划已经全部完成，卫星于4月6日在运行到第一万零三十七圈时进入稠密大气层陨灭。这个卫星从1958年5月15日上天以来，一共飞行了六百九十一昼夜，在此期间飞过了四亿四千八百多万公里，这约等于地球同火星之间的距离的九倍，地球同金星之间的距离的十一倍。
    位于苏联境内的各个观测站在4月6日上午第三个卫星运行第一万零三十五圈时还接收到卫星的最后的无线电讯号，并且一直纪录到它越出苏联观测网视野的时刻。第三个卫星的存在时期大大超过了苏联的前两个人造卫星。第一个卫星存在了九十四天，围绕地球运行了一千四百四十圈，第二个卫星存在了一百六十三天，围绕地球运行了二千三百七十圈。这个卫星存在的时期远远超过了计算。
    苏联著名科学家多勃隆拉沃夫教授说，这是因为第三个卫星具有良好的飞行和航空动力性能，它是流线型的，可以抗天平动，也就是可以防止围绕自己的重心的相对自转。所有这些，导致了在大气层中遇到的阻力减小，延长了卫星存在期限。
    第三个卫星获得了许多宝贵资料。苏联获得并整理了卫星“灯塔”无线电发射机发来的近十三万多份资料。此外，还获得并整理了苏联各观测站约两万八千五百次光学观测结果和外国交来的约一万九千八百次光学观测结果。
    苏联“真理报”发表文章指出，这个卫星的考察结果大大丰富了我们关于大气高层、宇宙空间的知识，导致了一些具有重大原则意义的新发现：它发现了环绕地球的外辐射带，还获得了原始宇宙辐射中重原子核分布的有价值的材料。
