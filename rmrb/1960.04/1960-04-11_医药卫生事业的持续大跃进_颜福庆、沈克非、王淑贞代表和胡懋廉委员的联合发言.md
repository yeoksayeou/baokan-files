The Continued Great Leap Forward in Medical and Health Undertakings
Joint Speech by Representatives Yan Fuqing, Shen Kefei, Wang Shuzhen, and Committee Member Hu Maolian

Presidium, fellow committee members:

We fully agree with and support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin; we also fully agree with the work report of Vice Chairman Chen Shutong of the CPPCC.

Now, we will briefly address the conference regarding the health work in Shanghai and the medical education work at Shanghai First Medical College.

	I. Shanghai Health Work

Due to the correct leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the firm implementation of the Party's General Line and various health work guidelines and policies by the health authorities, Shanghai's health work in 1959 presented another Great Leap Forward situation. We will now report on what two of us have recently inspected:

	(1) Pest Elimination and Disease Eradication: The mass patriotic health movement in 1959 continued to focus on pest elimination and disease eradication, achieving great results on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Through twelve city-wide large-scale shock campaigns, the situation of the "seven pests" has been greatly improved. According to the results of the comprehensive inspection at the end of 1959, the number of fly-free and mosquito-free households in the city exceeded 93% of the total number of households. In the suburban areas where Oncomelania snails were present, almost half of the 85.78 million square meters of area had reached the point of complete or basic eradication. As of the end of 1959, 93.7% of schistosomiasis patients, 72% of hookworm disease patients, and 72% of filariasis patients had been treated, and all malaria patients had been treated. The prevalence of dysentery and other intestinal infectious diseases, as well as measles and other acute infectious diseases, was much smaller than in 1958. In addition, the sanitation work in collective places such as public canteens and childcare institutions has been greatly improved. The mass pest elimination and disease eradication movement in 1959 was closely integrated with industrial and agricultural production, thus implementing the principle of "health for production, production emphasizing health."

	(2) Medical and Preventive Work: Since the Municipal Party Committee put forward the central task of improving the quality of medical care in hospitals in 1959, medical institutions at all levels immediately mobilized to resolutely implement the spirit of the Municipal Party Committee's instructions, thereby generally improving medical work throughout the city. This can be seen from the following aspects: 1. Many hospitals improved their diagnostic accuracy. Due to the adoption of comprehensive medical measures and the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, the cure rate was greatly improved, and the mortality rate was greatly reduced. According to statistics from twenty-one urban central hospitals, the average cure rate of various diseases in 1959 increased by 3% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. 2. The chaotic situation in the outpatient work of large hospitals has been basically overcome, and the waiting time for outpatient patients has been greatly shortened, generally from two to four hours in the past to one hour or even less. 3. Many hospitals have achieved satisfactory results in guiding the health care work of factories, mines, or neighborhoods. Due to the implementation of the principle of preventive work centered on hospitals, the absenteeism rate due to illness in factories throughout the city was further reduced in 1959. According to a general survey of 600,000 employees in 544 factories, the incidence rate in 1959 decreased by 9% compared to 1958. 4. More importantly, the ideological awareness of medical personnel has been improved, their sense of responsibility has been strengthened, and their service attitude has been improved. Rescuing critically ill patients and promoting the spirit of large-scale collaboration have become common practices among medical personnel. In 1959 alone, hospitals throughout the city saved the lives of 11,278 critically ill patients.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the number of medical institutions in the city has greatly increased. According to statistics from 1959, there were 707 hospitals in the city, with a total of 28,495 beds (including 3,098 simple beds), an increase of nearly 10,000 beds compared to the 18,980 beds in 1957. The number of outpatient institutions has also increased from 1,148 in 1957 to 1,914 in 1959.

	(3) Medical Science Research Work: Under the leadership of the Municipal Science and Technology Commission, Shanghai's medical science research work also achieved great results in 1959. In order to vigorously promote scientific research and make breakthroughs in cutting-edge areas, twenty medical specialty research groups were established throughout the city. Due to putting politics in command, the medical science research work in the past year has shown a particularly significant Great Leap Forward situation. A total of 3,216 important research topics were completed throughout the year, 1.4 times more than the 1,360 completed in 1958. Many projects have reached advanced levels both domestically and internationally.

	(4) Training Cadres: Since the Great Leap Forward, the number of medical education institutions in the city has greatly increased. In addition to establishing an advanced studies college and reorganizing and expanding the health cadre school into a higher medical vocational school, all secondary health vocational schools were reorganized and consolidated in 1959. After the adjustment, the length of schooling for various majors was determined in a categorized manner. There are now 60 secondary health vocational schools, including two new majors in biological products and traditional Chinese medicine established to meet the needs.

The above is a brief overview of the health work in Shanghai.

	II. Education Work at Shanghai First Medical College

Since the Great Leap Forward, the spiritual outlook of Shanghai First Medical College has undergone extremely profound changes. Due to the strengthening of Party leadership and the adherence to putting politics in command, not only has the quality of teaching been greatly improved, but also great achievements have been made in medical and health work and scientific research work.

	(1) Resolutely implement the Party's education policy and continuously improve the quality of education: Since the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party, Shanghai First Medical College has resolutely implemented the Party's education policy, broken through the shackles of bourgeois educational ideology, organized the majority of teachers and students to go deep into rural areas and factories to participate in productive labor, and worked with local health workers to widely carry out pest elimination and disease eradication work. Through labor and practical work training, the political awareness of teachers and students has been generally improved, and their labor viewpoints, mass viewpoints, and class viewpoints have been strengthened, fundamentally changing the past phenomenon of education being detached from politics, detached from production, and detached from reality. In the past two years, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution, with the gradual deepening of the education revolution, all teachers and students have always maintained vigorous revolutionary spirit and established fixed bases in rural and urban areas to better implement the three-way combination of education policy. For example, in the past two years, a total of 4,557 teachers and students have been organized to go to schistosomiasis-endemic areas to carry out schistosomiasis prevention and control work, completing 1.63 million person-times of disease screening, treating 50,000 patients, and participating in comprehensive snail eradication work in epidemic areas covering more than 25 million square meters of area. Through the experimental field work of schistosomiasis prevention and control, teachers and students have initially summarized a set of experiences in schistosomiasis prevention and control in plain water network areas, mastered the life cycle of Oncomelania snails and the methods of eliminating Oncomelania snails. Great achievements have been made in fecal harmlessness, safe water use, and personal protection. In terms of the mechanism of antimony agent treatment and drug research, especially in the comprehensive treatment of advanced schistosomiasis with traditional Chinese medicine and the surgical treatment of splenectomy, students have also participated in specific work and achieved remarkable results, saving countless labor forces. In the cities, Shanghai First Medical College organized teachers and students to go deep into factories and neighborhoods, focusing on improving working conditions and eliminating occupational diseases and various infectious diseases, combining teaching, labor, and scientific research work, and combining on-site teaching, inter-class practice, and production practice. For example, during this year's winter vacation, our college organized 525 teachers and students to complete a survey of the incidence of occupational diseases and the production environment in 310 chemical and light industrial factories throughout Shanghai in just eleven days, and improved equipment and strengthened labor protection systems in 157 of these factories, directly promoting production. For example, at the China Gelatin Capsule Factory, after effective measures were taken, the concentration of toxic gases in the air was reduced. This not only protected the health of workers, but also encouraged labor enthusiasm and improved labor productivity, ensuring that the factory completed 30 days of production tasks in one day. In order to support agricultural production, our college created a one-step synthesis method for the insecticide "Dipterex," and now we have successfully researched pipeline production, which greatly simplifies production equipment and creates conditions for automation. In terms of pharmacy, we have also synthesized an effective antidote PAM for organic phosphorus insecticide poisoning. In order to quickly control the epidemic of infectious hepatitis, our college organized teachers and students to go deep into the epidemic areas in November last year to carry out prevention and control work. After four months of efforts, with the cooperation of all parties, we have initially summarized a set of prevention and control measures for infectious hepatitis combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Currently, on the one hand, we are conducting in-depth research on the pathogenesis of infectious hepatitis, and on the other hand, we have promoted these summarized experiences to the whole city.

Practice has proved that organizing teachers and students to go to the front line to carry out mass pest elimination and disease eradication work is a good way to implement the Party's education policy, integrate theory with practice, and develop medical education at high speed. Through practical work training, not only has the knowledge field of teachers been expanded, the teaching content has been enriched, and their professional level has been improved, but also the students' comprehensive development and independent working ability have been cultivated, and they have also learned a complete set of skills in investigation and research, disease prevention and treatment, and organization and leadership of mass health work. More importantly, after contacting reality, the political awareness and ideological understanding of teachers and students have been greatly improved, the feelings of workers and peasants have been established, and the viewpoint of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers has been further clarified.

In addition, a Great Leap Forward has also occurred in the sports movement of our college. In 1959, the student rowing team broke the highest record of the 16th Olympic Games and won six gold medals and five silver and bronze medals at the First National Games. The physical fitness of the students has been greatly improved.

The patriotic health movement has also won national or municipal red flags for two consecutive years.

With the rapid development of the new situation, how to carry out continuous education revolution, continue to improve the quality of teaching, and thus improve the scientific level in teaching, has become an urgent task of our college. In order to solve these problems, our college, according to the instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, actively carried out creative teaching and creative learning movements. In the past year, the learning quality of students has been significantly improved, and considerable achievements have also been made in cultivating students' independent working ability. Now we are gradually building some cutting-edge and blank new majors and new courses. The following have been established: biophysics and other majors, and a group of modern laboratories have been built. In addition, we are also thoroughly innovating the original teaching content, establishing a new curriculum system, and gradually compiling teaching outlines and textbooks that can both reflect modern scientific achievements and combine with China's actual situation.

	(2) Walking on two legs, vigorously developing spare-time education and advanced studies education: In order to accelerate the development of medical education and meet the requirements of large-scale improvement and large-scale popularization, under the correct leadership of the Party committee at the higher level, following Chairman Mao's instructions, while running full-time education well, our college fully explored potential and vigorously developed spare-time higher medical education and cadre advanced studies education, and achieved great results.

Since the Great Leap Forward, our college has established a four-year night university, setting up three majors: medical care, health, and pharmacy, and running a two-year obstetrics and gynecology physician advanced studies course, with a total of 430 students. Most of the students come from primary factories and middle-level medical and health cadres in medical prevention and health care institutions. Since its establishment, under the leadership of the Party committee, we have continuously solved various ideological problems, taught students according to their aptitude, and adopted the method of consolidating learning in stages according to the characteristics of spare-time education. At present, the night university has begun to embark on the stage of improvement and development. In the past year and a half, the number of students who insisted on learning accounted for 87% of the number of enrolled students. The students are very enthusiastic about learning, and not only have their theoretical knowledge level and practical working ability been significantly improved, but also they have made great progress in political ideology. Many vivid examples of students insisting on learning have emerged among the students. Some students have been able to take on the work of primary physicians in their original units after studying, and are playing a greater role in medical prevention and health care positions, improving the quality of work. In terms of the number of graduates, for example, if we calculate based on the current situation, the medical, health, and obstetrics and gynecology physician advanced studies courses graduate an average of 180 people every two years, and the pharmacy major graduates 70 people every year. From 1962 to 1967, 1,000 senior physicians and pharmacists can be trained. Compared with the fact that Shanghai First Medical College only graduated 535 people in the 22 years before liberation, the graduates of a night university are equal to more than twice the total number before liberation. The training task of advanced studies members has also increased from more than 160 people before 1957 to 200 people in 1958 and 300 people in 1959. This year, it will continue to increase. These facts fully prove that vigorously developing spare-time education and advanced studies education is a good way to train medical and health cadres in a faster, better, and more economical way by walking on two legs. It is a further implementation of the Party's education policy and a glorious victory of Mao Zedong Thought in education work.

	(3) Organize and develop the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, create a new medical school, and climb the peak of world medical science: Since the Great Leap Forward, especially after studying the Party Central Committee’s approval of the summary report of the Party group of the Ministry of Health on organizing Western medicine doctors to study traditional Chinese medicine classes and the People’s Daily published the editorial "Conscientiously Implement the Party's Traditional Chinese Medicine Policy," all teachers and students in the college thoroughly criticized the idea of ​​despising and rejecting traditional Chinese medicine. Subsequently, a new upsurge of mass learning of traditional Chinese medicine was launched. In the first three months, more than 3,300 teachers and students in the college participated in the study, initially mastering acupuncture therapy and basic theoretical knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine. By adopting the method of learning, using, and researching simultaneously, traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine began to be widely used in clinical practice, achieving significant results, and summarizing many effective treatment methods. In the past two years, the college has published a total of 217 research papers and clinical treatment experience summaries on traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, formulated treatment routines combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine for 33 diseases, and collected a large number of single prescriptions and folk remedies. After sorting out, some have been applied to clinical practice and have received good results.

In medical work, due to the widespread use of traditional Chinese medicine or the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, the quality of medical care has been greatly improved, and problems that Western medicine considered unsolvable in the past have been solved. For example, the mortality rate of critically ill patients with severe brain trauma rescued through cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine has been reduced from about 80% in the past to 20%. For another example, the cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the treatment of advanced schistosomiasis has enabled the ascites of 70% of patients with cirrhosis to subside smoothly. Diseases that were previously considered to require surgery for treatment, such as acute appendicitis, can now basically be replaced by acupuncture. For example, the efficacy of Qigong therapy for peptic ulcer reaches 90%, which is far better than the effect that Western medicine alone can achieve. In addition, obvious curative effects have been achieved in traditional Chinese medicine treatment of infectious hepatitis, acupuncture treatment of optic nerve atrophy, deafness, and indigestion in children.

In order to deeply understand the theoretical mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine, our college organized internal and external collaborations, combining basic medicine with clinical practice, to study the mechanism of action of meridians and acupuncture, the physiological mechanism of Qigong therapy, and the pathogenesis of advanced schistosomiasis and infectious hepatitis, and initial achievements have been made.

In order to explain the physiological mechanism of Qigong therapy, based on the summary of treatment experience of hypertension and peptic ulcer, we comprehensively observed the changes in the respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems during the exercise process, and preliminarily confirmed the relationship between respiratory activity and the center of the autonomic nervous system through animal experiments, and proposed a theoretical assumption for the treatment of many diseases, which has attracted the attention of Chinese and Soviet physiologists. Although the preliminary results of Qigong therapy research have directly promoted the solution of treatment problems such as hypertension and peptic ulcer, in order to understand the internal relationship between respiratory activity and the autonomic nervous system, our college is studying the effect of "regulating breathing" and "intentional guarding" on the activity of human internal organs during exercise. If the rules of these effects are clarified, not only will the efficacy of Qigong therapy be greatly improved, but also humans can control the activity of internal organs with their own consciousness, which is a further step than using conditioned reflexes to control the activity of internal organs. This is a further development of the theory of higher nervous activity. Therefore, if the mechanisms of acupuncture and Qigong therapy can be clarified, it will inevitably make a great contribution to the creation of China's new medical school.

	(4) Launch technical innovation and technical revolution to tackle cutting-edge problems: The rapid development of industrial and agricultural production will surely bring higher and higher requirements for the medical and health professions. In order to adapt to this situation, our medical and health circles must constantly improve the level of medical science and technology. Therefore, since the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party, relying on the masses, the college has vigorously engaged in scientific research and widely launched technical innovation and technical revolution movements, all of which have achieved great results. For example, in 1959, 712 scientific research topics were completed, which is equivalent to the sum of 1954-1957, more than twice that of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and 1,423 important technical innovation and revolution projects were completed. In 1960, a good start was achieved, and another 219 research topics were completed. At the same time, the college also organized forces to attack the stubborn fortresses in medical science, such as cutting-edge problems such as malignant tumors, cardiovascular diseases, and brain diseases. Since the Great Leap Forward, our college has conducted a tumor survey of 130,000 people in cooperation with local health institutions. We have also completed the analysis of more than 50,000 cases of pathological specimens, studied the pathogenesis and early diagnostic methods of several tumors, and adopted a combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine to treat malignant tumors, brain trauma, coronary atherosclerosis and other diseases, and achieved initial results. In terms of cardiovascular surgery, our college cooperated with relevant units in Shanghai to successfully manufacture China's first artificial heart-lung machine, and it has been successfully used in various complex cardiac surgery operations for many times, thus saving many heart patients who were previously considered untreatable. We are now further studying the various physiological and biochemical changes related to extracorporeal circulation and hypothermia. All teachers and students of our college have the confidence and determination to make significant achievements in the above-mentioned cutting-edge scientific issues in two or three years under the leadership of the Party.

1960 is the first year of the 1960s, and it is an era of higher-speed continuous leap forward in China's socialist construction. We realize that in such a great situation, as long as we closely rely on the leadership of the Party, follow the mass line, further emancipate our minds, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely implement the Party's education policy and various health work guidelines and policies, we will surely achieve greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in health work and medical education work.

专栏：

    医药卫生事业的持续大跃进
    颜福庆、沈克非、王淑贞代表和胡懋廉委员的联合发言主席团、各位委员：
    我们完全同意和拥护李富春副总理，李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告；我们也完全同意陈叔通副主席的政协的工作报告。
    现在我们就上海市卫生工作和上海第一医学院医学教育工作两方面扼要的向大会发言。
      一、上海市卫生工作
    由于上海市委的正确领导与卫生当局的坚决贯彻党的总路线和各项卫生工作方针政策，上海市的卫生工作在1959年代里又呈现了一个大跃进局面。兹将我们中间二人最近视察所及汇报如下：
      （一）除害灭病工作：1959年的群众性爱国卫生运动仍以除害灭病为中心，在1958年大跃进的基础上又获得了很大的战果。经十二次全市性大规模的突击活动，七害的情况大为改善，根据1959年底大检查的结果，全市无蝇无蚊户已超过总户数的93％，在郊区曾有钉螺的八千五百七十八万平方米面积区域中，几乎一半已达到彻底消灭或者基本消灭的程度，至1959年底为止，已治疗的血吸虫病人为患者总数的 93.7％，已治疗的钩虫病人和丝虫病人各为72％，而瘧疾病人则已全部经过治疗。痢疾和其他肠道传染病以及麻疹和其他急性传染病的流行程度远较1958年为小。此外，公共食堂、托儿机构等集体场所的卫生工作均有很大的改进。1959年的群众性除害灭病运动是密切结合了工农业生产开展的，因此它也贯彻了“卫生为生产、生产讲卫生”的方针。
    （二）医疗预防工作：自市委提出1959年医院应以提高医疗质量为中心任务后，各级医疗机构立即动员起来，千方百计地贯彻市委指示的精神，因而全市医疗工作得到普遍提高。这可于以下几方面来看：1、许多医院提高了它们的诊断正确率。由于采用了综合医疗措施和中西医结合疗法，治愈率大大提高，病死率大大减低。根据二十一个市区中心医院的统计，1959年各项疾病的平均治愈率比大跃进的1958年还要提高3％。2、大医院门诊工作的忙乱现象是基本上克服了，门诊病人候诊时间大为缩短，一般已由过去二至四小时减至一小时或者还短的时间。3、在指导工厂、矿场或地段的卫生保健工作，很多医院获得了令人满意的成绩。由于贯彻了以医院为中心的预防工作的方针，全市工厂的因病缺勤率在1959年内又进一步地降低。根据五百四十四个厂内六十万职工的普查统计，1959年的发病率比1958年降低9％。4、更重要的表现是：医务人员的思想觉悟提高了，责任心加强了，服务态度改善了。抢救危急病人，发扬大协作精神，已成为医务人员的普遍风气。在1959年一年中，全市医院共挽救了一万一千二百七十八名危急病人的生命。
    大跃进以来，全市医疗机构有了很大发展，据1959年统计，全市已有七百零七所，医院共有病床二万八千四百九十五张（包括三千零九十八张简易病床在内），这比1957年的一万八千九百八十张增长了近一万张。门诊机构也从1957年的一千一百四十八个发展到1959年的一千九百一十四个。
    （三）医学科学研究工作：在市科委的领导下，上海市医学科学研究工作在1959年里，也获得了巨大的成绩。为了大搞科研并且突破尖端，全市成立了二十个医学专业专题研究组。由于政治挂帅，一年来医学科学研究工作，特别显著地出现了大跃进局面，全年完成了重要研究题目三千二百一十六项比1958年中所完成的一千三百六十项多一点四倍，不少项目是达到国内、外先进水平。
      （四）培养干部：大跃进以来，市的医学教育机构有了很大的发展。除创立了一所进修学院和改组扩建卫生干部学校为高等医学专科学校外，在1959年内还整顿和巩固了所有中等卫生专科学校，调整后分门别类地确定了各项专业的学制。现在共有六十所中等卫生专业学校，包括为了适应需要而新成立的生物制品和中药两个新专业。
    以上是上海市卫生工作的简况。
    二、上海第一医学院教育工作
    大跃进以来，上海第一医学院的精神面貌起了极其深刻的变化。由于加强了党的领导和坚持政治挂帅，不仅教学质量大大提高，而医药卫生工作和科学研究工作也均取得了巨大的成绩。
    （一）坚决贯彻党的教育方针，不断提高教育质量：大跃进以来，上海第一医学院在党的领导下，坚决贯彻了党的教育方针，冲破了资产阶级教育思想的束缚，组织了广大师生深入农村和工厂，参加生产劳动，并与地方卫生工作人员一起，广泛开展了除害灭病工作。通过劳动和实际工作锻炼，师生们的政治觉悟普遍提高，劳动观点，群众观点和阶级观点都加强了，并从根本上改变了过去教育脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的现象。两年来，在毛主席的不断革命的思想指导下，随着教育革命的逐步深入，全体师生始终保持着旺盛的革命干劲，在农村与城市中建立起固定基地，以便更好地贯彻三结合的教育方针。例如在最近两年中，先后组织了师生四千五百五十七人次前往血吸虫病流行地区进行血吸虫病防治工作，完成了一百六十三万人次的查病工作，治疗病人达五万人，参加了流行病区的全面灭螺工作达二千五百多万平方米的面积。通过防治血吸虫病的试验田工作，师生们已初步总结出一套平原水网地区防治血吸虫病的经验，掌握了钉螺的生活规律和消灭钉螺的方法。在粪便无害化，安全用水和个人防护方面均取得了很大成绩。在锑剂治疗机制和药物研究，特别是治疗晚期血吸虫病的中医综合疗法和脾脏切除的外科手术治疗方面，学生们也参加了具体工作并且取得了显著成绩，挽救了无数劳动力。在城市里，上海第一医学院组织师生深入工厂和地段，以改善劳动条件，消灭职业病和各种传染病为中心，把教学、劳动与科学研究工作结合起来，并把现场教学、课间实习与生产实习也结合起来。例如今年寒假，我院组织了师生五百二十五人，在短短的十一天内完成了上海全市三百一十个化学工业与轻工业工厂的职业病发病情况和生产环境的调查，并在其中一百五十七个工厂中改进了设备，健全了劳动保护制度，直接促进了生产。如在中国胶丸厂，在采取有效措施以后，就降低了空气中有毒气体的浓度。这样既保护了工人的健康，也鼓舞了劳动热情，提高了劳动生产率，保证了该厂一天内完成三十天的生产任务。为了支援农业生产，我院曾创造了杀虫农药“敌百虫”的一步合成法，现又研究成功管道式的生产，大大简化了生产设备，为自动化创造了条件。在药学方面还合成了有机磷杀虫药中毒的有效解毒药PAM。为了迅速控制传染性肝灸的流行，我院在去年11月间组织了师生深入流行地区开展防治工作。经过四个月来的努力，在各方面的协作下，已初步总结出一套中西医结合的传染性肝炎的防治措施。目前一方面在深入研究传染性肝炎发病机制，另一方面已把这些总结出来的经验推广到全市。
    实践证明，组织师生到现场去大搞群众性的除害灭病工作，是贯彻党的教育方针，理论联系实际，高速度发展医学教育的好办法。通过实际工作的锻炼，不仅扩大了教师们的知识领域，充实了教学内容，提高了他们的业务水平，而且也培养了学生们的全面发展和独立工作能力，同时使他们学会了调查研究，防治疾病和组织领导群众性的卫生工作的成套本领。更重要的是接触实际以后，大大提高了师生们的政治觉悟和思想认识，树立了工农感情，进一步明确了为工农兵服务的观点。
    此外，我院体育运动也出现了大跃进。1959年学生划船队打破世界十六届奥运会最高纪录，在第一届全国运动会上获得金质奖章六块，银质铜质奖章五块，学生的体质有很大提高。
  爱国卫生运动两年来也连获全国或市红旗。
    随着新形势的飞跃发展，如何进行不断的教育革命，继续提高教学质量，从而提高教学中的科学水平，已成为我院当前迫切任务。为了解决这些问题，我院根据上海市委指示，积极地开展了创造性教学和创造性学习运动。一年来学生的学习质量有显著的提高，培养学生的独立工作能力方面也取得了不少成绩。现又在逐步建设一些尖端而又是空白的新专业和新课程。目前已经成立的有：生物物理等专业，并建设起一批现代化的实验室。此外，我们还在彻底地革新原有的教学内容，建立新的课程体系，逐步编写出既能反映现代科学成就，又能结合中国实际情况的教学大纲和教科书。
    （二）两条腿走路，大办业余教育和进修教育：为了加速发展医学教育事业，满足大提高、大普及的要求，我院在上级党委的正确领导下，遵循毛主席的指示，在办好全日制教育的同时，充分发掘潜力，大办业余高等医学教育和干部进修教育，取得了很大成绩。
    大跃进以来，我院创办了一所四年制的夜大学，设置了医疗、卫生、药学三个专业，并办了一班二年制的妇产科医师专修科，共有学生四百三十人。大多数学员来自基层工厂和医疗预防、卫生保健机构中的中级医药卫生干部。开办以来，在党委的领导下，根据业余教育的特点，不断解决各种思想问题，因材施教以及采用分段巩固学习的办法，目前夜大学已开始走上提高和发展的阶段。一年半来，坚持学习的学员占入学人数的87％，学员们学习的热情很高，不仅在理论知识水平和实际工作能力有显著提高，而且在政治思想上也有很大进步，学员中出现了许多坚持学习的生动事例。有些学员经过学习，目前已能担任原单位的初级医师的工作，在医疗预防和卫生保健岗位上，正在发挥更大的作用，提高了工作质量。在培养数量方面，如以目前情况为例，医疗、卫生、妇产科医师专修科平均每两年毕业一百八十人，药学专业每年毕业七十人计算，从1962年到1967年就可培养一千名高级医师和药师。与上海第一医学院解放前二十二年只毕业五百三十五人比较，一个夜大学的毕业生就等于解放前总数的二倍之多。进修员的培养任务也从1957年以前一百六十多人，在1958年增加到二百人，1959年增加到三百人，今年还要继续增加。这些事实都充分证明大办业余教育和进修教育是两条腿走路、多快好省地培养医药卫生干部的好办法，是党的教育方针的进一步贯彻，也是毛泽东思想在教育工作中的光辉的胜利。
    （三）整理发扬祖国医学遗产，创立新医学派，攀登世界医学科学高峰：大跃进以来，特别是在学习党中央对卫生部党组关于组织西医离职学习中医班总结报告的批示和人民日报发表“认真贯彻党的中医政策”的社论之后，全院师生深入批判了轻视和排斥中医的思想，随着就掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的学习中医的新高潮，在开头的三个月中，全院师生就有三千三百多人参加学习，初步掌握针灸疗法和中医的基础理论知识，采取边学边用边研究的方法，中医中药开始在临床上广泛应用，取得了显著效果，并总结出许多有效的治疗方法。两年来，全院发表了中医中药研究论文和临床治疗经验总结共二百一十七篇，制订了三十三种病症的中西医结合的治疗常规，收集了大量的单方验方，经过整理，部分已应用于临床，收到良好的效果。
    在医疗工作上，由于广泛采用中医或中西医相结合的治疗方法，医疗质量大大提高，并且解决了过去西医认为无法解决的问题，例如中西医合作抢救严重脑外伤病人，病死率从过去的80％左右降低到20％。又例如中西医合作治疗晚期血吸虫病，使70％的肝硬化病人的腹水顺利地消退。过去认为一定要开刀才能治疗的疾病如急性阑尾炎等，现在基本上可以用针灸来替代开刀了。再例如气功治疗溃疡病其疗效达90％，远远超过西医单独能得到的效果。此外，在中医治疗传染性肝炎，针灸治疗视神经萎缩、耳聋、小儿消化不良等方面均取得了明显疗效。
    为了深入了解中医的理论机制，我院组织了院内、外大协作，基础医学结合临床，进行研究经络针灸的作用机制，气功疗法的生理机制，以及晚期血吸虫病和传染性肝炎的发病机制等，均已获得初步成绩。
    为了阐明气功疗法的生理机制方面，我们在总结高血压与溃疡病治疗经验的基础上，全面观察了练功过程中呼吸、循环和神经等系统的变化，并通过动物实验，初步证实了呼吸活动与植物性神经中枢之间的关系，提出了治疗许多疾病的理论上设想，引起了我国和苏联生理学家们的重视。目前气功疗法研究的初步成果虽然已经直接推动了解决高血压和溃疡病等的治疗问题，但是为了了解呼吸活动与植物性神经系统的内在关系，我院正在研究练功中“调息”和“意守”对人体内脏活动的作用，如果这些作用规律得到阐明，不但大大提高气功疗法的疗效，而且人类用自己的意识控制内脏活动就可成为经常事实，这比条件反射来控制内脏活动又提高了一步，这是高级神经活动学说的进一步发展。因此针灸和气功疗法机制如果能得到阐明，将必然为创立我国新医学派作出巨大贡献。
      （四）展开技术革新、技术革命，攻克尖端问题：工农业生产的飞跃发展，一定会给医药卫生专业带来越来越高的要求，为了适应这个形势，我们医药卫生界必须不断地提高医学科学水平和技术水平。因此大跃进以来，我院在党的领导下，依靠群众，大搞了科学研究工作和广泛开展了技术革新、技术革命运动，均获得了巨大的成绩。例如，1959年完成的科学研究题目就有七百一十二个，相当于1954—1957年的总和，超过了大跃进的1958年的两倍，完成重要的技术革新、革命项目一千四百二十三个，1960年实现开门红，又完成了研究题目二百一十九个。与此同时，我院也组织了力量，猛攻医学科学中顽固堡垒，如恶性肿瘤、心脏血管疾病和脑部疾病等尖端问题。大跃进以来，我院与当地卫生机构共同进行了十三万人的肿瘤普查。我们还完成五万余例的病理标本的分析，研究了若干肿瘤的发病机制和早期诊断方法，采用了中西医结合的方法治疗恶性肿瘤、脑外伤、冠状动脉硬化等疾患，取得了初步成绩。在心血管外科方面，我院与上海市有关单位大协作，制造成功我国第一架人工心肺机，并且已经多次顺利地运用于各种复杂的心脏外科手术，因而挽救了不少过去认为无法治疗的心脏病人。现在正在进一步研究有关体外循环和低温状态下的各种生理生化变化。我院全体师生有信心也有决心在党的领导下，在两、三年内在上述几项尖端科学问题上要作出显著成绩。
    1960年是二十世纪六十年代的第一年，是我国社会主义建设的更高速度持续跃进的年代。我们认识到在这样大好形势下，只要紧紧依靠党的领导，走群众路线，进一步解放思想，以毛泽东思想武装自己，坚决贯彻党的教育方针和各项卫生工作方针政策，我们一定能在卫生工作和医学教育工作方面实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
