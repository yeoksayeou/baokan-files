Qinghai Launches a Blitz on Late-Season Planting
    In early and mid-April, Qinghai Province experienced widespread spring rains and snow. This rainfall and snowfall connected with the underlying soil moisture in most areas, which is very beneficial for rushing the planting of late-season crops, the germination and growth of early-season crops, and land reclamation. Various prefectures and counties are seizing the opportunity to launch a blitz on late-season planting.

Liaoning Rushes Planting While Soil Moisture is Good
    Recently, Liaoning Province has had several spring rains. Farmers throughout the province are taking advantage of the favorable soil moisture conditions after the rain to carry out spring plowing and sowing with all their strength.

Xinjiang Vigorously Expands Early Corn Planting
    The Agriculture Department of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region recently issued an urgent notice requiring the vigorous expansion of early corn planting. The Hotan region, in more than ten days of fighting drought, has already rushed the planting of over 220,000 mu of early corn and will soon be able to rush the planting of 1 million mu of early corn.

Half of Yunnan Prefecture and County Cadres Participate in Drought Resistance
    The spring plowing production campaign in Yunnan Province, centered on drought resistance, is developing in depth. More than 50% of the cadres from prefecture and county offices have been transferred to participate in drought resistance. The people of the province are making every effort to increase the water supply to farmland by 1.1 billion cubic meters.

Kaifeng Region Inspects Spring Planting Area and Quality
    The Kaifeng region of Henan Province is carrying out a major inspection and comparison campaign focused on comprehensively completing the planting plan and ensuring sowing quality. As of April 17, the region had sown 7.68 million mu of grain and cash crops, accounting for 85% of the spring planting task.

Hailun County Plans to Reclaim Another 370,000 Mu
    While sowing field crops, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, is also mobilizing labor to reclaim land on a large scale. This year, Hailun County plans to reclaim another 370,000 mu, in addition to the more than 230,000 mu reclaimed last autumn.

Expanding Multiple Cropping Area to Achieve Five Crops a Year with Four Harvests
    The Guojia Village Production Team of the Lingcheng Commune in Qufu County, Shandong, is actively promoting the method of "three crops two harvests, four crops three harvests, five crops four harvests" in one year to expand the multiple cropping area and increase the yield per unit area, thus solving the contradiction of oilseed, feed, vegetable and grain crops competing for land.
