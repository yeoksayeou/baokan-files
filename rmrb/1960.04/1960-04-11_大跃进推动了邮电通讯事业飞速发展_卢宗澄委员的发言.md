    The Great Leap Forward Promoted the Rapid Development of Postal and Telecommunications Services
    Speech by Committee Member Lu Zongcheng

    Since the Great Leap Forward, postal and telecommunications workers have carried forward the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Based on the spirit of combining indigenous and foreign methods and arming themselves, they launched a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, which enabled the postal and telecommunications services to move forward by leaps and bounds.

    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I was greatly encouraged after listening to the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. I express my heartfelt support for them. The reports of the two vice premiers pointed out that we are facing an excellent situation of leapfrog development in socialist construction. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are united, holding high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. We have already achieved the great victory of continuous Great Leap Forwards in 1958 and 1959. This year's plan presents an even more glorious and splendid prospect that can be fully realized. After completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, we have entered a new stage of sustained high-speed leap forward. We have the confidence to continue to leap forward and overfulfill the plan.

    I am a postal and telecommunications technician, and I would like to talk about my experience in conjunction with my work.

    The Great Leap Forward of 1958, with steel as the key link, drove the leapfrog development of all construction undertakings, and also drove the leapfrog development of postal and telecommunications. Under the shining light of the General Line, postal and telecommunications workers enthusiastically responded to the great call of the Party Central Committee to "establish a nationwide postal and telecommunications network dominated by modern tools that reaches out in all directions." Because postal and telecommunications extend from points to lines, from lines to surfaces, from cities to villages, and from inland to border areas, reaching out in all directions requires connectivity between all points, regardless of distance. Modernization requires mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. Achieving this is not simple, especially since the postal and telecommunications foundation left over from old China was very weak; it can be said to be poor and blank. However, under the leadership of the Party and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, postal and telecommunications workers broke down superstitions, liberated their minds, established the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and launched a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution on a nationwide scale. By promoting the spirit of self-reliance and implementing the policy of walking on two legs, the postal and telecommunications services took a step forward. Postal and telecommunications institutions in various provinces and cities, based on the spirit of combining indigenous and foreign methods and arming themselves, designed and manufactured equipment on their own. In a very short period of time, postal services created a batch of postal mechanization and semi-automation equipment, such as letter sorting machines, bundle packing machines, and ticket vending machines. The number of carrier telephone sets made locally in various places exceeded the total amount imported from abroad during the nine years from 1949 to 1957. The number of intra-county telephone lines erected in 1958 alone increased by 65% compared to the original total, enabling 97.8% of the people's communes and 70% of the management districts or production brigades across the country to have telephones, accelerating the realization of the requirements for telecommunications in the National Agricultural Development Program.

    What is worth mentioning here is that the Changli County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Hebei Province had no machine tools, no sufficient materials, and no technical personnel. They only had a few machine operators who had never seen carrier machines and some simple maintenance tools such as files and pliers. However, they put politics in command, were not afraid of difficulties, and if they didn't have foreign equipment, they used indigenous methods. If they didn't have ferrite, they used iron ore sand from the river to refine it themselves. Finally, they overcame the difficulties and made a single-channel carrier machine, which not only met the communication needs of the county but also supported the postal and telecommunications bureaus in the entire special district. This spirit of self-reliance and the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods is a manifestation of our conscious initiative in building socialism. Carrying forward this spirit can create more miracles in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The large-scale production of carrier machines by indigenous methods in various provinces not only solved the shortage of circuits at the time but also cultivated strength, enabling many provinces to move from indigenous to foreign and from small to large. For example, Gansu Province did not have very good conditions, but after using indigenous methods, it has now produced twelve-channel carrier machines that meet technical requirements in just one year.

    In addition, in order to eliminate heavy physical labor and improve labor productivity, the Beijing Post Office Transit Center began to develop the mechanization of loading and unloading mail from trains. They had no blueprints and no engineering and technical personnel; they only had an electrician and a few electric vehicle drivers. However, they relied on the masses and were self-reliant. They mobilized the masses, everyone offered suggestions, and they solved problems collectively. Within three days, the workers had put forward more than 300 suggestions, some even drawing diagrams and making models. If there were difficulties with materials, everyone thought of ways to solve them. In this way, everyone was united, relying on soaring enthusiasm and firm confidence. They learned if they didn't know and delved into things if they didn't understand. Through hard work and ingenuity, they brought collective wisdom into play. With the support of the post office machinery factory, they researched, designed, manufactured, and installed simultaneously. After more than a month of hard work, they made four mail conveying machines, one dual-purpose lifting tractor, and the first batch of containers for transporting mail. Preliminary tests showed good results. When manually unloading and loading mail from trains, four people could only load 16 bags per minute. With the conveyor, 48 bags could be loaded per minute, which is twice as efficient as manual labor. If a crane and container were used, four containers could be loaded per minute, totaling three tons and 144 bags of mail, which is eight times more efficient than manual loading and unloading and can save labor. This is even more effective for loading and unloading mail at railway intermediate stations, because trains at intermediate stations have shorter stopping times, the time for loading and unloading mail must be shortened, and mechanization can also ensure quality and safety. This also opened up a good start for the mechanization and automation of postal enterprises.

    The postal and telecommunications department has also made significant innovations in communications organization and management, that is, the "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration that began in early 1959. As mentioned above, the objective law of postal and telecommunications production work is from points to lines and from lines to surfaces. Therefore, "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration is a form of collaboration that is suitable for the characteristics of postal and telecommunications and is proposed through the mass production practice. It has a significant role in improving communication quality and labor productivity and promoting the comprehensive development of technical innovation and technical revolution. Now, "one-dragon" large-scale collaboration has developed from the collaboration of one circuit and one postal route to the collaboration of the entire network, and the collaboration between production operation and technical innovation, "one-dragon" and "group dragons." For example, Sichuan Province, based on the principle of "overall network planning, dragon as the foundation, hub leadership, and layer-by-layer guarantee," ensures that each special district, each enterprise, each department, and each postal route and circuit has annual plans, short-term arrangements, layer-by-layer implementation, segmented responsibility, fixed personnel, fixed tasks, and fixed time to ensure realization.

    The scientific research in the postal and telecommunications department also had a greater leap forward in 1959. This work has a wide scope and a large workload. Thanks to the leadership of the Party, the soaring enthusiasm and selfless labor of the masses, and through large-scale collaboration, results can be obtained in a relatively short period of time.

    Through the above examples, I deeply realize the correctness and greatness of the Party and Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the victory of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, as well as a whole set of policies of walking on two legs, putting politics in command, breaking down superstitions, liberating the mind, taking the mass line, adhering to continuous revolution, the incomparable power of socialism, and the incomparable superiority of the socialist system. The whole set of experiences in socialist construction in our country summarized in the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian are the products of Mao Zedong Thought and are invaluable treasures for building socialism in our country.

    In order to continue to leap forward and constantly push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a new upsurge, the scientific and technological work of the postal and telecommunications department in 1960 must strive to achieve mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, and long-distance communication multi-channeling on the basis of having already achieved a good start. Although these tasks are arduous, we have the leadership of the Party and the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought. As long as we adhere to putting politics in command and earnestly study and master Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp and apply Mao Zedong Thought, constantly carry out ideological revolution, and continue to hold high the red flags of Mao Zedong Thought and the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, we will surely continue to leap forward and will surely complete the twelve-year science and technology plan ahead of schedule.

    大跃进推动了邮电通讯事业飞速发展
    卢宗澄委员的发言
    大跃进以来，邮电职工发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，本着土洋并举和自己武装自己的精神，开展了群众性的技术革新和技术革命群众运动，使邮电事业大步向前迈进。主席、各位委员：
    听了李富春副总理、李先念副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告，使我感到莫大鼓舞。我谨予以衷心的拥护。两位副总理的报告指出了我们正面临着社会主义建设飞跃发展的大好形势。在党和毛主席的英明领导下，全国人民团结一致，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，已经取得了1958年和1959年连续两年大跃进的伟大胜利。今年计划又展现出一幅完全可以实现的更光辉灿烂的美景。我们在提前三年胜利完成了第二个五年计划主要指标之后，已经进入了一个高速度持续跃进的新阶段，我们有信心，一定能继续跃进并超额完成。
    我是一个邮电技术工作者，现就结合我的工作来谈谈我的体会。
    1958年大跃进，以钢为纲，带动了一切建设事业的飞跃发展，也带动了邮电通讯的飞跃发展。邮电职工在总路线的光辉照耀下，热烈地响应党中央所提出的“在全国范围内建立一个以现代化工具为主的、四通八达的邮电网”的伟大号召。由于邮电通信从点到线，从线到面，从城市到乡村，从内地到边疆，所以四通八达就要求无论远近，点点相通，而现代化就要求机械化，半机械化，自动化，半自动化。要做到这一点很不简单，尤其是旧中国遗留下来的邮电基础是很薄弱的，可以说是一穷二白。但是邮电职工在党的领导和毛泽东思想的指导下‘破除迷信，解放思想，树立敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，掀起了一个全国范围内大闹技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，发扬自力更生的精神，和贯彻两条腿走路的方针，使邮电事业向前迈进了一步。各省市的邮电机构本着土洋并举和自己武装自己的精神，纷纷自行设计制造，在很短时间内，邮政方面创造了一批邮政机械化和半自动化的设备，如信函分拣机、捆报机、售票机等。各地自制的载波电话机数量超过从1949年到1957年的九年期间所向国外进口的总和。在1958年一年内架设的县内电话线路也比原有总数增加65％，使全国97.8％的人民公社和70％的管理区或生产大队通了电话，加速了实现全国农业发展纲要对电信的要求。
    这中间值得一提的，是河北昌黎县邮电局没有机床，没有足够的器材，也没有技术人员。他们只有几个没有见过载波机的机务员和一些简单维护工具如锉刀、钳子等。但是他们政治挂帅，不怕困难，没有洋，就土法上马，没有铁氧体，就用河里的铁矿砂自己炼，终于克服了困难，制成单路载波机，不仅满足了本县通讯的需要，并且支援了全专区的各邮电局。这种自力更生的精神，土洋并举的作法正是我们建设社会主义的自觉的能动性的表现。发扬这种精神就可以在技术革新和技术革命运动中创造出更多的奇迹来。各省土法上马大搞载波机，一方面解决了当时电路的紧张，同时也培养了力量，使许多省份能由土到洋，由小到大。例如甘肃省条件并不太好，但经过土法上马，仅仅一年工夫，现在已经做出了符合技术要求的十二路载波机了。
    还有北京市邮局转运处为了消灭笨重的体力劳动和提高劳动生产率，在开始研制从火车装卸邮件机械化时，他们没有图纸，又没有工程技术人员，他们只有一个电工和几个电动车司机。但是他们依靠群众，自力更生。他们发动群众，人人献计，集体解决，三天之内职工就提出建议三百多件，有的还画出图样，制出了模型。材料有困难，也是大家想办法，就是这样大家结合在一起，凭着冲天干劲和坚定的信心，不会就学，不懂就钻，苦干加巧干，发挥了集体智慧，加上邮局机械工厂的支援，边研究，边设计，边制造，边安装，经过一个多月的苦战，制成了四台邮件传送机，一台两用起重拖拉车和第一批装运邮件的容器。经过初步试验，效果很好。从火车上用人工卸装邮件，四个人每分钟只能装十六袋，用传送机每分钟可以装四十八袋，比人工提高了二倍。若用起重车和容器，每分钟能装容器四个，合计邮件三吨一百四十四袋，比人工装卸提高效率八倍，并可节省人工。这对于铁路中间站的装卸邮件效用更大，因为中间站的列车停靠时间较短，装卸邮件的时间必须缩短，同时装卸采用机械化并可保证质量和安全。这并为邮政企业机械化自动化很好地开了一个端。
    邮电部门在通信组织管理方面也有了重大的革新，那就是在1959年初开展起来的一条龙大协作。由于上面已经说过，由点到线，由线到面的邮电生产工作的客观规律，所以一条龙大协作是适合邮电通信特点的协作形式，也是通过群众生产实践而提出的。它对提高通讯质量和劳动生产率，促进技术革新和技术革命的全面开展有着重大作用。现在一条龙大协作已发展到由一条电路，一条邮路的协作，发展为全网的协作，和生产操作和技术革新的一条龙和群龙之间的协作。如四川省本着“全网规划，龙为基础，枢纽领导，层层保证”的原则，做到每个专区，每个企业，每个部门，每条邮路、电路都有全年规划，短期安排，层层落实，分段负责，定人，定任务，定时间，保证实现。
    邮电部门科学研究方面在1959年也有了更大的跃进，这项工作范围较广，工作量较大，由于党的领导，群众的冲天干劲，忘我劳动，以及通过大协作，所以能在较短时间得有结果。
    通过上述这些事例，深深体会到党和毛主席英明领导的正确和伟大，总路线，大跃进，人民公社三个法宝的胜利和一整套两条腿走路的方针以及政治挂帅，破除迷信、解放思想，走群众路线，坚持不断革命的无比力量和社会主义制度的无比优越性。李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告所总结起来的我国社会主义建设的一整套经验是毛泽东思想的产物，是我国建设社会主义的无价之宝。
    为了继续跃进，把技术革新和技术革命运动不断推向新的高潮，邮电部门科学技术工作在1960年要在已经取得开门红的基础上，为实现机械化，半机械化，自动化，半自动化以及长途通信多路化而奋斗。虽这些任务是艰巨的，但是我们有党的领导，有毛泽东思想的武器，只要我们坚持政治挂帅，并认真学习和掌握毛泽东思想，紧紧地掌握和运用毛泽东思想，不断进行思想革命，继续高举毛泽东思想和总路线，大跃进，人民公社的红旗，我们一定能继续跃进，并一定能提前完成十二年科学技术规划。（附图片）
