Comrade Chairman, Esteemed Committee Members:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget. I also agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC.

Vice Premier Li’s report summarizes the experiences of our country's Great Leap Forward and puts forward our great goals, which are very educational for me and greatly inspire my revolutionary enthusiasm. I guarantee to resolutely implement them. Now, I will give a brief report to the conference on our commune's efforts to fight drought and win a bumper harvest in 1959, and our large-scale water conservancy projects. I am from the Dongduzhuang People's Commune in Fan County, Shandong Province. After the wheat harvest in 1959, we, like many brother communes in the province, encountered a severe drought that had not been seen for many years. From June to August, the total rainfall was less than 40 millimeters, and there was not a single soaking rain. As the saying goes, "Money can't buy a drought in May; continuous rain in June means a full stomach." When the crops needed rain the most, it didn't rain, and many crops withered and turned yellow, and some even shed their leaves. The vast number of cadres and commune members were very anxious and demanded to fight drought and ensure a good harvest. A few people with right-leaning ideas believed that "It's dry and barren; a little bit of watering won't help." They had no confidence in fighting the drought. Some people said, "Planting is up to man, but the harvest is up to heaven. If the heavens don't send rain, there's nothing man can do." In light of this situation, the commune Party committee analyzed the drought situation in detail and promptly conducted education on "man can conquer nature" for the commune members, launching a "speaking out and contending" debate to fight drought and win a bumper harvest. After the "speaking out and contending" debate on the two paths of "fighting drought to win a bumper harvest" versus "bowing to difficulties and watching production decline," the vast number of commune members recalled the tragic scenes of starvation, selling children, selling daughters, and fleeing famine during a drought in the pre-liberation period, which raised their awareness of fighting drought. Then, they organized small team cadres and commune member representatives to conduct on-site visits and comparisons between drought resistance and non-drought resistance. The cadres and commune members saw with their own eyes that the watered crops grew dark and strong, while the unwatered crops were short and yellow, which further increased their understanding of the importance of fighting drought to win a bumper harvest. At the same time, they realized that we have the correct leadership of the Party, a relatively good water source in the Majia River, and the experience of fighting drought for several years, which provided favorable conditions. As long as we resolutely listen to the Party and implement the spirit of the General Line, we will definitely be able to defeat the drought demon and win a bumper harvest. This established their determination and confidence in fighting the drought and put them into the anti-drought movement. The entire commune organized an army of more than 17,000 people to fight the drought. More than 200 temporary canteens were established in the fields. The secretary took the lead, and, together with the commune members, ate and lived in the fields. Big-character posters were brought to the fields to carry out a red flag emulation campaign to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced, between teams and between people, and to make all five-good commune member families red. Red flags were planted, pacesetters were established, and on-site visits were conducted, which quickly set off a vigorous high tide of the drought resistance movement. Our slogan was "Follow the sun by day and the moon by night; fight the drought until the dragon lowers its head, fight the drought until the grain is in our hands." After the vast number of commune members started working, there were no difficulties that could not be solved. If tools were broken, they repaired them themselves; if they didn't have them, they made them themselves. With the drought resistance struggle, a mass technical innovation and technical revolution emerged. Commune members successively modified and created more than 20 kinds of water lifting tools, such as windmills, water-powered waterwheels, and pedal waterwheels, which powerfully guaranteed the smooth progress of the drought resistance movement. At the same time, the spirit of communist cooperation was promoted between teams in the movement, which enabled backward teams to quickly catch up with advanced teams. For example, the Liuying production team had a slow pace of drought resistance due to its high terrain and distant water source. Under the leadership of the commune Party committee, the teams organized a support brigade of more than 2,000 people, who helped the Liuying team water all the land in one day. The commune members said, "Without the people's commune, this would have been impossible." After more than 20 days of hard work by all the cadres and the masses, the Majia River was dredged, two large canals and 352 large and small irrigation canals were built, and together with the more than 3,000 existing wells, the 85,000 mu of crops were generally watered two to three times. The vast number of commune members were full of energy in fighting the drought. They hoed the land and planted wheat during the day, and fought the drought and watered the land at night. More than 180 production teams planted red flags, and more than 2,500 cadres and commune members were named red flag pacesetters. After three months of fighting the drought, the commune's 74,300 mu of grain crops not only did not decrease in production, but also achieved an average yield of 503 jin per mu, winning a bumper harvest. The commune members said that in the past, heaven was in charge, but now the Communist Party and Chairman Mao lead us, and the farmers are in charge. The commune has a bumper harvest of grain. Not only have the commune members received enough rations, and kept enough feed and seeds, but they have also overfulfilled the annual national grain procurement task. More than 90% of the commune members have increased their income. The commune members of the Dongduzhuang production team have all increased their income. The mother of commune member Han Fugui said that in that year of drought, I fled famine and almost starved to death. This year is even drier than that year, but not only did I not have to flee famine, but I can't eat and use up all the food. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us to establish the people's commune, how could I have such a good life?

Our commune not only overcame the drought that had not been seen for many years and won a bumper harvest in 1959, but also sowed 75,000 mu of wheat quickly, well, and in large quantities, an increase of more than 20,000 mu compared to 1958. The 75,000 mu of wheat has all achieved the "five-izations": standardization, field ridging, improved varieties, base fertilizer application (applying base fertilizer), and pesticide application (seed soaking). This spring, we are fighting a big battle to care for the wheat seedlings. Most of the wheat fields have been watered one or two times, and an average of 5,000 jin of topdressing (local miscellaneous fertilizer) has been applied per mu. In addition, 250,000 jin of chemical fertilizer has been applied to all the commune's wheat fields. The wheat seedlings are growing very lush, which provides a full guarantee for a bumper harvest.

Based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's theory of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development, on the basis of the bumper harvest in the autumn of 1959, while conducting socialist and communist education among the entire population in the winter of 1959, we also launched a large-scale water conservancy movement with water as the key. Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line and inspired by the spirit of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, as well as through the practical education of the drought resistance struggle in the autumn of 1959, the vast number of commune members further realized the importance of rapidly realizing water conservancy and resolutely responded to the Party's call to make water the key to winter production. Under the leadership of the commune Party committee, a water conservancy army of more than 10,000 people was formed. A large-scale battle was fought throughout the winter and spring, resulting in the construction of more than 2,000 canals of five levels: main canals, branch canals, bucket canals, farm canals, and capillary canals. More than 320 large and small bridges and sluices were built, and two hydropower stations were built (but not yet completed). All 115,000 mu of land in the commune can now be irrigated by gravity flow. As long as there is sufficient water, it can be universally watered once every five days. Combined with the more than 3,000 existing wells, we can completely achieve a double guarantee whether it rains or not, ensuring a bumper harvest regardless of drought or flood. Combined with large-scale water conservancy, we unified planning, repaired roads and cultivated land sections, and prepared conditions for the use of mechanized farming. I believe that the tasks put forward in Vice Premier Li's report can be overfulfilled by the people of the whole country with full vigor. We will resolutely respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, take grain as the key, and realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

Long live the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune!

    过去天作主　如今人当家
    曾广福委员介绍山东范县董杜庄人民公社抗旱情况主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告。并同意陈叔通副主席关于政协全国委员会常委会的工作报告。
    李副总理的报告，总结了我国大跃进的经验，提出我们伟大的奋斗目标，对我教育很大，更加鼓舞了我的革命干劲，我保证坚决贯彻执行。现在把我社1959年抗旱夺丰收和大搞水利的情况，向大会作简要的汇报。我在山东省范县董杜庄人民公社，1959年麦收后，我们与全省许多兄弟社一样，遇到了多年没有过的严重旱灾。从6月到8月总共降雨不到四十公厘，没下过一次透地雨。俗话说：“有钱难买5月旱，6月连阴吃饱饭”。庄稼正需要雨的时候，不下雨，很多庄稼旱的枯黄，有的旱的落叶。广大干部、社员非常着急，要求抗旱保收，少数有右倾思想的人，认为“天旱地干，浇一星半点的不顶事。”对抗旱没有信心，有人说：“种在人，收在天，老天不下雨，人是无办法。”公社党委根据这种情况，详细的分析了旱情，及时向社员进行了人定胜天的教育，发动全党全民开展了抗旱夺丰收的鸣放辩论。广大社员经过“究竟抗旱夺丰收呢？还是向困难低头，看着减产”的两条道路的鸣放辩论；回忆了解放前某年旱灾时的饿死人、卖儿、卖女、逃荒要饭的凄惨景象，提高了对抗旱的认识。接着组织小队干部和社员代表进行了抗旱和不抗旱的现场参观对比，干部社员亲眼看到水浇的庄稼长的又黑又壮，没浇水的又矮又黄，更进一步认识到抗旱夺丰收的重要意义，同时认识到，我们有党的正确领导，有马颊河比较好的水源，有几年来抗旱斗争的经验等有利条件，只要坚决听党的话贯彻总路线的精神，一定能够战胜旱魔，夺得丰收，树立了抗旱的决心和信心，投入了抗旱运动。全社组织了一万七千多人的抗旱大军，在田间建立了二百多个临时食堂，书记挂帅，同社员一起、吃住在田间，实行大字报到田，开展了学先进、赶先进、超先进的队与队之间，人与人之间和五好社员全家红的红旗竞赛运动。插红旗，立标兵，现场参观，很快掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗旱运动高潮，我们的口号是“白天跟着太阳走，夜晚跟着月亮转，抗旱抗到龙低头，抗旱抗到粮到手”。广大社员干起来之后，没有解决不了的困难，工具坏了自己修理，没有就自己制造，随着抗旱斗争，又出现了群众性的技术革新和技术革命，社员们先后改制和创造了二十多种提水工具，如：风力水车，水力水车，脚蹬水车等。有力的保证了抗旱运动的顺利进行。同时在运动中队与队之间发扬了共产主义的协作精神，使落后队迅速赶上了先进队，如：刘营生产队，因地高水远，抗旱进度很慢，各队在社党委领导下，组织了二千多人的支援大队，一天就帮助刘营队浇完了地，社员说：“没有人民公社，是根本办不到的”。经过全体干、群二十多天的奋战，疏通了马颊河，修筑了大干渠两条，大小灌溉渠三百五十二条，连同原有的三千多眼水井，使八万五千亩农作物普遍浇了二至三遍水。广大社员们在抗旱中干劲冲天，白天锄地种麦，夜晚抗旱浇水，先后有一百八十多个生产小队插上了红旗，二千五百多名干部社员被评为红旗标兵，经过三个月的抗旱斗争，全社七万四千三百多亩粮食作物，不但没有减产，而且达到了平均亩产五百零三斤，夺得了大丰收。社员们说，过去天作主，现在共产党毛主席领导咱们，种地人作主了，全社粮食大丰收，不仅社员都分到了足够的口粮，留足了饲料和种子，而且超额完成了全年国家粮食的征购任务。全社90％以上的社员，都增加了收入，董杜庄生产队的社员百分之百的增加了收入。社员韩富贵的母亲说，那年旱天，我逃荒要饭，差一点饿死，这比那年更旱，不但没用逃荒要饭，而且吃不了用不完，不是共产党、毛主席领导咱办人民公社，俺那有这样的好日子。
    我社不但战胜了多年没有的旱灾，夺得了1959年的大丰收，而且又多又快又好的播种了七万五千亩小麦，比1958年增种二万多亩。七万五千亩小麦都达到了五化：规格化、畦田化、良种化、基肥（施底肥）化、农药（浸种）化。今春大战小麦返青关，大部分麦田浇过一二遍水，平均每亩已施追肥（土杂肥）五千斤，另外全社麦田追施化肥二十五万斤，麦苗长的很肥壮，这给丰收有了充分保证。
    我们根据毛主席不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的精神，在1959年秋季大丰收的基础上，1959年冬季在全民进行社会主义共产主义教育的同时，又开展了以水为纲的大搞水利运动，广大社员在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在党的八届八中全会决议精神的鼓舞下，以及经过1959年秋季抗旱斗争的实际教育，进一步认识了迅速实现水利化的重要意义，坚决的响应了党提出的以水为纲的冬季生产号召，在社党委的领导下组成了一万多人的水利大军，大战了一冬春共修五级渠道干渠、支渠、斗渠、农渠、毛渠二千多条，修建了大小桥闸三百二十多座，建水电站二个（还没完工），全社十一万五千亩土地，全部可以自流灌溉，只要水充足，五天能够普浇一遍，加上原有的三千多眼井，完全作到有雨无雨双保险，旱涝保丰收，结合大搞水利，统一规划，修整了道路和耕作地段，为使用机耕准备了条件。我认为，李副总理报告提出的任务，全国人民鼓足干劲，一定能超额完成。我们坚决响应党中央、毛主席的伟大号召，以粮为纲，实现农林牧副渔更大更好更全面的跃进。
    总路线、大跃进、人民公社万岁！
