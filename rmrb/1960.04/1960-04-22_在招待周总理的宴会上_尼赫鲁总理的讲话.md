Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 20th: The full text of Prime Minister Nehru's speech at the banquet held tonight in honor of Premier Zhou Enlai:

Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen:

We are gathered here today to receive the Chinese Premier, not only in his personal capacity but also as a representative of a great nation, as our honored guest. We have had the honor and pleasure of welcoming him to our country several times before. It is a matter of great satisfaction to us that two great Asian nations, India and China, are establishing friendly ties in this era, just as they have been friendly for generations in the past. In our view, this friendship and cooperation is a guarantee of peace in Asia. Therefore, this friendship with our great neighbor has become a cornerstone of Indian policy.

However, we meet today under different circumstances, at a time when serious differences have unfortunately arisen between us. This is unfortunate for all of us, and I believe for the whole world. It is a double misfortune for us Indians, because for a long time we have been accustomed to advocating peace and peaceful methods, and to regard war as a terrible thing incompatible with civilized nations. We are not only opposed to war, but also to the so-called "Cold War," because it is a method of hatred and violence. We have been striving to follow—in our limited and imperfect way—the teachings of two great sons of India, Buddha and Gandhi.

It is a strange and very troubling thing for us that the development of events has challenged the very foundation of our thinking, and that we are concerned about the dangers along the great Himalayas—which we have loved for thousands of years and which have been the sentinel guarding and inspiring our people—on our peaceful border.

Sir, you have come here at this critical moment, and we welcome your visit. Many things have happened that have caused pain to our people, many things have been done that we think should be eliminated, and many things have been said that are best left unsaid. We must do our best to seek correct and peaceful solutions to the problems that have arisen. This solution must be in harmony with the dignity and self-respect of each country, and in line with the greater cause of peace in Asia and the world. We have raised the banner of peace before other nations, and we cannot, and the world cannot, allow us to let this banner slip from our hands.

We are meeting here at a difficult and critical moment in world history and in the relationship between ourselves. The history of thousands of years of two great ancient civilizations is a witness to our meeting, and the hopes of hundreds of millions of people for a better future are combined with our efforts. Let us pray that we are successful, so that we can be true to our past and the future that calls to us. On our part, Mr. Prime Minister, I can assure you that we will do our best to ensure that our efforts lead to success and to the maintenance of peace consistent with the dignity and self-respect of our two great nations. As the Buddha said, true victory is the victory of all, which contains no defeat.

I believe you are equally eager for peace and cooperation, and I also believe that through our joint efforts, we will not only halt this unpleasant deterioration in relations between our two countries, but will also take steps to improve this relationship.

In view of this noble purpose, I welcome you, Prime Minister, and your colleagues, and ask you to raise your glasses to your health and the success of our efforts to seek peace.

### 在招待周总理的宴会上  尼赫鲁总理的讲话

    在招待周总理的宴会上
    尼赫鲁总理的讲话
    新华社新德里20日电　尼赫鲁总理今晚在为周恩来总理举行的宴会上的讲话全文：阁下，女士们和先生们：
    我们今天在这里聚会是为了招待中国总理，他不但是以他个人的身份而且是作为一个伟大的国家的代表来做我们的尊敬的客人的。我们以前曾几次荣幸地、愉快地在我国欢迎他。亚洲两个伟大的国家印度和中国，在目前这个时代在建立友谊的联系，就像在过去世世代代一直友好相处一样，这是一件使我们感到深为满意的事。在我们看来，这种友谊和合作是亚洲和平的一个保证。因此，这种同我们这个伟大的邻邦的友谊已经成为印度政策的基石。
    但是，我们今天是在不同的情况下在我们之间不幸发生了严重分歧的时候会晤的。这是我们大家的不幸，而且我相信也是全世界的不幸。这对我们印度人是一个双重的不幸，因为长久以来，我们一直惯于主张和平和和平方法，把战争看作是一种同文明国家不相称的恐怖的东西。我们不但反对战争，而且还反对所谓“冷战”，因为这是仇恨和暴力的方法。我们一直努力遵循——以我们的有限和不完善的方式遵循——印度的两个伟大的儿子佛和甘地的教导。
    事态发展竟然使得我们的想法的基础本身受到挑战，而使我们忧虑沿着伟大的喜马拉雅山——千万年来我们一直热爱它，它一直是守卫和鼓舞我国人民的岗哨——的我们和平边境上的危险，这对我们说来是一件奇怪的事，也是一件令人感到非常烦恼的事。
    先生，您在这个极关重要的时刻来到了这里，我们欢迎您的访问。已经发生了许多使我国人民感到痛苦的事情，已经做了许多我们认为应该加以消除的事情，已经说了许多最好不说的话。我们必须尽我们最大的力量来寻求解决已经产生的问题的正确的、和平的办法。这种解决办法必须是同每个国家的尊严和自尊心协调的，并且是同亚洲和世界和平这种更大的事业一致的。我们已经在其他国家面前举起了和平的旗帜，我们不能、而且全世界也不能听任我们让这面旗帜从我们的手中滑掉。
    我们是在世界历史和我们自己之间的关系中的一个困难的、极关重要的时刻在这里会晤的。两个伟大古老的文明国家的几千年的历史是我们的会晤的见证，亿万人对更美好的未来所抱的希望是同我们的努力结合在一起的。让我们祈求我们得到成功，以便我们能够忠于我们的这种过去和向我们招唤的未来。在我们方面，总理先生，我可以向您保证，我们将尽我们最大的力量来使我们的努力能够导致成功和导致维护符合我们两个大国的尊严和自尊心的和平。如佛所说的，真正的胜利是不包含失败的所有的人的胜利。
    我认为您同样渴望和平和合作，我还认为在我们共同努力之下，我们不仅将制止我们两国关系恶化这种不愉快的事情，而且将采取步骤来改善这种关系。
    鉴于这个崇高的目的，我欢迎您，总理先生，以及您的同事们，并要求大家为您的健康和我们寻求和平的努力的成功干杯。
