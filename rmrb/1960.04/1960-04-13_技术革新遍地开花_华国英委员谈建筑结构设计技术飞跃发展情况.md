Technical Innovation Blossoms Everywhere
Hua Guoying, Member of the CPPCC National Committee, Speaks on the Leap-Forward Development of Architectural Structure Design Technology

Chairman, esteemed members:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s "Report on the Draft 1960 National Economic Plan," Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s "Report on the 1959 National Financial Statement and the Draft 1960 National Budget," and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong’s "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Third CPPCC National Committee." I will actively strive to realize the various tasks proposed in these reports for 1960.

Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the radiant illumination of the General Line, today, on the vast and magnificent land of our great motherland, a surging, nationwide mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is unfolding. The situation is infinitely positive everywhere, and every front is a sea of red. We are full of confidence and will fight to achieve a continued, comprehensive, and even greater leap forward in the national economy in 1960.

I am an architectural designer. I would now like to report to the assembly on some of what I know about the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the architectural design sector. Any inaccuracies are subject to your corrections.

During the wave of continuous great leaps forward in the national economy over the past two years, architectural design work, like all other work nationwide, has experienced a leap-forward development. It has created and universally adopted a complete set of fast, high-quality design methods, generally shortening design cycles by more than half, with over 90% of designs being of excellent quality. The Great Hall of the People in Beijing, with its exquisite level of craftsmanship, is first-class in the world. The rapid construction of the Ten Great Projects of Beijing, including the Great Hall, is an outstanding example of fast, high-quality design and solid proof of the overall great leap forward in the national economy.

Through the training of the Great Leap Forward, the technical level of architectural design work has improved significantly. We are now able to independently undertake the design tasks of various large-scale industrial and mining enterprises and advanced, complex civil buildings. Now, I will discuss the leap-forward development and the tremendous achievements in architectural structure design.

In terms of structural design theory, we have caught up with or surpassed European and American capitalist countries in many areas. The advanced method of calculation based on limit states has been widely adopted in design. Using this method, the stress condition of structures can be made more realistic and reasonable. Compared to the allowable stress calculation method still used in Western countries, it can save about 26% of steel. We have not only mastered the theories of thin-shell structures and seismic structures, but also have made innovations in calculation methods. Thin-shell structures, because they fully utilize the performance of structural materials, can be made very thin. Currently, even the most economical design of beam-slab structures has a converted thickness of about eight to ten centimeters, while thin-shell structures generally only require five centimeters. This type of structure can create large-span roofs, meeting the needs of public buildings with large gatherings of people, such as gymnasiums. In the past two years, our country has done a lot of work in this area. For example, the simple calculation method for thin shells proposed by the China Academy of Building Research of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has been praised by foreign thin-shell experts. We have made even faster progress in prefabricated reinforced concrete. Now, most single-story reinforced concrete factory buildings basically use prefabricated structures entirely. Even the main factory buildings of thermal power plants, which have complex structures, have adopted prefabricated structures. High-rise civil buildings, such as the 13-story Beijing Minzu Hotel already in use and the 15-story Civil Aviation Office Building under construction, all use prefabricated structures, greatly shortening the construction period. Projects that originally took a year and a half to complete can now be completed in just a few dozen days. In addition, we have used prefabricated reinforced concrete structures in structures such as 45-meter-high cooling towers, which is rare abroad. We have also achieved great achievements in new technologies. Prestressed concrete structures, with their series of advantages such as light weight, material savings, good stiffness, crack resistance, and durability, have been widely used in engineering. Last year, a building with a span of 60 meters was built. Overlapping prestressed concrete crane beams were used in industrial factory buildings. The largest prestressed concrete crane beam has a span of 12 meters and can bear a crane weighing 150 tons, which is currently one of the heavier types. In addition, we have also built a prestressed reinforced concrete gas tank water storage pool with a diameter of 39.5 meters, while such structures are mostly made of steel abroad. Thin-shell structures have also begun to be widely used in our country. For example, the central hall of the new Beijing Railway Station uses a 35-meter square reinforced concrete hyperbolic paraboloid thin shell, which reduces the weight by 45%, saves steel by 52%, and saves cement by 42% compared with beam-slab structures. The coating and firing workshop of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory uses a long thin shell with a span of 30 meters. Even the Shunde County People's Hall in Guangdong Province, with a span of 55 meters, only 5 meters smaller than the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, and with 5,000 seats, although designed by the county's designers with the assistance of the South China Institute of Technology, that a county can build such a large-scale and technically complex building fully reflects the heroic spirit of the liberated Chinese people. This is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a product of the daring, speaking, and doing communist style. The world's lightest and most novel structure, the suspension roof structure, has also begun to be built in our country. The large gymnasium being built in Beijing, with a diameter of 94 meters, uses this type of roof structure, which looks like a bicycle wheel laid on its side, saving 67% of the steel compared to using a steel structure. In addition to Beijing, Shenyang, Zhengzhou, and other places are currently preparing to use suspension roof structures. These buildings, which demonstrate our country's great achievements in advanced technology, will soon stand tall one by one across the country.

This year, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the architectural design sector, in terms of design methods, focuses on "Five-izations" (standardization of design, chart-ization of calculations and electrification of calculation tools, assembly-ization of drawing, manual-ization of materials, and multi-skilling and mechanization of professional tools) to improve labor productivity; in terms of design content, it focuses on "Six News" (new structural technologies, new architectural styles, new processes, new equipment, new building materials, and new design theories) to improve technical levels. At present, it revolves around the central link of universally promoting fast and high-quality design and reducing the self-weight of buildings. Below, I will express some immature opinions on the significance and ways of reducing the self-weight of buildings.

Reducing the self-weight of buildings is of great significance to the national economy. First, it can save a large amount of building materials. If the roof is lighter, the beams and columns can be made smaller; if the upper structure is lighter, the foundation will be reduced accordingly. This can greatly save building materials. Second, it can reduce the amount of transportation and solve the contradiction of insufficient transportation capacity. If the weight of buildings can be reduced by 10%, just taking the tasks undertaken by the Ministry of Construction Engineering this year as an example, it can save 8 million to 10 million tons of materials. Reducing the transportation of these materials can free up 1.6 million to 2 million trips by 5-ton trucks, or 270,000 to 330,000 railway cars. In addition, reducing the self-weight of structures will greatly reduce the costs and labor involved in manufacturing, transporting, and installing these components. At the same time, due to the reduction in the weight of components, larger-sized components can be lifted using lifting equipment with the same lifting capacity, thereby speeding up construction. In areas with poorer conditions, small local machinery and a combination of indigenous and foreign small and medium-sized machinery can be used for hoisting, which promotes the development of prefabricated structures and accelerates the process of realizing the industrialization of construction in our country. Therefore, under the premise of ensuring quality, reducing the self-weight of buildings is an important measure for the construction industry to implement the General Line and complete construction and installation tasks in a faster, better, and more economical way, and it is also an important part of the technical revolution in the construction industry.

There are broad ways to reduce the self-weight of buildings, roughly in these areas: First, adopt high-strength, lightweight materials. For example, use high-strength steel, high-grade cement, steel wire mesh cement, gypsum slag cement, wet-rolled slag concrete, lightweight large bricks, lightweight aggregates, various fiberboards, mineral wool, gypsum products, and other high-strength, lightweight materials and local materials. Another way to reduce the self-weight of buildings is to adopt high-efficiency structural forms. This includes replacing solid components with hollow components, replacing ordinary reinforced concrete with prestressed concrete, and replacing ordinary beam-slab planar structures with spatial structures, such as thin shells and suspension structures. The third way is to improve the structural layout plan. For example, merge some separate small factory buildings with similar and related production natures into one large factory building; appropriately enlarge the column grid size; adopt open-air or semi-open-air arrangements for certain process equipment; appropriately reduce the floor height in civil buildings; and adopt a load-bearing wall structure scheme under certain conditions.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we have begun to pay attention to reducing the self-weight of buildings, and have done a lot of work and achieved certain results. For example, the processing workshop of the Beijing Equipment Factory of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, designed by the Beijing Industrial Construction Design Institute, adopted new materials such as high-grade concrete and foam silicate, and the weight of the entire workshop was reduced by 45% compared to general single-story factory buildings. Recently, Beijing successfully hoisted a five-story residential building using large reinforced concrete panels, which is 53% lighter than general mixed structures. The Beijing Gymnasium currently under construction uses a 94-meter diameter suspension structure, which is half the weight of a thin shell. These examples all show that we have made great improvements in technical level, accumulated a lot of experience, and mastered many advanced technologies in recent years. We also have a certain material foundation in mechanical installation equipment. New materials have also greatly developed. All of this provides us with good conditions for further reducing the self-weight of buildings in the future.

However, at the same time, there are still some difficulties. For example, materials cannot meet the needs for the time being, such as high-strength steel wire and high-grade cement. Secondly, the production of new materials such as silicate, slag wool, and asbestos products also needs to catch up. Currently, various places are preparing to build new material factories, hoping to speed up the construction of these factories and strive to produce in advance to meet the needs of all parties. While strengthening the basic construction of new materials, we should also pay attention to continuously reforming and improving the production of existing materials. Adopt a two-pronged approach.

At present, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the entire architectural design sector, under the strong leadership of the Party, adheres to putting politics in command, resolutely follows the mass line, boldly mobilizes the masses, and combines it with the movement of studying Marxist-Leninist theories and Mao Zedong's works. It is constantly consolidating, developing, and improving. We firmly believe that we will be able to complete this year's architectural design tasks more, faster, better, and more economically, and accelerate catching up with the world's advanced technical level.

    技术革新遍地开花
    华国英委员谈建筑结构设计技术飞跃发展情况主席团、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理所作的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”、李先念副总理所作的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”、陈叔通副主席所作的“中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”，并为实现这些报告中所提出的1960年的各项任务而积极努力。
    在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，今天，在我们伟大祖国的万里江山上，出现了一个全民性的波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动的沸腾景象，处处形势无限好，条条战线一片红，我们满怀信心地为争取1960年国民经济继续全面的更好的跃进而奋斗。
    我是一个建筑设计工作者，现在就我所知道的建筑设计部门开展技术革新和技术革命运动中的若干情况向大会汇报，不妥之处，请大家指正。
    在过去两年国民经济连续大跃进的浪潮中，建筑设计工作和全国各项工作一样，有着飞跃的发展，创造并普遍地采用了快速优质的一整套设计方法，一般缩短设计周期一半以上，设计质量90％以上是优良的。北京的人民大会堂，其精美程度在世界上也是第一流的，包括它在内的北京十大工程的快速建成，是快速优质设计的杰出的例证，也是整个国民经济大跃进的铁的例证。
    通过大跃进的锻炼，建筑设计工作的技术水平又有很大的提高，我们已能独立地承担各种大型的工矿企业和高级的复杂的民用建筑设计任务。现在我谈一谈在建筑结构设计方面的飞跃发展情况与获得的巨大成就。
    在结构设计理论上，很多方面我们已经赶上或超过了欧美资本主义国家，在设计中普遍采用了先进的按极限状态计算的方法。采用这种方法，可以使结构的受力情况更加切实合理，与西方国家还在采用的按容许应力计算的方法相比，可节约钢材26％左右。对薄壳结构和抗振结构理论，我们不仅已经掌握，而且在计算方法上还有所创造。薄壳结构，由于它充分发挥了结构材料的性能，可以做得很薄，目前梁板式结构，即使是最经济的设计，折算厚度也在八至十厘米左右，而薄壳结构一般只要五厘米。这种结构可以做大跨度屋盖，满足体育馆等有大量群众集会的公共建筑在使用上的要求。这两年，我国在这方面做了不少工作。例如建筑工程部建筑科学研究院提出的薄壳简捷计算方法，曾受到国外薄壳专家的赞誉。在装配式钢筋混凝土方面，我们的进展更快。现在一般的单层钢筋混凝土厂房，基本上已经全部采用装配式结构，连结构复杂的热电站主厂房也已采用了装配式结构。高层的民用建筑如目前已经使用的北京民族饭店十三层大楼，正在施工的十五层民航办公大楼，都采用了装配式结构，使施工期限大大缩短，原来要一年半载才能完成的工程，现在只要几十天就完成了。此外在构筑物中，如四十五米高的冷却塔，我们采用了装配式钢筋混凝土结构，这在国外也是很少见的。在新技术方面我们同样取得了很大的成就，予应力混凝土结构，由于它具有自重轻、材料省、刚度好、抗裂性和耐久性高等一系列优点，已经在工程中采用得很普遍。去年曾经修建了一个跨度为六十米的建筑，并且在工业厂房中采用了迭合式予应力混凝土吊车梁，最大的予应力混凝土吊车梁跨度为十二米，能承担起重量为一百五十吨的吊车，这是目前吨位较大的一种。此外，我们还修建了一座直径为三十九点五米的予应力钢筋混凝土煤气罐储水池，而这种结构在国外多是采用钢结构的。薄壳结构在我国也开始大量采用，例如北京新车站中央大厅就采用了三十五米见方的钢筋混凝土双曲扁薄壳，与梁板式结构相比，重量减轻45％，钢材节省52％，水泥节省42％；西安人民搪瓷厂的涂烧车间采用了跨度为三十米的长薄壳；甚至像广东省顺德县人民会堂，跨度达五十五米，只比北京人民大会堂小五米，有五千个座位，这个工程虽然是该县设计人员在华南工学院协助下设计的，但一个县居然能建成这样规模宏大、技术复杂的建筑物，充分反映了解放了的中国人民的英勇气质，这是毛泽东思想的胜利，是敢想、敢说、敢干共产主义风格的产物。世界上目前最轻巧的新颖结构——悬索屋盖结构，在我国也已开始修建，北京正在兴建的大型体育馆，直径达九十四米，就是采用这种像自行车轮子横放似的屋盖结构，比采用钢结构节约了67％的钢材。除了北京以外，在沈阳、郑州等地，目前都在准备采用悬索屋盖结构，这些显示我国在先进技术上已经取得很大成就的建筑物不久都将在全国一座座地耸立起来。
    今年，建筑设计部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，在设计方法上，以“五化”（设计标准化、计算图表化和计算工具电气化、制图装配化、资料手册化、工具专业多能化和机械化）为内容，以提高劳动生产率；设计内容上以“六新”（新的结构技术、新的建筑风格、新的工艺、新的设备、新的建筑材料、新的设计理论）为内容，以提高技术水平。在目前，围绕着普遍推行快速优质设计和减轻建筑物的自重这个中心环节来进行。下面我仅就减轻建筑物自重的意义和途径，发表一些不成熟的意见。
    减轻建筑物自重对国民经济有很大意义。首先是可以节约大量建筑材料。屋盖轻了，梁、柱就可以做得小一些；上层结构轻了，基础也就相应地减少。这样就可以大大节约建筑材料。其次是可以减少运输量，解决运输力量不足的矛盾。如果能减轻建筑物重量10％，单拿建筑工程部今年承担的任务来说，就可以节约八百至一千万吨材料，少运这些材料，可以腾出五吨的载重汽车一百六十至二百万辆次，或二十七至三十三万节火车皮。此外，减轻结构自重，在制造、搬运和安装这些构件时的费用和劳动量也将大大降低。同时，由于构件重量的减轻，利用同样起重能力的吊装设备，就可以吊起尺寸更大的构件，从而加快施工速度。而在条件较差的地区也可以利用土的小机械和土洋结合的中小型机械来吊装，这就促进装配式结构的发展，加快我国实现建筑工业化的进程。因此，在保证质量的前提下，减轻建筑物自重是建筑业贯彻总路线、多快好省地完成建筑安装任务的一项重要措施，也是建筑工业技术革命的一项重要内容。
    减轻建筑物自重有着广阔的途径，大致说来有这几方面：一是采用高强轻质材料。例如采用高强度钢材、高标号水泥、钢丝网水泥、石膏矿碴水泥、湿辗矿碴混凝土、轻质大砖、轻质骨料、多种纤维板、矿物棉、石膏制品等等高强轻质材料和地方材料。减轻建筑物自重的另一个途径是采用高效能的结构型式。其中包括以空心构件代替实心构件，以予应力混凝土代替普通钢筋混凝土，以及以空间结构，如薄壳、悬索等代替普通梁板平面结构。第三个途径是改进结构的布置方案。例如，把一些生产性质相类似和相近的单独小厂房合并成一个大厂房；适当地放大柱网尺寸；将某些工艺设备采用露天或半露天布置；在民用建筑中适当地降低层高；在一定的条件下采用横墙承重结构方案等。
    1958年大跃进以来，我们已经开始注意减轻建筑物的自重，也做了不少工作，并取得了一定成绩。如北京工业建设设计院设计的邮电部北京器材厂加工车间，采用了高标号混凝土和泡沫硅酸盐等新材料，整个车间的重量就比一般单层厂房减轻了45％。最近北京成功地吊装了一个采用钢筋混凝土大型板材的五层住宅，比一般混合结构重量轻53％。目前正在施工的北京体育馆，采用了直径九十四米的悬索结构，重量比薄壳还轻一半。这些例子都说明这几年来我们在技术水平上有了很大的提高，积累了不少经验，掌握了许多先进技术。在机械安装设备等方面，也具备了一定的物质基础。新材料也有很大的发展。这一切，都为我们今后进一步减轻建筑物自重提供了良好的条件。
    但是，与此同时，也还存在着一些困难。比如材料一时还不能满足需要，如高强度钢丝，高标号水泥等。其次是新材料如硅酸盐、矿渣棉、石棉制品等的生产，也需要迎头赶上。目前各地都在筹建新材料厂，希望能加快这方面的建设速度，争取提前生产，以满足各方面的需要。在加强新材料基本建设的同时，还应该注意不断改革和提高现有材料的生产。采取两条腿走路的方针。
    目前，整个建筑设计部门的技术革新与技术革命运动，在党的坚强领导下，坚持政治挂帅，坚决走群众路线，放手发动群众，并与学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东著作的运动结合起来，在不断地巩固、发展和提高，我们坚信，一定能够更多更快更好更省地完成今年的建筑设计任务，并加速赶上世界先进技术水平。
