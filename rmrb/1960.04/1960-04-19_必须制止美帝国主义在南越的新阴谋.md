We Must Stop the New Conspiracy of U.S. Imperialism in South Vietnam
Commentator of This Newspaper

On April 16, Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent a telegram to the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference (Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd) regarding the agreement reached between the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique of South Vietnam to increase the military personnel of the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group," issuing an urgent appeal. He requested the two chairmen to instruct the International Commission for Vietnam to reject the illegal demand of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to increase the military personnel of the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group." General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, also sent a telegram to Ansari, Chairman of the International Commission for Vietnam, on April 15, requesting the International Commission to suggest to the South Vietnamese authorities that they dissolve the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" and its organizations and withdraw them from South Vietnam. Both telegrams from Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong and Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap emphasized that the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, using the pretext of replacing French military instructors in South Vietnam, are expanding the military personnel of the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" in South Vietnam in a very insidious conspiracy, a blatant act of sabotaging the Geneva Accords, and a very open provocation by the United States in Indochina. Both telegrams clearly pointed out that the current situation is very urgent. If this conspiracy of U.S. imperialism is not stopped in time, the result will be a comprehensive destruction of the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, a serious crisis for the consolidation of peace in Vietnam and the realization of peaceful reunification, and a serious threat to the peace and security of Indochina and Southeast Asian countries.

The presence of the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" in South Vietnam is fundamentally illegal. This "advisory group" was originally a tool for U.S. imperialism to assist French colonialists in carrying out wars of aggression against the countries of Indochina. The 1954 Geneva Accords on ending the war in Indochina and restoring peace in Indochina clearly stipulated that the French "Expeditionary Force" withdraw from Vietnam, and that foreign troops and military personnel are absolutely not allowed to enter Vietnam. Article 16 of the Geneva Accords stipulates that "the introduction into Vietnam of any reinforcement in the form of troops and military personnel is prohibited." Paragraph 4 of the final declaration of the Geneva Accords also stipulates: "The introduction into Vietnam of foreign troops and military personnel as well as all kinds of arms and munitions is prohibited." Since the Geneva Accords have such clear provisions, and since France, the main initiator of the Indochina war, has withdrawn its invading troops from Vietnam in accordance with the Geneva Accords, then what reason does the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group," which once served as an accomplice of the French colonialists, have to remain in South Vietnam? Obviously, the issue today is not whether to allow increases or decreases in the personnel of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, but that it is absolutely not allowed to remain in South Vietnam any longer.

U.S. imperialism, risking the great danger of destroying the Geneva Accords, refuses to withdraw the military advisory group from South Vietnam because it has ulterior motives. When the United States initially established this military advisory group to assist the French colonialists in waging wars of aggression, it intended to strengthen its intervention in the Indochina region, gradually squeeze out French influence, replace France's colonial position, and contain and undermine the national independence and liberation movements of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. After the signing of the Geneva Accords and the restoration of peace in Indochina, U.S. imperialism has tried its best to use this institution as an important tool for it to undermine the Geneva Accords and turn South Vietnam into its colony and military base.

Since the U.S. Military Advisory Group has remained in South Vietnam, the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the just public opinion of Asia and the world have repeatedly protested against the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism. Until recently, the Liaison Representative of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army wrote to the International Commission, condemning the United States for using the U.S. Military Advisory Group as an institution to carry out criminal activities that undermine the Geneva Accords. However, U.S. imperialism has turned a deaf ear and has intensified its efforts to continuously expand the size of the advisory group. When the 1954 Geneva Accords were signed, the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" had only 200 people, including 20 senior officers, but today it has increased to 2,000 people, including 280 senior officers. For the past five years, the U.S. Military Advisory Group has been doing evil, becoming a powerful tool for the United States to divide Vietnam and a supreme emperor who issues orders in South Vietnam. It has enormous powers, from training troops and mobilizing troops to reviewing South Vietnam's "defense" budget, and firmly controls the puppet army of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. From the "Ministry of Defense," "General Staff Headquarters," and "Headquarters" of various services and arms of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, to the military regions, armies, divisions, various military schools, and various strategic construction project sites, and even some military warehouses, there are personnel from the U.S. Military Advisory Group operating them. Recently, this advisory group has also established branches in some important towns. What is especially intolerable is that the U.S. Military Advisory Group has also participated in planning, commanding, and directly participating in the "sweeps" by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to massacre former resistance personnel and the broad masses of patriotic people in South Vietnam. For example, U.S. General Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Chambers participated in the "sweep" in the southwest; Colonel Clay and Lieutenant Colonel Leicester participated in the "sweep" in the southeast; and Colonel Butler participated in the "sweep" by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in the provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai. The U.S. military has burned, killed, looted, and raped in South Vietnam, causing the safety of the lives of the South Vietnamese people to suffer brutal trampling. The "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" has become a butcher with hands stained with the blood of the South Vietnamese people.

With the help of the existence of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, the United States is intensifying its efforts to undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam. The United States not only directly participates in the "sweeps" to kill former resistance personnel, but also instructs the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to promulgate the so-called "Ordinance 10/59," a fascist decree, and establish "Special Military Courts" to widely persecute patriotic people in South Vietnam. Recently, the United States has not only illegally transported large quantities of military materials and personnel to strengthen South Vietnam's military expansion and war preparations, but has also openly formulated a Southeast Asia war plan that includes South Vietnam. U.S. Army Secretary Bruck said that the U.S. "Joint Chiefs of Staff have war plans to deal with situations that arise in fulfilling or supporting our obligations to members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization there," especially in Thailand and South Vietnam. It goes without saying that the U.S. conspiracy to expand the military advisory group in South Vietnam and legalize it serves its so-called war plan in Southeast Asia. If this conspiracy of U.S. imperialism succeeds, it will use the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" as a shield to unscrupulously tear up the Geneva Accords and step up its aggression in South Vietnam, and will transport U.S. troops into South Vietnam. As a result, South Vietnam will see a situation of U.S. armed occupation, turning South Vietnam into a second South Korea. And if U.S. troops openly enter South Vietnam, the peace and security of Indochina and Southeast Asia will inevitably be seriously threatened.

The demands of Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong and Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are undoubtedly very timely. As a close neighbor of Vietnam and a participant in the Geneva Conference, the Chinese people express their full support for this. We hope that the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference and the Chairman of the International Commission for Vietnam will, in the spirit of their unshirkable responsibility, take appropriate measures as soon as possible to stop the illegal interference of U.S. imperialism in Vietnamese affairs, dissolve the U.S. Military Advisory Group, so as to facilitate the realization of the cause of peaceful reunification of Vietnam and the peace and security of Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    必须制止美帝国主义在南越的新阴谋
    本报评论员
    越南民主共和国外交部长范文同，于4月16日打电报给1954年日内瓦会议两位主席（苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德）就美国同南越吴庭艳集团已经达成关于增加“美国军事援助顾问团”军事人员的协议，发出紧急呼吁。他要求两位主席指示越南国际委员会，拒绝吴庭艳集团关于增加“美国军事援助顾问团”军事人员的非法要求。越南人民军总司令武元甲大将也曾在4月15日打电报给越南国际委员会主席安萨里，要求国际委员会向南越当局建议：解散“美国军事援助顾问团”和它的组织机构，把它们撤出南越。范文同外长和武元甲总司令的两封电报，都强调指出美国和吴庭艳集团以代替法国在南越的军事教官为借口而扩大在南越的“美国军事援助顾问团”军事人员，是十分恶毒的阴谋，是明目张胆地破坏日内瓦协议的粗暴行为，是美国在印度支那所进行的非常露骨的挑衅行为。两封电报都明确指出，目前的情势是十分紧迫的。如果美帝国主义的这一阴谋不能及时地得到制止，其结果，日内瓦协议在越南的履行会遭到全面破坏，而越南和平的巩固和越南和平统一的实现将遭到严重的危机，印度支那和东南亚各国的和平和安全也将受到严重的威胁。
    “美国军事援助顾问团”在南越的存在，根本就是非法的。这一“顾问团”原是美帝国主义协助法国殖民主义者向印度支那各国进行侵略战争的工具。1954年签订的关于结束印度支那战争和恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议明文规定，法国“远征军”撤出越南，而且绝对不准许外国军队和军事人员进入越南。日内瓦协议第十六条规定，“禁止一切增援部队和新增的军事人员进入越南”。日内瓦协议最后宣言的第四段也规定：“禁止外国军队和军事人员以及各种武器和弹药进入越南”。既然日内瓦协议有此明确的规定，而且印度支那战争的主要发动者法国已按照日内瓦协议规定从越南撤出了它的侵略军队，那末曾经作为法国殖民主义者帮凶的战争机构“美国军事援助顾问团”，究竟还有什么理由赖在南越不走呢？显然，今天问题不在于是否允许美国军事顾问团人员的增减，而是在于绝对不容许它再赖在南越了。
    美帝国主义甘冒破坏日内瓦协议的大不韪，死不肯从南越撤走军事顾问团，是有它不可告人的目的的。当初美国设立这一军事顾问团协助法国殖民主义者进行侵略战争时，就打算加强对印度支那地区的干涉，逐步排挤法国的势力，取代法国的殖民地位，并且遏止和破坏越南、老挝、柬埔寨等国的民族独立解放运动。而在日内瓦协议签订和印度支那和平恢复后，美帝国主义则竭力利用这一机构，作为它破坏日内瓦协议和把南越变成它的殖民地与军事基地的重要工具。
    自从美国军事顾问团赖在南越以来，越南民主共和国人民以及亚洲和全世界的正义舆论，一再对美帝国主义的侵略行动提出抗议。直到最近，越南人民军总司令部联络代表，还给国际委员会写信，谴责美国利用美军顾问团这一机构，进行破坏日内瓦协议的罪恶活动。但是，美帝国主义一直置若罔闻，而且变本加厉，不断地扩大顾问团的规模。在1954年日内瓦协议签订时，“美国军事援助顾问团”不过二百人，其中高级军官二十名，今天却已增加为两千人，其中高级军官也增加到二百八十名。五年来，美国军事顾问团为非作歹，成了美国分割越南的得力工具和在南越发号施令的太上皇。它有着从训练军队、调动军队直到审查南越“国防”预算的巨大权力，牢牢地控制着吴庭艳集团的傀儡军队。从吴庭艳集团的“国防部”“总参谋部”、三军各兵种的“司令部”，以至各军区、各军、师、各个军事学校、各个战略建筑工程工地等军事部门，甚至一部分军事仓库，都有美国军事顾问团的人员在操纵着。最近这一顾问团又在一些重要市镇建立分团。尤其不能令人容忍的，是美国军事顾问团还参与策划、指挥，并直接参加了吴庭艳集团屠杀南越前抗战人员和广大爱国人民的“扫荡”。例如，美国威廉斯将军、钱伯斯中校参加了南部西面的“扫荡”；克莱上校、累斯特中校参加过南部东面的“扫荡”；巴特勒上校参加了吴庭艳集团在广治、承天、广南、广义各省的“扫荡”。美军在南越烧杀淫掳，使南越人民的生命安全遭受横暴的蹂躏。“美国军事援助顾问团”已经成了双手沾满南越人民鲜血的刽子手。
    借助于美国军事顾问团的存在，美国正变本加厉地破坏日内瓦协议在越南的履行。美国不仅直接参与残杀前抗战人员的“扫荡”，而且指使吴庭艳集团颁布所谓“59年第十号”法西斯法令，设立“特别军事法庭”广泛地迫害南越爱国人民。近来，美国不仅非法运进大批军事物资和人员来加强南越的扩军备战活动，而且公然拟订了包括南越在内的东南亚作战计划。美国陆军部长布鲁克说，美国“参谋长联席会议有着战争计划来应付在履行或者支持我们对那里的东南亚条约组织成员国所承担的义务这个方面所发生的情况”，特别是在泰国和南越。不待证明，美国阴谋扩大在南越的军事顾问团并使之合法化，是为它的东南亚的所谓作战计划服务的。如果美帝国主义的这一阴谋得逞，它将利用“美国军事援助顾问团”作盾牌，来肆无忌惮地撕毁日内瓦协议和加紧在南越的侵略活动，而且会把美国军队运进南越。其结果，南越将出现美国武装占领的局面，把南越变成第二个南朝鲜。而美国军队如果一旦明目张胆地进入南越，印度支那和东南亚的和平与安全，势必受到严重威胁。
    越南民主共和国范文同外长、武元甲总司令的要求，无疑是十分及时的。作为越南的近邻和日内瓦会议的参加国，中国人民对此表示完全支持。我们希望1954年日内瓦会议的两位主席和越南国际委员会主席本着不可推卸的责任，及早采取适当措施，制止美帝国主义对越南事务的非法干涉，解散美国军事顾问团，以利于越南和平统一事业的实现，以利于印度支那和东南亚的和平与安全。
