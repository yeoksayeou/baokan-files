Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 13th: Henan Province is broadly establishing technical schools to cultivate technical workers quickly, efficiently, and economically. Across the province, counties and communes are widely establishing technical schools and labor reserve schools (which are also of a technical school nature). By the end of February this year, there were already 164 technical schools with more than 46,800 students; people's communes have established 585 labor reserve schools with over 77,400 students. Currently, the tide of establishing technical schools by the whole people continues to move forward.

The rapid development of technical schools in Henan Province emerged during the upsurge of the continuous Great Leap Forward in socialist construction over the past two years. Before 1958, there were only nine technical schools in Henan Province with more than 5,000 students. In the two years of 1958 and 1959, 59 new schools were developed, adding 25,100 new students. Since the great historical tasks of widespread county and commune industries and agricultural technology transformation were proposed, the technical revolution and cultural revolution have been deepening, and all aspects urgently need a large number of technical workers. Since last winter, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, a province-wide upsurge of counties and communes broadly establishing technical schools and labor reserve schools quickly began.

Henan Province has earnestly adhered to the principles of diligence and frugality in running schools and self-reliance in the great development of technical schools. The funds and machinery and equipment required for new schools are mainly solved by relying on their own efforts. They put forward the slogan of "Building schools through labor, starting from scratch," building schools while teaching and producing, so that schools can be quickly established. Without funds, the schools vigorously carry out production and labor activities, organize students to contract work, develop sideline production, earn money to build houses, and purchase equipment. Without machines, teachers and students, under the guidance of veteran workers, broke down superstitions, dared to think and dare to act, manufactured their own equipment, using indigenous methods in place of foreign ones, combining indigenous and foreign methods. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient teachers, they cultivated their own teachers by running normal schools, short-term training classes, and master-apprentice methods; at the same time, they vigorously sought foreign aid, inviting technicians from factories to give lectures and retired veteran workers to provide technical guidance. Using these methods, more than 70% of the machinery and equipment and more than 44% of the teachers in the 59 new schools built in Henan Province in 1958 and 1959 were solved through self-reliance. In the past, it generally required an investment of two to three million yuan to open a school, but now the average investment for each of the 59 schools is less than 100,000 yuan. After the schools are built, they can generally achieve financial self-sufficiency in about a year, and some only take a few months. Henan Province's Seventh Technical School of the Labor Bureau has been established for more than a year, producing a large number of products to support the local industrial and agricultural Great Leap Forward, with a total output value of 1.2 million yuan, which is more than enough for self-sufficiency.

Closely relying on the leadership of the Party and vigorously carrying out mass movements are the basic experiences of Henan Province in broadly establishing technical schools. From top to bottom, Party committees at all levels in Henan attach great importance to technical schools. Many prefectural and county Party secretaries personally take charge and serve concurrently as principals of technical schools. In the process of running schools, they criticized the erroneous view held by a few people that technical schools could not be run without large factories, foreign machines, and tall buildings, as well as the lazy man's mentality of simply relying on higher-level allocations of funds and personnel and waiting for foreign aid. They resolutely let go of mobilizing the masses, vigorously carried out mass movements, and consistently adhered to the policy of relying on the masses to find their own ways, using simple and crude methods, starting with indigenous methods, and gradually improving from indigenous to foreign methods, so that the schools developed more, faster, better, and more economically.

Paying attention to combining education with productive labor from the very beginning of school construction is another important experience of Henan Province in broadly establishing technical schools. The benefit of doing this is not only that it produces products, supports the needs of industry and agriculture, and is warmly welcomed by the masses; but also that the schools quickly achieve financial self-sufficiency, laying the foundation for further development. At the same time, in productive labor, students receive good ideological training, love labor, study diligently, and improve quickly in cultural courses, operating skills, and technical and theoretical knowledge. The quality of teaching has improved significantly, and technical schools are praised as "three-satisfaction" schools that satisfy the Party committee, the masses, and the students.

In March of this year, the Ministry of Labor convened a national on-site meeting on technical worker training in Zhengzhou. The participants in this meeting unanimously believed that Henan's experience of broadly establishing technical schools and labor reserve schools in counties and communes is a successful school-running experience. It can train a large number of technical workers without the state spending much money, meeting the needs of high-speed industrial development and agricultural technology transformation, and can produce a large number of products to support national construction. The widespread and large-scale development of technical schools will continuously and systematically deliver labor to industrial enterprises.

### 满足工业遍地开花和农业技术改造的需要  河南县县社社大办技工学校

    满足工业遍地开花和农业技术改造的需要
    河南县县社社大办技工学校
    据新华社郑州13日电　河南省大办技工学校，多快好省地培养技术工人。全省县县社社大办技工学校和劳动后备学校（也是技工学校性质），到今年2月底止，技工学校已有一百六十四所，学生四万六千八百多人；人民公社举办的劳动后备学校五百八十五所，学生七万七千四百多人。现在全民办技工学校的浪潮还在继续向前发展。
    河南省技工学校的大发展是在过去两年社会主义建设连续大跃进的高潮中出现的。1958年以前，河南全省只有技工学校九所，学生五千多人，而在1958和1959年两年里，就发展新学校五十九所，新增学生二万五千一百人。自从县、社工业遍地开花，农业技术改造的伟大历史任务提出后，技术革命和文化革命日益深入地开展，各方面迫切需要大量的技术工人。去年冬季以来，在省委的领导下，全省很快掀起了一个县县社社大办技工学校和劳动后备学校的热潮。
    河南省在技工学校大发展中认真坚持了勤俭办学、自力更生的方针。新建学校所需的资金和机器设备主要都是依靠自己动手解决的。他们提出了“劳动建校，白手起家”的口号，边建校、边教学、边生产，使学校很快地建立起来。没有资金，学校就大搞生产劳动活动，组织学生包工揽活，发展副业生产，挣回钱来建筑房屋，购置设备。没有机器，教师学生们在老工人的指导下破除迷信，敢想敢干，自己制造，以土代洋，土洋结合。为了解决教师不足的困难，就用开办师范学校、短期训练班和师傅带徒弟等方式自己培养；同时大力争取外援，请工厂的技术员讲课，请退休老工人作技术指导。用以上这些办法，河南省在1958年和1959年新建的五十九所学校中，有70％以上的机器设备和44％以上的教师都是自力更生解决的。过去开办一所学校，一般要二、三百万元投资，现在五十九所学校平均每所不到十万元。学校建成后，一般一年左右有的只要几个月的时间就能实现经费自给。河南省劳动厅第七技工学校建立一年多，生产出大量的产品支援了地方工农业的大跃进，生产总值达一百二十万元，自给有余。
    紧紧依靠党的领导，大搞群众运动，这是河南省在大办技工学校中的基本经验。河南从上到下，各级党委都很重视技工学校，不少地委、县委书记亲自挂帅，兼任技工学校校长。在办学过程中，他们批判了少数人认为没有大厂房、洋机器、高楼大厦就不能办技工学校的错误观点，以及单纯依赖上级拨款调人、坐等外援等懒汉思想，坚决放手发动群众，大搞群众运动，自始至终坚持依靠群众自己想办法，因陋就简，土法上马，由土到洋，逐步提高的方针，因而使学校发展的又多又快又好又省。
    从建校工作一开始，就注意把教育与生产劳动结合起来，这是河南省在大办技工学校中的又一条重要经验。这样做的好处，不单是生产了产品，支援了工农业的需要，受到群众的热烈欢迎；而且学校很快实现了经费自给自足，为进一步的发展打下了基础。同时，在生产劳动中，学生在思想上受到了很好的锻炼，热爱劳动，刻苦学习，在文化课、操作技能和技术理论知识方面都提高的很快，教学质量有显著的提高，技工学校被人们誉为党委、群众和学生满意的“三满意”学校。
    劳动部于今年3月间在郑州召开了全国技工培养训练工作现场会议。参加这次会议的人员，一致认为河南县社大办技工学校和劳动后备学校是一个成功的办学经验，它既可以不要国家花多少钱培养训练大量的技术工人，满足工业高速度发展和农业技术改造的需要，又能生产大量产品，支援国家建设。技工学校的普遍大发展，将会源源不断地有计划地向工业企业输送劳动力。
