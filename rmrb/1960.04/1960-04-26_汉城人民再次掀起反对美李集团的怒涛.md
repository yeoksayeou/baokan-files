Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 25th: Seoul dispatch: The torrent of anger of the South Korean people against the US-Syngman Rhee clique's fascist rule continues to surge, impacting the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. Today, Seoul, Chuncheon, and other places again erupted in large-scale demonstrations involving tens of thousands of people.

The Seoul people's demonstration started at 6:00 PM, with student and citizen demonstration groups merging along the way amidst enthusiastic applause from citizens, forming a grand procession in the Jongno and the puppet National Assembly areas. The masses shouted slogans such as "Down with Syngman Rhee!" "The Syngman Rhee regime step down!" "Re-run the elections!" and so on.

The Syngman Rhee group hurriedly dispatched a large number of police and three tanks to suppress the demonstrators. The police fired tear gas at the masses. The demonstrating masses broke through the police encirclement and suppression, and climbed onto the tanks, shouting slogans from the tank tops.

At 9:00 PM, the demonstrating masses surrounded the residence of Lee Ki-poong, a confidant of Syngman Rhee who was elected "Vice President" in the recent fraudulent election, and angrily smashed the doors, windows, and furniture of his Western-style house with stones.

Demonstrators attempted to rush towards the US "Embassy" in South Korea. The Syngman Rhee troops opened fire to suppress them. The demonstrators shouted at the Syngman Rhee troops and police: "You are also Koreans, you also have a conscience, don't interfere with us!" "Let us go to the American Embassy to express our wishes!"

According to Tonghwa News Agency, at around 3:00 PM today, more than fifty Seoul university professors gathered in the Seoul University Professors' Hall. They passed sixteen proposals on the current situation, pointing out that the "great tragedy" of Syngman Rhee's massacre of the Seoul people on April 19th "was the result of Syngman Rhee's rule," and demanded that the Syngman Rhee "government" step down and that the puppet "National Assembly" members and the Syngman Rhee group's "Supreme Court" judges all resign. Then the professors took to the streets to demonstrate, and students and citizens joined their demonstration ranks, increasing the number of people. At the same time, student demonstration groups also poured in from all directions and merged together. According to South Korean News Agency reports, tens of thousands of citizens demonstrated on the streets and applauded and shouted slogans on both sides of the street.

In Chuncheon City, 130 kilometers northeast of Seoul and near the armistice line, students also held demonstrations for two consecutive days on the 24th and 25th to oppose the Syngman Rhee fascist rule. According to the Contract News Agency, more than 400 students from Chuncheon High School held a demonstration at 10:00 AM today. They shouted slogans condemning the Syngman Rhee group and fought with police who attempted to stop their demonstration. The students also wanted to rush into the office of the Syngman Rhee regime's South Gangwon Province government.

On the morning of the 24th, more than 500 male and female students in Chuncheon held a demonstration, shouting slogans such as "Severely punish the bad police" and "Immediately guarantee students' access to school," and marched through the streets of the city.

It is reported that in Incheon City, west of Seoul, more than 500 students held a demonstration again on the 24th.

Since the large-scale demonstration of more than 20,000 people in Masan on April 11th, the people of South Korea have held demonstrations against the fascist rule of the US-Syngman Rhee clique for half a month, and the demonstrations have spread to all eight provinces and each provincial capital in South Korea. Rising one after another and echoing each other, from Chuncheon near the armistice line in the north to Busan and Masan Port in the south, the people of more than 20 cities (almost all major cities) have roared in anger.

While continuing to carry out brutal suppression under the direction of the United States, the Syngman Rhee group has repeatedly resorted to deceptive tactics. In a statement issued on the 24th, Syngman Rhee hypocritically expressed "sympathy" to the relatives of the students killed by his military police. But his sinister face was also exposed in the same statement, as he threatened to "punish" the demonstrators.

On the same day, Lee Ki-poong announced that he had resigned from his positions as "Vice President-elect" and current "Speaker of the National Assembly." Prior to this, American news agencies had revealed that Syngman Rhee, under the direction of the United States, intended to use Lee Ki-poong as a scapegoat, forcing him to step down in order to ease the people's struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, 25th: Tokyo dispatch: More than 8,500 Korean residents in Japan held a meeting in Tokyo today, resolutely opposing the fascist dark rule of the Syngman Rhee group and supporting the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people.

The conference unanimously adopted a declaration. The declaration expressed support for the appeal to the South Korean people issued by the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party on the 21st, and demanded the immediate convening of a joint conference attended by representatives of political parties and social organizations from North and South Korea.

The declaration stated that Korean residents in Japan fully support the patriotic struggle of the South Korean people, resolutely demand the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, and fight to the end to overthrow Syngman Rhee and strive for the peaceful reunification of Korea. The conference declaration also demanded an immediate end to the so-called "talks" between Japan and the Syngman Rhee puppet government, which is despised by the Korean people.

Han De-su, Chairman of the General Federation of Korean Residents in Japan, spoke at the meeting. Han De-su strongly condemned the US imperialism for dragging South Korea into the current dark state. He pointed out that no matter how the US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee group play tricks, they cannot escape the serious responsibility they should bear.

Hakamada Satomi, a member of the Central Committee Cadre Council of the Japanese Communist Party, Hirano Yoshitaro, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, Kadoma Yoshinobu, Vice Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and Takatsu Masamichi, Vice Chairman of the Japan-Korea Association, were invited to attend the meeting. In their speeches at the conference, they all stated that the Japanese people will join hands with the Korean people to oppose the common enemy, US imperialism, and jointly fight to the end against the new Japan-US "Security Treaty" and for complete independence.

The conference dispatched 100 representatives to protest at the US Embassy in Japan and the Syngman Rhee group's "Representative Office" in Japan.

After the meeting, the participants held high the national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and many banners, and held a demonstration march on the streets.

On the 24th, about 2,500 Korean middle school students in Japan held a meeting in Tokyo, demanding that US troops withdraw from Korea. On the same day, more than 4,000 Korean students in Japan also held a demonstration march in Osaka, protesting against the Syngman Rhee group's killing of South Korean students and demanding that Syngman Rhee step down.

It is reported that on the 23rd, 150 Korean residents in Japan held a demonstration in front of the Syngman Rhee group's "Representative Office" in Tokyo, demanding that Syngman Rhee step down, release the arrested students, punish the murderers of the students, and also demanding that the Syngman Rhee group's "Ambassador" to Japan, Ryu Tae-ha, resign. The report said that this demonstration was initiated by the "Resident Group of Korean Residents in Japan," a Korean organization in Japan that has always supported Syngman Rhee.

    汉城人民再次掀起反对美李集团的怒涛
    示威者高呼“打倒李承晚”的口号　李伪军开枪阻止群众冲向美国大使馆
    旅日朝侨八千多人集会支持南朝鲜人民爱国正义斗争
    新华社平壤25日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜人民反对美李集团法西斯统治的怒涛继续汹涌澎湃地向李承晚傀儡政权进行冲击。今天汉城、春川等地又爆发了数万人的大示威。
    汉城人民的示威由下午六时开始，学生和市民的示威队伍在沿途市民的热烈的掌声中，浩浩荡荡地汇合在钟路和伪国会议事堂一带。群众高呼“打倒李承晚！”“李承晚政权滚下台来！”“重新进行选举！”等口号。
    李承晚集团慌忙派了大批的警察和三辆坦克前往镇压，警察向群众发射催泪弹。示威群众冲破警察的包围和镇压，并纷纷爬上坦克，在坦克顶上高呼口号。
    晚上九时，示威群众包围了李承晚的亲信、在最近伪选中当选“副总统”的李起鹏的住宅，愤怒地用石头捣毁了他的西式洋房的门窗和家具。
    示威者要冲向美国驻南朝鲜“大使馆”。李伪军开枪镇压。示威者向李伪军和警察喊道：“你们也是朝鲜人，你们也有良心，不要干涉我们！”“让我们到美国大使馆去表示我们的愿望！”
    据同和通讯社报道，今天下午三时许，先有五十多位汉城的大学教授在汉城大学教授会馆中集会，他们通过了十六项对时局的主张，指出4月19日李承晚屠杀汉城人民的“大惨剧是李承晚统治的后果”，并要求李承晚“政府”下台，要伪“国会”议员和李承晚集团的“最高法院”的法官都辞职。接着教授们上街举行示威，学生和市民纷纷参加他们的示威队伍，人数愈来愈多。同时，示威的学生队伍也从四面涌到，汇合在一起。据南朝鲜通讯社报道，在大街上示威和在大街两旁鼓掌呼口号的市民共有数万人。
    在汉城东北一百三十公里、靠近停战线的春川市，学生们在24日和25日连着两天也举行了示威，反对李承晚法西斯统治。据合同通讯社报道，今天上午十时，有春川高等学校学生四百多名举行示威。他们高呼着谴责李承晚集团的口号，并且同企图制止他们示威的警察进行搏斗。学生们还要冲进李伪政权南江原道政府的办公厅。
    24日早晨，春川的男女学生五百多名曾经举行示威，他们高呼“严惩恶劣的警察”、“立即保证学生们上学”等口号，走遍了市内各条街道。
    据报道，在汉城西面的仁川市，五百多名学生24日又举行了示威游行。
    自从4月11日马山爆发两万多人大示威以来，到今天，南朝鲜各地人民反对美李集团法西斯统治的示威已经连续举行了半个月，爆发示威的地区已经遍及南朝鲜所有的八个道和每个道的首府。此伏彼起，互相呼应，北起靠近停战线的春川，南至釜山和马山港，共有二十多个城市（几乎包括所有主要城市）的人民发出了怒吼。
    李承晚集团在美国指使下继续在进行残暴镇压的同时，一再耍弄欺骗手法。李承晚在24日发表的一项声明，猫哭老鼠地对被他的军警杀害的学生的亲属也表示“同情”。但是他的狰狞面目也就在同一篇声明中暴露了，他威胁说要“惩罚”示威者。
    同一天，李起鹏宣布，他已辞去“副总统当选人”和现任“国会议长”的职务。在这以前，美国通讯社曾透露，李承晚在美国指使下，打算以李起鹏为替罪羊，使他下台，以缓和人民的斗争。
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：旅日朝鲜侨民八千五百多人今天在东京举行大会，坚决反对李承晚集团的法西斯黑暗统治，支持南朝鲜人民爱国正义斗争。
    大会一致通过了一项宣言。宣言表示支持朝鲜劳动党中央委员会在21日发表的告南朝鲜人民书，要求立即召开南北朝鲜各政党和社会团体代表参加的联席会议。
    宣言表示，旅日朝侨全面支持南朝鲜人民的爱国斗争，坚决要求美军撤出南朝鲜，并且为打倒李承晚和争取和平统一朝鲜而斗争到底。大会宣言还要求立即停止日本同被朝鲜人民所唾弃的李承晚傀儡政府举行的所谓“会谈”。
    旅日朝鲜人总联合会议长韩德铢在大会上讲了话。韩德铢强烈指责把南朝鲜拖进目前黑暗状态中的美帝国主义。他指出，无论美帝国主义和李承晚集团怎样玩弄诡计，他们也逃不了他们应承担的重大责任。
    日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员袴田里见、日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎、日本工会总评议会副议长门间吉信和日朝协会副会长高津正道等人应邀出席了大会。他们在大会上致词一致表示，日本人民将同朝鲜人民携起手来反对共同敌人——美帝国主义，并且为反对新日美“安全条约”和争取完全独立而共同斗争到底。
    大会派遣一百名代表分别到美国驻日本大使馆和李承晚集团驻日本“代表部”进行了抗议。
    大会结束后，参加大会的人高举着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国旗和许多标语牌，到街上举行了示威游行。
    24日，大约二千五百名旅日朝鲜中学生在东京举行大会，要求美国军队撤出朝鲜，同一天，四千多名旅日朝鲜学生还在大阪举行示威游行，抗议李承晚集团杀害南朝鲜学生，并且要求李承晚下台。
    据报道，23日曾有一百五十名旅日朝侨在东京的李承晚集团驻日本“代表部”门前举行示威，要求李承晚下台，释放被捕的学生，惩办杀害学生的凶手，还要求李承晚集团驻日本的“大使”柳泰夏辞职。报道说，这次示威是过去一向支持李承晚的朝侨组织“在日朝侨居留民团”发起的。
