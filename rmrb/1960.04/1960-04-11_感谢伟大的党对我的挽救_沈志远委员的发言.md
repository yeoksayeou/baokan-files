I firmly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the agricultural development outline ahead of schedule.

	In the long process of remolding, I have only taken 
	the first step of the Long March, and I am still far 
	from the thorough ideological remolding
Over the past two years, in the face of the excellent domestic and international situation, under the continuous care, salvation, and education of the Party, and through continuous learning and social practice, my political orientation has undergone a basic shift, and my position has begun to change. Before the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China last year, the Party announced the removal of my rightist label, allowing me to gloriously return to the revolutionary ranks of the people. I first want to thank the great Party for saving me, and thank Chairman Mao's wise policy of curing the sickness to save the patient. I keep in mind at all times: Without the Party's salvation and Chairman Mao's wise policy, there would be no me today.

But in the long journey of remolding, I have only taken the first step of the Long March; future remolding will be even more difficult than the past. I am still far from a thorough remolding. Through more than two years of learning, labor, and work, although my direction has shifted somewhat, my understanding has improved, and I have begun to have some awareness of remolding, the serious problem is that I am still not enthusiastic enough and not energetic enough about the current vigorous and magnificent socialist construction movement; I am still unable to actively adapt to the long-term sustained tense life; I still have some fear of difficulties and lack of confidence in heavier tasks; I have not yet established the communist ambition to serve the people wholeheartedly; I often feel that the situation is developing too fast and I cannot keep up, so I have not yet completely overcome the middle-of-the-road thinking; although my theoretical understanding of many issues has gradually improved, I cannot implement them in action; subjectively, I always want to strive to be upstream and move forward quickly, but I am often dragged down by personal considerations and various old habits and old ideas. All these problems are ultimately due to the fact that the bourgeois position has not been fundamentally transformed, especially the deeply rooted bourgeois worldview still plays a dominant role in my spiritual world. This is the general outline of my current mental state.

Now, please allow me to report to the committee members some immature experiences I have gained in the past six months through learning and social practice regarding my worldview.

	During the democratic revolution, my feet 
	were firmly planted on the bourgeois position
Through the study of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, I initially examined my inner thoughts and attitudes towards some important political issues in these three stages, according to the spirit of the three general lines of the Party in three historical stages. I found that my bourgeois worldview is indeed systematic, complete, and consistent.

During the democratic revolution, although my body was in the revolutionary ranks, my feet were firmly planted on the bourgeois position, and my heart and all my cells were permeated with the decadent bourgeois democratic liberalism and individualistic worldview. Therefore, although I seemed to be following the Party on the surface at that time, I did not really accept the Party's democratic revolution program and the Party's general line of the democratic revolution. At that time, I supported the overthrow of the Kuomintang's fascist rule only because it directly threatened my personal freedom and right to life. I wanted to find a personal way out from the democratic revolution. Starting from such a position and motive, I conflicted with the most important principles of the Party's democratic revolution program and the general line of the democratic revolution, that is, I conflicted with the two fundamental principles of working-class leadership and the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation. At that time, my inner thoughts and emotions were actually afraid of the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and afraid of the real power of the workers and peasants, that is, I was unwilling to see the complete victory of the new democratic revolution. What I wholeheartedly pursued was the establishment of a democratic republic where all parties were free and equal and jointly in power. This is an unadulterated illusion of a bourgeois republic. This is one of the ideological roots of my gradual degeneration into a bourgeois rightist since 1956, which is the prominent manifestation of my bourgeois democratic worldview, which is antagonistic and irreconcilable with the working-class communist worldview.

	After the Party put forward the general line for the transition period, I
	was completely unprepared mentally, and I had resistance in my mind
From the national liberation to the proposal of the Party's general line for the transition period, I had always had the illusion that the new democratic order should be maintained for a considerable period of time and that capitalism would have a considerable period of development. I had always thought that there should be a historical stage of new democracy in which capitalism and socialism peacefully coexisted between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. Therefore, when the Party put forward the general line for the transition period in 1953 and announced that the establishment of the People's Republic of China marked the beginning of the socialist revolution, I was completely unprepared mentally, and I had resistance in my mind. Although the Party repeatedly called out loudly and constantly sounded the alarm, asking everyone to prepare to pass the socialist revolution test and work hard to transform themselves, I turned a deaf ear to it, thinking that I was already a "Marxist-Leninist" long ago, and I did not have any means of production in my hands, so passing the socialist revolution test was entirely a matter for the capitalists, and I could sit back and relax. In essence, I was fundamentally unwilling to accept socialist ideological remolding, fundamentally unwilling to pass the socialist revolution test, and always wanted to keep the capitalist politics, economy, and way of life for one more day. This shows that in the socialist revolution stage of the ownership of the means of production, my bourgeois worldview determined my basic requirements for the Party's general line for the transition period, especially for the basic program of the uninterrupted transition from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution, and I had great resistance.

After the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, that is, the socialist revolution on the economic front, achieved a basic victory in 1956, I thought that the socialist revolution had ended (because I had always thought that the socialist revolution was only changing the private ownership of the means of production into public ownership, and I never dreamed that there would be a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts), the class struggle had basically died out, and I thought that I had passed the socialist revolution test without any effort. Therefore, I felt relaxed and happy, and my tail was cocked high. At that time, I believed that since the class struggle had basically died out, the socialist revolution had basically ended, and the question of "who will win" between socialism and capitalism had been basically resolved, then the proletarian dictatorship could be used less or even shelved, and democracy and freedom (what I envisioned was of course bourgeois democracy and freedom) should be greatly expanded. Starting from the subjective wishes of a bourgeois democrat, I stubbornly regarded the Party's policy and guidelines of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools of thought contend" for further deepening the socialist revolution as a policy and guideline that was turning the clock back to the direction of bourgeois democratic politics. I distorted the correct handling of contradictions among the people and mobilizing all positive factors as "opening up" bourgeois democracy and freedom, mobilizing the "enthusiasm" of the bourgeoisie and its intellectuals, and thus regarded the Party's rectification as an opportunity to attack the Party. In short, it was the deeply rooted bourgeois democratic worldview that prompted me to fall into the quagmire of anti-Party and anti-socialism.

	The main essence of my worldview is the source of all evil,
	bourgeois individualism
But bourgeois democratic thought is not the main essence of my worldview. The main essence of my worldview, its core, is bourgeois individualism, the source of all evil; and its foundation is reactionary subjective idealism or egoism.

The proletarian worldview is a worldview of continuous revolution. From the first day of its birth, the proletarian party announced to the world that it would take the realization of communism as its revolutionary goal. In order to realize this great ideal, it will always adhere to carrying out the revolution to the end and always advocate continuous revolution. The proletarian worldview of continuous revolution is a scientific reflection of the objective laws of historical development, not the subjective creation of someone.

For decades, the bourgeois worldview with individualism as the core and subjective idealism as the foundation that I have adhered to cannot but be in a state of antagonism with the dialectical materialist continuous revolution theory. In the past half of my life, my mind has been ruled by a "supreme principle," that is, observing and treating everything starting from personal interests and personal preferences. This kind of individualistic thinking must inevitably form an indissoluble bond with subjective idealism, regarding subjective wishes as the "criterion" for observing and judging all objective things, and even using subjective wishes and subjective preferences to replace objective truth. Although I can recite the principles of the laws of social development, my thoughts and actions run counter to the specific and realistic objective laws.

Social development must inevitably go through constant changes and constant revolutions. This is an objective existence and an objective law. But individualism makes me blinded by profit, unwilling and afraid to face this objective fact. Since liberation, I have been holding the shameful and corrupt idea of: "The revolution has succeeded, now is the time to sit down and enjoy the fruits of the revolution." Therefore, at every stage of historical development, I always dream of maintaining the status quo and not moving forward. When the Chinese revolution has objectively entered the stage of socialist revolution, my subjective world still remains in the old stage of democracy, so I dream of "new democracy forever." When the socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory on the economic front, I hope that the revolution will stop here, and there is no need to carry out the class struggle of revolution in the future. However, these dreams were quickly shattered by the ruthless laws of historical development, and I reaped the evil consequences of my subjective idealism.

	I was completely unaware of the three magic weapons of the general line,
	the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune at first
Since the Party's general line for socialist construction was put forward, I have often struggled in the torrent of this great era, striving to be upstream and wanting to move forward quickly in the direction indicated by the Party, but I always feel that various old habits, old concepts, and old feelings are constantly coming out to obstruct, and repeated self-struggles are often carried out in the middle.

The direct and primitive reaction of thoughts and feelings to new things is the most accurate criterion for testing what class position a person is standing on and what class worldview he is holding. At first, I was completely unaware of the spiritual essence and great vitality of the greatest new things of the current era—the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune—the three magic weapons, and there were many absurd thoughts that became primitive reactions. Such as "more, faster, and better cannot save," "the general line is the product of the subjective wishes of a few people," "the People's Commune was established too early," "advanced rashly," and other right-leaning opportunist views, I had existed in the depths of my mind in the past. Summarizing those many absurd thoughts can be歸結attributed to two questions: (1) Do the three magic weapons meet the requirements of objective laws? (2) Do they embody the will and wishes of the broad masses of working people? The former is a question of objective possibility; the latter is a question of the subjective initiative of the people. After studying the relevant documents, although I began to negate my erroneous primitive thoughts, I had a little superficial theoretical understanding of these two questions, of the spiritual essence of the general line, and of the superiority of the People's Commune, but I was still very unclear in my mind about how to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical, how to achieve the development speed of the Great Leap Forward, and where the superiority of the People's Commune is specifically manifested. Regarding the People's Commune movement, when I heard about some shortcomings in the work of the commune before the rectification of the commune last spring, I thought that my original erroneous views of "established too early" and "advanced rashly" had probably been "confirmed." Last autumn, when I first read the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, I first noticed the adjustment of the targets, and my thoughts fluctuated a little about the reliability of the general line and the Great Leap Forward. After studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, participating in the anti-rightist and boosting-energy movement, and especially going deep into factories and rural areas for visits, I began to have a deeper understanding: I realized that the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are indeed magic weapons with immeasurable and great vitality for China's socialist construction and preparation for the transition to communism, and are brilliant examples of the great Mao Zedong Thought that creatively developed Marxism-Leninism by combining the specific practice of China's revolution and construction. At the same time, I also realized that the fundamental key to the two major problems mentioned above lies in the estimation of the revolutionary will, revolutionary perseverance, and revolutionary creative spirit of hundreds of millions of people, and in the view and attitude towards carrying out mass movements in construction. And the estimation of the revolutionary creative role of the people and the attitude towards mass movements are important criteria for testing what class position a person is standing on and what class worldview he is holding.
	I recently visited and inspected several factories and received
	an unusually vivid general line education
Recently, I participated in several visits and inspections, which gave me an unusually profound and unusually vivid and touching general line education. From just a few factories and People's Communes, I have already personally seen the countless production miracles created by the workers and peasants, and the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do is generally promoted. For the sake of the Party's cause and to strive for continuous leaps forward, they broke superstitions, emancipated their minds, broke through conventions and overcame all difficulties, worked tirelessly, day and night, and carried out creative selfless labor. For example, the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, last year, under the conditions of insufficient equipment and heavy difficulties, had to manufacture a giant 30,000-kilowatt transformer within a limited time of only three months. Because the Party leadership of the factory closely relied on the masses and boldly mobilized the masses, the workers all used their brains, exerted their soaring energy, and made great efforts in technical innovation, adopting the method of designing, producing, and appraising at the same time. As a result, a giant transformer weighing 120 tons was manufactured in only 59 days; the second was reduced to 47 days; the third was even less, only 38 days. However, what if such a large and bulky thing cannot be transported out? The factory leaders, according to the proposal of the masses, mobilized 700 workers to build a railway branch line within a few days, connecting the Xinzhuang Station, and transported it to Wangting on schedule before the National Day and installed it. Another example is the Shanghai Watch Factory, which was established only three years ago, and its output jumped from 2,000 in 1957 to 74,000 in 1959; this year's planned target is 400,000. In order to realize the call of "exceeding one year in one quarter and adding seven times in one year," the workers made great efforts in technical innovation, and in more than 80 days this year, they realized 433 technical innovation projects. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the entire factory has increased from 72.4% at the beginning of the year to 98.5% recently. Another example is the Shanghai State Cotton No. 2 Factory. The original machinery and equipment could only spin coarse yarn, and most of it had reached the age of scrapping. In the past, it only produced "four gentlemen" black cloth. Last year, in order to meet the growing needs of the people's lives, it was required to increase the variety of colors and produce high-grade poplin. If we follow the "conventional" method, we can only eliminate the old machines and replace them with new equipment, which will take at least three years and cost millions of dollars. However, under the leadership of the Party, the workers put forward the slogan of "self-reliance" and "arming themselves," reformed the old machines, and made their own combing machines. As a result, a large number of high-grade poplin were produced within a year, the new varieties reached 147 kinds, and a large amount of funds were saved.

These vivid and touching examples completely solved the two basic problems that were not clear enough in my mind in the past: Does the general line conform to objective laws? Does it embody the will and wishes of the broad masses? The answer can only be 100% affirmative. The above examples are more convincing than one hundred or one thousand articles, making people firmly believe that more, faster, better, and more economical are not only possible, but also inevitable; the high-speed development of continuous leaps forward is not only possible, but also inevitable. Similar situations not only occur in the above three factories, but are common in all factories in Shanghai and China; not only occurred in 1958 and 1959, but also occurred in 1960, and will continue to occur in future years. Then, what else is this if it is not a reflection of objective laws? However, this objective law is not embodied in the old traditional "conventions," but breaks through conventions, implements politics in command, boldly mobilizes the masses, fully mobilizes the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and relies on the power of the masses to solve problems. This objective law is the law of high-speed development reflected in the general line of socialist construction. It is combined with the firm will and urgent desire of the masses to accelerate the transformation of China's backwardness and move towards communism, and it is combined with the revolutionary perseverance and revolutionary pioneering spirit generated by this will and desire.
	After inspecting the countryside, it greatly helped me to clarify
	the great superiority of the People's Commune
Recently, I went to Songjiang and Jinshan to inspect several People's Communes, which also greatly helped me to clarify my understanding of the great superiority of the People's Commune. Whether an organization and system is superior mainly depends on whether it promotes the development of productive forces and how much it promotes it. Taking Jinshan County as an example: In the eight years before the commune, the county's grain yield per mu increased by an average of 6.9% per year, while in the two years of 1958 and 1959, it increased by an average of 22% per year. The Red Flag Team of the Fengtuan People's Commune in Songjiang used to have an average annual growth rate of generally a few percent, while in 1958 and 1959, it increased by 30% and 80% respectively; the Xinwu People's Commune also jumped by 30% and 18% respectively in these two years. It is particularly worth noting that most of these areas are low-lying areas, which have suffered from floods for years and often had no harvest. Like the Xinwu Commune, as long as it rained for half a month in the past, 95% of the cultivated land would be flooded and become a vast ocean. The Party Committee of the Commune, based on the requirements and suggestions of the broad masses of commune members, actively mobilized the masses to carry out water conservancy construction, and successively opened up the "Send Disaster River," "Construction River," and Xilingtang. As a result, the disaster area became a blessed area, and the poor countryside became a rich countryside. There is no difference between high and low land, and it has been fertile for years. In the past, it was ripe once every three years, but now it has become ripe three times a year. What a remarkable change this is!

Inspecting these People's Communes made me have a deeper understanding of the superiority of the commune, especially two points that are more prominent: (1) The Great Leap Forward in agricultural production occurred in poor communes with weak foundations, poor conditions, and many disasters, (2) The Great Leap Forward was achieved under the condition that there was basically no mechanization. The original foundation of these communes, their natural conditions and economic and technical conditions, were far worse than those of some communes in the suburbs of Shanghai. But not only did they achieve leap-forward production increases like the rich communes with strong foundations and good conditions, but they also leaped forward more and better in some aspects. Secondly, if it is said that some communes in the suburbs of Shanghai have already begun to have a certain degree of development of mechanization, then most of the communes in Songjiang and Jinshan counties, except for mechanical and electrical irrigation, generally have not yet been mechanized, but they can also achieve the Great Leap Forward. Their battle target this year is to achieve "three harvests a year, each harvest exceeding 1,000 catties." I realized that the decisive reason here is still the great vitality of the general line, the combination of the Party's correct leadership and the vigorous development of mass movements, and the invincible material strength exerted by the Party's general line and Mao Zedong Thought being grasped by the broad masses. In turn, examining my past erroneous views and doubts about the People's Commune, in essence, is not a problem of understanding, but a problem of position and class prejudice, and ultimately it is still a problem of worldview.

In the past, I lacked understanding of this main essence of the general line, and I was somewhat skeptical or even resistant to the vigorous development of mass movements. The reason is that I lacked trust in the wisdom and ability of the working masses, and the root causes of not trusting the wisdom and ability of the masses are two: (1) The class root cause is the long-term standing on the opposite position to the working people, holding class prejudices that despise and despise the working people; (2) The cognitive root cause is the idealist thought that history is created by a few outstanding people, or a few educated and talented people (this is the self-superstition and megalomania of bourgeois intellectuals), and denies that history is first of all the history of producers of material wealth and the bourgeois prejudice of "seeing things but not people."

	Determined to continue to work hard to thoroughly destroy the bourgeois
	position and worldview
Currently, every corner of our great motherland is launching a new and epoch-making great revolution, that is, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement sweeping every factory, every enterprise, and every People's Commune. In this great revolution, the working masses are creating unimaginable miracles every minute and every second. For a person engaged in theoretical research, there are inexhaustible, inexhaustible, incomparably vivid, and infinitely rich scientific "mines" for us to excavate, collect, and refine. Therefore, I feel that theoretical research today will become a meaningless thing, and even a waste, if it is divorced from the practice of this great revolution that declares war on the earth. This helps me to further reverse the long-standing serious deviation from reality, deviation from the masses, and the bourgeois research direction that is accustomed to theory for the sake of theory. Through learning and the observation and practice of social life for more than two years, although this direction has begun to change somewhat, and I have begun to realize the importance of going deep into reality, participating in actual struggles, and integrating with the workers and peasants, the implementation has been very insufficient in action, and the old habits are still stubbornly influencing my thinking. In the personal plan I made last winter, I had concretized the systematic study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought mainly as reading and writing, and often instinctively opposed studying Chairman Mao's works with participating in social activities in my mind, thus producing the distress of "taking care of one thing and losing another." After the help of the leaders of my unit and seeing with my own eyes the revolutionary movement of the workers and peasants in making a large number of inventions and creations, I realized how deep-rooted my bourgeois bad habits of closed-door research were, so that I felt keenly that it would be very dangerous if I did not immediately and completely break with this bad habit and the entire bourgeois worldview; if I did not clarify the direction of theoretical research, make it absolutely obey the current actual struggle led by the Party, obey the current political tasks, serve the revolutionary movement of great socialist construction, and devote myself to this hot revolutionary movement, I would be far behind by the current constantly leaping forward situation.

Committee members, although I have been fortunate enough to return to the socialist train in the past year under the continuous salvation and education of the Party, I have progressed very slowly on the road of remolding due to my insufficient subjective efforts. The fundamental reason is that I lack the spirit of continuous revolution, that I have not taken the Party's general line for socialist construction as the criterion for my thoughts and actions, and that I have not been able to correctly establish the communist ambition; in a word, it is because I have not been able to thoroughly destroy the bourgeois position and worldview and establish the proletarian position and worldview. Accepting the painful lessons of the past and grasping the key to the current problems, with the correct direction and path of the Party's remolding of intellectuals, I dare to guarantee to the Party and to the comrades: I will always closely rely on the Party, unconditionally listen to the Party's words, and under the supervision and help of the masses, actively devote myself to the current revolutionary struggle of socialist construction, especially to devote myself to the practice of productive labor, go deep into the working masses to receive training and education, and at the same time concentrate my energy on systematically and deeply studying Mao Zedong Thought, the creative Marxism-Leninism of this new historical stage, to arm my mind, resolutely carry out a thorough break with the reactionary bourgeois worldview, and transform myself into a true working-class intellectual, and dedicate everything I have to the infinitely beautiful socialism and communism.

My speech may have many errors. Please criticize and correct me.

专栏：

    感谢伟大的党对我的挽救
    沈志远委员的发言
    我坚决拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告、陈叔通副主席的政协全国委员会常委会的工作报告，及谭震林副总理为提前实现农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告。
    在漫长的改造过程中，我只迈进了
    万里长征的第一步，距离脱胎换
      骨的思想改造还遥远得很
    过去两年多来，在国内外大好形势面前，我个人在党的不断关怀、挽救和教育下，经过了不断的学习和社会实践，我的政治方向有了基本的转变，立场也开始有所变化。在去年建国十周年前夕，党宣布摘去我的右派帽子，使我光荣地回到了人民的革命行列。我首先要感谢伟大的党对我的挽救，感谢毛主席的治病救人的英明方针。我时时刻刻铭记在心头：没有党的挽救，没有毛主席的英明方针，就不会有今天的我。
    但在漫长的改造途程中，我仅只迈进了万里长征的第一步；今后的改造比过去一段路程会更加艰巨。现在我距离脱胎换骨的改造还遥远得很。经过过去两年多的学习、劳动和工作，虽然方向有所转变，认识有些提高，对改造也开始有了一点自觉性，但严重的问题在于：对当前轰轰烈烈、雄伟壮阔的社会主义建设运动，还是热情不够高、干劲不够大；对长期持续的紧张生活还不能主动地适应；对繁重一点的任务有时还有畏难情绪和信心不足；对于为人民服务还没有树立起共产主义的雄心大志；时常感到形势发展太快，自己跟不上去，因而至今未能完全克服中游思想；对于许多问题，理论认识虽然逐步有所提高，行动上却不能照着去贯彻；主观上也总想力争上游、快步前进，却又时常被个人考虑和各种旧习惯、旧想法拖住后腿。所有这一切毛病，归根结底还是由于资产阶级立场没有得到根本的改造，特别是根深蒂固的资产阶级世界观还在自己的精神世界里起着优势作用。这是我目前的精神状态的总轮廓。
    现在请允许我就自己的世界观问题，向委员们汇报一下最近半年来我通过学习和社会实践所得到的一些不成熟的体会。
      在民主革命时期，我的脚跟牢
      固地站在资产阶级的立场上
    通过党的八届八中全会文件的学习，我根据党在三个历史阶段的三条总路线的精神实质，初步检查了自己在这三个阶段中对于一些重要政治问题的当时的内心思想活动和所持态度。我发觉自己的资产阶级世界观确实是系统完整、长期一贯的。
    在民主革命时期，我身虽处在革命的行列中，我的脚跟却牢固地站在资产阶级的立场上，我的心和全身细胞则渗透着腐朽的资产阶级民主自由主义和个人主义的世界观。因此，当时我表面上虽像是在跟着党走，实际上却并没有真正接受党的民主革命纲领、党的民主革命的总路线。我当时对于推翻国民党的法西斯统治是拥护的，只是因为它直接威胁着我个人的自
  由和生活权利。我是想从民主革命中寻找个人的出路。从这样的立场和动机出发，我对党的民主革命纲领、民主革命总路线的最重要的原则发生抵触，即对工人阶级领导、工农联盟为基础这两条根本原则有抵触。当时我内心的思
  想情感实际上是害怕共产党的绝对领导，害怕
  工农群众的真正当家作主，也就是不愿意新民
  主主义革命的彻底胜利。我所一心追求的是建
  立一个各党派自由平等的联合执政的民主共和国。这是不折不扣的资产阶级共和国的幻想。这就是1956年以来我逐步蜕化为资产阶级右派的思想认识根源之一，也就是我的资产阶级民主主义世界观的突出表现，它同工人阶级共产主义世界观是对抗的，水火不相容的。
    党提出过渡时期的总路线后，我
  完全没有精神准备，思想上有过抵触
    从全国解放到党的过渡时期总路线的提出这一时期，我思想上一直存在着新民主主义秩序应保持一个相当长的时期、资本主义还会有一个相当长的发展时期的幻想。我一直以为在民主革命和社会主义革命之间应当隔着一个资本主义与社会主义和平共存的新民主主义历史阶段。因此，当1953年党提出过渡时期总路线，并宣布中华人民共和国的成立标志着社会主义革命的开始时，我是完全没有精神准备的，而且思想上是有过抵触的。党虽一再大声疾呼，不断敲起警钟，要大家做好过社会主义革命关的准备，努力改造自己，我却充耳不闻，自以为老早就是“马列主义者”，手上又没有生产资料，过社会主义革命关完全是资本家们的事，我可以高枕无忧。实质上是根本不愿接受社会主义的思想改造，根本不愿过社会主义革命的关，总想让资本主义的政治经济、生活方式多保留一天好一天。这说明在生产资料所有制的社会主义革命阶段中，我的资产阶级世界观决定了我对党在过渡时期的总路线的基本要求、特别是对由民主革命不停顿地转入社会主义革命这一基本纲领，发生了很大的抵触。
    在1956年对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造、即经济战线上的社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，我以为社会主义革命已经结束（因为我一向以为社会主义革命只是变革生产资料私有制为公有制，从来也没有梦想到还有什么政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命），阶级斗争已经基本熄灭，自以为已经不费吹灰之力地挨过了社会主义革命这一关了。因而心里轻松愉快，尾巴翘得老老高。我当时认为阶级斗争既已基本熄灭，社会主义革命既已基本结束，社会主义和资本主义两条道路“谁战胜谁”的问题已经基本解决了，那末无产阶级专政就可以少用、甚至可以搁起了，而民主自由（我所设想的当然是资产阶级民主自由）应该大大加以扩大才好。我从资产阶级民主主义者的主观愿望出发，把党的“长期共存、互相监督”、“百花齐放、百家争鸣”为了进一步深入开展社会主义革命的政策方针，硬看成向资产阶级民主政治的方向开倒车的政策方针了。我把正确处理人民内部矛盾、调动一切积极因素，歪曲为“开放”资产阶级民主自由、调动资产阶级及其知识分子的“积极性”、从而把党的整风看成向党进攻的机会了。总而言之，是根深蒂固的资产阶级民主主义世界观促使我堕入反党反社会主义的泥坑里去。
      我的世界观主要实质，是万恶
        之源的资产阶级个人主义
    但是资产阶级民主主义思想还不是我的世界观的主要实质，我的世界观的主要实质、它的核心，是万恶之源的资产阶级个人主义；而它的基础则是反动的主观唯心主义或唯我主义。
    无产阶级的世界观是不断革命的世界观。无产阶级的党从它诞生的头一天起就向全世界宣布以实现共产主义作为它革命的奋斗目标。为了实现这一伟大理想，它永远坚持把革命进行到底，永远主张不停顿地进行革命。无产阶级的这种不断革命的世界观是历史发展的客观规律的科学反映，而不是某一个人主观臆造出来的。
    几十年来我所坚持的以个人主义为核心、主观唯心主义为基础的资产阶级世界观却不能不与辩证唯物主义的不断革命论处于对抗状态。我在过去大半辈子中头脑是一直被一条“最高原则”统治着，那就是观察和对待一切事物都首先从个人利益、个人好恶出发。这种个人主义思想必然与主观唯心主义结下不解之缘，把主观愿望当作观察和判断一切客观事物的“准则”，甚至用主观愿望、主观好恶去代替客观真理，口头上虽能背诵关于社会发展规律的原理，而思想和行动上却与具体现实的客观规律背道而驰。
    社会发展必然要经过不断的变革、不断的革命，这是客观存在，也是客观规律。但个人主义使我利令智昏，不愿也不敢正视这种客观事实，解放以来我一直抱着：“革命已经成功，现在是坐下来享受革命果实的时候了”的可耻的腐朽思想，因而在历史发展的每一阶段上总梦想保持现状，不再前进。当中国革命客观上已经进入到社会主义的革命阶段时，我的主观世界却依然停留在民主主义的老阶段上，因而梦想“新民主主义万岁”。当社会主义革命已经在经济战线上取得了决定性胜利时，我又希望革命到此为止，今后无需乎再进行革命的阶级斗争了。然而这些梦想都很快地为无情的历史发展规律所粉碎，自食其主观唯心主义的恶果。
    对总路线、大跃进和人民公社这三
  个法宝，最初我也是完全茫然的
    从党的社会主义建设总路线提出以来，我经常在这大时代的激流中挣扎着力争上游、想向党所指示的方向快步前进，可是又时刻感到各种的旧习惯、旧观念、旧感情不断地出来阻挠，这中间经常进行着反复的自我斗争。
    对于新生事物的思想感情上的直接的原始反应，是检验一个人站在什么阶级立场、抱着什么阶级的世界观的最准确的标准。我对于当前最伟大的新生事物——总路线、大跃进和人民公社等三大法宝的精神实质及其伟大生命力，最初是完全茫然的，成为原始反应的荒谬思想是很多的。诸如“多快不能好省”、“总路线是少数人主观愿望的产物”、“人民公社办早了”、“冒进了”等等的右倾机会主义观点，我过去思想深处都存在过。把那许多荒谬思想概括起来可以归结到两个问题：（一）三大法宝究竟是否符合客观规律的要求？（二）它们究竟是否体现广大劳动群众的意志和愿望？前者是客观可能性的问题；后者是人民群众的主观能动性的问题。经过有关文件的学习，虽然开始否定了自己错误的原始思想，对于这两个问题，对于总路线的精神实质和人民公社的优越性有了一点浮面的理论认识，可是对于究竟怎样实现既多快又好省，怎样实现大跃进的发展速度，人民公社的优越性究竟具体地表现在哪里等等问题，思想上还是很不明确的。对于人民公社化运动，在去年春整社前听到公社工作中发生了一些缺点时，心里就以为自己原来怀疑“办早了”、“冒进了”之类的错误看法大概是得到“证实”了。去年秋，刚读到八届八中全会公报时，我首先就注意到调整指标，思想上对于总路线和大跃进的可靠性又起过一点波动。经过八届八中全会文件的学习，参加反右倾、鼓干劲运动的启发教育，以及特别是深入工厂和农村进行参观访问，才开始有了比较深切的体会：体会到总路线、大跃进和人民公社确确实实是对于我国社会主义建设及准备向共产主义过渡具有无可估量的巨大生命力的法宝，是结合中国革命和建设的具体实践而创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的伟大毛泽东思想的光辉典范。同时也体会到产生上述两大问题的根本关键在于对亿万人民群众的革命意志、革命毅力和革命创造精神的估计，在于对建设中大搞群众运动的看法和态度。而对人民群众的革命创造作用的估计和对群众运动的态度，又是检验一个人站在什么阶级立场、抱着什么阶级的世界观的重要准则。
  最近参观和视察了几个工厂，受到
    了一次异常生动的总路线教育
    最近参加了几次参观和视察，使我受到了异常深刻、异常生动感人的总路线教育。我仅仅从几个工厂和人民公社中已经亲眼看到了工农群众创造的说不尽、道不完的生产奇迹，普遍地高扬着敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。为了党的事业、为了争取持续不断的跃进，他们破除迷信、解放思想、突破常规排除万难，废寝忘食、夜以继日地进行着创造性的忘我劳动。例如上海电机厂，去年在设备不足、困难重重的条件下，要在短短三个月限期内制造出三万瓩的巨型变压器。由于工厂党领导紧密地依靠群众，放手发动群众，工人们个个开动脑筋，发挥冲天干劲，大闹技术革新，采取边设计、边生产、边鉴定的办法，结果一具一百二十吨重的巨型变压器只花了五十九天就制成了；第二个减少到四十七天；第三个更少，只用了三十八天。但是，这样一件又大又笨重的东西运不出去怎么办？厂领导依照群众的倡议，动员了七百个工人几天内修筑了一条铁路支线，接通莘庄车站，国庆节前如期运到目的地望亭，并且把它安装好。又如上海手表厂建立了才不过三年，产量由1957年的二千只跳到1959年的七万四千只；今年的计划指标是四十万只。工人群众为了实现
  “一季超一年、一年加七倍”的号召，大闹技术革新，今年八十多天内实现了技术革新项目四百三十三个，全厂机械化、半机械化程度由年初的72.4％最近提高到了98.5％。再如上海国棉二厂。原有机器设备只能纺粗纱，且大部分已达到报废年龄。过去一向只生产“四君子”黑布一种。去年为了满足人民生活日益增长的需要，要求增加花色品种，生产高级府绸。如果按照“常规”办事，只有淘汰老机器、更换新设备，至少需时三年，投资千百万。但工人群众在党的领导下，提出了“自力更生”、“自己武装自己”的口号，改革了老机器、自制了精梳机，结果一年内就生产了大批高级府绸，新品种达到了一百四十七种，而且大大地节约了资金。
    这些生动感人的事例，完全解决了过去我思想上不够明确的那两个基本问题：总路线是否符合客观规律？是否体现广大群众的意志和愿望？答复只能是百分之百肯定的。上述的例子比一百、一千篇文章还更有说服力，令人斩钉截铁地深信多快而又好省，不仅是可能、而且是必然的；不断跃进的高速度发展，不仅是可能、而且是必然的。类似的情况不只发生在上述三个工厂，而是普遍存在于全上海、全中国所有的工厂；不只发生在1958年、1959年，而且也发生在1960年，并将继续不断地发生在今后的年代。那末，这不是客观规律的反映又是什么呢？不过这种客观规律并不是体现在老一套传统的“常规”上，而是突破常规，实行政治挂帅，放手发动群众，把群众的积极性、创造性充分调动起来，依靠群众的力量解决问题。这种客观规律就是反映在社会主义建设总路线上的高速度发展的规律。它是同群众要求加速改变我国落后面貌、走向共产主义的坚决意志和迫切愿望结合在一起的，是同由于这种意志和愿望而产生的革命毅力、革命首创精神结合在一起的。
    到农村视察后，大大帮助我明
      确了人民公社的巨大优越性
    最近到松江、金山去视察了几个人民公社，也大大地帮助我明确了对人民公社的巨大优越性的认识。一种组织和制度的是否优越，主要就要看它是否促进生产力的发展和促进得多少。以金山县为例：该县粮食亩产量在公社化以前的八年中，每年平均增长6.9％，而1958年和1959年两年则平均每年增长22％。松江枫团人民公社的红旗队过去每年平均增长率一般都是百分之几，而1958和1959两年则分别增长30％和80％；新五人民公社这两年也分别飞跃增长了30％和18％。这里特别值得注意的是这些地区大部分是低洼地区，过去连年发生涝灾，经常颗粒无收。像新五公社过去只要有半个月下雨，95％的耕地就被水淹没，变成一片汪洋。社党委根据广大社员的要求和建议积极发动群众大搞水利建设，先后开辟了“送灾河”，
  “建设河”，及西岭塘，结果使灾区变成福区，穷乡变成富乡，地无高低之分，连年丰产，过去是三年一熟，现在变成一年三熟。这是何等了不起的变化！
    视察这几个人民公社，使我对于公社的优越性有了比较深切的体会，特别有两点比较突出的，那就是：（一）农业生产的大跃进发生在底子薄、条件差、灾害多的穷社，（二）在基本上没有机械化的条件下实现了大跃进。这几个公社原来的基础，它们的自然条件和经济技术条件，都比上海近郊的一些公社差得远。可是它们不但也像底子厚、条件好的富社那样实现了跃进式的增产，而且某些方面还跃进得更多更好。其次，如果说上海近郊的一些公社，机械化已经开始有了一定程度的发展，那末松江、金山两县的大部分公社除了机电灌溉外，一般都还没有机械化，而他们同样能够实现大跃进，他们今年的战斗指标是要达到“一年三熟，熟熟超千斤”。我体会到这里的决定性原因仍然在于总路线的巨大生命力，在于党的正确领导和大搞群众运动相结合，在于因党的总路线和毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握而发挥出来的所向无敌的物质力量。反过来检查自己过去对人民公社的错误看法和怀疑态度，实质上并不是认识问题，而是立场和阶级偏见的问题，归根结蒂仍然是世界观的问题。
    我过去对于总路线的这一主要本质缺乏认识，对大搞群众运动有所怀疑甚至抵触，原因在于对劳动群众的智慧和能力缺乏信任，而所以不信任群众的智慧和能力，根源有二：（一）阶级根源是长期以来站在与劳动人民对立的立场，抱着轻视和鄙视劳动人民的阶级偏见；（二）认识根源是以为历史是少数杰出人物、或少数有学问、有才能的人所创造（这是资产阶级知识分子的自我迷信和自大狂），而否定历史首先是物质财富生产者的历史的唯心主义思想和“见物不见人”的资产阶级偏见。
      决心继续努力，大破资产阶级
            的立场和世界观
    目前我们伟大祖国的每一个角落正在展开一次新的、划时代的大革命，那就是席卷每一工厂、每一企业、每一人民公社的技术革新和技术革命运动。在这场大革命中，劳动群众每分每秒钟都在创造着令人难以想像的奇迹。对于一个从事理论研究工作的人，这里有着取之不竭、用之不尽、无比生动、无限丰富的科学“矿藏”，待我们去采掘、收集和提炼，因而感到今天从事理论研究如果脱离了这场向地球宣战的大革命的实践，就会变成毫无意义的事情，甚至变成一种浪费。这就帮助我进一步扭转长期以来严重地脱离实际、脱离群众、习惯于为理论而理论的资产阶级研究方向。两年多来经过学习和社会生活的观察和实践，虽然这个方向开始有些转变，开始认识到深入实际、参加实际斗争、与工农群众打成一片的重要性，但是行动上却贯彻得很不够，旧习惯势力仍然顽固地影响着我的思想。在去冬所订的个人规划里，我曾把系统地学习马列主义、毛泽东思想具体化为主要是读书和写作，而且在思想上时常本能地把钻研毛主席著作同参加社会活动对立起来，从而产生“顾此失彼”的苦恼。经过本单位领导的帮助和亲眼看到了工农群众轰轰烈烈的大量发明创造的革命运动，才发现自己的关门研究的资产阶级恶习是如此深固，以至痛切感到若不立即与这种恶习和整个资产阶级世界观彻底决裂，那是十分危险的；若不明确理论研究工作的方向，使它绝对服从当前党所领导的实际斗争，服从当前的政治任务，为伟大的社会主义建设的革命运动服务，并且投身到这一火热的革命运动中去，就会被当前不断跃进的形势远远抛到后面去。
    各位委员，在最近的一年内我虽然在党的不断挽救和教育下幸运地回到了社会主义的列车上来，但由于自己主观努力很不够，我在改造的道路上进展得很迟缓。根本原因还在于缺乏不断革命的精神，在于没有把党的社会主义建设总路线作为自己思想和行动的准则，没有能正确地树立起共产主义的雄心大志；一句话，是由于我还没有能大破资产阶级的立场和世界观，大立无产阶级的立场和世界观。接受过去的惨痛教训，抓住当前存在的问题的关键所在。有着党的改造知识分子的正确方向和途径，我敢向党、向同志们提出保证：我要永远紧紧地靠拢党、无条件地听党的话，在群众的监督和帮助下，积极投身到当前热火朝天的社会主义建设的革命斗争中去，特别要投身到生产劳动实践中去，深入到劳动群众中去接受锻炼教育，同时要集中精力系统深入地学习毛泽东思想这一历史新阶段的创造性的马克思列宁主义，来武装自己的头脑，坚决同反动的资产阶级世界观实行彻底的决裂，把自己改造成为一个真正的工人阶级知识分子，为无限美好的社会主义、共产主义献出我的一切。
    我的发言，错误可能很多，请各位委员批评指正。
