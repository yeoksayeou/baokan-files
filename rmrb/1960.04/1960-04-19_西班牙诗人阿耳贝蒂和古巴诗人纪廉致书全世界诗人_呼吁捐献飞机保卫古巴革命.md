Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 18th: Spanish poet Rafael Alberti and renowned Cuban poet Guillén recently jointly published a call, urging poets around the world to hold poetry festivals in order to raise funds to purchase "Poetry Aircraft" to defend the Cuban Revolution.
    The aforementioned call was made at a poetry recital they co-hosted. The audience attending the poetry recital, held at the Cuban Workers' Confederation's theater, purchased tickets voluntarily. All proceeds will go towards the fund for purchasing the "Poetry Aircraft".
    Spanish poet Alberti recited three poems dedicated to the Cuban patriot Pablo de la Torriente, who sacrificed himself in the Spanish War of 1937, including "International Brigade" and "Defend Madrid". Cuban poet Guillén then recited the poems dedicated to the Cuban land reform, "Land of Mountains and Plains" and "Elegy for Jesús Menéndez."
    Cuban Minister of Education Arte spoke at the recital, saying that this poetry recital linked the Cuban and Spanish people, who have had a common destiny in history. The people of the two countries are united in the voices of the two poets and in their ideals and goals.
    Alberti pointed out in his speech at the recital that Cuban poet Guillén had helped the Spanish people fighting for justice with his poems in the past. He said, "Cuba is a spring leaf in the sea of hope for the people of Latin America."
    Spanish poet Alberti and his wife, Teresa León, arrived in Cuba three weeks ago for a visit. Cuban President Dorticos received them.
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 18th: Spanish outstanding poet Rafael Alberti and Cuban famous poet Guillén jointly signed and published an appeal to poets all over the world on the 11th. The appeal said that through this letter sent from Havana today (April 11, 1960), we call on poets all over the world to donate money to buy "Poetry Aircraft" to defend the Cuban revolution.
    The two poets said in their appeal that we ask poets who believe in the unity of the people to hold meetings in every country and every city of your country, and to hold poetry meetings like the ones we have just held, so as to raise donations among all the people to buy an airplane to guard the coast of the heroic island nation of Cuba.
    The appeal pointed out that when the people of a country choose a system of national freedom with their blood, and combine the will of the majority with their historical destiny, poets should support this free decision.
    The appeal said that if this free decision is misunderstood, attacked by privileged forces, threatened by privileged forces who often burn crops regardless of all rights, and maliciously attacked by certain international enemies who confuse public opinion, then it is just for poets to donate money to defend it, because poetry has always been the noblest cause supporting the destiny of all peoples since ancient times.
    The appeal said that we call on all poets to join the Cuban poets in defending this right, because we believe that the liberation enthusiasm displayed by the Cuban people cannot be restricted or suffocated. The appeal concluded by saying that we also hope that this "Poetry Aircraft", which we have already seen in our imagination with a star of unity painted on its wings, will serve the cause of peace and land reform, and the happy days of the Cuban people in the future.

    西班牙诗人阿耳贝蒂和古巴诗人纪廉致书全世界诗人
    呼吁捐献飞机保卫古巴革命
    新华社18日讯　哈瓦那消息：西班牙杰出诗人拉斐尔·阿耳贝蒂和古巴著名诗人纪廉最近联合发表号召书，呼吁全世界诗人举行诗歌联欢会，以便捐款购买“诗歌号飞机”用来保卫古巴革命。
    上述号召书是在他们共同举办的诗歌朗诵会上发表的。参加这次在古巴工人联合会的剧院举行的诗歌朗诵会的听众以自愿付款的方式购买入场券。所有的收入作为购买
  “诗歌号飞机”的基金。
    西班牙诗人阿耳贝蒂朗诵了献给在1937年西班牙战争中牺牲的古巴爱国者帕夫洛·德拉托里恩特的“国际纵队”和“保卫马德里”等三首诗。古巴诗人纪廉接着朗诵了献给古巴土地改革的诗篇“山脉和平原的土地”和“赫苏斯·梅嫩德斯挽歌”。
    古巴教育部长阿特在朗诵会上发言说，这次诗歌朗诵会把在历史上有过共同命运的古巴和西班牙人民联结在一起。两国人民在两位诗人的声音中以及在他们的理想和目标上面团结了起来。
    阿耳贝蒂在朗诵会上发言时指出：古巴诗人纪廉过去以诗篇帮助了为正义而战的西班牙人民。他说，“古巴是拉丁美洲人民希望的大海中的一片春叶”。
    西班牙诗人阿耳贝蒂和他的夫人特雷萨·莱昂是三个星期以前到古巴访问的，古巴总统多尔蒂科斯曾经接见了他们。
    新华社18日讯　哈瓦那消息：西班牙杰出的诗人拉斐尔·阿耳贝蒂和古巴著名诗人纪廉11日联合署名发表致全世界诗人的呼吁书。呼吁书说，通过今天（1960年4月11日）从哈瓦那发出的这封信，我们号召全世界诗人捐款购买“诗歌号飞机”来保卫古巴革命。
    这两位诗人在他们的呼吁书中说，我们要求相信人民团结的诗人们在每个国家和你们国家的每个城市中举行会议，并举办像我们刚刚举行那样的诗歌会，以便在所有的人中募捐购买一架守卫英雄的古巴岛国海岸的飞机。
    呼吁书指出，当一个国家的人民以他们的鲜血选择了一个民族自由的制度，使大多数人的意志和他们的历史命运结合在一起的时候，诗人应当支持这个自由的决定。
    呼吁书说，假如这个自由决定受到误解，受到特权势力的攻击，受到特权势力不顾一切权利经常以纵火焚烧庄稼相威胁，受到某些国际敌人迷惑舆论的恶意攻击，那么，诗人捐款保卫它是正义的，因为诗歌自古以来从来就是支持各国人民命运的最崇高事业的。
    呼吁书说，我们号召所有的诗人同古巴诗人一起参加保卫这一权利，因为我们认为，古巴人民焕发的解放热情是限制不了，窒息不了的。呼吁书最后说，我们也希望，我们想像中已经看到的机翼上画着一颗团结星的这架“诗歌号飞机”将为和平和进行土地改革的任务，为古巴人未来的幸福日子服务。
