Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Guangdong Province, which traditionally enters the busy season of rice transplanting around "Qingming," basically completed early rice planting before this year's "Qingming" Festival. As of April 5th, the province had already transplanted more early rice than the total area of early rice planted last year, exceeding it by more than 7%, accounting for 86% of this year's planned planting area. Except for fields where winter crops had not yet been harvested, all blank fields had been transplanted. Currently, some regions with later seasons are continuing to complete the final stages of transplanting, while most regions have shifted to field management. Early rice production in Guangdong has historically been unstable, with the saying "early four, late six" being common. To break this pattern, based on the experiences of the two Great Leap Forward years, early sowing and early transplanting to extend the vegetative growth period of early rice and avoid the wind and rain during the maturity period is a crucial measure. To achieve earliness, farmers across the province launched a massive farmland capital construction campaign immediately after the autumn harvest last year. Whether it was water conservancy construction, deep plowing and soil improvement, or fertilizer accumulation, the original plans were overfulfilled one to two months ahead of last year. Therefore, this year, whether it was sowing, fertilizer delivery, field preparation, or transplanting, everything was done more than half a month earlier than last year.

A mass high-yield movement to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture at a higher standard, transforming low-yield fields into high-yield fields and making high-yield fields even higher-yielding, is unprecedented in scale. The slogan of "thousands of catties" remains the general slogan for this year. More than 99,000 high-yield plots, each with an area of 50 mu or more, have been identified across the province. These high-yield plots account for 32% of the total early rice area.

Due to the practices of the past two years, advanced cultivation techniques centered on rational close planting have been mastered by the majority of farmers and have entered a new stage of popularization throughout the province. Therefore, the quality of transplanting this year is particularly good, with rational close planting being universally achieved, with approximately 200,000 seedlings per mu.

Currently, all parts of the province have moved non-stop to early rice field management. In order to seize a high yield of early rice, all localities are implementing the principle of "earliness as the key link and fertilizer as the commander," implementing measures such as rational fertilization, scientific irrigation and drainage, pest control, and prevention of lodging according to higher standards, and diligently managing high-yield plots. A mass movement to strive for increased production and higher yields, with early rice surpassing late rice, is vigorously unfolding.

### 广东提前在“清明”前基本插完早稻

    广东提前在“清明”前基本插完早稻
    据新华社讯　历来在“清明”前后才进入插秧大忙的广东省，今年“清明”前就基本上插完了早稻。到4月5日止，全省已经栽插的早稻，比去年全部早稻面积还多7％以上，占今年计划种植面积86％。除去冬种上越冬作物尚未收获的田没有插秧以外，空白田已经全部插了秧。现在，季节较迟的部分地区正在继续完成插秧扫尾工作，大部分地区已经转上田间管理。广东早稻生产向来不够稳定，有“早四晚六”的常规。要打破这一常规，根据两年大跃进的经验，早播早插，延长早稻营养生长期和避过成熟期的风雨，是一项带关键性的措施。为了早，全省农民在去年秋收一结束，便开展规模浩大的农田基本建设运动，不论是水利建设、深耕改土或积肥，都比去年提前一两个月超额完成了原定计划。因此，今年无论播种、送肥、办田、插秧，都比去年提早半个月以上。
    以更高的标准贯彻农业“八字宪法”，要低产田变高产、高产田更高产的群众性高产运动，规模之大，前所未有。千斤运动仍然是今年的总口号。全省各地确定经营五十亩以上的高产片有九万九千多片，这些高产片的面积占早稻总面积32％。
    由于过去两年的实践，以合理密植为中心的先进栽培技术已为广大农民所掌握，在全省范围进入了普及的新阶段，因此今年插秧质量特别好，普遍做到合理密植，每亩苗数在二十万株左右。
    现在，全省各地已经马不停蹄地转上早稻田间管理工作。为了夺取早稻高产，各地实行以早为纲，以肥为帅，按照更高的标准来贯彻合理施肥、科学排灌、防治虫害、防止倒伏等措施，认真经营高产片。一个争取超产多收、早稻超晚稻的群众运动正在蓬勃地开展起来。
