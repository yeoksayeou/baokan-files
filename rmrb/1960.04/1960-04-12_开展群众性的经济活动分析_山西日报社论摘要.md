Analysis of Conducting Mass Economic Activities
--Excerpts from a Shanxi Daily Editorial

The Sunji People's Commune in Wanrong County is engaging in mass economic activity analysis, which is a good way to combine diligence and thrift in running the commune with democratic management, and to combine the development of mass movements with strengthening management. What is economic activity analysis? Broadly speaking, the continuous development process from supply to production, to distribution, to sales is the process of economic activity. In the process of economic activity, a planned, purposeful, systematic, comprehensive, periodic, and non-periodic analysis and research is conducted on the utilization of land, labor, means of production, and production funds, as well as the implementation of production plans. The aim is to discover problems, summarize experiences, and solve and promote them in a timely manner, in order to promote the continuous leap forward of production and achieve maximum results with minimum expenditure. This method is called economic activity analysis.

How to carry out mass economic activity analysis?

The experience of Sunji Commune points out that in order to make economic activity analysis play a greater role, it is necessary to adopt a method that combines leading cadres, professional personnel, and mass movements. Without the active participation of leading cadres, it will become unorganized; without the participation of professional personnel, it will not be possible to obtain comprehensive and accurate information, and their advisory role will be lost; without mass movements, it will not be possible to better mobilize the production enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members.

Our people's communes are large collectives of thousands of people, and production work is a mass movement. Under the specific conditions of such a large collective and large-scale production, it is definitely not possible to do a good job if the masses are not mobilized to jointly manage the commune's economic work and conduct economic activity analysis with the masses, but only a few people are responsible for it. It is also impossible to do a good job of economic activity analysis without a comprehensive understanding of the situation and accurate numerical basis. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of statistical personnel, financial personnel, and business personnel, and to give full play to their subjective initiative, and to effectively play the role of staff. The figures they master should not only be comprehensive, but also timely and accurate, and the statistical personnel, financial personnel, and business personnel of the specialized departments should first make a preliminary analysis of their own materials, and then provide them to the leaders and the masses for analysis and research.

In order to give full play to the role of economic activity analysis, it is necessary to implement it throughout the year and adhere to it to the end. We suggest that all commune party committees, in addition to conducting regular economic activity analysis, should conduct at least three to four large-scale mass economic activity analyses within a year. Roughly: the first should be conducted before the start of the busy season, and the main content is to mobilize the vast number of commune members to use analytical research methods to conduct a large-scale inspection of the preparation work for spring plowing and production, such as whether the land has been cultivated well, whether seeds and fertilizers are sufficient, whether the arrangement of labor and animal power is appropriate, and whether there are any problems with the lives of the commune members. The second should be placed before the summer harvest, and the main content is to analyze and study the preparation work for the summer harvest and the pre-distribution work for the summer harvest. The third should be conducted before the autumn harvest, and the main content is to check the preparation work for the autumn harvest and autumn planting and the formulation of the annual distribution plan. The fourth should be at the end of the year, and the main content is the distribution final account, the annual summary, and the formulation of various plans for the next year.

The experience of Sunji Commune also proves that whether the commune's economic work can be done more and more meticulously and better and better depends on the leadership, first of all on the leadership of the commune party committee. The commune's economic work is the main body and core of all work in the commune. Therefore, it is impossible to lead the commune's large-scale production well, and it is impossible to become a good commune cadre without understanding economic work, without conducting economic activity analysis, and without understanding the economic accounting system. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly called on us: "Study some political economy," which is the reason. Facts have proved that engaging in economic activity analysis is not only a magic weapon for promoting the great leap forward in production, but also a good school for training cadres, improving management level, educating the masses, and stimulating the masses to participate in management consciously.

    开展群众性的经济活动分析
    ——山西日报社论摘要
    万荣县孙吉人民公社大搞群众性的经济活动分析，是把勤俭办社和民主办社结合起来，把开展群众运动和加强管理工作结合起来的一种好形式，是实行经济核算的一种好形式。什么是经济活动分析呢？概括地讲，从供应到生产、到分配到销售这个连续不断的发展过程，就是经济活动的过程；在经济活动过程中，通过对土地、劳力、生产资料、生产资金等的利用情况和生产计划的执行情况，进行有计划地有目的地和系统地、全面地、定期与不定期地分析研究，从中发现问题，总结经验，及时加以解决和推广，以促进生产的不断跃进，达到以最小限度的支出，换得最大限度的成果。这种方法，就叫做经济活动分析。
    如何开展群众性的经济活动分析呢？
    孙吉公社的经验指明，要想使经济活动分析发挥更大作用，必须采用领导干部、专业人员、群众运动三结合的方法。没有领导干部的积极参加，就会形成自流；没有专业人员的参加，就不能取得全面的、精确的资料，就会失去他们的参谋作用；没有群众运动，就不能更好的调动广大社员群众的生产积极性。
    我们的人民公社是成千上万人的大集体，生产工作就是群众运动。在这样一个大集体大生产的特定条件下，不发动群众来共同管理公社经济工作，不同群众一道进行经济活动分析，只是由少数人去包揽，肯定是搞不好的。没有全面情况的掌握，没有精确数字的依据，要想把经济活动分析做好，也是不可能的。因此，必须加强对统计人员、财务人员、业务人员的领导，要充分发挥他们的主观能动性，切实起到参谋人员的作用。要求他们掌握的数字不仅要全面，而且要及时和准确，并且应该由统计人员、财务人员和专管部门的业务人员，首先对自己的材料作出初步分析，然后提供领导和群众分析研究。
    为了能够充分发挥经济活动分析的作用，必须作到贯彻全年、坚持到底。我们建议，所有公社党委，除了进行经常的经济活动分析外，一年之内至少要进行三到四次大规模的群众性的经济活动分析。大体上是：大忙开始以前进行第一次，主要内容是发动广大社员群众，运用分析研究的方法，对春耕生产准备工作进行一次大规模的检查，如地是否耕好，种籽、肥料是否备足，劳力、畜力安排是否恰当，社员生活有无问题等。第二次应放在夏收以前进行，主要内容是分析研究夏收准备工作与夏收预分工作。秋收前进行第三次，主要内容是检查秋收、秋种的准备工作与全年分配方案的制定。年终为第四次，主要内容是分配决算，全年总结，制定下一年度的各种计划。
    孙吉公社的经验又证明，公社经济工作能否越作越细，越作越好，关键在于领导，首先是公社党委的领导。公社经济工作是公社一切工作的主体和核心。因此，不懂经济工作，不会进行经济活动分析，不懂经济核算制，就无法领导好公社大生产，就不会成为一个公社好干部。党中央和毛主席曾一再号召我们：“要学点政治经济学”，就是这个道理。事实证明，大搞经济活动分析，不仅是促进生产大跃进的法宝，而且是培养干部、提高经营管理水平，教育群众，激发群众参加管理自觉性的一所好学校。
