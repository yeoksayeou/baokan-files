      A Red Flag
    A red flag is planted across the country, heroes are determined to surpass England.
    A red flag is planted throughout the station, everyone strives to be a pioneer.
    A red flag is planted across the yard, everyone acts like a hero.
    A red flag is redder and redder, the East wind will always prevail over the West wind.

      Belt Conveyor
    Belt conveyor, operates like a machine,
    Goods are placed on it, automatically taken to the train,
    No more shoulder pads or cushioning, no more thick skin on shoulders,
    Feel light and happy, loading and unloading effortlessly. (Attached picture)
    Scraper conveyor, loads cars as fast as flying.
    Combined Bulk Loader
    Electric Shovel Unloading Coal
    Small Crane is Truly Clever

    天津站西货场装卸用机器	赵静东速写　天津站西货场工人诗
      一杆红旗
    一杆红旗插全国，英雄立志超英国。
    一杆红旗插全站，人人当好先行官。
    一杆红旗插全场，人人都把好汉当。
    一杆红旗红又红，东风永远压西风。
      皮带输送机
    皮带输送机，开动像机器，
    货物往上放，自动上车去，
    垫肩压箱底，肩头除厚皮，
    身轻心头乐，装卸不费力。（附图片）
    括板转送机，装车快如飞
    联合散装机
    电铲卸煤
    小型吊车真灵巧
