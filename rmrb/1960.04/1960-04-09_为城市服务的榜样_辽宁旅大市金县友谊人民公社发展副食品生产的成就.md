    Great Development of Vegetables, Fruits, Livestock and Poultry
    Since its establishment, the Friendship People's Commune in Jin County, Lushun-Dalian City, Liaoning Province, has made brilliant achievements in developing non-staple food production and supporting urban construction.

    The Friendship People's Commune is located in the suburbs of Jinzhou, sixty li from Lushun-Dalian City. It is surrounded by mountains and the sea, with plains in the middle. The climate is mild and rainfall is abundant, suitable for the development of horticultural crops and diversified operations. This commune was officially established in September 1958 from six advanced cooperatives. The entire commune has 4,160 households with a population of 22,825, with a cultivated area of 34,502 mu and 175,000 fruit trees.

    After the establishment of the commune, in order to adapt to the needs of industrial production development, increased urban population, and the ever-increasing consumption levels, it conscientiously implemented the policy of suburban production serving the city, changing the past emphasis on grain production to an emphasis on developing non-staple food production. After more than a year, it has fully utilized the superior conditions of the people's commune and local natural resources to build a strong non-staple food production base, becoming a bright red flag serving the city.

    Due to the development of non-staple food production, the commodity volume of non-staple foods has increased significantly, causing profound changes in production and sales. Taking Jinzhou Town as an example, this town has a population of only 65,000. Before communization, the locally produced vegetables could not meet the needs of the entire town, and 500 to 600 tons of vegetables had to be imported from other places every year. After communization, the locally produced vegetables not only met the needs of the entire town, but also supplied 12,800 tons to Lushun-Dalian City throughout the year. In this area, the average vegetable consumption per person in 1955 was 118 jin, which increased to 180 jin in 1957 and 330 jin in 1959.

    The development of non-staple food production has further met the growing needs of urban people's lives, strengthened the relationship between urban and rural areas, and also increased the income of the commune and its members. For example, in 1958, the total income of the commune was 3,853,000 yuan. After deducting all expenses, the portion distributed to commune members was 1,603,000 yuan, an average of 73.2 yuan per person. In 1959, due to the expansion of vegetable, livestock, fishery, and fruit production, the total income increased to 33,464,647 yuan, and public accumulation reached 1,005,016 yuan, an increase of 38.1% over the previous year. After deducting all expenses, the portion distributed to commune members was 2,374,211 yuan, an average of 101 yuan per person, an increase of 38% over 1958, thus creating conditions for implementing a monthly wage payment system based on income growth. According to statistics as of September 1959, the total amount of wages paid to commune members had reached 763,000 yuan, and the lives of commune members had greatly improved.

    These irrefutable facts prove that the people's commune, a brand-new form of social organization, can better implement the policy of suburban production serving the city, while also increasing the income of commune members and raising their living standards more quickly.
    Putting Politics in Command, Ideology First
    The commune's implementation of the policy of suburban production serving the city was not entirely smooth. When formulating the production plan in the spring of 1959, a few wealthy middle peasants put forward the argument of "planting less, higher prices, and selling for more money." Some said: "The city has to eat vegetables anyway, plant a little less, sell at a higher price, and isn't it the same to earn more?" Others said: "If production is high, the price is low, it may not necessarily mean more income." Individual poor and lower-middle peasants emphasized growing more grain, saying: "The grain supplied by the state is never as convenient as what we produce ourselves, so let's plant less vegetables." These two arguments were fundamentally different. The former was a capitalist management ideology, and the latter belonged to the self-sufficiency viewpoint of a small-scale economy. In response to these arguments, the commune Party committee promptly led the farmers in a major debate. The vast number of farmers used a large number of facts to criticize the capitalist management ideology and the self-sufficiency viewpoint of a small-scale economy. At the same time, the Party committee guided the farmers to calculate two accounts: the first was a political account, calculating the great victories achieved by the peasants under the leadership of the working class through a series of struggles, and emphasizing the important political significance of further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance in the new situation of socialist construction; the second was an economic account, calculating the income from developing non-staple food production, further illustrating that implementing the policy of suburban areas serving the city was beneficial to both workers and peasants. At the same time, in order to more effectively educate the farmers, they were also organized to visit the commune's horticulture management area to see the various supports in technology and equipment from industry to agriculture. This visit gave the farmers the most vivid lesson in worker-peasant alliance education. Commune members reflected that: "The farm tools and machines we use, which one isn't made by workers? Without the support of the workers, agricultural production cannot be done well, we must produce more non-staple foods to supply the city and support industrial production." Through a series of activities such as major debates, accounting, and visits, the farmers' awareness was universally raised, laying the ideological foundation for the development of non-staple food production.

    The most prominent difficulty encountered by the Friendship Commune in developing non-staple food production was the shortage of labor. The great leap forward in industrial production required the suburbs to constantly supplement new labor, and the commune supported industrial construction with more than 360 young and middle-aged laborers in that year alone. Due to the expansion of vegetable acreage, the labor input per mu of vegetable field was about 110, which is equivalent to ten times that of a large field, and the labor shortage was even more acute. In order to solve this problem, the commune vigorously developed collective welfare undertakings, establishing a total of 35 canteens, 56 nurseries, 23 kindergartens, and 17 sewing departments, liberating 862 female laborers to participate in production, which not only solved the problem of labor shortage, but also changed the economic and political status of women. The second is to adopt short-term blitz and mutual cooperation methods. For example, when the Eight Mile Management Area was in the season of picking apples, the weather forecast predicted a typhoon, and the horticulture management area transferred a large number of laborers to support them, reducing losses. By improving labor organization and promoting short-term contracting and distribution according to labor, the enthusiasm of commune members was also stimulated, and labor efficiency was increased by 50%. In addition, tool reform was also carried out. Irrigation of gardens and fields basically eliminated the use of manpower for watering, most of which used animal power to draw water, and there were 55 electric wells, each electric well equivalent to the irrigation efficiency of ten animal-powered wells, greatly improving labor productivity.

    Agricultural-Commercial Cooperation, Production and Sales Combined
    Strengthening agricultural-commercial cooperation and combining production and sales is one of the fundamental changes on the non-staple food production front after communization. Since the establishment of the commune, the implementation of the five-in-one of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military has solved the various contradictions of decentralized operation of small cooperatives, implemented unified leadership, and comprehensively arranged, further improving the quality of service for the needs of urban people. The commercial sector has thoroughly changed the past practice of only being responsible for sales, not for production, and sitting and waiting for goods to be sold, strengthened the production viewpoint and the mass viewpoint, and conscientiously implemented the policy of starting from production, participating in production, and supporting production. The commercial sector conducted in-depth investigations and studies on the consumption level of urban people, solicited opinions on the quantity and variety of non-staple foods, and then helped the commune formulate production and sales plans based on the national plan, and signed production and sales contracts with the commune, with all products contracted by the commercial sector at fair and reasonable prices. This encouraged the production enthusiasm of farmers and solved the commercial sector's fear of not being able to sell and accumulating losses and the farmers' fear of overproduction causing rotten vegetables, eliminating "double fear". At the same time, the commercial sector also sent purchasers to be stationed in the commune and key management areas for a long time, going deep into the production process, participating in production, and supporting production. For example, in the summer of 1959, vegetables suffered from pests. At that time, due to insufficient pesticides, the commercial sector took the initiative to trial-produce nine kinds of local pesticides, among which the "5169" pesticide was very effective and played a great role in eliminating pests. In order to support livestock production, the commercial sector established breeding farms to help the commune cultivate breeding pigs. During the period of swine fever prevention, they also organized forces to help inject vaccines, promoting the development of the commune's pig farming production.

    In the vegetable purchase work, the commercial sector took many measures that were both beneficial to producers and consumers, implementing "on-site purchase, on-site weighing, on-site packaging, on-site shipment" and "direct flow linkage" methods, using stores to package areas and outlets to package teams (that is, vegetable stores package management areas and retail outlets package production teams), and the production units directly send vegetables to retail units. On the one hand, this reduces the circulation links of vegetables, ensures the freshness and quality of vegetables on the market, and on the other hand, it can achieve market launch according to plan, so that vegetables in the peak season are not pressed or rotten, ensuring the stability of vegetable prices, and increasing a large amount of income for the commune. In the autumn of 1958, the commune increased its income by five to six thousand yuan from replacing the commercial sector in vegetable packaging alone. Now, commune members no longer have to worry about the losses caused by the concentrated market launch of vegetables in the peak season.

    In order to help the commune develop non-staple food production, the commercial sector also helped the commune raise funds, build water conservancy projects, purchase and transport production materials, and help solve problems such as the source of seeds, feed, and epidemic prevention for the development of livestock and poultry. For example, after the spring vegetable fields of the commune were expanded, the originally prepared frame materials were far from meeting the needs, and the commercial sector helped them purchase 600,000 bundles of frame materials from other places, solving the urgent need. During the peak season of vegetable market launch, the vegetable company not only lent its own tarpaulins to the commune, but also personally sent people to the fields to help build sheds and pack vegetables. When the commune lacked wood for building greenhouses, the vegetable company took out some of the wood used for building cellars and padding stacks for its own use and supplied it to the commune at a low price, actively helping the commune expand the production of winter vegetables.

    Due to the implementation of agricultural-commercial cooperation and the combination of production and sales, in 1959, the vegetables supplied by the Friendship Commune to the city not only increased significantly in quantity compared with previous years, but also initially reversed the situation of insufficient supply in the off-season and surplus in the peak season in the vegetable market over the years.
    Urban-Rural Relations are Closer
    People's communization and the Great Leap Forward have made the economic and political ties between the working class and the working farmers closer, and the mutual support and friendly exchanges between workers and peasants have become more intimate. The new type of socialist urban-rural relationship has entered a new stage.

    With the gradual expansion of the degree of collectivization, the state's assistance to suburban production in terms of the supply of production materials and technological transformation has also become greater and greater. For example, in the early stage of the primary cooperative in 1955, the total output value of the main production materials supplied by the state industry was 166,700 yuan, which reached 219,550 yuan in the advanced cooperative stage in 1957, and increased to 317,930 yuan after communization in 1959.

    In the short year since the establishment of the commune, the agricultural machinery supplied by urban industry to the commune, including power and drainage and irrigation machinery alone, included 55 electric motors, 5 diesel engines, and 30 electric water pumps, as well as a large amount of cheap electricity, making the newly installed electric wells in the commune more than the total installed in the primary cooperative and advanced cooperative years combined, and newly increased 282 horsepower of pumping capacity, achieving basic water conservancy for vegetable fields and basically realizing irrigation electrification in professional vegetable management areas at one stroke. In the spring of 1959, during the key season for spring vegetable sowing, emergence, and fruit tree flowering, a major drought occurred that had not been seen for decades, which seriously threatened the harvest of spring vegetables, fruits, and grains. At this time, factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, troops, schools, and street residents in Dalian and Jinzhou Town organized a total of 156,000 person-times to go to the countryside to participate in the fight against drought, helping to overcome the drought and protect the harvest. In daily life, the friendly exchanges and mutual support between neighboring factories, mines, and enterprises and the commune are even too numerous to mention. Jinzhou Heavy Machinery Factory and Yangjia Management Area have formed a close friendship in the Great Leap Forward. When Yangjia Management Area encountered difficulties due to insufficient equipment for drilling electric wells, the Heavy Machinery Factory took out ten utility poles and one thousand meters of electric wire to support them. Due to the shortage of fertilizer after the vegetable fields were expanded, the manure and furnace ash from the factory were all supplied to them, equivalent to establishing a fertilizer depot for them in the factory. In 1959, as many as 500,000 to 600,000 jin of manure and furnace ash were pulled back from the factory. In late June, more than 300 mu of wheat fields in the entire area were already golden and ripe, waiting to be harvested. The weather suddenly changed, and it looked like the harvest of wheat was about to suffer serious losses. It was beyond the ability of the management area alone. In the crisis, they went to the Heavy Machinery Factory for help. The Heavy Machinery Factory immediately dispatched 400 workers to help rush to harvest for two days, and all the more than 300 mu of wheat were seized before the rain. The commune members gratefully said from the bottom of their hearts: "If it weren't for the help of the worker elder brothers, our 50,000 jin of wheat would have been completely ruined!"

    After communization, the socialist consciousness of suburban farmers has been further improved. They regard increasing non-staple food production to serve the city as their glorious duty, and have shown great enthusiasm in ensuring urban supply and meeting the non-staple food needs of the worker elder brothers. When there were few vegetables in the city in early spring, the farmers gave priority to supplying cucumbers and tomatoes to the city, preferring to eat less or not at all themselves. In the minds of the farmers, the relationship between workers and peasants is now just like what Xiao Mingli, a member of the Sanli Management Area, said: "We and the urban workers are like relatives. Is it better to bring something good or something bad when visiting relatives? Of course, it's better to bring something good!" Therefore, farmers pay great attention to specifications and quality when selling vegetables, and select good vegetables to supply to the city.

    为城市服务的榜样
    ——辽宁旅大市金县友谊人民公社发展副食品生产的成就
    张畸　刘德秀　高方
    菜果畜禽大发展
    辽宁省旅大市金县友谊人民公社建立以来，在发展副食品生产、支援城市建设方面取得了辉煌的成就。
    友谊人民公社位于金州城郊，距旅大市六十华里，四周依山临海，中为平原，气候温和，雨量充沛，适于发展园艺作物和多种经营。这个公社是在1958年9月由六个高级社正式建成的，全社共有四千一百六十户，二万二千八百二十五口人，耕地面积三万四千五百零二亩，果树十七万五千棵。
    公社成立后，为了适应工业生产发展城市人口增多和消费水平的日益提高的形势需要，认真地贯彻了郊区生产为城市服务的方针，改变了过去以粮食生产为主，而以发展副食品生产为主的方针。经过一年多的时间，充分运用人民公社的优越条件和当地的自然资源，建成了强大的副食品生产基地，成为为城市服务的一面鲜明红旗。
    由于副食品生产的发展，副食品的商品量就有了显著的增长，使产销情况发生了深刻的变化。拿金州镇来说，这个镇仅有六万五千口人，在公社化以前，当地生产的蔬菜不能满足全镇的需要，每年要从外地输入五百到六百吨菜；公社化后，当地生产的蔬菜不仅满足了全镇的需要，而且全年还供应旅大市一万二千八百吨。这个地区1955年每人平均蔬菜消费量为一百一十八斤，1957年提高到一百八十斤，1959年提高到三百三十斤。
    副食品生产的发展，进一步满足了城市人民生活日益增长的需要，密切了城乡关系，同时也增加了公社和社员的收入。例如1958年全社总收入三百八十五万三千元，扣除一切开支，分配社员部分是一百六十万零三千元，平均每人分得七十三元二角。1959年由于扩大了蔬菜、畜牧、渔业、果树等副食品的生产，总收入增加到三十三万四千六百四十七元，公共积累达到一百万零五千零一十六元，比去年增加38.1％，扣除一切支出，分给社员部分为二百三十七万四千二百一十一元，平均每人分得一百零一元，比1958年增长38％，因而有条件在收入增长的基础上实行按月付给工资的制度。截至1959年9月份的统计，付给社员工资的总额已达七十六万三千元，社员生活有了很大的提高。
    这些无可辩驳的事实，证明了人民公社这种崭新的社会组织形式，能够更好地贯彻郊区生产为城市服务的方针，同时又能增加社员收入，更快地提高社员的生活水平。
    政治挂帅　思想先行
    这个公社贯彻郊区生产为城市服务的方针，并不完全是一帆风顺的。1959年春制订生产计划的时候，少数富裕中农提出了“少种、高价、多卖钱”的论调。有的说：“城市反正得吃菜，少种点，价钱高一点卖，还不是一样能够多收入？”有的说：“生产多了，价钱低了，不一定能多收入。”个别贫农和下中农则强调多种粮食，他们说：“国家供给的粮食，总不如自己产的方便，还是少种点菜吧。”这两种主张有本质上的不同，前一种是资本主义经营思想，后一种属于小农经济的自给观点。公社党委针对这种主张及时领导农民开展了一场大辩论。广大农民以大量的事实，批驳了资本主义经营思想和小农经济的自给观点。同时，党委又引导农民算了两笔账：第一笔是政治账，算农民在工人阶级的领导下，经过一系列的斗争所取得的伟大胜利，并着重说明在社会主义建设的新情况下，进一步巩固工农联盟的重要政治意义；第二笔是经济账，算清发展副食品生产的收入，进一步说明贯彻郊区为城市服务的方针，对工人和农民两者都有利。同时，为了更有效地教育农民，又组织农民到这个社园艺管理区参观工业对农业技术和装备上的种种支援。这次参观给农民上了一次最生动的工农联盟教育课。社员反映说：“咱们使用的农具、机器，那一样不是工人制造的？没有工人的支援，农业生产也搞不好，咱们一定得多生产副食品，供应城市，支援工业生产。”通过大辩论、算账、参观等一系列的活动，使农民普遍地提高了觉悟，为发展副食品生产打下了思想基础。
    友谊公社发展副食品生产所遇到的最突出的困难是劳动力不足。工业生产大跃进，需要郊区不断补充新的劳动力，公社在这一年里支援工业建设的青壮年劳动力就有三百六十多名。由于蔬菜面积扩大，每亩菜田用工量为一百一十个左右，等于大田的十倍，劳动力就更加不足了。为了解决这一问题，公社大办集体福利事业，共建立了三十五处食堂，五十六处托儿所，二十三处幼儿园，十七处缝纫部，解放了八百六十二名妇女劳动力参加生产，不仅解决了劳动力不足的问题，并且改变了妇女在经济上和政治上的地位。再就是采用短期突击、互相协作的办法。例如八里管理区正当采摘苹果的季节，气象预报有台风，园艺管理区就抽调大批劳动力去支援，减少了损失。通过改进劳动组织，推行短期包工、按劳分配的办法，也激发社员劳动积极性，使劳动效率提高50％。此外，还开展了工具改革。园田灌溉基本上消灭了用人力浇水，多数用畜力拉水，并有五十五眼电井，每眼电井相当于十眼畜力井的灌溉效率，大大提高了劳动生产率。
    农商协作　产销结合
    加强农商协作，产销结合，是公社化后副食品生产战线上根本变化之一。由于公社成立后，实行了工、农、商、学、兵五位一体，解决了小社分散经营时的种种矛盾，实行统一领导，全面安排，进一步提高了为城市人民需要服务的质量。商业部门彻底改变了过去那种只管推销，不管生产，坐等卖货的作风，加强了生产观点和群众观点，认真贯彻了从生产入手、参与生产、扶持生产的方针。商业部门深入调查研究了城市人民的消费水平，征求对副食品的数量、品种方面的意见，然后根据国家计划帮助公社制订产销计划，和公社互相签订产销合同，产品按照公平合理的价格全部由商业部门包下来。这样就鼓舞了农民的生产积极性，解决了商业部门怕销不出去积压赔钱和农民怕生产过剩造成烂菜的“两头害怕”的顾虑。同时商业部门又派了收购员，长期驻在公社和重点管理区，深入生产过程，参与生产，扶持生产。例如1959年夏季蔬菜遭到了虫害，当时由于农药不足，商业部门主动试制了九种土农药，其中的“五一六九”农药药效很高，对扑灭虫害起了很大作用。为扶持畜牧业生产，商业部门成立了种畜场，帮助公社培育了种猪。在猪瘟防疫时期，又组织力量帮助注射疫苗，推动了公社养猪生产的发展。
    在蔬菜的收购工作中，商业部门采取了许多既有利于生产者又有利于消费者的措施，实行了“就地收购，就地检斤，就地包装，就地发运”和“直流挂钩”等作法，以店包区，以门市包队（即由蔬菜商店包管理区，零售门市部包生产队），由生产单位把蔬菜直接送到零售单位。这样作一方面减少了蔬菜的流转环节，保证了上市蔬菜的鲜嫩质量，另方面可以达到按计划上市，使旺季蔬菜不压不烂，保证了菜价的稳定，为公社增加了大量的收入。公社1958年秋季仅从代替商业部门进行蔬菜包装一项就增加了五、六千元的收入。现在社员们再不用担心旺季蔬菜集中登市造成烂菜的损失了。
    为了帮助公社发展副食品生产，商业部门还帮助公社筹集资金、兴修水利、购运生产资料，以及帮助解决发展家畜家禽的种源、饲料、防疫等问题。如公社春菜田扩大后，原来准备的架材远远不能满足需要了，商业部门便帮助他们从外地采购了六十万捆架材，解决了急需。蔬菜上市旺季时，蔬菜公司不但把自己的棚布借给公社用，还亲自派人深入田间帮助搭棚包装蔬菜。公社修建温室缺少木材，蔬菜公司便把自用的建窖和垫垛的木材拿出一部分，低价供给公社使用，积极帮助公社扩大了冬菜的生产。
    由于实行农商协作和产销结合，1959年友谊公社供应城市需要的蔬菜不但数量上比往年有了很大增加，并且初步扭转了历年蔬菜市场上淡季不足、旺季有余的局面。
      城乡关系更加密切
    人民公社化和大跃进，使工人阶级和劳动农民在经济上和政治上的联系更加密切了，工农互相支援和友谊往来更加亲密了。新型的社会主义城乡关系进入了一个新的阶段。
    随着集体化程度的逐渐扩大，国家工业对郊区生产资料供应和技术改造的扶助也越来越大。例如1955年初级社时期，国家工业供给他们的主要生产资料总产值为十六万六千七百元，1957年高级社时期达到了二十一万九千五百五十元，1959年公社化后则增加到三十一万七千九百三十元。
    从公社成立后短短的一年里，城市工业供应公社的农业机械，仅动力和排灌机械即有电动机五十五台、柴油机五台、电力抽水机三十台，还有大量廉价的电力，使公社新安装的电井比初级社、高级社几年的时间所安装的总和还多，新增加了二百八十二马力的抽水能力，一举实现菜田基本水利化，专业的蔬菜管理区基本上实现了灌溉电力化。1959年春天，正当春菜播种、出苗和果树开花的关键季节，遇到了几十年来未有的大旱，使春菜和水果、粮食的丰收受到了严重的威胁。这时，大连和金州镇的厂矿、企业、机关、部队、学校和街道居民，先后共组织了十五万六千人次下乡参加抗旱斗争，帮助战胜了干旱，保住了丰收。在日常生活中，邻近的厂矿企业和公社之间的友谊往来、互相支援更是不胜枚举。金州重型机器厂和杨家管理区，在大跃进中结成了亲密的友谊。杨家管理区打电井遇到器材不足的困难，重型机器厂便拿出十根电线杆和一千米电线来支援；由于菜田扩大后肥料不足，厂子里的大粪和炉灰便全都供给他们使用，等于给他们在工厂里建立了一座肥料库。1959年从厂子里拉回的大粪和炉灰有五、六十万斤之多。6月下旬，全区三百多亩麦田已经一片黄熟，正待收割，天气突然变化，眼看丰收的小麦就要遭到严重的损失，光靠管理区自己是力所难及的。在危急之中他们便去向重型机器厂求援，重型机器厂立即抽出四百名工人，帮助抢割抢收了两天，在雨前把三百多亩麦子全部夺到了手。社员们从心里感激地说：“不叫工人老大哥帮忙，咱们这五万斤麦子算全瞎啦！”
    公社化后，郊区农民社会主义觉悟有进一步提高，他们把增产副食品为城市服务当做自己的光荣职责，在保证城市供应和满足工人老大哥的副食品需要上也表现了高度的热情。早春城市蔬菜少的时候，农民们把早下来的黄瓜和西红柿等，都尽先供应城市，宁肯自己少吃或不吃。在农民的心目中，现在工人和农民的关系，正像三里管理区社员萧明理所说的：“我们和城市工人就像亲戚一样，走亲戚是拿点好东西好呢，还是拿点坏东西好呢？当然还是拿点好东西好！”因此农民在卖菜时都非常注意规格质量，选好菜供应城市。
