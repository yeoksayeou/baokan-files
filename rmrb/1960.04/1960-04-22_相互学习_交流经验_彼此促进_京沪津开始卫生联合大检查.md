Xinhua News Agency, April 21st. The joint major inspection of the patriotic health campaign competition in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin began simultaneously in the three cities on the 20th. This inspection will last for about a week.

On the first day of the major inspection, in Beijing, the health inspection team composed of the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and the heads of Shanghai and Tianjin, went deep into the urban people's communes, factories, government offices, schools, street canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, food and service industries, and other units in the four districts of Dongcheng, Xicheng, Xuanwu, and Chongwen for inspection. Zhao Zukang, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, Zhang Guofan, Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, and other members of the delegation, accompanied by Wang Kunlun, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and Yan Yi, Deputy Director of the Public Health Bureau, visited the Fusujing Residents' Committee, which has won the health red flag for two consecutive years. They were very interested in the street canteen at the north entrance of Zhaodengyu Road, which was run by three women. The entire canteen was bright and clean, without any grease. The inspection team expressed satisfaction with the Renli Flax Textile Factory's practice of "hygiene for production, and emphasizing hygiene in production." Although this factory's material conditions were relatively poor, the workers resolutely implemented the policy of hygiene serving production and have been repeatedly rated as a health red flag unit in the city and the national textile industry. At the end of the inspection of each unit, the inspection team held discussions with the personnel of these units and put forward suggestions for improvement on the shortcomings of the sanitary work of these units.

In Shanghai, the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Inspection Team and the health visiting and inspection teams from Beijing and Tianjin went to factories, troops, and schools in four groups for inspection. Yan Jingqing, Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau, led the inspection team to the Dachang Livestock Product Processing Factory, where no flies were seen. This factory vigorously carried out technological innovation this year, creating new mechanized equipment and new processing methods such as automatic pig bristle separators and chemical treatment of rawhide, which greatly reduced labor intensity and improved environmental sanitation. Workers' occupational diseases have also been greatly reduced. Yan Jingqing said: It is an outstanding achievement of the workers that no flies are seen in the tannery. The team led by Zhou Shuta, Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, carefully visited and inspected the roads, sewers, and ditches in the Shanghai Ferroalloy Factory, and expressed their appreciation one by one. Zhou Shuta believes that it is a good experience to use iron gauze to isolate the sewers in the factory to prevent mosquitoes and flies from breeding.

In Tianjin, the health visiting and inspection team composed of heads of relevant departments in Beijing, Shanghai and the Central Government, accompanied by Lou Ningxian, Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, Yang Zhenya, Director of the Tianjin Municipal Public Health Bureau, and others, divided into three groups and inspected the Xing'an Road People's Commune in Heping District, the Guanyinhao vegetable market, the Hongqi Restaurant in Hongqiao District, the Wenquan Bathhouse, the Bird Market, the Shenjiatai residential area in Nankai District, the "March 8th" Kindergarten, and a factory. The inspection team expressed satisfaction with the great achievements made by these units in eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene. The hygiene conditions of the collective production and living organizations such as the canteen, nursery, production workshop, sewing group, and health station of the Julong branch of the Xing'an Road People's Commune were very good. The nursery was clean and bright everywhere, and the children grew very fat. The inspection team believed that the children lived better here than at home. The public canteen was also very clean and hygienic, with more than a dozen varieties of staple and non-staple foods every day. All the staple food was made by machines, which not only saved labor but also improved operating hygiene conditions. The hygiene work of the Hongqi Restaurant in Hongqiao District has been regularized. The cooking utensils, utensils, tables and chairs are spotless, and the tableware is thoroughly disinfected every time it is used. The restaurant also uses various forms to publicize hygiene knowledge to customers at any time and anywhere. The inspection team believes that the hygiene of this restaurant is very good.

During the joint major inspection of the three cities, more than 200 units will be inspected.

    京沪津开始卫生联合大检查
    新华社21日讯　北京、上海、天津爱国卫生运动竞赛的联合大检查，于20日起分别在三市同时开始。这次检查将进行一个星期左右。
    大检查的第一天，在北京，由中央爱国卫生运动委员会和上海、天津两市的负责人组成的卫生检查团，分别深入到东城、西城、宣武、崇文四个区的城市人民公社、工厂、机关、学校、街道食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、饮食和服务行业等单位进行检查。上海市副市长赵祖康、天津市副市长张国藩以及代表团其他成员，在北京市副市长王昆仑、公共卫生局副局长阎毅陪同下，参观了连续两年来获得卫生红旗的福绥境居民委员会，他们对由三个妇女负责经办的赵登禹路北口的街道食堂很感兴趣，整个食堂窗明几净，一点油垢也没有。检查团对仁立麻纺织厂“卫生为生产，生产讲卫生”的做法表示满意。这个工厂物质条件比较差，但职工们坚决贯彻执行卫生为生产服务的方针，多次被评为全市和全国纺织业的卫生红旗单位。检查团在每一个单位检查结束的时候，都同这些单位的人员进行座谈，对这些单位卫生工作不足的地方提出了改进意见。
    在上海，中央爱国卫生运动检查团和北京、天津两市的卫生参观检查团分四路到工厂、部队、学校进行检查，北京市公共卫生局局长严镜清带领的检查团团员来到了大场畜产品加工厂，在这里没有见到苍蝇。这个工厂今年大搞技术革新，创造了猪鬃自动分离机和化学处理硝皮等新的机械化设备和新的加工方法，大大减轻了劳动强度，改善了环境卫生，工人们的职业病也大大减少，严镜清表示：在制革工厂中见不到苍蝇这是工人们的出色成绩。以天津市副市长周叔弢带领的一路，仔细参观和检查了上海铁合金厂内的道路、下水道、阴沟、食堂等，一一表示赞许。周叔弢认为，厂内用铁纱隔住阴沟，不让蚊蝇孳生是个很好的经验。
    在天津，以北京、上海和中央有关部门负责人组成的卫生参观检查团，由天津市副市长娄凝先、天津市公共卫生局局长杨振亚等人陪同，分成三个组，检查了天津市和平区兴安路人民公社、官银号菜市场、红桥区红旗饭庄、温泉澡堂、鸟市市场、南开区沈家台居民区、“三八”幼儿园和一个工厂。检查团对这些单位除四害讲卫生已取得很大成绩表示满意。兴安路人民公社巨龙分社的食堂、托儿所、生产车间、缝纫组、保健站等集体生产、生活组织的卫生状况都很好，托儿所处处干净明亮，小孩长得很胖，检查团认为小孩在这里生活得比家里还好；公共食堂也很清洁卫生，每天主副食花样有十几种，制作主食全部用机器，不仅节省了劳动力，而且改善了操作卫生条件。红桥区红旗饭庄的卫生工作已经做到经常化，炊具、用具、桌椅等一尘不染，食具每用一次就彻底消毒一次，饭庄还采用各种形式，随时随地向顾客宣传卫生知识。检查团认为这个饭庄的卫生很好。
    三个市的联合大检查中，将检查二百多个单位。
