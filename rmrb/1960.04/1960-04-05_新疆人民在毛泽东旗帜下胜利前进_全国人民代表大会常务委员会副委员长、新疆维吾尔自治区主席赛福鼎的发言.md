Chairman, fellow representatives:
	I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 State Final Accounts and the 1960 State Budget, and fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China.
	As Vice Premier Li Fuchun stated in his report, in recent years, especially in 1958 and 1959, we have achieved significant and historic victories in all aspects of the national economy. Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the people of the whole country, with soaring revolutionary zeal, have realized the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, thereby enabling our country's socialist construction to develop at an unprecedented high speed. This turning-point great victory in the development of socialist construction is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction. This victory has further inspired the people of all ethnic groups. "Three cheers" eloquently demonstrate the ambition of our people and have become the magic weapon for our heroic people to carry out revolution and construction. We firmly believe that the 1960 National Economic Plan tasks proposed by Vice Premier Li Fuchun in his report will certainly be completed and overfulfilled at the speed of a continued Great Leap Forward. The correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people across the country, the new situation favorable to us in all aspects, our already increasingly solid economic foundation, the consolidated unity of the people nationwide, and the rich experience we have gained in our work are all solid guarantees for the sustained Great Leap Forward of our socialist construction and the victory of all our undertakings.

	The Great Victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes Has Brought Tremendous Changes to Xinjiang
	Under the leadership and care of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the support of fraternal provinces and regions throughout the country, the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have, in recent years, especially in the past two or three years, achieved tremendous victories like other provinces and regions. The great victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes has brought tremendous changes to Xinjiang, and an unprecedentedly good situation has emerged in politics, economy, and other aspects. Based on the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in 1958, a continued Great Leap Forward was realized in 1959. It greatly accelerated the construction of our economy, culture, and other aspects, promoted the high-speed development of productive forces, and thus brought about unprecedented and tremendous changes in the economy, culture, and other aspects. Taking industrial construction as an example, before liberation, Xinjiang only had fourteen small factories with outdated equipment. After liberation, by 1957, the number of newly built industrial and mining enterprises had developed to 259. After another two years of sustained Great Leap Forward, 1,513 modern factories have been built, including heavy industries such as iron and steel, petroleum, non-ferrous metals, tractor manufacturing, coal, cement, and electricity, as well as light industries such as textile, printing and dyeing, sugar making, and paper making. With the great development of the national economy, transportation and commerce have also been greatly developed.
	Agriculture and animal husbandry are also developing at the speed of a leap forward. In 1959, the cultivated land area had expanded to more than 41 million mu, an increase of 10.78 million mu compared with 1957, and an increase of 23.89 million mu compared with before liberation. Grain output reached 7 billion jin, an increase of 72% compared with 1957 and an increase of 244% compared with before liberation. The total output value of industry and agriculture increased by an average of 37.3% per year during the two years of the Great Leap Forward, which is more than twice the average annual increase of 12.4% during the First Five-Year Plan period. In 1959, the average grain per capita had increased by 366 jin compared with 1957. Animal husbandry production has also developed significantly.
	While the Great Leap Forward in economic construction was taking place, the education and culture sectors also achieved a Great Leap Forward. There are currently nine universities and colleges, and more than 4,500 primary and secondary schools in the region, with more than 957,000 students, accounting for one-sixth of the region's total population. Primary school education has been basically popularized. The work of eliminating illiteracy is advancing at the speed of a leap forward, and the number of people participating in literacy and various levels of spare-time schools has reached more than half of the adult population. Nearly half of the young and middle-aged people in the region have shed the label of illiteracy. Scientific research, culture and art, and health care have also developed rapidly.
	During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the people's communes were universally realized in the agricultural and pastoral areas of Xinjiang. After the establishment of the people's communes, they quickly promoted the great development of various production undertakings, especially agriculture and animal husbandry, making the agricultural and pastoral areas take on a new look. More than a year of practice has fully demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, proving that they are a great organizational force for us to realize the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in a organized way in rural and pastoral areas. Many things that were previously impossible to do were done, and done well and quickly. Many difficulties and contradictions that could not be solved in the past have now been properly resolved. Only communization can more perfectly and quickly realize the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. Facts have proved that only the people's communes can fundamentally change the backwardness of the economy and culture in pastoral areas. With the communization, the vast majority of herdsmen have generally settled down, basically ending the nomadic life of moving with the water and grass for generations. Therefore, the pastoral areas have generally seen a good scene of prosperity for both people and livestock. The universal implementation of the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry means that areas that did not grow grain or grew very little grain in the past can now not only generally achieve self-sufficiency in grain and feed, but some communes also have surplus grain. Many new towns have been established on the grasslands, and 90% of school-age children in pastoral areas have been enrolled in schools. Because the people's communes have vigorously carried out basic agricultural and pastoral construction and vigorously organized production, agriculture and animal husbandry have developed rapidly, and the income of the communes and their members has generally increased. Compared with 1958, the total agricultural output value of the people's communes increased by 22.18% in 1959, the output value of commune-run industries and sideline industries increased by 55.45%, and the personal income of commune members increased by 28%. More than 90% of commune members increased their income compared with 1958. Nearly 30,000 canteens across the region have generally won the support of the people and are becoming more and more consolidated. Now the benefits of the people's communes have taken root in the hearts of the people. Many commune members say: "The commune is a golden bridge to happiness." The songs of "The People's Commune is Good" sung by the people of all ethnic groups resound throughout the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains.
	The above-mentioned great achievements fully prove with iron-like facts that the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are completely in line with the actual situation in Xinjiang and are completely in line with the aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups in our country and the requirements of socialist construction. We must adhere to these three magic weapons and achieve greater victories in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. It is even more important to develop socialist construction at a higher speed and proportionally in the Xinjiang region. If the whole country is "poor and blank," then Xinjiang is "poorer and blanker." Due to historical reasons, Xinjiang is generally behind the inland provinces and regions in terms of economy and culture. Since liberation, Xinjiang's construction has been developing at a high speed, and some projects have increased several times, but other advanced provinces and regions are also advancing rapidly. Therefore, we must achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward and move forward at a faster pace in order to gradually change the backward situation and enable backward ethnic groups to gradually catch up with the development level of advanced ethnic groups in terms of economy and culture. Of course, such a high speed must be built on the basis of objectively possible conditions. We now have the conditions for high-speed development, and these conditions are becoming more and more sufficient.
	While achieving great victories on the economic construction front, we have also achieved great victories on the political and ideological front. After the struggle against the bourgeois rightists, against local nationalism, and against right-leaning opportunism, the ideological outlook of the vast number of cadres and masses has been renewed, their communist awareness has been further enhanced, the unity of all ethnic groups has been greatly strengthened, and the enthusiasm for revolution and construction has been greatly encouraged.

	Xinjiang's Ethnic Relations Have Undergone Profound Changes of Major Historical Significance, and Socialist Ethnic Relations Have Been Formed
	Due to the great victory of socialist revolution and socialist construction in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and due to the continuous Great Leap Forward in economic, cultural, and other aspects of construction, with the emergence of new relationships between people, Xinjiang's ethnic relations have undergone profound changes of major historical significance, that is, socialist ethnic relations have been formed, and the unity and friendship among all ethnic groups based on socialism and communism have been further enhanced. The imbalance in the political, economic, and cultural development among various ethnic groups has been greatly changed. The ethnic issue has been basically resolved. After ten years of revolution and construction, the political awareness of all ethnic minorities has been greatly improved. The people of all ethnic minorities have deeply realized from their own personal experiences that only by firmly following the Party and Chairman Mao, firmly implementing the Party's ethnic policies, and firmly implementing the Party's General Line can we accelerate socialist construction and rapidly change the backward state of the economy and culture in their ethnic regions, thereby enabling their ethnic groups to join the ranks of advanced ethnic groups. We have a better understanding that consolidating the unity of the motherland and strengthening ethnic unity are important guarantees for the victory of all our undertakings. Practical experience has also made us better understand that local nationalism is a major enemy of socialism. It undermines the unity of the motherland, undermines ethnic unity, opposes socialism, and opposes the Han people. In short, it violates the great aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups and is therefore reactionary. The people of Xinjiang resolutely and ruthlessly carried out the struggle against local nationalism. The people of all ethnic groups deeply understand that without overcoming local nationalism and removing it from our path of socialist revolution and socialist construction, it is impossible to smoothly carry out socialist construction in ethnic regions. Therefore, after achieving great victories on the economic front, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have also achieved great victories on the political and ideological front, resolutely carried out the struggle against local nationalism, and achieved a decisive victory. This is the most basic factor in the formation of new socialist ethnic relations among all ethnic groups. The fate of the people of all ethnic groups in our country has always been consistent. The people of all ethnic groups work together with one heart and one mind, have achieved great victories, and are continuing to seize even greater victories in revolution and construction. In the future, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and with the help of the great Han people, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will be closely united in the big family of the People's Republic of China, working together to victoriously realize socialism and communism. Now, everywhere in our autonomous region, we can see many touching facts about the socialist ethnic relations and communist cooperation that have already formed among the people of all ethnic groups. The mutual assistance and cooperation in production and construction, the mutual trust, close unity, mutual encouragement, and mutual learning among ethnic groups are developing day by day. In factories, workers of all ethnic groups learn technology and advanced techniques from each other, and compete with each other. With the enthusiastic help of Han technicians, many ethnic minority workers have been trained to become skilled workers. Workers of all ethnic groups not only help each other in production, but also care for each other in life. During the Eid al-Adha festival, Han workers work as usual so that ethnic minority workers can take a holiday; during the Spring Festival, ethnic minority workers work as usual so that Han workers can take a holiday. In schools, Han teachers and students and ethnic minority teachers and students study each other, help each other, and make progress together. A ethnic minority student at Xinjiang College broke his leg and could not move for half a year. Thanks to the Han students helping him make up lessons every day, his grades were still very good. In the unity and mutual assistance of all ethnic groups, there have also been many heroic deeds of self-sacrifice. For example, a Han youth at the Gongnaisi Stud Farm in Ili fell into the water, and Ali Skhan, a Kazakh herdsman, sacrificed his life to save him. A Kazakh woman in Wenquan County was in critical condition due to excessive blood loss during childbirth. Guo Zhonghe, the director of the county's Propaganda Department, personally led cadres to donate blood and save the woman's life. These examples show that this kind of ethnic relationship is not just a general relationship of ethnic unity, but a lofty communist friendship. The unity and mutual assistance of all ethnic groups is also prominently manifested in the warm welcome and active assistance to the young people who support the construction of the frontier. The people of all ethnic groups recognize that the entry of Han youths into Xinjiang is a great assistance from the Party and the Han people to the construction of our autonomous region. They actively vacated houses for them, and some even built new houses for them, welcoming, comforting, and giving gifts to help solve difficulties in many ways. They are truly as close as brothers and sisters. An old man named Hulebayi in the Ussu Dongfeng People's Commune thought that the three yuan his wife sent was too little, and personally gave his newly sewn silk quilt to the young people who entered Xinjiang. Cultural exchanges are being widely carried out between the Han and ethnic minorities. Cadres and the masses generally learn each other's languages. The current Uyghur and Kazakh languages can no longer fully meet the needs of the Uyghur and Kazakh people, and can no longer meet the requirements of language development. Therefore, reforming the current script, adopting a new script, and adopting the spelling method of the Chinese Pinyin scheme used by the Han people, who account for the majority of the population in our country, has become an urgent requirement of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The script reform committee of our autonomous region has drafted and adopted a trial implementation plan for the new Uyghur and Kazakh scripts based on the Chinese Pinyin scheme, and has already begun trial implementation. New words and terms necessary in ethnic minority languages are determined to borrow Chinese vocabulary and terms. The adoption and trial implementation of this new script plan, borrowing Chinese to enrich the Uyghur and Kazakh ethnic languages, is a major revolution in the history of the development of Uyghur and Kazakh languages and scripts, and a historical victory in the cultural revolution in ethnic minority areas. This victory is of extremely great significance for developing the economy in ethnic areas, strengthening ethnic cultural exchanges, further promoting the consolidation and development of new ethnic relations, and further consolidating the unity of the people of all ethnic groups to work together and realize common aspirations. At the same time, it has created favorable conditions for ethnic groups to learn each other's languages.
	Facts fully prove that a new socialist relationship among all ethnic groups has been formed in our region. However, we are not satisfied with this. We must vigorously consolidate and develop the new relationship among all ethnic groups, further strengthen the unity, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation among all ethnic groups, and thoroughly resolve the ethnic issue in accordance with Marxist-Leninist principles.
	After ten years of revolution and construction, especially after two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, a very good political and economic situation has emerged in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes have taken root in the hearts of the people, and the people of all ethnic groups are eager to accelerate socialist construction. With the deepening of the socialist revolution and the victorious development of socialist construction, new socialist and communist cooperative relations have emerged among all ethnic groups. A large number of ethnic cadres have grown up. At the same time, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has been opened to Hami, and will be opened to Urumqi this year, and will continue to extend westward; Xinjiang also has abundant resources, which are very favorable conditions and must be fully utilized. The correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is the fundamental guarantee for us to successfully carry out our construction cause. The only thing missing in the large-scale socialist construction in Xinjiang, and also the most important factor in revolution and construction, is labor. Thanks to the special care of the Central Government and the support of fraternal provinces and regions, this problem has also begun to be resolved.

	Continuing the Leap Forward, Building Xinjiang into One of the Country's Industrial Bases and an Important Cotton-Planting Base
	The above situation marks that the socialist construction of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has entered a new stage of development, indicating that Xinjiang has unlimited and bright development prospects. In such a good situation, our task is to better implement the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and a whole set of "walking on two legs" policies, continuously achieve the Great Leap Forward, and build Xinjiang into one of the country's industrial bases for iron and steel, petroleum, coal, non-ferrous metals, machinery, textiles, sugar making, and other industries, as well as a cotton-planting base. This is a long-term struggle task, but we have full confidence and determination to complete this task.
	In order to successfully complete the tasks in the future, we must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of victory. The historical experience of our country's revolution and construction fully proves that adhering to the direction of Mao Zedong Thought will surely lead to victory; conversely, deviating from the direction of Mao Zedong Thought will surely lead to mistakes. Mao Zedong Thought is the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and is the creative development of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism in the practice of the Chinese revolution and construction. To be a true Marxist-Leninist, to realize socialism and communism in our country as early and smoothly as possible, we must study Mao Zedong Thought well and earnestly, and arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Now, the vast number of cadres, workers, and intellectuals in our autonomous region have widely launched a movement to study Mao Zedong Thought. We will take all measures to make a Great Leap Forward in the study of Mao Zedong Thought, and we will surely be able to learn Mao Zedong Thought well.
	This year is the third year of realizing a continuous leap forward, and it is an important year for preparing for large-scale economic construction in the future. Our Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region must strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. This year, our most important task is to strengthen the agricultural front and accelerate the development of agriculture. The Great Leap Forward in the past two years has made us deeply realize that the great development of agriculture can rapidly promote the great development of industry. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. If agriculture is not done well, it will be difficult to do more industry. With the rapid westward extension of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the arrival of the situation of great industrial development, we must not only fully meet the needs of economic construction and people's lives for grain and other agricultural products, but also have a large amount of grain and other agricultural product reserves. To this end, we must earnestly implement the policy of expanding cultivated land and increasing yield per unit area simultaneously, developing food crops and developing cash crops simultaneously, and developing agriculture and developing animal husbandry simultaneously, under the premise of taking grain as the key, to accelerate the development of agricultural and pastoral production. We plan to increase grain by 17%, cotton by 24.2%, oil crops by 22.5%, and livestock by 12% this year on the basis of last year's production. In order to achieve these targets, we must strengthen the leadership of the people's communes, rely on the strength of the people's communes, vigorously reclaim wasteland, expand the sown area; and at the same time, take soil as the key, focus on water and fertilizer, comprehensively and appropriately implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in accordance with local conditions, and accelerate agricultural mechanization.
	While emphasizing the need to vigorously grasp agriculture, we must continue to actively develop industry, adhere to the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and combine the accelerated development of agriculture with the accelerated development of industry. In industrial construction, continue to implement the policy of taking steel as the key and simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, and simultaneously developing large, medium, and small industries (in Xinjiang, we have particularly focused on small and medium-sized industries), first of all, firmly grasp the production and basic construction of the iron and steel industry, and accelerate the development of the machinery industry to equip other industries, support agriculture, and support transportation. Transportation is a weak link in the development of the national economy in our region. We must continue to implement the policy of the whole people running transportation, expand the construction of transportation, combine indigenous and foreign methods, rapidly increase transportation capacity, and firmly grasp small indigenous groups and small foreign groups of railways. While carrying out the above-mentioned work, vigorously promote the rapid development of finance, trade, science, education, culture, health, and other undertakings, and strive to achieve a continued leap forward in all aspects of construction.
	This year, the situation in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is extremely good, just like the whole country. The industrial, agricultural, and other fronts have universally realized a "good start" and continue to achieve victories. The people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and with the help of fraternal provinces and regions, are greatly boosting their energy and full of confidence to victoriously achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, to victoriously complete the 1960 National Economic Plan, and to strive for the complete victory of socialism and the great cause of communism in the future!

    新疆人民在毛泽东旗帜下胜利前进
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、新疆维吾尔自治区主席赛福鼎的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告，完全同意中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    正如李富春副总理在他的报告中讲到的，几年来，特别是1958年和1959年，我们在国民经济的各个方面都取得了重大的、历史性的胜利，全国人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，以冲天的革命干劲，实现了大跃进和人民公社化，从而使我国社会主义建设得到了空前的高速度发展。社会主义建设发展中的这一转折性的伟大胜利，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这一胜利更加鼓舞了各族人民。“三个万岁”雄辩地显示了我国人民的雄心壮志，成为英雄的我国人民进行革命和建设的法宝。我们坚信，李富春副总理在报告中提出的1960年国民经济计划任务一定能够以继续大跃进的速度完成和超额完成。党中央和毛主席的正确领导，全国人民的革命干劲，各方面有利于我们的新形势，我们已有的日益坚实的经济基础，全国人民巩固的团结一致，以及我们在工作中所取得的丰富经验，这些就是我们社会主义建设持续大跃进和一切事业胜利的巩固的保证。
    总路线、大跃进和人民公社的伟大胜利使新疆的面貌发生了极其巨大的变化
    新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民，在党和毛主席的领导关怀下，在全国各兄弟省区的支持下，几年来，特别是近二、三年来，同其它省区一样取得了极其巨大的胜利。总路线、大跃进和人民公社的伟大胜利使新疆的面貌发生了极其巨大的变化，在政治、经济等方面都出现了空前良好的形势。在1958年社会主义建设大跃进的成就和经验的基础上，又实现了1959年的继续大跃进。它大大加快了我们的经济文化以及其他各方面的建设，促进了生产力的高速度发展，从而在经济文化等方面，带来了史无前例的巨大的变化。以工业建设来说，解放前新疆只有设备陈旧的小型工厂十四个，解放后截至1957年，新建工矿企业发展到二百五十九个。又经过两年持续大跃进，已建起现代化的工厂一千五百一十三个，其中有钢铁、石油、有色金属、拖拉机制造、煤炭、水泥、电力等重工业和纺织、印染、制糖、造纸等轻工业。随着国民经济的大发展，交通运输和商业工作也得到了大发展。
    农牧业也是以跃进的速度在发展着。1959年，耕地面积已扩大到四千一百多万亩，比1957年增加了一千零七十八万亩，比解放前增加二千三百八十九万亩。粮食产量达到七十亿斤，比1957年增加72％，比解放前增加244％。工农业总产值，在大跃进的两年中平均每年增长37.3％，比第一个五年计划期间平均每年增长12.4％高出二倍以上。1959年粮食按人口平均已比1957年增加了三百六十六斤。牧业生产也有了显著的发展。
    在经济建设大跃进的同时，教育文化事业也实现了大跃进。全区现有高等学校九所，中、小学四千五百多所，在校学生九十五万七千多人，占全区总人口六分之一。小学教育已基本上普及了。扫盲工作正以跃进的速度向前推进，参加扫盲和各级业余学校学习的人数已达成年人一半以上，全区已有近半数的青壮年脱掉了文盲的帽子。科学研究、文化艺术、卫生事业也都获得了迅速的发展。
    在1958年的大跃进中，新疆农牧区普遍实现了人民公社化。人民公社成立后，就迅速促进了各项生产事业特别是农牧业的大发展，使农牧区的面貌焕然一新。一年多的实践充分显示了人民公社的无比优越性，证明它是我们在农村牧区有组织地实现社会主义建设大跃进的伟大组织力量。许多过去无力兴办的事情办起来了，而且办得好，办得快。许多过去解决不了的困难、矛盾，现在得到了妥善的解决。只有公社化，才能在农业上更完满地、迅速地实现八字宪法。事实证明，只有人民公社才能从根本上改变牧区经济、文化的落后面貌。随着人民公社化，广大牧民普遍实行了定居，基本上结束了祖祖辈辈逐水草而居的游牧生活，因而牧区普遍出现了人畜两旺的美好景象。普遍实行农牧结合，过去不种粮食或很少种粮食的地区，现在不只是一般可以做到粮食、饲料自给，有的社还有余粮。草原上已建立起许多新的城镇，牧区90％的学龄儿童已经入学。人民公社由于大兴农牧业基本建设，大力组织生产，就使农牧业得到迅速的发展，公社和社员的收入普遍增加。1959年同1958年比较，人民公社的农业总产值增长了22.18％，社办工业和副业产值增长了55.45％，社员个人收入增长28％，90％以上的社员都比1958年增加了收入。全区近三万个食堂普遍获得了人民拥护，并且愈来愈巩固。现在人民公社的好处已经深入人心，许多社员说：“公社就是通向幸福的金桥梁”。各族人民欢唱“人民公社好”的歌声，响彻天山南北。
    上述伟大成就，以铁一般的事实充分证明了总路线、大跃进、人民公社是完全符合新疆地区的实际情况的，是完全符合我国各族人民的心愿和社会主义建设的要求的。我们要坚持这三个法宝，在新疆维吾尔自治区取得更大的胜利。在新疆地区以更高的速度按比例发展社会主义建设更为重要，如果说全国是“一穷二白”，那么，新疆是“更穷更白”。由于历史的原因，新疆在经济和文化方面一般说比内地省区落后。解放以来新疆建设就在高速度发展，而有些项目在成数倍地增长，但是其它各先进省区也在快速前进，所以我们必须实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进，以更快的速度前进，才能逐步改变落后面貌，使落后的民族在经济上、文化上逐步赶上先进民族的发展水平。当然这样的高速度是要建筑在客观可能条件基础上的。我们现在已经具备了高速度发展的条件，并且这些条件还在愈来愈加充分。
    在经济建设战线上取得伟大胜利的同时，我们在政治思想战线上也取得了伟大的胜利。经过反对资产阶级右派、反对地方民族主义和反对右倾机会主义之后，广大干部和群众思想面貌为之一新，进一步提高了共产主义觉悟，大大加强了各民族的团结，大大鼓舞了革命和建设的干劲。
    新疆民族关系已经发生具有重大历史意义的深刻变化，社会主义的民族关系形成了
    由于新疆维吾尔自治区社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，由于经济文化等各方面建设的连续大跃进，随着人与人之间新的关系的出现，新疆的民族关系已经发生了具有重大历史意义的深刻变化，即社会主义的民族关系形成了，各民族之间建立在社会主义、共产主义基础上的团结和友谊更加增强了。各民族间政治、经济、文化发展不平衡状态已有很大的改变。民族问题已获得了基本解决。经过十年来的革命和建设，各少数民族的政治觉悟普遍地大大提高了，各少数民族人民从自己亲身体验中，深深认识到：只有坚决地跟着党和毛主席，坚决执行党的民族政策，坚决执行党的总路线，才能加速社会主义建设，迅速改变本民族地区经济文化的落后状态，从而使本民族跻于先进民族行列。我们更好地认识到巩固祖国统一、增强民族团结，是我们一切事业取得胜利的重要保证。实践经验又使我们更好地懂得了地方民族主义是社会主义的大敌，它破坏祖国统一，破坏民族团结，反对社会主义，反对汉族人民。总之，它是违反各族人民的伟大愿望的，因而是反动的。新疆人民坚决地无情地进行了反对地方民族主义的斗争。各族人民深深了解，不克服地方民族主义和从我们的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的道路上扫除它，在民族地区要顺利地进行社会主义建设是不可能的。所以新疆各族人民继经济战线上取得伟大胜利之后，又取得了政治思想战线上的伟大胜利，坚决进行了反对地方民族主义的斗争并取得了决定性的胜利。这是各民族之间形成新的社会主义民族关系的最基本的因素。我国各族人民的命运从来就是一致的。各族人民同心同德，共同奋斗，取得了伟大的胜利并且正在继续夺取革命和建设的更伟大胜利，今后，新疆各族人民，在党和毛主席的领导下、在伟大的汉族人民的帮助下，将紧紧地团结在中华人民共和国大家庭里，共同奋斗，胜利实现社会主义和共产主义。现在我们自治区到处都可以看到各族人民之间已经形成的社会主义民族关系和共产主义大协作的许许多多的动人事实。在生产建设中的互助合作，各民族间的互相信任、亲密团结、互相鼓励、互相学习的关系日益发展。在工厂里，各民族工人互相学技术，学先进，互相竞赛，在汉族技工的热情帮助下，许多少数民族工人已经培养成为技术工人。各民族工人不只是在生产中互助，在生活上也是互相关怀的，肉孜节时，汉族工人照常工作，让民族工人休假；春节时，民族工人照常工作，让汉族工人休假。在学校里，汉族师生和民族师生，互相研究、互相帮助，共同进步。新疆学院一个民族学生把腿摔坏了，半年不能行动，由于汉族学生每天帮助补课，他的功课仍然很好。在各民族的团结互助中，还出现了不少舍己为人的英雄事迹。例如，伊犁巩乃斯种羊场一汉族青年失足落水，哈族牧工阿力斯汉为抢救他而牺牲了自己的生命。温泉县一哈族妇女因分娩失血过多，生命垂危，县委宣传部长郭中和同志亲自带领干部去输血，救活了这个妇女。这些事例说明，这种民族关系已不是一般的民族团结的关系，而是崇高的共产主义的友谊。各民族的团结互助，还突出地表现在热烈欢迎和积极帮助支援边疆建设青壮年的方面。各族人民认识到：汉族青壮年进疆是党和汉族人民对我们自治区建设的巨大援助，积极地为他们腾房屋，有的还为他们盖新房，欢迎、慰问，赠送礼品，多方面帮助解决困难，真是情同手足，亲如兄弟。乌苏东风人民公社名叫胡勒巴依的老人，嫌他老婆送三块钱太少，亲自把自己新缝的绸被子送给进疆青年。汉族和少数民族之间正在广泛进行着文化交流。干部和群众普遍互相学习语言。现行的维吾尔、哈萨克族文字已经不能充分适应维吾尔、哈萨克族人民的需要，已经不能满足语言发展的要求。因而，改革现行文字，采用新文字，采用占我国人口多数的主体民族——汉族人民所采用的汉语拼音方案的拼写方式，已经成为新疆各族人民的迫切要求。我们自治区文字改革委员会已拟定和通过了以汉语拼音方案为基础的维、哈文新文字试行方案，并已经开始试行。少数民族语言中所必需的新词术语确定借用汉语的词汇和术语。这个新文字方案的通过和试行，借用汉语来丰富维、哈民族语言，是维吾尔、哈萨克族语言文字发展史上的一次重大革命，是文化革命在少数民族地区的一次具有历史意义的胜利。这一胜利，对于发展民族地区的经济，加强民族文化交流，进一步促进新的民族关系的巩固和发展，进一步巩固各族人民的团结，共同奋斗，实现共同愿望，则具有极其重大的意义。同时，对各民族互相学习语言创造了良好的条件。
    事实充分证明，我区已经形成了各民族之间新的社会主义的关系。但是，我们并不以此为满足。我们还要大力巩固和发展各民族之间新的关系，进一步加强各民族的团结友爱、互助合作，遵循马克思列宁主义原则彻底解决民族问题。
    新疆维吾尔自治区经过十年来的革命和建设，尤其是经过两年来的连续大跃进，已经出现了非常良好的政治经济形势。总路线、大跃进、人民公社已经深入人心，各族人民迫切要求加快社会主义建设。随着社会主义革命的深入和社会主义建设的胜利发展，各民族之间出现了新的社会主义和共产主义互助关系。民族干部已经大批地成长起来。同时，兰新铁路已经通车到哈密，今年将通车到乌鲁木齐，并将继续向西伸延；新疆并有丰富的资源，这些都是十分有利的条件，必须充分利用。而党中央和毛主席的正确领导，又是我们胜利地进行建设事业的根本保证。新疆大规模进行社会主义建设所唯一缺少的、也是革命和建设中最重要的一个因素就是劳动力。由于中央的特别关怀和各兄弟省区的支援，这个问题也开始解决了。
    持续跃进，把新疆建设成为祖国的工业基地之一和重要的植棉基地
    上述情况，标志着新疆维吾尔自治区的社会主义建设已经进入一个新的发展阶段，表明新疆有无限光明的发展前途。在这样大好形势下，我们的任务是：更好地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，持续不断地实现大跃进，把新疆建设成为祖国的钢铁、石油、煤炭、有色金属、机械、纺织、制糖等工业基地之一和植棉基地。这是一个长期奋斗的任务，但是我们有充分的信心和决心完成这一任务。
    为了胜利完成今后任务，必须高举毛泽东思想的红旗。毛泽东思想就是胜利的旗帜。我国革命和建设的历史经验充分证明，坚持毛泽东思想的方向，就一定胜利；反之，离开了毛泽东思想的方向，就一定犯错误。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实践的结合，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理在中国革命和建设实践中的创造性的发展。要作一个真正的马克思列宁主义者，要想在我国及早地顺利地实现社会主义和共产主义，就必须很好地认真地学习毛泽东思想，以毛泽东思想来武装自己。现在我们自治区的广大干部职工和知识分子，已广泛开展了学习毛泽东思想的运动。我们将采取一切措施，在毛泽东思想的学习中也来个大跃进，我们一定能够学好毛泽东思想。
    今年是实现连续跃进的第三年，是为今后大规模的经济建设作准备的重要的一年，我们新疆维吾尔自治区要为实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗。今年我们最重要的任务就是要加强农业战线，加速发展农业。两年来的大跃进使我们深深体会到，农业的大发展，就能迅速促进工业的大发展。农业是国民经济的基础，如果农业没有搞好，要想多搞工业是有困难的。随着兰新铁路的迅速向西延伸，工业大发展形势的到来，我们不仅要充分满足经济建设和人民生活对粮食及其它农产品的需要，还必须有大量的粮食及其它农产品的储备。为此，必须在以粮为纲的前提下，认真执行扩大耕地与提高单位面积产量同时并举、发展粮食作物与发展经济作物同时并举、发展农业与发展牧业同时并举的方针，加速发展农牧业生产。我们计划在去年生产的基础上，今年粮食增加17％，棉花增加24.2％，油料增加22.5％，牲畜增加12％。为实现这些指标，必须加强对人民公社的领导，依靠人民公社的力量，大力开荒，扩大播种面积；同时要以土为纲，以水肥为重点，全面地、因地制宜地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，加速进行农业机械化。
    在强调狠抓农业的同时，我们要继续积极地发展工业，坚持工业农业同时并举的方针，使加快发展农业和加快发展工业相结合。在工业建设中，继续执行以钢为纲和发展重工业与发展轻工业同时并举、大中小工业同时并举的方针（在新疆我们特别狠抓了中小型工业），首先抓紧钢铁工业的生产和基本建设，加快机械工业的发展，以装备其他工业、支援农业和交通运输业。交通运输，是我区发展国民经济中的一个薄弱环节，我们要继续执行全民办交通的方针，扩大交通运输的建设，土洋并举，迅速增强运输力量，狠抓小土群、小洋群铁路。在进行上述工作的同时，大力促进财贸、科学、教育、文化、卫生等事业的迅速发展，力争实现各方面建设的继续跃进。
    今年，新疆维吾尔自治区和全国一样形势极好。工农业战线和其他各个战线普遍实现了“开门红”，并继续取得胜利。新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民正和全国人民一起，在党中央和毛主席的领导与各兄弟省区的帮助下，大鼓干劲，满怀信心，为胜利地实现更大更好更全面的跃进，为胜利地完成1960年的国民经济计划，并为将来社会主义的完全胜利和伟大的共产主义事业而努力奋斗！
