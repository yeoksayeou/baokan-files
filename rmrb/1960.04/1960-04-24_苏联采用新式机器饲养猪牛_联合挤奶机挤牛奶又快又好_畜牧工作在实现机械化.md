Brothers Countries Advanced Science and Technology:

    A set of linked machines - a self-propelled chassis pulling a trailer full of crushed soybean meal, traveling across a snowy field. The trailer is not only hooked to the self-propelled chassis, but also connected to the chassis with hoses and steel pipes. A steel pipe with a freely retractable hose stands on one side of the chassis.

    This set of linked machines is heading towards a winter pig farm. The self-propelled chassis stops next to an automatic feeding trough, the tractor driver inserts the hose into the feed filling port of the automatic feeding trough, and then starts the motor. Two minutes later, the three tons of feed on the trailer are loaded into the storage tank of the automatic feeding trough.

    This new type of machinery for transporting and filling dry feed into automatic feeding troughs is widely used in many collective farms in Ukraine, Soviet Union. According to the proposal of the famous mechanical worker Manukovsky, mechanical workers in Ukraine spent the winter last year realizing the mechanization of animal husbandry labor. Specialized work teams in various farms laid hundreds of kilometers of water supply pipelines for breeding farms, installed more than 200,000 automatic drinkers, and tens of thousands of milking machines. In many breeding farms, overhead and ground transportation routes for transporting feed and manure have now been built. These breeding farms raise more than 500,000 cattle.

    Many collective farms will soon realize the comprehensive mechanization of heavy animal husbandry work such as feed preparation and transportation, milking, and shearing.

    Combined Milking Machine

    The Soviet Union has manufactured a universal milking device. This mobile linked device has eight milking stalls. When the dairy cow smells the aroma of feed and walks into the stall, a special automatic device cleans the dairy cow's entire body and washes its udder. The milkmaid only needs to hang up the milking machine. The milk enters the milk filter from the milking machine without contacting the air. After being filtered in the milk filter, it then flows into the cooler, and from the cooler into the milk storage tank or milk tanker.

    This device is equipped with a pump, an electric motor, a cool water heating box, and a milk cooling box, so that the milk can be preliminarily processed directly on the pasture, so that the milk will not turn sour. The combined milking machine can be disassembled and installed in any building.

    Using a combined milking machine, two milkmaids can milk eighty dairy cows in one hour.

### 苏联采用新式机器饲养猪牛  联合挤奶机挤牛奶又快又好  畜牧工作在实现机械化

    苏联采用新式机器饲养猪牛  联合挤奶机挤牛奶又快又好
    畜牧工作在实现机械化
    一组联动机——自行底盘牵引着满载碎豆粕的拖车行驶在积雪的田野里。拖车不仅用挂钩挂在自行底盘上，而且还用软管和钢管同底盘连接在一起。底盘的一侧矗立着一根带有可以自由伸缩的软管的钢管。
    这组联动机正向冬季养猪场开去。自行底盘在自动食槽旁停下来，拖拉机手把软管插入自动食槽的饲料装填口，然后就发动起马达。两分钟以后，拖车上的三吨饲料都被装进自动食槽的贮放罐里。
    这种用于运输和往自动食槽里装填干饲料的新式机械在苏联乌克兰许多集体农庄得到广泛采用。乌克兰的机械工作者根据著名机械工作者马努科夫斯基的倡议，把去冬一冬的时间都用来实现畜牧业劳动机械化。各农庄的专门工作队敷设了上百公里长的供应饲养场用水的水道，安装了二十多万个自动饮水器，上万台挤奶机。在许多饲养场里，现在已经修建了运输饲料和粪便的架空运输道和地上运输道。这些饲养场养牛达五十余万头。
    许多集体农庄不久将实现饲料调制和运输、挤奶、剪毛等繁重的畜牧业工作的综合机械化。
    联合挤奶机
    苏联制成了一种万能挤奶装置。这种活动式联动装置有八个挤奶栏架。当乳牛嗅见饲料香味走进栏架的时候，专门的自动装置便清刷乳牛全身，并洗涤它的乳房。挤奶员只要挂上挤奶器就行了。牛奶从挤奶器中不接触空气就进入漏乳器。在漏乳器中漏清以后，接着便流入冷却器，从冷却器再流入贮奶罐或乳罐车。
    这种装置上装有唧筒、电动机、凉水加热箱和牛奶冷却箱，这样便可以直接在牧场上把牛奶进行初步加工，使牛奶不致发酸。联合挤奶机可以拆开，可以安装在任何房舍里。
    利用联合挤奶机，两个挤奶员一小时能挤八十头乳牛。
