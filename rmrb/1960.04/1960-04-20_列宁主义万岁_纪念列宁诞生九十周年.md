On April 22nd of this year, it will be the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth.

In the year following Lenin's birth, in 1871, the heroic Paris Commune uprising took place. The Paris Commune was a revolutionary event of epoch-making significance, marking the first attempt by the proletariat to overthrow the capitalist system on a global scale. As the Commune was on the verge of defeat due to the counter-revolutionary attack from Versailles, Marx said: "Even if the Commune is crushed, the struggle is only postponed. The principles of the Commune are eternal and indestructible; they will reappear until the working class is liberated." The most fundamental principle of the Commune, according to Marx, was that the working class cannot simply seize the existing state apparatus and use it to achieve its own ends. In other words, the proletariat must use revolutionary means to seize power, smash the bourgeois military-bureaucratic machine, and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat in place of the bourgeois dictatorship. Those familiar with the history of the proletarian struggle know that it is precisely on this fundamental issue that the dividing line between Marxists and opportunists, revisionists, was formed. After the deaths of Marx and Engels, it was Lenin who, to defend the principles of the Commune, waged an uncompromising struggle against opportunists and revisionists.

The cause that the Paris Commune did not achieve was finally won in the Great October Revolution under Lenin's direct leadership after 46 years. The experience of the Soviet Union is a continuation and development of the experience of the Paris Commune. The principles of the Commune, which Marx and Engels repeatedly elucidated and which Lenin enriched with the new experience of the Russian Revolution, were first realized on one-sixth of the earth's land. Marx was completely correct: the principles of the Commune are eternal and indestructible.

The imperialist wolves attempted to strangle the newborn Soviet state, uniting with the counter-revolutionary forces in Russia at the time to carry out armed intervention. However, the brave Russian working class and the peoples of the Soviet Union drove out these foreign invaders, crushed the domestic counter-revolutionary rebellion, and thus consolidated the world's first great socialist republic.

Under the banner of Lenin, under the banner of the October Revolution, the new world revolution, led by the proletarian revolution, began, and a new era in human history commenced.

Through the October Revolution, Lenin's voice quickly spread throughout the world. The Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal May Fourth Movement in 1919, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "occurred under the call of the world revolution at that time, under the call of the Russian Revolution, under the call of Lenin."

Lenin's call was powerful because it was correct. In the historical conditions of the imperialist era, Lenin revealed a series of irrefutable truths about the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Lenin pointed out that the financial capitalist oligarchs of a few imperialist powers, that is, the imperialists, not only exploit the people in their own countries but also oppress and plunder the world, turning most countries into their colonies and semi-colonies. Imperialist wars are a continuation of imperialist policies. The world war was sparked by the insatiable greed of the imperialists, who, to seize the world's markets, sources of raw materials, and investment fields, and to redivide the world, launched it. As long as capital imperialism exists in the world, the root of war still exists, and the possibility of war still exists. The proletariat should guide the people to recognize the root of war and struggle for peace and against imperialism.

Lenin asserted that imperialism is monopolistic, parasitic or decadent, dying capitalism, the final stage of capitalist development, and thus the eve of proletarian revolution. The realization of proletarian liberation cannot be achieved through the path of reformism but only through the path of revolution. The proletarian liberation movement in capitalist countries should form an alliance with the national liberation movements of colonies and semi-colonies. This alliance can shatter the alliance of imperialists with the feudal comprador reactionary forces of colonies and semi-colonies and thus inevitably end the imperialist system in the world.

Based on the law of uneven capitalist economic and political development, Lenin concluded: due to the extremely uneven development of capitalism in various countries, socialism will first achieve victory in one or several countries and cannot achieve victory in all countries simultaneously. Therefore, even if socialism achieves victory in one or several countries, other capitalist countries still exist, which not only causes friction but also leads to the activities of imperialists to overthrow socialist countries. Thus, the struggle will be protracted. The struggle between socialism and capitalism will span an entire historical era. Socialist countries must always be vigilant against the danger of imperialist aggression and exert all efforts to prevent this danger.

The fundamental issue of all revolutions is the issue of state power. Lenin thoroughly and comprehensively discussed the fundamental issue of the proletarian revolution, which is the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The dictatorship of the proletariat, established by smashing the bourgeois state apparatus through revolutionary means, is a special alliance of the proletariat with peasants and all other laborers, a continuation of class struggle under new conditions, a struggle to suppress the resistance of the exploiting classes and to resist foreign aggression, a struggle against the old social forces and their traditions, a struggle that is bloody and non-bloody, forceful and peaceful, military and economic, educational and administrative. Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, without the full mobilization of the laboring people on these fronts by the dictatorship of the proletariat, tenaciously and persistently waging these inevitable struggles, there can be no socialism, no victory of socialism.

Lenin believed that to achieve the proletarian revolution and to achieve and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, the most important thing is for the proletariat to establish a truly revolutionary party that is completely divorced from opportunism, that is, the Communist Party. This party is armed with the theoretical system of Marxist dialectical and historical materialism. The program of this party is to organize the proletariat and all oppressed laboring people to wage class struggle, establish proletarian rule, and ultimately achieve communism through socialism. This party must unite with the masses, respect the historical initiative of the masses; when carrying out the revolution, the party must rely closely on the masses, and when building socialism and communism, the party must also rely closely on the masses.

These truths were repeatedly revealed by Lenin before and after the October Revolution. At that time, the world reactionaries and petty bourgeoisie regarded these truths revealed by Lenin as shocking. However, we see that these truths are steadily victorious in the actual life of the world.

From the October Revolution to the present, over forty years have passed, and the world has undergone new and tremendous changes.

Due to the great achievements of socialist and communist construction, the Soviet Union has transformed a country that was economically and technologically very backward in the era of Tsarist Russia into a country with the world's most advanced technology. The Soviet Union's leap in economy and technology has far outstripped the capitalist countries of Europe and even surpassed the United States in technology.

The great victory of the anti-Fascist war led by the Soviet Union as the main force broke the imperialist chain in Eastern Europe. The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution broke the imperialist chain on the Chinese mainland. A batch of new socialist countries were born. The entire socialist camp led by the Soviet Union has one-quarter of the globe's land, and its population has already accounted for more than one-third of the world's total population. Now, the socialist camp has formed an independent world economic system that stands in opposition to the capitalist world economic system. The total industrial output of socialist countries now accounts for nearly 40% of the world's total industrial output, and it will not be long before it surpasses the total industrial output of capitalist countries.

The imperialist colonial system has collapsed and is continuing to disintegrate. The struggle is certainly tortuous, but overall, the storm of national liberation is sweeping Asia, Africa, and Latin America more and more broadly. The development of things turns to its opposite: the imperialists are becoming weaker and weaker, while the peoples there are becoming stronger and stronger.

The relatively stable situation of capitalism that existed after the First World War has long ended. After the Second World War, due to the formation of the socialist world economic system, the capitalist world market has greatly shrunk compared to the past. The contradiction between the productive forces and production relations in capitalist society has become more acute. Capitalist economic crises are no longer occurring every ten years but almost every three or four years. Recently, some representatives of the American bourgeoisie have acknowledged that the United States has experienced three "economic recessions" in ten years, and after just recovering from the "economic recession" of 1957-1958, they now feel that a new "economic recession" is about to come. The shortening of the cycle of capitalist economic crises is a new phenomenon, further indicating that the world capitalist system is increasingly approaching its inevitable doom.

The development of capitalist countries has become more imbalanced than before. The imperialist sphere is becoming narrower and narrower, and the narrow path leads to confrontation. American imperialism is constantly seizing the original markets and spheres of influence from Britain, France, and other imperialist powers. The imperialist countries led by the United States have been expanding military forces for more than a decade, and the militarism of West Germany and Japan, which were defeated in the Second World War, has risen again with the help of their former enemy, American imperialism. These two imperialist powers are now talking about their "traditional friendship" and engaging in so-called "the Bonn-Tokyo axis starting from Washington" activities. West German imperialism has been shamelessly seeking military bases abroad. This has intensified the fierce conflicts within imperialism and increased the threat to the socialist camp and all peace-loving countries. The current situation is very similar to the situation after the First World War when American and British imperialists helped German militarism rise again, and the result will be the same: they will "lift the stone to hit their own feet." The creation of world tension by American imperialism after the Second World War does not indicate its strength but its weakness, and it precisely reflects the unprecedented instability of the capitalist system.

American imperialism, to realize its ambition of dominating the world, not only meticulously carries out various sabotage and subversion activities against socialist countries but also, under the pretext of opposing the "communist threat," assumes the role of the world's gendarme to suppress revolutions in various countries, setting up military bases all over the world, seizing the intermediate zone, and engaging in military provocations. Like a rat crossing the street, American imperialism is everywhere beaten and bloodied, everywhere arousing a new surge of people's revolutionary struggles. Now, even they themselves feel that, compared to the thriving scene of the socialist world led by the Soviet Union, "the influence of the United States as a great power is declining." In their eyes, "they only see a period of decline like ancient Rome."

The changes in the world over the past forty years are precisely: imperialism is rotting day by day, while socialism is improving day by day. We are now facing a great new era, and the main feature of this new era is that the strength of socialism has surpassed the strength of imperialism, and the awakening strength of the peoples of the world has surpassed the strength of reaction.

The current world situation has obviously undergone tremendous changes compared to the time when Lenin was alive. However, all these changes do not prove that Leninism is outdated but, on the contrary, increasingly confirm the truths revealed by Lenin and increasingly confirm the entire doctrine proposed by Lenin in the struggle to defend revolutionary Marxism and develop Marxism.

Lenin, under the historical conditions of the imperialist and proletarian revolutionary era, advanced Marxism to a new stage and pointed out a true path for all oppressed classes and oppressed peoples to free themselves from the slavery of capital imperialism and poverty.

These forty years have been forty years of victory for Leninism in the world, forty years of Leninism increasingly penetrating the hearts of the people in the world. Leninism has not only achieved and will continue to achieve great victories in countries that have already established the socialist system but also continuously achieves new victories in the struggles of all oppressed peoples.

The victory of Leninism has been cheered by the people of the world, but it has also inevitably aroused the hatred of imperialists and all reactionaries. Imperialists, to weaken the influence of Leninism and to dull the revolutionary will of the people, have launched the most savage and despicable attacks and slanders against Leninism and have bought and utilized waverers and traitors within the workers' movement to distort and castrate Lenin's teachings. At the end of the 19th century, when Marxism defeated various anti-Marxist currents and widely spread in the workers' movement, gaining a dominant position, the revisionists led by Bernstein, in response to the needs of the bourgeoisie, proposed to revise Marx's teachings. Now, when Leninism leads the world proletariat, all oppressed classes, and oppressed nations to march against imperialism and various reactionaries and achieve great victories, the modern revisionists led by Tito, in response to the needs of imperialists, propose to revise the teachings of Lenin (that is, modern Marxism). As the declaration of the conference of the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries held in Moscow in November 1957 said: "The existence of bourgeois influence is the domestic root of revisionism. Submission to imperialist pressure is the foreign root of revisionism." The old revisionism once attempted to prove that Marxism was outdated, while modern revisionism attempts to prove that Leninism is outdated. The Moscow conference declaration said: "Modern revisionism attempts to slander the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, saying that it is 'outdated,' as if it has lost its significance for social development at present. Revisionists try to corrupt the revolutionary soul of Marxism, undermine the confidence of the working class and laboring people in socialism." This statement is very correct, and the situation is exactly like this.

Has the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism become "outdated" by now? Does the entire complete doctrine of Lenin about imperialism, about proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, about war and peace, about building socialism and communism, still retain its abundant vitality? If it is still effective and has abundant vitality, is it a part of it or the whole of it? We usually say that Leninism is Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, Marxism in the era of the victory of socialism and communism. Is this statement still correct? Can we say that Lenin's original conclusions and our usual concept of Leninism have become ineffective and incorrect, and therefore we should go back to accept the conclusions of revisionism and opportunism, which were long ago refuted by Lenin and have long since failed in actual life? These are the questions that must be answered now. Marxist-Leninists must thoroughly expose the fallacies of imperialists and modern revisionists on these issues, eliminate their influence among the masses, and make those who have been temporarily deceived by them wake up, and further arouse the revolutionary will of the people.

The imperialists of the United States, the open representatives of the bourgeoisie of many countries, the modern revisionists led by the Tito group, and the right-wing of the Social Democratic Party, in order to lead the peoples of the world astray, are striving to give a completely distorted depiction of the modern world situation, attempting to use this to prove their so-called "Marxism is outdated," "Leninism is also outdated" and the like.

Tito's speech at the end of last year repeatedly mentioned the so-called "new era" of modern revisionists. Tito said: "Today, the world has entered a new era where countries can relax and calmly devote themselves to their domestic construction tasks." He also said, "We have entered an era where new problems have appeared on the agenda, which are not problems of war and peace, but problems of cooperation, economy, and other aspects. In terms of economic cooperation, there is also the problem of economic competition." This traitor completely ignores the issue of class contradictions and class struggle in the world and attempts to erase the interpretation of Marxist-Leninists that our era is the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, the era of the victory of socialism and communism.

However, what is the real situation in the world? Have the exploited and oppressed peoples in imperialist countries "relaxed"? Have the peoples in all colonies and semi-colonies still under imperialist oppression "relaxed"?

In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, has the armed intervention led by American imperialists "calmed down"? When American imperialists are still occupying our Taiwan, has the Taiwan Strait "calmed down"? When the peoples of Algeria and many regions in Africa are suffering from armed suppression by French, British, and other imperialists, has the African continent "calmed down"? When American imperialism is using bombing, assassination, and subversion activities to sabotage the Cuban people's revolution, has Latin America "calmed down"?

What is meant by "devoting to their domestic construction tasks"? Everyone knows that there are various different countries in the world now, and the main ones are two types of countries with fundamentally different social systems: one belongs to the socialist world system, and the other belongs to the capitalist world system. What Tito is talking about is the "domestic construction" of imperialism to oppress its own people, oppress the world, and expand military forces? Or is it the "domestic construction" of socialism to increase the happiness of the people and seek lasting world peace?

Has the issue of war and peace become a non-issue? Is imperialism no longer in existence, and the system of exploitation no longer in existence, so there is no longer the issue of war? Or is it to let imperialism and the system of exploitation exist forever, and there will be no issue of war? In fact, since the Second World War, wars have been continuous. Are the wars of imperialism to suppress national liberation movements, the wars of imperialist armed intervention in various countries' revolutions, not wars? Although these wars have not yet become world wars, are these local wars not wars? Although these wars are not conducted with nuclear weapons, are wars conducted with so-called conventional weapons not wars? Is it not the warlike policy of American imperialism to use nearly 60% of its fiscal budget in 1960 for military expansion? Is the revival of militarism in West Germany and Japan not a threat to bring new great war dangers to humanity?

What kind of "cooperation" is it? Cooperation between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to protect capitalism? Cooperation between the peoples of colonies and semi-colonies and imperialism to protect colonialism? Cooperation between socialist countries and capitalist countries to protect the imperialist system to oppress their own people and suppress national liberation wars?

In short, according to the modern revisionists' so-called "era," it is a challenge to Leninism on the above and other issues. Their purpose is to erase the contradictions between the peoples of imperialist countries and the monopolistic bourgeoisie, the contradictions between the peoples of colonies and semi-colonies and imperialist invaders, the contradictions between the socialist system and the imperialist system, the contradictions between the peace-loving peoples of the world and the imperialist warlike group.

Regarding the distinction of "eras," there are various different sayings. Generally speaking, one is to boast and fabricate some vague, unpredictable phrases to cover up the essence of the era, which is a trick often used by imperialists, the bourgeoisie, and revisionists in the workers' movement. One is to conduct a specific analysis of the concrete situation of the overall class contradictions and class struggle, propose strict scientific regulations, and thoroughly expose the essence of the era, which is the work done by every serious Marxist.

Lenin proposed the distinction of eras in this way: "...Here we are talking about great eras in history, whether past or future, each era has individual, partial, sometimes advancing and sometimes retreating movements, and various tendencies that deviate from the general movement and the general speed of the movement. We cannot know how fast and how smoothly the development of certain historical movements of this era will be. However, we can know, and indeed know, which class is the center of this or that era, determining the main content of the era, the main direction of the era's development, the main characteristics of the era's historical background, etc. Only on this basis, that is, first of all, by estimating the basic characteristics of distinguishing different 'eras' (rather than individual episodes in the history of individual countries), we can correctly formulate our strategy..." Lenin here said that the so-called era is the issue of which class becomes the center of the era, the issue of which class determines the main content of the era, determines the main direction of the era's development.

Lenin, who was faithful to Marxist dialectics, never left the position of analyzing class relations. He believed that "Marxism judges 'interests' based on the class contradictions and class struggles manifested in the daily lives of millions of facts." He believed that "Marx's method first considers the objective content of historical processes in specific times and specific environments, in order to first understand, in this specific environment, which class's movement is the main driving force for social progress." Lenin always wanted us to analyze specific historical development processes based on class analysis, rather than talking vaguely about "general society," "general progress." We Marxists cannot formulate proletarian policies based on certain immediate events or minor political changes, but should formulate proletarian policies based on the overall class contradictions and class struggles of the entire historical era. This is the basic theoretical position of Marxists. It is precisely by firmly occupying this position that Lenin, in the new period of class changes, in the new historical period, drew the conclusion that the hope of humanity lies entirely in the victory of the proletariat, and the proletariat must be prepared to win in this great revolutionary struggle, thereby establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. After the October Revolution, in 1918, at the Seventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Lenin said: "We should start from the development of commodity production, the transition to capitalism, and the development of capitalism into imperialism as the general basis. In this way, we theoretically occupy and consolidate the position, and no one who has not betrayed socialism will drive us out of this position. At the same time, we can also draw a similarly inevitable conclusion from here: the era of socialist revolution has begun." This is Lenin's conclusion, and it is still a conclusion that all Marxists need to ponder today.

The revolutionary Marxists' proposition that our era is the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, the era of the victory of socialism and communism, is irrefutable because this proposition correctly grasps the basic characteristics of this great era. The proposition that Leninism is the continuation and development of revolutionary Marxism in such a great era, the proposition that Leninism is the theory and policy of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, is also irrefutable because it is precisely Leninism that exposes the contradictions between the working class and monopoly capital in this great era, the contradictions between imperialist countries, the contradictions between the peoples of colonies and semi-colonies and imperialism, the contradictions between the socialist countries that have achieved victory and imperialist countries. Therefore, Leninism has also become our banner of victory. However, contrary to this series of propositions of revolutionary Marxism, in the so-called "new era" of the Titos, in fact, imperialism has disappeared, proletarian revolution has disappeared, the theory and policy of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat have naturally disappeared. In short, in their eyes, there is no fundamental focus of class contradictions and class struggles in our era, no fundamental issues of Leninism, no Leninism.

Modern revisionists insist that in their so-called "new era," due to the progress of science and technology, the "old concepts" proposed by Marx and Lenin are no longer applicable. Tito put forward such a view: "We are not dogmatists because Marx and Lenin did not prophesy the moon rocket, the atomic bomb, and great technological progress." Very well, they are not dogmatists. Who asked them to be dogmatists? However, one can be against dogmatism for Marxism-Leninism, and one can also be against Marxism-Leninism in the name of anti-dogmatism. The Titos belong to the latter category. On the issue of what influence the progress of science and technology has on social development, there are people who, because they cannot view it from the perspective of historical materialism, have incorrect views. This is understandable, but modern revisionists deliberately create confusion on this issue and use the progress of science and technology to attempt to overthrow Marxism-Leninism.

In recent years, the Soviet Union has achieved remarkable results in science and technology, standing at the forefront of the world. These achievements of the Soviet Union are the products of the great October Revolution. These outstanding achievements mark a new era of human conquest of nature and have played a very important role in defending world peace. However, in the new conditions of modern technological development, is it, as Tito said, that the ideological system of Marxism-Leninism has been shaken by the "moon rocket, atomic bomb, and great technological progress" that Marx and Lenin "did not prophesy"? Can we say that the basic concepts of Marxism-Leninism's worldview, historical view, moral view, etc., have thus become so-called outdated "dogmas," and the laws of class struggle no longer exist?

Marx and Lenin did not live to see the specific conditions of technological progress in the modern world. However, the development of natural science and technology, for the capitalist system, means what? They believe that this only portends a new social revolution, not the disappearance of social revolution.

We know that Marx and Lenin were both delighted by the new discoveries and progress in the conquest of nature by natural science and technology. Engels said in his speech at Marx's grave: "Science, in Marx's view, is a revolutionary force that plays a driving role in history. Although every new discovery in theoretical science, even if its practical application is not yet foreseeable, makes him extremely happy, when there is a discovery that will immediately have a revolutionary impact on industry and general historical development, his joy is completely different." After saying this, Engels went on to say, "After all, Marx is first and foremost a revolutionary." This is very correct! Marx always viewed everything that conquers nature from the perspective of a proletarian revolutionary, not from the perspective of a proletarian revolutionary disappearance theorist. Wilhelm Liebknecht said in his "Remembrance of Marx": "Marx ridiculed the victorious reactionary forces in Europe, who imagined that the revolution had been suffocated, and did not think that natural science was preparing a new revolution. The steam king turned the world upside down in the last century; now its reign is coming to an end; another force, incomparably greater, the spark of electric power, will take its place. ... The consequences of this are incalculable. After the economic revolution, there must be a political revolution, because the latter is only the manifestation of the former. When Marx talked about the progress of science and mechanics, his worldview, especially what is now called historical materialism, was so clear that my previous doubts, like the snow in spring sunshine, melted away."

Marx was thus inspired by the progress of science and technology to feel the breath of revolution. He believed that the new progress of science and technology would bring about a social revolution to overthrow the capitalist system. In Marx's view, the progress of natural science and technology strengthens the entire worldview of Marxism, strengthens the position of historical materialism, and is absolutely not shaking it. The progress of natural science and technology strengthens the position of the proletarian revolution and the oppressed nations to fight against imperialism, and is absolutely not weakening it.

Like Marx, Lenin also linked the progress of technology with the issue of the revolution of the social system. Lenin thus believed: "The steam age is the age of the bourgeoisie, the electric age is the age of socialism."

Please compare the revolutionary spirit of Marx and Lenin with the shameful attitude of betraying the revolution of modern revisionists! In a class society, in the era of imperialism, Marxist-Leninists can only view the development and use of technology from the perspective of class analysis. Because the socialist system is progressive and represents the interests of the people, socialist countries should use new technologies such as atomic energy and rockets to serve domestic peaceful construction and conquer nature. The more new technologies socialist countries master and the faster they develop, the more they will achieve the goal of rapidly developing productive forces to meet the needs of the people, and at the same time, the more they will strengthen the power to stop imperialist wars and increase the possibility of defending world peace. Therefore, for the welfare of the people of socialist countries and for the peaceful interests of the people of the world, each socialist country should, as far as possible, increasingly master these new technologies for the benefit of the people. Now, socialist Soviet Union has significantly taken the lead in the development of new technologies. People know that the rocket that hit the moon was launched by the Soviet Union, not by the most developed capitalist country, the United States. This shows: only in socialist countries can there be unlimited prospects for the large-scale development of new technologies.

On the contrary, because the imperialist system is a reactionary, anti-people system, imperialist countries use these new technologies for the military purposes of invading foreign countries and threatening their own people, for the purpose of manufacturing weapons of mass destruction. For imperialist countries, the emergence of these new technologies only pushes the contradiction between the development of productive forces and capitalist production relations to a new stage, and what it brings is not the eternal existence of capitalism but only further arouses the revolution of their own people, only the destruction of this evil old system of cannibalism.

American imperialists and their accomplices use weapons such as atomic bombs to threaten the world with war and blackmail. They say that whoever does not submit to the rule of American imperialism will be destroyed. The Tito group also echoes, helping American imperialism to spread the terror of atomic war among the people. The blackmail of American imperialism and the echo of the Tito group can only temporarily confuse those who do not know the truth, but they cannot frighten the awakened people; even those who temporarily do not know the truth will gradually understand the truth with the help of advanced elements.

Marxist-Leninists have always believed that in world history, what determines the fate of humanity is not technology but people, the people. Before and during the Chinese War of Resistance against Japan, some people once spread the so-called "weapon-only theory," saying that Japanese weapons were new and technology was advanced, while Chinese weapons were old and technology was backward, so their conclusion was the so-called "China must perish." Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Protracted War" published at that time refuted this nonsense. He made the following analysis: the Japanese imperialist war of aggression against China must fail because it is reactionary and unjust, and it is isolated; while the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan must win because it is progressive and just, and it is supported by many. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: the deepest source of the power of war lies in the people, and the people's army organized by the awakened and united people will be invincible in the world. This is the point of Marxism-Leninism. The result was: the point of Marxism-Leninism won, while those who advocated the so-called "theory of national extinction" finally failed. After the Second World War, in the Korean War, the Korean and Chinese peoples defeated the American aggressors who were far superior in weaponry, once again proving this point of Marxism-Leninism.

Awakened people will always find new ways to resist the armed superiority of reactionaries and thus achieve their own victory. The past is like this, and the present and future will be the same. Because the socialist Soviet Union has already taken the lead in military technology, American imperialists have lost their monopoly on atomic and nuclear weapons, and because of the awakening of the people of the world, including the people of the United States, there is now the possibility of establishing a treaty to prohibit atomic and nuclear weapons in the world. We strive to be able to establish such a treaty. Unlike the warlike imperialists, the socialist countries and the peace-loving peoples of the world are all actively and resolutely advocating the prohibition and destruction of atomic and nuclear weapons. We always fight against imperialist wars, always fight for the prohibition of atomic and nuclear weapons, always fight for the defense of world peace. The more widespread and in-depth this struggle is, the more thoroughly the brutal and savage nature of American imperialists and other imperialists is exposed, the more we can isolate American imperialists and other imperialists in the eyes of the world's people, the more we can restrain the hands and feet of American imperialists and other imperialists, the more it is beneficial to the cause of world peace. On the contrary, if we lose vigilance against the danger of imperialist war, do not strive to mobilize the peoples of all countries to oppose imperialism, and bind the hands and feet of the people, then imperialism can prepare for war as it pleases, and the result will inevitably increase the danger of imperialist war. When war breaks out, the people may not be able to take the correct attitude towards war due to lack of preparation or insufficient preparation, and thus be unable to effectively stop the war. Of course, whether imperialists start a war or not is not decided by us, we are not the chief of staff of imperialists after all. As long as the peoples of all countries raise their awareness and are fully prepared, under the condition that the socialist camp has already mastered modern weapons, it can be affirmed that if American imperialists or other imperialists refuse to reach an agreement to prohibit atomic and nuclear weapons and dare to "defy the world" to use atomic and nuclear weapons to wage war, the result will only be that these beasts surrounded by the people of the world will be quickly destroyed, and it will not be the destruction of humanity. Imperialist wars of evil will always be opposed by us because imperialist wars will bring great sacrifices to the peoples of all countries (including the peoples of the United States and other imperialist countries). However, if imperialists force this sacrifice on the peoples of all countries, we believe, as the experience of the Russian Revolution and the Chinese Revolution shows, this sacrifice will be rewarded. The victorious people will, on the ruins of the death of imperialism, create a civilization thousands of times higher than the capitalist system at an extremely rapid pace, creating their own truly beautiful future.

The conclusion can only be: from any perspective, atomic energy, rockets, and other new technologies have not changed the basic characteristics of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution pointed out by Lenin. Capital imperialism will not collapse by itself; it will be overthrown by the proletarian revolution of its own country and the national revolution of colonies and semi-colonies. The progress of contemporary technology cannot save the doomed fate of capital imperialism but only rings a new death knell for the capitalist imperialist system.

Modern revisionists, starting from their absurd judgments on the modern world situation, starting from their absurd judgment that the class analysis and class struggle theory of Marxism-Leninism is outdated, attempt to fundamentally overturn the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism on a series of issues such as violence, war, and peaceful coexistence.

In addition, there are some people who are not revisionists, who are well-intentioned and sincerely wish to be Marxists, but when faced with certain new phenomena in history, they are confused and have some incorrect ideas. For example, some of them say that the failure of American imperialism's atomic blackmail policy is the end of violence. While we thoroughly refute the fallacies of modern revisionists, we should also help these well-intentioned people correct their incorrect ideas.

What is violence? Regarding this issue, Lenin said a lot in his book "The State and Revolution." The emergence and existence of the state itself is a kind of violence. Lenin introduced Engels' explanation: "...The power that constitutes this power is not only armed forces but also material appendages, such as prisons and other coercive agencies..." Lenin told us that we must distinguish between the two different types of states: the state of bourgeois dictatorship and the state of proletarian dictatorship, and distinguish between the two different types of violence: counter-revolutionary violence and revolutionary violence. There is counter-revolutionary violence, and there must be revolutionary violence to oppose it. Without revolutionary violence, it is impossible to eliminate counter-revolutionary violence. The state where the exploiting class is in power is a special force for the suppression of the exploited class, a special force for the oppression of the exploited class by the exploiting class. Before and after imperialists had atomic bombs or rocket weapons, imperialist states have always been special forces for the suppression of the proletariat in their own countries and the peoples of colonies and semi-colonies, and have always been such violent agencies; even if imperialists are forced not to use these new weapons, imperialist states, as long as they have not been overthrown and replaced by the people's states, by the states of proletarian dictatorship in their own countries, they are still imperialist violent agencies.

Since the beginning of history, there has never been such a large-scale, extremely brutal violence as the one formed by the capital imperialists. Over the past decade, American imperialists have been shamelessly using torture methods a hundred times more barbaric than before, trampling on the outstanding sons of the working class in their own country, trampling on blacks, trampling on all progressive people, and have been shamelessly declaring to put the whole world under their violent rule. They continue to expand their violence, and other imperialists are also engaged in a competition to strengthen violence.

The military expansion of the imperialist countries led by the United States is taking place under the unprecedented heavy crisis of capitalism. The more imperialism crazily develops its military power to the highest point, the more it means that they themselves are approaching doom. Now, even some representatives of American imperialism sense the inevitability of the doom of the capitalist system. However, is it because imperialism is approaching doom that imperialism will end its own violence by itself, and the rulers of imperialist countries will voluntarily abandon the violence they have established?

Can we say that imperialists, compared to past periods, are no longer lovers of violence, or that their love for violence has decreased?

Regarding such questions, Lenin has given many answers. In "Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism," he pointed out: "...In politics, imperialism always seeks to use violence and carry out reaction." After the October Revolution, in "Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky," he specifically narrated history, comparing the differences between pre-monopoly capitalism and monopoly capitalism, that is, imperialism. He said: "Pre-monopoly capitalism (its heyday was precisely in the 1870s), due to its fundamental economic characteristics (which are particularly typical in England and the United States), is relatively speaking, the most peaceful and the most free. However, imperialism, that is, monopoly capitalism that fully formed in the 20th century, due to its fundamental economic characteristics, is the least peaceful and the least free, developing militarism everywhere." Of course, Lenin's words were spoken in the early days of the October Revolution, when the proletarian state was just born, its economic power was still weak, and after more than forty years, as we have described before, the Soviet state itself and the whole world have greatly changed their appearance. So, is it because the strength of the Soviet Union is great, the strength of socialism is great, and the strength of peace is great that the nature of imperialism has changed, and thus Lenin's above-mentioned conclusions are outdated? Or is it that the nature of imperialism has not changed, but it will no longer use violence? Is this view in line with the real situation?

In the struggle between the socialist world system and the capitalist world system, the socialist system has obviously taken the lead. This great historical fact has weakened the position of violence that imperialism has in the world. However, will this fact make imperialists no longer oppress their own people, no longer expand outward, and engage in aggressive activities? Will it make the warlike group of imperialists "lay down their butcher knives" and "sell their swords to buy cattle" from now on? Will it make the military-industrial complex of imperialist countries change to peaceful industries from now on?

All these questions are placed before every serious Marxist-Leninist today and must be deeply pondered. Obviously, whether these questions are correctly understood and correctly handled is closely related to the success or failure of the proletarian cause and the fate of all humanity.

War is the most acute form of violence. One is domestic war, and one is foreign war. Violence is not always expressed in the most acute form of war. In capitalist countries, the war of the bourgeoisie is the continuation of the bourgeoisie's peacetime policy, and the peace of the bourgeoisie is the continuation of the bourgeoisie's wartime policy. The bourgeoisie always alternately adopts the two forms of war and peace to carry out the rule over the people and the struggle against foreign countries. In the so-called peacetime, imperialists rely on armed forces to use arrest, imprisonment, hard labor, massacre, and other forms of violence to deal with the oppressed classes and oppressed nations, while preparing to use the most acute form of violence, war, to suppress domestic people's revolutions, to carry out plunder abroad, to suppress foreign competitors, and to extinguish foreign revolutions; or domestic peace and foreign war coexist.

In the early days of the October Revolution, various imperialists adopted the form of war violence against the Soviet Union, which was the continuation of the policies of various imperialists; in the Second World War, German imperialists used large-scale war violence to attack the Soviet Union, which was the continuation of German imperialist policy. However, on the other hand, imperialists also established diplomatic relations of peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union in various different periods, which of course was also the continuation of imperialist policy in another form under certain conditions.

Indeed, new issues related to peaceful coexistence have emerged. Imperialists, standing in front of the powerful Soviet Union, standing in front of the powerful socialist camp, will inevitably consider that if they attack the Soviet Union, attack socialist countries, will they, like Hitler, accelerate their own doom, will they bring the most serious consequences to the capitalist system itself?

"Peaceful coexistence" is a new concept that emerged in the world after the October Revolution, when socialist countries appeared for the first time. It is a new concept formed in the situation that Lenin foresaw before the October Revolution, that is, "socialism cannot achieve victory in all countries at the same time, it will first achieve victory in one or several countries, while the remaining countries will still be capitalist or pre-capitalist countries for some time." It is a new concept proposed by Lenin after the great Soviet people defeated the armed intervention of imperialism. As mentioned above, initially, imperialists did not want to coexist peacefully with the Soviet Union. Only after the war of intervention against the Soviet Union failed, only after several years of actual confrontation, only after the Soviet state had already taken root, only after the Soviet state and imperialist countries had formed a certain balance of power, did the imperialists have to coexist with the Soviet Union. In 1920, Lenin said, "We have already fought for the conditions to coexist peacefully with the capitalist powers, and these powers now have to establish trade relations with us." It can be seen that the first socialist country in the world can coexist peacefully with imperialism for a certain period of time, completely through struggle. Before the Second World War, from 1920 to 1940, before Germany attacked the Soviet Union, was the period of peaceful coexistence between imperialism and the Soviet Union. During these twenty years, the Soviet Union always adhered to the faith of peaceful coexistence. However, in 1941, Hitler no longer wanted to coexist peacefully with the Soviet Union, and the German imperialists treacherously launched a barbaric attack on the Soviet Union. Due to the victory of the anti-Fascist war led by the great Soviet Union as the main force, the situation of peaceful coexistence between socialist countries and capitalist countries re-emerged in the world. However, imperialists have not given up. American imperialism has established a network of military bases and missile bases around the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp. American imperialism is still occupying our Taiwan and is constantly provoking us militarily in the Taiwan Strait. American imperialism armed intervention in Korea, once fought a large-scale war with the Korean people and the Chinese people on Korean soil, and the result was due to the failure of American imperialism that the armistice agreement was signed, but until now, it is still interfering with the unification of the Korean people. American imperialism provided weapons to the French imperialist occupying army against the Vietnamese people's war, and until now, it is still interfering with the unification of the Vietnamese people. American imperialism once instigated counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary and until now, it is still constantly trying to use various methods to carry out subversive activities in Eastern European socialist countries and other socialist countries. The facts are still as Lenin said in February 1920 to an American journalist, on the issue of peace, "there are no obstacles on our side. It is the imperialism of American (and other countries') capitalists that is the obstacle."

Modern revisionists, starting from their absurd judgments on the modern world situation, starting from their absurd judgment that the class analysis and class struggle theory of Marxism-Leninism is outdated, attempt to fundamentally overturn the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism on a series of issues such as violence, war, and peaceful coexistence.

In addition, there are some people who are not revisionists, who are well-intentioned and sincerely wish to be Marxists, but when faced with certain new phenomena in history, they are confused and have some incorrect ideas. For example, some of them say that the failure of American imperialism's atomic blackmail policy is the end of violence. While we thoroughly refute the fallacies of modern revisionists, we should also help these well-intentioned people correct their incorrect ideas.

What is violence? Regarding this issue, Lenin said a lot in his book "The State and Revolution." The emergence and existence of the state itself is a kind of violence. Lenin introduced Engels' explanation: "...The power that constitutes this power is not only armed forces but also material appendages, such as prisons and other coercive agencies..." Lenin told us that we must distinguish between the two different types of states: the state of bourgeois dictatorship and the state of proletarian dictatorship, and distinguish between the two different types of violence: counter-revolutionary violence and revolutionary violence. There is counter-revolutionary violence, and there must be revolutionary violence to oppose it. Without revolutionary violence, it is impossible to eliminate counter-revolutionary violence. The state where the exploiting class is in power is a special force for the suppression of the exploited class, a special force for the oppression of the exploited class by the exploiting class. Before and after imperialists had atomic bombs or rocket weapons, imperialist states have always been special forces for the suppression of the proletariat in their own countries and the peoples of colonies and semi-colonies, and have always been such violent agencies; even if imperialists are forced not to use these new weapons, imperialist states, as long as they have not been overthrown and replaced by the people's states, by the states of proletarian dictatorship in their own countries, they are still imperialist violent agencies.

Since the beginning of history, there has never been such a large-scale, extremely brutal violence as the one formed by the capital imperialists. Over the past decade, American imperialists have been shamelessly using torture methods a hundred times more barbaric than before, trampling on the outstanding sons of the working class in their own country, trampling on blacks, trampling on all progressive people, and have been shamelessly declaring to put the whole world under their violent rule. They continue to expand their violence, and other imperialists are also engaged in a competition to strengthen violence.

The military expansion of the imperialist countries led by the United States is taking place under the unprecedented heavy crisis of capitalism. The more imperialism crazily develops its military power to the highest point, the more it means that they themselves are approaching doom. Now, even some representatives of American imperialism sense the inevitability of the doom of the capitalist system. However, is it because imperialism is approaching doom that imperialism will end its own violence by itself, and the rulers of imperialist countries will voluntarily abandon the violence they have established?

Title: The Socialist Countries' Foreign Policy Must Be a Policy of Peace
Author:
Date: 1957-12-09
Page: 1

The foreign policy of socialist countries can only be a policy of peace. The socialist system determines that we do not need war and will never initiate war. We will not, should not, and cannot occupy an inch of land from neighboring countries. Since its establishment, the People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy. Our country, along with India and Burma, jointly advocated the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In the 1955 Bandung Conference, we also jointly passed the Ten Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with Asian and African countries. Over the past few years, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government have consistently supported the activities of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union led by Comrade Khrushchev and the Soviet government for peace. We believe that the activities of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government for peace have further proven the firmness of the peaceful foreign policy of socialist countries to the peoples of all countries. It has also further proven the necessity for the peoples of all countries to stop imperialism from launching a new world war and to strive for lasting world peace.

The 1957 Moscow Declaration states: "The forces maintaining peace in the contemporary world are these powerful forces: the indestructible socialist camp led by the Soviet Union; the peace-loving countries of Asia and Africa that stand on the anti-imperialist side and together with the socialist countries form a vast peaceful region; the international proletariat, primarily its vanguard—the Communist parties; the liberation movements of the colonies and semi-colonies; the mass movements for peace of the peoples of all countries. Those who resolutely resist the plotting of a new war also include the peoples of the European countries that have declared neutrality, the peoples of Latin America, and the masses of the imperialist countries. The unity of these powerful forces can prevent the outbreak of war." As long as these powerful forces continue to develop, the situation of peaceful coexistence can continue to be maintained, and it is even possible to formally reach some agreement on peaceful coexistence, and even to reach an agreement to ban atomic and nuclear weapons. This is completely in line with the wishes of the peoples of all countries and is a good thing. However, even in such a situation, as long as the imperialist system still exists, war, as the most acute form of violence, has not ended in the world. Things are not like what the Yugoslav revisionists say, that the definition of "war is the continuation of policy by other means," which Lenin repeatedly explained and insisted on in his struggle against opportunism, has become outdated.

We believe that Lenin's thoughts are completely correct: war is the inevitable product of the exploitative system, and the root cause of modern war is the imperialist system. Before the imperialist system and the exploiting classes die out, wars of one kind or another will inevitably appear. It could be wars between imperialists for the redivision of the world, it could be wars of aggression and counter-aggression between imperialists and oppressed nations, it could be civil wars of revolution and counter-revolution within imperialist countries between the exploited classes and the exploiting classes, and of course, it could also be wars of defense by socialist countries when imperialism attacks socialist countries. All these wars are the continuation of the policy of a certain class. Marxist-Leninists must not fall into the swamp of bourgeois pacifism and can only adopt the method of concrete class analysis to understand these problems and draw conclusions for the proletariat's policy. As Lenin said in "The Military Program of the Proletarian Revolution": "It is completely wrong in theory to forget that any war is only the continuation of policy by other means."

Imperialism, in order to achieve its goals of plunder and oppression, always has two hands: one is war, and the other is "peace." Therefore, the proletariat and the peoples of all countries must also have two hands to deal with imperialism: one is to expose the imperialist peace deception and strive for true world peace, and the other is to prepare for a just war to end the imperialist unjust war when imperialism launches a war.

In summary, for the interests of the peoples of all countries, on the issues of violence, war, and peaceful coexistence, we must smash the fallacies of modern revisionism and adhere to the views of Marxism-Leninism.

The Yugoslav revisionists deny the class nature inherent in violence and thus erase the fundamental difference between revolutionary violence and counter-revolutionary violence; they deny the class nature inherent in war and thus erase the fundamental difference between just wars and unjust wars; they deny that imperialist war is the continuation of imperialist policy, deny the danger of imperialism launching a new war, and deny that only after the exploiting classes are eliminated can wars be eliminated. They shamelessly call the head of American imperialism, Eisenhower, the "founder of eliminating the cold war and establishing lasting peace and peaceful competition between different political systems." They deny that under the conditions of peaceful coexistence, complex and fierce struggles still exist in all aspects, including politics, economics, and ideology, etc. — The views of the Yugoslav revisionists are all aimed at poisoning the thoughts of the proletariat and the peoples of all countries and are beneficial to the war policy of imperialism.

Modern revisionists equate the peaceful foreign policy of socialist countries with the internal policy of the proletariat in capitalist countries, and thus believe that peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems means that capitalism can peacefully transition into socialism, that the proletariat in capitalist countries can abandon class struggle under bourgeois rule, and can cooperate peacefully with the bourgeoisie and imperialists, that the proletariat and all exploited classes should forget that they are living in a class society, etc. — These views are all fundamentally opposed to Marxism-Leninism. Their purpose is to protect the rule of imperialism and attempt to make the proletariat and all laboring masses permanently accept the slavery of capitalism.

Peaceful coexistence between countries and the revolutions of the peoples of all countries are two different things, not one thing; they are two concepts, not one concept; they are two types of problems, not one type of problem.

Peaceful coexistence refers to the problem of mutual relations between countries; revolution refers to the problem of the oppressed peoples of a country overthrowing the oppressing classes, and for colonial and semi-colonial countries, it is first of all the problem of overthrowing foreign oppressors, i.e., imperialists. Before the October Revolution, there was no problem of peaceful coexistence between socialist countries and capitalist countries in the world because there were no socialist countries at that time; however, there were problems of proletarian revolution and national revolution in the world because the peoples of all countries had already put this type of revolution or that type of revolution on the agenda of deciding their own country's fate according to their own specific situations.

We are Marxist-Leninists. We have always believed that revolution is the business of each nation. We have always believed that the working class can only liberate itself, and the liberation of the people of a country depends on the awakening of the people within the country and the maturity of revolutionary conditions within the country. Revolution cannot be exported or imported. No one can forbid the peoples of other countries from making revolutions, nor can one use the method of "helping the seedlings grow" to create revolutions in other countries. In June 1918, Lenin said well: "Some people think that revolutions can be made in other countries according to orders and agreements. These people are either madmen or instigators. In the past twelve years, we have experienced two revolutions. We know that revolutions cannot be made according to orders and agreements. Only when tens of millions of people think that they can no longer live like this, will a revolution break out." Besides the experience of the Russian Revolution, is not the experience of the Chinese Revolution also the best example? Our Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have also experienced several revolutions. The imperialists and all reactionaries are like madmen, always saying that our revolution is made according to some foreign order and agreement. However, the peoples of the world all know that our revolution is not imported from abroad, but because our people cannot continue to live in the old China, because our people demand to create a new life for themselves.

When socialist countries are forced to launch defensive wars and counterattacks due to imperialist aggression, like the Soviet Union in the war against Hitler, in order to pursue and annihilate these foreign enemies and thus cross the border, should this be done or not? Undoubtedly, this is completely necessary, completely just, and completely justified. According to the strict principles of communists, it must be absolutely limited to when imperialism launches aggressive wars against socialist countries, that socialist countries can do this. Socialist countries must not, should not, and cannot allow their military to cross the border in situations where they are not invaded by foreign enemies. The military of socialist countries is a just military. When they are forced to cross the border to counter foreign enemies, they will of course have an impact and play a role in the places they go, but even so, in those places, in those countries, they can only establish a socialist system according to the will of the local people.

The spread of revolutionary ideas has never had national borders. However, it can only bear revolutionary fruits in the specific conditions of a specific country, through the hands of the local people. This is not only the case in the era of proletarian revolution, but also completely the case in the era of bourgeois revolution. The bourgeoisie of various countries in the revolutionary era once regarded Rousseau's "Social Contract" as the gospel, while the revolutionary proletariat regards Marx's "Communist Manifesto," "Capital," and Lenin's "Imperialism is the Highest Stage of Capitalism," "The State and Revolution," etc., as the gospel. The times are different, the classes are different, the consciousness is different, the nature of the revolution is different, but as long as a country has the demand for that kind of revolution and when the revolutionary crisis matures, no one can stop the outbreak of the revolution. The replacement of all social systems in human history has been like this. Feudalism replaced slavery, capitalism replaced feudalism, and these are all objective laws that are not subject to the will of people. No matter how reactionaries try to stop the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will occur sooner or later and will inevitably be victorious. All social changes in human history have been like this.

The notorious old revisionist Bernstein once said the following: "Think back to ancient Rome, where there was also a ruling class that did not work but lived very well, and as a result, this class became weak. Such a class must gradually give up its rule." The fact that the slave-owning class "became weak" is a historical fact that Bernstein cannot conceal, just as the American imperialists cannot conceal the fact that they are becoming weaker and weaker today. However, this shameless, self-proclaimed historian Bernstein, he precisely wants to conceal the most basic fact of ancient Roman history, that is: the slave-owning class did not "give up its rule" by itself, but its rule was overthrown by long-term, repeated, and uninterrupted slave revolutions.

What is meant by revolution? It means that the oppressed class uses revolutionary violence, it means revolutionary war. The slave revolution is like this, and the bourgeois revolution is also like this. Lenin is right: "History proves that no oppressed class has ever taken power without a period of dictatorship, that is, seizing power and using violence to suppress the most ferocious and most desperate resistance of the exploiters, has ever taken power, or could take power.... The advanced bourgeoisie of the capitalist countries also took power through a series of uprisings, civil wars, and used violence to suppress the kings, feudal lords, slave-owners, and their attempts at restoration."

Why is it like this?

We must use Lenin's words to answer this question here.

First, as Lenin said: "There has never been a ruling class in the world that has voluntarily stepped down from power without a fight."

Second, as Lenin said: "The reactionary classes always use violence first, launch civil wars, 'bring the bayonets to the agenda.'"

Therefore, how do we imagine the socialist revolution of the proletariat?

We must use Lenin's following two passages to answer this question.

Let's read Lenin's following passage:

"History has never had a single revolution that did not go through a period of civil war, and no true Marxist has ever thought that socialism could be achieved without civil war."

Lenin's passage is very clear.

Let's read Lenin's following passage again:

"If socialism were to come about peacefully, the capitalist gentlemen would not want it to come about peacefully. This is not enough to say. If there were no war at all, all the capitalist gentlemen would also take various measures to prevent such peaceful development. Great revolutions, even if they begin peacefully like the French Revolution, end with the desperate wars launched by the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie."

The problem is again made very clear by Lenin.

The great October Revolution is the best factual witness to Lenin's these propositions. Our Chinese revolution is also the best factual witness to Lenin's these propositions. People will not forget: the Chinese people, the Chinese proletariat, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, after experiencing twenty-two years of brutal civil war, finally achieved victory and seized power on a national scale. The history of proletarian revolution in the West after the First World War tells us: even when the capitalist gentlemen are not directly and openly in power, but through their servants—the traitorous social democrats—acting as their agents, those despicable traitors will of course always protect the violent forces of the bourgeois white guards according to the will of the bourgeoisie, and throw the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat into a sea of blood. Germany at that time was like this. The defeated German big bourgeoisie handed over its power to the social democrats. The newly established government of the social democrats immediately carried out a bloody suppression of the German working class in January 1919. Everyone should recall how the "outstanding figures of the international proletariat" and the "immortal leaders of the international socialist revolution," Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, were killed by the violence of the social democrats at that time! Everyone should recall how Lenin said that those traitors—the so-called "socialists"—did such a "shameless and despicable" murder for the sake of protecting the capitalist system and the interests of the bourgeoisie. Everyone should recall, based on the bloody facts of the capitalist world in history and now, the ghost talk of the old revisionists and modern revisionists about "capitalism peacefully transitioning into socialism"!

As mentioned above, do we Marxist-Leninists reject the adoption of the policy of peaceful transition when there is the possibility of peaceful development? No, it is not like that.

Everyone knows that the great founder of scientific communism—Engels—in his famous work "Principles of Communism" once answered the question of "whether private property can be abolished peacefully." Engels answered: "If only it were so, the communists would hardly object to it. The communists know very well that any conspiracy is not only useless but also harmful. They know very well that revolutions cannot be made at will, nor can they be ordered. They are the inevitable result of various situations in any country. But at the same time, they also see that the development of the proletariat in almost all civilized countries is greatly suppressed, and they also see that the opponents of communism are doing everything possible to provoke revolution..."

Engels' passage, written more than a hundred years ago, is still so fresh to us today!

Everyone also knows that after the February Revolution in Russia, for a period of time, Lenin adopted the policy of revolutionary peaceful development due to the special conditions at that time. Lenin regarded this as a "rare opportunity in the history of revolution." He firmly grasped this opportunity. However, the bourgeois provisional government and the white guards destroyed the possibility of revolutionary peaceful development, and in the July peaceful demonstrations, the streets of Petrograd were filled with the blood of workers and soldiers. Therefore, Lenin pointed out: "The path of peaceful development has become impossible. The most painful path of non-peaceful development has begun."

Everyone also knows that after the end of the Anti-Japanese War in China, when the people of the whole country generally hoped for peace, our party once held peace talks with the Kuomintang, trying to achieve social and political reforms in China through a peaceful path, and reached an agreement with the Kuomintang in 1946 to implement domestic peace. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries violated the will of the people of the whole country, tore up this agreement, and launched a nationwide civil war with the support of American imperialism. This forced the Chinese people to have no choice but to wage a revolutionary war. Because we did not relax our vigilance and did not abandon the people's armed forces when we were striving for peaceful reforms, and because we made adequate preparations, the war did not frighten the people, but instead made the initiators of the war reap what they sowed.

If the proletariat can take power through peaceful means and transition to socialism, this is most beneficial to the people; if there is such a possibility and it is not utilized, it is wrong. Communists must, like Lenin, firmly grasp it when encountering such opportunities as "revolutionary peaceful development" to achieve the goal of socialist revolution. However, such opportunities are, as Lenin said, "very rare in the history of revolution." If within a country, a certain local power is already surrounded by revolutionary forces, and within the global scope, a certain capitalist country is already surrounded by socialism, in such a situation, there may be more possibilities for the opportunity of revolutionary peaceful development. However, even in such a situation, one must not think that revolutionary peaceful development is the only possibility, but must also prepare for the other possibility of revolutionary non-peaceful development. For example, after the liberation of the Chinese mainland, in some regions ruled by slave-owners and landlords, although they were already surrounded by the overwhelming revolutionary forces of the people, as a Chinese saying goes, "a cornered beast will fight to the death," the last struggle of a small number of the most reactionary slave-owners and landlords still took place, and only after these rebellions were suppressed, could the reform of the social system be carried out.

Can we say that in the current imperialist countries, when imperialists, in order to protect their savage and cannibalistic system, have never been as armed to the teeth as they are now, things will be as the modern revisionists say, that imperialism has become very "peaceful" towards the proletariat of their own country, the people of their own country, and the oppressed nations, and that the "rare opportunity" that Lenin talked about after the February Revolution will become the common state of the proletariat and all oppressed peoples in the world in the future? Can we say that the "rare opportunity" that Lenin talked about will become an opportunity that the proletariat of capitalist countries can easily grasp in the future? We believe that these statements are all groundless.

Marxist-Leninists must not forget this truth: the armed forces of all ruling classes are first and foremost for oppressing their own people. Imperialists can only oppress other countries and launch aggressive wars and unjust wars on the basis of oppressing their own people. They need to maintain and strengthen the reactionary armed forces to oppress their own people. Lenin wrote in the 1905 Russian Revolution: "The role of the standing army is more against internal enemies than against external enemies." For all countries where the exploiting classes are in power, for all capitalist countries, is this proposition correct or not? Can we say that it was correct at that time, but now it is wrong? In our view, this truth is still irrefutable today, and facts are increasingly proving its correctness. Seriously speaking, if the proletariat of any country does not see this, it cannot find the way to liberate itself.

In "The State and Revolution," Lenin concentrated the issue of revolution on the point of smashing the bourgeois state machine. He quoted the most important passages from Marx's "The Civil War in France," which wrote: "After the revolution of 1848-1849, state power became the 'national weapon of capital in the struggle against labor.'" The main machine of the bourgeois state power to carry out the struggle against labor is its standing army. Therefore, "the first decree of the Commune was to abolish the standing army and replace it with an armed people."

Therefore, our problem ultimately comes back to the principles of the Paris Commune; and as Marx said, the principles of the Commune are eternal and cannot be destroyed.

Marx in the 1870s once regarded Britain and the United States as exceptions, believing that there was the possibility of these two countries transitioning to socialism through a "peaceful" path because at that time the militarism and bureaucracy in these two countries were not yet highly developed. However, in the era of imperialism, according to Lenin's words, "the exception that Marx talked about has lost its validity," because these two countries "have already completely fallen into the general European-style, all-commanding, all-suppressing bureaucratic-military machine's filthy, bloody, and muddy swamp." This was a focal point of Lenin's debate with the opportunists at that time. The opportunists led by Kautsky distorted Marx's statement that "the exception has lost its validity," attempting to use it to oppose the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, that is, to oppose the proletariat's necessary armed struggle and armed revolution for liberation. Lenin gave Kautsky the following answer:

"The dictatorship of the revolutionary proletariat is the use of violence against the bourgeoisie; this violence is especially necessary because of the existence of military and bureaucratic machines, which Marx and Engels had repeatedly explained in detail in the 1870s.... But it was precisely in the 1870s, when Marx made this statement, that there were no such machines in England and America (and now such machines also exist in England and America)."

It can be seen that the proletariat adopts the means of armed revolution out of necessity. Marxists have always wanted to transition to socialism through a peaceful path; as long as there is a peaceful path to seek, Marxist-Leninists will not give up this path. However, when the bourgeoisie possesses a strong militaristic and bureaucratic oppression machine, the purpose of the bourgeoisie is to block such a path.

The above-quoted words are from Lenin's writing in November 1918. What is the situation now? Is it like what the modern revisionists say, that Lenin's words are only valid in history, but in the current situation, they are no longer valid? Everyone can see that the current situation is almost without exception, every capitalist country, especially the imperialist powers led by the United States, are frantically strengthening their militaristic and bureaucratic oppression machines, especially their military machines.

The 1957 November Declaration of the Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the Socialist Countries in Moscow states:

"Leninism teaches us, and historical experience also proves, that the ruling class will not voluntarily give up power. Therefore, the intensity and forms of class struggle are more determined by the degree to which the reactionary cliques resist the will of the majority of the people, and by whether these cliques use violence in this or that stage of the struggle for socialism."

This is a new summary of the international proletarian struggle experience in the decades since Lenin's death.

The question is not whether the proletariat wants or does not want peaceful change, but whether the bourgeoisie accepts or does not accept such peaceful change. As Lenin's students, we can only view this question in this way.

Therefore, unlike the modern revisionists who use the empty talk of peaceful transition to numb the revolutionary will of the people, Marxist-Leninists believe that only based on the specific conditions of different periods in each country can the possibility of peaceful transition to socialism be proposed. The proletariat must not one-sidedly and groundlessly build its thoughts, policies, and all work on the estimate that the bourgeoisie is willing to accept peaceful change, but must also prepare two hands, that is, prepare for the peaceful development of the revolution and also prepare for the non-peaceful development of the revolution. How to transition, whether it is through armed uprising or peaceful transition, is a different issue from the peaceful coexistence between socialist countries and capitalist countries, is an internal political issue, is an issue that can only be decided by the comparison of class forces in each country and each period, is an issue that can only be decided by the communists of each country themselves.

In 1919, after the October Revolution, Lenin once talked about the historical lessons of the Second International. He said that the proletarian movement of the Second International period was "developing horizontally to such an extent that the revolutionary level inevitably temporarily declined, opportunism inevitably temporarily strengthened, and finally the Second International suffered a shameful bankruptcy."

What is opportunism? According to Lenin's words: "Opportunism is to sacrifice fundamental interests for temporary and partial interests."

What is to lower the revolutionary level? This is that opportunists try to make the masses focus their attention on daily, temporary, and partial interests and forget long-term, fundamental, and overall interests.

Marxist-Leninists believe that one should look at the issue of parliamentary struggle from the perspective of long-term, fundamental, and overall interests.

Lenin told us about the limitations of parliamentary struggle, but he also warned communists to avoid the error of narrow-minded sectarianism. In his famous work "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," Lenin explained the experience of the Russian Revolution: under what conditions it is correct to resist parliament and under what conditions it is wrong to resist parliament. Lenin believed that every proletarian party should use all possible opportunities to participate in necessary parliamentary struggles. If communists only know how to talk about revolution, are not willing to do unyielding and patient work, and avoid necessary parliamentary struggles, this is fundamentally wrong and harmful to the cause of the revolutionary proletariat. At that time, Lenin criticized the refusal of communists in some European countries to participate in parliament. He said: "'Refusing' to participate in parliament is childish, because they want to 'solve' the difficult task of struggling against bourgeois democratic influences within the workers' movement with such a 'simple,' 'easy,' and seemingly revolutionary method, but in fact, they are only deceiving themselves, only closing their eyes to the difficulties, only using empty talk to avoid these difficulties."

Why participate in parliamentary struggles? Lenin believed that the purpose is to struggle against bourgeois democratic influences within the workers' movement, or as he said in another place, "the purpose is precisely to educate the backward strata of one's own class, precisely to awaken and enlighten the unenlightened, oppressed, and ignorant masses in the countryside."

That is to say, the purpose is to raise the political and ideological level of the masses, to unite parliamentary struggles with revolutionary struggles, rather than the opposite, to lower our political and ideological level and make parliamentary struggles separate from revolutionary struggles.

Again, to unite with the masses and not to lower the revolutionary level, this is the fundamental principle that Lenin told us to adhere to in the struggle of the proletariat.

Again, to participate in parliamentary struggles and not to be deluded by the bourgeois parliamentary system. Why? Because even if the workers' party gains a majority in parliament or becomes the largest party in parliament, as long as the bourgeois military and bureaucratic state machine remains intact, then parliament can only be an ornament of bourgeois dictatorship. Moreover, as long as the bourgeois military and bureaucratic state machine remains intact, the bourgeoisie can at any time, according to their own interests, in addition to dissolving parliament when necessary, also use various tricks, open or covert, to make the workers' party, which was originally the largest party in parliament, become a minority, or make the workers' party, even if it can obtain more votes in elections, reduce the number of parliamentary seats. Therefore, it is difficult to imagine that bourgeois dictatorship itself will change because of parliamentary votes; it is also difficult to imagine that the proletariat will be able to take peaceful measures to transition to socialism there because of how many parliamentary votes they obtain. The experience of a series of capitalist countries has long proven this point, and the experience of European and Asian countries after the Second World War has again proven this point.

Lenin said: "The proletariat cannot achieve victory without winning the majority of the population to its side. However, if this work of winning over is limited to or controlled by trying to gain a majority of votes under bourgeois rule, that is extremely stupid or deceiving the workers." Modern revisionists believe that Lenin's statement is outdated. However, the living facts before us prove that Lenin's statement is still a bitter pill for any revolutionary of the proletariat in any country.

Lowering the revolutionary level is to lower the theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism, to reduce political struggles to economic struggles, to reduce revolutionary struggles to merely parliamentary struggles, to trade principles for temporary interests.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Lenin already raised the issue of "a certain degree of lowering of the theoretical level with the widespread dissemination of Marxism" in his "What Is To Be Done?" He quoted Marx's opinion in the letter on the "Gotha Program," which mentioned that for the sake of achieving the practical goals of the movement, agreements can be made, but principles should not be traded, and theoretical "concessions" should not be made. Following this, Lenin wrote the following passage, which is now almost known to all communists. Lenin wrote: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement. When the narrow practical activity and the fashionable propaganda of opportunism are combined, we must always insist on this idea." For revolutionary Marxists, this is how important an enlightenment! The entire Russian revolutionary movement was, under the guidance of this idea of revolutionary Marxism insisted on by the great Lenin and the Bolsheviks, victorious in October 1917. In the above-mentioned issue, the Communist Party of China also had two experiences. The first was during the 1927 revolutionary period. At that time, Chen Duxiu's opportunism, in adopting the policy of the united front with the Kuomintang, lost the principled position that the Communist Party should have, advocating that the Communist Party be lowered to the Kuomintang in principle, resulting in the failure of the revolution. The second was during the Anti-Japanese War period. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China insisted on the Marxist-Leninist position, exposed the principled differences between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang's anti-Japanese stance, believing that the Communist Party could not make concessions to the Kuomintang in principle on the anti-Japanese stance, while Wang Ming, representing right-wing opportunism, repeated the mistake of ten years earlier, wanting to lower the Communist Party to the Kuomintang in principle. Therefore, our party waged a great struggle against right-wing opportunism. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "...If the Communist Party members forget this principle, they will not be able to correctly lead the Anti-Japanese War, they will be powerless to overcome the one-sidedness of the Kuomintang, they will reduce the communists to an unprincipled position, they will reduce the Communist Party to the Kuomintang. They will commit a crime against the sacred national revolutionary war and the task of defending the motherland." It was precisely because our party central insisted on not making concessions in principle, adopting a policy of both unity and struggle in the united front with the Kuomintang, that it consolidated and expanded our party's political and ideological positions, consolidated and expanded the national revolutionary united front, and as a result, in the Anti-Japanese War, it strengthened the people's forces and was able to smash the large-scale attack of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries after the end of the Anti-Japanese War and achieve great victory in the people's revolution on a national scale.

From the experience of the Chinese revolution, it can be seen that when the proletariat cooperates with the bourgeoisie politically, it is easy for our party to make right-wing errors, and when the proletariat politically breaks with the bourgeoisie, it is easy for our party to make "left" errors. In the process of leading the Chinese revolution, our party also conducted many struggles against "left" adventurism. "Left" adventurists cannot correctly handle the complex class relations in China from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism, do not understand that in different historical periods, different correct policies should be adopted against different classes, and simply implemented the wrong policy of only struggle and no unity. Without overcoming the errors of "left" adventurism, the Chinese revolution would not have been victorious.

From the perspective of Leninism, for the proletariat of any country to achieve revolutionary victory, it must have a genuine Marxist-Leninist party. This party is good at combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the revolution of its own country, and in each period correctly determines the object of the revolution, solves the problem of organizing the main force and allies, and solves the problem of relying on whom and uniting with whom. The revolutionary proletarian party must firmly rely on the masses of its own class, must firmly rely on the semi-proletariat in the countryside, that is, the broad masses of poor peasants, to establish an alliance of workers and peasants led by the proletariat, and then on this basis, it can unite all possible social forces, and it can also, according to the specific situation of different countries and different periods, establish a united front of the laboring people and non-laboring people who can be united. If this is not done, the proletariat will not be able to achieve the goal of revolutionary victory in each stage.

Modern revisionists and some representatives of the bourgeoisie try to make people believe that without a revolutionary party of the proletariat and without the correct policies of the revolutionary party of the proletariat mentioned above, socialism can be realized. This is absurd and is deceiving. Marx and Engels' "Communist Manifesto" once pointed out that at that time there were various kinds of "socialism," petty-bourgeois "socialism," bourgeois "socialism," feudal "socialism," etc. Now, due to the victory of Marxism-Leninism and the decay of the capitalist system, more and more people in the world yearn for socialism, and in some countries of the exploiting classes, there are even more various kinds of so-called "socialism." Just as Engels said, these so-called "socialists" also "want to use various panaceas and various patchwork methods to eliminate social disasters without harming capital and profits," and they "stand outside the workers' movement, preferring to seek help from the 'gentleman' class." They are only hanging the sign of "socialism" but acting in the interests of capitalism. In such a situation, adhering to the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism and waging an uncompromising struggle against all tendencies that lower the revolutionary level, especially against revisionism and right-wing opportunism, has extremely important significance.

In the current struggle to defend world peace, some people say that there is no need for ideological debates. Or they say that there is no difference in policies between communists and social democrats. This is equivalent to wanting to lower the ideological and political level of communists to the level of the bourgeoisie and social democrats. This view is influenced by modern revisionism and makes one deviate from the position of Marxism-Leninism.

The struggle for peace and the struggle for socialism are two different struggles. If these two different struggles are not properly distinguished, it is wrong. The social composition of those participating in the peace movement will naturally be more complex, including bourgeois pacifists. We communists stand at the forefront of defending world peace, at the forefront of opposing imperialist war, advocating peaceful coexistence, and opposing nuclear weapons. In such a movement, we must form necessary agreements with many complex social components to strive for peace; but at the same time, we must also maintain the principled position of the workers' party, not lower our political and ideological level, and not lower ourselves to the level of bourgeois pacifists in the struggle for peace. This involves the issue of both unity and criticism.

The "peace" of modern revisionists is to cover up the war preparations of imperialism, to sing the old tune of "super-imperialism" that has long been refuted by Lenin, to distort our communists' policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems into eliminating the people's revolution within countries. The old revisionist Bernstein has a notorious famous saying: "Movement is everything, and the goal is nothing." Modern revisionists also have similar sayings, that is: the peace movement is everything, and the goal is nothing. Therefore, the "peace" they talk about is completely limited to the "peace" that imperialists may accept under certain historical conditions, aiming to lower the revolutionary level of the peoples of all countries and make the peoples of all countries lose their revolutionary fighting spirit.

We communists struggle to defend world peace and strive to implement the policy of peaceful coexistence. At the same time, we support the revolutionary wars of oppressed nations against imperialism, we support the revolutionary wars of oppressed peoples for their own liberation and for social progress, because these revolutionary wars are just. Of course, we must also continue to explain to the masses Lenin's point about the capitalist imperialist system being the root cause of modern wars, and continue to explain to the masses the point of Marxism-Leninism that the ultimate goal of our struggle is to replace capitalist imperialism with socialism and communism. In front of the masses, we must not conceal our own principles.

We are now in a great new era where the imperialist system is further accelerating its collapse, and the peoples of the world are continuously advancing in victory and awakening.

Now, the peoples of all countries are much luckier than before, because in the more than forty years since the October Revolution, one-third of humanity has already freed itself from the oppression of capitalist imperialism, established a series of socialist countries, and in these countries, truly established a life of lasting domestic peace. They are influencing the fate of all mankind and will greatly accelerate the coming of a universal and lasting peaceful life for the whole world.

In all socialist countries, in the entire socialist camp, the most advanced is the great Soviet Union, the first socialist country created by the workers and peasants led by Lenin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, Lenin's ideals have been realized, socialism has long been built, and now, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government headed by Comrade Khrushchev, a great period of comprehensive construction of communism has begun. The heroic and highly intelligent workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the Soviet Union, in the struggle to achieve this great goal, have launched a great new upsurge of labor.

We Chinese communists and the Chinese people cheer for every new achievement of Lenin's homeland—the Soviet Union.

The Communist Party of China combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, leads the people of the whole country, and has won the great victory of the people's revolution. It has also followed the common path of socialist revolution and socialist construction pointed out by Lenin, carried the socialist revolution to the end, and has already begun to achieve great victories on all fronts of socialist construction. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on Lenin's principles, has creatively put forward the correct policy of the general line for building socialism, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes for the Chinese people under our country's conditions, inspiring the revolutionary spirit of innovation among the people of the whole country, and thus is changing the face of our country day by day.

The socialist countries of Eastern Europe and other socialist countries in Asia have also achieved leapfrog achievements in the cause of socialist construction under our common banner of Leninism.

Leninism is an invincible banner. The working people of the world firmly grasp this great banner, which means grasping the truth and opening up a road of continuous victory for themselves.

We will forever remember Lenin. And when modern revisionists attempt to defile the great banner of international proletariat—Leninism, our task is to defend Leninism.

Everyone will remember: In his famous work "The State and Revolution," Lenin once said about the fate of the revolutionary ideas and leaders of the oppressed classes in history. Lenin said that after their death, there would be distortions, "castrating the content of revolutionary doctrines, blunting their revolutionary edge, and vulgarizing them." Lenin went on to say: "Now the bourgeoisie and the opportunists in the workers' movement are tending to agree on this 'refinement' of Marxism. They separate, distort, and forget the revolutionary aspect and revolutionary spirit of this doctrine, and put what the bourgeoisie can accept or think they can accept in the first place and praise it." Indeed, we are now encountering some representatives of American imperialism again. They appear with the face of a priest, even calling Marx a "great thinker of the 19th century," even admitting that Marx's prediction in the 19th century about the short life of capitalism is "based on facts" and "correct," but these priests say that in the 20th century, especially in the past few decades, Marxism is no longer correct, because capitalism has already become outdated, has already ceased to exist, at least in America. We hear these ghost stories from the imperialist priests, and we will feel that the language of modern revisionists is in line with theirs. However, modern revisionists not only distort Marx's doctrine but also further distort the doctrine of the great successor and developer of Marxism—Lenin.

The Moscow Declaration points out: "Under the current conditions, the main danger is revisionism, or right-wing opportunism." Some people say that the judgment of the Moscow Conference is no longer applicable to the current situation. We believe that this view is wrong. This view will make people ignore the importance of fighting against the main danger of revisionism, which is very harmful to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat. Just as from the 1870s, there was a period of "peaceful" development of capitalism, and in that period, the old revisionism of Bernstein emerged, in the current situation where imperialism is forced to accept peaceful coexistence, and in many capitalist countries, there is still a certain "domestic peace," the tide of revisionism is most likely to spread and flood. Therefore, we must always maintain a high degree of vigilance against this main danger in the workers' movement.

As Lenin's students, as Leninists, we must completely smash the attempt of modern revisionists to distort and split Lenin's doctrine.

Leninism is the complete revolutionary doctrine of the proletariat, continuing to express the complete revolutionary worldview of the proletariat after Marx and Engels. This complete revolutionary doctrine, this complete revolutionary worldview, cannot be distorted and split. We believe that the attempt of modern revisionists to distort and split Leninism is only a manifestation of the last desperate struggle of imperialism. In the face of the continuous victories of communist construction in the Soviet Union, in the face of the continuous victories of socialist construction in various socialist countries, in the face of the increasingly solidified unity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, in the face of the continuous awakening of the peoples of the world to struggle bravely to free themselves from the shackles of capitalist imperialism, the attempt of the Tito revisionists is completely in vain. Long live the great Leninism!

    列宁主义万岁
    ——纪念列宁诞生九十周年
    红旗杂志编辑部
    一
    今年4月22日，是列宁诞生的九十周年。
    在列宁诞生后的第二年，即1871年，出现了英勇的巴黎公社起义。巴黎公社是一个划时代的伟大革命，是无产阶级企图推翻资本主义制度的具有全世界意义的第一次演习。当公社因凡尔赛的反革命进攻而临近失败的时候，马克思说：“即使公社被搞垮了，斗争也只是延期而已。公社的原则是永存的，是消灭不了的；在工人阶级得到解放以前，这些原则将一再表现出来。”①
    什么是公社的最主要的原则呢？按照马克思的说法，那就是：工人阶级不能简单地握取现成的国家机器，并运用它来达到自己的目的。换句话说，无产阶级应当采取革命手段，夺取政权，粉碎资产阶级的军事官僚机器，建立无产阶级专政以代替资产阶级专政。熟悉无产阶级斗争历史的人们都知道，正是在这个根本问题上，形成了马克思主义者同机会主义者、修正主义者的分水岭，而在马克思恩格斯逝世之后，正是列宁，他为了保卫公社的原则，对机会主义者、修正主义者进行了完全不调和的斗争。
    巴黎公社没有得到成就的事业，经过了四十六年，终于在列宁直接领导下的伟大十月革命中赢得了胜利。俄国苏维埃的经验是巴黎公社经验的继续和发展。为马克思恩格斯不断阐明、而为列宁根据俄国革命的新经验加以充实的公社原则，首先在地球六分之一的土地上，变成为活生生的事实。马克思说得完全正确：公社的原则是永存的，是消灭不了的。
    帝国主义的豺狼们企图绞杀新生的苏维埃国家，联合当时俄国的反革命势力，进行了武装干涉。但是，英勇的俄国工人阶级和苏联各族人民打走了这些外来的强盗，消灭了国内的反革命叛乱，从而巩固了世界上的第一个伟大的社会主义共和国。
    在列宁的旗帜下，在十月革命的旗帜下，以无产阶级革命为主导的新的世界革命开始了，人类历史的新纪元开始了。
    通过十月革命，列宁的声音迅速地传播到全世界。1919年中国人民反帝反封建的五四运动，正如毛泽东同志所说，“是在当时世界革命号召之下，是在俄国革命号召之下，是在列宁号召之下发生的”②。
    列宁的号召所以强有力，就是因为它是正确的。列宁在帝国主义时代的历史条件下，揭示了一系列的关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的不可辩驳的真理。
    列宁指出，少数资本主义强国的财政资本寡头，即帝国主义者，不仅在本国剥削人民群众，而且压迫和掠夺全世界，把世界大多数国家变成为他们的殖民地和附属国。帝国主义战争是帝国主义政策的继续。世界大战就是由于帝国主义者贪婪无厌，为争夺世界的市场、原料产地和投资场所，为重新瓜分世界，而发动起来的。只要世界上还存在着资本帝国主义，就还存在着战争的根源，还存在着战争的可能性。无产阶级应当引导人民群众认识战争的根源，为争取和平、反对帝国主义而斗争。
    列宁断言，帝国主义是垄断的、寄生或腐化的、垂死的资本主义，是资本主义发展的最后阶段，因而是无产阶级革命的前夜。无产阶级解放的实现，决不能经过改良主义的道路，而只能是经过革命的道路。资本主义国家的无产阶级解放运动应该同殖民地、附属国的民族解放运动结成联盟，这个联盟能够粉碎帝国主义者同殖民地、附属国的封建买办反动势力的联盟，因而不可免地要在全世界最终地结束帝国主义制度。
    根据资本主义经济上、政治上发展不平衡的规律，列宁得出结论：由于资本主义的发展在各个国家内是极不平衡的，社会主义将首先在一个或几个国家中获得胜利，而不能在一切国家内同时获得胜利。因此，即使社会主义在一个或几个国家中取得胜利，但是其他资本主义国家还存在，这就不仅会引起磨擦，而且会引起帝国主义颠复社会主义国家的活动。所以，斗争将是持久的。社会主义和资本主义的斗争，将包括一个整个的历史时代。社会主义国家随时都应当警惕帝国主义侵袭的危险，竭尽全力来防止这种危险。
    一切革命的根本问题，就是国家政权问题。列宁详尽地透彻地论述了无产阶级革命的根本问题，就是无产阶级专政问题。通过革命手段粉碎了资产阶级专政的国家机器而建立起来的无产阶级专政，是无产阶级同农民和其他一切劳动者的特殊的联盟，是阶级斗争在新条件下的另一形式的继续，是为镇压剥削阶级的反抗和抵抗外来的侵略，是为反对旧社会势力及其传统而进行的坚持的斗争，流血的与不流血的，强力的与和平的，军事的与经济的，教育的与行政的斗争。没有无产阶级专政，没有无产阶级专政在这些战线上充分发动劳动人民，顽强地和持续地进行这些不可避免的斗争，那就不可能有什么社会主义，就不可能有什么社会主义的胜利。
    列宁认为，要实现无产阶级革命，要实现和巩固无产阶级专政，头等重要的是无产阶级要建立自己的一个真正革命的、同机会主义完全决裂的政党，即共产党。这个政党是用马克思主义的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的理论武装起来的。这个政党的纲领，是组织无产阶级和一切被压迫的劳动人民进行阶级斗争，建立无产阶级的统治，经过社会主义而达到共产主义的最终目的。这个政党要同群众打成一片，重视群众的历史首创精神；在进行革命的时候，党要紧紧地依靠群众，在进行社会主义、共产主义建设的时候，党同样地要紧紧依靠群众。
    这些真理，是列宁在十月革命前后不断揭示的。当时，世界反动派和庸夫俗子们都把列宁揭示的这些真理，视为骇人听闻的东西。但是我们看到，这些真理正在世界的实际生活中节节胜利。
    从十月革命到现在，这四十多年中，世界上已经发生了新的巨大的变化。
    由于社会主义、共产主义建设的伟大成就，苏联把一个原来在帝俄时代是经济技术很落后的国家，变成为具有世界第一流最先进技术的国家了。苏联在经济上技术上的飞跃，把欧洲资本主义国家远远地抛在后面，而且在技术上也把美国抛到后面去了。
    以苏联为主力军的反法西斯战争的伟大胜利，冲破了帝国主义在中东欧的锁链。中国人民革命的伟大胜利，冲破了帝国主义在中国大陆上的锁链。一批新的社会主义国家诞生了。以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营有全地球四分之一的土地，而人口已经占世界总人口的三分之一以上。现在社会主义阵营已经形成一个独立的世界经济体系，而和资本主义的世界经济体系相对立。社会主义各国的工业总产值，现在已经占全世界工业总产值的将近40％，不用很久，就会超过资本主义各国的工业总产值。
    帝国主义的殖民地体系瓦解了，并且还在进一步瓦解中。斗争当然是曲折的，但是总的说来，民族解放运动的风暴正在日益广阔地席卷着亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲。事物的发展走向它的反面：帝国主义者在那里正在一步一步地由强者变为弱者，而那里的人民却一步一步地由弱者变为强者。
    第一次大战后一度存在过的资本主义相对稳定的局面早已结束。第二次大战后由于社会主义世界经济体系的形成，资本主义世界市场比过去大大缩小了。资本主义社会中生产力和生产关系的矛盾比过去更加尖锐化了。资本主义的周期性经济危机已经不是从前那样在每十年左右发生一次，而是几乎每三、四年发生一次。最近美国资产阶级的一些代表人物承认了美国在十年内遭遇过三次“经济衰退”，而且在刚渡过1957—1958年的“经济衰退”之后，现在感觉新的“经济衰退”要再来临了。资本主义经济危机的周期的缩短，是一种新的现象，它进一步地标志着世界资本主义制度越来越接近于它的不可避免的灭亡。
    资本主义各国发展的不平衡，比以前更加厉害了。帝国主义的地盘越来越窄，狭路相逢，美帝国主义正在不断地从英国、法国和其他帝国主义的手里，夺取它们原有的市场和势力范围。以美国为首的帝国主义各国在十几年来一直在扩军备战，而在第二次大战中被战败的西德日本两国军国主义，在它们原来的敌人美帝国主义者的帮助下又再起了。这两个帝国主义跑出来参预资本主义世界市场的争夺，现在重新在大谈特谈它们的“传统友谊”，正在进行所谓“以华盛顿为起点的波恩—东京轴心”的新活动。西德帝国主义已经肆无忌惮地在国外找寻军事基地。这样就加剧了帝国主义内部的激烈的冲突，同时，增加了对社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平的国家的威胁。现在情况很像第一次大战后美英帝国主义者扶助德国军国主义再起一样，而结果也将依然是他们“搬起石头打自己的脚”。美帝国主义者在第二次大战后制造世界紧张局势，并不是表明它的强大，而是表明它的虚弱，并且恰恰是反映了资本主义制度的空前未有的不稳定性。
    美帝国主义者，为了实现它的独霸世界的野心，不但处心积虑地对社会主义国家进行各种破坏和颠复活动，而且借口反对“共产主义威胁”，以镇压各国革命的世界宪兵自居，在世界上到处布置军事基地，夺取中间地带，进行军事挑战。像老鼠过街人人喊打一样，美帝国主义者到处都碰得皮破血流，到处都在相反地激起人民革命斗争的新高涨。现在连他们自己也感觉到，同以苏联为首的社会主义世界的欣欣向荣的景象比较起来，“美国作为一个世界大国的影响，正在衰落。”在他们那里，“只看到一个古罗马的衰亡时期”。
    四十多年来的世界变化，正是：帝国主义一天一天烂下去，社会主义一天一天好起来。我们现在面临着的是一个伟大的新时代，这个新时代的主要特点，就是社会主义的力量超过了帝国主义的力量，世界各国人民觉醒的力量超过了反动的力量。
    现在的世界形势，显然已经比列宁在世时期有了巨大的变化，但是这一切变化，不是证明列宁主义已经过时，而是恰恰相反，越来越鲜明地证实列宁所揭示的真理，越来越鲜明地证实列宁在保卫革命的马克思主义和发展马克思主义的斗争中所提出的全部学说。
      列宁在帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的历史条件下，把马克思主义推进到一个新的阶段，而为一切被压迫阶级和被压迫人民指明了一条真正能够摆脱资本帝国主义奴役和摆脱贫困的道路。
      这四十年，是列宁主义在世界上取得胜利的四十年，是列宁主义在世界上日益深入人心的四十年。列宁主义不但在已经建立了社会主义制度的各国中取得了并将继续取得伟大的胜利，而且在一切被压迫人民的斗争中不断取得新的胜利。
      列宁主义的胜利，得到了全世界人民的欢呼，同时也就不能不引起帝国主义者和一切反动派的仇视。帝国主义者，为了削弱列宁主义的影响，为了麻痹人民群众的革命意志，对列宁主义进行了最野蛮的、最卑鄙的攻击和污蔑，并且从工人运动内部收买、利用动摇分子和叛徒，指使他们对列宁的学说进行歪曲和阉割。在十九世纪末年，当马克思主义击溃各种反马克思主义的思潮，在工人运动中广泛传播，并获得统治地位的时候，以伯恩斯坦为代表的修正主义者，适应资产阶级的需要，提出对于马克思学说的修正；现在，当列宁主义引导世界工人阶级、一切被压迫阶级和被压迫民族向帝国主义和各种反动派进军而获得伟大胜利的时候，以铁托为代表的现代修正主义者，适应帝国主义者的需要，提出对于列宁学说（即现代的马克思学说）的修正。正如1957年11月在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言所说：“资产阶级影响的存在，是修正主义的国内根源。屈服于帝国主义的压力，则是修正主义的国外根源。”老的修正主义当时企图证明马克思主义已经过时，而现代修正主义则企图证明列宁主义已经过时。莫斯科会议宣言说：“现代修正主义企图诽谤马克思列宁主义的伟大学说，说它是‘过了时的’，似乎目前对于社会发展已经丧失了意义。修正主义者力图腐蚀马克思主义的革命灵魂，破坏工人阶级和劳动人民对于社会主义的信心。”宣言中这一段话，说得很正确，情形正是这样。
      马克思列宁主义的学说，到现在是否“过时”？
  列宁关于帝国主义、关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政、关于战争与和平、关于建立社会主义和共产主义的全部完整的学说，是否还保持着自己的充沛的生命力？如果它还有效，还有充沛的生命力，是指它的一部分，还是指它的整体？我们平常说，列宁主义是帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义，是社会主义、共产主义胜利时代的马克思主义，这个说法是否还保持它的正确性？能不能说列宁原来的结论和我们平常关于列宁主义的概念已经无效，已经不正确，因而我们应该回头去接受那些早已被列宁驳斥得体无完肤、早已在实际生活中无耻地破产了的修正主义、机会主义的结论？这些是当前摆在我们面前的必须回答的问题。马克思列宁主义者必须彻底揭穿帝国主义者和现代修正主义者在这些问题上的谬论，清除他们在群众中的影响，使一些暂时受他们蒙蔽的人们清醒过来，并且进一步激发人民群众的革命意志。
    二
    美帝国主义者，许多国家资产阶级的公开代表人、以铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义者和社会民主党右翼，他们为了把世界人民引入歧途，竭力对于现代世界形势进行完全歪曲的描绘，企图以此来证明他们的所谓“马克思主义过时了”、“列宁主义也过时了”这类呓语。
    铁托去年年底的一次讲话，反复地说了现代修正主义者的所谓“新时代”。铁托说：“今天世界已进入了各国可以松一口气并平静地致力于它们国内建设任务的新时代”。他又说，“我们已经进入了议事日程上出现了新问题的时代，这些问题不是战争与和平的问题，而是合作、经济和其他方面的问题，就经济合作而论，也还有经济竞赛的问题。”③这个叛徒完全抹杀了世界上阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的问题，企图勾销马克思列宁主义者历来关于我们的时代是帝国主义和无产阶级革命的时代，是社会主义、共产主义胜利的时代的解释。
    但是，世界上真实的情况是什么一回事呢？
    帝国主义本国被剥削被压迫的人民“可以松一口气”了吗？还在帝国主义压迫下的一切殖民地和半殖民地的人民“可以松一口气”了吗？
    在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，以美帝国主义者为首的武装干涉“平静”了吗？在美帝国主义者还在占领我国台湾的时候，我们的台湾海峡“平静”了吗？在阿尔及利亚和非洲的许多地区的人民遭受法、英等帝国主义的武装镇压的时候，非洲大陆“平静”了吗？在美帝国主义采取轰炸、暗害、颠复活动来破坏古巴的人民革命的时候，拉丁美洲“平静”了吗？
    所谓“致力于它们国内建设任务”，是“建设”些什么呢？大家知道，现在世界上存在着各种不同的国家，而主要的是有两类性质根本不同的社会制度的国家，一类属于社会主义世界体系的国家，一类属于资本主义世界体系的国家。铁托所说的，是帝国主义为压迫本国人民、压迫全世界、进行扩充军备的“国内建设”呢？还是社会主义为增进人民幸福、谋求世界持久和平的“国内建设”呢？
    战争与和平的问题，不能算成问题了吗？是帝国主义已经不存在，剥削制度已经不存在，因而也就不再存在战争的问题呢？还是让帝国主义和剥削制度永久存在下去，也不会有战争的问题呢？事实上，在第二次大战后，战争一直绵延不断。难道帝国主义镇压民族解放运动的战争，帝国主义武装干涉各国革命的战争，不算是战争吗？虽然这些战争还没有变成世界大战，但是，难道这类局部的战争不算是战争吗？虽然这些战争不是用核武器进行的，但是，难道用所谓常备武器进行的战争，不算是战争吗？是否美帝国主义者把1960年的将近60％的财政预算用于扩军备战，也不算是美帝国主义的好战政策呢？是否西德和日本的军国主义的复活，并不会给人类带来新的大战的危险呢？
    是什么“合作”呢？无产阶级同资产阶级“合作”保护资本主义吗？殖民地半殖民地人民同帝国主义
  “合作”保护殖民主义吗？社会主义国家同资本主义国家“合作”保护帝国主义制度去压迫本国人民、镇压民族解放战争吗？
    总之，按照现代修正主义者对于所谓“时代”的说法，就是在上述等等问题上，对列宁主义进行了挑战。他们的目的就是在于抹杀帝国主义国家本国人民群众和垄断资产阶级的矛盾，抹杀殖民地半殖民地人民和帝国主义侵略者的矛盾，抹杀社会主义制度和帝国主义制度的矛盾，抹杀爱好和平的世界人民和帝国主义好战集团的矛盾。
    对于“时代”的区别，本来有各种不同的说法。大体上说来，一种是胡吹瞎说，臆造和玩弄一些模模糊糊的、令人捉摸不定的辞句，从而掩盖时代的本质，这是帝国主义者、资产阶级和工人运动中修正主义者惯用的伎俩。一种是对于阶级矛盾和阶级斗争全局的具体情况进行具体分析，提出严格的科学规定，从而彻底揭露时代的本质，这是每个严肃的马克思主义者进行的工作。
    列宁这样提出区分时代的标志：“……这里谈的是历史上的大时代，无论过去或将来，每个时代都有个别的、局部的、时而前进时而后退的运动，都有脱离一般运动和运动的一般速度的各种倾向。我们无法知道，这个时代的某些历史运动的发展会有多末快，有多末顺利。但是我们能够知道，而且确实知道，那一个阶级是这个或那个时代的中心，决定着时代的主要内容、时代发展的主要方向、时代的历史背景的主要特点等等。只有在这种基础上，即首先估计到区别不同‘时代’的基本特征（而不是个别国家历史上的个别情节），我们才能够正确地制定自己的策略……”④。列宁这里说的，所谓时代，是那一个阶级成为时代中心的问题，是那一个阶级决定着时代主要内容、决定着时代发展主要方向的问题。
      忠实于马克思辩证法的列宁，时时刻刻都没有离开分析阶级关系的立场。他认为，“马克思主义，是根据日常生活千百万件事实上所表现的阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，来判断‘利益’的。”⑤他认为，“马克思的方法首先是考虑具体时间、具体环境中的历史过程的客观内容，以便首先了解，在这个具体环境里，那一个阶级的运动是可能推动社会进步的主要动力。”⑥列宁总是要我们根据阶级的分析，考察具体的历史发展过程，而不是去笼统地谈什么“一般的社会”，什么“一般的进步”。我们马克思主义者不能够单单根据某些眼前事变，某种细小的政治变动，来规定无产阶级的政策，而是应该从整个历史时代的阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的全局，来规定无产阶级的政策。这是马克思主义者的基本理论阵地。列宁正是牢牢地占领了这个阵地，而在阶级变化的新时期，在历史的新时期，得出了关于人类的希望全在于无产阶级的胜利，无产阶级必须准备在这个大革命的搏战中赢得胜利，从而建立无产阶级专政的结论。在十月革命后，1918年俄共
  （布）第七次代表大会上，列宁说过：“我们应当从商品生产的发展、向资本主义的过渡以及资本主义发展为帝国主义这个总的基础出发。这样，我们从理论上来占领和巩固阵地，任何一个没有背叛社会主义的人都不会把我们赶出这个阵地。同时，也可以从这里得出同样必然的结论：社会主义革命的时代已经开始了。”这就是列宁的结论，而且一直到现在，还是需要一切马克思主义者深思的结论。
    革命的马克思主义者关于我们的时代是帝国主义和无产阶级革命的时代，是社会主义、共产主义胜利时代的提法，是不可能推翻的，因为这种提法完全正确地把握了我们现在这个大时代的基本特征。关于列宁主义是革命马克思主义在这样大时代中的继续和发展的提法，关于列宁主义是无产阶级革命、无产阶级专政的理论和政策的提法，也是不可能推翻的，因为正是列宁主义揭露了我们这个大时代中工人阶级与垄断资本的矛盾，帝国主义各国相互间的矛盾，殖民地半殖民地人民与帝国主义的矛盾，无产阶级获得胜利的社会主义国家与帝国主义国家的矛盾，因此，列宁主义也就成了我们胜利的旗帜。但是，同革命马克思主义这一系列的提法相反，在铁托们那种所谓“新时代”里面，实际上是，帝国主义不见了，无产阶级革命不见了，无产阶级革命、无产阶级专政的理论和政策当然也不见了。总之，在他们那里，看不见我们时代的阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的根本焦点，找不到列宁主义的根本问题，找不到列宁主义。
    现代修正主义者硬说，在他们的所谓“新时代”里，由于科学技术的进步，马克思、列宁所提出的
  “旧概念”已经不适用了。铁托提出了这样的说法：
  “我们不是教条主义者，因为马克思和列宁没有预言月球火箭、原子弹和巨大的技术进步”⑦。很好，不是教条主义者。谁要他们当教条主义者呢？但是，可以是为了马克思列宁主义而反对教条主义，也可以是反教条主义其名，而反对马克思列宁主义其实。铁托们就是属于后面这一类。在科学技术的进步对于社会发展起什么影响的问题上，有一种人，他们因为不能够用唯物史观来看待它，就产生了不正确的看法，这是可以理解的，但是现代修正主义者却故意在这个问题上制造混乱，利用科学技术的进步，妄图推翻马克思列宁主义。
    近几年来，苏联在科学技术上的成就，站在世界的最前列。苏联的这些成就，是伟大十月革命的产物。这些突出的成就，标志着人类征服自然界的新纪元，同时对于保卫世界和平的事业起了很重大的作用。但是，在现代技术发展的新条件下，是不是像铁托所说的，马克思列宁主义的思想体系，业已被马克思列宁所“没有预言”的“月球火箭、原子弹和巨大的技术进步”所动摇了呢？能不能说，马克思列宁主义世界观、社会历史观、道德观等等基本观念，业已因此变成了所谓陈腐的“教条”，阶级斗争的规律已经从此再不存在呢？
    马克思和列宁没有活到现在，当然没有可能看见现代世界上技术进步的一些具体情况。但是，自然科学的发展，技术的进步，对于资本主义制度说来，究竟是预兆着什么？他们认为，这只是预兆着新的社会革命，决不是预兆着社会革命会消失下去。
    我们知道，马克思和列宁都是为自然科学和技术征服自然界的新发现和进步而欢欣鼓舞。恩格斯在“马克思墓前的演说”中曾说过：
    “科学在马克思看来是一种在历史上起推动作用的、革命的力量。虽然任何理论科学中的每个新的甚至尚无从预见其实际应用的发现都使他感到异常喜悦，但当有了立即会对工业、对一般历史发展起革命影响的发现的时候，他所感到的喜悦更是完全不同了”。恩格斯在说这段话之后，接着又说“须知，马克思首先是一个革命家”。说得很对啊！马克思总是以无产阶级革命家的观点，而不是以无产阶级革命消失论者的观点，去看待一切征服自然界的新发现的。威廉·李卜克内西在“回忆马克思”一文里说：
   “马克思嘲笑欧洲得胜的反动势力，它们幻想革命已被窒息，而没有想到自然科学正在准备一次新的革命。蒸汽大王在前一世纪中翻转了整个世界；现在它的统治已到末日；另外一种更大得无比的革命力量——电力的火花将取而代之。
    ……这件事的后果是不可估计的。经济革命之后，一定要跟着政治革命，因为后者只是前者的表现而已。
    在马克思谈到科学与力学的这种进步时，他的世界观，尤其是现在所谓的唯物史观，表现得如此清晰，使我前此依旧保持着的某些疑点，像春天阳光下的积雪一样地融化了。”
    马克思就是这样从科学和技术的进步那里，感到革命的气息的。他认为，科学技术的新进步将会引起推翻资本主义制度的社会革命。在马克思看来，自然科学和技术的进步，是进一步加强马克思主义整个世界观的阵地，加强唯物史观的阵地，而绝不是在动摇它。自然科学和技术的进步，是进一步地加强无产阶级革命和被压迫民族进行反对帝国主义斗争的阵地，而决不是在削弱它。
    同马克思一样，列宁也是把技术的进步同社会制度的革命问题联系起来观察的。列宁就是这样地认为：“蒸汽时代是资产阶级的时代，电气时代是社会主义的时代”⑧。
    请把马克思、列宁的这种革命精神同现代修正主义者背叛革命的可耻态度比较一下吧！在阶级社会，在帝国主义时代，马克思列宁主义者总只能用阶级分析的观点，去看待技术的发展和使用的问题。由于社会主义制度是进步的，是代表人民利益的，因此，社会主义国家要利用原子能和火箭等类新技术来服务于国内和平建设，来征服自然界。社会主义国家对于这类新技术掌握得越多，发展得越快，就将进一步达到高速度发展社会生产力从而满足人民需要的目的，同时，就将进一步增强制止帝国主义战争的力量，增加保卫世界和平的可能性。所以，为社会主义各国人民的福利，为全世界人民的和平利益，各个社会主义国家，只要有可能，都应当越来越多地掌握这类为人民谋福利的新技术。现在，社会主义的苏联对于新技术的发展已经显著地占着优势。人们知道，打中月球的火箭正是苏联发射的，而不是由资本主义最发达的国家美国发射的。这一点说明：只有在社会主义国家，才能够有大量发展新技术的无限前途。
    相反，由于帝国主义制度是反动的、反人民的制度，所以，帝国主义国家要把这类新技术用于侵略外国和威胁本国人民的军事目的，用于制造杀人的武器。对于帝国主义国家来说，这类新技术的出现，只是把社会生产力的发展和资本主义生产关系的矛盾推进到一个更新的阶段，它所带来的，决不是什么资本主义要永远生存下去，而将只能是进一步激发它本国人民的革命，将只能是资本主义这个吃人的罪恶的旧制度的毁灭。
    美帝国主义者和它的伙伴，利用原子弹这类武器对全世界进行战争威胁，进行讹诈。他们说，谁不服从美帝国主义的统治，谁就要遭到毁灭。铁托集团也随声附和，为美帝国主义帮腔，在人民群众中散播原子战争的恐怖。美帝国主义的讹诈和铁托集团的帮腔，只能暂时迷惑不明真相的人，但是吓不倒觉悟了的人民；就是暂时不明真相的人，也会在先进分子的帮助下逐步明白过来。
    马克思列宁主义者历来认定，在世界历史上，决定人类命运的，并不是技术，而是人，是人民群众。在中国抗日战争前和抗日战争期间，在有些人中曾经一度流行所谓“唯武器论”，说什么日本武器新，技术高，什么中国武器旧，技术低，所以，他们的结论是所谓“中国必亡”。毛泽东同志当时发表的“论持久战”，驳斥了这类胡说。他作了如下的分析：日本帝国主义者侵华战争必败，因为它是反动的，不义的，是失道寡助的；而中国人民抗日战争必胜，因为它是进步的，正义的，是得道多助的。毛泽东同志指出：战争的威力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中，而由人民群众觉悟起来、团结起来所组织的人民军队，将无敌于天下。这是马克思列宁主义的论点。结果如何呢？结果是：马克思列宁主义的论点胜利了，而那些什么“亡国论”终于失败了。第二次大战后，在朝鲜战争中，朝中人民打败了在武器装备上比自己高得多的美国侵略者，又一次证明了这个马克思列宁主义的论点。
    觉悟的人民总会找出新的办法去抵制反动派的武装优势，从而取得自己的胜利。过去历史是这样，现在和将来也还是这样。由于社会主义的苏联在军事技术上已经占了优势，使美帝国主义者失去了原子武器和核武器的垄断地位，同时，由于世界人民的觉悟，美国本国人民的觉悟，在现在世界上就存在着成立禁止原子武器和核武器协定的可能性。我们是力求能够成立这类协定的。同好战的帝国主义者相反，社会主义各国和全世界爱好和平的人民，都是积极地、坚决地主张禁止和销毁原子武器和核武器。我们总是为反对帝国主义战争而斗争，总是为禁止原子武器和核武器而斗争，总是为保卫世界和平而斗争。这种斗争进行得越广泛，越深入，把美帝国主义者和其他帝国主义者的好战成性的残暴面貌揭露得越全面，越彻底，那末，也就越能够把美帝国主义者和其他帝国主义者在世界人民面前孤立起来，就越有可能束缚美帝国主义者和其他帝国主义者的手足，就越有利于世界和平的事业。反之，如果我们对帝国主义发动战争的危险丧失了警惕性，不努力发动各国人民起来反对帝国主义，把人民的手足束缚起来，那么，帝国主义就可以为所欲为地进行战争的准备，其结果就必然增加帝国主义发动战争的危险，而在战争爆发时，人民就可能因为毫无准备或准备不足，而不能够迅速地采取正确的态度对待战争，从而不能够有力地制止战争。当然，帝国主义者究竟打不打，不是由我们决定的，我们终究不是帝国主义者的参谋长。只要各国人民提高了觉悟，有了充分的准备，在社会主义阵营也已掌握了现代武器的条件下，可以肯定，如果美帝国主义者或其他帝国主义者拒绝达成禁止原子武器和核武器的协议，而且一旦敢于“冒天下之大不韪”，用原子武器和核武器进行战争，结果将只是这些在世界人民包围中的野兽自身很迅速地被毁灭，而决不会是什么人类的毁灭。帝国主义发动罪恶的战争，始终是我们所反对的，因为帝国主义战争会给各国人民（包括美国和其他帝国主义国家的人民）带来巨大的牺牲。但是，如果帝国主义者把这种牺牲硬加在各国人民头上，我们相信，正如俄国革命和中国革命的经验一样，这种牺牲是会得到代价的。胜利的人民，他们在帝国主义死亡的废墟上，将会以极迅速的步伐，创造出比资本主义制度高千百倍的文明，创造起自己真正美好的将来。
    结论只能是：不论从那一方面来看，原子能、火箭等等，这些新的技术，都没有像现代修正主义者所说的那样，已经改变列宁所指出的帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的基本特征。资本帝国主义制度，是绝对不会自己倒下去的，它将被本国的无产阶级革命和殖民地半殖民地的民族革命所推倒。当代技术的进步，不能挽救资本帝国主义制度灭亡的命运，而只是给资本帝国主义制度敲了一次新的丧钟。	三
    现代修正主义者，从他们对现代世界形势的荒谬论断出发，从他们的那种所谓马克思列宁主义的阶级分析和阶级斗争的理论已经过时的荒谬论断出发，企图在暴力、战争、和平共处等一系列问题上，根本推翻马克思列宁主义的基本原理。
    此外，还有些人，他们并不是修正主义者，他们是好心善意的人，真诚愿望做一个马克思主义者，可是面对着某些历史的新现象，感到迷惑，有了一些不正确的想法，例如他们中有人说，美帝国主义的原子讹诈政策的失败，就是暴力的终结。在我们彻底驳斥现代修正主义者的谬论的同时，也应当帮助这些好心善意的人改正自己的不正确的想法。
    什么叫暴力？关于这个问题，列宁在“国家与革命”这本书里说得很多了。国家的出现和存在，本身就是一种暴力。列宁介绍了恩格斯以下的说明：“……构成这个权力的，不仅有武装队伍，而且还有实体的附属物，如监狱以及其他种种强迫机关……”。列宁告诉我们，必须区别资产阶级专政的国家和无产阶级专政的国家这两种不同性质的国家，区别反革命的暴力和革命的暴力这两种不同性质的暴力，有反革命的暴力，就必然会有革命的暴力来反对它。没有革命的暴力，就不可能消灭反革命的暴力。剥削阶级占统治地位的国家，就是一种反革命的暴力，就是代表剥削阶级对被剥削阶级实行镇压的特别力量。在帝国主义者没有原子弹或火箭武器以前，和有了这类新武器以后，帝国主义的国家始终是镇压本国无产阶级和国外殖民地半殖民地人民的特殊力量，始终是这样的暴力机关；即使帝国主义者被迫不能使用这类新武器，帝国主义国家只要还没有被推翻，而代之以人民的国家，代之以本国无产阶级专政的国家，它当然依旧是帝国主义的暴力机关。
    从有史以来，还没有过像现在资本帝国主义者形成了的这样大规模的极端凶残的暴力。十多年来，美帝国主义者一直肆无忌惮地采取比以前野蛮百倍的折磨手段，蹂躏本国工人阶级的杰出的儿子，蹂躏黑人，蹂躏一切进步人士，而且一直肆无忌惮地公开宣称要把全世界放在它的暴力统治之下。它继续不断地在扩张自己的暴力，同时其他帝国主义者也在从事加强暴力的竞赛。
    以美国为首的帝国主义各国的军事膨胀，是在空前沉重的资本主义总危机下出现的。帝国主义越是疯狂地把它的军事力量发展到最高点，就越是意味它们本身接近于灭亡。现在连有些美帝国主义者的代表人，也预感到了资本主义制度灭亡的必然性。但是，是不是因为帝国主义已经接近于灭亡，帝国主义就会自己终结自己的暴力，帝国主义国家的当权者就会自行放弃原来建立起来的暴力呢？
    能不能说，帝国主义者比起过去的时期说来，已经不成为暴力的爱好者，或者对于暴力的爱好程度已经下降了呢？
    对于像这类的问题，列宁早已给了多次的回答。在“帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段”一书中，他是这样指出的：“……帝国主义在政治方面总是力图施用暴力和实行反动的”。十月革命后，他在“无产阶级革命和叛徒考茨基”一书中，还特别叙述了历史，把垄断前的资本主义和垄断资本主义即帝国主义的差别，作了一番比较。他说：“垄断前的资本主义（它的全盛时期也正是在十九世纪七十年代），由于它的根本的经济特点（这种特点在英美表现得特别典型），比较地说，最爱和平，最爱自由。但是帝国主义，即在二十世纪才完全形成的垄断资本主义，由于它的根本的经济特点，则最不爱和平，最不爱自由，到处发展军国主义”。当然，列宁这些话，是在十月革命初期说的，那时无产阶级的国家才新生，它的经济力量还很幼弱，而经过了四十多年，如我们前面所叙述的，苏维埃国家本身和全世界都已经大大改变了面貌。那么，是不是因为苏联力量的强大，社会主义力量的强大，和平力量的强大，帝国主义的本性就已经改变，因而列宁的上述论断已经过时？或者说，帝国主义的本性虽然没有改变，但是它将再不使用暴力？这种看法是否合乎真实的情况呢？
    在社会主义世界体系和资本主义世界体系的斗争中，社会主义体系已经很明显地占了优势。这一个伟大的历史事实削弱了帝国主义在全世界所拥有的暴力的地位。但是，这个事实会不会使帝国主义者从此不再压迫本国人民，不再向外扩张，进行侵略活动呢？会不会使帝国主义者的好战集团从此就“放下屠刀”、“卖刀买牛”呢？会不会使帝国主义国家的军火商集团从此就改营和平的行业呢？
    所有这些问题，都放在当前一切严肃的马克思列宁主义者面前，而必须加以深思熟虑。显然，对这些问题看待得正确不正确，处理得正确不正确，是同无产阶级事业的成败和全世界人类的命运密切相关的。
    战争是暴力所表现的最尖锐的形式。一种是国内战争，一种是国外战争。暴力并不是经常都用战争这样尖锐化的形式表现出来。在资本主义国家，资产阶级的战争是资产阶级平时政策的继续，资产阶级的和平是资产阶级战时政策的继续。资产阶级总是互相交替地采取战争与和平这两种形式去实行对人民统治和对外斗争。在所谓和平时期，帝国主义者依靠武装力量，用逮捕、监禁、苦役、屠杀等等这类暴力的形式去对付被压迫阶级和被压迫民族，同时又准备使用战争这类暴力的最尖锐的形式去镇压国内人民的革命，去进行对外的掠夺，去压倒外国的竞争者，去扑灭外国的革命；或者是，国内和平和国外战争同时存在。
    在十月革命初期，各帝国主义者采取战争形式的暴力对付苏联，这是各帝国主义政策的继续；在第二次大战中，德帝国主义者采用大规模战争形式的暴力向苏联进攻，这是德帝国主义政策的继续。但是另方面，帝国主义者在各个不同时期又同苏联建立和平共处的外交关系，这当然也是帝国主义政策在一定条件下的另一种形式的继续。
      的确，现在出现了有关和平共处的一些新问题。帝国主义者站在强大的苏联的面前，站在强大的社会主义阵营的面前，他们终究要考虑考虑，他们如果向苏联进攻，向社会主义国家进攻，会不会像希特勒一样反而加速自己的灭亡，会不会对于资本主义制度本身反而带来最严重的后果。
      “和平共处”，这是十月革命后世界上出现了社会主义国家以后才产生的一个新概念，是列宁在十月革命前所预见的关于“社会主义不能在一切国家内同时获得胜利，它将首先在一个或几个国家中获得胜利，而其余国家在某些时间内将仍然是资产阶级的或资产阶级前期的国家”⑨这一种情况中所形成的新概念，是列宁在伟大的苏联人民战胜了帝国主义的武装干涉之后所提出的新概念。如上所述，起初，帝国主义者并不愿意同苏联和平共处。只是在干涉苏联的战争遭到失败之后，只是经过了几年的实际较量之后，只是在苏维埃国家业已站住了脚之后，只是在苏维埃国家和帝国主义国家业已形成某种均势之后，帝国主义者才被迫得同苏联“共处”。1920年，列宁说，“我们已经争得能够同资本主义列强共处的条件，这些强国现在已经不得不同我们建立贸易关系了”⑩。可见世界上第一个社会主义国家能够同帝国主义实行一定时期的和平共处，完全是斗争得来的。在第二次大战之前，从1920年到1940年德国进攻苏联之前，是帝国主义和苏联和平共处的时期。在这二十年间，苏联一直遵守和平共处的信义。但是，到1941年，希特勒就不愿同苏联和平共处了，德帝国主义者背信弃义地向苏联举行了野蛮的进攻。由于以伟大苏联为主力军的反法西斯战争的胜利，在世界上重新出现了社会主义国家同资本主义国家和平共处的局面。可是，帝国主义者是并没有死心的。美帝国主义在苏联和整个社会主义阵营周围到处建立军事基地和导弹基地网。美帝国主义一直到现在，还占领着我们的台湾，在台湾海峡随时向我们进行军事挑衅。美帝国主义武装干涉朝鲜，曾经在朝鲜土地上同朝鲜人民和中国人民进行过规模很大的战争，而结果是由于美帝国主义的失败才缔结了停战协定，但是直到现在，它还在干涉朝鲜人民的统一。美帝国主义用武器援助了法帝国主义占领军反对越南人民的战争，直到现在，也还在干涉越南人民的统一。美帝国主义曾经在匈牙利制造反革命的叛乱，一直到现在，还在东欧社会主义国家和其他社会主义国家，不断地企图利用各种方法，进行颠复活动。事实还是如列宁在1920年2月间对美国记者所说的，在和平问题上，“我们这方面没有什么障碍。美国（以及其他国家）资本家方面的帝国主义才是障碍”?。
    社会主义国家的外交政策只能是和平政策。社会主义制度决定我们不需要战争，决不会去发动战争，决不许可、决不应该、也决不能够侵占邻国的一寸土地。中华人民共和国自从成立以来，一直坚持和平的外交政策。我国同印度和缅甸这两个邻邦共同倡导了著名的和平共处的五项原则；我国还在1955年的万隆会议上和亚非各国共同通过了和平共处的十项原则。几年以来，我国共产党和我国政府一贯支持以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏共中央和苏联政府为争取和平所进行的活动，认为苏共中央和苏联政府所进行的争取和平的活动，在世界各国人民面前，进一步地证明了社会主义国家的和平外交政策的坚定性，也进一步地证明了各国人民制止帝国主义发动新世界大战和争取世界持久和平的必要性。
    1957年的莫斯科会议宣言说：“维护着和平事业的是当代的这些强大的力量：不可摧毁的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营；站在反帝立场上并且同社会主义国家一起构成广大和平地区的亚非爱好和平的国家；国际工人阶级，首先是它的先锋队——共产党；殖民地和半殖民地人民的解放运动；世界各国人民争取和平的群众运动。坚决反抗新战争的策划的，还有欧洲宣布中立各国的人民，拉丁美洲的人民以及帝国主义国家的人民群众。这些强大力量的联合可以阻止战争的爆发。”只要继续发展这些强大力量，和平共处的局面就有可能继续保持，甚至可以正式取得某种和平共处的协定，以至有可能达成禁止原子武器和核武器的协定。这是完全符合于世界各国人民的愿望的好事。但是，即使在这样的情况下，只要帝国主义制度还存在，作为暴力最尖锐化的形式，即战争，也并没有在世界上结束。事情并不是像南斯拉夫修正主义者所说的那样，列宁在反对机会主义的时候所反复说明、反复坚持的“战争是政策的继续”的定义，已经过时。?
    我们相信列宁的思想是完全正确的：战争是剥削制度的必然产物，现代战争的根源是帝国主义制度。在帝国主义制度和剥削阶级死亡以前，这样性质或那样性质的战争，总还是会出现的。可能是帝国主义为重新瓜分世界而发生的相互间的战争，可能是帝国主义和被压迫民族之间的侵略和反侵略的战争，可能是帝国主义国家内被剥削阶级和剥削阶级之间的革命和反革命的国内战争，当然也还可能是帝国主义进攻社会主义国家而社会主义国家被迫进行防御的战争。所有这一切战争，都是一定阶级的政策的继续。马克思列宁主义者绝不能陷入资产阶级和平主义的泥坑，对于这一切战争的问题，只能采用具体的阶级分析的方法，来加以理解，并由此得出无产阶级在政策上的结论。正如列宁在“无产阶级革命的军事纲领”一文中所说：“如果忘记任何战争都不过是政策用别种手段的继续，那在理论上是完全错误的”。
    帝国主义为着达到它的掠夺、压迫的目的，总是有它的两手，一手是战争，一手是“和平”；因此，各国无产阶级和各国人民一定也要有两手来对付帝国主义，一手是揭穿帝国主义的和平欺骗，竭力争取真正的世界和平，一手是准备在帝国主义发动战争的时候，用正义战争来结束帝国主义的不义战争。
    总之，为着世界各国人民的利益，在暴力、战争、和平共处这些问题上，都必须粉碎现代修正主义的谬论，坚持马克思列宁主义的观点。
    南斯拉夫修正主义者否认暴力所固有的阶级性，因而抹杀革命暴力和反革命暴力的根本区别；否认战争所固有的阶级性，因而抹杀正义战争和非正义战争的根本区别；他们否认帝国主义战争是帝国主义政策的继续，否认帝国主义重新发动大战的危险性，否认只有在剥削阶级消灭之后才有消灭战争的可能性，以至于无耻地把美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔叫做是“消除冷战和建立持久和平及不同政治制度间和平竞赛的奠基人”?；他们否认在和平共处的条件下还存在复杂的、激烈的，包括政治、经济、意识形态各方面的斗争；等等，——南斯拉夫修正主义者这些论点，都是为了毒害各国无产阶级和各国人民的思想，而有利于帝国主义的战争政策。
    四
    现代修正主义者把社会主义国家的对外和平政策和资本主义国家内的无产阶级对内政策混为一谈，因而认为不同社会制度的国家和平共处，就是资本主义可以和平长入社会主义，就是在资产阶级统治下的各国无产阶级可以抛弃阶级斗争，可以和资产阶级，和帝国主义者，实行“和平合作”，就是无产阶级和一切被剥削阶级应该忘记他们是在阶级社会中生活着，等等——这些论点也都是同马克思列宁主义根本对立的。他们的目的是要保护帝国主义的统治，企图使无产阶级和一切劳动群众永远接受资本主义的奴役。
    各国和平共处，和各国人民革命，本来是两件事，而不是一件事；是两个概念，而不是一个概念；是两类问题，而不是一类问题。
    和平共处，说的是国家与国家相互关系的问题；革命，说的是本国被压迫人民推翻压迫阶级的问题，而对殖民地半殖民地国家说来，首先是推翻国外压迫者即帝国主义者的问题。在十月革命以前，世界上没有什么社会主义国家和资本主义国家和平共处的问题，因为那时还没有社会主义国家；可是，世界上却存在了无产阶级革命和民族革命的问题，因为各国人民根据本国的具体情况，早已把这类革命或那类革命摆在决定自己国家命运的议事日程上。
    我们是马克思列宁主义者，我们一直认为，革命是每一个民族自己的事情。我们一直认为，工人阶级只能自己解放自己，而某一个国家人民的解放，要依靠自己国内人民的觉悟，自己国内革命成熟的条件。革命不能输出，也不能输入。谁也不能不许别国人民进行革命，也不能用“揠苗助长”的方法去制造别国的革命。在1918年6月间，列宁说得好：“有人以为，革命可以在别的国家里按照定单和协议来进行。这些人不是疯子，就是挑拨者。近十二年来，我们经历了两次革命。我们知道，革命是不能按照定单和协议进行的，只有当千千万万的人认为不能再这样生活下去的时候，革命才会爆发”?。除了俄国革命的经验以外，中国革命的经验不也是一个最好的例证吗？我们中国人民在中国共产党领导下也经历了几次革命。帝国主义者和一切反动派也是像疯子一样，总说我们的革命是按照什么外来的定单和协议进行的。但是，全世界人民都知道我们的革命并不是由国外输入的，而是因为我国人民群众不能够在旧中国继续生活下去，因为我国人民要求创造自己的新生活。
      当社会主义国家由于帝国主义进攻而被迫进行防御战争并举行反攻的时候，像苏联在反希特勒的战争中那样，为着追击和消灭这种从国外来的敌人因而越出国境，这应该不应该呢？毫无疑问，这是完全应该的，完全必需的，完全正义的。根据共产主义者的严格的原则，必须是绝对地限制在帝国主义向社会主义国家发动侵略战争的时候，社会主义国家才能够这样做。社会主义国家决不许可、决不应该、也决不能够在不是受到国外敌人侵略的情况下，使自己的军队越出国境。社会主义的国家的军队是正义的军队，在他们因为反击国外敌人而不得不越出国境的时候，当然会在他们所到的地方，发生影响，发生作用，但是，即使这样，在那些地方，在那些国家，也还只能根据人民群众的意志，才能够出现人民的革命，才能够建立起社会主义制度。
    革命思想的传播，从来没有国家的界限。但是它只有在具体国家的具体条件下，经过人民群众的手，才会获得革命的果实。不仅在无产阶级革命的时代是这样，在资产阶级革命的时代也完全是这样。处在革命时代的各国资产阶级曾经把卢梭的“民约论”当作福音，而革命的各国无产阶级则把马克思的“共产党宣言”、“资本论”和列宁的“帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段”、“国家与革命”等等当作福音。时代不同，阶级不同，意识不同，革命性质不同，而只要那个国家有那种革命的要求，并且在革命危机成熟的时候，就谁也阻止不了革命的爆发。社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。人类有史以来一切社会的更迭，都是这样。封建制度代替奴隶制度，资本主义制度代替封建制度，这些也都是不以人们自己的意志为转移的规律，而所有这些更迭，也都是通过革命。
    臭名远扬的老修正主义者伯恩斯坦曾经说过以下一段话：“你们回想一下古罗马吧，那里也曾有过一个统治阶级，它不从事劳动而只是生活得很好，结果这个阶级变弱了。这样一种阶级必须逐渐地交出它的统治。”?所谓奴隶主“这个阶级变弱了”，这是伯恩斯坦不能掩盖的历史事实，正如现在美帝国主义者也不能掩盖自己日益变弱这个现实的事实一样。但是，这一个无耻的、以历史家自命的伯恩斯坦，他偏偏想掩盖古代罗马史如下的最基本的事实，那就是：奴隶主并不是自己“交出它的统治”，它的统治是被长期的、反复的、绵延不断的奴隶革命所打垮的。
    所谓革命，就是意味着被压迫阶级使用革命的暴力，意味着革命战争。奴隶革命是这样，资产阶级革命也是这样。列宁说得对：“历史证明，从来没有一个被压迫阶级，不经过专政时期，即夺取政权并用暴力镇压剥削者的最猛烈最疯狂的反抗，就取得了统治，就能够取得统治。……先进国家的资产阶级也是经过一系列起义、内战，用暴力镇压国王、封建主、奴隶主及其复辟企图才取得政权的。”?
      为什么事情会是这样的？
      我们在这里还得用列宁的话来回答问题。
    第一，正如列宁所说的：“世界上还没有一个不经过斗争就自动下台的统治阶级。”?
      第二，正如列宁所说的：“反动阶级总是自己首
  先使用暴力，发动内战，‘把刺刀提到日程上来’。?
      因此，我们怎样去设想无产阶级的社会主义革命呢？
      我们还得再用列宁以下两段话来回答问题。
      我们读一读列宁以下的一段话吧：
          “历史上从来没有过一次不经过国内战争的大革命，并且也没有一个真正的马克思主义者会认为，不经过国内战争就能从资本主义过渡到社会主义”。?
      列宁这一段话是把问题说得很清楚的。
      我们再读一读列宁以下的又一段话吧：
        “假使社会主义以和平方式产生，资本家先生们也是不愿意让它这样产生的。这样说还有点不够。假使连战争也没有，所有的资本家先生也会采取种种办法制止这种和平发展。伟大的革命即使像法国大革命那样以和平方式开始，也是以反革命资产阶级所发动的疯狂战争而告终。”?
      问题又被列宁说得很清楚了。
      伟大的十月革命就是列宁这些论断的最好的事实的见证者。我们中国革命同样地也是列宁这些论断的最好的事实的见证者。人们不会忘记：中国人民，中国无产阶级，是在中国共产党的领导下，经过了二十二年的残酷的国内战争，才在全国范围内取得胜利，取得政权的。第一次大战以后西方无产阶级革命的历史告诉我们：即使资本家先生们不是直接地、公开地掌握政  权，而是经过它们的仆役——社会民主党那些叛徒们代理政权的时候，那些卑鄙的叛徒也当然会随时按照资产阶级的意旨，掩护资产阶级的白卫军暴力，把无产阶级的革命战士们投入血泊里。当时的德国就是如此。战败了的德国大资产阶级把自己的政权交给社会民主党人掌管。刚上台的社会民主党的政府立即在1919年1月向德国工人阶级实行了血腥的镇压。请大家回忆回忆被列宁所称为“世界无产阶级国际的优秀人物”、“国际社会主义革命的永垂不朽的领袖”卡尔·李卜克内西、卢森堡等，是怎样地在当时的社会民主党人的暴力下面流了他们的鲜血吧！请大家回忆回忆列宁所说的，那些叛徒们——所谓“社会主义者”是怎样地为了保护资本主义制度和资产阶级利益，“所干的这种杀人勾当的卑鄙无耻”?吧！请大家根据历史上和现在资本主义世界一切血淋淋的事实，想想老修正主义者和现代修正主义者所谓“资本主义和平长入社会主义”那一连篇的鬼话吧！
      照上所说，是否我们马克思列宁主义者在有和平发展的可能条件下，也拒绝采用和平过渡的方针呢？不。绝不是这样的。
      大家知道，科学共产主义的伟大创始人之一——恩格斯在“共产主义原理”这个有名的著作中曾经回答过“能不能用和平的办法来废除私有制”的问题。恩格斯答：“但愿如此，共产主义者很少想反对这样办的。共产主义者知道得很清楚：任何密谋都不但无益，而且有害。他们知道得很清楚：革命既不能随心所欲地制造，也不能定做，它们在任何地方都是完全不以个别政党和整个阶级的意志和领导为转移的各种情况的必然结果。但同时，他们也看到，几乎所有文明国家的无产阶级的发展都大受压制，并且也看到共产主义者的反对者这样做，无异是想尽方法引起革命……”。
    恩格斯这一段文字，是在一百多年前写的，但直到现在，我们读起来还是多末新鲜呵！
    大家更知道，在俄国二月革命后的一段时间里，由于当时的特殊条件，列宁采取过革命和平发展的方针。列宁认为这是“革命历史上非常罕见的机会”?。他紧紧地抓住这个机会。但是，资产阶级临时政府和白卫军破坏了这种革命和平发展的可能性，而在7月间群众和平性质的示威中，使彼得格勒的街道流遍了工人和士兵的鲜血。因此，列宁指出：“和平发展的道路已成为不可能的了。开始了非和平的、最痛苦的道路。”?
    大家也知道，在中国抗日战争结束以后，当全国人民普遍热望和平的时候，我们党曾经同国民党进行和平谈判，试图经过和平的道路实现中国的社会政治改革，并且在1946年同国民党达成了一个实行国内和平的协议。但是，国民党反动派违背全国人民的意志，撕毁了这个协议，在美帝国主义支持下发动了全国的大内战。这就迫使中国人民不能不进行革命的战争。由于我们在争取和平改革的时候，没有放松警惕，没有放弃人民武装，而且做了充分的准备，所以战争并没有吓倒人民，反而使战争的发动者自食其果。
    如果无产阶级能够用和平方式取得政权，过渡到社会主义，这是对于人民最有利益的；有这种可能而不利用这种可能，是不对的。共产党人一旦在遇有“革命和平发展”这类机会的时候，必须像列宁那样紧紧抓住它，去实现社会主义革命的目的。但是，这类机会，总是如列宁所说的，是“革命历史上非常罕见的机会”。如果在一国范围内，某一个地方政权已经处于革命力量包围之中，在全世界范围内，某一个资本主义国家已经处于社会主义包围之中，在这种情形下，或许有较多的可能出现革命和平发展的机会。但是，即便是在这样的情形下，也绝不能认为革命和平发展是唯一的可能性，而应当同时准备革命非和平发展的另一种可能性。例如，在中国大陆解放以后，某些由奴隶主和农奴主统治的局部地区，虽然已经处于绝对优势的人民革命力量包围之中，但是，正如中国一句老话，“困兽犹斗”，那里一小撮最反动的奴隶主和农奴主还是要最后挣扎，拒绝和平改革，举行了武装叛乱，而只有在这些叛乱平定之后，才能实行社会制度的改革。
    能不能说，在现在帝国主义国家，在帝国主义者为着保护它们的野蛮的吃人的制度，从来都还没有像现在这样一直武装到牙齿的时候，事情会如现代修正主义者所说的那样，帝国主义已经对本国无产阶级、本国人民和被压迫民族变得非常“和平”，因而列宁在二月革命后所说的那种“革命历史上非常罕见的机会”，就将是今后世界上无产阶级和一切被压迫人民遇到的经常状态呢？因而列宁所说的那种“罕见的机会”，就将是今后资本主义国家无产阶级俯拾即是的机会呢？我们认为，这种种说法都是毫无根据的。
    马克思列宁主义者都不能忘记这个真理：一切统治阶级的武装首先就是为的压迫本国的人民。帝国主义者只有在压迫本国人民的基础上才可能压迫其他国家，才可能发动侵略，才可能进行不义的战争。他们要压迫本国人民，就需要维持和加强反动的武装力量。列宁在1905年的俄国革命中，曾经写道：“常备军的作用，与其说是反对外部敌人，不如说是反对内部敌人”?。对于一切剥削阶级占统治地位的国家说来，对于一切资本主义国家说来，这个论点对不对呢？能否说在当时是对的，而到现在已经是错了的？在我们看来，这个真理到现在仍然是驳不倒的，并且事实越来越证明它的正确性。认真地说，任何一个国家的无产阶级如果没有看清这一点，就不能找到解放自己的道路。
    列宁在“国家与革命”的著作中，把革命问题集中到打碎资产阶级国家机器这一点上。他摘录马克思的“法兰西内战”一书最重要的几段话，其中写道：“在1848年至1849年革命以后，国家政权就成为‘资本用以进行反劳动战争的全国武器’。”资产阶级政权进行反劳动战争的主要机器，就是它的常备军。因此，“公社所颁布的第一个法令，就是废除常备军而代之以武装的人民”。
    所以，我们的问题，结果还是要回到巴黎公社的原则；而正如马克思所说，公社的原则是永存的，是消灭不了的。
    马克思在十九世纪七十年代曾经把英国和美国看成例外，认为这两个国家有经过“和平的”道路过渡到社会主义的可能性，因为那时候这两个国家的军国主义和官僚制度还不大发展。但是，到了帝国主义时代，照列宁的说法，“马克思所说的这个例外已经失去时效”，因为这两个国家“已经完全落入一般欧洲式的，号令一切，压制一切的官僚军阀机关的污浊血腥泥潭中了”?。这是列宁同当时机会主义者论战的一个焦点。以考茨基为代表的机会主义者歪曲马克思那个“已经失去时效”的说法，企图用来反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，即反对无产阶级为着争得解放，必需有革命的武力和武力的革命。列宁给考茨基以如下的回答：
     “革命无产阶级的专政，是用暴力手段对付资产阶级；这个暴力手段之所以特别必要，是因为存在有军阀机关与官僚制度，关于这点，马克思恩格斯曾多次极详尽地说明过……。但是，正是在马克思发表这个意见时的十九世纪七十年代，恰恰是在英美两国没有存在这些机关（而现在，这样的机关在英美也有了）”?。
    可见，无产阶级采用武力革命的手段，是出于被迫的。马克思主义者从来愿意经过和平的道路过渡到社会主义；只要有和平的道路可寻，马克思列宁主义者就不会放弃这条道路。但是，当资产阶级拥有强大的军国主义和官僚制度的压迫机器的时候，资产阶级的目的就是在堵塞这样的道路。
    上面引述的话，是列宁在1918年11月间写的。而现在的情况又是如何呢？是不是像现代修正主义者所说的那样，列宁那些话只在历史上是可以算数的，而在现在情况下已经不能算数呢？大家都看到，现在的情况是差不多没有例外的，每一个资本主义国家，特别是以美国为首的几个帝国主义大国，都在拼命地加强它们的军国主义和官僚制度的压迫机器，尤其是它们的军事机器。
    1957年11月在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言上说：
          “列宁主义教导我们，而且历史经验也证明，统治阶级是不会自愿让出政权的。这样，阶级斗争的剧烈程度和所采取的形式，与其说是决定于无产阶级，不如说是决定于反动集团对于绝大多数人民的意志抵抗到什么程度，决定于在争取社会主义斗争的这一或那一阶段上这些集团是不是采取暴力。”
      这是列宁逝世后几十年间，国际无产阶级斗争经验的新总结。
      问题并不是无产阶级愿意不愿意进行和平的变革，而是资产阶级接受不接受这种和平的变革。作为列宁的学生，对于这个问题就只能这样地看待。
      所以，同那些用和平过渡的空谈来麻痹人民革命意志的现代修正主义者相反，马克思列宁主义者认
  为，只有根据每一个国家的不同时期的具体条件，才能够提出和平过渡到社会主义的可能性的问题。无产阶级决不能片面地、没有根据地把自己的思想、方针和
  全部工作建筑在资产阶级愿意接受和平变革的估计上面，而必须同时准备两手，就是准备革命的和平发展，又准备革命的非和平发展。如何过渡，是武装起义过渡，还是和平过渡，这是同社会主义国家和资本主义国家之间和平共处根本不同的另一个问题，是每个国家内政的问题，是只能由每个国家每个时期的阶级力量对比关系去决定的问题，是只能由每个国家的共产党人自己作出决策的问题。			五
    列宁在十月革命后的1919年，说过第二国际的历史教训。他说，第二国际时期的无产阶级运动是“向横广方向发展，以致革命水准不免暂时降低，机会主义不免暂时加强，而终于使第二国际遭到了可耻的破产”?。
    什么叫做机会主义？根据列宁的说法：“机会主义是牺牲根本的利益，贪图暂时的局部的利益”?。
    什么叫做降低革命水准？这就是机会主义者力图使群众把自己的注意力放在日常的、暂时的、局部的利益上面，而忘记长远的、根本的、全局的利益。
    马克思列宁主义者认为，应当从长远的、根本的、全局的利益着眼来看待议会斗争的问题。
    列宁告诉了我们关于议会斗争的局限性，但是，他也警告共产主义者必需避免犯偏狭的宗派主义的错误。列宁在“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”这一本名著中，说明了俄国革命的经验：在什么条件下抵制议会是正确的，而在什么条件下抵制议会则是错误的。列宁认为，每一个无产阶级政党都应当利用各种可能的机会参加必要的议会斗争。如果共产党员只会讲革命的空话，不愿意做不屈不挠的耐心的工作，回避必要的议会的斗争，这在根本上是错误的，对于革命无产阶级的事业只有害处。当时列宁批评了欧洲一些国家的共产党员拒绝参加议会的错误。他说：“‘拒绝’参加国会的幼稚气，就在于他们想用这样‘简单的’、‘轻易的’、似乎是革命的方    法，来‘解决’与工人运动内部的资产阶级民主    影响作斗争这一种困难任务，而事实上他们只是掩耳盗铃，只是闭起眼睛不看困难，只是用空话来回避这种困难罢了。”
    为什么要参加议会的斗争？列宁认为，其目的就在于同工人运动内部的资产阶级影响作斗争，或者如他在另一处所说的，“其目的正是在于教育本阶级的落后阶层，正是在于唤醒和启发乡村中不开通的、被抑压的和愚昧无知的群众”。
    这就是说，目的在于提高群众的政治水平和思想水平，把议会的斗争同革命的斗争统一起来，而不是相反地要使我们降低自己的政治水平和思想水平，使议会的斗争脱离了革命的斗争。
    又要同群众打成一片，又不要降低革命水平，这就是列宁告诉我们在无产阶级斗争中必须坚持的一个根本原则。
    又要参加议会的斗争，又不要迷信资产阶级的议会制度。为什么？因为，即使工人政党在议会中取得多数，或者成为议会中的第一大党，但是，只要资产阶级的军阀和官僚的国家机器原封不动，那末，议会也还只能是资产阶级专政的装饰品，并且，只要资产阶级的军阀和官僚的国家机器原封不动，资产阶级完全可以随时根据自己利益的需要，除了在必要时采取解散议会的办法以外，还能够采取公开或幕后的各种把戏，使议会中原来第一大党的工人阶级政党变成少数派，或者使工人阶级政党纵使能够在选举中得到比以前更多的选票，而却减少了议会的席位。因此，很难设想，资产阶级专政本身会因议会的选票而发生变化；也很难设想，无产阶级会因为获得多少议会选票，而就有可能在那里采取和平过渡到社会主义的措施。一系列资本主义国家的经验老早已经充分证明了这一点，而第二次大战后欧洲和亚洲各国的经验又对这一点再作了新的证明。
    列宁说：“无产阶级要是不把大多数居民争取到自己方面来，就不能取得胜利。但是，如果把这种争取工作局限于或者受制于设法在资产阶级统治下获得大多数选票，那就是极端愚蠢或欺骗工人”?。现代修正主义者认为列宁这个说法是陈旧了的。但是，摆在我们眼前的活生生的事实，证明了列宁这个说法，对于任何一个国家的无产阶级革命家来说，却依然是苦口良药。
    降低革命水准，就是降低马克思列宁主义的理论水准，就是把政治斗争降低到经济斗争，把革命的斗争降低到仅仅局限于议会的斗争，就是为了暂时的利益，而拿原则去做交易。
      在二十世纪初年，列宁在他的“做什么”？一书中就已经提出要注意“随着马克思主义的广泛传播而发生了理论水平的某种程度的降低”的问题。列宁引述了马克思论“哥达纲领”一封信内所提的意见：为达到运动的实际目的起见，可以缔结条约，但决不要拿原则来交易，决不要作理论上的“让步”。接着，列宁写了以下一段话，这一段话到了现在几乎已经为一切共产党人所熟知了。列宁是这样写的：“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。当醉心于最狭隘实际活动的偏向与机会主义的时髦宣传打成一片的时候，我们必须始终极力坚持这一思想”。对于革命的马克思主义者说来，这是多末重要的启示呵！整个的俄国革命运动，就是在以伟大的列宁为首的布尔塞维克党坚持革命的马克思主义的理论这一思想的指引下，而在1917年10月取得胜利的。在上述的问题上，中国共产党也有过两次的经验。第一次是在1927年革命时期。当时陈独秀的机会主义对于我们党同国民党的统一战线所采取的政策，就是失掉了共产党应有的原则立场，主张在原则上把共产党降低到国民党，结果使革命失败。第二次是抗日战争时期，中国共产党中央坚持马克思列宁主义的立场，揭开了共产党同国民党的抗战主张的原则分歧，认为共产党决不能在抗日主张的原则上对国民党让步，而以王明为代表的右倾机会主义则重复了十年前陈独秀的错误，要在原则上把共产党降低到国民党。因此，我们全党同右倾机会主义者展开了一场很大的论战。毛泽东同志说：“……如果共产党员忘记了这个原则性，他们就不能正确地指导抗日战争，他们就将无力克服国民党的片面性，就把共产主义者降低到无原则的地位，把共产党降低到国民党。他们就是对于神圣的民族革命战争和保卫祖国的任务犯了罪过”?。正是由于我们党中央在原则上毫不让步，对于我们党同国民党的统一战线，采取了又联合又斗争的政策，因而巩固了和扩大了我们党在政治上思想上的阵地，因而也巩固了和扩大了民族革命的统一战线，结果就在抗日战争中壮大了人民力量，并且使我们能够在抗日战争结束之后，粉碎了蒋介石反动派的大规模进攻，而在全国范围内取得了伟大的人民革命的胜利。
    根据中国革命的经验看来，当无产阶级同资产阶级在政治上合作的时候，在我们党内就容易发生右倾的错误，而当无产阶级同资产阶级在政治上决裂的时候，在我们党内就容易发生“左”倾的错误。我们党在领导中国革命的过程中，也曾经多次地进行了反对“左”倾冒险主义的斗争。“左”倾冒险主义者不能用马克思列宁主义观点来正确处理中国的复杂的阶级关系，不懂得在不同的历史时期，针对不同的阶级，采取不同的正确政策，而简单地实行了只斗争、不联合的错误政策。不克服这种“左”倾冒险主义的错误，中国的革命也是不能够胜利的。
    根据列宁主义的观点，任何一个国家的无产阶级要取得革命的胜利，必须有一个真正马克思列宁主义的党，这个党善于把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和本国革命的具体实践结合起来，在各个时期正确地确定革命的对象，解决组织主力军和同盟军的问题，解决依靠谁和团结谁的问题。革命的无产阶级政党必须紧紧地依靠本阶级的群众，必须紧紧地依靠农村中的半无产阶级，即广大贫农群众，建立以无产阶级为领导的工农联盟，然后才可能在这个联盟的基础上团结一切可能团结的社会力量，并且，也才有可能按照不同国家不同时期的具体情况，建立劳动人民和可以团结的非劳动人民的统一战线。如果不这样，无产阶级就不可能在各个阶段达到革命胜利的目的。
    现代修正主义者和某些资产阶级的代表人，企图使人相信，没有无产阶级的革命政党，没有无产阶级革命政党的上述一系列的正确政策，就可以实现社会主义。这是荒谬绝伦的说法，这完全是欺骗。马克思和恩格斯的“共产党宣言”曾经指出，当时有各种各样的“社会主义”，有小资产阶级的“社会主义”，有资产阶级的“社会主义”，有封建的“社会主义”，等等。现在，由于马克思列宁主义的胜利，由于资本主义制度的腐败，世界各国中，越来越多的人民群众向往社会主义，在一些国家的剥削阶级中，也就更多地出现了五花八门的所谓“社会主义”。正像恩格斯所说的那样，这些所谓“社会主义者”也“想用各种万应药方和各种补缀办法来消弭社会灾难而毫不伤及资本和利润”，他们“站在工人运动以外，宁愿向‘士大夫’阶级请求援助”?。他们不过是挂“社会主义”的招牌，行资本主义的实际。在这样的情形下，坚持马克思列宁主义的革命原则，同一切降低革命水准的倾向，特别是同修正主义、右倾机会主义进行不调和的斗争，就具有极其重要的意义。
    在目前保卫世界和平的问题上，也有人说，什么意识的争论已经不需要了。或者说，什么共产党人和社会民主党人已经没有方针的分歧了。这就等于要把共产党的思想水平和政治水平降低到资产阶级和社会民主党人的水平。这种说法就是受了现代修正主义的影响，而使自己脱离了马克思列宁主义的阵地。
    争取和平的斗争和争取社会主义的斗争，这是两种不同的斗争。如果没有把这两种不同的斗争适当地加以区别，就是错误的。参加和平运动的社会成份，当然要复杂得多，其中还包括了资产阶级的和平主义者。我们共产党人站在保卫世界和平的最前线，站在反对帝国主义战争、主张和平共处、反对核武器的最前线。在这样的运动中，我们要同许多复杂的社会成份在一起，为争取和平而成立必要的协定；但是，我们又必须同时保持工人阶级政党的原则性，不要降低自己的政治水平和思想水平，不要在争取和平的斗争中把自己降低到资产阶级和平主义者的水平。这就存在着又联合又批评的问题。
    现代修正主义者嘴里的“和平”，是在于给帝国主义的战争准备作粉饰工作，是在重弹那些老早被列宁驳斥过的老机会主义者所谓“超帝国主义”的论调，是把我们共产党人关于两种不同制度国家和平共处的政策，曲解为消灭各国内部的人民革命。老修正主义者伯恩斯坦有句可耻的有名的话，叫做“运动是一切，而目的是没有的”。现代修正主义者也有类似的说法，就是：和平运动是一切，而目的是没有的。因此，他们所谈的“和平”，完全局限于为帝国主义者在一定历史条件下可能接受的“和平”，是企图降低各国人民的革命水准，使各国人民失却革命的斗志。
    我们共产党人为保卫世界和平而斗争，为争取实现和平共处的政策而斗争。同时，我们支持被压迫民族反对帝国主义的革命战争，我们支持被压迫人民争取自己解放、争取社会进步的革命战争，因为这些革命战争都是正义的。当然，我们还必须继续向群众说明列宁关于资本帝国主义制度是现代战争根源的论点，还必须继续向群众说明马克思列宁主义关于我们斗争的最后目的就是用社会主义和共产主义来代替资本帝国主义的论点。在群众面前，我们必须不掩盖我们自己的原则。
    六
    我们现在正处在帝国主义制度进一步地加速崩溃、全世界人民的胜利和觉醒不断地向前发展的伟大新时代。
    现在全世界各国人民比过去要幸运得多了，因为在十月革命之后四十多年间，已经有三分之一的人类摆脱了资本帝国主义的压迫，成立了一系列的社会主义国家，在这些国家内，真正地建立着国内持久和平的生活，他们在影响着全人类的命运，而将大大加速全世界的普遍的持久的和平日子的到来。
    在所有社会主义国家中，在整个社会主义阵营中，站在最前列的，是伟大的苏联，是列宁和苏联共产党领导工人农民首创的第一个社会主义国家。在苏联，已经实现了列宁的理想，早已建成了社会主义，而且现在正在以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏共中央和苏联政府的领导下，开始着一个全面建设共产主义的伟大时期。苏联的英勇的、具有巨大智慧的工人、农民和知识分子，在为建成共产主义这一个伟大目标的斗争中，掀起了伟大的劳动的新高涨。
    我们中国共产党人和中国人民为列宁主义的故乡——苏联的每一个新成就而欢呼。
    中国共产党把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合，领导全国人民，赢得了伟大的人民革命的胜利，并且沿着列宁所指出的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同大道，把社会主义革命进行到底，已经开始在社会主义建设的各个战线上获得了伟大的胜利。中国共产党中央根据列宁的原则，在我国的条件下，创造性地给我国人民提出了建设社会主义的总路线、大跃进和人民公社的正确方针，鼓舞了全国群众的首创的革命精神，因而正在日新月异地改变着我国的面貌。
    东欧各社会主义国家，亚洲的其他社会主义国家，同样地在我们的共同的列宁主义的旗帜下，在社会主义建设事业中，取得了飞跃的成就。
    列宁主义是战无不胜的旗帜。世界劳动人民紧紧地掌握着这个伟大的旗帜，就是掌握着真理，就是为着自己开辟不断胜利的道路。
    我们永远地纪念着列宁。而当现代修正主义者企图沾污列宁主义这个国际无产阶级的伟大旗帜的时候，我们的任务，就是要保卫列宁主义。
    大家都会记得：列宁在他的名著“国家与革命”里，说过历史上各被压迫阶级解放斗争中的革命思想家和领袖的学说的遭遇。列宁说，在他们逝世后，就会出现曲解，“阉割革命学说的内容，磨灭其革命锋芒，而使之庸俗化。”列宁接着说：“现在资产阶级和工人运动中的机会主义者在这样‘修琢’马克思主义的事情上正趋于一致了。他们把这学说的革命方面和革命精神加以割裂、曲解和遗忘，而把资产阶级可以接受或觉得可以接受的东西，提在第一位，加以颂扬。”是呵，现在我们正是又遇到了美帝国主义的一些代表人，他们又以神甫的脸孔出现，甚至称说马克思是“十九世纪的伟大思想家”，甚至承认马克思在十九世纪关于资本主义寿命不长的预言是“有根据的”，是“正确的”，但是，这些神甫们说，到了二十世纪，特别是最近几十年，马克思主义就不正确了，因为资本主义业已过时，业已停止存在，至少在美国是这样。我们听到帝国主义神甫们这些鬼话，就会感觉到现代修正主义者的语言，是同他们趋于一致的。但是，现代修正主义者并不限于曲解马克思的学说，而且还进一步地曲解马克思主义的伟大继承者和发展者——列宁的学说。
    莫斯科会议宣言指出：“在目前条件下，主要的危险是修正主义，或者说右倾机会主义。”有人说，莫斯科会议的这个判断已经不适合于今天的情况。我们认为，这种说法是错误的。这种说法会使人忽视对修正主义这个主要危险进行斗争的重要性，很有害于无产阶级的革命事业。正如从十九世纪七十年代开始，曾经有一段资本主义“和平”发展时期，在那个时期产生了伯恩斯坦的老修正主义一样，在现在帝国主义被迫接受和平共处的情况下，在许多资本主义国家还处于某种“国内和平”的情况下，修正主义的思潮最容易滋长和泛滥。因此，我们对于工人运动中的这种主要危险，不能不经常保持高度的警惕。
    作为列宁的学生，作为列宁主义者，我们必须完全粉碎现代修正主义者曲解和割裂列宁学说的企图。
      列宁主义是无产阶级的完整的革命学说，是在马克思恩格斯之后继续表达了无产阶级思想的完整的革命世界观。这个完整的革命学说，完整的革命世界观，不能加以曲解和割裂。我们认为，现代修正主义者曲解和割裂列宁主义的企图，不过是帝国主义末日垂死挣扎的一种表现而已。在苏联的共产主义建设节节胜利的面前，在各社会主义国家的社会主义建设节节胜利的面前，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结日益巩固的面前，在全世界人民日益觉醒为摆脱资本帝国主义枷锁而不断地进行英勇的斗争的面前，铁托们的修正主义者的企图，完全是徒劳的。伟大的列宁主义万岁！①“马克思关于巴黎公社的一次演说”②“新民主主义论”③铁托1959年12月12日在萨格勒布的讲话④“打着别人的旗帜”⑤“第二国际的破产”⑥“打着别人的旗帜”⑦铁托1959年12月12日在萨格勒布的讲话⑧“关于全俄中央执行委员会和人民委员会的工作”⑨“无产阶级革命的军事纲领”⑩“我国国内外形势和党的任务”?“答美国‘纽约晚报’记者问”?见南斯拉夫“人民军报”1958年11月28日“积极共处和社会主义”一文?见南斯拉夫“战斗报”1959年12月4日“艾森豪威尔到达罗马”一文?“莫斯科工会和工厂委员会第四次代表会议”?见伯恩斯坦的“经济生活的各种形式”一文?“共产国际第一次代表大会”?“在勃列斯尼亚区工人代表会议上的演说”?“社会民主党在民主革命中的两种策略”?“预言”?“全俄社会教育第一次代表大会”?“给欧美工人的信”?“革命的任务”?“论口号”?“军队与革命”?“国家与革命”?“无产阶级革命和叛徒考茨基”?“第三国际及其在历史上的地位”?“在俄共（布）莫斯科组织积极分子大会上的演说”?“立宪会议选举和无产阶级专政”?“上海太原失陷以后抗日战争的形势和任务”?“‘共产党宣言’1890年德文版序”
