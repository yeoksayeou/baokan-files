Xinhua News Agency, April 26th, Tunis: Algerian Republic Prime Minister Abbas strongly condemned the imperialist countries, led by the United States, for continuing to support France in its colonial war in Algeria on the 25th in Tunis. He said that the West bears a major responsibility for the prolongation of the Algerian war.

In a statement to "El Moudjahid," the organ of the Algerian National Liberation Front, Abbas pointed out that Western countries are supporting French imperialism in its inhuman war of extermination in Algeria, both morally and materially. He said, "France's war budget is supported by loans from the United States and Germany (West Germany). This is something that surprises our people and should surprise the whole world."

He also pointed out that many French divisions, equipped by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, are fighting in Algeria.

After ridiculing the shameful conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to prevent Algeria from accepting foreign aid and to isolate it, Abbas said, "The Algerian revolution relies on its own manpower and material resources," but "the Algerian government will extend a hand of friendship to all peoples who support its struggle."

Referring to de Gaulle's war cry in March that "Algerian policy is based on achieving military victory," Abbas once again condemned the French government for refusing to achieve peace in Algeria. He said, "De Gaulle leaves us no choice but to prepare for a long war. Our people should understand this, and our task is to prepare for this war. We can be sure that we will win in the war."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 28th: The Supreme Command of the Algerian National Liberation Army issued a military communiqué here today stating that from April 21st to 24th, the Algerian National Liberation Army launched attacks throughout Algeria, causing significant losses to French troops and military installations. The communiqué said that during this period, the Algerian National Liberation Army ambushed French military convoys seventeen times, engaged French troops nineteen times, and launched attacks on twenty-nine French strongholds. At the same time, Algerian forces carried out thirty-three sabotage operations against French fortifications and radio communications equipment throughout Algeria.

The communiqué went on to say that in the fighting, Algerian nationalists killed a total of 546 French troops, wounded 235, and another seven enemy soldiers surrendered to the Algerian National Liberation Army with all their equipment.

The communiqué said that Algerian nationalists also destroyed 63 French armored vehicles and tanks, shot down two French military aircraft and helicopters, destroyed two trains, and seized 431 weapons and a large quantity of ammunition. (Attached photo)

    新华社26日讯　突尼斯消息：阿尔及利亚共和国总理阿巴斯25日在突尼斯强烈谴责以美国为首的帝国主义国家继续支持法国在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争。他说，阿尔及利亚战争的延长要由西方负重大责任。
    阿巴斯在向阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线机关报“圣战者报”发表谈话时指出，西方国家不但在精神上而且在物质上支持法帝国主义在阿尔及利亚进行绝灭人性的战争。他说，“法国的战争预算是由美国和德国（西德）的贷款支持的。这是使我国人民感到惊讶和应当使全世界感到惊讶的事”。
    他还指出，由北大西洋公约组织装备起来的许多法国师正在阿尔及利亚作战。
  阿巴斯在嘲笑了美帝国主义妄图阻止阿尔及利亚接受外国援助、使它陷于孤立的可耻的阴谋之后说，“阿尔及利亚的革命依靠它自己的人力和物力”，但是，“阿尔及利亚政府将向所有支持它的斗争的人民伸出友谊之手。”
    阿巴斯在谈到戴高乐3月间发出所谓“阿尔及利亚政策以取得军事胜利为基础”的战争叫嚣时，再一次谴责法国政府拒绝在阿尔及利亚实现和平。他说，“戴高乐使我们没有其他选择，而只有准备一场长期战争。我们人民应该了解这一点，我们的任务就是准备这场战争。我们可以肯定，我们一定会在战争中取得胜利。”
    新华社开罗28日电　阿尔及利亚民族解放军最高司令部今天在这里发表的一项军事公报说，在4月21日到24日期间，阿尔及利亚民族解放军向阿尔及利亚各地出击，使法国军队和军事设施遭到重大损失。公报说，在这期间，阿尔及利亚民族解放军对法国军事运输队进行了十七次伏击，同法军交战了十九次，并且向二十九个法军据点发动了攻击。同时，阿尔及利亚部队还对法军在阿尔及利亚各地的工事和无线电通讯设备进行了三十三次破坏活动。
    公报接着说，在战斗中，阿尔及利亚民族主义者共击毙法军五百四十六人，击伤二百三十五人，另有七名敌军带着全部装备向阿尔及利亚民族解放军投诚。
    公报说，阿尔及利亚民族主义者还击毁法军装甲车和坦克六十三辆，击落法军军用飞机和直升飞机各两架，炸毁火车两列，缴获武器四百三十一件以及大量弹药。（附图片）
