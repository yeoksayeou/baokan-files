In 1959, China's sugar production achieved a bumper harvest, with total sugarcane production increasing by 3% compared to 1958, and beet production increasing by 27%. However, from the perspective of national needs, sugar production is still far from meeting the needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives. Therefore, we must have even greater development in sugar production this year.

Sugar is an important non-staple food in people's lives, and it is also an indispensable raw material for the food, medicine, and chemical industries. It has special significance for promoting the health of children and patients. In addition to producing sugar, sugar crops can also provide a large number of useful by-products. If all the by-products of sugarcane produced in 1959 (bagasse, molasses, filter mud) were comprehensively utilized, according to rough estimates, it could increase the country's output value by about 700 million yuan in products such as paper, alcohol, furfural, and cane wax.

The main key to completing this year's sugar production task is to ensure the completion of the sown area of sugar crops and vigorously improve the yield per unit area. At present, sugarcane has been basically planted, and areas with suitable conditions should try to plant more as much as possible. The beet sowing season is coming soon, and we must ensure the completion of the sowing area plan. In particular, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Jilin and other provinces and regions, which are the main sugar crop producing areas, should ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the planting plan. The situation for developing sugar production this year is very good. The cultivated land area in many areas has been expanded, and leaders in various places have grasped sugar production early and tightly. Under such favorable conditions, as long as we can comprehensively arrange production, we are confident in completing the national plan.

After the sugar crops are sown, we must immediately focus on field management during the seedling stage and comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Sugarcane should immediately launch a field management campaign centered on checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, and topdressing, to ensure that seedlings are complete and strong. Fields with insufficient base fertilizer should seize the early application of fertilizer to make the base of the stems thick and avoid lodging. Winter-planted sugarcane will soon enter the tillering stage, and more fertilizer should be applied to strive for more effective tillers. Beet should vigorously implement "early sowing, early thinning," to achieve complete, uniform, and strong seedlings. In areas where new beet varieties are planted and the technology is not fully mastered, technical forces should be trained through on-site visits, short-term training, inviting in, and sending out. As long as we ensure the sown area and focus on field management, we will definitely be able to realize a great leap forward in sugar production this year.

### 多种糖料作物

    多种糖料作物
    1959年我国糖料生产获得了丰收，甘蔗总产量比1958年增产3％，甜菜增产27％；但从全国需要来看，糖料生产还远远不能满足工农业生产和人民生活的需要。因此，我们今年糖料生产还必须有一个更大的发展。
    食糖是人民生活中的重要副食品，也是食品、医药、化学工业不能缺少的原料，对于促进儿童和病人的身体健壮更有特殊意义。糖料作物除生产食糖外，还能提供大量有用的副产品。如果将1959年所产甘蔗的副产品（甘蔗渣、废蜜、滤泥）全部加以综合利用，据粗略估算，可以为国家增加产值约七亿元纸张、酒精、糠醛、蔗腊等产品。
    完成今年糖料生产任务的主要关键，是保证完成糖料作物播种面积和大力提高单位面积产量。目前甘蔗已基本种完，有条件的地区还应当尽可能争取多种些；甜菜播种季节马上到来，一定要确保完成播种面积计划。特别是糖料作物主要产区的广东、广西，福建、四川、黑龙江、内蒙古、吉林等省区，更要保证完成和超额完成种植计划。今年发展糖料生产形势好得很，不少地区耕地面积均有扩大，各地领导对糖料生产抓得早、抓得紧。在这样有利条件下，只要能够全面地安排生产，完成国家计划是有把握的。
    糖料作物播种以后，必须立即狠抓苗期田间管理，全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”。甘蔗要马上掀起一个以查苗补苗和追肥为中心的田间管理运动，保证苗全、苗壮。基肥不足的田更应抓紧早期施肥，使茎基部粗壮，避免倒伏。冬植甘蔗很快就要进入分蘖阶段，更要猛施肥料，争取更多的有效分蘖。甜菜要大力贯彻“早播种，早间苗”，做到苗全、苗匀、苗壮。新种甜菜的地区技术上没有完全过关，应该采取现场参观、短期训练、请进来、派出去等办法培训技术力量。只要我们保证播种面积，狠抓田间管理，我们就一定能够实现今年糖料生产的大跃进。
