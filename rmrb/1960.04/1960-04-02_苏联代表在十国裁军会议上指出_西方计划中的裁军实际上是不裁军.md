    Soviet Representative at the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference Points Out That the Western Plan for Disarmament Is Actually Not Disarmament
    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 31st: The Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee held a routine meeting today, presided over by the Canadian representative.
    The Polish People's Republic representative, Mr. Naszkowski, emphasized in his speech that the time has come to practically formulate a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament. He pointed out that drafting this treaty must first determine the basic principles that should serve as the foundation for a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament. Naszkowski then suggested discussing specific measures for each stage of a complete and thorough disarmament plan and related measures in terms of supervision. In this regard, the Polish representative criticized the attitude of the Western countries' delegations, especially the US delegation, towards the issue of disarmament, particularly their request for the Ten-Nation Committee to first begin formulating an international supervision system detached from any specific measures in the field of disarmament.
    The British representative, Mr. Ormsby-Gore, attempted to defend the Western countries' disarmament plan in his speech at the meeting.
    The head of the Soviet delegation, Mr. Zorin, revealed at today's meeting that some Western representatives were attempting to portray the adoption of their proposal to set the level of armed forces of the Soviet Union and the United States at 2.5 million each as a realistic disarmament measure. Zorin pointed out that this Western plan is equivalent to not reducing any troops in the first stage, because the Soviet Union has already decided to reduce its armed forces to 2.4 million and is implementing it. As for the United States, the number of 2.5 million is the current level of the US armed forces. Zorin also asked how Britain and France would contribute to the cause of disarmament in the first stage of the Western plan.
    Zorin then pointed out the urgent need to take decisive measures to completely prohibit nuclear weapons. He said that the Soviet government proposes to ban atomic weapons, destroy all atomic and hydrogen bombs possessed by all countries, and stop the production of these weapons in the future. The Soviet representative emphasized that the energy of fissionable materials should only be used for peaceful economic and scientific purposes.
    The head of the Soviet delegation pointed out that another important step in solving the task of completely banning nuclear weapons is for all countries to undertake the obligation not to be the first to use such weapons. This measure can be implemented even before the signing of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament.
    Zorin then pointed out that the Western countries' proposal to stop the production of military fissionable materials and to use a certain amount of the accumulated nuclear materials for peaceful purposes has no practical significance. He said that this measure cannot lead to the elimination of the danger of a nuclear war. Because after the implementation of this measure, nuclear weapons will still remain in the equipment of various countries. Moreover, stopping the production of fissionable materials for military purposes cannot produce any results from the perspective of stopping the atomic arms race, because countries will be able to use the large amount of fissionable materials that have already been accumulated in the warehouses of some countries to produce atomic and hydrogen bombs. The Soviet representative pointed out that if the above two measures are implemented separately from the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons and the destruction of its reserves, then it will not help reduce the danger of nuclear war.
    Zorin finally said that therefore, the measures proposed by the Western countries for the implementation of nuclear disarmament cannot solve the issue of banning nuclear weapons and cannot serve as the basis for the corresponding clauses on nuclear disarmament in the formulation of a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament. The Soviet proposals in this regard are fully in line with this task.

### 苏联代表在十国裁军会议上指出  西方计划中的裁军实际上是不裁军

    苏联代表在十国裁军会议上指出
    西方计划中的裁军实际上是不裁军
    据新华社1日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦31日讯：十国裁军委员会今天在加拿大代表主持下举行了例会。
    波兰人民共和国代表纳希科夫斯基在发言时强调指出，现在到了实际制订全面彻底裁军条约的时候了。他指出，起草这一条约必须先确定应当作为全面彻底裁军条约基础的基本原则。纳希科夫斯基接着建议讨论全面彻底裁军计划每一阶段的具体措施和在监督方面与此有关的措施。在这方面，波兰代表抨击西方国家代表团，首先是美国代表团对裁军问题的态度，特别是他们要求十国委员会首先着手制订脱离裁军方面任何具体措施的国际监督制度。
    英国代表奥姆斯比—戈尔在会议上发言时企图为西方国家的裁军计划辩护。
    苏联代表团团长佐林在今天举行的会议上揭露某些西方代表企图把事情描绘成这样：似乎采纳他们的关于规定苏、美两国武装部队水平各为二百五十万人的建议是一个现实的裁军措施。佐林指出，西方这一计划等于在第一阶段不裁减任何军队，因为苏联已经决定把武装部队裁减到二百四十万人，而且正在执行。至于美国，二百五十万人的数目就是目前美国武装部队的水平。佐林还问道，在西方计划的第一阶段中，英国和法国如何对裁军事业作出贡献呢？
    佐林接着指出有迫切必要采取坚决措施完全禁止核武器。他说，苏联政府建议禁止原子武器，销毁各国拥有的所有原子弹和氢弹，并且在今后停止生产这些武器。苏联代表着重指出，裂变物质的能量应当只被用于和平经济和科学目的。
    苏联代表团团长指出，解决完全禁止核武器的任务还有另一个重要步骤，这就是各国承担不最先使用这种武器的义务。这个措施可以早在签订关于全面彻底裁军条约前就付诸实施。
    佐林接着指出，西方国家提出停止生产军用裂变物质和关于把一定数量的所积存的核物质用于和平目的，没有任何现实意义。他说，这一措施不可能导致消除核战争爆发的危险。因为在执行这一措施之后，各国装备中将仍然保留有核武器。而且停止生产用于军事目的的裂变物质，从停止原子军备竞赛角度来看，不可能产生什么结果，因为，各国将有可能用某些国家的仓库中已经蓄积的大量的裂变物质来生产原子弹和氢弹。苏联代表指出，如果脱离禁止使用核武器和销毁它的储备来实现上述两个措施，那末将无助于减少核战争的危险。
    佐林最后说，因此，西方国家建议在核裁军方面实施的这些措施不能解决禁止核武器问题，不能成为制订全面彻底裁军条约中有关核裁军问题的相应条款的基础。苏联关于这方面的建议完全符合这个任务。
