Lenin was a revolutionary Marxist and a true collectivist. His entire life's activity was devoted to a great purpose—the struggle for the victory of socialism. This was embodied in his entire thinking and emotions. He did not have any of the pettiness, jealousy, resentment, vindictiveness, or vanity inherent in a small-property individualist.

Lenin waged struggles, raised issues sharply, but he never mixed personal matters into disputes. He always approached issues from the matter itself. Therefore, comrades generally did not feel uncomfortable because he raised issues sharply. He observed people very carefully, listened to others' conversations, and tried his best to grasp the essence of things. Therefore, he was good at seeing a person's character from many extremely small things, caring for people meticulously, and seeing all the good and valuable things in others that could serve the common cause.

We often found that some people became different after coming into contact with Ilyich, so comrades loved Ilyich. And Ilyich also absorbed from his interactions with comrades much more than others could. Learning from life and learning from others is not something anyone can do, but Ilyich was good at doing this. He did not play tricks on anyone, did not use diplomacy, did not deceive, and people felt he was sincere and frank.

Caring for comrades was his characteristic. Whether in prison or when he gained freedom, in exile or abroad, and during his time as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, he cared for his comrades. He not only cared for his comrades, but also for distant people who needed his help. The only letter from Ilyich that I have preserved contains these words: "People often write to you asking for your help. I read these letters and do my best to help." ① This was in the summer of 1919, when Ilyich had an overwhelming amount of things to deal with. The civil war was raging fiercely. In the same letter, he wrote: "It seems that Crimea has fallen into the hands of the White bandits again." ② Ilyich was extremely busy with his work, but I never heard him say that he did not have time to help others.

He often told me that I should be more concerned about comrades in my work. Once, during the purge, one of our staff members in the People's Commissariat of Education was attacked for no reason. He took the time to go through old documents, trying to find materials to prove that this staff member had supported the Bolsheviks even when he was a Bundist before the October Revolution.

Some people say that Lenin was a kind person. But the word "kind" comes from the old word "virtue," which is not enough to describe Ilyich; the word is a bit too light and not accurate enough.

Ilyich never had the fault of being stuck in a family and a small circle, which was characteristic of the old era. He never separated the individual from society; the individual and society were integrated into a whole in him. He would never love a woman who disagreed with him in terms of viewpoints and was not a comrade in work. He had great love for people; his feelings for Plekhanov, from whom he benefited greatly, were very typical. However, when he saw that Plekhanov was incorrect and his views were harmful to the cause, this feeling never prevented him from fighting Plekhanov with all his strength, nor did it prevent him from completely breaking with Plekhanov when Plekhanov became a Defensist.

Achievements in work made Ilyich exceptionally happy. Work was what he lived by, what he loved and was fascinated by. Lenin always tried to be close to the masses, and he was good at getting close to the masses. Interaction with workers taught him a lot and enabled him to truly understand the tasks of the proletariat's struggle at each stage. As long as you study Lenin as a scientific worker, propagandist, writer, editor, and organizer with your heart, you will understand Lenin's personality. From the thousands of opinions in his articles and speeches, and even certain words and expressions, it can be seen that Ilyich was a collectivist and a fighter for the workers' cause. Being a collectivist and a fighter for the workers' cause is the greatest happiness. He always felt that his vision was expanding, his understanding of life was deepening, his scope of activities was expanding, and his ability to work was constantly improving; he felt that he was growing with the growth of the masses and the development of the cause. Therefore, Ilyich laughed so infectiously, joked so happily, and loved the "evergreen tree of life" so much, and life gave him so much joy. If Lenin had lived in another era, rather than in the era of proletarian revolution and socialist construction, then he would not have been Lenin. Marxist theory made him deeply convinced that the proletarian cause would surely triumph, and gave him foresight. The struggle and work for the proletarian cause in particularly close proximity to the proletariat cultivated in Ilyich the qualities of the person of the future, whose face is very different from the face of aristocratic heroes, bourgeois heroes, and petty-bourgeois heroes who are far from the people.

To understand what kind of person Ilyich was, it is necessary to more deeply understand what socialist construction is, and to understand the face of people under the socialist system.

    列宁的为人
    〔苏联〕娜·康·克鲁普斯卡娅
    列宁是革命的马克思主义者和真正的集体主义者。他毕生的活动都服从于一个伟大的目的——为社会主义的胜利而奋斗。这一点体现在他的整个思想感情里。他没有任何一点小私有制个人主义者所固有的斤斤计较、嫉妒、愤恨、报复和虚荣心。
    列宁进行斗争，尖锐地提出问题，但是他从来不在争论中掺杂任何个人的东西，对待问题总是从事情本身出发，所以同志们一般都不因为他提问题尖锐而感到不痛快。他非常细心地观察人，倾听别人的谈话，尽力抓住事情的实质，所以他善于从许多极其细小的事情看到一个人的面貌，无微不至地关心人，看到别人的能为共同事业服务的一切好的宝贵的东西。
    我们常常发现，有些人由于和伊里奇接触而变成了另外一种人，所以同志们都喜爱伊里奇。而伊里奇在和同志们的交往中也吸取了他人很少能吸取到的那样多的东西。向生活学习，向别人学习，这不是任何人都能办到的，而伊里奇善于做到这一点。他对谁都不耍滑头，不使用外交手腕，不进行欺骗，人们觉得他是真诚、坦率的。
    关心同志是他的特点。无论是在狱中或在获得自由的时候，在流放中或在流亡国外的时候，以及在担任人民委员会主席期间，他都是关心同志的。他不仅关心同志，也关心需要他帮助的很疏远的人。我手里保存的伊里奇的唯一的一封信中有这样的话：“经常有人给你来信求你帮忙，我读了这些信，并竭尽我的力量去作”。①这是1919年夏天的事情，当时伊里奇要处理的事情多得不得了。内战激烈地进行着。在同一封信中他写道：“克里木好像又陷入白匪手里了”。②伊里奇的工作忙得不得了，但是我从来没有听他说过，他没有时间去帮助别人。
    他常常对我说，我应该在工作上更关心同志。有一次，在清党的时候，我们教育人民委员部的一个工作人员无缘无故地受到了攻击。他抽出时间翻阅旧文件，想找材料证明这个工作人员在十月革命前还是崩得分子时就是支持布尔什维克的。
    有些人说列宁是一个善良的人。但是“善良的”这个词是从德行这个旧词汇来的，不足以说明伊里奇，这个词有点不够分量，也不够准确。
    伊里奇从来就没有旧时代所特有的陷在家庭和小圈子中的故步自封的毛病。他从来不把个人和社会分开，个人和社会在他那里是融合成一个整体的。他永远不会爱一个在观点上和他有分歧、在工作上还不是同志的女人。他对人非常热爱，他对使他得益很多的普列汉诺夫的感情就是很典型的。但是，当他看到普列汉诺夫不正确，他的观点对事业有害的时候，这种感情从来没有妨碍他全力同普列汉诺夫进行斗争，当普列汉诺夫成为护国派分子的时候，这种感情也没有妨碍他和普列汉诺夫彻底决裂。
    工作有成绩，使伊里奇异常高兴。工作，这是他赖以生活的东西，是他所喜爱、所迷恋的东西。列宁总是尽量接近群众，而他也善于接近群众。同工人交往使他学到了很多东西，使他真正了解无产阶级在每个阶段的斗争任务。只要用心研究作为科学工作者、宣传家、作家、编辑、组织家的列宁，就会了解列宁的为人。从他的文章和演说中的几千条意见，甚至某些用语和说法，可以看出伊里奇这个人是一位集体主义者，是为工人事业奋斗的战士。做一个集体主义者和为工人事业奋斗的战士是最大的幸福。他随时都感觉到自己的眼界日益扩大，对生活的理解日益加深，活动范围日益扩大，工作能力不断提高；他感到自己随着群众的成长和事业的发展而成长起来。因此，伊里奇笑得那么富有感染力，那么愉快地开玩笑，那么热爱“生活的常青树”，生活给了他那么多的欢乐。如果列宁生活在别一个时代，而不是生活在无产阶级革命和社会主义建设的时代，那他就不成其为列宁了。马克思主义理论使他深信无产阶级事业必定胜利，使他高瞻远瞩。在特别接近无产阶级的情况下为无产阶级事业而进行的斗争和工作，在伊里奇身上培养了未来的人的品质，这种人的面貌同远离人民群众的贵族英雄、资产阶级和小资产阶级英雄的面貌是大不相同的。
    要了解伊里奇是怎样一个人，这就要更深刻地领会什么是社会主义建设，就要理解社会主义制度下的人的面貌。
