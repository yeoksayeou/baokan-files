Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 3rd -- In the first spring of the sixties, the ideological revolution, technological revolution, and production revolution movement on the Anshan Iron and Steel front swept through every corner of Anshan Iron and Steel with a surging momentum, thereby pushing steel production to a new stage of development with a higher speed. Anshan Iron and Steel's production in the first quarter of this year showed a new situation of a large-scale leap forward, breaking the old routine of slackness at the beginning of the year in the past years. The main products such as steel and steel products all completed the state plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota. Among them, steel exceeded by 0.53%, and steel products exceeded by 14.69%. The pig iron production plan of the Ironmaking Plant was also overfulfilled by 0.56%. The main products such as steel and pig iron from large blast furnaces have improved compared with the production level in the fourth quarter of last year. In particular, the production in March showed an unprecedented leap forward, with steel production increasing significantly every ten days, reaching a completely new level. The output of major products such as iron, steel, ore, and metallurgical coke has also increased significantly. For example, comparing the average daily output of the last seven days of March with the average daily output of the previous twenty-four days, steel increased by 17.7%, pig iron increased by 4.5%, steel billets increased by 6.1%, and coke increased by 2.6%. In this month, a large number of advanced technical and economic indicators also appeared in various factories and mines. The utilization coefficient of No. 9 blast furnace reached 2.468; the utilization coefficient of open hearth furnaces in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant reached 10.93, stepping into the world's advanced open hearth furnace ranks. The rolling capacity of many newly built rolling mills has increased several times compared with the original design capacity.

The fundamental reason for Anshan Iron and Steel's tremendous achievements in production is that under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of employees adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously promote mass movements, and adhere to the correct line of running industrial enterprises by the proletariat. Since the beginning of this year, a massive upsurge in studying Mao Zedong Thought has been set off throughout Anshan Iron and Steel, and a mass-based, conscious ideological revolution movement has emerged. After studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, the broad masses of employees have further broken down superstitions, emancipated their minds, established lofty aspirations, and revised this year's leap forward plan.

The technological innovation and technological revolution movement launched on the basis of the ideological revolution is even more magnificent in scale, more powerful in momentum, richer in content, and more significant in effect. At present, Anshan Iron and Steel, from the mining mountains to the ironmaking, steelmaking, and rolling systems, from the main production factories and mines to the auxiliary production units, from old factories to new factories, from manual production departments to mechanized and automated departments, from employees to odd-job personnel and their family members, are almost all involved in this movement, forming a hot and lively situation where everyone is innovating, everything is innovating, and everyone is catching up with each other. In the first quarter, Anshan Iron and Steel employees put forward more than 390,000 technical innovation proposals. After summarizing them, more than 110,000 were implemented, resulting in six automated production lines, eighty-six production linkage lines, one hundred and eighteen assembly lines, and two hundred and seventy-eight single-machine automation units. The company's level of mechanization has increased from 72% in January to 82.3%. In the movement, as soon as new technologies and new experiences appeared, they triggered a series of chain reactions, quickly forming a mass-based upsurge of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping. For example, as soon as the new steel rolling method of the primary rolling mill appeared, the employees vigorously made innovations and quickly achieved a major innovation in the entire process from steel rolling to hoisting. After the emergence of this new technology, it quickly developed from the primary rolling mill to many rolling mills, becoming the common property of each rolling mill. The communist spirit of mutual assistance and selfless cooperation has also been further promoted in this movement.

In order to achieve a large-scale leap forward in production, Anshan Iron and Steel also fully utilized their own created experience of technical performance competitions in the first quarter, and developed it into joint technical performance competitions, which is more suitable for the characteristics of joint enterprises. In the first quarter, Anshan Iron and Steel organized joint technical performance competitions many times, promoting production to reach a higher level wave after wave. In the joint technical performance competitions, each factory and mine promoted more than 6,000 advanced experiences, broke through 50,000 key production problems, and created 34,881 new production records, focusing on the weak links in production. The employees of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant vigorously promoted joint technical performance competitions focusing on increasing the charge, accelerating the refining, increasing the temperature, and extending the life of open hearth furnaces. They have now equipped fifteen sets of smelting operation experience and six sets of furnace maintenance experience, which has increased the charging amount of the plant's open hearth furnaces by more than double, and overfulfilled the plan every month.

Anshan Iron and Steel employees fully realize that the tremendous achievements made in the first quarter are only the beginning of a better and more comprehensive leap forward this year. Therefore, as early as mid-to-late March, they simultaneously focused on production and preparation, and made arrangements in terms of ideology, technology, equipment, raw materials, and other aspects as soon as possible to ensure a leap forward at a higher speed in the second quarter.

    思想大革命、技术大革命和生产大革命运动的伟大胜利
    鞍钢超额完成首季钢铁计划
    职工满怀信心，做好各种准备，争取二季度更大跃进
    据新华社鞍山3日电　在六十年代第一个春天里，鞍山钢铁战线上的思想大革命、技术大革命和生产大革命运动，以汹涌澎湃之势，席卷鞍钢每一角落，从而把钢铁生产推向一个新的、速度更高的发展阶段。鞍钢今年第一季度的生产，出现了大幅度跃进的新局面，打破了历年来年初松的旧常规，钢、钢材等主要产品都提前超额完成了国家计划。其中，钢超过0.53％，钢材超过14.69％。炼铁厂的生铁产量计划也超额0.56％完成。钢和大高炉的生铁等主要产品，都比去年第四季度的生产水平有了提高。尤其是3月份的生产，更出现了空前未有的突飞猛进的情况，钢产量一旬高过一旬，达到了一个全新的水平；铁、钢材、矿石、冶金焦炭等主要产品的产量也都显著提高。如以3月份最后七天的平均日产量与前二十四天的平均日产量比较，钢提高17.7％，生铁提高4.5％，钢坯提高6.1％，焦炭提高2.6％。在这个月里，各厂矿还出现了大批的先进技术经济指标。九号高炉利用系数达到二点四六八；第一炼钢厂平炉利用系数达到十点九三，跨上了世界平炉先进行列。许多新建轧钢厂的轧钢能力已比原设计能力翻了几番。
    鞍钢生产取得如此巨大成就的根本原因，是由于广大职工在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，坚持无产阶级办工业企业的正确路线。今年以来，全鞍钢掀起了一个声势浩大的学习毛泽东思想的热潮，出现了群众性自觉的思想大革命的运动。广大职工在学习毛泽东同志的著作以后，进一步破除了迷信，解放了思想，树立起雄心壮志，修订了今年的跃进计划。
    在思想大革命的基础上所展开的技术革新和技术革命运动，规模更加壮阔，声势更加浩大，内容更加丰富，效果更加显著。目前，鞍钢从矿山到炼铁、炼钢、轧钢系统，从主体生产厂矿到附属生产单位，从老厂到新厂，从手工生产部门到机械化自动化部门，从职工到勤杂人员以及职工家属，几乎全部卷入这一运动，形成了人人革新、事事革新、你追我赶的热气腾腾的局面。第一季度，鞍钢职工共提出技术革新建议三十九万多件，经过归纳以后，实现了十一万多件，出现了生产自动线六条，生产联动线八十六条，流水作业线一百一十八条，单机自动化二百七十八台。全公司机械化水平已由1月份的72％提高到82.3％。运动中，新技术、新经验一出现，就引起了一连串的连锁反应，迅速形成群众性的比、学、赶、帮的热潮。如初轧厂的新轧钢法一出现，职工们就奋起大闹革新，纷纷突破关键，很快实现了从轧钢到吊装全部工艺过程的大革新。这一新技术出现以后，又很快从初轧厂发展到许多轧钢厂，成为各轧钢厂共同的财产。助人为乐的共产主义大协作精神也在这一运动中得到进一步发扬。
    为实现生产大幅度的跃进，鞍钢在第一季度内还充分运用了他们自己创造的技术表演赛的经验，并把它发展到联合的技术表演赛，更加适合于联合企业的特点。在第一季度内，鞍钢多次组织联合技术表演赛，促使生产一浪高过一浪。各厂矿在联合技术表演赛中，针对生产薄弱环节，推广了六千多项先进经验，突破了五万个生产关键问题，创造生产新纪录三万四千八百八十一项。第一炼钢厂职工围绕平炉多装、快炼、高温、长寿，大搞联合技术表演赛，现已配成了十五套冶炼操作经验和六套维护炉体经验，使这个厂平炉装入量增加一倍以上，月月超额完成计划。
    鞍钢职工充分认识到：第一季度所取得的巨大成就，只是今年更好更全面跃进的开端。所以，早在3月中、下旬，他们就一手抓生产，一手抓准备，及早从思想、技术、设备、原材料等各方面作了安排，保证争取第二季度更高速度的跃进。
