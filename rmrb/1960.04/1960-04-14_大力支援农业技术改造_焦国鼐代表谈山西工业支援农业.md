Vigorously Support Agricultural Technological Transformation
Representative Jiao Guonai Talks About Shanxi's Industrial Support for Agriculture

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian.

Under the guidance of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, in order to accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture, Shanxi, like all parts of the country, is launching a mass movement to support agriculture on all fronts, including industry, transportation, commerce, finance, science, education, culture, health, and so on. Under the overall planning and strengthened leadership of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, all fronts and departments have formulated long-term or short-term plans to support agriculture, doing their utmost to provide support from multiple aspects, so as to accelerate agricultural development and promote the early realization of the Forty Articles of the National Program for Agricultural Development. This combination of leadership, planning, and organization with the high degree of consciousness of the broad masses has made supporting agriculture a vigorous revolutionary movement. The following mainly discusses the situation of industrial support for agriculture in our province.

Factory-county tie-ups, factory-commune tie-ups, technology going to the countryside

One of the main characteristics of Shanxi's industrial front's planned, large-scale support for agricultural technological transformation is the adoption of the form of factory-county tie-ups and factory-commune tie-ups. Large factories are tied to two counties each, medium-sized factories to one county each, and small factories and mines are tied two or three to a county, so that each county has a medium-sized machinery factory or a factory with a larger mechanical repair force to provide support. After the large and medium-sized factories are paired with the counties, they directly connect with two or three people's communes through the county to provide key support, assisting the communes in developing industry and diversified economies. On the other hand, they support the entire agricultural technological transformation by arming county-run industries. In this way, more than 1,700 county-run and above factories and mines in the province are tied to 66 counties and more than 900 people's communes, with an average of two factories supporting each commune. This is an extremely large force for promoting agricultural technological transformation.

Adopting the method of comprehensively arranging factory-county tie-ups and factory-commune tie-ups to support agricultural technological transformation on a large scale is a new feature of industrial support for agriculture as socialist construction enters a new stage. In the past, our province has always attached importance to industrial support for agriculture, and the supply of agricultural production materials has been increasing year by year. In 1958, the province took six cities as the center, divided up areas of responsibility, and had some large and medium-sized factories help counties develop industry, which greatly promoted the development of county-run industries. Many factories and people's communes also established cooperative relationships to support agricultural production and commune-run industries. Facts have proved that establishing cooperative relationships between factories and counties and factories and communes is an important method for tapping the potential of large factories and promoting the development of county and commune industries and agricultural technological transformation. However, in the past, we had not yet ensured that all large and medium-sized factories established connections with counties. Even for factories that had established cooperative relationships with counties and communes, due to the lack of long-term plans to support counties and communes, the support for county and commune industries and agriculture was not regular, systematic, and comprehensive enough.

In order to meet the requirements of agricultural technological transformation, we summarized our previous experience and planned to comprehensively organize factory-county tie-ups and factory-commune tie-ups, promoting the idea that all factory leading cadres and workers should be committed to serving agriculture for a long time. All factories and mines have formulated plans to support agriculture and county and commune industries. Therefore, in terms of the scale of support for agriculture, it has developed from a few factories and mines in the past to all factories and mines. In terms of the content of support, it not only supports current agricultural production but also actively arms county and commune industries; it not only provides material support but also cultivates technical forces for county and commune industries and agriculture. This has developed from the sporadic and sudden support in the past to planned, purposeful, comprehensive, and systematic support.

For example, the Yuci Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory and the Yuci Shuguang People's Commune, with the Party committee secretaries at the head, jointly organized a "Factory-Commune Agricultural Technological Transformation Cooperation Committee." Under the leadership of this committee, the commune established an agricultural technological transformation leading group and formulated a three-year agricultural technological transformation plan and a 1960 plan. The Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory also correspondingly established a support for agricultural technological transformation leading group and formulated a three-year plan and a 1960 plan to support the commune's agricultural technological transformation. This has turned the commune's agricultural technological transformation plan into a common goal for factory workers and commune members to strive for. The Shuguang People's Commune plans to build an agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair factory this year to undertake the repair and maintenance of large agricultural machinery such as tractors and the manufacturing of semi-mechanized farm tools. According to the plan, the workers of the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory will manufacture various mechanical equipment and tools to equip this factory and train technical workers for it. The commune wants to quickly realize the mechanization of service work and feeding work. The workers of the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory produced a batch of vegetable cutters and straw cutters and feed crushers. All departments of the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory also adopted the method of "corresponding line by line" according to the characteristics of their business to fully support the Shuguang People's Commune. For example, in addition to being responsible for treating seriously ill commune members sent by the commune, the hospital also trains medical personnel for the commune; the factory's finance section helps the commune's finance section improve the financial system; the factory's middle school opens classes for the children of commune members to study, and many children of commune members study in the middle school of the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory... This kind of factory-commune tie-up, planned support for agricultural technological transformation and commune-run industry, combined with the strategic and tactical blitz support organized by local Party committees when necessary, further enhances the strength of industrial support for agriculture. Things that could only be done late can be done early; things that could only be done on a small scale can be done on a large scale; things that could only be done slowly can be realized quickly. This is most obvious and prominent in the current drought resistance campaign. Many areas, based on the form of factory-commune tie-ups, unite several factories or dozens of factories to organize strategic and tactical blitz campaigns to build high-level irrigation projects, forcing river water up the high mountains at the fastest speed, turning thousands of acres of dry land into irrigated land in a few days. Taking Jiexiu County as an example, in mid-March, more than 30 factories and mines and 18 communes in the county cooperated to march towards the high-lying dry land. In just a few days, they transferred more than 300 units of electric motors, diesel engines, portable boilers, water pumps, transformers, and a large number of materials for stringing electric wires, and started the construction of 47 high-level irrigation projects, which can turn 287,000 mu of high-lying dry land into irrigated land. By March 27, 17 days later, 21 high-level irrigation stations had been built, turning 110,000 mu of high-lying dry land into irrigated land. Many commune members were so excited when they saw the river water flowing into the fields that they were moved to tears. They said: "In the past, it was difficult to get water on the high land, but now we have introduced water to irrigate the fields. It is because of the leadership of the Party and the support of the workers."

It is necessary to vigorously support counties and "poor communes" with weak foundations

When we comprehensively arrange factory-county tie-ups and factory-commune tie-ups, we pay special attention to supporting counties and poor communes with weak industrial foundations, using the strength of industrial support to enable poor communes to steadily catch up with rich communes. This is of great significance for rapidly changing the face of poor communes, promoting the comprehensive and balanced development of the rural economy, accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification, and accelerating the transition from basic team ownership to basic commune ownership, and then from basic commune ownership to ownership by the whole people. For example, the Ya'er Cliff People's Commune, located 70 li southwest of Datong City, is located in deep mountains and remote fields. Before liberation, grain production per mu was only about 30 jin. In recent years, all commune members have been determined to "uproot poverty" and work hard to change natural conditions. In 1957, the average grain production per mu in the commune reached 76.5 jin. After collectivization, in the struggle to "dig out the roots of poverty," the commune received active support from units such as the Silaogou Coal Mine around the commune. Because the commune has high mountains and many slopes, transporting fertilizer and carrying crops takes a lot of manpower and animal power. In addition to helping the commune promote overhead cable transportation, various coal mines also supported 25 small flatbed carts and more than 250 handcarts. The Silaogou Coal Mine helped the commune install an electric mill, saving more than 1,400 man-days and more than 2,800 animal-days throughout the year. The Wajinwan Coal Mine helped the commune build a high-level irrigation station, turning 120 mu of dry land into irrigated land. Thanks to the commune members' full efforts, practical work, hard work, and ingenuity, coupled with the support of various coal mines, the appearance of the commune is rapidly changing: now it has basically realized transportation by cart and grinding by power; the commune already has many small factories such as brick and tile factories, small coal kilns, and agricultural tool repair factories and vehicle repair factories; more than 750 of the more than 900 households use electric lighting; grain production per mu has reached more than 100 jin for two consecutive years. Last year, the average net income per commune member reached 88 yuan, catching up with the income level of commune members in general rich communes.

Factory workers vigorously support low-yield areas and poor communes to change their backward appearance, fully reflecting the communist style of the workers and masses of "helping when they see backwardness and taking on difficulties." Now, under the unified arrangement of the whole province and the organization and leadership of Party committees at all levels, the work of facing poor communes and providing key support is continuing to unfold in depth. Some coal mine workers have issued the bold statement of "no dry land around the coal mine," and they are determined to turn the high-lying dry land of nearby communes into irrigated land. Some factories have put forward the slogan "if the poor appearance is not changed for one day, the support will not be relaxed for one day." This communist ambition of the workers greatly encourages the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members to fight against nature.

After the factory-county and factory-commune tie-ups, the plans formulated by the factories to support agricultural technological transformation are implemented on the basis of ensuring the completion of the state plan. In order to accelerate agricultural technological transformation, a magnificent and unprecedented mass movement of everyone doing a few good things to support agriculture is unfolding on the industrial front throughout the province. The broad masses of workers are enthusiastic, unpretentious, and unconcerned about remuneration. They engage in voluntary labor in their spare time, contributing their wisdom and strength to support agriculture to the greatest extent possible. The most representative are the activities of Niu Sanlong and 15 other veteran workers from the Mechanical and Power Section of the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant. These 15 veteran workers automatically formed a "Mobile Repair Assault Team." Under the slogan of "call anytime, arrive anytime, find work on your own on Sundays if not called," they used their spare time to repair machines for farmers by combining on-site (rural) job hunting with on-call service, combining individual activities with collaborative activities, combining fixed support objects with extensive support, and combining activities in the factory with activities in the countryside. They often went to the countryside to find work on Sundays with tools, machine parts, materials (technical materials and propaganda materials), and dry food, and insisted on not eating commune members' food, not accepting gifts, not making conditions, and not caring about remuneration for their work in the countryside. From the beginning of last year to March of this year alone, they repaired, maintained, and installed 163 units (times) of various machines for three communes near the factory, made more than 2,500 various parts, and trained 30 technical workers for the countryside. Their noble communist style and communist work attitude are the excellent qualities that the broad masses of workers possess in supporting agricultural technological transformation. Recently, in response to the competition proposal of doing a few good things to support agriculture put forward by these 15 workers from the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant, workers throughout the province have formulated plans of action to support agriculture and immediately taken action. Some use Sundays to go to commune factories to teach technology; some establish relationships with commune irrigation and drainage stations to help commune members repair machines; some use their spare time to visit commune members to solicit work; some use waste and edge materials to manufacture small farm tools for commune members.... This mass movement of everyone doing good things to support agriculture, combined with the planned support of factory-county and factory-commune tie-ups, makes it possible for factories to realize their plans to support communes on a solid basis while ensuring the completion of the state plan.

Technology going to the countryside greatly accelerates agricultural technological transformation

The mass movement of industrial support for agriculture directly promotes agricultural technological innovation and technological revolution, and at the same time accelerates the great development of county and commune industries; and the great development of county and commune industries is promoting the development of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification from low to high. This mass movement, which reflects the new worker-peasant relationship, is a product of the soaring communist ideology. The in-depth development of the movement is causing a leap in the spiritual outlook of workers, peasants and the masses.

In order to realize the plan to support the Shuguang People's Commune, the workers of the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory have established a system of two hours of voluntary labor per week. In order to support the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, each management area of the Shuguang Commune has to expand the cultivated land by five mu and voluntarily labor to grow vegetables to support the factory. Helping each other in times of difficulty, giving way when it is convenient, uniting and helping each other, and taking the initiative to support each other have become the norm in factory-commune cooperation.

More than a dozen industrial enterprises around the Pingwang People's Commune in Datong City supported the Pingwang People's Commune in vigorously developing water conservancy and electrification. In order to allow workers from all over the country to eat vegetables from their hometowns, the commune conducted a survey among the workers, and then sent dozens of commune members to Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Harbin, Zhengzhou and other places to collect vegetable seeds and learn vegetable growing techniques. The variety of vegetables in 1959 increased from seven or eight to eighty-five. Workers from all over the country were deeply moved because they could "eat hometown vegetables outside the Great Wall." This noble communist style shown by factories and communes in mutual support is a manifestation of the broad masses of workers and commune members - especially the working masses - linking today's socialist construction with tomorrow's communist ideals. It is a manifestation of their building socialism with communist ideology. Their noble thoughts and styles will radiate more and more brilliantly in mutual support.

The mass movement of industrial support for agriculture is also promoting the further integration of industry and agriculture, workers and peasants. In the factory-commune pairing cooperation, large factories have become schools for training commune members, continuously cultivating talents in industry and other fields for the communes. Many communes have also established labor organizations that are both workers and peasants, participating in certain production labor in large factories, which gives more commune members the opportunity to receive the ideological education and technical training of the working class. In the factory-commune cooperation, the people's communes, with the comprehensive and systematic support of large-scale industry, vigorously develop commune industries; and large factories, with the support of the people's communes, vigorously develop non-staple food production. Some of the small factories established by the communes are directly serving the paired large factories. They supply raw materials to the large factories and process product parts for the large factories. The non-staple food production bases of large factories are closely linked to the diversified operations of the communes. In this way, agriculture develops within industry, and industry develops within agriculture. Industry and agriculture are intertwined, closely integrated, and promote each other, which has far-reaching significance for eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas and the differences between workers and peasants.

Now, the planned and large-scale support for agriculture from industry and other fronts in Shanxi Province is just the beginning. The development of this movement will enable us to complete the historical task of carrying out agricultural technological transformation ahead of schedule. We must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the red banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, learn from the advanced experiences of fraternal provinces and cities, and continuously summarize our own experiences, so that the mass movement to support agriculture will be carried out more widely, more deeply, and more persistently, accelerate agricultural technological transformation, and realize a better, more comprehensive, and sustained leap forward in the national economy.

    大力支援农业技术改造
    焦国鼐代表谈山西工业支援农业主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告。
    在党中央和毛主席提出的以农业为基础的方针指导下，为了加速农业技术改造，我们山西和全国各地一样，在工业、交通运输、商业、金融、科学、文教、卫生等各条战线上，正在开展着一个支援农业的群众运动。在中共山西省委全面规划、加强领导之下，各条战线、各个部门都制订出长期的或短期的支援农业的计划，尽最大的力量，从多方面进行支援，以加快农业的发展，促进农业发展纲要四十条的提前实现。这种有领导、有计划、有组织的支援和广大群众高度的自觉性相结合，就使支援农业形成一个轰轰烈烈的革命运动。以下我主要谈一谈我省工业支援农业的情况。厂县挂钩，厂社挂钩，技术下乡山西省工业战线有计划、大规模地支援农业技术改造，主要特点之一，是采取厂县挂钩厂社挂钩的形式，大型的工厂一厂对两个县，中型的工厂一厂对一个县，小型的厂矿两个或三个对一个县，使每个县都有一个中型机械厂或机械修理力量较大的工厂进行支援。大、中型工厂和县对口之后，它们又通过县和两个或者三个人民公社直接联系，进行重点支援，协助公社发展工业、发展多种经济等；另一方面，又通过武装县营工业，支援整个农业技术改造。这样，全省一千七百多个县营以上厂矿，和六十六个县、九百多个人民公社挂了钩，平均每个公社都有两个工厂进行支援。这是推进农业技术改造的一支极为巨大的力量。采取全面安排厂县挂钩、厂社挂钩的方法，大规模地支援农业技术改造，是社会主义建设进入新的阶段，工业支援农业的一个新特点。在过去，我省一向重视工业对农业的支援，供应的农业生产资料逐年都在增长，1958年，全省以六个城市为中心，分片包干，由一部分大、中型工厂帮助各县发展工业，大大促进了县营工业的发展，许多工厂和人民公社也建立了协作关系，支援了农业生产和社办工业。事实证明，建立厂县、厂社的协作关系，是挖掘大工厂潜力，推进县、社工业发展和农业技术改造的一个重要方法。但是，在过去我们还没有做到使所有的大、中型工厂都和县建立联系，就是和县、公社建立了协作关系的工厂，由于缺乏长期支援县、社的规划，对县、社工业和农业的支援，也不够经常、系统和全面。适应农业技术改造的要求，我们总结了以往的经验，有计划地全面组织厂县挂钩、厂社挂钩，促进所有工厂领导干部和广大职工坚定了长期为农业服务的思想，各厂矿都制订出支援农业和县、社工业的规划。因而在支援农业的规模上，由过去一部分厂矿，发展到所有的厂矿。在支援的内容上，是既支援当前农业生产，又积极武装县、社工业；既从物质方面支援，又为县、社工业和农业培养技术力量，这就由过去的零星突击的支援，发展到有计划、有目的、既全面又系统的支援。例如，榆次市经纬纺织机械厂和榆次市曙光人民公社两个单位，以党委书记为首，共同组织了一个“厂社农业技术改造协作委员会”。在这个委员会的领导下，公社成立了农业技术改造领导组，制订出农业技术改造三年规划和1960年计划。经纬纺织机械厂也相应地成立了支援农业技术改造领导组，制订出支援这个公社进行农业技术改造三年规划和1960年计划。这就把公社进行农业技术改造的规划，变成工厂职工和公社社员共同努力奋斗的目标。曙光人民公社今年要建立一座农业机械制造修配厂，来担负拖拉机等大型农业机械的修配，和半机械化的农具制造任务，经纬纺织机械厂职工，就根据规划制造各种机械设备和工具，把这个工厂装备起来，并为这个工厂培养技术工人。公社要很快实现服务工作和饲养工作机械化，经纬纺织机械厂职工就生产了一批切菜机和铡草机、饲料粉碎机，经纬纺织机械厂各部门也都根据自己业务的特点，采取“条条对口”的办法，全面支援曙光人民公社。如医院除了负责治疗公社送来的患重病的社员外，还为公社培养医务人才；工厂财务科帮助公社财务股健全财务制度；工厂的中学为社员子弟学习开班次，许多社员的子弟在经纬纺织机械厂的中学学习……这种厂社挂钩，有计划地支援农业技术改造和社办工业，与在必要的时候，由各地党委组织战役性的突击支援结合起来，就进一步增强了工业支援农业的力量。原来只能迟办的事情，就可以早办了；原来只能小干的事情，就能够大干特干了；原来只能慢慢来的事情，就能够快速实现了。这在当前的抗旱运动中，表现得最为明显和突出，许多地区以厂社挂钩的形式为基础，把几个厂或几十个厂联合起来，组织突击性的战役，建设高灌工程，以最快的速度把河水逼上高山，使成千成万亩的高垣旱地，几天之内变成了水地。以介休县为例，3月中旬，全县三十多个厂矿和十八个公社协作，向高垣旱地进军，短短的几天之内，就抽调出电动机、柴油机、锅驼机、水泵、变压器等共三百多台，和大批架电线的器材，动工兴建四十七项高灌工程，可使二十八万七千亩高垣旱地变成水地。到3月27日，十七天就建成了高灌站二十一座，使十一万亩高垣旱地变成了水地，许多社员看到河水流入田间，兴奋得心情激动，热泪盈眶，他们说：“过去高垣吃水难，如今引水来灌田，因为有了党领导，有了工人来支援”。
    要大力支援基础薄弱的县和“穷社”
    我们在全面安排厂县挂钩、厂社挂钩的时候，特别注意到对工业基础薄弱的县和穷社的支援，运用工业支援的力量，使穷社稳赶富社。这对迅速改变穷社的面貌，促进农村经济全面高涨和平衡发展，加速实现农业机械化、水利化、电气化，和加快从队基本所有过渡到社基本所有，再从社基本所有过渡到全民所有，都有重大作用。例如，大同市西南七十里的鸦儿崖人民公社，地处深山僻野，解放前，粮食亩产仅达三十斤左右。最近几年，全体社员决心“拔掉穷根”，努力改变自然条件，1957年，全社粮食亩产平均达到七十六斤半，公社化以后，社员们在“挖穷根”的斗争中，得到公社周围四老沟煤矿等单位的主动支援。公社由于山高坡多，运送肥料、搬运庄稼占用的人力畜力很多，各煤矿除帮助公社推广了高线运输外，还支援了小平车二十五辆，手推车二百五十多辆。四老沟煤矿帮助公社安装了一盘电动磨，全年节省人工一千四百多个，畜工两千八百多个。挖金湾煤矿帮助公社建立了一个高灌站，使一百二十亩旱地变成水地。由于公社社员鼓足干劲，实干、苦干、巧干，加上各煤矿的支援，公社面貌正在迅速变化着：现在基本上实现了运输车子化，碾磨动力化；公社已有砖瓦厂、小煤窑、农具修配厂、车辆修配厂等许多小型工厂；九百多户人家，有七百五十多户用电照明；粮食亩产量，连续两年都达到百斤以上。去年，每个社员纯收入平均达到八十八元，赶上一般富社社员的收入水平。工厂职工大力支援低产区和穷社改变落后面貌，充分体现了职工群众“见落后就帮、见困难就上”的共产主义风格。现在，在全省统一安排和各级党委的组织领导之下，面向穷社、重点支援的工作，正在继续深入地展开。有的煤矿职工发出“煤矿周围无旱田”的豪言壮语，他们决心使附近公社的高垣旱地变成水地。有的工厂提出“穷貌一日不改变，支援一日不松劲”的口号。职工们这种共产主义的雄伟气概，大大地鼓舞着广大社员向自然斗争的积极性。
    厂县、厂社挂钩之后，工厂制订的支援农业技术改造的规划，是在保证完成国家计划的基础上来实现的。为了加快农业技术改造，一个气势磅礴、规模空前的人人为支援农业办几件好事的群众运动，正在全省工业战线上展开。广大职工热情奔放，不讲条件，不计报酬，在业余时间从事义务劳动，为支援农业最大限度地贡献自己的智慧和力量。最有代表性的是长治钢铁厂机械动力室牛三龙等十五名老工人的活动。这十五名老工人自动组成“巡回检修突击组”，在“啥时叫，啥时到，星期日不叫自己找”的口号下，利用业余时间，采取上门（到农村）找活和随叫随到相结合，单独活动和协作活动相结合，固定支援对象和广泛支援相结合，在厂活动和下乡活动相结合的办法，为农民修理机器。他们经常在星期天带着工具、机器配件、资料（技术资料和宣传鼓动资料）和干粮，下乡找活干，并且坚持下乡工作不吃社员的饭、不收礼、不讲条件、不计报酬。仅从去年年初到今年3月份，他们就为工厂附近三个公社修配和安装了各种机器一百六十三台（次），配制了各种零件两千五百多件，还为农村培养了三十名技术工人。他们这种高尚的共产主义风格和共产主义的劳动态度，就是当前广大工人在支援农业技术改造中所具备的优良品质。最近，全省职工响应长治钢铁厂这十五名工人提出的人人为支援农业办几件好事的竞赛倡议，纷纷制订出支援农业的活动计划，并立即行动起来。有的利用星期天，到公社工厂传授技术；有的和公社排灌站建立关系，帮助社员修理机器；有的利用业余时间拜访社员，揽活干；有的利用废料、边料为社员制造小农具……。这个人人为支援农业办好事的群众运动，和厂县、厂社挂钩有计划的支援结合起来，就使各厂在保证完成国家计划的基础上，实现支援公社的规划更有了坚实的基础。
    技术下乡大大加快了农业技术改造
    工业支援农业的群众运动，直接促进了农业技术革新和技术革命，同时又加快了县社工业的大发展；而县社工业的大发展，又在推进着农业机械化、水利化、电气化由低到高的发展。这个反映着新的工农关系的群众运动，是共产主义思想高涨的产物，运动的深入发展，又使工农群众精神面貌在飞跃变化。经纬纺织机械厂职工，为了实现支援曙光人民公社的规划，每周义务劳动两小时，已形成制度。曙光公社为了支援经纬纺织机械厂，每个管理区要扩大耕地五亩，义务劳动种菜，支援工厂。见困难就帮、见方便就让、团结互助、主动支援，在厂社协作中已成风气。大同市平旺人民公社周围的十几个工业企业，支援了平旺人民公社大搞水利化和电气化，公社为了让来自祖国各地的工人能吃到自己家乡的菜，在工人中作了调查之后，派出几十个社员到上海、北京、南京、哈尔滨、郑州等地采集菜籽，学习种菜技术，1959年的蔬菜品种由七、八种增加到八十五种。来自祖国各地的工人，因为能在“塞外吃到家乡菜”而深受感动。工厂和公社在相互支援中所表现的这种高尚的共产主义风格，是广大职工和社员——特别是工人群众，把今天的社会主义建设和明天的共产主义理想联系起来的表现，是他们用共产主义思想来建设社会主义的表现，他们这种高尚的思想和风格，在相互支援中将放射出越来越灿烂的光彩。
    工业支援农业的群众运动，也在促进着工业和农业，工人和农民的进一步结合。在厂社对口协作中，大工厂成为训练社员的学校，为公社不断地培养工业和其它方面的人材。许多公社还建立了亦工亦农的劳动组织，在大工厂参加一定的生产劳动，这就使更多的社员有机会受到工人阶级的思想教育和技术训练。在厂社协作中，人民公社由于得到大工业全面、系统的支援，大办公社工业；大工厂在人民公社的支援下，大搞副食品生产。公社建立的小型工厂，有一些又是直接为对口的大工厂服务的，它们供应大工厂原材料，为大工厂加工产品零件。大工厂的副食品生产基地，又是和公社的多种经营紧密联系着。这样，工业内部发展着农业，农业内部发展着工业。工业、农业相互交错，紧密结合，相互促进，这对消除城乡差别、工农差别，具有深远的意义。
    现在，山西省工业和其它各条战线上有计划、大规模地支援农业，仅仅是开始。这个运动发展下去，将会使我们提早完成进行农业技术改造的历史任务。我们要高举毛泽东思想的红旗，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗，学习兄弟省、市的先进经验，不断地总结自己的经验，使支援农业的群众运动更加广泛、更加深入、持久地开展下去，加速农业技术改造，实现国民经济更好更全面地持续跃进。
