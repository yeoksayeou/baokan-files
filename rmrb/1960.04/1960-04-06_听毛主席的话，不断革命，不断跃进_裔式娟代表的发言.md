Speech by Representative Yi Shijuan

Presidium, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the draft state final accounts for 1959 and the draft state budget for 1960. In the nearly one year since the last National People's Congress, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's General Line, our great socialist construction has achieved great victories in continuing the Great Leap Forward. Our Shanghai State Cotton Mill No. 2 is the same. The total output value in 1959 continued to grow compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and it is estimated that the first quarter of this year will increase by 7.44% compared to the fourth quarter of 1959. In 1959, the factory successfully trial-produced and put into production 167 kinds of advanced products, and in January and February of this year, another 45 kinds were added. The precision Hongqi (Red Flag) Type III comber has been designed and manufactured ahead of schedule by the factory itself. The technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization is surging forward, rapidly changing the production technology of our factory. At present, 206 various indigenous and foreign machines that replace manual operation have been manufactured. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the factory has increased from 56% at the end of last year to more than 90%, and heavy manual labor has been completely replaced by mechanization and semi-mechanization. This has not only improved the working conditions of workers but also achieved "increased production without increasing personnel," laying a solid foundation for further improving labor productivity and realizing a better and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1960. Our group, like the entire factory, is also constantly leaping forward in ideology and production.

	Improving Operating Techniques to Adapt to High-Speed Production

In 1958, in order to resolutely implement the Party's General Line and adhere to high speed, our group continuously increased the speed of the spinning frames from 280 revolutions to 400 revolutions. At that time, some people felt that this was "violating scientific and technological theory" and would be dangerous. Especially in the early stage of acceleration, there were many thread breaks and low output, so these people said even more and doubted the high speed. At that time, we thought: the General Line requires high speed, and "old oxen" cannot enter socialism. Therefore, we showed our enthusiasm and increased the speed of the machines. At that time, we had only one idea: we could only start and not stop; no matter how great the difficulties, no matter how many thread breaks, we had to persevere. However, we were not sure how to overcome the difficulties and how to reduce thread breaks. Later, we studied Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" and discussed the problems in high-speed production at that time, which made us realize that the many thread breaks after high speed, from the perspective of our operating workers, were due to the fact that the original operating techniques could not be fully adapted, and the operating techniques could not keep up with high-speed production. This was the main contradiction. After this analysis, everyone felt enlightened. By summarizing experience and innovating operating techniques through diligent study and hard practice, we all learned and mastered the operating methods required for high speed. With the support of veteran workers and all parties, the 400-revolution speed was maintained, and output also increased rapidly. This made everyone realize even more that Chairman Mao's instructions are the truth, and they had more confidence in further overcoming production difficulties.

After the speed increased and the output increased, in the first half of 1959, we encountered the problem of how to further improve product quality. We were determined to achieve the Municipal Party Committee's instructions: a comprehensive harvest of high output, high quality, and economy. At that time, the main problem in product quality reflected in the operation was the many white spots in the joints. After analysis, we felt that there were many reasons, but we should first improve the joint operation. As a result of the research, it was found that the original method of twisting joints easily left white spots on the yarn, affecting the quality of the cotton yarn. Therefore, we focused our attention on solving the problem of jointing methods again. At the beginning, some people thought that this was a difficult contradiction to overcome, saying: "It is difficult to avoid white spots when the joints are made quickly." Is this the case? At that time, 300 skilled operators from cotton textile factories in the city proposed the initiative of "improving operating techniques to adapt to high-speed production," and they could all achieve good joint quality in high-speed production. Comrade Wang Guiying, a skilled operator and Communist Party member of our group, participated in the technical performance group organized by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and learned a lot of advanced experience all over the country. After returning, she worked hard and boldly created a picking joint operation method to replace the original twisting joint method, which not only adapted to high-speed production but also eliminated white spots. We launched a debate in the group by responding to the "300 Skilled Workers Initiative" and the advanced deeds of Wang Guiying, presenting the facts, and explaining the principles. Everyone's thinking was unified, and they had more confidence. Everyone mustered their energy, strived for the upper reaches, and set off a competitive upsurge of "learning from skilled workers and catching up with skilled workers." On the one hand, we worked hard to learn and master the picking joint method, and at the same time, we actively and comprehensively improved the level of operating skills. As a result of this diligent study and hard practice, we achieved comprehensive leap forward in speed, high output, good quality, and fewer defects. This fact made us further realize that adhering to high-speed production requires continuous innovation of operating techniques and improvement of technical levels in line with the needs of production development.

	More and More Enthusiasm, Faster and Faster Speed

Since the second half of 1959, inspired by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we have been fighting against right-leaning tendencies and encouraging enthusiasm. In order to achieve a better leap forward, everyone requested to further increase the speed of the machines. But some people have developed new superstitious ideas. They said: "The speed of 400 revolutions is already very fast, and it will be difficult to increase it further. Even if you want to speed it up, you have to do it slowly." We launched another debate. Many people said: "Can the speed of the car be accelerated slowly, can socialist construction also be carried out slowly? Now that the technical level has been improved, the speed of the car can be accelerated again." Because everyone has practiced their skills in the Great Leap Forward and is more confident and confident. After analysis and research and after making the necessary preparations, with the joint efforts of workers in relevant jobs, the speed of the car was increased from 400 revolutions to 450 revolutions. Because of the experience, the problem of too many thread breaks was quickly solved, and the level of operating technology was further improved. Unit output increased from 45 kilograms to 50.2 kilograms. 100% of product quality reached national standards, and 49% was superior yarn. We have once again realized how wise Chairman Mao's call for breaking superstitions and liberating the mind is. The speed of our team's car has been increased from 280 revolutions to 400 revolutions, and then to 450 revolutions, breaking all kinds of superstitions. It is because we resolutely followed Chairman Mao's instructions, broke superstitions, carried out scientific analysis, and took active measures that the speed of the car was increased and production was improved. This fact tells us that to implement the Party's General Line and adhere to high speed, we need to constantly break superstitions and constantly liberate our minds so as to ensure the continued leap forward in production. Recently, in the technical revolution movement focusing on mechanization and semi-mechanization, we have once again broken superstitions and liberated our minds. Not only have we innovated operating techniques, so that all comrades in the group have reached or exceeded the technical level required by the "300 Skilled Workers Initiative" of the city's cotton textile factories, but also, together with veteran maintenance workers and the first group in the same shift, we have also experimented and created cleaning tools such as automatic sweeping and automatic wiping boards, effectively improving production. Now, we are working with other groups in the entire workshop to study the automation of the entire cleaning tool; further improve the level of operating technology; and the doffers are actively studying and mastering the operating technology of using automatic and semi-automatic doffing machines. We must better use Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution to arm our minds, continuously innovate technology, continuously solve contradictions, and continuously leap forward.

	Learning from the Advanced and Helping the Backward, the Whole Factory Striving for the Upper Reaches

In the struggle to achieve high speed, we further realized that "one flower blooming alone is not spring, but a hundred flowers blooming is spring." Therefore, we learn when we see the advanced, and we help when we see the backward. After the National Congress of Heroes last year, we signed a "Three Sisters" contract with other comrades in the second shift to learn from each other, help each other, and improve technology. Within the group and between groups, we achieved: if one person has advanced skills, everyone will learn; if one person has difficulties, everyone will solve them; if one group has experience, everyone will exchange; if one group has difficulties, all groups will help. Since the end of last year, we have selected the best technicians in our group to perform operations in the spinning frame workers throughout the factory and exchange experiences, thereby helping the spinning frame workers improve their skills. For example, in the third spinning workshop in our factory, all of which spins high-count yarn, some people originally felt that high-count yarn was difficult to use the picking joint method. The skilled workers in our group went to perform on-site to help them quickly master the picking joint technology. Under the education of the Party, we "leave the difficulties to ourselves and give the convenience to others." In a group in the same shift as us, a spinning frame worker was not producing well and was always "collapsing"; the group did not want her. We took the initiative to propose to the leadership to transfer her to our group. With the enthusiastic care and help of all the comrades in the group, she transformed, made rapid progress in production, and was able to take the initiative to help others.

Under the leadership of the Party, the spinning frame workers and doffers in our entire factory learn from each other, help each other, study diligently and practice hard. In just a few months, the vast majority of them have reached or exceeded the technical level required by the city's "300 Skilled Workers Initiative," and have mastered the operating methods suitable for high-speed production, promoting the continued leap forward in the production of the entire factory. Now, the unit output of various cotton yarns converted in our entire factory has increased to more than 42 kilograms, reaching the advanced level in the city.

In order to adhere to high speed, while carrying out technological innovation in operation, we also actively responded to the Party's call to march toward culture. 100% of the young and middle-aged comrades in our group participated in cultural learning. Everyone arranged the time properly according to their specific circumstances and persisted in cultural learning. Now, we have eliminated illiteracy in our group. There are three people in high school, nine in junior high school, eleven in higher elementary school, and nine in lower elementary school. We must continue to work hard and are determined to have a great turnaround in culture and be the masters of culture.

Fellow representatives: From their own practice, all the comrades in our group have further realized the incomparable power of Mao Zedong Thought. We must continue to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, always listen to Chairman Mao, never be proud, never be complacent, continuously revolutionize, and continuously leap forward.

### 听毛主席的话，不断革命，不断跃进  裔式娟代表的发言

    听毛主席的话，不断革命，不断跃进
    裔式娟代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。自上次人代会以来将近一年的时间里，我国伟大的社会主义建设事业，在党和毛主席的正确领导下，在毛泽东思想、党的总路线的光辉照耀下，取得了继续大跃进的伟大胜利。我们上海国棉二厂也是这样。1959年的生产总值，比大跃进的1958年继续增长，今年第一季度预计，又将比1959年第四季度增长7.44％。1959年全厂试制成功和投入生产的高级品种有一百六十七种，今年1、2月份又增加了四十五种。精密的红旗牌三型精梳机，已由厂里自己设计并提前制造成功。以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革命运动，一浪高一浪，迅速改变着我厂的生产技术面貌。目前，代替手工操作的较为重大
  的各种土洋机器，已制成二百零六台。全厂机械化、半机械化程度从去年年底的56％提高到90％以上，重体力劳动已完全由机械化半机械化代替。这样，不但改善了工人的劳动条件，而且做到了“增产不增人”，为进一步提高劳动生产率，实现1960年更好更全面的大跃进打下了牢固的基础。我们小组与全厂一样，在思想上、生产上也不断跃进。
    提高操作技术，适应高速生产
    1958年，我们小组为了坚决贯彻执行党的总路线，坚持高速度，把细纱车速从二百八十转不断加快到四百转。当时有些人就感到这是
  “违反科学技术理论”，会发生危险，特别在加速初期，断头多，产量低，这些人的话就更多了，对高速度发生了怀疑。而那时我们想到：总路线就要高速度，“老黄牛”不能到社会主义。因之我们就拿出自己的干劲，把车速加上去了。当时我们只有一个想法：只许上马，不许下马，困难再大，断头再多，也要顶住。但是到底怎样战胜困难，怎样减少断头，心里也没底。后来，我们学习毛主席的矛盾论，联系到当时高速中的问题进行讨论，使我们认识到，高速后断头多，从我们操作工人来说，是由于原来的操作技术不能完全相适应，操作技术跟不上高速生产，这是主要矛盾。这样一分析，大家的心里就亮了，通过总结经验，革新操作技术、勤学苦练，我们大家学习和掌握了高速需要的操作法。在保全老师傅和各方面配合下，四百转的车速坚持了下来，产量也迅速增加。这一来，大家更加体会到毛主席的指示就是真理，对进一步克服生产上的困难，信心更足了。
    车速加快了，产量提高了，1959年上半年，我们又碰到了如何进一步提高产品质量的问题。我们决心要做到市委的指示：高产、优质、节约全面丰收。当时产品质量上的毛病，反映在操作上的主要问题是接头白点多。我们一分析，觉得原因很多，但是应当首先改进接头操作。研究结果，发现用原来的拈接头操作方法，容易在纱上留下白点，影响了棉纱质量。因此我们又把注意力集中到解决接头法的问题上。开始，有一部分人认为这是难于克服的矛盾，说：“头接得快，白点是难避免的”。事实是不是这样呢？当时全市棉纺织厂的三百个操作能手，提出了“提高操作技术、适应高速生产”的倡议，他们都能做到高速生产中接头质量好。我们小组的操作能手共产党员王桂英同志，参加了共青团中央组织的技术表演团，到全国各地学习了不少先进经验，回来以后刻苦钻研，大胆创造，用挑接头操作方法代替原来的拈接头法，既适应高速生产，又消灭了白点。我们就通过响应“三百能手倡议”及王桂英的先进事迹，在小组里展开辩论，摆事实，讲道理，大家的思想一致了，信心更足了。大家鼓足干劲，力争上游，掀起了“学能手，赶能手”的竞赛热潮。一方面，努力学习和掌握挑接头法，同时，积极全面提高操作技术水平。这样勤学苦练的结果，做到了车速快、产量高、质量好、白花少，取得了多快好省的全面跃进。这一事实，使我们进一步认识到，坚持高速生产，就必须随着生产发展的需要，不断革新操作技术提高技术水平。
    干劲一鼓再鼓，车速一快再快
    1959年下半年以来，在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，反右倾、鼓干劲，为了实现更好的跃进，大家要求进一步加快车速。但有些人又产生了新的迷信思想，他们说：“四百转的车速已经很快了，再加就有困难，即使要加快也要慢慢来”。我们又展开了辩论。许多人说：“车速加快慢慢来，难道社会主义建设也能慢慢来吗？现在技术水平提高了，车速可以再加快”。由于大家在大跃进中练了本领，信心更足，心里也有底了。在进行了分析研究，和做了应有的准备工作以后，在有关工种工人的共同努力下，把车速从四百转加快到四百五十转。由于有了经验，断头多的毛病，也很快就解决了，操作技术水平又得到了进一步的提高。单位产量从四十五公斤，提到五十点二公斤。产品质量百分之百的达到国家标准，而且有49％是优级纱。我们又一次体会到，毛主席关于破除迷信、解放思想的号召，是多么英明。我们小组的车速从二百八十转加到四百转，再加到四百五十转，破除了种种迷信。就是因为我们坚决遵照了毛主席的指示，破除迷信，又进行科学分析，采取了积极的措施，车速就加上去了，生产就提高了。这个事实告诉我们，要贯彻执行党的总路线，坚持高速度，就需要不断破除迷信，不断解放思想，从而才能保证生产继续跃进。最近，在大搞以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革命运动中，我们又一次地破除迷信，解放思想，不但革新操作技术，使小组同志全部达到或超过了全市棉纺织厂“三百能手倡议”所要求的技术水平，而且与保全老师傅及同班第一组一起还试验和创造了自动扫地、自动打擦板等清洁工具，有效地提高了生产。现在，我们正在与全车间里其他小组一起研究整个清洁工具的自动化；进一步提高操作技术水平；落纱工人正在积极研究和掌握使用自动、半自动落纱机的操作技术。我们一定要更好地用毛主席的不断革命思想，武装自己的头脑，不断革新技术，不断解决矛盾，不断跃进。
    学先进帮后进，全厂齐争上游
    在实现高速度的斗争中，我们进一步体会到“一花独放不是春，万紫千红才是春”。因此，我们见先进就学，见后进就帮。去年全国群英大会以后，我们就和其他二班同志签订了“三姊妹”合同，互相学习，互相帮助，提高技术，在小组内，以及各小组之间，做到了：一人有先进，大家去学习；一人有困难，大家去解决；一组有经验，大家来交流；一组有困难，组组来帮助。去年年底以来，我们把自己小组里最好的技术能手抽出来，在全厂细纱挡车工中进行操作表演，交流经验，从而帮助了细纱挡车工提高了技术。像我们厂里的三纺车间，都是纺的高支纱，原来有一部分人感到高支纱用挑接法有困难，我们小组里的能手就去进行现场表演，帮助她们很快掌握了挑接头技术。在党的教育下，我们“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”。我们同班的一个组里，有个细纱挡车工生产不好，老是“坍”；小组里不要她。我们就主动向领导上提出，把她调到了我们小组里，在全组同志热情地关心和帮助下，她转变了，生产上进步快，而且还能主动地帮助别人。
    我们全厂的细纱挡车工，落纱工，在党的领导下，互相学习，互相帮助，勤学苦练，在短短几个月内，极大部分人达到或超过了全市“三百能手倡议”所要求的技术水平，掌握了适应高速生产的操作法，促进了全厂的生产继续跃进。现在，我们全厂各种棉纱折合的单位产量已提高到四十二公斤以上，达到了全市先进水平。
    我们为了坚持高速度，在进行操作技术革新的同时，还积极响应党的号召，向文化进军。我们小组里青壮年同志百分之百的参加了文化学习。大家根据自己的具体情况，妥善安排了时间坚持文化学习。现在，我们组里消灭了文盲，读高中的有三人，读初中的有九人，读高小的十一人，读初小的九人。我们一定要继续努力，决心来一个文化上的大翻身，做文化的主人。
    各位代表：我们小组里的全体同志，从自己的实践中，更加体会到毛泽东思想的无比威力，我们一定继续高举毛泽东思想的红旗，永远听毛主席的话，永远不骄傲，不自满，不断革命，不断跃进。
