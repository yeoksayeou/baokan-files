Comrades of the Presidium, Fellow Delegates:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, and I firmly implement them.

I am a family member of an employee of the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant in Shenyang City. Now, I will only make a speech on how our factory organizes the production of employees' families and runs collective living welfare and service undertakings.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: "At present, cities across the country are vigorously running people's communes, street industries, suburban agriculture, public welfare undertakings, and public canteens, extensively organizing the economic life of residents, further organizing the urban people, and liberating tens of thousands of urban housewives from housework to participate in social labor. All of this is not only conducive to the development of production and construction but also conducive to the thorough transformation of urban social life." From our work experience, this is very practical. Under the direct leadership of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, our factory began preparing for the establishment of a people's commune in November 1958, named the Shenyang Qianjin People's Commune. After a year of consolidation and development in 1959, it fully demonstrated its strong vitality and unparalleled superiority, playing an active role in completing and overfulfilling our factory's various production plans. After the establishment of the commune, 80% of the factory's employees' families participated in social labor, of which 73% participated in state-owned factories as contract workers, and 27% participated in community-run industries. Over the past year, under the cultivation and education of the Party, they have generally improved their political awareness and cultural and technical levels. Now, 90% of the contract workers have reached the technical level of Grade 2 and 3 workers, can independently operate, and complete and overfulfill tasks. Many contract workers can work as lathe operators, grinders, electricians, and pressure workers, and also as carpenters, bricklayers, and inspectors, becoming all-rounders. They have not only become skilled workers but also many have become technical innovation experts and backbones on the production front. For example, Workshop 301 encountered difficulties in cleaning sand during the big leap in August and September 1959 to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, which affected the completion of production tasks. At that time, the situation was that there were few people, heavy tasks, and tight schedules. Under the leadership of Wang Xiulan, a female contract worker among the employees' families, fifteen women voluntarily formed the Mulan Brigade. Everyone came up with ideas and used their brains, proposing seventy-one suggestions, and launched a sister red flag competition of "two tops, three skills," which increased production efficiency by one to ten times, thereby breaking through the key to cleaning sand and completing the task three days ahead of schedule, ensuring that the Third Production Zone completed the production task of the third quarter of 1959 seven days ahead of schedule.

In addition to organizing employees' families to participate in the production of our factory, we also enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and organized a large number of employees' families to actively participate in the movement to run community-run industries. All employees' families were full of energy and carried forward the communist style of daring to think and dare to act. At that time, everyone did not understand technology, had no equipment, and had no production channels, and there were many difficulties. However, under the leadership of the Party, these difficulties were overcome one by one. Without equipment, we mobilized the women to find waste materials everywhere. In just one month, we dug up more than 700,000 bricks, 120,000 jin of wood, 223 tons of steel, 11 tons of hardware, and 1,000 tons of refractory bricks, which laid a material foundation for our industry. Without understanding technology, we launched a campaign among employees' families to "learn technology from their relatives." The learning conditions were very favorable. Among the employees' families, some husbands were engineers and technicians, and some were skilled workers. In particular, after the Party committee put forward the slogan that each employee should do a good deed in the process of employees' families running industries, a upsurge of mutual teaching and mutual learning and vigorously running industries quickly swept across the factory. Under the leadership of the Party committee and with the strong support of all employees, after three months of hard work, overcoming numerous difficulties, we finally established eleven small, indigenous and foreign-combined factories serving the large factory, such as hardware, casting, cement, and wire nails. After rectification, there are currently still nine. From January to now, 364 innovation projects have been realized, 540 rationalization proposals have been put forward, 505 have been realized, labor productivity has increased by 1.25 times, and a value of 43,140 yuan has been created. Because these community-run industries directly process for the factory, the factory saved more than 300,000 yuan of wealth in 1959 and created 1.86 million yuan of wealth for the country, strongly supporting the production of our factory. Our factory, like all brother factories across the country, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the shining of the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, and with the joint efforts of all employees, completed the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan three years, one month, and five days ahead of schedule, completed the total output value plan for 1959 twenty-seven days ahead of schedule, and comprehensively and overfulfilled the annual national plan sixteen days ahead of schedule. This year, it completed the total output value plan for the first quarter eleven and a half days ahead of schedule, achieving a good start in the first season of the 1960s.

In order to better meet the needs of the ever-increasing living standards of employees, under the Party's call to vigorously develop the self-sufficiency movement for the production of non-staple foods in factories, we also mobilized employees and their families to vigorously run farms on the wasteland around the factory, raising 550 pigs and 5,500 chickens and ducks, producing more than 240,000 jin of milk and 3.8 million jin of vegetables annually, realizing self-sufficiency in non-staple foods for public canteens. And relying on the voluntary labor of all employees and their families, in the winter of 1959, a 30,000-square-meter fish pond with an annual output of 500,000 jin of fish was built. In addition, while carrying out collective breeding and public farms, we also called on each family to grow vegetables and raise chickens themselves. In 1959, 1.2 million jin of vegetables were produced and more than 5,000 poultry were raised, improving the lives of employees and boosting their production enthusiasm.

In order to enable employees' families to go to various labor positions for socialist construction without worry, and to provide factories and enterprises with a reliable "logistics department," according to the Party's directive of "grasping production with one hand and life with the other," we also vigorously developed collective living welfare and social service undertakings. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, comprehensive planning, adhering to the principle of self-reliance, making do with whatever is available, starting from scratch, spending less money, and doing more things, we vigorously developed nurseries, kindergartens, public canteens, and various forms of service-oriented collective welfare undertakings. A total of 57 nurseries (stations) and kindergartens have been established, with more than 2,400 children enrolled (excluding 15 factory-run ones). They were all built using local methods without asking the state for a penny or building a house. The houses were vacated by everyone, and the equipment was taken out by the families themselves. The nannies were selected by the masses themselves. And they all serve different needs for different objects. Some serve the children of female employees and female workers in private factories; some are temporary service groups organized for female employees and family members who participate in social life in their spare time; some are for preschool children, educating them in "five loves" and "four educations." Now these organizations have been unprecedentedly consolidated and are developing rapidly. The nannies put forward the slogan "The nursery is like home, the aunt is like mother," and warmly nurture the children. Since the beginning of this year, technical innovations have been carried out, and more than ten kinds of appliances such as electric urine alarms and automatic milk changers have been developed. In order to cooperate with female employees on the night shift, the guards proposed: "When the child's mother goes to the night shift, the doors of the day and night care are not closed. It is too far to go home in the middle of the night, please stay in the breastfeeding station." This gave the female employees great convenience and was deeply praised by the employees. They successively received more than 1,200 letters of praise from the employees, encouraging each other, thus greatly promoting the production enthusiasm of the female employees. More than 650 female employees in the factory were rated as advanced producers and red flag bearers. In January and February of this year alone, more than 2,000 female employees put forward more than 3,100 innovation proposals in the technical revolution, which played a significant role in improving production efficiency.

While solving the problem of female employees taking care of their children, the problem of eating must also be solved at the same time. To this end, under the leadership of the Party committee, adhering to the principle of starting from scratch and self-reliance, seventeen small and medium-sized public canteens were established. Later, according to needs, they were merged into three modern large canteens, meeting the needs of all employees for meals. 90% of the canteen cooks are women who have been liberated from housework. After participating in canteen work, under the leadership and education of the Party, they improved their ideological awareness, quickly mastered the technology and independently carried out work, and achieved great results. It is worth mentioning that in the three good and five satisfaction canteen competitions, the cooks tried their best to study the fine work of coarse grains, diversify the recipes, and ensure that the employees eat well and spend less money. A total of 3,760 kinds of staple and non-staple foods were made throughout the year. The employees wrote poems praising the public canteen: "Eat three meals a day, every meal has a variety of patterns, fragrant and delicious, everyone likes it, eat enough to add energy, set off a new upsurge, and production will increase greatly." Recently, encouraged by the Party's great call to march towards mechanization and automation, the canteen cooks have been in high spirits and full of energy. They have cooperated with the production workshops to carry out the mechanization of cooking utensils, realizing four automatic production lines for washing dishes, cutting vegetables, washing rice, and making dumplings, and thirty-six kinds of mechanized and automated cooking utensils, liberating the cooks from heavy physical labor. Their spirits are more uplifted, and they are working harder for the leap forward of the canteen work.

Our factory now has 80% of the employees' families participating in social labor, but some trivial matters in housework still involve their energy. They urgently demand to quickly get rid of the complicated housework burden in order to better engage in social labor and study. According to this situation, in order to better ensure the continued leap forward in production, according to the Party's instructions, our factory has also carried out comprehensive organization of the economic life of employees' families and vigorously developed service undertakings. Over the past year, from small to large, from decentralized to centralized, without asking the state for money, a total of 14 service stations, 19 consignment points, 196 neighborhood mutual aid groups, 3 barbershops, and more than 10 sewing groups have been established. These service undertakings run by the masses serve the lives of employees from buying rice and vegetables to sewing and mending. In 1959, a total of 643 maternity patients were assisted 2,550 times. This solved a big problem and gave great convenience to the employees, especially the employees whose couples both work, so that they can work in production with peace of mind.

The participation of the vast number of employees' families in production and collective activities has liberated women from tedious housework and socialized and collectivized housework, further improving women's ideological awareness. After more than a year of social labor and collective life exercises, a new atmosphere has emerged in which everyone talks about production, everyone talks about politics, cares about the country, takes care of the collective, gives convenience to others, and leaves difficulties to themselves, and a comradeship-style equal and loving relationship and a democratic and united family have been generally established.

Over the past year, our experience in organizing housewives to participate in social labor and extensively organizing the economic life of residents is:

First, we must adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, listen to the Party's words, master the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, and understand the great significance of doing this work well for the current socialist construction in ideology. It is precisely because of the Party's political and ideological education that the vast number of employees' families have recognized the current favorable situation, improved their understanding, overcome the private ownership concept and narrow conservative consciousness left over for thousands of years, thoroughly eliminated the traditional remnants of the feudal patriarchal system and male chauvinism, mobilized the enthusiasm of the vast number of women, and organized them to participate in social labor and collective life. Organizing social labor and participating in collective life must implement the Party's policy of serving production and serving the workers and masses. In order to implement the Party's policy, every work must pay attention to centering around the Party's central task, and try every means to work hard for the Party's central task. Separated from the Party's central task, we can't do anything well. Obeying the leadership of the Party and listening to the Party's words is the most fundamental source of success in all our undertakings.

Second, mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and vigorously carrying out mass movements are the fundamental lines of all our work. The people are the creators of history. Socialist revolution and socialist construction are the conscious undertakings of thousands of millions of people. Without giving play to everyone's initiative and strength, we cannot do all undertakings well, and there can be no vigorous socialist construction. Organizing employees' families to participate in social labor, participate in collective life, and do a good job in the collective welfare undertakings of employees and their families are no exception. Most of the employees' families in our factory came from feudal families. They suffered the deepest and most oppression in the old society. Over the past few years, under the education of the Party, they have improved their ideological awareness, and they all have a strong will and demand for complete liberation. In particular, the establishment of the people's commune, realizing the socialization of housework, has completely freed the vast number of women from the history of being oppressed and enslaved. They have become social producers in the true sense, and they have great potential power. Our task is to fully develop and mobilize their wisdom and strength to serve socialist construction. It is precisely through this work that, under the leadership of the Party, we have vigorously carried out mass movements and done the above many works.

Since liberation, our vast number of employees' families, under the care and education of the Party, have grown up in the warm embrace of the mother like a child who does not understand things. We deeply realize the greatness of the Party and the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought. Take myself as an example. In the past, I was a poor worker's family. After liberation, like the vast number of women, under the cultivation of the Party, we were liberated from housework and participated in production and lived a collective life like workers. Women use poetry to praise this happy life:

In the past, women could only do needlework,
Turning around the stove all day long;
Intending to participate in production,
No one takes care of the children.

Now turning around the machine, they can do everything,
Eating in the big canteen,
Sending the children to kindergarten;
Learning politics and studying culture,
Picking up a pen to write poems;
Thanks to the Party's good leadership,
Chairman Mao's kindness can't be said enough.

Our happiness today cannot be expressed in a thousand words or ten thousand words. Only by adding bricks and tiles to the building of socialist construction without regard to fame, fortune, or remuneration, and advancing courageously with the people of the whole country in the direction pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao!

专栏：

    沈阳市前进人民公社在胜利前进
    高凤琴代表谈东北机器制造厂是怎样组织职工家属生产和举办集体福利事业的主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
    我是沈阳市东北机器制造厂的一个职工家属，现在仅就我厂组织职工家属生产和办集体生活福利、服务事业作一发言。
    李富春副总理的报告中指出：“现在，全国各城市正在大办人民公社，大办街道工业，大办郊区农业，大办公共福利事业，大办公共食堂，广泛地组织居民的经济生活，把城市人民进一步地组织起来，并且使成千成万的城市家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加社会劳动。这一切，不仅有利于生产建设的发展，而且有利于城市社会生活的彻底改造”。从我们工作中体会，这是非常切合实际的。我们厂在中共沈阳市委直接领导下，于1958年11月开始筹建人民公社，命名为沈阳市前进人民公社。经过1959年一年的巩固、发展，充分显示了它的强大生命力和无比的优越性，对完成和提前完成我厂各项生产计划起到了积极的促进作用。公社成立后，全厂职工家属有80％参加了社会劳动，其中参加国营工厂为合同工的占73％，参加社办工业的占27％。一年来，在党的培养教育下，她们普遍地提高了政治觉悟和文化技术水平。现在已有90％的合同工达到了二、三级工的技术水平，能够独立地进行操作，完成和超额完成任务，许多合同工既能当车工、磨工、电工、压力工，而且也会做木工、瓦工和检验工等十多个工种，成了多面手。她们不但成为了熟练工人，而且还有许多人成了生产战线上的技术革新能手和骨干。如三零一车间，在1959年大干8、9两月向建国十周年献礼过程中，遇到了清沙困难，影响生产任务的完成，当时情况是人员少，任务重，时间紧，在职工家属中的女合同工王秀兰同志带动下，十五名妇女自动组成了花木兰大队，人人想办法，个个动脑筋，提出了七十一项建议，开展了二顶三巧姊妹红旗竞赛，使生产效率提高了一至十倍，从而突破了清沙关键，提前三天完成了任务，保证了第三生产区提前七天完成1959年第三季度的生产任务。
    除组织职工家属参加我厂的生产外，我们还热烈地响应党的号召，组织了大批职工家属积极参加社办工业的运动。全体职工家属干劲十足，发扬了敢想、敢干的共产主义风格。当时大家都不懂技术、没有设备、又没有生产门路，困难很多。但是在党的领导下，这些困难都被我们一个一个地克服了。没有设备，我们就发动妇女群众到处去挖找废料。仅一个月的时间就挖出了砖七十多万块，木材十二万斤，钢铁二百二十三吨，五金十一吨，耐火砖一千吨，这样就给我们办工业打下了物质基础。不懂技术，我们向职工家属发起了“向自己亲人学技术”的号召，学习条件非常有利，在职工家属中，有的丈夫是工程师、技术员，有的是技术工人，特别是党委提出了每个职工要在职工家属办工业过程中做一件好事的口号后，随即，在全厂范围内迅速掀起了互教互学大办工业的热潮，在党委领导下和全体职工大力支援下，经过了三个月的奋战，克服了重重困难，终于办起了小型的、土洋结合的、为大厂服务的五金、铸造、水泥、洋钉等十一个工厂。经过整顿后，目前还有九个。今年1月到现在实现革新项目三百六十四项，提合理化建议五百四十件，实现的五百零五件，提高劳动生产率一点二五倍，创造价值四万三千一百四十元。由于这些社办工业直接为工厂加工，因而使工厂在1959年内节省三十多万元的财富，并为国家创造一百八十六万元财富，有力地支援了我厂的生产。我们厂和全国各兄弟厂一样，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，全体职工的共同努力，提前三年一个月零五天完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标，提前二十七天完成了1959年的总产值计划，提前十六天全面地、超额地完成了全年国家计划。今年又提前十一天半完成了第一季度总产值计划，实现了六十年代首季开门红。
    为了更好地满足职工生活水平日益提高的需要，在党提出：工厂大办副食品生产自给运动的号召下，我们还发动职工和家属，在工厂周围的荒地上大办农场，养猪五百五十头，鸡鸭五千五百只，年产牛奶二十四万多斤，蔬菜三百八十万斤，实现了公共食堂副食品的自给。并依靠全厂职工和家属的义务劳动于1959年冬，建成了一座年产五十万斤鱼的三万平方米的鱼池。另外，在集体饲养、公办农场的同时，还号召组织每户家属自己种菜、养鸡，1959年产蔬菜一百二十万斤，养家禽五千多只，改善了职工的生活，鼓舞了他们的生产热情。
    为了使职工家属无牵无挂地走上社会主义建设的各种劳动岗位，使工厂企业有可靠的“后勤部”，根据党的“一手抓生产一手抓生活”的指示精神，我们还大办了集体生活福利和社会服务事业。在党委统一领导，全面规划，本着自力更生，因陋就简，白手起家，少花钱，多办事的原则。大办托儿所、幼儿班、公共食堂和多种形式的服务性的集体福利事业。共办起五十七处托儿所（站）幼儿班，入托儿童达二千四百多名（除十五处厂办的以外）都是在没有向国家要一文钱、没盖一间房子的情况下，用土办法办起来的，房子是大家互让腾出来的，设备是家属自己拿出来的，保育员是群众自己挑选的。而且都是根据不同需要，为不同对象服务的。其中有的是为女职工和民办工厂女工的儿童服务；有的是为在业余时间女职工和家属参加社会生活而组织的临时服务组；有的是收学龄前儿童，对他们进行“五爱”和“四育”的教育。现在这些组织已经空前巩固并在迅速的发展。保育员们提出：“托儿所赛如家，阿姨赛妈妈”的行动口号，热情的抚育儿童。今年以来，并开展了技术革新，制成了电器报尿器，自动换奶器等十余种器具。为了配合女职工上晚班，保员们提出：“孩子妈妈上晚班，昼夜收托门不关，半夜回家路太远，请你住在哺乳站”。给女职工极大的方便，深受职工的赞扬，先后收到了职工写的一千二百多封表扬信，互相鼓励，因此大大地促进了女职工的生产积极性。全厂女职工有六百五十多名评上了先进生产者和红旗手，仅在今年1、2月份中，就有二千多名女职工在大闹技术革命中提出了三千一百多项革新建议，对提高生产效率起到了显著的作用。
    在解决女职工带孩子问题的同时，吃饭问题也必须同时解决。为此在党委的领导下，本着白手起家、自力更生的原则，兴办了十七处中小型公共食堂，后来根据需要合并为现代化的大食堂三处，满足了全体职工吃饭的需要。食堂炊事人员有90％是由家务劳动解放出来的妇女，她们参加食堂工作后，在党的领导教育下，提高了思想觉悟，很快的掌握了技术并独立地进行工作，获得了很大成绩。值得提出的是，炊事人员在开展三好、五满意的食堂竞赛中，千方百计地研究粗粮细作，食谱多样化，保证了职工吃得好、花钱少。全年共做出主副食三千七百六十种花样，职工们写诗歌颂扬公共食堂：“每日吃三餐、顿顿花样翻，喷香又可口，人人心喜欢，吃得肚里干劲往上添，掀起新高潮，生产大翻番”。最近，食堂炊事人员在党提出的向机械化、自动化进军的伟大号召鼓舞下，人人精神奋发，个个干劲十足，与生产车间协作大搞炊具机械化，实现了洗碗、切菜、淘米、包饺子等四条自动生产线，三十六种机械化、自动化炊具，使炊事人员从笨重体力劳动中解放出来，他们精神更加振奋，更好地为食堂工作跃进而努力。
    我们工厂现在有80％的职工家属参加了社会劳动，但是家务中的一些琐事还牵连她们的精力。她们迫切要求迅速摆脱繁琐的家务负担，以便更好地从事社会劳动和学习。根据这种情况，为了更好的保证生产持续跃进，按着党的指示，我厂又开展了全面地组织职工家属的经济生活，大搞服务事业，一年来由小到大，由分散到集中，在没向国家要钱的情况下，共建立十四处服务站，十九个代销点，一百九十六个邻里互助组，三处理发店和十余处缝纫组。这些依靠群众兴办的服务事业，从买米、买菜到缝缝补补等各个方面，为职工生活服务。1959年共互助产妇病人六百四十三人次，二千五百五十天。使职工尤其是夫妇都上班的职工解决了很大的问题，给予了极大的方便，使他们安心地从事生产。
    广大职工家属参加生产和集体活动，使妇女从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，使家务劳动社会化、集体化，进一步提高了妇女的思想觉悟。经过一年多的社会劳动、集体生活锻炼之后，出现了人人讲生产，个个谈政治，关心国家，照顾集体，把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己的新气象，普遍地建立了人与人之间同志式的平等友爱的关系和民主团结的家庭。
    我们在组织家庭妇女参加社会劳动，广泛地组织居民经济生活方面，一年来，我们的体会是：
    一、必须在党的绝对领导下，坚持政治挂帅，听党的话，掌握总路线、大跃进、人民公社三个法宝，从思想上认识搞好这一工作，对当前社会主义建设的重大意义。正因为通过党的政治思想教育，使广大职工家属认清了目前有利形势，提高了认识，克服了几千年遗留下来的私有观念和狭隘保守意识，彻底破除了封建家长制和男尊女卑的传统残余，调动了广大妇女的积极性，组织到社会劳动和集体生活中来。组织社会劳动，参加集体生活必须贯彻执行党的为生产服务，为职工群众服务的方针。为了贯彻执行党的这一方针，每一工作都必须注意围绕党的中心任务进行工作，千方百计地为党的中心任务而努力。脱离了党的中心任务，我们就什么都不能办好。服从党的领导，听党的话，是我们一切事业成功的最根本的泉源。
    二、发动群众，依靠群众，大搞群众运动，是我们各项工作的根本路线。人民群众是历史的创造者，社会主义革命和社会主义建设是千千万万人民群众的自觉的事业，不发挥大家的积极性和力量，就不能办好一切事业，就不可能有生气勃勃的社会主义建设。组织职工家属参加社会劳动，参加集体生活，搞好职工和家属的集体福利事业亦不能例外。我厂职工家属，多半出身于封建家庭，她们在旧社会受的痛苦和压迫最深、最多。几年来，她们在党的教育下，提高了思想觉悟，他们都具有彻底解放的强烈意志和要求。特别是人民公社的建立，实现家务劳动社会化，使广大妇女群众完全摆脱了被压迫被奴役的历史，她们成为名符其实的社会生产者，她们有巨大的潜在力量。我们的任务，就是如何把她们的智慧和力量充分地发挥和调动起来，为社会主义建设服务。我们正是通过这一工作，在党的领导下，大搞群众运动，做了以上许多工作的。
    解放以来，我们广大职工家属，在党的关怀和教育下，好像一个不懂事的孩子一样，在母亲的温暖的怀抱中成长了起来，我们深深地体会到党的伟大和毛主席思想的伟大。拿我个人来说，过去是一个贫苦的工人家属，解放后与广大妇女一样，在党的培养下，把我们从家务劳动中解放出来，参加生产与工人们一样过着集体生活。妇女们用诗歌来赞美这幸福的生活：
    过去妇女只会做针线，
    整天围着锅台转；
    有心去生产，
    孩子没人管。
    现在围着机器转、什么都能干，
    吃饭进了大食堂，
    孩子送进幼儿班；
    学习政治学文化，
    拿起笔来写诗篇；
    感谢党的好领导，
    毛主席的恩情说不完。
    我们今天的幸福，千言万语也说不完，只有不计名利、不计报酬、全心全意地为社会主义建设的大厦添砖添瓦，与全国人民一道向党和毛主席所指引的方向而奋勇前进！
