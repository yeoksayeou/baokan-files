Comrades Chairman, fellow representatives:
    I fully endorse the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. Now I will report on the progress of trachoma and blindness prevention in Heilongjiang Province for your comments.
    The work of preventing trachoma and blindness in Heilongjiang Province, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, has achieved great success due to the full mobilization of the masses, close integration with production, the hard work of all prevention and treatment personnel, and the active support of the broad masses of the people. In particular, after the on-site conference on trachoma prevention convened by the Central Ministry of Health in our province in 1958, it has developed greatly on the basis of the great leap forward in various undertakings and under the promotion of the new situation.
    First, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the in-depth development of the movement to eliminate pests and diseases, and the establishment of people's communes, more favorable conditions have been created for the prevention of blindness and trachoma. Under the leadership of the Party, and following the principle of combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine and combining specialized personnel with the broad masses, we revised the plan on the existing basis and made arrangements to promote the work comprehensively and rapidly. We have adopted measures such as giving prominence to politics and relying on the masses; integrating with production and making overall arrangements; conducting extensive publicity and repeated mobilization; unified leadership, division of responsibilities; training cadres and vigorously promoting cooperation; combining Chinese and Western medicine, using both indigenous and foreign methods; reducing or waiving fees for mobile prevention and treatment; combining blindness prevention with trachoma prevention; and combining the patriotic health campaign for the prevention of sand and blindness with the prevention and treatment of other diseases. Through the hard work of medical personnel throughout the province, by the end of 1959, a total of more than 170,000 blind people and patients with severe eye diseases had been surgically treated in the province, of which about 120,000 people had recovered their health and improved labor efficiency. In the process of preventing blindness, all parts of the province, in the spirit of vigorously launching mass movements and technical revolutions, have trained 1,390 full-time or part-time ophthalmologists and tens of thousands of trachoma prevention personnel for cities, counties, and townships in our province, thereby strengthening the grassroots prevention and treatment forces. On this favorable basis, a high tide of national participation in the trachoma prevention movement was launched throughout the province. So far, Lanxi County and Mudanjiang City have reached the target requirements for basic trachoma-free cities and counties set by our province, and more than 30 cities and counties are striving to eliminate trachoma before "May 1st" and "October 1st". It is estimated that the prevalence of trachoma in our province this year will be greatly reduced. Therefore, this chronic infectious disease left over from the old society, which has a wide epidemic area, a high prevalence rate, seriously endangers people's health, and affects production, will not only have a declining incidence rate year by year, but will also be eradicated with the development of production and the continuous advancement of cultural, educational, and health undertakings.
    Due to the development of prevention and treatment of blindness and trachoma, trachoma patients have been relieved of their pain, and blind people have regained their sight and participated in production. They are all overjoyed, spreading the news and writing songs and poems to thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Liu Changjiang of Da Sizhan Township in Boli County participated in the work of the potash salt factory for one month after recovering his sight and created wealth worth 145 yuan for the country. Guo Changfu, who was 39 years old and had moved into the nursing home, immediately regained his sight after the operation and participated in production on the fourth day. Xu Chaosheng of Hailun County said that he had lived for more than 80 years and had gone through three dynasties. No dynasty cared so much about blind people. They wrote poems saying:
    Blind people have been blind all their lives since ancient times, and spending money is in vain.
    They blame their fate for not being good, and their ancestors for not having virtue.
    Today, the spring thunder rang, and the Party sent doctors to their homes.
    Breaking superstitions and creating miracles, blind people regain their sight and are no longer blind.
    Blind people see the light of day after many years, just like red flowers blooming on the snow.
    We sincerely thank the Communist Party and add strength to building the motherland.
    They posted big-character posters saying:
        "Blind people see the light, full of joy,
        Thank Chairman Mao, live forever."
    An old stonemason in Nianzishan wanted to spend a year carving a statue of Chairman Mao and hang it in his house so that he could look at him every day.
    Due to the treatment and restoration of sight for hundreds of thousands of blind people and patients with severe eye diseases, and the cure of trachoma, not only has the suffering of patients been eliminated and the occurrence of new blindness been controlled to a great extent, but also a large number of labor forces have been liberated, and more importantly, the relationship between the Party and the masses has been closer, which has produced extremely good political influence among the people.
    The reason why our province has made some achievements in the prevention and treatment of trachoma and blindness is due to: resolutely relying on the leadership of the Party and giving prominence to politics. Without the leadership of the Party, it would not have been possible to treat more than 170,000 blind people and patients with severe eye diseases in the vast rural areas in more than a year. In order to relieve the suffering of the blind, the provincial, regional, county, and township party committees, all the way to the production team, have taken many measures, designated special personnel to be responsible, organized dozens of medical teams, and transferred more than 1,000 cadres to go to every township and village or deep in the mountains and forests to carry out the work. Many health bureau chiefs and county heads personally served as captains of the blindness and sand prevention team, and personally convened cadre meetings and telephone conferences to make arrangements. All cities, counties, and special offices have held large and small on-site meetings, seminars, competitions, and oath-taking meetings. Some leading comrades personally mobilized and organized patients to seek medical treatment and participate in trachoma acceptance and inspection work, and reduced or completely waived all expenses for patients. With these measures, it was ensured that patients did not spend money or spent less money, did not walk or walked very little, and had their eye diseases cured. Similarly, it is precisely because of the leadership of the Party that it has been possible to mobilize thousands of doctors to change the past practice of "doctors not knocking on doors," go deep into the countryside, and go to the mountains and forests to carry out prevention and treatment from door to door, and even perform cataract and glaucoma surgery on the earthen kang, and put forward the slogan "Make your own if you don't have equipment, create your own if you don't have conditions," and "Rather suffer thousands of hardships ourselves, than make things difficult for patients." This noble service attitude has deeply moved patients, who call the blindness prevention team good doctors sent by Chairman Mao. This is a manifestation of medical personnel overcoming bourgeois ideology, going deep into the countryside, and facing production, and it is also a victory of the struggle between the two ideologies of medical personnel.
    Fully mobilize the masses and resolutely rely on the masses. In our work of preventing sand and blindness, the most difficult thing is that there are many patients, the disease is widespread, there are few cadres, and the manpower is insufficient. In order to solve this problem, we have tried every means to train a group of cadres through various forms. At the same time, we used various propaganda tools to carry out a massive propaganda campaign, so that the knowledge of preventing sand and blindness reached every household and everyone knew it, and fully exerted the strength and wisdom of the masses. Most cities and counties have set up trachoma prevention and treatment rooms and stations in each residential group, government office, school, and nursery, created dozens of forms of running water washbasins, and changed the unsanitary habit of a family using a basin of water and a towel. In the prevention and treatment work, the masses themselves compiled poems, performances and other entertainment programs for publicity, established prevention and treatment stations, established systems, and inspected and compared each other with great seriousness, and even formed a trend, even three-year-old children played the game of "treating trachoma, applying eye drops". Because the masses were mobilized and prevention and treatment organizations were established at all levels, the problem of insufficient manpower was solved, equipment and equipment were created, the equipment was solved, and propaganda and education were carried out, and ideological obstacles were eliminated. The prevention and treatment methods have also been improved, and the time required for treating trachoma has been greatly shortened, which has created conditions for further eliminating trachoma.
    Starting from production, serving production, unified arrangements, matching the seat number.
    The purpose of preventing trachoma and blindness is to protect and promote the people's health and serve production, but in the early stage, some masses and some grassroots cadres had insufficient understanding, thinking that "there are not many blind people, and they cannot be cured even if there are," "everyone has trachoma, it doesn't matter whether it is treated or not," "now it is a great leap forward, wait and see," fearing that engaging in the prevention and treatment of diseases would affect production, and there were also a few medical personnel who disregarded production and one-sidedly emphasized prevention and treatment work. In order to solve the relationship between preventing sand and blindness and production, all localities have made unified arrangements and taken some measures to combine the two. Medical teams went deep into residential areas, fields, factories, and mines to conduct on-site inspections, on-site medication, and surgery, and generally achieved: small surgery not out of the village, large surgery not out of the township, eye drops delivered to the home, and fully utilized the labor spare time to conduct inspections and treatment work, reducing the patient's time and impact on production in many ways, and based on the specific circumstances, put forward the prevention and treatment of trachoma and production to "do small things in busy times and do big things in slack times", to ensure that the central work "gives way without stopping" and "do blitz in slack times and grasp the regular in busy times" and other measures, so not only did the trachoma prevention and treatment work not affect production, on the contrary, due to the reduction of eye diseases, the liberation of the blind, and good political influence, promoted the development of production.
    In the past year, our province has achieved great success in the prevention and treatment of trachoma and blindness, but there are still many problems, mainly the unbalanced development of the movement; a few cadres have insufficient understanding and lack of confidence; scientific research work cannot keep up with the actual needs, etc., but we have the confidence and determination, according to the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, to muster greater revolutionary energy, in the new situation, combined with production, taking the elimination of pests and diseases as the center, to further set off a climax of trachoma prevention, and strive to eliminate trachoma at an early date.

### 开展群众性的防治沙眼、防治盲人工作  石增荣代表的发言

专栏：

    开展群众性的防治沙眼、防治盲人工作
    石增荣代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念两位副总理所作的报告。现将黑龙江省防治沙眼、防治盲人工作开展的情况作一汇报，请指正。
    黑龙江省防治沙眼、防治盲人工作，在各级党委的领导下，由于充分发动了群众，密切结合生产，经过全体防治人员的辛勤努力和广大人民的积极支持，取得了很大的成就。特别是1958年中央卫生部在我省召开防治沙眼现场会议以后，在各项事业大跃进的基础上和新形势的推动下，又有了很大的发展。
    一，随着工农业生产的大跃进和除害灭病运动的深入开展，和人民公社的建立，对防治盲人防治沙眼工作创造了更为有利的条件，我们在党的领导下根据中西医药相结合，专门人材与广大群众相结合的方针，在已有的基础上修订了规划，进行了部署，使工作全面迅速的开展起来。我们采取了政治挂帅，依靠群众；结合生产，全面安排；大搞宣传，反复动员；统一领导，分片包干；培养干部，大搞协作；中西结合，土洋并举；减免费用巡回防治；防治盲人与防治沙眼相结合，防沙防盲的爱国卫生运动和其他疾病的防治相结合等措施。经过全省医务人员的辛勤努力，到1959年末止，全省共手术治疗盲人及重眼病人达十七万余人，其中约有十二万余人恢复健康，提高了劳动效率。在防治盲人过程中，全省各地以大搞群众运动、大闹技术革命的精神，为我省各市、县、乡培养了一千三百九十名专职或兼职的眼科医生和数以万计沙眼防治人员，从而加强基层防治力量。在这一有利的基础上，又在全省掀起一个全民参加防治沙眼运动的高潮，到目前为止，已有兰西县、牡丹江市达到了我省提出的基本无沙眼市县的指标要求，有三十多个市县力争在
  “五一”、“十一”以前消灭沙眼，预计今年我省沙眼患病率，将会大大下降，因此，旧社会遗留下来的这种流行面广，患病率高，严重危害人民健康，影响生产的慢性传染病不仅发病率逐年下降，而且它将随着生产的发展，文教卫生事业的不断前进而得到根除。
    由于防治盲人和防治沙眼工作的开展，使沙眼病人解除了痛苦，使盲人重见光明，参加了生产，他们莫不欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告，作歌吟诗，感谢毛主席、感谢共产党。勃利县大四站乡刘长江复明后参加钾盐厂工作一个月，就为国家创造价值一百四十五元的财富。三十九岁就住进了敬老院的郭长富，经手术后立即复明，第四天就参加了生产，海伦县徐朝盛说我活了八十多年，经过三个朝代，没有一个朝代对瞎子还这样关心，他们作诗说：
    古来盲人一世瞎，花钱多少也白搭
    自怨八字没定好，祖上没德命不佳
    今天春雷一声响，党把医生送到家
    破除迷信创奇迹，盲人复明再不瞎
    多年盲人见天日，真如雪地开红花
    衷心感谢共产党，建设祖国把劲加
    他们贴大字报说：
        “盲人见光明，喜气洋洋，
        感谢毛主席，万寿无疆。”
    碾子山有一位老石匠复明后要用一年的时间刻一个毛主席像，挂在屋里，好天天看着他老人家。
    由于成千上万的盲人和重眼病人被医治复明和沙眼的治愈，不仅消除了病人的疾苦，在很大程度上控制新盲人的发生，解放了大批的劳动力，更重要的是密切了党与群众的关系，在人民群众中产生了极为良好的政治影响。
    我省防治沙眼防治盲人工作所以能够取得一些成绩，这是由于：坚决依靠了党的领导、政治挂帅。没有党的领导，在一年多的时间，就不可能在广大农村中治疗十七万多盲人和重眼病人。为了解除盲人的痛苦，省、地区、县委、乡委一直到生产队都采取了很多措施，指定专人负责，组织了几十个医疗队，抽调了一千多名干部，分头深入到每一个乡屯或深山密林中去进行工作。很多卫生局长、县长亲自担当防盲防沙大队长，亲自召开干部会、电话会议进行安排布置，所有的市县、专署都开过大大小小的现场会、座谈会、比武会、誓师会，有些领导同志亲自动员组织病人就诊和参加沙眼验收检查工作，减收或者完全免收病人的一切费用。有了这些措施，保证了病人没花钱或少花钱，没走路或走很少的路，就治好眼病。同样，也正是由于党的领导，才有可能动员了几千名医生，一变过去那种“医不叩门”的作风，深入农村，走进深山密林挨门逐户进行防治，甚至在土炕上就开刀割白内障，青光眼，并提出“没有器械自己制，没有条件自己造”，“自己宁受千辛万苦，不叫病人一事为难”的口号。这种高尚的服务态度，使病人深受感动，称防盲队是毛主席派来的好医生。这是医务人员克服资产阶级思想、深入农村、面向生产的表现，也是医务人员两种思想斗争的胜利。
    充分发动群众，坚决依靠群众。我们在防沙防盲工作中，最感到困难的是病人多，患病面广，干部少，人力不足。为解决这一问题，我们千方百计地通过各种形式，培养了一批干部。同时用各种宣传工具，开展了声势浩大的宣传运动。使防沙防盲知识达到家喻户晓，人人皆知，充分发挥了群众的力量和智慧，大部分市县在每个居民组、机关、学校、托儿所都设立了沙眼防治室、防治站，创造几十种形式的流水洗脸器，改变了一家人用一盆脸水一条毛巾的不卫生习惯，在防治工作中，群众自己编写了诗歌、演唱等文娱节目进行宣传，成立了防治站，建立了制度，互相检查评比，极其认真，甚至形成一种风气，连三岁小孩都作起“治沙眼，点眼药”的游戏。由于发动了群众，建立各级防治组织，人力不足的问题解决了，创造了器材和设备，器材解决了，开展了宣传教育，思想障碍扫除了。防治方法也有了改进，治疗沙眼所需要的时间也有了很大的缩短，这就为进一步消灭沙眼，创造了条件。
    从生产出发为生产服务，统一安排，对号入座。
    防治沙眼防治盲人的目的是为了保护与增进人民身体健康，为生产服务的，但在初期有些群众和一些基层干部认识不足，认为“瞎子没几个，有也治不好”“沙眼谁都有，治不治都可以”“现在大跃进，等等再说”怕搞防治疾病工作影响生产，也有少数医务人员不顾生产，片面强调防治工作，为了解决防沙防盲与生产的关系，各地都进行统一安排，采取了一些措施，使二者结合起来，医疗队深入居民点、田间、厂矿，进行就地检查，就地投药、手术，并一般的作到：小手术不出屯、大手术不出乡、眼药送到家，充分利用劳动空余时间进行检查和治疗工作，从多方面减少病人的时间和对生产的影响，并根据具体情况，提出防治沙眼与生产要“小忙大搞大忙小搞”，保证与中心工作“让路不停车”以及“不忙搞突击，忙时抓经常”等措施，因此不但没有因开展沙眼防治工作影响生产，相反由于眼病的减少，盲人的解放，和良好政治影响，促进了生产的发展。
    一年来我省防治沙眼，防治盲人工作，虽然取得了很大的成就，但也存在着许多问题，主要是运动发展的不平衡；有少数干部认识不足，信心不大；科学研究工作跟不上实际需要等，但我们有信心、有决心，根据党的八届八中全会精神，鼓足更大革命干劲，在新的形势下，结合生产，以除害灭病为中心，进一步掀起沙眼防治高潮，为早日消灭沙眼而奋斗。（附图片）
