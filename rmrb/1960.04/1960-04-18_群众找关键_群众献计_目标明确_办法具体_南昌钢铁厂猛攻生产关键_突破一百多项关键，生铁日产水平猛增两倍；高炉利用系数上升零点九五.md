    Nanchang Steel Plant Vigorously Attacks Production Key Problems
    Breakthroughs in Over 100 Key Problems, Pig Iron Daily Production Levels Increase More Than Twofold; Blast Furnace Utilization Coefficient Rises by 0.95
    (Our newspaper's Nanchang dispatch on the 17th) The Nanchang Steel Plant in Jiangxi Province's Party Committee fully mobilized the masses, seized key issues in production, and continuously organized "attack the problem" campaigns, enabling breakthroughs in production key problems at every level and continuously refreshing steel production. This year, through two "attack the problem" campaigns, it has broken through over 100 major production key problems, increased the daily production level of pig iron by more than twofold, and gradually increased the average utilization coefficient from 0.5 to 1.45. Currently, this plant is carrying out its third "attack the problem" campaign.
    The Nanchang Steel Plant is a large steel enterprise established in Jiangxi Province during the Great Leap Forward. There are many new workers and insufficient technical strength. In the past, the smelting technology barrier had not been broken through, and pig iron production did not increase rapidly. Based on this situation, the plant's Party Committee decided to launch "attack the problem" movements continuously around the key problems of production, mobilizing all employees.
    Production is done by the masses, and key problems must also be found by the masses. Before each "attack the problem" campaign, the Nanchang Steel Plant's Party Committee deeply mobilized workers in each workshop, trade, and process to carry out find-the-key-problem and define-the-key-problem activities, and put forward suggestions for tackling the key problems based on the key issues. For example, the raw materials workshop, in response to the situation that coke and limestone always fell short of the supply line in the past, decided to focus on the ideological key problem, do a lot of political and ideological work, and put forward the slogan "Ensure that every shift has full material storage." Employees in the coking workshop proposed focusing on furnace temperature, breaking through the moisture barrier, and removing coke. In this way, through mass-based find-the-key-problem, define-the-key-problem, and offer-plans activities, clear goals and specific methods were achieved, thereby ensuring the smooth development of the attack-the-problem campaign.
    After each unit puts forward the key problems of production, the plant's Party Committee classifies and ranks these key problems, seizes the main key problems, concentrates superior forces, engages in large-scale attack-the-problem performances, sets an example, and promotes overall progress. On February 10th, the plant's Party Committee organized superior forces to first carry out a plant-wide attack-the-problem performance at the No. 2 blast furnace. The second shift foreman of this blast furnace was taken on by the plant's engineer, the No. 2 blast furnace foreman took on the job of squad leader, the squad leader took on the job of recorder, and the four deputy squad leaders took charge of the furnace front operations, and the Party Branch Secretary directed the sand mold making. Due to the strong technical strength, reasonable labor organization, and leaders' personal presence on the front lines, the operation was orderly and efficient. The pig iron produced by this shift reached 86 tons, more than 10 tons more than the first shift. The ironmaking employees were greatly inspired by this performance. Then each workshop, trade, and process also, according to their own production key problems, dispatched stronger leading cadres and advanced producers to hold dozens of large and small attack-the-problem performances. Through performance, teaching technology, and summarizing experience, advanced role models were established in every production link, and the operating skills of employees were comprehensively improved.
    In order to mobilize all employees in the plant to break through the key problems of production and promptly promote the various advanced experiences in the attack-the-problem performance, the plant's Party Committee, while organizing the attack-the-problem performance, mobilized employees in various workshops, trades, and processes to extensively carry out a one-dragon race, counterpart race, and opponent race, and other forms of attack-the-problem competitions, so that they were closely combined with the attack-the-problem performance, interspersed with each other, and complemented each other.
    Focusing on the key problems of production and engaging in large-scale technological innovation is an important part of the Nanchang Steel Plant's "attack the problem" campaign. Since the plant launched the "attack the problem" campaign this year, it has realized more than 100 technological innovation projects such as full-blast-air mud-gun sealing, automatic material level probe, and production during repair, which have powerfully promoted the continuous leap forward in pig iron daily production levels. For example, in the past, no one in the ironmaking workshop's No. 2 blast furnace dared to use full-blast-air mud-gun sealing. In this year's "attack the problem" campaign, furnace front worker Yi Hansheng used his brains, innovated operating techniques, and improved the mud gun, finally succeeding in using full-blast-air mud-gun sealing, enabling the entire workshop to quickly realize large air volume, high air temperature, and full-blast-air mud-gun sealing operations, and the daily output increased sharply.
    In the "attack the problem" campaign, the plant's Party Committee extensively organized attack-the-problem collaboration. Departments and auxiliary workshops fully supported the production workshops; the trades and processes of the production workshops closely cooperated with each other, and the coordination between the previous shift and the next shift was also done very well. For example, in order to ensure the blast furnace's needs for air, water, and steam, the power workshop took the initiative to send people to the ironmaking workshop to understand the situation and closely cooperated with the blast furnace, overcoming the disconnection phenomenon that the blast furnace needed to increase air and steam in the past, but the power workshop could not increase them, and when the power workshop could increase air volume and steam sufficiently, the blast furnace did not need it.

    南昌钢铁厂猛攻生产关键
    突破一百多项关键，生铁日产水平猛增两倍；高炉利用系数上升零点九五
    本报南昌17日电　江西省南昌钢铁厂党委充分发动群众，抓住生产中的关键问题，不断组织“攻关”战役，使生产关键层层突破，钢铁产量不断刷新。今年通过两次“攻关”战役，突破重大生产关键一百多项，生铁日产水平提高了两倍多，平均利用系数由零点五逐步上升到一点四五。目前，这个厂正在开展第三次“攻关”战役。
    南昌钢铁厂是江西省在大跃进中建立起来的一个较大的钢铁企业，新工人多，技术力量不足，过去冶炼技术关没有突破，生铁产量增长不快。厂党委根据这一情况，决定围绕生产关键，发动全体职工不断开展“攻关”运动。
    生产是群众搞的，关键也要由群众来找。南昌钢铁厂党委在每一个“攻关”战役之前，都深入发动各车间、工种、工序的工人，开展找关、定关活动，并根据关键问题提出攻关建议。如原料车间针对过去焦炭、石灰石总是亏料线的情况，决定抓住思想关，大作政治思想工作，提出“保证班班料满仓”的口号。焦化车间职工提出以炉温为主，攻破水分关，扒焦关。这样，通过群众性的找关、定关、献计，做到了目标明确、办法具体，从而保证了攻关战役的顺利开展。
    在各单位提出生产关键以后，厂党委便对这些关键分类排队，抓住主要关键，集中优势兵力，大搞攻关表演，作出榜样，推动全面。2月10日，厂党委组织优势力量在二号高炉首先开展了全厂性的攻关表演。这座高炉的第二班值班长由厂工程师担任，二号高炉炉长担任工长，工长担任记录员，四个副工长分别担任炉前操作，党支部书记指挥作砂模。由于技术力量强、劳动组织合理、领导亲临前线，因而操作井然有序，工效显著提高。这一班产的生铁达八十六吨，比第一班多产铁十吨以上。炼铁职工通过这次表演，得到了很大启发。接着各车间、工种、工序，也根据自己的生产关键，抽调较强的领导干部、先进生产者举行了数十次大小攻关表演。通过边表演，边传授技术，边总结经验，各个生产环节都树立了先进的榜样，全面提高了职工的操作技术。
    为了调动全厂职工大破生产关键，及时推广攻关表演中的各项先进经验，厂党委在组织攻关表演的同时，发动各个车间、工种、工序之间的职工，普遍开展了一条龙赛，对口赛、对手赛等多种形式的攻关竞赛，使之与攻关表演紧密结合，穿插进行，相辅相成。
    针对生产关键，大搞技术革新，是南昌钢铁厂“攻关”战役的重要内容。全厂从今年开展“攻关”战役以来，已经实现了全风堵口、自动探料尺、边检修边生产等一百多项技术革新项目，有力地促进了生铁日产水平的连续跃进。例如，炼铁车间二号高炉过去从来没有人敢全风堵口，在今年“攻关”战役中，炉前工易汉生开动脑筋，革新了操作技术，改进了泥枪，终于采用全风堵口成功，使全车间迅速实现了大风量、高风温、全风堵口操作，日产量急剧上升。
    在“攻关”战役中，厂党委广泛组织了攻关协作。科室、辅助车间全力支援生产车间；生产车间的工种、工序之间，上一班与下一班紧密配合，协同动作也做得很好。如动力车间为了保证高炉对风、水、汽的需要，主动派人到炼铁车间了解情况，同高炉密切配合，克服了过去高炉需要加风、加汽，动力车间加不上，动力车间能加大风量、加足汽时，高炉又不需要的脱节现象。
