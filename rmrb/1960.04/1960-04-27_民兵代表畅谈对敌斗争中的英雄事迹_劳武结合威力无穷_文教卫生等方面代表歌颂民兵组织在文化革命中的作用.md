Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: Representatives attending the National Militia Congress, in high spirits, reported to the Party and the state at the congress and in medium and small-sized meetings on the great victories they had achieved on the fronts of fighting against the enemy, defending the land and sea borders, maintaining social order, and strengthening national defense construction. The many moving deeds cited by the representatives in their speeches fully demonstrate that Chairman Mao's great concept of people's war has been further developed in the current new historical period in our country. Running militia divisions on a large scale has not only played a significant role on the production and construction front but has also fully demonstrated its powerful strength in the struggle to defend the motherland.

Militia representatives from the land and sea borders pointed out in their speeches that the militia is a powerful assistant to the People's Liberation Army in the struggle against the enemy. On the long defense lines of the motherland, the vast numbers of militia and local garrison troops are as close as brothers. They jointly patrol and stand guard in peacetime and fight together in wartime, and the army and the people victoriously defend the security of the motherland. Militia representatives from the Fujian front said that in recent years, hundreds of thousands of militia in Fujian have cooperated with the army in more than 15,000 battles and fought independently in more than 11,900 battles. They and the People's Liberation Army have established an iron wall-like people's defense line on the coast. In the battle of Dongshan Island, the militia of the entire island actively cooperated with the army and heroically annihilated the enemy. They said that at that time, the enemy parachuted more than 300 paratroopers at the Bachimen ferry, attempting to cut off the passage for our reinforcements to enter the island and annihilate our island garrison. However, as soon as the enemy paratroopers landed, they were met with a powerful blow from the militia armed with rifles, hoes, wooden sticks, and carrying poles. The heroic militiamen Lin Dusheng and others, while cooperating with a platoon of sailors from the People's Liberation Army in firmly defending the Bachimen ferry, fought the enemy with kitchen knives, seized a machine gun from the enemy, and repelled three enemy attacks, ensuring the smooth entry of reinforcements into Dongshan Island for combat. In 1958, in the battle where our frontline troops severely punished the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Jinmen, the militia of Xiamen, Weitou, and Da Deng Island and Xiao Deng Island not only undertook war support tasks such as building roads, repairing fortifications, transporting ammunition, and rescuing the wounded, but also directly participated in the artillery battles, and more than 400 militia gloriously performed meritorious service.

Many representatives in their speeches warmly praised the great role played by the militia in protecting production and maintaining social order. They said that on the vast ocean and fertile land of our great motherland, villages and ports everywhere have strong people's defense lines. Whether the enemy falls from the sky or crawls from the sea, they cannot escape the dragnet laid down by the vast militia and the People's Liberation Army. Chen Yangcai, deputy political commissar of the Huangqi Peninsula Militia Regiment, said that wherever there are fishermen, there are people's armed forces protecting the fishermen's production. He said that in recent years, the Dinghai Militia Regiment has fought the enemy at sea 141 times to protect the production of fishermen, killing or wounding 12 enemies, capturing 40 enemies, and seizing 11 enemy ships, 4 light machine guns, and 29 rifles and pistols, often causing the enemy to flee in panic. Xue Jinshui, the battalion commander of the Dongshan Militia Battalion of the Xincheng People's Commune in Rui'an County, Zhejiang Province, said that the "Dongshan Militia Escort Team" he led regularly patrols at sea to protect the safety of fishermen's lives and property.

The vast numbers of militia are constantly vigilant in monitoring the special agent activities of the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. As soon as they discover airborne or sneaking special agents, they immediately take action, launching encirclement and suppression operations across the mountains and plains, making it impossible for them to escape. The representatives said that in 1958, the Chiang gang airdropped three special agents into the Shiwan Mountains in Guangxi. The local militia immediately cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to jointly encircle and suppress them. In less than 24 hours, the militia captured all of these special agents alive. The militia representative from the Northeast said that in January 1953, a US imperialist military aircraft invading our country's airspace was shot down by our air force over Wulongbei in Andong. Eleven American robbers who parachuted, including Colonel Commander Arnold, were captured alive by the militia. The militia representatives from the Fujian front said that in October of the year before last, after large-scale militia divisions were established, they laid down a dragnet and captured the Chiang Kai-shek military pilot Zhang Naijun, who was shot down and parachuted, alive.

The speeches of the representatives show that in order to better cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in fulfilling the sacred duty and right entrusted to them by the Party and the state to defend the motherland and defend against imperialist aggression, under the principle of "combining labor and military affairs, with labor as the main focus," the militia on all fronts closely combine production, work, and learning professional skills, and unremittingly strive to learn modern military science knowledge and military technology. Many militia members have not only trained themselves to be good marksmen but have also learned various military skills for ground, sea, and air combat. The representatives attending this conference include not only many female sharpshooters who can "shoot a hundred paces through Yang," sharpshooters who hit the bullseye with every shot, and representatives of battalion, company, and platoon units who shoot "full house red," but also all-round shooters who are excellent in shooting five types of weapons, including rifles, pistols, light and heavy machine guns, and cannons, and anti-aircraft gunners who hit aerial targets at a distance of more than 1,700 meters.

The representatives unanimously pointed out that running militia divisions on a large scale is a fundamental measure for us to defend against imperialist aggression and protect socialist construction. In the past, we relied on the vast militia to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to defeat the enemy and achieve victory in the revolutionary war. Today, we respond to Chairman Mao's call to run militia divisions on a large scale and have further unleashed the power of the people's armed forces. We are a great socialist country and will never invade anyone, but we will never allow anyone to invade us either. If the imperialists dare to launch a war of aggression against our great motherland, the hundreds of millions of militia across the country will resolutely join the People's Liberation Army in drowning them in the vast ocean of all the people being soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: Militia representatives from culture, education, health, finance, and trade, who are attending the National Militia Congress, have enthusiastically praised the positive role of running militia divisions on a large scale in promoting the vigorously developing technical revolution and cultural revolution movement in plenary meetings, medium-sized meetings, and group meetings in the past two days.

Militia representatives from the culture and education front pointed out in their speeches that under the guidance of the Party's policy of "education serving politics, and education combined with productive labor," and under the brilliant illumination of the general line, the militia organization has played a great role in realizing the intellectualization of workers and peasants and the laborization of intellectuals, and cultivating socialist builders and defenders who are both red and expert, and capable of both literary and military affairs. Su Sheng, a militia representative from Liaoning University, said that the militia battalion of the Department of Mathematics entered scientific research in a combat posture, formed 143 combat teams, packed their luggage, and rushed to more than 70 factories, mines, enterprises, transportation departments, and scientific research institutions in Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Jinzhou, etc., to vigorously attack "mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation." Under the leadership of the Party Committee, they closely combined with workers and technicians, and after 20 days of hard work, completed 2,847 scientific research projects, equivalent to 47 times the total in the past six years, and exceeded the annual scientific research plan for 1960 ten months ahead of schedule. Feng Qi, a militia representative from Harbin Normal University, said that after studying the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army, the militia in their college greatly changed the students' spiritual outlook.

Representatives from Hunan, Henan, Jiangxi and other places vividly introduced the moving deeds of the local rural militia organizations, under the leadership of the Party, running Red and Expert Schools, cultural night schools, and courageously marching towards culture and science. They said that the vast number of militia members are making rapid progress on the cultural learning front. The militia company of the Chengguan People's Commune in Dengfeng County, with the Red and Expert School as its position, all militia members in the company have reached the level of higher primary school or above. Wang Yiren, the militia company commander and night school principal who was illiterate before liberation, said that in recent years, he has studied hard in the militia organization, not only served as a night school teacher, but also published many news reports, novels, scripts, and other works in provincial, prefectural, and county newspapers and magazines.

On the health and sports front, representatives from Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Kunming, and other places enthusiastically praised the militia organization for serving as a shock force in eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and carrying out large-scale sports activities in their speeches, and a large number of models have emerged. Chen Yukun, a militia representative from Renji Hospital in Shanghai, said that in the patriotic health campaign, thanks to the full play of the militia organization's shock and combat role, the hospital has been rated as a city-level advanced health unit for two consecutive years. Representatives from Beijing, Jilin and other places pointed out in their speeches that running militia divisions on a large scale has led to a high tide of sports activities in various places. "Exercise to protect the motherland" has become the action slogan of the vast number of militia members. The physical fitness of the militia has been generally enhanced, and a large number of sports experts have emerged. 90% of the militia of Xi'an Railway College reached the first and second level standards of the Labor and Defense System. They originally did not have a national-level athlete, but last year suddenly had 200. More than 3,000 militia members of Tsinghua University have made great progress in sports performance in national defense sports activities, and motorcycle athletes won two championships in the First National Games.

Many representatives from the finance and trade front used a large number of vivid examples to illustrate that, because the vast number of militia members further studied the People's Liberation Army's thinking of serving the people wholeheartedly, they have made significant achievements in improving service quality and protecting state property. Xu Jinyao, chief of staff of the militia regiment of the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store, said that their store is located on Nanjing Road, the most prosperous and densely populated area in Shanghai, and operates more than 46,000 kinds of goods, with an average of about 150,000 customers per day, and the business is very busy. After large-scale militia divisions were established, the militia members proposed: "Work like the People's Liberation Army fighting battles, and be on duty like the People's Liberation Army standing guard," giving full play to the power of the militia organization, this fighting collective. Militia representatives from the finance and trade front in Shanxi, Changchun, Tianjin and other provinces and cities also unanimously pointed out that, under the leadership of the Party, through running militia divisions on a large scale and carrying out military and political training, the spiritual outlook of the vast number of militia members has been effectively changed. Yang Zhong, a representative of the commercial militia division in Hexi District, Tianjin City, said that their militia division received 130,000 letters of praise from customers in the past year alone.

    劳武结合威力无穷
    文教卫生等方面代表歌颂民兵组织在文化革命中的作用
    据新华社26日讯　全国民兵代表会议代表，意气风发地在大会和中、小型会议上，向党和国家汇报他们在对敌斗争、保卫陆海边防、维护社会治安、加强国防建设等战线上取得的伟大胜利。代表们在发言中所列举的许多动人事迹，充分表明毛主席人民战争的伟大思想，在我国当前新的历史时期，得到了进一步的发展。大办民兵师不仅在生产建设战线上发挥了重大作用，而且在保卫祖国的斗争中，充分显示了它的强大威力。
    来自陆海边防的民兵代表在发言中指出，民兵在对敌斗争中，是人民解放军的有力助手。在祖国漫长的国防线上，广大民兵和当地驻军情同手足。平时共同巡逻放哨，战时一起作战，军民胜利地保卫了祖国的安全。福建前线民兵代表说，几年来，福建数十万民兵，配合部队作战达一万五千多次，独立作战一万一千九百多次。他们和解放军在海岸线上，建立了铜墙铁壁般的人民防线。在东山岛战斗中，全岛民兵积极配合军队英勇歼灭了敌人。他们说，那时敌人在八尺门渡口空降伞兵三百多人，企图切断我增援部队入岛的通路，歼灭我岛上守军。但敌人伞兵刚落地，就遭到手拿步枪、锄头、木棒、扁担的民兵的有力的打击。英勇的民兵林笃生等在配合解放军一个水兵班固守八尺门渡口时，拿着菜刀与敌拼杀，夺了敌人一挺机枪，先后打退敌人三次进攻，保证了增援部队顺利进入东山岛作战。1958年，前线我军严惩金门蒋军战斗中，厦门、围头和大嶝岛、小嶝岛的民兵，不仅担负了修筑公路、抢修工事、运输弹药、救护伤员等战勤任务，还直接参加了炮战，并且有四百多民兵光荣立了功。
    许多代表在发言中热烈颂扬民兵在保卫生产、维护社会治安中所发挥的伟大作用。他们说，在我们伟大祖国辽阔的海洋和富饶的土地上，村与村，港与港，到处都有坚强的人民防线。无论敌人是从天上掉下来，或是从海里爬上来，都逃不出广大民兵和人民解放军所布下的天罗地网。黄岐半岛民兵团副政治委员陈杨才说，那里有渔民，那里就有保卫渔民生产的人民武装。他说，几年来，定海民兵团为保护渔民生产，在海上与敌人作战一百四十一次，打死打伤敌人十二名，俘虏敌人四十名，缴获敌船十一只，轻机枪四挺，长短枪二十九支。常常打得敌人望风而逃。浙江省瑞安县莘塍人民公社东山民兵营营长薛金水说，他率领的“东山民兵护航队”，经常在海上巡逻，保护渔民生命财产的安全。
    广大民兵时刻警惕地监视着美蒋匪帮的特务活动，一发现空投和偷潜特务时，就迅速行动起来，漫山遍野进行围剿，叫它们插翅难逃，无一漏网。代表们说，1958年，蒋帮在广西的十万大山，空降三名特务，当地民兵立即配合人民解放军合力围剿，不到二十四小时，民兵们就把这股特务全部活捉了。东北的民兵代表说，1953年1月，美帝国主义侵略我国领空的军用飞机，在安东五龙背上空被我空军击落，十一名跳伞的美国强盗，包括上校司令阿诺德，都被民兵活捉。福建前线的民兵代表们说，前年10月，大办民兵师以后，他们撒下天罗地网活捉了被我空军击落跳伞的蒋军飞行员张乃军。
    代表们的发言表明，全国民兵为了更好地配合人民解放军履行党和国家交给他们的保卫祖国、防御帝国主义侵略的神圣义务和权利，在“劳武结合、以劳为主”的原则下，各个战线上的民兵都紧密地结合生产、工作和学习专业，坚持不懈地努力学习现代军事科学知识和军事技术。许多民兵不但练成了一手好枪法，还学得了地面、海上和对空作战的多种军事技能。出席这次会议的代表们，不仅有许多“百步穿杨”的女射手，枪枪命中红心的神枪手，和射击“满堂红”的营、连、排单位的代表，而且有步枪、手枪、轻重机枪、大炮五种武器射击全部优秀的射击多面手，和击中一千七百多米空中目标的高射炮手。
    代表们一致指出，大办民兵师，这是我们防御帝国主义侵略、保卫社会主义建设的根本措施。过去，我们依靠广大的民兵，配合人民解放军打败了敌人，取得了革命战争的胜利。今天，我们响应毛主席大办民兵师的号召，更加发挥了人民武装的威力。我们是伟大的社会主义国家，决不会侵犯任何人，但是也决不容许任何人侵犯我们。如果帝国主义胆敢向我们伟大的祖国发动侵略战争，全国亿万民兵就坚决和人民解放军一道，把它们淹没在全民皆兵的汪洋大海里。
    据新华社26日讯　出席全国民兵代表会议的文教、卫生、财贸等方面的民兵代表，这两天在全体会议、中型会议和小组会上，热情地歌颂大办民兵师对于正在蓬勃发展的技术革命、文化革命运动的积极促进作用。
    来自文教战线上的民兵代表发言指出，在党的“教育为政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针指导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，民兵组织对于实现工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化，培养又红又专、能文能武的社会主义建设者和保卫者，起了很大作用。辽宁大学民兵代表苏生说，数学系民兵营以战斗姿态投入科学研究，组成一百四十三个战斗小队，背上行李，奔赴沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、锦州等七十多个厂矿、企业、交通运输部门和科学研究机关，猛攻“机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化”。他们在党委的领导下，同工人、技术人员密切结合，经过二十天日夜奋战，完成了科学研究项目二千八百四十七项，相当于过去六年总和的四十七倍，提前十个月超额完成了1960年全年的科学研究计划。哈尔滨师范学院民兵代表冯起说，他们学院民兵在学习解放军的光荣传统后，大大改变了学生的精神面貌。
    湖南、河南、江西等地代表生动地介绍了各地农村民兵组织，在党的领导下，大办红专学校、文化夜校，奋勇向文化科学进军的动人事迹。他们说，广大民兵在文化学习战线上进展极快。登封县城关人民公社民兵连以红专学校为阵地，全连民兵都达到了高小或高小以上的水平。解放前一字不识的民兵连长兼夜校校长王仪仁说，几年来，他在民兵组织里刻苦学习，不但担任了夜校教师，而且还在省、专区、县的报刊杂志上发表了许多通讯、小说、剧本等作品。
    在卫生、体育的战线上，上海、天津、广州、昆明等地代表，都在发言中热烈赞扬民兵组织在除四害、讲卫生、大搞体育运动中，充当了突击队，涌现出大量标兵。上海仁济医院民兵代表陈玉昆说，在爱国卫生运动中，由于充分发挥民兵组织的突击和战斗作用，医院连续两年被评为市级卫生先进单位。北京、吉林等地代表发言指出，大办民兵师使各地都出现了体育活动的高潮。“锻炼身体、保卫祖国”成了广大民兵的行动口号。民兵体质普遍增强，体育能手大量涌现出来。西安铁道学院90％的民兵达到了劳卫制一、二级标准。他们原来一个国家等级运动员也没有，去年一跃出现了二百名。清华大学有三千多民兵在国防体育活动中运动水平突飞猛进，摩托运动员在第一届全国运动会上获得了两项冠军。
    财贸战线上许多代表以大量生动事例说明，由于广大民兵进一步学习了人民解放军全心全意为人民服务的思想，因而对提高服务质量和保护国家资财，作出了显著的成就。上海市第一百货商店民兵团参谋长许金瑶说，他们的商店设在上海最繁华、人口最集中的南京路上，经营着四万六千多种商品，顾客每天平均约有十五万人次，业务非常繁忙。大办民兵师后，民兵们提出：“工作像解放军打仗一样，值班像解放军站岗一样”，充分发挥民兵组织这个战斗的集体的威力。山西、长春、天津等省市财贸战线上的民兵代表们也一致指出，在党的领导下，通过大办民兵师和开展军、政训练，有效地改变着广大民兵的精神面貌。天津市河西区商业民兵师代表杨忠说，他们的民兵师仅在去年一年内即收到广大顾客寄来的各种表扬信十三万件。
