    Raise Ideological Awareness, Accelerate the Economic and Technical Revolution Movement in Urban and Rural Areas
    Xǔ Jiātún, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    The new high tide of the technological revolution movement is the inevitable product of China's political and economic development.

    China's socialist construction has entered a new stage of high-speed development. A great Marxist-Leninist economic and technological revolution movement in urban and rural areas has emerged. In Jiangsu Province, this movement has developed into a mass revolutionary movement. The momentum, scope, depth of impact, and magnitude of the effects of this movement are all unprecedented. Moving scenes are appearing everywhere, with fitters throwing away files, blacksmiths discarding sledgehammers, construction sites with groups of "dragons" flying and showing their might, stations and docks eliminating shoulder carrying and manual labor, rice paddies being planted without bending over, banks counting money without using hands, canteens cutting vegetables without knives, and tofu shops driving away little donkeys. People have also greatly broken away from the mystified view of science and technology, vigorously engaged in automation and semi-automation, vigorously trial-produced new products, developed new technologies, adopted new processes, innovated product designs, carried out scientific research, and marched forward towards the peak of world science and technology with heads held high. According to statistics from six cities including Nanjing and Wuxi, in the three months of this year, 811 automatic production lines, 2,867 production assembly lines, 7,683 automated single machines, and 833 automated workshops, sections, and groups have been implemented, saving 69,413 workers. In addition, 13,930 new products have been successfully trial-produced, many of which have reached advanced levels at home and abroad. Now, the face of production technology throughout the province is undergoing profound changes.

    The emergence of the new high tide of the technological revolution movement is the inevitable trend of China's political and economic development. It is the inevitable product of the implementation of the general line of socialist construction, the realization of the Great Leap Forward, and the development of people's communes under the leadership of the Party. This new situation concentratesly reflects the strong desire and high self-confidence of the broad masses of the people to rapidly change the economic and cultural outlook of our country. Under the socialist system, this desire and self-confidence of the people will inevitably be expressed in positive actions. Especially under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, people's spiritual outlook is constantly undergoing profound changes, and their communist consciousness is constantly improving. The working people, who have been liberated economically, politically, ideologically, and spiritually, will inevitably concentrate all their will and strength on the great goal of accelerating the construction of socialism and creating conditions for the transition to communism. To vigorously engage in the technological and cultural revolution has naturally become the urgent requirement and conscious action of the broad masses of the people. In 1958, Comrade Mao Zedong issued a great call to the whole Party and the entire people to break down superstitions, liberate thought, and promote the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act. This call not only reflected the aspirations of the people but also gave them tremendous encouragement and unparalleled motivation. Because Mao Zedong Thought has deeply rooted itself in the hearts of the people and the Party's general line and a complete set of two-legged walking policies have taken root in the hearts of the people, the broad masses of the people are even more enthusiastic, spirited, diligently studying, and boldly creating. Therefore, a brilliant scene of rapid changes has emerged in the technological revolution. We must conscientiously study Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the spirit of continuous revolution, and further extensively and deeply carry out the economic and technological revolution movement in urban and rural areas.

    To carry out the technological revolution movement, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command.

    The process of technological innovation and technological revolution is a process of people understanding nature and conquering nature, and it is also a process of people transforming their own thinking. In class society, people's struggle against nature is always closely related to social class struggle; even after classes are eliminated, the struggle between man and nature will always be closely linked with the ideological struggle between people, such as the struggle between new and old, advanced and backward, science and superstition. The technological revolution is carried out by people, so it is necessary to constantly resolve the contradictions in people's thinking and improve their understanding. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." ("Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" postscript) Only by taking political work and ideological work as the soul and commander can the technological revolution continuously move forward, achieve new successes, and reach new peaks.

    The 1960s will be an era in which mankind will release even greater brilliance in science and technology. Today, major new scientific and technological topics that mark mankind's further understanding and transformation of nature, such as the realization of comprehensive automation of production, the use of nuclear fusion power, the study of the mysteries of life processes, and the exploration of outer space, can only be rapidly developed in socialist countries and applied for the purpose of benefiting mankind. Advanced science and technology always belong to the emerging class and the advanced social system. As social history has developed to this day, the capitalist system has become a shackle on the progress of science and technology. The great mission of mankind to further transform the world and conquer nature will inevitably fall on the shoulders of the proletariat. The great development of modern science and technology will inevitably appear in places where the revolutionary practice is the richest and the theoretical thinking is the most active under the socialist system. It is a manifestation of the failure to fundamentally transform the bourgeois worldview and the lack of the proletariat's great ambition to blindly believe in capitalist technical theories and technical routes, belittle oneself, stick to conventions, and always be afraid to take big strides and not support the creative inventions of the masses. As proletarian revolutionaries, we should consciously improve our communist consciousness, strengthen the proletariat's sense of responsibility and self-confidence in transforming the world, be full of ambition, be persevering, be courageous in practice, and be courageous in creation.

    To transform nature, we must first understand nature. Nature is completely knowable, and this must be affirmed, otherwise we will fall into the quagmire of agnosticism. However, it should also be admitted that today mankind's understanding of nature is still very limited, which affects mankind's further conquest of nature. To accelerate the transformation of nature, it is necessary to accelerate the understanding of nature. This requires us to constantly break down superstitions, liberate our minds, dare to think and dare to act, and improve our understanding of nature at high speed. The movement of technological revolution is a movement in which people's thinking is constantly liberated, and it is also a movement in which people constantly improve their understanding of nature, thereby constantly transforming nature. When people's thinking is liberated and their understanding is improved, it will also promote the development of the technological revolution. However, some people have not recognized this point, and they are often ideologically closed, sit in a well and look at the sky, and become complacent when they achieve results, believing that they have reached advanced levels at home and abroad. Therefore, they "stop here," stick to the old ways, and stop moving forward. From the current point of view, although we have achieved great success in the technological revolution, the development of technology is endless, and our past work is only like completing the first step of the Long March. Therefore, in the technological revolution, we must firmly establish the idea of continuous revolution, be indomitable, and move forward forever.

    The fundamental purpose of our revolution and construction is to thoroughly liberate the productive forces, promote the continuous development of social production, and thus meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people. The process of technological revolution is also a process of further improving productivity and developing production more, faster, better, and more economically. Countless facts prove that any achievement in the technological revolution means an increase in people's power to conquer nature; in production, the reform of a tool, the innovation of a process, and the improvement of a piece of equipment often increase labor efficiency by one, several, or even dozens of times. Moreover, with the development of technology, people will make more and more full use of materials. The recent promotion of advanced experiences such as gas generators in various parts of Jiangsu Province is a very obvious example. According to estimates in Wuxi City alone, the universal promotion of the experience of gasification can save 200,000 tons of coal a year. It can be seen from this that to rapidly develop production, we must vigorously engage in the technological revolution, and we cannot engage in it on a small scale. Only in this way can people's power to conquer nature be greatly increased rather than slightly increased. In the movement of the technological revolution, sticking to old ways, hesitating and shrinking back, worrying about "making a mess" and "not being able to end well," only wanting "small revolutions" and not daring to "big revolutions" is actually a problem of not believing in the great wisdom and creative talents of the masses. It is a problem of not wanting to build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically, and it runs counter to the spirit of the general line. If these ideological obstacles are not removed, they will inevitably affect the great development of the technological revolution.

    The essence of the ideological struggle in each of the above aspects is the struggle between advanced and backward, the struggle between collectivism and individualism, the struggle between communist ambition and various superstitious ideas and conditionalism, and also the struggle between the proletarian technical line and the bourgeois technical line. In the movement, we must adhere to putting politics in command, thoroughly criticize and overcome all kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas, clear the way for the development of the technological revolution, and transform our subjective world while transforming the objective world. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: "People's thinking must adapt to the changed situation." ("Preface to the Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside") "When a certain objective process has shifted from one stage of development to another, it is necessary to be good at making oneself and all those participating in the revolution also shift and transform in subjective understanding accordingly…The changes in the situation during the revolutionary period are very rapid. If the revolutionaries' understanding cannot change rapidly accordingly, they cannot lead the revolution to victory." ("On Practice") In the current new situation of the technological revolution, we should be vigilant not to let our thinking lag behind the development of the situation.

    Believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and deeply mobilize the masses.

    Science and technology come from the practice of the working masses, and the experience and wisdom of the working masses are always the source of the development of science and technology. The cause of science and technology can only be rapidly developed if it truly becomes the cause of the people. These have been repeatedly proven by a large number of facts in the technological revolution movement. We must resolutely believe that the creativity of the people is endless, rely closely on the masses, deeply mobilize the masses, and constantly promote the mass movement of the technological revolution forward. Our country is a country with a long cultural tradition of several thousand years. The broad masses of working people have accumulated extremely rich practical experience in production technology. As early as thousands of years ago, many great creators and inventors emerged, who made outstanding contributions to the progress of world science and technology. In the past one or two hundred years, due to the suffocation and destruction of the decadent feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism reactionary rule, China's science and technology only declined and stagnated, far behind the Western countries. Today, the potential of the liberated Chinese people to develop science and technology is incomparably huge. The practical experience and wisdom contained in the broad masses of the people, which are being increasingly promoted and carried forward, will become a great and unstoppable force for promoting China's science and technology. Relying on such people, and carrying out mass movements on a large scale in the technological revolution, will surely open up a new path for the development of science and technology that is more, faster, better, and more economical. But there are still some people who blindly believe in foreign experts, blindly believe in foreign methods, look down on indigenous methods, and look down on the inventions and creations of the masses, which is obviously wrong. They do not realize that the widespread adoption of indigenous methods can not only mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses to the fullest extent and greatly accelerate the speed of the technological revolution, but also that indigenous methods themselves are not the same as what was understood in the past, which are all some primary, simple, and transitional things. Among them, many seem simple, but are actually native-born scientific and latest technologies, are the cutting edge of current world science and technology, and are a new creation with a unique style. We can fully predict that as long as we adhere to the thorough mass line in the development of science and technology, mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the people to the fullest extent, we will be able to establish a new scientific line on the basis of modern science and technology, open up new scientific fields, create new scientific theories, and cultivate a large number of new scientists and inventors.

    To extensively carry out the technological revolution movement, it is necessary to adhere to the policy of combining popularization with improvement. Popularization and improvement are closely related and inseparable. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "Popularization work and improvement work cannot be completely separated." "Our improvement is improvement on the basis of popularization; our popularization is popularization under the guidance of improvement." Only by combining popularization and improvement in this way can we mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the people to the fullest extent and promote the technological revolution movement to develop from low to high and continuously forward. In this movement, all parts of Jiangsu have adopted the method of "grasping the stars in the sky with one hand and grasping the high, precise, and sharp with the other hand," which not only enables every corner of the province's urban and rural areas to proceed from its own realistic conditions and engage in mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation on a large scale, setting off an unprecedented scientific and technological popularization movement in history, but also vigorously carries out a mass movement centered on actively developing the radio instrument and instrument industry in several major cities and marching towards the high, precise, and sharp. Under the slogan of "every industry has its cutting edge, every factory has its famous brand, and everything has its own characteristics," all localities actively trial-produce new products and adopt new technologies. Various inventions and creations are like a rising wind and surging clouds, and everywhere is full of spring, and the entire production technology is developing towards a higher level. In this way, the development of high, precise, and sharp drives the improvement of general products, and the improvement of general products promotes the further development of high, precise, and sharp. This not only powerfully promotes the current development of production, but also adapts to the long-term requirements of the technological transformation of the entire national economy. The close relationship and inseparable relationship between popularization and improvement are also manifested as the relationship between quantitative change and qualitative change. In this mass movement of mechanization and automation by the whole people, some factories have suddenly changed from the original manual operation to the use of mechanical operation, and some workshops have fully realized automation. As far as this factory or this workshop is concerned, this is a great improvement, and it is a qualitative change in production technology. To go further, if the improvement of a factory is popularized in the entire industry, it will cause a qualitative change in the entire industry, and if it is popularized in the entire region, it will cause a qualitative change in the entire region. In the technological revolution movement, popularization, improvement, re-popularization, and re-improvement are carried out in this way, repeatedly cycling and continuously advancing, until infinity, so that the development of production technology develops from simple to refined, from rough to sharp, and from incomplete to gradually complete; so that the individual and local advanced levels are constantly transformed into the levels of the entire industry and even the entire society, thereby promoting the continuous improvement of the production technology level of the entire society.

    To make the technological revolution a cause of the broad masses, it is also necessary to adhere to the policy of walking on two legs, adhere to self-reliance, combine indigenous methods with foreign methods, and give priority to indigenous methods, and gradually improve them. Facts have proved that walking on two legs, simultaneously promoting indigenous and foreign methods, is a high-speed path for developing the technological revolution, and indigenous methods have unlimited vitality. Adhering to giving priority to indigenous methods will open up the broadest path for carrying out the "four modernizations" on a large scale. By doing this, we can attract the broad masses into the movement to the fullest extent and promote the technological revolution to develop more, faster, better, and more economically. In various parts of Jiangsu, the reason why many factories and mines were able to realize mechanization and automation in just a few days, creating a situation of rapid change in an instant, is also due to the adoption of this method of self-reliance and combining indigenous methods with foreign methods; many new equipment and new technologies have concentrated the wisdom and experience of the masses and continuously developed and improved along the path of indigenous methods, becoming high-level products and cutting-edge technologies with distinctive styles and unique families.

    To carry out comprehensive technological transformation of the national economy is a long-term task with strategic significance. Therefore, in the technological revolution movement, we need to have strategic thinking and formulate long-term plans according to the requirements of comprehensive technological transformation; at the same time, we must make battle deployments, implement them step by step, and closely link each link. In each battle, we must also study specific tactical problems, determine the center, make comprehensive arrangements, have clear slogans and clear goals; we must set projects, set indicators, set schedules, and set measures; and have special line leadership and special personnel to command. Between battles, we must promptly do a good job in inspection, summarization, promotion, and consolidation and improvement, so that the movement can continue to develop in one wave after another. In this technological revolution movement, various parts of Jiangsu generally adopted the following methods in leadership: overall planning, short-term arrangements, batch assaults, limited-time implementation, grasping a center in one period, and one assault after another. In this way, the principles of combining long-term and current, combining key points and general, and combining regular and assault are embodied, and thus it is possible to mobilize the people to the fullest extent and powerfully guarantee the continuous development of the technological revolution movement. In short, the technological revolution movement is a comprehensive and profound revolutionary movement, which requires us to lead this revolutionary mass movement with revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods.

    Continuously improve the level of enterprise management and reform unreasonable rules and regulations.

    The process of technological revolution and technological innovation is the process of new technology replacing old technology; and the transformation of production technology will inevitably disrupt the original set of production organization and labor organization, and break through some inapplicable rules and regulations. In order to adapt to the development of the technological revolution, we must continue to reform enterprise management. That is to say, the development of the technological revolution inevitably requires that some aspects of the superstructure and the relations of production must also be reformed in order to meet the needs of the development of productive forces and greatly promote the development of productive forces.

    Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, enterprise management work has established a set of management systems that are basically suitable for socialist modernized enterprises under the leadership of the Party and on the basis of large-scale mass movements, which has powerfully promoted the mass movement of enterprises and the Great Leap Forward in production. However, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": In socialist construction, there are often situations of both adaptation and contradiction between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base. In the current technological revolution movement, due to the rapid development of productive forces, if the enterprise management system cannot be changed correspondingly and rapidly, the situation of "mutual contradiction" will become prominent. Therefore, the task of the leadership is to grasp the technological revolution and also to grasp the innovation of the enterprise management system, and constantly resolve the contradictions between the productive forces and the relations of production, and between the superstructure and the economic base, in order to promote the rapid development of socialist construction.

    At present, the contradiction is very prominent in terms of labor organization. For example, in some factories, after a large number of automatic lines and assembly lines are organized, many processes and types of work are combined together. Therefore, the method of dividing groups according to the type of work in the past is no longer suitable for production organization. Even some sections need to be changed to groups, some workshops need to be changed to sections, and some factories may even need to be changed to a workshop or a section. Therefore, the original production organization and labor organization must be continuously adjusted in order to adapt to the development of the technological revolution, thereby promoting the development of production. After the first workshop and the fourth workshop of the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory formed several automatic lines, they changed the production organization in a timely manner, established joint groups including multiple types of work, basically realized the closed production of parts and components, and accelerated the progress of processing. In terms of rules and regulations, it is also necessary to continue to break the old and establish the new. In the technological revolution movement, it is wrong to ignore the importance of rules and regulations and think that engaging in the technological revolution on a large scale can do without rules and regulations; however, it is even more wrong if we do not continuously improve those rules and regulations that are no longer suitable with the development of mass movements and the improvement of production technology. This will restrain the hands and feet of the masses and suppress the lively and creative spirit of the masses. In other management work, such as production planning, production scheduling, product inspection, cost accounting, labor wages, process design, working hour quota, operating procedures, safety production, equipment maintenance, etc., a series of changes will be triggered, and reforms and revisions must be carried out. While reforming management methods and management systems, we must also pay attention to innovating and adopting advanced management tools. For example, adopting rapid calculation tools, automatic indicators, inspection devices, and electrified transmission and communication, strive for high efficiency in enterprise management work, so that management work can further adapt to the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production on the basis of vigorously engaging in mass movements and "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." In short, with the in-depth development of the technological revolution, new contradictions will inevitably continue to emerge in enterprise production, and the continuous revolution in enterprise organization is inevitable.

    In the face of these contradictions, what attitude should we take? Chairman Mao pointed out: "Contradictions constantly emerge and are constantly resolved. This is the dialectical law of the development of things.” ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") We must follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, grasp this law, adhere to continuous revolution, and, as some workers have proposed: "Continuously resolve new contradictions, and the revolution will reach a higher level." At the same time, we should adhere to the Party's mass line, adhere to the implementation of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," further promote the style of leaders contacting the masses and going deep into reality, adopt a positive and balanced attitude towards the various new contradictions exposed in enterprise management, carry out concrete queuing analysis, distinguish between primary and secondary, urgent and slow, propose reform plans, and mobilize and rely on the masses to solve them. We must be good at grasping advanced seedlings, supporting new things, especially grasping weak links, and constantly reforming enterprise management and rules and regulations, comprehensively improving the level of management, in order to consolidate and expand the achievements of the technological revolution movement and ensure the sustained leap forward in production.

    The Technological Revolution Must Be Combined with the Cultural Revolution.

    The technological revolution and the cultural revolution are interconnected and complementary. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably emerge." ("Opening Address at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference") At present, due to the extensive and in-depth development of the technological revolution movement, the contradiction between the cultural and scientific level of the broad masses of the working people and the requirements of the development of production technology is becoming increasingly prominent. After manual operation is changed to the use of mechanical operation, people are required not only to understand production, but also to learn to adjust and repair machines. After further realization of automation, people are also required to have scientific knowledge of electricity, radio, etc., and to be able to do many things at the same time, and be able to master the technology of several types of work and more extensive management experience. Therefore, the more production technology develops, the more it requires people to have more cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge. Only by extensively carrying out the cultural revolution can we consolidate the fruits of the technological revolution and greatly promote the further development of the technological revolution. As some employees said: "Technology is a treasure, but you can't learn it without culture." It can be seen from this that rapidly improving the cultural and scientific level of the working people is of great significance for the consolidation, improvement, and sustained development of the technological revolution movement. This requires us to launch a higher high tide of technological revolution while also pushing the cultural revolution to a new peak.

    Extensively carrying out the cultural revolution movement is not only an urgent need for current production and construction, but also related to the issue of the future transition to communism. To intellectualize the working people and to make the intellectuals become working people is the path to eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor. The elimination of this difference, like the elimination of the difference between workers and peasants and the difference between urban and rural areas, is necessary for the transition to communism. To carry out the cultural revolution, we must also have communist ambitions. How much ambition is established in the technological revolution, how much ambition must be established in the cultural revolution. Only in this way can the cultural revolution adapt to and promote the high-speed development of the technological revolution. Today, it can be said that mankind's understanding of nature is still in its primary stage. There are many natural phenomena that have not yet been scientifically explained, which shows that "there is no end to learning." We cannot learn all the knowledge in the world in our lifetime. To realize the great ambition of transforming the world and conquering nature, we must establish the idea of continuous revolution in the cultural revolution, never be satisfied with the status quo, and continue to learn and improve. Only by continuously developing cultural and educational undertakings and greatly improving the cultural and scientific level of the people can we accelerate the construction of socialism and create conditions for the transition to communism.

    At present, the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution is surging across the country with an overwhelming force. This urban and rural economic and technological revolution movement has opened the prelude to China's great technological revolution in the 1960s. This great movement is developing along a correct, scientific, and national path at a speed that is incomparable to the capitalist world. There is no doubt that this great movement will Greatly accelerate the process of building our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture.

    提高思想认识，加速城乡经济技术革命运动
    中共江苏省委书记处书记　许家屯
    技术革命运动的新高潮，是我国政治经济发展的必然产物
    我国的社会主义建设已经进入了高速度发展的新阶段。一个伟大的马克思列宁主义的城乡经济技术革命运动出现了。就江苏省范围来说，这个运动已经发展为一个全民性的革命运动。这个运动的来势之猛，范围之广，影响之深，效果之大，都是前所未有的。到处出现了钳工丢锉刀，锻工抛大锤，建筑工地群“龙”飞舞扬威，车站码头消灭肩挑人抬，稻田插秧不弯腰，银行点钞不用手，食堂切菜不用刀，豆腐店里赶走小毛驴的动人景象。人们还大大地破除了对科学技术的神秘观点，大搞自动化半自动化，大力试制新产品，发展新技术，采用新工艺，革新产品设计，开展科学研究，昂首阔步地向着世界科学技术高峰前进。根据南京、无锡等六个城市的统计，今年以来的三个月中，实现生产自动线八百一十一条，生产流水线二千八百六十七条，自动化单机七千六百八十三台，自动化车间、工段、小组八百三十三个，节约出劳动力六万九千四百十三人。此外，还试制成功新产品一万三千九百三十种，其中有不少产品已达到国内外的先进水平。现在，全省生产技术面貌正在发生深刻的变化。
    技术革命运动新高潮的出现，是我国政治经济发展的必然趋势，是在党的领导下，贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线、实现大跃进、发展人民公社的必然产物。这个新的形势，集中地反映了广大人民群众要求迅速改变我国经济、文化面貌的强烈愿望和高度自信心。人民群众的这种愿望和自信心，在社会主义的制度下，就必然要表现为积极的行动。特别是在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，人们的精神面貌经常在发生深刻的变化，共产主义觉悟不断地在提高。在经济上、政治上、思想上和精神上获得解放的劳动人民，其全部意志和力量必然日益集中地汇集到加速建设社会主义、并为向共产主义过渡创造条件这样一个伟大目标上面来，而大搞技术革命和文化革命，也就自然而然地成为广大人民群众的迫切要求和自觉的行动。毛泽东同志在1958年向全党全民发出了破除迷信、解放思想、发扬敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格的伟大号召，既反映了人民群众的心愿，也给予人民群众以极大的鼓舞和无比的动力。由于毛泽东思想深入人心，党的总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针深入人心，广大人民群众更加热情奔放，精神焕发，顽强钻研，大胆创造，因而在技术革命方面，就出现了日新月异的灿烂景象。我们必须认真地学习毛泽东思想，坚持不断革命的精神，进一步广泛深入地开展城乡经济技术革命运动。
    开展技术革命运动，必须坚持政治挂帅
    技术革新和技术革命的过程，是人们认识自然、征服自然的过程，也是人们改造自己的思想的过程。在阶级社会中，人们向自然界的斗争总是同社会的阶级斗争紧密关连的；就是在阶级消灭之后，人和自然的斗争也将自始至终地和人与人之间的思想斗争紧密联系在一起，如新与旧、先进与落后、科学与迷信这些思想的斗争。技术革命是通过人来进行的，因而必须不断解决人们思想上的矛盾，提高人们的认识。毛泽东同志说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”（“中国农村的社会主义高潮”按语）只有把政治工作和思想工作作为灵魂和统帅，才能使技术革命不断地向前发展，获得新的成就，达到新的高峰。
    二十世纪的六十年代，将是人类在科学技术方面放出更大异彩的年代。今天，标志着人类进一步认识和改造自然的重大的科学技术的新课题，如实现生产的全盘自动化，利用核聚变动力，研究生命过程的奥秘，探索宇宙空间，等等，只有在社会主义国家才能得到迅速发展，并应用于造福人类的目的。先进的科学技术事业永远是属于新生的阶级，属于先进的社会制度的。社会历史发展到今天，资本主义制度已经成为科学技术进步的桎梏。人类进一步改造世界、征服自然的伟大使命，必然是落在无产阶级的肩上。现代科学技术的大发展，必然要出现于社会主义制度下革命实践最丰富、理论思想最活跃的地方。迷信资本主义的技术理论、技术路线，妄自菲薄，墨守成规，总是不敢放大步子走路，对群众的创造发明不支持：这是资产阶级世界观没有得到根本改造，缺乏无产阶级的雄心大志的表现。我们作为无产阶级的革命者，就应当自觉地提高共产主义觉悟，加强无产阶级改造世界的责任心和自信心，满怀壮志，坚韧不拔，勇于实践，勇于创造。
    要改造自然，首先必须认识自然。自然是完全可以认识的，这一点必须肯定，否则就要陷入不可知论的泥坑。但是，也应该承认，今天人类对自然的认识还非常有限，这就影响到人类进一步的征服自然。为了加快对自然的改造，就需要加快对自然的认识。这就要求我们要不断破除迷信，解放思想，要敢想敢干，高速度地提高对自然界的认识。技术革命的运动，是人们的思想不断解放的运动，也是人们不断提高对自然的认识，从而不断改造自然的运动，人们思想解放了，认识提高了，也就会促进技术革命的发展。但是，有一些人没有认清这一点，往往是思想闭塞，坐井观天，一有成绩就自满起来，自认为已经达到了国内外先进水平，于是“到此为止”，故步自封，裹足不前。就当前来看，我们虽然在技术革命方面获得了很大的成就，但是技术的发展是永无止境的，我们过去的工作只不过像万里长征走完了第一步。因此，我们在技术革命上，必须牢固地确立不断革命的思想，百折不挠，永远向前。
    我们进行革命和建设的根本目的，是为了彻底解放生产力，推动社会生产的不断发展，从而满足人民群众日益增长的物质生活和文化生活的需要。而技术革命的过程，也就是进一步提高生产力和更加多快好省的发展生产的过程。无数的事实证明，技术革命中的任何成就，都意味着人们征服自然力量的增强；在生产上，一项工具的改革，一道工序的革新，一台设备的改进，往往要提高劳动效率一倍、几倍以至几十倍。而且，随着技术的发展，人们对物质的利用也会越来越充分。最近江苏省各地推广煤气发生炉等先进经验，就是十分明显的例证。仅就无锡一市推算，普遍推广煤气化这项经验，一年就可节约用煤二十万吨。由此可见，要迅速发展生产，必须大闹技术革命，而不能小闹，这样才能使人们征服自然的力量大增强而不是小增强。在技术革命运动中，因循守旧，犹豫畏缩，担心“搞乱”“不好收场”，只想“小革命”，不敢“大革命”，这实际上是不相信群众的伟大智慧和创造才能的问题，是不要多快好省建设社会主义的问题，是与总路线精神背道而驰的。这些思想障碍如果不扫除，也就必然要影响到技术革命的大发展。
    上述每一个方面的思想斗争的实质，是先进与落后之间的斗争，是集体主义与个人主义之间的斗争，是共产主义雄心大志与各种迷信思想、唯条件论之间的斗争，也是无产阶级的技术路线与资产阶级的技术路线之间的斗争。我们在运动中，必须坚持政治挂帅，彻底批判和克服形形色色的右倾保守思想，为技术革命的发展扫清道路，并在改造客观世界的过程中，同时改造自己的主观世界。毛泽东同志指示我们：“人们的思想必须适应已经变化了的情况。”（“中国农村的社会主义高潮”序言）“当某一客观过程已经从某一发展阶段向另一发展阶段推移转变的时候，须得善于使自己和参加革命的一切人员在主观认识上也跟着推移转变，……革命时期情况的变化是很急速的，如果革命党人的认识不能随之而急速变化，就不能引导革命走向胜利。”（“实践论”）在当前技术革命的新形势下，我们应当警惕使自己的思想不要落后于形势的发展。
    相信群众，依靠群众，深入发动群众
    科学技术来自劳动群众的实践，劳动群众的经验和智慧永远是科学技术发展的泉源。科学技术事业，只有真正成为人民群众的事业，才能获得迅速的发展。这些，都为技术革命运动中的大量事实所一再证明。我们必须坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，紧紧依靠群众，深入发动群众，把技术革命的群众运动不断地向前推进。我们国家是一个具有几千年悠久文化传统的国家，广大劳动人民在生产技术上积累了极为丰富的实践经验，早在千百年前，就出现过许多伟大的创造家和发明家，曾经为世界科学技术的进步作出了杰出的贡献。近一、二百年来，由于没落的封建主义和官僚资本主义反动统治的窒息和摧残，我国的科学技术事业才一蹶不振，停滞不前，远落在西方国家的后面。今天，解放了的我国人民发展科学技术的潜力是无比巨大的。广大群众中蕴藏着的实践经验和智慧，日益发扬光大起来，就会成为推进我国科学技术事业的伟大的、不可阻挡的力量。我们依靠了这样的人民群众，在技术革命中大搞群众运动，必将为科学技术的发展，打开一条新的多快好省的道路。但是还有一些人，迷信洋专家，迷信洋办法，看不起土办法，看不起群众的发明创造，这显然是错误的。他们没有认识到，广泛地采用土办法，不仅可以最充分地调动广大群众的积极性，大大加速技术革命的速度，而且土办法本身，也并不同于过去所理解的那样，都是一些初级的、简易的、过渡性质的东西，其中有不少看来简单，实际是土生土长的科学的最新技术，是当前世界科学技术的尖端，是一种具有独特风格的新创造。我们完全可以预计：只要在发展科学技术上坚持彻底的群众路线，最充分地把人民群众的积极性和创造性动员起来，我们就一定能够在现代科学技术水平的基础上，建立新的科学路线，开拓新的科学领域，创立新的科学理论，并培养出大批的新的科学家和发明家。
    广泛地开展技术革命运动，必须坚持普及和提高相结合的方针。普及和提高，这是密切联系、不可分割的。毛泽东同志曾经指出：“普及工作和提高工作是不能截然分开的”，“我们的提高，是在普及基础上的提高；我们的普及，是在提高指导下的普及。”只有这样的把普及和提高结合起来，才能够最充分地把人民群众的积极性和创造性动员起来，促使技术革命运动由低到高、持续不断地向前发展。在这次运动中，江苏各地都采取了“一手抓满天星，一手抓高精尖”的办法，既使全省城乡的每个角落都从自己的现实条件出发，大搞机械化半机械化和自动化半自动化，掀起了历史上罕见的科学技术普及运动；也在几个主要城市中蓬勃地开展了一个以积极发展无线电仪器仪表工业为中心、向高精尖进军的群众运动。各地在“行行有尖端，厂厂有名牌，样样有特色”的口号下，积极试制新产品，采用新技术，各种创造发明犹如风起云涌，到处是满园春色，整个生产技术正向着更高的水平发展。这样，高精尖的发展，带动了一般产品的提高，而一般产品的提高，又促进了高精尖进一步的发展。这不仅有力地促进了当前生产的发展，而且与整个国民经济技术改造的长远要求也是适应的。普及和提高的密切联系、不可分割的关系，也表现为量变和质变的关系。在这次全民大搞机械化、自动化的运动中，有的厂从原来的手工操作突变为使用机械操作，有的车间全部实现了自动化。就这个厂或这个车间来说，这就是一个大提高，就是生产技术上质的变化。再进一步说，一个厂的提高，如果在整个行业中加以普及，就会引起全行业的质的变化，如果在整个地区中加以普及，就会引起全地区的质的变化。在技术革命运动中，就是这样普及，提高，再普及，再提高，反复循环，不断前进，以至无穷，使生产技术的发展，由简到精，由粗到尖，由不完备逐渐到完备；使个别的、局部的先进水平不断地变为全行业以至全社会的水平，从而促使整个社会的生产技术水平不断地提高。
    要使技术革命成为广大群众的事业，还必须坚持两条腿走路的方针，坚持自力更生，土洋结合，以土为主，逐步提高。事实证明：用两条腿走路，土法和洋法同时并举，这是一条高速度发展技术革命的途径，而且，土办法具有无限的生命力，坚持了以土为主，就会为大搞“四化”开辟出最广阔的道路。这样做了，就能够最充分地把广大群众吸引到运动中来，促使技术革命更加多快好省地发展。在江苏各地，许多厂矿企业所以能够在短短几天内实现机械化、自动化，造成瞬息之间，变化万千的局面，也都是由于采取了这种自力更生、土洋结合的办法；有许多新设备、新技术，就是集中了群众的智慧和经验，沿着土办法的道路，不断地发展提高，成为别具风格、自成一家的高级产品、尖端技术。
    对国民经济进行全面的技术改造，是一个带有战略性的长期任务。因此，在技术革命的运动中，需要具有战略思想，根据全面技术改造的要求，制定长期的规划；同时，又要作出战役部署，步步落实，环环扣紧。在每个战役中，还要研究具体的战术问题，确定中心，全面安排，有响亮的口号，有明确的目标；要定项目、定指标、定进度、定措施；并有专线领导，专人指挥。在战役与战役之间，要及时做好检查、总结、促进和巩固提高的工作，使运动一浪高一浪地持续发展。在这次技术革命运动中，江苏各地在领导方法上，一般都采取：全面规划，短期安排，分批突击，限期实现，一个时期抓一个中心，一次突击接一次突击。这样，就体现了长远与当前相结合、重点与一般相结合、经常与突击相结合的原则，因而也就能够最充分地动员人民群众，有力地保证了技术革命运动持续不断地向前发展。总之，技术革命运动是一个全面的、深刻的革命运动，这就要求我们以革命的气魄，用革命的方法，来领导这个革命的群众运动。
    不断提高企业管理水平，改革不合理的规章制度
    技术革命和技术革新的过程，是新技术代替旧技术的过程；而生产技术的变革，必然要打乱原来的一套生产组织和劳动组织，要冲破一些不适用的规章制度。为了适应技术革命的发展，就必须继续不断地改革企业管理。这也就是说，技术革命的发展，势必要求上层建筑和生产关系的某些方面也要进行改革，才能适应生产力发展的需要和大大推动生产力的发展。
    1958年大跃进以来，企业管理工作在党的领导下和大搞群众运动的基础上，建立了一套基本适合于社会主义现代化企业的管理制度，有力地推动了企业的群众运动和生产的大跃进。但是，正像毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中指出的：在社会主义建设中，在生产关系和生产力之间，在上层建筑与经济基础之间经常存在着又相适应又相矛盾的情况。而在当前的技术革命运动中由于生产力的迅速发展，如果企业管理制度还不能作相应的迅速的改变，“又相矛盾”的情况，就会变得突出起来。因而，领导的任务，就要在抓技术革命的同时，也要抓企业管理制度的革新，不断解决生产力和生产关系之间、上层建筑与经济基础之间的矛盾，以便推动社会主义建设的迅速发展。
    目前，在劳动组织方面，矛盾是十分突出的，例如有些工厂，在大量组织起自动线、流水线生产之后，有许多工序、工种被组合在一起，因而生产组织上过去按工种划分小组的方法就不适应了，甚至有的工段要改变为小组，有的车间要改变为工段，有的工厂也可能要变成一个车间或者一个工段。因此，原来的生产组织和劳动组织只有不断地加以调整，才能与技术革命的发展相适应，从而促进生产的发展。南京机床厂第一车间和第四车间组成几条自动线后，他们及时地改变了生产组织，建立了包括多工种的联合小组，基本上实现了零件、部件的封闭生产，就加快了加工的进度。在规章制度方面，也必须继续不断地破旧立新。在技术革命运动中，忽视规章制度的重要性，认为大搞技术革命就可以不要规章制度了，这是不对的；但是，如果不随着群众运动的发展和生产技术的提高，不断改进那些已经不适应了的规章制度，就更加错误了。这就会束缚群众的手脚，抑制群众生动活泼的创造精神。在其他管理工作方面，如生产计划、生产调度、产品检验、成本核算、劳动工资、工艺设计、工时定额、操作规程、安全生产、设备检修等等，都要引起一系列的变化，必须进行改革和修订。在改革管理方法、管理制度的同时，也要注意革新和采用先进的管理工具。比如，采用速算工具、自动指示、检验器、传递联系电气化等等，力争企业管理工作高效率，使管理工作能在大搞群众运动和“两参一改三结合”的基础上，进一步适应生产大跃进的需要。总之，随着技术革命的深入发展，企业生产上必然要不断出现新的矛盾，企业组织上的不断革命是势在必行的。
    在这些矛盾面前，我们应当采取什么态度呢？毛主席指出：“矛盾不断出现，又不断解决，就是事物发展的辩证规律。”（“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）我们必须遵循毛泽东同志的指示，掌握这个规律，坚持不断革命，像有的工人提出的：“不断解决新矛盾，革命更上一层楼。”同时，应当坚持党的群众路线，坚持实行“两参一改三结合”，更加发扬领导联系群众、深入实际的作风，对于企业管理上暴露出来的各种新的矛盾，采取积极平衡的态度，进行具体的排队分析，分清主次缓急，提出改革方案，发动和依靠群众加以解决。要善于抓住先进苗头，支持新生事物，特别是要狠抓薄弱环节，不断地改革企业管理和规章制度，全面提高管理水平，以巩固和扩大技术革命运动的成果，保证生产的持续跃进。
    必须把技术革命和文化革命结合起来
    技术革命和文化革命是互相关联、相辅相成的。毛主席早就指出：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”（“中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议开幕词”）当前，由于技术革命运动广泛深入的开展，广大劳动人民的文化科学水平与生产技术发展的要求不相适应的矛盾就日益突出。在手工操作改为使用机械操作之后，就要求人们不仅要懂得生产，而且要学会调整、检修机器。在进一步实现自动化之后，还要求人们要具有电气、无线电等科学知识，并做到一人多艺，能够同时掌握几个工种的技术和更广泛的管理经验。因此，生产技术越是向前发展，就越是要求人们有更多的文化科学技术知识，只有把文化革命广泛地开展起来，才能巩固技术革命的果实，才能大大促进技术革命的进一步发展。正如有的职工说：“技术是个宝，没有文化学不了。”由此可见，迅速提高劳动人民的文化科学水平，对于技术革命运动的巩固提高和持续发展，具有十分重大的意义，这就要求我们在掀起一个更高的技术革命高潮的同时，把文化革命也推向一个新的高峰。
    广泛开展文化革命运动，不仅是当前生产建设的迫切需要，而且关系到将来向共产主义过渡的问题。劳动人民知识化，知识分子劳动化，是消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别的途径，这种差别的消灭，和工农之间的差别，城乡之间的差别的消灭一样，为向共产主义过渡所必需。进行文化革命，也要具有共产主义的雄心大志。技术革命上立多大的志，文化革命上就要立多大的志，这才能使文化革命适应并促进技术革命的高速度发展。今天，人类对于自然界的认识，可以说还是处在初级的阶段，有许多自然现象还得不到科学的解释，这就可见“学无止境”，世界上的学问是我们一生学不完的。我们要实现改造世界、征服自然的伟大抱负，就必须在文化革命上确立不断革命的思想，永远不满足现状，不断学习，不断提高。也只有不断发展文化教育事业，大大提高人民群众的文化科学水平，才能够加速建设社会主义，并为过渡到共产主义创造条件。
    当前，技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，正以排山倒海之势，磅礴于全国各地，这一城乡经济技术革命运动，揭开了六十年代我国技术大革命的序幕。这个伟大的运动正沿着正确的、科学的、全民的轨道，以资本主义世界不可比拟的速度向前发展。毫无疑问，这个伟大的运动，必将大大加速把我国建成具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家的过程。
