Comrades Chairman and Representatives:

　　We fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget draft, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. We all express boundless enthusiasm and confidence in contributing our utmost to overfulfilling the 1960 National Economic Plan and achieving an even greater, faster, better, and more economical continued Great Leap Forward.

　　We are all workers on the petroleum industry front. We deeply understand that the petroleum industry in our motherland is a sector that started almost from scratch after liberation, a weak link that is being vigorously strengthened. Rapid development is not without difficulties. However, under the radiant light of the General Line, petroleum workers nationwide, brimming with energy and striving for the top, have demonstrated tremendous initiative and creativity to shake off the backward state of the petroleum industry as soon as possible, and have achieved many unprecedented miracles. Our petroleum geological exploration work has the characteristics of high drilling speed, low cost, and great effectiveness. In 1958, our exploratory well success rate reached 72%. The average exploratory well success rate in the United States from 1944 to 1957 was only 19.7%, and it dropped to 19.5% in 1958. We have far surpassed the speed of the United States. Judging from the increase in crude oil production per meter of drilling, we increased net crude oil production by 722 kilograms per meter of well drilled (including exploratory and production wells) in the ten years from 1950 to 1959. Of these, 782 kilograms were added in 1958 and 1959 alone, while the United States only increased net crude oil production by 144 kilograms per meter of well drilled in the twelve years from 1947 to 1958, four times lower than our figures. The speed of our oilfield construction work is also astonishing, especially in the high-yield Lenghu Oilfield in Qinghai. Oil was first discovered in September 1958. In 1959, starting from scratch on a desolate Gobi Desert with no inhabitants, a relatively complete oilfield base with initial scale was established within five months, including oil extraction, oil transportation, gas transportation, power generation, refining plants, civil construction, etc. (It took the Yumen Oil Mine sixteen years to build an oilfield base of roughly the same scale in the past.) Such leaping construction speed can only be achieved in the era of Mao Zedong. Our petroleum workers are truly poor in possessions but rich in ambition and high in fighting spirit. In the expansion project of the Dushanzi Refinery in Xinjiang, using collaborative efforts, piecing things together, and using conservation and substitution methods, equipment originally capable of processing 250,000 tons of crude oil was expanded to handle over 1 million tons in just eleven months. In the construction project of the fourth, fifth, and third-section shale dry distillation furnaces in the Fushun No. 2 Petroleum Factory, 60% of the steel was used to complete 100% of the project, a year ahead of schedule, creating a model for building large-scale synthetic petroleum plants in a faster, better, more economical, and more cost-effective manner. In the production of synthetic petroleum, due to vigorous reforms in operational equipment and technology, increased processing volume, and improved shale utilization and oil recovery rates, production capacity has been greatly increased. The utilization of granular and powdered shale, which had not been resolved for a long time, has been basically resolved due to the successful research and design of new furnace types such as louver furnaces, square furnaces, solid heat carrier furnaces, and fluidized furnaces. Several oil mines successfully built non-metallic oil pools with oil storage capacity of over 100,000 tons in less than half a year. In recent years, the annual increase rate of crude oil has been above 40%, and it is expected to maintain high-speed growth in the future. The above achievements are tremendous. However, the current development of the petroleum industry still lags far behind the needs of the situation. We must make a hundredfold effort to catch up and change this backward situation with a new fighting posture.

　　We unanimously express our determination to the congress that we will hold high the red banner of the Party's General Line and Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to putting politics in command and the mass line, and contribute all our strength to resolutely guarantee the realization of the tasks proposed in the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, to complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party. This year, the crude oil production task plan for the petroleum industry is 5.2 million tons, an increase of 41% over last year. We have full confidence and determination to ensure that we can overfulfill the above target figure. Under the guidance of the General Line, all our petroleum workers are carrying out a magnificent technical innovation and technical revolution movement. New people and new things are emerging endlessly. For example, the consumption of catalysts for catalytic cracking has been greatly reduced due to improved operation and control equipment, saving more than four times compared to the past. Furthermore, many useful chemical and medical products, such as phenol, pyridine, detergents, and insecticides, have been made from acid sludge, alkali sludge, and wastewater, which are generally considered "waste products." In addition, the loss rate has been greatly reduced during the crude oil processing process due to the addition of automatic control and improved operations, resulting in tens of thousands of tons of additional products each year. We must find oilfields in the fastest, most accurate, and most economical way, and we must make revolution in finding oil. We must find a method for developing oilfields that requires the least drilling, maximizes oil production, minimizes construction costs, and maximizes oil recovery rates, and we must make revolution in oil extraction. We must refine good oil, achieve high recovery rates, minimize losses, produce more products, reduce costs, ensure high quality, and utilize all by-products, including wastewater, to achieve "intensive cultivation, thorough utilization," and we must make revolution in oil refining. We must rely on self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, adopting foreign methods where possible, and using indigenous methods when foreign methods are not available, starting with indigenous methods and then adopting foreign methods, so that the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is pushed to new heights wave upon wave, with a surging and turbulent momentum!

　　At the same time, our petroleum industry has a particularly important task in supporting agriculture. In 1960, agricultural technical transformation will increase mechanical power by more than 5 million horsepower. If all this power is driven by internal combustion engines, the petroleum industry should be responsible for supplying 2.4 million tons of gasoline and diesel. In order to implement the principle of "agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor," and to rapidly develop agriculture, we must do everything possible to complete this task. In the past year or so, we have built a large number of small synthetic petroleum plants in various provinces and cities. We are currently continuing to build a new batch of medium and small-sized plants, whose production capacity will be equal to the output of large-scale synthetic petroleum plants in 1959. These small plants that combine indigenous and foreign methods will play a significant role in the development of the petroleum industry, especially in supporting agriculture. This proves that the Party's principle of walking on two legs is completely correct. In order to make local small oil plants even better, we must vigorously develop the comprehensive utilization of oil, coke, water, chemicals, and gas, centered on oil; at the same time, we must vigorously promote mechanization and semi-mechanization, reducing manual operators to less than 20% and greatly saving labor.

　　"At present, all cities across the country are vigorously running people's communes, vigorously running street industries, vigorously running suburban agriculture, vigorously running public welfare undertakings, vigorously running public canteens, and extensively organizing the economic life of residents, further organizing the urban people, and liberating tens of thousands of urban housewives from domestic labor to participate in social labor. All this is not only conducive to the development of production and construction, but also conducive to the thorough transformation of urban social life." We wholeheartedly support the establishment and development of urban people's communes. In recent years, through political study and on-site visits, we have fully proven that the people's communes have strong vitality and unparalleled superiority. Since the collectivization of urban life and production, the people have been tempered by collective life, living an organized and disciplined life, which has further enhanced communist ideology, prompting people to gradually change the private concepts and narrow-minded conservative ideas formed by past individual lifestyles, establish comrade-style equal and loving relationships and harmonious new families between people, and fundamentally change people's spiritual outlook. We deeply realize that only in the collective life of the people's commune can we change the old habits of intellectuals quickly and thoroughly. We eagerly look forward to the early realization of happy communism and celebrating the life of our highest political ideals.

　　The continued Great Leap Forward in 1959 completed the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. Facts have proven that the socialist construction General Line, embodied by Mao Zedong Thought, combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices of the Chinese revolution and construction, is invincible. Two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, and the comprehensive and better Great Leap Forward that will inevitably come in the future, have affirmed that the speed of the leap forward can be sustained for a long time, powerfully crushing the attacks of right-leaning opportunists, and also confirming the mistakes of doubters. In the victorious advance, there are definitely difficulties, but under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the unity of the people and holding high the red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, advancing shoulder to shoulder with the people of all nationalities across the country, and obtaining the support and cooperation of fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union, we have full confidence in overcoming any difficulties and victoriously completing the comprehensive tasks of the petroleum industry in the continued Great Leap Forward of 1960. We also have full confidence in developing the petroleum industry at high speed and high level, and in removing the backward label of the petroleum industry in the very near future, making outstanding achievements in socialist construction.

    高速度高水平地发展石油工业
    顾敬心　李风　张大煜　熊尚元代表赵宗燠　杨伟委员的发言主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意和衷心拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，和谭震林副总理关于为提前实现农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告。我们大家都怀着无比的热情和信心，为超额完成1960年的国民经济计划和一个更加多快好省的继续大跃进，贡献出最大的力量。
    我们都是石油工业战线上的工作者，我们深知祖国石油工业是解放后近乎白手起家的一个部门，是一个正在大力加强的薄弱环节，要迅速发展，不是没有困难的；但在总路线的光辉照耀下，全国石油工作者，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为早日摆脱石油工业落后状态，发挥了巨大的积极性与创造性，出现了许多史无前例的奇迹。我们石油地质勘探工作，具有钻速高，成本低，效果大的特点，1958年，我们的探井成功率达到72％，美国从1944年到1957年平均探井成功率仅为19.7％，1958年又降为19.5％，我们已远远地超过了美国的速度。从每米钻井所增加的原油产量看，我们1950年到1959年的十年内，每打一米井（包括探井和生产井）净增产原油七百二十二公斤。其中1958年和1959年两年为七百八十二公斤，而美国1947年到1958年的十二年中，每打一米井净增产原油只有一百四十四公斤，我们比美国高出四倍。我们油田建设工作的速度也是惊人的，特别是青海冷湖高产油田，1958年9月才见油，1959年开始在没有人烟，一片荒凉的戈壁滩上，平地起家，在五个月内建立起了一个初具规模、比较完备的油田基地，包括采油、输油、输气、发电炼厂、民用建筑等等（过去玉门油矿建成与此大体规模相同的油田基地，用了十六年之久的时间）。像这样飞跃的建设速度，只有在毛泽东时代，才能实现。我们石油工作者，真是人穷志大，斗志昂扬。在新疆独山子炼厂扩建工程中，仅用了短短十一个月的时间，采取协作配合、东拼西凑和节约代用等办法、由原来加工原油二十五万吨的设备，扩大到一百多万吨。在抚顺石油二厂四、五部三段页岩干馏炉建设工程中，以60％的钢材，完成了百分之百的工程，在时间方面，提前了一年，为多快好省地建设大规模的人造石油厂创造了一个范例。在人造石油生产方面，由于大力改革操作设备和技术，加大处理量，提高页岩利用率和采油率，使生产能力大大提高。长期没有得到解决的颗粒页岩和粉末页岩的利用，由于百叶窗炉，方型炉，固体热载体炉，流体化炉等新炉型研究和设计的成功，基本上获得了解决。几个油矿在不到半年的时间内，成功地建成了储油能力达十万余吨的非金属油池。几年来原油每年上升率一直在40％以上，预计今后也定能高速度的增长。以上成绩是巨大的。但目前石油工业的发展，还远远落后于形势的需要，我们必须要百倍努力，迎头赶上，以新的战斗姿态来改变这种落后面貌。
    我们一致向大会表示决心，我们一定要高举党的总路线和毛泽东思想的红旗，坚持政治挂帅，群众路线，为坚决保证实现李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理报告中所提出的各项任务，贡献出自己的一切力量，来完成党所交给我们的光荣任务。今年石油工业的原油生产任务计划为五百二十万吨，比去年增长41％，我们完全有信心，有决心，保证一定能够超额完成上项指标数字。我们全体石油工作者，在总路线的指引下，正在开展着波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动，新人新事，层出不穷，例如催化裂化的催化剂用量，由于改进了操作和控制设备，大量减少了损失，比过去节省了四倍以上。又如在一般认为是“废品”的酸渣，碱渣，污水中制成了酚、吡啶、洗涤剂、杀虫剂等很多有用的化学及医学用品。此外在原油加工过程中，由于增设自动控制改进操作以后，损失率大大降低，每年可白白多得产品几万吨。我们要用最快、最准、最省的办法来找到油田，要在找油上闹革命。要找出一个打井最少，采油最多，建设最省，采油率最高的开发油田的方法，要在采油上闹革命。要炼好油、收率高、损耗少、产品多、成本低、质量高，并且把全部副产品，包括污水都要利用，要做到“深耕细作，吃光榨尽”，要在炼油上闹革命。我们要依靠自力更生，土洋结合，能洋则洋，不能洋则土，先土后洋，使技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，一浪高于一浪，以风起云涌，奔腾澎湃之势，推向新的高潮！
    同时我们石油工业对支援农业方面，负有特别重要的任务，1960年农业技术改造将增加机械动力五百多万马力，如果这些动力全部用内燃机发动，石油工业就应当负起二百四十万吨的汽油和柴油的供应任务。为了贯彻“农业为基础，工业为主导”的方针，为了迅速发展农业，我们必须千方百计来完成这一任务。一年多来，我们在各省市已建成一大批小型人造石油厂，最近还在继续增建一批中小型厂，生产能力将与1959年大型人造石油厂的产量相等，这些土洋结合的小厂，将在石油工业的发展中发挥很大的作用，特别是对支援农业有重大的作用。这证明了党的两条腿走路的方针是完全正确的。为了使地方小型油厂搞得更好，必须大力发展以油为中心的油、焦、水、化、气五位一体的全面综合利用；同时要大搞机械化、半机械化，使手工操作人员降低到20％以内，大量节省劳动力。
    “现在，全国各城市正在大办人民公社，大办街道工业，大办郊区农业，大办公共福利事业，大办公共食堂，广泛地组织居民的经济生活，把城市人民进一步地组织起来，并且使成千成万的城市家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加社会劳动。这一切，不仅有利于生产建设的发展，而且有利于城市社会生活的彻底改造”。我们衷心地拥护城市人民公社的建立与发展。近年来我们经过政治学习和实地参观，已完全证明了人民公社具有强大的生命力和无比的优越性。从城市的生活和生产集体化以后，人民受到集体生活锻炼，过着有组织、有纪律的生活，这就进一步提高了共产主义思想，促使人们逐步改变过去个体生活方式所形成的私有观念和狭隘的保守思想，建立人与人之间的同志式的平等友爱关系和团结和睦的新家庭，使人们精神面貌发生了根本的变化。我们深切地认识到，只有在人民公社集体生活中，才能尽速地、彻底地改变知识分子的旧习气。我们热烈地期望着幸福的共产主义早日实现，欢度我们最高的政治理想的生活。
    1959年的继续大跃进，提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的任务。事实证明了，以马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想所体现的社会主义建设总路线，是无往而不胜的。连续二年大跃进，和今后必然而来的全面的更好的大跃进，肯定了跃进的速度是能够长期持续的，有力地粉碎了右倾机会主义分子的进攻，同时也证实了怀疑者的错误。在胜利前进道路中，困难是肯定有的，但在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，万众一心，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，与全国各民族人民并肩前进，并取得以苏联为首的兄弟国家支援和协作，我们完全有信心能够克服任何困难，胜利完成1960年继续大跃进的石油工业全面任务。我们也完全有信心，能够高速度高水平地发展石油工业，在很短的将来，就会摘掉石油工业落后的帽子，在社会主义建设中做出卓越的成绩。
