Medical Workers Should Face the People and Face Production
Speech by Committee Member Liang Yiwen

The Party has guided us medical workers to open up broader avenues of work, stepping out of hospital doors, going deep among the worker and peasant masses, going down to factories, down to the streets, and down to the countryside to deliver medical care, serving the working people, and serving production.

Fellow Committee Members:

I fully support Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s “Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960”; Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s “Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft”; and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong’s work report.

The continuous Great Leap Forward of the past two years has enabled our people to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and a great victory for the Party's three magic weapons: the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. The Great Leap Forward has caused major indicators such as steel and grain in our country to rise in a straight line. Such a high speed has never been seen in history. We have done things that capitalist countries cannot do, and powerfully countered the slander and defamation of imperialism.

The draft national economic plan for 1960 unfolds an even brighter prospect for our people. Through two years of practice, we have accumulated relatively rich experience. Relying on the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, we will surely be invincible and surely be able to complete the 1960 national economic plan ahead of schedule, so that we can leap forward again and again!

Before this conference, I, along with some National People's Congress representatives and CPPCC members from Guangdong Province, visited and inspected Henan Province. I saw the Hongqi People's Commune in Guancheng District, Zhengzhou City; the Zhengzhou Abrasive Wheel Factory and Textile Machinery Factory; the Luoyang No. 1 Tractor Factory, Bearing Factory, and Mining Machinery Factory; and the large-scale construction projects of the Yellow River Huayuankou and Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub. This made me deeply appreciate the brilliant achievements and bright prospects of the socialist construction of the motherland. It also made me further realize that the working people are the creators of history and wealth, and that guaranteeing the health of the working people is guaranteeing the construction strength of the motherland. The Party's call for medical workers to take on the task of serving the working people and serving production is completely correct. As a member of the construction team, how can we not be excited, happy, and full of energy as we sprint towards the broad road guided by the Party? I deeply feel that being able to dedicate my strength to serving the people under the leadership of the Party is the most glorious and meaningful thing in my life.

I have been engaged in medical work for more than 30 years. In my youth, did I not aspire to serve the vast number of patients? However, in the dark old society, under the influence of enslaved education, I always worked in hospitals run by American imperialism, and the objects of my service were mostly the bourgeoisie who exploited the working people. Thinking about it today, I am truly ashamed! Fortunately, we were liberated, and under the Party's education and cultivation, I clarified the direction of serving the people. Especially after the Great Leap Forward, the Party guided us to open up broader avenues of work, stepping out of hospital doors, going deep among the worker and peasant masses, conscientiously implementing the system of responsibility for areas centered on hospitals, actively carrying out preventive work, going down to factories, down to the streets, and down to the countryside to deliver medical care, serving the working people, and serving production. In the process of service, the noble communist style of the working people also educated us and strengthened our thinking of "everything for the patient."

In our hospital (Guangzhou Municipal Second People's Hospital), we also conscientiously implemented the policy of Chinese medicine and achieved certain results. In the face of the fact that some of our Western medicine workers have achieved remarkable therapeutic results with traditional Chinese medicine, they have completely reversed their past ideas of belittling traditional Chinese medicine and are eagerly requesting to learn from Chinese medicine. We have organized an amateur Chinese medicine university, and clinically we have also adopted the cooperation of Chinese and Western medicine and a large number of Chinese medicines, which has solved many diseases that Western medicine previously considered difficult to treat. We deeply appreciate the correctness of the Party's policies and principles on traditional Chinese medicine and recognize that inheriting and carrying forward the medical and cultural heritage of the motherland is our most glorious task.

In order to better cooperate with the Great Leap Forward in production, we have vigorously launched medical research work. For example, we are conducting investigations and research on gynecological uterine prolapse in order to find more effective prevention and treatment methods; we are also conducting general surveys of cervical cancer in order to diagnose and treat it as early as possible, thereby improving work efficiency and medical quality, and making medicine better serve workers, peasants, and production.

Because we put politics in command and gave full play to the spirit of communist cooperation, we rescued He Neijian, a female worker from a coking plant who suffered large-area burns. Her burn area was all second and third degree, with a total area of 82%. This is the largest area of burns in Guangzhou that has been successfully rescued in an unprecedented case. The Party committee and the branch personally took charge, and all the medical staff of the hospital gave full play to the spirit of great collaboration. Brother hospitals supported us with manpower and material resources, forming a treatment and nursing team that worked day and night to rescue her. Finally, she recovered her health and is now able to get out of bed and walk. In the past, we could only watch such casualties die, but today, with the Party and the communist style of great collaboration, and with the full play of the active role of medical workers, we have the power to bring the dead back to life.

These facts eloquently educate us and transform our old thinking. In the future, we should continue to transform ourselves, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stand on the proletarian stand, resolutely and unswervingly implement the Party's policies and principles; humbly learn from the masses, rely on the masses in medical work, collect experiences and prescriptions scattered among the masses; conscientiously implement the principle of combining Chinese and Western medicine, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, and strive to painstakingly study and carry out various medical scientific research; even if we encounter great difficulties in ideological transformation or technological innovation, we will never bow our heads, never be discouraged, forge ahead bravely, always follow the Party, and strive to transform ourselves into medical workers who are both red and expert, and create more and better achievements to repay the Party's cultivation and education!

    医务工作者要面向人民面向生产
    梁毅文委员的发言
    党指引我们医务工作者开辟了更广阔的工作道路，走出了医院大门，深入到工农群众中去，下工厂，下街道，下农村送医上门，为劳动人民服务，为生产服务。各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”；李先念副总理的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”；陈叔通副主席的工作报告。
    两年来的连续大跃进，使我国人民提前完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标，这是马克思列宁主义普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是党的三个法宝总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利。大跃进使我国钢铁粮食等主要指标直线上升，这样的高速度是历史上从来没有过的。我们作了资本主义国家所不能作到的事情，有力地回击了帝国主义的污蔑和诽谤。
    1960年的国民经济计划草案给我国人民展开了一幅更美好的前景。我们经过两年的实践，已经积累了比较丰富的经验。我们依靠着总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三大法宝，一定能够无往不胜，一定能够提前完成1960年的国民经济计划，使我们跃进再跃进！
    在这次大会之前，我曾与广东省一部分全国人民代表和政协委员到河南省参观视察，看到了郑州市管城区红旗人民公社，郑州市砂轮厂、纺织机械厂；洛阳第一拖拉机厂、轴承厂、矿山机械厂；黄河花园口和三门峡水利枢纽工程等规模巨大的建设项目。更使我深切体会到祖国社会主义建设辉煌成就和光辉远景。并使我进一步认识到劳动人民是历史和财富的创造者，保障劳动人民的健康，就是保障祖国的建设力量。党号召医务工作者负起面向劳动人民为生产服务的任务是完全正确的。我们作为建设队伍中的一份子，怎能不兴奋愉快、干劲冲天地向着党指引的康庄大道上飞奔呢？我自己深深感到我能够在党的领导下，献出自己的力量为人民服务，是我有生以来最光荣最有意义的事。
    我从事医务工作已三十多年，在年青时代何尝不立过为广大病人服务的志向呢？但在黑暗的旧社会里，在奴化教育的影响下，一向在美帝国主义办的医院中工作，服务的对象大部分是剥削劳动人民的资产阶级。今天想起来，真是问心有愧！幸而解放了，在党的教育培养下，明确了为谁服务的方向。尤其是在大跃进以后，党指引我们开辟了更广阔的工作道路，走出了医院大门，深入到工农群众中去，认真贯彻以医院为中心，积极开展地段负责制及扩大预防工作，下工厂、下街道、下农村，送医上门，为劳动人民服务，为生产服务。在服务的过程中，劳动人民的高尚的共产主义风格也教育了我们，加强了我们“一切为了病人”的思想。
    在我们医院（广州市立第二人民医院）内，也认真贯彻了中医政策，取得了一定成绩。我们一些西医工作者在中医中药取得显著疗效成绩的事实前，已彻底扭转了过去轻视中医中药的思想，都迫切要求向中医学习。我们组织了业余中医大学，临床上也采取中西医合作并大量应用中药，许多以前西医认为难治之症，都得以解决。我们深深体会到党对中医的方针政策的正确，认识到继承和发扬祖国医药文化遗产是我们最光荣的任务。
    为了更好地配合生产上的大跃进，我们大力展开了医学研究工作。例如我们对妇科子宫脱垂病进行调查研究，以便找出更有效的防治方法；又对子宫颈癌肿进行普查，使能及早诊断及早处理，从而提高了工作效率和医疗质量，使医学更好地为工农服务，为生产服务。
    由于我们政治挂帅，发挥了共产主义大协作精神，抢救了大面积烧伤的病人炼焦厂女工何内见。她的烧伤面积均为二、三度，总面积达82％。这是广州市最大面积烧伤而能救活的前所未有的病例。党委与支部亲自挂帅，全院医务人员发挥了大协作精神，各兄弟医院又以人力物力支持，组成治疗护理小组，不分昼夜，进行抢救，终于使她恢复了健康，现在她已能起床行走了。从前这样的伤员，我们只能眼看着她走向死亡，但今天有了党，有了大协作的共产主义风格，充分发挥了医务工作者的积极作用，我们就有了起死回生的力量。
    这些事实，雄辩地教育了我们，改造了我们的旧思想。今后，我们应该不断地继续改造自己，以毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，站稳无产阶级立场，坚决不移地贯彻党的方针政策；虚心向群众学习，在医疗工作上，依靠群众，收集散布在群众当中的经验和良方；认真执行中西结合，土洋并举的方针，千方百计地刻苦钻研，进行各种医学科学研究；在思想改造或技术革新中，即使遇到很大困难，也决不低头，决不气馁，奋勇向前，永远跟着党走，争取把自己改造成又红又专的医务工作者，创造出更多更好的成绩来报答党对我们的培养和教育！
