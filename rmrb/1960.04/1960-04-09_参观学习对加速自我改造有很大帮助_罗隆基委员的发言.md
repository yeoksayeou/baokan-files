Chairman, fellow committee members:

First of all, I express my sincere gratitude to the Party. I am grateful that the Party has continued to provide me, a person who has committed serious crimes, with various opportunities for learning in self-reform over the past few years, especially in the past year, giving me the opportunity to conduct practical study tours in many places outside Beijing. For example, in July 1959, I visited various cities in the three northeastern provinces to see the heavy industry construction projects; in December 1959, I visited Anyang, Henan, to see the large-scale steelmaking projects "from indigenous to foreign, combining indigenous and foreign methods"; and in March of this year, I visited emerging light and heavy industries in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and the large-scale water conservancy project in Danjiangkou. This series of field study tours has been of great and good help to my reform.

Through these visits, I have personally witnessed so many amazing miracles in the country's socialist construction, which undeniably proves that the General Line is absolutely wise and correct; the Great Leap Forward is the result of the high-speed and proportionate development of the country's various construction projects, and it will definitely continue to leap forward in the future; the People's Communes are increasingly showing great vitality, and their development has rapidly expanded from the countryside to many important cities, and they are bound to have a bright and brilliant future. All these glorious and great achievements fully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The reason why the country's socialist construction, especially in the past two or three years, has been able to achieve such a leaping progress is that it has truly realized political leadership, implemented the mass line and the "walking on two legs" policy under the strong leadership of the Party. This is Mao Zedong Thought, the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, which is the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the practice of China's socialist revolution and construction.

The above-mentioned points are already facts praised by the people of China in unison today, and there is no need for me to repeat and praise them here. Today, I only want to talk about the enlightenment and education I have received in recent study tours, combined with my own ideological situation, especially combined with my earnest desire for self-reform.

**Put politics in command, strengthen leadership, listen to the Party, follow the Party wholeheartedly, and always follow Chairman Mao**

First, from the study tours, I have further understood the true meaning of the two phrases "put politics in command and strengthen leadership," and I have more clearly recognized my past serious sins. In the past, I mistakenly thought that the Party's leadership was only political and ideological leadership, and in the implementation of socialism and communism, it was only the leadership of national policies and guidelines, only the leadership of general plans and general programs. Therefore, I thought that these were only the leadership of the Party's senior leaders. In the past, I thought that I was willing to listen to the words of the Party's senior leaders, and I thought that I had accepted the Party's leadership, so I arrogantly and ignorantly despised the Party's middle and lower-level leadership. After reflection, I realized that a person with deeply rooted bourgeois ideas like me could not wholeheartedly accept the Party's leadership before reform. From this study tour, I also realized that the Party's ideology, policies, and guidelines must be implemented through the leadership of the Party's grassroots. The grassroots cadres are the leaders who truly understand and grasp the Party's ideology, policies, and guidelines. Therefore, not accepting the leadership of the Party's middle and lower-level organizations is actually not accepting the Party's leadership, and it is rejecting political leadership. I personally saw that the Party's grassroots leaders are truly responsible for practical work. Their leadership method is not to point fingers, but to work hard. They truly maintain the noble qualities and lofty style of the Red Army tradition during the revolutionary war. They are always the pioneers in the work, leaving convenience to others and taking difficulties for themselves. For example, when the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Project in Hubei Province was constructing the cofferdam and closing the gap, the general commander of the project, who was already the secretary of the provincial party committee and the governor of the province, personally went into the water barefoot and directed the work with sweat. Isn't this leadership by personal example? Isn't this worthy of my admiration? When he spoke to our visiting group, he said, "We Communist Party cadres will not forget our roots," and the "roots" he referred to were the "roots" of going hungry, living in thatched huts, and going barefoot in the guerrilla war, the "roots" of crossing snow-capped mountains and walking through grasslands in the Long March. Therefore, he also said, "Look back on life, look forward to production." This is a truly meaningful and thought-provoking lesson for me. The example I cited is not an isolated case. Through the visit, I found that the Party's leading cadres in factories and communes almost all have such qualities and styles. They all have a sincere and simple attitude and a selfless spirit. They are responsible people for the cause, truly "worrying before the factory and commune, and enjoying after the factory and commune." Shouldn't we respect such leaders? The Chinese proverb says, "One must endure all hardships to become a man above men." In the study tour, I also realized that the Party's grassroots leading cadres are "enduring all hardships, but not becoming men above men." Because they "do not become men above men," they truly implement Chairman Mao's instruction to take the mass line. Chairman Mao once instructed in practice, "From the masses, to the masses," which mainly refers to the decision-making in work. I also have this understanding of the Party's grassroots leading cadres: they are "born truly from the masses, and always go to the masses for work." The leading cadres in factories and communes that I came into contact with during the visit were almost all selected from the workers and peasants based on their work performance, but they are still members of the workers and peasants in their work. Then, are such leading cadres "laymen leading experts" in terms of theoretical knowledge and technological skills? The facts have thoroughly refuted my previous absurd class prejudices as a ideologically backward person. They are people who come from practice, their worldview is truly the source of Marxist-Leninist theory, and their practical experience is truly the driving force of the technological revolution and technological innovation.

These many concrete facts I saw in the study tour gave me the most profound lessons. When I recall my past sins of not humbly accepting the Party's leadership, I am sweating and ashamed. I truly realize that the correct prescription for my reform is: put politics in command, strengthen leadership, listen to the Party, follow the Party wholeheartedly, and always follow Chairman Mao.

**Continuing the struggle between the two roads and the two lines during the socialist construction period is absolutely wise**

Second, from the study tours, I have further realized that Chairman Mao's continuation of the struggle between the two roads and the two lines during the transitional period of socialist construction in China, based on the truth of Marx's theory of continuous revolution, is absolutely wise. By 1956, China's economic revolution had basically been victorious. The Party and Chairman Mao timely put forward two great calls for political revolution and ideological revolution. Chairman Mao combined "fighting against nature" with class struggle. This guaranteed the victory of China's construction cause. With the rectification and anti-rightist movement in 1957, there was the all-round Great Leap Forward in the construction cause in 1958; with the "oppose right deviation, encourage vigor" movement proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, there was the continued all-round Great Leap Forward in the country's construction cause in 1959. This is a concrete example. This time when I visited Hubei, I saw that in many construction projects, whenever the phenomenon of slow productivity due to the mischief of right-leaning backward thinking occurred, the productivity immediately increased by leaps and bounds after a class struggle, and the production volume also greatly increased. In the country's various construction projects, there are really countless such examples. For example, after the Wuhan Boiler Factory underwent the "anti-right deviation, encourage vigor" movement in 1959, if the July product was taken as the base number of one hundred; the August product increased to one hundred and twenty-four; September was four hundred and ninety-five; November was five hundred and ninety-five. The factory's November 1959 product was more than five times that of July of the same year. When I asked the factory leaders why the productivity had suddenly increased by leaps and bounds, their unanimous answer was: after ideological struggle, the ideological awareness of the working people has been improved. This kind of example fully illustrates that in the socialist construction cause, we must clear away the obstacles of residual bourgeois ideas, and we must conduct class struggle at any time to ensure the victory of all socialist construction causes in this transitional period.

In the spring of 1957, Chairman Mao said: "Propose the problem of correctly handling contradictions among the people, in order to unite the people of all ethnic groups in the country to carry out a new war - a war against nature." In the same speech, he also said: "The large-scale, rapid and violent mass class struggle of the revolutionary period has basically ended, but the class struggle has not ended." At that time, I, an ideologically backward person, understood this passage out of context, paying special attention to the sentence "the large-scale, rapid and violent mass class struggle has basically ended," and ignorantly believing that "fighting against nature" and "class struggle" were two unrelated things that could not be carried out at the same time. I absurdly believed that bourgeois ideas could be safely and comfortably survived. This relaxed my own learning and reform, and finally fell into serious sins. After several recent field visits, I realized that the existence of residual bourgeois ideas would inevitably hinder the smooth progress of the socialist construction cause, and must be completely eliminated in order to guarantee the victory of "fighting against nature." Chairman Mao's proposal of "the class struggle has not ended" in 1957, followed by the two calls for political revolution and ideological revolution, is proving the truth of the theory of continuous revolution with facts. Gaining this understanding from the study tour is of great help to my understanding of my past mistakes and strengthening my determination for self-reform. The socialist revolution led by the Party will never allow, nor can it tolerate, the residual bourgeois ideas to safely and comfortably survive. For a person like me who has committed serious crimes, the only way to survive is to accelerate my reform, catch up with the wheels of the times, and get on the train!

**The noble qualities and lofty style of the new people have educated me and strengthened my confidence in reform**

Third, through the visit, seeing the noble qualities and lofty style of the new people in the new society and their contribution to the happiness of the country and the people, I am motivated to further strengthen my determination and confidence in self-reform. Due to different class positions and worldviews, there are truly two distinctly different types of people in society. One is the type of person who is not afraid of difficulties and is courageous to overcome difficulties; the other is the type of person who is intimidated by difficulties and shrinks back when they see difficulties. The former are people who have reformed and liberated their minds, and are new people in the new society; the latter are people in society with residual bourgeois ideas. I saw many such contrasting facts during the visit, and what touched me most deeply was the ideological debate and struggle I heard about the initial start or non-start of the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Project.

The Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Project is one of the current large-scale projects. After its completion, it will forever eliminate the flood disasters of the Han River that occur once in a century. It will possibly play the role of diverting the Han River to relieve the Huai River and diverting the Han River to relieve the Yellow River, turning the water disasters of the Yellow River and the Han River for thousands of years into water conservancy. This is truly a difficult and fierce battle of "fighting against nature."

When such a magnificent and huge project as Danjiangkou was about to start construction in September 1958, what was the preparation for the project work? The conditions of tools and equipment and living equipment were very lacking, lacking working machinery, lacking transportation tools, no electricity, no fuel. Lacking workers' residential houses, workers' daily food, workers' medical treatment, etc. All of this had to be started at the same time as the collection. Whether the project should be started or not became an extremely sharp debate on that day. However, the new laboring masses in the new society under the leadership of the Party resolutely overcame this struggle and defeated the cowardly, shrinking, and intimidated minority of ideologically backward people. Those who opposed the start of construction believed that the preparation conditions were not sufficient, while the Party leaders believed that "the best preparation is ideological preparation, and the best condition is the condition of political awareness." This is a truly thought-provoking and majestic statement. The Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Project was started under the leadership of the Party, using the pragmatic method of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, mainly indigenous methods, first indigenous then foreign methods." The people's communes of Hubei and Henan provinces jointly dispatched 100,000 laboring peasants, initially relying mainly on a carrying pole and two baskets per person, and bravely started fighting against nature. Their battle song was: "Dig up the bottom of the Han River, destroy the Dragon King's Palace, the weather is cold and the ground is cold, but the heart is not cold, the hands are frozen and the feet are frozen, but the heart is not frozen." This is truly an earth-shattering and world-shaking song. This is the quality, style, and spirit of the new people in the new society! When I arrived at the Danjiangkou construction site for a visit, I was truly moved by the sight and felt a thousand emotions. I imagined myself in the position and thought, if I were one of the cadres working in Danjiangkou in September 1958, would I dare to agree to start the construction? I believe that with my backward thinking at that time, I would definitely be intimidated by difficulties and would definitely be a leader who opposed the start of construction. I also recalled the four majestic war songs mentioned earlier, and I couldn't help but secretly shed tears of shame. I stood alone in deep thought on the construction site in the cofferdam, silently, my eyes watching the labor force of thousands of people in teams and tens of thousands of people in groups, watching them carrying mud baskets on their shoulders, stepping on muddy paths, full of energy, full of smiles, and constantly fighting against water and mountains. I, a bourgeois intellectual who eats without farming, wears without weaving, and stands by idly, truly felt ashamed. At this moment, I truly realized the meaning of the two words "exploitation." I sincerely expressed my high admiration to those hardworking laborers who were not afraid of difficulties, intimidated by difficulties, and courageous to conquer difficulties. They are truly heroes who swallow mountains and rivers, call for high mountains to bow their heads, and call for rivers to give way. Their qualities, spirit, and style gave the bourgeois ideas in my mind a stinging satire and whip. These heroic laborers are exactly the masters I should reform and learn from, and they are the objects I should encourage myself to learn from. This is another point of understanding and awakening I gained from the visit.

In summary, through study tours, I have indeed gained a deeper understanding of "put politics in command, strengthen leadership," the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune proposed by the Party and Chairman Mao, and the superiority of socialism. Every time I visited, I felt more regret for my past sins, and I was infinitely moved and transformed by the new people and new things in today's new society.

When I visited the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Project, I also realized this point: today, the people's power of the new China under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao is truly invincible in the occasion of waging war against nature. The Yellow River, the Han River, and the Dan River, which have harmed the Chinese people for thousands of years, can be made obedient and submissive by the people, not allowed to flood and run wild, and can be used for irrigation, power generation, fish farming, and even water diversion from the south to the north, turning harm into benefit. Can the Party and Chairman Mao, leading more than 600 million Chinese people with such great and unparalleled power, not sweep away the remnants of the bourgeoisie and consolidate the socialist system? Today, the socialist revolutionary policy implemented by the Party and Chairman Mao is to turn harm into benefit in the war against nature. In the ideological revolution, it has repeatedly instructed to mobilize all positive factors, and for those who have committed sins, it is to turn the negative into the positive. This is exactly to enable all people at the end of their road to embark on the bright and happy road through reform. Realizing these, I have further strengthened my determination and confidence in reform.

Today, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, in the movement of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the people of the whole country are truly increasingly giving play to soaring enthusiasm and creative spirit, and increasingly promoting the noble style of communism. They are of one mind, encouraging vigor, waging war against nature, transforming the objective world, and transforming the subjective world at the same time. This kind of universally booming and emerging atmosphere throughout the country really makes me, a person who has committed serious mistakes in the past, consciously feel small and remorseful everywhere when visiting. When I was facing the millions of hardworking laborers on the Danjiangkou construction site, I remembered these words of Chairman Mao in the first issue of "Red Flag" three years ago: "Never have I seen the masses of the people so spirited, so high-spirited, and so high-spirited as they are now. The former exploiting classes are completely trapped in the vast ocean of the laboring masses, and they have to change even if they don't want to." I realized that Chairman Mao's words have infinite power and are absolute truth. At Danjiangkou, I truly felt that I was one of the people trapped in the vast ocean of the laboring masses, and I was once again spurred by "have to change even if you don't want to"!

Existence determines consciousness. External causes promote internal causes. Today's national scene is so glorious and brilliant. Today's future of the people of the whole country is so bright and happy. I am not made of wood or stone, can I not be deeply moved and transformed? The Party and the government have given me, a person who has committed sins, such lenient punishment in the past, and in the past few years have given me various good opportunities for reform and learning. I sincerely thank the Party. I want to listen to the Party wholeheartedly and always follow the Party and Chairman Mao!

As the ancient saying goes, "Poverty leads to change, change leads to access." Everything in the universe is moving and changing. Everything is moving and changing, which is the objective law. What's more, today's national objective environment makes it necessary for anyone who has made mistakes to change, and there is even more possibility of change. People can be reformed. I want to reform. I will reform. I have the determination and confidence to reform. I vow to listen to the Party, always follow the Party, and follow Chairman Mao. I will definitely work hard to accelerate my self-reform, turn the negative into the positive, turn the harmful into the beneficial, and turn the useless into the useful, in order to repay the Party, the country, and the people in the slightest!

This time, as a member of the CPPCC, I attended the National People's Congress as a nonvoting delegate and listened to the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. I am determined to study these valuable documents carefully to improve my political awareness and help my own reform!

### 参观学习对加速自我改造有很大帮助  罗隆基委员的发言

    参观学习对加速自我改造有很大帮助
    罗隆基委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    首先，我向党表示衷诚的感激。我感激党对我这样一个犯过严重罪过的人，几年来继续不断地给予我在自我改造上各种学习的机会，特别在最近一年来，给予我到北京以外许多地方去进行实际参观学习，例如1959年7月到东北三省各城市参观重工业建设事业，1959年12月到河南的安阳参观“由土到洋，土洋并举”的大炼钢铁事业，今年3月到湖北省武汉市参观新兴的轻重工业和到丹江口参观大型的水利工程事业。这一系列的实地参观学习，对我的改造有了很大的和很好的帮助。
    通过参观，我亲眼看到国家社会主义建设事业的这许许多多惊人的奇迹，它们就无可争辩地证实了总路线是绝对英明正确的；大跃进是国家各项建设事业的高速度按比例发展的成果，并且今后必定持续地跃进；人民公社愈益显示了伟大的生命力，它的发展已经从乡村迅速地扩展到了许多重要的城市，它必定有光辉灿烂的前途。这一切辉煌巨大的成绩，就充分地证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。国家的社会主义建设事业，特别在最近两三年来，所以能够取得这般飞跃的进展，原因就是真正地实现了政治挂帅，在党的坚强领导下，贯彻了群众路线和“两条腿走路”的方针。这是毛泽东思想，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理结合中国社会主义革命和建设实践的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    上面所举各端，今天已经是全中国人民异口同声歌颂的事实，用不着我再来重复地加以说明和赞扬。今天在这里我只愿结合我的思想情况，特别结合我对自我改造的殷切愿望，来谈谈我在最近几次参观学习中所得到的启发和教育。
    政治挂帅，加强领导，听党的话，一心一意跟着党走，永远跟着毛主席走
    第一，从参观学习中，我进一步地了解了“政治挂帅，加强领导”这两句话的真实意义，并且更清楚地认识了自己以往的严重罪过。过去我错误地以为党的领导只是政治思想的领导，在贯彻社会主义和共产主义的实现方面，又只是国家政策和方针的领导，只是总计划和总方案的领导，因此，我就认为这些只是党的高级领袖们的领导。过去我自以为我是肯听党的高级领袖们的话的，并且自以为我已经接受了党的领导，因而狂妄无知地轻视党的中下层的领导。反省以后，我才知道像我这个资产阶级思想根深蒂固的人，改造以前，是不可能一心一意地接受党的领导的。从这次参观学习中，我又认识到党的思想，政策和方针等等必须通过党的基层的领导，见诸实施。基层的干部就是真实地理解了并且掌握了党的思想、政策和方针的领导人。因此，不接受党的中下级组织的领导，实际就是不接受党的领导，就是拒绝政治挂帅。我亲眼看到党的基层领导人真是躬行实践的负责人。他们领导的方法不是指手划足，而是胼手胝足。他们真保持了革命战争时期红军传统的高贵品质和高尚风格。他们在工作中总是冲锋陷阵的先锋，把方便留给别人，把困难抢归自己。例如在湖北省丹江口水利工程围堰和合龙的时候，工程的总指挥，他已是省委书记和省长的身份，却亲身上阵，赤足下水，挥汗指挥。这不是亲自带头的领导吗？这不值得我的敬佩吗？他在对我们参观团讲话的时候就说：“我们做共产党干部的人，不会忘本”，而他所指的“本”是游击战争中饿肚皮，住茅棚，打赤足的“本”，是两万里长征中过雪山，走草原的“本”。因此，他又说“生活要向后看，生产要向前看”。这对我真是意味深长，发人深省的教训。我所举的不是个别的例子。通过参观，我发现工厂和公社中党的领导干部，差不多都具有这样的品质和风格。他们都有真诚纯朴的态度，大公无私的精神。他们对事业是认真负责的人，真是“先厂社之忧而忧，后厂社之乐而乐”。对这样的领导不应该尊重吗？中国谚语有“吃尽苦中苦，方做人上人”。我在参观学习中又体会到，党的基层领导干部是“吃尽苦中苦，不做人上人”。由于他们“不做人上人”，他们才真正贯彻了毛主席指示的走群众路线的方针。毛主席在实践中曾经指示过，“从群众中来，到群众中去”，这主要是指工作上的决策定计说的。我对党的基层领导干部又有了这样的认识：他们是“出身实从群众中来，干活总到群众中去”。我在参观中所接触到的厂社中的领导干部，差不多都是从工农群众中凭自己的工作成绩选拔出来的，而工作却仍然是工农群众中的一员。那末，这样的领导干部，在理论知识和工艺技术上是“外行领导内行”吗？事实又彻底地驳斥了我这个思想落后人以往荒谬的阶级成见。他们是从实践中来的人，他们的宇宙观才真是马列主义理论的根源，而他们的实践经验，才真是技术革命和技术革新的动力。
    我在参观学习中看到的这许多具体的事实，真给了我最深刻的教训。当我回忆到当年我不虚心接受党的领导的罪过，我就汗流浃背，愧惭无地。我的确认识到，我改造的对症药方是：政治挂帅，加强领导，听党的话，一心一意跟着党走，永远跟着毛主席走。
    在社会主义建设时期，继续进行两条道路和两条路线的斗争是绝对英明的
    第二，从参观学习中，我进一步地认识到，毛主席根据马克思不断革命论的真理，在中国社会主义建设的过渡时期中，继续进行两条道路和两条路线的斗争是绝对英明的。中国到了1956年，经济革命已经基本上胜利了。党和毛主席又及时地提出了政治革命和思想革命两个伟大的号召。毛主席把“向自然界开战”同阶级斗争结合起来了。这就保证了中国建设事业的胜利。有了1957年的整风反右运动，就有了1958年建设事业的全面大跃进；有了党的八届八中全会提出的“右反倾，鼓干劲”的运动，就又有了1959年国家建设事业的继续全面大跃进。这是具体的例子。这次我在湖北参观的时候，看到在许多建设事业中，每因右倾落后思想作祟而使生产率稍有迟缓的现象，经过一次阶级斗争，生产率就马上有了飞跃的上升，而生产量也就马上大大的提高了。在国家各项建设事业中，这样的事例真是举不胜举。例如武汉锅炉厂，在1959年经过“反右倾，鼓干劲”的运动后，若以7月的产品做基数为一百；8月产品就提高到一百二十四；9月为四百九十五；11月为五百九十五。工厂1959年11月的产品为同年7月的五倍以上。当我问到工厂领导人，为什么生产率会这样突然地飞跃提高的时候，他们前后一致的答复是：经过思想斗争，劳动人民的思想觉悟提高了。这种事例，就充分地说明了，在社会主义建设事业中，必须扫清残余资产阶级思想这种障碍，必须随时进行阶级斗争，以保证在这个过渡时期中，一切社会主义建设事业的胜利。
    在1957年春季的时候，毛主席说：“提出正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，以便团结全国各族人民进行一场新的战争——向自然界开战”。在同一篇讲话中又说：“革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争已经基本结束，但是阶级斗争并没有结束。”当时我这个思想落后的人，就断章取义地来了解这段话，就特别注意了“大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争已经基本结束”这一句话，并且无知地认为“向自然界开战”同“阶级斗争”是不相关联的两回事，是不可能同时进行的。我就荒谬地认为资产阶级思想或可偷安苟活，苟延残喘。这就放松了我自己的学习和改造，终于自陷于严重的罪过。经过最近几次的实地参观，才认识到残余的资产阶级思想存在，必定会妨碍社会主义建设事业的顺利进行，必须加以彻底的消灭，才能保证“向自然界开战”的胜利。毛主席在1957年提出“阶级斗争并没有结束”，后来接着又提出政治革命和思想革命两个号召，正用事实证明了不断革命论这条真理。从参观学习中得到这一点体会，这对我认识自己过去的错误和加强自我改造的决心，是有很大的帮助的。党领导的社会主义革命是绝不会容许，也不可能容忍残余的资产阶级思想偷安苟活的。像我这样犯过严重罪过的人，唯一适存之道，只有加速改造自己，追到时代前进的车轮，赶上车去！
    新人物的高贵品质和高尚风格，使我受到了教育，加强了改造信心
    第三，通过参观，看到新社会中新人的高贵品质和高尚风格以及他们对国家和人民的幸福的贡献，推动我更加强了自我改造的决心和信心。由于阶级立场和世界观不同，社会中就真有了两种截然不同类型的人。一种是不怕困难，勇于克服困难的人；另一种是为困难所吓倒，见困难就缩头的人。前者是思想改造了和解放了的人，是新社会中的新人；后者是社会中具有残余的资产阶级思想的人。这种对照的事实，我在参观中看到了许多，而最使我受到深刻感动的是我听到的丹江口水利工程最初上马与不上马的一场思想争论和斗争。
    丹江口的水利工程是目前规模巨大的工程之一，建成以后，它将永远消灭汉水百年一遇的洪水灾害。它将可能起引汉济淮和引汉济黄的南水北调作用，使几千年来黄河和汉水的水患变为水利。这真是“向自然界开战”的一场艰巨激烈的大战。
    丹江口这样一项宏伟巨大的工程，在1958年9月将要开工的时候，工程工作上的筹备是怎样呢？工具设备和生活设备的条件是很缺乏的，缺少工作机械，缺少运输工具，没有电力，没有燃料。缺少工人的居住房屋，工人的日用粮食，工人疾病的医药等等。这一切都要一边上马，同时一边来筹集。工程的上马或不上马成了当日极为尖锐的争论。然而在党领导下的新社会中新的劳动群众却坚决地战胜了这场斗争，把怯懦的，畏缩的，为困难所吓倒的少数思想落后的人战败了。反对上马的人，认为准备的条件不够，而党的领导人则认为“最好的准备是思想准备，最好的条件是政治觉悟的条件”。这真是发人深省的壮语。丹江口水利工程就在党的领导下，用“土洋并举，以土为主，先土后洋”的实事求是的办法上马了。鄂豫两省的人民公社，就共同抽调了十万劳动农民，最初每人主要只凭着一根扁担，两只箩筐，勇敢地向自然界开战了。他们的战歌是：“掘开汉江底，捣毁龙王宫，天寒地寒心不寒，冻手冻脚不冻心。”这真是惊天动地，震撼人世的歌声。这就是新社会中新人的品质，风格和气概！当我到了丹江口工地参观的时候，真是睹物生情，万感交集。我就设身处地的追想，倘使1958年9月我是一个在丹江口工作的干部之一，我敢赞成上马吗？我相信以我当日的落后思想，一定为困难所吓倒，一定是一个反对上马的头目。我又回想起前面提到的四句雄壮的战歌，我不禁惭愧得偷偷地落下泪来。我独自沉凝深思地站在围堰里的工地上，静默默地，两眼望着那千人成队，万人成群的劳动队伍，看他们肩担泥筐，脚踏泥途，满身精力，满面笑容，正在往来不停，循环不息地同水和山作战斗。我这个不耕而食，不织而衣，袖手旁观的资产阶级知识分子，真有自惭形秽之感。此际，才真令人体会到“剥削”两字的意义。我对那些不怕困难，吓倒困难，并且勇于征服困难的辛勤工作的劳动者，衷心致以崇高的敬佩。他们真是气吞山河，叫高山低头，叫河水让路的英雄。他们的品质，精神和风格给予我头脑中的资产阶级思想以痛入骨髓的讽刺和鞭鞑。这些英雄的劳动者正是我改造和学习的师傅，他们是我应该勉励学习的对象。这是我在参观中得到的又一点体会和觉悟。
    总结起来说，通过参观学习，我对“政治挂帅，加强领导”，对党和毛主席提出来的总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三个法宝，对社会主义的优越性，的确有了进一步的认识，每多参观一次，就使我对自己以往的罪过多增加了愧悔，对今天新社会的新人新事，就受到了无限的感动和感化。
    在参观丹江口水利工程的时候，我还觉悟到这样一点：今天党和毛主席领导的新中国的人民力量，在向自然界作战争的场合中，真是无攻不克，无战不胜。几千年为害中国人民的黄河，汉水，和丹江，人民可以使它们听命驯服，不许泛滥乱流，可以使它们灌田，发电，养鱼，甚至南水北调，化为害为有利，难道党和毛主席领导中国六亿以上的人民，以这样伟大无比的力量，还不能扫荡资产阶级的残余，巩固社会主义制度吗？今天党和毛主席执行的社会主义革命政策，对自然界的战争，是要变有害为有利，在思想革命中，又一再指示过，是要调动一切积极因素，而对犯过罪过的人，是要化消极为积极。这正是使一切穷途末路的人，通过改造，走上光明幸福的大道。体会到这些，就更加强了我改造的决心和信心。
  今天全国人民在党和毛主席的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的运动中，真是越来越发挥冲天干劲和创造精神，越来越发扬共产主义的高尚风格。他们万众一心，鼓足干劲，正在向自然界战争，改造客观世界，同时改造主观世界。这种全国普遍的蓬蓬勃勃的新兴气象，实令我这个过去犯过严重错误的人，在参观的时候，到处自觉渺小和愧悔。当我在丹江口工地上面对着千千万万辛勤工作的劳动者的时候，我就记起了毛主席三年前在“红旗”第一号的文章里的这几句话：“从来也没有看见人民群众像现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。过去的剥削阶级完全陷落在劳动群众的汪洋大海中，他们不想变也得变。”我就觉悟到毛主席这几句话有无限的威力，是绝对的真理。在丹江口的时候，我真感到自己是陷在劳动群众汪洋大海中的一个人，我再一次地受到“不想变也得变”的鞭策了！
    存在决定意识。外因推动内因。今天国家的景象是这样的光辉灿烂。今天全国人民的前途是这样的光明幸福。人非木石，我能不深受感动，心为感化吗？党和政府对我这个犯过罪过的人，过去予以这样宽大的惩处，而几年来又复给予我改造和学习的种种良好的机会。我真诚地感激党。我要一心一意地听党的话，永远跟着党和毛主席走！
    古语说得好，“穷则变，变则通”。宇宙间一切事物都是动的变的。都在动在变，这是客观的规律。何况今天国家客观的环境，使任何犯过错误的人，有改变的必要，更有改变的可能。人是可以改造的。我要改造。我会改造。我有改造的决心和信心。我立愿听党的话，永远跟着党走，跟着毛主席走。我必定努力加速自我改造，变消极为积极，变有害为有利，变无用为有用，以求报答党、国家和人民于万一！
    这次，我以政协委员的身份，列席全国人民代表大会，听到了李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告，我决心好好地学习这些宝贵的文件，以提高自己的政治觉悟，帮助自己的改造！
