Xinhua News Agency, April 1st -- The Hungarian Liberation 15th Anniversary Political Document Photo Exhibition opened today at the Water Pavilion of Zhongshan Park in the capital. The exhibition is sponsored by the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Association.

　　The more than two hundred carefully selected pictures displayed here vividly show the achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in Hungary over the past fifteen years since liberation. Many photos vividly reflect the happy life of the Hungarian people today. Photos recording Sino-Hungarian friendship are particularly eye-catching.

　　The exhibition will be on display from April 1st to 21st. It will then be exhibited on tour in other places.
