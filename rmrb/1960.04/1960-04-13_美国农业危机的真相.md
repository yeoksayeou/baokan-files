The truth about the American agricultural crisis Lin Longtie
    Recently, the statements of responsible officials of the US government and the reports of the US press have reflected the continued deterioration of the long-standing US agricultural "overproduction" crisis. In his State of the Union address at the beginning of this year, Eisenhower asked Congress to amend agricultural laws to solve the problem of "surplus" agricultural products piled up like mountains. In his agricultural address in February, he again worriedly pointed out that the huge "surplus" agricultural products in the United States and the declining trend of farmers' income have become "one of the most troubling domestic problems" at present. He asked Congress to drastically reduce cultivated land, cut agricultural product price subsidies, and increase exports to alleviate the serious agricultural crisis. It can be seen that the chronic disease of the American agricultural crisis has reached the serious point of "desperate measures."
    Production "surplus," farmers suffer
    The current agricultural situation in the United States is specifically manifested as: the area of cultivated land is shrinking, unsalable agricultural products are piling up more and more, agricultural product prices are falling, farmers' income and living standards are declining sharply, middle and small farmers are accelerating impoverishment and large-scale bankruptcy, while land and agricultural production are increasingly concentrated in the hands of large farm owners, and farmers' dissatisfaction with the US government's agricultural policies is growing.
    The US "Time" magazine published on February 22 pointed out that the total value of agricultural products piled up in the United States due to inability to sell was 3 billion US dollars in 1953, and has jumped to more than 9 billion US dollars by 1959. The wheat "surplus" problem is the most serious, with a total value of 3.5 billion US dollars. According to the "New York Times," the US government's stock of wheat in 1959 reached 1.4 billion bushels (each bushel is about 36 liters), an increase of 8% over 1958, and the "surplus" corn was 2.1 billion bushels, an increase of more than 30% over 1958. In addition, the "surplus" cotton reached 9.2 million bales (each bale is 500 pounds), an increase of 3% over 1958. Eisenhower admitted that in order to store and manage these "surplus" agricultural products, the US government must spend 1.5 million US dollars per day.
    Due to the large number of unsalable agricultural products, urban commercial monopolies took the opportunity to lower the purchase price of agricultural products. According to US newspapers, the current price of agricultural products has fallen to the lowest level in nineteen years. On the other hand, the prices of fertilizers, agricultural tools, and other industrial products purchased by farmers continue to rise. According to official statistics, the price of industrial products in 1959 increased by 28% compared with the average from 1947 to 1949, which resulted in a continuous increase in agricultural production costs, which increased by 3.5% in 1959 alone compared with 1958. Coupled with interest and taxes, etc., farmers' income has been declining year by year. Figures recently released by the US Department of Agriculture show that farmers' net income in 1959 was only 11 billion US dollars, 13.1 billion US dollars in 1958, and 17.1 billion US dollars in 1947. According to statistics from the US Congressional Joint Economic Committee, the net income of each farm household in 1959 has decreased from 3,000 US dollars in 1952 to 2,200 US dollars. Moreover, the above figures also include the income of large farm owners and agricultural monopoly capitalists, and it does not show the true situation of middle and small farmers trending towards bankruptcy and poverty. If the impact of the devaluation of the US dollar (currently one US dollar is only equivalent to 48 cents in 1939, while it was 52 cents in 1952) and rising prices are taken into account, the actual income of farmers is even more pitiful.
    US farmers have seen their income sharply reduced due to increased production costs, and their income is not enough to cover their expenses. Most people are forced to look for sideline income. Even so, debts still grow year by year. Due to the inability to repay short-term debts, many people often change to long-term debts secured by land mortgages. In 1956, US farmers mortgaged 349 million acres of land, accounting for 30.1% of the total cultivated land area. The "New York Times" pointed out that the number of farm foreclosures due to unpaid debts by US farmers last year exceeded the average for the past ten years. Last year, the total amount of farmers' real estate debts (including mortgage debts) increased by 6% to 11.3 billion US dollars, which is equal to 11.5% of the total value of US farmers' property; if various debts are included, it has exceeded 20 billion US dollars. Recently, US newspapers have increasingly talked about the tragic situation of US farmers. Not long ago, the United Press International reported that a farmer in South Dakota, Kopfmann, committed suicide after killing his wife and two children because he could not pay off the debt for buying agricultural tools, which reflects the current desperate situation of US farmers.
    The law of capitalist economy is that the big fish eats the small fish, and this situation is no exception in agriculture. The squeezing out and annexation of US large agricultural monopoly capital has accelerated the bankruptcy of middle and small farmers and promoted a sharp decline in the rural population. According to official US materials, the agricultural population accounted for 18.9% of the total US population in 1947, a total of 27.12 million people; by 1958, it had decreased to 20.82 million people, accounting for only 12% of the total population. In just eleven years, 6.3 million people have been forced to leave the countryside. The "Wall Street Journal" pointed out in November last year that since 1950, the number of medium and small farms has decreased by one million, and in the past twenty years, more than two million medium and small farms have been eliminated or annexed by large farms. A large number of farmers deprived of land either joined the ranks of agricultural workers or flowed into cities to look for work, expanding the army of the unemployed. At the same time, agricultural production and land are increasingly concentrated in highly mechanized and wage-labor large farms controlled by agricultural monopoly capital. According to official census figures in 1954, large farms of more than 1,000 acres (each acre is equal to 6.07 mu) accounted for only 2.7% of the total number of farms in the country, but accounted for 45.9% of the country's cultivated land area; while small farmers of less than 10 acres, accounting for 10.1% of the total number of farms in the country, accounted for only 0.2% of the country's cultivated land area. In recent years, this phenomenon of land concentration has become more prominent.
    Another characteristic of the agricultural situation in the United States is the reduction in the area of cultivated land. From 1930 to 1958, the harvested area of 59 crops in the United States decreased from 359.89 million acres to 321.1 million acres. This shows that the decaying capitalist system increasingly hinders the development of agricultural productivity.
    Reasons for agricultural product "surplus"
    In his agricultural address this year, Eisenhower attributed the current agricultural crisis in the United States to "overproduction," attempting to cover up the essence of the crisis. But in fact, according to figures released by the US Department of Agriculture, livestock product output in 1958 was 124% of the average from 1947 to 1949, while agricultural product output in 1959 only reached 118% of the average from 1947 to 1949, which was still achieved by expanding the planting area of corn to increase total output. Therefore, the output of agricultural and livestock products in the United States has only increased by an average of slightly more than 1% per year in the past ten years, while the US population has increased by about three million per year after the war. If calculated on a per capita basis, the growth rate is even lower.
    In fact, the reason why US agricultural products are "surplus" is mainly due to the acute contradictions between capitalist production and consumption. Because large monopoly enterprises control the procurement, processing, and sales departments of agricultural products, in order to pursue profits, they are constantly lowering the purchase price of agricultural products while constantly raising the retail price of food processed from grain and agricultural products. For example, taking 1947 to 1949 as 100, in 1958, the price of food in US cities rose by 20.3%, of which food processed from grain rose by 33.1%; meat rose by 15%; dairy products rose by 13.5%; and fruits and vegetables rose by 27%. At the same time, due to the US government's stepped-up efforts to expand armaments and prepare for war, causing inflation, taxes are becoming increasingly heavy, and people's incomes are constantly decreasing, making the vast majority of people increasingly impoverished. George Meany, chairman of the AFL-CIO Executive Committee, also said recently when testifying before the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee that at least 20 million workers in the United States are currently "in a worse situation than poverty... often going hungry." The impoverishment of the broad masses of working people has continuously weakened purchasing power and affected their full consumption of food. According to official figures, the average per capita consumption of flour in the United States has decreased from 214 pounds in 1910 to 118 pounds in 1958. Democratic Senator Kennedy, who is running for US president, recently admitted that 17 million Americans "go to bed hungry every night."
    Despite the fact that millions of Americans are starving right now, the US ruling clique would rather let large quantities of grain rot in warehouses. This is the truth about the so-called agricultural product "surplus" in the United States. Senator Bridges said: "I believe that if every citizen in the United States were to eat to the extent they should, our surplus agricultural products would certainly be eaten up."
      A policy that abandons the fundamental for the superficial
      "US News & World Report" once pointed out that the US agricultural "overproduction" crisis began in the 1920s. In order to alleviate this crisis, the US government has spent nearly forty years, spending hundreds of billions of US dollars, and experimented with nearly ten plans. But no matter which plan, it mainly guarantees the profits of monopoly capitalists engaged in the production and sales of agricultural products at the expense of the interests of working people and farmers. Therefore, it not only cannot solve the chronic disease of the agricultural crisis, but also deepens the "surplus" crisis day by day.
    During Eisenhower's administration, three main measures were taken to solve the "surplus" crisis. The first is to implement price support measures for six agricultural products, including wheat, corn, cotton, rice, tobacco, and peanuts, in order to maintain and guarantee a certain market price in order to ensure the profits of large farm owners and prevent price collapses. This measure is actually the state using taxes extracted from millions of laborers to subsidize large agricultural owners for the difference between the price at which they sell their products and the guaranteed price, and the government purchases or accepts mortgages on surplus agricultural products. In 1958, 40% of US farmers' net income of 13.1 billion US dollars came from government subsidies. The vast majority of this money goes into the pockets of large farm owners. For example, in the fiscal year 1956 to 1957, price subsidies obtained by farms with an annual output value of more than 5,000 US dollars accounted for 79% of the total planned appropriation, while small farms with an annual output value of less than 2,500 US dollars, accounting for 56% of the total number of farms in the country, only received 9%. Moreover, because the US government artificially isolates agricultural products from the market, reducing the supply of agricultural products to the market in order to maintain the expensive retail prices of agricultural products, this guarantees the profits of monopoly capitalists engaged in the production and sales of agricultural products. The result of this measure has caused a contraction of the domestic market and an increasing accumulation of agricultural products.
    Secondly, the Eisenhower government implemented a policy of restricting the planting area of major crops. The US government, through the so-called "land bank," gives farmers a certain amount of money to restrict them from producing crops that are currently classified as "surplus." This has resulted in 28 million acres of cultivated land being taken out of production in 1959.
    The above two measures are beneficial to large farm owners who engage in large-scale production and supply the market with large quantities of agricultural products. Large farm owners often stop cultivating the most barren land and concentrate machinery and fertilizers on the already reduced but more fertile fields for intensive cultivation, offsetting the reduction in output caused by the reduction in planting area by increasing the yield per unit area, and obtaining large amounts of money from government price subsidies. Therefore, the agricultural crisis does not cause them to suffer losses. However, middle and small farmers, whose burden of taxes, rent, and debt is constantly increasing, are unable to make investments. Therefore, they cannot make up for the losses caused by the reduction in planting area by increasing the yield per unit area. Therefore, it is increasingly difficult to resist the competition from large farms with lower production costs. At the same time, because middle and small farmers cannot produce their own grain, they are also harmed by the government's policy of maintaining expensive retail prices, just like urban residents. Eisenhower admitted in his 1954 State of the Union address: "The main beneficiaries of our price support policies are two million larger, highly mechanized farms. The production level of the remaining 3.5 million farms is so low that farm owners rarely benefit from maintaining high prices." This agricultural policy of the US government is less about alleviating the agricultural production crisis and more about accelerating the bankruptcy of middle and small farmers.
    In addition to taking measures to restrict agricultural production, the US government also takes measures to strengthen state-subsidized exports and dump agricultural products abroad at reduced prices (often a quarter lower than the cost) in order to reduce the accumulated "surplus" agricultural products. The increase in US agricultural product exports after the war was mainly achieved through increased supply under various "US aid" programs. The US government "generously" subsidizes the export of 35 agricultural products with taxes taken from taxpayers' pockets. From the effective date of Article 480 of 1954 (the main law authorizing the provision of surplus materials to foreign countries) to June 1958, the US government allocated 4.8 billion US dollars to subsidize agricultural product exports. Due to the widespread use of dumping methods, a report submitted by Eisenhower to Congress in February this year stated that in the past three years, the average export of US agricultural products reached 4.15 billion US dollars. In 1958, agricultural product exports accounted for 21% of total US exports.
    Because the US government does not solve the fundamental problem by raising people's purchasing power and consumption levels, the US "surplus" agricultural products have continued to increase despite the various measures taken by the US government. The crisis cannot be resolved.
    Although Eisenhower admitted that the agricultural crisis was serious, he still could not come up with any effective new solutions. In his agricultural address, he suggested that the area of land taken out of production be increased to 60 million acres this year to reduce crop output; at the same time, price subsidies for agricultural products should be reduced and agricultural expenditures should be reduced to alleviate the current increasingly serious financial crisis. "US News & World Report" pointed out that the US government is actively promoting a so-called "food for peace" plan, preparing to export a large number of agricultural products to "friendly" countries through price reductions, donations, and payment in local currency. To this end, the US government has recently sent agricultural experts to some countries in Western Europe, West Asia, and Latin America to study the issue of dumping agricultural products. These facts show that the US government is attempting to further shift the increasingly developing agricultural "overproduction" crisis onto the people of other countries.
    US newspapers are not optimistic about the agricultural outlook. Some newspapers pointed out that if the area taken out of production is greatly increased, the "land bank" expenditure will rise from the current 350 million US dollars to 1 billion US dollars. And reducing price subsidies for agricultural products will inevitably bankrupt more middle and small farmers. Due to the shrinking capitalist world market, many agricultural product exporting countries have also stepped up competition. The export value of US agricultural products in 1958 and 1959 both decreased compared with 1957, and 1959 decreased by 6% compared with 1958. At the same time, the US policy of dumping agricultural products to harm others and benefit itself is increasingly causing dissatisfaction among many agricultural product exporting countries.
    Because the United States will hold presidential and congressional elections in November this year, US newspapers pointed out that the agricultural issue has become a sharp political issue between the Republican and Democratic parties in the election campaign. The US "Newsweek" in January this year had already made a prediction: the two parties will only have a "big quarrel" over the agricultural issue, and there will be no new solutions. This means that the US agricultural crisis is bound to continue to deepen. (Attached picture)

    美国农业危机的真相	林龙铁
    最近在美国政府负责官员的言谈和美国报刊的报道中，反映出旷日持久的美国农业“生产过剩”危机正继续恶化。艾森豪威尔在今年年初发表的国情咨文里，要求国会修改农业法律解决堆积成灾的“剩余”农产品问题。2月间他在农业咨文里又再忧心忡忡地指出，美国巨额的“剩余”农产品和农民收入日益下降的趋势，已成为当前“一个最使人烦恼的国内问题”。他要求国会大量缩小耕地面积、削减农产品价格补贴和增加出口来缓和严重的农业危机。可见美国农业危机的痼疾已到了“病笃乱投医”的严重地步了。	  生产“过剩”农民苦
    目前美国农业状况具体表现为：播种面积日益缩小，滞销农产品越积越多，农产品价格不断下跌，农民收入和生活水平急剧下降，中、小农户加速贫困化和大规模破产，而土地和农业生产越来越集中到大农场主手中，农民对美国政府农业政策不满情绪日益增长。
    2月22日出版的美国“时代”周刊指出，美国目前由于无法销售而堆积起来的农产品总值，1953年为三十亿美元，到1959年已跃增到九十余亿美元。小麦“剩余”问题最为严重，总值达三十五亿美元。据“纽约时报”报道，1959年美国政府手里积存的小麦，达十四亿蒲式耳（每蒲式耳约合三十六公升），比1958年增加8％，“剩余”玉蜀黍为二十一亿蒲式耳，比1958年增加30％以上，此外，“剩余”棉花达九百二十万包（每包五百磅），比1958年增加3％。艾森豪威尔承认，为了储存和保管这些“剩余”农产品，美国政府每天必须支出一百五十万美元的费用。
    由于大量农产品滞销，城市商业垄断企业乘机压低农产品收购价格。据美国报纸报道，目前农产品价格已跌到十九年来最低水平。另一方面，农民购买的肥料、农具和其他工业品价格却不断上涨。根据官方统计数字，1959年工业品价格比1947至1949年平均数上涨了28％，这就造成农业生产费用不断增加，仅1959年就比1958年上升3.5％，再加上利息和租税等等，就使农民收入逐年下降。美国农业部最近发表的数字表明，1959年农民纯收入只有一百一十亿美元，1958年是一百三十一亿美元，而在1947年则为一百七十一亿美元。据美国国会联合经济委员会统计，1959年每个农户的纯收入，已由1952年的三千美元下降至二千二百美元。而且上述数字还包括了大农场主以及农业垄断资本家的收入，它并不能表明中、小农户趋向破产与贫困的真实情况，如果将美元贬值（目前一美元只相当于1939年的四角八分，而在1952年为五角二分）和物价上涨影响计算在内，农民实际收入数目就更可怜了。
    美国农民由于生产成本增加而收入锐减，入不敷出，大部分人被迫寻找副业收入，即使如此，债务仍然年年增长。由于无力偿还短期债务，许多人往往改变成为用土地抵押的长期债务。在1956年美国农民抵押的土地就已达三亿四千九百万英亩，占全部耕地面积30.1％。“纽约时报”指出，美国农民由于没有偿清债务而被迫拍卖农场事件，去年超出了十年来的平均数字。去年农民不动产债务（包括抵押债务）总额增加6％，达一百一十三亿美元，等于美国农民财产总值11.5％；如果把各种债务计算在内，已超过了二百亿美元。最近美国报纸越来越多地谈及美国农民悲惨处境。不久前合众国际社报道南达科他州农民科普夫曼由于无力还清购买农具的债务，杀死妻子和两个孩子之后自杀的消息，就反映了当前美国农民走投无路的境况。
    大鱼吃小鱼是资本主义经济的规律，这种情况在农业方面也不例外。美国大农业垄断资本的排挤和吞并，加速了中、小农户的破产，并促使农村人口急剧减少。根据美国官方材料，1947年农业人口占美国总人口18.9％，共二千七百一十二万人；到了1958年减少到二千零八十二万人，只占总人口的12％。在短短十一年中，就有六百三十万人被迫离开农村。“华尔街日报”在去年11月间指出，从1950年以来，中、小农场减少一百万个，而在近二十年内，中、小农场被消灭或被大农场吞并的达二百万个以上。大量被剥夺了土地的农民或者参加了农业工人的队伍，或者流入城市寻找工作，扩大了失业大军。与此同时，农业生产和土地日益集中到农业垄断资本控制的高度机械化和雇佣劳动的大农场中。根据1954年官方普查数字，一千英亩（每英亩合六点零七市亩）以上的大农场只占全国农场总数2.7％，但却占有全国耕地面积45.9％；而占全国农场总数10.1％的十英亩以下小农户，只占有全国耕地面积的0.2％。近年来，这种土地集中的现象是更为突出了。
    美国农业状况的另一个特点，就是耕地面积的缩小。从1930年到1958年，美国五十九种作物的收获面积，从三亿五千九百八十九万英亩下降到三亿二千一百零十万英亩。这表明了腐朽的资本主义制度日益妨碍了农业生产力的发展。	  农产品“过剩”的原因
    艾森豪威尔在今年发表的农业咨文中，把美国当前的农业危机归咎于生产“过多”，企图掩盖危机的实质。但是事实上，根据美国农业部公布数字，1958年畜产品产量，为1947至1949年平均数的124％，而农产品在1959年才达到1947至1949年平均数的118％，这还是通过扩大玉蜀黍播种面积来提高总产量的。因此，美国农畜产品产量，在最近十多年中，每年平均只增加1％多，而战后美国每年人口约增加三百万，如按人口平均计算，增长率更低。
    实际上，美国农产品所以“过剩”，主要是由于资本主义生产和消费矛盾尖锐化而形成的。由于大垄断企业控制了农产品收购、加工和销售部门，它们为了追求利润，在不断压低农产品收购价格的同时，又不断抬高以粮食和农产品加工的食品的零售价格。如以1947至1949年为一百，在1958年，美国城市食品价格上涨20.3％，其中粮食加工的食品上涨33.1％；肉类上涨15％；乳制品13.5％；水果蔬菜上涨27％。同时，由于美国政府加紧扩军备战，造成通货膨胀，捐税日益加重，人民收入不断减少，广大人民越来越贫困。美国劳联—产联执行委员会主席米尼最近在参议院劳工与公共福利委员会作证时也说，美国目前至少有二千万工人“处在比贫困更为恶劣的状况之中……经常吃不饱”。广大劳动人民的贫困化不断削弱了购买力，影响了他们对粮食的充分消费。根据官方数字，美国每人面粉平均消费量，已从1910年的二百一十四磅，下降到1958年的一百一十八磅。正在竞选美国总统的民主党参议员肯尼迪最近承认，有一千七百万美国人“每天晚上饿着肚子上床。”
    尽管眼前千千万万美国人民饥肠辘辘，但是美国统治集团却宁愿让大批粮食在仓库里霉烂。美国的所谓农产品“过剩”的真相就是如此。参议员布里奇斯就说过：“我认为，如果美国每个公民在吃的方面达到应有的程度，我国剩余农产品肯定就会吃光”。
      舍本求末的方针
      “美国新闻与世界报道”曾经指出，美国农业“生产过剩”的危机，从二十年代就已开始。美国政府为了缓和这种危机，曾花了将近四十年的时间，耗费了数百亿美元，试验过近十种方案。但是不论那一种方案，主要是以牺牲劳动人民和农民利益来保证经营生产和销售农产品的垄断资本家利润，因此不仅不能解决农业危机痼疾，反而使“过剩”危机一天天加深。
    艾森豪威尔执政期间，主要采取三种措施来解决“过剩”危机。第一种是为了保证大农场主的利润和防止价格暴跌，对小麦、玉米、棉花、大米、烟草和花生等六项农产品实行价格支持办法，以维持和保证一定市场价格。这项措施实际上是国家用榨取千百万劳动者所纳的税款，来补贴大农业主在出售他们的产品价格和保证价格之间的差额，并由政府收购或接受剩余农产品的抵押。1958年美国农民纯收入一百三十一亿美元中，就有40％是政府补贴。这些钱绝大部分是落进大农场主的口袋中，例如1956年至1957年财政年度中，年产值在五千美元以上的农场所得的价格补贴占计划拨款总额79％，而占全国农场总数56％的年产值二千五百美元以下的小农场只得9％。而且由于美国政府人为地把农产品和市场隔离起来，减少农产品对市场的供应，以维持农产品的昂贵零售价格，这就保证了垄断资本家经营农产品生产和销售的利润。这项措施的结果，造成了国内市场的萎缩，积存的农产品越来越多。
    其次，艾森豪威尔政府实行限制主要农作物播种面积的政策。美国政府通过所谓“土地银行”，给农民一定数额款项，限制他们生产目前被列为“过剩”的农作物。这样做使得1959年停止播种的耕地面积达二千八百万英亩。
    上述两项措施，都对进行大规模生产和以大宗农产品供应市场的大农场主有利。大农场主往往停止耕种最贫瘠的土地，而集中机器和肥料在已经缩小但比较肥沃的田地上进行精耕细作，通过提高单位面积产量来抵销缩小播种面积减少的产量，并且从政府的价格补贴得到大笔款项，因此农业危机并不使他们吃亏。但是捐税、租税和债务的负担不断增加的中、小农户，他们因为无力进行投资，因此就无法通过提高单位面积产量来弥补缩小播种面积造成的损失，因此日益难以抵抗生产成本较低的大农场的竞争。同时由于中、小农户不能自己生产各种粮食，也像城市居民一样受到政府保持昂贵的零售价格政策的损害。艾森豪威尔在1954年的国情咨文中就承认：“从我们价格支持政策中得到好处的，主要是两百万个比较大的高度机械化农场。其余三百五十万个农场的生产水平如此低下，以致农场主很少从保持高价得到好处”。美国政府这种农业政策，与其说是缓和农业生产危机，不如说是加速中、小农户的破产。
    除采取限制农业生产措施外，美国政府还采取加强国家津贴出口办法、降低价格（往往比成本还要低四分之一）向国外倾销农产品，来减少积存的“剩余”农产品。战后美国农产品出口增加，主要是通过各种“美援”计划供货增加来实现的。美国政府拿从纳税人口袋中弄来的税款，“慷慨”地津贴着三十五种农产品出口。从1954年第四百八十条法案（授权向国外提供剩余物资的主要法律）生效起到1958年6月止，美国政府为补贴出口农产品拨款达四十八亿美元，由于广泛采用倾销手段，今年2月艾森豪威尔向国会提出的一份报告中说，过去三年中，美国输出农产品平均达四十一亿五千万美元。而在1958年，农产品出口占美国输出总额21％。
    由于美国政府不是以提高人民购买力和消费水平来解决根本问题，因此尽管美国政府采取上述几种措施，美国“剩余”农产品仍然有增无已。危机无法解脱
    虽然艾森豪威尔承认农业危机严重，但仍然拿不出什么有效的新办法来。他在农业咨文中建议今年把停止耕种的田地提高到六千万英亩，以减少农作物产量；同时削减对农产品的价格补贴，减少农业开支来缓和当前日益严重的财政危机。“美国新闻与世界报道”指出，美国政府正在积极推行一项所谓“粮食谋求和平”计划，准备通过削价、赠送和以当地货币支付等方式，将大量农产品输到“友好”国家。为此，美国政府最近已陆续派往西欧、西亚和拉丁美洲一些农业专家，研究倾销农产品问题。这些事实说明美国政府企图把日益发展的农业“生产过剩”危机，进一步转嫁到其他国家人民的身上。
    美国报纸对农业前景并不乐观。一些报纸指出，如果停止播种的面积大量增加，“土地银行”开支将从目前三亿五千万美元上升到十亿美元。而降低农产品价格补贴势必使更多中、小农户破产。由于资本主义世界市场日益萎缩，许多农产品输出国家也纷纷加强竞争，1958年和1959年美国农产品输出额都比1957年减少，而1959年又比1958年下降6％。同时美国采取倾销农产品的损人利己政策，越来越引起许多农业品出口国家的不满。
    由于今年11月美国要举行总统和国会议员选举，美国报纸指出，农业问题已成为共和党和民主党在竞选中的尖锐政治问题。今年1月份的美国“新闻周刊”早已作了预言：两党对农业问题也只会是“大吵大嚷”一场，而没有什么新的解决办法。这就是说，美国的农业危机必然将要继续加深下去。（附图片）
