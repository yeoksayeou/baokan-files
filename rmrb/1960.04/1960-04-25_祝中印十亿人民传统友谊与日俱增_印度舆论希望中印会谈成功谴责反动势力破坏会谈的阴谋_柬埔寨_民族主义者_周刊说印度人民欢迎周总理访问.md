Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 24th: Indian public opinion hopes for the success of the ongoing Sino-Indian talks and condemns the conspiracies of reactionary forces to sabotage the talks.

    The "Delhi Times" weekly published an editorial today saying that people are very satisfied to note the speech made by the Chinese Premier at the airport upon his arrival in New Delhi, in which he expressed the hope that India and China will continue to be friendly for many centuries to come. The editorial said, "For centuries, India and China have been friends, and there is no reason to believe that this traditional friendship should not continue unimpaired, benefiting both sides and benefiting the people of Asia, Africa, and the world."

    The weekly, in a dispatch from its special correspondent, reported that people earnestly hope that the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India "can reach a solution satisfactory to both sides." The dispatch, referring to the reception given by the Chinese Ambassador to India, Pan Zili, for the Chinese Premier, said, "This was undoubtedly one of the most pleasant evenings spent at diplomatic receptions in Delhi, and many who attended the reception were very satisfied to note that the atmosphere throughout was warm and friendly. There was no trace of ill feeling anywhere, and the general comment heard was that only those who are hostile to Sino-Indian friendship and cooperation are trying to create an artificially unfriendly atmosphere."

    The Telugu newspaper "Great Andhra" of Madras published an editorial on the 20th, saying, "We heartily welcome the Chinese leaders to India and wish them complete success in their resolute actions to try to resolve differences with our leaders. The friendship between our two countries has existed since ancient times. After India gained independence and China carried out the socialist revolution, this friendship became especially consolidated."

    The editorial condemned the attempts by imperialist countries and certain forces to exploit the differences between China and India for their own benefit. It said, "They believe that the recent tension in our relations with China is an unmissable opportunity to divide and rule Asia. These foreign forces have their agents in India. Therefore, we often hear some strange voices demanding that India abandon its non-alignment policy and join the imperialist camp. Therefore, we hear jarring voices saying that India absolutely cannot hope to maintain peace with China." The editorial said that they even clamored against holding talks with China.

    The editorial said that those who attempt to use the border issue to drag India into the camp of followers are a threat to Asian freedom and are greatly damaging India's independence and freedom.

    The editorial concluded by earnestly hoping that the talks would be successful, so that the friendship between the billion people of India and China would grow with each passing day. The editorial said that the demands of domestic economic construction in India and China do not allow the two countries to be opposed to each other. At the same time, China and India need to jointly support the struggle of African countries to break free from colonial shackles.

    The Punjabi newspaper "New Age" published an editorial on the 23rd, expressing its belief that the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India on the border issue would be successful.

    The editorial said that the attention of the people of China and India is focused on Delhi, and they all expect the border issue to be resolved.

    According to "Freedom News" on the 22nd, Jyoti Basu, a leader of the Communist Party of India in West Bengal, spoke at an election rally in Calcutta on the 21st, referring the Sino-Indian border dispute, saying that the dispute should be resolved through peaceful negotiations. He said that the people of all India are demanding that the Prime Ministers of China and India meet and hold talks.

    According to Indian News Agency, Bhavdhari, a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council, said in a conversation in Lucknow on the 22nd, "I naturally hope that the Nehru-Zhou Enlai talks currently being held in Delhi will be successful. The two Prime Ministers said that both countries need peace to carry out their economic construction. They expressed the sentiments of hundreds of millions of people in both countries when they said this. Today, this is the need of history. I know that hundreds of millions of people on both sides of the Himalayas are praying for the success of the great mission being carried out by the two Prime Ministers."

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, April 24th: The Cambodian "Nationalist" weekly published a commentary on the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' talks on the 23rd, saying that although some Indian organizations do not want Sino-Indian friendship, most Indian people welcome the Chinese Premier. "The Chinese Premier is going to talk with Nehru with sincerity in order to resolve the border issue between the two countries."

    The weekly said, "This Chinese leader bravely went to India with sincerity after knowing that some people deliberately created a bad atmosphere against him." "If people take into account the results achieved by the people of Burma and China in resolving similar border issues, people will better understand this sincerity."

    The commentary said, "We firmly believe that the meeting between Zhou Enlai and Nehru is very important."

    The commentary said, "Whether or not this meeting can find a solution, the direct meeting of these two Prime Ministers is already the first step towards lasting reconciliation. We hope that the two friends of Cambodia will achieve good results in the talks, so that the two neighboring countries can live in friendship and understanding."

    祝中印十亿人民传统友谊与日俱增
    印度舆论希望中印会谈成功谴责反动势力破坏会谈的阴谋
    柬埔寨“民族主义者”周刊说印度人民欢迎周总理访问
    新华社新德里24日电　印度舆论盼望目前正在进行的中印会谈成功，并谴责反动势力破坏会谈的阴谋活动。
    “德里时代”周报今天发表社论说，人们非常满意地注意到中国总理在到达新德里时在机场发表的讲话，他在讲话中表示希望印度和中国在今后许多世纪中继续友好下去。社论说，“若干世纪以来，印度和中国一直是朋友，没有理由认为这种传统的友谊不应当不受损害地继续保持下去，而使双方得到好处，并使亚非和全世界人民得到好处。”
    这家周报在它的特派记者的电讯中报道，人们恳切希望中印两国总理的会谈“能够达成双方都满意的解决办法。”这篇电讯谈到中国驻印度大使潘自力为中国总理举行的招待会时说，“这无疑是在德里在外交招待会上度过的最愉快的夜晚之一，出席招待会的很多人非常满意地注意到招待会上的气氛自始至终都是热烈友好的。在任何地方都没有一点恶感的痕迹，人们听到的普遍的议论是：只有敌视中印友谊和合作的人才企图制造一种人为的不友好的气氛。”
    马德拉斯的泰鲁固文“大安德拉报”20日发表社论说，“我们衷心欢迎中国领导人到印度来，并祝他们设法同我国领导人解决分歧的果断行动完全成功。我们两国的友谊自古以来就已存在。在印度获得了独立和中国进行了社会主义革命以后，这种友谊变得格外巩固了。”
    社论谴责帝国主义国家和某些势力企图利用中印两国之间的分歧为它们的利益服务。它说，“它们认为，最近我们同中国关系上的紧张状态是分裂和统治亚洲的不可错过的机会。这些外国势力在印度有它们的代理人。因此我们常常听到一些奇怪的声音，要求印度放弃不结盟方针和参加帝国主义阵营。因此我们听到刺耳的声音说，印度绝对不能希望同中国保持和平。”社论说，他们甚至叫嚷反对同中国举行会谈。
    社论说，那些企图利用边界问题把印度拉入仆从者阵营的人，是对亚洲自由的一种威胁，他们正在大大损害印度的独立和自由。
    社论最后再次殷切地希望会谈得到成功，使印度和中国十亿人民之间的友谊与日俱增。社论说，印度和中国国内经济建设上的要求也不容许两个国家彼此对立。同时，中国和印度需要共同来支援非洲国家摆脱殖民枷锁的斗争。
    旁遮普文“新世纪报”23日发表社论，表示相信中印两国总理就边界问题举行的会谈将会获得成功。
    社论说，印中两国人民的注意力都集中在德里，都期望边界问题得到解决。
    据“自由报”22日报道，西孟加拉邦印度共产党领袖乔蒂·巴苏21日在加尔各答的一个竞选集会上讲话时谈到中印边界争端，他说，这个争端应当通过和平谈判来解决。他说，全印度人民都要求中印两国总理举行会晤和会谈。
    据印度新闻社消息，印度北方邦立法会议议员巴弗德里22日在勒克瑙的一次谈话中说，“我自然希望目前正在德里举行的尼赫鲁和周恩来的会谈获得成功。两国总理说，两国都需要和平以进行它们的经济建设。他们这样说时表达了两国亿万人民的情绪。今天，这是历史的需要。我知道喜马拉雅山脉两边有数以亿计的人祈求两国总理所进行的伟大任务获得成功。”
    新华社金边24日电　柬埔寨“民族主义者”周刊23日就中印总理会谈发表评论说，虽然某些印度组织不希望中印友好，但是大部分印度人民对中国总理表示欢迎。“中国总理是怀着诚意前往同尼赫鲁会谈，以便解决两国边界问题的”。
    这家周刊说，“这位中国领袖知道某些人故意制造反对他的恶劣气氛后，他还是勇敢地怀着诚意到印度去。”“如果人们再考虑到缅甸和中国人民在解决类似的边界问题方面所取得的结果后，人们就更加理解这种诚意了”。
    评论说，“我们深信，周恩来同尼赫鲁会晤，是非常重要的。”
    评论说，“不论这次会谈是否能找到办法，这两位总理的直接会晤，已经朝着持久和解走了第一步。我们希望，柬埔寨的两个朋友在会谈中取得良好的结果，从而使这两个邻国能够友好和谅解地相处。”
