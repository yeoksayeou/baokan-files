Comrades,

I fully agree with and resolutely support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. These reports showcase the magnificent prospects of our country's continued leap forward in socialist construction, and express the lofty aspirations of our people to continue to leap forward and to be sure to continue to leap forward.

Since 1958, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, under the brilliant illumination of the general line for socialist construction, and driven by the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, Chinese women have been largely liberated from household labor and have participated in various socialist construction endeavors, demonstrating soaring enthusiasm and unparalleled initiative and creativity. This has greatly promoted the high-speed construction of socialism and has played a decisive role in propelling the women's movement into a new stage of complete emancipation. Now, the broad masses of women have been and are being trained to become skilled social laborers with a high degree of socialist awareness and a certain level of technical and cultural proficiency.

From their personal experiences, Chinese women have profoundly realized that only by holding high the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes can we develop socialist construction at high speed, ensure the sustained leap forward of the national economy, and continuously realize the complete emancipation of women. The tasks for developing the national economy in 1960, as proposed in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report, will better implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and strive for a continued, comprehensive, and better leap forward in the national economy. The proposals in Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report to strive to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program for 1956-1967 two or three years ahead of schedule, all these great calls will surely receive the warm support and resolute implementation of the broad masses of women throughout the country. This year's "March 8th" International Working Women's Day is a festival for hundreds of millions of women in our country to pledge to achieve a greater leap forward in 1960.

People are the most active factor in the productive forces. Under the strong leadership of the Party, launching mass movements on a large scale, universally mobilizing and rationally organizing the nation's labor force, and more fully leveraging the enthusiasm and creativity of the laborers are important keys to promoting the high-speed development of socialist construction. Our Party and state have always attached great importance to leveraging the great strength of the masses of women. Since the founding of the country, the thorough implementation of democratic reforms and socialist transformation has paved increasingly broad paths for women to participate in social labor. Especially in the past two years, driven by the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the people's communes, the broad masses of women in both urban and rural areas have rapidly and universally participated in social labor. Rural people's communes have organized almost all women with labor capabilities to participate in various labor activities, and women have become a main force in agricultural production. The number of female employees nationwide has surged from more than three million in 1957 to more than eight million in 1959. Several million family members of employees and urban street residents have also participated in production, living, and service organizations run by urban people's communes and streets, as well as other social labor.

Currently, both urban and rural areas still contain abundant labor potential; a portion of women with labor capabilities in cities have not yet participated in social labor. Therefore, further mobilizing all women with labor capabilities to participate in social labor remains an important task for us at present. We must truly achieve: making all women laborers participate in the labor front in the shortest possible time.

The women who have already participated in industrial and agricultural production and other fronts, after two years of practice, the vast majority of them have mastered the technology, and many have become experts and all-rounders. In order to promote the high-speed development of social productive forces, we must vigorously promote mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. Because a large number of women are now engaged in manual operations, they are more urgently demanding a technological revolution. Now, women laboring on all fronts, from industrial and agricultural production, life, transportation, finance and trade, services to cultural, educational and health fronts, are with unprecedented heroic spirit, actively involved in the increase production and practice economy movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, their slogan is "Try every means to carry out innovation, dare to think and dare to do to make creations". Look at the women in the second workshop of the motor factory of Qixinggang People's Commune in Chongqing! Now they are wearing white overalls skillfully manufacturing fluorescent lamp ballasts. Not long ago, they didn't even know what a ballast looked like. The workshop director, Xia Qingming, is a forty-year-old housewife, who used to be an activist in street work, and was respectfully called "Mother Xia" by the masses. Under the call of the Party's all-people industrialization, she led more than twenty middle-aged housewives to run a motor factory. If they didn't understand the technology, they bought a ballast, learned while dismantling it, carefully counted how many resistor chips there were, how many layers of enameled wire there were, and how many turns there were in each layer; and then they just started doing it. At the beginning, it was all manual operation, but the tide of the technical revolution hit the motor factory, and they wanted mechanization and automation, but they always felt it was a bit too high to reach. One day, they studied Chairman Mao's work: "Who says chicken feathers can't fly to the sky?" At this moment, Mother Xia and the twenty-odd women realized: Yes! Our street women started a factory empty-handed, didn't that also send chicken feathers to the sky! Mechanization and automation must also be allowed to fly to the sky! Chairman Mao's thought illuminated their hearts, and their enthusiasm came immediately. They fought hard for three days and three nights, and the motorized winding machine was finally manufactured successfully by them, increasing efficiency by ten times. Chicken feathers flew to the sky again. The revolutionary spirit of Mother Xia and the women of the motor factory shows that no matter which front women are working on, as long as they listen to the Party, follow Chairman Mao, establish lofty ambitions, liberate their minds, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, overcome inferiority, continuously revolutionize, continuously create, from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, they will definitely be able to make great creations.

In order to further liberate women's labor force, more universally mobilize women with labor capabilities to participate in social labor, and enable women to more actively participate in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and strive to study political culture; we must vigorously run collective welfare and social service undertakings, and further realize the socialization of household labor, transforming the scattered, trivial, and ignorance-inducing household labor into collective, large-scale socialist economic undertakings. At the same time, running collective welfare undertakings and social service undertakings is also a transformation of the lifestyle of the old society, making the collective lifestyle gradually become the main lifestyle of socialist society, is a great revolution in life, is a major issue related to developing the socialist front, enhancing collectivist thinking, and raising communist consciousness. Therefore, running collective welfare undertakings and social service undertakings is not only for life, but also for production, for ideological transformation, is a major political task.

The great Lenin gave such a high evaluation to such an undertaking, he said: "Only where the petty housekeeping is transformed on a mass scale into socialist large-scale economy, is there a real emancipation of women, a real communism." We must unswervingly follow the path indicated by Lenin.

Since 1958, with the development and improvement of the people's communes, urban and rural collective welfare undertakings and social service undertakings have greatly developed. By the end of 1959, four hundred million people in rural areas nationwide were eating in public canteens, accounting for about 73% of the total population of the national rural people's communes. Urban public canteens have also been rapidly developing recently, and the number of people eating there is increasing. Tens of millions of children nationwide, from birth to preschool age, are living happily in nurseries, kindergartens, and kindergartens, where they receive better education than at home.

At present, in urban and rural areas, it is also necessary to universally develop and strive to run public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and kindergartens well, and gradually satisfy the demands of all those who voluntarily eat in public canteens and voluntarily send their children to nurseries. At the same time, it is also a glorious task placed before us to carefully nurture these communist seedlings that have already grown, so that they will continue to grow and continue to improve. Now, both in urban and rural areas, the broad masses of people are developing from organizing mainly household labor to comprehensively organizing collective life; making canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and service stations form a network and a set; further improving business management, saving manpower and material resources, and more fully exerting the superiority of collective life and social service undertakings. Many places are organizing joint canteens and comprehensively developing service undertakings centered on canteens. For example, a service station of the Xitaikang Road People's Commune in Zhengzhou City is praised by the masses as a "omnipotent service station". In fact, this is a joint processing factory for twelve canteens. The processing of staple foods and non-staple foods has all been mechanized, and steam is used for cooking, saving 60% of the labor force, 83% of the coal, and about 60% of the time. Moreover, the twelve canteens are managed in a unified way, which is convenient for improving business management and also convenient for the masses to eat. They have also established eleven departments centered on the canteen: health care department, marriage service department, laundry department, shoe repair department, sock patching department, sewing department, tinsmith department, savings and sales department, barber shop, small shop, and mobile department (temporarily taking care of children, etc.). This kind of "omnipotent service station" and "omnipotent canteen" are springing up everywhere like mushrooms after rain, praised by everyone and praised by everyone. Some places have also seen a higher form of maternal and child welfare organization - maternal and child Kangfu Paradise, such as a fairly large-scale maternal and child Kangfu Paradise established by the Fenglong People's Commune in Weiyuan Yi, Hui and Miao Autonomous County in Sichuan, which unifies the leadership of ten maternity hospitals, three hundred and three nurseries, and two hundred and twenty kindergartens, making maternal and child health care and education work a system, from the mother's pregnancy, delivery, pre- and post-natal rest to the baby's admission to the nursery, and early childhood education are all included, thereby greatly improving and improving the level of maternal and child health care work and preschool children's protection and education work, and saving manpower and material resources. These advanced collective living and social service organizations are precisely the model for transforming scattered household labor into large-scale socialist economic undertakings, are extremely valuable new things, and we should carefully cultivate, summarize, and promote their experience, and train a large number of cooks, caregivers, nurses, and kindergarten teachers to help them prosper and grow universally.

The reason why women in our country can participate in social labor so rapidly and universally and develop collective living and social service undertakings is mainly because the people's communes have been universally established under the illumination of the general line of socialist construction and on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. As Chairman Mao taught us: "Only by running the people's communes well can we achieve the complete emancipation of women." Facts have proved that whether in rural or urban areas, as long as the people's communes are established, they can absorb the vast number of women to participate in social labor, rapidly develop public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and other social service undertakings, realize the socialization of household labor, develop new relationships between people, make family life more democratic, harmonious, and happy, and enable children to receive better social education. Our women must, together with the people of the whole country, vigorously develop urban people's communes and strive to promote the continuous and sound development of rural people's communes; thereby encouraging and organizing broader masses of women to make greater contributions in the ranks of building socialism, and continuously promote the cause of women's complete emancipation.

Our women have also profoundly realized from their personal experiences that in order to do all work well and ensure greater victories in the future, we must continue to implement putting politics in command. The Chinese Communist Party is the supreme commander of the Chinese people in carrying out revolution and construction. The most fundamental thing about putting politics in command is that the Party should be in command, that Marxism-Leninism should be in command, and that the thought of Marxism-Leninism, the universal truth, and the integration of the practice of the Chinese revolution - Mao Zedong Thought - should be in command. Therefore, resolutely listening to the Party and arming oneself with Mao Zedong Thought has become the conscious and urgent demand of the broad masses of women. Recently, a wave of studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works has been set off among the broad masses of the people. In Shandong Province, there are 7 million women, and in Harbin City, there are 210,000 women participating in the study. Many working-class and peasant women in many places have persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works for a long time after becoming literate. Their spirit of study has become a good example to spur me to study hard. Let me introduce here an old lady of 55 years old, Wang Peixia, who is the director of the residents' committee of Jiamusi City. She became literate in 1954 and started studying Chairman Mao's works in 1955. She has persisted in studying for five years. She has finished reading Volumes 1 and 2 of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong and studied "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People", "All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers", and many other works. She often reads Party documents and articles by central responsible comrades. She herself said that studying Chairman Mao's works has made her thinking brighter, her enthusiasm greater, and her working methods more numerous. She understands who is the enemy and who is the friend, and she can stand firm and unite the masses in her work. She understands the importance of following the mass line, exerting collective strength, consulting with the masses in everything, and working with the cadres to study together. She cares about the suffering of the masses everywhere. Many women are willing to talk to her intimately, and even children go to her when they have difficulties. The work of the residents' committee where she is located is improving day by day, and in 1958 it became an advanced unit in an all-round leap forward. The example of the old lady Wang Peixia tells us that as long as one is determined, all laborers can study Chairman Mao's works, and anyone can learn well and use them well.

Speaking of women's work cadres, in general, they are paying attention to studying political theory, but the level is not high; therefore, we ourselves must first seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, and continuously improve our political and theoretical level, keep up with the Party's requirements politically and ideologically, and in our work, and keep up well, keep up closely, and keep up in a timely manner. Only if the women's work cadres study well first can they, under the leadership of the Party, lead the broad masses of women to study more universally and deeply, and carry out the wave of studying Chairman Mao's works that has already been set off more widely, more persistently, and more deeply; and truly transform our generation into new people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

In order to rapidly and universally improve the political, theoretical, and technical level of the masses of women, we must also strive to learn cultural and scientific knowledge. Many women have already realized the importance of learning. They said, "Communism is heaven, you can't go there without culture. To overcome the technical barrier, you must occupy the cultural mountain." Many women who have not yet become literate are working hard to learn culture; many women who have already become literate are studying in primary, intermediate, and advanced spare-time schools. We must all speed up, study diligently, move forward step by step, continuously improve, and strive to climb the peak of scientific culture.

Comrades, on our vast land, whether in rural or urban areas, whether in coastal or mountainous areas, as long as you get close to the masses of women, you can see them enthusiastically supporting the three red banners, using countless poems to express their heartfelt gratitude to the Party and Chairman Mao. They are all beaming, smiling, energetic, high-spirited, full of vigor, and full of energy. They are leaping like dragons and tigers, chasing each other, helping each other, and working bravely on all fronts of socialist construction, striving for a full house of red in 1960, and red to the end. Our motherland was poor and blank, and our women were even poorer and blank. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our masses of women are determined to be thorough revolutionaries, and will definitely carry out the socialist revolution to the end together with the people of the whole country. We must make greater achievements in building China into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern national defense, and modern science and culture in a not too long period of time in the future, and strive for the great ideal of communism in the future!

    人民公社是我国妇女彻底解放的道路
    全国妇联书记处第一书记罗琼的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意和坚决拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告，和人大常委会的工作报告。在这几个报告里，展示出了我国社会主义建设继续跃进的宏伟图景，表达了我国人民一定要继续跃进，一定能够继续跃进的雄心壮志。
    1958年以来，我国妇女在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进和人民公社的推动下，大批地从家务劳动中解放出来，参加了建设社会主义的各项劳动，鼓足了冲天干劲，发挥了无比的积极性和创造性。这对高速度建设社会主义起了极大的促进作用；对推动妇女运动进入彻底解放的新阶段起了决定作用；现在广大妇女群众已经并正在锻炼成为有高度社会主义觉悟、有一定技术、文化水平的熟练的社会劳动者。
    我国妇女从亲身体验中深刻地认识到，只有高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，才能高速度发展社会主义建设事业，保证国民经济持续跃进，才能不断地实现妇女的彻底解放。李富春副总理报告中所提出的1960年发展国民经济的任务，更好地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，争取国民经济继续的全面的更好的跃进；谭震林副总理报告中所提出的争取提前两年或三年实现1956年至1967年全国农业发展纲要；所有这些伟大的号召，一定能得到全国广大妇女群众的热烈拥护和坚决贯彻执行。今年“三八”国际劳动妇女节，就是我国亿万妇女争取1960年实现更大跃进的誓师的节日。
    人是生产力中最活跃的因素。在党的坚强领导下，大搞群众运动，普遍动员和合理组织全国的劳动力，更充分地发挥劳动者的积极性和创造性，是促进社会主义建设高速度发展的重要关键。我们党和国家历来非常重视发挥妇女群众的伟大力量，从建国以来，由于彻底进行了民主改革和社会主义改造，就为妇女参加社会劳动开辟了日益宽广的道路；特别近两年来，在工农业生产大跃进和人民公社推动下，全国城乡广大妇女迅速地普遍地参加了社会劳动。农村人民公社把有劳动能力的妇女，几乎全部组织起来参加各项劳动，妇女成为农业生产上的一支主力军。全国女职工人数由1957年的三百多万人跃增到1959年的八百多万人。还有几百万职工家属和城市街道居民妇女参加了城市人民公社办的、街道办的生产、生活、服务组织以及其他社会劳动。
    当前在城市和农村，都还蕴藏着丰富的劳动潜力；城市还有一部分有劳动能力的妇女没有参加社会劳动。所以更进一步发动有劳动能力的妇女全部参加社会劳动，仍然是我们当前的一项重要的任务。我们一定要真正做到：在尽可能短的时间内，使全部妇女劳动力，参加到劳动战线上去。
    已经参加工农业生产和其他战线上的妇女，经过两年的实践，绝大多数人已经掌握了技术，许多人变成能手和多面手。为了促进社会生产力高速度的发展，我们必须大搞机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化；由于大量妇女现在正从事手工操作，她们更迫切要求技术大革命。现在不论在哪一条战线上劳动的妇女，从工农业生产、生活、交通、财贸、服务以至文教卫生等战线上的妇女们，都以前所未有的英勇气概，踊跃投入以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，她们的口号是“千方百计搞革新，敢想敢干闹创造”。看看重庆市七星岗人民公社电机厂第二车间的妇女吧！现在她们穿着白色的工作服熟练地制造着日光灯整流器。不久以前，她们连整流器是什么样子也不知道。车间主任夏庆明，是四十多岁的家庭妇女，过去是街道工作中的积极分子，被群众尊称为夏妈妈，在党的全民办工业的号召下，她带动了二十几位中年家庭妇女办电机厂。不懂技术，买了一个整流器，边拆边学，仔细地数有多少个电阻片，有多少层漆包线，每层有多少圈；就照样干起来了。开始完全是手工操作，技术革命的浪潮打进了电机厂，她们想要机械化、自动化，但总觉得有点高不可攀。有一天她们学习了毛主席的著作：“谁说鸡毛不能上天？”这下子，夏妈妈和二十几位妇女开了窍门：对呀！我们街道妇女空手办起了工厂，不也是叫鸡毛上天了！机械化、自动化也非得让它上天不行！毛主席的思想照亮了她们的心，干劲马上来了，她们苦战了三天三夜，电动化的绕线机终于从她们手里制造成功了，工效提高了十倍，鸡毛又一次上了天。夏妈妈和电机厂妇女的革命气魄，说明了不论在哪一条战线劳动的妇女，只要听党的话，跟着毛主席走，树雄心、立大志，解放思想，敢想敢说敢干，克服自卑，不断革命，不断创造，由小到大，由土到洋，就一定能够做出伟大的创造。
    为了更进一步解放妇女劳动力，更普遍地动员有劳动能力的妇女参加社会劳动，使妇女能够更积极地参加技术革新和技术革命运动，努力学习政治文化；我们必须大力办好集体生活福利和社会服务事业，更进一步实现家务劳动社会化，把分散的、繁琐的、使人愚昧的家务劳动改造成为集体的、大规模的社会主义经济事业。同时办好集体福利事业和社会服务事业，又是变革旧社会的生活方式，使集体生活方式逐步成为社会主义社会的主要生活方式，是生活的大革命，是关系到发展社会主义阵地，增进集体主义思想和提高共产主义觉悟的重大问题。因此办好集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业，既是为着生活，又是为着生产，为着思想改造，是重大的政治任务。
    伟大的列宁对于这样的事业给予多么高的评价，他说：“只有在开始把琐碎家务普遍改造为社会主义大经济的地方，才有真正的妇女解放，才有真正的共产主义。”我们一定要坚定不移地循着列宁指引的道路前进。
    1958年以来，随着人民公社的发展和提高，城乡集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业，都有很大发展。到1959年底，全国农村有四亿人在公共食堂吃饭，约占全国农村人民公社人口总数的73％。城市公共食堂最近也在飞跃发展，吃饭的人数越来越多。全国城乡从出生到学前的儿童，有几千万人在哺乳室、托儿所、幼儿园幸福地生活着，他们在那里得到了比家庭更好的教养。
    当前在城市和农村，还要普遍发展和努力办好公共食堂、哺乳室、托儿所、幼儿园，逐步使一切自愿在公共食堂吃饭，自愿送孩子入托的人们，都能满足自己的要求。同时，更需要精心培育这些已经成长起来的共产主义幼芽，使之不断地成长，不断地提高，又是摆在我们面前的一项光荣的任务。现在不论城市和农村，广大人民群众都正在由组织主要家务劳动，向全面组织集体生活发展；使食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、服务站成网成套；更进一步改善经营管理，节约人力物力，更充分地发挥集体生活和社会服务事业的优越性。不少地方正在组织联合性的食堂和以食堂为中心全面发展服务事业。例如郑州市西太康路人民公社的一个服务站，被群众称扬为“万能服务站”，实际上这是十二个食堂的联合加工厂，主食品加工和副食品加工全部实现了机械化，用蒸气做饭，劳动力节省了60％，煤节省了83％，时间节省了60％左右，而且把十二个食堂统一管理，既便于改进经营管理，又便于群众吃饭。她们又以食堂为中心设立了十一个部——卫生保健部、结婚服务部、洗衣部、修鞋部、上袜底部、缝纫部、白铁部、储蓄代售部、理发部、小卖部、机动部（临时收托孩子等）。这种“万能服务站”，“万能食堂”，正像雨后春笋，到处生长，人人称颂，个个赞扬。有些地方又出现了一种妇幼福利组织的高级形式——母子康福乐园，例如四川威远彝族回族苗族自治县奉龙人民公社设立的一个相当大规模的母子康福乐园，统一领导十个妇产院，三百零三个托儿所，二百二十个幼儿园，使妇幼保健和保教工作成为一个体系，从母亲怀孕、临产、产前产后休息到婴儿入托、幼儿教育等全部包下来；从而大大提高和改进了妇幼保健工作及学前儿童保教工作的水平，又节省了人力、物力。这些高级的集体生活和社会服务组织，正是把分散的家务劳动改造成为大规模的社会主义经济事业的模型，是极可宝贵的新生事物，我们应该细心地加以培养、总结和推广它们的经验，大量培训炊事员、保育、护士和幼儿教师，帮助它们欣欣向荣地普遍地生长起来。
    我国妇女所以能够如此迅速地普遍地参加社会劳动、发展集体生活和社会服务事业，主要是由于在社会主义建设总路线照耀下，在工农业生产大跃进的基础上，普遍地建立了人民公社。正如毛主席教导我们的：“只有办好人民公社，才是妇女彻底解放的道路”。事实证明，不论在农村或城市，只要人民公社建立起来了，就能够吸收广大妇女参加社会劳动，迅速发展公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园和其他社会服务事业，实现家务劳动的社会化，发展人与人的新关系，使家庭生活更加民主和睦和幸福，使孩子们得到更好的社会教养。我们妇女一定要和全国人民一起，大力发展城市人民公社，努力促进农村人民公社不断地健全的发展；从而将鼓舞和组织更广大的妇女在建设社会主义的行列中作出更大的贡献，不断地推进妇女的彻底解放事业。
    我们妇女又从亲身体验中深刻认识要做好一切工作，保证今后取得更大的胜利；必须继续实行政治挂帅。中国共产党是中国人民进行革命和建设的最高统帅，政治挂帅最根本的就是党来挂帅，就是马克思列宁主义挂帅，就是马克思列宁主义普遍真理和中国革命实践相结合的思想——毛泽东思想挂帅。因此坚决听党的话，用毛泽东思想武装起来，已经成为广大妇女群众自觉的迫切的要求。最近一个时期，在广大人民群众中掀起了学习马列主义、毛主席著作的热潮。山东省就有七百万妇女、哈尔滨市就有二十一万妇女参加学习，许多地方的工农劳动妇女从脱盲以后，就长期坚持学习毛主席著作，她们的学习精神，成为鞭策我自己努力学习的好榜样。让我在这里介绍一位五十五岁的老大娘王佩霞，她是佳木斯市居民委员会的主任，1954年脱盲，1955年开始学习毛主席著作，五年来一直坚持学习。她读完了毛泽东选集第一第二卷，学习了“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，“论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”等许多著作；她经常阅读党的文件、中央负责同志的文章。她自己说学习毛主席著作，使她思想越变越亮，干劲越来越大，工作办法越来越多。她懂得了谁是敌人，谁是朋友，在工作中就能够站稳立场，团结群众。她懂得了走群众路线，发挥集体力量，遇事和群众商量，做工作和干部共同研究。她处处关心群众疾苦，许多妇女愿意和她谈知心话，连孩子们有困难也去找她。她所在的居民委员会的工作，一天比一天进步，1958年成为全面跃进的先进单位。王佩霞老大娘的榜样，告诉我们只要自己有决心，一切劳动者谁都能学习毛主席著作，谁都能学得好，用得好。
    再说到妇女工作干部，一般来说，都正在注意学习政治理论，但是水平还不高；因此我们自己，首先要认真学习马列主义、毛主席著作，不断地提高政治理论水平，从政治思想上、从工作上跟上党的要求，而且跟得好，跟得紧，跟得及时。也只有妇女工作干部先学习好，才能在党的领导下，带动广大妇女群众更普遍更深入地学习，把现在已经掀起的学习毛主席著作的热潮，更广泛更持久更深入地开展下去；把我们这一代，真正改造成为用毛泽东思想武装起来的新人。
    为着迅速地普遍地提高妇女群众的政治、理论和技术水平，还必须努力学习文化科学知识。许多妇女已经体会到学习的重要意义。她们说“共产主义是天堂，没有文化不能上，要攻克技术关，必须占领文化山”。许多没有脱盲的妇女，正在努力学习文化；已经脱盲的妇女，很多人正在初级、中级、高级业余学校学习。我们大家还必须快马加鞭，勤学苦钻，步步前进，不断提高，努力攀登科学文化高峰。
    各位代表：在我们辽阔广大的土地上，不论到农村或者城市，不论到沿海或者山区，只要接近妇女群众，就可以看到她们热情洋溢地拥护三面红旗，用无数的诗歌来表达她们对党和毛主席的衷心的感激。她们个个喜气洋洋，笑逐颜开，精神奋发，斗志昂扬，干劲十足，龙腾虎跃，你追我赶，互相协助，英勇劳动在建设社会主义的各个战线上，努力争取1960年的满堂红，红到底。我们祖国是一穷二白，我们妇女是更穷更白，在党和毛主席的领导下，我们妇女群众是坚决要当彻底的革命派，一定和全国人民一起把社会主义革命进行到底，一定要为在今后一个不长的时期内，把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代国防和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家做出更大的成就，并为将来实现共产主义伟大理想而努力奋斗！
