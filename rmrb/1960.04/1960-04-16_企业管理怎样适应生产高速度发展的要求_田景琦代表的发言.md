How Enterprise Management Adapts to the Requirements of High-Speed Production Development
Speech by Representative Tian Jingqi

    I fully support the reports made to the conference by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and I will resolutely implement them after returning to the factory. Now, I would like to report to the conference on the situation of the Great Leap Forward in our factory's production:

    I. Believing in the Party and Relying on the Party is the Guarantee of Victory

    Chairman Mao taught us: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party; these are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then nothing can be accomplished." To run a socialist enterprise well, we must never depart from these two principles. Over the past two years, we have deeply realized that the more difficulties we encounter, the more we must listen to the Party, resolutely implement the Party's instructions, fully mobilize the masses, and overcome all difficulties to ensure the sustained development of production.

    From the beginning of its construction, our factory has adhered to the Party's policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and adopted the measures of prioritizing production over welfare and carrying out construction and production simultaneously. As a result, we saved funds, gained time, and accelerated the progress of factory construction. It took only one year and ten months from preparation to completion, and we comprehensively put it into production in January 1958 ahead of schedule. On the basis of the victory of the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, we further implemented the Party's General Line and achieved a sustained Great Leap Forward. In just six months, we reached the designed capacity, and in September 1959, we completed the various production targets of the Second Five-Year Plan assigned to our factory by the state ahead of schedule. At present, production has exceeded more than four times the designed capacity. The profits turned over to the state in two years can rebuild two factories the same size as ours. We have resolutely implemented the Party's policy of walking on two legs, relying on our own efforts, and using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to build new workshops such as complex cutting tools and new drill bit technology. Based on the urgent needs of production, we disregarded professional restrictions, tapped potential, and built more than ten satellite factories, including a steel branch (including steelmaking, ironmaking, rolling, refractory materials, electrode, cement, and other workshops) and chemical, grinding wheel, brick-making, and lumber factories. This played a significant role in solving material difficulties and ensuring the sustained leap forward in production. In addition, we helped build and contracted to build more than ten small and medium-sized factories. In terms of supporting the "four modernizations" of agriculture, our factory actively mobilized the masses and adopted the method of assigning responsibility to the factory headquarters for communes, workshops for management areas, and work sections for production teams. We helped Qinglong Commune in the suburbs of Chengdu establish eleven factories and stations, including machinery and fertilizer factories. We semi-mechanized fourteen pig farms with more than a hundred pigs each, and also helped the commune repair and improve a large number of farm implements and transportation tools.

    These achievements are mainly attributed to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. It is the result of adhering to putting politics in command, carrying out the struggle between the two roads, and constantly criticizing the right-leaning erroneous ideas that transferring power would "cause chaos," that diversified operations are "not doing the proper work, dispersing energy, and affecting the production of gauges and cutting tools," that helping new factories is "being nosy," and that the Great Leap Forward is a "quantitative leap forward, without a technological leap forward." It is the victory of the Party's General Line, the victory of the Great Leap Forward, and the victory of vigorously launching mass movements.

    II. Believing in the Masses and Relying on the Masses is the Source of Strength

    The mass line is the Party's fundamental line. Under the socialist system, the working class is the master of the enterprise. Therefore, to run a socialist enterprise well, we must resolutely rely on workers to participate in enterprise management. There are many forms for workers to participate in management, and participating in group management is the most effective and most basic form. The practice of vigorously launching mass movements in our factory over the past two years has proven that group management is the foundation of enterprise management. The production group is both the starting point for a vigorous mass movement and the landing point for doing various tasks in a solid and down-to-earth manner. The key to strengthening group management lies in whether we dare to delegate the powers that the group should manage to the group. This is one of the main signs to measure whether an enterprise leader believes in the masses, and it is also the focus of the struggle between the two lines in our factory's enterprise management over the past two years, whether to rely only on a few "experts" or to rely on the masses to vigorously launch mass movements.

    The process of strengthening group management and delegating power in our factory is a process of continuously implementing the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" and decentralized management. It started with workers participating in daily production management, developed to vigorously launching group economic accounting, participating in economic management, and then developed to participating in technical management, group compilation of processes and conducting design and quality inspection, and even participating in comprehensive enterprise management. In this way, the content of group management has become richer, showing strong vitality, and professional management also has a broad mass base. Combining professional management and mass management further implements the Party's policy of combining centralized leadership and vigorously launching mass movements, constantly adjusting the contradictions between production relations and productive forces, the superstructure and the economic base, and promoting a sustained leap forward in production.

    (1) Through the great rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, the sense of responsibility of the workers as masters has been greatly strengthened, and they strongly demanded to participate in enterprise management and reform unreasonable rules and regulations. During the "double anti" movement, the masses posted more than 100,000 big-character posters, about 80% of which were aimed at management work. One big-character poster wrote: "Coming to work early in the morning, a lot of tasks are waiting. Borrowing tools, borrowing drawings, running around takes time. Arguing here, quarreling there, talking more, doing less, everything has to be done by cadres, how can the master be a good one." The factory Party committee and administrative leaders resolutely supported the demands of the masses, broke with conventions, delegated power, reformed the system, established group management organizations and systems, and implemented the policy of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." As a result, management work has been greatly strengthened, the entire factory has taken on a new look, and many major technological innovations have been achieved, countless production bottlenecks have been overcome, plans have been overfulfilled again and again, quality has improved and improved, costs have decreased month by month, and the Great Leap Forward in production has been promoted. Workers wrote poems praising: "Today, I am happy to see the gate of heaven open (referring to the delegation of power), we arrange production ourselves. Tools and drawings are prepared early, heroes have the skills to use. No need for three or five years, old brands of Britain and the United States will be ranked behind." Since then, the Party's mass line has taken root in the minds of cadres in our factory, and production groups have gradually grown up.

    (2) Practice has proven that the more leaders believe in the masses and delegate power to the groups, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, and the more they can give full play to their infinite wisdom and strength. At the beginning of 1959, the masses urgently demanded to continue delegating power and participate in economic management, and put forward the request of "how can we be good masters if we don't manage finances." The factory Party committee and administrative leaders adhered to the Party's policy of combining centralized leadership and vigorously launching mass movements, resolutely implemented the instructions of the provincial and municipal Party committees on the decentralized management system, supported the demands of the masses, and delegated financial power to the groups. In May of last year, the mass movement of economic accounting based on group accounting was launched rapidly and vigorously throughout the factory, reversing the bleak situation of a few people doing cost accounting in the past, and creating a new situation where everyone is accounting and everyone is managing finances, pushing the movement of increasing production and practicing economy to a new climax, and the entire enterprise management work has entered a new stage. The development of the group accounting system has also greatly promoted the development of technological revolution, and the development of technological revolution has promoted economic accounting. For example, many groups tried every means to save tools. In May of last year alone, the consumption of tools and fixtures decreased by 30%. In the past few months, although production has leapt again and again, the consumption of tools and fixtures has not exceeded the level of May. Many no-defect pacesetter groups have emerged in the factory, and the reject rate has been greatly reduced. For example, some groups have completed the output value target very well. Due to certain difficulties, rejects and expenses exceeded the target. After everyone in the group tried every means to carry out technological innovation and improve work efficiency, the reject and expense targets were reduced accordingly, thereby ensuring the comprehensive completion of various targets. The original target for cost reduction in the factory last year was 7%, but it actually decreased by 26.8%. This vivid example of turning a dead account into a live account has given a powerful response to those who think that "delegating power will cause chaos" and "less calculation is not much."

    While carrying out group economic accounting, our factory has always grasped the socialist labor competition movement, and according to the instructions of the higher authorities and the specific situation, formulated and implemented the "reward method for excellent groups," giving appropriate material rewards to groups that complete the three major targets of output value, quality, and expenses every month and have no major personal accidents. This embodies the spirit of adhering to putting politics in command and combining it with appropriate material encouragement, further strengthening collectivist ideology, avoiding some tendencies in piece-rate wages that hindered the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and pure economism that did not care about politics in the past.

    The combination of implementing group economic accounting, labor competition, and appropriate material rewards has formed a set of regular group management systems. Group economic accounting enriches the content of competition and vigorously promotes the in-depth development of labor competition; group competition consolidates and promotes the development of economic accounting and ensures the realization of group economic accounting targets; group rewards consolidate the achievements of group economic accounting and promote the sustained development of labor competition. This promotes each other and promotes the great development of the movement, the great revolution of technology, the great improvement of management, and the continuous Great Leap Forward in production.

    (3) After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the staff and workers warmly responded to the call for opposing right-leaning, boosting morale, and carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. They were more enthusiastic and the technological revolution and technological innovation were surging and emerging endlessly. Under this leap forward situation, some backward technical management systems have constrained the development of productive forces. Workers strongly demanded to participate in technical management, especially process management.

    Technology is the summary of labor practice. The more the masses create, the greater the changes in technology and the richer the content. In the past, some technicians mystified the technology, believing that it was an inviolable law, thereby restricting the enthusiasm and creativity of workers. Workers put forward sincere criticisms to technicians: "The process regulations compiled by your technicians are not necessary for old workers to read, and new workers can't understand them," "There are dotted lines and solid lines on the drawings, but there is no mass line." Through the anti-rightist struggle, the mass viewpoint of technicians has been strengthened. They have taken the initiative to delegate the process and asked to settle down in the groups. The factory leaders actively supported their suggestions. After the process was delegated to the groups, it was like a fish in water, and the workers' ability to be masters of their own affairs was brought into fuller play. For example, the automatic lathe group for preparing gauges not only compiled their own process cards, but also designed and manufactured their own cams, which were difficult to design and manufacture in the past. Production efficiency has increased several times compared to the past. Technicians reflected: "Going to the masses, there is a way"; the workers reflected: "Being able to combine with technicians can play a greater role."

    Technicians and workers combined to summarize the advanced experience of all model workers and creatively compiled the process in vivid and lively forms such as poems and ditties, with people, things, advanced ideas, and advanced operating experience, which was deeply welcomed by the masses. For example, the model operation method of Zeng Dehua, a grinder in the caliper workshop: "Measuring and grinding is the key, putting politics in command comes first, breaking superstitions and making revolution, concentrating thoughts and not being distracted, each plate can process one hundred pieces, it is also convenient to add up the work, the cutting is suitable and the feeding is fast, improving work efficiency by half, solving the difficult problem of bending. Everyone comes to learn from experience and create miracles to overcome the difficulties." The model worker operation method, plus simplified drawing dimensions, technical requirements, and necessary special tools and fixtures, becomes a complete set of processes, greatly simplifying process documents, enriching process content, and has a broad mass base. In this way, the continuous emergence and promotion of model worker operation methods keeps the process at the most advanced level at all times. At the same time, due to the simplification of the process and the workers themselves designing and compiling, the technicians have time to regularly participate in the discussion and approval of the new processes they compile in the groups, and jointly study and solve technical problems with the workers, summarize and promote the various advanced experiences that the groups have successfully tested, organize technical studies, and constantly improve technical level and theoretical knowledge. Therefore, the idea that delegating power will cause management chaos is not realistic.

    Practice has proven that the process of delegating technical power is the process of close integration of technicians and workers, and it is also the process of ideological transformation of technicians. The closer the technicians are to the workers, the more they realize the infinite wisdom of the workers, the more they want to be the primary school students of the workers and the masses, and the more they can realize the great correctness of the Party's mass line. After the workers participate in technical management, they also deeply feel the lack of theoretical knowledge, must combine with technicians, and actively demand to learn culture and learn theory, which also promotes the upsurge of cultural revolution.

    (4) While strengthening group management, enterprise management methods must also be changed accordingly. The process of enterprise mass production is a process of large-scale collaboration between departments, between superiors and subordinates, and between people, which are interlinked and complicated. In order to adapt to the new situation, our factory organized the departments with similar businesses and frequent contacts into seven offices in the management organization (but not counting as one level). This not only strengthened collective leadership, but also maintained the independence of the work of the departments and strengthened mutual cooperation and support. The functional staff of each business system in the factory, from the departments, workshops, to the groups, are connected up and down, left and right, in a coherent manner, acting flexibly, and carrying out dragon-like competitions in each system. In this way, professional management and mass management are truly combined.

    In terms of work methods, our factory also adopted the "one pole, one package, and one string" mass line "three one" work method. "One pole" is to quickly bring the Party's resolutions and instructions to the masses, and insert one pole into the group; "one package" is to discover the weak links and key points in production, and promptly convene the "three combination" meetings involving relevant leaders, managers, and even workers, and seek solutions in time; "one string" is to organize communist large-scale collaboration within the enterprise, mobilize the masses to compete and give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses to promptly solve the problems that arise in all aspects of production. This can ensure that the superiors fully convey the situation to the subordinates, and the subordinates fully convey the situation to the superiors, preventing the leaders from being divorced from the masses and from reality, and overcoming bureaucracy; it can also prevent and overcome the past bad phenomena of using administrative orders more, discussing less with the masses, pushing each other, unclear rights and wrongs, and often quarreling, which affected production. In this way, the communist style of large-scale collaboration of the vast number of employees can be fully developed, supporting each other, actively contacting each other, closely cooperating, and making progress together.

    III. Vigorously Engaging in Technological Innovation and Technological Revolution, Adhering to the Policy of Walking on Two Legs is the Fundamental Way to Sustained Leap Forward

    Over the past two years, we have had the following aspects in terms of the content and methods of technological revolution and technological innovation:

    (1) Under the guidance of the General Line and the idea of continuous revolution, constantly putting forward advanced indicators and advanced measures has a positive promoting effect on the development of the technological revolution movement. The factory Party committee and administrative leaders, in light of the situation at various times, promptly put forward new goals such as "reaching the designed production level within half a year" and "breaking the million (yuan) mark per day and producing two thousand five (hundred million yuan) per month." This gives the workshops, groups, and workers clear goals to strive for, and constantly maintains strong morale. According to the tasks they undertake, they formulate specific plans and measures to complete the tasks, and constantly improve the design, improve the process, and modify the equipment in their work, so that innovation suggestions emerge one after another, and production tasks rise exponentially, thereby achieving tremendous achievements in the sustained Great Leap Forward. Therefore, those who think that "the Great Leap Forward is just hard work, without clever work" are extremely wrong.

    (2) In order to realize the sustained Great Leap Forward in production and make measuring tools better meet the needs of the whole country, our factory resolutely implemented the policy of "self-reliance" and "walking on two legs," relied on the masses, vigorously engaged in technological revolution, and tried every means to overcome difficulties. Following Chairman Mao's teachings: Large enterprises can gradually be developed into comprehensive joint enterprises. According to the principle of "using foreign methods if possible, using indigenous methods if possible, generating foreign methods from indigenous methods, and combining indigenous and foreign methods," we used the enterprise profit retention to vigorously run satellite factories and engage in diversified operations.

    The shortage of steel supply has been the most prominent contradiction in our factory's production for a long time. As early as the beginning of 1957, Vice Chairman Zhu asked during his inspection of the factory: "Do you make steel?" "It would be better if you could make steel." This gave us great inspiration. Especially after the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the great call for the whole people to make steel, the whole factory quickly set off a red-hot mass steelmaking movement, from the small indigenous groups of fried steel to the construction of a steel plant with an annual output of 30,000 to 50,000 tons. With the strong support of the provincial and municipal Party committees and the support of brother factories, we built our own factory buildings and manufactured our own equipment when we couldn't buy it. We made ten-ton and twenty-ton cranes, three-ton converters, ten-ton iron melting furnaces, and 1,800 kVA electric furnace transformers. If there was no dolomite for making the furnace lining, we established a refractory materials workshop; after the three-ton electric furnace was put into production, if there were no carbon rods, we established an electrode workshop; in order to make the steel usable, we built a rolling workshop, and now it has gradually formed a small joint steel plant. In 1959 alone, we produced 7,583 tons of steel, 1,370 tons of steel, 4,904 tons of pig iron, and 692 tons of steel castings, and we also successfully trial-produced eight kinds of high-quality steel such as high-speed steel and chromium-manganese steel. For example, our factory needs a large number of abrasive tools such as grinding wheels, abrasive cloth, abrasive paper, and abrasive belts. There are many varieties, and ordering and asking for help cannot meet the needs, which seriously affects production.

    The tool warehouse managers gave full play to the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, and used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to self-make equipment such as ball mills, sand sifters, and abrasive cloth automatic lines without technical data and technical strength. They absorbed family members to run a grinding wheel factory. At present, whatever is needed in production can be manufactured, and whatever is lacking can be supplemented, and the quality reaches and exceeds national standards, and the production cost is only 50% of the national allocation price.

    After these satellite factories were put into production, they not only completed the state tasks, but also played a significant role in promoting the production of measuring tools. In the future, they will show greater power. We deeply realize that the Party's entire set of policies of walking on two legs is very correct. As long as large foreign enterprises resolutely implement the Party's line, policies, listen to the Party, emancipate their minds, dare to think and dare to act, they can do anything, and do it well. Therefore, those who think that diversified operations are "not doing the proper work, dispersing energy, and affecting the production of gauges and cutting tools," "wasting labor," "violating the national chess game," and "carrying burdens and suffering," etc., are extremely wrong. On the contrary, the result of our doing this is to do the proper work of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, promote the production of measuring tools, ensure the national chess game, and achieve a better and more comprehensive sustained Great Leap Forward.

    (3) We must continue to carry forward the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, have lofty ambitions, set great goals, climb peaks, overcome difficulties, and strive to catch up with the world's advanced scientific level as soon as possible. Without cutting-edge technology, we cannot be considered to have truly established a modern industry. Our factory has successively adopted more than ten kinds of new processes and new technologies with the world's advanced level. For example, the new process of twisting and making the head, which has already been put into production, has improved work efficiency seven times. A set of rolling and twisting equipment can replace fourteen milling machines and save about 50% of high-speed steel; the new process of rubbing and making the head is being adjusted for production. One rubbing machine can replace forty milling machines; the tap automatic line has been basically completed, and eighteen kinds of precision and cutting-edge products have been successfully trial-produced. At the same time, our factory has also established a research institute and carried out experimental research work among the masses, so that professional experimental research work and mass experimental research work are well combined.

    (4) The technological revolution must be combined with the cultural revolution. Our factory has opened amateur schools such as primary schools, middle schools, and specialized universities, and also held various short-term intensive training courses for technology, culture, and other courses, and also carried out the work of literacy. After learning, the technical and cultural level of the staff and workers has been greatly improved, which has strongly promoted the development of the technological revolution.

    IV. Vigorously Engaging in Communist Large-Scale Collaboration is a Positive Factor in Developing Production

    Communist large-scale collaboration is determined by the nature of the socialist system. It is an important link to ensure the completion and over-completion of the national economic plan and the high-speed construction of socialism. The socialist public ownership of the means of production determines the cooperative relationship between our various units and brother factories. Vigorously engaging in communist collaboration can constantly change the relations of production, mobilize all positive factors, and promote the leap forward development of production. Therefore, the process of socialist enterprise production must be a process of large-scale collaboration. Any departure from the collective and from the mutual collaboration of socialism will achieve nothing or achieve very little.

    Facts have proven that the achievements our factory has made since its establishment are the crystallization of communist large-scale collaboration. In the past few years, many weak links and difficulties have often emerged in our factory in terms of infrastructure construction, production, technology, and especially raw material supply. Although we have actively taken some measures and tried every means to rely on our own efforts, there are still many problems that cannot be completely solved. It is because of the strong support of many brother units that we have guaranteed the early completion of our factory and the sustained Great Leap Forward in production. Obviously, the fact that "everything does not require others" is absolutely non-existent.

    The attitude of collaboration is a question of worldview, a question of the communist and collectivist ideology of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me." Therefore, the factory Party committee often educates all staff and workers: We must recognize that helping others is helping ourselves; we must give convenience to others and keep difficulties for ourselves, and constantly criticize those who think that "their own tasks are very tight, so they have no strength to help others," who only care about themselves, do not care about others, only care about the local, do not care about the overall, only calculate the local small accounts, and do not calculate the national big accounts, and the bourgeois business style of "you come and I go, half a catty is half a catty." And made a decision: We must complete the tasks of our factory and our workshop, and we must also complete the tasks of foreign factories and foreign workshops; under certain difficult circumstances, even if we cannot complete the tasks of our factory and our workshop, we must resolutely complete the tasks of foreign factories and foreign workshops; if it is really impossible, we must also help them to ask other brother units to solve it, or explain it clearly to the other party. At the same time, the collaboration task and the production plan are issued together and treated equally. We have also established a special organization to lead the collaboration work, and regularly conduct inspections, and solve problems in a timely manner. Over the past two years, communist large-scale collaboration has been universally valued among the staff and workers of our factory, which has played an extremely important role in promoting the sustained leap forward in production.

    Although our factory has made some achievements, there are still many shortcomings in our work. In the future, we must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and humbly learn from brother units. We will launch a study movement of Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, continue to adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously launch mass movements, vigorously engage in technological revolution, strengthen communist large-scale collaboration, and achieve a better and more comprehensive sustained Great Leap Forward in 1960 with one heart, one mind, and one style.

    企业管理怎样适应生产高速度发展的要求
    田景琦代表的发言
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念副总理向大会所作的报告，回厂后一定坚决贯彻执行。现将我厂生产大跃进的情况，向大会汇报如下：
    一、相信党、依靠党是胜利的保证
    毛主席教导我们：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那么什么事也做不成了”。要办好社会主义企业，就决不能离开这两条原理。两年以来，我们深深地体会到，越是遇到困难越要听党的话，坚决贯彻执行党的指示，充分发动群众，克服一切困难，才能保证生产的持续发展。
    我厂从筹建开始就坚持了党的勤俭办企业的方针，采取了先生产，后福利；边建设，边生产的措施。因而，节约了资金，赢得了时间，加快了建厂进度，从筹建到建成仅用了一年零十个月的时间，提前在1958年1月全面投入生产。在整风反右斗争胜利的基础上，进一步地贯彻了党的总路线，实现了持续大跃进，仅半年时间就达到了设计能力，在1959年9月就提前完成了国家交给我厂的第二个五年计划的各项生产指标，目前生产已超过设计能力的四倍以上。两年完成的上缴利润可再建两个与我厂同样的工厂。我们坚决贯彻了党的两条腿走路的方针，自力更生，用土洋结合的办法，新建了复杂刃具、钻头新工艺等厂房；并根据生产迫切需要，不受专业限制，挖掘潜力，新建了钢铁分厂（包括炼钢、炼铁、轧钢、耐火材料、电极、水泥等车间）和化工、砂轮、烧砖、制材等十余个卫星厂，这对解决材料困难，保证生产持续跃进，起了重大作用。此外，还帮建和包建了十多个中小型工厂。在支援农业“四化”方面，我厂积极发动群众，采取了厂部对公社、车间对管区、工段对生产队对口包干负责的办法，帮助成都郊区青龙公社建立了机械、化肥等十一个厂、站，将十四个百头以上的养猪场实现了半机械化，还帮助公社修理、改良了大批农具和运输工具。
    这些成就的取得，主要归功于党中央和毛主席的正确领导，是坚持政治挂帅，开展了两条道路的斗争，不断地批判了那些认为下放权力要“造成混乱”，多种经营是“不务正业，分散精力，影响量具刃具生产”，帮助新厂是“多管闲事”，大跃进是“数量跃进，技术没有跃进”等等右倾错误思想的结果。是党的总路线的胜利，大跃进的胜利，大搞群众运动的胜利。
    二、相信群众、依靠群众是力量的源泉
    群众路线是党的根本路线。在社会主义制度下，工人阶级是企业的主人。因此，要想办好社会主义企业，必须坚决依靠工人参加企业管理。工人参加管理的形式很多，而参加小组管理，则是最有效最基本的形式。我厂两年来大搞群众运动的实践证明：小组管理是企业管理的基础。生产小组既是轰轰烈烈大搞群众运动的起点，又是扎扎实实作好各项工作的落脚点。而加强小组管理的关键，则在于是否敢把小组应该管理的权力下放到小组。这是衡量一个企业领导是否相信群众的主要标志之一，也是我厂两年来在企业管理上，是只依靠少数“内行”还是依靠群众大搞群众运动的两条路线斗争的焦点。
    我厂加强小组管理，下放权力的过程，是不断贯彻“两参一改三结合”和分级分权管理的过程。开始由工人参加日常生产管理，发展到大搞小组经济核算，参加经济管理，进而发展到参加技术管理，小组编制工艺和进行设计、质量检查，直至参加全面的企业管理。这样，小组管理的内容就更加丰富，显示了强大的生命力，专业管理也有了广泛的群众基础，把专业管理和群众管理结合起来，进一步贯彻了党的集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，不断地调整了生产关系与生产力、上层建筑与经济基础的矛盾，促进了生产持续跃进。
      （一）经过伟大的整风运动和反右派斗争，职工主人翁责任感大大加强，强烈的要求参加企业管理和改革不合理的规章制度。双反运动中，群众贴出十多万张大字报，其中80％左右是针对管理工作的，一张大字报上写道：“清早来上班，任务一大摊，借工具、借图纸，跑来跑去费时间。这里争，那里吵，动嘴多，动手少，事事都要干部搞，主人翁那能当得好。”厂党委和行政领导坚决支持了群众的要求，大破陈规，下放权力，改革体制，建立了小组管理组织和制度，贯彻了“两参一改三结合”的方针。从而，管理工作大大加强，全厂面貌焕然一新，实现了许多重大技术革新，攻克了无数生产关键，计划超额再超额，质量提高又提高，成本逐月下降，促进了生产大跃进。工人写诗赞扬道：“今天喜见天门开（指权力下放），生产我们自安排。工具图纸早准备，英雄有武用出来。不用三年和五载，英美老牌往后排。”从此，党的群众路线在我厂干部中生根发芽，生产小组也逐步成长起来。
      （二）实践证明，领导越是相信群众，把权力下放到小组，群众的干劲就越大，就越能发挥出无穷无尽的智慧和力量。1959年初群众迫切要求继续下放权力，参加经济管理，提出了“当家不理财，那能当好家”的要求。厂党委和行政领导坚持了党的集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，坚决执行了省、市委关于分级分权管理制度的指示，支持了群众的要求，又将财权下放到小组。去年5月在全厂范围内，以小组核算为基础的经济核算的群众运动，迅速而猛烈开展起来，一反过去少数人搞成本，搞核算的冷冷清清的局面，出现了人人核算，个个理财的新局面，把增产节约运动推向了新的高峰，整个企业管理工作进入了一个新阶段。小组核算制的开展，还大大促进了技术革命的开展，而技术革命的开展，又推动了经济核算，如：许多小组千方百计地节约工具，仅去年5月份一个月内，工卡具消耗就下降30％，几个月来，生产虽一跃再跃，但工卡具消耗却一直没有超过5月份的水平。全厂出现了不少的无废品标兵小组，废品率大大降低。再如有的小组，产值指标完成很好，由于某种困难，废品和费用超过指标，经过小组人人千方百计，大搞技术革新，提高了工效，使废品和费用指标得以相应降低，从而保证了各项指标的全面完成。去年全厂成本降低指标原订为7％，实际却降低了26.8％。这一死账算成活账的生动事例对那些认为“下放权力造成混乱”，“少了算不多”的错误论调给了有力的回击。
    我厂在进行小组经济核算的同时，自始至终都抓紧了社会主义的劳动竞赛运动，并根据上级指示和具体情况，制订和实行了“优胜小组奖励办法”，对每月完成产值、质量与费用三大指标和并无重大人身事故的小组，给予适当的物质奖励。这就体现了坚持政治挂帅与适当物质鼓励相结合的精神，进一步加强了集体主义思想，避免了过去在计件工资上所产生的某些妨碍群众积极性与创造性的发挥和单纯经济主义，不过问政治的倾向。
    实行小组经济核算和劳动竞赛与适当的物质奖励三者相结合，形成了一套经常性的小组管理制度。小组经济核算丰富了竞赛内容，有力地推动了劳动竞赛的深入开展；小组竞赛又巩固与促进了经济核算的发展，并保证了小组经济核算指标的实现；小组奖励既巩固了小组经济核算的成果，又推动了劳动竞赛的持久开展。这样相互促进，相互推动，促使了运动大开展，技术大革命，管理大提高，生产持续大跃进。
      （三）党的八届八中全会后，职工热烈地响应了反右倾、鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动的号召，干劲更加十足，技术革命与技术革新风起云涌，层出不穷。在此跃进形势下，一些落后的技术管理制度已束缚了生产力的发展。工人强烈要求参加技术管理，特别是工艺管理。
    工艺是劳动实践的总结。群众的创造愈多，工艺的变化也就愈大，内容也就愈丰富。过去由于一些技术人员把工艺神秘化，认为它是不可侵犯的法规，因而束缚了工人的积极性和创造性，工人向技术人员提出了诚恳的批评：“你们技术人员编制的工艺规程是老工人不需要看，新工人看不懂”，“图纸上有虚线、有实线，就是没有群众路线”。通过反右倾斗争，技术人员的群众观点加强了，主动要求下放工艺，要求到小组安家落户，厂领导上积极支持了他们的建议。工艺下放小组后，如鱼得水，更加发挥了工人当家作主的才能。如量具备料自动车床组，不但自己编制工艺卡片，并把过去难于设计和制作的凸轮，自己设计，自己制造，生产效率比过去提高几倍。技术人员反映：“到群众中去有了办法”；工人反映：“能和技术人员结合，就能发挥更大的作用了”。
    技术人员与工人结合，总结了所有标兵的先进经验，并创造性地以诗歌、顺口溜等生动活泼的形式编成工艺，有人、有物、有先进思想、有先进操作经验，深受到群众欢迎。如卡尺车间磨工曾德华标兵操作法：“测尺磨削是关键，政治挂帅首当先，破除迷信搞革命，思想集中不分散，每盘卡活一百件，加起工来也方便，吃刀合适送刀快，提高工效一倍半，解决弯曲破难关。大家都来学经验，再创奇迹攻尖端”。标兵操作法，再加上简图尺寸、技术要求和必要的专用工卡具，就成了一套完整的工艺，大大简化了工艺文件，丰富了工艺内容，并具有广泛的群众基础。这样，标兵操作法的不断出现与推广，使工艺始终保持了最先进的水平。同时，由于工艺的简化和工人自己进行设计、编制，就使技术人员有了时间，经常到小组参加讨论与审批他们所编制的新工艺，和工人共同研究解决技术问题，总结、推广小组已经试验成功的各种先进经验，组织技术学习，不断地提高技术水平和理论知识。因此，那种认为下放权力就会造成管理混乱的想法是不切合实际的。
    实践证明：技术权力下放的过程，是技术人员与工人紧密结合的过程，也是对技术人员进行思想改造的过程，技术人员越与工人接近，就越体会到工人的无穷智慧，越要当工人群众的小学生，也越能体会到党的群众路线的伟大正确。而工人参加技术管理后，也深感理论知识的不足，必须与技术人员结合，积极要求学习文化，学习理论，从而也促进了文化革命的高涨。
      （四）在加强小组管理的同时，企业管理方法也必须作相应改变。企业大生产的过程是各部门之间、上下之间、人与人之间，环环相联，错综复杂的大协作过程。为了适应新的情况，我厂在管理机构上，把业务相近、联系频繁的科室组织了七个办公室（但不算一级）。这样既加强了集体领导，又保持了科室工作的独立性，加强了相互协作支持。使全厂各业务系统由科室、车间、直到小组职能员，上下左右，条条块块，贯通一气，行动灵活，并开展了各系统的一条龙竞赛。这样就使专业管理与群众管理真正地结合起来。
    在工作方法上，我厂还采用了“一竿子、一揽子、一串子”群众路线的“三一”工作方法。“一竿子”是把党的决议、指示迅速和群众见面，一竿子插到小组；“一揽子”是发现生产上的薄弱环节与关键，及时地召开有关领导、管理人员，一直到工人参加的“三结合”会议，及时求得解决；“一串子”是组织企业内部共产主义大协作，把生产上各方面出现的问题，发动群众打擂比武，充分发挥群众的积极性和主动性及时加以解决。这样既可作到上情充分下达，下情充分上达，防止领导脱离群众，脱离实际，克服官僚主义；又可以防止和克服过去多用行政命令，少和群众商量，彼此推拖，是非不清，经常扯皮，影响生产的不良现象。这样就能充分发扬广大职工群众的共产主义大协作的风格，互相支持，主动联系，密切配合，共同跃进。
    三、大闹技术革新和技术革命，坚持两条腿走路的方针是持续跃进的根本途径
    两年来，我们在技术革命和技术革新的内容和作法上，有以下几个方面：
      （一）在总路线和不断革命论的思想指导下，不断提出先进指标和先进措施，这对技术革命运动的开展有着积极推动的作用。厂党委和行政领导上针对各个时期的情况，及时地提出了“半年内达到设计生产水平”，“日破百万（元）关，月产两千五（百万元）”等等新的奋斗目标。使各车间、小组、工人有了明确的奋斗目标，经常保持旺盛的士气，按照自己担负的任务，制定完成任务的具体规划和措施，并在工作中不断改进设计、改进工艺、改装设备，使革新建议层出不穷，生产任务成倍上升，从而取得了持续大跃进的巨大成就。因此，那些认为“大跃进只是苦战，没有巧战”的论调是极端错误的。
      （二）为了实现生产持续大跃进，使量具刃具更好的满足全国需要。我厂坚决贯彻了“自力更生”、“两条腿走路”的方针，依靠群众，大闹技术革命，千方百计，战胜困难。遵循毛主席教导：大型企业，可以逐步地办成为综合性的联合企业。按照“能洋则洋，能土则土，土中生洋，土洋结合”的原则，利用企业利润留成，大办卫星工厂，进行多种经营。
    钢材供应不足是我厂生产上长期以来最突出的矛盾。早在1957年初朱副主席来厂视察时曾问过：“你们炼钢没有？”“能炼钢就更好”。这给了我们很大的启示。特别是在党中央和毛主席提出全民大炼钢铁的伟大号召后，全厂迅速掀起了热火朝天的大炼钢铁运动，从小土群的炒钢，直至新建了年产三万至五万吨的钢厂。在省市委的大力支持和各兄弟厂的支援下，我们自己修建厂房，买不到设备就自己制造，制出了十吨、二十吨的吊车，三吨转炉，十吨化铁炉，以及一千八百千伏安电炉变压器等设备。没有打炉衬的白云石，就建立了耐火材料车间；三吨电炉投入生产后，没有炭精棒，就成立了电极车间；为使钢能成材，又建了轧钢车间，现已逐渐形成了一个小型的联合钢铁厂。仅1959年就生产了钢七千五百八十三吨，钢材一千三百七十吨，生铁四千九百零四吨，浇钢件六百九十二吨，而且还试炼成功了高速钢、铬锰钢等八种优质钢。又如我厂生产上需用大量的砂轮、砂布、砂纸、砂带等磨料工具，品种繁多，订货求援均不能满足需要，严重影响生产。
  工具库管理人员发挥了敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，在无技术资料和技术力量的情况下，用土洋结合的办法自制了球磨机、筛砂机和砂布自动线等设备，吸收家属办起了砂轮厂。目前，生产上需要什么，就能制造什么，缺什么，就补充什么，而且质量达到和超过国家标准，生产成本仅为国家调拨价格的50％。
    这些卫星工厂投入生产后，不仅完成了国家任务，而且对促进量具刃具生产起了重大作用，今后还将显示出更大的威力。我们深深体会到党的一整套两条腿走路方针是十分正确的。大洋企业只要坚决贯彻党的路线、方针政策，听党的话，解放思想、敢想敢干，什么事情都能干，而且干得好。因此，那些认为多种经营是“不务正业，分散精力，影响量具刃具生产”，“浪费劳动力”，“违反全国一盘棋”、“背包袱吃苦头”等等说法，都是极其错误的。恰恰相反，我们这样作的结果，正是务了总路线、大跃进的正业，促进了量具刃具生产，保证了全国一盘棋，实现了更好更全面的持续大跃进。
      （三）必须继续发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，树雄心、立大志、攀高峰、攻尖端，力争及早赶上世界先进科学水平。没有尖端，就不能算真正建立起现代化的工业。我厂先后采用了十余种具有世界先进水平的新工艺、新技术。如早已投入生产的扭制占头新工艺提高了工效七倍，一套轧扭设备即可代替十四台铣床，节约高速钢50％左右；搓制占头新工艺，正在调整生产中，一台搓占机可代替四十台铣床；丝锥自动线已基本落成，并试制成功了精密和尖端产品十八种。与此同时，我厂还成立了研究所，并在群众中开展了试验研究工作，使专业性的试验研究工作和群众性的试验研究工作很好地结合起来。
      （四）技术革命必须与文化革命相结合。我厂开办了小学、中学、专科大学等业余学校，同时举办了各种短期的速成的技术、文化等各种训练班，还进行了扫盲的工作。经过学习，大大提高了职工的技术、文化水平，有力地促进了技术革命的开展。
    四、大搞共产主义大协作是发展生产的积极因素
    共产主义大协作是社会主义制度性质所决定的，它是保证完成和超额完成国民经济计划，高速度地建设社会主义的一个重要环节。社会主义生产资料的公有制决定了我们各个单位之间兄弟厂的协作关系，大搞共产主义协作，就能不断地改变生产关系，就能调动一切积极因素，促进生产飞跃地向前发展。因此，社会主义企业生产的过程必然是大协作的过程，任何离开集体，离开社会主义的相互协作，都将是一事无成，或者成绩很小。
    事实证明，我厂从建厂以来所取得的成就，就是共产主义大协作的结晶。几年来，我厂在基建、生产、技术上，特别是在原材料供应上，经常不断地出现许多薄弱环节和困难，虽然积极采取了一些措施，千方百计、自力更生，然而仍有许多问题不能全部解决。由于许许多多兄弟单位的大力支持，才保证了我厂提前建成和实现了生产上的持续大跃进。显然，“万事不求人”的事实是绝对不存在的。
    协作的态度是一个世界观的问题，是一个“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义、集体主义思想问题。因此，厂党委经常教育全体职工：必须认识到帮助别人就是帮助自己；要把方便让给别人，困难留给自己，经常不断批判那些认为“自己任务都很紧，那有力量帮别人”的只顾自己，不管别人，只顾局部，不顾整体，只算局部小账，不算国家大账等本位主义思想，以及资产阶级的“你来我去，半斤八两”的商人作风。并作出决定：既要完成本厂、本车间的任务，又要完成外厂、外车间的任务；在某种困难情况下，即使完不成本厂、本车间的任务，也要坚决完成外厂、外车间的任务；如果实在办不到，也要帮助他们再请其他兄弟单位解决，或向对方解释清楚。同时将协作任务和生产计划一起下达，同等看待。我们还建立了专门领导协作工作的机构，经常进行检查，发现问题及时解决。两年来，在我厂职工群众中，对共产主义大协作，普遍地重视起来，这对促进生产持续跃进，起了极其重大的作用。
    我厂虽然取得了一些成绩，但是在我们工作中还存在着很多缺点，今后一定戒骄戒躁，虚心向兄弟单位学习。开展马列主义和毛主席著作的学习运动，继续坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命，加强共产主义大协作，一条心，一股劲，一个样的实现1960年更好、更全面的持续大跃进。
