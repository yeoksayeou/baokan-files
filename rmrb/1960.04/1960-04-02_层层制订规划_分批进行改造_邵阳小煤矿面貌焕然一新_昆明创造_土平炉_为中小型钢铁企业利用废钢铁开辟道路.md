Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, April 1st: Small coal mines in the Shao Yang Special District, Hunan, have seen a new atmosphere of both saving manpower and increasing production during their technical transformation. In January and February of this year, the number of employees in the district's small coal mines was more than halved compared to the same period last year, while the daily coal output increased by more than 19% compared to the same period last year. The consumption of pit props and the cost of coal have significantly decreased, and safety in production has also greatly improved compared to the past.

The technical transformation of small coal mines in the Shao Yang area began as early as the second quarter of last year, and more than one hundred pairs of mines have been transformed so far. Among them, thirty-eight pairs of mines have already used power machinery for drainage, hoisting, or ventilation, and the remaining mines are also widely using simple machinery such as indigenous winches, indigenous water pumps, and indigenous blowers to replace manual operations. Therefore, a large amount of labor has been saved, fundamentally changing the situation of small coal kilns stopping production in winter and resuming in spring (due to the need for labor for spring plowing). The annual production capacity of the one hundred pairs of mines that were transformed last year has also increased from 600,000 tons before the transformation to 2.2 million tons.

In the technical transformation of small coal mines, special organizational structures were established at the levels of the Shao Yang Special District, counties (cities), and coal mines to strengthen leadership, conduct typical investigations, comprehensively analyze and study, formulate technical transformation plans layer by layer, and carry out transformation in batches. In the transformation, it was closely integrated with production, launching a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, giving full play to the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses. Currently, twenty coal mines in the district have promoted the regular wall-style coal mining method. Many coal mines have also implemented the four-eight cross-operation labor combination system. In terms of roadway development, many mines have adopted the method of using wells to improve wells (using existing well caves as ventilation shafts, only opening one production shaft), and using roadways to improve roadways (straightening and leveling the curved and uneven roadways), which greatly accelerated the progress of coal mine transformation and saved funds and labor.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 1st: The Kunming No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant has created a "indigenous open-hearth furnace" for melting scrap steel and iron, solving the problem of recycling scrap steel and iron in the absence of steelmaking open-hearth furnaces. This creation has opened up a broad path for small and medium-sized steelmaking enterprises that do not have steelmaking open-hearth furnaces to use the large amount of accumulated scrap steel for production.

At present, iron and steel enterprises and machinery factories in Yunnan Province have accumulated at least 100,000 tons or more of scrap steel and iron. These enterprises all use converters and electric furnaces for steelmaking, so a large amount of scrap steel cannot be utilized. The "indigenous open-hearth furnace" created by the Kunming No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant has well solved this major problem. The Yunnan Provincial Economic Commission and the Metallurgical Department recently held an on-site meeting at this plant and decided to universally promote this advanced experience in enterprises throughout the province that have steelmaking equipment. In this way, the province can increase the production of pig iron by about 100,000 tons or steel by about 70,000 tons in a short period of time without increasing equipment or manpower. Therefore, this creation will play a significant role in ensuring that the province completes its leap forward plan for steel production this year.

The structure of this "indigenous open-hearth furnace" is very simple, and the construction is also convenient. Just dig a pit near the hillside, line it with foamed sandstone, and install a motor to drive a Ye-style blower. This "indigenous open-hearth furnace" can be built in one day and one night. Because of its large volume, large pieces of scrap steel and iron can also be melted. When melting, put the scrap steel and iron into the furnace, add one-third of coke and 2% limestone. During the melting process, the carbon content of the scrap steel increases from the original 0.25% to 2.5% due to the absorption of carbon from the coke, and finally becomes gray cast iron that meets the needs of steelmaking. A furnace with a volume of eleven cubic meters can produce about 50 tons of iron a day. As of March 25th, this factory has used "indigenous open-hearth furnaces" to produce 626 tons of pig iron. The average cost per ton of pig iron is less than thirty yuan. Operating this "indigenous open-hearth furnace" is also easy. A worker with a little knowledge of blast furnace blowing, coupled with ordinary workers, can carry out production.

    层层制订规划  分批进行改造
    邵阳小煤矿面貌焕然一新
    昆明创造“土平炉”为中小型钢铁企业利用废钢铁开辟道路
    据新华社长沙1日电　湖南邵阳专区小煤矿在技术改造中出现了既节约人力又增加生产的新气象。今年1、2月份，全区小煤矿的职工人数比去年同期节约了一半多，而煤的日产量却比去年同期增长了19％以上。坑木的消耗数量和煤的成本有显著降低，安全生产工作也比过去有很大改进。
    邵阳地区小煤矿技术改造早在去年第二季度就开始了，到目前已经改造了一百多对矿井。其中，有三十八对矿井的排水、提升或通风工作已经用上了动力机械，其余的矿井也正在普遍地采用土绞车、土水泵、土风鼓等简易机械来代替人力操作。因此，劳动力大量节约下来，根本改变了小煤窑冬季生产、春季停产（因春耕需要劳动力）的局面。去年经过改造的一百对矿井的年产能力，也由改造前的六十万吨提高到了二百二十万吨。
    在小煤矿技术改造的工作中，邵阳专区、县（市）和煤矿层层成立了专门的组织机构，加强领导，进行典型调查，全面分析研究，层层制订技术改造规划，分批进行改造。改造中，同生产紧密结合，大搞技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，充分发挥了群众的干劲和智慧。现在全区已经有二十个煤矿推广了正规的壁式采煤方法。许多煤矿还推行四八交叉作业的劳动组合制度。在巷道开拓方面，很多矿采取了以井改井（利用原有的井洞作通风井，只开一个生产井），就巷改巷（把弯曲不平的巷道改直改平）的办法，大大加快了煤井改造进度，节约了资金和劳动力。
    据新华社昆明1日电　昆明第一钢铁厂创造出一种熔炼废钢废铁的“土平炉”，解决了在没有炼钢平炉的条件下回收废钢铁的问题。这一创造，给当前没有炼钢平炉的中小型炼钢企业利用大量积存的废钢铁进行生产，开辟了广阔的道路。
    云南省各钢铁企业和机械厂，目前积存了至少有十万吨以上的废钢铁。这些企业都是用转炉和电炉炼钢，因此大量废钢铁不能利用。昆明第一钢铁厂创造的“土平炉”，很好地解决了这一重大问题。云南省经济委员会和冶金厅，最近在这个厂召开了现场会议，决定在全省有炼钢设备的企业普遍推广这一先进经验。这样，全省在不增设备和人力的条件下，短期内即可增产十万吨左右的生铁或七万吨左右的钢。因此，这一创造对保证全省完成今年钢铁生产跃进计划，将起很大作用。
    这种“土平炉”构造很简单，建筑也方便。只要在山坡附近挖一个坑，内砌泡砂石，安装上马达，带动叶氏鼓风机即成。这种“土平炉”一天一夜就可建好一座。由于它的容积大，所以大块的废钢废铁也能熔炼。熔炼时把废钢废铁投入炉内，加三分之一的焦炭和2％的石灰石。废钢在熔炼过程中由于吸收了焦炭的碳分，含碳量由原来的0.25％增加到2.5％，最后变成了合乎炼钢需要的灰口铁。一个容积十一立方米的炉子，一天能产铁五十吨左右。到3月25日止，这个厂已用“土平炉”炼出了六百二十六吨生铁。平均每吨生铁成本不到三十元。操作这种“土平炉”也容易，一个稍具高炉吹炼知识的工人，配上普通工人，就可以进行生产。
