To strengthen political and ideological education for commune members, Yongji County has established a propaganda network, a newspaper reading network, a cultural education network, and a science and technology research network.

(Dispatch from this newspaper) The Yongji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jilin Province has established a propaganda network, a newspaper reading network, a cultural education network, and a science and technology research network throughout the county to strengthen political and ideological education for commune members and to popularize science and technology and cultural knowledge in order to meet the needs of agricultural technological transformation.

The Yongji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party formulated a technological transformation plan for agricultural modernization in the county last October. According to this plan, the county will basically achieve agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification within a few years. In order to adapt to this new situation, the County Committee decided to establish propaganda, newspaper reading, cultural education, and science and technology research networks in rural areas. According to this decision, party organizations at all levels have developed more than 10,000 propagandists, more than 4,000 newspaper readers, more than 2,000 amateur cultural teachers, and more than 10,000 science and technology researchers throughout the county from last November to the present. Then, with the management district as the unit, more than 360 propaganda and newspaper reading, amateur cultural education, and science and technology research networks were established throughout the county. These "four networks" take the propaganda network as the center and drive the other three networks to carry out extensive activities.

After the establishment of the cultural education network and the science and technology research network, amateur cultural schools were established in every production team in the county's communes, transforming the past scattered and infrequent learning of commune members into organized and regular learning, and initially forming a farmers' amateur education system from primary to more advanced levels. At present, 45,000 people have enrolled in schools throughout the county, accounting for 92% of illiterate and semi-literate commune members. With more than 10,000 science and technology researchers as the backbone, more than 1,300 science and technology research groups have been built, and dedicated personnel have been assigned to study everything from production tools to logistical tools, from agricultural technology innovation to the reform of the cultivation system. In the past two months, more than 1,500 pieces of tools for land preparation, sowing, and other purposes have been created and modified throughout the county, greatly strengthening the preparations for spring plowing. Eighty percent of the commune members in the county have participated in agricultural high-yield experience summarizing and technological research activities.

The Yongji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and party organizations at all levels attach great importance to the leadership of the "four networks," and secretaries at all levels take command. In terms of leadership methods, the "three guarantees and three unifieds" are implemented, that is, the commune party committee secretary guarantees the area, the branch secretary guarantees the management area, the branch committee member guarantees the network, and unified leadership, unified arrangement, and unified inspection. In order to continuously strengthen these new organizations and further give play to their role, many commune party committees have established "four networks" experimental fields. After the "four networks" were just established, the secretary of the Jiangmifeng Commune Party Committee established experimental fields, explored the methods of mutual cooperation between the "four members" (propagandists, newspaper readers, amateur cultural teachers, and science and technology researchers), and held on-site meetings to train the "four members." Because party committees at all levels have strengthened the leadership of the "four networks," the activities of the "four networks" throughout the county have quickly become regularized, and systems such as meeting system, experience exchange, task arrangement, and evaluation and reward have been basically established.

    加强对社员的政治思想教育
    永吉县建立宣传网读报网文化教育网和科学技术研究网
    本报讯　中共吉林省永吉县委在全县范围内建立了宣传网、读报网、文化教育网和科学技术研究网，以加强对社员的政治思想教育和普及科学技术、文化知识，适应农业技术改造的需要。
    中共永吉县委在去年10月制定了全县农业现代化的技术改造规划。按照这个规划，全县将在几年内基本上实现农业机械化、水利化和电气化。为了适应这一新形势，县委决定在农村中建立宣传网、读报网、文化教育网和科学技术研究网。各级党组织根据这一决定，从去年11月到现在，陆续在全县范围内发展了宣传员一万多名，读报员四千多名，业余文化教员二千多名，科学技术研究员一万多名；接着以管理区为单位，建立起遍布全县的三百六十多个宣传读报、业余文化教育和科学技术研究网。这“四网”以宣传网为中心，带动其它三网广泛展开活动。
    文化教育网和科学技术研究网建立以后，全县各公社内队队建立起业余文化学校，使社员们过去分散的不经常的学习变成了有组织的经常性的学习，并且初步形成了一个由初级到较高级的农民业余教育体系。目前，全县已有四万五千人入学，占文盲半文盲社员的92％。全县以一万多名科学技术研究员为骨干，建成了一千三百多个科学技术研究小组后，从生产工具到后勤工具、从农业技术革新到耕作制度的改革，都有专人研究。近两个月来，全县已创造和改制了整地、播种等工具一千五百多件，大大加强了春耕准备工作。全县有80％的社员参加了农业丰产经验总结和技术研究活动。
    中共永吉县委和各级党组织非常重视对“四网”的领导，层层都有书记挂帅。在领导方法上实行了“三包三统一”，即公社党委书记包片、支部书记包管理区、支部委员包网和统一领导、统一安排、统一检查。为了使这些新的组织不断壮大和进一步发挥作用，许多公社党委都搞了“四网”试验田。江密峰公社党委书记在“四网”刚建成以后，就搞试验田，摸出了“四员”（宣传员、读报员、业余文化教员、科学技术研究员）互相配合的活动方法，并召开现场会议对“四员”进行培养训练。由于各级党委加强对“四网”的领导，使全县“四网”的活动很快走向经常，基本上建立起会议制度、交流经验、布置任务和评比奖励等制度。                          （郝玉田）
