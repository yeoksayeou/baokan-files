    Scientific Management Seeks Perfection, Surpassing Production Quotas in a Booming Movement
    Anguo Strives to Cross the Yellow River in One Summer Harvest

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Anguo County, Hebei, which had already exceeded the national agricultural development program’s grain output targets ahead of schedule last year, is now focusing on wheat management this year, striving to cross the Yellow River in one summer harvest.

    All of Anguo County’s 300,000 mu of wheat fields were deep-plowed to a depth of eight inches or more before sowing, with a general application of 8,000 to 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and 15,000 jin per mu for high-yield fields. Moreover, sowing was timely, the amount of seeds used was appropriate, the density was reasonable, and the varieties were excellent, achieving varietal optimization. All wheat fields have achieved water conservancy and irrigation mechanization, with more than 70% achieving high-standard garden-like management. After sowing, management was also more timely than in previous years, with universal watering before freezing and harrowing last winter. At the wheat greening stage, topdressing, watering, cultivation, and disease and pest control were carried out universally. Special management methods such as preferential fertilizer and water were adopted for the third-category fields with less than 400,000 tillers per mu to promote upgrading. Therefore, the wheat growth in the county is very good. Currently, first and second-category wheat fields account for more than 93% of the total wheat field area.

    Scientific management and the pursuit of perfection, gradually raising wheat field management to a new technical level, is a feature of Anguo County’s wheat field management this year. Mass scientific and technological research organizations have been established in all communes and production teams throughout the county, mobilizing everyone to learn science and master technology. Scientific research stations, comprehensive testing laboratories, and soil testing, meteorological, technological research, seed, invention, and creation groups have also been established in the wheat high-yield demonstration plots. These technical organizations, based on the various key stages of wheat growth, conduct investigations and research, and adopt scientific management measures suited to local conditions and seedlings, making wheat field management more and more detailed.

    Carrying out a large-scale high-yield movement, with high-yield demonstration plots as the backbone and the elimination of low-yield fields as the focus, is an important measure for the county to win a comprehensive bumper harvest this summer. There are a total of 88 large-scale high-yield wheat demonstration plots in the county, covering more than 210,000 mu, accounting for more than 70% of the total wheat field area. In order to carry out high-yield experiments in a planned way and accumulate high-yield experience, and to continuously enrich and improve the technical level of wheat high-yield, communes and production teams have also cultivated more than 150,000 mu of high-yield fields, command fields, experimental comparison fields, and seed fields within the high-yield demonstration plots, including more than 50,000 mu of high-yield "King Fields" cultivated by county party committee, commune party committee, and production team leaders alone. These high-yield fields are used as the backbone to command and drive general fields. In the spirit of attaching equal importance to large-scale high yield and comprehensive harvest, all localities have strengthened the management of third-category wheat fields while vigorously developing high-yield demonstration plots. After this period of careful management, 70% of the third-category seedlings have been upgraded.

    In order to promote the in-depth development of wheat field management and achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest in summer, all communes and production teams have widely launched the mass surpassing-production competition movement of "Six Catch-Ups" (third-category seedlings catch up with second-category seedlings, second-category seedlings catch up with first-category seedlings, first-category seedlings catch up with "King Fields", weak plants catch up with strong plants, low-yield catch up with high-yield, and every plot catches up with "the first field"), "Three Surpassings" (actual output surpasses contracted output, measures surpass targets, and efforts surpass measures), striving to surpass the contracted output by another 20% to 30%.

    科学管理精益求精　超产运动轰轰烈烈
    安国力争夏收一季过黄河
    据新华社讯  去年已经提前超额实现全国农业发展纲要规定粮食产量指标的河北安国县，今年狠抓小麦管理，力争夏收一季过黄河。
    安国县三十万亩麦田播种前全部深翻八寸以上，一般亩施底肥八千到一万斤，丰产田亩施一万五千斤；而且播种适时，下种量适宜，密度合理，品种优良，实现了优种化；全部麦田实现了水利化和灌溉机械化，其中有70％以上实现了高标准园田化。播种后，管理也比往年及时，去冬普遍浇了上冻水和进行了轧耙。在小麦返青时，又普遍进行了追肥、浇水、中耕和除治病虫害；对每亩分蘖四十万株以下的三类田，普遍采用偏肥、偏水等特殊管理方法，促进升级。因此，全县小麦生长情况十分良好。目前，一、二类麦田共占麦田总面积的93％以上。
    科学管理、精益求精，使麦田管理工作逐步提高到新的技术水平，这是安国县今年麦田管理中的一个特点。全县各公社和生产队普遍建立了群众性的科学技术研究组织，发动人人学科学，个个钻技术。各地还在小麦丰产方内建立了科学研究站和综合化验室以及土壤化验、气象、技术研究、籽种、发明创造等组。这些技术组织，根据小麦生长过程中的各个关键时期，通过调查研究，因地因苗制宜地采取科学的管理措施，使麦田管理工作越作越细。
    以丰产方为骨干，以消灭低产田为重点，开展大面积丰产运动，是这个县夺取今年夏季全面大丰收的一项重要措施。全县共有小麦大面积丰产方八十八个，共二十一万多亩，占麦田总面积的70％以上。为了有计划地进行高额丰产试验和积累高额丰产经验，不断地丰富和提高小麦丰产的技术水平，各公社、生产队在丰产方内还培育了十五万多亩高额丰产田、指挥田、试验对比田和种籽田，其中仅县委、公社党委和生产队领导培育的高额丰产“王田”就有五万多亩。以这些丰产田为骨干，指挥和带动一般田。各地本着大面积丰产与全面丰收并重的精神，在大搞丰产方的同时，加强了对三类麦田的管理。经过这一段的精细管理，70％的三类苗已升了级。
    为了推动麦田管理工作的深入发展，实现夏季全面大丰收，各公社、生产队都广泛开展了“六赶”（三类苗赶二类苗、二类苗赶一类苗、一类苗赶“王田”、弱棵赶壮棵、低产赶高产、方方赶“第一田”）、“三超”（实产超包产、措施超指标、干劲超措施）的群众性超产竞赛运动，力争在包产的基础上再超产两三成。
