    Half
    Wu Lü
    Mechanization and automation are terms known in all countries; semi-mechanization and semi-automation, while not necessarily unique to China, are particularly prevalent here. This "half" is very important, very good, and deserves to be highlighted.

    However, it is said that some comrades do not particularly like this "half." They prefer full mechanization and dislike semi-mechanization; they prefer full automation and dislike semi-automation. In their view, only full mechanization and full automation are good; semi-mechanization and semi-automation are "half-baked," not solving the problem.

    Is this really the case? Of course not.

    It is a fact that fully mechanized factories are more efficient than semi-mechanized factories; it is also a fact that fully automated factories are more efficient than semi-automated factories. We do not favor semi-mechanization or semi-automation. Our ambition is to achieve full mechanization and full automation; and we also want to climb the peaks of world science and technology. We want everything that others have, and we will strive to create what others do not have.

    The problem is that the development of things progresses from nothing to something, from small to large, from incomplete to complete, from quantitative change to qualitative change. "Half" is a quantitative increase, and it is also an inevitable process of qualitative change. Only with "half a bottle of vinegar" can there be a full bottle of vinegar. The transition from manual operation to full mechanization inevitably goes through a process of semi-mechanization. The transition from mechanization to full automation also inevitably goes through a process of semi-automation. Even in the upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution movements, factories that achieve full mechanization or full automation in "one step," when examining their revolutionary process, this qualitative change is invariably accumulated from quantitative changes, only that the process from quantitative change to qualitative change is faster.

    It can be seen that the word "half" is very good. Semi-mechanization and semi-automation are not "not solving the problem," but solving the problem greatly. They are new things in the technical revolution and will continue to develop and grow. With semi-mechanization and semi-automation, there will be full mechanization and full automation.

    Whether or not to like the word "half," whether or not to have semi-mechanization and semi-automation, is essentially the same as whether or not to have small and medium-sized enterprises, whether or not to have indigenous production methods, which is a question of whether or not to have mass movements. People's understanding of objective things develops from ignorance to knowledge, from shallow to deep, from one-sided to comprehensive, from superficial to essential, as things develop. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, highlighting the word "half," adding semi-mechanization and semi-automation in addition to mechanization and automation, greatly helps to liberate thinking, break down the mysterious views on mechanization and automation, and mobilize the broadest masses of the people into the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Even if they have never seen automated factories or do not fully understand the principles of mechanization, they can start with semi-mechanization and semi-automation as their goal, start on their own, improve step by step, and gradually improve the degree of mechanization and automation from shallow to deep, from superficial to essential, following the laws of understanding, thereby achieving full mechanization and full automation more quickly. If we "emphasize the full and despise the half," only wanting mechanization and automation and not wanting semi-mechanization and semi-automation, the result will inevitably exclude the broad masses of the people from the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. If the technical innovation and technical revolution movement changes from a movement of the whole people to a movement of a few people, it will be difficult to have the ever-changing progress of production technology, and it will be difficult to have the high-speed development of socialist construction.

    Let us cheer loudly for semi-mechanization and semi-automation! With mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation as the center of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, our industry will surely develop more quickly in the direction of modernization.

    半

    机械化、自动化，是世界各国都有的名词；半机械化、半自动化，虽不一定是中国的独创，却是在中国特别盛行的。这“半”字，很重要，很好，值得大书特书。
    然而，据说有些同志不大喜欢这个“半”字。他们喜欢全盘机械化，不喜欢半机械化；喜欢全盘自动化，不喜欢半自动化。在他们看来，只有全盘机械化、全盘自动化才是好的；半机械化、半自动化，是“半瓶子醋”，不解决问题。
    事实果真是这样的吗？当然不是。
    全盘机械化的工厂比半机械化的工厂效率高，这是事实；全盘自动化的工厂比半自动化的工厂效率高，这也是事实。我们并不偏爱半机械化、半自动化。我们的雄心大志，是要实现全盘机械化、全盘自动化；并且还要攀登世界科学技术的高峰，一切别人有的我们都要有，别人没有的我们也要努力去创造。
    问题是事物的发展都是从无到有，从小到大，从不完全到完全，从量变到质变的。“半”是量的增长，也是质变的必然过程。有了“半瓶子醋”，才会有一瓶子醋。从手工操作到全盘机械化，必然要经过半机械化的过程。从机械化到全盘自动化，也必然要经过半自动化的过程。即使是在技术革新和技术革命运动的高潮中，“一步登天”，一下子就实现了全盘机械化或者全盘自动化的工厂，从他们革命的过程来考察，这种质的变化，也无一不是由量的变化积累而成的，只不过这个由量变到质变的过程更加迅速而已。
    可见，“半”字是好得很的。半机械化、半自动化，不是“不解决问题”，而是很解决问题。它是技术革命中的新生事物，是会不断发展，不断壮大的。有了半机械化、半自动化，就会有全盘机械化、全盘自动化。
    喜欢不喜欢“半”字，要不要半机械化、半自动化，实质上，同要不要中小企业、要不要土法生产一样，是一个要不要群众运动的问题。人们对客观事物的认识，是随着事物的发展，由无知到有知，由浅到深，由片面到全面、由表及里的。我们在技术革新和技术革命运动中突出一个“半”字，在机械化、自动化以外，加上半机械化、半自动化，就大大有利于解放思想，破除对机械化、自动化的神秘观点，能够把最广大的人民群众动员到技术革新和技术革命运动中来。那怕他们从来没有见过自动化的工厂、对机械化的原理也不甚了解，但是先以半机械化、半自动化为目标，就可以自己动起手来，走一步提高一步，循着认识的规律，由浅入深，由表及里，把机械化、自动化的程度逐步提高，从而更快地达到全盘机械化、全盘自动化。如果“重全轻半”，只要机械化、自动化，不要半机械化、半自动化，其结果必然会把广大人民群众排斥在技术革新和技术革命运动之外。技术革新和技术革命运动由全民的运动，变成少数人的运动，就很难有生产技术日新月异的进步，也就很难有社会主义建设的高速度发展。
    让我们为半机械化、半自动化大声喝彩！技术革新和技术革命运动以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心，必能使我国的工业更快地朝现代化的方向发展。
