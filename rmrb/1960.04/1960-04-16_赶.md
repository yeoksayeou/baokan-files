	Catch Up

	"Catch up," in our era today, reflects the national people's ambition to strive for the upper reaches and signifies the unfolding of a vigorous mass movement. It is precisely because of "catching up" that about one-third of the poor teams across the country caught up with the rich teams last year; many low-yield areas shed their "low-yield" labels; and backward areas caught up with the advanced.

	"Catch up," in terms of current agricultural production, means fully tapping production potential so that those backward, low-yield fields and third-class seedlings catch up with high-yield fields and first-class seedlings, striving to achieve overall increased production.

	The key to "catching" up lies in people having great drive. There are many reasons for the formation of low-yield fields and third-class seedlings, but the most fundamental reason is whether people's subjective efforts are sufficient. With enough drive and effort, people can turn bad land into good land, dry land into paddy fields, and, more importantly, transform extensive cultivation into intensive and meticulous farming. Aren't there already large-scale high-yield records being created in many remote mountainous areas, sandy wastelands, and saline-alkali lands across the country? Henan is currently launching a mass movement of a mighty army sweeping across low-yield fields and battling third-class seedlings. People are setting up camp in the fields, building deep wells in upland areas to irrigate those fields that have been arid for many years. Fertilizer bases are being built in areas with barren soil. Eliminating low-yield fields and third-class seedlings has formed a great and moving scene of transforming nature and making crops grow according to people's will. The drive of the people of Henan is commendable. With such drive, there is a guarantee of a comprehensive and bumper harvest of summer crops this year.

	To eliminate low-yield fields and third-class seedlings, in addition to having soaring drive, we must also have effective measures. What measures should be taken? This requires specific analysis of specific problems. Each commune and production team should assess the situation, investigate the causes of low yields, identify the loopholes in crop growth, and find solutions and add measures tailored to the problems. In this way, low-yield fields will definitely be able to catch up.

	When low-yield fields catch up with high-yield fields, high-yield fields will inevitably move towards even higher yields. You chase me, and we promote each other. This enables things to move forward continuously in development, thereby pushing the level of agricultural production in our country to new peaks wave after wave.

    “赶”，在我们今天的时代里，反映着全国人民力争上游的雄心壮志，意味着轰轰烈烈的群众运动的开展。正是因为赶，去年全国有三分之一左右的穷队赶上了富队；许多低产区摘掉了“低产”帽子；后进区赶上了先进。
    “赶”，在当前农业生产上来说，就是要充分发挥生产潜力，使那些落后的低产田、三类苗，迎头赶上高产田，赶上一类苗，力争实现全面增产。
    要迎头“赶”上，关键在于人们要有一个很大的干劲。形成低产田、三类苗的原因是多方面的，但是，最根本的原因是人的主观努力够不够。干劲足，工夫到，人能把坏地变好地、旱地变水田，更能把耕作粗放变为精耕细作。现在全国不是有很多偏僻的山区、沙荒地带、盐碱地已经创造了大面积高产的纪录吗？河南目前正在掀起一个千军万马横扫低产田、大战三类苗的群众运动，人们扎寨田头，在岗地上大打机井　要使那些长年枯旱的田地得到灌溉；土质瘠薄的地区正在大建肥料基地。消灭低产田、消灭三类苗，已经形成了一个改造自然、叫作物按照人的意志生长的伟大的动人的场面。河南人民的干劲是值得称赞的，有了这样的干劲，今年夏季作物全面大丰收就有了保证。
    消灭低产田、三类苗，除了有冲天的干劲，还要有有效的措施。究竟采取什么措施？这需要对具体问题作具体分析。每个公社、生产队都要摸摸底，查清楚低产的原因，找出作物生长不好的漏洞，对症下药地想办法，加措施。这样，低产田就一定能够迎头赶上。
    低产田赶上了高产田，高产田又必然走向更高产。你追我赶，相互促进，这就能使事物在发展中的不断前进，从而把我国农业生产的水平一浪又一浪地推向新的高峰。
