Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Good news continues to pour in from the industrial production front of socialist countries. On March 31, this newspaper published news that many industrial departments in North Korea and Poland had completed their first-quarter production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded quotas. Now, many industrial and mining enterprises in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania have also reported good news of completing the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas.

    Czechoslovakia

    Czechoslovakia's industrial production plan for the first quarter of this year has been overfulfilled. Compared with the same period last year, industrial production increased by 11%.

    Anthracite production has been excellent, with the quarterly plan exceeding the quota by 2.5%; a total of 7.6 million tons of anthracite was produced, an increase of 10% compared to the first quarter of 1959.

    The main reason for this achievement is the large-scale socialist competition launched by miners to welcome the 15th anniversary of the country's liberation (May 9). In March, the daily output of the Ostrava-Karvina coal mine reached 22,000 tons, setting an unprecedented record for the use of combined coal mining machines in the region.

    Electricity production also exceeded the quarterly plan by 3%, an increase of 14% compared to the same period last year. The Bratislava power station completed the quota for the entire second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) in mid-February.

    The production of steel, iron, and rolled steel all exceeded the first-quarter plan. Pig iron production reached over 1.1 million tons, an increase of 9.8% compared to the first quarter of 1959; rolled steel production reached 1.1 million tons, an increase of 16% compared to the first quarter of 1959.

    Cement production was 1.2 million tons, an increase of 18.5% compared to the same period last year. The output of the machinery industry increased by 12% compared to the same period last year.

    Bulgaria

    The Bulgarian working class, who are actively launching labor competitions to strive to complete the third Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) ahead of schedule this year, has achieved great achievements in production in the first quarter of this year. Many industrial and mining enterprises have completed the quarterly production plan ahead of schedule.

    The employees of the "Gavril Genov" factory in Ruse completed the first quarter production plan 17 days ahead of schedule. As of March 14, the factory had produced 500 tons of tinplate for the canning industry, which is approximately equivalent to the entire year's output in 1959. Now, all the employees of the factory are continuing to deepen the competition, striving to produce a total of 3,000 tons of high-quality tinplate this year.

    On the power production and power construction front, good news of completing the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule has also been frequently reported. The builders of the nation's largest "Maritsa-East" thermal power station, which is under construction, completed the first quarter plan 15 days ahead of schedule. They have already built the main factory building and other auxiliary factory buildings of the power station. The nation's first underground hydroelectric power station, the Batak Hydropower Station, also completed the first quarter production plan 12 days ahead of schedule. It has already produced more than 25 million kilowatt-hours of electricity.

    The employees of the metallurgical industry department have also achieved great achievements. The Srednogorci village mine in the Smolyan region has completed the first quarter plan for mining lead-zinc concentrate 15 days ahead of schedule and reduced production costs by 8.9%. The funds saved by the workers are more than twice the amount originally planned to be saved for the entire year.

    The electrification project of the Sofia-Plovdiv railway is accelerating. At the Kostinets station construction site, the working team headed by engineer Taikov completed the first quarter plan one month ahead of schedule. The railway workers also proposed a guarantee: strive to complete six months of the plan in three months.

    Romania

    A number of industrial and mining enterprises in Romania have completed the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule in the production competition movement.

    As in the past year, steel workers are once again at the forefront of the production competition movement. In the large-scale Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine, all workshops and production teams have completed or overfulfilled the production plan on schedule this year. Steelworkers at the Reșița Metallurgical Combine have also begun producing products for the second quarter. The above two enterprises have overfulfilled the first quarter plan for reducing product costs. In more than two months, they have saved a total of more than 80 million lei.

    Under the slogan of supporting steel workers, many miners who mine coal and iron sand have also completed the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule.

    Many oil drilling enterprises have greatly accelerated drilling speed after universally promoting advanced turbo drills.

    Many enterprises in the machinery manufacturing, building materials, and consumer goods industries have also completed the first quarter production plan. In basic construction work, many construction sites have also completed the first quarter construction tasks ahead of schedule. The workers building the dam of the Lenin Hydropower Station have poured more than 20,000 cubic meters of concrete this year, exceeding the plan.

    兄弟国家工业战线捷报频传
    捷克斯洛伐克第一季度工业生产比去年同期增长11％
    保加利亚和罗马尼亚很多工矿企业提前超额完成首季生产计划
    本报综合报道　社会主义国家工业生产战线上的捷报不断传来。3月31日本报已发表了朝鲜和波兰很多工业部门提前超额完成今年第一季度生产计划的消息。现在，捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚和罗马尼亚又传来了很多工矿企业提前和超额完成第一季度生产计划的喜讯。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    捷克斯洛伐克今年第一季度工业生产计划已超额完成。和去年同期相比，工业生产增长了11％。
    无烟煤生产成绩良好，季度计划已超额2.5％完成；共生产了七百六十万吨无烟煤，比1959年第一季度增加了10％。
    获得这个成绩的主要原因是矿工们为迎接祖国解放十五周年（5月9日）展开了大规模的社会主义竞赛。在3月间，俄斯特拉发—卡尔维那煤矿的日产量达到二万二千吨，创造了在这个地区使用联合采煤机的空前纪录。
    电力生产也超额3％完成了季度计划，和去年同期相比增加了14％。布拉迪斯拉发发电站在2月中旬就完成了整个第二个五年计划（1956—1960）的定额。
    钢、铁、辗钢的生产都超额完成了第一季度的计划，生铁产量达一百一十万吨以上，比1959年第一季度增加了9.8％；辗钢产量达一百一十万吨，比1959年第一季度增加了16％。
    水泥产量为一百二十万吨，比去年同期增加18.5％。机械工业的产量比去年同期增加了12％。
    保加利亚
    正在为争取在今年内提前完成第三个五年计划（1958—1962年）而积极展开劳动竞赛的保加利亚工人阶级，今年第一季度在生产上取得了巨大成就，许多工矿企业纷纷提前完成了季度生产计划。
    鲁西城“加夫里尔·格诺夫”工厂的职工们提前十七天完成了第一季度的生产计划。截至3月14日为止，这个工厂已经生产了五百吨罐头工业用的白铁皮，这个数字大约相当于1959年全年的产量。现在全厂职工正在继续深入展开竞赛，争取在今年内总共生产三千吨优质白铁皮。
    在电力生产和电力建设战线上，提前完成第一季度生产计划的捷报也在频频传来。正在兴建中的全国最大的“马里查—东方”热电站的建设者们，提前十五天完成了第一季度的计划，他们已经建成了发电站的主要厂房和其他一些辅助厂房。全国第一个地下水电站——巴塔克水电站也提前十二天完成了第一季度生产计划，它已经生产了二千五百多万度电。
    冶金工业部门的职工也取得了很大成就。斯摩里安州的斯列德诺戈尔齐村矿场已经提前十五天完成了开采铅锌精矿的第一季度计划，并且把生产成本降低了8.9％。工人们节约的资金比原定在今年全年所要节约的资金还多两倍。
    索非亚—普罗夫迪夫铁路的电气化工程正在加速进行。在科斯捷涅茨车站工地上，以塔伊科夫工程师为首的工作队提前一个月完成了第一季度计划。铁路工人们还提出保证：争取在三个月内完成六个月的计划。
    罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚一批工矿企业在生产竞赛运动中提前完成了第一季度生产计划。
    同去年一样，钢铁工人今年又走在生产竞赛运动的最前列。在规模宏大的洪尼多阿拉冶金联合工厂中，今年所有的车间和生产队都按时完成或超额完成生产计划。累希擦冶炼联合企业的炼钢工人也已开始生产第二季度的产品。以上两个企业都超额完成了第一季度关于降低产品成本的计划，在两个多月中，它们共节约了八千多万列伊。
    在支援钢铁工人的口号下，许多开采煤炭和铁砂的矿工也提前完成了第一季度生产计划。
    许多石油钻井企业在普遍推广先进的涡轮钻机后，大大加快了钻井速度。
    完成第一季度生产计划的还有机器制造、建筑材料和消费品工业部门的许多企业。在基本建设工作中，不少工地也都提前完成了第一季度的建设任务。建设列宁水电站大坝的工人们，今年已经超计划浇灌了两万多立方米的混凝土。
