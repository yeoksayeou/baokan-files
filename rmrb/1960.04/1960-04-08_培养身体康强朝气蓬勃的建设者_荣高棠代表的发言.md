Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully support the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin. Now I will talk about sports work.

In the first spring of the 1960s, all socialist construction undertakings in our country are showing a vibrant and prosperous scene. On the sports front, a magnificent and ever-changing mass exercise upsurge is unfolding nationwide. The number of people wielding rackets to play table tennis alone is in the tens of millions, and new sports records are constantly emerging. As socialist construction enters a year of high-speed, sustained leaps forward in 1960, sports work is also facing an unprecedentedly favorable situation.

Over the past ten years, sports have undergone fundamental changes. From being a tool used by the reactionary ruling class to make money, for entertainment, and to enslave the people, it has become a socialist cause led by the Party and used by the masses of the people to enhance their physical and mental health and serve production and national defense construction. The old and weak sports teams have been transformed, and a strong, proletarian sports force that is both red and expert is taking shape. Sports activities have developed from the narrow circles of pre-liberation days to the huge scale of hundreds of millions of people doing exercises and competing, enhancing the people's physique. The level of sports has risen from always being at the bottom in important international competitions to breaking nineteen world records thirty-two times and winning a world championship, winning honor for the motherland. These facts completely shattered the slander of imperialism, which in the past insulted the Chinese people as "the sick men of East Asia" and said that "sports technology is stepping in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries." At the same time, it proved Chairman Mao's brilliant conclusion at the founding of the country: "The era when the Chinese were considered uncivilized has passed. We will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture."

Through ten years of practice in sports, a set of brand-new sports work methods and work styles suitable for our country's conditions have also been gradually formed. For example, we have strengthened the Party's leadership in sports work, adhered to putting politics in command, followed the mass line, vigorously carried out mass movements, implemented the policy of walking on two legs, and closely combined popularization with improvement. Conducting a variety of sports activities around production, etc., are all effective basic experiences.

The achievement of these achievements and experiences is the result of the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and a vivid embodiment of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The new situation of the leap forward in sports that has emerged since 1958 has been formed under the inspiration of the three magic weapons created by the Party and Chairman Mao: the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune.

We deeply realize that Mao Zedong Thought is a model of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and it is also a guide for the victorious development of sports. It profoundly solves the relationship between sports and revolution, sports and production and national defense construction, sports and education, and so on.

The Party and Chairman Mao have always regarded carrying out sports activities as "an important political task of the Party" and have consistently cared about and attached importance to sports. At every historical period, there have been clear instructions on sports work. At the beginning of the founding of New China, Chairman Mao instructed: "Develop sports and enhance the people's physique." In 1953, Chairman Mao issued the call to young people across the country: "Good health, good study, good work." In 1957, in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," he pointed out: "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical education, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." In 1958, when Chairman Mao spoke of militia construction, which has important strategic significance, he proposed that the militia division "is a military organization, a labor organization, an education organization, and a sports organization." Recently, Chairman Mao instructed that, wherever possible, we should advocate doing exercises, playing ball, swimming, running, climbing mountains, practicing Tai Chi, and all kinds of sports. These instructions clearly and correctly point out the nature, purpose, tasks, and direction of advancement of the people's sports cause, and profoundly reflect the great leader's full attention and great concern for the development of sports.

Why does Chairman Mao attach so much importance to sports? Because sports are beneficial to production, work, study, and people's construction and defense of a happy life, and it is directly related to the great construction of socialism and communism. The purpose of the proletarian revolution and construction is to develop production at high speed and continuously improve the people's material and cultural living standards. The development of social production relies on the revolution of productive forces and production relations. The most important, most active, and most vital factor of the productive forces is people. The physical and mental state of people has a major impact on their role in production. Only by liberating people from the shackles of mind and body can we fully unleash their subjective initiative, develop production at high speed, create history, transform the world, and build a better life. Sports is one of the basic means of cultivating a new generation with all-round development of morality, intelligence, and physical education, and it is an important aspect of the great cultural revolution to transform the Chinese people from weakness to strength and from backwardness to advanced. It makes people strong and healthy and prolongs life. Through exercise and competition, it can also change people's mental outlook, making them able to withstand wind and rain, encouraging them to compare heights and compete for victory, and helping to cultivate people's excellent qualities such as bravery, tenacity, striving for progress, and collectivism. In the sports field, people can not only see those participating in exercise and competition as being full of vigor, but also the audience is infected by the tense and enthusiastic atmosphere on the field, inspired by the desire to strive for victory, discussing with enthusiasm, and spiritually uplifted. People can engage in some sports activities in the morning and evening, during holidays, and in their spare time, which can enliven people's emotions, add poetry and painting to their lives, and enable people to carry out production, work, and study in a pleasant mood and with full energy. Many sports projects, especially national defense sports projects, also directly help people master scientific knowledge and military skills. As Chairman Mao pointed out in an early famous sports paper, the effect of sports lies in "strengthening muscles and bones, increasing knowledge, regulating emotions, and strengthening will," and it is of great significance to "managing life and defending the country." He further criticized the erroneous theories that have been circulating for thousands of years, such as Lao Tzu's "inaction is great" and Sakyamuni's "striving for tranquility," from a philosophical point of view. Using the viewpoint of materialist dialectics, he pointed out that the world only has movement, and people must move in order to have vitality and energy, to change themselves, and to civilize their spirit, and that sports is a kind of movement that conforms to scientific rules. Chairman Mao advocated sports and advocated that people must develop in an all-round way in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical education, and that both body and spirit must be healthy.

In recent years, we have followed the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao, extensively carried out mass sports activities in urban and rural areas, enhanced the people's physique, and revitalized the national spirit. Starting from reality, we have boldly mobilized the masses, carried out a variety of sports activities according to time, place, and people. Climbing mountains where there are mountains, swimming in water where there is water, running, jumping, and shooting on the ground, gliding and parachuting in the air, vigorously carrying out ice and snow sports in winter, and millions of people swimming in lakes and seas in summer. As for broadcast exercises, production exercises, table tennis, and folk sports activities such as martial arts, wrestling, tug-of-war, and rope skipping, which are not affected by venues and seasons, are carried out even more universally. Many old people enthusiastically exercise in their happy old age, describing themselves as: "In the past, I didn't like to move, and used a crutch as a leg; now I exercise often, and use a crutch as a sword." The workers in the finishing workshop of the Beijing State No. 3 Cotton Factory actively participated in sports exercises, and have maintained full attendance in production for two years. The broad masses of rural women participating in sports activities not only enhance their physique and are beneficial to production, but also have a great role in changing customs and habits. The young women of five production teams of the Peizhuang People's Commune in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, organized the "Seagull Exercise Team." When it was first established in 1956, some old-fashioned people composed fast rhythms to satirize them: "Young wives and girls, jumping around is not decent." Some old people also prevented their daughters-in-law from participating. But they still persisted in exercising in addition to doing a good job in production, and several weak and sick team members also trained to become strong laborers. They also often organized themselves to successfully complete the rush production tasks assigned by the production team and the commune, and the experimental fields of wheat and cotton they planted were also rated as county-level high-yield units. The entire team also became a provincial sports red banner and attended the National Congress of Active Elements and Advanced Representatives in Agricultural Socialist Construction. Faced with the facts, those who composed the fast rhythms had to change their words and sing: "This group of women is not simple, they exercise and engage in production, they take the lead in everything, and everyone likes them when they see them?" The old people sent their daughters-in-law to participate in the "Seagull" team, and young people wanted to find a "Seagull" team member who was both capable and lively as their object, which was once praised as a good story. This team not only motivated the commune members to actively exercise, but also the girls who have married out of the team in recent years bring new teams organized locally back to their parents' home for competitions during festivals. In mass sports activities, there are countless examples like this that invigorate the mind and body, break through the feudal residual thoughts that fetter people left over from the old society, change the old habit of preferring stillness to movement, and establish a fashion of everyone strengthening their body and practicing martial arts. Only in the Mao Zedong era, when sports has become the wealth of the whole people, can it play such a huge role.

The great era is bound to produce a great spirit; and the great spirit can promote the development of the era. The Party's general line for socialist construction has fully mobilized the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the people, and promoted the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in various constructions since 1958. Inspired by this general line, the sports team has been full of vigor and high spirits to promote the unprecedented achievements of sports. This spirit of the reaction of matter to social consciousness and of social consciousness to social existence is visible everywhere. For example, in sports competitions, when athletes encounter equally matched or even more skilled opponents, they can often turn parity into advantage or turn weakness into strength and win victory by giving full play to their subjective initiative. Taking the table tennis players who have been popular in recent years as an example, following Rong Guotuan's victory in the men's singles world championship among more than 200 players from 38 countries and regions, the young table tennis players such as Zhuang Zedong and Li Furong also achieved great success in their visit to Europe in the autumn and winter of last year. Holding the ambition to win glory for the country, they were not afraid of some foreign veterans, despising their opponents strategically and paying attention to their opponents tactically, achieving both breaking superstitions, being high-spirited, and conscientiously and arduously fighting for every round, giving full play to my country's unique style of table tennis, such as fast, ruthless, accurate, and diverse attacking serves. They won a brilliant victory of five wins and one draw in the UK and won four championships and four runner-ups in international competitions in Sweden and Hungary. Some European newspapers described them as "always full of emotions and focused during the game, and the more they lag behind, the more tenacious they are." They praised them for "good style, good playing style, and good sportsmanship," saying that "I have never seen such a happy and friendly sports team." It can be seen that this is not only a technical success of Chinese athletes, but also a victory of excellent moral qualities and communist style.

Under the kind education of the Party and Chairman Mao, a new generation like this, who is both red and expert, dare to think and dare to act, is constantly growing up.

In the First National Games alone, seven people broke four world records and 664 people broke national records 844 times, many of whom were novices. For example, Mei Yan, Guo Xin'e, and Zhang Jingwen, who created the world record for women's parachuting, had been learning parachuting for less than a year; Ding Zhaofang, who won the women's singles gymnastics championship, was only twelve years old; among the fifteen members of the Hebei team, which won the second place in the women's swimming team overall score, fourteen were Young Pioneers; and Wei Lie, a fifteen-year-old Oroqen hunter, also broke the national shooting record. This shows a moving picture of new talents emerging in my country's sports, constantly growing and surpassing.

Practice has proved that Mao Zedong Thought guides us to constantly move from victory to victory. At present, a wave of studying Marxism-Leninism and studying Chairman Mao's works has formed in the sports world and will be carried out widely and persistently in depth. Arming the sports team with Mao Zedong Thought and transforming the sports team is a long-term and arduous task on the sports front. Sports workers must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution, implement Chairman Mao's instructions, and, with the great spirit of changing customs and habits to transform the world, set off a vigorous upsurge of national sports, publicize it vigorously, and make it known to every household, so that everyone will take action, and everyone will participate in at least ten minutes of sports activities every day. The elderly and the weak can practice Tai Chi, take a walk, or do exercises; in addition to participating in sports activities according to their hobbies and conditions, young people should actively participate in ten major projects such as basketball, volleyball, football, table tennis, track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics, skating, and shooting, and strive to improve their sports level. We believe that everything depends on people, as long as we hold high the victorious banner of Mao Zedong Thought, rely on the Party, rely on the masses, we will definitely be able to make great achievements in a short period of time, welcome the convening of the National Congress of Heroes on the cultural and educational front, and carry out the mass sports movement wave after wave, so that physical and mental sports become a necessity for everyone's life and become a new fashion in society, thereby promoting the general enhancement of the people's physique, the further revitalization of the national spirit, and the rapid climbing of sports technology to the world peak, so as to better serve the glorious socialist construction.

    培养身体康强朝气蓬勃的建设者
    荣高棠代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念、谭震林副总理的报告，现在我谈谈体育工作。
    六十年代的第一个春天，我国各项社会主义建设事业都呈现出一片生气勃勃、欣欣向荣的景象。在体育战线上，一个波澜壮阔、气象万千的群众锻炼高潮正在全国范围内展开，单是挥拍上阵赛乒乓球的人就数以千万计，各项运动新纪录不断涌现。在社会主义建设进入高速度持续跃进的1960年，体育工作也面临着空前未有的大好形势。
    十年来，体育运动发生了根本的变化。从被反动统治阶级用以赚钱、消遣、奴役人民的工具，变成为党所领导的、人民大众用以增进身心健康，为生产和国防建设服务的社会主义事业。旧的微弱的体育队伍得到了改造，一支又红又专的工人阶级的强大的体育队伍正在形成。体育活动从解放前狭小的圈子，发展到成亿人做操竞技的巨大规模，增强了人民的体质，运动水平从过去在重要国际比赛中总是名落孙山，提高到三十二次打破十九项世界纪录和出现一项世界冠军，为祖国争得了荣誉。这些事实彻底粉碎了帝国主义过去侮辱中国人民为“东亚病夫”、“运动技术在十八、十九世纪踏步”的谰调。同时证明了毛主席开国时的英明论断：“中国人被认为不文明的时代已经过去了，我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界”。
    通过体育运动十年来的实践，还逐步形成了一套崭新的、适合我国情况的体育工作方法和工作作风。譬如，我们在体育工作中加强了党的领导，坚持政治挂帅；走群众路线，大搞群众运动；贯彻两条腿走路的方针，使普及与提高密切结合起来；围绕生产开展多种多样体育活动等等，都是行之有效的基本经验。
    这些成就和经验的取得，是党中央英明领导的结果，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的生动体现。1958年以来出现的体育跃进新局面，就是在党和毛主席创造的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的鼓舞下形成的。
    我们深深体会到毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的典范，也是胜利地发展体育运动的指针。它深刻地解决了体育与革命、体育与生产和国防建设、体育与教育等等的关系问题。
    党和毛主席历来都把开展体育运动看成“是党的一项重要政治任务”，一贯关怀和重视体育运动。在各个历史时期对体育工作都有明确的指示。新中国成立初期，毛主席指示：“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”。1953年，毛主席向全国青年发出了“身体好，学习好，工作好”的号召。1957年，他在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中指出：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。1958年，毛主席讲到具有重要战略意义的民兵建设时，提出民兵师“是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织。”最近，毛主席又指示，凡能做到的，都要提倡做操、打球、游泳、跑步、爬山、打太极拳，以及各种各色的体育运动。这些指示，非常明白地正确地指出了人民体育事业的性质、目的、任务和前进的方向，深刻体现了伟大领袖对发展体育运动的充分重视和巨大关怀。
    毛主席为什么这样重视体育运动呢？因为体育运动有利于生产，有利于工作，有利于学习，有利于人们建设和保卫幸福的生活，它直接关系着社会主义和共产主义的伟大建设。无产阶级革命和建设的目的是高速度地发展生产，不断提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。社会生产的发展依靠生产力与生产关系的革命，生产力中最主要、最积极、最活跃的因素是人。人的身体和精神状态对人在生产中的作用具有重大影响。只有从精神、身体各方面解除对人的束缚，才能充分发挥人的能动作用，高速度地发展生产，创造历史，改造世界，建设美好生活。体育运动是培养德智体全面发展一代新人的基本手段之一，是使我国人民变病弱为强健，变落后为先进的伟大文化革命的一个重要方面。它使人身强力壮，延年益寿。通过锻炼、比赛，还可以改变人的精神面貌，使人经得起风霜雨雪，激励人去比高低，争胜负，有助于培养人的勇敢、顽强、力争上游、集体主义等优良品质。在体育场上，人们不仅可以看到参加锻炼、比赛的人，生龙活虎，就是满座观众也为场上紧张热烈的气氛所感染，为力争胜利的愿望所激励，议论风生，精神振奋。人们在晨昏朝夕，在节日假期、工间业余进行一些体育活动，可以活跃人的情绪，增添生活的诗情画意，使人心情舒畅、精神饱满地进行生产、工作和学习。许多运动项目特别是国防体育项目还直接帮助人们掌握科学知识和军事技能。正如毛主席早年一篇著名的体育论文中指出的，体育的功效在于“强筋骨，增知识，调感情，强意志”，对“营生、卫国”具有重大意义。还进一步从哲学思想上，批驳了老子的“无动为大”、释迦牟尼的“务求寂静”等流传了几千年的错误学说。以唯物辩证的观点指出，天地唯有动，人要动才有生气活力，才能改变自身，才能文明其精神，而体育就是一种合乎科学规则的运动。毛主席提倡体育，主张人必须德智体全面发展，身体与精神都要健康。
    几年来，我们遵循着党和毛主席的指示，广泛地开展城乡群众性体育运动，增强人民体质，振奋民族精神。从实际出发，放手发动群众，因时因地因人制宜，开展多种多样体育活动。有山登山，有水游水，地上跑跳、射击，空中滑翔、跳伞，冬季大搞冰雪运动，夏天千万人游湖闹海，至于不受场地、季节影响的广播操、生产操、乒乓球，以及武术、摔跤、拔河、跳绳等民间体育活动，开展更为普遍。许多老年人在幸福的晚年兴致勃勃地锻炼身体，他们形容自己：“昔日不爱动，拐杖当腿用；如今常锻炼，拐杖当宝剑。”北京国棉三厂整理车间工人们积极参加了体育锻炼，两年来生产上保持了全勤。广大农村妇女参加体育活动，不仅体质增强，有利生产，而且大有移风易俗的作用。山西万荣县裴庄人民公社五个生产队的女青年组织了“海鸥锻炼队”，1956年刚成立的时候，有些旧脑筋的人编快板讽刺她们：“年轻媳妇大姑娘，蹦蹦跳跳不像样”。有些老年人还阻止女儿媳妇参加。但她们仍在搞好生产之余，坚持锻炼身体，几个体弱多病的队员也练成了壮劳动力。她们还常常组织起来出色地完成生产队和公社交给的突击生产任务，自己种的小麦、棉花试验田也被评为县的丰产单位。全队还成为省的体育运动红旗，出席了全国农业社会主义建设积极分子和先进代表大会。在事实面前，那些编快板的人不得不改口唱道：“这群妇女不简单，锻炼身体搞生产，处处带头起模范，谁人见了不喜欢？”老年人送女儿媳妇参加“海鸥”队，青年人要找既能干又活泼的“海鸥”队员当对象，一时传为佳话。这个队不仅带动了全社社员积极锻炼，就是几年来从队里嫁到外地的姑娘，逢年过节还带着在当地组织的新队回娘家比赛。在群众体育活动中，像这样活泼身心，冲破旧社会遗留下来的束缚人的封建残余思想，改变好静不好动的旧习惯，树立人人强身练武的风尚的事例是举不胜举的。体育运动只有在它成为全民财富的毛泽东时代，才能发挥这样巨大的作用。
    伟大的时代，必然产生伟大的精神；伟大的精神又可以促进时代的发展。党的社会主义建设总路线充分调动了人民的积极性、主动性和创造性，促成了1958年以来各项建设大跃进的新局面。体育队伍在这条总路线的鼓舞下，意气风发、干劲冲天地促使体育运动获得了空前未有的成就，这种精神对于物质、社会意识对于社会存在的反作用，是处处可见的。例如，在运动竞赛中，运动员遇到势均力敌甚至比自己高明的对手时，往往由于充分发挥了主观能动性，就可以变均势为优势或转弱为强，夺得胜利，拿近年来人们喜闻乐道的乒乓选手来说，继容国团在三十八个国家和地区的二百多名好手中夺得男子单打世界冠军之后，庄则栋、李富荣等乒乓小将去年秋冬之交访问欧洲也获得很大的成功。他们抱着为国争光的雄心，在一些外国老手面前毫无惧色，战略上藐视对手，战术上重视对手，做到既破除迷信，斗志昂扬，又兢兢业业，艰苦地争夺每一个回合，充分发挥了我国乒乓球快、狠、准、多样性攻击发球等独特风格，在英国获得了五胜一平的辉煌胜利，在瑞典、匈牙利参加国际比赛获得四项冠军和四项亚军。一些欧洲报刊形容他们“比赛时始终情绪饱满，全神贯注，越是在比分落后的情况下，越是顽强”。夸他们“作风好，打法好，体育道德好”，说“从来没有见过这样愉快而友好的运动队”。可见，这不仅是中国运动员技巧上的成功，而且是优良道德品质和共产主义风格的胜利。
    在党和毛主席亲切教导下，像这样又红又专，敢想敢干的新一代正在不断地成长起来。
    单是在第一届全国运动会上，就有七人打破四项世界纪录，六百六十四人八百四十四次破全国纪录，其中许多都是新手。如创造女子跳伞世界纪录的梅严、郭新娥、张景文，学跳伞还不到一年；夺得女子单人技巧运动冠军的丁照芳只有十二岁；获得女子游泳团体总分第二名的河北队十五名队员中十四人是红领巾；十五岁的鄂伦春族小猎手畏列也打破了射击全国纪录。这都显示了我国体育运动新人辈出，生生不已，后来居上的动人图景。
    实践证明，毛泽东思想引导着我们不断从胜利走向胜利。目前，学习马列主义学习毛主席著作的热潮，已在体育界形成，并将广泛持久地深入开展。以毛泽东思想武装体育队伍，改造体育队伍，是体育战线上一项长期的、艰巨的任务。体育工作者要认真学习毛主席不断革命的思想，贯彻毛主席的指示，以移风易俗改造世界的伟大气概，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的全民体育运动高潮，大张旗鼓，大做宣传，使之家喻户晓，人人行动起来，每人每天至少参加十分钟体育活动。老年、体弱的人可以打打太极拳、散散步、做做操；青少年除了根据爱好和条件参加体育活动外，要积极参加篮球、排球、足球、乒乓球和田径、游泳、举重、体操、滑冰、射击等十个主要项目，努力提高运动水平。我们相信，事在人为，只要我们高举毛泽东思想的胜利旗帜，依靠党，依靠群众，一定能在短时期内做出大成绩，迎接全国文教战线群英会的召开，并把群众体育运动一浪高一浪地开展下去，使有益身心的体育运动，成为人人生活之必需，成为社会的新风尚，从而促使人民体质普遍增强，民族精神更加奋发，运动技术迅速攀上世界高峰，更好地为光辉的社会主义建设服务。
