Fully Utilize All Resources, First Strengthen Weak Links
Anhui Develops Various “Small-Scale Foreign Groups”
This Year to Build More Than 1,100 Small Industrial Projects Centered on Steel

　　(Our newspaper, Hefei, April 24th) On the basis of the great achievements of steel "small-scale foreign groups," Anhui Province is further developing various "small-scale foreign groups" centered on steel. According to preliminary plans, the province will build more than 1,100 "small-scale foreign group" projects this year, including iron smelting, mining, coal, coke production, non-ferrous metals, machinery, electricity, chemicals, petroleum, building materials, and light industry. At the same time, 49 simple railways will also be built.

　　Currently, many newly built and renovated "small-scale foreign group" projects have started construction, and some have been completed and put into production. Of the more than 1,100 "small-scale foreign group" projects planned for construction this year, 523 have started construction in the first half of the year. Most of the more than 100 No. 3 simple coke ovens planned for construction this year have already started, with six already completed, and most of the rest can be completed before June. Thirty-four fertilizer plants with an annual output of 800 tons of synthetic ammonia have started construction, and three have already been put into production. Fifteen earthen railways are under intensive construction. Twelve pairs of small foreign coal mine shafts are undergoing capital construction. Eleven small mines have undergone renovations, basically achieving vehicle-based transportation, mechanized drilling, and adding a lot of ventilation, lighting, drainage and other equipment.

　　Since the large-scale steel production campaign began in 1958, Anhui Province has vigorously promoted the construction of "small-scale foreign groups," from indigenous methods to foreign methods. The great development of the iron and steel industry has also promoted the development of mining, coal washing, coke production, and refractory materials.

　　The principle of Anhui Province for further developing "small-scale foreign groups" this year is: build where there are resources, and develop first where there are weak links. According to this principle, Anhui Province's specific practices are: focus on weak links such as non-ferrous metals, chemicals, mining, coal, electricity, and building materials. For example, in the metallurgical field, it is planned to build 206 "small-scale foreign group" projects, of which non-ferrous metals account for 54. Of the 215 chemical construction projects, various fertilizer construction projects account for 125. After the 234 newly built and renovated small coal mines are put into production, the annual production capacity will reach 6.17 million tons. After the renovation of the eleven small mines is completed, the annual production capacity will increase to 4.3 million tons. In the construction of "small-scale foreign groups," overall arrangements have been made based on the principles of proximity to raw materials, proximity to existing enterprises, convenient transportation, and proximity to water and electricity, making the layout of the "small-scale foreign groups" more rational.

　　Anhui Province and various localities, based on the principles of self-reliance and making do with whatever is available, have solved the difficulties of insufficient funds, equipment, raw materials, and manpower required for the construction of "small-scale foreign groups." The labor force required for newly built small enterprises is mainly solved through the technical revolution and adjustment of labor organization in existing enterprises to save labor. Some "small-scale foreign group" enterprises also adopt the method of county-commune joint ventures.

　　While vigorously building new "small-scale foreign group" enterprises, Anhui Province also continuously carries out technological transformation of existing "small-scale foreign group" enterprises in conjunction with production, strengthens weak links in production, strengthens enterprise management, and enables the production level of existing small enterprises to be greatly improved.

    充分利用一切资源　首先加强薄弱环节
    安徽发展各种“小洋群”
    今年将以钢铁为中心新建一千一百多个小型工业项目
    本报合肥24日电　安徽省在钢铁“小洋群”获得巨大成就的基础上，正在以钢铁为中心进一步发展各种“小洋群”。据初步规划，今年全省将新建一千一百多个“小洋群”项目，其中包括炼铁、矿山、煤炭、炼焦、有色金属、机械、电力、化工、石油、建筑材料及轻工业等方面。同时，还将建设简易铁路四十九条。
    目前，许多新建改建的“小洋群”项目已经开工建设，有的已建成投入生产。在今年计划建设的一千一百多个“小洋群”项目中，上半年开工建设的就有五百二十三个。今年计划建设的一百多座三号简易焦炉，大部分已动工建设，目前已建成的有六座，其余大部分可以在6月份以前建成。年产八百吨合成氨的化肥厂已有三十四座动工兴建，有三座已经投入生产。有十五条土铁路正在加紧施工。十二对煤矿小洋井正在进行基建。十一个小型矿山经过改建，已基本实现了运输车子化，打眼土机械化，增添了不少的通风、照明、排水等设备。
    安徽省从1958年大办钢铁开始，就由土到洋大搞“小洋群”建设。钢铁工业的大发展，也推动了采矿、洗煤、炼焦、耐火材料的发展。
    今年安徽省进一步大搞“小洋群”的原则是：那里有资源就在那里建设，那方面是薄弱环节就首先从那方面发展。根据这一原则，安徽省的具体作法是：大抓有色金属、化工、矿山、煤、电、建筑材料等薄弱环节。如冶金方面计划建设二百零六个“小洋群”项目，其中有色金属就占五十四项。在二百一十五项化工建设项目中，各种化肥的建设项目就有一百二十五个。新建和改建的二百三十四个小煤井投入生产后，年产能力达六百一十七万吨。十一个小型矿山改建完工后，年产能力将增加到四百三十万吨。在“小洋群”建设中，根据就原料、就原有企业、就交通方便、就水电的原则，做了统筹安排，使“小洋群”的布局更加合理。
    安徽各地还本着自力更生和因陋就简的原则，解决了建设“小洋群”所需的资金、设备、原料材料和人力不足的困难。新建小型企业所需要的劳动力，主要是通过现有企业的技术革命和调整劳动组织节约出的劳动力调剂解决。有些“小洋群”企业，还采取县社合营的办法兴办。
    在大力建设新的“小洋群”企业的同时，安徽省对现有“小洋群”企业还结合生产，不断地进行技术改造，加强生产中的薄弱环节，加强企业管理，使现有小型企业的生产水平有更大的提高。（附图片）
