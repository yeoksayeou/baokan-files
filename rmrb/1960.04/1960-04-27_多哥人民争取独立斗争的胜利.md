The Victory of the Togolese People's Struggle for Independence

Togo is a country on the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa. It has a land area of 55,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 1.2 million.

Like all colonies and semi-colonies, the history of the Togolese people is a history of blood and tears of oppression and enslavement. Ancient Togo was a free country in West Africa, composed of many independent tribes and small kingdoms. In the mid-15th century, Portuguese colonists first invaded Togo, followed by British, French, and German colonists, who engaged in large-scale and heinous slave-grabbing activities. In 1884, Togo was annexed by Germany. After the First World War, Britain and France divided Togo, with Britain occupying the west and France occupying the east. After the Second World War, the United Nations, disregarding the Togolese people's desire for independence, decided to continue to place Togo under the "trusteeship" of Britain and France. In 1957, after Ghana became independent, western Togo was incorporated into Ghana. The Togo that has now achieved independence is the one under French "trusteeship."

For a long time, the Togolese people have resolutely fought for national independence. In order to demand an end to the "trusteeship" status, the Togolese people have sent representatives to appeal at every session of the United Nations General Assembly, demanding independence. In 1956, the Togolese people launched large-scale actions against French colonial rule in Lomé and other places. In order to ease the Togolese people's struggle, the French colonists announced in August 1956 that Togo was an "autonomous republic" within the French Community, and then, in October, they played the trick of a plebiscite. However, this trick of France was resolutely resisted by the Togolese people, and the number of people who participated in the vote was less than 8% of the Togolese population. In July 1957, the United Nations sent a special investigation committee to Togo, and wherever it went, it encountered mass rallies and demonstrations. In Lomé, Togolese patriots, regardless of the heavy encirclement of heavily armed French colonial police, lowered the flag of the "autonomous republic" in the face of the investigation committee. The French colonial authorities carried out brutal massacres of the Togolese people, but the Togolese people were not intimidated. Under the call of the Togolese trade unions, 80% of the workers and staff in Togo held a forty-eight-hour protest strike.

Since the "autonomy" scheme was bankrupted by the opposition of the Togolese people, the French colonists were forced to agree to hold new legislative assembly elections in April 1958. According to the regulations, the government produced by this legislative assembly would make decisions on the abolition of the "trusteeship" system and the future of Togo. Therefore, this election became an important struggle between the Togolese people and the French colonists. The French colonists attempted to "legally" incorporate Togo into the French Community through this election, so they constantly threatened and bribed the Togolese people before the election. However, the Unité Togolaise (Togolese Unity Committee) and the Juvento (Togolese Youth Movement) that demanded national independence, with the support of the Togolese people, finally won a two-thirds majority. The government that supported France was declared collapsed. This was a major victory for the Togolese people's struggle for national independence. In the face of the Togolese people's strong national independence movement, France had to agree to the independence of Togo. (Jin)

    多哥人民争取独立斗争的胜利
    多哥是西非几内亚湾畔的一个国家。土地面积五万五千平方公里，人口约一百二十万。
    像所有的殖民地与半殖民地一样，多哥人民的历史是一部被压迫被奴役的血泪史。古代的多哥是西非的自由国家，它由许多独立的部落和小王国组成。十五世纪中叶葡萄牙殖民者首先侵入多哥，接着来的是英、法、德殖民者，它们在当地进行大规模掠夺奴隶的罪恶活动。1884年多哥被德国吞并。到第一次世界大战后，英法两国瓜分了多哥，英国占领西部，法国占领东部。第二次世界大战后，联合国不顾多哥人民的独立愿望，决定把多哥分别交由英法两国继续“托管”。1957年，加纳独立后，西部多哥并入了加纳。现在取得独立的是法国“托管”的多哥。
    多哥人民长期以来坚决为争取民族独立而斗争，为了要求结束“托管”地位，在历届联合国大会上，多哥人民都派遣代表提出呼吁，要求独立。1956年，多哥人民在洛莫等地曾经展开反对法国殖民统治的大规模行动。法国殖民者为了缓和多哥人民的斗争，在1956年8月宣布多哥为法兰西联邦内的“自治共和国”，又在10月玩弄了公民投票的把戏。但是法国的这种骗局受到多哥人民的坚决抵制，参加这次投票的人数不到多哥人口的8％。1957年7月，联合国派特别调查委员会去多哥，所到之处，几乎都碰到了群众的集会和示威游行。在洛美，多哥爱国者不顾全副武装的法国殖民警察的重重包围，当着调查委员会的面，降下了“自治共和国”的国旗。法国殖民当局对多哥人民进行了残暴的屠杀活动，但是多哥人民并没有被吓倒。在多哥工会的号召下，多哥有80％的工人与职员举行了四十八小时的抗议罢工。
    法国殖民者由于“自治”阴谋在多哥人民的反对下遭到破产，被迫同意在1958年4月重新举行立法议会选举。根据规定，由这次立法议会产生的政府，将就废除“托管”制度以及多哥的前途问题作出决定。因此这次选举成为多哥人民同法国殖民者之间的一场重要的斗争。法国殖民者企图通过这次选举“合法”地把多哥并入法兰西联邦内，因此在选举前不断对多哥人民进行威胁利诱。但是，要求民族独立的多哥统一委员会和青年党所组成的统一阵线，在多哥人民的支持下，终于获得了三分之二的多数。支持法国的政府宣告垮台。这是多哥人争取民族独立斗争的重大胜利。在多哥人民强大的民族独立运动面前，法国不得不同意多哥独立。　（金）
