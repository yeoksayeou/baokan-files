In the Big Family of the Urban People's Commune
——Observations on Several Urban People's Communes in Tianjin By Our Newspaper's Tianjin Correspondent

Since the establishment of the first Hongshunli People's Commune in Tianjin more than a year ago, the bright red banner of the People's Commune has taken root in people's hearts. In recent days, the streets and alleys of Tianjin have become even more lively, with red "double happiness" characters pasted everywhere to celebrate the establishment of the communes. Elderly women, wearing new clothes, happily go to the "registration office" to apply to join the People's Commune. The People's Communes, which the street residents had been eagerly anticipating, are being established one after another.

We visited several of the earlier established communes. These communes have undergone profound changes in all aspects over the past year. What excited us the most, and what left us with the deepest impression, besides the thousands of factories built from scratch, the public canteens overflowing with the aroma of vegetables and meat, the tidy nurseries, the laughter-filled kindergartens, the quiet homes for the elderly, the versatile service stations willing to serve the members, and the brightly lit commune evening schools, were the people here, the thousands upon thousands of ordinary people in the communes.

　　For the Commune, For the Collective

There are two elderly women in the Fourth Branch of the Guozhuangzi People's Commune, one is 54-year-old Li Xiuying, the head of the branch, and the other is 48-year-old Liu Shuying, the deputy head. They are both ordinary, simple, and approachable elderly women, but they embody lofty communist ideals. As early as 1958, they organized several housewives to do packaging and painting work. At that time, they had nothing; the five women doing painting only had a few small iron buckets. They worked in all kinds of weather, starting early and working late, accumulating money penny by penny. With income, they added tools, bought raw materials, and built factories. Gradually, the painting group developed into an electrical appliance factory, and the packaging group became a packaging factory, with monthly output value increasing from tens of yuan to thousands of yuan to tens of thousands of yuan. However, for a long time, they never thought of themselves, and worked tirelessly for the collective without regard for personal compensation.

Countless people with such noble character can be found in various People's Communes. In March, the Guanghua Branch of the Hongshunli People's Commune had the following incident: the branch wanted to establish a canteen in Yuanfuli, and as soon as it announced that it needed three cooks, Wang Shulan signed up and vacated two rooms of her house to serve as the canteen's kitchen; Liu Suqin of the hat-making production group and Shi Enrong of the hardware processing group, who originally earned forty to fifty yuan a month in their production groups, volunteered to work as unpaid cooks in the canteen after hearing about the organization of the canteen, resolutely stating that they would not seek compensation. The old people worked with great energy, busy from morning till night. After carrying water and buying vegetables, they went door to door to find out what kind of food the members liked to eat every day, and delivered food and water to the elderly, lonely, sick, and disabled members. When worker Wu Xiuqin gave birth, Shi Enrong went to deliver food one time. Wu Xiuqin said, "Uncle Shi, please tell the canteen to make me a bowl of noodles." Shi Enrong agreed at the time, but then he thought, "Pressed noodles are too hard for someone who just gave birth, and they are difficult to digest." He returned to the kitchen and made a bowl of soft and tender noodles himself, which moved Wu Xiuqin so much that she didn't know what to say.

　　New Relationships, New People

In the big family of the commune, communist morality is growing everywhere, and the relationship between people is linked together by a lofty ideal.

In the past, some housewives would chat idly with their children after cooking, gossiping about this family and that, or comparing food and clothing. Now, it is different. People care about production, the commune collective, and building socialism, and their horizons are much broader. What wives and husbands discuss is no longer limited to household chores such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt, but mainly about production, learning, and technical innovation. In February of this year, the Fourth Branch of the Guozhuangzi People's Commune held a conference for the chalk-making production group to mobilize the masses to vigorously engage in technical innovation. After the meeting, Zhang Yuzhen of the production group went home to discuss it with her husband, Xiao Qingzhong. Xiao Qingzhong strongly supported his wife's efforts to engage in technical innovation. Every day, after work, the couple studied and pondered together, and finally designed a mixing machine that automated and continuousized chalk production. According to statistics from Hebei District, there were more than 600 technical innovation projects like this, such as improved drills, mixing machines, and motors, achieved through mutual assistance between husband and wife and help from relatives.

The growth of the Guangyao Branch's spring factory in the Gansu Road People's Commune also demonstrates the growth of new types of family relationships. This factory was originally established from scratch in 1958 by housewives Yi Xiangchun and Bi Yuqin. Yi Xiangchun learned the technology of making small circuit breaker springs for automobiles in a street production group, and when she returned, she discussed it with her neighbor Bi Yuqin and organized to start spring production. Bi Yuqin's husband, Miao Hualun, was a lathe operator at the No. 2 Auto Parts Factory in Hexi District. After learning of this news, he helped his wife design tools for producing springs. The "factory" gradually developed, expanding from two people to five people. Although the scale was small, there had to be accounting. Yi Xiangchun's husband was an accountant at the Dongchang Rubber Factory, and he helped the "factory" establish various account books and taught Yi Xiangchun how to keep accounts. Zhang Zhiqiu, a worker in this factory, is also a very typical example. Her husband, Liu Kaien, is a worker at the Dongchang Rubber Factory and is very busy with production every day; while she herself stays at home with three children, and her sister-in-law, Liu Jinghua, is also idle at home. After eating, the two sisters-in-law would "chat idly," either envying this family for dressing well or discussing that family for wearing nice things. Since Zhang Zhiqiu sent her child to the commune's nursery and entered the spring factory herself, and Liu Jinghua also became a textile worker, the relationship between the family members has changed greatly. When they talk, it is no longer about household chores or comparing clothing; instead, the couple studies technology together, and the sisters-in-law learn culture. With her husband's help, Zhang Zhiqiu improved the dies on the electric spring machine for making carbon-gold springs for generators, doubling production efficiency. Last year, she was named an advanced producer in the city. This year, on International Women's Day, she was also named a Red Banner Pacesetter for women in the city.

　　Communist Style

The collective, this huge melting pot, tempers people's thoughts. Here, communist moral values are beginning to become the criterion for handling the relationship between the individual and the collective, and between individuals.

In the Xushui Lake Street Commune's Bajiang Street, the following incident occurred: eighteen young women in the paper bag workshop, on a stormy night, unexpectedly ran to the workshop in the rain to rescue commune property. No one needed to say anything; everyone's feelings were the same. Some bailed water, some carried materials, and they covered the paper bags with their raincoats. When dawn broke, and the rain gradually stopped, these eighteen women, soaked to the skin, felt a little cold, but everyone's heart was warm and happy.

Examples of this kind of selfless devotion, prioritizing the public over the private, and helping others are countless among the people in the commune. Jia, known as an "anonymous hero" by the members of the Hongshunli Commune, was the first elderly woman to volunteer as a cook and start the first street public canteen in Tianjin. She has been diligent, conscientious, and has loved the commune like her own home, consistently. When she fell ill and recovered, the commune, out of consideration for her health, did not assign her specific work, but this elderly woman, who was happy to serve the masses and had fallen in love with the collective, still did not remain idle. She quietly did many things that people did not notice. Seeing that some of the commune's public belongings had nowhere to be placed and no one to take care of them, she vacated a room in her house to serve as a small warehouse for the commune. From pennants and gifts to kettles, bowls, and brooms, she carefully kept them all. Whenever it was mealtime and no one was in the commune office, she would quietly come in to answer the phone. Whenever the commune held meetings, she would bring boiling water from home pot by pot, no matter how people tried to dissuade her. When persuaded too much, Aunt Jia would mutter, "I can't just sit at home and not care about the commune."

In the nursery of the Dongfanghong Branch of the Gansu Road Commune, a story about "four mothers" is circulating. The story is like this: A little girl named Li Min in the nursery had a mother who suddenly fell seriously ill and was hospitalized last autumn, and there was no one at home to take care of the child. What to do? This child, who was only seven months old, was already very thin, and suddenly weaned off breast milk, she would not drink milk. At this time, the nanny Ge Shuping unhesitatingly used her own milk to feed the child, while weaning her own child and switching to thin porridge and milk. Sometimes Ge Shuping's milk was not enough, so the nanny Zhang Shuyun would hold her over and feed her with her own milk. When the child had dry stools, the elderly nanny Liu Miaofang immediately brought white sugar and sesame oil from home to make water, feeding the child three times a day. In this way, little Li Min was nourished day and night by the collective's milk and the collective's care. Little Li Min did not only have one mother, but "four mothers"! When Li Min's mother was discharged from the hospital, little Li Min, whom she had not seen for two months, had become white and fat.

　　Buried Wisdom Shines

"In the old society, women suffered, relying on their husbands and not being able to make decisions. The Party is our great benefactor, and the commune brings true happiness." This is a song of praise written by the members of the Xing'an Road People's Commune for the commune.

The establishment of the People's Commune has fundamentally changed the fate of so many people! How many ordinary housewives have become commune leaders, factory directors, workshop directors, red banner pacesetters, labor models, and advanced producers...? Last year alone, 397 people in the city were named advanced workers in the city. According to statistics from the Hongshunli, Xing'an Road, Guozhuangzi, and Gansu Road communes, there were more than 1,000 people holding positions ranging from commune leaders and factory directors to production group leaders, more than 1,200 people were named advanced producers and red banner pacesetters, and more than 50 women gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. They work enthusiastically with men in various labor positions to build socialism, using their hands, which were previously bound by trivial household chores, to produce precise products, produce thousands of products, and supply large factories and markets.

In the vigorously developing industry of this Xing'an Road People's Commune, there are 37 housewives serving as factory directors. Zhou Wenjuan is one of them. She is the director of the hardware factory. This factory was started by six housewives, six yuan, six brushes, and a door panel. Now, it has developed to 118 people, creating a wealth of 140,000 yuan in output value for the country every month. From a housewife to becoming the director of a factory with more than 100 workers, Zhou Wenjuan, like iron becoming steel, has been tempered through hardships. On May 20th last year, the first day she became the director of the hardware factory, the management personnel told her that the factory's production plan could not be completed, and it was three days behind schedule. At that time, the "Red May" competition was underway, and some people commented, "Now we'll see what the female director can do!" Zhou Wenjuan did not hesitate. She went to all the workshops in the factory to discuss with the workers, mobilize the masses, find the key problems, adjust the labor organization, solve the problem of wasted work, and start up the idle machines. Zhou Wenjuan worked alongside the workers in the workshop, participating in and leading production. As a result, she completed the plan ahead of schedule and won the "Red May" production competition banner in the district. Now, Zhou Wenjuan knows the situation of the factory like the back of her hand. She is familiar with and has mastered the technology of dozens of processes for manufacturing three kinds of products in the factory. In the technical revolution movement, she led the workers to vigorously engage in innovation, transforming manual operations into mechanization and semi-mechanization, making this factory a red banner unit in the commune, and Zhou Wenjuan became an advanced worker at the city level. Their deeds have been filmed and put on the screen.

Under Zhou Wenjuan's leadership, there are technical innovators like Zhao Shuxia, who can both use their brains and hands to transform machines; there are advanced workers like Feng Xinrong, the leader of the steel-cutting group, who dare to think and dare to act, are not afraid of difficulties, and are happy to help those who are lagging behind; there are people with communist style like Sui Yinfeng, who are selfless, put the public first and the private second, and use their time after work to help other groups complete their tasks. These people were all ordinary housewives in the past, and today, their wisdom and talents are shining in social labor.

    在城市人民公社的大家庭里
    ——天津几个城市人民公社见闻	本报驻天津记者
    从一年多前天津市成立了第一个鸿顺里人民公社开始，人民公社这面鲜红的大旗，就在人们心里生了根。这几天，天津市的大街小巷变得更加热闹，到处张贴着庆祝成立公社的大红喜字，老大娘们穿着新衣，欢欢喜喜地到“登记处”去申请加入人民公社。街道居民们千盼万盼的人民公社，一个接一个地成立起来了。
    我们访问了几个成立得较早的公社。这些公社成立一年多来，各方面都发生了深刻的变化。最使我们激动的、也是给我们留下最深刻印象的，除了那些千百个白手起家办起来的工厂、溢发着菜香肉味的公共食堂、整洁的托儿所、充满欢笑声的幼儿园、安静的敬老院、愿为社员办事的万能服务站、晚上灯火通明的公社业余学校以外，就是这里的人，千千万万普通的公社里的人。
      为了公社　为了集体
    郭庄子人民公社第四分社有两位老大娘，一个是五十四岁的李秀英，是分社的正社长，另一位是四十八岁的刘淑英，是副社长。她俩都是普通的朴实可亲的老大娘，但是在她们的身上，孕育着高尚的共产主义思想。早在1958年，她们两个人组织了几个家庭妇女，作包装、油漆粉刷活。那时候，什么也没有，五个妇女作油漆粉刷，只有几个小铁桶。她们风里来雨里去，起早贪晚，一个钱一个钱地积攒着。有了收入，就添工具、买原料、盖厂房，慢慢地油漆粉刷组发展成了电器厂，包装组成了包装厂，每月的产值由几十元，几千元到几万元。可是她们长久以来从没有想到过个人，不计报酬、无代价地为集体而奔波忙碌。
    像这样的风格高尚的人，在各个人民公社里数也数不清。鸿顺里人民公社光华分社3月里发生了这样一件事情：分社要在元福里建立一个食堂，刚宣布要三个人当炊事员，王淑兰就报了名，还把自己住的房子腾出两间来作食堂的厨房；在制帽生产组的刘素琴和五金加工组的师恩荣，原来两个人在生产组一个月工资都是四、五十元，听说要组织食堂，就主动报名来食堂作义务炊事员，坚决表示要不计报酬。老人家干起活来浑身是劲，每天从早忙到晚，挑完了水、买好菜后，就挨门挨户搜集社员们每天喜欢吃什么饭食，给孤老病残的社员送饭送水。工人吴秀琴生孩子，有一次师恩荣去送饭，吴秀琴说：“师大爷，你告诉食堂给我压碗面吃。”师恩荣当时就答应了，转过来一想：“月子人吃压的面太硬，不好消化。”他回到厨房就自己动手给作了一碗又软又烂的面，感动得吴秀琴不知该说什么才好。
      全新的关系　全新的人
    在公社的大家庭里，到处可看到共产主义的道德在成长，人与人之间的关系，被一个远大的理想联结在一起。
    过去，有些家庭妇女做完饭，就抱着孩子闲扯起来，东家长，西家短，再不然就是比吃比穿。现在可不同了，人们关心的是生产，是公社集体，是建设社会主义，眼界开阔得很。妻子和丈夫谈论的不再仅限于柴米油盐的家务琐事，主要的是谈生产、谈学习、谈技术革新。今年2月里，郭庄子人民公社第四分社划粉生产组开大会，动员群众，大搞技术革新。会后，生产组的张玉珍就回家和丈夫萧庆忠商量。萧庆忠一听妻子要搞技术革新，大力支持。每天，俩口子下了班就在一起研究琢磨，终于设计出一个使划粉生产自动连续化的捣料机。据河北区的统计，像这种通过夫妻互助、亲属相帮，改进的钻头、捣子机和马达等技术革新项目就有六百多件。
    从甘肃路人民公社光耀分社弹簧厂的成长过程中，也可以看出新型家庭关系的成长。这个厂原来是家庭妇女伊香春和毕玉琴在1958年赤手空拳办起来的。伊香春在一个街道生产组，学会了作汽车上用的断道器小弹簧的技术，回来她就和邻居毕玉琴商量，组织起来搞弹簧生产。毕玉琴的丈夫苗化论，是河西区汽车零件二厂的车工，他知道这一消息后，就帮助妻子设计生产弹簧的工具。“工厂”逐渐发展起来，由两个人扩大到五个人，虽说规模小，也总得有个账目。伊香春的丈夫是东昌橡胶厂的会计，他就帮助“工厂”建立了各种账簿，并且教会了伊香春记账。这个厂的工人张志秋也是个很典型的例子。她丈夫刘开恩，是东昌橡胶厂的工人，每天生产很忙；而她自己就在家守着三个孩子，小姑刘景华也在家里没事作。姑嫂俩吃完饭就“扯闲篇”，不是羡慕这家穿的好，就是谈论那家戴的好。从打张志秋把孩子送到公社托儿所，自己进了弹簧厂，刘景华也成了纺织工人后，这一家人的关系就大大变了样子。谈起话来，不再是家长里短，比穿比戴；而是夫妻钻研技术，姑嫂学习文化。张志秋在丈夫的帮助下，改进了制造发电机碳金簧的电动弹簧机上的胎具，把生产效率提高了一倍。去年，被评选为全市的先进生产者。今年“三八”妇女节，又被评选为全市妇女红旗手。
          共产主义风格
    集体，这座巨大的熔炉，陶冶着人的思想。在这里，共产主义的道德风尚，开始成为处理个人与集体、个人与个人关系的准绳。
    在蓄水池街公社靶鞝街曾经发生过这样一件事：纸袋车间的十八名青年妇女，在一次暴风骤雨的深夜里，竟不约而同地都冒雨跑到了车间，去抢救公社财产。谁也用不着说什么，大家的心情是一样的，淘水的淘水，搬材料的搬材料，把穿来的雨衣又盖到了纸袋上。当天露微明，雨逐渐停下来的时候，这十八个湿透了衣服的妇女，身上虽然觉得有些凉，但每个人的心里却都是热乎乎地高兴。
    像这种先公后私、先人后己、舍己为人的可歌可颂的事例，在公社里的人当中，那是说不清、道不完，遍处皆是。被鸿顺里公社的社员们公认为“无名英雄”的贾大娘，是第一个举手自愿担任炊事员，办起了天津市第一个街道公共食堂的老大娘。她勤勤恳恳、爱社如家始终如一日。当她患了一次病，病好以后，社里照顾她的身体没有分配她具体工作，这位乐于为群众服务、爱上了集体的老人家，仍旧一时不闲。她悄悄地作了许多为人们注意不到的事情。见到社里一些公用的东西没处放，也没专人保管，她就把自己的房子腾出一间来给社里作小仓库，从锦旗、礼品直到壶碗、扫帚，她都精心地保管着。每当吃饭，社办公室里没有人，她就悄悄地进来守着电话值班。遇到社里开会，她就从家里一壶一壶地给送开水，人们怎么劝也不行，劝得多了，贾大娘嘟囔着说：“叫我在家里坐着，不管社里事可不行。”
    在甘肃路公社东方红分社托儿所里，传颂着一件关于“四个妈妈”的故事。事情是这样的：托儿所里有个叫李敏的小女孩，她的母亲在去年秋天忽然患重病住了医院，家里没有人照顾孩子，这可怎么办呢？这个刚刚才七个来月的孩子，本来就很瘦，一下子断了奶，喂牛奶她又不喝。这时候，保育员葛淑萍就毫不犹豫地用自己的奶来喂这个孩子，而给自己的孩子断了奶，改喂稀粥和牛奶。葛淑萍的奶有时也不够，保育员张淑云就抱过来用自己的奶来喂。当这个孩子大便干燥的时候，保育员刘妙芳老大娘，就立即从家里拿来白糖和香油合成水，一天三顿喂给孩子吃。就这样，小李敏日日夜夜地被集体的乳汁、集体的关怀哺育着。小李敏不只有一个妈妈，而有“四个妈妈”！等到李敏的母亲出院以后，两个来月没看见的小李敏，已经变得又白又胖了。
      被埋没的智慧发出光彩
    “旧社会里妇女苦，依靠丈夫不作主，党是咱们大恩人，公社带来真幸福”。这是兴安路人民公社社员们为公社写的一首赞歌。
    人民公社的成立，使多少人的命运发生了根本的变化！有多少普通的家庭妇女，成了社长、厂长、车间主任、红旗手、劳动模范和先进生产者……。去年一年，全市就有三百九十七人被评为全市的先进工作者。据鸿顺里、兴安路、郭庄子、甘肃路四个公社的统计，就有一千多人担任着从公社社长、厂长到生产组长的职务，有一千二百多人被评为先进生产者和红旗手，有五十多名妇女光荣地参加了中国共产党。她们在各个劳动岗位上和男人一起，为建设社会主义热情地劳动着，就是用她们过去被繁琐的家务劳动束缚着的双手，现在制出了精密的产品，制出了上千种产品，供应着大工厂和市场。
    就在这个兴安路人民公社蓬勃发展的工业里，有三十七个家庭妇女担任工厂的厂长。周文娟便是其中的一个。她是五金厂的厂长。这个厂是由六个家庭妇女、六块钱、六把刷子和一块门板办起来的。现在，已经发展到一百一十八人，每月给国家创造产值十四万元的财富。从一个家庭妇女到担任一百多人工厂的厂长，周文娟像由铁成钢一样，是经过千锤百炼，在困难中锻打出来的。她在去年5月20日到五金厂当厂长的第一天，管理人员就告诉她说：
  “厂里的生产计划完不成，差了三天活，赶不出来”的原因。当时正搞“红五月”竞赛，有人就议论说：“这回要看女厂长的本事了！”周文娟没犹豫，她到全厂各个车间去找工人商量，发动群众，找关键问题，调整劳动组织，解决窝工现象，把闲着的机器都开动起来。”周文娟在车间里跟工人们一道干，参加生产领导生产，结果提前完成了计划，夺得了全区“红五月”生产竞赛锦旗。现在，周文娟对工厂的情况了如指掌，全厂制造三种产品的几十种工序的技术，她都熟悉，都摸遍了。在技术革命运动中，她领导着职工大搞革新，把人力操作的工序变成了机械化、半机械化，使这个工厂成了公社的红旗单位，周文娟成了市级先进工作者。她们的事迹被拍成电影，上了银幕。
    在周文娟领导下，有像赵淑霞那样的技术革新者，既会动脑筋，又会动手改造机器；有像切铁组组长封新蓉那样敢想敢干，不怕困难，喜于帮助落后的先进工作者；有像随荫风那样舍己为人，先公后私，利用自己下班后的时间，帮助别的组完成任务的具有共产主义风格的人……。这些人过去都是普通的家庭妇女，今天，她们的智慧和才能在社会劳动中放出了光彩。
