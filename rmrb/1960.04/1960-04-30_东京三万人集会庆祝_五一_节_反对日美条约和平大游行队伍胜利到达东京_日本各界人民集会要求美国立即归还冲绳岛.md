Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 28th: A total of approximately 30,000 people held a celebration rally in Tokyo tonight on the eve of the "May Day" International Labor Day.

This rally was jointly convened by the Tokyo Metropolitan Council of Trade Unions, the Federation of Independent Unions, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Joint Struggle Conference for the Defense of Peace and Democracy.

Representatives from the Japan Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Federation of Independent Unions, and the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs all spoke at the rally. They unanimously called on rally participants to further expand the struggle against the Diet's ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Saburo Eda, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, said that the strength shown by the Japanese people in the past struggle against the "Security Treaty" has demonstrated that they can successfully collect 20 million signatures against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." He also said that if Nobusuke Kishi and his followers disregard the people's rising resistance, Japan will experience a situation like that in South Korea under the rule of Syngman Rhee.

Hakamada Satomi, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, strongly condemned at the meeting the behavior of the splitters who are splitting the labor movement and conspiring with the Kishi Nobusuke group to forcibly pass the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Iwai Ikuo, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said that Nobusuke Kishi and his group are the common enemies of the Japanese and Chinese people. He said that the Japanese people must work hard to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations.

Han Tok-su, Chairman of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, spoke to warm applause. He emphasized, "No reactionaries can resist the united resistance of the people. Let the people of Japan and Korea unite in our common struggle to drive American imperialism out of South Korea, Japan, and all other parts of Asia."

The rally also heard reports from participants in the peaceful march demanding the return of Okinawa and opposing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" who arrived in Tokyo today, as well as representatives of the Miike coal miners who are persisting in their strike. The participants expressed their support for their struggles with warm applause.

Afterwards, union members performed cultural programs.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 28th: The march of the Japanese people demanding the return of Okinawa Island and preventing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," after a ninety-six-day journey covering two thousand five hundred kilometers of mountains and rivers, today victoriously reached its destination—Tokyo.

As the marchers, singing "Return Okinawa to Japan," headed towards Hibiya Park, Tokyo citizens on both sides of the street applauded warmly to welcome them and support their struggle. The marchers departed from Kagoshima, at the southern tip of Japan, on January 29 this year. Along the way, the cumulative number of participants in the march reached several million.

Today is the eighth anniversary of the effective date of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, a one-sided treaty forced upon Japan by the United States. People from all walks of life in Japan held a "Central Rally for the Demand of the Return of Okinawa" in Hibiya Park.

Kashu Seikō, the leader of the marchers from Okinawa, emphasized in his speech at the rally that the marchers realized during the march that the Japanese people's desire to have Okinawa returned to Japan, to prohibit Japan's nuclear armament, and to oppose the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" is strong.

After explaining the details of the miserable lives of the Okinawan people, Kashu pointed out that Japan cannot be said to be an independent country when Okinawa's land and residents are shackled by the Americans. He said, "This tragic situation is the result of the San Francisco Treaty, which enslaved the Japanese people."

He warned that if the new "Security Treaty" is ratified, the entire Japan will inevitably be in the same tragic and embarrassing situation as Okinawa is currently in.

He emphasized, "If Okinawa is returned to Japan through the struggle of the Japanese people, it will not only help the welfare of the residents of Okinawa and the independence of Japan, but also help the peace of Asia and the world."

Representatives from the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs extended warm congratulations to the marchers.

Iwai Ikuo, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, pointed out that the U.S. occupation of Okinawa is an act of violating international law.

Iwai Ikuo emphasized that the U.S. occupation of Okinawa cannot withstand the resistance of the people for long.

The rally unanimously adopted a number of resolutions.

The resolution sent to the U.S. government demanded the immediate return of Okinawa to Japan and the cancellation of the "Nike" missile base on the island.

The resolution to the Japanese government demanded that the government immediately negotiate with the United States on issues such as the return of Okinawa to Japan and the abolition of the new "Security Treaty."

The JCP's "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper published an editorial yesterday, pointing out that the struggle to demand the return of Okinawa, in coordination with the struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," has developed into a struggle for Japan's independence and peace. Through this great march, this struggle has achieved a leap forward.

"Akahata" called on all party members and trade unions, patriotic and democratic forces, on the basis of the achievements of the great march, to strive for the further development of the struggle to demand the return of Okinawa.

    东京三万人集会庆祝“五一”节
    反对日美条约和平大游行队伍胜利到达东京
    日本各界人民集会要求美国立即归还冲绳岛
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：共约三万人今天晚上在东京举行“五一”国际劳动节前夕庆祝大会。
    这次大会是由东京都地方工会评议会、独立工会联合会、东京都维护和平与民主共同斗争会议联合召开的。
    日本社会党、共产党、日本工会总评议会、独立工会联合会、日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会的代表们都在大会上讲话。他们一致呼吁大会参加者进一步展开反对国会批准新日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    社会党书记长江田三郎说，日本人民在过去的反对“安全条约”斗争中所显示的力量已经表明，他们能够成功地征集两千万个反对批准新“安全条约”的签名。他还说，如果岸信介和他的追随者不顾人民的日益高涨的反抗，日本将会出现像在李承晚统治下的南朝鲜发生的那种情况。
    日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员袴田里见在会上强烈谴责分裂主义者分裂工人运动、并阴谋协同岸信介集团强行通过新日美“安全条约”的行为。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁说，岸信介和他的集团是日中两国人民的共同敌人。他说，日本人民必须努力打开日中关系的僵局。
    旅日朝鲜人总联合会议长韩德铢在热烈的掌声中上台讲话。他强调说，“没有任何反动派能够抵抗人民的联合反抗。让我们日朝两国人民在我们的共同斗争中团结起来，把美帝国主义从南朝鲜、日本和亚洲的所有其他地方赶出去”。
    大会还听取了今天到达东京的要求归还冲绳、反对批准新“安全条约”和平大游行参加者以及正在坚持罢工的三池煤矿工人代表的报告。与会者以热烈的掌声表示支持他们的斗争。
    随后，工会会员演出了文娱节目。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本人民要求美国归还冲绳岛、阻止批准新“安全条约”大游行的队伍经过九十六天的行程，踏遍二千五百公里的山川，今天胜利到达目的地——东京。
    当游行的参加者高唱着“把冲绳归还日本”的歌曲走向日比谷公园时，街道两旁的东京市民热烈鼓掌表示欢迎他们并支持他们的斗争。游行者是在今年1月29日从日本南端的鹿儿岛出发的。沿途参加游行的人数累计达数百万人。
    今天是美国强迫日本签订的旧金山片面和约生效八周年的日子。日本各界人民在日比谷公园举行了“要求归还冲绳中央大会”。
    从冲绳来的游行者的领袖嘉数盛兴在大会上讲话时强调说，游行者在游行过程中认识到，日本人民要求把冲绳归还日本、禁止日本核武装和反对批准新“安全条约”的愿望是强烈的。
    嘉数在说明了冲绳人的生活的悲惨状况的细节以后指出，当冲绳的土地和居民受美国人桎梏的时候，不能说日本是独立的国家。他说，“这种悲惨的状况是使日本人民遭到奴役的旧金山条约的结果。”
    他警告说，如果批准新的“安全条约”，整个日本就一定会处于目前冲绳那种悲惨和狼狈的境地。
    他强调说，“如果通过日本人民的斗争把冲绳归还日本，那将不仅有助于冲绳居民的福利和日本的独立，而且有助于亚洲和世界和平。”
    向游行者致以热烈的祝贺的有社会党和共产党、日本工会总评议会和日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会的代表。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁指出，美国占领冲绳是破坏国际法的行为。
    安井郁强调说：美国对冲绳的占领也不能长期经得起人民的抵抗。
    大会一致通过了一些决议。
    送给美国政府的决议要求立即把冲绳归还日本，并取消岛上的“奈克”导弹基地。
    给日本政府的决议要求政府立即就把冲绳归还日本以及废除新“安全条约”等问题同美国进行谈判。
    日共“赤旗报”昨天发表社论指出，要求归还冲绳的斗争配合反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争发展为争取日本独立与和平的斗争。通过这一次大游行，这一斗争取得了飞跃发展。
    “赤旗报”号召全体党员和工会、爱国民主力量，在大游行成就的基础上，为进一步展开要求归还冲绳的斗争而奋斗。
