    Everyone Mobilizes, Seizing Every Opportunity, Mass Planting of Pumpkins
    Sichuan Prepares Ample Feed for the Large Number of Piglets About to be Born; Jiangxi's More Than Six Million People Launch a Pumpkin Planting Craze, Having Already Planted Over 600 Million Seedlings
    (By Our Newspaper) Under the battle cry of "A Great Leap Forward in Pumpkins for a Great Leap Forward in Pigs," Sichuan is seizing the current crucial season, fully utilizing all available idle land, and launching a mass movement climax of全民大种南瓜 (quán mín dà zhòng nánguā - all people mass planting of pumpkins), where everyone mobilizes and plants pumpkins everywhere. According to statistics from seven special districts (cities) including Mianyang, over 1.8 billion pumpkin seedlings have already been planted.
    Since February, Wusheng County has launched six consecutive shock campaigns to rush-plant pumpkins. The entire county has planted over 48 million pumpkin seedlings, averaging 500 seedlings per household. The early-planted pumpkins have already begun to sprout vines. In Yuechi County, the average number of pumpkin seedlings planted is 220 per pig. In some areas, the early-planted pumpkins have already emerged from the soil, and the seedlings are growing well, with strong stems and lush leaves, which is delightful.
    The全民大种南瓜 (quán mín dà zhòng nánguā - all people mass planting of pumpkins) is a strategic measure in Sichuan's high-speed development of pig farming to solve the problem of pig feed. Local experiences have proven that pumpkins are not only edible for humans but also an excellent pig feed. First, pumpkins are both concentrated feed, and pumpkin vines and leaves are excellent green feed, and they are also high-yielding feed. As long as they are planted and managed well, each pumpkin seedling can produce 50 to 60 catties to 100 catties, and some can even reach over 1,000 catties. Second, pumpkins are juicy, sweet, and pigs love to eat them, and they are easy to digest. They can be fed raw or cooked. Moreover, pigs fed with pumpkins grow fast and produce more oil. Third, pumpkins have strong adaptability and can be planted everywhere, in front of and behind houses, on the edges of fields, and in corners of land, without occupying cultivated land, and they are easy to cultivate, and everyone can plant them. Fourth, pumpkins contain rich proteins and carbohydrates and other nutrients most needed for pig growth and development. Fifth, pumpkins are easy to store and can be stored for one or two years without spoiling. Mass planting of pumpkins has become an important material foundation for the great development of pigs. This year, the province plans to increase the number of pigs raised by 50% compared to last year and strive to double it. In order to fully meet the feed required for the high-speed development of pigs and solve the contradiction between pig feed and grain farmland, especially since last winter, various localities have worked hard to breed pigs. A large number of piglets will be born between this summer and autumn, and planting pumpkins now is just in time for these newborn piglets to eat. Therefore, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee jointly issued a notice as early as January this year, emphasizing the great significance of全民大种南瓜 (quán mín dà zhòng nánguā - all people mass planting of pumpkins) for the development of pig farming, and requiring all localities to launch a全民性的大种南瓜运动 (quán mín xìng de dà zhòng nánguā yùndòng - mass pumpkin planting movement). Local and county party committees have successively held special meetings to make arrangements, first vigorously publicizing to the masses, explaining the profound significance of the fact that a great leap forward in pigs requires a great leap forward in pumpkins; with a great leap forward in pumpkins, a great leap forward in pigs can be promoted. Leaders at all levels have made plans and specifically assigned tasks to individuals.
    In the全民大种南瓜运动 (quán mín dà zhòng nánguā yùndòng - mass pumpkin planting movement), all localities have strengthened leadership and vigorously mobilized the masses, earnestly solving the specific problems of land, fertilizer, and seeds required for mass pumpkin planting. In Lezhi County, from the county to the commune and management area, a deputy secretary of the party committee was appointed to lead pumpkin production. All communes in the county formed land planning teams based on production teams, conducting planning mountain by mountain, slope by slope, ridge by ridge, and bend by bend. They adopted methods such as pumpkins up the mountains, pumpkins on the roofs, pumpkins on the sheds, and pumpkins on the trees, fully tapping the potential of the land and achieving "no tiles on the roofs, no branches on the trees, no water in the rivers and ponds, and green everywhere."
    In order to promote more pumpkin production, larger pumpkins, and high yields, all localities have paid close attention to implementing high-yield technologies during planting, strictly emphasizing planting quality. Generally, the masses are first mobilized, and after discussion and research, high-standard planting technical specifications are formulated in accordance with local conditions, and evaluation, inspection, and acceptance are strengthened, generally achieving large nests, loose soil, and sufficient base fertilizer.
    After planting, all localities immediately strengthened management. Many places have studied and formulated management systems such as timely topdressing, irrigation, pest control, and vine suppression, and have carried out evaluation competitions. Wusheng County's people's communes have generally implemented the method of specialized management and "three guarantees" (guarantee survival, guarantee the number of nests, guarantee yield), and "one reward" (reward for exceeding the quota) to strengthen management and ensure that all seedlings are complete, strong, and survive.

    (By Our Newspaper) More than six million people in various parts of Jiangxi Province have launched a mass pumpkin planting movement. Up to now, the province has planted more than 600 million pumpkin seedlings, averaging 34 seedlings per person.
    Pumpkin is a high-yielding crop, generally yielding 50 to 100 catties per seedling, and over 10,000 catties per mu. Calculating one mu producing 10,000 catties, and every five catties of pumpkin equivalent to one catty of rice, the yield of planting one mu of pumpkin is equivalent to 2,000 catties of rice. Pumpkins have a wide range of uses. In addition to replacing grain, they are also nutritious vegetables and an important raw material for light industries such as sugar making, brewing, and oil extraction, especially good feed for pigs. Pumpkins are very adaptable, drought-resistant, flood-resistant, and not picky about soil. Barren mountains, pond sides, and roadsides can all be planted.
    Jiangxi Province's mass pumpkin planting movement began in early March. Currently, this movement has swept across the province. People's commune members, government cadres, workers, students, and street residents are all mobilized under the battle cry of "The whole party mobilizes, the whole people act, seizing every opportunity, planting wherever there is space, mass planting of special pumpkins," planting pumpkins on barren mountains and ridges. In mountainous areas, people have planted pumpkins on many barren mountains, wastelands, tea plantations, and forests, forming large pumpkin mountains, pumpkin ridges, and pumpkin slopes. In plain areas, people are using field corners, in front of and behind houses, by ponds, and roadsides to plant special pumpkins. In cities, people have also planted pumpkins on scattered pieces of land.
    Now, on the basis of the tremendous achievements already made in the mass pumpkin planting movement, the people of the province are seizing the favorable opportunity just after Qingming Festival, rushing to plant while strengthening management work.
    Under the requirement of "every seedling is managed by someone, and every seedling is well managed," counties, communes, brigades, and production teams have generally established "pumpkin management committees" and appointed special personnel to be responsible for management. (Attached picture)

    人人动手　见缝插针　大种南瓜
    四川为即将下生的大批仔猪准备充足的饲料  江西六百多万人掀起种瓜热潮已种六亿多窝
    本报讯　四川各地在“南瓜大跃进，才有猪的大跃进”的战斗口号下，抓紧当前关键季节，充分利用一切闲散土地，掀起人人动手，处处种瓜的全民大种南瓜的群众运动高潮。据绵阳等七个专区（市）的统计，已种南瓜十八亿多窝。
    武胜县从2月份以来，全县经过连续开展六次抢种南瓜的突击运动，全县已种南瓜四千八百多万窝，平均每户达五百窝，早种的南瓜，已开始爬藤。岳池县已种的南瓜平均每头猪已有二百二十窝。部分地区早种的南瓜已经出土，瓜苗生长良好，茎壮叶肥，令人喜爱。
    全民大种南瓜是四川高速度发展养猪事业中解决猪饲料的一项战略性措施。各地经验证明，南瓜不仅可以人吃，而且是一种很好的猪饲料。第一，南瓜既是精饲料，南瓜藤叶又是很好的青饲料，而且是高产饲料。只要种得好、管得好，每窝南瓜就能产五、六十斤到一百斤，高的可达千斤以上。第二，南瓜多汁、味甜，猪爱吃，容易消化，生喂熟喂都可以；而且用南瓜喂猪，长肉快、长油多。第三，南瓜的适应性强，屋前屋后，田边、地角，到处都可种植，不占耕地，而且容易栽培，人人都会种。第四，南瓜含有猪只生长发育最需要的丰富的蛋白质和醣类等营养成分。第五，南瓜易于保管，可以贮存一、二年不坏。大种南瓜就成为猪只大发展的重要物质基础。今年全省计划养猪头数要比去年增加50％，并力争翻一番。为了充分满足猪只高速度发展所需的饲料和解决猪饲料与粮食耕地之间的矛盾，特别是去冬以来，各地都狠抓了猪只配种工作，今年夏秋之间将有大量仔猪出生，目前种植南瓜，就正好赶上这批新生仔猪食用。因此，中共四川省委和四川省人委早在今年1月就联合发出通知，强调指出全民大种南瓜对发展养猪事业的重大意义，要求各地开展一个全民性的大种南瓜运动。各地、县委都先后召开专门会议进行部署，首先大张旗鼓地向群众宣传，说明要使猪只大跃进，南瓜必须大跃进；有了南瓜大跃进，就能促使猪只大跃进的深刻意义。各级领导层层作了规划，并将任务具体落实到人。
    在全民大种南瓜运动中，各地加强了领导，并大力发动群众，认真解决了大种南瓜所需的土地、肥料、种子等具体问题。乐至县从县到社和管理区都确定一个党委副书记领导南瓜生产。全县各个公社都以生产队为单位成立了土地规划小组，逐山、逐坡、逐埂、逐弯进行规划。并采取南瓜上山、南瓜上房、南瓜上棚、南瓜上树等作法，充分挖掘土地潜力，做到了“房上不见瓦，树上不见枝，河塘不见水，遍地满山青”。
    为了促使南瓜多结瓜，结大瓜，达到高产多收的目的，在播种中各地都十分注意贯彻高产技术，严格讲求播种质量。一般都首先发动群众，经过讨论研究，因地制宜地制订了高标准的播种技术规格，并加强评比检查和验收，普遍做到窝大、土松，底肥足。
    各地在播种以后，立即加强管理。许多地方都研究制订了适时追肥、灌水、治虫和压藤等管理制度，开展了评比竞赛。武胜县各人民公社普遍实行了专人管理和“三包”（包成活、包窝数、包产量），“一奖”（超额奖励）的办法，加强管理，保证苗全苗壮，株株成活。
    本报讯　江西省各地有六百多万人掀起了大种南瓜运动。到现在为止，全省已种南瓜六亿多兜，平均每人有瓜三十四兜。
    南瓜是一种高产作物，一般一兜能收五十斤到一百斤，一亩能收一万多斤。以一亩一万斤，每五斤南瓜折一斤稻谷计算，种一亩南瓜的收成就相当于二千斤稻谷。南瓜用途很广，除能代替粮食外，还是营养丰富的蔬菜，也是制糖、酿酒、榨油等轻工业的重要原料，特别是猪的好饲料。南瓜适应性很强，既耐旱，又耐涝，不择土壤，荒山、池旁、路边都可以栽种。
    江西省全民大种南瓜运动开始于3月上旬。目前，这一运动已席卷全省。人民公社社员、机关干部、工人、学生和街道居民，都在
  “全党动员，全民动手，见缝插针，见空就种，大种特种南瓜”的战斗口号下，一齐动员起来，在荒山野岭大种南瓜。在山区，人们在许多荒山、荒地、茶山上和树林里都种上了南瓜，形成了大片大片的南瓜山、南瓜岭、南瓜坡。在平原地区，人们利用田头地角、屋前屋后、池塘边、道路边大种特种南瓜。在城市里，人们也在零星土地上种了南瓜。
    现在，全省人民在大种南瓜运动已经取得巨大成绩的基础上，抓住清明刚过的有利时机，一面突击抢种，一面加强管理工作。
    各地在“兜兜有人管，兜兜管得好”的要求下，县、公社、大队、生产队都普遍成立了“南瓜管理委员会”，并指定了专人负责管理。（附图片）
