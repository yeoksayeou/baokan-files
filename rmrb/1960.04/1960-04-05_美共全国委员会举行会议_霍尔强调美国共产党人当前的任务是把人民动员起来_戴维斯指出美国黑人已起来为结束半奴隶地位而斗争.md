Xinhua News Agency, April 4th, New York Dispatch: According to a report in the American "Worker's Weekly" on April 3rd, the National Committee of the Communist Party USA held a meeting in Chicago last weekend, focusing primarily on the 1960 US presidential election and the struggles of American blacks.

This meeting was the first held since the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party USA elected the National Committee last December. From the sixty-two members, the meeting elected an eighteen-member National Executive Committee to guide the work during the National Committee's recess.

The meeting sent a letter of condolence to National Chairman Dennis, who suffered a heart attack on the eve of the meeting and was unable to attend. He had suffered a stroke last December and is currently preparing to enter the hospital for a thorough examination.

General Secretary Hall of the Communist Party USA delivered the main report at the meeting. When discussing the US election, he pointed out that the task of the Communists is: "To sharply expose current problems and help mobilize the people around these problems."

Hall said that the black struggle is "the most explosive issue in the American situation." He also talked about the constantly changing relationship between socialism and capitalism in the world situation and its significance for the struggle for peace.

The meeting heard two detailed reports analyzing the struggle of black people: National Secretary Davis's report on the student struggle in the South, and Black Commission Secretary Lightfoot's report on the development of the black movement in the North and West.

Davis said that the current struggle of black people against racial discrimination, especially the sit-in struggle of students in the South, reflects a "constitutional and moral crisis" occurring throughout the United States. Black people have risen to fight for "ending their semi-slave status." He said that although the victories achieved are small, they demonstrate that "victory can be won." However, achieving large-scale victories requires the full support of the labor movement, democratically-minded citizens, and black people outside the South. Davis proposed an action plan that included supporting the black movement in the South, opposing the US government's deceptive civil rights laws, defending black leaders under attack, and increasing activity to ensure that civil rights become an important issue in the election campaign.

Lightfoot reviewed the rising struggle of black people outside the South for "freedom now." He said that black people "are aware of their inherent strength."

Southern Affairs Secretary Jackson, on behalf of the National Committee, guaranteed that solidarity actions would be taken to support the movement of Africans in the Union of South Africa against racial discrimination and persecution.

The National Committee also heard reports from National Organizing Secretary Bart on party building, and from Flynn on defending the party. Flynn reviewed the persecution of party leaders and democrats by the US authorities, and she focused on the struggle to free Winston. Hall and Davis's reports, as well as a special report, also emphasized taking urgent action to secure Winston's freedom.

Bart reviewed the damage caused to the party organization by revisionists who had broken away from the party, and put forward plans for party building and development.

"Worker's Weekly" General Manager Winstock conducted a careful examination of the party's current work to expand the circulation of the "Worker's Weekly" and proposed plans to strengthen and improve the work.

At the end of the meeting, Hall once again emphasized that "tremendous changes" are taking place domestically.

He said that the improved atmosphere of the National Committee meeting "reflects the new upsurge among the masses." "American political and social life is moving again. The stagnant years are over; the Communist Party must be vigilant" to adapt to the needs of the constantly changing situation.

    美共全国委员会举行会议
    霍尔强调美国共产党人当前的任务是把人民动员起来
    戴维斯指出美国黑人已起来为结束半奴隶地位而斗争
    新华社4日讯　纽约消息：据4月3日的美国“工人周报”报道，美国共产党全国委员会上周末在芝加哥举行会议，会议把主要的注意力集中在1960年美国总统选举和美国黑人斗争的问题上。
    这次会议是在去年12月美国共产党第十七次全国代表大会选出全国委员会以来举行的第一次会议。会议从六十二个委员中选举了一个由十八人组成的全国执行委员会，来指导全国委员会休会期间的工作。
    会议向全国主席丹尼斯发出了慰问信，丹尼斯在会议前夕患心脏病，不能出席。他在去年12月间曾患中风，目前正准备进医院进行仔细的检查。
    美国共产党总书记霍尔在会上作了主要报告。他在谈到美国大选时指出，共产党人的任务是：“尖锐揭示当前的问题，并围绕这些问题帮助把人民动员起来。”
    霍尔说：黑人斗争是“美国局势中最富于爆炸性的问题”。他还谈到，世界局势中社会主义和资本主义的不断变化的关系及其对争取和平的斗争的意义。
    会议听取了两个详细分析黑人的斗争的报告：全国书记戴维斯的关于南方学生斗争的报告，黑人委员会书记莱特富特关于北部和西部的黑人运动的发展的报告。
    戴维斯说，目前黑人反对种族歧视的斗争，特别是南部学生的静坐斗争反映了在美国全国发生的“宪法上和道德上的危机”。黑人已经起来为“结束他们的半奴隶地位”而斗争。他说：已经取得的胜利虽然小，但是这种胜利表明“胜利是可能赢得的”。但是要取得大规模的胜利，需要得到劳工运动、具有民主思想的公民和南方以外的黑人的全力支持。戴维斯提出了一项行动计划，其中包括支持南方的黑人运动，反对美国政府的骗人的民权法律，保卫受到攻击的黑人领袖，更多地进行活动来保证民权成为选举运动中的一个重要问题。
    莱特富特回顾了在南方以外的黑人争取“马上取得自由”的日益高涨的斗争。他说，黑人“意识到他们的内在的力量”。
    南方事务书记杰克逊代表全国委员会保证采取声援行动来支持南非联邦非洲人反对种族歧视和迫害的运动。
    全国委员会也听取了全国组织书记巴特关于党的建设的报告，弗林关于保卫党的问题的报告，弗林回顾了美国当局对党的领袖和民主人士的迫害，她着重谈了争取使温斯顿获得自由的斗争。霍尔和戴维斯的报告以及一项特别报告中也强调为争取温斯顿恢复自由采取紧急行动。
    巴特回顾了脱离党的修正主义分子在党的组织中造成的破坏，并且提出了关于党的建设和发展的计划。
    “工人周报”总经理温斯托克对党目前进行的扩大“工人周报”发行额的工作进行了认真的检查，提出了加强和改进工作的计划。
    在会议结束时，霍尔再次强调国内正在发生“巨大的变化”。
    他说，全国委员会会议的气氛的改善“反映了群众中间的新的高涨”。“美国的政治和社会生活又动了起来。停滞的年代已经过去；共产党必须警醒”，以适应不断发生变化的局势的需要。
