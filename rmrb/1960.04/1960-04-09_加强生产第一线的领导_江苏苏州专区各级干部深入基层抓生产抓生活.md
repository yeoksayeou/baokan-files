Strengthening Leadership at the Forefront of Production
Cadres at All Levels in Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu, Go Deep into Grassroots to Grasp Production and Life

(Reported by this newspaper) Since the beginning of spring, cadres at all levels in Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, have earnestly improved their work style, gone deep into the forefront of spring plowing and production, and generally achieved the following: frequent participation in labor, in-depth work, democratic work style, mass-oriented life, and institutionalized learning.

Since the beginning of spring, more than 500 cadres from the prefectural and county-level offices in Suzhou have been sent to the countryside to participate in labor training, more than 600 cadres have been sent to strengthen grassroots leadership, and more than 2,000 cadres have been organized to participate in the current general inspection of agricultural and sideline production. More than 200,000 rural grassroots cadres throughout the district generally participate in production and lead production. They work wherever they go, and they labor wherever they work; they labor wherever production is lagging behind. Many brigades in Kunshan County have implemented a system of half-day work, half-day labor, field office work, and rotation shifts. In the Zhouzhuang Township of Jiangyin County and the Leyu Township of Changshu County, 84 commune cadres have averaged 22 workdays per person in the past month or so; 693 brigade cadres have averaged 35 workdays per person. While participating in production, the vast number of cadres also carried out technical innovations, combining hard work with smart work, thereby more effectively promoting production. In order to adapt to the characteristic of dense wheat seedlings this year, the cadres of Zhouzhuang Commune in Jiangyin County created and promoted advanced tools such as wide and narrow dual-purpose hoes and fast fertilizer application buckets, so that field management can truly achieve topdressing like watering flowers, processing like embroidery, no weeds left, and even fertilizer application without harming or pressing the wheat. In seven communes, including Zhoushu, Chengnan, and Chengbei in Kunshan County, cadres participated in the improvement of 491 new-style tools, increasing average work efficiency by more than two times.

Cadres at all levels have adopted leadership methods of dividing lines and areas, assigning responsibilities, grasping the center, driving the overall situation, and following through to the end. They go deep into small teams, fields, and canteens to carry out their work, making their work more in-depth. Jiangyin County has generally promoted the "five packages, five grasps" leadership method. The "five packages" are: package ideological mobilization, package living arrangements, package production quality, package completion of tasks, and package implementation of policies; the "five grasps" are: grasp pacesetters to summarize experience, grasp the backward to catch up, grasp plans so that nothing is missed, grasp the key so that nothing is given up, and grasp measures to follow through to the end. Some communes in Kunshan County have moved their offices to the brigades, and the brigades have moved their offices to the fields. Six communes, including Shipai and Penglang, sent 30 commune cadres and more than 200 brigade cadres to strengthen the leadership of lagging production teams. These cadres worked with the masses during the day and helped formulate production plans and study and improve leadership methods at night. Now, these production teams have generally changed their backwardness. Cadres at all levels in the Suzhou area have developed the experience of grasping professional work in the past into grasping special topics. Since the beginning of this year, the Suzhou Prefectural Party Committee has successively held more than a dozen special meetings on double-cropping rice, cotton, aquatic products, sericulture, and pig raising, to ensure that they are followed through to the end and managed by specialists. This makes it easy to discover and promote advanced experiences in all aspects, and to discover and solve problems existing in the work in a timely manner.

Most cadres in the Suzhou area have achieved a democratic work style, are selfless, and consult with the masses in case of problems. Wang A'e, deputy secretary of the democratic brigade branch of the Diandong Commune in Kunshan County, found that the work efficiency was not high on the water conservancy construction site, so he convened a "Zhuge Liang" meeting to solicit opinions from the masses extensively, and led the masses to carry out tool reforms on a large scale, realizing the rail transport of soil, the hammerization of mud extraction, and the semi-mechanization of ramming, greatly improving work efficiency. Many communes in Changshu County have established a system of holding regular mass forums to listen to the opinions of the masses, improve their work, and greatly improve the relationship between cadres and the masses.

While deeply leading production, the vast number of rural cadres in Suzhou Prefecture also pay attention to arranging the lives of the masses, and achieve a mass-oriented life. A large number of cadres go deep into the canteens, and eat, live, work, study, and consult with the masses. All brigade cadres in Chengnan, Chengbei and other communes in Kunshan County eat in the canteens, lead the work of the canteens, and serve as cooks in the canteens for three days a month, to discover and solve problems in the management of the canteens in a timely manner, making the canteens more solid. The branch secretary of the Maota Brigade of the Shengze Commune in Wujiang County went deep into the canteen of the eighth production team to serve as a cook, helping the canteen to grow vegetable plots and diversify the food, which not only ensured that the commune members were well-fed, but also saved a lot of food. The commune members generally called him "good housekeeper," "confidant," and "good cadre of the Party."

Now, the vast number of grassroots cadres have a more urgent need for learning, and many places have established and improved the learning system. The Zhouzhuang Commune in Jiangyin County has insisted on Party lessons for five years. Now, it has launched a theoretical study movement centered on Mao Zedong Thought and centered on branch education. They put forward the slogan of "study hard in busy times, study systematically in less busy times, study more when busier, and insist on studying all year round." In the past four months, they have studied issues such as the "General Line," "People's Commune," "Continuous Revolution Theory," "Fully Develop Subjective Initiative," and "The Relationship between Practice and Knowledge." The political awareness and theoretical level of the vast number of cadres and the masses have rapidly improved, and production enthusiasm has generally increased. Not long ago, some cadres saw that the wheat seedlings were growing vigorously and believed that the harvest was guaranteed, resulting in a slack mood. The commune Party committee organized cadres to study the "Continuous Revolution Theory," so that these cadres overcame the slack mood and generally applied a topdressing of jointing fertilizer to the wheat three times. Jiangyin, Wuxian and Suzhou City have established 3,412 study groups of Mao Zedong's works, and the number of people participating in the study has reached 40,562.

    加强生产第一线的领导
    江苏苏州专区各级干部深入基层抓生产抓生活
    本报讯　江苏省苏州专区各级干部切实改进工作作风，深入到春耕生产第一线，普遍做到劳动经常化、工作深入化、作风民主化、生活群众化、学习制度化。
    入春以来，苏州地县两级机关已下放五百多名机关干部到农村参加劳动锻炼，下放六百多名干部充实基层领导，还组织了两千多名干部参加了当前的农副业生产大检查。全区二十多万农村基层干部普遍参加生产，领导生产。他们工作到哪里，劳动到哪里；哪里生产落后，就在哪里劳动。昆山县不少大队，实行了半天工作，半天劳动，田头办公，轮流值班的制度。江阴县周庄、常熟县乐余等五个公社的八十四名公社干部，一个多月来，每人平均做了二十二个劳动日；六百九十三名大队干部，每人平均做了三十五个劳动日。广大干部在生产中还大搞技术革新，把苦干和巧干结合起来，从而更有效地推动了生产。江阴县周庄公社干部为了适应今年三麦苗密的特点，创造和推广了阔狭两用锄、快速施肥桶等先进工具，使田间管理真正做到追肥如浇花，加工如绣花，寸草不留，施肥均匀，不伤麦、不压麦。昆山县周墅、城北、城南等七个公社，由干部参加改进的各种新式工具达四百九十一件，平均工效提高二倍以上。
    各级干部都采取了分线划片，分工负责，抓住中心，带动全盘，一抓到底的领导方法，深入小队、田头、食堂进行工作，因而工作更加深入。江阴县普遍推广了“五包、五抓”的领导方法。五包是：包思想发动，包生活安排，包生产质量，包完成任务，包执行政策；五抓是：抓标兵总结经验，抓落后后来居上，抓计划一事不漏，抓关键一着不让，抓措施一抓到底。昆山县有些公社已搬到大队办公，大队搬到田头办公。石牌、蓬阆等六个公社派出三十个公社干部和二百多个大队干部加强落后生产队的领导，这些干部白天和群众一起劳动，晚上帮助制订生产计划，研究改进领导方法。现在，这些生产队已经普遍改变落后面貌。苏州地区各级干部把过去抓专业的经验发展为抓专题，今年以来，中共苏州地委已连续召开了双季稻、棉花、水产、蚕桑、生猪等十多个专题会议，做到一抓到底，专题专管。这样做，既便于发掘和推广各方面的先进经验，又能及时发现和解决工作中存在的问题。
    苏州地区大部分干部都做到了作风民主化，大公无私，遇事同群众商量。昆山县淀东公社民主大队支部副书记王阿娥在水利工地上发现工效不高，就召开“诸葛亮”会，广泛征求群众意见，并领导群众大搞工具改革，实现了运土轨道化，取泥铁锤化，打夯半机械化，大大提高了工效。常熟县许多公社订立了定期召开群众座谈会的制度，听取群众意见，改进了工作，大大改善了干部和群众的关系。
    苏州专区广大农村干部，在深入领导生产的同时，还注意安排好群众的生活，做到生活群众化。大批干部深入食堂，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同商量。昆山县城北、城南等公社全部大队干部都在食堂吃饭，领导食堂工作，并且每月到食堂当三天炊事员，及时发现和解决食堂管理工作上的问题，使食堂更加巩固。吴江县盛泽公社茅塔大队支部书记深入到第八生产小队的食堂当炊事员，帮助食堂种蔬菜地，做到饭菜多样化，不仅保证了社员吃得饱吃得好，还节约了大量粮食，社员普遍称他为“好当家”、“知心人”、“党的好干部”。
    现在，广大基层干部对于学习的要求更加迫切，不少地方建立与健全了学习制度。江阴县周庄公社五年来坚持了党课教育，现在，又开展了一个以毛泽东思想为纲、以支部教育为中心的学习理论运动，他们提出了“大忙突击学，小忙系统学，越忙越要学，常年坚持学”的口号，四个月来，学了“总路线”、“人民公社”、“不断革命论”、“充分发挥主观能动性”、“实践与认识的关系”等问题，广大干部和群众的政治觉悟和理论水平迅速提高，生产热情普遍高涨。不久前，部分干部看到麦苗生长旺盛，认为丰收有了把握，产生松劲情绪，公社党委组织干部学习了“不断革命论”，使这些干部克服了松劲情绪，普遍加施了一次三麦拔节肥。江阴、吴县和苏州市已建立学习毛泽东著作的小组三千四百一十二个，参加学习的人数达四万零五百六十二人。（苏州地委通讯组）
