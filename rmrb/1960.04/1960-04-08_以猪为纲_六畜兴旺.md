Taking pigs as the key link, promote the prosperity of all livestock.

Chunhu People's Commune in Jiangxi Province has 26,738 pigs, an increase of 161% compared to 1958, with an average of 4.1 pigs per household, achieving one pig per person. In 1959, the commune's annual livestock income was 255,500 yuan, of which pig raising accounted for 68%.

Speech by Representative Chen Yike:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I firmly support the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I will report to the conference on the pig raising situation in the Chunhu People's Commune, Yongxiu County, Jiangxi Province:

In 1959, thanks to the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the high level of labor enthusiasm and wisdom displayed by the masses, we overcame two floods, two droughts, and pests and diseases with unwavering perseverance, and finally achieved a bumper harvest in agricultural production. The total grain output of the commune increased by 40.5% compared to 1958, cotton increased by 27.8%, oilseeds increased by 42.2%, and pig production, like other productions, also achieved vigorous development. Currently, the commune has 26,738 pigs, an increase of 161% compared to 1958, with an average of 4.1 pigs per household, achieving one pig per person. As of now, the commune has established 172 pig farms, including two run by the commune, 29 run by production brigades, and 141 run by canteens, with 16,172 pigs raised collectively, accounting for 60.5% of the total number. The development of various poultry has also been rapid, reaching 161,372, an increase of 122% compared to last year. Now, everywhere we can see an unprecedented prosperous scene of "pigs and cattle filling the pens, chickens and ducks forming flocks." Commune members say: The commune flower shines brightly, pigs and cattle fill the pens and the granaries are full, strong pigs and fertile fields produce high yields, more pigs mean more fertilizer and more grain, supporting the great leap forward in industry, and building a prosperous and strong motherland.

The great leap forward in pig production in our commune is a victory for the Party's general line of socialist construction. Because the masses, under the correct leadership of the Party, have mustered greater revolutionary enthusiasm, and implemented the principle of "collective raising as the main, with collective and private raising running parallel," pig production has been able to develop at a high speed in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical.

The great development of pig production has brought great benefits to the state, the commune, and individual members. According to the principle of overall consideration, prioritizing the state before ourselves, and prioritizing the external before the internal, the commune has provided a large amount of meat food to the state, overfulfilling the task of transferring livestock and poultry. Last December, 4,161 fattened pigs were transferred, double the amount in the same period in 1958; 20,936 various poultry, and other non-staple foods such as fresh fish, fresh eggs, and vegetables are continuously sold in large quantities. Before the 1959 National Day, a red flag train of twenty-two carriages was organized, fully loaded with fattened pigs, cattle, chickens, ducks, geese, etc., and transported to the heroic city of our motherland – Nanchang. At the same time, 5,729 piglets and 380 sows were sold to other fraternal communes, effectively helping the development of pig raising.

In 1959, the commune's annual livestock income reached 255,572 yuan, of which pig raising income accounted for 68%. A total of 3,910 fattened pigs were consumed by the commune members themselves, with an average of 13 jin of pork per person. The members said: There are many benefits to raising pigs, selling them for money, eating meat, strongly supporting national construction, accumulating fertilizer to increase production, and promoting a great leap forward in agricultural production.

The high-speed development of pig production in our commune is mainly due to strengthening the Party's leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, launching a mass movement, correctly implementing the policy of vigorously developing pig production, giving full play to the great superiority of the people's commune "larger in size and having a higher degree of public ownership," and implementing three-level farm management and four-level pig raising. Specifically, there are the following points of experience:

Adhere to Putting Politics in Command and Launching a Mass Movement

1.  Adhering to putting politics in command and launching a mass movement is the fundamental guarantee for the high-speed development of pig production. From the commune to the production team, pig production leading groups have been established at all levels, with the secretary personally taking command, and a deputy secretary specifically responsible for leading pig production. In the process of vigorously developing pig production, the commune Party committee constantly struggled against various right-leaning conservative ideas. Initially, when the Party committee proposed vigorously developing pig raising, some people said that there were few pig sources and insufficient feed, so it was better not to raise them. Based on the above ideological problems, the commune Party committee successively convened several cadre meetings and mass meetings, and conducted several special debates on the issue of pig raising. Such as: Should we develop pig raising at a high speed? Can we develop collective pig raising? How to develop pig production? By presenting facts, reasoning, calculating in detail, and comparing advanced examples, the reasons for the past deaths of pigs and losses in pig raising were found. After the debate, everyone put forward many solutions to the problems of pig sources, funds, and feed, thereby eliminating conservative ideas, boosting enthusiasm, and setting off a high tide in pig production. At the same time, the commune Party committee also timely summarized the experience, promoted it comprehensively, so that advanced models could blossom and bear fruit throughout the commune. The commune also stipulated that all cadres should actively take the lead in vigorously developing pig raising "experimental fields," delve into key points, cultivate typical examples, establish pacesetters, promote all aspects; implement unified leadership, unified research, unified deployment, unified inspection, and timely solve problems.

2.  The reason why pig production in our commune has been able to develop at a high speed is mainly because we have correctly implemented the policy of "collective raising as the main, with collective and private raising running parallel." Under the unified leadership of the commune Party committee, we have vigorously developed three-level farm management by communes, production brigades, and teams, and four-level pig raising by communes, production brigades, canteens, and members. In order to facilitate production and overcome blindness in production, specific divisions of labor were made for pig raising at all levels: the commune mainly focused on breeding piglets, supplemented by fattening, supporting private raising, and solving the shortage of piglets; production brigades focused on both breeding piglets and fattening; canteens and members mainly raised fattened pigs. In terms of development steps, we first vigorously developed sows, with pig farms established in every team.

The Party organizations at all levels also gave great assistance to private pig raising in the development of collective pig raising. If members do not have piglets, the pig farms will help solve the problem; if members are temporarily short of money, contracts are signed and advance purchase deposits are paid, or repayment is made in installments. In addition, the commune and brigades also provide necessary care in the allocation of feed and the arrangement of labor.

Do Everything Possible to Overcome the "Five Barriers" of Pig Raising

3.  Rely on our own efforts, adapt to local conditions, make use of whatever is available, eliminate superstition, think of all possible ways, make the greatest efforts, and do everything possible to overcome the five barriers of pig sources, feed, infrastructure, management, and disease prevention.

The first is the pig source barrier. We rely on the masses, self-breed and self-produce, rely on our own efforts, and vigorously develop sows. We adopt the method of "keeping every sow, keeping first and then selecting," and have now cultivated more than 3,000 sows. In order to further improve the mating work, we adopt early mating and early pregnancy, to ensure that sows produce five litters in two years, and actively promote technical measures such as double mating, re-mating, and artificial insemination, so that sows produce more and faster; among 30 to 40 sows, one breeding boar is kept.

The second is the feed barrier. In addition to timely allocating feed for pig farms and members to raise pigs, in solving the problem of insufficient feed, we mainly rely on the masses to obtain materials locally, vigorously develop wild feed and green feed for feeding, through four methods of "digging, collecting, planting, and utilizing." "Digging" means digging wild lotus roots, kudzu vines, etc.; "collecting" means collecting water chestnut vines, reed roots, daylily, etc.; "planting" means planting vegetables in front of and behind houses, beside gardens and corners of land, and planting revolutionary grass, water hyacinth, water lettuce, etc. in the water; "utilizing" means using agricultural by-products as feed, such as rape stalks, sweet potato vines, sesame leaves, etc. as silage. After the above four methods were promoted throughout the commune, the green and coarse feed was solved.

The third is the infrastructure barrier. With the great development of pig production, for the basic construction of pig farms, adhering to the principles of adapting to local conditions, making use of whatever is available, relying on our own efforts, obtaining materials locally, and building farms diligently and frugally, we made full use of waste materials and dilapidated houses to build pig farms. The commune pig farm dug pits in the empty land, and used reeds and dry miscellaneous wood to build pig pens. This kind of pig pen is warm in winter and cool in summer, which saves funds, facilitates management, facilitates fertilizer accumulation, and also meets the needs of the great development of pig production.

The fourth is the management barrier. We adopted the method of dividing professional pig raising teams, and selected a group of activists with certain pig raising experience according to needs and possibilities, and fixed them as breeders. In management, we adopted methods such as separating large pigs from small pigs, and keeping males and females separate. We must strengthen ideological and political education for breeders, establish a set of systems, and adopt the seven-fixing method of "fixing people, fixing time, fixing quality, fixing quantity, fixing tasks, fixing feed, and fixing rewards and punishments." And make the pig raising personnel use full-time, and do not transfer them in general circumstances. With the development of pig raising, we vigorously carry out tool reform, and actively trial-produce local, foreign, large, and small tools. If successful, we will promote them, and gradually realize the three modernizations of pig raising: that is, water self-flow, feed crushing mechanization, and transportation vehiclization.

The fifth is the disease prevention barrier. With the great development of pig production, disease prevention work has become increasingly important. A slight oversight can cause a large number of deaths. Therefore, we actively implement the policy of "prevention is more important than cure" and earnestly do a good job in disease prevention. We strive to frequently pad grass, frequently change grass, frequently clean, carefully manage, carefully feed, and regularly carry out preventive injections to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases. In addition to doing a good job in mass feeding management, the commune has established a veterinary hospital, each production brigade has established a disease prevention team, and each pig farm is equipped with disease prevention personnel, thereby basically eliminating infectious diseases such as swine erysipelas and swine fever, and reducing pig deaths.

4.  In order to promote the development of pig production, within the scope of the commune, we launched a red flag competition of "four comparisons" between farms and farms, teams and teams, canteens and canteens, members and members, comparing fast development, comparing more raising, comparing high survival rate, and comparing good feeding management. Through inspection and evaluation, pig production was greatly promoted. The implementation of a system of inspection every ten days and evaluation every month greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the breeders and strengthened their sense of responsibility.

Although the pig production in our commune has achieved great results, it still cannot meet the growing needs of the country and the people's production and life. We must develop pig production with greater efforts and faster speed. We plan to develop 74,100 heads this year on the existing basis, an increase of 177% compared to last year. Among them, collective pig raising will reach 50,000 to 55,000 heads, accounting for 67.4% of the total number of pigs in the commune. To achieve this plan, calculated according to the total population of the commune, there will be 2.2 pigs per person, 11.7 pigs per household, and 1.1 pigs per mu of land. This is the urgent desire and demand of the broad masses of people and has become the actual action of every member. We are deeply convinced that under the correct leadership of the Party, under the brilliant illumination of the general line, and by further giving play to the great superiority of the people's commune, and firmly relying on the broad masses of people, we will certainly be able to complete and overfulfill this plan, and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960.

    以猪为纲　六畜兴旺
    江西淳湖人民公社全社养猪二万六千七百三十八头，比一九五八年增长百分之一百六十一，每户平均有猪四点一头，实现了每人一头猪。一九五九年全社全年畜牧业收入二十五万五千五百多元，其中养猪收入占百分之六十八。
    陈翊科代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我坚决拥护李富春、李先念副总理的报告和人大常委会的工作报告。现在我就江西省永修县淳湖人民公社的养猪情况，向大会作一汇报：
    我社1959年农业生产，由于在党和毛主席的英明领导下，广大群众发挥了高度的劳动热情和智慧，以坚强的毅力，战胜了两涝两旱和病虫害，终于取得了农业生产的大丰收。全公社粮食总产量比1958年增长40.5％，皮棉增长27.8％，油料增长42.2％，养猪生产和其他各项生产一样，也获得了蓬勃的发展。目前全社养猪达二万六千七百三十八头，比1958年增长161％，每户平均有猪四点一头，实现了每人一头猪。到现在止，全社建立养猪场一百七十二个，其中公社办的二个，生产大队办的二十九个，食堂办的一百四十一个，集体养猪一万六千一百七十二头，占总头数的60.5％；各种家禽也发展很快，到目前止，已发展到十六万一千三百七十二只，比去年增长122％。现在到处可以看到“猪牛满圈，鸡鸭成群”的空前兴旺的局面。社员说：公社花开放光芒，猪牛满圈谷满仓，猪壮田肥出高产，猪多肥多多打粮，支援工业大跃进，建设祖国富又强。
    我社养猪生产的大跃进，这是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利。由于广大群众在党的正确领导下，鼓足了更大的革命干劲，贯彻执行了“公养为主，公私并举”两条腿走路的方针，因此，养猪生产能够多快好省地高速度发展。
    由于养猪生产的大发展，给国家、公社、社员个人都带来了很大的好处。公社根据统筹兼顾、先国后己、先外后内的原则，为国家提供了大量的肉食品，超额地完成家畜、家禽上调任务。去年12月上调肥猪四千一百六十一头，比1958年同期增长一倍；各种家禽二万零九百三十六只，其他如鲜鱼、鲜蛋、蔬菜等副食品不断的大批的出售。1959年国庆节前夕，曾组织一列二十二节的红旗列车，满载肥猪、牛、鸡、鸭、鹅等，运往祖国英雄城——南昌。与此同时，并出售给其他兄弟公社仔猪五千七百二十九头，母猪三百八十头，有力地帮助养猪事业的发展。
    1959年全社全年畜牧业收入达二十五万五千五百七十二元，其中养猪收入占68％。全年
  自食肥猪三千九百一十头，每人平均吃猪肉十三斤。社员们说：养猪好处多得很，卖了钱，吃了肉，大力支援国家建设，还积了肥增了产，促进农业生产大跃进。
    我社养猪生产获得高速度发展，主要是由于加强了党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，正确贯彻执行了大量发展养猪生产的方针，充分发挥了人民公社“一大二公”的巨大优越性，实行了三级办场，四级养猪。具体说来，有如下几点体会：
    坚持政治挂帅大搞群众运动
    一、坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，是高速度发展生猪生产的根本保证。从公社到生产队，层层建立了养猪生产领导小组，书记亲自挂帅，并有一名副书记专门负责领导养猪生产。公社党委在大搞养猪生产过程中，经常不断向各种右倾保守思想作斗争。起初党委提出大搞养猪，有的人说猪源少，饲料不足，不养为佳。公社党委根据上述思想问题，先后召开了几次干部大会，群众大会，对养猪问题，进行了几次专题辩论。如要不要高速度发展养猪？能不能发展集体养猪？怎样发展生猪生产。通过摆事实、讲道理、算细账，以及先进事例的对比，找出了过去死猪、养猪亏本的原因。经过辩论，对猪源、资金、饲料等问题，大家提出了许多解决的办法，从而破除了保守思想，鼓足了干劲，掀起了养猪生产的高潮。同时，公社党委还及时总结了经验，推广全面，使先进榜样在全社开花结果。公社还规定所有干部积极带头大搞养猪“试验田”，深入重点，培养典型，树立标兵，推动全面；实行统一领导，统一研究，统一布置，统一检查，发现问题，及时解决。
    二、我社养猪生产所以能够高速度发展，主要是正确贯彻执行了“公养为主，公私并举”的两条腿走路的方针。在公社党委的统一领导下，大搞公社、生产大队和小队三级办场，公社、生产大队、食堂、社员等四级养猪。为了有利于生产，克服生产中的盲目性，对各级养猪作了具体分工：公社以繁殖仔猪为主，育肥为辅，扶助私养，解决仔猪的不足；生产大队以繁殖仔猪和育肥并重；食堂和社员主要是养肥猪。在发展的步骤上，首先大力发展母猪，队队建立养猪场。
    各级党的组织在发展集体养猪的事业中，对于私人养猪也给予了很大的帮助。社员没有小猪，养猪场给予帮助解决，社员手里一时缺钱，便签订合同，付以预购定金，或者分期偿还。此外，公社、大队在搭配饲料和安排劳动力方面，也给予必要的照顾。
    千方百计攻克养猪“五关”
    三、自力更生，因地制宜，因陋就简，破除迷信，想尽一切办法，尽最大的努力，千方百计的攻破猪源、饲料、基建、管理、防疫五关。
    首先是猪源关。我们依靠群众，自繁自产，自力更生，大力发展母猪。我们采取“见母就留，先留后选”的办法，现已培养母猪三千多头。为了进一步作好配种工作，采取早配、早怀，做到母猪两年生五胎，并积极推广双配、复配、人工授精等技术措施，使母猪产得多，产得快；三十至四十头母猪中，留种公猪一头。
    其次是饲料关。我们除及时拨给养猪场和社员养猪饲料以外，在解决饲料不足问题上，主要是依靠群众就地取材，大搞野生饲料和青饲料来喂养，通过“挖、采、种、利”四个办法。“挖”就是挖野藕、葛藤等；“采”就是采菱角藤、浪草根、黄花菜等；“种”就是在屋前屋后、园旁地角、开荒种菜，以及在水里种革命草、水浮莲、水葫芦等；“利”就是利用农作物的副产品作饲料，如油菜秆、薯藤、芝麻叶等作为青贮饲料。以上四个办法，在全社推广以后，青粗饲料得到了解决。
    第三是基建关。随着养猪生产的大发展，对于养猪场的基本建设，本着因地制宜，因陋就简，自力更生，就地取材，勤俭建场的原则，充分利用废料破屋建猪场。公社养猪场，就在空隙的土地挖上埚，用芦苇、干杂木建猪栏，这种猪栏是冬暖夏凉，既节省资金，又便于管理、便于积肥，也适应生猪生产大发展的需要。
    第四是管理关。采取划分养猪专业队的办法，根据需要与可能，挑选一批有一定养猪经验的积极分子，把他们固定下来做饲养员。在管理上，把大猪与小猪分栏，公母不合群等办法进行饲养。对饲养员要加强思想政治教育，建立一套制度，采取“定人、定时、定质、定量、定任务、定饲料、定奖惩”的七定办法。并把养猪人员做到专职使用，在一般情况下不要调动。随着养猪事业的发展，大搞工具改革，土的、洋的、大的、小的都在积极试制，成功了就推广，逐步实现养猪三化：即用水自流化，饲料粉碎机械化，运输车子化。
    第五是防疫关。随着养猪生产的大发展，防疫工作越来越显得重要，稍有疏忽，就引起大批死亡。因此，积极贯彻“防重于治”的方针，切实作好防疫工作。做到勤垫草、勤换草、勤打扫、精心管理、细心饲养，并经常进行预防注射，防止传染病的发生。除搞好群众性的饲养管理工作外，公社建立了兽医院，每个生产大队成立防疫小组，各养猪场配备有防疫员，从而基本上消灭了猪丹毒、猪瘟等传染病，减少了猪的死亡。
    四、为了促进养猪生产的发展，在公社范围内开展场与场，队与队，食堂与食堂，社员与社员之间的比发展快、比养得多、比成活率高、比饲养管理的好的“四比”红旗竞赛。通过检查评比，养猪生产大大推进一步。实行十天一检查，一月一评比的制度，大大鼓舞了饲养员的积极性，加强了他们的责任心。
    我社的养猪生产，虽然取得了很大成绩，但是，还不能满足国家和人民的生产和生活日益增长的需要，我们还必须以更大的干劲和更快的速度发展生猪生产。我们计划在现有的基础上，今年发展到七万四千一百头，比去年增长177％。其中集体养猪达到五万至五万五千头，占全社养猪头数的67.4％。实现这个计划，按全社人口计算，每人有猪达二点二头，每户达十一点七头，每亩田达一点一头猪。这是广大人民群众的迫切愿望和要求，并已经成为每个社员的实际行动。我们深信：在党的正确领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，进一步发挥人民公社的巨大优越性，坚决依靠广大群众，我们一定可以完成和超额完成这个计划，实现1960年更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
