Xinhua News Agency, April 10th: The Second Session of the Second National People's Congress held its last plenary discussion this afternoon. As of this afternoon, a total of 464 representatives and 50 observers had spoken at the conference. Chen Zhengren, Minister of Agricultural Machinery, said at today's meeting that a new situation of extraordinary leap forward is emerging in China's agricultural machinery industry. The great leap forward of the agricultural machinery industry, together with the surging torrent formed by the 500 million farmers engaged in the semi-mechanization movement of improving agricultural implements, will surely accelerate the great process of agricultural technological transformation. Chen Zhengren mentioned that in 1960, China's tractors will increase by 293% compared to 1959, combine harvesters by 60%, irrigation and drainage machinery by 40%, livestock machinery by 230%, and the capacity of small rural hydropower station generating equipment by 300% to 500%. Due to the substantial increase in mechanization and a large number of semi-mechanized products, this year will be equivalent to adding more than 30 million laborers to China's rural areas.

Chen Zhengren emphasized that to accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization in China, the fundamental key lies in resolutely implementing the Party's General Line and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, and the key lies in launching a mass movement. He said that the mass movement on the agricultural mechanization front is manifested on the one hand in the mass movement of over 500 million farmers improving agricultural tools and implements, which is the foundation for realizing agricultural mechanization in China; on the other hand, it is the mass movement within agricultural machinery industrial enterprises and scientific and technological research departments. These two movements are currently adopting the form of "factory-commune linking" to combine and promote each other. Chen Zhengren particularly pointed out the great significance of mobilizing over 500 million farmers to carry out the semi-mechanization movement of improving agricultural implements, and pointed out that the policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods, and the policy of walking on two legs of combining mechanization and semi-mechanization, is the only correct policy. He said that the agricultural mechanization movement is the personal undertaking of the entire people, especially the 500 million farmers. Relying on the efforts of the broad masses of workers and over 500 million farmers, we will surely be able to gradually accelerate the great task of agricultural technological transformation. Now, the great march to accelerate the realization of the magnificent goal of agricultural technological transformation in China has begun, and the new era of "farming without cows, lighting without oil, and no worries about drought or flood" that the broad masses of Chinese farmers have longed for for a long time is gradually approaching us.

Li Fanwu, Ren Zhongyi, Li Yanlu, and Liang Jun, representatives from Heilongjiang Province, said in a joint speech that Heilongjiang Province has been promoting agricultural mechanization since the pilot project began more than ten years ago. Now agricultural mechanization has a preliminary foundation, and the area of mechanized farming has reached more than 20%. They emphasized that the promotion of agricultural mechanization must launch a mass movement; it is necessary to organize relevant departments to cooperate and work together; it must be a combination of "machines, horses, and cattle," a combination of mechanization and improved agricultural implements, and a combination of large, medium, and small machines. Representatives such as Li Fanwu said that Heilongjiang Province has already formulated a plan to basically realize agricultural mechanization in the next five years, and the people of the province have full confidence in realizing this plan.

Wang Heshou, Minister of Metallurgical Industry, focused on explaining the great power and unlimited vitality of the "small foreign groups" of iron and steel that have developed in the Great Leap Forward. He pointed out that under the glorious illumination of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the banner of the "small foreign groups" of iron and steel is becoming more and more radiant, and its future is bright and unlimited.

Wang Heshou said that in order to continue to maintain the high speed of the leap forward and strive to catch up with and surpass Britain in steel production as soon as possible, in the future, while building large-scale backbone iron and steel enterprises, it is necessary to use greater efforts to develop medium-sized and small-sized enterprises in the iron and steel industry. In areas with fewer iron and steel enterprises, it is necessary to continue to mobilize the masses to rebuild a new batch of "small foreign groups" of iron and steel, and at the same time, systematically carry out technological transformation of the existing "small foreign group" enterprises. Wang Heshou said that large foreign enterprises have the advantages of large foreign enterprises, and "small foreign groups" have the advantages of "small foreign groups." Only by implementing the policy of walking on two legs can we gather the positive factors from all aspects and realize the great leap forward in socialist construction.

Li Dazhang, Governor of Sichuan Province, introduced the situation and experience of financial and trade work in Sichuan Province in his speech. He said that the call for a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production promoted the ideological emancipation of the financial and trade departments in Sichuan Province. Financial and trade workers walked out of their offices, participated in production, organized production, and tried every means to serve production; at the same time, they actively organized and participated in the economic life of urban and rural people. Since 1958, financial and trade departments at all levels have vigorously assisted in the establishment of rural public canteens. More than 98% of the 555,000 public canteens in the province have now been maintained and consolidated. Organizing people's economic life has not only accumulated relatively rich experience in rural areas, but also initially explored some ways forward in cities. Li Dazhang said that organizing people's economic life is not only necessary for the great leap forward in production and has positive economic significance, but also has great political significance.

Fang Fang, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, spoke on the theme of "The Motherland is the Backing of Overseas Chinese," saying that the issue of Overseas Chinese existing between China and Indonesia could have been resolved. If the Indonesian government could have the same sincere desire for friendship as our government, abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Conference spirit, and earnestly conduct friendly consultations, the negotiations between our two countries on the repatriation of Overseas Chinese should have made smooth progress, and the Overseas Chinese issue could have been resolved fairly and reasonably.

Fang Fang pointed out that recently, the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities launched by powerful groups in Indonesia have not stopped, and various facts hindering Overseas Chinese from returning to China continue to appear. He said that we hope this situation can be changed.

Fang Fang said that the motherland cares for overseas compatriots in every possible way. Overseas Chinese who suffer unwarranted discrimination and persecution abroad and want to return to the motherland are welcomed back. The motherland also welcomes all Overseas Chinese who encounter difficulties and are willing to return from all over the world to participate in socialist construction.

Representatives from Yunnan Province, including Dao Jingban, Zhaocunxin, Fu Yizhi, Li Kairong, Li Hecai, Li Guanghua, Gengjue, Luo Yuntong, Han Fuyou, Hu Zhonghua, Lei Chunguo, Xiong Kaiyou, Wei Yanjing, and Gong Shou, representatives of various ethnic groups, made a joint speech today. They said that the ethnic minority areas in the border areas of Yunnan Province, which were in various stages of development from primitive communes to early feudal society ten years ago, have now crossed one or even several stages of social development and entered a new historical stage of socialism, greatly changing the backwardness of the border areas. This is the victory of the Party's ethnic policy and the great victory of the three magic weapons. They cited a large number of facts to illustrate the great achievements made by the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas in the past ten years, especially in the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward. They emphasized that only the socialist road is the only bright road for all ethnic groups to completely get rid of poverty and backwardness and move towards common prosperity.

The representatives who spoke this afternoon also included: Meng Tai, Wang Chonglun, Li Tingshun, Yang Shutang, Jiang Nanxiang, Wang Guofan, Liang Jinshan, Sun Dehe, Li Jinxi, Ou Yuanfang, Zhang Shouyin, Liu Peishan, Zhang Baifa, Song Jiehan, Tian Fuda, Jin Han, Chen Shaokuan, Hong Shunli, Chu Yinghuang, Lou Erkang, Meng Qingyuan, Yang Junsheng, and Sa Benxin.

    陈正人、王鹤寿等在人大二次会议的大会上发言
    农业机械化必须大搞群众运动再建一批新的钢铁“小洋群”
    在这次会议的大会上共有四百六十四位代表和五十位列席人员发了言
    据新华社10日讯　第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议今天下午进行了最后一次大会讨论。到今天下午为止，在这次会议的大会上共有四百六十四位代表和五十位列席人员发了言。农业机械部部长陈正人在今天的会上说，当前我国的农业机械工业正出现一个特大跃进的新形势，农业机械工业的大跃进，同五亿农民大搞改良农具的半机械化运动所结成的汹涌洪流，必将加速实现农业技术改造的伟大进程。陈正人谈到，1960年我国的拖拉机将比1959年增长293％，联合收割机增长60％，排灌机械增长40％，畜牧机械增长230％，农村小型电站发电设备容量增长300％到500％。由于机械化和大量半机械化产品的大幅度增长，今年就将等于为我国农村增加三千万个以上的劳动力。
    陈正人强调说，要加速实现我国的农业机械化，根本关键在于坚决贯彻党的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，关键在于大搞群众运动。他说，农业机械化战线上的群众运动，一方面表现在五亿多农民改良农具工具的群众运动，这是实现我国农业机械化的基础；另一方面是农业机械工业企业内部和科学技术研究部门中的群众运动。这两个运动，现时正采取了“厂社挂钩”的形式，相互结合，相互促进。陈正人特别指出发动五亿多农民开展改良农具的半机械化运动的重大意义，指出洋土结合的方针，机械化和半机械化相结合的两条腿走路的方针，是唯一正确的方针。他说，农业机械化运动，是全体人民特别是五亿多农民自己的切身事业，依靠广大职工和五亿多农民的努力，我们一定能够逐步地加速实现农业技术改造的伟大任务。现在，为加速实现我国农业技术改造这个宏伟目标的大举进军已经开始，我国广大农民长期憧憬着的“耕田不用牛，点灯不用油，旱涝不用愁”的新时代，正在逐步向我们迫近了。
    来自黑龙江省的代表李范五、任仲夷、李延禄、梁军在联合发言中说，黑龙江省推行农业机械化从试点开始，已有十多年的历史，现在农业机械化已经有了初步的基础，机耕面积达到20％以上。他们强调推行农业机械化必须大搞群众运动；必须组织各有关部门分工合作，一齐动手；必须是“机马牛”相结合、机械化与改良农具相结合、大中小机器相结合。李范五等代表说，黑龙江省已经制订了在今后五年内基本上实现农业机械化的规划，全省人民有充分的信心实现这个规划。
    冶金工业部部长王鹤寿在发言中，着重说明了大跃进中发展起来的钢铁“小洋群”的巨大威力和无限生命力。他指出，在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，钢铁“小洋群”的旗帜愈来愈光采夺目，它的前途似锦，无可限量。
    王鹤寿说，为了继续保持跃进的高速度，争取尽快地在钢铁产量上赶上和超过英国，今后在建设大型骨干钢铁企业的同时，要以更大的力量来发展钢铁工业的中、小型企业，在钢铁企业较少的地区，要继续发动群众再建一批新的钢铁“小洋群”，同时要有步骤地对现有的“小洋群”企业进行技术改造。王鹤寿说，大洋企业有大洋企业的好处，“小洋群”有“小洋群”的好处，只有执行两条腿走路的方针，才能把各方面的积极因素汇集起来，实现社会主义建设的大跃进。
    四川省省长李大章在发言中，介绍了四川省财贸工作的情况和经验。他说，工农业生产大跃进的号角，促使了四川省财贸部门的思想解放，财贸工作人员走出了办公室，参加生产，组织生产，并千方百计地为生产服务；同时，积极组织和参与城乡人民的经济生活。1958年以来，各级财贸部门大力协助举办农村公共食堂，全省五十五万五千多个公共食堂中，现在98％以上都已坚持和巩固下来。组织人民经济生活不仅在农村已经积累了比较丰富的经验，而且在城市也初步摸索到了一些前进的途径。李大章说，组织人民经济生活不但为生产大跃进所必需，有积极的经济意义，同时也有重大的政治意义。
    华侨事务委员会副主任方方以“祖国是华侨的靠山”为题发言说，存在于中国印度尼西亚两国之间的华侨问题，本来是可以解决的问题。如果印度尼西亚政府能够和我国政府一样具有真诚的友好愿望，遵守和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神，认真进行友好协商，我们两国正在进行的有关遣返华侨回国的谈判，就应该得到顺利的进展，华侨问题也就能够得到公平合理的解决。
    方方指出，最近，印度尼西亚有势力集团所掀起的反华排华活动并没有停止，阻挠华侨回国的种种事实仍在继续出现。他说，我们希望这种情况能够改变。
    方方说，祖国对国外侨胞的关怀无微不至。侨胞在国外遭受无端的歧视和迫害，他们要回国，祖国欢迎他们回来。对于旅居在世界各地的所有遇到困难愿意回国的华侨，祖国也同样欢迎他们回来参加社会主义建设。
    来自云南省的刀京版、召存信、付一之、李开荣、李和才、李光华、更觉、罗运通、罕富有、胡忠华、雷春国、熊开友、魏崖景、龚绶等各民族的代表，今天作了联合发言。他们说，十年前处在原始公社到初期封建社会各个发展阶段的云南省边疆民族地区，现在已经越过了一个甚至几个社会发展阶段，迈入了社会主义的历史新阶段，极大的改变了边疆地区的落后面貌。这是党的民族政策的胜利，是三大法宝的伟大胜利。他们举出大量事实，说明边疆地区各族人民十年来特别是在两年连续大跃进中取得的巨大成就。他们强调说，只有社会主义道路才是各族人民彻底摆脱贫困落后、走向共同繁荣的唯一光明大道。
    今天下午发言的代表还有：孟泰、王崇伦、李廷顺、杨树棠、蒋南翔、王国藩、梁金山、孙德和、黎锦熙、欧远方、张寿荫、刘培善、张百发、宋洁涵、田富达、金瀚、陈绍宽、洪顺利、褚应璜、娄尔康、孟庆元、杨俊生、萨本炘。
