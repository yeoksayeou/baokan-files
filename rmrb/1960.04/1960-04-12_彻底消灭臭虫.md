Thoroughly Eliminate Bedbugs
Vice Minister of Health, Qian Xinzhong

Bedbugs, also known as "xiàn bì," also have different names such as bed lice, flat lice, wood lice, and "féng chóng."

From the perspective of the risk of spreading disease, bedbugs may not be as harmful as mosquitoes and flies; but from the perspective of biting people and sucking blood, disturbing sleep, hindering rest, and affecting health, the harm of bedbugs is not necessarily less than that of mosquitoes and flies.

Adult bedbugs are about two "fēn" long, with a flat and round body. They have a scent gland on their body, and the secretions of the scent gland have a special odor, which is how the name "bedbug" comes about.

In entomology, bedbugs belong to the genus *Cimex* of the family Cimicidae in the order Hemiptera. There are several types of bedbugs in this genus, among which two species feed on human blood: the common bedbug (*Cimex lectularius*) and the tropical bedbug (*Cimex hemipterus*). The two types of bedbugs only have slight differences in the structural morphology of the prothorax, and there is no difference in their living habits.

Because bedbugs have flat bodies, they can easily enter and exit very narrow gaps. Therefore, the gaps in walls, floors, tables, chairs, and beds, as well as the spaces behind wallpaper, are their lairs. They hide in these places during the day and come out to bite people and suck blood at night. When conditions are right, they sometimes dare to come out and bite people during the day. For example, people who put their bare arms on a table seam where bedbugs live are often attacked and have their blood sucked.

Bedbugs reproduce quickly. After developing into adults, they begin to lay eggs in three to four days, from one to a dozen at a time. Each female bedbug lays about one hundred to two hundred and fifty eggs in her lifetime, and sometimes even up to five hundred. At a suitable temperature, the nymphs hatch in six to ten days, and the nymphs molt five times to become adults. If blood is plentiful, this process can be completed in about seven weeks, so they can transmit four or five generations a year. In the warm climate of the south, they do not stop their activity in winter, and the number of generations transmitted is even greater.

Bedbugs have a strong resistance to starvation. Nymphs can live for seventy days without blood, and adults can go without food for six or seven months without dying. Although they are resistant to starvation, they are notoriously gluttonous when blood is available. The amount of blood they suck in one feeding may be much greater than their original weight when they are starved. In the old society, corrupt officials, unscrupulous merchants, and cunning people were often compared to bedbugs. From the characteristics of being greedy, bloodsucking, only caring about their own gluttony, and ignoring the suffering of others, this metaphor is indeed both apt and vivid.

Early on, some medical scientists suspected that bedbugs might be vectors of certain infectious diseases. Some people believed that relapsing fever and kala-azar might be related to them, but under natural conditions, these suspicions have never been confirmed. However, from the point of view that bedbugs can be infected with certain pathogens in experimental methods, it is not impossible for them to transmit diseases. Leaving aside the question of whether or not they transmit diseases, the damage they cause to human health just from biting people and sucking blood and disturbing sleep is considerable. Many people cannot rest well at night because they are bitten by bedbugs. Over time, on the one hand, it weakens the body's general resistance, making people susceptible to disease; on the other hand, because of lack of sleep, energy cannot be fully restored, which of course also reduces the efficiency of labor or study.

Bedbugs are animals that are distributed all over the world. It can be said that there are bedbugs wherever humans live. In China before liberation, from Heilongjiang in the north to Guangdong in the south, from the coast in the east to Xinjiang in the west, they were also found everywhere. Some mountainous areas that have always been known as cool resorts are said to have bedbugs due to the cool climate, even in the height of summer, there are no or very few mosquitoes and flies. In recent years, bedbugs have been reduced in various parts of China due to vigorous health campaigns. However, because of the above-mentioned harm, it is entirely necessary to list it as one of the "four pests" and intensify its elimination.

How to eliminate bedbugs? In previous years, there were indeed few simple and effective methods. A story was circulated in Beijing that a person who sold bedbug medicine once appeared in Tianqiao, one corner of money a packet, but the buyer had to take it home and open it, otherwise it would not work. Many people bought it, took it home and opened it, only to find that there was only a piece of paper inside, which read "Frequent cleaning prevents bites." Although this story may be fabricated, from this story we can see that people urgently need to eliminate bedbugs, but there is no simple and effective method.

Now it's different. We have many ways to eliminate bedbugs, and the most noteworthy method is to use DDT to kill them. Walls, floors, tables, chairs, beds, etc. can be sprayed with a 5% DDT preparation. For gaps that cannot be sprayed and may harbor bedbugs, a brush or toothbrush can be dipped in the medicine and applied along the gaps. This will not only eliminate adults and nymphs in one fell swoop, but also, due to the residual toxicity of DDT, the nymphs hatched from eggs that have not died will also be poisoned and die. Generally, after a thorough treatment of a house, bedbugs can be eradicated in most cases. The use of 0.5% BHC preparations is also effective. In addition, fumigation with toxic drugs and dripping pyrethrum oil or kerosene into the gaps are also effective. Boiling water and exposing furniture and bedding with bedbugs to the sun also have certain effects. Various localities can adopt different methods according to local conditions, but if conditions permit, DDT or BHC preparations are more effective and easier to operate and save effort.

Although bedbugs live deep in their lairs and rarely come out, they are, after all, indoor insects. Unlike mosquitoes and flies, they cannot fly, and their breeding sites are not as widespread as those of mosquitoes and flies. Therefore, we have every reason to believe that as long as everyone takes action, the day when we thoroughly eliminate bedbugs will definitely come earlier than the day when we eliminate the other three pests.

### 彻底消灭臭虫

    彻底消灭臭虫	卫生部副部长　钱信忠
    臭虫又叫荐螕，另外还有床虱、扁虱、木虱、蜰虫等不同的名称。
    从传播疾病的危险性上看，臭虫为害可能不如蚊蝇大；但从咬人吸血、扰人睡眠、妨碍休息以致影响健康的角度看，臭虫为害，却不一定比蚊蝇小。
    臭虫的成虫，大约有二分左右长，形体扁圆，身上有一种臭腺，臭腺的分泌物带有一种特殊的臭味，臭虫的名字，就是这样来的。
    在昆虫学上，臭虫是属于半翅目臭虫科臭虫属的昆虫，在这一属里的臭虫有好几种，其中嗜吸人血的有两种，即温带臭虫和热带臭虫。两种臭虫只是前胸的构造形态稍有不同，生活习性并没有什么区别。
    臭虫因为身体扁平，很窄的缝隙它们也能出入自如，所以墙壁、地板、桌椅、床榻的缝隙里，糊墙纸下面的空罅里，都是它们的老窝。白天在这些地方隐藏，夜晚出来咬人吸血。遇到适当的机会，条件合适，有时白天它们也敢出来咬人。例如人们把光着的胳臂靠在有臭虫寄居的桌缝上，就常常遭到它们的偷袭，让它们饱餐而去。
    臭虫的繁殖很快，在发育为成虫后，三四天就开始产卵从一枚到十几枚不定。每只雌臭虫一生大约要产卵一百到二百五十个，多的甚至可以到五百个。在适宜温度下经六到十天孵出稚虫，稚虫蜕皮五次成为成虫，如果血食不缺，这个过程大约有七个星期可以完成，所以它们一年可以传四五代，在南方气候温暖地区，冬季它们也不停止活动，传的代数还要多些。
    臭虫的耐饥力很强，稚虫得不到血食时，能活七十天，成虫可以饿六七个月不死。它们耐饥力强，但遇到有血可吸时，它们却是出名的“饭桶”，它们一次吸进的血液，可能比它原来饿成两层皮的体重还要重得多。在旧社会人们常把贪官污吏奸商猾贾比喻为臭虫，从贪婪成性、吸血成癖、只顾自己大吃特吃，不管他人痛苦等等特性上看，这个比喻确实是既贴切而又形象。
    很早就有些医学家怀疑臭虫可能是某些传染病的媒介昆虫，有人认为回归热、黑热病的传播，与它们可能有关，但是在自然条件之下，一直没有证实这些怀疑。但从用实验方法可以使臭虫感染某些病原体这一点来看，它们传播疾病并不是不可能的。撇开传病与否这一点不谈，单从咬人吸血，扰人睡眠这一点看，它们给人类健康所造成的损害也就很可观了。很多人因为夜间有臭虫咬，不能很好地休息，时间长了，一方面削弱了人体的一般抵抗力，使人容易感染疾病；一方面因为睡眠不足，精力不能完全恢复，当然也会降低劳动或学习的效率。
    臭虫是个遍布全球的动物，可以说有人类居住的地方就有臭虫。我国在解放前，北起黑龙江，南到广东，东起海边，西到新疆，也是到处有它的踪迹，某些一向被人称为清凉胜地的山区，由于气候凉爽，就是在盛暑之际，也没有蚊蝇或很少蚊蝇，可是据说有臭虫。这些年来，我国各地由于大力开展卫生运动，臭虫已经减少。但因为它有上述的害处，当前把它列为“四害”之一加紧灭除是完全必要的。
    怎样消灭臭虫呢？在前些年，的确简单有效的办法不多。在北京就流传着一个故事，据说在天桥曾出现过一个卖臭虫药的，一角钱一包，但是买主必须拿回家去再打开，否则就不灵了，很多人买了拿到家里打开一看，原来里面只有一张纸条，上面写了“勤拿不咬”四个字。这个故事虽然可能出于捏造，但从这个故事里我们可以看出，人们迫切需要消灭臭虫，可是又没有简便有效的办法。
    现在不同了，我们消灭臭虫的办法很多，特别值得推荐的办法是用滴滴涕来杀灭它。墙壁、地板、桌椅、床榻等等可以用5％的滴滴涕制剂喷洒，对于喷射不到而又可能有臭虫藏身的缝隙，可以用毛笔或牙刷醮药沿缝涂抹。这样不但能把成虫稚虫一举消灭，而且由于滴滴涕的余毒作用，就是没有死亡的虫卵以后孵出的稚虫也会中毒死去。一般房屋经过一次彻底处置以后，多半可以根绝臭虫。使用0.5％的六六六制剂，也很有效。另外，用毒药熏蒸，用除虫菊油剂或煤油滴注在缝隙里，效果也很好。用开水浇烫，把有臭虫的家具、褥垫等放在日光下曝晒，也有一定效果。各地可以根据当地条件采取各种不同的办法，不过如果有条件，还是滴滴涕或六六六制剂的效果好，操作也简便省事。
    臭虫虽然深居简出，但它究竟是个室内昆虫，不像蚊、蝇那样会飞，它的孳生地点也不像蚊蝇那样广泛，所以我们完全有理由相信，只要大家动起手来，彻底消灭臭虫的日子肯定会比消灭其他三害的日子更早到来。
