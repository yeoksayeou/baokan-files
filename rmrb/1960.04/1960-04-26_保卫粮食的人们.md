    The People Who Defend Grain
    "Grain" is a feature film depicting the story of the militia's armed struggle to protect wheat during the Anti-Japanese War. It truly and vividly embodies Chairman Mao's strategic thought of a people's war with the entire population armed.
    The film reflects the situation in 1943 in an area bordering an anti-Japanese base. As the golden wheat was about to ripen, everyone was worried that the wheat about to be eaten would be snatched away by the Japanese devils. Sure enough, the impatient Japanese devils, holding shiny bayonets, forced the farmers to harvest quickly. At this time, the village Party branch held an emergency meeting to study countermeasures, adopted methods, and resolved not to let the Japanese devils and puppet troops seize a single grain. On the one hand, they sent people to contact our army, and on the other hand, they delayed the grain delivery time and cleverly used the relationship between the Japanese devils and the puppet troops vying to grab the wheat, which caused a scene of Japanese devils fighting puppet troops and puppet troops fighting traitors. This bought time, and under the active deployment and command of our army, various village militia organizations carried out joint actions, cooperated with each other, supported each other, and cleverly used tricks to finally transport all the grain safely to the base area, without leaving a single grain for the enemy.
    The film tells us: how the people in the border areas, under the leadership of the Party, heroically and tenaciously fought against the enemy; how neat and majestic our militia队伍was; how they intelligently and bravely launched various struggles against the enemy, deceiving the enemy's eyes and preventing the enemy from seeing through. Our militia truly comes from the people and serves the people. It is the people's own armed force, protecting the safety of the people's lives and property, winning the victory in the wheat protection struggle, and ensuring the task of handing in public grain and supporting the front line. Despite the inferior weapons of the militia and the lack of ammunition and other difficulties, the people have a strong patriotic desire to defeat the Japanese devils. The widespread mobilization of the masses can defeat the enemy. The wheat protection struggle clearly illustrates the harmonious relationship between our army and the people, and demonstrates the strength of the militia to independently meet and defeat the enemy.
    "Grain" is a film rich in revolutionary traditional education. It is recommended that the vast number of militiamen should watch it in order to better inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the militia.

    保卫粮食的人们刘辑瑞
    “粮食”是一部描写抗日战争时期民兵武装护麦斗争的故事片，它真实而生动地体现了毛主席全民武装的人民战争的战略思想。
    影片是反映了1943年在某抗日根据地一个边缘区里，眼看着金黄的麦子就要成熟了，谁也担心吃到嘴边的麦子将会被鬼子抢去的，果不出料，迫不及待的鬼子，端着明晃晃的刺刀，逼着农民赶快收割。这时村党的支部召开了紧急会议，研究了对策，采取了办法，决议不让鬼子和伪军抢去一粒粮食，一面派人与我军取得联系，一面拖延送粮时间，并巧妙地利用鬼子和伪军互相争先抢夺麦子的关系，就引起了一场鬼子打伪军，伪军打汉奸的一场狗吠狗殴打。争取了时间，在我军积极部署指挥下，各村民兵组织了联合行动，互相配合，互相支援，巧施妙计，终于将全部粮食顺利安全地运往根据地了，没给敌人留下一粒粮食。
    影片告诉了我们：边区的人民在党的领导下，是如何英勇顽强地向敌人作着斗争，我们的民兵队伍是多么整齐雄壮，他们机智勇敢地对敌展开各种各样的斗争，瞒过了敌人的眼睛，使敌人没有识破。我们的民兵真正是来自于人民，服务于人民，是人民群众自己的武装，保护了人民生命财产的安全，取得了护麦斗争的胜利，保证了交公粮和支援前线的任务。尽管民兵武器低劣有缺少弹药等等困难，但人民有着强烈的打垮日本鬼子的爱国主义的要求，群众普遍的发动起来就能战胜敌人，通过护麦斗争非常明显地说明了我们军民关系的融洽，显示了民兵独立迎战战胜敌人的力量。
    “粮食”是一部富有革命传统教育的影片，建议广大民兵都应该去看，以便更好地继承和发扬民兵的光荣传统。
