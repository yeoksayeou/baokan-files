    Dacca International Industrial Fair Chinese Pavilion Closes
    Pakistani People Warmly Praise China's Achievements
    The Chinese Pavilion was the most popular exhibition hall at the fair; since its opening, it has received 750,000 visitors, some of whom have visited as many as twenty-five times. Tens of thousands of people warmly praised the Chinese Pavilion and the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction. Some visitors told the staff of the Chinese Pavilion after their visit that they no longer believed the Western countries' slanderous propaganda against China.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, April 3rd: The East Pakistan International Industrial Fair held in Dacca and the Chinese Exhibition Hall within the fair both closed on the afternoon of the 2nd.
    
    During the fifty-four days since its opening on February 9, the Chinese Exhibition Hall received a total of 750,000 visitors. The Chinese Culture and Construction Introduction Center within the fair has been visited by 200,000 people since it opened on January 31 (the opening date of the fair).
    
    Madani, Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the Fair, said at the closing ceremony of the Fair on the 2nd that the Chinese Exhibition Hall was the largest and most popular exhibition hall in the fair.
    
    During the opening of the exhibition hall, tens of thousands of people warmly praised the Chinese Pavilion and the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction. One visitor wrote, "The progress you have made is due to your continuous and patriotic labor. I am very happy to extend my best wishes to my Chinese brothers." Another visitor wrote: "China's progress in all aspects in such a short period of time has really opened the eyes of underdeveloped countries." Another visitor wrote: "The exhibits inspire the people of Pakistan to improve all aspects of modern life. They correctly show how rapid progress a country can make if it wishes."
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, April 4th: The people of Dacca, East Pakistan, bid farewell to their Chinese friends before the closing of the Chinese Pavilion at the Pakistan International Industrial Fair.
    
    In the last few days before the closing of the Chinese Pavilion, there were particularly many visitors to the Chinese Pavilion, with an average of about 50,000 people per day. Some people visited four or five times, and some even visited as many as twenty-five times. They came to the Chinese Pavilion again and again in the hot sun. Some visitors came only to shake hands with their Chinese friends. They gave photos of their families and other souvenirs to their Chinese friends, and some asked their Chinese friends to take pictures with them and leave addresses for future correspondence. After bidding farewell to their Chinese friends, two young students enthusiastically shouted "Long live the friendship between the Pakistani people and the Chinese people."
    
    The people who said goodbye always asked, "When will the Chinese Exhibition Group come again?" An old man said to the staff of the Chinese Exhibition Hall, "Don't close, let it stay here as a permanent memorial!" Others hoped that the Chinese delegation would hold an exhibition for the Pakistani people every year.
    
    Many visitors said in conversations with the staff of the Chinese Pavilion that the Chinese Pavilion was very beneficial to them. One visitor said after visiting the Chinese Pavilion that he had been deceived by the Western newspapers' deceptive publicity that all the people's communes in China had collapsed. After visiting the agricultural section in the Chinese Pavilion, he realized that the people's commune system was an extremely important system, so he wrote in the visitor's book, "I would like to repeat what Chairman Mao said: The people's commune is good!" Many visitors exposed the Western newspapers' slander that China implemented "forced labor." They said that these remarkable products could only be produced by truly free people. After the visit, two young female students told the staff of the Chinese Pavilion that they would no longer believe the Western countries' slanderous propaganda against China.

    达卡国际工业博览会中国馆闭幕
    巴基斯坦人民热烈赞扬我国成就
    中国馆是博览会中最受人欢迎的一个展览馆；从开幕以来共接待了七十五万观众，有些人甚至参观了二十五次之多。数以万计的人热烈赞扬中国馆和中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成就。有的观众在参观后向中国馆的工作人员表示，他们再不相信西方国家对中国的诽谤宣传了。
    新华社卡拉奇3日电　在达卡举行的东巴基斯坦国际工业博览会和博览会中的中国展览馆都在2日下午闭幕。
    中国展览馆从2月9日开幕以来的五十四天中，共接待了七十五万观众，博览会中的中国文化和建设介绍中心自从1月31日（博览会开幕日期）开放以来，共有二十万人前往参观。
    博览会顾问委员会主席马达尼2日在主持博览会闭幕仪式时说，中国展览馆是博览会中最大的、最受人欢迎的一个展览馆。
    在展览馆开放期间，数以万计的人热烈赞扬中国馆和中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成就。一位参观者写道，“你们所取得的进展应归功于你们持续不断的、爱国主义的劳动。我非常高兴地向我的中国兄弟致以最好的祝愿。”另一位参观者写道：“中国在短短的时间内在一切方面的进步实际上使不发达国家开了眼界”。还有位参观者写道：“展览品使巴基斯坦人民对于改善现代生活的各个方面有所鼓舞。它们正确地表明，如果一个国家希望的话，它可以取得多么迅速的进步。”
    新华社卡拉奇4日电　东巴基斯坦达卡的人民在巴基斯坦国际工业博览会中国馆闭幕前纷纷向他们的中国朋友们告别。
    在中国馆闭幕前的最后几天，中国馆的观众特别多，平均每天有五万人左右。有些人参观了四五次，还有一些人甚至参观了二十五次之多。他们在炎热的阳光下一次又一次地来到中国馆。有些观众来的目的只不过是同他们的中国朋友握一握手。他们把他们家属的照片和其它纪念品送给中国朋友，还有些人要求他们的中国朋友们同他们一起照像，留下地址以便将来通信。两个青年学生在对他们的中国朋友告别以后，热情洋溢地高呼“巴基斯坦人民和中国人民的友谊万岁”。
    告别的人总是问“中国展览团什么时候再来？”一位老人对中国展览馆工作人员说，“你们不要闭幕，让它留在这里作为永远的纪念吧！”还有人希望中国代表团每年为巴基斯坦人民举办一个展览会。
    许多观众在同中国馆工作人员谈话时说，中国馆对他们非常有益。一位观众在参观了中国馆后说，他受到西方报纸所谓中国所有的人民公社都垮台了的欺骗宣传。在参观了中国馆农业部分以后，他认识到，人民公社制度是极其重要的制度，因此他在留言簿上写道，“我愿意重复毛主席所说的话：人民公社好！”许多观众揭穿了西方报纸所谓中国实施“强迫劳动”的诬蔑。他们说，这些了不起的产品只有真正自由的人民才能生产。有两个年青的女学生在参观以后，对中国馆的工作人员说，她们将不再相信西方国家对中国的诽谤宣传。
