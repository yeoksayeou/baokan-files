At the beginning of the conference, we listened to the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian on behalf of the State Council, and yesterday we listened to the report made by Comrade Tan Zhenlin on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on striving to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. These reports allowed us to see the great achievements of the continued Great Leap Forward last year, and at the same time, we saw the grand plans for this year. This makes us confident that under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the leaping progress of socialist construction will continue to develop, and will leap forward better and better. The National Agricultural Development Program will certainly be realized ahead of schedule. We fully support these three reports and are determined to make better achievements in our own work to practically support them.

Since the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party, all professional music groups have gone to factories and the countryside, participating in labor, performing, and providing guidance. We have been educated by the workers, peasants, and soldiers and by production practices, and our performances have also encouraged production. The performance targets for workers, peasants, and soldiers are frequently broken again and again, and the artistic quality of many works and many performances has been significantly improved. The connection between professional musicians and the masses is closer than in the past, and the enthusiasm is getting higher and higher. Chairman Mao pointed out to us the broad road of going deep into life to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and combining artistic creation with productive labor. Through the practice of this period, it has become increasingly clear in everyone's mind. "Vow to Sing the Red Flag with a Red Heart" has become our common language.

However, in this era where "one day equals twenty years," our work is still not keeping up with the development of the situation. From the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, we see that with the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a massive high tide of cultural construction is coming. Real life is making higher demands on us: demanding that we write more and better works, reflect real life faster, more truthfully, and more powerfully, make more and better performances, and cultivate more and better music cadres. How can we meet the people's expectations of us?

　　The "Key Link" of Music Art
　　Is Our Thought

In industrial and agricultural production, we have already found the "key link" to promote all-round progress. In musical artistic creation, we believe that the "key link" is our thought. Musicians must arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism, establish a proletarian world view, and stand at the forefront of the times in order to create the newest and most beautiful musical art. However, there are still many non-proletarian thoughts in the minds of many musicians. Although we live in the boiling 1960s of the twentieth century, and the songs of the Great Leap Forward resonate in every city and every village, some people still harbor old-fashioned feelings and are immersed in nineteenth-century Western European love songs. At present, one of our serious tasks is to earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, especially his literary and artistic thoughts, and earnestly transform our world view. No destruction, no construction. We must thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, especially the blind faith in eighteenth and nineteenth-century Western European art. We must thoroughly criticize it from the viewpoint of historical materialism in order to eliminate it. We must carry out an irreconcilable struggle against modern revisionist thought in the literary and artistic field. Only by firmly establishing a proletarian world view can we unswervingly implement the class line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers; can we accomplish the political task of educating the people with communist ideology; can we accomplish the historical task of creating the newest and most beautiful music that expresses our era and our nation. "What era sings what songs, what class speaks what words." We must be spokespersons for the working class. Socialism and communism are the strongest voices of our era. We regard it as our glorious duty to publicize the most advanced socialist and communist ideas of mankind and to greet the spring of mankind—the advent of communist society—with songs.

This conference is being held in the midst of the upsurge of the mass movement of technological innovation. Many comrades have talked about technological innovation and technological revolution on the production front in their speeches, which has also inspired us to consider innovation and revolution in music work.

　　Mark the "Newness" of the Nation
　　Establish the "Difference" of the Class

Although the laws of artistic production and material production are not exactly the same, the spirit of breaking superstitions, liberating thought, daring to think and do, and daring to innovate must also be shared in literary and artistic labor, which is the same as on the production front. We do not think that the existing artistic expressions in music creation, singing, and performance are perfect. Although, generally speaking, there has been a great improvement, in order to reflect the colorful life and spiritual outlook of our people in a more expressive way, in order to "mark the newness of the nation and establish the difference of the class," and in order to make our music art shine in the world, it should be said that our current level of music art still needs to be improved. Many of our works have not been able to express the rich spiritual outlook and advanced thinking in people's lives, and we are not good at creatively using various foreign musical forms. How to perfectly combine the excellent traditions of our national music with modern musical techniques and modern musical forms to create a new socialist national musical art, that is, how to make foreign musical forms more nationalized and popularized, and become an art form that our people feel close to and love to see and hear; how to develop the inherent artistic styles of the nation, such as opera music and storytelling music, on the original basis, so that it is suitable for portraying new heroic figures. We are pleased to see that some young authors' works, such as "Youth Piano Concerto," "Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto," "Happiness River Chorus," and "Honghu Red Guards," were welcomed by the majority of the audience among the works dedicated to the National Day last year. The composers of the first three works are all young music academy students. They gained many new feelings in labor training and in living with the working people. They have mastered certain professional techniques but are not bound by rules and regulations. To a certain extent, they used the expressive techniques of folk music, but were also encouraged by the spirit of the Great Leap Forward and dared to bring forth new ideas. This achievement was also achieved under the leadership of the Party, the help of teachers, and the encouragement of classmates. These experiences have many things in common with technological innovation in factories. It inspires us to encourage everyone to use these experiences and boldly carry out creation in many ways.

　　We Must Give Music Art
　　To the Masses Themselves

Due to the rapid development of the situation, the existing music cadres are obviously not keeping up with the needs of the work in terms of quantity. In addition to training cadres by music colleges in various places, various music and dance groups, and even music research institutions, can also use all their strength and equipment to train reserve forces, just like factories running schools in a big way, and help communes and factories cultivate amateur music activity backbones. If music colleges and professional groups with conditions can attach short-term training courses for amateur music cadres of workers and peasants, this will be of great benefit to the development of worker-peasant music activities. In the case of a special shortage of teachers, on the one hand, we must continue to tap internal potential, and on the other hand, we can also mobilize non-detached folk artists to serve as short-term teachers, or students can visit to learn; in addition, we must also make full use of modern equipment such as: televisions, radios, records, etc. to hold various music lectures and teach singing, playing, and creation techniques. In short, the masses have an urgent need to carry out amateur music activities, and we must do everything possible to hand over music art to the masses themselves, so that music art can also bloom everywhere.

At the beginning of this decade of the 1960s, we look forward to the future with full confidence: Under the leadership of the Party, we will establish a team of music workers who are both red and expert and wholeheartedly serve the people. In the years of continued leap forward, we will blow the horn of marching towards communism, sing the praises of our General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, sing the praises of the heroic figures of our times, sing the praises of our beautiful new life, and encourage the people to advance on the broad road of socialism and communism. In the ranks of music workers, a large number of musical geniuses from worker, peasant, and soldier amateur cultural activities will emerge, the flowers of mass art will bloom all over the territory of New China, and our music art will also climb to the highest peak of world music art. Let us all work hard to realize this beautiful vision!

    誓以红心唱红旗
    马思聪吕　骥郎毓秀　查夷平周小燕　瞿希贤代表马　可　卫仲乐　杨荫浏金国富　贺绿汀　黄虹喻宜萱委员的联合发言
    在会议的开始，我们听了李富春、李先念二位副总理代表国务院向大会作的报告，昨天又听了谭震林同志代表中共中央和国务院作的为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告，使我们看到去年继续大跃进的巨大成就，同时又看到了今年的宏伟计划，使我们确信在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，社会主义建设的跃进局面必将持续发展下去，而且将跃进得愈来愈好。农业发展纲要一定能够提前实现。我们完全拥护这三个报告，并且决心在我们自己的工作岗位上做出更好的成绩来实际拥护这三个报告。
    自从大跃进以来，在党的领导下，所有的专业音乐团体下厂、下乡，一边参加劳动，一边演出，一边辅导。我们从工农群众和生产实践中得到了教育，我们的演出也鼓舞了生产。为工农兵演出的场次指标经常被一再突破，许多作品和许多演出的艺术质量有了显著的提高。专业音乐工作者和群众的联系比过去更密切了，干劲也越来越大了。毛主席为我们指出深入生活为工农兵服务，艺术创造与生产劳动相结合这条宽广的道路，通过这段时间的实践，在大家的心目中愈来愈明确了。“誓以红心唱红旗”已成为我们的共同语言。
    但是在这“一天等于二十年”的年代，我们的工作还是赶不上形势的发展。从李富春、李先念二位副总理的报告中，我们看到，随着经济建设高潮的出现，一个声势浩大的文化建设高潮正在来到。现实生活正在向我们提出更高的要求：要求我们写出更多更好的作品来，更快、更真实、更有力地反映现实生活，作出更多、更好的表演，培养更多、更好的音乐干部。我们怎样来满足人民对我们的期望呢？
      音乐艺术的“纲”
      就是我们的思想
    在工农业生产中，我们已经找到了推动全面的“纲”，在音乐艺术创造中，我们以为“纲”就是我们的思想。音乐工作者必须以马克思列宁主义武装自己，树立起无产阶级世界观，站在时代的前面，才能创造出最新最美的音乐艺术。但是许多音乐工作者的头脑中还有不少非无产阶级思想，尽管我们生活在二十世纪的沸腾的六十年代，每个城市每个乡村都响彻着跃进的歌声，有的人却还怀着陈旧的感情，沉迷在十九世纪西欧爱情歌曲中。当前我们的一个严重任务是认真学习毛主席著作，特别是他的文艺思想，认真改造我们的世界观。不破不立，必须彻底批判资产阶级思想，特别是对十八十九世纪西欧资产阶级艺术的迷信，必须以历史唯物主义观点进行彻底批判，才能破除；必须和文艺领域中的现代修正主义思想进行不调和的斗争。唯有巩固地建立起无产阶级世界观，才能坚定不移地执行文艺为工农兵服务的阶级路线；才能完成以共产主义思想教育人民的政治任务；才能完成创造出表现我们这时代、我们这民族的最新、最美的音乐这个历史任务。“什么时代唱什么歌，什么阶级说什么话”，我们要做工人阶级的代言人。社会主义、共产主义是我们这时代的最强音。我们把宣传人类最先进的社会主义、共产主义思想，用歌声迎接人类的春天——共产主义社会的到来，看为我们光荣的职责。
    这次大会是在技术革新的群众运动高潮中召开的，许多同志在发言中谈到了生产战线上的技术革新和技术革命，也启发了我们来考虑音乐工作上的革新和革命。
      标民族之“新”
      立阶级之“异”
    尽管艺术生产和物质生产的规律不完全相同，但是文艺劳动也必须破除迷信、解放思想、敢想敢做、勇于创新，这样的精神却是与生产战线上共同的。我们并不认为现有的音乐创作、演唱演奏上的艺术表现手段已经尽善尽美了，虽然总的说来，已有了很大的提高，但是为了更富于表现力地反映我们人民丰富多彩的生活面貌和精神面貌，为了“标民族之新，立阶级之异”，为了使我们的音乐艺术在世界上大放异彩，应该说我们目前的音乐艺术水平还有待提高，我们的许多作品还没有能够把人民生活中丰富的精神面貌和先进思想表达出来，我们还不善于创造性地运用各种外来音乐形式。如何把我国民族音乐的优秀传统和现代音乐技巧和现代音乐形式完美地结合起来，创造出社会主义的民族的新音乐艺术，即如何使外来音乐形式更为民族化、群众化，成为我们人民感到亲切的、喜闻乐见的艺术形式；属于民族固有的艺术样式如戏曲音乐、说唱音乐等，如何使之在原有基础上加以发展，使之适合于刻划新的英雄人物。我们高兴地看到去年国庆献礼作品中一些青年作者的作品如“青年钢琴协奏曲”、“梁祝小提琴协奏曲”、“幸福河大合唱”、“洪湖赤卫队”，受到了广大听众的欢迎。前三个作品的作曲者都是年轻的音乐学院学生，他们在劳动锻炼中在和劳动人民一同生活中，获得了许多新的感受，他们掌握了一定的业务技术而又不为清规戒律所束缚，他们在一定程度上利用了民间音乐的表现手法，但又为大跃进精神所鼓舞而勇于推陈出新，这个成就也是在党的领导、老师的帮助和同学们的鼓励下取得的，这些经验和工厂中的技术革新有不少共同点，它启发我们应该鼓励大家运用这些经验，大胆地多方面地去进行创造。
      要把音乐艺术
      交给群众自己
    由于形势的飞快发展，现有的音乐干部从数量上说也是显然赶不上工作需要。除了由各地音乐院校培养干部外，各个音乐歌舞团体，甚至于音乐研究机关，也都可以像工厂大办学校一样，利用一切力量和设备培养后备力量，帮助公社、工厂培养业余音乐活动骨干分子。如果各音乐院校及有条件的专业团体能附设工农业余音乐干部短期训练班，这将对开展工农音乐活动有莫大好处。在师资特别缺乏的情况下，我们一方面要继续挖掘内部潜力，另一方面也可以动员不脱产的民间艺人来做短期教员，或是学生登门学习；此外也还要充分利用现代设备如：电视机、电台、唱片等举办各种音乐讲座，传授演唱、演奏、创作的技术。总之，群众对开展业余音乐活动有迫切需要，我们必须千方百计把音乐艺术交给群众自己，使音乐艺术也能遍地开花。
    在这六十年代的开始，我们满怀信心地展望将来：在党的领导下，我们将建立起一支又红又专的全心全意为人民服务的音乐工作者队伍，在继续跃进的年代中，吹起向共产主义前进的进军号，歌颂我们的总路线、大跃进和人民公社，歌颂我们时代的英雄人物，歌颂我们美好的新生活，鼓舞人民在社会主义、共产主义大路上前进。在音乐工作者的行列中，来自工农兵业余文化活动的音乐天才大量涌现，群众艺术的花朵将要开遍新中国的全境，我们的音乐艺术也将攀登上世界音乐艺术的最高峰。让我们都来为实现这美好的远景而努力吧！
