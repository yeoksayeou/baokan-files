Excerpts from Foreign News

    Editor's Note: The American "Worker's Weekly" recently published an article exposing the U.S. monopoly capital's control of the Cuban economy. Excerpts are translated as follows:

    The exploiters of Cuba and Chile have very close relations. Anaconda Copper Company is the biggest boss in Chile. Anaconda is controlled by First National City Bank of New York. And this bank with a capital of ten billion dollars is the largest financial power in Cuba. "Citibank" has ten branches in this revolutionary island. It is deeply involved in Cuba's sugar industry. It has controlled Cuba's telephone business for many years through International Telephone and Telegraph Company. It may not be a coincidence that U.S. Ambassador to Havana, Bonsal, was previously a manager of International Telephone and Telegraph Company. Ambassador Bonsal has been the representative of International Telephone and Telegraph Company in Cuba, Spain, and Chile for many years.

    This bank is headed by James Rockefeller, the nephew of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. John McCloy, president of Rockefeller's Chase Manhattan Bank, is a major director of United Fruit Company. This company owns 500,000 acres of land in the Caribbean. Decades ago, it acquired tens of thousands of acres of land in Cuba for very little money. Therefore, it is very resentful of Prime Minister Castro's land reform policy.

    The biggest mining magnate in Cuba is John Hay Whitney, the main boss of the "New York Herald Tribune". Publisher Whitney was also Ike's (former) ambassador to London. His nickel is located near Moa Bay in Oriente Province, Cuba. This is the largest nickel mine south of Canada. Whitney controls this mine through his Freeport Sulphur Company. He exploited Cuba's cheap labor with the help of Batista's henchmen until Castro's people's revolution succeeded.

### 美国垄断资本为什么痛恨古巴革命？

    美国垄断资本为什么痛恨古巴革命？
    编者按：美国“工人周报”最近发表了一篇文章，揭露美国垄断资本控制古巴经济的情况。现摘译如下：
    古巴和智利的剥削者关系十分密切。安那康达铜公司是智利的最大老板。安那康达公司是由纽约第一花旗银行控制的。而这个有一百亿美元资本的银行是在古巴的最大的金融力量。“花旗银行”在这个革命的岛国有十家分行。它深深地渗入了古巴的食糖工业。它通过国际电话电报公司多年来控制着古巴的电话事业。美国驻哈瓦那大使邦沙尔是国际电话电报公司以前的一个经理，这可能不是一个巧合。邦沙尔大使多年来在古巴、西班牙和智利是国际电话电报公司的代表。
    这家银行是詹姆斯·洛克菲勒领导的，他是纽约州长纳尔逊·洛克菲勒的侄儿。洛克菲勒的曼哈顿大通银行行长约翰·麦克洛伊是联合果品公司的主要董事。这家公司在加勒比海地区有五十万英亩的土地。几十年以前它在古巴以很少的钱取得了几万英亩的土地。因此它对卡斯特罗总理的土地改革政策非常痛恨。
    在古巴的最大的采矿大王是“纽约先驱论坛报”的主要老板约翰·海·惠特尼。出版商惠特尼也是艾克（从前）的驻伦敦大使。他的镍是在古巴奥连特省的莫亚海湾附近。这是加拿大以南最大的镍矿。惠特尼是通过他的弗利波特硫磺公司控制这个矿的。他借巴蒂斯塔的打手的帮助剥削古巴的廉价劳动力，直到卡斯特罗的人民革命成功为止。
