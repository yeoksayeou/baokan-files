New Situation Requires New Leadership Methods

Editor's note: The economic front is in excellent shape. The great technical innovation and technical revolution movement has involved all workers in a fiery and boiling life. In order to quickly and widely report the new and important inventions and creations of the heroic people, the new and important work experience of all walks of life, and the new and important leadership methods of leading organs at all levels, we will frequently publish such brief news on each page. Some of these issues will be reported in detail later.

        Harbin Carries Out "Two Hundreds" Movement to Summarize Experience
    The Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently organized leading cadres at all levels to carry out a movement of "summarizing one hundred experiences and investigating one hundred typical examples" in order to quickly summarize the experience of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement and promote the movement to develop more widely and deeply along the correct, scientific, and national path. At present, party committees and administrative leading cadres at all levels in the city, districts, and enterprises are formulating topics and summary plans separately.

        "Four Transformations, Three Remotes, Eight-Pronged Advance"
    According to the development of the technical innovation movement in the city, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently put forward a new mobilization slogan to the city's workers, namely "Four Transformations, Three Remotes, Eight-Pronged Advance." "Four Transformations" are: mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation; "Three Remotes" are: "remote control, remote measurement, remote communication," that is, remote control, remote measurement, remote signaling; "Eight Prongs" are: "Four Transformations," "Three Remotes," chipless processing, tool reform, comprehensive utilization, design reform, process reform, and reform of management tools. This slogan has pushed Harbin's technical innovation movement into a new stage.

      Shijiazhuang Launches "Advanced Experience Doesn't Stay Overnight" Movement
    The Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized leading cadres at all levels in the city to launch a "advanced experience doesn't stay overnight" movement. As soon as the municipal party committee secretaries discovered advanced experiences worthy of promotion, they immediately convened on-site meetings to organize promotion. Many enterprises have achieved that as soon as an innovative creation that can be promoted appears in a workshop, it is immediately spread to other workshops. High-speed promotion of advanced experience has already become a trend in the city.

        Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Vigorously Grabs Backward Enterprises
    The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently conducted a major ranking of all factories in the city and found that the development of the technical innovation movement was uneven: large factories were better than small factories, and key factories were better than general factories. The municipal party committee then put more leadership strength into small factories and general factories. The municipal party committee recently convened an on-site promotion meeting for small factories in the city at the Taiyuan Automobile Company, which had previously had poor movement development. This company increased its degree of mechanization by 20% overnight, and the number of innovation projects realized within three days was more than in the previous two months.

    Changsha Organizes Surplus Labor to Expand Reproduction
    Changsha City, Hunan Province, promptly transferred the labor force and tools and equipment saved after technical innovation and quickly invested them in expanding reproduction. In addition to strengthening the iron and steel, coke, and cement industries to support the construction and expansion of new enterprises, many factories and enterprises adopted the method of "hens laying eggs" and established more than 1,060 satellite factories in more than a month. Some of these satellite factories produce or process raw materials; some are engaged in comprehensive utilization of raw materials and processing and utilization of waste materials; some are trial-producing and producing new products, advancing towards "high, precise, and cutting-edge." This approach has promoted the further development of industrial production and technical innovation movement in the city.

    Mudanjiang City's Management Tool Great Revolution
    Mudanjiang City is carrying out a great revolution in management work centered on the creation of rapid calculation tools and electrified and automated management tools. According to incomplete statistics, in January and February of this year, the city has created 246 types and more than 7,300 pieces of special rapid calculation tools and electrified and automated management tools suitable for production in various industries and various types of work. These innovations are conducive to resolving the contradiction between enterprise management and the leap-forward development of productive forces; these innovations mark a new stage in the reform of enterprise management work in the city, from general simplification of procedures, forms and reports, and improvement of systems, to improving management tools towards electrification, automation, scientific development, and more mass-based development.

    Fujian Two Tea Factories Achieve Production Automation
    One of China's three major scented tea factories - Fuzhou Tea Factory in Fujian Province - recently manufactured many mechanized and automated equipment through self-reliance, turning production from 80% manual operation to 96% of workers engaged in mechanized and automated production; manpower has been saved by 72% compared with the past, and work efficiency has increased by one to one hundred times compared with the past.

    The No. 1 Tea Factory in Eastern Fujian also recently manufactured more than 20 sets of machinery and equipment through self-reliance, realizing the full automation of tea making, saving 75% of the labor force, and increasing tea-making efficiency by 20.8 times compared with the past.

专栏：简要新闻

    新形势需要新的领导方法
    编者按：经济战线一片大好形势。伟大的技术革新和技术革命运动，把全体职工卷入了火热的、沸腾的生活。为了迅速地、广泛地报道英雄人民新的重要的发明创造，各行各业新的重要的工作经验，各级领导机关新的重要的领导方法，我们将在各版经常发表这样的简要新闻。其中有一些问题，以后再陆续作详细的报道。
        哈尔滨开展“两百”运动总结经验
    中共哈尔滨市委最近组织各级领导干部开展“百项经验总结，百项典型调查”的运动，以便迅速总结技术革新和技术革命运动的经验，促进运动沿着正确的科学的全民的轨道更广泛、更深入地发展。现在，市、区、企业等各级党委和行政领导干部正分头制定题目和总结计划。
        “四化，三遥，八路进军”
    中共哈尔滨市委根据全市技术革新运动的发展情况，最近向全市职工提出了一个新的动员口号，即“四化，三遥，八路进军”。“四化”是：机械化，半机械化，自动化，半自动化；“三遥”是：“遥控，遥测，遥讯”，即远距离控制，远距离测量，远距离给信号；“八路”是：“四化”，“三遥”，无屑加工，刃具改革，综合利用，设计改革，工艺改革，管理工具的改革。这一口号推动哈尔滨市的技术革新运动跨入了新阶段。
      石家庄掀起“先进经验不过夜”运动
    中共石家庄市委组织全市各级领导干部掀起了一个“先进经验不过夜”的运动。市委书记们一发现值得推广的先进经验，当天就召开现场会议组织推广。许多企业作到了一个车间出现了可以推广的革新创造，马上就传播到各个车间。高速度推广先进经验，已经在全市形成风气。
        中共太原市委狠抓后进企业
    中共太原市委最近通过对全市工厂大排队，发现技术革新运动开展得不平衡：大厂比小厂好，重点厂比一般厂好。市委随即将领导力量更多地放到小厂和一般工厂。市委最近在过去运动开展较差的太原市汽车公司召开了全市小厂现场促进会。这个公司在一夜之间就把机械化程度提高了20％，三天内实现的革新项目比前两个月还多。
    长沙组织节余劳力扩大再生产
    湖南省长沙市及时把革新技术后节省出来的劳动力和工具设备抽调出来，迅速投入扩大再生产。除加强钢铁、煤焦、水泥等工业，支援新建和扩建企业以外，许多工厂企业采取“母鸡下蛋”的办法，在一个多月的时间里，办起了一千零六十多个卫星工厂。这些卫星工厂有的生产或加工原材料；有的大搞原材料综合利用和加工利用废旧材料；有的试制和生产新产品，向“高精尖”进军。这种作法，推动了全市工业生产和技术革新运动的进一步开展。
    牡丹江市管理工具大革命
    牡丹江市开展以创制速算工具和电气化自动化管理工具为中心的管理工作大革新。据不完全统计，今年1、2月份，全市已经创造了二百四十六种、七千三百多件适合各行各业各工种生产用的专用速算工具和电气化自动化管理工具。这些革新，有利于解决企业管理同生产力飞跃发展不相适应的矛盾；这些革新标志着全市企业管理工作的革改，由一般的简化手续表报和改进制度，进入了改进管理工具向电气化、自动化、科学化发展，向更加群众化方向发展的新阶段。
    福建两茶厂生产自动化
    我国精制花茶的三大花茶厂之一——福建省福州茶厂，最近自力更生制造了许多机械化、自动化设备，使生产由80％是手工操作，一跃而为96％的工人从事机械化、自动化生产；人力比过去节省了72％，工效比过去提高一倍到百倍。
    福建闽东第一茶厂最近也自力更生制造了二十多部机器设备，实现了制茶叶全程自动化，节省了75％的劳动力，制茶效率比过去提高二十点八倍。
