Presidium, fellow representatives:

    I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian.

    The contents of these two reports reflect the aspirations of each of us for the economic development of our motherland. What particularly excites me is:

    1.  We have completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan in just two years, which is a great joy. In this way, we can free up three years to do more things, speed up our socialist construction, ensure a sustained great leap forward in the future, achieve the goal of catching up with Britain in the output of major industrial products ahead of schedule, achieve our agricultural program ahead of schedule, achieve our scientific plan ahead of schedule, and get rid of the backwardness of "poverty and blankness" more quickly.

    2.  From the reports, we can see that the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1958 was 184.1 billion yuan, in 1959 it was 241.3 billion yuan, and the plan for 1960 is 298 billion yuan. In just two short years, the total industrial and agricultural output value of our country has increased by 66%. Generally speaking, this speed exceeds that of capitalist countries by ten to twenty times.

    3.  The planned investment in capital construction for 1960 is 32.5 billion yuan. The First Five-Year Plan was 55 billion yuan. This means that the investment in one year in 1960 is equivalent to 59% of the five years of the First Five-Year Plan. The report points out that in terms of investment effectiveness, two yuan now are worth three yuan in the past. Calculated in this way, this year's investment in capital construction is equal to 48.7 billion yuan, which is almost equal to the total amount of the First Five-Year Plan.

    4.  The railway construction plan for 1960 in the report is 8,389 kilometers. Together with the construction of local railways, the total this year will exceed 10,000 kilometers. This is more than thirty times faster than the railway construction speed in old China (calculated according to the average of seventy years); about fifty times faster than the era of the Kuomintang reactionary regime (calculated according to the average of twenty-two years). This speed is unprecedented in the world's one hundred and thirty years of railway history. This is such an inspiring thing for the people of the whole country, especially for the railway workers!

    5.  Under the leadership of the Party, we have obtained the "Three Red Banners" of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. We have Mao Zedong Thought as the guide for all our work. This not only guarantees the successful completion of the 1960 national economic plan, but also guarantees that we will move from one victory to a greater victory, until we complete the second stage of communist construction.

    Below, I will talk about some situations and my experiences and feelings regarding technological innovation and technological revolution.

    Now, under the leadership of the Party, a great mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution is being carried out across the country with the momentum of "unity of purpose, galloping horses, a riot of color, and a new atmosphere." Before this conference, I participated in the on-site conference on technological innovation and technological revolution organized by the Ministry of Railways. I visited eight cities including Harbin, Shenyang, Anshan, Fuxin, Jinzhou, Tianjin, and Beijing, and visited many factories and enterprises. I saw the thousands of creations and inventions made by the workers under the leadership of the Party, and I saw the soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom shown by the masses under the leadership of the Party. This was inspiring and uplifting.

    In Harbin, I saw the new large-scale steam turbine generator designed and manufactured by our own country. This is an extraordinary thing. In old China, almost all the generators used were foreign products, and only small motors were manufactured domestically at that time. Under the leadership of the Party, we have been able to manufacture such large-scale steam turbine generators in just ten years, which is unprecedented in the history of world industrial development. It marks that China's industry is developing at a leaping speed. With this technical experience and foundation, it will not be difficult to build larger units in the future.

    In Harbin, I also visited a joint machinery factory, which was organized by more than twenty small local factories run by workers. They do not have formal factory buildings, and they use old dormitories as workshops. When the working area is not enough, they work on the road. When we visited, the workers were manufacturing large mining machinery in the yard in the cold weather of minus twenty-four degrees. The machinery and equipment are very simple, mostly self-made local machine tools. They use the method of "ants gnawing at bones" to make various kinds of machines. Small factories do big jobs. Everyone said that this factory is "a phoenix coming out of a chicken coop." The visitors were all moved by their spirit of hard work, practical work, poor work plus smart work. This factory is really a good hospital for those who suffer from right-leaning conservative ideas such as "conditionalism," "reaching the top," and "no potential to be tapped." It is a very good doctor for those engineering and technical personnel who only believe in foreign things and not in local things. Combining this factory with the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory mentioned above is a model of walking on two legs.

    In Fuxin, what impressed us most was the atmosphere of "the whole country as a chessboard." Railway and coal mine cooperation, Fuxin is the birthplace, the relationship between the railway and the mine is like a family. Whether it is people from the railway or people from the coal mine, as soon as someone says "you" or "we" to separate the family, the workers will object, "What's yours and mine, it's all the country's." It is precisely because the communist ideology of the whole country as a chessboard and the great cooperation between the railway and the mine is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people that the transportation work efficiency in Fuxin is particularly high. Recently, with the promotion of the technological revolution movement, they have done a lot of mechanized and automated work, which has made the work efficiency develop even more rapidly. In the past, the time vehicles stayed in the mine has now been cut in half. Recently, because of the large-scale "one-dragon" movement, some "rocket" trains have even cut the time by 90%. The "one-dragon" cooperation is a creation of our country. It can only be realized under the socialist system.

    In Tianjin, I visited a flour mill—Tianjin No. 1 Flour Mill. Its original design capacity was 4,700 bags per day. Under the leadership of the Party committee, through the efforts of all employees and through the technological revolution movement, more than ten processes in the production process have been fully automated. This has increased production fivefold, saved 335 people, the quality is completely up to standard, the cost reduction ranks first in Hebei Province, and the production outlook has been completely renewed. The spiritual outlook has also changed accordingly. The communist style of mutual help, mutual learning, and daring to think and dare to do among workers is even higher. More workers are demanding to learn culture. This is a clear example of how technological revolution drives cultural revolution. The successful automation of production has eliminated carrying, lifting, and handling, which is a major event for the porters in the factory. Comrade Zhang Fengqi, a worker, said: "We have been liberated once again." Comrade Jiang Enrong, an old worker, said: "I have been carrying loads on my shoulders since I was fourteen years old. I had to carry three hundred loads every day. My back and legs were sore. Today, I am holding a small red flag to direct the wheat conveyor belt. I really never dreamed of this. We must repay the Party's kindness." Worker Ma Qifu compiled a clapper rhyme: "In the past, we were tired from work, and we were sweating all over when we went to work. Now wheat is flowing through the machines, solving the key to production. We thank the Communist Party, we sing the praises of the General Line."

    In the railway sector, as in other sectors, the technological innovation and technological revolution movement has also been carried out vigorously, and now a new climax has been formed. Taking the Shenyang Railway Bureau as an example, after the Party committee issued a call in February, in just twenty days, the employees put forward more than 70,000 innovation proposals. Now almost all employees are enthusiastically involved in this movement. The example of the Shenyang Railway Bureau is not an isolated case. Many railway employees have shown the same enthusiasm. The workers' determination for technological innovation and technological revolution can be represented by the following words of the workers: "Fear nothing, fear nothing, we are determined to engage in automation." In the movement, especially in the "production sports meeting" or "technical performance competition," new people and new things emerge one after another, like bamboo shoots after a rain. A responsible comrade of a railway bureau said: "The situation here is changing with each passing day," which is widely representative. As for the new things created by the masses, they are really "numerous and beautiful." Many of them belong to the category of "high, large, precise, advanced, and new." Such as electric locomotives, diesel locomotives, new types of vehicles, the "one-dragon" in transportation, the twelve automations in locomotives, the automation of local humps in shunting, the automatic tamping machine in road maintenance, the multi-channel carrier machine in telecommunications, automatic signals, the further development of the method of building bridge pile columns, the automatic production line in car manufacturing, directional blasting and large blasting in construction, mechanization, semi-mechanization, and automation of loading and unloading operations, etc. These are playing a revolutionary role in improving labor productivity, speeding up speed, and reducing costs on the railway. The rapid and large-scale improvement of the working conditions of the working people further proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.

    In this technological revolution movement, the "three-combination" method proposed by the Party has been widely used and has achieved good results. The effect is particularly significant for comprehensive and relatively complex key technical problems. The forms have also been greatly developed, including "three-combination", "five-combination" (cadres, workers, technicians, teachers, students), three-combination within the factory (cadres, workers, technicians), three-combination outside the factory (production departments, research institutions, universities), three-combination teams, three-combination shock brigades, etc. The three-combination method not only greatly improves labor productivity and rapidly improves production capacity, but more importantly: engaging in three-combination on a large scale can combine theory with practice; combine popularization with improvement; combine scientific research, teaching with production; combine education with productive labor. Three-combination has a more profound significance for narrowing the gap between manual and mental workers.

    From this technological innovation and technological revolution movement, I have initially realized the following points:

    1.  The technological innovation and technological revolution movement has greatly advanced the productive forces and rapidly increased labor productivity, which has had a profound impact on the production front.

    2.  The leap forward in productive forces further requires the relations of production to adapt to it. Some things in the superstructure, such as the wage system, labor organization, technical classification, work quotas, management systems, etc., need to be reconsidered and reformed accordingly.

    3.  The "two participations, one transformation, and three combinations" method proposed by the Party has been developed in this movement. In the future, we must promote it more widely and vigorously.

    4.  Our engineering and technical personnel should recognize that in this national movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, it is a great opportunity for us to contribute more to national construction, a great opportunity for us to learn from the masses, a great opportunity to temper ourselves to further establish a proletarian world outlook, and a great opportunity to transform the objective world while transforming our subjective world.

    5.  Technological revolution drives cultural revolution, and cultural revolution in turn promotes technological revolution.

    6.  No matter in which factory or enterprise, one can realize that the Party's General Line has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and has become an endless force, and further realize the correctness and great guiding role of the mass line, the policy of walking on two legs, and a whole set of parallel approaches.

    In short, putting politics in command and the leadership of the Party are the guarantee for achieving victory in various tasks, and Mao Zedong Thought is the guide for all work.

    Please correct me if the above is inappropriate.

### 技术人员要为技术革命做更多的工作  石志仁代表的发言

专栏：

    技术人员要为技术革命做更多的工作
    石志仁代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告。
    这两个报告的内容，反映了我们每一个人对祖国经济发展的愿望。特别使我欢欣鼓舞的是：
    一、我们只用了二年的时间就完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标，这是一件天大的喜事。这样，我们就腾出三年的时间可以作更多的事情。使我们建设社会主义的速度更快，保证今后能持续大跃进；使我们在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国的目标提前实现；使我们的农业纲要提前实现；使我们的科学规划提前实现；使我们更快地摆脱“一穷二白”的落后面貌。
    二、从报告里我们看到：1958年的工农业总产值是一千八百四十一亿元，1959年是二千四百一十三亿元，1960年计划是二千九百八十亿元，短短两年之中，我国的工农业总产值就增加了66％。一般来说，这个速度就超过了资本主义国家十倍以至二十倍。
    三、基建投资1960年计划为三百二十五亿元，第一个五年计划是五百五十亿元，这就是说1960年一年就相当于第一个五年计划五年的59％。报告里指出，按投资效果说，现在的两块钱就顶从前的三块钱，这样计算，则今年的基建投资就等于四百八十七亿元，几乎等于第一个五年计划的总数。
    四、报告里1960年的铁路建设是八千三百八十九公里，连同地方铁路的建设，今年总数将超过一万公里。这比旧中国的铁路建设速度加快了三十多倍，（按七十几年的平均数计算）；比国民党反动政权时代加快了约五十倍，（按二十二年的平均数计算）。这个速度，就世界上一百三十多年的铁路历史来说，是空前的。这对于全国人民特别是对于铁路职工来说，是多么令人欢欣鼓舞啊！
    五、我们在党的领导下，已获得了“总路线”、“大跃进”、“人民公社”三宝。我们有毛泽东思想作为我们一切工作的指针。不但保证1960年国民经济计划胜利完成，并可保证我们从一个胜利走向更大的胜利，直到完成共产主义建设的第二阶段。
    以下我谈一谈关于技术革新和技术革命一些情况和我的一些体会和感想。
    现在全国各地，在党的领导下，正以“万众一心、万马奔腾、万紫千红、万象更新”的气势，开展着技术革新和技术革命的伟大群众运动。在这次大会前，我因参加铁道部召开的技术革新和技术革命巡回现场会议，曾到哈尔滨、沈阳、鞍山、阜新、锦州、天津、北京八个城市，参观了许多工厂和企业，看到了工人同志们在党的领导下所搞出来的成千上万项的创造与发明，看到了群众在党的领导下所表现的冲天干劲和无穷智慧，使人精神振奋，心情鼓舞。
    在哈尔滨时，曾看到我国自己设计、自己制造的新式大型的汽轮发电机。这是一件不平凡的事情。在旧中国使用的发电机，几乎全部是外国货，那时国内制造的只是小电机。在党的领导下，只有十年的工夫，我们就能制造这样大型的汽轮发电机，在世界工业发展史上是空前的。它标志着我国的工业正在以飞跃的速度发展着。有了这个技术经验和基础，以后再造更大的机组就不困难了。
    在哈尔滨又参观了一个机联厂，这是由工人办的二十多个小土厂联合组织起来的，他们没有正式厂房，利用老宿舍作车间，工作面积不够，就在马路上作活。当我们参观的时候，工人们正在零下二十四度的寒冷天气，在院子里露天制造大件矿山机器。机器设备很简陋，多是自造的土机床，他们以“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法造各式各样的机器，小工厂干大活。大家说这个厂是“鸡窝出凤凰”。参观的人对他们那种苦干、实干、穷干加巧干的精神莫不感动。这个工厂对那些犯“条件论”、“到顶论”、“无潜力可挖”等等右倾保守思想的患者，实在是一个好医院。对于那些只信洋的不信土的工程技术人员是一个非常好的医生。将这个厂与上面所说的哈尔滨电机厂结合着看，是两条腿走路的典范。
    在阜新使我们感到最深刻的是那里的“全国一盘棋”的气氛。铁路煤矿大协作，阜新是发源地，路矿关系如一家。不论是铁路上的人或是煤矿上的人，一说“你们”“我们”分家的话，工人就提意见，“什么你的我的，都是国家的”。正是由于全国一盘棋路矿大协作的共产主义思想深入人心，在阜新的运输工作效率，就特别高。近来又以技术革命运动的推动，他们搞了许多机械化自动化的工作，使工作效率更飞跃发展。从前车辆的留矿时间，现在已砍了一半。最近又因为大搞“一条龙”运动，有的“火箭”列车甚至将时间砍了90％。“一条龙”大协作是我国的创举，它只有在社会主义制度下，才有实现的可能。
    在天津曾参观了一个面粉厂——天津第一面粉厂。它的原设计能力是每日生产四千七百袋。在党委的领导下，经全体职工的努力，通过技术革命运动，将生产过程十余工序完全自动化了。这使生产翻了五番，节约三百三十五人，质量完全合标准，成本降低居河北全省第一位，生产面貌为之一新。精神面貌也随之改变。工人之间互相帮助、互相学习、敢想敢干的共产主义风格更高了，工人要求学习文化的人更多了，技术革命带动文化革命这是一个显明的例子。生产自动化成功，消灭了背、抬、扛，这对厂内搬运工人来说，是一件天大的事情。工人张凤岐同志说：“我们又解放了一次。”老工人姜恩荣同志说：“我从十四岁就扛肩，每天要扛三百肩，腰酸腿疼，今天我拿着小红旗指挥麦子传送带，真是作梦也没想到，我们一定要报答党的恩情”。工人马启富编了快板“过去劳动累了咱，上班就是满身汗，如今小麦顺着机器转，解决生产大关键，我们感谢共产党，我们歌颂总路线”。
    在铁路方面与在其他方面一样，技术革新和技术革命运动也轰轰烈烈地开展了，现在已形成新高潮。以沈阳局为例，在2月间党委发出号召后，仅在二十天内，职工就提出了七万多项革新建议，到现在几乎全部职工都热火朝天地卷入了这个运动。沈阳局的例子并不是个别的，许多铁路的职工，都显示了同样的干劲。职工们对技术革新技术革命的决心，可以以下边工人的话来代表“天不怕、地不怕、一心要搞自动化”。在运动中特别是在“生产运动会”或“技术表演赛”上，新人新事，层出不穷，真如雨后春笋一样。有的路局负责同志说：“这里的局面是日新月异，朝夕不同”，这句话有广泛的代表性。至于群众创造出来的新东西，真是“种类繁多，美不胜收”。其中有许多是属于“高、大、精、尖、新”的范畴的。如电力机车、内燃机车、新型车辆，运输方面的“一条龙”，机车方面的十二自动化，调车方面的土驼峰自动化，养路方面的自动捣固机，电讯方面的多路载波机，自动信号，造桥管柱方法的进一步发展，造车方面的生产自动线，施工方面的定向爆破和大爆破，装卸作业的机械化半机械化、自动化等等。这些对于提高劳动生产率、加快速度、降低成本，都在铁路上起着革命性的作用，而对于迅速地、大规模地改善劳动人民的劳动条件，更足证明社会主义制度较资本主义制度具有无比的优越性。
    在这次技术革命运动中，党提出来的三结合方法，获得普遍的使用，并收到了良好的效果。特别是对综合性的、比较复杂的技术关键问题，效果尤为显著。其形式亦有很大的发展，有“三结合”，“五结合”（干部、工人、技术人员、教师、学生），厂内三结合（干部、工人、技术人员），厂外三结合（生产部门、研究机关、高等院校），三结合小组，三结合突击队等等。三结合的方法，不仅使劳动生产率大大提高，使生产能力迅速提高，而更重要的是：大搞三结合，可以使理论与实际相结合；普及与提高相结合；使科研、教学与生产相结合；使教育与生产劳动相结合。三结合对缩小体力劳动者与脑力劳动者之间的差别，具有更为深远的意义。
    从这次技术革新和技术革命运动中，我初步体会到下列几点：
    一、技术革新和技术革命运动使生产力有很大跃进，使劳动生产率迅速的增长，在生产战线上发生深远的影响。
    二、生产力的跃进，进一步要求生产关系与它相适应。上层建筑的一些东西，如工资制度、劳动组织、技术分等、工时定额、管理制度等等，都需要从新考虑作相应的改革。
    三、党提出的“两参一改三结合”的方法，在这次运动中得到发展，今后我们要更加广泛地大力地推广。
    四、我们工程技术人员应认识到在这次技术革新和技术革命的全民运动中，是我们对国家建设贡献更多力量的一个大好机会，是我们向群众学习的一个大好机会，是锻炼自己进一步树立无产阶级世界观的大好机会，是从事改造客观世界同时改造自己的主观世界的大好机会。
    五、技术革命带动文化革命，文化革命又回过头来推动技术革命。
    六、无论在哪一个工厂或哪一个企业里，都可体会到党的总路线深入人心已变成无穷无尽的力量，更进一步体会到群众路线和两条腿走路及一整套并举的方针的正确性及其伟大的指导作用。
    总之，政治挂帅，党的领导，是在各种工作中，取得胜利的保证，毛泽东思想则是一切工作的指针。
    以上是否妥当请各位代表指正。
