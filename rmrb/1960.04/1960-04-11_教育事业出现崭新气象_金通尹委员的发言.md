Education Shows a New Look
Speech by Committee Member Jin Tongyin
Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee. I listened to and preliminarily studied with great excitement and pleasure Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. I fully support these three reports.

The Party has creatively applied and developed Marxist-Leninist educational principles in the leadership of China's education, and formulated the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor." This is a comprehensive educational policy, the only way to cultivate comprehensively developed individuals. Under the leadership of the Party, schools at all levels have strived to implement this policy over the past two years. China's education has achieved great success, rapidly and correctly advancing in the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao: "to enable those receiving education to develop in moral, intellectual, and physical aspects, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." Through two years of political and ideological education, theoretical study, various political activities, practical work, and labor practice, especially under the impetus and inspiration of the Great Leap Forward on the economic front and the people's commune movement, a profound educational revolution has been carried out. Recently, the general line of building socialism and the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party have been widely and deeply studied. The ranks of teachers at all levels have undergone great changes, advancing at different paces on the road to becoming both red and expert. The vast number of young students have also understood to varying degrees "for whom to study," recognized their training goals, and school education has shifted from the three separations (separation of business from politics, theory from practice, and teaching from production) of bourgeois education to the three combinations of proletarian education, presenting a vigorous and solid new atmosphere.

Political command and the mass line are the fundamental reasons for the significant achievements in education.

Taking my workplace, Wuhan Technical University of Surveying and Mapping, as an example, the victory of the Party's educational policy is manifested in the following aspects:

First, political command, the Party has established strong leadership in all departments of the school. "Listen to the Party, go wherever the Party points" has become a unanimous action slogan for most people. The Party's prestige has taken root in people's hearts. The slanderous and erroneous arguments of right-wing elements, such as "the Party cannot lead teaching" and "the Party cannot lead scientific research," have been completely bankrupt in the face of facts. In the past, many people were convinced of the school's Party committee secretary, but not of the Party branch secretaries of various departments; now, the Party's leadership in various departments has been universally established. After the anti-rightist rectification campaign, intellectuals gradually shifted from fearing to admiring the Party's leadership, and the distance with the Party is gradually narrowing, although repeated fluctuations always exist, the mainstream is forward.

The Party has grasped political and ideological work. Leading comrades of the Party at all levels directly participate in the teaching of political classes, with divisions of labor extending to various departments and student classes. Several debates were launched among teachers and students on the issue of redness and expertise, and on the relationship between politics and business. In-depth discussions, using the abstract to drive the concrete, serious debates, enhancing understanding, clarifying direction, the effect is significant. In the education revolution, bourgeois teaching ideology and bourgeois teaching systems have been strictly criticized. Many veteran teachers have undergone a drastic shock, further recognized themselves, and thus have further demands for transformation. Most people have begun to undergo great changes. Serving whom, studying for whom, the vast number of teachers and students have clearly distinguished right from wrong in the struggle between the two roads and the two worldviews, and achieved victory. Of course, such struggles must continue unremittingly to the end.

Second is the mass line. The essence of the general line is high speed and the mass line. The Party's leadership is based on relying on the masses and fully mobilizing the masses. Can education engage in mass movements? The practice of our school proves that it can. After breaking superstitions and emancipating their minds, the vast number of young teachers and students have developed a communist style of daring to think and daring to do. Through the three-way combination of Party leadership, teachers, and students, using the method of large-scale operations, many textbooks that previously took years to write, such as several drafts of surveying textbooks, increased from tens of thousands of words to five or six hundred thousand words, are now written in one or two months to four or five months. A translation of a 300,000-400,000 word manuscript for engineering surveying, completed by about one hundred students under the guidance of teachers, in a concentrated effort in less than two weeks. Scientific research projects at our school previously were not completed well, but now have made significant progress through the mass line. The problem of the graphics of the encrypted second-class network used for large-scale mapping was completed by eleven teachers and thirty-six students. The problem of compiling maps for people's communes was completed by the cooperation of more than sixty teachers and students. The research on the necessary accuracy of the layout of urban control networks was completed by adopting large-scale operations. Whether it is writing textbooks or scientific research, the mass line ensures high speed, and collective wisdom ensures quality.

Production practice is the most effective way to link theory with practice.

In terms of combining with production, first is professional production. Under the leadership of the National Bureau of Surveying and Mapping, our school participates in the surveying production team work in various regions. A total of 2,000 teachers and students have departed over the past two years. The types of operations include aerial surveying, inside and outside, geodetic surveying, gravity surveying, astronomical surveying, railway, tunnel, hydropower station, mining area, urban surveying, map compilation, etc. The area of work that can be calculated is 11,500 square kilometers. The provinces and regions reached are Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Shanxi, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan and other places. The duration of each experience is two or three months to nine or ten months.

Through professional production practice, teachers and students have gained extremely in terms of political thought and professionally. Among them, there is such a recognition: the quality of learning cannot be judged solely by the amount of theoretical knowledge in books, but by whether problems can be solved in production. To solve problems in production, it is only necessary to implement the Party's education policy. In the production process, they can appreciate that political command and following the mass line are the guarantees of success. They can clearly see the grand prospects of socialist construction from their own labor, and their own labor has the pioneering significance of "opening up the world." The labor viewpoint and the love for the profession naturally grow in production practice. Through production, the operation of instruments is proficient, and the speed of operation is improved. Through practice, classroom knowledge is systematically mastered and consolidated, the theory is confirmed, scientific research activities are carried out, and the theory is improved. They put forward rationalization proposals at any time during production practice, and they can contribute to technological innovation and technological revolution. Production practice also exercises organizational and leadership skills, gives play to the role of the collective, and thus realizes the necessity of participating in social activities and class activities in schools. Theory and practice, teaching and production are closely combined in production practice, and the teaching quality is definitely improved. In the past, students who graduated had to go through a period of internship before they could officially work, but now students who have not graduated have already participated in the production team.

Since the large-scale steel production, teachers and students of our school are still continuing to produce coke and iron. Agricultural and sideline production should strive for self-sufficiency within a certain period. Teachers and students participate in agricultural and sideline labor, with full enthusiasm, which has become the school's atmosphere. Outside the school, the entire school's teachers and students participated in the labor on the East-West Lake dike in the north of Hankou last year, and this year they participated in the labor of the Handan Railway project. Other public welfare labor such as drought resistance, transportation, and fertilizer accumulation have been participated in by some teachers and students.

Through production practice, industrial and agricultural labor and other public welfare labor, the vast number of teachers and students, especially young students, have begun to establish the proletarian labor viewpoint, from correcting the labor attitude to cherishing the fruits of labor, gradually becoming one with the working people in emotion and life. By doing so, the difference between physical labor and mental labor can be gradually reduced. The people cultivated under the guidance of the Party's education policy will undoubtedly be comprehensively developed people who are adapted to the needs of the transition from socialism to communism. These are all great victories of the Party's education policy.

In fact, any kind of university or middle and primary school, under the guidance of the Party's education policy, has the same task and the same direction for developing comprehensive education and cultivating comprehensively developed talents. I only look at this great victory from one corner. What I see is too narrow, and what I say is not deep or thorough enough, with many omissions. Comrades can definitely put forward thousands of examples to clarify the correctness of the Party's education policy and confirm the victories achieved by various types and levels of schools in implementing this policy over the past two years.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian quoted Chairman Mao's words in his report: "With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear," and then pointed out: A greater high tide of cultural construction is about to be set off throughout the country. Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report specifically put forward the planned targets for scientific research and cultural, educational, and health undertakings, and pointed out: In developing education, we must continue to strengthen the Party's leadership, adhere to the policy of education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor. The reports of the two Vice Premiers Li showed a magnificent picture of a comprehensive Great Leap Forward under the brilliant illumination of the general line. The Party's general line guarantees that the socialist cause is invincible, unconquerable, and successful in its advance. The general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes are the three magic weapons for China's high-speed socialist construction. Various types and levels of schools, according to the requirements of the general line, use practical actions to invest in the increase production and practice economy movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, continue to deepen the education revolution, earnestly study the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, Mao Zedong Thought, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide our education work, we can cultivate a large number of talents who are both red and expert to serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction, thus implementing the Party's education policy. On the basis of the existing achievements, as long as we adhere to the Party's leadership, adhere to the mass line, adhere to the general line, set high ambitions, establish lofty ideals, and like other socialist undertakings, the continued Great Leap Forward in 1960 is certain. The Party's education policy in the high tide of cultural construction must, and will certainly be able to, achieve continuous victory and comprehensive victory.

### 教育事业出现崭新气象  金通尹委员的发言

专栏：

    教育事业出现崭新气象
    金通尹委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意陈叔通副主席关于政协全国委员会常委会的工作报告。我以万分兴奋愉快的心情听了并初步学习了李富春副总理关于1960年国家经济计划的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告，谭震林副总理关于为争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要而斗争的报告。我完全拥护这三个报告。
    党在我国教育事业的领导上创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义的教育原则，制定了
  “教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针。这是全面发展的教育方针，是培养全面发展的人的唯一方法。在党的领导下，两年以来，各级学校努力贯彻执行了这个方针。我国教育事业获得了伟大的成就，迅速而正确地向毛主席所指出的“使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的方向迈进。通过两年来的政治思想教育、理论学习，各项政治活动、业务实践和劳动实践。特别是在经济战线上的大跃进和人民公社化运动的推动和鼓舞下进行了深刻的教育革命，最近又广泛深入地学习了建设社会主义总路线和党的八届八中全会的文件，各级学校教师的队伍起了很大的变化，不同步伐地向又红又专的道路上前进，广大的青年学生也不同程度地懂得了“为谁学习”，认清了自己的培养目标，学校教育已经从资产阶级教育的三脱离（业务脱离政治，理论脱离实际，教学脱离生产），向无产阶级教育的三结合转变，出现了轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实的崭新的气象。
    政治挂帅和群众路线是教育工作获得重大成就的根本原因
    以我的工作岗位武汉测绘学院为例，党的教育方针的胜利表现在下列各方面：
    首先是政治挂帅，党在学校各部门树立了坚强的领导。“听党的话，党指向哪里，就奔向哪里”，已成为大多数人一致的行动口号。党的威信已经深入人心。“党不能领导教学”，“党不能领导科学研究”等等右派分子的谰言谬论已经在事实面前完全破产了。从前对学校党委书记服气，对各系各部门的党支部书记不服气的大有人在，现在各部门党的领导已普遍地树立起来了。反右整风以后，知识分子对党的领导逐渐从畏服到悦服，同党的距离正在逐渐缩小，虽然反复波动随时存在，但主流是前进的。
    党抓紧了政治思想工作。各级党的负责同志直接参加政治课的教学工作，分工深入到各系和学生班级中去。在红专问题上，在政治与业务的关系上，师生中展开了几次辩论。深入务虚，以虚带实，认真辩论，提高认识，明确方向，效果很大。在教育革命中资产阶级教学思想、资产阶级教学体系都受到严格的批判，不少老教师经过一次剧烈的震动，对自己有进一步的认识，因而对改造也有进一步的要求，大多数人开始有了很大的转变。为谁服务，为谁学习，广大师生在两条道路、两种世界观的斗争中明辨了大是大非，取得了胜利。当然，这样的斗争还要继续不懈的进行到底。
    其次是群众路线。总路线的精神实质是高速度和群众路线。党的领导是建立在依靠群众、充分发动群众的基础上的。教育能不能搞群众运动？以我校的实践证明是能够的。广大青年教师和学生在破除迷信、解放思想之后，发扬了敢想、敢做的共产主义风格。通过党的领导同教师、学生的三结合，运用大兵团作战的方式，有不少教材，以前穷年累月写不出来的如测量学的几本讲稿，字数由十几万字到五六十万字，现在在一、二个月到四、五个月内写成了。工程测量专业一本三四十万字的翻译稿件，由一百左右的学生在教师的指导下，分工突击，不到两星期即完成了。我校的科学研究项目以前完成的不够好，现在通过群众路线有了显著的进展。用于大比例尺测图的加密二等网的图形问题，是由教师十一人学生三十六人完成的，人民公社编图问题是由六十多个师生合作完成的，城市控制网布设的必要精度问题的研究是采取大兵团作战完成的。无论是编写教材或者科学研究，群众路线保证了高速度，而集思广益也保证了质量。
    生产实习是理论联系实际的最有效的方法
    在结合生产方面，首先是专业生产，我校在国家测绘总局的领导下，参加各地区的测量生产队工作。两年间共出发师生二千人。作业种类为航空测量内外业，大地测量，重力测量，天文测量，铁路、隧道、水电站、矿区、城市测量，地图编绘等等。可以面积计算的工作为一万一千五百平方公里。所达到的省区为黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古、山东、福建、广东、江西、湖南、湖北、山西、新疆、四川、贵州、云南等地方。每次经历的时间为二三个月到九、十个月。
    通过专业生产实习，师生们在政治思想上和业务上都得到极大的收获。他们中间就有这样的认识：学习好坏不能专看书本上理论东西的多少，而要看能不能在生产中解决问题，要解决生产中的问题，只有贯彻党的教育方针。在生产过程中，他们能体会到政治挂帅和走群众路线是成功的保证。他们从自己的劳动中清楚地看到社会主义建设的宏伟前景，而他们自己的劳动具有“开天辟地”的尖兵意义。劳动观点和对专业的热爱在生产实习中很自然的成长起来。通过生产，仪器操作熟练了，作业的速度提高了。通过实践，系统地掌握和巩固了课堂知识，证实了理论，开展了科学研究活动，提高了理论。他们在生产实习中随时提出合理化建议，在技术革新、技术革命中他们能够有所贡献。生产实习也锻炼了组织和领导能力，发挥了集体作用，从而体会到在学校里参加社会活动、班组活动的必要性。理论同实际、教学同生产在生产实习中紧密地结合起来，肯定地提高了教学质量。过去毕业出去的学生须经过一个时期的见习方才可以正式工作，现在没有毕业的学生已经参加生产队了。
    我校师生从大办钢铁以来，现在仍继续出焦、炼铁。农副业生产于一定时期内要争取自给自足。师生参加农副业劳动，干劲十足，已成为学校的风气。在校外，全校师生于去年参加了汉口北面的东西湖堤上的劳动，今年又参加了汉丹铁路工程的劳动，其他如抗旱、运输、积肥等公益劳动都有部分师生参加。
    通过生产实习，工农业劳动和其他公益劳动，广大师生特别是青年学生开始树立了无产阶级的劳动观点，从端正劳动态度到珍视劳动成果，渐渐同劳动人民在感情上、生活上打成一片。这样做下去，体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别可以渐渐减少。以党的教育方针为指导所培养出来的人，无可置疑的将是适应于社会主义过渡到共产主义所需要的全面发展的人。这都是党的教育方针的伟大胜利。
    事实上，任何种类的大专学校，或中小学校，在党的教育方针指导下，对于发展全面教育的工作，培养全面发展的人才，任务是一样的，方向是一致的。我仅仅从一个角落来看这个伟大的胜利。所见到的是太狭隘了，讲来又不深不透，挂一漏万，同志们一定可以提出成千上万的例子来阐明党的教育方针的正确和证实各类各级学校两年来在贯彻这个方针中所取得的胜利。
    李先念副总理在报告中引用了毛主席的话“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮”，随即指出：在全国范围内即将掀起一个更大的文化建设高潮。李富春副总理的报告中具体提出了科学研究和文教卫生事业的计划指标，并指出：在发展教育事业中，必须继续加强党的领导，坚持教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合的方针。两位李副总理的报告展示了在总路线的光辉照耀下一幅宏丽的全面大跃进的图画。党的总路线保证了社会主义事业在前进中无坚不破，无攻不克，无往不利，无功不成。总路线、大跃进、人民公社是我国高速度进行社会主义建设的三大法宝。各类各级学校根据总路线的要求，用实际行动投入以技术革新、技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，继续深入进行教育革命，认真学习马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想来指导我们的教育工作，就可以培养出大批又红又专的人才，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，这样也就贯彻了党的教育方针。教育事业在已有成绩的基础上，只要坚持党的领导，坚持走群众路线，坚持总路线，立大志，树雄心，同其他社会主义事业一样，1960年的持续大跃进是肯定的。党的教育方针在文化建设的高潮中，一定要，也一定能够获得不断的胜利，全面的胜利。
