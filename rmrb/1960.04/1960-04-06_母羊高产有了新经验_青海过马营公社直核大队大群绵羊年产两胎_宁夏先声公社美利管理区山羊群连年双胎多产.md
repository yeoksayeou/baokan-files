    New Experience in High Yield of Ewes
    Large Flocks of Sheep in Zhihe Brigade of Guomaying Commune, Qinghai Produce Two Lambs a Year
    Ewe Flocks in Meili Management Area of Xiansheng Commune, Ningxia Produce Twins and Multiple Births for Consecutive Years
    (Reported by this newspaper) Can we break the convention of ewes only producing one lamb per year, and achieve two lambs a year or three lambs in two years, to promote the faster development of animal husbandry? Guomaying Commune in Guinan County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, has obtained a positive answer after two years of experimentation. Guomaying Commune concentrated 1,505 four- to six-year-old ewes in the Zhihe Brigade, mated them in July 1958, and produced 1,506 lambs in November and December. Immediately after lambing, artificial estrus induction and heat mating were carried out, and 512 lambs were produced again in May 1959. A total of 2,018 lambs were produced twice, with 2,004 surviving, achieving a survival rate of over 133% in about one year. What is particularly noteworthy is that the flock managed by model herdsman Ge Ri (Tibetan) had a reproduction survival rate exceeding 188%, basically achieving two lambs per year for each ewe. By the end of February this year, these seven experimental flocks had produced another 1,254 lambs, with 1,249 surviving. Thus, in the twenty months from July 1958 to February 1960, these ewes produced a total of 3,272 lambs in three batches, with 3,253 surviving. This shows that using artificial estrus induction and heat mating to promote two lambs per year or three lambs in two years is an important direction for the high-speed development of sheep production.
    In the autumn of the year before last, the Guomaying Commune decided to conduct a large-scale experiment on two lambings per year for ewes in the Zhihe Brigade. Han Jicai, the first secretary of the commune party committee, personally led the experiment, and Secretary Rilangjia (Tibetan) served as the head of the mating station. Herdsmen with good ideology and rich experience were selected to manage the experimental sheep flocks, and training classes were held to train estrus induction and mating personnel. A research office was established to manufacture estrus-inducing agents. Initially, some people, constrained by old habits of thousands of years, doubted this new thing everywhere. When estrus induction personnel injected estrus-inducing agents into ewes after lambing, some said, "Estrus in livestock cannot be induced by humans." When the ewes were indeed in heat, they said it was "fake estrus and cannot be mated." These arguments did not shake the confidence of the vast number of commune members under the leadership of the Party. They carefully fed and managed the ewes, which grew very well, and the lambs born were all strong and healthy.
    The natural conditions of the Zhihe Brigade are not superior, with an altitude of 3,000 to 3,500 meters and a relatively cold climate. There are many mountains and gullies in the pasture. The commune members believe that the large flocks of ewes producing two lambs a year and three lambs in two years are proof of the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune system. Because the people's commune is large and public, with abundant manpower and material resources, it can select excellent herdsmen, allocate better pastures, concentrate strong ewes, and have the strength to carry out various research work and manufacture estrus-inducing agents.
    The achievements of the Zhihe Brigade have greatly encouraged the herdsmen of all ethnic groups on the Qinghai grasslands. The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China affirmed the successful experience of the Zhihe Brigade and called on all communes in the province to "learn from Zhihe, catch up with Zhihe, and surpass Zhihe." A mass competition movement to strive for two lambs per year or three lambs in two years for ewes has spread across the vast grasslands. (Yang Liben)
    (Reported by this newspaper) In the Meili Management Area of the Xiansheng Commune in Zhongwei County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, 23 precious Bai Sha wool ewes produced a total of 154 lambs in sixteen months. These 23 ewes gave birth once in November 1958, underwent heat mating after lambing, and gave birth a second time in May and June of last year. These two times they produced a total of 93 lambs. Except for some sheep that gave birth to three lambs in one litter, other ewes gave birth to twins each time. In February and March of this year, they gave birth for the third time, producing a total of 49 lambs. Among them, one ewe gave birth to three lambs, one ewe gave birth to four lambs, and the rest gave birth to twins. At the same time, among the lambs born in November 1958, six small ewes also "doubled in glory" at this time, giving birth to twelve second-generation lambs. These 23 ewes have produced three litters and two generations in just over a year, totaling 154 lambs, achieving continuous twin litters and multiple births, with high yields and abundant production.
    The experience of the commune members in the Meili Management Area in cultivating the "twin litter multiple birth high-yield flock" is a great inspiration: once people grasp the objective laws of livestock production, they can fully utilize them to achieve high-speed development in animal husbandry production. In the autumn of 1958, the Party General Branch of the Meili Management Area of the Xiansheng People's Commune mobilized the masses to establish ambitious goals and create twin litter multiple birth records. Initially, when this issue was discussed among the herdsmen, some people said, "It is a matter of course for sheep to produce one litter a year. We have been herding sheep all our lives and have never heard of twin litter multiple births in one year." However, a group of herdsmen with advanced ideas, represented by the youth Ding Xin, enthusiastically supported this matter.
    Thanks to the concern of Party organizations at all levels, herdsmen like Ding Xin carefully fed the sheep under their management, and all 23 ewes gave birth to twins in winter.
    Based on the experience of Ding Xin and other herdsmen that "twin lambs can produce twin lambs," the Party General Branch further studied and found that ewes that give birth to twins or multiple lambs were originally twin lambs themselves. Therefore, they began to realize that utilizing the genetic properties of twin lambs, strengthening grazing management, and implementing two-litter mating can ensure that twin lambs produce twin or multiple lambs in each generation. Later, the twin lambs were concentrated into one flock, strengthened management, and experimented with.
    After achieving twin litter multiple births, new contradictions arose. How to ensure that the lambs grow well and the adult sheep are not weak became a new issue. There was another debate on this issue. Some people said:
  "Once spring comes, the sheep are so weak that they can't even walk. How can they nurse twin lambs?" The Party General Branch was determined to break with convention and support Ding Xin and others in doing everything possible to raise twin lambs well. Not only did the lambs develop well, but the 23 ewes were also plump and fat, and became pregnant with winter lambs again.
    During this year's winter lambing, two new situations were discovered: one was that 13 of the previously single-lamb ewes also gave birth to twins; the other was that two of the ewes that gave birth to twins last year gave birth to three lambs, and one gave birth to four lambs. The herdsmen believe that ewes that were originally single-lambs, if mated with twin-lamb rams, are likely to give birth to twins; twin-lamb ewes, after careful breeding, are also likely to give birth to three or four lambs. The commune party committee and the Party General Branch, in the spirit of continuous revolution, studied these new situations and made further plans to cultivate twin-litter multiple-birth high-yield flocks. On the one hand, they are preparing to use methods such as artificial insemination, double mating, and repeated mating to test how to improve the multiple-birth performance of twin-lamb ewes; on the other hand, they are selecting strong, good-wool ewes from the single-lamb ewes to form a breeding flock, equipped with twin-lamb rams, so that twin lambs also appear in large numbers among the single-lamb ewes.

    母羊高产有了新经验
    青海过马营公社直核大队大群绵羊年产两胎
    宁夏先声公社美利管理区山羊群连年双胎多产
    本报讯　能不能打破母羊一年只产一胎的常规，做到一年两胎或两年三胎，促使畜牧业更高速度地发展呢？青海省海南藏族自治州贵南县过马营公社经过两年试验，得到了肯定的回答。过马营公社在直核大队集中一千五百零五只四岁到六岁的母绵羊，于1958年7月配种，到11、12月产羔一千五百零六只，产后紧跟着进行了人工催情和热胎配种，到1959年5月又产羔五百一十二只，两次共产羔二千零一十八只，成活二千零四只，在一年左右的时间内繁殖成活率达到133％以上；特别值得重视的是，其中模范放牧员格日（藏族）经管的羊群繁殖成活率超过188％，基本上达到只只母羊年产两胎。到今年2月底，这七个试验群又产羔一千二百五十四只，成活一千二百四十九只。这样，从1958年7月到1960年2月的二十个月当中，这些母羊先后三次共产羔三千二百七十二只，成活三千二百五十三只。这件事情说明，采用人工催情、热胎配种的办法促使母羊一年两胎或两年三胎，是高速度发展绵羊生产的一个重要方向。
    前年秋天，过马营公社决定在直核大队大搞母羊一年两产的试验。公社党委第一书记韩积才亲自领导试验，书记日郎加（藏族）当配种站站长，抽调思想好、经验多的放牧员管理试验羊群，并举办训练班培养催情配种员，成立研究室制造催情药剂。起初，有的人由于受千百年来的旧习惯的束缚，对这种新事物处处发生怀疑。当催情配种员给产后母羊注射催情剂时，有人说：“牲畜发情不由人催”。母羊千真万确发情了，他们又说是“假发情，配不上”。这些议论丝毫没有动摇党领导下的广大社员的信心。他们精心饲养管理，母羊膘长得很好，生下的羔羊只只健壮。
    直核大队的自然条件并不优越，拔海三千到三千五百米，气候比较寒冷，草场上山多沟多。大群母羊年产两胎和两年三胎，社员们都认为是人民公社制度的无比优越性的明证。因为人民公社一大二公，人力物力雄厚，就能够挑选优秀的放牧员，划出较好的草场，集中健壮母畜，同时有力量进行各种研究工作和制造催情药剂。
    直核大队的成就大大鼓舞了青海草原上的各族牧民。中共青海省委肯定了直核大队的成功经验，并向全省各公社提出了“学直核、赶直核、超直核”的号召，一个争取母羊年产两胎或两年三胎的群众性竞赛运动，就在辽阔的草原上扩展开来。　（杨立本）
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区中卫县先声公社美利管理区有二十三只名贵的白沙毛母山羊，在十六个月的时间内，共产羔一百五十四只。这二十三只母羊，在1958年11月产羔一次，产后进行热胎配种，到去年5、6月产了第二次，这两次共产羔九十三只，除有的羊一胎产了三羔，其他母羊每次都产了双羔，到今年2、3月，又第三次生产，共产羔四十九只，其中有一只母羊下了三羔，一只母羊下了四羔，其余的都下了双羔；同时，1958年11月产下的羊羔中，有六只小母羊也在这时“双生贵子”，产下了二代羊羔十二只。这二十三只母山羊，在一年多的时间里已产三槎、两代，共一百五十四只小羊，达到连年双槎多羔，高额丰产。
    美利管理区社员们培育“双槎多羔高产群”的经验，是个伟大的启示：人们一旦掌握了家畜生产的客观规律，便能充分加以利用，使畜牧业生产获得高速度的发展。1958年秋季先声人民公社美利管理区党总支发动群众树雄心，立大志，创造双槎多羔纪录。最初在牧工中讨论这个问题时，有人说：“羊只一年产一次羔是天经地义的事。我们放了一辈子羊，从来也没听说过一年双槎多羔。”但是，以青年丁信为代表的一部分具有先进思想的牧工却热情拥护这件事。
    由于各级党组织的关心，牧工丁信等对自己负责管理的羊群精心喂养，二十三只母羊到冬季都生了双羔。
    根据丁信等牧工创造的“对对小羊就能生对对小羔”的经验，党总支进一步研究，发现凡是生双羔或多羔的母羊，原来也都是双胎羊，于是开始认识到利用双羔羊的遗传性能，加强放牧管理，实行两槎配种，就可以保证双胎羊代代双羔或多羔。后来就把双羔羊集中一群，加强管理，进行试验。
    实现双槎多羔以后，新的矛盾又发生了。如何保证羔羊长得好，大羊不乏瘦，是一个新课题。对这个问题又发生了争论，有人说：
  “一到春季羊乏得路都走不动，还能奶双羔？”党总支决心打破陈规，支持丁信等千方百计养好双羔。不仅羔羊发育得好，而且二十三只母羊也膘满肉肥，并又怀上了冬羔。
    在今年产冬羔中，又发现了两种新情况：一个是过去的单羔母羊有十三只也生了双羔；另一个是去年生双羔的母羊有两只生了三羔，还有一只生了四羔。牧工们认为，原来是单羔的母羊，用双羔种公羊配了种，就有可能生双羔；双羔母羊经过精心培育，又有可能生三羔或四羔。公社党委和党总支本着不断革命的精神，研究了这些新的情况，作出了进一步培育双槎多羔高产群的规划。一方面准备采用人工授精、双重配、复配等方法，试验如何提高双羔母羊的多产性能；另一方面，从产单羔的母羊中选拔体格壮、毛路好的组成选育群，配备双羔种羊，使单羔母羊中也大量出现双羔。
