The Beijing Urban People's Commune is being established step by step in batches. This is a great happy event that the people of the capital have been longing for; this is the historical trend that the people want and expect. The mass movement, which is coming on with great force, excites the hearts of the people of the capital, excites the hearts of the literary and artistic circles of Beijing, and encourages the creative enthusiasm of the literary and artistic circles of Beijing. Under the leadership of the Party, the literary and artistic circles of Beijing have launched a mass creative upsurge. Within a short week, they created and performed 68 large and small programs of drama, music, dance, and folk art praising the urban people's commune, which can form six or seven large-scale evening parties. Fine arts also took the urban people's commune as the theme at the fastest speed, and created more than 270 traditional Chinese paintings, sketches, and propaganda posters within a week. The film also shot documentaries and newsreels. These works, to a certain extent, reflect the people's wishes and vividly express the inevitable trend of the establishment of the urban people's commune as "water flows into a canal and melons fall off when ripe." These works are full of vigorous revolutionary atmosphere, and new things and new characters have formed a new style in this creation, thus winning the praise of the broad masses of the people in the capital. The victory of this mass creation movement is the victory of the Party's general line on the literary and artistic front, and the victory of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought.

This mass creation movement fully proves that literary and artistic creation can also be done more, faster, better, and more economically. So many works praising the urban people's commune were created in a week, including short and concise ones, as well as medium and large ones, the latter accounting for a considerable number. Some works have portrayed relatively distinct images of advanced figures, such as the drama "Ten Thousand Families Welcome Spring" performed by the Beijing Film Actors Troupe, and "Commune Flowers Bloom for Happiness" performed by the China Pingju Opera Theater, etc. They reflect the strong desire of the vast number of women to get rid of housework and participate in socialist construction. The establishment of the People's Commune has realized the wishes of women and liberated them. After participating in production, they are full of revolutionary drive in their production posts. The heroic images of women in this new era portrayed in many works have left a deep impression on the audience. These works not only quickly reflect reality, but also have high ideological and artistic qualities. These works also have the characteristics of being loved by the broad masses of the people. Facts have proved that as long as literary and art workers are full of revolutionary vigor, throw themselves into the fiery revolutionary struggle, and share the same breath with the working people, a prosperous scene of more, faster, better, and more economical creation will appear.

The mass movement is the driving force for promoting all revolutionary undertakings, the revolutionary driving force that is invincible. Wherever the masses are boldly mobilized, unexpected miracles will appear, and a vigorous and enthusiastic scene will appear. This is the truth proved by revolutionary practice. The victory of the literary and artistic creation in Beijing this time, which quickly reflected the urban people's commune, is the victory of breaking superstitions and mobilizing the masses. Most of the more than 300 works created in a week were created by mobilizing the masses in various literary and art groups, and were created by a large number of masses while participating in the communization movement, while creating, rehearsing, and performing. Relatively excellent programs such as the drama "Ten Thousand Families Welcome Spring", the folk art "Red Courtyard", "Starting from Scratch", the Pingju Opera "Commune Flowers Bloom for Happiness", the song and dance "People's Commune Flowers Bloom", "Sisters Run Factories" and other relatively excellent programs were created in this way. Facts have also proved that, under the leadership of the Party, the combination of experts and the masses to carry out mass movements is the best way to prosper literary and artistic creation.

Revolutionary literature and art is a part of the entire revolutionary cause, like the gears and screws of a machine. It should be subordinate to the revolutionary task. This is the fundamental principle of revolutionary literature and art. Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" clearly pointed out to us the relationship between literature and art and revolution: "Literature and art are subordinate to politics, but in turn give great influence to politics." This creative movement vividly proves that only when literature and art reflect the people's wishes and are closely combined with the current politics, can the people care about it, the people will love it, and literature and art will have a stronger vitality. The works created this time are a reflection of the rich life created by the people, and are a promotion of the establishment of the urban people's commune. When literary and art workers send these works to the door in a timely manner, they in turn have a great influence on the urban people's commune and the broad masses of the people in the capital. These works are combined with the great events that the people care most about, intertwined with the people's thoughts and feelings, and resonated, so these works are warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people in the capital. Therefore, every time they are sent to the door for performance, most of the programs have to be sung again, and some are even replayed several times. They said, "Your timely arrival is a great encouragement to us." The encouragement of the Party and the welcome of the masses also encouraged the creative enthusiasm of the actors. These vivid examples vividly tell us that the working people create life and promote creation, and creation in turn affects the people's thoughts and feelings. They encourage each other and improve each other, so that literature and art have a flesh-and-blood relationship with the people. These examples also profoundly illustrate the relationship between literature and art and the masses. Literary and art workers must combine with the masses and throw themselves into the fiery struggle life in order to obtain creative sources, correctly reflect the people's life, and create works that are truly welcomed by the people.

The great and rich life content of social leap forward and the establishment of urban people's communes should be expressed in various art forms. This is the responsibility of literary and art workers and the requirement of the people. This time, the literary and artistic circles in Beijing enthusiastically shouldered this task. Literary and art workers used various art forms to reflect the same great theme of the urban people's commune; the great theme and fresh content also enriched various art forms. For example, ancient Kunqu Opera, Peking Opera, Hebei Bangzi and other operas also participated in this creative movement and played their fighting role. They created nineteen programs: such as the large chorus of the Chinese Opera School: "Ode to the People's Commune", the Mei Opera Troupe's "Singing Loudly and Advancing Bravely", the Chinese Peking Opera Theater's "Triple Happiness", the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe's "Red Flag Glass Factory", the Northern Kunqu Opera Theater's "The City is Full of Red Flowers Welcoming the Sun", the Beijing Hebei Bangzi Opera Troupe's "Singing the People's Commune", etc., all used different forms to express this great theme, and they fully used the special skills of combining doing, reading, singing, and dancing to express the real great life content; the new content also prompted them to reform and break through their performance programs. For example, in the Peking Opera chorus, the combination of Peking Opera singing and chanting, dancing and reciting poetry, has new creations in performance and music, enriching the performance form of opera and enhancing the vitality and combat effectiveness of opera performance.

Drama, music, dance, folk art, Pingju Opera, painting, and film, these art forms that are easier to reflect reality, have played a greater fighting role in this mass creation movement.

This mass creation movement in Beijing's literary and art circles to cooperate with the publicity of the urban people's commune has been welcomed and encouraged by the broad masses of the people in the capital. It reflects the new face of the Beijing literary and art team after the rectification and study. This is the continuation of the great leap forward in 1958 and the continued great leap forward in 1959, showing the fighting spirit of the literary and art team. However, socialist construction is advancing by leaps and bounds, and literary and art workers should not be complacent because of this, but should further keep up with the development of the times on the basis of the achievements they have made, continue to leap forward, and use our strongest voice to sing praises to our great era!

    奏出伟大时代的最强音
    张梦庚
    北京城市人民公社正在逐步分批地建立起来，这是首都人民盼望已久的大喜事；这是人心所向，众望所归的历史趋势。来势极猛的群众运动，激动着首都人民的心弦，激动着北京市文艺界的心弦，鼓舞了北京市文艺界的创作热情。北京市的文艺界在党的领导下掀起了群众性的创作热潮，在短短的一周内就创作、演出了歌颂城市人民公社的戏剧、音乐、舞蹈、曲艺大小节目六十八个，可以组成六、七个大型的晚会。美术也用最快的速度以城市人民公社为主题，一周内创作出了国画、速写、宣传画二百七十多幅。电影还拍摄了纪录片和新闻简报。这些作品在一定程度上反映了人民的愿望，形象地表现了“水到渠成、瓜熟蒂落”城市人民公社建立的必然趋势。这些作品充满着生气勃勃的革命气息，新事物、新人物形成了这次创作上的新风格，因而博得了首都广大人民的赞扬。这次群众创作运动的胜利，是党的总路线在文艺战线上的胜利，是毛主席文艺思想的胜利。
    这次群众创作运动完全证明了文艺创作也能多、快、好、省。在一周内创作出这么多歌颂城市人民公社的作品，其中有短小精悍的，也有中、大型的，后者还占了相当数量。有的作品刻划出了比较鲜明的先进人物形象，如北京电影演员剧团演出的话剧“万家春”，中国评剧院演出的“公社花开幸福来”等，它们反映了广大的妇女想摆脱家务劳动，参加社会主义建设的强烈愿望。人民公社的建立实现了妇女们的愿望，使她们得到了解放。她们参加生产以后，在生产岗位上充满着革命干劲。不少作品中刻划出的这些新时代的妇女英雄形象，给观众留下了深刻的印象。这些作品不但迅速地反映了现实，而且有很高的思想性和较高的艺术性。这些作品还都具备着被广大人民喜闻乐见的特点。事实证明：文艺工作者只要充满革命的朝气，投身到 火热的革命斗争中去，同劳动人民共呼吸，就会在创作上出现多快好省的繁荣景象。
    群众运动是推动一切革命事业的动力，是无坚不摧的革命的动力，哪里放手发动群众，哪里就会出现意想不到的奇迹，就会出现朝气勃勃、热气腾腾的繁荣局面，这是革命实践证明了的真理。北京市文艺界这次迅速反映城市人民公社的文艺创作的胜利，就是破除迷信、发动群众取得的胜利。这次在一周内创作出来的三百多件作品，绝大部分是各文艺团体发动群众创作的，是大批群众边参加公社化运动、边创作、边排练、边演出创作出来的作品。话剧“万家春”、曲艺“红大院”、“白手起家”、评剧“公社花开幸福来”、歌舞“人民公社鲜花开”、“姐妹办工厂”等比较优秀的节目，就是这样创作出来的。事实也说明了，在党的领导下，专家与群众相结合大搞群众运动是繁荣文艺创作最好的方法。
    革命的文艺是整个革命事业的一部分，就像一部机器的齿轮和螺丝钉一样，它应该服从于革命任务，这是革命文艺的根本原则。毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”所说的“文艺是从属于政治的，但又反转来给予伟大的影响于政治”，给我们明确地指出了文艺与革命的关系。这次的创作运动生动地证明了文艺只有反映了人民的愿望，只有同当前的政治紧密地结合在一起的时候，人民才能关心它，人民才会热爱它，文艺才会具有更强大的生命力。这次创作出的作品，是人民创造的丰富生活的反映，是城市人民公社建立的推动。文艺工作者把这些作品及时地送上门去，又反转来给予首都城市人民公社和广大人民极大的影响。这些作品与人民最关心的伟大事件结合在一起，与人民的思想感情交织在一起，发生了共鸣，因此这些作品受到首都广大人民热烈的欢迎。因此，每次送上门演出时，大部分节目都要重演唱一遍，有的甚至重演几次。他们说，“你们及时下来，对我们的鼓舞太大了”。党的鼓励、群众的欢迎又鼓舞着演员的创作热情。这些活生生的实例生动地告诉我们：劳动人民创造了生活推动着创作，创作又影响着人民的思想感情。互相鼓舞着相互提高，使文艺与人民有了血肉的感情。这些实例也深刻地说明了文艺与群众的关系，文艺工作者必须与群众相结合，投身到火热的斗争生活中去，才能取得创作源泉，才能正确地反映出人民的生活，才能创作出真正受人民欢迎的作品。
    社会飞跃前进和城市人民公社建立的伟大丰富的生活内容，应该在各种艺术形式中表现出来，这是文艺工作者的责任，也是人民的要求。这次北京市文艺界热情地担负起了这一任务，文艺工作者们以各种不同的艺术形式，反映着城市人民公社这同一的伟大主题；伟大的主题，新鲜的内容也丰富了各种艺术形式。如古老的昆曲、京剧、河北梆子等剧种也参加了这次创作运动，发挥了它们的战斗作用，它们创作出了十九个节目：如中国戏曲学校的大联唱：“歌颂人民公社”、梅剧团的“高歌猛进”、中国京剧院的“三喜临门”、北京京剧团的“红旗玻璃厂”、北方昆曲剧院的“满城红花迎太阳”、北京河北梆子剧团的“歌唱人民公社”等，都运用了不同的形式表现这一伟大的主题，它们充分地运用了做、念、唱、舞相结合的特长来表现现实伟大的生活内容；新的内容也促使着它们改革，突破了它们的表演程式。如京剧大联唱中京剧的唱与念、舞与朗诵诗相结合的表演与音乐都有了新的创造，丰富戏曲的表演形式，增强了戏曲表演的生命力、战斗力。
    话剧、音乐、舞蹈、曲艺、评剧、绘画、电影这些更易于反映现实的艺术形式，在这次群众创作运动中，更加发挥了它们的战斗作用。
    北京市文艺界这次配合城市人民公社宣传的群众创作运动，受到了首都广大人民的欢迎和鼓舞，它反映北京市文艺队伍在整风学习后的新面貌，这是继1958年大跃进和1959年的继续大跃进，表现出了文艺队伍的战斗精神。但是，社会主义建设在飞跃地前进，文艺工作者不能因此自满，而应该在既得成绩的基础之上，进一步跟上时代的发展，继续跃进，用我们的最强音来歌颂我们这个伟大的时代！
