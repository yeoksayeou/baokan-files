Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:
	I wholeheartedly endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft, and I also fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
	In 1959, China's socialist cause, on the basis of the unprecedented Great Leap Forward in 1958, achieved a sustained and even greater leap forward. After listening to the reports of the Vice Premiers and the speeches of the representatives at the meeting, I am very excited. The speed of China's national economic leap forward is astonishing, and the achievements are brilliant. These great victories were obtained by the people of the whole country under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant light of the general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, with soaring energy, and by carrying out a vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy. I wholeheartedly support the general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune. They are the three magic weapons for developing socialist construction, and they have made life in China boil over. The liberated productive forces are running at full speed at an astonishing rate. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, with these three magic weapons, we will surely, in a not-too-long period of time, build our country into a great socialist country with highly-developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, and finally realize the lofty ideal of communism.
	Here I would like to express some opinions only on the land reclamation that I have visited.

	The Motherland's Borderlands, Fertile Plains
	Under the illumination of the Party's general line, China's land reclamation cause, like other construction undertakings, is developing vigorously at a leaping pace. Last May, I visited the land reclamation area, which people habitually call "Great Northern Wilderness," with Minister Wang Zhen of the Ministry of Land Reclamation and Representative Tao Zhiyue.
	The reclamation area is located in the eastern part of Heilongjiang Province, adjacent to our great ally, the Soviet Union. This area has vast land, fertile soil, abundant resources, and beautiful scenery. When we arrived, it was the turn of spring and summer. The Wanda Mountains, which stretch across the middle of the reclamation area, were lush green. The large tracts of wilderness after the melting of ice and snow were like brocade, and the scenery was picturesque everywhere. There is an endless layer of black soil with excellent soil quality. The black soil layer can be as deep as three feet. In some places, the peat layer reaches twenty to thirty centimeters. After being reclaimed and turned over, it is a good fertilizer after burning. The humus layer contains a lot of nitrogen and phosphorus, which is suitable for planting rice, wheat, corn, especially soybeans. The swamps and rivers in the reclamation area can be irrigated and used for power generation after dredging. Various kinds of fish are also abundant in the rivers and ponds, especially the famous chum salmon, which has a large output and delicious meat. The Wanda Mountains, which run through the east and west of the reclamation area, are rich in natural resources. In addition to gold, silver, and iron, the reserves of coal and oil shale are estimated to be very large. In the virgin forests that have never been logged, there are more than a dozen kinds of precious trees, such as pine, oak, birch, and Amur cork tree, which are important materials for construction. The forests also grow precious medicinal materials such as ginseng, and precious foods such as monkey head mushrooms, mushrooms, and fungus. In addition, there are also various wild animals such as tigers, leopards, deer, bears, wolves, wild boars, raccoon dogs, otters, and roe deer for hunting.
	The borderland of the motherland is such a fertile and colorful land. However, before liberation, the reactionary ruling classes of all dynasties only cared about exploiting and oppressing the people, and never developed or would develop this area. As a result, these fertile and resource-rich lands have always been sleeping. In winter, they are covered with snow and ice, and in spring and summer, they are covered with weeds and barrenness. Therefore, people named it "Great Northern Wilderness." The wilderness has always been the wilderness, and the fertile land has become a place for weeds and wild animals. After liberation, under the guidance of the Party's policy of actively developing the borderlands, the so-called "Great Northern Wilderness" began to change its old face and put on new clothes. One farm after another appeared in succession. The sound of tractors startled away the wild animals living there. The wasteland covered with thorns began to turn into fertile fields with rolling wheat waves. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Great Northern Wilderness reclamation area has undergone unprecedented and tremendous changes. Although our visit this time was only one month, and the areas we visited were limited, what we saw and heard, whether it was the large-scale farms and livestock farms that had been built, or the reclamation areas that were being reclaimed, the automated large-scale factories that had been established, or the construction sites that were being built and expanded, everywhere was a leap forward sound, filled with the labor enthusiasm of the working people building the borderlands. Under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, people put "doing" first, had a strong will, and there appeared a vigorous mass agricultural production movement that shook the wilderness, and achieved a bumper harvest. It no longer gives people the feeling of "wilderness." What we see is a scene of prosperity everywhere. In socialist construction, the "Great Northern Wilderness" is leaping forward at a speed of one day equals twenty years, and the working people are drawing extremely beautiful and moving pictures on this "blank paper" that has been idle for many years.

	"Great Northern Wilderness" Has Become "Great Northern Granary"
	Under the correct leadership of the Party, the development and construction of the "Great Northern Wilderness" has made considerable progress in recent years; especially under the illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, there has emerged a new situation of continuous leap forward with greater and greater energy and higher and higher production. In 1958, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward in the whole country, the land reclamation area achieved amazing results in both agricultural production and construction. In the spring of this year, the officers and soldiers of the local garrison responded to the Party's call to go up the mountains and down to the countryside to participate in production and labor, which greatly strengthened the construction force of the land reclamation area. Under the leadership of the Party, they emancipated their minds, aroused soaring energy, and put forward the heroic slogan of "declaring war on the earth and ordering the wasteland to contribute grain." Regardless of the arduous living conditions and the cold weather, they cut through thorns and worked day and night to fight against nature, overcome numerous difficulties, and wrote exciting poems with their laboring hands for the construction of the borderlands and for the socialist construction cause of the motherland. In 1959, on the basis of the leap forward in 1958, the land reclamation areas achieved another great leap forward in agricultural production. They adhered to putting politics in command, and specifically implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture proposed by Chairman Mao, launched a mass movement on a large scale, and, with the firm will of "man will conquer nature," overcame various natural disasters and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production. For example, the Mudanjiang reclamation area had built sixteen general farms, seventy-eight branch farms, and more than five hundred production teams by 1959. The number of employees had developed to more than 180,000. The cultivated area reclaimed in the past two years has reached more than 6 million mu; the sown area in 1959 increased by 65.7% compared with 1958; and the total grain output in 1959 reached 357,000 tons. The total output of grain and beans increased by 2.57 times compared with 1958, and the yield per mu also increased significantly. A large area of high-yielding fields appeared. The area with a yield of more than 300 jin per mu for soybeans alone was 74,081 mu, and the highest yield per mu reached 700 jin. Sideline production has also been greatly developed. At the end of 1959, the number of pigs in stock reached more than 114,000, more than 28,000 horses and cattle, and 3.2 million poultry. Another example is the Hejiang reclamation area (we only visited a part of it). They only started building farms in 1958. In 1959, the sown area reached 2.65 million mu, and the total output of grain and beans reached 220,000 tons. Among them, the Ninth Branch Farm of Luobei Farm was expanded on the basis of a production team in August 1958. In 1959, the farm sowed 51,960 mu, and the annual harvest of grain and beans was 8,293,800 jin. Each agricultural worker was responsible for cultivating 522 mu of land, and produced 83,271 jin of grain and beans. In these land reclamation areas, we can see people working hard for the motherland's agricultural production everywhere, and everywhere is a scene of bumper harvest of "rolling wheat waves and fragrant bean flowers."
	These land reclamation areas are not only agricultural and animal husbandry commodity bases, but also industries are developing rapidly. The farms in each land reclamation area, under the principle of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, are gradually establishing a slightly scaled industrial system in combination with their own production needs. The entire land reclamation area has built and put into production more than 260 large, medium and small industrial and mining enterprises, such as flour processing, winemaking, ore, coke, ferroalloy, machine tool, papermaking, cement, petroleum, leather, chemical fertilizer, brick and tile, and machinery repair, with more than 100 kinds of industrial products.
	With the development of production, the transportation, culture, education, health and welfare undertakings in the reclamation area have also been significantly improved. Transforming the wilderness into towns, and transforming desolation into prosperity. In terms of transportation, there are very good highways. In August 1957, the workers themselves built a railway of several hundred kilometers, from Mishan directly to Yingchun, the timber concentration area, and eastward to Hutou, which will connect the Sino-Soviet border in 1960. Shipping from Raohe and Hutou can reach Jiamusi via the Ussuri River. In terms of culture, education and health, there are two universities and more than 60 middle and primary schools in the whole area. These schools correctly implement the Party's principle of combining education and labor production, and have cultivated a large number of talents who are both red and expert. The "850" farm alone has a central hospital with more than 300 beds, branch farms have thirteen health stations, and each production team has health personnel and midwives. The whole area has an amateur cultural troupe, and each general farm and branch farm has an amateur cultural team. There are also more than 30 film projection teams, which tour the branch farms and production teams.

	The Borderlands are Vast and Rich, and There is a Lot of Wasteland to be Reclaimed
	The borderlands of the motherland are very vast, and there is still a lot of wasteland that has not been reclaimed. The cause of prospering the borderlands still requires our continued efforts. The situation in the Mudanjiang reclamation area can illustrate this problem. This reclamation area has a cultivable wasteland area of ​​about 15 million mu (the Hejiang reclamation area also has the same large cultivable area), and now only more than 6 million mu have been reclaimed. The temperature is not as cold as people say. The average annual temperature is two to four degrees Celsius. The average temperature in the coldest January is only around minus nineteen degrees Celsius. The frost-free period throughout the year is about 130 days, and general crops are completely suitable for growth, and are more suitable for mechanized farming. If we further develop and expand the cultivated area, improve the water conservancy, increase the irrigated area, and develop all the wasteland into fertile land, and carry out mechanized farming, this fertile land will produce a very considerable amount of food and soybeans for the people, and become a more prosperous "granary."
	The virgin forest of Wanda Mountain is quite vast and dense, which can provide the country with a large amount of precious timber. The value of afforestation and mining is very high. In the winter of 1958, in order to support the construction of the capital, the reclamation area mobilized an army of 30,000 lumberjacks, 200 tractors, and 150 cars, and completed the task of felling 2 million cubic meters of timber in a short time. The timber production here is very large. The railway built by the Land Reclamation Bureau is close to the forest farm. Even in the case of winter freezing, it is very convenient to use snow and ice for transportation.
	The grassland in this reclamation area is very good, and there are many swamps. More than 20 reservoirs and more than 100 ponds and dams have been built in the north and south of Wanda Mountain. It is very suitable for raising livestock, poultry, and fish, and it seems to have great potential. In addition, the agricultural and animal husbandry processing industry and light and heavy industries, as well as the exploration and exploitation of underground resources in this area, also have broad prospects with the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production.
	China's border areas are vast and rich. In addition to Heilongjiang Province, I have been to the Manas River bank farm in the Junggar Basin of the Xinjiang reclamation area. In recent years, the yield per mu of grain has increased year by year, especially the cotton has increased faster. Although this area is a Gobi desert, it can be turned into an oasis as long as there is water, and it can be turned into fertile land after alkali washing. It is not only suitable for crops, but also suitable for livestock. There are also the reclamation areas in southern Xinjiang and the Turpan reclamation area, which have achieved great achievements in agricultural and animal husbandry production, and there are also very good reclamation conditions there. The state-owned farms in Delingha, Golmud, Makai, and Xiaocaidan in Qinghai have carried out very good soil improvement, planting windbreak forests, opening canals, and making the land like gardens, which has also been very successful. These reclamation areas all implement the principle of focusing on agriculture and animal husbandry and comprehensively developing diversified operations, which not only continuously increases the yield per unit area, but also can continue to expand the cultivated area. In addition, the development work of building the borderlands in Hainan Island and Inner Mongolia is also developing vigorously, and has achieved remarkable achievements. Hainan Island and Yunnan have the development prospects of planting a large number of tropical and subtropical crops and cash crops. The most promising are rubber, oil, spices, medicinal materials, hard fiber, fruits and coffee. The agricultural workers there are holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, breaking superstitions and daring to think and act in the situation of the Great Leap Forward, and concretely implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture in the production of these tropical plants. The rubber planted is growing very fast, which is even more encouraging. In recent years, countless young men and women and demobilized and transferred officers and soldiers of the armed forces in various parts of China, under the great call of the Party for socialist construction, have gone to the borderlands of the motherland to engage in production and construction with the labor enthusiasm for developing the borderlands. Their labor achievements are great, and they have written a glorious page in China's socialist construction cause.

	In 1960, agricultural production will achieve a comprehensive and better leap forward under the principle of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations. In order to better increase the production of grain and various cash crops, it is necessary to greatly increase the utilization rate of land, and implement the simultaneous expansion of the cultivated area, increase the multiple cropping area, and increase the yield per unit area. In expanding the cultivated area, China's border areas have extremely favorable reclamation conditions. The construction of the borderlands can not only greatly increase the grain production in these areas, but also prosper the economy of the border areas. Moreover, producing a large number of materials for the socialist industrialization construction of the motherland will further accelerate the high-speed development of China's national economy. Vice Premier Li Fuchun proposed in his report that in terms of basic agricultural construction, the area of land reclamation of state-owned farms will be expanded, and the construction of rubber farms will be strengthened, and it is required to further give play to the superiority of state-owned farms, so that state-owned farms can provide the state with more agricultural and livestock products. This is an extremely encouraging leap forward plan. The development prospect of our motherland's border areas is bright and beautiful. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we must hold high the red banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, and continue to strive to achieve a continued, comprehensive and better leap forward in the national economy in 1960. In implementing the task of developing the national economy this year, we must fully recognize that agriculture has an extremely important role in the development of the national economy, and it is the foundation of the national economy. The faster the development of agriculture, the faster it can guarantee the development of light industry, and it can also guarantee the priority development of heavy industry. I think that under the guidance of this policy, gradually utilizing all the vast and fertile land in the border areas of the country, turning all the wilderness into fertile fields, and turning the wasteland into granaries, has important political and economic significance, and is also in line with the spirit of Article 16 of the Agricultural Development Program, "reclaiming wasteland and expanding the cultivated area."
	1960 is an extremely important year for China's socialist cause, and it is also a year in which the national economy will continue to achieve a greater leap forward. It will make the socialist cause of the motherland develop comprehensively and rapidly, so that we can build socialism as soon as possible and move towards a bright and splendid communism.
	Please correct me if there is anything wrong with the above speech.

专栏：

    大量开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积
    曾泽生代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我衷心的拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，也完全同意全国人大常委会的工作报告。
    1959年，我国的社会主义事业在1958年空前大跃进的基础上，又实现了持续的更大的跃进。在会议中听了各位副总理的报告和代表们的发言，使我非常兴奋，我国国民经济跃进的速度是惊人的，取得的成就是辉煌的。这些伟大的胜利，是全国人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，鼓足了冲天的干劲，开展了轰轰烈烈的群众性的增产节约运动而获得的。我竭诚地拥护社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社，它是发展社会主义建设的三个法宝，它已使全中国的生活正在沸腾。解放了的生产力正在以惊人的速度开足马力向前飞跑。我们坚信在党和毛主席的领导下，有了这三个法宝，必定在不太长的时间内把我国建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大社会主义国家，并且在最后实现共产主义的崇高理想。
    这里我仅就参观过的农垦事业，发表一点意见。
    祖国的边疆，肥沃的原野
    在党的总路线的照耀下，我国农垦事业和其他建设事业一样，正以跃进的速度蓬勃的向前发展。去年5月我同农垦部王震部长，陶峙岳代表等参观过被人们习惯称为“北大荒”的农垦区。
    垦区位于黑龙江省东部，邻接我们伟大的盟邦苏联，这块地区土地辽阔、土质肥沃、资源丰富、风景优美。我们到时，正是春夏之交，绵亘于垦区中部的完达山脉，青葱如黛，冰雪消融后的大片原野绿茵似锦，到处风光如画，景色迷人。那里有无边无际土质优良的黑土层。黑土层厚可达三尺深。有些地方草炭层达二十到三十公分，开荒翻过来，经过燃烧处理就是良好的肥料。腐质层含氮含磷很多，适宜于水稻、小麦、玉米，尤其是大豆的种植。垦区沼泽与河流，经过疏浚即可灌溉和发电。江河池沼里还盛产各种鱼类，特别是有名的大蚂哈鱼，产量很大，肉质鲜美。横贯垦区东西的完达山脉，蕴藏着丰饶的自然资源。矿藏除金、银、铁外，煤及油母页岩，据估计储量也很大。在从来未采伐过的原始森林中，生长着松、柞、桦、黄菠萝等十几种名贵的树木，是建筑上的重要材料。森林内还生长着贵重的药材人参，名贵的食品猴头、蘑菇、木耳等。此外还有虎、豹、鹿、熊、狼、野猪、貉子、水獭、麅子等多种野兽，可供狩猎。
    祖国的边疆，如此沃壤，富饶多彩。可是在解放前，历代的反动统治阶级，只顾剥削压榨人民，从未开发过，也不会开发这块地区。致使这些肥沃、蕴藏丰富的土地，始终沉睡，冬季到处雪封冰冻，一片皑白，春夏则遍地荒草，满目荒芜，因此人们就给它起名叫做“北大荒”。原野始终是原野，肥沃的土地成为野草丛生、野兽驰居的场地。解放后，在党的积极开发边疆的方针指引下，过去所谓的“北大荒”才开始改变了旧有的面貌，披上了新装。一个个的农场接连出现，拖拉机声惊走了聚居的野兽，荆棘丛生的荒地开始变成麦浪滚滚的良田，尤其是自1958年大跃进以来，北大荒垦区更出现了空前未有的巨大变化。此次我们参观，虽然时仅一月，所到地区有限，但是所见所闻，无论是已建成的大规模的农场、畜牧场，或是正在开荒的垦区，已建立的自动化大型工厂或是正在兴建扩建的工地，到处是一片跃进声，洋溢着劳动人民建设边疆的劳动热情。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，人们“干”字当头，意志坚强，出现了一个轰轰烈烈震动原野的农业生产群众运动，并获得了大丰收。那里已不再使人有“荒”字的感觉，所见的是到处呈现繁荣昌盛的景象。在社会主义建设中，“北大荒”正以一天等于二十年的速度飞跃前进，劳动人民正在这张闲置多年的“白纸”上，绘出了极为美丽动人的图画。
    “北大荒”已变成了“北大仓”
    在党的正确领导下，“北大荒”的开发和建设，几年来已有长足的进展；尤其是在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，更出现了一个干劲越来越大，生产愈来愈高的连续跃进的新局面。1958年，在全国大跃进的形势下，农垦区无论在农业生产和建设方面都获得了惊人的成绩。这年春天，当地驻军官兵，响应党的上山下乡参加生产劳动的号召，来到了“北大荒”，大大增强了农垦区的建设力量。他们在党的领导下，解放思想，鼓起了冲天干劲，提出了“向地球开战，命荒地献粮”的豪迈口号。他们不顾生活条件的艰苦，不怕天寒地冻，披荆斩棘，日以继夜的向大自然作斗争，战胜重重的困难，用劳动的双手，为建设边疆，为祖国社会主义建设事业，写下了激动人心的诗篇。1959年，各垦区在1958年跃进的基础上，又实现了农业生产上的特大跃进。他们坚持政治挂帅，并具体的贯彻了毛主席提出的农业“八字宪法”，大搞群众运动，在“人定胜天”的坚定意志下，战胜了各种自然灾害，获得了农业生产空前大丰收。如牡丹江垦区，到1959年即建成十六个总场，七十八个分场，五百多个生产队，职工已发展到十八万多人，两年来开垦的耕地面积已达六百多万亩；1959年较1958年播种面积增长了65.7％；1959年粮食总产量达到三十五万七千吨。粮豆总产量较1958年增长二点五七倍，亩产量也有显著增长，出现了大面积丰产田，仅大豆一项，亩产三百斤以上者即有七万四千零八十一亩，最高的亩产达七百斤。副业生产也获得极大发展，1959年底猪的存栏数达到十一万四千多头，马牛二万八千多头，家禽三百二十万只。另如合江垦区（我们仅参观过一部分），他们在1958年才开始建场，在1959年播种面积即达二百六十五万亩，粮豆总产量达到二十二万吨，其中萝北农场九分场，是1958年8月在一个生产队的基础上扩建起来的，1959年全场播种五万一千九百六十亩，全年收粮豆八百二十九万三千八百斤，平均每个农工担负耕种土地五百二十二亩，生产粮豆达八万三千二百七十一斤。这些农垦区处处都见到人们为祖国农业生产而辛勤劳动，到处是“麦浪滚滚，豆花香”的丰收景象。
    这些农垦区不仅是一个农牧业商品基地，而且工业也在迅速发展，各垦区农场都在农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展的方针下，结合自己的生产需要，逐步的建立起稍具规模的工业体系，全垦区已经建成投入生产的有面粉加工、酿酒、矿石、焦炭、铁合金工作母机、造纸、水泥、石油、皮革、化肥、砖瓦、机械修配等各大中小型工矿企业二百六十多个，工业产品有一百多种。
    随着生产发展，垦区的交通运输、文教、卫生和生活福利事业，也有了显著的提高。变旷野为城镇，变荒凉为繁荣。交通方面有很好的公路，1957年8月职工们自己修通了几百公里的铁路，由密山直达木材集中地的迎春，向东将于1960年通中苏边境的虎头。航运由饶河、虎头，经乌苏里江可到佳木斯。在文教卫生方面全区有大学二所，中、小学六十多所。这些学校正确的贯彻了党的教育和劳动生产相结合的方针，培养了大批又红又专的人材。仅“八五零”一个农场，就设有三百多个床位的中心医院，分场有十三个卫生所，各生产队有卫生人员和助产士。全区有一个业余文工团，各总场分场都有一个业余文工队。还有三十余个电影放映队，巡回在各分场、生产队放映。
    边疆辽阔富饶，待垦的荒地很多
    祖国的边疆甚为辽阔，未开垦的荒地还很多，繁荣边疆的事业尚须我们继续努力，从牡丹江垦区的情况看，即可说明这一问题。这个垦区有可耕的荒地面积约一千五百多万亩（合江垦区也有同样大的可耕地面积），现在仅开垦六百多万亩。气温也不像人们所说那样寒冷，年平均气温为摄氏二到四度，最冷的1月份，平均气温也只有零下十九度附近，全年无霜期有一百三十天左右，一般农作物完全适于生长，更适宜机械化耕作。如果进一步发展，扩大耕地面积，把水利搞的更好一些，增大灌溉面积，把荒地都开拓成良田，进行机械耕作，这块肥沃的土地将会给人民生产数量极为可观的食粮、大豆，成为一个更加富饶的“米粮仓”。
    完达山的原始森林相当广阔而密茂，可以给国家提供大量的贵重木材，育林和开采的价值很大，1958年冬为支援首都建设，垦区动员了三万人的伐木大军，二百台拖拉机，一百五十辆汽车，短时即完成二百万立方米的伐木任务。这里的木材产量是很大的。农垦局修建的铁路已接近林场，即使在冬天封冻情况下，利用雪地和冰上运输，也很方便。
    这个垦区的草原很好，沼泽很多，在完达山南北，已筑起二十多个水库，一百多个塘坝，它很适于牧养牲畜，家禽和鱼类，看来潜力很大。还有，在这个区内的农牧加工工业和轻重工业，以及地下资源的勘测、开采等事业，也随着农牧业生产发展，有着广阔的前途。
    我国的边疆地区，辽阔富饶，除黑龙江省外，我到过的新疆垦区准噶尔盆地的玛纳斯河沿岸农场，几年来，粮食亩产年年增长，尤其是棉花增长得更快。这个地区虽然是戈壁沙漠，但它有水就能变绿洲，经过洗碱处理后即能变为良田。不仅适于农作物，也适于牧畜。还有南疆的垦区，吐鲁番垦区，都在农牧业生产上获得了很大的成就，那里还有很好的开垦条件。青海的德令哈、噶尔穆、马凯、小柴旦等区的国营农场，进行了很好的土壤改良，植防风林，开渠道、田园化，也做的非常成功。这些垦区都是贯彻以农牧业为主，全面发展多种经营的方针，不仅不断地提高了单位面积产量，而且还可以继续扩大耕地面积。此外如海南岛和内蒙古建设边疆的开发工作也正在蓬勃地发展，并且已获得显著的成就。海南岛和云南都具有大量种植热带和亚热带的农作物和经济作物的发展前途，最有希望的是橡胶、油料、香料、药材、硬质纤维、果品和咖啡等。那里的农工们高举着毛泽东的思想红旗，在大跃进的形势下，破除迷信，敢想敢干，把农业“八字宪法”具体贯彻于这些热带植物生产中，种植的橡胶成长得很快，更是振奋人心。几年来，我国各地无数青年男女和部队复员转业官兵，在党的社会主义建设的伟大号召下，怀着开发边疆的劳动热情，纷纷到祖国边疆从事生产建设，他们的劳动成果是巨大的，在我国社会主义建设事业中，写下了光辉的一页。
    1960年的农业生产在以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针下，将会实现全面的更好的跃进，为了更好地增产粮食和多种经济作物，必须大大提高土地利用率，实行扩大耕地面积、增加复种面积、提高单位面积产量同时并举。在扩大耕地面积上，我国边疆地区是具有极为有利的开垦条件的。对边疆的建设，不但可以大量增加这些地区的粮食，也能繁荣边疆地区的经济。而且，为祖国社会主义工业化建设生产大量物资，将更加加速我国国民经济的高速发展。李富春副总理在报告中提出在农业的基本建设方面，将扩大国营农场的垦荒面积，加强橡胶农场的建设，要求进一步发挥国营农场的优越性，使国营农场为国家提售更多的农产品和畜产品，这更是极为振奋人心的跃进规划。我们祖国的边疆地区，发展的前景是光明美好的。我们要在党和毛主席的英明领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，继续争取实现1960年的国民经济继续全面的更好的跃进，在贯彻执行今年发展国民经济的任务中，必须充分认识农业对于发展国民经济有着极端重要的作用，它是国民经济的基础。农业更快的发展了，不但可以保证轻工业更快的发展，而且可以保证重工业的优先发展。我想在这一方针指导下，把全国边疆地区的那些广阔肥沃的土地逐步都利用起来，让所有的旷野变成良田，使荒地变为粮仓，是有其重要的政治意义和经济意义，也是符合于农业发展纲要第十六条“开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积”的精神的。
    1960年是我国发展社会主义事业的极为重要的一年，也是国民经济将继续实现更大跃进的一年。将使祖国的社会主义事业全面的飞速发展，让我们早日建成社会主义，向光辉灿烂的共产主义迈进。
    以上发言是否有当，请代表们指正。
