Comrade Chen Yi, Vice Premier, dear comrades, dear friends:

    Please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks to the various organizations that organized this celebration of the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Hungary, and to extend my warm respects to the representatives of the people of Beijing, the beautiful capital of the People's Republic of China, who are attending this meeting.

    Fifteen years ago, on April 4, 1945, the working people of Hungary were liberated from the shackles of the German fascist bandits and their Hungarian lackeys, and embarked on the road of independent, autonomous, and free life due to the world-historically significant victory of the glorious Soviet Red Army.

    The history of the Hungarian working people is a history of the Hungarian working people's struggle against the cruel exploitation of the ruling class, against their betrayal of national interests to maintain this exploitation, and against foreign oppressors. The peasant uprising led by Dózsa György in 1514, the struggle against Turkish oppression and the four-hundred-year Austrian occupation, the bourgeois democratic revolution of 1848 which was carried out simultaneously with the struggle for national independence, and the proletarian revolution of 1919 are not only significant for the Hungarian nation, but also events of international significance, and they also inspired other oppressed nations.

    The thousand-year struggle of our working people finally triumphed on April 4, 1945, with the help of the Soviet Red Army. The historical military actions of the heroic Soviet army not only crushed fascism, but also realized the ideals that the Hungarian working people had dreamed of for generations, and left an indelible impression and deep gratitude in the minds of our people towards the Soviet people of all nationalities.

    In 1945, our working people took control of their own destiny under extremely difficult circumstances. At the time of liberation, our industry and agriculture, as a semi-feudal and semi-capitalist legacy, were extremely backward. Before liberation, in our country, which is extremely rich in resources and has good natural conditions, many people could not find jobs and had no means of livelihood. The number of unemployed often ranged between 300,000 and 800,000, while tens of thousands of people emigrated every year, wandering in every corner of the world. The large feudal landlord system weighed heavily on the country. 30% of the total cultivated land in the country was concentrated in the hands of large landowners who accounted for only 0.1% of the rural landowning population. At the same time, the 64% of the rural landowning population owned only 9.5% of the total cultivated land in the country. Most of these people could not make a living from the land and had to sell their labor to make a living, like the hundreds of thousands of people without land. The working people had no right to participate in state management. Culture and education were even more inaccessible to the working people. The great poet József Attila, who represented the poor, once described the infinitely impoverished life of workers and peasants before liberation in his poem "My Motherland":

    Thousands of different national diseases,
    Frequent infant deaths,
    The evils of the one-child system and poverty,
    Becoming orphans, premature aging,
    Mental illness, suicide, inexplicably
    Spiritually lazy, expecting miracles,
    All this is only to wake people up:
    We should be liberated from here!
    We should be in the working people's
    Intelligent meetings to understand the truth
    Discuss our hundreds of problems.

    The poet's wish has been realized. Liberation has brought fundamental changes to all areas of our people's society, economy, culture, and life. Under the leadership of the Hungarian Communist Party, the progressive forces of the country crushed the bourgeoisie's reserve positions after several years of resolute political struggle. The merger of the two workers' parties in Hungary in 1948 established the great unity of the Hungarian people. The first written constitution of the Hungarian people, the Constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic, promulgated in 1949, correctly asserted: "The Hungarian People's Republic is the state of Hungarian workers and working peasants."

    The children of the working people took control of the National Assembly and directly participated in the work of legislation and law enforcement through it and the 106,000 representatives of the local councils at all levels that were established later. In this way, the era in Hungary when laws were enacted and enforced without asking for the opinions of the working people and against their will is gone forever.

    At the time of liberation, the country's economic life was in a state of destruction. The criminal anti-Soviet war of the past ruling class brought losses equivalent to five years of national income. In other words, the fruits of five years of labor by our working people were destroyed. About 900,000 of our 9 million people died, were disabled, or lost all their labor power. Our livestock losses were 65%. A large part of the industrial equipment was stolen and transported to the West or destroyed. In Budapest alone, 100,000 homes were destroyed. Throughout the country, even the smallest bridges were blown up and railways were destroyed.

    In this situation, the Hungarian Communist Party, which had suffered serious losses in underground activities but had grown stronger in arduous struggles and had become one with the masses, issued a call to resume work and declared that through hard work our country could be built into a prosperous and happy country. The Party's promise has become a reality. Our country has been reborn, independent and free, and its economy is more developed than ever before. Our current industrial production is nearly four times that of 1938. After thoroughly eliminating dogmatic and revisionist views in our economic policy, the speed of industrial development has been particularly accelerated in the last two or three years. During these years, our industrial production has increased by 13%-14% annually. New cities have been born on the desolate grasslands, such as Sztálinváros with a population of 34,000, Komló with a population of 21,000, and Kazincbarcika, etc. While modernizing the original industrial sectors, many new industrial sectors have also been established. Its products have gained prestige for our working people all over the world.

    The land reform carried out in 1945 inspired the peasants, who actively participated in the construction. Our agricultural production in 1958 increased by 15% compared to the average annual output from 1934 to 1938, but at the same time, it can also be seen that the development of agricultural production lags behind the development of industry. While the development of industry under the system of ownership by the whole people is moving forward without any hindrance, agriculture is trapped in the constraints of small-scale land management, backward agricultural implements, and private land ownership. The development of industry, the popularization of cultural life, the electrification of the countryside, the application of modern agricultural machinery, and the appearance of radios and recently televisions in the countryside have all had a great impact on our working peasants. The example of peasants in the Soviet Union, China and other fraternal countries, as well as the achievements of the early agricultural cooperatives and state-owned farms, have proved to our peasants the superiority of collective production based on modern technology. Because our peasants recognize all this, especially their trust in the policies of the Party and the government, a cooperative movement has been launched that we have been able to witness since 1959 with such rapid growth. Only those who do not understand or are unwilling to understand the tremendous changes that have taken place in the lives and thoughts of Hungarian peasants will be surprised by the large-scale participation of the peasant masses in cooperatives. Today we can happily announce that more than 71.3% of our country's total cultivated land is socialist-type agricultural enterprises. There are 900,000 farmers in our agricultural production cooperatives, and most of the Hungarian countryside has become a socialist countryside. The newly established agricultural cooperatives are rapidly consolidating. Our agricultural cooperatives achieved good results last year. In 1959, our agricultural production increased by 7% compared to the previous year. These good results not only demonstrate the excellent labor of the newly joined farmers, but also demonstrate the assistance provided to us by the fraternal countries, especially the Soviet Union, with agricultural machinery. The year 1960 is a year of great significance in the life of our country. This is not only because in this year we will establish a higher starting point for the second five-year plan, but also because the socialist transformation of agriculture is mostly about to be completed before the start of the new five-year plan. We can confidently announce that the socialist system has finally triumphed in all areas of our country. We are not walking on one leg, but on two legs, socialist industry and socialist agriculture, on the road to building socialism.

    The past fifteen years have brought extremely profound changes to the lives of our working people. Today, our youth no longer know what tenant farmers and human trafficking are, nor do they know about receiving university diplomas and being unemployed, or blacklists, and other similar things. In the past, foreign countries called Horthy Hungary "the country of three million beggars," but today's young people no longer know what hunger and poverty are. Our per capita daily consumption, calculated in calories, has exceeded many countries, such as Italy, Yugoslavia, West Germany, the United Kingdom, and other countries. This vividly illustrates the improvement of our people's living standards. The proportion of the population covered by social insurance has increased from 31% to 71%. The number of medical and health workers has increased by 40%. Today in Hungary, there are fourteen doctors for every 10,000 residents, while in France there are only ten, and in Denmark and Belgium there are twelve. Today, the actual income of our working people has increased by 56% compared to 1938. Every year, more and more working people are getting modern housing. Our Party and government have formulated a fifteen-year plan for housing construction. During the implementation of this plan, we will build one million new homes, so that we can completely eliminate the legacy left over from the old society in this regard. After the completion of this plan, about 40% of our residents will move into new homes. In addition to the correct policies of our Party and government, which are supported by the broad masses of the people, the rising living standards and political awareness year by year are important sources of the great achievements of our working people.

    In the cultural field, there has also been tremendous development. The fortresses of science—the doors of schools and universities—have been opened to the children of the working people. The number of students at all levels of schools has increased to two or three times the pre-war level. The working people, who were forced into ignorance and oppression in the past, have mastered theaters, cinemas, and concert halls, and they buy and read professional and literary books in unprecedented numbers. Our country guarantees that Hungarian writers and artists who are willing to serve the working people and the cause of socialist construction with their art based on socialist realism can give full play to their wisdom and creative spirit and carry out creative activities under the best conditions. The large number of excellent—many of which are outstanding—literary, musical, and artistic works that have appeared in our country in the past fifteen years fully prove this point. In the Hungarian People's Republic, culture is no longer a privilege, but a treasure of the whole people.

    In evaluating our country's development over the past fifteen years, we can boldly say that our people have proved that they can enjoy freedom and can build a prosperous and happy country on the land of the Danube River. The achievements we have obtained are the result of many factors. The most important of these can be summarized in two points: one is the fraternal unity and mutual assistance of the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union; the other is the correct policy of our Party, which has won the trust and support of our working people. The victory of the Soviet Red Army over the Hitler bandit army has brought significant changes to the lives of our people. Since the beginning of liberation, our people have been able to experience the brotherly help and support of the Soviet Union every day. When people emerged from basements and air-raid shelters just after the war, hungry and ragged, all they saw was ruins and scorched earth. The Soviet Union provided our country with trucks to restore transportation; provided food to relieve hunger; provided medicines to prevent infectious diseases; provided iron ore, coke, cotton, and other raw materials to restore Hungarian industrial production. The three-year plan to restore the national economy also began with a loan from the Soviet Union worth 400 million rubles. This fraternal relationship between us, based on equality and mutual respect for sovereignty, could not exist between large and small countries in any other social system, whether in the past or now. In trade exchanges, more than 82% of the goods exported from the Soviet Union to Hungary are raw materials and semi-finished products, while more than 58% of the goods exported from Hungary to the Soviet Union are machines and precision technology products. We can say that, whether in the past or now, there has never been a capitalist great power that trades with a small country in this way, which is beneficial to the small country: exporting raw materials to the small country, while importing mostly finished products from the small country. Such a relationship cannot be formed between capitalist countries, because the characteristics of these countries are that they exploit not only their own people but also the people of other countries. The fraternal friendship between our people and the Soviet people has a history of decades, and it is a friendship that has been tempered in common struggles. After 1917, tens of thousands of former Hungarian prisoners of war helped the Soviet people defeat the attacks launched by domestic and foreign enemies, while in 1919, former Russian prisoners of war supported the struggle of the Hungarian proletarians. The Soviet army swept the fascist bandit army from our country's territory, gave us assistance in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and the selfless help that the Soviet Union provided us in the area of life, all further strengthened this friendship. Thanks to the support given by the Soviet Union in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots instigated by imperialism, the Hungarian working people repelled the restoration conspiracy of the demons of the old society—landlords and capitalists—and defended the fruits of victory of the past ten years. After the counter-revolutionary incident, the political and economic consolidation of our country was to a large extent due to the political and material support of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. In this way, our people have been able to finally continue to advance unswervingly on the road of socialism. The help given to us in this difficult moment will never be forgotten and will always be appreciated by our people.

    In the relations established between our country and the fraternal countries of the socialist camp, the relationship formed between us and the People's Republic of China is of great significance. The liberation of our two countries has opened up the road for our two peoples to understand and learn from each other. Our fraternal relations are developing and becoming closer year by year. Last year was even more significant. In April and May, the Hungarian Party and government delegation visited China, and during the visit, a friendly cooperation treaty of great significance to us was signed. The visit to China by Dobi István, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, and the Party and government delegation he led, the participation of Comrade Zhu De in the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Hungarian Soviet Republic held in Hungary, and the valuable contribution of the Chinese Communist Party delegation led by Comrade Tan Zhenlin to the 7th Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party were all events of great significance.

    Our people are eagerly looking forward to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's upcoming visit to Hungary and regard it as a sign of the importance that the great Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the government of the People's Republic of China attach to the Hungarian people. The friendship associations of the two countries, which are engaged in activities to deepen the relationship between our two countries, have played a significant role, although they were only established not long ago. We have published many works by Chinese writers and politicians, including the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader loved by the Chinese people. The works about China by Hungarian writers and artists who have visited China are very popular among our people. These works introduce to our people every major event in China's current life: the mass steelmaking movement, the struggle to overcome natural disasters, and the great achievements made in agricultural production due to the establishment and consolidation of the people's communes. These works also introduce to our people the general line of the Chinese Communist Party, and under the brilliant light of the general line, the Chinese people have achieved great achievements that also inspire our people.

    In the ten years since the establishment of economic relations between China and Hungary, the volume of trade between the two countries has increased year by year, and the variety has also been expanding. The products of the Chinese people's productive labor are very popular in our country. Our working people are recognizing more and more Chinese-made machines, and through these, they are experiencing the great development achieved by the People's Republic of China in the past ten years. At the same time, the Hungarian people are happy to see that Hungarian-made machines, precision instruments, and mechanical equipment also play a certain role in China, and that our small country is also helping the Chinese people with their world-historically significant work to the best of its ability. The relationship between us has been strengthened and grown stronger in the common work of building a socialist society and a communist society, and in the struggle against US imperialism. Our people, Party, and government, together with the Chinese working people, the glorious Chinese Communist Party, and the government of the People's Republic of China, firmly and unanimously believe that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China, and that when and by what means to achieve its liberation is entirely China's internal affair. All that the US imperialists can do is to stop their aggression against the Taiwan region of China as soon as possible and abandon the sinister conspiracy to create "two Chinas." We must remind the aggressive forces that the objective laws of social development are playing out ruthlessly, and everyone knows that the reactionary system that the aggressive forces are defending and trying their best to support will sooner or later be thrown into the garbage heap of history. Billions of US dollars cannot stop the power and victory of the East Wind. Sooner or later they will have to face the reality of life.

    Our people recall with eternal gratitude the spiritual, political, and material support that the Chinese people gave us in the process of opposing and suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots instigated by imperialism and in our recovery process. We can confidently say that all the conspiracies of US imperialism against the Chinese and Hungarian people in the United Nations and in other international organizations or in any aspect of life are bound to fail. Because justice is on our side.

    The achievements we have made prove that the help and support provided by the socialist fraternal countries and the world's progressive forces to Hungary have not been in vain, and their trust has been given to people who are worthy of receiving such trust. Our people will always be supporters and protectors of the principles of proletarian internationalism. The ideology of proletarian internationalism is deeply rooted in the hearts of our people, so our people regard the Soviet Union's seven-year plan, the achievements of the Soviet people in science and technology, the great leap forward achieved by the Chinese people through hard work, and all the achievements of the fraternal countries as their own. Our people are proud of these achievements and draw strength from these achievements to better complete the tasks they should complete.

    Another fundamental factor in our achievements is the trust of our working people in the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, which stands on the firm basis of Marxism-Leninism and strives to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism with all its strength, in its Central Committee, and in the deeply popular policies of the worker-peasant revolutionary government. At the 7th Congress of our Party, Comrade Kádár János revealed the secret of our achievements: "Today, from the leaders of the grassroots organizations to the Central Committee in the Party, it is controlled by a communist collective that defends the Party's Marxist-Leninist line and is closely united in the struggle to suppress the counter-revolution." Everyone with a clear head is well aware that without trust, we would not have been able to achieve the achievements introduced above, it would have been impossible to quickly achieve social consolidation after repelling the attack of the counter-revolution, and it would have been impossible to complete the main indicators of this three-year plan in two years.

    When we recall our country's development over the past fifteen years, we also bravely face the mistakes we have made and the difficulties that have arisen. Our Party and government have drawn the lessons they should have learned from these things, and have begun to correct these mistakes long before the criminal attack of the counter-revolution organized and supported by imperialism. Although these mistakes have brought many difficulties, they cannot negate the fact that our country's development over the past fifteen years and the general line of the Party and government are correct.

    Dear comrades, friends!

    Our Party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, held a significant 7th National Congress a few months ago. This Congress openly and frankly discussed the past and put forward inspiring goals for future struggles. Our basic task, as stipulated by the Party Congress, is to complete the foundation of a socialist society in the next few years and to accelerate the building of socialism. The Party Congress approved the main indicators required for the second five-year plan, which will begin in January 1961. By 1965, our country's industrial production will increase by 65%-70% compared to 1958, and agricultural production will increase by 30%-32% compared to the average annual output during the period of 1954-1958. We are mainly preparing to achieve increased production by increasing labor productivity by 37%-40%. During the second five-year plan, we want to increase national income by 50%, increase average real income per person by 26%-29%, and increase the consumption fund by 45%.

    The goals put forward by the Party Congress have been unanimously approved and warmly welcomed by our people. We know that some difficulties will arise in the future, but these difficulties are fundamentally different from those encountered by the Hungarian people before liberation or those encountered by the workers who are now groaning under the shackles of capitalism. Our difficulties are difficulties in development, and their root cause is that the needs of the people who have been liberated under the socialist system naturally come before the development of production. Isn't there a fundamental difference between our difficulties (such as the production of some durable consumer goods still not being able to meet the needs, no matter how much it increases) and the difficulties encountered by the working people in capitalist countries? Although the stock of products in capitalist countries is constantly increasing, the working people are struggling to obtain the minimum living needs due to unemployment and lack of livelihood. We believe that our achievements will increase year by year, because we protect the two treasures that guarantee our achievements as we protect our eyeballs: the fraternal unity and cooperation of the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the trust and support of our working people.

    The tasks before us are huge. In order to complete this task, we need peace. Peace is the top priority in Hungary's foreign policy. Our people know very well that only if we further strengthen our relations with the socialist fraternal countries, only if we do our best to make the principle of peaceful coexistence a universally observed criterion in international relations, only if we carry out a resolute struggle against the imperialists who attempt to launch a war, and only if we support with all our strength the people of all countries who are fighting for freedom and independence against imperialist oppression and exploitation, can we guarantee the peaceful environment needed for construction. Proceeding from this policy, our people and government welcome with sincere enthusiasm the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, the Soviet Union's great seven-year plan for building communism, the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic government's initiatives for solving the German and West Berlin problems, and all proposals aimed at serving peace and social progress, regardless of when, where, or by whom they are proposed. Therefore, we support the increasingly frequent personal contacts between the heads of great powers and look forward with hope to the summit meeting to be held in May.

    We must also point out that our people are watching with unease some of the conspiracy activities of the United States and other war blocs to maintain the Cold War and undermine the summit meeting. We are particularly vigilant about the activities of West German revanchists and fascists who dare to crawl out of their nests. Fifteen years is not a long time, and no one will forget the disasters and destruction that German militarism and fascism brought to our people in the two world wars.

    The love for a free and happy life and for the socialist system that guarantees this life has redoubled the firm position of the Hungarian people to do everything possible to prevent the recurrence of this bloody historical event. We agree with the fraternal countries united in the Warsaw Treaty defensive organization that, as stipulated in the recent Moscow Warsaw Treaty Member States Declaration, according to the degree of today's military technological development, neither the German question nor other disputed questions can be solved by violent means. The only practical way to resolve disputes is to establish national relations on the basis of peaceful coexistence. Any country, regardless of its social system, should be prepared to engage in peaceful competition, because this will only be beneficial to them.

    Our foreign policy proceeds from these principles and strives to establish cooperative relations with any country that is willing to engage in good cooperation with us on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and non-aggression. We are a member of the socialist family and carry out a peaceful policy together with the countries of the socialist camp. This fact has enhanced our country's prestige and made our international relations increasingly broader, despite how the US imperialists undermine them. Today, our country has established diplomatic relations with forty-seven countries. And the representatives of the Hungarian people loudly represent the voice of peace of our people in two hundred and fifty international organizations.

    We have achieved great achievements since 1945. We should express our gratitude to the Soviet Union and the socialist fraternal countries for these achievements. We are proud that for the first time in her history our country is not isolated, but is a member of a great fraternal group - an invincible socialist camp. On this day, our people look up with gratitude and trust to our consolidated, united Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and its Central Committee, which are constantly leading our people from victory to victory.

    On this day, our people first pay tribute and love to those who brought us freedom and independence and spared their precious lives for the liberation of our people. We sincerely say, thank you to the Soviet people, eternal glory to the Soviet soldiers.

    Long live the Hungarian People's Republic, which is fighting for the cause of peace and building socialism for fifteen years, our united and consolidated Marxist-Leninist party - the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party! Long live the Hungarian working people!

    Long live the deepening friendship and fraternal cooperation between the people of China and Hungary!

    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and the Hungarian people, and the consolidated alliance of the fraternal people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    Long live world peace!

    匈牙利在社会主义建设大道上前进
    匈牙利驻华大使馆临时代办西格蒂在首都庆祝匈牙利人民解放十五周年大会上的讲话亲爱的陈毅副总理同志，亲爱的同志们，亲爱的朋友们：
    请允许我向组织这个匈牙利解放十五周年庆祝大会的各个团体表示衷心的谢意，并热烈地向出席这个大会的中华人民共和国的美丽首都——北京人民的代表们表示敬意。
    十五年前，1945年4月4日，匈牙利劳动人民从德国法西斯匪徒及其匈牙利的走狗的枷锁下解放出来，并且由于光荣的苏联红军具有世界历史意义的胜利，走上了独立、自主和自由的生活道路。
    匈牙利劳动人民的历史，是匈牙利劳动人民反对统治阶级的残酷剥削、反对他们为了维持这种剥削而出卖民族利益和反对外国压迫者的斗争史。1514年由多热·久尔吉领导的农民起义，为反对土耳其的压迫和为期四百年的奥地利的占领而进行的斗争，1848年与争取民族独立的斗争同时进行的资产阶级民主革命，以及1919年的无产阶级革命，都不仅对匈牙利民族有意义，而且是具有国际意义的事件，也鼓舞了其他被压迫的民族。
    我国劳动人民千年来的斗争，于1945年4月4日，在苏联红军的帮助下，最后胜利了。英雄的苏联军队具有历史意义的军事行动，不仅粉碎了法西斯主义，而且实现了匈牙利劳动人民世世代代梦寐以求的理想，并在我国人民心目中留下对苏联各族人民的不可磨灭的印象和深厚的感激之情。
    1945年，我国劳动人民在极其艰难的情况下掌握了自己的命运。解放时，作为半封建半资本主义遗产的我国工农业极为落后。解放前，在我们这个资源极为丰富、自然条件良好的国家里，许多人都找不到工作，生活没有着落。失业者的人数经常在三十—八十万人之间，同时年年都有几万人流亡国外，漂泊在世界各个角落。大封建主所有制，沉重地压在国家头上。全国耕地总面积的30％集中在只占农村有地人口的0.1％的大地主手里。同时，占农村有地人口的64％的人们，其土地只占全国耕地总面积的9.5％。其中大多数人不能靠土地维持生活，只得像数十万没有土地的人们一样，出卖自己的劳动力以便糊口。劳动人民丝毫无权参与国家管理。文化教育，劳动人民更不能问津。代表穷人的伟大诗人尤若夫·阿蒂拉曾经在“我的祖国”这首诗中这样来描写解放前工人、农民们的无限穷困的生活：
    成千的不同的国民病、
    婴儿的死亡的频繁、
    一子制度和贫困的罪恶、
    流落成孤儿、未老先衰、
    精神病、自杀、莫名其妙地
    期待着奇迹的精神慵懒，
    这一切都只为叫人清醒：
    应该从这里解放出来！
    应该在劳动人民
    了解真相的聪明的会议上
    讨论我们的千百个问题。
    诗人的愿望已经实现了。解放给我国人民的社会、经济、文化以及生活的一切领域带来了根本的变化。全国进步力量在匈牙利共产党的领导下，经过几年坚决的政治斗争粉碎了资产阶级的后备阵地。1948年匈牙利劳动者的两个政党的合并，建立了匈牙利人民的大团结。1949年颁布的匈牙利人民的第一个成文的宪法——匈牙利人民共和国的宪法，正确地断言：“匈牙利人民共和国是匈牙利工人和劳动农民的国家。”
    劳动人民的子弟把国民议会掌握在自己手中，并通过它和以后成立的各级地方议会的十万六千名代表，直接参与立法和执行法律的工作。这样，在匈牙利那个不问劳动人民的意见、违反劳动人民的意志而立法执法的时代，就一去不复返了。
    解放时，国家的经济生活处于被破坏的状态中。过去统治阶级的罪恶的反苏战争，带来的是价值为五年国民收入的损失，换言之，我国劳动人民五年劳动的果实被毁掉了。我国九百万人口中约有九十万人死亡、残废或丧失全部劳动力。我国的牲畜损失了65％。工业设备的一大部分被盗运到西方或被毁掉。仅在布达佩斯一市，有十万套住宅被毁。全国各地，连最小的桥梁也被炸断，铁路被破坏。
    在地下活动中遭受严重损失的、但在艰巨斗争中壮大起来的、与群众打成一片的匈牙利共产党，在这样的情况下提出了恢复工作的号召，并宣布，用辛勤的劳动可以把我国建设成一个富裕的幸福的国家。党的诺言成为现实了。我国重生了，她既独立，又自由，她的经济比过去任何时候更加发达。我国现在工业生产接近1938年的四倍。我们在经济政策中彻底地消除了教条主义和修正主义的观点后，工业发展速度在最近两、三年内特别加快了。在这几年中，我国工业生产每年增长13％—14％。在荒凉的草原上诞生了新的城市，像具有三万四千人口的斯大林城，有二万一千人口的柯姆洛城，以及科金兹巴尔兹加市等等。在对原有的工业部门进行现代化的同时，还建立了许多新的工业部门。其产品在全世界为我国劳动人民取得了威信。
    1945年进行的土地改革振奋了农民，他们积极地参加建设。我国农业生产在1958年比1934—1938年的平均年产量增加了15％，但同时也可以看出，农业的生产发展落在工业发展的后面。当全民所有制的工业生产不受任何阻挠地向前发展时，而农业却陷于小块土地经营、农具落后和土地私有制的束缚中。工业的发展，文化生活的普及，农村的电气化，现代化的农业机械的应用，以及收音机和最近电视机在农村中的出现，都对我国劳动农民有很大影响。苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家农民的榜样，以及早期成立的农业合作社和国营农场的成绩，向我国农民证明了以现代化技术为基础的集体生产的优越性。由于我国农民认识到这一切，特别是他们对党和政府政策的信任，掀起了我们1959年以来能亲眼看到的合作化运动如此迅速的高涨。只有那些不了解或不肯了解匈牙利农民生活和思想上发生的巨大变化的那些人，才会对大批农民群众参加合作社感到惊异。今天我们已经可以高兴地宣布，我国耕地总面积的71.3％以上已是社会主义类型的农业企业。在我们农业生产合作社里已有九十万农民，匈牙利农村大部分已变成社会主义农村。新成立的农业社迅速地巩固起来。去年我国农业社取得了良好的成绩。1959年我国农业生产比前一年增长了7％。这些良好的成绩不仅说明新入社农民的出色劳动，同时也说明各兄弟国家、首先是苏联以农业机械给予我们的援助。1960年这一年在我们国家的生活中是具有重大意义的一年。这不仅因为在这一年中我们将为第二个五年计划建立更高的出发点，而且农业社会主义的改造大部分正要在新的五年计划开始前完成。我们可以有把握地宣布，社会主义制度在我国的一切领域内最后胜利了。我们不是用一条腿，而是用社会主义工业和社会主义农业这两条腿在建设社会主义的大道上前进着。
    过去的十五年，为我国劳动人民的生活带来了极为深刻的变化。今天我国青年已经不知道什么是雇农和贩卖人口，也不知道领到大学毕业文凭而无业可就以及黑名单等等类似的事情。过去外国把霍尔蒂匈牙利叫做“三百万乞丐的国家”，今天的青年人已经不知道什么叫饥饿和贫困了。我们每人每日的消费，用卡罗里计算，已经超过了许多国家，如意大利、南斯拉夫、西德、英国等国家。这一点生动地说明了我国人民生活水平的提高。享有社会保险者，在全国人口中所占的比重从31％增加到71％。医药卫生工作者的人数增加了40％。今天在匈牙利，每一万个居民中有十四个医生，而在法国只有十个，在丹麦、比利时有十二个。今天我国劳动人民的实际收入与1938年相比，增加了56％。每年都有越来越多的劳动人民得到现代化的住宅。我们的党和政府制定了住宅建设的十五年规划。在执行这个计划的期间，我们将兴建一百万套新住宅，这样我们可以彻底消除从旧社会遗留下来的这方面的遗产。完成这个计划之后，我国居民约40％将搬到新住宅。除了我们党和政府正确的、受广大人民群众拥护的政策以外，一年比一年提高的生活水平和政治觉悟是我国劳动人民取得伟大成就的重要源泉。
    在文化领域内，也有巨大的发展。科学的堡垒——学校和大学的大门为劳动人民的子弟开放。各级学校的学生人数增加到战前水平的两、三倍。过去被迫处于愚昧和压迫中的劳动人民，掌握了剧场、电影院和音乐厅，他们空前未有地大量购买并阅读专业和文学书籍。我们国家保证那些根据社会主义现实主义思想、愿意用自己的艺术为劳动人民为社会主义建设事业服务的匈牙利作家和艺术家，在最良好的条件下充分发挥其智慧和创造精神，进行创作活动。我国十五年来，出现了大量的优秀的——其中许多是杰出的文学、音乐和造型艺术作品，可充分证明这一点。在匈牙利人民共和国，文化已经不再是一种特权，而成为全民的宝藏了。
    在评价我国十五年的发展时，我们可以大胆地说，我国人民证明了他们能够享受自由并能在多瑙河畔的国土上建立一个繁荣、幸福的国家。我们所获得的成就是许多因素的共同结果。其中最重要的可以用两点归纳起来：一个是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国兄弟般的团结和互相帮助；另一个是我们党的正确政策，博得了我国劳动人民的信任和支持。苏联红军对希特勒匪军的胜利，在我国人民的生活中带来了具有重大意义的变化。我国人民自从解放开始，日日都能体会到苏联兄弟般的帮助和支持。当人们在战争刚刚结束，腹中无食，衣衫褴褛，蹒跚走出地下室和防空洞时，他们举目所瞩，尽是一片废墟焦土。苏联向我国提供了载重汽车，以便恢复交通；提供了食品，解除饥饿；提供了药品，预防传染病；提供了铁矿石、焦炭、棉花以及其他原材料，以便恢复匈牙利工业生产。为恢复国家经济的三年计划也是靠苏联的价值四亿卢布的贷款而开始的。我们之间的这种基于平等和互相尊重主权的兄弟关系，无论过去或现在，在任何另一种社会制度的大国与小国之间都是不能有的。在贸易来往中，苏联向匈牙利输出的商品有82％以上是原材料和半成品，同时匈牙利向苏联输出的商品有58％以上是机器和精密技术产品。我们可以说，无论过去或现在，世界上从来没有过一个资本主义大国这样的和小国进行有利于小国的贸易：将原材料输出给小国，而从小国输入的大多是成品。在资本主义各国之间不可能形成这样的关系，因为这些国家的特点是除了剥削本国人民之外还剥削他国人民。我国人民和苏联人民之间兄弟般的友谊具有数十年的历史，并且这是一种在共同斗争中受到锻炼的友谊。1917年后，数万个前匈牙利战俘帮助苏联人民击溃了国内外敌人所发动的进攻，同时在1919年，前俄罗斯战俘支援了匈牙利无产者的斗争，苏军从我国国土上扫除了法西斯匪军，在镇压反革命叛乱方面给了我们援助，苏联在生活领域方面提供给我们的无私的帮助，都进一步地加强了这种友谊。由于苏联在镇压帝国主义策动的反革命暴乱时给予我们的支援，匈牙利劳动人民击退了旧社会的魔鬼——地主、资本家的复辟阴谋，捍卫了十年来的胜利果实。反革命事件后，我国政治、经济上的巩固，在很大程度上是由于苏联和其他兄弟国家的政治和物质上的支援。这样，我国人民有可能终于毫不动摇地在社会主义大道上继续前进。在这困难的时刻所给予我们的帮助，是我国人民永远忘不了，永远感激的。
    在我国与社会主义阵营各兄弟国家所建立的关系中，我们与中华人民共和国所形成的关系，具有重大的意义。我们两国的解放为我们两国人民开辟了相互了解、相互学习的道路。我们兄弟般的关系一年比一年发展和更加密切。去年更有特别重大的意义。4、5月间匈牙利党政代表团在中国进行了访问，并在访问期间签订了对我们来说非常珍贵、有着非常重大意义的友好合作条约。匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比·伊斯特万以及他所率领的党政代表团在中国进行了访问，朱德同志参加了在匈牙利举行的匈牙利苏维埃共和国四十周年的纪念活动，以及谭震林同志所率领的中国共产党代表团对匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会的宝贵贡献，都是具有重大意义的事件。
    我国人民热情地期待着刘少奇同志即将到匈牙利所进行的访问，并认为这是伟大的中国人民、中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府重视匈牙利人民的标志。为加深我们两国之间的关系而进行活动的两国友好协会，虽然只是不久以前才成立，但发挥了显著的作用。我们出版了许多中国作家和政治家的著作，其中有中国人民爱戴的领袖毛泽东同志的作品。曾在中国访问过的匈牙利作家和艺术家的有关中国的作品，很受我国人民的欢迎。这些作品向我国人民介绍了中国今日生活的每一个重大事件：全民炼钢运动，为克服自然灾害而进行的斗争，由于人民公社的成立和巩固在农业生产上所取得的伟大成就。这些作品还向我国人民介绍了中国共产党的总路线，在总路线的光辉照耀下，中国人民获得了使我国人民也为之振奋的伟大成就。
    中匈两国建立经济关系十年以来，两国之间的贸易额一年比一年增加，而且在品种方面也日益扩大。中国人民生产劳动的产品在我国备受欢迎，我国劳动人民认识越来越多的中国制造的机器，并且通过这些体会到中华人民共和国成立十年来所获得的巨大发展。匈牙利人民同时高兴地看到，匈牙利制造的机器、精密仪器和机械设备在中国也发挥了一定的作用，看到我们小的国家根据自己的能力对中国人民具有世界历史意义的工作也有帮助。我们之间的关系，在为建成社会主义社会、共产主义社会而进行的共同工作中，并在反对美帝国主义的斗争中加强和壮大了。我们的人民、党和政府与中国劳动人民、光荣的中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府一起，坚决一致地认为台湾是中华人民共和国的不可分割的一部分，而在何时、用何种方法来实现它的解放完全是中国人民的内政。美帝国主义者所能作的事情只是尽早停止他对中国台湾地区的侵略，放弃制造“两个中国”的罪恶阴谋。我们必须提醒侵略势力注意，社会发展的客观规律无情地发挥着作用，每个人都很清楚，侵略势力所维护的和千方百计支持的反动制度迟早会被抛到历史的垃圾堆上。亿万美金阻挡不了东风的力量和胜利。他们或早或晚一定要面对着生活的现实。
    我国人民怀着永不消失的感激心情，回想在反对和镇压帝国主义所策动的反革命暴乱过程中以及我国进行恢复过程中，中国人民所给予我们在精神、政治和物质方面的支援。我们可以有把握地说，美帝国主义在联合国和在其它的国际组织里或在生活的任何方面反对中国和匈牙利人民的一切阴谋一定要遭到失败。因为正义是在我们这方面。
    我们所取得的成就证明，社会主义兄弟国家和世界进步势力给匈牙利提供的帮助和支援并非是徒劳无益的，他们的信任是给予了无愧于得到这种信任的人。我国人民永远是无产阶级国际主义原则的拥护者和保护者。无产阶级国际主义思想深入我国人民心中，因此我国人民把苏联的七年计划，苏联人民在科学技术上的成就，中国人民辛勤劳动所取得的大跃进，各兄弟国家的一切成就，都看成是自己的。我国人民为这些成就感到骄傲，并从这些成就中取得力量来更好地完成他们所应完成的任务。
    我们取得成就的另外一个基本因素，是我国劳动人民对站在马克思列宁主义稳固基础上、尽一切力量为捍卫马克思列宁主义纯洁而斗争的匈牙利社会主义工人党，对它的中央委员会，对工农革命政府的深入人心的政策的信任。在我们党的第七次代表大会上，卡达尔·亚诺什同志揭示了我们成就的秘诀：“今天在党内从基层组织的领导到中央委员会是由保卫党的马克思列宁主义路线、在镇压反革命的斗争中紧密团结起来的共产主义集体所掌握的”。每一个头脑清醒的人都十分清楚，如果没有信任，那我们就不可能达到以上所介绍的成就，不可能在打退了反革命的进攻之后，迅速地实现社会巩固，也不可能在两年内完成这次三年计划的主要指标。
    当我们回忆我国十五年来的发展的时候，我们还勇敢地面对着我们所犯过的错误和出现的困难。我们的党和政府从这些东西中吸取了应有的教训，并远在帝国主义所组织和支持的反革命罪恶进攻之前就已经开始纠正这些错误。这些错误虽然带来了许多困难，但却不能抹煞这样一个事实，即我国十五年来的发展以及党和政府的总路线是正确的。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    我们的党，匈牙利社会主义工人党几个月前举行了意义重大的第七次全国代表大会。这次代表大会公开而坦率地讨论了过去，并且提出了鼓舞人心的对于未来的奋斗的目标。我们的基本任务，正如党代表大会所规定的那样，在今后几年中要完成社会主义社会的奠基工作，并要加速社会主义的建成。党代表大会通过了将在1961年1月开始的第二个五年计划所需要的主要指标。到1965年，我国工业生产与1958年相比将增长65％—70％，农业生产与1954—1958年期间的平均年产量相比，则将增长30％—32％。我们主要是准备通过提高劳动生产率37％—40％来实现增产的。在第二个五年计划期间我们要使国民收入增加50％，每人的平均实际收入提高26％—29％，消费基金提高45％。
    党代表大会所提出的奋斗目标受到我国人民一致的赞同和热烈欢迎。我们知道，今后也会出现一些困难，但这些困难与匈牙利人民在解放前所遇到的或现在呻吟于资本主义枷锁下的劳动者所遇到的那些困难，有本质上的区别。我们的困难是发展中的困难，其根源是在社会主义制度下被解放了的人们的需要自然而然地走在生产发展的前面。难道我们的困难（如一些耐用消费品的生产不管如何的增长，仍不能满足需要）同资本主义国家内劳动人民所遭遇到的困难没有本质上的区别吗？虽然在资本主义国家库存的产品不断增多，但是劳动人民由于失业，生活无所着落，只得为获得最低限度的生活需要而挣扎。我们相信，我们的成绩一年比一年增加，因为我们如保护自己的眼珠一样，保护着保证我们取得成绩的两个宝物：以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国兄弟般的团结与合作和我国劳动人民的信任和支持。
    摆在我们面前的任务是巨大的。为了完成这个任务我们需要和平。匈牙利对外政策中占首要地位的是和平。我国人民知道得很清楚，只有我们进一步加强与社会主义兄弟国家的关系，只有全力采取为使和平共处的原则成为国际关系中的普遍遵守的准则，只有我们反对企图发动战争的帝国主义者而进行坚决的斗争，只有我们用一切力量支持反对帝国主义压迫和剥削、为争取自由和独立而进行斗争的各国人民，我们才能保证建设工作所需要的和平环境。从这种政策出发，我国人民和政府以由衷的热情欢迎苏联政府关于全面彻底裁军的建议，苏联建设共产主义的伟大的七年计划，苏联和德意志民主共和国政府关于为解决德国和西柏林问题的一切倡议，以及所有旨在为和平和社会进步而服务的建议，不管它是何时、何处、何人提出的。因此我们支持大国首脑越来越频繁的个人接触，并怀着希望，期待着即将在5月召开的最高级首脑会议。
    我们还必须指出，我国人民不安地注视着某些美国和其他战争集团企图维持冷战和破坏最高级会议的阴谋活动。我们特别警惕地注意着西德复仇主义者和敢于从巢窝中爬出的法西斯分子的活动。十五年并不是一个长的时间，谁也不会忘记德国军国主义和法西斯主义在两次世界大战中给我国人民带来的灾难和破坏。
    对自由幸福生活和对保证这个生活的社会主义制度的热爱，加倍地加强了匈牙利人民的坚定立场，要尽一切力量阻止这个血腥的历史事件的重演。我们与团结在华沙条约防御性组织里的各兄弟国家一致认为，正如最近莫斯科华沙条约缔约国宣言中规定的那样，根据今日军事技术发展的程度，不论德国问题还是其它有争执的问题，都不能用暴力手段来解决，解决争执的唯一切实可行的方法是把国家的关系建立在和平共处的基础上。任何一个国家不管其社会制度如何，都应该准备好进行和平竞赛，因为这对他们只会是有利的。
    我们的对外政策从这些原则出发，力图与任何一个愿意在平等互利互不侵犯原则的基础上和我们进行良好合作的国家建立合作关系。我们是社会主义大家庭的一个成员，与社会主义阵营各国一起执行和平政策，这个事实提高了我们国家的威望，并使我们的国际关系越来越扩大，尽管美国帝国主义如何破坏。今天我国已与四十七个国家建立了外交关系。而匈牙利人民的代表在二百五十个国际组织中响亮地代表我国人民和平之声。
    我们从1945年来获得了伟大的成就，为了这些成就我们应当向苏联和各社会主义兄弟国家表示感谢。我们为我们祖国在她的历史上第一次不是孤立的，而是一个伟大的兄弟般的团体——不可战胜的社会主义阵营中的一员感到骄傲。这一天，我国人民怀着感激和信任仰望着我们巩固的、团结一致的不断领导我国人民从胜利走向胜利的匈牙利社会主义工人党及其中央委员会。
    这一天，我国人民首先向给我们带来自由独立并为我国人民解放不惜自己宝贵生命的人，致以敬意和爱戴。我们衷心地说，感谢苏联人民，永不磨灭的光荣归于苏联战士。
    为和平事业而斗争的、建设社会主义十五年的匈牙利人民共和国，我们团结一致的、巩固的马克思列宁主义政党——匈牙利社会主义工人党万岁！匈牙利劳动人民万岁！
    匈中两国人民不断加深的友谊和兄弟合作万岁！
    苏联各族人民和匈牙利人民的牢不可破的友谊、以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各兄弟人民巩固的联盟万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
