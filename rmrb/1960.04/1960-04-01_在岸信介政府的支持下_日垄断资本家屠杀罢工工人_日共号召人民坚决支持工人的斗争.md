A compilation of reports from our newspaper. Tokyo dispatch: Japanese coal mining monopoly enterprise Mitsui Mining Co. used violence on the 28th to sabotage the workers' strike, injuring 140 miners, more than 20 of whom were seriously injured. This major violent incident was caused by the company authorities instigating thugs from the company union and right-wing groups to attack the picket line of striking workers at the Miike Coal Mine. The Kishi Nobusuke government's "Maritime Safety Agency" dispatched ships to help the company transport the thugs of the company union to land near the mine.

On the 29th, 200 thugs from the company side attacked the residential area of the Miike Coal Mine workers, stabbing miner Kiyoshi Kubo to death and injuring more than a dozen workers.

The Miike Coal Mine workers have been waging an unyielding struggle against layoffs and have been on an indefinite strike since January 25. The company recently organized a company union and used various means to split and suppress the Miike Coal Mine Union.

The crime of Mitsui Coal Mine monopoly capital colluding with the Kishi Nobusuke government to use violence to suppress the Miike Coal Mine workers' strike and kill workers has aroused great anger and protest from the Japanese working class and the people of the whole country.

Today, 3.5 million workers of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held workplace rallies across the country to protest the killing of Miike Coal Mine worker Kiyoshi Kubo. At the same time, state-owned railway workers have stopped transporting coal for Mitsui Mining Co.

1,500 workers in Tokyo today once again demonstrated in front of Mitsui Mining Co. to protest the crime of massacring Miike Coal Mine workers. At this time, employees of Mitsui Mining Co., who were locked inside the company gate, waved red flags from the building windows, expressing their support for the demonstration.

Representatives of the Japan Socialist Party and the Communist Party exposed the conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke government, coal mine capitalists, police, and thugs colluding to suppress the Miike Coal Mine workers' strike at a mass rally held before the demonstration.

Hideo Yamahana, Director of the Organization Bureau of the Socialist Party, reported the results of an on-site investigation into the murder of Miike Coal Mine worker Kiyoshi Kubo. He revealed that the capitalists had been preparing to launch an armed attack on the workers even before this massacre occurred.

The Japanese Communist Party published an appeal in the "Akahata" on the 31st, calling on the Japanese working class and the people of the whole country to immediately take resolute action to deal with the coal industry monopoly capitalists' atrocities of massacring Miike Coal Mine workers.

The appeal condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for condoning the thugs' barbaric act of massacring workers, and solemnly pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government was attempting to use this major murder incident to achieve its political conspiracy of suppressing the people. The appeal also strongly condemned the ruling Liberal Democratic Party for instigating Mitsui Coal Industry capitalists to commit crimes.

The appeal called on the people of the whole country to resolutely support the striking Miike Coal Mine workers, launch protests against the Kishi Nobusuke government, Mitsui monopoly capitalists, and the police, and called on workers around the world to protest against the brutal acts of Japanese monopoly capitalists in massacring workers.

    在岸信介政府的支持下
    日垄断资本家屠杀罢工工人
    日共号召人民坚决支持工人的斗争
    本报综合报道　东京消息：日本煤矿垄断企业三井矿山公司28日使用暴力破坏工人罢工，打伤一百四十名矿工，其中有二十多人伤势严重。这一重大凶伤事件是公司当局唆使御用工会和右翼团体的暴徒进攻三池煤矿罢工工人的纠察线造成的。御用工会的打手是由岸信介政府“海上保安厅”派舰艇帮助公司运往矿山附近登陆的。
    29日，公司方面的二百名打手又袭击了三池煤矿工人的住宅区，用匕首刺杀了矿工久保清打伤了十多名工人。
    三池煤矿工人为了反对解雇一直进行着不屈的斗争，并且从1月25日起举行无限期罢工。公司方面最近组织了一个御用工会，用各种手段分裂和镇压三池煤矿工会。
    三井煤矿垄断资本勾结岸信介政府使用暴力镇压三池煤矿工人罢工和杀害工人的罪行，激起了日本工人阶级和全国人民的极大愤怒与抗议。
    日本工会总评议会的三百五十万工人今天在全国各地举行工作场所大会，抗议杀害三池煤矿工人久保清。与此同时，国营铁道工人已经停止给三井矿山公司运煤。
    东京的一千五百名工人今天再次到三井矿山公司前面举行示威，抗议屠杀三池煤矿工人的罪行。这时，被关在公司大门内的三井矿山公司的职工从楼窗口挥舞着红旗，表示声援示威。
    日本社会党和共产党代表在示威前举行的群众大会上揭露了岸信介政府、煤矿资本家、警察和暴徒勾结在一起来镇压三池煤矿工人罢工的阴谋。
    社会党组织局长山花秀雄报告了对屠杀三池煤矿工人久保清事件进行现场调查的结果。他揭露说，资方在这次屠杀事件发生以前，一直准备向工人发动武装攻击。
    日本共产党31日在“赤旗报”上发表呼吁书，号召日本工人阶级和全国人民立刻采取坚决的行动，对付煤业垄断资本家屠杀三池煤矿工人的暴行。
    呼吁书指责岸信介政府纵容打手屠杀工人的野蛮行为，并且严正指出岸信介政府企图利用这个重大凶杀事件来达到它镇压人民的政治阴谋。呼吁书还强烈谴责执政的自由民主党唆使三井煤业资本家行凶的卑鄙行为。
    呼吁书号召全国人民坚决支持正在罢工的三池煤矿工人，对岸信介政府、三井垄断资本家和警察展开抗议行动，并且呼吁全世界工人对日本垄断资本家屠杀工人的残暴行为提出抗议。
