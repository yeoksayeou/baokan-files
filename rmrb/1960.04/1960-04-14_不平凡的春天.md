    An Extraordinary Spring
    By our reporter Zhang Xinmin

    In early March, as spring just arrived on the land of the German Democratic Republic, the high tide of the agricultural collectivization movement appeared in the Rostock District on the Baltic Sea coast. In just over a month, thirteen out of the country's fourteen districts had announced complete collectivization. Although more than half of the Republic's capital, Berlin, is currently occupied by Western countries, farmers in the suburbs of the democratic sector also announced their full participation in agricultural production cooperatives in early April. People can foresee that it won't be long before the good news of nationwide collectivization arrives.

    Complete collectivization is a tremendous victory for socialism in the countryside of the German Democratic Republic in the first spring of the 1960s. This victory is not accidental. Comrade Tisch, Chairman of the Rostock District People's Council, the first district to achieve complete collectivization, said to reporters while introducing the situation of complete collectivization in the district's rural areas: Complete collectivization is the result of long-term work. Since the district began setting up agricultural production cooperatives in 1952, it has been working tirelessly. The counter-revolutionary riots of June 17, 1953, did not affect the leadership's determination. Although the cooperatives were only gradually developing, the direction of collectivization never wavered. By the end of last year, the collectivized land in the district had exceeded 60%, making it a district with a relatively high degree of collectivization in the country. The average cash income of each work-day in the district's cooperatives reached 8.76 marks, and the superiority of the cooperatives was increasingly recognized by the farmers. In addition, the international situation is developing in a direction favorable to peace and socialism, the socialist camp is growing stronger, and the German Democratic Republic is becoming more consolidated, all of which help to raise the farmers' awareness. At the same time, with the improvement of residents' living standards, the demand for livestock products has greatly increased, increasing the burden of imports. It is necessary to transform the individual economy into a socialist large-scale production method in order to improve domestic agricultural production and catch up with and surpass West Germany in terms of per capita consumption and labor productivity. This necessity has also strengthened the leadership's determination to promote the accelerated development of the collectivization movement.

    Of course, these necessities and possibilities are not unique to the Rostock District. The entire Republic objectively possesses the same conditions and requirements. After the Seventh Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party in December last year, the Party committees of various districts held meetings to discuss the issue of collectivization. Many districts made it their central task, and all other tasks revolved around it. The central government sent working groups to help the districts carry out their work. In some districts, most of the party and government cadres went to the countryside, and the workers also took action. An army of thousands upon thousands mobilized farmers to promote the collectivization movement deep into the countryside. Cooperative chairmen, party branch secretaries, village cadres, and party activists were the backbone of the movement. They talked to farmers who had not yet joined the cooperatives every day, explaining to them the reasons why they should participate in the cooperatives. Objective needs and possibilities, coupled with arduous subjective work, have made the speed of the collectivization movement exceed people's original expectations. In the German Democratic Republic, a saying has recently become popular: "The apple is ripe." People use this to illustrate that the rapid development of the current collectivization movement is based on mature conditions.

    The victory of rural collectivization was achieved by overcoming the various sabotage activities carried out by the enemies in West Germany and West Berlin. The ruling groups in West Germany and West Berlin are constantly looking for opportunities to oppose the German Democratic Republic. They hate every progressive measure of the German Democratic Republic. Collectivization is naturally no exception. Radios and televisions are very common in the rural areas of the German Democratic Republic. They use radio and television to spread rumors, and the RIAS radio station in the American-occupied sector of West Berlin is particularly active in this incitement. Balloons also floated over the German Democratic Republic to scatter leaflets and cause trouble. Newspapers are filled with rumors every day.

    In response to the incitement and propaganda of the enemies in West Germany and West Berlin, ideological work needs to be strengthened. Comrade Biack, Director of the Propaganda Department of the New Brandenburg District Party Committee, told reporters: In this movement, the district leadership had long anticipated the enemy's sabotage. Therefore, in advance, they clarified the policies to the cadres and the masses in light of the masses' thinking, and constantly studied the development of the masses' thinking and explained it in a timely manner. This prevented the enemy's sabotage from succeeding. We must always take the offensive against the enemy in order to take the initiative. In this movement, we always walked in front, and the enemy was always one step behind.

    In the face of the revolutionary movement in which the masses themselves acted and formed a mighty momentum, all kinds of conspiracies and sabotage activities were smashed and exposed. Some rich peasants who fled to West Berlin several years ago and have been sabotaging the development of agricultural production cooperatives through agents have also been exposed in this movement. Many farmers who are living a prosperous life today, recalling that they were landless agricultural workers or immigrants fifteen years ago, have expressed their determination not to let the Junkers return.

    In this high tide of the collectivization movement, a considerable proportion of those who joined the cooperatives were wealthy farmers known as "well-to-do households." Mobilizing these people to join the cooperatives is indeed not a simple matter. Over the past few years, relying on their strong manpower, horses, and cattle, they have touted individual management as the best way of agricultural production. Before complete collectivization, some of them even formed alliances, betting and vowing never to join the cooperatives. But, before long, they all changed their positions and became members of the cooperatives. What force prompted them to join the cooperatives? The enemy spread rumors that they were "driven in." Comrade Tisch, Chairman of the Rostock District People's Council, said well: "We don't have such a great power to 'drive' tens of thousands of farmers into cooperatives in such a short period of time!" The Maurenz family in Lakou Township, Glim County, is a good illustration. Maurenz and his wife cultivated fifteen hectares of land, raised seven large dairy cows, and had many fat pigs. Their cash income last year was more than 18,000 marks. Although life was prosperous, Mrs. Maurenz had to work fifteen or sixteen hours a day. Not long ago, after she visited an advanced cooperative, her horizons suddenly broadened. The cooperative had a large workforce and many machines, and after work, there was also cultural life. The members sometimes gathered to talk, and the children were also taken care of by the kindergarten. Mrs. Maurenz saw the prospect of collectivization and no longer wanted to spend her life in the cowshed and pigsty. In this high tide of the collectivization movement, she became an activist, joined the cooperative with her husband, and was elected as a member of the cooperative affairs committee. In Bart Port Township, Libnitz-Teien County, on the Baltic Sea coast, we met a farmer named Fick. Fick and his wife also had fifteen hectares of land, raised five dairy cows and twenty pigs, and had a motorcycle. Their income last year was more than 20,000 marks. When the township set up a cooperative in 1952, he observed and calculated from the sidelines. Last year, according to him, he thought about it for a whole year. If he joined the cooperative, he would be reluctant to give up his livestock and land; if he didn't join, other families in the village had joined one after another, and it would be difficult for him to manage alone. The couple didn't know how many family meetings they held, but in the end, their son helped them make the decision. Little Fick worked in a state-owned farm and was determined not to inherit his father's land. As a result, Mr. Fick thought to himself, what was the point of keeping the property? Both of them were already fifty years old. How many more years could they work in the fields? It was better to join the cooperative.

    For several months, debates have been unfolding everywhere in the Republic's countryside. Cooperative members used various facts to illustrate the superiority of the cooperatives and the state's need to develop agricultural production, while individual management could no longer meet this need. Joining the cooperative has become a real trend.

    Who "drove" about 200,000 farmers into the cooperatives in a few months? It is clear that these farmers themselves saw the prospects, recognized the general trend, and chose the path they should take.

    The rural areas that have just been completely collectivized have already shown a new atmosphere. Most areas completed spring sowing earlier than last year under drier weather conditions. Several districts that have recently been completely collectivized are carrying out spring sowing while carrying out collectivization. Many newly established Type I cooperatives (primary cooperatives, livestock not included) are planning to build large cattle sheds and pigsties, preparing to upgrade to Type III cooperatives (advanced cooperatives, livestock included) in the fall. We visited the "Red Banner" cooperative in New Strelitz County, New Brandenburg District. This cooperative completed its spring sowing plan four days earlier than last year. The feeders are discussing how to increase the milk production of dairy cows from an average of 2,000 kilograms per head per year to 2,500 kilograms. As Comrade Hoffman, the director of the cooperative, was introducing the enthusiasm of the cooperative members for production this year, a man with a face full of oil suddenly came in from outside. This was a tractor driver. He had not slept all night in order to repair the temporarily malfunctioning tractor and was still busy looking for parts. Comrade Hoffman said: "This is also an example of high production enthusiasm. In previous years, if the tractor broke down, the tractor driver would have gone home to rest long ago and waited for the repairman to fix it before returning to work. This year, they are all taking the initiative to find ways to fix the machine." This year, the proportion of the two-shift work system for tractors implemented in the Republic has increased nearly twofold compared with the past, and advanced areas have even begun the three-shift work system. There has also been a significant increase in the production of livestock products. Gruneberg, Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Socialist Unity Party, said in the summary of the Eighth Plenary Session that the whole Republic slaughtered 11.8% more livestock, 8.4% more milk, and 23.1% more eggs in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year.

    These new atmospheres are just the beginning of a series of victories for complete collectivization. The recently concluded Eighth Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party studied the consolidation and further development of agricultural production cooperatives from all aspects and put forward many specific measures to increase agricultural and livestock production. Industry has been mobilized to help the development of agricultural production, and cultural and educational undertakings have also begun to adapt to the new situation of complete collectivization and arrange their work. Thousands of urban youths have begun to go to the countryside to support the socialist construction of agriculture. The democratic parties in the National Front have also held meetings to decide to make helping agriculture their first task. The mental outlook of the countryside and the relationships between people have also begun to undergo new changes with complete collectivization. What a rapid and profound change this is! People are fully convinced that the farmers of the German Democratic Republic, following the correct path pointed out by the Socialist Unity Party, relying on the power of collectivization, will overcome all obstacles and difficulties in their progress, and in the near future, push the already highly developed agricultural production to a more advanced level and build the new socialist countryside more prosperously.

    不平凡的春天	本报记者　张辛民
    3月初，春天刚刚降临到德意志民主共和国的大地，农业合作化运动的高潮就在波罗的海之滨的罗斯托克专区出现了。只一个多月的时间，全国十四个专区中已有十三个宣布全部合作化。共和国的首都柏林目前虽然还有一半以上的土地被西方国家占领，但民主区郊区的农民也在4月初宣布全体参加农业生产合作社。人们可以预料，不用更多时间，就会传来全国合作化的喜讯。
    全部合作化，这是六十年代第一个春天社会主义在德意志民主共和国农村中一个巨大的胜利。这个胜利不是偶然的。第一个全部合作化了的罗斯托克专区人民委员会主席提施同志，在向记者介绍这个专区农村全部合作化的情况时说：全部合作化是长期工作的结果。从1952年这个专区开始办农业生产合作社以来，一直坚持不懈地进行工作，1953年6月17日反革命暴乱没有影响到领导的决心，尽管合作社只是逐步在发展，但合作化的方向始终没有动摇。去年年底全区合作化的耕地已经超过60％，成为全国合作化程度比较高的专区。全区合作社每个劳动日现金收入平均达到八点七六马克，合作社的优越性日益被农民看到。此外，国际形势向着有利于和平和社会主义的方向发展，社会主义阵营日益强大，德意志民主共和国日益巩固，都有助于提高农民的觉悟。同时，随着居民生活水平的提高，对畜产品的需要大大增加，增加了进口的负担。必须把个体经济改造为社会主义大生产方式，才能提高本国农业生产，才能在按人口平均的消费量和劳动生产率方面赶上和超过西德。这种必要性也加强了领导上推动合作化运动加速发展的决心。
    当然，这些必要和可能，并不是罗斯托克一个专区仅有的，整个共和国在客观上都具备着同样的条件和要求。去年12月统一社会党七中全会后，各个专区党委都举行了会议讨论合作化的问题。许多专区把它做为中心工作，其他各项工作都环绕它来进行。中央派出了工作组，帮助专区进行工作。在一些专区中，大部分党和政府的机关干部都下了乡，工人们也都行动起来，一支千军万马的队伍为促进合作化运动深入农村发动农民。合作社主席、党的支部书记、乡村干部和党员积极分子更是运动中的骨干，他们每天找还没有入社的农民谈心，给他们讲应该参加合作社的道理。客观上的需要和可能，加上主观上的艰苦工作，就使得合作化运动的速度超过了人们原来的想像。在德意志民主共和国，最近流行着一句话：“苹果熟透了”。人们以此来说明当前合作化运动的迅速发展是具备着成熟的条件的。
    农村合作化的胜利，是在战胜西德和西柏林的敌人进行的各种破坏活动而得到的。西德和西柏林的统治集团无时无刻不在寻找机会反对德意志民主共和国。德意志民主共和国的每一项进步的措施，他们都恨之入骨。合作化自然更不例外。无线电、电视机在德意志民主共和国农村是很普遍的。他们便通过广播、电视大造其谣，西柏林美国占领区的里亚斯电台在这个煽动中更是十分积极。气球也飘到德意志民主共和国上空来散传单捣乱。报刊更是每天充满了流言蜚语。
    针对西德和西柏林敌人的煽动宣传，思想工作就更需要加强。新勃兰登堡专区党委宣传部部长毕亚克同志对记者说：在这次运动中，专区领导早就估计到敌人的破坏，因此事先就针对群众的思想，把政策向干部和群众交代清楚，并且不断研究群众思想的发展，及时加以解释，这样就使敌人的破坏扑了空。对敌人总要采取攻势，才能取得主动。在这个运动中，我们总是走在前面，敌人总是落后一步。
    在群众自己行动起来形成了声势浩大的革命运动面前，各种阴谋破坏活动都被粉碎揭穿了。有的富农几年前逃到西柏林，一直通过代理人破坏农业生产合作社的发展，在这次运动中也被揭露出来。许多今天生活富裕的农民，想起十五年前他们还是没有寸土的农业工人或移民时，都表示决不能再让容克地主回来。
    在这次合作化运动高潮中，参加合作社的有相当大一部分是被人们称为“殷实户”的富裕农民。发动这些人参加合作社的确不是一件简单的事。几年来，他们依靠着人强马壮牛多，标榜着个体经营是农业生产中最好的方式。在全部合作化前，他们中间有人还订同盟，打赌发誓决不参加合作社。但是，曾几何时，他们都改变立场，成了合作社的社员。是一股什么力量促使他们参加合作社呢？敌人造谣硬说是“赶进去”的。罗斯托克专区人民委员会主席提施同志说得好：“我们可没有这么大的力量在这样短的期间把上万农民‘赶进’合作社中去啊！”格利姆县拉口乡的毛伦茨家是一个很好的说明。毛伦茨夫妻两人种着十五公顷地，养了七条大奶牛，还有不少肥猪，去年一年现金收入有一万八千多马克。生活虽然富裕，可是毛伦茨太太每天得干十五、六小时的重活。不久前，她参观了先进的合作社后，眼界豁然开朗，合作社里人多机器多，劳动完了还有文化生活，社员们有时聚会谈心，孩子也有幼儿园照管。毛伦茨太太看见了合作化的远景，再也不愿意一辈子成天守在牛栏、猪圈里了。在这次合作化运动高潮中，她成了积极分子，和丈夫一道参加了合作社，还被选为社务委员。在波罗的海边的利布尼克—堤园县的巴尔特港乡，我们遇见了一位姓菲克的农民。菲克夫妻二人也有十五公顷地，养着五条奶牛、二十口猪，家里还有摩托车，去年收入两万多马克。1952年乡里办了合作社，他就在一旁观察盘算。去年，照他说，整整想了一年，入社呢，舍不得自己的牲畜土地归公；不入吧，村里别家又先后参加，剩下自己一家也不好办。夫妻俩不知开了多少家庭会，最后还是儿子帮助做出了决定。小菲克在国营农场做工，决心将来不继承父亲的土地遗产。这样一来，菲克先生一盘算，留着财产做什么呢？老两口都已五十，还能在地里劳动几年呢？还是参加合作社好。
    几个月来，共和国的农村到处展开着辩论。合作社员们用种种事实说明合作社的优越性，说明国家对发展农业生产的需要，而个体经营已不能满足这种需要了。参加合作社已成为真正的潮流。
    是谁在几个月内把二十万左右农民“赶进”合作社中去的？很清楚，是这些农民自己看到了远景，认清了大势所趋，选择了自己应当走的道路。
    刚刚全部合作化了的农村，已经出现了一片新气象。大部地区在天气较旱的条件下比去年提前完成了春播。最近全部合作化的几个专区更是一面春播、一面进行合作化。许多新成立的一型合作社（初级社，牲畜不入社）正在筹划建立大牛厩、猪圈，准备秋后晋级为三级社（高级社，牲畜入社）。我们访问了新勃兰登堡专区的新施特雷茨县的“红锦标”合作社。这个社比去年提前四天完成了春播计划，饲养队员们正在讨论如何使奶牛产奶量从每头平均年产二千公斤提高到二千五百公斤。当社主任郝夫曼同志给我们介绍今年合作社社员的生产热情时，忽然从外边进来了一个满脸油泥的人。这是一个拖拉机手，他为了修理临时出了毛病的拖拉机，整夜没有睡觉，现在还在忙着找零件。郝夫曼同志说：“这也是一个生产积极性高涨的实例。往年拖拉机坏了，拖拉机手早就回家休息，等修理工修好了再回来工作，今年都是自己主动想办法把机器修好。”今年在共和国实行拖拉机两班工作制的比例较过去提高将近一倍，先进地区甚至开始了三班工作制。在畜产品商品生产方面，也有了显著增长。统一社会党中央书记处书记格吕纳贝格在八中全会总结中说，全共和国在今年第一季度屠宰牲畜较去年同期增长11.8％，牛奶增长8.4％，鸡蛋增加23.1％。
    这些新气象不过是全部合作化一连串胜利的开始。最近闭幕的统一社会党八中全会从各方面研究了农业生产合作社的巩固和进一步发展的问题，提出了增加农畜生产的许多具体措施。工业动员起来帮助农业生产发展，文化教育事业也开始适应全合作化的新形势，安排自己的工作。成千上万的城市青年开始下乡支援农业社会主义建设。全国阵线中的各民主党派也都开会决定把帮助农业作为自己的第一项任务。农村的精神面貌和人与人之间的关系，也开始随着全部合作化发生着新的变化。这是一个多么迅速而又深刻的变化！人们完全相信，德意志民主共和国的农民沿着统一社会党所指出的正确道路，依靠合作化的力量，将会战胜前进中的一切障碍和困难，在不久的将来，把已经高度发达了的农业生产推向更加先进的水平，把社会主义新农村建设的更加繁荣。
