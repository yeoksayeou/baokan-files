(Our report from Chongqing, April 25) The Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, through mobilizing the masses to vigorously summarize and coordinate advanced experiences, has broken through the various weak links that emerged in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. This has allowed them to rapidly achieve a new balance after breaking the old balance between workshops, sections, groups, and processes, effectively promoting production.

During the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the degree of mechanization and automation in cold processing improved rapidly, which made the backwardness of departments such as forging, casting, and transportation even more prominent. Therefore, the factory leaders selected the casting workshop, the forging workshop, and the transportation department; the workshops then selected key processes or groups. Responsibilities were assigned at different levels, and efforts were concentrated on making breakthroughs. In the weak links, equipment was matched, and technical operational experience was coordinated, to quickly raise the backward areas to an advanced level. Once forging, casting, transportation, and assembly were improved, inspection and design and other management departments became weak links. In these two departments, they vigorously promoted the experiences of the masses. In inspection, instrumentation, mechanization, and semi-mechanization were realized, and in the design department, drawing mechanization, tracing chemicalization, and blueprinting automation were achieved.

The Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory adopted the method of workers summarizing their own operations, several people summarizing everyone's operations, and special personnel summarizing major experiences, ensuring that every experience was summarized. According to incomplete statistics, more than 50% of the workers participated in the great summary work, and a total of more than 2,000 advanced technical experiences were summarized. After the mass summary, a three-way combination technical appraisal was conducted from the factory to the workshop. The three-way combination appraisal team, composed of leading cadres, workers, and engineering technical personnel, comprehensively compared these experiences—comparing operational convenience, comparing reduced effort and increased efficiency, and comparing the value of promotion. Then, they comprehensively drew on strengths and made up for weaknesses to modify, finalize, and coordinate the various experiences. Finally, after being approved by the leadership, they were incorporated into the process regulations for implementation. In the past four months, the factory has summarized a total of 721 sets of advanced experiences and more than 120 kinds of new technical data for various machine tools.

    针对薄弱环节抓经验配套
    建设机床厂总结出七百多套经验各工序实现积极的平衡
    本报重庆25日电　重庆建设机床厂通过发动群众大搞先进经验的总结配套，突破技术革新和技术革命运动中出现的各个薄弱环节，使车间与车间、工段与工段、小组与小组、工序与工序之间在突破旧的平衡后又迅速达到了新的平衡，有力地促进了生产。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，冷加工方面机械化、自动化程度提高得很快，锻、铸、运输等部门的落后状况就显得更加突出。于是厂里领导选择了铸工车间、锻工车间和运输部门；车间又选择了关键工序或小组，分级负责，集中力量突击。在薄弱环节上，实行设备配套，技术操作经验配套，迅速把落后提高到先进的水平。锻、铸、运输、装配突上去了，检验、设计等管理部门又成为薄弱环节。在这两个部门中，他们又大力推广群众的经验。检验方面实现了仪表化、机械化、半机械化，设计部门实现了制图机械化、描图化学化、晒图联动化。
    重庆建设机床厂采用工人自己操作自己总结，几人操作大家总结，重大经验专人总结的方法，做到了个个经验有总结。据不完全统计，有50％以上的工人参加了大总结的工作，共总结出二千多项先进技术经验。群众性大总结之后，从厂到车间进行三结合技术鉴定，由领导干部、工人和工程技术人员组成的三结合鉴定小组对这些经验进行综合比较——比操作方便，比费事少工效高，比推广价值大，然后综合取长补短对各项经验进行修改、定型和配套，最后经领导批准纳入工艺规程加以贯彻。最近四个月来，全厂共总结出来成套的先进经验七百二十一套，各种机床的新的技术资料一百二十多种。
