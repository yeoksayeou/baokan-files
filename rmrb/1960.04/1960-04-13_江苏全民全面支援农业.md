Jiangsu Comprehensively Supports Agriculture with Full Participation
Industrial departments have basically completed the manufacturing and repair of agricultural implements needed for spring plowing, spring planting, summer harvesting, and summer planting.
Many factories, financial and trade units, cultural and educational units, etc., have respectively established cooperative partnerships with communes and brigades to carry out a grand competition to support agriculture.

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 12th dispatch) The mass movement of universal support for agriculture, which is vigorously unfolding in various parts of Jiangsu Province, has recently seen new developments. In all cities and towns throughout the province, industry, commerce, education, the military, men and women, young and old, all trades and professions are doing their best to comprehensively, regularly, and proactively support agriculture, bringing the relationship between workers and peasants, and between urban and rural areas, to a new stage.

The first important characteristic of the current mass movement to support agriculture in Jiangsu Province is comprehensive support, including industry, finance and trade, transportation, science and culture, education and health, government organs and the military, and even street residents; from agricultural implements, machinery, electricity, fuel, fertilizers, pesticides, building materials, transportation tools, technical personnel, to imparting cultural and scientific knowledge, enriching farmers' cultural and recreational life, etc. By the end of March, the province's industrial departments had completed or basically completed the manufacturing and repair tasks of various agricultural implements needed for spring plowing, spring planting, and summer harvesting and summer planting for 1,545 communes across the north and south of the Yangtze River. The province's commercial system accelerated the procurement of agricultural production materials. The supply of chemical fertilizers increased by 67% compared to the same period last year, and the supply of pesticides for the prevention and treatment of wheat diseases and insect pests doubled compared to the same period last year. The supply of various power-driven machines and accessories also increased by three to seven times compared to last year. Financial system cadres went deep into the countryside to arrange the annual production funds for all communes and 96% of the production brigades. Scientific research departments are concentrating their efforts on studying the prevention of wheat scab and rust, the prevention of rice lodging, the reduction of cotton boll shedding, and the prevention and treatment of swine fever, among other issues. Other trades and professions and units are also doing their best to support agriculture. Currently, Changzhou City has 406 factories, 90 commercial enterprises, 23 schools, 12 hospitals, 7 scientific research institutes, 5 construction work areas, 2 theatrical troupes, 3 public institutions, and 20 residents' committees that have established cooperative partnerships with neighboring communes and production brigades to do their best to support agriculture.

The second characteristic of the current support agriculture in Jiangsu Province, is the transformation from rush actions to a regularized mass movement. In most cities throughout the province, from the municipal and district party committees to the party committees of larger factories and mines and schools, specialized agencies led by secretaries have been established to lead the work of supporting agriculture. In accordance with the spirit of "agriculture as the foundation," various forms of cooperative partnerships such as city-county, factory-commune, school-commune, institute-commune, and store-commune are adopted to conduct investigations and research, clarify needs, and formulate comprehensive plans for the region and unit to support agriculture. Many factories, after establishing cooperative partnerships with communes, incorporate the commune's agricultural technical transformation plan into their own factory's production plan. At present, more than 3,400 factories in Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou and other cities, as well as Zhenjiang and Suzhou, have adopted the "one-stop" method of "guaranteeing design, equipment installation, and technical competence" to help nearly 800 people's communes and production brigades establish more than 2,500 various factories for agricultural tool repair, pesticide, and fertilizer production. The factories have also used methods such as "inviting, sending, training, and guiding" to help counties and communes train more than 10,000 technical workers in stages and batches.

The active and proactive support of agriculture by all sectors of society is the third characteristic. The machinery industry has completed the repair and assembly of waterwheels in the province a quarter ahead of schedule. The transportation departments have also delivered large quantities of materials to the countryside ahead of schedule. In order to more actively support the countryside, many units sent machines to the communes, technology to the factories, fertilizer to the fields, culture to the door, and materials to the countryside, competing with each other to see who contributed more to supporting agriculture. Wuxi City recently transferred more than 1,000 leading cadres, engineering technicians, and veteran workers to work in the communes for a long time. In the half month after arriving in the countryside, they have helped the communes in Wuxi County build and expand 45 agricultural machinery factories, so that all communes in the county have agricultural machinery factories and every factory has technicians. Wherever they go, the raging fire of technical revolution is ignited. Since the beginning of this year, Changzhou City has launched six consecutive mass movements to send fertilizer to the countryside. Thousands of troops and horses, thousands of loads, and hundreds of thousands of people have participated in this movement. The commercial system not only strengthened the procurement and supply of agricultural implements, fertilizers, and pesticides, but also actively cooperated with the industrial and handicraft departments to establish 3,200 agricultural implement repair stations, and helped the communes establish 110,000 local pesticide and fertilizer manufacturing plants. The financial system not only actively helped the communes and production teams arrange production funds, but also helped them open up avenues, find resources, develop diversified operations, and increase commune income.

The enthusiastic support of the cities for the countryside has greatly encouraged the political enthusiasm and production initiative of the broad masses of farmers. They are determined to achieve greater leaps forward on the agricultural front, to produce more grain, cotton, oil, and various agricultural and sideline products to support the development of urban industry and meet the needs of the people's lives.

    工商学兵大动员　各行各业齐出力
    江苏全民全面支援农业
    工业部门已基本完成支援农业春耕春种夏收夏种所需农具的制造和修配任务
    许多工厂、财贸、文教等单位分别与公社、大队挂钩协作开展支援农业大竞赛
    本报南京12日电　江苏省各地蓬勃掀开的普遍支援农业的群众运动，最近以来又有了新的发展。在全省的各个市镇中，工商学兵，男女老少，各行各业，各尽其力，全面地、经常地、主动地支援农业，使工农关系、城乡关系进入了一个新的阶段。
    当前江苏省支援农业的群众运动的第一个重要特点是全面支援，包括从工业、财贸、交通运输、科学文化、教育卫生，机关部队，一直到街道居民，从农具、机械、电力、燃料、肥料、农药、建筑材料、运输工具、技术力量，一直到传授文化科学知识，丰富农民的文娱生活等等。到3月底，全省工业部门已经为大江南北一千五百四十五个公社完成和基本完成了春耕春种和夏收夏种所需要的各种农具的制造和修配任务。全省商业系统加快了农业生产资料的采购进度，化肥的供应量比去年同期增加了67％，防治三麦病虫害的农药供应量比去年同期增加了一倍。各种动力机具和配件的供应量也比去年增加了三倍到七倍。金融系统的广大干部深入农村，为所有的公社和96％的生产大队安排了全年的生产资金。科学研究部门正在集中力量研究防止小麦赤霉病、秆锈病、防止水稻倒伏、减少棉花落铃和防治猪瘟等问题。其它各行各业、各单位也都尽力支援农业。常州市目前已经有四百零六个工厂、九十个商业企业、二十三所学校、十二个医院、七个科学研究所、五个建筑工区、两个剧团、三个事业单位、二十个居民委员会，分别与邻近的公社和生产大队挂钩协作，尽力支援。
    当前江苏省支援农业的第二个特点，是从突击的行动发展到经常化的群众运动。全省多数的城市，从市委、区委到较大的厂矿、学校的党委，都设立了由书记挂帅的专门机构，领导支援农业的工作。根据“农字当头”的精神，通过市县、厂社、校社、院社、店社等多种多样挂钩协作的形式，调查研究，摸清需要，制订出本地区、本单位支援农业的全面规划。许多工厂与公社挂钩以后，就把挂钩社农业技术改造的规划，列入本厂的生产计划之内。目前南京、无锡、常州等市，和镇江、苏州等专区已有三千四百多个工厂，采取包设计、包设备安装、包技术过关等“一包到底”的办法，帮助近八百个人民公社和生产大队办起了农具修配、农药、肥料等各种工厂二千五百多个；各工厂还通过“请、派、训、带”等方法分期分批地帮助县社培养了一万多名技术工人。
    各行各业积极主动支援农业是第三个特点。机械工业已经提前一个季度完成了全省戽水机的修配任务。交通运输部门也已提早把大批的物资运往农村。为了更主动地支援农村，许多单位送机器到社，送技术进厂，送肥料下田，送文化上门，送物资下乡，相互比赛，看谁为支援农业贡献大。无锡市最近抽调了一千多名领导干部、工程技术人员和老工人，到公社去长期工作，在下乡后半个多月时间内，已经帮助无锡县各公社新建和扩建了农业机械厂四十五个，使全县所有公社都有农机厂、厂厂有技术员，他们到哪里，那里就燃起了技术革命的熊熊烈火。常州市在今年以来连续开展了六次送肥下乡的全民运动，千军万马，千挑万担，先后有四十三万人参加了这一运动。商业系统不但加强了农具、肥料、农药的采购和供应工作，还主动地配合工业、手工业部门建立了三千二百个农具修配站，帮助公社新办了十一万个土农药和土化肥制造厂；金融系统不但积极地帮助公社和生产队安排生产资金，还帮助开门路、找资源，发展多种经营，增加公社收入。
    城市对农村的热情的支援，大大鼓舞了广大农民的政治热情和生产积极性。他们决心在农业战线上实现更大的跃进，以生产更多的粮食、棉花、油料以及各种农副产品，来支援城市工业的发展，满足人民生活的需要。
