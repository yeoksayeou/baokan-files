    A Nursery for Agricultural Talent
    ——Visiting the Kai'an Agricultural Middle School in Jilin Province
    By our reporter Bai Sheng
    Flowers Bloom in the Great Leap Forward

    Kai'an, located about fifty li north of Changchun City, was originally the site of the Wanbaoshan Incident, the fuse of the "Northeast Incident." Today, it is a red flag township for agricultural middle schools throughout Jilin Province.
    When we arrived at the Kai'an Agricultural Middle School with Yu Rongjiu, Secretary of the Nong'an County Party Committee, and Li Baoshan, Secretary of the Kai'an People's Commune, the students were having their morning classes. The air was very fresh in the open campus, and the classrooms in several thatched mud houses were filled with students listening attentively. The teachers were seriously explaining the texts on the platform. Several principals and teachers told us kindly that, in addition to the students listening in the classrooms, many students were working on the school's farm and in its factories.
    This new type of school was established in April 1958, during the Great Leap Forward. Like many agricultural middle schools across the country, it is a flower blooming in the rural areas during the Great Leap Forward.
    When talking about the establishment of Kai'an Agricultural Middle School, Commune Secretary Li Baoshan told us a story:
    It was the spring of 1958, when Kai'an Township was undertaking a large-scale water conservancy project. When digging ditches and opening paddy fields, everyone did not understand the technology, and could not measure earthwork or calculate water volume. As a result, they took a big detour, causing a waste of man-hours. The old ditches that could have been used were not utilized, wasting more than seven thousand labor days in vain. Faced with this fact, and considering Kai'an Township's plan to achieve the Great Leap Forward goals of mechanization and electrification within two or three years, how could this be achieved without technical talent! Therefore, the Kai'an Township Party Committee made up its mind to start its own school during the Great Leap Forward.
    In the process of deciding to run the school, the vast majority of cadres and the masses actively supported and agreed, and many high school graduates who had not entered school warmly welcomed it. Commune member Guo Lianke hurried to register his two daughters. However, before the decision to start the school, some ideological concerns also arose among a few cadres and the masses. For example, some cadres were afraid that it would affect production and reduce commune members' income; some parents and students were worried that the quality of teachers in agricultural middle schools was poor and the school equipment was not good, so they would not learn anything. Some even thought that agricultural middle schools were unsophisticated and that entering an agricultural middle school was not promising, saying that agricultural middle schools would not last long. Faced with these ideological problems, the Party Committee studied the ideological situation on the one hand and convened mass meetings on the other hand. Through propaganda, education, and debate, they improved the ideological understanding of cadres and the masses, dispelled the concerns of a few people, and strengthened their confidence in running the school.
    The commune first helped the agricultural middle school solve the problem of school buildings. After publicity, the masses eagerly hoped that the agricultural middle school would become a good school for cultivating their children. So everyone contributed labor if they had it, and materials if they had them. Various organs and the masses also sent things to the school with gongs and drums. Nong'an Third Middle School, across from Kai'an Agricultural Middle School, sent desks, Kai'an Primary School sent benches, the supply and marketing cooperative sent paper, pens, and ink, and the iron factory sent kettles. One parent even sent a grandfather clock. In this way, an agricultural middle school that started from scratch was established under the leadership of the Township Party Committee and with the enthusiastic support of the masses. Li Baoshan, the first secretary of the Township Party Committee, also served as the principal of the agricultural middle school.

    Teaching Catches Up with Ordinary Middle Schools
    Faced with the difficulties of the newly built school, the teachers and students were not discouraged, but their confidence and enthusiasm for running the agricultural middle school became greater and greater, and their teaching enthusiasm became higher and higher. If there were not enough classrooms, they would have classes on the labor field. If there was no cafeteria, they would eat in the open air. After a short period of production labor, they not only built classrooms, dormitories, and a cafeteria, but also increased their income. The school used the money to buy teaching supplies. Now, this school has grown from seventy-two students at the beginning to more than three hundred students. Teachers get up early and go to bed late, teach diligently, and students study hard and diligently read. In order to improve teaching quality in every possible way and catch up with ordinary middle schools, the school put forward the slogan "Teaching Catch Up with Ordinary Middle Schools, Production Must Achieve High Yield." In correctly implementing the Party's education policy, the school properly arranged teaching and production labor time, adhered to the half-work and half-study system, and ensured that teaching and production were not delayed, and teaching quality was continuously improved. In just two years, the teaching quality of this agricultural middle school has caught up with that of ordinary middle schools.
    Last October, the Nong'an County Party Committee conducted a comparative examination of the students in each class of the second grade of Kai'an Agricultural Middle School and Nong'an Third Middle School. As a result, the scores of the two schools in Chinese were similar, both above 70 points, while the math score of Kai'an Agricultural Middle School was more than 20 points higher than that of Nong'an Third Middle School, with an average score of 86.5 points. In January of this year, the Nong'an County Education Bureau conducted a comparative examination of the three major basic courses of Chinese, mathematics, and physics and chemistry between Kai'an Agricultural Middle School and ten full-time ordinary middle schools in the county. As a result, the scores of the first and second grades of Kai'an Agricultural Middle School in mathematics, Chinese, and physics and chemistry caught up with those of nine ordinary middle schools in the county, and the scores of the second grade in physics were the same as the average scores of the second grade in physics in ten ordinary middle schools in the county.
    The continuous improvement of the teaching quality of Kai'an Agricultural Middle School is inseparable from the frequent in-depth and specific guidance of the Kai'an Commune Party Committee to the school, and the strengthening of ideological education for teachers and students. In order to run the agricultural middle school well, the Commune Party Committee is always concerned about the growth of the agricultural middle school. From teaching to production, the Party Committee conducts directional inspections at any time. In order to catch up with ordinary middle schools in teaching, the school has established ties with Nong'an Third Middle School, and teachers are often organized to go to Third Middle School to listen to lectures. The teachers are constantly improving their teaching methods and enriching the teaching content. For example, in Chinese teaching, in order to combine labor with the basic training of Chinese lessons, after the teacher finished teaching the lesson "On Changbai Mountain", when working with students in the fertile fields covered with green mountains and fields, the teacher combined this lesson to guide the students to read the text aloud, which not only expressed the thoughts and feelings of each student, but also deeply reviewed this lesson. When resting from work, the teachers and students enjoyed the scenery of nature together. At this time, the teacher consciously inspired the students to talk freely about their true feelings about nature. As a result, the students collectively wrote a poem:
    The scenery on the banks of the Yitong River is beautiful, with green mountains and clear waters reflecting each other.
    The river smiles and climbs up the hillside, and the valley rice is fragrant all over the mountains and fields.
    People are moving under the white clouds, and songs and laughter fill the mountains.
    Here, without the scene of labor and real feelings, without the guidance of teachers, students could not have written such vivid verses all at once. Once, a Chinese teacher led students to work in the fields. When resting, they observed the school's high-yield fields. The teacher consciously guided the students to appreciate the crops that were about to be harvested, and to appreciate the scenery of the fields before the harvest. After watching, the students deeply felt the greatness of labor and the joy of harvest. From the scene of labor and harvest in the fields, to the villages with cooking smoke rising in the distance and the white clouds floating in the distant sky, they all felt exceptionally lovely from the bottom of their hearts. After returning to school, the content of students' compositions was very rich, and their feelings were exceptionally sincere. They wrote many good articles.
    The school's production labor is always at the forefront. When we visited Kai'an Agricultural Middle School, some students were working hard in the woodworking factory, some were weaving mats, and some were bundling brooms and sewing clothes. Some students were busy preparing for spring planting. Several large vehicles of the school were also out transporting things. The school's production base is very large, with a farm of 25 hectares and small woodworking factories, soil fertilizer factories, weaving factories, and sewing factories. It also raises livestock, poultry, and bees. In the past two years, the farm has successively achieved high yields and harvests, and has become a high-yield field for the commune. The school's economy is completely self-sufficient. Through labor practice, students not only master a complete set of agricultural production techniques from spring plowing to autumn harvest, but also enrich the knowledge they have learned from books.
    In order to combine teaching and production with scientific research, the school has also established more than a dozen scientific research groups. We especially visited the weather station of the meteorological group, which regularly reports daily climate changes to the commune, which is of great help to agricultural production. The pesticide research group researched and trial-produced "mixed insecticide" to kill the "green vegetable worms" and "aphids" of crops, with a killing efficiency of more than 98%. The horticulture group tested the method of inserting bamboo sticks into corn to make the corn produce more cobs, and used artificial pollination to make the corn yield 1,237 catties per mu, exceeding the local yield. They also studied pumpkin pollination, pressing vines to apply fertilizer, so that each plant produced eight or nine large pumpkins, and the plant with the most melons produced twelve. The cadres and commune members all said that Kai'an Agricultural Middle School has become the commune's agricultural science research institute, seed breeding station, and technology promotion station. Even the old Qiutou, who was most unconvinced that the agricultural middle school children could achieve high yields and grow wheat, personally saw the scene of the wheat harvest in the agricultural middle school, and praised it repeatedly: "Your agricultural middle school children still have a way, I have lived for more than seventy years and never seen a wheat harvest in Kai'an. The old man has finally admitted defeat." Now Kai'an Agricultural Middle School has become a solid base combining teaching, productive labor, and scientific research.
    Teachers Who Love Agricultural Middle School
    Wang Shuqin is a young female teacher at Kai'an Agricultural Middle School. She graduated from Changchun Normal School two years ago and was assigned from the city to this rural agricultural middle school to teach. This girl with two braids is hard to tell apart from her students if you stand with them. When we went to visit Kai'an Agricultural Middle School, she was playing ball with the students on the playground.
    When Wang Shuqin first came to the agricultural middle school, she took on the physics class for the whole school. There was a period when the school was busy with production, and classes often had to be held at the Qiujiatun labor site, which was five miles away from the campus. Every day she had to walk a long stretch of farmland. In September of last year, one day the sky was heavily overcast, dark clouds were gathering, and heavy rain was about to fall, but two classes of students in Qiujiatun were waiting for her to teach. Should she go or not? At this time, more than a hundred faces expecting the teacher to give a lecture and more than a hundred pairs of expectant eyes staring at her immediately appeared in front of her. She picked up two textbooks and walked out without looking back. The leaders asked her to stop, but she didn't hear them. Sure enough, on the way, heavy rain poured down. For a while, her umbrella was also blown away by the strong wind, and the rain fell on her body, soaking her clothes all over. The water flowed down her body, making her shiver all over. The road was slippery, and she fell several times, covered in mud. But when she rushed to Qiujiatun in the heavy rain, she saw the students rushing to meet her in the rain. She was really touched at that time. Some students rushed to take off their clothes and give them to her, and some were busy getting her shoes and socks. The students' kind, enthusiastic, and simple feelings for her made her teach the lesson that day particularly vividly and brilliantly. She assured the Party Committee that she was determined to dedicate her youth to the agricultural middle school. In order to teach her students well, she often prepared lessons for them late at night or early in the morning, and often asked experienced teachers from Nong'an Third Middle School for advice. In the evening, she squeezed out time to go to the student dormitory to help students make up lessons. When students labored, she also went to the field to work with them.
    Like Wang Shuqin, the teachers of Kai'an Agricultural Middle School have deep feelings for the agricultural middle school. They are determined to be red in the agricultural middle school and specialize in the agricultural middle school.
    The agricultural middle school established by Kai'an Commune has only been two years, and it has already taken root in the countryside. This new seedling is growing vigorously under the warm sunshine of the Party. In another year, the first batch of agricultural talents will be transferred to various positions in the commune. The establishment of this agricultural middle school is just as Comrade Lu Dingyi said: "For many years, secondary education has not been able to enter the countryside, and middle school students cannot be retained in the countryside, but... in our socialist society, agricultural middle schools have been established for two years, and junior middle school education has taken root in the countryside... This is a very remarkable thing." (Attached picture) Chen Zhi Illustration

    农业人材的苗圃
    ——访吉林省开安农业中学
    本报记者　柏生
      鲜花开在跃进中
    长春城北郊约五十多里的开安，原是“东北事变”的导火线万宝山旧址。如今却是吉林全省农业中学的一面红旗乡。
    当我们和农安县委于荣久书记，开安人民公社李宝山书记一起到达开安农业中学时，学生们正在上早课。开阔的校园里，空气十分清新，几间茅草土房的教室里，都坐满了安静听讲的学生，教师正认真地在讲台上讲解着课文。几位校长和教师亲切地告诉我们，除了教室里听讲的学生，还有许多学生正在学校的农场和工厂里劳动。
    这座新型的学校，是在大跃进的1958年的4月建立起来的，她和全国许多农业中学一样，是大跃进中农村开放的一朵鲜花。
    谈起了开安农中的创办，公社李宝山书记给我们讲述了一段经过：
    那还是1958年的春天，开安乡大兴水利工程，在挖沟和开水田时，因为大家不懂技术，不会量土方、算水量，结果走了一大段弯路，造成窝工浪费现象。原来可以利用的旧沟也没利用，白白浪费了七千多个劳动日。面对着这个事实，再加上开安乡计划要在两、三年内实现机械化、电气化的跃进目标，在这种情况下，没有技术人材怎么能成呢！于是，开安乡党委便下了决心，一定要在跃进中办起自己的学校。
    在决定办学的过程中，绝大多数干部和群众都积极支持和赞成，许多没入学的高小毕业生更是热烈欢迎。社员郭连科赶忙就给两个女儿报了名。但是在决定开办前，在少数干部和群众中也出现了一些思想顾虑，如有的干部怕影响生产，怕减少社员收入；部分家长和学生担心农业中学教师质量差，学校设备不好，学不到什么东西，有的甚至认为农业中学土里土气，入农业中学没出息，说农业中学寿命不长。面对着这些思想问题，党委一面研究了思想情况，一面召开了群众会议，通过宣传教育和辩论，提高了干部和群众的思想认识，解除了少数人的顾虑，增强了办学的信心。
    公社首先帮助农业中学解决了校舍问题。群众经过宣传，满怀热情地盼望着农业中学成为培养自己子弟的好学校，于是大家有工出工，有料出料。各机关和群众还敲锣打鼓给学校送东西。在开安农中对面的农安三中送来了课桌，开安小学送来了板凳，供销社送来了纸笔和墨水，铁业社送来了水壶，有个家长还送来了一架座钟。就这样，一所白手起家的农业中学，在乡党委领导和群众的热情支持下办了起来，乡党委第一书记李宝山兼任了农中校长。
    教学赶上普通中学
    迎着新建校的困难，师生们不是泄气，而是对办好农中的信心和干劲越来越大，教学热情越来越高。教室不够，他们就在劳动场地上课，没食堂，他们就在露天里吃饭。经过短期的生产劳动，他们不仅修建了教室、宿舍和食堂，还增加了一批收入，学校用这些钱买了教学用品。现在，这所学校已从初办时的七十二名学生增加到三百多名学生。教师朝起晚睡，勤恳教学，学生刻苦学习，勤勉读书。为了千方百计地提高教学质量，赶上普通中学，学校提出了“教学赶普中，生产要高产”的口号。在正确贯彻党的教育方针中，学校妥善地安排了教学和生产劳动时间，坚持了半工半读，做到了教学、生产两不误，教学质量不断提高。才只两年，现在这所农业中学的教学质量已赶上普通中学。
    去年10月，农安县委对开安农中和农安三中二年级的每一个班的学生进行了一次对比考试，结果，两个学校语文科成绩相似，都在七十分以上，而数学成绩开安农中比农安三中高二十多分，平均成绩达八十六点五分。今年1月农安县教育局对开安农中和农安全县十所全日制普通中学又一同进行了一次语文、数学、理化三大基础课的对比考试，结果，开安农中一、二年级的数学、语文、理化三科成绩分别赶上全县九所普通中学，二年级物理课成绩与全县十所普通中学二年级物理课平均分数相同。
    开安农中教学质量的不断提高，是和开安公社党委的经常深入学校具体指导，和加强对学校师生的思想教育工作分不开的。为了把农中办好，公社党委无时不在关怀着农中的成长，从教学到生产，党委随时都进行方向性的检查。为了在教学上赶普中，学校和农安三中挂了钩，经常组织教师到三中去听课。教师们更是不断地改进着教学方法，充实教学内容。例如在语文教学上，为了结合劳动进行语文课的基本训练，教师讲完“在长白山上”一课以后，和学生一起在绿遍山野的丰产田劳动时，教师就结合这课书引导学生高声朗读课文，既抒发了每个学生的思想感情，也深刻地复习了这一课书。当劳动休息时，教师和学生一起欣赏大自然的风光，这时，教师有意识地启发学生畅谈自己对大自然的真实感受，于是学生集体写诗一首：
    伊通河岸好风光，青山绿水相辉映。
    河水笑着上山坡，漫山遍野谷米香。
    白云底下人影动，歌声笑语满山岗。
    这里，如果没有劳动的场景，和真实的感受，没有教师的引导，学生不可能一下写出这样生动的诗句来。有一次语文教师领着学生在田野里劳动，休息时观察了学校的丰产田，教师有意识地引导学生观赏就要收获的庄稼，观赏丰收前田野的景象。学生在观赏后，深深感到劳动的伟大和丰收的喜悦，从田野上一片劳动和丰收的景象，直到远处炊烟缭绕的村庄和远天飘动的白云，都使他们从内心感到异常可爱。回校后学生作文内容十分丰富，感情异常真挚，写出了很多好文章。
    农中的生产劳动，更是处处走在前面。当我们访问开安农中时，有的学生正在木工厂紧张劳动，有的学生正在编织凉席，有的学生正在捆扫帚和缝衣服。还有一部分学生正忙着春播前的备耕劳动。学校的几辆大车也正出动拉运东西。学校的生产基地面积很大，有二十五公顷土地的农场和小型木工厂、土化肥厂、编织厂和缝纫厂。还饲养了家畜、家禽和蜜蜂。两年中，农场接连获得高产丰收，成为公社的丰产田。学校经济完全做到自给自足。学生通过劳动实践，不但掌握了由春耕到秋收的一整套农业生产技术，而且丰富了从书本上学到的知识。
    为了结合教学和生产进行科学研究，学校还成立了十几个科学研究小组。我们特别去参观了气象小组的气象台，这里经常向公社报告每天气候变化的情况，对农业生产的帮助很大。农药研究小组，为了杀死农作物的“青菜虫”和“腻虫”，研究和试制了“混合杀虫剂”，杀虫效率达98％以上，园艺小组试验了在苞米上插竹签的方法使苞米多结棒，并用人工授粉，使苞米亩产达一千二百三十七斤，超出了当地产量。他们还研究了南瓜授粉，压蔓追肥，使每棵结了八、九个大南瓜，结瓜最多的一棵结了十二个。公社的干部和社员都说开安农中成了公社的农业科学研究所，良种繁殖站和技术推广站了。就连最不信服农中娃儿们也能搞丰产、种小麦的老丘头，亲眼看到农中小麦丰收的情景，也连连赞扬地说：“还是你们农中娃儿们有办法，我这活了七十多岁从不见开安地方小麦丰收的老头子，也总算服输了。”现在开安农中已成为教学、生产劳动和科学研究三结合的巩固的基地。
    热爱农中的教师
    王淑琴是开安农业中学的一个年轻的女教师。她前年从长春师范学校毕业后，就从城市分配到这所乡村的农业中学来任教。这个梳着两条小辫的姑娘，如果和她的学生站在一起，你真是很难分辨出她是教师还是学生。当我们去访开安农中时，她正和学生们一起在操场上打球。
    王淑琴初来农中，便担任了全校的物理课。有一个时期学校因生产忙，上课经常要到离校园五里路远的丘家屯劳动现场去上，每天都得走上漫长的一大段庄稼地。去年9月里，有一天天阴得厉害，乌云密布，眼看大雨就要降临，可是丘家屯有两班学生都正在那里等待她上课。去呢，还是不去呢？这时在她的面前立时浮现了一百多个期待老师讲课的面孔，一百多双盼望的眼睛在盯着她。她拿起了两本教科书连头也不回就往外走，领导上要她停一下走，她也没听到。果然，走到半路上，大雨倾盆而下，一时她的雨伞也被大风刮坏了，雨水湿淋淋地落到身上，淌在她的衣服里，全身都湿透了，水顺着她的身上往下流，冷得她浑身发抖，路又滑，摔了好几跤，跌得她满身是泥。可是当她在大雨中赶到丘家屯时，一眼看到学生正冒雨赶来迎接她，她当时真感动极了。有的学生抢着把自己的衣服脱下来拿给她，有的忙着给她拿鞋拿袜，学生对她的亲切热情淳朴的感情，使她那天把课教得特别生动出色。她对党委保证决心把自己的青春贡献给农中。为了教好学生，她经常不辞辛苦地在深夜或清晨给学生准备着功课，还常常向农安三中有经验的教师请教。晚上，她挤出休息时间到学生宿舍帮助学生补习功课。学生劳动，她也一同下地劳动。
    像王淑琴一样，开安农中的教师都对农中种下了深厚的感情。他们决心红在农中，专在农中。
    开安公社办起的这所农业中学，才只两年，已经在农村里扎下根来。这株新苗，在党的温暖的阳光照耀下，茁壮地成长起来。再有一年，第一批农业人材就要输送到公社的各个岗位上。这所农业中学的举办，正像陆定一同志所说，多少年来，中等教育进不了农村，农村里也留不住中学生，可是……在我们这个社会主义社会里，农业中学办了两年，初中教育就在乡村里扎下根，……这是一件很了不起的事情。（附图片）	陈志　　插图
