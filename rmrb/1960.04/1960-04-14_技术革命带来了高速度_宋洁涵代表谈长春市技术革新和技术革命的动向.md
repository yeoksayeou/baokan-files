Presidium, fellow representatives:
	I fully agree with the reports of the three Vice Premiers, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, and the report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and will resolutely implement them in my future work.
	Now I will report to the conference on the progress of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Changchun City.
The "Four Modernizations" Movement is Broad, Expansive, and High Speed
	Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party called for opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and launching the movement to increase production and practice economy, the city's technical revolution movement has gradually unfolded. It started in the industrial sector and quickly spread to all departments, including basic construction, transportation, finance and trade, service industries, culture, education and health, and the vast countryside. The movement developed rapidly, with great momentum, and abundant fruits of innovation, and amazing events occurred constantly. At present, this technical revolution movement centered on the "Four Modernizations" is developing in a broad, in-depth, and sustained direction. From the current development of the movement, the following points should be given special attention:
	First, the movement is developing very rapidly. Some factories and enterprises have doubled their production capacity once they have achieved mechanization and automation. In just two months, the industrial system has seen 368 automated production lines, 739 continuous production lines, 2,000 automated machine tools, 118 combined automated machine tools, saving 720 pieces of equipment, and three larger factories and 40 more important workshops have developed from manual operation to mechanization and automation. At present, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the city's industrial sector has increased from 46.6% at the beginning of the year to more than 70%. During this period, the industrial system saw an average of 24 automated and continuous production lines, 47 automated machine tools, and one automated workshop appear every day. The Changchun Cigarette Factory, where manual operation accounted for a considerable proportion, basically achieved mechanization and automation in just over a month, creating 1,204 mechanized points, 1,401 automated points, 139 assembly lines, and 192 automatic production lines. In just over a month, the basic construction department created 3,947 sets (pieces) of advanced machinery in 12 types of work, including carpentry, plumbing, steel reinforcement, and concrete, and combined them into 206 sets of advanced experience, increasing construction efficiency by about 50%. The transportation department also created and reformed 2,331 sets (pieces) of loading, unloading, and handling machinery in just one and a half months, increasing the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization from 30% to more than 60%. Among the city's more than 5,000 stevedores, more than 3,000 have been freed from heavy physical labor. At present, more than one-third of the service departments and processing departments (such as canteens, rice mills, livestock feed processing, etc.) in the vast rural areas have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization. From the current rate of development of the technical revolution movement, our plan proposed at the beginning of the year to achieve 75% mechanization and semi-mechanization throughout the year (mainly referring to several departments of industry, basic construction, and transportation) is obviously behind the situation and must be changed. It now appears that this goal may be reached and exceeded around May Day. Due to the rapid increase in the degree of mechanization, semi-mechanization, and even automation, this has not only basically solved the problem of labor shortage this year (the city's units planned to increase more than 80,000 people throughout the year at the beginning of the year, and now it seems that only more than 20,000 people can manage), but also greatly improved the production capacity of many factories and enterprises, the construction efficiency of basic construction departments, and the transportation capacity of transportation departments, even doubling it. At present, 142 factories above the district level in the city can double or more their production capacity this year.
	Secondly, it can be seen from this movement that changing manual operation to mechanization, semi-mechanization, and even automation is not as mysterious or difficult as it seems. Now it seems that almost all departments with cumbersome and heavy manual operations can achieve mechanization, semi-mechanization, and even automation. From the perspective of factories and enterprises, the realization of mechanization and automation is almost all over all types of work and processes. In the metallurgical industry, iron smelting, steelmaking, coking, raw material processing of iron and steel, steel rolling, and other departments have seen mechanization, semi-mechanization, and many continuous production lines. In the casting work type of the machinery industry, advanced equipment and machinery have appeared in large quantities in the iron smashing, loading, transporting, sand screening, and kiln loading and unloading processes that occupy the most manpower. And it is also completely possible to achieve continuous and automated production. After the casting workshop of the Xinguang Printing Machinery Factory fully realized mechanization and production continuity, it increased efficiency by more than 15 times, reduced the operating area by nearly two times, and saved half of the labor force. The cotton textile industry is widely promoting automatic shuttle changing and automatic stop warp devices, and manual slurry is changed to mechanical slurry. Cigarette production has basically achieved continuous automation. Earthwork, frozen soil excavation, plastering, and bricklaying in the basic construction department have all achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization. Even problems that have been difficult to solve for a long time have now been basically solved. Employees of the Third Construction Company of Changchun created the "sleeve mold ash bricklaying device", which can be used to lay four to five thousand bricks per person per day without pulling lines or spreading mortar, increasing efficiency by more than one time, and workers without technology can also operate it. Employees of the First Construction Company of Changchun created a frozen soil excavator, which is 75 times more efficient than manual excavation, greatly reducing labor intensity. For the plastering work type with more complex technology, two sets of machinery with high efficiency and good quality have been trial-produced, and their efficiency exceeds the national quota by two to three times respectively. The transportation department and many factories and enterprises have realized the hoisting of heavy goods, the conveyor belt of finished goods, the sliding of bulk goods, the vehicle and railization of transported goods in transportation. The electromagnetic crane successfully trial-produced by Changchun Railway Station can lift three tons of steel, solving the problem that general cranes are not easy to handle steel ingots and steel. A locomotive in the railway locomotive section has achieved "fifteen mechanizations" such as automatic coal loading, ash removal, and oil supply.
	The mechanization and semi-mechanization movement has not only developed vigorously in production enterprises, but also has yielded fruitful results in the commodity circulation system, the financial sector, the catering and service industries, and the culture, education, and health sectors. At present, mechanization and automation have successively appeared in grain and rice processing, sales, grain and oil sales, tofu making, soy milk making, vermicelli processing, rice washing, vegetable cutting, flower roll rolling, dumpling stuffing, cotton flailing, cotton clothing making, brushing, washing and dyeing, and other aspects. Even showing movies, fire brigade dispatching, bank counting banknotes, bundling banknotes, bathhouses scrubbing backs, engraving shops engraving characters, sanitation teams sweeping streets, and digging toilets can be mechanized and automated. At present, 83% of the city's grain supply stores have achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization, of which 24 grain stores have achieved automation, achieving "no scales for selling grain, and no lifting for selling oil." The "March 8th" retail department of Changchun Sixth Store has realized continuity in rolling cloth, measuring cloth, cutting cloth, calculating, and collecting money. The Health Hotel has developed an automatic door lock with electric switches, which can be managed by one person for all (30) rooms. The three-wheeled fishtail sweeper made by the Nanling Street Sanitation Team has increased efficiency by 26 times. From this, it can be seen that the realization of mechanization and automation is not such a difficult task, and not only in the industrial sector, but almost everywhere where there are cumbersome and heavy manual operations, mechanization, semi-mechanization, and automation can be realized.
	Third, the development of the movement has also made us clearly see that the potential for saving raw materials is very large, and the comprehensive utilization of raw materials is promising. Many waste materials, waste gas, waste water, and waste residue will become good raw materials that can be used. At present, the city's gas company, plywood factory, and all grain and rice processing factories, and many other factories are about to become waste-free factories. The conservation, substitution, and comprehensive utilization of raw materials not only have great potential in the light and chemical industries, but also have great potential in heavy industry. For example, in terms of changing product design and changing processes: After the product design structure of the Jiefang brand car in the automobile factory is changed, the load capacity can be increased from the original four tons to five tons, and the weight of the car body can be reduced by half a ton. After the Weights and Measures Factory changed the product design structure, each scale not only reduced nearly two-thirds of the processes, but also reduced half of the steel materials. After the electric arc furnace factory changed the original design structure of the ten-ton electric furnace, each one can be reduced from the original requirement of 102 tons of steel to 42 tons, and the quality can still meet the requirements of the original design. The Power Design Institute is studying and improving the design of thermal power plants. If this plan can be realized, building a thermal power plant in the future can save 3,100 tons of cement, more than 260 tons of steel, and reduce 4 kilometers of underground pipelines. As for the cold and hot processing and castings in the machinery industry, the potential for saving materials is also very large.
	Fourth, in a large number of innovative creations, many major new technologies and "high, large, precise, cutting-edge, and new" products have emerged. According to incomplete statistics, in just over two months, 412 major new technologies and high, large, precise, cutting-edge, and new products have appeared in the city. Among them, 332 in the industrial system. Not only in some modern factories and enterprises, but also in other enterprises and many small factories are widely used. Changchun Electric Power Bureau uses indigenous methods to trial-produce remote control, remote measurement, and remote communication devices. After the implementation of such a plan, all substations in the city, except for centralized control from one place, can be unattended. In this way, only 100 electricians in the city can replace the labor of 1,100 electricians in the past. The financial and trade departments also adopted some cutting-edge technologies. For example, many units such as Xiuli Grain Store and Mengjiatun Warehouse use electronic automatic control measuring instruments to pay grain and oil and coal; Changchun Hotel and Changchun Hardware and Materials Wholesale Station used light and electricity to create "automatic hand washers" and "automatic counters". We believe that as long as the technical revolution movement is developed more widely, deeply, and persistently, more cutting-edge technologies and high, large, precise, cutting-edge, and new products will emerge.
	The development of the movement has also made us see that large factories and large units can create amazing achievements, and small factories and small units can also create some miracles. The size of the unit is not the point, but whether there is enthusiasm. The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is a modern large enterprise. Due to the large-scale technical revolution movement, in just over two years, the production capacity has doubled without asking the state to increase investment and equipment. In addition, they are also actively trial-producing newer cutting-edge products in the automotive industry, and have achieved great results. Some small and medium-sized enterprises with simple equipment and poor technical foundations have also done amazing things in the movement. The Changchun Insulation Materials Factory not only mechanized and automated the production process of insulation bricks and refractory bricks in a very short period of time (which used to be almost all manual operations), greatly improving labor conditions and reducing costs, but they also created new kiln firing methods, which can save the country tens of thousands of tons of coal every year. Their slogan is "No coal for burning bricks, no ash when seeing fire, continuous realization, machinery flying all over the sky." Changchun Power Equipment Manufacturing Plant is a processing plant for the auxiliary equipment of power stations. The technical force is even weaker and the conditions are worse. People call this factory a four-no factory with no large machine tools, no large factory buildings, no cranes, and no large forging and casting equipment, only 37 old equipment with very poor precision. However, they dared to trial-produce and manufacture 12,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators and 75-ton boiler power equipment, and the quality fully met the standards stipulated by the state. Fifth, if it is said that "everyone can innovate technology," this is not an exaggeration. From this movement, science and technology have become the cause of the whole people. Many ordinary workers have broken into the "forbidden palace" of science and technology. Not only engineers, technicians, and researchers, school teachers, and students, but also workers in all walks of life have innovation creations this time. Not only technical personnel, but also many young apprentices who have just entered the factory, as well as female workers, shop assistants, cooks, and street women with several children... and even cadres in agencies and departments. Recently, You Fengtai, who was newly appointed as a mechanical casting engineer by Changchun Machinery Manufacturing Factory, was illiterate in the past, and now he only has five years of education. He combines learning and creation, and constantly reforms casting technology and process methods, so he created a complete set of technical experience in casting sand mold management and modeling. Another example is Liu Haimen, a young apprentice in the engine workshop of the automobile factory who has been in the factory for more than a year. With the help of veteran workers, he has realized five continuations and one automatic production line. Hou Guizhi, a female worker at Changchun Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, is a mother of five children. After 113 experiments, she overcame the technical fortress of "drug decolorization." Jiang Shulan, a housewife who entered the Changchun Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory in 1958, had to pack thousands of medicine bottles every day, and her back ached from exhaustion. In this movement, she was determined to achieve mechanization. She could not draw drawings, so she used cardboard boxes to make models. She was thinking about innovation while eating, walking, and even dreaming. After many experiments, she finally realized the mechanization of ointment packaging, increasing efficiency five times. Qi Jingwen, a sheet metal worker at Changchun Machinery Factory, is a deaf-mute. He has successively realized six innovation projects, and the minimum increase in efficiency is two times. A monk in Jiutai County also actively participated in the technical revolution movement. The rice mill he successfully trial-produced can increase efficiency by more than three times.
	Sixth, in the technical revolution movement, the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration between factories and mines, factories and enterprises and scientific research departments and schools, regions, and between urban and rural areas has been greatly developed. At present, the cooperation between various departments within factories and enterprises and between various factories and enterprises has developed from sporadic and unfixed to organized and planned comprehensive large-scale collaboration; the mass movement in the factory is more closely integrated with the mass movement outside the factory and the mass movement in scientific research departments and universities. A mass collaboration movement of the whole people has been formed. At present, more than 2,300 teachers and students in major universities and colleges have established fixed contacts with 324 units. It is precisely because of this that the technical revolution movement has developed faster, and many important products that could not be produced in the past have now been quickly trial-produced. In this movement, the cooperation and support between urban and rural areas and between factories and communes has also been greatly developed. The more important factories and enterprises and colleges and universities in the city have established fixed connections with almost all people's communes, and provide strong support to the rural technical transformation movement in terms of technology, equipment, materials, and assistance in training technical forces. It is precisely because of this that the five counties and one suburban area in Changchun area will all realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of rural service departments and logistics departments before and after May Day this year.
Technical, Production, Ideological, and Cultural Comprehensive Upsurge
	From the above-mentioned situation, it is not difficult to see that as long as we can continue to develop the technical revolution movement in a sustained manner in the future, it will not only solve some key problems we encounter in economic construction at present, but also will inevitably have a significant and far-reaching impact on the entire socialist construction cause. Below, I will talk about my understanding and experience in this regard.
	First of all, the development of the technical revolution can not only better guarantee the completion of this year's industrial and agricultural production and other tasks, but will also inevitably accelerate the development of the entire socialist construction cause. Therefore, we believe that even more amazing historical miracles of our people may still be ahead.
	From the current situation, as long as we can improve the level of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation in a timely manner, we will greatly improve production efficiency, greatly save labor, greatly reduce costs, and trial-produce a large number of high, large, precise, cutting-edge, and new products. Thus, it can not only guarantee the early and over-fulfillment of this year's national economic plan, but also make it possible for the future industrial and agricultural production and other construction causes to develop more rapidly due to the emergence of the situation of "one factory equals several factories," "one person equals several people," and the doubling of production capacity. Therefore, in view of the above situation, since 142 factories above the district level in the city already exist, and there will be more factories whose production capacity can double and several times, we consider that some of the factories that were originally planned to be newly built or expanded in two or three years can not be built or delayed, so as to use the available human, material, and financial resources to develop weak links, supplement missing links, and produce cutting-edge products under the guidance of the national overall planning. We believe that the situation in Changchun area is like this, and the situation in various parts of the country will also be like this. It can be seen that the speed of industrial and agricultural development in our country and the speed of development of other undertakings is likely not to have reached its peak, and perhaps faster and more amazing speeds are still ahead.
	Secondly, the more widespread and in-depth development of the technical revolution movement has brought about an upsurge in the cultural revolution and the accelerated development of scientific and technological research. The development of the cultural revolution and the development of scientific and technological research will inevitably further promote the continuous upsurge of the technical revolution and the greater leap forward in economic construction. Due to the development of the technical revolution, labor conditions have been greatly improved, and more labor has been saved, allowing the vast number of workers and masses to have more ample rest time, so that labor and leisure can be better combined, which is conducive to carrying out amateur cultural studies for cadres and the broad masses, and promoting the continuous upsurge of the cultural revolution.
	Due to the in-depth development of the technical revolution, the deeds of technical innovation and technical revolution have already and will continue to appear in large numbers, and there have already been and will continue to be many good things that are not yet in the current books. This will greatly promote the development of scientific and technological theory research work, and create more favorable conditions for scientific and technological theory research work. It can be seen that the development of science and technology in our country will not be very slow, but will be very fast.
	In the technical revolution movement, since the vast number of workers and the broad masses are actually engaged in scientific and technological research work, in the future, a large number of people who are willing to study and have considerable research capabilities will inevitably emerge. If they can be cultivated and improved in a timely manner, many of them will become outstanding scientific and technological experts in our country in the future. Therefore, as long as we resolutely adopt the policy of walking on two legs, the development of our scientific and technological team will also be very fast. Now, mass scientific and technological research groups have been organized in various factories. We believe that this is a good form for cultivating and improving their scientific and technological level. In addition, we also plan to further organize them and earnestly cultivate and improve them through various forms such as convening active elements representative meetings at all levels, the city's Science and Technology Commission hiring trainee researchers, and various factories appointing engineers, especially organizing them to participate in amateur and out-of-production learning.
	Third, the in-depth development of the technical revolution will also cause more good reflections on the political and ideological front.
	It is now very clear that the better the technical revolution movement is done in a place, the better the production work will be done, and the mental state of the people will also change very quickly. From the perspective of the whole city, the current national technical revolution movement is the most inspiring, the most encouraging for people's fighting spirit, and the most helpful for people to emancipate their minds. Everyone who truly understands the situation and has not lost sensitivity to real life will clearly see that: "Innovation has become a trend, and helping others is a pleasure," "Innovation has become a need in people's lives," "It has become a conscious and pleasant creative labor" (the title of the headline news on the front page of the People's Daily on March 7). Therefore, we believe that as long as we develop this movement more widely, deeply, and persistently, it will inevitably cause more good reflections in political and ideological aspects, which will inevitably further promote the accelerated development of socialist construction.

Why is the Movement Developing So Fast
	Why is the movement developing so fast?
	First of all, because under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, a great situation that has not been seen in ten years has emerged throughout the country, in Jilin Province, and even in Changchun area. Whether in cities or rural areas, it is in a better and more comprehensive leap forward situation. After the anti-rightist and rectification movement, and several years of study movement, the thought of the invincible Chairman Mao and the Party's "three red flags" have become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the whole Party and the whole people are more united, the people's communes and the worker-peasant alliance are more consolidated, and a more prosperous scene has emerged in both cities and rural areas. We believe that the great leap forward in the past two years and the current very good situation are the most inspiring, the most able to mobilize people's enthusiasm, and the most able to help people break superstitions and emancipate their minds. Now people's communist consciousness has been further improved, their minds have been further emancipated, and the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do has been further developed. Therefore, as long as the leadership puts forward goals and points out the direction in a timely manner, the technical revolution will immediately become a mass movement of the whole people with thousands of troops and horses.
	Secondly, after two years of great leap forward and technical revolution and cultural revolution movements, especially after the national industrialization, the national steelmaking, and the national electrification movements, the technical level of the vast number of workers has been greatly improved, and the experience of technical revolution is more abundant; they not only dare to think and dare to do, but also know how to think and how to do. In addition, they also have a simple materialist understanding of the laws of production and various businesses they are engaged in, and have more or less rational knowledge of mechanics, mechanics, physics, chemistry, and radio and other natural sciences... Therefore, as long as they improve their consciousness and make up their minds, they can create many things that people dare not think of.
	Third, rapidly developing production is the most urgent requirement of the broad masses, and carrying out a large-scale technical revolution has naturally become their more ardent desire, especially the rapid realization of mechanization and automation, and the complete elimination of heavy physical labor, which is something they have been dreaming of for a long time. Therefore, as long as the leadership issues a call, the broad masses will quickly take action.
	Fourth, the situation is pressing. The current actual situation is that, on the one hand, we must strive to continue the leap forward, and on the other hand, both cities and rural areas deeply feel the shortage of labor. Under such circumstances, both cadres and the broad masses deeply feel that: there is no other way but to resolutely take the road of technical revolution. At the same time, this is also a very important reason why the sharpness of this technical revolution movement initially pointed to mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation.
	Fifth, the material foundation of the two-year great leap forward is also different, and the technical equipment of various units is also different. Some units have gone from nothing to something, and some have gone from less to more, and from indigenous to foreign.
	It can be seen that the reason why this movement is so fast and the momentum is so great is not accidental, but there has been a good situation of "imminent" objectively. Therefore, this is a very good opportunity, a great opportunity that has not been seen in ten years. Our task is to recognize the situation, make a greater determination, strengthen the leadership of the movement, and develop this technical revolution movement more widely, deeply, and persistently. In this way, we can achieve greater results.
	It is worth mentioning that: with the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, at present, our city, like all parts of the country, the broad masses have launched a movement to study Chairman Mao's thought and works; launched a cultural revolution movement, and also launched a movement to vigorously develop collective welfare undertakings, comprehensively transform people's economic life, in order to gradually realize the communization movement of urban people, which will inevitably more rapidly improve people's thinking; improve people's cultural and technical level, and make our superstructure and production relations more adapted to the development of the economic base and productive forces. Thus, it will further promote the accelerated development and better and more comprehensive leap forward of the technical revolution movement and industrial and agricultural production and other construction undertakings.
	Although we have achieved the above-mentioned achievements in the previous stage of the movement, it is still far from our needs, and in many aspects we should better learn from fraternal regions and fraternal cities across the country. At the same time, we must also strive to overcome some unbalanced phenomena and other shortcomings that exist in our movement. We fully believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, as long as we can earnestly study the invincible Chairman Mao's thought and works; earnestly implement the spirit and resolutions of this representative conference, and earnestly strengthen the leadership of the movement, and solve the problems that arise in the movement in a timely manner, we will be able to achieve new and greater victories in the technical revolution movement.
	If there is anything inappropriate in my speech, please criticize and correct me.
	I wish the conference a successful victory!

专栏：

    技术革命带来了高速度
    宋洁涵代表谈长春市技术革新和技术革命的动向主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理的报告和人大常委会的报告，并在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    现在我把长春市开展技术革新和技术革命运动的情况向大会做一汇报。“四化”运动方面广速度高
    自从党的八届八中全会号召反右倾、鼓干劲，开展增产节约运动以来，全市技术革命运动就逐步地开展起来。首先从工业部门开始，在短短的时间内就很快地扩展到基本建设、交通运输、财政贸易、服务行业、文教卫生以及广大农村的各个部门。运动的发展一日千里，气势磅礴，革新果实累累，惊人的事迹不断出现。目前这一以“四化”为中心的技术革命运动正向着广泛深入和持久的方向发展着。从目前运动的发展情况来看，以下几点是应该引起我们要特别加以注意的。
    首先，运动发展非常快，有些工厂、企业一经实现机械化、自动化，生产能力就翻番。这次运动仅仅在两个月的时间内，工业系统就已经出现了三百六十八条自动化生产线，七百三十九条连续生产线和二千台自动化机床，一百一十八台联合自动机床，节省下来七百二十台设备，并有三个较大的工厂、四十个比较重要的车间由手工操作发展到机械化和自动化。现在全市工业部门机械化、半机械化程度已由年初的46.6％，提高到70％以上。在此期间，工业系统每天平均就有二十四条自动化和连续化生产线、四十七台自动化机床和一个自动化车间的出现。手工操作比重相当大的长春卷烟厂，只是在一个多月的时间就基本上实现了机械化和自动化。创造出机械化点一千二百零四项，自动化点一千四百零一项，流水生产线一百三十九条，自动生产线一百九十二条。基本建设部门在一个多月的时间内，就在木工、水暖、钢筋、混凝土等十二个工种中，创造出三千九百四十七台（件）先进机具，并搭配成二百零六套先进经验，施工效率提高了50％左右。交通运输部门在短短的一个半月时间内，也创造和改革了装卸和搬运机具二千三百三十一台（件），机械化、半机械化程度由30％提高到60％以上，在全市五千多名装卸工人中，已有三千多人摆脱了笨重的体力劳动。现在，广大农村的服务部门和加工部门（如食堂、磨米、牲畜饲料加工等），已有三分之一以上的管理区，基本上实现了机械化和半机械化。从目前技术革命运动的这种飞跃发展的速度来看，我们年初提出的全年机械化、半机械化的程度要达到75％的计划（主要指工业、基本建设和交通运输部门几个部门），显然已经落后于形势，必须加以改变。现在看来到“五一”前后，就可能达到并超过这个目标。由于机械化、半机械化，乃至自动化的程度迅速提高，这就不仅基本上解决了今年劳动力不足的问题（全市年初各单位计划今年全年需要增加八万多人，现在看来只要两万多人就可以过得去），而且有许多工厂企业的生产能力、基本建设部门的施工效率和运输部门的运输能力，也大大地提高了，甚至是成倍的增长。现在全市已有一百四十二个区属以上工厂，今年的生产能力就可以翻一番到两番以上。
    其次，从这次运动中可以看出，变手工操作为机械化、半机械化乃至自动化，并不是那样神秘、那样困难。现在看来，几乎一切有繁琐笨重的手工操作的部门都可能实现机械化、半机械化以至自动化。从工厂企业来看，实现机械化和自动化的几乎遍及所有的工种和工序。冶金工业中炼铁、炼钢、炼焦以及钢铁的原料加工，轧钢等部门，已经出现了机械化、半机械化和许多连续生产线。机械工业的铸工工种，在占用人力最多的砸铁、上料、运料、筛砂、出装窑等工序，都出现了大量的先进设备和机具。并且也完全可以做到连续化和自动化的生产。新光印刷机械厂的铸工车间全部实现了机械化和生产连续化以后，就提高了效率十五倍以上，减少作业面积近两倍，节省一半的劳动力。棉织行业正在广泛推广自动换梭和自动停经装置，人工浆纱改为机械浆纱。卷烟生产基本上实现了连续化自动化。基本建设部门的土方、挖冻土、抹灰、砌砖等都实现了机械化、半机械化。甚至长期不好解决的问题，现在也都基本上得到了解决。长春建筑三公司的职工创造了“套模拉灰砌砖器”，用它可以不拉线，不撒灰浆，每天每人可砌四、五千块砖，提高效率一倍以上，没有技术的工人也可以操作。长春建筑一公司职工创造了挖冻土机，比人工挖土提高效率七十五倍，大大的减轻了劳动强度。技术比较复杂的抹灰工种，已试制成两套效率高、质量好的机具，其效率分别超过国家定额的两倍到三倍。交通运输部门和许多工厂企业，在搬运上实现了笨重货物吊装化、成件货物输送带化、散装货物滑溜化、搬运货物车子化和轨道化。长春车站试制成功的电磁吊车，能吸吊三吨重的钢材，解决了一般吊车不易搬运钢锭、钢材的问题。铁路机务段有一台机车，已经实现了自动上煤、清灰、给油等“十五化”。
    机械化和半机械化运动，不但在生产企业里有了蓬勃的发展，而且在商品流通系统、金融部门、饮食、服务行业以及文教卫生部门也都结下了丰硕的果实。现在粮米加工、售货、售粮油、做豆腐、做豆浆、加工粉条、淘米、切菜、卷花卷、饱饺子、弹棉花、行棉衣、刷浆、洗染等方面，都相继出现了机械化、自动化。甚至放映电影、消防队出车、银行点钞票、捆钞票、澡塘子搓澡，刻字社刻字、卫生队扫街道、掏厕所等，都可以搞机械化、自动化。现在全市已有83％的粮食供应店实现了机械化、半机械化，其中有二十四个粮店实现了自动化，做到了“卖粮不用秤，卖油不用提”。长春六商店“三八”门市部卷布、量布、割布、计算、收款实现了连续化。健康旅社制出电自动开关门锁，一个人就可以管理全部（三十个）房间。南岭街清扫队制成的三轮鱼尾式扫尘机，提高效率二十六倍。由此可见，实现机械化和自动化并不是那样困难的事情，而且不只在工业部门，几乎在一切有繁琐、笨重的手工操作的地方，都可以实现机械化半机械化和自动化。
    第三，运动的发展使我们也清楚地看到：节约原材料的潜力是很大的，原材料综合利用是大有可为的。许多废物、废气、废水、废渣都将成为可资利用的好原料。现在，我市的煤气公司、胶合板工厂以及所有的粮米加工工厂等好多工厂，即将成为无废料工厂。原材料的节约、代用和综合利用，不仅在轻、化工业有极大的潜力。就是在重工业中，也是大有可为的。如在改变产品设计和改变工艺方面：汽车厂解放牌汽车，产品设计结构改变后，载重量就可由原四吨增加到五吨，车体自重还可减少半吨。度量衡厂经过改变产品设计结构后，每台衡器不仅减少了近三分之二的工序，而且减少了一半的钢铁材料。电孤炉厂将十吨电炉改变原设计结构后，每台就可由原需钢材一百零二吨减少为四十二吨，而且质量仍可达到原设计的要求。电力设计院正在研究改进火力发电站的设计。如果这一计划能够实现，今后再建一个火力发电站就可节约三千一百吨水泥，二百六十多吨钢材，减少四公里的暗管道。至于机械工业中的冷、热加工和铸件方面，节约材料的潜力也是很大的。
    第四，在大量的革新创造中，涌现出了许多重大的新技术和“高、大、精、尖、新的产品。据不完全统计，仅仅两个多月的时间全市就已经出现了四百一十二项重大
  的新技术和高、大、精、尖、新的产品。其中，工业系统三百三十二项。不仅在一些现代化的
  工厂企业，而且在其它企业和很多小的工厂也被广泛运用。长春电业局，用土办法试制遥控、遥测、遥讯装置。而这样的计划在实现之后，全市的变电所除集中由一处控制外，就都可以不用人。这样全市只需一百名电工，就可以代替过去一千一百名电工的劳动。财贸部门也采用了一些尖端技术。如秀丽粮店、孟家屯仓库等许多单位，都利用电子自动控制计量仪付粮油、付煤；长春饭店，长春五金器材批发站利用光、电创制了“自动洗手器”、“自动计数器”等。我们相信，只要使技术革命运动更为广泛深入和持久地发展下去，就将有更多的尖端技术和高、大、精、尖、新的产品出现。
    运动的发展使我们也看到：大厂大单位能够创造惊人的成就，小厂小单位也可以搞出一些奇迹来。单位不在大小，在于有没有干劲。第一汽车制造厂是现代化大企业，由于大搞技术革命运动，仅仅经过两年多的时间，基本上在不向国家要求增加投资和设备的条件下，生产能力成倍地增加。此外他们还在积极地试制汽车工业中的更新的尖端产品，并已取得了很大的成效。有一些设备简陋、技术基础很差的中小型企业，也在运动中做出了惊人的事迹。长春保温材料厂不仅在很短的时间内，就使保温砖、耐火砖的生产过程实现了机械化和自动化（过去几乎都是手工操作），大大的改善了劳动条件，降低成本，而且他们还创造出新的烧窑方法，每年可以为国家节省几万吨煤。他们的口号是“烧砖不用煤，见火不见灰，实现连续化，机械满天飞”。长春发电设备制造厂是一个电站的附属设备配制的加工厂。技术力量更为薄弱，条件更差，人们称这个厂是一无大机床、二无大厂房、三无起重机、四无大锻铸压设备的四无厂，只有三十七台精密度很差的陈旧设备。但是，他们敢于试制并制成了一万二千瓩的汽轮发电机和七十五吨的锅炉发电设备，而且质量完全合乎国家规定的标准。第五，如果说“人人都可以革新技术”这也并不是言过其实的。从这次运动来看，科学技术已经成为全民的事业。许许多多的普通劳动者闯进了科学技术的“禁宫”，这次有革新创造的不但有工程师、技术人员和研究人员，学校的老师，学生，而且有各行各业的工人。不但有技术人员，而且有许许多多刚进厂不久的青年徒工，也有几个孩子的女工、营业员、炊事员和街道的妇女……以至机关、科室的干部。最近长春机械制造厂新任命为机械铸工工程师的尤凤泰，过去一字不识，现在只有五年文化程度，他把学和创结合起来，不断改革铸造技术和工艺方法，因此就创造出一套完整的铸造砂型管理和造型等技术经验。又如进厂一年多的汽车厂发动机车间的青年徒工刘海门，在老工人帮助下，实现了五项连续化和一条自动生产线。长春化药厂女工侯桂芝是有五个孩子的妈妈，她经过一百一十三次试验，攻克了“药剂脱色”的技术堡垒。长春化学制药厂，1958年进厂的家庭妇女姜淑兰，每天要装上千个药瓶，累的腰酸腿疼，在这次运动中她决心实现机械化，不会画图，就用纸盒做模型，吃饭、走路甚至做梦都在想革新，经过多次试验，终于实现了装药膏机械化，提高效率五倍。长春机械厂板金工齐景文是个哑吧，他先后已实现六项革新项目，提高效率最少的是两倍。九台县的一个和尚也积极参加了技术革命运动，他试制成功的磨米机可提高效率三倍以上。
    第六，在技术革命运动中，厂矿之间，工厂企业和科学研究部门学校之间，地区之间，城乡之间的共产主义大协作的精神是大大地发扬了。现在，工厂企业内部各部门之间、各个工厂企业互相之间的协作已由零星的、不固定的发展到有组织有计划的全面大协作；厂内的群众运动同厂外的群众运动，同科学研究部门、大专学校的群众运动更加密切的结合了起来。形成了一个全民性的大协作运动。现在各大专学校，已有两千三百多名师生与三百二十四个单位，建立了固定的联系。正是因为这样，所以技术革命运动发展就更快，有好多过去不能生产的重要产品现在就很快地试制出来了。在这次运动中，城乡、厂社之间的协作支援也有很大的发展，全市较重要的工厂企业和专科以上学校，几乎同所有的人民公社建立了固定的联系，并从技术设备、物质以及帮助培养技术力量等方面，给农村的技术改造运动，以大力的支援。正是因为这样，所以长春地区五个县和一个近郊区在今年“五一”前后，就可全部实现农村的服务部门和后勤部门的机械化和半机械化。	技术、生产、思想、文化全面高涨
    从以上所讲的情况，就不难看出，只要我们今后能够使技术革命运动持久的发展下去，不仅会使我们当前在经济建设中，所碰到的一些带有关键性的问题能够迎刃而解，而且在整个社会主义建设事业中也必将产生重大而深远的影响。下面就讲一讲我在这方面的认识和体会。
    首先是技术革命的发展不仅能够更好的保证今年工农业生产与其他各项任务的完成，而且必将更加加速整个社会主义的建设事业的发展。因此，我们认为我国人民更为惊人的历史奇迹也许还在后头。
    从目前的情况来看，只要能够及时地提高机械化、半机械化、自动化和半自动化的水平，我们就将大大的提高生产效率，大大的节约劳动力，大大的降低成本和大量的试制高、大、精、尖、新的产品。从而就不仅能保证今年国民经济计划提前超额的完成而且由于“一厂顶几厂”、“一人顶几人”和生产能力成倍增长等局面的出现，这就有可能使今后的工农业生产和其他各项建设事业更为加速的发展。因此，针对着上述这一情况，由于全市已有区属以上的一百四十二个工厂，并将有更多的工厂的生产能力能够翻一番和翻几番的新情况的出现，所以我们考虑，过去打算在二、三年内新建或扩建的工厂，有些就可以不建或缓建，以便利用可能利用的人力、物力和财力，在全国一盘棋的方针下，用于发展薄弱环节、补充缺门以及搞尖端产品的生产。我们认为长春地区的情况是这样，全国各地的情况也将是这样。由此可见，我国工农业发展的速度以及其它各项事业的发展速度，很可能不是已经到顶了，也许更快更惊人的速度还在后头。
    其次，技术革命运动的更为广泛、深入的发展已经带来了文化革命的高涨和科学技术研究工作的加速发展。而文化革命的发展和科学技术研究工作的发展，又必将更加促进技术革命的不断高涨和经济建设的更大跃进。由于技术革命的发展，就大大的改善了劳动条件，并节约出更多的劳动力，使广大职工群众有了更为充裕的休息时间，使劳逸能更好的结合起来，从而有利于开展干部和广大群众的业余文化学习，促进文化革命的不断高涨。
    由于技术革命的深入发展，技术革新、技术革命的事迹，已经并将继续大量出现，而且已经出现了并且将继续出现很多现在书本上还没有的好东西。这样就会大大促进科学技术理论研究工作的发展，并为科学技术的理论研究工作创造了更为有利的条件。由此可见，我们国家科学技术的发展，将不是很慢而会是很快的。
    在技术革命运动中，由于广大职工与广大群众实际上都在从事于科学技术的研究工作，因而今后必将涌现出大批的、成千上万的勇于钻研，并具有相当钻研能力的人，如能对他们及时的加以培养提高，其中必将有很多的人成为我国未来的出色的科学技术专家。因此，只要坚决采取两条腿走路的方针，我们的科学技术队伍的发展也将是很快的。现在各个工厂都组织了群众性的科学技术研究小组，我们认为这是培养提高他们科学技术水平的一种很好的形式，此外，我们还打算通过召开各级的积极分子代表会，市的科学技术委员会聘请见习研究员，以及各工厂任命为工程师，特别是组织他们参加业余的和脱离生产的学习等多种形式，把他们进一步组织起来，并认真地加以培养和提高。
    三，技术革命的深入发展，在政治思想战线上也将引起更为良好的反映的。
  现在已经看得很清楚，就是那个地方技术革命运动搞得好，生产工作也就搞得好，而且人们的精神状态也就很快的变了样。从全市来看，目前这种全民性的技术革命运动是最为振奋人心，最为鼓舞人们的斗志，也是最能帮助人们解放思想的。一切真正了解情况与对现实生活尚未丧失敏感的人，都会清楚地看到：“革新成风、助人为乐”、“闹革新，已成为人们生活的一种需要”、“成为一种自觉的愉快的创造性的劳动”的这种全民性的思想和感情方面的变化以及这种变化在政治上所产生的影响（人民日报3月7日头版头条消息的标题）。因此，我们认为只要把这次运动更为广泛、深入和持久的发展下去，在政治思想方面，必将引起更为良好的反映，这样就必将更加促进社会主义建设的加速发展。	运动为什么发展得这样快  运动为什么发展这样快？
    首先是，因为在党中央和毛主席领导下，全国、吉林全省乃至长春地区都出现了十年来未有的大好形势，无论城市和农村都处在更好，更全面的跃进形势中。经过反右、整风运动，和几年的学习运动，战无不胜的毛主席的思想和党的“三面红旗”更加深入人心，全党、全民更加团结了，人民公社与工农联盟更加巩固了，无论城市和农村都出现了更为欣欣向荣的景象。我们认为：两年来的大跃进和目前这非常好的形势是最为鼓舞人心、最能调动人们积极性和最能帮助人们破除迷信与解放思想的。现在人们的共产主义觉悟更加提高了，思想更加解放了，敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格更加发扬了，因之，只要领导上及时地提出目标，指出方向，技术革命马上就会成为一个千军万马的全民性的群众运动。
    其次，经过两年大跃进和技术革命、文化革命运动，特别是经过全民办工业、全民炼钢铁、全民办电等运动，广大职工的技术水平大大提高了，技术革命的经验是更加丰富了；他们不只是敢想、敢干，而且也懂得怎样想、怎样干。加之，他们对自己所从事的生产和各种业务的规律，也有了程度不同的朴素的唯物论的理解和具有或多或少的机械学、力学、物理学、化学以及无线电等自然科学……的理性知识，因之，只要一提高自觉性，下定决心，就可能创造出许许多多人们所不敢想的事情来。
    第三，迅速的发展生产是广大群众最迫切的要求，而大搞技术革命，很自然地就成为他们更为强烈的愿望，特别是迅速实现机械化和
  自动化，彻底摆脱笨重的体力劳动，更是他们长时间梦寐以求的事情。因之，只要领导一提出号召，广大群众就会很快地行动起来。
    第四，形势逼人。目前的实际情况是：一方面我们必须争取继续跃进，另一方面无论城市和农村都深感劳动力不足，在这样的情况下，无论干部和广大群众都深深的感觉到：只有坚决走技术革命这条路，别无其他任何出路。同时，这也是为什么这次技术革命运动的锋芒一开始就指向机械化、半机械化、自动化和半自动化的一个很重要的原因。
    第五，两年的大跃进，物资基础也不一样了，各单位的技术设备也不同了，有些单位是从无到有，有的是从少到多，从土到洋。
    由此可见，这次运动所以搞得这样快，声势所以这样大，并不是偶然的，而是客观上已经存在了“一触即发”的大好形势。因此这是一个很好的时机，是十年未有过的大好时机。我们的任务就是要认清形势，下定更大的决心，加强对运动的领导，使这次技术革命运动更为广泛深入持久的发展下去。这样我们就可能取得更大的成绩。
    值得提出的是：随着技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，目前我市也和全国各地一样，广大群众又掀起了学习毛主席思想和著作的运动；掀起了文化革命运动，也掀起了以大搞集体福利事业，全面改造人民经济生活，以便逐步实现城市人民公社化运动，这样就必将更加迅速地提高人们的思想；提高人们的文化技术水平，并使我们的上层建筑和生产关系更加适应经济基础和生产力的发展。从而就会更加促进技术革命运动和工农业生产以及其它各项建设事业的加速发展与更好更全面的大跃进。
    我们在前一段的运动中虽然取得了上述的成绩，但是，离我们的需要还相差很远，而在许多方面我们还应更好地向全国各兄弟地区和兄弟城市来学习。同时还要努力克服我们在运动中存在的某些不平衡的现象和其他方面的缺点。我们完全相信，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，只要我们能够认真学习战无不胜的毛主席思想和著作；认真地贯彻这次代表大会的精神和决议，并切实加强对运动的领导，及时解决运动中所出现的问题，我们就能够在技术革命运动中取得新的更大的胜利。
    我的发言如有不妥之处，请代表们批评指正。
    祝大会胜利成功！
