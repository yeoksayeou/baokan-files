Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 23rd: China's first self-designed, self-built 10,000-ton ocean-going freighter – the "Dongfeng" (East Wind) – was recently launched at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai.

This freighter has a cargo capacity of 10,000 tons and an endurance of 12,000 nautical miles. If starting from Shanghai, it can reach Leningrad in the Soviet Union via the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans without refueling or replenishing supplies.

The "Dongfeng" 10,000-ton ocean-going freighter took only 88 days from material input to launch, 11 days ahead of schedule, with a dockyard construction period of only 49 days. In 1957, the "Seifu Maru" ocean-going freighter, built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Japan with a deadweight of 10,500 tons, took four months and nine days from material input to launch.

The "Dongfeng" has a cargo capacity of 10,000 tons, a displacement of over 16,000 tons, a speed of 17 knots per hour, and an endurance of 12,000 nautical miles. Once completed, this freighter can sail from Shanghai, traverse the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, and reach Leningrad in the Soviet Union without refueling or replenishing supplies.

The fact that such a modern giant ship could be built in a dockyard construction period of only 49 days is the result of the shipyard's workers vigorously engaging in the technological revolution. Entering the 1960s, all the workers in the factory had even greater ambitions and higher aspirations. They boldly proposed: "The East Wind is blowing stronger and stronger, shipbuilding must be better and better, and faster and faster." A vigorous technological revolution swept the entire factory. From material input to launch, the 10,000-ton ocean-going freighter saw the implementation of more than 300 major technological innovation projects, and more than 180 design and process improvements. A variety of new processes and technologies were adopted, which shortened the dockyard construction period repeatedly. The qualified rate of the main structural welds of the entire ship reached more than 98%, and the construction cost of the hull was reduced by 5.5%.

In the construction process, the workers developed a daring and proactive communist spirit, and many things that were originally considered "impossible" were accomplished. When the freighter began construction, all the materials and equipment on board could be manufactured domestically, except for one precision instrument - the gyrocompass, which could not yet be manufactured at that time. Upon learning of this, the workers in the electrical workshop resolutely stated: "The 'Dongfeng' must use a domestically produced gyrocompass." Workers Li Wenmin, engineer Ma Tengtu, and others, overcame numerous difficulties and finally produced China's first gyrocompass. Old worker Wu Yuqi, as early as before the launch of the 10,000-ton ship, was already thinking about how to avoid heavy manual labor during the launch. He pondered day and night and finally created an advanced "silent launch" operation method.

In 1958, this factory built its first 5,000-ton freighter, the "Heping (Peace) No. 28," with a dockyard construction period of only 70 days; in 1959, it built its second 5,000-ton freighter, the "Heping No. 18," and the dockyard construction period was shortened to 35 days. This time, although the 10,000-ton giant ship has twice the cargo capacity, the dockyard construction period was only 49 days. (Attached picture)

### 我国第一艘远洋货轮下水

    我国第一艘远洋货轮下水
    这艘货轮载货量一万吨，续航力一万二千浬，如果从上海起碇，经太平洋、印度洋、大西洋，可直达苏联列宁格勒中途不必添加燃料、饮料
    新华社上海23日电　我国自行设计、自行建造的第一艘万吨级远洋货轮——“东风号”，最近在上海江南造船厂下水。
    “东风号”万吨级远洋货轮，从投料到下水，只用了八十八天时间，比原定计划提前十一天，其中船台周期只用了四十九天时间。1957年，日本川崎重工业株式会社造的载重一万零五百吨的“西风号”远洋货轮，从投料到下水花了四个月零九天时间。
    “东风号”载货量一万吨，排水量一万六千多吨，航速每小时十七浬，续航力一万二千浬，这艘货轮建成后如从上海起碇，沿太平洋，经印度洋、大西洋，中途不加燃料、饮料，可直达苏联列宁格勒。
    这样一艘现代化巨轮的建造，船台周期只用了四十九天时间，是这个厂职工群众大闹技术革命的结果。全厂职工一跨进六十年代，雄心更大，志向更高。他们豪迈地提出：东风越吹越猛，造船要越造越好，越造越快。全厂掀起了轰轰烈烈的技术革命高潮。万吨级远洋货轮从投料到下水，共实现了三百多项重大的技术革新项目，改进设计、改进工艺达一百八十多项，采用了多种新工艺、新技术，使船台周期一再缩短。全船主要结构焊缝合格率达98％以上，船壳建造成本降低了5.5％。
    在建造过程中，工人们发扬了敢想、敢做的共产主义风格，许多原来认为“办不到”的事情办到了。货轮开始建造时，船上所有的材料、设备都能在国内制造，独有一台精密仪器——电罗经当时还不能制造。电气车间工人知道这件事以后，坚决表示：“东风号”一定要用上国产电罗经。工人李文敏、工程师马腾图等，战胜了重重困难，终于制成了我国第一台电罗经。老工人吴裕其，早在万吨轮船下水以前，就想到如何在下水时不再进行笨重体力劳动。他日夜苦想，终于创造了“无声下水”的先进操作法。
    这个厂在1958年建造第一艘五千吨海轮——“和平二十八号”，船台周期只用了七十天；1959年，建造第二艘五千吨海轮“和平十八号”，船台周期缩短到三十五天。这次的万吨巨轮，虽然载货量大一倍，而船台周期只用了四十九天。（附图片）
