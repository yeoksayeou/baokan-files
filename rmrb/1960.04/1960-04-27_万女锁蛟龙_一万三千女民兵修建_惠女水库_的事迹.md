    Ten Thousand Women Lock the Dragon
    The Deeds of 13,000 Female Militiamen Building the "Hui Women's Reservoir"

    In the Daluo Mountains of Jinjiang, Fujian, along both banks of the Luo River, a series of connected camps stretching for dozens of miles have been established. At night, lamps shine brightly, and fires illuminate the sky. During the day, as far as the eye can see within a radius of tens of miles, there are crowds of people working, making this remote mountain area a scene of bustling activity. Here, a female militia division of more than 13,000 people, after a year and eight months of arduous struggle, has built a "Hui Women's Reservoir."

    This reservoir is so big! Its dam is thirty meters higher than the nationally famous Ming Tombs Reservoir, and its storage capacity is more than 40 million cubic meters greater than the Ming Tombs Reservoir. The reservoir's left and right main canals stretch for four hundred miles from Jinjiang County to the hinterland of Hui'an, irrigating seven-fifths of Hui'an's dry land. This is a monument established by the female militia of Hui'an under the brilliant light of the General Line, with soaring drive.

    The reservoir is built in Wutan, Daluo Mountain. The water of Wutan is dark green and bottomless, so it was originally named "Wutan Reservoir." Last year, Comrade Chen Boda, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, came to inspect the construction site and suggested renaming it "Hui Women's Reservoir," and personally inscribed the words: "Long live the heroic women of Hui'an!"

    In June 1958, when the Hui'an County Party Committee proposed building a reservoir in a neighboring county, the women were the first to express their warm support. The mountains of Hui'an are barren, and the land of Hui'an is arid. The women dig wells every year, digging a foot, no water; digging ten feet, still no water. Even when deep wells are dug and water is found, the well water is still not enough for the thirsty land. The women have long hoped for a clear spring, a stream flowing to the fields. Now, upon hearing about building a reservoir in another county, more than 13,000 women signed up and formed an army of women to build the reservoir. Carrying their luggage, holding their hoes, carrying their iron shovels, and carrying their manure baskets, they traveled a hundred miles to Luo River in a mighty procession.

    In November of that year, more than 13,000 women from Hui'an, responding to Chairman Mao's call to vigorously establish militia divisions, formed a female militia division on the construction site. From then on, they completed their labor tasks organized by battalion, company, platoon, and squad. Ten thousand women were even more united, and ten thousand women were twisted into an even tighter rope. Whenever there was a difficult task, the women battalion commanders, company commanders, and platoon leaders would lead their female militiamen to charge forward. When the east turned white in the morning, at the sound of the bugle, the female militiamen would line up and march onto the construction site with neat steps. At noon, on the river beach and in the shade of the trees, there appeared rows and rows, and companies and companies of female militiamen conducting drills. They used their hands that embroidered dragons and phoenixes to hold rifles; they used their crisp voices to shout commands. When the sun set in the west, the female militiamen's basketball team launched a fierce battle on the mountain waist court. From the thatched sheds of the cultural night school, came the sound of朗朗读书声. The sisters of the dance troupe and song troupe enthusiastically rehearsed new dance programs, singing their newly composed songs.

    Less than four months after the establishment of the female militia division, it was subjected to a severe test. In February 1959, it rained heavily along the coast for more than ten days. Mountain torrents broke out, and the water of Wutan suddenly became like a ferocious dragon, roaring and tumbling, impacting the twenty-meter-high temporary cofferdam. If it were allowed to break through, the dam, which had only been built to a height of ten meters, would be washed away; the flood would also flow for thousands of miles, submerging the villages downstream. As the saying goes: Soldiers come to block, earth comes to contain the water. At this time, the female militia division stood on the cofferdam in the heavy rain. Company after company, battalion after battalion, raised the top of the dam; row after row, squad after squad, deeply dug the spillway. The rain poured down, and lightning flashed. The women who carried soil to the dam usually carried two baskets at a time, but now they carried four or six baskets at a time. Many people fell in the mud and water and got up again, continuing to fight. "If the flood is not subdued, we will never withdraw our troops!" In this way, they fought for three days and three nights, and as the flood rose an inch, the top of the dam rose a foot.

    The dam rose higher every moment. The women's army worked even harder, and they became even more ingenious. Yang Ashang, the female militia platoon leader, and the platoon she led, developed a collective relay soil transportation method. Every eleven people used eight carts. Two people pushed uphill, and one person slid downhill, which was both fast and easy. The female boatmen transporting stones on the Luo River, since the female militia Zhang Zhaozhi used the towing method, everyone shook one boat, dragging three boats behind them. On the Luo River, only long dragon-like fleets were seen, but few boatmen wearing bamboo hats were seen. Although at this time there were many inventions and creations for ramming, pushing soil, chiseling stones, etc., they were still not satisfied. Because at this time the province, the special zone, and the county added bulldozers, tractors, and transport vehicles to the construction site, each militia company and platoon proposed to compete with these machines: to make the soil mechanical, to catch up with foreign machinery! ...

    In February of this year, when the Hui Women's Reservoir was completed, this women's army planted flags all over the dam to celebrate the great victory of women's labor. Among the more than 13,000 women of Hui'an, militia platoon leader Yang Ashang and female militiamen Xin Li, Xu Pei, Zhang Zhaozhi and more than 3,000 others made meritorious contributions. Today, Yang Ashang, representing the militia division of the reservoir construction site, came to Beijing to report: Ten thousand women built a reservoir, and ten thousand women locked the dragon!

    万女锁蛟龙
    一万三千女民兵修建“惠女水库”的事迹
    新华社记者　周长宗
    在福建晋江大罗山，沿着罗溪两岸，扎下了绵亘数十里的连营寨。夜间，这里灯盏通明，火光烛天。白天极目四望，方圆几十里内，到处是劳动着的人群，使得这深山僻野，一片沸腾。在这里，一万三千多人的女民兵师，经过一年零八个月的苦战，修起了一座“惠女水库”。
    这水库好大！它的大坝比全国著名的十三陵水库还高三十米，蓄水量也比十三陵水库多四千多万公方，水库左右两条大干渠，从晋江县曲曲折折伸到惠安腹地，长达四百里，可以灌溉惠安七分之五的旱地。这是惠安女民兵在总路线光辉照耀下，以冲天干劲，建立的一座丰碑。
    水库建在大罗山乌潭。乌潭水一片墨绿，深不见底，因此从前起的名字叫“乌潭水库”。去年中共中央政治局候补委员陈伯达同志来工地视察，提议将它改名为“惠女水库”，并亲笔题了辞：“英勇的惠安妇女万岁！”
    1958年6月，惠安县委一提出在邻县修水库，妇女们首先表示热烈拥护。惠安的山，是秃山；惠安的土地是旱地。妇女们年年都打井，打一尺，不见水；挖一丈，还是不见水。等到深井挖出水来，井水还是不够旱龙喝。妇女们老早盼望有清泉，一股清流到田间。现在一说到外县修水库，一万三千多妇女报了名，编成修水库的娘子军。她们背着行李，拿着镐头，扛着铁铣，带着粪箕，远行百里，浩浩荡荡来到罗溪。
    在这一年11月，一万三千多名惠安妇女，响应毛主席大办民兵师的号召，在工地上编成了女民兵师。从此后，她们以营、连、排、班组织去完成劳动任务，万女更加一条心，万女更紧地拧成绳。一旦有艰巨任务，那些妇女营长、连长、排长，便带领着她们的女民兵上前打冲锋。当早晨东方发白的时候，军号一声响，女民兵便排成队伍，迈着整齐的步伐走上工地。一到中午，在河滩上，在林阴里，出现了一排排、一连连进行操练的女民兵。她们用那描龙绣凤的手，端起了步枪；用那清脆的嗓子，喊着口令。一到夕阳西下，女民兵的篮球队，就在山腰球场上展开了激烈的争夺战。从文化夜校的茅棚里，传出朗朗读书声。舞蹈队和歌咏队的姐妹们，起劲地排练着新的舞蹈节目，唱着自己新编的歌曲。
    女民兵师成立不到四个月，就接受了一场严重考验。1959年2月间，沿海连着下了十几天大雨。山洪暴发了，乌潭的水突然变得像一条凶恶的蛟龙，咆哮翻滚，冲击着二十米高的临时围水坝。如果让它冲出来，才修了十米高的大坝就要被冲垮；洪水也将一泻千里，淹没下游的村庄。常言说：兵来将挡，水来土屯。这时候，女民兵师在大雨中站上了围水坝。一连连、一营营，加高着坝顶；一排排、一班班，深挖着溢洪道。雨如瓢泼，雷电闪光。往坝上挑土的妇女，平素一次挑两筐，现在一次挑四筐、挑六筐。多少人在泥水中跌倒又爬起，继续战斗。“洪水不驯服，我们决不撤兵！”就这样，她们战斗了三天三夜，洪水长一寸，坝顶就高一尺。
    大坝每时每刻往上高。娘子军干得更起劲，干得也更加心灵手巧。女民兵排长杨阿赏，带领的那个排，研究出一种集体接力运土法，每十一个人用八部车子，上坡是双人推，下坡是一人滑，又快当，又轻便。在罗溪河上运石的女船工，自从女民兵张招治用了拖船法以后，大家也都每人摇一只船，后边拖三只船，罗溪河上也就只见长龙般的船队，却很少见到头戴竹笠的艄公了。尽管这时候打夯的、推土的、凿石的等等，都有了许多发明创造，她们仍然不满足。由于这时省里、专区和县里，给工地增添了推土机、拖拉机和运输汽车，各个民兵连、排竟提出要跟这些机械竞赛：要使土机械，赶上洋机械！………
    今年2月，当惠女水库完工的时候，这支娘子军在大坝上插遍旌旗，庆祝了妇女劳动的伟大胜利。在一万三千多惠安妇女中，民兵排长杨阿赏和女民兵辛娌、许配、张招治等三千多人立了功。今天，杨阿赏代表水库工地民兵师，来到北京汇报：万女修起了水库，万女锁住了蛟龙！
