    South Korean People Roar!
    A storm of struggle against the fascist rule of the Syngman Rhee clique is sweeping through South Korea. Since the people of Masan held demonstrations on March 15 to protest the "election" farce directed by Syngman Rhee, especially after more than 20,000 people in Masan held a large-scale demonstration on April 11, the flames of the people's struggle have spread to Seoul, Busan, Cheongju, Gwangju, Daegu, Incheon, Jinju, Ulsan and other places. The people in various parts of South Korea, regardless of the bloody suppression by the Syngman Rhee clique, have fought wave upon wave, one after another. Tens of thousands of people have participated in the demonstrations, and they have persisted in their struggle for dozens of days. The flames of the struggle of the masses in Seoul have been burning to the location of the Syngman Rhee clique's puppet government. They tore up documents from the puppet government's central office, forced their way into Syngman Rhee's residence, and burned down the headquarters of Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party, the headquarters of the "Anti-Communist Youth League of Greater Korea," and the "Anti-Communist Hall," the strongholds of counter-revolutionary forces. They also roared to smash the statue of MacArthur, the head of the US military invading Korea. This large-scale struggle of the South Korean people has severely hit the reactionary rule of the Syngman Rhee clique. Even the US propaganda machine cannot but admit that the Syngman Rhee clique is facing "the most serious crisis in its twelve years of rule."
    The current struggle of the South Korean people began with a protest against the Syngman Rhee clique's "presidential election." However, the "election" was only the fuse that triggered this struggle. This struggle is the eruption of long-accumulated anger among the South Korean people who have been enslaved by the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee clique for fifteen years. The American propaganda machine also admits that "the roots of this riot are obviously much deeper" because "the lives of most residents in South Korea are extremely poor, and many South Koreans have no hope for the future." For more than a decade, under the fascist rule of the Syngman Rhee traitorous group, the beautiful land of South Korea has become an extremely dark and brutal hell on earth. South Korea's socio-economy is riddled with holes, all industries are withered, the people have no way to make a living, cities are full of millions of unemployed people, and in rural areas, as many as three to four million farmers lack food each year. The Syngman Rhee clique has not only deprived the South Korean people of all basic democratic freedoms and rights to life, but has also turned South Korea into a large "concentration camp" through bloody massacres. In the past year alone, 270,000 people were imprisoned and slaughtered by the Syngman Rhee clique! It is unimaginable that the South Korean people would willingly endure this inhuman life. It is inevitable that they will rise up and fight for their right to survive. Millions of South Korean people have shouted the slogans "Syngman Rhee regime, step down!" and "Down with the dictatorial government!" This is their battle cry, and it is also the death knell for the Syngman Rhee clique's criminal rule.
  The flames of the South Korean people's struggle against the Syngman Rhee clique have greatly shocked the United States. In a statement on April 19, the US State Department hypocritically called on the Syngman Rhee clique to take so-called "necessary and effective actions to protect democratic rights such as freedom of speech, assembly, and publication, and to maintain secret voting." US Secretary of State Herter also came out to "condemn" the Syngman Rhee clique for taking "repressive measures inconsistent with a free democratic country." US imperialism wants to create the impression that the disasters brought to the South Korean people by the Syngman Rhee clique's reactionary rule are unrelated to the United States, and even disapproved of by the United States. However, this approach by the United States is as absurd as a crab blaming its son for walking sideways. Who doesn't know that the Syngman Rhee clique is fundamentally a puppet regime manufactured and imposed on the South Korean people by US imperialism for the needs of its aggression against Korea. Without the support of American bayonets, the Syngman Rhee clique's rule would not last a day. In order to split Korea and turn South Korea into its colony and atomic war base, the American aggressors, through the fascist rule of the Syngman Rhee clique, turned the South Korean people into slaves to be slaughtered at will. The deep suffering of the South Korean people does not come from anywhere else, but from the US imperialist policy of aggression against South Korea. As long as the American aggressors do not leave South Korea, the deep suffering of the South Korean people will not end. The broad masses of the South Korean people have increasingly realized this from their personal experiences. The pretense of the American aggressors is only because they are afraid that the flames of the South Korean people's struggle will burn them.
    However, the American aggressors are so self-contradictory. While pretending to be good people, they also announced their continued support for the Syngman Rhee clique. The US "Ambassador" to South Korea demanded that the demonstrators "immediately restore" the Syngman Rhee clique's "law and order." The US State Department said in a statement that the United States is the Syngman Rhee clique's "closest friend, supporter, and ally." Not only that, but the United States is also stepping up its assistance and urging Syngman Rhee to suppress the South Korean people's struggle. While the South Korean people's struggle is in full swing, the United States openly announced that it would launch "Honest John" missiles at the base of the 20th Artillery Regiment of the US First Cavalry Division in South Korea on April 19 to intimidate the South Korean people. According to US news agencies, the 15th Division of the Syngman Rhee clique, which bloodily suppressed the demonstrators in Seoul, was specially sent back to Seoul from the ceasefire line by the US military command in Korea. US Secretary of Defense Gates revealed that the United States is studying increasing US troops stationed in Korea to help Syngman Rhee carry out suppression and strengthen control over the South Korean puppet army. All these facts fully demonstrate that it is none other than US imperialism that is the most ferocious enemy of the South Korean people.
    On April 21, the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea issued a letter to the South Korean people, calling on all Korean patriotic forces to unite in order to withdraw the US aggressor troops and overthrow the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, and proposed to urgently convene a joint meeting of representatives of political parties and social organizations from North and South Korea to discuss countermeasures for dealing with the current serious situation in South Korea. Obviously, this call and proposal are voices from the hearts of all Korean patriots, pointing out the correct path for the South Korean people's struggle. Drive out the American aggressor troops, end the traitorous fascist rule in South Korea, let the Korean people solve their own problems, and realize the peaceful reunification of Korea. This is the only way for the South Korean people to get rid of their current disastrous fate. At the same time, this is also the common aspiration and common struggle goal of all the Korean people.
    The Chinese people fully support the proposals and propositions put forward by the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea in its letter to the South Korean people. We deeply sympathize with the disasters suffered by the South Korean people and resolutely support their just struggle against the fascist rule of the Syngman Rhee clique. Our people have always maintained that the US aggressor troops must get out of South Korea and let the Korean people solve their own problems. We have always believed that the US policy of invading South Korea, enslaving South Korea, splitting the Korean nation, and obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea is absolutely unworkable. The South Korean people will never succumb. Sooner or later, they will realize their national aspirations to overthrow the Syngman Rhee puppet regime and drive out the American aggressors.
    At present, the Syngman Rhee clique's situation has become extremely isolated. Under the direction of the United States, it is playing tricks such as so-called "collective resignation" and "constitutional amendment" in an attempt to ease the struggle of the South Korean people, so as to continue to maintain US imperialism's aggression and enslavement of South Korea by changing the soup but not the medicine. This conspiracy is worth vigilance. However, in any case, as long as the American aggressor troops do not withdraw, the American puppet regime is not overthrown, and the American interference in Korea does not stop, then the flames of the Korean people's struggle will not be extinguished for a day, and their struggle will not end for a day, but will only become stronger and stronger. Sooner or later, the American aggressors and their puppet little court in South Korea will be burned to ashes in the flames of the Korean people!

### 南朝鲜人民怒吼了

    南朝鲜人民怒吼了
    一场反对李承晚集团法西斯统治的斗争风暴，正在席卷南朝鲜。自从3月15日马山市人民为抗议李承晚导演的“选举”丑剧而举行示威，特别是4月11日马山市两万多人民举行大示威以后，人民斗争的烈火已经燃遍汉城、釜山、清州、光州、大丘、仁川、晋州、蔚山等地。南朝鲜各地人民不顾李承晚集团的血腥镇压，前仆后继，此伏彼起。参加示威的群众数以万计，而且已经坚持斗争数十天之久。汉城群众斗争的烈火一直烧到李承晚集团伪政府所在地。他们撕毁了伪政府中央厅办公室的文件，逼进了李承晚的住所，烧毁了李承晚自由党总部、“大韩反共青年会”总部“反共会馆”等反革命势力的大本营。他们还怒不可遏地要砸毁侵朝美军头子麦克阿瑟的铜像。南朝鲜人民这一规模浩大的斗争，严重打击了李承晚集团的反动统治。甚至美国的宣传机器也不能不承认李承晚集团面临“执政十二年历史上最严重的危机。”
    南朝鲜人民的这次斗争是从抗议李承晚集团的“总统选举”开始的。然而，“选举”不过是引发这次斗争的导火线。这次斗争是十五年来在美国侵略者和李承晚集团奴役下的南朝鲜人民久已蕴积的怒火的爆发。美国的宣传机器也承认：“这次暴动的根源显然要深刻得多”，因为南朝鲜“大多数居民的生活贫穷不堪，许多南朝鲜人对未来一无希望”。十几年来在李承晚卖国集团的法西斯统治下，南朝鲜的大好河山已经变成一座绝顶黑暗和残暴的人间地狱。南朝鲜的社会经济千疮百孔，百业雕蔽，人民无谋生之路，城市里到处是千千万万的失业人群，农村里仅断粮的农民一年就达三、四百万之多。李承晚集团不仅剥夺了南朝鲜人民的一切起码的民主自由和生活权利，而且以血腥屠杀的手段把南朝鲜变成了一座大“集中营”。仅去年一年被李承晚集团监禁和屠杀的人民就达二十七万人！人们不能想像，南朝鲜人民会甘心忍受这种非人的生活，他们起来为自己的生存权利而斗争，这是不可避免的。千百万南朝鲜人民喊出了“李承晚政权滚下台”、“打倒独裁政府”的呼声，这是他们的斗争号角，也是李承晚集团的罪恶统治的丧钟。
  南朝鲜人民反对李承晚集团的斗争烈火使美国大为震惊。美国国务院在4月19日的声明中假惺惺地要李承晚集团采取所谓“必要的和有效的行动以保护言论、集会、出版自由等民主权利，并维护秘密投票”。美国国务卿赫脱还出来“指责”李承晚集团采取同一个“自由民主国家不相称的镇压性措施”。美帝国主义想要造成一种印象，似乎李承晚集
  团反动统治给南朝鲜人民带来的灾难，是同美国无关的，甚至是美国所不赞成的。然而，美国这种做法就好像螃蟹责备它的儿子横行一样的荒唐。谁不知道，李承晚集团压根儿就是美帝国主义为了侵略朝鲜的需要而一手制造出来、强加在南朝鲜人民身上的傀儡政权。没有美国刺刀的扶植，李承晚集团的统治是一天也维持不下去的。美国侵略者为了分裂朝鲜、把南朝鲜变成它的殖民地和原子战争基地，通过李承晚集团的法西斯统治，把南朝鲜人民变成它任意宰割的奴隶。南朝鲜人民的深重灾难，不是来自别的地方，而是来自美帝国主义对南朝鲜的侵略政策。美国侵略者一天不离开南朝鲜，南朝鲜人民的深重灾难就一天不会结束。广大南朝鲜人民从他们切身体验中，已经越来越看清楚了这一点。美国侵略者的装模作样，只不过是因为它害怕南朝鲜人民的斗争火焰烧到自己身上来罢了。
    可是，美国侵略者竟是这样自相矛盾，它一边要假装好人，一边却又宣布继续支持李承晚集团。美国驻南朝鲜“大使”要求示威者“立即恢复”李承晚集团的“法律和秩序”。美国国务院在声明中说美国是李承晚集团“最密切的朋友、支持者和盟友”。不仅如此，美国还加紧帮助和督促李承晚镇压南朝鲜人民的斗争。在南朝鲜人民斗争方酣的时候，美国公开宣布要在4月19日在南朝鲜的美国第一骑兵师第二十炮兵团基地发射“诚实的约翰”导弹，以恐吓南朝鲜人民。据美国通讯社报道，血腥镇压汉城示威者的李承晚集团的第十五师团，就是由侵朝美军司令部特地从停战线派回汉城的。美国国防部长盖茨透露，美国正在研究增加美国侵朝部队，以帮助李承晚进行镇压和加强对李伪军的控制。这一切事实充分说明，不是别人，正是美帝国主义是南朝鲜人民的最凶恶的敌人。
    4月21日，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会发表了告南朝鲜人民书，号召一切朝鲜爱国力量，为了使美国侵略军撤走，为了打倒李承晚傀儡政权，团结起来，并建议紧急召集南北朝鲜各党派、社会团体代表联席会议，讨论处理南朝鲜目前严重局势的对策。很明显，这个号召和建议，是从朝鲜一切爱国者的心里发出的声音，给南朝鲜人民的斗争指出了正确的道路。赶走美国侵略军，结束南朝鲜的卖国的法西斯统治，由朝鲜人民自己解决自己的问题，实现朝鲜的和平统一，这就是南朝鲜人民摆脱目前灾难的命运的唯一出路，同时，这也是全体朝鲜人民的共同愿望和共同斗争的目标。
    中国人民完全支持朝鲜劳动党中央委员会在告南朝鲜人民书中所提出的建议和主张。我们深切地同情南朝鲜人民受到的灾难，坚决支持他们反对李承晚集团法西斯统治的正义斗争。我国人民一贯主张美国侵略军必须滚出南朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自己解决自己的问题。我们一直认为，美国侵略南朝鲜，奴役南朝鲜，分裂朝鲜民族，阻挠朝鲜和平统一的罪恶政策是绝对行不通的。南朝鲜人民是绝对不会屈服的，他们迟早要实现他们推翻李承晚傀儡政权、赶走美国侵略者的民族愿望。
    目前，李承晚集团的处境已经极端孤立。在美国的指使下，它正玩弄所谓“集体辞职”和“修改宪法”等等花招，企图和缓南朝鲜人民的斗争，以便用换汤不换药的办法，继续维持美帝国主义对南朝鲜的侵略和奴役。这个阴谋是值得警惕的。但是，无论如何，只要美国侵略军一天不撤走，美国的傀儡政权一天不打倒，美国对朝鲜的干涉一天不停止，那么朝鲜人民的斗争烈火就一天不会熄灭，他们的斗争就一天不会结束，而只会越来越强烈，越来越壮大，总有一天，美国侵略者和它在南朝鲜的傀儡小朝廷必将在朝鲜人民的烈火中烧得一干二净！
