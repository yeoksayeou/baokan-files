Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 25th - Nine hundred and forty-eight overseas Chinese who suffered from a fire in Bangka, West Kalimantan, Indonesia, left Singkawang on the "Fu Ying" ship on the evening of the 23rd to return to China. Thus, among the more than four thousand overseas Chinese who suffered from the fire in Bangka, two thousand nine hundred people and some poor overseas Chinese from West Kalimantan have successively returned to China on three batches of ships sent by the motherland.

Consul Mao Xinyu of the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta remains in Singkawang to handle the affairs of the fire-stricken overseas Chinese returning to China.

The "Da Bao Kang" ship sent by the Chinese government arrived in Selat Panjang, Riau Province, yesterday morning and will transport the overseas Chinese who suffered from another fire there back to China. A major fire occurred in Selat Panjang on February 14, affecting more than eight thousand overseas Chinese.

Consul Liu Qingyou of the Chinese Consulate in Medan traveled to Selat Panjang again a few days ago to handle matters related to the return to China of overseas Chinese who suffered from the fire and overseas Chinese who lost their livelihoods due to the prohibition of foreign nationals from engaging in retail trade.
