    Unforgettable Impressions
    Lin Rong, Deputy Director of the Biological Sciences Division of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

    Today, as we celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of Hungary's liberation with boundless excitement, I recall a pleasant experience in the beautiful land of Hungary around this time last year. We visited Eger and other famous cities, and toured several agricultural cooperatives. The achievements of the hardworking and brave Hungarian people in socialist construction are commendable. Whether in the city or the countryside, wherever we went, our hospitable hosts always welcomed us with great enthusiasm. In the heroic capital, Budapest, we were honored to participate in the grand military parade and colorful mass parade on Liberation Day, which left a deep impression on us.
    In Budapest and other cities, we met many outstanding Hungarian scientists who are working tirelessly and making significant contributions to the prosperity of their country and the progress of mankind. In the field of biology, some scientific institutions have a history of more than a hundred years, such as the National Museum established in 1802, which houses a rich collection of specimens and books. Many research institutes were established under the rule of the working class and have developed rapidly in a short period. The institutes I visited, such as the Institute of Biochemistry in the field of proteins and enzymes, and the Institute of Genetics in the field of genetic variation of microorganisms, have all carried out very meaningful work. The Biological Research Institute, located in the beautiful scenery of Lake Balaton, has had outstanding achievements in aquatic biology and experimental biology for many years.
    Hungarian botany has a glorious tradition. A large number of specimens collected by Kitaibel, known as the father of Hungarian botany, from 1790 to 1812 have been preserved. After more than a hundred years, the content of botanical research has become richer. Recently, geobotanists have conducted comprehensive and in-depth research on Hungary's vast grasslands and lush forests, playing a significant guiding role in national economic construction. Academician-Correspondent Soó Rezső, Director of the Institute of Botany of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, spared no effort to accompany me to observe forests in some typical locations, and put forward his own correct views on the vegetation of Central Europe. He visited our country not long ago. Thanks to his continuous efforts, scientific cooperation between China and Hungary has taken a big step forward.
    Our visit to Hungary last year for more than ten days was very rewarding. Not only did we deeply feel the profound friendship of the Hungarian people towards the Chinese people, but we also further recognized their strong will in socialist construction and their high level in various aspects of science and technology. We attach great importance to scientific cooperation between China and Hungary, because it marks the common aspiration of the people and scientists of the two countries, and is also an important way to promote the great unity of the socialist camp.

    难忘的印象
    中国科学院生物学部副主任　林镕
    今天，在我们怀着无比兴奋心情庆祝匈牙利解放十五周年的时候，我回忆到去年这时候在匈牙利美丽国土上的一段愉快的经历。我们访问了爱格尔和其他著名的城市，参观了几个农业合作社。勤劳勇敢的匈牙利人民在社会主义建设中的成就是值得称颂的。在城市或乡村，无论我们走到哪里，好客的主人们，总是热情洋溢地款待我们。在英雄的首都——布达佩斯，我们荣幸地参加了解放日的盛大的阅兵典礼和丰富多彩的群众游行，给我们留下了深刻的印象。
    在布达佩斯和其他城市，我们认识了不少匈牙利优秀的科学家，他们为祖国的繁荣和人类的进步不懈地劳动着，并作出重大的贡献。从生物学的领域来说，一些科学机构有百年以上的历史，如1802年建立的国家博物馆，收藏着丰富的标本和图书。许多研究所在工人阶级的政权下建立起来，并在短期中得到快速的发展。我到过的研究所，如生物化学研究所在蛋白质和酶方面，遗传研究所在微生物的遗传变异方面，都进行了极有意义的工作。在巴拉顿湖美丽的风光中的生物研究所，多年来在水生生物学和实验生物学方面都有杰出的成就。
    匈牙利的植物学有光荣的传统，号称匈牙利植物学之父的基泰拜尔在1790到1812年采集的大量标本都保存下来。经过一百多年，植物学研究工作的内容更丰富了。最近期间，地植物学家对匈牙利广阔的草原和繁茂的森林作了全面而深入的研究，在国民经济建设上起着很大的指导作用。匈牙利科学院植物研究所所长索约米通讯院士不辞辛苦，陪伴我观察了一些典型地点的森林，提出了他自己关于中欧植被的正确观点。他不久以前曾来我国访问。由于他不断的努力，使中匈两国的科学合作迈进了一大步。
    我们去年在匈牙利十几天的访问有很大的收获，不但深切体会到匈牙利人民对中国人民的深厚友谊，还进一步认识到他们在社会主义建设中的坚强意志和在科学技术各方面的高度水平。我们十分重视中匈两国的科学合作，因为这标志着两国人民和科学家的共同愿望，也是促进社会主义阵营大团结的一个重要的途径。
