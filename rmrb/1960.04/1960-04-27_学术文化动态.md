New Insights into Free Radical Carcinogenesis

On February 27th, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, N.M. Emanuel, gave a lecture at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences on the problems of cancer from a physical chemistry point of view and the new principles of cancer chemotherapy. He said that the action of free radicals of organic compounds on tissues may cause cancer. Therefore, the application of inhibitors of free radical processes may treat cancer.

Free radicals are substances that exist when a bond in an organic compound breaks but has not yet recombined. Thermal decomposition of ethyl lead will produce free ethyl. Proteins and nucleic acids will also produce free radicals when subjected to physical factors (such as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation). Radiation acting on the body will first cause the production of free radicals in the body. At the same time, it has long been known that radiation can cause animals to develop radiation sickness or leukemia. Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan, suffered from atomic bomb explosions and have a high percentage of residents suffering from leukemia compared to other cities. Residents in the south are prone to skin cancer due to strong sunlight exposure. This shows that free radicals produced under the action of light and radiation can cause cancer. In addition, irradiating enzymes containing flavin cofactors with sunlight will produce free radicals. Radiation can cause the production of free radicals in biological substances. Many known carcinogens (automobile exhaust, tobacco tar, and coal tar, etc.) either contain free radicals themselves or easily produce free radicals. This also shows that the action of free radicals can transform normal cells into cancer cells.

Regarding the mechanism by which normal cells are transformed into cancer cells through the action of free radicals, the following assumptions can be made. External free radicals enter normal cells and, on the one hand, destroy the structure of the most important chemical components in the cells (proteins, ribonucleic acid, and deoxyribonucleic acid), thereby also destroying the structure of enzymes, making them destructive enzymes. On the other hand, it also reduces the natural inhibitors in the cells that regulate the oxidation-reduction process. This leads to excessive cell growth and the proliferation of abnormal cells.

The chemical treatment of cancer is to inhibit the destructive proliferation of cells. Therefore, cancer cells must be deprived of the energy needed for growth, that is, the glycolysis and biological oxidation processes in cancer cells must be inhibited without affecting these processes in normal cells. Some effective inhibitors have been found and are being studied in depth. The speaker believes that the view of free radical carcinogenesis points out a reasonable path for cancer chemotherapy, but the action of free radicals is not the only cause of cancer.

Research on Nucleic Acids of Tumor Viruses

According to a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, ribonucleic acid isolated from tumor viruses [Note] can transform normal cells into cancer cells. Since a type of ribonucleic acid can transform normal cells into cancer cells, then it is possible to use another type of ribonucleic acid to transform cancer cells into normal cells.

The report said that the experiment used deoxyribonucleic acid isolated from polyomavirus of leukemic mice. The method is: first, cultivate the virus, and then remove its protein "coat"; injecting the virus's nucleic acid into hamsters causes the hamsters to develop tumors. However, if an enzyme that can only destroy deoxyribonucleic acid is added to the isolated nucleic acid, this nucleic acid will become non-infectious.

[Note] Regarding the causes of tumorigenesis, there are various different theories in academia. The virology theory of cancer is one of them. Some people have found viruses in certain animal cancers and have proven that these viruses can cause cancer. However, no one has yet been able to confirm that human cancers are also caused by viruses.

    自由基致癌的新见解
    苏联科学院通讯院士H·M·艾玛奴艾利2月27日在中国医学科学院，作了一次关于从物理化学观点看癌症问题以及癌症化学疗法的新原理的演讲。他说，有机化合物的自由基作用于组织有可能引起癌症，因此，应用自由基过程的抑制剂有可能治疗癌症。
    自由基是有机化合物中某一键在破裂后还未再结合时的存在物。用热分解乙基铅会生成自由的乙基。蛋白质和核酸受到物理因素（紫外线和电离辐射等）的作用也会产生自由基。射线作用于机体首先会使体内产生自由基。同时，人们早就已经知道，射线会使动物发生放射病或白血病。日本长崎和广岛受过原子弹的爆炸而遗有很多放射性，所以这两个城市的居民患白血病的百分率较其他城市为高。南方的居民因受强烈的日光照射而易患皮肤癌。这说明在光和射线的作用下所产生的自由基会引起癌症。此外，用阳光照射含有黄素辅基的酶类会产生自由基。辐射会在生物物质引起自由基的产生。许多已知的致癌物质（汽车废气、烟草焦油和煤焦油等）或者是本身含有自由基，或者是很容易产生自由基。这也说明自由基的作用会使正常细胞转变为癌细胞。
    关于正常细胞经过自由基的作用转变为癌细胞，其机制可以作如下假设。外界自由基进入正常细胞，一方面破坏了细胞中最重要的化学成分（蛋白质、核糖核酸和去氧核糖核酸）的结构，因而也破坏了酶的结构使其成为破坏性的酶，另一方面还减少了细胞内调节氧化还原过程的天然抑制剂。这就导致了细胞的过度生长和不正常细胞的繁殖。
    癌的化学治疗就是要抑制细胞的破坏性的繁殖，因此，必须使癌细胞得不到生长所需要的能量，即：必须抑制癌细胞中的糖酵解和生物氧化过程，却又不影响到正常细胞的这些过程。目前已经找到一些有效的抑制剂，正在进行深入的研究。演讲者认为，自由基致癌的见解为癌的化学治疗指出了合理的途径，但是自由基的作用也并不是致癌的唯一原因。
    对癌瘤病毒核酸的研究
    据美国科学院院报报道，由癌瘤病毒〔注〕分离出来的核糖核酸，能使正常细胞变成癌细胞。既然用一种核糖核酸能使正常细胞变成癌细胞，那末就有可能用另一种核糖核酸使癌细胞变成正常细胞。
    报道中说，实验所用的是一种从白血病鼠的多发瘤病毒分离出来的去氧核糖核酸。其方法是：首先培养病毒，然后去其蛋白质“外衣”；把病毒的核酸注射到田鼠的身上，就使田鼠发生瘤肿。但是，在分离出的核酸中加入一种仅能破坏去氧核糖核酸的酶，这种核酸就会变为没有传染性的。
    〔注〕关于癌瘤发生的原因，学术界有各种不同的说法。癌瘤的病毒学说是其中的一种。有些人已经在动物的某些癌瘤中找到了病毒，并且证明了这些病毒能引起癌瘤。但是，至今还没有人能确证人类的癌瘤也是病毒所引起的。
