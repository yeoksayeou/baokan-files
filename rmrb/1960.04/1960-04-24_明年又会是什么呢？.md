    "What Will Next Year Bring?"
    Li Dongsheng
    Every day, when we open the newspaper, a brand new scene unfolds before our eyes, displaying the vigorous vitality of all things. However, in the spring of our era, the appearance of things is not just new every year, but new every month, new every day. It is not only changing with each passing day, but also changing in an instant.
    "The Huaibei Plain has changed its appearance, the land is woven into a network of silver rivers, the past was a stretch of sandy land, now the fragrance of rice flowers is everywhere," this is the praise of the members of the Jilunzhai Commune in Guoyang County, Anhui, for the new scenery of Huaibei; "In the morning, you see a pile of bricks on the ground, in the evening, you see red buildings among the white clouds;" this is the drawing of the infrastructure workers of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company constructing at high speed; "Every street and alley runs factories, every household has no idle people," the establishment of urban people's communes has brought about tremendous changes in people's lives and spiritual outlook. Due to the large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution, the vigorous cultural revolution, and the great emphasis on organizing the people's economic life, drastic changes are taking place everywhere from cities to villages, from factories to mines. New people and new things emerge one after another, the old becomes new, and the new becomes newer. At the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress, a representative, in his speech, summarized the characteristics of our era in four sentences, called "Millions of people are of one mind, ten thousand horses gallop, a riot of color, and everything is renewed." These four "ten thousands" are not only true, vivid, and image-like, but also very thought-provoking.
    In our country, why can we see such a great situation of "ten thousand horses galloping, a riot of color, and everything being renewed?" The most important reason is that "millions of people are of one mind." Millions of people being of one mind reflects the confidence and determination of hundreds of millions of people under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao to strive to achieve a sustained great leap forward, to strive to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and to strive to build socialism and enter communism as soon as possible. Six hundred and fifty million hearts are linked into one heart, six hundred and fifty million hands are twisted into one rope, and six hundred and fifty million people leap onto the galloping horse and sprint towards the splendid goal of socialism and communism; pacesetters are lined up, red flags become forests, and the flowers of technical innovation bloom in all walks of life, one link after another, one wave higher than another, pushing the socialist construction cause from one upsurge to a new upsurge.
    "Many people generate great enthusiasm," hundreds of millions of people are not afraid of poverty, not afraid of difficulties, are in high spirits, dare to think and dare to act, give full play to their intelligence and talents, work together, move mountains, fill the sea, make great innovations, and send away the plague god, which will inevitably make our country's face brand new. The renewal of everything is as rapid as a "myth." This great reality reflects the unity of the entire party and the entire people, demonstrates the victory of the Party's mass line, shows that the three red flags have penetrated the hearts of the people across the country, and demonstrates the vigorous development of the communist spirit of the Chinese people and the spirit of continuous revolution.
    Not long ago, at the Leipzig Spring Fair, a foreign friend saw the ever-changing exhibits from our country and asked with amazement: "What will next year bring?" This is indeed a very interesting question. What will next year bring? We can definitely answer: newer achievements, newer products, newer scenes.

### “明年又会是什么呢？”

    “明年又会是什么呢？”
    李冬生
    每天打开报纸，展现在眼前的总是一片崭新的景象，万物显示出的蓬勃生机。但是，在我们时代的春天里，万象已经不是一年一新，而是月月新，日日新，不仅日新月异，而且瞬息万变。
    “淮北平原变了样，大地织成银河网，过去一片砂矼地，如今处处稻花香”，这是安徽涡阳县纪伦寨公社社员对淮北新景的赞歌；“早看平地一堆砖，暮看红楼白云间”；这是马鞍山钢铁公司基建工人以高速度进行建设的画图”；“街街巷巷办工厂，家家户户无闲人”，城市人民公社的建立又使人民生活和精神面貌发生了多么巨大的变化。由于大搞技术革新和技术革命，大闹文化革命，大抓组织人民经济生活，从城市到农村，从工厂到矿山，处处都在发生急剧的变化。新人新事层出不穷，旧的变新，新的更新。在全国人民代表大会二届二次会议上，一位代表在发言时曾把我们时代的特征概括为四句话，叫做“万众一心，万马奔腾，万紫千红，万象更新”，这四个“万”字，不仅真实、生动、形象，而且非常耐人寻味。
    在我们国家里，为什么能够出现“万马奔腾，万紫千红，万象更新”的大好局面呢？一个最重要的原因，就是“万众一心”。万众一心反映出在党和毛主席的英明领导下，亿万人民争取实现持续大跃进，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗，争取早日建成社会主义，进入共产主义的信心和决心。六亿五千万颗心连成一颗心，六亿五千万双手拧成一股绳，六亿五千万人民纵身跃上千里马，朝着社会主义、共产主义的灿烂目标飞奔；标兵成列，红旗成林，技术革新之花开遍各行各业，一环扣一环，一浪高一浪，把社会主义建设事业从一个高潮推向一个新的高潮。
    “人多热气大”，亿万人民不怕贫穷，不怕困难，精神振奋，敢想敢干，充分发挥聪明才智，同心协力，移掉山，填平海，大闹革新，送走瘟神，这就必然会使我们国家的面貌焕然一新。万象更新神速得如同“神话”。这个伟大的现实反映了全党全民的团结一致，表现了党的群众路线的胜利，说明了三面红旗已经深入全国人民的心坎，显示了中国人民共产主义精神的蓬勃发展和不断革命的奋进精神。
    前不久，在来比锡春季博览会上，一位外国朋友看到我国日新月异的展品，带着惊叹的口气问道：“明年又会是什么呢？”这确是一个非常有趣的问题，明年又会是什么呢？我们可以肯定的回答是：更新的成绩，更新的产品，更新的景象。
