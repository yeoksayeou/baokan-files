Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st—Since its establishment more than a year ago, the Qiaodong People's Commune in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, which is composed of urban residents and agricultural populations, has been thriving and undergoing tremendous changes, shining everywhere with the brilliance of the People's Commune.

Shijiazhuang is an emerging industrial city. Since liberation, some modern factories such as textile and chemical plants have been built here. Because Shijiazhuang's small-scale industry was originally relatively weak, many of the raw materials, small tools, and daily necessities for the employees of some large factories had to rely on long-distance supply from large cities such as Tianjin and Beijing. After the establishment of the Qiaodong Commune, the commune, in light of local characteristics, established 69 factories with more than 9,500 employees. In addition, 345 production teams were also established. These commune-run industries have become a strong assistant to large-scale industry, playing a significant role in supporting large-scale industrial production and meeting the needs of the people's lives. Among the commune's 801 types of products, 306 are for serving large-scale industry, including 60 major products such as hydrochloric acid, electrical switches, and refractory materials. Last year, the commune-run industry produced more than 900 tons of hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, supplying the needs of more than ten large factories. The dehydrated activated carbon manufactured by the commune's woodworking factory using sawdust waste has become the raw material for modern Huabei Pharmaceutical Factory to produce high-grade medicines such as penicillin and streptomycin, and the quality fully meets the requirements. Commune-run industry also produces 237 kinds of daily necessities for the people's lives, such as knitwear, clothing, food, enamelware, and glassware. Last year alone, the production of only four products, namely towels, pillow towels, socks, and thread blankets, reached more than 290,000 dozens. Among the products of commune-run industry, there are also more than ten kinds of products such as light bulbs, bicycles, canned food, dairy products, and electrical switches. These are all products that Shijiazhuang City has never produced in the past. In the first quarter of this year, according to statistics from 16 units, 36 new products such as enameled wire, large canvas, woolen cloth, and road maintenance machines have been successfully trial-produced.

After the establishment of the Qiaodong Commune, the mutual collaboration and support between industry and agriculture were strongly strengthened, promoting the double leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. After the commune had an industrial "base," it was able to better support agricultural production and accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture. The commune industry has 59 kinds of products specifically for supporting agricultural production. Last year alone, it manufactured more than 140,000 pieces of various agricultural implements, 150,000 pieces of vehicle and horse equipment, 6,700 tons of local fertilizer, and also repaired 137,000 pieces of agricultural implements. This year, the commune's agricultural production teams are going to vigorously develop garden field windbreaks to ensure early maturity and increased production of vegetables. The commune Party committee convened a cooperation meeting of the whole commune and promptly transferred a large number of reed mats and reeds from various aspects to supply the agricultural production teams, solving the need for establishing windbreaks for more than 1,100 mu of garden fields. Last year alone, the commune's factories, institutions, and schools supported the commune's 22 agricultural production teams with a large number of materials, enabling more than 40,000 mu of land in the commune to basically achieve irrigation mechanization and electrification. Last year alone, the commune's factories, institutions, schools, etc. also sent people to the countryside during the busy farming season to support agricultural production, reaching more than 300,000 person-times throughout the year. The agricultural production teams also take the development of vegetables and meat as the key link, and use the bumper harvest of agricultural and sideline products to support the needs of industry. Last year, the commune's production teams produced a total of more than 80 million catties of vegetables, so that everyone in the commune could eat one and a half catties of vegetables every day. Now, the whole commune is expanding the production of agricultural and sideline foods based on the agricultural production teams. The number of pigs raised has reached more than 14,000, more than 74,000 chickens, and more than 120,000 fish, providing a guarantee for gradually increasing the supply of non-staple foods.

The Qiaodong People's Commune was established in November 1958. Among its more than 150,000 members, there are 115,000 urban residents and 35,000 agricultural population. Among the urban resident members, more than 90% are family members of employees. With the rapid development of socialist construction, they are eager to step out of their homes and participate in social production. The promulgation of the Party's General Line in 1958 and the Great Leap Forward in production further encouraged their confidence in participating in production. As a result, various forms of production organizations and living organizations emerged. Eighteen family members of employees in Zhengdong Street set up a March 8th Women's Foundry, which boosted the morale of women in this area. The women went from house to house, spreading the news. In just three or four months, 477 production stalls were set up in the Qiaodong District, and a large number of housewives and idle laborers participated in production. After the production was organized, the masses requested the socialization of housework, so they set up mutual aid canteens and nurseries. In addition, 458 households organized mutual aid groups for housework, taking turns to help their neighbors or neighbors with housework. At this time, Chairman Mao pointed out that "the People's Commune is still good," and a high tide of the people's commune system appeared in the countryside. Under the leadership of the Party organization, the people of Qiaodong District formally established the People's Commune.

After the establishment of the commune, it vigorously developed production on the one hand, and with the development of production, it held many collective welfare undertakings. Now, more than 69,000 people in the commune eat in 367 canteens, and 182 nurseries and kindergartens have been established, accommodating more than 6,000 children; temporary nurseries and kindergartens have also been organized for children who are not in nurseries, so that parents can happily participate in production and learning. The commune also formed comprehensive shops, forming a dotted commercial network and service network, by combining department stores, non-staple foods, vegetables and other industries according to the characteristics of the region and the distribution of members. The commune has established 117 service stations and 348 service groups. The commune has also established four homes for the elderly, where 34 elderly people are living a happy old age. The commune's medical and health network has also been established. There are currently five hospitals and 17 clinics in the commune. In the commune's health network, in addition to full-time medical staff, many members also serve as voluntary health workers, and they are distributed in various streets, playing a great role in maintaining the health of the masses and improving the health conditions of the commune.

After the vast number of members participated in productive labor, they eagerly requested to improve their political, cultural and technical level. The commune first eliminated illiteracy among all members aged 14 to 45, and established a formal and spare-time education network. Now the commune has set up one ordinary middle school, technical middle school and agricultural middle school, and also set up 35 elementary schools, so that elementary education has been popularized throughout the commune. The commune now has two vocational secondary technical specialty classes, one university specialty class, and 122 spare-time middle schools, with more than 16,000 young and middle-aged employees enrolled, accounting for 94% of the number of people who should be enrolled.

With the development of production, the economic income of the members of the Qiaodong Commune has gradually increased. According to a survey of 131 members in Minsheng Street, the monthly living expenses per person increased from 11 yuan to 17 yuan. The average income per agricultural member has also increased by more than 25% compared with 1958. The spiritual outlook of the members has also undergone great changes, and new customs of loving the collective, unity and mutual assistance have appeared everywhere. (Attached picture)

    城市居民和农民携手前进　大办工业大办集体福利事业
    桥东公社工农业生产比翼齐飞
    社办工业成为大工业的助手，有力地支援了农业技术改造
    新华社天津21日电　河北省石家庄市由城市居民和农业人口共同组成的桥东人民公社成立一年多来百业兴旺，面貌日新月异，到处闪烁着人民公社的光辉。
    石家庄是一个新兴的工业城市。解放后，这里兴建了一些纺织、化工等现代化工厂。由于石家庄的小型工业原来基础比较薄弱，有些大工厂需要的原料材料、小型工具和职工生活日用品，很多都要依靠天津、北京等大城市远路供应。桥东公社成立以后，公社针对当地的特点，办起了六十九个工厂，职工达九千五百多人。另外还举办了三百四十五个生产小组。这些社办工业已经成为大工业的有力助手，对支援大工业生产和满足人民生活需要起了很大作用。全社八百零一种产品中，就有三百零六种是为大工业服务的，其中主要的产品有盐酸、电器开关、耐火材料等六十种，去年，社办工业生产的九百多吨盐酸和硫酸，供应了十多个大工厂的需要。公社木器制造厂利用锯末废料制造的脱水活性碳，成为现代化的华北制药厂生产青霉素、链霉素等高级药品的原料，而且质量完全合乎要求。社办工业还生产着针织品、服装、食品、搪瓷、玻璃制品等二百三十七种人民生活日用品。去年一年，仅是毛巾、枕巾、袜子和线毯四种产品就生产了二十九万多打。在社办工业的产品中，还有电灯泡、自行车、罐头、奶品、电器开关等十多种产品。这些都是石家庄市过去从来没有生产过的。今年第一季度，据十六个单位的统计，又试制成功了漆包线、大帆布、有线呢、养路机等三十六种新产品。
    桥东公社成立后，有力地加强了工农业之间的互相协作、互相支援，促进了工农业生产双跃进。公社有了工业“基地”以后，就能更好地支援农业生产和加快农业的技术改造。公社工业专为支援农业生产的产品就有五十九种，去年一年制造了各种农具十四万多件，车马装具十五万件，土化肥六千七百多吨，还修配了十三万七千多件农具。今年公社的农业生产队要大搞园田风障化，以保证蔬菜早熟增产，公社党委召开了全社的协作会议，及时从各方面抽调了大批芦席、苇子供应农业生产队，解决了一千一百多亩园田设立风障的需要。去年一年，公社的工厂、机关、学校支援了全社二十二个农业生产队大批物资，使全社四万多亩土地基本上实现了灌溉机械化和电气化。去年一年，公社的工厂、机关、学校等还在农忙时抽人下乡支援农业生产，全年达三十多万人次。农业生产队也以发展蔬菜、肉食为纲，以农副业的丰产来支援工业的需要。去年公社生产队共生产蔬菜八千多万斤，使全社每人每天能吃到一斤半蔬菜。现在，全社正以农业生产队为基点，扩大农副食品的生产，养猪已达一万四千多头，鸡七万四千多只，鱼十二万多尾，为逐步增加副食品的供应提供了保证。
    桥东人民公社是1958年11月成立的。它的十五万多名社员中，有十一万五千名城市居民和三万五千名农业人口。城市居民社员中，又有90％以上是职工家属。随着社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，她们迫切希望走出家门，参加社会生产。1958年党的总路线公布和生产的大跃进，更加鼓舞了她们参加生产的信心。于是各种形式的生产组织、生活组织应运而生。正东街有十八名职工家属办起了一座三八妇女翻砂厂，给这一带的妇女长了志气，妇女们纷纷串门连户，奔走相告。仅在短短的三、四个月中，原桥东区一带就办起了四百七十七个生产摊子，有大批的家庭妇女和闲散劳力参加了生产。生产组织起来以后，群众又要求家务劳动社会化，就办起了互助食堂、托儿所。另外还有四百五十八户组织了家务劳动互助组，轮流值日帮助同院或邻居办理家务。这时，毛主席指出了“还是人民公社好”，农村中出现了人民公社化的高潮，桥东区的人民就在党组织的领导下正式成立了人民公社。
    公社成立以后，一面大力发展生产，并且随着生产的发展举办了许多集体福利事业。现在全社有六万九千多人在三百六十七个食堂里吃饭，托儿所和幼儿园已建立一百八十二个，收托着六千多名儿童；还为没有入托的儿童组织了临时性的托儿所、幼儿园，使家长都能愉快地参加生产和学习。公社还根据本地区的特点和社员分布情况，把百货、副食品、蔬菜等行业组成综合商店，形成了星罗棋布的商业网和服务网。公社建立了一百一十七个服务站和三百四十八个服务组。公社还建立了四个敬老院，有三十四名老人在院内过着幸福的晚年生活。公社的医药卫生网也已建立起来，全社现有五所医院和十七个门诊部。在公社的卫生网里，除了专职的医务人员外，还有许多社员担任义务卫生人员，他们分布在各个街道，对维护群众健康、改善全社卫生状况起了很大作用。
    广大社员参加生产劳动以后，迫切要求提高政治、文化和技术水平，公社首先扫除了全社十四岁到四十五岁的文盲，并且建立起了正规的和业余的教育网。现在公社办起了普通中学、技工中学和农业中学各一所，还办了小学三十五所，使全社普及了小学教育。全社现在办有业余中等技术专业班二个，大学专业班一个和一百二十二个业余中学，入学的青壮年职工达到一万六千多人，占应入学人数的94％。
    随着生产的发展，桥东公社社员的经济收入也逐步有了增加。据民生街一百三十一名社员的调查，每人每月的生活费由十一元增加到十七元。农业社员平均每人的收入，也比1958年增加25％以上。社员们的精神面貌也有了很大改变，到处出现了热爱集体、团结互助的新风尚。（附图片）
