Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd - Seoul Dispatch: The South Korean people's struggle against the fascist rule of the US-Syngman Rhee clique continues to erupt. In Incheon, an important port city near Seoul, a massive demonstration of 28,000 people broke out again today.

The Syngman Rhee clique continues to implement strict news censorship, prohibiting South Korean news agencies and radio stations from reporting news about the people's opposition to the tyranny of the US-Syngman Rhee clique. However, according to foreign news agencies, the demonstration began at 9:30 in the morning. Initially, 2,000 students held a demonstration in front of the Incheon City "Government," protesting Syngman Rhee's use of various despicable means in the March 15th "election." They shouted slogans against police suppression and other slogans. The police fired shots to intimidate the demonstrators, and the students angrily fought back.

The students' demonstration received widespread support from the citizens. Many citizens also joined the ranks of the demonstrators. The demonstration team grew larger and larger. By around 4:00 in the afternoon, the number of demonstrators had increased to 28,000. After a five-hour demonstration, the demonstrators said that they would continue the demonstration tomorrow.

Seoul and the southern cities of Daegu and Daejeon are still very tense, and martial law and curfew have not been lifted. The Syngman Rhee puppet army continues to search for demonstrators in Seoul.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st - New York Dispatch: The heroic struggle of the South Korean people against the bloody rule of Syngman Rhee, supported by American bayonets, has greatly shocked the American bourgeois newspapers. Many newspapers have published commentaries, offering advice and strategies to the American ruling group and Syngman Rhee, in an attempt to extinguish the flames of the South Korean people's struggle.

The "Washington Evening Star" on the 20th menacingly shouted: "We believe that force must be used (against the South Korean people), and force must continue to be used until order is restored." This newspaper slandered the people who rose up to resist the dark rule of Syngman Rhee as "mobs." It said that at the current stage, South Korea can only choose from two approaches: "Submitting to the rule of the mob or using force." The newspaper said without concealment that if force is not used, "the Syngman Rhee government will fall, and we do not think this is what the (American) State Department wants." This newspaper advocated that the American authorities openly support the bloody suppression of the South Korean people.

Other American newspapers had to admit that the Syngman Rhee clique had lost the support of the people and were worried about whether their bloody suppression could maintain the crumbling US-Syngman Rhee rule.

These American newspapers demanded that Syngman Rhee take more subtle measures to ease the people's dissatisfaction.

    南朝鲜人民反对美李集团斗争继续发展
    仁川二万八千人举行大示威
    美国报纸纷纷出谋献策企图扑灭南朝鲜人民斗争火焰
    新华社平壤22日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜人民反对美李集团法西斯统治的斗争还在此起彼伏地继续发展。在汉城附近的重要港口仁川市，今天又爆发了两万八千人的大示威。
    李承晚集团继续实行严密的新闻封锁，禁止南朝鲜通讯社和电台报道有关人民反对美李集团暴政的消息。但是据外国通讯社透露，这次示威是从早晨九点半开始的。起初是二千名学生到仁川市“政府”前面举行示威，抗议李承晚在3月15日的“选举”中施用各种卑鄙手段。他们高呼反对警察镇压等口号。警察鸣枪向示威群众恫吓，学生愤怒地进行反击。
    学生们的示威受到市民们的广泛支持。许多市民也参加了示威的行列，示威的队伍越来越多，到下午四时左右，示威人数增加到两万八千人。在五个小时的示威结束后，示威者们表示明天要继续举行示威。
    汉城以及南部地区的大丘、大田等城市仍然很紧张，戒严和宵禁仍未取消。李伪军在汉城继续搜捕示威者。
    据新华社21日讯　纽约消息：南朝鲜人民反对美国刺刀支持下的李承晚血腥统治的英勇斗争使美国资产阶级报刊大为震惊，许多报刊发表评论，为美国统治集团和李承晚出谋献策，以扑灭南朝鲜人民的斗争火焰。
    “华盛顿明星晚报”20日狰狞地叫嚷说：“我们认为必须（对南朝鲜人民）使用武力，而且必须继续使用武力直到秩序恢复为止”。这家报纸诬蔑起来反抗李承晚黑暗统治的人民为“暴徒”。它说，在目前阶段南朝鲜只能从两种作法中作一选择：“屈服于暴徒的统治或者使用武力”。报纸毫不隐讳地说，假如不使用武力，“李承晚政府就要倒台，而我们并不认为这是（美国）国务院所希望的”。这家报纸主张美国当局公开支持对南朝鲜人民的血腥镇压。
    另一些美国报纸不得不承认李承晚集团已经失尽人心的事实，担心他们血腥的镇压能否维持美李摇摇欲坠的统治。
    这些美国报纸要求李承晚采取比较巧妙的办法来缓和人民的不满。
