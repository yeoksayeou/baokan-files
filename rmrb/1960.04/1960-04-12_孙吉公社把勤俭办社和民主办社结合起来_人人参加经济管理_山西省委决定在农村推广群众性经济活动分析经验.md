Sunji Commune Combines Diligent and Thrifty Management with Democratic Management
    Everyone Participates in Economic Management
    Shanxi Provincial Party Committee Decides to Promote the Experience of Mass Economic Activity Analysis in Rural Areas

    (Our dispatch) Since 1959, Sunji People's Commune in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, has fully mobilized the masses and carried out mass economic activity analysis based on the principles of diligent and thrifty commune management and democratic commune management. This has made business management more adaptable to the needs of large-scale production and has vigorously promoted the development of production.

    Sunji Commune is located in a loess plateau area, with irrigated land accounting for only two-thousandths of the total cultivated land. In 1959, it suffered a hundred-day drought, but thanks to the mass economic activity analysis, it opened up new sources of income, reduced expenditures in many ways, expanded production avenues, and saved investment costs. This enabled human, material, and financial resources to play a greater role in production, achieving a great harvest in a disaster year. The total grain output of the commune increased by 11% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the total value of agricultural and sideline products increased by 18%, production costs decreased from 26% of total income in 1958 to 21%, and management costs decreased from 0.6% of total income in 1958 to 0.38%. Public accumulation increased by 12%, which ensured that 91% of the members increased their income compared to the previous year.

    At the beginning of 1959, the commune Party committee conducted a comprehensive review of the implementation of production plans and revenue and expenditure plans of the commune's ten management areas in 1958. It found that seven management areas had increased income and reduced expenditures, while three management areas had large investments but failed to complete their production plans, resulting in reduced production and income or increased production but reduced income. In response, the commune Party committee first summarized the experience of Sunji Management Area, where production had increased year by year and costs had decreased year by year, and concluded that vigorously carrying out mass economic activity analysis was a good way to implement diligent and thrifty commune management, improve business management, and ensure increased production and income. To this end, this experience was promoted throughout the commune.

    In carrying out mass economic activity analysis, Sunji Commune closely focused on the three indicators of increased production plans, revenue and expenditure plans, and labor productivity, and continuously analyzed and studied issues such as land, labor, capital, and equipment, which play a decisive role in production. It sought experiences in improving land utilization, increasing labor productivity, and reducing production costs in many ways to ensure the realization of the indicators. Their analysis methods mainly include the following five:

    I. Specialists study and improve the system. Look at problems from the figures, seek experience, and turn dead figures into living teaching materials. In addition to a complete set of books, each management area has established a set of twelve tables, including monthly, team-based, and crop-based labor attendance and work investment plan completion status tables, production cost, management cost, and public accumulation actual expenditure plan comparison tables, and agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production progress tables. Financial personnel regularly announce the information they have to the masses and report it to the leaders of their units, so that the leaders can understand the situation, be clear about the situation, and facilitate timely research and resolution of problems. For example, on February 5 this year, the Sunji Management Area Party branch received a question from the financial section: "Non-productive labor in January exceeded the plan by 55%, while the production investment plan was only 8% completed." The branch immediately handed this issue over to the members for discussion to find the reason. It was found that out of the 890 laborers in the entire management area, only 594 were directly involved in production, while the health professional team and the cultural professional team occupied 39 laborers.... Based on the opinions of the members, the branch immediately adjusted and reduced 110 non-productive personnel and invested them in spring plowing production.

    II. Each management area has established a business management night school, which regularly publishes various figures in the form of charts, pictures, and oral reports to mobilize the masses to compare with the advanced, promote the backward, find tricks, and offer suggestions. The night school stipulates that classes are held once every five days, making the business management night school a good place for members to participate in learning, participate in management, reflect problems, and conduct economic activity analysis. The walls of each night school have columns such as "See which team is doing well in production" and "See which team has low production costs." This allows members to compare the speed of production progress, the size of production investment, and the completion of work investment plans of each team at any time from the columns. After analysis and comparison, they accept experiences and lessons and immediately set off a climax of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced.

    III. During the main production seasons such as spring sowing, summer harvesting, autumn harvesting, and autumn planting, the commune Party committee promptly seizes key issues such as how to improve labor productivity and improve land utilization, and first conducts analysis and research among leading cadres of management areas and production teams, so that they can understand the problems in each period, and then lead the masses of their units to conduct analysis. In order to improve land utilization, last summer harvest, the commune Party committee summarized the experience of Xili Management Area in implementing crop rotation and obtaining a bumper harvest of wheat, and immediately organized more than 300 district and team cadres to visit the site for analysis, so that everyone learned how to use old stubble land to rotate cotton, old stubble cotton land to change to wheat, returning stubble autumn to retain as cotton or peas, and pea, alfalfa, and melon and vegetable land to rotate wheat, etc., which not only did not reduce the summer sowing area, but also suppressed the proportion of returning stubble wheat. Based on this experience, various localities universally mobilized the masses and democratically formulated a five-year crop rotation plan for land, ensuring that the returning stubble wheat field of the entire commune this year decreased from 39% of the total wheat field last year to 21%. This laid the foundation for this year's wheat to break through the 300-jin mark.

    IV. Everyone proposes topics, everyone offers suggestions. Concentrate on the common problems raised by the masses in each period and conduct special analysis. In August last year, when the completion of the commune's cotton and autumn field production increase plans was greatly affected by the prolonged drought, the members took the initiative to propose the idea of supplementing agriculture with sideline industries and supplementing grain with vegetables. Based on the opinions of the masses, the commune Party committee launched a special analysis of "How to turn disaster into abundance," and the members put forward more than 17,000 rationalization proposals.

    V. At the end of the year-end distribution, organized a general inspection, general evaluation, general summary, and general analysis of the whole people, comprehensively summarized experiences and lessons, and democratically formulated advanced, solid and feasible production leap forward indicators. A competition was launched between districts and districts, teams and teams, and people and people to compare the increase in production ratio, the increase in labor productivity, and the reduction in costs. This made the cadres and members more clearly understand that only by fully relying on the masses, conscientiously implementing the policy of diligence and thrift in commune management and democratic commune management, strengthening economic accounting, and saving expenses can the goal of increasing production and income be achieved. Based on summarizing last year's experiences and lessons, it was formulated that this year's total agricultural and sideline income will be increased by 30% compared to last year, production costs will be reduced from 21.5% of total income to 19%, management costs will be reduced from 0.38% of total income to 0.15%, the value created by each laborer will be increased from 800 yuan to 1,000 yuan, and grain production will be increased from 2,000 jin to 2,800 jin. All cadres and members, in order to achieve this new goal, have set off a new production upsurge and are continuously carrying out mass economic activity analysis around production in a more in-depth and detailed manner.

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) recently studied the experience of mass economic activity analysis in Sunji People's Commune, Wanrong County. It believes that this is a good form of combining diligence and thrift in commune management with democratic commune management, combining leading cadres, financial personnel and the masses, developing the production and conservation campaign with greater, faster, better and more economical results, improving the level of business management, and consolidating people's communes. They decided to vigorously promote it in all people's communes in the province.

    孙吉公社把勤俭办社和民主办社结合起来
    人人参加经济管理
    山西省委决定在农村推广群众性经济活动分析经验
    本报讯　山西万荣县孙吉人民公社从1959年开始，根据勤俭办社和民主办社的原则，充分发动群众，开展群众性的经济活动分析，使经营管理工作适应大生产的要求，越做越细，有力地促进了生产的发展。
    孙吉公社是个黄土高原区，水地仅占总耕地面积的千分之二。1959年遭受百日大旱侵袭，但由于开展了群众性的经济活动分析，从多方面开源节流，扩大生产门路，节约投资费用，使人力、物力和财力在生产上发挥了更大的作用，实现了灾年大丰收，全社粮食总产量比大跃进的1958年增加11％，农副总产值增长18％，生产费由1958年占总收入26％降低到21％，管理费由1958年占总收入0.6％降低到0.38％。公共积累增长12％，从而保证了91％的社员比上年增加了收入。
    1959年初，公社党委对全社十个管理区1958年生产计划、收支计划的执行情况进行了一次全面检查，发展有七个管理区收入增加，开支降低；有三个管理区投资大，生产计划没完成，形成减产减收或增产减收。针对这种情况，公社党委首先总结了生产逐年提高，成本逐年降低的孙吉管理区的经验，认为大搞群众性的经济活动分析，是贯彻勤俭办社，改善经营管理，保证增产增收的好办法。为此，在全公社推广了这一经验。
    孙吉公社在开展群众性的经济活动分析中，紧紧围绕增产计划、收支计划和劳动生产率这三个指标，突出的抓住对生产中起决定作用的土地、劳力、资金、设备等问题不断地进行分析研究，多方面寻找提高土地利用率、提高劳动生产率和降低生产成本的经验，保证指标的实现。他们分析的方法，主要有以下五种：
    一、专人研究，健全制度。从数字中看问题，寻经验，变死数字为活教材。各管理区除健全一套完整的账簿外，还建立了一套分月、分队、分作物的劳动出勤和投工计划完成情况表，生产费、管理费、公共积累实支计划对照表，农、林、牧、副、渔各种生产进度表等十二种。财务人员将自己所掌握的资料，一面定期向群众作公布，一面报告给本单位领导，使领导摸清家底，心中有数，便于及时研究解决问题。例如：今年2月5日，孙吉管理区党支部接到财务股提出的一个问题：“1月份非生产用工超过计划55％，而生产投资计划，只完成8％”。支部马上把这个问题交给社员讨论，寻找原因，发现全管理区八百九十个劳力，直接参加生产的只有五百九十四人，而卫生专业队和文化专业队就占用了三十九个劳力……。支部根据社员意见，立即调整和压缩了一百一十个非生产人员，投入了春耕生产。
    二、各管理区都成立了经营管理夜校，定期用图表、图片和口头报告的形式，公布各种数字，发动群众比先进，促落后，找窍门，献计策。夜校规定五天上课一次，使经营管理夜校真正成为社员参加学习、参加管理、反映问题、进行经济活动分析的好场所。各个夜校的墙壁上都设有“看那个队生产搞的好”“看那个队生产成本低”等栏目。使社员们随时从栏目中比较各队生产进度的快慢、生产投资的大小、投工计划完成的好坏，经过分析对比，接受经验教训，立即掀起了学先进赶先进的高潮。
    三、在春播、夏收、秋收、秋种等主要生产季节，公社党委及时抓住如何提高劳动生产率，提高土地利用率等关键性的问题，先在管理区、生产队领导干部中进行分析研究，使他们摸清了各个时期的问题，然后领导本单位的群众进行分析。为了提高土地利用率，去年夏收时期，公社党委总结了西里管理区实行轮作倒茬，获得小麦特大丰收的经验，当即组织了三百多名区、队干部到现场参观分析，使大家学会了用老茬地倒茬棉花、老茬棉地改种小麦、回茬秋留作棉花或豌豆，豌豆、苜蓿、瓜菜地倒茬小麦等办法，既不减少夏播面积，又能压低回茬麦的比例。根据这个经验各地普遍发动群众，民主制订了土地五年轮作倒茬规划，保证全社今年回茬麦田由去年占总麦田39％下降到21％。这就为今年小麦突破三百斤大关，奠定了增产的基础。
    四、大家出题目，大家献计策。集中各个时期群众提出来带有普遍性的问题，进行专题分析。去年8月间，久旱不雨，全社棉花、秋田的增产计划的完成受到很大的影响的时候，社员们主动提出了农业丢了副业补，粮食丢了蔬菜补的意见。公社党委根据群众意见，开展了全民性的“如何变灾为丰”的专题分析，社员们提出一万七千多条合理化建议。
    五、在年终分配结束的时候，组织了全民性的大检查、大评比、大总结、大分析，全面总结经验教训，民主制定先进扎实可行的生产跃进指标。在区与区、队与队、人与人之间，又开展了比提高增产比例，比提高劳动生产率，比降低成本的竞赛。这样使干部和社员更清楚地懂得了只有充分依靠群众，认真贯彻勤俭办社和民主办社的方针，加强经济核算，节约开支，才能达到增产增收的目的。在总结去年的经验教训的基础上，制订出今年农副业总收入比去年提高30％，生产费用由占总收入21.5％，降低为19％，管理费用由占总收入0.38％，降低为0.15％，每个劳力创造价值由八百元提高到一千元，生产粮食由二千斤提高到二千八百斤。全体干部和社员，为实现这个新的指标，掀起了新的生产高潮，更深入细微地围绕着生产，不断的开展群众性的经济活动分析。
    又讯　中共山西省委最近研究了万荣县孙吉公社的群众性的经济活动分析经验以后，认为这是勤俭办社和民主办社相结合，领导干部、财务人员和群众相结合，多快好省地开展增产节约运动，提高经营管理水平，巩固人民公社的一种好形式，决定在全省各人民公社中大力推广。
