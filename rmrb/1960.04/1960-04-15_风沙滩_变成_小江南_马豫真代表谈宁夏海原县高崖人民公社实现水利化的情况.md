Comrade Chairman, Fellow Deputies:

    I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, and I am determined to implement them in my practical work.

    Now, I will discuss the situation of the Hui and Han members of the Gao Ya People's Commune in Haiyuan County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, who overcame drought and achieved water conservancy.

    The Gao Ya People's Commune in Haiyuan County is a joint commune of Hui and Han nationalities. Under the illumination of the Party's General Line, all Hui and Han members, after more than a year of hard work, have transformed this "sandy beach," which was severely lacking in "three waters" (rainwater, surface water, and groundwater), with frequent winds and little rain, and plagued by drought nine years out of ten, into a "Little Jiangnan" with reservoirs everywhere, crisscrossing canals, and densely packed terraced fields. Now the entire commune has 50,000 mu of irrigated land, averaging 4.5 mu per person, achieving water conservancy.

    A History of More Tears Than Water

    "Nine out of ten years are barren, the poor suffer disasters, half a year of bran and vegetable meals, half a year fleeing to other places, families are hard to reunite, families are broken and people die." This is a true reflection of the painful lives of the Gao Ya people before liberation. In the past, in the western part of the commune, there were steep mountains, all barren hills with no trees and very little grass. When it rained, mountain floods erupted, causing serious soil erosion. Although the east, south, and north sides of the commune were the flat Gao Ya Plain, it was severely lacking in "three waters": surface water consisted only of floodwaters discharged from the Shixiakou after heavy rain, with no other rivers; groundwater was very deep and all bitter water unsuitable for irrigation; and annual rainfall was only about 200 mm, mostly concentrated in August and September. According to historical records, from 1927 to 1949, there were twenty major and minor droughts.

    Before liberation, due to the severe threat of drought, the yield per unit area of grain was only 20 jin; even in the best years, it was no more than 40 jin. In years of severe drought, crops withered and died, and there was no grass, leaving barren land for miles. People and livestock had to travel 30 to 40 li to fetch water. Farmers who did not have livestock to carry water had to buy water from landlords, rich peasants, and speculators at exorbitant prices during the dry season. Before liberation, water vendors in Xinglongbao sold water at a high price of one silver dollar per load (equivalent to the price of two dou of grain), sometimes even two or three silver dollars could not buy it. Coupled with the oppression and exploitation of the reactionary government, the poor Hui and Han farmers had no choice but to "run away as the best option." In drought years, poor farmers took their wives and children and fled famine. In the great drought of 1929, 8% of the farmers fled. Of the 37 households in Gao Ya Village, all but six old men fled.

    A Thousand-Year Dream, Realized in One Year

    Changing the drought situation was a dream that the Gao Ya people had cherished for thousands of years. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the heroic Hui and Han people of Gao Ya launched a tenacious struggle against the severe drought and constantly achieved victories.

    In the spring of 1958, encouraged by the Party's General Line for building socialism, the Gao Ya Party organization and the Hui and Han people together summarized the experience of water conservancy construction over the years, specifically studied the natural characteristics of the Gao Ya area, and believed that to change the drought situation in Gao Ya, it was necessary to make full use of floodwaters. Therefore, it was decided to build a reservoir in the Shixiakou valley to completely change the drought situation in the Gao Ya area. However, building such a huge reservoir first encountered the difficulty of insufficient labor. According to the engineering design, the benefit area of the reservoir not only exceeded the scope of the nineteen agricultural cooperatives in the Gao Ya area at that time but also exceeded the county boundary. The 5,000 laborers required for the project meant that Gao Ya needed to mobilize 800. Under the circumstances of agricultural cooperatives, it was very difficult to transfer so many laborers because each laborer in the entire district had to bear more than 27 mu of cultivated land on average. At the same time, a few people did not believe that they could block the Shixiakou, they said: "Such a big gorge, such a deep ditch, even the immortals have no way to do it, how can people build it." Originally, there was such a myth here: In ancient times, the two mountain peaks of Shixiakou were connected, and there was no gorge between the two mountains. Later, "Lord Lao" used his sword to cut open this gorge to open up a road from here. Later, when "Queen Mother" knew about it, she wanted to block the Shixiakou, so she used her skirt to fill it with soil to block it, but the result did not block it, and two skirts of soil became the Da Luo and Xiao Luo Mountains. In order to completely defeat the drought, the Hui and Han people of Gao Ya did not bow to any difficulties. They were determined to move mountains and create seas, block the canyon that the Queen Mother had not blocked, and order the flood to obey their commands. In the case of insufficient labor, 800 strong laborers were still transferred to the Shixiakou Reservoir project. Under the unified leadership and organization of the CPC Haiyuan County Committee, the entire district, townships, and cooperatives actively supported and united to launch a struggle to conquer the drought.

    Soon, Chairman Mao's "People's Communes are Good" and the Central Committee's "Resolution on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas" were published. The Gao Ya people immediately boiled over and joined the wave of the people's commune movement. The original nineteen agricultural cooperatives were built into the first people's commune in the county. As soon as the commune was established, it showed great superiority in the struggle to build water conservancy and conquer drought. The Gao Ya Commune, which benefited the most, could irrigate 50,000 mu, realizing water conservancy. At this point, the thousands of years of ideals of the vast Hui and Han people in the Gao Ya area were realized in one year after the establishment of the people's commune. They sang: "The people's commune has great power, realizing water conservancy in one year, turning dry beaches into Little Jiangnan, and a happy life for ten thousand years." The people who had doubts about the reservoir project also believed it, saying, "The people's commune is really better than the Queen Mother."

    This is Just the Beginning of a Happy Life

    The completion of this reservoir has played a huge role in agricultural production. In 1959, it suffered a drought of 120 days, but thanks to the reservoir, the land was irrigated, and agricultural production achieved a great harvest. Grassland has also been cultivated in the mountains, and each person already has an average of two sheep.

    The heroic feat of the Hui and Han members of the Gao Ya People's Commune in overcoming drought and realizing water conservancy is only the beginning of their construction of a happy life. Overcoming drought and realizing water conservancy has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the Hui and Han commune members. They firmly believe that man can conquer nature and man can transform nature. Therefore, they have already begun a larger-scale battle. The experience of Gao Ya has also promoted the mass movement of large-scale water conservancy construction in arid areas such as Guyuan, Haiyuan, and Tongxin. In more than a year, more than ten small reservoirs have been built, which has played a great role in changing the drought situation in these areas. We believe that under the guidance of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the Hui and Han people of Gao Ya will surely transform nature and create a happy life. What the Hui and Han people of Gao Ya have already done, the people of other arid areas in Ningxia will certainly be able to do.

    “风沙滩”变成“小江南”
    马豫真代表谈宁夏海原县高崖人民公社实现水利化的情况主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念、谭震林副总理的报告，决心在实际工作中贯彻执行。
    现在，我来谈谈宁夏回族自治区海原县高崖人民公社的回汉族社员战胜干旱，实现水利化的情况。
    海原县高崖人民公社，是一个回汉民族联社。全体回汉族社员，在党的总路线的照耀下，经过一年多的奋战，使这个“三水”（雨水、地面水和地下水）奇缺，风多雨少，十年九旱的“风沙滩”，变成了一个库水连天，渠道纵横，畦田密布的“小江南”。现在全社共有五万亩水地，每人平均占有四点五亩，实现了水利化。	泪比水多的历史
    “十年九载荒，穷人遭灾殃，半年糠菜饭，半年逃异乡，有家难团圆，家破人又亡”这是解放以前高崖人民痛苦生活的真实写照。过去在公社的西部，群山峻立，全是童山秃岭，没有一棵树，草也很少。一下雨山洪暴发，造成严重的水土流失。公社的东、南、北三面虽是平坦的高崖川，但却是“三水”奇缺：地面水除石峡口暴雨后排出的洪水以外，再无其他河流；地下水很深，且都是不能灌溉的苦水，年降雨量只有二百厘米左右，又多集中在8、9两个月。根据历史记载，从1927年到1949年的二十三年间就发生过二十次大小旱灾。
    解放前由于严重的干旱威胁，粮食的单位面积产量只有二十斤；收成最好的年份也不过四十斤。在大旱的年份，作物枯死，寸草不生，赤地千里。人、畜饮水要到三、四十里路以外的地方去驮运。没有牲畜驮水的农民，在缺雨季节，只得以高昂的价钱去买地主、富农、投机商的窖水。解放前，兴隆堡的水贩子，竟以一驮水一块白洋（相当于两斗粮食的价钱）的高价卖给农民，有时甚至两三块白洋还买不到。加上反动政府的压榨与剥削，贫苦的回汉族农民只好以“走为上策”，每逢旱年，贫苦农民携妻带子，出外逃荒。大旱的1929年，有8％的农户外逃。高崖村的三十七户人，除了留下六个老汉以外，全部外逃了。	千年理想，一年实现
    改变干旱，是高崖人民千百年来梦寐以求的理想。解放以后，在党和毛主席的领导下，英雄的高崖回汉族人民，同严重的干旱展开了顽强的斗争，并且不断的取得胜利。
    1958年春季，在党的建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，高崖的党组织和回汉人民一起，总结了历年兴修水利的经验，具体研究了高崖地区的自然特点，认为要改变高崖的干旱面貌，必须充分利用洪水，于是便决定在石峡口山谷修建一座水库，彻底改变高崖地区的干旱面貌。但是要修建这样巨大的水库，首先碰到了劳力不足的困难。根据工程设计，水库的受益面积，不仅超过了当时高崖地区十九个农业社的范围，而且超过了县界范围。工程所需要的五千个劳力，高崖就需要动员八百个。在农业社的情况下，要抽调这样多的劳力是很困难的。因为全区每个劳力平均要负担二十七亩多耕地。同时少数人不相信可以堵住石峡口，他们说：“那么大的峡口，那么深的沟，连神仙都没有办法，人还能修成。”原来，这里就流传着这样一个神话故事：在远古的时候，石峡口两个山头相连，两山之间没有峡谷口，后来“老君爷”为了从这里开辟一条道路，用剑斩开这条峡口。以后“王母娘娘”知道了，要把石峡口堵住，就用她的衣襟装上土去堵，但结果并没有堵住，倒下两衣襟土成了大小罗山。高崖回汉人民，为了彻底战胜干旱，并没有向任何困难低头，他们决心要移山造海，把王母娘娘没有堵住的峡谷堵起来，喝令洪水听从自己的调动。在劳力不足的情况下，仍然抽调了八百个精壮劳力投入到石峡口水库工程。在中共海原县委的统一领导和组织下，全区、乡、社争相支援，主动联合起来，展开了征服干旱的斗争。
    不久，毛主席的“人民公社好”和中央“关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议”公布了，高崖人民立即沸腾起来，卷入了人民公社化运动的浪潮，原来的十九个农业社建成了全县第一个人民公社。公社一成立，便在兴修水利、征服干旱的斗争中显示出巨大的优越性。收益最大的高崖公社，可灌溉五万亩，实现了水利化。至此，高崖地区广大回汉族人民千百年来的理想，在人民公社成立的一年中就变成了现实。他们歌唱到：“人民公社力量大，一年实现水利化，干滩变成小江南，幸福生活万万年”。原来对水库工程表示怀疑的人也信服了，说“人民公社真胜过王母娘娘”。	这只是幸福生活的开始
    这座水库的建成，对于农业生产发挥了巨大作用。1959年遭到了一百二十天的干旱，但由于有了水库，土地得到了灌溉，使农业生产获得了大丰收。在山地上还培育了草原，每人平均已经有了两只羊。
      高崖人民公社回汉族社员战胜干旱、实现水利化的壮举，只是他们建设幸福生活的开始。战胜干旱、实现水利化、大大鼓舞了回汉族社员的干劲，他们坚信人定可以胜天，人可以改造自然。因此，他们已经开始了更大规模的战斗。高崖的经验，还推动了固原、海原、同心等干旱地区大搞水利建设的群众运动，在一年多的时间内，兴修了十多座小型水库，对这些地区干旱面貌的改变，起了很大的作用。我们相信，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社化这三面红旗的引导下，高崖回汉人民一定会改造自然、创造幸福生活。高崖回汉人民已经办到的事，宁夏其他干旱地区的人民也一定能办到。
    以上发言，不妥之处请指正。
