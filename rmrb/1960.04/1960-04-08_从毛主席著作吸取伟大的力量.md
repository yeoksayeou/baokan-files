    Drawing Great Strength from the Works of Chairman Mao
    Liu Yiyun

    These past few days, we held the Liaoning Province on-the-spot conference of workers and peasants studying Chairman Mao's works. This was a conference where outstanding workers and peasants who persist in studying Chairman Mao's works spoke extensively about Mao Zedong Thought, dialectics, and the Party's theory of socialist construction. Over thirty people gave speeches, all of which were concise, profound, and lively. This was an exhibition of Mao Zedong Thought being sown, sprouting, blossoming, and bearing fruit among the broad masses of workers and peasants.

    To meet the urgent needs of the struggle for production and political struggle, to seek weapons, and to find the standpoint, viewpoints, and methods in Chairman Mao's works; to understand the world in order to transform it—this is a common characteristic of workers and peasants studying Chairman Mao's works. Some of them, during the bourgeois rightist offensive in 1957, watched as rightist elements launched a frenzied attack on the Party and the socialist system. They knew it was wrong, and their hearts burned with anger, but they couldn't theoretically refute some of the rightist rhetoric. On the front lines of the class struggle, they resented their lack of theoretical knowledge and deeply blamed themselves for not fulfilling the responsibilities of the working class. From then on, they began to study Chairman Mao's works diligently, persisting to this day, year after year. Others were newly promoted grassroots cadres who, in order to maintain the continuous great leap forward in production, encountered all sorts of complex problems: equipment, raw materials, technology, labor, advanced and backward thinking... Problems came in strings, difficulties piled up, and sometimes they were so busy that they couldn't eat or sleep, yet they still couldn't solve the issues. As they themselves said, "Poor analysis and research lead to wasted effort; there's only one path: to arm ourselves with theory." So they studied "On Contradiction." When they understood that contradiction is the driving force of the development of things and that in the face of complex contradictions, they must grasp the principal contradiction, they gained great strength and greatly liberated their thinking. They immediately changed from denying, avoiding, and fearing contradictions to not fearing, rejoicing in, and even mobilizing everyone to raise contradictions, analyze the principal contradictions, and organize everyone to create conditions to resolve the contradictions. As expected, difficulties were overcome one by one, problems that had not been solved for a long time were resolved, and new inventions and innovations continued to emerge. After learning that strategically they should despise difficulties, and tactically they should take difficulties seriously, they dared to march towards the technical revolution of mechanization and automation. They despised difficulties, so they were not afraid of failure; they took difficulties seriously, so they were prepared for countless failures, but they would not stop until they achieved their goals. Wang Feng'en, a national model worker, under the guidance of this great thought, has created more than two hundred and fifty technical innovations over the years, and recently, after four months of experiments and over a hundred failures, finally succeeded in automating the punch press. Wen Yucheng, a young worker at Anshan Iron and Steel, also under the guidance of the same thought, gained important new innovations in steelmaking technology after more than a hundred failures.

    Chairman Mao said in "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "We must all learn from his spirit of absolute selflessness. Starting from this point, one can become a person who is very beneficial to the people. A man's ability may be great or small, but if he has this spirit, he is a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who is free from vulgar interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people." These words have given countless workers and peasants a completely new mental outlook and established a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people. After accepting this thought, salespersons Li Suwen and Cheng Furun cared for the masses' lives in every possible way, investigated and understood the people's living needs, created various service methods that were convenient for the people's lives, transformed the stores into bases for supplying and improving the people's lives, and made the salespersons into propagandists of the Party's policies and social activists.

    These examples are too numerous to mention. We can already see that the advanced elements among workers and peasants, after learning a fundamental viewpoint from Chairman Mao's works, immediately learn and apply it, matching their words with their actions, and quickly grasping the revolutionary and creative spirit in Chairman Mao's thought. Applying it to their thinking, they quickly changed their mental outlook and achieved a great leap forward in thought; applying it to production, innovation and creation emerged one after another, bringing about a flying leap in production.

    Their spirit of overcoming all difficulties, studying diligently, and striving to read hard deeply moved people. Young worker Li Zhongbao lived in a collective dormitory for single people. When he studied the Selected Works of Mao Zedong late at night, he was afraid of affecting his comrades' sleep, so he moved to the side of the sink to study. Liang Jingzhi, the female captain of a rural production team, seized the time to rest while working in the fields and cooking at home and putting her children to sleep to persist in reading the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. They had various difficulties: low education level, not many characters known, and having to overcome three barriers—new characters, words and phrases, and theoretical concepts—when reading theoretical books; multiple concurrent jobs, with some people holding several positions at once, and many activities and meetings; strenuous physical labor, leaving them very tired after a day's work. But under these conditions, they used every possible opportunity—arriving early and leaving late, before and after meals, before and after meetings, while waiting at bus stops—to read, reading whenever they had time, squeezing in time when they didn't, taking advantage of every opportunity. They created the learning principles of "learn more when you're free, learn less when you're busy; be determined to persist, you must learn; a trickle becomes a stream, little by little accumulates, persist regularly, and make it a habit." They turned very little learning time into a lot, and regarded what ordinary people considered extraordinary learning methods as routine. A large number of people, through promoting this spirit of diligent study, spent several years reading Volumes One, Two, and Three of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, reading the important articles ten to twenty times or more.

    They are able to have such great revolutionary enthusiasm, such high enthusiasm, and such tenacious persistence in studying Chairman Mao's works because they are the advanced elements among workers and peasants. They say: "To make revolution, you must understand the principles of revolution," "A person's greatest happiness is to complete the tasks assigned by the Party; without studying theory, you cannot complete them," "To create inventions, high technology alone is not enough; you must have correct guiding thought." The working class's class nature and the Communist Party member's Party spirit radiate in them. Therefore, they most easily accept and understand the scientific works full of Party spirit and invincibility—Chairman Mao's works.

    从毛主席著作吸取伟大的力量
    刘异云
    这几天我们召开了辽宁省工农群众学习毛主席著作的现场会议，这是一个工人、农民坚持学习毛主席著作的优秀分子大讲毛泽东思想，大讲辩证法，大讲党的社会主义建设理论的会议。发表讲演的有三十余人，讲得都很简明、深刻、生动活泼。这是一次毛泽东思想在广大工人、农民中播种、萌芽、开花、结果的展览会。
    为了生产斗争和政治斗争的迫切需要，向毛主席著作中去找武器，去找立场、观点和方法；为了改造世界而认识世界，这是工人、农民学习毛主席著作的一个共同的特点。他们有的是在1957年资产阶级右派进攻时期，眼看着右派分子向党、向社会主义制度的猖狂进攻，明知不对，胸中怒火燃烧，但是要从理论上彻底驳倒有些右派言论，就是道理说不出来。在阶级斗争的火线上，他们痛恨自己缺乏理论知识，深责自己没有尽到工人阶级的责任，从此发奋钻研毛主席的著作，几年如一日，坚持到现在。有的是新提拔的基层干部，为了坚持生产持续大跃进，遇到了各种各样复杂的问题，设备上的，原材料上的，技术上的，劳动力的，先进和落后思想的，……问题成串，困难成堆，有时忙得要命，急得吃不下饭，睡不着觉，还是没有解决。正如他们自己所说：“分析研究差，苦恼也白搭，只有一条路，理论来武装”。于是学习“矛盾论”。当他们懂得了矛盾是事物发展的动力，在复杂的矛盾面前，要抓住主要矛盾这些道理后，他们就获得了伟大的力量，使思想大大解放。他们立刻由否认矛盾，躲避矛盾，害怕矛盾变为不怕矛盾，欢喜矛盾，并动员大家一起来提矛盾，分析主要矛盾，并且组织大家一起去创造条件，解决矛盾。果然困难一个个被克服，长期没有解决的问题得到解决，新的发明创造不断地出现。他们学到了在战略上要藐视困难，在战术上要重视困难这一思想以后，就敢于向机械化、自动化的技术革命进军。他们藐视困难，才不怕失败；他们重视困难，所以准备有无数次的失败，但不达目的决不终止。全国劳模王凤恩就是在这个伟大的思想指导之下，几年来创造了二百五十余项技术革新，最近又经过四个月的试验、一百余次的失败，最后使冲床自动化创造成功。鞍钢青年工人温玉成也是在同一思想指导下，经过百余次的失败在炼钢技术上获得重要的新创造。
    毛主席在“纪念白求恩”一文中说：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”这一番话，已经使得不知多少工人、农民的精神面貌焕然一新，树立了全心全意为人民服务的人生观。营业员李素文和程芙润，接受了这个思想以后，无微不至地关心群众生活，调查了解居民的生活需要，创造了各种各样便利于人民生活的服务方法，把商店变成为供应和改进居民生活的基地，使营业员成为党的政策的宣传员和社会活动家。
    这些事例，不胜枚举。我们已经可以看到：工人、农民中的先进分子，他们学了毛主席著作的一个根本观点，就立刻边学边用，言行一致，迅速抓住了毛主席思想中的革命创造精神。运用到思想上，就迅速改变了思想面貌，获得思想上的大跃进；运用到生产上，就出现了一个接着一个的革新创造，使生产上出现了飞跃的局面。
    他们那种排除万难，勤学苦钻，发奋读书的刻苦学习精神，深深地激动人心。青年工人李忠保，住独身集体宿舍，深夜看毛泽东选集，怕影响同志们睡眠，他就移到水池子边去学。农村生产大队女队长梁静枝，抓紧下地干活休息和在家里烧饭、哄小孩睡觉时间，坚持看毛泽东选集。他们有各种困难：文化低，识字不多，看理论书要过生字、词句和理论概念的三关；兼职多，有的一人身兼数职，活动多，会议多；紧张的体力劳动，干活一天，已很疲倦。就是在这种条件下面，他们利用早来晚走，饭前饭后，会前会后，乘车站队等一切可以利用的机会来读书，有空就读，没空就挤，见缝插针，无孔不入。他们创造了“闲时多学忙时少学，决心坚持，不能不学；细水长流，积少成多，坚持经常，养成习惯”的学习原则。他们把学习时间很少变为不少，把一般人看作非常的学习方法，当作学习的常规。有大批的人，就是发扬了这一种刻苦学习的精神，用几年的工夫，读完了毛泽东选集一、二、三卷，其中重要的文章，都读了十遍到二十遍以上。
    他们对学习毛主席著作所以能够有这样大的革命干劲，有这样高度的热情，有这样顽强的坚持性，就因为他们是工人和农民中的先进分子，他们说：“革命，就得懂革命的道理”，“一个人最大的幸福就是完成党交给的任务，不学理论就不能完成”，“要创造发明光是技术高不行，要有正确的指导思想”。工人阶级的阶级性，共产党员的党性，在他们身上放射着光芒。所以他们最容易接受和领会充满着党性的战无不胜的科学著作——毛主席的著作。
