Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 9th: People from all walks of life in Yunnan Province, numbering over two thousand, held a grand meeting on the 7th to welcome the overseas Chinese who have returned from Indonesia to settle in Yunnan.

　　The welcoming meeting was held at the Dongfeng Open-Air Theater in the Kunming Workers' Cultural Palace. When the more than 1,300 Indonesian returned overseas Chinese entered the venue, they were warmly welcomed by the assembly.

　　Liu Zhuofu, Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Vice Governor of Yunnan Province, and Director of the Provincial Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting, extending a warm welcome and sincere regards to the returned overseas Chinese. He pointed out that the Chinese government has always cherished the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples. Even in the face of large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese activities launched by powerful groups in Indonesia, the Chinese government still valued the friendship between the two countries and put forward three proposals for a comprehensive resolution of the overseas Chinese issue. In his reply to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio on March 15, Foreign Minister Chen Yi also suggested reaching an agreement on the repatriation of overseas Chinese as soon as possible. This once again demonstrates that the Chinese government is willing to resolve the overseas Chinese issue existing between the two countries through friendly consultations. We have reason to expect and demand that the Indonesian government fulfill its responsibilities and promises, prioritizing the friendship between the two peoples and the friendly relations between the two countries, immediately stop anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, and promptly consult with the Chinese government to reach an agreement on the repatriation of overseas Chinese.

　　Liu Zhuofu said: We warmly welcome overseas Chinese who are willing to return to the country to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. All returned overseas Chinese will have the opportunity to participate in work, labor, and study, and we will properly arrange their settlement based on national needs and individual wishes. He also expressed the hope that the overseas Chinese who have returned to Yunnan Province will continue to carry forward the fine traditions of loving the motherland and practicing diligence and thrift, unite with the people of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Party, and actively contribute to the socialist construction of the motherland.

　　Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Huang Buyun, a representative of veteran returned overseas Chinese, and Liao Shilong, a representative of returned overseas Chinese, also spoke at the meeting. Liao Shilong, on behalf of all returned overseas Chinese, expressed heartfelt thanks to the Party and the government for their deep concern, and condemned the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities launched by powerful groups in Indonesia, as well as the various persecutions and deliberate difficulties imposed on overseas Chinese. Liao Shilong concluded by saying that our great motherland cares for overseas Chinese in every possible way. The care the motherland gives us is even closer than that of our own relatives. He expressed that the returned overseas Chinese will actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland and strive to build their new and happy homes.

　　In the afternoon, Liu Zhuofu and other leaders of the provincial and municipal Party and government, responsible persons from the Provincial Reception and Settlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, the Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, the Kunming Municipal Office for the Reception of Returned Overseas Chinese, and other units, gathered with the returned overseas Chinese to have dinner together.

　　On the afternoon of the 3rd, Liu Zhuofu and other responsible persons went to the residences of the returned overseas Chinese to extend their cordial greetings.

    云南各界举行大会
    欢迎从印度尼西亚归国侨胞
    新华社昆明9日电　云南省各族各界人民二千多人7日举行大会，欢迎从印度尼西亚归国到云南安家的侨胞们。
    欢迎大会在昆明市工人文化宫东风露天剧场举行。当一千三百多名印度尼西亚归国侨胞进入会场的时候，受到了大会的热烈欢迎。
    中共云南省委书记处书记、云南省副省长、省接待和安置归国华侨委员会主任刘卓甫在会上致欢迎词，他向归国侨胞们表示热烈的欢迎和亲切的慰问。他指出，我国政府向来珍视中国人民和印度尼西亚人民的友谊，即使在印度尼西亚有势力集团大规模地掀起反华、排华活动的情况下，我国政府仍以两国友谊为重，提出了全面解决华侨问题的三项建议。陈毅外长在3月15日给印度尼西亚外长苏班德里约的复信中，又建议迅速达成遣送华侨的协议，这再一次表明我国政府愿意通过友好协商解决存在于两国之间的华侨问题。我们有理由期望和要求印度尼西亚政府履行它的责任和诺言，以两国人民的友谊和两国的友好关系为重，立即制止反华、排华活动，迅速与我国政府协商达成遣送华侨的协议。
    刘卓甫说：我们热烈欢迎愿意回国的华侨参加祖国的社会主义建设。凡是回来的侨胞都有参加工作、劳动和学习的机会，我们将根据国家需要和个人志愿妥善予以安置。他还希望回到云南省的侨胞继续发扬热爱祖国、勤俭节约的优良传统，在党的领导下，和各族人民团结一致，为祖国的社会主义建设事业积极贡献力量。
    省归国华侨联合会主席王昭明、老归侨代表黄步云和归国华侨代表廖世隆都在会上讲了话。廖世隆代表全体归国华侨衷心感谢党和政府的深切关怀；并且谴责了印度尼西亚有势力集团掀起的反华、排华活动，以及对华侨的种种迫害和刁难行为。廖世隆最后说，我们的伟大祖国无微不至地关怀着海外华侨，祖国对我们的照顾，真比亲人还亲。他表示归国侨胞将积极参加祖国的社会主义建设，努力建设好自己新的幸福家乡。
    下午，刘卓甫等省、市党和政府负责人，省接待和安置归国华侨委员会、省归国华侨联合会、昆明市接待归国华侨办公室等单位的负责人，同归国侨胞们欢聚一堂，共进晚餐。
    3日下午，刘卓甫等负责人曾到归侨居住的地方，向归侨们进行了亲切的慰问。
