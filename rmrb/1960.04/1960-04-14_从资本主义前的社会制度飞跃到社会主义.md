Fellow Representatives:

We fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

The people of various ethnic minorities in the Yunnan border region, like the people of all ethnic groups in the country, are advancing from victory to victory under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and under the brilliant light of the General Line. Looking back at the great changes of the past decade, especially the past two years, and looking forward to the bright and splendid future, we are inspired and full of confidence.

Yunnan is a province with many ethnic groups, with ethnic minorities accounting for about one-third of the province's total population. The socio-economic development of the various ethnic groups is extremely uneven, with different modes of production and at different stages of historical development. The socio-economic forms are intricate, complex, and varied, representing a living history of social development. Among the various ethnic groups, the Lisu, Jingpo, Kawa, Lahu, Benglong, Nu, Yao, Kucong, and other ethnic minorities or branches, numbering about 700,000 people, live in the remote mountainous areas. Due to various historical reasons, their socio-economic development is extremely slow, lagging behind other ethnic groups by several centuries. Moreover, the level of development of these ethnic groups varies. Some are still in an extremely primitive and backward state, not only without significant class differentiation and the concept of private property, but also unable to engage in agricultural production, relying solely on gathering and hunting to sustain their lives. They have no fixed residences, and some even do not wear clothes, using leaves for covering. Their level of production and life is not much better than that of our ancient ancestors who "lived in caves, ate raw meat and drank blood" as described in history textbooks. Except for individual ethnic groups who, due to external influences, believe in monotheism, most generally believe in polytheism, where "all things have spirits." Not only are wind, rain, thunder, and lightning mysterious and terrifying monsters, but birth, old age, sickness, and death are all controlled by gods. Moreover, strange mountains, unusual waters, ancient trees, and stubborn rocks are all incarnations of spirits or ghosts, becoming objects of blind worship and devout offerings. Therefore, it is an irrefutable truth that only by completely changing material living conditions and liberating ourselves from the slavery of the old system can we liberate ourselves from the slavery of nature. However, in the old era, this possibility simply did not exist. On the contrary, the long-term rule of successive feudal dynasties and the intrusion of imperialist forces, especially the brutal oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, forced the people of all ethnic groups to sink deeper into a state of extreme poverty, backwardness, and ignorance. It was not until the nationwide liberation, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the brilliant light of the Party's ethnic policy, that the various ethnic minorities were truly given the possibility of complete liberation from the slavery of the old system and the slavery of nature, creating a prosperous, happy, and progressive civilized life. Moreover, through the efforts and struggles of the people of all ethnic groups, this possibility has been or is being transformed into a glorious reality. As the Kucong people sing: "Everyone says the sun is very hot, but it cannot shine through the old forest and reach the Kucong people; only the sun of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can penetrate the ten-thousand-year-old forest and warm the hearts of the Kucong people." In this way, these backward ethnic minority people are all following the correct direction pointed out by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, breaking free from the shackles of the old system, and, together with the advanced ethnic groups, are vying to embark on the broad road of socialism. They are truly crossing one or even several stages of historical development at a pace of "one day equals twenty years," developing rapidly and gradually becoming advanced socialist ethnic groups. This is a great victory of the Party's ethnic policy, and a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with Chinese practice.

In the past few years, the people of various ethnic minorities in the Yunnan border region, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and under the direct leadership of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, have firmly moved forward along the road pointed out by Chairman Mao. Not only have ethnic relations undergone fundamental improvements, eliminating the historical phenomena of ethnic oppression and ethnic discrimination, and replacing them with new relationships of equality, unity, friendship, and mutual assistance; but the economic and cultural construction of various ethnic minorities has also developed significantly. Especially since 1958, due to the tremendous encouragement of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the people of various ethnic minorities in the border region are also full of energy and forging ahead courageously. They have taken a big step on the road of directly transitioning from the remnants of pre-capitalist primitive social systems to socialism, basically realizing cooperation, and in places where conditions permit, they have also experimented with people's communes. Profound and tremendous changes have taken place in all aspects.

Below, we will briefly cite examples of three ethnic groups at different levels of development to see the changes that have taken place in their direct transition:

The Kucong ethnic group mentioned earlier is in a more primitive and backward state compared to other ethnic groups. Class differentiation is not very obvious. Although they already know how to engage in agricultural production, they only use wooden hoes and wooden sticks, and the crops they grow are limited to corn and millet. They do not yet know how to grow rice, and their farming methods are very extensive. At most, the harvest of one year can only sustain three months of life. Therefore, they mainly rely on gathering and hunting for a living. In addition, before liberation, unable to withstand the brutal oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, they fled to the primeval forests of the Ailao Mountains, living an extremely miserable life. They wore tree leaves and animal skins, ate wild vegetables and herbs, and lived in sheds made of banana leaves that could not shelter them from wind and rain. For a long time before liberation, people rarely knew of the existence of the Kucong people, and no one cared about their whereabouts. It seemed that they had disappeared from the earth and from people's memories! It was not until after liberation that the light of the Party's ethnic policy shone on remote areas and deep mountains and forests, and the Kucong people gained new life. In 1953, the Jinping County Committee of the Honghe Autonomous Prefecture specially organized a Kucong ethnic group visiting group, carrying the Party and government's deep concern for the Kucong people and the production and living materials they urgently needed. They went deep into the primeval forest, endured many hardships, and finally found the Kucong people. They patiently explained the epoch-making changes in the motherland to them, publicized the Party's ethnic policy, and vigorously helped them move out of the deep mountains and forests and settle down. They established the Kucong people's village. The nearby Dai and Hani people helped them build houses, and Dai women sewed the first new clothes they had ever had. In addition to issuing a considerable amount of living supplies, the Party and government also issued plowing cattle, seeds, and a large number of agricultural tools, and sent people to help them learn how to use plowing cattle and agricultural tools, how to plow fields and transplant rice seedlings, and how to distinguish between barnyard grass and weeds, and even how to get haircuts and treat diseases. This meticulous care and vigorous help deeply moved and greatly encouraged the Kucong people, and their political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm rapidly increased. They gradually mastered agricultural production techniques, not only learning how to grow rice, but also how to grow economic crops such as cotton and sugarcane. Some even became production experts. In 1958, under the guidance of the General Line and the impetus of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, the Kucong people also mustered their revolutionary energy and threw themselves into the high tide of the Great Leap Forward. They said: "The ethnic groups more advanced than us are all working so actively, if we don't catch up, we will fall further behind. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao have pointed out the way, and we still have to rely on ourselves to walk." It was on this conscious ideological basis that they organized and established the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative, actively participating in the Great Smelting of Steel while building farmland water conservancy projects. Their farming techniques also greatly improved and enhanced. Even the Dai farmers unanimously reflected: "This cooperative is doing a really thorough job." In the past, they were not good at growing rice, but in this year, more than ten mu of rice created a record of 1,200 jin per mu, and the total grain output greatly increased compared to 1957, reaching more than 800 jin per person, catching up with the average level of the province. The trial planting of cotton also yielded a bumper harvest. In addition to selling more than 1,000 jin to the state, each cooperative member household received more than 20 jin. The cooperative established a small weaving factory, and the members all wore new clothes woven and sewn by themselves. In 1959, agricultural production achieved another continuous leap forward, becoming one of the advanced units in the province. Due to the rapid development of production, life is getting better day by day. Public canteens were set up, raising pigs and growing vegetables, and every meal had vegetables and oil. Schools were also set up, and young and middle-aged people all learned culture. Some have even been to Beijing. They enthusiastically sing: "We arrived at Tiananmen, the red flag of Tiananmen is flying, we saw Chairman Mao in the sea of people, and words cannot express the joy in our hearts. Chairman Mao leads, and his eyes look far, the Communist Party leads, and our hearts are broad."

From the above simple situation, it seems that the Kucong people have flown over thousands of years of human history and several stages of social development in less than ten short years, directly transitioning to socialism. The miserable days of suffering in the past are gone forever. But the Kucong people are not satisfied with this, and do not stop here. They say it well: "If other ethnic groups run, we have to fly. If other ethnic groups take the train, we have to take the plane. We can't catch up with the advanced ranks if we don't work harder." Facts have proven that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, these originally very primitive and backward ethnic groups are truly "flying without wings," traveling thousands of miles a day.

The Jingpo ethnic group, who live in the Dehong Autonomous Prefecture, has a higher level of social development than the Kucong ethnic group. The primitive commune has begun to disintegrate, but in some aspects, it still retains strong remnants of the primitive commune. The land is collectively owned, but the forms of collective ownership vary. Some are owned by the entire ethnic group, and some belong to the village. Eating is free. As long as you carry the Jingpo ethnic group's unique sign of a long knife and a bag, you can "eat in every village and every stockaded village." The phenomenon of class differentiation has already occurred, and in some places, this differentiation is becoming increasingly obvious. Those tribal leaders of the late primitive commune—mountain officials, headmen, etc.—have changed from their original position as mass leaders to rulers with considerable privileges, assigning labor and levies to their ethnic people, and are also subject to the influence of the Dai feudal system and other external factors, with a considerable degree of exploitation; however, they themselves often work alongside the masses and have the obligation to help and relieve people in their ethnic group who are in difficulty. It can be seen that the socio-economic form of this ethnic group is relatively complex. From the overall situation, the level of production is very low. People work hard all year round using slash-and-burn cultivation, unable to obtain enough food and clothing, and are in a very poor and backward state. Superstition is very deep. They believe that "all things have ghosts." Whenever they encounter disasters or diseases, they kill cattle and pigs to sacrifice to the ghosts, praying for the elimination of disasters and the relief of difficulties.

After liberation, the Party carried out a series of work in the Jingpo ethnic group area, vigorously helping them develop production. Based on the socio-economic characteristics of the Jingpo ethnic group, it was determined to rely on the poor working people, unite all patriotic upper-level mountain officials and headmen who are willing to make progress, and directly transition to socialism. During the transition, for some social factors and backward habits that hinder progress, necessary and appropriate reforms are carried out in a gentle manner based on the conscious actions of the ethnic people. After several years of efforts, the Jingpo ethnic group area has realized cooperation, and in places where conditions permit, it has already experimented with people's communes—the Santaishan People's Commune.

Santaishan is a famous mountainous area on the way from Mangshi to Wanting. It is a region where the Jingpo ethnic group is the main population, and there are also four ethnic groups including Benglong and Lisu. Before liberation, due to ethnic estrangement, the people of various ethnic groups, although "their chickens and dogs could hear each other," "did not interact with each other until they grew old," except for special circumstances that required contact. The climate here is mild, rainfall is abundant, the soil is fertile, the forests are dense, the shade is dense, and the pastures are lush, not only with pleasant scenery and poetic flavor, but also with superior conditions suitable for multiple operations. But in the past, the people of all ethnic groups living here lived an extremely painful life. Fundamental changes did not take place until after liberation. In 1956, based on the voluntary wishes of the various ethnic groups, twelve small agricultural production cooperatives were established. Over the past few years, agricultural and sideline production has developed greatly, repeatedly demonstrating the superiority of organization, thereby raising the socialist consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups. In 1958, due to the promotion of the Great Leap Forward wave and the needs of great production development, the people of all ethnic groups felt that "one brick cannot build a wall, one bamboo cannot build a bridge, and one small cooperative cannot build socialism," and strongly demanded that the strength of the various ethnic groups be further united. Thus, on the basis of the twelve small cooperatives, a joint people's commune of various ethnic groups was established on a trial basis, which more effectively accelerated the pace of direct transition to socialism.

The people of all ethnic groups in Santaishan went through a certain struggle in the process of cooperation and communization. There was not only a struggle between the advanced and the backward, but also a certain degree of class struggle. Some of those mountain officials and headmen ridiculed the masses, saying, "These poor bones have no plowing cattle, no plows, and no good land. Let's see them turn the land with their fingers!" Some even openly opposed and even sabotaged. But they could not stop the progress of the masses, and they became "negative teachers," promoting the improvement of the masses' awareness, and launched a rational struggle with them. For those law-abiding mountain officials and headmen, the method of unity and education was adopted. On the premise that they were willing to give up privileges and exploitation, they were absorbed into the cooperative to participate in labor production, giving them a new path. As for the laboring people within various ethnic groups, the establishment of the commune not only further consolidated ethnic unity, but also laid a solid foundation for jointly creating a happy life.

After communization, the revolutionary spirit of the people of all ethnic groups became greater, and their enthusiasm for labor became higher, promoting the great development of production, achieving continuous leaps forward, and fully demonstrating the superiority of the people's commune. In 1958, the total grain output increased by 55% compared to 1957, and in 1959, it increased by another 26% on this basis. They also made full use of favorable conditions to develop multiple operations, raising cattle, sheep, pigs, and chickens, planting coffee and tea, and holding several small processing industries, such as timber processing and dairy processing. These small factories may be insignificant from the perspective of advanced areas or advanced ethnic groups, but they are a groundbreaking event in the Jingpo ethnic group area. While production developed, cultural, educational, and health undertakings also developed greatly, and the people's spiritual outlook underwent profound changes. Superstitious thinking and backward habits were largely eliminated, and there were very few incidents of killing cattle to sacrifice to ghosts. The Jingpo ethnic group began to have their own accountants, teachers, and doctors. They established their own schools, and several young people have entered high schools and normal schools to study. The previously common malignant malaria, dysentery, and other diseases have also been basically eradicated. Liberated people must be both the masters of society and the masters of nature. This is truly an earth-shattering change for the backward ethnic minorities.

Compared with the above-mentioned Kucong or Jingpo ethnic groups, the backwardness of the social form of the Kawa ethnic group is roughly the same, but in a few areas, class differentiation is more significant. Some also have slaves, who can not only be arbitrarily exploited, but also have the power to kill or give away at will. Slaves can also be freely bought and sold as commodities. In some areas, due to the influence of the nearby Dai feudal system, feudal land exploitation also occurred. Farmers who rented land had to send gifts and pay a certain amount of physical objects to the land occupiers. Due to various historical reasons, the production and life of the Kawa people are still in a very backward state. The simplest tools made of wood, sheep bones, and animal bones are used, the farming techniques are very rough, and the production level is extremely low. The working people work hard all year round, but can only receive 100 to 200 jin of grain, living a semi-starved life. There is no accumulation at all, and there is a lack of the ability to reproduce. The Kawa ethnic group not only has the bad habit of killing people and cutting off cow tails to sacrifice to grain. During the reactionary rule, there were frequent armed conflicts between ethnic groups and between tribes of the same ethnic group, which often deepened the suffering of the Kawa people and caused the death of people's lives.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the Kawa people also experienced major changes. These changes can be seen roughly from the Henan People's Commune in Cangyuan Kawa Autonomous County.

Henan is a mountainous township inhabited by the Kawa ethnic group, with four villages and more than 340 households. Before liberation, it was a small tribe that retained a set of hereditary chieftain rule system. Although the natural conditions are very good, in the past, the Kawa people were subjected to heavy oppression and lived an extremely poor and painful life. After liberation, the Party and government vigorously helped the Kawa people to strengthen unity, production, and progress, and distributed a large number of materials and production loans, gradually fixed arable land, and improved farming techniques. Through peaceful consultations between the masses and the headmen, the headmen's privilege system was abolished, and production gradually developed. However, with the improvement of ideological awareness, the broad masses of the people increasingly felt that the individual economy could not fundamentally change the backward situation of the Kawa ethnic group, and urgently demanded to be organized. Therefore, after the high tide of cooperation in the inland, the Kawa people in Henan Township organized ten agricultural production cooperatives. In the spring of 1958, the spring breeze of the national Great Leap Forward blew into the Kawa Mountains, and the people of the whole township also mustered their energy and put forward a leap forward plan. Not only did they want to build farmland water conservancy projects, but they also wanted to build factories and power stations. However, everyone deeply felt that small cooperatives had few people and little strength, and it was very difficult to do these major things. They all asked the cadres: "Is there a better cooperative in the inland? If there is, we must do the same." In March, they could not wait to merge the ten small cooperatives into one large cooperative, and after the publication of the Party Central Committee's "Resolution on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas," it was renamed the Henan People's Commune.

After the establishment of the commune, the Kawa people, under the brilliant light of the General Line, more actively threw themselves into the high tide of the Great Leap Forward. They said: "Small cooperatives can only develop slowly. Although production has developed year after year in the past few years, the pace is too short. Now we have to take bigger steps." In one year, they newly opened up more than 1,680 mu of paddy fields, more than seven times the increase before liberation. A wasteland in the past has become "water ditches circling the mountains, and terraced fields covering the mountains." The habits of slash-and-burn cultivation, no irrigation, no fertilization, and crop rotation that the Kawa people have followed for generations have been changed. They also carried out deep plowing and close planting for the first time. All the paddy fields in the commune have been plowed and harrowed three times, deeply plowing to six to eight inches, and the most basic fertilizer applied per mu has reached 20,000 jin. In the past, the Kawa people only knew how to grow corn. After communization, they planted rice in large quantities and also tried to plant various economic crops of more than 900 mu. This is the first time that the Kawa people have promoted agricultural production to a more comprehensive development path.

After the establishment of the commune, with the support of the state, they also established more than ten factories of various sizes, such as sewing factories, rice mills, aromatic oil factories, wineries, and lime factories, as well as a relatively large iron and wood farm tool factory, ending the history of no industry. In the past, the Kawa people could not even use a saw, and a large piece of wood could only be split into two large wooden boards. In the past year or so, they have learned many techniques and can manufacture tools such as hoes, threshers, handcarts, weeding rakes, and threshing troughs. They have also established a power station, and every household has lit up electric lights. With the development of production, life has also been greatly improved. In 1958, the average grain per person reached 800 jin, and every household had quilts and blankets, completely getting rid of the miserable situation of being unable to cover their bodies and being unable to eat enough. The spiritual outlook has also undergone great changes. Fewer and fewer people believe in ghosts and gods, and the tragic phenomenon of killing people to sacrifice to grain has disappeared. As the Kawa people sing: "In the past, we sacrificed grain every year, but we could not eat enough or wear warm clothes every year; now, we get a bumper harvest without sacrificing grain, and we cannot forget Chairman Mao's kindness."

In the past, the Kawa ethnic group had no written language and knew nothing about culture. They relied entirely on wood carvings and objects to record and pass on events. In 1952, an elementary school was established for the first time. After the establishment of the commune, it developed to four schools, with 98% of school-age children enrolled. They also began to have their own middle school students. The old people said with emotion: "Our descendants will no longer be illiterate."

The changes and development of the Kucong, Jingpo, and Kawa ethnic groups mentioned above vividly demonstrate that Mao Zedong Thought and the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes also have unlimited power among the ethnic minority people in the border areas. It is precisely because of the firm reliance on this power that the people of various ethnic minorities in the border areas have taken a big step on the road of transition to socialism. But this is only "the first step in a long march." The road ahead is still very long, and long-term unremitting efforts are needed to completely change the poor and blank face.

1960 is the first year of the sixties and the third year of continuous leap forward in our great motherland. In this new era, the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas will certainly, together with the people of the whole country, raise the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and raise the three magic weapons even higher. Giving play to the spirit of continuous revolution, we will continue to move towards the great goal.

    从资本主义前的社会制度飞跃到社会主义
    雷春国（景颇）胡忠华（佧佤）魏崖景（佧佤）付一之（傈僳）李光华（拉祜）李开荣（瑶）代表裴阿欠（僳慄）胡玉堂（佧佤）高耀星（佧佤）委员的联合发言各位代表：
    我们完全同意国务院李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理的报告和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    云南边疆少数民族人民和全国各族人民一样，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下和总路线的光辉照耀下，从一个胜利走向一个胜利。回顾十年来特别是两年来的伟大变化，瞻望光辉灿烂的前景，令人精神焕发，信心百倍。
    云南是一个多民族的省份，少数民族约占全省总人口的三分之一，各民族的社会经济的发展极不平衡，具有不同的生产方式，处于不同的历史发展阶段，社会经济形态，错综复杂，参差不齐，是一部活的社会发展史。在各民族中，居住在边沿山区的傈僳、景颇、佧佤、拉祜、崩龙、怒、瑶、苦聪等约七十万人口的少数民族或民族支系，由于历史上的各种原因，社会经济的发展极为迟缓，比其他民族落后了几个世纪。而这些民族的发展水平又各不相同。有的还处在极端原始落后的状态，不仅没有很明显的阶级分化，没有私有财产的观念，而且不会搞农业生产，只靠采集和狩猎来维持生活，没有固定的居地，甚至不穿衣服，以树叶蔽体，其生产生活水平，和历史教科书上所说的“穴居野处，茹毛饮血”的我们远古祖先的情况好不了多少。除个别民族，因受外来的影响，信奉一神教外，一般信奉“万物皆有精灵”的多神教。不仅风、雨、雷、电，都是神秘可怕的怪物，生、老、病、死，都有神灵在主宰，而且奇山异水，古木顽石，都是精灵或鬼怪的化身，成了盲目膜拜和虔诚奉献的偶像。因此，只有彻底改变物质生活条件，从旧制度的奴役下解放出来，从而才有可能从大自然的奴役下解放出来，这是一条颠扑不破的道理。但在旧时代，这种可能性是根本不存在的。相反的，历代封建王朝的长期统治和帝国主义势力的侵入，特别是国民党反动派的残酷压迫，迫使各族人民日益陷入极端贫困、落后和愚昧的状态。直到全国解放，在毛泽东思想的指导下，在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，才真正给各少数民族从旧制度的奴役下和大自然的奴役下彻底解放出来，创造繁荣幸福和进步文明的生活，提供了巨大的可能性，而且经过各族人民的努力奋斗，这种可能性已经或正在变为光辉的现实。正如苦聪族人民所歌唱的：“人人都说太阳很热火，它却照不透老林，照不到苦聪人；只有共产党毛主席的太阳，才透过万年老林，温暖了苦聪人的心。”这样，这些落后的少数民族人民都遵循着党中央和毛主席所指引的正确方向，挣脱了旧制度的枷锁，同先进民族一起，争先恐后地走上了社会主义的康庄大道。真是以“一天等于二十年”的步伐跨过了一个以至几个历史发展阶段，迅速地向前发展，逐步成为社会主义的先进民族。这是党的民族政策的伟大胜利，是马克思列宁主义与中国实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    几年以来，云南边疆各少数民族人民，在毛主席、党中央的正确领导下，在中共云南省委的直接领导下，坚定地朝着毛主席所指引的道路前进，不仅民族关系有了根本的改善，消除了历史上遗留下来的民族压迫和民族歧视的现象，代之以平等、团结、友爱、互助的新关系；而且各少数民族的经济文化建设事业都有了显著的发展。特别是1958年以来，由于总路线、大跃进和人民公社三大法宝的巨大鼓舞，边疆各少数民族人民也是干劲冲天，奋勇前进。在从资本主义前的残存的原始社会制度向社会主义直接过渡的途程上跨出了一大步，基本上实现了合作化，有条件的地方，还试办了人民公社，各个方面都发生了深刻的巨大的变化。
    下面，我们略举三个处于不同发展水平的民族的事例，看一下他们在直接过渡当中所发生的变化情况：
    前面所提到的苦聪族，比起其他民族来，处于更为原始落后的状态。阶级分化不很明显。虽然已经懂得搞农业生产，但只会使用木锄、木棒，种的庄稼也仅限于包谷、地谷，还不会种稻谷，耕作方法非常粗放。一年收获，最多只能维持三个月的生活，因此，主要依靠采集和狩猎为生。加上在解放前，受不住国民党反动派的残酷压迫，逃到哀牢山的原始森林里，过着极其悲惨的生活。身上披的是树叶，是兽皮，吃的是山茅野菜，住的是不能避风避雨的芭蕉叶搭成的棚子。在解放前的长时间里，人们很少知道苦聪人的存在，也没有人关心他们的下落，似乎他们已经从地球上消失了，也从人们的记忆中消失了！直到解放以后，党的民族政策的光辉，照到了穷乡僻壤和深山老林，苦聪人才获得了新生。1953年红河自治州金平县委会特别组织了苦聪民族访问团，带着党和政府对苦聪人的深切关怀，带着他们所急需的生产生活资料，深入原始森林，经历了千辛万苦，终于找到了苦聪人，向他们耐心地讲解了祖国的划时代的变化，宣传了党的民族政策，大力帮助他们搬出深山老林，定居下来。建立了苦聪人的大寨。附近的傣族和哈尼族人民帮助他们盖了房子，傣族妇女给他们缝制了有生以来的第一套新衣。党和政府除发给他们相当数量的生活用品外，还发了耕牛、籽种和大批农具，并派人帮助他们学会使用耕牛和农具，学会犁田插秧，学会分清稗子和杂草。以至学会理发、治病等等。这种无微不至的关怀和大力帮助，使苦聪人受到了深刻的感动和极大的鼓舞，政治积极性和生产积极性迅速提高，逐步掌握了农业生产技术，不仅会种稻谷，而且会种棉花、甘蔗等经济作物，有的还成了生产上的能手。1958年，在总路线的指引和全国大跃进形势的推动下，苦聪人也鼓足了革命干劲，投入了大跃进的高潮中，他们说：“比我们先进的民族都这样积极苦干，我们再不赶上去就更要落后了。共产党毛主席指出了路，还要靠我们自己走。”就在这种自觉的思想基础上组织起来，建立了红光农业生产合作社，一面积极参加大炼钢铁，一面大修农田水利，耕作技术也有了很大的改进和提高。连傣族农民也一致反映：“这个社的工夫真做得周到。”过去，不善于种稻谷，但在这一年，有十多亩水稻创造了单产一千二百斤的纪录，粮食总产量比1957年有很大的增长，按人口平均计算，达到每人八百多斤，赶上了全省的平均水平。试种的棉花也获得丰产，除卖给国家一千多斤外，每户社员分得二十多斤，社里建立了小型织布厂，社员们都穿上了自己织缝的新衣。1959年，农业生产又获得连续跃进，成为全省先进单位之一。由于生产的飞跃发展，生活也一天天好起来，办起了公共食堂，养猪种菜，每餐有菜有油。并且办了学校，青壮年都学习了文化。有的还到过北京，他们热情地歌唱：“我们到了天安门，天安门红旗飘飘，人海里见到了毛主席，有嘴说不出心里的欢喜。毛主席领导，眼睛望得远，共产党领导，心里想得宽。”
    从上述简单情况看来，苦聪人在不到十年的短短时间内，已经飞越了人类历史的千百年代和好几个社会发展阶段，直接向社会主义过渡。过去那种苦难的悲惨的日子已经一去不复返了。但苦聪人并不因此满足，到此止步，他们说得好：“别的民族跑，我们就得飞，别的民族坐火车，我们就得坐飞机，不加劲是赶不上先进行列的。”事实证明：在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，这些原来非常原始落后的民族，真是“不翼而飞”，日行万里。
    聚居在德宏自治州的景颇族，其社会发展水平高于苦聪族，原始公社已经开始解体，但在若干方面还保持着浓厚的原始公社残余。土地是共有的，而共有的形式不一，有的归全族共有，有的属于村有。吃饭是不要钱的，只要带着景颇族特有标志的长刀和挂包，可以“逢村吃村，逢寨吃寨”。阶级分化的现象已经发生，而且有些地方，这种分化现象日趋明显。原始公社末期的那些部落酉长——山官、头人等，已由原来群众领袖的地位，变成有相当特权的统治者，向本族人民派工派款，而且受到傣族封建制度和其他外因的影响，有相当程度的剥削行为；但本人又往往和群众一道劳动，对于本族人民中有困难的人，还有帮助救济的义务。可见这个民族的社会经济形态是比较复杂的。从总的情况看，生产水平很低，刀耕火种，人民终年劳动，不得温饱，处于十分贫困落后的状态。迷信很深，认为“万物有鬼”，一遇到灾害或疾病，就杀牛宰猪祭鬼，祈求消灾解难。
    解放后，党在景颇族地区同样进行了一系列工作，大力帮助他们发展生产。并根据景颇族的社会经济特点，确定了依靠贫苦劳动人民，团结一切爱国的愿意进步的上层山官头人，直接向社会主义过渡。而在过渡当中，对于某些阻碍前进的社会因素和落后习惯，在本族人民自觉的基础上，采取和缓的方式，进行必要的适当的改革。经过几年来的努力，景颇族地区已经实现了合作化，并且在有条件的地方，已经试办了人民公社——三台山人民公社。
    三台山是从芒市到畹町途中的一个著名的山区，是以景颇为主，还有崩龙、傈僳等四种民族杂居的地区。解放前，由于民族隔阂，各民族人民之间，虽然“鸡犬相闻”，但除了特殊情况需要接触之外，“老死不相往来”。这里气候温和，雨量充沛，土地肥沃，森林成片，浓荫遮天，牧草茂盛，绿茵满地，不仅风景宜人，富有诗意，而且条件优越，适于多种经营。但在过去，居住在这里的各族人民，却过着极其苦痛的生活。解放以后，才发生了根本的变化。1956年，根据各民族的自愿，开始办了十二个小型的农业生产合作社。几年以来，农副业生产都有了很大的发展，一再显示了组织起来的优越性，从而提高了各族人民的社会主义觉悟。1958年，由于大跃进浪潮的推动，和生产大发展的需要，各族人民都感到“一块砖砌不成一堆墙，一根竹子搭不成一座桥，一个小社建不成社会主义”，强烈地要求把各民族的力量进一步联合起来，从而在十二个小社的基础上，试办了各民族联合的人民公社，这就更有效地加速了向社会主义直接过渡的步伐。
    三台山各族人民在合作化和公社化的过程中是经过一定的斗争的，不仅有先进与落后的斗争，而且有一定程度的阶级斗争。那些山官头人，有的讥笑群众说“这些穷骨头，没有耕牛，没有犁头，没有好地，看他们用手指头去翻地吧！”有的甚至公开反对以至破坏。但阻挡不了群众的前进，而且当了“反面教员”，促进了群众觉悟的提高，同他们开展了说理斗争。而对于那些守法的山官头人，则采取团结教育的办法，在他们愿意放弃特权剥削的前提下，吸收他们入社，参加劳动生产，给他们以新生的道路。至于各族劳动人民内部，由于公社的建立，不仅进一步巩固了民族团结，而且为共同创造幸福生活树立了牢固的基础。
    公社化以后，各族人民的革命干劲更大了，劳动热情更高了，推动了生产大发展，取得了连续跃进，充分显示了人民公社的优越性。1958年粮食总产量比1957年增长55％，1959年又在这个基础上增长26％。并且充分利用有利条件，开展多种经营，大养牛、羊、猪、鸡、种植咖啡、茶叶，并且举办了好几个小型加工工业，如木材加工，奶品加工等。这些小型工厂，从先进地区或先进民族的眼光来看，也许是微不足道的，但在景颇族地区却是一件破天荒的大事。在生产发展的同时，文教卫生事业也有了很大的发展，人们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。迷信思想和落后习惯大量消除，杀牛祭鬼的事已经寥寥无几。景颇族开始有了自己的会计、教师和医生，自己办了学校，有几个青年已进了高中和师范学校学习，过去经常流行的恶性疟疾、痢疾等病害也基本上根绝了。解放了的人民，既作了社会的主人，也必然要作自然的主人。这对于落后的少数民族来说，实在是天翻地复的变革。
    同上述的苦聪族或景颇族相比，佧佤族的社会形态的落后也大体差不多，但有少数地区阶级分化较为显著，有的还有奴隶，不仅可以任意剥削，而且有生杀予夺之权，也可以把奴隶当作商品自由买卖。在一部分地区，由于受到附近傣族封建制度的影响，也产生了封建的土地剥削，农民租种田地，要向土地占有者送礼物及缴纳一定数量的实物。由于历史上的各种原因，佧佤族人民的生产生活还停留在十分落后的状态。沿用着最简单的木头、羊骨、兽骨做的工具，耕作技术很粗糙，生产水平极低，劳动人民终年劳动，只能收到一、二百斤粮食，过着半饥饿的日子，根本谈不到积累，缺乏再生产的能力。佧佤族不仅有杀人头割牛尾祭谷的恶习。在反动统治时期，同其他民族之间以及本民族各部落之间，经常械斗，往往加深了佧佤族人民的痛苦，并造成了人民生命的死亡。
    解放后，在党的领导下，佧佤族人民也经历了重大的变化。从沧源佧佤族自治县贺南人民公社，可以概略地看出这种变化情况。
    贺南是一个佧佤族聚居的山区乡，有四个村寨，三百四十多户。解放前，是一个小部落，保留着一套头人世袭的统治制度。虽然自然条件很好，但在过去，佧佤族人民受着重重压迫，过着极端贫困和苦痛的生活。解放后，党和政府大力帮助佧佤族人民搞好团结，生产、进步，发放了大批的物资和生产贷款，逐步固定耕地，改进耕作技术。并通过群众和头人和平协商，废除了头人的特权制度，生产逐步得到发展。但广大群众随着思想觉悟的提高，日益感到个体经济不可能从根本上改变佧佤族的落后状况，迫切要求组织起来。因此，在内地合作化高潮之后，贺南乡佧佤族人民就组织了十个农业生产合作社。1958年春天，全国大跃进的春风吹进了佧佤山，全乡人民也鼓足了干劲，提出了跃进计划。不仅要大兴农田水利，而且要办工厂，建电站。但是，大家都深深感到小社人少力量小，要办这些大事是很困难的。都纷纷询问干部：“内地还有没有更好的社，要是有，我们一定照办。”3月间，他们就迫不及待地把十个小社合并成为一个大社，在党中央“关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议”发表后，便改名为贺南人民公社。
    公社成立后，佧佤族人民在总路线的光辉照耀下，更积极的投入了大跃进的高潮。他们说：“小社只能小发展，过去几年虽然生产连年都有发展，就是脚步太短，现在可要放大脚步了”。他们在一年内，就新开出了水田一千六百八十多亩，比解放前增加了七倍多。过去的一片荒山，变成了“水沟绕山转，梯田布满山”。佧佤族人民祖祖辈辈所沿袭下来的刀耕火种、不灌水、不施肥、耕地轮歇等习惯都改变了，还第一次进行了深耕密植，全社的稻田，都经过三犁三耙，深耕六至八寸，每亩施底肥最多的达到两万斤。过去，佧佤族人民只会种包谷，公社化后，才大量种植稻谷，并且试种各种经济作物九百多亩。这是佧佤族人民第一次把农业生产推向比较全面发展的道路。
    公社建立后，在国家的扶持下，他们还兴办了大小十多个工厂，如缝纫厂、碾米厂、芳香油厂、酿酒厂、石灰厂，还有规模比较大的铁木农具厂，结束了没有工业的历史。过去佧佤族人民连锯子都不会使用，一棵大木料也只能劈做两块大木板。一年多来，他们学会了许多技术，能够制造锄头、打谷机、手推车、薅秧耙、掼槽等工具，还建立了一个电站，家家户户都点上了电灯。随着生产的发展，生活也有了很大的改善，1958年，每人平均粮食达八百斤，家家户户都有了被子、棉毯，彻底摆脱了衣不蔽体，食不果腹的悲惨状况。精神面貌也起了很大变化。迷信鬼神的人一天天少了，杀人头祭谷子的惨酷现象已经绝迹了。正如佧佤族人民所歌唱的：“过去哟，我们年年祭谷子，年年吃不饱，穿不暖；如今哟，不祭谷子得丰收，毛主席的恩情不能忘。”
    过去佧佤族没有文字，更不懂得文化，记事传事全靠木刻和实物。1952年便破天荒地办起了一所小学，公社成立后，发展到四所，适龄儿童入学的占98％。并开始有了自己的中学生。老人们感慨的说：“我们的子孙后代再也不当睁眼瞎子了”。
    以上所举的苦聪族、景颇族、佧佤族的变化发展情况，生动地证明了毛泽东思想和总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝，就在边疆地区的少数民族人民中也具有无限的威力。正是由于紧紧地依靠了这种威力，边疆各少数民族人民已经在向社会主义过渡的道路上跨出了一大步。但是这仅仅是“万里长征走完了第一步”，前面的途程还长得很，还需要长期的不懈的努力，才能彻底改变一穷二白的面貌。
    1960年是六十年代的第一年，也是我们伟大祖国连续跃进的第三年，在这新的年代里，边疆地区的各族人民，一定和全国人民一道，更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，举起三大法宝。发挥不断革命的精神，向着伟大目标继续迈进。
