    New Stamps
    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications issued a set of two commemorative stamps on April 4th to "Celebrate the 15th Anniversary of the Liberation of Hungary."
    The first design features the national flags of China and Hungary, Tiananmen Square, and the Freedom Statue in Budapest, symbolizing the friendship and unity between the two countries. The second design features the Hungarian Parliament Building as its center, with red flags flying above it, indicating that the Hungarian working class, under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party, is bravely advancing towards a socialist society.
