Chairman, fellow members:

I fully endorse and agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, as well as Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and I am willing to return to my work post to resolutely implement them.

Here, as a commercial worker with practical experience in production, I would like to express some opinions on vegetable work.

**Vegetable Production Achieved a Great Harvest, Ensuring Market Supply**

Chongqing's vegetable work, like other tasks, has been under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, with continuous great leaps forward in the past two years, and in the rapid growth of the People's Communes. Under the unified leadership of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, we have vigorously promoted agricultural-commercial cooperation, actively implemented the Party's policies, and fully relied on the vast number of farmers in the suburbs to establish and consolidate vegetable bases, thus achieving a great harvest in 1959. Especially in 1959, when we suffered an unprecedented drought in decades, we achieved self-sufficiency, met the needs of urban and rural people, and ensured fodder for the great development of pig raising. This is undoubtedly a huge victory.

The fact that vegetable production, along with grain, achieved a great harvest, and ensured market supply even during the drought, has had extremely important practical significance in improving people's economic life, improving the quality of urban and rural public canteens, boosting the production enthusiasm of the working people, and providing favorable conditions for the collectivization of urban life. Due to the great harvest of vegetables, the communes increased their income, and the living standards of the members also improved. At the same time, it promoted the great development of animal husbandry, which played a great role in further strengthening and developing the People's Communes. Chongqing's vegetable work, under the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, has achieved remarkable results in the overall and continuous Great Leap Forward.

The achievements in vegetable work are mainly reflected in the following aspects:

First, a large increase in output, meeting the needs of all parties. In 1959, on the basis of completing 345,000 mu of vegetable bases, the total vegetable output reached 2.12 billion jin, an increase of 79.66% compared with 1958; the average yield per mu was 8,200 jin, an increase of 28% compared with 1958. The urban population ate more than one jin of vegetables per day, and the rural population ate about three jin per day; and the proportion of self-sufficiency increased from 72.73% in 1957 to 98.88% in 1959, reversing the past situation of relying on support from other places.

Second, stable prices, satisfying both producers and consumers. While ensuring market supply and meeting needs, we kept vegetable prices basically unchanged in the face of the drought, according to the Municipal Party Committee's instructions to continue stabilizing prices. We adopted the approach of slightly higher purchase prices than in the past and slightly lower retail prices than the previous year. As a result, the average purchase price in 1959 was 3.9 fen, an increase of 24.23% compared with 1957; the average retail price in 1959 was 5.29 fen, which was 1.5% lower than in 1958 and 51% lower than in 1957. Therefore, producers were satisfied, and consumers considered it a miracle.

Third, increased variety. The number of varieties increased from 176 in 1957 to 502, greatly increasing the production of vegetables that were previously not produced or produced in small quantities; at the same time, technical measures were implemented to stagger planting dates, making it possible to produce eighteen major varieties throughout the year. In particular, farmers created advanced methods such as tomatoes in spring, kohlrabi in summer, toon buds in autumn, and broad beans and peas in winter, enriching the content of the vegetable market and adapting to the growing needs of the people.

Fourth, early spring sowing and good management. The Municipal Party Committee attached great importance to vegetable spring sowing and called for grasping this work early, tightly, and well from the beginning of this year. Especially after the central government issued instructions on current vegetable work on February 18, it further boosted the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers in the suburbs and quickly set off a spring sowing upsurge. As of March 10, the area of vegetable spring sowing had reached 302,000 mu, of which 174,000 mu were planted with commercial vegetables, completing 78.9% of the plan; and 128,000 mu were planted with vegetables for farmers' own consumption, completing 101% of the plan. In addition, 160 million pumpkin seedlings were planted through mass movements. While spring sowing was underway, field management was strengthened, and soil preparation, transplanting, and fertilization were carried out simultaneously.

Vigorously developing vegetable production to meet the needs of the continuous leap forward in urban industrial production is an important task in vegetable work. The great progress in Chongqing's vegetable production reflects the spirit of the vast number of farmers in the suburbs in the overall Great Leap Forward, under the People's Commune system, and in the high tide of socialist production and construction; it also reflects the agricultural working people's enthusiasm for actively serving industrial cities and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. At the same time, it shows that various constructions on vegetable bases can be carried out vigorously, vegetable production can make extraordinarily great leaps forward, and the level of production management and production technology can be continuously improved. All of this shows the superiority of the People's Commune system. With it, we can overcome droughts, win harvests, meet the needs of urban and rural people for vegetables, and thus support industrial construction. It also reflects that it is a strong foundation for accelerating socialist construction. It is not difficult to imagine that without the People's Communes, we would not have achieved a harvest, let alone a great leap forward, under the drought that struck last year.

Like all other tasks, vegetable production, in the situation of the overall Great Leap Forward, convincingly demonstrates that this is the result of obtaining three magic weapons under the leadership of the great Party and Chairman Mao. Practical life proves that as long as we adhere to the General Line, adhere to the Great Leap Forward, and adhere to the People's Communes, we can overcome any difficulties and achieve great victories.

**"Vegetables as the Key in the Near Suburbs, Grain as the Key in the Far Suburbs, Grain, Vegetables, Meat, and Oil Simultaneously"**

The Chongqing Municipal Party Committee placed vegetable production in the near suburbs on an equal footing with grain, stipulating the principle of "vegetables as the key in the near suburbs, grain as the key in the far suburbs, grain, vegetables, meat, and oil simultaneously." This is an important step in the rapid development of vegetable production in our city. In order to implement this principle, we have done the following specific work in vegetable production:

(1) Comprehensive arrangement of production plans, focusing on key areas and grasping flagship varieties. We adopted: (1) Simultaneous emphasis on commercial vegetables and vegetables for farmers' own consumption, both actively arranging for commercial vegetables and vigorously urging the implementation of farmers' own consumption vegetable plans, achieving common harvests without delaying either. (2) Combining high mountains and plains, near suburbs and far suburbs. Using temperature differences, we promoted delayed spring sowing and delayed summer harvesting in mountainous areas; and advanced autumn sowing for early marketing, staggering sowing and harvesting times with the plains. For near-suburban areas, the focus was on arranging juicy melons, fruits, leafy vegetables, and small varieties; for far-suburban areas, the focus was on arranging root, stem vegetables that are resistant to storage and transportation. (3) Combining water-grown and drought-grown varieties, combining fresh and dried vegetables. Water-grown vegetables such as water spinach, celery, and watercress can all be high-yielding; drought-resistant varieties such as luffa, white eggplant, amaranth, and vegetable melons are also not low in yield. These water-and drought-grown vegetables play a significant role in the off-season of August and September, and we have made arrangements for large-scale planting. While actively expanding the variety of fresh vegetables, we have also prepared for processing equipment. In terms of dried vegetable production, our city has successfully cultivated fungus, which should continue to be developed along with shiitake mushrooms and straw mushrooms. Other items such as cassava, daylilies, and Sichuan peppercorns are also arranged simultaneously, especially the development of pickled mustard greens is a key focus. (4) Combining large, medium, and small varieties, and focusing on flagship varieties. On the basis of meeting the needs of urban and rural people for vegetable quantities, we further expanded the variety, especially for small and medium-sized varieties, adopting "dedicated land arrangement, specialized production." For flagship varieties, we adopted a combination of planned arrangements and mobilizing mass movements, such as the spring-sown pumpkins and autumn-sown radishes, which mobilized the masses to plant in large quantities.

(2) Taking technological innovation and technological revolution as the center, continuing to implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and strengthening the construction of vegetable bases. The Guangming Brigade (vegetable specialized team) of the Huaxi Commune in Jiulongpo District, under the leadership and support of the district party committee, has achieved farmland gardening, semi-mechanization of farming tools, gravity flow fertilization and irrigation, mechanical watering and rainfall, and vehicle and boat transportation, greatly reducing the labor intensity of vegetable production. The team has saved more than 300 laborers. In terms of gardening, the Zhongba Farm in Ba County has achieved "rows horizontally and vertically, diagonal views like fishing nets, and straight views like beehives." The work of gardening construction in vegetable bases throughout the city is being further combined with the increase production and practice economy movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution; at the same time, the development of the movement first goes from tool improvement to semi-mechanization and mechanization to accelerate the construction of rural modernization.

While actively promoting technological innovation and technological revolution, we continue to implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." In the specific situation of the suburbs of Chongqing, we focus on solving the four aspects of water, fertilizer, seeds, and management.

Due to the lessons of last year's extraordinary drought, 64 pumping stations and 89 pumps, totaling 3,835 horsepower, have been built on the vegetable bases of the five near-suburban districts, with an annual water storage capacity of 27.28 million cubic meters, which can irrigate 77,955 mu of vegetable land. This year, 90% of the water conservancy projects will be completed, ensuring that each mu of vegetable land has 400 to 500 tons of water sources. In terms of fertilizer, the average fertilizer application per mu of vegetable land in 1959 was 20,000 jin, and this year's plan is 30,000 jin. With the vigorous development of pig raising in the city, fertilizer is reliably guaranteed. In terms of vegetable seeds, we will continue to implement the "Four Selfs" (self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, self-use) principle. Under the premise of ensuring quality, we require that three to five sets of seeds for regular planting, increased planting, emergency preparedness, and regulation be retained, so as to achieve self-sufficiency and not panic in the face of drought. In terms of field management, we adopt a combination of regular professional management and concentrated management to meet the requirements of the strong seasonality and meticulous management of vegetables.

In the case of the extraordinary leap forward in vegetable production in 1959, with an increase of nearly one-fold, the vast number of farmers combined the vigorous construction of vegetable bases, the reform movement of production technology, and the good application of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." This ensures the continuous and greater leap forward in vegetable production.

(3) Adopting comprehensive measures to achieve strong people, fat pigs, and thriving livestock. Vegetables are not only necessary for urban and rural people, but also related to the development of animal husbandry; conversely, the development of animal husbandry provides a large amount of fertilizer for vegetable and grain production, which are mutually dependent and mutually promoting. Therefore, when arranging vegetable production, we must not only consider the needs of urban and rural people, but also the needs of livestock development. We have adopted comprehensive measures to ensure that people have rich dishes and pigs have abundant feed. The specific methods are: (1) Advance seedling cultivation: According to natural conditions, fully utilize the experience of old farmers and mature methods, implement winter sowing and spring transplanting, and implement a system of designated plots and responsibility to the field, so as to ensure that the seedlings are complete and strong, and ensure that the vegetables mature and are marketed early. This past winter and spring, 15,812 seedling cultivation facilities such as solar greenhouses, fire kilns, and soil warm beds have been widely used, sowing 160,000 jin of seeds, making spring sowing earlier, which is greatly beneficial to the early emergence and marketing of summer vegetables. (2) Continue to promote advanced cultivation systems such as intercropping grain with vegetables, intercropping vegetables with grain, surrounding grain with vegetables, and surrounding vegetables with grain. This is an experience explored by our city in the face of the extraordinary drought last autumn, and it is also a creation of the vast number of farmers in our city to specifically implement the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction. It is based on the principle of intercropping vegetable land with grain, with vegetables as the main focus; and intercropping grain land with vegetables, with grain as the main focus, to achieve double harvests of grain and vegetables. Last autumn, vegetables were intercropped on 760,000 mu of the 1.7 million mu of grain fields, greatly meeting the needs of the people for vegetables and supporting a large amount of pig feed. This year, more than 800,000 mu of spring-sown grain fields have been arranged for intercropping with pumpkins, and more than 500,000 mu of autumn-sown fields have been arranged for radishes. (3) Widely mobilize factories, schools, groups, and residents to grow vegetables. The principle of "walking on two legs" is also implemented on the vegetable front. There are 2,178 social vegetable-growing units in the city, with a planting area of 24,711 mu, accounting for 11.3% of the commercial vegetable base area. From September of last year to February of this year, 80 million jin of vegetables were produced, accounting for 22% of the city's commercial volume during the same period, and has become an important supplementary force for commercial vegetables. (4) Actively care about pig feed, open up feed sources in many ways, plant large quantities of water hyacinth, "revolution grass," and "dragon claw beans," and explore wild feed sources, reduce vegetable consumption, and increase the reserve strength of dried and salted vegetables.

**Resolutely Implement the Principle of "Self-Reliance as the Mainstay, Striving for External Assistance as a Supplement" for Developing Non-Staple Food Production**

The commercial department, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, resolutely implemented the principle of "self-reliance as the mainstay, striving for external assistance as a supplement" for developing non-staple food production, and practice has proven that it is completely correct. While vigorously promoting agricultural-commercial cooperation and actively participating in production, we have done the following specific work on vegetable supply:

(1) Reducing operating links, direct allocation, and widely promoting direct producer-consumer meetings. According to the principle of local production and local supply, collective units such as factories and mines, and regional store operating units, are organized to directly meet and link up with People's Communes, connecting production and needs plans and signing contracts. Through these meetings, producers are encouraged to care about needs, and consumers are encouraged to care about production, so as to support each other and jointly build bases, achieving the satisfaction of both producers and consumers. This is not only a close economic connection, but also has communist style, further strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, and has great political significance.

(2) Setting up points in all areas, purchasing on site, and taking responsibility for purchasing, selling, and transportation. In order to ensure that production plans are implemented, promote the rapid development of vegetable production, and be able to adjust varieties and quantities in a timely manner, the commercial department has set up purchasing points in various vegetable brigades, implementing a complete set of methods such as on-site purchase, payment, acceptance, distribution, and transportation, so that the vegetables that are produced are processed in the shortest possible time and reach the market or consumers in a timely manner.

(3) Improving market distribution work. Due to the widespread establishment of public canteens, the individual purchases of more than one million consumers in the past have been changed to large-scale purchases by collective units today, and the vegetable distribution work must be changed accordingly. We adopted the method of establishing several vegetable cadres (known as vegetable registration) based on the original market, dividing areas and contracting them, lining up and taking stock, investigating to the canteen (dining hall), and going deep into households to conduct full understanding. Because the Party is constantly concerned about the lives of the masses, calling on everyone to start from production, actively organize the economic life of the people, and organize the rational distribution of commodities, so as to achieve the collectivization of production and life, thereby improving the socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the people. Therefore, our distribution principle is: ensure industry and mining, focus on collectives, and appropriately take care of individuals.

**Strengthening the Leadership of the Municipal Party Committee over Vegetable Work, Adhering to Putting Politics in Command, is the Fundamental Reason for Achieving Success**

Chongqing's vegetable production and sales work, under the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, with the full reliance of both agriculture and commerce on the vast number of farmers and commercial workers, has done a lot of work, overcome various difficulties, and achieved great success. The most fundamental reason for achieving success is that the Municipal Party Committee has strengthened its leadership over vegetable work, adhered to putting politics in command, and resolutely implemented the Party's policies, which has promoted production development, changed the face of vegetable work, and thus ensured the needs of urban and rural people's lives. Vegetable work is a specific task in agricultural production and commodity supply, but it is inseparable from the situation of continuous great leaps forward. Therefore, the achievements of vegetable work are also a great victory for the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. Another reason is that, under the leadership of the Party, the mass line has been implemented, mass movements have been carried out, and vegetable production and sales work has been carried out around the Party's central tasks, such as base construction, autumn planting and spring sowing, especially in last year's drought resistance and seedling protection, the heroic slogan of "People are there with the seedlings are there," "Rather carry dry river water than let a nest of vegetables die" was put forward, and a tenacious struggle was carried out against the severe drought, and victory over the drought and a harvest were won. Another reason is that, under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, agricultural and commercial cooperation has been carried out vigorously, and agricultural and commercial parties have been twisted into one rope. Under the premise of unified understanding and unified steps, the commercial department has transferred more than 1,000 people, organized 51 working groups, went deep into the communes to assist in production planning, organize production, and jointly solve difficulties, which has strongly promoted the great development of vegetable production.

Although Chongqing's vegetable work has made the above achievements under the leadership of the Party, there is no reason for us to be proud or complacent. Moreover, we cannot completely avoid the threat of natural disasters in production, which requires us to grasp every month, every season, every year, and everything, and not relax our vigilance in the slightest.

1960 is the first year of the 1960s. With technological innovation and technological revolution as the center, further carrying out large-scale movements to increase production and practice economy will surely promote greater and continuous leap forwards in industrial and agricultural production. In particular, urban People's Communes are being established rapidly, which requires commercial work to vigorously "develop the economy and ensure supply" and make greater achievements in building socialism at high speed. According to past experience, as long as we resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party committee, have the guiding light of the General Line, the victorious foundation of the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, coupled with the excellent situation of further consolidating and developing the People's Communes, we must redouble our efforts, work actively, and make greater leap forwards and greater victories in vegetable work under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 满足人民需要做好蔬菜工作  刘昆水委员的发言

专栏：

    满足人民需要做好蔬菜工作
    刘昆水委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护和同意李富春、李先念和谭震林副总理及陈叔通副主席的报告，并愿带回工作岗位坚决地贯彻执行。
    在这里，我作为一个商业工作者，以参与生产的实际体会，对蔬菜工作发表一些意见。
    蔬菜生产夺得大丰收，保证了市场供应
    重庆市蔬菜工作，与其他各项工作一样，是在党的总路线光辉照耀下，两年来持续的大跃进，以及人民公社的迅速成长中，在重庆市委统一领导下，大搞农商协作，积极贯彻执行党的方针政策，充分地依靠郊区广大农民，建立和巩固了蔬菜基地，因而获得了1959年的大丰收。特别是在1959年遭受了几十年来未有的干旱情况下，做到了自给，满足了城乡人民需要，保证了生猪大发展的饲料，无疑是一个巨大的胜利。
    蔬菜生产与粮食一道夺得大丰收，即在干旱时期也保证了市场供应，这对改善人民经济生活，提高城乡公共食堂质量，鼓舞劳动人民生产热情，并为城市生活集体化提供了有利条件，具有极为重大的现实意义。由于蔬菜生产大丰收，公社增加了收入，社员生活水平也有了提高，同时促进了畜牧业的大发展，这对进一步健全和发展人民公社，起到了极大的作用。重庆市的蔬菜工作，在市委直接领导下，在全面的、连续的大跃进中，获得了显著的成绩。
    蔬菜工作上的成绩，主要表现在下列几点：
    首先是产量大增，满足各方需要。1959年在完成了蔬菜基地三十四万五千亩的基础上，蔬菜总产量达到二十一亿二千万斤，较1958年增长79.66％；单位面积产量平均每亩为八千二百斤，比1958年增长28％。城市人口每天吃菜在一斤以上，农村人口每天吃菜在三斤左右；并且自给比重由1957年的72.73％上升到1959年的98.88％，扭转了过去依靠外地支援的局面。
    第二是价格稳定，产消双方满意。在保证市场供应，满足需要的同时，在蔬菜价格上，根据市委继续稳定物价的指示，在干旱的情况下，做到基本不变。我们采取收购价略高于过去，零售价略低于上年，执行结果，1959年的平均收购价格为三点九分，比1957年增加24.23％；1959年的平均零售价格为五点二九分，比1958年低1.5％，比1957年低51％，因而使生产者满意，消费者认为奇迹。
    第三是增加花色品种。由1957年的一百七十六个，增加为五百零二个，大大增加了过去不生产或少生产的蔬菜；同时实行提前延后，排开播种的技术措施，使十八个主要品种基本做到全年生产。特别是农民们创造了春有番茄，夏出苤兰，秋采椿芽，冬吃豆菜（蚕豆和豌豆）等先进办法，丰富了菜市场的内容，适应人民日益增长的需要。
    第四是春播得早，管理得好。市委十分重视蔬菜春播，今年一开始就号召抓早、抓紧、抓好这一工作。特别在2月18日中央对当前蔬菜工作作出指示以后，更鼓舞了郊区广大农民的生产热情，迅速掀起了春播高潮。截至3月10日止，蔬菜春播面积已达到三十万二千亩，其中商品菜地已播种十七万四千亩，完成计划78.9％；农民自食菜地已播种十二万八千亩，完成计划101％。此外还通过群众运动，播种了南瓜一亿六千万窝。在春播的同时，加强了田间管理，做到了翻土、移栽、施肥一道清。
    大力发展蔬菜生产，以适应城市工业生产持续跃进的需要，这是蔬菜工作上的一项重要任务。重庆市蔬菜生产长足进展，它正反映了郊区的广大农民，在全面大跃进中，在人民公社制度下，在社会主义生产建设的高潮里的精神面貌；也反映了农业劳动人民积极地为工业城市服务，密切工农联盟的政治热情。同时也说明：蔬菜基地上各项建设能够大力进行，蔬菜生产能够特大跃进，生产管理、生产技术水平能够不断提高，所有这一切都显示了人民公社制度的优越性。有了它，就能战胜干旱，夺取丰收，满足城乡人民吃菜需要，从而支援了工业建设，也就反映了它是加速社会主义建设强有力的基础。不难想像，如果没有人民公社，在去年这样干旱侵袭下，不会获得丰收，更谈不上大跃进了。
    蔬菜生产和各项工作一样，在全面大跃进的形势下，使人信服地懂得，这是在伟大的党和毛主席领导下，获得了三个法宝的结果。实际生活证明，凡是坚持总路线，坚持大跃进，坚持人民公社，就能战胜任何困难，取得巨大胜利。
    近郊以菜为纲，远郊以粮为纲，粮菜肉油同时并举
    重庆市委把近郊蔬菜生产放在粮食的同等地位，规定“近郊以菜为纲，远郊以粮为纲，
  粮菜肉油同时并举”的方针，这是我市蔬菜生
  产迅速发展的重要步骤。为了贯彻执行这一方针，我们在蔬菜生产上作了下面的一些具体工作：
      （一）生产计划全面安排，突击重点大抓挂帅品种。我们采取：（1）商品蔬菜与农民自食蔬菜同时并举，既要积极安排商品蔬菜，又要大力督促农民自食蔬菜计划落实，做到共同丰收两不耽误。（2）高山与平地、近郊与远郊相结合。利用气温差别，在山地推行春播延后，夏收推迟；秋播提前，抢早上市，与平地播种和收获时间叉开。对于近郊地区以安排多汁的瓜果叶菜及细小品种为主；对远郊地区以安排耐储耐运的根块和茎菜为主。（3）水长旱生、干鲜并举。水中生长的藤菜（空心菜）、芹菜、西洋菜等都能高产；耐旱的丝瓜、白茄子、苋菜、菜瓜等产量也不低，这些水旱生的蔬菜对8、9月淡季都起很大作用，我们作了大量播种的安排。在积极扩大花色品种发展鲜菜的同时，并进行了加工设备的准备工作。在干菜生产方面，我市培植木耳已经成功，应与香菇、草菇继续发展。其他像木芋、黄花、蔊椒等同时安排，特别对榨菜作了重点发展。（4）大中小品种并举，大抓挂帅品种。在满足城乡人民吃菜数量的基础上，进一步扩大花色品种，尤其对中小品种，采取“专地安排，专业生产”。在挂帅品种上，采取计划安排与发动群众运动相结合的办法，像春播的南瓜、秋播的萝卜，就发动群众大量种植。
      （二）以技术革新和技术革命为中心，继续贯彻农业八字宪法，加强蔬菜基地的建设。九龙坡区花溪公社光明大队（蔬菜专业队）在区委的领导和支持下，已经实现了耕地园田化，耕作工具半机械化，肥料灌溉自流化，浇菜降雨机械化，运输车船化，使蔬菜生产劳动强度大大减少，全队就节约劳动力三百多人。在园田化方面，巴县的中坝农场，做到了“横看横成行，纵看纵成厢，斜看赛鱼网，正看如蜂房”。全市蔬菜基地的园田化建设工作，正以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动进一步开展结合起来；同时运动的发展，先从工具改良走向半机械化、机械化，以加速农村四化的建设。
    在积极推动技术革新和技术革命的同时，继续贯彻农业八字宪法。在重庆市郊区的具体情况下，着重解决水、肥、种、管等四方面。
  由于去年特大干旱的教训，在近郊五个区的蔬菜基地上，已经建设了抽水站六十四个，抽水机八十九台，共计三千八百三十五马力，全年蓄水可达二千七百二十八万立方米。可灌溉菜地七万七千九百五十五亩。今年将完成90％的水利工程，保证每亩菜地有四百至五百吨的水源。在肥料方面，1959年平均每亩菜地施肥为两万斤，今年规划为三万斤，全市在大力发展生猪的情况下，肥料是有可靠的保证。在蔬菜种籽方面，仍将继续贯彻“四自”（自繁、自选、自留、自用）方针，在保证质量的前提下，要求正种、增种、备荒和调剂等种籽留足三至五套，做到自给有余，遇旱不慌。在田间管理方面，我们采取经常的专业管理和突击管理相结合，以适应蔬菜季节性强和管理细致的要求。
    在1959年蔬菜生产增长近一倍的特大跃进情况下，广大农民把蔬菜基地的大力建设，生产技术的改革运动和农业八字宪法的良好运用这三者结合起来，这就保证了蔬菜生产不断地更大跃进。
      （三）采取综合措施，做到人强猪肥，六畜兴旺。蔬菜不仅是城乡人民所必需，它也关系着畜牧业的发展；反过来说，畜牧业的发展，又为蔬菜和粮食增产提供了大量肥料，这是互相依靠、互相促进。所以我们在安排蔬菜生产时，既要考虑城乡人民的需要，也要考虑牲畜发展的需要。我们采取了综合措施，做到人有丰富菜肴，猪有大量饲料。具体的做法是：（1）提前育苗：根据自然条件，充分利用老农经验和成熟方法，实行冬季播种，见春移苗，并实行划片定块，责任到田制度，做到苗全苗壮，保证蔬菜早熟上市。去冬今春，普遍采用阳畦、火窑子、土温床等育苗设备一万五千八百一十二个，下种十六万斤，使春播提前，大大有利夏菜的提早出土上市。（2）继续推广以粮套菜，以菜套粮，以菜围粮，以粮围菜等先进栽培制度。这是我市在去秋特大干旱下摸索出来的一条经验，也是我市广大农民群众具体贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的一个创举。它是以菜地套粮，以菜为主；粮地套菜，以粮为主的原则下，做到粮菜双丰收。去年晚秋一百七十万亩粮田中，套种间种蔬菜七十六万亩，大大满足了人民的吃菜需要，并支援了大量的生猪饲料。今年安排春播粮地中套种南瓜八十多万亩，秋播安排了萝卜五十多万亩。（3）广泛发动工厂、学校、团体以及居民等大家种菜。在蔬菜战线上同样贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针。全市社会种菜单位有二千一百七十八个，种植面积达二万四千七百一十一亩，占商品菜基地面积的11.3％，自去年9月到今年2月出产蔬菜八千万斤，占全市同期商品量的22％，已经成为商品蔬菜的重要补充力量。（4）积极关心生猪饲料，多方开辟饲料来源，大种水浮莲、革命草、龙爪豆等，并发掘野生饲料来源，减少蔬菜消耗，增加干咸菜储备力量。
    坚决贯彻“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的发展副食品生产方针
    商业部门全体职工，在市委的领导下，坚决贯彻执行“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的发展副食品生产的方针，实践证明是完全正确的。我们在大搞农商协作、积极参与生产的同时，对蔬菜供应上做了下面一些具体工作：
      （一）减少经营环节，直接调拨，广泛推动产销见面。根据就地生产就地供应的原则，组织厂矿等集体单位，和地区商店经营单位，同人民公社实行产消（销）直接见面挂钩，衔接生产和需要计划，签订合同。通过见面，促进了生产者关心需要，消费者关心生产，做到互相支援，共同建设基地，获得了产、消（销）双方大家满意。这不仅是经济上的紧密联系，而且是具有共产主义风格，进一步加强了工农联盟的重大政治意义。
      （二）全面设点，收购到地，购销调运一竿到底。商业部门为了使生产计划具体落实，促使蔬菜生产迅速发展，并能及时调剂品种数量，就在各个蔬菜大队中，设置了收购点，实行就地收购、付款、验收、分配、和调运等一整套办法，使出土的蔬菜，在最短时间内进行处理，及时到达市场或消费者手中。
    （三）改进市场分配工作。由于公共食堂的普遍建立，过去百万多户消费者的个别购用，到今天改变为集体单位大量采购的新情况，蔬菜分配工作必须相应改变。我们采取以原有市场为基地，设立若干蔬菜干事（群众称为菜户籍）按一定地段，划片包干，排队摸底，调查到堂（食堂），深入到户，进行充分了解。由于党不断关心群众生活，号召大家从生产着手，积极组织人民经济生活，组织商品合理分配，达到生产、生活集体化，从而提高人民群众的社会主义觉悟和劳动热情。因此，我们的分配原则是：保证工矿、侧重集体、并适当照顾个人。
    市委加强对蔬菜工作的领导，坚持政治挂帅，是获得成绩的根本原因
    重庆市蔬菜产销工作，在市委直接领导下，农商双方，全面地依靠广大农民和商业职工，做了不少工作，克服了各种困难，获得了巨大成绩。获得成绩的最根本原因是：市委加强了对蔬菜工作的领导，坚持了政治挂帅，坚决贯彻了党的方针政策，这就促进生产发展，改变了蔬菜工作的面貌，从而保证了城乡人民的生活需要。蔬菜工作是农业生产和商品供应中的一项具体工作，但它是与连续大跃进的形势分不开的，所以蔬菜工作的成绩，也是总路线、大跃进、人民公社三个法宝的巨大胜利。其次的一个原因是：在党的领导下，贯彻了群众路线，大搞群众运动，使蔬菜产销工作，围绕着党的中心任务进行基地建设，秋种春播等工作，特别是在去年的抗旱保苗中，提出了“人在苗子在”，“宁愿担干大河水，不让干死一窝菜”的豪迈口号，与严重干旱进行了顽强搏斗，获得了战胜干旱，夺得了丰收。再一个原因是：在市委统一领导下，大搞农商协作，把农商双方扭成一股绳，在统一认识，统一步调的前提下，商业部门抽调了一千多人，组织五十一个工作组，深入公社，协助规划生产，组织生产，共同解决困难，这就有力地促进了蔬菜生产的大发展。
    重庆市蔬菜工作，在党的领导下，虽然做出了以上成绩，但对我们来说，决不能有任何理由可以骄傲、自满，况且在生产上还不能完全避免自然灾害的威胁，这就要求我们必须月月抓、季季抓、年年抓、样样抓，丝毫也不能放松警惕。
    1960年是六十年代的第一年，在以技术革新和技术革命为中心，进一步开展大规模的增产节约运动，一定会促使工农业生产更大的持续跃进。特别是城市人民公社正在迅速建立，这就要求商业工作必须大力“发展经济、保障供给”，更好地为高速度建设社会主义作出成绩。根据过去经验证明，只要坚决地依靠党委领导，有着总路线的指路明灯，两年来大跃进的胜利基础，加上人民公社进一步巩固发展的大好形势，我们一定要在毛泽东思想教导下，要加倍努力，积极工作，使蔬菜工作取得更大的跃进和更大的胜利。
