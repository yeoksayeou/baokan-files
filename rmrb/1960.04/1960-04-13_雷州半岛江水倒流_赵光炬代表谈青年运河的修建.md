    I completely support the reports made by the two Vice Premiers Li, and I am determined to implement them.
    Here, I will give a brief report to the conference on the construction of the Guangdong Youth Canal. Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the broad masses of people in the Leizhou Peninsula have brought into play the unparalleled superiority and strong vitality of the people's communes, adhered to the Great Leap Forward, and thus created earth-shattering achievements that predecessors dared not imagine.
    The Leizhou Peninsula is located at the southernmost tip of mainland China, in the subtropical zone. It is one of the bases for planting tropical and subtropical plants in our country. After ten years of planting practice since liberation, it has been proven that most tropical and subtropical plants that can be planted on Hainan Island, such as rubber, coffee, and coconut, can also be planted and harvested here. The land area of ​​the Leizhou Peninsula is very large, and according to statistics, there are at least five million mu of arable land. However, such an ideal base for planting tropical and subtropical plants has not been developed due to the unresolved drought in the past (accounting for 60% of the arable land), and more than 2.3 million mu of farmland are also frequently plagued by drought, affecting the leap forward in agricultural production. Since liberation, we have done a lot of work and thought of many ways to solve the drought problem in the Leizhou Peninsula. But it was not until 1958, when the people of the Leizhou Peninsula, under the leadership of the Party, decided to dig a 170-kilometer-long Youth Canal from north to south, that the drought problem on the peninsula was fundamentally solved. This canal started construction in June 1958, and by mid-March this year, more than 80% has been completed, and it can be fully completed in June this year. By then, the natural landscape of the Leizhou Peninsula will be completely changed, and the Leizhou Peninsula will enter a new era of comprehensive resource development and comprehensive production development. Not only will the drought disasters of the perennially drought-stricken farmland be eliminated, but also the 2.5 million mu of wasteland that has been dormant for thousands of years will be awakened. From then on, the Leizhou Peninsula, a historically famous barren land, will not only become a land of fish and rice but also an ideal base for tropical and subtropical crops as well as sugarcane and silkworms.
      Leizhou Peninsula is a Drought-Stricken Area
    The Leizhou Peninsula is a peninsula surrounded by the sea on three sides. However, in Guangdong, it is the most water-scarce place. There is not a single lake within its borders. Except for the Jiuzhou River in the north, which rises and falls from time to time and is erratic, the other twenty-odd small streams leading to the sea will dry up in the event of drought. The terrain here is high and flat, with few forests and few clumps of grass. Therefore, although the average annual rainfall reaches 1,400 to 1,700 mm, the average annual evaporation reaches 1,500 to 1,700 mm. People say, "What Heaven gives, Heaven takes back!" Precisely because of this, from the early Song Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty, for more than a thousand years, drought disasters were frequent, and people lived in dire straits. In the event of a drought, not to mention the crops being dried to death, even the water for human consumption was extremely difficult.
    In the first few years after liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the peninsula built mountain ponds and reservoirs, dug flat ponds and ditches, and dug artesian wells, and thousands of small-scale water conservancy projects appeared on the peninsula. However, the water conservancy problem on the peninsula could not be fundamentally solved. In 1955, when the peninsula experienced a drought unseen in a century, people thought, "To solve the drought on the peninsula, we must block the Jiuzhou River in the northern part of the peninsula, store the water of the Jiuzhou River, and make the water of the Jiuzhou River flow backward. We must divert it to the plains of the peninsula (which is the now completed Hedi Reservoir), and dig a river in the highest area from north to south of the peninsula (which is the soon-to-be-completed Youth Canal) to solve the problem. However, according to the results of the survey, this project is very large. People could not imagine that this huge project could be completed under the conditions at that time. It was planned to make specific plans during the Second Five-Year Plan and complete it during the Third Five-Year Plan. However, in 1958, the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction was announced, and people dared to think and dared to act, and immediately transformed the past ideal plan into reality. The Leizhou Youth Canal started construction in June 1958. Especially after the establishment of the People's Commune in September, the manpower, material resources, and financial resources that were difficult to solve in the past were all readily solved. The work that was considered to be completed within two five-year plans in the past was fully completed in just two years from the start of construction in June 1958 to June this year. The project, which was considered to require a national investment of 150 million yuan to build in the past, was changed to be built with the help of the people and the government, and was built with only 30 million yuan from the state. The birth and completion of this large-scale water conservancy project, which is so large in scale, so fast in speed, and so little in expenditure, once again proves the unparalleled correctness and power of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction; it also proves once again the victory of the Great Leap Forward and the victory of the People's Commune.
    The scale and engineering of the Leizhou Youth Canal are huge and extremely difficult. It includes a Hedi Reservoir and three large "melon-bearing" reservoirs, a main river channel 178 kilometers long and more than 30 meters wide at the bottom, and a total of more than 4,000 kilometers of large and small irrigation canals. The total amount of earth and stone work reaches 100 million cubic meters. The leading project upstream of the canal is the Hedi Reservoir. Its main dam cuts off the Jiuzhou River, which is erratic and often causes trouble for people. This large reservoir with an irrigation area of ​​2.5 million mu and three large "melon-bearing" reservoirs with a total irrigation area of ​​500,000 mu were completed successively last year. Standing on the dam and looking out, it is a vast expanse of man-made sea. Connected to the Hedi Reservoir, the Youth Canal extends from north to south to the Nandu River in Haikang, leading to the East China Sea. The northern section of the canal must pass through twenty-two mountain tops (these twenty-two mountain tops have now been leveled), and the southern section must fill countless depressions and streams. On both sides of the main river channel are countless branch canals, running across the east and west sides of the peninsula. At present, 82% of the entire canal project has been completed. After the completion of the entire project, the historically famous drought-stricken Leizhou Peninsula will become a water network area, basically realizing water conservancy. The ideals that people have dreamed of for generations have been quickly realized under the leadership of the Party. How many people still have tears in their eyes when they talk about it, and they are full of energy when they do it.
        The Youth Canal Brings Great Changes
    Naturally, the benefits of the completion of the Youth Canal are not limited to eliminating drought in the Leizhou Peninsula. In addition to eliminating drought, the following major changes will also occur. First, the sleeping wilderness will soon wake up. More than 2 million mu of wilderness will be turned into arable land with self-flowing irrigation. Second, power stations and factories will be scattered all over the place. Medium and small-sized power stations and various agricultural and sideline product processing plants, such as sugar factories, paper mills, and grain starch processing plants, will gradually appear along the canal and on the main channels, greatly promoting the rapid development of rural mechanization and electrification. Third, inland and outer sea transportation will be accessible in all directions. After the completion of the canal, motorized sailing boats of 50 tons or more can navigate the river surface unobstructed throughout the year. Taking the canal as the main line, there will be two inland river routes running across the peninsula, greatly shortening the voyage from Zhanjiang to Beihai by more than 400 kilometers around the Qiongzhou Strait. Fourth, production will be richer, and people's lives will be improved. The poor and backward state of the Leizhou Peninsula in the past will be forever eliminated. Fifth, the climate will undergo tremendous changes. Because the Leizhou Peninsula has few rivers and lakes, few forests and clumps of grass, coupled with the dry climate and strong evaporation, the soil erosion is very serious. After the canal is opened, the canal network is densely covered, and tropical trees are shaded by greenery, the dry and hot climate of the peninsula will undergo tremendous changes.
    On May 15, 1958, the Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China announced the decision to build the Youth Canal. The people of the Leizhou Peninsula were overjoyed and told each other, and the entire peninsula was boiling. "Go to build the canal!" became the public opinion and action of the people of the entire peninsula. After the decision to build the canal was issued, the masses rushed to the Hedi Reservoir, unable to stop them. Li Peihan, an old man from Buling Commune in Leibei County, his son sacrificed his life to participate in the revolution before liberation, and the cadres said that they would not let him go. But he secretly carried a bag of rice, took a hoe, and walked for two days and two nights to the construction site of the Hedi Reservoir. People did not let him work, and he said, "My ancestors have been waiting for thousands of years, and my son shed blood and sacrificed his life, all for today, you can't stop me, there is no reason to stop me." Mo Hu, the leader of the Youth Commando Team of Hengshan Commune, has been taking the construction site as his home since he participated in the construction of the canal. His commando team has won the red flag for fifteen consecutive times. His wife gave birth to their first son during the canal construction, and they named the child "Yinhe" (Silver River) to commemorate the construction of the canal.
    People's Communes Provide Manpower and Materials for Canal Construction
    At that time, it was indeed difficult to build such a huge water conservancy project by adopting the method of people-run and government-assisted. However, after the masses were mobilized, coupled with the establishment of the People's Commune, it provided a material guarantee for the use of labor, funds, and the training of technical talents. When the masses came to build the canal, they implemented the "five selfs" method of bringing their own tools, bringing their own food, building their own sheds, running their own factories, and learning their own technology, which greatly saved the state's funds. According to preliminary statistics, the area of ​​construction of sheds built by the masses and communes to support the construction of the canal reached 600,000 square meters, and 3,000 cubic meters of timber were brought in. In order to solve the difficulty of equipment, the masses adopted the method of self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and established nine cement factories at the construction site, producing 2,500 tons of cement; two machinery repair factories, solving the repair problems of all machinery at the construction site; twenty-nine explosives factories, producing 241 tons of explosives; in addition, hundreds of iron factories, wood factories, etc. were established to manufacture a large number of tools for the construction of the canal. In order to solve the shortage of technical personnel, the commune also ran red and expert schools at the construction site, training more than 10,500 technical personnel of various types, so that the canal could be surveyed, designed, and constructed at the same time, and could be built at high speed.
    Naturally, after communization, the unparalleled superiority of the commune was demonstrated in the unified arrangement of labor force and the solution of the food and wages of the migrant workers. Under the circumstances that the labor force in all aspects has been in serious shortage since the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking in 1958, the communes can still transfer 70,000 laborers for long-term large-scale operations, and more than 200,000 people have been transferred to participate in canal construction during the great assault. The Hedi Reservoir's emergency rescue also illustrates this point. Last summer, due to the extraordinary floods, the Jiuzhou River encountered a flood peak unseen in a century. If there were not enough laborers to invest in emergency rescue, the newly-blocked dam would collapse. When the construction site headquarters issued a request to increase the labor force, the members of the communes quickly arrived at the construction site from dozens or even 100 or 200 kilometers away, and defeated the flood at the speed of one inch of water higher, one foot of dam higher. The strength of the commune also played a huge role in the allocation and support of material and financial resources. According to the survey of five communes, materials from them for more than a year including food, vegetable money, wages, and tools, amounted to a total of 3,547,000 yuan, averaging more than 700,000 yuan per commune. Without communization, it would be difficult to carry out such a large-scale water conservancy project with the help of the people and the government. This shows that with the commune, not only can small and medium-sized water conservancy projects be carried out with the help of the people and the government, but also large-scale water conservancy projects can be carried out with the help of the people and the government.
    The construction of the Leizhou Youth Canal also shows that in a country like ours, as long as it is for the cause of the people, it will receive support from all parties, and the noble style of communism has been vividly reflected once again in the process of canal construction. The Hedi Reservoir project will submerge more than 20,000 mu of fertile land in Luchuan and Bobai counties in Guangxi, and relocate villages with nearly 10,000 people, but the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee and the Luchuan and Bobai County Party Committees supported us in the spirit of communism, and mobilized and persuaded the people in the submerged areas to relocate in a communist style. We extend our deep gratitude. From the perspective of the construction of the canal itself, the people in the non-beneficiary areas also carried food and firewood and came from dozens or even hundreds of kilometers away to assist in the construction. After hearing the news of the construction of the Youth Canal, the young people of many counties in the Zhanjiang area selected the best representatives and formed a support team to contribute everything to changing the natural landscape of the Leizhou Peninsula. The support team members in Maoming City could not wait for the car, so they carried their luggage and walked 80 kilometers in a day and night to the canal construction site. The troops stationed in the Zhanjiang area and the cadres of the agencies also participated in the construction of the canal. The construction site was full of vitality from beginning to end, and a revolutionary heroic challenge competition was launched. It is truly inspiring, high-spirited, and high-spirited. The progress of the entire project is getting faster and faster, and people's enthusiasm is getting greater and greater. In the process of canal construction, 130 advanced units and 26,419 model figures emerged before and after, and a large number of cadres and technical workers were trained. A large number of activists emerged, and thousands of outstanding members joined the Party and the League. In the process of fighting against nature, people's mental outlook has undergone great changes.
    The construction of the Leizhou Youth Canal is one example of the thousands upon thousands of "miracles" that have appeared in the great motherland in the era of Mao Zedong. There is a popular folk song in the Leizhou Peninsula that can well summarize the style of our era and our people:
    "Satellites can go to the sky, the earth can be dug through, what is the difficulty in moving mountains, as long as the determination is firm!"
    This is a concrete portrayal of the style of our great era and our people under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

    雷州半岛江水倒流
    赵光炬代表谈青年运河的修建
    我完全拥护两位李副总理所作的报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
    这里我把广东青年运河修建的经过情况向大会做个简单汇报。雷州半岛广大人民群众在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，发挥了人民公社的无比优越性和强大的生命力，坚持了大跃进，因而创造了开天辟地的、前人不敢想像的业迹。
    雷州半岛在我国大陆的最南端，地处亚热带。是我国热带、亚热带植物种植的基地之一。解放后，经过十年的种植实践证明：海南岛可以种植的大部分热带、亚热带植物，如橡胶、咖啡、椰子等，在这里也完全可以种植而有收获。雷州半岛的土地面积很大，据统计可耕地面积最少有五百万亩。但是，这样一个种植热带、亚热带植物的理想基地，过去由于干旱未有解决，所以很多可耕地未曾开发（占可耕地60％），二百三十多万亩的农田也经常苦旱，影响了农业生产的跃进。解放以后，在解决雷州半岛的干旱问题上，我们曾做了不少工作，想了不少办法。但直到1958年，雷州半岛的人民在党的领导下，决定由北到南挖一条全长一百七十公里的青年运河，半岛的干旱问题才得到根本性的解决。这条运河是1958年6月动工的，到今年3月中旬，已经完工80％以上，今年6月可以全部完工。至此，雷州半岛的自然面貌将全部改观，雷州半岛将进入资源全面开发、生产全面发展的崭新时期，不仅连年苦旱的农田的旱患得以消灭，就是沉睡了几千年的二百五十多万亩荒原也将被唤醒。从此，雷州半岛，这个在历史上有名的荒凉的不毛之地，不仅变为鱼米之乡，而且将成为热带、亚热带作物以及甘蔗、桑蚕的理想基地。
      雷州半岛是一个干旱的地方
    雷州半岛是三面被海水包围的一个半岛。但是，在广东来说，它却是一个最缺水的地方。境内没有半片湖泊，除了北部有一条时涨时枯、变幻无常的九洲江外，其他二十多条通海小溪，一遇上干旱就要断流。这里地势高亢而又平坦，即少森林也少丛草，所以，年雨量平均虽达一千四百到一千七百公厘，但是蒸发量平均每年却达一千五百到一千七百公厘。人们说：“老天爷给的，老天爷又拿了回去！”正是因为这样，所以从宋初至清末这一千多年时间内，旱灾频连、民不聊生，一闹旱灾，不要说作物被旱死，就是连人饮的水也异常困难。
    解放后的头几年，半岛人民在党的领导下，曾经修山塘、水库，挖平塘、水沟，挖自流井，在半岛上出现了数以千计的小型水利工程。但是，仍不能根本解决半岛的水利问题。在1955年，半岛出现百年未遇的干旱时，人们曾想过：“要解决半岛的干旱，就要拦住半岛北部的九洲江，把九洲江的水堵蓄起来，使九洲江的水倒流，把它引到半岛平原（这就是现在已经竣工的鹤地水库），在半岛由北到南最高地带挖一条河（这就是即将竣工的青年运河），才能解决问题。但是，根据勘测的结果，这件工程非常浩大。人们无法想像在当时的情况下能完成这项巨大的工程。预备在第二个五年计划时做出具体规划，留到第三个五年计划时再来完成。但是，到了1958年，党的社会主义建设总路线公布了，人们敢想敢干，把过去的理想方案要马上变为现实。雷州青年运河在1958年6月动工修建。尤其是9月人民公社成立，过去认为很难解决的人力、物力、财力问题都迎刃而解。过去认为要在两个五年计划内才能完成的工作，从1958年6月开始动工，到今年6月仅仅两年的时间，就全部完成了。过去认为需要国家投资一亿五千万元才能兴建的工程，结果改为民办公助，仅由国家帮助三千万元就兴建好了。这一规模如此巨大，速度如此之快，花钱如此之少的大型水利工程诞生与建成，再一次证明了党的社会主义建设总路线的无比正确与威力；也再一次证明了大跃进的胜利，人民公社的胜利。
    雷州青年运河的规模和工程是巨大而且极其艰巨的。它包括一个鹤地水库和三个大型的“结瓜”水库，一条长一百七十八公里，底宽三十多米的主河道和共长四千多公里的大小灌溉渠。土石方工程量共达一亿公方。运河上游的首脑工程是鹤地水库。它的主坝拦腰截断了变幻无常，经常与人为患的九洲江。这个灌溉面积达二百五十万亩的大水库和三个大型灌溉面积共达五十万亩的“结瓜”水库，已于去年先后完成。站在坝上一望，它是百里茫茫的一片人造海。和鹤地水库相联的青年运河河道从北向南伸延，直至海康南渡河边，通向东海，运河的北段要穿过二十二座山头（这二十二座山头，现在已被削平），南段要填平无数洼地和溪流。主河道两旁，是无数支渠，横贯半岛东西两面。现在运河全线的工程已完成82％。全部工程完成后，历史上干旱著名的雷州半岛将变为水网地带，基本上实现水利化。人们世世代代梦寐以求的理想，在党的领导下迅速地变为现实。多少人现在谈起来仍旧是热泪盈眶，干起来又是干劲冲天。
        青年运河带来巨大的变化
    自然，青年运河的建成后的好处，决不仅仅是使雷州半岛消灭旱患。除掉消灭旱患外，还将发生如下几个方面的巨大变化。一、沉睡的荒原即将苏醒。将有二百多万亩荒原变为自流灌溉的良田。二、电站、工厂将星罗密布。运河沿线及主干渠道上的中、小型发电站和各种农副业产品加工厂，如糖厂、纸厂、粮食淀粉加工厂等，将陆续出现，大大促进农村机械化和电气化的迅速发展。三、内河外海交通将四通八达。运河完成后，五十吨以上的机帆船可以全年无阻通航河面，以运河为干线，将有两条横贯半岛的内河航线，大大缩短湛江到北海要绕道琼州海峡四百多公里的航程。四、生产将更丰富，人民生活将更加改善。雷州半岛过去那种贫困落后的状态，将永远摆脱。五、气候将发生巨大变化。由于雷州半岛既少河流湖泊，又少森林丛草，加上气候干燥，蒸发力强，水土流失十分严重。当运河贯通，渠网密布，热带林木绿化成荫之后，半岛干旱燥热的气候，将发生巨大变化。
    1958年5月15日，中共湛江地委公布了关于兴建青年运河的决定。雷州半岛人民，惊喜若狂，奔走相告，整个半岛都沸腾了起来。“修运河去！”成了全半岛人民的舆论和行动。兴修运河的决定一发出后，群众争着奔向鹤地水库，拦也拦不住。雷北县不岭公社一个老人李培汗，他的儿子在解放前参加革命牺牲了，干部们说什么也不叫他去。但是他偷偷地背一袋米，带一把锄头，步行了两天两夜，到鹤地水库工地上去。人们不叫他干活，他说：“我的祖先盼了几千年，我的儿子流血牺牲，都是为了今天，你们不能拦阻我，没有理由拦阻我。”横山公社的青年突击队长莫湖，自从参加修运河后，就一直以工地为家，他的突击队曾经一连夺过十五次红旗。他的妻子在修河中生下第一个男孩，他们为了纪念运河的兴建，把孩子取名叫“银河”。
    人民公社给修河提供了人力、物力
    当时，兴建这样巨大的水利工程，采取民办公助的办法，的确是存在不少困难的。但是，当群众发动起来后，再加上人民公社的成立，这就给使用劳动力、资金、培养技术人才等方面，提供了物质力量的保证。群众在来兴修运河时，实行了自带工具、自带粮食、自搭工棚、自办工厂、自学技术的“五自”办法，大大地节省了国家资金。据初步统计，群众和公社支援运河建设，在工地自搭工棚的建筑面积达六十万平方米，自带木材达三千立方米。为了解决器材的困难，群众采取自力更生、土洋结合的办法，在工地建立了水泥厂九间，生产水泥二千五百吨；机械修理厂二间，解决了工地全部机械的修理问题；炸药厂二十九间，生产炸药二百四十一吨；此外，还建立了数以百计的铁工厂、木工厂等，为运河建设制造了大批工具。为了解决技术力量不足的困难，公社还在工地大办红专学校，培养出各种技术人员一万零五百多人，使运河实现了边测量、边设计、边施工，得以高速度地进行建设。
    自然，公社化后，在统一安排劳动力，解决民工粮食和工资问题上，都显示了公社的无比优越性。1958年大炼钢铁、以及大跃进以来各方面劳动力都十分缺乏的情况下，各公社还能抽调七万劳动力长期进行大兵团作战，在大突击的时候，曾抽调过二十多万人参加修河。鹤地水库抢险时，也说明了这点。去年夏天，由于特大洪水，九洲江遇上百年来未有的洪峰，如果没有足够劳动力投入抢险，才堵好的拦河大坝就会崩塌。当工地指挥部发出要求增加劳动力时，各公社的社员，从数十公里甚至一、二百公里远的地方，迅速到达了工地，以水高一寸、坝高一尺的速度战胜了洪水。在物力、财力的调配和支援上公社力量也起了巨大的作用。据调查五个公社的材料，一年多来即拿出粮食、菜金、工资、工具等折合款项共三百五十四万七千元，平均每个公社达七十多万元。没有公社化，这样大的水利工程要民办公助的搞起来是很困难的。这说明了：有了公社以后，不但中小型的水利工程可以民办公助来搞，就是大型的水利工程也可以民办公助来搞了。
    雷州青年运河的兴建，也说明了在我们这样的国家里，只要是为了人民的事业，它就会得到各个方面的支援，共产主义高尚风格在运河修建的过程中，又得到了一次生动的体现。鹤地水库的工程，要淹没广西陆川和博白两县二万多亩良田，搬迁近万人口的村庄，但广西僮族自治区党委和陆川、博白县委以共产主义的精神，支持了我们，动员说服被淹地区的人民以共产主义风格搬迁了。我们深致谢意。从运河本身的兴建来讲，非受益地区的人民，也背着粮食，带着柴草，从数十里甚至一二百里之外，赶来协助兴建。湛江专区许多县的青年听到了兴修青年运河的消息后，选派最优秀的代表，组成了支援队，为改变雷州半岛的自然面貌贡献出自己的一切。茂名市的支援队员，等不到汽车，他们自己背起行装，一昼夜走了八十公里赶到了运河工地。湛江专区的驻军和机关干部也参加了运河的建设。工地上自始至终生气勃勃，开展着革命英雄主义的挑战竞赛。真正是精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。整个工程的进行是越来越快，人们的干劲是越来越大。在运河兴建过程中，前后涌现出一百三十个先进单位和二万六千四百一十九个模范人物，培养了大批干部和技术工人，涌现出大批积极分子，数以千计的优秀分子，参加了党，参加了团。在对大自然作战的过程中，人们的精神面貌有了很大的改变。
    雷州青年运河的兴建，是毛泽东时代伟大祖国出现的万万千千“奇迹”中的一个实例。雷州半岛现在流行着一首民歌，很能概括我们时代和人民的风貌：
    “卫星能上天，地球能挖穿，移山有何难，只要决心坚！”
    这正是我们这一伟大时代和人民，在党和毛主席领导下的风貌的具体写照。
