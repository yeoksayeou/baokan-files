    Vigorously Develop Cement "Small Foreign Groups"
    Representative Wang Tao Discusses High-Speed Development of Cement Production
    Representatives,

    I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. I would like to offer some opinions on the development of the cement industry for your reference.

    Under the correct guidance of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and the principle of "walking on two legs," China's cement industry has developed significantly. In particular, after the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, China's cement production increased from 6.86 million tons in 1957 to 12.27 million tons in 1959, basically achieving the production target for the final year (1962) of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. In just two short years, cement production has nearly doubled, a tremendous growth rate that no capitalist country could possibly achieve.

    The reason why China's cement industry has developed at such a high speed is that, while tapping the production potential of existing enterprises, a number of modern large and medium-sized cement enterprises have been newly built and expanded. On the other hand, the implementation of the principle of "walking on two legs" and the vigorous development of "small foreign groups" and "small native groups" have exerted tremendous power. Over the past two years, "small native groups," after consolidation and improvement, have developed into foreign or hybrid small cement enterprises. In 1959, small cement enterprises produced more than 1.72 million tons of cement of grade 300 or higher, accounting for one-seventh of the total cement production for the year, strongly supporting national industrial and agricultural production and construction. According to preliminary statistics, among the 760 small cement enterprises, 130 have an annual output of more than 15,000 tons and less than 100,000 tons, with a production capacity of more than 3.6 million tons. At the same time, according to our investigation of ten provinces and cities, the production capacity of small cement enterprises in each province and city is more than 300,000 tons, and the highest province reaches more than 1 million tons. In addition, the state has arranged for the construction of another 200 sets of vertical kiln cement plants this year (excluding those built by the localities themselves). Therefore, it can be seen from this that the production potential of small cement enterprises is very large. According to the development of the technological innovation and technical revolution movement in the past month or so, various small cement enterprises have created many advanced experiences in technological innovation and technical revolution, greatly improving output, quality, and labor productivity, and reducing costs. Taking Liaoning Province as an example, some small foreign plants, due to vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technical revolution, have increased the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization from about 20% to more than 80%. Among them, the cement workshop of Dalian Chemical Plant has realized three automatic lines, reducing the number of workers from the original 299 to 179, and increasing the degree of mechanization from the original 21.8% to 88%; the degree of mechanization of Andong Cement Plant has also increased from the original 25% to 85%, and the quality of cement is stable at grade 400. The small cement enterprises in Henan Province have basically realized the track transportation within the factory; Xinxiang Cement Plant has strengthened production control and equipment maintenance and repair, and its actual production capacity has exceeded the design capacity by nearly one time. At present, the cost of each ton of cement in various small cement enterprises has been reduced from about 100 yuan last year to 50 to 60 yuan, and some have approached the level of large foreign plants. From the above facts, it can be seen that as long as the masses are fully mobilized and actively invested in the technological innovation and technical revolution movement, the huge production potential can be fully utilized, and mechanization, semi-mechanization, and automation, and semi-automation can be quickly realized.

    Why have small cement enterprises developed so quickly? Because small cement enterprises require less investment, have a faster construction speed, and have relatively simple technical requirements, which can produce immediate results. Taking Hebei Province as an example, under the attention and support of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, they have built 37 small cement enterprises with more than 10,000 tons in more than a year, with an annual production capacity of about 1 million tons. The total investment only cost 35 million yuan, with an average production capacity of only 35 yuan per ton, which is more than 30 yuan less per ton of capacity compared with a large cement enterprise with an annual output of 600,000 tons. In terms of construction time, these large cement enterprises generally require two and a half years or more, while a small vertical kiln cement plant with an annual output of 32,000 tons generally only takes about half a year to build.

    Due to the rapid development of the iron and steel industry, a large amount of slag has been produced, which is waste material from ironmaking, but it is precisely the best raw material for the cement industry. Using 80 to 85% of water-quenched blast furnace slag, plus 15 to 20% of gypsum, grinding them together can produce gypsum slag cement with good quality, and the grade can not only reach 300 or 400, but even 500. This cement is most suitable for use in underwater projects, but it can also be used in various important projects like ordinary cement. In addition to using gypsum slag cement to build a four-story building of 1,900 square meters, Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, has also used it in highway bridges, river dams, and railway bridges. The gypsum slag cement produced by Chengdu Cement Plant in Sichuan Province has a grade of mostly above 600. It has been fully used in various projects, including crane beams and trusses of reinforced concrete projects, with good results. Establishing a gypsum slag cement plant is even simpler than a vertical kiln cement plant with an annual output of 32,000 tons. It does not require building a kiln, nor does it require mining transportation equipment and limestone crushing equipment, let alone finding mineral resources. With two ball mills of the same specifications as a vertical kiln cement plant with an annual output of 32,000 tons, 50,000 tons of cement can be produced annually. Therefore, the construction speed of a gypsum slag cement plant can be even faster, and the investment can be even more saved. This year's pig iron production is 27.5 million tons (excluding native iron). Calculated at 0.6 tons of slag per ton of pig iron, 16.5 million tons of slag can be produced. In addition to 6.5 million tons to ensure the needs of large and medium-sized cement plants, the remaining 10 million tons of slag, as long as it is water-quenched, can be used to manufacture gypsum slag cement and supply the needs of other small cement enterprises. Blast furnace slag is an indispensable raw material for large, medium, and small cement plants. Wherever there is ironmaking (whether foreign iron or native iron), as long as simple water quenching equipment is added, a gypsum slag cement plant can be established there. That is to say, with the continuous leap forward of the iron and steel industry and the establishment of scattered iron and steel enterprises, the raw material base of the cement industry has been greatly expanded, thereby driving the leap forward development of the cement industry. This year's cement production plan is 16 million tons, which is far from meeting the needs of national construction. According to the ratio of steel to cement of 1:1.2 during the First Five-Year Plan period, this year's cement production cannot pass the test without 20 million tons. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously develop the production of gypsum slag cement, and like the large-scale steelmaking in 1958, launch a mass movement for gypsum slag cement, which will not only solve the problem of cement shortage this year, but also lay the foundation for the rapid development of the cement industry in the future.

    Lime-burnt clay cement played a great role in supporting the large-scale farmland water conservancy movement carried out in the vast rural areas throughout the country in 1958. The production method and equipment of this cement are very simple. After more than a year of development, with the efforts of teachers and students of the Department of Civil Engineering of Tsinghua University, the grade of this cement has been increased from the original 150 to 300, thus greatly expanding its scope of use. After actual use, it has been proven that it can not only be used in farmland water conservancy projects, but also in civil buildings and urban construction, especially for the construction of people's communes.

    From the above, it can be seen that the "small foreign groups" and "small native groups" cement enterprises have the advantages of obtaining materials locally, producing locally, using locally, rationally arranging the cement industry, and widely utilizing resources, saving transportation power, etc., which are fully in line with the policy of developing the cement industry with more, faster, better, and more economical results.

    The rapid growth and development of small cement enterprises is a great victory for the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, a great victory for the mass movement, and a great victory for the technological innovation and technical revolution. Therefore, I fully support the proposal made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun in his report: "In 1960, all industrial departments and transportation departments, all localities and people's communes should continue to actively develop a number of 'small foreign group' enterprises and 'small native group' enterprises, and at the same time improve the production level of the original 'small foreign group' enterprises and 'small native group' enterprises." This will play a greater role in overfulfilling this year's production plan and realizing sustained leaps forward in the future.

### 大力发展水泥“小洋群”  王涛代表谈高速度发展水泥生产

    大力发展水泥“小洋群”
    王涛代表谈高速度发展水泥生产代表们：
    我完全同意李富春和李先念二位副总理的报告。我现就水泥工业的发展情况提出些意见供代表们参考。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线和“两条腿走路”方针的正确指导下，我国水泥工业有了很大的发展，特别是经过1958年和1959年连续两年的大跃进，使我国水泥产量由1957年的六百八十六万吨增长到1959年的一千二百二十七万吨，提前三年基本上实现了第二个五年计划最后一年（1962年）的产量指标。短短两年的时间，水泥产量翻了将近一番，这样巨大的增长速度是任何一个资本主义国家不可能有的。
    我国水泥工业之所以有这样高速度的发展，一方面在挖掘原有企业的生产潜力的同时，新建和扩建了一批现代化的大中型水泥企业。另一方面由于贯彻了“两条腿走路的方针”，大搞“小洋群”、“小土群”发挥了巨大的威力。两年以来，“小土群”经过巩固和提高，已发展成洋的或土洋结合的小型水泥企业。1959年小型水泥企业共生产了一百七十二万多吨三百号以上的水泥，相当于全年水泥总产量的七分之一，有力地支援了国家工农业生产建设。根据初步统计，在七百六十个小型水泥企业中，年产一万五千吨以上、十万吨以下的就有一百三十个，生产能力达到三百六十多万吨。同时根据我们对十个省市的调查，各省市小型水泥企业的生产能力都在三十万吨以上，最高的省分达到一百万吨以上。此外，今年国家又布置了二百套立窑水泥厂的建设（地方自建的不包括在内）。因此从这里可以看出，小型水泥企业的生产潜力是很大的。根据最近一个多月来技术革新和技术革命运动发展的情况来看，各个小型水泥企业创造了许多技术革新和技术革命的先进经验，大大地提高产量、质量和劳动生产率，降低了成本。以辽宁省为例，部分小洋厂，由于大闹技术革新和技术革命，机械化和半机械化程度已由原来的20％左右提高到80％以上，其中大连化工厂水泥车间实现了三条自动线，工人人数由原来的二百九十九人减到一百七十九人，机械化程度由原来的21.8％提高到88％；安东水泥厂的机械化程度也由原来的25％提高到85％，而且水泥的质量稳定在四百号。河南省的小型水泥企业，基本上实现了厂内运输轨道化；新乡水泥厂由于加强了生产控制和设备的维护检修，它的实际生产能力已超过设计能力将近一倍。目前各小型水泥企业每吨水泥的成本已由去年一百元左右，降低到五十至六十元，有的已接近大洋厂的水平。从以上这些事实可以看出，只要充分发动群众，积极投入技术革新和技术革命运动中去，巨大的生产潜力是完全可以发挥出来的，机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化即可迅速实现。
    小型水泥企业为什么会发展得这样快呢？因为小型水泥企业的投资小、建设速度快、技术要求比较简单，可以立竿见影。以河北省为例，他们在中共省委和省人委的重视和支持下，在一年多的时间内建成了万吨以上的小型水泥企业三十七个，年产能力达到一百万吨左右，全部投资只花了三千五百万元，平均每吨生产能力仅为三十五元，与年产六十万吨大型水泥企业比较，每吨能力要少花投资三十元以上。在建设时间方面，这些大型水泥企业一般需要两年半或更多的时间，而年产三万二千吨的小型立窑水泥厂一般只需要半年左右就可建成。
    由于钢铁工业的飞跃发展，产生了大量的矿渣，它是炼铁的废料，但恰恰是水泥工业的最好原料。用80至85％的水淬高炉矿渣，加上15至20％的石膏，一起磨细，就可生产出质量很好的石膏矿渣水泥，标号不仅可以达到三百号、四百号，甚至可以达到五百号。这种水泥最适宜用在水中工程，但也和普通水泥一样可以用在各种重要工程上。山西省阳泉市除了用石膏矿渣水泥修建了一千九百平方米的四层大楼以外，还将它用在公路桥、河坝和铁路桥等工程。四川成都水泥厂生产的石膏矿渣水泥，标号大都在六百号以上。已充分使用在各种工程上，其中有钢筋混凝土工程的吊车梁、桁架等，效果良好。建立石膏矿渣水泥比年产三万二千吨的立窑水泥厂还要简单，它不需要建窑，也不需要矿山的开采运输设备和石灰石的破碎设备，更不需要寻找矿山资源，用两台和年产三万二千吨立窑水泥厂同规格的球磨，每年就可生产五万吨水泥，因此石膏矿渣水泥厂的建设速度还可更快，投资还可更省。今年生铁的产量是二千七百五十万吨（不包括土铁），按每吨生铁产零点六吨矿渣计算，可生产一千六百五十万吨矿渣，其中除了六百五十万吨保证供应大中型水泥厂需要以外，其余的一千万吨矿渣，只要经过水淬都可用来制造石膏矿渣水泥和供应其他小型水泥企业需要。高炉矿渣是大中小型水泥厂不可缺少的原料，凡是有炼铁（不论洋铁和土铁）的地方，只要增加简单的水淬设备，那里就可建立石膏矿渣水泥厂，这就是说，随着钢铁工业的不断跃进，随着星罗棋布的钢铁企业的建立，大大地扩大了水泥工业的原料基地，从而带动了水泥工业的飞跃发展。今年水泥的生产计划是一千六百万吨，远远不能满足国家建设的需要。按照第一个五年计划期间钢与水泥的比例一比一点二计算，今年水泥的产量没有两千万吨就过不了关。因此必须大力发展石膏矿渣水泥的生产，和1958年大炼钢铁一样，大搞石膏矿渣水泥的群众运动，这不仅可以解决今年水泥不足的问题，而且为今后迅速发展水泥工业奠定了基础。
    石灰烧粘土水泥在1958年对支援全国广大农村开展的大规模的农田水利化运动曾起了很大作用。这种水泥的生产方法和设备都很简单。经过一年多的发展，在清华大学土木系师生的努力钻研下，这种水泥的标号已由原来的一百五十号提高到三百号，因而大大扩大了它的使用范围。经过实际使用证明，它不仅可以用在农田水利工程，而且也可用在民用建筑和城市建设，特别是对人民公社的建设有很大作用。
    从上面所说的可以看出，“小洋群”和“小土群”水泥企业所具有的就地取材、就地生产、就地使用，合理进行水泥工业布局和广泛利用资源，节约运输力量等优点，是完全符合多、快、好、省发展水泥工业的方针的。
    小型水泥企业的迅速成长和发展壮大，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利，是大搞群众运动的伟大胜利，是大闹技术革新和技术革命的伟大胜利。因此我完全拥护李富春副总理在报告中所提出的：“各个工业部门和交通运输部门，各个地方和人民公社，在1960年都应当继续积极地发展一批‘小洋群’企业和‘小土群’企业，同时提高原有的‘小洋群’企业和‘小土群’企业的生产水平。”这对于超额完成今年的生产计划和实现今后的持续跃进，将会起到更巨大的作用。
