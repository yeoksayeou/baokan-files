I fully agree with and support the work reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Vice Premier Li Fuchun proposed in his report to "implement comprehensive utilization of wood as much as possible..." Now I will make a speech on this issue.

Wood is an important material in national construction. It is not only needed in large quantities for capital construction, but can also be comprehensively utilized to manufacture many raw materials and materials needed for industrial production and construction. In the past two years of the Great Leap Forward, although my province has supplied a large amount of logs to the country, the felled wood has not been fully utilized rationally. From the felling of wood to its processing into timber, a large amount of branches, leaves, bark, wood ends, sawdust, etc., are discarded, and the actual utilization rate of wood only accounts for 60 percent. What is discarded, however, can be used as raw materials for forestry chemical production. In addition to the existing wood reserves that can be used for long-term felling and utilization, my province also has more than 1,200 kinds of wild plants that can be used to manufacture fibers, tannins, oils, starches, and medicines. Coupled with my province's mild climate, long plant growing season, rapid forest land renewal, and abundant power resources such as water and wind power, this makes my province possess inexhaustible resources, which can fully develop forestry chemical production in a faster, better, and more economical way.

After analyzing the above situation, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China affirmed that "comprehensive utilization of wood has great potential" and issued a special instruction on this, calling on the people of the province to liberate their minds, develop comprehensive utilization of wood with the same vigor as steelmaking, and establish forestry chemical plants on a large scale. Comrade Ye Fei, the first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, also personally went deep into the forest areas and factories for inspection and gave many important instructions, instructing party committees at all levels to strengthen their leadership over this work. Subsequently, a mass movement to run forestry chemical plants by the whole people was launched throughout the province. From forest areas to coastal areas, from rural areas to cities, small forestry chemical plants were universally established. Not only state-owned logging farms and communes' large teams and production teams ran them, but also various government agencies, troops, schools, and urban neighborhoods ran them, so that forestry chemical industry quickly appeared in a new situation of blossoming everywhere. As of the end of March this year, more than 7,150 small forestry chemical plants of various scales have been built in the province (of which those run by communes and large teams account for 9%), and they have generally started producing more than 20 kinds of forestry chemical products such as fiberboard, tannin extract, plywood, particleboard, thick cardboard, aromatic oils, rayon, and activated carbon. Only the 208 small indigenous fiberboard factories in the province produced more than 52 tons of fiberboard for the country in just over two months this year.

In the mass movement of running forestry chemical industry in our province, we adhered to the policy of "walking on two legs," that is, adopting the method of simultaneous development by the state and the communes. On the one hand, we fully utilized the great superiority of the people's communes to make small indigenous forestry chemical plants blossom everywhere; on the other hand, we actively deployed and focused on establishing relatively large-scale state-owned small foreign forestry chemical plants as the backbone. At present, the Fuzhou Wood Comprehensive Utilization Processing Factory's fiberboard workshop with an annual output of 2,000 tons and the fiberboard factories in Nanping Xiqin, Longyan, and Zhangzhou, each with an annual output of 600 tons, have been completed (in addition, 1,000 large indigenous forestry chemical plants with an annual output of 60 tons of fiberboard and 30 tons of tannin extract will also be built). These factories have better equipment, more product types, and certain technical strength, which sets a benchmark for the development of small indigenous factories, points out the direction, and can also cooperate to solve some technical problems and train technical personnel. The rich experience created by the small indigenous factories, in turn, promotes the development of the small foreign factories. Therefore, the completion and commissioning of this batch of small foreign forestry chemical plants will not only rapidly increase product output and improve quality, but also lay a preliminary foundation for the development of the forestry chemical industry in our province from indigenous to foreign.

My province started engaging in forestry chemical production in 1958, but in the past year or so, it basically remained at the trial stage in some areas. The reason why forestry chemical industry could not be rapidly and universally developed in the province at that time was mainly due to the obstacle of right-leaning conservative thinking. People lacked understanding of the importance and possibility of running this industry, so they always emphasized the difficulties of insufficient labor, lack of technical knowledge, and lack of equipment. Therefore, it is necessary to first break through the ideological obstacles in order to open up a broad road for the development of forestry chemical industry. The Provincial Party Committee believes that Fujian is one of the main wood supply bases in southern China. With the high-speed development of socialist construction, while providing more logs to the country, it is necessary to fully utilize the previously discarded broken wood, small wood, shavings, etc., to manufacture fiberboard to widely replace wood and provide raw materials and materials for industrial production. According to the survey, the residual branches and waste materials discarded in my province every year can produce 600,000 tons of fiberboard, which can replace 3.4 million cubic meters of logs; calculated at 450 yuan per ton of fiberboard, the value is 270 million yuan; and one cubic meter of fiberboard can replace 5.7 cubic meters of logs, while producing one cubic meter of fiberboard only requires 3.3 cubic meters of waste materials and shavings. At the same time, the residual materials from logging and the wild plants all over the mountains can also be made into important raw materials and materials for industrial production such as aromatic oils, camphor oil, acetic acid, rosin, activated carbon, synthetic petroleum, alcohol, wood tar, rayon, and pulp. Therefore, developing forestry chemical industry on a large scale, mainly through comprehensive utilization of wood, is a faster, better, and more economical way to solve the current shortage of wood supply and provide important industrial raw materials. Fully utilizing abundant forest resources has also created very favorable conditions for the people's communes to further implement the policy of combining industry and agriculture, rapidly develop commune-run industries, expand the collective economy of the communes, and increase the income of the communes and commune members. After the Xiwei Commune Chemical Plant in Youxi County was established, it produced more than 1,800 kilograms of litsea cubeba oil in just over a month, increasing the commune's income by more than 30,000 yuan. The masses in the mountainous areas sang in a song: "Branches, bark, leaves, and roots, never utilized for thousands of years; the leadership of the Party is really good, comprehensive utilization creates wealth."

While strengthening propaganda and education among the masses and affirming that "comprehensive utilization of wood has great potential," it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to liberate their minds, eliminate the mystery of running forestry chemical industry, carry forward the communist style of daring to think and dare to do, and point out the correct direction and feasible methods. The Provincial Party Committee believes that to universally develop forestry chemical industry, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of "small scale as the main, indigenous methods first, indigenous methods first then foreign methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, from small to large, and gradually improving." At the same time, it is also necessary to emphasize the spirit of making use of local materials, self-reliance, simplicity, and diligence in running factories, and resolutely rely on the masses to overcome difficulties. When various localities conscientiously implemented the correct instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and fully mobilized the masses, the so-called difficulties such as insufficient labor, technology, and equipment were all quickly resolved. Most localities used old houses, dilapidated temples, and ancestral halls as factory buildings, which not only saved investment in factory construction, but also enabled rapid commissioning of production. The Daheng, Taiping, Xiadao, and Zhanghu communes in Nanping City used 178 rooms in 14 dilapidated temples to establish nearly 100 factories (workshops). Commune farm tool factories in various localities also manufactured a large number of indigenous hot presses, crushers, and pulpers, which basically solved the equipment difficulties in fiberboard production. Because of the lack of copper, aluminum, and seamless steel pipes for the equipment for producing tannin extract, the masses widely used basins, porcelain jars, earthen jars, and bamboo tubes instead. Generally speaking, it is possible to find local materials or substitutes to solve the equipment problems for building an indigenous fiberboard factory with an annual output of 25 tons and forestry chemical plants producing products such as tannin extract, pine root oil, and acetic acid, and it costs very little money and yields quick results. When manufacturing fiberboard, the Xiqin Forestry Chemical Plant in Nanping City used an indigenous guillotine instead of a crusher, used a wine press modified into a pre-press, and used a stone mill and water ram instead of a pulper. In the ten months after it was put into production, it produced 19 tons of fiberboard. Communes in various localities also adopted the method of combining year-round production and seasonal production to greatly exert the role of semi-labor and the elderly, women in running forestry chemical industry. Two small forestry chemical plants in Dongyou Commune, Jian'ou County, were engaged in year-round production by 16 male semi-laborers and women, and produced more than 13,000 kilograms of nanmu oil, camphor oil, etc., worth 25,000 yuan in the past ten months of last year.

Because large-scale forestry chemical production has formed a widespread mass movement, the technical innovation and technical revolution movements have also been vigorously launched, thereby improving work efficiency and product quality, greatly saving labor, and reducing costs. The Xiqin Commune Forestry Chemical Plant in Nanping City mentioned above established an indigenous-foreign-integrated fiberboard workshop on the basis of indigenous production, created a steel-wood structure slicer, pre-press, and pulper, and adopted a continuous drying furnace, which increased the annual output from the original 25 tons to 250 tons. Various localities have also universally used water and wind power as power to drive machinery to replace heavy manual labor such as manual crushing and pulping. The Chengdong Commune Farm Tool Factory in Yongding County adopted the hard mold casting method with multiple castings per mold, and Chong'an County adopted the pig iron sand casting annealing method to manufacture hot press plates, an important piece of equipment for producing fiberboard with smooth surfaces and excellent quality, which solved the difficulty of lacking steel plates. My province has also created the advanced experience of decomposing eight products such as gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil from pine root oil, and has successfully tested pine needle oil extraction, with 15 kilograms of oil extracted from every 100 kilograms of pine needles. In addition to being able to replace tung oil and lubricating oil, it can also be used as a raw material for making soap, and the pine needle cake after oil extraction is also a good feed for pigs.

The rapid emergence of such a vigorous development situation in forestry chemical industry, an emerging industry, in my province has once again made us deeply realize that strengthening the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for achieving victory in all undertakings. Our Provincial Party Committee resolutely implemented the instructions of the Central Committee and, according to the situation in our province, put forward specific guidelines and methods for developing forestry chemical industry, and strengthened ideological leadership over the broad masses. Party committees at all levels were also headed by secretaries in charge of forestry or industry, and established special agencies to lead and manage this work, and promoted advanced experience through on-site meetings and the establishment of benchmarks. At the same time, local party committees also organized various departments in the region to carry out communist collaboration in the construction and production of forestry chemical industry, and rushed to manufacture various technical equipment for forestry chemical plants in various localities, thereby smoothly solving many specific difficulties. We firmly believe that as long as we strengthen the Party's leadership, resolutely rely on the masses, and launch mass movements on a large scale, the forestry chemical industry in our province will surely leap into a new and higher stage of development.

Please correct the above speech, fellow delegates. (Attached picture)

### 土洋并举大搞木材综合利用  侯振亚代表的发言

专栏：

    土洋并举大搞木材综合利用
    侯振亚代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理和人大常委会的工作报告。李富春副总理在报告中提出要“尽可能实行……木材的综合利用”，现在我就这个问题作一个发言。
    木材是国家建设中的一项重要物资。不仅在基本建设上大量需要。同时还可以加以综合利用制造出许多工业生产建设上所需要的原料、材料。在大跃进的两年来，我省虽然为国家供应了大量原木，但是采伐下来的木材并没有完全得到合理的利用。从木材的采伐到加工成材，抛弃了大量的树枝、树叶、树皮、木头、木尾、木屑等，木材的实际利用率只占百分之六十。而抛弃的却是可以作为林产化工生产的原料。我省除了现有木材积蓄量可资长期采伐利用外，还有一千二百多种可以制造纤维、单宁、油料、淀粉和药品等的野生植物，加以我省气候温和，植物生长期长，林地更新快，以及水力、风力等动力资源丰富等有利条件，这就使我省拥有取之不尽用之不竭的资源，完全可以多快好省地发展林产化工生产。
      中共福建省委分析了上述的情况以后，肯定“木材综合利用大有可为”，并专门为此发了指示，号召全省人民解放思想，以大炼钢铁的劲头，大搞木材综合利用，大办林产化工厂。省委第一书记叶飞同志也亲自深入林区、工厂进行检查，作了许多重要的指示，责成各级党委加强对这一工作的领导，随之在全省范围内掀起了全民大办林产化工厂的群众运动。从林区到沿海，从农村到城市，普遍办起了小型的林产化工厂、不仅国营伐木场和公社的大队、生产队办，各机关、部队、学校、城市街道也办，使林产化工很快地出现了一个遍地开花的新局面。到今年三月下旬止，全省已建成各种不同规模的小型林产化工厂七千一百五十多个（其中公社、大队办的占9％），并已普遍开始生产纤维板、栲胶、胶合板、刨花板、厚纸板、芳香油、人造棉、活性炭等二十多种林产化工产品，光是全省二百零八个小土群纤维板厂，在今年两个多月中就为国家生产了五十二吨多纤维板。
    我省在大办林产化工运动中，坚持了“两条腿走路”的方针，即采取国家与公社同时发展的办法，一方面充分发挥人民公社的巨大优越性，使小土群林产化工厂花开遍地；另一方面积极部署和重点建立了比较具有规模的国营小洋群林产化工厂作为骨干。目前，福州木材综合利用加工厂年产二千吨的纤维板车间、南平西芹、龙岩、漳州各年产六百吨的纤维板厂都已建成（此外还将兴建一千个年产纤维板六十吨、烤胶三十吨的大土群林产化工厂）。这些厂的设备较好、产品种类较多，并有一定的技术力量，这就给小土群的发展树立了标兵，指出了方向，并且还能挂钩协作，解决一些技术上的问题和培训技术力量。而小土群所创造出来的丰富经验，又反过来促进小洋群的发展。因此，这一批小洋群林产化工厂的建成和投入生产，不仅将迅速增加产品产量和提高质量，更将为我省林产化工事业从土到洋的发展打下初步基础。
    我省于1958年开始搞林产化工生产，但在过去一年多的时间，基本上只是停留于某些地方的试办阶段。林产化工在当时所以不能迅速普遍在全省展开，主要是由于右倾保守思想的障碍。人们对于兴办这一事业的重要性和可能性缺乏认识，因此，总是强调劳力不足、技术不懂、设备缺乏等等的困难。所以，必须首先打破思想障碍，才能给林产化工开辟广泛发展的道路。省委认为，福建是我国南方木材主要供应基地之一，随着社会主义建设事业的高速度发展，为国家提供更多原木的同时，必须把历来所废弃的碎木、梢木、刨花等充分加以利用，以制造纤维板广泛代替木材和提供工业生产的原料、材料。根据调查，我省每年抛弃的残枝废料，可以生产六十万吨纤维板，能顶替三百四十万立方米原木使用；每吨纤维板以四百五十元计算，价值二亿七千万元；而一立方米纤维板，能顶替五点七立方米原木，生产一立方米纤维板却只需要三点三立方米废材碎料。同时，采伐木材的残料和遍山的野生植物，还可以制成芳香油、漳脑油、醋石、松香、活性炭、人造石油、酒精、木焦油、人造棉、纸浆等工业生产的重要原料、材料。因此，以木材综合利用为主大搞林产化工，是解决当前木材供应不足和提供重要工业原料的多快好省的办法。丰富的森林资源加以充分利用，又为人民公社进一步贯彻工农业并举的方针，迅速发展社办工业，扩大公社集体经济，增加公社和社员收入创造了十分有利的条件。尤溪县溪尾公社化工厂办起后一个多月时间，就生产了山苍子油一千八百多斤，为公社增加了三万多元的收入。山区群众编歌唱道：“枝木、板皮、叶和根，千年万载没利用；党的领导真正好，综合利用创财宝”。
    在加强对群众进行宣传教育，肯定“木材综合利用大有可为”之时，还必须发动群众解放思想，破除兴办林产化工事业的神秘感，发扬敢想敢做的共产主义风格，并指出正确的方针和可行的办法。省委认为普遍发展林产化工，必须坚决贯彻“小型为主，土法上马，先土后洋，土洋并举，从小到大，逐步提高”的方针，同时还必须强调本着就地取材、自力更生、因陋就简和勤俭办厂的精神，坚决依靠群众克服困难。当各地认真贯彻了省委的正确指示，把群众充分发动起来以后，所谓劳力不足、技术、设备等等困难问题，就都迅速得到了解决。各地大多是利用旧房、破庙和祠堂来做厂房，既节省了建厂投资，又可迅速投入生产。南平市的大横、太平、夏道和樟湖四个公
  社，就利用十四个破庙的一百七十八间房，建立了近百个厂（车间）。各地公社农具厂还大量制造了土热压机、切碎机、打浆机等，基本解决了纤维板生产的设备困难。生产烤胶的设备由于缺乏铜、铝和无缝钢管，群众就广泛采用脸盆、瓷缸、瓦罐、竹管来代替。一般说来，用土法建一个年产二十五吨的纤维板厂，以及生产烤胶、松根油、醋石等产品的林产化工厂，都可以就地取材或找到代用品，解决设备问题，并且花钱很少，收效很快。南平市西芹林产化工厂在制造纤维板时，用土铡刀代替轧碎机，用制酒压榨器改装成预压器，用石磨、水碓代替打浆机，在投入生产后的十个月中，就生产了纤维板十九吨。各地公社还采取常年生产与季节性生产相结合的办法，大大发挥了半劳力和老人、妇女在兴办林产化工事业中的作用。建瓯县东游公社的两个小型林产化工厂，由十六个男半劳力和妇女进行常年生产，在去年的十个月中就生产了楠木油、樟脑油等一万三千多斤，产值达二万五千元。
    由于大搞林产化工生产形成了广泛的群众运动，技术革新和技术革命运动也随之蓬勃开展起来，因而提高了工效和产品质量，大大节省了劳力，降低了成本。上面讲到的南平市西芹公社林产化工厂，在土法生产的基础上，建立了一个土洋结合的纤维板车间，创造了铁木结构的切片机、预压机、打浆机，采用连续式的烘干炉，使年产量由原来的二十五吨提高到二百五十吨。各地还普遍利用水力、风力做动力带动机械，以代替人工切碎、打浆等繁重的体力劳动。永定县陈东公社农具厂采用一模多铸的硬模铸炼法，崇安县采用生铁翻砂退火铸炼法，都制造出版面平滑、质量优良的生产纤维板的重要设备——热压板，解决了缺乏钢板的困难。我省还创造了从松根油中分解出汽油、煤油、柴油等八种产品的先进经验，并试验成功了松针榨油，每百斤松针可榨出十五斤油，除能代替桐油、润滑油外，还可作制肥皂的原料，榨过油的松针饼，又是养猪的好饲料。
    林产化工这一新兴的事业，在我省迅速出现如此蓬勃发展的局面，使我们又一次深刻地体会到加强党的领导是取得一切事业胜利的根本保证。我们省委坚决执行了中央的指示，并根据我省情况，提出了发展林产化工的具体方针和办法，加强了对广大群众的思想领导。各级党委也都由分管林业或工业的书记挂帅，成立了专门的机构领导和管理这一工作，并通过现场会议，树立标兵，推广先进经验。同时各地党委还组织了本地区各部门对林产化工的建设和生产实行共产主义大协作，为各地林产化工厂赶制了各种技术设备，从而顺利地解决了许多具体困难。我们坚信，只要加强党的领导，坚决依靠群众，大搞群众运动，我省林产化工事业就一定会跃入一个新的更高的发展阶段。
    以上发言，请各位代表指正。（附图片）
