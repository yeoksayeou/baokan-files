    Liuzhou Machinery Factory – A Red Banner of Guangxi
    Xiao Han, First Secretary of the Liuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    The Liuzhou Machinery Factory in Guangxi was originally a small factory that could only manufacture simple agricultural tools. Because the factory's employees had great ambitions, dared to think and act, and constantly climbed the peak of production technology, it rapidly developed into a modern enterprise capable of producing many advanced products in batches, becoming a red banner of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Recently, it also won the "Leap Forward Red Banner" award in the national machinery industry system. – Editor
    The Liuzhou Machinery Factory in Guangxi is a factory with great ambitions. Under conditions of insufficient equipment and weak technical strength, it not only produced small, precision gasoline engines and heavy-duty mechanical equipment such as five-ton bridge cranes and 250 mm steel rolling mills, but also produced the "6135" high-speed diesel engine, whose performance and precision are among the world's advanced levels. Recently, it has also begun small-batch production of the "Red River" brand paddy field tractor suitable for rice paddy cultivation conditions in southern China, thereby rapidly developing a small factory that could only produce simple agricultural tools into a modern enterprise capable of manufacturing "high-grade, large, precision, advanced, and new" products. This is a remarkable change.
    Breaking Superstition and Liberating Thought are the Keys to Creating Miracles in the Great Leap Forward
    The fundamental reason for the Liuzhou Machinery Factory's achievements in a few short years is that the factory's employees, under the leadership and education of the Party, have developed the Chinese working class's ambition to catch up and strive to rapidly change the backward situation, and the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, not fearing difficulties, and daring to climb the peak of production technology. Whenever the state requires them to produce a new product, no matter how great the difficulties, they bravely take on the task. In the second half of 1953, the leadership assigned them the task of trial-producing a small, precision gasoline engine. They broke the superstition that "foreign countries can do it, but we can't because our conditions are poor," and successfully completed this task. The "6135" high-speed diesel engine is the latest type of product in China. But they firmly believed that "since the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory can make it, we can make it too," and finally succeeded. The paddy field tractor is an even more cutting-edge technology product. But the workers firmly believed that since the factory had manufactured large, precision, high-speed diesel engines, with a little more effort, they would definitely be able to make tractors. Facts have proved that they not only made them, but they also made them very well. The experience of the Liuzhou Machinery Factory once again proves that only by breaking superstition can the proletariat gain spiritual liberation, can it implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, and achieve the Great Leap Forward. This is an irrefutable truth. Daring to think what others dare not think, daring to do what others dare not do, constantly breaking superstition, and constantly liberating thought are the precursors for the Liuzhou Machinery Factory to climb from one peak to another higher peak and constantly create miracles.
    Having Great Ambitions, Daring to Think and Act, but Also Treating Difficulties Carefully
    However, this proletarian ambition and communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, like all new things, do not grow and expand smoothly, but are full of fierce struggles between two ideologies, two lines, and two methods. Whether or not to dare and have the courage to accept the task of trial-producing new products is not a general question, but a question of breaking superstition, liberating thought, and daring to climb peaks, or of belittling oneself, not seeking progress, and admitting defeat; a question of adhering to high speed and rapid progress, or of being a small-footed woman and taking things slowly; facing many difficulties, a question of despising difficulties and moving forward bravely, or of being frightened by difficulties and standing still, a question of actively creating conditions and overcoming difficulties with poor methods, or of waiting passively and being a hand-out. These are all struggles between proletarian heroes and cowards, lazybones, and all conservatives, struggles between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview. The Liuzhou Machinery Factory Party Committee has always firmly stood on the side of the Party's correct line, insisted on putting politics in command, vigorously carried out mass movements, stood at the forefront of mass movements, and carried out irreconcilable struggles against all kinds of "theory of conditions" and superstition. They also fully utilized Chairman Mao's thought of "despising the enemy strategically and taking the enemy seriously tactically," combining soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis, and combining daring to think and act with seeking truth from facts. On the one hand, they educated workers to establish great ambitions to climb the peak of production technology, and on the other hand, they closely relied on the endless wisdom of the vast workers and treated difficulties without any carelessness. For example, when trial-producing paddy field tractors, they encountered a series of complex technical problems and lacked precision special equipment and many advanced alloy materials. However, they neither retreated in the face of these difficulties nor acted rashly, but launched a mass technical innovation movement throughout the factory, launching a general offensive against the difficulties. Without special equipment, they made it themselves; lacking equipment and materials, they relied on their own efforts to find solutions; not understanding the technology, they studied hard and learned from others with an open mind. With this spirit of daring to think and act strategically and treating difficulties meticulously tactically, they finally overcame many cutting-edge technologies. From the miracles created by the Liuzhou Machinery Factory, we once again see how great a role the subjective initiative of the people plays in socialist construction. We deeply feel that as long as we resolutely implement the Party's general line for building socialism and fully develop the subjective initiative of the workers, we will be able to continuously achieve more brilliant results.
    All Employees in the City are Determined to Climb the Peak of Technology
    The proletarian ambition and the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act are the characteristics of the spiritual outlook of the Chinese working class, and also the lofty manifestation of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In the Great Leap Forward in the two consecutive years of 1958 and 1959, under the constant advocacy of the Municipal Party Committee, the communist style of the Liuzhou Machinery Factory of having great ambitions, setting high goals, and daring to think, speak, and act has developed into a common style in large and small factories in Liuzhou. Building Liuzhou into a modern industrial base of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is an extremely arduous and glorious task entrusted to us by the state, and it also brings us great hope and tremendous encouragement. The people of the city, gathered under the banner of the Party's general line for socialist construction, have initially established the foundation of a modern industrial base in Liuzhou after more than two years of hard work and skillful work. In the first year of the sixties, we are determined to double industrial production, build key industrial projects, and take a decisive step towards becoming a modern industrial city. In order to realize this ambitious goal, all employees are continuing to break superstition, liberate their minds, and carry out a city-wide mass technical innovation movement to promote the mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation of manual operations. In this great and significant torrent of the technological revolution, all employees in the city further promoted the style of the Liuzhou Machinery Factory of climbing the peak of technology without fear of difficulties and obstacles, and with the determination of "the poorer we are, the more revolutionary we are, the more native we are, the more innovative we are, the smaller the factory, the greater the ambition, and the more vigorously we attack automation," they overcame numerous difficulties and created many extraordinary miracles. The Liuzhou City Vermicelli Factory is a manual workshop organized by dozens of individual manual laborers. Now, under extremely rudimentary equipment conditions, they have automated the entire production process from grinding tips, steaming flour, folding flour to cutting flour. The Liuzhou City Paper Mill was also originally a manual workshop. Now, they have also built an automatic production line from feeding, pulping, sending pulp, papermaking, drying paper to finished products through self-reliance, which is praised as "even chicken feathers can fly to the sky." In just forty days, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the city has increased from 55% to more than 75%, and twenty factories have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization, and many automatic production lines and automated operation lines have appeared. A technological revolution storm of "everyone is of one mind, all horses gallop, all flowers bloom, and all things are renewed" has brought a new high tide of greater leap forward to the industrial production, capital construction, and transportation in this emerging industrial city in southern China.
    Drawing the Newest and Most Beautiful Pictures on a Blank Sheet of Paper
    Due to historical reasons, the original industrial base of our Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region was relatively backward. However, backwardness is not terrible. As Chairman Mao said: "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, the desire to work, and the desire for revolution. A blank sheet of paper has no burden and is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words and for drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures." Therefore, vigorously advocating and constantly developing the style of having great ambitions, setting high goals, and developing grand plans is of particular significance for accelerating the socialist construction of Guangxi.
    We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Regional Party Committee, holding high the banner of the Party's general line for socialist construction, holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, having great ambitions, setting high goals, and constantly climbing the peak of production technology, we will certainly be able to accelerate the construction of the Liuzhou industrial base and draw the newest and most beautiful picture on the land of the rich and beautiful Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

    柳州机械厂——广西的一面红旗
    中共柳州市委第一书记　萧寒
    广西柳州机械厂是一个原来只能制造简单农具的小工厂。由于这个厂的职工有雄心大志，敢想敢干，不断攀登生产技术高峰，终于迅速发展成能够成批生产不少高级产品的现代化企业，成为广西僮族自治区的一面红旗，最近又获得了全国机械工业系统的“跃进红旗”奖。　·编者·
    广西柳州机械厂是一个有雄心壮志的工厂。在设备不足和技术力量薄弱的条件下，它不仅生产了小型精密的汽油机和五吨桥式电动吊车、二百五十公厘轧钢机等重型的机械设备，还生产了在性能及精密度都列入世界先进水平的“6135”型高速柴油机。最近又开始小批生产了适合我国南方水田耕作条件的“红河”牌水田拖拉机，从而使一个只能生产简单农具的小工厂迅速发展为能够制造“高、大、精、尖、新”产品的现代化企业。这是一个了不起的变化。
    破除迷信解放思想才能创奇迹大跃进
    柳州机械厂在短短几年内取得这些成绩的根本原因是，这个厂的职工在党的领导和教育下，发扬了中国工人阶级不甘落后、力争迅速改变落后面貌的雄心壮志，和敢想敢说敢干，不畏艰难，敢于攀登生产技术高峰的共产主义风格。每当国家要求他们生产一项新产品的时候，不管困难有多大，他们都勇敢地承担下来。1953年下半年领导上交给了他们试制小型精密汽油发动机的任务。他们打破了“国外能做，我们条件差不能做”的迷信，很好地完成了这个任务；“6135”型高速柴油机是国内最新式的产品。但是他们坚信“既然上海柴油机厂能够做出来，我们也能做出来”终于做成了；水田拖拉机更是一种属于尖端技术水平的新产品。但是职工们坚信工厂既然把大型精密的高速柴油机制造出来，再加一把劲，也一定会把拖拉机造出来。事实证明，他们不仅造了出来，而且造得很好。柳州机械厂的经验又一次证明，只有破除迷信，无产阶级才能获得精神上的解放，才能贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，实现大跃进。这是一条颠扑不破的真理。敢于想别人不敢想的、敢于做别人不敢做的，不断地破除迷信，不断地解放思想，是柳州机械厂由一个高峰攀上另一个更高峰，不断创造奇迹的先导。
    树雄心大志敢想敢干又要细致地对待困难
    但是，这种无产阶级的雄心壮志和敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，如同所有的新生事物一样，它们的成长和壮大，并不是一帆风顺，而是充满着两种思想、两种路线和两种方法的激烈斗争的。敢不敢和有没有胆量接受试制新产品的任务，不是一个一般的问题，而是破除迷信，解放思想，敢于攀登高峰，还是妄自菲薄，不求上进，甘拜下风的问题；是坚持高速度、快马加鞭，还是小脚女人，慢慢来的问题；面对着许多艰险困难，是藐视困难，勇往直前，还是为困难所吓倒，裹足不前，是积极创造条件，用穷办法克服困难，还是消极等待，当伸手派。这些都是无产阶级英雄好汉和懦夫、懒汉及一切保守派的斗争，是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的斗争。柳州机械厂党委始终坚定地站在党的正确路线方面，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，站在群众运动的最前线，和一切形形色色的“唯条件论”、迷信派开展了不调和的斗争。他们又充分发挥了毛主席“在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人”的思想，把冲天干劲和科学分析结合起来，把敢想敢干和实事求是结合起来。他们一方面教育职工树立攀登生产技术高峰的雄心壮志，一方面紧紧依靠广大职工无穷无尽的智慧，一点不马虎地对待困难。例如在试制水田拖拉机的时候，曾经碰到了一系列的复杂的技术难题，而且缺乏精密的专用设备和许多高级合金材料。但是，他们既没有在这些困难面前退缩，也不轻率从事，而是在全厂范围内大搞群众性的技术革新运动，向困难展开了总攻势。没有专用设备，自己动手制造；缺少设备和材料，自力更生想办法解决；不懂技术，刻苦钻研，虚心向别人学习。他们凭着这种在战略上敢想敢干，在战术上一丝不苟对待困难的精神，终于攻克了许多尖端技术。从柳州机械厂创造的奇迹中，我们再一次看到，在社会主义建设中，人民群众的主观能动性有多么大的作用。我们深深感到只要坚决贯彻执行党的建设社会主义总路线，充分发挥职工群众的主观能动性，我们就能够不断地取得更辉煌的成绩。
    全市职工决心攀登技术高峰
    无产阶级的雄心壮志，和敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，是我们中国工人阶级精神面貌的特征，也是党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的崇高表现。在1958年和1959年连续两年的大跃进中，在市委不断的倡导下，柳州机械厂这种树雄心，立大志，敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，已经发展成为柳州市大小工厂普遍的风尚。把柳州市建设成为广西僮族自治区的现代化工业基地，是国家交给我们的一个极其艰巨而又光荣的任务，同时也给我们带来了伟大的希望和巨大的鼓舞。全市人民汇集在党的社会主义建设总路线的旗帜下，经过两年多的苦干和巧干，柳州市已经初步建立起现代化工业基地的基础。在六十年代的第一年里，我们立志要实现工业生产翻一番，把重点工业项目建设起来，向现代化的工业城市迈出决定性的一步。为了实现这个雄心壮志，全部职工正在继续破除迷信，解放思想，在全市范围内开展全民性的大搞手工操作的机械化半机械化和自动化半自动化的技术革新运动。在这个具有伟大意义的技术革命的洪流里，全市职工进一步发扬了柳州机械厂不避艰难险阻攀登技术高峰的风格，抱着“越穷越革命，越土越革新，厂小志气大，猛攻自动化”的决心，克服重重困难，创造出许多异乎寻常的奇迹。柳州市粉丝厂是一个由几十户个体手工劳动者组织起来的手工作坊。现在，他们在设备极其简陋的情况下，已经使磨尖、蒸粉、叠粉到切粉全部生产过程实现了自动化。柳州市造纸厂原来也是一个手工作坊。现在，他们也自力更生，建成一条从投料、打浆、送浆、抄纸、烘纸到成品的自动生产线，被人们誉称为“鸡毛飞上了天”。在短短的四十天里，全市机械化半机械化程度已由55％提高到75％以上，有二十个工厂基本实现了机械化和半机械化，并且出现了许多生产自动线、自动化作业线。一个“万众一心，万马奔腾，万紫千红，万象更新”的技术革命的风暴，使祖国南方这个新兴工业城市的工业生产、基本建设、交通运输都出现了更大跃进的新高潮。
    在白纸上画最新最美的画图
    由于历史的原因，我们广西僮族自治区原来的工业基础比较落后。但是，落后并不可怕。正如毛主席所说的：“穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图”。因此，大力地提倡和不断地发扬树雄心，立大志，展宏图的风格，对于加速广西的社会主义建设特别有着重大的意义。
    我们坚信，在区党委的领导下，高举党的社会主义建设总路线的旗帜，高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，树雄心，立大志，不断攀登生产技术高峰，我们就一定能够加速柳州工业基地的建设，在富饶美丽的广西僮族自治区的土地上，画上一幅最新最美的画图。
