Chairman, fellow committee members:

I wholeheartedly endorse Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 at the National People's Congress meeting, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national final accounts and the 1960 draft national budget. As an educator, I am greatly encouraged and educated by these reports, and I resolutely respond to this great call.

Since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, both industry and agriculture have experienced rapid development, and education has also made a great leap forward. Taking higher education in Guangdong as an example, in the past two years, the number of institutions of higher learning has increased from less than ten to more than forty. After the education revolution and the implementation of the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, there has been not only tremendous development in quantity but also great changes and improvements in quality.

**The Motherland's Brilliant Achievements Inspire Overseas Chinese**

These brilliant achievements have greatly inspired overseas Chinese. We know that overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have always suffered from the heavy oppression and exploitation of imperialists. Under the rule of feudal dynasties and reactionaries, they became overseas orphans. Now that the motherland is becoming increasingly strong and its construction is leaping forward, this has opened up broad avenues for returned overseas Chinese and students to find employment and education. As a result, more and more overseas Chinese are returning to the country to participate in socialist construction, especially the children of overseas Chinese, who are returning to study in even greater numbers. In addition to establishing overseas Chinese supplementary schools in Beijing, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other places, the Party and the People's Government have also established some primary and secondary schools and universities that mainly enroll children of overseas Chinese, such as Jinan University in Guangzhou and overseas Chinese middle and primary schools in various parts of Guangdong, so that a large number of returned overseas Chinese students not only have schools to enter upon their return but also receive appropriate and meticulous care.

Recently, in some countries in Southeast Asia, due to the instigation of a few reactionaries and imperialists, especially U.S. imperialists, a counter-current of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment has emerged. For several months, this counter-current has been developing in Indonesia, so the number of returned overseas Chinese and students has been particularly large. Therefore, the education of returned overseas Chinese students has become a special and urgent problem to be solved. I would like to briefly report to the members here on some of the situations and problems I understand.

First of all, it should be pointed out that the Party and the People's Government attach great importance to the issue of overseas Chinese children returning to China for further education. The overseas Chinese affairs committees and the staff responsible for receiving and settling returned overseas Chinese are doing a very good job in their specific work. I recall how difficult it was for many returned overseas Chinese students like myself to return to China for further education during the reactionary Northern Warlord and Kuomintang rule. Parents were very worried about their children traveling across the ocean to return to China. What they were most worried about was the poor public security under the reactionary government. It was not easy to be admitted to a school after returning to China, and they were often likely to be deceived or even abducted. Moreover, many schools were poorly run, and after entering school, they not only could not learn anything but often learned bad habits.

What about today? Not only have many primary and secondary schools and supplementary schools been established in the country to settle them, but ships have also been sent to Southeast Asia to welcome them. This is something that overseas Chinese students who returned to China for further education two or three decades ago could never have dreamed of. I have attended several conferences in Guangzhou to welcome overseas Chinese and students. Many overseas Chinese students deeply felt the warmth of the motherland as soon as they stepped onto the ships dispatched by the motherland. The food for three meals a day was shipped from the motherland, and if they got sick, there were Chinese doctors on board to treat them. If they were cold, they were provided with sanitary clothing and cotton clothing. Within a week of returning to China, hundreds and thousands of overseas Chinese students were quickly and properly arranged and assigned to schools in Beijing, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other places according to their wishes. In school, not only did teachers and classmates provide meticulous help in their studies, but those with financial difficulties at home were given subsidies. One overseas Chinese student said that the Party was even kinder and more caring to returned overseas Chinese students than their own parents.

**Several Issues Worth Noting in Overseas Chinese Students' Return to Study**

However, there are also some problems with overseas Chinese students returning to study, which can be discussed from three aspects: living habits, cultural and academic studies, and political studies.

First of all, we must point out that political study is very important for returned overseas Chinese students. Overseas Chinese students are born and raised overseas and deeply hate the oppression and exploitation of local people and overseas Chinese by imperialists in Southeast Asia. However, because they have been deeply influenced by capitalist and imperialist ideology and culture for a long time, they do not understand or even misunderstand the Party's education policy of combining education with productive labor in the motherland, which has undergone tremendous changes after ten years of liberation. Therefore, their ideological education is particularly important. In the past, many overseas Chinese schools have done a lot of work in this regard. Now, more and more overseas Chinese students are returning to the country, and many of them are forced to return by foreign reactionaries. This has further aroused their patriotic enthusiasm and promoted the unity of overseas Chinese and students, which is more conducive to strengthening ideological education. I believe that in addition to large and small political reports, special attention should be paid to the ideological problems of individual overseas Chinese students.

As for cultural and academic studies, the problems are more numerous and complex. We know that before World War II, the countries in Southeast Asia were all oppressed by colonialists. Colonialists have always attached little importance to the education of the people they enslave. Even if they run some schools, their purpose is only to serve the colonialists, which is a slave education. In the schools they set up, many subjects such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry are often not taught. Even if they are, they are often nominal. Their purpose is only to train junior staff or translators and compradors for foreign firms. This is an education that follows a different path from the education in our motherland today.

As for schools established by overseas Chinese, they are subject to great restrictions. For example, in Thailand, about thirty years ago, various methods began to be used to restrict overseas Chinese schools. Overseas Chinese schools were originally taught in Chinese, but restrictions were gradually strengthened, and Chinese was treated as a foreign language course, with only five or six hours a week. Teachers from China were strictly prohibited from going there, and in the local area, not only were there no institutions of higher learning run by overseas Chinese (Nanyang University in Singapore was only established after 1950), but the local government also rarely established institutions of higher learning. Therefore, there is a great lack of teachers. Many schools use middle school graduates to teach middle school students. Therefore, the cultural and academic level of students is relatively low. After these overseas Chinese students return to China, if the tutoring time in supplementary schools is too short, it is difficult to consolidate the foundation. However, if the tutoring time is too long, it is easy to make them lose confidence in learning.

As for some overseas Chinese students who only read foreign languages and do not understand Chinese at all, the problem is more complicated. For example, some have graduated from foreign language middle schools. After returning to China, because they do not understand Chinese at all, they have to start from scratch, which means they have to study from the primary school or equivalent grade. Although they are full of energy and strive to complete primary and secondary school in a short period of time, it is not easy to complete six years of middle school and six years of primary school, a total of twelve years, in two or three years. If the tutoring time is too long, it is easy to become overage students. For these students, for example, those who originally studied English, should they be assigned to the English Department of the university? Those who originally studied the languages of Southeast Asian countries, should they be assigned to the Department of Oriental Languages in Peking University? At the same time, should their courses in the university be appropriately reduced so that they can have more time to study Chinese? This is a question worth considering.

In terms of daily life, because almost all parts of Southeast Asia are in the tropics, there is a big difference from the situation in China, especially in northern China. One example is that they take a bath two or three times a day in Southeast Asia. Although this is a minor detail of life, it is still a problem for overseas Chinese students who have just returned from the tropics. These overseas Chinese students have grown up or spent their entire lives in Southeast Asia and have rarely or never returned to China. At the same time, they have been deeply influenced by bourgeois education and culture for a long time. After returning to China, on the one hand, they feel the warmth of the motherland and the meticulous care of the Party and the People's Government for them. But on the other hand, they feel that there are many differences between the way of life in China and what they have experienced in Southeast Asia. How to enable them to quickly adapt to this new society and new life is also a problem that deserves attention.

It should be pointed out that although some of the problems mentioned above deserve attention, they are not difficult to solve. I remember that last year, for example, some overseas Chinese students were very agitated when they heard that they had to go to the countryside to work. They said, "We are returning to China to study, not to do 'hard labor'." But after the school leaders, teachers, and classmates explained the Party's education policy, they were not only willing to do it but also did it very enthusiastically. There were quite a few activists among the overseas Chinese students on the construction site. In terms of academic performance, many overseas Chinese students have also made rapid progress. In recent years, the percentage of overseas Chinese students who passed the entrance examination for institutions of higher learning has also been very high. Therefore, as long as the ideological education work is done well, they will transform quickly and make rapid progress.

In short, the return of overseas Chinese and students to the motherland is welcomed by the people of the whole country, especially when the great socialist construction of the motherland is developing rapidly and requires more manpower and technical talents. The more overseas Chinese return to the country for employment and the more overseas Chinese students return to the country for further education, the better. Although we have raised some problems existing in overseas Chinese students returning to study above, as long as ideological education is done well, as long as politics takes command, the problems existing in academic studies and living habits will be easily solved. In this way, we believe that these young generations who have returned to the embrace of the motherland from overseas will certainly be able to make outstanding achievements on the front line of the great socialist construction in the near future.

    关于归国侨生的教育问题
    陈序经委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我衷心拥护陈叔通副主席所作的全国政协常务委员会工作报告和全国人民代表大会会议上李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，及李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。我是一个教育工作者，听了之后，受到很大的鼓舞与教育，并且坚决的响应这个伟大的号召。
    解放后，在党与毛主席的英明领导之下，无论在工业方面或是农业方面，都有飞跃的发展，至于教育方面，也同样的大跃进。以广东的高等教育来说，这两年来，从不够十所的高等学校增加到四十多所。经过教育革命与执行党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针之后，不只在量的方面有了巨大的发展，就是在质的方面，也有了很大的变化提高。
    祖国的辉煌成就鼓舞着海外侨胞
    这种辉煌的成就，对于海外的侨胞来说，更引起极大的鼓舞。我们知道，东南亚的侨胞，一向遭受帝国主义者的重重压迫与剥削。在封建王朝与反动派的统治之下，他们成为海外孤儿。现在，祖国日益强大了，建设事业，跃进而又跃进，这也为归国华侨和侨生就业就学开辟广阔的道路，因而海外侨胞，回国参加社会主义建设的，也愈来愈多，尤其是华侨子弟，回国求学的，为数更多。党与人民政府，除在北京广州厦门等处设立华侨补习学校之外，还开办一些主要吸收华侨子弟的大中小学，如广州的暨南大学，广东各地的华侨中学与华侨小学，使大量归国的侨生，不只回国即有学校可入，而且得到适当与无微不至的照顾。
    最近，在东南亚的一些国家中，由于少数反动分子与帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者的挑拨离间，掀起一股反华排华的逆流。数个月来，这种逆流，在印度尼西亚，现在仍在发展中，所以回国的侨胞与侨生，也特别的多。因而归国侨生的教育问题，也成为一个特殊而急需解决的问题。我愿意在这里把我所了解的一些情况，与一些问题，向各位委员作简略的汇报。
    首先，应该指出，党与人民政府对于华侨子弟回国升学这个问题，是十分重视的。各地侨委会与接待和安置归国华侨的工作人员，在具体工作上，是做得十分妥当。我回忆在反动的北洋军阀与国民党统治时期，像我一样的好多归国侨生，回国升学，是一件多么困难的事情。做父母的对于侨生回国，跋涉重洋，就很不放心，他们所最担心的是，在反动政府统治下，治安不良，回国之后，考入学校，固不容易，而且往往可能被人欺骗，以至拐走。何况，许多学校，办理不好，入校之后，既不见得能学到什么东西，反而往往学坏了。
    今天呢？不只在国内设立了好多大中小学和补习学校去安置他们，而且派船到东南亚去迎接他们，这是我们在二三十年前回国求学的侨生，所绝不能梦想得到的事情。我在广州参加好几次迎接侨胞侨生的大会，好多侨生一踏上祖国所派遣的轮船，就深深感觉到祖国的温暖。一日三餐的食品，是从祖国运去的，病了船上有我国医生医治，冷了有卫生衣、棉衣供给。回国后不够一星期，成百成千的侨生都迅速的得到妥善的安排，依照他们的志愿，分配到北京、广州、厦门等学校中去。在学校中不只在学习方面老师与同学无微不至的帮助，家庭经济困难的，给与补助金。有一个侨生这样说，党对于归国侨生比之亲生父母还要亲切慈祥。
    侨生回国求学中值得注意的几个问题
    但是侨生回国求学，也不是完全没有问题的，这可以从生活习惯、文化业务学习、政治学习三方面来说。
    首先，我们要指出，对于归国侨生来说，政治学习，是十分重要的。华侨学生在海外出生和成长，对于帝国主义者在东南亚对当地人民与华侨的压迫和剥削，是十分痛恨的。但回时，因为长期深受资本主义和帝国主义思想与文化的影响，回到解放已经十年而起了巨大变化的祖国，尤其是对于党的教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针，是不够了解甚至是有误解的，因而他们的思想教育，就显得特别重要。过去好多侨校对于这种工作，已作得很多，现在回国的侨生愈来愈多，其中有不少是被国外反动派逼迫回来的，这样，更激起了他们的爱国热情，更促进华侨和侨生的团结，这样对加强思想教育更为有利。我以为除了大型与小型的政治报告之外，尤要注意到个别侨生的思想问题。
    至于文化业务学习方面，问题也比较的多而复杂。我们知道在第二次世界战争之前，东南亚的国家中，都是受了殖民主义者的压迫。殖民主义者对于其所奴役的人民的教育，一向就不重视。就是办了一些学校，其目的只是为了殖民主义者服务，是奴化的教育。在他们所设立的学校里，对于好多科目如数理化等，往往就没有讲授。就是有了，也多是有名无实。他们的目的只是培养出低级职员或翻译员与洋奴——洋行买办。这与我们祖国今天的教育来说，是两条不同路线的教育。
    至于华侨所设立的学校，又受了很大的限制。比方在泰国，约三十年前，就开始用各式各样的方法去限制华侨学校。华侨学校本来是用中文讲授的，可是逐渐加强限制，却把中文当为外文课程，每周只能有五六小时的时间。教师之从我国国内之到该处的，严格禁止，而在当地，不只华侨所办的，没有高等学校（新嘉坡的南洋大学，是在1950年以后才办的），就是当地政府，也少设立高等学校。因而，师资十分缺乏。有好多学校，用中学毕业生去教中学生。所以学生的文化业务水平比较低。这些侨生，回国以后，入了补习学校，补习时间，若是太短，基础还是难于巩固，可是补习时间若太长了，又很容易使他们失了学习信心。
    至于一些只读外文，完全不懂中文的侨生，问题更为复杂。比方有的已在外文中学毕业，回国以后，因为完全不懂中文，要从头读起，这就是说要从小学或等于小学的年级学习，他们虽然鼓足干劲，争取在短期中读完小学与中学，可是六年中学，六年小学，共十二年，也不容易在两三年内读完。假使补习时间太长了，很容易变为超龄学生，这些学生，比方原来读英文的，是否就编到大学的英文系里，原来读东南亚各国文字的，是否就编入像北大的东语系里，同时适当的减少他们在大学中的一些课程，使他们同时能有多些时间去学习中文，这是值得考虑的一个问题。
    在日常生活方面，因为东南亚各地差不多都处在热带，与国内尤其是与国内的北方情况有了很大的差别。他们在东南亚时一天要洗澡两三次，就是一个例子。这虽然是生活小节，但对于刚从热带回国的侨生来说，还是一个问题。这些侨生，生长或长大于东南亚，很少或从来没有回到祖国；同时，又长期深受资产阶级的教育与文化的影响，他们回国之后，一方面感觉到祖国的温暖，感觉到党与人民政府对于他们的照顾，是无微不至；但另一方面，又觉到国内的生活方式与他们在东南亚所经历的，有了很多不同之处。怎样使他们能够很快的适应于这种新社会与新生活，也是一个很值得注意的问题。
    应该指出，上面所提出的一些问题，虽然值得注意，但并非难于解决。记得比方去年有的侨生，一听到要下乡劳动，思想就很为波动。他们说：“我们是回国读书，并非回来作‘苦力’。”但经过学校领导以及师长和同学把党的教育方针说明之后，他们不只愿意去作，而且作得很起劲。在工地上，侨生的积极分子并不算少。又如在学业方面，好多侨生也进步得很快。年来高等学校入学考试，侨生考上的百分比，也是很高。所以只要思想教育工作作得好，他们就转变得很快，进步得很快。
    总而言之，侨胞与侨生归到祖国，是全国人民所欢迎的，尤其是在祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业，正在飞跃的发展，需要更多的人力与技术人才，侨胞回国就业，侨生回国升学，愈多愈好。在上面，我们虽然提出侨生回国求学存在了一些问题，可是只要思想教育做得好，只要政治挂帅，业务学习与生活习惯上所存在的一些问题，也就容易解决。这样，我们相信，这些从海外回到祖国怀抱的年青一代，在不久的将来，在伟大的社会主义建设的阵线上，一定能做出出色的成绩。
