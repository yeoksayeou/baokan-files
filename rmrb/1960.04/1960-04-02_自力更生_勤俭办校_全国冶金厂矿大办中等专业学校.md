    Self-Reliance, Diligence and Thrift in Running Schools
    Metallurgical Factories and Mines Across the Country Vigorously Establish Secondary Vocational Schools

    (Our newspaper from Tianjin) The metallurgical system's factories, mines, and enterprises nationwide, relying on their own efforts and making full use of existing conditions, are vigorously establishing secondary vocational schools to cultivate technical talents for the metallurgical industry in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    The national metallurgical system currently has more than eighty secondary technical schools, with over 57,000 students, offering majors such as steelmaking, ironmaking, metallurgical machinery equipment, mining, and electrical equipment for industrial enterprises. Most of these schools were established by the metallurgical bureaus (departments) of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as factories and mining enterprises, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. From the very beginning, they have implemented the spirit of self-reliance and diligence in running schools, fully leveraging the potential of the enterprises. The Party committees and administrative leading departments of various factories and enterprises have equipped the schools with a strong core of leadership, such as the Tianjin Metallurgical Bureau, which successively transferred four veteran comrades who had undergone long-term revolutionary training to the Tianjin Metallurgical Industrial School to take on leadership roles, and appointed a deputy bureau director to serve concurrently as the principal. All schools have adopted the method of "preparing, learning, and building simultaneously." From preparation to the start of classes generally took only a few months, and in some cases, even less than two months. The lack of teachers was addressed through various measures, such as drawing teachers from older schools, assigning engineering and technical cadres to the new schools as full-time teachers, assigning college and vocational school graduates to teach at various schools, and entrusting other universities to provide training. When there were no school buildings, the masses were mobilized to build them themselves or to use old buildings of factories and mines as classrooms. Many schools also adopted various methods, such as self-manufacturing, purchasing, or collaborating with schools outside the area, to solve the difficulty of insufficient teaching equipment.

    More than a year of practice has proven that running schools by factories and mining enterprises is a good way to cultivate technical talents in a faster, better, and more economical way. It mobilizes the enthusiasm of these units in running schools in all aspects and makes full use of the existing human and material resources of factories and mining enterprises. For example, the Longyan Iron and Steel Industrial School in Hebei Province was allocated funds and more than 2,000 square meters of old factory buildings by the Longyan Iron and Steel Company. With the strong support of all miners, the teachers and students of the whole school worked hard for sixty days and built a new school building with more than 5,200 square meters. The Xikuangshan Mining Bureau in Hunan Province adopted the method of contracting on a counterpart basis, with each professional department responsible for the teaching work of the relevant professional departments of the Xikuangshan Industrial School. With only four full-time teachers, it relied on more than 50 technicians and staff from factories and mines to teach part-time, and ran a school with more than 400 people.

    Running schools by factories and mining enterprises also creates favorable conditions for implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor. Many schools use the production sites of factories and mines as bases for students' productive labor and internships. Students' labor or internships at the production site not only greatly enriches their perceptual knowledge and consolidates their theoretical knowledge, but also effectively improves the quality of teaching. For example, the steelmaking students of the Fushun Iron and Steel Industrial School went to the production site for labor and internship for two and a half months before learning professional knowledge. Under the guidance of experienced workers and teachers, they refined five furnaces of high-quality steel of different types.

    The advantages of running schools by factories and mining enterprises are also reflected in the school's political work and in the ideological transformation of teachers and students. Because the school is under the unified leadership of the Party committee of the factory and mining enterprise, the mass production movement and technological innovation movement of the factory and mining enterprise also promote the continuous revolution of the school work. In particular, these teachers and students who are not from the working class have more opportunities to eat, live, and work with the workers, and gradually cultivate and enhance the labor view, mass view, and collectivist spirit of teachers and students.

    Recently, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held an on-site experience exchange meeting of newly established secondary vocational schools in the metallurgical system in Tianjin. The meeting highlighted the experiences in running schools diligently and thriftily, relying on self-reliance, and fully utilizing and vigorously tapping the potential of factories and mining enterprises in running schools. It broke down past superstitions such as "building school buildings before enrolling students," "having equipment before starting classes," "only college graduates can teach vocational schools," "teacher training must be done slowly," and "poor conditions cannot improve the quality of education," thereby greatly liberating the mind and further inspiring the confidence of the representatives of more than 50 schools attending the meeting. All schools expressed their willingness to continue to implement the Party's education policy under the leadership of the Party, vigorously carry out mass movements, and fight against various difficulties with a spirit of continuous revolution, and strive to reach the advanced level of national vocational schools in terms of education quality in one, two, or three years.

    自力更生  勤俭办校
    全国冶金厂矿大办中等专业学校
    本报天津讯　全国冶金系统厂矿、企业，自力更生充分利用现有条件，大办中等专业学校，为冶金工业多快好省地培养技术人才。
    全国冶金系统现有八十多所中等技术学校，学生五万七千多人，设有炼钢、炼铁、冶金机械装备、采矿和工业企业电气装备等专业。这些学校大部分是1958年大跃进以来由各省、市、自治区冶金厅（局）和厂矿企业举办的。一举办就贯彻了自力更生、勤俭办校的精神，充分发挥了企业的潜力。各工厂企业的党委和行政领导部门为学校配备了一批坚强的领导骨干，如天津市冶金局先后调了四位经过长期革命锻炼的老同志到天津冶金工业学校担任领导工作，并指派一位副局长兼任校长。各学校都采取了“边筹建、边学习、边建设”的办法。从筹建到开学上课一般只有几个月，有的甚至还不到两个月。师资缺乏就采取抽掉老学校教师、工程技术干部到新校作专职教师，配备大专、中专毕业生到各校任教，指派各厂矿工程技术人员兼课，委托其他高等学校代为培训等多种措施加以解决。没有校舍就发动群众自己动手兴建或利用厂矿企业的旧房充当课室。不少学校还采取自制、购买或与校外协作等各种办法解决教学设备不足的困难。
    一年多来的实践证明：厂矿企业办学是多快好省地培养技术人才的一种好形式。它调动了这些单位各方面办学的积极性，充分利用了厂矿企业现有的人力和物力。如河北省龙烟钢铁工业学校由龙烟钢铁公司拨给了经费和二千多平方米旧厂房，在全矿工人的大力支援下，全校师生苦战了六十天，便新建和改建成了一座五千二百多平方米的校舍。湖南省锡矿山矿务局采取对口包干的办法，由各专业科室负责锡矿山工业学校有关专业科的教学工作，在只有四名专职教师的情况下，依靠了厂矿五十多名技术人员和职员兼职任教，办起了四百多人的学校。
    厂矿企业办学还为贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针创造了有利条件。许多学校利用厂矿的生产现场作为学生生产劳动基地和实习场所。学生在生产现场劳动或实习，不仅大大丰富了感性知识，巩固了所学的理论知识，而且还有效地提高了教学质量。如抚顺钢铁工业学校的炼钢专业学生，在没有学专业知识之前，就去生产现场劳动实习了两个半月，在老师傅和教师的指导下，炼出了五炉不同型号的优质钢。
    厂矿企业办学的优越性还体现在学校的政治工作上，体现在师生的思想改造上。由于学校在厂矿企业党委的统一领导下，厂矿企业的群众性生产运动和技术革新运动也促使学校工作不断革命。特别是这些非工人阶级出身的教师和学生有较多的机会和工人们同吃同住同劳动，逐步培养、增强了师生的劳动观点、群众观点和集体主义精神。
    最近，冶金部在天津召开了冶金系统新办中等专业学校的现场经验交流会。在会上突出地介绍了勤俭办学、自力更生以及充分利用、大力挖掘厂矿企业办学潜力等方面的经验，破除了过去“先盖校舍后招生”、“先有设备后上课”、“大专毕业才能教中专”、“师资培养得慢慢来”、“条件不好就提高不了教育质量”等迷信，从而大大解放了思想，更加鼓舞了五十多所到会学校代表的信心，各校纷纷表示要在党的领导下，继续贯彻党的教育方针，大搞群众运动，以不断革命的精神向各种困难做斗争，力争在一、二年或二、三年内在教育质量上达到全国中专学校先进水平。（敏生、晶昌）
