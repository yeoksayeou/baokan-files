Shortcut to Making Money
    Chi Beiou Poem, Hua Junwu Drawing

    The Cuban revolutionary government has again uncovered a case of counterfeiting Cuban National Bank notes, and four Americans have been arrested. The counterfeit money was manufactured in Florida, USA, and then brought to Cuba.

    Real American planes,
    Take off from America;
    Fake Cuban banknotes,
    Made in U.S.A. ①
    Killing people with bombing planes,
    Making money by manufacturing counterfeit currency.
    Yesterday, stealing Cuba's money,
    Through land grabbing, investment, and opening companies;
    Today, stealing Cuba's money,
    Relying only on a printing press.
    Although the methods are different,
    They are both "legitimate interests". ②
    Using fake banknotes as real money,
    Harming others to benefit oneself.
    Both causing trouble for Cuba,
    And making a big profit.
    Unfortunately, the calculation didn't work out,
    The lackeys were unsuccessful from the start,
    It seems they have to change their strategy again,
    Anyway, there are plenty of destructive things to do.

    ① Made in U.S.A.
    ② Maintaining America's "legitimate interests" has always been the excuse for American interference in Cuba (with picture)

    谋财捷径
    池北偶诗　华君武画
    古巴革命政府又破获了一起伪造古巴国家银行纸币的案件，有四个美国人已经被逮捕。伪币是在美国的佛罗里达制造的，然后被带到古巴。
    真的美国飞机，
    从美国起飞；
    假的古巴钞票，
    Made in U．S．A．①
    害命用飞机轰炸，
    谋财靠制造伪币。
    昨天弄古巴的钱，
    霸地、投资、开公司；
    今天弄古巴的钱，
    只凭一架印刷机。
    手段虽然有别，
    同是“合法利益”。②
    假钞票当真钱使，
    损人而利己。
    既给古巴捣乱，
    又可捞一大笔。
    可惜算盘不如意，
    喽罗出师就不利，
    看来又得再换一着棋，
    反正破坏的行当有的是。
    ①美国制
    ②维护美国的“合法利益”一直是美国干涉古巴的借口（附图片）
