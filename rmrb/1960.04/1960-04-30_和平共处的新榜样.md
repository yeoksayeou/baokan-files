    At the invitation of Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala, our Premier Zhou Enlai visited our friendly neighbor Nepal from April 26 to 29 and was given a grand reception and warm welcome by the government and people of the Kingdom of Nepal. During his visit, Premier Zhou Enlai held sincere talks with Prime Minister Koirala and achieved further results in developing the friendly relationship between China and Nepal: the signing of the Sino-Nepalese Treaty of Peace and Friendship, and the exchange of instruments of ratification for the Sino-Nepalese agreement on the boundary question. The significant achievements of Prime Minister Koirala's visit to China and Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Nepal, mark a new stage in the friendly relations between China and Nepal. At the same time, we are pleased to see that the Burmese Parliament approved on April 28 the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese agreement on the boundary question, which were signed not long ago. The new development of friendly relations between China and Nepal, and between China and Burma, have set new examples for following the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, and for developing solidarity, friendly relations and cooperative relations among Asian and African countries.
    The fruitful mutual friendly visits between the leaders of the Chinese, Nepalese and Burmese governments in recent times have convincingly proved that the friendly cooperative relations and solidarity of Asian and African countries have a deep foundation. This is because there is a long tradition of friendship between the peoples of China, Nepal, and Burma, and all confirm the Bandung Spirit and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the norms for handling international relations. Furthermore, opposition to imperialist aggression, safeguarding world peace, and building their own countries to quickly get rid of economic and cultural backwardness are the common aspirations of the peoples of Asian and African countries. In order to realize these common aspirations, Asian and African countries, despite the differences in social and political systems, have a thousand and one reasons to develop friendly and mutually beneficial cooperative relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and no reason whatsoever to harm such friendship and cooperation. The facts are very clear: as long as the leaders of Asian and African countries put the friendship and common interests between the peoples of Asian and African countries first, they can make outstanding contributions to the cause of solidarity among Asian and African countries. We are pleased to see that the mutual visits of the leaders of China and Burma have led to the signing and ratification of the Sino-Burmese agreement on the boundary question and the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression; the mutual visits of the leaders of China and Nepal have led to the signing of the Sino-Nepalese agreement on the boundary question, the Sino-Nepalese economic assistance agreement, and the Sino-Nepalese Treaty of Peace and Friendship. This is completely in line with the common aspirations and common interests of the Chinese, Burmese and Nepalese peoples, and it is also completely in line with the aspirations and interests of the peoples of Asian and African countries for peace and friendship. Only those imperialists and reactionaries with ulterior motives who hope to undermine the friendly relations between Asian and African countries will feel displeased and hostile about this.
    The boundary agreements between China and Nepal, and between China and Burma, show that these complex boundary issues left over from history are necessary and also completely capable of being resolved rationally. As a result of imperialist aggression in history, some boundary issues exist between China and its southwestern neighbors. The attitude taken towards the resolution of boundary issues is a test of whether the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are being observed. There can be two attitudes: one is to adopt an attitude that is not friendly consultation, to insist on unilaterally imposing unfair and unreasonable demands on the other party, and even to unreasonably exert pressure on the other party with slander and defamation. This is obviously a violation of the Five Principles and, of course, cannot lead to a reasonable resolution of the boundary issue. The other is to adopt an attitude of friendly consultation, and to achieve a mutually agreed, reasonable and fair solution to the boundary issue in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation. This is in line with the Five Principles. The Chinese government has consistently adopted the latter attitude. We are pleased to see that the Burmese government and the Nepalese government have also adopted the same attitude. Neither China and Nepal nor China and Burma has deliberately exaggerated the boundary issue, let alone used this issue to damage each other's harmony. The boundary between China and Nepal has never been demarcated, so it is natural that some differences exist between the two sides on the boundary issue. Acknowledging these differences not only does not harm the friendly relations between the two sides, but only in this way can friendly consultations be conducted in a realistic manner to reasonably resolve the boundary issue. China and Nepal, precisely on the premise of acknowledging the existence of disputes between the two sides on the boundary issue, conducted sincere and friendly consultations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and signed an agreement on the boundary issue. According to the Sino-Nepalese agreement on the boundary question, both sides unanimously agreed that the entire boundary between the two countries should be scientifically delineated and formally marked on the basis of the existing traditional customary line; for certain disputed sections, both sides agreed to make adjustments according to the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and friendly mutual accommodation. In order to ensure peace and friendship on the border, both sides agreed that within a 20-kilometer zone on their respective sides of the boundary, they would no longer send armed personnel for patrols. This has paved the way for a fair and reasonable overall resolution of the boundary issue between China and Nepal. Similarly, according to the Sino-Burmese agreement on the boundary question, both sides respected the facts, acknowledged that the northern section of the Sino-Burmese boundary was an undemarcated boundary, and believed that the boundary should be demarcated in accordance with the traditional customary line. For other issues related to the Sino-Burmese boundary, both sides took into consideration the historical background and the current situation, and sought an overall solution based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and friendly mutual accommodation. The signing of the Sino-Nepalese and Sino-Burmese agreements on the boundary question clearly shows that as long as both sides maintain a friendly attitude and a desire to resolve the problem, no matter how complex these problems are, they can be easily solved. As Premier Zhou Enlai said in Nepal, "As long as we adhere to the Five Principles, as long as we adhere to the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation that is fair to ourselves and fair to others, any problem between us can be solved fairly and reasonably." This is the case with the Sino-Nepalese boundary issue, and it is also the case with the Sino-Burmese boundary issue. The boundary issues between China and other countries should also be the same. During Premier Zhou Enlai's recent visit to India, no agreement could be reached on a reasonable solution to the Sino-Indian boundary issue. The responsibility for this lies entirely with the Indian side, as can be fully explained from Premier Zhou Enlai's speech and his answers to reporters' questions on the eve of his departure from India.
    The signing of the Sino-Nepalese Treaty of Peace and Friendship, like the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression not long ago, is a new achievement of the Chinese government's consistent pursuit of a peaceful foreign policy, and it is also a new achievement of the peaceful and neutral policies of the Government of His Majesty the King of Nepal and the Government of Burma. These two treaties of peace not only provide new guarantees for the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Nepal and between China and Burma, but also make significant contributions to the cause of solidarity and cooperation among Asian and African countries. Imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, has been or is piecing together aggressive military blocs in Asia and Africa, and is doing its best to create divisions and hostility among Asian and African countries. Under the patronage of U.S. imperialism, the forces of Japanese militarism are stepping up their resurgence and are again threatening the peace and security of Asian countries. Therefore, at this time, peace-loving countries in Asia and Africa should not only resolutely reject and oppose the imperialist policy of piecing together aggressive blocs, but should also resolutely safeguard and strive to promote the unity and friendly relations of the Asian and African countries. The Sino-Nepalese Treaty of Peace and Friendship and the Sino-Burma Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression, consolidate the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in the form of a treaty and concretize them, which once again proves the full vitality of the Five Principles and the Bandung Spirit. Those who clamor that the Five Principles are "outdated" are either deliberately provoking discord, or they themselves do not want the Five Principles at all.
    The further development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Nepal and between China and Burma has made peace-loving people all over the world, especially the peoples of Asian and African countries, rejoice, but it is resented by imperialism and reactionaries in various countries. Recently, imperialism and the reactionaries of some countries have been making every effort to spread rumors and slander China for "aggression," "expansion," and so on, in order to provoke friendly relations between China and Nepal and other neighboring countries. However, all these rumors and slanders cannot deceive people. Just public opinion in many Asian countries has given a resounding answer to the imperialist provocateurs. Nepal's "New Society" pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal on the two countries signing a treaty of peace and friendship "stems from a noble desire to maintain lasting peace and strong friendship." Indonesia's "Bandung News" pointed out that the recent agreement reached between China and Nepal "proves that China faithfully implements the Bandung Resolutions." An editorial in Burma's "Peacock Voice" also pointed out that "the Chinese government is sincere to small countries. It has no desire for aggression, but only a desire for peaceful coexistence."
    The Chinese people have been, are, and will continue to unremittingly work for the cause of solidarity among the Asian and African peoples, and for the development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and the Asian and African countries. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma, India, and Nepal once again demonstrates the sincere desire and firm belief of our government and people to seek and strengthen friendly cooperation with neighboring countries. The friendly cooperation between the Chinese people and the peoples of Asian and African countries cannot be destroyed by any force in the world. The cause of friendship and unity between the Asian and African peoples will surely continue to achieve new victories!

### 和平共处的新榜样

    和平共处的新榜样
    我国周恩来总理应尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊的邀请，从4月26日到29日访问了我们友好的邻邦尼泊尔，受到尼泊尔王国政府和人民的隆重的接待和热情的欢迎。周恩来总理在访问期间，同尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊进行了恳切的会谈，对于发展中尼两国友好关系取得进一步的成果：签订了中尼和平友好条约，并且交换了中尼两国政府关于两国边界问题的协定的批准书。不久前柯伊拉腊首相访问中国和这次周恩来总理访问尼泊尔所获得的重大成就，标志着中尼两国友好关系进入了一个新的阶段。与此同时，我们还高兴地看到，缅甸国会已于4月28日批准了不久前签订的中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和中缅关于两国边界问题的协定。中国和尼泊尔两国友好关系的新发展，同中国和缅甸之间友好关系的新发展，都为遵循和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，发展亚非国家之间的团结和友好合作关系，树立了新的榜样。
    最近期间，中尼两国和中缅两国政府领导人进行的富有成果的相互间的友好访问，令人信服地证明，亚非国家的友好合作和团结的关系有着深厚的基础。这是因为无论中尼和中缅人民之间都存在着悠久的传统友谊，并且都确认万隆精神及和平共处五项原则为处理国际关系的准则。而反对帝国主义的侵略，维护世界和平，建设自己的祖国，以迅速摆脱经济和文化上的落后状态，更是亚非各国人民的共同的愿望。为了实现这些共同的愿望，亚非国家之间，尽管存在着社会政治制度的不同，但有千条万条理由在平等互利的基础上发展友好和互助合作关系，而没有任何一条理由去损害这种友好和合作。事实非常明白，只要亚非国家的领导人都以亚非国家人民之间的友谊和共同利益为重，那么，他们就能够为亚非国家的团结事业作出卓越的贡献。我们高兴地看到，中缅两国领导人的相互访问，导致了中缅关于两国边界问题的协定和中缅友好和互不侵犯条约的签订和批准；中尼两国领导人的相互访问导致了中尼关于两国边界问题的协定、中尼两国经济援助协定和中尼和平友好条约的签订。这是完全符合中缅人民和中尼人民的共同愿望和共同利益的，也是完全符合亚非各国人民的和平和友好的愿望和利益的。只有那些指望破坏亚非国家之间的友好关系的帝国主义者和别有用心的反动派，才对此感到不快和仇视。
    中国和尼泊尔、中国和缅甸之间的边界问题协定表明，这种历史上遗留下来的复杂的边界问题，是必需而且也完全能够求得合理解决的。中国同它的西南邻邦之间，由于历史上帝国主义侵略的结果，存在一些边界问题。对于边界问题的解决采取什么态度，是是否遵守和平共处五项原则的考验。可以有两种态度：一种是采取不是友好协商的态度，硬要把片面的不公平的、不合理的主张强加于对方，甚至蛮不讲理地用诽谤和诬蔑向对方施加压力，这显然是违反五项原则的，当然不可能使边界问题得到合理解决。另一种是采取友好协商的态度，根据互谅互让的精神，使边界问题得到双方同意的合情合理的解决，这才是符合五项原则的。中国政府是一贯采取后一种态度的。我们高兴地看到缅甸政府和尼泊尔政府也采取同样的态度。无论中尼之间或中缅之间，都没有故意夸大边界问题，更没有利用这个问题来损害彼此的和睦。中尼之间的边界从未勘定过，因此双方对边界问题存在着某些分歧，这是很自然的事。承认这些分歧，不但并不损害双方的友好关系，而且只有这样才能够实事求是地为合理解决边界问题进行友好的协商。中尼两国正是在承认双方对边界问题存在争议的前提之下，在和平共处五项原则基础上，进行了诚挚而友好的协商，签订了关于边界问题的协定。根据中尼关于两国边界问题的协定，双方一致同意两国的全部边界应该在现有的传统习惯线的基础上加以科学地画出和正式地标定；对于某些有争议的地段，双方都同意根据平等互利和友好互让的原则进行调整。而为了确保边境的安宁和友好，双方又都同意每方在边界本侧二十公里的地区内，不再派出武装人员进行巡逻。这就为公平合理地全面地解决中尼两国的边界问题铺平了道路。同样，根据中缅关于边界问题的协定，双方都尊重事实，承认中缅边界的北段是未定界，并且认为应该遵照传统的习惯线定界。对于中缅边界的其他问题，双方也都是既考虑历史背景，又考虑现实状况，根据平等互利、友好互让的原则，求得了全面解决。中尼和中缅关于边界问题协定的签订，清楚地说明，只要双方都抱有友好的态度和希望解决问题的愿望，那么，不管这些问题是多么复杂，都会迎刃而解。正如周恩来总理在尼泊尔所讲的，“只要坚持五项原则，只要坚持对己公平、对人也公平的互谅互让的精神，我们之间的任何问题是可以求得公平合理的解决的。”中尼的边界问题如此，中缅的边界问题也如此，中国同其他国家的边界问题也应当如此。在周恩来总理这次访问印度期间，关于中印边界问题没有能够达成合理解决的协议，其责任完全不在中国方面，这从周恩来总理在离开印度前夕所发表的讲话和对记者的问题的回答中可以得到充分的说明。
    中尼和平友好条约的签订，同不久以前中缅友好和互不侵犯条约的签订一样，是中国政府一贯奉行的和平外交政策新建树，也是尼泊尔国王陛下政府和缅甸政府的和平中立政策的新建树。这两个和平条约，不仅为中尼和中缅的友好合作关系提供了新的保证，并且是对亚非各国团结和合作的事业作出了重大的贡献。帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义在亚洲和非洲已经或者正在拼凑侵略性的军事集团，竭力在亚非国家之间制造分裂，制造敌对。在美帝国主义的扶植下，日本的军国主义势力正在加紧抬头，重新威胁亚洲各国的和平和安全。因此，在这个时候，亚非爱好和平各国，不仅应该坚决拒绝和反对帝国主义拼凑侵略集团的政策，并且应该坚决维护和努力促进亚非国家的团结和友好关系。中尼和平友好条约和中缅友好和互不侵犯条约，把和平共处的五项原则用条约的形式固定下来，并加以具体化，这再一次证明了五项原则和万隆精神的充沛的生命力。那些叫嚷五项原则“已经过时”的人们，只是一种蓄意挑拨，或者是他们自己根本不要五项原则。
    中尼之间和中缅之间友好合作关系的进一步发展，使全世界爱好和平的人民，特别是亚非各国人民欢欣鼓舞，但是为帝国主义及各国反动分子所忌恨。最近帝国主义和有些国家的反动派声嘶力竭地造谣和诬蔑中国“侵略”、“扩张”等等，以挑拨中国和尼泊尔以及其它邻国之间的友好关系。但是，这一切造谣诽谤是骗不了人的。亚洲许多国家的公正舆论给了帝国主义挑拨者以响亮的回答。尼泊尔的“新社会报”指出，周恩来总理提出的关于两国缔结和平友好条约的建议，“是出于维护持久和平和坚强友谊的高尚愿望”。印度尼西亚的“万隆新闻”指出，中尼两国之间最近所达成的协议，“证明了中国忠实地执行了万隆的决议”。缅甸“孔雀之声报”的社论也指出，“中国政府对小国是真诚的，它没有侵略的欲望，而只有和平共处的愿望”。
    中国人民过去、现在和将来都坚持不懈地为亚非人民的团结事业，为发展中国和亚非各国的友好合作关系而努力。我国周恩来总理这次对缅甸、印度和尼泊尔的访问，又一次表明了我国政府和人民努力寻求和加强同邻国友好合作的真诚愿望和坚定信念。中国人民和亚非各国人民的友好合作是世界上任何力量都破坏不了的。亚非人民的友好和团结事业必将不断取得新胜利！
