Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 24th: According to TASS, the “Neues Deutschland” published a statement by the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party protesting the recent anti-democratic trials conducted by the Greek authorities.

The statement said that on April 5th, the Athens military court began the trial of fourteen Greek patriots falsely accused of espionage. Following this trial, there will be two more trials: one on April 26th for fifty patriots, and another on May 5th for two patriots. The defendants are activists of the Greek Communist Party and other patriots, including Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party, Eritrealis, and members of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party, Patsalidis, Loulis, Florakis, Dalassi, and Kukoulu. Most of the defendants have already been imprisoned for five or six years.

The Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party then pointed out that the Karamanlis government, which is cooperating closely with the Strauss and Pentagon "Cold War" groups, is attempting to create obstacles on the road to easing international tensions through this judicial terror, and is attempting to create the impression that détente in the Balkans is impossible due to the "crimes" of the Communist Party. The statement said, however, that the Greek people know the truth. The activities of the defendants—the leaders of the Greek Communist Party—and the entire history of the Greek Communist Party are very well understood by the people.

The statement emphasized that the danger should not be ignored. In order to realize its anti-democratic plans, the government is attempting to achieve the goals that it did not achieve in the trials of Glezos and other patriots: to sentence the patriots to death and execute them. The people have enough strength to save their warriors as they saved Glezos, and they will abolish the fascist laws No. 375 and No. 509 through their struggle, strive for the release of prisoners and exiles, and strive for the legalization of the Greek Communist Party and amnesty. The Central Committee finally called on all Greek democrats to understand and cooperate with each other.

    希共发表声明抗议当局的政治迫害
    希腊人民将尽力援救爱国者
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社柏林24日讯：“新德意志报”登载了希腊共产党中央委员会的一篇声明，抗议希腊当局近来进行的反民主的审讯。
    声明说，4月5日，雅典军事法庭开始审讯十四名被诬告进行间谍活动的希腊爱国者。在这次审讯之后，又将有另外两次审讯：一次是4月26日对五十名爱国者的审讯，另一次是在5月5日对两名爱国者的审讯。被告们是希腊共产党的活动家和其他爱国者，包括有希腊共产党中央委员会政治局候补委员埃里特里阿利斯、希腊共产党中央委员会委员帕察利迪斯、卢利斯、弗洛拉基斯、达拉西、库考卢等同志。大部分被告都已被监禁五、六年。
    希腊共产党中央委员会接着指出，同施特劳斯和五角大楼“冷战”集团进行密切合作的卡拉曼利斯政府，企图用这种司法恐怖在通向缓和国际紧张局势的道路上制造障碍，企图造成这样一种印象：似乎由于共产党的罪过，巴尔干的缓和才成为不可能。声明说，但是希腊人民知道真理。被告——希腊共产党领导人的活动和希腊共产党的全部历史，都是人民非常了解的。
    声明强调说，但是不应当忽视危险。为了能够实现自己的反民主计划，政府企图达到在对格列索斯和其他爱国者的审讯中没有达到的目的：判处爱国者死刑和处死他们。人民拥有足够的力量像拯救格列索斯那样来拯救自己的战士，而且他们将通过自己的斗争来废除第三百七十五号和第五百零九号法西斯法律，争取释放被监禁者和被流放者，争取希腊共产党合法化和大赦。中央委员会最后呼吁希腊全体民主分子彼此了解和合作。
