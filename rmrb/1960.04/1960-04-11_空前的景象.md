    Unprecedented Scene	Yao Xin, Second Secretary of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    I cannot write down everything that has happened in our region. I just want to talk about the unprecedented scene that has emerged in our Yanbian region after the implementation of the Central Committee's call for the whole party and the whole people to vigorously develop pig farming.

    This was last autumn. With two consecutive years of great leaps forward in industry and agriculture, although pig farming had also developed, it was still not commensurate with the great leaps forward in industry and agriculture. Therefore, the Prefecture Committee took measures to vigorously develop pig production. At the beginning of this year, the Prefecture Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Committee, made a decision to mobilize the whole party and the whole people to vigorously develop pig farming, and convened a prefecture-wide pig farming conference to implement it. After this, the number of pigs increased sharply. By March 14th, the number of pigs in the prefecture had increased by 6.96% compared with before the prefecture-wide pig farming conference. The development speed of Dunhua County was even faster, reaching two pigs per household. This speed was unprecedented.

    There are many barren hills in the rural suburbs of Yanji City, with grass and water, suitable for the development of animal husbandry. Here, pigsties were built one after another, barren land was reclaimed piece by piece, the flowing water of river ditches was blocked, and groups of sows were driven in. This place has become a large-scale pig farming base.

    I once visited the Dexin Pig Farm of the Chaoyang People's Commune in Yanji County, which was established by the Chaoyang People's Commune with its own strength. The current scale is not large, with only one hundred and two sows, but the development plan is very amazing. They plan to develop to five thousand heads within the year. I was a little surprised when I heard this, and asked them what measures they would take to ensure it? The breeders replied, "Carry out the 'one pig, one hundred grandchildren' campaign." In order to realize this plan, the breeders are making various efforts in the face of wind and snow. Hot mating, double mating, re-mating, artificial estrus induction, and artificial insemination have been successfully tested in this pig farm. Helong County recently launched a crash breeding and spring epidemic prevention campaign. More than 1,700 cadres at the county, commune, and management area levels participated in this campaign, and the number of participating commune members was even uncountable. Once the masses are mobilized, there are so many methods. Not to mention anything else, just in terms of artificial estrus induction, in addition to injections, there are more than ten kinds of indigenous methods such as feeding garlic and eggs. In just over ten days, all 3,757 sows in the county were bred and prevented from swine fever.

    That day, we went to see the county's breeding pig farm. This is a large-scale breeding pig farm with 748 sows and boars, all of which are excellent breeds. On the one hand, they are responsible for supplying the county with excellent breeds, and on the other hand, they are responsible for providing advanced feeding experience to the people's communes. The feeding method in this farm is quite scientific. Sows, reserve sows, boars, and reserve boars are all raised in separate pens. From feed processing to feed cooking, as well as water delivery and material transportation, all are mechanized and semi-mechanized. Various feeds are processed into fine materials by pulverizers or vegetable cutters, and then sent to the cooking buckets by conveyor belts. As soon as the hot air stove is opened, the hot air sprays into the cooking buckets, and the feed is cooked until it is mushy in ten or twenty minutes. Then, the breeders use feed carts to send the cooked feed to each pen. These tools are very easy to operate and very labor-saving. Originally, fifteen people were raising all the pigs in the farm, but now six people have been reduced, and it is still very spacious. Before mechanization, it took more than two hours to feed the pigs once, but now it only takes twenty minutes to feed all the more than 700 pigs in the farm. Except for the feed pulverizer, which was bought with money, the hot air stove, cooking bucket, feeding cart, wooden track, and flowing water trough were all made by the breeders under the leadership of the Party branch, using broken wood and iron sheets. Looking at the achievements made by this farm, I was thinking about how to promote these good experiences throughout the prefecture. A young man standing next to me smiled and asked us what we thought. We said, "Very good!" The young man smiled again and said, "But we are not satisfied yet. We want to further improve and achieve a higher degree of mechanization. All work will be operated by machinery, reaching the level of each breeder raising 700 pigs..." The young man said very confidently. I have no doubt about his idea.

    This outstanding young man is Bao Pixing, a famous model breeder in the prefecture. He is twenty-four years old this year and has been here for ten years. He works for the Party honestly and diligently and is determined to become a pig farming expert. He wants to dedicate his youth, no, he wants to dedicate his whole life to the people's pig farming cause. Who doesn't love and admire such a good breeder!

    With the Party's correct policies, with such a vigorous mass movement, with the rich experience that has been accumulated, and with thousands of backbones like Bao Pixing on the pig farming front, it is possible that in the near future, our pig farming industry will increase tenfold, twentyfold, or even a hundredfold on the existing basis.

    空前的景象	中共吉林延边朝鲜族自治州委员会第二书记　姚昕
    我不能够把在我们地区所发生的一切，都写出来。我只想说说，在我们延边地区贯彻执行中央关于全党全民大办养猪事业的号召以后，所出现的空前景象。
    这还是去年秋天的事情，工业农业连续两年大跃进，养猪事业虽然也有了发展，但与工农业大跃进相比，仍然不相适应。因此，州委采取措施大力发展养猪生产。今年年初，州委又根据党中央和省委的指示，作出全党全民动员起来大力发展养猪事业的决定，并召开全州规模的养猪会议，加以贯彻。在这之后，猪的头数急剧地增长，到3月14日，全州猪的头数就比全州养猪会议前增加了6.96％。敦化县的发展速度更是迅速，已经达到了每户两头猪。这种速度是以前所没有过的。
    延吉市郊农村荒山很多，有草有水，适于发展畜牧业。在这里一个个猪舍盖起来了，一片片荒地开出来了，一条条河沟的流水拦起来了，一群群母猪赶进来了。这里变成了规模巨大的养猪基地。
    我曾经访问过延吉县朝阳人民公社德新养猪场，这是朝阳人民公社用自己的力量办起来的。现在的规模倒是不大，只有一百零二头母猪，可是发展计划却非常惊人。他们计划在年内要发展到五千头。我听了有点吃惊，问他们用什么措施来保证？饲养员们回答说：“开展一猪百孙运动。”为了实现这个计划，饲养员们正冒着风雪做着各种努力。热配、双配、复配、人工催情、人工授精等办法，在这个猪场里已经试验成功。和龙县最近开展了突击配种和春季防疫运动，光参加这个运动的县、社、管理区三级干部就有一千七百多名，参加的社员群众更是无法计算。群众一发动起来，办法真是多极了，别的不用说，单是人工催情这一种，除了打注射液之外，还有喂大蒜、喂鸡蛋等上十种土办法。仅仅十几天，全县三千七百五十七头母猪全部配上了种，并防止了猪瘟的发生。
    那天，我们顺便去看了这个县的种猪场，这是一个规模较大的种猪场，饲养七百四十八头母猪和种公猪，都是优良品种。一方面，他们担负着供应全县优良品种的任务，另一方面，又担负着为各人民公社提供先进饲养经验的责任。这个场的喂养方法相当科学，母猪、后备母猪、公猪、后备公猪都分圈饲养，从饲料加工到饲料蒸煮，以及送水运料，全部实现了机械化和半机械化。各种饲料，用粉碎机或者用切菜机加工成细料之后，就用传送带把它们送入蒸煮桶里，热气炉一开放，热气就喷入蒸煮桶里，一、二十分钟以后，饲料就煮得稀烂。然后，饲养员们把煮烂的饲料，用饲料车送到各圈舍。这些工具操纵起来，非常轻便，又非常省劲。原来是十五个人饲养全场的猪，现在减掉了六个人，还很宽绰。实现机械化以前，喂一次猪需要两个多小时，现在，仅用二十分钟就把全场七百多头猪喂完了。除了那饲料粉碎机是花钱买来之外，热气炉、蒸煮桶、送料车、木轨道、流水槽，都是饲养员们在党支部领导下，用破烂木料和铁片做成的。我看着这个场子达到的这些成就，心里就想着怎样把这些好的经验在全州推广。站在我身边的一个小伙子，笑眯着眼睛问我们怎么样？我们说：“很好！”小伙子又笑着说：“可是我们还不满足，我们还要进一步改进，达到更高度的机械化，全部工作都用机械操纵，达到每个饲养员饲养七百口猪的水平……”小伙子说得非常自信。我毫不怀疑他的想法。
    这个出色的小伙子就是全州著名的模范饲养员——包丕信。他今年二十四岁，在这里整整十年了。他老老实实、勤勤恳恳为党工作，并立志要做养猪专家。他要把自己的青春，不，他要把自己的一生献给人民的养猪事业。这样好的饲养员谁不爱，谁不钦佩！
    有了党的正确的方针政策，有了这样轰轰烈烈的群众运动，有了已经积累起来的丰富经验，有了像包丕信这样千万个养猪战线上的骨干，在不久的将来，我们的养猪事业，在现有的基础上，翻上十番、二十番、甚至上百番都是可能的。
