Facts and Figures

    ☆ Shandong's various regions vigorously innovated water lifting tools in the fight against drought. Since the beginning of spring, more than 853,000 new water lifting tools have been added throughout the province, including 410,000 new wooden and iron waterwheels, which is 30% more than the total number of waterwheels added last year.

    ☆ On the industrial front, from large state-owned industries to small-scale industries in communes and teams, the province has produced 98,277 horsepower of power irrigation machinery, exceeding the annual production task.

    ☆ The province has organized more than 190,000 skilled workers to go deep into the countryside to participate in drought resistance. These skilled workers helped communes repair more than 6,400 power machines and more than 37,000 iron waterwheels, so that more than 90% of the unusable machines and more than 97% of the unusable waterwheels were put back into use for drought resistance.

    ☆ More than 70,000 employees on the financial and trade front in the province have delivered a large number of drainage and irrigation machinery and drought-resistant materials to the production front in a timely manner. In the Changwei area, 20,000 people were linked with more than 5,300 production teams, establishing a delivery system. During the drought resistance period, they have delivered goods more than 124,000 times.

    ☆ Scientific and technological organizations in 26 counties, together with the broad masses of farmers, have modified and created a variety of water lifting tools. The Yantai Prefectural Agricultural Science Institute successfully trial-produced a pedal-operated flywheel waterwheel, which reduces labor intensity by three-fifths compared to the Liberation-style waterwheel. The Shandong Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Mechanics has also achieved certain results in artificial rainfall experiments in more than a dozen counties (cities) including Dezhou, Liaocheng, and Weifang. The Institute of Mechanical Power sent technical cadres to Zhangqiu, Ye County and other places to help communes manufacture internal combustion pumps that consume less coal, can lift water more than four meters high, and can pump 50 tons of water per hour, which are very popular among farmers.

    ☆ The province's health departments have also organized more than 87,000 medical personnel to the front lines of drought resistance, serving the drought resistance army while also participating in the drought resistance struggle. Since the beginning of this spring's drought resistance, the Shandong Provincial Pharmaceutical Administration Bureau has supplied 2.3 billion pills of Rentan, 350,000 boxes of Cooling Oil, 35 tons of Xinhua Dan, and one ton of emergency water to various parts of the province.

    ☆ Large-scale artistic performance groups, such as those performing Liuqin Opera, Bangzi Opera, Lü Opera, Beijing Opera, drama, song and dance, and acrobatics, have all gone to the countryside, performing for the masses while fighting the drought. Film projection teams have also gone deep into the front lines of drought resistance, using their rest time to screen various newsreels, science education films, and feature films related to drought resistance for the drought resistance army. Libraries and cultural centers in various places have also brought books and newspapers to the front lines of drought resistance, and some have even held rich photo exhibitions in the fields, greatly inspiring the morale of the masses.

    山东各行业支援抗旱
    ☆山东各地在抗旱中大闹提水工具改革。入春以来，全省新增提水工具八十五万三千多件，其中新铁木质水车四十一万部，比去年全年增加水车还多30％。
    ☆在工业战线上，全省从国营大工业到社、队的小工业，到目前为止，已赶制出动力排灌机械九万八千二百七十七马力，超过了全年的生产任务。
    ☆全省组织了十九万多名技术工人深入农村参加抗旱。这些技术工人帮助公社修复动力机械六千四百多台，修复铁质水车三万七千多部，使90％以上不能用的机械和97％以上不能用的水车重新用于抗旱。
    ☆全省有七万多财贸战线上的职工，把大量的排灌机械和抗旱物资及时送到了生产战线上去。昌潍专区有两万人与五千三百多个生产队联系挂钩，建立了送货制度，在抗旱期间已送货十二万四千多人次。
    ☆有二十六个县的科学技术组织和广大农民群众一起，改制和创造了多种提水工具。烟台专区农业科学研究所试制成功脚踏飞轮水车，劳动强度比解放式水车减轻了五分之三。中国科学院山东分院力学研究所在德州、聊城、潍坊等十几个县（市）试验人工降雨也收到一定效果。机械动力研究所派技术干部到章丘、掖县等地帮助公社制造出用煤少、扬水四米多高、一小时能吸水五十吨的内燃水泵，很受农民欢迎。
    ☆全省卫生部门也组织了八万七千多名医务人员到抗旱前线，一面为抗旱大军服务，一面参加抗旱斗争。山东省药政管理局从今春抗旱以来，共供应全省各地仁丹二十三亿粒，清凉油三十五万盒，新华丹三十五吨，急救水一吨。
    ☆柳子、梆子、吕剧、京剧、话剧、歌舞、杂技等大型艺术演出团体都分赴农村，边抗旱，边为群众演出。电影放映队也都深入抗旱前线，利用休息时间为抗旱大军放映各种与抗旱有关的新闻纪录片、科学教育片和故事片。各地图书馆、文化馆也把书报拿到抗旱前线，有的还在田间办了内容丰富的图片展览，大大激励了群众斗志。
