    Changes of "Using Wells as Markets"
    Shi Yunxin
    In Chinese idioms, "market street" and "market" are synonymous. "Shi" means "exchange," while "jing" (well) and "chang" (field) refer to locations. Together, they both mean "a place for conducting exchanges."
    The origin of the term "market street" is found in the "Annotations to the Treatise on the Balanced Standard" in the Records of the Grand Historian: "In ancient times, there were neither markets nor wells. People would gather at the well to draw water in the morning and sell goods by the well, hence the term 'market street'." This aligns with the historical materialism viewpoint. From the perspective of human social development, it was indeed the case: in the late primitive society, with the development of productive forces, there was a surplus of production. To meet their living needs, people needed to exchange goods. The well, where people drank and used water every day, became a good place for exchange. Thus, places with wells gradually developed into market towns and cities.
    "Using wells as markets" was an inevitable result of social development. The rise of towns and the development of the economy are greatly related to humanity. However, the emergence of the exploiting classes followed, bringing humanity into a class society where most people labored without gain, while a few gained without labor, which was extremely unfair and unreasonable.
    "Using wells as markets" was the sprout of class society.
    But history is ultimately developing. "Using wells as markets" and class society will certainly not last forever, but will be replaced by more beautiful new things.
    Now we have reached the era of "gathering at the canteen." The five characters "gathering at the canteen" are not found in classical texts, but are coined for the sake of summarization and symmetry. "Canteen" refers to the public canteens of the People's Communes, and "gathering at the canteen" means that the commune members regard the canteen as a place for eating, chatting, holding meetings, studying, and entertaining every day – a place for gatherings. This is the emergence of beautiful and brand-new things.
    The agricultural cooperativization and people's commune movements have changed the individual production of farmers for thousands of years into collective production; the public canteen has further changed the old habits of individual life of farmers for thousands of years, and gradually collectivized them. This is a great event. The establishment of public canteens not only liberates women's labor force, but more importantly, the commune members can use it as a place for eating, chatting, holding meetings, studying, and entertaining, and gradually make the canteen a center for the political, economic, and cultural activities of the production team, breaking the boundaries of small families and forming a large family, which improves the degree of collectivization of commune members' lives. From the past winter to spring and from last winter to this spring, I participated in the rectification of communes in the suburbs of Nanjing and the mountainous areas of Jiangning County, and I have a deep understanding of this. Farmhouses are generally very small and cannot be used for gatherings; canteens are generally larger (some are converted from temples or ancestral halls) and can be used for gatherings. In better conditions, tables and benches are available, and those close to the city have even installed electric lights (like Xiaolingwei in Nanjing). In this way, the canteen naturally becomes a good place for commune members to eat, hold meetings, study, record work points, rehearse programs, post big-character posters, etc. Even the elderly who rarely go out and work in the fields can meet and chat with everyone when they go to the canteen three times a day to eat or get food, and children who like to join in the fun run to the canteen for everything. The canteen is so important to people's lives and the relationship is so close, that it naturally becomes an invisible link, linking farmers who are accustomed to individual life into a whole in life after collectivization in production. What a great effect this is!
    New things have unlimited vitality. In some well-run canteens, because the problem of eating vegetables has been solved, some commune members feel that it is no longer necessary to grow vegetables individually and automatically hand in their private plots. In some places, where people live more scattered, it is inconvenient to travel back and forth to the canteen, so they move to live around the canteen, spontaneously forming a concentrated trend, which creates the prerequisite for establishing new "residential points" in the future.
    In the course of historical development, since "using wells as markets" can lead to the emergence of private ownership society and individual life, then, in the course of historical development, "gathering at the canteen" will inevitably lead to the development of public ownership society and collective life to a higher and more beautiful stage.

    “以井为市”的变化
    侍云馨
    中国的成语里，“市井”和“市场”是同义语。市作“交换”讲，“井”和“场”作地方讲，合起来就都是“进行交换的地方”。
    “市井”一词的来源在“史记平准书正义”：“古人未有市及井，若朝聚井汲水，便将货物于井边货卖，故言市井也。”这很合乎历史唯物论的观点。按人类社会的发展来看，正是这样：在原始社会末期，随生产力的发展，生产有了剩余，人们为了满足生活需要，便需进行交换。交换得有地方，人们每天喝水、用水的井边就成了交换的好场所。于是，有井的地方，就逐渐发展成为集镇和城市。
    “以井为市”是社会发展的必然结果。市镇的兴起，经济的发展，与人类有莫大的关系。但随之而来的却是剥削阶级的产生，把人类带入了大部分人辛劳无得，少部分人不劳而获的极不公平合理的阶级社会。
    “以井为市”是阶级社会的萌芽。
    但历史终究是发展的。“以井为市”和阶级社会当然不会万古长存，而必将为更美好的新事物来取而代之。
    如今到了“以食堂而聚”的时代。“以食堂而聚”五字不见经籍，是为了概括、对称方便起见而杜撰的。“食堂”指人民公社的公共食堂，“以食堂而聚”就是人民公社的社员群众把食堂作为每天吃饭、谈心、开会、学习、娱乐的场所——聚会的地方。这是美好的崭新的事物的出现。
    农业合作化和人民公社化运动把农民几千年来的个体生产改变为集体生产；公共食堂又进而改变了农民几千年来个体生活的旧习惯，而使之逐步集体化。这就是了不起的大事。公共食堂的举办，不仅解放了妇女劳动力，而且更主要的是社员可以此作为吃饭、谈心、开会、学习、娱乐的场所，而逐渐使食堂形成为生产小队政治、经济、文化活动的中心，打破了小家庭的界限，形成了一个大家庭，提高了社员生活集体化的程度。在前冬去春和去冬今春之际，笔者曾分别到南京市郊区和江宁县山区参加整社工作，对此体会很深。农舍一般很小，不能集会；食堂一般较大（有的是庙宇或祠堂改的），可以集会。条件好的，桌子板凳俱全，靠城市近的还单独拉了电灯（像南京孝陵卫）。这样一来，食堂就自然而然地成为社员群众吃饭、开会、学习、记工分、排节目、贴大字报等等的好地方，就是平素不大出门下地的老人一天三餐到食堂吃饭或打饭时，也可和大家见面谈心拉家常，喜欢赶热闹的小孩就更是有事没事往食堂跑了。食堂对人们的生活是这样重要，关系是这样密切，就自然而然地成为一条无形的纽带，把习惯于个体生活的农民继生产上集体化之后，在生活上也维系成为一体。这是多么了不起的作用呵！
    新生事物是具有无限生命力的。在有些办得好的食堂，由于解决了吃菜问题，有的社员感到个人种菜已无必要，自动将自留地上缴。有些地方，住的较分散，到食堂往返不便，就纷纷搬居到食堂周围，自发地形成了一种集中的趋势，这就为将来建立新的“居民点”创造了前提条件。
    在历史的发展过程中，既然“以井为市”能导致私有制社会和个体生活的出现，那末，在历史的发展过程中，“以食堂而聚”也必然会导致公有制社会和集体生活的向更高更美好的阶段发展。
