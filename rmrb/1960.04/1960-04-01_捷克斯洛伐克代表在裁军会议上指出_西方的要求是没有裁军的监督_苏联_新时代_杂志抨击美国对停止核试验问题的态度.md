Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 30th: The Geneva Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting continued on the 30th. The meeting that day was presided over by the representative of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Tarabanov.

The Czechoslovak representative, Nosek, spoke at the meeting, discussing the Czechoslovak delegation's views on the future work of the Ten-Nation Committee. Nosek pointed out that the approach proposed by the Western delegations could not achieve the goal of complete and thorough disarmament. The Western countries' representatives demand that detailed measures for establishing a supervisory system be drafted first, which in effect means supervision without actual disarmament.

The Italian representative, Cavaletti, then spoke, defending the position of the Western representatives.

The next meeting will continue on the 31st.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 31st: A recent issue of "New Times" magazine published an editorial commenting on the new proposals put forward by the Soviet Union at the Three-Power Conference on the Discontinuation of Nuclear Weapon Tests. The editorial pointed out that if the Soviet Union's new proposals could be adopted, then an agreement banning nuclear explosions could likely be signed in the near future.

The editorial said that world public opinion is expecting an answer from the Western countries, especially the United States, but they are still hesitating. According to some bourgeois journalists, diplomats, and politicians, Washington and other Western capitals are full of doubts. The essence of these doubts is reflected in a "New York Times" editorial on March 27th. The newspaper's editorial said: "If we hope to achieve some success on the road to disarmament, then we need guarantees. In the current terrible historical stage, the only possible slogan is: 'Cash on the barrelhead, no credit.'"

The "New Times" magazine editorial went on to point out that this is not only the opinion of the New York newspaper editor, but also the official position of the U.S. State Department. This view is also revealed in the remarks of the Western representatives attending the Geneva conference. The editorial said that this view is bad because its purpose is obviously to make very ordinary problems complicated. In reality, in a world with a large number of armed forces, in a world where the arms race has reached the point where a new war could destroy a series of countries and continents, it is impossible to have such absolute guarantees: that some imperialist country will not try to take advantage of the other side's preparations for disarmament to invade the other side. But does this mean that because the world is armed to the teeth, it should continue to be trapped in a desperate situation and refuse to disarm? Does this mean that disarmament should be delayed in the future?

The editorial said that practical disarmament measures require a minimum of trust between countries. Of course, complete trust can only be achieved when all countries have thoroughly disarmed. However, the practice of international talks has proven that if one keeps one's finger on the trigger all the time, it is impossible to start implementing the task of disarmament.

    捷克斯洛伐克代表在裁军会议上指出
    西方的要求是没有裁军的监督
    苏联“新时代”杂志抨击美国对停止核试验问题的态度
    据新华社31日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦30日讯：日内瓦十国裁军委员会会议30日继续举行，这一天的会议由保加利亚人民共和国代表塔拉巴诺夫主持。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表诺塞克在会上发言，谈到捷克斯洛伐克代表团对十国委员会未来工作的意见。诺塞克指出，西方代表团提出的途径是不能达到全面彻底裁军的目的的。西方国家代表要求首先对建立监督制度拟定详细的措施，这实际上意味着没有实际裁军的监督。
    意大利代表卡瓦来蒂随后发言，为西方代表的立场辩解。
    下次会议在31日继续举行。
    新华社莫斯科31日电　最近一期“新时代”杂志发表社论，评苏联在三国不继续核武器试验会议上提出的新建议。社论指出，如果苏联的新建议能被采纳，那么，禁止核爆炸的协定很可能会在不远的将来签订。
    社论说，世界公众正在期望西方国家，首先是美国的回答，但是，它们还在犹豫不决。据某些资产阶级的新闻工作者、外交官员和政界人士说，华盛顿和西方其他国家的首都都充满着怀疑。“纽约时报”3月27日的社论中反映了这些怀疑的实质。这家报纸的社论说：“如果我们希望在裁军道路上取得某些成就，那么我们就需要有保障。在现今可怕的历史阶段上，唯一可能的口号是：要现钱，不赊账。”
    “新时代”杂志社论接着指出，这不仅是纽约报纸编辑的意见，这也是美国国务院官方的立场。在出席日内瓦会议的西方代表的言论中也流露出这种观点，社论说，这种观点是恶劣的。因为它的目的显然是要使非常普通的问题变得错综复杂。实际上，在拥有大量的武装部队的世界里，在军备竞赛达到一旦爆发新战争就可能消灭一系列国家和大陆的程度的世界里，不可能存在这种绝对的保障：即某个帝国主义国家不企图利用另一方准备裁军的机会来侵犯另一方。但是，这是否是说，因为世界武装到牙齿，它就要继续陷入绝境和拒绝裁军呢？这是否是说，今后还要拖延裁军呢？
    社论说，裁军的实际措施要求各国之间有起码的信任。当然，完全的信任只有当所有国家都彻底进行裁军时才能实现。但是，国际会谈的实践证明，如果时刻扳起枪机，那么，要着手去实现裁军任务是不可能的。
