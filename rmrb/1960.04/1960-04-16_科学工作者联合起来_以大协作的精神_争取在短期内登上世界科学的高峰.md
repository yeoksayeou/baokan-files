Chairman, fellow representatives:

We fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 Budget, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and express our firm support. The contents of the three vice premiers' reports are comprehensive explanations of the national economic plan and financial plan, and the agricultural plan. They are important political reports full of guiding significance. The reports fully embody the application of Mao Zedong Thought – the integration of Marxism-Leninism with Chinese practice – and guiding principles in our country's entire economic life. Therefore, it is even more worthy of our in-depth study and earnest implementation.

We are several middle-aged and older natural science workers. Since the anti-Rightist rectification movement, we have experienced the great victory of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in our country's construction undertakings, and witnessed the rapid development and great achievements on the scientific front. We feel very excited and extremely happy from the bottom of our hearts. Countless facts prove the unparalleled power of the mass line in scientific work, demonstrating that science can also grow in our country in a Great Leap Forward manner. At the same time, we have a deeper understanding that it is due to the Party's correct leadership, breaking superstitions, liberating thought, and launching mass movements, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, that China's science can have today's excellent situation, and only the Party's leadership can make China's scientific undertakings even greater.

Many tasks, which were previously thought to be considered for implementation in our country's conditions only after three to five years, have been successfully completed within a year or a few months through the research of the masses, especially the efforts of many young staff members, and have reached a relatively high level. Recently, a group of young researchers in the Geological Office of the Lanzhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, encouraged by the General Line, went all out and creatively proposed the geological theory that oil can also be formed in continental strata (strata deposited not in the ocean but in the lacustrine environment on the continent) by studying and analyzing a large number of geological exploration data from many oil exploration areas across the country since liberation. It has great practical significance for guiding future oil exploration work, which is a theoretical problem that geologists have not solved well for a long time. Similar examples have appeared in many scientific research institutions, industrial departments, and schools at all levels across the country. In addition, in terms of the allocation of new technologies and science, since the Great Leap Forward, through mass movements, progress has been rapid from scratch, and there have been even more achievements. These include electronic computers, electron microscopes, semiconductors, precision optical instruments, etc. There have been even greater developments in new technologies in factories and enterprises, and the completion of many projects was inconceivable in the past. However, through the efforts of the masses, they have been completed in a very short period.

In the face of the facts, we fully recognize this gratifying scientific situation. We welcome the new stage of scientific development in our country in the 1960s with infinite joy together with scientific workers all over the country, and wholeheartedly accept the scientific research tasks in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the country. We especially need to seize the time to study Chairman Mao's works and constantly improve our political and ideological level.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun has clearly stated in his report that the arrangement of the 1960 National Economic Plan is based on agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, so that the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture are combined with each other. In addition to sincerely supporting this important policy, we must also specifically arrange our own work and, together with the people of the whole country, take the responsibility of supporting the technological transformation of agriculture.

In the past few years, scientific workers have made many efforts on agricultural issues and have achieved considerable results. For example, in the research on improving agricultural production, focusing on the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, they have summarized the rich experience and creations of the vast number of farmers, including proposing reasonable ranges for the close planting of rice, wheat, cotton, and rapeseed in different regions; the depth range of reasonable deep plowing; providing data and measures for planting and fertilizing according to local soil conditions and soil improvement; solving some problems in crop diseases and insect pests and other agricultural technical problems. However, these works are still far behind the requirements of the situation for the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in our country. Not only is the work not done enough, but comprehensive scientific research targeting one or several major issues has been carried out even less.

Agricultural research involves not only the above-mentioned botany, soil science, entomology, etc., but also relates to a larger range of disciplines. In the process of agricultural technology transformation, there are also physics, meteorology, mechanics, chemistry, geology, engineering, medicine, and a series of other scientific issues. For example, there are problems with the application of rays and radioactive isotopes in the storage of agricultural products and rational fertilization; the selection of sowing and harvesting periods, and the prediction of hazardous weather are problems of agricultural meteorology; chemical fertilizer mineral raw materials, and the search for groundwater are geological problems, etc. Many of these problems are already being researched, but in order to adapt to the new situation and new requirements, it is necessary to further adopt a large-scale collaborative approach, expand the scope of scientific activities, and even create new branches of agricultural science. It is necessary to carry out mass movements on a large scale and strive to achieve the technological revolution in agricultural science and technology in our country in the shortest possible time and to strive for continuous leap forward.

The twelve-year scientific and technological development long-term plan is a grand plan put forward by the Party in 1956, and it is also the national important scientific and technological research task. The realization of this plan can rapidly strengthen the scientific and technological forces of our country and rapidly improve the level. For some important and urgently needed tasks and projects, it is required to approach or catch up with the international level within twelve years, so that many major scientific and technological problems in our socialist construction can be gradually solved by relying on our own strength, and lay a solid foundation for the science and technology of our country. Therefore, the early realization of this plan is an important link in accelerating the socialist construction of our country. Now, under the leadership of the Party, the working class and peasants of our country are launching a magnificent technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The Party's call to realize the twelve-year scientific and technological plan in a relatively short period during this period is very encouraging. After two years of the scientific Great Leap Forward, the foundation has been established, which is an important condition for completing the scientific plan ahead of schedule. Therefore, the Party's call is also very timely. We will all make our greatest efforts to work with the masses under the correct leadership of the Party, in accordance with the spirit of accelerating, accelerating again, leaping forward, and leaping forward again, to ensure the achievement of this goal. Climb to the peak of science.

Fellow representatives! This year is the first year of the 1960s, and science and technology will shine brightly in this era. In this era, socialist countries will be the protagonists leading the great development of science and technology. Our country will also get rid of the backward state of science and technology in this era and appear in the world as a most advanced socialist power with a high degree of culture and science. We, with infinite excitement, under the leadership of the Party, will work together with the people of the whole country to realize this great goal. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out that the banner of Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of victory. Therefore, as long as we study seriously and persistently, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly transform our world outlook, we will surely achieve victory.

    科学工作者联合起来　以大协作的精神  争取在短期内登上世界科学的高峰
    竺可桢、钱崇澍、钱学森、贝时璋、赵忠尧  童第周、刘崇乐、朱　洗、张　玺、张文裕郭永怀、董聿茂、王季午、陆士嘉、顾功叙代表的联合发言主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年预算的报告和谭震林副总理关于为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告并表示坚决拥护。三位副总理报告的内容是国家经济计划和财政计划、农业规划的全面说明，是富有指导意义的重要政治报告，报告中充分体现了毛泽东思想——马克思列宁主义同中国实践相结合的思想和指导原则在我们国家的整个经济生活中的运用，因此更值得我们深入地学习和认真贯彻。
    我们是几个中年以上的自然科学工作者，自反右整风运动以来，经历了我国建设事业全面大跃进的伟大胜利，见到了科学战线上的飞速发展和巨大成就。我们从内心感到非常振奋和万分高兴。有无数的事实，证明群众路线在科学工作中的无比威力，显示出科学也能以大跃进的方式在我国成长起来。同时更深刻体会到由于党对科学的正确领导，破除迷信，解放思想，大搞群众运动，在总路线的光辉照耀下，我国的科学才能出现今日的大好形势，也唯有党的领导才能使我国科学事业更加发扬光大。
    有许多工作，过去认为在我国的条件下，是三五年以后才能考虑进行的，但是经过群众的钻研，尤其是很多青年工作人员的努力，一年或者几个月内就成功了，而且达到较高的水平。最近中国科学院兰州分院地质室的一群青年研究人员，在总路线的鼓舞下，鼓足干劲，从研究分析全国自解放以来许多石油勘探地区的大量地质勘探资料中，经过一段时期的集体工作，创造性地提出了陆相岩层中（不是在海洋而是在大陆上湖泊的环境下沉积的岩层）也可以形成石油的地质理论，对于指导今后石油勘探工作具有很大的实际意义，而这正是长期以来地质学家们没有很好解决的理论问题。类似的事例在全国科学研究机构、工业部门和各级学校中已经出现不少。此外，在新技术科学配备方面，则自大跃进以来通过群众运动，从无到有，进展很快，成果更多。其中有如电子计算机、电子显微镜、半导体、精密光学仪器等等，工厂企业方面的新技术，则更有大量的发展，很多项目的做成，在过去来说是不可设想的，但是，经过群众的努力，在很短的时期内就做成了。
    在事实面前，我们完全认清了这种可喜的科学形势。我们以无限舒畅的心情和全国科学工作者一起来迎接六十年代我国科学发展的新阶段，全心全意接受国家在技术革新技术革命运动中的科学研究任务。我们特别要抓紧学习毛主席的著作，不断提高自己的政治思想水平。
    李富春副总理在报告中已经明确提出1960年国民经济计划的安排是以农业为基础，以工业为主导，使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合，我们除了衷心拥护这一重要方针外，还要具体安排自己的工作，和全国人民一道，负起支援农业技术改造的责任。
    在过去几年中，对于农业问题，科学工作者们虽曾做过不少努力，也取得了相当的成果，例如对提高农业生产的研究，围绕着农业“八字宪法”与广大农民一起，总结了他们的丰富经验和创造，其中有对不同地区的水稻、小麦、棉、油菜等作物的密植提出合理的幅度；合理深耕的深度范围；提供了各地因土种植施肥和土壤改良的资料和措施；解决了一些农作物病虫害方面的问题以及其他的不少农业技术问题。但是这些工作对我国农业生产大跃进来说还是远远落后于形势的要求，不仅工作还做得不够，针对一个或几个重大问题的综合性的科学研究，展开得更少。
    农业研究不仅涉及上述的植物学、土壤学、昆虫学等等，还联系到更大的学科范围。在农业技术改造的过程中，还有物理学，气象学，力学，化学，地质学，工程学，医学和一系列其他的科学问题。例如，关于农产品的储藏和合理施肥，有射线和放射性同位素的应用问题；播种收获时期的选择，危害天气的预告是农业气象学的问题；化学肥料矿物原料，地下水的寻找是地质学问题等等。很多这些问题已在进行研究中，但为适应新形势新要求，必须进一步采取大协作的方式，扩大科学活动的范围，甚至创立农业科学的新学门。必须大搞群众运动，为争取在最短期间内实现我国农业科学技术革命，持续跃进而奋斗。
    十二年科学技术发展远景规划是1956年党所提出的一个宏伟的规划，也是国家重要科学技术的研究任务。这个计划的实现，能使我国科学技术的力量迅速壮大，水平迅速提高，对某些重要和急需的任务项目，十二年内要求接近或赶上国际水平，这样就能使我们社会主义建设中许多重大科学技术问题，能够依靠自己的力量来逐步获得解决，并打下我国科学技术的牢固基础。所以这项规划的提早实现，是加速我国社会主义建设事业的一个重要环节。现在我国工农人民群众在党的领导下，正在展开波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动，党在这一时期提出在比较短的时期内实现十二年科学技术规划的号召，是非常振奋人心的。经过两年来的科学大跃进，基础已经建立起来，这是提前完成科学规划的重要条件，因此党的这一号召也是很及时的。我们都将以最大的努力与群众一起在党的正确领导下，按照加速再加速跃进再跃进的精神来保证达到这个目的。攀登上科学的高峰。
    各位代表！今年是二十世纪六十年代的第一年，科学技术将在这一年代里，大放异彩。在这一年代里社会主义国家将是领导科学技术大发展的主角，我们国家在这一年代里也将摆脱科学技术的落后状态，以一个最先进的具有高度文化科学的社会主义强国的面貌出现于世界，我们以无限兴奋的心情在党的领导下与全国人民一起，为实现这一伟大的目标而共同奋斗。李富春副总理指出毛泽东思想的旗帜就是胜利的旗帜，因此只要我们认真地持久地学习，以毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，彻底改造我们的世界观，我们一定会取得胜利。
