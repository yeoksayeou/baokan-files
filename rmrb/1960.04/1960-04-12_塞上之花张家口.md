	Zhangjiakou, Flower of the Borderland	Feng Jiannan
	Whenever the train on the Beijing-Baotou line approaches Zhangjiakou, the conductor always introduces this flower of the borderland to the passengers in an excited tone, and the passengers will also look at this red city with respectful eyes. Ah, Zhangjiakou, you are beautiful, you are a famous city that has undergone fierce tests of blood and fire! In 1921, not long after the founding of the Communist Party of China, it sent comrades such as Deng Zhongxia and He Mengxiong here. Soon, the workers' movement and revolutionary struggle in the Zhangjiakou area moved from spontaneous to conscious, and continuously achieved victories.
	Later, Zhangjiakou, which had suffered from the ravages of warlord melee, fell into white terror due to the Kuomintang's betrayal of the revolution. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working class and the masses of the people never ceased their struggle.
	Time passed in this way for ten years.
	In 1931, after the Japanese imperialists occupied Northeast China, they further invaded Chahar and eastern Hebei. Zhangjiakou became the forefront of the anti-Japanese war, attracting nationwide attention.
	Later, due to the non-resistance policy of the Kuomintang reactionary government, Zhangjiakou suffered profound disasters. The Japanese imperialists occupied Zhangjiakou for a long time, established the "Mengjiang" puppet government here, and cruelly enslaved, poisoned, and slaughtered the people of Inner Mongolia, Chahar, and Zhangjiakou. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people never yielded, and the battle never ceased for a single day.
	Another ten years passed.
	In 1945, at the command of "August 15th," the Soviet and Mongolian People's Republic allied forces fought in coordination with the Chinese people's army, giving the enemy a devastating blow in Langwogou, north of Zhangjiakou. On August 22, Zhangjiakou was liberated and became the seat of the CPC Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Government. However, just as the people of the whole country were cheering for the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and starting to rebuild their homes, the Kuomintang reactionaries broke their promises and launched a civil war in June 1946, launching a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas. Following Chairman Mao's strategic guiding principle of not counting gains or losses in one city or place and concentrating superior forces to eliminate the enemy's living forces, the People's Liberation Army voluntarily withdrew from Zhangjiakou in October of the same year.
	The reactionaries "celebrated victory" in self-intoxication. In fact, they had completely miscalculated. Two years later, our army launched a full-scale counter-offensive. On December 24, 1948, our army returned to Zhangjiakou and liberated Zhangjiakou forever. At that time, the masses rejoiced, and shouts of "Long live the people's city of Zhangjiakou!" were everywhere.
	From then until now, another ten years have passed.
	Ten years, another ten years, and these most recent ten years are different from any previous ten years. After these ten years, the people have swept away all the ugly and rotten things from this city and built a beautiful and prosperous Zhangjiakou.
	Ah, Zhangjiakou, let us climb the Chaoyang Pavilion on Taiping Mountain and take a look at you, this flower of the borderland.
	The ancient mountains surrounding Zhangjiakou are witnesses to history. From the Qin Shihuang Dynasty to the Chiang Kai-shek Dynasty, countless people who were forced to build fortifications for them and whipped to death were buried here. The mountains were also tortured by them to the point of being withered and lifeless. Every spring when the snow melted and every summer when it rained heavily, stones, mud, sand, and white bones flowed into the city together. Since liberation, trees have been planted every year and forests have been created every season. Now, the mountains and valleys are all green.
	Zhangjiakou is a bunch of red flowers in this green bush. Ah, look, there are red flags everywhere, red stars everywhere, red houses everywhere, and songs are floating everywhere.
	In the past ten years, Zhangjiakou has transformed from a dilapidated, consumer city into a clean and thriving industrial city. Ah, look at that wide, straight Industrial Street, look at the newly built prospecting machinery factory, coal mining machinery factory, farm implement manufacturing factory... Look at the Workers' Club in the city center, the Workers' Sanatorium by the Qingshui River! Ah, look a little further, look at the Longyan Iron Mine on Red Stone Mountain, where a total of only 190,000 tons of iron ore were produced from the time Duan Qirui was in power to the time the Japanese imperialists occupied it, while nearly 3 million tons of iron ore were produced in the single year of the Great Leap Forward in 1958.
	In the past ten years, Zhangjiakou has transformed from a city where Han people defrauded Mongolians and merchants exploited farmers and herdsmen into a city that centrally reflects the friendly relations between urban and rural areas and among fraternal ethnic groups. Railways and highways connect this city with the valleys, plains, and grasslands of this region into a flexible whole. It only takes a few hours to get from the city to the furthest reaches of the grasslands. Various industrial raw materials and precious products from the grasslands such as fur, mushrooms, milk powder, butter, Yuxian's white hemp, Xuanhua's grapes, Huailai's fruit, and boiled wine are transported to Zhangjiakou from all over the place. Various means of production and living materials are transported to the deep mountains and grasslands. The situation before liberation, when it took months to travel from inside the pass to outside the pass, and one had to risk wind, snow, black shops, bandits, and jackals, can now only be heard by children as a myth. Because the barren mountains and grasslands in this area have been greened, the climate in Zhangjiakou has also undergone great changes. Before liberation, Zhangjiakou was a city where "you wear leather in the morning, gauze in the evening, and eat watermelon around the stove"; now, the climate here is much better and warmer, the summers are extremely cool, and the spring winds and sand and winter snows have lost their previous power. The people of the Zhangjiakou area are working hard to transform the borderland into Jiangnan, and Zhangjiakou will further become a city with sunny weather and picturesque scenery.

### 塞上之花张家口

    塞上之花张家口	冯健男
    每当京包线上的列车驶近张家口的时候，列车员总要以激动的语调向旅客介绍这朵塞上之花，而旅客们也将以敬爱的眼光注视这个红色的城。呵，张家口，你是美丽的，你是经受过猛烈的血与火的考验的名城！1921年，中国共产党成立之后不久，就派了邓中夏、何孟雄等同志来了。很快，张家口地区的工人运动和革命斗争就从自发进入自觉，并且不断地取得胜利。
    以后，饱受了军阀混战之苦的张家口，又因为国民党的叛变革命而陷于白色恐怖之中。但是，在共产党的领导下，工人阶级和人民群众一刻也没有停止过斗争。
    时间就这样过去了十年。
    1931年，日本帝国主义者侵占了我国东北之后，进而侵入了察北和冀东，张家口成为全国瞩目的抗日前线。
    以后，由于国民党反动政府的不抵抗，张家口蒙受了深重的灾难。日本帝国主义者长期占领了张家口，在这里成立了“蒙疆”傀儡政府，残酷地奴役着、毒害着、屠杀着内蒙古、察哈尔和张家口人民；可是，在共产党的领导下，人民一刻也没有屈服，战斗一天也没有中止。
    时间又过去了十年。
    1945年，“八·一五”一声令下，苏联和蒙古人民共和国联军协同中国人民的军队作战，在张家口北狼窝沟给敌军以歼灭性打击。8月22日，张家口得到了解放，并且成为中共晋察冀中央局和晋察冀边区政府的所在地。可是，正当全国人民欢呼抗日胜利，着手重建家园的时候，国民党反动派背信弃义，于1946年6月发动内战，大举向解放区进攻。人民解放军遵循着毛主席不计一城一地得失，集中优势兵力消灭敌人有生力量的战略指导原则，于同年10月主动撤离张家口。
    反动派在自我陶醉中“庆祝胜利”。其实，他们的棋完全走错了。两年之后，我军全面转入反攻。1948年12月24日，我军回到了张家口，永远解放了张家口。当时万众欢腾，到处是“人民的城市张家口万岁！”的呼声。
    从那时到现在，时间又过去了十年。
    十年，又十年，最近的这十年不同于以往的任何十年。经过这十年，人民从这个城市中扫除了一切丑恶的、腐烂的东西，建成了美丽繁荣的张家口。
    呵，张家口，让我们登上太平山上的朝阳亭，看看你这塞上之花吧。
    张家口四围的古老的山峰，是历史的见证人。从秦始皇王朝到蒋介石王朝，其间不知埋葬了多少为他们修筑防御工事而劳累和被鞭鞑至死的人们。群山也被他们折磨得形容枯槁，毫无生机。每逢春日雪消，夏日暴雨，石头、泥沙和白骨，一同流入市中。解放以后，年年植树，季季造林，到现在，群山万壑，都已青青。
    张家口就是这万绿丛中的一束红花。呵，看呀，到处是红旗，到处是红星，到处是红色的房屋，到处飘荡着歌声。
    十年来，张家口由一个破烂的、消费的城市变成了一个整洁的、蒸蒸日上的工业城市。呵，你看那宽阔的、笔直的工业大街，你看那新建的探矿机械厂、煤矿机械厂、农具制造厂……你看那市中心的工人俱乐部，清水河边的工人疗养院！呵，你再看远一点，看那红石山上的龙烟铁矿，在那里，从段祺瑞执政的时候到日本帝国主义者侵占的时候，一共只出铁矿石十九万吨，而在大跃进的1958年一年之中，就出铁矿石近三百万吨。
    十年来，张家口由一个汉人讹诈蒙民、商人剥削农民和牧民的城市变成了一个集中地反映了城乡之间、兄弟民族之间的友好关系的城市。铁路和公路把这个城市和这个地区的山谷、平川和草原连成了一个灵活的整体，从市内到草原的最远处也只消几个钟头；各种工业原料和草原上的皮毛、口蘑、奶粉、黄油，蔚县的白麻，宣化的葡萄，怀来的水果和煮酒等珍贵的产品，源源从各地运到张家口来；各种生产资料和生活资料源源运到深山中和草原上去。解放以前的那种从口上到口外要走几个月，并且要担风雪、黑店、土匪和豺狼之险的情况，现在的儿童只能当作神话来听了。由于这个地区的荒山和草原都已绿化，张家口的气候也有了很大的变化。解放以前，张家口是一个“早穿皮、晚穿纱、围着火炉吃西瓜”的城市；现在，这里的气候已经好得多了，暖和得多了，夏日极为凉爽，春天的风砂和冬天的风雪已经失去了以往的威力。张家口地区的人民正在努力变塞外为江南，张家口也将进一步变成风和日丽、江山如画的城市。
