Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 17th: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions recently issued a statement angrily protesting the South African Union government's continued persecution of Africans.

The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on workers, trade unionists, and trade union organizations around the world to fully support the heroic struggle of the South African people. The statement points out that the powerful strength of the international working class should make the South African government and all those who advocate for apartheid and racial discrimination realize that it is impossible to implement such policies in the world today.

The World Federation of Trade Unions finally expressed its deep conviction that, thanks to the increasingly broad support of the people of the world, the heroic struggle of the South African people will surely be victorious, and the policy of racial discrimination will be abolished forever.
