The 1960 National Economic Plan
Is Still a Great Leap Forward Situation
Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and support the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan and the draft of the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on "Striving to Realize the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule" and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report of the CPPCC Standing Committee. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: In 1959, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of all ethnic groups in our country adhered to the general line of socialist construction, adhered to the development speed of the Great Leap Forward, adhered to the people's communes, launched a mass movement of anti-rightist, boosting morale, increasing production and practicing economy, and completed the Second Five-Year National Economic Plan three years ahead of schedule. In this way, we completed the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan on the basis of the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, and freed up our hands to seize other tasks in the three years from 1960 to 1962 and achieve greater achievements. Therefore, our country's national economic construction undertakings and cultural, educational, health, scientific research and other undertakings have all achieved comprehensive and great development. From the national economic development indicators mentioned in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report, it can be affirmed that the national economic construction in 1960 is still a leap forward situation. How exciting and encouraging this is! Our country's national economic construction is under the glorious light of the Party's general line of building socialism, giving priority to the development of heavy industry, driving other industries, developing both heavy industry and appropriately developing light industry, and developing both industry and vigorously supporting agriculture at the same time. The implementation of the national economic development plan over the past few years has proved that the policy of taking steel as the key link in industry and grain as the key link in agriculture is completely correct. According to the figures in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report, the development speed of various industrial and agricultural sectors in 1960 is a Great Leap Forward. Steel production increased by about 5 million tons compared with 1959, reaching 18.4 million tons, an increase of 38% compared with 1959. Coal production reached 425 million tons, an increase of 22% compared with 1959. In agriculture, both grain and cotton increased by 10% compared with 1959. The reason why our country can achieve such a large increase is that we have the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the general line of socialist construction, and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, which both develop large-scale industries and develop small local and small foreign group enterprises. This combination of large, medium and small, and local and foreign methods, ensures that we continue to achieve the Great Leap Forward. Our adoption of the whole people running industry is to mobilize the broad masses of the people across the country to jointly engage in industry, so that we can develop our various constructions at a high speed. We have not only achieved such great achievements in industry, but also have the possibility of completing the forty articles of the agricultural development program two or three years ahead of schedule in agriculture. At the same time, the state conducts comprehensive arrangements for the main agricultural products: grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, medicine and miscellaneous twelve kinds, focuses on development, and makes proportional layout. We will support agriculture with great strength, because agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. According to the experience of the past few years, any year when agriculture has a bumper harvest leads to the great development of industry. Therefore, the Party's policy of building socialism by developing both industry and agriculture is completely correct.

    Industry and agriculture are developing rapidly in tandem
    Since the small local (foreign) group enterprises blossomed everywhere from 1958 to 1959, after more than two years of consolidation and improvement, the small local groups have now been raised to the level of small foreign groups. Taking steel as an example, each cubic meter of small blast furnace (below 100 cubic meters) can produce 2 tons of iron, and some have even reached higher yields. Their utilization coefficient and product quality have approached or exceeded those of large foreign groups, and their costs have also been greatly reduced. All this eloquently proves that the policy of combining local and foreign methods and walking on two legs is necessary and correct. In terms of steel production, the output of small converters accounts for more than half of the total output of large foreign steel, which is equal to more than one-third of the total steel output of the country; in terms of iron production, the output of small blast furnaces is now equal to the total output of large foreign blast furnaces, which accounts for half of the total iron output of the country. In the production of coal coke and cement, the Red Flag No. 2 and No. 3 coking furnaces and small cement kilns all play an important role. Therefore, this small local (foreign) group leg is a strong leg and has played a huge role.

    In 1960, the situation of the leap forward in our country's national economy is very good. The total industrial output value in the first quarter increased by about 80% compared with the same period last year, achieving a good start, and at the same time, a vigorous and magnificent mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution was launched. This movement swept the country as soon as it started and achieved great results. It will continue every year in the future. The production level has been greatly improved, and labor productivity has also increased greatly. Many enterprises have achieved increased production with fewer people or without increasing people, and even increased production with fewer people. Therefore, these brilliant achievements guarantee the realization of the Great Leap Forward in the national economy in 1960. Since the rural people's communes, after rectification and consolidation, have shown their great superiority in agricultural production. This year, there are also urban people's commune industries and urban street industries. This will more powerfully support the national economic construction and production. In this way, the great strength of the masses can be universally mobilized, greatly increased production, and ensure that our country's national economy continues to leap forward in 1960. All this is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of Chinese revolution and construction. Mao Zedong's Thought is a major development of Marxism-Leninism, just like Lenin made a major development of Marxism. Mao Zedong's Thought is the thought that combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of Chinese revolution. Therefore, I fully understand why we should study Mao Zedong Thought, study Chairman Mao's works, and why we should hold high the banner of Mao Zedong.

    In addition, our Party pointed out in agriculture: we should focus on the "Eight-Character Charter" of agriculture and the "Four Modernizations" of agriculture. In the people's communes, we should implement the five-in-one components of industry, agriculture, commerce, education and military, and carry out comprehensive production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline and fishery. In this way, our country's industry, agriculture and other undertakings can have a more rational layout and more comprehensive arrangements, so that the forty articles of the agricultural development program can be realized ahead of schedule, and the high-speed development of industry can be coordinated. Therefore, taking steel as the key link in industry to drive other industries, taking grain as the key link in agriculture to coordinate other agricultural products, and taking pigs as the main livestock, which not only provides meat but also provides more fertilizer, can not only promote the rapid development of agriculture itself, but also promote the rapid development of industry. This is the great role of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture.

    Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the socialist construction of the motherland has made great achievements, and it is inevitable that there will be some temporary unbalanced shortcomings (such as tight supply of non-staple food, etc.). These small shortcomings are the relationship between one finger and nine fingers, some have been overcome, and some are being overcome. Right-leaning opportunists are taking this opportunity to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, which is with ulterior motives. These unbalanced situations are inevitable phenomena in the development process. Because, in the process of progress, there will always be contradictions in certain proportional relationships (the so-called temporary "proportional imbalances"), and solving one contradiction will lead to a new contradiction. By constantly solving contradictions and constantly solving new contradictions, we will continue to move forward.

    It can be seen from the national budget that
Our country is engaged in peaceful construction

    In his report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget, Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out: Our country's financial work has also entered a new situation with the leap forward in production. The characteristics of this new situation are: more income, more expenditure, more construction; more income, more expenditure, more construction will reasonably save funds, ensure the high-speed development of the national economy, and maintain the balance of financial revenue and expenditure. Since 1958, the implementation of financial and economic affairs has been: the proportion of expenditures on economic construction and cultural construction in the entire financial expenditure has gradually increased. The average was 63.9% during the First Five-Year Plan, while the average was 79.6% in 1958 and 1959; the proportion of defense expenditures and administrative expenses in the entire financial expenditure decreased year by year. The average of these two items was 30.9% during the First Five-Year Plan, while the average was 17% in 1958 and 1959. The 1960 budget was further reduced to 12.8%, of which defense expenditure accounted for only 8.3%. The first meeting of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the proposal on the Second Five-Year Plan, once proposed that during the Second Five-Year Plan, the proportion of economic and cultural construction expenditures must be increased to 60% to 70%, and the proportion of military expenditure and administrative management costs should be reduced to about 20%. This requirement has been realized three years ahead of schedule and even better. In 1960, 81.9% of the national budget expenditure was used for economic construction and cultural construction. This is a major feature of our national budget. In the entire budget expenditure, the proportion of defense expenditure is only 8.3%, and it has been gradually decreasing over the years. This fact can fully illustrate that our great motherland is actively engaged in the construction of peaceful undertakings, and our people are truly peace-loving. In contrast, according to the published figures: British military expenditure was 768 million pounds from 1948 to 1949; 1.42 billion pounds from 1957 to 1958; 1.465 billion pounds from 1958 to 1959; 1.514 billion pounds from 1959 to 1960; and 1.629 billion pounds from 1960 to 1961. It can be clearly seen that British military expenditure is increasing year by year. At present, the absolute number of British military expenditure has more than doubled compared with 1948 to 1949, accounting for 33% of the current total budget, while American military expenditure accounts for 57.1% of the total budget, French military expenditure accounts for more than 25%, and West German military expenditure accounts for 24%. Therefore, from the percentage and absolute figures of the budget, compared with capitalist countries, our country's defense expenditure is the smallest number. This ruthlessly exposes the face of false peace and true war preparation of American and British imperialism. US President Eisenhower's attempt to decorate his war preparation policy with a false peace posture is futile and cannot deceive the eyes of the people all over the world.

  Old scientists and senior intellectuals,
    Should learn from the ambition of young people
    The current situation is very favorable to us. Whether in industrial and agricultural production, or in water conservancy and other construction projects, we can achieve comprehensive indicators of high yield, high quality, low consumption, multiple varieties, and low cost. We have full confidence that in the movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, we can climb to the most advanced peak in the world in production, technology and scientific research. As long as we adhere to the Party's leadership in this regard, adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to carrying out mass movements on a large scale, conscientiously implement the policy of five simultaneities and three combinations, fully promote the communist style, leave difficulties to ourselves, give convenience to others, promote the noble communist cooperation of "everyone for me, I for everyone", accelerate the development of heavy industry, vigorously support agriculture, and actively develop culture, education, science, health, sports and other undertakings, we will comprehensively make our country's national economic undertakings achieve greater and more brilliant achievements.

    What is more important for us is to study Chairman Mao's works, actively further improve our ideological understanding, understand Chairman Mao's creative great thoughts, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, widely mobilize the strength of the masses, and carry out the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution on a large scale and in depth. In our group, there are many elderly scientists and senior intellectuals. In the Great Leap Forward, we have seen the young comrades full of soaring energy, high morale, and magnificent spirit, contributing all their strength to the country. They dedicate their youth to the country, full of a high degree of communist labor spirit. Our older generation should also dedicate this remaining life to the motherland, promote the early arrival of communism, and promote the realization of communism before we die. Therefore, let us old scientists and senior intellectuals actively learn from the young masses, learn from the great spirit and ambition of the young people, so that the old and young comrades in the country will be closely united around the Party and strive to realize the communist cause ahead of schedule!

    祖国跃进景象令人欢欣鼓舞
    侯德榜委员的发言
      1960年国民经济计划
    仍然是个大跃进的局面主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意并拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案和关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告、谭震林副总理关于“为提前实现全国农业发展纲要四十条而奋斗”的报告和陈叔通副主席政协常务委员会的工作报告。李富春副总理在报告中指出：1959年，我国各族人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，坚持了社会主义建设的总路线，坚持了大跃进的发展速度，坚持了人民公社，开展了反右倾、鼓干劲，增产节约的群众性运动，提前了三年完成第二个五年国民经济计划。这样，我们就在1958年和1959年两年中持续大跃进的基础上，完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，并在1960年至1962年三年中腾出手来抓紧其他，取得更大的成就。因此，我国国民经济建设事业和文化、教育、卫生、科学研究等事业，都获得了全面的大发展。从李富春副总理报告中所提到的国民经济发展的指标来看，可以肯定，1960年的国民经济建设仍然是一个跃进的局面。这是多么令人兴奋和鼓舞的事！我们国家的国民经济建设，是在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，优先发展重工业，带动其他各项工业，既发展重工业，又适应地发展轻工业，既发展工业又同时大力支援农业。从几年来国民经济发展计划的执行情况证明：在工业方面以钢为纲，在农业方面以粮为纲的方针是完全正确的。根据李富春副总理报告的数字，1960年各项工农业发展的速度都是大跃进的。钢产量比1959年增加了五百万吨左右达到一千八百四十万吨，比1959年增长了38％。煤炭产量达到四亿二千五百万吨，比1959年增加了22％。在农业方面，粮食和棉花都比1959年增加了10％。我们国家所以能够作到这样大幅度的增长，是因为我们有党和毛主席的英明领导，有社会主义建设的总路线，有一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，既发展大型工业，也发展了小土、小洋群的企业。这大、中、小并举，土、洋法结合，就保证我们不断地取得大跃进。我们采取全民办工业，就是发动全国广大群众来共同搞工业，这样，就可以使我们各项建设高速度的发展。我们不仅在工业上取得了这么大的成就，而且，在农业方面，也有可能提前二、三年完成农业发展纲要四十条。同时，国家对农业主要的产品：粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂十二种都进行全面安排，重点发展，作出按比例的布局。我们将以很大的力量支援农业，因为农业是国民经济的基础。根据几年来的经验，凡是在农业丰产丰收的那一年，就导致了工业的大发展。所以，党的建设社会主义的工农业并举的方针，是完全正确的。
    工农业双双飞速发展
    自1958年至1959年小土（洋）群企业遍地开花后，经过两年多来的巩固和提高，现在小土群已提高到小洋群的水平。以钢来说，每立方米的小高炉（一百立方米以下的）容积可产到二吨铁，甚至有的已经达到更高的产量。它们的利用系数、产品的质量都已经接近或超过大洋群，成本也已大大降低。这一切都雄辩地证明了土洋并举、两条腿走路的方针是必要的和正确的。在钢的生产方面，小转炉产量占了大洋钢的总产量一半以上，就是等于全国钢的总产量三分之一以上；在铁的生产方面，小高炉的产量现已与大洋高炉的总产量相等，即占全国铁的总产量的一半。在煤焦、水泥等生产方面，红旗二、三号炼焦炉和小型水泥窑都起着重要作用。所以，这小土（洋）群一腿是一个强有力的腿，发挥了巨大的作用。
    1960年，我国国民经济跃进的形势是好的很。第一季度的工业总产值比去年同期增长了约80％，实现了开门红，同时掀起了声势浩大，气魄磅礴的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，这一运动刚一开始就席卷了全国，取得了很大的成绩。今后将年年继续。生产水平大大提高，劳动生产率也有很大的增长，很多企业实现了增产少增人或不增人，甚至增产减人的现象。因此，这些光辉灿烂的成就，就保证了1960年国民经济大跃进的实现。自农村人民公社化以后，经过整顿和巩固，在农业生产中已显示了它的巨大优越性。今年更有城市的人民公社工业和城市街道工业。这就更有力地支援了国民经济建设和生产。这样，就可以普遍地调动群众的伟大力量，大大增产，保证我国国民经济1960年继续跃进的局面。这一切都是马列主义的普遍真理与中国革命建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。毛泽东同志的思想是马列主义重大的发展，也像列宁对马克思主义作了一个重大发展那样。毛泽东思想是马列主义的普遍真理同中国革命实践相结合的思想。所以，我完全理解为什么我们要学习毛泽东思想，学习毛主席的著作，为什么要高举毛泽东旗帜。
    此外，我们党在农业方面指出：要着重农业的“八字宪法”和农业的“四化”的工作。在人民公社方面要贯彻工、农、商、学、兵五位一体的成分，进行农、林、牧、副、渔综合性的生产。这样，我国工业、农业和其他各项事业就可以有更合理的布局，更全面的安排，使农业发展纲要四十条提前实现，配合工业的高速度的发展。所以，工业以钢为纲，带动其他工业，农业以粮为纲，配合其他各种农产品，六畜以猪为主，既有肉食又多肥料，不仅可以使农业本身迅速的发展，同时也可以促进工业的飞速发展。这就是工农业同时并举的伟大作用。
    自从1958年大跃进以来，祖国社会主义建设取得了极大的成就，也不免带来一些暂时不平衡的缺点（如副食品供应紧张等等）。这些小缺点是一个指头与九个指头的关系，有的已经克服，有的正在克服之中。右倾机会主义分子借此向党猖狂进攻，是别有用心的。这些不平衡情况正是发展过程中不可避免的一些现象。因为，在前进中总会发生某些比例关系的矛盾（所谓暂时的“比例失调”），解决了一个矛盾，就会出现一个新的矛盾。这样不断地解决矛盾，又不断解决新的矛盾，就会使我们不断地向前迈进。
    从国家预算中，可以看出
  我国正在从事和平建设事业
    李先念副总理在关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告中指出：我国财政工作随着生产的跃进，也进入了一个新的局面。这个新的局面的特点是：多收入，多支出，多建设；更多的收入，更多的支出，更多的建设，就会合理地节约资金，既保证国民经济的高速度发展，又保持财政收支的平衡。自从1958年以来，财政经济的执行情况是：经济建设和文化建设的支出在整个财政支出中所占的比例逐渐增加了。第一个五年计划期间平均为63.9％，而1958年和1959年平均为79.6％；国防费和行政费在整个财政支出中所占的比例则逐年下降。第一个五年计划期间这两项平均为30.9％而1958年和1959年平均为17％。1960年的预算更减至12.8％，其中国防费只占8.3％。党的第八次全国代表大会第一次会议，关于第二个五年计划的建议中曾经提出，在第二个五年计划中，必须使经济文化建设支出的比重提高到60％到70％，军费和行政管理费用的比重下降到20％左右。这个要求，已经提前三年，并且更好地实现了。在1960年，国家预算支出中，有81.9％用于经济建设和文化建设方面。这是我们国家预算的重大特点。在整个预算支出中，国防费所占的比重仅为8.3％，而且是几年来一直逐步下降的。这个事实，可以充分的说明我们伟大的祖国是积极从事和平事业建设的，我们人民是真正爱好和平的。与此相反，据已公布的数字：英国军费1948年到1949年为七点六八亿英镑；1957年到1958年为十四点二亿英镑；1958年到1959年为十四点六五亿英镑；1959年到1960年为十五点十四亿英镑；1960年到1961年为十六点二九亿英镑，可以明显地看出英国的军费是逐年增加的。目前，英国的军费绝对数字，已比1948年到1949年增加了一倍以上了，占现在的总预算额的33％，而美国军费是占总预算额的57.1％，法国军费占百分之二十五多一点，西德军费占24％。所以，从预算的百分率及绝对的数字上，与资本主义国家比较，我国国防费的支出是最小的数字。这就无情地揭露了美、英帝国主义的假和平、真备战的面目。美国总统艾森豪威尔以假和平的姿态来粉饰他的备战政策是徒劳的，是欺骗不了全世界人民的眼睛的。
  年老的科学家和高级知识分子，
    应当学习青年们的雄心壮志
    目前形势对我们是非常有利，无论在工业和农业生产方面，无论在水利和其他各项建设方面，都能取得高产、优质、低消耗、多品种、低成本的全面的指标。我们有满怀信心，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，把生产、技术和科学研究工作都能够攀登世界最先进的高峰。只要在这方面坚持党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，坚持大搞群众运动，认真地贯彻五个并举和三个结合的方针，充分地发扬共产主义风格，把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人，发扬“人人为我，我为人人”的高尚的共产主义大协作，加速发展重工业，大力支援农业，积极地发展文化、教育、科学、卫生、体育等事业，就一定会全面地使我们国家的国民经济各项事业取得更大的更辉煌的成绩。
    我们更重要的是要学习毛主席的著作，积极地进一步提高我们的思想认识，体会毛主席创造性的伟大思想，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，广泛地动员群众的力量，大规模地深入地开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命的运动。在我们的团体中，有不少年高的老科学家和高级知识分子。我们在大跃进当中已看到年青的同志们鼓足冲天干劲、斗志昂扬、气魄磅礴，尽其一切力量为国家作出贡献。他们把青春贡献给国家，满怀充沛着高度共产主义的劳动精神。我们年老的一代也应将这余生贡献给祖国，促使共产主义早日到来，促使我们生前看到共产主义的实现。所以，让我们年老的科学家和高级知识分子，积极地向青年群众看齐，学习青年们的伟大气魄和雄心壮志，使全国的老年和青年同志紧密地团结在党的周围，为提前实现共产主义事业而奋斗！
