Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, 12th—Heads of delegations from various countries attending the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference spoke at the conference on the afternoon of the 11th. Tennyson Makiwane, a South African representative and leader of the African National Congress, criticized the recent massacre of unarmed Africans by the South African federal government. He said that no matter what cruel measures the South African government takes, it will not stop our struggle for freedom and justice from advancing. Masaharu Hatanaka, head of the Japanese delegation, said that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" signifies a new U.S.-Japan military alliance. Japan is taking the path of reviving militarism and engaging in imperialist overseas expansion, combined with the revival of West German militarism in Europe, which poses a serious threat to world peace. The Japanese people resolutely oppose the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." We will never allow ourselves to become a pawn of U.S. imperialism, and we cannot remain silent about our country being led down the path of militarist revival. He demanded the immediate withdrawal of U.S. armed forces stationed in Japan, Okinawa, Chinese territory Taiwan, and South Korea.

Welbeck, head of the Ghanaian delegation and Minister Without Portfolio of Ghana, called on the African people to be vigilant against the imperialists' "divide and rule" policy. He said that imperialists are now doing everything possible to sow discord and create disputes among the people of African countries, in an attempt to weaken their struggle against imperialism. He said that the unity of all African people is in our common interest. If any part of Africa remains under the oppression of colonial rule, then the independence of any African country will not be complete.

Representatives from Basutoland, South Africa, and Libya emphasized the importance of Asian-African people's unity in the anti-imperialist struggle and called for further strengthening understanding and cooperation between Asian and African countries.

Han Xueye, head of the Korean delegation, said that U.S. imperialists have rejected all proposals for peaceful reunification of Korea put forward by the Korean government, and are stepping up turning South Korea into a military base. South Korea has become the most dangerous hotbed for another war. He called on the conference to force the United States to withdraw its armed forces from South Korea in order to ease the tension in Korea and the Far East and pave the way for unifying the two parts of Korea.

Tsevegmid, head of the Mongolian delegation, expressed the support of the Mongolian people and government for the struggle of the Asian and African people for independence and unity.

Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, 12th—The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held a plenary session on the afternoon of the 12th, continuing with speeches by heads of delegations from various countries.

Ismail Touré, head of the Guinean delegation and Minister of Public Works of Guinea, said in his speech, "The call issued at the Bandung Conference has resonated throughout Asia and has been concretely embodied; it will also resonate in Africa on a broad scale and be implemented."

He said, "In fact, it must always be remembered that the enemy of our great revival remains imperialism and all the political, economic, cultural, and ideological weapons used by imperialism, and the inevitable consequences of imperialist rule are ignorance, hunger, and disease. Faced with such an enemy, we will continue to fight until the final victory, and we will never stop halfway."

Dr. Frantz Fanon, the Algerian representative, said in his speech, "The Algerian revolution, because it embodies the spontaneous aspirations of the Algerian people and because it has received enthusiastic support from international public opinion, is a force that must be taken seriously." He said, "It is obvious that the true aim of the French government is to destroy the Algerian revolution. But everyone knows that the revolution cannot be extinguished, especially the Algerian revolution."

He said, "The French government's response to our proposals is to declare a long-term continuation of the war. In this case, we want to say that the prospect of a long-term war does not frighten us."

He said, "We would also like to add that we find it difficult to agree with the neutral attitude that some countries still take on the Algerian war. In our view, our just struggle should be supported by all good people."

Ben Barka, the Moroccan representative, said, "There can be no world peace as long as colonial wars continue and economic exploitation and racial rule still exist."

He said, "Therefore, we should make resolutions at this conference that can eliminate the dangers of neo-colonialism, which preserves the structure of colonialism intact and all the possibilities for implementing imperialist exploitation."

The head of the Kenyan delegation condemned British colonial rule in Kenya. Referring to the recent "Constitutional Conference" on Kenya held in London, he said, "The results of this conference were some hypocritical words and some hesitant measures. On the surface, it seems that some changes have taken place. However, since this change is based on the deceptive policy of so-called gradual progress toward independence, it is clear that what the imperialists need is nothing more than to buy time to strengthen their colonialist forces. Therefore, Kenya has entered a new stage in the struggle against new forms of colonialism." He said, "Today, American capital and financial groups are helping white colonialists suppress the African people in South Africa, are helping the French massacre the Algerian and Cameroonian people, and are helping the British and others establish military bases in Kenya."

He demanded the immediate and unconditional release of Jomo Kenyatta and other imprisoned political prisoners, demanded condemnation of the establishment of NATO military bases in Kenya and the immediate withdrawal of these bases, and demanded that the British must recognize the inalienable rights of the Kenyan people.

In his speech, Moumié, head of the Cameroonian delegation, said, "First of all, I think that the anti-imperialist orientation of the Asian-African solidarity movement should be reiterated with the greatest force. Second, we must force the imperialists to stop supporting puppet governments, racist governments, and governments like France that continue to wage colonial wars through such struggles. Not only that, the people of Asian and African countries should organize volunteer army columns to liberate the last piece of land in our two continents of Asia and Africa from imperialist military occupation."

Referring to the situation in Cameroon, Moumié said that French and American imperialists have once again disregarded the peaceful and democratic solutions to the Cameroonian question that we have proposed. In this case, our only solution is to fight to the end. To this end, we advocate the establishment of a provisional revolutionary government.

Mirzo Tursunzoda, head of the Soviet delegation, said that the growing anti-colonialist sweeping tide has swept across Asia and many African countries. We are pleased to salute the Asian and African people who have restored or have fought for their independence. The Soviet people fully understand that the people who have suffered from colonial slavery for a long time cannot ensure their happiness without fully restoring political independence. However, the people of all countries must not only strive for their political independence but also strive for their economic independence. It is necessary to strengthen economic cooperation between our countries and create appropriate conditions for establishing economic relations between Asian and African countries and other countries in the world.

Mrs. Rameshwar Nehru, head of the Indian delegation, condemned the conspiracies of imperialists in Asian and African countries, such as revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," occupying China's territory Taiwan, conducting atomic tests in the Sahara, and recently massacring Africans in South Africa. She pointed out that such activities threaten the peace of Asia, Africa, and the world. She called on the people of Asian and African countries to strengthen their unity.

    各国代表在亚非人民团结大会上同声强调
    必须坚决斗争把帝国主义赶出亚非大陆
    日朝代表谴责美国的备战活动　非洲国家代表揭露美国的殖民政策
    据新华社科纳克里12日电　出席亚非人民团结大会的一些国家的代表团团长11日下午在会上讲了话。南非代表、非洲人国民大会领袖之一坦尼逊·马基瓦恩发言时指责南非联邦政府最近屠杀手无寸铁的非洲人。他说，不论南非政府采取怎样残酷的措施，都制止不住我们争取自由和正义的斗争前进。日本代表团团长畑中政春说，新的日美“安全条约”意味着新的美日军事同盟。日本正在走复活军国主义并且进行帝国主义海外扩张的道路，同欧洲西德军国主义复活结合在一起，这就对世界和平构成了严重威胁。日本人民坚决反对新的日美“安全条约”。我们决不容许自己成为美帝国主义的爪牙，我们对我们的国家被引导走上军国主义复活的道路也不能保持沉默。他要求驻在日本、冲绳岛、中国领土台湾和南朝鲜的美国武装部队立即撤退。
    加纳代表团团长、加纳不管部长韦尔贝克要求非洲人民对帝国主义的“分而治之”政策保持警惕。他说，帝国主义者现在千方百计地在非洲各国人民之间散布不和、制造纠纷，企图以此来削弱他们反对帝国主义的斗争。他说，所有非洲人民的团结是我们的共同利益。如果非洲任何部分仍然处在殖民统治的压迫之下，那么任何一个非洲国家的独立将不是彻底的。
    巴苏陀兰、南非和利比亚的代表强调亚非人民在反帝斗争中团结的重要性，并要求进一步加强亚非国家之间的谅解和合作。
    朝鲜代表团团长韩雪野说，美帝国主义者拒绝朝鲜政府提出的和平统一朝鲜的一切建议，而加紧把南朝鲜变为一个军事基地。南朝鲜已成为另一次战争的最危险的温床。他要求大会迫使美国从南朝鲜撤出它的武装部队，以缓和朝鲜和远东的紧张局势，并为统一朝鲜的两个部分铺平道路。
    蒙古代表团团长策维格米德表示蒙古人民和政府支持亚非各国人民争取独立和团结的斗争。
    据新华社科纳克里12日电　第二届亚非人民团结大会12日下午举行全体会议，继续由各国代表团团长发言。
    几内亚代表团团长、几内亚公共工程部长伊斯梅尔·杜尔在讲话中说，“在万隆会议上发出的呼声，已经在亚洲各地引起了反响，并且已经得到具体的体现；它也将在广阔的规模上在非洲引起反响而付诸实现”。
    他说，“事实上，必须时刻记住，我们的伟大的复兴的敌人，仍然是帝国主义以及帝国主义所使用的政治、经济、文化和思想方面的一切武器，而帝国主义统治给我们带来的不可避免的后果就是愚昧、饥饿和疾病。面对着这样的敌人，我们将继续斗争，直到最后的胜利，决不中途收兵。”
    阿尔及利亚代表凡农博士在讲话中说，“阿尔及利亚革命，由于它体现了阿尔及利亚人民的自发的愿望、由于它得到国际舆论的热烈支持，所以是人们必须重视的一支力量。他说，“显而易见，法国政府的真正目的，是要摧毁阿尔及利亚革命。但是大家知道，革命是扑灭不了的，尤其是阿尔及利亚革命是扑灭不了的”。
    他说，“法国政府对我们的建议的答复是宣告长期继续进行战争。在这种情况下，我们要说，进行长期战争的前景是吓不倒我们的”。
    他说，“我们还要补充一句：我们很难同意一些国家在对待阿尔及利亚战争问题上仍然采取的中立的态度。在我们看来，我们所进行的正义斗争，应该得到一切善良人们的支持”。
    摩洛哥代表本·巴尔卡说，“只要殖民主义战争在继续进行、经济剥削和种族统治还存在的时候，就不可能有世界和平”。
    他说，“因此我们应该在这次大会上作出这样的一些决议，从而能够消除新殖民主义的危险，这种新殖民主义原封不动地保持着殖民主义的结构以及实行帝国主义剥削的一切可能性。”
    怯尼亚代表团团长指责英国在怯尼亚的殖民统治。他在谈到前不久在伦敦举行的关于怯尼亚的“宪法会议”时说，“这次会议的结果是一些假仁假义的词句和一些犹豫不决的措施。在表面上看来，好像是起了一些变化。但是，既然这种变化所根据的是所谓逐渐走向独立的欺骗政策，所以，显而易见，帝国主义者所需要的，无非是争取时间来加强他们的殖民主义势力。因此，怯尼亚进入了反对新形式的殖民主义的斗争的一个新阶段。”他说，“今天，美国资本和金融集团正在帮助白种殖民主义者镇压南非的非洲人民，正在帮助法国人屠杀阿尔及利亚人民和喀麦隆人民，正在帮助英国人和其他人在怯尼亚建立军事基地”。
    他要求立即无条件释放肯雅塔以及其他被囚禁的政治犯，要求谴责北大西洋公约组织在怯尼亚建立军事基地，并立即撤出这些基地，同时要求英国人必须承认怯尼亚人民的不能剥夺的权利。
    喀麦隆代表团团长穆米埃在讲话中说，“首先我认为，应该极其有力地重申亚非团结运动的反帝方针。第二，我们必须通过这样的斗争来迫使帝国主义者停止给予傀儡政府、种族主义政府以及像法国那样继续进行殖民战争的政府以支持。不仅如此，亚非各国人民应该组织志愿军纵队，来把我们亚非两洲的最后一块土地从帝国主义者的军事占领下解放出来”。
    穆米埃在谈到喀麦隆的形势时说，法国和美国帝国主义者再一次对我们所提出的和平和民主的解决喀麦隆问题的办法置之不顾。在这种情况下，我们的唯一的解决办法，就是斗争到底。为此，我们主张建立一个临时革命政府。
    苏联代表团团长米尔佐·图尔森—扎杰说，声势壮大的反殖民主义的摧枯拉朽的浪潮已经席卷亚洲和许多非洲国家。我们高兴地向已经恢复或者已经争取到自己的独立的亚非各国人民致敬。苏联人民十分明白，不完全恢复政治上的独立，长期遭受了殖民主义奴役的人民，是不可能确保自己的幸福的。然而，各国人民不仅必须争取自己的政治独立，而且必须争取自己的经济独立。必须加强我们这些国家之间的经济合作，并为在亚非国家和世界其它国家之间建立经济关系创造适当的条件。
    印度代表团团长拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人谴责帝国主义者在亚非国家施展的阴谋，例如修改美日“安全条约”，占领中国的领土台湾，在撒哈拉进行原子试验和最近南非大肆屠杀非洲人等等。她指出，这种种活动威胁亚非和世界的和平。她呼吁亚非各国人民加强它们之间的团结。
