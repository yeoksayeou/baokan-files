Comrades,

We fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan; fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Financial Statement and the draft of the 1960 National Budget; and fully agree with Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on achieving the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

Like the rest of the country, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, has adhered to the Party's General Line for socialist construction, adhered to the Great Leap Forward, and adhered to the great banner of the People's Communes, carrying out vigorous mass movements, enabling the national economy to achieve continuous leaps forward on the basis of the 1958 Great Leap Forward: the total value of industrial and agricultural production increased by 32% compared with 1958, of which the total value of industrial production increased by 55%, and the total value of agricultural and animal husbandry production increased by 15%. In the midst of two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, many new slogans and new forms of movement have emerged continuously in the mass movements in all aspects of socialist construction, and the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement in animal husbandry production is one of them. Now, we will focus on reporting to the conference on the progress of this movement.

The "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement requires one hundred suitable-aged female livestock to breed and have survive one hundred or more offspring within a year. At the same time, it requires a corresponding increase in the proportion of various improved livestock; it is necessary to greatly increase the number of livestock and rapidly improve the quality of livestock; it is necessary to develop small livestock at a high speed and develop large livestock at a high speed.

    The "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" Slogan Comes from the Broad Masses of Farmers and Herdsmen

The slogan "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" was initially put forward by the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen in Hangjin Banner, Ih Ju League. In the second half of 1959, the Hangjin Banner Committee of the Communist Party of China, in summarizing the animal husbandry production in 1959 (referring to the animal husbandry year, which is from July 1, 1958, to June 30, 1959), discovered 141 high-yielding ewe flocks with a survival rate of 115% for lambs, and eight groups of large livestock with a survival rate of 100% for offspring. They firmly grasped this advanced achievement, and in the process of opposing right-leaning tendencies and encouraging vigor, they deeply mobilized the masses for extensive discussion, affirmed this experience, and proposed to the entire region the initiative to launch the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement. The Inner Mongolia Party Committee promptly seized this new thing in the high-speed development of animal husbandry production, convened an on-site meeting for inspection and evaluation of animal husbandry production in the entire region, and seriously discussed this initiative. The comrades attending from various leagues and banners unanimously believed that compared with other places, Hangjin Banner, with conditions that were not superior and even very poor, dared to propose and be able to achieve "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring", and other regions should be fully capable of achieving it as well. Based on the discussions at the on-site meeting, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee issued a call to launch the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement throughout the region. The introduction of this call greatly encouraged the enthusiasm and vigor of the broad masses and cadres on the animal husbandry front, and enhanced their determination and confidence in the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. After the Party Committee issued the call, the slogan "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" immediately resounded throughout the vast rural and pastoral areas of the autonomous region, and immediately turned into the actual actions of the broad masses, quickly setting off a new upsurge in animal husbandry production.

    The "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" Movement Promotes the High-Speed Development of Animal Husbandry

Although the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement has not been carried out for long in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, it has already played a huge role in the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of 1959, in various parts of the autonomous region, there were more than 3,500 livestock groups with more than 380,000 large and small suitable-aged female livestock that had achieved "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring"; some had even achieved one hundred mothers and one hundred and twenty offspring, one hundred and fifty offspring; some advanced units had reached even higher levels, such as a flock of 220 ewes in the Chagan Naor Production Team of the Daode Temple Commune in Alukeerqin Banner, Zhaowuda League, which bred and raised 666 offspring in fourteen months, reaching three hundred and two offspring per hundred mothers. Due to the launch of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement, the reproduction rate of large livestock, which has always been low and considered by some to be impossible to improve much, has also greatly increased. For example, 104 cows in the Advanced Brigade of the Xiaojieji Commune in Kailu County, Jirem League, produced 107 calves in a year, and the horse herd grazed by Sandoubu of the Hongguang Brigade in the Changtuxili Commune of East Sonid Banner, Xilin Gol League, had 99 foals from 100 mares in a year. As of late March this year, the region had a total of more than 4.89 million lambs, an increase of more than 30% compared with the same period in 1959, with a survival rate of 93%, of which more than 180,000 large livestock were born, with a survival rate of 94%. This year, a large number of "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" high-yield groups have emerged in various places, with 4,812 livestock groups having achieved "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring". In Hangjin Banner, Ih Ju League, currently more than half of the livestock groups with suitable-aged female livestock have achieved "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring". The Bayinenger Commune of the banner has 14,308 large and small suitable-aged female livestock, breeding 14,553 offspring, with a breeding rate of nearly 102%. Currently, there are three communes, ninety-three management areas, and two hundred and thirteen small teams in the region that have achieved "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring".

The in-depth development of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement has promoted the further implementation of the eight measures for animal husbandry production and greatly improved the management level of animal husbandry production. With the development of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement, the construction of water conservancy, feed bases, grassland improvement, shed construction, disease prevention and control, and tool reform have also been greatly strengthened in the vast pastoral areas. Since the beginning of winter last year, although some areas of Inner Mongolia have suffered from disasters such as snow and drought, under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, and under the promotion of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement, the whole Party and the whole people have been mobilized to prevent disasters and fight drought in order to ensure the safe wintering and spring of livestock, and fought against disasters such as snow and drought, so that all livestock have basically safely survived the severe winter. For example, in some areas of Hulunbuir League, pastures were covered by heavy snow and suffered severe disasters, but due to the launch of the safe livestock group movement centered on "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring", the safety rate of livestock reached 99.4%. Xilin Gol League suffered from winter drought last year, but due to the promotion of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement, a large-scale winter drought prevention and well-drilling campaign was launched, which effectively overcame the winter drought. In Xiwuzhumuqin Banner alone, the league drilled 2,500 frozen wells, which is more than twice the total number of wells drilled in the past years. In the fight against disease prevention and control, the masses in Uxin Banner, Ih Ju League, self-made crude drugs such as sludge hormone, acid mildew hormone, and antibiotics, controlled liver fluke disease, and avoided a large number of livestock deaths. Otog Banner summarized more than 400 folk remedies for disease prevention and control of livestock. In the disaster prevention and drought resistance struggle from last winter to this spring, the three leagues of Hulunbuir League, Xilin Gol League, and Ih Ju League alone have seen more than 5,800 "safe livestock groups" without a single livestock death. All these achievements are rare in the past history.

The "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement concentrates and comprehensively embodies the central government's policy on the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. It can fully tap the infinite potential of animal husbandry production, so as to realize the large-scale and high-yield harvest of animal husbandry production. The launch of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement has advanced the process of high-speed development of animal husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to a new stage.

    "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" is a Clear, Vivid, Clearly Directed, and Conveniently Calculated Slogan

Why can the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement have such a huge mobilization and organization role? This is first of all because: at present, this is the most advanced and highest indicator in animal husbandry production. It prominently reflects the ardent desire of the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen, who have not only been liberated politically and economically but also ideologically, to develop animal husbandry production at a high speed with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. We all know that the speed of development of animal husbandry production is first reflected in the height of the survival rate of livestock breeding, so improving the survival rate of livestock breeding is the key to the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. The "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement firmly grasps the basic link of maximizing the survival rate of livestock breeding in the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. In order to achieve "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring", it is necessary to make every suitable-aged female livestock pregnant and produce; and make all offspring survive and be strong, which is precisely the greatest wish of the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen. At the same time, because the slogan "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" is very clear, vivid, and clearly directed, and conveniently calculated, although it only has four characters, it specifically expresses the basic things of animal husbandry production - maximizing the survival rate of breeding. Therefore, it is easily understood and accepted by the broad masses. Experience has proved that the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement can become and has begun to become a general program for the high-speed development of animal husbandry production. As long as we grasp this program, we can closely connect the eight measures for developing animal husbandry production like a chain and drive the entire animal husbandry production. Because to achieve "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring", it is necessary to comprehensively improve the level of management, and it is necessary to do a good job in a series of work such as breeding, pregnancy protection, lambing, conservation, grazing, disease prevention and control, sheds, forage feed, feeding management, and tool reform. If we do not strive to do every job well, no matter which link has a problem, it will affect the victory of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement. The "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement is based on livestock groups and carried out in banners, counties, and communes. It can not only give full play to the enthusiasm of the People's Communes and production teams, but also mobilize the enthusiasm of every breeding group and every grazing manager. In order to win the victory of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement, go all out and do our work well in all aspects. Therefore, it can quickly form a broad and in-depth mass movement.

The emergence of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement is not accidental. It is the product of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's vigorous development of animal husbandry production for more than ten years after liberation, laying a certain material foundation in the construction of pastoral areas, and accumulating a lot of experience in animal husbandry production. More importantly, it is the inevitable result of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's implementation of the policy of high-speed development of animal husbandry production under the guidance of the Party's General Line for socialist construction.

    The Total Livestock Breeding Rate Reached a Record High in 1959

After the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results was announced in 1958, whether Inner Mongolia's animal husbandry could leap forward and develop at a high speed became an urgent issue to be resolved at that time, and it was also the focus of our debate with all those with right-leaning conservative ideas in the field of animal husbandry. After a sharp struggle with these people, and breaking down one by one their right-leaning conservative arguments such as "the backwardness of animal husbandry", "the saturation of pastures", and "the development of animal husbandry has reached its peak", and winning the victory of this debate, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China firmly put forward the slogan of comprehensively, steadily, and rapidly developing animal husbandry, and on the basis of this victory, rapidly realized the cooperation of pastoral areas, and then realized the communization of the people, which greatly promoted the progress of various constructions in pastoral areas and the realization of settlement, and vigorously promoted the Great Leap Forward of animal husbandry production. In the Great Leap Forward, we also summarized the experience of developing animal husbandry production over the years and put forward eight measures for increasing animal husbandry production. As a result of implementing the policy of high-speed development and the eight measures, the total livestock increase rate in the region reached 22% and the net increase rate reached 9.3% in the 1958 animal husbandry year. In the 1959 animal husbandry year, on the basis of 1958, a greater leap forward victory was achieved. In this year, the total livestock increase rate reached 23.8% and the net increase rate reached 14.5%, becoming the highest record in the history of Inner Mongolia. The achievements of the leap forward in animal husbandry production in the past two years are unprecedented, but it still cannot meet the needs of the country and the people. The socialist construction of the country requires us to further increase the speed of development of animal husbandry. In the second half of 1959, after the rectification movement of anti-rightist tendencies, the socialist and communist consciousness of the people was further enhanced, and the revolutionary vigor was even higher. In particular, after the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's instructions on the mutual dependence of agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry, and the need to attach equal importance to planting and animal husbandry, and the need to attach great importance to the development of animal husbandry production were conveyed to the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen, the enthusiasm of the masses to accelerate the development of animal husbandry was further stimulated, which is the most direct reason and the greatest driving force for the emergence of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement.

The emergence of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement is also the result of the Party's in-depth leadership. Since the Autonomous Region Party Committee put forward the call for the high-speed development of animal husbandry, the Party and government leading organs at all levels have greatly strengthened the leadership of animal husbandry production. After the Central Committee issued instructions on cadres cultivating experimental fields, the cadres of various banners, counties, and communes set up many high-yield experimental livestock groups. The "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" was first discovered in the high-yield experimental livestock groups of cadres, and combined with the high-yield experience of the masses, concentrated, and then promoted to the masses.

From the above situation, it can be seen that the emergence and development of the "Hundred Mothers, Hundred Offspring" movement is the result of implementing the Party's General Line for socialist construction and realizing the communization of the people, the result of deeply carrying out the struggle between the two roads and the two lines among the broad masses of people, the result of adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, boldly mobilizing the masses, breaking superstition, giving full play to the subjective initiative of people, and strengthening the Party's leadership, constantly improving leadership methods, and adhering to the fundamental principle of "from the masses, to the masses". All of this, in short, is the result of doing things according to Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, in order to make this movement victorious and continuously push animal husbandry production to a higher level of development, in order to make the socialist construction cause continue to leap forward at a high speed, we must strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds. This is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve greater and greater victories in the future.

    内蒙古畜牧业生产的“百母百仔”运动
    “百母百仔”运动，就是要求一百头适龄母畜，在一年内繁殖并成活一百头和一百头以上的仔畜。同时要求相应地提高各种改良牲畜的比例；既要大大增加牲畜数量，又要迅速提高牲畜质量；既要高速度发展小牲畜，又要高速度发展大牲畜。奎　璧　王再天代表的发言各位代表：
    我们完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告；完全同意李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，完全同意谭震林副总理为提前实现全国农业发展纲要的报告。
    内蒙古自治区和全国各地一样，1959年在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，坚持党的社会主义建设总路线，坚持大跃进，坚持人民公社的伟大旗帜，开展了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，使国民经济在1958年大跃进的基础上实现了连续大跃进：工农牧业总产值比1958年增长32％，其中工业总产值增长55％；农牧业总产值增长15％。在两年连续大跃进中间，在社会主义建设各个方面的群众运动中，都陆续不断地出现了许多新的斗争口号和新的运动形式，畜牧业生产中的“百母百仔”运动就是其中的一种。现在，我们就着重地向大会汇报一下这个运动开展的情况。
      “百母百仔”运动，就是要求一百头适龄母畜，在一年内繁殖并成活一百头和一百头以上的仔畜。同时要求相应地提高各种改良牲畜的比例；既要大大增加牲畜数量，又要迅速提高牲畜质量；既要高速度发展小牲畜，又要高速度发展大牲畜。
      “百母百仔”口号来自广大农牧民群众
    “百母百仔”这个口号最初是由伊克昭盟杭锦旗的广大农牧民群众提出来的。1959年下半年中共杭锦旗委在总结1959年（这里说的是畜牧业年度，畜牧业年度的1959年就是从1958年7月1日到1959年6月30日）畜牧业生产的时候，发现了一百四十一个丰产母羊群繁殖成活仔畜115％，八群大牲畜繁殖成活仔畜100％的先进事迹，他们紧紧地抓住了这种先进的成就，在反右倾鼓干劲的过程中，深入发动群众广泛讨论，肯定了这项经验，并向全区提出了开展“百母百仔”运动的倡议。内蒙古党委及时抓住了这个高速度发展畜牧业生产的新事物，召开了全区畜牧业生产检查评比现场会议，认真地讨论了这项倡议。各盟旗到会的同志一致认为比起别的地方来说，条件并不优越甚至还很差的杭锦旗，都敢于提出而且能够实现“百母百仔”，别的地区也应该是完全能够实现的。根据现场会议的讨论，内蒙古党委发出了在全区开展“百母百仔”运动的号召。这一号召的提出，大大地鼓舞了畜牧业战线上的广大群众和干部的热情和干劲，增强了他们对于高速度发展畜牧业生产的决心和信心。党委的号召发出之后，“百母百仔”的口号，马上响遍了自治区的广大农村和牧区，并且马上变成了广大群众的实际行动，迅速地掀起了一个畜牧业生产的新高潮。
      “百母百仔”运动促进了畜牧业高速发展
    “百母百仔”运动在内蒙古自治区虽然开展不久，但它已经在高速度发展畜牧业生产上发挥了巨大的作用。据不完全统计，截至1959年年底，在自治区各地，有着三十八万多头大小适龄母畜的三千五百多个畜群，实现了“百母百仔”；有些还实现了百母一百二十仔、一百五十仔；部分先进单位达到了更高的水平，例如昭乌达盟阿鲁科尔沁旗道德庙公社查干淖尔生产队的一群二百二十只母山羊，十四个月内繁殖成活仔畜六百六十六只，达到了百母三百零二仔。由于开展了“百母百仔”运动，一向繁殖率较低，并且被某些人认为不可能有多大提高的大牲畜的增殖率，也大大提高了，像哲里木盟开鲁县小街基公社先进大队的一百零四头母牛，一年产犊一百零七头，锡林郭勒盟东苏尼特旗昌图锡里公社红光大队散都布放牧的马群，一百头母马一年产驹九十九头。截止今年3月下旬，全区共接羔四百八十九万多只，与1959年同期比较，接羔头数增加30％以上，成活率达到93％，其中大牲畜产仔十八万多头，成活率达到94％。今年各地出现了大批的“百母百仔”丰产群，已有四千八百一十二个畜群实现了“百母百仔”。伊克昭盟杭锦旗目前已有占一半以上适龄母畜的畜群实现了“百母百仔”。该旗巴音恩格尔公社，大小适龄母畜一万四千三百零八头，繁殖仔畜一万四千五百五十三头，繁殖率将近102％。现在全区已有三个公社，九十三个管理区，二百一十三个小队实现了“百母百仔”。
      “百母百仔”运动的深入开展，推动了畜牧业生产八项措施的进一步贯彻，大大地提高了畜牧业生产的经营管理水平。广大牧区随着“百母百仔”运动的开展，水利建设、饲料基地建设、草场改良、棚圈建设、疫病防治、工具改革等工作也大大地加强了。去年入冬以来，内蒙古部分地区虽然遭到了雪旱等灾害，但由于在各级党委和政府的领导下，在“百母百仔”运动的推动下，为了牲畜安全过冬过春，全党全民动员起来防灾抗旱，与雪旱等灾害进行了斗争，使全部牲畜基本上安全地渡过了严冬。如呼伦贝尔盟有些地区的草场被大雪复没，遭受了严重的灾害，但是，由于开展了以“百母百仔”为中心的安全畜群运动，因而使牲畜的安全率达到99.4％。锡林郭勒盟去年遭到了冬旱，但是由于在“百母百仔”运动的推动下，掀起了大规模的冬季防旱打井热潮，终于有效地战胜了冬旱。该盟仅西乌珠穆沁旗就打了冻井二千五百眼，相当于过去历年打井总数的两倍以上。在防治疫病的斗争中，伊克昭盟乌审旗群众自制了污泥素、酸霉素、抗生素等土药，控制了肝蛭病，避免了牲畜的大量死亡，鄂托克旗总结出了群众防治牲畜疫病的土法偏方四百多条。在去冬今春的防灾抗旱斗争中，仅仅呼伦贝尔盟、锡林郭勒盟、伊克昭盟三个盟，就出现了五千八百多个一头牲畜也没有死亡的“安全畜群”。所有这些成就，都是过去历史上少有的。
    “百母百仔”运动，集中地、全面地体现了中央关于高速度发展畜牧业生产的方针，它能够充分地挖掘畜牧业生产上的无穷潜力，从而实现畜牧业生产的大面积的高额丰收。“百母百仔”运动的开展，把内蒙古自治区高速度发展畜牧业的进程推进到了一个新的阶段。
      “百母百仔”是一个鲜明、生动、方向明确、计算方便的口号
    为什么“百母百仔”运动能够发生这么巨大的动员和组织作用呢？这首先是因为：在目前来说，这是畜牧业生产上的一个最先进、最高的指标，它突出地反映了不仅在政治、经济上获得了解放，而且在思想上也获得了解放的广大农牧民群众迫切要求多快好省地高速度发展畜牧业生产的热烈愿望。我们都知道，畜牧业生产发展速度的高低，首先表现在牲畜繁殖成活率的高低上，所以，提高牲畜的繁殖成活率，是高速度发展畜牧业生产的关键。“百母百仔”运动紧紧抓住了最大限度地提高牲畜繁殖成活率这个高速度发展畜牧业生产的基本环节。为要实现“百母百仔”，就必须使每一个适龄母畜都怀胎、生产；使所有仔畜都全活、全壮，而这恰恰就是广大农牧民群众最大的心愿。同时由于“百母百仔”这个口号非常鲜明、生动，并且方向明确，计算方便，它虽然只有四个字，但是把畜牧业生产的基本东西——最大限度地提高繁殖成活率，具体地表达了出来，所以它很容易为广大群众所理解和接受。经验证明，“百母百仔”运动可以成为并且已经开始成为高速度发展畜牧业生产的一条总纲，只要我们抓住这个纲，就可以把发展畜牧业生产的八项措施像链条一样紧密地连接在一起，把整个畜牧业生产带动起来。因为要实现“百母百仔”，就必须全面提高经营管理水平，就必须做好配种、保胎、接羔、保育、放牧、疫病防治、棚圈、饲草饲料、饲养管理、工具改革等一系列的工作。如果不努力做好这每一项工作，不论在哪一个环节上发生了问题，都会影响“百母百仔”运动的胜利。“百母百仔”运动是以畜群为基础，以旗、县和公社为单位开展起来的。它不仅可以充分发挥人民公社和生产队的积极性，而且能够把每一个饲养小组和每一个放牧管理人员的积极性都调动起来，为了夺取“百母百仔”运动的胜利，鼓足干劲，从各个方面来做好自己的工作。因此能够迅速的形成为广泛而深入的群众运动。
      “百母百仔”运动的出现，不是偶然的，它是解放后十多年来内蒙古自治区大力发展畜牧业生产，在牧区建设上，打下了一定的物质基础，在畜牧业生产上积累了许多经验的产物，而更重要的是内蒙古自治区在党的社会主义建设总路线的引导下，贯彻执行高速度发展畜牧业生产的方针的必然结果。
    一九五九年牲畜总增殖率达到最高纪录
    1958年党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线公布以后，内蒙古畜牧业能不能跃进，能不能高速度发展，成为当时迫切需要解决的课题，同时也是当时我们和畜牧业方面的一切有右倾保守思想的人争论的焦点。在经过和这些人的一场尖锐的斗争，并且逐一地击破了他们的什么“牧业落后论”，“牧场饱和论”，“畜牧业发展到顶论”等等右倾保守论点，取得了这一场争论的胜利之后，中共内蒙古自治区委员会坚定地提出了全面、稳定、高速度发展牧畜业的口号，并在这个斗争胜利的基础上，迅速实现了牧区合作化，接着又实现了人民公社化，大大地促进了牧区各项建设和实现定居的进程，有力地推动了畜牧业生产的大跃进。在大跃进中，我们又总结了历年来发展畜牧业生产的经验，提出了畜牧业增产的八项措施。贯彻执行高速度发展的方针和八项措施的结果，使1958年畜牧业年度全区畜牧总增率达到22％，纯增率达到9.3％，1959年畜牧业年度又在1958年的基础上，取得了更大跃进的胜利，这一年牲畜总增率达到23.8％，纯增率达到14.5％，成为内蒙古历史上的最高纪录。两年来畜牧业生产的跃进成就是史无前例的，但是它还远不能满足国家和人民的需要，国家社会主义建设事业要求我们更进一步提高畜牧业发展速度。1959年下半年，经过整风反右倾的整风运动，人民群众的社会主义和共产主义觉悟进一步提高了，革命干劲更加高涨了，特别是党中央和毛主席关于农、牧、林业互相依赖，必须把种植业和饲养业并重，必须极端重视发展畜牧业生产的指示传达到广大农牧民群众中去以后，更激发了群众加速发展畜牧业的热情，这就是“百母百仔”运动之所以能够出现的最直接的原因和最巨大的动力。
    “百母百仔”运动的出现，同时又是党的深入领导的结果。自从自治区党委提出高速度发展畜牧业的号召之后，各级党政领导机关都大大加强了对畜牧业生产的领导，在中央关于干部种试验田的指示发布以后，各旗县和公社的干部办起了许多的丰产试验畜群，“百母百仔”就是首先在干部丰产试验畜群中发现，并且结合群众的丰产经验，集中起来，又推广到群众中去的。
    从上面所说的情况，可以看出：“百母百仔”运动的出现和开展，是贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和实现人民公社化的结果，是在广大人民群众中深入开展两条道路和两条路线斗争的结果，是坚持政治挂帅，放手发动群众，破除迷信，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，和加强党的领导，不断改进领导方法，坚持“从群众中来到群众中去”的根本原则的结果，而所有这一切，归结为一点，就是按照毛主席思想办事的结果。因此，为了使这一运动胜利开展下去，把畜牧业生产不断推向更高的发展水平，为了使社会主义建设事业持续的高速度跃进，我们必须努力学习毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，这是我们在今后取得越来越大的胜利的根本保证。
