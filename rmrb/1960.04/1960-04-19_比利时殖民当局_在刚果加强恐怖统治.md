Xinhua News Agency, Stanleyville, April 17th: The Belgian colonial authorities in the Belgian Congo, under the pretext of "disturbances," announced on the 15th in Stanleyville that any public gatherings of more than ten people are prohibited from dusk until dawn the next morning.

    While issuing this indefinite ban, the colonial authorities also announced that police will step up their activities during the aforementioned time period and that local people are prohibited from carrying spears, knives, and similar objects. The people of Stanleyville are resolutely fighting for the immediate independence of the Congo and oppose the divisive activities of the colonial authorities. At the end of last October, the Belgian colonial authorities carried out a bloody suppression there of Africans demanding immediate independence.

    The Congo will hold provincial council and parliamentary elections in May and June, respectively, prior to independence. Recently, the Belgian colonial authorities have intensified their divisive activities and repressive measures in the Congo.

    比利时殖民当局
    在刚果加强恐怖统治
    据新华社17日讯　斯坦利维尔消息：比属刚果殖民当局15日借口“有骚动”在斯坦利维尔城宣布在每天黄昏以后，次晨以前禁止举行任何十人以上的公共集会。
    殖民当局在颁布这个无限期的禁令的同时还宣布，在上述规定时间内，警察将加强活动，并禁止当地人民携带长矛和小刀之类的东西。斯坦利维尔人民坚决为争取刚果立即独立而斗争，并且反对殖民当局的分裂活动。去年10月底，比利时殖民当局曾在那里对要求立即独立的非洲人进行血腥镇压。
    刚果将于5月和6月先后举行独立前的省议会和议会的选举。最近以来，比利时殖民当局加紧在刚果制造分裂活动和镇压措施。
