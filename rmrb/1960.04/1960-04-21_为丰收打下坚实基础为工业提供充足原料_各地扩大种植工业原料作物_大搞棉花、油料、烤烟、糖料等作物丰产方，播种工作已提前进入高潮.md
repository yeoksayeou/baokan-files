Xinhua News Agency, 20th - Various localities' sowing work for cotton, oilseed, hemp, flue-cured tobacco, and sugar crops has entered its peak ahead of schedule. From Guangdong to Heilongjiang, from the southeast coast to the northwest plateau, various industrial raw material crops are currently being sown intensively. Under the guidance of the principle of taking grain as the key link and ensuring all-round development, the broad masses of cadres and commune members in various localities are resolutely ensuring that they plant as many industrial raw material crops as possible and do a good job in sowing, laying a solid foundation for a bumper harvest of industrial raw material crops this year.

Cotton, which accounts for the largest sown area of all industrial raw material crops, according to information from agricultural departments: more than 42 million mu had been sown in the first few days of mid-April. The sowing progress is more than double that of the same period last year. Hubei Province has completed more than 85% of its sowing plan, Yunnan has completed more than 84%, Sichuan has completed 60%, and Jiangxi has completed 50%. Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces, which have the largest cotton planting area in the Yellow River basin, have all sown more than half. Hebei and Henan have each planted more than 8 million mu, and Shandong has planted more than 6 million mu. In addition, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shaanxi, Xinjiang and other provinces and regions have also sown more than 20% to 30% respectively. Currently, it is the suitable season for planting cotton, and various localities are rushing to sow at a very fast pace. Most of the major cotton-producing areas will basically complete the cotton sowing work by the end of April.

The sowing of spring oilseed crops has also begun on a large scale. As of April 15, nearly 8 million mu of spring peanuts had been sown in various localities, nearly 5 million mu of soybeans had been planted, more than 900,000 mu of spring sesame and spring rapeseed had been planted, and more than 5.5 million mu of small oilseed crops such as sunflowers and castor beans had been sown. Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian and other provinces and regions have basically completed the planting of spring peanuts. Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan and Shaanxi provinces and regions have sown 4 million mu of soybeans. Heilongjiang, Jilin, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Gansu, Shaanxi and other provinces and regions are planting large quantities of oilseed crops such as sunflowers, castor beans, and flax. Jilin Province alone has planted more than 1 million mu of sunflowers.

The sowing progress of hemp, flue-cured tobacco, and sugar crops is also faster than in the same period last year. 420,000 mu of jute and kenaf have been sown, 160,000 mu more than in the same period last year, more than 670,000 mu of cannabis have been sown, 390,000 mu more than in the same period last year, and 270,000 mu of ramie have been newly expanded. The sowing of flue-cured tobacco seedbeds is generally about 20 days earlier than in previous years. The nurturing of seedlings and transplanting of flue-cured tobacco in the southern regions of the Yangtze River was carried out in February and March. Currently, the seedling nurturing and transplanting work in the tobacco-producing areas north of the Yangtze River has entered a busy period. The sugarcane planting work in the southern provinces and regions has basically ended. Guangdong Province planted 2.27 million mu, exceeding the province's original plan. Guangxi fully completed its original plan. Sichuan, Fujian, Hunan, Guizhou and other provinces have all completed more than 90%. Sugar beet sowing has entered its peak period. The sowing work of sugar beet in various places south of the Yellow River will soon be completed, and various places north of the Yellow River are planting it on a large scale.

This year, many areas are sowing these crops while fighting drought. Since last winter, there has been less rain and snow, and varying degrees of drought have occurred in North China, Northwest China, Northeast China, and parts of the Yangtze River basin. Under the leadership of the Party, the masses in these areas have given full play to the superiority of the people's communes, organized manpower and material resources to fight drought in a timely manner, and ensured timely sowing.

Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, not only is the sowing progress of various industrial raw material crops faster this year, but also the sowing quality is better than in previous years. Due to the development of water conservancy construction, the irrigated area of cotton fields nationwide has reached 67% this year, an increase of 26% compared to last year. The application of base fertilizer has also increased more than last year, and due to the development of pig farming, the quality of fertilizer has improved. Moreover, 93% of the cultivated land for cotton planting was deeply ploughed last winter. The people's communes have also brought into play their superior conditions, universally adjusting the land for cotton planting. Scattered cotton fields have become concentrated large areas, which is greatly conducive to management, professional operation, the implementation of advanced technical measures, and the improvement of management technology. In cotton planting, various localities have taken various measures to ensure that all seedlings emerge at once, are complete, uniform, and strong. To this end, Shaanxi Province extensively promoted Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting experience, and trained a large number of cotton planting experts for various communes. Many new cotton areas have used the method of studying abroad or inviting teachers to train professional cotton planting teams. Currently, early-sown cotton fields in Yunnan have already emerged. Generally, they have achieved full, uniform, and strong seedlings. The sowing quality of other industrial raw material crops has also improved due to the further implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" of agriculture. For example, Guangxi sows 20,000 peanut seeds per mu, achieving rational close planting. Hemp fields in various localities have generally been deeply ploughed, and 5,000 to 10,000 catties of base fertilizer are applied per mu. This year, flue-cured tobacco production has promoted early tobacco, and the early tobacco planted in various localities can be greatly increased compared with last year, which can extend the growing period of tobacco leaves, increase yield, and also be conducive to leaving a second crop of tobacco. This year, various places in the south also promoted the yield-increasing experience of changing spring planting of sugarcane to winter planting. The national winter planting area of sugarcane reached more than 1.6 million mu, an expansion of more than 20 times compared with last year. Early winter planting of sugarcane can extend the growing period, increase the yield per mu and sugar content of sugarcane, and can also stagger the labor shortage during the busy spring plowing season, and can also be harvested earlier, supplying sugar factories to start squeezing and producing sugar in advance. Various localities have also vigorously promoted the excellent Taisugar 134 variety, so that more than half of the sugarcane fields nationwide are planted with this variety.

This year, people's communes in various localities are also carrying out large-scale bumper harvest squares and garden-style farming for industrial raw material crops; many areas have also established production bases for various industrial raw material crops. The area of cotton bumper harvest squares in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Hubei and other eight provinces accounts for more than 45% of the cotton sown area in these provinces. The area of peanut bumper harvest squares in Hebei Province accounts for 45% of the peanut sown area in the province, of which two-thirds of the area can guarantee harvest despite drought or flood. The area of bumper harvest squares or bumper harvest fields for hemp in various localities accounts for about 15% of the area of hemp fields nationwide. In Xuchang Prefecture, Henan, 620,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco have basically reached the standard of garden-style farming, accounting for 50% of the planting area, achieving irrigation and drainage, and double insurance with wells and canals. The area of sugarcane bumper harvest fields, bumper harvest dams and high-yield command fields in Sichuan Province accounts for 30% of the sugarcane area in the province. Jilin Province has adjusted more than 90% of the sugar beet area to be concentrated within 30 kilometers of the railway line in order to facilitate transportation, save labor, and reduce costs. Various localities have generally dispatched full-time cadres to lead the bumper harvest squares and bumper harvest fields, and established professional teams for careful management.

Under the overall arrangement with grain as the key link, the sown area of various industrial raw material crops will be expanded compared with last year. This fully demonstrates the superiority of the people's communes in comprehensively developing agricultural production. This year, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Sichuan and other provinces and regions have all expanded their planned cotton sown area compared with last year, and have developed some new cotton areas. For example, in Shulu County, Hebei, 76 production teams this year requested to plant more cotton. Siyang County, Jiangsu, is a newly developed cotton area. Last year, it planted 170,000 mu of cotton, and this year it will plant 300,000 mu. Guangdong and Guangxi in the south are also working hard to develop cotton planting. Qinghai and Fujian, which did not grow cotton in the past, also plan to plant cotton this year. In addition, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian and other provinces and regions have also tried planting long-staple cotton this year, of which Xinjiang has a larger trial planting scale. Regarding oilseed crops, the peanut sown area in Hebei, Henan and Shandong provinces will be expanded by several million mu compared with last year. Leibei County, Guangdong, has planted 240,000 mu of spring peanuts, 50,000 mu more than the original plan, and is now striving to plant more. Xiangcheng County, Henan, plans to intercrop sesame in all 200,000 mu of sweet potato fields in the county. Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi and Jiangxi provinces plan to expand the planting area of jute and kenaf, and Henan, Shandong and Guizhou provinces plan to expand the planting area of flue-cured tobacco compared with last year. The sugarcane planted in Guangdong has expanded by more than 70% compared with last year, and the sugarcane area in Guangxi and Fujian has expanded by about 30%. The sugar beet planting area in Inner Mongolia will be greatly expanded.

    为丰收打下坚实基础为工业提供充足原料
    各地扩大种植工业原料作物
    大搞棉花、油料、烤烟、糖料等作物丰产方，播种工作已提前进入高潮
    新华社20日讯　各地棉花、油料、麻类、烤烟和糖料等作物的播种工作已经提前进入高潮。从广东到黑龙江，从东南沿海到西北高原，目前都在加紧播种各种工业原料作物。在以粮为纲，全面发展的思想指导下，各地广大干部和公社社员都坚决保证尽可能地多种一些工业原料作物和过好播种关，为今年工业原料作物大丰收打下坚实的基础。
    占整个工业原料作物播种面积最大的棉花，据从农业部门了解：到4月中旬的前几天已经播种了四千二百多万亩。播种进度比去年同期加快了一倍多。湖北省已经完成播种计划85％多，云南已经完成84％多，四川已经完成60％，江西已经完成50％。黄河流域植棉面积最多的河北、河南、山东、山西等省都已播种了一半以上。河北、河南都已经种了八百多万亩，山东已经种了六百多万亩。此外，浙江、江苏、安徽、陕西、新疆等省区也已经分别播种了20％多到30％多。目前正是种棉的适宜节令，各地都在突击抢种，进度极快。主要产棉区到4月下旬多数可基本上完成棉花的播种工作。
    春种油料作物的播种工作也已经大规模开始。到4月15日止，各地春花生已经播种了将近八百万亩，大豆种了近五百万亩，春芝麻和春油菜种了九十多万亩，向日葵、蓖麻等小油料作物播种了五百五十多万亩。广东、广西、福建等省区的春花生已基本种完。广东、广西、福建、江西、湖南和陕西等省区播种大豆四百万亩。黑龙江、吉林、山西、内蒙古、青海、新疆、甘肃、陕西等省区大种向日葵、蓖麻、胡麻等油料作物。仅吉林一省就已种向日葵一百多万亩。
    麻类、烤烟和糖料作物的播种进度也比去年同期快。黄麻、洋麻已播四十二万亩，比去年同期多播十六万亩，大麻已播六十七万多亩，比去年同期多播三十九万亩，苎麻已新扩种二十七万亩。烤烟苗床播种普遍比往年提早二十天左右。长江以南地区的烤烟在2、3月间进行了育苗和移栽，目前长江以北各产烟区育苗移栽工作进入大忙。南方各省区的甘蔗栽插工作已基本结束。广东省栽了二百二十七万亩，超额完成了省原订的计划，广西全部完成了原订的计划，四川、福建、湖南、贵州等省都已完成了90％以上。甜菜播种进入了盛期，黄河以南各地甜菜的播种工作很快就可完成，黄河以北各地正在大种。
    今年不少地区是抗旱播种这些作物的。从去冬以来，雨雪较少，华北、西北、东北和长江流域部分地区发生了不同程度的旱象。这些地区的群众在党的领导下，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，组织人力、物力及时地进行抗旱，保证了适时下种。
    在各级党委的领导下，今年各种工业原料作物不仅播种进度快，而且播种的质量也比往年好。由于水利建设的发展，今年全国棉田的灌溉面积已达67％，比去年增加了26％。施基肥也比去年增加较多，而且由于养猪事业的发展，肥料质量有了提高。而且93％的种棉耕地去冬都进行了深耕。人民公社又发挥优越条件，普遍调整好地种棉，分散的棉田变成了集中的大片，大大有利于管理，有利于专业经营，有利于先进技术措施的贯彻和管理技术的提高。在种棉中，各地都采取了种种措施，来保证一次苗全、苗齐、苗壮。陕西省为此大规模地推广了张秋香的种棉经验，为各地公社训练了大批植棉能手。许多新棉区都用留学或请老师的办法，训练了种棉的专业队伍。现在云南早种棉田已经出苗。一般都达到苗全、苗齐、苗匀和苗壮。其他工业原料作物的播种质量，由于进一步贯彻“八字宪法”也有提高。如广西播种的花生每亩下种达两万粒，做到了合理密植。各地麻田一般都进行了深耕，每亩施底肥五千到一万斤。今年烤烟生产推广了早烟，各地种植的早烟可比去年大大增加，这样可延长烟叶的生长期，提高产量，而且又有利于留二茬烟。今年南方各地还推广了春栽甘蔗改为冬栽的增产经验，全国冬栽的甘蔗面积达一百六十多万亩，比去年扩大二十多倍。甘蔗提早冬栽可延长生长期，提高甘蔗的亩产量和含糖量，又可错开春耕大忙时的劳力紧张，还可提早收获，供应糖厂提前开榨生产食糖。各地还大力推广优良的台糖一三四品种，使全国有一半以上的甘蔗田种植这种品种。
    今年，各地人民公社种植工业原料作物也大搞丰产方，大搞园田化；不少地区还建立了各种工业原料作物的生产基地。河北、山东、河南、陕西、江苏、湖北等八省棉花丰产方的面积，都占这些省棉花播种面积的45％以上。河北省花生丰产方的面积占全省花生播种面积的45％，其中有三分之二的面积达到旱涝保收。各地麻类田的丰产方或丰产田的面积已占全国麻田的面积的15％左右。河南许昌专区全区已有六十二万亩烤烟基本达到了园田化的标准，占种植面积的50％。做到能灌溉能排渍，井渠双保险。四川省甘蔗丰产田、丰产坝和高产指挥田的面积占全省甘蔗面积的30％。吉林省把90％以上的甜菜面积，都调整到离铁路沿线三十公里以内的地区集中种植，以便运输，节省劳力，降低成本。各地对丰产方、丰产田，一般都派了专职干部去领导，并成立专业队精心经营。
    人民公社在以粮为纲、全面安排下，今年各种工业原料作物的播种面积都将比去年扩大。这充分显示了人民公社对全面发展农业生产的优越性。今年，河北、河南、山东、山西、甘肃、新疆、江苏、安徽、湖北、四川等省区，棉花计划播种面积都比去年有所扩大，都发展了一些新棉区。如河北束鹿县今年就有七十六个生产队要求多种棉花。江苏泗阳县是一个新发展起来的棉区，去年种棉十七万亩，今年就要种三十万亩。南方广东、广西也在努力发展种棉，过去不种棉的青海和福建今年也计划种植棉花。此外，新疆、云南、广东、广西、福建等省区今年还都试种了长绒棉，其中新疆的试种规模较大。关于油料作物，今年河北、河南、山东三省的花生播种面积将比去年扩大几百万亩。广东雷北县春花生已种二十四万亩，比原计划多种了五万亩，现还要争取多种一些。河南襄城县计划把全县二十万亩甘薯田全部间种芝麻。江苏、安徽、广东、广西和江西等省区计划种植的黄麻、洋麻和河南、山东、贵州三省烤烟种植面积，都计划比去年扩大。广东栽植的甘蔗比去年扩大70％以上，广西、福建甘蔗面积扩大30％左右。内蒙古的甜菜种植面积将扩大很多。
