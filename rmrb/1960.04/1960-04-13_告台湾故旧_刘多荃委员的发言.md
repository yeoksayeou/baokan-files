To my old friends in Taiwan,

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse the reports of the two Vice Premiers and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong.

After listening to the reports of the two Vice Premiers, and then verifying them with the facts I have seen in Liaoning over the past few years and during my recent visit to Hubei, I feel that the achievements of the motherland's construction in all aspects are progressing at an incredible speed, and are still constantly leaping forward. I am incredibly excited! Therefore, I think of my old friends in Taiwan, do they know about the glorious achievements of the motherland? They probably know a little, but under the control of American imperialism, they cannot avoid being deceived, and therefore they cannot be without concerns. In order to dispel their concerns and reveal the truth, I would like to talk about what I have heard and seen.

I think my old friends in Taiwan may have many misunderstandings about the People's Communes. Are the People's Communes good? I say they are not just good, but very good. Take the several People's Communes in Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, which I personally saw, for example. The area used to be barren and stagnant, but last year, although it suffered from the worst drought in 72 years, thanks to the large number of people in the People's Communes, their unified will, and their great strength, they built water conservancy projects on a large scale and fought the drought with all their might, and still achieved a great harvest. Not only in agriculture, but they also actively managed commune-run industries, such as agricultural machinery factories, cotton ginning factories, etc., which not only solved their own needs, but also increased the income of the commune members, and laid the foundation for agricultural mechanization. Can this be said to be bad? As production increased, income also increased. For example, the net income of each commune member, which used to be only a few yuan, can reach more than 800 yuan this year, so the people's living standards have naturally greatly improved. A series of collective welfare undertakings such as kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and public canteens have been established. The Taiping Commune also used the 81 days of agricultural slack time from last winter to this spring to build a new rural area of several thousand households with neat streets and lush trees. The living conditions are close to the level of the city. You can buy everything in a department store there that you can buy in Wuhan, and other things can be imagined. What is presented to us is a picture of joyful and happy life! This is not like the special life of a very small number of landlords and wealthy merchants in the old society, but the ordinary life of ordinary people, which is absolutely impossible under the private ownership system of thousands of years. Zaoyang is like this, and all parts of the country are similar. The countryside is like this, and the urban people's communes are also developing vigorously. The commune-run factories in the urban people's communes, which I saw in Hubei, are really like bamboo shoots after a rain, and there are all kinds of collective welfare undertakings. This not only completely eliminates the phenomenon of unemployment left over from the old society, but also exerts people's potential strength, not only gradually changing the consumer cities into production cities, but also fundamentally changing the relationship between people. Free from oppression, exploitation, free from hunger and cold, with enough food and clothing, and a happy mood, is there any more free life than this? Because the People's Communes have such unparalleled superiority and infinite vitality, the broad masses of people regard the People's Communes as a magic weapon and a lifeline, and firmly say "thunder cannot scatter them."

Secondly, I think my old friends in Taiwan are not very clear about our new families. Is the feudal remnant of the old family good, or is our current new family good? I say that the new family is not just a little better than the old family, but essentially different. In the old family, the head of the family had exclusive power, women were oppressed, the rich were extravagant and licentious, and the poor were separated from their wives and children, which was also a hell on earth. Now women are liberated from housework and participate in productive labor, which is exactly their urgent demand. Husband and wife work together and respect each other on an equal basis. Children go to kindergartens and are better educated. Whether after work or during holidays, the family gathers together and lives more happily. At the same time, due to women's participation in productive labor, family income has generally increased. I am now the Director of the Department of Transportation in Liaoning Province. As far as I know, after the general housewives in Shenyang City participated in productive labor, the income of each family increased by an average of 20% to 35%. Some residents who needed government relief in the past have now become savings households. I visited several housewives in Wuhan City, and they all said in unison: "Seeing the rapid progress of the motherland's construction, everyone enthusiastically participates and contributes all their strength. We no longer want to be idle at home." I also visited a family service station in Wuhan City. It can take care of and do all the cooking, washing, sewing, repairing, cleaning, and purchasing, and it does it very well. The masses call it a "universal service station" and a "street general affairs section." In this way, people's production and life are collectivized, they love and help each other, and their relationship is more intimate. It is really like flesh and blood, as close as a family. The whole society is like a warm big family. Only those who deliberately distort and are deceived will be hostile to this situation. I think my old friends in Taiwan will not object to it when they understand the truth.

Again, my old friends in Taiwan may not understand the great significance of our productive labor. Taking students' participation in productive labor as an example, they understand things they don't understand in books, solve problems that cannot be solved in classrooms, and of course, their physical strength is better exercised, and their habits of mutual assistance and cooperation are better cultivated. Taking cadres' participation in productive labor as an example, they understand things they don't understand, solve long-standing problems, and the relationship between cadres and the masses is also closer. As for labor creating social wealth, the achievements in industrial, agricultural, cultural and educational construction in the past ten years are all facts. The speed of basic construction of large enterprises like the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, which I saw, is already amazing! Even small and medium-sized factories, like the Light Industry Machinery Factory in Wuhan City, were just 14 handicraft workers carrying copper loads in 1950, who could only repair locks and keys. Now it has developed to more than 1,000 workers, hundreds of machine tools, and can manufacture complete sets of machine tools, motors, and complete sets of paper-making and textile machinery equipment. The capital has increased from several hundred yuan at the beginning to an annual output value of more than 10 million yuan. The average income of workers is now more than four times higher than in 1950. What does this mean? This shows that in the new society, hard work without exploitation means that any career has a promising future. Because the broad masses of people urgently hope to fundamentally get rid of the "poverty and blankness" and realize a strong socialist country as soon as possible, they consciously and enthusiastically work, which cannot be forced by any force. On the contrary, like the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the workers work day and night, and are unwilling to go home for the Spring Festival. No one can persuade them even if they want to. Labor has become a part of life for the enlightened people, and of course it is difficult for those who love ease and hate work to understand.

Finally, it seems that my old friends in Taiwan cannot help but be surprised when they hear the word "transformation." In fact, in my opinion, transformation is just to fundamentally change the bad thoughts, work styles, and living habits, that is, "to turn from evil to good." In the old society, selfishness, harming others to benefit oneself, corruption, and fighting for power and profit, etc., have become commonplace. Shouldn't they be corrected now? What's wrong with changing them? If they are not changed, it is a society where people eat people, which my old friends in Taiwan have personally experienced. If they are changed, it is a new society where everyone is for me and I am for everyone. I think this should be what my old friends in Taiwan hope for. As long as everything is not for personal gain and is based on impartiality, such thoughts are not afraid of being seen by people at any time, and are free at any time. Otherwise, the freedom of a very small number of privileged classes to exploit and oppress people in the old society is a sin, and it is not the freedom needed by the new society.

The happier we live in the motherland, the more we, who have relatives and friends in Taiwan, care about our relatives and friends in Taiwan. I don't need to expose how poor and dark Taiwanese society is here, because those who stay in Taiwan know this better than we do. I just want to ask: Fellow Northeasterners and my old friends who fled to the isolated island of Taiwan, it has been ten years, and your lives are getting worse and worse. Will you always live under someone else's roof and eventually die in a foreign land? The fellow Northeasterners have a good tradition of resisting Japan and saving the country, and I think they are unwilling to be enslaved by American imperialism in their hearts. The motherland is becoming increasingly prosperous, while American imperialism and its followers are declining. It should be time to make a quick decision on where to go. Premier Zhou Enlai has repeatedly stated that patriotism does not distinguish between early and late. As long as the Kuomintang military and government personnel remaining in Taiwan can abandon the darkness and turn to the light and return to the mainland, they will have a bright future. The preferential treatment we, thousands upon thousands of former Kuomintang military and government personnel, have received on the mainland is the future of everyone who returns from Taiwan at any time.

### 告台湾故旧  刘多荃委员的发言

专栏：

    告台湾故旧
    刘多荃委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护两位副总理和陈叔通副主席的报告。
    我听了两位副总理的报告，再拿我几年来在辽宁所看到的和最近去湖北所参观到的事实印证一下，觉得祖国各方面的建设成就，真是一日千里，而且目前还在不断地跃进中，我兴奋的了不得！因此，我连想到，现在台湾的旧日友好们，他们对于祖国的辉煌成就知道不知道呢？知道可能是知道一点的，但是在美帝控制之下，他们不会不受蒙蔽，因而他们也就不可能毫无顾虑。为了解除他们的顾虑，揭明事实的真相，我愿意就我所耳闻目见的谈一谈。
    我想现在台湾的旧日友好们可能对于人民公社误解很多。究竟人民公社好不好呢？我说不只好，而且好得很。以我的亲眼看到的湖北枣阳县的几个人民公社来说，那里原是死土料僵的地方，可是去年虽然遭到了七十二年来未有的旱灾，由于人民公社的人多心齐力量大，大兴水利，全力抗旱，仍然获得很大的丰收。不只是农业，他们积极经营社办工业，如农业机械厂、轧花厂等等，既解决了本身的需要，又增加了社员的收入，还为农业机械化打下了基础。这能说是不好吗？生产增加了，紧跟着收入也增加了。例如，每个社员的净收入，过去只有几元的，今年就可达到八百多元，那么，人们的生活水平自然也就大大提高了。幼儿园、敬老院、公共食堂一系列的集体福利事业都已兴办起来。太平公社还利用了去冬今春八十一天的农闲时间，建起了一个街道整齐、绿树成荫的几千户的新农村，居住条件接近城市的水平，从那里一个百货公司里可以买到在武汉所能买到的一切东西，其它可以想见。摆在我们面前的，完全是一幅欢乐幸福生活的图景！这不是像旧社会极少数地主富商的特殊生活，而是一般人民的普通生活，在几千年来的私有制度下是绝对做不到的。枣阳是这样，全国各地，大同小异。农村是这样，城市人民公社也在蓬勃发展。城市人民公社的社办工厂，我在湖北看到的真如雨后春笋一般，集体福利事业应有尽有。这就不但彻底消灭了旧社会遗留下来的失业现象，而且发挥了人们的潜在力量，不但把消费城市逐渐改变为生产城市，而且人和人的关系也连带着起了根本的变化。摆脱了压迫，剥削，摆脱了饥寒交迫，丰衣足食，心情舒畅，还有比这更自由的生活吗？由于人民公社有这样无比的优越性和无限的生命力，所以广大人民才把人民公社当做法宝，当做命根子，坚决地说“雷打不散”。
    其次，我想，现在台湾的旧日友好们，对于我们的新家庭不很清楚。封建残余的旧家庭好呢，还是我们现在的新家庭好？我说新家庭比旧家庭好的不是一点半点，而是本质不同。旧家庭家长专权，妇女受压迫，有钱的骄奢淫逸，无钱的妻离子散，同样是人间地狱。现在妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加了生产劳动，正是她们的迫切要求，而且夫妇在平等的基础上，共同劳动，互相尊重，小孩到幼儿园，教育得更好，无论在工作完毕或假期，一家团聚，生活得更加快乐。同时，由于妇女参加生产劳动，家庭收入普遍增加。我现在辽宁省担任交通厅长，据我所知，沈阳市的一般家庭妇女参加了生产劳动以后，每家收入平均增加20％至35％，一些过去需要政府救济的居民，现在都变成了储蓄户。我在武汉市访问过几个家庭妇女，她们众口一声地对我说：“看到祖国建设的突飞猛进，大家热烈参加，贡献自己的全副力量，我们再也不愿闲在家里了”。我在武汉市还参观了一个家庭服务站，所有烧饭、洗衣、缝纫、修补、打扫、购买，它都可代管代做，而且做的很出色，群众叫它“万能服务站”，“街道总务科”。这样一来，人们的生产和生活都集体化了，彼此友爱互助，关系倍加亲切，真是情同骨肉，亲如一家，整个社会俨然是充满温暖的大家庭。只有故意歪曲和受人欺骗的人才会对这种情况加以敌视。我想现在台湾的旧日友好们明白真相了也不会反对吧。
    再次，现在台湾的旧日友好们还可能不了解我们生产劳动的伟大意义。以学生参加生产劳动来说，在书本上不懂的东西懂了，在课室里不能解决的问题解决了，当然体力锻炼得更壮，互助合作的习惯培养得更好。以干部参加生产劳动来说，不了解的事物了解了，久悬不决的问题解决了，干部和群众的关系也更加亲密。至于劳动创造社会财富，十年来工业、农业、文化教育各方面的建设成就，事实具在。像我看到的大型企业武钢，基本建设的速度，已经惊人！就是中小型工厂，像武汉市的轻工业机械厂，在1950年不过是十四个挑铜匠担子的手工业工人，只能修配锁头钥匙，现在已经发展到一千多名工人，几百台机床，能制造成套机床、马达和成套的造纸纺织机械设备，资金从开办时的几百元，达到年产值一千多万元，工人平均收入现在也比1950年增加了四倍多。这说明什么问题呢？这说明在新社会中辛勤劳动、不受剥削，任何事业都有发展的前途。广大人民由于迫切希望根本摆脱“一穷二白”的局面，早日实现强大的社会主义国家，因而自觉地、热情地劳动，这不是任何力量所能强迫他们的。反之，像眼前的技术革新技术革命运动，工人同志们废寝忘餐，春节都不肯回家，任何人想劝阻他们也是劝阻不了的。劳动，对于觉悟了的人民已是生活的一部分，对于好逸恶劳的人来说，当然很难理解。
    最后，仿佛现在台湾的旧日友好们听到“改造”两个字就不免大惊小怪。其实，依我看来，改造不过是把不好的思想作风生活习惯根本改过来，就是“改邪归正”。在旧社会，自私自利，损人利己，贪污腐化，争权夺利，等等，已经相习成风，难道现在还不应该改正吗？改了又有什么不好？不改是人吃人的社会，现在台湾的旧日友好们都曾亲自经历过；改了就是人人为我，我为人人的新社会，我想这应该是现在台湾的旧日友好们所希望的。只要事事不是为个人打算，一秉大公，这样的思想什么时候也不怕见人，什么时候都是自由的，不然，像旧社会极少数特权阶级剥削人、压迫人的自由，那是罪恶，那不是新社会需要的自由。
    我们在祖国大陆上越过越快乐，就使我们这些在台湾有亲友的人，越来越关怀在台湾的亲友。我在这里不必揭露台湾社会是如何贫穷黑暗，因为这一切留在台湾的人比我们清楚。我只是想问一问：逃亡到台湾孤岛的东北同乡们和我的旧朋友们，十年了，你们的日子越来越不好过，难道永远这样寄人篱下，最后死于异乡吗？东北的同乡有抗日救国的优良传统，想来在内心上是不愿受美帝国主义奴役的。祖国日益强盛，而美帝国主义及其仆从日薄西山，何去何从，应该是迅速抉择的时候了。周恩来总理一再表明：爱国不分先后，只要留在台湾的国民党军政人员能够弃暗投明，回到大陆定有光明的前途的。我们成千上万的原国民党军政人员在大陆上所受到的优遇，就是随时从台湾归来的一切人的前途。
