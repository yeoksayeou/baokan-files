Advanced Teams Exceed the Outline, Backward Teams Catch Up with the Outline
Jieshou County, Anhui Province, Proposes Five Measures to Launch a Grain Production Increase Competition

    (Our report) Jieshou County, Anhui Province, in this year's spring production, is focusing on some communes and teams that did not reach the target outlined for grain production last year, helping them to quickly achieve or exceed the agricultural development outline's prescribed targets.

    Last year, the average grain yield per mu in Jieshou County reached 555 jin, ahead of schedule in achieving the targets stipulated in the Agricultural Development Outline. However, the development among production teams was very uneven. Among the 5 communes and 97 brigades in the county, 8 brigades did not reach the target outlined, including 3 brigades with a yield of 200 to 300 jin per mu, and 5 brigades with 300 to 400 jin per mu. Currently, some cadres and masses in the communes and teams that have already reached the grain targets stipulated in the outline believe that the grain problem has been solved, advocating reducing the area of ​​grain crops and planting more cash crops with high value and income. A small number of communes and teams that have not reached the grain targets underestimate their own strength. The county party committee believes that these ideas are obstacles to catching up with and exceeding the outline. In order to smoothly eliminate these ideological obstacles, the county party committee organized an inspection team to conduct in-depth investigations and research. The investigation shows that the advanced teams have strong leadership, good water conservancy conditions, abundant funds, and successful experience in increasing production. As long as they carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution and conscientiously implement the agricultural production policy of "taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward," they can continue to leap forward. Although the backward teams have a poor foundation, according to the actual situation of these teams, most of them have favorable conditions such as more land and abundant water resources. At the same time, under the encouragement of the general line and the Great Leap Forward, the vast number of commune members have a strong desire to quickly change their situation. As long as they rely on their own efforts to fully tap their potential, they can achieve and exceed the targets stipulated in the outline in the annual grain production.

    In order to enable the backward teams to reach and exceed the targets stipulated in the outline in grain production this year, the county party committee, based on the specific conditions of the backward teams, adopted the following measures:

    First, vigorously carry out farmland capital construction. Since last winter, the county party committee has transferred cadres to specifically help the eight backward teams formulate water conservancy plans, mobilizing these teams to rely on their own efforts to excavate rivers and dig wells to ensure the needs of this spring and summer harvest crops and paddy fields.

    Second, massively convert to high-yield crops. This year, the eight backward brigades have sown more than 82,000 mu of high-yield crops, accounting for more than 90% of the total cultivated area. The conversion of dry land to paddy fields alone has increased by two and a half times compared with last year.

    Third, strengthen the leadership of the Party. The county has successively transferred 27 county- and district-level cadres to serve in various leadership positions in backward communes and teams.

    Fourth, vigorously carry out tool reform. In the movement to catch up with and exceed the outline, backward teams must complete greater production tasks than advanced teams. Therefore, the shortage of labor is the main contradiction in the current production of backward teams. The county party committee systematically sent blacksmiths, carpenters and cadres to help backward areas vigorously carry out tool reform for water management, water lifting, cultivation, transportation, pig raising, cooking utensils, etc., so that these teams successively created and reformed more than 15,000 pieces of various agricultural tools, and the efficiency of work has generally increased several times to dozens of times, effectively solving the difficulty of insufficient labor.

    Fifth, mobilize relevant departments to fully support the production of backward teams. Industrial and commercial departments give priority to supplying backward teams with irrigation and drainage machinery, fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and livestock.

    For the eighty-nine advanced brigades that have already reached the outline in grain production, the county party committee helped them summarize their experience in increasing production, formulated a plan for establishing agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery commodity bases, and required them to continue to expand the multiple cropping index and planting area, convert to high-yield crops on a larger scale, achieve intensive cultivation and fine management, and require an average of 1,500 jin per person in grain production, while developing a variety of economies in an all-round way.

    Now, the entire county has formed a competition upsurge in which every commune and every team is catching up with and exceeding the outline. Outstanding achievements have been made on all fronts. To date, 210,000 mu of spring land in the county has been plowed and harrowed two to three times, and more than 300 dan of fertilizer has been applied per mu. The paddy fields, which have been expanded by one and a half times compared with last year, are filled with spring water; the area of ​​spring sweet potatoes has doubled compared with last year. Most of the 500,000 mu of wheat in the county, because they were planted early and managed carefully, have begun to joint and sprout.

    先进队超纲要　后进队赶纲要
    安徽界首县提出五项措施开展粮食增产竞赛
    本报讯　安徽界首县在今年春季生产中，狠抓去年在粮食生产上还没有达到纲要指标的一些社、队，帮助他们迅速实现或超额实现农业发展纲要规定的指标。
    界首县去年粮食平均亩产达到五百五十五斤，提前实现了农业发展纲要规定的指标，但是生产队之间发展很不平衡。全县五个公社，九十七个大队中，没有达到纲要指标的有八个大队，其中亩产二百至三百斤的有三个大队，三百至四百斤的有五个大队。目前，已经达到纲要中规定粮食指标的社、队，部分干部和群众认为粮食问题解决了，主张减少粮食作物面积，多种些价值高收入大的经济作物；少数没有达到粮食指标的社、队，又对自己的力量估计不足。县委认为这些思想都是赶纲要超纲要的障碍。为顺利扫除这些思想障碍，县委组织了检查组，深入进行了调查研究。调查表明，先进队领导力量强，水利条件好，资金雄厚，副业生产搞得好，同时又有较成熟的增产经验，只要发扬不断革命精神，认真贯彻“以粮为纲，全面跃进”的农业生产方针，就可以继续跃进。后进队虽然基础差，底子薄，但根据这些队实际情况来看，大多数都具有土地多、水利资源充足等有利条件，同时广大社员在总路线、大跃进的鼓舞下，有着迅速改变面貌的强烈愿望，只要依靠自己的努力充分挖掘潜力，就能在全年的粮食生产上实现和超额实现纲要规定的指标。
    为了使后进队今年在粮食生产上达到和超过纲要规定的指标，县委根据后进队具体情况，采取以下几项措施：
    第一，大搞农田基本建设。自去冬以来，县委抽调干部具体帮助八个后进队制定了水利规划，发动这些队自力更生，开挖河道、打井，保证了今春夏收作物和稻田用水的需要。
    第二，大规模地改种高产作物。今年八个后进大队共播种高产作物八万二千多亩，占耕地总面积的90％以上，其中仅旱地改种水稻一项，就比去年增加二倍半。
    第三，加强党的领导。全县先后抽调县、区级干部二十七人，到后进社、队担任各种领导工作。
    第四，大搞工具改革。后进队在赶纲要、超纲要运动中，要完成比先进队更大的生产任务。因此，劳动力不足是当前后进队生产上的主要矛盾。县委有计划地派出铁木工人和干部，帮助后进地区大搞治水、提水、耕作、运输、养猪、炊具等工具改革，使这些队先后创制和改制各种农具一万五千多件，工效普遍提高几倍到几十倍，有力地解决了劳力不足的困难。
    第五，发动有关部门全力支援后进队生产。工商部门优先供应后进队排灌机械、化肥、农药、种子和牲畜。
    对于在粮食生产上已经达到纲要的八十九个先进大队，县委帮助他们总结了增产经验，制定了建立农、林、牧、副、渔商品基地的规划，要求他们继续扩大复种指数和播种面积，更大规模地改种高产作物，做到精耕细作，在粮食生产上要求平均每人达到一千五百斤的同时，全面发展多种经济。
    现在，全县形成了一个社社队队赶纲要、超纲要的竞赛热潮。各条战线上都做出了突出的成绩。到目前止，全县二十一万亩春地已普遍耕耙二至三遍，每亩施肥三百担以上。比去年扩大一倍半的水稻田，灌满了春水；春红芋面积比去年扩大了一倍。全县五十万亩小麦，因为种得早，管得细，大部分已开始拔节孕穗。
