Xinhua News Agency report: This spring's afforestation movement started early, came on strong, moved quickly, was large in scale, and had high-quality afforestation, greatly exceeding any previous year. From last winter to this spring, the southern provinces and regions closely combined the afforestation movement with mountain management, water management, and soil management; the northern provinces and regions broke the convention of "afforestation only after the Spring Festival," and since New Year's Day, many areas have been afforesting despite wind and snow. Currently, Guizhou, Fujian, Shaanxi, Guangxi, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Liaoning, and Hebei thirteen provinces and regions, have all successively completed their annual afforestation plans ahead of schedule and exceeded their quotas.

In the nationwide tree planting and afforestation movement, the broad masses of young people are a shock force. They actively respond to the call of the Party and are full of energy. In Shandong Province, 16 million young people have afforested 4.36 million mu together with adults, planted 530 million trees around houses and villages, cultivated 184,000 mu of seedlings, and built more than 2,700 youth forests. In Hunan Province, the broad masses of young people have established 3,545 forestry bases, covering an area of more than 8 million mu; in Shanxi Province, young people in 16 counties, including Pinglu, have established more than 600 bases for various timber forests and economic forests, covering an area of more than 190,000 mu.

This year, when commemorating the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, women across the country greeted their holiday with practical actions of planting trees and afforestation. Many provinces and regions, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Henan, and Hebei, have also organized professional teams of women engaged in forestry production and established a large number of women's forest farms and professional teams run by the communes.

In this spring's afforestation movement, all localities have conscientiously implemented the forestry "Three-izations" (base-ization, forest farm-ization, high-yield-ization) policy. Many areas have carried out planning before afforestation. Provinces and regions lacking timber, such as Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, and Anhui, have been building their own timber forest bases in the spring afforestation movement. Jiangsu Province has already created 660,000 mu of mine pillar timber forests near the Xuzhou-Huaiyin mining area. Provinces and regions such as Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Zhejiang are vigorously building economic forest bases, mainly for oil-tea trees, and timber forest bases, mainly for Chinese fir forests. While vigorously carrying out the construction of forestry bases, the commune-run forest farms have achieved rapid development. Now, the number of forest farms run by communes and teams across the country has increased from more than 20,000 last winter to more than 77,000.

All localities have combined the spring afforestation movement with a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, improved labor productivity, and accelerated the progress of afforestation. Longjiang Forest Farm in Heilongjiang Province has proposed a method of relying on the masses, self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, modification, imitation, and multi-purpose use of one object, and has already manufactured tree planting machines and shovel harrowing machines. In Dazhuang Forest Farm in Pucheng County, Fujian, many forestry tools have reached a semi-mechanized level.

    全国春季造林成绩巨大
    十三个省、区一年造林计划一季完成
    据新华社讯  今春造林运动动手之早、来势之猛、速度之快、规模之大、造林质量之高，就大大超过以往任何一年。南方各省、区从去冬到今春，紧密结合治山、治水、治土工作开展造林运动；北方各省、区打破了“春节后才造林”的常规，从元旦以来，许多地区冒着风雪造林。目前贵州、福建、陕西、广西、安徽、湖北、湖南、江苏、江西、四川、浙江、辽宁、河北十三个省、区，都先后提前超额完成了全年造林计划。
    在全民性的植树造林运动中，广大青少年是一支突击力量。他们积极响应党的号召，干劲十足。山东省一千六百万青少年和成年人一道已造林四百三十六万亩，四旁植树五亿三千万株，育苗十八万四千亩，营造青少年林二千七百余处。湖南省广大青少年已建立起林业基地三千五百四十五处，面积达八百多万亩；山西省平陆等十六个县的青少年已建立各种用材林、经济林基地六百多处，面积达十九万多亩。
    今年纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节的时候，全国妇女以植树造林的实际行动来迎接自己的节日。广东、广西、福建、河南、河北等许多省、区，还组织了妇女从事林业生产的专业队伍，建立了大量社办的妇女林场和专业队。
    在今春造林运动中，各地都认真贯彻了林业“三化”（基地化、林场化、丰产化）的方针。许多地区在造林之前都进行了规划。河北、河南、山西、山东、江苏、辽宁、安徽等缺材省、区，都在春季造林运动中大建自己的用材林基地。江苏省在徐淮矿区附近已经营造矿柱用材林六十六万亩。湖南、江西、福建、广东、广西、浙江等省、区，正大力建设以油茶为主的经济林基地和以杉木林为主的用材林基地。在大搞林业基地建设的同时，社办林场有了飞跃的发展。现在全国的社、队办林场已由去冬的二万多个，发展到七万七千多个。
    各地结合春季造林运动，大闹技术革新和技术革命群众运动，提高了劳动生产率，加速了造林的进度。黑龙江省龙江林场提出了依靠群众，自力更生、土洋结合，改制仿制，一物多用的办法，已制成种树机、铲趟机。福建浦城县大庄林场，许多林具已达到半机械化程度。
