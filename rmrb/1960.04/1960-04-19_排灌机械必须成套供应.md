Irrigation and Drainage Machinery Must Be Supplied as Complete Sets
By Our Own Commentator

Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued an emergency directive on mobilizing to combat drought, the workers on the agricultural machinery industry front immediately launched a mass movement to rush-produce and repair irrigation and drainage machinery. Now, a large number of irrigation and drainage machinery parts have been produced, some have already been assembled into complete sets and are being shipped to the countryside, while some have not yet been assembled and need to be quickly matched so that complete sets of irrigation and drainage machinery can head to the forefront of production.

Agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery is comprehensively composed of components such as power units, water pumps, water pipes, and rubber belts. Without a water pump, a power unit cannot be used; even with a power unit and a water pump, it is useless without water pipes and rubber belts. The prominent problem at present is that a considerable amount of horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery cannot be matched into sets. This is mainly manifested in the inconsistency of the models, quantities, and progress of production of power units, water pumps, water pipes, and rubber belts; in terms of models, there are large machines with small pumps; in terms of quantity, there are more machines than pumps, with many irrigation and drainage machines having machines but no pumps, or machines but no pipes. Therefore, the complete production and complete supply of irrigation and drainage machinery has become the central link in the current industrial support for agriculture to combat drought.

To solve this problem, first of all, all production departments of irrigation and drainage machinery must establish a unified production view. Whether we are producing main engines, auxiliary engines, or accessories, we are not producing for the sake of production, but for the sake of use, so that products can be assembled into sets in time, shipped to the countryside, and delivered for use. In this serious struggle to vigorously produce irrigation and drainage machinery and support agriculture in combating drought, all departments are shouldering major tasks in different aspects. If any department fails to produce, match, deliver, supply, and transport according to a unified plan, it will inevitably affect the supply of the entire irrigation and drainage machinery. The workers of the Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory in Jiangsu Province proposed: "Rather let the machine wait for the farming season, than let the farming season wait for the machine; rather trouble ourselves a thousand times, than make the farmers feel a little inconvenience." This kind of thinking, starting from production and considering the farmers, is correct. Irrigation and drainage machinery must rush ahead of the farming season, and relying solely on the power unit production department is not enough, requiring the concerted cooperation and great leap forward of all relevant departments. All must have the spirit of not being afraid of "troubling ourselves a thousand times," working together with one heart and one mind to deliver complete sets of irrigation and drainage machinery to the users in quantity and quality.

Of course, in the production process, all units will inevitably encounter some difficulties. The large quantity of irrigation and drainage machinery needed and the shortage of raw materials are difficulties; heavy tasks and tight deadlines are also difficulties. However, these difficulties can be solved. Regarding raw materials, we must not wait passively, but mobilize the masses and try every means to rely on our own efforts. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has fully mobilized the masses and relied on its own efforts to solve the problem of raw material shortage through the concerted efforts of industry, agriculture, and commerce departments. In order to seize time and rush the farming season, the workers of Wuxi Power Machinery Factory have carried out technological innovation and technological revolution, recently completing fifteen assembly lines and two automatic production lines, respectively increasing efficiency by one to twenty times, and completing the production tasks of irrigation and drainage machinery ahead of schedule. Shijiazhuang area has successfully modified low-pressure steam waterwheels, which do not use gasoline or cattle, and the water output is four times higher than that of ordinary waterwheels, and the structure is simple with fewer materials, making it easy to manufacture. Henan uses brick stoves instead of gasifier gas generators, greatly saving steel plates and making them easy to use. These facts fully demonstrate that the wisdom of the masses is inexhaustible. As long as we fully mobilize the masses, carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, and fight tenaciously against difficulties, we will definitely find ways to overcome difficulties and there will definitely be countless miracles.

At present, the drought situation in many regions of the country has not been eliminated, and the situation in individual regions is expanding. In the struggle to seize grain from the drought, the broad masses of farmers urgently need the industrial sector to support more and better irrigation and drainage machinery. We must promote the communist spirit of cooperation, take all effective measures, concentrate our efforts, make a concentrated effort to overcome the weak links of incomplete sets, so that irrigation and drainage machinery can be supplied to the rural areas as soon as possible to meet the needs of the drought resistance struggle, and realize the mechanization and water conservancy of irrigation and drainage as soon as possible.

    排灌机械必须成套供应
    本报评论员
    自从中共中央和国务院发出关于动员抗旱的紧急指示以后，农业机械工业战线上的职工立即掀起一个赶制排灌机械抢修排灌机械的群众运动。现在，大量的排灌机械部件已经生产出来了，有些已经装备成套，源源运到农村，有的还没有装备成套，需要迅速解决配套问题，让排灌机械成套的开赴生产第一线。
    农业排灌机械是由动力机、水泵、水管、胶带等部件综合组成的。只有动力机，没有水泵，就不能使用，有了动力机和水泵，没有水管和胶带，也不成。目前的突出问题是，有相当多马力的排灌机械不能配套。主要表现在动力机、水泵、水管、胶带生产的机型、数量、进度不一致，在机型上机大泵小；在数量上机多泵少，许多排灌机械有机无泵，或者有机无管。因此，排灌机械的成套生产、成套供应，就成为当前工业支援农业抗旱的中心环节。
    要解决这一问题，首先排灌机械的各生产部门，必须树立统一的生产观点，无论是生产主机、辅机或附件，我们不是为生产而生产，而是为了使用而生产，为了产品及时配成套，运往农村交付使用。在大力生产排灌机械，支援农业抗旱的这场严重斗争中，各部门都在不同方面肩负着重大的任务，任何一个部门如果不能按照统一的计划来生产、配套、交货、供销和运输，势必影响到整个排灌机械的供应。江苏无锡柴油机厂的职工提出：“宁让机器等农时，不让农时等机器，宁愿自己麻烦千遍，不让农民稍感不便。”这种从生产着眼，为农民着想的思想，是正确的。排灌机械要赶到农时的前边，仅靠生产动力机部门是不行的，需要各有关部门协同配合，一齐跃进。都要有不怕“自己麻烦千遍”的精神，同心合力，按量、按质地把成套排灌机械送到使用者手里。
    当然，在生产过程中，各单位都必然会遇到一些困难，排灌机械需要的数量多，原材料不足，是一个困难；任务繁重，时间紧迫，也有困难。但是，这些困难都是可以解决的。对于原材料，不能消极等待，而要发动群众，千方百计，自力更生。内蒙古自治区在党委的统一领导下，工、农、商等部门通力协作，充分发动群众，自力更生地解决了原材料不足的问题。无锡动力机械厂职工为了抢时间、赶农时，大搞技术革新和技术革命，他们最近搞成了十五条流水生产线、两条自动生产线，分别提高效率一至二十倍，提前完成了排灌机械的生产任务。石家庄地区改制成功了低压蒸汽水车，不用汽油，不用牛拉，出水量较一般水车提高四倍，并且结构简单用料较少，容易制造。河南用砖炉代替煤气机的煤气发生炉，大大节约了钢板，而且使用简便。这些事实充分说明，群众的智慧是无穷无尽的，只要充分发动群众，大闹技术革新和技术革命，顽强地向困难作斗争，就一定能找到克服困难的办法，就一定会出现无数的奇迹。
    目前，全国许多地区旱象仍未消除，个别地区且有扩大之势。广大农民在与旱象夺粮的斗争中，迫切需要工业部门支援更多更好的排灌机械。我们必须大兴共产主义协作之风，采取一切有效措施，集中力量，突击克服不配套的薄弱环节，让排灌机械尽快地成套供应农村抗旱斗争的需要，尽快地实现排灌机械化和水利化。
