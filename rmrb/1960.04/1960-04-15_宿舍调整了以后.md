	After the Dormitory Adjustment	Chen Pei
	
		The Lively Dormitory Area
	
	It was a clear holiday. I, facing the morning sun, arrived at the Yangquan No. 3 Mine. As soon as I got off the bus, I ran to the original office building to find the Party Committee. Huh! How did this become a miners' dormitory? "Where did the Party Committee move to?" "They moved to the Shaping Dormitory Area." When I found the Party Committee and pushed open the office door, I ran right into Comrade Zhang Jun'an. "Is Secretary Wang in?" "No, he went to visit the work teams today." What was the Party Secretary doing visiting the work teams? Little Zhang seemed to see my question and told me, "After adjusting the employee dormitories according to production units, the Party, Labor Union, and Communist Youth League offices all moved to the dormitory area. The Party Committee members often work in the employee dormitory area now." "Okay, then shall we go visit the work teams too?" The young man happily agreed.

	We walked along a wide, straight cement road. On both sides of this road, which stretches more than two miles north and south, were rows of miners' dormitories, one after another. People bustled back and forth. Almost every building's snow-white wall was covered with exciting good news and brightly colored cartoons. Every few steps, you could see colorful competition platforms, dedication platforms, model worker platforms, and leaping-forward gates, with thousands of red flags fluttering in the spring breeze. Along the way, we constantly saw signs marking "No. 1 Mine Worker Dormitory," "Baitouzui Pit Worker Dormitory," etc. Clubs, libraries, exhibition rooms, Party schools, Communist Youth League schools, Red and Expert schools, canteens, clinics, nursing homes, middle schools, department stores, theaters, stadiums, etc., were all available, and a cultural palace was under construction. Seeing all this, I couldn't help but say, "The changes here are really big!" Little Zhang smiled and said, "Do you remember? A few years ago, the workers had just moved from barren mountain earthen kilns into new houses. There were both day-shift and night-shift workers in one room. Workers from one team lived in several places, ten miles apart. If you wanted to have a heart-to-heart talk, you would run around all morning, get exhausted, and still hardly find anyone. It was even more difficult to organize workers for study, meetings, or cultural activities. Since the dormitory adjustment, workers' studies, meetings, competitions, evaluations, and cultural activities have all moved into the dormitory area, making it bustling with activity."

		Red, Diligent, Clever Mutual Aid Group

	As we spoke, we arrived at the Electromechanical Workers' Dormitory Area. Many doors had "Red, Diligent, Clever Mutual Aid Group" signs hanging on them, shining brightly, which caught my attention. I casually pushed open the door of one dormitory. Wow! What a beautiful dormitory! The windows were bright and clean, very tidy, and the room was filled with books and newspapers. A thin, young worker let us in. Little Zhang was familiar with him and asked with a smile, "Liu Jumo, what book are you reading?" "'Selected Works of Mao Zedong'." Little Zhang pointed to an empty bed next to him and asked, "Where's Hou Junye?" "He went to the factory as part of the Jinzhong area youth theory study guidance group." So, we chatted freely from studies and work to life. When we talked about their "Red, Diligent, Clever Mutual Aid Group," Little Liu said excitedly, "The mutual aid group is really great!" He then told this story: This was still last year's matter. In order to comprehensively improve the workers' political, technical, and cultural level, the Party Committee universally implemented "political, cultural, and technical three-way allocation" in each dormitory, meaning that each dormitory was also a "Red, Diligent, Clever Mutual Aid Group." Three young fitters lived in Little Liu's room. Hou Junye would pore over theory after work, while Liu Jumo didn't care about politics and just focused on technology. When they first moved in, the two often couldn't find common ground. However, they worked in the same group and slept in the same room, so how could they not influence each other over time? One night, the two young men were lying in bed, and Little Hou asked Little Liu, "What do people live for?" This question stumped Little Liu. Little Hou told Little Liu about the heroic deeds of Paul and Wu Yunduo, which moved Little Liu deeply. At the same time, he saw with his own eyes that Little Hou, who had joined the factory only a year later than him, had joined the Party and became a city-wide model of theoretical study and attended the National Youth Activists Congress because of his own efforts. Meanwhile, he himself had been preoccupied with his own "future" for several years and had achieved nothing, feeling very ashamed. From then on, he believed in the principles Little Hou spoke of and resolved to catch up. In the past year, he had studied more than ten theoretical books and was rated as a model student and technical innovation pacesetter. He also joined the Communist Youth League in November last year and wrote an application to join the Party. At the same time, Little Liu also helped Little Hou technically. After work in the evening, the two studied technology in the dormitory. In the past year, they had jointly researched and innovated more than ten machines and tools, improving efficiency by one to fourteen times, and both had advanced one level in technology. There are many similar touching stories.

		A Debate

	After leaving Little Liu's, we went to the No. 1 Mine Worker Dormitory, where we happened to find Secretary Wang and Shi Degui, the director of the No. 1 Mine pit. As we talked, we talked about the dormitory adjustment again. Secretary Wang said with a hearty laugh, "After adjusting the dormitories, I live and work with the workers, and our relationship is even closer. When I first moved into the dormitory, the workers saw that my quilt was thin and scrambled to give me their quilts, but I refused. But after I fell asleep, the workers quietly put them on me..."

	"Haha! Haha!" A burst of laughter interrupted our conversation. Through the bright glass window, we saw a group of workers sitting in the sun, talking and laughing, seemingly chatting and holding a meeting. What were they doing? Director Shi Degui said, "The workers of the Third Team are holding an economic activity analysis meeting. Now the dormitory can not only solve the problems of life and study but also solve management problems." Director Shi told me about such a vivid debate: In April and May of last year, the Third Team was transferred to a new working face, and the consumption of pit props was very large, mainly because some people didn't cherish them. One day, the worker Zhang Wuyuan, in order to save trouble when setting the roof, pressed a large beam that could have been recovered into the goaf. After work that day, an economic activity analysis meeting was held in the dormitory. Lu Gengwang, the cost team leader, asked Lao Zhang, "Do you think that beam can be recovered today?" Zhang Wuyuan said, "Losing a pit prop is nothing." Gengwang said, "You can't say that. It's not easy to get a pit prop! A tree that thick has to grow for at least ten years, and it has to be transported to the mine for processing by train and ship. How much blood and sweat does that take! If you calculate it, the cost of that beam is at least thirty yuan. You only want to save a little trouble, and small interests damage big interests." Gao Laitou also added, "Let's calculate the political cost. In the past, when we went down the kiln to mine coal for the capitalists, they were reluctant to buy us pit props. Now, our country's timber is not sufficient. In order to ensure our safety, the Party keeps sending us pit props. If we don't cherish them, who are we worthy of?" Some also said, "If we want to surpass Britain, how can we surpass them if production stops without pit props?" Everyone spoke at once, and several accounts made Zhang Wuyuan feel enlightened and ashamed. Jia Sikui, who was sitting on the side, was also deeply moved and automatically examined himself, saying, "My mistake is even bigger than Wuyuan's. I've lost even more pit props. I will resolutely correct it from tomorrow." The debate educated the whole team. Everyone pondered how to reduce the consumption of pit props. One person offered one idea, and they put together a covenant to cherish pit props and decided to promote metal supports. In this way, the Third Team's consumption of pit props decreased from fifteen cubic meters per thousand tons of coal in April and May to only five cubic meters per thousand tons of coal.

	Night fell. As I sat in the car on my way home, I looked back from the car window at the lights of the dormitory area, shining like stars scattered in the sky. Lovely mine, you have experienced another transformation! How happy the miners are to live in such a happy, harmonious, friendly, mutual-aid, and warm family!

### 宿舍调整了以后

    宿舍调整了以后	陈霈
            热闹的宿舍区
    这是一个晴朗的假日，我迎着早晨的太阳，来到阳泉三矿。一下汽车，我就跑到原来的办公大楼找党委会。咦！这里怎么变成矿工宿舍了？“党委会搬到哪去了？”“搬到沙坪宿舍区了。”当我找到党委会，推开办公室的门，正碰上张钧安同志在那里。“王书记在吗？”“不在，他今天串工房去了。”党委书记串工房有什么事呢？小张好像看出了我的疑问，便告诉我说：“按生产单位调整职工宿舍以后，党、工、团的办公室都搬到了宿舍区，党委委员们工作时就经常在职工宿舍区里。”“好吧，那咱们也去串串工房好吗？”小伙子愉快地答应了。
    我们顺着一条宽阔笔直的洋灰路走去。在这条横贯南北二里多长的马路两旁，排满了一幢接着一幢的矿工宿舍。人们熙来攘往。几乎每幢宿舍雪白的墙上都贴着激动人心的捷报，画着色彩鲜艳的漫画；每隔几步就可以看到万紫千红的竞赛台、献礼台、标兵台、跃进门，千百面红旗迎着春风招展。一路上，不断看到标明“一号井工人宿舍”“白头嘴坑工人宿舍”……的牌子。俱乐部、图书室、展览室、党校、团校、红专学校、食堂、医疗所、敬老院、中学、百货商店、影剧院、运动场等应有尽有，还有一座文化宫正在修建。看到这些，我情不自禁地说：“这儿变化可真大呀！”小张笑着说：“你还记得吧！前几年，工人们刚刚从荒山土窑搬进了新房子里，一间屋里上白班、上夜班的都有；一个组的工人住了好几处，相距十来里，想谈谈心，跑一上午，累个死也难得找到一个人，要想组织工人学习、开会、搞文娱活动，那就更困难了。自从调整宿舍以后，工人学习、开会、搞竞赛评比、文娱活动都搬进了宿舍区，才把这里闹得热火朝天。”
            红勤巧互助组
    边说着，我们已经来到了机电工人宿舍区。许多门上挂着“红勤巧互助组”的牌子，闪闪发光，引起了我的注意。我随手推开一间宿舍的门，嗬！好漂亮的宿舍呀！窗明几净，非常整洁，屋里还摆着许多书报。一位瘦瘦的年青工人把我们让了进来。小张跟他很熟悉，笑着问：“刘巨模，你看的什么书？”“看‘毛选’”。小张指旁边一张空床问：“侯俊业呢？”“参加晋中区青年理论学习督导团下厂了。”于是，我们便毫无拘束地从学习、工作又扯到生活。当扯到他们的“红勤巧互助组”时，小刘激动地说：“提起互助组可真是太好了！”他便讲起这样一段故事：这，还是去年的事情，党委为了全面提高工人政治、技术、文化水平，就在各寝室普遍实行了“政治、文化、技术三配备”，一间寝室也就是一个“红勤巧互助组”。小刘这间屋里住着三个青年钳工。侯俊业下了班就死啃理论；刘巨模不问政治，死钻技术。刚搬来，两人老说不到一块。可是，他俩同组劳动，同室共眠，天长日久怎么能不发生一点影响呢？一天晚上，两个小伙子躺在床上，小侯问小刘：“人活着究竟为了什么？”这一下可把小刘问住了。小侯就给小刘讲保尔和吴运铎的英雄事迹，小刘听了很受感动。同时，他亲眼看到比他入厂还晚一年的小侯，由于自己努力，入了党，还当了全市理论学习模范，参加了全国青年积极分子大会，而自己因为只在个人“前途”上打圈子，几年来碌碌无为，感到十分惭愧。从这以后，他相信了小侯讲的那些道理，下定决心奋起直追。一年来，他已学过十多本理论书，被评为学习模范和技术革新标兵，去年11月还入了团，又写了入党申请书。同时，小刘也从技术上帮助小侯。晚上下班后，两人在宿舍里钻研技术。一年来，他们共同钻研革新了十多件机具，提高效率一至十四倍，而且两人在技术上都进了一级。类似这样感人的故事是很多的。
            一场辩论会
    从小刘那里出来，我们到了一号井工人宿舍，可巧王书记和一号井坑主任史德贵也在这里。我们谈着谈着，又说到了调整宿舍的事情。王书记爽朗地笑着说：“调整了宿舍，我跟工人们睡觉、劳动都在一起，关系更亲近了。我刚搬进工房，工人看我被子薄就抢着给我被子，我不肯要。可是等我睡着了，工人们又悄悄地给我盖上了……”
    “哈哈！哈哈！”一阵笑声打断了我们的谈话。透过明亮的玻璃窗户看到一伙工人坐在太阳地里，有说有笑，好像聊天，又像开会。这是干什么呢？史德贵主任说：“这是三队工人们正开经济活动分析会呢。现在宿舍里不仅能解决生活和学习问题，还能解决管理问题呢。”史主任给我讲了这样一次生动的辩论会：去年4、5月份，三队调到一个新工作面，坑木消耗很大。主要是有些人不爱惜坑木。有一天，工人张五元放顶时光图省事，把一根本来可以回收的大梁给压在落山里了。当天下班后，在宿舍里就开了个经济活动分析会。成本组长吕更旺问老张：“你说今天那根大梁能不能回收出来？”张五元说：“丢根坑木算不了什么。”更旺说：“可不能那么说，一根坑木来得多不容易呀！像那么粗的树，至少也要长十来年，从栽种到长大，又用火车、轮船送到矿上加工，这要多少人的血汗呀！你再算算，这根大梁成本至少有三十多块钱，你光图一时省事，小利益就损害了大利益。”高来头也接着说：“咱再算算政治账，过去替资本家下窑挖煤，他哪舍得给咱买坑木。现在，咱们国家的木材并不充足，党为了保证咱们的安全，不断给咱们运来坑木，咱们要是不爱惜，对得起谁呢？”也有的说：“咱们要超过英国，如果没有坑木停了产，那怎么超呢？”你一言我一语地，几笔账算得张五元心里又亮堂又惭愧。坐在一旁的贾四奎也深受感动，自动检讨说：“我比五元错误还大，丢的坑木更多，从明天起就坚决改正。”一场辩论教育了全组，大家就琢磨着怎么能降低坑木消耗，你一条我一条就凑起了个爱惜坑木的公约，并且决定推广金属支柱。就这样，三队的坑木消耗由3、4月份每千吨煤用十五立方，下降到每千吨煤只用五立方。
          ×　×　×
    夜，降临了。当我坐着汽车走上归途时，回头从车窗里望见宿舍区的万家灯火，犹如天上撒下的星星闪烁发光。可爱的矿山，你又经历了一次变革！生活在这样一个欢乐、和睦、友爱、互助和温暖的大家庭中的矿工们，是多么幸福！
