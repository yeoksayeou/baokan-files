    I Love "A Trip to Dali"
    The color landscape documentary "A Trip to Dali," produced by the Kunming Film Studio, is a documentary that I really love. The film captures the famous mountains and beautiful rivers of Dali and the working lives of the Bai ethnic brothers; at the same time, it combines the beautiful local folk legends and myths, uses poetry as narration, and is accompanied by music with local characteristics, beautifully reflecting the scenery of Dali.
    After watching this film, I not only developed a stronger love for the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland and a longing for Dali, but also gained a certain understanding of the past hardships and sufferings of the Bai brothers and their happy lives today.
    Our motherland is a magnificent and multi-ethnic family. I hope that film studios in various regions will also produce similar documentaries.	  Hangzhou University, Wang Jiabang

    我喜爱“大理行”
    昆明电影制片厂拍摄的彩色山水纪录片“大理行”，是我很喜爱的一部纪录片。影片拍摄了大理地方的名山秀水和白族兄弟的劳动生活；同时，结合着当地的优美的民间传说和神话，用诗来作解说词，用带有地方特色的音乐伴奏，十分优美地反映了大理的风光。
    看了这部片子之后，不但对祖国的锦绣山河有了更强烈的热爱，对大理产生了向往；同时，对白族兄弟过去的辛酸痛苦和今天的幸福生活也有了一定程度的了解。
    我们的祖国是一个河山壮丽、多民族的大家庭，我希望各地的电影制片厂，也摄制类似这样的纪录片。	  杭州大学　王加邦
