    Japanese Militarism's Aggressive Ambitions Fully Exposed
    Kishi Nobusuke Clamors that Japanese Troops Can Act Abroad
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi openly clamored on the 5th that Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" "can take action in certain areas of the high seas and airspace."

    In order to create a pretext for dispatching Japanese troops abroad for aggression, Nobusuke Kishi said in response to a question at the House of Representatives "Security Treaty" Special Committee meeting that "regarding the issue of the boundaries of a country's territorial waters and airspace, there is still room for discussion."

    He also said that Japan's existing constitution, which renounces war, "does not exclude" Japan from exercising "the right of self-defense" when its own territory is subjected to so-called "foreign armed attack."

    Nobusuke Kishi also said that if subjected to "foreign armed attack," the U.S. forces stationed in Japan "can take action" to attack foreign military bases. Nobusuke Kishi's words clearly show that the Nobusuke Kishi government is creating various pretexts to prepare to send troops abroad again for aggression.

    日本军国主义侵略野心毕露
    岸信介叫嚣日军可以出国行动
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介5日公开叫嚷，日本“自卫队”“可以在某些地方的公海和空中采取行动”。
    为了替派遣日本军队出国侵略制造借口，岸信介在众议院“安全条约”特别委员会会议上答复质询时说，“关于一个国家的领海和领空的界限问题，还有讨论的余地。”
    他还说，日本现有的规定放弃战争的宪法“并不排除”日本在自己的领土受到所谓“外来的武装进攻”时行使“自卫权”。
    岸信介还说，如果受到“外来的武装进攻”，驻日美军“可以采取行动”攻击外国的军事基地。岸信介的话清楚地表明，岸信介政府正在制造准备再把军队派到国外去进行侵略的各种借口。
