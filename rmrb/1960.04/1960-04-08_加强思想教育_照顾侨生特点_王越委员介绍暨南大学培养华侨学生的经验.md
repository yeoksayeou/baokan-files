Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft 1960 National Economic Plan" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the Draft 1960 National Budget." I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report.

Currently, the people of the whole country are paying close attention to the issue of Overseas Chinese. I would like to talk about the education of returned Overseas Chinese students, and also to let Overseas Chinese abroad understand the situation of their children studying at our school.

Earnestly Implement the Party's Education Policy

Our Jinan University is a comprehensive university tasked with cultivating returned Overseas Chinese students and Hong Kong and Macau students. Since its establishment in the autumn of 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line and with the continuous care and guidance of the Party, we have adhered to the Party's education policy, deeply unfolded the education revolution, and achieved many successes. Like the continuous and comprehensive leaping-forward situation of the motherland, it is developing rapidly. Currently, our school has nine departments including Mining and Metallurgy, Aquaculture, Navigation, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Chinese Language, History, and Economics, eighteen majors, and one preparatory course. This year, there are more than 1,700 students, of whom more than 900 are Overseas Chinese students, accounting for more than 50% of the total number of students in the school.

Our Party and motherland have always been concerned about and attached importance to the education of Overseas Chinese students. Recently, due to the anti-China wave stirred up by some forces in Indonesia that are hostile to China and Indonesian friendship, Chinese schools have been forced to close. More and more Overseas Chinese students are forced and consciously requesting to return to the motherland to study and work. The continuous leap forward of industry and agriculture in the motherland, and the great development of culture, science, and education, require a large number of talents to engage in socialist construction, opening up broad prospects for Overseas Chinese youth to return to the country to study and work. A large number of Overseas Chinese students returning from Indonesia will soon enter our school to study. Our school has made active arrangements in terms of course offerings and living conditions; all faculty and students warmly welcome the arrival of returning Overseas Chinese students. Therefore, the education of Overseas Chinese students is even more important, and the responsibility borne by our school is particularly heavy.

Since most Overseas Chinese students have spent most of their time growing up in capitalist countries or imperialist colonies, suffering the pain of multiple oppressions, they have national liberation and democratic revolution thoughts, tend to be progressive, and can also accept socialist ideas well after studying. On the other hand, due to the increasing strength of the socialist motherland and the increasing international prestige and status, their patriotism is stronger than in any previous period. They feel infinitely invigorated by the prosperity and strength of the motherland, and patriotism has become one of the constantly functioning driving forces for their study, work, and pursuit of progress.

Generally speaking, Overseas Chinese students are diligent in their studies, enthusiastic in their work, can obey leadership, respect teachers, have a kind attitude towards others, are receptive to new things, are unwilling to lag behind, and are eager to make progress. They hope to be treated equally with domestic students, do not ask for special care, and want a diversified, lively, and vigorous life. After a short period of remedial study, the vast majority of students can quickly catch up with the level of domestic students in both culture and politics, and their progress is very rapid. All of these are the positive aspects of Overseas Chinese students.

However, since Overseas Chinese students have only recently returned to the country and have been living abroad for a long time, they have been influenced by bourgeois education to varying degrees, and have varying degrees of bourgeois individualism. In addition, they have been influenced by imperialist and reactionary propaganda to varying degrees, and some people do not have a deep understanding of the socialist motherland and their understanding of the Party and socialism is still vague. Of course, this is the negative side, which is caused by the objective environment in the past and is not surprising. As long as we strengthen leadership and education, their shortcomings can be overcome.

We believe that in the school, as long as we vigorously strengthen the Party's leadership, take Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, adhere to the mass line, implement the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," and implement the principles of "treating Overseas Chinese students equally and providing appropriate care" and "giving free rein to training, strengthening education, and considering characteristics," be good at using encouragement, praise as the main method, patient education, and cordial care, give play to the positive aspects, overcome the negative aspects, we will definitely be able to accelerate their education and help them accelerate their growth, so that they can better serve socialist construction. The achievements made by our school in the education of Overseas Chinese students over the past year, especially since the anti-Rightist, all-out effort socialist education movement, are a powerful proof.

Triple Harvest in Ideology, Teaching, and Labor

Over the past academic year, under the situation of the continued great leap forward in socialist construction in the motherland, under the direct leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the University Party Committee, and with the care of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central Government and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Guangdong Province, in the second half of last year, under the guidance of the principle of "taking the anti-Rightist rectification movement as the key link to drive the comprehensive leap forward of work," all aspects of the school's work saw a continued leap forward and achieved obvious results, achieving no delay in the movement, teaching (scientific research), and productive labor, thereby achieving a triple harvest in political ideology, teaching (scientific research), and productive labor.

Through Ideological Education, Patriotism and Collectivism of Overseas Chinese Students Generally Increased

The Party cultivated our Overseas Chinese students as diligently as a gardener cares for seedlings, caring for their growth at all times. The Party's education has enabled them to take a big step from their original democratic ideas to socialist and communist ideas. The political and ideological outlook of Overseas Chinese students has undergone fundamental and qualitative changes. After studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, they saw that the leading comrades of the school Party committee took the lead in seriously and earnestly examining some of their own erroneous ideas, and showed a high sense of responsibility to the motherland and the people. Many Overseas Chinese students were moved to tears and said: "The Party Committee told us even about the slightest shortcomings, and veteran cadres who have been working for decades have deeply examined their own erroneous ideas. What is worth retaining in those decadent bourgeois ideas that influence us?" Under the leadership of the school Party committee, the Overseas Chinese students immediately launched a massive, widespread, and profound socialist education movement, posting big-character posters or examining and criticizing their own bourgeois individualist ideas in group meetings. For example, before returning to China, Chen Zhongping, a student in the History Department, his father took out his broken clothes and ragged coats from thirty years ago when he went abroad and said to him: "I went abroad like this before. You are extremely happy now. After returning to China, you must study hard and never fail the government's education and expectations." However, after returning to China, he lived freely and loosely, eating and drinking extravagantly, and did not study hard. In this study, when he recalled his father's parting instructions, he sobbed. He criticized his forgetfulness; now he is very active in his work, has excellent academic performance, and was rated as a shock worker in labor. He said with great emotion: "We returned Overseas Chinese students can only listen to the Party, resolutely follow the Party, and strictly demand ourselves to have a bright future." His words revealed the innermost thoughts of the Overseas Chinese students.

In this socialist education movement, due to the increased awareness of the students, it was revealed that a few Overseas Chinese students wanted to return overseas. After socialist education, they expressed their determination to the Party, saying, "I am Chinese, I want to serve the people of the motherland, and even if I die, I will die in China." The rapid development of industry, agriculture, and cultural education in the motherland has given Overseas Chinese a strong backing, no longer orphans overseas; however, they are still living a life away from their hometowns, drifting overseas, and suffering deeply from the hardships of living under someone else's roof. When returned Overseas Chinese students returned to the motherland, they felt warmth and happiness as if they had been thrown into the arms of their own mothers. They said: "Capitalist society turns us from people into ghosts, and the socialist motherland turns us from ghosts into people." They deeply fell in love with the Party, the powerful socialist motherland, and the working people. When floods hit last year, Overseas Chinese students demanded to participate in flood prevention and rescue and go to the front line of the battle. When they were not approved, they actively donated more than 8,000 items to support the disaster-stricken people. This specifically demonstrated the continuous growth of patriotism and communist ideas among Overseas Chinese students. Under the education and cultivation of the Party, class friendship and collectivism have been gradually established, and an atmosphere of mutual learning and mutual assistance has generally formed in our school. In winter, individual worker-peasant students were not warm enough, and Overseas Chinese students enthusiastically gave up their quilts. Female students patched clothes for male students. During the period of sending down to the countryside, worker-peasant students helped weak students carry luggage... Examples are too numerous to mention. The students criticized bourgeois individualistic ideas and established communist ideas of cherishing the collective and striving for collective honor. For example, Class 1 of the Aquaculture major in the first grade of the Department of Aquaculture is a classic example. There are a total of 45 students in the class, of which 32 are Overseas Chinese students, accounting for 71.1% of the total number of students in the class. Female students account for the majority. At the beginning, many students did not love their major, thinking that raising fish was a shameful thing. The political atmosphere was weak, learning discipline was very poor, and labor and unity were not done well, especially between male and female students who ignored each other and avoided each other. However, in the socialist education movement, they received a profound education and established a strong sense of collective honor. The class fundamentally changed its past backwardness, and the whole class was unprecedentedly united and became a red-banner class in the whole school. They brought into play the spirit of mutual assistance in learning, ensuring that 95.5% of the whole class achieved excellent results, and 100% participated in scientific research activities. In the labor of digging "Ming Lake," they completed a week's task in three and a half days and were rated as an advanced commando team in the whole school. , the first literary and artistic advanced class in the school, and the class's League branch was also rated as the first red-flag branch in the school.

Through Labor Training, Cultivated Labor Views and Labor Habits of Overseas Chinese Students

Labor training greatly improved the class feelings, labor views, and labor habits of Overseas Chinese students. They deeply realized that only through labor training and integrating with worker-peasant students can they carry out serious transformation, regenerate themselves, and become builders of socialism. Last winter, in order to express their welcome to Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, who also served as the principal of our school, and to express their gratitude to the Party for its great care for returned Overseas Chinese students, the Overseas Chinese students joined the faculty and students of the whole school in the battle to build "Ming Lake" and completed the artificial lake project with a width of 24 mu one month ahead of schedule, saving the country more than 31,000 yuan. Many students who had just returned to China and some students who were weak in health were taken care of by the leadership and were not allowed to participate in more strenuous labor, but as soon as they were mobilized to go back, they reappeared on the construction site in the blink of an eye. At the celebration meeting for the completion of "Ming Lake," 30% of Overseas Chinese students were rated as glorious labor shock workers. Some people worried that Overseas Chinese students would damage their health by participating in labor. Countless facts have shown that this worry is superfluous and unfounded. Take Huang Yuzhu, a student from our school, for example. After returning to China, she participated in the national steelmaking movement. Labor made her stronger and her weight increased by eight pounds. Under the education and cultivation of the League organization, she recently gloriously joined the Communist Youth League, but her mother overseas always thought that she must be thin and out of shape. She wrote to her to return to Indonesia. Later, when she saw the photos sent back by Huang Yuzhu, she was surprised and happy. Not only did she put down her heart, but she also recently sent Huang Yuzhu's younger brother back to China to take the university entrance examination.

The already progressive and fiery hearts of Overseas Chinese students are all aimed at one goal - to strive to build a strong socialist motherland, and they have asked to convene a school-wide "Overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao Students Leap Forward Pledge Meeting." At the meeting, all Overseas Chinese students under the brilliant banner of Mao Zedong issued a fighting oath "to always listen to the Party, always follow the Party, and be determined to learn from the noble qualities of worker-peasant students, such as selflessness, hard work, simple living, diligence in research, and selfless work. The conference elected 58 outstanding Overseas Chinese, Hong Kong, and Macao students, who were praised by the conference and became pacesetters in the whole school. After the meeting, they responded to the Party's call and launched a high tide of studying Mao Zedong Thought, and universally established Mao Zedong Thought study groups. Under their active impetus, foreign students also took the initiative to request to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study. Mao Zedong Thought illuminated every Overseas Chinese student, such as Overseas Chinese student Lin Hanzhong said: "After studying Chairman Mao's works, my thinking was encouraged, and my lazy ideas were overcome." At present, they are using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, combined with the problems existing in themselves, and writing special articles, reading notes, and papers. Through learning, their ideological understanding has been improved. Among them, there has been a general phenomenon of two less - less going to the streets and less ideological problems; five more - more subscriptions to newspapers and periodicals, more reading, more striving for social work, more requests to join the Party and the League, and more writing of articles. They are eager to make progress politically. In the past year, 70 Overseas Chinese students have joined the Communist Youth League, and 100% of the Overseas Chinese students in the second grade of the Chinese Department and the first grade of the Aquaculture Department have applied to join the League.

All of the above fully demonstrates that under the cultivation and education of the Party, the political ideology of Overseas Chinese students in our school has made a great leap forward. When the anti-China and anti-Chinese wave appeared in Indonesia, when they discussed Foreign Minister Chen's proposal, they revealed the truth about the anti-Chinese incidents and the conspiracy of US imperialism, and were infinitely angry at the unreasonable anti-China and anti-Chinese behavior launched by some forces in Indonesia that were hostile to China and Indonesian friendship. They expressed their determination to strengthen unity, to study hard and diligently for the socialist construction of the motherland, to actively participate in labor training, to accelerate their cultivation into working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert, and to contribute all their strength to the socialist cause. And they support the State Council's instructions on receiving and resettling returned Overseas Chinese students with practical actions, giving up good dormitories and classrooms, and expressing a warm welcome to the Overseas Chinese students who have recently returned to our school to study.

Consolidated Professional Ideas, Corrected Learning Attitude, Clarified Learning Purpose, and Greatly Improved Learning Enthusiasm of Overseas Chinese Students

With the great victory of the rectification movement, with the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, with the implementation of the Party's education policy and the deepening of the education revolution, and with the great improvement of the political and ideological level of Overseas Chinese students, criticizing individualism in learning motivation, students have changed from thinking that Jinan University is a newly established school with conditions that cannot compare with old universities, a new brand, and not ideal, to loving Jinan University and being reluctant to leave Jinan University, from not being at ease in learning a major to loving a major, correcting the learning attitude, clarifying the learning purpose, independent thinking and collective mutual assistance have become a trend, and learning enthusiasm has been greatly improved. Learning methods are constantly being improved, and creative teaching and learning have achieved remarkable results. For example, in the second-year Russian class of the History Department, with the joint efforts of teachers and students, a large amount of extracurricular reading, learning and using (translating at the same time) has been created, and more classroom questions are used to replace simple teacher lectures... These methods have achieved good results. , the teaching time has been reduced by more than one-third, and the learning effect has been greatly improved compared with the past. The students can already translate the new edition of "History of the CPSU" independently. Most of the students in the class have reached the level of the second year of Russian specialization or the third year of ordinary university. The academic performance of other subjects has also been greatly improved. For example, 24 Overseas Chinese students in the Economics Department studied the course "Economic Calculation." Before the socialist education movement, the excellent results only accounted for 74%, and the unqualified accounted for 22%. After the movement, the ideological understanding was improved and the enthusiasm was boosted. 100% achieved excellent results. In terms of scientific research, in the past, many Overseas Chinese students were still laymen. They believed that first-year students did not have professional knowledge and could not talk about any scientific research at all. Moreover, scientific research was the work of research institutions. How could university freshmen engage in scientific research? However, the Overseas Chinese students who have liberated their minds are now different. After the school Party committee put forward the call for February Red, the teachers and students of the whole school responded unanimously and carried out a mass movement for scientific research. In just over 20 days, the whole school completed 151 scientific research projects, and Overseas Chinese students participated 100%, dedicating their greatest strength. For example, Lai Xifang and other 23 returned Overseas Chinese students from the Chinese Department wrote a long novel of 150,000 words, and Overseas Chinese students from the Mining and Metallurgy Department worked with their classmates to make high-pressure thermocouples in more than 20 days. Overseas Chinese students from the Chinese Department and teachers and students from the whole department used their holidays to conduct investigations and interviews in various places and jointly wrote the special collection "Lingnan Scenery" and collected many folk songs... At the March 2nd meeting to report good news to the Party, the students showed their skills and contributed their gifts, which were exhibited in the exhibition hall to report good news to the Party. It showed that the teachers and students of the whole school are united under the leadership of the Party, liberate their minds, dare to think and dare to do, and it concentrated the wisdom of the teachers and students of the whole school and reflected the achievements of the teachers and students of the whole school. This fully demonstrated the victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the victory of the Party's education policy. Overseas Chinese students especially like and are good at cultural and sports activities and pay attention to hygiene, and they naturally become the backbone of the cultural, sports, and hygiene work team in our school. The school's art troupe has performed at the Guangzhou Military Region and the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Students Congress and has been well received. This is not only because Overseas Chinese students have this hobby, or the programs have a special flavor and are fresh and attractive, but more importantly, after they have improved their ideological understanding, based on socialist literary and artistic ideas, they do not rigidly copy overseas songs and dances, but rather analyze and criticize and absorb the strengths of others and improve them. They have also received friendly artistic guidance and assistance from the soldiers' song and dance troupe and the South China song and dance troupe, and creatively rehearsed many literary and artistic programs with a certain level.

Experience in Cultivating Overseas Chinese Students

How to cultivate Overseas Chinese students into talents for building a socialist motherland? Based on our preliminary exploration of our work, we believe that returned Overseas Chinese youth, like domestic youth, can fully accept socialist education. We strive to implement the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor in our education work, so that we can cultivate Overseas Chinese students to achieve all-round development and become talents who are both red and expert in the future. However, as mentioned above, due to the influence of the past environment and education, returned Overseas Chinese students have some characteristics in terms of political ideology and the level of certain subjects when they return to China. We have obtained the following three points from the education work of Overseas Chinese students for more than a year:

First, the political significance of the education of Overseas Chinese students must be fully estimated and recognized. Since liberation, more and more Overseas Chinese students have returned to the motherland to study. They all have a fiery heart of loving the motherland and have a grand vision of participating in socialist construction. Strengthening their education and cultivation can greatly expand the ranks of intellectuals who build socialism, and will play an important role in uniting the vast number of Overseas Chinese overseas and in the struggle for world lasting peace and anti-colonialism.

We should fully estimate and recognize the serious political significance of the education of Overseas Chinese students, so that we can strengthen our sense of responsibility to the Party, to the motherland, and to the education of Overseas Chinese students and Overseas Chinese, and complete the education of returned Overseas Chinese students as an extremely important political task.

Second, a correct estimate of the characteristics of Overseas Chinese students is necessary to educate them according to their characteristics and guide them according to circumstances. In the education of Overseas Chinese students, some comrades in the past believed that Overseas Chinese students were deeply influenced by bourgeois education and had more complicated social relations, exaggerating the negative side of Overseas Chinese students and believing that it was more difficult to educate Overseas Chinese students. This estimate and view are incorrect.

It should be pointed out that due to the increasingly strong socialist motherland, the increasingly obvious superiority of the socialist system, and the correct policies adopted by the Party and the government for Overseas Chinese students, a powerful driving force has been formed to promote the progress of Overseas Chinese students; on the other hand, because Overseas Chinese students love the motherland and have democratic revolution and anti-imperialist ideas, their investment in the embrace of the motherland indicates that they are willing to accept the education of the motherland. As long as we are good at enlightenment education, presenting facts, reasoning, focusing on the comparison between the old and new societies, patiently persuading, guiding them from nationalist ideas to socialist ideas, and clearly running this red line through the education process, we will definitely be able to guide them to love the socialist motherland, support the leadership of the Party, support the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and cultivate them into talents for building a socialist motherland.

Third, strengthen the education of Overseas Chinese students in accordance with the principle of "giving free rein to training, strengthening education, and considering characteristics."

In the education of Overseas Chinese students, if there is right-leaning thinking, emphasizing the negative side of Overseas Chinese students, taking a compromising approach, satisfying their improper demands, and treating Overseas Chinese students with an accommodating attitude, this will hinder the progress of Overseas Chinese students; on the contrary, we fully estimate that Overseas Chinese students are eager to make progress, have a strong desire to advance together with domestic students, and fully estimate the possibility of rapid transformation of their positive and negative sides, so as to give free rein to training and carry out positive education, we will definitely be able to accelerate the education of Overseas Chinese students and complete the task of cultivating Overseas Chinese students more, faster, better, and more economically. The achievements made by our school since its establishment in adhering to the Party's education policy and adopting a free rein to training for Overseas Chinese students fully prove this point.

Giving free rein to training is one aspect of strengthening education. Since the establishment of the school, in addition to studying, living, engaging in productive labor, and scientific research together with domestic students, we have also conducted socialist education for Overseas Chinese students through various visits; through situation education, we have enlightened Overseas Chinese students to recognize the current domestic and international situation and continuously improve their political and ideological level; through Party committee leadership, the combination of teachers and students, and the combination of teaching, scientific research, and productive labor, we have implemented the Party's education policy. Responsible comrades of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central Government and Comrade Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee and Principal of our school, gave meticulous care to Overseas Chinese students. Other responsible comrades of the Guangdong Provincial Party and government also came to the school to report to and discuss with Overseas Chinese students, and solved the problems existing in their ideology and life, caring for them meticulously like gardeners care for seedlings; convened Overseas Chinese students to leap forward and take a pledge, praised the advanced, established pacesetters, and formed their own advanced team to drive other Overseas Chinese students; the Student Union established an Overseas Chinese Student Department to strengthen Overseas Chinese students' own education. This series of practices has greatly strengthened the training of Overseas Chinese students and greatly accelerated the process of cultivating Overseas Chinese students.

In the process of educating Overseas Chinese students, while preventing right-leaning thinking, we must also prevent "left" leaning thinking, only seeing equal treatment and neglecting appropriate care. On the one hand, we must give free rein to training for Overseas Chinese students, and on the other hand, we must take care of their characteristics. After all, they have only recently returned to the country and have received a shorter period of education in the motherland; moreover, their homes are overseas and far away; and in terms of living habits, there are still some differences. Therefore, while giving equal treatment and giving free rein to training, it is necessary to combine their characteristics and give appropriate care and patient education. The school Party committee and administration have strengthened individual tutoring for Overseas Chinese students who have more difficulties in learning, and have always been concerned about and taken care of the lives of Overseas Chinese students. If Overseas Chinese students are sick, the school will send them to sanatoriums for recuperation, and some teachers will personally cook medicine for them; the school actively provides scholarships to Overseas Chinese students who are economically difficult. The school Party committee and administration learned about and resolved the problems in a timely manner. They often held discussions with them to stabilize their learning mood. During festivals, the school Party committee and administrative leaders invited Overseas Chinese students to their homes for dinner together and traveled and talked with them, and organized rich and colorful cultural and entertainment evenings, giving meticulous care. This made these Overseas Chinese students who were far away from their relatives feel as warm as at home. Overseas Chinese student Cao Xiangrui recalled that when his father was at the old Jinan University, he would crawl into his bed during festivals, suffering from hunger and no one would ask. Comparing it with today's life, he felt especially happy, and many Overseas Chinese students made a vow: "Listen to the Party and always follow the Party." In this way, they are motivated to study more consciously and grow more rapidly.

Since our school was founded not long ago, our experience is not rich enough, and the political and ideological education of Overseas Chinese students still needs to be further refined and deepened to find some relatively mature rules; the progress of some Overseas Chinese students still needs to be consolidated; some Overseas Chinese students are still making progress slowly; and the negative factors of individual Overseas Chinese students have not been overcome. These shortcomings still need to accumulate more experience to further improve our work. We hope that comrades who care about Overseas Chinese education will not hesitate to give us advice and point out the negligence and shortcomings in our work, so that we can correct our mistakes in time, overcome our shortcomings, continuously improve our work, and continuously move forward, and contribute greater strength to the socialist Overseas Chinese education cause of the motherland.

专栏：

    加强思想教育　照顾侨生特点
    王越委员介绍暨南大学培养华侨学生的经验主席、各位委员：
    我对于李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”完全拥护。对陈叔通副主席的工作报告完全同意。
    现在全国人民都很注意华侨的问题，我想就归国华侨学生的教育问题谈一谈，也想使海外侨胞了解他们子女在我校学习的情况。
    认真贯彻党的教育方针
    我们暨南大学是一所负有培养归侨学生和港澳学生任务的综合大学。自从1958年秋天创办以来，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在党的不断关怀与指引下，坚持党的教育方针，深入展开教育革命，取得不少的成绩，她也像祖国持续全面跃进的形势一样，在飞速地发展着，现在，我校已有了矿冶、水产、航海、数学、物理、化学、中文、历史、经济等九个系，十八个专业，一个预科，本年度共有学生一千七百多人，其中有侨生九百多人，占全校学生总数50％以上。
    我们的党和祖国，对侨生的教育一向是关怀的、重视的，最近，由于印度尼西亚一部分敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的势力，掀起排华的浪潮，华文学校被迫关闭，越来越多的华侨生被迫地和自觉地要求回到祖国求学就业。祖国工农业连续跃进，文化科学和教育事业大发展，需要大量人材从事社会主义的建设，对华侨青年的归国就学就业开拓了广阔的前途。不久即将有大批从印尼归国的侨生进到我校学习。我校在开设课程方面、在生活条件方面，作了积极的安排；全校员生热烈欢迎归国侨生的到来。因此，对侨生的教育就更形重要，我校所负的责任也就格外重大。
    由于侨生大部分时间，生长在资本主义国家，或帝国主义的殖民地，遭受着数重压迫的痛苦，具有民族解放与民主革命的思想，倾向进步，对社会主义思想，经过学习后，也能很好地接受。另一方面，由于社会主义祖国日益强大，国际威信和地位越来越高，因而他们的爱国主义思想也比过去任何时期更加强烈，他们对祖国的繁荣富强感到无限振奋，爱国主义的思想就成为他们学习、工作和追求进步的一股经常起作用的动力之一。
    侨生们回国后在学校里面，一般说来，学习努力，工作热情，能服从领导，尊敬老师，待人接物态度和蔼，对新鲜事物容易接受，不甘落后，迫切要求进步，他们希望和国内学生一视同仁，不要求特殊照顾，生活多样化，生动活泼；绝大多数同学经过短期补习后，无论文化上政治上都能迅速跟上国内同学水平，他们的进步都很快。所有这些都是侨生们积极的一面。
    但由于侨生们回国不久，长期处在海外，受资产阶级教育的熏陶，不同程度上受到了资产阶级思想的影响，存在着不同程度的资产阶级个人主义思想，兼以在海外或多或少地受到了帝国主义和反动派宣传的影响，有些人对社会主义祖国的了解不深，对党对社会主义的认识还是模糊的。当然这是消极的一面，这是由于以往所处客观环境所造成的，是不足为怪的，只要加强领导，加强教育，他们的缺点是可以克服的。
    我们认为在学校里，只要大力地加强党的领导，以毛泽东思想为指南，坚持群众路线，贯彻党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，并贯彻对华侨同学“一视同仁、适当照顾”和“放手锻炼，加强教育，照顾特点”的原则，善于运用鼓励，表扬为主，耐心教育，亲切关怀的办法，发扬积极的一面，克服消极的一面，一定能够加速对他们的教育和帮助他们加速成长，使他们更好地为社会主义建设服务。我校一年多来，特别是反右倾、鼓干劲的社会主义教育运动以来，对侨生教育所取得的成绩，就是有力的证明。
    思想、教学和劳动三丰收
    一学年来，我校在祖国社会主义建设继续大跃进的形势下，在省委高校党委直接领导下，在中央侨委与广东省侨委的关怀下，去年下半年在“以反右倾整风运动为纲，带动全面工作跃进”的方针指导下，全校各方面的工作出了一个继续跃进的局面，取得了明显的成绩，做到了运动、教学（科研）、生产劳动三不误，从而取得了政治思想、教学（科研）、生产劳动三丰收。
    通过思想教育，侨生的爱国主义和集体主义思想普遍高涨
    党像园丁爱护幼苗一样辛勤地培养着我们的华侨同学，随时随刻地关怀着他们的成长，党的教育使他们从原来的民主主义思想，向社会主义、共产主义思想大大地跨进了一步，侨生们政治思想面貌起了根本的、质的变化。他们学习了党的八届八中全会文件后，看到学校党委领导同志带头认真严肃地检查自己的某些错误思想，对祖国对人民表现了高度的负责精神，不少侨生感动得流泪说：“党委那怕是点滴的缺点都对我们讲了，几十年的老干部都深刻地检查自己的错误思想，影响我们的那些腐朽的资产阶级思想，有什么可以值得保留的呢？”在校党委领导下侨生们立即掀起了一个声势浩大、广泛深刻的社会主义教育运动，纷纷贴出大字报或在小组会上检查和批判自己的资产阶级个人主义思想，例如历史系陈中平同学回国前，他父亲曾拿出三十年前出国时的破衣烂袄对他说：“我从前是这样出国的，你们现在是幸福极了，回国后要认真学习，千万不能辜负政府的教育和期望。”可是，他回国后，生活自由散漫、大吃大喝，学习不努力。在这次学习中，当他回忆起父亲临别叮嘱时，泣不成声，他批判了自己的忘本思想；现在工作很积极，学习成绩优良，劳动被评为突击手。他万分感慨地说：“我们归侨学生只有听党的话，坚决跟着党走，严格要求自己，才有光明的前途”，他的一言道破了侨生们的心里话。
    在这次社会主义教育运动中，由于同学们觉悟提高了，暴露出来有个别侨生想回到海外去，经过社会主义教育向党表示决心说“我是中国人，我要为祖国的人民服务，就是死也要死在中国。”祖国工业、农业和文化教育飞速发展，使侨胞有了强大的靠山，再也不是海外的孤儿；然而毕竟还是过着离乡背井、漂泊海外的生活，深受寄人篱下之苦。归侨学生回到了祖国，才像投到亲娘的怀抱中那样感到了温暖和幸福。他们说：“资本主义社会把我们从人变成鬼，社会主义的祖国把我们从鬼变成人。”他们深深地爱上了党，爱上了强大的社会主义祖国，爱上了劳动人民。在去年洪水侵袭的时候，侨生们纷纷地要求参加防洪抢险到战斗的最前线去，未被批准，他们又积极地捐献物资数达八千多件支援受灾人民。这具体地表现了侨生们爱国主义和共产主义思想的不断增长，在党的教育和培养下阶级友爱、集体主义精神逐步地树立起来，互相学习、互相帮助的气氛在我校普遍形成。冬天个别工农同学被不够暖，华侨同学就热情地把自己的被子让出来，女同学给男同学缀补衣服，在下放期间，工农同学帮助体弱的同学挑行李……等例子数不胜数。同学们批判了资产阶级个人主义思想，树立了爱护集体、争取集体荣誉的共产主义思想。如水产系一年级养殖专业一班就是一个典例，该班共有四十五人，其中侨生三十二人，占全班学生总数71.1％，女同学占多数，开始时不少同学不热爱专业，认为养鱼是丢人的事，政治气氛薄弱，学习纪律很差，劳动、团结都搞不好，尤其是男女同学之间互不理睬、互相趋避，但在社会主义教育运动中，他们受到了深刻的教育，树立强烈的集体荣誉感。该班从根本上改变了过去的落后面貌，全班空前团结一致，变为全校红旗班，学习上发挥了互助精神，保证了全班95.5％达优良成绩，百分之百参加了科研活动，在挖“明湖”劳动中三天半时间完成了一周的任务，被评为全校先进突击队，全校第一名文艺先进班，该班团支部也评为全校第一名红旗支部。
    通过劳动锻炼，培养了华侨学生的劳动观点和劳动习惯
    劳动锻炼大大地提高了侨生们的阶级感情，劳动观点和劳动习惯，他们深深地体会到只有通过劳动锻炼，跟工农同学打成一片，才能进行认真的改造，脱胎换骨，成为社会主义的建设者。去年冬天侨生们为了表示欢迎省委第一书记陶铸同志兼任我校校长，表示感谢党对归侨学生莫大的关怀，和全校师生一起投入了修建“明湖”的战斗，提前了一个月完成了宽达二十四亩的人工湖工程，为国家节约了三万一千多元。许多回国不久的，和一部分身体弱的同学，领导上照顾他们，不让他们参加较费力的劳动，可是他们刚刚被动员回去，转眼间又出现在工地上。在“明湖”建成庆功大会上有30％侨生被评为光荣的劳动突击手。有人担心，华侨同学参加劳动会累坏身体，从无数的事实说明这种担心是多余的，没有根据的。就以我校黄裕珠同学来说，回国后参加了全民炼钢运动，劳动使她身体更结实了，体重增加了八斤，在团组织的教育培养下最近光荣地参加了共青团，但是她在海外的母亲总以为她一定瘦得不成样子，来信叫她回印度尼西亚，后来看到黄裕珠同学寄回的照片，又惊奇又高兴，她不仅放下了心，最近还送黄裕珠的弟弟归国来考大学。
    侨生们那一颗已经进步了的、火热的心都向着一个目标——为建设强大的社会主义祖国而努力，纷纷要求召开全校“华侨、港澳同学跃进誓师大会”，会上全体侨生在毛泽东的光辉旗帜下发出了战斗的誓言“要永远听党的话，永远跟着党走，下决心学习工农同学那种大公无私、艰苦朴素、刻苦钻研、忘我工作的高尚品质。大会选出了五十八位优秀的华侨、港澳生，受到大会的表扬，成为全校的标兵。会后他们响应了党的号召，掀起了学习毛泽东思想的高潮，普遍成立了毛泽东思想学习小组，在他们的积极带动下，外国籍同学也主动地要求参加毛泽东思想学习，毛泽东思想照耀了每一个侨生，如侨生林汉忠说：“学了毛主席的著作，思想受到鼓舞，懒汉思想得到了克服”，目前他们正以毛泽东思想为指南，结合本身存在的问题，大写特写心得、读后感和论文。通过学习提高了思想认识，在他们中间已普遍出现了二少——上街少、思想问题少；五多——订报刊多、看书多、争取社会工作的多、要求入党入团多、写文章多的好现象。他们政治上迫切要求进步，一年来已经有七十位华侨同学参加了共青团，中文系二年级和水产系一年级百分之百的侨生申请入团。
    上述一切都充分地说明了在党的培养教育下，我校侨生政治思想上有了一个大大的飞跃。在这次印度尼西亚排华、反华浪潮出现的时候，当他们座谈陈外长建议的时候，纷纷揭露排华事件的真象和美帝国主义的阴谋，并对印度尼西亚一部分敌视中国和印度尼西亚友好的势力所掀起的无理的反华排华的行为感到无比愤怒，他们表示决心加强团结，为祖国社会主义建设，而刻苦钻研，努力学习，积极参加劳动锻炼，把自己加速培养成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子，为社会主义事业贡献一切力量。并以实际行动拥护国务院关于接待和安置归国侨生的指示，让出好的宿舍和课室，表示热烈欢迎最近回国的侨生来我校学习。
    巩固了专业思想，端正了学习态度，明确了学习目的，侨生学习积极性大大提高
    随着整风运动的伟大胜利，随着毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，随着党的教育方针的贯彻与教育革命深入，随着侨生们政治思想水平的大大提高，批判了学习动机上的个人主义，同学们从以前认为暨大是新办学校条件比不上老大学，牌子新，不合理想而转到爱上了暨大，舍不得离开暨大，从不安心学习专业到热爱专业，端正了学习态度，明确了学习目的，独立思考与集体互助的学习蔚成风气，学习积极性大大提高，学习方法不断在改进，创造性的教和学已经收到显著成绩，如历史系二年级俄语课，在老师和同学们的共同努力下，创造了课外大量阅读，边学边用（边翻译）以较多的课堂提问，来代替单纯的老师讲授……等方式收到良好效果，教学时间减少了三分之一以上，而学习效果较前大大提高，同学们已经可以单独进行翻译新版“苏共党史”，该班多数同学的俄语已达到俄语专科二年级，或普通大学三年级的水平。其他学科的学习成绩也大大提高，如经济系二十四位侨生学习“经济计算”一课，在社会主义教育运动以前，优良成绩只占74％，不及格的占22％，运动后，提高了思想，鼓足了干劲，百分之一百达到优良成绩，在科研方面过去不少侨生还是门外汉，他们认为一年级学生没有专业知识，根本谈不上什么科研，再则科研本是研究机关的工作，大学低年级生怎么搞科研呢？但思想解放了的侨生现在却不然，在校党委提出了2月红的号召以后，全校师生一致响应，科研大搞群众运动，在短短的二十多天全校就完成了一百五十一项科研项目，归侨学生们百分之百的参加了，献出了他们最大的力量，如中文系赖锡房等二十三位归侨学生，就写出了十五万字的长篇小说，矿冶系侨生和同学们一起在二十多天就做出了高压热电偶，中文系侨生和全系老师同学们一起利用假期到各地调查访问，共同写出了“岭南春色”专集和搜集了不少民歌……等，同学们在3月2日向党报喜大会上大显身手，各献其礼，展出在向党报喜陈列馆里，它表示了我们全校师生在党的领导下团结一致，解放思想，敢想敢干，它集中了我们全校师生的智慧，反映了我们全校师生的成绩，在这里充分地说明了毛泽东思想的胜利，党的教育方针的胜利。侨生们特别喜欢和擅长于文体活动，讲究卫生，很自然的就成为我校文艺体育卫生工作队伍中的骨干。我校文工团曾到广州军区及广州侨生代表大会上演出都获好评。这不仅在于侨生们有此爱好，或者节目别有风味，新鲜诱人，更重要的是他们提高了思想认识以后，依据着社会主义的文艺思想不是一成不变地硬搬海外的歌舞，而是有分析有批判地吸收他人的长处而加以提高。他们并得到了战士歌舞团和华南歌舞团友谊的艺术指导和帮助，创造性地排演了不少具有一定水平的文艺节目。
    对培养华侨学生的体会
    如何把侨生培养成为建设社会主义祖国的人材，根据我们工作的初步摸索，我们认为归国华侨青年和国内青年一样，是能够充分地接受社会主义教育的，我们在教育工作方面努力贯彻党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，就可培养侨生得到全面的发展，将来成为又红又专的人材。不过如上所述，归国侨生由于过去环境和教育的影响，他们才归国时，在政治思想方面，在某些学科的水平方面，都有一些特点。我们从一年多来对侨生的教育工作得到以下三点：
    第一、对侨生教育的政治意义，必须有足够的估计和认识。解放以来，越来越多的侨生回到祖国来学习，他们都有一颗热爱祖国的炽热底心，有参加社会主义建设的宏愿，加强对他们的教育和培养，就可以大大地扩大建设社会主义的知识分子的队伍，而且对团结海外广大的侨胞，对争取世界持久和平与反殖民主义的斗争，都将起着重要的作用。
    应该充分估计与认识对侨生教育的严重政治意义，才能加强我们对党、对祖国以及对侨生、对侨胞教育的责任感，把归侨学生教育作为一件极端重要的政治任务来完成。
    第二、对侨生的特点应有正确的估计，才能针对他们的特点，因势利导，来对他们进行教育。在对侨生的教育中，过去有一部分同志，认为侨生受资产阶级教育的影响较深，社会关系也比较复杂，夸大侨生消极的一面，认为对侨生进行教育比较困难，这种估计和看法是不对的。
    应该指出，由于社会主义祖国越来越强大，社会主义制度优越性日益显著，以及党和政府对侨生所采取的正确方针，就形成为推动侨生进步的强大动力；另一方面，由于侨生们热爱祖国，具有民主革命与反对帝国主义的思想，他们投入祖国的怀抱，就表示他们愿意接受祖国的教育，只要我们善于启发教育，摆事实，讲道理，着重新旧社会的对比，循循善诱，引导他们从民族主义的思想，转到社会主义思想方面来，并在教育的过程中，鲜明地贯穿着这条红线，就一定能够引导他们热爱社会主义的祖国，拥护党的领导，拥护总路线、大跃进和人民公社，把他们培养成为建设社会主义祖国的人材。
    第三、依据“放手锻炼、加强教育、照顾特点”的原则，加强对侨生的教育。
    在对侨生的教育中，如果存在着右倾思想，强调侨生消极的一面，采取迁就的办法，满足他们的不正当要求，用姑息的态度来对待侨生，这样就会阻碍侨生的进步；相反地，我们充分估计到侨生迫切要求进步，有要求与国内学生一同前进的强烈愿望，充分估计他们积极的一面与消极的一面迅速转化的可能，从而放手锻炼，进行正面的教育，就一定能够加速对侨生的教育，多、快、好、省地完成培养侨生的任务。我校自建校以来，坚持党的教育方针，对侨生采取放手锻炼所取得的成绩，也充分证明这一点。
    放手锻炼是加强教育的一面，创校以来，侨生们除与国内学生一起，同学习、同生活、同生产劳动与科学研究外，我们还通过各种参观访问，对侨生进行社会主义教育：通过形势教育，启发侨生认清当前国内外形势，不断提高他们的政治思想水平；通过党委领导、师生结合以及教学、科学研究、生产劳动相结合来贯彻党的教育方针。中央侨委负责同志、中共广东省第一书记兼我校校长陶铸同志对侨生们关怀备至，广东省党政方面其他负责同志，也曾到学校来对侨生作报告和座谈，解决他们思想上和生活上存在的问题，像园丁爱护幼苗一样，对他们无微不至的关怀；召开侨生跃进誓师大会，表扬先进，树立标兵，组成他们自己的先进队伍，来带动其他侨生；学生会设立侨生部，加强侨生自己教育自己。这一系列的做法，大大地加强对侨生的锻炼，也大大地加速了侨生培养的过程。
    在对侨生的教育过程中，在防止右倾思想的同时，也要防止“左”倾的思想，只看到一视同仁，忽视到适当照顾。我们一面对侨生要放手锻炼，另一方面也要照顾他们的特点。他们毕竟回国不久，受祖国的教育时间较短；而且家在海外，相隔很远；在生活习惯上，也还有一些不同之处。因此，在一视同仁，放手锻炼的同时，结合他们的特点，给予适当的照顾与耐心的教育是必要的。校党委和行政对学习上较为困难的侨生加强了个别辅导工作，对侨生的生活，一贯也是关怀照顾的，侨生有病，学校就送他们去疗养院休养，有些老师还亲自为他们煮药；学校对经济困难的侨生，主动发给他们助学金，这次因印度尼西亚反华、排华而经济受到影响的一部分印度尼西亚侨生，校党委和行政了解情况之后，及时予以解决，经常和他们座谈，安定他们的学习情绪。逢年过节，校党委和行政领导，请侨生们到家里一起聚餐和他们去旅行、谈心，并组织内容丰富多彩的文娱晚会，关怀备至。使这些远离亲人的侨生，感到像在自己家里一样温暖。侨生曹祥瑞回想起他父亲在旧暨南大学时，每逢节日就钻到被窝里，挨饥受饿谁也不问一声，再对比今天的生活，格外感到幸福，许多侨生发下了誓言：“听党的话，永远跟着党走”。这样，就推动他们更自觉地学习，更迅速地成长。
    由于我们学校创办不久，经验还不够丰富，对侨生的政治思想教育还得进一步细致深入，找出一些比较成熟的规律；有些侨生的进步还有待巩固下来；有的侨生还进步较慢；个别侨生的消极因素尚未克服。这些缺点，还有待于积累更多的经验，进一步改进工作。希望关心华侨教育的同志们不吝指教，指出我们工作中的疏忽和缺点，使我们能够及时纠正错误，克服缺点，不断改进工作，不断前进，为祖国的社会主义的华侨教育事业献出更大的力量。
