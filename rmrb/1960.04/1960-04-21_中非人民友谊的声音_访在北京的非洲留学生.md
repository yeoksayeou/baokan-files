The friendship between the Chinese and African people is a song that will never end. On the eve of April 15th – “Africa Day”, our reporters interviewed several African students in Beijing. These young descendants of the African people, from various regions of Africa and speaking different languages, all used their personal experiences to praise the close friendship forged between the Chinese and African people in their common struggle. They said: The Chinese people stand with the African people, they are friends, they are brothers.

“I Love China”

In the campus of Peking University, adorned with blooming flowers and green willows, we visited Niopbe, a student from Cameroon, in the international student dormitory. Upon entering his room, the first thing that caught our eye was a Chinese landscape painting and a colorful painting of “Defend World Peace” hanging on the wall. The table was decorated with exquisite Chinese paper silk flowers and other ornaments. All this was so full of Chinese flavor. Niopbe warmly greeted us in Chinese: "How much I love New China!"

Although Niopbe has only lived in China for half a year, this African youth, who has suffered from the brutal trampling of colonialism, has deeply fallen in love with China. He not only decorated his residence with Chinese flavors, but also actively studies Chinese. Niopbe happily told us that he has mastered more than a thousand Chinese words and can conduct simple conversations and read some Chinese books. He picked up a Chinese textbook and opened the lesson “Liu Hulan,” excitedly saying, “There are also many Liu Hulan-style heroines in our country who are fighting for national independence. Some girls, like Liu Hulan, sacrificed their precious lives for independence and freedom.” He paused for a moment and said, "Now, the Chinese people have stood up, and the Cameroonian people will surely achieve complete independence." During the conversation, Niopbe took out an article he wrote, "Thoughts on China." It recorded his beautiful impressions after traveling to Shanghai, Nanjing and other places when he first arrived in China on October 1st last year. These impressions encouraged his belief in striving for national independence.

In Nanjing, Shanghai and other places, Niopbe visited factories and rural people's communes, and contacted hundreds of workers and peasants. The Chinese workers and peasants' soaring enthusiasm for building socialism and their friendly and frank feelings towards their Cameroonian friends moved him greatly. Especially when he learned that before liberation, imperialists erected signs at the entrance of parks in Shanghai stating “Chinese and dogs not allowed,” and now he personally saw the Chinese people becoming masters of their own country, he was even more excited. In his article "Thoughts on China," Niopbe described in detail the prosperity of China and the happiness of its people. At the end of the article, he enthusiastically wrote, "Whoever loves peace, loves justice, and loves freedom cannot but sympathize with China. China is freedom, is labor, is happiness, is friendship, is frankness, is…."

Unforgettable Memory

"I want to thank the Chinese people, thank the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong; their care restored my health!" In the reception room of Peking University, Abdalla, a student from Chad, put his hand on his chest and expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people with excitement.

Twenty-six-year-old Abdalla is as strong as a weightlifter. He only came to Peking University on April 5th to study Chinese. Who would have known that a few days ago he was still a patient at the Asian-African Student Sanatorium? He told us that he came to China for recuperation in October 1959. At that time, he was suffering from lung disease and weighed only sixty-two kilograms, but now he weighs seventy-four kilograms. He pointed to the radiator in the room and said, "Now my body is as strong as that piece of iron." Abdalla gestured with his arms and patted his knees while talking, appearing so lively and happy.

Abdalla said that as soon as he arrived at the Asian-African Student Sanatorium in Beijing, he felt like he was back home, living completely in friendship and happiness. The sanatorium held a welcome party for them, and distributed shirts, jackets, and coats for recuperation. Whether it was the director, doctor, or nurse, everyone was amiable and kind, asking him about his health and taking care of him meticulously. He wasn't used to wearing too many clothes, and the nurse would say, "The weather is hot in Africa, but it's cold here, so you have to be careful!" and advised him to dress warmly. At night, the nurse would gently come to the ward, turn on a flashlight, and help him tuck in his quilt. The doctors treated him carefully day and night, and even the director of the sanatorium often wore a white isolation gown and talked with them in the ward. In the atmosphere of friendship, he quickly recovered his health.

April 5th was the day Abdalla was discharged from the hospital to study at Peking University. When he was about to leave, people repeatedly told him to take care and shook his hand, and he couldn't help but shed tears. During the conversation, Abdalla took out a photo from his pocket. This was a photo given to him by a female nurse when he was discharged from the hospital. On the back of the photo was written: "To my dear African friend - Abdalla, I wish you good health forever!" Signed "Chinese nurse Gu Wenhua." Abdalla said, "The Chinese nurses and Chinese friends at the sanatorium are like my own brothers and sisters!" At the end of the interview, Abdalla said, "The imperialists hoped that we Africans would die, but Chinese friends restored my health. I will never forget the Chinese people in my life!" He also expressed that he must learn Chinese well and strive to promote the friendship between the African people and the Chinese people in the years to come.

Cameroon – China

At Peking University, we also visited Maosong, a student from Cameroon.

When introducing the struggle of the Cameroonian people, Maosong pointed to the Chinese map on the wall and said, "In Cameroon, people think of China as soon as they talk about independence, because China's past is the same as our present fate. Now, the Chinese people have become masters of their own country."

When talking about the atrocities of the colonialists in Cameroon, Maosong couldn't suppress the anger in his heart.

In Cameroon, the French colonialist army committed all kinds of evils, including burning, killing, and raping. They even cruelly gouged out the eyes of Cameroonians and burned people alive together. People could be suspected of having political problems while walking leisurely on the road, arrested, and interrogated severely. Even if no evidence was found, they would be secretly executed. People buying things in the market were often killed by bombs dropped by French planes. People who were sound asleep could suddenly be shot dead by bullets penetrating the walls. It was truly "difficult to move an inch, disaster at any moment." The lives of the Cameroonian people were not guaranteed in any way. Maosong said, "Facing these cruel realities, we clearly see that behind the French colonialists' forced declaration of Cameroon's independence in January this year lies a despicable and shameful conspiracy of deception."

Speaking of this, Maosong's pair of deep and clear eyes gazed into the distance. He said confidently, "Our brothers and sisters are not willing to be enslaved. Under the leadership of the Cameroonian People's Union, the people have joined the battle of liberation, resolutely demanding the expulsion of the French colonial army and striving for the complete independence of their country." He said: "The victory of the Chinese people and the Chinese people's support for our struggle for national independence have given us great encouragement. Our people have a common will, which is to resolutely liberate ourselves from enslavement, and we will soon live in a free and happy world."

The African people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism is like a prairie fire, and this struggle equally excites every African student in China. On the eve of "Africa Day," students from Cameroon, Uganda, Nyasaland and other countries at Peking University wrote articles commemorating "Africa Day," expressing their determination to oppose imperialism and colonialism. The news of the establishment of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association made them feel infinitely excited. They especially mentioned that the 650 million Chinese people and the people of the world support the African people's struggle, which has given them great confidence: The dawn of a new era is rising in Africa, and the African people will surely become the masters of their own land.

    中非人民友谊的声音
    ——访在北京的非洲留学生
    本报记者　汪波清　虞锡珪
    中国和非洲人民的友谊是一支唱不完的歌。4月15日——“非洲日”的前夕，记者在北京访问了几位非洲留学生。这些年青的非洲人民的子弟，来自非洲各个地区，操着不同的语言，但是他们都用亲身经历，同声称颂中、非人民在共同斗争中结成的亲密友谊。他们说：中国人民和非洲人民站在一起，他们是朋友，他们是兄弟。
    “我爱中国”
    在花红柳绿的北京大学校园，我们在留学生宿舍访问了喀麦隆留学生尼奥伯。一走进他的寝室，首先映入眼帘的是挂在墙壁上的中国风景画和“保卫世界和平”的彩色画，桌上摆设着中国手工艺人精心制作的纸绢花和一些装饰品。这一切，多么富有中国的风味。尼奥伯热情地用中国话对我们说：“我是多么热爱新中国啊！”
    虽然，尼奥伯在中国居住还只有半年，可是这个饱受殖民主义者残暴蹂躏的非洲青年，就深深地爱上了中国，他不仅把自己居住的地方布置得具有中国风味，同时积极学习中文。尼奥伯愉快地告诉我们，他已经掌握一千多个中文单字，可以做简单的会话和阅读一些中文书籍。他顺手拿起一本中文课本，翻开“刘胡兰”一课，激动地说：“我们国家里也有许多刘胡兰式的女英雄，她们为争取民族独立战斗着，有的姑娘和刘胡兰一样，为了独立、自由献出了自己宝贵的生命。”他沉默了一会儿说：“现在，中国人民是站起来了，喀麦隆人民也一定会获得完全的独立。”谈话中间，尼奥伯拿出一份他写的文章：“对中国的感想”。这里记载着他在去年10月1日刚到中国时，旅行了上海、南京等地后，留下的美好印象，这些印象鼓舞了他争取民族独立的信念。
    在南京、上海等地，尼奥伯参观了工厂和农村人民公社，接触了上百名工人和农民，中国工农群众建设社会主义的冲天干劲和对喀麦隆朋友的友爱、坦率的感情，使他很激动。特别当他知道解放前，帝国主义在上海的公园门前，竖立着“华人与狗不得入内”的牌子，而他现在亲眼看到的中国人民成了自己国家的主人的时候，他更是心情激动。尼奥伯在他的“对中国的感想”的文章中，详细描述了中国的繁荣和人民的幸福，他在文章的最后热情地写道：“谁爱和平、爱正义、爱自由，谁就不能不同情中国。中国就是自由，就是劳动，就是快乐，就是友谊，就是坦率，就是……。”
    难忘的记忆
    “我要感谢中国人民，感谢中国人民的领袖毛泽东；他们的关怀使我恢复了健康！”在北京大学的会客室里，乍得留学生阿布达拉用手贴着胸口，激动地向我们表达了他对中国人民的感激心情。
    二十六岁的阿布达拉结实得像个举重运动员，他是在4月5日才来到北京大学学习中文的。谁能知道，他在几天以前还是亚非学生疗养院的疗养员呢。他告诉我们，他是在1959年10月间来到中国疗养的，那时他害着肺病，体重只有六十二公斤，现在已经是七十四公斤了。他指着房间的暖气片说：“现在我的身体就和那铁块一样。”阿布达拉谈话时，一会儿伸出胳膊，一会儿拍打着膝盖，显得那么活跃，那么高兴。
    阿布达拉说，他一到北京的亚非学生疗养院，就像回了家，完全生活在友谊和快乐之中。疗养院举办晚会欢迎他们，发了疗养用的衬衣、外衣和大衣，不论是院长、医生或是护士，人人和蔼可亲，向他问寒问暖，照顾得无微不至。他不习惯多穿衣服，护士就说：“你们非洲天气热，我们这里天冷，可要注意！”劝他穿好衣服。晚上，护士轻轻来到病房，打亮手电筒，帮他把被子盖好。医生日日夜夜悉心治疗，就连疗养院的院长也经常穿上白色的隔离衣，到病房和他们谈话。在友谊的气氛中，他很快恢复了健康。
    4月5日是阿布达拉出院到北京大学学习的一天，临离开的时候，人们又是叮嘱，又是握手，他禁不住流下了眼泪。谈话中间，阿布达拉从贴身的口袋内掏出一张照片，这是阿布达拉出院时一个女护士送给他的。照片背面写道：“送给亲爱的非洲朋友——阿布达拉，祝你永远健康！”下署“中国护士顾文华”。阿布达拉说：“疗养院的中国护士和中国朋友，都像我的亲兄弟、亲姐妹一样！”我们在结束访问的时候，阿布达拉说：“帝国主义希望我们非洲人死掉，而中国的朋友却使我恢复了健康，我一生也忘不了中国人民！”他还表示一定要学好中文，在今后的岁月里为增进非洲人民和中国人民的友谊而努力。
    喀麦隆——中国
    在北京大学，我们还访问了喀麦隆留学生茂松。
    茂松在介绍喀麦隆人民的斗争的时候，他指着墙上的中国地图说：“在喀麦隆，人们一谈到独立，就想到中国，因为中国过去和我们现在的命运一样。现在，中国人民已经做了自己国家的主人。”
    谈到殖民主义者在喀麦隆的暴行时，茂松压抑不住心中的愤怒。
    在喀麦隆，法国殖民主义者的军队烧杀、奸淫，无恶不作，甚至残酷地挖掉喀麦隆人的眼珠，把人们赶在一起活活地烧死。人们安闲地走在路上，就有可能被怀疑有政治问题，逮捕起来严刑审讯，找不到任何证据，也要遭到秘密枪决；在市场买东西的人，往往被法国飞机投扔下来的炸弹炸死；正在熟睡的人们，也会突然被穿进墙壁的子弹打死。真是“寸步难行、祸在旦夕”，喀麦隆人民的生命没有任何保障。茂松说：“面对着这些残酷的现实，我们清楚地看到，法国殖民者在今年1月被迫宣布喀麦隆独立的背后，隐藏着卑鄙可耻的欺骗阴谋。”
    说到这里，茂松的一双深沉而清澈的眼睛遥望着远方。他自信地说：“我们的兄弟姐妹们，不甘心被人奴役的命运。在喀麦隆人民联盟的领导下，人民投入了解放的战斗，坚决要求驱逐法国殖民军，争取自己国家的完全独立。”他说：“中国人民的胜利，中国人民对我们争取民族独立斗争的支持，给了我们很大的鼓舞。我国人民有一个共同的意志，就是坚决把自己从奴役中解放出来，我们即将生活在自由幸福的天地里。”
    非洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争势如烈火燎原，这一斗争同样激动着每一个在中国的非洲留学生。“非洲日”前夕，北京大学的喀麦隆、乌干达、尼亚萨兰等国的留学生，都写了纪念“非洲日”的文章，表达了他们坚决反对帝国主义和殖民主义的意志。中国非洲人民友好协会成立的消息，使他们感到无限的兴奋。他们特别提到，六亿五千万中国人民和全世界人民支持非洲人民的斗争，使他们产生了巨大的信心：黎明的曙光正在非洲升起，非洲人民定将成为自己土地的主人。
