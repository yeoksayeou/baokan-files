　　This newspaper's dispatch from Xining on the 1st: The advanced unit attending the National "Heroes Conference"—Qinghai Xining Iron and Steel Plant—has created the province's highest record for the utilization coefficient and daily output of small blast furnaces. From February 25th to March 13th, the average utilization coefficient of this plant's No. 5 three-cubic-meter small blast furnace reached 7.279, the coke ratio was 0.725, and the qualification rate reached 92.1%. In order to enable this small blast furnace to create even newer achievements, the plant's workers carried out technical modifications to the furnace from March 14th to 21st. In the five days from the furnace's reopening on March 21st to the 26th, the output increased even further, with an average daily iron production of over 30 tons, an average utilization coefficient of 10.785, a coke ratio reduced to 0.647, and a qualification rate reaching 94.5%.

　　The reason why this small blast furnace has created such great achievements is due to the fact that under the leadership of the Party organization, the workers have continuously revolutionized their thinking, which has led to continuous technological innovations. In the technical modifications of this small blast furnace, they mainly learned from the advanced experience of "high temperature and strong wind" from small blast furnaces across the country based on specific circumstances. Due to the increase in air volume and the rise in furnace temperature, the smelting time per furnace has been shortened from one and a half hours to one hour, and sometimes even less than one hour.

　　After Xining Iron and Steel Plant's No. 5 three-cubic-meter small blast furnace created the highest record, the iron and steel plants across the province actively learned from its experience. In the first half of March, the average utilization coefficient of the province's three-cubic-meter small blast furnaces reached 3.778, which was a significant increase compared to December of last year and January and February of this year.

　　This newspaper's dispatch from Zhengzhou on the 1st: Workers at Henan Xinxiang No. 2 Steel Plant, in carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, have focused on the technical modifications of small blast furnaces and the weak links such as low ore and coke output and poor quality, enabling pig iron production to complete the state production plan for the first quarter fifteen days ahead of schedule. The daily pig iron output increased by 33.4% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, the average utilization coefficient for the entire quarter was 2.137, an increase of 40% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, the coke ratio dropped to 1.078, and the average qualification rate of pig iron reached over 99%.

　　At the beginning of this year, the workers of Xinxiang No. 2 Steel Plant carried out technical innovations on small blast furnaces. In order to increase the hot air temperature, they continuously carried out three innovations on the hot air stove, expanding the heating area of the hot air stove by two times and increasing the air temperature to above 650 to 700 degrees, thereby increasing the smelting intensity of the blast furnace. The implementation of high air volume and high air temperature operations has ensured a rapid increase in the pig iron production of small blast furnaces.

    西宁五号小高炉职工思想不断革命技术不断革新
    创利用系数10.785最高纪录
    新乡第二钢铁厂小高炉利用系数一再提高
    本报西宁1日电　出席全国“群英会”的先进单位——青海西宁炼铁厂，创造了小高炉利用系数和日产量的全省最高纪录。这个厂的五号三立方米小高炉从2月25日到3月13日的十八天内，平均利用系数已达到七点二七九，焦比为零点七二五，合格率达到92.1％。为了使这座小高炉创造更新的成绩，这个厂的职工从3月14日到21日又对这座小高炉进行了停炉技术改造。3月21日开炉到26日的五天中，产量比以前更加提高，平均每天产铁在三十吨以上，平均利用系数达到十点七八五，焦比下降到零点六四七，合格率达到94.5％。
    这座小高炉所以会创造出这样大的成绩，是由于职工们在党组织领导下，在思想上不断革命，从而在技术上又进行了不断的革新的结果。这个小高炉在进行技术改造中，主要是根据具体情况，学习了全国小高炉“高温大风”的先进经验，由于风量增大、炉温提高，每炉的冶炼时间就由一个半小时缩短为一小时，有时还不到一小时。
    西宁炼铁厂五号三立方米小高炉创造最高纪录以后，全省各炼铁厂积极学习了它的经验，3月上半月，全省三立方米小高炉的平均利用系数高达三点七七八，较去年12月和今年1、2月都有了很大提高。
    本报郑州1日电　河南省新乡第二钢铁厂职工，在开展技术革新和技术革命运动中，大抓小高炉的技术改造和矿石、焦炭产量低、质量差等薄弱环节，使生铁产量提前十五天完成了第一季度的国家生产计划，生铁日产量比去年第四季度增长了33.4％，利用系数全季平均为二点一三七，比去年第四季度提高40％，焦比降到一点零七八，生铁合格率平均达到99％以上。
    今年一开始，新乡第二钢铁厂职工对小高炉就进行了技术革新。为了提高风温，他们连续对热风炉进行了三次革新，使热风炉的受热面积扩大两倍，风温提高到六百五十度到七百度以上，高炉冶炼强度因此也得到提高。由于实行了大风量、高风温操作，保证了小高炉的生铁产量急骤上升。
