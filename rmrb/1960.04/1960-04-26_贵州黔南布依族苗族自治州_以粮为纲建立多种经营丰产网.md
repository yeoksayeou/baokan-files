Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou

Establish a Diversified Management High-Yield Network with Grain as the Key Link

(Our dispatch) The various ethnic group members of the seventy-two people's communes in Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou, have launched a high tide of developing high-yield networks in order to achieve the targets of various crops stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. The whole prefecture takes high-yield dams as the center, high-yield roads as the veins, and connects high-yield dams, high-yield slopes, high-yield ditches, high-yield gardens, high-yield forests, high-yield mountains, and high-yield rivers to form a complete high-yield network with grain as the key link and comprehensive development of diversified management.

At the beginning of the spring plowing and production, while the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture vigorously developed high-yield dams and high-yield slopes mainly for rice and corn, they also established a large number of high-yield gardens for cotton, jute, and vegetables, high-yield forests for oil tea, tung oil, tea, fruit trees, and other economic forests, high-yield mountains for medicinal materials, high-yield dams and high-yield slopes for sugarcane and flue-cured tobacco, and high-yield rivers and high-yield ponds for fish farming... According to incomplete statistics, the area occupied by these high-yield dams, slopes, gardens, forests, and mountains reaches about 40% of the total planted area.

In order to effectively lead this comprehensive high-yield movement, the Qiannan Prefecture Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions at the end of March, requiring party committees at all levels to take high-yield dams as the center and high-yield roads as the veins, connecting high-yield dams, high-yield slopes, high-yield ditches, high-yield gardens, high-yield forests, high-yield mountains, and high-yield rivers to form a complete high-yield network with grain as the key link and comprehensive development of diversified management; it also required party committees at all levels to plant high-yield experimental fields along the high-yield roads, use the high-yield experimental fields to guide the high-yield dams, and use the high-yield dams to drive general fields and low-yield fields, so that the experience of high-yield experimental fields along the high-yield roads can be promptly promoted to the high-yield dams, and the experience of the high-yield dams can be promptly promoted to the general fields; it demanded that "general fields should learn from high-yield dams, and high-yield dams should learn from high-yield experimental fields," to achieve the goal of taking grain as the key link and a comprehensive bumper harvest of various crops. Party committees at all levels and the vast number of commune members rose to the occasion and were in high spirits. Counties and communes immediately took the 1,020,000 mu of food crop high-yield dams as the center, and the Qian-Gui Railway and Qian-Gui Highway, Ce (Heng) San (Jiang) Highway, Ma (Changping) Weng (An) Highway, and other nine longer highways as the trunk lines, and more than 300 simple highways as branch lines, establishing more than 2,200 high-yield roads with a total length of more than 21,000 kilometers, including large car lanes. Along the high-yield roads, there are 70,000 mu of high-yield rice experimental fields and 100,000 mu of high-yield corn experimental fields. Using these high-yield roads as veins, the high-yield dams, slopes, ditches, gardens, forests, mountains, and rivers of various crops in the prefecture are connected to form a complete high-yield network with grain as the key link and comprehensive development of diversified management. Within the area covered by the high-yield roads, counties, people's communes, management districts, and production teams have established high-yield network headquarters and command groups according to the size of the land area under their jurisdiction and the distribution of high-yield dams. There are already 80 headquarters and more than 3,000 command groups at the county and commune levels in the prefecture.

Currently, a large number of laborers on the agricultural front in the prefecture have投入(put themselves) into the movement to fight the high-yield network. According to statistics from April 1st to 4th alone, an average of more than 300,000 laborers per day are accumulating and delivering fertilizer for the high-yield network, and plowing and harrowing the fields.

    贵州黔南布依族苗族自治州
    以粮为纲建立多种经营丰产网
    本报讯　贵州黔南布依族苗族自治州七十二个人民公社的各族社员，为了提前实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的各种农作物的指标，掀起了大搞丰产网的高潮。全州以丰产坝为中心，以丰产路为脉络，把丰产坝、丰产坡、丰产沟、丰产园、丰产林、丰产山、丰产河串联起来，形成了一个以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的完整的丰产网。
    春耕生产一开始，全州各族人民在大搞以水稻、包谷为主的粮食丰产坝、丰产坡的同时，建立了大批棉花、青麻、蔬菜丰产园，油茶、油桐、茶叶、果木和其他经济林木的丰产林，药材丰产山，甘蔗、烤烟丰产坝和丰产坡，养鱼丰产河、丰产塘……等等。根据不完全统计，这些丰产坝、坡、园、林、山所占的面积，达到种植总面积的40％左右。
    为了把这个全面丰产运动切实领导好，中共黔南州委又在3月底发出指示，要求各级党委以丰产坝为中心，以丰产路为脉络，将丰产坝、丰产坡、丰产沟、丰产园、丰产林、丰产山、丰产河串联起来，形成一个以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的完整的丰产网；还要求各级党委在丰产路两旁种植高产试验田，以高产试验田指挥丰产坝，以丰产坝带动一般田和低产田，使丰产路两旁高产试验田的经验，及时推广到丰产坝，丰产坝的经验，及时推广到一般田；要求“一般田向丰产坝看齐，丰产坝向高产试验田看齐”，达到以粮为纲、各种农作物全面大丰收的目的。各级党委和广大社员闻风而起，情绪高涨。各县、各公社即以一百零二万多亩粮食作物丰产坝为中心，以黔桂铁路和黔桂公路、册（亨）三（江）公路、马（场坪）瓮（安）公路等九条较长的公路为干线，三百余条简易公路为支线，建立了包括大车道在内的二千二百多条全长二万一千多公里的丰产路。丰产路两旁有水稻高产试验田七万亩、包谷高产试验田十万亩，以这些丰产路为脉络，把全州各种农作物的丰产坝、坡、沟、园、林、山、河串联起来，形成了一个以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的完整的丰产网。在丰产路过境范围内，各县、各人民公社、各管理区、生产队，以所辖田地面积的大小，丰产坝的分布情况，分别建立了丰产网指挥部、指挥小组，全州县、社一级指挥部已达八十个，指挥小组三千多个。
    现在，全州农业战线大批劳力投入了大战丰产网的运动，仅据4月1日到4日的统计，平均每天有三十多万个劳动力为丰产网积肥送肥，犁耙田土。
