A Party Committee Secretary's Notes

    Ping Diao and Luozi Opera: A Dead Tree Revived
    Zhou Ji, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CCP Handan Municipal Committee, Hebei Province
    We are very excited that the Ping Diao and Luozi Opera Troupe from Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, has been welcomed by the vast audience of the capital during its performances in Beijing.
    Ping Diao and Luozi originated in the Wu'an area of Handan City, Hebei Province, and are now one of the main opera genres in the Handan area. According to legend, Ping Diao originated in the early Ming Dynasty and has a history of hundreds of years. It has more than fifty melodies and twenty-odd rhythms, with rich tunes, complete structure, and beautiful melodies. There are more than two hundred traditional plays. In terms of performance, it has complete roles and detailed division of labor, with unique artistic styles such as lively, healthy, passionate, and bold. Luozi evolved from "flower singing" and has over a hundred traditional programs, such as "Holding Flowers," "Borrowing Hair," and "Running on the Beach," which are all excellent traditional programs of this genre. This genre has distinct characteristics: in terms of plays, the vast majority reflect the lives of farmers, the lyrics are colloquial, and closely combined with the language of the masses; the tunes are beautiful and pleasant, the lyrics are easy to understand, simple, and healthy, and the local flavor is very strong. In terms of performance, it has a vigorous, relaxed, lively, and joyful style, and is full of strong local flavor.
    Before liberation, these two genres were discriminated against by the feudal ruling class. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and Japanese invaders, they also suffered great destruction. Many old artists were displaced and lived without support, and some relied on begging for a living and wandered to their deaths, causing the genre to almost become extinct. During the Anti-Japanese War, Wu'an became an anti-Japanese base area, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, these two genres revived. The Anti-Japanese Democratic Government organized some old artists with lofty patriotic enthusiasm and often performed in the Taihang Mountain base area. During various political movements such as land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, more than a hundred modern plays such as "The White-Haired Girl," "Blood and Tears of Hate," and "Lip and Teeth Dependence" were rehearsed. It made considerable contributions in publicizing the anti-Japanese salvation and organizing the masses to fight against the enemy.
    After the national liberation, especially in the past ten years since the founding of the country, this ancient genre has been rapidly developed and improved. The artists of this genre have completely turned over politically and economically. For example, the old artist Ren Yaohua not only served as the deputy head of the troupe, but also served as a member of the county people's committee. The old artist Wei Hongchang is now the vice president of the Municipal Art Theater, a member of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and has honorably joined the Communist Party. Now, this genre not only has five large professional troupes, but also a large number of amateur troupes. From the perspective of actors, in the past there were very few young actors, and there were no female actors at all, but now, it has a large number of excellent young male and female actors. From the perspective of the scope of performances, it has also expanded from rural areas in Wu'an, Shexian, Cixian, Handan, etc., to provinces such as Henan and Shanxi and large cities such as Beijing and Tianjin.
    The rapid restoration and development of Ping Diao and Luozi is inseparable from the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new." In recent years, the CCP Handan Municipal Committee has conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee on actively cultivating and developing local opera genres. While exploring and supporting other genres, it has focused on cultivating Ping Diao and Luozi. In 1955, the Ping Diao and Luozi Opera Troupe of Wu'an County was transferred to the direct leadership of the Handan Commissioner's Office. In 1956, the CCP Hebei Provincial Committee and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee also focused on cultivating this troupe. The Hebei Provincial Bureau of Culture successively sent more than ten literary and artistic workers, including script writers, directors, musicians, stage artists, and Chen Suzhen, who had artistic talent and development prospects, to work in this troupe, which further enriched the cast. Since then, under the leadership of the Party, the actors, staff, and cadres of this troupe have greatly improved their ideological awareness and were full of energy after going through various political movements such as rectification, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and anti-rightist struggles. Therefore, the artistic level also improved with the improvement of the ideological level. Under the guidance of the Party's policy of walking on two legs, on the one hand, it excavated, sorted out, and performed excellent traditional programs with high ideological and artistic levels such as "Holding Flowers," "Borrowing Hair," and "Two Wolves Mountain"; on the other hand, it created and rehearsed more than a hundred modern plays such as "High Mountain Flowing Water," "Chaoyang Gully," and "Sanliwan" that served politics, production, workers, peasants, and soldiers, and were loved by the people. It cooperated with the political movements of various periods, promoted the development of production, and enriched the cultural life of the people. In 1954 and 1959, it participated in the Hebei Provincial Opera Festival twice, and was warmly welcomed by party and government leaders and participants, and won awards in performance, plays, directing, music, and extras.
    In the past, the vast majority of people were illiterate, but now the cultural level of the vast majority of people has been raised to the junior high school level, which has created convenient conditions for studying politics. On the basis of improving culture and political thought, technical reforms have also been actively and boldly carried out. In the past, it was always believed that Ping Diao could not express modern life, but now, due to breaking superstitions and emancipating the mind, and boldly creating with the spirit of continuous revolution, the large-scale modern play "Red Seeds" has been successfully rehearsed with Ping Diao, which has been well received by the masses. In the past two years, this troupe has carried out seventeen months of performances in mountainous areas and rural areas, performing more than 1,600 performances for four prefectures, sixteen counties, and sixty rural areas; encouraged the revolutionary spirit of the people, and improved work efficiency; at the same time, the soaring enthusiasm and leaping achievements of the masses have also greatly broadened the ideological field of the actors, enriched their lives, and promoted their diligent study and hard work, and improved the ideological and artistic level of the drama.
    Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought on literature and art, although we have made some achievements in supporting local opera genres, there is still a big gap from the requirements of the Party, and it is far from keeping up with the needs of the cultural life of the masses. We must continue to adhere to putting politics in command, follow the mass line well, muster greater revolutionary energy, and move forward courageously on the basis of continued leaps, and push the drama work to a new climax.

### 平调落子枯木逢春

    平调落子枯木逢春
    中共河北省邯郸市委书记处书记　周基
    河北省邯郸专区平调落子剧团这次来京演出，受到首都广大观众的欢迎，我们感到很兴奋。
    平调、落子，发源于河北省邯郸市的武安地区，现在是邯郸地区的主要剧种之一。据传说：平调产生于明代初期，至今已有几百年的历史。它有五十多个曲牌，二十多个板头，曲调丰富，结构完整，旋律优美。传统剧目有二百多个。在表演上，行当齐全，分工较细，具有活泼、健康、激昂、豪放等独特的艺术风格。落子是由“花唱”演变而来，有百余个传统节目，如“端花”、“借髢髢”、“跑沙滩”等，都是这个剧种的优秀传统节目。这个剧种有鲜明的特点：在剧目上，绝大多数是反映农民的生活，唱词口语化，与群众语言紧密结合；唱腔优美动听，剧词通俗易懂，朴实健康，地方色彩非常浓厚。在表演上，富有矫健、轻松、活泼、愉快的风格，并饱含浓厚乡土风味。
    这两个剧种在解放以前，曾受到封建统治阶级的歧视。在国民党和日寇的反动统治下，也曾受到很大的摧残。至使很多老艺人流离失所生活无着，有的靠艺乞讨流浪至死。使这个剧种几乎趋于灭绝。抗日战争期间，武安成了抗日根据地，在共产党的领导下，这两个剧种又枯木逢春。抗日民主政府将一些有崇高爱国热情的老艺人组织了起来，经常在太行山根据地演出。在土改、镇反、抗美援朝等各次政治运动中，排演了“白毛女”、“血泪仇”、
  “唇亡齿寒”等百余出现代剧节目。在宣传抗日救国和组织群众对敌斗争方面，作出了不少的贡献。
    全国解放后，特别是建国十年来，这个古老的剧种，就更得到了迅速发展与提高。这个剧种的艺人在政治上、经济上彻底翻了身。如老艺人任耀华，不仅担任剧团的副团长，还曾任过县人民委员会的委员。老艺人魏洪昌，现任市艺术剧院副院长、省文联委员，并光荣地参加了共产党。现在这个剧种，不仅已有五个大型职业剧团，而且还有广大的业余剧团。从演员来看，过去很少有青年演员，女演员就根本没有，而现在，已拥有大批优秀的青年男女演员。从演出范围上看，也由过去仅在武安、涉县、磁县、邯郸等地的农村活动，扩大到河南、山西等省及北京、天津等大城市。
    平调落子所以如此迅速地得到了恢复和发展，是与党的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针分不开的。几年来，中共邯郸市委认真贯彻执行中央和省委关于积极培植，发展地方剧种的指示，在挖掘与扶植其他剧种的同时，将平调落子作为重点进行培植，在1955年将武安县的平调落子剧团，调归邯郸专员公署直接领导。中共河北省委和河北省人民委员会，在1956年，又对这个剧团进行了重点培养。河北省文化局，先后派了剧本作家、导演、音乐、舞台美术和有艺术造诣发展前途的陈素珍等，十余名文艺工作者到这个剧团工作，这就更加充实了演员阵容。从此，这个剧团的演员、职员、干部，在党的领导下，经过整风、肃反、反右倾等各个政治运动，思想觉悟空前提高，干劲十足。因而，艺术水平也随着思想水平的提高而提高。在党的两条腿走路方针指导下，一面挖掘、整理、演出了思想水平与艺术水平较高的“端花”、“借髢髢”、“两狼山”等优秀传统节目；一面则创编与排演了一百多个为政治、为生产、为工农兵服务的、为人民群众所喜爱的“高山流水”、“朝阳沟”、“三里湾”等现代剧。配合了各个时期的政治运动，促进了生产的发展，丰富了人民群众的文化生活。1954年和1959年，两次参加了河北省戏曲会演，受到党政领导和与会者的热烈欢迎，在演出、剧目、导演、音乐、龙套等方面，都荣获奖励。
    过去绝大部分人员是文盲，现在绝大部分人员的文化水平，已提高到初中程度，由于文化的提高，给学习政治创造了便利条件。在文化与政治思想提高的基础上，在技术上也积极大胆地进行了改革，过去一贯认为平调不能表现现代生活，而现在由于破除迷信，解放思想，以不断革命的精神大胆创造，成功地用平调排演了大型现代剧“红色的种子”，得到群众的好评。这个剧团，两年来进行了十七个月的上山和下乡演出，为四个专区、十六个县、六十个农村演出了一千六百多场；鼓舞了人民群众的革命干劲，提高了工作效率；同时，群众的冲天干劲和跃进的成绩，也大大开阔了演员的思想领域，丰富了生活，促进了他们的勤学苦练，提高了戏剧的思想水平和艺术水平。
    在毛主席文艺思想指导下，我们虽然在扶植地方剧种工作上作出了一点成绩，但与党的要求还有很大距离，还远远跟不上群众文化生活的需要。我们要继续坚持政治挂帅，走好群众路线，鼓足更大的革命干劲，在继续跃进的基础上，勇往直前，把戏剧工作推向更新的高潮。
