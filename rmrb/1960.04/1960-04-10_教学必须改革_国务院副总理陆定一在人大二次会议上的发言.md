Comrades Deputies:

I completely agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin.

Our Great Leap Forward has continued for two years. After completing the original targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, China's industrial and agricultural production is still developing at a leaping pace. The victory of the General Line for Socialist Construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes is a heavy blow to imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionism by the Chinese people. It is a great victory for Marxism-Leninism and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. Imperialists, reactionaries, and modern revisionists, led by Dulles and Yugoslav revisionists, have been maliciously cursing our Great Leap Forward and People's Communes since 1958. In 1959, they developed this curse into a large-scale anti-China, anti-communist movement, saying that we were "aggressors," while American imperialism was "peace-loving." This anti-China, anti-communist movement was nothing more than an attempt to isolate us, create difficulties for us, and undermine our socialist construction. Within the Chinese Communist Party, there were also some right-leaning opportunists acting as their spokesmen, saying that the Great Leap Forward was "not worth the loss" and the People's Communes were "petty-bourgeois fanaticism." Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party thoroughly crushed the rampant attacks of the right-leaning opportunists. The people of the whole country responded to the Party's call with a movement to oppose right-leaning, boost morale, increase production and practice economy. Now, facts have proved the failure of imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionists. Future facts will continue to prove that they will suffer a complete defeat. It is not them who are jubilant, but us, the Chinese people and our friends all over the world. We will never be isolated because what we are doing is in the interests of the people of the whole country and in the interests of the vast majority of mankind in the world.

This year, two new upsurges have emerged in our country. One is the upsurge of technological innovation and technological revolution, which is a national upsurge, unprecedented in scale and speed of progress in our history. The other is the upsurge of rural people's communes increasing and improving canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, and cities vigorously developing people's communes, vigorously developing commune industries, vigorously developing street industries, vigorously developing suburban agriculture, vigorously developing public welfare, and extensively organizing the economic life of residents. This will play an excellent role in increasing production, thoroughly liberating women, improving people's lives, and raising people's communist consciousness.

These two upsurges have raised a series of new questions for those engaged in academic and ideological work and cultural and educational work in our country. Now, the broad masses of workers and peasants demand to study Marxism-Leninism, study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, demand the development of education, culture, health, and sports, demand the development of children's care, and demand further criticism of bourgeois ideology and modern revisionist ideology in all fields of literature and art and academic thought. We should meet these demands. We believe that our academic and ideological workers and cultural and educational workers, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the Central People's Government, will certainly be able to gloriously fulfill their responsibilities. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council have decided to convene a national conference of advanced units and advanced workers in education, culture, health, sports, and other fields in June this year, which will further promote the leap forward in cultural and educational work.

Here I want to talk about one issue: teaching must be reformed.

We want to carry out large-scale experiments starting now, appropriately shortening the duration, appropriately raising the level, appropriately controlling class hours, and appropriately increasing labor in full-time primary and secondary education. We are prepared to gradually and in stages realize the reform of the school system in full-time primary and secondary education over a period of ten to twenty years.

Running our education well is a long-term exploratory process that requires the accumulation of experience. Our guiding ideology is Marxism-Leninism, is Mao Zedong Thought, this is clear. As for how to apply it to education, it will not be solved all at once. China’s education work has made great progress in the past eleven years. Since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council issued instructions on the education revolution in 1958, China’s education has developed rapidly. The quality of teaching, from the three aspects of moral, intellectual, and physical education, has undergone significant changes and improvements. We can now establish such a goal: strive to basically complete the elimination of illiteracy among young and middle-aged workers and peasants and the popularization of primary school education among school-age children during the Second Five-Year Plan period; strive to basically popularize junior middle school education by walking on two legs during the Third Five-Year Plan period; at the same time, vigorously develop senior middle school, secondary specialized, and higher education, establish some accelerated higher vocational schools, and develop various types of spare-time education to cultivate a scientific and technological team that is both red and expert and a theoretical team of Marxism-Leninism for the country. To achieve such a task, great efforts are needed, and it is by no means easy. Despite this, the development of education still cannot meet the needs of all aspects of socialist construction. What is the problem? The problem is that our teaching still has serious problems of being slow, few, poor, and costly, so teaching reform must be carried out.

The current school system in our country was inherited from the Kuomintang rule. This school system was copied from the United States and is a backward school system. The duration of primary and secondary schools is too long, making the popularization and improvement of education difficult. A school system that is too long and of a low level is certainly unfavorable to national construction, to students, and to our future generations. We have carried out teaching reforms before and achieved many results, but we have not had time to reform the primary and secondary school system.

Bourgeois education is of course more progressive than landlord class education, otherwise our country would not have "abolished the imperial examination system and established new schools." However, compared with the educational goals of the working class, the goals of bourgeois education are not only very small, but also have a reactionary side. The goal of bourgeois education is so-called "compulsory education." What is "compulsory education"? That is: on the one hand, using compulsory means to force the working people to receive education, but only allowing them to receive low-level education, not allowing them to receive higher education, only allowing them to have enough knowledge not to damage the capitalists' machines, not allowing them to have the possibility of talking about equality with bourgeois intellectuals in learning; on the other hand, only allowing rich people, people who can not work and not worry about living problems, to have the opportunity to receive higher education, in order to cultivate a group of bourgeois intellectuals to serve the bourgeoisie and rule the working people. Our educational goals are fundamentally different from the goals of the bourgeoisie. We want to realize the popularization and improvement of universal education, realize the great improvement of the communist consciousness and moral qualities of the people of the whole country, and achieve the elimination of the difference between mental and physical labor. This is of course much better and much greater than "compulsory education."

Different classes have different goals, so the principles and methods are also different. We advocate that education serves proletarian politics, while the bourgeoisie advocates "education for education's sake," but in reality, they advocate education for bourgeois politics. We advocate that education must be combined with productive labor, while the bourgeoisie advocates the separation of education from productive labor. We advocate that the education cause should be led by the Party and follow the mass line, while the bourgeoisie advocates that only experts can run schools and that we should follow the expert line. We also advocate using the method of walking on two legs to rapidly develop education, which is also different from the bourgeoisie's advocacy of restricting the development of education.

There are also two different views on teaching issues. We advocate teaching as much, as quickly, as well, and as economically as possible, but bourgeois educators are satisfied with being slow, few, poor, and costly. Dragging out the duration of primary and secondary schools for a long time and lowering the level is beneficial to the bourgeoisie and unfavorable to the working class.

In bourgeois pedagogy, there is a principle called the "principle of ability." The "principle of ability" in bourgeois pedagogy has a correct side, that is, it advocates that students should not be burdened too much and that teaching should be tailored to students' abilities. Our pedagogy should talk about this aspect. However, the "principle of ability" in bourgeois pedagogy has a wrong side, a reactionary side, that is, it does not regard students as people with consciousness and initiative, but as abstract biological people or other animals or plants or "bottles," advocating the "innate theory" that "God (or nature) determines everything," regarding the children of laborers as inferior children; bourgeois pedagogy also advocates that "teachers are servants of nature, not its masters"; therefore, bourgeois pedagogy is full of idealist thought and thoughts against the working people, which we firmly oppose. The "principle of ability" in bourgeois pedagogy defends the slowness, scarcity, poor quality, and high cost of teaching and is used to make it difficult for the working people to receive higher education. Looking at several examples in our country, it is very clear. When the Kuomintang extended the duration of primary and secondary schools from eleven years to twelve years, bourgeois educators did not say that this extension was not in line with the "principle of ability." After the nationwide liberation, although primary and secondary school education has generally made great progress, in terms of cultural level, it has been reduced in some aspects. For example, in mathematics, analytic geometry was removed from the high school curriculum; for example, foreign languages were weakened compared to before. However, this reduction in level has not been opposed by bourgeois educators, and no one has said that it is not in line with the "principle of ability." Now, when we propose that teaching should be more, faster, better, and more economical, the "principle of ability" is used as a theoretical weapon against teaching reform. However, the phenomena of slowness, scarcity, poor quality, and high cost in primary and secondary school teaching are so obvious that they cannot be defended. We fully believe that the vast majority of people in society and in the education sector, 90-odd percent of them, are in favor of teaching reform, and only a very small number of people are opposed to teaching reform. It is impossible to scare us with bourgeois pedagogy.

Since 1958, reformers in education in our country have conducted experiments in various places to reform the school system, reform the content of primary and secondary school curricula, and reform teaching methods. Although the time for this experiment is not long, it can already be seen that teaching reform is practically feasible and not a fantasy.

Now I will give a few examples of experiments.

(1) According to the current system, kindergartens are not allowed to learn to read or do arithmetic. However, experiments in thirteen provinces and cities, including Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Hubei, and Henan, have proved that large classes in kindergartens can learn the Chinese Latin alphabet or recognize eighty to one hundred Chinese characters. Experiments in the five provinces of Heilongjiang, Gansu, Jiangsu, Henan, and Liaoning have proved that large classes in kindergartens can learn arithmetic within twenty. They use games to learn, which not only does not harm children's health, but also makes children and their parents like kindergartens more.

(2) According to the current system, one must be seven years old to enter school. Many places such as Beijing, Jilin, and Gansu have experimented with enrolling children at the age of six, which has been proven to be possible. It seems that children can enter school at the age of six, six and a half, or seven, depending on their development.

(3) From September 1958, the Black Mountain County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Liaoning Province, with the help of the working group of the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, conducted an experiment in language teaching at Beiguan Primary School in the county, using the method of "concentrated learning and concentrated practice." They only spent five weeks teaching the students in the first grade of primary school the first volume of the primary school language textbook issued by the Central Ministry of Education (with 233 new characters). At the end of the first semester, a total of 1,700 new characters were taught to the students. Students recognized an average of 1,115 characters (the best students recognized all 1,700 characters, and the worst students recognized 400 characters), which means that they almost reached the level of the second grade stipulated by the Ministry of Education in one semester (the Ministry of Education's textbooks from the first volume to the fourth volume have a total of 1,230 new characters). Students can also write short essays and keep diaries. This experimental class is now in the second grade. On January 10 this year, Vice Governor Che Xiangchen visited the school, and Liu Yin, a student in this experimental class, wrote a poem: "Uncle Che, you are very busy, watching us study in the classroom, listening to lectures and taking pictures, we will never forget." Please note that this is a poem written by a second-grade student in junior primary school.

From October 1959, Beiguan Primary School in Black Mountain, Liaoning, again used improved methods to teach arithmetic, conducting experiments in two second-grade classes and two first-grade classes, and completed nearly a semester's tasks in nearly a month.

It can be seen that there is much room for improvement in teaching methods and textbooks.

(4) The Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted an experiment of mixed teaching of arithmetic and algebra in two fifth-grade classes of Beijing No. 2 Experimental Primary School, and the results were excellent. In the unified arithmetic examination in Xicheng District of Beijing, the average score of this experimental class was above 94 points. They believe that teaching algebra and arithmetic in a mixed way can lower some of the current middle school textbooks to primary school, thereby promoting the reform of the school system; learning algebra makes it easy for students to solve difficult problems in arithmetic four-rule application problems.

(5) Fifteen provinces and cities, including Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, and Guizhou, are experimenting with a five-year continuous system in primary schools. Because primary schools have been popularized in many places, the previously separated junior primary and senior primary schools have been linked together, and because there is too much repetition in primary school textbooks (for example, arithmetic is repeated as many as seven times: once within ten, once within twenty, once within one hundred, once within one thousand, once within ten thousand, once within one hundred million, and once for integers), it is easy to streamline them, so comrades in charge of education in various places believe that it is not difficult to implement a five-year continuous system in primary schools.

(6) Six provinces, including Jilin, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jiangxi, Henan, and Qinghai, are experimenting with a five-year continuous system in middle schools or a three-two system in middle schools.

(7) Beijing and Henan are experimenting with a ten-year continuous system in primary and secondary schools.

(8) Heilongjiang is experimenting with a nine-year continuous system in primary and secondary schools.

There are many other experiments, which will not be listed.

The experiment of teaching reform requires a long time, and a comprehensive conclusion should not be made too early. However, it can be determined that if teaching methods can be well reformed, textbooks can be adapted, and the Party committee leadership of the school can be strengthened, and great collaboration between teachers can be organized to change the phenomenon of teachers acting on their own and not collaborating with each other, then it is possible to appropriately shorten the duration, appropriately raise the level, appropriately control class hours, and appropriately increase labor. Under the leadership of the Party committee, organizing great collaboration among teachers is very important. The most important courses in full-time primary and secondary schools are language (including Chinese and foreign languages) and mathematics, which are the most basic tools that students must master. If language and mathematics are learned well, it is relatively easy to learn physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography, etc. To enable students to learn language and mathematics well, all teachers must work together. Conversely, language and mathematics teachers also have the responsibility to help students learn physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography, and other courses well. Mutual cooperation under the leadership of the Party committee will achieve twice the result with half the effort. Acting on one's own and not cooperating with each other will be like a plate of loose sand, which will achieve half the result with twice the effort.

Teachers and students of Beijing Normal University, based on their investigation, research, and practical work experience since 1958, have proposed a nine-year continuous system for full-time primary and secondary schools and advocated a fundamental reform of mathematics teaching. The draft of the mathematics teaching plan they drafted was discussed at the conference of the Chinese Mathematical Society, and the mathematicians present unanimously approved the principles proposed in the plan. It is hoped that the Chinese Mathematical Society will cooperate with Beijing Normal University to continue research so that this plan can become as perfect as possible. Beijing Normal University becoming a university of educational revolution is a very good phenomenon. We hope that all higher normal schools will become schools of educational revolution. We hope that all higher polytechnic and agricultural medical schools will become schools of technological revolution. We also hope that higher liberal arts schools will become revolutionary schools in all fields of academic thought, criticizing bourgeois academic thought and developing Marxist-Leninist academic thought in these fields.

Now, provinces and cities are making specific arrangements and conducting large-scale experiments in teaching reform according to their own circumstances. This is still an experiment, but the scale is larger than before. During the experiment, there will certainly be many creations and inventions that will enable teaching to be conducted more, faster, better, and more economically.

Education and teaching must be combined with productive labor. The main purpose of teachers and students participating in labor is to transform their thinking, change the separation of education from productive labor, the separation of education from reality, and change the relationship between intellectuals and workers and peasants. This is a major political and ideological task that must be resolutely implemented. In the past, it was relatively easy for schools in rural areas to participate in labor, but it was more difficult for schools in cities. Due to the development of urban people's commune industries and street industries, the development of suburban agriculture, and the development of collective welfare undertakings, it will be easier for urban primary and secondary school students to participate in productive labor than in the past. In teaching reform, not only should we appropriately shorten the duration and appropriately raise the level, but we should also pay attention to appropriately controlling class hours and appropriately increasing labor. Paying attention to appropriately controlling class hours and appropriately increasing labor will ensure students' health and strengthen labor education, so it is also very important.

Our preliminary idea for the new school system is that the duration of full-time primary and secondary schools can be shortened to about ten years, and the level can be raised to approximately equivalent to the current first year of university. Why do we advocate "about ten years"? Because children enter school at the age of six or seven, and reach the age of sixteen or seventeen in about ten years. Young people at the age of sixteen or seventeen are full laborers. About ten years of full-time education is relatively easy to popularize after the basic construction of farmland is basically completed and agricultural mechanization is realized, because this rarely occupies full labor. It is also possible to implement about ten years of continuous education and raise the level of education to approximately equivalent to the current first year of university. If our preliminary idea can be realized and about ten years of education can be popularized, then in the future, when our young people become full laborers at the age of sixteen or seventeen, everyone will have received about ten years of education and have a knowledge level approximately equivalent to the current first year of university. Our current full-time high school students are all full laborers, so we cannot recruit too many. We currently only have hundreds of thousands of high school graduates every year, and even with more efforts, we can only hope to reach more than one million every year. Trying to have more will occupy too much full labor. However, if we realize the new school system that we have initially envisioned, we can have several million high school graduates every year with high levels and young ages, with little occupation of full labor, because there are several million people in our population who reach the age of sixteen (or seventeen) every year. With so many high school graduates who are at a high level and young, we can implement, in addition to the central, provincial, municipal, and regional governments running institutions of higher learning, each of the more than 1,700 counties in the country can run one or several full-time and part-time institutions of higher learning, and all industrial and mining enterprises, institutions, and people's communes can also run spare-time higher education. We can easily use the method of walking on two legs to enable people over the age of sixteen or seventeen to receive higher education. The future of China's education cause must be so bright and brilliant. In this way, our needs for technical cadres and theoretical cadres will certainly be further met, technological innovation and technological revolution will be accelerated, and the difference between mental and physical labor will be greatly reduced.

This is good for the country and good for individuals. The benefits are very obvious and can be strived for. For the sake of the majority of people, for the sake of society, we must take this path.

Of course, teaching reform is not enough with experiments alone. We also need to prepare various conditions for it in terms of materials and ideology.

First, we must improve the level of teachers. This requires corresponding reforms in normal education and attention to organizing in-service training for existing teachers. Second, we must gradually turn the existing "two-part" schools into full-time schools in batches and then into boarding schools. This requires basic construction. Third, we must run kindergartens well, and for this purpose, we must run nurseries well, which requires greatly developing pre-school normal schools and schools for training childcare nurses. Fourth, we must adopt new educational tools, such as records, audio tapes, slides, movies, radio, television, and fully equip necessary instruments, models, and other new teaching aids. Fifth, there must be a sufficient supply of paper. These are all material conditions.

The main ideological condition is the thorough criticism of bourgeois pedagogy and the development of communist educational theory. We must oppose the slavish style of kowtowing to bourgeois pedagogy, advocate breaking superstitions, liberating our minds, daring to think, speak, and act, and fully mobilizing the masses, the communist style that has been tested in everything. Our educational and psychological research institutions, and higher normal schools, should undertake this work without hesitation.

Our education workers must think about society, about future generations, and about communism, and not just about themselves or their own line of work. We must advocate great cooperation under the leadership of the Party committee, rather than relying solely on individual efforts. During the period of the Northern Warlords and Kuomintang rule, the lives of education workers were precarious. Many people in the education sector were forced to think about themselves due to life pressures, so individualism and sectarianism were very serious in the education sector at that time. In the old society, there were also a few people in the education sector who attempted to make teaching faster and better, but they did not have the leadership of the Communist Party, nor did they receive recognition from the reactionary government, so they could not succeed. Now the situation is fundamentally different. The lives of education workers, like those of other workers, are fully guaranteed. Education work is developing vigorously under the leadership of the Party. Therefore, our education workers can only focus on one thing, thinking about society, thinking about the majority of people, thinking about future generations, and thinking about communism, and strive to carry out teaching reform without any worries. At the same time, the Party and state leading organs must take care of the other end, ensuring the lives of education workers, organizing teachers' in-service training so that they can be competent in their work, and even if there are job transfers, do not reduce wages, and gradually increase collective welfare according to government regulations, and make teachers upgrade in time, and stipulate methods for seniority allowances. For educators who have lost their ability to work due to old age, they should enjoy collective welfare and live their old age happily. The work of teachers is complex mental labor and hard work and should be respected. In the Great Leap Forward of education work, teachers are very busy. The leadership should pay attention to the principle of combining work and rest, ensuring that teachers have sufficient time to prepare lessons, correct homework, and engage in in-service training, and also ensuring that teachers have sufficient rest. Our education work team has undergone ideological transformation and has been supplemented by a large number of new people. The ideological situation is very different and has greatly improved compared to the past. Many advanced workers are full of enthusiasm and high in spirit. However, it is conceivable that there are still a few education workers who may not be able to turn from the old habits of thinking about themselves to thinking about society, and from bourgeois educational ideas to communist educational ideas, all at once. This requires enthusiastic and cordial help. Helping them to transform is the glorious task of the Party and advanced elements in the education sector.

We are walking a road that no one has walked before. We must bravely take this road because we firmly believe that this is the correct road. However, since it is an experiment, although the certainty of success is certain, there will also be local temporary shortcomings. We must even estimate that there may be the possibility of local failures, so we must not act rashly. We advocate that everything be discussed and everything be tested, and advocate that the reform of the primary and secondary school system be realized in stages and in batches over a period of ten to twenty years, and do not rush for success, which is to advocate not acting rashly. New things always have shortcomings when they first appear. If there are shortcomings, they must be corrected, but we cannot deny the benefits of the nine fingers because of the shortcomings of one finger. Our path has been determined. Teaching reform must be carried out. It is not possible not to reform. If there are failures or shortcomings in the experimental process, lessons can be learned, thereby further improving the work, and there is no need to be alarmed. If everyone agrees with this, we will determine it.

Through the education revolution, China’s education cause has been completely renewed and is full of vitality. The teaching reform that we are now carrying out is a continuation of the education revolution. It is still a class struggle, and it also contains the struggle between the advanced and the backward, the correct and the erroneous. Struggle is inevitable, but victory must belong to us. Those who have great ambitions for the realization of communism, those who have great ambitions for the development of the education cause, must unite. We must change the face of "poverty and blankness," surpass Britain in production, and surpass all capitalist countries in education.

We fully believe that through experiments, a new school system, new teaching methods, and new textbooks will emerge from practice, and will gradually be equipped into a new set, forming new theories of education and psychology. Now, we are not in a hurry to stipulate the new national school system in the form of laws and regulations. In the future, after the new school system is stipulated, people should still be allowed to conduct new experiments further. Education and teaching, like other things, are constantly revolutionary. It is conceivable that decades or a hundred years later, some scientific knowledge that seems unattainable now will become common sense for ordinary people, and therefore the content of education must change. The development of social productive forces is endless, the development of science is endless, and the progress of educational thought is also endless. Therefore, even in the future, new experiments must be continuously carried out to continuously reform teaching in order to meet the needs of the development of social productive forces and to eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor.

### 教学必须改革  国务院副总理陆定一在人大二次会议上的发言

专栏：

    教学必须改革
    国务院副总理陆定一在人大二次会议上的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告。
    我们的大跃进，已经持续了两年。在提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的原定指标之后，我国的工农业生产仍然以跃进的速度向前发展。社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、和人民公社的胜利，是中国人民对帝国主义、对反动派、对现代修正主义的沉重打击，是马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。帝国主义、反动派和现代修正主义者，从1958年起，就由杜勒斯和南斯拉夫修正主义者带头，恶毒地咒骂我们的大跃进和人民公社。1959年，他们把这种咒骂发展成为大规模的反华反共运动，说我们是“侵略者”，而美国帝国主义反而是“爱好和平”的。这种反华反共运动，无非是想孤立我们，给我们造成困难，破坏我们的社会主义建设。在中国共产党内部，也有一些右倾机会主义分子做他们的代言人，说什么大跃进是“得不偿失”，人民公社是“小资产阶级的狂热性”。中国共产党在中共中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，彻底粉碎了右倾机会主义分子的猖狂进攻。全国人民，以反右倾、鼓干劲、增产节约的运动来响应党的号召。现在，事实证明了帝国主义、反动派、现代修正主义者的失败。今后的事实，将会继续证明他们要惨败到底。欢欣鼓舞的不是他们，而是我们，是中国人民和我们在全世界的朋友。我们决不会被孤立，因为我们所做的事，是符合全国人民的利益，符合世界人类极大多数人的利益的。
    今年，我国又出现了两个高潮。一个是技术革新和技术革命的高潮，这是一个全民性的高潮，规模之大，进展之速，是我国历史上空前未有的。一个是农村人民公社增办和改进食堂、托儿所、幼儿园，和城市大办人民公社，大办公社工业，大办街道工业，大办郊区农业，大办公共福利，广泛地组织居民的经济生活的高潮。这对于增加生产、彻底解放妇女、改善人民生活、提高人民的共产主义觉悟，都将起极好的作用。
    这两个高潮，对我国从事学术思想工作和文教工作的人，提出了一系列的新问题。现在，广大工农群众要求学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东同志的著作，要求教育事业、文化事业、卫生事业和体育事业的发展，要求儿童保育事业的发展，要求在文艺和学术思想的各个领域中对资产阶级思想和现代修正主义思想作进一步的批判。我们应该满足这些要求。我们相信，我们的学术思想工作者和文教工作者，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，在中央人民政府的领导之下，一定能够光荣地履行自己的责任。中共中央和国务院已经决定，在今年6月召开全国教育和文化、卫生、体育等方面的先进单位和先进工作者代表大会，这将会进一步促进文教工作的跃进。
    这里我要讲一个问题：教学必须改革。
    我们想从现在起，进行规模较大的试验，在全日制的中小学教育中，适当缩短年限，适当提高程度，适当控制学时，适当增加劳动。我们准备以十年至二十年的时间，逐步地分期分批地实现全日制中小学教育的学制改革。
    办好我们的教育，这是一个长期探索的过程，需要经验的积累。我们的指导思想是马克思列宁主义，是毛泽东思想，这是明确的。至于如何运用于教育工作，那就不是一下子就解决的。我国的教育工作，十一年来有很大的进步。1958年中共中央和国务院发出关于教育革命的指示以来，我国的教育事业发展得很快。教学的质量，从德育、智育、体育三方面来看，都有了显著的改变和提高。我们现在已经可以树立这样的奋斗目标：力争在第二个五年计划期间基本上完成在青壮年工农群众中扫除文盲和在学龄儿童中普及小学教育，力争在第三个五年计划期间用两条腿走路的办法基本上普及初中教育，同时大力发展高中、中等专业和高等教育，举办一部分速成的高等专科学校，发展各级各类的业余教育，为国家培养又红又专的科学技术队伍和马克思列宁主义的理论队伍。要实现这样的任务，需要作很大的努力，决不是轻而易举的。虽然如此，教育工作的发展仍旧不能满足社会主义建设各方面的需要。问题何在呢？问题在于：我们的教学还有严重的少慢差费的现象，因此必须进行教学改革。
    我国现行的学制，是从国民党统治时期继承下来的。这个学制是从美国抄来的，是一个落后的学制。中小学的年限太长，教育的普及和提高就困难。学制太长，程度又低，对于国家建设，对于学生，对于我们的后代，当然不利。我们从前进行过教学改革，取得了不少成绩，但是还没有来得及对中小学学制进行改革。
    资产阶级的教育，比起地主阶级的教育来，当然是进步的，否则我国不会“废科举，兴新学”。但是资产阶级教育的目标，同工人阶级的教育目标比较起来，不仅是渺小得很，而且有它反动的一面。资产阶级教育的目标，是所谓“义务教育”。什么叫“义务教育”呢？这就是：一方面，用强迫命令的办法要劳动人民去受教育，但是只让他们受到低级的教育，不让他们受到高等的教育，只让他们有足够的知识不把资本家的机器弄坏，不让他们有可能在学问上同资产阶级知识分子讲平等；另一方面，只让有钱的人，可以不劳动而不愁生活问题的人，能够有机会受到高等教育，以便培养出一批资产阶级知识分子来为资产阶级服务，统治劳动人民。我们的教育目标，同资产阶级的目标根本不同。我们要实现全民教育的普及和提高，实现全国人民共产主义觉悟和道德品质的极大提高，达到消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别。这比之“义务教育”，当然高明得多，伟大得多。
    阶级不同，目标不同，因而方针方法也不同。我们主张教育为无产阶级政治服务，资产阶级主张“为教育而教育”，实际上是主张教育为资产阶级政治服务。我们主张教育必须与生产劳动相结合，资产阶级主张教育与生产劳动分离。我们主张教育事业要由党来领导，走群众路线，资产阶级主张只有专家才能办学，要走专家路线。我们还主张用两条腿走路的办法来迅速发展教育，这与资产阶级限制教育发展的主张也是不同的。
    在教学问题上也是两种主张，我们主张教学要尽可能地多快好省，资产阶级的教育学者却满足于少慢差费。把中小学的年限拖得很长，程度降得很低，这是有利于资产阶级，而不利于工人阶级的。
    资产阶级教育学里，有一条原则，叫做“量力性原则”。资产阶级教育学的“量力性原则”，有对的一面，就是主张不可以使学生负担过重，和主张因材施教。我们的教育学，应该讲到这个方面。但是资产阶级教育学的“量力性原则”有错误的一面，反动的一面，这就是不把学生当作有自觉性、主动性的人看待，而当作抽象的生物的人或其他动物或植物或“瓶子”看待，主张“上帝（或自然）决定一切”的“先天论”，把劳动者的子弟当作劣等儿童看待；资产阶级教育学又主张“教师是自然的仆人，不是它的主宰”；所以，在资产阶级教育学里充满着唯心主义思想和反对劳动人民的思想，这是我们坚决反对的。资产阶级教育学的“量力性原则”，是为教学的少慢差费辩护的，是用来使劳动人民难以受到高等教育的。用我国的几个事例来看，就明白得很。当国民党把中小学学制由十一年延长为十二年的时候，资产阶级教育学家并不说这种延长不合“量力性原则”。全国解放以后，中小学教育虽然总的说来大有进步，但在文化程度上，在某些方面有所降低。例如数学，把解析几何从高中课程中去掉了；再例如外国语文，比从前削弱了。但是，这种降低程度，并没有受到资产阶级教育家的反对，没有人说这是不合“量力性原则”的。现在，当我们提出教学要多快好省的时候，
  “量力性原则”就被搬出来作为反对教学改革的理论武器了。可是，中小学教学中的少慢差费现象实在明显，是无法为之辩护的。我们完全相信，在社会上，以及在教育界里，赞成教学改革的是绝大多数，是百分之九十几的人，只有极少数人才反对教学改革。要想用资产阶级教育学来吓倒我们，是办不到的。
    1958年以来，我国教育工作的革新者，在各地进行了改革学制、改革中小学课程内容和改革教学方法的试验。这种试验的时间虽然不长，然而已经可以看得出，教学改革是实际可行的，并不是一种空想。
    现在我说几个试验的例子。
    （1）依照现行制度，幼儿园不许识字，不许学算术。但是，河北、山西、辽宁、黑龙江、陕西、甘肃、青海、上海、江苏、山东、福建、湖北、河南等十三个省市的试验，都证明幼儿园大班可以学会汉语拉丁拼音，或者识八十到一百个汉字。黑龙江、甘肃、江苏、河南、辽宁五个省的试验，证明幼儿园大班可以学会二十以内的算术。他们用游戏的方式进行学习，不但不会损害儿童的健康，而且使儿童和他们的父母更加喜欢幼儿园了。
    （2）依照现行制度，要七足岁才能入学。北京、吉林、甘肃等许多地方，试验了六足岁入学，证明是可以的。看来，儿童依照发育情况不同，可以六岁入学，或六岁半入学，或七岁入学。
    （3）1958年9月起，中共辽宁省黑山县县委，在中国科学院心理学研究所工作组的帮助之下，在该县北关小学，用“集中学，集中练习”的方法，做语文教学的试验。他们只用了五周时间，就在小学一年级的学生中把中央教育部发行的小学语文课本第一册（有二百三十三个生字）教完了。在第一学期结束时，共教了学生一千七百个生字。学生平均识字一千一百十五个（最好的学生把一千七百字全识了，最差的学生识字四百个），这就是说，一个学期就将近达到教育部规定的二年级的水平（教育部的课本自第一册到第四册共有生字一千二百三十个），学生并能作短文，记日记。这个试验班，现在是二年级了。今年1月10日，车向忱副省长前往该校参观，这个试验班的学生刘音，写了一首诗：“车伯伯，忙又忙，看我们学习上课堂，又听讲课又照像，我们总也不会忘。”请注意，这是初小二年级学生写的诗。
    1959年10月起，辽宁黑山北关小学又用改进的方法教算术，在二年级两个班和一年级两个班进行试验，用了将近一个月的时间完成了将近一个学期的任务。
    由此可见，教学方法和教科书，大有改进的余地。
    （4）中国科学院心理学研究所，在北京第二实验小学五年级两个班内，进行了混合讲授算术和代数的试验，成绩优良。在北京西城区的算术统一考试中，这个实验班的平均成绩在九十四分以上。他们认为：混合教代数与算术，可以使现在中学的某些教材下放到小学，从而促进学制的改革；学了代数，学生就很容易解决算术四则应用题中的难题。
    （5）试验小学五年一贯制的，有河北、山西、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、陕西、甘肃、青海、上海、江苏、安徽、江西、湖北、河南、贵州等十五个省市。由于许多地方小学已经普及，从前分开的初小和高小已经联在一起，又因为小学教材重复太多（例如算术，竟重复到七次之多：十以内一次，二十以内一次，一百以内一次，一千以内一次，一万以内一次，一亿以内一次，整数一次），容易精简，所以各地管教育的同志认为，实行小学五年一贯制是并不困难的。
    （6）试验中学五年一贯制，或中学三二制的，有吉林、陕西、甘肃、江西、河南、青海等六个省。
    （7）试验中小学十年一贯制的，有北京、河南。
    （8）试验中小学九年一贯制的，有黑龙江。
    还有许多试验，不列举了。
    教学改革的试验，需要较长时间，不应该过早作出全面的结论。但是可以断定，如果能够很好地改革教学方法，改编课本，再加上加强学校的党委领导，组织教师之间的大协作，改变教师各自为政、互不协作的现象，那末，适当缩短年限，适当提高程度，适当控制学时，适当增加劳动，是可以实现的。在党委领导之下，组织教师的大协作，是非常重要的。全日制中小学的最主要的课程，是语文（包括中文和外国文）和数学，这是学生所必需掌握的最基本的工具。语文和数学学得好，学物理、化学、生物、历史、地理等就比较容易。要使学生学好语文和数学，必须所有的教师一起努力，反过来，语文和数学的教师也有责任帮助学生学好物理、化学、生物、历史、地理等课程。在党委领导下互相协作，就能事半功倍，各自为政、互不协作，一盘散沙，将是事倍功半。
    北京师范大学的师生，根据1958年以来的调查研究和实际工作经验，提出了一个全日制中小学九年一贯制的方案，并且主张对数学教学进行根本性的改革。他们所拟的数学教学方案的草案，在中国数学学会的大会上讨论了，到会的数学家，一致赞成这个方案所提出的原则。希望中国数学学会同北京师大合作，继续研究，使这个方案成为尽可能完善的方案。北京师范大学成为教育革命的大学，这是很好的现象。我们希望一切高等师范学校，都成为教育革命的学校。我们希望一切理工农医的高等学校，都成为技术革命的学校。我们也希望文科的高等学校，都成为学术思想各个领域的革命学校，在这些领域中批判资产阶级的学术思想，发展马克思列宁主义的学术思想。
    现在，各省市正在依照自己的情况，做具体安排，进行较大规模的教学改革的试验。这仍是试验，但是规模比从前更大。在试验的期间，一定还有很多创造发明，使教学能进行得又多又快又好又省。
    教育和教学，必须同生产劳动结合起来。学校师生参加劳动，主要的目的，是改造思想，改变教育与生产劳动分离、教育与实际脱节的情况，改变知识分子与工农之间的关系。这是一件重大的政治思想工作，必须坚决实行。过去，农村里的学校，参加劳动比较容易，城市里的学校就比较困难。由于城市人民公社工业和街道工业的发展，郊区农业的发展，集体福利事业的发展，城市中小学学生参加生产劳动将会比过去容易了。在教学改革中，不但适当缩短年限、适当提高程度是办得到的，而且也应注意适当控制学时，适当增加劳动。注意了适当控制学时和适当增加劳动，学生的健康就有保证，劳动教育也可以加强，所以也是很重要的。
    我们对新学制的初步设想，是全日制中小学的年限能够缩短到十年左右，程度能够提高到大约相当于现在的大学一年级。为什么我们主张“十年左右”？因为儿童从六七岁入学，到十六七岁，是十年左右的时间。青年到十六七岁就是全劳动力了。十年左右的全日制教育，在农田基本建设大体完成和农业机械化实现后，是比较容易普及的，因为这很少占用全劳动力。实行十年左右的一贯制的教育，把教育的程度提高到大约相当于现在的大学一年级，也是可以实现的。如果我们的这个初步设想能够实现，能够普及十年左右的教育，那末，将来我国的青年，在十六七岁成为全劳动力的时候，人人都能受过十年左右的教育，都有大约相当于现在大学一年级的知识水平。我们现在的全日制高中学生，都是全劳动力，因而不能招得过多。我们现在每年只有高中毕业生几十万人，再加努力也只能希望每年达到一百多万人，要想再多就会过多地占用全劳动力。但是，如果实现了我们所初步设想的新学制，我们就可以在很少占用全劳动力的条件下，每年有高中毕业生一千几百万人，因为我国人口中，每年达到十六岁（或十七岁）这个年龄的是一千几百万人。有了这样多的程度又高年纪又轻的高中毕业生，我们就可以实行除了中央、省市和专区办高等学校以外，全国一千七百多个县每个县都办起一所或几所全日制和半日制的高等学校来，所有的工矿企业、机关、人民公社也办起业余高等教育来。我们就容易用两条腿走路的办法使十六七岁以上的人都受到高等教育。我国教育事业的前途，一定是如此光明灿烂的。这样，我们对技术干部和理论干部的需要，必定能够进一步地得到满足，技术革新和技术革命还要加速向前发展，而脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别将大大缩小。
    这对国家是好的，对个人也是好的。好处非常明显，而且可以力争办到。为大多数人着想，为社会着想，我们一定要走这条路。
    当然，教学改革，光有试验，还是不够的，还要给它准备物质上和思想上的各种条件。
    第一，必须提高教师的水平，这就要对师范教育进行相应的改革，和注意组织现有教师的进修。第二，必须把现有的“二部制”的学校逐步地分批地变成全日制的，然后再变为寄宿的学校，这就要进行基本建设。第三，必须办好幼儿园，为此又必须办好托儿所，这就要大大发展幼儿师范学校和训练保育护士的学校。第四，必须采用新的教育工具，如唱片、录音带、幻灯、电影、广播、电视，以及充分配备必要的仪器、模型等新式教具。第五，要有充分的纸张供应。以上都是物质条件。
    思想条件，主要的是对资产阶级教育学的彻底批判，和共产主义教育理论的发展。必须反对拜倒在资产阶级教育学面前的那种奴才作风，提倡破除迷信，解放思想，敢想敢说敢做，充分发动群众，一切经过试验的共产主义风格。这件工作，我们的教育学、心理学的研究机关，和高等师范学校，应当义不容辞地担当起来。 　 我们的教育工作人员，要为社会着想，为后代着想，为共产主义着想，而不要光为个人着想，光为自己的一行一业着想。要提倡在党委领导下的大协作，而不是光靠单干。在北洋军阀和国民党统治的时期中，教育工作人员的生活朝不保夕，教育界中的许多人为生活所迫，要为自己着想，所以在当时的教育界里，个人主义、门户之见是很严重的。旧社会里，教育界中也有少数人企图把教学进行得快一点好一点，但他们既没有共产党的领导，又得不到反动政府的承认，所以不能成功。现在情况根本不同了，教育工作人员的生活，像其他工作人员一样，是完全有保证的。教育工作有了党的领导，正在蒸蒸日上地发展。因此，我们的教育工作人员，就可以只顾一头，为社会着想，为大多数人着想，为后代着想，为共产主义着想，努力进行教学改革，而无后顾之忧。同时，党和国家领导机关要把另外一头包下来，要保证教育工作人员的生活，要组织教师的进修，使他们能胜任自己的工作，即使发生调动工作的情况，也不要减低工资，而且要依照政府规定，逐步增加集体福利，和使教师适时升级，并规定出工龄津贴的办法。对于因为年老而失去工作能力的教育工作者，应该使他们享受集体福利，愉快地过晚年的生活。教师的工作，是复杂的脑力劳动，是辛苦的工作，应当受到尊敬。在教育工作的大跃进中，教师的工作很忙，领导上应该注意劳逸结合的原则，保证教师有足够的时间来备课、修改作业和从事进修，还要保证教师有足够的休息。我们的教育工作队伍，经过思想改造，和补充了大批新人，思想情况已同过去大有不同，大有进步。许多先进工作者干劲冲天，意志昂扬。但是，可以设想，还有少数教育工作人员，从为自己着想的老习惯，转到为社会着想，从资产阶级教育思想转到共产主义的教育思想，可能一下子转不过来。这就需要热心的亲切的帮助。帮助他们转变过来，这是党和教育界先进分子的光荣任务。
    我们是在走一条前人所没有走过的道路。我们要勇敢地走这条道路，因为我们坚决相信这是正确的道路。但是，既然是试验，虽然成功的把握是肯定的，也会有局部的暂时的缺点，甚至要估计到会有局部失败的可能，所以决不许可轻率从事。我们主张一切经过讨论，一切经过试验，主张以十年至二十年的时间分期分批地实现中小学的学制改革，而不要急于求成，就是主张不要轻率从事。新事物在开始出现的时候总是有缺点的。有了缺点就要改正，但是不能因为有了一个指头的缺点，就否认了九个指头的好处。我们的道路是走定了，必须进行教学改革，不改革是不行的。如果在试验过程中有了失败，有了缺点，可以得到教训，从而更加改进工作，无须大惊小怪。这一点，如果大家同意，我们就确定下来。
    经过教育革命，我国的教育事业已经面貌一新，生气蓬勃。我们现在所要进行的教学改革，是教育革命的继续，依然是一场阶级斗争，同时也包含着先进与落后、正确与谬误的斗争。斗争是不可免的，但胜利一定属于我们。对共产主义的实现有雄心大志的人，对教育事业的发展有雄心大志的人，都要团结起来。我们一定要改变“一穷二白”的面貌，在生产上超过英国，在教育事业上超过一切资本主义国家。
    我们完全相信，经过试验，新的学制，新的教学法，新的教科书，将从实践中产生出来，并逐渐配成新的一套，形成新的教育学和心理学的理论。现在，我们还不忙用法令的形式来规定全国的新学制。将来，在新的学制规定了之后，应当还让人们进一步进行新的试验。教育和教学，同其他事物一样，是不断革命的。可以设想，几十年或一百年之后，现在看来似乎高不可攀的某些科学知识，将成为普通人的常识，因而教育内容必定会改变。社会生产力的发展无止境，科学的发展无止境，教育思想的进步也无止境。所以就在将来，也必须继续不断地进行新的试验，以求不断地改革教学，来适合社会生产力发展的需要，来做到消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别。
