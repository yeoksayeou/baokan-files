Local Newspaper Commentary:

    The technical innovation and technical revolution movement, in itself, includes two aspects: major innovation and widespread promotion. Major innovation and widespread promotion are interconnected and interdependent. Innovation is the basis of promotion, and promotion is the development of innovation. Innovate and then promote, promote and then innovate again, innovation promotes promotion, and promotion promotes innovation. This is the process by which the technical innovation and technical revolution movement develops from low to high, from point to surface, from simple to complex, constantly developing and constantly improving. This is true for the whole country, the whole province, and also within an industry, a region, and an enterprise. Therefore, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we must learn to grasp with both hands: one hand grasping innovation, and the other grasping promotion. Only grasping innovation without grasping promotion cannot truly achieve large-scale innovation and large-scale harvest; conversely, only grasping promotion without grasping innovation would have nothing to promote.
    Another significant characteristic of the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement is its close integration with production and construction, achieving double harvests of innovation and production. This means that the measure of the innovation achievements of an enterprise, a region, or a department is not simply based on how much innovation has been done, but mainly on how much the variety of products has increased, how much labor efficiency has improved, how much production capacity has increased, and how much labor force has been reduced. To achieve these, it is also necessary to attach great importance to the promotion of advanced experiences. Only innovation without promotion cannot guarantee the completion and over-completion of production tasks. Therefore, the key to whether innovation and production are well integrated lies in promotion. As long as we innovate and promote simultaneously, we will definitely be able to achieve continuous technical innovation and continuous improvement in production.

### 一手抓革新一手抓推广

    一手抓革新一手抓推广
    技术革新和技术革命运动，就其本身来讲，就包括两个方面，一个是大革新，一个是大推广。大革新与大推广，是互相联系，互相依存的。革新是推广的基础，推广是革新的发展。革新了就推广，推广中再革新，革新促推广，推广促革新，这就是技术革新和技术革命运动由低到高，由点到面，由简到繁，不断发展，不断提高的过程。全国如此，全省如此，在一个产业，一个地区和一个企业内也是如此。所以在技术革新和技术革命运动中，都要学会两手抓：一手抓革新，一手抓推广。只抓革新不抓推广，便不能真正做到大面积革新，大面积丰收；相反地只抓推广不抓革新，也就无从推广。
    当前技术革新和技术革命运动的另一个显著特点，是与生产和建设紧密结合，革新、生产双丰收。这就是说：衡量一个企业、一个地区或一个部门的革新成果，不单纯是看革新了多少，而主要是看产品的品种增加了多少，劳动效率提高了多少，生产能力增加了多少，劳动力减少了多少。要做到这些，也必须十分重视推广先进经验。只革新不推广，是不能保证生产任务的完成与超额完成的。因此，革新与生产结合得好不好的关键在于推广。只要做到边革新边推广便一定能做到技术不断革新，生产不断提高。
