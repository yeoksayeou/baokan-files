Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, April 11th: The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference opened grandly in Conakry on the morning of April 11th.

Nearly three hundred representatives from Asian and African countries attended the conference, which was held in the Guinean Democratic Party Conference Hall. The flags of Asian and African countries fluttered in the wind at the entrance of the conference hall.

On the podium in the conference hall hung the conference emblem: a map of Asia and Africa with two hands clasped tightly together, with a burning torch in the middle. Banners hung on the walls on both sides, reading: "Strengthen Asian-African Solidarity and Completely Eradicate Imperialism and Colonialism!"

The conference agenda included: completely eradicating imperialism and colonialism in Asia and Africa; economic development issues in the Asian-African region; cultural and social development issues in the Asian-African region; and the Asian-African solidarity movement.

Before the conference began, representatives wearing various national costumes enthusiastically cheered and embraced each other, congratulating each other on the achievements made in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

The conference chairman, Guinean Minister of Public Works, Ismael Touré, declared the conference open amidst applause and cheers.

Guinean President Sékou Touré delivered the opening speech, saying: The decision of the Asian and African peoples to hold the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Guinea demonstrates their determination to take joint action to achieve our common political and economic aspirations and to have our legitimate human demands met.

He said that the people and government of Guinea entrusted him to express their fraternal gratitude and reiterate their determination to continue to consciously and faithfully strive for our common aspiration for freedom, peace and democratic progress.

Referring to the historic Bandung Conference, he pointed out that this conference showed that the answer of the Asian and African peoples to the evil plots of the imperialists is: the will to fight for liberation, and the determination to completely eradicate all forms of oppression and exploitation, and to completely eradicate all roots and residual influences of foreign rule.

Sékou Touré said that imperialism is using all kinds of political, economic, financial, or military means to plunder the inestimable human and material resources of our countries. They are still trying to adopt their divide-and-rule tactics. In order to prevent trade unions, political parties, and Asian-African countries from acting in unison in the struggle against imperialism and for freedom, colonial countries are adopting a policy of granting "independence" and controlling it from a distance. This is the new method favored by neo-colonialism. The ultimate goal of neo-colonialism is to continue to subordinate our people under the guise of the "independence" of African countries. He said that we must be vigilant against the divisive and distracting tactics of imperialism. The solidarity of the Asian and African peoples is the best guarantee of our common interests and the most reliable foundation for realizing our aspirations.

He said that those who doubt our ability to participate as nations in building a new world find it difficult to conceal their abominable racism and sense of superiority stemming from the desire to dominate the globe.

He said that the causes of the unrest in the world are racism and aggression; selfishness; and the forces of oppression and exploitation. We cannot but believe that our struggle against imperialism and colonialism is a decisive aspect of the worldwide struggle for peace.

He said that the forces that plunder colonies have used divisive and distracting tactics to achieve their goals of domination and exploitation. Therefore, we must watch with infinite vigilance all actions that may threaten our unity and endanger our solidarity. As long as there are conquered countries and plundered peoples, as long as an inch of our territory is occupied by foreigners, as long as a part of our property is seized by others, our common task is far from complete. We will continue together in our cause for human liberation and social justice.

After President Touré's speech, Youssef El-Sebai, Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, gave a report on the work of the Secretariat.

The head of the Guinean delegation and Chairman of the Conference, Ismael Touré, read a letter to him from the head of the Chinese delegation, Liao Chengzhi, and the deputy heads of the delegation, Liu Ningyi and Burhan, exposing the sabotage activities of the imperialists, who fabricated a "telegram" to the conference in the name of Guo Moruo.

The letter from the Chinese delegation stated: "We have received a fabricated telegram to the conference in the name of Mr. Guo Moruo. This is a complete fabrication out of thin air, one of the imperialists' conspiracies and tricks aimed at undermining this conference and sowing discord among Asian and African countries. The Chinese delegation solemnly denies this forged and slanderous document."

After reading the letter from the Chinese delegation, Ismael Touré thanked the Chinese delegation and warned the imperialists and their agents to behave themselves. He said that we are determined to make the conference a success and will not tolerate any sabotage of the conference. He urged everyone to be vigilant. Touré's speech was greeted with prolonged applause from the representatives.

At the meeting, congratulatory telegrams to the conference from Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Khrushchev, President Sékou Touré of Guinea, President Nasser of the United Arab Republic, Prime Minister Nkrumah of Ghana, and others were read.

    加强亚非团结　彻底铲除帝国主义和殖民主义
    第二届亚非人民团结大会隆重开幕
    杜尔总统指出反殖民主义斗争是维护世界和平的一个决定性的方面  大会主席痛斥帝国主义者捏造郭沫若电报进行挑拨活动的卑鄙阴谋
    新华社科纳克里11日电　第二届亚非人民团结大会11日上午在科纳克里开幕。
    将近三百位亚非国家的代表参加了这次大会。大会是在几内亚民主党会议厅内举行的。亚非各国的国旗在会议厅门口迎风飘扬。
    在会议厅里的讲台上悬挂着大会的会徽：在一幅亚非两洲的地图上，两只手紧紧握在一起，中间有一枝燃烧着的火炬。两边的墙上挂着标语，上面写着：“加强亚非团结，彻底铲除帝国主义和殖民主义！”
    会议议程包括：在亚非两洲彻底铲除帝国主义和殖民主义；亚非地区的经济发展问题；亚非地区的文化和社会发展问题；亚非地区的团结运动。
    在大会开始前，穿着各种民族服装的代表热情欢呼，并且互相拥抱。他们互相祝贺各自在反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争中所取得的成就。
    大会主席、几内亚公共工程部长伊斯梅尔·杜尔在鼓掌和欢呼声中宣布大会开幕。
    几内亚总统塞古·杜尔致开幕词，他说：亚非各国人民决定在几内亚举行第二届亚非人民团结大会，这表明他们决心采取联合行动来争取实现我们的共同政治和经济愿望并使我们的正当人类要求得到满足。
    他说，几内亚人民和政府委托他来表达他们兄弟般的感激的心情，并重申他们决心继续为我们争取自由、和平和民主进步的共同愿望自觉地忠实地奋斗。
    他在谈到历史性的万隆会议时指出，这次会议表明：对于帝国主义者的罪恶图谋，亚非各国人民的回答是：争取解放的意志，和坚决彻底铲除一切形式的压迫和剥削、彻底铲除外国统治的一切祸根和残余影响。
    塞古·杜尔说，帝国主义正在使用各式各样的政治、经济、财政或军事控制手段来掠夺我们这些国家的无法估计的人力和物质的富源。它们仍然试图采用它们的分而治之的策略。为了阻止工会、政党和亚非国家在反对帝国主义和争取自由的斗争中一致行动，殖民国家正在采用给予“独立”而从远处加以控制的政策。这就是新殖民主义爱用的新方法。新殖民主义的最终目的在于以非洲国家“独立”为幌子继续使我们人民处于从属状态。他说，我们必须警惕帝国主义的分裂和分散注意力的手段。亚非国家人民的团结，是我们共同利益的最好的保证，是实现我们愿望的最可靠的基础。
    他说，那些怀疑我们是否有能力作为国家来参加建设新世界的人，很难掩饰他们的出自统治全球的意愿的可憎的种族主义和优越感。
    他说，使世界动荡不安的原因是种族主义和侵略主义的行为；是自私自利；是压迫和剥削的势力。我们不能不认为，我们反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争是世界范围维护和平的斗争的一个决定性的方面。
    他说，掠夺殖民地的势力为了达到它们的统治和剥削的目的，使用了分裂和分散注意力的手段。因此我们必须以无限的警惕来注视那些可能威胁我们的统一和危及我们的团结的一切行动，只要存在着被征服的国家和被掠夺的人民，只要我们有一寸领土被外国占领，只要我们有一部分财产为他人所窃据，我们的共同任务就远没有完成。我们将一道继续进行我们争取人类解放和社会正义的事业。
    杜尔总统讲话之后，亚非人民团结理事会书记处总书记优素福·西巴伊作了关于书记处的工作的报告。
    几内亚代表团团长、大会主席伊斯梅尔·杜尔宣读了中国代表团团长廖承志和代表团副团长刘宁一和包尔汉写给他的信，信中揭露帝国主义者的破坏活动，他们捏造了以郭沫若的名义致大会的“电报”。
    中国代表团的信件说：“我们接到了以郭沫若先生的名义致大会的一份捏造的电报。这是彻头彻尾的凭空捏造，是帝国主义者的阴谋诡计之一，目的在于破坏这次大会，并对亚非国家的团结进行挑拨离间。中国代表团为此严正地否认这一伪造的污蔑性文件。”
    在宣读了中国代表团的信件之后，伊斯梅尔·杜尔向中国代表团表示感谢，并警告帝国主义者和他们的代理人放规矩些。他说，我们决心要使大会获得胜利，决不能容忍对大会的任何破坏活动。他敦请大家提高警惕。杜尔的讲话受到代表们的长时间的鼓掌欢迎。
    在会上宣读了中华人民共和国总理周恩来、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫、几内亚总统塞古·杜尔、阿联总统纳赛尔、加纳总理恩克鲁玛以及其他人致大会的贺电。
