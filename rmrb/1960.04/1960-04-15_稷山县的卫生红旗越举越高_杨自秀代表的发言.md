Chairman, fellow delegates:

    I wholeheartedly endorse the various reports of the conference and will resolutely implement them. Here, I would like to report to the conference on the model deeds of Jishan County in eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene.

    Jishan County is a model county for public health in Shanxi Province and also a model county for high wheat yields. I recently inspected Jishan County for a short time, but the things I saw and heard were very inspiring. As soon as we arrived in Jishan County, we heard these two rhymes, one describing rural summer hygiene:

        No bedbugs bite anywhere, no rats plague any home.
        No flies bother during the day, no mosquitoes bite at night.
        Tidy roads, snow-white walls, flowers and trees fill the ground with fragrance.
        Every household is like a bridal chamber, everyone's face glows red.

    The other rhyme describes environmental sanitation:

        The environment is clean and the atmosphere is new, pines and willows provide green shade.
        The street gardens are beautifully landscaped, the air is fresh and people live longer.
        Look at the streets, how beautiful, smooth roads and snow-white walls.
        Look at the yards, how refreshing, flowers and plants fill the courtyard with fragrance.
        Look at the homes, how comfortable, bedding is neat and the floor is spotless.
        Every home has three more treasures: a spittoon, a toothbrush, and a toothbrush mug.

    After the visit, I deeply felt that these rhymes are indeed a true and vivid portrayal of the sanitary conditions in Jishan County.

    Here, the old society's phenomenon of garbage everywhere and disease prevalent in the countryside has long since disappeared forever. Now, everywhere there is a moving scene of everyone being healthy, cities and towns being clean, livestock breeding thriving, and the environment being completely new. The key villages throughout the county have systematically reformed residential lanes. Streets that were historically narrow and uneven have become wide and flat roads, swept clean. Yang and willow trees have been planted along both sides of the roads, and greening and beautification have been carried out everywhere. Many colorful propaganda pictures are painted on the walls, and various sanitary regulations and sanitary covenants are written. All the county's toilets have been renovated, the villages have improved manure pits, new manure fermentation sites have been built, dilapidated walls and broken houses have been repaired, and environmental sanitation has been greatly improved. The environmental hygiene of livestock and poultry, which had always been neglected, has also been improved. Chicken coops are all "three-story buildings," with the upper layer for laying eggs, the middle layer for resting, and the lower layer for feces. Pig pens have three separate areas for sleeping, eating, and defecating. The new large-scale pig farms also have "pig kindergartens" and "pig maternity wards." In the wheat fields outside the villages, the green wheat seedlings are growing vigorously, and the newly built high-yield autumn fields are as flat as mirrors, as if the entire field has been swept.

    The most striking thing is that, adapting to the characteristics of collectivized production and life in the communes, sanitary medical and health organizations and systems have been established in all collective labor sites and collective production and welfare units such as public canteens and nurseries, and many new sanitary facilities have been added. More than 4,000 field toilets and "mobile toilets" have been established in the garden-style high-yield fields throughout the county. The "five-to-the-field" system (doctors, health organizations, medical protection, health education, and health measures) and the labor protection system of "two brings" (bringing health kits and boiled water) and "five preventions" (preventing heatstroke, frostbite, injury, poisoning, and disease) are implemented. Health clinics, health rooms, laundry groups, bathhouses, and barber shops have also been established on water conservancy construction sites. With the liberation of women's labor force, the "five periods" of women's menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, illness, and breastfeeding are earnestly implemented with tagging, and the "three adjustments and three no adjustments" (adjust to dry, not wet during menstruation; adjust to light, not heavy during pregnancy; adjust to near, not far during breastfeeding) system is implemented. The result of this is that labor force is indeed protected. In 1959, industrial accidents decreased by more than 60% compared with 1958. The sanitation work of collective welfare undertakings is also deeply impressive. The sanitation work of the thirteen public canteens in the county can be compared with the canteens of urban agencies. The kitchens are all equipped with "dust-free stoves," which separate burning firewood from cooking food. Firewood is burned outdoors, and food is cooked indoors, which not only eliminates smoke and dust, but also prevents heatstroke and cools down in summer. There are running water hand washers at the entrance of the dining hall. People habitually turn on the faucet, wash their hands before eating. The blackboard has the introduction of the menu and dietary nutrition and hygiene knowledge. The canteen cooks and stir-fries dishes according to this menu every day, and the management area produces vegetables according to this menu. The newly built kindergartens, maternity hospitals, and homes for the elderly are all taken care of meticulously. All kindergartens have locally made running water equipment for washing faces and bathing. Educators have received special training and immediately isolate children when they find they are sick and ask doctors to treat them. The maternity hospitals we visited, although simple in equipment, are indeed very effective. The maternity hospitals hang a table of expected delivery dates for all pregnant women in the area. Pregnant women receive regular check-ups and maternal and child health education before delivery, and are admitted to the delivery waiting room before their expected delivery date. Some villages have maternity hospitals and baby rooms together, and infants are cared for by full-time nannies. The commune also subsidizes milk and goat milk, and sends them to nurseries at about ten months old. Our new generation is growing up happily. In Jishan County, "puerperal fever" and "postpartum wind" have been eliminated. The infant survival rate reaches 99.5%. Commune members praise the maternity hospital as an insurance hospital that "insures everyone, protects both mother and child."

    The health care network is rapidly developing, with hospitals in every commune, health stations in every district, and health rooms in every production team.

    The health care network in Jishan County has new developments. The county already has two well-equipped county people's hospitals, thirteen commune hospitals, and one hundred and thirty-five health stations, not only achieving hospitals in every commune and health stations in every district (management area), but also achieving health rooms in every production team and disease elimination groups in every ten households. The village health workers, midwives, childcare workers, cooks, breeders, and manure managers have all received short-term training. The hygiene science knowledge education for the broad masses has developed from general propaganda to universal learning in hygiene night schools, a systematic publicity and education stage. At present, of the 350,000 people in the county, more than 200,000 understand the prevention and treatment methods of general diseases. On this basis, the county has universally implemented a collective health care system, where each person only needs to pay two yuan in health care fees per year and can receive all free epidemic prevention and treatment. Loving cleanliness and paying attention to hygiene has become a new trend in rural areas. Not only do every household attach importance to cleanliness and hygiene, but everyone has also developed good hygiene habits such as washing their hands and faces frequently, washing their clothes frequently, getting regular haircuts and baths, and not spitting everywhere. Carrying out large-scale hygiene campaigns is a great revolutionary movement to change customs and transform the world. The experience of Jishan County fully proves this point. The county has not only changed the backward sanitary conditions and enabled farmers to start a happy collective life for the first time in recorded history, but also changed people's mental outlook. Taking hygiene as honor and unhygienic as shame has become a common public opinion in rural areas. The feudal superstition of leaving everything to fate when encountering diseases in the past has been completely broken, and the belief that man can conquer nature has been firmly established. People here generally believe that the four pests can be eliminated, diseases that endanger health can be eliminated, and under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, any difficulties can be overcome and anything can be accomplished. It should be especially mentioned that Jishan County, after years of unremitting efforts in carrying out large-scale hygiene campaigns, has achieved significant results in eliminating pests and diseases and promoting production. Now, the four pests have been basically eradicated in the county, and various diseases have been significantly reduced. Infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, and relapsing fever have been basically controlled, and the incidence rate has been decreasing year by year. In 1959, it decreased by 62.89% compared with 1958. Here, disease elimination work has entered a new stage of universal treatment of general diseases. Since 1959, on the basis of a general survey of people's health, diseases such as trachoma, hemorrhoids, intestinal parasites, endometritis, and trichomonas vaginalis have been treated in a concentrated manner. People who have been ill for a long time and those with chronic diseases have also recovered their health and participated in production. Usually, everyone consciously prevents the spread of diseases. There was such a thing in Sun Village: elementary school student Liu Mudan contracted a slight cold at her grandmother's house and asked her father to report to the health station for help with treatment after returning to the village. At the same time, in order to avoid infecting other classmates, she temporarily asked for leave and did not go to school. Due to the reduction of diseases and the enhancement of people's physical fitness, the labor attendance rate is often maintained at about 98%. This has powerfully promoted the great leap forward in production. In 1959, Jishan County created the highest record of average unit yield of wheat in Shanxi Province and became an advanced county in wheat production (the wheat yield per mu in the county in 1959 increased by 94.6% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958), which is inseparable from their outstanding achievements on the health front.

    The great achievements in health work are primarily due to strengthening the leadership of the Party.

    The reason why Jishan County has been able to achieve great achievements in health work is primarily due to strengthening the leadership of the Party and adhering to putting politics in command. From the county to the commune, the management area, and the production team, the county implements leadership by the secretary at every level, putting health work on the agenda of the Party organization. In each period, the Party committee proposes new content and new requirements to encourage the masses to move forward. After the National Rural Health Work Jishan On-site Conference, in order to prevent the masses from slackening their fighting spirit, the CPC Jishan County Committee timely put forward the fighting call of "soldiers not removing their armor, horses not stopping, striving to quickly realize the solarization of Sun Village throughout the county." After half a month of hard work, 350,000 people in the county comprehensively and meticulously completed the tasks of "three clearances" and "ten improvements" before the start of spring. Later, the county held a 200,000-person spring health mobilization conference, organized a thousand-person inspection team, and strived to complete the task of eliminating pests and diseases stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule this year.

    The CPC Jishan County Committee especially attaches importance to the ideological leadership of health work. In 1958, the county realized communization. The CPC Jishan County Committee implemented the ideological principle of continuous revolution and revolutionary development stages of Chairman Mao and educated the broad masses to understand that after the people's communization, health care institutions have become a component part of the commune, and health and production are more conducive to close integration, according to the development of production and the changes in the relations of production. At the same time, because the commune carries out large-scale collective production and public welfare undertakings such as large-scale water conservancy construction, running factories and pastures, and deep plowing of land, it not only brings favorable conditions for doing a good job in health work, but also requires health care work to keep up accordingly. Through publicity and education, the broad masses further improved their understanding, clarified the direction, and laid the foundation for doing a good job in health care after the people's communization. Jishan County also correctly solved the relationship between the assault movement and the regular work in the health movement, carrying out repeated struggles to eliminate pests and diseases. They carry out hygiene assault month, hygiene assault ten days, and hygiene assault day every year, and they also adhere to regular hygiene work at ordinary times. They arrange assault movements and regular work on the one hand according to the busy and slack seasons of agriculture, and on the other hand according to the laws of breeding and transmission of diseases. The county's health work can bloom in an all-round way and reap a large-area harvest due to the adoption of the working methods of inserting red flags, setting up pacesetters, leading the whole area from points, and combining points and areas.
	Putting health and production into one rope

    Closely combining health work with production, starting from production, serving production, and twisting health and production into one rope is an important experience of Jishan County in carrying out health movement. At the beginning, some people thought that there was a contradiction between production and health, and that doing a good job in health would inevitably affect production. In order to solve this problem, the Jishan County Committee specially summarized the experience of Sun Village, a model village for health combined with production. This village used to be a backward village in production. Since the large-scale health movement combined with production, in 1956, not only did the village eliminate the four pests in health work, and neither humans nor animals suffered from infectious diseases, but it also achieved a bumper harvest in production. The grain yield per mu increased by 70% compared with 1952. Since then, the grain output of this village has achieved bumper harvests year after year, making the backward village in production transformed into the advanced village in production in the whole county. This fact proves that health and production are complementary and mutually promoting, and the statement that health and production are opposed to each other is unfounded. After the experience of Sun Village was universally promoted, it promoted the patriotic health movement in the whole county. Now, the county has already explored some experience in combining health and production. In leadership methods, the main method is to implement the "five unifications" of health and production from the county to the production team (namely, unified planning, unified deployment, unified inspection, unified reporting, and unified evaluation). That is, while deploying production, deploy and arrange the work of eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene; when inspecting production, inspect the work of eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene; when reporting, evaluating, and summarizing production, combine it with health work, thus unifying the contradiction between health and production. In specific practices, the "five combinations" are implemented, namely, rectifying environmental hygiene, combining manure accumulation and manure management; eliminating rats, combining protecting seeds and protecting grain; doing a good job in labor protection, combining safe production; doing a good job in food hygiene, water source protection, and collective hygiene prevention work, combining the management of canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens; doing a good job in family hygiene, combining recycling waste products and thrifty housekeeping. In the work system and methods, health care work is also made compatible with the production situation and production requirements. For example, the implementation of a collective medical and health care system ensures that commune members can treat diseases early and prevent diseases early. Measures such as tagging and reporting diseases, doctors visiting homes and field inspections, and seeing doctors in the fields are taken to ensure the labor time of commune members, and so on.

    Health work is closely combined with cultural revolution and technical revolution

    Jishan County's health work is not only closely combined with production, but also closely combined with the cultural revolution and the technical revolution. In 1958, when "four no's" was basically realized, the basic elimination of illiteracy among young and middle-aged people and the three popularizations of preschool education, elementary education, and spare-time education were also realized, and mass cultural entertainment and sports activities were also widely carried out. Because health work guarantees and promotes the health of the people and boosts the spirit of the people, it guarantees and promotes the development of various cultural, educational, and sports undertakings. For example, health work deeply penetrates kindergartens, which plays a significant role in guaranteeing and promoting the development of preschool education. Conversely, the development of various cultural, educational, and sports undertakings also promotes health work. In the large-scale publicity of the health movement, the entire cultural and educational network has been activated. Radio, blackboard newspapers, wall newspapers, singing teams, amateur theaters, clubs, exhibition rooms, and schools at all levels have launched health propaganda, making the significance of eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene known to every household. Since 1958, the county has held as many as two hundred and sixty health exhibitions. Now, not only primary and secondary schools, but also spare-time red and expert schools have become important positions for systematically conducting health science knowledge education to the broad masses. As for the role of cultural and educational work in breaking the superstitious ideas of the masses and improving the political awareness and cultural level of the masses in promoting health work, it is of course difficult to estimate. Conversely, health work also plays a great role in breaking the feudal superstitions of the masses, making the masses believe in science, and enhancing the masses' urgent requirements for learning cultural and scientific knowledge. In the combination of health work and technological revolution, on the one hand, Jishan County has vigorously carried out technological revolution and technological innovation in health work, improved the technical level of health care organizations at all levels, and created various tools and health equipment for eliminating the four pests; on the other hand, it has played the role that health work should play in the technological revolution and technological innovation of production. In addition to paying attention to protecting labor in the reform of various tools, it has played a very important role in the innovation of feeding technology and in the innovation of canteen tools and operating technology.

    Fellow delegates, in the past few years, Jishan County has carried out mass health movements with the great spirit of changing customs and transforming the old world, and the whole county has shown a prosperous scene of "increased grain production and longevity." However, the people of the county are not satisfied with the existing achievements. They continue to organize visiting groups to learn from various places and, on the basis of realizing the "solarization" of Sun Village throughout the county, promote the mass health movement by combining it closely with production and marching towards higher standards with the spirit of continuous revolution and boosting revolutionary drive. Their great ambitions are: to completely eliminate the four pests, eliminate all kinds of infectious diseases that seriously endanger people's health, completely control general epidemics and diseases, further improve the health science knowledge level of the people of the county, make most young and middle-aged people have the level of primary health personnel within two years, and improve the intermediate medical personnel in the county to the level of university graduates within three to five years. At the same time, make greater efforts to cultivate good hygiene habits of the people and combine nutritional hygiene with physical exercise, combine health work with the construction of a new socialist countryside, and vigorously carry out greening, beautification, and fragrance to fundamentally change the health conditions of the countryside. I fully believe that under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and under the shining of the Party's general line, their grand ideals will surely be realized.

专栏：

    稷山县的卫生红旗越举越高
    杨自秀代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我衷心拥护大会的各项报告，并且要坚决地贯彻执行。这里，我想把稷山县除四害、讲卫生的模范事迹，向大会作一个汇报。
    稷山县是山西省的卫生模范县，也是小麦丰产模范县。我最近到稷山县视察了一次，时间很短，但是看到听到的许多事情，都非常振奋人心。一到稷山县，我们就听到这么两段顺口溜，一段是描写农村夏季卫生的：
        到处没有臭虫咬，家家没有老鼠闹。
        白天没有蝇子扰，黑夜不觉蚊子咬。
        整齐马路雪白墙，花木满地散芳香。
        家家户户似洞房，人人脸上发红光。
    另一段是描写环境卫生的：
        环境整洁气象新，松柏杨柳绿成荫。
        街心花园景色秀，空气新鲜人寿增。
        街里看，多漂亮，平坦的马路雪白的
            墙。
        院里看，多清爽，花草一院满庭香。
        家里看，多舒畅，被褥整洁地净光。
        家家多了三件宝：痰盂、牙刷和牙缸。
    参观以后，深深地感到这些顺口溜，的确是稷山县卫生面貌的真实而又生动的写照。
    在这里，旧社会农村的那种垃圾遍地、疾病流行的现象，早已永远一去不复返了，如今到处出现的是人人身体健康，城乡处处干净，六畜繁殖兴旺，环境焕然一新的一片动人景象。全县各重点村有步骤地改革了居民巷，历来窄狭不平的街道，已经变成宽广平坦的马路，打扫的一干二净。公路两旁，栽杨植柳，普遍进行了绿化和美化。墙上画着许多彩色的宣传画，写着多种多样的卫生制度和卫生公约。全县厕所都已经过整修，各村改良了堆肥坑，新建粪便发酵场，修整残墙破屋，大大改善了环境卫生。一向被人们忽视的牲畜、家禽的环境卫生也改善了。鸡窝都是“三层楼”，上层下蛋，中层休息，下层是粪便。猪圈是寝、食、便三隔离。新建的大型猪场里还有“猪幼儿园”“猪产院”。村外的麦田里，茁壮地生长着绿油油的麦苗，新建的秋田丰产方，平整如镜，好像整个田野都被清扫过一样。
    最引人注意的是，适应公社生产和生活集体化的特点，在所有集体劳动的场所和公共食堂、托儿所等集体生产和福利事业单位，建立起卫生医疗保健组织和制度，还增加了许多新的卫生设施。全县在园田化丰产方已经建立了四千多个田间厕所和“流动厕所”，实行了医生、保健组织、医疗保护、卫生教育、卫生措施“五到田”的制度和“两带”（带保健箱和开水）“五防”（防暑、防冻、防伤、防毒、防病）的劳动保护制度。在水利工地上，还建立了卫生所、保健室、洗衣组、澡塘和理发室。随着妇女劳动力的解放，还认真地贯彻了妇女经、孕、产、病、哺乳五期挂签，“三调三不调”
  （经期调干不调湿、孕期调轻不调重、哺乳调近不调远）的制度。这样作的结果，确实保护了劳动力，1959年工伤事故，比1958年就下降了60％以上。集体福利事业的卫生工作，也给人留下深刻的印象。全县十三个公社的公共食堂，卫生工作可以和城市机关的食堂媲美。厨房都设有“无尘灶”，就是把烧火和做饭分开，室外烧火，屋内做饭，既没有烟尘，夏季还可以防暑降温。饭厅门口有流水洗手器，人们习惯地打开水龙头，先洗净手，才吃饭。在黑板上，写着食谱和饮食营养卫生知识的介绍，食堂每天根据这个食谱做饭、炒菜，管理区又根据这个食谱生产蔬菜。新建的幼儿园、妇产院、敬老院，都受到无微不至的照顾。所有幼儿园都有土法制造的流水洗脸和洗澡的设备。教养员受过专门的训练，发现孩子有病，马上隔离，请医生治疗。我们到过的妇产院，设备虽然简单，作用确很不小。产院挂着本地区所有孕妇的预产期表，孕妇在产前就受到定期检查和妇幼卫生教育，并在预产前进住待产室。有些村庄的妇产院和婴儿室设在一起，婴儿有专职的保育员照料，公社还给牛奶、羊奶补助，到十个月左右，就送进托儿所了。我们的新生一代，就是这样在幸福中成长。在稷山县，“产褥热”和“四六风”已被消灭。婴儿成活率达到99.5％。社员称赞妇产院是“个个都保险，母子两保全”的保险院。
      卫生保健网迅速发展，社社有医院、区区有保健站，每个生产队有保健室
    稷山县的卫生保健网又有新的发展。全县已有两座设备良好的县人民医院，十三座公社医院，一百三十五个保健站，不但做到了社社有医院、区区（管理区）有保健站，而且做到了每个生产队都有保健室，每十户都有除害灭病组。各村的保健员、助产员、保育员、炊事员、饲养员、粪便管理员等都普遍受过短期训练。对广大群众的卫生科学知识教育，已由一般的宣传发展到普遍进入卫生夜校学习，系统的宣传教育阶段。目前全县三十五万群众中，已有二十多万人懂得了一般疾病的预防和治疗办法。在这个基础上，全县普遍实行了集体保健医疗制度，每人全年只需要交纳两元保健费，便可全部免费防疫治疗。爱清洁、讲卫生，在农村中已经形成了新风尚。不但做到了家家户户重视清洁卫生，而且人人都养成了勤洗手脸、勤洗衣服、勤理发洗澡和不随地吐痰等良好的卫生习惯。大搞卫生运动，是一个伟大的移风易俗改造世界的革命运动。稷山县的经验完全证明这点。全县不但改变了落后的卫生面貌，使农民从有历史记载以来第一次开始了幸福的集体生活，而且还改变了人们的精神面貌。以卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱，已经成为农村的共同舆论。过去遇病听天由命的封建迷信思想，已彻底破除，人定胜天的信念已经牢固地树立起来。这里的人们普遍地认为：四害能消灭，危害身体健康的疾病能消灭，在党和毛主席的领导下，什么困难也能克服，什么事情也能干成。应该特别提到，稷山县经过几年来坚持不懈的大搞卫生运动，已经在除害灭病、促进生产上，取得重大的成绩。现在，全县四害已经基本绝迹，各种疾病显著减少。伤寒、霍乱、回归热等传染病已基本控制，发病率逐年下降，1959年比1958年降低了62.89％，在这里灭病工作已进入到普治一般疾病的新阶段。1959年以来，在普查人民身体健康状况的基础上，又集中治疗了沙眼、痔疮、肠寄生虫、子宫内膜炎、阴道滴虫等疾病。使一些久病不愈和患有慢性病的人也恢复了健康，参加了生产。平时人人都自觉预防疾病的传染。太阳村有过这样一件事情：小学生刘牡丹在外祖母家里染了轻微的感冒，回村后便让他父亲报告保健站，帮助治疗。同时，为了避免传染其他同学，暂时请假不去上学。由于疾病减少，人民体质增强，劳动出勤率经常保持在98％左右。这便有力地促进了生产的大跃进。1959年稷山县创造了山西全省小麦平均单位产量的最高纪录，成为小麦丰产的先进县（1959年全县小麦亩产比大跃进的1958年提高了94.6％），这与他们在卫生战线上取得的卓越成就分不开的。
      卫生工作取得巨大成绩，首先在于加强党的领导
    稷山县的卫生工作所以能够取得巨大的成绩，首先在于加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。这个县从县到公社、管理区、生产队，都实行层层书记挂帅，把卫生工作列入党组织的议事日程。每个时期，党委都提出新的内容，新的要求，鼓舞群众前进。在全国农村卫生工作稷山现场会议后，为了防止群众松懈斗志，中共稷山县委及时提出了“兵不卸甲，马不停蹄，力争在全县范围内迅速实现太阳村化”的战斗号召。全县三十五万人经过半个月的奋战，在开春前就全面细致地完成了“三清除”“十改良”的任务。以后，全县又召开了二十万人的春季卫生誓师动员大会，组织了千人检查团，力争在今年提前完成全国农业发展纲要所规定的除害灭病任务。
    中共稷山县委特别重视对卫生工作的思想领导。1958年，全县实现了公社化，中共稷山县委贯彻毛主席的不断革命和革命发展阶段论的思想原则，根据生产的发展和生产关系的变革，教育广大群众认识了人民公社化以后，卫生保健机构已经成为公社的组成部分，卫生和生产更加便于密切结合。同时，由于公社大搞水利建设、大办工厂、牧场和深翻土地等大规模的集体生产和公共福利事业，既给搞好卫生工作带来了有利条件，也更要求卫生保健工作相应地跟上去。通过宣传教育，使广大群众进一步提高认识，明确方向，为人民公社化后搞好卫生保健工作奠定了基础。稷山县在卫生运动中，还正确地解决了突击运动和经常工作的关系，进行除害灭病的反复斗争。他们每年都要开展卫生突击月、卫生突击旬和卫生突击日，平时还坚持经常的卫生工作。他们安排突击运动和经常工作是，一面根据农业忙闲的情况，一面又针对病害繁殖和传播的规律。全县卫生工作能够全面开花、获得大面积丰收，是由于采用了插红旗、树标兵、以点带面、点面结合的工作方法。	把卫生和生产拧成一股绳
    在卫生工作中密切结合生产，从生产出发，为生产服务，把卫生和生产拧成一股绳，是稷山县开展卫生运动的一条重要经验。开始有些人认为：生产和卫生有矛盾，搞好卫生就必然要影响生产。为了解决这个问题，稷山县委专门总结了卫生模范村——太阳村卫生结合生产的经验，这个村原来是生产落后村，自从大搞结合生产的卫生运动以后，1956年不仅在卫生工作上消灭了四害，人畜都没有发生传染病，而且在生产上也获得了大丰收。粮食亩产比1952年提高70％。以后，这个村的粮食产量又连年获得丰收，使生产落后村一变而为全县的生产先进村。这个事实证明：卫生和生产是相辅相成、相互促进的，把卫生和生产对立起来的说法是没有根据的。太阳村的经验普遍推广后，推动了全县的爱国卫生运动。现在，全县在卫生和生产相结合上已经摸索到一些经验。在领导方法上，主要是从县到生产队实行卫生和生产的“五统一”（即统一计划、统一部署、统一检查、统一汇报、统一评比）的办法。这就是在部署生产的同时，部署和安排除四害、讲卫生工作；在检查生产时，检查除四害、讲卫生工作；在汇报、评比、总结生产时，都结合卫生工作，这样便把卫生和生产的矛盾统一起来了。在具体作法上是实行“五结合”，即整顿环境卫生，结合积肥和粪便管理；消灭老鼠，结合保种保粮；做好劳动保护，结合安全生产；做好饮食卫生、水源保护和集体卫生预防工作，结合食堂、托儿所幼儿园的管理；做好家庭卫生，结合收回废品和勤俭持家。在工作制度和方法上，也使卫生保健工作和生产情况、生产要求相适应。例如，实行集体医疗保健制度，保证社员能够有病早治、无病早防，采取挂签报病、医生上门和田间巡回、地头看病的办法，保证社员的劳动时间，等等。
    卫生工作和文化革命、技术革命紧密结合
    稷山县的卫生工作不仅和生产紧密结合，而且和文化革命与技术革命紧密结合。1958年，当基本实现“四无”的时候，也实现了青壮年基本无盲和幼儿教育、小学教育、业余教育的三普及，群众性的文化娱乐体育活动也广泛开展起来。由于卫生工作保证和增进了人民的健康，振奋了人民的精神，就保证和促进了各项文化教育体育事业的发展。例如，卫生工作深入幼儿园，对保证和促进幼儿教育事业的发展起了重大的作用。反过来各项文化教育体育事业的发展，也促进了卫生工作。在卫生运动的大宣传中，整个的文化教育网都活动起来，广播、黑板报、墙报、歌咏队、业余剧团、俱乐部、展览室以及各级各类学校都展开了卫生宣传，使除四害、讲卫生的意义做到了家喻户晓。自1958年以来，全县举办的卫生展览，即达二百六十次之多。现在，不但中小学，而且业余红专学校也已经成为系统地向广大群众进行卫生科学知识教育的重要阵地。至于通过文化教育工作，破除了群众的迷信思想，提高了群众的政治觉悟与文化水平，对于促进卫生工作的作用，当然更是难以估量的。反过来卫生工作在破除群众的封建迷信，使群众相信科学，并增强了群众学习文化科学知识的迫切要求的作用也是很大的。在卫生工作与技术革命相结合中，稷山县一方面在卫生工作中大搞技术革命与技术革新，提高了各级卫生保健组织的技术水平，创造了多种除四害的工具和卫生设备；另一方面又在生产的技术革命与技术革新上发挥了卫生工作应起的作用，除了在各项工具改革中注意了保护劳动力之外，特别在饲养技术的革新上，在食堂工具和操作技术的革新上都起了十分重大的作用。
    各位代表，稷山县几年来，以移风易俗改造旧世界的伟大气概，大搞群众性的卫生运动，全县已经出现了“粮食增产，人寿年丰”的繁荣景象。但是，全县人民并不满足已有的成绩，他们继续组织参观团到各地去学习，并且在全县实现“太阳村化”的基础上，以不断革命的精神，大鼓革命干劲，密切结合生产，大搞群众性的卫生运动，向更高的标准进军。他们的雄心大志是：彻底消灭四害，消灭各种严重危害人民健康的传染疾病，彻底控制一般的流行病，疾病，进一步提高全县人民的卫生科学知识水平，在二年之内使大部分青壮年具有初级卫生人员的程度，在三、五年内将全县中级医务人员提高到大学毕业的水平，同时，尽更大努力培养人民群众的良好卫生习惯，并把营养卫生与体育锻炼结合起来，把卫生工作和建设社会主义新农村结合起来，大搞绿化美化香化，从根本上改变农村的卫生面貌。我完全相信，在党和毛主席的领导之下，在党的总路线光辉照耀之下，他们的宏伟理想是一定能够实现的。
