Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China held a grand reception in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People tonight to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the historically significant Bandung Conference.

    The reception was held in a warm atmosphere. In their speeches, the guests emphasized the need to further promote the Bandung spirit. They warmly congratulated the great unity of the Asian and African peoples, the new victories of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit, and world peace.

    Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice-Chairmen Lin Boqu, Shen Junru, Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, Vice-Premiers of the State Council He Long, Xi Zhongxun and other state leaders attended the reception. Also present were Vice-Ministers of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo, Ji Pengfei, Zeng Yongquan, Geng Biao, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association Liu Changsheng, and people from all walks of life in China.

    At the beginning of the reception, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo gave a speech, saying that today is the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference. The people of Asian and African countries and the people of all peace-loving countries in the world are warmly commemorating this festival, which marks the unity of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism, colonialism, and in defense of world peace. We are very pleased to be able to celebrate this festival with you here. On behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Luo Guibo extended a warm welcome and heartfelt thanks to the heads of diplomatic missions of various countries in China and guests from various countries who attended the reception.

    Vice-Premier He Long spoke at the reception, saying that today we are pleased to gather with the heads of diplomatic missions of various countries in China and friends from Asian and African countries to jointly commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I would like to extend warm congratulations to the foreign guests present and, through you, to the people of Asian and African countries, wishing them new and significant victories, inspired by the Bandung spirit, in the cause of unity against imperialism, safeguarding peace, and promoting friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries.

    He Long said that in the past five years, under the influence of the Bandung spirit, the cause of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and colonialism, for the attainment and maintenance of national independence, and for the defense of world peace has achieved extremely significant successes. Currently, in Africa, the national independence movement is flourishing, and new independent countries are being born one after another. The Algerian people are victoriously persisting in their just war against French colonialism, and the South African people are waging a sharp struggle against racial discrimination and in defense of basic human rights. In Asia, the struggle to maintain national independence and fight for democracy has deepened. The Japanese people are engaged in an indomitable struggle against the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and for the establishment of an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan. The Vietnamese people are resolutely fighting against the United States for undermining the 1954 Geneva Accords, increasing military personnel in South Vietnam, and intensifying tensions in the Indochina region.

    He Long said that the Asian and African peoples are continuously dealing heavy blows to the imperialists with a momentum that defies all obstacles. However, the imperialist and colonialist bloc headed by the United States is not reconciled to its own defeat and attempts to maintain colonial rule and pursue a policy of aggression and expansion by various means. No matter how the imperialists struggle, as long as the Asian and African peoples strengthen their unity, heighten their vigilance, and persist in their struggle with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, they will surely be able to defeat all the conspiracies of imperialism and achieve greater victories.

    He said that the Chinese government and people have always followed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit in developing friendly and cooperative relations with Asian and African countries. The Chinese government and people resolutely support the just struggle of the Asian and African peoples. We are confident that the friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese people and the Asian and African peoples will develop increasingly, and all the divisive plots and tricks of imperialism will be thoroughly bankrupt.

    Vice-Premier He Long finally asked everyone to raise their glasses for the greater victory of the Asian and African peoples in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for the attainment and maintenance of national independence; for the further strengthening and development of the great unity and friendly cooperation of the Asian and African peoples; for the new victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit; and for world peace.

    Head of the diplomatic corps, Afghan Ambassador to China Abdul Samad, spoke at the reception, saying, "I am pleased to represent the heads of diplomatic missions, diplomats, and their wives and myself to thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China for inviting us to attend this reception."

    As a representative of a participating country in the Bandung Conference, I am particularly pleased to see that the resolutions and principles adopted in Bandung have had a significant impact on the social, economic, and political development of the vast number of people. Not only that, but these principles constitute a good foundation for developing international relations in order to maintain peace and promote better understanding among countries.

    Abdul Samad said that on this great festival, I believe our best way of commemorating is to recall the resolutions and the sacred ten principles unanimously adopted at the Bandung Conference. The Bandung Conference seriously considered the issues of world peace and cooperation, and the ten principles call on countries to live in peace like friendly neighbors and develop friendly and cooperative relations, treating each other with trust and goodwill and without mutual fears. These principles are as effective and valuable today as they were five years ago. Let us hope that these principles will continue to guide all countries in the world into an era of peace and friendship, an era of international understanding and cooperation.

    At the reception, the head of the Algerian youth delegation, Shabbi Hashemi, deputy director of the Youth and Sports Committee of the Algerian National Liberation Front, presented the Algerian flag to Chairman Zhu De on behalf of the Algerian youth delegation and the Algerian student delegation. When presenting the flag, Shabbi Hashemi said: "Our Algerian people have been fighting for five years. In this struggle, we have sacrificed one million people. Please accept this Algerian flag as an expression of our gratitude to the great Chinese people for their support for the Algerian people's anti-colonialist struggle." Chairman Zhu De shook hands tightly with Shabbi Hashemi after receiving the Algerian flag from Shabbi Hashemi. At this time, warm applause rang out throughout the venue.

    The heads of diplomatic missions, charge d'affaires, acting representatives, and diplomatic officials of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Mongolian People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic, Albania, the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, India, Denmark, Burma, Indonesia, Switzerland, Finland, Pakistan, Norway, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, the United Arab Republic, Ceylon, Iraq, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and other countries in China, as well as their wives, attended tonight's reception.

    我国外交部举行盛大招待会纪念万隆会议五周年
    新华社18日讯　中华人民共和国外交部今晚在人民大会堂宴会厅举行盛大招待会，纪念有伟大历史意义的万隆会议五周年。
    招待会在热烈的气氛中举行。宾主们在讲话中强调要进一步发扬万隆精神，他们热烈祝贺亚非人民的大团结，祝贺和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的新胜利，祝贺世界和平。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长朱德，副委员长林伯渠、沈钧儒、陈叔通、程潜，国务院副总理贺龙、习仲勋等国家领导人，出席了招待会。出席招待会的还有外交部副部长罗贵波、姬鹏飞、曾涌泉、耿飚，对外文化联络委员会主任张奚若，对外文化协会会长楚图南，中国非洲人民友好协会会长刘长胜，和中国各方面的人士。
    招待会开始时，外交部副部长罗贵波讲话，他说，今天是万隆会议召开的五周年纪念日，亚非各国人民和全世界一切爱好和平国家的人民，都在热烈纪念这个标志着亚非人民团结起来反对帝国主义、殖民主义和维护世界和平的节日。我们十分高兴能和大家一起在这里欢庆这个节日。罗贵波代表中华人民共和国外交部，向出席招待会的各国驻华使节和各国来宾表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢。
    贺龙副总理在招待会上讲话，他说，今天我们高兴地同各国驻华使节和亚非各国的朋友们欢聚一堂，共同纪念万隆会议五周年。我谨代表中国政府和人民，向到会的各国外宾，并且通过你们向亚非各国人民，致以热烈的祝贺，祝他们在万隆精神的鼓舞下，在团结反帝、维护和平、促进亚非各国友好合作的事业中取得新的重大的胜利。
    贺龙说，过去五年来，在万隆精神影响下，亚非各国人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立、保卫世界和平的事业，取得了极其重大的成就。目前，在非洲，民族独立运动正在蓬勃发展，新的独立国家一个接着一个诞生。阿尔及利亚人民胜利地坚持着反对法国殖民主义的正义战争，南非人民进行着反对种族歧视、维护基本人权的尖锐斗争。在亚洲，维护民族独立和争取民主的斗争有了深入的发展。日本人民为反对日美安全条约，建立一个独立、民主、和平和中立的日本，正在进行百折不挠的斗争。越南人民正在为反对美国破坏1954年日内瓦协议，在南越增加军事人员、加紧印度支那地区紧张局势而进行坚决斗争。
    贺龙说，亚非各国人民正以乘风破浪的气势，不断地给帝国主义者以沉重打击。但是，以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义集团并不甘心于它们自己的失败，妄图以各种手法，保持殖民统治，推行侵略扩张政策。不论帝国主义怎样挣扎，只要亚非人民加强团结，提高警惕，在全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，坚持斗争，就一定能够击破帝国主义的一切阴谋，取得更大的胜利。
    他说，中国政府和人民一向遵循和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，同亚非各国发展友好合作的关系。中国政府和人民坚决支持亚非人民的正义斗争。我们确信，中国人民同亚非各国人民的友好合作关系，必将日益发展，帝国主义一切挑拨离间的阴谋诡计，必将彻底破产。
    贺龙副总理最后请大家举杯，为亚非人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立斗争的更大胜利；为亚非人民的大团结和友好合作关系的进一步加强和发展；为和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的新胜利；为世界和平而干杯。
    外交使团团长、阿富汗驻中国大使阿卜杜勒·萨马德在招待会上讲话，他说，我愉快地代表在座的各国驻华使节、外交官和他们的夫人以及我个人感谢中华人民共和国政府外交部邀请我们出席这次招待会。
    作为万隆会议一个参加国的代表我特别愉快地看到，在万隆通过的各项决议和原则对广大人民的社会、经济和政治的发展已经起了重大的影响。不仅如此，这些原则构成了为维护和平和促进各国间更好的了解而发展国际关系的良好基础。
    阿卜杜勒·萨马德说，在这个伟大的节日，我相信我们最好的纪念方法，就是重新回忆万隆会议所一致通过的决议和神圣的十项原则。万隆会议严肃地考虑了世界和平和合作的问题，十项原则号召各国像友好的邻人一样和平相处，发展友好合作关系，以信任和善意相待而没有彼此的疑惧。这些原则在今天像五年以前一样有效和可贵。让我们希望，这些原则将继续引导世界各国进入一个和平和友谊的时代，国际谅解和合作的时代。
    在招待会上，阿尔及利亚青年代表团团长、阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线青年及体育委员会副主任夏比·哈息米，代表阿尔及利亚青年代表团和阿尔及利亚学生代表团，向朱德委员长献阿尔及利亚的国旗。献旗时夏比·哈息米说：“我们阿尔及利亚人民已进行了五年的斗争，在斗争中，我们牺牲了一百万人民，请您接受这面阿尔及利亚国旗，表示我们感谢伟大的中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民反殖民主义斗争的支持。”朱德委员长从夏比·哈息米手中接过阿尔及利亚国旗后，同夏比·哈息米紧紧握手。这时全场响起了热烈的掌声。
