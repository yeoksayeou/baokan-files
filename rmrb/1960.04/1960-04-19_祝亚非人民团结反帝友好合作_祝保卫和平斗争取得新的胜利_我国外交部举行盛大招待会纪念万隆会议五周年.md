Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China held a grand reception in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People tonight to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the historically significant Bandung Conference.

    The reception was held in a warm atmosphere. In their speeches, the guests emphasized the need to further promote the Bandung spirit. They warmly congratulated the great unity of the Asian and African peoples, the new victories of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit, and world peace.

    Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice-Chairmen Lin Boqu, Shen Junru, Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, Vice-Premiers of the State Council He Long, Xi Zhongxun and other state leaders attended the reception. Also present were Vice-Ministers of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo, Ji Pengfei, Zeng Yongquan, Geng Biao, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association Liu Changsheng, and people from all walks of life in China.

    At the beginning of the reception, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo gave a speech, saying that today is the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference. The people of Asian and African countries and the people of all peace-loving countries in the world are warmly commemorating this festival, which marks the unity of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism, colonialism, and in defense of world peace. We are very pleased to be able to celebrate this festival with you here. On behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Luo Guibo extended a warm welcome and heartfelt thanks to the heads of diplomatic missions of various countries in China and guests from various countries who attended the reception.

    Vice-Premier He Long spoke at the reception, saying that today we are pleased to gather with the heads of diplomatic missions of various countries in China and friends from Asian and African countries to jointly commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I would like to extend warm congratulations to the foreign guests present and, through you, to the people of Asian and African countries, wishing them new and significant victories, inspired by the Bandung spirit, in the cause of unity against imperialism, safeguarding peace, and promoting friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries.

    He Long said that in the past five years, under the influence of the Bandung spirit, the cause of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and colonialism, for the attainment and maintenance of national independence, and for the defense of world peace has achieved extremely significant successes. Currently, in Africa, the national independence movement is flourishing, and new independent countries are being born one after another. The Algerian people are victoriously persisting in their just war against French colonialism, and the South African people are waging a sharp struggle against racial discrimination and in defense of basic human rights. In Asia, the struggle to maintain national independence and fight for democracy has deepened. The Japanese people are engaged in an indomitable struggle against the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and for the establishment of an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan. The Vietnamese people are resolutely fighting against the United States for undermining the 1954 Geneva Accords, increasing military personnel in South Vietnam, and intensifying tensions in the Indochina region.

    He Long said that the Asian and African peoples are continuously dealing heavy blows to the imperialists with a momentum that defies all obstacles. However, the imperialist and colonialist bloc headed by the United States is not reconciled to its own defeat and attempts to maintain colonial rule and pursue a policy of aggression and expansion by various means. No matter how the imperialists struggle, as long as the Asian and African peoples strengthen their unity, heighten their vigilance, and persist in their struggle with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, they will surely be able to defeat all the conspiracies of imperialism and achieve greater victories.

    He said that the Chinese government and people have always followed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit in developing friendly and cooperative relations with Asian and African countries. The Chinese government and people resolutely support the just struggle of the Asian and African peoples. We are confident that the friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese people and the Asian and African peoples will develop increasingly, and all the divisive plots and tricks of imperialism will be thoroughly bankrupt.

    Vice-Premier He Long finally asked everyone to raise their glasses for the greater victory of the Asian and African peoples in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for the attainment and maintenance of national independence; for the further strengthening and development of the great unity and friendly cooperation of the Asian and African peoples; for the new victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit; and for world peace.

    Head of the diplomatic corps, Afghan Ambassador to China Abdul Samad, spoke at the reception, saying, "I am pleased to represent the heads of diplomatic missions, diplomats, and their wives and myself to thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China for inviting us to attend this reception."

    As a representative of a participating country in the Bandung Conference, I am particularly pleased to see that the resolutions and principles adopted in Bandung have had a significant impact on the social, economic, and political development of the vast number of people. Not only that, but these principles constitute a good foundation for developing international relations in order to maintain peace and promote better understanding among countries.

    Abdul Samad said that on this great festival, I believe our best way of commemorating is to recall the resolutions and the sacred ten principles unanimously adopted at the Bandung Conference. The Bandung Conference seriously considered the issues of world peace and cooperation, and the ten principles call on countries to live in peace like friendly neighbors and develop friendly and cooperative relations, treating each other with trust and goodwill and without mutual fears. These principles are as effective and valuable today as they were five years ago. Let us hope that these principles will continue to guide all countries in the world into an era of peace and friendship, an era of international understanding and cooperation.

    At the reception, the head of the Algerian youth delegation, Shabbi Hashemi, deputy director of the Youth and Sports Committee of the Algerian National Liberation Front, presented the Algerian flag to Chairman Zhu De on behalf of the Algerian youth delegation and the Algerian student delegation. When presenting the flag, Shabbi Hashemi said: "Our Algerian people have been fighting for five years. In this struggle, we have sacrificed one million people. Please accept this Algerian flag as an expression of our gratitude to the great Chinese people for their support for the Algerian people's anti-colonialist struggle." Chairman Zhu De shook hands tightly with Shabbi Hashemi after receiving the Algerian flag from Shabbi Hashemi. At this time, warm applause rang out throughout the venue.

    The heads of diplomatic missions, charge d'affaires, acting representatives, and diplomatic officials of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Mongolian People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic, Albania, the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, India, Denmark, Burma, Indonesia, Switzerland, Finland, Pakistan, Norway, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, the United Arab Republic, Ceylon, Iraq, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and other countries in China, as well as their wives, attended tonight's reception.
