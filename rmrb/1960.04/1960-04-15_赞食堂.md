    Praise the Canteen

    The People's Commune is strong,
    The canteen is bright and grand;
    The four walls have paintings,
    Square tables stand in rows;
    It's a meeting place for conferences,
    A classroom for learning;
    Singing and dancing,
    Everyone is joyful;
    Collective life is good,
    Happiness lasts ten thousand years!

              ＊　＊

    In the past, firewood, rice, oil, salt, and tea,
    Were always a worry in our hearts,
    Production and life were hard to manage well,
    Life was chaotic and a mess!
    Now firewood, rice, oil, salt, and tea,
    Are managed by the public canteen,
    Production and life are all good,
    Life is so sweet, our hearts blossom!

            ＊　＊

    In the past: a lock on the door when leaving,
        A fire to start upon returning,
        Busy inside and out,
        Couldn't even take care of our mouths!
    Now: eating in the canteen,
        Life is joyful,
        Working harder at production,
        Our whole bodies are filled with strength!
(Member of Diaopu People's Commune, Taixing County, Jiangsu)

    赞食堂
    人民公社强，
    食堂亮堂堂；
    四壁有图画，
    方桌排成行；
    开会是会场，
    上课做课堂；
    唱歌又跳舞，
    人人喜洋洋；
    集体生活好，
    幸福万年长！
              ＊　＊
    过去柴米油盐茶，
    时时刻刻心牵挂，
    生产生活难管好，
    日子过得乱如麻！
    现在柴米油盐茶，
    公共食堂来管家，
    生产生活样样好，
    日子甜得心开花！
            ＊　＊过去是：出门一把锁，
        进门一把火，
        里里外外忙，
        嘴都管不上！现在是：吃饭进食堂，
        生活乐洋洋，
        加紧忙生产，
        浑身添力量！（江苏泰兴县刁铺人民公社社员）
