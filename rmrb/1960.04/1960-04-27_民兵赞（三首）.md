    Ode to the Militia (Three Poems)
    Private First Class of the People's Liberation Army, Wang Shixiang
    Phoenix Lands on Phoenix Mountain
    Phoenix lands on Phoenix Mountain,
    Girls practice martial arts on the hillside,
    Steps leaping, arms flashing,
    A hundred phoenixes face the sun, wings spread wide.
    Gun on shoulder, gun off shoulder,
    Load bullets, eject bullets;
    See how energetic they practice,
    See how skilled they are!
    Clever girls, clever girls,
    Broad shoulders, rosy cheeks,
    Skilled at plowing, sowing, hoeing,
    Heroic generals on the training ground.
    Field Drill
    A whistle blows,
    Swallows fly in the wheat field;
    A command is given,
    The militia forms rows of human walls.
    In the human walls,
    Bayonets gleam;
    In the bayonets,
    Reflected are the faces of heroes;
    Male militiamen,
    Wear white towels on their heads;
    Female militiamen,
    Braid their hair around their necks.
    Steps march,
    The ground trembles;
    Battle cries shout,
    The sky shakes.
    Waves of song, waves of laughter,
    Gunshots fly, heads held high...
    Fishing Song on the Lake
    A swallow skims the water,
    Two oars play with the waves;
    Sisters-in-law go fishing,
    A boat of laughter, a lake of song.
    A flock of geese flies by the lake,
    The girl tells her sister-in-law with a hand gesture,
    Sister-in-law puts down the oars, picks up the gun,
    The geese fall where the gun sounds.
    The geese fall where the gun sounds,
    Many smiling faces where the geese fall;
    Young men all praise her marksmanship,
    A blush spreads across the sister-in-law's face.
    Just as the girl is about to praise her brother,
    The sister-in-law poles the boat, swift as an arrow,
    "You silly girl, don't be nosy,
    I know you love the good young man in the militia company!"
    The girl casts her net, sings a fishing song,
    The sister-in-law supports the pole, steers the boat;
    A fishing song, a net of silver,
    Silver carp fill the basket on the boat.
    A swallow skims the water,
    Two oars play with the waves;
    The sisters-in-law's fishing boat returns to the canteen,
    A boat of laughter, a lake of song...

    民兵赞（三首）
    解放军上等兵　王石祥
    凤凰山上落凤凰
    凤凰山上落凤凰，
    姑娘练武上山岗，
    步子飞跃胳膊闪，
    百凤朝阳展翅膀。
    枪上肩，枪下肩，
    装子弹，退子弹；
    看她们练得多带劲，
    看她们练得多熟练！
    姑娘巧，巧姑娘，
    宽肩膀，红脸膛，
    耕耩锄刨是行家，
    练兵场上英雄将。
    地头操练
    一阵哨响，
    麦田里燕子飞翔；
    一声口令，
    民兵排成一道道人墙。
    人墙里，
    刺刀闪亮；
    刺刀里，
    映着英雄的脸庞；
    男民兵，
    头系白毛巾；
    女民兵，
    辫子缠在脖子上。
    步子走，
    地发抖；
    杀声喊，
    天摇晃。
    一阵阵歌声一阵阵笑，
    枪声飞散头昂扬……
    湖上渔歌
    一只燕子点水过，
    两把船桨戏水波；
    姑嫂二人去捕鱼，
    一船笑声一湖歌。
    一群大雁湖边过，
    姑娘用手跟嫂说，
    嫂嫂放桨拿起枪，
    枪声响处大雁落。
    枪声响处大雁落，
    大雁落处笑脸多；
    小伙子齐夸枪法好，
    嫂嫂脸上泛红波。
    姑娘才要夸哥哥，
    嫂嫂拨船箭飞梭，
    “你这个丫头甭多嘴，
    知道你爱民兵连的好小伙！”
    姑娘撒网唱渔歌，
    嫂嫂支篙掌住舵；
    一支渔歌一网银，
    船上银鲤上了箩。
    一只燕子点水过，
    两把船桨戏水波；
    姑嫂渔船回食堂，
    一船笑声一湖歌……
