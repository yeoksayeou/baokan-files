    Riding the train on the tracks, carrying by shoulder is completely eliminated; a full load of ore and coke, is just like a boat floating on the water.
    Blast furnaces don't worry about not having enough to eat, I'm not anxious about rain or snow; produce more steel and iron, to repay the Party's good leadership.
    Ou Yuanfang's speech representing the Anhui delegation on the Great Development of Native Railways

    Chairman, fellow representatives:
    I fully endorse the reports made to the congress by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin.
    In the sustained Great Leap Forward of Anhui Province in 1959, a new force emerged on the transportation front – the native railway. Although it has only appeared recently, it has played a huge role in material transportation, saving labor, and reducing labor intensity. Currently, many mines, factories, docks, and people's communes throughout the province have built native railways, and more units are building them or planning to build them.
    Native railways are a product of the Great Leap Forward and the Party's policy of walking on two legs. Since the Great Leap Forward, industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings in our province have developed rapidly, and the volume of transportation has also increased rapidly. Although the development of the transportation industry has also been rapid, it still cannot keep up with the needs. The short-distance transportation problems between steel bases, docks, stone quarries, forest farms, urban areas, and between people's communes and market towns are particularly prominent. Some small blast furnaces are often threatened with shutdown due to the lack of ore or coal supply, and the transfer of agricultural and sideline products is also affected. Under these circumstances, whether the transportation problem can be solved has become the key to continuing the Great Leap Forward. In order to quickly solve this problem, the Provincial Party Committee called on all localities to try out native railways in accordance with the policy of "walking on two legs" and the principle of "easy first, then difficult, short first, then long, and first build in factories and mines mainly producing coal and iron ore and areas with concentrated materials." All parts of the province responded to this call, showing their abilities and trying out and promoting rail transportation methods such as wooden rails, bamboo rails, and ceramic rails to replace carrying by shoulder, saving labor and improving work efficiency. It was in this upsurge of the whole party and the whole people running transportation that the self-built native railway of the Hongqi People's Commune in Huaiyuan County appeared. This native railway played a great role in breaking superstition and emancipating the mind. Then, the 1.7-kilometer-long native railway of Huainan Coal Mine appeared, with a rail weight of 29 kilograms per meter and a gauge of 1,435 millimeters, using locomotives modified from automobiles and self-made carriages, with good results. The province seized these two events and held two on-site meetings in succession in April and May last year to promote their experience. Since then, native railways have gradually spread throughout the province. There are now three types of native railways promoted in our province:
    The first type: large-scale. The roadbed is foreign, the rails are made of high-grade cast iron, weighing 48 kilograms per meter, and can withstand a pressure of 28 tons (it has now been successfully tested to withstand a pressure of 60 tons). The gauge is 1,435 millimeters, as wide as foreign railways, and large locomotives can run on it, realizing the connection between native and foreign railways. For example, there is such a native railway in the western suburbs of Bengbu.
    The second type: medium-sized. The iron rails are also high-grade cast iron, weighing 29 kilograms per meter. There are various types of locomotives. The modified automobiles can pull 100 tons to 200 tons and can transport 2,000 tons per day.
    The third type: small-sized. The rails are cast with ordinary pig iron, weighing more than 10 kilograms per meter. The Hongqi People's Commune in Huaiyuan County is this type of native railway.
    The above three types of native railways, saying they are native, is in relation to foreign railways like the Jinpu Railway. In itself, it is a combination of native and foreign, a combination of large, medium, and small. The iron rails used are different, and the locomotives are also different. Some locomotives are made of gas engines, some are made of diesel engines, some are modified from automobiles, and there are also catenary electric locomotives. In short, they are simple and use local materials. Now our province has built a rail casting factory, which can cast three kilometers of iron rails every day, and the casting length of rails has also increased from two meters to five to eight meters.
    In the process of creating and promoting native railways, all parts of our province encountered many problems, especially technical, equipment, and material difficulties, and also encountered some obstruction from right-leaning conservative thinking. However, due to the resolute implementation of the general line and the policy of walking on two legs, resolutely relying on the masses, launching mass movements on a large scale, and carrying out communist cooperation on a large scale, all difficulties and obstacles have been overcome. The process of the Hongqi People's Commune in Huaiyuan County running native railways is a vivid example.
    The native railway created by the Hongqi People's Commune is the ancestor of Anhui's native railways. This commune is located on the edge of the Huai River. In the Great Leap Forward in 1958, it had realized river networkization, overcame an unprecedented drought, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average grain yield of 826 jin per mu. At the same time, the commune also established 886 small factories. Under the great development of industrial and agricultural production, the transportation task has greatly increased. In 1958, the total transportation volume of the whole commune reached more than 150 million jin, but various transportation tools could only complete more than 80 million jin, and the remaining more than 60 million jin had to rely on carrying by shoulder. This would take up 30% of the whole labor force, especially during the busy farming season. On the one hand, it is necessary to rush to harvest, on the other hand, it is necessary to rush to plant, and on the other hand, it is necessary to rush to transport. If the crops cannot be transported back in time, they will be damaged. Taking care of transporting crops will affect the rush to plant. Comrade Wang Qihou, the first secretary of the commune's Party committee, proposed that the "crooked carts" used in the Huai River governance were very efficient in transporting soil. If a crooked cart road could be built, the transportation problem would be solved. But what if there are no steel rails? Everyone proposed using pig iron instead. But who would make it? Some people suggested that Jiang Mingzhi, a pot mender, might have some knowledge of rail casting. At first, Jiang Mingzhi did not dare to accept the task, because he could only mend pots and cast plows. The Party committee encouraged him to do it, and he said he would try. So the commune bought coke, transported yellow sand from the river beach, and set up a small stove and a small bellows for mending pots, and plastered the stove seams with cow dung. They started working like this. After more than 20 repeated experiments, they finally cast iron rails weighing 13 kilograms per meter. Later, they used the same method to make wheels and axles, and made a hand-operated native locomotive according to the principle of the hand-operated car on foreign railways. This encouraged everyone's confidence. After the successful test, the commune Party committee decided to formally build a native railway, but where would the pig iron, sleepers, and other materials come from? The commune Party committee held a telephone conference, explaining the significance of running native railways to the cadres, and widely publicized and mobilized the masses, encouraging them to collect scrap iron and waste materials. The commune members enthusiastically responded, and as a result, in less than ten days, they collected 350,000 jin of pig iron, more than 2,000 jin of copper, and more than 10,000 pieces of various willow, locust, miscellaneous wood, broken wooden strips, old door frames, and broken furniture. They concentrated 32 blacksmiths from the whole commune to serve as foundry workers, and invited experienced old commune members who had worked on earthwork in the Huai River governance to give guidance. In this way, a 3-kilometer-long native railway was laid from Changjiafen to the edge of the Huai River. Since then, the vast majority of the large amount of materials transferred in and out of the Hongqi People's Commune have been transported through this native railway, greatly saving labor. They also plan to build another 5-kilometer-long medium-sized native railway, so that waterway, highway, and railway transportation are connected to each other, forming a well-connected intra-commune transportation network, completely changing the intra-commune transportation landscape.
    There are many such examples of daring to overcome difficulties, daring to think and act, and relying on one's own efforts. Take the Bengbu Rail Casting Factory as an example. Casting iron rails is a key issue in running native railways. Our province originally not only did not have rail factories and locomotive and vehicle manufacturing factories, but even did not have equipment for manufacturing various parts and materials. Now the Jiulonggang and Bengbu Rail Casting Factories can produce high-grade cast iron rails in batches, and Hefei, Wuhu, Anqing and other places can also cast this kind of iron rails. At the beginning of the construction of the Bengbu Rail Casting Factory, there was nothing. It was Che Xueshi, Hou Leting and other five ordinary stevedores who dared to think and act and started from scratch. They did not have iron smelting equipment, so they found a broken gasoline drum to make an iron smelting furnace; they did not have a blower, so they used a hand-cranked wooden blower to blow air; they did not have sand turning equipment, so they used broken boxes discarded by the soap factory as sand boxes; they did not have iron and coke, so they pulled small carts to collect them everywhere. In this way, they prepared the factory without spending a penny. In the absence of experience, they relied entirely on great ambition and courage, visited teachers and friends, studied hard, and fought hard for more than 20 days, and finally made cast iron rails weighing 29 kilograms per meter. Then they successfully trial-produced 48-kilogram large-sized high-quality iron rails, and soon put them into mass production. These iron rails have been used in the construction of native railways in Bengbu.
    The development of native railways in our province has only been for a year, but the superiority shown by native railways is already very prominent: First, they can use local materials and be simple and crude. Not only can local governments run them, but also people's communes can run them, which can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. Second, the investment is small and the start-up is fast. The cost of large-scale wide-gauge native railways in our province is only one-third of that of foreign railways, and small-scale native railways are even cheaper, so it is easy to quickly promote and popularize them. Third, the transportation volume is large and the cost is low. Many steel plants have built native railways, which ensures the normal supply of ore and coal. For example, after the completion of the 13-kilometer native railway from Fengyang to Linqiao, it saved 36 trucks, 500 flatbed carts, and 70 five-ton wooden boats that were originally responsible for this section of transportation. The daily transportation volume increased from about 1,000 tons to 2,000 tons. The freight has been greatly reduced. According to Bengbu statistics, the freight per ton-kilometer of native railways only costs 5 to 10 cents, which is only one-third of the freight of automobiles and one-eighth to one-sixteenth of the freight of flatbed carts. Fourth, it greatly saves labor. Every kilometer of native railway built can save 1,500 to 2,000 laborers, which is 400 to 500 laborers more than flatbed carts. According to the statistics of the Hongqi Commune, their 4.5-horsepower locomotive saves 92,000 labor days every day. Fifth, it greatly reduces labor intensity, so the broad masses praise native railways as "roads to happiness." Dock workers in Bengbu City sang:
    "In the past, we carried big bags, now we sit and run,
    With the sound of a whistle, the goods have been transported."
    Workers at the Bengbu Steel Plant sang:
    "Riding the train on the tracks, carrying by shoulder is completely eliminated,
    A full load of ore and coke, is just like a boat floating on the water,
    Blast furnaces don't worry about not having enough to eat, I'm not anxious about rain or snow,
    Produce more steel and iron, to repay the Party's good leadership."
    Now, our province is launching a grand mass movement to run native railways on a large scale, and more native railways are under construction. With the deepening development of the technical innovation movement, the technical level of native railways will continue to improve, and the cost will continue to decrease. In the future sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward, native railways will shoulder a more arduous and glorious transportation task, and the future of native railways is limitless.

    土铁路是幸福之路
    驾着列车轨上跑，肩挑人抬全取消；满车矿石和焦炭，好比船儿水上飘。
    高炉不愁吃不饱，下雨下雪我不焦；增产更多钢和铁，报答党的好领导。
    欧远方代表谈安徽大办土铁路主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念和谭震林三位副总理向大会所作的报告。
    在安徽省1959年持续大跃进中，交通运输战线上出现了一支生力军——土铁路。它虽然出现不久，但对物资运输、节约劳动力、减轻劳动强度等方面起了巨大作用。现在，全省已有不少的矿山、工厂、码头和人民公社，建成了土铁路，有更多的单位正在修建和打算修建。
    土铁路是大跃进的产物，也是党的两条腿走路方针的产物。我省自大跃进以来，工农业生产和各项建设事业飞跃发展，运输量也迅速增长。交通运输事业的发展虽然也很快，但仍然跟不上需要。特别是在钢铁基地、码头、石场、林场、市区以及人民公社与集镇之间等短途运输问题更为突出，有些小高炉常因矿石或煤炭供应不上受到停炉威胁，农副产品的调运也受影响，在这种情况下，能否解决运输问题已成为继续大跃进的关键。省委为了迅速解决这个问题，号召各地本着“两条腿走路”的方针，按照“先易后难，先短后长，先修以煤、铁矿为主的厂矿和物资集中的地区”的原则，试办土铁路。全省各地响应这个号召，各显神通，试制和推广了木轨、竹轨、陶瓷轨等轨道运输方法，代替肩挑人抬，节约了劳动力，提高了工效。就是在这全党全民大办交通运输的高潮中，出现了怀远县红旗人民公社自建的土铁路，这条土铁路对破除迷信、解放思想起了很大作用。接着，又出现了淮南煤矿的一点七公里长、轨重每米二十九公斤、轨距一千四百三十五毫米的土铁路，使用了由汽车改制的机车和自制车箱，效果很好。省里抓住这两件事，在去年4、5月间连续召开两次现场会议，推广他们的经验，从此，土铁路在全省就逐步推开了。现在我省推广的土铁路有三种类型：
    第一种：大型。路基是洋的，轨是用高级铸铁，每米重四十八公斤，能承受二十八吨压力（现在已试验成功可以承受六十吨压力），轨距一千四百三十五毫米，和洋铁路一样宽，可以走大机车，实行土洋接轨，如蚌埠西郊就有这样的土铁路。
    第二种：中型。铁轨也是高级铸铁，每米重二十九公斤，机车有各式各样，汽车改装的可拉一百吨到二百吨，每天能运二千吨。
    第三种：小型。轨用普通生铁铸成，每米重十多公斤，怀远县红旗人民公社就是这种土铁路。
    上述三种土铁路，说它们是土的，是对津浦路这样的洋铁路而言的，就它本身来说，是有土有洋，土洋结合，也是大中小结合，所采用的铁轨不一样，机车也不一样。机车有用煤气机制成的，有用柴油机制成的，有用汽车改装的，还有架线式电动机车。总之，因陋就简，就地取材。现在我省已建设起一座铸轨厂，每天能铸三公里铁轨，铸轨长度也由两米提高到五至八米。
    我省各地在创办和推广土铁路的过程中，遇到不少问题，特别是技术上，设备上和材料上的困难，也碰到一些右倾保守思想的阻挠。但由于坚决执行总路线，和两条腿走路的方针，坚决依靠群众，大搞群众运动，大搞共产主义协作，一切困难和阻碍都被战胜了。怀远县红旗人民公社办土铁路的过程就是一个生动的例子。
    红旗人民公社所创办的土铁路，是安徽土铁路的始祖。这个公社地处淮河边上，在1958年大跃进中就已实现了河网化，战胜了空前大旱，获得空前丰收，粮食平均亩产达八百二十六斤，同时公社又办起了小工厂八百八十六个。在工农业生产大发展之下，运输任务大大增加了，1958年全社总运量达一亿五千多万斤，但是各种运输工具只能完成八千多万斤，余下六千多万斤要靠肩挑人抬，这样全社要占用整劳动力30％，特别是当农忙时节，一面要抢收，一面要抢种，一面又要抢运，庄稼如不能及时运回，就会受到损失，顾了运庄稼又会影响抢种。公社党委第一书记王启后同志提出：治淮时使用的“歪歪车”运土效率很高，能修一条歪歪车道，运输问题就解决了。但没有钢轨怎么办呢？大家提出用生铁来代替。但是谁会制造呢？有人提出补锅匠蒋明知可能对铸轨有点门路。开始蒋明知不敢接受任务，因为他只会补锅、铸犁。党委鼓励他干，他表示试试看。于是社里买了焦炭，又从河滩运来黄沙，架起了补锅用的小炉子和小风箱，用牛屎糊上炉缝，就这样干了起来，经过二十多次反复试验，终于铸成了每米十三公斤的铁轨。后来又用同样的方法，制成了车轮、车轴，按照洋铁路上手压车的原理，制成了手压土机车。这样就鼓舞了大家的信心。试验成功后，公社党委决定正式修筑一条土铁路，但生铁、枕木等材料从哪来呢？公社党委就开电话会议，向干部说明办土铁路的意义，又在群众中广泛宣传动员，发动群众收集废铁、废料。全公社社员热烈响应，结果不到十天，就收集起三十五万斤生铁，二千多斤铜，各种柳、槐杂木、破木条、旧门框、破家具一万多根。他们集中了全社三十二名铁匠，充当铸工，并请曾在治淮中做土方有经验的老社员作指导，就这样铺成了一条从常家坟到淮河边的三公里长的土铁路。从此，红旗人民公社调出调入的大量物资，绝大部分通过这条土铁路运输，大大节约了劳动力。他们还打算再修一条五公里长的中型土铁路，使水路、公路与铁路运输互相衔接，构成一个四通八达的社内运输网，彻底改变社内运输面貌。
    这种勇于克服困难，敢想敢干、自力更生的例子是很多的。再举蚌埠铸轨厂作例子。铸铁轨是兴办土铁路中一个关键问题。我省原来不仅没有铁轨厂和机车车辆制造厂，就连各种配件材料制造的设备也没有。现在九龙岗、蚌埠两个铸轨厂都能成批生产高级铸铁的铁轨，合肥、芜湖、安庆等地也能铸这种铁轨了。在蚌埠铸轨厂建厂之初，什么都没有，就是车学仕、侯乐亭等五个普通搬运工人敢想敢干、白手起家干起来的。他们没有化铁设备，就找来一只破汽油桶制成化铁炉；没有鼓风机，就用手摇木制鼓风机鼓风；没有翻砂设备，就用肥皂厂丢弃的破箱子做砂箱；没有铁和焦炭，就拉着小板车到处收集。就这样没花一个钱把厂子筹备了起来。他们在没有经验的情况下，全靠志大勇为，拜师访友，苦学苦钻，奋战二十多天，终于制出了每米重二十九公斤的铸铁轨，接着又试制成功四十八公斤大型优质铁轨，不久就成批投入生产，这些铁轨已在蚌埠修建土铁路中使用了。
    我省土铁路发展不过一年时间，但土铁路所显示的优越性已非常突出：第一，能就地取材，因陋就简。不但地方可以办，而且人民公社也能办，能充分发挥群众的积极性。第二，投资少，上马快。我省大型宽轨土铁路造价仅为洋铁路的三分之一，小型土铁路更便宜，所以便于迅速推广普及。第三，运量大，成本低。许多钢铁厂修了土铁路，就保证了矿石煤炭的正常供应。如凤阳到林桥一段十三公里土铁路修成后，节省了原来担任这段运输的三十六部汽车，五百辆平板车，七十只五吨木船，日运量由原来一千吨左右增大到二千吨。运费则大大降低了。据蚌埠统计，土铁路每吨公里运费只需要五分到一角钱，仅为汽车运费的三分之一，为平板车运费的八分之一到十六分之一。第四，大大节约了劳动力。每修一公里土铁路即可省一千五百至二千个劳动力，比平板车省四百至五百个劳动力。红旗公社统计，他们使用的四点五马力的机车，每天就节省九万二千个劳动工日。第五，大大减轻了劳动强度，所以广大群众赞扬土铁路是“幸福路”。蚌埠市的码头工人唱道：
    “从前扛大包，现在坐着跑，
    一声汽笛响，货物已运到。”
    蚌埠市钢铁厂的工人唱道：
    “驾着列车轨上跑，肩挑人抬全取消，
    满车矿石和焦炭，好比船儿水上飘，
    高炉不愁吃不饱，下雨下雪我不焦，
    增产更多钢和铁，报答党的好领导。”
    现在，我省正掀起一个规模壮阔的大办土铁路的群众运动，更多的土铁路正在修建中。随着技术革新运动的深入发展，土铁路的技术水平也会不断提高，造价还会不断降低。在今后持续的全面大跃进中，土铁路将担负着更繁重也更光荣的运输任务，土铁路的前途是无量的。
