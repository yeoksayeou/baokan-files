Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd: West German Chancellor Adenauer has concluded his eight-day visit to Japan, departing Tokyo on April 1st to return home.

Before leaving Japan, he and Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke issued a joint communiqué. The communiqué demonstrates that, under the direction of the United States, Japan and West Germany will intensify their collusion to obstruct the easing of the international situation and jointly serve the US's aggressive policies. Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke's joint communiqué is adorned with numerous peaceful phrases, stating that "the common goal of the two countries' policies is to achieve lasting peace on the basis of freedom and justice," that "all international disputes should only be resolved through consultation," and that they "welcome all efforts made by the East and West to strive for a genuine relaxation of tensions." However, the communiqué clearly expresses its opposition to disarmament. The joint communiqué reiterated the US's stance of obstructing disarmament with the so-called "supervision" issue, stating that Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke "affirm that supervised reduction of nuclear and conventional weapons is the most important topic of the upcoming international conference." Prior to this, Adenauer, in a statement to reporters on March 26th, openly emphasized the need to strengthen armaments. He clamored that disarmament can only be achieved through strengthening armaments.

On the German question and the West Berlin question, Kishi Nobusuke expressed support for Adenauer's policy of annexing the German Democratic Republic and continuing to maintain Western military occupation of West Berlin. The communiqué stated: "The Federal Chancellor and the Prime Minister agreed that the reunification of Germany based on the right to national self-determination stipulated in the United Nations Charter and the preservation of the freedom of the residents of Berlin remain the most important issues in Europe."

According to the Associated Press, as a reward for Japan's new support for Bonn, Adenauer promised to help expand Japan's exports to Europe, which is a pressing issue for Japan, which is very willing to do business. The joint communiqué recorded this point, stating that Adenauer expressed that he would "strive to promote trade between the European Common Market and Japan."

In the joint communiqué, Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke also stated that West Germany and Japan would jointly conduct economic expansion into underdeveloped countries. The communiqué stated that the two countries "will further strengthen" "cooperation" in "aid" to underdeveloped countries.

Regarding the strengthening of collusion between Japan and West Germany, the two accomplices of the United States, the communiqué stated: "The heads of the two governments expressed satisfaction with the increasingly close friendly relations between Japan and Germany in recent years." The communiqué also expressed "mutual pleasure" that Adenauer's trip "helped" strengthen the collusion between Japan and West Germany.

    用和平词句掩盖侵略勾结
    阿登纳岸信介发表联合公报
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：西德总理阿登纳已经结束了他在日本的为时八天的访问，在1日下午离开东京回国。
    在离开日本以前，他同日本首相岸信介发表了一项联合公报。公报表明，在美国指使下日本和西德将加紧勾结起来，阻挠国际局势趋向缓和，共同为美国侵略政策效劳。阿登纳和岸信介的联合公报装饰着不少和平词句，说什么“两国政策的共同目标是在自由和正义的基础上实现持久和平”，“一切国际争端应该只通过协商来解决”，“欢迎东西方之间争取紧张局势的真正缓和所做的一切努力”。但是，公报明白表示了反对裁军的立场。联合公报复述了美国的以所谓“监督”问题来阻挠裁军的主张，公报说，阿登纳和岸信介“确认有监督的裁减核武器和常规武器是即将举行的国际会议的最重要的课题”。在这以前，阿登纳在3月26日对新闻记者发表谈话时，曾公开强调要加强军备。他叫嚷只有通过加强军备才能实现裁军。
    在德国问题和西柏林问题上，岸信介表示支持阿登纳要并吞德意志民主共和国和继续保持西方对西柏林的军事占领的政策。公报的说法是：“联邦总理和首相一致认为，根据联合国宪章所规定的民族自决权来重新统一德国和维护柏林居民的自由，仍然是欧洲最重要的问题。”
    据美联社说，作为日本给予波恩这种新支持的报酬，阿登纳保证要帮助扩大日本向欧洲的出口，这对很愿意做生意的日本来说是一个急迫的问题。联合公报写下了这一点，公报说，阿登纳表示他将“努力增进欧洲共同市场同日本之间的贸易”。
    在联合公报中，阿登纳和岸信介还表示西德和日本要共同向不发达国家进行经济扩张。公报说，两国“要进一步加强”对不发达国家的“援助”方面的“合作”。
    关于日本和西德这两个美国的帮凶加强勾结这一点，公报中是这样说的：“两国政府首脑对日德间的友好关系近年来日趋密切表示满意。”公报并对阿登纳此行“有助于”加强日本和西德的勾结“表示共同高兴之意”。
