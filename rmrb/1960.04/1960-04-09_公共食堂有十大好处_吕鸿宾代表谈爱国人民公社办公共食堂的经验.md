Public canteens have ten great benefits
Representative Lü Hongbin discusses the experience of the patriotic people's commune in running public canteens

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I warmly support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

I am from the Aiguo (Patriotic) People's Commune in Ju County, Shandong. Like our brother communes across the country, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, all aspects of our production have achieved continued great leaps forward. I will now report to the conference on the issue of public canteens in our commune.

The entire commune has ninety-three natural villages, ten thousand one hundred and three households, forty-three thousand five hundred and nine people, and one hundred thousand mu of land. Under the correct leadership of the Party and the brilliant illumination of the General Line, with the victory of the people's commune movement and the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, at the urgent request of the broad masses of commune members, canteens were universally established in every village and team in the autumn of 1958. There are a total of ninety-seven canteens, with nine thousand and thirty-eight households participating, accounting for 89.4% of the total number of households, and thirty-nine thousand one hundred and fifty-eight commune members, accounting for 90% of the total population. After the canteens were established, the commune Party committee conscientiously implemented the principle of "actively running them well, voluntary participation, eating with tickets, and savings returned," so that the public canteens developed from having no experience at the beginning to having experience, from being unstable to being consolidated, and gradually developed. Generally speaking, the canteens in the whole commune are good, with seventy-three being permanently fixed, accounting for 75%, and twenty-four being basically consolidated, accounting for 25%. Public canteens have greatly promoted the development of production.

The characteristics of the permanent canteens are: first, they meet the needs of the masses and achieve diversification of food and dishes. According to the habits of the commune members, there are five kinds of food and dishes every day, such as pancakes, porridge, bean paste, peppers, and pickles. There are also several kinds of green vegetables often, and meat and fish are eaten several times a month; second, most of them have established simple restaurants for collective dining; third, the canteens have their own production, have a foundation, and the canteens grow vegetables, raise pigs, process non-staple food, have reserve grain, and also make wild starch and collect dried vegetables, with an average of more than one hundred jin of dried vegetables per person.

Ten Great Benefits

The facts since the establishment of the canteens prove that the people's commune is both the organizer of production and the organizer of life. After the establishment of public canteens, it is convenient for both leadership and production. Specifically, there are ten great benefits:

First, the establishment of public canteens has further consolidated and improved the organization of the people's commune, which satisfies the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members. For example, Zhou Qingzhi and Zhang Lun, poor peasant commune members from Zhoumazhuang, sang praises: "The people's commune is a mountain to lean on, the public canteen is not simple, pancakes, paste, small tofu, peppers, pickles, everything is complete, three meals a day are full, commune members are full of energy, men, women, old and young are laughing happily, and life is infinitely happy, thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership, the establishment of the canteen is an iron rice bowl."

Second, it saves labor and liberates a large number of women from the tedious housework of grinding, milling, burning fire, and cooking. In the past, a family of five had one person cooking; now one person cooks for fifty people, an increase of ten times. In the past, more than ten thousand people cooked, and only one-third of the time was invested in production; now only one thousand and two hundred people cook, freeing up six thousand women laborers to participate in production, becoming the main force in production. For example, in the Zhangjiadangmen production team, out of one hundred and sixty-two households, fifty-five women were often unable to participate in labor because they were busy cooking before the canteen was established, and ninety people could participate in labor for half the time. Now, in addition to the nine people serving in the canteen, the remaining one hundred and thirty-six people participate in labor full-time. The women sang praises: "The commune canteen is really good, women can stand up straight from now on, men and women work together to engage in production, and complete liberation is achieved."

Third, it guarantees working time, improves labor efficiency, and speeds up production and construction. In the past, due to the different times for each household to eat, the gathering time was long, sometimes loose, sometimes tight, especially women, who left late and returned early, at uncertain times, but now they leave early and return late, with everyone present and high work efficiency.

Fourth, it arranges life in a planned way, saving grain and firewood. Canteens generally promote burning coal, which can save 50% to 70% of the firewood compared to individual households using firewood for cooking, which can be used as feed for livestock. Commune members said: In the past, more pots cost more rice, and more stoves cost more firewood; now that canteens have been established, grain and firewood are saved. Public canteens universally promote burning coal, which is both hygienic and economical, changing the past habit of burning firewood, so that the freed-up grass greatly solves the difficulty of livestock feed and promotes the great development of animal husbandry.

Fifth, it strengthens the collective concept of commune members, promotes family harmony and unity, and cultivates a new fashion of respecting the old and loving the young.

Sixth, after the establishment of the canteen, it creates extremely favorable conditions for cooking technology revolution and tool reform. Originally, water was carried on the shoulders, but now more than 50% of the canteens have wells on the spot and use tap water and semi-tap water; from several people per mill and one animal per mill to one animal per multiple mills; originally, vegetables were cut with a knife board and washed with both hands, but now they use vegetable cutting machines and vegetable washing machines; from one person per pot, one pot spoon, and one stove in the past, it has been changed to one person watching three pot spoons, and also changed to Leap Forward pots, return dragon stoves, and turntable pot spoons. Zhu Qin, a poor peasant commune member from Zhujiazhuangzi, happily sang: The Communist Party leads well, the canteen tools are greatly transformed, Leap Forward pot, turntable pot spoon, economical and efficient return dragon stove, cutting vegetables without a knife, carrying water without a shoulder pole, one animal per multiple mills with high efficiency.

Seventh, the five-guarantee households and single men have a backer. They reflected: The people's commune is really good, the old are supported, the young are educated, and there is reliance with public canteens. For example, Zhang Fa, a sixty-nine-year-old man from Zhangjiadangmen, happily said: I am old and alone, and it is difficult to live. I have rice and firewood but worry about cooking. Now I go to the canteen three times a day, and the meals are diverse. I eat as I like and the taste is delicious, which has solved my thirty-year-old worry. Thank you, benefactor Communist Party.

Eighth, with the establishment of good public canteens as the center, various collective welfare undertakings have been greatly developed. There are seventy-eight kindergartens and one hundred and fifty nurseries (groups) in the whole commune, and three children's canteens and seventy homes for the elderly have been established, so that three hundred and fifty helpless elderly people can live a happy old age. Twelve maternity hospitals have also been established.

Ninth, the establishment of good public canteens has promoted the great development of cultural and recreational life. Women have also picked up books while throwing away grinding sticks and picking up hoes. Now, five thousand three hundred and ninety people in the whole commune have invested in learning, three thousand five hundred people have removed the label of illiteracy, and two thousand seven hundred and thirty people have entered spare time middle schools.

Tenth, after the establishment of public canteens, in terms of leadership, it is convenient to understand the thinking of the masses, convenient for leadership, and convenient for guiding the production movement. Once the higher authorities have instructions, they can be promptly made known to every household; going uphill and downhill to work is complete, and there is no phenomenon of sometimes loose and sometimes tight. Commune members no longer ask cadres for firewood and grain. In the past, half of the commune cadres' energy was spent on dealing with the living problems of commune members. After the establishment of the canteen, they were freed from a lot of trivial matters and could concentrate on leading production and doing a good job in production. That is to say, running the canteen well directly promotes production, proving that grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other is completely consistent.

Five Experiences

In the work of running public canteens well, the following issues have been mainly grasped:

First, strengthen the leadership of the Party and adhere to putting politics in command. The commune Party committee conscientiously implemented the principle of "actively running well and voluntary participation," and always adhered to grasping production with one hand and life with the other. Party members, cadres, and members of the Communist Youth League all participated in the canteen. The commune Party committee put forward five requirements for cadres, Party members, and members of the Communist Youth League: (1) integrate with the masses, share weal and woe; (2) set an example and modelly abide by the various systems of the canteen; (3) actively publicize the Party's policies and benefits of running the canteen well; (4) supervise and participate in canteen management, listen to the opinions of the masses, and rely on the masses to run the canteen well; (5) promote the communist style, and together with the masses, carry out the technical innovation movement and reform canteen tools. In the work of running public canteens well, the commune was led by the first secretary, and the secretary and president were each specifically in charge of canteen work. The brigades and production teams each had a secretary and captain in charge of this work, grasping it in the same way as production. At the same time, regular meetings were established from top to bottom (usually once every seven days) to check, evaluate, exchange experiences, set up pacesetters, and carry out the learning, catching up, and surpassing movement. Last year, the commune held nine on-site meetings on running the canteen well, launched a major inspection, major evaluation, and major promotion, and set off a climax of learning from Aiguo Village (You Xi), Zhoumazhuang (Zhou Xi), and Zhujiazhuangzi (Tie Xi) in running the canteen well throughout the commune.

Second, consolidate and establish the leadership advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants, strengthen the leadership of the public canteen, and do everything possible to run the public canteen well to promote production.

Third, rely on the masses, take the mass line, democratically formulate various systems, and implement democratic management. First, the commune and each canteen established welfare committees, promoted democracy, widely listened to the opinions of the masses, decided on major issues, and improved canteen management. Preparations are also being made to convene canteen representative meetings regularly in units of canteens. Second, regularly convene commune member representative meetings or commune member meetings to democratically elect activists from among the poor and lower-middle peasants who are energetic, enthusiastic, willing to work, fair, democratic in style, and trusted by the masses to serve as canteen managers and cooks. Third, regularly publish accounts, achieve daily clearing and monthly settlement, open accounts, wall-mounted systems, and book-mounted accounts, so that the masses understand their own foundation and stabilize people's hearts. Fourth, establish a meticulous grain management system, implement rationing according to the number of people, plan to use grain, eat with tickets, save grain, and return savings. And strictly implement the principle of diligence and thrift, to achieve the purpose of running, consolidating and improving public canteens.

Fourth, the canteen uses its own production to establish a foundation. The whole commune has ninety-seven canteens, collectively planting more than five hundred mu of vegetables (1.2 li per person); the canteens raise one thousand five hundred pigs, averaging about fifteen per canteen; each canteen also raises some poultry and rabbits, reforms some cooking tools, and establishes simple restaurants and some better restaurants, which is convenient for improving life.

Fifth, vigorously carry out tool reform, reduce labor intensity, improve work efficiency, and save a large amount of labor. More than 50% of the public canteens use tap water and semi-tap water; one animal per multiple mills is common in every team, and all use return dragon stoves; turntable pot spoons, others use three pot spoons; and reform vegetable cutting machines and vegetable washing tools. This reduces labor intensity and promotes the development of production. The broad masses of commune members reflected: "Tool reform is really good, saves a lot of labor, and commune members are highly motivated."

In order to further improve and run the public canteen better, so as to promote a new upsurge in production. In addition to fully developing the existing experience, it is planned to unify the basic rations of commune members in the accounting unit and supply them to the canteen on a monthly basis when harvesting grain this year. Commune members eat with tickets and save for themselves. Universally establish dining halls and eat collectively. And further establish a canteen management system, so that the masses truly understand their own foundation, so as to democratically manage the canteen well. At the same time, further mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out tool reform, and universally realize mechanization and semi-mechanization.

    公共食堂有十大好处
    吕鸿宾代表谈爱国人民公社办公共食堂的经验主席、各位代表：
    我热烈拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告和人大常委的工作报告。
    我是山东莒县爱国人民公社的。我社同全国各地兄弟社一样，在党中央、毛主席和中共山东省委的正确领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，各项生产都获得了继续大跃进。现将我社的公共食堂问题向大会作一汇报。
    全公社九十三个自然村，一万零一百零三户，四万三千五百零九人，土地十万亩。在党的正确领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，随着人民公社化运动的胜利，和工农业大跃进，在广大社员的迫切要求下，于1958年秋，村村、队队普遍建立了食堂。共九十七个食堂，入食堂社员九千零三十八户，占总户数89.4％，社员三万九千一百五十八人，占总人口90％。办起食堂后，公社党委认真贯彻执行了“积极办好，自愿参加，凭票吃饭，节约归己”的原则，使公共食堂由初办没有经验到有经验，由不巩固到巩固，逐步发展起来。总的说来，全公社的食堂是好的，常年固定的七十三处，占75％，基本巩固的二十四处，占25％。公共食堂大大促进了生产的发展。
    常年固定的特点是：一、适合群众要求，达到饭菜多样化。根据社员习惯，每天都有煎饼、稀饭、豆沫子、椒子、咸菜等五样饭菜，经常还有几种青菜，每月吃几次肉、鱼；二、一般的都建立了简易餐厅，集体吃饭；三、食堂有了自己的生产，有了家底，食堂种菜、养猪、副食品加工，都有储备粮，还制造野生淀粉和采集干菜，平均每人占有干菜百余斤。
            十大好处
    建立食堂以来的事实证明，人民公社既是生产的组织者，又是生活的组织者。办起公共食堂后，既便利于领导，又便利于生产。具体说来有十大好处：
    第一、办起公共食堂，更加巩固和提高了人民公社的组织，贫农下中农及广大社员满意。如周马庄贫农社员周庆之、张伦等人歌颂：“人民公社是靠山，公共食堂不简单，煎饼糊涂小豆腐，椒子咸菜样样全，一日三餐吃饱饭，社员个个劲冲天，男女老少齐欢笑，幸福生活乐无边，多亏毛主席领导好，办起食堂是铁饭碗。”
    第二、节省劳力，把大批的妇女从推碾、推磨、烧火、办饭等繁碎的家务劳动中解放出来。过去是五口一家，一人办饭；现在是一个人办给五十个人吃，提高十倍。过去万多人办饭，只有三分之一的时间投入生产；而如今只有一千二百人办饭，腾出六千名妇女劳力参加了生产，成了生产上的主力军。如张家当门生产队一百六十二户，未办食堂前因忙于做饭经常不能参加劳动的妇女五十五人，能有一半时间参加劳动的九十人，现在除在食堂服务的九人外，其余一百三十六人全部时间参加劳动。妇女们歌颂道：“公社食堂实在好，妇女从今直起腰，男女同心搞生产，彻底解放达到了。”
    第三、保证劳动时间，提高劳动效率，加快生产建设。过去干活时因各户吃饭早晚不一，集合时间长，七松八紧，特别是妇女由晚出早归，不定时间，变成早出晚归，人齐、工效高。
    第四、有计划地安排生活，省粮省柴。食堂一般都推广了烧煤，比单家独户用柴草作饭可省出50％至70％的柴草做饲草用。社员说：过去是锅多费米，灶多费柴；如今建立了食堂，省粮又省柴。公共食堂普遍推行烧煤，既卫生又节约，改变了过去烧柴的习惯，这样腾出草来，大大解决了牲口饲料的困难，促进了畜牧的大发展。
    第五、加强社员的集体观念，促进社员家庭和睦团结，养成了尊老爱幼的新的风尚。
    第六、办起食堂后，为炊事技术革命和工具改革创造了极为有利的条件。原来吃水用肩挑，现在有50％以上的食堂，就地打井和用自来水、半自来水；由几人一磨和一畜一磨变成一畜多磨；原来切菜用刀板，淘菜用双手，现在用切菜机、淘菜机；由过去一人一锅一?一灶，改变成为一人看三盘?子，还改成了跃进锅、回龙灶和转盘?。朱家庄子贫农社员朱勤高兴的唱道：共产党领导好，食堂工具大改造，跃进锅、转盘?，多快好省回龙灶，切菜不用刀，吃水不用挑，一畜多磨效率高。
    第七、五保户、单身汉有了靠山。他们反映：人民公社真正好，老有养，少有教，办了公共食堂有依靠。如，张家当门六十九岁的张法老大爷喜的说：我年老一人日子难，有米有柴愁做饭。如今一日三时进食堂，饭菜办的有多样，如意吃饭美味香，解除了三十年的老愁肠，感谢恩人共产党。
    第八、以办好公共食堂为中心，促进了各种集体福利事业大发展。全社幼儿园七十八个，托儿所（组）一百五十处，并办了三处幼儿食堂，敬老院七十处，使三百五十名无依靠的老人过着幸福的晚年。并建立妇产院十二处。
    第九、办好公共食堂，促进了文化娱乐生活的大发展。妇女们在扔掉磨棍拿起锄头的同时，也拿起了书本，现在全社已有五千三百九十人投入了学习，三千五百人摘掉了文盲帽子，还有二千七百三十人上了业余中学。
    第十、办起公共食堂后，在领导上来说，便于了解群众思想，便于领导，便于指导生产运动。上级一有指示，就能及时作到家喻户晓；上坡下湖出工齐全，没有七松八紧的现象了。社员没有找干部要柴要粮的了。过去社干部有一半的精力处理社员的生活问题，成立食堂以后，摆脱了不少的繁琐事务，能够集中精力领导生产，搞好生产。也就是说办好食堂直接推动了生产，证明一手抓生产，一手抓生活是完全一致的。
            五条经验
    在办好公共食堂工作中，主要掌握了如下几个问题：
    一、加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。公社党委认真贯彻执行了“积极办好，自愿参加”的原则，始终坚持了一手抓生产，一手抓生活。党员、干部、团员一律参加了食堂。公社党委对干部、党员、团员提出的五项要求是：（1）与群众打成一片，同甘共苦；（2）以身作则，模范地遵守食堂的各项制度；（3）积极宣传党对办好食堂的政策和好处；（4）监督与参加食堂管理，倾听群众意见，依靠群众办好食堂；（5）发扬共产主义风格，同群众一起，开展技术革新运动，改革食堂工具。在办好公共食堂工作中，公社由第一书记挂帅，并确定了书记、社长各一人具体分管食堂工作，大队、生产队都有一书记和队长专管这一工作，和生产同样抓。同时，从上到下建立定期召开会议（一般七天一次），检查评比，交流经验，树立标兵，开展学、赶、超运动。去年公社召开办好食堂现场会议九次，展开了大检查、大评比、大促进，在全社范围内，掀起了学习爱国村（尤喜）、周马庄（周溪）、朱家庄子（铁溪）办好食堂的高潮。
    二、巩固地树立了贫农、下中农的领导优势，加强了公共食堂的领导，想尽千方百计办好了公共食堂，推动了生产。
    三、依靠群众，走群众路线，民主制定各项制度，实行民主管理。第一，公社和各个食堂都建立了福利委员会，发扬民主，广泛听取群众意见，决定重大问题，改进食堂管理。还准备以食堂为单位，定期召开食堂代表会。第二，定期召开社员代表大会或社员大会，民主选举干劲足，热情高，又肯干，办事公道，作风民主，群众所信任的贫农下中农积极分子充任食堂的管理人员和炊事人员。第三，定期公布账目，作到日清月结，账目公开，制度上墙，账目上账，使群众了解自己的家底，安定人心。第四，建立周密的粮食管理制度，实行按人定量，计划用粮，凭票吃饭，节约用粮，节约归己。并严格执行了勤俭节约的原则，达到了办好与巩固提高公共食堂的目的。
    四、食堂用自己的生产，建立家底。全社九十七处食堂，集体种菜五百余亩（每人一点二厘）；食堂养猪一千五百头，平均每个食堂十五头左右；每个食堂还养了一部分家禽和家兔，改革了一些炊事工具，建立了简易餐厅和个别较好的餐厅，这样便于改善生活。
    五、大搞工具改革，减轻劳动强度，提高工作效率，节省大批劳力。有50％以上的公共食堂用上了自来水和半自来水；一畜多磨队队普遍，全部用上了回龙灶；转盘?子，其他是使用的三盘?子；并改制切菜机、淘菜工具。从而减轻了劳动强度，促进了生产的发展。广大社员反映：“工具改革真正好，节省劳力多，社员干劲高又高。”
    为了把公共食堂进一步提高和办得更好，以便促进生产的新高潮。除充分地发扬已有的经验外，打谱今年收获粮食时，将社员的基本口粮统一留到核算单位，按月供应到食堂，社员凭票吃饭，节约归己。普遍建立饭厅，集体吃饭。并进一步建立食堂管理制度，使群众真正了解自己的家底，以便民主管理好食堂。同时，进一步发动群众，大搞工具改革，普遍实现机械化和半机械化。
    以上发言，请各位代表指正。
