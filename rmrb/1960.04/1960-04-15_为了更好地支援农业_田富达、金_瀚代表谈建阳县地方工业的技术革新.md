Comrades Chairman, fellow representatives:

We fully agree with and support the reports made to the Congress by Vice Premiers Li Chunfu, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin. Now, please allow us to talk about the situation of the technological innovation and technical revolution movement in the local industry of Jianyang County, Fujian Province.

Jianyang County is located in the mountainous area of northern Fujian, a good place with superior natural conditions and abundant resources. However, it has historically had a small population and abundant land, with insufficient labor. On average, each laborer has to cultivate ten acres of land and manage twenty acres of forest. With the great leap forward in production and construction, especially after the communization, the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture was implemented, and diversified operations such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries were comprehensively developed, and large-scale farmland capital construction was carried out. Consequently, the labor force felt even more insufficient. In 1959, the county lacked more than 10,000 rural laborers, requiring an increase of 23% based on the original labor force. To fundamentally solve the increasingly tight labor problem in the great development of production, it is urgently necessary to vigorously carry out tool reform and accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture. This situation also put forward new requirements for industrial support to agriculture. However, Jianyang County's industrial foundation is weak, equipment is simple, more than 80% are manual operations, and productivity is very low. According to the industrial task itself, last year it also lacked 2,100 laborers, making it difficult to provide strong support to agriculture. In order to fundamentally solve this contradiction, the Jianyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the slogan of "increasing production without increasing manpower" and "asking tools for labor and innovation for equipment" in May last year. It also established a technical innovation committee from top to bottom, formulating plans at each level, and carrying out the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution in a led, planned, and step-by-step manner.

However, people did not have the necessary understanding of the urgency and possibility of carrying out this movement. At that time, some people in the industrial sector proposed to increase equipment and workers, or reduce tasks and lower targets; some people in the agricultural sector proposed to shut down industry and return labor to the team. The county party committee resolutely criticized this right-leaning thought, and while strengthening propaganda and education to the masses, it focused on the carpentry factory, which mainly produces agricultural tools, to carry out the technical innovation movement, in order to establish a model, gain experience, and comprehensively promote it. Under the direct leadership of the county party committee, the technical innovation of the carpentry factory only took twenty-nine days to abandon the old tools and realize semi-mechanized production. This fact powerfully refuted the right-leaning conservative thinking and promoted the rapid formation of a vigorous mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution. In the past six months, the county's industrial production achieved more than 280 technical innovations, with the efficiency increased from one time to more than one hundred times, equivalent to an increase of 500,000 workdays. At the same time, it produced more than 200,000 pieces of various power machinery, improved agricultural tools, semi-mechanized agricultural tools, and forestry, transportation, cooking, pig raising, and other tools, saving 10,000 laborers for the countryside, and achieving a comprehensive great leap forward in production.

At the beginning of this year, the county's production showed a good situation of continued leap forward: industrial production achieved a "good start," and farmland capital construction and spring plowing preparation were done better than in any previous year. Although the technical innovation and technical revolution movement also continued to move forward, new right-leaning complacency emerged. Some people think that "last year was almost done, there is nothing to do this year," "last year, we engaged in a year of indigenous equipment, and this year we will engage in foreign equipment," and some departments (such as commerce) believe that "innovation is a matter for factories, and there is nothing to innovate in trading," and so on. In order to overcome these ideological obstacles and further develop the movement, the county party committee called on the whole county to launch a major publicity, mobilization, visit, and debate, and put forward a new goal of "quickly eliminating manual operations and achieving mechanization before May 1st." The secretary of the county party committee in charge of industry personally stayed in the winery and worked with the factory leaders and workers to focus on the heavy physical labor of transportation (accounting for 40% of the factory's labor) and the weaknesses of low alcohol yield and high cost. As a result, it only took more than twenty days to eliminate heavy physical labor and realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of brewing production, reducing the cost per ton of alcohol by 35%. The winery's experience was quickly promoted to all walks of life, and thirteen industries and fifty-three types of work such as machinery, papermaking, leather, hardware, brick and tile, and textiles also quickly realized mechanization and semi-mechanization in the technical innovation. Technical innovation in commercial departments and service industries also saw unimaginable miracles in the past, such as automatic payment for newspapers and stamps and making public telephone calls, as well as selling rice and oil without scales, and restaurants serving dishes without people, and cutting vegetables without hands. The development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement not only improved tools and equipment, but also enabled more rational use of raw materials, and even waste materials can be utilized. This year, the county has used rice bran, bean cake, sugarcane residue, cassava, etc. to make 45 new products such as monosodium glutamate, alcohol, engine oil, fiberboard, native paper, and food. The monosodium glutamate workshop of the winery solved the major problem of hydrochloric acid waste gas recovery, which not only allows the recovered hydrochloric acid to be reused, but also ensures the health and safety of workers. During this period, the county party committee also organized factories throughout the county to cooperate with the commune to vigorously engage in hydraulic power processing mechanization and semi-mechanization based on the fact that agricultural and sideline product processing and transportation occupy a large amount of labor in rural areas. Within one month, 208 hydropower stations (1,800 horsepower) were built, making it possible for the brigades to basically realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of agricultural and sideline product processing; more than 6,000 new vehicles were built, and with the original ones, the county basically realized transportation vehicle and boat. In the two months of this year, the county has achieved more than 2,200 major and minor innovations, created and modified 244 various indigenous machines, and built 18 semi-automatic lines, so that 81.1% of the 105 factories in the county and commune industries have basically realized mechanization, semi-mechanization, or semi-automation, and 75% of the workers have been freed from heavy physical labor. Many manual and technically complex types of work, such as planing wood, oil umbrellas, splitting bamboo, and making bamboo shoots, have become very simple procedures due to the use of machinery. Even women who have just entered the factory can master the technology and operate independently, thus freeing up more male labor to strengthen other production fronts. For example, in the grain processing industry, 63 male laborers were transferred to support the technological transformation of agriculture. Recently, the industrial sector provided more than 4,800 pieces of agricultural machinery such as power machines, processing machines, drainage and irrigation machinery, deep plowing, sowing, and transplanting, which also greatly improved agricultural production conditions and labor conditions.

In the movement, the Jianyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China has always adhered to the idea of continuous revolution as the guiding ideology of the movement, and at the same time resolutely implemented the policy of relying on the masses, self-reliance, indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, using foreign methods if possible, and using indigenous methods if foreign methods are not possible, and solved various difficulties with indigenous methods and poor methods. They made full use of the rich wood and bamboo in the mountainous area to make a large number of indigenous machines and indigenous equipment (the conveyor belt of the winery was woven from bamboo strips). More than 90% of the machinery and equipment manufactured in the county's innovation were made of wood instead of iron and iron instead of steel. These machines and equipment have been continuously improved and enhanced with the deepening of the movement. The fiberboard workshop of the spice chemical plant improved various indigenous equipment and realized the entire process of mechanization from pulping, cutting, to preheating.

When technical innovation and technical revolution achieved results, the county party committee paid timely attention to handling the new situations and new problems that followed, so that the movement could develop forward more fully and healthily. Due to the realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization, productivity has been greatly developed, and production efficiency has been multiplied. Therefore, labor organization, enterprise management, and wage quotas must be adjusted accordingly, and the saved labor force should also be properly arranged; at the same time, with the increase in the output of industrial products and the expansion of the scope of production, rural areas need to supply more raw materials. The county party committee reasonably adjusted the labor organization according to the situation of various departments and industries, and transferred more than 300 laborers to support the newly built mines and fiberboard factories, and also organized a group of technical forces to support the "four modernizations" of agriculture. To solve the problem of raw material supply, a method of closely combining with the development of diversified economy in rural areas was adopted, overall planning was made, and various light industrial raw material bases were widely established (this year, the county plans to establish 18,000 mu of raw material production bases); and each factory and enterprise was required to universally "link up" with rural areas, each contracting a brigade, in order to better strengthen worker-peasant cooperation and mutual support. Since the eighteen factories and mines under the county have been "linked up" with the brigades this year, they have produced various machinery and agricultural tools to support the technological transformation of agriculture and support poor teams to catch up with rich teams according to the needs of the brigades; on the other hand, they have also obtained raw material supply from the production brigades according to their own needs. In this way, the collective economy can be rapidly expanded and the income of commune members can be increased, and the requirements of industrial development can be met, so that the worker-peasant alliance has been further consolidated and developed on a new basis.

    为了更好地支援农业
    田富达、金　瀚代表谈建阳县地方工业的技术革新主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意和拥护李春富副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理等向大会所作的报告。现在，请允许我们谈谈福建省建阳县地方工业开展技术革新和技术革命运动的情况。
    建阳县在闽北山区，是个自然条件优越、物产十分丰富的好地方。但历来是人少地多，劳力不足，平均每个劳力要耕种十亩土地和经营二十亩山林。随着生产建设的大跃进，特别是公社化以后，实行工农业并举，全面发展了农、林、牧、副、渔等多种经营，和进行大规模的农田基本建设，因而劳力更感不足。1959年全县缺少农村劳力一万个以上，即要求按原有的劳动力增加23％。要解决生产大发展中劳力日益紧张的问题，就迫切地需要大搞工具改革，加快进行农业的技术改造。这种情况对工业支援农业也提出了新的要求。但是建阳县工业基础薄弱，设备简陋，80％以上都是手工操作，生产率很低，按工业本身任务计算，去年也缺少劳力二千一百个，因而很难给农业以有力的支援。为了从根本上解决这个矛盾，中共建阳县委在去年5月间就提出“增产不增人”、“向工具要劳力，向革新要设备”的口号，并自上而下成立了技术革新委员会，层层制定方案，有领导、有计划、有步骤地开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。
    但是，人们对于开展这一运动的迫切性和可能性，并未具有必要的认识。当时在工业方面有人提出要增加设备和工人，或者减少任务、降低指标；农业方面有人提出要工业下马、劳工归队。县委坚决批判了这种右倾思想，并在加强对群众进行宣传教育的同时，抓住以生产农具为主的木器厂为重点，开展技术革新运动，以树立标兵，取得经验，全面推广。在县委的直接领导下，木器厂的技术革新只花二十九天时间，就抛掉了旧工具，实现了半机械化生产。这一事实有力驳斥了右倾保守思想，促使技术革新和技术革命迅速形成了蓬蓬勃勃的群众运动。在去年半年多的时间中，全县工业生产的技术革新达到二百八十多项，工效分别提高了一倍到一百多倍，相当于增加了五十万个劳动日；同时生产了各种动力机械、改良农具和半机械化农具以及林业、交通、炊事、养猪等工具二十多万件，为农村节约了一万个劳动力，获得了生产全面大跃进。
    今年一开始，全县生产又出现了继续跃进的大好形势：工业生产实现了“开门红”，农田基本建设和备耕工作做得比以往任何一年都好。技术革新和技术革命运动虽然也在继续向前发展，但却产生了新的右倾自满情绪，有人认为“去年搞得差不多了，今年没什么好搞”、“去年搞了一年土设备，今年要搞洋的”，有的部门（如商业）则认为“搞革新是工厂的事，做买卖没什么好革新”等等。为了克服这些思想障碍，使运动进一步开展起来，县委号召全县展开大宣传、大发动、大参观、大辩论，并提出了“迅速消灭手工操作、‘五一’前实现机械化”的新的奋斗目标。县委管工业的书记亲自住到酒厂，和该厂领导及工人一起，针对该厂占劳力最多的运输（占全厂劳力40％）这一繁重的体力劳动和出酒率低、成本高这一薄弱环节，集中力量猛攻。结果只二十多天时间就消灭了繁重的体力劳动，实现了酿造生产机械化、半机械化，使每吨酒精的成本降低了35％。随即把酒厂的经验迅速推广到各行各业，机械、造纸、皮革、五金、砖瓦、纺织等十三个行业、五十三个工种，也很快地在大搞技术革新中实现了机械化、半机械化。商业部门和服务性行业的技术革新也出现了自动付钱买报、买邮票和打公用电话，以及卖米卖油不用秤、饭馆送菜不用人、切菜不用手等过去想像不到的奇迹。技术革新和技术革命运动的开展，不仅是改进了工具和设备，而且使原料得到更加合理的利用，甚至废料也可利用。今年来全县就利用米糠、豆饼、甘蔗渣、木薯等制成了味精、酒精、机油、纤维板、土纸和食品等四十五种新产品。酒厂味精车间解决了盐酸废气回收的大难题，不仅回收的盐酸可以重新利用，更保证了工人的健康和安全。在这期间，县委还根据农副产品加工和运输在农村占用大量劳力的情况，组织全县工厂配合公社大搞水力动力加工机械化、半机械化，在一个月内就建成了二百零八处水力站（一千八百马力），使各大队基本实现了农副产品加工机械化、半机械化；还新造了六千多部车子，加上原有的，全县基本实现了运输车船化。今年的两个多月中，全县共实现了大小革新两千二百多项，创制和改制各种土机械二百四十四台，建成半自动线十八条，使全县县社工业的一百零五个工厂中，已有81.1％，基本实现了机械化、半机械化或半自动化，75％的工人已摆脱了繁重的体力劳动。许多手工操作技术复杂的工种，如刨木、油伞、破篾、打笍等，由于使用了机械，现在已变成十分简单的工序，连刚进厂的妇女都能掌握技术，独立操作，因而就腾出了更多男劳力去加强其它生产战线。如在粮食加工业中就抽出了六十三个男劳力去支援农业的技术改造。最近工业部门提供了农业所需要的动力机、加工机、排灌机械、深耕、播种、插秧等农业机具四千八百多件，也大大改善了农业生产条件和劳动条件。
    在运动中，中共建阳县委始终坚持以不断革命的思想作为运动的指导思想，同时坚决贯彻依靠群众，自力更生，土法上马，土洋结合，能洋就洋，不能洋就土的两条腿走路的方针，用土办法、穷办法解决了种种困难。他们充分利用山区富有的木材、毛竹，制出了大量的土机器、土设备（酒厂的传送带就是用竹篾编成）。全县革新中制造的机械和设备，90％以上都是以木代铁、以铁代钢制成的。这些机械和设备，随着运动的深入发展，又得到不断的改进和提高。香料化工厂的纤维板车间，把各种土设备加以改进后，实现了从打浆、切料到预热的全程机械化。
    当技术革新和技术革命取得成效时，县委又及时注意处理了随之而来的新情况和新问题，使运动更加饱满更加健康地向前发展。由于实现了机械化、半机械化，生产力大大发展，生产效率成倍提高，因而劳动组织、企业管理、工资定额等都必须作相应的调整，对节省下来的劳力也应给妥善安排；同时，随着工业产品产量的增长和生产范围的扩大，又需要农村供应更多的原料。县委根据各部门各行业的情况，合理地调整了劳动组织，抽出了三百多个劳力支援新建的矿山和纤维板厂等厂矿，还组织了一批技术力量支援农业“四化”。对原料供应问题，采取了与农村发展多种经济密切结合的办法，统筹安排，广泛建立各种轻工业原料基地（今年全县计划建立原料生产基地一万八千亩）；并要求各工厂企业普遍与农村“挂钩”，各自包干一个大队，以便更好地加强工农协作和相互支援。县属的十八个厂矿企业今年来分别与大队“挂钩”后，一方面根据大队的需要，生产各种机械和农具，支援农业的技术改造，支援穷队赶富队；另一方面也根据本身的需要，从生产大队取得原料供应。这样，既可迅速扩大社有经济和增加社员收入，又能满足工业发展的要求，从而使得工农联盟在新的基础上得到了进一步巩固和发展。
