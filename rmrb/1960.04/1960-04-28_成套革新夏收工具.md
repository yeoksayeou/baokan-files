    Complete Renovation of Summer Harvest Tools

    "Seize the time ahead of the farming season, prepare sharp tools for the summer harvest," many regions are intensifying their efforts to create new summer harvest tools under this slogan. This matter is extremely important. This year's summer harvest crops, due to being planted more, planted better, and managed well, are growing better than any previous year. However, to get the fruits of the great harvest into our hands, in addition to continuing to strengthen field management, it is also necessary to prepare for the summer harvest, especially to prepare tools. This is the material guarantee for a good summer harvest.

    Completely renovating summer harvest tools is a new requirement for this year's summer harvest work. With the rapid development of the tool reform movement, more and more new summer harvest tools have been used in the past two years. However, generally speaking, these new tools still only account for a very small proportion, and many regions still basically use old-fashioned tools. The summer harvest period is the busiest season. Field management of autumn crops enters the busy season, and summer planting is closely linked to summer harvest. In addition, this year's summer harvest crop acreage has increased significantly, which inevitably leads to a large increase in summer planting area. If the summer harvest is not timely, it will not only affect the summer harvest but also hinder the smooth progress of summer planting. In particular, large-scale high-yield summer harvest crop areas have been established everywhere this year, which has greatly increased the task of summer harvest work. In previous years, the harvest of summer crops required harvesting each ripe area as it ripened. Although the task was not light, it was relatively easy. Because a field was only a few mu or tens of mu. This year is different. In the high-yield areas, generally hundreds of mu, thousands of mu, or even tens of thousands of mu of crops ripen at the same time. If the harvesting and transportation are not timely, there will be great losses. These are all new problems in this year's summer harvest. The task is arduous, and the situation is pressing. We must comprehensively reform summer harvest tools and adopt a large number of efficient semi-mechanized tools and improved tools to complete the summer harvest work quickly and well.

    The so-called comprehensive reform is to renovate the entire set, and to realize the semi-mechanization and improved tooling of the summer harvest work from harvesting and transportation to threshing. In the tool reform movement over the past two years, many excellent semi-mechanized tools and improved tools have been produced. Now it is necessary to quickly test, finalize, manufacture, and promote them in large quantities. New tools that are being researched and created also need to be researched and trial-produced quickly. In short, we must make full use of the achievements of local and foreign tool reforms, match various new tools as much as possible, and comprehensively promote them so that they can exert their due power in the summer harvest. Of course, this does not mean that in preparing summer harvest tools, only semi-mechanized tools and improved tools are needed, and no old-fashioned tools are needed at all. Old-fashioned tools (such as sickles) cannot be completely eliminated now, but some backward operating methods (such as human carrying and human transporting) can be completely eliminated as long as they are vigorously reformed (such as realizing vehicle transportation). Each commune should do its best to increase the operating ratio of new tools and use more semi-mechanized tools and improved tools to replace heavy manual labor as much as possible.

    When comprehensively renovating summer harvest tools, it is necessary to study and solve certain new problems arising from the tool reform as soon as possible. For example, the labor organization needs to be adjusted earlier to adapt to the needs of semi-mechanized operations when using new tools in complete sets. Also, the threshing grounds in some places are very small and scattered, which is not suitable for the centralized operation of various new tools, and the grounds need to be expanded and concentrated, and so on. The more prepared these problems are and the more meticulous they are done, the greater the effect of the summer harvest tool reform will be.

### 成套革新夏收工具

    成套革新夏收工具
    “抢在农时前面，备好夏收利器”，许多地区正在这个口号下加紧创制夏收新工具。这件事非常重要。今年的夏收作物由于种得多、种得好、管得好，生长情况胜过以往任何一年，但是把大丰收的果实拿到手，除了继续加强田间管理以外，还要做好夏收准备工作，特别要作好工具准备，这是收好夏收作物的物质保证。
    成套地革新夏收工具，是今年夏收工作的新要求。随着工具改革运动的迅速发展，近两年中使用的新式的夏收工具越来越多了，但是，从总的说来这种新工具还只占很小的比重，许多地区仍然基本上使用旧式工具。夏收期间是最忙的季节，大秋作物田间管理进入忙季，而夏种又与夏收紧密衔接，加上今年的夏收作物收获面积增加很多，随着而来的必然是夏播面积的大量增加，夏收如果不及时，不但要影响夏季收成，还会妨碍夏种工作顺利进行。特别是今年各地都建立了大面积的夏收作物丰产方，这也大大加重了夏收工作的任务。往年对夏收作物的收割是要求做到熟一片收一片。虽然任务也不轻，毕竟还是比较容易的。因为一块田地不过几亩或几十亩。今年就不同了，在丰产方里，一般都是几百亩、几千亩以至于几万亩的庄稼一齐成熟，如果收割和运输不及时，就会遭受大损失。这些都是今年夏收中的新问题。任务艰巨，形势逼人，必须全面地改革夏收工具，大量采用效率高的半机械化工具和改良工具才能又快又好地完成夏收工作。
    所谓全面改革，就是成套地改革，尽量使夏收工作从收割、运输到打场这一系列的工序实现半机械化和改良工具化。两年多以来的工具改革运动中，已经产生了很多优良的半机械化工具和改良工具，现在需要赶快通过试验、定型，大量制造、推广；正在研究创造中的新工具，也需要加紧研究试制。总之，要充分利用本地和外地工具改革的成果，把各种新工具尽量配套，全面推广，使它们在夏收中发挥应有的威力。当然这不是说在准备夏收工具中，只要半机械化工具和改良工具，一点不要旧式工具了。旧式工具（例如镰刀）现在还不能完全消灭，但是有些落后的作业方式（如人背、人挑的运输方法）只要大力革新（例如实现车子化），是完全可以消灭的。每个公社都应当尽最大力量增加新工具的作业比重，尽量用更多的半机械化工具和改良工具去代替笨重的手工作业。
    在全面革新夏收工具的时候，需要及早研究解决随着工具改革而来的某些新问题。例如，成套使用新工具，劳动组织需要早些加以调整，以适应半机械化作业的需要。又如，有些地方的打谷场院地很狭小、分散，不适于各种成套新工具的集中作业，需要把场院加以扩大、集中，等等。这些问题越是早作准备，越是做得细致周到，就越能使夏收工具改革获得巨大的效果。
