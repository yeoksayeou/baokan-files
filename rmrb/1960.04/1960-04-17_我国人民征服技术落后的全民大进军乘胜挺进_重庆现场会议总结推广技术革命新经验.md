Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 16th: The situation at the National On-Site Conference on Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution in Chongqing shows that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, is developing deeply and extensively with the force of a thousand troops and the speed of lightning, along a correct, scientific, and mass-based path. The situation reflected at the on-site conference also indicates that this movement is no longer just conducting general and individual technical innovations, but is of a comprehensive technical transformation nature, declaring that our people's all-out march to conquer technological backwardness has begun.

The on-site conference was jointly convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. It opened on March 25 and closed on April 7.

A total of 1,546 representatives attended this on-site conference, coming from large, medium, and small cities, large, medium, and small enterprises, and various sectors such as finance, trade, culture, and education in 27 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country.

During the conference, the representatives listened to a report by Ren Baige, First Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, on the comprehensive development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the "Four Modernizations" in Chongqing, and a supplementary report by Lu Dadong, Secretary of the Municipal Committee. They visited the site in detail, unanimously praising the great enthusiasm and spirit of Chongqing's Party and people in carrying out this movement, with excellent and outstanding achievements, rich and comprehensive experience, and a straight upward trend in production. They expressed their intention to learn and promote Chongqing's experience well. The conference reported on the tremendous achievements of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement across the country, and widely exchanged successful experiences in carrying out the movement. The representatives unanimously believed that the on-site conference will enable various successful experiences to be rapidly promoted throughout the country, blossoming everywhere, and pushing the high tide of the movement to a new peak. During the conference, many representatives could not wait and continuously sent important information, experiences, and materials learned from the visit back by telephone, telegram, and letters.

Judging from the situations exchanged by representatives from all over the country at the meeting, the development of this movement is like a storm, sweeping across every corner of the country in a short period. This great mass movement is rapidly changing the face of China's production technology, making China's production and construction continue to leap forward, and enabling thousands of enterprises to complete and over fulfill their production plans for the first quarter ahead of schedule. Throughout the country, whether in large or small cities, large or small enterprises, the degree of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation has been greatly improved, liberating many workers from heavy manual labor and manual operations, and significantly increasing labor productivity. Many regions have seen a new situation of "one person replacing several people, one machine replacing several machines, one factory replacing several factories," achieving increased production without increasing manpower, and even increasing production while reducing manpower. From December last year to March this year, the degree of mechanization in Chongqing has greatly improved, saving more than 80,000 workers in the city. Workers and masses in various regions have also achieved remarkable results in carrying out technical innovations around the issue of raw materials, materials, and fuels. Taiyuan City comprehensively carried out a "one-dragon" movement for the use of raw materials and materials, significantly increasing the utilization rate of raw materials and materials. In Guangzhou's Nanqu District, factories extracted or produced more than 100 kinds of products from waste gas, waste liquid, and other raw materials and materials in just over half a month. This great mass movement has brought about extremely profound changes in the mental outlook of workers and the entire people in our country. The revolutionary consciousness and pioneering spirit of the broad masses of working people have risen to an unprecedented level, with everyone using their brains and hands, forgetting to eat and sleep, and becoming obsessed with innovation. They resolutely eliminated superstition and feelings of inferiority, and their thinking became more liberated. In the movement, the communist style of the broad masses of workers has been further developed, with comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, helping the backward, rushing to take on difficulties, and giving conveniences to others becoming a social trend and a communist moral standard.

In order to make the movement develop forward wave after wave along a correct, scientific, and mass-based path, the conference pointed out that the following main issues should be given great attention at present.

First, under the leadership of the Party, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously carry out mass movements. The practice in many regions has proved that ideological revolution is the driving force of technical revolution, and the process of technical revolution is also the process of ideological revolution. Therefore, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously grasp ideological revolution. At the same time, it is necessary to organize the masses on a large scale to carry out various forms of labor competition, so that the movement can unfold more magnificently on a national scale.

Second, in accordance with the needs of production development, formulate plans, organize battles, and set off climaxes. The experience of many regions has proved that carrying out large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution must sort out the weak links and key issues in current production, conduct comprehensive planning, and guide the spearhead of the mass movement to breaking through key and weak links in production. At present, the main tasks are to vigorously increase the production of raw materials and materials, comprehensively utilize and conserve and substitute raw materials and materials, and solve transportation problems. In realizing the plan, the method of organizing battles, fighting in batches, and completing tasks on a regular basis has been very effective. Each battle has a clear "attack" focus, concentrating superior forces to fight "annihilation battles," achieving victory, attacking one key point, and then attacking the next key point. Before each battle, conduct serious investigation and assessment, careful deployment, and in-depth mobilization; after the battle, conduct timely summary and inspection, and carry out evaluation. While carrying out one battle, actively prepare for the next battle.

Third, systematically summarize, promote, and improve advanced experiences. Experience has proved that matching the innovative creations and advanced experiences of the masses in the movement into a complete set and universally promoting them in all applicable places is of great significance for promoting the in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, consolidating and expanding the results of the movement. Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory has summarized 721 complete sets of experience, compiled more than 120 kinds of technical materials, and summarized and promoted more than 6,000 advanced experiences. Now the factory has established a regular summary and matching system, so that new experiences are promptly identified and incorporated into operating procedures. As a result of continuously consolidating and expanding the results of the movement, the factory's production capacity has quickly increased by 51%.

Fourth, actively innovate old products and develop high-quality, large-scale, sophisticated, cutting-edge, and new products. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, workers in various regions have carried out many innovations to the old products originally produced; at the same time, many new technologies have emerged. Therefore, the departments that manufacture these old products can no longer produce according to the original pattern, and must widely absorb the innovative suggestions and new technologies of the masses to actively innovate old products. While innovating old products, various departments must also vigorously develop high-quality, large-scale, sophisticated, cutting-edge, and new products to raise the equipment of various sectors of the national economy to a higher level. In order to better achieve the above tasks, many departments, especially mechanical departments, should quickly break through weak links such as casting, forging, welding, and transportation, and transform the manual operation of casting, forging, welding, and transportation into mechanical operation. Those that have already achieved mechanical operation should continue to improve the level of mechanization, so that the production technology level of the entire mechanical system can leap forward.

Fifth, it is necessary to promptly solve new problems arising in the movement with the development of the movement. Such as timely improving enterprise management, adjusting labor organization and production organization, improving product design according to the innovation and creation of the masses, etc. At present, the improvement of enterprise management work should focus on three aspects. First of all, the business work of enterprise functional departments must vigorously carry out mass movements, and the cadres of the departments must firmly establish the ideological style and working methods of serving production, serving the central work, and serving the mass movement; it is necessary to closely combine professional management with worker management. It is necessary to better implement the three-combination working method. Secondly, it is necessary to continue to consolidate and improve the system of workers participating in management, and constantly rectify and strengthen worker management groups with the development of the movement, and strengthen the ideological education and business training of worker administrators. Third, it is necessary to create management work methods suitable for the Great Leap Forward needs to adapt to the development of productive forces and the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

In addition, it is necessary to vigorously grasp the scientific, technological, and cultural learning of workers and the masses.

The conference believes that in the process of the technical revolution movement, it is also necessary to vigorously carry out the mass movement to support agricultural technological reform. It is also necessary to actively help urban people's communes carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, so that the industry run by the communes can develop more rapidly.

Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Chen Gang, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhang Youxuan, Deputy Director of the State Scientific and Technological Commission, Rao Bin, Deputy Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, Liang Buting, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and other responsible comrades attended the conference. Liu Ningyi, Zhang Youxuan, Liang Buting, and Rao Bin gave reports at the meeting successively. (Attached photo)

    我国人民征服技术落后的全民大进军乘胜挺进
    重庆现场会议总结推广技术革命新经验
    据新华社重庆16日电　全国技术革新、技术革命重庆现场会议上的情况表明，以机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，正以千军万马、迅雷不及掩耳之势，沿着正确的、科学的、全民的道路深入广泛的发展，现场会议上反映的情况也表明，这一次的运动已经不是进行一般的和单项的技术革新，而是带有全面技术改造的性质，它宣告我国人民征服技术落后的全民大进军已经开始了。
    现场会议是中华全国总工会、第一机械工业部、共青团中央委员会联合召开的。3月25日开幕，在4月7日闭幕。
    参加这次现场会议的代表共计一千五百四十六人，他们来自全国二十七个省、市、自治区的大中小城市，大中小企业和财贸、文教等各行各业。
    会议期间，代表们听了中共重庆市委第一书记任白戈作的关于重庆市全面开展以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动的报告和市委书记鲁大东作的补充报告，详细参观了现场，一致赞扬重庆市党和人民开展这一运动的干劲钻劲很大，成绩优秀出色，经验丰富全面，生产直线上升，表示要很好学习和推广重庆市的经验。会议汇报了全国各地技术革新和技术革命运动的巨大成就，并广泛交流了开展运动的成功经验。代表们一致认为：现场会议将使各种成功的经验在全国迅速推广，遍地开花，把运动的高潮推向更新的高峰。在会议期间，许多代表已迫不及待，纷纷用电话、电报和信件，把参观学习的重要情况、经验、资料连续不断地发回去。
    从全国各地代表在会上交流的情况来看，这次运动发展真如暴风骤雨，在短期内就席卷全国每个角落。这个伟大的全民运动，使我国生产技术面貌瞬息万变，使我国生产建设持续飞跃上升，成千上万的企业提前和超额完成了第一季度的生产计划。在全国无论是大城市或中小城市，大企业或中小企业，都已大大提高了机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的程度，使很多工人从笨重体力劳动和手工操作中解放出来，并显著地提高了劳动生产率。许多地区出现了：“一人顶数人，一机顶数机，一厂顶数厂”的新局面，做到了增产不增人，甚至增产还减人。重庆市从去年12月到今年3月，机械化程度大大提高，全市节约了劳动力八万多人。各地职工群众围绕着原料、材料和燃料问题大搞技术革新，也取得了显著成就。太原市全面开展原料、材料使用“一条龙”运动，显著提高了原料、材料利用率。广州市南区各厂在半个多月内就从废气、废液和其它原料、材料中提炼或制成产品一百多种。这个伟大的全民运动，使我国职工群众和全体人民的精神面貌起了极为深刻的变化。广大劳动人民的革命自觉性和首创精神空前高涨，人人动脑，个个动手，废寝忘食，革新入迷。他们坚决破除了迷信和自卑感，思想上更加解放。在运动中，广大职工的共产主义风格更加发扬，比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进、抢困难、让方便，已成为社会风尚和共产主义道德准则。
    为了使运动沿着正确的、科学的、全民的轨道一浪高过一浪的向前发展，会议指出目前应当大抓狠抓以下几个主要问题。
    首先，一定要在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。许多地区的实践证明，思想革命是技术革命的动力，技术革命的过程也是思想革命的过程。因此必须坚持政治挂帅，大抓思想革命。同时必须大规模地组织群众开展各种形式的劳动竞赛，使运动更加波澜壮阔地在全国范围内展开。
    第二，要根据生产发展的需要，制定规划，组织战役，掀起高潮。许多地区的经验证明，开展大规模的技术革新和技术革命，必须将当前生产中的薄弱环节和关键问题排队，进行全面规划，把群众运动的矛头引导到突破生产关键和薄弱环节。当前主要是大力增产原料、材料，综合利用和节约代用原料、材料，以及解决交通运输问题。在实现规划中，采取组织战役，分批作战，定期完成的办法，很有成效。每次战役都有明确的“攻击”重点，集中优势兵力打“歼灭战”，获得胜利，攻一个重点，再攻下一个重点。在每次战役以前，认真的调查摸底，周密的部署和深入动员；在战役结束后，及时地总结检查，进行评比。在进行这一个战役同时，为下一个战役积极做好准备。
    第三，系统总结推广和提高先进经验。经验证明，把群众在运动中的革新创造和先进经验配套成龙，并在一切适用的地方普遍推广，对推动技术革新和技术革命运动的深入发展、巩固和扩大运动成果，有极重大意义。重庆建设机床厂已总结出成套的经验七百二十一套，整理出技术资料一百二十多种，并总结推广了六千多项先进经验，现在全厂建立了经常的总结配套制度，做到新经验及时经过鉴定纳入操作规程。由于这样不断巩固和扩大运动成果，全厂生产能力很快提高了51％。
    第四，积极革新老产品，发展高、大、精、尖、新产品。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，各地职工对原来生产的老产品进行了许多革新；同时，出现了许多新技术。因此，制造这些老产品的部门不能再按原样生产，必须广泛吸收群众的革新建议和新技术，来积极革新老产品。在革新老产品同时，各部门还要大力发展高、大、精、尖、新产品，把国民经济各部门的装备提高到更高的水平。为了更好地实现以上任务，许多部门尤其是机械部门应当迅速突破铸、锻、焊、运等薄弱环节，变铸、锻、焊、运的手工操作为机械操作，已经实现机械操作的要继续提高机械化水平，使整个机械系统的生产技术水平飞跃上升。
    第五，必须随着运动的发展及时解决运动中产生的新问题。如及时改进企业管理，调整劳动组织和生产组织，根据群众的革新创造、改进产品设计等。当前改进企业管理工作应着重抓三个方面。首先是企业职能科室的业务工作必须大搞群众运动，科室干部要牢固树立服务于生产、服务于中心工作，服务于群众运动的思想作风和工作方法；要将专业管理和工人管理密切结合起来。要更好地贯彻三结合的工作方法。其次，必须继续巩固与健全工人参加管理的制度，应当随着运动的发展不断整顿与加强工人管理小组，加强工人管理员的思想教育与业务训练。第三，必须创造适合于大跃进需要的管理工作方法，以适应生产力的发展，适应技术革新、技术革命运动的发展。
    此外，要大抓职工群众的科学技术文化学习。
    会议认为，在技术革命运动过程中，还必须大力开展支援农业技术改革的群众运动。还要积极帮助城市人民公社开展技术革新和技术革命，使社办工业得到更快的发展。
    中华全国总工会主席刘宁一、中共四川省委书记陈刚、国家科学技术委员会副主任张有萱、第一机械工业部副部长饶斌、共青团中央书记处书记梁步庭等负责同志出席了这次会议。刘宁一、张有萱、梁步庭、饶斌先后在会上作了报告。（附图片）
