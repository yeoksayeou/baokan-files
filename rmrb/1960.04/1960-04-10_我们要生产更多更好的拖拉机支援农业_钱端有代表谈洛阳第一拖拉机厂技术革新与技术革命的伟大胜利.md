Comrades of the Presidium, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the reports of the three Vice Premiers and the written report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and I will implement them.

Following the Party's anti-rightist, morale-boosting rectification movement last winter, a mass movement for technological innovation and technological revolution, centered on the mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation of manual operations, has been launched on all fronts across the country since the beginning of spring this year. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, the Henan Provincial Party Committee, the Luoyang Municipal Party Committee, and the relevant ministries and bureaus, our Luoyang No. 1 Tractor Factory has also achieved many significant accomplishments in this movement of "two revolutions" and "four modernizations." I will now report on the development of this movement in the No. 1 Tractor Factory for your criticism and instruction.

**Results of the Movement**

First, I will introduce the general situation and results of the movement's development:

After fully going into production on November 1, 1959, the Luoyang No. 1 Tractor Factory, based on the spirit of continuous revolution and deeply implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, immediately called on all employees to engage in technological innovation and technological revolution, aiming to basically reach the design level by the end of the year. After extensive and in-depth ideological mobilization, a magnificent and large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution movement was rapidly launched. In late November, the workers of the stamping workshop achieved automation of feeding and discharging materials for thirty-six punch presses in three days and nights, which ignited the climax of this movement. The good news spread, shaking the entire factory and inspiring the masses. It also received the attention and support of the Municipal Party Committee. The factory's Party Committee immediately convened an on-site meeting, issuing a call to all employees to "learn from stamping, compete with stamping, catch up with stamping," and "comprehensively improve the level of mechanization and advance towards automation," widely and continuously organizing visits and demonstrations, so that the movement quickly formed a high tide of learning, competition, catching up, and helping. This year, it has also put forward the goal of comprehensively breaking through the designed quotas by May 1st and doubling the shift output by October 1st. A factory-wide technological innovation and technological revolution performance competition was organized in late February. During the four months of the movement, the enthusiasm of the workers for innovation has remained very high, and the movement has been developing wave after wave, each wave higher than the last.

Over the past four months, the development of the movement has been comprehensive, widespread, rapid, and healthy. In a short period of time, a situation has emerged where everyone has suggestions, every machine has innovations, no department is left out, and the overall appearance has undergone great changes. During this period, according to incomplete statistics, the factory has put forward more than 73,000 innovation proposals and implemented more than 25,800 of them. Among them, there are more than 4,000 major innovation projects that have increased work efficiency by more than one time, and 356 items, including several cutting-edge projects, have significant promotional value.

Due to the implementation of a large number of innovation projects, the four-month movement has fully demonstrated the great effectiveness of technological innovation and technological revolution:

First, it has powerfully promoted production. Following the early overfulfillment of the 1959 annual plan, this year's "good start" has also been achieved, with the early overfulfillment of the January, February, and March plans. Quality has gradually improved, and the reject rate has gradually decreased. At the same time, good technical conditions have been created for safe production.

Second, production capacity has been greatly increased. Many innovation projects have increased production capacity by multiples, several times, or even dozens of times. According to the statistics of the February technology performance competition, 42% of the mechanical processing parts in the factory have reached or exceeded a doubling of production capacity. According to the statistics of eight workshops, 34 work sections have reached a doubling of capacity, of which four work sections have reached a five-fold increase. Among the parts processed by the engine workshop, 94% have reached a doubling of production capacity.

Third, manual labor and manual operations have been reduced, and personnel have been saved. According to the statistics of 419 projects participated in by twelve units in the February technology innovation performance competition, 330 people can be saved. The stamping workshop saved 177 people.

Fourth, the difficulties of incomplete and insufficient equipment have been overcome. Although our factory has been completed, accepted, and fully put into production, many pieces of equipment have not yet arrived, and some are key equipment. Through technological innovation and technological revolution, and by adopting methods of multi-purpose machines and process reforms, some have been temporarily used as substitutes, and some can be permanently eliminated. For example, after a comprehensive process innovation in the bearing shell section of the engine workshop, the mechanical processing procedures were reduced from nineteen to ten, the output was doubled, and ten pieces of equipment were saved. If these ten pieces of equipment were put into production, the output could be doubled again. In the standard metal parts workshop, the existing number of multi-spindle automatic machines only accounts for two-thirds of the required number. Through technological innovation, by adopting multi-tool and multi-cut methods, the production capacity has approached the original design capacity.

Fifth, materials have been saved, and some material shortages have been overcome. In the heat treatment workshop, due to the adoption of water jacket furnace covers (electric furnaces) and carbon furnace linings (cupola furnaces), a large amount of refractory materials has been saved. The promotion of mud molding has not only greatly improved work efficiency, saved molding area, and improved working conditions, but also saved a large amount of molding sand. According to the statistics of the non-ferrous repair and casting workshop alone, 354 tons of refractory materials and 1,307 tons of molding sand can be saved annually. Due to the realization of innovation to replace forging and punching with casting, and to replace steel with cast steel, according to the statistics of the precision casting workshop alone, 344.9 tons of steel can be saved annually (some of which are valuable alloy steels). The non-ferrous repair and casting workshop has realized the rapid gas cutting method, which can save 3,000 bottles of oxygen throughout the year.

Sixth, safe production has been guaranteed, working conditions have been changed, and labor intensity has been reduced. Due to the large-scale realization of mechanization (semi-mechanization) and automation (semi-automation), not only has production capacity and work efficiency been improved, but also working conditions have been changed and labor intensity has been reduced. Therefore, the production safety of workers has been guaranteed, and employees no longer feel that production is a difficult labor, but consider it a pleasant career. According to a survey by the engine and stamping workshops, they have eliminated accidents of all sizes in the three months since the launch of the "two revolutions." Two old workers in the stamping workshop, one of whom had three fingers crushed by a punch press in the past, and the other of whom had become hunchbacked from fatigue, happily said that after their workshop was fully automated, people engaged in production in this workshop would no longer become disabled. After the realization of automatic charging of cupola furnaces in the cast iron workshop, the workers wrote a couplet on the furnace door to praise their happy mood after being liberated from the struggle with nature. The first line of the couplet is "Laugh at the past when sweat flowed all over the face" (describing their past conditions when they were not very good), and the second line is "Rejoice in the present when the mood is pleasant" (describing their mood after overcoming natural conditions). A bookkeeper in the carpentry workshop created a new calculation method to get rid of the heavy labor, and he wrote a poem to sing about his current working mood: "Multiplication and division become addition and subtraction, calculating accounts does not require an abacus, addition and subtraction are measured with a ruler, the percentage can be found by looking up a table, and you know it in two seconds."

Seventh, the greatest gain lies in: After four months of the movement, the mental outlook of all employees in the factory has undergone great changes. From cadres to workers, from old workers to new workers, the mystical views of technological innovation and technological revolution have been further broken, the confidence and courage in technological revolution have been greatly enhanced, thinking has been further liberated, and they are more daring to think, speak, and act. As some workers said: "The mind is opened up, innovation has become an addiction, the more you innovate, the smarter you become, and the more you innovate, the more energetic you become."

The reason why the four-month movement has developed widely, comprehensively, rapidly, healthily, and continuously in depth is first of all due to the correctness of the Party Central Committee and the leadership of the higher-level Party and government. After the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, especially after the study of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the in-depth rectification of the entire Party, the systematic education of the "Three Red Banners" among all employees, and the continuous anti-rightist morale-boosting campaign, the Party's general line for building socialism has been more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The viewpoint of continuous revolution taught by Chairman Mao has been mastered by the majority of employees, and the majority of employees are more daring to think and act. Secondly, under the encouragement of the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country, especially after the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the instructions that the national economy should be based on agriculture and that the technological transformation of agriculture should be accelerated, this requires us to rapidly increase the production capacity of our factory by multiples or even several times. This good situation and glorious and arduous task, coupled with the powerful enlightenment of the large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution movements across the country, have stimulated the high initiative and creative spirit of the majority of employees. It is precisely because of the above-mentioned political ideology and the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward situation and the requirements for continuing the Great Leap Forward that the large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution movement has developed turbulently, wave after wave.

**Our Experience**

Next, I will introduce some of the experiences of the Luoyang No. 1 Tractor Factory in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement.

The rapid, great, and healthy development of the "two revolutions" movement in the No. 1 Tractor Factory over the past four months, in addition to the encouragement of the Party's general line, we have the following experiences in this movement.

First, strengthen Party leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, boldly mobilize the masses, and launch mass movements on a large scale. For four months, the technological innovation and technological revolution movement has always been the most important item on the agenda of the Party committees at all levels of the No. 1 Tractor Factory. Under the leadership of the Party committee, a "three-way combination" technological innovation and technological revolution committee was organized, and a strong office was established to closely grasp the situation of the movement and strengthen the guidance of the movement. The second is to strengthen the ideological leadership of the movement, boldly and deeply mobilize the masses, continuously oppose rightism, boost morale, continuously liberate the mind, break superstitions, establish a communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, establish the thought of continuous revolution and the spirit of dauntlessness, and timely combine the practice of the broad masses to powerfully criticize all kinds of conservative ideas that are sticking to old ways. At the beginning of the movement, we deeply studied the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, systematically carried out the education of the "Three Red Banners," conveyed the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao that the national economy should be based on agriculture and that the technological transformation of agriculture should be accelerated, discussed the glorious and arduous tasks of our factory in the situation of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, and stimulated the spirit of the broad masses of employees to strive for progress and the consciousness of the Great Leap Forward. We put forward the call to improve the factory's production capacity rapidly, to have everyone make suggestions, to innovate everywhere, and to advance towards the "two modernizations," and criticized the mystification of technological innovation and the theory of conditions. At the beginning of the movement, many people believed that we were a new factory, with advanced equipment, advanced technology, and advanced technological equipment, while the majority of workers were new apprentices recruited from the countryside, and the basic production workshops had just been put into production. The main thing was to learn, the auxiliary workshops were single-piece production, and innovation was difficult or even impossible. The factory's Party Committee seized on these tendencies and organized a critique of the metaphysical viewpoint that "learning" and "innovation" were completely separate and that single-piece production could not be innovated, especially seizing on the fact that the automation of feeding and discharging materials for thirty-six presses in three days and nights in the stamping workshop was pioneered by a second-level young worker, greatly breaking the sense of inferiority and the theory of conditions. After that, we criticized the ideas of liking foreign things and disliking native things, liking big things and disliking small things, aiming too high and being unrealistic, and wanting to make a sensation with a single achievement, looking down on small innovations and being unwilling to engage in small innovations, and put forward the slogan that small innovations can do big things and small reforms can break through big barriers. After the movement was launched and a large number of innovation projects were realized, we criticized the theory of the top of innovation and the theory of limited revolution. Some people believed that the small innovations had been exhausted and there was no more "oil" to be extracted, and that further innovation would be a big innovation, but big innovation was not easy. Others believed that workers could only engage in small innovations, not big innovations, not mechanization and automation, and not cutting-edge technology. In response to this idea, we put forward the idea that "technology has no top, innovation is endless, as long as you use your brain, you can always innovate." In fact, many pieces of equipment and technological equipment have been innovated several times or even dozens of times in a short period of four months. Among the 133 pieces of equipment innovated in the stamping workshop, more than 102 pieces have been innovated more than twice, and seven pieces have been innovated more than ten times. The bearing shell section of the engine workshop has carried out a comprehensive process revolution on the basis of the innovation of each machine and the doubling of output, so that the output has doubled again. This revolution was not smooth sailing. The innovation projects in some workshops had experienced failures for twenty or thirty times or even forty or fifty times, but because the Party and leaders gave them continuous support and encouragement, and gave play to the indomitable spirit of the workers, they finally succeeded. Numerous facts have proved that as long as you have the idea of continuous revolution and revolutionary aspirations, your understanding will gradually deepen in labor practice, and you will be able to continuously innovate on the basis of continuously deepening understanding. Therefore, in the movement, continuously liberate the mind, continuously break superstitions, establish a clear idea of continuous revolution for the broad masses of employees, maintain vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm, and the wisdom of the broad masses of employees can be brought into play endlessly, and the movement can develop continuously and vigorously.

Second, not only have clear goals, but also have comprehensive plans.

This is an important link in realizing centralized leadership of large-scale mass movements. With clear goals and comprehensive plans, the wisdom and strength of the broad masses can be concentrated on the main aspects. At the beginning of the movement, the No. 1 Tractor Factory put forward the goal of basically reaching the design level by the end of last year, and this year put forward the goal of comprehensively breaking through the design quota by May 1st and doubling the shift output by October 1st. The goal of each period is advanced and can be achieved through efforts, which is both concentrated and specific, and can be specific to each piece of equipment, each workstation, and each person. Therefore, it is both hopeful and achievable, and can powerfully mobilize the initiative and enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees. In order to more widely mobilize the masses and improve the purposefulness and consciousness of the broad masses of employees in technological innovation and technological revolution, the factory also put forward the requirements of "one increase" (increase output), "two guarantees" (guarantee quality and guarantee safety), and "three reductions" (reduce physical labor, manual operations, reduce various consumption, and reduce personnel) as specific goals for measuring each innovation. While clarifying the goals, we also formulated a comprehensive plan. This year's plan is summarized in eight sentences, namely: "Put politics in command and establish great ambitions, innovate on every machine and everywhere, in order to double the output on October 1st, achieve one person topping several people, two modernizations, individual, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand (note), realize 100,000 innovations, master 100 new technologies, and have ten technologies reach the cutting edge" (note: one automated workshop, ten automated work sections, one hundred automatic lines or units, one thousand pieces of equipment with single-machine automation or semi-automation, and ten thousand mechanized manual operations). The plan includes not only economic and technical indicators, but also key priority projects (100 new technologies), and also includes requirements that can mobilize the broad masses of employees to actively participate in the movement (innovate on every machine and everywhere, realize 100,000 innovations), so that the broad masses of employees not only have clear action goals, but will not be bound by the plan. In order to achieve the goals of the plan, what direction should the movement go in, what should be innovated, and how should it be innovated? The factory also put forward "two modernizations," "four innovations," and "adding cutting-edge technology" as the general direction of the movement. "Two modernizations" means mechanization (semi-mechanization) and automation (including semi-automation). "Four innovations" means the four major innovations in processing methods, technological equipment, equipment, and products. "Cutting-edge technology" means the research of advanced and cutting-edge technologies. This direction is vast and anyone has a place to use their talents. At the same time, it also put forward a whole set of principles of "five parallelisms," "five sides," and three "three-way combinations."

"Five parallelisms" means: "Combining native and foreign methods, combining large and small methods, combining comprehensive innovation with attacking key points, combining the innovation of production departments with the innovation of auxiliary departments, and combining continuous adoption of advanced technologies with continuous improvement of workers' operating skills."

"Five sides" means: Experimenting, adopting, improving, promoting, and raising simultaneously. As soon as a feasible new suggestion is put forward, it will be experimented with. Under the condition that it is basically successful, it will be used in production, and it will be used and improved in production (revised and supplemented). At the same time, it will be promoted. In the use of more people, concentrate everyone's wisdom, develop it, and improve it.

Three "three-way combinations": One is the "three-way combination" in guiding ideology, that is, combining the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific analysis, combining originality with learning, and combining self-reliance with mutual cooperation. The other is the "three-way combination" in the content of innovation, that is, combining the near and the far, combining technological revolution with scientific research, and combining the innovation of equipment, technological equipment, and technological methods with the innovation of product structure. The other is the "three-way combination" of leading cadres, workers, and technicians. The "three-way combination" of leading cadres, workers, and technicians has played a huge role in this movement. All major projects or complex innovations have been realized through repeated research by the three-way combination group. There are various organizational forms, mainly including (1) fixed three-way combination groups. Workshops and sections are organized at all levels, mainly to guide the technological innovation of their units, help workers, and study and realize innovation suggestions. (2) Three-way combination assault teams. Aiming at key problems, weak links in production, or difficult topics put forward by workers, organize special three-way combination teams to attack and break through. (3) Three-way combination meetings. This is a flexible form that is not fixed in time or content. The meetings can be specialized, professional, or comprehensive. The above three forms of three-way combination constitute the factory's three-way combination network, which not only plays a huge role in technological innovation, but also provides good education to the three types of people in the three-way combination.

Third, exchange and promote learning, competition, catching up, and helping.

In the movement, the factory widely used vivid forms such as on-site meetings, exhibitions, broadcasting, reporting good news, issuing red lists, inserting red flags, and widely organizing visits and demonstrations. The process of the movement is the process of extensive exchange and promotion, learning, competition, catching up, and helping. Between workshops, between work sections, three or two people observe and learn from each other, some worship teachers to learn skills, some send treasures to the door, and some good creations spread throughout the factory overnight. Through extensive mutual exchange and mutual inspiration, a large number of innovation suggestions emerged in batches and sets from points to surfaces. For example, the factory's experience of "small innovations doing big things" started from the fuel system workshop, the automation of feeding and discharging materials for presses was learned from the stamping workshop, and the automation of processes and machine tools was spread from the engine workshop. At the same time, we also continuously organized visits and learning and experience exchanges to other factories and other places, which played a great enlightening and promoting role in the widespread and in-depth development of the movement. For example, the mud-type cast iron in the non-ferrous repair and casting workshop was learned from other places. Not only can the same industry, the same trade, and the same system learn from each other and help each other, but also different industries and different trades can learn from each other and inspire each other. Therefore, the workers have concluded the movement forms of learning, competition, catching up, and helping as follows: "There is no separation between industries, the principles of each industry are interconnected, learn from each other and help each other, exchange widely, three people are better than Zhuge Liang, and the wisdom of the masses converges into a huge torrent."

Fourth, combine self-reliance, mutual cooperation, and necessary material supply.

With the in-depth development of the movement and the introduction of a large number of innovation suggestions, especially the establishment of automatic production lines, a large amount of workload in design, materials, collaboration parts, processing and manufacturing for realizing innovation suggestions has been brought about. If it is not properly and timely resolved, it will affect the continued development of the movement, or it will inevitably lead to a situation where many innovation suggestions are put forward but few are realized. To solve this problem, we have adopted self-reliance and mutual cooperation, with the former as the main method. At the beginning of the movement, we put forward the slogan of creating our own ideas, designing ourselves, manufacturing ourselves, and realizing ourselves, and tried to use waste products and waste materials as much as possible in materials. Therefore, a large number of innovation projects are realized by the masses through self-reliance. It is precisely because of this that the factory was able to realize more than 25,800 innovation suggestions in a short period of four months. Practice tells us that the masses not only have endless wisdom, but also have soaring enthusiasm and unyielding perseverance. Hu Hailiang, who pioneered the automation of discharging materials from presses, made more than 20 parts of the entire discharging device entirely from waste materials. Among them, two racks of more than 600 cm long and more than 200 teeth were also filed by himself with a file with the perseverance of "grinding a steel beam into a needle" using waste materials. While emphasizing self-reliance, it is also necessary to widely organize collaboration, vigorously promote the communist style of collaboration, especially for the realization of some large-scale innovation projects and the establishment of automatic production lines, which requires more materials and a large amount of design and manufacturing workload, it is necessary to organize mutual collaboration throughout the entire work section, the entire workshop, and even the entire factory. For example, the non-ferrous workshop also adopted a lively and vivid form of collaboration. The workshop established a "Unlimited General Company for Supporting Two Modernizations (Mechanization and Automation)," with several "business departments," "waste material collection stations," "material stores," "hardware companies," "transportation stations," and "design institutes" under it. Each work section has established limited collaboration companies and other very lively collaboration organizations according to their own equipment conditions. According to the statistics of only five days, the "waste material collection station" received more than 5,500 kilograms of waste products and sold more than 6,200 kilograms, solving the material problems of more than 6,000 parts. More than 800 people participated in the business activities of each "business department," solving the mechanical processing tasks of more than 8,000 man-hours, which is equivalent to one month's production of the mechanical and power division's two work sections. In addition, some materials and accessories necessary for innovation must also be actively supplied in the spirit of thrift.

Fifth, regularly organizing "performance competitions" is an effective form to promote the movement to move forward wave after wave.

The factory's Party Committee decided to organize five technological innovation and technological revolution performance competitions throughout the year on "March 8th," "May 1st," "July 1st," "October 1st," and "New Year's Day." The first competition has already been held in late February, and we are now preparing to present gifts for "May 1st." The factory plans to use these five competitions to push the movement to a new climax wave after wave.

Our Luoyang No. 1 Tractor Factory is also a newly built factory that has not been put into production for long, and has not much experience. In completing the future work, we will of course encounter many difficulties. In the work of the past few months, we have deeply realized the importance of the Party Central Committee's proposal to take steel as the key link, because steel is our most important material and raw material. After vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, and increasing production capacity by multiples or even dozens of times, our factory is like a hungry and thirsty young man, who needs to eat and drink a lot every day. The contradiction between productivity and material supply has been raised before us and needs to be urgently resolved. Recently, Vice Premier Tan, in his article "Several Issues on Realizing Agricultural Mechanization in Our Country" published in the People's Daily, mentioned that "...the development of our national economy, and the Great Leap Forward in industrial production, have made our country's steel output reach more than 13 million tons in 1959, so it is possible to allocate more steel in 1960 for agriculture than the total amount of steel used for agriculture during the First Five-Year Plan to equip agriculture." Vice Premier Li Fuchun has decided in his "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960" to allocate 1.1 million tons of steel for agricultural machinery and tools, an increase of about 100% compared with 1959. This instruction from the Central Committee has given us great encouragement. Although the technological innovation and technological revolution movement in our Luoyang No. 1 Tractor Factory has just begun, it has shown its great power.

We believe that in the future, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, under the wise leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the higher-level Party and government, and with the vigorous support and care of the people of the whole country, as long as we continue to muster greater enthusiasm, rely on the masses, and continue to work hard in the spirit of continuous revolution, and continue to strive to make the technological innovation and technological revolution movement develop continuously and healthily wave after wave, we believe that it is certainly possible to realize our planned goals ahead of schedule and produce more, better, and newer tractors to support agriculture.

Finally, I wish the conference a success! I wish all representatives good health!

专栏：

    我们要生产更多更好的拖拉机支援农业
    钱端有代表谈洛阳第一拖拉机厂技术革新与技术革命的伟大胜利主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意三位副总理的报告和人大常委会书面报告并贯彻执行。
    继去冬党的反右倾，鼓干劲的整风运动之后，今年入春以来，一个以实现手工操作机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新与技术革命声势浩大的全民运动，已经在全国各个战线上开展起来。我们洛阳第一拖拉机厂的这个“两革”“四化”运动，在党中央、毛主席、河南省委、洛阳市委和部局的领导下，也已经取得了许多重大的成就，现将第一拖拉机厂这一运动的发展情况汇报如下，请批评指示。
    运动的成果
    首先介绍一下运动发展的概况和运动的成果：
    洛阳第一拖拉机厂从去年11月1日全面投入生产后，在深入贯彻党的八届八中全会决议的基础上，本着不断革命的精神，立即向全体职工提出了以年底基本上达到设计水平为目标，大搞技术革新与技术革命的号召。经过广泛深入的思想发动，迅速掀起了一个波澜壮阔、规模浩大的技术革新与技术革命运动。11月下旬，冲压车间职工三昼夜实现三十六台冲床进、退料自动化，是这次运动高潮的燃点。喜报张出，震动了全厂，激发了群众，同时受到了市委的重视与支持。厂党委立即召开了现场会议，向全厂职工发出了“学冲压、比冲压、赶冲压”，“全面提高机械化程度，向自动化进军”的号召，广泛不断的组织了参观表演，使运动迅速形成学、比、赶、帮的高潮。今年又提出“五一”全面突破设计定额，“十一”实现班产量翻一番的目标。2月下旬组织了全厂技术革新与技术革命表演大会赛。在四个月的运动中，广大职工的革新热情一直十分高涨，运动一直是一浪逐一浪，一潮高一潮地向前发展。
    四个月来，运动发展是全面、广泛、迅猛、健康的。在不长的时间内，出现了人人有建议，台台有革新，科室无空白，面貌大改变的局面。在这个期间，据不完全统计，全厂提出革新建议达七万三千多项，实现二万五千八百多项。其中提高工效一倍以上的重大革新项目四千多项，具有重大推广价值，包括若干尖端项目即有三百五十六件。
    四个月的运动，由于大量革新项目的实现，已经充分地显示了技术革新与技术革命的巨大成效：
    第一、是有力地促进了生产。继提前超额完成1959年年度计划之后，又实现了今年的开门红，提前超额完成了元、2月和3月份的计划。质量逐渐提高，废品率逐渐下降。同时为安全生产创造了良好的技术条件。
    第二、是大大地提高了生产能力。很多的革新项目都成倍、数倍以至几十倍的提高了生产能力。据2月技术表演大会赛检阅的统计，全厂机械加工的零件中，已有42％达到或超过了翻一番的生产能力。据八个车间的统计，已有三十四个工部、工段达到了翻一番的能力，其中四个工段已达到翻五番的水平。发动机车间加工的零件中，已有94％达到了翻一番的生产能力。
    第三、减少了体力劳动、手工操作，节省了人员。仅据十二个单位参加2月技术革新表演大会赛的四百一十九个项目的统计，即可节约三百三十人。冲压车间节约一百七十七人。
    第四、克服了设备不全、不足的困难。我们的工厂虽然已经交工验收全面投入生产，但仍缺少很多台设备未到货，而且有些还是关键性的设备。经过技术革新与技术革命，采取一机多用和工艺改革的方法，有些暂时代用了，有的则可永久的省掉了。例如：发动机车间轴瓦工部经工艺的全盘革新，机械加工工序由十九道改为十道，产量翻了一番，还节省了十台设备，如再将这十台设备投入生产，产量则可达到翻两番的水平。标准金属零件车间，多轴自动机现有数仅占需要数的三分之二，经过技术革新采取多刀多切的方法，已经接近原设计的生产能力。
    第五、节省了材料，克服了一些材料不足的困难。热加工车间，由于采取水套炉盖（电炉）、炭素炉衬（冲天炉），大量地节省了耐火材料；由于推广了泥型，不仅大大地提高了工效，节省了造型面积，改善了工作条件，还大量地节省了型砂，仅据有色修铸车间的统计，每年即可节约耐火材料三百五十四吨，型砂一千三百零七吨；由于实现了以铸代锻冲，以铸钢代钢材的革新，仅据精密铸造车间的统计，每年即可节约钢材三百四十四点九吨（其中有些是贵重的合金钢），有色修铸车间，实现了快速气割法，全年可节省氧气三千瓶。
    第六、是保证了安全生产，改变了劳动条件，减轻了劳动强度。由于大量实现了机械化（半机械化）与自动化（半自动化），不但生产能力、工效提高，而且改变了劳动条件，减轻了体力劳动强度，因而保证了工人们的生产安全，使职工们对生产不再感到是一种艰苦的劳动，而是被认为愉快的事业。据发动机与冲压车间的调查，从开展两革后的三个月中，他们已经消除了大大小小的事故。冲压车间有两个老工人，一个是过去曾经被冲压机床压断了三个手指头，一个是累成了驼背，这次他们车间全部实现了自动化之后，他们高兴地说，从此在这个车间里从事生产的人，再不会成为残废了。铸铁车间由于实现了冲天炉加料自动化后，工人们在炉门上写了一副对联，来歌颂他们与自然斗争得到解放后的愉快心情。这副对联的上联是“笑昔日汗流满面”（写他们过去条件还不大好），下联是“喜今朝心情愉快”（写他们战胜自然条件后的心情）。木工车间会计员由于创造了新的计算方法，摆脱了繁重劳动，他写了一首诗来歌唱他现时的工作心情：“乘除法变加减，算账不用算盘算，加减法用尺量，百分比一查表，两秒钟就知道。”
    第七、最大收获还在于：经过四个月的运动，全厂职工的精神面貌有了很大的变化。从干部到工人，从老工人到新工人，都进一步打破了技术革新与技术革命的神秘观点，大大地增强了技术革命的信心和勇气，思想更加解放了，更加敢想、敢说、敢干了。正像有的工人所说的：“脑筋开了窍，革新有了瘾，愈革愈聪明，愈革愈有劲。”
    四个月的运动所以广泛、全面、迅猛、健康、持续深入的发展起来，首先是由于党中央和上级党、政领导的正确，经过1958、1959两年连续的大跃进，尤其是经过八届八中全会决议的学习，全党的深入整风，全体职工中“三面红旗”的系统教育，不断地反右倾鼓干劲，党的建设社会主义的总路线更加深入人心，毛主席教导我们的不断革命论的观点，更为广大职工所掌握，广大职工就更加敢想敢干了。其次，在全国大跃进的形势鼓舞下，特别是党中央和毛主席提出了国民经济以农业为基础，以及加速农业技术改造的指示，这就要求我们必须迅速地成倍地以至数倍地提高我厂的生产能力。这种大好形势和光荣艰巨的任务，再加上全国各地大规模技术革新与技术革命运动的有力启示，激发了广大职工的高度的主动性和创造精神。正是由于有了上述的政治思想和大跃进形势的鼓舞和继续大跃进的要求，大规模的技术革新与技术革命运动就汹涌澎湃地、一潮高一潮地发展起来。
        我们的体会
    其次再来介绍一下洛阳第一拖拉机厂技术革新与技术革命运动的若干体会。
    四个月来一拖两革运动发展迅速，成绩巨大、健康，除党的总路线的鼓舞之外，我们对这一运动有以下的体会。
    第一、加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。四个来月，技术革新与技术革命运动一直是一拖各级党委最重要的议事日程，在党委领导下组织了“三结合”的技术革新与技术革命委员会，成立了强有力的办公室，密切地掌握运动的情况，加强运动的指导。其次是加强运动的思想领导，放手深入地发动群众，不断地反右倾，鼓干劲，不断地解放思想，破除迷信，树立敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，树立不断革命论的思想和大无畏的精神，及时结合广大群众的实践有力地批判形形色色的因循守旧的保守思想。运动开始，深入地学习了八届八中全会决议，系统地进行了“三面红旗”的教育，传达了中央、毛主席国民经济以农业为基础及加速农业技术改造的指示，讨论了我厂在社会主义建设大跃进形势下光荣艰巨的任务，激发了广大职工奋发图强的精神和大跃进的自觉性。提出了为了迅速提高工厂的生产能力，人人提建议，处处搞革新及向两化进军的号召，批判了技术革新的神秘与条件论。运动开始有不少人认为我们是新厂，先进的设备、先进的工艺、先进的工艺装备，而工人大部却是从农村招来的新徒工，基本生产车间刚投入生产，主要是应当学习，辅助车间是单件生产，革新有困难甚至不可能。厂党委抓住这些苗头即时组织批判了“学”与
  “革”截然分开和单件生产不能革新的形而上学的观点，尤其是抓住冲压车间三昼夜三十六台压床进退料自动化，而且退料自动化装置是一个二级青工首创的事实，大破自卑感和条件论。之后又批判了喜洋厌土，喜大厌小，好高鹜远，一鸣惊人的思想，看不起小革新，不愿搞小革新，提出了小革新办大事，小改革破大关的口号。在运动起来实现了大批革新项目之后，又批判了革新到顶论和有限革命论，有些人认为小的革新已经提完再没有“油水”了，再搞就是大革新，而大革新又不容易。另有些人认为工人只能搞小革新，不能搞大革新，不能搞机械化、自动化，不能搞尖端。针对这种思想又提出“技术没有顶，革新无穷尽，只要动脑筋，永远可革新。”事实上很多设备、工艺装备在短短的四个月的时间内，已经进行了数次以至数十次的革新，冲压车间革新的一百三十三台设备中，两次革新以上的达一百零二台之多，十次革新以上的有七台。发动机车间轴瓦工部就是在台台有革新，产量翻一番的基础上，又进行了全盘的工艺革命，使产量又翻一番。在这次革命，也不是一帆风顺，有些车间的革新项目曾经经过二、三十次甚至四、五十次的失败，但是由于党和领导给他们不断支持与鼓舞，发挥了工人群众的顽强精神，因而终于最后成功。无数的事实证明，只要具有不断革命的思想和革命的志愿，在劳动实践中就会使认识逐渐深化，在认识不断深化的基础上就能不断的革新。因此，在运动中不断地解放思想，不断地破除迷信，树立广大职工明确的不断革命的思想，保持旺盛的革命热情，广大职工的智慧就能无穷无尽地发挥出来，就能使运动持续高涨的发展。
    第二、是不但有明确目标，而且有全面规划。
    这是对大规模群众运动实现集中领导的一个重要环节，有了明确的目标和全面规划就能把广大群众的智慧与力量集中到主要方面。第一拖拉机厂在运动一开始，去年11月就提出了年底基本达到设计水平，今年又提出“五一”全面突破设计定额，“十一”实现班产量翻一番的目标，根据运动的发展，最近又提出“五一”实现班产超过原设计产量的口号。每一个时期的目标，都是先进的而又是经过努力可以实现的，既是集中的又是具体的，可以具体到每一台设备，每一个工位，每一个人，因此既可望而又可即，就能有力地调动广大职工的主动性与积极性。为了更加广泛地动员群众和提高广大职工技术革新与技术革命的目的性与自觉性，厂里又提出了一增（增加产量），二保（保质量，保安全），三减少（减少体力劳动，手工操作，减少各种消耗，减少人员）的要求，作为衡量每一项革新的具体目标。我们在明确目标的同时，也拟定了全面规划。今年的规划是用八句话概括的，即：“政治挂帅树雄心，台台处处有革新，为了十一翻一番，达到一人顶数人，两化，个、十、百、千、万（注），实现革新十万件，掌握百项新技术，十项技术上尖端”（注：一个自动化车间，十个自动化工部或工段，一百条自动线或机组，一千台设备单机自动化或半自动化，一万项手工操作机械化）。规划中既包括经济、技术指标，也包括关键的重点项目（百项新技术），也包括能动员广大职工积极投入运动的要求（台台处处有革新，实现革新十万件），这就使广大职工既有明确的行动目标，又不会受规划所束缚。为实现规划的目标，运动朝着什么方向走，革什么，怎么革？厂里还提出了“两化”“四革”、“加尖端”作为运动的总方向，“两化”即机械化（半机械化）、自动化（包括半自动化），“四革”即加工方法、工艺装备、设备、产品的四大革新，“尖端”即先进与尖端技术的研究。这个方向是海阔天空，任何人都有用武之地。同时还提出了“五并”、“五边”和三个“三结合”一整套方针。
    “五并”即：“土洋并举，大小并举，全面革新与围攻关键并举，生产部门的革新与辅助部门的革新并举，不断采用先进技术与不断提高工人的操作水平并举”。
    “五边”即边试验，边采用，边完善，边推广，边提高。一项可行的新建议一经提出，就进行试验，在基本试成的条件下，就用于生产，在生产中边使用，边完善（修正补充），同时进行推广，在更多的人使用中，集中大家智慧，发展它，提高它。
    三个“三结合”：一个是指导思想上的“三结合”，即冲天的革命干劲与科学分析相结合，首创与学习相结合，自力更生与互相协作相结合。另一个是革新内容上的“三结合”，即远近相结合，技术革命与科学研究相结合，设备、工艺装备、工艺方法的革新与产品结构的革新相结合。再一个就是领导干部、工人和技术人员的“三结合”，领导干部、工人和技术人员的“三结合”在这次运动中发挥了巨大的作用，凡是较大的项目或复杂的革新都是经过三结合小组反复研究实现的。组织形式多种多样，主要的有（1）固定的三结合小组。车间、工部层层组织，主要是指导本单位的技术革新，帮助工人，研究实现革新建议。（2）三结合攻坚组。针对生产中的关键问题、薄弱环节或是工人提出的实现较难的课题，组织专门的三结合小组，围攻突破。（3）三结合会议。这是一种不定型不定期的灵活形式，会议开法有专题的，有专业的，也有综合性的。以上三种三结合的形式就组成了全厂的三结合网，不但在技术革新中发挥了巨大的威力，同时对三结合中三种人互相间也得到了很好的教益。
    第三、交流推广学、比、赶、帮。
    运动中厂里广泛运用了现场会、展览会、广播、报喜、出红榜、插红旗，以及广泛地组织参观表演等生动活泼的形式。运动的过程就是广泛的交流推广，学、比、赶、帮的过程。各车间之间，各工部之间，三三两两的观摩学习，有拜师求艺的，有送宝上门的，有些好的创造不过夜就传遍了全厂。通过广泛的互相交流，互相启发，大量的革新建议由点到面成批成套地涌现出来。比如，全厂“小革新办大事”的经验就是从燃料系统车间开头的，压床的进退料自动化是从冲压车间学起的，工序自动化和机床自动化是从发动机车间传开的。同时也不断地组织了向外厂外地的参观学习与经验交流，对运动广泛深入的开展，起了很大的启发与推动作用。例如有色修铸车间的泥型铸铁就是从外地学来的。不但同工种、同行业、同系统可以互相学习、互相帮助，就是不同行业、不同工种也可以互相学习、互相启发。因此，工人群众把学、比、赶、帮的运动形式作了如下结论：“隔行不隔理，行行理相通，互学互帮，广泛交流，三人胜过诸葛亮，众人智慧汇巨流。”
    第四、自力更生，互相协作与必要的物资供应相结合起来。
    随着运动的深入发展与大量革新建议的提出，尤其是生产自动线的建立，带来了实现革新建议的设计、材料、协作配件、加工制造等大量的工作量，如不加以妥善及时的解决，就会影响运动的持续发展，或势必产生提出革新建议多而实现少的情况，解决这个问题，我们采取了自力更生，互相协作，以前者为主的作法。运动一开始，就提出了自己创议、自己设计、自己制造、自己实现的口号，在材料上尽量利用废品、废料。因此，大量的革新项目是群众自力更生、自己实现的。也正因为如此，在短短的四个月时间里，全厂才能实现了二万五千八百多项革新建议。实践告诉我们，群众不但有无穷的智慧，还有冲天的干劲和坚韧不拔的毅力，首创压床退料自动化的胡海亮，整个退料装置的二十多个零件完全是利用废料做成的，其中两根六百多厘米长、二百多个齿的齿条，也是他自己利用废料以“钢梁磨成针”的毅力用锉刀锉成的。在强调自力更生的同时，还必须广泛的组织协作，大兴共产主义协作之风，尤其是对一些较大的革新项目的实现和自动生产线的建立，既需要较多的材料，又有很大的设计制造工作量，必须组织全工部全车间以至全厂的相互协作。如有色车间还采用了生动活泼的协作形式，车间成立了“支援两化（机械化、自动化）协作无限总公司”，下设若干“营业部”、“废料收购站”、“材料行”、“五金公司”、“搬运站”、“设计院”等，各工部根据自己的设备条件成立有限协作公司等非常活泼的协作组织。仅五天时间的统计，“废料收购站”就收入废品五千五百多公斤，售出六千二百多公斤，解决了六千多个零件的材料问题，各“营业部”有八百多人次参加了营业活动，解决了八千多个工时的机械加工任务，等于该车间机械、动力师两个工部一个月的生产量。此外，对革新当中所必须的一些材料和配件也必须本着节约的精神给予积极的供应。
    第五、定期组织“表演大会赛”是推动运动一浪高一浪向前发展的有效形式。
    厂党委决定全年于“三八”、“五一”、“七一”、“十一”、“元旦”组织五次技术革新与技术革命表演大会赛。首次大会赛已经于2月下旬举行，目前正准备“五一”献礼。厂准备通过这五次大会赛使运动一浪高过一浪地推向一个新高潮。
    我们洛阳第一拖拉机厂，也是一个新建投入生产不久的厂，经验也不多，在完成今后的工作中，当然也会遇到不少困难。这几个月来的工作中，我们深深体会到党中央提出以钢为纲的重要性，因为钢铁是我们最主要的材料和原料，大搞技术革新与技术革命，生产能力成倍乃至几十倍的提高之后，我们的厂就又像一个如饥如渴的青年小伙子，更需要天天大吃大喝。生产力与材料供应之间的矛盾，提到我们面前并需要迫切加以解决。最近谭副总理在人民日报发表的：“关于实现我国农业机械化的若干问题”一文中提到“……我国国民经济的发展。工业生产的大跃进，使我国钢产量在1959年达到了一千三百万吨以上，因而有可能在1960年拨出比第一个五年计划期间用于农业方面的钢材的总和还要多的钢材，来装备农业。”李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”中已决定分配用于农业机械和农具的钢材一百一十万吨，比1959年增长一倍左右。中央的这个指示给了我们以极大的鼓舞，我们洛阳第一拖拉机厂的技术革新与技术革命运动虽是刚刚开始，但已经显示了它的巨大威力。
    我们相信，今后在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在中央与毛主席的英明领导下，在上级党、政的领导和全国人民的大力支援和关怀下，只要继续鼓足更大的干劲，依靠群众，本着不断革命论的精神，继续努力使技术革新、技术革命运动一浪高一浪持续健康的发展下去，我们相信，提前实现我们规划的目标，生产出更多、更好、更新的拖拉机来支援农业是一定能够做得到的。
    最后，祝大会成功！祝各位代表身体健康！
