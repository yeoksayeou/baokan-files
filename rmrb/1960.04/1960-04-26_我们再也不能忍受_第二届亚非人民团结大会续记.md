"We Can No Longer Endure It"
Continued Report on the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference
By Our Correspondent Chen Jun

"We can no longer endure it!" This is the sorrowful and indignant cry of the South African representative at the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. This voice cries out the blood and tears of hundreds of millions of Africans. For centuries, the throne of Western imperialism has been built upon the gaunt white bones of black people. The most barbaric and cruel colonial system has taken everything from the African people: freedom, independence, and even the right to survive. Long-term exploitation and aggression by imperialism have created extreme poverty and backwardness in vast areas of Africa. Even now, medical and health conditions in Africa are extremely poor, and epidemics are rampant. Yellow fever, malaria, and sleeping sickness constantly threaten every African. In the interior of Guinea, due to long-term poverty, blindness in some rural areas reaches 10% of the total population; in Upper Volta, out of three million people, there are one hundred thousand lepers; in the Congo, half the population suffers from malaria; and the infant mortality rate is the highest in the world. One hundred million black Africans died tragically at the hands of slave traders. Yet, even today, the blood-sucking tubes of colonialism greedily suck the blood of the African people from every corner of Africa; the whips of the colonialists still cruelly enslave millions of black people; and the knives of imperialism still slaughter large numbers of black people striving for independence and freedom. Listen to the angry accusations of representatives from various African countries at the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference!

Deep-Seated Hatred
The South African people have been subjected to bloody massacres by the colonial government for opposing the "Pass Laws." The South African representative indignantly condemned South Africa's policy of racial discrimination, of which the "Pass Laws" are the foundation. The "Pass Laws" stipulate that every black person must carry a "pass" with nine pages and various markings. Black people, male and female, need a "pass" to find a job, a "pass" to find a house, and a "pass" to go out on the street. Black people are only allowed to live and work in places designated on the "pass." The South African people call this "pass" a "slave's pocket," which deprives black people of all freedom. Anyone who forgets to carry this document even once will be arrested by the police, fined heavily, and sentenced to seven days in prison. After sentencing, most people are sent to farms to do hard labor. The labor conditions on the farms are terrible, and everyone there is constantly subjected to the cruel whipping of the overseers. A black person who fails to carry a "pass" even once disappears without a trace. His family has no idea that their loved one has died tragically under the whip of the farm overseer. On average, as many as 500,000 black people are arrested each year for violating the "Pass Laws." This is why the South African people hate this detestable "law" so much. This time, the massacre by the South African federal government was caused by crowds in two places petitioning the police station, stating that they would not disperse until the "Pass Laws" were abolished, and would rather be arrested. The inhumane colonialists then launched a barbaric attack on them. The South African colonial government's suppression of this just struggle of the black people continues. The colonial government declared a "state of emergency," mobilized troops, stockpiled ammunition, and strengthened its fascist and barbaric rule. Military police arbitrarily broke into black people's homes, conducting searches and demolitions, and making large-scale arrests. The South African people had been patient for a long time, placing their hopes on peaceful petitions and the United Nations. Since 1952, the issue of racial discrimination in South Africa has been on the agenda of every UN General Assembly, but, as the South African representative told reporters, what is the use? The South African Prime Minister once said with contempt that all condemnations and protests from the international community are nothing more than waste paper in his wastebasket! How long must the South African people continue to endure? The South African representative replied: No! We can no longer endure it!

Under the colonialists' tight news blockade, little news has come out of Southwest Africa. The representative of Southwest Africa told the conference that the barbarity of the colonialists' massacre of the people of Southwest Africa is no less than that of South Africa. The people's uprising of 1917-1922 was drowned in the people's blood by the colonialists. The black people of Southwest Africa have no rights whatsoever. Various laws stipulate that black people have no right to meddle in national affairs. White people control everything, occupy almost all the land, leave it desolate, and do not allow black people to cultivate it freely.

In Kenya, the representative present at the conference told reporters: In the "Mau Mau" struggle, as many as 30,000 Kenyan people were massacred by the colonialists, but the suffering of the Kenyan people has not ended, and the spark of "Mau Mau" has not been extinguished. The vast majority of land in Kenya is also in the hands of white people. One white person can own 50,000 acres of land, while a black person cannot own more than 30 acres; one white person can own large coffee plantations, planting one million coffee trees, while a black person is not allowed to plant more than one hundred coffee trees. The minimum living expenses for a worker average six and a half pounds a month, while the current monthly wage for farm workers is only one and a half pounds. How can people live?

The representative of Angola exposed the darkness of Portuguese colonial rule. There, black people have absolutely no rights except the right to be slaves. They have no right to meddle in politics, no right to organize any groups or political parties, no freedom of speech or press, and even the right to education has been completely stripped away. Patriots can only run underground schools to carry out literacy campaigns. However, these patriots are regarded as traitors by the colonialists.

Accusations and Rallying
Countless disasters have accumulated into deep-seated hatred, and tens of millions of people can no longer endure it and are unwilling to live like this anymore! The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Conakry has become a conference for the African people to accuse imperialism and colonialism, a rally for the African people to demand emancipation, strive for freedom, overthrow imperialism, and completely destroy the colonial system.

The South African representative said: Imperialists have always portrayed the South African people's resistance to racial discrimination as being incited by a few agitators. But how can this excuse cover up the hideous face of the colonialists? In this struggle against the "Pass Laws," one million South Africans have thrown their "passes" into the raging fire, burning the "pockets" that bind them. He emphasized in a firm tone: Under the high pressure of the colonial government, revolution in South Africa is inevitable!

The representative of Kenya said excitedly: "The blood of the Kenyan people and the South African people who have shed blood for freedom and independence will not be shed in vain. The tree of freedom will grow rapidly under the irrigation of the blood of the African people!"

The representative of Cameroon, on behalf of the fighting people of Cameroon, solemnly declared that we must persist in armed struggle to the end and destroy the fake independence created by France.

The representative of Uganda said: We can no longer tolerate colonial rule. Slaughter cannot subdue the people striving for freedom. The struggle of the Ugandan people for independence has reached its climax.

The representative of Senegal directly stated that there is no basis for peaceful coexistence between the colonial people of Africa and imperialism and colonialists. Only by ending colonial rule and overthrowing the enslavement of imperialism can there be true peaceful coexistence. The African people must fight until the day when all African countries have gained independence.

Representatives from Tanganyika and Nyasaland stated that they are waging a resolute struggle for independence, and their goal is to give freedom to Central Africa and South Africa!

The representative of Zanzibar asked loudly at the meeting: Why can't the African people respond with force when imperialism uses force to argue with us?

Recently, armed uprisings against the Portuguese colonial rulers have also broken out in many cities in northern Angola.

Freedom Must Be Obtained Through Struggle
The African people have learned a sufficient lesson from long-term and brutal struggles, that is, freedom must be obtained through struggle, and imperialism will never give the African people freedom! This is why the Algerian people's six-year national liberation war is regarded by the African people as a symbol of the entire African liberation cause.

When the Algerian people began their armed uprising, there were only three thousand people, armed with outdated weapons and swords and spears. However, with the support of the entire population, the Algerian National Liberation Army has grown stronger and stronger, and has now become an army of 150,000 men with modern equipment. In the ten days before and after the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, the Algerian people's army achieved new victories, killing and wounding more than 1,100 French soldiers, shooting down 16 enemy planes, and destroying 56 armored vehicles. The Algerian representative expressed to the conference the Algerian people's boundless confidence in their victory. The African people have also further realized from the Algerian war that imperialism will not give up Africa. De Gaulle's so-called recognition of the Algerian people's "right to self-determination" is premised on eliminating the revolutionary forces in Algeria. De Gaulle himself has exposed the deceptive nature of his "declaration." Therefore, the declaration adopted by the conference stated: "We, the people of Asia and Africa, declare that we will never allow our national independence to be used as a bargaining chip under any circumstances. The heroic resistance of the Algerian people is the most eloquent proof of this." African representatives not only fully agreed to organize volunteer forces to aid the Algerian people, but also at this conference, representatives from Angola, Somaliland, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, and Morocco called for severing relations with imperialist countries and organizing volunteer forces to help all oppressed African countries gain liberation. This common aspiration has been adopted by the conference. The resolution on imperialism unanimously adopted by the conference states: To establish an Asian-African volunteer corps under appropriate conditions to support the people of Asian and African countries.

Imperialism Must Be Eliminated
Guinea and other African countries that have gained independence have demonstrated a common hatred for imperialism at the conference, clearly announcing that their goal is to strive for the liberation of the entire Africa. Only when all African countries are independent can their independence be reliably guaranteed. Because in many countries that have already gained independence, there are still military bases of the United States, Britain, France, and the North Atlantic Group, and colonialists still firmly control these countries economically, some representatives of African countries that have already gained independence have requested the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the removal of military bases to safeguard their independence and sovereignty. The representative of Guinea proposed that political independence alone is incomplete and that economic independence must be sought. It is necessary to rely on the power of the people to develop the economy and gradually get rid of imperialist economic control. Several countries' representatives believed in the discussion that even if disarmament is achieved, imperialist countries will not use the money saved to help backward countries develop their economies. They said: The money of imperialism always belongs to imperialism and will never be used to help backward countries develop their economies. The resolution on economic issues adopted by the conference adopted the opinions of many African countries, not only emphasizing that we cannot consider our struggle for independence to be completed before eliminating economic inequality and establishing a sound and independent economy. It also reminded all Asian and African countries that the purpose of imperialism or neo-colonialism is profit, and it attempts to control our wealth. The purpose of this "assistance" seems to be to keep Asian and African countries mainly agricultural and raw material producers and to hinder the industrialization of our countries. This "assistance" becomes a means of solving the economic problems of developed countries at the expense of our economy and attempts to transfer the economic difficulties of large countries to us. From this resolution, it is not difficult to understand that imperialism has already used its "assistance" to open the eyes of the African people, and imperialism's "favor" and "friendship" have lost their deceptive effect in the eyes of the African people. The conference's strong protest against the World Bank's repeated support for the most disgraceful exploitation plans of imperialism is the most powerful illustration.

The African people can no longer tolerate the enslavement of imperialism and colonialism. The African people are determined to take the Algerian people as an example and strive for national independence regardless of their own safety! They are full of confidence in victory, just as Guinean President Sekou Toure said: Relying on the strength and unity of the people, we will surely be able to eliminate imperialism.

The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference has given the African people great encouragement and strength. The African people will eventually break through all difficulties, win independence, win freedom, and establish a new Africa managed by Africans.

    “我们再也不能忍受”
    第二届亚非人民团结大会续记
    本报记者　陈浚
    “我们再也不能忍受！”这是南非代表在第二届亚非人民团结大会上发出的悲愤的声音。这个声音诉出了非洲亿万人民的血泪恨。几个世纪以来，在黑人的嶙嶙白骨之上，建立起了西方帝国主义的宝座。最野蛮最残酷的殖民制度，夺去了非洲人民的一切：自由、独立以至生存的权利。帝国主义长期的剥削和侵略，造成了非洲广大地区的极端贫困和落后状态。直到现在，非洲的医疗卫生条件还十分恶劣，疫病流行，黄热病、疟疾、睡眠病，经常威胁着每个非洲人。几内亚内地，由于过去长期生活的贫困，有的农村里，瞎子达到人口总数的10％，上沃尔特三百万人中有十万麻疯病人，刚果得疟疾病的占人口的一半，婴儿死亡率是世界上最高的。非洲曾有一亿黑人惨死在奴隶贩子的手中。然而，直到如今，殖民主义的吸血管，还贪婪地从非洲每一个角落吸吮着非洲人民的血液；殖民主义者的皮鞭，还凶残地奴役着千万黑人；帝国主义的屠刀，还大量地杀戮着争取独立、自由的黑人。听听来自非洲各国的代表们，在第二届亚非人民团结大会上的愤怒控诉吧！
    血海深仇
    南非人民为了反对“通行证法”，遭到了殖民政府血腥的屠杀。南非代表悲愤地谴责南非的种族歧视政策，而“通行证法”又是这种丑恶的种族歧视政策的基础。“通行证法”规定每个黑人必须携带长有九页、带着各种各样图记的“通行证”。黑人无论男女，找职业，要“通行证”；找房子，要“通行证”；出门上街，要“通行证”。黑人只准在“通行证”上指定的地方生活和工作。南非人民把这种“通行证”叫做“装奴隶的口袋”，这个“口袋”使黑人丧失了一切自由。谁如果一次忘记携带这个证件，被警察发觉，立即被捕，处以高额罚金，判以七天徒刑。判刑后，大多数人被送到农场中做苦工。农场的劳动条件之坏就不用提了，到了农场，人人随时都可能遭到监工凶狠的鞭笞。就是这样，一个黑人由于偶尔一次没有带“通行证”，就此一去不复返，毫无音信。他的家人那里晓得自己的亲人已经惨死在农场监工的皮鞭下。每年由于触犯“通行证法”被捕的黑人平均达五十万之多。这就是南非人民为什么如此痛恨这个可憎的“法律”。这一次南非联邦政府的大屠杀，就是由于两个地方的群众到警察局请愿，表示不废除“通行证法”他们不散，宁愿全体被捕。灭绝人性的殖民主义者就对他们发动了野蛮的进攻。南非殖民政府对于黑人这一正义斗争的镇压，还继续着。殖民政府宣布了“紧急状态”，调动了军队，储备弹药，加强了法西斯的野蛮统治，军警任意闯入黑人住宅，进行搜捕捣毁，大批抓人。南非人民曾经忍耐了很长一个时期，把希望寄托在和平请愿上，也曾经把希望寄托于联合国。从1952年起南非种族歧视问题就摆在每一届联合国大会的议程上，但是，南非的代表对记者说，这又有什么作用呢？南非总理曾经以轻蔑的口吻说过，所有来自国际上的一切谴责、抗议，不过是他的字纸篓里的废纸！还要南非人民继续忍受到什么时候呢？南非代表回答说：不！我们再也不能忍受了！
    西南非洲的情况，在殖民主义者的严密新闻封锁之下，很少传出来。西南非的代表向大会控诉说，殖民主义屠杀西南非人民的野蛮程度，绝不亚于南非。1917—1922年的人民起义，被殖民主义者用人民的鲜血淹没了。西南非的黑人没有一点权利，种种法律规定了黑人无权过问国事，白人控制了一切，白人占领了几乎全部的土地，任其荒芜，也不准黑人自由耕种。
    在怯尼亚，到会的代表对记者说：在“茅茅”斗争中，被殖民主义者屠杀的怯尼亚人民达三万之多，但是怯尼亚人民的苦难还未结束，“茅茅”的火种并未熄灭。怯尼亚的土地，也是绝大部分在白人手里。一个白人可以拥有五万英亩的土地，而一个黑人不能超过三十亩；一个白人可以拥有大片咖啡园，种植一百万棵咖啡，而一个黑人种的咖啡不得超过一百棵。一个工人的最低限度生活费用一个月平均要六镑半，而现在农场工人每月工资只有一镑半。人们怎么能生活下去呢？
    安哥拉的代表，揭露了葡萄牙殖民统治的黑暗。在那里，黑人除了做奴隶的权利以外，根本没有任何权利，谈不到过问政治的权利，没有组织任何团体和政党的权利，没有言论和新闻自由，甚至受教育的权利都被剥夺干净。爱国者只能举办地下学校，进行扫盲。但是，这些爱国者却被殖民主义者看成是叛国犯。
    控诉和誓师
    一笔笔数不清的灾难，积下了血海深仇，千千万万人再也不能忍受，再也不愿意这样生活下去了！亚非人民团结大会科纳克里会议，变成了非洲人民控诉帝国主义、殖民主义的大会，变成了非洲人民要求翻身，争取自由，打倒帝国主义，彻底摧毁殖民制度的誓师大会。
    南非代表说：帝国主义者一贯把南非人民反抗种族歧视，说成是少数煽动者煽动起来的。但是，这种借口，怎么能掩盖得了殖民主义者万恶的嘴脸呢？南非人民在这一次反对“通行证法”的斗争中，已有一百万人把“通行证”投进了融融的烈火，烧掉了套在自己身上的“口袋”。他以坚定的语气强调说：在殖民政府的高压下，南非的革命是不可避免的！
    怯尼亚的代表激动地说：“为自由、为独立洒出了鲜血的怯尼亚人民和南非人民，他们的鲜血是不会白流的。自由之树将在非洲人民的鲜血灌溉之下，迅速成长起来！”
    喀麦隆的代表，代表战斗着的喀麦隆人民庄严地宣布，我们一定要坚持武装斗争到底，摧毁法国制造的假独立。
    乌干达的代表说：我们再也不能容忍殖民主义统治，屠杀压服不了争取自由的人民。乌干达人民争取独立的斗争已经发展到了高潮。
    塞内加尔的代表直截了当地提出，非洲殖民地人民同帝国主义，同殖民主义者，没有和平共处的任何基础。只有结束了殖民统治，打倒了帝国主义的奴役，才能有真正的和平共处。非洲人民一定要斗争到整个非洲的国家都获得独立的一天。
    坦噶尼喀、尼亚萨兰的代表们表示，他们在为独立进行坚决的斗争，他们的目标是给中非、南非以自由！
    桑给巴尔的代表在会上大声地问道：为什么在帝国主义用武力同我们进行争论的时候，非洲人民不能用武力回答他们呢？
    最近，在安哥拉北部许多城市，也爆发了反对葡萄牙殖民统治者的武装暴动。
    自由要从斗争中取得
    非洲人民从长期残酷的斗争中，已经得到了充分的教训，那就是，自由是要从斗争中得来，帝国主义决不会给予非洲人民以自由！这就是为什么阿尔及利亚人民坚持了六年的民族解放战争，被非洲人民看成是整个非洲解放事业的象征。
    阿尔及利亚人民开始武装起义时，人数不过三千，拿的是陈旧武器和刀矛，但是，阿尔及利亚民族解放军在全民的支持下，越战越强，现在已经成为一支拥有现代化装备的十五万人的军队。就在第二届亚非人民团结大会会议前后的十天里，阿尔及利亚人民的军队又取得了打死打伤法军一千一百多名，击落敌机十六架，击毁装甲车五十六辆的新胜利。阿尔及利亚的代表向大会表示了阿尔及利亚人民对于自己的胜利具有无限信心。非洲人民从阿尔及利亚的战争中，也进一步认识到帝国主义是不会放弃非洲的。戴高乐散布的所谓承认阿尔及利亚人民“自决权”，是以消灭阿尔及利亚的革命力量为前提的，戴高乐已经自己揭穿了它的“宣言”的欺骗性。因之，在大会通过的宣言中写道：“我们亚非各国人民宣告，我们无论如何决不允许拿我们的民族独立作为讨价还价的东西。关于这一点，阿尔及利亚人民的英勇抵抗，是最雄辩的证明。”非洲的代表们不仅完全赞成组织志愿军援助阿尔及利亚人民，并且在这次大会上，安哥拉、索马里兰、象牙海岸、塞拉勒窝内、摩洛哥的代表们，都纷纷呼吁断绝同帝国主义国家的关系，组织志愿军，帮助一切被压迫的非洲国家获得解放。这个共同的愿望，已经被大会所采纳，在大会一致通过的关于帝国主义的决议里，写着：在适当的条件下建立一支亚非志愿军团，以支援亚非各国人民。
    一定要消灭帝国主义
    非洲已经获得独立的几内亚等国家，在大会上表现了对于帝国主义的同仇敌忾，明确宣布，它们的目标是争取整个非洲的解放，只有所有非洲的国家都独立了，才是它们独立的可靠保证。由于在许多已经独立的国家里，还有美国、英国、法国和北大西洋集团的军事基地，殖民主义者还在经济上牢牢控制着这些国家，因之，非洲的一些已经独立的国家代表要求撤出一切外国军队和撤除军事基地，维护他们的独立和主权，几内亚代表提出，只是政治上的独立，还是不完整的，必须求得经济上的独立，要依靠人民的力量，发展经济，逐步摆脱帝国主义的经济控制。好几个国家的代表在讨论中认为：即使实现了裁军，帝国主义国家也不会用节省下来的钱，帮助落后国家发展经济的。他们说：帝国主义的钱，总是帝国主义的，永远不会用来帮助落后国家发展经济。大会关于经济问题的决议中，采纳了非洲许多国家的意见，不仅强调在消灭经济不平等、建立一个健全和独立的经济之前，我们不能认为我们的争取独立的斗争已经完成。并且提醒所有亚非国家说：帝国主义或新殖民主义的目的是利润，它企图控制我们的财富。这种“援助”的目的似乎是使亚非国家保持主要是农业和原料生产者的地位，并阻挠我们国家的工业化。这种“援助”成为在使我们经济遭到牺牲的情况下解决发达国家的经济问题的一种手段，并企图把大国经济困难转嫁到我们身上来。从这个决议里，不难明白，帝国主义已经用自己的“援助”擦亮了非洲人民的眼睛，帝国主义的“恩惠”和“友谊”已经在非洲人民面前，丧失了它的欺骗作用。大会决议中强烈抗议世界银行一再支持帝国主义最不光采的剥削计划，就是最有力的说明。
    非洲人民已经再也不能容忍帝国主义和殖民主义的奴役了，非洲人民决心以阿尔及利亚人民为榜样，奋不顾身地争取民族独立！他们充满了胜利的信心，正像几内亚总统塞古·杜尔所说的：依靠人民的力量和团结，就一定能够消灭帝国主义。
    第二届亚非人民团结大会，给予非洲人民以极大的鼓舞和力量，非洲人民终将冲破一切困难，赢得独立，赢得自由，建立起一个非洲人管理的新非洲。
