    Hunan, Guangxi, and Fujian Provincial Party Secretaries Take Command to Ensure Quality
    Mass Production of Rice Transplanters and Training of Operators

    (Our report) Hunan Province launched a major inspection of the manufacturing quality and a large-scale technical drill of the use of rice transplanters before rice transplanting, to ensure that the rice transplanters manufactured and promoted this year will demonstrate their power during early rice transplanting.

    Up to recently, Hunan Province has produced more than 500,000 rice transplanters, exceeding the original plan set by the Provincial Party Committee. In the trial and promotion, the provincial Party secretaries took command to ensure the manufacturing quality of the rice transplanters. At the same time, a large number of rice transplanter operators were trained. Because all the work was grasped early, quickly, and well, and there were special factories, special personnel, and special materials for manufacturing, and the products were fully inspected, accepted, and appraised, the quality of the more than 500,000 rice transplanters produced was basically qualified. More than 800,000 rice transplanter operators have been trained in the province, with an average of nearly two operators per rice transplanter.

    In order to enable the rice transplanters to truly play a role in this year's early rice transplanting, the Provincial Party Committee recently organized two rice transplanter promotion and use inspection teams with more than 200 people to inspect, accept, and demonstrate in various places. The Xiangtan, Hengyang, and Chenxian levels of Party committees organized more than 130 quality inspection groups with the four-way combination of responsible comrades, technical workers, operators, and farmers to inspect the manufactured rice transplanters one by one.

    The more than 800,000 operators who have been trained have generally undergone a test review, and the test results show that 80% of the people can use, repair, speak, and keep them, and have obtained graduation certificates. Various places have taken measures to make up for the technical shortcomings of operators with poor operating skills.

    Early rice transplanting in Hunan is about to begin. The rice transplanters that have passed the strict inspection and acceptance are successively leaving the factory to the team, to the group, and to the individual; the vast number of operators are stepping up their practice, and the communes and brigades in various places have organized a group of skilled craftsmen and rice transplanter manufacturing experts to form field repair teams in order to ensure that they can be repaired as soon as they are broken. They have prepared a large number of rice transplanter parts to go to the countryside with the machine, carry tools to contract by area, and conduct field inspections and repairs, so that every rice transplanter can be used.

    (Our report) On the joyous fields of Guangxi, a fresh thing appeared—rice transplanters transplanting rice seedlings.

    The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee attaches great importance to the promotion of rice transplanters. It requires that key experimental promotion be carried out during this year's early rice transplanting to create experience, vigorously promote it in the late rice transplanting, and strive to realize the mechanization of rice transplanting in the early rice next year. According to statistics on March 25, there are more than 157,000 rice transplanters manufactured in the entire autonomous region that have passed the inspection.

    According to the experience of Guangxi in promoting rice transplanters, it is necessary to grasp three key links: First, it is necessary to ensure the quality of finished rice transplanters and strictly manufacture them in accordance with the finalized standards. For this reason, various places have generally established manufacturing professional teams and established a responsibility system. At the same time, various methods are adopted to quickly improve the manufacturing technical level. Shangsi County concentrated 100 iron and carpenters from various communes in the county agricultural machinery factory. The factory established a technical research institute and selected technicians with higher skills to form a technical guidance group to conduct roving guidance in the factory to impart technology. In addition, the method of large factories was also imitated, and iron and carpenters were divided into various majors to manufacture various parts to ensure the quality of product specifications and accelerate the manufacturing progress.

    Second, it is necessary to train technical personnel who use rice transplanters. The same rice transplanter, used by two people with different levels of operating skills, has different work efficiency and transplanting quality. Before the early rice transplanting, Guangxi seized the opportunity to hold short-term training classes. More than 149,000 rice transplanter operators have been trained in the entire autonomous region.

    Third, strengthen maintenance and storage work. Guangxi adopts professional teams, implements special personnel to use, special personnel to keep, and establishes and improves various management and use systems. In terms of repair, the method of being able to use and repair is implemented, and a large number of rice transplanter operators have learned to repair. Some are to incorporate carpenters into the rice transplanter professional team, which is convenient for inspection and repair at any time, and also convenient for protection.

    (Our report) More than 10,000 rice transplanters have been manufactured and promoted in various parts of Fujian Province.

    The planned planting area of ​​early rice in Fujian Province this year has increased by 2 million mu compared with last year. In order to complete the transplanting task in a timely manner and improve the transplanting quality, various places have launched a tool reform movement to rush to make and promote rice transplanters. In the movement, various places have established leading organizations for the manufacture and promotion of rice transplanters, and the Party Committee secretary took command at all levels to run training classes on a large scale to train technicians for manufacturing rice transplanters, and concentrated iron and carpenters to vigorously manufacture rice transplanters.

    In the mass production of rice transplanters, various places have vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution. The Changle County Farm Tool Factory has successively innovated eight tools, which increased the working efficiency of manufacturing rice transplanters by more than one time. The Changting County Agricultural Machinery Factory used to be able to manufacture only three or four rice transplanters a day. After the workers improved and created twelve new tools and innovated eighty operating techniques, the daily output of rice transplanters increased from the original four to twenty.

    While rushing to manufacture rice transplanters, various places have also stepped up the promotion of rice transplanters. The Zhao'an County Party Committee specially organized a performance team composed of rice transplanter experts to carry rice transplanters to various communes for rice transplanter performances. The county has also held six rice transplanter operator training classes, adopting the method of lecturing at night and practicing during the day, and trained more than 6,400 male and female rice transplanter operators. Fuqing County also sent technicians to the countryside to teach the technology of using rice transplanters, and trained a large number of rice transplanter operators for various communes.

    湖南广西福建各级党委书记挂帅保证质量
    大造插秧机　训练操作手
    本报讯　湖南省在插秧前展开了插秧机制造质量大检查和使用技术大练兵，保证今年制造推广的插秧机，在早稻插秧时，大显威力。
    到最近止，湖南全省已经造出插秧机五十万多部，超额完成了省委原订的计划。在试用推广中，全省各级党委书记挂帅，以保证插秧机制造质量。同时，大量训练插秧机操作手。由于各项工作抓得早、抓得快、抓得好，又有专厂、专人、专料制造，产品又经过全面检查验收鉴定，所以制造出的五十万多部插秧机，质量基本合格。全省已训练出插秧机操作手八十多万人，平均每部插秧机有近两个操作手。
    为了使插秧机在今年插早稻中真正发挥作用，最近，省委组织了有二百多人参加的两个插秧机推广使用检查队，分赴各地巡回检查、验收、表演。湘潭、衡阳、郴县各级党委组织了有负责同志、技术工人、操作手、农民四结合的质量检查小组一百三十多个，对已制造的插秧机逐部进行检查。
    各地对已训练的八十多万个操作手，普遍进行了一次测验复查，测验结果是80％的人做到了会使用、会修理、会讲、会保管，并分别得到使用毕业证书。对使用技术较差的操作手，各地都采取了措施进行技术补火。
    湖南早稻插秧即将开始，经过严格检查验收合格的插秧机，陆续出厂到队、到组、到人；广大操作手正加紧练习，各地公社、大队为了保证在使用时，随坏随修，还组织了一批能工巧匠和插秧机制造能手，组成田间修理组，准备了大批插秧机零件随机下乡，携带工具分片包干，进行田间巡回检修，使部部插秧机都能用上。
    本报讯　在广西各地欢闹的田野上，出现了一件新鲜事物——插秧机插秧。
    中共广西僮族自治区党委十分重视推广插秧机的工作。要求今年早稻插秧时，进行重点试验推广，以创造经验，在晚造时大力推广，争取明年早造实现插秧机化。到3月25日统计，全自治区制成的插秧机，经过检验合格的，有十五万七千多部。
    根据广西推广插秧机的经验，必须抓住三个环节：首先要保证插秧机成品质量，必须严格按照定型标准进行制造。为此，各地普遍建立制造专业队，订立责任制度。同时，采取各种办法，迅速提高制造技术水平。上思县把各公社调来的一百名铁木工，集中在县农械厂，厂里设立技术研究所，并挑选技术较高的技工组成技术辅导小组，在厂内巡回辅导，传授技术。另外还仿效大工厂的办法，把铁木工分成各种专业，分别制造各种部件，以保证产品的规格质量，同时也加快了制造进度。
    其次，要训练使用插秧机的技术人员。同样一部插秧机，由两个操作技术熟练程度不同的人来使用，工作效率和插秧质量就有高低。广西各地早在早稻插秧以前，就抓紧时机，举办短期训练班。全自治区现已培训了插秧机手十四万九千多人。
    第三，加强维修保管工作。广西各地采用专业队，实行专人使用，专人保管，建立与健全了各种管理使用制度。在修理方面，实行会使会修的办法，大批的插秧机手都学会修理。有的是把木工编入插秧机专业队，既便于随时检修，也便于保护。
    本报讯　福建省各地目前已经制造推广了一万多部插秧机。
    福建省今年早稻的计划种植面积比去年增加二百万亩，为了适时完成插秧任务和提高插秧质量，各地都开展了以赶制、推广插秧机的工具改革运动。在运动中，各地都建立了插秧机制造、推广的领导机构，层层由党委书记挂帅，大办训练班，培训制造插秧机的技术工人，并集中铁、木工人，大力制造插秧机。
    在大造插秧机中，各地都大搞技术革新和技术革命。长乐县农具厂先后革新了八项工具，使制造插秧机的工效提高一倍多。长汀县农械厂过去每天只能制造三、四部插秧机，职工们改良和创造了十二件新式工具和革新了八十项操作技术后，插秧机的日产量就由原来的四部提高到二十部。
    在赶制插秧机的同时，各地还大抓插秧机的推广工作。诏安县委专门组织了一个由插秧能手参加的表演队，携带插秧机到各公社进行插秧表演。这个县还先后举办了六期插秧机手训练班，采用晚上讲课白天实习的方法，培养了男女插秧机手六千四百多人。福清县也派出技术员下乡传授使用插秧机技术，为各公社培养了大量插秧机手。（附图片）
