Xinhua News Agency, April 8th -- The vigorous development of the urban people's commune movement has become one of the important topics discussed at the National People's Congress meeting today. Many representatives enthusiastically cheered this revolutionary mass movement of great historical significance in their speeches, believing that the development of the urban people's commune movement will further profoundly change the political and economic landscape of China's cities and the spiritual outlook of urban people.

    The congress continued its full-day discussion today. Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said at the meeting that at present, all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in the country have established a number of urban people's communes based on the principle of voluntariness, with a population of nearly 20 million people. Most cities in Henan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, and other provinces have basically realized the people's commune system. Now, urban people's communes are developing rapidly and in large numbers, and have begun to form a surging and magnificent mass movement. It is foreseeable that in a not-too-long period, cities across the country will basically realize the people's commune system.

    Li Jiebo said that the great development of urban people's communes, like rural people's communes, is not accidental. It is a product of China's economic and political development, and a product of the general line of socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward in production. Over the past year or so, urban people's communes have demonstrated strong vitality. They have shown great effects in developing production, organizing life, further liberating the labor force, strengthening the people's communist education, changing customs, and transforming society. According to preliminary statistics, urban people's communes and street organizations have established more than 56,000 industrial production units, employing nearly 2 million people. In 1959, the output value reached more than 2 billion yuan, equivalent to more than twice the output value of local state-owned enterprises nationwide in 1949. Over the past year or so, urban people's communes and street organizations have transferred more than 3.4 million people to state-owned factories, mines, and institutions, helping large factories and mines solve the difficulties of labor shortage and ensuring the completion of the Great Leap Forward plan for large factories and mines.

    Li Jiebo emphasized that the urban people's commune movement is a revolutionary mass movement of great historical significance. The development of this movement will further profoundly change the political and economic landscape of China's cities and the spiritual outlook of urban people. He said that when the Chinese people are celebrating the arrival of the high tide of the urban people's commune movement with joy and excitement, imperialists and their echoers are, like they did with our rural people's communes, launching vicious attacks and slanders against our urban people's communes, and making frenzied clamors. He said, let them grieve and clamor, no force can stop the advance of this wheel of history!

    Minister of Commerce Yao Yilin also talked about the issue of urban people's communes in his speech. He said that organizing the economic life of the people is an important aspect of organizing urban people's communes. In order to tap the labor potential of cities, it is necessary to further organize the economic life of urban people and realize the socialization of housework and the collectivization of life.

    Yao Yilin said that organizing the economic life of the people is an urgent requirement for further developing urban industrial production, and it is an inevitable change in lifestyle caused by the further development of the mode of social production in our country. The commercial departments should focus on the following three aspects in organizing the urban people's commune movement, especially in organizing the economic life of urban people: helping the masses to set up public canteens and nurseries; organizing the masses to set up various life service undertakings such as laundry, tailoring, repair, hairdressing, and bathing; and organizing the masses to rationally allocate commodities to better meet people's consumption needs. In addition, they should also actively help and promote the development of urban people's commune industry and urban street industry, and actively participate in organizing the people's political life and cultural life.

    Representatives from Shenyang and Beijing cited a large number of facts to praise the great achievements of the urban people's commune movement and the comprehensive organization of people's economic life. Liu Baotian, Vice Governor of Liaoning Province, and Gong Tianmin introduced the urban people's commune situation in Shenyang City, saying that the people's communes in the city have now established 484 factories and 1,380 workshops. In 1959, the total output value of commune-run industries reached more than 170 million yuan, equivalent to the total value of the city's handicraft industry in 1954. On the basis of developing production, the people's communes in the city have vigorously developed collective welfare undertakings, and the economic life of residents has been continuously improved. The masses praised the benefits of the commune, saying: "The commune is public, the commune is great, thousands of households participate together, it can move mountains and fill the sea, and eradicate poverty and backwardness." Gao Fengqin, a family member of an employee of the Northeast Machine Factory in Shenyang City, said that after their factory established a people's commune, 80% of the family members of the factory's employees participated in social labor. A large number of women participated in production and collective activities, further improving their ideological awareness. Zhang Xiaomei, Director of the Beijing Women's Federation, introduced the situation of Beijing's housewives participating in social production and comprehensively organizing economic life in her speech. She pointed out that after two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, great changes have taken place in the streets of Beijing. The broad masses of housewives have vigorously developed street industries and social collective welfare and service undertakings. Now, 250,000 people have participated in social labor, truly "everyone is engaged in production, and every household is busy."

    Luo Qiong, First Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, talked about the significant role played by Chinese women in socialist construction in her speech. She said that in the past two years, under the impetus of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the people's commune, women in urban and rural areas across the country have rapidly and universally participated in social labor. Almost all women with labor capacity in rural areas have participated in various labor activities, and women have become a main force in agricultural production. The number of female workers nationwide has reached more than 8 million, and millions of family members of workers and urban street women have participated in the production, life, service organizations, and other social labor run by urban people's communes and streets. She said that in order to develop socialist construction at high speed and to continuously realize the complete liberation of women, our women must, together with the people of the whole country, vigorously develop urban people's communes and strive to promote the continuous and sound development of rural people's communes.

    Minister of Education Yang Xiufeng spoke on the issue of "actively carrying out teaching reform and developing education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." He said that China's education has made great progress since 1958. The number of schools has increased greatly, the layout of schools has further adapted to the requirements of national economic development, and a large number of part-time schools have been developed in rural and urban areas, thus completing the development targets stipulated in the second five-year plan three years ahead of schedule. However, compared with the needs of the high-speed development of national socialist construction, the development speed of education is still not compatible. He said that actively carrying out teaching reform with a spirit of continuous revolution, first of all, the teaching reform of middle and primary schools, and developing education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, is our most urgent task.

    Yang Xiufeng said that the main problems existing in middle and primary school education at present are that the length of study is too long and the required level is low. He believes that the current length of study in middle and primary schools should be shortened, and can also be shortened; after appropriately shortening the length of study, the level of students can also be appropriately improved, which is extremely beneficial to national construction and the growth of young people.

    Yang Xiufeng said that in 1960, we should implement the policy of running schools by the whole party and the whole people on a larger scale and give full play to the initiative of all parties. All industrial and mining enterprises, scientific research institutions, organizations, troops, people's communes, and urban streets across the country can run the schools they need. In running education on a large scale, it is necessary to combine popularization with improvement. On the one hand, we should let go and develop vigorously to popularize education; on the other hand, we must grasp the key points and vigorously improve education.

    Some famous scientists today proposed in their speeches that scientists should unite and strive to reach the peak of world science in a short period of time with the spirit of great collaboration. Zhu Kezhen, Qian Chongshu, Qian Xuesen, Bei Shizhang, Zhao Zhongyao, Tong Dizhou, Liu Chongle, Zhu Xi, Zhang Xi, Zhang Wenyu, Guo Yonghuai, Dong Yumo, Wang Jiwu, Lu Shijia, Gu Gongxu, Yang Shixian, Wang You, Wu Xuezhou, Zhang Dayu, and Ding Ying all spoke today, talking about the new situation of the Great Leap Forward on China's scientific front, and expressed that they must work hard to complete the twelve-year scientific and technological development plan ahead of schedule.

    The great call issued by the Party to mobilize all forces to vigorously support agriculture has aroused a great response at the meeting. Jiao Guonai, Vice Governor of Shanxi Province, said that at present, each commune in Shanxi Province has an average of two factories supporting it, including the forces of industry, transportation, commerce, finance, science, education, culture, and health, forming a great mass revolutionary movement. Jiao Guonai talked about one of the main characteristics of Shanxi Province's industrial front supporting agriculture, which is to adopt the form of factories linking up with counties and factories linking up with communes.

    Zheng Yimu, Director of the Gushan People's Commune in Fuzhou, a representative from a rural people's commune, said in his speech that we are particularly happy about the issue of mutual support between industry and agriculture and the common leap forward of urban and rural areas. Because our commune has received strong support from the city in various aspects, the commune members have "divorced" from waterwheels and carrying poles, and the oxen have also "changed careers" to engage in transportation. Now, the commune has tractors for cultivation, water turbine pumps, water pumps, and artificial rainmakers for irrigation, and vehicles for transportation. The commune has established more than a dozen factories, including agricultural machinery, shipbuilding, and brick and tile factories, and has trained 1,100 workers. Now, it can produce small diesel engines and other semi-mechanized agricultural tools by itself.

    Zheng Yimu said that the commune members are very grateful to the workers and the people in the city for their support, and they all expressed that they would vigorously develop agricultural production to support the workers and the city.

    Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, focused on the issue of carrying forward the communist spirit of Chinese youth and promoting the continuous rise of the communist consciousness of youth. He said that the great upsurge of communist ideology is the most valuable spiritual wealth that the Great Leap Forward has brought to Chinese youth. Carrying forward the communist spirit of youth and promoting the continuous rise of the communist consciousness of youth is our unwavering responsibility. He said that standing firm in one's position, thinking of every possible way, and exerting all efforts to strive for the continued leap forward this year is the lofty responsibility of Chinese youth and the highest expression of the communist consciousness of Chinese youth.

    Lu Zhengcao, Vice Minister of Railways, talked about the importance of running local railways on a large scale in his speech. He said that running local railways on a large scale is a major event in the history of railway development in our country. It will greatly accelerate the speed of railway construction in our country and make the railway transportation industry more adaptable to the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. By the end of 1959, more than 400 local railways had been built and were under construction across the country, with a total length of more than 6,000 kilometers. According to preliminary statistics, local railways with a length of tens of thousands of kilometers will be built across the country this year. He said that local railways have low transportation costs, can be adapted to local conditions, can be simple and easy, and can be made from local materials. As long as we vigorously advocate, publicize, create momentum, and work hard, we will definitely be able to do a good job.

    Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Fanwu, Governor of Heilongjiang Province, Liang Huaxin, Deputy Director of the Ethnic Affairs Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Cheng Shutian, Director of the Liuzhou Iron and Steel Plant, and Yue Weifan, Mayor of Taiyuan City, respectively introduced the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Shanghai, Heilongjiang Province, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and Taiyuan City in their speeches today. Their speeches show that the great national technical innovation and technical revolution movement has created a magnificent situation of "great technical revolution, great leap forward in science, great development in production, great improvement in ideology, and great popularization of culture" in various places.

    Many overseas Chinese representatives spoke at the conference today. They talked about the inspiration of the leaping development of the motherland's construction cause to overseas Chinese, the contributions of returned overseas Chinese and their families in various construction causes, the progress of returned overseas Chinese students, and unanimously expressed their support for the measures taken by the Chinese government to comprehensively resolve the issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, April 8th -- The Second Session of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC continued its plenary discussion today.

    A total of sixty-three people spoke and submitted written speeches at the plenary session this morning and afternoon. Among them, members from the agricultural production front and those who had inspected the countryside all talked about how the rural people's communes have liberated the endless wisdom and strength of the vast number of farmers, and they will definitely be able to achieve the glorious task of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. Member Wang Yukun was originally one of the founders of the famous "Three Poor Peasants Cooperative" in Nanwangzhuang, Shenxian County, Hebei Province. He introduced the achievements of the continuous Great Leap Forward in the Nanwangzhuang People's Commune in 1959 at today's meeting. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the total grain output of the commune increased by 26%, the total cotton output increased by 98%, and the average income of the members increased by 25%. Zeng Guangfu, Director of the Dongduzhuang People's Commune in Fanxian County, Shandong Province, said that their commune, in the severe drought last year when there was no heavy rain for three consecutive months, the members used the tenacious struggle of "following the sun during the day, following the moon at night, fighting drought until the dragon bows its head, and fighting drought until the grain is in hand" to irrigate more than 85,000 mu of crops two to three times, and as a result, not only did production not decrease, but they also won a bumper harvest, with an average grain yield of more than 500 jin per mu, and more than 90% of the members increased their income. He said that without the people's commune, this would be impossible. This year, all 115,000 mu of cultivated land in the commune can realize self-flowing irrigation. He expressed full confidence in achieving grain as the key link, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries will have a better, more comprehensive, and sustainable leap forward.

    Liu Kunshui, a member of the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee, said that the people's communes in the suburbs of Chongqing have shown great superiority in producing vegetables and ensuring the supply of non-staple foods to the city. Last year, Chongqing's suburbs built a total of 345,000 mu of vegetable production bases, and the total vegetable output increased by 28% compared with 1958. Therefore, it is guaranteed that everyone in the urban area can eat more than one jin of vegetables per day. Du Guangyu, Vice Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, said that since the realization of the people's commune in Heilongjiang Province, the development of animal husbandry production has appeared at an unprecedented high speed. By the end of 1959, the number of pigs in the province increased by 65% compared with the same period in 1958, the number of large livestock increased by 8.1%, and the number of sheep increased by 54%. Baiquan County reached one pig per person, Acheng County appeared with "one pig producing a hundred piglets," and Anda County created a new record of "one sheep producing five lambs a year." He said that Heilongjiang Province's animal husbandry has entered a new stage of pig as the center, comprehensive development of animal husbandry, and all improved breeds, and is striving to achieve "five fulls and five 'izations'," that is, full breeding, full accuracy, full birth, full survival, full robustness, and high yield, improved varieties, disease-free, base-based, and mechanized. At present, the people's communes are running large-scale ranches, and they have launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement in animal husbandry production. Some communes have successfully created continuous operation automatic lines for pig raising. He expressed full support for Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report and will work hard to further accelerate the development of animal husbandry.

    Zhang Xiuzhu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke on the development of workers' education and cultural undertakings, saying that since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, workers' education has seen a new situation of great development, great improvement, and continuous upward trend. By the end of 1959, more than 16 million workers in industrial and mining enterprises across the country participated in spare-time school studies, and this number increased to more than 19 million in February this year. In many areas, more than two-thirds of the young and middle-aged workers regularly participate in studies. He said that workers' education and cultural activities must closely follow the situation of continuous leap forward, and must be further developed, consolidated, and improved on the existing basis. In the next year or two, the illiteracy of existing young and middle-aged workers will be basically eliminated, primary education will be popularized, and spare-time secondary and junior colleges will be run on a large scale. In terms of workers' cultural and artistic activities, workers all enthusiastically sing praises to the three magic weapons of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, and praise the technical revolution and cultural revolution. In the future, literary and artistic activities should be developed in various forms.

    Wu Xuelin, Deputy Director of the Institute of Mechanical Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, talked about the situation of mechanical scientific research in China. He said that in the past two years, under the situation of the whole party and the whole people engaging in scientific research on a large scale, the number of mechanical scientific research institutions across the country has increased exponentially. Many schools and enterprises have mechanical research institutions, and many people's communes are also conducting simple research on agricultural machinery, transportation tools, and power machinery. In the field of agricultural machinery research alone, a large number of new agricultural tools and agricultural machines suitable for different farming conditions in various regions of China have been created, and rice transplanters have been well received at home and abroad. He said that our scientific workers must arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, emancipate their minds, and strive to achieve the twelve-year scientific and technological plan in a relatively short period of time and climb the peak of world science. Qiao Qiming, a member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, said that scientific research work should adhere to the principle of politics taking command, vigorously carry out mass movements, promote a style of collaboration, and closely integrate with production. Taking the cultivation of fine varieties of crops as an example, among the more than 2,400 new varieties of crops that have been cultivated and promoted nationwide since liberation, those selected and cultivated by the working masses account for two-thirds, more than ten times the number of varieties cultivated by agricultural experts in the 26 years before liberation. This comparison shows that scientific research can only achieve significant results under the leadership of the Party and by following the mass line.

    Liu Qingyang, a member of the Standing Committee of the China Democratic League, spoke about the situation of the members of various democratic parties and non-party democratic people in Hebei Province implementing the spirit of gentle breeze and drizzle to carry out ideological remolding. She said that many members of democratic parties and senior intellectuals reflected after visiting urban and industrial construction and rural people's communes and water conservancy projects: they saw the powerful power of the Party's general line everywhere, and were moved by the soaring enthusiasm of the workers and peasants, thus improving their ideological awareness. She believes that in the situation of the continuous wave-like leap forward development of the national socialist construction cause, it is of great significance to step up ideological remolding. In ideological remolding, it is necessary to correctly understand the method of gentle breeze and drizzle and positive education. Gentle breeze and drizzle cannot be separated from criticism and self-criticism. Gentle breeze and drizzle is to achieve better fundamental remolding.

    Rong Yiren, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that when he visited factories and people's communes in various places, he saw that workers and peasants showed infinite loyalty and love to the Party and the socialist cause, and he was very moved. He said that the vast amount of inventions and creations that have emerged in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement are mostly made by ordinary workers and peasants, and these workers and peasants do not care about personal gains or losses, and are wholeheartedly trying to build the country into a prosperous, strong, and happy socialist society. This is the fundamental difference between the working people and bourgeois intellectuals. He believes that in order to achieve "caring about one end" and "leaning to one side," industrialists and businessmen must take the working people as specific role models to learn from.

    Members Dong Qiwu, Chen Mingren, and Tao Zhiyue made a joint speech, comparing the financial work of the new China with the financial work of the old China. They said that the characteristics of financial work in the new period of socialist construction in our country are: more income, more expenditure, and more construction; more income, more expenditure, and more construction. When we recall the financial situation during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, it can be summarized as: more exploitation, more embezzlement, and more destruction; more exploitation, more embezzlement, and more destruction. This comparison illustrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. They finally said that now there is a sea of red light on the mainland of our country, but US imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan, and we must continue to persist in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad and strive for the liberation of Taiwan.

    The following also spoke or submitted written speeches at today's meeting: Zhou Peiyuan, Huang Fanggang, Li Xuehai, Ren Zhiming, Du Mengmo, Chen Heqin, Yuan Jinzhang, Huang Demao, Fu Maoji, Zheng Xiaocang, Huang Zhenxun, Xu Changxun, You Jiajun, Wang Daheng, Wang Shaoyan, Huang Yumen, Diao Zhaofen, Ye Baoshan, Wu Juenong, Chen Suiheng, Jing Shuping, Lu Zongcheng, Tu Yuqing, Guang Sheng, Chen Yunzhang, Zheng Bijian, Wu Tianbao, Zhao Zongyu, Miao Hainan, Zhang Weicen, Zhu Yunshan, Yu Mingyu, Zhou Xinmin, Wen Jiasi, Zeng Zesheng, Zhang Jiyuan, Huang Changshui, Huang Dingchen, Wang Yuanxing, Liang Jinshan, Wang Yizhi, Wang Jiyuan, Zhou Zheng, Tian Xin, Zhong Huilan, Li Pingheng, Yuan Dunli, Liu Duoquan, Song Yunbin, Zeng Zhaolun, and Li Boqiu.

    At this point, the plenary discussion has ended. Over the past five days, a total of 314 people have made speeches or submitted written speeches in the plenary discussion. Tomorrow morning, the meeting will hold group discussions on Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report, and in the afternoon, it will attend the meeting of the National People's Congress.

    人大代表热烈欢呼具有伟大历史意义的革命群众运动
    城市人民公社好得很
    政协委员坚信全国农业发展纲要一定能够提前实现
    新华社8日讯　城市人民公社运动的蓬勃发展，成了今天全国人民代表大会会议所讨论的重要内容之一。许多代表在发言中热烈欢呼这个具有伟大历史意义的革命群众运动，认为城市人民公社运动的发展，必将进一步使我国城市的政治、经济面貌和城市人民的精神面貌发生深刻的变化。
    今天大会继续进行全天讨论。中华全国总工会副主席李颉伯在会上说，目前，全国各省、市、自治区都按照自愿原则建立了一批城市人民公社，公社人口近二千万人。河南、河北、黑龙江等省多数城市，已经基本上实现了人民公社化。现在，城市人民公社正在迅速地大量地发展起来，已经开始形成汹涌澎湃、波澜壮阔的群众运动。可以预料，在不太长的时间里，全国城市将基本上实现人民公社化。
    李颉伯说，城市人民公社的大发展，和农村人民公社一样，不是偶然的，它是我国经济和政治发展的产物，是社会主义建设总路线和生产大跃进的产物。一年多来，城市人民公社表现了强大的生命力，它在发展生产、组织生活、进一步解放劳动力、加强人民的共产主义教育、移风易俗、改造社会等方面，都已经显示了巨大的作用。据初步统计，目前城市人民公社和街道组织已办起了工业生产单位五万六千多个，从业人员近二百万人；1959年产值达二十亿元以上，相当于1949年全国地方国营企业产值的两倍多。各城市人民公社和街道组织，一年多来仅向国营厂矿企业和事业单位就输送了三百四十多万人，帮助大厂矿企业解决劳力不足的困难，保证了大厂矿企业跃进计划的完成。
    李颉伯强调说，城市人民公社运动是一个具有伟大历史意义的革命群众运动，这个运动的发展，必将进一步使我国城市的政治、经济面貌和城市人民的精神面貌发生深刻的变化。他说，当我国人民正以欢欣鼓舞的心情庆贺我国城市人民公社运动高潮到来的时候，帝国主义者及其应声虫，又在像对我国农村人民公社一样，对我国城市人民公社进行恶毒的攻击和污蔑，进行疯狂的叫嚣。他说，让他们悲泣叫嚣去吧，任何力量都不能阻止这一历史车轮前进！
    商业部长姚依林在发言中也谈到城市人民公社的问题。他说，在组织城市人民公社的工作中，组织人民经济生活是一个重要的方面。为了挖掘城市的劳动潜力，必须把城市人民的经济生活进一步组织起来，实现家务劳动社会化和生活集体化。
    姚依林说，组织人民经济生活是进一步发展城市工业生产的迫切要求，是我国社会生产方式进一步发展中必然引起的生活方式的变革。商业部门应当在组织城市人民公社运动中，特别是在组织城市人民经济生活方面，着重做好以下三个方面的工作：帮助群众兴办公共食堂和托儿所；组织群众兴办洗衣、缝补、修理、理发、洗澡等各种生活服务事业；组织群众合理分配商品，更好地满足人们的消费需要。此外还应积极帮助和促进城市人民公社工业和城市街道工业的发展；积极参与组织人民的政治生活和文化生活的工作。
    来自沈阳和北京的代表，举出大量事实歌颂城市人民公社运动和全面组织人民经济生活的巨大成就。辽宁省副省长刘宝田、巩天民介绍沈阳市的城市人民公社情况说，这个市的各人民公社目前已经建立了四百八十四个工厂、一千三百八十个车间。1959年社办工业的总产值达到一亿七千多万元，相当于1954年全市手工业产值的总和。全市人民公社在发展生产的基础上，大办集体福利事业，居民的经济生活不断得到改善，群众赞颂公社的好处说：“公社公来公社大，千家万户齐参加，能移山来能填海，贫困落后连根拔”。沈阳市东北机器厂职工家属高凤琴说，他们工厂成立了人民公社后，全厂80％的职工家属都参加了社会劳动。大批妇女参加了生产和集体活动，进一步提高了思想觉悟。北京市妇联主任张晓梅在发言中介绍了北京市家庭妇女参加社会生产和全面组织经济生活的情况。她指出，经过两年连续大跃进，北京的街道上出现了翻天复地的大变化。广大家庭妇女大办街道工业，大办社会集体福利事业和服务事业，现在已有二十五万人参加了社会劳动，真正是“人人闹生产，家家无闲人。”
    全国妇联书记处第一书记罗琼在发言中，谈到我国妇女在社会主义建设中发挥的重大作用。她说，近两年来，在工农业生产大跃进和
  人民公社推动下，全国城乡妇女迅速地普遍地参加了社会劳动。在农村有劳动能力的妇女几乎全部参加了各项劳动，妇女成为农业生产上的一支主力军。全国女职工人数已有八百多万人，还有几百万职工家属和城市街道妇女参加了城市人民公社办的、街道办的生产、生活、服务组织以及其他社会劳动。她说，为了高速度发展社会主义建设事业，为了不断地实现妇女的彻底解放，我们妇女一定要和全国人民一起，大力发展城市人民公社，努力促进农村人民公社不断地健全的发展。
    教育部长杨秀峰就“积极进行教学改革，多快好省地发展教育事业”问题发言。他说，我国教育事业从1958年以来，已经有了巨大的发展，学校数量大增，学校布局进一步适应了国民经济发展的要求，并且在农村和城市中发展了大量的半日制学校，因此提前三年完成了第二个五年计划规定的发展指标。但是，要同国家社会主义建设高速度发展的需要相比，教育事业的发展速度仍然不相适应。他说，以不断革命的精神积极进行教学改革，首先是中、小学的教学改革，更加多快好省地发展教育事业，是我们最迫切的任务。
    杨秀峰说，中、小学教育中目前存在的主要问题是，学习年限过长，要求的程度又低。他认为现行中小学年限应该缩短，也可以缩短；适当缩短学习年限之后，学生的程度还可以适当提高，这对国家建设和青少年的成长都是极大的好事。
    杨秀峰说，1960年要更大规模地实行全党全民办学，充分发挥各方面的积极性。全国一切工矿企业、科学研究机构、机关团体、军队、人民公社、城市街道，都可以办自己所需要的学校。在大办教育事业中，要普及与提高相结合，一方面放手发展，大力普及；另一方面必须掌握重点，大力提高。
    一些著名的科学工作者今天在发言中提出，科学工作者要联合起来，以大协作的精神争取在短期内登上世界科学的高峰。竺可桢、钱崇澍、钱学森、贝时璋、赵忠尧、童第周、刘崇乐、朱洗、张玺、张文裕、郭永怀、董聿茂、王季午、陆士嘉、顾功叙、杨石先、汪猷、吴学周、张大煜、丁颖等人，今天在发言中都畅谈了我国科学战线的跃进新形势，并且表示一定要为提前完成十二年的科学技术远景规划而努力。
    党所发出的动员各方面力量大力支援农业的伟大号召，在会上引起了巨大的反响。山西省副省长焦国鼐说，现在山西省平均每个公社都有两个工厂进行支援，包括工业、交通运输、商业、金融、科学、文教、卫生等各个方面的力量都被动员起来，形成了一个伟大的群众革命运动。焦国鼐谈到山西省工业战线支援农业的主要特点之一，是采取工厂和县挂钩，工厂和公社挂钩的形式。
    来自农村人民公社的代表、福州古山人民公社社长郑依牳在发言中说，我们对于工农业相互支援、城市农村共同跃进的问题，心里感到特别高兴。我们公社由于得到了城市从各方面的大力支援，社员们已经跟水车和扁担“离婚”了，耕牛也“改行”去搞运输了。现在，公社里耕种有拖拉机，灌溉有水轮机、抽水机和人工降雨器，运输有车子。公社建立了农业机械、造船、砖瓦等十几个工厂，培养出了一千一百名工人，现在已能自己生产小型柴油机和其他半机械化农具。
    郑依牳说，社员们非常感激工人老大哥和城市人民对他们的支援，都表示要大力发展农业生产来支援工人和城市。
    共青团中央委员会书记处第一书记胡耀邦的发言，着重谈到发扬我国青年的共产主义精神，促进青年共产主义觉悟不断高涨的问题。他说，共产主义思想的大高涨，是大跃进带给我国青年的一切财富中最可宝贵的精神财富。发扬青年的共产主义精神，促进青年共产主义觉悟的不断高涨，这是我们坚持不懈的责任。他说，站稳自己的岗位，想尽一切办法，使出一切力量，为实现今年的继续跃进而奋斗，是我国青年的崇高责任，也是我国青年共产主义觉悟的最高表现。
    铁道部副部长吕正操在发言中，谈到大办地方铁路的重要性。他说，大办地方铁路是我国铁路发展史上的一件大事，它将大大加快我国铁路建设的速度，使铁路运输业更加适应工农业跃进的需要。到1959年底，全国已经建成和正在施工的地方铁路已有四百多条，总长六千多公里。据初步统计，今年各地将修建上万公里的地方铁路。他说，地方铁路的运输成本低，能因地制宜，因陋就简，就地取材，简单易行，只要我们大力提倡，大张旗鼓，大造声势，大干特干，就一定能够办得好。
    中共上海市委书记曹荻秋、黑龙江省省长李范五、广西僮族自治区民族事务委员会副主任梁华新、柳州钢铁厂厂长程曙天、太原市市长岳维藩等代表，在今天的发言中分别介绍了上海市、黑龙江省、广西僮族自治区和太原市技术革新和技术革命运动的发展情况。他们的发言表明，伟大的全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动，已在各地出现了“技术大革命、科学大跃进、生产大发展、思想大提高、文化大普及”的宏伟局面。

    据新华社8日讯　政协第三届全国委员会第二次会议今天继续进行大会讨论。
    在今天上午和下午大会上发言和书面发言的共有六十三人。其中来自农业生产战线和视察过农村的委员，都谈到了农村人民公社把广大农民无穷无尽的智慧和力量解放出来，一定能够提前实现全国农业发展纲要的光荣任务。委员王玉坤原是著名的河北省深县南王庄“三户贫农合作社”的创始人之一，他在今天的大会上介绍了南王庄人民公社1959年连续大跃进的成就。这个公社在1958年大跃进的基础上，粮食总产量又增长了26％，棉花总产量增长98％，社员平均收入提高了25％。山东省范县董杜庄人民公社主任曾广福说，他们公社在去年连续三个月没有得到透雨的大旱情况下，社员们用“白天跟着太阳转，夜晚跟着月亮转，抗旱抗到龙低头，抗旱抗到粮到手”的顽强斗争，把八万五千多亩农作物连浇了两遍到三遍水，结果不但没有减产，还夺得了大丰收，粮食亩产量平均达到五百斤以上，90％以上的社员增加了收入。他说，如果没有人民公社，这是根本办不到的。今年，全社十一万五千亩耕地，全部可以实现自流灌溉。他表示有充分信心实现以粮为纲，农林牧副渔更好地全面地持续跃进。
    重庆市人民委员会委员刘昆水说，重庆市郊区的人民公社在生产蔬菜，保证城市副食品供应上显示了巨大的优越性。重庆郊区去年共建成了三十四万五千亩蔬菜生产基地，蔬菜总产量比1958年增加了28％。因而保证了城区每人每天可以吃到一斤以上的蔬菜。政协黑龙江省委员会副主席杜光预说，黑龙江省实现人民公社化以后，畜牧业生产的发展出现了前所未有的高速度。到1959年末，全省猪的头数比1958年同期增长了65％，大家畜增加了8.1％，羊增加了54％。拜泉县达到了一人一头猪，阿城县出现了“一猪产百仔”，安达县创造了“一羊年产五羔”的新纪录。他说，黑龙江省的畜牧业已经进入以猪为中心，畜牧业全面大发展，全部改良品种的新阶段，正在力争实现“五全五化”，即全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮和高产化、良种化、无疫化、基地化、机械化。目前，各人民公社正在大办牧场，并且展开了畜牧业生产的技术革新和技术革命运动，有的公社已经创造成功生猪饲养连续作业自动线。他表示完全拥护谭震林副总理的报告，要为进一步加速畜牧业的发展而努力。
    全国总工会书记处书记张修竹就发展职工教育和文化事业发言说，1958年大跃进以来，职工教育出现了大发展、大提高和持续向上的新局面。到1959年底，全国工矿企业职工参加业余学校学习的有一千六百多万人，今年2月又增加到一千九百多万人，不少地区青壮年职工中有三分之二以上的人经常参加学习。他说，职工教育和文化活动要紧紧跟上持续跃进的形势，就必须在现有的基础上进一步发展、巩固和提高，在最近一两年内基本扫除现有青壮年职工中的文盲，普及初等教育，大办业余中专、大专学校。在职工文化艺术活动方面，职工都以高度的热情歌颂总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝，歌颂技术革命和文化革命，今后应当通过各种形式发展文艺活动。
    中国科学院机械研究所副所长吴学蔺谈到我国机械科学研究情况。他说，两年来，在全党全民大搞科学研究的形势下，全国机械科学研究机构成倍地增加，很多学校、企业设有机械研究机构，很多人民公社也在进行简易的农机、运输工具、动力机械等研究工作。仅在农业机械研究方面，就创造了大量适合我国各地区不同耕作条件的新式农具和农业机器，水稻插秧机在国内外都获得了好评。他说，我们科学工作者一定要用毛泽东思想武装自己，解放思想，为争取在比较短的时间内实现十二年科学技术规划，攀登世界科学高峰而奋斗。九三学社中委乔启明说，科学研究工作应坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大兴协作之风，紧密结合生产。他以培育农作物优良品种为例，全国各地从解放以来培育推广的两千四百余个农作物新品种中，由劳动群众选育培养出来的占三分之二，比解放前二十六年中，由农业专家培育的品种多十倍以上。这个对比说明，科学研究只有在党的领导下，走群众路线，才能获得显著的成果。
    民盟中常委刘清扬发言，介绍了河北省各民主党派成员和无党派民主人士贯彻和风细雨的精神进行思想改造的情况。她说，许多民主党派的成员和高级知识分子，参观了城市、工业建设和农村人民公社、水利工程以后反映说：到处都看到了党的总路线的强大威力，并且为工人、农民的冲天干劲所感动，因而提高了思想觉悟。她认为，在国家社会主义建设事业一浪高一浪飞跃发展的形势下，加紧思想改造具有重大意义。在思想改造中，必须正确地理解和风细雨、正面教育的方法，不能把和风细雨和批评与自我批评分开，和风细雨是为了实现更好的根本改造。
    全国工商联副主任委员荣毅仁说，他在各地参观工厂、人民公社时看到，工人、农民对党和社会主义事业表现无限忠诚和热爱，自己很受感动。他说，在技术革新和技术革命运动中涌现出的大量发明创造，绝大多数是普通的工人和农民做出来的，并且这些工人农民都不计较个人得失，一心一意要把国家建设成为繁荣、富强、幸福的社会主义社会。这就是劳动人民和资产阶级知识分子的根本区别。他认为，工商业者要做到“顾一头”、“一边倒”，就必须以劳动人民为具体的学习榜样。
    委员董其武、陈明仁、陶峙岳在联合发言中，把新中国的财政工作和旧中国的财政工作做了对比。他们说，我国社会主义建设新时期中的财政工作特点是：多收入，多支出，多建设；更多地收入，更多地支出，更多地建设。我们回想国民党反动统治时期的财政情况，可以概括为：多压榨，多中饱，多破坏；更多地压榨，更多地中饱，更多地破坏。这个对比说明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。他们最后说，现在我国大陆上是一片红光，但是美帝国主义还霸占我国领土台湾，还必须继续坚持对国内外敌人的斗争，为解放台湾而努力。
    在今天大会上发言或书面发言的还有：周培源、黄方刚、李学海、任芝铭、杜孟模、陈鹤琴、袁金璋、黄德茂、傅懋勣、郑晓沧、黄振勋、徐长勋、尤家骏、王大珩、王少岩、黄鱼门、刁沼芬、叶宝珊、吴觉农、陈邃衡、经叔平、卢宗澄、涂羽卿、光升、陈云章、郑辟疆、吴天保、赵宗燠、苗海南、张蔚岑、朱蕴山、余名钰、周新民、闻家驷、曾泽生、张纪元、黄长水、黄鼎臣、王源兴、梁金山、王一知、王纪元、周铮、田心、钟惠澜、李平衡、袁敦礼、刘多荃、宋云彬、曾昭抡、李伯球。
    至此，大会讨论已经结束。五天来，共有三百一十四人在大会讨论中作了发言或书面发言。明天上午，会议分组讨论谭震林副总理的报告，下午列席全国人民代表大会会议。
