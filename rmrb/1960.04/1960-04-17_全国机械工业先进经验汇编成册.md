Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 16th: The First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and relevant departments in Chongqing organized a large number of people to extensively collect a large amount of advanced experience emerging from the mechanical industry in the technical innovation movement at the National Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Chongqing On-the-Spot Conference. They gathered and analyzed and sorted out the data of these advanced technical experiences, and carried out preliminary supporting and improvement work, and compiled ten albums including "Automatic Production Line," "Single Machine Automation of Metal Cutting Machine Tools," "Fitter Mechanization," "High-Efficiency Fixtures," and "Advanced Cutting Tools," totaling more than 1.4 million words, and also attached nearly 2,000 pictures.

At the Chongqing on-the-spot conference, representatives from various regions and industries brought the extremely rich experience of technical innovation and technical revolution created by the broad masses of the people across the country. It was a good opportunity to widely collect and sort out these advanced experiences during the conference. Because there were many representatives from the machinery industry participating in this conference, the conference leading group regarded the collection and sorting of advanced experiences of the mechanical system as an important task of the conference.

In the work of sorting out and summarizing these materials, the comrades of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry implemented the principle of combining the long-term with the short-term, prioritizing the short-term, focusing on collecting materials that reflected the direction of development, and extensively and deeply collecting experiences urgently needed in current practical work. For example, when sorting out the "Single Machine Automation of Metal Cutting Machine Tools" album, from the materials sent by various places, there was a lot of information on program control, but relatively little information on mechanically controlled automated machine tools that could be developed on a large scale at present. In order to meet the needs of practical work, they conducted in-depth interviews during the conference and actively collected a lot of information on mechanically controlled automated machine tools. The experience included in the album included not only data on foreign equipment, but also data on indigenous and simple equipment, and also included data on semi-indigenous and semi-foreign equipment. Therefore, these albums are of great reference value to various types of mechanical enterprises. In terms of the form of editing, the principle of starting from practical use was implemented as much as possible, and the experiences were classified by purpose in the arrangement of the experiences, which provided convenience for the broad masses of workers to apply these experiences. For example, in the high-efficiency fixture album, it was not classified by structure as pneumatic fixtures, electric fixtures, hydraulic fixtures, etc.; but was arranged in the order of lathe fixtures, planer fixtures, etc. In this way, it is convenient for the broad masses of workers to read and adopt, and a turner can find various advanced experiences of lathe fixtures by simply opening this section.

    全国机械工业先进经验汇编成册
    新华社重庆16日电　第一机械工业部和重庆市有关部门组织大批力量，在全国技术革新和技术革命重庆现场会议上，广泛搜集了机械工业在技术革新运动中涌现出来的大量先进经验。他们把这些先进技术经验的资料汇集起来，加以分析整理，并且作了初步配套提高的工作，编出了“自动生产线”、“金属切削机床单机自动化”、“钳工机械化”、“高效率夹具”、“先进刀具”等十个专辑共一百四十多万字，另外还附了将近二千幅图片。
    在重庆现场会议上，各地区各行业的代表，带来了全国广大群众所创造的技术革新和技术革命极其丰富的经验，在会议期间广泛搜集和整理这些先进经验，是一个良好的时机。由于参加这次会议的代表中机械行业的代表较多，因此，会议领导小组便把搜集和整理机械系统的先进经验当作大会的一项重要工作。
    在整理、总结这些资料的工作中，一机部的同志贯彻了远近结合、以近为先的原则，既着重搜集了体现发展方向的资料，又广泛深入地搜集了当前实际工作中急需的经验。例如在整理“金属切削机床单机自动化”专辑时，从各地送来的材料看，程序控制方面的资料很多，而当前可以大量发展的机械控制的自动化机床的资料却比较少。为了满足现实工作的需要，他们就在会议期间深入采访，积极地搜集了许多机械控制的自动化机床的资料。在纳入专辑的经验中，既包括了大洋设备的资料，也包括了土法简易设备的资料，并且还包括了半土半洋设备的资料。因此，这些专辑，对各种类型的机械企业，都有很大参考价值。在编辑的形式上，尽可能地贯彻了从实用出发的原则，在经验的编排上按用途分类，为广大工人群众应用这些经验提供了方便。例如在高效率夹具专辑中，就没有按结构分类为气动夹具、电动夹具、液压夹具等；而是按照车床夹具、刨床夹具等次序进行了编排。这样，就便利了广大工人群众阅读和采用，一个车工只要翻开这一段，就可以找到车床夹具的各种先进经验。
