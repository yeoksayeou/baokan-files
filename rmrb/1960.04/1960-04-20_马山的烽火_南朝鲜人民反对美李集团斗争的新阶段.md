    The struggle of the Korean people against the US-Syngman Rhee clique is unfolding vigorously, forming a prairie fire. The uprising of tens of thousands of people in Masan from April 11th to 13th against the Syngman Rhee fascist rule marked a new high tide in this struggle, entering a new stage. The beacon fire of the Masan people's uprising broke through the dark clouds of the US-Syngman Rhee clique's terror rule that shrouded South Korea, summoning the South Korean people to rise up for a more resolute battle.

    "Better to Fight Standing Up Than Die Sitting Down"
    The uprising of the Masan people and the development of the South Korean people's struggle against the US-Syngman Rhee clique are the inevitable result of the US-Syngman Rhee clique's fascist colonial rule. South Korea, which has been exploited, oppressed, and plundered by the US-Syngman Rhee clique for fifteen years, has become a veritable hell on earth. Industry and agriculture have been completely bankrupted, about half of the people with labor power are unemployed or semi-unemployed, millions of farmers eat grass roots and tree bark every spring, students become unemployed upon graduation, and small and medium-sized enterprises are collapsing one after another under the impact of surplus US goods. The broad masses of people really cannot survive.

    "Better to fight standing up than die sitting down!" This is the unanimous conclusion reached by the broad masses of people in South Korea today.

    In addition, Syngman Rhee's fascist rule has deprived the South Korean people of even the most basic democracy and freedom. During the sham presidential "election" on March 15th this year, Syngman Rhee ordered his police and secret agents to force the people to vote for him with knives and guns. The Masan people could no longer tolerate it and held a demonstration of more than 10,000 people on the same day against the "fraudulent election." However, the inhuman Syngman Rhee ordered the police to open fire on the demonstrating masses who were fighting for their legitimate rights, resulting in the deaths of twenty-six people and the wounding of eighty-six people. The streets of Masan were filled with blood. In front of the Masan Police Station alone, eight young students were shot dead on the spot. The Rhee puppet police also arrested a large number of people, using levers, pulling out fingernails, branding bodies with red-hot irons, and using various tortures to interrogate them.

    Not only that, but in order to cover up the evidence, the Rhee puppet police also threw the bodies of some of the people who had been killed into the sea. On April 11th, the body of a young student, Kim Joo-yeol, who had been killed by the police and thrown into the sea, was found on the coast near Masan. But the Rhee puppet police, under the pretext of an "autopsy," moved the body into the Provincial Hospital. Upon hearing this news, more than 1,000 students and citizens of Masan went there to demand that Kim Joo-yeol's body be handed over to them. When even this request was refused, old and new hatreds exploded like a heavy bomb in the hearts of the Masan people.

    "Syngman Rhee Regime, Step Down"

    The uprising struggle began at 6:10 p.m. on April 11th. When a demonstration of more than 1,000 students and citizens marched on the streets of Masan, and the slogan "Syngman Rhee regime, step down!" resounded through Masan, students, workers, citizens, teenagers and gray-haired old women poured out from every street corner of Masan and joined the ranks of the uprising. In less than two hours, more than 20,000 people had gathered.

    People know that Syngman Rhee is an executioner covered in blood. Syngman Rhee kills people like flies. Anyone who says a bad word about Syngman Rhee or mentions the four words "peaceful reunification" will be arrested or killed.

    However, on this day, tens of thousands of heroic Masan people, regardless of men, women, old or young, from all walks of life, stood up to face the muzzles of the Rhee puppet police, shouting "Syngman Rhee regime, step down!", "Lee Ki-poong (Syngman Rhee's confidant) should die!", and "Arrest the murdering police officers!".

    This uprising showed that the South Korean people's past scattered economic struggles and the struggles of various classes and strata for freedom and rights have been transformed into a political movement with the participation of the broad masses of people that is directly opposed to Syngman Rhee's fascist rule.

    Like all the South Korean people, the Masan people hate the Syngman Rhee clique to the bone. The uprising struggles on the nights of the 11th and 12th reached a climax. Tens of thousands of insurgents, like a rolling sea tide, surrounded the Masan "government" of the Rhee puppet regime, the Masan Police Station and various police stations, the Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party headquarters, the residences of Liberal Party congressmen, the Masan branch of the Liberal Party's newspaper "Seoul News"... In short, all places related to Syngman Rhee were surrounded by the masses. The stones thrown by the masses fell like rain, and these places were destroyed in an instant.

    Unite and Fight Resolutely
    The uprising of the Masan people, who heroically and stubbornly persisted in the struggle for three days, prominently demonstrated the power of the South Korean people uniting in the anti-US and anti-Rhee struggle.

    When the students marched in the streets in formation, the citizens in the streets applauded and cheered them. When students, workers, and citizens fought with the police who suppressed the masses with water cannons and tear gas and opened fire on the masses, women carried stones for them at the entrances of the alleys. When the mother of the young student Kim Joo-yeol, who was killed, rushed to Masan from afar, more than 500 Masan women went with her to the Provincial Hospital where Kim Joo-yeol's body was placed, to fight against the Rhee puppet police and curse the Syngman Rhee clique. On the first day of the uprising, the Rhee puppet police arrested some of the insurgents, but more insurgents, shouting "Release them immediately!", surged in like a huge wave, scaring the police into releasing the people they had arrested at that time.

    In this way, people from all walks of life united into a mighty army of insurgents, relying on the power of unity to break through the Rhee puppet police's so-called "iron-barrel-like cordon," stormed into the Masan Police Station, burned the police chief's jeep, seized the police's carbines and grenades, and used grenades to injure more than a dozen policemen. Even the chief of the Masan Police Station was beaten unconscious by the masses, and the chief of the South Gyeongsang Province Rhee puppet police bureau was beaten by the masses and hid under the table. The Rhee puppet police, who were regarded by Syngman Rhee as the panacea for fascist rule, were completely stripped of their prestige in front of the Masan people.

    Prairie Fire
    The Masan people raised high the beacon fire of the uprising, scaring the US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique out of their wits, and summoning the South Korean people to rise up and fight more heroically to overthrow the Syngman Rhee clique's traitorous rule. At present, the people in various parts of South Korea have risen up in response. Students and people in Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Dongnae and other places have held large-scale demonstrations of thousands of people. They are learning from the heroic fighting example of the Masan people, condemning the Syngman Rhee clique's suppression of the Masan people, and the struggle against the Syngman Rhee fascist rule, just like a prairie fire, is rapidly spreading from Masan to the entire South Korea.

    马山的烽火
    ——南朝鲜人民反对美李集团斗争的新阶段
    新华社记者　王玉章
    朝鲜人民反对美李集团的斗争正在如火如荼地展开，形成烈火燎原之势。马山市数万人民从4月11日到13日举行的反对李承晚法西斯统治的起义，标志着这一斗争推向一个新高潮，进入了一个新阶段。马山人民起义的烽火，冲破了笼罩在南朝鲜上空的美李集团恐怖统治的黑云，召唤着南朝鲜人民起来进行更坚决的战斗。
    “坐着死不如站起来战斗”
    马山人民的起义和南朝鲜人民反对美李集团斗争的发展是美李集团法西斯殖民统治的必然结果。被美李集团盘剥、压榨、掠夺了十五年的南朝鲜，已经变成了一座名副其实的人间地狱。工农业已完全破产，有劳动力的人有一半左右失业或半失业，每年春季有数百万农民以草根树皮果腹，学生们毕业即失业，中小企业者在美国剩余商品的打击下纷纷倒闭破产。广大人民实在活不下去了。
    “坐着死不如站起来战斗”！这就是今天南朝鲜广大人民一致得出的结论。
    另外，李承晚的法西斯统治已把南朝鲜人民最起码的民主、自由都剥夺干净。今年3月15日进行伪总统“选举”时，李承晚又命令他的警察、特务用刀枪逼着人民投他的票。马山人民忍无可忍，在当天举行了一万多人的反对“欺骗选举”的示威。但是灭绝人性的李承晚竟命令警察向争取合法权利的示威群众开枪，结果打死了群众二十六人，打伤了八十六人。马山街上流满了鲜血，仅在马山警察署前就有八个年幼的学生当场被打死。李伪警察还把大批人民逮捕起来，压杠子，扒指甲，用烧红的铁烙身体，用种种毒刑拷问。
    不仅如此，李伪警察为了灭迹，还把一些被打死的群众的尸首扔到海里去。4月11日，一个被警察打死后就被扔到海里的青年学生金周烈的尸体在马山附近海边被发现了。但李伪警察又以“解剖”为借口把尸体搬进了道立医院。听到这一消息的马山学生、市民一千多人就到那里要求把金周烈的尸体交给他们。当连这样的要求也被拒绝的时候，新仇旧恨就像重磅炸弹一样在马山人民的心中爆炸了。
    “李承晚政权滚下台来”
    起义斗争从4月11日下午六时十分开始。当一千多名学生和市民的示威队伍在马山街上行进，“李承晚政权滚下台来！”这一口号在马山响彻云霄的时候，学生、工人、市民、十几岁的少年儿童和白发苍苍的老太太，从马山的每个街头巷口涌出来，参加了起义的队伍。在不到两小时内就聚集了两万多人。
    人们都知道，李承晚是一个浑身沾满了鲜血的刽子手。李承晚杀人如麻，任何一个人只要讲李承晚一句坏话，或提到“和平统一”四个字就会被逮捕或杀头。
    可是，这一天数万名英勇的马山人民，不分男女老幼各界各层，挺起胸膛迎着李伪警察的枪口，高呼“李承晚政权滚下台来！”、“李起鹏（李承晚亲信）该死！”、“把杀人的警官抓起来！”。
    这次起义表明，南朝鲜人民由过去分散进行的经济斗争和各阶级各阶层分别进行的争取自由和权利的斗争，已经转变成为一个有广大人民参加的直接反对李承晚法西斯统治的政治运动。
    像全体南朝鲜人民一样，马山人民对李承晚集团已经恨至入骨，11日晚和12日晚起义斗争达到了高潮，数万名起义群众，像滚滚的海潮一样，包围了李伪政权的马山市“政府”、马山警察署和各个派出所、李承晚的自由党党部、自由党国会议员的住宅、自由党的机关报“汉城新闻”马山支社……总之，所有同李承晚沾亲带骨的地方都被群众包围了。群众扔出的石头像雨点般落下来，这些地方霎时间就被捣毁。
    团结起来坚决斗争
    英勇顽强地坚持了三天斗争的马山人民的起义，突出地显示了南朝鲜人民在反美反李斗争中团结起来的力量。
    在学生们排着队伍在街上示威游行的时候，街上的市民们鼓掌喝采支持他们。当学生、工人、市民同用水龙、催泪弹镇压群众、并向群众开枪的警察搏斗的时候，妇女们在巷口上为他们搬运石头。当被打死的青年学生金周烈的母亲由远路赶到马山来时，有五百多名马山妇女同她一起到停放金周烈的尸体的道立医院去，同李伪警察斗争，咒骂李承晚集团。在起义的第一天，李伪警察逮捕了一些起义者，但更多的起义群众高呼着“立即释放”的口号，像巨浪一样涌来，吓得警察只好把当时逮捕的人释放了。
    就是这样，各界人民联合成为一支浩浩荡荡的起义大军，依靠团结的力量，冲破了李伪警察的号称“铁桶似的警戒网”，攻进了马山警察所，烧了警察所长的吉普车，夺来了警察的卡宾枪和手榴弹，并用手榴弹炸伤了十几名警察。连马山警察所所长也被群众打昏在地，庆尚南道的李伪警察局长被群众打得钻进了桌子底下。被李承晚看作是法西斯统治万能灵药的李伪警察，在马山人民面前完全被打掉了威风。
    星火燎原
    马山人民高高举起了起义的烽火，吓破了美帝国主义和李承晚集团的胆，召唤着南朝鲜人民起来为推翻李承晚集团的卖国统治而更加英勇的战斗。目前，南朝鲜各地人民纷纷起来响应，汉城、釜山、大丘、仁川、东莱等各地的学生和人民举行了成千成万人的大规模示威。他们学习马山人民英勇战斗的榜样，谴责李承晚集团对马山人民的镇压，反对李承晚法西斯统治的斗争，正如燎原大火从马山迅速地燃遍了全南朝鲜。
