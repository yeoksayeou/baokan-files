    A Radiant Group Portrait

    To sing the praises of the spirit of our great era, to sing the praises of the communist style of the people of our great era—this is the main theme of our current and future literary and artistic creations. The movie "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" closely grasps this point from real life and portrays it very truthfully, movingly, and profoundly. One of the greatest characteristics of the film, both ideologically and artistically, is that, as in the "Pinglu Incident," the various people who appear in the film represent the collective within our socialist family.

    People see some famous artists and some less familiar artists (like the actors from the Shanxi Provincial Cultural Troupe and the Pinglu Pu Opera Troupe) in the film. The task they undertook in this performance was very glorious, yet also very arduous: they had to express the rich thoughts and feelings and the noble style and sentiment of the characters they played in a very short "space," sometimes even in a single shot or a few "words." This is admirable, and these artists did indeed complete this task: through their extremely concise, simple, and moving performances, they depicted some radiant portraits of ordinary heroes. It is precisely this group portrait, shimmering with new ideas and new moral light, that moves and encourages each of us, providing people with profound education and models for learning.

    When the county Party secretary played by Comrade Zhang Ping appears on the screen, it is not difficult for people to recall the images of those respectable grassroots Party leaders they have met in life. In this way, this character feels particularly close to people and inspires deep thought. That is: what I saw was not only the county Party secretary who, during the period of rural collectivization and people's communes, worked day and night selflessly to lead the masses in construction, but I seemed to see his past: in the struggle against the enemy, he wore a sheepskin coat, leading the armed work team, traversing mountains and ridges to fight guerrilla warfare. Here, Comrade Zhang Ping did not deliberately pursue some external things to portray this character; he focused on expressing the character's spiritual beauty and strength, that noble demeanor of constantly caring for the people, and those excellent characteristics of being calm and composed yet resolute and decisive in the face of events.

    There are many moving images in the film. For example, when a little nurse receives the phone call about the plane delivering medicine, the actor expresses the character's sincere deep feelings and emotional changes in just one shot, leaving a deep impression on people. Another example is an old man who, after his son is saved by an injection, speaks only a few words, but they are full of ideological and emotional content, sketching out a typical portrait of an old farmer in an old liberated area. Among a series of such characters, people cannot forget the images of young commercial workers created by Comrades Zhao Lian and Zhao Qiansun, who are like the Communist Youth League members we often see in our lives: energetic, unafraid of difficulties, optimistic, and confident; Comrade Yu Yang excellently created the role he played for the first time with only eight words in his entire "performance"; and many other actors also achieved certain successes in character shaping.

    At the same time, scenes like the plane taking off in the hazy moonlight, teams of militiamen carrying guns and setting off at a run, and millions of people craning their necks to wait for the "magic medicine" in the night sky; scenes like the three teams of migrant workers (all sixty-one people) appearing simultaneously at the three-way intersection, carrying flags and cheering as they rushed to the construction site; scenes like the lights on the boats in the Yellow River crossing at night, and the people on the shore anxiously watching—all express our collective protagonist. In these scenes, the directors and actors expressed far more than what was shown in the shots. These scenes, along with the music and lyrics, compose a magnificent communist symphony that evokes a huge response in our hearts and is unforgettable.

    I believe that the reason why these artists (including screenwriters, directors, actors, composers, lyricists, and photographers) were able to complete a group of heroic images in a very short time, at the fastest speed, and with extremely concise brushstrokes, is mainly because they themselves received a great education in this practice, and became closer to the heroes in their hearts, thus possessing a high degree of proletarian political enthusiasm and the most sincere and profound love and understanding for life and the characters.

    The rapid completion of this film and the enthusiastic welcome it has received from tens of thousands of viewers once again vividly proves the power of implementing the literary and artistic direction instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong. This is to promote the tradition of literature and art being closely integrated with politics and serving politics, and to implement the communist spirit of collaboration throughout the entire creative process. Seeing this film, we are convinced that our artists will be able to better follow this direction, go deep into reality, go deep among the masses, and further transform and improve their thinking; in this way, they will be able to better draw rich nourishment and an inexhaustible source of creation from the great life of our great era, thereby creating the newest and most beautiful works.

    光辉的群像
    贾霁
    歌颂我们伟大的时代精神，歌颂我们伟大时代人民的共产主义风格，这是我们当前和今后文艺创作的主要主题。电影“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”从现实生活中紧紧地抓住了这一点，描写得很真实、很动人、很有深度。影片在思想上艺术上最大的特色之一，是在于犹如在“平陆事件”中一样，在影片中出现的各式各样的人，表现了我们社会主义大家庭中的集体。
    人们在电影中看到了一些著名的艺术家和一些还不熟悉的艺术家（像山西文工团和平陆蒲剧团的演员）。他们在这次演出中担负的任务十分光荣，然而又是多么艰巨：他们几乎是要在很短的“篇幅”里，有时甚至是在一个镜头或者几个“字句”里，表现他们所扮演的人物的丰富的思想感情和高尚的风格、情操。这是令人感激的，这些艺术家确实完成了这样的任务：通过他们极端简炼、质朴而动人的表演，描绘出了一些光辉的普通的英雄的肖像。正是这闪烁着新的思想、新的道德的光辉的群像，激动着鼓舞着我们每一个人，使人们得到了深刻的教育和学习的榜样。
    当张平同志扮演的县委书记出现在银幕上的时候，人们不难想起曾在生活中遇见过的那些可敬的党的基层领导者的形象。正是这样，这个人物使人特别感到亲切，而且引人深思。这就是：我所看到的还不止是在农村合作化、人民公社化的时期夜以继日地忘我地领导群众进行建设的县委书记，我似乎看到了他的过去：在对敌斗争中，他披着羊皮袄，领着武工队，翻山越岭打游击的情景。张平同志在这里没有刻意去追求一些外在的东西来描画这个人物，他着重表现的是人物的精神的美和力量、那种无时无刻不在关心人民的崇高的风貌和那种遇事沉着镇定而又坚决果断的优秀的特征。
    影片中动人的形象很多。像有个小护士在她接到了飞机送药来的电话的时候，就只在一个镜头里，演员也表现了人物，那真挚的深情和情绪的变化，给人留下了深刻的印象。又像一个老大爷在他的儿子打针获救之后，也只有几句话，却充满了思想感情内容，把一个老解放区老农民典型的肖像勾画出来。在一系列这样的人物中，人们不能忘记赵联和赵钱孙这两位同志所创造的年轻的商业工作人员的形象，他们如同在我们生活中经常见到的共青团员一样：生气勃勃，不怕困难，乐观而自信；于洋同志在他全部“戏”里面只有八个字就出色地创造了他第一次扮演的角色；而其余的许多演员，也都在人物塑造上获得了一定的成绩。
    同时，像在月色蒙胧中飞机凌空而起，一队队民兵扛着枪跑步出发，以及千万人翘首夜空等待“神药”的那一系列场景；像在三岔路上同时出现的三队民工（都是六十一个人），扛着旗、欢呼着奔赴工地的场景；像黄河夜渡中船上的灯火明灭，岸上的人们紧张地了望的场景——都表现了我们的集体的主人公。在这些场景里，导演和演员表现出来的决不止是镜头里所表现了的东西。这些场面和音乐、歌词，组成了一首宏伟的共产主义的交响乐，在我们心里引起了巨大的反响，经久难忘。
    我相信，这些艺术家（包括编剧、导演、演员、作曲、作词、摄影师）所以能在极短的时间里，用最快的速度和用极其简炼的笔触，完成了一群英雄的形象，主要就是因为他们自己在这次实践中受到了很大的教育，在内心上更接近了英雄，因而有了高度的无产阶级的政治热情，有了对于生活、对于人物的最真切而深刻的热爱和理解。
    这部电影的迅速拍成并获得成千成万观众的热烈欢迎，又一次生动地证明了执行毛泽东同志所指示的文艺方向的力量。这就是发扬了文艺紧密结合政治、为政治服务的传统，并且是在整个创作过程中贯彻了共产主义的协作精神。看到了这部电影，使我们确信：我们的艺术家必能更好地遵循这一方向，深入实际，深入群众，进一步改造和提高思想；这样就必能更好地从我们伟大时代的伟大生活中汲取到丰富的营养和用之不尽的创作源泉，从而创作出最新最美的作品来。
