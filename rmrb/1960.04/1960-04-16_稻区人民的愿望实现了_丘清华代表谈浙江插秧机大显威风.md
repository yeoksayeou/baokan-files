I fully support the various reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Since the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the great call to basically realize the agricultural mechanization of our country in about ten years, the broad masses of people in Zhejiang Province, like all parts of the country, immediately responded enthusiastically with practical actions, and a magnificent upsurge of agricultural technological innovation and technological revolution quickly formed. In this upsurge, the experimental research and promotion of rice transplanters have greatly leaped forward.

The "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture requires early rice planting, close planting, and the implementation of early and late rice double cropping. However, the seasonality of early and late rice transplanting is very strong, and at the same time, other farm work is very busy during transplanting, so labor is extremely tight. According to past experience, the earliness or lateness of transplanting time has a great impact on yield, especially for double-cropped late rice, with yield differences visible even with a one-day difference. Therefore, it is necessary to race against time and seize the transplanting season. However, manual transplanting requires a lot of labor, and one cannot take care of other farm work when transplanting. The farmers felt very embarrassed by this problem, saying, "When the tea is picked, the seedlings are too long; when the seedlings are transplanted, the tea is too old." Therefore, replacing manual transplanting with machines and realizing mechanized or semi-mechanized transplanting is a long-cherished wish of the broad masses of farmers, and also an objective requirement for the sustained great leap forward in agriculture.

In order to solve this problem, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of people in our province began experimental research on rice transplanters in 1956. Over the past few years, more than 50 types of rice transplanters have been created, including the "Yuyao Yuejin (Leap Forward) Model," "Ningbo Innovation Model," "Fenghua Style," "Jiaxing Nanhu Commune 59-4 Model," and "Pingyang 44 Model." A number of them were promoted last year, with good results. This year, on the basis of last year, we have successfully trial-produced three types of rice transplanters: "Zhejiang No. 1," "Zhejiang No. 2," and "Zhejiang No. 3." "Zhejiang No. 1" was successfully trial-produced by the rice transplanter experimental research team of our province in Hainan Island in January. After large-scale trial transplanting there, it proved to have good performance. Its advantages are simple structure, easy operation, not easy to deform, and the uniformity (referring to five to eight seedlings per hole) is stable at more than 85%, with a maximum of 96%. It can transplant three to four mu per day, which is five to six times more efficient than manual transplanting. Because the height of the frame can be adjusted at any time, and it is equipped with three different sizes of seedling claws, it can adapt to seedlings as short as three inches and as long as one foot and two inches. "Zhejiang No. 2" (i.e., Zhejiang Agricultural No. 4) was created by the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, using an electric rope traction machine for pulling (or animal power can also be used). It can transplant 20 to 30 mu per day, with good quality, and can adapt to early, middle, and late rice. At the national rice transplanter evaluation meeting, it was rated as one of the rice transplanters to be promoted nationwide. "Zhejiang No. 3" was created by Shengxian County. It has a bamboo and wood structure and uses very little steel. The machine body weighs only 18 kilograms. It is easy to operate and inexpensive, and is most suitable for use in mountain terraces, and is very popular among the masses. These three types of rice transplanters have their own characteristics. According to the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, we are vigorously promoting them in accordance with local conditions. Now, a mass movement to vigorously develop rice transplanters has been rapidly launched. The worker comrades are making great efforts in technological innovation, fighting day and night to rush-produce rice transplanters to support spring plowing. By the end of March, more than 40,000 units had been manufactured throughout the province. Training classes are being held everywhere in rural areas to actively train rice transplanter operators. In areas with early seasons, rice transplanters have already begun to show their power.

The successful research and development and mass manufacturing and promotion of rice transplanters means that the era of manual bending and transplanting is coming to an end. This is a great revolution in paddy field farming tools and also a great revolution in rice cultivation. After the goal of manufacturing and promoting 200,000 rice transplanters this year is achieved, about 8 million mu of paddy fields in the province will realize semi-mechanized transplanting, which can significantly alleviate the tight labor situation during the transplanting season. If we make another effort next year, we can basically realize semi-mechanized rice transplanting. This is of great significance for seizing the season and ensuring close planting. The farmers are very happy and encouraged by the success of the rice transplanters. They sing:

For generations, we have transplanted rice by hand,
Facing the soil and with our backs to the sky,
Leaving at dawn and working until late,
Barely half a mu transplanted in a day.
Now we use machines to transplant rice,
Holding the "crank" like immortals,
Millennial wishes turn into reality,
Production leaps forward with endless joy.

Like any new thing, the experimental research process of rice transplanters is a process of struggle. It was born and grew up in the struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking. When the research started in 1956, some people shook their heads and said, "This thing is not simple. Foreign countries don't even have it yet, how can it be easy!" Because most of the people engaged in research were active workers and peasants, such as Lu Youkang in Yuyao and Zhang Chuandou in Pingyang, who were so-called "country bumpkins," some people ridiculed, "They can't even recognize a basketful of words, what are they doing with rice transplanters?" "A toad wants to eat swan meat, overestimating themselves." However, under the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, and under the leadership and support of Party committees at all levels, the people engaged in experimental research were still full of energy and worked diligently, without any discouragement. Therefore, the experimental research work of rice transplanters progressed rapidly. In a short period of time, all kinds of rice transplanters appeared like mushrooms after a rain. The rice transplanters manufactured and promoted last year had good results. However, since the rice transplanters were born not long ago, it is inevitable that there were some shortcomings. It is not surprising that new things are not perfect at the beginning. But some people seized on this and shouted "waste of money and manpower," saying that rice transplanters were "angry machines." During the anti-Rightist rectification movement, facts were presented and reasons were explained, giving a powerful criticism to these erroneous remarks. The facts are very clear. According to a survey of 19 typical examples in 10 counties (cities) of Ningbo, Yuyao, Longyou, Lishui, and Pinghu, under the same conditions, the rice yield transplanted by rice transplanters last year was higher than that of manual transplanting. The Jinxing Production Team of Gulin Commune in Ningbo City transplanted 347 mu with machines last year, and the yield was 9.9% higher than that of manual transplanting. In the face of facts, the opponents had to admit defeat, and the doubters also sobered up. The three types of rice transplanters finalized this year have been greatly improved and enhanced compared to the previous rice transplanters, and some of the shortcomings that existed last year have been improved. We can say that the rice transplanter, born and grown up in struggle, is the crystallization of the wisdom of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and technicians throughout the province, and a "work" of great collective creation. This is the victory of the Party's general line for building socialism, and the victory of the Party's mass line.

The successful research and development of rice transplanters is only the beginning of the mechanization of the entire rice transplanting process. We should continue to move forward non-stop with the spirit of continuous revolution. The three types of rice transplanters that have now been finalized must be further improved and enhanced, especially to learn and absorb the advantages of rice transplanters in fraternal regions, so as to make them increasingly perfect. In manufacturing and promotion, we must grasp the quality control, so that each unit meets the specifications and is durable. At the same time, we must quickly create a complete set of semi-mechanized and mechanized seedling pulling, washing, sorting, and transporting machines, so that innovation becomes complete and systematic. Now, the experimental research on seedling pulling machines has achieved initial results. Several types of seedling pulling machines have appeared in various parts of the province. Among them, the seedling pulling machine created by Yueqing has been initially successful. It is planned to hold an on-site meeting in the county recently to exchange experience, study improvements, and deploy manufacturing and promotion.

The success of rice transplanters proves that the broad masses of people in our country, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are invincible. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the cause of agricultural mechanization in our country will surely advance at high speed along the road to victory!

    稻区人民的愿望实现了
    丘清华代表谈浙江插秧机大显威风
    我完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和人大常委会所作的各项报告。
    自从党中央和毛主席提出争取在十年左右的时间内基本上实现我国农业机械化的伟大号召后，浙江省广大人民像全国各地一样，立即以实际行动热烈响应，一个波澜壮阔的农业技术革新和技术革命的高潮迅速形成。在这个高潮中，水稻插秧机的试验研究和推广工作，大大跃进了一步。
    农业“八字宪法”要求水稻早插、密植和实行早、晚稻连作。但早稻晚稻插秧的季节性都十分强烈，同时插秧时其他农活也都很繁忙，因此劳力极为紧张。根据以往经验，插秧时间的早迟，对产量影响很大，特别是连作晚稻，相差一天产量也见高低。因此就必须分秒必争，抢住插秧季节。可是手工插秧花劳力大，顾了插秧顾不了其他农活。农民对这个问题很感为难，他们说：“采得茶来秧太长，插得秧来茶又老”。因此，以机器代替手工插秧，实现插秧机械化、半机械化是广大农民多年来梦寐以求的愿望，也是农业持续大跃进的客观要求。
    为了解决这个问题，我省广大群众在党的领导下，从1956年起开始了插秧机的试验研究。几年来先后创造了“余姚跃进号”、“宁波革新号”、“奉化式”、“嘉兴南湖公社59—4型”、“平阳44型”等五十余种插秧机。去年开始推广了一批，效果良好。今年我们在去年的基础上试制成功了“浙江一号”、“浙江二号”和“浙江三号”三种插秧机。“浙江一号”是1月间我省插秧机试验研究小组在海南岛试制成功的。在那里经过大面积试插，证明性能良好，其优点是构造简单、操作轻便、不易变型、均匀度（指每穴五至八株）稳定在85％以上，最高达96％，每天可插三至四亩，比手工插秧提高工效五至六倍。由于机架高低可以随时调整，还备有三副大小不同的秧爪，因此能适应短至三寸、长达一尺二寸的秧苗。“浙江二号”（即浙农四号）是浙江农业科学研究所创制的，用电动绳索牵引机牵引（也可用牲口牵引），日插二十至三十亩，质量良好，早中晚稻都可适应。在全国插秧机评比会议上，被评为全国推广的插秧机之一。“浙江三号”是嵊县创造的，竹木结构，用钢材很少，机身仅重十八公斤，操作轻便、价格便宜，最适宜于山区梯田使用，很受群众欢迎。这三种插秧机各有特点，根据土洋并举方针，我们正因地制宜地大力推广。现在，一个大搞插秧机的群众性的运动已经迅速开展，工人同志们大闹技术革新，为赶制插秧机支援春耕而日夜奋战。到3月底止，全省已制成四万余台。农村中到处举办训练班，积极训练插秧机手。季节早的地区，插秧机已开始大显威风。
    插秧机的研究成功和大批制造推广，手工弯腰插秧的时代即将结束，这是水田农具的大革命，也是水稻栽培上的大革命。今年制造推广二十万台插秧机的目标达到后，全省约有八百万亩左右水田实现插秧半机械化，可以显著缓和插秧季节劳力紧张的情况。明年再努一把力，就可基本上实现水稻插秧半机械化。这对于抢住季节和保证密植有着十分重大的意义。农民对于插秧机的成功，十分欢欣鼓舞，他们歌唱：
    世世代代手插秧，面朝泥土背朝天，
    五更出门干到晚，一天难插半亩田。
    如今插秧用机器，手扶“摇杆”赛神仙，
    千年愿望变现实，生产跃进乐无边。
    和任何新事物一样，插秧机的试验研究过程，是一个斗争过程，它是在和右倾保守思想斗争中诞生和成长起来的。1956年开始研究时，就有人摇头说：“这玩艺儿不简单，外国至今还没有，谈何容易！”由于进行研究的多数是工农积极分子，如余姚的陆友康，平阳的张传斗，都是所谓“土包子”，有人就讥笑：“斗大的字认不得一箩筐，还搞什么插秧机”，“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉，不自量”。但是在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在各级党委的领导和支持下，试验研究的人们仍然是干劲十足、刻苦钻研，丝毫没有泄气。因此，插秧机的试验研究工作进展很快，短短时间，各式各样的插秧机，有似雨后春笋，纷纷出现。去年制造、推广的插秧机，效果是良好的。但由于插秧机诞生的时间不久，难免存在一些缺点。新事物开头不够完善，原是不足为奇的。可是有人就抓住不放，大叫“劳民伤财”，说插秧机是“生气机”。在反右整风运动中，摆事实讲道理，给这些错误言论以有力的批判。事实很明显，据宁波、余姚、龙游、丽水、平湖等十个县（市）十九个典型调查，在同样条件下，去年用插秧机插的水稻产量都比手插的高。宁波市古林公社金星生产队，去年机插三百四十七亩，产量比手插的高9.9％。在事实面前，反对的人只好服输，怀疑的人也清醒起来了。今年定型的三种插秧机，比以前的插秧机有很大改进和提高，去年存在的一些缺点，都改进过来了。我们可以说，在斗争中诞生和成长的插秧机，是全省广大工农群众和技术人员智慧的结晶，是大集体创作的“作品”。这是党的建设社会主义总路线的胜利，是党的群众路线的胜利。
    插秧机的研究成功，还只是整个水稻插秧过程机械化的开端，我们应该以不断革命的精神，马不停蹄地继续前进。现在已定型的三种插秧机，还必须进一步加以改进提高，特别要学习和吸收兄弟地区插秧机的优点，使之日益完善。在制造和推广中，要抓住质量一关，使台台合于规格，经久耐用。同时要迅速创造出一整套的半机械化、机械化的拔秧、洗秧、整秧、运秧机具，使革新成套成龙。现在拔秧机的试验研究已初获战果，全省各地已出现好几种拔秧机，其中乐清创造的拔秧机已初步成功。最近拟在该县召开现场会议，交流经验，研究改进和部署制造推广。
    水稻插秧机成功的事实，证明以毛泽东思想武装起来的我国广大人民是无往而不胜的。我们坚信，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，我国农业机械化事业必将沿着胜利的道路高速度地前进！
