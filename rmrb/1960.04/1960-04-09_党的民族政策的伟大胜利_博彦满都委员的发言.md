Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I fully agree with and enthusiastically support the work report of Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Consultative Conference, the report on the draft 1960 National Economic Plan by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and the report on the 1959 National Financial Statement and the draft 1960 National Budget by Vice Premier Li Xiannian.

    The comprehensive and continuous victories and extremely great achievements in all aspects of the motherland's socialist construction fill me with boundless excitement and encouragement. Now, I would like to talk about the great victory of the Party's ethnic policy in Inner Mongolia.

The Changes in Inner Mongolia During the Great Leap Forward

    Since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region more than twelve years ago, under the correct leadership of the Party, the great ethnic policy of the Party has been implemented, achieving regional autonomy with the Mongolian nationality as the main body. This has ended the situation of ethnic division, completely eliminated ethnic oppression and discrimination, and formed a truly equal, united, mutually supportive, and friendly ethnic family.

    "The sky is vast, the wilderness boundless; the wind blows, and the grass bows, revealing cattle and sheep." This was the backward state of Inner Mongolia in the past. The current situation is very different from the past. It is now vigorously carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, just like other provinces and regions in the country.

    In 1958, with the leap forward development of the national socialist construction cause, especially the realization of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region launched a high tide of socialist construction, resulting in a great leap forward in the entire national economy. In 1959, all production departments achieved continued great leap forward achievements on the basis of the 1958 Great Leap Forward. The total industrial and agricultural output value of the region increased by 32% compared with 1958, far exceeding the average growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period. Among the total industrial and agricultural output value, the industrial output value increased by more than 55% compared with 1958, and the total agricultural output value increased by more than 15% compared with 1958. It should be particularly pointed out that the total number of livestock in Inner Mongolia's animal husbandry, which ranks first in the country, has reached 28,024,000 head, an increase of 14.5% compared with 1958, and more than three times that before liberation. The output of other major products has increased several times or even several times. Compared with 1958, steel production (excluding native steel) increased fourfold, and pig iron production (excluding native iron) increased more than threefold. In particular, the No. 1 blast furnace of Baotou Steel flowed molten iron one year ahead of schedule, which not only played a significant role in the construction of Inner Mongolia but also had a very important significance for the country's socialist construction. Coal production increased by more than 41% compared with 1958, grain production increased by about 10% compared with 1958, and transportation, culture, education, and health have also made tremendous achievements. Therefore, all aspects of the region have shown a thriving situation. In this way, the socialist construction of the autonomous region has entered a new stage of high-speed, sustained leap forward. The Inner Mongolia Party Committee pointed out in a timely manner that, with the great development of the entire national construction, it is necessary to strive to basically realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and science and culture in a not-too-long period, and to build the autonomous region into a powerful base of iron and steel, grain, animal husbandry, and forestry of a considerable scale in the motherland. Thoroughly change the political, economic, and cultural outlook of the autonomous region, eliminate the de facto inequality between ethnic groups, and enable the Mongolian and other ethnic minorities in the region to quickly catch up with the level of advanced ethnic groups. Encouraged by this instruction, the people of all ethnic groups in the region have formed a new upsurge of socialist construction and are bravely advancing to seize the great victory of continued great leap forward in 1960.

The Party's Ethnic Policy Embody the Will and Aspirations of the People of Inner Mongolia

    Why has the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region been able to achieve such brilliant achievements in such a short period of more than twelve years? In my opinion, the first is the victory of the great ethnic policy of the Party and Chairman Mao. Under the correct leadership of the Party's ethnic policy, the policy of widely uniting the people of all ethnic groups and all classes in the people's democratic united front has been implemented. Due to the opposition to Han chauvinism and local nationalism. Originally, for more than a century, the imperialist aggression, the oppression of feudal forces, and the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism have closely linked the fate of the Inner Mongolia nation with the nations of the country. Facing common enemies, it is necessary to have unified leadership and united revolutionary forces. In particular, the experience of the Chinese revolution in the past 30 years has proved that the liberation and development of the Inner Mongolia nation is only possible under the unified leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with the victory of the national people's revolution and the construction of the new China. Local nationalists attempted to oppose the unified leadership of the Party and attempted to split the Inner Mongolia people from the inseparable family of Chinese ethnic groups. Their purpose was to continue to maintain the reactionary rule of the feudal upper class within the nation. This has been bankrupt by the opposition of the awakened Inner Mongolia people. Because the people see very clearly that if they leave the leadership of the Party, a series of democratic reforms and socialist construction in Inner Mongolia will inevitably be impossible to realize, and the people will not be able to get rid of the tragic fate of being oppressed and exploited.

    Based on the Marxist-Leninist ethnic theory combined with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, the Party and Chairman Mao formulated the policy of ethnic regional autonomy. This policy embodies the will and aspirations of the broad masses of the people of Inner Mongolia, so it was enthusiastically supported by the masses when it was first implemented. The implementation of this policy has enabled the Mongolian and other ethnic minorities in the region to fully obtain the democratic rights of being masters of their own affairs. With the continuous victory of the national socialist construction, the political, economic, cultural, educational, health and other undertakings of the autonomous region have been greatly developed, rapidly changing or are changing the poor and backward face.

    The decline in the ethnic population is a serious threat to the various ethnic minorities in the autonomous region. Therefore, on the day when the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government was established in 1947, the first call made by Chairman Ulanhu of the autonomous region was "We want people and livestock to prosper." Under the correct leadership of the Party and with the strong support of the central government, the health care and material and cultural living standards of the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region have been greatly improved, from population decline to population increase. Among them, the Mongolian population increased from more than 830,000 in 1946 to more than 1,130,000 in 1958. Therefore, the song that the people of the autonomous region are now singing is: A new atmosphere appears on the grassland, cattle and horses are fat and children are strong; the prosperity of people and livestock is so happy, thanks to the benefactor, the Communist Party.

Accelerate the Socialist Construction of Inner Mongolia

    Like rural and pastoral areas throughout the country, after the realization of people's communes in the autonomous region, further profound changes have taken place in the relations of production and the relations between ethnic groups. Because the people's communes have unprecedentedly liberated the productive forces, organized members of all ethnic groups together in production and life, jointly labored, strengthened mutual assistance and cooperation between ethnic groups and within ethnic groups, and given full play to the productive strengths of all ethnic groups. In this way, socialist ethnic relations have been further formed and developed. As a result, the socialist consciousness and communist consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups have also been unprecedentedly improved. In particular, the realization of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward has further encouraged the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups to build socialism. All of these are favorable conditions for sustained leap forward in the future, and are also the great victory of the Party's ethnic policy.

    Like all parts of the country, under the new situation of socialist construction, the future tasks of the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region are: to hold the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to hold the red banner of the Party's general line of building socialism even higher, to continue to improve the level of socialist consciousness and communist consciousness, to continuously consolidate and develop the relations of unity and cooperation among all ethnic groups, to actively carry out the technical revolution and cultural revolution movement, and to further push the construction of the economy and culture of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region onto the track of high-speed sustained leap forward.

    In order to accelerate the socialist construction of Inner Mongolia, it is extremely necessary to mobilize all positive factors and turn negative factors into positive factors. As democratic figures of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region, it is necessary to strengthen the fundamental work of self-transformation under the new situation of building socialism. After the rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and socialist education, most of the democratic figures have made great progress. "Listening to Chairman Mao's words and following the Communist Party" has almost become the universal voice of the democratic figures. However, I believe that the fundamental transformation of a person's political thought and standpoint is a long-term and complex process. Especially for those who have participated in the reactionary ruling group for many years in the old society, it cannot be solved by going through a few movements to carry out a thorough transformation. Therefore, we must redouble our efforts to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, continuously improve our ideological understanding, and actively participate in production labor, do our job well, and contribute more to the socialist construction of the country and the autonomous region together with the working people.

    党的民族政策的伟大胜利
    博彦满都委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意并热烈拥护陈叔通副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告，李富春副总理的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。
    祖国的社会主义建设，在全国各个方面全面的不断胜利和继续取得了极其伟大的成就，使我感到无限的兴奋和鼓舞。现在我谈一谈党的民族政策在内蒙古的伟大胜利。大跃进中内蒙古的变化
    内蒙古自治区成立十二年多以来，在党的正确领导下，贯彻执行了党的伟大的民族政策，实现了以蒙古民族为主体的区域自治，从而结束了民族分裂的局面，彻底消灭了民族压迫和民族歧视，形成了真正平等、团结、互助、友爱的民族大家庭。
    天苍苍，野茫茫，风吹草低见牛羊。这是过去内蒙古的落后状态。现在的情况和过去大不相同了，已经是与全国其他各省区一样，正在大力进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    1958年随着全国社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，尤其是大跃进和人民公社的实现，使自治区各族人民，掀起了建设社会主义的高潮，出现了整个国民经济的大跃进。1959年各个生产部门在1958年大跃进的基础上取得了继续大跃进的成就。全区工农业总产值比1958年增长32％，远远超过第一个五年计划期间平均增长的速度。在工农业总产值中，工业产值比1958年增长55％以上，农业总产值比1958年增长15％以上。在这里要特别指出在全国居第一位的内蒙古牧业牲畜总头数已达到二千八百零二万四千头，比1958年增长14.5％，比解放前增长了三倍以上。在其他主要产品产量上，有不少是成倍增长或几倍增长。与1958年比较，钢产量（不包括土钢）增长四倍，生铁产量（不包括土铁）增长三倍多，特别是包钢一号高炉提前一年流出了铁水，这不仅对内蒙古的建设起了重大的作用，对国家的社会主义建设也具有很重要的意义。煤的产量比1958年增长41％以上，粮食产量比1958年增长10％左右，交通运输文教卫生等方面，也都取得了巨大的成绩。因此，全区各方面呈现了欣欣向荣的大好形势。这样，使自治区的社会主义建设，进入了高速度持续跃进的新阶段。内蒙古党委及时地指出，要随着整个国家建设的大发展，争取在一个不太长的时间内，基本实现工业、农牧业和科学文化的现代化，把自治区建设成为祖国的一个相当规模的钢铁、粮食、畜牧业和林业的强大基地，彻底改变自治区政治经济和文化面貌，消灭民族间事实上的不平等，使蒙古族和区内各少数民族迅速赶上先进民族的水平。全区各族人民，在这一指示的鼓舞下、已经形成了社会主义建设的新高潮，正为着夺取1960年继续大跃进的伟大胜利奋勇前进。
    党的民族政策体现了内蒙古人民的意志和愿望
    内蒙古自治区为什么能够在这短短的十二年多的时间内获得这样辉煌的成就呢？在我看来，首先是在于党和毛主席的伟大民族政策的胜利。在党的民族政策的正确领导下，贯彻执行了广泛团结各民族、各阶层的人民民主统一战线的方针和政策，由于反对了大民族主义和地方民族主义。本来，从百余年来，帝国主义的侵略，封建势力的压迫和中国人民的反帝反封建的斗争，使内蒙古民族和国内各民族的命运密切结合在一起，面对着共同的敌人，须要有统一的领导和团结一致的革命力量，尤其近三十多年来中国革命经验证明，内蒙古民族的解放与发展，只有在中国共产党的统一领导下，随着全国人民大革命和新中国建设取得胜利的条件下，才有可能。地方民族主义者，企图反对党的统一领导，企图把内蒙古人民从中国各民族不可分离的大家庭内分裂出去。他们的目的是为了继续维持民族内部封建上层的反动统治。这一点已被觉悟的内蒙古人民的反对而告破产。因为人民看的很清楚，如果离开党的领导，内蒙古一系列的民主改革和社会主义建设必然无由实现，人民就摆不脱受压迫受剥削的悲惨命运。
    党和毛主席根据马列主义的民族理论结合中国革命的具体实践，制定了民族区域自治政策。这个政策，体现了内蒙古广大人民的意志和愿望，所以在开始实行的时候，就得到人民群众的热烈拥护。推行这一政策的结果，使蒙古民族和区内各少数民族充分得到了当家作主的民主权利。随着全国社会主义建设的不断胜利，自治区的政治、经济、文教、卫生等事业都得到了飞跃发展，迅速地改变了或正在改变着贫穷落后的面貌。
    民族人口下降是自治区各少数民族的严重威胁。所以在1947年内蒙古自治区人民政府成立那一天，自治区乌兰夫主席提出的第一个号召是“我们要人畜两旺”。这个号召，在党的正确领导和中央的大力帮助下，使自治区各族人民的卫生事业和物质文化生活水平得到了大大提高，从人口下降而人口上升，其中就蒙古民族人口来说，从1946年的八十三万多人上升到1958年的一百一十三万多人。因而自治区人民现在唱着的歌是：草原出现新气象，牛马肥来娃娃壮；人畜两旺多幸福，感谢恩人共产党。加速内蒙古的社会主义建设
    自治区农村和牧区与全国各地一样，实现了人民公社化后，生产关系和各民族间的关系发生了进一步的深刻变化。由于人民公社化而空前地解放了生产力，把各民族成员从生产和生活上组织在一起，共同劳动，加强了民族之间和民族内部的互助合作，而且发挥了各族人民的生产特长。这样，就进一步形成和发展了社会主义的民族关系。从而各族人民的社会主义觉悟和共产主义觉悟也空前提高，特别是全面大跃进的实现，更加鼓舞了各族人民建设社会主义的积极性，所有这些都是今后持续跃进的有利条件，也就是党的民族政策的伟大胜利。
    同全国各地一样，自治区各族人民在社会主义建设的新形势下，今后的任务是：更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，更高地举起党的建设社会主义总路线的红旗，继续提高社会主义觉悟和共产主义觉悟的水平，不断地巩固和发展各民族间的团结合作关系，积极开展技术革命和文化革命的运动，把自治区各民族经济、文化的建设更进一步推向高速度持续跃进的轨道上。
    为了加速内蒙古的社会主义建设，调动一切积极因素，化消极因素为积极因素是极其需要的。作为自治区各民族的民主人士来说，在这建设社会主义的新形势下，必须加强根本自我改造的工作。经过整风反右和社会主义教育，民主人士中的多数人都有很大进步，“听毛主席话，跟共产党走”几乎成了民主人士的普遍呼声。但是我认为一个人的政治思想和立场观点的根本改造，是一个长期的、复杂的过程，尤其是在旧社会曾多年参加反动统治集团的人，要想进行脱胎换骨的改造，不是经过几个运动就可解决的。因之我们必须加倍努力学习马列主义和毛主席著作，不断提高自己的思想认识，并且要积极参加生产劳动，做好自己的岗位工作，和劳动人民一起为国家和自治区的社会主义建设贡献更多的力量。
