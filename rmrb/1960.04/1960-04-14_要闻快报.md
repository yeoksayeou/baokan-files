    Guizhou Establishes Amateur Schools Based in Dining Halls
    Guizhou Province has established amateur schools integrating politics, culture, and technology, using dining halls as bases. The number of rural young and middle-aged people enrolled has reached more than 4.27 million, accounting for 95% of the total rural young and middle-aged population. The number of people persisting in learning during the busy spring plowing season is over 78.75%.
    Guizhou Province, through rectifying dining halls, has combined the dining hall, assembly hall, and classroom into one, making it a place for political, technical, and cultural education for the masses. Currently, many dining halls in the province have become centers for production teams to hold meetings to discuss production and conduct study and cultural entertainment activities, making the dining hall a warm family.
    Now, Guizhou is deeply studying, summarizing, and promoting the experience of running schools in dining halls, to further promote the development of farmers' amateur education.

    Hunan Launches a Shock Campaign to Eliminate Pests and Diseases
    Hunan Province is launching a vigorous shock campaign to improve sanitation, eliminate the four pests, and eradicate diseases. Currently, more than 10 million people in the province have joined the movement. In just four days, more than 2.05 million rats were caught and more than 30,000 catties of pupae were eliminated throughout the province.
    While vigorously eliminating the four pests and improving sanitation, 210,000 medical personnel and 22,815 medical teams across the province went deep into the front lines of production to carry out prevention, treatment, and health publicity work. Because various localities have strengthened disease eradication work, the incidence of disease in the province recently decreased by 94% compared with the same period last year. Twenty counties with basically no infectious diseases have emerged, and the attendance rate of commune members in large numbers has reached over 99%.

    Ji'an Prefecture Cadres Move to Poor Teams and Communes to Work
    The work style of party and government leading organs at all levels in Ji'an Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, has undergone a great change. Up to now, more than 3,000 staff members of organs throughout the area have left their offices and gone to the countryside, moving to poor communes, teams, or key communes and teams to work. More than 260 people's communes across the area have also achieved the goal of holding meetings and handling affairs in the fields, sitting in poor teams, and stepping on low-yield fields. From the secretary and members of the prefectural party committee to every cadre, everyone is equipped with three treasures: a bamboo hat, a raincoat, and a hoe.
    The great change in work style has powerfully promoted the current spring plowing production.

    Tianjin University Supports Agricultural Technical Transformation
    Teachers, students, and staff of Tianjin University are actively using all possible conditions to support agricultural technical transformation. Up to now, they have designed and manufactured a batch of agricultural tools and commune industrial machines suitable for people's communes.
    The Department of Inorganic Chemical Engineering is building a nitrogen fertilizer plant with an annual output of 800 tons of ammonia in Wangdingdi, a suburb of Tianjin, providing a small-scale nitrogen fertilizer plant and technical information suitable for rural people's communes. The characteristic of this plant is that it can be built quickly and saves materials, making it possible for all people's communes to universally establish small-scale nitrogen fertilizer plants quickly, well, and economically according to this design standard and construction experience.
    Tianjin University has also trained a group of technical workers for rural people's communes. In training technical workers, based on the principle of ensuring teaching, learning, quality, and quantity, attention was paid not only to shortening the training time but also to ensuring that the technology reached a certain level, so that they could operate independently after returning to the commune. Among them, more than 50 mechanics, milling workers, and fitters were trained for Anguo County alone.

    贵州以食堂为阵地建立业余学校
    贵州省以食堂为阵地，建立了政治、文化、技术三结合的业余学校，使农村青壮年入学人数达到四百二十七万多人，占农村青壮年总数的95％，在春耕大忙中坚持学习人数达78.75％以上。
    贵州省通过整顿食堂，把食堂、会堂、课堂“三堂合一”，成为对群众进行政治、技术、文化教育的场所。目前，全省有许多食堂已经成为生产队开会讨论生产，进行学习和文化娱乐活动的中心。使食堂成了一个温暖的大家庭。
    现在，贵州各地正在深入地研究、总结和推广食堂办学的经验，以便进一步推动农民业余教育的发展。
    湖南开展除害灭病突击战
    湖南省大张旗鼓，开展大搞卫生、大除四害、大灭疾病的突击战。目前，全省已有一千多万人投入运动。仅四天时间，全省就捕鼠二百零五万多只，灭蛹三万多斤。
    在大除四害、大搞卫生的同时，全省二十一万医疗人员、二万二千八百一十五个医疗队深入了生产第一线，开展预防治疗和卫生宣传工作。由于各地加强了灭病工作，最近全省的发病率比去年同期下降94％，出现了二十个基本无传染病县，大批公社社员出工率达99％以上。吉安专区干部搬到穷队穷社办公
    江西吉安专区各级党政领导机关工作作风大改变。到目前为止，全区已有三千多名机关工作人员，走出机关下到农村，搬到了穷社穷队或重点社、队办公。全区二百六十多个人民公社也都做到了办事开会在田间，屁股坐穷队，脚踏低产田。从地委、县委书记、委员到每个干部都配备了三件宝：斗笠、蓑衣、锄头。
    由于工作作风大改变，有力地推动了当前春耕生产。
    天津大学支援农业技术改造
    天津大学师生员工积极利用一切可能条件，支援农业技术改造。到目前为止，已设计和制造了一批人民公社适用的农具和公社工业用的机器。
    无机化工系正在天津郊区王顶堤兴建一座年产八百吨氨的氮肥厂，提供了一种适合农村人民公社需要的小型氮肥厂和生产技术资料。这种工厂的特点是建厂快，省材料，使各个人民公社都有可能按照这个设计标准和建厂经验多快好省地普遍建立小型氮肥厂。
    天津大学还为农村人民公社培训了一批技术工人。在培训技术工人中，本着包教包学，保质保量的原则，既注意了培训时间要短，又保证了技术达到一定水平，回公社后能独立操作，其中仅给安国县培训的车工、铣工、钳工等就有五十多人。
