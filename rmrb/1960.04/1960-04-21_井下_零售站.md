Material management work is directly related to saving pit props. To this end, everyone is trying to find ways. The comrades of the Materials Section and administrators of the Wangjiayuan Mine of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau conducted a thorough cleaning of all the pit props underground, sorted them according to their lengths and specifications, and nailed wooden signs to them. Afterwards, the pit props transported from the surface were also sorted and stacked according to specifications.

From then on, when the material haulers came to haul materials, they only needed to specify the specifications, and the material administrator could tell them where to haul them from. There was no need to rummage around, and there would be no more instances of hauling unsuitable materials. The material haulers were very satisfied and happily said, "This is really good, it saves time, it saves pit props, and every piece of material hauled is suitable." The workers call this underground material depot a "retail station" because it has a complete range of "goods" and convenient supply.

This material depot not only met the needs of production in a timely manner, but also saved a lot of pit props. According to statistics, this mine used forty-two cubic meters less of pit props in just ten days.

    井下“零售站”
    材料管理工作对节约坑木有直接关系。为了这，大家都在想方设法。萍乡矿务局王家源矿材料科长、管理员等同志，将井下的坑木全部进行了一次清理，按坑木的长短分规格堆放好，钉上木牌。以后，地面运进来的坑木，也按照规格分开堆放。
    从此以后，拖料工来拖料，只要说明规格，材料管理员就可以告诉他到什么地方去拖，再不用去东翻西翻，也不会发生拖去的料不合用的现象了。拖料工十分满意，高兴地说：“这样真好，又节约时间，又节约坑木，拖去的料根根合用。”工人们都叫这个井下料库为“零售站”。因为它“货物”齐全，供应方便。
    这个料库既及时满足了生产需要，又节约了许多坑木。据统计，这个矿仅在十天内，就少用了四十二立方坑木。
