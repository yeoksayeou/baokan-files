Promote the Poor Stick Spirit, Rely on Our Own Efforts, Dare to Think and Act
County and Commune Industries See Emergence of Technical Revolution Pioneers

    This newspaper reports that a nationwide technical innovation and technical revolution movement is expanding from cities to counties, towns, and rural areas. A number of technical innovation pioneers have already emerged in county and commune industries.

      County and Commune Industry Workers Eagerly Demand Technical Innovation
    Currently, there are 60,000 county-run industrial units and more than 200,000 people's commune industrial units across the country. The level of mechanization is very low, and workers have a particularly urgent demand for technical revolution. Under the strengthened leadership of local Party committees, many county and commune industry workers have fully promoted the "Poor Stick Spirit" and actively engaged in innovation. Due to a lack of necessary equipment and materials, many units have relied on their own efforts, utilizing local materials and adopting indigenous methods to "get started." They use ceramic pipes instead of steel pipes, and wood and stone instead of steel. In Hebei Province, twelve workers at the Pingshan County Fertilizer Factory walked an average of four thousand li each to find the minerals needed for production, and they finally succeeded. The workers at the Yuanshi County Coking Plant in Hebei Province were farmers a year ago, and the most skilled among them could only repair bicycles. Recently, after 409 experiments, they finally built a synthetic ammonia and ammonium sulfate workshop. Chen Yuzhen, the director of the Sanyin Antibiotic Factory in Dayi County, Sichuan Province, only had a junior primary school education. She didn't understand "balance" and wrote it as "weighing," and she couldn't remember "staphylococcus aureus," so she drew strings of circles resembling grapes. However, because of her great enthusiasm, she and the workers jointly produced many chemical industrial products.

    County and Commune Industries Can Also Achieve High-Speed Mechanization
    Many county and commune industries have used the method of launching mass movements to basically end the history of manual operation in a short period of time and achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization at high speed. In Guizhou Province, 36 out of 38 factories in Zhengan County achieved indigenous mechanization, semi-mechanization, and mechanization within two months. In Shanxi's Yicheng County, the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization in county-level industrial units increased from 31% to 92% after twenty days of hard work. In Heilongjiang Province's Zhaodong County, within two months, 354 manual operations in over 800 factories achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization, with the emergence of ten simple automatic production lines, thirty-nine automated single machines, and a semi-automated factory. In Jiaxing Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, over 30,000 innovation proposals were implemented, and the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization increased by 25% compared to the end of last year. 790 machine tools achieved semi-automation and automation, and 363 production linkage lines and 89 automatic production lines emerged. The technical revolution in county and commune industries is closely integrated with agricultural technical transformation.

    During the agricultural tool reform movement in the first few months of this year, many provinces and cities manufactured and promoted a large number of improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized agricultural tools, and county and commune factories became research sites for the rural technical revolution. Workers and farmers combined with each other, centered on county and commune factories, and comprehensively reformed and innovated agricultural tools, promoting spring plowing and also arming themselves. The machinery factory in Qianxi County, Guizhou Province, originally could only manufacture simple agricultural tools. After vigorously carrying out a technical revolution centered on improving agricultural tools, it is now able to produce more than 100 large agricultural machines and industrial equipment. The machinery factory in Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, originally could not repair tractors, but now it has mastered tractor overhaul technology and manufactured 13 kinds of tractor parts within a month. When Yongqiang Commune in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, needed a water turbine during the large-scale water conservancy campaign, it sent people to other places to purchase one, but they could not find one. After five days of experimentation, the commune's machinery factory finally manufactured a propeller-type water turbine using indigenous methods.

    Comprehensive Utilization of Agricultural and Sideline Products, Vigorously Innovating Transportation Tools
    The comprehensive utilization of agricultural by-products is also an important aspect of technical innovation in county and commune industries. In the first few months of this year, county and commune industries in Henan Province have used straw and wild plants to produce more than 900 million jin of crude starch, and within a month, they squeezed 1.68 million jin of oil from sesame straw and made 28 million jin of oil cake. County and commune industries in Liuan Prefecture, Anhui Province, widely use wheat straw, bran, etc. to brew wine, and the entire area has basically achieved wine brewing without grain. Ten small chemical factories in Dayi County, Sichuan Province, have used agricultural and sideline products to produce more than 20 kinds of products such as veterinary oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, caustic soda, and sulfuric acid.

    County and commune industries have also made significant achievements in innovating transportation tools. Within half a month, Liyang Iron Factory in Heshun County, Shanxi Province, achieved flatbed transportation at the pit mouth, cableway transportation in high mountains, rail transportation on flat ground, traction for blast furnace charging, and indigenous mechanization of loading and unloading. The number of transportation personnel was reduced from 450 to 32, and the cost of each ton of pig iron was reduced from 255 yuan to 165 yuan. Xinhua Iron Factory in Wengan County, Guizhou Province, vigorously carried out an in-plant transportation innovation movement based on wooden rails, reducing transportation personnel by 80%, reducing pig iron costs by 39%, and the original 280 horse-drawn carts were all reduced to support agriculture. Xinhua Iron Factory in Lushan County, Henan Province, installed automated hoppers and chutes, realizing "unmanned loading" and transferring all of the original 200 loading workers to other production.

    Currently, all regions are further strengthening the leadership of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in county and commune industries, so as to enable county and commune industries to better carry out this movement and unleash greater potential.

    发扬穷棒子精神　自力更生　敢想敢干
    县社工业涌现技术革命先锋
    本报讯　全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动正在由城市向县镇和农村扩展，县社工业中已经出现了一批技术革新的先锋。
      县社工业职工迫切要求革新技术
    目前全国共有六万个县营工业单位和二十多万个人民公社工业单位，机械化程度都很低，职工对技术革命要求特别迫切。很多县社工业职工在当地党委加强领导下，充分发扬了“穷棒子精神”，大闹革新。由于缺乏必要的设备和材料，许多单位就自力更生，就地取材，用土办法先“上马”；用陶瓷管代替钢管，用木头、石头代钢材。河北省平山县化肥厂十二个工人为了找到生产上所需要的矿石，平均每人步行四千里，终于找到了。河北省元氏县焦化厂的工人，一年以前还是农民，技术最高的只能修自行车，最近他们经过四百零九次试验，终于建成了一座合成氨硫酸氨车间。四川省大邑县三八抗菌素厂厂长陈宇贞，只有初小文化水平，“天平”不懂，记成“称”，记不住“葡萄状球菌”，就画一串串类似葡萄的圆圈。但是，由于她干劲足，终于同工人一起，制成了许多化学工业产品。
    县社工业同样可以高速度实现机械化
    很多县社工业用大搞群众运动的办法，在短期内基本结束手工操作的历史，高速度地实现了机械化和半机械化。贵州省正安县共有三十八个工厂，两个月内就有三十六个实现了土机械化、半机械化和机械化。山西翼城县的县级工业单位，经过二十天的苦战，机械化半机械化水平就从31％提高到92％。黑龙江省肇东县的八百多个工厂在两个月内，就有三百五十四项手工操作实现了机械化和半机械化，出现了十条简单的生产自动线，三十九台自动化单机和一个半自动化工厂。浙江省嘉兴专区实现了三万多项革新建议，机械化半机械化程度比去年年底提高了25％，七百九十台机床实现了半自动化和自动化，出现了三百六十三条生产联动线和八十九条自动生产线。县社工业技术革命同农业技术改造密切结合
    在今年头几个月的农具改革运动中，许多省市制造和推广了大批改良农具和半机械化农具，而县社工厂就成了农村技术革命的研究场所。工人和农民以县社工厂为中心，互相结合，对农具进行了全面改革和成套革新，推动春耕生产，也武装了自己。贵州省黔西县的机械厂，原来只能制造简单的农具，大搞以改良农具为中心的技术革命以后，已经能够生产一百多件大型农业机具和工业设备。陕西省蒲城县的机械厂原来不会修理拖拉机，现在已经掌握了拖拉机的大修技术，一个月内，自制了十三种拖拉机零件。浙江省温州市永强公社在大办水利运动中需要一台水轮机，派人到外地去采购，都没有买到；公社的机械厂经过五天试验，终于用土办法制成了一台旋桨式水轮机。
    综合利用农副产品　大力革新运输工具
    对农业副产品的综合利用也是县社工业技术革新的一个重要方面。河南省的县社工业今年头几个月内已经用秸草、野生植物制出九亿多斤粗淀粉，一个月内用芝麻秸榨出一百六十八万斤油脂，制成二千八百万斤油饼。安徽省六安专区的县社工业广泛利用麦秸、糠皮等酿酒，全区基本上实现了酿酒不用粮。四川省大邑县十个小型化工厂，利用农副产品，制成了畜用土霉素、金霉素、烧碱、硫酸等二十多种产品。
    县社工业在革新运输工具方面的成绩也很显著。山西省和顺县李阳铁厂在半个月内，实现了坑口运输平车化、高山运输索道化、平地运输轨道化、高炉下料牵引化、装车卸车土机械化，运输人员从四百五十人减少到三十二人，每吨生铁成本由二百五十五元降低到一百六十五元。贵州省瓮安县新华铁厂，大搞以木轨道为主的厂内运输革新运动，使运输人员减少了80％，生铁成本降低了39％，原有的二百八十部马车，全部减下来支援农业。河南省鲁山县新华铁厂安装自动化的漏斗和溜槽，实现了“无人装车”，使原有的二百个装车工人全部转入其他生产。
    目前，各地正在进一步加强对县社工业技术革新和技术革命运动的领导，以便使县社工业更好地开展这一运动，发挥更大的潜力。
