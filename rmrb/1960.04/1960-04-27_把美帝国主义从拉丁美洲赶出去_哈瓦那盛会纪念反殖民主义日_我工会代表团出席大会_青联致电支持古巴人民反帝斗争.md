Xinhua News Agency, Havana, April 25th: A grand gathering of over two thousand people from all walks of life in the Cuban capital was held last night at the Workers' Confederation Theater to commemorate World Youth Anti-Colonialism Day. The conference expressed the Cuban people's firm support for the people of Latin America, Asia, and Africa in their common struggle against American imperialism.

This commemorative gathering was organized by the Cuban Workers' Confederation, the "26th of July Movement," the Cuban Socialist Youth League, the Revolutionary Directorate, the University Student Federation, and the Rebel Army Youth Federation.

Above the rostrum, eye-catching slogans were posted and hung: Down with colonialism! Oppose American imperialist aggression! Advance the revolution! Swear to defend the motherland!

Jesus Soto, Organizational Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, said in his speech that the Bandung spirit lives in the hearts of the people of all countries who are determined to bury the imperialist oppressors forever. He expressed support for the black people of South Africa who are fighting for their rights, the Korean people who have been killed by American puppets, and the desire of the Puerto Rican people for independence and the release of Puerto Rican patriot Albizu Campos.

Captain Fernando Ravelo, Vice Chairman of the Rebel Army Youth Federation, said that the Bandung Conference marked a decisive step in the struggle against British, French and American colonialism in Asia and Africa. Now, the people of Latin American countries "must shout to these imperialist powers: Give Latin America independence and freedom!". He emphasized that the people of Latin American countries must unite with the people of Asia and Africa in order to finally drive out foreign oppressors.

The poet Nicolas Guillen said that just as the people of Asia and Africa have gained independence, American imperialism will also have to lower its flag before the people of Latin American countries. He said that the Cuban revolution proves that this day is not far away. He finally spoke of Chairman Mao Zedong's words about imperialists and reactionaries being paper tigers, amidst applause from the attendees. Guillen recited poems condemning the American colonial rule in Puerto Rico and American racial discrimination, winning standing ovations from the attendees.

Piero Pieralli, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, received thunderous applause for his speech. Pieralli expressed the support of youth around the world for the Cuban revolution in any situation. He said that the slogan of swearing to defend the motherland has become the voice of youth all over the world. He also announced at the meeting that Prime Minister Castro had agreed to the decision of the World Federation of Democratic Youth to send hundreds of young people from all over the world to Cuba to build the "Camilo Cienfuegos" school city in the Sierra Maestra Mountains with the Rebel Army.

Angel Quevedo, Secretary-General of the University Student Federation, announced that Cuban students will propose a continental student convention to students in Latin America. According to this convention, when the people of any country are invaded by colonialist forces, they will receive the support of students from other countries on the continent.

Ramon Calcines, Chairman of the Socialist Youth League, called for strengthening unity in the struggle against the world's youth's main and vicious enemy—American imperialism.

Also speaking at the meeting were Major Alberto Mora, leader of the Revolutionary Directorate, and Captain Emilio Aragones, National Coordinator of the "26th of July Movement." Alberto emphasized that if American imperialism ever launches an attack, the Cuban people will defend national independence to the last drop of blood. Captain Aragones expressed support for the people of Algeria and British Guiana who are fighting for independence.

At the end of the meeting, it was announced that Latin American exiles and expatriates had decided to organize a Latin American militia to defend the Cuban revolution, a decision that was greeted with cheers from the participants.

The representatives of the Chinese trade union delegation, who were invited to attend the conference, were warmly welcomed by all the delegates. When the conference read out a telegram from the All-China Youth Federation representing 130 million Chinese youth expressing their firm support for the Cuban people's struggle against American imperialism, a storm of applause erupted, and everyone shouted: China, China, China.

The conference also received congratulatory telegrams from former Prime Minister Jagan of British Guiana and the Romanian Labor Youth League.

    新华社哈瓦那25日电　古巴首都各界人士两千余人昨晚在工人联合会剧院举行了纪念世界青年反殖民主义日的盛大集会，大会表示古巴人民坚决支持在反对美帝国主义共同斗争中的拉丁美洲、亚洲和非洲各国人民。
    这次纪念大会是由古巴工人联合会、“7月26日运动”、古巴社会主义青年联盟、革命指导委员会、大学生联合会和起义军青年联合会组织的。
    大会主席台上面张贴和悬挂着这样一些醒目的标语：打倒殖民主义！反对美帝国主义侵略！推进革命！誓死保卫祖国！
    古巴工人联合会组织书记赫苏斯·索托在会上讲话时说，万隆精神活在决心把帝国主义压迫者永远埋葬掉的各国人民的心里。他表示支援正在为他们的权利而斗争的南非黑人，支援受美国的傀儡杀害的朝鲜人民和波多黎各人民要求独立和释放波多黎各爱国者阿耳维苏·坎波斯的愿望。
    起义军青年联合会副主席费尔南多·拉维洛上尉说，万隆会议标志着在亚洲和非洲的反对美英法殖民主义的斗争中的决定性的一步，现在我们拉丁美洲各国的人民“要向这些帝国主义大国高呼：给予拉丁美洲独立和自由！”。他强调指出，拉丁美洲各国人民必须和亚非各国人民团结起来，以便最后把外国压迫者驱逐出去。
    诗人尼古拉斯·纪廉表示说，正如亚洲和非洲各国人民已经取得独立一样，美帝国主义也将不得不在拉丁美洲各国人民面前降下自己的旗帜。他说，古巴革命证明，这个日子不远了。他最后在到会者的掌声中说起了毛泽东主席关于帝国主义者和反动派都是纸老虎的话。纪廉朗诵了谴责美国在波多黎各的殖民统治和美国的种族歧视的诗篇，博得了到会者的起立欢呼。
    世界民主青年联盟主席彼罗·皮埃拉利的讲话受到雷鸣般的掌声。皮埃拉利表示了全世界青年在任何情况下对古巴革命的支援。他说，誓死保卫祖国的口号已经成为全世界青年的呼声了。他在会上还宣布说，卡斯特罗总理已经同意了世界民主青年联盟关于从全世界各地派几百名青年到古巴，与起义军一起在马埃斯特腊山区建设“卡米洛·西恩富戈斯”学校城的决定。
    大学生联合会总书记安赫耳·克维多少校宣布说，古巴学生将向拉丁美洲的学生提出大陆学生的公约，根据这个公约，任何一国人民受到殖民主义力量的入侵时，将得到大陆其他各国学生的支持。
    社会主义青年联盟主席拉蒙·卡尔西内斯号召在反对世界青年最主要和凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义的斗争中加强团结。
    在会上讲话的还有革命指导委员会领导人阿耳贝托·莫拉少校和“7月26日运动”全国联络员埃米略·阿兰戈内斯上尉。阿耳贝托强调指出，假如美帝国主义一旦发动进攻，古巴人民将保卫民族的独立直到流尽最后一滴血。阿兰戈内斯上尉表示了对正在为争取独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚和英属圭亚那人民的支持。
    大会结束时，宣布了拉丁美洲的流亡者和侨民已经决定组织一支保卫古巴革命的拉丁美洲民兵，这一决定受到大会参加者的欢呼致敬。
    应邀参加大会的中国工会代表团的代表受到大会全体代表的热烈欢迎。当大会宣读了中华全国青年联合会代表一亿三千万中国青年表示坚决支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义的斗争的电报时，全场响起暴风雨般的掌声，大家高呼：中国，中国，中国。
    大会还收到英属圭亚那前总理贾根和罗马尼亚劳动青年联盟的贺电。
