    Sichuan Farmers Praise the Canteen as an "Iron Rice Bowl"
    More Than 97 Percent of Farm Households Participate in the Canteen
    (Our Newspaper News) All 620,000-plus rural public canteens in Sichuan Province have persisted, are becoming increasingly consolidated, and are getting better and better. The number of farm households participating in public canteens throughout the province accounts for 97.7% of the total number of farm households. The broad masses of farmers regard public canteens as their "lifeline" and "iron rice bowl." People sing praises, saying: "The canteen skillfully cooks meals for thousands of families, the commune warms the hearts of ten thousand people, thousands of years of anxiety have ended, and the Party's kindness is deeper than the sea."
    The 620,000-plus public canteens throughout the province have played a huge role in consolidating the people's commune system, promoting production, and improving the lives of commune members. Public canteens have liberated more than 10 million women laborers throughout the province, allowing them to participate in production with peace of mind; because commune members eat in the canteens, they work in full force, and labor efficiency has generally increased by 30% to 50%. Last year, some areas suffered from drought unprecedented in decades, but with public canteens as a backing, commune members did not worry about food and drink, ensuring victory over the drought and winning a bumper harvest. Although it is currently the time between the old and new harvests, because the canteens are well-planned and well-arranged, the canteens throughout the province serve hot meals with vegetables every day, and the existing rations can be connected to the marketing of the new grain. As a result, the broad masses of commune members are in high spirits and full of energy, and the spring production campaign is in full swing.
    After more than a year, general canteens have established a family production base. Public canteens in various places are also mostly "three halls in one" (canteen, classroom, meeting hall). Evaluation platforms, hero lists, reading rooms, etc. are set up in the canteen, becoming the center of political, economic, and cultural activities for production team members.
    Before the spring plowing, a comprehensive inspection of rural public canteens in various places showed that 94.5% of the canteens throughout the province have achieved or basically achieved "four goods": good pig raising and vegetable planting; eating enough and eating well, saving and hygiene; sound systems, accounts published monthly; implementing democratic management, commune members are satisfied. For the very few canteens that are not well-run, various places are immediately rectifying them and changing their appearance within a time limit.
    Party committees at all levels in Sichuan attach great importance to the leadership of canteen work. Life and welfare offices have been established at all levels from the province to the commune, with a secretary in charge. Every time production is deployed and inspected, the lives of the masses are also deployed and inspected. All cadres from all communes, management areas and those working in rural areas eat in public canteens. Party committees at all levels have established a large number of "canteen command fields." Wusheng County specifically dispatched cadres to help the small number of third-category canteens. The county party committee also selected the "March 8th" canteen of Longnv Commune, which was previously poorly run, as a pilot project to provide specific assistance, and then used the experience of running this canteen well to comprehensively guide the improvement of third-category canteens.
    At present, among the cooks and administrators of rural canteens throughout Sichuan Province, poor and lower-middle peasants have an absolute advantage. Facts have proven that if poor and lower-middle peasants control the leadership of the canteen, they can overcome any difficulties, actively unite commune members, and be diligent and thrifty.
    The experience of running rural canteens in Sichuan Province for more than a year has proven that in order to run public canteens well, it is necessary to implement the method of specialized management and use of grain and "quantitative distribution of rations based on the number of people, eating in the canteen, and saving for oneself." Nanbu County had a bumper harvest in 1958, but because of a lack of experience at the time, this was not done, and as a result, the state still had to supply a large amount of grain in the first half of 1959. This county learned from past experiences and lessons. After the autumn harvest last year, all communes generally established grain management systems based on management areas, accepting yields, concentrating storage, unified distribution, and regular payments. All canteens adhere to the principle of calculating before eating and being frugal during bumper harvests. As a result, by the end of last year, the communes throughout the county had a grain reserve of more than 44 million jin, which was enough to last until the next harvest this year. While implementing planned grain consumption, various places have also vigorously grasped vegetable production and pig, chicken, and duck raising. In addition to retaining an average of about five li of vegetable land per person for each canteen and establishing professional teams for collective management, commune members were also mobilized to make full use of the vacant land around fields and houses to increase the planting of melons, beans, and other crops. Last year, various places seized the opportunity to increase the planting of a large number of autumn and winter vegetables, and around the Spring Festival this year, they successively launched a nationwide campaign to rush to plant spring vegetables and plant "pumpkin kings." By mid-February, various places had planted more than 3.56 million mu of early-maturing spring vegetables such as Chinese cabbage and cowpea, and more than 5.35 billion nests of pumpkins. Although it is currently the off-season for vegetables, general canteens can eat two to three jin of vegetables per person per day, and the minimum is one jin. This not only saves grain, but also diversifies the variety of dishes. Canteens in various places plant a large number of vegetables and raise pigs, not only to meet the needs of commune members, but also to transfer them out to support the urban people. The money from the sale of vegetables in many canteens is enough to add canteen utensils and oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and other items.
    Sichuan also pays special attention to relying on the masses to run canteens well. General canteens have established canteen management committees, formulated democratic management systems and covenants, and regularly hold canteen representative meetings to listen to the opinions of the masses and improve canteen work.
    Vigorously reforming cooking tools is another important link in consolidating and improving the canteen. Yibin, Wanxian, Nanchong, Leshan and other special regions have launched a cooking tool reform campaign: changing manual grinding to animal-powered grinding; changing manual water carrying to indigenous tap water; changing single stoves to continuous stoves; changing manual vegetable cutting to machine cutting, the working efficiency and food quality have been significantly improved.

### 四川农民称赞食堂是“铁饭碗”  参加食堂的占总农户百分之九十七以上

    四川农民称赞食堂是“铁饭碗”
    参加食堂的占总农户百分之九十七以上
    本报讯　四川省六十二万多个农村公共食堂全部坚持下来，日趋巩固，越办越好。全省参加公共食堂的农户占总农户97.7％。广大农民把公共食堂当成“命根子”、“铁饭碗”，人们歌颂说：“食堂巧煮千家饭，公社温暖万人心，千年焦愁从此断，党的恩情比海深。”
    全省六十二万多个公共食堂对巩固人民公社制度，促进生产和改善社员生活起
  了巨大作用。公共食堂解放全省妇女劳动力一千多万人，使她们安心参加生产；社员由于在食堂吃饭，出工整齐，劳动工效普遍提高30％到50％；去年有的地方遭到数十年未有的干旱，但是有公共食堂作后盾，社员不愁吃喝，保证战胜干旱，夺得了丰收。当前虽是青黄不接的时节，由于食堂计划性强，安排得好，全省各食堂每天饭热菜香，现有口粮都能接上新粮上市。广大社员因此情绪高、干劲足，春季生产运动搞得热火朝天。
    经过一年多的时间，一般食堂都建立起家底生产。各地公共食堂又大都是“三堂合一”（食堂、课堂、会堂），在食堂内设立有评比台、英雄榜、阅览室等，成为生产小队社员政治、经济、文化活动的中心。
    春耕前，各地对农村公共食堂进行全面检查的结果，全省94.5％的食堂都做到或基本做到“四好”：养猪种菜好；吃饱吃好节约卫生；制度健全，账目月月公布；实行民主管理，社员满意。对极少数办得不好的食堂，各地都立即加以整顿，限期改变面貌。
    四川各级党委十分重视对食堂工作的领导。由省到社层层设立了生活福利办公室，由一个书记专管，每次布置和检查生产，都要布置和检查群众生活。所有公社、管理区和到农村工作的干部一律在公共食堂吃饭。各级党委建立了大量“食堂指挥田”。武胜县对少数三类食堂，专门派干部具体帮助，县委还选择了原先办得较差的龙女公社“三八”食堂为试点，具体加以帮助，然后用办好这个食堂的经验，全面指导改进三类食堂。
    目前，四川全省农村食堂的炊事员和管理员中，贫农和下中农已占绝对优势。事实证明，贫苦农民掌握了食堂的领导权，就能够克服任何困难，积极团结社员，做到勤俭节约。
    四川省一年多来办农村食堂的经验证明，要办好公共食堂，必须实行粮食专管、专用和“以人定量，分配口粮，食堂吃饭，节余归己”的办法。南部县1958年获得大丰收，但是由于当时缺乏经验，没有这样做，结果1959年上半年还要国家供应大批粮食。这个县吸取了以往的经验教训，去年秋收后，各公社以管理区为单位普遍建立粮食管理制度，验收产量，集中保管，统一分配，定期支付。各食堂坚持先算后吃、丰收俭用的原则，结果到去年年底，全县各公社库存粮食有四千四百多万斤，吃到今年小春接下来还有余。各地在实行计划用粮同时，大抓蔬菜生产和养猪、养鸡鸭等。各食堂除了每人平均留有五厘左右的蔬菜地，建立专业组集体经营外，还发动社员充分利用田边地角屋前屋后等空隙土地大量增种瓜豆等作物。去年各地抓紧时机增种了大量秋菜和冬菜，今年春节前后又连续开展了全民性的抢种春菜和种植“南瓜王”运动。到2月中旬，各地已种植了瓢儿白、牛皮菜等早熟春菜三百五十六万多亩，南瓜五十三亿五千多万窝。现在虽是蔬菜淡季，但是一般食堂每人每天能吃到二至三斤蔬菜，最少的也能吃到一斤。这样既节约了粮食，又使菜饭多样化。各地食堂大量种菜养猪，不仅满足社员食用，还外调支援城市人民。许多食堂出售蔬菜的钱，足够添置食堂用具和油、盐、酱、醋等物品。
    四川各地还特别注意依靠群众办好食堂。一般食堂都建立了食堂管理委员会，订了民主管理制度和公约，定期召开食堂代表会议，听取群众意见，改进食堂工作。
    大力改革炊事工具，是巩固、提高食堂的又一重要环节。宜宾、万县、南充、乐山等专区食堂都掀起了炊事工具改革运动：改人力推磨为畜力拉磨；改人挑水为土自来水；改单锅灶为连锅灶；改人力切菜为机器切菜，工作效率和饭菜质量都有显著提高。
