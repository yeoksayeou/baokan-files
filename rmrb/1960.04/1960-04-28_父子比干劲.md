Editor's Note: In recent years, Shanghai has dispatched a large number of workers to Ningxia to support economic construction there. With the start of the continued Great Leap Forward this year, another group of retired veteran workers have voluntarily applied to go to Ningxia, determined to pass on their years of accumulated skills to workers of all ethnic groups in Ningxia. These articles, reprinted from the Ningxia Daily, were written by the veteran workers themselves. Their enthusiasm is evident in their words, and their grand ambitions to build a new Ningxia inspire us greatly.

Father and Son Compete in Enthusiasm

I had only been in Yinchuan for three days when I wrote to my son, Liangen. The veteran workers who came to Ningxia with me asked, "Master Qin, are you homesick!" I smiled and said, "I'm not homesick at all. I want to tell Liangen about the joy in my heart, so he'll work even harder in production and become a production expert!"

Before coming to Ningxia, Liangen said to me, "Dad, when you go to Ningxia, you must teach your cold work skills to the workers there, without being conservative!" Look, he was giving me ideological education. I said, "Liangen, you are an electrical worker at the Dazhonghua Shipyard, and I am a retired cold work worker at the Hudong Shipyard. We can never let the shipyard workers down. Now that I have another opportunity to contribute to socialism, how can I hold back!"

Before liberation, I was a temporary worker without a fixed job, and the money I earned in a day wasn't enough to feed my family. After liberation, I became a shipyard worker with a monthly salary of over one hundred yuan. Life is getting better and better. As I got older, the factory leaders cared about my health and let me retire to enjoy a happy old age. But I have only worked for socialism for a few years! I am really happy to have the opportunity to come to Ningxia to participate in construction. In this letter, I told Liangen, "Ningxia is a good place. It is developing very fast, and many mines and iron factories are being built. No matter which factory I go to, I will patiently train new workers and teach them everything I know, so that they can better build a new Ningxia." I also said in the letter, "Liangen, let's have a long-distance competition! You must strive to become a production expert and a technical innovation expert, and I will be a top-notch old Huang Zhong!"

    编者按　几年来，上海市曾抽调大批工人到宁夏去，支援那里的经济建设。今年继续跃进开始，又有一批退休的老工人，自动申请到宁夏去，立志把他们多年积累下来的精湛的技艺，传授给宁夏各族职工。我们从宁夏日报转载的这几篇文章，是老工人们自己写的。他们的热情洋溢在字里行间，他们以建设新宁夏为己任的宏图大志，给我们很大的鼓舞。
    父子比干劲
    我到银川刚刚三天，就给儿子连根写了信。和我同来宁夏建设的老年工人都问我：“秦师傅，想家啦！”我笑着说：“我才不想家呢，我是想把心里的乐劲告诉连根，叫他在生产上更卖些劲，好当个生产能手！”
    来宁夏前，连根跟我说：“爸爸，你到宁夏，得把你的冷作技术通通教给那里的工人，不能保守呀！”你看看，他倒给我作思想工作了。我说：“连根，你是大中华造船厂的电气工，我呢，是沪东造船厂退休的冷作工，什么时候也不能给造船工人丢脸。现在我又有机会为社会主义出力了，我还能留着劲不使出来吗！”
    解放前我是个没有固定职业的临时工，一天挣的钱还不够一家老小吃饱肚子。解放后，当了造船厂工人，一个月工资一百多元，日子真是越过越红火了。年岁大了，厂子领导关心我身体，让我退休，过老年幸福生活。可是我才为社会主义工作了几年啊！这次有机会到宁夏来参加建设，我真高兴。我在这封信里告诉连根：“宁夏是个好地方。这里发展很快，许许多多的矿山、铁厂都建设起来了。我不管到哪个工厂，一定耐心地培养新工人，把自己知道的东西都教给他们，让他们更好地建设新宁夏。”我在信里还说：“连根咱们俩来个远距离竞赛吧！你要努力当个生产能手、技术革新能手，我要当个呱呱叫的老黄忠！”              　沪东造船厂冷作工　秦金生
