Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 19th: Panmunjom News: At today's meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, Major General Zhu Changjun, the chief representative of the Korean and Chinese side, strongly protested the American side's serious violation of the armistice agreement by bringing "Honest John" missiles into South Korea and preparing to launch them, and demanded that the United States immediately cancel its plan to launch these missiles.

Today's meeting was held at the suggestion of the Korean and Chinese side. Prior to this, the Korean and Chinese side had lodged forty-four protests and warnings to the US side regarding its violation of the armistice agreement by illegally bringing in atomic weapons and missiles. However, the US side, disregarding the repeated protests and warnings from the Korean and Chinese side, recently brought "Honest John" missiles into South Korea and publicly announced that it would launch these missiles on April 19th at the base of the 20th Artillery Regiment of the US First Cavalry Division in South Korea.

Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out at the meeting that the US side's carrying out of such conspiracies at present "is on the one hand to further expand its military equipment and prepare for nuclear war in South Korea, so as to tear up the ceasefire terms at any time when the US side deems it necessary and re-ignite a bloody war; on the other hand, it is also to continue to use military threats to suppress the recent increasingly high anti-American and anti-Syngman Rhee sentiment of the South Korean people."

Major General Zhu Changjun demanded at the meeting that the United States withdraw all newly-style weapons illegally brought into South Korea, and, in accordance with the provisions of the armistice agreement, severely punish all US personnel who illegally brought in and prepared to launch the "Honest John" missiles.

However, the US side's chief representative, Maddux, not only stubbornly rejected the demands of the Korean and Chinese side, but also arrogantly declared that the US military occupying South Korea should "maintain strength." This fully exposed the US side's deliberate conspiracy to continue to violate the Korean Armistice Agreement and intensify its arms expansion and war preparations in South Korea.

Major General Zhu Changjun severely condemned the US side's unreasonable attitude, and warned the US side: "If your side, disregarding our strong protests and warnings, insists on taking such a serious and heinous action, then your side must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom."

    美国公然要在南朝鲜发射导弹
    朝中方面提出强硬抗议
    朱昌骏少将揭露美国企图借此威胁南朝鲜人民的斗争
    据新华社平壤19日电　板门店消息：朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将今天在朝鲜军事停战委员会会议上强烈抗议美方把“诚实的约翰”导弹运入南朝鲜并准备发射的严重违反停战协定的行为，并且要求美国立即取消发射这种导弹的计划。
    今天的会议是在朝中方面建议下举行的。在这以前，朝中方面就美方非法运入原子武器和导弹的违反停战协定的行为，向美方提出过四十四次抗议和警告。但是，美方不顾朝中方面的屡次抗议和警告，最近又把“诚实的约翰”导弹运入南朝鲜并且公然宣布：4月19日要在南朝鲜的美国第一骑兵师第二十炮兵团基地发射这种导弹。
    朱昌骏少将在会议上指出，美方在目前进行这种阴谋活动“一方面是为了进一步在南朝鲜扩充军备和准备核战争，以便在美方认为必要时随时撕毁停火条款，再次挑起流血战争；另一方面也是为了继续以武力威胁抑制南朝鲜人民最近日益高涨的反美反李气势。”
    朱昌骏少将在会议上要求美国把一切非法运入的新式武器撤出南朝鲜，并且按照停战协定规定，严惩非法运入和准备发射“诚实的约翰”导弹的所有美方人员。
    但是，美方首席委员马达克斯不仅蛮横地拒绝了朝中方面的要求，而且还狂妄地宣称强占南朝鲜的美军要“保持强大”。这充分暴露了美方蓄意继续违反朝鲜停战协定和在南朝鲜加紧扩军备战的阴谋。
    朱昌骏少将严厉谴责了美方这种无理态度，并且警告美方说：“如果你方不顾我方的强硬抗议和警告，硬要采取那种严重的罪恶行动，那么你方就必须对由此而产生的一切后果负全部责任。”
