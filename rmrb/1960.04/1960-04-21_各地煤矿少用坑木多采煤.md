Xinhua News Agency, 19th – Through technical innovation and the technical revolution movement, coal mine workers across China have created a variety of new methods that use no or less pit props, initiating a change from the situation of "exchanging wood mountains for coal mountains" that has existed since the beginning of coal mining. This is a revolutionary initiative in the history of the coal industry. It plays a significant role in ensuring the sustained Great Leap Forward in coal industry production and construction. To date, more than 200 coal mining faces across the country are using substitutes instead of pit props for support, and more than 20 mines have basically eliminated the use of pit props. In February and March alone, the national average consumption of pit props per thousand tons of raw coal produced decreased by more than 20% compared to 1959, saving the country a total of 170,000 cubic meters of wood in two months.

Pit props are a major material for coal mine production and construction. According to the national average quota for pit prop consumption in coal mines in 1959, every thousand tons of coal production required 22.4 cubic meters of pit props. Due to the rapid development of the coal industry, the demand for pit props has increased sharply, while the growth process of wood is very long. Therefore, the insufficient supply of pit props has become a major key issue in coal industry production and construction. To resolve this contradiction, coal mining enterprises across the country, at the beginning of this year, took saving pit props as the main direction of the technical revolution. They boldly reformed mining methods and found various substitutes, greatly reducing the consumption rate of pit props. For example, Kailuan and Chongqing coal mines successfully tested "three-without" (no people, no pit props, no electric chute) working faces by reforming mining methods. Workers only need to stand in the roadway to drill and blast or operate the coal cutting machine, without having to enter the working face to mine and load coal, thus eliminating the need for pit props as supports. Now, this "three-without" working face has not only been widely promoted in the steeply inclined thick coal seams of 16 coal mines, including Jingxi and Huainan, but has also been creatively and successfully tested in the gently inclined thin coal seams of the Zibo coal mine.

Coal mines such as Hegang, Datong, and Hegang have created the use of shield supports in medium-thick coal seams, changing the original layered mining method to a one-time extraction, thereby saving a large amount of pit props.

Coal mining enterprises in various regions, based on the principles of adapting to local conditions and using local materials, have widely used flagstone, furnace ash slag, limestone, bamboo, thorns, etc., to successfully trial-produce various new types of supports, further opening up new avenues for saving pit props, reducing coal mining costs, and improving labor productivity. For example, the furnace ash slag supports commonly used in Pingxiang and Jiaozuo coal mines cost only one-third of the price of pit props, and are easy to manufacture, so most coal mines can produce them themselves. The 60-type support jointly created by the Beijing Coal Science Research Institute and the Jingxi Coal Mine workers is now also widely used in mines across the country; this new type of support can be reused more than 100 times, its cost is three-quarters lower than that of pit prop supports, and its structure is simple and the supports are easy to be retracted, which is very popular among the vast number of coal mine workers.

In addition to this, various mines have also widely promoted concrete supports, flagstone masonry, and the twenty support retraction methods summarized at the National Coal Mine Pace-setter Selection Conference, which had been created in the past. These support retraction methods can increase the pit prop recovery rate from about 60% to more than 98%, and the reuse rate reaches 80%.

The Ministry of Coal Industry attaches great importance to the new experiences in saving pit props that have emerged in various regions. Since March, the ministry has successively held on-site meetings and telephone conferences to summarize and exchange experiences in saving pit props, and has formulated a plan for comprehensive promotion.

### 各地煤矿少用坑木多采煤

    各地煤矿少用坑木多采煤
    二百多工作面支柱全用代用品　十几个煤矿出现“三无”工作面
    全国坑木消耗率比去年降低二成　“木山换煤山”的局面开始转变
    新华社19日讯　我国煤矿职工在技术革新和技术革命运动中创造了多种多样不用或少用坑木的新方法，使自有煤矿以来就是“木山换煤山”的局面开始发生了变化。这是煤炭工业史上具有革命意义的创举。它对保证煤炭工业生产和建设的持续大跃进起着重大的作用。到目前为止，全国已有二百多个采煤工作面不用坑木而用代用品作支柱，并且有二十多个矿井做到基本上不用坑木。仅2、3月份内，全国平均每产一千吨原煤消耗的坑木，就比1959年降低了20％以上，两个月内共为国家节约了十七万立方米的木材。
    坑木是煤矿生产建设的主要材料。按照1959年全国煤矿的坑木消耗平均定额计算，每产一千吨煤就需要坑木二十二点四立方米。由于煤炭工业的飞跃发展，坑木的需要量急剧增长，而木材的生长过程又很长，因此，坑木供应不足就成为煤炭工业生产建设中的一个主要关键。为了解决这一矛盾，各地煤矿企业在今年一开始，就以节约坑木作为技术革命的主攻方向。他们大胆地改革采煤方法，寻找多种代用品，使坑木消耗率大大降低。例如开滦、重庆两煤矿，由于改革采煤方法而试验成功了“三无”（无人、无坑木、无电溜子）工作面。工人只要站在巷道内从事打眼放炮或操纵割煤机，不必进入工作面去采煤和装煤，因而也就不需要坑木作支柱。现在，这种“三无”工作面不仅已在京西、淮南等十六个煤矿的急倾斜厚煤层中普遍推广，而且在淄博煤矿的缓倾斜薄煤层中也创造性地试验成功了。
    鹤壁、鹤岗、大同等煤矿创造了在中厚煤中使用掩护支架，把原来分层开采的方法改为一次采出，从而节省了大量坑木。
    各地煤矿企业根据因地制宜、就地取材的原则，广泛利用片石、炉灰碴、石灰石、竹子、荆棘等，试制成功各种新型的支柱，更为节约坑木、降低采煤成本和提高劳动生产率开辟了新途径。例如萍乡和焦作两煤矿普遍采用的炉灰渣支柱，造价只及坑木的三分之一，而且制造容易，一般煤矿都能自己生产。北京煤炭科学研究院和京西煤矿的职工共同创造的六○型支柱，现在也已经在全国各矿广泛采用；这种新型的支柱复用次数可以达一百次以上，成本比坑木支柱低四分之三，而且结构简单，回柱方便，深受广大煤矿职工欢迎。
    除此以外，各矿还普遍推广了过去就已创造的混凝土支柱、片石砌?，以及不久前在全国煤矿标兵选拔大会上总结出来的二十种回柱方法。这些回柱方法，可以使坑木回收率从原来的60％左右提高到98％以上，复用率达80％。
    煤炭工业部十分重视各地出现的节约坑木的新经验。自3月以来，这个部已经连续召开了现场会议、电话会议，总结和交流了节约坑木经验，并且制定了全面推广的计划。（附图片）
