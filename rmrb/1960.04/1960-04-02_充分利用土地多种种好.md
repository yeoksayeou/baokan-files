    **Make Full Use of Land, Plant Well and Multiply**

    **Hubei Expands Spring Planting Area**
    Hubei's people's communes are making every effort to save land and expand the spring planting area.
    Zaoyang County has expanded the spring planting area by more than 100,000 mu by adopting methods such as leveling slopes and filling ditches, adjusting unreasonable channel lines, and combining small plots into large plots. Many communes in the Enshi area have also widely adopted the practice of growing vegetables and pig feed on the mountains, ensuring the expansion of the area for grain and cotton crops. Residents of large and small cities throughout the province have also been planting vegetables or minor grains in the suburbs and in some idle land within the city that has never been cultivated before.

    **Changde Utilizes Land Reclaimed from Capital Construction**
    In the winter of last year and the spring of this year, Changde County, Hunan Province, dug up and covered more than 16,000 mu of farmland during capital construction projects for water conservancy and transportation. Recently, in accordance with the instructions of the county party committee, the communes have assigned this land to production teams and work groups for management. The land reclaimed by the production teams is also included in the production plan, and a production responsibility system is established, with rewards for overproduction. After more than ten days of effort, the dug-up and covered land has been transformed into paddy fields or dry land, and some have already been planted with spring buckwheat and early corn.

    **Boli County Intercrops Tall and Short Stature Crops**
    Boli County, Heilongjiang Province, is vigorously promoting the experience of intercropping and close planting tall and short crops such as corn and soybeans to increase yield per unit area.
    In 1959, Boli County tested intercropping corn and soybeans on more than 600 mu of land, and the yield increase was very significant. Therefore, this year, in addition to intercropping with soybeans, the county plans to intercrop corn with potatoes and other crops.

    **Fenyi Vigorously Builds Sweet Potato Mountains, Pumpkin Mountains, and Corn Mountains**
    Fenyi County, Jiangxi Province, has mobilized the entire population to vigorously build sweet potato mountains, pumpkin mountains, and corn mountains on barren hills and ridges, turning more than a thousand barren mountains and ridges in the county into granaries, and striving to increase grain production by more than 70 million catties this year. By mid-March, the county had already established 305 sweet potato mountains, 761 pumpkin mountains, and 110 corn mountains, and the area of spring-sown miscellaneous grains had been expanded by more than 70,000 mu.

    **Liaozhong County Rushes to Plant Upland Crops Before Rice**
    Liaozhong County, Liaoning Province, is mobilizing more than 18,000 people and 3,000-4,000 plows every day to rush to plant upland crops before rice.
    Planting a crop before rice in paddy fields is a good method for increasing production that has been successfully tested in the local area for several years. For example, Wang Guodong, a rice technician from Ciyutuo Commune, tested two crops of wheat and rice on 2.7 mu of land, yielding 736 catties per mu, an increase of 80% compared to growing a single crop. This year, the county has decided to implement two crops on paddy fields. Planting began universally on March 25th.

    充分利用土地多种种好
    湖北扩大春播面积
    湖北各地人民公社千方百计节约用地，扩大春播面积。
    枣阳县采用平坡填沟、调整不合理的渠道线路、小块并大块等办法，已扩大春播面积有十多万亩。恩施地区许多公社还广泛采取蔬菜和猪饲料上山，保证了粮棉作物面积的扩大。全省大小城市的居民近来也都在近郊和市内一些历来没有耕种过的闲地上种了蔬菜或小杂粮。

    常德利用基本建设废地
    湖南常德县在去冬今春水利、交通等基本建设中挖、压了一万六千多亩田地，最近，各公社按照县委的指示分别把这些土地划给生产队、作业组经营。生产队所整理的挖压地，同样纳入生产计划，并且建立生产责任制，实行超产奖励。经过最近十多天的努力，这些被挖压的田地都已改成了水田或旱地，部分已经种上了春荞麦和早玉米。

    勃利县高低秆作物间种
    黑龙江省勃利县在大力推行玉米和大豆高矮棵作物间作密植的增产经验，以提高单位面积产量。
    1959年勃利县在六百多亩面积上试行了玉米、大豆间作，增产效果都很显著。因此，今年全县的玉米除和大豆间作外，还计划与土豆等作物实行间作。
    分宜大建红薯山南瓜山玉米山
    江西分宜县发动全民在荒山荒岭上大建红薯山、南瓜山、玉米山，使全县千余座荒芜的山岭变成粮仓，争取今年增产七千多万斤粮食。全县到3月中旬已经建立的红薯山有三百零五个，南瓜山七百六十一个，玉米山一百一十个，春播杂粮面积扩大七万多亩。
    辽中县抢种水稻上茬作物
    辽宁省辽中县每天出动一万八千多人、三四千副犁杖，突击抢种水稻上茬农作物。
    在水稻田增种一季作物，是当地几年来经过试验获得成功的一项增产的好办法。例如茨于坨公社水稻技术员王国栋试种的二亩七分地的麦稻两季作，每亩产麦稻七百三十六斤，比种单季作物增产80％。今年全县确定稻田实行两季作。3月25日普遍开始播种。
