Advanced Regions Strive for Dual Well and Canal Insurance Backward Regions Try Every Means to Find Water Sources
Hebei's Drought Resistance Promotes Water Conservancy Construction
Mengjin County, Henan Province, Builds a Complete Water Conservancy System in Hilly Areas
    This newspaper, Tianjin, 7th -- Hebei Province's people's more than two months of drought resistance struggle has achieved significant results. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the province have extensively opened up water sources, greatly constructed water conservancy, and worked together with one heart and one mind to fight the drought. This has not only effectively curbed the development of the drought, but also further improved the level of water conservancy construction.
    Since last winter and this spring, there has been little rain and snow in Hebei Province. The province's area of wheat fields and spring fallow land with moisture loss or deficiency has reached more than 60 million mu, accounting for 52% of the province's existing cultivated land. Although there has been some rainfall in various places recently, the drought situation is still quite serious. As early as February, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a battle call to the broad masses of commune members throughout the province: "The whole party and the entire people must be urgently mobilized to resolutely eliminate the spring drought." The broad masses of cadres and people throughout the province, with the lofty aspirations and soaring enthusiasm of "ensuring sowing without spring rain, and ensuring a bumper harvest without annual rain," launched a struggle against the drought. Party committees at all levels have established specialized organizational structures. More than 45,000 secretaries and members of party organizations at all levels and more than 120,000 general cadres, together with more than 10 million commune members, used all water sources and all water lifting tools, and adopted the "five fixes" method of fixed location, fixed person, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed quantity to launch a fierce attack on the drought. The daily irrigated area of the province has increased from about one million mu in early March to the current one million two hundred and thirty thousand mu. While irrigating, they harrowed the land to conserve moisture. As of now, more than 44 million mu of land with moisture deficiency or loss in the province has been irrigated. Among them, 22 million mu of wheat fields have achieved dual drought and flood insurance or can be irrigated with seasonal water, and many spring fallow lands basically have the moisture content to ensure sowing.
    To break through the dead ends of water conservancy construction, improve the level of basic farmland water conservancy construction, make the advanced even more advanced, the backward catch up with the advanced, and make the province's water conservancy construction take a further leap, is a prominent feature of Hebei Province's drought resistance struggle this year. When the signs of drought appeared, party committees at all levels organized water conservancy moisture inspection teams and put forward different requirements for different regions. For some high-yield areas with better water conservancy, it is required to achieve dual insurance of canals and wells, so that there are wells and tools, the canals are clear and the ground is level, drainage and irrigation are free, and water is available whenever it is needed, to ensure that crops are not affected by drought. In order to achieve dual insurance of wells and canals, according to incomplete statistics, the province has newly drilled 731 motorized wells, built 596 new pumping stations, repaired 163,000 new and old canals, and built 52,000 new sluice gates and other buildings in this year's drought resistance struggle. For areas with poor water conservancy construction, in the spirit of "drought resistance as the main task, small scale and diversification, use first, then improve, and quick benefits," water conservancy construction is being stepped up. Shexian County, located in the deep mountains with difficult water conservancy conditions, dispatched an army of 100,000 people to fight the drought, built 22 bridges across ditches, and opened 146 new canals, crossing 22 mountain ditches and 79 ridges, to lead water to the mountain slopes, turning 170,000 mu of hill and slope land in the county into paddy fields. Commune members said: "Gaining the initiative in drought resistance, making the Dragon King angry and seizing a bumper harvest."

    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 7th -- In the drought resistance and wheat protection campaign, Mengjin County, Henan Province, has, after more than two months of hard work, completed the drilling of more than 400 motorized wells. The county now takes motorized wells and motorized irrigation stations as the core, and connects the original medium and small reservoirs, pits, mountain springs, and small water wells into a complete water conservancy system for storage, pumping, diversion, and irrigation through canals, creating experience for water conservancy construction in mountainous and hilly areas.

    87% of Mengjin County's land is on the Mangshan Ridge, 600 to 800 meters above sea level, with droughts in nine out of ten years. The general public believes that wells cannot produce water in high mountains. In the drought resistance last winter and this spring, the Mengjin County Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the experience of water conservancy work in recent years, analyzed the natural characteristics of Mangshan, and believed that the key to fundamentally solving the water conservancy problem of Mangshan lies in exploring groundwater. Wei Nairu, the first secretary of the county party committee, personally directed the pilot project in the Hanliang Brigade of the Hengshui Commune. After fifty days of hard work and overcoming many difficulties, they succeeded in drilling a large motorized well with a wellhead diameter of two zhang three and a well depth of five zhang, with a deep spring at the bottom of the well. It used a diesel engine to drive two motorized water trucks, which could pump 120 cubic meters of water per hour. It did not dry up after four days and four nights of continuous pumping, thus breaking the superstition that there were no underground springs on Mangshan Ridge.

    The county party committee summarized the experience in a timely manner. It found that the law of drilling wells on Mangshan Ridge is: because the local groundwater is not strong, and most of it is "seepage water," it is suitable to drill large wells. The wellbore should be larger than ordinary wells, and the well should go down to the deep spring to increase the water receiving area. The county party committee held an on-the-spot meeting, proposing the slogan "Drill through Mangshan Ridge, extract all groundwater springs, motorized wells go to Mangshan, and bumper harvests do not rely on heaven." The first secretaries of party committees at all levels throughout the county took the lead, established motorized well headquarters, organized hundreds of professional teams, and launched a mass motorized well drilling campaign. The Haizi Commune, where there are few underground water sources, also horizontally dug three caves under the well to increase the water receiving area. In places where there are more small water wells, people have also dug crisscrossing underground canals to connect the small wells in series to form an underground water network, which greatly improved the irrigation capacity.

    With the development of the motorized well drilling campaign, the county party committee further proposed "a dragon of wells, springs, reservoirs, ponds, and canals," taking motorized wells and motorized irrigation stations as the core, and connecting various water conservancy projects through canals. The Hengshui Commune adopted the method of diverting water to the mountains, winding around the mountains, digging holes when encountering mountains, building bridges when encountering ditches, machine pumping water, and lifting it step by step, connecting all the medium and small reservoirs, pits, mountain springs, pumping stations, and newly drilled motorized wells in the commune. In times of drought, it can be fully utilized to irrigate the land; in times of flood, reservoirs, ponds, and cellars can store a large amount of water. In this way, the wells and reservoirs support each other, and more than 80,000 mu of land in the commune are irrigated.

    河北抗旱促进水利建设
    河南孟津县在丘陵山区建成完整水利系统
    本报天津7日电　河北全省人民两个多月的抗旱斗争，已取得重大成就。全省人民在党的领导下，广开水源，大修水利，一条心、一股劲地和干旱作战，不仅有效地制止了旱情的发展，并进一步提高了水利建设的水平。
    河北省去冬今春以来雨雪很少，全省失墒、欠墒的麦田和春白地曾达到六千多万亩，占全省现有耕地面积的52％。虽然近来各地略有降雨，但旱情仍然相当严重。中共河北省委早在2月间，就向全省广大社员群众发出了“全党全民紧急动员起来，坚决消灭春旱”的战斗号召。全省广大干部群众，以
  “春不下雨保播种，年不下雨保丰收”的雄心壮志和冲天干劲，向干旱展开斗争。各级党委都建立了专门组织机构，全省有四万五千多名各级党组织的书记、委员挂帅，十二万多名一般干部同一千多万名社员群众一起，利用所有水源和全部提水工具，采用定地、定人、定时、定质、定量的“五定”办法，向干旱展开了猛攻。全省日浇地由3月初的百万亩左右，提高到现在的一百二十三万多亩。一面灌溉，一面耙地保墒。截至目前，在全省欠墒、失墒的土地中，已有四千四百多万亩进行了灌溉。其中麦田有二千二百万亩达到旱涝双保险或能浇季节水，许多春白地都基本具备了保种的墒情。
    千方百计地突破水利建设的死角，提高农田水利基本建设水平，使先进的更先进，落后赶先进，使全省水利建设跃进一步，是河北省今年抗旱斗争中的一个突出特点。当旱象一露苗头的时候，各级党委就组织了水利墒情检查组，对不同地区提出了不同要求。对一些丰产方水利化较好的地区，要求达到渠井双保险，作到有井有具、渠通地平、排灌自如、何时用水何时有，保证庄稼不受旱。为着实现井渠双保险，据不完全统计，全省在今年抗旱斗争中已新打机井七百三十一眼，新建扬水站五百九十六处，修整新旧渠道十六万三千多条，新建闸门等建筑五万二千多座。对于水利建设较差的地区，则本着“抗旱为主，小型多样，先使用，再提高，受益快”的精神，加紧水利建设。地处深山水利条件困难的涉县，出动十万抗旱大军，隔沟架桥二十二道，新开渠道一百四十六条，跨过二十二道山沟，越过七十九个岭，把水引上山岗，使全县十七万亩岗坡地变成水田。社员们说：“抗旱夺得主动权，气死龙王夺丰产。”
    新华社郑州7日电　河南省孟津县在抗旱保麦运动中，经过两个多月的奋战，打成机井四百多眼。全县现在以机井和机灌站为核心，通过渠道将原有的中小水库、坑塘、山泉、小水井联结成一个蓄、抽、引、灌的完整水利系统，为山区和丘陵区的水利建设创造了经验。
    孟津县有87％的土地在邙山岭上，拔海六百至八百米，十年九旱。一般群众都认为高山打井不出水。在去冬今春抗旱中，中共孟津县委总结了几年来水利工作的经验，分析邙山的自然特点，认为要根本解决邙山的水利问题，关键在于挖掘地下水。县委第一书记卫乃如亲自指挥，在横水公社寒亮大队进行了试点。经过五十天的奋战，克服了许多困难，结果打成了一眼井口直径有两丈三，井深五丈，井底下深泉的大机井，用柴油机带动两部机动水车，每小时能抽水一百二十立方米，连抽四天四夜没抽干，从而打破了认为在邙山岭上没有地下泉的迷信。
    县委及时总结了经验。找出了在邙山岭上打井的规律是：由于当地的地下泉水不旺，多是“渗山水”，因而适合打大井，井筒要比一般井大，下深泉以增加来水面积。县委就地召开现场会议，提出“钻透邙山岭、提净地下水泉，机井上邙山，丰收不靠天”的口号。全县各级党委第一书记挂帅，成立机井指挥部，组织了几百个专业队，展开了群众性打机井运动。地下水源少的海资公社，在井下又横打三个窑洞增加来水面积。在小水井比较多的地方，人们还打了纵横交错的地下渠道，把小井串起来，形成地下水网，大大提高了灌溉能力。
    随着打机井运动的开展，县委又进一步提出“井、泉、库、塘、渠一条龙”，以机井和机灌站为核心，通过渠道使各种水利工程联结起来。横水公社，采取了引水上山、环山盘绕、逢山凿洞、遇沟架桥、机器抽水、节节提升的办法，把全社的中、小型水库、坑塘、山泉、抽水站和新打的机井沟通起来。旱时可充分利用起来浇地；涝时水库、塘、窖可以大量蓄水。这样，井、库互相支援，全社八万多亩地都得到灌溉。
