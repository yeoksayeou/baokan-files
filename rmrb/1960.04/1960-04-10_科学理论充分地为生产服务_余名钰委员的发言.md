After listening to Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report, I have a clearer understanding of the achievements of the Standing Committee's work over the past year and the direction of the CPPCC's future work. I fully agree with this report.

After listening to the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, I felt exhilarated and enlightened. Such a great plan for continued leap forward and such a national budget for peaceful construction can only appear in our socialist country, which makes me further realize the superiority and inevitable high-speed development of the socialist economy, and deeply appreciate the great significance of studying Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought combined with Chinese practice.

In the two years of the Great Leap Forward in our country, the innovations of technical innovation and technical revolution have blossomed everywhere. The achievements are so great that they are difficult to count. These many new achievements not only broke the old production records, but also broke many conventions and habitual practices. There are also many vivid examples in the steel industry, such as the high output of small iron smelting furnaces, the low coke consumption of cupolas melting pig iron, steelmaking without baking in converters, and the use of hot air in side-blown alkaline converters. These are all new achievements in our country's Great Leap Forward that have never been seen abroad, especially the high output of small blast furnaces.

It has been considered a rule that the larger the furnace, the higher the productivity; now the iron production per cubic meter of furnace volume in small blast furnaces is more than that of large blast furnaces every day; this is a miracle that breaks the conventional rules, a product of the technical revolution in the Great Leap Forward, and an unprecedented achievement of small blast furnaces in the two-legged approach. This is an achievement based on the masses, carrying forward the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and exploring from actual production; scientific theory has not fully played its due role in this technical revolution.

Scientific workers have long known from the data calculations in the laboratory that iron ore can achieve full reduction in the furnace in just one hour; however, they did not dare to suggest that such a short smelting cycle could be used in small blast furnaces to increase productivity, because the smelting cycle in large blast furnaces is more than four hours. Now, technical revolutionaries have shortened the smelting cycle to 70 or 80 minutes, close to the fastest iron ore reduction time.

Scientific workers also know very well that accelerating the flow rate of furnace gas is beneficial to heat exchange and iron ore reduction, so that productivity can be improved; but they are afraid that accelerating the flow rate of furnace gas will affect the smooth operation of the furnace charge or cause high heat at the top of the furnace. Now the air volume has been increased, the combustion intensity and smelting intensity have been greatly increased, and the furnace gas flow rate and velocity have been increased a lot, but the furnace charge still descends smoothly, and the temperature at the top of the furnace has not increased.

Scientific workers can calculate the heat required for each stage of preheating, reduction, melting, and superheating in the blast furnace, as well as the heat capacity of the generated furnace gas. From the calculated heat balance, it can be clearly seen that when the combustion intensity is too low and the generated heat is not enough to supply the needs of each stage, the smelting cycle is long, the coke consumption is high, and the productivity cannot be improved; increasing the air volume to increase the combustion intensity can change these shortcomings. Once calculated, starting from the heat balance, it is possible to control the furnace top temperature, find the necessary height of the furnace body, and the shortest smelting cycle. But we did not make such calculations in time to derive this technical revolution, so that it could be completed faster and more comprehensively. This is because our minds were not liberated, so that we could not fully exert the spirit of daring to think and daring to speak.

The problem of reducing coke consumption for melting iron in cupolas has been discussed in the foreign foundry industry for more than 30 years; although it has been generally recognized that it is possible to reduce it to below 4% of the weight of pig iron, there has been no record of below 6% in actual operation. The coke consumption of Shanghai Xintai Sand Casting Factory has been reduced to 5%, and it has been promoted to other factories in Shanghai, and several other factories have also reduced to the same low coke consumption. Scientific theory has not been fully utilized in this technical innovation.

Scientific workers have concluded from heat balance calculations that when the coke consumption is more than 6%, the heat of the furnace gas can meet the heat required for the preheating and superheating zones, but it cannot meet the needs of the melting zone, so the later stage of the melting zone is in the combustion zone. The deeper the melting zone enters the combustion zone, the more bottom coke is consumed, so the coke consumption is higher. When the coke consumption is less than 6%, the heat of the furnace gas can not only not meet the melting zone, but also can hardly meet the preheating and superheating zones; if no measures are taken, it will cause the iron blocks to descend raw and cause the furnace to cool. Therefore, some people believe that 6% is the lowest lower limit of coke consumption, which is why some people believe that the maximum ratio of coke to iron can only reach 16.6.

Technical innovators introduce the waste gas with a temperature of 1,500 degrees Celsius discharged from the front grate into the melting zone to increase the furnace gas flow in the melting zone and the preheating zone, and bring in more heat. This moves the preheating zone upwards, so that the starting melting point of the iron blocks also moves upwards. Therefore, the melting zone will not enter the combustion zone very deeply, and the coke consumption will drop significantly. We could have calculated approximate data in advance to promote this innovation movement, and we can recalculate based on the data after the innovation to derive further innovation, but no one dared to think and dared to do.

Steelmaking without baking the furnace is an unconventional operating method; although it also loses some heat, the amount is not large, and omitting the furnace baking time to make steel greatly increases production, so it is still a method worth adopting.

The origin of this method is from the operation of furnace slag washing the furnace. Steelmaking without baking the furnace does not lose a lot of heat. At that time, it was not obtained through prior accounting, but from the steel tapping temperature of actual smelting, so scientific theory was not fully utilized in advance.

The use of hot air in side-blown alkaline converters is based on heat balance and carried out for productive testing. The heat brought in by the hot air is certain to increase the furnace temperature. The steel produced by high-temperature refining has less gas and inclusions, which plays a great role in improving the quality of the steel. However, in the process of converter blowing, the higher the furnace temperature, the stronger the reducing property in the carbon flame period; the stronger the reduction, the less the iron oxide content in the slag, and the lower the phosphorus distribution, which is not conducive to removing high phosphorus; to wait for the later stage to remove phosphorus will lose the significance of hot air steelmaking to improve quality. We also did not fully apply scientific theory in advance, and did not conduct a detailed analysis to make the experiment more specific and comprehensive.

In general, we must use scientific theory to promote practice in production, and then obtain data from practice to enrich theory. After these are combined with each other, not only will technical innovation develop faster, but also the scientific level will rise very high. We must study better so that scientific theory can fully serve production and play a guiding and promoting role in technical innovation.

    科学理论充分地为生产服务
    余名钰委员的发言
    听了陈叔通副主席的报告，使我更清楚地认识到常务委员会一年来工作中的成绩和政协今后工作的方向。我完全同意这个报告。
    听了李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告，使我感到欢欣鼓舞，并得到启发。这样继续跃进的伟大计划和这种和平建设的国家预算，只能在我们建设社会主义的国家里才会出现，使我进一步认识到社会主义经济的优越性和高速发展的必然性，更加体会到学习马克思主义与中国实践相结合的毛泽东思想的重大意义。
    在我国两年来的大跃进中，技术革新和技术革命的创举，遍地开花，其成就之大，难以总计；这许多新成就不独突破了旧的生产记录，也打破了许多陈规惯律。在钢铁工业中也有不少生动的事例，如炼铁小高炉的高产量、冲天炉熔化生铁的低焦耗、转炉不烘炼钢、侧吹碱性转炉使用热风等，都是国外所未曾有过而为我国大跃进中的新成就，其中尤以小高炉高产的事例最为突出。
    炉子越大，生产率越高，已经认为是规律；现在小高炉里每立方米炉腔容积在每日里产铁量比大高炉的多；这是一个打破常规的奇迹，是大跃进中技术革命的产物，也是两条腿走路里小高炉的空前成就。这是依靠群众，发扬敢想敢做的精神，从实际生产中摸索出来的成绩；科学理论在这个技术革命中没有充分地起到其应有的作用。
    科学工作者从实验室的数据推算中，早已知道铁矿在炉内逗留时间不过一小时，就能达到充分还原；但是不敢建议小高炉里可以采用这样短的冶炼周期来提高生产率，因为大高炉里冶炼周期在四小时之上。现在技术革命者已经把冶炼周期缩短到七八十分钟，接近最快的铁矿还原时间。
    科学工作者也熟知炉气流速的加快是有利于热交换和铁矿的还原，使生产率得以提高；但又恐加快炉气流速会影响炉料顺行或炉顶发生高热。现在增加了风量，燃烧强度和冶炼强度提得很高，炉气流量和流速加得很多，但是炉料下降还是顺利，炉顶温度没有升高。
    科学工作者能把高炉里预热、还原、熔化、过热各阶段所需热量和所发生炉气的热容量计算出来。从计算出来的热量平衡中能很清楚地看到燃烧强度太低，所发热量不足以供应各段的需要时，冶炼周期长，焦炭消耗多，生产率提不高；增加风量以提高燃烧强度，就能改变这些缺点。一经计算之后，从热量平衡出发，就能控制炉顶温度，求得炉身的必要高度，以及最短的冶炼周期。但我们没有及时地作出这样计算来推导这个技术革命，使其完成得更快更全面，这是思想不解放以致不能充分发挥敢想敢说的精神。
    降低冲天炉里熔化铁水的焦耗问题，在国外铸工工业中已经讨论了三十多年；虽经公认有可能降低到生铁重量的4％以下的，但在实际操作中，还没有出现6％以下的记录。上海新泰翻砂厂的焦耗已经降低到5％，而且推广到上海的其它各厂，也有好几个厂降一样低的焦耗。科学理论对这个技术革新也没有得到充分利用。
    科学工作者从热量平衡计算中已经得出，焦耗在6％以上的，炉气热量能满足予热和过热带所需热量，不过不能满足熔化带的需要，所以熔化带的后期是在燃烧带里。熔化带进入燃烧带越深，消耗底焦越多，因此焦耗越高。焦耗在6％以下的，炉气热量非但不能满足熔化带，同时也难以满足予热和过热带；如果不加措施，会使铁块生降，造成炉冷，因此就有人认为6％是焦耗的最低下限，这就是有人认为焦铁最大比率只能达到十六点六的说法之所由来。
    技术革新者把前炉排出的摄氏一千五百度温度的废气引入熔化带以增加熔化带和予热带里的炉气流量，并带入更多热量，这样把予热带向上移动，使铁块的开始熔化点跟着向上移动，于是熔化带不会进入燃烧带很深，焦耗就显著地下降。我们能够在事前计算出近似的数据来推动这种革新运动，在事后可以根据革新后的数据，加以再计算以推导再革新，但是没有人敢想敢做。
    不烘炉炼钢是打破常规的操作方法；虽然也要损失些热量，但数量不大，而省去烘炉时间来炼钢则增产很多，所以还是一个值得采用的方法。
    这种方法的起源是从炉渣洗炉的操作发展起来的。不烘炉炼钢不会损失很多热量，当时不是先经过核算而是从实际冶炼的出钢温度中得出的，所以科学理论在事前也没有得到充分利用。
    侧吹碱性转炉使用热风是根据热平衡而进行生产性试验的。热风带入热量，对提高炉温是肯定的。高温精炼所产的钢里气体和夹杂较少，对提高钢的质量起到很大作用的。不过在转炉吹炼的过程中，炉温越高，碳焰期中的还原性越强；还原越强，炉渣里氧化铁含量越少，磷的分布越低，对去除高磷是不利的；要待后期去磷，就会失去热风炼钢以提高质量的意义。我们也没有很好地在事前充分应用科学理论，加以详细分析，使试验做得更具体而全面。
    总的讲来，我们一定要使科学理论来推动生产中的实践，再从实践中得到资料来充实理论。这样相互结合之后，不独使技术革新会发展得更快，科学水平也就会跟着升得很高。我们要更好地学习，做到科学理论能够充分地为生产服务，在技术革新中起到向导和推动的作用。
