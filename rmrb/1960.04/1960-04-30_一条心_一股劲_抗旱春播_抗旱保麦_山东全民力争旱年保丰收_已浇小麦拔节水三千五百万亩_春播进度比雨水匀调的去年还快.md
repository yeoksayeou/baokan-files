    Jinan, April 29th (by our newspaper) The entire party and people of Shandong Province are of one heart and one mind, working with one spirit, launching a massive campaign to fight drought and rush planting and to fight drought and protect wheat. Fifteen million peasants are full of energy and high morale, determined to make good use of surface water, tap underground water, bring all water tools into action, and bring all water to the fields, fighting drought until the heavens bow their heads and not letting a drop of rain fall to ensure a bumper harvest. All sectors of the province are also doing their best to support the fight against drought.
    Since last autumn, the province has experienced little snow and little rain this spring. The weather is warm and windy, and soil moisture evaporates quickly. In addition, the spring drought is developing on the basis of last year's severe drought, with insufficient soil moisture. Therefore, more than 80 million mu of spring fields and wheat fields in the province are suffering from varying degrees of drought.
    In order to achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest of crops in 1960, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee has consistently regarded drought-resistant spring planting and drought-resistant wheat protection as the central task overriding everything else since the beginning of spring. People's communes in various places, in the spirit of "getting an early start to seize the initiative," have organized forces to cultivate spring fields early, plow and rake finely to conserve moisture and prevent drought, and vigorously carry out tool reforms, rush to manufacture water lifting tools, and accelerate land preparation and canal construction, so that trickles of water converge into huge currents, irrigating wheat and ensuring spring field planting. The 44 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, more than 10,000 small reservoirs, more than 100,000 ponds and reservoirs, and more than 33,000 diversion river and interception undercurrent projects built in the province last winter and this spring have mostly played a role, increasing the ability to resist drought and irrigate land.
    In addition to making full use of existing wells and mountain springs, the people of Shandong have also vigorously developed and utilized underground water sources to persist in long-term drought resistance. Since the fight against drought began this spring, the province has newly drilled 2,600 mechanized wells, more than 60,000 water wells, more than 220,000 temporary wells, and excavated more than 17,000 mountain springs and intercepted undercurrents. Together with small diversion rivers, small reservoirs, ponds and other projects, the total irrigated area has been expanded by more than 6.5 million mu, and the irrigation area has been improved by 4.1 million mu.
    In order to eliminate dead corners in drought resistance, party organizations in mountainous areas have also put forward the slogan of advancing into the hills and mountains, thereby promoting the further development of water conservancy construction in these areas.
    The people of Shandong have achieved great victories in their struggle against the drought demon. After watering spring fields and watering wheat for reviving green, by the 26th of this month, more than 35 million mu of wheat had been watered for the jointing stage, accounting for 52.5% of all wheat fields. This wheat is growing luxuriantly and densely, and a bumper harvest is expected. More than 24 million mu of drought-resistant spring planting has been completed, accounting for 44.5% of the spring planting plan, and the progress is even faster than the same period last year when rainfall was more evenly distributed. The broad masses in some areas sang praises: The people's commune has the power to turn the tide, opening canals and diverting water to irrigate fields, digging out ten thousand feet of potential water, and ensuring a bumper harvest even without rain.

### 一条心　一股劲　抗旱春播　抗旱保麦  山东全民力争旱年保丰收  已浇小麦拔节水三千五百万亩　春播进度比雨水匀调的去年还快

    一条心　一股劲　抗旱春播　抗旱保麦
    山东全民力争旱年保丰收
    已浇小麦拔节水三千五百万亩　春播进度比雨水匀调的去年还快
    本报济南29日电　山东省全党全民一条心，一股劲，抗旱抢种和抗旱保麦运动声势浩大。一千五百万农民精神焕发，斗志昂扬，决心用好地上水，挖出地下水，水具齐上阵，万水归到田，抗旱抗到天低头，滴雨不落保丰收。全省各行各业也都尽力支援抗旱斗争。
    这个省从去秋以来雪水稀少，今春又少雨，天暖风多，土壤水分蒸发快；加上春旱又是在去年大旱的基础上发展起来的，底墒不足，旱情严重，因此全省有八千多万亩春田和麦田遭受不同程度的干旱。
    为了夺取1960年农作物全面大丰收，山东各级党委从入春以来，一直把抗旱春播和抗旱保麦作为压倒一切的中心任务。各地人民公社本着“一早百早争主动”的精神，组织力量，一面早耕春田，多耙细耢，保墒防旱；一面大闹工具改革，赶制提水工具，加速整地修渠，使涓涓之水汇成巨流，灌溉小麦和保证春田播种。去冬今春全省建成的四十四项大中型水利工程，一万多座小型水库，十余万处塘坝蓄水池，三万三千多处引河截潜流等工程，大部分发挥了作用，增加了抗旱浇地的能力。
    山东人民坚持长期抗旱，除了充分利用原有机井、山泉以外，还大力开发利用了地下水源。自从今春抗旱以来，全省新打机井二千六百眼，水井六万多眼，临时井二十二万多眼，挖山泉、截潜流一万七千多处，连同小型引河、小水库、塘坝等工程，共扩大灌溉面积六百五十多万亩，改善灌溉面积四百一十万亩。
    为了消灭抗旱死角，山区党组织又提出了向丘陵山地进军的行动口号，从而推动了这些地区水利建设的进一步开展。
    山东人民奋战旱魔已取得很大胜利。全省在浇春田和浇小麦返青水之后，到本月26日，又浇小麦拔节水三千五百多万亩，占全部麦田的52.5％，这些小麦生长得葱绿密茂，丰收有望；抗旱春播二千四百多万亩，占春播计划的44.5％，进度比雨水匀调的去年同期还快。有的地区广大群众歌颂道：人民公社力回天，开渠引水来浇田，万丈潜水挖出来，无雨也能保丰产。（附图片）
