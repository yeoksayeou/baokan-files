Water Conservancy Promotes High-Speed Agricultural Development
Bao Haizhen, First Secretary of the CPC Qingyang County Committee

Qingyang County is traditionally known as the "Granary of Eastern Gansu," but before liberation, due to the criminal rule and cruel exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, grain production was extremely low, and the people's lives were arduous. A folk song circulating at the time went: "Borrowing to eat, paying back by working, debts never end year after year; hoping to get rich this year, wearing crotchless pants every year." After liberation, under the leadership of the superior Party committee, the Party organizations and the hardworking and brave three hundred thousand people of Qingyang County launched a struggle to control mountains and rivers and eliminate drought in the high tide of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Over the past ten years, especially after the establishment of people's communes, tremendous victories have been achieved. The county has built more than 200,000 mu of irrigated land. The Wangjiawan Reservoir, with a storage capacity of ten million cubic meters, was completed as early as 1957. Currently, the Bajiazui Reservoir, one of the largest water storage projects in the province, is under active construction. The Dongzhi People's Commune has transformed a dilapidated Xiaokongtong into a place where fish and ducks thrive in the ditches, terraced fields cover the slopes, and fruit trees flourish in the orchards. The reservoir water, lifted 200 meters from the bottom of the gully, irrigates the millennia-old arid land of Dongzhi Yuan, and also generates electricity, achieving comprehensive utilization. Even more exciting is the Nanxiaohegou, famous throughout the province, which has been cultivated into a fruit and flower mountain. The Yangjiagou has water all year round, with no soil erosion and greenery everywhere. All these miracles of mountain and water management inspire the confidence of thousands of people to march towards nature.

In the struggle to control mountains and rivers and eliminate drought, the heroic people of Qingyang have deeply realized that: preserving surface water, tapping groundwater, and drawing water from gullies are the directions for mountain and water management in Qingyang County. For example, Xiaokongtong and Nanxiaohegou, which have preserved surface water, suffered no damage to their planted wheat in the four consecutive frosts of minus eight degrees Celsius in 1959, with a yield of over 400 jin per mu. Huoxianggou lifted water eighty meters to the plain surface, not only generating electricity, but also irrigating a small area of farmland, achieving a yield of over 400 jin per mu even during the seventy to eighty days of drought. Wangjiawan, where dams were built in the gullies and water was stored, has changed the natural landscape within a ten-mile radius. This fully proves that the key to increasing grain production in Qingyang County, especially in Dongzhi Yuan, is to control the plains, mountains, and rivers. To educate cadres and the masses throughout the county, the county Party committee organized commune members and cadres from various communes to visit key areas such as Wangjiawan and Nanxiaohegou more than twenty times in July and August of 1959. It also convened several on-site meetings here for the Party secretaries of various communes, preparing for the large-scale mountain and water management efforts that began last winter and this spring. Therefore, after the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Eleventh Enlarged Meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, and the Twelfth Enlarged Meeting of the Prefectural Party Committee was conveyed, the Qingyang people's enthusiasm for fighting nature boiled over. In October 1959, a force of 50,000 laborers in Dongzhi Yuan, after seven days of hard work, built a flower and fruit wall encircling Dongzhi Yuan for more than 3,000 li. Following the successful completion of the flower and fruit wall, a vigorous movement to build highland reservoirs was launched. After a month of effort, the county built a total of 7,000 highland reservoirs and large and small ponds, with a storage capacity of 100 million cubic meters. This not only controls the runoff on the plain surface but also intercepts a large amount of floodwater, which can irrigate a large amount of highland land, truly achieving the purpose of promoting benefits and eliminating harm. The completion of the flower and fruit wall can prevent wind and frost, and the construction of highland reservoirs can prevent floods and droughts. The Party's slogan of "eliminating drought in winter" is a great encouragement and spur to us. However, how to eliminate drought in winter is a new topic and a serious test for the people and cadres throughout the county. What to do? Only by following the mass line. To this end, the Qingyang County Party Committee sent cadres to various places to conduct investigations, convened meetings of veteran peasants for research, and held four-level cadre meetings for discussion. Through a series of work, a very important path was found, that is, in addition to controlling surface water, it is also necessary to tap a large amount of groundwater and intercept gully water. The county Party committee first summarized the experience of the people of Dongzhi Yuan in using well-digging to solve the problem of drinking water for people and animals, and made a decision to dig 200,000 wells last winter and this spring. Then, by summarizing the experience of Huoxianggou in lifting water to the plain, it made a decision to lift water to the plain on a large scale. These two decisions met the urgent needs of the Qingyang people and received the full support of the broad masses of the people. After more than seventy days of hard work, 170,000 water wells have now been dug and 70 places to draw gully water to the plain have been established. More than a dozen communes north of Qingyang City have built more than 1,000 large and small canals. Including the original 200,000 mu of irrigated land, the county now has more than 700,000 mu of paddy fields and irrigated fields, and another 300,000 mu have already been put on engineering measures, and it is estimated that the task can be completed soon.

Due to the large-scale mass movement, the water conservancy cause in Qingyang County has given full play to the potential and wisdom of the masses, resulting in a flourishing and colorful situation in water conservancy projects. Summarizing it, there are the following points: First, gully water storage, lifting water to the plain. Second, digging wells in blocks, with each well having a tank (reservoir), storing water during normal times and irrigating when needed. Third, open canals and underground channels, leading water out of the plain. Fourth, multiple wells connected in series for centralized pumping. Fifth, plum blossom wells. Sixth, all canals release water throughout the year, with large ponds built beside the canals, arranged like stars in the sky, storing water in the farmland. At present, the high tide of water conservancy construction in Qingyang County is unprecedented in terms of scale and speed of progress. It is truly: red flags waving everywhere, good news constantly pouring in, crowds of people all over the mountains and fields, and miracles happening every moment. Today, from the boundless Dongzhi Yuan to the Yuelechuan, which stretches for 200 li, and even to the Ziwuling Mountains, which run through the junction of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, an area of over 11,000 square kilometers is filled with earth-shaking activity and deafening voices. We are fully confident that as long as we continue to maintain the revolutionary vigor of the broad masses of the people, we will surely achieve water conservancy in a short period of time.

The high-speed development of water conservancy construction in Qingyang County further proves the irrefutable truth that "to revolutionize nature, we must first revolutionize our thinking." In recent years, the development of water conservancy construction in Qingyang County has been achieved through repeated and fierce struggles against various forms of right-leaning conservative thinking. Looking back at the beginning of water conservancy construction, some people with serious right-leaning conservative thinking once used arguments such as "large mountains and deep gullies, poor foundation, and too few laborers, making it impossible to control mountains and rivers" to obstruct the cause of water conservancy construction. We used the method of focusing on pilot projects, gaining experience, and educating the entire Party and all the people. We first conducted key demonstrations in Wangjiawan and Nanxiaohegou. The facts inspired the broad masses of the people, powerfully criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, and greatly promoted the cause of water conservancy construction in Qingyang County. In 1958, Qingyang County built more than 200,000 mu of irrigated land and controlled soil erosion over 2,900 square kilometers. The achievements in one year exceeded those of the previous thousands of years before liberation, which further inspired the people of the county to a high tide of water conservancy construction.

Due to the great development of the water conservancy movement, tremendous changes have taken place in the county's industrial and agricultural production. After the construction of dams to store water in the gullies, large areas of river terraces appeared downstream, reaching more than 400,000 mu in the county. After the gully water was brought to the plains, the problem of drinking water for people and animals in the gullies in the past was solved. This alone can save nearly 500,000 laborers in the county. Xifeng and other communes also raised nearly one million fish in ponds. The Dongzhi People's Commune used water storage to generate electricity. Due to the star-studded water conservancy facilities, a large amount of organic fertilizer was produced, solving the problem of nitrogen fertilizer deficiency on the Dongzhi Yuan for thousands of years.

What is especially exciting is that the development of water conservancy has promoted the great development of animal husbandry. The six people's communes in Dongzhi Yuan now raise 60,000 pigs, including 10,000 sows. According to our preliminary investigation, during the spring plowing this year, each person can reach an average of more than one pig. All these facts give people another deep realization: if you only think that water is used to irrigate farmland, then you are underestimating this omnipotent thing. Water can not only develop agriculture, but also promote industry, and is an important foundation for a comprehensive revolution in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. The comprehensive development of industry and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, in turn, promotes the high-speed development of agricultural production. Therefore, realizing water conservancy is a key to achieving high-speed agricultural development. We are determined to continue to work to the end and strive to achieve water conservancy as soon as possible.

    水利化促进农业高速度发展
    中共庆阳县委第一书记　包海珍
    庆阳县素称“陇东粮仓”，但在解放前，由于国民党反动派的罪恶统治和残酷剥削，粮食产量极低，人民生活艰苦，当时在这里流传的一首歌谣是：“借着吃，打着还，年年债务还不完；今年盼着明年富，年年穿的没裆裤。”解放后，在上级党委的领导下，庆阳县的党组织和勤劳勇敢的三十多万人民，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设高潮中，开展了治山治水、消灭干旱的斗争。十年来，特别是人民公社化后，获得了巨大的胜利。全县共修水地二十多万亩，蓄水千万方的王家湾水库，早在1957年就已修成；目前全省最大的蓄水工程之一——巴家嘴水库正在积极兴建；董志人民公社将一个破烂不堪的小崆峒，治理成了沟底鱼鸭渠塘化，沟坡梯田果木园，将沟底扬程二百米的库水，提上了董志塬，滋润着这里千年干旱的土地，并发了电，进行了综合利用。更使人兴奋的是闻名全省的南小河沟，培植成了花果山；杨家沟长年有水，泥不下坡，有坡皆绿。这一切治山治水的奇迹，鼓舞着千千万万的人们向大自然进军的信心。
    英雄的庆阳人民，在治山治水、消灭干旱的斗争中，深刻体会到：保住原面水，挖掘地下水，提引沟壑水，是庆阳县治山治水的方向。如保住了塬面水的小崆峒和南小河沟，在1959年接连四次零下八度的霜冻中，所种的小麦未受一点灾害，亩产在四百斤以上。火巷沟提程八十米，将水抽上原面后，不仅发了电，而且浇了小面积的农田，在七、八十天的旱象中，亩产还在四百斤以上。沟壑打了坝、蓄了水的王家湾，改变了周围十里以内的自然面貌。这就充分证明了，要提高庆阳县、特别是董志塬的粮食产量，关键是治塬、治山、治水。为了教育全县干部和群众，县委早在1959年的7、8月份，就组织各公社的社员和干部，参观了王家湾、南小河沟等重点地区二十多次，又召集各公社党委书记在这里举行了多次现场会议，为去冬今春大规模的开展治山治水作了准备。因此，当党的八届八中全会、省委第十一次扩大会议和地委十二次扩大会议精神传达后，庆阳人民向自然斗争的情绪，沸腾了起来。1959年10月份，董志塬五万劳动大军，经过七天奋战，营造了三千多里围绕董志塬一周的花果围墙。继花果围墙胜利完成之后，又开展了一个轰轰烈烈的兴修高原水库运动。经过一个月的努力，全县共兴修高原水库和大小涝池七千座，容水量达一亿公方。不仅可以控制原面的径流，而且拦蓄了大量的洪水，可以灌溉大量的高原土地，确实达到了兴利除害的目的。花果围墙完成了可以防风防冻，高原水库修成了可以防洪防旱。党提出“把干旱消灭在冬季”的口号，这对我们是一个巨大的鼓舞和鞭策。但是，如何把干旱消灭在冬季，这对全县人民和干部是一个新的课题和严重考验。到底怎么办？只有走群众路线。为此，庆阳县委派出干部到各地进行调查，召开老农会议进行研究，举行四级干部会议进行讨论，通过一系列的工作，找到了一条非常重要的途径，这就是除了控制原面水，还要大量挖掘地下水和拦蓄沟底水。县委首先总结了董志塬人民利用打井解决人畜饮水的经验，作出了去冬今春打井二十万眼的决定，又通过总结火巷沟提水上原的经验，作出了大规模提水上原的决定。这两个决定是符合庆阳人民迫切要求的，而且得到了广大人民的全力支持。经过七十多天的大战，现在已挖水井十七万眼，引沟水上原七十处。庆阳城北的十多个公社，兴修了大小渠道一千多条，连原有的二十万亩水地在内，全县已有水田和水浇田七十多万亩，还有三十万亩已经摆上了工程措施，估计最近可以完成任务。
    庆阳县的水利事业，由于大搞群众运动，发挥了群众的潜力和智慧，从而在水利工程上出现了百花争艳、万紫千红的局面。概括起来，有如下几条：第一，沟壑蓄水，提水上原。第二，块块打井，井井有柜（蓄水池），平时蓄水，需时灌溉。第三，明渠暗道，引水出原。第四，多眼串井集中抽水。第五，梅花大井。第六，一切渠道长年放水，渠旁大修水池，作到星罗棋布，将水蓄在农田。目前庆阳县的水利建设高潮，声势之大，进展之快，空前未有。真是：红旗到处招展，捷报不断频传，人群漫山遍野，奇迹时刻出现。如今，从一望无际的董志塬到长达二百华里的悦乐川，直至贯穿在陕甘两省交界的子午岭，整整一万一千多平方公里的面积上，到处是山摇地动，人声震天。我们完全有信心，只要继续保持这种广大人民群众的革命干劲，就一定能在短时期内实现水利化。
    庆阳县的水利建设事业的高速度发展，进一步证明了“要革自然的命，必先革思想的命”这一颠扑不破的真理。几年来，庆阳县的水利建设事业的发展，是和形形色色的右倾保守思想经过反复激烈的斗争而取得的。回顾刚刚开展水利建设的时候，有些右倾保守思想严重的人，曾经用“山大沟深，基础太差，劳力太少，治山治水无能为力”等论调，阻挠过水利建设事业。我们就用重点试办，取得经验，教育全党全民的作法，首先在王家湾、南小河沟进行了重点示范，事实鼓舞了广大人民群众，有力的批判了右倾保守思想，从而大大推动了庆阳县的水利建设事业。1958年，庆阳县兴修水地二十多万亩，控制水土流失二千九百平方公里。一年成就超过了解放前的几千年，这就更加鼓舞了全县人民水利建设的高潮。
    由于水利运动的大发展，给全县工农业生产带来了巨大变化。沟壑打坝蓄水后，下游出现了大片的川台地，全县共达四十万亩以上。沟水上原后，解决了过去在沟底人畜饮水的问题，光这一项，全县可以节省将近五十万个劳动力。西峰等公社还在池塘养鱼将近百万尾。董志人民公社利用蓄水发了电，由于星罗棋布的水利设施，沤制了大量的有机质肥料，解决了几千年来董志塬上的土地缺乏氮素肥料的困难。
    尤其使人兴奋的是：水利事业的发展推动了畜牧事业的大发展。董志塬六个人民公社现在养猪六万头，其中母猪一万头。据我们初步摸底，今年春耕期间就可达到每人平均一头多猪。这一切事实给人们又一个深刻的体会是：如果只认为水是灌溉农田，那就是低估了水这个万能的东西。水不仅可以发展农业，而且可以推动工业，又是林、牧、副、渔全线大革命的重要基础。工业和林牧副渔全面大发展，反过来又促进了农业生产的高速度发展。所以说，实现水利化，是实现农业高速度发展的重要关键。我们决心一直要干到底，争取早日实现水利化。
