    Yangmeishan Coal Mine and Arshan Forestry Bureau Build Small Locomotive
    The workers of Yangmeishan Coal Mine in Hunan recently successfully self-made a small locomotive.
    This small locomotive is composed of more than two thousand parts, with a power of eighteen horsepower. It can drag twenty coal cars at a time, with a load capacity of forty-seven tons.
    Yangmeishan Coal Mine has high mountains and steep roads, making internal transportation difficult. The workers said: "People push coal carts all day long, carrying coal from the high mountains with shoulders. A daily output of a thousand tons cannot be transported completely, and good coal piles up on the ground." The birth of the small locomotive has created conditions for the mine's internal transportation to achieve rail transport and ensure normal coal mine production. After realizing rail transport within the mine, just saving on automobile transportation alone can save more than 38,000 yuan in gasoline costs and more than 12,000 yuan in car maintenance costs each year, and it can also save thirteen laborers per day.
    In order to support the great leap forward in timber transportation, more than 200 workers at the Machinery Repair Plant of Arshan Forestry Bureau in the Greater Khingan Mountains of Inner Mongolia worked cleverly and arduously for sixty-three days to successfully trial-produce a twenty-eight-ton small locomotive. This locomotive has tens of thousands of large and small parts, and the factory only has a few mechanical equipment. But difficulties could not stop the workers' soaring enthusiasm. They used the "ants gnawing at bones" method to manufacture most of the parts, and also received support from more than twenty fraternal enterprises. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 杨梅山煤矿、阿尔山林业局造出小火车头

    杨梅山煤矿、阿尔山林业局造出小火车头
    湖南杨梅山煤矿职工最近自制成功一种小火车头。
    这种小火车头由两千多个零件组成，功率为十八马力，每次可拖二十个煤车，能载重四十七吨。
    杨梅山煤矿山高路陡，矿内运输比较困难，工人们说：“人推煤车整天跑，高山运煤用肩挑，日产千吨运不完，地面好煤堆成山”。小火车头的诞生，为这个矿的矿内运输实现轨道化、保证煤矿正常生产创造了条件。实现矿内运输轨道化后，只是约省汽车运输一项，每年就可以节约三万八千多元汽油费，一万二千多元汽车维修费，每天还可以节省十三个劳动力。
    内蒙古大兴安岭阿尔山林业局机械修配厂的二百多名职工为了支援运材的大跃进，巧干、苦战六十三天，试制成功了一台二十八吨的小火车头。这台机车有成万个大小零件，厂内仅有少数几台机械设备。但是困难挡不住工人们冲天的干劲。他们用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法制造了大部分零件，另外还得到了二十多个兄弟企业的支援。　（据新华社讯）
