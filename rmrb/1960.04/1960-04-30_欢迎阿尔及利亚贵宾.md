    Welcoming Algerian Guests
    The delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, headed by Vice Premier Krim Belkacem, is coming to China for a friendly visit at the invitation of our government and will arrive in Beijing today. The Chinese people warmly welcome the representatives of the Algerian people who are fighting heroically for the independence of their motherland, and pay them high respect.
    The Chinese people have always admired the heroic struggle of the Algerian people for independence and freedom under extremely difficult conditions. After five years of national liberation war, the Algerian people have achieved significant victories. The armed forces of the Algerian people have continuously grown stronger, developing from a guerrilla force of 3,000 men into a strong national liberation army of 150,000 men, and have controlled two-thirds of the country's territory. Despite the fact that the French colonialists, with the support of the United States, are still carrying out brutal suppression of the Algerian people, and are employing all kinds of deceptive tricks, attempting to entice the Algerian people to abandon the struggle for national independence, the Algerian people, who have been tempered in battle, have neither been intimidated nor fallen into the trap of imperialism. When de Gaulle himself exposed the so-called "self-determination" farce he played, and hysterically clamored to continue to use force to eliminate the Algerian revolutionary armed forces, the heroic Algerian people were determined to carry the national liberation war to the end, and are giving the French colonial army increasingly heavy blows on all fronts in Algeria. Not long ago, Vice Premier Belkacem of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria solemnly announced to the world: "The Algerian people are prepared to resolutely continue the armed struggle until their fundamental goal—independence—is achieved."
    The heroic struggle of the Algerian people for independence has received increasing sympathy and support from the people of Africa, the people of Asia, and the people of the world. On March 30 this year, peace-loving and just people in countries around the world held activities to commemorate "Algeria Day." The Second All-African People's Conference and the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, which were held not long ago, both adopted resolutions firmly supporting the Algerian people's struggle for independence. The victory of the Algerian people's struggle inspires the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America who are suffering from imperialist oppression and enslavement to actively rise up and struggle, and also powerfully strikes at the war forces of imperialism headed by the United States, making a significant contribution to world peace.
    Although China and Algeria are thousands of miles apart, the people of our two countries have always cared for and supported each other in the common struggle against imperialist aggression. The Chinese people have resolutely supported, are resolutely supporting, and will resolutely support the just struggle of the Algerian people for national independence until they achieve complete victory. At the same time, we also regard the national liberation struggle of the Algerian people as a major support for our struggle against imperialism. This precious friendship established between the people of our two countries in the common struggle against imperialism is unbreakable.
    In recent years, the friendly exchanges between the people of China and Algeria have increased, and our friendship has grown. In particular, after the establishment of the Algerian Provisional Government, the visit to our country by the delegation of the Algerian Provisional Government composed of former Minister of Social Affairs Youssef Ben Khedda and former Minister of Armaments and Supplies Mahmoud Cherif promoted mutual understanding and mutual support between the people of our two countries. We firmly believe that this visit to our country by the delegation of the Algerian Provisional Government headed by Vice Premier Krim Belkacem will further promote the close friendship between the people of China and Algeria and strengthen the mutual cooperation and support between the people of China and Algeria in the struggle against imperialism.

### 欢迎阿尔及利亚贵宾

    欢迎阿尔及利亚贵宾
    以克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团，应我国政府的邀请，来中国进行友好访问，将在今天到达北京。中国人民热烈欢迎为祖国的独立而英勇战斗着的阿尔及利亚人民的代表们，并向他们致以崇高的敬意。
    中国人民一向以十分钦佩的心情注视着阿尔及利亚人民在极艰苦的条件下为争取独立自由而进行的英勇斗争。阿尔及利亚人民经过五年的民族解放战争，已经获得重大胜利。阿尔及利亚人民的武装力量不断发展壮大，已由三千人的游击队发展成为一支拥有十五万人的强大的民族解放军，并已控制了三分之二的国土。尽管法国殖民者，在美国的支持下，仍然在对阿尔及利亚人民进行野蛮镇压，并且施展种种欺骗手腕，妄想引诱阿尔及利亚人民放弃争取民族独立的斗争，但是，久经战斗锻炼的阿尔及利亚人民既没有被吓倒，也没有上帝国主义的圈套。在戴高乐自己揭穿了他所玩弄的所谓“自决”把戏，而歇斯底里地叫嚷着要继续用武力消灭阿尔及利亚的革命武装力量的时候，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民决心将民族解放战争进行到底，并且正在阿尔及利亚的各条战线上给予法国殖民军以越来越沉重的打击。不久前，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府贝勒卡塞姆副总理向全世界庄严地宣布：“阿尔及利亚人民准备坚决继续进行武装斗争，直到他们的根本目的——独立——实现为止。”
    阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的英勇斗争，得到了非洲人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民日益广泛的同情和支持。今年3月30日，世界各国爱好和平和正义的人民纷纷举行了纪念“阿尔及利亚日”的活动。不久以前召开的第二届全非人民大会和第二届亚非人民团结大会，都作出了坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民独立斗争的决议。阿尔及利亚人民斗争的胜利，鼓舞着非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲一切遭受帝国主义压迫和奴役的人民积极起来斗争，也有力地打击了以美国为首的帝国主义的战争势力，对于世界和平作出了重大的贡献。
    中国和阿尔及利亚虽然相距千万里之遥，但是我们两国人民在反对帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中，始终是互相关怀、互相支持的。我国人民过去、现在和将来都坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的正义斗争，直到他们取得彻底的胜利。同时，我们也把阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争看作是对我们反对帝国主义斗争的重大支持。我们两国人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中所建立起来的这种珍贵的友谊是牢不可破的。
    近几年来，中国和阿尔及利亚两国人民的友好往来日益增多，我们的友谊日益增进。特别是阿尔及利亚临时政府成立以后，以前社会事务部长优素福·本·赫达和前军备和供应部长马哈茂德·谢里夫等组成的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团对我国的访问，促进了我们两国人民的相互了解和相互支持。我们深信，这一次以克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理为首的阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团到我国访问，必将进一步促进中阿两国人民之间的亲密友谊，加强中阿两国人民在反对帝国主义斗争中的互相合作和支持。
