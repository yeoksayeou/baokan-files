I wholeheartedly endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1960 national economic plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 national financial statement and the draft 1960 national budget. I completely agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the CPPCC. From the reports of the two vice premiers, we have gained a more comprehensive understanding of the continuous Great Leap Forward of the past two years and the continued leap forward this year. We have completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan in two years and are confident of catching up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in less than ten years. This gives us great encouragement and boundless strength. We have a deeper understanding that the Great Leap Forward in construction is a great victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction, and a great victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We have a deeper understanding that the victory of the construction cause is inseparable from the victory of proletarian ideology.

In the Great Leap Forward in industry, agriculture, and other fields, a link in the education revolution, the mathematical education revolution, has also developed from its initial stage to gradual deepening under the guidance of the Party's education policy, and has yielded great results. Regarding this link, I will report on some of my personal experiences in my work. First, I will talk about two issues in mathematics teaching: the modernization of mathematics teaching and the restoration of the original face of mathematical science. The Chinese Mathematical Society convened a representative conference in Shanghai in February and March this year, and one of the main issues discussed was the modernization of the content of mathematics textbooks for primary and secondary schools. The general requirement is to shorten the years of schooling, reduce class hours, and improve quality, so as to increase productive labor throughout the primary and secondary school teaching process. At the same time, shortening the years of schooling is more conducive to the popularization of secondary education. On the other hand, from the perspective of developing modern science to serve socialist construction more effectively, the modernization of mathematics textbook content is even more urgently needed. A group at Beijing Normal University, under the leadership of the Party and based on extensive visits and key experiments, proposed a revolutionary and scientific draft plan for the modernization of mathematics textbook content for primary and secondary schools at the mathematics conference. It exposed the obsolete, backward, repetitive, and isolated situations in the current textbooks. For example, the four arithmetic operations in arithmetic can be easily dealt with using algebraic methods, but the ancient arithmetic methods are used to waste the time of young students. Plane geometry unreasonably maintains the Euclidean system of more than two thousand years ago, one-sidedly emphasizing logical reasoning, thus hindering the development of students' intuitive imagination and observation ability of concrete things, so that reasoning is not easy to master. Some of the content of plane geometry unreasonably avoids using the more superior methods of analytic geometry and calculus. Some repetitions between junior and senior high school plane geometry and algebra, the artificial division between plane geometry, algebra, and trigonometry. After a great debate among the representatives of the Mathematical Society, they unanimously agreed with the spirit of the draft and made in-depth supplements. For example, in the nine-year or ten-year consistent system draft for primary and secondary schools, not only are the basic mathematics textbooks of the current twelve-year system arranged, but also the preliminary knowledge of geometric drawing, analytic geometry, calculus and differential equations, as well as modern computers and probability theory, which are urgently needed for practical application, are added; In order to eliminate repetition and isolated situations, the learning stages of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and calculus are distinguished, and each stage contains the sprouts of the next stage. Although this draft still needs to be further improved through wider discussion and key experiments, it is already largely suitable for the requirements of the Great Leap Forward situation for mathematics teaching in primary and secondary schools.

Mathematics teaching in comprehensive universities also has serious problems. This is not only a matter of textbook content, but more significantly a matter of academic viewpoints and educational ideology. Practice - theory - practice is the path of development of all sciences, and mathematics is no exception. However, the so-called pure mathematics, a kind of idealism and metaphysics, formed in the nineteenth century, has profoundly influenced teaching in universities. For example, one-sided emphasis is placed on the inherent systematicness and logical rigor of each discipline, while neglecting the essential connections between the various mathematical disciplines, and even more neglecting how disciplines are formed from solving practical problems and how they return to practice to play a role in transforming the world. This erroneous view of pure mathematics, coupled with the universal pursuit of the obscure, also leads to the writing of many mathematical documents that make people feel like they are deliberately mystifying, making them daunting. Using such documents to teach students, without first explaining their background and purpose, students will naturally be like falling into a fog, and the effect will naturally be slow, expensive, and inefficient. Conversely, if the origin and development of the discipline can be revealed, the teaching effect will indeed be different. We use the results of the examination of the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of Peking University last semester and the experience of the mass movement of compiling textbooks during the winter vacation to illustrate this point. The examination requirements of the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of Peking University were generally raised last semester, and the examination questions were generally much deeper than in the past, but the percentage of excellent grades generally increased, generally reaching more than 85%. Even more prominent is the significant leap forward in the academic performance of worker-peasant students and student cadres in each grade. There are more worker-peasant students in the second grade, and the percentage of excellent grades they achieved in the examination exceeded the average percentage of the whole grade. In the examination for the course of differential equations, all the worker-peasant students achieved excellent grades. In the past, the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of Peking University was deeply influenced by bourgeois genius education, and the phenomenon of polarization of academic performance was very prominent. There have always been problems in the studies of student cadres and worker-peasant students. In the latter stage of last semester, the teachers improved their understanding through the study of anti-rightist tendencies, and paid more attention to the study problems of this part of the students. However, at first, they did not focus on the fundamental issues of teaching viewpoints and academic thought. At that time, they only wanted to strengthen the tutoring work for student cadres and worker-peasant students, or so-called improve their learning methods. This not only failed to grasp the key to the problem, but also failed to do it in reality. Because there was first a contradiction in time, the teachers of each course wanted to additionally increase time to grasp them, and it was impossible to arrange time at all. The Party pointed out in a timely manner that we must focus on the fundamental issues, first of all, we must take Mao Zedong Thought as the leading factor, establish correct teaching viewpoints, and make the teaching content conform to the cognitive process of practice - theory - practice. We must criticize the bourgeois idealism and metaphysical viewpoints existing in the teaching content, so as to restore the original face of mathematical science. Under the guidance of the general principles, through teaching practice, teachers realized that in the past they thought that worker-peasant students lacked the ability to abstract, but instead thought that a small number of students who were only "specialized" but not "red" had a talent for mathematics. In fact, these were all prejudices under the bourgeois teaching viewpoints and were distortions of objective facts. Once the correct viewpoints were established in teaching, it was found that it was precisely the student cadres and worker-peasant students who could reveal the essence of things and understand them deeply. They generally require to understand the practical background and specific applications of the content of definitions and theorems. When teachers point out their origin and development, they accept them quickly and deeply. In the past, the difficulties they encountered in learning were not in formal reasoning or abstract ability, but mainly because the teachers did not reveal them in the teaching process, but instead covered up the essence of the problems with incorrect viewpoints, which naturally increased their difficulties in learning. And the so-called talented students who accepted quickly in the past were precisely because they did not consider the essence of the problems, but were satisfied with formal derivation, circling around in formal logic. Once they were required to deeply grasp the essence of the problems, they showed no strengths at all. The examination results of last semester fully proved this point. After the examination, teachers and students plunged into the mass movement of adapting textbooks during the winter vacation, determined to insert the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought into the field of basic course teaching, and put forward the resounding slogans of "returning knowledge to the working people" and "refining books and refining people, books are red and people are also red." In just twelve days, they completed the first drafts of lectures for three courses: mathematical analysis, theoretical mechanics, etc. When compiling a textbook on mathematical analysis, students in the first, second, and third grades of the mathematics major read a total of 14 million words of reference materials, studied Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," and initially changed the textbook content from the perspective of dialectical materialism, further implemented the principle of linking theory with practice, thereby improving the quality of the textbook. Since the beginning of this semester, further revisions have been made in conjunction with mathematical practice. Through the above facts, the root causes of the problems existing in the current mathematics teaching in universities have been found. Many situations of being slow, expensive, and inefficient are due to the existence of bourgeois idealism and metaphysical viewpoints in the teaching content. For example, one-sided emphasis is placed on the systematicness of mathematics, and formal reasoning is placed in an inappropriate position. The teaching content only reflects one side of deductive reasoning, and ignores the side of summarizing, improving, and generalizing from practice; this will inevitably lead to the separation of theory from practice. Another example is one-sided emphasis on the rigor of theory, being strict for the sake of strictness, but instead thinking that objectively existing things are rough and not rigorous. Only mathematical definitions and axioms are the most rigorous, and everything must start from definitions and axioms, treating them as primary; this will also inevitably lead to the separation of theory from practice. In addition, like one-sided emphasis on the integrity of theory, a course forms a closed system without room for development, being complete for the sake of theoretical completeness; this will inevitably lead to artificial division between courses, disconnection from each other, and unnecessary repetition. Peking University's mathematics major is further deeply exposing and criticizing the idealistic and metaphysical viewpoints in the teaching content, breaking the old doctrines of the bourgeoisie, and creating conditions for establishing a new system of the proletariat.

Secondly, let's talk about the direction of mathematical development. Since 1958, under the call of the Party, mathematical workers across the country have gone to factories, enterprises, and other departments to find practical problems to engage in research, and have solved a large number of practical mathematical problems related to water conservancy projects, weather forecasting, construction projects, transportation, textile industry, medical and health care, as well as radio technology, artificial satellite orbits, etc., and thereby raised them to theory and developed some mathematical theories. These problems are often comprehensive, and in the process of solving them, they have also begun to break the boundaries of teaching and research offices and conduct collective research. This shows that using tasks to drive disciplines is an effective method for implementing the Party's principle of linking theory with practice in mathematical research. Another central issue discussed at this mathematics conference was the issue of development direction. Based on extensive discussion and summary of experience, the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences proposed at the meeting to use the following five tasks as the outline to drive the development of various mathematical disciplines: (1) Mathematical problems in cutting-edge technology and major projects; (2) Mathematical problems in modern physics; (3) Mathematical problems in automation; (4) Mathematical problems in the national economy; (5) A large number of calculation tasks. The conference spent most of its time discussing this issue. The representatives all clarified the correct meaning of using tasks to drive disciplines, and enthusiastically expressed that they would implement this method after returning to their posts. This is another great victory in breaking the bourgeois viewpoint of mathematics for the sake of mathematics and establishing the proletarian viewpoint of linking theory with practice. This is to restore the original face of mathematics in scientific research and give mathematics endless vitality. It can be expected that mathematical research will blossom and bear fruit more quickly and prosperously. Through the efforts of the past few years, the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of Peking University has established majors, specializations, or at least discussion groups for each of these five aspects. Especially in this year's teaching revolution movement before and after the winter vacation, the masses expressed their determination and put forward the ambitious goal of transforming disciplines; like other brother schools and research units, they want to make all disciplines embark on the correct development direction, move forward, and achieve brand-new development. Now, just taking a few more abstract mathematical disciplines as examples to illustrate the situation of scientific research that has begun to unfold: the flood analysis group of the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the algebra group of Peking University have both organized discussion groups on atomic nuclear physics. This semester, the topology group of Peking University is teaching and learning the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations needed in practical problems. Starting from practical problems, we can understand the specific sources of mathematical abstract concepts and methods and their great role in application, thereby improving understanding, broadening horizons, liberating imagination, and strengthening enthusiasm. This creates conditions for better developing mathematical disciplines and better serving social construction.

Finally, let me talk about some of my personal experiences in this excellent situation and in the torrent of mathematical education revolution. First, the leap forward of the mathematical cause, like the Great Leap Forward in other aspects of construction, is the result of the Party's leadership and Mao Zedong Thought taking command. The Great Leap Forward in other aspects of construction has prompted us mathematical workers to recognize the correct path of mathematics teaching and development direction, and the leap forward of the mathematical cause has made us mathematical workers more intimately feel the unparalleled greatness of Marxism-Leninism. We must resolutely move towards being both red and expert, and we must eliminate the influence of the bourgeois ideology of theory divorced from practice on us. Second, like the Great Leap Forward in all construction undertakings, the leap forward in the mathematical cause, as mentioned above, is the result of the mass movement under the leadership of the Party. The wisdom and strength of the masses are unparalleled. We must resolutely throw ourselves into the mass movement and contribute each person's small strength. These are some of my superficial experiences. There are still shortcomings, and I hope comrades will give me guidance. I want to start from these preliminary experiences and thoroughly transform my worldview through diligent study and diligent work.

    数学教育必须进行革命
    江泽涵委员的发言
    我衷心地拥护李富春副总理的1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理的1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告；完全同意陈叔通副主席的政协工作的报告。从两位副总理的报告，我们更全面地了解到前两年的连续大跃进以及今年的继续跃进，两年内完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标，有信心在比十年更短的时间内在工业主要产品产量方面赶上英国。这给我们以极大的鼓舞，无比的力量。我们更加体会到，建设事业的大跃进是党的社会主义建设的总路线的伟大胜利，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我们更加体会到，建设事业的胜利和无产阶级思想的胜利是分不开的。
    在工农业等各方面的大跃进中，教育革命的一个环节，数学教育革命，也在党的教育方针指导下从开展到逐步深入，有了巨大的收获。对于这个环节，我汇报个人工作时的一些体会。首先谈数学教学方面的两个问题：数学教学的现代化和恢复数学科学的本来面目。中国数学会今年2、3月间在上海召开了代表大会，讨论的主要问题之一是中小学数学教材内容现代化的问题。总的要求是要缩短年限，减少学时，提高质量，这样可以在整个中小学教学过程中，增加生产劳动。同时由于年限的缩短，更有利于中学教育的普及。另一方面，从发展现代科学以更有效地为社会主义建设服务着眼，更迫切需要数学教材内容的现代化。北京师大的一个小组，在党的领导下，根据广泛访问和重点试验的结果，在数学会上提出了一个富有革命性和科学性的中小学数学教材内容现代化的草案。它揭露了现行教材中陈腐落后重复孤立的情况。例如算术中的四则难题，本来可以很容易地用代数方法处理，而却要用古老的算术方法来消磨年幼学生的时间，平面几何不合理地保持了两千多年前的欧几里得的系统，片面强调逻辑推理因而阻碍了学生直观想像能力和对具体事物的观察能力的发展，以致推理也不易掌握。平面几何的部分内容不合理地避免用更优越的解析几何和微积分的方法处理。初中、高中的平面几何以及代数的一些重复，平面几何、代数和三角之间的人为的割裂。数学会的代表们大辩论之后，一致赞成这草案的精神，并作了深入的补充。例如在中小学九年或十年一贯制草案中，不仅安排了现行十二年制的数学基本教材，并且增加实际应用所急需的几何制图、解析几何、微积分和微分方程初步，以及近代的计算机、概率论等初步知识；为着消灭重复和孤立情况，既区分算术、代数、几何、微积分等的学习阶段，又使得每一阶段孕育着下一阶段的萌芽。这个草案虽还要在更广泛的讨论和重点试验中再行改进，但它已在很大程度上适合了大跃进形势对于中小学数学教学的要求。
    综合性大学里数学教学同样地也有严重问题。这已不仅是教材内容的问题，而更显著的是学术观点和教育思想的问题。实践——理论——实践，是一切科学发展的道路，数学也非例外。但在十九世纪形成了所谓纯粹数学这种唯心主义和形而上学观点，极深地影响到大学中的教学。例如片面地强调各学科的自身系统性、逻辑严密性，而忽视各数学学科之间的本质联系，更忽视了学科如何从解决实际问题而形成，如何回到实际去发挥改造世界的作用。纯粹数学这种错误观点，再加上普遍性的盲目追求，也导致不少数学文献的写法使人觉得是故弄玄虚，望而生畏。用这样的文献来教学生，不先而说明其背景和目的性，学生自然如堕五里雾中，效果自然是少慢差费。反过来，如果能揭露学科的来龙去脉，教学的效果就确是不同。我们用北京大学数学力学系上学期的考试结果和寒假中编写教材的群众运动的经验来说明这一个问题。北大数学力学系上学期的考试要求是普遍提高了，考题一般比过去要深得多，但是考试成绩的优良百分比普遍上升，一般达到85％以上。更突出的是每一年级工农同学与学生干部的学习成绩，都有显著的跃进。二年级的工农同学比较多，他们考试成绩的优良百分比超过了全年级的平均百分比。微分方程这门课程的考试成绩，工农同学全部达到了优良成绩。北大数学力学系过去受到资产阶级天才教育的影响比较深，学习成绩两极分化的现象很突出，学生干部与工农同学的学习，一向存在着问题。上学期的后一阶段，由于教师们通过反右倾的学习，提高了认识，更重视这部分学生的学习问题。但最初还没有从教学观点与学术思想的根本问题上着眼，当时只是想加强对学生干部与工农同学的辅导工作，或是所谓改进他们的学习方法。这样不仅没有抓着问题的关键，而且事实也做不到。因为时间首先就有矛盾，每门课程的教师，都想额外增加时间去抓他们，根本就无法安排时间。党及时指出了必须从根本问题上着眼，首先要以毛泽东思想为主导，树立正确的教学观点，使教学内容符合于实践——理论——实践的认识过程，对教学内容中存在的资产阶级唯心主义与形而上学观点，必须加以批判，从而恢复数学科学的本来面目。教师在总的原则指导下，通过教学实践，认识到过去认为工农同学缺乏抽象的能力，反而认为一小部分只“专”不红的学生有天赋的数学才能，其实都是在资产阶级教学观点下的偏见，是对客观事实的歪曲，一旦在教学上树立了正确的观点，就发现能揭露事物的本质，认识得深刻的，恰好是学生干部与工农同学。他们对定义和定理的内容，一般都要求了解它们的实际背景与具体应用，当教师指出了它们的来龙去脉以后，他们就接受得快而且深刻。过去他们学习上发生困难，并非在形式推理上或抽象能力上有缺陷，主要是在教学过程中教师没有去揭露，反而用不正确的观点掩盖了问题的本质，这样自然增加了他们学习上的困难。而过去所谓接受得快的天才学生，正是由于他们不去考虑问题的本质，满足于形式上的推导，在形式逻辑中兜圈子，一旦要求深入掌握问题的本质时，他们就显得毫无所长了。上学期的考试成绩，就充分证明了这一点。考试以后，教师与同学在寒假中投入了改编教材的群众运动，坚决要把毛泽东思想的红旗，插上基础课教学的领域，提出了“要把知识还给劳动人民”与“炼书又炼人，书红人亦红”的响亮口号，在短短十二天内，完成了数学分析、理论力学等三门课程的讲义初稿。在编写数学分析一门教材时，数学专业的一、二、三年级学生总共阅读了一千四百万字的参考资料，学习了毛主席的“实践论”和“矛盾论”，初步以辩证唯物主义的观点，改变了教材内容，进一步贯彻了理论联系实际的方针，从而提高了教材的质量。这学期以来，进一步结合数学实践，加以修订。通过以上这些事实，找到了当前大学的数学教学中存在问题的根源，许多少慢差费的情况，都是由于教学内容中存在着资产阶级唯心主义与形而上学观点。例如片面强调数学的系统性，把形式推理摆在不恰当的位置，教学内容只反映演绎推理的一面，忽略从实践中总结、提高、归纳的一面；这样必然导致理论与实际的脱节。又例如片面强调理论的严密性，为严格而严格，反而认为客观存在的事物是粗糙的，不严格的，只有数学的定义和公理才是最严格的，一切都要从定义和公理出发，把它看作是第一性的；这样也必然导致理论与实际的脱节。另外像片面强调理论的完整性，一门课程形成一个没有发展余地的封闭系统，为理论的完整而完整；这样必然会导致课程之间的人为割裂，彼此脱节以及不必要的重复。北大数学专业正在进一步深入揭露和批判教学内容中的唯心主义与形而上学的观点，打破资产阶级的旧学说，为建立无产阶级的新系统创造条件。
    其次谈一谈数学发展方向的问题。从1958年以来，全国数学工作者已在党的号召下，到工厂企业部门等处找实际问题从事研究，曾解决了有关水利工程、气象预报、建筑工程、交通运输、纺织工业、医药卫生以及无线电技术、人造卫星轨道等方面中的大量实际数学问题，并从而提高到理论，发展了一些数学理论。这些问题常常是综合性的，在解决的过程中也开始打破教研室的界限而集体研究。这说明了以任务带动学科，是在数学研究中贯彻党的理论联系实际的方针的有效方法。这次数学会所讨论的另一中心问题就是发展方向的问题。根据广泛的讨论和经验的总结，中国科学院数学研究所在会上提出了以下列五个方面的任务为纲，来带动数学各学科的发展：（一）尖端技术和重大工程中的数学问题；（二）现代物理学中的数学问题；（三）自动化中的数学问题；（四）国民经济中的数学问题；（五）大量计算任务。大会用了大部分时间讨论这个问题。代表们都明确了以任务带动学科的正确意义，并热烈地表示回到岗位去后要贯彻这种方法。这又是破为数学而数学的资产阶级观点、立理论联系实际的无产阶级观点的一次伟大胜利。这才是在科学研究方面恢复了数学的本来面目，给予了数学以无穷无尽的生命力。可以预期，数学研究将更为迅速、更加繁盛地开花结果。北大数学力学系经过这几年来的努力，针对这五个方面的每一个，或者建立了专业，或者建立了专门化，或者至少也成立了讨论班。特别是在今年的寒假前后的教学革命运动中，群众表示了决心，提出改造学科的雄心大志；要和各兄弟学校研究单位一样，要使各学科走上正确发展方向，迈步前进，得到崭新的发展。现在只就较抽象的几个数学学科，举例说明开始展开科学研究的情况：中国科学院数学研究所汛函分析小组和北大代数小组都组织了原子核物理的讨论班，北大拓朴小组本学期边教边学实际问题中所需要的常微分方程的定性理论。从实际问题出发，才了解到数学的抽象概念与方法的具体来源以及在应用时的巨大作用，从而提高了理解，扩大了眼界，解放了想像力，加强了干劲。这就为更好地发展数学学科，更好地为社会建设服务创造了条件。
    最后，谈一谈我个人在这种极好的形势下，和在数学教育革命的洪流中的一些体会。第一，数学事业的跃进，和其它各方面建设事业的大跃进一样，是党的领导和毛泽东思想挂帅的结果。其它各方面建设事业的大跃进，促使我们数学工作者认识到数学教学和发展方向的正确途径，而且数学事业的跃进，使我们数学工作者更亲切地体会到马克思列宁主义的无比伟大。我们要坚决地奔向又红又专，要肃清理论脱离实际的资产阶级的思想对我们的影响。第二，和一切建设事业的大跃进一样，数学事业的跃进，如上面所说的，都是在党的领导下群众运动的成果。群众的智慧和力量是无比的，我们要坚决地投身到群众运动中去，贡献每个人的微小力量。这是我一些肤浅的体会，还有不够之处，希望同志们指教。我要从这些初步体会开始，通过认真地学习认真地工作得到世界观的彻底改造。
