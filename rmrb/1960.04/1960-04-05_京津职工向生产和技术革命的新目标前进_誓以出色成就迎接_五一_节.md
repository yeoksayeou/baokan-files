    Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: Beijing's industrial workers, having achieved a sustained and comprehensive leap forward in production in the first quarter, are advancing victoriously, ensuring April surpasses March, working hard for thirty days, and greeting International Labor Day "May Day" with outstanding production achievements.
    Many factories have convened worker representative conferences, oath-taking rallies, cadre meetings at all levels, and various on-site meetings to formulate new plans, propose new tasks, and strive towards new goals in production and technological revolution. Beijing Chemical Plant No. 2 analyzed each production link item by item, identified one hundred and fifty-three major problems, and after research, solutions have been found for one hundred and five problems, and key issues such as salt water neutralization and stirring, settling and purification, and chemical sizing have been tackled. The foundry and forging workers of various factories in the city's electromechanical system held representative meetings of the same trades to further summarize experience into sets and organize its promotion. Workers at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant are currently rushing to implement innovation projects such as automatic lines for processing high-grade miscellaneous parts. More than thirty factories in the textile system held experience exchange meetings, determined to universally achieve mechanization of doffing and weft insertion, and to produce new products such as high-grade poplin of 100-count yarn and 200-count nylon robu yarn in April.
    In the climax of presenting gifts to "May Day", many factories have achieved a good start in production in April. The Jingxi Mining Bureau's coal production on April 1st exceeded the plan by 13%, an increase of 8.61% compared to the average daily output in the first quarter. On April 1st, the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory realized more than one hundred innovation projects, with output value and output exceeding the plan by 27% and 22% respectively.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 4th: On the basis of achieving a comprehensive leap forward in production during the "Spring Production Sports Meet," workers on Tianjin's industrial front have launched a socialist labor competition to "Greet the May Day Great Battle." All workers are determined to comprehensively overfulfill the national plan for April, making April surpass March; better support the technical transformation of agriculture; vigorously engage in comprehensive and systematic technological transformation centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation; advance towards high precision and advanced technology, and actively learn and promote advanced experience.
    The "champions", "runners-up", "labor athletes", and production experts from all walks of life in the city's industrial front's Spring Production Sports Meet held a 10,000-person oath-taking rally and competition on the 3rd to "Greet the May Day Great Battle." Many factories and enterprises put forward new goals and guarantee measures at the meeting. Their common guarantee is that while comprehensively overfulfilling the national plan for April, the city's mechanization and semi-mechanization level will reach 70%, and five hundred automatic production lines and two thousand automated single machines will be realized.
    The "Spring Production Sports Meet" carried out on Tianjin's industrial front has widely organized workers into the ranks of socialist labor competition. Through vigorously engaging in technical innovation and technical revolution, the city's mechanization and semi-mechanization level has increased from 52% at the end of last year to 62% at the end of March this year. Due to the increased level of mechanization, in the first quarter, the city's total industrial output value increased by 64.84% compared with the same period last year, and labor productivity increased by 67.12% compared with the same period last year. In January and February, more than 1,100 new products were successfully trial-produced, including more than 400 high-precision and advanced products.

    京津职工向生产和技术革命的新目标前进
    誓以出色成就迎接“五一”节
    据新华社4日讯　北京市工业战线职工在夺得第一季度生产持续全面跃进的胜利之后，又乘胜前进，保证4月超3月，大干三十天，以出色的生产成绩迎接“五一”国际劳动节。
    许多工厂召开了职工代表大会、誓师比武大会、各级干部会和各种现场会，制定新的规划，提出新的任务，向生产和技术革命的新目标奋勇前进。北京化工二厂逐项分析了各个生产环节，找出一百五十三个较大的问题，经过研究，已经有一百零五个问题找到解决方案，并且已经攻下了盐水中和搅拌、沉净、化胶等关键。全市机电系统各工厂的铸工和锻工召开同工种代表会，进一步把经验总结成套，组织推广。北京第一机床厂的职工正在突击实现高级杂件加工自动线等革新项目。纺织系统的三十多个工厂召开了经验交流会，决心普遍实现落纱和装纬机械化，并且在4月份生产出一百支纱的合股线高级府绸、二百支纱尼龙罗布等新产品。
    在向“五一”节献礼的高潮中，许多工厂都夺得了4月生产开门红。京西矿务局4月1日煤产量超过计划13％，比第一季度平均日产量提高了8.61％。北京电子管厂4月1日实现了一百多项革新项目，产值、产量分别超额27％和22％完成了计划。
    据新华社天津4日电　天津市工业战线职工在“春季生产运动会”中取得生产全面跃进的基础上，又展开了“迎接五一大会战”的社会主义劳动竞赛。全体职工决心要做到全面超额完成4月份国家计划，作到4月超3月；更好地支援农业技术改造；大搞以机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化为中心的全面系统的技术改造；向高精尖进军，积极学习与推广先进经验。
    全市工业战线各行各业的春季生产运动会“冠军”、“亚军”、“劳动健将”和生产能手们，在3日举行“迎接五一大会战”的万人誓师比武大会。许多工厂企业都在会上提出了新的奋斗目标和保证措施。他们的共同保证是：在全面超额完成4月份国家计划的同时，使全市机械化半机械化程度达到70％，并实现五百条自动生产线和两千台自动化单机。
    天津市工业战线开展的“春季生产运动会”，已经把职工们广泛地组织到社会主义劳动竞赛的行列中来。通过大闹技术革新和技术革命，全市机械化半机械化程度已从去年年底的52％提高到今年3月底的62％。由于机械化程度提高，第一季度，全市工业总产值比去年同期增长64.84％，劳动生产率比去年同期提高67.12％。1、2月份还试制成功一千一百多种新产品，其中高精尖产品就有四百多种。
