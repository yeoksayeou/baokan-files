Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft 1960 National Economic Plan" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the Draft 1960 National Budget." I also fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC." Vice Chairman Chen's report points out that in 1959, the National Committee of the CPPCC systematically conducted work on social figures and the families of people from all walks of life, and pointed out that this year, it is necessary to continue to actively promote social figures and the families of people from all walks of life to participate in street production and various work, and to help them carry out political study. With the development of the Great Leap Forward, major cities across the country are vigorously establishing people's communes, street industries, public welfare undertakings, and public canteens, extensively organizing the economic life of residents, further organizing the urban people, and liberating tens of thousands of urban housewives from household labor to participate in various socialist construction undertakings. Under these circumstances, we believe that this measure of the National Committee of the CPPCC is very correct and necessary. In order to earnestly implement the spirit of this instruction, local CPPCCs and various democratic parties should actively mobilize social members and social figures scattered in various aspects of society who do not have fixed jobs, as well as their families, and promote them to actively serve the cause of socialist construction and carry out self-remolding in the service. Now, I would like to give a brief report to the conference on the situation of the Tianjin Civil Revolutionary Organization (Min Ge) in promoting social members, social figures and their families to participate in social service and carry out self-remolding.

Tianjin is a city with a large number of social figures. Since the high tide of the three major transformations, the Min Ge has cooperated with the municipal and district CPPCCs to carry out the work of uniting, educating, and remolding social figures in an organized and planned manner. The Min Ge mainly contacts upper-level figures, most of whom are military and political personnel and upper-level figures in the financial and educational circles during the late Qing Dynasty, the Beiyang government, and the Kuomintang rule. As they themselves say, their main characteristics are "three highs," namely: high age, high blood pressure, and high past status. They have a certain level of education and also have a certain influence in the strata they are associated with. Some of them have long been accustomed to a life of comfort and ease, their old ideological consciousness is very strong, they do not know the new society when they see it, and before the anti-rightist rectification campaign, they wanted arrangements and fame, and doubted or even resisted the Party's policies. When the rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party, many people experienced serious wavering, and some even stepped to the edge of danger. All this shows that whether it is to help them keep up with the times, or to reduce the resistance to building socialism, it is necessary to work on them, this is one aspect. On the other hand, after liberation, through successive political movements, they have been constantly inspired by the Party's policies, and the anti-rightist struggle and rectification campaign have also given them great education, and their thinking has also undergone great changes. Some people compared themselves with the words and deeds of the rightists, found that they had many problems, and felt shocking; when confiding in the Party, they distinguished right from wrong by presenting the facts, reasoning, and analyzing and criticizing, and admitted that the new society led by the Communist Party was better than the old society in which they had been in power. Then, the situation of the Great Leap Forward made many elderly social figures see that the broad masses of working people were exerting soaring energy to build socialism, and everywhere presented a scene of prosperity; when they returned home, they saw their children at their jobs, often going out early and returning late, fighting overnight; the housewives in the same courtyard also left their homes to participate in work. All of this inspired them, and they also felt that the situation was pressing, and they must strengthen the fundamental remolding of their political stand, contribute to socialism, so as to adapt to the development of the situation and not be abandoned by the times. These situations show that it is not only necessary to work on them and mobilize their positive factors to serve socialism, but also possible. So, how do we promote them to participate in social service and actively carry out self-remolding in the service? Generally speaking, under the leadership of the Party, according to the policy of mobilizing all positive factors to serve socialism, starting from their actual situation, we organize them to participate in study, participate in street work, participate in various social and political activities and visits, and participate in productive labor within their capacity. The forms and methods of activities are diverse, and the content of activities is rich and colorful. And all these activities are carried out under the advocacy of doing "a hundred good deeds" for socialism. The so-called "hundred good deeds" has a very wide range, such as publicizing policies, eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, helping people find their way on the road, helping the elderly and the young cross the street, etc. Anything that is beneficial to the people and helps the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, even if it is bit by bit, is counted as a "good deed." The so-called "hundred" means doing more good deeds, not a limit. It can be thousands of things. This is mainly based on their conditions and the principle of voluntariness, doing what they can, doing what they want, and doing as much as they can. After the "hundred good deeds" initiative was put forward, it received a positive response from social members and social figures. Therefore, they started by participating in the national steel smelting campaign, and then participated in running street canteens, nurseries, patriotic health campaigns, increasing production and practicing economy, thrift and housekeeping, and patriotic savings activities. Moreover, the number of participants was also quite common. According to the statistics of 120 social members, except for 37 people who were unable to work due to physical weakness and illness, the remaining 83 people participated in certain social work and productive labor, and made many achievements. Some of them became hygiene models, and some were selected as advanced workers in the streets or active elements in eliminating illiteracy, and were welcomed by the masses. At the same time, through this period of practice, they also enhanced their confidence in serving socialism, and reversed the past erroneous ideas of some people who believed that they were old and weak, had no expertise, or had no job and could not serve the people. Facts have proved that as long as they have the sincere intention to serve socialism, and can truly put down their airs, the road to service is broad, and they will surely make better achievements.

From the above work, we have learned that carrying out the "hundred good deeds" activity among social figures must be closely combined with the political tasks and central work of each period in order to have rich activity content. In July 1957, there was a temporary and partial shortage of certain daily necessities in the market. The Tianjin Municipal People's Congress had discussed this issue and made a resolution calling on the people of the city to actively participate in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. According to this call, we cooperated with the municipal and district CPPCCs to jointly organize social figures and social women to study the resolution of the congress, help them clarify their thinking and improve their understanding. After studying and on the basis of their improved understanding, we called on them to carry out extensive publicity work to their relatives, friends, and the masses. In this way, not only did they improve their understanding and eliminate resistance, but they also actively carried out publicity and education work, turning from passive to active. At the same time, they also collected the reflections and opinions they heard in the publicity and further combined them with study for discussion, or reflected them to the relevant departments for reference. One 60-year-old social woman, who had not been out of the house for several years due to poor health, publicized to 47 households alone in this publicity work. Another 68-year-old woman, who was also not in good health, had publicized to more than 200 households alone. A total of 30 social figures publicized to 947 people. An 78-year-old man had been walking in two gardens for more than 20 years. Before participating in study and carrying out the "hundred good deeds" activity, he thought he was "full of knowledge" and also "full of complaints." He naturally sympathized with strange talks. After participating in activities and improving his understanding, he patiently and repeatedly carried out publicity work anytime and anywhere. The small garden was originally a place for spreading rumors and saying strange things. After they changed their thinking and carried out publicity work, the atmosphere of the small garden also changed. The above shows that combining political tasks and central work to organize social figures to carry out the "hundred good deeds" activity is an effective way to promote them to serve socialism and carry out self-remolding.

The "hundred good deeds" activity of social figures is one of the specific forms of service, and it is also a process of self-remolding. Past situations show that through the "hundred good deeds" activity, they have not only played a certain positive role in the cause of socialism, but also have had relatively significant changes in their political thinking. Because they have put down their airs, participated in labor, and approached the masses, they have strengthened their connection with the masses; many people no longer only consider personal fame and gain, and have begun to understand that they should care about others and care about the collective. More importantly, by doing "a hundred good deeds," they have linked themselves with socialism, further realized the brilliance and correctness of the Party's leadership, increased their patriotic enthusiasm, and improved their relationship with the Party. One social figure had studied in the United States and served the British in the Kailuan Mining Bureau for more than 20 years. He did not believe that China could be industrialized; he did not believe that it could catch up with the United Kingdom in 15 years. After being mobilized to do "a hundred good deeds" and translate the instruction manuals for export machines for the Machinery Import and Export Corporation, he realized that the new China was really amazing, and even such precise things as "electronic temperature controllers" could not only be manufactured, but also exported, and he believed that China would soon catch up with the United Kingdom. At the same time, he realized that without the leadership of the Communist Party, China could not have such huge changes. Since then, he has become more active and serious in his translation work and eliminated his inferiority complex left over from his years of serving foreigners, and increased his national self-esteem.

The elderly social figures who participated in the toy processing factory have also had changes in their thinking and feelings after labor. Their attitude towards labor has changed from fear to not fear, and their views on the working people have also changed. They welcome others to call them "old apprentices" and regard it as an honorable title. When an old gentleman received his first salary, he bought a new pair of shoes. When he returned home, his son said happily that this was bought with the money you earned from labor. Wearing them, we will walk the socialist road together. In this way, he and his children have a common language, and the relationship between the family is more harmonious than before. Because participating in labor has improved their health, some people call the processing workshop a "sanatorium" or a "health station."

Practice has proved that carrying out the "hundred good deeds" activity is a better form of implementing the policy of combining service and remolding. Doing a hundred good deeds itself is service, and the process of service is also the process of self-remolding. The two promote each other and are closely combined. Every step forward on the road of service will inevitably involve the struggle between two roads, two kinds of thinking, and two worldviews, such as from fearing labor to not fearing labor, which is essentially the struggle between two kinds of thinking: is labor glorious or shameful? In participating in labor, they have received the care of the Party, the welcome of the masses, and the encouragement of their children. At the same time, in the practice of labor, they have also realized that every needle and thread, every vegetable and meal, is indeed hard-won. Thus, they realized that labor is glorious and great, and that the life of exploitation is shameful. In fact, this is the mutual combination of service and remolding.

On the basis of relatively significant achievements in both service and remolding, we have held many experience exchange meetings for the "hundred good deeds" activity, ideological report meetings, and exhibition of service and remolding achievements. The exhibits include medals, certificates, and various souvenirs obtained by social figures in service due to their good achievements, statistical charts of achievements in serving socialism, and photos and poems expressing personal progress and ideological changes. At the same time, through the literary and artistic forms of the gala, they sang the songs they wrote and the model deeds of personal leap forward. For example, a "centenarian" chorus composed of 30 social figures, with an 80-year-old man as the conductor, sang songs of the Great Leap Forward; there were Shuanghuang quick talks of "I say me" and "I sing me" and the one-act play "Old but Strong"; social women also wrote and performed the drama "Ten Years of Change," fully expressing their happy mood. This has a tremendous encouragement to consolidate the existing achievements in service and remolding and encourage them to continue to move forward.

In short, we feel that the "hundred good deeds" activity is one of the effective ways to mobilize social figures to serve socialist construction and strengthen remolding through service. It shows that although social figures vary in age, education, and physical strength, as long as they put politics in command and have the sincere intention to serve socialism, they can all contribute to socialist construction. Their bodies are also exercised, their moods are pleasant, and their spirits are happy.

We are further developing the "hundred good deeds" activity of social figures in accordance with existing experience and around the current central work. We are also organizing them to study Chairman Mao's works, strengthen self-remolding, and help the broad masses of social figures and us to happily embark on the broad road of socialism and actively contribute to the cause of socialism.

Finally, I wish the conference success and all committee members good health.

    参加社会服务和进行自我改造
    杨亦周委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，我还完全同意陈叔通副主席所作的“政协第三届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告”。陈副主席的报告指出，1959年，政协全国委员会，有计划地对社会人士和各界人士的家属进行了工作，并指出今年要继续积极地推动社会人士以及各界人士的家属，参加街道生产和各种工作，帮助他们进行政治学习。随着大跃进形势的发展，全国各大城市正在大办人民公社、大办街道工业、大搞公共福利事业、大办公共食堂，广泛地组织居民的经济生活，把城市人民进一步地组织起来，并且使成千成万的城市家庭妇女，从家务劳动中解放出来，参加各项社会主义建设事业。在这种情况下，我们认为政协全国委员会的这个措施，是非常正确和必要的。为了切实贯彻执行这一指示精神，地方政协和各民主党派，应该积极地将散处在社会各个方面的，没有固定工作岗位的社会成员和社会人士，以及他们的家属调动起来，推动他们积极的为社会主义建设事业服务，并在服务中进行自我改造。现在，我想就天津市民革组织推动社会成员、社会人士和他们的家属，参加社会服务和进行自我改造的情况，向大会作一个简略的汇报。
    天津，是一个社会人士较多的城市。自三大改造高潮之后，民革就协同市、区政协有组织、有计划地开展了对社会人士的团结、教育和改造工作。民革所联系的多是一些上层人士，他们大都是清末、北洋和国民党统治时代的军政人员与金融界、教育界的上层人士。正如他们自己所说：他们的主要特点是“三高”，即：年龄高、血压高、过去地位高。他们有一定的文化水平，在他们所联系的阶层中，也有一定的影响。他们当中有些人长期过惯了养尊处优的生活，旧的思想意识很浓厚，对新社会是相见不相识，在反右整风以前，他们要安排、闹名位，对党的方针政策发生怀疑，甚至抵触。当右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，不少人都发生了严重的动摇，有人甚至步入了危险的边沿。这一切可以表明，无论是从帮助他们跟上时代，或者是为了减少建设社会主义的阻力来讲，都有必要对他们进行工作，这是一方面。另一方面，他们在解放以后经过历次政治运动，不断地受到党的政策的感召，加以反右派斗争和整风运动，又给了他们很大的教育，思想上也有了很大变化。有的人以右派分子的言行来对照自己，发现自己问题很多，感到触目惊心；在向党交心时，通过摆事实、讲道理和分析批判，明辨了是非，承认了共产党所领导的新社会，比自己当过权的旧社会好。接着，全民大跃进的形势，使许多年老的社会人士看到广大劳动人民为了建设社会主义，发挥出冲天的干劲，到处呈现了一片繁荣兴旺的景象；回到家里，看到子女在工作岗位上，经常是早出晚归，连夜奋战；同院的家庭妇女，也走出家庭参加了工作。所有这些，都使他们受到鼓舞，也感到形势逼人，必须加强政治立场的根本改造，为社会主义贡献力量，才能适应形势的发展，才不致于为时代所抛弃。这些情况表明，对他们进行工作，调动他们的积极因素为社会主义服务，不仅是必要的，而且也是可能的。那么，我们是怎样推动他们参加社会服务工作，并在服务中积极进行自我改造的呢？总的说来，是在党的领导下，根据调动一切积极因素为社会主义服务的方针，从他们的实际情况出发，组织他们参加学习，参加街道工作，参加各项社会政治活动和参观活动以及力所能及的生产劳动等，活动的方式方法多种多样，活动的内容是丰富多彩的。而这一切活动，都是在为社会主义作“百件好事”的倡导下进行的。所谓“百件好事”，它的范围是很广的，诸如宣传政策、除四害、讲卫生、在马路上帮人领路、扶老携幼过街等等，凡是有利于人民、有助于社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的事情，那怕是点点滴滴，都算作“好事”。所谓“百件”是多作好事的意思，并不是一个限额，可以是千件万件，这主要是根据他们的条件和自愿的原则，量力而为，愿作什么就作什么，能作什么就作什么，愿多作能多作的可以尽量多作。“百件好事”倡议提出后，得到社会成员和社会人士的积极响应，于是，他们从参加全民炼钢铁开始，接着又参加了办街道食堂，托儿所，爱国卫生运动，增产节约、勤俭持家和爱国储蓄等活动，而且，参加的人数也相当普遍。就一百二十个社会成员的统计情况来看，除了三十七人因体弱多病行动不便，而无法工作的以外，其余八十三名都分别参加了一定的社会工作和生产劳动，并且做出了不少成绩，有的当了卫生模范，有的被选为街道上的先进工作者或扫盲的积极分子，受到了群众的欢迎。同时，经过这一段实践，也增强了他们为社会主义服务的信心，扭转了过去有些人认为自己年老体弱，学无专长或没有工作岗位无法为人民服务等等错误思想。事实证明，只要自己具有为社会主义服务的诚心实意，并且能够真正放下架子，服务的道路是宽广的，也一定会做出较好的成绩。
    从以上的工作中我们体会到社会人士中开展“百件好事”活动必须紧密地结合各个时期的政治任务和中心工作才会有丰富的活动内容。1957年7月间市场上曾经出现了某些日常用品暂时的局部紧张的现象，天津市人民代表大会曾就这一问题进行过讨论，并作出了决议，号召全市人民积极参加增产节约运动。根据这一号召我们曾协同市政协及各区政协共同组织社会人士，社会妇女学习了大会的决议，帮助他们澄清了思想提高了认识。经过学习，在他们的认识有所提高的基础上，又号召他们向其所联系的亲友和群众进行广泛的宣传工作。这样，不但他们提高了认识，解除了抵触情绪，而且还积极开展了宣传教育工作，由消极化为积极，同时还把他们在宣传中听到的反映与意见搜集上来进一步结合学习进行讨论，或反映给有关部门参考。有一位六十岁的社会妇女，一向身体不好，几年未出大门，在这次宣传工作中一个人就宣传了四十七户。另一位六十八岁的妇女，身体也不太健康，一个人曾宣传了二百多户。有三十名社会人士共计宣传了九百四十七人，一位七十八岁的老人，在两个花园散步二十余年，在参加学习和开展“百件好事”活动之前，自以为“经纶满腹”同时也是“牢骚满腹”，听了怪话自然就同情；在参加活动提高了认识之后，却随时随地耐心、反复地作宣传工作。小花园本来是散播流言蜚语，讲怪话的地方，经过他们在思想转变以后开展了宣传工作，小花园的气氛也改变了。以上说明，结合政治任务和中心工作组织社会人士开展
  “百件好事”活动是推动他们为社会主义服务和进行自我改造的有效方式。
    社会人士的“百件好事”活动是服务的具体形式之一，同时也是自我改造的过程。过去的情况表明，通过百件好事活动，他们不仅对社会主义事业发挥了一定的积极作用。而且在政治思想上也起了比较显著的变化。由于他们放下了架子，参加了劳动，接近了群众，因而加强了同群众的联系；许多人不再只考虑个人名利，开始懂得应该关心别人，关心集体了。更重要的是，通过作“百件好事”他们同社会主义挂上了钩，进一步认识到党的领导的英明正确，增加了爱国热情，改善了同党的关系。有一位社会人士曾经留学美国，在开滦矿务局为英国人服务二十多年，他不相信中国可以工业化；不相信十五年能赶上英国。经动员他作“百件好事”为机械进出口公司翻译出口机器说明书后，他认识到新中国真是了不起，连“电子温度控制器”这样精密的东西不但能够制造，而且还出口了，相信我国很快即可赶上英国。同时，他认识到没有共产党的领导中国是不可能有这样巨大变化的。从此，他对翻译工作更加积极认真了。并消除了他由于多年为外国人服务所遗留下来的自卑感，增加了民族自尊心。
    参加玩具加工厂的年老的社会人士，经过劳动，思想感情也都有了变化，对劳动由怕到不怕，对劳动人民的看法也有了转变，他们欢迎别人称他们是“老徒工”，认为这是一个光荣的称号。有一位老先生在第一次发工资时，买了一双新鞋，回到家里，他儿子很高兴的说，这是你劳动的钱买来的，穿上它，我们一起走社会主义道路。这样，他和儿女之间也就有了共同的语言，家庭之间的关系也较前融洽了。由于参加劳动增进了健康，有的人把加工车间叫作“疗养院”或“保健站”。
    实践证明，开展“百件好事”活动的过程，是贯彻服务与改造相结合方针的较好形式，做百件好事本身就是服务，而服务的过程也就是自我改造的过程，两者是互相促进，紧密结合的。在服务的道路上每前进一步，都不可避免地要展开两条道路、两种思想、两个世界观的斗争，如由害怕劳动到不怕劳动，实质上就是：劳动究竟是光荣还是可耻两种思想的斗争。他们在参加劳动中受到了党的关怀、群众的欢迎和子女的鼓励。同时，在劳动实践中，也使他们体会到一针一线、一菜一饭、确实来之不易。从而认识到劳动是光荣、伟大的，剥削生活是可耻的。事实上，这就是服务与改造的互相结合。
    在服务与改造都有了比较显著成绩的基础上，举办了多次“百件好事”活动经验交流会、思想汇报会和服务与改造成绩展览会。展品中有社会人士在服务中由于获得了较好的成绩，而获得的奖章、奖状和各种纪念品，有为社会主义服务的成绩统计图表，也有表达个人进步和思想变化的像片和诗画。同时还通过联欢晚会的文艺形式，演唱了他们自己编写的歌曲和个人的跃进模范事迹。如有由三十位社会人士组成的“古稀老人”合唱队，由一位八十高龄的老人担任指挥，合唱了大跃进的歌曲；有“我说我”“我唱我”的双簧快板和“老当益壮”的独幕剧；社会妇女还自编自演了“十年转变”的话剧；尽情地表达了他们的愉快心情。这对于巩固在服务和改造中既得的成绩和勉励他们继续前进有巨大的鼓舞作用。
    总之，我们感到“百件好事”活动，是发动社会人士为社会主义建设服务并通过服务加强改造的有效方式之一，它表明了：虽然社会人士年龄有大小，文化有高低，身体有强弱，只要政治挂帅，具有为社会主义服务的诚意，都可以对社会主义建设作出贡献。身体也从而得到锻炼，心情舒畅，精神愉快。
    我们正在根据已有的经验，围绕当前的中心工作更深入地把社会人士的“百件好事”活动进一步开展起来。并组织他们学习毛主席的著作，加强自我改造，帮助广大社会人士和我们一道，愉快地走上社会主义的康庄大道，积极为社会主义事业贡献力量。
    最后，谨祝大会成功，各位委员身体健康。
