Dear Chargé d'Affaires, dear Head and Members of the Hungarian-Chinese Friendship Association Delegation, Comrades, Friends:

    Today, on this glorious day when the Hungarian people are celebrating nationwide, representatives from all walks of life in our capital are gathering here to hold a grand rally to warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the Hungarian people. On behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese Government, and the Chinese people, I extend warm congratulations to the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, and the Hungarian people!

    Fifteen years ago, with the assistance of the Soviet army, the Hungarian people shattered the shackles of fascist enslavement and were liberated from the cruel rule of landlords and the bourgeoisie, ushering in a new era in Hungarian history. After liberation, under the leadership of the working class and its party, the Hungarian people, through sharp and complex struggles with domestic and foreign reactionaries, completed the democratic revolution, embarked on the broad road of socialism, and achieved brilliant successes in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    The great victory of the Hungarian people has made friends very happy, but it has aroused even greater hatred from the enemy. In October 1956, imperialism and domestic reactionaries in Hungary colluded to launch a counter-revolutionary rebellion, attempting to overthrow the revolutionary regime in Hungary and plunge the Hungarian people back into the abyss of capitalist suffering. However, contrary to the wishes of imperialism and domestic reactionaries in Hungary, the heroic Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kádár, and with the internationalist assistance of the Soviet army, quickly quelled the counter-revolutionary rebellion. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party held high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism and steadfastly led the Hungarian people to continue advancing bravely along the bright road of socialism. Today, the Hungarian party is stronger and more united than before, the dictatorship of the proletariat is more consolidated than before, the broad masses of the people are more closely united around the party, and the pace of socialist revolution and socialist construction is also faster. All this fully proves that the newborn socialist system has great vitality, and no decadent or reactionary force in the world can stop its victorious advance.

    Under the socialist system, Hungary's national economy is growing daily. The Hungarian Party and Government have implemented a policy of socialist industrialization, enabling Hungary's industry, especially heavy industry, to achieve rapid development. Now, Hungary's annual industrial output has reached about four times that of the pre-war year of 1938, and the output of major industrial products has increased several times or even dozens of times. The relatively weak machinery industry in the past has now occupied a major position in industry. Many large-scale new factories have been built in areas where industry was once backward. Many machines and factory equipment that could not be produced in the past can now be produced in large quantities not only to equip their own industry, but also to be exported in large quantities.

    In the past fifteen years, the face of Hungary's countryside has also undergone fundamental changes. In particular, in recent years, the Hungarian Party and Government have seized favorable opportunities and adopted correct policies to conduct extensive political and ideological education for farmers. The agricultural cooperation movement in Hungary has developed rapidly, with two successive upsurges since the spring of 1959. At present, over 70% of the townships in Hungary have implemented overall collectivization, and the socialist component of agriculture has accounted for more than 71% of the country's cultivated land. With the establishment and consolidation of new cooperatives, Hungary's agricultural production has increased significantly. In 1959, Hungary's total output of grain and feed grains increased by 26%-30% compared with 1958, and the average yield per unit area of wheat in cooperatives was 28% higher than that of individual farmers. All this shows the superiority of cooperation. The victory of the cooperative movement has not only opened up a broad road for the great development of Hungary's agricultural production, but also further strengthened Hungary's dictatorship of the proletariat and the worker-peasant alliance.

    While socialist economic construction is developing rapidly, Hungary's culture, art, and science have also seen unprecedented prosperity. Today's Hungary has completely eliminated illiteracy and has generally implemented eight-year compulsory education. The working people have become culturally new people. On the cultural and artistic front, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has adhered to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and waged resolute struggles against revisionism, nationalism, and all kinds of bourgeois ideology, achieving major victories. This struggle has consolidated the position of Marxism-Leninism in the cultural field and cleared the way for the smooth development of Hungary's socialist new culture.

    On the basis of these great achievements, the Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party held last December issued a new call to the people of the country to complete the foundation-laying work of socialism in the next few years and further accelerate socialist construction. The Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy adopted by the Congress has shown the Hungarian people an even more prosperous and happy future. Now, the Hungarian people are launching a surging labor competition upsurge to comprehensively and greatly over fulfill the Three-Year Plan and to create a higher starting point for the Second Five-Year Plan. We firmly believe that the great goals of the Hungarian people will be successfully realized.

    The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is a staunch fighter in the international communist movement. It has always been loyal to the cause of proletarian liberation and has led the Hungarian people in a resolute struggle against modern revisionism. Modern revisionism is the main danger of the international communist movement today. It is willing to act as a docile tool of imperialism, trying every possible means to undermine the international communist movement from within and disintegrate the socialist camp. The Hungarian people have a personal understanding of the dangers of modern revisionism. The Hungarian Party, together with the fraternal parties of various countries, smashed the destructive conspiracy of modern revisionism, defended Hungary's socialist system, and made a major contribution to safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism and maintaining the unity of the international communist movement and the unity of the socialist camp.

    The Hungarian Party and Government have consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, and together with the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world, resolutely oppose the imperialist policy of aggression and war, and defend world peace. U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of all countries and also of the Hungarian people. Comrade Kádár correctly pointed out in his report to the Seventh Congress of the Party: "International imperialism, headed by the American reactionary group, is the most powerful factor in the outbreak of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary. From the first day of Hungary's liberation, they have used all the tools they have to support all kinds of enemies of the Hungarian people." U.S. imperialism has not ceased interfering in Hungary's internal affairs even after the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary suffered a shameful defeat. U.S. imperialism has been launching slanders and attacks on the People's Republic of Hungary in the United Nations and other international organizations, and every year it stages a so-called "Hungarian question" farce at the United Nations conference. These despicable acts of U.S. imperialism can only further expose its aggressive face of hostility to socialism and hostility to the Hungarian people in front of the people of the world, and cannot affect the heroic Hungarian people's victorious advance along the broad road of socialism! Like the Hungarian people, the Chinese people have always struggled against the imperialist policy of war and for the maintenance of world peace. We are pleased to see that the current international situation has eased to some extent, which is the result of the persistent struggle of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people. The efforts made by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions have been warmly welcomed by the people of the world. The recent visit of Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, to France, and the efforts made by the Soviet Union at the recently held Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference between East and West, further demonstrated the sincerity of the Soviet government and the Soviet people for peace; to this, the Chinese people and the people of the world express firm support. However, it must be noted that the war forces headed by U.S. imperialism are not reconciled to the easing of the international situation. On the issue of disarmament, despite repeated concessions by the Soviet government, imperialism has still refused to change its position in the slightest. At the disarmament conference, they are fundamentally unwilling to touch on the issue of comprehensive and thorough disarmament, but instead emphasize so-called "supervision" in an attempt to use "supervision" to openly collect military intelligence from socialist countries. U.S. imperialism is not only unwilling to disarm, but is also actively expanding its armaments and preparing for war, stepping up the revival of West German and Japanese militarism, making West Germany and Japan two sources of serious war danger. Recently, Adenauer, after visiting the United States, also visited Japan and held talks with Nobusuke Kishi. West Germany and Japan, the two culprits who launched the world war, are once again colluding. All this shows that peace can never be easily achieved, and it must be maintained and consolidated through continuous and serious struggles. In the face of the current situation, the people of the world must heighten their vigilance, make persistent efforts, and make greater efforts to strive for further easing of the international situation and to defend world peace.

    The Chinese people have always given deep sympathy to the people of all countries who are striving for and defending national independence. At present, the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America are developing vigorously and deepening step by step. Millions of people oppressed and enslaved by imperialism are increasingly widely involved in the ranks of struggle, and are uniting more and more closely under the banner of opposing imperialism and striving for and defending national independence. The "Week of Support for the People of Latin America" and the upcoming Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference mark a further surge in the unity and anti-imperialist struggle of the people of Latin America and the people of Asia and Africa. Recently, the people of South Africa have also launched a mass struggle of enormous scale against racial discrimination and for basic human rights. The South African colonial authorities have even carried out barbaric massacres against unarmed African people. The Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the South African people and express great indignation and strong condemnation of this brutal crime by the South African authorities. We firmly believe that no matter what means imperialism adopts or what tricks it uses, it can never save its crumbling colonial rule. The Chinese people will always stand together with the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and with the people of the world, to fight to the end against our common enemy, imperialism.

    The Chinese people have consistently developed friendly and cooperative relations with Asian and African nationalist countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit. Not long ago, our country signed agreements with Burma and Nepal successively on the border issues between the two countries, signed a treaty of friendship and non-aggression with Burma, and signed an economic aid agreement with Nepal. The signing of these agreements fully demonstrates the great vitality of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, sets a good example for the friendly unity of Asian and African countries, and powerfully exposes various rumors and slanders by imperialism. We believe that among Asian and African countries, as long as they act on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, there is no problem that cannot be reasonably resolved through peaceful consultation. The imperialist conspiracy to create disputes and undermine unity between our country and some Asian countries will be completely bankrupt, and the friendship between the people of our country and the people of these countries will continue to be consolidated and developed.

    The people of China and Hungary have cared for and supported each other in the long-term revolutionary struggle, and our friendship is as long-standing as the Yangtze and Danube rivers. Since the people of the two countries were liberated, this traditional friendship of proletarian internationalism has been rapidly carried forward in the new historical conditions, and the friendly cooperation between the two countries has been fully and deeply developed. The Chinese people cherish and thank the Hungarian people for the friendly support and assistance they have given to our people in this friendly cooperation. We are deeply honored that Comrades Kádár, Münnich, and Dobi have all visited our country successively, expressing the fraternal friendship of the Hungarian people. Our Comrades Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and Tan Zhenlin have also personally brought the sincere fraternal friendship of the Chinese people to the Hungarian people. The people of our two countries are united in international affairs and have made significant contributions to maintaining world peace and promoting the cause of human progress. Our close cooperation in economic and cultural fields has effectively promoted the common upsurge of socialist construction in the two countries. Last May, our two countries signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation, fixing the deep friendship between the two peoples in the form of a treaty. The continuous consolidation and development of the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Hungary is not only conducive to the socialist construction of the two countries, but also to the entire socialist camp and world peace.

    Comrades, friends! In the past fifteen years, the People's Republic of Hungary has undergone tremendous and profound changes. As we celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the Hungarian people, we are overjoyed at the victories that the Hungarian people have already won. We wish the Hungarian people new and even more brilliant victories in the noble cause of building socialism and defending world peace!

    Long live the People's Republic of Hungary!
    Long live the leadership of the Hungarian people—the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party!
    Long live the eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Hungary!
    Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live world peace!

    中匈友谊像长江和多瑙河一样源远流长
    陈毅副总理在首都庆祝匈牙利人民解放十五周年大会上的讲话亲爱的临时代办同志，亲爱的匈中友协代表团团长同志和团员同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，在匈牙利人民举国欢腾的光辉日子里，我们首都各界代表在这里举行盛大集会，隆重庆祝匈牙利人民解放十五周年。我谨代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民向匈牙利社会主义工人党、匈牙利工农革命政府和匈牙利人民致以热烈的祝贺！
    十五年前，匈牙利人民在苏联军队的援助下，粉碎了法西斯奴役的枷锁，从大地主和资产阶级的残酷统治下获得了解放，为匈牙利的历史开创了一个新的纪元。解放后的匈牙利人民，在工人阶级及其政党的领导下，经过同国内外反动派的尖锐复杂的斗争，完成了民主革命，走上了社会主义的康庄大道，并且在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中取得了辉煌的成就。
    匈牙利人民的伟大胜利，使朋友感到十分高兴，但却引起敌人更大的仇恨。1956年10月，帝国主义和匈牙利国内的反动派勾结起来发动了反革命叛乱，妄图颠复匈牙利的革命政权，把匈牙利人民重新投入资本主义的苦难深渊。但是，同帝国主义和匈牙利国内反动派的愿望恰恰相反，英勇的匈牙利人民在以卡达尔同志为首的匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导下，在苏联军队的国际主义援助下，迅速平定了反革命叛乱。在反革命叛乱平定后，匈牙利社会主义工人党更高地举起了马克思列宁主义的红旗，坚定地领导着匈牙利人民继续沿着社会主义的光明大道奋勇前进。今天，匈牙利的党比以前更加坚强、更加团结了，无产阶级专政比以前更加巩固了，广大人民在党的周围团结得更加紧密了，社会主义革命和社会主义建设的前进步伐也更加迅速了。这一切充分证明了，新生的社会主义制度具有伟大的生命力，世界上一切腐朽、反动的力量都阻挡不了它的胜利前进。
    在社会主义制度下，匈牙利的国民经济日益高涨。匈牙利的党和政府实行了社会主义工业化的方针，使匈牙利的工业，首先是重工业获得了迅速的发展。现在，匈牙利工业的年产量已经达到战前1938年的四倍左右，主要工业产品的产量都有了成倍的甚至几十倍的增长。过去比较薄弱的机械工业，已经在工业中占据了主要的地位。过去工业落后的地区已经盖起了许多规模巨大的新工厂。过去不能生产的许多机器和工厂设备，现在不仅能够大批生产来装备自己的工业，而且还能够大量出口。
    十五年来，匈牙利的农村面貌也发生了根本性的变化。特别是最近几年，匈牙利的党和政府抓住了有利的时机，采取了正确的政策，对农民进行了广泛的政治思想教育，匈牙利的农业合作化运动得到了迅速的发展，从1959年春季起，连续出现了两次高潮。目前，匈牙利全国已有70％以上的乡镇实行了全盘合作化，农业的社会主义成分已经占全国耕地面积的71％以上。随着新的合作社的建立和巩固，匈牙利的农业生产有了显著的增长。1959年匈牙利的粮食和饲料谷物的总产量比1958年增加了26％—30％，合作社的小麦单位面积产量平均比个体农民高28％。这一切，都显示了合作化的优越性。合作化运动的胜利，不仅为匈牙利农业生产的大发展开辟了宽广的道路，而且进一步加强了匈牙利的无产阶级专政和工农联盟。
    在社会主义经济建设迅速发展的同时，匈牙利的文化、艺术和科学也出现了空前的繁荣景象。今天的匈牙利已经完全扫除了文盲，而且普遍实行了八年制的义务教育，劳动人民已成了有文化的新人。在文化艺术战线上，匈牙利社会主义工人党坚持马克思列宁主义的原则，对修正主义、民族主义和形形色色的资产阶级思想，进行了坚决的斗争，取得了重大的胜利。这场斗争巩固了马克思列宁主义在文化领域内的阵地，为匈牙利社会主义新文化的顺利发展廓清了道路。
    在这些伟大成就的基础上，去年12月召开的匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会又向全国人民发出了新的战斗号召，要在最近几年内完成社会主义的奠基工作，进一步加速社会主义的建设。大会通过的关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划，为匈牙利人民展示了更加繁荣和幸福的远景。现在，匈牙利人民正掀起一个汹涌澎湃的劳动竞赛高潮，为全面地、更大地超额完成三年计划，和为第二个五年计划创造更高的起点而斗争，我们深信，匈牙利人民的伟大目标一定会顺利实现。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党是国际共产主义运动的坚强战士，它始终忠于无产阶级的解放事业，领导匈牙利人民同现代修正主义进行了坚决的斗争。现代修正主义是国际共产主义运动当前的主要危险。它甘心充当帝国主义的驯服工具，千方百计地从内部来破坏国际共产主义运动，瓦解社会主义阵营。匈牙利人民对现代修正主义的危害有着切身的体会。匈牙利的党同各国兄弟党一道粉碎了现代修正主义的破坏阴谋，保卫了匈牙利的社会主义制度，对捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，对维护国际共产主义运动的团结和社会主义阵营的团结作出了重大的贡献。
    匈牙利党和政府一贯奉行和平外交政策，同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，坚决反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫世界和平。美帝国主义是各国人民也是匈牙利人民的最凶恶的敌人。卡达尔同志在党的第七次代表大会的报告中正确地指出：“以美国反动集团为首的国际帝国主义是匈牙利爆发反革命叛乱的最有力的因素。从匈牙利解放的第一天起，他们就利用自己拥有的一切工具，支持匈牙利人民的形形色色的敌人。”美帝国主义在匈牙利反革命叛乱遭到可耻的失败以后，仍然没有停止过对匈牙利内政的干涉。美帝国主义一直在联合国和其他国际组织内发动对匈牙利人民共和国的诬蔑和攻击，并且每年都要在联合国会议上演一出所谓“匈牙利问题”的丑剧。美帝国主义的这些卑劣行径，只能在全世界人民面前更加暴露出它敌视社会主义、敌视匈牙利人民的侵略面目，丝毫也不能影响英勇的匈牙利人民沿着社会主义的康庄大道胜利前进！中国人民和匈牙利人民一样，一贯为反对帝国主义的战争政策，维护世界和平而斗争。我们高兴地看到，目前国际形势有了一定的缓和，这是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和爱好和平的人民进行了坚持不懈斗争的结果。苏联为缓和国际紧张局势所作的努力，得到了全世界人民的热烈欢迎。最近苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志对法国的访问，和苏联在最近召开的东西方十国裁军会议上所作的努力，进一步表现了苏联政府和苏联人民对于和平的诚意；对此，中国人民和全世界人民表示坚决的支持。但是，不能不看到，以美帝国主义为首的战争势力是不甘心于国际局势的缓和的。在裁军问题上，尽管苏联政府一再作出让步，帝国主义仍然丝毫不肯改变他们的立场。他们在裁军会议上，根本不肯触及全面彻底裁军的问题，而一味强调所谓“监督”，企图利用“监督”来公开搜集社会主义国家的军事情报。美帝国主义不仅不肯裁军，而且还在积极扩军备战，加紧复活西德日本军国主义，使西德和日本成为两个严重战争危险的策源地。最近，阿登纳在访问了美国以后，又访问了日本，同岸信介进行了会谈。西德和日本这两个发动过世界大战的祸首又在重新勾结。所有这一切都表明，和平决不是可以轻易取得的，必须经过不断的、严重的斗争，和平才能够维护和巩固。面对着目前的情况，全世界人民必须提高警惕，再接再厉，为争取国际局势的进一步缓和，为保卫世界和平而作出更大的努力。
    中国人民对于正在争取和维护民族独立的各国人民一向给予深切的同情。目前，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动正在蓬勃发展和步步深入。千百万受帝国主义压迫和奴役的人民日益广泛地投入斗争的行列，并且在反对帝国主义、争取和维护民族独立的旗帜下团结得越来越紧密。“支援拉丁美洲人民周”和即将召开的第二届亚非人民团结大会，标志着拉丁美洲人民和亚非人民的团结和反帝斗争的进一步高涨。最近，南非人民也掀起了规模巨大的反对种族歧视和争取基本人权的群众性斗争。南非殖民当局竟然对手无寸铁的非洲人民进行了野蛮的屠杀，中国人民完全支持南非人民的正义斗争，对南非当局的这种残暴罪行表示莫大的愤慨和强烈的谴责。我们深信，不管帝国主义采取什么手段，施展什么伎俩，都决不能挽救他们摇摇欲坠的殖民统治。中国人民将永远同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民一道，同世界人民一道，为反对我们的共同敌人帝国主义而斗争到底。
    中国人民一贯本着和平共处五项原则和万隆精神发展同亚非民族主义国家的友好合作关系。不久以前，我国同缅甸、尼泊尔先后签订了关于两国边界问题的协定，同缅甸签订了友好和互不侵犯条约，同尼泊尔签订了两国经济援助协定。这些协定的签订充分显示出和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的伟大生命力，为亚非国家友好团结树立了良好的榜样，并且有力地揭穿了帝国主义的各种造谣诬蔑。我们认为，在亚非国家间，只要彼此都本着和平共处五项原则和万隆精神办事，就没有任何问题不可以通过和平协商求得合理的解决。帝国主义在我国同某些亚洲国家间制造纠纷、破坏团结的阴谋必将彻底破产，我国人民同这些国家人民的友谊必将继续获得不断的巩固和发展。
    中匈两国人民在长期的革命斗争中互相关怀、互相支持，我们之间的友谊像长江和多瑙河一样源远流长。自从两国人民各自获得解放以后，这种无产阶级国际主义的传统友谊在新的历史条件下迅速地发扬光大，两国的友好合作有了全面和深入的发展。中国人民十分珍视和感谢匈牙利人民在这种友好合作中给予我国人民的友好支持和援助。我们深以为荣的是，卡达尔同志、明尼赫同志和道比同志都先后访问过我国，表达了匈牙利人民的兄弟友谊。我们的朱德同志、周恩来同志和谭震林同志也曾亲自把中国人民的诚挚的兄弟情谊带给了匈牙利人民。我们两国人民在国际事务中团结一致，为维护世界和平和促进人类进步事业做出了重大贡献。我们在经济和文化方面的紧密合作，有效地促进了两国社会主义建设事业的共同高涨。去年5月，我们两国签订了友好合作条约，把两国人民的深厚友谊用条约的形式固定了下来。中匈两国友好合作关系的不断巩固和发展，不仅有利于两国的社会主义建设，而且有利于整个社会主义阵营和世界和平。
    同志们，朋友们！在过去的十五年中，匈牙利人民共和国发生了巨大和深刻的变化。在我们欢庆匈牙利人民解放十五周年的时候，我们为匈牙利人民已经赢得的胜利感到欢欣鼓舞。我们祝匈牙利人民在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的崇高事业中赢得新的更加辉煌的胜利！
    匈牙利人民共和国万岁！
    匈牙利人民的领导力量——匈牙利社会主义工人党万岁！
    中匈两国人民永恒的牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
