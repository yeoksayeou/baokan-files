Grasp Technical Transformation of Small-Scale Furnaces Vigorously
Sichuan's Pig Iron Daily Output Rises at High Speed
The Provincial Party Committee Calls on All Workers in the Province to Work Together to Ensure the Province's Daily Pig Iron Output is Consolidated Above 10,000 Tons, and Strive for Further Improvement; Immediately Launch a Steel-Seizing Campaign to Lay the Foundation for Completing the Second Quarter Plan Ahead of Schedule and Exceeding the Target

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 25th: Sichuan Province's pig iron production has seen a new situation of large-scale bumper harvests. Since April 6th, the province's pig iron output has been advancing at a high speed of more than 600 tons per day. By the 18th, the daily pig iron output had exceeded 10,000 tons. At present, Leshan, Mianyang, and Daxian three regions have become regions with a daily output of more than 1,000 tons. There are already 100 high-yield small blast furnaces with an average utilization coefficient of over 2 in the province.

Sichuan's small-scale iron smelting furnaces are responsible for more than 90% of the province's pig iron production this year. At the beginning of the year, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee put forward the call to vigorously grasp the improvement of small-scale furnaces and achieve a better overall leap forward. It successively held on-site meetings of small-scale iron smelting furnaces in Yibin and Leshan to comprehensively and systematically exchange advanced technical experience in smelting. This enabled workers on the iron smelting front to further find experience in improving small-scale furnaces, and powerfully accelerated the technical transformation of small-scale furnaces. In the competition movement where workers on the iron smelting front were catching up with each other, the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces was continuously improved. After the Yuejin small blast furnace of Wanfu Iron and Steel Plant and the Huojian small blast furnace of Chongqing County Huaiyuan Iron Plant created new records for utilization coefficient, the workers of Qianghua Iron and Steel Plant immediately caught up, making the utilization coefficient of the No. 28 small blast furnace exceed that of Yuejin. Upon hearing the news, the workers of Yuejin were determined to catch up with the Qianghua Plant. They overcame numerous difficulties and created even higher records, continuing to lead the province.

In the work of concentrating on improving the pig iron production of small-scale furnaces, the local Party committees conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, went deep into the front line, vigorously grasped the weak links with the idea of active balance, and continuously put forward new goals, encouraged enthusiasm, and added measures, so that the development of the movement was higher than the other. The continuous development of small-scale iron smelting furnaces has also put forward new requirements for machine repair strength and building materials. In order to ensure the maintenance and repair of small-scale furnace equipment and the needs of basic construction, many small-scale furnace iron smelting plants have now begun to engage in diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, so that these small enterprises have gradually developed into joint enterprises with blast furnaces, mines, coal coking, machine repair, slag cement, and coking for oil extraction.

The workers on the iron smelting front in the province are currently advancing victoriously, consolidating their results, continuing to improve, and determined to create greater and newer achievements in late April to welcome the "May 1st" International Labor Day.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 25th: The Sichuan Provincial Party Committee called on the workers on the industrial and transportation fronts of the province to take advantage of the excellent situation and launch a steel-seizing campaign to rapidly improve the level of steel production in late April; and use steel as the key link to further drive the overall growth of various industrial productions.

Since entering April, Sichuan Province's pig iron production has been rising day by day, and it has exceeded 10,000 tons on the 18th. The quality is also gradually rising. This situation is extremely favorable for rapidly improving the level of steel production. The Provincial Party Committee believes that it is necessary to seize the current favorable situation, take resolute measures, organize the strength of all parties, concentrate on increasing steel production, so as to ensure the over-fulfillment of this year's national steel plan and ensure the needs of national key construction and support for agricultural technical transformation.

The Provincial Party Committee called on all localities to fully carry forward the spirit of communist collaboration, take steel as the key link, vigorously grasp the production and transfer of pig iron and coal coke, and work together to ensure the rapid improvement of the level of steel production. First of all, it is necessary to grasp pig iron production to ensure that the province's pig iron output is consolidated above 10,000 tons, and strive for further improvement. At the same time, all localities should transfer more good iron to support steelmaking. The coal production departments should not only produce more coal coke to ensure steel production, but also adapt to the requirements of taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward, and vigorously improve the coal supply of various industrial departments. The Provincial Party Committee requires that in grasping steelmaking production, all localities must take the high yield of steelmaking furnaces as the "leader", vigorously grasp the production of iron melting furnaces, raw materials and auxiliary materials, and transportation inside and outside the factory, so as to achieve "six complete sets, transportation into a network" of blast furnaces, mines, coal coke, machine repair, slag cement, and coking. To this end, all localities must promptly arrange the supply of pig iron, coal coke and other raw materials to small steel plants. Where to supply, how much to supply, should be specified in a concrete plan, aligned, to ensure that each link is tightly linked, step by step implementation, and accurately complete the production tasks.

The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that whether the output of steel can rapidly leap forward depends on strengthening the leadership of the Party. In all places with steel plants, the local Party committees and municipal Party committees should immediately send capable cadres to go deep into the steel plants to strengthen leadership. All steel plants should also adopt the method of fighting on two fronts, transfer the main responsible cadres to go deep into the front line of production, eat, live, and labor with the workers, and jointly solve the problems in production; at the same time, fully mobilize the masses, set off a competition upsurge of advanced being more advanced and backward catching up with the advanced, promote the rapid improvement of production, and lay the foundation for completing the second quarter plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

    狠狠抓住小洋群的技术改造
    四川生铁日产量高速度上升
    省委号召全省职工同心协力保证全省生铁日产量巩固在万吨以上，力争进一步提高；立即开展一个夺钢战役，为提前超额完成第二季度计划打下基础
    新华社成都25日电　四川省生铁生产出现了大面积丰收的新局面。从4月6日起，全省生铁产量就以日增六百多吨的高速度向前跃进，到18日，生铁日产量已经突破万吨。目前，全省已有乐山、绵阳、达县三个专区，成为日产千吨以上的专区。利用系数平均达到二以上的高产小高炉，全省已有一百座。
    四川省的炼铁小洋群，今年担负了全省生铁生产任务的90％以上。年初一开始，中共四川省委就提出了狠狠抓住提高小洋群，实现更好的全面跃进的号召，并且在宜宾、乐山先后召开了全省炼铁小洋群现场会议，全面系统地交流了冶炼先进技术经验，使炼铁战线职工进一步找到了提高小洋群的经验，有力地加速了小洋群的技术改造。全省炼铁职工在你追我赶的竞赛运动中，不断地提高了小高炉的利用系数。在万福钢铁厂跃进号小高炉和崇庆县怀远铁厂火箭号小高炉分别创造利用系数新纪录以后，强华钢铁厂职工马上急起直追，使二十八号小高炉的利用系数超过了跃进号。跃进号职工闻讯以后，决心追赶强华厂，他们战胜重重困难，又创造了更高的纪录，继续在全省领先。
    在突击提高小洋群炼铁生产的工作中，各地党委都认真贯彻了省委的指示，深入第一线，用积极平衡的思想狠抓薄弱环节，不断提出新的奋斗目标，鼓干劲，添措施，使运动的发展一浪高过一浪。炼铁小洋群的不断发展，对机修力量、建筑材料等也提出了新的要求。为了保证小洋群设备的维护检修和基本建设的需要，现在有不少小洋群炼铁厂开始大搞多种经营，大搞综合利用，使这些小型企业逐步发展成为有高炉、矿山、煤焦、机修、矿渣水泥、炼焦取油的联合企业。
    全省炼铁战线职工，目前正在乘胜前进，巩固战果，继续提高，决心在4月下旬创造更大更新的成绩，迎接“五一”国际劳动节。
    新华社成都25日电　中共四川省委号召全省工业交通战线职工乘大好形势，开展一个夺钢战役，在4月下旬把钢的生产水平迅速提高一步；并且以钢为纲，进一步带动各项工业生产全面增长。
    四川省的生铁生产自进入4月以来，日日上升，18日已突破万吨，质量也在逐步上升。这一形势对于迅速提高钢的生产水平极为有利。省委认为必须抓住当前有利形势，采取坚决措施，把各方面的力量组织起来，突击增加钢的生产，以保证超额完成今年钢的国家计划，保证国家重点建设和支援农业技术改造的需要。
    省委号召各地充分发扬共产主义大协作的精神，以钢为纲，大抓生铁、煤焦生产和调运，同心协力保证迅速提高钢的生产水平。首先要抓紧生铁生产，保证全省生铁产量巩固在万吨以上，并力争进一步提高。同时，各地要多调好铁，支援炼钢。煤炭生产部门不仅要多产煤焦，确保钢铁生产，而且要适应以钢为纲、全面跃进的要求，大力改善各工业部门的煤炭供应。省委要求各地在抓炼钢生产当中，必须以炼钢炉的高产为“龙头”，大抓化铁炉、原料和辅助材料的生产和厂内外的运输，做到高炉、矿山、煤焦、机修、矿渣水泥、炼焦“六群成套，运输成网”。为此，各地都要及时安排小钢厂的生铁、煤焦和其他原料材料的供应。由哪里供应，供应多少，要订出具体计划，对起口来，保证环环扣紧，步步落实，准确完成生产任务。
    省委指出，钢的产量能否迅速飞跃增长，关键在于加强党的领导。凡是有钢厂的地方，地委市委都应立即派出得力干部深入钢厂加强领导。各钢厂也要采取两线作战的方法，调主要负责干部深入生产第一线，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，共同解决生产中的问题；同时要充分发动群众，掀起先进更先进、落后追先进的竞赛热潮，推动生产迅速提高，为提前超额完成第二季度计划打下基础。（附图片）
