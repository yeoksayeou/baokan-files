Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, April 23rd: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has carried out a health campaign focused on eliminating diseases and pests, greatly reducing various illnesses. Among the various ethnic minorities, a picture of "longevity and prosperity" is emerging. To date, the Mongolian population in the autonomous region has increased from over 830,000 when the autonomous region was established in 1947 to over 1.17 million, a 41% increase in thirteen years. The populations of the Manchu, Hui, Korean, Daur, Ewenki, and Oroqen ethnic minorities within the autonomous region have also increased by more than 80%. The situation of continuous population decline among various ethnic minorities for many years has been completely reversed.

Since the establishment of the autonomous region, Party organizations at all levels in Inner Mongolia have consistently regarded the health campaign centered on eliminating diseases and pests as an important task for promoting the prosperity of the populations of various ethnic minorities. Regarding the plague, which was severely prevalent in the old society, the Party led the people of all ethnic groups to eradicate the plague bacteria in a very short period of time, even when economic conditions were still very difficult in the early days of the autonomous region's establishment. Subsequently, mass rat extermination campaigns were carried out year after year. Currently, thousands of rat-free towns and villages have emerged. In pastoral and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, work has also been carried out to prevent and control venereal diseases, providing free treatment to people of all ethnic minorities. In 1959, this disease was basically eliminated throughout the region. In recent years, effective prevention and control measures have also been taken against brucellosis, which endangers the health of humans and livestock. A total of more than 300,000 people have been examined throughout the region, and more than 20,000 patients have been treated. Diseases such as puerperal fever and neonatal tetanus, which threatened the lives of mothers and children in the past, have now been eradicated in many areas. All of this has contributed to the annual increase in the populations of various ethnic minorities.

During the health campaign to eliminate diseases and pests, the mental outlook of various ethnic minorities has also undergone tremendous changes. Superstitious ideas that women were not allowed to give birth indoors for fear of polluting the "Buddha" and that people dared not harm the four pests or clean up manure heaps for many years have been broken. Conditions for maternal and child health care have been completely changed. Herdsmen have generally developed good habits such as frequently washing and changing clothes and wiping the "hana" (the frame supporting the yurt) of their yurts. Recently, in the campaign to eliminate the four pests and improve environmental sanitation, many people's communes and production teams in pastoral areas have achieved the goal of having toilets for people, pens for livestock and poultry, toothbrushes and towels for everyone, and spittoons for every household.

The health campaign centered on eliminating diseases and pests has promoted the great development of the autonomous region's health cause. At present, in addition to establishing two higher medical colleges in the region, secondary medical professional schools have also been established in each league and city. In recent years, these colleges have trained more than 26,000 medical and health technicians from all ethnic groups, including more than 8,300 senior Chinese and Western medical and health technicians. Hospitals, health centers, and health clinics have been established throughout the region from the banner and county levels to the people's communes and many production teams. The number of existing hospital beds in the region has increased more than forty times compared to when the autonomous region was established. There are a total of more than 1,200 medical and health stations, epidemic prevention, and maternal and child health care institutions scattered in rural and pastoral areas, forming a strong medical and health care network. In addition, the region has vigorously transformed old midwives, trained new maternal and child health workers and midwives, and actively carried out new methods of delivery and new methods of childcare. At present, the average rate of new-style delivery in the region has reached more than 90%, which has greatly reduced the mortality rate of newborns, ensuring the prosperity of the populations of various ethnic minorities and the great development of various industrial, agricultural, and pastoral productions.

    少数民族人口兴旺　工农牧业生产发展
    内蒙古除病灭害成绩巨大
    据新华社呼和浩特23日电　内蒙古自治区开展除病灭害卫生运动，各种疾病大大减少，在各少数民族中，呈现出一幅“人寿年丰”的大好景象。到目前，自治区蒙古族人口已由1947年自治区成立时的八十三万多人上升到一百一十七万多人，十三年中增长41％；自治区境内的满、回、朝鲜、达斡尔、鄂温克和鄂伦春等少数民族人口也增长了80％以上。多少年来各少数民族人口连年下降的局面已经彻底改变。
    内蒙古各级党组织，在自治区成立后，一直把除病灭害为中心的卫生运动，作为繁荣各少数民族人口的一项重要工作。对于旧社会严重流行的鼠疫，在自治区成立初期经济条件还很困难的情况下，党即领导各族人民在很短时间内就扑灭了鼠疫细菌，以后又连年开展了群众性灭鼠运动。目前已出现了几千个无鼠城镇和村庄。在牧区和半农半牧区，还开展了防治性病的工作，对各少数民族人民实行免费治疗，在1959年全区基本消灭了这种疾病。几年来，对危害人畜健康的布氏杆菌病，也进行了有力的防治，全区共检查了三十多万人，治疗了两万多名患者。过去威胁母子生命的产褥热和新生儿破伤风等疾病，现在不少地区已经根除。这一切都促使各少数民族人口逐年上升。
    在除病灭害卫生运动中，各少数民族的精神面貌也发生了巨大变化。多少年来怕染污“佛爷”而不许妇女在室内生产，不敢损伤四害和清理粪堆等迷信思想已经破除，妇幼保健条件已完全改变。牧民们普遍养成了经常洗换衣服，擦洗蒙古包“哈那”（支蒙古包的架子）等良好习惯。最近在大除四害和搞好环境卫生的运动中，不少牧区人民公社和生产队，已做到了人有厕所、畜禽有圈窝、人人有牙刷、手巾，家家有痰盂。
    以除病灭害为中心的卫生运动，推动了自治区卫生事业的大发展。目前，全区除已建立两所高等医药院校外，在各盟、市也都建立了中等医药专业学校，几年来，这些院校已培育各民族医药卫生技术人员两万六千多人，其中中西医高级卫生技术人员就有八千三百多人。全区从旗、县到人民公社和许多生产队，还建立了医院、卫生院和卫生所，全区现有的病床比自治区成立时增加四十多倍。遍布在农村、牧区的医疗保健站卫生防疫和妇幼保健机构共达一千二百多处，形成了一个强大的医疗保健网。此外，全区还大力改造旧产婆，培训新的妇幼保健员和接生员，积极开展了新法接生和新法育儿工作。现在，全区新法接生率平均达到90％以上，这就大大减少了新生婴儿的死亡，保证了各少数民族人口兴旺和工、农、牧业各项生产的大发展。
