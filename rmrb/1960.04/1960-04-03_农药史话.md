    A Brief History of Pesticides
    Yang Min

    The history of pesticides in China dates back at least two thousand years. According to records in "Zhou Li" and "Qiu Guan": "The Shushi is in charge of eliminating poisons and using...fine herbs to attack them. The Jian Shi is in charge of eliminating pests and using...mang grass to fumigate them...The Chi Ba Shi is in charge of eliminating pests from walls and houses, using clam charcoal to attack them, and sprinkling ashes to poison them, and eliminating woodlice from all crevices. The Guo Shi is in charge of removing frogs and toads, burning male...? and sprinkling ashes to kill them, and using the smoke to cover them, so that all aquatic pests are silent." From this, it can be seen that the insecticides and sterilizers used at that time already included two major categories: "plants" and "inorganic substances" made by calcining animals, and the methods of use also included "contact killing" and "fumigation." The establishment of special officials and the meticulous division of labor indicate that people at that time had already widely promoted and paid great attention to the work of preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests.

    The use of drugs for insect prevention and sterilization treatment of seeds was invented no later than the Han Dynasty. Wang Chong of the Later Han Dynasty said in the "Shang Chong" chapter of "Lun Heng": "The methods of storing seeds by Shennong and Houji involved boiling horse manure to make juice to soak the seeds, so that the crops would not be infested with insects." China's earliest agricultural book, "Fan Shengzhi Shu," has more specific and detailed records in this regard. One passage says: Take one dan of horse bones, crush them, add three dan of water, boil three times, filter out the residue, and use the boiled solution to soak five Aconitum tubers. After three or four days, remove the Aconitum tubers and soak in equal amounts of silkworm feces and sheep feces, and mix into a thick liquid. Twenty days before sowing, use this thick liquid to soak the seeds, and after they are dry, soak them several times to make the seeds look like wheat rice. In this way, the crops will not attract locusts and other pests. A few years ago, the agricultural department conducted experiments according to this method and proved that it did have a fairly good effect.

    Among inorganic insecticides, arsenic, which is most widely used, was already being used in large quantities for seed dressing in China no later than the Ming Dynasty. In the "Mai Gong" section of "Tiangong Kaiwu" written by Song Yingxing of the Ming Dynasty, it is said: "In Shaanxi and Henan, those who worry about insect damage sometimes mix arsenic with seeds. In the south, only burnt ash (commonly known as earth ash) is used."

    There are even more references to drugs used for insect removal in warehouses in historical documents. "Guo Tuotuo's Book on Planting Trees" records the method of storing wheat: "It is advisable to harvest it in the hot sun, while it is still hot, and mix crushed Xanthium sibiricum leaves or hemp leaves in it to prevent it from turning into moths."

    In addition, in the Later Wei Dynasty more than 1,400 years ago, Veratrum was used to wash and treat sheep scabies; Su Dongpo's "Record of Mutual Induction of Things" already had records of using oils, sulfur, pine needles, and shepherd's purse flowers to prevent rice weevils, moths, and mosquitoes... and overseas Chinese vegetable farmers living in Malaya using derris—one of the best plant insecticides—as an insecticide; all of these were the earliest inventions in the world.

    The above are "indigenous pesticides." "Foreign pesticides" generally refer to inorganic or organic insecticides, sterilizers, herbicides, and growth stimulants made by chemical methods. What is most valued in foreign pesticides are organic synthetic preparations. Among their ancestors, the most historically significant are benzene hexachloride (BHC), discovered by Faraday in 1852, and DDT, discovered by Zidler, a student at the University of Strasbourg in Germany, nearly a century ago. However, these two good insecticides were not given due attention at the time. Some papers reporting its insecticidal effect were not published until 1935. It was not until after 1946 that countries around the world began to promote its use. The latter was also widely used more than sixty years later.

    The reason why BHC and DDT are the most historically significant is first of all because they have strong insecticidal power, a wide range of insects killed, and are less toxic to humans, animals, and crops... But more importantly, it is because they set a good example and quickly led to the invention of many more effective insecticides and sterilizers. Such as 1605, 1059 and other "organophosphorus insecticides" characterized by containing phosphorus, as well as various products characterized by containing fluorine, mercury, sulfur, etc., which were produced immediately after their discovery.

    In recent years, due to the joint research of Soviet biologists and chemists, many pesticides with high performance have been obtained, which can arbitrarily promote, inhibit or stop plant growth. In addition, there are agents that prevent potatoes, sugar beets, and onions from sprouting during storage, agents that increase the flowering rate of cotton, as well as defoliants that kill weeds and remove leaves for harvesting, and rooting agents that promote rooting and facilitate transplantation.

    Since liberation, China's pesticide research and production have developed vigorously. In 1952, several important organic insecticides such as DDT, BHC, and 1605 were manufactured. Now BHC's output has jumped to the first place in the world. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, pesticide production has also leaped forward rapidly. The highly effective and inexpensive inorganic systemic insecticide "Agricultural Calcium Aminosulfonate," "Dinitrothiocyanobenzene," which can replace Bordeaux mixture and prevent wheat scab and rust, "Pentachloronitrobenzene," which prevents cotton seedling anthracnose and damping-off, and the organophosphorus insecticide "Ethyl Marathon," which has efficacy comparable to 1605 but is less toxic to humans and animals, have all been successfully trial-produced and put into production. In addition, the famous "2,4-D" and "Sodium Naphthalene Acetate" and other plant growth stimulants have also been produced. The development of indigenous pesticides has been even faster. More than 500 varieties were discovered during the Great Leap Forward, and more than 2.4 million indigenous pesticide factories were established across the country, using more than 17 million tons of pesticides. Ten relevant units of the Central Government have also jointly formed the "Indigenous Pesticide Scientific Research Office" to guide indigenous pesticide production. In the field of pesticides, we are carrying forward the rich heritage accumulated by the ancient working people.

    农药史话
    杨旻
    农药在我国最短也有两千多年的历史了。据“周礼”“秋官”记载：“庶氏掌除毒蛊，以……嘉草攻之。翦氏掌除蠹物，以……莽草熏之……赤犮氏掌除墙屋，以蜃炭攻之，以灰洒毒之，凡隙屋除其狸虫。蝈氏掌去鼃黽，焚牡?，以灰洒之则死，以其烟被之则凡水蛊无声。”从这里可以看到当时应用的杀虫灭菌药，已有“植物”和利用动物煆烧而成的“无机物”两大类了，使用的方法也有“触杀”和“熏蒸”之分了。而专官的设置，分工的细致，又说明了当时的人们对于防治病虫害的工作，早已普遍推行和十分注意了。
    用药物进行种子的防虫杀菌处理，至迟也是在汉代就发明了的。后汉王充“论衡”的“商虫”篇说：“神农后稷藏种之方，煮马屎以汁渍种者，令禾不虫。”我国最早的一部农书——“泛胜之书”，在这方面有更具体而详细的记载，其中有一段说：取马骨一石挫碎，加三石水，煮三沸，滤去渣，用煮成的溶液浸附子五枚，三四天后，去附子，再浸入等量的蚕矢和羊矢，和成稠液，在下种前二十天，用这稠液溲种子，干后再溲数次，使种子如麦饭状。这样，庄稼就不会惹蝗虫和其他害虫。前几年农业部门曾按法进行试验，证明确有相当好的效果。
    无机杀虫剂中应用最广泛的砒霜，在我国至迟在明代就已经大量地用于拌种了。明宋应星所著“天工开物”中“麦工”一项中说：“陕洛之间，忧虫蚀者，或以砒霜拌种子，南方所用，惟炊烬（俗名地灰）也。”
    对于仓库除虫用的药物，历代文献中提到的更多。“郭橐驼种树书”记载收藏麦子的方法说：“宜烈日之中，乘热而收，仍用苍耳叶或麻叶碎杂其中，则免化蛾。”
    此外，如一千四百多年前的后魏时代已利用藜芦洗治羊疥虫；苏东坡的“物类相感志”上早就有用油类、硫黄和松毛、荠菜花等防治米虫、飞蛾及蚊虫……的记载。以及旅居马来亚的华侨菜农用鱼藤——最好的植物杀虫药之一——作杀虫药；也都是世界上最先的发明创造。
    上面提到的是“土农药”。至于“洋农药”，一般是指用化学方法制成的无机或有机杀虫灭菌剂、除莠剂、生长刺激剂等而言。洋农药最被人看重的是有机合成制剂。在它们的始祖中，最有历史意义的便是法拉第在1852年发现的六六六和德国斯特拉斯堡大学的学生齐德勒在近一百年前发现的滴滴涕。然而这两种杀虫良药，当时并没有受到应有的重视，前者一直到了1935年才发表了一些报道它的杀虫作用的论文。到1946年后，世界各国才开始推广使用。后者也过了六十多年，才被普遍应用。
    说六六六和滴滴涕最有历史意义，首先是因为它们杀虫效力强大、杀虫种类众多，对人、畜和农作物的毒害小……但更重要的，却是因为它们作出了很好的榜样，很快地引起了许多效力更强的杀虫灭菌剂的发明。如1605、1059等以含磷为特点的“有机磷杀虫剂”，以及以含氟、汞、硫等为特点的各种各样的产品，都是紧接着它们的被发现而产生的。
    近年来，由于苏联生物学家和化学家的共同研究，更获得了许多具有高度性能的农药，可以随意促进、阻抑或停止植物生长。此外，还有防止马铃薯、糖用甜菜和葱类在储存时发芽，提高棉花的出花率的药剂，以及灭除杂草、脱去叶子，以便收割用的去叶剂，促进生根、利于移栽的生根剂。
    解放以后，我国农药研究和生产，蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。1952年，滴滴涕、六六六、1605等几种重要的有机杀虫剂都制造出来了。现在六六六的产量，已经跃居到世界第一位。1958年大跃进以来，农药生产也迅速地向前跃进了。高效、价廉的无机内吸杀虫剂“农用氨基磺酸钙”，能代替波尔多液、防治小麦赤霉病和锈病的“二硝基硫氰代苯”、防治棉花苗期炭疽病和立枯病的“五氯硝基苯”，以及效力能和1605媲美，而对人、畜的毒性又较小的有机磷杀虫剂“乙基马拉松”等等，都试制成功，投入了生产。此外，还生产了有名的“二四滴”和“萘乙酸钠”等植物生长刺激剂。土农药的发展更快，大跃进中发掘出来的就有五百多种，全国建立了二百四十多万个土农药厂，使用的药量达一千七百多万吨。中央有关的十个单位还联合组成了“土农药科学研究办公室”来指导土农药生产。在农药这个领域内，古代劳动人民积累下来的丰富遗产，我们正在使它发扬光大。
