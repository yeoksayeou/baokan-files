Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Jiangxi's more than seventeen million people's commune members are fully launching a "surpassing the program" high-yield movement, striving to achieve the grain production targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. Currently, the "surpassing the program" movement has been fully launched across the province, forming a large-scale competition between special districts, counties, and communes.

Recently, according to the provincial party committee's policy of taking grain as the key link, centering on grain, cotton, oil, and pigs, and comprehensively developing agricultural production, as well as the province's agricultural production plan targets for 1960, party organizations at all levels have universally mobilized the masses to discuss and re-arrange plans for achieving the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. Based on the experience of continuous great leaps forward in agricultural production over the past two years and the favorable conditions for agricultural production this year, all localities unanimously believe that it is entirely possible to achieve the grain aspect of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. First, the people's communes have all embarked on a path of sound and consolidated development. Second, after two consecutive years of great leaps in production, all localities have accumulated a solid material foundation and rich experience. Last year, eighteen counties and cities, four hundred and twenty-six communes, and five thousand six hundred and seventy-three production teams in the province had already surpassed the program in grain yield per mu, reaching eight hundred to one thousand jin or more, setting advanced examples for all localities and enhancing their confidence in surpassing the program. Third, since last winter, all localities have made great achievements in water conservancy construction, accumulating and producing fertilizers, and improving soil. All of these have laid the foundation for continuing to achieve a great leap forward this year.

The "surpassing the program" high-yield movement marks that Jiangxi Province's agriculture is entering a new stage of comprehensive high yield. In this movement, party organizations at all levels, with the thought of continuous revolution, organize the continuous leap forward of production, and persistently and unremittingly mobilize the masses, sweeping away all conservative ideas such as "production has reached its peak" and "only conditions matter." The main measures taken by all localities to increase production this year are: 1. Vigorously grasp the expansion of cultivated land area, increase the multiple cropping index, and comprehensively promote "three changes," that is, changing single-season to double-season, dry land to paddy fields, and wasteland to arable land. 2. Implement the policy of combining multiple planting for multiple harvests and high yield for multiple harvests, grasping both high-yield and low-yield fields at the same time, and striving to expand the area of early rice. Comprehensively and thoroughly transform low-yield fields. 3. Implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture with high standards and high quality, ensuring that each link is tightly linked, grasped to the end, and implemented throughout the year. Now all localities have implemented the area, measures, and yield of food crops to each plot of land.

Expanding the planting of early rice and planting early rice well are the keys to achieving the "surpassing the program" goal for grain throughout the year. Now all localities are concentrating more than 80% of their labor force on early rice production. The local prefectural, county, and commune party committees, led by the first secretary, have organized a large number of cadres to go deep into the front line of production, contracting areas at each level, participating in production, leading production, and fighting alongside the masses. Under the slogan of "Thousands of personnel go into battle, millions of troops mobilize, turn the world upside down, and make a big scene of spring plowing," the Fuzhou Special District's one hundred and six communes are vigorously grasping the six key factors of sufficient water, sufficient fertilizer, good seeds, strong seedlings, deep plowing, and close planting for early rice, and are conducting inspections, immediately adding measures to make up for any deficiencies found. The early rice seedling fields in the entire district have all achieved good seed and strong seedling status. In Ganxian County, which surpassed the program in grain yield last year, the county's three hundred and twenty thousand commune members are vigorously grasping the preparatory work before early rice transplanting, launching a "four-ization" movement of refining plowing and harrowing, ensuring sufficient base fertilizer, ensuring tender and strong seedlings, and standardizing close planting, striving to apply sufficient base fertilizer and eliminate third-class seedlings before transplanting. In order to ensure that grain production surpasses the program this year, many areas with previously low yields, the commune members are marching on expeditions and doing everything possible to transform low-yield fields. Under the slogan of "grasping high yield and grasping low yield, realizing high yield per mu," Shangyou County organized one hundred and forty thousand commune members to vigorously transform low-yield fields. They adopted a comprehensive transformation method that combines water, fertilizer, and soil, and combines agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and prepared irrigation, drainage, and flood control projects for all low-yield fields. Each mu of low-yield field was applied with an average of more than seven hundred and forty dan of various fertilizers, and two hundred and eighty-two year-round fertilizer accumulation and production bases were established beside the fields, centered on pig farms.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, April 15th: Jiangxi's localities are concentrating their efforts to vigorously grasp the preparatory work before transplanting with high standards and high quality requirements. Jian, Fuzhou, Shangrao, Yichun, Jiujiang and other special districts, under the slogan of "resolutely eliminate third-class seedlings before transplanting," launched a major inspection and evaluation to compare the quality of plowing and harrowing, the application of sufficient base fertilizer, the sturdiness of seedlings, and the rationality of close planting. The local party committee secretaries took the lead, organizing a large number of cadres to go deep into the fields with the commune members, immediately adding measures to make up for any problems found, and promoting meticulous and solid preparation work for transplanting. Now, most of the overturned early rice fields in all localities have been densely plowed and finely harrowed, and fertilizer has been applied in layers, with an average of more than five hundred dan of base fertilizer applied per mu, an increase of one to two times compared with last year. Most of the seedling fields have been made free of insects and barnyard grass, and the seedlings are tender, green and robust.

Jiangxi's early rice planting area this year is larger than last year, and transplanting will soon begin in full swing. All localities believe that to strive for a comprehensive high yield of early rice, the main key at present lies in transplanting the seedlings well. To this end, all localities have organized the masses to launch a high-standard, high-quality campaign to attack the first hurdle of early rice transplanting. First of all, they have grasped deep plowing and fine harrowing and applying sufficient base fertilizer. The Yichun Special District's people's communes, in accordance with the requirements of deep plowing of paddy fields to five inches or more and three plowing and six harrowing, have universally established specialized organizations for plowing and harrowing, implementing the method of fixing people, fixing fields, fixing quality, and fixing quantity; inspection and evaluation groups have been established, and inspection and acceptance are carried out wherever plowing and harrowing are carried out. After the hard struggle of the vast number of commune members, more than 90% of the district's three million mu of early rice fields have now completed the plowing and harrowing tasks according to quality and quantity. The Fuzhou Special District's one hundred and six communes put forward the slogan of "high standards for turning the fields, realizing refinement," and the overturned early rice fields have already achieved four plowing and eight harrowing. All localities, in conjunction with plowing and harrowing, have also universally carried out fertilizer inspection and supplementary fertilization, providing sufficient base fertilizer for early rice fields. Lean and Jinxi counties in mountainous areas organized inspection teams to go deep into distant fields, mountain pit fields, and low-yield fields, inspecting and launching a fertilizer delivery and supplementary fertilization blitz week, concentrating the main labor force to process and add fertilizer for these fields. All localities paid attention to applying fertilizer according to the field conditions and rational application of fertilizer, sending fine fertilizer to distant and barren fields, and coarse fertilizer to nearby and good fields.

Cultivating strong seedlings and good seedlings, ensuring quality and quantity, is the second important measure grasped by all localities. After a period of resisting cold and protecting seedlings, all localities have overcome the cold wave invasion, and the seedlings are generally growing well. On this basis, they are now further inspecting the seedling fields and adding supplementary measures. The Yichun Special District's communes, under the slogan of "more effort on top of effort, icing on the cake, realizing first-class seedlings in every plot," the seedling cultivation specialists stick to the fields, dividing the seedling fields into plots for inspection and ranking, checking the fields and seedlings to process and topdress, and removing insects and weeds. The Dongxiang County's communes launched a competition to evaluate "four-free standard seedling fields" (no third-class seedlings, no rotten seedlings, no weeds, no insect pests), so that every plot of seedling field quickly reached the "four-free" requirements. Many areas are now focusing their seedling cultivation on third-class seedlings, and are blitzing the application of quick-acting fertilizer to third-class seedlings, striving to upgrade all third-class seedlings before transplanting.

In order to ensure that all early rice is rationally and densely planted this year, all localities have fully mobilized the masses, starting from summarizing the experience of increasing production through close planting, launched a major debate on close planting, and implemented the close planting specification standards to the fields as early as possible.

    扩大耕地面积，彻底改造低产田，以高标准贯彻八字宪法
    江西全面展开“跨纲要”高产运动
    80％以上劳力投入早稻生产为多种种好早稻而战
    据新华社讯　江西全省一千七百多万人民公社社员全面展开“跨纲要”高产运动，力争提前实现农业发展纲要规定的粮食产量指标。目前，各地“超纲要”运动已全面展开，全省形成了专区与专区、县与县、社与社之间的大竞赛。
    最近以来，各地党组织根据省委提出的以粮为纲，以粮、棉、油、猪为中心，全面发展农业生产的方针和1960年全省农业生产计划指标，普遍发动群众讨论和重新安排提前实现农业发展纲要的计划。各地根据两年来农业生产连续大跃进的经验和今年农业生产的有利条件，一致认为在粮食方面提前实现农业发展纲要是完全可能的。首先，人民公社已全部走上了健全、巩固发展的道路。第二，经过连续两年的生产大跃进，各地积累了雄厚的物质基础和丰富的经验。去年全省已有十八个县市、四百二十六个公社、五千六百七十三个生产大队粮食亩产跨过纲要，达到了八百斤至千斤以上，为各地树起了先进的榜样，增强了各地跨纲要的信心。第三，去冬以来，各地在水利建设积肥造肥、改良土壤等方面已取得了巨大成绩。所有这些，都为今年继续实现大跃进打下了基础。
    “跨纲要”的高产运动，标志着江西省农业正在跨进一个全面高产的新阶段。在这个运动中，各级党组织以不断革命的思想，组织生产的不断跃进，坚持不懈地深入发动群众，横扫一切“增产到顶论”“唯条件论”等保守思想。今年各地采取的主要增产措施是：一、狠抓扩大耕地面积，提高复种指数，全面推广“三变”，即一季变双季，旱地变水田，荒地变熟地。二、贯彻多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，高产田、低产田同时抓，努力扩大早稻面积。对低产田全面进行彻底改造。三、以高标准、高质量贯彻农业“八字宪法”，做到环环紧扣，一抓到底，全年贯彻。现在各地已把粮食作物的面积、措施、产量全部落实到丘。
    扩种早稻，种好早稻，这是实现全年粮食“跨纲要”的关键。现在各地都集中80％以上的劳动力投入早稻生产。各地委、县委和公社党委，由第一书记挂帅，组织了大批干部深入到生产第一线，层层分片包干，参加生产、领导生产，与群众共同奋战。抚州专区一百零六个公社在“千员上阵，万军出动，翻天复地，大闹春耕”的口号下，大抓早稻水足、肥饱、良种、壮秧、深耕、密植六个关键，并且进行检查，发现不足立即加补措施。全区的早稻秧田全部实现了良种化、壮秧化。去年粮食跨纲要的赣县，全县三十二万社员狠抓早稻插秧前的准备工作，展开了犁耙精细化、基肥充足化、秧苗嫩壮化、密植规格化的
  “四化”运动，力争下足基肥，把三类苗消灭在插秧前。许多原来产量较低的地区，为了保证今年粮食跨纲要，社员们远征野战，千方百计改造低产田。上犹县在“抓高产也抓低产，实现亩亩高产化”的口号下，组织十四万社员大力改造低产田。他们采取水、肥、土并重，农、林、牧相结合的综合改造办法，为全部低产田作好了灌溉、排水防洪工程，每亩低产田平均施各种肥料七百四十多担，并以养猪场为中心在田边建立了二百八十二个常年积肥造肥基地。
    据新华社南昌15日电　江西各地集中力量以高标准、高质量的要求狠抓插秧以前的准备工作。吉安、抚州、上饶、宜春、九江等专区在“坚决把三类苗消灭在插秧前”的口号下，展开了比犁田耙田质量、比施足基肥、比秧苗粗壮、比合理密植的大检查大评比。各地党委书记挂帅，组织大批干部，同社员一道深入田间，发现问题立即加补措施，促使各项插秧准备工作做得细致扎实。现在，各地翻沤的早稻田绝大部分都做到了密犁细耙，分层施肥，平均每亩施基肥五百担以上，比去年增加一两倍。秧田大都做到了无虫、无稗，秧苗嫩绿茁壮。
    江西今年早稻种植面积比去年扩大，目前即将全面开始插秧。各地认为争取早稻全面高产，当前主要关键在于把秧插好。为此，各地组织群众开展了高标准、高质量、猛攻早稻插秧第一关的运动。首先，抓紧了深耕细耙和施足基肥。宜春专区各人民公社按照稻田深耕五寸以上和三犁六耙的要求，普遍建立了犁田耙田的专业组织，实行定人、定田、定质量、定数量的办法；建立了检查评比组，犁耙到那里，验收到那里。经过广大社员突击奋战，现在全区三百多万亩早稻田90％以上都已按质、按量完成犁耙任务。抚州专区一百零六个公社提出“翻田高标准，实现精细化”的口号，翻沤的早稻田已经做到四犁八耙。各地结合犁田耙田还普遍进行了查肥、补肥，为早稻田施足基肥。山区的乐安、金溪等县组织检查组，深入远田、山坑田、低产田，一边检查，一边开展送肥补肥突击周，集中主要劳力为这些田加工加肥。各地注意了看田施肥，合理施肥，把精肥送远田瘦田，粗肥送近田好田。
    育壮秧、育好秧，保质保量，是各地抓的第二项重要措施。各地经过前一段抗寒护秧，战胜了寒潮侵袭，秧苗生长普遍良好。在这个基础上，现在又进一步检查秧田，加补措施。宜春专区各公社在“劲上更加劲，锦上再添花，实现丘丘秧苗一类化”的口号下，育秧专业队员坚守田边，对秧田分丘检查排队，看田看秧加工追肥，除虫除稗。东乡县各公社掀起“四无标准秧田”
  （无三类秧、无烂秧、无杂草、无虫害）的评比竞赛，使丘丘秧田都迅速达到了“四无”的要求。许多地区现在都把育秧重点放在三类秧上，为三类秧突击加施速效肥，力争在插秧前使全部三类秧升级。
    各地为保证今年早稻全部合理密植，都充分发动群众，从总结密植增产的经验入手，开展密植大辩论，把密植规格标准提早落实到田。（附图片）
