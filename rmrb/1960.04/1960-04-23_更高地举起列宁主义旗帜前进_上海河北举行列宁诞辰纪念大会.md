The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China solemnly held a "Grand Meeting Commemorating the Ninetieth Anniversary of the Birth of the Great Proletarian Revolutionary Teacher Lenin" at the Cultural Square this afternoon. More than 8,000 people attended the commemorative meeting.

Chen Pixian, Cao Diqiu, Wei Wenbo, alternate secretaries Shi Ximin, Liu Shuzhou of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, members and alternate members of the Municipal Party Committee, representatives of the National People's Congress and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Shanghai, representatives of the Municipal People's Congress, members of the Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, heads of various departments of the municipal and district party and government organs, officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai (Army, Navy, and Air Force), representatives of advanced producers and advanced workers, and prominent figures from all walks of life attended today's meeting.

Invited to attend the meeting were: Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, Yelisha维金, consuls general and consular staff of various brotherly countries stationed in Shanghai, Soviet and brotherly countries' experts in Shanghai, and members of delegations from brotherly countries visiting Shanghai.

The commemorative meeting was presided over by Chen Pixian, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. Shi Ximin, alternate Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a report entitled "Hold High the Banner of Leninism and Advance Further!" at the meeting.

In his report, Shi Ximin said that the great Lenin, with his infinite loyalty to the international workers' movement and his firm Marxist principled stance, carried out heroic and extraordinary struggles, thoroughly smashed the revisionist trend of thought of the Second International, defended the purity of Marxism, and comprehensively developed and enriched Marxism in philosophy, political economy, and scientific socialism, opening up a new stage of Marxism. After Lenin's death, under the brilliant illumination of Leninism, the world proletarian revolutionary cause has achieved extremely great victories along the path of the October Revolution opened up by Lenin. He said that the Chinese people have always regarded Lenin as their closest and greatest friend and mentor. The victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary cause is inseparable from Lenin's name.

Shi Ximin said that at present, the international proletariat is facing the sacred task of resolutely defending Marxism-Leninism and thoroughly criticizing modern revisionism represented by Tito. For the victory of the communist cause and the unity of the international working class, we must hold high the banner of Leninism, inherit Lenin's legacy, and, like Lenin, continue to wage an irreconcilable principled struggle against modern revisionism and carry this struggle through to the end.

Shi Ximin said that today, as we commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of the great proletarian revolutionary teacher Lenin, the people of Shanghai are vigorously carrying out a mass technical revolution, a production revolution, a cultural revolution, and an ideological revolution, and are vigorously establishing urban people's communes. New things are emerging every day in an endless stream. All this marks that the entire face of our Shanghai is about to undergo a more profound change and will accelerate our process of building a new socialist Shanghai. At this time, commemorating Lenin's ninetieth birthday, we must further deepen our study of Lenin's revolutionary spirit and Leninist doctrine, and more firmly grasp the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism. This is a reliable guarantee for us to continue to win greater victories.

After the commemorative meeting, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra performed Shostakovich's "Eleventh Symphony" and other programs.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 22nd. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a commemorative meeting tonight with more than 2,000 representatives from all walks of life participating, solemnly commemorating the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of the great proletarian revolutionary teacher Lenin.

The commemorative meeting was presided over by Wan Xiaotang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee. Liu Zihou, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a report entitled "Hold High the Banner of Leninism and Carry the Socialist Revolution Through to the End" at the meeting. In his report, he said that Lenin inherited the great theories of Marx and Engels and brilliantly developed Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, pushing Marxism to a new stage. Leninism's great thought pointed out the glorious path of complete liberation and the establishment of a happy human society for the world proletariat and all oppressed and exploited people.

Liu Zihou said that the victory of the Chinese revolution is one of the greatest victories of Marxism-Leninism. Our country's socialist cause strictly follows the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism in all basic principles and faithfully inherits and develops the glorious cause of the October Revolution. At present, our country's socialist revolution has achieved great victory, and a new situation of leap-forward development in socialist construction has emerged. Commemorating the great Lenin and holding high the banner of Leninism is extremely important for carrying our socialist revolution through to the end, promoting the continuous leap forward of our country's socialist construction at high speed, carrying the struggle against imperialism through to the end, consolidating and developing the cause of defending world peace, and quickly building our country into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern scientific culture.

Liu Zihou finally said that the great Leninist doctrine has not only played a great guiding role in the cause of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship and in the international communist movement in the past few decades, but also plays and will continue to play an even greater guiding role now and in the future. The more victorious the world proletariat's revolution is, the more fully it proves the great and invincible power of Leninist thought. Liu Zihou called on everyone to earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong's works, hold high the banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and achieve greater victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Attending the commemorative meeting were: members of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, members of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, representatives of the National People's Congress in Tianjin, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, members of the provincial and municipal committees of the CPPCC, heads of the Tianjin Garrison, heads of local organizations of various democratic parties in the province and city, advanced producers and advanced workers, presidents of various universities, famous professors, scientists, artists, actors, and well-known figures from overseas Chinese and ethnic minorities.
