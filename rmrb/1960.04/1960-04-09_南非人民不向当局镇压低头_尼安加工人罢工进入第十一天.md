Xinhua News Agency, April 8th, Cape Town Dispatch: Ignoring condemnation from world opinion, the South African Federal Government brazenly dispatched large numbers of police again on the morning of the 8th to conduct large-scale searches nationwide. More than one hundred people were arrested this time.

The news said that this large-scale search began at 2:30 in the morning and lasted until 6:30 in the morning. The search area was very wide, including major South African cities such as Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, and Pretoria.

At the same time, South African Minister of Justice Erasmus announced in Parliament on the 8th that the activities of the African National Congress and the Pan-Africanist Congress were banned until April 6, 1961.

The large-scale strike of 25,000 African workers in the Nyanga township on the outskirts of Cape Town, in protest against the South African Federal "Pass Laws," entered its eleventh day on the 7th. On the morning of the 7th, the South African authorities once again dispatched large numbers of military police, under the protection of armored vehicles, to attack Nyanga again. They broke down doors and windows and rushed into houses, brutally beating African men, women, and children, and conducting house-to-house searches. During the search, residents were not even allowed to go to the outdoor toilets.

According to the Cape Town police authorities, on this day, the military police arrested 1,525 Africans in Nyanga who were not at work. They were transported to Cape Town prison in truckloads; even all their knives, sticks, and meat cleavers were confiscated as "weapons."

In addition to armed suppression, the South African authorities also attempted to force the Africans to submit through unemployment and hunger. South African Minister of Justice Erasmus announced on the evening of the 6th that the South African government prohibits employers from employing Africans without "passes." Some South African capitalists are also clamoring to replace Africans with colored people.

However, the suppression and threats of the South African authorities and monopoly capitalists cannot frustrate the fighting will of the Africans. News reports say that a large number of African workers are determined not to be slaves for the capitalists anymore and have left the city. In Cape Town alone, more than 2,000 Africans have returned to their "reserves" since March 21.

At the same time, the South African Pan-Africanist Congress also issued a statement on the 7th, calling on Africans to strengthen the struggle against the "Pass Laws" and demanding an end to the "state of emergency." The statement said, "We have no need to carry identity cards (passes), and no amount of argument can convince us otherwise." This statement was issued in response to Erasmus's statement demanding that Africans produce "passes."

### 南非人民不向当局镇压低头  尼安加工人罢工进入第十一天

    南非人民不向当局镇压低头
    尼安加工人罢工进入第十一天
    新华社8日讯　开普敦消息：南非联邦政府不顾世界舆论的谴责，8日清晨又派出大批警察悍然在全国进行大规模搜捕。这次被捕的人在一百名以上。
    消息说，这次大规模搜捕从清晨两时半开始，一直到早上六时半才结束。搜捕的地区很广，包括约翰内斯堡、开普敦、德班、伊丽莎白港和比勒陀利亚等南非主要城市。
    与此同时，南非政府司法部长伊来斯马斯8日在议会宣布，禁止非洲人国民大会和泛非主义者大会的活动，直到1961年4月6日为止。
    开普敦郊区尼安加市镇两万五千名非洲工人为反抗南非联邦“通行证法”而举行的大规模罢工，到7日已经进入第十一天。7日清晨，南非当局又派出大批军警在装甲车的护卫下再次对尼安加进行了袭击。他们打破门窗冲进室内，野蛮地殴打非洲男、女和小孩，还进行挨户搜捕。在搜捕时，居民甚至不得走到户外的厕所去。
    据开普敦警察当局宣布，这一天军警在尼安加逮捕的没有上工的非洲人达一千五百二十五人。他们被一卡车一卡车地运往开普敦监狱；甚至连他们所有的一切小刀、棍棒和切肉的斧子也都被当作“武器”给没收了。
    南非当局除了武装镇压外，还企图以失业和饥饿来迫使非洲人屈服。南非司法部长伊来斯马斯在6日晚曾宣布，南非政府禁止雇主雇用没有“通行证”的非洲人。南非一些资本家也在叫嚣要用有色人来代替非洲人。
    但是，南非当局和垄断资本家的镇压和威胁并不能挫折非洲人的斗争意志。有消息说，大批非洲工人坚决不再为资本家当牛马，已经离开城市。仅开普敦一地，自3月21日以来就已有二千多非洲人回到他们的“保留地。”
    同时，南非泛非主义者大会7日也发表声明，号召非洲人加强反对“通行证法”的斗争，并且要求结束“紧急状态”。声明说，“我们没有必要携带身份证（通行证），不论提出多少论据也不能使我们相信其他意见”。这个声明是针对伊来斯马斯发表的又要非洲人出示“通行证”的声明而发表的。
