Comrades Chairman and fellow members:

Qingpu County in Shanghai has long been known as a land of fish and rice, famous for its freshwater fish, crabs, and perch. The county has nearly 640,000 mu of cultivated land, with over 360,000 mu of watery areas. It has a population of about 310,000, including 1,685 fishing households, totaling over 7,000 people. Since liberation, like other regions in the motherland, this area has gone through three historical stages of organization: mutual aid teams, cooperatives, and people's communes. Through practical experience, fishermen have universally enhanced their understanding of the superiority of socialism. In October 1958, a new chapter in history was unveiled here with the establishment of people's communes, including the merger of twenty-two fishery production cooperatives into the Liberation Commune.

The Liberation Commune comprises 856 households, with a total membership of 3,528 people, and a labor force of 1,191, divided into ten fishery production teams.

**Before Liberation: Fishing Folk Were Poor for Generations**

I remember there was an old film depicting the lives of Chinese fishermen called "Song of the Fisherman," which contained these lyrics:

　　Anxiously awaiting signs of fish in the mist,
　　Daybreak comes, strength is spent,
　　Eyes look towards the fishing village, a long way off.
　　Waist aches, hands are swollen,
　　Catching fish, yet stomach is empty.

　　Fish are hard to catch, taxes and rent are heavy,
　　Fishing folk are poor for generations,
　　Grandfather's old fishing net,
　　Must be carefully relied upon to get through another winter.

In the past, the lives of fishermen were indeed so impoverished and miserable, living from day to day. What was even more outrageous was the rampant exploitation by fishing despots, who stopped at nothing. They colluded with local bureaucratic forces. Even fishermen passing through waterways had to pay tolls and taxes. Furthermore, fishing despots forcibly purchased the fruits of fishermen's labor. They would buy fish at twenty-four taels to a jin, and sell at fourteen taels to a jin. This unfair weighing was simply daylight robbery. Even at these unreasonable low prices, fishermen could not get cash on the same day. Everyone knew that hyperinflation was rampant, especially in the later years of the Kuomintang. The currency devalued several times a day, so getting the fish money after a day or two was like receiving scraps of paper.

Fishermen had no land-based homes and lived on small boats for generations. The boat's canopy was just a reed mat, with "white lice boards" underneath. The so-called white lice boards were just broken boat planks, because fishermen slept on them for generations, and they became heavily soiled with accumulated sweat and grime, becoming breeding grounds for white lice, so fishermen simply called these broken boat planks "white lice boards." Most of the fishing boats were dilapidated and leaky. Even sleeping on the boat at night required shifts, because the boat leaked, and someone had to constantly bail out the water, otherwise the water would accumulate, and those sleeping on the boat would drown at the bottom of the river. As the ancients said, "Ten thousand people become fish," which was indeed true. At the time, fishermen had a folk song:

　　Nets are broken, no money to buy, fishing boat leaks, no money to repair,
　　No reed mats on top, water flows into the broken boat,
　　Fishing gear is tattered, production is low in small lakes and ponds,
　　Large lakes and ponds are prone to disaster.

The fishermen's peak season was short, lasting only from the 5th to the 9th month of the lunar calendar. During the off-season, there was no production, and they had to beg for food. Another folk song:

　　In the past, fishermen ate bran and vegetable for half a year,
　　Having breakfast, but no supper,
　　Working hard in peak season,
　　Begging for food in off season,
　　Eating vegetables in winter to fill the stomach,
　　Begging for food during the New Year, suffering people's scorn,
　　Wearing clothes as garments during the day and as blankets at night,
　　Using the same towel to wipe the face and wash the body.

　　One family, one boat, drifting east and west,
　　Starving to death on the boat, no one cares,
　　Three generations of ancestors lie in one cabin.

Fishermen's wives would start working only three days after giving birth. Parents would catch fish at the bow of the boat, while the children at the stern were left unattended, often drowning, falling into the pot and being scalded to death, or freezing to death due to lack of clothing. The various tragic scenes are countless.

According to the Qingpu County Magistrate: In the past, an average of about 200 people drowned in the county each year. In the event of a typhoon, some fishermen's entire families would die along with their boats, which was commonplace and not surprising. Education was simply out of the question for fishermen before liberation.

**After Liberation: Happy Life and Full of Enthusiasm**

I. In terms of production:

After liberation, the fishing industry in Qingpu County has developed rapidly, with annual output continuously increasing. Especially during the high tide of the Great Leap Forward and after the establishment of people's communes, everything has leaped forward, full of vigor and high spirits.

Taking the Liberation Commune as an example: the aquaculture area in 1958 was 5,500 mu, and after the Great Leap Forward, it increased to 18,200 mu. In 1958, the "fish fry pond" was 200 mu, cultivating 2.5 million fish fry (about three inches or more). After the Great Leap Forward, it increased to 1,400 mu, with 40 million fish fry. The catch volume is also constantly increasing:

　　1949 Annual fish production 11,800 dan
　　1957 Annual fish production 29,200 dan
After the establishment of the People's Commune:

　　1958 Annual fish production 54,600 dan
　　1959 Annual fish production 116,320 dan

The plan for 1960 is to strive to reach 200,000 dan, ensuring 140,000 dan are put on the market. The production of pigs, ducks, chickens, etc., will also double compared to 1959. Production tools are also constantly increasing. There are now 27 types of fishing nets, with more than 4,000 sets of various sizes. In the past, large fishing nets were only 100 meters long, but now they have been increased to a total of 4,000 meters long. There are already 1,100 fishing boats. There are 153 crab weirs. (Bamboo-woven crab catching tools)

II. In terms of living conditions:

The lives of fishermen have greatly improved. Before the establishment of the Liberation Commune, the average income per person (large and small) in the 22 fishery production cooperatives was:

　　1949 50 yuan
　　1956 105 yuan

After the establishment of the Liberation Commune, the average income per person (large and small) was:

　　1958 123 yuan
　　1959 154 yuan and 64 fen

According to the above income, it can be seen that the lives of fishermen are constantly improving. Since the establishment of the People's Commune, the development of the fishing industry has advanced by leaps and bounds, and the lives of fishermen have also greatly improved. The situation of not having enough to eat and wear is gone forever. Now, not only has the area developed both catching and raising fish, but every household is also engaged in sideline occupations. According to the Qingpu County Magistrate: Fishermen engaging in sideline occupations is unprecedented in history. Taking the achievements of the Liberation Commune in 1959 as an example, they raised 1,339 pigs (an average of three pigs for every two households), 92 sheep, and as many as 8,917 poultry.

As mentioned earlier: fishermen have lived on boats for generations. Now, taking the Liberation Commune as an example, 133 fishermen's households have moved ashore. A total of 178 new houses have been built. All the elderly have settled on land. This year, residential areas will also be established, and happiness homes will be set up.

After the Great Leap Forward, the County People's Committee established a typhoon prevention headquarters to do all the prevention work to ensure the safety of fishermen, for example: using black balls during the day and red lights at night to prevent typhoons from striking, etc.

We might as well take a look at the "No. 3 Bridge" aquaculture farm of the Liberation Commune. The farm has 82 members. Last year, they bought 1,927 chi of cotton cloth and 22 meters of woolen material. In the past, everyone was barefoot, but now they have bought 80 pairs of galoshes and 20 pairs of leather shoes, and everyone has a woolen sweater.

Shen Changsheng's family, a member of the Liberation Commune, used to have eleven people sharing one quilt. Now things are very different. He has taken two daughters-in-law, added ten cotton quilts and two silk quilts. Two grandsons have gone to school.

When we were watching by the fish pond road; a fisherman named Chen Simei (female), with her hands in the pockets of her cotton coat, said with a smile: she has ten sons, now five of them have taken brides, and the old couple and two young children are left at home. She said: Chairman Mao's method is really wonderful, making our lives better and better. I am almost sixty years old, and I look ten years younger than before liberation.

When fishermen are sick, minor illnesses are treated free of charge by the commune. For serious illnesses, care is provided according to the situation. Pregnant women have 20 days of maternity leave, and everything else is provided as usual.

Now fishermen not only have enough to eat and wear, but also pay attention to being beautiful. Young girls wear skirts and get their hair permed. They often sing happily:

　　(1) With one heart from top to bottom, yellow soil turns into gold. If one person has their own idea, they'll be poor to the bone.

　　(2) Great leap forward in production and construction, eternal happiness for generations. Future fishermen are more energetic, stars in the sky are countless, the benefits of the People's Commune are endless.

In 1959, after the fishermen received the fruits of their labor, everyone was in high spirits. The commune received 1,500 new photos of Chairman Mao, and in less than three days, everyone rushed to paste the photos in their homes. On the second day of the Spring Festival last year, fishermen asked to start working, their enthusiasm soaring.

III. In terms of culture, education, and technological innovation:

During the Great Leap Forward, culture and education also took a great leap forward. Before liberation, there were no schools, and children had no books to read. Illiteracy was everywhere. Now Qingpu County has 12 middle schools, 1 secondary normal school, 1 agricultural health school, 509 primary schools, and 43,843 primary school students. There are also 15 agricultural middle schools that combine labor with production. In 1959, after literacy studies, 11,138 people in the county have been freed from the illiteracy label. In the Liberation Commune, over 70% have been freed from the illiteracy label so far. The Liberation Commune has established a fishing tool reform group and an aquaculture tool reform group, creating many new technologies.

Based on the development of the fishermen in Qingpu County during the Great Leap Forward, it can be proved that only under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, only under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, only by holding high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, can the Chinese people create such miracles. The above is only about the fishing industry and the lives of fishermen in Qingpu County, Shanghai. In other aspects of the country, there are even more unprecedented and amazing miracles that are countless. Especially in 1959, in the context of the unprecedented disaster area of 650 million mu since the founding of the People's Republic of China, such great achievements were obtained. Our People's Commune is the best social organizational form for the transition from socialist society to communist society. It can thoroughly change the old image of our country being poor and blank. It can truly improve and improve people's lives. It powerfully shattered the slander of the imperialists and domestic and foreign reactionaries that the People's Commune was "badly run." It also resolutely shattered the absurd fallacy of the right-leaning opportunists that the "Great Leap Forward" was too fast. Since our country is a poor and blank country, we must quickly become rich and strong by combining domestic and foreign situations. Then it must be recognized that in the process of high-speed socialist construction and development, some shortcomings and losses are inevitable. Absolutely not to ignore or deny the achievements and gains of the "whole" with the shortcomings or losses of the "point". This is the correct way.

Let us hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and move forward, forward, leap forward, leap forward, and leap forward again!

### 渔民生活大改善  董竹君委员谈上海市青浦县渔民的情况

专栏：

    渔民生活大改善
    董竹君委员谈上海市青浦县渔民的情况主席、各位委员：
    上海青浦县素称鱼米之乡，在渔业方面以产淡水鱼、蟹、鲈鱼等为著名。全县耕地近六十四万亩，水泽地带占三十六万亩多，人口约三十一万，渔民一千六百八十五户，计七千多人。解放后这里像祖国其他地区一样，经过了互助组，合作社，人民公社三个历史阶段的组织形式，渔民们通过了具体的生活实践，对社会主义优越性的认识，都有了普遍的提高。1958年10月在这里揭开了历史的新页，成立了人民公社，其中由二十二个渔业生产合作社，合并成解放公社了。
    解放公社计八百五十六户，社员共三千五百二十八人，劳动力有一千一百九十一人，分为十个渔业生产队。
    解放前：捕鱼的人儿世世穷
    记得很早有一部描写我国渔民生活的影片——“渔光曲”里面有这样几句歌词：
    烟雾里辛苦等鱼踪，
    天已明、力已尽，
    眼望着渔村路万重。
    腰已酸、手已肿，
    捕得了鱼儿腹内空。
    鱼儿难捕税租重，
    捕鱼人儿世世穷，
    爷爷留下的破鱼网，
    小心再靠它过一冬。
    过去渔民的生活，确实是这样的贫困悲惨，朝不保夕。更令人愤慨的是渔霸横行掠夺，无所不为。他们与地方官僚势力串通一气。甚至渔民经过河道，也要丢下买路钱，缴纳租税。此外，渔霸强迫收购渔民的劳动果实。二十四两秤作为一斤买进，以十四两秤作为一斤卖出，秤而不平，简直是明火打劫了。即使按照这样不合理的低价，渔民当天还取不到现钱。当时通货膨胀，尤其是国民党后期的恶性通货膨胀是谁都知道的。币值一日数跌，过一二天取到了鱼钱，无异拿到了几张废纸。
    渔民没有陆上的住所，世世代代生活在小船上。小船顶篷只是一席苇箔，下面是白虱板垫着。所谓白虱板，就是破船板，因为渔民世世代代都在上面睡觉，为积年累月的汗垢所污，成为白虱大量繁殖的地方，干脆渔民就把这些破船板称之为白虱板了。渔船多是破漏不堪的。就是夜间去船里睡觉也要轮班，因为船底漏水，必须留人不时清去积水，否则积水过多，船上睡觉的人等于葬身河底。古人说：“万人成鱼”，真是确实的话。当时渔民曾有一首歌谣：
    网具破了无钱买，渔船漏了无钱修，
    上面没有芦席盖，破船水要流进来，
    捉鱼工具又破烂，小湖小塘出产低，
    大湖大塘受灾难。
    渔民的旺季不长，“农历5、6、7、8、9月是旺季”，淡季无出产，只好去讨饭。另有歌谣：
    过去渔民吃的是糠菜半年粮，
    吃了早顿无夜顿，
    旺季搞出产，
    淡季要讨饭，
    冬季青菜来充饥，
    过年讨饭受人气，
    穿的是日当衣衫夜当被，
    揩面手巾也是伊。
    一家一船东漂西荡，
    饿死船上无人问，
    祖宗三代躺一舱。
    渔民妇女分娩，不过三朝就开始劳动。父母们在船头捞鱼，孩子们在船尾上无人照顾，经常有或落水淹死，或跌入锅中烫死，或因无衣穿而冻死，种种惨状不胜缕述。
    听青浦县长说：单是淹死的过去全县每年平均就有二百人左右，遇着台风时，有的渔民全家连人带船罹难而死，这是司空见惯，不足为怪的。什么上学念书，对于渔民来说，在解放前简直是谈不上念书上学这回事。
    解放后：生活幸福干劲足
    一、生产方面：
    解放后，青浦县渔业得到迅速的发展，年产量不断增加，尤其在大跃进高潮中，和成立人民公社以后，一切更有了飞跃的发展，朝气蓬勃，志气昂扬。
    就以解放公社来看：养殖水面1958年是五千五百亩，大跃进后，增至一万八千二百亩。1958年“鱼种塘”为二百亩，培育鱼种二百五十万尾。（鱼种约在三寸以上），大跃进后增长至一千四百亩，鱼种四千万尾，捕捞量也在不断地增加：
    1949年　鱼的年产量　一万一千八百担
    1957年　鱼的年产量　二万九千二百担人民公社成立后：
    1958年　鱼的年产量　五万四千六百担
    1959年　鱼的年产量　十一万六千三百二十担
    1960年计划争取达到二十万担，保证上市十四万担。猪、鸭、鸡等也要比1959年翻一番。生产工具也不断在增加。现已有鱼网二十七种，大小有四千多付。过去大型鱼网只有一百米长，现在已增大到共有四千米长。已有渔船一千一百条。蟹簖有一百五十三条。（用竹子编的捉蟹工具）
    二、在生活方面：
    渔民的生活大大提高了。在解放公社成立以前，二十二个渔业生产合作社，大小人口每人平均在：
    1949年分得　五十元
    1956年分得　一百零五元
    解放公社成立后，大小人口每人平均在：
    1958年分得　一百二十三元
    1959年分得　一百五十四元六角四分
    根据以上的收入，可见渔民生活是不断改善。自从人民公社成立后，渔业的发展突飞猛进，渔民生活也随着大大的提高。过去吃不饱，穿不暖的情况，是永去不返了。现在这里不仅发展到捕养并举，而且家家户户都搞副业，据青浦县县长说：渔民搞副业，是有历史以来没有过的。单以解放公社1959年的成绩来看，他们养猪一千三百三十九头（平均每两户有三头猪强），羊九十二只，家禽达八千九百一十七只之多。
    前面曾说过：渔民世世代代住在船上的；现在即以解放公社来说，已有一百三十三户渔民住上了陆地。计新建房屋一百七十八幢。老年人已全部在陆上定居了。今年还要建立居民点，成立幸福院。
    大跃进后，县人民委员会设立了防台指挥部，做好一切防御工作，保证渔民的安全，例如：白天用黑球，夜间点红灯，预防台风袭击等。
    我们不妨看一看现在的解放公社“三号桥”养殖场，该场社员有八十二人，去年买了一千九百二十七尺棉布，二十二米毛料，过去大家赤脚，现在买了套鞋八十双，皮鞋二十双，而且人人都有毛线衣。
    解放公社社员沈长生家，从前曾经是十一个人，共一条被。现在可大不同了，讨了两房媳妇，添了十条棉被，两条绸被。两个孙子上了学。
    当我们在鱼塘路旁观看时；有一位渔民叫陈四妹（女），她双手插在棉大衣袋里，满面笑容地说：她有十个儿子，现在五房讨了新娘，家里剩下她老夫妻俩，和两个幼儿。她说：毛主席想出来的办法真正妙，使我们生活越过越好，我快到六十岁了，看起来比解放前年轻了十岁。
    渔民有疾病时，病轻者，由公社免费治疗。病重者，根据情况，予以照顾。产妇分娩时，有假期二十天，其他一切照常供给。
    现在渔民不但穿暖、吃饱，还要讲究漂亮，青年姑娘穿裙烫发，她们常常快乐地唱：
    （一）上下一条心，黄土变成金。一人一条心，穷到骨头筋。
    （二）生产建设大跃进，世世代代的幸福万年青。今后的渔民越干越有劲，天上星星数不清，人民公社的好处说不尽。
    1959年渔民分得了自己的劳动果实后，个个情绪高涨，公社里新到毛主席的照片一千五百张，不到三天，大家都争先恐后把照片贴在自己的家中了。在去年春节初二，渔民纷纷要求开工劳动，干劲冲天。
    三、在文教和技术革新方面：
    在大跃进中，文教事业也大大的跃进了一步。解放前无学校，孩子们无书读，到处是文盲。现在青浦县已有中学十二所，中等师范一所，农业卫生学校一所，小学五百零九所，小学学生有四万三千八百四十三人，还有劳动结合生产的农业中学十五所。1959年通过扫盲学习后，全县已摘去文盲帽子的有一万一千一百三十八人。在解放公社方面，至今已摘去了文盲帽子的占70％以上。解放公社成立了捕捞工具改革组和养殖工具改革组，创造了许多新技术。
    根据以上青浦县的渔民大跃进的发展情况，就可以证明我国只有在党和毛主席的英明领导下，只有在党的总路线光辉照耀下，只有举起了总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的中国人民才会出现这样的奇迹。以上不过是仅以上海青浦县的渔业和渔民生活这一点来说，在全国其它各方面，更有史无前例，惊人的奇迹，是不胜枚举。尤其在1959年建国以来，未有过的灾害面积，达六亿五千万亩的情况下，得到这样伟大成就。我国人民公社是由社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会最好的社会组织形式。它能彻底改变了我国一穷二白的旧面貌，它真正能改善和提高人民的生活，它有力地粉碎了帝国主义和国内外反动派所谓人民公社
  “办糟了”的诬蔑。也坚决地粉碎了右倾机会主义分子所谓“大跃进”太快了的荒唐谬论。我国既是一穷二白的国家，则结合国内外形势必须迅速地富强起来。那么必须认识到在高速度社会主义建设发展过程中，若有些缺点和损失，那是不可避免的。绝不可以“点”的缺点或损失，来忽略或否定“面”的成绩和收获。这样才是正确的。
    让我们高举起毛泽东思想的旗帜前进，前进，跃进，跃进，再跃进吧！
