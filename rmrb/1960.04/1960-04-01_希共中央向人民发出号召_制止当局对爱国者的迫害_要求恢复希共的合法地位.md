Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch. The Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party issued a communique on the 26th, condemning the Greek government for intensifying its reign of terror in Greece. The communique stated that while the Greek authorities' frame-up case against Glezos is on appeal, the Greek government is preparing to conduct three more terror trials in April.

The communique said that, according to the fascist Decree No. 375 promulgated by the dictator Metaxas in 1939, a group of Greek communists and patriots who have already been imprisoned for many years will be tried in military courts on fabricated charges of "espionage." The communique pointed out that these trials are being conducted immediately after West German Defense Minister Strauss's visit to Greece and before the East-West summit is about to be held. This action by the Greek government once again proves the anti-people nature of the Greek government and its implementation of the Cold War policy. The communique said that the Greek people have risen up to oppose this policy, which is causing disaster to the Greek people, and oppose the attempt to tie Greece to the chariot of West German militarism. The Greek people demand understanding between countries, the development of friendship and expanded trade with socialist countries, the reduction of the people's burden, and construction and the establishment of peace in Greece.

The communique called on the Greek people to rise up and demand an end to persecution, the abolition of Decree No. 375, the release of Glezos and other patriots, and the restoration of the Greek Communist Party's legal status.

    希共中央向人民发出号召
    制止当局对爱国者的迫害  要求恢复希共的合法地位
    新华社29日讯　希腊共产党中央委员会26日发表公报，谴责希腊政府在希腊加紧恐怖统治。公报说，在希腊当局对格列索斯的诬告案正在上诉的时候，希腊政府却正准备在4月间再进行三起恐怖审讯。
    公报说，按照1939年独裁者麦税克萨斯颁布的第三百七十五号法西斯法令，一批已经被监禁了许多年的希腊共产党员和爱国者，将因被诬告的“间谍”罪在军事法庭受审。公报指出，这几起审讯是紧接着西德国防部长施特劳斯访问希腊和在东西方最高级会议将要举行之前进行的，希腊政府这种作法再一次证明希腊政府的反人民性质和它执行冷战政策。公报说，希腊人民已经起来反对这种使希腊人民遭受灾祸的政策，反对把希腊缚在西德军国主义战车上的企图。希腊人民要求各国之间谅解，同社会主义国家发展友谊和扩大贸易，减轻人民负担和在希腊进行建设和建立和平。
    公报号召希腊人民起来要求停止迫害，废除第三百七十五号法令，释放格列索斯和其他爱国者，并且恢复希腊共产党的合法地位。
