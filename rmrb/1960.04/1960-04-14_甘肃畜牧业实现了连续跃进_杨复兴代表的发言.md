Fellow representatives:
	I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960 and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state final accounts for 1959 and the draft state budget for 1960. Now, I would like to offer some opinions on animal husbandry in Gansu. Animal husbandry occupies an important position in Gansu's national economy. In the past two years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line for socialist construction, with the great leap forward in the national economy and the realization of the people's communes, animal husbandry has also achieved continuous leaps forward and made great achievements.
	The development of animal husbandry has brought many benefits. First of all, it provides fertilizer and power for agricultural production. More than 40% of the fertilizer needed for agriculture in Gansu is supplied by animal husbandry. At the same time, it adds an average of about 50,000 head of draft animals to agriculture every year, which strongly promotes agricultural production increase. Secondly, it provides industrial raw materials and foreign trade materials for the country, increasing national accumulation. From 1953 to 1959, the province's animal husbandry supplied a total of more than 600,000 dan of wool, cashmere, and bristles, more than 7 million hides, and a large number of other animal products. Thirdly, it provides a large amount of meat and dairy products to the market, further enriching the material life of the broad masses of people. Fourthly, it promotes the development of diversified economies and commodity production in the people's communes, which increases both the public accumulation of the communes and the income of the commune members. Fifthly, it has greatly prospered the economy and culture of the pastoral areas, strengthened national unity, and improved the living standards of the herdsmen. We Tibetan people have a particularly deep understanding of this.
	Since the Great Leap Forward, we have more deeply realized the interdependent relationship between animal husbandry and agriculture, and its important role in the entire national economy and people's lives. In particular, the central government's call to take pig raising as the center and comprehensively develop animal husbandry has further broadened our horizons and improved our understanding. In order to adapt to the new situation of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the national economy, rapidly developing animal husbandry has become an urgent task for us.
	The high-speed development of animal husbandry production is entirely achievable. Gansu has good natural conditions for developing animal husbandry, with more than 130,000 square kilometers of natural grassland. Animal husbandry also has a relatively long history, and the broad masses of people have accumulated rich experience. More importantly, the Party's general line and the two-legged walking policy have illuminated the road to high-speed development of animal husbandry; the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in the past two years has laid a solid material foundation, and support for animal husbandry has also been greatly strengthened; the consolidation and development of people's communes in agricultural and pastoral areas have opened up a broad world for animal husbandry. In such an unprecedentedly favorable situation, as long as we resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, implement the policy of "taking pigs as the head, emphasizing both pigs and cattle, comprehensively and rapidly developing animal husbandry, raising more pigs, accumulating more fertilizer, producing more grain, and supporting the high-speed development of agriculture," and focus on developing horses, cattle, and sheep in pastoral areas, giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of people, and launching a large-scale mass movement, we will surely be able to achieve a great leap forward in animal husbandry.
	In fact, in the past two years, animal husbandry in many places in Gansu has achieved high-speed development. In 1959, nine counties and cities in the province achieved comprehensive bumper harvests in animal husbandry. From August to December 1959, the number of pigs in the province increased by 690,000, and the number of large livestock increased by 290,000. The Taobian Production Team of Yanguan Commune in Xili County, led by Fan Xiucai, a national pig-raising model, had only two pigs in 1956, but after the Great Leap Forward in 1958, it increased sharply to more than 1,300, averaging more than 18 per household. The number of sheep in Huan County increased from more than 400,000 in 1958 to more than 550,000 in 1959, a growth rate of 36%, with an average of four sheep per person in the county. The Changle Brigade of the Minle Commune in Shandan had 116 suitable-age cows, which gave birth to 117 calves in 1959, with one cow giving birth to two calves. In the pastoral areas, due to the realization of people's communes, production capacity was greatly liberated, and the face of animal husbandry was completely renewed. From November last year to March this year, the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture produced more than 260,000 lambs, an increase of nearly 100% compared with the same period last year, and the survival rate reached 96%, an increase of more than 20% compared with last year. There are three production teams and one ranch with more than 100 lambs per 100 ewes. At present, 90% of the suitable-age female livestock in the prefecture are pregnant, and the pregnancy retention rate has reached 95%. Daoji, a 60-year-old Tibetan female breeder in Dewulu Commune, raised 22 sows, which all gave birth to three litters from September 1958 to September 1959, producing a total of 392 piglets, an increase of 17 times. In 1959, the Sunan Yugur Autonomous County's livestock increased by more than 27% net, including an 85% increase in pigs and a 15% increase in large livestock. With these local bumper harvests, it is possible to develop into a comprehensive Great Leap Forward. Based on this, we plan that the total number of livestock in the province in 1960 will increase by more than 53% net compared with 1959, including a net increase of more than two times in pigs and a net increase of more than 12% in large livestock.
	Based on our experience in practice, to develop animal husbandry at high speed, we must solve the key problems of breeding, feed, disease prevention, tool reform, and feeding management. In this regard, the Zhonglianchuan Production Team of the Gongjing Commune in Yuzhong County has created a set of advanced experiences. The pig farm of this team implements the policy of running the farm diligently and frugally, self-breeding and self-raising, selecting and breeding, and carefully feeding. It manages sows, pregnant sows, piglets, castrated boars, and fattening pigs in separate groups, and feeds them in separate troughs according to their size, strength, and speed of eating. It implements fixed people, fixed time, fixed quantity, fixed place, and fixed position, so that the pigs' lives are very regular and orderly. In terms of feed, it combines the appropriate matching of refined and coarse feed, the collection of wild feed, the utilization of agricultural and sideline products, and the planting of feed crops. At the same time, it carries out large-scale tool reform, realizing the mechanization of feed crushing and the self-flowing of drinking water, with each person raising an average of 150 to 200 pigs. The work of disease prevention and hygiene is also very prominent, achieving clean water, clean troughs, clean feed, and clean pig bodies, and carrying out regular injections and strengthening quarantine. The whole farm has also established a three-guarantee and one-reward system for guaranteeing the survival of piglets, guaranteeing fatness scores, guaranteeing fertilizer, and rewarding overproduction. On the basis of 60 pigs in 1956, this team has now developed to 5,243 pigs, an increase of 86 times. In particular, due to the great development of pig raising and the great increase in fertilizer, agriculture has achieved a great increase in production. In 1958, the number of pigs in this team increased by 1.4 times, and grain production increased by 90%; in 1959, the number of pigs increased by nearly 2 times, and grain production increased by more than 2 times. The Zhonglianchuan Production Team has set up a red flag of more, faster, better, and more economical for not only pig raising but also the entire animal husbandry industry. Its experience is being widely promoted throughout the province.
	Grassland construction in pastoral areas is a fundamental measure for developing animal husbandry. In the past, in the Gannan pastoral area, due to the rule of feudal reactionary forces and the shackles of superstitious ideas, many pastures were short of water and withered, and some even became barren beaches, causing great difficulties for the development of animal husbandry. The great victory of the anti-feudal struggle and the people's commune movement in 1958 ended this situation once and for all, and opened a new chapter in the history of grassland construction. Since last winter, a mass movement for large-scale grassland water conservancy has been launched, building 115 channels, irrigating more than 1.5 million mu of grassland, and it is expected that the production of pasture can be increased by more than 100%. At the same time, grassland planning has been carried out, and rotational grazing has been tried out, making the use of grassland more reasonable. Preliminary estimates indicate that the carrying capacity can be increased by at least 10 times. The broad masses of herdsmen have basically settled down, and new settlements are beginning to be built. Grassland construction not only promotes the great development of animal husbandry, but also fundamentally changes the nomadic life of the broad masses of herdsmen who have been living by water and grass for thousands of years, and promotes the comprehensive leap forward in the socialist construction of pastoral areas. All this makes us deeply feel that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our Tibetan people have been liberated, our cattle and sheep have developed, and our grasslands have also become lush.
	The great situation of high-speed development of animal husbandry has already unfolded before us, and the ideal of "abundant harvests of grain and prosperous livestock" that the people of all ethnic groups have yearned for for many years is becoming a reality. Let us, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, hold high the glorious banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, brave the wind and waves, and advance bravely!
	If there are any inappropriate points in the above speech, please criticize and correct them. Finally, I wish the conference a victory and good health to all the representatives.

    甘肃畜牧业实现了连续跃进
    杨复兴代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。现在，我就甘肃的畜牧业讲一点意见。畜牧业在甘肃国民经济中占有重要地位。两年来，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，随着国民经济的大跃进和人民公社化的实现，畜牧业也实现了连续跃进，取得了巨大成就。
    畜牧业的发展，带来了多方面的好处。首
  先，它给农业生产提供了肥料和动力。甘肃农业上需要的肥料，有40％以上是畜牧业供给的。同时，每年平均给农业上增加五万头左右的耕畜，有力地促进了农业的增产。其次，它给国家提供了工业原料和外贸物资，增加了国家积累。从1953年到1959年，全省畜牧业供应的羊毛、羊绒、猪鬃共有六十多万担，皮张七百多万张，还有大量的其他畜产品。第三、它给市场提供了大量的肉食和乳品，进一步丰富了广大人民的物质生活。第四、它促进了人民公社多种经济和商品生产的发展，既增加了公社的公共积累，又增加了社员的收入。第五、大大地繁荣了牧区经济和文化，增强了民族团结，提高了牧民的生活水平。这一点，我们藏族人民是体会得特别深刻的。
    大跃进以来，我们更深刻地认识到畜牧业和农业相互依存的关系，认识到它在整个国民经济和人民生活中的重要作用。特别是中央提出以养猪为中心，全面发展畜牧业的号召，更进一步地开阔了我们的眼界，提高了我们的认识。为了适应国民经济全面大跃进的新形势，高速度地发展畜牧业，已经成为我们当前的一项迫切任务。
    畜牧业生产的高速度发展，是完全可以办到的。甘肃有着发展畜牧业的良好自然条件，天然草原有十三万多平方公里，畜牧业又有比较悠久的历史，广大群众也积累了丰富的经验。更重要的是党的总路线和一套两条腿走路的方针，照亮了畜牧业高速度发展的道路；两年来工农业生产的大跃进，打下了雄厚的物质基础，对畜牧业的支援也大大加强了；农区和牧区人民公社的巩固和发展，为畜牧业开辟了广阔的天地。在这样空前有利的形势下，只要我们坚决依靠党的领导，贯彻执行“以猪为首，猪牛并重，全面地高速度地发展畜牧业，多养猪、多积肥、多打粮，支援农业高速度发展”的方针，在牧区以发展马牛羊为主，充分发挥广大群众的积极性和首创精神，大搞群众运动。我们就一定能够实现畜牧业的大跃进。
    事实上，两年来，甘肃不少地方的畜牧业已经获得了高速度发展。1959年，全省有九个县、市的畜牧业获得全面丰产。从1959年8月到12月的四个月内，全省生猪就增加了六十九万头，大家畜增加了二十九万头。全国养猪模范樊秀才领导的西礼县盐官公社套边生产队，1956年只有两头猪，经过1958年的大跃进，就猛增到一千三百多头，平均每户有十八头以上。环县的羊，从1958年的四十多万只，1959年增加到五十五万多只，增长率达到36％，全县平均每人有四只羊。山丹民乐公社常乐大队适龄母牛一百一十六头，1959年生了小牛一百一十七头，有一头生了两头小牛。在牧区，由于实现了人民公社化，一步登天，生产力大解放，畜牧业的面貌更是焕然一新。甘南藏族自治州从去年11月到今年3月，产羔二十六万多只，比去年同期增长将近一倍，成活率达到96％，比去年提高20％以上。百母超百羔的有三个生产队、一个牧场。目前全州大牲畜的适龄母畜，已经有90％怀了胎，保胎率达到95％。德乌鲁公社六十岁的藏族女饲养员刀吉姐饲养的二十二头母猪，从1958年9月到1959年9月，全部生了三胎，共产仔猪三百九十二头，增长了十七倍。肃南裕固族自治县1959年牲畜净增27％以上，其中猪增长85％，大牲畜增长15％。有了这些局部的大丰产，就能够发展成为全面的大跃进。据此，我们计划1960年全省牲畜总数要比1959年净增53％以上，其中猪净增两倍以上，大家畜净增12％以上。
    根据我们在实践中的体会，要高速度发展畜牧业，就要解决好繁殖、饲料、防疫、工具改革、饲养管理等关键性的问题。在这方面榆中县贡井公社中连川生产队已经创造了一套先进经验。这个队的养猪场贯彻勤俭办场的方针，自繁自养，选种育种，精心饲养，把母猪、孕猪、小猪、克郎猪、育肥猪分群管理，又按大小、强弱和吃食快慢，分槽喂养；实行定人、定时、定量、定地方、定位置，使猪的生活很有规律，很守秩序。在饲料方面，精粗适当搭配，采集野生饲料，利用农副产品和种植饲料作物相结合。同时，大搞工具改革，实现了饲料切碎机械化，饮水自流化，每人平均饲养一百五十到二百头猪。防疫卫生工作也很突出，做到了水净、槽净、料净、猪体净，并且定期注射，加强检疫。全场还建立了包仔猪繁殖成活、包膘分、包肥料和超产奖励的三包一奖制度。这个队在1956年六十头猪的基础上，现在已经发展到五千二百四十三头，增长了八十六倍。特别是由于养猪业的大发展，肥料大增加，农业获得了大增产。1958年这个队的猪增长了一点四倍，粮食增产了90％；1959年猪增长了将近两倍，粮食增产了两倍以上。中连川生产队不仅为养猪事业而且为整个畜牧业树立了一面多快好省的红旗。它的经验，正在全省范围内普遍推广。
    牧区的草原建设，是发展畜牧业的根本性措施。在甘南牧区，过去由于封建反动势力的统治和迷信思想的束缚，使不少牧场缺水衰败，有的甚至变为荒滩，给畜牧业的发展造成了很大困难。1958年反封建斗争和人民公社化运动的伟大胜利，一举而永远结束了这种局面，揭开草原建设的历史新页。去年冬季以来，开展了大兴草原水利的群众运动，修了一百一十五条渠道，有一百五十多万亩草原浇了水，预计可以增产牧草一倍以上。同时，进行了草原规划，试行了分区轮牧，使草原的使用更加合理。初步估计，载畜量至少可以增加十倍以上。广大牧民基本上定居下来，新的居民点正在开始修建。草原建设，不但促进畜牧业的大发展，而且从根本上改变广大牧民几千年来逐水草而居的游牧生活，促进牧区社会主义建设事业的全面跃进。这一切使我们深深感到，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们藏族人民翻了身，我们的牛羊发展了，我们的草原也茂盛了。
    高速度发展畜牧业的大好形势已经展现在我们面前，各民族人民多年来向往的“五谷丰登、六畜兴旺”的理想正在变为现实。让我们在伟大的中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛主席的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光荣旗帜，乘风破浪，奋勇前进！
    以上发言，不妥之处，请批评指正。最后，预祝大会胜利，祝全体代表健康。
