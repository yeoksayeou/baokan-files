    Taking Hygiene as an Honor
    Jiao Hewen
    In the old society, who was dirty and who was clean was not a matter of great importance. The laboring people lived in hunger and cold, struggling to survive, and couldn't afford to pay attention to hygiene. Peasants, due to the individualistic habits of the individual economy and poisoned by feudal superstitions of fatalism, could not view hygiene habits with a collectivist mindset that cared about "environmental sanitation," could not link their personal health with the interests of the state, strictly demand that they achieve "personal hygiene," nor could they understand hygiene knowledge with a scientific perspective. Only today is it possible to reverse this old view, change customs, and establish a social atmosphere of "taking hygiene as an honor."
    The day before yesterday, I went to Liutun Production Team of Shuangmiao Commune in Jiaohe County, a model hygiene village that has won many awards from Hebei Province. There is an old lady in this village named Wang Chunquan, a very ordinary old woman, who, due to her outstanding achievements in the "eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene" movement, was awarded the glorious title of "hygiene pacesetter," took the stage to receive the applause of the masses, the branch secretary gave her a big red flower, and she became a hygiene work cadre, showing her face in the village. Her family became a "glorious family," admired by everyone. The commune members said that paying attention to hygiene is a glorious thing. Because, first, if one family is not hygienic, it tarnishes the glorious title of the entire village as a "hygiene model" unit, affecting the collective honor; second, if one family is dirty, it is a breeding ground for bacteria, flying around and spreading everywhere, affecting environmental sanitation and harming everyone's health; third, if one is not hygienic oneself and gets sick, one cannot work, affecting production and harming socialist construction.
    Think about it, only in a socialist country, only people who love the collective, care about others, and have a communist spirit can launch such a large-scale movement in which everyone participates, working together to eliminate the four pests. The miracles of "fly-free cities," "four-without cities," and "four-without counties" demonstrate the ambition, perseverance, and Great Leap Forward style of the Chinese people, demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system, and demonstrate that the social landscape of our motherland is changing customs. Everyone cares about "environmental sanitation," caring about the health of others as much as they care about themselves; at the same time, they also care about "personal hygiene," caring about their own health. Whether it is oneself or others, the health of every one of the 600 million people in the country is beneficial to the socialist cause. Therefore, in the "eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene" movement, who wouldn't actively contribute to the health of others and oneself, to environmental sanitation and personal hygiene?

    以卫生为光荣
    焦合文
    在旧社会，谁脏谁净，是无关大体的。劳动人民的生活饥寒交迫，活命难保，顾不得讲究卫生。农民，由于个体经济各顾各的习惯，和受了宿命论的封建迷信毒害，不可能用关心“环境卫生”的集体主义思想看待卫生习惯，不可能把个人身体的康强和国家利益联系起来，严格要求自己做到“个人卫生”，也不可能用科学的眼光来理解卫生知识。只有到了今天，才有可能把这个旧观点扭过来，移风易俗，树立起“以卫生为光荣”的社会风尚。
    前天，我到了荣获河北省多次嘉奖的卫生模范村——交河县双庙公社刘屯生产队，这村有位王春权老大娘，是一位平平常常的老太太，由于在“除四害，讲卫生”运动中成绩突出，得到“卫生标兵”的光荣称号，登台接受群众的鼓掌，支书给挂大红花，当上了卫生工作干部，在村里出头露面，她家成了“光荣门第”，人人敬仰。社员们说讲卫生是件光荣事。因为，一，一家不卫生，给全村“卫生模范”单位的光荣称号抹灰，影响集体荣誉；二，一家脏了是细菌窝，到处飞扬散播，影响环境卫生，有害大家身体健康；三，自己不卫生，得了病不能出勤，影响生产，不利社会主义建设。
    想想吧，只有在社会主义制度的国家里，只有热爱集体、关心别人，具有共产主义风格的人们，才能展开这样大规模的人人动手、齐心合力的除四害运动。“无蝇城”、“四无城”、“四无县”的奇迹，表明了我国人民的雄心、毅力和大跃进的风格，表明了社会主义制度的优越性，表明了我们祖国的社会风貌正在移风易俗。人人关心“环境卫生”，像关心自己一样关心别人的身体健康；同时也关心“个人卫生”，关心自己的身体健康，无论自己或别人，全国六亿人民每个人的身体健康都是有益于社会主义事业的。因此，在“除四害，讲卫生”的运动中，谁还不为别人和自己的健康，谁还不为环境卫生和个人卫生积极出力呢？
