Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 21st: Seoul dispatch: The South Korean people are still persisting in their struggle against the fascist rule of the US-Syngman Rhee clique. The barbarous suppression and insidious methods of the US-Syngman Rhee clique have not been able to quell the anger of the masses who have risen up.

The situation in Seoul remains tense. Remote streets and the mountainous areas northeast of Seoul are still under the control of demonstrators. According to foreign newspapers, gunshots can be heard from there from time to time. The masses, armed with carbines and axes, continue to hold this area. At 6 p.m. yesterday, more than 2,000 people in a valley in the northwest suburbs of Seoul heroically resisted the suppression by Syngman Rhee's military police. According to the Toyo News Agency, about 150 students and citizens, including 80 armed people, continue to fight in the valley north of this place.

According to the World News Agency, 500 university students in Incheon held another demonstration at 12 o'clock today. The news said: Armed police attempted to forcibly disperse the students, but the students fought back against the police and marched toward the Donghwa Railway Station in Incheon. The students shouted slogans such as "Down with Syngman Rhee's reactionary rule!" At the same time, the Syngman Rhee group continues to intensify its brutal suppression. The army has established forts in many parts of Seoul. Seoul University and Korea University have been occupied by an infantry company and several tanks, respectively. Armed military police are constantly patrolling the city. Large-scale arrests are being carried out in Seoul. According to figures announced by the Seoul Police Bureau cited by Tonghwa News Agency, more than 1,040 citizens and students had been arrested as of last night. Among them, 343 people were arrested last night. All the hospitals in Seoul cannot accommodate the injured.

According to the reduced figures released for the first time today by the "Martial Law Command," on April 19 alone, the day the people's resistance action broke out, 111 people were shot dead and 561 were wounded by Syngman Rhee's puppet military police in Seoul, Busan, and Gwangju. Among them, 94 people were shot dead and 456 were wounded in Seoul.

Syngman Rhee's "Martial Law Command" has been saying that the whole country has "returned to calm," but at 5 a.m. this morning, he also issued an order prohibiting buses from running in Seoul. The "Martial Law Command" reduced the number of civilian vehicles running by half and prohibited vehicles from traveling to and from four districts in the city. They have closed the Seoul Railway Station and issued an order on the 20th prohibiting the people from going to the streets, ordering schools to close, and the "National Assembly" to cease activities. As the raging fire of the South Korean people's struggle violently shakes the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique, under the direction of the United States, is plotting to play some tricks to ease the people's struggle against the fascist rule of the US-Syngman Rhee clique.

According to foreign news agencies, all the "cabinet ministers" of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime collectively resigned this morning as scapegoats for the US-Syngman Rhee tyranny. In their resignation statements, these "ministers" said that they resigned because they were "responsible" for the recent demonstrations by the South Korean people.

At the same time, all members of the Standing Committee of Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party also resigned today.

The collective resignation of Syngman Rhee's "cabinet ministers" was announced after the US "Ambassador" McConaughy held a secret meeting with Syngman Rhee for more than an hour. The United States is propagating that it is demanding that Syngman Rhee "guarantee democratic rights," but in reality, it continues to support Syngman Rhee's reactionary rule with bayonets. The 15th Division of Syngman Rhee's puppet army, which carried out bloody massacres in Seoul these days, was sent back to Seoul from the armistice line by the US military command in Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 21st: More than 700,000 people in ten cities in northern Korea, including Wonsan, Kaesong, Haeju, Sinuiju, Hamhung, Chongjin, Kanggye, Sariwon, Nampo, and Hyesan, held rallies and demonstrations on the 20th to support the South Korean people's struggle against Syngman Rhee's fascist rule.

After the rallies, the people in these cities also held large-scale demonstrations. The slogans "Down with Syngman Rhee's reign of terror!" "US imperialists, get out of South Korea immediately!" and "Support the just struggle of the South Korean people!" resounded throughout northern Korea.

    李承晚在美国指使下一面加紧血腥镇压一面玩弄欺骗手法
    朝鲜北部七十万人集会声援南部同胞
    新华社平壤21日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜人民仍然在坚持反对美李集团法西斯统治的斗争。美李集团的野蛮镇压和阴险手段都没有能够平息揭竿而起的群众的怒火。
    汉城局势仍然很紧张。偏僻的街道和汉城东北的山区仍在示威者的控制中。据外国报纸报道，不时可以听到那儿传来的枪声。用卡宾枪和斧头武装起来的群众在继续坚守这个地区。昨天下午六时，在汉城西北郊外山谷中，两千多人英勇地抵抗李承晚的军警对他们的镇压。据东洋通讯社消息，在这个地方以北的山谷中，大约有一百五十个学生和市民，其中包括八十个有武装的人继续斗争。
    据世界通讯社报道，仁川的五百名大学生在今天十二时再次举行示威。消息说：武装警察企图用武力驱散学生，但是学生对警察进行还击，向仁川的东火车站前进。学生们高呼打倒李承晚反动统治的口号。同时，李承晚集团继续在加紧残暴镇压。陆军已在汉城市的许多地方建立了防寨。汉城大学和高丽大学已分别为一个步兵连和几辆坦克所占领。武装宪兵不断在市内巡逻。汉城正在进行大规模的逮捕。据同和通讯社援引汉城市警察局宣布的数字，到昨天晚上为止有一千零四十多个市民和学生被逮捕。其中有三百四十三人是在昨晚被逮捕的。汉城所有的医院都容纳不下受伤的人。
    据“戒严司令部”今天第一次发表的缩小的数字，仅在人民抵抗行动爆发的4月19日一天，汉城、釜山和光州被李伪军警开枪打死的有一百十一人，打伤五百六十一人。其中在汉城被打死的有九十四人，打伤的有四百五十六人。
    李承晚的“戒严司令部”一直在说全国各地已经“恢复平静”，但是在今天上午五时他还发布命令，禁止汉城的公共汽车通行。“戒严司令部”把行驶的民用车辆减少一半，并且禁止城内四个区的车辆的来往。他们已经关闭了汉城火车站，并且在20日发布命令禁止老百姓上街，命令学校停课，“国会”停止活动。由于南朝鲜人民燎原烈火般的斗争剧烈地动摇着李承晚傀儡政权，在血腥镇压的同时，李承晚卖国集团正在美国的指使下阴谋玩弄一些手段，来缓和人民反对美李集团法西斯统治的斗争。
    据外国通讯社报道，李承晚傀儡政权的所有“内阁部长”今天上午集体辞职，作为美李暴政的替罪羊。这些“部长”们在辞职的声明中说，他们辞职的原因是对南朝鲜人民最近的示威“负有责任”。
    同时，李承晚的自由党的常任委员会全体委员也在今天辞职。
    李承晚的“内阁部长”的集体辞职是在美国“大使”麦康瑙吉同李承晚进行了一个多小时的秘密会谈以后宣布的。美国正在宣传它在要求李承晚“保障民主权利”，但是，在实际上它继续在用刺刀支持李承晚的反动统治，这几天在汉城进行血腥屠杀的李伪军第十五师团就是由侵朝美军司令部从停战线派回汉城的。
    据新华社平壤21日电　朝鲜北部元山、开城、海州、新义州、咸兴、清津、江界、沙里院、南浦、惠山等十个城市共七十多万人20日纷纷举行集会和示威游行，声援南朝鲜人民反对李承晚法西斯统治的斗争。
    这些城市的人民集会后还举行了大规模的示威游行。“打倒李承晚恐怖统治！”“美帝国主义者立即从南朝鲜滚出去！”“支持南朝鲜人民的正义斗争”的口号声响遍朝鲜北部。
