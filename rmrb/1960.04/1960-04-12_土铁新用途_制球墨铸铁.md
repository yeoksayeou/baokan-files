New Use for Indigenous Iron—Manufacturing Nodular Cast Iron

(Our dispatch) The Tianjin North China Sewing Machine Factory has successfully used high-sulfur white indigenous iron to produce "indigenous" nodular cast iron. Currently, about 20% of the steel parts in the factory's shoe sole machines are manufactured using "indigenous" nodular cast iron. This saves forty tons of steel for every ten thousand shoe sole machines produced. Furthermore, by substituting casting for forging, production cycles have been shortened, and production efficiency has been improved. Using "indigenous" nodular cast iron for just four parts of the shoe sole machine can save 260,000 work hours per ten thousand machines. Costs have also been greatly reduced. For example, the unit cost of a shoe sole machine in December of last year was 176 yuan, but since January of this year, it has been reduced to 86 yuan.

    土铁新用途—制球墨铸铁
    本报讯　天津华北缝纫机厂用高硫白口土铁制成“土”球墨铸铁。现在，这个厂生产的鞋底机已有20％左右的钢制零件采用“土”球墨铸铁来制造，每一万台鞋底机可以节省四十吨钢材；由于以铸代锻，缩短了生产周期，提高了生产效率。仅鞋底机四个零件用“土”球墨铸铁生产，每万台就可以节约二十六万个工时。成本也大为降低。如鞋底机单位成本在去年12月是一百七十六元，从今年1月份起，已降低到八十六元。
