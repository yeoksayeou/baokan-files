    The Rebirth of the "Grassland"
    Deputy Su Xin Introduces the Development of Animal Husbandry Production in Ruo'ergai County, Aba Autonomous Prefecture
    I fully agree with and support the report on the draft 1960 national economic plan made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun and the report on the 1959 national final accounts and the draft 1960 national budget made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and I will resolutely implement them in future work.
    Now I will report on the development of animal husbandry production in Ruo'ergai County, Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province:
        Basic realization of cooperation
    Ruo'ergai is a county located on the grasslands of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, more than 3,000 meters above sea level, and is basically a pastoral area. This once-difficult grassland that the Red Army passed through during the Long March has completely changed today. After the victory of the democratic reform in 1958, the socialist transformation of animal husbandry was carried out immediately, and cooperation was basically realized. A total of 77 primary pastoral (agricultural) production cooperatives and 11 advanced cooperatives were established in the county, with the number of pastoral (agricultural) households joining the cooperatives reaching 83.4% of the total number of pastoral (agricultural) households, and the number of livestock joining the cooperatives accounting for 90.2% of the total number of livestock owned by the pastoral (agricultural) households joining the cooperatives. At the same time, socialist transformation was carried out on the 74 herdsman owners and 160 rich herdsmen, accounting for 6.6% of the total number of herdsmen households in the county (they owned a total of 130,000 head of livestock, accounting for 38% of the total number of livestock in the county), through the two forms of joint state-private operation and joint cooperative-private operation. Because the feudal slave system was completely destroyed, the productive forces were liberated, and the organized masses of herdsmen and laborers were full of energy, the pastoral and agricultural production quickly developed greatly.
    In 1959 (the first year after the victory of democratic reform and cooperation), under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the pastoral (agricultural) people of the whole county, in accordance with the policy of "mainly animal husbandry, supplemented by sideline occupations, gradually realizing the integration of agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations" determined by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, under the direct leadership of the Aba Prefectural Committee, mobilized the broad masses, overcame various disasters, and realized an all-round bumper harvest in pastoral, sideline, and agricultural production. The total number of livestock (including cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses) in the county developed to 375,000 head (excluding slaughter, elimination, and mortality), a net increase of 36,415 head, an increase of more than 10% compared with the great leap forward in 1958. The output of livestock products has also greatly increased. The amount of butter refined from every 100 jin of milk increased from 5 jin to 6 jin to 6.5 jin, an increase of 20% to 30%; the total output of butter increased from 1.2 million jin in the great leap forward in 1958 to 1.5 million jin, an increase of 20%; the total output of wool increased to 375,000 jin, an increase of 25% compared with the great leap forward in 1958.
          Starting to practice intensive farming
    The agricultural production in the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of the county has basically changed the past habit of extensive cultivation with low yields, and has begun to practice intensive farming with multiple high yields. Last year, the total grain output of the county reached 13.45 million jin, more than doubling the total output of 6.5 million jin in the great leap forward in 1958. It is particularly worth mentioning that in the Dazha Advanced Cooperative in the pure pastoral area with an altitude of 3,500 meters, where no crops had ever been grown in the past, this situation was changed last year, and 43 mu of grain crops were successfully trial-planted, of which 32 mu of highland barley averaged 220 jin per mu, and the 10 mu with the highest yield averaged 370 jin per mu. The success of growing grain and obtaining high yields in high-altitude pastoral areas is of great significance. It not only refutes the erroneous argument that "the frost-free period in the grassland is short, the climate is harsh, and grain cannot grow at all," but also opens up a broad prospect for gradually implementing settled grazing and integrating agriculture and animal husbandry.
    Last year, the sideline occupations and diversified operations in the county also developed greatly. With the development of production, the income of the masses also increased. According to the results of the final accounts distribution last winter, 88 cooperatives in the county greatly increased production, and 95% of the members increased their income. For example, the total income of animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and agriculture in Axi Township in 1959 was 112,635 yuan, an increase of 57% compared with the special great leap forward in 1958 (total income of more than 71,000 yuan), of which the income of poor herdsmen increased by 71% compared with 1958, the income of middle herdsmen increased by 58%, and the income of upper herdsmen increased by 29%. Another example is the 92 members of the Dazha Advanced Cooperative. Before the democratic reform and the establishment of the cooperative, more than 80% of the poor herdsmen could not maintain their lives, and most people had to go out to beg for a living in winter. Last year, the average income of each member household was 450 yuan. In winter, 80% of the members added cotton clothes and quilts and other daily necessities, and more than 90% of the members deposited money in the bank. For example, the family of four of member Ba Mu had two people participating in labor last year, with an income of more than 500 yuan. After expenses, they also deposited more than 130 yuan in the bank. She said with great emotion: "In the past, helping others all year round, let alone clothes, even a family wanting to drink thin gruel and eat barley cakes was impossible; now not only do we have food, clothing, and shelter, but also money to deposit in the bank. This is the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the benefits brought by the cooperative."
    Through last winter's final accounts distribution and socialist education, the broad masses of members further recognized the superiority of the cooperative, and their socialist consciousness was greatly enhanced, resulting in a new upsurge in production. Last year, the survival rate of lambs reached 96.1%, with more than 91,000 head (the highest survival rate in the past was 50% to 60%); in some places, the survival rate reached 99%. The whole county has generally implemented the separation of the six types of livestock: male, female, old, weak, young, and pregnant; the isolation of sick livestock; the distant grazing of strong livestock; and the housing of the three types of livestock, young livestock, and breeding livestock in sheds and pens, with the addition of night feed and salt. In terms of mating, the whole county has basically realized full mating and pregnancy, reaching 90% for cattle, 85% for horses, and 95% for sheep. Many cooperatives have broken with conventions and are working hard for Tibetan sheep to give birth to twins in one year. They have put forward the slogan "Boost morale, fight three battles, and double the output of animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and agriculture," and are striving to achieve a great leap forward in production in 1960.
          Realizing that every township has a primary school
    With the development of production and the increase in the income of members, the masses urgently demanded to learn culture. There was not a single primary school in the county before the reform. In 1959, it was realized that "every township has a primary school," and the number of children enrolled reached more than 60% of the total number of school-age children. Key trials were also conducted on spare-time night schools for young adults and newspaper reading groups. In order to overcome the difficulty of language barriers and improve their cultural knowledge more quickly, they all first asked to start learning Chinese and singing, whether in primary school or night school. In just half a year, most students have learned generally used Chinese, and many people can sing songs such as "The East is Red" and "Socialism is Good." In 1959, more than half of the townships in the county established health stations, and every cooperative established a veterinary disease prevention and control team, organizing a total of 205 local Tibetan doctors and local veterinarians to treat diseases for people and livestock. Some of them have quite high technical levels, and the cured livestock diseases are more than 90%. The trend of paying attention to hygiene and preventing diseases has begun to be established among the masses.
    The facts of the great leap forward last year made the broad masses of pastoral (agricultural) people realize from their personal experience that without the Communist Party, without Chairman Mao, and without socialism, there would be no great leap forward and no bumper harvest. Therefore, they sincerely compared the Party and Chairman Mao to the "golden sun" and the "guiding benefactor," praised "socialism is happiness," compared the cadres sent by the Party to the "brothers sent by Chairman Mao," and enthusiastically paid agricultural taxes. In many places, the tasks were all overfulfilled in three or four days, and some even in one day. In the big family of cooperation, the masses cooperated with each other. For example, in the relocation of tents, the harvesting of winter grass, and the protection of livestock mating, many moving examples of mutual help and cooperation emerged. This shows that even in pastoral areas, under the leadership of the Party and the brilliant light of the general line, the relationship between people and between nationalities has also undergone new changes.
    The above achievements are the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the victory of the Party's policies and principles for ethnic minority areas.
    Of course, we cannot be satisfied with this. If the poor and blank face of the whole country has not been fundamentally changed, then the poorer and blanker face of our ethnic minority areas needs to be changed even more. The land in the grassland areas is fertile, and there are still large areas of virgin land and rich material wealth waiting to be developed. This requires us to catch up quickly, further mobilize the masses, and resolutely continue to implement the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China's production policy of "mainly animal husbandry, supplemented by sideline occupations, gradually realizing the integration of agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations," continue to exert great effort, strive for the upper reaches, and strive to change the poor and blank backward face of the pastoral areas as soon as possible. To this end, on the basis of the great leap forward in the past two years, this year the whole county will further vigorously develop various livestock; strive to basically achieve self-sufficiency in grain this year; continue to develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings, eliminate illiteracy, and eliminate diseases. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command and carrying out mass movements on a large scale, we will definitely be able to realize the continued great leap forward this year and achieve greater victories in the all-round bumper harvest of animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and agriculture.

    “草地”的新生
    苏新代表介绍阿坝自治州若尔盖县畜牧业生产发展情况
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理所作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告，并在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    现在我把四川省阿坝藏族自治州若尔盖县畜牧业生产发展的情况汇报一下：
        基本上实现了合作化
    若尔盖是在阿坝藏族自治州草原上、海拔三千多公尺的一个县，基本上是牧业地区。这个过去红军长征时经过的困苦草原，今天完全变了样。1958年民主改革胜利以后，紧接着对畜牧业进行了社会主义改造，基本上实现了合作化。全县共建立了初级牧（农）业生产合作社七十七个，高级社十一个，入社牧（农）户达到总牧（农）户的83.4％，入社牲畜占入社牧（农）户牲畜总头数的90.2％。同时对占全县总牧户6.6％的七十四户牧主和一百六十户富牧的经济（他们共拥有十三万头牲畜，占全县牲畜总头数38％）采取公私合营和社私合营两种形式进行了社会主义改造。由于彻底摧毁了封建奴隶制度，解放了生产力，组织起来的牧民劳动群众干劲冲天，因而牧业和农业生产很快就大大发展起来了。
    1959年（即民主改革胜利和合作化后的第一年），全县牧（农）民在党的社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，遵照中共四川省委确定的
  “以牧为主，牧副并举，逐步实现农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针，在阿坝州委的直接领导下，发动广大群众，战胜了各种灾害，实现牧、副、农业生产的全面大丰收。全县牲畜（包括牛、羊、猪、马）总头数发展到三十七万五千头（除去宰杀、淘汰和死亡数）净增三万六千四百一十五头，比大跃进的1958年增长了百分之十点多。畜产品的产量也有很大增加，每百斤牛奶提炼酥油的数量由五斤增加为六斤至六斤半，增长了20％至30％，酥油总产量由大跃进的1958年的一百二十万斤增加到一百五十万斤，增长20％；羊毛总产量增加到三十七万五千斤，比大跃进的1958年增长25％。
          开始实行精耕细作
    全县半农半牧区的农业生产，已经基本上改变了过去耕作粗放，广种薄收的习惯，开始实行精耕细作、多种高产多收。去年全县粮食总产量达到一千三百四十五万斤，比大跃进的1958年总产量六百五十万斤，翻了一番多。特别值得提出的是在拔海三千五百公尺的纯牧区的达扎高级社，过去从没有种过庄稼的，去年改变了这种情况，试种成功了四十三亩粮食作物，其中有三十二亩青稞平均亩产达到二百二十斤，产量最高的十亩，平均亩产达三百七十斤。在高山的牧区种粮食成功并且获得高产，这个事实具有很大的意义。它不仅驳倒了那种所谓“草原无霜期短，气候恶劣，根本不能生长粮食”的错误论点，而且为逐步实行定居放牧和农牧相结合的办法，开辟了生产广阔发展的前途。
    去年全县的副业和多种经营也有很大的发展。随着生产的发展，群众的收入也增加了。去年冬天决算分配的结果，全县有八十八个合作社大大地增了产、95％的社员增加了收入。如阿西乡1959年牧、副、农业总收入为十一万二千六百三十五元，较特大跃进的1958年（总收入七万一千多元）增长了57％，其中贫苦牧民的收入比1958年增长71％，中等牧民的收入增长了58％，上等牧民的收入增长了29％。又如达扎高级社九十二户社员，民主改革和建社以前，80％以上的贫苦牧民无法维持生活，冬季大多数人要出去乞讨度日。去年每户社员平均收入四百五十元，冬天80％的社员添置了棉衣棉被等生活日用品，90％以上的社员在银行存了款。如社员八母一家四口，去年她家有两个人参加了劳动，收入达五百多元，除开支外，还存入银行一百三十多元。她很感动地说：“过去帮人，一年到头，莫说穿的，就是一家人要想喝稀汤汤?粑都不行；现在不但有吃的、穿的、住的，还有钱存银行。这是共产党和毛主席的恩情，合作社带来的好处。”
    经过去冬决算分配和社会主义教育，广大社员进一步认识了合作社的优越性，社会主义觉悟大大提高，出现新的生产高潮。去年羊羔成活率达到96.1％，有九万一千多头（过去成活率最高是50％至60％）；有的地方成活率达到99％。全县较普遍的实行了公、母、老、弱、幼、孕六畜分群，病畜隔离，壮畜远牧，三类畜、幼畜及种畜都住棚圈，加喂夜饲料和盐巴。在配种方面，全县基本上实现了全配满怀，牛达到90％，马达到85％，羊达到95％。不少的社打破常规，为藏系绵羊一年生双胎而努力。他们提出了“鼓干劲、战三关、牧副农业齐加番”，为实现1960年的生产大跃进而奋斗。
          实现了乡乡有小学
    随着生产的发展和社员收入的增加，群众迫切要求学习文化。全县在改革以前没有一所小学。1959年实现了“乡乡有小学”，入学儿童达到学龄儿童总数的60％以上，还重点试办了青壮年业余夜校、读报小组。他们为了克服语言不通的困难，更快地提高文化知识，不论小学和夜校，他们都首先要求从学汉语和学唱歌作起。仅半年的时间，多数学生已经学会了一般通用的汉语，许多人都可以唱“东方红”，“社会主义好”的歌曲。1959年全县有半数以上的乡办起了保健站，社社成立起兽疫防治小组，共组织当地的藏医和土兽医二百零五人，为人畜治病，有的技术水平相当高，治好的畜病在90％以上。现在讲卫生、防疾病的风气已经开始在群众中树立起来。
    去年大跃进的事实，使广大牧（农）民从他们亲身体验中认识到没有共产党，没有毛主席，没有社会主义，就没有大跃进、大丰收。因此，他们衷心地把党和毛主席比作“金色太阳”、“引路恩人”，歌颂“社会主义是幸福”，把党派去的干部比作“毛主席派来的兄弟”并且踊跃交纳农业税。很多地方在三四天，有的甚至在一天之内即全部超额完成任务。在合作化的大家庭里，群众互相协作，如在迁移帐房、收割冬草和保畜配种中，都出现了许多互相帮助，彼此协作的动人的事例。这说明就是在牧业地区，在党的领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，人与人之间和民族之间的关系也起了新的变化。
    上述这些成绩的取得，是党的社会主义总路线的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是党对少数民族地区方针政策的胜利。
    当然，我们还不能以此为满足。如果说：全国一穷二白的面貌还没有得到根本的改变，那么我们少数民族地区更穷更白的面貌就更需要加以改变。草原地区的土地肥沃、还有大片的处女地和蕴藏着丰富的物质财富需待开发出来。这就要求我们急起直追，进一步发动群众，坚决继续贯彻执行中共四川省委“以牧为主、牧副并举，逐步实现农牧结合、发展多种经营”的生产方针，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，为尽快地改变牧区一穷二白落后面貌而奋斗。为此，我们必须在前两年大跃进的基础上，今年全县要进一步大力发展各种牲畜；力争今年粮食实现基本自给；继续发展文教卫生事业，扫除文盲，消除病害。我们坚信，在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，我们一定能够实现今年的继续大跃进，取得牧、副、农业全面大丰收的更大胜利。
