Comrades of the Presidium, esteemed representatives:

I fully endorse the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and will resolutely implement them. I will now briefly report to the congress on the profound changes that have taken place in our "July 1st" Management District in recent years, especially since the establishment of the people's commune.

The "July 1st" Management District of the Sifangtai People's Commune in Suihua County was a notorious "Impoverished Sun Family Gully" before liberation. Feudal landlords carried out cruel exploitation, and the people lived in utter misery. After liberation, the Party led the peasant masses in carrying out land reform, overthrowing the landlords, and the poor people were given land and became masters of the land. After that, in order to rapidly develop agricultural production and continuously improve the people's lives, mutual aid teams, elementary cooperatives, and advanced cooperatives were established one after another. These agricultural production organizations all played their due role in various historical periods. The comprehensive and rapid development of the rural economy made us increasingly feel that the original organizational form and management scope of the advanced cooperatives were no longer suitable. At this moment, the Party Central Committee issued the great call to establish people's communes. In 1958, the peasants of the entire management district participated in the Sifangtai People's Commune with incomparable excitement.

The results of two years of practice have proven that the people's commune, this new organizational form, has incomparable superiority, and it is a broad road for our countryside to advance towards communism. This can be fully proven by the development and changes in our management district after communization.

The most obvious change in our management district after the people's commune was the rapid development of agricultural production and the gradual increase in the income of commune members. Communization has given the peasant masses unparalleled strength. Things that they did not dare to think about in the past, they now dare to think and do. After communization, the amount of labor used in the bumper harvest more than doubled. Thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members, the autumn harvest was carried out quickly and well, completing the task more than 30 days ahead of schedule. In the midst of the intense autumn harvest, more than 17,000 workdays were also used to jointly build two large reservoirs with neighboring management districts, benefiting an area of ​​5,000 hectares. At the same time, more than 600 hectares of land were deeply plowed, accounting for 93.4% of the total cultivated land area in the management district, and the fields were fully fertilized. The comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" has led to a gradual increase in grain output and a continuous increase in the income of commune members. Five years ago, the normal yield of our management district was 2,400 catties per hectare. In 1955, during the advanced cooperative stage, it was 4,500 catties, and in 1959, after communization, it increased to 5,100 catties. The amount of grain sold to the state was 780,000 catties in 1955, and 1,840,000 catties in 1959. The total income of commune members in 1955 was 136,000 yuan, with an average income of 210 yuan per labor force and an average income of 67 yuan per person. In 1959, the total income of commune members reached 267,000 yuan, with an average income of 560 yuan per labor force and an average income of 117 yuan per person. The average income per person has increased significantly compared to 1955, not to mention compared to the previous years with even lower incomes.

Another major change after communization is that our management district has jumped out of the category of simply managing agriculture. While developing agricultural production, industry, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery have all been greatly developed. In 1959, more than 30,000 yuan was allocated from the net income of diversified operations to subsidize agriculture. After communization, our management district has adopted the method of relying on the masses, everyone working together, and self-reliance, and has built eight factories for rice milling, brick making, tile making, clothing, iron and wood repair, and brewing. It has also established a pig farm with more than 300 sows, an orchard with 11 hectares of land, and a forest farm with 57 hectares of land. In terms of fishery, it has jointly managed two reservoirs with nine management districts, raising 150,000 fish. Due to the development of production and increased income, we have also bought two tractors and established a thermal power plant. The area of ​​mechanized land has reached more than 60%, and the electricity for production and life has been basically resolved.

After communization, due to the rapid development of production, various welfare undertakings have also correspondingly followed up, which is also an extremely obvious major change. Our management district has established eight nurseries, five canteens, and one primary and secondary school each. All school-age children have been enrolled, all children have been admitted to nurseries, and most commune members eat in canteens, freeing the vast number of women from heavy housework and allowing them to participate in social labor. The improvement of living standards is also reflected in the improvement of living conditions. According to the requirements of brick and tile roofing of rural houses, we have adopted the method of "publicly-run and privately-invested" (the commune provides bricks, tiles, and labor, with a price of 150 yuan per room, which is deducted in installments), taking materials locally, and everyone working together through self-reliance. Two hundred and four brick and tile houses have been built in the management district. Now 30% of farmers have moved into new houses, and the remaining 70% of farmers also live in spacious main houses with sufficient sunlight. It is planned to fully realize brick and tile roofing of houses within three years. Now every household in the entire management district has installed electric lights, realizing lighting without oil. Commune members' lives are getting better and better. The masses said: "Living in brick houses and lighting electric lights makes us happier the more we think about it. It feels like two doors have been opened in our hearts, and we feel energetic all over." They recalled the past: "Small shacks, broken outbuildings, north and south kangs, three generations sleep on one kang in one room, lacking food and fuel and no clothes, a year's work is in vain, poor brothers are heartbroken." Now it is: "New streets, red brick houses, painted doors and glass windows, electric lights and machines are loud, everyone's face is full of joy. If you ask where happiness comes from, thanks to the savior Communist Party, future happiness is boundless."

The profound changes in our management district are also reflected in the fact that while the rural economic outlook is changing day by day, the people's spiritual and cultural outlook has also greatly changed. Through socialist education, the general line education, and a series of political and ideological education movements such as rectification and anti-rightist campaigns, the ideological awareness of the vast number of commune members has been greatly improved, and the communist style has been greatly promoted. Always following the Party, listening to the Party, and never leaving the broad road of socialism and communism has become the firm belief of the vast number of commune members. It is precisely because of the improvement of awareness that the enthusiasm for production has been greatly enhanced. Once the leaders put forward any heavy and difficult tasks, the commune members will respond in droves, with full energy and high morale, and many tasks are completed ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota. In terms of culture, not only school-age children are enrolled, but also illiteracy among commune members has been basically eliminated. Now many people who did not know a single word in the past can read books and newspapers, write letters and articles. In short, the era of poverty, backwardness, and "Impoverished Sun Family Gully" is gone forever.

The profound changes that have taken place in our "July 1st" Management District in recent years, especially after the people's commune, fully prove the unparalleled correctness of the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and clearly demonstrate that the "three magic weapons" of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune have strong vitality and unparalleled power. We have not done enough work, and it is not good enough. There is still a distance from the requirements and expectations of the Party. In the future, we must redouble our efforts, resolutely under the leadership of the Party, hold high the red flag of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, and strive for the further improvement and consolidation of the people's commune, and for the construction of a prosperous, happy, and beautiful new countryside.

I wish the congress a complete success, and I wish all representatives good health!

    “穷孙家沟”的时代一去不复返了
    王喜明代表谈绥化县四方台公社  “七一”管理区几年来的巨大变化主席团、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念两位副总理所作的报告，并要坚决贯彻执行。现在将我们“七一”管理区几年来，特别是人民公社建立后所发生的深刻变化向大会作一简要汇报。
    绥化县四方台人民公社“七一”管理区，解放前是个有名的“穷孙家沟”，封建地主剥削惨重，人民生活苦不堪言。解放后，党领导农民群众进行了土地改革，打倒了地主，穷人分得土地翻了身，农民才当上土地的主人。此后，为了迅速发展农业生产，不断地提高人民生活，又先后建立了互助组、初级社和高级社，这些农业生产组织，都在各个历史时期中发挥了它应有的作用。农村经济的全面迅速发展，使我们越来越感到原来高级社的组织形式和经营范围已不能与之相适应。恰在此时，党中央发出了建立人民公社的伟大号召，全管理区农民在1958年，以无比兴奋的心情，参加了四方台人民公社。
    两年实践结果证明，人民公社这一新的组织形式有着无比的优越性，它是我们农村通向共产主义的一条康庄大道。这从我们管理区公社化后的发展变化情况完全可以得到证明。
    我们管理区，人民公社化后的明显变化，首先表现在农业生产迅速发展，社员收入逐渐增加。公社化给农民群众增加了无比力量，过去不敢想的事情、现在也敢想敢干了。公社化后，由于大丰收在用工数量上增加了一倍还多，由于广大社员发挥了冲天干劲，秋收搞得又快又好，提前三十多天完成任务。并在紧张秋收中，还用一万七千多个劳动日与邻近管理区联合修建成两个较大水库，受益面积达五千多垧；与此同时还深翻了六百多垧土地，占全管理区耕地总面积的93.4％，并达到了粪满田。农业“八字宪法”的全面贯彻，使粮食产量逐年有所增加，社员收入不断增加。五年前我们管理区正常年景是垧产二千四百斤，1955年高级社阶段是四千五百斤，公社化后的1959年增加到五千一百斤。卖给国家的粮食，1955年是七十八万斤，而1959年则为一百八十四万斤。1955年社员总收入为十三万六千元，每个劳动力平均收入二百一十元，每口人平均收入为六十七元。而1959年社员总收入达二十六万七千元，每个劳动力平均收入五百六十元，每口人平均收入为一百一十七元。每口人的平均收入较1955年有了显著的增长。更不用同收入更少的前些年相比了。
    公社化后的另一个重大变化是：我们管理区已经跳出了仅仅经营农业的范畴，在发展农业生产的同时，工、林、牧、副、渔等业都有了很大发展。1959年从多种经营的纯收入中拨款补助农业三万多元。公社化后我们管理区采取依靠群众、大家动手、自力更生的办法，已经建起碾米、制砖、制瓦、被服、铁木修理以及酿酒等八个工厂，还建立了一个有三百多口母猪的养猪场、有十一垧地的果园和有五十七垧地的林场，渔业方面同九个管理区联合经营了两个水库，养十五万尾鱼。由于生产发展，收入增加，我们还买了两台拖拉机，建立了火力发电站，机耕土地面积已达60％多，生产和生活用电已基本上得到解决。
    公社化后，由于生产的迅速发展，各种生活福利事业也随着相应地跟上来，这也是异常明显的重大变化。我们管理区建立了八个托儿所，五个食堂，中小学各一处，适龄儿童已经全部入学，幼儿全部入托，大部社员到食堂就餐，使广大妇女摆脱了繁重的家务，参加了社会劳动。生活的改善也表现在居住条件的改善上。根据农村房屋砖瓦化的要求，我们采取“公办私投”（社里供给砖瓦、人工，每间价一百五十元，分期扣回），就地取材，大家动手，自力更生的办法，已在管理区建起二百零四间砖瓦房，现在已有30％的农户迁入新居，其余70％的农户也住的是阳光充足宽阔的正房，计划在三年内全部实现房屋砖瓦化。现在全管理区已家家安上了电灯，实现了点灯不用油，社员日子越过越好。群众说：“住砖房，点电灯，越想越高兴，心里好像开了两扇门似的，觉得浑身是劲”。他们回忆过去是：小马架，破厢房，南北炕，一间房三辈人睡一床（炕），缺吃少烧没衣裳，干一年都白忙，穷哥们伤心肠。现在是：新街道，红砖房，油漆门户玻璃窗，电灯、机器响，人人脸上喜洋洋，要问幸福那里来，多亏救星共产党，今后的幸福乐无疆。
    我们管理区发生深刻变化还表现在：在农村经济面貌日益改观的同时，人们的精神文化面貌也大有改变。经过社会主义教育，总路线教育，以及整风、反右等一系列政治思想教育运动，广大社员的思想觉悟大大提高，共产主义风尚大大发扬。永远跟着党走，听党的话，决不离开社会主义、共产主义这条康庄大道已成为广大社员坚定不移的信念。正是由于觉悟的提高，也促进了生产积极性的大大增强，任何繁重困难的任务，领导一经提出，社员即群起响应，干劲充沛，斗志昂扬，许多任务都提前超额完成。在文化方面，不仅适龄儿童得到就学，社员中的文盲也已经基本消除，现在已有不少过去一字不识的人，能够看书看报、写信写稿。总之，贫穷，落后，“穷孙家沟”的时代已经一去不复返了。
    我们“七一”管理区几年来，特别是人民公社化后所发生的深刻变化，充分证明了党中央和毛主席领导的无比正确性，鲜明地显示出总路线、大跃进、人民公社这“三大法宝”具有强大的生命力和无比的力量。我们所作的工作还不够多，还不尽好，同党的要求和希望还有距离。今后，我们定要加倍努力，坚决在党的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，为人民公社的进一步健全和巩固，为建设繁荣、幸福、美丽的新农村而奋斗。
    祝大会胜利成功，祝各位代表身体健康！
