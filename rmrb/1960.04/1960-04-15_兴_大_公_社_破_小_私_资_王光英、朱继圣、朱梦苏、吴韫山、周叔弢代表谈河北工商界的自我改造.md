Comrades Representatives:

We completely agree with and support the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, and will resolutely implement them in our work.

The reports of the three Vice Premiers summarize the tremendous achievements of 1959 and showcase the magnificent and splendid prospects for the continued comprehensive leap forward of the national economy in 1960 and the sustained leap forward throughout the 1960s. This great and inspiring new situation brings extremely favorable conditions for us in the industrial and commercial circles to further accept socialist transformation, and at the same time, puts forward the requirements for us to serve better and transform better.

The Hebei Province's democratic construction (Minjian) and Federation of Industry and Commerce (Gongshanglian) organizations at all levels, due to the implementation of the Party's guiding principle of taking political thought as the command, labor practice as the foundation, and enterprises or work posts as the base, and combining the three, and using the mass self-education comparison method to promote all industrial and commercial figures in combination with personal transformation plans, to summarize the practice of service and transformation on schedule, and to carry out comparisons with the content of comparing transformation, comparing contribution, comparing labor, and comparing learning, to elect activists who accept socialist transformation and serve socialism, to establish advanced banners, and to influence and drive the general; and on this basis, to set off a socialist competition of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping. This work has been carried out for two years since 1958 and has achieved significant results. Taking the situation in Tianjin as an example, the activists elected in 1959 accounted for more than 14% of the total number of industrial and commercial figures in the city, an increase of more than 50% compared to 9.3% in 1958, and the content quality of the typical deeds of activists serving and transforming has also been greatly improved compared to 1958.

Not long ago, the Minjian and Gongshanglian convened a National Congress of Representatives. The leaders of the Party Central Committee pointed out that the industrial and commercial circles have made great progress in the past year or so, but have not advanced to the point where the majority of people have solved or basically solved the political stance, so they must continue to transform. At the same time, it also clearly pointed out the direction of future efforts; earnestly instructed us to "take care of one end," the end of national interests and people's interests, "lean to one side," lean to the side of socialism. It taught us to unremittingly strengthen self-remolding from production practice and social practice; and at the same time as practice, earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, and remold the political stance and world outlook. Therefore, making up our minds, establishing aspirations, taking care of one end, leaning to one side, wholeheartedly listening to Chairman Mao's words, wholeheartedly following the Communist Party, wholeheartedly accepting transformation, and wholeheartedly serving socialism, and making more contributions to the interests of the country and the people, is the most critical and fundamental issue in the transformation of our industrial and commercial figures. The Tianjin Minjian and Gongshanglian organizations, in order to actively promote the city's industrial and commercial figures to resolutely follow the Party's teachings, conscientiously conveyed and implemented the spirit and resolutions of the National Congress of Representatives of the Minjian and Gongshanglian, and further set off a new upsurge of service to socialism for the city's industrial and commercial figures. We adopted flexible and diverse methods of conveying, implementing, exchanging experiences, learning, and acting simultaneously, and carried out the work of gentle breeze and fine rain, and mass self-education. Because we resolutely relied on the leadership of the Party, implemented the mass line, and carried out extensive mobilization and full preparation work, we were able to conduct 116 large, medium, and small meetings in seven days, organizing more than 13,000 people (a total of 50,000 person-times) to participate in the meetings. Because the meetings moved together both inside and outside, more than 90% of the city's industrial and commercial figures were generally inspired and educated.

Mountains are changing, waters are changing, everything is changing, if you don't change yourself, you will fall behind

The teachings and instructions of the leaders of the Party Central Committee, after transmission and discussion, enabled the comrades attending the meeting to have a further understanding of several fundamental issues related to transformation. For example, on the issue of Party leadership, most people further realized the truth that "of all the thousands of things, the Party's leadership is the first"; recognizing that the unprecedented improvement in the international status of the motherland, the brilliant achievements of domestic construction, and the fact that industrial and commercial figures can make some progress in socialist transformation and make some contributions to socialist construction, are all due to the correct leadership of the Party. The Party's leadership is the fundamental of fundamentals, the core of cores. Therefore, many people feel that only by loyally accepting the Party's leadership can there be a direction in the future, only by accepting the Party's leadership can there be a future, and only by accepting the Party's leadership can there be strength. Therefore, they expressed their firm determination to follow the Party's instructions, take care of one end, lean to one side, and wholeheartedly lean towards the Party. On the issue of accepting transformation, many people further realized the long-term, complex, and repeated nature of transformation, and felt that mountains are changing, waters are changing, everything is changing, and if they don't change themselves, they will fall behind, and it is not possible not to transform the bourgeois world outlook, so subjective efforts are needed. Large, medium, and small households all worship the same God of Wealth and engage in capitalism. After the small households heard this analysis, they felt that it solved the most problems. Therefore, some people said, "Although I was a small household in the past, I always 'learned from and caught up with' the big capitalists and desperately climbed upwards." As a result, there has been a considerable reversal in the emotions of small households who felt that transformation was unjust. Industrial and commercial youths also realized that "regardless of youth or old age, whoever does not transform will fall behind," and "even if it is a 'Liberation brand' capitalist, it won't work if the bourgeois things in his mind are not transformed!" Many family members of industrial and commercial figures, through recollection and comparison, realized that in the future they must step out of the family and actively participate in social services in order to be thoroughly transformed and thoroughly liberated. On the issue of the relationship between service and transformation, many people reviewed the specific practices of the past two years and the realistic education of the two evaluation campaigns, and further strengthened their confidence and determination to actively serve and strengthen transformation. For example, some people said: "The Party has given a very high evaluation to the small achievements we have made in taking this road, pointing out that our path is correct, and in the future, we must forge ahead in this direction." In this transmission, what the industrial and commercial circles felt the deepest and promoted the most was the Party's clearly proposed policy of "taking care of one end." Many people shed tears of gratitude during the discussion, feeling that "the Party is closer than parents, parents cannot take care of us for a lifetime, but the Party takes care of us and our descendants." Many people also connected it to the past, believing that "they always used the heart of capitalism to measure the belly of socialism," "Now that the Party has taken care of our work and life, what else is there to say, just do a good job!" Due to the Party's great call, most industrial and commercial figures have a feeling of "gratitude and repayment" to the Party. After studying the instructions of "taking care of one end and leaning to one side," they expressed that "we must turn our gratitude into strength," "we must do a good job of transforming and serving well to repay the Party's care." Even those who were not very active in the past have changed their attitudes and become active. Because this transmission and implementation touched a wide range of people, the promotion was deep and the effect was great. Most people became active to varying degrees and made achievements, mobilizing positive factors for socialist construction.

Look at others, compare yourself, and guarantee to learn from activists

After most people improved their understanding, enlightened themselves, and clarified their direction, we took advantage of the heat and invited responsible comrades from the city, districts, bureaus, and various specialized companies to put forward the current central tasks, organized the exchange of experiences between activists in industrial and commercial circles in serving and transforming, so that most people could find specific directions for current efforts and role models to learn from, and could naturally be guided to carry out the socialist competition of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping, thus setting off a vigorous and solid new upsurge of service.

We focused on organizing various types and different content of small and medium-sized meetings for experience exchange, so as to achieve the purpose of rapid action, wide coverage, many people, combination of reality and emptiness, and in-depth effect. Among the 116 large, medium, and small meetings, 110 small and medium-sized meetings were held in just two days. This created momentum, mobilized the masses, prompted everyone to use their brains, and the backbone was also trained and improved. These meetings were organized not only according to industry and trade, but also organized experience exchange meetings for technicians, industrial and commercial youths, family members of industrial and commercial figures, private sector working groups, and various counties, live meetings for technical performances and technical teaching, on-the-spot martial arts competitions, and exhibitions of service and transformation experiences of private sector personnel in district industries. A total of 256 activists were organized to speak at various meetings. Because the content of the meetings was rich and colorful, with service achievements, ideological changes, and all aimed at the common problems existing in the industrial and commercial circles and closely combined with the central tasks of the enterprises, with a clear reality and ideological nature, it was full of infection and persuasiveness, so that the people participating in the meeting were greatly promoted and received profound realistic education, making it easy for everyone to "match the number" and "take what they need." Therefore, many moving events occurred during the meeting.

For example, some people were very moved after listening to the personal accounts of typical experiences of activists. Some people said: "The ideological situation of the activists is similar to my own in many ways. They can transform and progress because they are willing to expose themselves to the Party and get the Party's help. I have problems and I am unwilling to talk about them, so how can I progress? I must learn from them in the future." Some people also said, "I have listened to the speeches of many activists and found that they have a common point, that is, they are willing to lean towards the Party, listen to the Party's words, and be able to humbly learn from the working class and make achievements in service. In the past, I could not understand these things, and I could not improve my understanding. This time, looking at others and comparing myself, I am convinced, and I guarantee that I will definitely learn from them and strive to become an activist in 1960." Some activists also thought that they were almost there before participating in the meeting, but after listening to other people's speeches, they felt that "even if I compare myself in the industrial and commercial circles, I am still far behind. There are really talented people behind talented people. I have to study hard and catch up hard when I go back."

Learn the style of the working class, participate in technical innovation and technical revolution

Through practice, carrying out the competition of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping, industrial and commercial figures can gradually cultivate feelings for socialism, so that the ideology of "large," "public," and "commune" gradually increases, and the ideology of "small," "private," and "capitalist" gradually breaks down, which is conducive to industrial and commercial figures breaking capitalism and establishing communes and strengthening transformation. For example, after the transmission and implementation meeting, according to preliminary statistics, there were 15,994 pairs of counterpart competitions carried out between districts, counties, companies, industries, factories, shops, and groups, as well as between people; not only were short-distance competition agreements and contracts signed, but also specific measures for inspection and supervision of implementation were set, which made it easy to implement the agreement conditions. Among the "foreign" technicians, the promotion received this time was also deeper. Through experience exchange, they gradually realized from some new things they heard or saw that among the private sector technicians, whether "local," "semi-local and semi-foreign," "foreign," or even those who originally had no technology, as long as they can closely rely on the leadership of the Party, rely on the help of the workers and masses, and can break superstitions and conservatism, use their brains, think of ways, and learn the communist style of the working class daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, they will make achievements in technical innovation and technical revolution. For example, at the live meeting on mechanization and automatic lines for foundry workers, private sector personnel from 14 foundry factories said on the spot: "In the past, I always thought that other industries could engage in mechanization, and I never dared to think that foundry workers could automate. Now that I have seen it with my own eyes, there is nothing mysterious. As long as everyone uses their brains, they can think of ways, and we will do it immediately when we go back." A private sector person from a vehicle factory originally planned to build two automatic lines to pay tribute to "May Day." This time, they were promoted and, with the help of the workers, fought for two days and nights to achieve it more than a month in advance; Before the transmission and implementation conference, the private sector personnel in the industrial field had already taken active action and realized 298 new products including high-precision and cutting-edge products, 189 stand-alone automation machines, and 32 automatic lines. After the meeting, there was new development. For example, an unmanned workshop for the automation of the production of thumbtacks has appeared in a stationery factory. In the commercial field, more than 200 private sector master chefs from the catering company have also gone down to the streets to help improve the street canteens. At the technical performance meeting, the spirit of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping was even more prominent. Some people used to take eight minutes to install a bicycle, and they felt it was very fast. At the performance meeting, they saw that someone installed it in only five minutes, so they immediately expressed their willingness to work hard to learn, and the two signed a competition agreement on the spot, teaching and learning from each other and improving together. There was also a private sector person who had high-speed technology for removing sheep bones, and could remove five to six sheep per hour. This technology is being promoted throughout the industry. Promoted by the experience exchange, a private sector person successfully trial-produced a rapid bone-separating machine, turning thousands of years of manual operation into mechanization, and could remove 50 sheep per hour.

In this competition between people, there are also 1,141 pairs of husband and wife competitions, as well as many new forms of father and son competitions, brother competitions, sisters-in-law competitions, sister competitions, and whole family competitions. Although this type of competition does not involve a large number of people, this competition can not only increase the socialist component in the family, but also help to transform the bourgeois family and change the relationship between people in the family.

For family members of industrial and commercial figures, it is also necessary to carry out meticulous ideological mobilization work

There are a total of 30,400 family members of industrial and commercial figures in Tianjin City and districts. Under the leadership and education of the Party after liberation, more than 12,000 people have stepped out of the family and participated in various social labors. According to the survey, there are still 12,000 to 13,000 people who have the conditions to step out of the family. After this transmission of the instructions of the Party Central Committee leaders, many family members of industrial and commercial figures have made varying degrees of improvement in their understanding, but in the future, a lot of meticulous and in-depth ideological mobilization work and organizational work are still needed to enable the family members of industrial and commercial figures to be better transformed.

In general, through this period of work, we have further realized that in promoting the work of actively serving and strengthening transformation in the industrial and commercial circles, closely relying on the leadership of the Party, adhering to the mass line, using the method of evaluation and the socialist competition method of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping, can make the work more, faster, better, and more economical, and can conform to the spirit of the general line. In the future, we must also implement the Party's policy of continuous revolution and lead this competition movement to in-depth development.

At present, through this education and promotion, most people in the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles have improved their ideological understanding and enthusiasm for service to varying degrees under the great call of the Party, but it is also necessary to see that the Party's policies and policies need to be further deeply understood. For example, some people have not deeply understood the spirit of "taking care of one end and leaning to one side"; some people still feel nervous about the sustained great leap forward; some people still hold a hesitant wait-and-see attitude towards vigorously engaging in the four modernizations of industry; and they still cannot break the superstitious and conservative ideology; although the urban people's commune movement has been less shocking this time, many people still do not hold a positive welcoming attitude, and some people even have resistant and dissatisfied emotions. Therefore, it is still necessary to study hard, improve understanding, actively serve, and strengthen transformation to adapt to the requirements of the current situation.

Under the leadership and education of the Party, the industrial and commercial figures of Hebei Province have made a lot of progress in recent years, which just shows the unparalleled brilliance and correctness of the Party's policy of peaceful transformation, which is also the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. We must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works and set off a high tide of learning. We must take care of one end, lean to one side, wholeheartedly listen to Chairman Mao's words, wholeheartedly follow the Communist Party, wholeheartedly accept transformation, wholeheartedly serve socialism, and work with the people of the whole country to complete and overfulfill China's 1960 national economic plan.

    兴“大”“公”“社”  破“小”“私”“资”
    王光英、朱继圣、朱梦苏、吴韫山、周叔弢代表谈河北工商界的自我改造各位代表：
    我们完全同意和拥护李富春、李先念和谭震林三位副总理的报告，并在工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    三位副总理的报告，总结了1959年的巨大成就，展示了1960年国民经济继续全面跃进和整个六十年代持续跃进的宏伟壮丽的前景。这个伟大的、振奋人心的新形势，给我们工商界进一步接受社会主义改造，带来了极为有利的条件，同时也对我们提出了更好地服务、更好地改造的要求。
    河北省民建、工商联两会各级组织，由于贯彻执行了党的以政治思想为统帅、以劳动实践为基础，以企业或工作岗位为基地，并把三者结合起来的改造的方针，运用群众性自我教育的评比方法，推动全省工商业者结合个人改造规划，按期总结服务与改造的实践情况，以比改造、比贡献、比劳动、比学习为内容，展开评比，评选接受社会主义改造、为社会主义服务的积极分子，树立先进旗帜，影响和带动一般；并在这个基础上，掀起学、比、赶、帮的社会主义竞赛。这一工作，自1958年起，已经进行了两年，并取得显著的成效。以天津市的情况为例，1959年评选出的积极分子，就占全市工商界总人数的14％强，比1958年的9.3％增加了50％多，积极分子服务与改造典型事迹的内容质量，也比1958年有了很大的提高。
    不久以前，民建、工商联两会召开了全国代表大会。党中央领导人指出工商界一年多来是大有进步，但没有前进到多数人解决了或者基本上解决了政治立场的地步，因此还要继续进行改造。同时也明确指出了今后努力方向；谆谆教导我们要“顾一头”，顾国家利益、人民利益的一头，“一边倒”，倒向社会主义这一边。教导我们要坚持不懈地从生产实践和社会实践中，努力加强自我改造；并在实践的同时，认真学习毛主席著作，改造政治立场和世界观。因此下决心，立志气，顾一头、一边倒，一心一意听毛主席的话，一心一意跟着共产党走，一心一意接受改造，一心一意为社会主义服务，为国家利益、人民利益作出更多的贡献，就是我们工商业者改造的最关键、最根本的问题。天津市民建、工商联两会组织为了积极推动全市工商业者坚决遵循党的教导，认真传达贯彻了民建、工商联两会全国代表大会精神决议，进一步掀起本市工商业者为社会主义服务的新高潮。我们采取了边传达、边贯彻、边交流经验，边学习，边行动的灵活多样的方法，贯彻和风细雨，群众性自我教育的方针开展了工作。由于我们坚决依靠了党的领导，贯彻了群众路线进行了广泛的发动和充分的准备工作，因此在七天的时间内，交叉进行了一百一十六个大中小型会议，组织了一万三千多人（共五万人次）参加了会议，由于会内会外一齐动，使全市90％以上的工商业者普遍受到了启发和教育。
    山在变，水在变，一切都在变，自己不变就要掉队
    党中央各位领导的教导和指示经过传达讨论，使与会同志对有关改造的几个根本性的问题有了进一步的认识。如对党的领导问题，大多数人都进一步认识到“千条万条，党的领导是第一条”的真理；认识到祖国国际地位的空前提高，国内建设的辉煌成就，以及工商业者能在社会主义改造中取得一些进步，为社会主义建设作出点滴贡献，无一不是由于党的正确领导。党的领导是根本的根本，核心的核心。所以有很多人感到今后只有忠诚接受党的领导才有方向，只有接受党的领导才有前途，只有接受党的领导才有力量。因此纷纷表示坚决遵循党的指示，顾一头、一边倒，一心一意向党靠拢。在对接受改造的问题上，有不少人进一步认识到改造的长期性、复杂性和反复性，感到山在变、水在变，一切都在变，自己不变就要掉队，资产阶级世界观不改造不行，因此需要主观努力。对大中小户供的是一个财神爷，都是搞资本主义那一套，小户听了这个分析，认为最解决问题。因此，有人说“过去我虽然是小户，可老是向大资本家‘学赶超’，死命的往上爬”，因而在小户觉得改造冤的情绪上有了不少的扭转。工商青年也认识到“不管青年  老年，谁不改造谁也要掉队”，“尽管是‘解放牌’的资本家，脑子里的资产阶级东西不改造那成！”工商业者家属不少人通过回忆对比，认识到今后必须走出家庭，积极参加社会服务，才能得到彻底改造、彻底解放。在对服务与改造的关系问题上，不少人回顾了二年来的具体实践和两次评比运动的现实教育，进一步坚定了积极服务加强改造的信心和决心。如有的人说：“党对我们走这条路取得的点滴成绩，都给了很高的评价，指出我们的道走对了，今后我们一定要朝着这个方向奋勇前进。”在这次传达中，使工商界感受最深，促动最大的是党明确提出的“包一头”的政策，有很多人在讨论时流出了感激的热泪，感到“党比父母还亲，父母都不能包一辈子，而党把我们本身和我们的子子孙孙都包下来了。”很多人还联系到过去，认为“自己过去总是拿资本主义之心，度社会主义之腹，”“现在党把我们的工作生活都包下来了，还有什么说的，就是好好干吧！”由于党的伟大感召，大多数工商业者都有了对党“感恩图报”的心情，再学习了“顾一头、一边倒”的指示后，纷纷表示“我们一定把感激的心情化为力量，”“一定干个样儿，好好地改造，好好地服务，来报答党的关怀。”就是过去一向不大动的，也有好多人改变了态度，积极起来。由于这次传达贯彻触及的面广人多，所以促动深、效果大，大多数人都不同程度地积极起来，并作出了成绩，为社会主义建设调动了积极因素。
      看看人家，比比自己，保证向积极分子学习
    在多数人提高认识、启发自觉、明确方向之后，我们就乘热打铁，请市，区，局，各专业公司的负责同志提出当前中心任务，组织工商界积极分子服务与改造的经验交流，使多数人都能找到当前的具体努力方向和学习榜样，也就能很自然地引导着开展学比赶帮的社会主义竞赛，从而掀起一个轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实的服务新高潮。
    我们组织经验交流的重点，放在组织各种类型和不同内容的中小型会议上，这样才能达到行动迅速、面广人多、虚实结合，效果深入的目的。在一百一十六次大中小型会议中，仅在两天的时间内就开了中小型的会一百一十个。这样就造成了声势，发动了群众，促使人人开动脑筋，骨干也得到锻炼提高。这些会议是除了按行按业组织进行外，同时还组织了技术人员、工商青年、工商业者家属、私方工作组和各县的经验交流会，技术表演和技术传授的献宝取经现场会，对口比武竞赛会，以及区行业的私方人员服务与改造经验的展览会。在各种会议上共组织了二百五十六个积极分子作了发言。由于会议内容丰富多彩，有服务成绩，有思想变化，又都是针对工商界普遍存在的问题并密切结合了企业的中心任务，具有鲜明的现实性和思想性，所以富有感染力和说服力，使参加会议的人受到很大的促动，得到深刻的现实教育，使大家容易“对号”，“各取所需”，因而在会议进行期间，出现了很多的动人事例。
    如有些人在听过积极分子典型经验的现身说法后，很受感动，有的人说：“积极分子的思想情况有好多和自己一样，人家可以能够转变进步，是肯于向党暴露，得到党的帮助，我有问题不肯讲，那怎么能进步呢？今后我得好好向他们学习。”也有人说“我听了很多积极分子的发言，发现他们有个共同点，就是肯于向党靠拢，听党的话，能够虚心向工人阶级学习，在服务中作出成绩，过去对这些总是搞不通，认识不上去，这回看看人家，比比自己，我可服了，保证一定向他们学习，争取在1960年当上积极分子。”还有的积极分子在参加会议前认为自己差不多了，在听了别人的发言后，才感到“自己就是在工商界比一比，也还差的多，真是能人背后有能人，回去还要好好学习，好好赶”。
    学习工人阶级的风格，参加技术革新和技术革命
    通过实践，开展学比赶帮的竞赛，工商业者就可以逐步培养对社会主义的感情，使“大”，“公”、“社”的思想逐步增长，“小”、“私”、“资”的思想逐步破掉，这就有利于工商业者破资立社，加强改造。如在传达贯彻会后，初步统计，区、县、公司、行业、厂、店、小组之间以及人与人之间开展的对口竞赛就有一万五千九百九十四件；不仅签订了短距离的竞赛协议、合同，同时也定出检查督促实现的具体措施，这就便于使协议条件落实。在“洋”技术人员中，这次受到的促动也较深，通过经验交流后，他们从听到的或看到的一些新鲜事物中，逐步认识到在私方技术人员中，不管是“土”的，“半土半洋的”，“洋”的，以至原来没有什么技术的人，只要能够紧密依靠党的领导、依靠职工群众的帮助，并且能够破除迷信和保守，动脑筋、想办法，学习工人阶级敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，就会在技术革新和技术革命中作出成绩来。如在铸工机械化和自动线的现场会议上，当场就有十四个铸工厂的私方人员说：“过去总认为别的行业能搞机械化，铸工能自动化那就根本不敢想，现在亲眼看到了，并没有什么神秘，只要大家动脑筋，就能想出办法，我们回去要立刻就搞”，有一个车具厂的私方人员原来计划搞两条自动线向“五一”献礼，这次受到了促动，在职工帮助下奋战两昼夜就提前一个多月实现了；传达贯彻大会以前，在工业方面的私方人员就已积极行动，实现了包括高精尖的新产品二百九十八种，单机自动化一百八十九台，自动线三十二条，会后更有了新的发展，如在一个文具工厂内已出现了一个生产大头针自动化的无人车间。在商业方面，饮食公司的私方老师傅，也有二百多人分别下到街道，帮助搞好街道食堂。在技术表演会上，学比赶帮的精神表现得更较突出，有的人过去用八分钟安装一辆自行车，自己觉得很快了，在表演会上看到有人只用五分钟就安装好了，他就立即表示要努力学习，两个人当场签订了竞赛协议，互教互学，共同提高。还有个私方人员对剔羊骨有高速技术，每小时可剔五至六只羊，这个技术正在全业推广，通过经验交流的促动就有个私方人员试制成功了快速分骨机，把几千年的手工操作也变成机械化，每小时可剔羊五十只。
    这次在人与人的竞赛当中，还出现了一千一百四十一对夫妻赛，还有许多对父子赛，兄弟赛，妯娌赛，姊妹赛，全家赛的新形式，虽然这种竞赛人数还不多，但这种竞赛不仅在家庭中可以增加社会主义成分，而且还有利于改造资产阶级式的家庭，改变家庭中人与人的关系。
    对工商业者的家属，还要进行细致的思想发动工作
    工商业者家属，在天津市、区共有三万零四百多人，解放后在党的领导教育下，已经有一万二千多人走出了家庭，参加了各项社会劳动，据调查还有一万二千至一万三千人有条件走出家庭，通过这次传达党中央领导同志的指示后，有不少工商业者家属在认识上已有了不同程度的提高，但今后还需要做很多细致深入的思想发动工作和组织工作，才能使工商业者家属更好得到改造。
    总起来说，通过这段工作，使我们进一步体会到，在推动工商界积极服务加强改造的工作中，紧密依靠党的领导，坚持群众路线，运用评比的方式和学比赶帮的社会主义竞赛方法，就能使工作做到多、快、好、省，就能符合总路线的精神。今后还要贯彻党的不断革命的方针，把这一竞赛运动引向纵深发展。
    目前，天津市工商界，通过这次教育和推动，大多数人在党的伟大感召下，思想认识和服务积极性都有了不同程度的提高，但是还要看到对党的方针政策还需要进一步深入的领会。如有些人对“顾一头，一边倒”的精神，还没有深刻认识；有些人对持续大跃进还感到紧张；有的人对大搞工业四化仍抱着迟疑观望态度；还打不破迷信保守思想；对城市人民公社化运动，虽然这次震动比较小些，但不少人还不是抱着积极欢迎的态度，有的人甚至还存在抵触不满情绪。因此，还需要努力学习，提高认识，积极服务，加强改造，以适应当前形势的要求。
    我们河北省工商业者几年来在党的领导和教育下，得到了不少进步，正说明党的和平改造政策的无比英明正确，也就是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我们必须认真学习毛主席的著作，掀起一个学习高潮。我们一定要顾一头，一边倒，一心一意听毛主席的话，一心一意跟共产党走，一心一意接受改造，一心一意为社会主义服务，和全国人民一道为完成和超额完成我国1960年的国民经济计划而奋斗。
