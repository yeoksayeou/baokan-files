Miscellaneous Notes on the "Thirty" Movement, by Xiong Shanglian, Deputy Secretary of the Shanggao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangxi

Today, the county committee held a meeting to study the development of diversified economy and vigorously develop commodity production throughout the county. Xin Feng, the first secretary of the county committee, explained in detail the significance of developing diversified economy on the premise of ensuring the development of grain, cotton, and oil production, and put forward specific opinions on carrying out the "Thirty" Movement. The "Thirty" is: "Ten Breedings" with pig raising as the key, raising pigs, cattle, fish, chickens, ducks, geese, silkworms, sheep, bees, and rabbits; "Ten Plantings" with vegetables as the center, planting vegetables, sugar cane, feed, garlic, flue-cured tobacco, medicinal materials, melons, ginger, ramie, and lotus roots; "Ten Cultivations" mainly of timber forests, cultivating fruit trees, oil-tea trees, tea trees, bamboo, Chinese fir, palm trees, Chinese tallow trees, pine trees, paulownia trees, and mulberry trees, so that Shanggao will not only greatly develop agricultural production, but also achieve all-round development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, becoming a land of fish and rice.

In Shanggao, such a good place with undulating hills and fertile land, what production cannot be developed! Now the central government's instructions are like bright lights illuminating the way forward, and we are heading in this direction.
              ＊＊
The county committee has held meetings for several days in a row. My heart has not been calm. According to the diversified economy office, the "Thirty" Movement has developed quite rapidly during this period. In less than one hundred days, the number of live pigs increased by 56%, and the number of sows increased three and a half times. Another new feature of pig raising is that more than 750 pig farms have been established from the county to the production team in distant fields and hills, which are both animal husbandry bases and fertilizer bases. The masses are overjoyed and say: "In the past, wild animals howled in remote and barren fields, but now you can see fertilizer and hear the sound of pigs everywhere." This method can not only develop animal husbandry production at high speed, but also accelerate the transformation of low-yielding fields. The production of other livestock and poultry has also increased several times or even dozens of times, and poultry production has become a red flag in the entire district. In vegetable production, more than 230 commodity bases have been established, and scattered land is also fully utilized.

As soon as the county committee meeting ended, I went to the countryside. I remember taking a car back to the county before the new year, and I took the same road. At that time, the mountains on both sides of the road were still covered in thick snow, and it was all white, and nothing could be distinguished. Now the snow has melted, and everything is very different from before. The wasteland and barren land from the county seat to the commune for more than forty miles have all changed. Taller mountains are planted with pine trees, fir trees, and bamboo, while low-lying and flat land has been plowed by tractors, holes have been dug, and the edges of the holes are piled with turf and manure, ready to plant various fruit trees. This area will become a base for the cultivation farm and the horticultural farm. The whole farm will plant citrus, pear trees, jujube trees, peach trees, tea trees this year... The total planting area reaches 1,500 mu. Next to the horticultural farm, a 10,000-pig farm is under construction. The production of the horticultural farm and the 10,000-pig farm are closely linked. Pig manure fertilizes fruit trees, and feed is planted under the fruit trees, promoting mutual development of pig raising and horticulture.

We left the horticultural farm and walked westward. Every short distance there was a collective pig farm. It is really not easy to build pig farms in such wilderness. The pigpens are made of dismantled broken houses and chopped miscellaneous firewood, and some are earthen caves; the pig breeds are solved by self-breeding and mutual adjustment; wild green fodder is the main source, and measures such as planting, digging, collecting, processing and storage are taken to solve the shortage of feed. In short, everything is self-reliant.
            ＊＊
This trip to the countryside has further shown me from practice the necessity and possibility of developing production in an all-round way. What materials, manpower... can all be arranged in a unified manner. Last year, as a result of the all-round development of production, the income of the commune members increased greatly. Most of the 70 poorer production teams in the county have approached or caught up with the level of the wealthy teams. For example, the net income of the commune members of the Huangshan Brigade increased from an average of 48 yuan per person in 1958 to 107 yuan, of which sideline income increased tenfold, catching up with the level of the wealthy teams.

Of course, the significance of developing production in an all-round way is not limited to the increase in the income of the commune members, but more importantly, it has created a large amount of material wealth for the society and supported the needs of urban and industrial construction. Last year, the total amount of procurement of agricultural and sideline products in the county increased by 40% compared with 1958, completing the task twenty days ahead of schedule; this year, in January and February, it overfulfilled the procurement task within the planned period.

    “三十”运动杂记	中共江西上高县委副书记　熊尚连
    今天县委举行会议，研究在全县范围内开展多种经营，大力发展商品生产。县委第一书记辛枫同志详细地说明了在保证粮、棉、油生产发展的前提下，开展多种经营的意义，提出了开展“三十”运动的具体意见。“三十”就是：以养猪为纲的“十养”，养猪、牛、鱼、鸡、鸭、鹅、蚕、羊、蜂、兔；以蔬菜为中心的“十种”，种蔬菜、甘蔗、饲料、大蒜、烤烟、药材、瓜类、生姜、苎麻、莲藕；以用材林为主的“十栽”，栽果树、油茶、茶叶、毛竹、杉树、棕树、木子树（乌桕）、松树、桐树、桑树，使上高不仅农业生产大发展，而且要林、牧、副、渔全面大发展，成为鱼米之乡。
    在我们上高这样一个丘陵起伏、土地肥沃的好地方，有什么生产不可以发展呢！现在中央的指示像明灯一样照明了前进的方向，我们正朝着这个方向奔去。
              ＊＊
    县委接连开了几天会。我的心一直没有平静下来。听多种经营办公室说，这一个时期，“三十”运动发展得挺快。不到一百天的时间生猪增加了56％，母猪翻了三点五番。养猪的另一个新貌是，从县到生产队在远田山岗建立了七百五十多个养猪场，既是畜牧基地又是肥料基地，群众万分喜悦地说：“过去远田瘦地野兽叫，现在处处见肥闻猪声。”这种办法既可以高速度发展畜牧业生产，又能加速改造低产田。其它畜禽生产，也有了几倍以至十几倍的增长，家禽生产成为全专区的一面红旗。蔬菜生产，建立了商品基地二百三十多个，同时充分利用零星土地。
    县委会议一结束，我就下乡去了。记得年前乘汽车回县的时候，也是走的这条公路，那时公路两旁的山岭还穿着厚厚的雪衣，到处是白茫茫的，什么也辨别不清楚。现在雪化了，一切与从前大不相同。从县城到公社四十余里没有开垦的荒山荒地，现在全变样了。高一些的山栽上了松树、杉树、毛竹，矮山平地都被拖拉机耕翻了，打好了穴，穴边堆满了草皮、粪肥，准备栽各种果树。这一带将成为垦殖场和园艺场经营的基地。全场今年要栽柑桔、梨树、红枣树、桃树、茶叶……总栽种面积达一千五百亩。园艺场的旁边，正在建设万猪场。园艺场和万猪场的生产是紧密联系着的，猪粪肥果树，果树下面种饲料，养猪园艺互相促进。
    我们离开园艺场向西边走去，每走不远就有一个集体养猪场。在这样的旷野之地建起猪场，真是不简单，猪栏是拆破屋、砍杂柴做的，有的是挖土洞栏；猪种是自繁自养和互相调剂解决的；以野生青饲料为主，采取种、挖、采、加工贮藏等办法解决了饲料不足的困难。总之，一切都是自力更生。
            ＊＊
    这次下乡使我从实际中进一步看到了全面发展生产的必要性和可能性。什么物资呀，人力呀……都是可以统筹安排的。去年由于全面发展生产的结果，社员的收入大大增加，全县七十个较穷的生产队，大部分已经接近或赶上了富裕队的水平。像黄山大队社员的纯收入由1958年每人平均四十八元提高到一百零七元，其中副业收入猛增十倍，赶上了富裕队的水平。
    当然，全面发展生产的意义不限于社员收入的增加，更重要的一方面是为社会创造了大批的物质财富，支援了城市和工业建设的需要。全县去年农副产品收购总金额比1958年增加40％，提前二十天完成任务；今年1、2月又超额完成了计划期内的收购任务。
