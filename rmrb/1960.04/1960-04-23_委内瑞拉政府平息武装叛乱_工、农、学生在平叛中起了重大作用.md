Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, April 21st: The military rebellion that occurred in Venezuela on the morning of the 20th, supported by the Dominican dictatorship and U.S. imperialism, has been quelled by the joint action of Venezuelan patriotic forces and government troops by the 21st. The rebel stronghold, the city of San Cristobal, capital of Tachira State, was recaptured by government forces on the morning of the 21st.

According to reports, government troops, after receiving orders to attack the rebels, occupied all the strongholds in Tachira State, which had been controlled by the rebels for 24 hours, within a few hours, and surrounded the city of San Cristobal, where the rebels were concentrated. Most of the rebels surrendered after clashing with the Venezuelan regular army, and a small number of rebels fled towards the Colombian border.

Local residents of San Cristobal raised the Venezuelan flag and marched in the streets, celebrating the victory over the rebels. Radio stations such as "Voice of Tachira" and municipal organs have returned to normal.

According to a radio station in Zulia State, forces loyal to the government arrested Moncada Vidal, a senior leader of the rebels. Rebel leader Castro León has fled to the border area bordering Colombia. The Venezuelan government has requested the Colombian government to arrest the criminals who participated in this rebellion.

Andrés Pérez, secretary of the Acción Democrática (Democratic Action) district organization in the rebellion area, said through the San Cristobal radio station that there were still rebels in the suburbs, and the local garrison, with the help of militia battalions, was sweeping up the remaining rebels.

According to newspaper reports, the Venezuelan working class, peasants, professionals, and students played an important role in defeating this anti-democratic rebellion. Leaders and members of the Communist Party and Acción Democrática have been united and taking joint action. A large number of peasants took up sticks, stones, machetes, shotguns, etc., and came from the mountains and neighboring rural areas to San Cristobal to directly participate in the struggle to suppress the rebellion.

Communist Party leader Silvio Ramírez gave a speech, emphasizing the role played by the working class, peasants, and revolutionary students in defeating Castro León's criminal group, their unity in defensive and offensive actions, and the prominent role played by the Communist Party in these actions.

He said that the people are now mobilizing to demand that the government take strong measures against the military and non-military rebellion conspirators of the big bourgeoisie who collude with imperialism.

    委内瑞拉政府平息武装叛乱
    工、农、学生在平叛中起了重大作用
    新华社加拉加斯21日电　20日清晨在委内瑞拉发生的、得到多米尼加独裁政权和美帝国主义支持的军事叛乱，在委内瑞拉爱国力量和政府军队的联合行动下，已经在21日被平息。叛乱者的堡垒——塔奇拉州首府圣克里斯托巴尔市已经在21日早晨为政府军收复。
    据报道，政府军在接到出击叛乱者的命令之后几个小时就占领了被叛乱分子控制了二十四小时的塔奇拉州的各个据点，并包围了叛乱者集中的圣克里斯托巴尔市。大部分叛乱者在同委内瑞拉正规军交锋之后都已缴械投降，少部分叛乱分子向哥伦比亚国境逃窜。
    圣克里斯托巴尔当地居民升起了委内瑞拉国旗，并且在大街上游行，庆祝对叛乱者斗争的胜利。塔奇拉之声等广播电台和市政机关已经恢复正常。
    据苏利亚州的一家无线电广播电台报道，忠于政府的力量逮捕了叛乱者的一高级头目蒙卡达·比塔耳。叛乱首领卡斯特罗·莱昂已经逃到同哥伦比亚交界的边境地区。委内瑞拉政府已经要求哥伦比亚政府逮捕参加这次叛乱的罪犯。
    叛乱发生地区的民主行动党区组织的书记安德烈斯·佩雷兹通过圣克里斯托巴尔电台发表谈话说，郊区还有叛乱分子，目前驻扎当地的警卫部队在民兵大队的帮助下正在对残余叛乱分子进行扫荡。
    据报纸报道，委内瑞拉工人阶级、农民、自由职业者和学生在击溃这次反民主叛乱的斗争中起了重要的作用。共产党和民主行动党等的领导人和党员一直团结在一起，采取共同行动。大批农民拿起了木棍、石头、砍刀、猎枪等从山上和邻近的农村来到圣克里斯托巴尔直接参加了镇压叛乱的斗争。
    共产党领导人西耳维奥·拉米雷斯发表谈话，强调指出了工人阶级、农民和革命学生在击溃卡斯特罗·莱昂罪恶集团中所起的作用、他们在防守和进攻行动中的团结一致以及共产党在这些行动所起的突出作用。
    他说，人民现在正动员起来，以便要求政府采取有力的措施来反对勾结帝国主义的大资产阶级的军事的和非军事的叛乱阴谋分子。
