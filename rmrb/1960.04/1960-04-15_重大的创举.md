    A Significant Innovation

      The Fuzhou Tea Factory, using indigenous methods, has produced modern and advanced equipment, creating an automated production line. This will have a significant impact on the great leap forward in tea production in Fujian Province. The more profound significance of the Fuzhou Tea Factory's achievement lies in its complete dismantling of the superstition that "indigenous methods are definitely inferior to foreign methods," thereby further liberating people's minds and encouraging them to boldly scale the heights of the technological revolution. Some people never believe in the power of indigenous methods or the brilliance of the principle of simultaneously employing indigenous and foreign methods. Our struggle against this kind of thinking is essentially a struggle over whether or not the technological innovation and technological revolution should implement the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Experience tells us that without small-scale indigenous groups, without the simultaneous use of indigenous and foreign methods, it would have been impossible to rapidly establish Fujian Province's powerful steel industry from a foundation of virtually nothing. Similarly, without the principle and path of simultaneously employing indigenous and foreign methods, there would be no victory in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement.
    There are also some people who, while verbally acknowledging the benefits of indigenous methods, only regard them as an expedient measure. Even though we have already progressed from indigenous to foreign, using indigenous methods to create advanced equipment, they still insist on labeling you as "indigenous." Look at the Fuzhou Tea Factory: the rapidly and automatically operating entire process of embryo-scented flowers, baking and other automatic production lines, the advanced electrostatic stem-absorbing machine, and the ingenious pomelo flower separation machine, which is one hundred and twenty times more efficient than manual production... All of these machines, apart from the fact that they use wood, which is cheaper and more labor-saving than steel, are in no way inferior to foreign machines in terms of production efficiency. People should be inspired, encouraged, and educated by this great fact.
    For thousands of years, the working masses, who have suffered from manual operation and heavy physical labor, have a strong desire and demand to transform manual operation into mechanized and semi-mechanized production. They are doing everything possible to quickly break away from manual operation and heavy physical labor, and to quickly change our country's "poor and blank" state. Therefore, they are the vanguards in the technological revolution and our most important force to rely on. By closely relying on them and uniting the broad masses of the people (including technical personnel), our technological innovation and technological revolution movement will surely develop vigorously, and more great creations like the Fuzhou Tea Factory will inevitably emerge.

### 重大的创举

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    重大的创举
      福州茶厂用土办法做出了现代化的、先进的设备，搞出了自动生产线。这将对福建省茶叶生产大跃进发生巨大的作用。福州茶厂成就的更深刻的意义还在于，它将彻底打破“土办法一定不如洋办法”这个迷信，从而使人们进一步解放思想，大胆地攀登技术革命的高峰。有些人总是不相信土办法的威力、不相信土洋并举方针的英明。我们和这种思想的斗争，实质上是技术革新和技术革命要不要贯彻多快好省方针的斗争。经验告诉我们：没有小土群，没有土洋并举，就不可能在手无寸铁的基础上迅速建立福建省强大的钢铁工业；同样的，没有土洋并举的方针和道路，也就不会有技术革新和技术革命运动的胜利。
    还有一些人，虽然口头上承认土办法有好处，但他们只是把土办法看做是权宜之计，明明我们已经由土到洋，用土办法创造出了先进的设备，但是，他们却还是要咬定你是“土”的。请看福州茶厂吧：那迅速自动运转着的整胚窨花、烘焙等自动生产线，那高级的静电吸梗机，还有那巧妙的、比手工生产效率高一百二十倍的柚花分瓣机……所有这些机器，除了是使用比钢铁更便宜、更省工的木材这一点与洋的不同之外，在生产效率等方面那一点不如洋的呢？人们都应当在这个伟大事实的面前受到应有的启发、鼓舞和教育。
    千百年来身受手工操作、笨重体力劳动折磨的工人群众，对于变手工操作为机械化半机械化生产，有着强烈的愿望和要求。他们千方百计地力争迅速摆脱手工操作，摆脱笨重的体力劳动，迅速改变我们国家“一穷二白”的面貌。因此，他们是技术革命中的急先锋，是我们最主要的依靠力量。紧紧依靠他们，并且团结广大人民群众（包括技术人员），我们的技术革新和技术革命运动就一定能蓬蓬勃勃地发展下去，就必然会出现更多的像福州茶厂这样的伟大的创造。（摘自福建日报）
