Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th dispatch: The Japanese magazine "Sekai" pointed out in its latest issue that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi participated in the wartime militarists' crime of abducting Chinese laborers to Japan and forcing them into slave labor.

In an article of 40,000 characters, the magazine cited information released by relevant Japanese government authorities, articles published in newspapers and periodicals, and testimonies from relevant individuals, exposing the facts of the wartime Japanese government's abduction and massacre of Chinese laborers.

The article quoted the decision made by the Tojo Cabinet meeting on November 27, 1942, regarding the abduction of Chinese laborers. The article pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi, then serving as Minister of Commerce and Industry, participated in this cabinet meeting decision. Prior to this, when the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry drafted a plan to abduct Chinese laborers in 1940, Nobusuke Kishi served as Vice Minister of Commerce and Industry, and later as Vice Minister of Munitions and Minister of State (in charge of munitions). Nobusuke Kishi was the highest person in charge of directly controlling the places where Chinese laborers were forced to perform hard labor. The article pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi bears significant responsibility in the entire process of this matter, and there is no doubt about it.

The article cited statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, pointing out that from April 1943 to May 1945, 38,935 innocent Chinese residents were abducted to Japan, of whom 6,830 died in Japan due to mistreatment.

Itagaki Osamu, Director of the Asian Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, insisted at a meeting of the Senate Budget Committee in March 1958 that the abducted Chinese laborers were conscripted under employment contracts. The article pointed out that this response shows that the Kishi Nobusuke government has not repented for the crime of abducting and massacring Chinese laborers.

The article pointed out that the reason for revealing the full picture of this matter fourteen years after Japan's surrender is that the Japanese government has not yet atoned for its war responsibility for invading China and causing immeasurable disasters to the Chinese people.

The article emphasized that atonement for this war responsibility is a prerequisite for discussing Japan's relations with China in the future. If this matter is forgotten, it will not be possible to correctly understand China's reaction to the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    日本“世界”杂志揭露
    岸信介满手中国劳工的血
    至今仍不悔过　继续敌视中国
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：“世界”杂志在最新出版的一期中指出，日本首相岸信介参与了战时军国主义者劫运中国劳工到日本强迫从事奴隶劳动的罪行。
    杂志在一篇长达四万字的文章中援引日本政府有关当局发表的资料和新闻、报刊上登载的文章以及有关人士的证词，揭露了战时日本政府劫运和虐杀中国劳工的事实。
    这篇文章转引了东条内阁会议在1942年11月27日所作出的关于劫运中国劳工的决定。文章指出，岸信介当时担任商工大臣，参与了这次内阁会议决定。在这以前，当日本商工省在1940年草拟劫运中国劳工计划的时候，岸信介担任商工省次官，随后历任军需省次官和国务大臣（负责军需）。岸信介是直接控制中国劳工从事苦役的场所的最高负责人。文章指出，在这件事的全部过程中，岸信介负有重大责任，这是毫无疑义的。
    文章援引日本外务省公布的统计数字指出，从1943年4月到1945年5月，有三万八千九百三十五名中国善良居民被劫运到日本，其中六千八百三十人由于受到虐待而死在日本。
    日本外务省亚洲局局长板垣修在1958年3月举行的参议院预算委员会会议上硬说被劫运的中国劳工是根据雇用合同征用的。文章指出，这种答复说明岸信介政府对劫运和虐杀中国劳工的罪行还没有悔过。
    文章指出，在日本投降已经十四年的今天还要把这件事情的全貌加以揭露，是因为日本政府至今还没有对侵略中国和给中国人民造成无可估计的灾害的战争责任赎罪。
    文章强调指出，对这种战争责任的赎罪是今后谈论日本对中国关系的前提条件，如果忘掉了这件事情，就不能正确地理解中国对新日美“安全条约”的反应。
