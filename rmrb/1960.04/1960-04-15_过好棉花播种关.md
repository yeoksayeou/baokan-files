A good cotton sowing job is primarily marked by: ensuring the completion of the planting plan, improving the quality of sowing, and achieving full seedling emergence after one sowing. The former is to achieve more planting and more yield, and the latter is to achieve high yield and more yield. Guaranteeing acreage, guaranteeing yield per unit area, and guaranteeing total yield are three interconnected and inseparable links, among which guaranteeing acreage is the primary link. Only on the basis of guaranteeing cotton planting acreage can we strive to increase the yield per unit area and ensure a greater increase in the total national cotton output.

The conditions for successfully completing this year's cotton sowing are very good. Since last winter, a vigorous movement to strive for high-yield cotton over large areas this year has been launched across the country, and vigorously developing high-yield cotton demonstration plots is a major feature of this movement. According to incomplete statistics from the agricultural department, the area of cotton high-yield demonstration plots nationwide has expanded to 43% of the total cotton field area. The preparatory work for cotton fields, centered on soil, fertilizer, and water, has been done better than in previous years around these demonstration plots. Basically, all single-crop cotton fields have undergone deep plowing in winter, and more than 50% of double-crop cotton fields have undergone deep digging of the winter ice in the wheat rows. Nearly 90% of cotton fields nationwide have had base fertilizer applied in conjunction with deep plowing, and the amount of fertilizer applied is generally increased by 1,000 to 2,000 jin compared to last year. The irrigated area of cotton fields has also expanded by 26% compared to the same period last year. In the five provinces of North China, irrigated cotton fields have reached more than 70% of the total area, of which 60% have undergone winter irrigation and early spring irrigation. Various localities have also greatly increased and modified animal-powered seeders and sowing drills, and the area of mechanized sowing will also see great development. All of these have prepared extremely favorable conditions for successfully completing the sowing work.

However, it should also be noted that the arrangement of cotton field sowing areas in individual regions still deviates from the national plan. Although such regions are in the minority, any reduction in cotton planting, even by a fraction of a mu, will affect the improvement of the national total output. To ensure the great leap forward in cotton production, we must first guarantee the planned cotton sowing area. Cotton-producing counties and communes with the conditions should also expand the cotton planting area as much as possible.

Insisting on mass movements of large-scale inspections and comparisons is an important guarantee for successfully completing the cotton sowing task. Xinxiang City in Henan Province organized a 10,000-person sowing inspection and launched a "five checks and five grasps" campaign before sowing: checking soil moisture to grasp drought resistance and moisture preservation, checking tools to grasp inspection, repair, and manufacturing, checking seeds to grasp meticulous processing, checking labor to grasp labor organization, and checking soil temperature to grasp timely sowing; and a "three comparisons" campaign during sowing: comparing sufficient planting, comparing good planting, and comparing timely planting. This method is very good.

To lead cotton production, we must learn to grasp both the current production and the preparatory work for the next stage of production. While inspecting the cotton sowing work, we must also combine it with checking the seedling emergence situation and the preparatory measures for successfully passing the seedling protection stage, so that the high-yield cotton movement can continuously develop and move forward.

### 过好棉花播种关

    过好棉花播种关
    做好棉花播种工作的主要标志是：保证完成种植计划，提高播种质量，做到一次播种一次全苗。前者是为了达到多种多收，后者是为了达到高产多收。保面积、保单产、保总产，这是三位一体不可分割的环节，其中保证面积又是首要环节，只有在保证棉花种植面积的基础上，努力提高单位面积产量，才能确保全国棉花总产量的更大增长。
    过好今年棉花播种关的条件很好。去冬以来，全国已经掀起一个蓬蓬勃勃地争取今年大面积棉花高产运动，大闹棉花丰产方是这个运动的一个主要特点。据农业部门的不完全统计，全国棉花丰产方的面积已扩大到占棉田总面积的43％。围绕丰产方，以土、肥、水为中心的棉田备耕工作，比往年做得更好。一熟棉田基本上全部进行了冬季深耕，两熟棉田有50％以上的面积进行了麦行间深挖冬凌，全国近90％的棉田结合深耕施了基肥，施肥量一般都比去年增加一、两千斤；棉田灌溉面积比去年同期又扩大了26％，华北五省灌溉棉田已达到总面积的70％以上，其中有60％进行了冬灌和早春灌溉；各地还大量增补和改装了畜力播种机和播种耧，机器播种面积也将有很大发展。所有这些，都为胜利做好播种工作准备了极为有利的条件。
    但是也应看到，个别地区对棉田播种面积的安排和国家计划还有距离。这样的地区虽是少数，但是任何一个地方少种一分、一亩棉花，都会给全国总产量的提高带来影响。为了保证棉花生产的大跃进，首先要保证棉田播种面积计划。有条件的产棉县和公社，还应尽可能扩大棉田的种植面积。
    坚持大检查大评比的群众运动，是胜利完成棉花播种任务的重要保证。河南省新乡市组织了万人播种大检查，开展了播种前的查墒情抓抗旱保墒、查工具抓检修改制、查种子抓精细处理、查劳动抓劳动组织、查地温抓适时播种的“五查五抓”运动，和播种中的比种足、比种好、比种适时的“三比”运动，这办法很好。
    领导棉花生产，要学会一手抓当前生产，一手抓下一阶段生产准备的工作方法。在检查棉花播种工作的同时，就必须结合检查出苗情况和过好保苗关的准备措施，使棉花高产运动不断发展，不断前进。
