The World is Developing According to Lenin's Predictions
Korean "Rodong Sinmun" Publishes Lenin's Quotes on Imperialism

    This newspaper reports: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published Lenin's remarks on imperialism on the fourth page on the 22nd, accounting for three-quarters of the page. The banner headline of this edition is: "Imperialism is Dying Capitalism."

    The Lenin's remarks collected by "Rodong Sinmun" are divided into two parts. The first part is titled: "The Historical Destiny of Imperialism"; the second part is titled: "American Imperialism is Heading for Destruction."

    The editorial department of "Rodong Sinmun" added an editor's note before Lenin's remarks. The full text of the editor's note is as follows:

    At present, the basic content of our era is the transition from capitalism to socialism, which began with the great October Socialist Revolution in Russia. Capitalism is rapidly declining and collapsing worldwide, and socialism is like the rising sun.

    Today, it further confirms that Lenin's thesis that imperialism is dying capitalism correctly defines the development of the world. At the same time, it also proves that the world is developing according to Lenin's predictions. Broad sections of people in the world, under the brilliant banner of Leninism, are looking for hope for their future.

    Today, under the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean people have embodied Lenin's thought in their actual lives, and have opened up a brilliant era of socialist prosperity and development in the northern half of the motherland, unprecedented in the history of the Korean nation.

  However, we have not yet achieved the unification of the motherland, and we are still directly confronting the world's arch-criminal of imperialism—American imperialism. The struggle between the Korean people and American imperialism reflects the contradiction between two forces: imperialism on one side, and the people of all countries in the world fighting for socialism, national independence, democracy, and peace on the other. American imperialism obstructs human progress in Seoul and around the world, carries out aggression and plunder, and threatens the world with a new atomic war. However, this is only the dying throes of a dying man. No matter how desperately the imperialists struggle, they cannot stop the process of the social development law that imperialism will eventually perish and socialism will triumph throughout the world.

    Leninism clearly explained this, and it has also been confirmed by history.

    On the occasion of commemorating the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth, it is of great significance for us to recall Lenin's series of theories on imperialism, on the characteristics of the development of imperialism and its historical status, on the inevitable demise of imperialism, and especially on American imperialism.

### 世界正按着列宁的预言发展  朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表列宁论述帝国主义的语录

    世界正按着列宁的预言发展
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表列宁论述帝国主义的语录
    本报讯　朝鲜“劳动新闻”22日在第四版以四分之三版的篇幅辑录了列宁关于论述帝国主义的言论。这一版的通栏大标题是：“帝国主义是垂死的资本主义”。
    “劳动新闻”辑录的列宁的言论分为两个部分，第一部分的标题是：“帝国主义的历史命运”；第二部分的标题是：“美帝国主义走向毁灭道路”。
    “劳动新闻”编辑部在列宁的言论前面加一按语，按语的全文如下：
    目前，我们时代的基本内容是从俄国的伟大十月社会主义革命开始的，由资本主义向社会主义的过渡。在世界范围内资本主义正在迅速没落和崩溃，社会主义正像初升的太阳一样。
    今天进一步证实了列宁的关于帝国主义是垂死的资本主义的论断正确地规定了世界的发展。同时，也证明了世界在按着列宁的预言发展着。世界上广大阶层的人民，在列宁主义的辉煌旗帜下，寻找着对自己前途的希望。
    今天朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的英明领导下，在实际生活中体现了列宁的思想，在祖国的北半部开辟了朝鲜民族历史上未曾有过的灿烂的社会主义繁荣发展的时代。
  但是，我们还没有实现祖国的统一，还同世界帝国主义的元凶——美帝国主义直接对峙着。朝鲜人民同美帝国主义之间的斗争反映了以帝国主义为一方，以为社会主义、民族独立、民主、和平而斗争的世界各国人民为另一方的两种势力之间的矛盾。美帝国主义在汉城和世界各地阻碍人类的进步，进行侵略和掠夺，使世界面临着新的原子战争的威胁。但是，这不过是垂死的最后的挣扎。不论帝国主义者如何疯狂挣扎，也挡不住帝国主义最后灭亡和社会主义在全世界胜利的社会发展规律的进程。
    列宁主义明白地说明了这一点，同时也被历史证实了。
    在纪念列宁诞辰九十周年的时候，回想一下列宁关于帝国主义、关于帝国主义发展的特点和所处的历史地位、关于帝国主义必将灭亡，特别是关于美帝国主义的一系列的理论，对我们来说是有重大意义的。
