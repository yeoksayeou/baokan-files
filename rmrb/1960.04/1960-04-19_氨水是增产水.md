On the basis of applying rural organic fertilizers, the application of chemical fertilizers can significantly increase yields. There are many types of chemical fertilizers, mainly divided into four categories: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements. Years of production practice have proven that nitrogenous fertilizers have the greatest yield-increasing effect among chemical fertilizers. It can achieve significant yield increases when applied to various crops on different soils. Each pound of nitrogen can increase rice production by about twenty pounds, wheat by fifteen pounds, cotton by ten pounds, and corn by thirty pounds. Therefore, the demand for nitrogen fertilizer is also the greatest. Currently, China mainly produces ammonium sulfate as nitrogen fertilizer. The method of producing ammonium sulfate is to first produce synthetic ammonia and then neutralize it with sulfuric acid. Every hundred pounds of ammonium sulfate contains about seventy-eight pounds of sulfuric acid, so the production of ammonium sulfate consumes a large amount of sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid has no effect when applied to the ground. China's chemical industry is developing rapidly, and the demand for sulfuric acid is very high. Therefore, mass production of ammonium sulfate is limited and uneconomical. However, the production of ammonia water eliminates the need for sulfuric acid neutralization and is not subject to the above conditions, enabling a large increase in the supply of nitrogen fertilizer in a short period.

After World War II, countries around the world began to pay attention to the production and application of liquid fertilizers such as ammonia water. As early as 1932-1933, the Soviet Union began testing the fertilizer effect of ammonia water. Currently, socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Poland also produce and apply large quantities of liquid nitrogen fertilizers such as ammonia water.

In 1958, after the communization of China's people's communes, rural industries – local fertilizer production – developed rapidly. Indigenous methods of manufacturing calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer and using alum stone and bittern to manufacture potash fertilizer were successful. They played a significant role in supplementing phosphate and potash fertilizers. However, in terms of nitrogen fertilizer, since the indigenous method of manufacturing saltpeter is mostly used in industry and mining, and the areas producing saltpeter soil are mostly limited to North and Northwest China, it is currently necessary to research and create varieties of nitrogen fertilizer suitable for indigenous production throughout the country.

In 1958, the Ministry of Chemical Industry designed a synthetic ammonia plant with an annual output of 800 tons, suitable for county-level operation. Synthetic ammonia is made by using nitrogen in the air and hydrogen in water under high temperature and pressure. Air and water are inexhaustible raw materials, and nitrogen fertilizer can be made with only coal and electricity. A small ammonia plant with an annual output of 800 tons of ammonia (equivalent to 659 tons of nitrogen) produces 4,000 tons of ammonia water annually (containing 0.20% ammonia). If the application rate is 40 catties per mu, it is enough for 200,000 mu of land, and it can increase grain production by 26 million to 32 million catties, or cotton by 13 million catties each year. By vigorously advocating pig raising and manure accumulation and applying large amounts of organic fertilizer, the widespread use of ammonia water will rapidly increase China's agricultural output.

Ammonia is a gas with a pungent odor at normal temperature and pressure. Its chemical composition is nitrogen and hydrogen; one part nitrogen and three parts hydrogen combine into ammonia under high temperature and pressure. Gaseous ammonia can become a liquid under fifteen atmospheres of pressure, called liquid ammonia, containing 82% nitrogen and 18% hydrogen, which is the most concentrated nitrogen fertilizer. However, its storage and transportation require high-pressure resistant containers, which is not very convenient for current use. Currently, what is widely promoted in China is ammonia water, which is made by dissolving ammonia in water. It is a colorless liquid containing 15%-18% nitrogen. Ammonia water does not require pressure-resistant containers, but it must be protected from volatilization. Ammonia water produced by coking plants contains impurities such as sulfur, so it is yellowish-green.

Ammonia dissolves in water to produce ammonium hydroxide, which is a weakly alkaline solution. In ammonia water, in addition to ammonium hydroxide molecules, most of the ammonia exists in its original state (molecules) in the water, so it is unstable and easily volatilizes. The special pungent odor of ammonia water is caused by the volatilization of ammonia. Ammonia water is slightly lighter than water. Ammonia water containing 18.6% ammonia has a specific gravity of 0.930, and ammonia water containing 25.65% has a specific gravity of 0.908.

The higher the concentration of ammonia water, the lighter the specific gravity, and the higher the temperature, the more ammonia volatilizes. According to experiments, ammonia water containing 15% ammonia (containing 140 grams of ammonia per liter), when left open for 1 hour at a temperature of 9 degrees, loses 49.5 grams of ammonia. If the temperature rises to 30 degrees, the amount of ammonia lost is 55.7 grams. In the Lan'gu People's Commune of Fuxian County, Luda area, experiments showed that ammonia loss reached more than 90% when ammonia water was stored outdoors for two days at a temperature of 22-24 degrees Celsius. Therefore, sufficient attention should be paid to preventing ammonia volatilization during the transportation, storage, and use of ammonia water.

In order to reduce the volatility of ammonia water, carbon dioxide is passed through during the manufacturing of ammonia water to form ammonium carbonate. The volatility of ammonium carbonate solution is much smaller than that of ammonium hydroxide. Therefore, the ammonia water used in agriculture is best a solution of ammonium carbonate through which carbon dioxide has been passed.

According to large-scale usage and test data of ammonia water at home and abroad, when the application method is appropriate, the fertilizer effect of ammonia water is roughly equivalent to that of ammonium sulfate under the same nitrogen quantity.

In 1958 and 1959, the suburbs of Lushun and Dalian cities, and the people's communes of Xinjin County, Jin County, and Fuxian County in Liaoning Province used more than 3,300 tons of ammonia water in large areas. It was the earliest area in China to use ammonia water in large areas. It has accumulated a lot of experience in the transportation, storage, and application of ammonia water, setting an example for future promotion of ammonia water. After two years of use, the yield increase effect is very significant, and the masses generally believe that "ammonia water is a yield-increasing water."

In 1959, the Shanhou Production Brigade of the Sanli Fort People's Commune in Jin County applied 25 catties of ammonia water per mu of corn land, with a yield of 565.9 catties per mu, while the yield without ammonia water was 409.6 catties per mu, an increase of 38%. In 1958, the Malan River Production Brigade of the Red Flag Commune in the Shahekou District conducted an ammonia water fertilizer effect test on apples. Each apple tree was applied with six catties of ammonia water, and the yield was 286.2 catties. Each apple tree was applied with six catties of ammonium sulfate, and the yield was 284.3 catties. The yield without chemical fertilizer was 187.8 catties. In 1959, the Luda City Agricultural Science Research Institute conducted an ammonia water tomato fertilizer effect test. The results showed that the yield of ammonia water was 10,708 catties per mu, and the yield without ammonia water was 8,743 catties per mu. The ammonia water increased the yield by 22.4%.

In 1958, the Institute of Soil and Fertilizer of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences cooperated with the State-owned Lutai Farm in Hebei Province to conduct a large-scale ammonia water fertilizer effect and demonstration comparison. The Lutai Farm is located in the Bohai Sea area and is a large-scale mechanized farm with alkaline soil (pH around 8.5) and implements water-dry crop rotation. In 1958, a total of 350 tons of ammonia water was applied, covering an area of about 15,000 mu. It was used as base fertilizer and top dressing on rice, corn, sweet potatoes, beets, and sunflower crops, and the fertilizer effect was very good.

The Lutai Farm Ammonia Water Fertilizer Effect Comparison Test results are listed in the following table:
		Yield per mu (catties)
Crop	Fertilization Method	No Fertilizer	Apply Ammonium Sulfate	Apply Ammonia Water	Nitrogen applied per mu (catties)
Rice	Top Dressing	593.3		943.0		917.1		14.7
Rice	Base Fertilizer	956.6		1185.2		1121.7		6.4
Summer Corn	Base Fertilizer	254		548		583		16.0
Beet	Top Dressing	1531		——		1807		4.8
Sunflower	Top Dressing	102		——		188		4.8
It can be seen from the table that, regardless of dry land or rice paddy, the yield increase effect of ammonia water used as base fertilizer and top dressing is similar to that of ammonium sulfate with the same amount of nitrogen.

Ammonia water is a liquid fertilizer with volatile characteristics. The volatilization of ammonia not only causes fertilizer loss, but also scorches crop leaves due to contact with ammonia gas. Therefore, the application method of ammonia water is different from that of solid fertilizers. Preventing ammonia volatilization is the key issue, especially in summer when the temperature is high.

In dry land, ammonia water should be applied below the soil layer to prevent volatilization and loss of fertilizer. The Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences conducted experiments on the influence of ammonia water application depth and soil temperature on ammonia volatilization. The results showed that ammonia water should be applied in dry land at a depth of three inches or less. Sandy soil has less clay and a weaker ability to absorb ammonia, so the application depth should be slightly deeper than that of clay soil. Soil moisture and soil tillage fineness also affect the application depth of ammonia water. The wetter the soil, the greater the ability to absorb ammonia. If the soil moisture is insufficient or the tillage is rough, the application depth should be three to four inches or deeper.

Ammonia water can be used as a base fertilizer and top dressing in dry land. The amount used per mu is about 30 to 50 catties. After fertilization, it is required to immediately and tightly cover the soil to prevent ammonia loss. If manual trench application is used, it can be applied after diluting it with 20 to 40 times of water. If machines are used, the original liquid can be applied directly. Ammonia water should not come into contact with seeds and stems and leaves. When applying ammonia water during sowing or intertillage, the ammonia water should be 2-3 inches away from the seeds or plants.

The best way to apply ammonia water in dry land is to use fertilization machinery, which can not only improve work efficiency but also ensure fertilizer efficiency. The Zhejiang Agricultural Science Research Institute has tried applying it after mixing ammonia water with peat, and the fertilizer effect is very good. High-quality peat can absorb about 10 catties of ammonia or 50 catties of 20% ammonia water per 1,000 catties.

Ammonia water can be used as a base fertilizer in paddy fields. In winter drained paddy fields, use a fertilization machine to apply ammonia water to a soil layer three inches deep before irrigation. The amount used per mu is about 30 to 50 catties. It is best to irrigate on the same day after fertilization, and at the latest within five days. This can prevent the nitrification of ammoniacal nitrogen and preserve the fertilizer effect. The ammoniacal nitrogen in ammonia water can be adsorbed by soil colloids, and has the advantages of long-lasting fertilizer effect and large yield increase effect. Since the amount of ammoniacal nitrogen lost is very small after immediate irrigation after fertilization, it is not necessary to consider it. However, do not use ammonia water as a base fertilizer in sandy soil or severely leaky rice fields. Ammonia water can also be used as top dressing - uniformly apply ammonia water to the rice field before transplanting (it can flow in with irrigation water or be splashed after diluting ammonia water with water), and thoroughly harrow the soil to allow the soil particles to absorb ammonia to avoid volatilization or excessive concentration of ammonia water in local areas.

When using ammonia water as top dressing in paddy fields, a ammonia water bucket (the bucket should be tightly closed to prevent air leakage) can be placed at the irrigation inlet, and the ammonia water is introduced into the irrigation water through a rubber tube or bamboo tube, and flows in with the water. The amount used per mu is about 30 to 50 catties. The fertilizer effect is very good, and the fertilization efficiency is also high. It is best to add ammonia water at the beginning of irrigation, and the ammonia water should be used up just after the water is filled, so as to achieve uniform fertilization. The Lutai Farm uses this method to apply ammonia water on large areas of paddy fields. Combining ammonia water application with intertillage and weeding can allow ammonia to be absorbed by soil particles and reduce ammonia loss.

In areas with convenient water sources and the habit of applying manure water in the south, consider applying ammonia water diluted with water. There is no experience on how many times the water should be diluted. The general requirement is to apply the ammonia water by splashing after diluting it until the odor of ammonia is no longer smelled, so as to avoid scorching the rice leaves.

In summer, the water temperature in the paddy field is high and the weather is sultry. Pay attention to deepening the water layer and increasing the storage capacity at any time to prevent ammonia volatilization. In southern rice fields, the time of applying lime and applying ammonia water should be staggered, because ammonia volatilizes more severely in alkaline conditions. Applying ammonia water in rice fields has the effect of killing fish and crabs. Ammonia water cannot be applied in rice fields where fish are raised.

This year, the use of ammonia water will be promoted throughout the country. Under the leadership of the Party, with the superior system of people's communes, we will surely successfully complete the work of promoting the use of ammonia water.

    氨水是增产水
    中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所
    在施用农村有机肥料的基础上，加施化学肥料，可以显著提高产量。化学肥料种类很多，主要分氮素、磷素、钾素和微量元素等四大类。经过多年的生产实践证明，化学肥料以氮素化肥增产效果最大。它对各种作物在不同土壤上施用，都能获得显著的增产效果。每斤氮约可增产稻谷二十斤、小麦十五斤、籽棉十斤、玉米三十斤。因此，氮肥需要量也最多。目前我国生产氮肥以硫酸铵为主。生产硫酸铵的方法是先制成合成氨，再与硫酸中和而成。每一百斤硫酸铵中约含有七十八斤硫酸，所以生产硫酸铵要消耗大量硫酸。硫酸施在地里没有什么作用，我国化学工业发展速度很快，硫酸需要量很大，所以要大量生产硫酸铵就受到一定的限制，也是不经济的。而生产氨水免去用硫酸中和，不受上述条件的限制，能够在短时间内大量增加氮肥的供应。
    第二次世界大战后，世界各国开始注意氨水等液体肥料的生产和施用。早在1932—1933年，苏联就开始进行了氨水肥效的试验工作。目前，苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰等社会主义国家也大量生产和施用氨水等液体氮肥。
    1958年，我国人民公社化后，农村工业——土化肥生产得到了迅速的发展。土法制造钙镁磷肥，明矾石和苦卤制造钾肥，都获得了成功。对补充磷肥和钾肥，起了很大的作用。但是在氮肥方面，由于土法制造火硝多在工业和矿业上使用，产硝土的地区又多限于华北和西北。目前还需要研究创造适合于全国范围内，土法生产的氮肥的品种。
    化学工业部1958年设计了年产八百吨、适合县级兴办的合成氨厂。合成氨是利用空气中的和氮水中的氢在高温高压下制成的。空气和水是取之不尽的原料，只需要煤和电力，即可制成氮肥。一座年产八百吨氨（等于六百五十九吨氮）的小型氨厂，年产氨水四千吨（含氨0.20％）。如果每亩施用量为四十斤，就足够二十万亩地施用，每年可增产粮食二千六百至三千二百万斤，或籽棉一千三百万斤。在大力提倡养猪积肥和大量施用有机肥料的基础上，推广使用氨水，将迅速提高我国农业产量。
    氨在常温常压下是一种具有刺激性嗅味的气体。它的化学成份是氮和氢；一份氮和三份氢在高温高压下化合成氨。气体氨在十五个大气压下，可以成为液体，叫做液体氨，含氮82％，含氢18％，是含氮量最浓的肥料。但是由于贮存和运输需要耐高压的容器，在目前使用还不很方便。现在我国大量推广使用的是氨水，是将氨溶解在水中制成的。它是无色的液体，含氮15％—18％。氨水不需要耐压的容器，但是要防止挥发。炼焦厂生产的氨水因含有硫等杂质，所以带黄绿色。
    氨溶在水里产生氢氧化铵，是一种弱碱性溶液。氨水中除了有氢氧化铵分子外，氨多以原状态（分子）存在水中，所以不稳定，很容易挥发。氨水有特殊的刺激性嗅味，就是由于氨挥发所造成的。氨水比水稍轻，含氨18.6％的氨水比重是0.930，含氨25.65％，比重是0.908。
    氨水浓度越大，比重越轻，气温越高，氨的挥发就越多。根据试验，含氨15％的氨水（每公升含有140克氨），在9度的气温下，敞口放置1小时，丢失氨49.5克，若温度升高到30度，丢失氨量是55.7克。旅大地区复县兰谷人民公社试验在摄氏22—24度气温下，氨水露天存放两天，氨损失达90％以上。所以氨水在运输、贮存和使用时，防止氨的挥发应给以足够的重视。
    为了降低氨水的挥发性，在制造氨水时通入二氧化碳使成碳酸铵，碳酸铵溶液的挥发性比氢氧化铵小得多。所以农业上使用的氨水，最好是通入二氧化碳的碳酸铵溶液。
    根据国内外氨水大面积使用和试验资料证明，氨水使用方法适当，在等氮量的情况下，氨水肥效与硫酸铵大致相等。
    1958年和1959年辽宁省旅顺、大连地区的市郊和新金县、金县和复县各人民公社，曾在大面积中施用氨水三千三百多吨，是我国大面积施用氨水最早的地区，在氨水运输、贮存和施用方面取得了不少经验，为今后推广氨水树立了榜样。经过二年来的使用，增产效果很大，群众普遍认为“氨水是增产水”。
    1959年金县三十里堡人民公社山后生产大队玉米地，每亩施氨水二十五斤，亩产五百六十五点九斤，而不施氨水的亩产四百零九点六斤，增产38％。沙河口区红旗公社马栏河生产大队1958年进行苹果追施氨水肥效试验，每棵果树施氨水六斤，产量二百八十六点二斤，每棵苹果施硫酸铵六斤，产量二百八十四点三斤，不施化肥的产量一百八十七点八斤。1959年旅大市农业科学研究所进行氨水番茄肥效试验，结果施氨水的亩产一万零七百零八斤，不施氨水的亩产八千七百四十三斤，施氨水增产了22.4％。
    1958年中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所与河北省国营芦台农场合作进行了大面积氨水肥效和示范对比。芦台农场位于渤海区，是大型机械化农场，土壤碱性（酸碱度在八点五左右），实行水旱轮作。1958年共施用氨水三百五十吨，施肥面积约一万五千亩，在水稻、玉米、白薯、甜菜和向日葵作物上做基肥和追肥施用，肥效都很好。
    芦台农场氨水肥效对比试验结果列如下表：
                每亩产量（斤数）作　物　施肥方法　不施肥　施硫酸铵　施氨水  每亩施氮斤数水　稻　追　肥    593.3	　   943.0　 917.1　  14.7水　稻　基　肥	  956.6　   1185.2　 1121.7  　6.4夏玉米　基　肥	  254	  　   548　    583　 16.0甜　菜　追　肥	  1531　　    ——　   1807　　4.8向日葵　追　肥　  102　     　——　    188　　4.8从表中可以看出，不论旱田或水稻田，氨水用作基肥和追肥增产效果都和等氮量硫酸铵相仿。
    氨水是一种液体肥料，具有挥发的特性，氨的挥发，不但肥效损失，由于氨气接触作物，还会熏伤作物叶子。所以氨水施用方法与固体肥料不同，防止氨挥发是关键性的问题，尤其是在夏天气温高的时候更应注意这一点。
    在旱田应把氨水施在土层下面，以免挥发，丢失肥分。山西省农业科学院进行氨水施肥深度与土壤温度对氨挥发的影响试验，试验结果表明，旱田施氨水应在深度三寸或三寸以下，砂质土粘粒少吸附氨的能力较差，施肥深度应比粘质土壤稍深些。土壤水分和土壤耕耙细度对施用氨水深度也有关系，土壤越湿吸附氨的能力越大。土壤水分不足或耕耙较粗的情况下，施肥深度应在三—四寸或更深些。
    氨水可用做旱田基肥和追肥，每亩用量约为三十至五十斤，施肥后要求立即严密复土以防止氨的丢失。若采用人工开沟条施，可兑水二十至四十倍后施用，若是采用机具，可以直接施用原液。氨水不能与种子和茎叶接触，在播种或中耕施用氨水时，氨水与种子或植株，要有2—3寸的距离。
    旱田施用氨水最好是采用施肥机具，既可以提高工效，又可保证肥效。浙江省农业科学研究所曾试用草炭混拌氨水后施用，肥效很好，质量好的草炭每千斤约可吸收氨十斤或20％的氨水五十斤。
    水田可用氨水做基肥。冬季落水田在灌水前用施肥机把氨水施在三寸深的土层中，每亩用量约为三十至五十斤。施肥后最好当天灌水，最迟不超过五天。这样可以防止氨态氮硝化，保存肥效。氨水中氨态氮可以被土壤胶体吸附，有肥效持久、增产效果大的优点。施肥后立即灌水，氨态氮流失数量很少，可以不必考虑。但在砂性土或漏水严重的水稻田不要用氨水做基肥。氨水也可以用做面肥——插秧前把氨水均匀施入稻田中（随灌水流入或把氨水加水稀释后泼施均可），并进行充分耙地使土粒把氨吸附，以避免挥发或局部地方氨水过浓。
    水田用氨水做追肥时，可在灌水口地方，放一个氨水桶（桶要密闭，不跑气），用胶皮管或竹管把氨水引入灌水中随水流入，每亩用量约为三十至五十斤，肥效很好，施肥工效也高。最好在灌水开始就加氨水，水灌完毕氨水也恰好用完，这样可以达到施肥均匀。芦台农场在大面积水稻田上施用氨水就是采用这种方法。结合中耕除草施氨水，氨可以被土粒吸附，减少氨的丢失。
    南方水源方便并有施用粪水习惯的地区，可以考虑加水稀释氨水办法施用。要加多少倍的水才适合，现在还没有经验。总的要求是把氨水稀释到闻不到氨的臭味后泼施，即可以避免熏伤稻叶。
    夏天稻田水温较高，天气闷热，应随时注意加深水层和增加蓄水量来防止氨挥发。南方水稻田，施石灰与施氨水的时间应错开，因为在碱性情况下，氨挥发得更厉害。稻田中施用氨水有杀死鱼蟹的作用。在养鱼的稻田中，不可施用氨水。
    今年将在全国范围内开始推广使用氨水。在党的领导下，有了人民公社的优越制度，一定能把推广氨水的使用工作胜利完成。
