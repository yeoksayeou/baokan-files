    Valuable Material for Studying Shanghai's Ancient History
    Shanghai Historians Discuss the Significance of Excavating the Maqiao Ancient Ruins
    To study the value of excavating the Maqiao ancient cultural site for researching Shanghai's ancient history, the Shanghai Historical Society recently held a symposium for discussion. The Maqiao ancient cultural site was discovered in December of last year by the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Relics Preservation Committee on the north bank of the Yutang River in the Maqiao People's Commune, Shanghai County. It contains a large number of important cultural relics and remains, such as stone tools, bone tools, pottery, animal bones, bronzes, plant seeds, burnt pits, and tombs. These discoveries provide a batch of extremely valuable physical materials for the study of Shanghai's ancient history.
    During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that this discovery is of extremely important political significance and scientific value for the study of Shanghai's ancient history. In the past, Shanghai's history was generally recorded as beginning with the establishment of a town in the Southern Song Dynasty and a county in the Yuan Dynasty. As for going further back, there were only some scattered legends. Before liberation, influenced by the arbitrary speculation of some bourgeois scholars at home and abroad, it was generally believed that the Shanghai land was formed in relatively recent times. The discovery of the Maqiao cultural site not only pushes Shanghai's history back by more than a thousand years but also thoroughly shatters the above-mentioned erroneous assertions.
    Everyone believes that the significance of the Maqiao site excavation also lies in the fact that, judging from the characteristics of the unearthed cultural relics, these relics have certain connections with the unearthed cultural relics of the Liangzhu Laoheshan site in Zhejiang, the Yinyangying site in Nanjing, and the sites in Jiangsu, Fujian, and other places, and are also influenced by the Shandong Longshan culture. Therefore, this will fill a blank spot in the systematic study of the culture of the southeastern region, and also provide a connecting link for the study of the relationship and influence between southern and northern cultures.
    Regarding the age of the site, there were different opinions at the meeting. Many comrades believed that it was equivalent to the Shang and Zhou dynasties, while others believed that it could be pushed back to the Yin and Shang dynasties, and individual comrades believed that it should be postponed to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Currently, this site is still under excavation, so it is not yet possible to conduct a comprehensive investigation and make a definitive judgment on the age.

    研究上海古代史的珍贵材料
    上海史学界探讨发掘马桥古遗址的意义
    为了研究发掘马桥古文化遗址对研究上海古代历史的价值，上海史学会最近召开座谈会进行了讨论。马桥古文化遗址是去年12月上海市文物保管委员会在上海县马桥人民公社俞塘河北岸发现的，其中有大量石器、骨器、陶器、动物骨胳、青铜器、植物种子、烧坑和墓葬等重要文物和遗迹。这些发现，为上海古代史的研究提供了一批极珍贵的实物资料。
    讨论中大家一致认为这个发现对研究上海古代史有极重要的政治意义和科学价值。上海的历史，过去一般记载都是南宋设镇，元代设县，至于再往前推，就只有一些零星的传说。在解放以前，受到国内外一些资产阶级学者随意臆测的影响，一般总认为上海的地面是在较近的年代中形成的。马桥文化遗址的发现，不仅把上海历史推前了千余年，也彻底地击破了上述的错误论断。
    大家认为，马桥遗址发掘的意义还在于：从出土文物的特征来看，这些文物与浙江良渚老和山遗址、南京阴阳营遗址，以及江苏、福建等地遗址的出土文物都有一定联系，同时也受了山东龙山文化的影响。因此，这将为系统地研究东南地区文化填补一个空白点，同时也为研究南方与北方文化之间的关系和影响提供了连接的纽带。
    关于遗址的年代，会上有不同的意见。不少同志认为相当于商周时代，也有同志认为可以推前到殷商，个别同志认为应推迟到春秋战国时代。目前这个遗址还正在发掘中，因此还不能作全面的考察和对年代作出确切的论断。
