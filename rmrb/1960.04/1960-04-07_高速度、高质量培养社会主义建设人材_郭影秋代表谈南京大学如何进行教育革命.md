Fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian. Now, I would like to share some opinions on how Nanjing University, as a higher education institution, conducts educational revolution and cultivates talents for socialist construction.

Under the leadership of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee, Nanjing University has made great achievements in implementing the Party's education policy. These include: consolidating the Party's leadership in school work, launching mass movements in teaching work, and establishing a teaching order that combines teaching, labor, and scientific research; thus enabling students to achieve all-round development in moral, intellectual, and physical education, and significantly improving the quality of teaching. After studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the entire school is filled with vigor and vitality, with the masses fighting valiantly to deepen the educational revolution.

Establishing Bases for Labor Training

Incorporating productive labor into the education plan is one of the main achievements of the educational revolution. Over the past year, we have established eleven intermediate factories and a comprehensive farm, which have become important labor training bases for all teachers and students. In addition, the various departments of liberal arts have been linked to factories and people's communes, participating in labor training and supporting industrial and agricultural production; while the departments of geography, geology, meteorology, and biology have successively established labor bases in the subtropical regions of Yunnan, the Three Gorges area of the Yangtze River, the Qaidam Basin in the Northwest, and the coastal areas of the Southeast, directly undertaking national tasks, and supporting the production and construction cause in terms of exploration, mineral prospecting, surveying, and cultivation. In extensive field labor, they have completed production tasks, completed teaching tasks combined with production, and completed a large number of significant scientific research tasks combined with production labor. Teaching quality has significantly improved wherever productive labor is well implemented.

The improvement of teaching quality is primarily reflected in the fact that students have learned comprehensive knowledge that combines theory and practice through productive labor. In the past, manufacturing complex instruments and producing cutting-edge products were considered unattainable, but now they have gradually become common knowledge for college students in related majors. Productive labor has promoted scientific research work. Teachers, students, and workers, under the leadership of the Party committee, have combined to vigorously engage in research work, becoming an important force in scientific research. Strengthening productive labor and carrying out scientific research work have also greatly deepened and consolidated students' basic theoretical knowledge. The phenomenon of students repeating grades has been greatly reduced, and course examination results have improved quarter by quarter. In the final semester examination last year, 73.95% of the students in the school achieved excellent results, exceeding the examination results of any period before the Great Leap Forward. As for the textbooks, experimental lecture notes, and various papers and reports co-written by teachers and students, most of them are of a certain level, which is further evidence of the improvement of theoretical knowledge.

When measuring teaching quality, it is important to see the changes in the mental outlook of teachers and students. Through labor training, the ideological awareness of teachers and students has been improved, and they have gone a long way from looking down on workers and peasants to integrating with them and advancing towards the path of intellectual laborization. Students who go to the countryside and factories eat, live, and work with the workers and peasants. In contact with the workers and peasants, they deeply realize that "what kind of roots grow what kind of shoots, what class speaks what kind of words," and receive vivid and practical education on class viewpoints, labor viewpoints, and mass viewpoints, and cultivate the class feelings of the working people. The teachers and students working in the field put down their airs, carry their luggage and tools on their backs, and brave the scorching sun and severe cold. They fight in the deep mountains and wild ridges and the vast desert, often encouraging themselves with the heroic slogan "Thirsty, think of Shangganling; hungry, think of the Red Army," overcoming dangers and fatigue, and carrying out field work with enthusiasm. Here, we can see the growth of the communist moral qualities of the vast number of teachers and students.

After more than a year of effort, productive labor has taken root, sprouted, blossomed, and borne fruit in universities and colleges. The development and changes of things themselves have shattered all the slanders and attacks by domestic and foreign hostile forces against the Party's general line for socialist construction and the Party's education policy.

Four Points of Experience

We have the following experiences in our work:

First, we must strengthen the Party's leadership and adhere to putting politics in command in order to overcome difficulties and move forward continuously.

The educational revolution is part of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front. In the course of development, it will inevitably encounter resistance from bourgeois educational ideology and habitual forces. Therefore, we must strengthen the Party's leadership and resolutely carry out the struggle between the two roads, the two ideologies, and the two methods, and advance in the struggle. The focus of the struggle is: the road and method of cultivating talents, is it the white and expert road or the red and expert road? The teaching and scientific research line, is it the expert line or the mass line? The content and form of teaching, is it the combination of education and productive labor or the separation? The academic thought and disciplinary system, is it the idealistic viewpoint or the dialectical materialist viewpoint? This struggle has been continuing. Every time the work enters a new stage, it is often accompanied by a major or minor ideological and theoretical struggle. Through struggle, people's ideological outlook has changed, and various practical difficulties in the work have also been overcome. Experience has proved that the victory of every task is always achieved after overcoming difficulties, and what plays a decisive role in this is people's thinking. As long as we put politics in command and exert great efforts, we will be invincible.

Second, only by adopting the working method of the mass line in teaching work can we complete teaching tasks in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

Compared with the production front, teaching work certainly has its own characteristics. However, the mass line is the Party's fundamental line in all work. Teaching work must adopt the method of the mass line in order to be more, faster, better, and more economical. The achievements we have made in teaching, productive labor, and scientific research over the past year have been inseparable from vigorously carrying out mass movements and following the mass line. Without the mass line, we cannot break through the old teaching order; without the mass line, we cannot change the deserted research method; without the mass line, we cannot fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and complete all tasks in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously carry out mass movements in school work. In the movement, we must generally grasp three links: First, grasp the revolutionary demands of the masses, establish clear goals of effort in a certain period, put forward clear slogans, and guide the masses to move forward continuously. Second, conduct in-depth ideological work and meticulous organizational work according to the actual situation, so that the work is both vigorous and down-to-earth. Third, do a good job of the three-way combination of teachers and students under the leadership of the Party committee, mobilize all positive factors, which is an important form of implementing the mass line in schools, and also a necessary prerequisite for carrying out mass movements and achieving practical results in work.

Third, constantly adjust the arrangement of teaching, labor, and scientific research, and constantly improve the quality of teaching.

Improving the quality of teaching is a continuous arrangement and in-depth development process. First of all, we must do a good job in the basic arrangement of teaching, labor, and scientific research, so that the three become a whole in the teaching process; then, do a good job in the organic combination of the three in terms of content, so that they can promote and serve each other. Secondly, we must constantly overcome the weak links in the teaching process, solve the problems of the weight of the course content and the relationship between connection and cooperation, so that each course (including labor courses) can develop relatively balanced. Again, we must carry out meticulous investigation and research work, find out the key courses for improving the quality of teaching in each major, and vigorously carry out innovation work from textbook content to teaching organization to teaching conditions and teaching methods, accumulate teaching experience, and gradually complete the task of the entire curriculum reform.

Fourth, grasp the principle of active balance, constantly balance to higher levels, and promote the sustained leap forward of all school work.

There is no end to improving the quality of teaching, and the educational revolution must not stop here; at the same time, solving the urgent problems of a certain period is also staged, and the quality of education must be improved step by step. The development of school work is also like the development of the national economy, experiencing a process of development from imbalance to balance and then to imbalance. For example, before the educational revolution, the old teaching order had a "relative balance" of less, slower, worse, and more expensive. In 1958, we vigorously engaged in productive labor, broke the old teaching order, and there was an imbalance. In 1959, we focused on teaching, made comprehensive arrangements for teaching, labor, scientific research, and the lives of teachers and students, established a new teaching order, and achieved relative balance. Since this semester, on the premise of focusing on teaching, we have strengthened scientific research work and actively innovated teaching content. Teaching and productive labor are bound to undergo new changes and new imbalances. In this way, breaking and then establishing, establishing and then breaking, breaking and establishing combined, spiraling upward development, constantly balancing to higher levels, each iteration reaching a more complete and more improved level than the previous stage, teaching work and other tasks are constantly advancing one after another.

Carry the Educational Revolution to the End

Our school has achieved results in carrying out the educational revolution, but it has not developed "to the top." On the contrary, the new situation of sustained leap forward in China's national economy increasingly requires the development of science and technology, and increasingly requires universities and colleges to cultivate theoretical and technical talents for the country at high speed and with high quality. We must not be satisfied with the achievements we have made, we must not stay at the existing level of work, but should continue to move forward without stopping and carry the educational revolution to the end.

Education serves proletarian politics, and the primary issue is to serve the current socialist revolution and socialist construction. Our opinion is to develop and improve simultaneously on the premise of continued improvement, that is: on the one hand, actively innovate teaching content and constantly improve the quality of teaching; on the other hand, vigorously run amateur and correspondence education, and take various measures to cultivate theoretical and technical cadres for production departments and newly built universities and colleges. The productive labor time of the liberal arts departments should be appropriately increased, and labor bases should be established in the people's communes with the department as the unit to vigorously support agricultural production and rural cultural work; the scientific research topics of the science departments should devote a certain amount of effort to facing the countryside, promoting rural technical innovation and technical revolution movements. More work needs to be done in this area in the future.

Constantly innovating teaching content is one of the main issues in deepening the educational revolution. Although we have made some efforts in this regard over the past year, we have not had time to completely transform it from the curriculum system. A lot of new content has been introduced, but not much old content has been removed. If this continues, it will inevitably increase the learning burden and prolong the teaching process, resulting in unnecessary waste in energy and time. Therefore, the planned innovation of teaching content has become a major task for school work in the future. Our initial opinion is: In terms of major settings, we should develop cutting-edge disciplines and add new majors in sets; in terms of course settings, we should adjust old courses and add new courses, so that students can learn solid basic theories and master the latest scientific achievements; in terms of course content, we should use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to rewrite outlines and textbooks, and innovate the content of various disciplines in a planned and step-by-step manner. In addition, we must also vigorously improve the teaching organization and teaching methods, so that students can obtain newer and greater learning results in the shortest time. The innovation of teaching content is a new development in the educational revolution. Although such a major task certainly requires a process and a certain amount of time, if we are limited to the old framework and do not change it, we cannot continue to leap forward.

Cultivate Teachers While Teaching and Learning

The revolution and construction on the education front must be carried out simultaneously, and cultivating a team of teachers who are both red and expert and armed with Mao Zedong Thought is the central key to ensuring the continuous improvement of teaching quality. Our requirements for cultivation are to put politics in command and unify politics and business; the methods of cultivation are to adopt diversified forms according to professional characteristics and work needs, combining off-the-job advanced studies outside the school with on-the-job improvement in the school, with in-school cultivation as the main focus; combining the improvement of older teachers with the cultivation of new forces, with the cultivation of new forces as the main focus. The general principle is to learn while doing and grow in combat.

Improving teaching and scientific research conditions is an important measure to improve the quality of teaching. We strive to fundamentally change the outdated and backward state of teaching and research equipment within three years to meet the requirements of teaching content innovation. The way to improve is to run schools diligently and thriftily, rely on our own efforts, carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, give full play to the enthusiasm and subjective initiative of all teachers and students, and manufacture most or all of the electronic instruments ourselves, and equip the cutting-edge discipline laboratories with the latest equipment first, and then gradually transform all experimental equipment, so that students can receive the latest experimental technology and method training during their studies.

To achieve the above-mentioned task of innovating teaching content, it is inevitable to thoroughly break the bourgeois educational thought and academic thought system and establish a socialist educational thought and academic thought system. Therefore, earnestly studying Mao Zedong Thought and transforming our world outlook has become an important task for promoting the continuous development of the educational revolution. Now, studying Mao Zedong Thought has become a conscious demand of the vast number of teachers and students. Through the study of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, everyone has further deeply realized that: if we act according to Mao Zedong Thought, we will be invincible in both work and study; if we do not act according to Mao Zedong Thought, work and study will not improve and may even make mistakes. This is the case in leadership work, and it is also the case in teaching and scientific research work. In the past, some people thought that natural science had no class nature and did not need to study Mao Zedong Thought. Now, they have gradually realized that without studying Mao Zedong Thought, it is difficult to get rid of the limitations of research work, and it is impossible to truly grasp the general laws of academic changes and development in the scientific field. Earnestly studying Mao Zedong Thought is a fundamental guarantee for transforming ideology, improving work, and completing the tasks of the educational revolution.

The tasks we face are arduous and glorious. Under the great situation of sustained leap forward, as long as we hold high the red flag of the general line, strengthen the Party's leadership, and adhere to the mass line, we will surely be able to complete the above tasks and achieve greater victories in implementing the Party's education policy.

    高速度、高质量培养社会主义建设人材
    郭影秋代表谈南京大学如何进行教育革命各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告。现在，我就一个高等学校——南京大学，关于进行教育革命、培养社会主义建设人材的问题，发表一点意见。
    南京大学在中共江苏省委和江苏省人民委员会的领导下，贯彻执行党的教育方针以来，取得了巨大成绩。这就是：巩固了党在学校工作的领导，开展了教学工作的群众运动，建立了教学、劳动、科学研究三结合的教学秩序；因而使学生在德育、智育、体育方面获得全面发展，教学质量有了显著提高。学习党的八届八中全会文件以后，全校出现一片朝气勃勃的景象，群众斗志昂扬，正在为深入教育革命而奋勇前进。
    建立基地劳动锻炼
    生产劳动列入教育计划，是教育革命的主要成果之一。一年多来，我们成立了十一个中间工厂和一个综合性的农场，成为全校师生重要的劳动锻炼基地。此外，文科各系分别和工厂、人民公社挂了钩，参加劳动锻炼并支援工农业生产；而地理、地质、气象、生物各系，则在云南亚热带地区，长江三峡地区，西北柴达木地区以及东南沿海地区，先后建立了劳动基地，直接承担国家任务，从勘探、找矿、调查、培育各方面支援生产建设事业。他们在广泛的野外劳动中，完成了生产任务，完成了结合生产的教学任务，结合生产劳动完成了大量的、有分量的科学研究任务。凡是生产劳动搞得好的，教学质量都有显著提高。
    教学质量的提高，首先表现在学生通过生产劳动的实践，学到了理论与实际相结合的全面知识。过去认为制造复杂仪器、生产尖端产品是高不可攀的事情，现在已逐渐变为有关专业大学生的常识。生产劳动推动了科学研究工作，教师、学生、工人在党委领导下结合起来，大搞研究工作，成为科学研究中的一支重要力量。加强生产劳动与开展科学研究工作，也大大加深和巩固了学生的基础理论知识，学生留级现象，大为减少；课程考试成绩，逐季提高。去年年底学期考试，全校学生获得优良成绩的73.95％，超过大跃进以前任何时期的考试成绩。至于师生合作编写的教材，实验讲义以及各种论文和报告，大多具有一定水平，这更是理论知识提高的明证。
    在衡量教学质量时，重要的还要看到师生精神面貌的改变。通过劳动锻炼，师生的思想觉悟提高了，由轻视工农群众变为和工农群众打成一片，向知识分子劳动化的途程前进了一大步。下乡下厂的同学，与工农群众同吃、同住、同劳动，在和工农群众接触中，他们深切体会到：“什么根子长什么芽，什么阶级说什么话”，受到生动实际的阶级观点、劳动观点、群众观点的教育，培养了劳动人民的阶级感情。在野外工作的师生，他们放下架子，身背行李和工具，不避烈日酷暑，不畏暴风严寒，战斗在深山野岭和广阔无垠的沙漠中，常以“口渴想起上甘岭，饥饿想起老红军”的豪迈口号鼓舞自己，战胜险阻和疲困，热情洋溢地进行野外工作。这里可以看出广大师生共产主义道德品质的成长。
    经过一年多的努力，生产劳动已经在高等学校中生根发芽，开花结果，事物发展变化的本身，粉碎了国内外敌对势力对于党的社会主义建设总路线和党的教育方针的一切污蔑和攻击。
    四点体会
    我们在工作中有如下体会：
    第一，必须加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，才能战胜困难，不断前进。
    教育革命是政治思想战线上社会主义革命的一部分，在发展过程中，不可避免地要遭到资产阶级教育思想和习惯势力的反抗。因此，必须加强党的领导，坚决开展两条道路、两种思想和两种方法的斗争，在斗争中前进。斗争的焦点是：培养人才的道路和方法，是白专道路还是红专道路？教学与科学研究路线，是专家路线还是群众路线？教学的内容和形式，是教育与生产劳动相结合还是相分离？学术思想和学科体系，是唯心主义观点还是辩证唯物主义观点？这种斗争一直继续着，每逢工作进入一个新的阶段，伴随着而来的往往有一场或大或小的思想斗争和理论斗争。通过斗争改变了人的思想面貌，同时也克服了工作中的各种实际困难。经验证明：每项工作的胜利，总是在克服了困难以后取得的，其中起决定作用的是人的思想。只要政治挂帅，大鼓干劲，便会无往而不胜。
    第二，只有在教学工作中采取群众路线的工作方法，才能多快好省地完成教学任务。
    教学工作和生产战线相比，固然有其本身的特点，但是，群众路线是党在一切工作中的根本路线，教学工作必须采取群众路线的方法，才能有多快好省。一年多来，我们在教学、生产劳动和科学研究各方面所取得的成绩，都是和大搞群众运动、走群众路线分不开的。没有群众路线就不能冲破旧的教学秩序，没有群众路线就不能改变冷冷清清的研究方法，没有群众路线就不能充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，多快好省地完成一切任务。所以，在学校工作中大搞群众运动是必须的。运动中一般要掌握三个环节：其一，是把握住群众的革命要求，一定的时期，树立明确的努力目标，提出鲜明的口号，引导群众不断前进。其二，是根据实际情况，进行深入的思想工作和细致的组织工作，使工作既是轰轰烈烈，又是踏踏实实。其三，做好党委领导下的教师、学生三结合，调动一切积极因素，这是学校中贯彻群众路线的重要形式，也是搞好群众运动取得工作实效的必要前提。
    第三，不断调整教学、劳动、科学研究三者的安排，不断提高教学质量。
    提高教学质量是一个不断安排、不断深入的发展过程。首先，要做好教学、劳动和科学研究的基本安排，使三者在教学过程中成为一个整体；进而做好这三者在内容上的有机结合，使之相互促进，相互为用。其次，不断克服教学过程中的薄弱环节，解决课程内容的分量轻重和衔接配合关系，使各门课程（包括劳动课）能够相对均衡的发展。再次，进行细致的调查研究工作，找出各个专业提高教学质量的关键性的课程，从教材内容到教学组织以至教学条件、教学方法，大力进行革新工作，积累教学经验，逐步完成整个课程改革的任务。
    第四，掌握积极平衡的原则，不断向高处平衡，推动学校一切工作持续跃进。
    提高教学质量是没有止境的，教育革命决不能到此为止；同时，解决一定时期的迫切问题又是有阶段的，教育质量必须一步步的提高。学校工作的发展也和国民经济的发展一样，经历着不平衡到平衡再到不平衡的发展过程。例如，在教育革命以前，旧的教学秩序存在着少慢差费的“相对平衡”。1958年，我们大搞生产劳动，打破了旧的教学秩序，出现了不平衡。1959年，我们以教学为主，对教学、劳动、科学研究、师生生活等方面作了全面安排，建立了新的教学秩序，达到相对平衡。本学期以来，我们在以教学为主的前提下，加强了科学研究工作，积极革新教学内容，教学与生产劳动势必又起新的变化，出现新的不平衡。如此，破而又立，立而又破，破中有立，破立结合，螺旋式地向上发展，不断向高处平衡，每一次反复，都达到比前一阶段更加完备和更加提高的程度，教学工作和其他各项工作，就是这样一环扣一环地不断前进。
    把教育革命进行到底
    我校进行教育革命有成绩，但是并没有发展“到顶”。适相反，我国国民经济持续跃进的新形势，越来越需要科学技术的发展，越来越需要高等学校高速度、高质量的为国家培养理论技术人材。我们决不能满足于既得的成就，决不能停留在现有的工作水平，而应一步不停地继续前进，把教育革命进行到底。
    教育为无产阶级政治服务，首要问题是为当前的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业服务。我们的意见，是在继续提高的前提下，发展与提高并举，即：一方面积极革新教学内容，不断提高教学质量；另方面又要大办业余、函授教育，采取多种措施，为生产部门及新建高等学校培养理论技术干部。文科各系的生产劳动时间要适当增加，以系为单位在人民公社建立劳动基地，大力支援农业生产及农村文化工作；理科各系的科学研究选题，拿出一定力量面向农村，推动农村技术革新和技术革命运动的开展。在这方面，今后要做更多的工作。
    不断革新教学内容，这是深入教育革命的主要问题之一。一年多来，我们在这方面虽然作了一些努力，但还没有来得及从课程体系上加以彻底改造。新内容引进不少，旧内容革除不多，这样下去，势必增加学习负担，延长教学过程，在精力和时间上形成不必要的浪费。所以，有计划地革新教学内容，就成为今后学校工作的重大任务。我们的初步意见是：在专业设置方面，应当发展尖端学科，成套地添设新专业；在课程设置方面，应当调整老课程，增设新课程，使学生既能学到坚实的基础理论，又能掌握最新的科学成就；在课程内容方面，要以毛泽东思想为指导，改写大纲和教材，有计划、有步骤地革新各门学科的内容。此外，在教学组织、教学方法方面也要大力改进，使学生能用最短的时间，获得更新更大的学习成果。教学内容的革新是教育革命的新发展，对待这样重大的任务，固然需要一个过程和一定时间，但若因此而限于老框框不去改变，那便不能持续跃进。
    边教边学培养师资
    教育战线上的革命和建设必须同时并举，培养一支又红又专的，用毛泽东思想武装起来的师资队伍，是保证不断提高教学质量的中心关键。我们培养的要求是政治挂帅，政治与业务统一；培养的方法是根据专业特点和工作需要，采取多样化的形式，校外脱产进修与校内在职提高并举，以校内培养为主；提高老年教师与培养新生力量并举，以培养新生力量为主。总的原则是边干边学，在战斗中成长。
    改善教学和科学研究条件，是提高教学质量的重要措施。我们力争在三年内根本改变教学研究设备的陈旧落后状态，以适应教学内容革新的要求。改善的办法是勤俭办学，自力更生，开展技术革新和技术革命运动，充分发挥全体师生的积极性和主观能动作用，自己制造大部分或全套电子仪器，以最新设备首先装备尖端学科实验室，然后逐步改造一切实验设备。使学生在学习期间能够得到最新的实验技术和方法的训练。
    实现上述革新教学内容的任务，必然是大破资产阶级的教育思想和学术思想体系，建立社会主义的教育思想和学术思想体系，因之，认真学习毛泽东思想，改造我们的世界观，就成为推动教育革命不断发展的重要任务。现在，学习毛泽东思想已成为广大师生的自觉要求。通过党的八届八中全会文件学习，大家更进一步深刻体会到：按照毛泽东思想办事，不论工作、学习都无往而不胜；不按照毛泽东思想办事，工作、学习都无起色甚至犯了错误。在领导工作上如此，在教学和科学研究工作上也是如此。过去有些人以为自然科学没有阶级性，用不着学习毛泽东思想，现在也渐渐感觉到，不学习毛泽东思想就很难摆脱研究工作的局限性，就不能真正掌握科学领域内学术变化发展的一般规律。认真学习毛泽东思想，是改造思想、改进工作和完成教育革命任务的根本保证。
    我们面临的任务是艰巨的，也是光荣的。在持续跃进的大好形势下，只要我们高举总路线红旗，加强党的领导，坚持群众路线，一定可以完成上述各项任务，在贯彻执行党的教育方针上获得更大的胜利。
