Chairman, fellow representatives:
We fully endorse the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

From late February to early March this year, we participated in the provincial on-site conference on ethnic work held in Jianhe County, Guizhou Province, giving us the opportunity to visit Jianhe County's production situation. We were deeply moved by what we saw in Jianhe County. Jianhe is a county in the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture. It is home to 170,000 hardworking and brave people of various ethnic groups, of which the Miao account for about 71% and the Dong about 14%. The entire county is located in the Miaoling mountain area, with 300,000 mu of cultivated land, 90% of which is terraced hillside soil, making cultivation difficult and yields very low. In the past, local people described this place as a "goat path, wild boar's den," and "water cannot be led to the fields, and manure cannot be carried up the slopes." After liberation, under the leadership and support of the Party and the People's Government, through the arduous struggle of the people of all ethnic groups, the original poverty and backwardness have undergone significant changes. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, relying on the People's Communes, displaying soaring enthusiasm, and resolutely implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, overcoming various difficulties, the county's total grain output reached more than 410 million jin in 1959, with an average yield of more than 1,300 jin per mu, making it a "thousand-jin-per-mu county." While achieving a bumper harvest in grain production, the county also launched a massive "small autumn harvest" movement, with people of all ethnic groups vying to "go up the mountains to collect treasures," collecting and utilizing large quantities of mountain materials and goods. The average income per person in the county reached more than 220 yuan. To process the large amount of mountain materials and goods, starch, wine, rubber, and soda ash processing industries were vigorously developed, leading to the rapid development of county and commune industries. The tremendous achievements made by Jianhe County in industrial and agricultural production in 1959 greatly encouraged the fighting will of the people of all ethnic groups, and their material, cultural lives, and mental outlook have undergone great changes. The average income per person has increased eight times compared to the early days of liberation, and the cultural life of the masses has improved unprecedentedly. This change in Jianhe County is a victory for the people of all ethnic groups in the county under the leadership of the Party, resolutely implementing the Party's General Line, adhering to the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes.

In the Great Leap Forward of 1959, the revolutionary drive of the people of all ethnic groups in Jianhe County, and their heroic spirit of fighting difficulties, were very moving. In order to win a bumper harvest in agriculture, the people of the whole county implemented a general mobilization, deep-plowing 240,000 mu of fields, using the method of fire-ÁÜè fertilizer to improve 90,000 mu of acidic soil, and applying an average of about 40,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of all cultivated land. At the same time, they built water conservancy projects, developed indigenous pesticides, and carried out technical innovation and technical revolution. To solve the fertilizer problem, tens of thousands of laborers from the whole county set up camps on the mountains, eating and sleeping in the fields, and widely used leaves and weeds to accumulate and create natural fertilizers. In the "small autumn harvest" movement, 80,000 people in the county went to the mountains every day. They split up and searched every mountain, collecting during the day and transporting at night, collecting a large amount of sawtooth oak, wild fiber, wild oilseeds, and other mountain goods and medicinal materials, achieving great victories. In the transportation of mountain goods, they made full use of the natural conditions of the mountainous areas, using cableways in high mountains and chutes on steep slopes; with many cattle and horses, they vigorously engaged in cattle and horse transport and cattle and horse-drawn carts. The county organized more than 1,100 cattle and horse-drawn carts and 22,000 cattle and horses for transportation, launching a mass short-distance transportation upsurge. The broad masses started with their own hands, adopting the method of using local materials, relying on self-reliance and indigenous processing as the mainstay, and vigorously engaged in mountain goods processing. In order to overcome the difficulty of not understanding technology, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee personally ran a factory to conduct experiments, overcome technical barriers, and held on-site conferences at all levels, learning and operating at the same time, so that processing technology was quickly popularized to the masses. Many starch factories, rubber factories, and soda ash factories were set up throughout the county. The great victory achieved by Jianhe County in industrial and agricultural production is a victory for the people of all ethnic groups in the county, under the leadership of the Party, displaying soaring enthusiasm and marching towards nature. They made full use of the favorable conditions of the mountainous areas, fought tenaciously, and developed the mountainous areas, turning "poor mountains into rich mountains," greatly changing the face of the mountainous areas.

The cadres at all levels in Jianhe County have done a good job in theoretical study. There is a surge of cadres studying Chairman Mao's works, and they have adhered to a regular study system. The First Secretary of the County Party Committee took the lead in adhering to theoretical study, day after day, for five years. Under the leadership and influence of the County Party Committee, cadres at all levels have adhered to two hours of study every day. Party member leading cadres bring Chairman Mao's works and Party lesson materials with them when they go down to work; they study while working, giving lessons to the cadres and explaining Chairman Mao's works to the masses wherever they go. A new atmosphere of "everyone learning theory, everyone's thoughts flying red flags" has emerged in the county. Leading cadres at all levels go deep into the masses in their work, consult with the masses on everything, listen to the opinions and criticisms of the masses, and fully believe in and rely on the masses. The relationship between cadres and the masses is very close. They integrate with the masses in life, eating, living, and laboring with the masses. In 1959, the cadres directly participated in labor. County-level cadres participated in labor for an average of thirteen days per month, commune cadres for fourteen days, and management area cadres for seventeen days. They went deep into the reality of production, participated in production, and led production, adopting the methods of vigorously launching mass movements, vigorously carrying out appraisals and competitions, and vigorously engaging in experimental fields to guide production. Last year, leading cadres at all levels planted more than 4,800 mu of rice experimental fields, mastered production technology, and summarized and promoted experience in a timely manner. Last year, the county held more than 580 on-site conferences, launching a surge of learning from advanced, competing with advanced, catching up with advanced, and helping backward, which effectively promoted the development of production. According to the characteristics of the mountainous areas, Party committees at all levels seized the early sowing, early transplanting, and early management, and rice sowing was advanced by more than 30 days compared with previous years. Before "Mangzhong" (Grain in Ear), transplanting was completed. Before the autumn winds and autumn rains came, the rice here was already golden, achieving a bumper harvest. The masses deeply understand that this is the result of mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people under the leadership of the Party. They said meaningfully: "In the past, we believed in 'ghost teachers' when working, and suffered a lot; now, we listen to the Party branch secretary in production, and we have bumper harvests year after year."

The situation in Jianhe County has made us further realize the unparalleled superiority of the People's Communes. The People's Communes have enabled the rapid development of production and construction, have significantly improved people's lives, and have further strengthened the unity among all ethnic groups. The People's Communes unite the people of all ethnic groups, making them more closely linked economically. The diverse collective welfare undertakings developed by the communes have brought the people of all ethnic groups into closer contact in their lives, thus greatly enhancing mutual friendship. In particular, the public canteens of the People's Communes are getting better and better and have become warm homes for the people of all ethnic groups. We have seen that in the People's Communes of Jianhe County, people of all ethnic groups work and live together, helping each other, supporting each other, and cooperating with each other. Liuchuan Commune's Chengguan Management Area has little labor and few cattle. Last year, they were too busy during transplanting and were about to transplant old seedlings. Jiuyang Management Area (Miao) learned about it and immediately dispatched more than 200 people and more than 100 cattle to support them, enabling them to complete transplanting more than 20 days earlier than in previous years. Many communes have similar moving stories. The people of all ethnic groups in Jianhe County sing: "The People's Commune is a flower, all ethnic groups are one family, unite and help each other in production, and build a new country with one heart."

Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, our minority ethnic regions in Guizhou, like the Han regions, have seen continuous development in agricultural production, the continuous emergence of large and small factories, a thriving development of various production and construction undertakings, and a prosperous life for the people. We are very excited. We must unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, hold high the great banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, strive to study Chairman Mao's works, strive to do our work well, and strive to guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of China's 1960 national economic plan.
