Chairman, fellow representatives:
We fully endorse the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

From late February to early March this year, we participated in the provincial on-site conference on ethnic work held in Jianhe County, Guizhou Province, giving us the opportunity to visit Jianhe County's production situation. We were deeply moved by what we saw in Jianhe County. Jianhe is a county in the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture. It is home to 170,000 hardworking and brave people of various ethnic groups, of which the Miao account for about 71% and the Dong about 14%. The entire county is located in the Miaoling mountain area, with 300,000 mu of cultivated land, 90% of which is terraced hillside soil, making cultivation difficult and yields very low. In the past, local people described this place as a "goat path, wild boar's den," and "water cannot be led to the fields, and manure cannot be carried up the slopes." After liberation, under the leadership and support of the Party and the People's Government, through the arduous struggle of the people of all ethnic groups, the original poverty and backwardness have undergone significant changes. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, relying on the People's Communes, displaying soaring enthusiasm, and resolutely implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, overcoming various difficulties, the county's total grain output reached more than 410 million jin in 1959, with an average yield of more than 1,300 jin per mu, making it a "thousand-jin-per-mu county." While achieving a bumper harvest in grain production, the county also launched a massive "small autumn harvest" movement, with people of all ethnic groups vying to "go up the mountains to collect treasures," collecting and utilizing large quantities of mountain materials and goods. The average income per person in the county reached more than 220 yuan. To process the large amount of mountain materials and goods, starch, wine, rubber, and soda ash processing industries were vigorously developed, leading to the rapid development of county and commune industries. The tremendous achievements made by Jianhe County in industrial and agricultural production in 1959 greatly encouraged the fighting will of the people of all ethnic groups, and their material, cultural lives, and mental outlook have undergone great changes. The average income per person has increased eight times compared to the early days of liberation, and the cultural life of the masses has improved unprecedentedly. This change in Jianhe County is a victory for the people of all ethnic groups in the county under the leadership of the Party, resolutely implementing the Party's General Line, adhering to the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes.

In the Great Leap Forward of 1959, the revolutionary drive of the people of all ethnic groups in Jianhe County, and their heroic spirit of fighting difficulties, were very moving. In order to win a bumper harvest in agriculture, the people of the whole county implemented a general mobilization, deep-plowing 240,000 mu of fields, using the method of fire-熏 fertilizer to improve 90,000 mu of acidic soil, and applying an average of about 40,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of all cultivated land. At the same time, they built water conservancy projects, developed indigenous pesticides, and carried out technical innovation and technical revolution. To solve the fertilizer problem, tens of thousands of laborers from the whole county set up camps on the mountains, eating and sleeping in the fields, and widely used leaves and weeds to accumulate and create natural fertilizers. In the "small autumn harvest" movement, 80,000 people in the county went to the mountains every day. They split up and searched every mountain, collecting during the day and transporting at night, collecting a large amount of sawtooth oak, wild fiber, wild oilseeds, and other mountain goods and medicinal materials, achieving great victories. In the transportation of mountain goods, they made full use of the natural conditions of the mountainous areas, using cableways in high mountains and chutes on steep slopes; with many cattle and horses, they vigorously engaged in cattle and horse transport and cattle and horse-drawn carts. The county organized more than 1,100 cattle and horse-drawn carts and 22,000 cattle and horses for transportation, launching a mass short-distance transportation upsurge. The broad masses started with their own hands, adopting the method of using local materials, relying on self-reliance and indigenous processing as the mainstay, and vigorously engaged in mountain goods processing. In order to overcome the difficulty of not understanding technology, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee personally ran a factory to conduct experiments, overcome technical barriers, and held on-site conferences at all levels, learning and operating at the same time, so that processing technology was quickly popularized to the masses. Many starch factories, rubber factories, and soda ash factories were set up throughout the county. The great victory achieved by Jianhe County in industrial and agricultural production is a victory for the people of all ethnic groups in the county, under the leadership of the Party, displaying soaring enthusiasm and marching towards nature. They made full use of the favorable conditions of the mountainous areas, fought tenaciously, and developed the mountainous areas, turning "poor mountains into rich mountains," greatly changing the face of the mountainous areas.

The cadres at all levels in Jianhe County have done a good job in theoretical study. There is a surge of cadres studying Chairman Mao's works, and they have adhered to a regular study system. The First Secretary of the County Party Committee took the lead in adhering to theoretical study, day after day, for five years. Under the leadership and influence of the County Party Committee, cadres at all levels have adhered to two hours of study every day. Party member leading cadres bring Chairman Mao's works and Party lesson materials with them when they go down to work; they study while working, giving lessons to the cadres and explaining Chairman Mao's works to the masses wherever they go. A new atmosphere of "everyone learning theory, everyone's thoughts flying red flags" has emerged in the county. Leading cadres at all levels go deep into the masses in their work, consult with the masses on everything, listen to the opinions and criticisms of the masses, and fully believe in and rely on the masses. The relationship between cadres and the masses is very close. They integrate with the masses in life, eating, living, and laboring with the masses. In 1959, the cadres directly participated in labor. County-level cadres participated in labor for an average of thirteen days per month, commune cadres for fourteen days, and management area cadres for seventeen days. They went deep into the reality of production, participated in production, and led production, adopting the methods of vigorously launching mass movements, vigorously carrying out appraisals and competitions, and vigorously engaging in experimental fields to guide production. Last year, leading cadres at all levels planted more than 4,800 mu of rice experimental fields, mastered production technology, and summarized and promoted experience in a timely manner. Last year, the county held more than 580 on-site conferences, launching a surge of learning from advanced, competing with advanced, catching up with advanced, and helping backward, which effectively promoted the development of production. According to the characteristics of the mountainous areas, Party committees at all levels seized the early sowing, early transplanting, and early management, and rice sowing was advanced by more than 30 days compared with previous years. Before "Mangzhong" (Grain in Ear), transplanting was completed. Before the autumn winds and autumn rains came, the rice here was already golden, achieving a bumper harvest. The masses deeply understand that this is the result of mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people under the leadership of the Party. They said meaningfully: "In the past, we believed in 'ghost teachers' when working, and suffered a lot; now, we listen to the Party branch secretary in production, and we have bumper harvests year after year."

The situation in Jianhe County has made us further realize the unparalleled superiority of the People's Communes. The People's Communes have enabled the rapid development of production and construction, have significantly improved people's lives, and have further strengthened the unity among all ethnic groups. The People's Communes unite the people of all ethnic groups, making them more closely linked economically. The diverse collective welfare undertakings developed by the communes have brought the people of all ethnic groups into closer contact in their lives, thus greatly enhancing mutual friendship. In particular, the public canteens of the People's Communes are getting better and better and have become warm homes for the people of all ethnic groups. We have seen that in the People's Communes of Jianhe County, people of all ethnic groups work and live together, helping each other, supporting each other, and cooperating with each other. Liuchuan Commune's Chengguan Management Area has little labor and few cattle. Last year, they were too busy during transplanting and were about to transplant old seedlings. Jiuyang Management Area (Miao) learned about it and immediately dispatched more than 200 people and more than 100 cattle to support them, enabling them to complete transplanting more than 20 days earlier than in previous years. Many communes have similar moving stories. The people of all ethnic groups in Jianhe County sing: "The People's Commune is a flower, all ethnic groups are one family, unite and help each other in production, and build a new country with one heart."

Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, our minority ethnic regions in Guizhou, like the Han regions, have seen continuous development in agricultural production, the continuous emergence of large and small factories, a thriving development of various production and construction undertakings, and a prosperous life for the people. We are very excited. We must unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, hold high the great banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, strive to study Chairman Mao's works, strive to do our work well, and strive to guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of China's 1960 national economic plan.

    变穷山为富山
    杨汉先、吴通明、王耀伦、李仿尧代表的联合发言主席、各位代表：
    我们完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告和人大常委会的工作报告。
    今年的2月底到3月初，我们参加了在贵州省剑河县召开的全省民族工作现场会议，有机会实地参观了剑河县的生产情况。我们在剑河县所看到的情况，使我们十分感动。剑河是黔东南苗族侗族自治州的一个县。这里居住着十七万勤劳勇敢的各族人民，其中苗族约占71％，侗族约占14％。全县处于苗岭山区，有耕地三十万亩，90％是梯田坡土，耕种困难，产量很低，过去当地人民说这个地方是“山羊路，野猪窝”，“有水引不到田，有粪送不上坡”。解放后，在党和人民政府的领导和扶持下，经过各族人民的艰巨的斗争，使原来的贫困、落后面貌有了显著的变化。特别是大跃进以来，全县人民在党的领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，依靠人民公社，发挥了冲天的干劲，坚决贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”，战胜了种种困难，在1959年使全县粮食总产量达到四亿一千多万斤，平均亩产量达到一千三百多斤，成为亩产千斤县。在粮食生产大丰收的同时，全县又掀起了一个声势浩大的“小秋收”运动，各族人民纷纷“上山取宝”，大量采集和利用山材山货，全县平均每人可收入二百二十多元。为了对大量的山材山货进行加工，大办淀粉、酿酒、烤胶、土碱等等加工工业，使县、社工业获得了迅速的发展。1959年剑河县在工农业生产上所取得的巨大成就，大大地鼓舞了各族人民的斗争意志，使他们的物质、文化生活和精神面貌，发生了很大的变化，每人平均收入较初解放时增长八倍，群众的文化生活水平空前提高。剑河县的这个变化，是全县各族人民在党的领导下，坚决贯彻执行了党的总路线、坚持了大跃进和人民公社的胜利。
    在1959年的大跃进中，剑河县各族人民的革命干劲，和他们同困难搏斗的英雄气概，是很动人的。为了夺取农业大丰收，全县人民实行了总动员，深翻田土二十四万亩，使用火熏肥的办法改良酸性土壤九万亩，全部耕地平均每亩积肥四万斤左右；同时，大修水利，大搞土农药，大搞技术革新和技术革命。为了解决肥料问题，全县数万劳动大军上山扎营，食宿田野，广泛利用了树叶、杂草，大积大造自然肥料。在“小秋收”运动中，全县每天有八万人上山，他们分路出击，挨山搜索，白天采，晚上运，采集了大量的青杠子、野生纤维、野生油料和其他山货、药材等，取得了很大的胜利。在山货的运输上，他们充分利用了山区的自然条件，高山搞索道，陡坡搞滑道；牛多马多就大搞牛驮马驮和牛、马拉车，全县共组织了牛马车一千一百多部，驮运牛马二万二千多头，掀起了群众性的短途运输的高潮。广大群众人人动手，采取就地取材、以自力更生和土法加工为主的办法，大搞山货加工；为了克服不懂技术的困难，县委第一书记亲自办厂进行试验，闯过了技术关，并且层层召开现场会议，边开会边学习操作，使加工技术很快的普及到群众，全县办起了很多淀粉厂、烤胶厂、土碱厂，等等。剑河县在工农业生产上所取得的巨大胜利，是全县各族人民在党的领导下，鼓足冲天的干劲，向大自然进军的胜利。他们充分利用了山区的有利条件，顽强斗争，开发山区，使“穷山变富山”，大大改变了山区的面貌。
    剑河县的各级干部，理论学习搞得很好。干部学习毛主席的著作形成了热潮，并且坚持了经常的学习制度。县委第一书记带头坚持理论学习，五年如一日。在县委的领导和影响下，各级干部都坚持了每天两小时的学习。党员领导干部下去工作，都带着毛主席的著作和党课教材；他们一面工作，一面学习，走到那里就给那里的干部上课，走到那里就给那里的群众讲解毛主席的著作，全县出现了“人人学理论，个个思想插红旗”的新气象。各级领导干部在工作中深入群众，遇事同群众商量，听取群众的意见和批评，充分地相信群众和依靠群众。干部同群众的关系十分密切。他们在生活上同群众打成一片，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动。在1959年一年内，干部都直接参加了劳动，县级机关干部平均每人每月参加劳动十三天，公社干部十四天，管理区的干部十七天。他们深入生产实际，参加生产，领导生产，采取大搞群众运动，大搞评比竞赛，大搞试验田的办法，来指导生产。去年各级领导干部种的水稻试验田就有四千八百多亩，掌握生产技术，及时总结、推广经验。去年全县召开了五百八十多次现场会议，掀起学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进的热潮，有力地促进了生产的发展。根据山区特点，各级党委抓住了早播、早栽、早管，水稻播种比往年提早了三十多天，“芒种”未到就完成了插秧，在秋风秋雨未来之前，这里的稻谷已经是一片金黄，取得了大丰收。群众深深地了解，这是由于在党的领导下把人民的积极性调动起来的结果，他们意味深长地说：“过去干活信‘鬼师’，受害不浅；如今生产听支书，丰收连年”。
    剑河县的情况，使我们进一步认识到人民公社的无比优越性。人民公社使生产建设事业得到了迅速的发展，使人民生活获得了显著的改善，也使各民族之间进一步增强了团结。人民公社把各族人民团结在一起，使他们在经济上更加紧密地结合起来。公社所发展起来的多种集体福利事业，使各族人民在生活上的接触更为密切，因而大大地增强了相互之间的友谊。特别是人民公社的公共食堂，越办越好，已经成为各族人民温暖的家庭。我们看到，在剑河县的人民公社里，各族人民共同劳动，共同生活，你帮我，我帮你，互相支援，互相协作。柳川公社城关管理区劳力少，耕牛也少，去年插秧时忙不过来，眼看就要栽老秧，久仰管理区（苗族）知道了，立刻抽调二百多人、一百多头耕牛去支援，使他们比往年还提早二十多天完成了插秧。许多公社都有类似的动人事例。剑河县的各族人民歌颂：“人民公社一朵花，各族人民共一家，团结互助搞生产，同心建设新国家”。
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们贵州少数民族地区和汉族地区一样，农业生产不断发展，大大小小的工厂不断出现，各项生产建设事业蒸蒸日上，人民生活欣欣向荣，我们感到非常兴奋。我们一定要更加紧密地团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的伟大旗帜，努力学习毛主席著作，努力作好工作，为保证完成和超额完成我国1960年的国民经济计划而奋斗。
