Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th: Seoul dispatch: A large-scale demonstration broke out in Seoul on the 6th, protesting the fascist rule of the U.S.-Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea and the bloody "presidential" election staged by Syngman Rhee on March 15th.

According to reports, about five thousand people, including workers, students, youth, unemployed people, and men and women from other strata of society, participated in the demonstration. They held banners and shouted slogans: "Syngman Rhee government, resign!" and marched towards the Syngman Rhee clique's "National Assembly," the U.S. "Embassy," and Syngman Rhee's residence.

Syngman Rhee, as if facing a formidable enemy, declared "emergency martial law" and dispatched a large number of armed police and mounted police, setting up "security lines." However, the demonstrators broke through the "security lines" with their bodies, and the number of participants in the demonstration increased.

Syngman Rhee's police blocked the marching crowd with police cars near the "National Assembly" and also beat the demonstrators with whips. To prevent the demonstrators from going to Syngman Rhee's residence, the police attacked the demonstrators four or five times. The marching crowd later went to the Seoul "Police Bureau" and then to the Syngman Rhee clique's "Ministry of Home Affairs," firmly demanding the release of the arrested demonstrators and protesting Syngman Rhee's fascist rule.

This large-scale demonstration lasted for three and a half hours. Seventy people were arrested, and many were injured by the police. Twenty policemen of the Syngman Rhee clique were injured while brutally suppressing the masses.

In addition, according to the South Korean News Agency, soldiers of the Syngman Rhee clique's puppet navy stationed in Chinhae staged a "collective departure from the camp" demonstration on the 4th. After failing to cover up the news, the commander of the Syngman Rhee clique's navy had to admit that the soldier demonstration had occurred.

Not long ago, a part of the 33rd division of the Syngman Rhee puppet army had collectively deserted.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th: This reporter reports: In the past month, demonstrations and parades by people in various parts of South Korea have risen one after another, with great momentum. On the afternoon of March 15th, the day the Syngman Rhee clique forcibly "elected," a demonstration of thousands of people broke out in Masan. After that, demonstrations and parades took place one after another in Daegu, Daejeon, Seoul, Busan, and other places, opposing the Syngman Rhee clique's monopoly of the "election" and the suppression of the people of Masan.

Under the vigorous situation of the broad masses of people opposing the U.S.-Syngman Rhee clique, South Korean opposition parties have also launched struggles against the Syngman Rhee clique based on their own interests.

The South Korean Lawyers Association, which had sent eight lawyers to Masan to investigate the Syngman Rhee clique's bloody actions, issued a statement on March 29, emphasizing that the persons in charge and police who suppressed the Masan demonstrators must be arrested and treated as murderers. The South Korean Newspaper Editors Association also issued a statement condemning the police for "slaughtering" demonstrators and protesting the police's beating of journalists who went to Masan to report.

The surging tide of the people's struggle has prompted the deepening and intensification of internal contradictions within the Syngman Rhee clique. They compete for power and profit, attack each other, and look for "scapegoats" to shirk responsibility for the "presidential election" farce and the "Masan incident" in order to confuse the South Korean people. According to reports, Choi In-kyu, the puppet "Minister of Home Affairs" of the Syngman Rhee clique, resigned on March 18.

The Syngman Rhee clique's situation of complete political bankruptcy has caused unease within Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party. According to the South Korean Contract News Agency, some Liberal Party "members of the National Assembly" admitted that the Liberal Party "excessively used official power to interfere" in the "election," and although it achieved "victory," it "lost the hearts of the people" and "suffered a fatal blow in political activities." Some Liberal Party members believe that "public sentiment has deteriorated extremely" and that "even the next National Assembly election will be ruined."

### 反对美李集团在南朝鲜的法西斯统治  汉城人民举行大规模示威

    反对美李集团在南朝鲜的法西斯统治
    汉城人民举行大规模示威
    新华社平壤7日电　汉城消息：汉城市6日爆发了大规模的示威游行，抗议美国—李承晚集团在南朝鲜的法西斯统治和李承晚在3月15日导演的血腥的“总统”选举。
    据报道，参加示威的有工人、学生、青年、失业者和其他阶层的男女市民共约五千多人。他们举着旗帜，高呼口号：“李承晚政府，辞职！”向李承晚集团的“国会大厦”、美国“大使馆”和李承晚的住所前进。
    李承晚如临大敌，宣布“紧急戒严”，并且出动了大批的武装警察和骑警，布设了“警备线”。但是示威的人群用自己的身体冲破“警备线”，参加示威的人数越来越多。
    李承晚的警察在“国会大厦”附近用警车阻挡游行队伍，还用马鞭殴打示威群众。为阻止示威者前往李承晚的住所，警察曾有四、五次向示威者进攻。游行队伍后来开到汉城“警察局”并前往李承晚集团的“内务省”，坚决要求释放被捕示威者，抗议李承晚的法西斯统治。
    这次大规模的示威持续了三个半小时。有七十个人遭到逮捕，很多人被警察打伤。李承晚集团有二十个警察在野蛮镇压群众时受伤。
    另外，据南朝鲜通讯社透露，驻在镇海的李承晚集团伪海军士兵在4日发生“集体离开营地”示威的行动。李承晚集团海军司令在无法掩盖这一消息之后，不得不承认发生过这起士兵示威事件。
    不久前，李伪军三十三师的一部分士兵曾经集体逃跑。
    据新华社平壤7日电　本社记者报道：近一个月来，南朝鲜各地人民示威游行此伏彼起，声势浩大。就在3月15日李承晚集团强行“选举”的那天下午，马山市爆发了有数千人参加的示威游行。在这以后，大丘、大田、汉城、釜山等地接连发生示威游行，反对李承晚集团包揽“选举”和对马山人民的镇压。
    在广大人民反对美国—李承晚集团的斗争蓬蓬勃勃的形势下，南朝鲜在野党派也从本身利益出发对李承晚集团展开斗争。
    曾经派八名律师到马山调查李承晚集团血腥行为的南朝鲜律师协会在3月29日发表声明，强调必须把镇压马山示威人民的负责人和警察全部逮捕，当杀人犯处理。南朝鲜报纸编辑协会也发表声明，谴责警察“屠杀”示威者，并抗议警察殴打去马山采访的新闻记者。
    人民群众斗争的汹涌浪潮促使着李承晚集团内部矛盾加深加剧。他们争权夺利，互相攻讦，并为推卸“总统选举”丑剧和“马山事件”的责任寻找“替死鬼”，来迷惑南朝鲜人民。据报道，李承晚集团的伪“内务部”长官崔仁圭已在3月18日辞职。
    李承晚集团在政治上彻底破产的处境已经在李承晚的自由党内部引起不安。据南朝鲜的合同通讯社透露，一些自由党“国会议员”承认，自由党在“选举”中“过分地使用官方权力进行干涉”，虽然取得了“胜利”，但“失去了民心”，“在政治活动上遭到致命的打击”。有的自由党议员认为“民心极度恶化”，“连下一次国会选举也糟了”。
