Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 13th: Today, 1,448 Indonesian returned overseas Chinese arrived at Zhanjiang Port aboard the "Russia" ship. They were warmly welcomed by more than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Zhanjiang at the Zhanjiang Port Wharf.

　　At a little after 2:00 PM, the "Russia" slowly docked. The returned overseas Chinese sang the national anthem on the ship. Two red banners were hung on both sides of the front of the ship, which read: "Motherland! Dear Mother, your overseas children have finally returned. We are determined to contribute all our strength to the socialist construction of the motherland." The returned overseas Chinese crowded on the deck and shouted: "Long live the Motherland!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sang songs such as "Socialism is Good" and "Ode to the Motherland" in unison with the welcoming masses. As soon as the ship docked, the wharf, decorated with colorful flags, was filled with the sounds of gongs, drums, and firecrackers, warmly welcoming the overseas Chinese who had been persecuted in Indonesia back to the embrace of the motherland. Many poor workers who had sold their labor in Indonesia for more than 20 or 30 years were moved to tears by the warm welcome and care of the motherland.

　　At a little after 5:00 PM, the returned overseas Chinese took special buses to the Overseas Chinese Reception Center to rest. During their stay in Zhanjiang City, they will visit various construction projects in the Zhanjiang Special Zone.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 13th: More than 600 overseas Chinese who were affected by a fire in Bangka, Indonesia, returned to Shantou this morning aboard China's third batch of repatriation ship "Da Bao Kang." They were warmly welcomed and cordially comforted by the leaders of the Shantou Special Zone Party and government and more than 500 people from all walks of life in Shantou.

　　This is the second group of distressed overseas Chinese who have returned to the motherland after suffering a fire in Bangka. They received meticulous care and attention from the repatriation staff on board. Many returned overseas Chinese wrote big-character posters thanking the motherland for its care for overseas Chinese and expressing their willingness to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.
