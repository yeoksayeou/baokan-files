Xinhua News Agency, 2nd – People's communes in both new and old cotton-growing regions across the country, spurred by the large-scale cotton high-yield demonstration plot movement, started their cotton planting preparations earlier this year, with faster progress and better quality. At present, sowing preparations have been basically completed. In the southern provinces and regions with earlier seasons such as Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, cotton sowing is entering its busiest stage. In the north, some areas of Anhui, Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces have also begun sowing. Cotton sowing will soon enter a high tide throughout the country.

Undertaking large-scale cotton high-yield demonstration plots and launching a high-yield movement on large cotton areas is the key to increasing cotton production this year. In the past two years, cotton-producing areas have designated a portion of land to establish high-yield plots, carry out high-yield movements on large areas, and use this to drive increased production in ordinary fields. Practice has proven that vigorously developing cotton high-yield demonstration plots is an effective way to develop cotton production at a high speed. The yield per mu in high-yield cotton fields is 20%, 30%, or even more than 50% higher than the yield in ordinary cotton fields. Driven by the high-yield plots, the yield of ordinary cotton fields also improves relatively quickly. Moreover, high-yield plots create favorable conditions for fully implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and realizing agricultural modernization. Therefore, as early as last October, at the National Cotton Leap Forward On-site Conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture, representatives from various regions proposed that in 1960, 40% of the national cotton field area should be cultivated as high-yield cotton fields with high targets, and the yield per mu should be 50% higher than the local average yield per mu. This call received a warm response from the vast cadres and commune members of people's communes in cotton-producing areas across the country. In the Guanzhong area of ​​Shaanxi, the seven major cotton-producing counties and cities of Sanyuan, Dali, Weinan, Pucheng, Hancheng, Zhouzhi, and Tongchuan, as well as some key cotton-producing communes and production teams, successively held cotton high-yield professional meetings, on-site meetings, and leap forward meetings last winter to make specific arrangements for cotton field high-yield plots, establish specialized teams for planting high-yield plots, and fix the land. Up to now, the high-yield plot cotton fields planned by various regions account for more than 40% of the national cotton planting area. The area of ​​cotton high-yield plots in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces accounts for more than 45% of the total cotton planting area in these provinces. Most of these high-yield cotton fields have been assigned to production units and land plots. The cotton fields in the high-yield plots are generally large areas connected together. There were not many high-yield plots of more than 10,000 mu last year, but many high-yield plots of 30,000 mu, 40,000 mu, and 50,000 mu have been established in various places this year. Moreover, they are all demarcated from land with better soil quality and better water conservancy conditions. In order to ensure the realization of high-yield plans for high-yield plots, Handan Prefecture in Hebei Province has built more than 2,000 pig farms in more than 2,400 high-yield plots, raising more than 263,000 pigs; established more than 1,000 local fertilizer plants, and more than 500 factories for agricultural tool repair and feed processing, so that high-yield plots can achieve local fertilizer accumulation and application, and local repair of damaged farm tools. The area of cotton high-yield plots arranged by Shandong Province accounts for nearly half of the province's cotton field area. These high-yield plots have all opened up irrigation channels, which can ensure a good harvest regardless of drought or flood. In order to grow high-yield cotton plots well, Party organizations at all levels in Shandong Province have generally adopted the method of "four unifications" (leadership, organization, command, management) and "five to the fields" (leaders, technology, specialized teams, measures, yield) to strengthen the leadership of high-yield plots. In the movement to vigorously develop high-yield plots, various places have appropriately concentrated the cotton fields that were scattered in the past, and planted them in continuous plots to facilitate the innovation of cotton planting technology and improve yield. In Haining County, Zhejiang Province, 74,000 mu of cotton fields were scattered across 14 communes last year; this year, they have been planned and adjusted, and concentrated in four communes for planting.

The cotton planting preparation movement, centered on vigorously developing high-yield plots, has been carried out vigorously since last winter, which has made the cotton sowing preparation work faster and of better quality this year. Cotton fields that should have been deep-plowed in winter have been deep-plowed. In the nine provinces and cities of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Beijing, the cotton fields deep-plowed in winter account for 90% to 100% of the cotton field area in these provinces and cities, generally deep-plowed seven inches to one foot. In the past, there was no habit of winter deep-plowing in double-cropping cotton fields in the south. This year, deep digging and freezing was carried out between the rows of winter crops. In Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Sichuan, and other provinces, the cotton fields with deep digging and freezing account for more than half of the double-cropping cotton fields. Jinan Prefecture in Shanxi Province has vigorously carried out farmland capital construction centered on high-yield plots (ridges and ditches), which has transformed the original 200,000 cotton fields (15 mu each) into more than 2,500 high-yield plots of thousands and tens of thousands of mu, and achieved a level ground like a mirror, straight ridges like lines, and tidy roads. Combined with deep plowing, 80% of the cotton fields nationwide have been fertilized as base fertilizer. The fertilizer for the remaining cotton fields has also been prepared or transported to the fields. Generally, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu is 6,000 to 8,000 jin, and more than 10,000 jin in high-yield fields, and the quality of the fertilizer has been greatly improved compared to previous years. More than 60% of cotton fields across the country have been irrigated, an expansion of approximately 25% compared to last year. In the five provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, which are the main cotton-producing areas in the Yellow River Basin, more than 70% of the cotton fields can be worry-free from drought and flood. Since last winter, the rainfall in the cotton areas of the above five provinces has been less than normal, but at present, the cotton fields that have been irrigated in winter and spring in these five provinces account for approximately 70% of the irrigable cotton fields, greatly reducing the threat of drought and creating favorable conditions for timely early sowing of cotton. Various places have also prepared sufficient fine varieties for cotton sowing and supplemented and repaired sowing tools. Cotton seeds have been distributed to each production team, and many seeds have undergone particle selection treatment. Shaanxi Province has produced 27,000 double-row strip seeders and more than 500 four-row strip seeders. Including the existing ones, there is an average of one seeder for less than 100 mu of cotton fields.

Various places have also vigorously developed cotton nutrient pot seedling cultivation and grid seedling cultivation this year. Comparative experiments in Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, over the past few years have shown that cotton grown by seedling transplanting has the advantages of early development, compact plants, large bolls, sufficient lint percentage, high yield, early maturity, and increased production, with a yield increase of more than 30% compared to direct-sown cotton. This year, Cixi County plans to adopt seedling transplanting for 70% of its cotton fields. In the past, the area of ​​seedling transplanting in Hunan Province was very small, but this year it plans to expand to 80% of the planned cotton planting area. In order to do a good job in seedling transplanting, various places have trained a large number of technicians and assigned them to various places for guidance.

    棉花丰产方运动遍及南北棉区
    丰产方占全国棉花播种面积百分之四十
    备耕工作基本就绪由南到北齐忙播种
    新华社2日讯　全国新老棉区的人民公社，在大搞棉花丰产方运动的推动下，今年棉花备耕工作动手早，进度快，质量好。目前，播种准备工作已经基本就绪。季节较早的南方云南、四川、广西、广东和江西等省区棉花播种工作已进入大忙阶段，北方的安徽、河南、河北、山西等省部分地区也已开始播种，全国棉花播种工作即将进入高潮。
    大搞棉花丰产方，开展棉花大面积高产运动，是今年棉花增产的关键。过去两年，各产棉区都划出一部分土地建立丰产方，开展大面积高产运动，并以此来带动一般田增产。实践证明：大搞棉花丰产方是高速度发展棉花生产的有效办法。丰产方棉田的亩产量，比一般棉田的产量都高20％、30％，以至50％以上；一般棉田在丰产方的带动下，产量也有较快的提高；而且丰产方为全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”，为实现农业现代化创造了良好的条件。因此，早在去年10月农业部召开的全国棉花跃进现场会议上，各地代表就提出要在1960年全国棉田面积中，培养40％的高额丰产棉田，亩产量要比当地平均亩产量高50％。这一号召得到全国各产棉区人民公社广大干部和社员群众的热烈响应。陕西关中地区的三原、大荔、渭南、蒲城、韩城、盩厔和铜川七个主要产棉县、市和部分重点产棉公社、生产队，在去冬就先后召开棉花丰产专业会、现场会和跃进会，对棉田丰产方作了具体安排，建立了丰产方植棉专业队，固定了地块。到目前为止，各地规划的丰产方棉田已占全国棉花播种面积的40％多。河北、山东、河南、陕西、江苏、湖北、湖南和江西等省棉花丰产方的面积，都占这些省棉花播种总面积的45％以上。这些丰产方棉田绝大部分已落实到包产单位和地块。丰产方的棉田，一般都是大面积的连成一片的，去年万亩以上的丰产方还不太多，今年三万亩、四万亩、五万亩的丰产方各地搞了不少。而且都是抽出土质较好和水利条件较好的土地划成的。河北邯郸专区为了保证丰产方实现丰产计划，已在二千四百多个丰产方里建起两千多个养猪场，养猪二十六万三千多头；建立土化肥厂一千多个，农具修配、饲料加工等工厂五百多个，使丰产方能做到就地积肥就地施肥，农具坏了就地修。山东省安排的棉花丰产方的面积占全省棉田面积近一半，这些丰产方都开辟了灌溉渠道，可以做到旱涝保丰收。为了种好棉花丰产方，山东省各级党组织普遍采取了四统一（领导、组织、指挥、管理）和五到田（领导、技术、专业队、措施、产量）的办法，加强丰产方的领导。在大搞丰产方运动中，各地把过去分散种植的棉田，实行适当集中，划方连片种植，便利进行革新植棉技术，提高产量。浙江省海宁县七万四千亩棉田，去年分散在十四个公社种植；今年有计划地调整，集中在四个公社种植。
    以大搞丰产方为中心的棉花备耕运动，从去冬以来一直开展得轰轰烈烈，这就使今年棉花播种准备工作进度快，质量好。应该冬耕的棉田都进行了冬耕，河北、山东、河南、安徽、江苏、山西、陕西、四川和北京等九个省、市，冬耕的棉田占这些省、市棉田面积的90％到100％，一般深耕七寸到一尺。南方两熟棉田过去无冬耕习惯，今年进行了冬作物行间深挖冻凌，湖北、江苏、浙江、湖南、四川等省深挖冻凌的棉田占两熟棉田的一半以上。山西省晋南专区大搞丰产方（梁、沟）为中心的农田基本建设，已使原来二十万块棉田（每块十五亩），连成了两千五百多个千亩、万亩丰产方，并达到了地平如镜，埂直如线，道路整齐。结合深耕，全国80％的棉田施了底肥。其余棉田的肥料也已准备好或运到了地头。一般每亩施肥量六千到八千斤，丰产田在万斤以上，而且肥料的质量比往年有很大的提高。全国棉田已实现水利化的占60％以上，比去年扩大了25％左右。我国黄河流域主要产棉区的河北、河南、山东、山西、陕西五省，70％以上的棉田可以做到旱涝无忧。从去冬以来，上述五省棉区降水量都少于常年，但目前这五省已进行冬春灌溉的棉田，约占可灌溉棉田的70％，大大减轻了干旱的威胁，为及时早播棉花创造了良好的条件。各地还为棉花播种准备了足够的良种，增补和检修了播种工具。棉种已经分配到各生产队，许多种子经过粒选处理。陕西省已生产双行条播机二万七千架，四行条播机五百多架，加上原有的，平均不到一百亩棉田，就有一架播种机。
    各地今年还大搞棉花营养钵育苗和方格育苗。浙江慈溪县几年来的对比试验，育苗移栽的棉花具有早发育、植株紧凑、桃大、衣分足、产量高、早熟增产的优点，产量比直播棉花增产三成以上。今年慈溪县计划70％的棉田采取育苗移栽；湖南省过去育苗移栽面积很小，今年计划扩大到占计划植棉面积的80％。为了搞好育苗移栽工作，各地已培养训练了大批技术人员，分派到各地进行辅导。
