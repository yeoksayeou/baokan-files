    Firmly Establish the Belief in Self-Reliance, Enhance the Industrial Base of Each County
    Jiangxi's Small Blast Furnace Transformation and Great Development
    More Than 70 Small Blast Furnaces Restored and Newly Built in Half a Month, More Than 30 Carried Out Technical Transformation
    (Our Newspaper, Nanchang, April 24th) Jiangxi Province is further implementing the policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale enterprises, vigorously restoring, transforming, and building a large number of small iron-smelting blast furnaces, and vigorously developing iron and steel "small native groups" and "small foreign groups," striving for a greater leap forward in iron and steel production. According to incomplete statistics in mid-April, the province restored and newly built more than 70 small blast furnaces in half a month and carried out technical transformation on more than 30 small blast furnaces.
    Adhering to putting politics in command, strengthening organizational leadership, and leaders going to the furnace side are important guarantees for Jiangxi to quickly set off a new upsurge in iron and steel production. When organizing this upsurge in iron and steel production, cadres in various places generally conducted a serious ideological review. In the review, using many vivid examples of high-yield and high-quality small blast furnaces, they criticized some people's erroneous understanding of underestimating small blast furnaces and further strengthened their belief in long-term implementation of the combination of large, medium, and small-scale enterprises and the combination of native and foreign methods. After unifying their thinking, each special district established and improved iron and steel leading groups, and each county established iron and steel production offices to specifically direct and inspect the restoration, transformation, construction, and production of small blast furnaces. At the same time, a system of daily reporting, three-day inspection, and seven-day evaluation was established to carry out inspection and supervision.
    Relying on the masses, self-reliance, and cooperation in all aspects are a prominent feature of Jiangxi's large-scale development of small-scale iron and steel plants and the construction of small blast furnaces. In order to solve the problem of insufficient funds, equipment, and materials for restoring and newly building small blast furnaces, the Shangrao Special District generally compressed a number of non-productive construction projects, freeing up funds to invest in small blast furnace construction. On the other hand, it fully mobilized various departments and the broad masses, adopting various methods such as finding, digging, substituting, cooperating, and borrowing to produce more than 300 tons of steel, cement, and other materials. Mechanical, construction, installation, and other relevant departments throughout the province have also listed support for the construction and transformation of small blast furnaces as an important task of their departments, doing everything possible to solve the difficult problems for the construction and production of blast furnaces.
    In order to enable the restored and newly built small blast furnaces to be put into production quickly, all parts of the province also seized the production, storage, and transportation of raw materials and fuels, and other series of production preparations. In early April, the Ji'an Special District transferred more than 3,000 "native experts" who had smelted iron in 1958 to the iron-smelting base to participate in furnace-front operations. The staff and workers of Henglu Iron and Steel Plant in Leping County prepared materials while constructing infrastructure. By the beginning of April, they had prepared enough ore for half a year for the small blast furnace under construction.
    While vigorously building "small native groups" and "small foreign groups" of iron and steel enterprises, all parts of the country have also strengthened the leadership of existing iron and steel enterprises, carried out technical transformation on all blast furnaces, and extensively carried out the technical revolution movement. The average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces has generally been greatly improved.
    Due to the putting into production of a large number of small blast furnaces and the further improvement of production capacity after the technical transformation of various iron and steel plants, the daily production level of pig iron in the province has gradually increased. At present, the iron and steel workers in the province have set off a new upsurge in iron and steel production to fight hard in April and welcome "May Day." (Attached Picture)
    After technical transformation, the average utilization coefficient of the small blast furnace of Dongxiang Iron and Steel Plant in Jiangxi Province has jumped sharply from 0.845 to 5. This is a corner of the small blast furnace group of Dongxiang Iron and Steel Plant.

    坚定自力更生信念　增强各县工业基础
    江西小高炉大改造大发展
    半个月恢复和新建小高炉七十多座，三十多座进行了技术改造
    本报南昌24日电　江西省进一步贯彻大中小相结合的方针，正大力恢复、改造和新建大批炼铁小高炉，大搞钢铁“小土群”和“小洋群”，力争钢铁生产更大跃进。据4月中旬的不完全统计，全省在半个月内，恢复、新建小高炉有七十余座，并对三十余座小高炉进行了技术改造。
    坚持政治挂帅，加强组织领导，领导亲临炉边，是江西迅速掀起钢铁生产新高潮的重要保证。各地在组织这次钢铁生产高潮时，组织干部普遍进行了一次严肃的思想检查；在检查中，用许多小高炉高产优质的生动事例，批判了某些人轻视小高炉的错误认识，进一步坚定了长期贯彻大中小结合、土洋并举的信念。在统一思想以后，各专区都分别成立和健全了钢铁领导小组，各县成立了钢铁生产办公室，具体指挥、检查小高炉的恢复、改造和建设、生产等工作。同时建立了一天一汇报，三天一检查，七天一评比的制度进行检查督促。
    依靠群众，自力更生，各方面协作，是江西各地大办小型钢铁厂、大建小高炉的一个显著特点。上饶专区为了解决恢复、新建小高炉的资金、设备和材料不足的问题，一面普遍压缩了一批非生产性建设项目，腾出一批资金投入小高炉建设；另一方面，充分发动各部门和广大群众，采取找、挖、代、协、借等多种办法，搞出钢材、水泥等三百多吨。全省各地机械、建筑、安装等有关部门，也都把支援小高炉的建设和改造工作列为本部门的重要任务，千方百计为高炉的建设和生产解决困难问题。
    为了使恢复和新建的小高炉迅速投入生产，全省各地还抓紧了原料、燃料的生产、储备、运输等一系列生产准备工作。吉安专区在4月上旬抽调了三千多名在1958年炼过铁的“土专家”，开赴炼铁基地参加炉前操作。乐平县横路钢铁厂职工边基建边备料，到4月上旬止，就为正在新建的小高炉备足了半年的矿石。
    各地在大建“小土群”、“小洋群”钢铁企业的同时，还加强了对原有钢铁企业的领导，对所有高炉抓紧进行了技术改造，广泛开展了技术革命运动，高炉平均利用系数一般都有很大提高。
    由于大批小高炉投入生产，以及各个钢铁厂技术改造后生产能力进一步提高，全省生铁日产水平逐步上升。目前，全省钢铁职工已掀起了大战4月、迎接“五一”的钢铁生产新高潮。（附图片）
    江西省东乡钢铁厂小高炉经过技术改造，小高炉平均利用系数由过去的0.845猛跃到5。这是东乡钢铁厂小高炉炉群的一角
