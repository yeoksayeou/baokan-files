Comrade Chairman, fellow delegates:

After listening to the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, I felt extremely excited and greatly encouraged. I completely agree with and firmly support them.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, our people across the country have been full of spirit and soaring enthusiasm, working hard to accelerate socialist construction. It is entirely understandable that the people of a country that has long been in a backward state have such a state of mind. Take steel production as an example, from 158,000 tons in 1949 to 13.35 million tons last year (1959), China's steel production has increased dozens or even nearly a hundredfold in just ten years. We have completed in just ten years the road that other countries took half a century to complete. This is a miracle in the history of China and the world! This miracle is undeniable by anyone or any country! This miracle itself shows the greatness and correctness of the General Line, and is inseparable from the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

Although China's steel production has made amazing achievements, from the perspective of a large country with 650 million people, and from the perspective of the urgent need of the people of the whole country to change China's poor and backward state, our steel production is still not enough. We need to continue to work hard to achieve greater achievements. When it comes to steel production, we can only start from two aspects: increasing steel production and improving steel quality. The main key is to vigorously carry out technological innovation and mass technological revolution movements. Therefore, how to accelerate the use and promotion of new technologies in China's steelmaking industry has become an important issue at present. The following are some of my personal views, please criticize and correct them:

I. Oxygen Supply. The Manufacture of Oxygen Generators and Their Materials: Oxygen metallurgy is of utmost importance in ferrous metallurgy because it can accelerate the smelting process and improve production and quality. Countries around the world are now making various efforts to popularize and promote the use of oxygen metallurgy. The Soviet Union has made significant achievements in this area. At the 20th Party Congress, it was pointed out that by 1960, the extent to which the country uses oxygen steelmaking should reach at least 40% of steel production. In China, oxygen has been widely used in electric furnace steelmaking. However, the application in open hearth furnaces, converters, and blast furnaces needs to be vigorously promoted. From the perspective of the needs of national development in the future, there are not enough factories manufacturing such oxygen generators, and it is difficult to meet the requirements of all parties. It is necessary to quickly establish more oxygen generator manufacturing plants. In addition to manufacturing large-scale oxygen generators, strengthening the manufacture of medium and small-sized oxygen generators to supply the needs of electric furnaces and converters across the country, so that oxygen metallurgy can blossom everywhere in China's steel bases in a shorter period of time! The research on materials related to this aspect, so that it can be more suitable for China's resource situation, is also not to be ignored.

II. Adoption and Trial Manufacture of New Refractory Materials. With the improvement of steel production and quality, it is becoming increasingly urgent to improve the quality of refractory materials. China has done a lot of work in this area and achieved great results. For example, the aluminum-magnesium bricks used in open hearth furnaces and the high-aluminum bricks used in electric furnaces can increase the furnace life to some extent. A more prominent problem is the furnace life of alkaline side-blown converters. The way to solve the problem of short furnace life, in addition to further improving the operating process, the selection of the material itself and the improvement of its quality, especially the improvement of dolomite furnace lining materials, such as stabilized sintered dolomite, is an important link at present. In addition, the supply of magnesia is also not to be ignored. China is a country with abundant reserves of magnesia. However, in order to meet the needs of the development of the national steel industry, especially to meet the needs of the regions, some new avenues can also be opened up. For example, extracting magnesia from seawater is one example. The magnesia extracted from seawater not only has a high magnesia content but also has a low impurity content, so it is easier to control in terms of quality than mineral products. The United Kingdom conducted a trial production in 1937, and only recently set up a factory for production. According to its estimates, it can save 4 million pounds in foreign exchange every year, and can also export some products, which can also generate 1 million pounds in foreign exchange every year. China has a vast coastline and can choose appropriate areas along the coast to set up factories for trial production. In addition to the above-mentioned artificially extracted refractory materials, methods must be found to adopt other natural refractory rocks, and resources for refractory materials must be developed in many ways.

III. Adoption of New Equipment and New Smelting Methods. In terms of alkaline side-blown converters, China has made many innovations and improvements, making it an effective steelmaking tool that is currently widely used in China. However, due to the easy erosion of the furnace lining and the small capacity, there are certain limitations. Therefore, in addition to carrying out some technological innovation work on the cupola and the converter itself, in order to improve the quality of converter steel and catch up with the open hearth furnace, some new steelmaking methods can be adopted. Among them, the top-blown oxygen method is more suitable for China because the equipment is simpler, the capacity is also larger, ranging from dozens of tons to eighty or ninety tons per furnace. Low-carbon ductile steel and various alloy steels can be produced, and the quality is completely equal to that of open hearth steel. Countries have gradually adopted it. In North American countries, the annual output of steel made by this method reached more than 5.2 million tons in 1959. Japan will also use this method to make steel within three years, and the estimated annual output will reach more than 4 million tons, accounting for about a quarter of the total output. Friendly neighbor the Soviet Union has made great progress in this area, and several factories have adopted this method to make steel. The late Soviet Deputy Dean, Academician Bardin, once said: "Oxygen top-blown converter plus continuous casting is a technological revolution in the current metallurgical industry." China's competent authorities have paid attention to this. More spots can be selected to carry out this at the same time. After the mass production of oxygen generators, such converters can be widely set up and promoted, so that China's steel production and quality can have a greater harvest!

IV. Mechanization and Automation in Steel Production. Heavy and large-scale enterprises must first be mechanized and automated. This already has a certain foundation in China's large-scale steel plants. However, many newly established medium and small-sized steel plants have a poor degree of mechanization. High-temperature and heavy operations have a high labor intensity. In the current upsurge of the technological revolution movement, we must fully mobilize the masses so that these factories can do their best to achieve mechanization in every link, from the loading and unloading of raw materials, into the furnace, the transportation and processing of semi-finished products to the factory, and strive to achieve automation and semi-automation in certain processes, in order to adapt to the current greater leap forward in China's steel industry.

V. The Cooperation of Universities and Colleges in Scientific Research. Since the teaching revolution two years ago, universities and colleges have played an increasingly significant role in labor production, scientific research, and other aspects. High-grade students in universities and colleges, even second and third-grade students, can let go of scientific research in an organized and led manner, creating a vigorous and vigorous situation of doing scientific research in a big way. This is a strong scientific research team with great potential strength, which deserves our double attention. Therefore, in the future scientific research planning, arrangements, and the establishment of scientific research bases, etc., the potential of universities and colleges should be fully considered so that it can play a greater role in the future scientific research.

Fellow delegates: We are now facing the first year of the great 1960s, we are carrying out a larger-scale sustained leap forward, and we are doing things that our predecessors dared not think or do. Of course, the task is glorious and arduous, and it is impossible for us not to encounter difficulties on our road forward. But we firmly believe that under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, holding high the great banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the people of the whole country, united in one heart and one mind, will surely be able to overcome any difficulties, leap forward to advance our steel industry and other heavy industries, and with the cooperation of all parties, make our country a modern industrial country in a very short period of time!

    加速推广炼钢新技术
    周志宏代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    听了李富春、李先念两位副总理所作报告，感到非常兴奋，受到很大鼓舞，我完全同意并坚决地表示拥护。
    从1958年大跃进以来，我们全国人民意气风发，干劲冲天，在为加速社会主义建设而努力。一个长期处于落后状态的国家人民具有这样的一种心情是完全可以理解的。我们就拿钢产量一项来说，从1949年的十五万八千吨到去年（1959年）的一千三百三十五万吨，在短短十年中我国的钢产量成几十倍以至近百倍的在增长着。我们在短短十年走完了别的国家要化半个世纪才能走完的道路，这是古今中外史上的一个奇迹！这个奇迹，是任何人，任何国家所不能抹杀的！这个奇迹的本身，也就说明了总路线的伟大和正确性，是和党，毛主席的英明领导，分不开的。
    我国的钢产量虽然取得了惊人的成就，但是从我国具有六亿五千万人口这样一个大国来说，从全国人民迫切要求改变我国一穷二白落后的面貌来说，我们的钢产量还是不够的，需要我们继续努力，以取得更大的成就。谈到钢的生产，不外是从提高钢的产量和改善钢的品质二个方面来着手，而其中主要关键就是大闹技术革新开展群众性的技术革命运动。因此，在我国炼钢事业中如何加速新技术的使用和推广就成为当前一项重要课题，下面提出我个人的一些看法，敬请批评指正：
    一、氧气供应。氧气机的制造及其材料问题——氧气冶炼，在黑色冶金中具有极其重要的意义。因为它可以加速冶炼的过程，提高产量和质量。现在世界各国都在为氧气冶炼的普遍使用和推广作着各种努力。苏联在这方面已取得了显著的成绩，在第二十次党代表大会中已指出到1960年全国利用氧气炼钢的程度至少要达到钢产量的40％。我国在电炉炼钢方面已普遍地采用氧气。但是在平炉、转炉、高炉的应用方面，还有待于大力的推广。从全国今后发展的需要来说，这类制造氧气机的工厂，还嫌不够，难以适应各方面的要求，需要迅速设立更多的氧气机制造厂。除制造大型氧气机外，加强中小型氧气机的制造供应全国各地电炉转炉的需要，使氧气冶炼在更短的期间内在我国各钢铁基地普遍开花！对有关这方面材料的研究，便能更适合我国的资源情况，也是不可忽视的。
    二、新型耐火材料的采用及试制。随着钢铁产量和质量的提高，越来越迫切地要求提高耐火材料的质量。我国在这方面做了不少的工作，取得很大的成绩。如平炉采用的铝镁砖，电炉采用的高铝砖，都能使炉龄有所提高，比较突出的是碱性侧吹转炉的炉龄问题。解决炉龄短促的办法，除了进一步改进操作工艺外，材料本身的选择及其质量的改进，特别是白云石炉衬材料的改进，如稳定烧结白云石等方面是当前的一个重要环节。此外如镁砂的供应亦同样不可忽视，我国是镁砂蕴藏丰富的一个国家，但为了适应全国钢铁工业发展的需要，尤其是为了适应地区的需要，还可以开辟一些新的途径。如从海水中取氧化镁就是一个例子。从海水中提取氧化镁，不但含氧化镁量高而且杂质的含量少，所以在质量上就比矿产的易于控制。英国在1937年曾进行过一度试制，最近才设厂生产。据其估计每年可节约外汇四百万镑，并有部分产品外销，每年还可收入外汇一百万镑。我国海岸辽阔，可以在沿海选择适当地区进行设厂试制。除上述人工提制的耐火材料外，对其他天然的耐火岩石都须设法寻求采用，多方面开辟耐火材料的资源。
    三、新设备和新熔炼方法的采用。在碱性侧吹转炉方面，我国有很多创造与改进，成为我国目前普遍采用的一种有效的炼钢工具。但是由于炉衬易侵蚀，容量不大，有其一定的限制，因此，除了在化铁炉和转炉本身进行一些技术革新工作外，为了改进转炉钢质量赶上平炉，可采取一些新的炼钢方法，其中以全氧顶吹的方法对我国比较合适。因为设备较简，容量亦较大，每炉从十数吨以至八、九十吨，可以制炼低炭易延钢，及各种合金钢，质量完全与平炉钢相等。各国已逐渐在采用。北美国家中用这种方法炼成的钢到1959年年产量已达到五百二十多万吨，日本也将于三年内采用这种方法炼钢，预计年产量可达四百多万吨，约占总产量的四分之一。友邦苏联在这方面有很大的进展，已有好几个厂采用这种方法炼钢。已故苏联副院长巴尔金院士曾这样说：“氧气顶吹转炉加上连续铸锭是当前冶金工业上的技术革命”我国主管部门对此已加注意。可多选择几个点同时进行，在氧气机大量生产以后，就可以普遍设置这样的转炉并加以推广，使我国钢的产量质量能有更大的丰收！
    四、钢铁生产中的机械化和自动化。重型与大型的企业首先要机械化自动化，这在我国的大型钢铁厂已经具有了一定的基础。但是许多新建立的中小型钢铁厂机械化程度较差。高温繁重的操作，劳动强度较高，在当前大闹技术革命运动的高潮中，要充分发动群众，使这些工厂从原料的装卸、入炉，半成品的输送加工直至出厂，在每个环节上尽量做到机械化，在若干工序上力求达到自动化，半自动化，以适应当前我国钢铁工业的更大跃进。
    五、高等学校在科学研究事业中的配合问题。从前年教学大革命以来，高等学校在劳动生产，科研等各方面起着越来越显著的作用，高等学校的高年级同学，甚至二、三年级都能在有组织有领导下放手搞科研，造成轰轰烈烈大搞科研的局面，这是一支强大的科研队伍，有着很大的潜在的力量，值得我们加倍注视。所以在今后的科研规划，安排以及科研基地的建立等各方面都应充分考虑到高等学校的潜力，使它能在今后的科学研究事业中发挥更大的作用。
    各位代表：我们现在面临着伟大的六十年代的第一年，我们正在进行着更大规模的持续跃进，我们做着前人所不敢想不敢做的事。当然，任务是光荣而艰巨的，在我们前进的道路上也不可能不遭迂到困难。但是我们坚决相信，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，高举总路线，大跃进，人民公社的伟大旗帜，全国人民，同心同德，我们一定能战胜任何困难，把我国的钢铁工业和其他重工业，飞跃地推向前进，在各方面的配合下，使我国能在很短时间内建成为一个现代化的工业国家！
