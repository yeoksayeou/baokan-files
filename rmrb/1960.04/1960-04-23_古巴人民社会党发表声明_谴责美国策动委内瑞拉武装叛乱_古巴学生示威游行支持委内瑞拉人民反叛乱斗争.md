Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 20th – The National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party issued a statement tonight on the situation in Venezuela, saying, "The enemies of the Venezuelan people, war criminals, counter-revolutionaries, and the US imperialists who support and orchestrate them, have launched a heinous coup in an attempt to destroy the democratic achievements of the revolution, prevent the advance of the Venezuelan workers and people's democratic forces, and restore the rule of agents of the most aggressive foreign monopolies in Venezuela."

The statement pointed out that although the leaders of this rebellion are trying to conceal where they are getting support, "everyone can judge that they are primarily at the command of US imperialism, at the command of the oil companies that plunder Venezuela, and the most vicious and insidious power groups of the present time."

The statement continued, "At the same time that this counter-revolutionary coup is taking place in Venezuela, preparations are underway for an invasion of Cuba. Washington is attempting to organize a group to use as a club against the Cuban revolution in the name of the Organization of American States." The statement pointed out: Part of this conspiracy is to pull Venezuela, Colombia, and other countries in the Caribbean region into this group, and therefore to try to remove obstacles to its policy of aggression, especially to stop the growing support of the brotherly people of Venezuela for the Cuban revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 21st – Thousands of Cuban university and middle school students held a march and mass rally in Havana at noon today in support of the Venezuelan people's struggle against the military rebellion, condemning the instigator of this coup – US imperialism – and reaffirming their support for the Venezuelan people's fight against the rebellion.

In his speech at the rally, Angel Quevedo, Secretary-General of the Cuban University Student Federation, pointed out that aggression against Venezuela is a prelude to aggression against Cuba. He warned that the US Marines and Herter should know that if they dare to attack Cuba, they will only be left with their bones.

Rolando Cubelas, President of the University Student Federation, when condemning the instigators of the Venezuelan rebellion, said that US imperialism is the common enemy of Cuba and Venezuela, plundering oil in Venezuela and sugar in Cuba.

    古巴人民社会党发表声明
    谴责美国策动委内瑞拉武装叛乱
    古巴学生示威游行支持委内瑞拉人民反叛乱斗争
    据新华社哈瓦那20日电　古巴人民社会党全国委员会今晚就委内瑞拉局势发表声明说，“委内瑞拉人民的敌人，战争罪犯、反革命分子以及支持和策动这些人的美帝国主义分子发动了一次罪恶的政变，企图摧毁革命所取得的民主成果，阻止委内瑞拉工人和人民民主力量的前进，使最富于侵略性的外国垄断集团代理人的统治在委内瑞拉复辟。”
    声明指出，虽然这次叛乱的领导者企图隐瞒他们从什么地方得到支持，“但是所有的人都能判断，他们首先是听命于美帝国主义，听命于掠夺委内瑞拉的石油公司和当前最凶恶阴险的势力集团的。”
    声明接着说，“在委内瑞拉发生这一次反革命政变的同时，正在进行着侵略古巴的准备工作。华盛顿妄图组织一个集团，以便在美洲国家组织的名义下用这个集团来做为反对古巴革命的大棒。”声明指出：这一阴谋的一部分就是把委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚以及加勒比地区的其他国家拉进这一集团，因此就力图为它的侵略政策扫除障碍，特别是制止日益增涨的委内瑞拉的兄弟人民对古巴革命的支持。
    据新华社哈瓦那21日电　成千上万的古巴大学生和中学生今天中午在哈瓦那举行支援委内瑞拉人民反对军事叛乱的游行示威和群众大会，谴责这次政变的策动者——美帝国主义，并且重申支持委内瑞拉人民反对叛乱的斗争。
    古巴大学生联合会总书记安赫耳·克维多少校在大会上的讲话中指出，对委内瑞拉的侵略是侵略古巴的前奏。他警告说，美国海军陆战队和赫脱应该知道，假如他们胆敢进攻古巴，他们将只会剩下自己的骨头。
    大学生联合会主席罗兰多·库维拉斯少校在谴责委内瑞拉叛乱的策动者时说，美帝国主义是古巴和委内瑞拉的共同敌人，它在委内瑞拉掠夺石油，在古巴掠夺食糖。
