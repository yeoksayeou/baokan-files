Learning Pinyin Accelerates Elimination of Illiteracy
Phonetic Literacy Campaigns Launched in Many Parts of the Country

    This newspaper reports that since January of this year, a phonetic literacy campaign using the Pinyin alphabet to eliminate illiteracy and consolidate and expand literacy achievements is vigorously underway in provinces such as Shanxi, Shandong, Jilin, Anhui, Sichuan, and Liaoning.
    Following a provincial on-site meeting on phonetic literacy in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee issued on February 11th a directive "On comprehensively promoting the use of Pinyin to improve the cultural and scientific knowledge of workers and peasants and to promote Mandarin." The directive required all cities and counties to rapidly launch a movement for workers and peasants to learn the Pinyin alphabet, treating it as a powerful tool for eliminating illiteracy, consolidating and expanding literacy achievements, engaging in extensive reading of Pinyin materials, and promoting Mandarin. Currently, the entire province of Shanxi, with the exception of the Jinan Special District which has already fully launched the campaign, is actively training teachers and preparing for vigorous promotion. The phonetic literacy campaign in the nineteen cities and counties of Jinan is continuing to surge forward. According to statistics from mid-February, over 1,210,000 workers and peasants in the region are participating in learning. Because the masses have mastered this literacy tool, the pace of literacy has greatly accelerated, relapses into illiteracy have been overcome, and the teaching efficiency of spare-time schools has also improved daily. After the implementation of phonetic literacy in Hongdong County, the number of graduates from literacy classes in January surged to 8,000, a fourfold increase compared to the number of graduates in December of last year (before learning Pinyin). Many areas in Jinan have set up "Phonetic Literacy Leap Forward Platforms" in rural areas and construction sites, using the method of annotating 1,500, 2,000, or 3,000 Chinese characters with Pinyin letters, writing them on the walls of streets and all public places, allowing the masses to learn at any time. The promotion of phonetic annotation on blackboards in Ruicheng County has also played the same role. The promotion of phonetic literacy has also had the following effect: areas where literacy and spare-time education were previously poorly developed have now caught up with the advanced, and many students with poor learning conditions have become learning pacesetters. Ren Yulan, an illiterate woman with five children from the Xionghuo People's Commune in Hongdong County, used to learn very poorly. This time, after seven evenings of learning, she mastered Hanyu Pinyin, and a little over a month later, she read three Pinyin books such as "Sisters-in-law Looking at Pictures." After the promotion of phonetic literacy, the number of elderly people participating in learning in Jinan reached more than 80,000, a fourfold increase compared to before the promotion of phonetic literacy. The main reasons for the good progress of the campaign in Jinan Special District are: first, Party committees at all levels have strengthened leadership, and cadres at all levels have generally taken the lead in learning the Pinyin alphabet; second, teachers have been actively trained, with specific methods being used such as county, commune, and management district-level training, mobilizing primary and secondary school teachers and students to serve as tutors and provide assistance, and adopting methods such as learning while teaching, and learning before teaching. Currently, Jinan has trained more than 65,000 Pinyin teachers, with an average of one teacher for every nineteen young adults. Linquan County has trained 13,400 teachers, with an average of one teacher for every six young adults. After the launch of the phonetic literacy campaign, more than 860,000 people in Jinan have basically mastered the Pinyin alphabet, and a mass reading movement is underway throughout Jinan. Jinzhong Special District has designated Xiyang and Taigu as key areas for comprehensive development, and each county and city is conducting a phonetic literacy pilot program in every people's commune. Currently, teachers are being actively trained, and teaching materials and Pinyin reading materials are being planned. A total of 44,459 workers and peasants are participating in learning in the 1,911 grassroots units in the region that are conducting phonetic literacy. Many cities and counties in Jin Southeast and Jin North Special Districts are also actively training teachers in preparation for carrying out phonetic literacy.
    The phonetic literacy campaign is being actively carried out in Pingyuan, Qingdao, Zibo, Yiyuan, and other cities and counties in Shandong Province. According to statistics from January, more than 250,000 rural young adults in Pingyuan County are participating in learning, including more than 1,100 commune-level cadres and more than 6,400 production team cadres. Cadres taking the lead in learning has greatly encouraged the learning enthusiasm of the masses. Through extensive reading of Pinyin reading materials, 70,000 literacy graduates have been promoted to spare-time senior primary school classes. On March 15th, the Shandong Provincial Department of Education held a provincial on-site meeting on phonetic literacy teaching and the supply of phonetic reading materials in Pingyuan County. The meeting required all grassroots cadres, employees, peasant literacy classes, and students in spare-time schools throughout the province to learn the Pinyin alphabet as a powerful tool to accelerate the elimination of illiteracy, consolidate and expand literacy achievements, and rapidly improve political, technical, and cultural levels. Currently, 3,180,000 people in the province have participated in phonetic literacy learning.
    On February 29th, the Jilin Provincial People's Committee issued a "Notice on vigorously promoting phonetic literacy in a planned way throughout the province," requiring all special districts and counties to select one or several communes or management districts, streets, factories, and mines for experimentation, to quickly figure out teaching experience, and then to switch to comprehensive promotion in a planned way. Thirteen cities and counties in Jilin Province have successively carried out phonetic literacy work. According to the experience of pilot projects in the Chaluhe People's Commune in Yongji County and the Wukeshu People's Commune in Yushu County, it only takes one hundred and several tens of hours to eliminate illiteracy, so it is welcomed by the masses. Yongji County has achieved successful experience in carrying out the phonetic literacy campaign in 32 management districts of eight communes. The Jilin Provincial Department of Education will hold a provincial on-site meeting on phonetic literacy in Yongji County at the end of March.
    Zhuanghe County in Liaoning Province has organized 2,747 spare-time senior primary school classes and 276 spare-time junior high school classes, with a total of 80,000 students learning the Pinyin alphabet. Dalian Shipyard is launching a "Ten Thousand Workers Learning Pinyin Movement." Eight communes in Kaiyuan County are carrying out pilot work for "large-area bumper harvest" of phonetic literacy, with 15,000 illiterate people and 18,000 literacy graduates involved in this movement.
    Rong County, Fushun, Luzhou, Zigong, Longchang, and other cities and counties in Sichuan Province are rapidly expanding the scope of pilot projects. Rong County and Luzhou City have formed a mass movement for the whole people to learn Pinyin. Through short-term concentrated efforts in Fushun County, 3,247 people's teachers were trained in less than a month.
    In addition, Anhui Province is conducting pilot projects in 27 cities and counties in the Bengbu and Fuyang special districts, Hubei Province is conducting pilot projects in 15 cities and counties such as Wuhan and Xiangfan, and Beijing is conducting pilot projects among some street residents, employees, and suburban farmers. To date, 18 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in the Mandarin-speaking area of the country have launched phonetic literacy campaigns on varying scales. (Xu Chong)

    学会拼音字母加速扫除文盲
    全国许多地区开展注音识字运动
    本报讯　今年1月以来，一个利用拼音字母扫除文盲和巩固扩大扫盲成果的注音识字运动正在山西、山东、吉林、安徽、四川、辽宁等省蓬勃开展。
    山西省在万荣县召开全省注音扫盲现场会议之后，山西省人民委员会于2月11日发出了“关于全面推行利用拼音字母提高工农群众的文化科学知识水平和推广普通话”的指示，要求各市、县迅速开展工农群众学习拼音字母运动，把它作为扫除文盲、巩固扩大扫盲成果、开展大量阅读注音读物、推广普通话的有力工具。现在山西全省，除晋南专区已经全面开展外，其他专区也在积极培训师资，准备大力推广。晋南十九个市、县的注音识字运动在继续高涨，根据2月中旬的统计，全区参加学习的工农群众达一百二十一万多人。由于群众掌握
  了这个识字工具，扫盲速度大大加快，复盲现象克服，业余学校的教学效率也日见提高。洪洞县推行注音扫盲后，1月份扫盲班毕业人数猛增到八千人，比去年12月份（未学拼音）毕业人数增加四倍。晋南许多地区在农村、工地上大摆“注音识字跃进台”，办法是：把一千五百个、二千或三千个汉字，逐字注上拼音字母，写在街道和一切公共场所的墙上，让群众随时学习。芮城县推行黑板报注音，也起了同样的作用。推行注音识字，还起了这样的作用：过去扫盲和业余教育开展较差的地区，现在赶上了先进，不少学习条件差的学员变成了学习标兵。洪洞县雄火人民公社一个有五个孩子的文盲任玉兰，过去学得很不好，这次经过七个晚上的学习，掌握了汉语拼音，一个多月后，她就阅读了“姑嫂看画”等三本注音读物。推行注音识字以后，晋南全区参加学习的老年人已达八万余人，比未推行注音识字前增加了四倍。晋南专区运动开展得好的主要原因：第一是各级党委加强领导，各级干部普遍带头学习拼音字母，第二是积极培训了师资，具体做法是县、公社、管理区分级培训，并采取了发动中小学师生担任辅导和包教，抽调力量进行突击支援，边学边教、先学后教等办法。目前晋南全区已培训拼音师资六万五千多人，平均每十九个青壮年有一个教师。临猗县培训了一万三千四百名教师，平均每六个青壮年就有一名教师。注音识字运动开展后，晋南全区已有八十六万多人基本掌握拼音字母，一个群众性的大量阅读运动，正在晋南各地开展起来。晋中专区已确定昔阳、太谷为重点，全面开展以外，各县、市在每一个人民公社内都搞一个注音识字试点、目前正在积极培训师资，筹划教材和注音读物。全区进行注音识字的一千九百一十一个基层单位，参加学习的工农群众共达四万四千四百五十九人。晋东南、晋北专区的许多市、县，也在积极培训师资，为开展注音识字进行准备。
    山东省平原、青岛、淄博、沂源等市、县注音识字运动正在积极开展。据1月份统计，平原县有二十五万多农村青壮年参加学习，其中有一千一百多名公社一级干部和六千四百多名生产队干部。干部带头学习，大大鼓舞了群众的学习热情。通过大量阅读注音读物，已经有七万脱盲学员升入业余高小班。山东省教育厅3月15日在平原县召开全省注音扫盲教学和注音读物供应现场会议，会议要求全省所有基层干部、职工、农民扫盲班和业余学校的学员，都要学会拼音字母，作为加速扫除文盲、巩固扩大扫盲成果，迅速提高政治、技术、文化水平的有力工具。目前全省已有三百一十八万人参加了注音识字学习。
    吉林省人民委员会于2月29日发出“关于在全省范围内有步骤地大力推行注音扫盲”的通知，要求各专署、县选择一个或几个公社或管理区、街道、厂矿进行试验，迅速摸出教学经验，然后有步骤地转入全面推广。吉林省先后有十三个市、县进行了注音扫盲工作，根据永吉县岔路河人民公社和榆树县五棵树人民公社试点的经验，扫除一个文盲只要一百几十个小时，因此受到群众欢迎。永吉县在八个公社的三十二个管理区开展注音扫盲运动取得了成功的经验，吉林省教育厅将于3月底在永吉县召开全省注音扫盲现场会议。
    辽宁省庄河县组织了二千七百四十七个业余高小班和二百七十六个业余初中班，共八万名学员学习拼音字母。大连市造船厂正在掀起一个“万名工人学习拼音运动”的热潮。开原县八个公社都在开展注音识字“大面积丰产”的试点工作，有一万五千名文盲和一万八千名脱盲学员卷入这个运动。
    四川省荣县、富顺、泸州、自贡、隆昌等市、县迅速扩大试点范围，荣县和泸州市已经形成全民性的群众学习拼音运动。富顺县通过短期突击，不到一个月，培训了三千二百四十七名民师。
    此外，安徽省在蚌埠、阜阳两个专区二十七个市、县，湖北省在武汉、襄樊等十五个市、县，北京市在一部分街道居民、职工和市郊农民中正在进行试点。到目前为止，全国普通话区，已有十八个省、市、自治区在不同规模上开展着注音识字运动。　（许重）
