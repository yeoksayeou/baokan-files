This newspaper reported from Tianjin on the 5th of April: "Sow a single high-quality seed in the spring, and harvest ten thousand grains of good crops in the autumn." To seize large-scale high yields, the broad masses of commune members in Hebei Province have launched a mass movement to build high-quality seed breeding bases and carefully select and exchange high-quality seeds. As of March 24th, according to preliminary statistics from Tianjin and Shijiazhuang alone, 3.43 million mu of high-quality seed bases for various crops such as rice, corn, sorghum, millet, sweet potatoes, cotton, and peanuts have been established, accounting for 72.9% of the planned high-quality seed base area.

A prominent feature of this movement is that the secretaries take the lead, focusing on key tasks, creating models, holding on-site meetings, and achieving overall development. The Secretary of the Shulu County Party Committee took the lead, with the County Head directing, organizing agriculture, grain, and commerce departments to establish a Seed Revolution Committee. They adopted a method of using key points to drive the overall effort, combining key points with overall development, and achieving comprehensive progress, dispatching sixty-three cadres to Yao Tou, Tong Lan, and other five villages to cultivate key areas to promote the movement. Ji County focused on four communes, including Dachang and Chengguan, to create models, organizing on-site visits to seed infrastructure construction, and launching a massive "five specialization" (special land, special team, special field, special storage, special personnel), "eight-ization" (comprehensive improvement of varieties, seed standardization, systematic cultivation, variety diversification, reasonable matching, regional planting, pest and disease elimination, and management institutionalization) red flag competition movement. To date, each commune in the county has established twelve high-quality seed breeding farms, and production teams have established 150,000 mu of high-quality seed bases, with 798 fixed professional teams and 32,000 laborers involved, achieving "every commune has a farm, every team has a base." In the process of establishing high-quality seed breeding bases, all localities have adhered to the principle of adapting to local conditions, establishing various types of high-quality seed bases based on the current system of people's communes, such as "team-run," "commune-run," "commune-assisted team-run," and "team-to-team joint operation" in areas with better mass conditions and production conditions, based on the production team.

With the establishment of high-quality seed bases, a massive mass movement of careful selection and exchange of high-quality seeds has also rapidly developed in various localities. Selecting seeds, exchanging seeds, identifying seeds, and sunning seeds to achieve comprehensive improvement of varieties in 1960 has become a mass activity. In Tianjin, more than 180,000 laborers have been involved in seed selection, selecting 4.86 million jin of high-quality rice seeds, 11.02 million jin of corn, 8.06 million jin of peanuts, 2.15 million jin of soybeans, 120 million jin of sweet potatoes, and 16.41 million jin of cotton, basically achieving variety improvement. Chengguan Commune in Nangong County relied on the masses to vigorously carry out all-people seed selection, adopting methods such as selecting seeds after meals, during rest periods, taking time, squeezing time, contracting work, ensuring quality, contracting tasks, and rewarding over-fulfillment, carefully selecting 1.5 million jin of high-quality cotton seeds, increasing seed purity from 80% to over 95%. At the same time, mass seed competitions, comparison plantings, and seed donation conferences have been continuously carried out within teams, communes, and counties. According to preliminary statistics from thirteen counties including Hengshui, Ningjin, and Gaocheng, 41.12 million jin of seeds have been donated and exchanged. This not only ensures the completion of the sowing plan but, more importantly, improves seed quality and achieves comprehensive variety improvement.

In the mass movement of building high-quality seed bases and vigorously carrying out careful selection and exchange of high-quality seeds, all localities have strengthened warehouse storage and management. According to incomplete statistics from ten counties, including Wuqing, Jiaohe, Renqiu, Hejian, Yanshan, Cangxian, Ningjin, Baxian, Wuqiao, and Ji County, 20,000 rooms for high-quality seed storage have been established. Renqiu County alone has established 4,581 special warehouses, with each warehouse assigning fixed personnel to achieve professional management, and strictly ensuring that each warehouse has a sign, each storage unit has a number, each seed has a name, and each cellar has a map. Seeds basically achieve "dry, clean, pure, plump, and high germination rate."

    为大面积丰产创造良好条件
    河北广泛建立优良种子基地
    同时开展精选互换，争取实现全面良种化
    本报天津5日电　“春种一粒良种，秋收万粒好粮”。河北省广大社员群众，为夺取大面积丰产，掀起大建良种繁育基地和精选、互换良种的群众运动。截至3月24日，仅据天津、石家庄两市初步统计，已建起水稻、玉米、高粱、谷子、甘薯、棉花、花生等各种作物良种基地三百四十三万亩，占应建良种基地计划的72.9％。
    书记动手，抓重点、搞样板，召开现场会议，全面开花是这次运动的突出特点。束鹿县书记挂帅，县长指挥，组织农、粮、商成立种子革命委员会，采取以点带面，点面结合，全面开花的办法，抽调六十三名干部分赴摇头、同兰等五个村培养重点推动运动。蓟县以大厂、城关等四个公社为重点搞出样板，组织现场参观种子基本建设，掀起了一个声势浩大的“五专”（专地、专队、专场、专库、专人）、“八化”（全面优种化、种子标准化、培育系统化、品种多样化、搭配合理化、种植区域化、病虫双无化、管理制度化）的红旗竞赛运动。到目前为止全县各公社建立良种繁育场十二个，生产队建立良种基地十五万亩，固定专业队七百九十八个，投入劳力三万二千人，实现了“社社有场，队队有基地”。各地在建立良种繁育基地的过程中，都本着因地制宜的原则，在群众条件和生产条件较好地区，以生产队为基础的根据人民公社现行体制建立起“队有队营”，“社有社营”、“社助队营”、“队间联营”等各种不同类型的良种基地。
    随着良种基地的建立，一个声势浩大的群众性的良种精选互换运动，也在各地迅速开展起来。选种、换种、鉴定、晒种为实现1960年全面优种化，已成为群众性的活动。天津市在选种工作中投入劳力十八万多人，已选出水稻良种四百八十六万斤，玉米一千一百零二万斤，花生八百零六万斤，大豆二百一十五万斤，甘薯一亿二千万斤，棉花一千六百四十一万斤，基本实现了优种化。南宫县城关公社依靠群众大搞全民选种，采取吃饭后、休息时、抽时间、挤时间、包工、包质、包任务，超额奖励的办法精选棉花良种一百五十万斤，种子纯度由80％提高到95％以上。与此同时，群众性的赛种、比种和献种大会，在一队、一社、一县内连续开展起来。仅据衡水、宁津、藁城等十三个县初步统计，即献种、换种四千一百一十二万斤。这样就不仅保证了播种计划的完成，而更重要的是提高种子质量，实现全面优种化。
    在群众性的大建良种基地，大搞良种精选互换运动中，各地都加强了仓贮保管工作。据武清、交河、任丘、河间、盐山、沧县、宁津、霸县、吴桥、蓟县等十个县不完全统计，目前已经建立起良种等仓库两万间。任丘一县即建立专用库四千五百八十一间，库库作到固定专人，实现管理专业化，并严格的作到库有牌，囤有号，种有名，窖有图。种子基本达到“干、净、纯、饱、发芽率高”。
