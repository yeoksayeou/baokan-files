Public canteens are warm families
Speech by Representative Sun Xiangyun

Fellow representatives:
I wholeheartedly support the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now I will report to the conference on the situation of the public canteen in Yanglou Production Brigade, Jinglonggong People's Commune, Fengqiu County, Henan Province.

The public canteen of Yanglou Production Brigade was established in 1958 when the commune was realized. Originally, there were four canteens. Based on the favorable conditions of concentrated residence and the requirements of the commune members, it was merged into a large canteen with 1,058 people eating in the autumn of last year.

Since the establishment of the public canteen, the brigade Party branch has conscientiously implemented the relevant instructions of the higher-level Party committee on running the public canteen well. While rectifying, consolidating, and improving the people's commune, it has also carried out a series of rectification, consolidation, and improvement work on the public canteen. Now, this canteen is as solid as a rock and has become a strong socialist position of this brigade, a center of the political, economic, and cultural life of the commune members, and has demonstrated great superiority and infinite vitality in promoting the continuous leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, continuously improving the lives of commune members, and consolidating the people's commune system.

Yanglou Brigade has a large land area but a small population, and there is a chronic shortage of labor. Although the team has more than 1,000 people, only more than 300 full and semi-laborers can often work. Most of the women are entangled in housework and cannot directly participate in agricultural production. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, with the realization of the people's commune, collective living welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens were organized, freeing more than 220 young and middle-aged women from tedious housework and happily investing in industrial and agricultural production. The number of working laborers in the whole team jumped to more than 500, and more than 50,000 working days can be done throughout the year. In addition, the canteen eats neatly and starts work early, and can do two to three hours more work every day, and a total of 80,000 to 100,000 working days can be done throughout the year. In addition, the canteen ensures that the production army fights wherever it goes, and the meals and tea are delivered wherever they go, with enthusiastic service, ensuring that the commune members eat enough and eat well, which greatly encourages the enthusiasm of the masses and promotes the great development of production. In the past year or so, a total of 17 dry, branch, bucket, agricultural, and mao channels have been dug, and five high-bank water-carrying wells have been installed, enabling the team's 2,247 mu of cultivated land to realize water conservancy and obtain continuous bumper harvests in agricultural production.

Public canteens can not only guarantee the leap forward in production, but also are warm socialist families. With the continuous improvement of production and the consolidation of public canteens, the lives of commune members have been greatly improved. At present, the granary has wheat and various kinds of miscellaneous grains. If each person eats one jin per day, there will be more than 6,000 jin of surplus grain left until the wheat harvest. The canteen has planted a large number of vegetables to ensure that each person has three jin of vegetables to eat every day. Flour mills, tofu mills, soy sauce, pickles, oil, salt, and five flavors of seasonings are all available, and there are pig pens, sheep flocks, and fish ponds. Commune members can eat good meals every day, with steamed buns and soup for every meal, and hot rice and fragrant dishes. The canteen has realized restaurantization and table service. Every time they eat, the cooks deliver hot meals to the commune members. In addition to providing appropriate refined grain care for nurseries, kindergartens, nursing homes, and maternity hospitals, they can also give children two meals of goat milk every day. Such a happy life was something the masses never dared to think about in the old society. Zhao Jinbao, a 78-year-old commune member, said: "I had to beg for food during the Spring Festival in the old society. Now I am living such a happy life, and I will never forget Chairman Mao and the kindness of the commune in my life." Libraries, clubs, recreation rooms, and Red and Expert schools have been established around the canteen. Commune members use their spare time before and after meals to read newspapers, study Chairman Mao's works, play games, and take Red and Expert classes. The brigade and team meetings to study and arrange production are also conducted in the canteen. The "Red, Diligent, Skillful, and Thrifty" movement of cooks and administrators, as well as the comparison and competition of various learning and production among commune members, are also mostly publicized and praised in the canteen. The commune members' communist labor enthusiasm is increasing day by day, and the relationship between people has changed greatly. The Yang and Liu families, who have been at odds for a long time in history, are now harmonious. Now everyone's hearts are connected, and every household is as close as a family. Public canteens have not only broken through the feudal patriarchal system of thousands of years, but also overcome sectarian sentiments, so that every heart is closely connected and lives in a warm family.

How has the public canteen of this brigade been run well?

1.  Implement political command and resolutely establish the absolute leading advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants in the canteen. In addition to all 33 cadres of the entire brigade eating in the large canteen with the commune members and constantly listening to the opinions of the masses, the deputy secretary of the brigade and a member are in charge of the canteen work. At the same time, commune members are often educated to love the canteen as their home and the superiority of the public canteen. In addition, five landlords and rich peasants who were hiding in the cooking and management personnel were purged, incompetent cooking and management personnel were replaced, and the backbones of the Party and the Communist Youth League and the activists of poor and lower-middle peasants were strengthened. In addition, the destructive words and deeds of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements against the canteen were promptly cracked down.

2.  Conscientiously implemented the principles of planned grain use, saving grain, looking ahead and behind, running the canteen diligently and thriftily, and living a rich life as a poor life. A grain consumption plan was formulated according to the busy and slack agricultural work, so that the canteen had both dry and thin food in every meal, and the life was well-regulated, with refined grains continuously throughout the year, and coarse grains could still be eaten after the wheat harvest. The method of "rationing according to people, quotas to households, collective custody, dining with tickets, and savings to oneself" was implemented for commune members, achieving eating enough, eating well, eating sparingly, and eating cleanly and hygienically.

3.  Vigorously engaged in canteen family production and planted a large number of vegetables. In addition to the 60 mu of vegetables planted by the canteen, the brigade also planted 460 mu of pumpkins, winter melons, zucchini, etc. (in addition to ensuring that the canteen has three jin of vegetables per person per day, the surplus part supports the city, and the income belongs to the team); reclaimed 2,000 mu of land to grow vegetables. It is estimated that 1.2 million jin can be harvested, and more than 60,000 jin can be supported by the city after self-sufficiency. The canteen raises 38 pigs, 72 milk goats, and more than 30,000 fish (the large ones weigh six or seven jin), as well as small workshops such as flour mills, tofu mills, and pickle gardens. Basically, self-sufficiency in meat, fuel, oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar has been achieved, and the combination of staple and non-staple food has been realized, improving the lives of commune members. Because the canteen has a solid foundation, the commune members love the canteen even more. The commune members sang: "The public canteen is very good, and family production is really gratifying. The vegetables in the garden are endless, and the pigs, sheep, and carp are in groups. There are firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and a happy life has taken root."

4.  Implemented democratic management. The canteen has established a commune member representative meeting and a canteen management committee (composed of brigade and team leaders, women team leaders, administrator, cook representatives, and commune member representatives). The commune member representative meeting is held every half month to discuss the canteen's grain consumption plan, family production, financial revenue and expenditure, and meal lists. There are also suggestion boxes, release columns, account announcement columns, and commendation and criticism columns to widely absorb commune members' opinions and rationalization proposals to improve the canteen work. The canteen accounts are announced to the commune members every half month, and the monthly revenue and expenditure situation and the next month's living arrangements are reported to the commune members' meeting once a month, so that every commune member understands the canteen's foundation.

5.  Vigorously carried out tool reform. This canteen has realized the semi-mechanization of cutting vegetables, making steamed buns, kneading dough, and rolling noodles, the self-flowing of water, the power of grinding flour, and the forced ventilation of stoves. Using these improved cooking utensils has increased efficiency more than ten times compared with the past. In the past, twelve people could not cut enough vegetables in the morning to eat a meal of steamed buns, but now one person can operate the vegetable cutting machine and have more than enough. Forced-air stoves not only save coal (saving more than 360,000 jin per year), but also cook quickly, cleanly, and hygienically. Before the tool reform, a cook could only cook for an average of more than 30 people, but now he can cook for more than 60 people and still have time for rest, study, and entertainment.

6.  Carried out the "Red, Diligent, Skillful, and Thrifty" movement. Among the cooking and management personnel, the method of combining classroom education and work comparison and competition was adopted to carry out the "Red, Diligent, Skillful, and Thrifty" movement. The cooking and management personnel take classes every other day to study politics, business, and culture, and conduct regular comparisons and commendations. This greatly encourages the enthusiasm of the cooking and management personnel. They proposed to ensure that the commune members are satisfied, and to achieve two things that cannot be seen, that is, they cannot hear the commune members say that the food is not good, and they cannot see that the attitude of the cooking and management personnel is not good.

Although Yanglou Brigade has made remarkable achievements in running the canteen, there are still some shortcomings, and it is necessary to redouble our efforts to run the canteen better.

If there is anything inappropriate in the above speech, please correct me.

### 公共食堂是温暖的大家庭  孙香云代表的发言

    公共食堂是温暖的大家庭
    孙香云代表的发言各位代表：
    我衷心地拥护李富春、李先念副总理和人大常委所作的报告。现在我把河南省封丘县荆隆宫人民公社杨楼生产大队公共食堂的情况，向大会作一汇报。
    杨楼生产大队的公共食堂是在1958年实现公社化的时候建立的，原来共分四个食堂，根据居住集中的有利条件和社员的要求，于去年秋季合并成了一个拥有一千零五十八人吃饭的大食堂。
    公共食堂建立以来，大队党支部，认真贯彻执行了上级党委对办好公共食堂的有关指示，在整顿巩固和提高人民公社的同时，对公共食堂也进行了一系列的整顿巩固和提高工作。现在，这个食堂坚如磐石，已经成为这个大队坚强的社会主义阵地，成为社员的政治、经济、文化生活的中心，对于促进工农业生产的持续跃进、不断改善社员生活和巩固人民公社制度，都显示出巨大的优越性和无限的生命力。
    杨楼大队地多人少，常年劳力不足。全队虽有一千多口人，但经常能出勤的整、半劳力，才只有三百多个，妇女大部分被家务纠缠，不能直接参加农业生产。在1958年大跃进中，随着人民公社化的实现，组织了公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体生活福利事业，使全队二百二十多个青壮年妇女从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，轻松愉快地投入了工农业生产，全队出勤劳力一跃增加到五百多人，全年可多作五万多个劳动日。加上食堂吃饭齐、上工早，每天能多做二至三小时的活，全年共可多做八至十万个劳动日。再加上食堂做到了生产大军战斗到哪里，饭菜、茶水就送到哪里，服务热情，保证社员吃的饱，吃的好，这就大大鼓舞了群众的干劲，促进了生产的大发展。一年多来，共挖干、支、斗、农、毛渠十七条，高岸车水透河井五眼，使全队二千二百四十七亩耕地实现了水利化，获得了农业生产连续大丰收。
    公共食堂不仅能够保证生产跃进，而且是温暖的社会主义大家庭。随着生产的不断提高和公共食堂的巩固，社员生活有了很大改善。目前粮库里麦子、五谷杂粮各样品种都有，每人每天按一斤吃，到麦收还能余粮六千多斤。食堂种植了大量蔬菜，保证每人每天有三斤菜吃，粉坊、豆腐坊、酱油、咸菜、油、盐五味调料俱全，并有猪圈、羊群、鱼塘，社员们每天都能吃到很好的饭菜，顿顿有馍有汤，饭热菜香。食堂实现了餐厅化、餐桌化，每逢吃饭，炊事员都把热腾腾的饭菜送到社员面前，对托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、妇产院除给以适当细粮照顾外，还能给幼儿每天两顿羊奶吃。这样幸福的生活在旧社会里群众连想也没敢想过。七十八岁的老社员赵金宝说：“我在旧社会过年还得去要饭，现在过着这样幸福的生活，一辈子也忘不了毛主席和公社的恩情。”围绕食堂设立了图书馆、俱乐部、游艺室和红专学校，社员们在饭前饭后利用空隙时间，读报纸、学习毛主席著作，游戏娱乐，上红专课，大队、小队开会研究布置生产，也都在食堂里进行。炊事员、管理员的“红、勤、巧、俭”运动，以及社员各种学习生产的评比竞赛，也多在食堂里公布表扬。社员们的共产主义劳动热情日益高涨，人与人的关系大大改变，历史上久不和睦的杨、刘两姓，现在和睦了。现在人人心连心，户户亲如一家人，公共食堂不仅冲破了几千年的封建家长制，也克服了宗派情绪，使每颗心都紧密地连在一起，生活在温暖的大家庭里。
    这个大队的公共食堂是怎样办好的呢？
    一、实行政治挂帅、坚决树立贫农和下中农在食堂中的绝对领导优势。除全大队三十三个干部，一律在大食堂与社员群众一起吃饭，不断地听取群众意见外，大队副支书和一位委员专管食堂工作。同时，经常对社员进行爱食堂如家和公共食堂优越性的教育。并且清除了隐藏在炊管人员中的五个地富分子，调换了不称职的炊管人员，充实了党团骨干和贫农、下中农的积极分子。另外，还及时地打击地、富、反、坏分子对于食堂的破坏言行。
    二、认真贯彻执行了计划用粮、节约用粮、瞻前顾后、勤俭办食堂和富日子当穷日子过的原则。根据农活忙闲制定了吃粮计划，使食堂顿顿有干有稀，生活调剂的很好，细粮长年不断，麦后还能吃粗粮。对社员实行“依人定量，指标到户，集体保管，凭票就餐，节约归己”的办法，达到了吃饱、吃好、吃省、吃的干净卫生。
    三、大搞食堂家底生产，大量种植蔬菜。除食堂种了六十亩菜以外，大队还种南瓜、东瓜、笋瓜等四百六十亩（队种菜除保证食堂每人每天三斤菜外，多余部分支援城市，收入归队）；开荒种菜二千亩。预计可收一百二十万斤，自足还可支援城市六万余斤。食堂养猪三十八头，奶羊七十二头，鱼三万多尾（大的有六、七斤重），还有粉坊、豆腐坊、酱菜园等小型作坊。基本上达到了肉食、燃料、油、盐、酱、醋自给自足，实现了主副食并举，改善了社员生活。由于食堂有了雄厚的家底，社员们更加热爱食堂。社员歌唱着：“公共食堂好的很，家底生产真喜人，蔬菜满园吃不尽，猪、羊、鲤鱼群连群；柴、米、油、盐样样有，幸福生活扎下根。”
    四、实行管理民主化。食堂成立了社员代表会、食堂管理委员会（由大队和小队主要干部、妇女队长、管理员、炊事员代表、社员代表组成）。社员代表会，每半月召开一次会议，讨论食堂的用粮计划、家庭生产、财务收支、饭单等问题。并设有意见箱、鸣放栏、账目公布栏、表扬批评栏等，广泛吸收社员对食堂的意见和合理化建议，改进食堂工作。食堂账目每半月向社员公布一次，一月向社员大会汇报一次本月收支情况和下月生活安排。使每个社员了解食堂的家底。
    五、大搞炊具改革。这个食堂已经实现了切菜、做馍、和面、轧面条半机械化，吃水自流化，磨面动力化，锅灶吹风化。使用这些改良炊具比过去提高工效十倍以上。过去十二个人切菜一晌，还赶不上吃一顿包子，现在切菜机一个人操作够吃有余。吹风灶，不仅省煤（全年可节省三十六万余斤），而且做饭快、干净卫生。炊具改革前，一个炊事员平均只能做三十多个人的饭，现在能作六十多人的饭，还有休息学习和娱乐的时间。
    六、开展“红、勤、巧、俭”运动。在炊事管理人员中，采取了上课加强教育和工作中评比竞赛相结合的办法，开展“红、勤、巧、俭”运动。炊事管理人员隔一天上一次课，学习政治、业务和文化，并且定期进行评比表扬。这就大大鼓舞了炊事、管理人员的干劲。他们提出保证做到使社员人人满意，做到两不见，即听不见社员说伙食不好，看不见炊管人员态度不好。
    杨楼大队在办食堂工作方面，虽已经取得了显著的成绩，但是，也还存在着一些缺点，需要鼓足更大的干劲，把食堂办得更好。
    以上发言有不妥之处，请各位代表指正。
