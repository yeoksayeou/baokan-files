    Spring City, Flowers Everywhere
    Jiang Zhi Shui
    As we walked on the streets of Tianjin, the March wind felt so warm and pleasant. After stepping into the streets and alleys and witnessing the changes brought about by the residents' efforts to arrange their economic lives, a scene of vibrant spring life unfolded before us.

    The spring breeze swept through the alleys, life became vibrant, and people's hearts were filled with the spirit of spring...

    Walking through the alleys, every household had bright red double happiness characters pasted on their doors, the ink still wet. People said these were put up recently when the street established the public canteen. An elderly lady, an activist in the street, said: "Since liberation, I don't know how many times I've pasted these happiness characters. Setting up a public canteen is also a happy occasion. On the day the canteen was established, we all wore a red velvet flower on our chests, greeting the neighbors who came to eat. That day, the street store brought us fresh vegetables and red bean curd sheets, and we had a bowl of 'opening happiness' noodles. The neighbors who came to eat congratulated each other upon entering the canteen. The housewives would say: 'Auntie, I'm finally liberated!' or 'Sister-in-law, we've finally made it through!' Even if someone kowtowed three times to me, I wouldn't go back to my little stove!"

    A male employee working at the post office in Jinghua West Lane on Guangfu Road chimed in eagerly, "Don't just listen to the women! This time, even I'm liberated!" It turned out that he had a chronically ill wife at home. In the past, he had to cook every day after getting off work, and couldn't even attend the work unit's study sessions and meetings. Now? The cooks at the public canteen deliver three meals a day to his wife's home. No wonder he insisted on speaking up.

    We had lunch at the "Plaza" public canteen near Guangfu Road. That day, the lunch menu included spinach with bean curd sheets, braised gluten, stewed fish, and staple foods such as steamed rolls, corn bread, and rice. The most expensive dish was only fifteen cents a plate. To our right, eating next to us, was a housewife working in the street's paper mounting workshop. To our left were two young girls attending elementary school, the older one no more than ten years old, the younger one only seven or eight. We asked them, "Where are your father and mother?" They replied, "They've both gone to work." "Where did you eat in the past?" "Us? We cooked ourselves!" "Could you do it well?" "Not well. We always ate burnt food, sometimes half-cooked. It wasted time on homework, and we couldn't go out to play. It was such a hassle, and we could easily get burned. We didn't like cooking at all!" The people eating at the table all laughed. The young woman who had just stepped out of the home then began to talk about her changes, praising the public canteen and expressing her gratitude to the Party. Occasionally, others would chime in to help her say a few words, making the canteen seem particularly lively. Amidst the laughter, I looked up and saw a big-character poster written by residents on the wall. It read:

    Plaza Canteen's food is fragrant,
    Diverse and better than at home,
    Liberating household labor,
    Happy life, thanks to the Party.

    In the alleys of Nanmen West Street, we also saw many newly established large-scale production workshops, including a brush factory, a small hardware parts manufacturing plant, and a handlebar assembly workshop, almost all composed of fifty or sixty, or even a hundred, housewives. We saw that in the handlebar assembly workshop, although the parts were numerous and the technology very complex, their work was exceptionally skilled. From assembly to packaging, boxing, and printing, all were completed by these housewives. In the courtyard, we saw a large batch of finished products assembled by them, boxed, and ready for shipment abroad. In this workshop and other workshops processing for factories, we heard them say more than once that some housewives, after being liberated from the family, gradually improved their ideological awareness and learned technology quickly. Some people's work efficiency had already exceeded that of full-time workers doing the same job.

    Now they work six hours a day, with an additional two hours for studying politics and culture. In almost every workshop, we saw blackboards hanging on the walls, with neat characters just learned by the housewives. At noon, after eating in the street's public canteen, everyone would rest, sometimes engaging in small-scale recreational activities or reading newspapers. The tremendous changes in life have allowed them to enjoy rights they could not have obtained in the past. No wonder their enthusiasm for production is growing, and their horizons are widening.

    In a not-so-long alley, we saw the elderly woman from the "Alley's All-Purpose Service Station" distributing grain coupons to workers whose couples had gone to work. Others were filling thermos bottles with hot water for the workers at the hot water station. When asked why they were doing this, their answers were simple and touching: "Why? They've all gone to work, and there's no one at home!" When asked what services they offered, they said: "Whatever they need done, we do it all!"

    This alley also has a consignment shop, a sewing group, a laundry group, a barbershop, an epidemic prevention station, a library, a nursery, a children's playground, a shoe stitching group, and a repair station. In the repair station, a middle-aged housewife, who had only started working in production for two months, was skillfully replacing and mending pot bottoms for residents, and another woman was welding iron kettles... The children in the alley's nursery were sleeping peacefully in their small beds. From their serene little faces, one could almost feel how relieved their parents must be and how well the nannies were taking care of them. All the alley's nannies, repair workers, epidemic prevention workers, barbers, and shoe stitchers are just housewives who have mastered the skills after short-term training. How clever and skillful they are! Only at this time does their wisdom shine.

    The spiritual outlook of the alley's residents has also changed. Many neighbors who hadn't spoken or gotten along for many years are now talking to each other and getting along well due to collective living! Two families are even planning to tear down the brick wall separating their two small courtyards and combine them into one large courtyard.

    In an alley's public canteen, we saw a woman in her thirties who had come to the canteen as a cook for the first time the day before. The original cook had fallen ill. As soon as she heard about it, she proactively ran over to help. When she saw us, she happily told us that she had been wiping plates and washing dishes in a restaurant with her father, who was a chef, since she was a child, and had therefore learned a set of cooking skills. Whether it was frying, stir-frying, stewing, or deep-frying, she could handle it, and she could cook up to hundreds of different dishes. She said, "This time, I'm going to make some new dishes for the people in our canteen to try."

    There are also some so-called "dead corners" that have now been revived. In Xing'an Street's Xingsheng Alley, we heard more than one such touching story. A couple lived upstairs, and they argued about who should take out the dirt, so neither of them did it. As a result, the dirt piled up on the balcony, burying past the balcony railing. This time, after the alley vigorously arranged economic life, the neighbors ran upstairs and carried away more than a dozen boxes of dirt, weighing over a thousand pounds, moving the couple so much that they automatically examined their faults and repeatedly expressed to their neighbors that they would never argue again!

    There was also an old man in the alley who used to call the street activists "worn-out shoes," meaning that these activists wore out their shoes for the masses but no one took care of their meals. As it happened, a few days ago, due to careless eating, she developed acute gastroenteritis. Her daughter and son-in-law had both gone to work, and there were only two four- or five-year-old children at home. She was in so much pain that she was covered in sweat and couldn't move. What could she do? As a result, the neighbors arrived, one group went to the hospital to bring the doctor to her, and another group sent a message and made a phone call to her daughter. Afterwards, her daughter and son-in-law expressed that they would work harder in their work positions to repay the neighbors' care. After coming out of the hospital, the elderly woman's diet and daily life were also taken care of by her neighbors. Now she is completely well. When she sees the activists, she no longer calls them "worn-out shoes," and she says with emotion, "I also want to participate in their work. Now I only take care of my daughter's two children. I still have the ability to help others. Let me take care of more children for the neighbors."

    The spring breeze in the alleys is blowing more and more intensely. Wherever we go, the people there seem so young and so full of joy. When we praised the changes in the lives of housewives, people smiled and replied, "We are not satisfied yet! This is just the beginning. The Party has arranged good days for us ahead!"

    Walking through the streets and alleys of Tianjin, you will feel how rich and moving the spring in life is, full of vitality and blossoming with brilliant flowers of life everywhere. This is just an ordinary day in the first spring of the sixties; this is just a few fragmented little scenes taken in the swaying spring breeze. But what an extraordinary spring this is. On such a sunny and pleasant day, I wonder how many cities are also bathed in this spring breeze, and how many streets and alleys are undergoing brand new changes, everywhere is a dazzling and brilliant spring scene.

    People are enthusiastically cheering for the first spring of the sixties, and people are singing praises to this eternal spring on earth!

    春城无处不飞花
    江之水
    我们走在天津的街道上，3月的风吹得人们感到那么暖和、畅快。我们走进街道里巷以后，看到居民们大搞安排经济生活以后的变化，在我们面前出现了一片生活的春光。
    春风吹遍了里巷，生活沸腾起来了，人们的心头也都春意充盈……。
    走过里巷，家家户户门前都贴着颜色鲜红、墨迹未干的双喜字。人们说，这是不久以前街道成立公共食堂时贴的。一位是街道积极分子的老大娘说：打解放后，不知我贴了多少次喜字了。办公共食堂也是办喜事，成立食堂的那一天，我们的胸前都插了一朵红绒花，招呼着来吃饭的邻居们。那一天，街道商店给我们送来新鲜的菜、红粉皮，我们吃了一顿开门喜的捞面。来吃饭的邻居们，进食堂就彼此道喜，家庭妇女们见面不是说：大婶，我这回可解放了；就是说：嫂子，咱们算熬出来了！谁再给我磕三个响头，我也不上我那小锅台啦！
    光复道荆华西里有个在邮局工作的男职工也抢着说，别尽听你们妇女的了，这一回可连我也解放了。原来他家里有个长期生病的妻子，过去他天天下班回来得做饭，连机关的学习和开会都不能参加。现在呢？公共食堂的炊事员把一天三餐饭都给他妻子送到家里去，怪不得他非要抢着说说不可呢。
    我们在光复道附近的“广场”公共食堂里吃了一顿午饭。这一天午餐有菠菜烩粉皮、烧面巾、熬鱼，主食有花卷、窝头、米饭。最贵的菜也只有一角五分钱一盘。在右边挨着我们吃饭的是一个在街道裱纸车间做活的家庭妇女；在我们左边吃饭的是两个在小学读书的小姑娘，大的不过十岁，小的只有七、八岁。我们问她俩：“爸爸、妈妈呢？”她们回答：“都上班去了。”“你们过去在哪里吃饭？”“我们吗？自己做！”“会吗？”“做不好，我们老吃烧焦了的糊饭，有时还吃半生不熟的。又耽误功课，又不能去玩，真费事，还容易烫着，我们才不愿意做饭呢！”说得桌旁吃饭的人们都笑起来了。那位刚刚走出家庭的年青妇女，又接着跟我们扯起她的变化，说了不少赞美公共食堂和感激党的话。间或也有别人插进来帮她说上几句，一时显得这食堂分外热闹。在人们嘻笑声中，我抬头看到墙上一张居民写的大字报，上面是：
    广场食堂饭菜香，
    多种多样比家强，
    解放家庭劳动力，
    美满生活感谢党。
    在南门西大街的里巷里，我们还看到许多新成立的大型的生产车间，有制刷场，小五金零件制造场，车把装配车间等，差不多都是由五六十名，甚至上百个家庭妇女组成的。我们看到车把装配车间，虽然零件繁多，技术非常复杂，但是她们的工作都分外熟练。从装配到包装、打箱、印字，全部由这些家庭妇女们完成。在院子里，我们就看到由她们装好箱待运国外的大批成品。在这个车间和其他为工厂加工的车间里，我们不止一次地听到她们介绍说，有的家庭妇女，由于从家庭解放出来以后，思想觉悟逐渐提高，学习技术很快，有的人的工作效率已经超过做同样工作的在职工人了。
    现在她们每天工作六小时，另外两小时用来学习政治、文化。差不多在每个车间里，我们都看到墙上挂着黑板，上面有家庭妇女们刚刚学会写的工整的字。中午，她们在街道公共食堂用过饭以后，大家就休息，有时还展开小型文娱活动，或是读报。生活的巨变，使她们享受到过去不能得到的这些权利，难怪她们生产的劲头愈来愈大，眼界也愈来愈宽了。
    在一条不算很长的里巷里，我们看到“里巷万能服务站”的老大娘，正给夫妇出去上班的职工领粮票。还有的在开水站给职工灌暖水瓶。问起她们为什么要这样做时，回答的语言是朴素而动人的：“为什么？他们都上班了，家里没有人哪！”问起都有哪些服务项目时，她们就说：“只要他们需要办的事，什么都干！”
    这条里巷还有代销店、缝纫组、洗衣组、理发室、防疫站、图书室、托儿所、儿童乐园、鞝鞋组、修配站。在修配站里，一个刚刚走向生产不过两个月的中年家庭妇女，正熟练地给居民换补锅底，还有一个妇女在焊铁壶……。里巷托儿所里的孩子们正安详地睡在小床里，从他们一个个恬静的小脸上，仿佛可以感觉到他们的父母该多么放心和阿姨们照管得有多好。所有里巷的阿姨们、修配工人、防疫员、理发员、鞝鞋的人们，都不过是经过短期训练就掌握了技术的家庭妇女。她们有多么聪明灵巧呀，也只有在这个时候，她们的智慧才闪耀出光辉。
    里巷居民的精神面貌也变了。许多过去多年不讲话、不和睦的邻居，现在由于集体生活的关系，大家讲话了，和睦了！有两家还准备把隔成两个小院的砖墙推倒，合成一个大院。
    在一个里巷的公共食堂里，我们看到一个三十多岁的妇女，她是头一天来食堂当炊事员的。原来的炊事员得了病，她一听说，就主动地跑来帮忙了。她见到我们的面就高兴地跟我们说，她从小跟着自己当厨师的父亲在饭庄里擦盘洗碗，因此也学会了一套做菜的手艺。不管煎炒烹炸，她都能动得了手，而且做的菜的样数足有上百种。她说，这一次我可要给我们食堂的人们做几样新鲜菜尝尝了。
    还有一些过去所谓的“死角”，现在也复活了。我们在兴安街幸生胡同里就听到过不止一件这样动人的故事。有一对夫妇住在楼上，为了下楼倒脏土的事，彼此呕气谁都不去倒，结果脏土堆积在阳台上，埋过了阳台的栏杆。这一次，胡同里大搞安排经济生活以后，邻居们跑上去给他们夫妇抬走了足有一千几百斤重的十几箱脏土，感动得夫妇俩互相自动检讨，并一再向邻居们表示，今后绝不呕气了！
    胡同里还有个老人，过去见到街道积极分子就喊“跑破鞋”，意思是说这些积极分子为群众跑破了鞋也没有人管饭吃。可巧，前几天由于她饮食不慎，得了急性肠胃炎。她的女儿、女婿都去上班了，家里只有两个四、五岁的小孩子。她肚痛得混身是汗，动也动不得，这可怎么办呢？结果邻居们闻风而至，一面到医院把医生给她请来，一面派人给她女儿送口信、打电话。事后她女儿、女婿表示一定要在工作岗位上加倍努力来报答邻居们的关心。从医院出来以后，这位老人的饮食起居也都有邻居照顾。现在她已经完全好了，见了积极分子的面再也不喊“跑破鞋”了，而且她感动地说，我也要参加他们的工作，我现在只看管自己女儿的两个小孩，我还有能力帮助别人，让我给邻居们多照管几个孩子吧。
    里巷的春风正愈刮愈炽烈。我们走到哪里，那里的人们都显得那么年青，那么喜气洋溢。我们赞扬家庭妇女们的生活变化时，人们都笑着回答说，我们可并不满足呢！这才是个开始呀，党给我们安排的好日子在后头哩！
    在天津的街道里巷里走走，你会感觉到生活里的春天是多么丰富动人，到处充满了生机，到处开放出生活的灿烂的花朵。这是六十年代第一个春天里普通的一日；这里只不过是在春风荡漾中摄取下来的几个零碎的小镜头。但是，这又是一个多么不平凡的春天。在这样风和日丽的日子里，不知有多少城市也沐浴在这春风之中，不知有多少街道里巷正发生着崭新的变化，到处是一片耀眼的灿烂的春光。
    人们热烈地欢呼着六十年代的第一个春天，人们歌颂着这永远也不消逝的人间的春天！
