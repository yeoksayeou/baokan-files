Establish More Li Nongqin-Style Pace-Setters
Urumqi July 1st Cotton Textile Factory Promotes the Style of Advanced Helping the Backward

    (Our report) The Urumqi July 1st Cotton Textile Factory in Xinjiang, in the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, established "Li Nongqin-style" pace-setters and greatly promoted the communist style of the advanced helping the backward, significantly improving the technical level of workers.

    The "Learn from Li Nongqin" movement has developed from individuals helping individuals to collectives helping collectives, and from technical assistance to ideological assistance. A new atmosphere of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping prevails throughout the factory, quickly transforming the operating skills of a few advanced producers into the common production level of the entire factory. This movement is also developing towards the entire city and region, greatly promoting the communist style throughout the city and region.

    In the past six months, the July 1st Cotton Textile Factory has established one hundred and fourteen advanced pace-setters who enthusiastically help the backward, and more than nine hundred advanced individuals and seventy-nine advanced collectives have emerged. Furthermore, more than four hundred and forty people and twenty-five collectives have caught up with the advanced level. The overall production level of the factory has been significantly improved. The tending capacity of roving frame operators has increased by an average of 30% in the past two months. The factory has completed its production plans every month, and the cotton and yarn consumption of several major products have reached advanced national standards.

    The mass movement of the advanced helping the backward in the July 1st Cotton Textile Factory is a development of the "Learn from Li Nongqin" movement among all the factory's employees. Li Nongqin, an advanced producer who attended the National Conference of Heroes, is a roving frame operator in the fine spinning workshop of the factory's first branch. She humbly learned and diligently studied technology, creating a relatively advanced set of operating methods. During operation, her movements were nimble and efficient, with high efficiency and good quality. Last year, she made a total of sixty-four technical innovation proposals, increasing production. Compared with ordinary roving frame operators, she saved an average of nearly two pounds of raw cotton per day, making her a famous "clever weaver" in the factory. In particular, under the cultivation and assistance of the Party, she clearly established the idea that "it's not good if one person is good, it's good if everyone is good," and voluntarily left the group that had maintained advanced collective status for six consecutive years to tend difficult machines in other shifts and groups. She tried her best to impart her skills and experience to comrades who needed help without reservation. When others were not welcoming, she continued to help with unabated enthusiasm, improving the technical level of the collective, establishing a red flag of communist thought, and enabling the seeds of advanced producers to quickly take root, blossom, and bear fruit among the masses.

    The July 1st Cotton Textile Factory is a modern enterprise in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Because new workers who entered the factory after the autumn of 1958 accounted for more than 80% of the total number of workers, the level of production technology was not high. There was a large gap in technical level between new and old workers. For example, old workers could tend 600, 800, or even 1,200 spindles, while new workers could only tend 200 spindles. A few old workers scored above 95 points when measuring operating methods, while the average for the entire workshop was only 68 points. How to quickly change the situation of most workers having a low level of technical skill became the key to the factory's continued leap forward in production.

    Based on the experience of carrying out mass movements during the two years of the Great Leap Forward, the Party Committee of the July 1st Cotton Textile Factory, starting in the second half of last year, launched an advanced-helping-the-backward movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution throughout the factory. While summarizing and promoting Li Nongqin's advanced operating methods, it emphasized her valuable communist thought of trying her best to help others, educated all employees, and launched a "Learn from Li Nongqin, catch up with Li Nongqin, and realize a great leap forward in the whole factory" movement. It also cultivated a group of "Li Nongqin-style" pace-setters who had good ideology, good production, good task completion, and good help to others. It vigorously promoted technical assistance among workers of the same type and ideological assistance among workers of different types, expanding the scope of assistance from the advanced to the backward from purely technical assistance to comprehensive communist-style assistance including technology and ideology, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers to consciously learn, compare, catch up, and help, and improving their collective consciousness, laying a solid ideological foundation for mass production technology innovation and technical revolution.

    In the factory-wide movement of advanced helping the backward from technology to ideology and from individuals to collectives, the technical level and ideological awareness of workers have undergone tremendous changes, and a new atmosphere of everyone comparing, learning, catching up, and helping has emerged. The factory has already produced one hundred and fourteen "Li Nongqin-style" pace-setters. For example, under the guidance of Li Nongqin, new worker Zhao Guilan reduced the time for changing six rovings from more than 90 seconds to more than 70 seconds, catching up with and surpassing Li Nongqin and other old workers. Moreover, she was able to proactively assist comrades such as Wang Xiuchuan, who often failed to complete their production plans, to overfulfill their plans. Wang Yufeng, the leader of the decoration group in the printing and dyeing branch, was unwilling to handle substandard cloth in the past, often assigning the substandard cloth to other comrades in the group. As a result, the entire group was not united, and tasks were often not completed. During the "Learn from Li Nongqin" movement, Wang Yufeng completely changed. Not only did she compete to handle substandard cloth, but she also actively helped others complete their tasks. As a result, the entire group completed their tasks very well. In the fine spinning workshop of the first branch, where new workers account for more than 90%, one hundred and sixteen workers have reached an advanced level through hard work. Recently, when measuring operating methods, the entire workshop has increased sharply from 68 points before June last year to more than 90 points. The least skilled new workers can tend 600 spindles, and the best can tend 1,200 spindles, on par with the advanced skilled workers among the old workers.

    Due to the in-depth development of the mass movement of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping, in October last year, C class in the fine spinning workshop of the first branch was in danger of failing to complete its monthly plan. Workers from A and B classes selected eight of their best operators to support C class and helped them complete their plan. At the beginning of January this year, the roving count of A and B classes was uneven, so C class specifically summarized its experience in reducing the unevenness of the count and imparted it to A and B classes. In the large-scale technical innovation in the printing and dyeing workshop of the printing and dyeing branch, workers in B class first experimented with manufacturing automatic acid addition equipment. When they learned that workers in C class were also conducting the same experiment, they unconditionally sent the part of the equipment they had manufactured and the materials they had prepared to C class to support the workers in C class in completing the experiment. In supporting fraternal units to complete their production plans, mutual support in manpower and electricity has become a common practice among workshops and branches, ensuring that the factory's production plans for the entire year of last year and January of this year were completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target.

    树立更多李弄琴式标兵
    乌鲁木齐七一棉纺织厂大兴先进帮后进之风
    本报讯　新疆乌鲁木齐七一棉纺织厂，在技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中，树立“李弄琴式”标兵，大兴先进帮助后进的共产主义风格，显著地提高了工人技术水平。
  “学习李弄琴”运动，已经从个人帮助个人，发展到集体帮助集体，从技术上的帮助，发展到思想上的帮助，比、学、赶、帮的新风气遍及全厂，使原来少数先进生产者的操作技术，很快地变成全厂普遍的生产水平，这个运动还在向全市、全区发展，在全市、全区大兴共产主义的风格。
    近半年来，七一棉纺织厂树立了热心帮助后进的先进标兵一百一十四名，涌现了九百多名先进个人和七十九个先进集体，并且有四百四十多人和二十五个集体赶上了先进水平，全厂的生产水平得到显著的提高，运转工人的看台能力在今年两个月中就平均提高了30％，全厂月月完成生产计划，几种主要产品的用棉、用纱都达到全国的先进指标。
    七一棉纺织厂先进帮助后进的群众运动，是全厂职工展开“学习李弄琴”运动的发展。出席全国群英会的先进生产者李弄琴，是这个厂一分厂精纺车间挡车女工，她虚心学习和刻苦钻研技术，创造了一套比较先进的操作法。她在操作时，动作灵活轻巧，效率高，质量好。去年她一共提了六十四件技术革新建议，提高了生产，和一般挡车女工比较，她每天平均节约原棉将近两磅，是全厂著名的“巧织女”。特别是她在党的培养和帮助下，明确树立了“一个人好不算好，大家好才是好”的思想，自愿离开一连六年保持先进集体的小组，到别的班、组去挡难挡的车，千方百计地把自己的技术和经验，毫无保留地传授给需要帮助的同志，碰到别人不欢迎的时候，仍不灰心地满腔热情地继续帮助，提高了集体的技术水平，树立了共产主义思想红旗，使先进生产者的种子在群众中迅速生根、开花和结果。
    七一棉纺织厂是新疆维吾尔自治区一所现代化企业，由于1958年秋天以后入厂的新工人占了全部工人总数的80％以上，生产技术水平不高。新工人和老工人之间，技术水平相差很大。如老工人可以挡六百锭、八百锭甚至一千二百锭，新工人只能挡二百锭。少数老工人测定操作法时达到九十五分以上，而全车间平均只达到六十八分。如何迅速改变大部分工人技术水平不高的情况，就成为全厂生产持续跃进的关键。
    七一棉纺织厂党委根据两年跃进中大搞群众运动的经验，从去年下半年开始，在全厂展开了一个以技术革新和技术革命为中心的先进帮后进运动，在总结并推广李弄琴先进操作法的同时，更强调她千方百计帮助别人的可贵的共产主义思想，对全体职工进行教育，开展“学李弄琴，赶李弄琴，实现全厂大跃进”运动。并且培养了一批思想好、生产好、完成任务好和帮助别人好的“李弄琴式”标兵，大力提倡同工种帮技术，不同工种帮思想，使先进对后进的帮助从单纯技术帮助的范围，扩大成为包括技术、思想的全面的共产主义同志式的帮助，大大地激发了广大职工自觉地学、比、赶、帮的热情，提高了集体主义的觉悟，为群众性的生产技术革新和技术革命打下了坚实的思想基础。
    在全厂范围的从技术到思想、从个人到集体的先进帮后进的运动中，职工的技术水平和思想觉悟都起了巨大的变化，出现了人人比、学、赶、帮的新风气。全厂已经涌现了一百一十四名“李弄琴式”标兵。如新工人赵桂兰在李弄琴的帮助下，一次换六个粗纱的时间从九十多秒降低到七十多秒，赶上并且超过了李弄琴和其他老工人，而且还能主动帮助经常完不成生产计划的王秀传等同志超额完成计划。印染分厂装璜小组长王毓凤，过去不愿意码次布，常常把次布分配给组里其他同志去码，结果全组闹不团结，任务也经常完不成。在“学习李弄琴”运动中，王毓凤彻底转变了，不但争先码次布，还积极帮助别人完成任务，结果全组任务完成得很好。新工人占90％以上的一分厂精纺车间，已经有一百一十六名工人，经过努力由落后达到了先进水平，最近测定操作法时，全车间已经从去年6月以前的六十八分，猛增到九十分以上。技术最差的新工人都能挡六百纱锭，最好的已能挡一千二百纱锭，和老工人中的先进能手不相上下。
    由于比、学、赶、帮的群众运动深入开展，去年10月，一分厂精纺车间丙班有完不成月计划的危险，甲、乙两班工人就选派出最好的八名操作能手去支援，帮助丙班工人完成了计划。今年1月初，甲、乙两班的粗纱支数不匀，丙班就专门总结了自己降低支数不匀率的经验，传授给甲、乙两班。印染分厂印染车间在大搞技术革新中，乙班工人首先试验制造自动加酸设备，当他们知道丙班工人也正进行同样的试验时，就把自己制造好的部分设备和准备好的材料，无条件地送给丙班，支援丙班工人完成试验。各车间、各分厂在支援兄弟单位完成生产计划时，互相支援人力、电力已经成为一种风气，保证了全厂去年全年和今年1月份的生产计划都提前超额完成。
