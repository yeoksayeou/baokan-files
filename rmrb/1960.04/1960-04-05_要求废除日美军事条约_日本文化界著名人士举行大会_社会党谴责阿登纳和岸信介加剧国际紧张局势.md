Xinhua News Agency, April 4th, Tokyo Dispatch: Approximately one thousand prominent figures from Japanese cultural circles held a rally in Tokyo today, demanding that the Diet abolish the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and dispatched representatives to the Diet to petition. This rally was jointly convened by the "Security Treaty Critique Society" and the Japan-China Cultural Relations Roundtable.

The rally adopted a statement saying that the new "Security Treaty" will push Japan onto a new path of war. The statement called on the Japanese people to work hard to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new "Security Treaty."

Commentator Kenzo Nakajima, in his speech, recalled the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy during World War II, pointing out that the policies implemented by the reactionaries of the past and present have obvious similarities. This similarity is made even more prominent by Kishi Nobusuke's invitation to the well-known anti-communist figure Adenauer to visit Japan. He called on the young and old generations in Japan to take joint action against the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

Religious figures also criticized the new "Security Treaty" at the meeting. The famous monk, Takahiro Okawauchi, said that those who are trying to get the Diet to approve the new "Security Treaty" lack self-reproach for their past crimes of aggression against China and other Asian countries, and they have signed a new treaty of aggression, wanting to invade Asian countries again.

Also speaking at the rally were writer Tatsuzo Ishikawa, painter Setsu Asakura, and actress Yuko Mochizuki. They exposed the reactionary essence of the new "Security Treaty."

The rally read out congratulatory telegrams from the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. At this time, the venue erupted with storm-like applause.

After the rally, the participants demonstrated in an orderly manner in front of the Diet.

Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd, Tokyo Dispatch: Approximately twenty prominent figures from Japanese cultural circles collected signatures today in front of Yurakucho Station in the central area of Tokyo to oppose the Diet's ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." These cultural figures are all members of the "Security Treaty Critique Society," including famous painters, playwrights, Christian pastors, and Buddhist priests.

Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japan Socialist Party issued a statement on the 1st, strongly condemning the joint communique issued by Adenauer and Kishi Nobusuke. The statement pointed out that the joint communique means an anti-communist alliance between Japan and West Germany, which will further strengthen their anti-communist policies. This will only intensify international tensions.

The statement also condemned Adenauer's anti-communist speech in the Japanese Diet on March 31. The statement said that Adenauer's words "remind people of the unpleasant matter of the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo axis during the war." The statement also said that the Socialist Party is "particularly uneasy" about Adenauer's mention of rearmament.

The Socialist Party also decided to demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government disclose the true content of the talks with Adenauer.

    要求废除日美军事条约
    日本文化界著名人士举行大会
    社会党谴责阿登纳和岸信介加剧国际紧张局势
    据新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本文化界著名人士约一千人今天在东京举行大会，要求国会废除新日美“安全条约”，并且派代表前往国会请愿。这次大会是由“安全条约批判会”和日中文化关系恳谈会联合召开的。
    大会通过声明说，新“安全条约”将把日本推上新的战争道路。声明呼吁日本人民努力阻止国会批准新“安全条约”。
    评论家中岛健藏在会上追述第二次大战中的日、德、意三国同盟时指出，过去的和现今的反动派所执行的政策有着明显的相似之处。这种相似之处由于岸信介邀请著名的反共人物阿登纳访问日本而显得更加突出。他要求日本年青一代和年老一代共同行动起来反对国会批准新“安全条约”。
    宗教界人士也在会上批评了新“安全条约”。著名和尚大河内隆弘说，那些力图使国会批准新“安全条约”的人对自己过去侵略中国和其它亚洲国家的罪行缺乏自责，他们又签订了新的侵略条约，想再次侵略亚洲国家。
    在大会上讲话的还有作家石川达三、画家朝仓摄、女演员望月优子。他们揭露了新“安全条约”的反动本质。
    大会宣读了中国人民对外文化协会和中国文学艺术界联合会的贺电。这时，会场上响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    参加大会的人在会后秩序井然地到国会前示威。
    据新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本文化界著名人士约二十名今天在东京市中心区的有乐町车站前面征集反对国会批准新日美“安全条约”的签名。这些文化界人士都是“安全条约批判会”的会员，其中有著名画家、剧作家、基督教牧师和佛教法师等。
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本社会党1日发表声明，强烈谴责阿登纳和岸信介发表的联合公报。声明指出，联合公报意味着日本和西德之间的反共联盟，将使日本和西德进一步加强它们的反共政策。这只会加剧国际紧张局势。
    声明还谴责阿登纳3月31日在日本国会发表的反共演说。声明说，阿登纳的话“使人们想起战时的柏林—罗马—东京轴心这件不愉快的事”。声明还说，社会党人对阿登纳提到重新武装感到“特别不安”。
    社会党还决定要求岸信介政府公开同阿登纳会谈的真实内容。
