The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Thrives in Both Population and Wealth
Speech by Representative Ma Yuhai

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the reports of the three Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and guided by the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" and the three red banners of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune, the Hui and Han people of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have achieved great victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction. The socialist consciousness of the Hui and Han people has been unprecedentedly enhanced, the unity and cooperation between nationalities have been unprecedentedly consolidated, and economic and cultural construction has advanced by leaps and bounds. In two years, industrial output value has increased more than fourfold; agricultural output value has increased by 70%, and the number of sheep has increased by 55%; the number of students in primary and secondary schools has doubled. People's lives have improved significantly, and the total retail sales of social commodities have increased by more than 60%. The population of the entire region has increased by a quarter. The Hui and Han people describe the autonomous region as "thriving in both population and wealth." Since this spring, we have achieved a flying start victory on all fronts, laying the foundation for a new leap forward in socialist construction this year. All of this shows that Ningxia has undergone major changes.

The Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in the Ningxia area is the result of following Chairman Mao's theory of continuous revolution and the stages of revolutionary development, constantly resolving the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base, and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Hui people of Ningxia have undergone an extremely profound transformation and progress in the process of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, and have embarked on a new stage of development.

In areas where peaceful land reform was implemented, because the task of anti-feudalism had not yet been completed, the feudal forces wearing the cloak of religion oppressed and exploited the Hui people, which was a major obstacle to the development and progress of the Hui people. The Hui people, with greatly enhanced socialist consciousness, and in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, felt very strongly that without eliminating the remaining class oppression within the nation and without removing ideological shackles, it would be impossible to carry out socialist construction at high speed. Under the leadership and support of the Party, the Hui people waged a resolute struggle against the remaining feudal forces disguised as religion, exposed bad people and bad deeds, abolished the feudal oppression and feudal exploitation system, got rid of feudal shackles, and liberated the productive forces. The Hui women, who had been subjected to feudal shackles for a long time, were liberated. They got rid of household chores, enthusiastically walked out of their homes, took off their headscarves, actively participated in industrial and agricultural production, political and cultural learning, and social activities, and, together with the Han women, became a vital force in socialist construction. The movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries and make up for missed lessons in the Guyuan area cracked down on counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements in religious disguise, and social order was unprecedentedly stable. The victory in the struggle against the remaining feudal forces greatly liberated the minds of the Hui masses, making them more confident in their own strength and more eager to develop and progress. Encouraged and promoted by the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, they consciously reformed customs that were unfavorable to the development of production, broke superstitions, established a brand-new style, and were full of energy and enthusiasm. The further liberation and rapid progress of the Hui people has added strength to the socialist construction of the entire region, effectively promoted the great mass movement of the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune, and accelerated the advance of the socialist cause.

The victory of the socialist revolution and the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, and the further liberation of the Hui people, have raised the class consciousness of the Hui and Han people in Ningxia, especially the Hui masses, and made them more profoundly realize the complete unity of the interests of the working people of all ethnic groups. The ethnic divisions and discrimination created by the reactionary ruling class in history have been replaced by socialist ethnic relations that do not distinguish between nationalities, are close and seamless, and cooperate closely. People no longer use nationality as the criterion for distinguishing each other, but use class as the criterion for judgment and analysis. The flesh-and-blood relationship between working people and the sincere friendship of the class have become the most important content of mutual relations. The great people's commune has further consolidated and developed the relationship of consistent interests and consistent steps between the working people from an organizational point of view. The broad masses of Hui and Han people work, study, and live together on all fronts, fighting together to build socialism. The in-depth development of the socialist revolution and the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction have made the Hui and Han people not only more consistent in their thinking and actions, but also closer in their economic and cultural levels. With the continuous advancement of the socialist cause, all negative factors hindering national progress and national unity will inevitably be quickly overcome, and the Hui and Han people will inevitably become closer, and commonality will definitely develop more and more. This is the inevitable trend of historical development, and it is also the long-term aspiration and expectation of the Hui and Han people of Ningxia. We should warmly welcome and actively promote this, so that this progressive trend in national relations can quickly develop to a higher stage.

The increasingly consolidated and strengthened cooperative relationship between the Hui and Han people provides the most powerful guarantee for socialist construction in the Ningxia area, and a situation of comprehensive and continuous Great Leap Forward has emerged. The Hui and Han people have united as one and unswervingly embarked on the socialist road of common prosperity, and cherish the socialist great unity between each other even more. They resolutely and proactively jointly smashed all adverse currents that endanger socialism and split national unity.

In order to further consolidate the socialist national unity, we have unremittingly opposed bourgeois nationalism, especially local nationalism. Local nationalism is a reflection of bourgeois ideology on national issues. It represents the struggle and resistance of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes among ethnic minorities in the face of the continuous victory of the socialist revolution. Therefore, our struggle against local nationalism has a certain long-term nature. According to the situation in Ningxia, the main manifestations of local nationalist ideology at present are: being conservative and xenophobic in national relations, adhering to or even creating national boundaries and national differences. In economic construction, violating the principle of overall planning, one-sidedly emphasizing the needs of ethnic minority areas regardless of actual conditions. In culture, maintaining backwardness, unwilling or even hindering the masses from reforming outdated customs. People with local nationalist ideology always regard themselves as defenders of national interests, and distort the national policies of the Party and the state, painstakingly splitting national unity and opposing socialism. Therefore, resolutely opposing local nationalism is an important link in correctly implementing the Party's national policies, consolidating national unity, safeguarding the unification of the motherland, promoting the progress of ethnic minorities, and defending the socialist cause. Our struggle against local nationalism is an important component of the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads in ethnic minority areas. This struggle, like the situation of the entire class struggle, is undulating. In Ningxia, after the all-people rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, and after the socialist and communist education movement, local nationalism has been severely hit, and its market for activities has been greatly reduced. However, since class struggle still exists, we cannot relax our struggle against local nationalist ideology. We must continuously strengthen socialist and communist education for the people, vigorously improve the people's level of awareness, resolutely criticize and overcome local nationalist ideology, and thoroughly expose and criticize this trend of thought as soon as it rears its head.

After more than two years of the Great Leap Forward, the Ningxia area has already gained a very good start in promoting national integration and solving national problems. This is a great victory for the Party's general line for building socialism and its national policy. In the future, we are determined to unite the Hui and Han people better under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, hold high the banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune even higher, fully mobilize and give play to the strength of the Hui and Han people, and strive to accelerate socialist construction in the Ningxia area and to build the socialist family of the motherland!

    宁夏回族自治区人财两旺
    马玉槐代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理的报告和人大常务委员会的工作报告。
    宁夏回族自治区的回汉人民，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线和大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的指引下，在全国人民的热情支援下，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。回汉人民的社会主义觉悟空前提高，民族间的团结协作关系空前巩固，经济、文化建设事业突飞猛进。在两年中，工业产值增长了四倍多；农业产值增长了70％，羊只增长了55％；中、小学学生人数翻了一番。人民生活显著改善，社会商品零售额提高了60％以上。全区人口增加了四分之一。回汉人民形容自治区是“人财两旺”。今春以来各个战线上都取得了开门红的胜利，为今年社会主义建设新的跃进打下了基础。这一切表明，宁夏的面貌发生了重大变化。
    宁夏地区的社会主义建设大跃进，是遵循毛主席的不断革命论和革命发展的阶段论思想，不断解决生产关系与生产力、上层建筑与经济基础之间的矛盾，充分发挥人民群众的积极性的结果。在毛泽东思想的指导下，宁夏回族人民在社会主义建设大跃进的过程中，经历了一次极其深刻的变革和进步，走上了一个新的发展阶段。
    在和平土改的地区，由于反封建的任务尚未完成，披着宗教外衣的封建势力对回族人民的压迫和剥削，是回族人民发展进步的重大障碍。回族人民在社会主义觉悟大大提高，在全国的大跃进和人民公社化的高潮中，十分强烈的感到，不消灭民族内部残存的阶级压迫，不解除思想束缚，就不可能高速度的进行社会主义建设。在党的领导和支持下，回族人民向以宗教作掩护的残余封建势力进行了坚决的斗争，揭发了坏人坏事，废除了封建压迫和封建剥削制度，摆脱了封建束缚，解放了生产力。长期遭受封建束缚的回族妇女获得了解放，她们摆脱了家务纠缠，踊跃地走出了家门，揭掉了盖头，积极参加了工农业生产、政治文化学习和社会活动，同汉族妇女一道，成为社会主义建设的一支生力军。在固原专区进行的镇反补课运动，打击了披着宗教外衣的反革命分子和其他坏分子，社会秩序空前稳定。反对残余封建势力斗争的胜利，大大解放了回族群众的思想，使他们更加相信自己的力量，更加迫切的要求发展进步。在社会主义建设大跃进的鼓舞和推动下，他们自觉地改革了不利于生产发展的习俗，破除了迷信，树立了崭新的风尚，精神振奋，干劲十足。回族人民的进一步解放和迅速进步，为全区的社会主义建设增添了力量，有力的促进了大跃进和人民公社化的伟大群众运动，加速了社会主义事业的前进。
    社会主义革命的胜利，社会主义建设的大跃进，回族人民的进一步解放，使宁夏回、汉人民特别是回族群众提高了阶级觉悟，更加深刻地认识到各民族劳动人民利益的完全一致。历史上反动统治阶级制造的民族隔阂和歧视，已经被不分民族、不分彼此、亲密无间、通力协作的社会主义的民族关系所代替。人们不再以民族作为区别对方的标准，而是以阶级作为判断、分析的准绳，劳动人民之间的血肉关系、阶级的真诚友爱成为相互关系中最主要的内容。伟大的人民公社，又从组织上进一步巩固和发展了劳动人民之间利益一致、步调一致的关系。广大回汉人民在各个战线上一起劳动、一起学习、一起生活，共同为建设社会主义而奋战。社会主义革命的深入发展和社会主义建设的大跃进，使回汉人民不仅在思想上、行动上更加一致，而且在经济、文化水平上也更加接近了。随着社会主义事业的不断前进，一切阻碍民族进步和民族团结的消极因素必定会迅速被克服，回汉人民势必会更加接近，共同性一定会愈来愈发展。这是历史发展的必然趋势，也是宁夏回汉人民的长期向往和期望。对此，我们应当热情欢迎和积极促进，使民族关系上的这一进步趋势迅速向更高的阶段发展。
    回汉人民团结协作关系的日益巩固和不断加强，使宁夏地区的社会主义建设得到了最有力的保证，出现了全面、持续大跃进的局面。回汉人民团结一致、坚定不移地走上了共同繁荣的社会主义道路，更加珍爱相互之间的社会主义大团结，他们坚决地、主动地共同粉碎了一切危害社会主义、分裂民族团结的逆流。
    为了进一步巩固社会主义的民族大团结，我们坚持不懈地反对了资产阶级民族主义思想，特别是地方民族主义思想。地方民族主义是资产阶级思想在民族问题上的反映，它代表着少数民族中资产阶级和其他剥削阶级在社会主义革命不断胜利形势下的挣扎和反抗。因此，我们同地方民族主义的斗争具有一定的长期性。根据宁夏的情况，当前地方民族主义思想的主要表现形式是：在民族关系上保守排外，坚持甚至制造民族界限和民族差别。在经济建设上违背一盘棋的方针，不顾现实条件片面强调民族地区的需要。在文化上保持落后，不愿甚至阻碍群众改革陈规陋俗。有地方民族主义思想的人，总是以民族利益的保卫者自居，并且歪曲党和国家的民族政策，处心积虑地分裂民族团结，反对社会主义。因此，坚决反对地方民族主义，是正确贯彻党的民族政策，巩固民族团结，维护祖国统一，促进少数民族进步，保卫社会主义事业的重要环节。我们同地方民族主义的斗争，是民族地区社会主义同资本主义两条道路斗争的重要组成部分。这个斗争同整个阶级斗争的形势一样，是波浪起伏的。在宁夏，经过全民整风运动和反右派斗争，经过社会主义、共产主义教育运动，地方民族主义遭到了沉重的打击，它的活动市场大大缩小了。但是，既然阶级斗争还存在，我们就不能放松对地方民族主义思想的斗争。我们一定要不断地加强对人民群众的社会主义、共产主义教育，大力提高人民群众的觉悟水平，坚决批判和克服地方民族主义思想，并且在这种思潮一有抬头的时候，就彻底加以揭发和批判。
    经过两年多的大跃进，宁夏地区已经在促进民族融合、解决民族问题方面获得了一个十分良好的开端。这是党的建设社会主义总路线和民族政策的伟大胜利。今后，我们决心在党和毛主席的英明领导下，更好地团结回汉人民，更高的举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉旗帜，充分调动和发挥回汉人民的力量，为加速宁夏地区的社会主义建设，为建设社会主义的祖国大家庭而努力！
