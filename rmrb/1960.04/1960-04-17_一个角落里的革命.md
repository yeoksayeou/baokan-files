A Revolution in a Corner
Zhang Pei

What is the image of the mass movement of the technological revolution? Not long ago, people couldn't answer this question with concrete images. But today, as long as you go out and take a look, vivid pictures appear everywhere before your eyes. On April 7th, we came to the small mountain town of Chong'an County in northern Fujian. The streets were crowded with people, as if the entire population of this small city had taken to the streets, people packed in circles, and joyful gongs and drums were constantly beating. We had seen this scene in front of Tiananmen Square during festivals, but May 1st and October 1st had not yet arrived, so what were they doing? Upon closer inspection, we found that each circle contained a newly created machine or tool, and someone was performing and explaining it. The technological revolution has come to the streets, and the small city in the mountains is as boiling as Beijing, Shanghai, and Harbin.

\*　＊　＊

Quanzhou in southern Fujian is a famous hometown of overseas Chinese. The city has a population of about 100,000, and the streets are very tidy, with strong southern characteristics. When we arrived, some comrades from the local Party Committee went to the countryside to inspect the large-scale high-yield wheat, and some went to the factories to inspect the technological revolution. We chose another place to go, the Minnan Hotel, which receives guests. In Quanzhou, this is also a small corner, but the revolution has also been successfully carried out here.

The facade and furnishings of the hotel are old-fashioned. There are no revolving doors or floor-to-ceiling windows, and no sofas or soft beds in the rooms, but it has the most modern service facilities.

Ascending to the second floor, you will see a young woman sitting at the service desk. This is a special service desk. In front of her and on the table to her left are rows of signal lights and buttons. A guest returns from running errands outside. He doesn't have to find the attendant to get the key to open the door as usual. He can walk straight to the door of his room and press the button on the door. The signal light on the service desk indicating the room number lights up. Then the young woman flips the switch, and the door opens automatically. What if you go out? Similarly, you press the button to notify the female attendant at the service desk, and the door will lock automatically.

Quanzhou is an important city in southern Fujian and a thoroughfare to Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Guangdong. Travelers have to get up early to catch the bus, and some have to take care of some things before leaving, so they often have to get up in the middle of the night. People's habit is to tell the attendant the night before they leave what time they want to be woken up so that they don't oversleep and miss the bus. But now in the Minnan Hotel, you don't have to bother the attendants to wake you up. You just tell the service desk what time you want to get up tomorrow, and the woman pressing the button will insert a pin into the alarm clock according to your request. When the time comes, the electric bell under your bed will ring loudly, and you can get up on time.

Comrades who have stayed in hotels know that the attendants are really attentive now, and it is more convenient in the hotel than at home. But when you need the attendant's help, you always have to go find them. In hotels with doorbell equipment, you also have to use the doorbell to call the attendant and tell them what you want to do. You have run one less trip, but the attendant has to run one more trip. This trouble is now eliminated at the Minnan Hotel in Quanzhou. There is a small intercom in each room. If you need boiling water or want to buy a newspaper, you don't have to leave the room. Just say into the intercom what room number you need, and the woman at the service desk will answer you.

These all seem to be minor details in life. It seems that there is nothing remarkable without revolution. But as long as you go to the actual situation and touch it, you will find that these creations in hotels have the same important significance as mechanization and automation in factories. The manager of this hotel told us: The Minnan Hotel has a total of seventy rooms, which are supposed to accommodate one hundred and forty people. The entire staff of the hotel is fourteen people. However, since the Great Leap Forward, the number of passengers has been increasing, and they have had to increase the number of beds to more than two hundred. The workload of the attendants has also increased accordingly. The manager calculated with us: seventy rooms, full every day. Each room is calculated to be entered and exited six times a day (this is the minimum limit, with an average of three people living in each room, each person is only calculated to enter once and exit once), and the attendants need to open and lock the door four hundred and twenty times a day. According to the perennial law, the attendants have to wake up forty guests every day. As for the number of times guests look for attendants every day, it is impossible to count. Now that the revolution has been carried out, it has not only reduced the labor of the attendants and facilitated the passengers, but also reduced the number of service personnel from fourteen to ten. The service technology of the hotel has also leaped to a new level. Can you say that such a revolution is meaningless?

Perhaps some comrades will ask: Are these modern service equipment in the Minnan Hotel manufactured by large factories in Shanghai or Shenyang? That's not the case. These devices were all figured out by the service personnel of this hotel themselves a month ago. In the process of creation, they encountered many difficulties. The secretary of the Party branch resolutely supported them, the teachers of the normal school served as their electrical consultants, and the Quanzhou secondary wholesale station supported them with materials. So the revolution succeeded in this corner. When we visited, they were still continuing to trial-produce some new service tools, such as simple vacuum cleaners and "native TVs." If someone comes to visit, you don't have to go upstairs to find out if anyone is in the room. You can tell whether the person being visited is at home by looking at the indicator light on the "native TV" downstairs.

When the revolution is surging, throwing a stone will stir up a pile of waves. Now the other six hotels in Quanzhou are promoting the new technology of the Minnan Hotel. And the creators of the Minnan Hotel have become mechanical manufacturing workers equipping these hotels. In a small house behind the hotel, a small factory has been established. When we went, they were nervously producing server machinery for other hotels. Its influence has also gone beyond the scope of the hotel. The hospital in Anxi County also wants to apply their experience.

\*　＊　＊

The small mountain city of Chong'an is a small black dot that people cannot easily find on the map of our country. The Minnan Hotel is also a very, very small corner in Fujian Province, and people rarely pay attention to it. But these places are churning with the huge waves of the technological revolution. What is reflected from these small corners? It reflects that our Party's mass line and the policy of mass movement are not only the ever-victorious magic weapon for winning the victories of previous social revolutions, but also have achieved and are achieving great victories in the field of technological revolution. Some outdated ideas that ordinary workers and peasants cannot enter the mysterious door of technology have once again been ruthlessly impacted by the revolutionary wave.

The magnificent mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement will push my country's social productive forces to a high level! It won't be long before we can see it more clearly.

    一个角落里的革命
    张沛
    技术革命的全民性运动是怎样的一幅图景？不久以前，人们还不能用具体的形象来回答这个问题。而今天，只要你出去跑跑，生动的图景到处出现在你的眼前。4月7日，我们来到了闽北山区的小小的崇安县城。大街上人山人海，好像这个小城的全部人口都上街来了，人们一个圈一个圈地围得水泄不通，欢乐的锣鼓，不停地敲打着。这个景象，我们在节日的天安门前看见过，可是，5月1日和10月1日都还没有来到，他们是在干什么呢？钻进去一看，才发现每一个圈里是一台新创造的机械或者工具，有一个人在表演和说明。技术革命到大街上来了，深山中的小城和北京、上海、哈尔滨一样沸腾起来了。
                    ＊　＊　＊
    闽南的泉州市，是著名的华侨故乡，城市有十万左右的人口，街道很整齐，具有浓厚的南方特点。我们来的时候，这里地委的同志，有的下乡去验收大面积丰产的小麦去了，有的到工厂去视察技术革命去了。我们选择了另外一个去处，一个招待来往客人的闽南旅社。在泉州来说，这也是一个小小的角落，但革命也在这里成功地进行着。
    旅社的门面和陈设是老式的，既没有旋转门和落地窗，房间内也没有沙发和软床，然而这里却有着最现代化的服务设施。
    登上二楼，就看到一个年轻的妇女坐在服务台前。这是一个特别的服务台。她的正面和左边的桌子上有一排排信号灯和电钮。一个客人从外面办事回来了，他不用像通常的情况一样找服务员拿钥匙去开门，他可以一直走到自己房间的门口，按一下门上的电钮，这边服务台上标明着几号房间的信号灯就亮了，于是这个年轻的女同志，扳一下电钮，那边房门就自动打开了。如果你出门呢？同样地，你按一下电钮，通知服务台的女服务员，门就会自动锁上。
    泉州，是闽南地区的一个重要城市，是到福州、厦门、樟州和广东的要道。旅客们为了赶班车要起得很早，有的在临行前还要办些事，常常半夜就得起床。人们的习惯是在临行的前一个晚上告诉服务员，几点钟叫自己起床，免得一觉睡过去误了点赶不上车子。可是现在在闽南旅社不必劳驾服务员同志来叫醒你了。你只要告诉服务台明天几点钟起床，那个按电钮的女同志就会按照你的要求，把一个插梢插在摧醒器上。到时候，在你的床底下，电铃就当当响起来，你就可以准时起床了。
    住过旅馆的同志都晓得，现在的服务员真是服务得周到，在旅馆中比在家里还方便。但是当有事情要服务员同志帮助的时候，你总得跑去找一下。在有电铃设备的旅馆里也得用电铃把服务员找来，告诉他要办什么事。你少跑了一趟，但服务员却要多跑一趟。在泉州的闽南旅社这个麻烦现在也省去了。每个房间里有一个小小的通话器，如果你需要开水或者买一份报纸，那末你不必走出房门，只要对着通话器说一声几号房间需要什么，那边服务台上的女同志就会答应你。
    这些，看起来都是生活中的细微末节。似乎不革命，也没有什么了不起。可是你只要到实际中去摸一下，你就会发现这些创造在旅馆中和机械化、自动化在工厂中一样有着重要的意义。这个旅社的经理告诉我们：闽南旅社共有七十个房间，按照规定住一百四十个人。旅社的全部工作人员是十四人。可是大跃进以来，旅客不断增加，不得不把床位增加到两百多。服务员的工作量也跟着增加。经理和我们算了一笔账：七十个房间，每天住得满满的。每个房间，按每天进出六次计算（这是最低限度，每个房间平均住三个人，每人每天只计算进一次出一次），每天服务员就需要开门锁门四百二十次。根据常年的规律，服务员每天要叫四十个客人起床。至于每天客人找服务员的次数更是无法统计了。现在革了命，不但减轻了服务员的劳动，便利了旅客，而且服务人员从十四人减为十个人。旅社的服务技术也飞跃到一个全新的水平。你能说这样的革命没有意义吗？
    也许有同志要问：闽南旅社的这些现代化的服务设备，是不是上海或者沈阳的大工厂制造的？恰恰不是。这些设备都是这个旅社的服务人员在一个月以前自己琢磨出来的。在创造的过程中遇到不少困难，党的支部书记坚决支持他们，师范学校的教员作他们的电气顾问，泉州的二级批发站从材料上支援他们。于是革命就在这个角落中成功了。当我们访问的时候，他们还在继续试制一些新的服务工具，比如简易的吸尘器、“土电视机”等。如果有人来访，房间中有没有人，不必上楼去找，在楼下一看“土电视机”上的指示灯，就知道被访问者在不在家。
    在革命如潮涌的时候，一块石头投下去会激起一堆浪花。现在泉州另外的六家旅社，都在推广闽南旅社的新技术。而闽南旅社的创造者们，又成了装备这些旅社的机械制造工人。在旅社后面的一个小房子里，一个小工厂已经建立起来，我们去的时候，他们正在紧张地为别的旅社生产服务器械。它的影响也已经超出了旅社的范围，这在安溪县的医院，也想应用他们的经验了。
                      ＊　＊　＊
    小小的山城崇安，在我们国家的版图上是一个人们不容易找到的小黑点。闽南旅社，在福建省也是一个很小很小的角落，人们也很少注意到它。可是这些地方，都翻腾着技术革命的巨浪。从这些小小的角落中反映出什么呢？反映出我们党的群众路线和群众运动的方针，不但是取得历次社会革命胜利的百战百胜的利器，而且在技术革命的领域中已经和正在取得大胜。一些认为普通的工人、农民不能进入神秘的技术之门的陈腐观念，再一次受到革命浪潮的无情冲击。
    波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动，将把我国的社会生产力推进到一个高高的境界呢！不要很久，我们就可以看得更清楚了。
