Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and will earnestly implement them in my future work. I would now like to make a statement on the horse breeding and improvement work in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province. Please offer any criticism or corrections if there are any inaccuracies.

	Improved horses, truly good,
	Strong strength, tall height.

Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the provincial and prefectural committees, Keshan County's animal husbandry production has achieved great development in recent years. In particular, the work of horse breeding and improvement has, in a short period of time, cultivated 10,156 first and second-generation improved foals from the "Don River" horse breed imported from the Soviet Union. Not only does every community and district in the county have improved foals, but more than 4,000 have been provided to fraternal cities and counties. The management area with the most improved foals has more than 100, accounting for more than half of the total number of horses. Due to the breeding and improvement of horses, the number has greatly increased, and the quality has significantly improved. The local horses, which were once short in stature, slow in development, and weak in draught power, have been improved into improved horses that are fast-growing, tall, strong, muscular, brightly colored, docile, resistant to roughage, and suitable for both riding and draught. Actual tests show that the draught power of improved horses is more than 30% higher than that of local horses. The masses praise:

	The Communist Party leads well,
	Golden foals run all over the ground,
	Strong strength, tall height,
	Horse improvement is truly good.

Four Key Achievements

The main reasons why Keshan County's foal breeding and improvement work has achieved some success are:

First, put politics in command and give thought priority. Horse breeding and improvement is a technical reform in animal husbandry production. Experience tells us that any revolution, in its growth and development, will encounter various ideological obstacles from all sides. There is also a struggle between two roads and two ideologies. The technical revolution process of horse breeding and improvement is no exception. Therefore, we must adhere to putting politics in command and ideologically eliminate various obstacles on the road ahead. Only when ideological work is done deeply and thoroughly, and ideological problems are completely solved, can we have a great leap forward in economic work.

At the beginning of adopting artificial insemination for breeding, cadres and the masses had many doubts about the scientific nature of artificial insemination. Some cadres did not dare to vigorously publicize and organize the masses; many masses did not recognize or accept it. Some masses said, "Horse breeding with a horse is not always accurate, how can artificial insemination work?" In addition, there was no experience at the beginning, which caused three fears among the masses: first, fear of inaccurate breeding; second, fear that the mare would not be able to produce a foal; and third, fear that the foal would not be strong after birth and would not survive. Based on this situation, extensive and in-depth publicity and education on horse breeding and improvement were carried out. On the one hand, the scientific nature of artificial insemination was explained theoretically, and on the other hand, physical exhibitions were held. An artificial foal competition was held every spring. Practice has proved that educating the masses through facts is the most direct, practical, and effective method. In the work, leading cadres took the lead in taking horses to the station for breeding, timely summarized and exchanged experiences, and organized cadres and the masses to visit and study in other places, especially to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, boldly carried out creation and technological innovation, so that horse breeding and improvement achieved remarkable results. After some communes had tractors, a few cadres and the masses believed that "mechanization is not far away after communization, and horses are not very useful." Some grassroots leading cadres only paid attention to grasping agricultural production and neglected the leadership of animal husbandry production, resulting in a one-sided emphasis on agriculture and neglect of animal husbandry. Repeated publicity and education were conducted on the one-sided ideological emotions of not wanting horses and cattle and emphasizing agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry. Many facts were used to explain that under the current situation of fewer tractors, livestock are indispensable and are the main driving force of agriculture. Even after mechanization is realized, livestock will still play a large role in agricultural production. On the basis of raising awareness, incorrect ideological emotions were reversed. Right-leaning was opposed, superstition was eliminated, and thought was liberated. Some people overemphasized the "prudence" and "condition" of technological innovation, were right-leaning and conservative, stagnated, and hindered the development of the technological innovation movement. For example, after carrying out technological innovation and implementing the method of long-distance transportation of semen for breeding, some people were full of doubts, thinking it was "nonsense, the sperm would be shaken to death." Others feared that there would not be enough semen to breed all the mares. We carried out a resolute struggle against these various right-leaning conservative ideas. With a daring and hard-working communist style, we conducted research and experiments, made practical results, and solved ideological problems, basically achieving full breeding and full accuracy. In this way, we constantly solved ideological problems, improved the level of awareness, and carried out the struggle between two roads, so that horse breeding and improvement work advanced step by step, laying an ideological foundation for the great harvest of the whole year.

Second, rely on the masses and launch a large-scale mass movement. Practice has proved that adhering to the general line and launching a large-scale mass movement can ensure the high-speed development and continuous leap forward of socialist construction. In horse breeding and improvement work, we widely mobilized and organized the masses, so that the whole party took action and the whole people were mobilized. Not only did horse breeders take horses to the station for breeding, but also old ladies in their fifties and sixties, young women, and children actively participated in this work. In the movement, the wisdom of the masses was fully utilized. All possible means were used to ensure that all mares were bred accurately. The masses also created some methods for mares that were not in heat. After breeding, 673 of 896 barren mares that had abnormal heat and had not been accurately bred in previous years became pregnant. In the movement, various forms of political propaganda and mobilization were fully utilized. Large-scale comparisons, competitions, evaluations, and awards were carried out, which strongly promoted breeding work. At the beginning of breeding, a red flag competition movement was carried out between stations and communes, with the content of large quantity and good quality of breeding. It was insisted that an evaluation be conducted once a month. Each evaluation and award greatly encouraged the enthusiasm, forming a red flag competition movement to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, surpass the advanced, strive for glory, and become a model, which quickly set off a climax of horse breeding work.

Third, break superstitions and continuously innovate. Vigorously carrying out animal husbandry technical revolution is an important measure for high-speed, large-scale development, full improvement, and realization of full breeding and full accuracy. It is also an important way to realize horse breeding and improvement quickly, well, and economically. Due to the continuous breaking of superstitions and liberation of thought, the regularity of mare estrus was correctly identified, the highest stage of mare estrus was mastered, the number of semen infusions and retrievals was reduced, and the amount of semen infusion was appropriately reduced, which not only guaranteed pregnancy but also achieved more breeding. In recent years, not only has the original technical level been improved, but also a large number of farmer horse breeding technicians have been trained, the technical level has been continuously improved, and the team of horse breeding technical cadres has been continuously strengthened and has supported other places.

Fourth, protect the fetus and raise good foals. Strengthening the work of protecting the fetus and raising foals is an important key to achieving horse breeding and improvement, breeding more, producing more foals, and ensuring more survival.

Doing a good job of protecting the fetus is a prerequisite for ensuring full production. In this regard, the inherent experience of the masses was timely summarized. A system of contracting pregnant livestock by head was implemented, and pregnant livestock were given obvious signs. It was stipulated that they should not go on three platforms (grinding platform, mill platform, well platform) and follow the "ten no's": no driving shafts, no long-distance travel, no sharp turns, no feeding moldy grass feed, no drinking cold water, no hitting cold whips, no squatting in the pen, no running sleds, etc. This system was signed into a fetal protection contract by feeders, transporters, commune members, and captains, stipulating a reward and punishment system. The county animal husbandry bureau and the livestock hygiene institute jointly researched and manufactured fetal protection Chinese medicine, which achieved remarkable results after pregnant livestock were given it. A delivery room was established when pregnant livestock produced foals, and full-time delivery workers were set up to take delivery, so the phenomenon of foal loss and abandonment was reduced from 58.5% in the past to about 31%, ensuring full production and full survival. In 1959, the Dawn Management Area of the Beixing People's Commune produced 33 horses, all of which survived.

On the basis of achieving a great leap forward and a great harvest in horse breeding and improvement work for two consecutive years, 1960 will undoubtedly be a year of sustained great leap forward and great harvest. According to the requirements of the Second Session of the Second Heilongjiang Provincial Party Congress to "vigorously build animal husbandry bases, vigorously launch mass movements for the great development and full improvement of animal husbandry centered on pig raising," we must have lofty aspirations, set great ambitions, hold high the red flags of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes, and strive to realize horse improvement ahead of schedule!

    繁殖大量良马
    杨显亭代表介绍克山县大力开展马匹繁殖改良工作的成就主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念副总理所作的报告，并在今后工作中认真贯彻执行。现仅就黑龙江省克山县马匹繁殖改良工作，作一发言，如有不当之处，请予以批评指正。
    改良马，真正好
    力气大，个头高
    克山县的畜牧业生产在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在省、地委的领导下，几年来获得大发展。特别是马匹繁殖改良工作，在短短的几年时间就培育出从苏联引进来的“顿河”马种一二代改良驹一万零一百五十六匹。全县不仅社社区区都有改良驹，而且还支援了兄弟市县四千多匹，改良驹最多的管理区已达百余匹以上，占总马匹数的一半还多。由于马匹的繁殖改良，数量有很大增加，质量显著提高，昔日体躯矮小、发育慢、挽曳力不大的本地马，已经改良成为发育快、体躯高大、体质坚实、肌肉发达、毛色鲜明、性情温顺、耐粗饲料和适于乘挽兼用的改良马。经实际测验，改良马的挽曳力比本地马提高30％以上。群众赞扬说：
    共产党领导的好，
    金马驹子满地跑，
    力气大，个头高，
    马匹改良真正好。
    获得成就的四个关键
    克山县马驹繁殖改良工作，所以能获得一些成就，主要原因是：
    第一、政治挂帅，思想领先。马匹的繁殖改良是畜牧业生产中的一项技术改革。经验告诉我们，任何一项革命在它的成长与壮大过程中，都会遇到来自各方面的各种思想阻力，同样存在着两条道路、两种思想的斗争，马匹繁殖改良的技术革命过程也毫不例外。因此，必须坚持政治挂帅，从思想上扫除前进道路上的各种障碍。只有思想工作做的深透，彻底地解决了思想问题，有了思想大跃进，才能有经济工作的大跃进。
    在开始采取人工授精方法配种时，从干部到群众对人工授精的科学性怀疑重重，部分干部不敢大力宣传和组织发动群众；很多群众不认识不接受，有的群众说“马配马还不准呢，人工授精哪能行。”加之初搞没有经验，在群众中产生了三怕思想：一怕配不准，二怕母马产不下来驹。三怕产后不硬实，养不活白搭工。根据这种情况，广泛深入地开展了马匹繁殖改良工作大宣传、大教育。一方面从理论上说明人工授精的科学性，另一方面进行实物展览，每年春季都召开人工驹比赛会。实践证明，通过事实对广大群众进行教育是最直接、最实际、最有效的。在工作中领导干部带头牵马到站配种，及时总结交流经验，组织干部和群众到外地参观学习，特别是学习苏联的先进经验，大胆地进行创造和技术革新，使马匹的繁殖改良收到了显著效果。在部分公社有了拖拉机以后，少数干部和群众认为“公社化后离机械化不远了，马匹用途不大了”，部分基层领导干部只注意了抓农业生产，忽略了对畜牧业生产的领导，产生了重农轻畜的片面性。对于有了拖拉机不要马牛和重农轻畜的片面思想情绪，进行了反复的宣传教育，通过许多事实说明在目前拖拉机较少的情况下，牲畜是不可缺少的，是农业的主要动力，就是在实现了机械化以后，牲畜在农业生产中仍会有很大作用。在提高认识的基础上，扭转了不正确的思想情绪。反掉了右倾，破除了迷信，解放了思想。有些人过分强调技术革新“稳重论”、“条件论”，右倾保守，停滞不前，阻碍了技术革新运动的开展。如在开展技术革新，实行了远距离输送精液配种方法以后，有些人疑虑多端，认为是“瞎扯，精子颠搭也颠搭死了”。还有的人怕精液不足，不能全配。我们对这形形色色的右倾保守思想进行了坚决的斗争。并以敢想敢干的共产主义风格，进行研究试验，作出实效，解决了思想问题，基本达到了全配、全准。就这样不断地解决思想问题，提高认识水平，开展两条道路的斗争，使马匹繁殖改良工作步步前进，为全年的大丰收奠定了思想基础。
    第二、依靠群众，大搞群众运动。实践证明，坚持总路线，大搞群众运动，就可以保证社会主义建设事业的高速度发展和持续跃进，在马匹繁殖改良工作中，我们广泛地发动与组织群众，作到了全党动手，全民动员，不仅配马员牵马到站配种，也有五、六十岁的老太太、年青的妇女、小孩积极参加这一工作。在运动中充分地发挥广大群众的智慧，千方百计地使母马全配全准，对不发情的母马，群众也创造了一些办法，使发情不正常，历年都配不准的八百九十六匹痞子母马经过配种，妊娠六百七十三匹。在运动中充分运用了各种政治宣传鼓动形式，开展了大比、大赛、大评、大奖，有力地推动了配种工作。在配种开始，站与站、社与社之间开展了以配种数量多、质量好为内容的红旗竞赛运动，坚持每月评比一次，每进行一次评比奖励都大大地鼓舞了干劲，形成了一个学先进、赶先进、超先进、争光荣、当标兵的红旗竞赛运动，迅速掀起了马配种工作高潮。
    第三、破除迷信，不断革新。大搞畜牧技术革命是高速度大发展、全改良与实现全配全准的重要措施，也是多快好省地实现马匹繁殖改良的一个重要途径。由于不断地破除迷信、解放思想，这就正确摸清了母马发情的规律性，掌握了母马发情的最高阶段，减少了输精回收，并适当地减少了输精数量，既保证了妊娠，又达到了多配。几年来不仅提高了原有的技术水平，而且还培养了大批农民配马技术员，技术水平不断提高，马匹配种技术干部队伍不断壮大，并支援了外地。
    第四、保好胎，育好驹。加强保胎和育驹工作，是达到马匹繁殖改良，配的多、产驹多、成活多的一个重要关键。
    做好保胎工作，是保证全产的前提。在这方面及时总结了群众中固有的经验，实行了孕畜按头包干制，并给孕畜带上明显的标志，规定了三台不上（碾台、磨台、井台）和“十不”：不驾辕、不出长途、不拐陡弯、不喂霉草霅料、不饮冷水、不打冷鞭子、不蹲圈、不跑爬犁等等，并且把这个制度由饲养员、运输员、社员和队长参加签订成保胎合同，规定了奖惩制度，县畜牧局和家畜卫生院共同研究制造出保胎中药，孕畜灌后收到显著效果。孕畜产驹时建立了接产室，设专职接产员接产，因而使流驹、掉驹现象由过去的58.5％减少到31％左右，保证了全产、全活。北星人民公社曙光管理区1959年产三十三匹马全都活了。
    马匹繁殖改良工作，在连续两年取得大跃进大丰收的基础上，1960年无疑地还将是一个持续大跃进、大丰收的一年。根据中共黑龙江省二届二次党代大会提出的“大搞畜牧业基地，大搞以养猪为中心的畜牧业大发展和全改良的群众运动”的要求，我们一定要树雄心、立大志，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，为提前实现马匹改良化而努力！
