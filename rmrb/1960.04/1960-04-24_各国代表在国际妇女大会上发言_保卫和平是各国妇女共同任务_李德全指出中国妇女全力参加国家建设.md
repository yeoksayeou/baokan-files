Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, April 22nd (Our reporter Qian Xing) reports: The superiority of the socialist system, support for the struggles of the African people, and a strong desire for peace characterized the first day of the International Women's Congress, currently being held in Copenhagen to commemorate the 50th anniversary of International Women's Day.

    Soviet representative Nina Popova vividly described at the conference the contributions of Soviet women in building a richer life for the Soviet people.

    Mrs. Rameshvari Nehru, President of the Indian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, spoke about the tasks of women in promoting the relaxation of international tensions, disarmament, and cooperation among peoples of all countries.

    She said that colonialism is one of the sources of war. She called for continued efforts to achieve disarmament and to use the money earned through the hard work of farmers and workers for their welfare, rather than for armaments.

    Li Dequan, head of the Chinese delegation and Minister of Health, said at the conference that while Chinese women are fully engaged in transforming their economically backward country into a completely new and prosperous nation, they have greatly improved their material and cultural lives and have increased their abilities to the extent that they can more fully participate in the broad range of creative work provided for them. She said that the comprehensively developing rural and urban people's communes make it possible for women to achieve complete liberation. Chinese women are delighted with their unlimited opportunities and recognize their responsibility, along with peace-loving women from all countries, to defend world peace.

    Mrs. Guillén de Nicolaou of Mexico spoke about the education and cultural development of women. She pointed out that the achievements of the Soviet Union and China in carrying out education among the people, especially in eliminating illiteracy, are unparalleled.

    Swedish Doctor of Science Britta Åkerman-Johansson spoke about the dual tasks of women in social activities and family responsibilities. She told the representatives about what she had seen in China and described the situation of Chinese farmers happily eating in commune canteens and their children being cared for by nurseries while they worked in the fields.

    When an African-American representative read a congratulatory letter to the conference from Shirley Graham (Mrs. Du Bois) of the Action Committee of African-American Women in the United States, the entire conference stood up to express a warm welcome.

    Shirley Graham was unable to attend the conference due to travel restrictions imposed by the US government.
