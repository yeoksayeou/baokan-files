Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 20th: The "Burma New Times" published an editorial today, warmly welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's meeting with Prime Minister Nehru in New Delhi, and expressed the hope that the Sino-Indian border issue would be resolved as soon as possible.

The editorial stated that all peace-loving people in Asia should be grateful to China for its pragmatic spirit regarding the Sino-Indian border issue talks. The editorial said that Burma, China, and India are closely linked, intimate neighbors. The border disputes between China-Burma and China-India have undoubtedly been used by Western countries as a means of alienation to create misunderstanding and distrust of China. The editorial pointed out that the sole aim of Western countries is to divide Asian unity in order to rule them.

The editorial stated that the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Agreement proves that China "is neither a colonialist, nor an expansionist or aggressor." With the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression, all malicious propaganda directed against China, all cunning tricks and news of the Western propaganda machine against China, have come to an end.

The editorial also said, "Since the Chinese Premier is meeting with Nehru, all Western countries that aim to alienate India and China and create distrust and suspicion between them will watch the current process with horror."

The "Mandalay Daily" published an editorial yesterday on Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma, saying that due to Premier Zhou Enlai's repeated visits to Burma, "the friendship and harmonious relations between China and Burma have been strengthened and consolidated." The editorial said: "In fact, this close and friendly relationship will be even more consolidated in the future than it is now."

Regarding the Sino-Burmese Boundary Agreement, the newspaper said that it "will definitely contribute greatly in principle to the final resolution of the border issue between the two countries."

The newspaper concluded, "It is believed that the final implementation of the Boundary Agreement can be successfully resolved on the basis of understanding, magnanimity, and reconciliation."

    缅甸报纸评周总理缅印之行
    中国坚持友好睦邻政策  西方恶意宣传彻底破产
    新华社仰光20日电　“缅甸新时代报”今天发表社论，热烈欢迎周恩来总理到新德里同尼赫鲁总理举行会晤，并且表示希望尽早解决中印边境问题。
    社论说，亚洲所有爱好和平的人们应当感激中国对中印边界问题会谈所抱的实事求是的精神。社论说，缅甸、中国和印度是紧紧相连的亲密邻国。中国——缅甸和中国——印度的边境争执无疑已被西方国家利用为误解和不相信中国的离间手段。社论指出，西方国家的唯一目标是分裂亚洲的团结从而统治它们。
    社论说，中缅边界协定的签订，证明中国“既不是殖民主义者，也不是扩张主义者或侵略者”。随着中缅友好和互不侵犯条约的签订，矛头针对中国的一切恶意宣传，西方宣传机器对中国的一切狡猾的伎俩和新闻就宣告寿终正寝了。
    社论又说，“既然中国总理在同尼赫鲁会晤，以离间印度和中国、在它们中间制造不信任和猜疑为目的的所有西方国家必将以惊恐的心情注视目前的进程。”
    “曼岱日报”昨天就周恩来总理访问缅甸发表社论说：由于周恩来总理多次访问缅甸，“中缅两国之间的友谊及和睦关系已经得到加强和更加巩固。”社论说：“事实上，这种密切友好的关系今后将比现在还要巩固”。
    这家报纸在谈到中缅边界问题协定时说，它“一定会从原则上大大有助于最后解决两国之间的边界问题。”
    这家报纸最后说，“人们相信在谅解、宽宏和和解的基础上，胜利地解决边界问题协定的最后实施是可能的。”
