Red Light Commune Radiates Red Light
Speech by Committee Member Zhou Guilin

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and support the reports by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, as well as all other reports of the conference. I represent all members of the Red Light People's Commune in Pi County, Sichuan Province, and pledge to the Party and Chairman Mao that we will firmly hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960!

Last Year's Production Developed, Members' Incomes Increased

Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the brilliance of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, all members of our Red Light People's Commune, full of ambition and soaring enthusiasm, actively responded to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao and resolutely implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. As a result, our commune's various production and construction undertakings in 1959, especially agricultural production, achieved continuous great leaps forward and bumper harvests. Take the "Red Light Management Area" (production brigade) of my Red Light People's Commune as an example: the total output value of the entire management area's 8,031 mu of cultivated land reached 1,358,653 yuan, averaging 383 yuan per person. The total grain output reached 9,282,825 jin, averaging 1,497 jin per mu, an increase of 30.5% compared to 1958; among which, rice yield was more than 1,113 jin per mu, and the highest 12.2 mu of land reached 3,124 jin per mu. While grain crops had a bumper harvest, economic crops also achieved high yields. The average yield of rapeseed in the entire management area was 196 jin per mu, among which the 50 mu of "Happiness Field" that Chairman Mao visited averaged 500 jin per mu, and the best 2.3 mu of land reached as high as 721 jin.

Due to the continuous great leaps forward in production, the lives of commune members have greatly improved. Under the commune's distribution system combining wages and supply, in 1959, after paying agricultural tax, deducting investment for next year's production, public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, and reserve grain, each member received an average of 91.87 yuan in cash, an increase of 13% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958; at the same time, there was also 360 jin of ration grain. Households that were overdrawn in the past during the advanced cooperative era have now all become surplus households.

The People's Commune is Truly Good, We Have Canteens to Rely On

In the situation of a bumper harvest, the commune Party committee, based on the spirit of grasping both production and life, made good arrangements for the lives of commune members. Our Red Light Management Area established twelve public canteens. More than 3,600 commune members all participated in the public canteens, and grassroots cadres and Party and League members also ate in the canteens. Each canteen adopted the methods of "planned use of grain, economical use of grain," "determining rations based on the number of people, distributing rations, eating in the canteen, and returning the surplus to oneself," averaging one jin of unprocessed grain and two to three jin of vegetables per person per day, eating more during busy farming seasons and less during slack farming seasons; usually two dishes and one soup per meal; adhering to the spirit of "raising more (pigs) and eating less," currently having "meat feasts" twice a month, eating about half a jin of meat, and also eating "Nine Big Bowls" during festivals. In terms of grain rations, good care was given to children, the elderly, pregnant women, and the sick. Each canteen not only ensured that the members ate enough, ate well, and ate cleanly and hygienically, but also saved grain. For example, our First Canteen saved more than 380 jin of rice in February of this year, and the Third Canteen saved 410 jin of rice. Each canteen established its own foundation, actively planting vegetables, raising pigs, and raising poultry. Currently, the entire management area has planted 150 mu of vegetables and raised 2,005 pigs. Last year, the pigs raised by the twelve canteens, in addition to the portion consumed by themselves, sold more than 28,000 jin to the state, which supported national construction and increased canteen income, improving the lives of commune members.

Our public canteen is not only a place for the vast number of commune members to eat, but also a place for members to hold meetings to discuss production, conduct studies, and engage in cultural and recreational activities, becoming a warm family for the members. At present, the idea of taking the canteen as one's home has been firmly established among the vast number of commune members. The members generally praise it, saying: "The People's Commune is truly good, we have canteens to rely on." Poor peasants Chen Chaofa and Zhao Qingquan said: "With such good days, even if we work from dawn till dark, our hearts are at ease."

The Elderly are Provided for, the Young are Nurtured - Beautiful Aspirations Begin to be Realized

In our People's Commune, the entire lives of the elderly and children have been well arranged. The elderly have entered the homes for the elderly, and the children have entered the kindergartens and nurseries. All their expenses are borne by the People's Commune. "The elderly are provided for, and the young are nurtured" is the beautiful aspiration of our working people. This aspiration can only be realized today under the leadership of the Communist Party.

In order to protect the health of commune members, our commune has established a hospital with one hundred beds, and each production team has also established a health station. Due to the soaring enthusiasm of our commune's medical staff, they not only actively treated illnesses but also vigorously led the masses to carry out epidemic prevention work, improve environmental sanitation, and personal hygiene. Now, our commune has achieved the "Seven Nos": no flies, no mosquitoes, no rats, no sparrows, no cockroaches, no fleas, no lice, becoming a "Seven Nos" commune. Commune members are all radiant, with rosy complexions, and the labor attendance rate is as high as 98% or more.

Our members have both tense labor and pleasant rest. Now, in addition to a radio station and a film projection team, the commune has also organized an amateur cultural troupe. They have united the vast number of activists in cultural and recreational activities in the commune, enlivening the members' cultural life, and pleasant songs make people forget their fatigue.

From our personal experience, we deeply know, who has opened up the road to a happy life for us? It is the great Communist Party and the wise leader Chairman Mao. We have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's instruction to us during his inspection of our commune in March 1958 to "radiate red light." We are determined to set great ambitions, unfold grand plans, and vow to seize higher yields and bumper harvests again. Now, all our members, holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, are striving for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960, aiming for a rice yield of 1,500 jin per mu, striving to reach 2,000 jin, and a rapeseed yield of 600 jin per mu, striving to reach 700 jin! We believe that under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the strong help of our worker brothers, we will definitely be able to complete and overfulfill this arduous and glorious task.

Finally, let me shout:

Long live the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune!

Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!

Long live the great leader of the people of all nationalities, Chairman Mao!

### 红光社大放红光  周桂林委员的发言

专栏：

    红光社大放红光
    周桂林委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护陈叔通副主席、李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告，以及大会的其他各项报告。我代表四川省郫县红光人民公社全体社员，向党和毛主席保证，坚决高举毛主席思想红旗，为争取1960年更好更全面的跃进而奋斗！
    去年生产发展  社员收入增加
    我们红光人民公社全体社员，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉照耀下，满怀雄心壮志，干劲冲天，积极响应了党和毛主席的号召，坚决贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，因而使我社1959年各项生产建设事业，特别是农业生产，获得了连续大跃进，大丰收。仅以我所在的红光人民公社的“红光管理区”（生产大队）来说：全管区八千零三十一亩耕地，总产值达到一百三十五万八千六百五十三元，按人口平均三百八十三元。粮食总产量达到九百二十八万二千八百二十五斤，每亩平均一千四百九十七斤，比1958年增长30.5％；其中水稻亩产一千一百一十三斤多，最高的十二亩二分多地，每亩达到三千一百二十四斤。粮食作物大丰收的同时，经济作物也获得了高产。全管区油菜平均亩产一百九十六斤，其中毛主席到过的五十亩幸福田，平均亩产五百斤，最好的二亩三分多地，高达七百二十一斤。
    由于连年生产大跃进，社员生活有了很大改善。在公社的工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度下，1959年，除了交纳公粮、扣除下年生产投资、公积金、公益金和储备粮外，社员每人平均分得现金九十一元八角七分，比大跃进的1958年增长13％；同时，还有口粮三百六十斤。过去高级社时的超支户如今全部转变为有余户了。
    人民公社真正好  有了食堂有依靠
    在大丰收的情况下，公社党委根据既抓生产又抓生活的精神，很好地安排了社员的生活。我们红光管理区，办起了十二个公共食堂。三千六百多个社员全都参加了公共食堂，基层干部和党、团员也一律在食堂吃饭。各食堂采用了“计划用粮，节约用粮”、“以人定量，分配口粮，食堂吃饭，节余归己”的办法，平均每人每天吃原粮一斤、蔬菜二至三斤，农忙多吃，农闲少吃；平时每餐两菜一汤；本着“多养（猪）少吃”的精神，目前一个月打两次“牙祭”，吃肉半斤左右，逢年过节还要吃“九大碗”。在粮食定量上，对于儿童、老年人、孕妇、病员都作了很好的照顾。各个食堂，不仅保证了社员吃得饱、吃得好、吃得干净卫生，而且还节余了粮食。比如我们的第一食堂今年2月份就节约了大米三百八十多斤，第三食堂节约了大米四百一十斤。各个食堂都建立了自己的家底，积极种菜、养猪和养家禽。目前，全管区共种蔬菜一百五十亩，养猪二千零五头。去年十二个食堂养的猪，除自食部分外，卖给国家二万八千余斤，既支援了国家建设，又增加了食堂收入，改善了社员生活。
    我们的公共食堂，不仅是广大社员吃饭的地方，而且是社员开会讨论生产、进行学习和文化娱乐的场所，成了社员们温暖的大家庭。目前，以食堂为家的思想已经在广大社员中巩固地树立起来了。社员们普遍歌颂它说：“人民公社真正好，有了食堂有依靠。”贫农陈朝发、赵清泉说：“这样好的日子，就是一天干到黑、一晚干到亮，心头都安逸。”
    老有所终　幼有所养  美好愿望开始实现
    在我们人民公社里，老人和小孩的全部生活，得到了很好的安排。老人进了敬老院、小孩进了幼儿园和托儿组。他们的全部费用，均由人民公社负担。“老有所终，幼有所养”，是我们劳动人民的美好愿望。这个愿望只有在今天共产党领导下才得以实现。
    为了保障社员的身体健康，我们公社办起了一所拥有一百张病床的医院，各生产队也都设立了卫生室。由于我社医务工作人员的冲天干劲，一面积极治病，一面大力领导群众开展防疫工作，搞好环境卫生和个人卫生。现在，我社已经实现了无苍蝇、无蚊子、无老鼠、无麻雀、无蟑螂、无跳蚤、无虱子，成为“七无”公社了。社员们人人精神焕发，个个红光满面，劳动出勤率高达98％以上。
    我们社员，既有紧张的劳动，又有愉快的休息。现在，社里除已有一个广播站、一个电影队外，还组织了一个业余文工团，他们团结了社内广大的文娱活动积极分子，活跃社员的文娱生活，愉快的歌声使人们忘却了劳累。
    从我们切身体验中，我们深深知道，是谁给我们开辟了走向幸福生活的道路？是伟大的共产党和英明领袖毛主席。我们牢牢记住了毛主席1958年3月视察我社时给我们作的“大放红光”的指示。我们坚决立大志，展宏图，誓夺高产更高产，丰收再丰收。现在，我们全体社员，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的三面红旗，为1960年水稻亩产一千五百斤、争取达到二千斤，油菜亩产六百斤、争取达到七百斤的更好更全面的跃进而奋斗！我们相信，在党和毛主席的领导下，在工人弟兄的大力帮助下，一定能够完成和超额完成这艰巨而光荣的任务。
    最后，让我高呼：
    总路线、大跃进、人民公社万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
