Comrades, Friends!

　　Today, people from all walks of life in Beijing are holding a mass rally here to support the South Korean people's just struggle against the fascist dictatorial rule of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique. We, the people of the capital and the people of the whole country, express our utmost indignation at the bloody atrocities of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique in massacring and suppressing patriotic South Korean demonstrators; we express our boundless sympathy and resolute support for the South Korean people who are heroically fighting for national liberation, democratic freedom, and the right to survival.

　　As you know, a massive people's struggle has recently erupted in South Korea. Since mid-March, when the South Korean people held demonstrations to protest the Syngman Rhee clique's "elections," mass movements against US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique have unfolded in almost all major and medium-sized cities in South Korea. The demonstrators included young students, citizens, workers, teachers, staff, intellectuals, women, and elementary school students. The number of participants in each city increased from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. This large-scale people's struggle is unprecedented in South Korea. It is also rare in world history. On April 26, the people of Seoul held a city-wide demonstration of hundreds of thousands. The demonstrators surrounded the puppet National Assembly and Syngman Rhee's "official residence," stormed into Syngman Rhee's puppet cabinet, and burned down the Syngman Rhee Liberal Party headquarters and other reactionary institutions. They shouted slogans such as "Syngman Rhee, step down!" "Give me liberty, or give me death!" "Pay the blood debt!" When they demonstrated in front of the US Embassy, they distributed leaflets demanding that "US imperialism get out of South Korea immediately."

　　Since mid-March, US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique have been using violence to suppress the demonstrators and implement a reign of terror. They dispatched large numbers of military police and tanks, firing on the demonstrators, causing thousands of casualties. However, the South Korean people have not been intimidated by the US-Rhee clique's violence. The barbaric massacres and suppressions have instead aroused greater anger and more intense resistance to the reactionaries among the South Korean people. Under the impact of the South Korean people's heroic struggle, the South Korean traitorous ruling clique has already disintegrated, and Syngman Rhee, the United States' number one puppet, has been forced to announce his resignation. The South Korean people's just struggle has achieved initial victory. We, the Chinese people, congratulate the heroically struggling South Korean people and extend our highest respect!

　　The South Korean people's patriotic demonstrations are a heavy blow to US imperialism. Now, in order to save its enslavement rule in South Korea, US imperialism is intensifying its interference in the situation in South Korea. The US military command in Korea has sent back a division of the Syngman Rhee puppet army from the ceasefire line to participate in the suppression. The US military in Korea has launched "Honest John" missiles to intimidate the Korean people; the US Secretary of Defense has also stated that he will send additional US troops to Korea to strengthen the armed forces suppressing the South Korean people. On the other hand, US imperialism is playing deceptive tricks, pretending to sympathize with the South Korean people, in an attempt to ease the South Korean people's fighting spirit and divert their target. The US State Department held a meeting of the countries that participated in the Korean War the day before yesterday. Obviously, this shows that US imperialism is still preparing to expand its interference.

　　The US imperialist colonial rule is the root cause of all the disasters suffered by the South Korean people today. In order to permanently occupy the southern part of Korea and promote its colonial and war policies, the United States has stubbornly rejected the proposals repeatedly put forward by the Korean, Chinese, and Soviet governments for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

　　Through a series of treaties and agreements signed with the Syngman Rhee clique, the United States has controlled all economic sectors of South Korea. Under the guise of so-called "aid" and "relief," the United States has dumped its surplus goods on South Korea in large quantities, wantonly plundering South Korean resources and exploiting the South Korean people's blood and sweat. Under US colonial rule, South Korea has become a living hell. Prices in South Korea have increased more than 39,700 times compared to 1945; 3 to 4 million people in rural areas are without food every year; and the total number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in South Korea has reached more than 6.6 million. In order to suppress popular discontent, the Syngman Rhee clique has consistently implemented bloody massacres and suppression measures under the direction and support of the United States. The number of police in South Korea has now reached twice that of the late period of Japanese imperialist rule. In the past year alone, more than 240,000 people were arrested, imprisoned, and killed. The US invading troops in South Korea are even more rampant, committing murder, robbery, and rape, doing all kinds of evil. In the past year alone, more than 1,000 people have died in traffic accidents caused by US military vehicles, and many children and elderly people have been shot dead by the US military as "live targets." Fifteen years of painful life have made the South Korean people increasingly aware that US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique are the most vicious enemies of the South Korean people. Today, the South Korean people can no longer endure the fascist rule of the US-Rhee clique. In order to strive for national liberation, democratic freedom, and the right to survival, they have bravely stood up and launched a heroic and just struggle. Although the United States directed the Syngman Rhee clique to massacre and suppress the South Korean people, carrying out a frantic struggle, Syngman Rhee was still driven from power, which shows that the South Korean traitorous clique, even with the support of US bayonets, can no longer maintain its reactionary rule.

　　The people in southern Korea, like the people in northern Korea, strongly demand the peaceful reunification of the motherland and oppose the US imperialist plot to permanently divide Korea. However, due to the consistent obstruction and sabotage by US imperialism, the Korean people's national desire for peaceful reunification has not yet been realized. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people have continuously put forward reasonable proposals, demanding the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the implementation of free general elections throughout Korea through North-South consultation by the Korean people themselves, in order to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea.

　　The just demands of the Korean government and the Korean people for the realization of the peaceful reunification of their motherland have been supported by the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, as well as all peace-loving people. The Chinese people have always supported the Korean people's cause of striving for the reunification of their motherland and have made sincere efforts for this purpose. In October 1958, the Chinese People's Volunteers took the initiative to completely withdraw from Korea, creating favorable conditions for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. However, the US troops not only continue to赖皮 (persist, hang around) in South Korea but also wantonly violate the armistice agreement, transporting large quantities of new weapons, including nuclear weapons, into South Korea. This fully exposes the aggressive face of the United States to the world. US imperialism is deliberately strengthening its colonial rule over South Korea and continuing to maintain a military base for launching aggressive wars in the Far East.

　　On April 21, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party issued a letter to the South Korean people. On April 27, a joint meeting of leaders of political parties and social organizations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement to the world, calling on all patriotic forces in Korea to unite under the banner of the anti-US national salvation struggle, persevere in the struggle, force the US aggressor troops to immediately withdraw from Korean territory, completely abolish the Syngman Rhee fascist ruling structure, and realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland. It also suggested urgently convening a joint meeting of representatives of political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea to discuss countermeasures to deal with the current serious situation in South Korea. This call and proposal pointed out the correct path for the South Korean people's struggle and expressed the common desire of all the Korean people. The Chinese people fully support these calls and propositions.

　　Comrades, Friends,

　　The South Korean people's just struggle against US imperialism and the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee is by no means isolated. The people in the northern half of Korea stand with them. The Chinese and Japanese people, who are also suffering from US imperialist aggression, stand with them. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries support their struggle. They also have the sympathy and support of the people of all countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and even the world who love peace and uphold justice. At the same time, the Asian people's struggle against US imperialist aggression and interference, the African people's struggle for national independence, and the Latin American people's national democratic movement centered on anti-US imperialism are all powerful support for the South Korean people.

　　Today, volcanoes are everywhere under the feet of US imperialism, and they may erupt at any time. When the oppressed people reach the point of being unable to endure any longer, they have no choice but to rise up and fight a decisive battle with US imperialism for survival. In South Korea, which is under strict control, the people have risen up to oppose it. In Japan, where militarist forces are re-emerging, the people have risen up to oppose it. In its backyard of Latin America, the people have also risen up to oppose it. People all over the world are opposing it. The days of US imperialism are getting worse and worse. No matter how US imperialism struggles, the development of the situation will ruthlessly prove that history is always independent of the will of imperialism and reactionaries. Imperialism and all reactionaries are bound to die, and the oppressed people are bound to win.

　　The South Korean people's heroic struggle has achieved initial victory, but Syngman Rhee and his criminal clique have not yet been punished, and the US imperialist aggressor troops are still entrenched on Korean soil, interfering in Korean internal affairs, undermining the Korean people's just struggle, and attempting to maintain their colonial rule. We believe that with the support of the people of the world, as long as the South Korean people strengthen their unity, heighten their vigilance, and continue their struggle, they will surely be able to completely overthrow the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee and his criminal clique, drive the US aggressors out of South Korea, and realize their desire for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

　　While the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle against the US-Rhee clique's fascist rule is developing vigorously, the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan military alliance has also set off a new upsurge. Seven million Japanese people have participated in the unified struggle against the ratification of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," demanding "Immediate dissolution of the Diet," "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke government," and "Smash the Security Treaty." This is a new development in the Japanese people's anti-US struggle. The Chinese people firmly support the Japanese people's struggle and believe that they will achieve even greater victories.

　　Finally, let us shout:

　　Oppose US interference in Korean internal affairs!

　　Oppose the US-Rhee clique's massacre of patriotic South Korean people!

　　Punish the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique!

　　Support the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle!

　　Support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland!

　　Support the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan Security Treaty!

　　US troops, get out of South Korea!

　　US troops, get out of China's Taiwan!

　　US troops, get out of Japan!

　　US troops, get out of the Philippines!

　　US troops, get out of Asia!

　　People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, unite and overthrow imperialism!

　　Long live the national liberation movement of the world!

    坚决反对美李集团屠杀南朝鲜人民  全力支持南朝鲜人民爱国正义斗争
    刘宁一同志在首都各界人民支援南朝鲜人民爱国正义斗争大会上的讲话同胞们，同志们，朋友们！
    今天，我们北京市各界人民在这里举行群众大会，支援南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义和李承晚集团的法西斯独裁统治的正义斗争。我们首都人民和全国人民对美帝国主义和李承晚集团屠杀和镇压爱国的南朝鲜示威群众的血腥暴行，表示极大的愤怒；对正在为争取民族解放、民主自由和生存权利而英勇斗争的南朝鲜人民表示无比的同情和坚决的支援。
    大家知道，最近南朝鲜爆发了声势浩大的人民斗争。从3月中旬南朝鲜人民为反对李承晚集团的“选举”而举行示威游行以来，几乎在南朝鲜所有的大中城市都展开了轰轰烈烈的反对美帝国主义和李承晚集团的群众运动。参加示威的群众有青年学生、市民、工人、教员、职员、知识分子，有妇女、小学生。各城市参加的人数从几万人增加到几十万人。这种大规模的人民斗争在南朝鲜是从未有过的。在世界历史上也是不多见的。4月26日，汉城人民举行了数十万群众的倾城大示威。示威的群众包围了伪国会和李承晚的“官邸”，冲进了李承晚傀儡内阁，烧毁了李承晚自由党总部和其他反动机构。他们高呼“李承晚滚下台！”“不自由，毋宁死！”“偿还血债！”的口号。他们在美国大使馆面前示威时散发了要求“美帝国主义赶快滚出南朝鲜”的传单。
    自3月中旬以来，美帝国主义和李承晚集团一直用暴力来镇压示威群众，实行恐怖统治。他们调遣了大批军警和坦克，向示威群众开枪射击，千百人遭受伤亡。但是，南朝鲜人民并没有被美李集团的暴力所吓倒，野蛮的屠杀和镇压反而激起了南朝鲜人民的更大的愤怒和对反动派的更激烈的反抗。在南朝鲜人民英勇斗争的打击下，南朝鲜卖国统治集团内部已经分崩离析，美国的第一号傀儡李承晚已经被迫不得不宣布下台。南朝鲜人民的正义斗争已经取得了初步胜利。我们中国人民为此向英勇斗争的南朝鲜人民表示祝贺，并致以崇高的敬意！
    南朝鲜人民的爱国示威斗争是对于美帝国主义的沉重的打击。现在，美帝国主义为了挽救它在南朝鲜的奴役统治，正在对南朝鲜的局势加紧进行干涉。侵朝美军司令部从停战线派回李承晚伪军的一个师团参加镇压，侵朝美军放射了“诚实的约翰”导弹向朝鲜人民进行恫吓；美国防部长还表示要增派侵朝美军，来加强镇压南朝鲜人民的武装力量。另一方面，美帝国主义玩弄欺骗的手法，装出一副同情南朝鲜人民的面孔，妄想借此缓和南朝鲜人民的斗志，转移南朝鲜人民的目标。美国国务院前天召开了侵朝国家的会议。显然，这表明美帝国主义还在进行扩大干涉的准备。
    美帝国主义对南朝鲜的殖民统治是今天南朝鲜人民遭受的一切灾难的根源。美国为了永久霸占朝鲜南部地区，推行它的殖民政策和战争政策，顽固地拒绝了朝鲜、中国和苏联政府屡次提出的关于和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。
    美国通过和李承晚集团签订的一系列条约、协定，控制了南朝鲜所有的经济部门，美国在所谓“援助”、“救济”的幌子下，大量向南朝鲜倾销它的剩余商品，任意掠夺南朝鲜的资源和榨取南朝鲜人民的血汗。在美国的殖民统治下，南朝鲜已经变成了人间地狱。南朝鲜的物价同1945年比较已经上涨三万九千七百多倍；农村中每年三、四百万人绝粮，断炊；全南朝鲜失业和半失业人口达到六百六十余万人之多。为了镇压人民的不满，在美国指使和支持下，李承晚集团一贯实行了血腥屠杀和镇压的手段。目前南朝鲜的警察人数已经达到日本帝国主义统治末期的两倍。仅仅去年一年，被逮捕、监禁和杀害的就有二十四万多人。美国在南朝鲜的侵略军队更是横行霸道，杀人抢劫，强奸妇女，无恶不作。去年一年之间仅仅死在美军车祸之下的就有一千多人，许多儿童和老人被美军当成“活靶”打死。十五年的惨痛生活，使南朝鲜人民日益认清楚了美帝国主义和李承晚卖国集团是南朝鲜人民的最凶恶的敌人。今天南朝鲜人民已经无法继续忍受美李集团的法西斯统治。为了争取民族解放、民主自由和生存的权利，他们已经勇敢地站立起来，展开了英勇的正义斗争。尽管美国指使李承晚集团屠杀和镇压南朝鲜人民，进行疯狂的挣扎，但是李承晚还是被赶下台了，这说明南朝鲜的卖国集团即使依靠了美国的刺刀也已经不能照样维持它的反动统治了。
    朝鲜南部的人民同朝鲜北部的人民一样，强烈地要求实现祖国的和平统一，反对美帝国主义永久分裂朝鲜的阴谋。但由于美帝国主义一贯的阻挠和破坏，朝鲜人民要求和平统一的民族愿望，至今未能实现。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民曾经不断提出合理建议，要求撤退一切外国军队，由朝鲜人民自己经过南北协商，实行全朝鲜自由普选，以实现朝鲜的和平统一。
    朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民为实现祖国和平统一的正义要求，受到了苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家及一切爱好和平的人民的支持。中国人民一贯支持朝鲜人民争取祖国统一的事业，并为此作了真诚的努力。1958年10月，中国人民志愿军主动地全部撤出了朝鲜，为朝鲜问题的和平解决创造了有利的条件。但是，美国军队不但继续赖在南朝鲜不走，而且肆意破坏停战协定，把包括原子武器在内的新式武器大量运入南朝鲜。这就在全世界面前充分暴露了美国的侵略面貌，美帝国主义蓄意加强对南朝鲜的殖民统治，继续保持在远东发动侵略战争的军事基地。
    4月21日，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会发表了告南朝鲜人民书，4月27日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国各政党、社会团体领袖的联席会议向全世界发表了声明，号召全朝鲜的一切爱国力量，在反美救国斗争的旗帜下团结起来，坚持斗争，迫使美国侵略军立即撤出朝鲜土地，彻底废除李承晚法西斯统治机构，实现祖国的和平统一，并建议紧急召集南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体代表联席会议，讨论处理南朝鲜目前严重局势的对策。这个号召和建议指出了南朝鲜人民斗争的正确道路，表达了全体朝鲜人民的共同愿望。中国人民完全支持这些号召和主张。同胞们、同志们、朋友们，
    南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义和李承晚法西斯统治的正义斗争，绝不是孤立的。朝鲜北半部的人民同他们站在一起。同样受着美帝国主义侵略的中国人民和日本人民同他们站在一起。苏联和其他社会主义国家支持着他们的斗争。他们还得到全亚洲，全非洲，全拉丁美洲，甚至全世界爱好和平和维护正义的各国人民的同情和声援。同时，亚洲人民反对美帝国主义侵略和干涉的斗争，非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争，拉丁美洲人民以反美为中心的民族民主运动，都是对于南朝鲜人民的有力支持。
    今天，美帝国主义的脚下到处是火山，随时可能爆发。被压迫的人民到了忍无可忍的时候，为了生存，不能不起来同美帝国主义作决死的斗争。在严密控制下的南朝鲜，人民起来反对它。在军国主义势力正在重新抬头的日本，人民起来反对它。在它的后院拉丁美洲，人民也起来反对它。全世界的人民都在反对它。美帝国主义的日子越来越不好过。不论美帝国主义如何挣扎，形势的发展将无情地证明，历史总是不以帝国主义和反动派的意志为转移的。帝国主义和一切反动派必然要死亡，被压迫的人民一定要胜利。
    南朝鲜人民的英勇斗争已经取得了初步胜利，但是李承晚及其罪恶集团还未得到惩办，美帝国主义的侵略军队还盘踞在朝鲜的土地上，干涉朝鲜内政，破坏朝鲜人民的正义斗争，妄图维持其殖民统治。我们相信，南朝鲜人民在全世界人民的支持下，只要加强团结，提高警惕，继续斗争下去，他们就一定能够把李承晚及其罪恶集团的法西斯统治彻底打倒，把美国侵略者赶出南朝鲜，实现祖国和平统一的愿望。
    在南朝鲜人民反对美李集团法西斯统治的爱国正义斗争汹涌发展的同时，日本人民反对日美军事同盟的斗争也掀起了新的高潮。日本人民七百万人参加了反对批准日美“安全条约”的统一斗争，提出“立即解散国会”、“打倒岸信介政府”、“粉碎安全条约”的要求。这是日本人民反美斗争的一个新发展。中国人民坚决支持日本人民的斗争，并且相信他们一定会取得更大的胜利。
    最后让我们高呼：
    反对美国干涉朝鲜内政！
    反对美李集团屠杀南朝鲜爱国人民！
    惩办李承晚卖国集团！
    支持南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争！
    支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的斗争！
    支持日本人民反对日美安全条约的斗争！
    美国军队从南朝鲜滚出去！
    美国军队从中国的台湾滚出去！
    美国军队从日本滚出去！
    美国军队从菲律宾滚出去！
    美国军队从亚洲滚出去！
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民联合起来，打倒帝国主义！
    全世界的民族解放运动万岁！
