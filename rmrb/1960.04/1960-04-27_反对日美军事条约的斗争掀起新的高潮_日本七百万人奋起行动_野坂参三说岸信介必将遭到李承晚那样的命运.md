Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - News: Today, approximately seven million people across Japan participated in an unprecedented large-scale petition and demonstration, a first in Japanese history.

Today marked the final day of the fifteenth nationwide unified action against the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which began on the 15th. This nationwide unified struggle was led by the National Council to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," comprised of over 140 organizations including the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and two thousand joint struggle organizations established in prefectures, cities, towns, and villages.

The Japanese working class spearheaded the struggle today. Workers from the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), with 3.6 million members, and the Federation of Independent Unions held strikes and rallies across the country to oppose the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

In Tokyo, approximately one hundred thousand people from all walks of life, including workers, students, and cultural figures, began petitioning the National Diet from 10:00 AM. Petitioners, holding large banners that read, "We demand the cancellation of the 'Security Treaty'!" continuously surged towards the Japanese Diet Building like rolling waves. The line of petitioners stretched for a kilometer from Hibiya Park to the Diet entrance. Leading the procession were representatives from Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, Kanagawa, and many other prefectures. Each petitioner carried a petition and wore sashes or headbands inscribed with slogans such as: "Oppose the Diet's ratification of the 'Security Treaty'!", "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke government!", and "Immediately dissolve the Diet!".

At the Diet Building entrance, thirty Diet members from the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party greeted the petitioners.

After submitting their petitions to the Diet, the petitioners held demonstrations around the Diet, government office buildings, and in the central districts of Tokyo.

In addition, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Employees' Joint Struggle Council jointly held a rally in Shiba Park, attended by approximately twenty thousand workers.

The rally adopted a resolution expressing the workers' determination to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new "Security Treaty," to crush the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to further revise labor laws in a reactionary manner, and to fight for wage increases.

After the rally, the workers proceeded to the Diet to submit their petitions.

Meanwhile, over seven thousand students from various universities in Tokyo gathered at Shimizu Valley Park this afternoon and held a demonstration before submitting their petitions to the Diet.

The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today regarding the unprecedentedly large-scale petition and demonstration by the Japanese people to the Diet against the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The statement pointed out that today's large-scale petition and demonstration in Tokyo was a historically significant event. The statement said that the Japanese Socialist Party would resolutely prevent the Diet from ratifying the new "Security Treaty," overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and force the dissolution of the Diet.

In Osaka, approximately fifty thousand workers, youth, students, and citizens held a rally this afternoon to oppose the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

In Kyoto, workers and students held separate rallies in the morning. In the afternoon, another rally was held under the auspices of the Kyoto Joint Struggle Conference for the Defense of Peace and Democracy, resolutely demanding the abolition of the new "Security Treaty," the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government, and the dissolution of the Diet.

In Omuta City, Kyushu, over ten thousand workers held a mass rally. The workers of the Miike Coal Mine, who are bravely fighting against layoffs, also participated in the rally. In Shimane Prefecture, southern Honshu, people from all walks of life and government employees held general mobilization rallies in various locations. The rally in Matsue City, the prefecture's capital, was attended by tens of thousands of workers and students. A demonstration was also held after the rally.

In addition, mass rallies against the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" were also held today in Sendai and Sapporo in Hokkaido, Nagoya and Maebashi in Honshu, Fukuoka and other cities in Kyushu, and many other cities.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - News: Twelve thousand representatives from across Japan and Tokyo citizens held a central general mobilization rally in Tokyo tonight to oppose the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Mizuguchi Hirozo, Secretary-General of the National Council to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," said at the rally, "After the democratic forces, working in solidarity, just shattered the Liberal Democratic Party's conspiracy to force the Diet to end debate on the 'Security Treaty,' today's petition movement has achieved another great victory, demonstrating the strength of the people."

He said that, given the current situation, the Liberal Democratic Party and the Kishi Nobusuke government cannot get the Diet to ratify the new "Security Treaty" unless they extend the current Diet session.

Mizuguchi emphasized delivering them another blow in order to crush their conspiracy to ratify the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

He called on the participants to do everything possible to ensure the victory of the sixteenth nationwide unified action against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," scheduled for May 10-15, thereby overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke government and dissolving the Diet.

Mizuguchi Hirozo also said: The upcoming May Day demonstration is of great significance in promoting these goals.

Asanuma Inajiro, Chairman of the Socialist Party, and Nozaka Sanzo, Chairman of the Communist Party, also spoke at the rally.

Asanuma Inajiro emphasized that the petition to the Diet had achieved great success in reflecting the will of the people. He then pointed out: The fate of the Syngman Rhee clique clearly shows that justice always triumphs over injustice.

Asanuma Inajiro stressed, "If the Korean people can overthrow the Syngman Rhee government as they did, then the Japanese people can also overthrow Kishi Nobusuke, Syngman Rhee's partner in crime."

Nozaka Sanzo also pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke will sooner or later meet the same fate as Syngman Rhee.

The rally unanimously adopted a resolution. The resolution stated: While remaining vigilant against the actions of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling party, the Japanese democratic forces will continue to struggle until the conspiracy to pass the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet is crushed, the Kishi Nobusuke government is overthrown, and the Diet is dissolved.

    野坂参三说岸信介必将遭到李承晚那样的命运
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本全国今天共有七百万人左右在各地举行了日本历史上空前未有的大规模的请愿和示威。
    今天是日本人民从15日展开的第十五次反对批准新日美“安全条约”全国统一行动的最后一天。由日本共产党、社会党、日本工会总评议会等一百四十多个组织组成的阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议和在县、市、镇、村成立的两千个联合斗争组织领导展开了这一全国性的统一斗争。
    日本工人阶级今天率先展开了斗争。拥有三百六十万会员的日本工会总评议会和独立工会联合会的工人在全国各地举行了罢工和集会，反对批准新“安全条约”。
    在东京，工人、学生、文化界人士等各界人民共约十万人从上午十时开始陆续向国会进行了请愿。请愿群众高举着“我们要求取消‘安全条约’！”的横幅大标语，像滚滚的海涛连续不断地涌向日本国会大厦。请愿者从日比谷公园到国会门口排成了长达一公里的浩浩荡荡的队伍。走在请愿大军最前面的是来自大阪、京都、名古屋、神奈川等城市和许多县的人民代表。每一个请愿者都带着请愿书，他们戴着肩带或头巾，上面写着：“反对国会批准‘安全条约’！”，“打倒岸信介政府！”、“立即解散国会！”。
    在国会大厦门口，日本共产党和社会党的三十名国会议员迎接着请愿者。
    向国会递交了请愿书以后，请愿者在国会、政府办公大楼周围和东京中心区举行了示威游行。
    另外，日本工会总评议会和东京政府公务人员联合斗争会议在芝公园联合举行大会，参加大会的约两万名工人。
    大会通过决议，表示工人们决心阻止国会批准新“安全条约”、粉碎岸信介政府把劳工法修改得更加反动的阴谋，并决心为增加工资而斗争。
    大会结束后，工人们前往国会，向国会提交了他们的请愿书。
    同时，东京各大学七千多名学生今天下午在清水谷公园集合以后，举行了示威游行，并且到国会去提交了请愿书。
    日本社会党今天就日本人民向国会进行规模空前巨大的反对批准新日美“安全条约”的请愿和示威游行发表声明。声明指出，今天在东京的大规模请愿和示威游行是具有历史意义的事情。声明说，日本社会党要坚决阻止国会批准新“安全条约”，打倒岸信介内阁和迫使解散国会。
    在大阪，大约有五万工人、青年、学生和市民今天下午举行了反对国会批准新“安全条约”大会。
    在京都，工人和学生在上午分别举行了大会。下午，在京都维护和平与民主共同斗争会议主持下又举行了另一个大会，坚决要求废除新“安全条约”，要求岸信介政府辞职和解散国会。
    在九州的大牟田市，一万多名工人举行了群众大会。正在英勇地进行反对解雇斗争的三池煤矿工人也参加了大会。在本州南部的岛根县，各界人民和政府公务人员在各地举行了总奋起大会。在这个县的首府松江市举行的大会有数万名工人和学生参加。会后还举行了示威游行。
    此外北海道的仙台市、札幌市、本州的名古屋市、前桥市，九州的福冈市以及其他许多城市，今天也都举行了反对批准新日美“安全条约”的群众大会。
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本全国各地代表和东京市民代表一万二千人今天晚上在东京举行反对批准新日美“安全条约”中央总奋起大会。
    阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议事务局长水口宏三在大会上说，“在民主力量同心协力，刚刚粉碎了自由民主党企图强使国会结束关于‘安全条约’的辩论的阴谋后，今天的请愿运动已经取得另一次巨大的胜利，这表明人民的力量的强大。”
    他说，根据现在的情况，除非延长本届国会会期，否则自由民主党和岸信介政府就不可能使国会批准新“安全条约”。
    水口强调再给它们另一次打击以便粉碎它们企图批准新的日美“安全条约”的阴谋。
    他号召与会者竭尽全力以使预定于5月10日至15日举行的第十六次反对批准新“安全条约”全国统一行动获得胜利，从而推翻岸信介政府和解散国会。
    水口宏三并且说：即将来到的五一节示威，对于促进这些目的，具有重大的意义。
    社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎和共产党主席野坂参三也在大会上讲了话。
    浅沼稻次郎强调指出，向国会的请愿在反映人民的意志方面取得了巨大的成就。他接着指出：李承晚集团的命运显然表明，正义总是要压倒不正义的。
    浅沼稻次郎着重说，“如果朝鲜人民像他们所做的那样能推翻李承晚政府，那么日本人民也可能打倒李承晚的难兄难弟岸信介”。
    野坂参三也指出，岸信介迟早将遭到同李承晚一样的命运。
    大会一致通过了决议。决议说：日本民主力量在对岸信介政府和执政党的行动保持警惕的同时，将进一步继续进行斗争，直到粉碎国会通过新“安全条约”的阴谋、推翻岸信介政府和解散国会为止。（附图片）
