Metallurgical design work holds high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and continues to leap forward
Speech by Representative Yuan Huizhuo

I fully agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget draft.

Because I work in the metallurgical design field, although my exposure to design is only partial, and what I have seen is certainly not comprehensive, I would like to talk about my understanding of the guiding design ideology, the general situation of the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, and the path to future efforts in recent years and during the Great Leap Forward.

Design work is the nexus of politics, economy, and technology; while strengthening political concepts, it is also necessary to strengthen policy viewpoints.

Metallurgical enterprise design work did not exist in old China. In the past, bureaucratic capitalism completely relied on experts from imperialist countries, and whatever they said was taken as truth. Of course, designs were inevitably arranged according to the imperialists' attempts to plunder raw materials and exploit the Chinese people. To give an example from what I heard during an inspection this year: a copper smelter built in a certain place during the War of Resistance Against Japan had even a large stone trough weighing about twenty tons imported from England, so the workers called it "the wasteful stone." This not only illustrates the semi-colonial comprador nature of bureaucratic capitalism, but also demonstrates the lack of backbone in the technical thinking of the technical personnel at that time.

The metallurgical design team was established after liberation, and it has grown under the cultivation and education of the Party, and through continuous criticism of bourgeois design ideology, gradually improving its ideological level and design technical level. Precisely because design work is the nexus of politics, economy, and technology, with a strong policy nature, and requires technical personnel with knowledge to do specific work, the issue of design ideology is even more prominent and important. As early as the beginning of 1953, the Party grasped the design ideology work. At that time, a People's Daily editorial exposed several factories and mines under construction that had suffered adverse consequences due to erroneous bourgeois design ideology, which served as a wake-up call and initially educated the design personnel on design ideology. Subsequently, the gradual improvement of the design level is inseparable from the Party's frequent ideological education of the design personnel, prompting them to continuously strive for self-transformation. In terms of the work that design personnel generally come into contact with on a daily basis, although it manifests as technical problems, if they lack the guidance of proletarian political thought, they will lose the sense of identifying the quality of service for the proletariat, and will become blind designers without direction, and will inevitably be captured by bourgeois ideology and roll into the mud pit of the bourgeois ranks. Therefore, the Party's call for technical workers to advance towards "both red and expert" is particularly important and meaningful for design personnel.

With politics in command, design personnel can be liberated from individualism, empiricism, and dogmatism.

Chairman Mao taught us that politics is the soul, the commander, and the lifeline of all economic work. Through the "double-anti" (anti-waste, anti-conservatism) and "five-strike" (strike at officialdom, arrogance, extravagance, lethargy, and affectation, plus the idea of fame among design personnel) movement launched in early 1958 on the basis of rectification and anti-rightist campaigns, Mao Zedong Thought grasped the design masses, and it exerted unparalleled power in design work. The vast majority of design personnel posted a huge number of dazzling big-character posters, making true self-exposures and criticisms of the designs they had handled, thereby absorbing profound design ideological education. It prompted design personnel to liberate themselves from bourgeois individual fame and gain, from short-sighted empiricism, and from sanctimonious dogmatism, so that they could break through conventions, develop the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act. Therefore, in the two years of the Great Leap Forward, metallurgical design work developed from the stage of elementary school students tracing and holding pens to the direction of being able to independently do creative design, cooperated with the situation of the Great Leap Forward, and completed outstanding tasks. It basically achieved halving the investment (the construction cost of large blast furnaces was reduced by about 36%), doubling the speed, and one person performing the work of three, reversing the passive situation of construction waiting for design, and achieving the requirements of high speed, high output, high quality, and low cost. Especially in the design of small-scale indigenous steelmaking groups, it implemented the policy of combining the central and local authorities, combining large, medium, and small scales, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, which embodied the power of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. In some production technology operations, as well as in indicators such as smelting intensity and utilization index, some amazing and unprecedented records appeared. Of course, in the emergence of new things, it is impossible to have no shortcomings. However, the so-called design quality problems at that time have been promptly overcome. It can be seen that whether design products and work can embody the spirit of the General Line and create the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, the primary factor depends on whether the ideology of the design personnel is politically in command.

Implementing the mass line and launching mass movements can make design work fast, good, and economical.

The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong often teach us that all work must follow the mass line and launch mass movements. This is also the key to achieving high-speed and high-quality design work. However, the question of whether design departments can launch mass movements and whether they should launch mass movements has not been thoroughly resolved in the minds of some design personnel. Some believe that design work is complex mental labor and must rely on experts and authorities; some believe that design can only proceed step by step, following conventions, and that mass movements will disrupt normal order and spoil design work; others believe that the reforms in the Great Leap Forward in the past two years are almost at an end; and still others believe that the work tasks are tight and conflict with mass movements. These metaphysically view things in isolation as static and unchanging, and see the wisdom of the masses and the cause of creating history as something that only a few people do coldly and quietly. This design work exceptionalism has been profoundly and forcefully refuted in the recent mass movement of design work technical performance competitions. This design work performance competition, although starting in the three metallurgical professional design institutes in Anshan in early 1960, immediately set off a high tide of technical performance competitions in various design institutes in the national metallurgical sector, with almost all personnel participating. The movement broke the cumbersome design procedures bound by old rules and regulations, and launched a vigorous and lively variety of performance forms such as experience matching, engineering matching, and large-scale annihilation battles, while also carrying out various reforms of design tools and working methods. Under the leadership of the Party, the masses gave play to collective wisdom, creatively simplified drafting and calculation methods, strengthened collaboration between specialties, reformed design organization and management, and through "learning," "comparing," "catching up," and "helping," were able to train novices to engage in what was previously considered more complex design work, quickly becoming skilled in a short period of time. On the new basis, the speed of various different design work was accelerated by two to ten times, and the quality of design drawings was also guaranteed, basically eliminating the drafting process, freeing design personnel from most of the cumbersome design work, and freeing up more time to undertake more meaningful experimental research, as well as going deep into production and construction sites. The achievements of this movement have changed the entire face of design and are a great revolution in design work, once again proving that under the leadership of the Party, all work must launch mass movements to achieve great victories, and even design, which involves complex mental labor, cannot be an exception.

Vigorously reform design methods and continuously improve design levels.

In various design departments, a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is being deeply unfolded along with the surging tide across the country. Although the design work in the Great Leap Forward in the past two years has achieved great achievements, and the design level has also been greatly improved, the design level is still far behind the developing situation when measured by the requirements of the continuous leap forward in socialist construction. Through technical innovation and technical revolution movements, moving towards mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, and further improving the design level, including improving the design work itself and giving full play to the power of the design products when they are put into production, is still an important central link. We design personnel must make the following efforts:

First of all, we must study Mao Zedong Thought well, and we must achieve the command of Mao Zedong Thought. Because during the period of socialist construction, the class struggle in ideology and consciousness is still long-term and complex, and sometimes very fierce. Therefore, the various forms of the struggle between the two lines in work are essentially a manifestation of class consciousness in the struggle between the two roads. Only by strengthening reliance on the leadership of the Party and striving for self-transformation can we design personnel learn Mao Zedong Thought well, apply it in connection with reality, and arm ourselves in our work. We must continue to liberate our minds with the spirit of continuous revolution, combine daring to think and do with scientific analysis, and give full play to our subjective initiative. We must launch mass movements on a large scale, and we should enthusiastically support, study and summarize, and promote and apply all reasonable suggestions from the masses, and pay close attention to cultivating the growth of new things. We must also use the principle that the superstructure must constantly adapt to the economic base to adjust the organizational management forms of design at any time to promote the development of production. We must also consider the basic conditions of design with the idea of active balance and put forward active design schemes.

Secondly, in terms of business, we must also deeply study the Party and the state's guidelines and policies, implement them in specific work, be good at using the methods of walking on two legs and combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small scales, to complete outstanding designs and achieve the requirements of building the country diligently and frugally and building socialism at high speed. We must also strive to study the latest scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union and socialist countries and other international countries, and combine them with China's national conditions, and study them in light of local conditions and circumstances, and promote them in design. We must also closely combine with reality, earnestly implement the combination of design, production, and construction, and the combination of workers, technicians, and leading cadres, go to factories and mines regularly to participate in production labor, humbly learn from workers, absorb advanced production experience, and at the same time, we must summarize the test situation when the design is put into production, establish pilot projects, absorb the opinions of all aspects of construction and production, improve and improve them, and adopt them in the design.

Finally, we must also take design as the key link and carry out experimental research on a large scale to enrich and develop the theoretical and practical basis of metallurgical design, seize the cutting edge, do a good job in the production design of various rare metals, study various new production processes and new equipment that create new records, and strengthen the comprehensive utilization of various resources. We must also run spare-time education and learning on a large scale, universally improve and cultivate design professionals, and strengthen the design force.

The task of the continuous leap forward in 1960 is great, arduous, and there will certainly be difficulties. Our metallurgical design workers are deeply convinced that holding high the banner of invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a guide for our work, giving full play to the mass spirit of soaring enthusiasm, we will be able to stand at the forefront of the national continuous Great Leap Forward situation, overcome all difficulties, make new contributions in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and outstandingly improve the design level and complete the design tasks of 1960 faster, better, and more economically.

### 冶金设计工作高举毛泽东思想的旗帜持续跃进  袁慧灼代表的发言

    冶金设计工作高举毛泽东思想的旗帜持续跃进
    袁慧灼代表的发言
    我完全同意并拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。
    因为站在冶金设计岗位上工作，虽然我在设计方面接触面仅是局部的，所见到的当然不够全面，但是愿意谈谈所了解的这几年来和大跃进中，设计指导思想，对于大跃进成就的概略情况和今后努力的道路。
    设计工作是政治经济和技术的结纽点，在加强政治观念的同时还要加强政策观点
    冶金企业设计工作，在旧中国是没有的。过去官僚资本主义完全仰赖帝国主义国家的专家，说啥是啥，当然不可避免地按照便利于帝国主义搜刮原料和剥削中国人民的企图而安排设计。即以我今年参加视察所听到的举例：某处在抗日战争时期建设成的炼铜厂，连一块重约二十吨重的大石槽，都是从英国进口来的洋货，所以工人同志们起名为“败家石”。这不但说明了官僚资本主义的半殖民地买办性质，也说明了当时技术人员在技术思想上患软骨病的表现。
    冶金设计队伍是在解放后才建立的，是在党的培养教育下，按照建设社会主义的要求，经过不断批判资产阶级设计思想，才逐步提高思想水平和设计技术水平中壮大起来的。正因为设计工作，是政治经济和技术的结纽点，政策性强，需要通过知识分子的技术人员来做具体工作，因而设计思想问题，更突出地显得重要。早在1953年初，党就抓紧了设计思想工作。当时人民日报社论，曾揭露了几个正在建设的厂矿，由于错误的资产阶级设计思想，造成不良的后果，大喊一声地使得设计人员初步受到了设计思想教育。嗣后设计水平的逐步提高，和党经常对设计人员做思想教育，促使设计人员不断地努力自我改造，是分不开的。就设计人员日常一般接触的工作来说，虽然表现为技术问题，但是，如果他缺乏无产阶级政治思想为指导，他就会失去鉴别为无产阶级服务质量的嗅觉，就会变成为没有方向的盲目设计者，亦必然会被资产阶级思想所俘虏，滚到资产阶级队伍的泥坑里去。所以党号召技术工作者向“又红又专”进军，对设计人员来说，更显得特别重要，有深切的意义。
    政治挂帅，设计人员才能从个人主义、经验主义、教条主义中解放出来
    毛主席教导我们，政治是灵魂，是统帅，是一切经济工作的生命线。通过了1958年初，在整风反右派基础上展开的双反（反浪费、反保守）五打（打官、骄、阔、暮、娇五气，外加设计人员的名气思想）运动，毛泽东思想掌握了设计群众，就发挥了设计工作方面无比的威力。绝大部分设计人员贴出巨大数量琳琅满目的大字报，对自己经手设计，作出了真实的自我揭发和批判，从而吸取了深刻的设计思想教育。促使设计人员从资产阶级个人名利思想中解放出来，从目光短浅的经验主义中解放出来，从道貌岸然的教条主义中解放出来，才能打破清规戒律，发扬敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，因而在大跃进的两年中，冶金设计工作，从描红把笔的小学生阶段，走向能创造性地独立做设计方向发展，配合了大跃进的形势，完成了出色的任务。基本做到投资省一半（大型高炉建设费降低约36％），速度加两番，人力一顶三，扭转了过去施工等设计的被动局面，达到了高速、多产、优质、低成本的要求。尤其在钢铁小洋群设计方面，贯彻了中央与地方并举，大中小并举，土洋并举的方针，体现了总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝的威力。在某些生产技术操作方面，以及冶炼强度和利用指数等指标，出现了若干惊人的史无前例的纪录。当然在新事物产生中不可能没有一个指头的缺点的。但是当时所谓设计质量问题，都已及时地加以克服。可见设计成品和工作，能否体现总路线精神和创造大跃进成绩，首要的因素，决定于设计人员思想是否政治挂帅。
    贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动，设计工作就可以多快好省
    党和毛泽东同志经常教导我们，一切工作必须走群众路线和大搞群众运动。这也是实现设计工作高速优质的关键。但是部分设计人员思想中对设计部门能不能大搞群众运动，应不应大搞群众运动，还不是彻底解决的事。有的认为设计工作是复杂的脑力劳动，必须依靠专家和权威；有的认为设计只能按部就班，循着常规办事，群众运动会打乱正常秩序，会把设计工作搞糟；也有认为二年来大跃进中的改革，已经差不多到头；还有认为工作任务紧，与群众运动有矛盾。这些形而上学地把事物孤立地看成静止不变，把群众的智慧和创造历史的事业，看成是少数人冷冷清清的事。这样的设计工作特殊论，在最近出现的设计工作技术表演赛的群众运动中，受到了深刻有力的反驳。这次设计工作的表演赛，虽然于1960年初在鞍山的三个冶金专业设计院开始，随即在全国冶金部门各个设计院，风起云涌地掀起几乎全部人员都参加的技术表演赛的高潮。运动中打破了为旧规章制度束缚下的繁琐设计程序，展开了轰轰烈烈的经验配套、工程配套、大打歼灭战等各种表演形式，同时进行了设计工具和工作方法的各项改革。群众在党的领导下，发挥了集体智慧，创造性地简化了制图和计算方法；加强了专业之间的协作；改革了设计组织和管理；通过了“学”“比”“赶”“帮”，能够训练新手，从事已往所谓比较复杂的设计工作，短期内很快成为熟手。在新的基础上，又加快了各种不同设计工作的速度二倍至十倍，还保证了设计图纸的质量，基本上消灭了描图工序，使设计人员从大部分繁琐的设计工作中解放出来，腾出更多的时间，担任更有意义的试验研究，以及深入生产和施工现场工作。这次运动的成就，改变了全部设计面貌，是设计工作的大革命，再一次证明党的领导，一切工作必须大搞群众运动才能获得伟大的胜利，即使从事复杂脑力劳动的设计，也不可能是例外的。
    大力改革设计方法，不断提高设计水平
    在各个设计部门中，正在随着全国声势澎湃的热潮，深入地展开技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。两年来大跃进中的设计工作，虽已取得伟大的成就，设计水平也有飞跃的提高，但是以社会主义建设持续跃进的要求来衡量设计水平，还远落后于发展形势。通过技术革新和技术革命运动，走向机械化半机械化和自动化半自动化，进一步提高设计水平，包括改进设计工作本身和发挥设计成品投产时的威力，还是重要的中心环节。我们设计人员必须进行下列各项的努力：
    首先，我们必须好好学习毛泽东思想，必须做到以毛泽东思想挂帅。由于在社会主义建设时期，思想意识上的阶级斗争，还是长期的复杂的，有时还是很激烈的。因此，在工作中两条路线斗争的各种形式，实质上还往往是两条道路斗争阶级意识的表现，我们设计人员，只有加强依靠党的领导，努力自我改造，才能够学好毛泽东思想，联系到实际应用，在工作中武装自己。我们必须以不断革命论精神，继续解放思想，把敢想敢做和科学分析相结合，充分发挥主观能动性。我们必须大搞群众运动，对群众一切合理建议，应当热情地加以支持，加以研究总结，加以推广应用，密切注意培养新生事物的生长。还须运用上层建筑必须不断与经济基础相适应的原理，随时调整设计组织管理形式来促进发展生产。还须以积极平衡思想来考虑设计基础条件，提出富于积极性的设计方案。
    其次，在业务方面我们还须深入钻研党和国家的方针政策，贯彻到具体工作里，善于运用两条腿走路和土洋并举，大中小并举等方针，完成杰出的设计，达到勤俭建国和高速度建设社会主义的要求。我们还须努力学习苏联和社会主义国家以及其他国际最新科学技术成就结合中国国情，因地制宜，因时适用地研究，在设计中推广。我们还须密切结合实际，切实执行设计、生产、施工三结合，工人、技术人员、领导干部三结合，定期去厂矿参加生产劳动，虚心向工人学习，吸取先进生产经验，同时还须总结设计投产时考验情况，建立试点，吸收施工和生产各方面的意见，加以改进提高，采用到设计中去。
    最后，我们还必须以设计为纲，大搞试验研究，来充实和发展冶金设计中理论和实践的基础，攻占尖端，做好各种稀有金属的生产设计，钻研各项创造新纪录的新生产流程和新的设备，加强综合利用各项资源。还必须大办业余教育学习，普遍提高并培养设计专业人才，壮大设计力量。
    1960年的持续跃进的任务是伟大的，艰巨的，困难肯定是有的。我们冶金设计工作者深信，高举无往不胜的毛泽东思想旗帜为工作指导，发挥群众性的冲天干劲，必能站在全国持续大跃进形势的前列，克服一切困难，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，做出新的贡献，出色地提高设计水平，更多快好省地完成1960年的设计任务。
