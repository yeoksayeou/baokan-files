I wholeheartedly endorse the reports by the two Deputy Premiers on the draft national economic plan for 1960, the 1959 national financial statement, and the draft national budget for 1960, and will conscientiously implement the spirit of the reports in my own work. I fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC and support the proposed future work opinions, and I am grateful for the brilliant achievements made by the Standing Committee under the leadership of Chairman Zhou Enlai. I fully support Deputy Premier Tan's report on realizing the National Agricultural Development Program and will take on the tasks that heavy industry should undertake to support agriculture. In the two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, under the correct and wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we have achieved unprecedented accomplishments on all fronts of socialist construction. We have not only completed the various targets for 1959, but also completed the targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. We have not only achieved the speed of the Great Leap Forward in the economic sector, but also achieved amazing development in science, education, culture, sports, and health. These achievements and developments are not only high-speed and proportionate, but will also be sustained in the long term. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction. It is the concrete manifestation of the urgent desire of 650 million people under the leadership of the Party to rapidly change the state of "poverty and blankness" and build the motherland into a powerful socialist country.

I am a petroleum industry worker and a lover and promoter of the comprehensive utilization of solid combustible minerals. I fully support the arrangements for the national petroleum industry and coal industry in Deputy Premier Li Fuchun's report. Deputy Premier Li clearly pointed out that in addition to continuing to vigorously build large-scale natural oil and synthetic oil industries, the state will actively build small and medium-sized synthetic petroleum plants, and will also, according to resources and other conditions, establish simple coal oil refining plants in local areas and people's communes. This is the most brilliant way to implement the principles of adapting to local conditions, using local materials, self-reliance, and vigorously running "small, indigenous, and foreign," "small foreign groups," or a combination of foreign and indigenous enterprises, to rapidly increase crude oil production and support the technological transformation of agriculture. The technological transformation of agriculture this year will require an increase of more than 5 million horsepower of power machinery. If these machines are driven by internal combustion engines, an additional 2.4 million tons of gasoline and diesel fuel will be required each year to fully meet the needs of these power sources. At the same time, these needs are decentralized and diversified. Therefore, rapidly establishing small and medium-sized crude oil production points that are adapted to local conditions and self-reliant to meet the needs of agriculture and regions is a paramount task. Deputy Premier Li's report proposes the rational distribution of coal production, which not only reduces the burden of transporting coal from the north to the south, but also complements the work of establishing small coal oil refining plants in various regions and communes. Will doing so increase the burden on coal production? By how much will it increase? This must be determined based on the methods used. If the gasification synthesis production method is used, 15 million tons of anthracite or semi-coke will be required to produce 2.4 million tons of synthetic petroleum products. If the low-temperature distillation method is used, about 30 million tons of non-caking or weakly caking bituminous coal will be required, but 20 million tons of semi-coke and the equivalent of 1.5 million tons of net surplus gas can also be produced as by-products. The synthesis method uses more raw materials, but the raw materials are anthracite or semi-coke produced as a by-product of low-temperature distillation. At the same time, among the finished products produced, there are more chemical products and more gasoline, with gasoline accounting for about 30% and chemical products accounting for about 40%. If the chemical products produced use grain as raw materials, more than 5 million tons of grain will be consumed, which is a very large figure. Therefore, the choice of these two methods must be determined according to the needs of raw materials and products, adapting to local conditions. As for the entire nation's petroleum industry policy, under the diligent and strong leadership of the Party group and leadership of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, every effort is being made to resolutely and bravely implement it. We have every reason to firmly believe that under the shining light of the ever-victorious General Line, removing the label of backwardness in the petroleum industry and leaping into the ranks of the world's most advanced petroleum industries will definitely be achieved before the completion of the Third Five-Year Plan!

In studying the reports of the Deputy Premiers, I have realized that the current situation is infinitely bright. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces are constantly and rationally resolved, stimulating the enthusiasm of the entire people to build socialism, liberating their minds, and cultivating the noble character of communism, selflessness, and large-scale cooperation. Therefore, we are bound to move forward at an unabated high speed. At the same time, I have a deeper understanding that the revolutionary cause led by the Party is extraordinarily great and arduous. To raise the lives of 650 million people and a country that has been plagued by poverty and disease from "poverty and blankness" to the most advanced level of society with abundant food and clothing, prosperity and happiness, is not an easy task. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party, after countless revolutionary struggles and the sacrifice of countless outstanding sons and daughters, and after the destruction of the exploitative regime, do we have the opportunity today to realize this lofty ideal. Therefore, we must cherish this opportunity, adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to the mass line, listen to the Party, and be a docile tool of the Party. We must throw ourselves into the great mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, seize every opportunity, and dedicate all our strength to the Party's revolutionary cause.

    为发展石油工业献出力量
    赵宗燠委员的发言
    我衷心拥护两位副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案、1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告并在自己工作中认真贯彻报告的精神。我完全同意政协常务委员会的工作报告和拥护所提出的今后工作意见，并感谢常务委员会在周恩来主席领导下所作出的辉煌成绩。我完全拥护谭副总理关于实现农业发展纲要的报告，并要负起重工业支援农业自己应作的任务。在两年连续大跃进中在党和毛主席的正确英明领导下我们取得了社会主义建设各个战线上史无前例的成就，不仅完成了1959年的各项指标，而且提前完成了第二个五年计划指标，不仅在经济部门取得了大跃进的速度，同时在科学、教育、文化、体育、卫生事业上也得到了惊人的发展。这些成就和发展不仅是高速度，按比例，而且是必将长期的持续下去。这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是在党的领导下六亿五千万人民要求迅速改变“一穷二白”的状况，把祖国建成一个强大的社会主义国家的迫切愿望的具体表现。
    我是一个石油工业工作者和固体可燃矿物综合利用工业的热爱者和促进者，我完全拥护李富春副总理报告中对国家石油工业和煤炭工业的安排，李副总理明确指出国家除了继续大力建设天然油及人造油大洋群工业外，将积极建设中小型人造石油厂，还将根据资源和其他条件在地方和人民公社举办简易煤炼油厂，这是贯彻因地制宜，就地取材，自力更生，大办“小土洋”，“小洋群”，或洋土结合企业，以迅速增加原油产量，支援农业技术改造的最英明的办法，农业技术改造今年要增加五百多万马力的动力机械，如果这些机械要用内燃机带动，每年将增加二百四十万吨汽油和柴油，才能充分满足这些动力的需要，同时这些需要是分散而多样化的，因此迅速建立因地制宜，自力更生的中小型原油生产点，以满足农业和地区的需要，是当前的无尚要图，李副总理的报告中提出了煤炭生产的合理分布，这不仅减少了北煤南运的负担，同时更配合了在各地区及公社建立小型煤炼油厂的工作开展。这样做是不是会增加煤炭生产的负担呢？增加的数量多少？这要根据采用的方法来确定，如果采用气化合成的生产方法，将需要无烟煤，或半焦炭一千五百万吨来生产二百四十万吨的合成石油产品，如果采用低温干馏方法，将需不粘结或微粘结的烟煤约三千万吨，但还可以副产半焦炭二千万吨，和相当于一百五十万吨煤的净余煤气。合成法用原料较多，但原料是无烟煤或低温干馏副产的半焦，同时所产的成品中，化工产品多和汽油多，汽油约30％，化工品约40％，所产的化工品如果以粮食为原料，将消耗五百多万吨粮食，这是一个十分浩大的数字。因此这两个方法的选择要根据原料和产品需要来因地制宜加以决定。至于整个国家的石油工业政策，正在由石油工业部部党组和部领导的勤奋坚强领导之下，千方百计，沉着英勇贯彻中，我们有十分的根据坚信，在无往而不胜的总路线光辉照耀下，摘下石油工业落后帽子，一跃而进入世界最先进的石油工业行列，在第三个五年计划完成前是一定能办到的！
    在学习各位副总理的报告中，我认识到当前的形势无限美好，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，不断地合理地解决了生产关系与生产力之间的矛盾，激发了全体人民的建设社会主义热情，解放了思想，培养了共产主义舍己为人大协作的高尚品格，因此我们是一定能用毫不稍衰的高速度向前迈进的。但同时我更深刻的体会到，党领导的革命事业是异常伟大而艰巨的。要把六亿五千万人民的生活和一个已往贫病交侵的国家，由“一穷二白”提高到丰衣足食，富强康乐的最先进的社会水平，不是一件轻而易举的事。只有在共产党领导下，经过了无数的革命斗争，牺牲了无数的优秀儿女，摧毁了剥削政权之后，才得到今天实现这个崇高理想的机会。因此我们要十分珍惜这个时机，坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线，听党的话，作党的驯服工具。投身于当前的技术革新和技术革命的伟大群众运动之中，争取点滴机会，为党的革命事业献出自己一切力量。
