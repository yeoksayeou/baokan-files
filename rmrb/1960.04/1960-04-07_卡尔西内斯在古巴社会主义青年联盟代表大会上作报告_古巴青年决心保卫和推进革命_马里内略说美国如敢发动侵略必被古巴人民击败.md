Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 5th -- The Fourth Congress of the Cuban Socialist Youth League opened last night in the midst of slogans such as "Swear to Defend the Motherland," "Long Live Free Cuba," and "Down with U.S. Imperialism." This is the first national congress held by the Youth League since the victory of the Cuban Revolution.

Ramon Carcines, Secretary-General of the Cuban Socialist Youth League, said when announcing the opening of the congress that the purpose of convening this congress is to mobilize all the strength of the Cuban youth and the Cuban people to defend the threatened national sovereignty, to create the best conditions for resisting and crushing the aggression of U.S. imperialism, and to redouble efforts to help the revolutionary government.

On the rostrum were members of the National Executive Bureau of the Cuban People's Socialist Party and the National Committee of the Socialist Youth League, fraternal delegations from groups such as the 26th of July Movement, the Revolutionary Directorate, the United Front of Revolutionary Youth, and the Federation of Cuban University Students. Also on the rostrum were youth delegations from Canada, China, Chile, France, Romania, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Venezuela, the United States, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Spain ,and Dominica who were invited to attend the congress.

The venue was decorated with portraits of Cuban national hero Jose Marti, Cuban Prime Minister Castro, and Cuban People's Socialist Party leaders Juan Marinello and Blas Roca.

Juan Marinello, Chairman of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, said in his speech at the opening ceremony that the Cuban Revolution has aroused opposition from traitors, especially the U.S. monopoly groups and the U.S. government. He said that those divisionists who attempt to raise the banner of religion and anti-communism are serving them. He said that Cuba respects all religions, but this is not a conflict between man and God, but a conflict between revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries. Inciting anti-communism is not only against communists, but also against the Cuban Revolution. Whoever creates division is betraying the motherland. Marinello pointed out the possibility of a foreign-instigated invasion, emphasizing that if an enemy invasion occurs, it will certainly be defeated by the heroic struggle of the Cuban people, who have the support of the people of Latin America and the world.

National leaders of the Cuban 26th of July Movement and the Revolutionary Directorate also spoke at the meeting, emphasizing that those who fought together in the past are still together now fighting to defend the revolutionary regime.

Representatives from various countries who were invited to attend the congress stated in their speeches that their people support the Cuban Revolution. Antonio García Ponce, Secretary-General of the Communist Youth League of Venezuela, emphasized that the Cuban Revolution is a huge support for the revolutionary struggles of the Latin American people. The Venezuelan youth are at the disposal of the Cuban revolutionary youth to fight to defend the Cuban Revolution against imperialist aggression. Drezydenko, representative of the Soviet Leninist Communist Youth League, said that the Soviet youth and his country stand with Cuba and the Cuban Revolution. Guy Chauffour, representative of the French Communist Youth League, strongly condemned the recent destruction of the "La Coubre" ship by imperialism. This ship explosion caused suffering to both Cubans and French people. The French representative expressed his respect for the Cuban revolutionary government's assistance to the families of the French victims. He emphasized that the French and Cuban people are fighting against the common enemy of imperialism.

Telegrams of support from Polish, Korean, Jordanian and Guinean youth organizations, as well as congratulatory messages from various Cuban people's groups, were also read out at the opening ceremony.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 5th -- Ramon Carcines, Secretary-General of the Cuban Socialist Youth League, said at the first working session of the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Youth League today that the U.S. imperialists are the direct organizers of the impending aggression against Cuba. Like all revolutionary youth in Cuba, members of the Cuban Socialist Youth League vow to fight to the last inch of land in the battle against the aggressors to defend the motherland, and would rather die than be defeated.

Carcines delivered a report on the first item on the agenda at today's meeting, entitled "Activities of the Socialist Youth League Since the Third Congress and the Tasks of Cuban Youth in Defending the Revolution." The 600 delegates attending the meeting responded to his report with continuous warm applause and cheers. Carcines pointed out in his report that the obligation of Cuban patriotic youth is to join the militia and learn to master weapons in order to fight alongside the Rebel Army to crush the U.S. aggressors. He said that Cuban youth are not the enemy of the American people, but resolute fighters against foreign aggressors.

Carcines emphasized that the Cuban Socialist Youth League firmly supports the revolutionary government. Its central slogan is: Defend the revolutionary government, defend the revolution, and advance the revolution. The revolution has given youth a free and independent country, and Cuban youth proudly defend it, destroying the anti-people repressive machinery.

Carcines expressed enthusiastic support for the revolutionary measures taken by the revolutionary government, and called on young workers to further assist the revolutionary government, contribute to the development of state-owned enterprises, and produce well and economically. He called on young farmers to cooperate more actively with the National Institute of Agrarian Reform to carry out land reform. He also called on young students to use their knowledge to serve the government's national development plan.

Carcines expressed support for the Cuban government's policies of peace, friendship, non-alignment, and trade with all countries. He said that the Cuban-Soviet Joint Communiqué is a brilliant embodiment of this policy.

The reporter reviewed the heroic struggle of the Socialist Youth League against the Batista tyranny since the Third Congress during ten years of illegality, and its contributions to participating in and effectively supporting the revolutionary war of the Rebel Army. The reporter praised the work of the Socialist Youth League's publication "Mella" magazine, which had been published underground in the past.

Carcines finally called on the members of the Youth League to continuously strengthen unity with all revolutionary youth forces. He said that the Socialist Youth League supports the idea of organizing a youth organization that unites all revolutionary forces in Cuba to defend and advance the revolution. The Socialist Youth League is prepared to have its members participate in this organization in their individual capacity.

The attendees all stood up and cheered Major Iglesias, the youngest major in the Rebel Army, who received this rank at the age of sixteen for his bravery in battle. The congress will discuss Carcines' report tomorrow.

    据新华社哈瓦那5日电　古巴社会主义青年联盟第四次代表大会昨天晚上在“誓死保卫祖国”、“自由古巴万岁”和“打倒美帝国主义”的口号声中开幕。这是青年联盟在古巴革命胜利后举行的第一次全国代表大会。
    古巴社会主义青年联盟总书记拉蒙·卡尔西内斯在宣布大会开幕时说，召开这次代表大会是为了把古巴青年和古巴人民的一切力量都动员起来，保卫受到威胁的国家主权，是为抗击和粉碎美帝国主义的侵略创造最好的条件，并且加倍努力地帮助革命政府。
    在主席台上的有古巴人民社会党全国执行局和社会主义青年联盟全国委员会的委员、7月26日运动、革命指导委员会、起义青年联合会和古巴大学生联合会等团体的兄弟代表团，在主席台上还有应邀参加大会的加拿大、中国、智利、法国、罗马尼亚、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、委内瑞拉、美国、尼加拉瓜、哥斯达黎加、西班牙和多米尼加的青年代表团。

    古巴人民社会党主席胡安·马里内略在开幕式上致词时说，古巴革命激起了卖国分子、特别是美国垄断集团和美国政府的反对。他说，那些企图打起宗教和反共旗号的分裂主义分子是为他们效劳的。他说，古巴尊重一切宗教；但是这里不是人和上帝的冲突，而是革命者和反革命分子的冲突。煽动反共不仅是反对共产党人，也是反对古巴革命。谁搞分裂，谁就是背叛祖国。马里内略指出了发生在外国策动下的入侵的可能性，他强调指出，如果发生了敌人的入侵，它一定会被得到拉丁美洲和世界各国人民支持的古巴人的英勇斗争所击败。
    在会上讲话的还有古巴7月26日运动和革命指导委员会的全国领导人，他们强调指出，过去一起作过战的人现在仍在一起为保卫革命政权而斗争。
    应邀参加大会的各国代表在发言时表示：他们的人民支持古巴革命。委内瑞拉共产主义青年联盟总书记安东尼奥·加西亚·庞塞强调指出，古巴革命是对拉丁美洲人民革命斗争的巨大支持。委内瑞拉青年听候古巴革命青年的调遣，为保卫古巴革命反对帝国主义侵略而战。苏联列宁共产主义青年团代表德累兹坚科说，苏联青年和他的国家都和古巴及古巴革命站在一起。法兰西共产主义青年联盟代表果伊·沙福强烈谴责了帝国主义不久前对“勒库布尔号”轮船的破坏。这次轮船爆炸事件使古巴人和法国人受难。这位法国代表对古巴革命政府给予法国遇难者家属以援助表示敬意。他强调指出，法国人民和古巴人民在为反对共同的敌人帝国主义而斗争。
    在开幕式上，还宣读了波兰、朝鲜、约旦和几内亚青年组织表示支援的电报和古巴各人民团体的贺词。
    据新华社哈瓦那5日电　古巴社会主义青年联盟总书记拉蒙·卡尔西内斯今天在社会主义青年联盟第四次代表大会的第一次工作会议上说，美帝国主义者是正在准备中的对古巴的侵略的直接组织者。像古巴全体革命青年一样，古巴社会主义青年联盟的盟员宣誓：在反对侵略者的战斗中为保卫祖国而寸土必争，不胜利毋宁死。
    卡尔西内斯在今天的会议上就会议的第一项议程做了报告，题目是“社会主义青年联盟第三次代表大会以来的活动和古巴青年保卫革命的任务”。参加会议的六百名代表对他所作的报告不断报以热烈的掌声和欢呼。卡尔西内斯在报告中指出，古巴爱国青年的义务是参加民兵和学习掌握武器，以便同起义军一起为粉碎美国侵略者而斗争。他说，古巴青年不是美国人民的敌人，而是反对外国侵略者的坚决战士。
    卡尔西内斯强调指出，古巴社会主义青年联盟坚决支持革命政府。它的中心口号是：保卫革命政府，保卫革命和推进革命。革命给了青年一个自由自主的国家，古巴青年骄傲地保卫着它，他们摧毁了反人民的镇压机器。
    卡尔西内斯表示热烈支持革命政府所采取的革命措施，他号召青年工人更多地帮助革命政府，为国家企业的发展作出贡献，生产得又好又省。他号召青年农民更加积极地同土地改革全国委员会合作，来进行土地改革。他还号召青年学生用他们的知识为政府的全国发展计划服务。
    卡尔西内斯表示支持古巴政府采取的和平、友好、不参加集团以及同各个国家进行贸易的政策。他说，古巴苏联联合公报就是这一政策的光辉体现。
    报告人回顾了社会主义青年联盟自从第三次代表大会以来在长达十年的处于非法地位的年代中为反对巴蒂斯塔暴政而进行的英勇斗争，以及在参加和有效地支援起义军的革命战争中所作的贡献。报告人称赞了社会主义青年联盟机关刊物“梅利亚”杂志的工作，这个杂志过去一直在地下出版。
    卡尔西内斯最后号召青年联盟的盟员不断地加强同一切革命青年力量之间的团结。他说，社会主义青年联盟赞成组织这样一个青年组织的主张，这个组织要团结古巴的一切革命力量来保卫革命和推进革命。社会主义青年联盟准备使它的盟员以个人身份参加这个组织。
    与会者全体起立，向参加大会的伊格莱西亚斯少校欢呼，他是起义军中最年青的少校，这个军衔是他在十六岁时由于在战斗中表现出的勇敢而获得的。代表大会明天将讨论卡尔西内斯的报告。
