Strengthen Leadership and Promote Spring Production

Xinjiang Develops Production Along Railways
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Party Committee, in order to further strengthen leadership over agricultural production in the areas along the railways, including Hami, Changji, Turpan, Shanshan, Toksun, Usu, and Shawan, has decided that each system at the autonomous region level will adopt the method of assigning responsibility to specific counties, comprehensively assisting the counties in managing people's communes well and accelerating the realization of agricultural technical transformation. At present, 1,158 cadres have been transferred from agencies at the autonomous region level to work in various counties to assist in carrying out spring plowing and production.

Yunnan Sends Out Spring Plowing Inspection Teams
The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee recently formed inspection teams and dispatched them to various regions to inspect spring plowing and production, focusing on drought resistance.

The main contents of this inspection are: drought resistance, late-stage management of minor spring crops, and preparation for major spring planting. At the same time, the inspection will also examine the arrangements for the masses' lives, focusing on running public canteens well. Through inspection, problems will be discovered, resolved, and experiences will be exchanged to promote mutual progress.

The inspection team is headed by Yan Hongyan, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, as the head of the entire delegation.

Intercropping Sesame in Sweet Potato Fields Increases Oil Yield
The Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a circular to all parts of the country regarding the experience of Shilipu and Shantoudian Communes in Henan Province in intercropping sesame in sweet potato fields, considering this method to be very good and requiring all regions to learn and promote this experience to increase oil production.

The experience of Shilipu Commune and Shantoudian Commune in Xiangcheng County proves that by intercropping sesame in sweet potato fields, the yield of sweet potatoes is basically not reduced, and each mu can also yield a net increase of 40 to 50 jin of sesame. This year, the Xiangcheng County Party Committee decided that all of the county's 200,000 mu of spring and summer-sown sweet potatoes will be intercropped with sesame. Calculated on the basis of intercropping one row of sesame between three rows of sweet potatoes, the county can increase sesame production by 10 million jin, which can be used to extract 3.5 million jin of oil. The entire county will average eight jin per person. In addition, 6.5 million jin of good fertilizer, sesame cake, can be obtained.

The Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture believes that intercropping sesame in sweet potato fields is a good way to increase oil production because sweet potatoes require more potassium fertilizer, while sesame requires more nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer. Intercropping can improve the utilization rate of fertilizers and fully exert their effectiveness.

Henan Builds Large Numbers of Mechanical Irrigation and Drainage Stations
In the struggle against drought, mountainous and hilly areas of Henan Province are building a large number of machine wells and mechanical irrigation and drainage stations. By mid-March, 2,470 irrigation and drainage stations had been built throughout the province, of which more than 1,400 had been used to irrigate more than 4 million mu of wheat. In addition, more than 2,000 mechanical irrigation and drainage stations are under construction.

Guangdong Establishes Agricultural Demonstration Zone
The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee has decided to build Guangzhou suburban area, Foshan suburban area, Nanhai, Panyu, Shunde, Huaxian, Conghua, Zengcheng and other eight counties (suburban areas) around Guangzhou into a demonstration zone and agricultural product commodity base for modern agriculture. This demonstration zone will achieve semi-mechanization and partial mechanization this year, and basically achieve mechanization and electrification by 1962.

According to the provincial party committee's plan, the state will supply the demonstration zone with the necessary number of tractors, electric plows, trucks, electric boats, power and power generation equipment, and chemical fertilizers according to plan.

    加强领导　促进春季生产
    新疆发展铁路沿线生产
    新疆维吾尔自治区党委为了进一步加强对铁路沿线哈密、昌吉和吐鲁番、鄯善、托克逊、乌苏、沙湾等地区农业生产的领导，决定自治区一级各系统采取分片包县的办法，具体地全面地协助各该县办好人民公社，加速实现农业技术改造。现在自治区一级机关已抽调干部一千一百五十八人分赴各县工作，协助开展春耕生产。
    云南派出春耕检查团
    中共云南省委最近组成检查团，分赴各地区检查以抗旱为中心的春耕生产。
    这次检查的主要内容是：抗旱、小春后期管理、大春栽插的准备等。同时还将检查以办好公共食堂为中心的安排群众生活的情况。通过检查，发现问题，解决问题，交流经验，互相促进。
    检查团由省委第一书记阎红彦担任总团长。
    红薯间作芝麻增产油料
    农业部最近就河南省推广十里铺和山头店两公社在红薯地间种芝麻的经验，向全国各地发出通报，认为这个办法很好，要求各地学习推广这一经验，增产更多的油料。
    襄城县十里铺公社和山头店公社的经验证明，实行红薯芝麻间作，红薯基本不少收，每亩还可净增产芝麻四、五十斤。今年襄城县县委决定，全县二十余万亩春夏播红薯，全部间作芝麻，以三行红薯间种一行芝麻计算，全县可增产一千万斤芝麻，可榨油三百五十万斤，全县每人平均八斤。此外，还可得很好的肥料芝麻饼六百五十万斤。
    河南省农业厅认为，实行红薯芝麻间作，是一项增产油料的好办法，因为红薯和芝麻这两种作物，一个需要钾肥较多，一个需要氮肥和磷肥较多，而实行间作，就可以提高肥料的利用率，充分发挥肥效。
    河南大建机械排灌站
    河南省的山区和丘陵地区在抗旱斗争中，一面大打机井，一面大建机械排灌站。到3月中旬，全省已经建成二千四百七十处排灌站，其中有一千四百多处，已经用以浇麦四百多万亩；另外还有二千多处机械排灌站，正在施工兴建。
    广东建设农业示范区
    中共广东省委决定把广州市周围的广州市郊、佛山市郊、南海、番禺、顺德、花县、从化、增城等八个县（市郊）建成一个现代化农业的示范区和农产品商品基地。这个示范区要在今年实现半机械化和部分机械化，到1962年基本实现机械化和电气化。
    根据省委的规划，对这个示范区国家将按计划供应必要数量的拖拉机、电犁、载重汽车、电船、电力和发电设备、化学肥料。
