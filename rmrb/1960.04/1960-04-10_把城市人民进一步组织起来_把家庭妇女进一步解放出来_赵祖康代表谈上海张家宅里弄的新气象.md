Chairman, fellow representatives:

　　After listening to the reports made by the central leaders, reviewing the brilliant achievements of the motherland in the past two years, and looking forward to the bright and happy socialist and communist future, I feel infinite joy and encouragement. I fully support these reports. As a member of a democratic party working in Shanghai, looking back at the profound changes in Shanghai in the past two years, especially in the past year, and recently participating in some inspection activities in Shanghai, I saw the new joyful scenes of women in urban lanes actively participating in collective labor and collective life, which gave me a profound education. I am particularly excited and deeply understand the great power of the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and the profound greatness of Mao Zedong Thought. Here, I would like to report to the conference some observations and thoughts on the work of one lane, and I would appreciate criticism and correction from the representatives if there is anything inappropriate.

　　Profound Changes

　　The work of organizing production, life, and education collectivization in Zhangjiazhai Lane, Jing'an District, is outstanding in Shanghai and a red flag unit in the country. There are currently more than 3,000 households and more than 12,800 people, of which 94.5% are working people. In addition to the workers and cadres who are employed and children under the age of sixteen, there are still more than 2,000 people, most of whom are housewives. In September 1958, under the impetus of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production across the country and the vigorous emergence of rural people's communes, the women in this area, under the leadership of the Party, were quickly further organized, underwent profound changes, and made achievements.

　　First of all, in terms of labor production, more than 400 women are now participating, with seven processing and production groups, including lightning arresters, capacitors, sewing, embroidery, and medicine packaging, all serving production and socialist construction, and creating material wealth for the country. According to the statistics of several production groups, in the past year or so, they have processed 275,000 lightning arresters, more than 1,200 capacitors, more than 23,000 electromagnetic telephone handles, more than 80,000 other electrical parts, more than 11,259 pieces of sewn clothing, and more than 800 boxes of packaged medicine for factories. The processing fees alone amounted to 140,000 yuan. At the same time, they successively organized participation in the construction of railways and highways, and temporary labor in factories, shops, and rural areas. In addition, the 644 households in this lane provided 47,000 catties of rice浆 (rice water) and more than 100,000 catties of "泔脚" (swill) to the countryside in less than a year, powerfully supporting agricultural production.

　　Secondly, in terms of handling collective welfare and improving living standards, many undertakings have been launched, including public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, lactation rooms, and medical and health stations. In addition to receiving wages, women participating in labor enjoy various preferential treatments in terms of welfare. During the inspection, we saw a public canteen that provides food for 700 people, some of whom are from nearby factories and institutions who "join the meals." Every morning, they provide steamed buns, vegetable buns, pastries, pancakes, and fried dough sticks, etc. The dishes for each meal cost five cents, one dime, and two dimes, which the masses are very satisfied with. It is understood that there are six similar canteens with more than 70 staff members, providing meals for 3,600 people. We also saw a nursery, kindergarten, and lactation room, with more than 20 classes in total. Almost all children under the age of seven of the working people are enrolled in classes, and the fees are very low.

　　When the organization decided to distribute wages for the first time after the lane women participated in labor, they all said they didn't need them. After a meeting and discussion, the method of "self-reporting and mutual evaluation" was decided before they were persuaded. And when they received their wages, they were overjoyed. Many people bought portraits of Chairman Mao and national flags and hung them in their living rooms, as if they were celebrating a happy event.

　　Thirdly, in terms of social services, in the past two years, Zhangjiazhai has gradually developed from starting a life service station to comprehensively organizing the economic life of the people. This is because as production and labor are increasingly developed and the masses' lives are constantly improving, it is no longer enough to only run collective welfare undertakings centered on public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens to meet the diverse needs of workers and working women. Now, the number of people in the comprehensive service station has grown to 61, and the scope of services is very wide, giving us a very deep impression. The station is divided into various departments, and we saw a barber shop, a laundry, a repair group, a waste recycling station, and an agency service office. In the repair group, we saw the repair and mending of various daily necessities and clothing, such as repairing washbasins, repairing rubber shoes, sewing buttons, mending clothes, and renovating clothes. In the agency service station, we saw agency banking savings, postal and telecommunications services, agency payment of water and electricity bills, and agency purchase of boat tickets, etc. The service station also handles the sale of旺煤球 (brisket coal briquettes),代烧泡饭 (cooking rice porridge),倒便桶 (emptying chamber pots),编结绒线衣 (knitting woolen sweaters),收拾房舍 (cleaning up houses),接送儿童 (picking up and dropping off children),服侍产妇、老人、病人 (taking care of lying-in women, the elderly, and patients), and even 代管全部家务 (managing all household chores), achieving "doing whatever is asked, being available whenever called, being flexible and convenient for the masses." Therefore, the scope of services is also very wide. It serves 485 households, or more than 15% of the total number of households, with door-to-door services for employees and elderly and disabled residents. During the inspection, the person in charge of the lane said that a women's bathroom is also being built and will be opened the next day, and a lane-run vegetable market is also being planned.

　　Fourthly, in terms of culture, education, and health, after housewives embarked on the road of collectivization, not only their material lives have improved, but they have also made significant progress in popularizing culture and education, and sports and health have also been done well. Housewives have now all shed their illiterate status. The lane has successively opened private primary schools with more than 400 students and a civic spare-time middle school with more than 600 students, the oldest of whom are more than 50 years old. Before liberation, not a single child of the working people in Zhangjiazhai had ever attended university. After liberation, it was completely different. Now, more than 500 people are studying in universities across the country or have graduated and taken up work. During the inspection, we saw a "Children's Palace" with a library, an entertainment room, and a science and technology room. In the science and technology room, there were tools and materials needed for learning to make airplane and ship models and for making simple radio receivers, which were provided for students from various primary schools in the lane to come here in turn to study and work.

　　According to the needs of production and work, various professional training classes such as teachers, cooking, sewing, hygiene, and music have been held successively. Sports activities have also been widely carried out according to the characteristics of women, such as radio exercises, which are regularly attended by 300 people, as well as table tennis, badminton, etc.

　　Regarding the patriotic health campaign to eliminate pests and diseases, this is also an advanced collective unit in the city. Most families have implemented the health care system of "every family has a spittoon, every household uses serving chopsticks (or separate meals), everyone has a towel, and everyone brushes their teeth." The entire lane is always kept clean.

　　The women participating in the production and processing group are the main force in the patriotic health movement. Each production group is organized into a team, and each team contracts a block. They assist residents in carrying out regular patriotic health movements with two and a half days of spare time every Thursday and Sunday. The person in charge of the lane organization told us that such an organized team plays three roles: publicity and education, helping families with less labor force to carry out intensive cleaning, and in-depth inspections. Therefore, they are not only production teams, but also learning teams and lane work teams.

　　New-Type Women

　　What impressed me most during the inspection was seeing the lane women who went out of their homes to participate in labor. Their high political awareness, great enthusiasm for technical innovation, and rich cultural life are all worthy of our learning.

　　1. High political awareness. Due to the development of collective welfare and social service undertakings, housewives are well arranged in housework, trivial matters are greatly reduced, and they can be organized to wholeheartedly serve production and socialist construction directly or indirectly. They broke the idea that "women are inferior to men," established collectivist thinking, and improved socialist consciousness. Family relations have changed, neighbor relations have changed, and the relations between people have all changed. Their status in the family and in society has undergone tremendous changes. In labor production, they loudly put forward the slogan "In order to build socialism, we will do whatever you ask us to do," and also said, "The task of the factory is our task, and we must guarantee its completion." These slogans and guarantees have all been specifically implemented. The person in charge of the lane committee said that these women take political lessons every week and are full of patriotic enthusiasm. When American imperialism colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek gang to create a tense situation in the Taiwan Strait in August 1958, many women requested to join the stretcher team, and the elderly rushed to make military shoes to actively support the front line with concrete actions. During the inspection, a female cadre said sincerely and seriously: "Women have already understood that they must put politics in command, and they must only think about collective interests ideologically, put collective interests first, and forget about themselves." These ideological understandings have been fully reflected in some vivid examples seen and heard.

　　2. Great enthusiasm for technical innovation. Lane women have received multi-faceted education and training in collective production and life, and innovating technology and improving work to improve efficiency and better production have become conscious requirements. Under the bold slogan of "What others can do, we must do, and what others cannot do, we must also do," they launched a vigorous mass technical innovation movement, proposing more than 160 items last year, and a total of 1,117 items by March 8 this year. Not only are they innovating in production and life services, but they are also innovating in eliminating pests and diseases and paying attention to hygiene. During the inspection, we saw an electric washing machine, which was inspired by a female worker from Shanghai Merlin Company who invented a green soybean picking machine. With the strong support of the Party committee and the help of the masses, it was first trial-produced, and then continuously researched and improved by itself. It can wash 200 pieces of clothing every day. In the capacitor processing group, we saw a copper wire coil for manufacturing capacitors using a small motor of an electric fan connected to a rotating shaft, which can reduce the workload of the past day to 75 minutes. Its ingenuity and simplicity aroused our great interest and surprise. The women working in the public canteen showed us vegetable and radish cutting machines, rice washing machines, and new tools for making steamed buns. These kinds of innovative tools increased efficiency by one, several, or even dozens of times.

　　3. Rich cultural life. The women of Zhangjiazhai Lane, due to their enthusiastic labor, serious study, and comfortable life, are filled with joy and happiness, and are full of vigor. They recite poetry, paint, and write, and create and perform dramas on their own, and engage in large-scale literary and artistic creation activities. In the past year or so, they have written more than 12,000 poems praising the three red flags, published six series of "Zhangjiazhai Residents' Poetry Selections," and more than 80 kinds of plays and songs. A woman in the laundry group wrote 100 poems in one night, including a laundry song:

　　"Washing clothes, washing clothes, I am for others,
　　Production, production, is for me,
　　I wash the clothes well,
　　Everyone's production is improved."

　　In extremely simple four sentences, the spirit of closely combining production, social labor, and political and ideological education is well expressed.

　　A woman from a production and processing group sang: "The Communist Party is the great savior, and women have turned themselves over since then. We will do our best to engage in production to repay the great kindness of Chairman Mao." A production team sang praises of collectivization and the people's commune:

　　"The people's commune is really good, women are completely liberated,
　　Children enter the nursery, and collective life is well educated,
　　There is a large canteen for eating, and family chores are thrown away,
　　From then on, leave the pot and stove, and work together to engage in production,
　　Communism will be built early, and a happy life will be happy,
　　Don't forget the farmers when eating, thank Chairman Mao for his good leadership."

　　They are all singing praises of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune with such enthusiasm, thanking the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. They sing out their deep love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and sing out their heroic spirit of loving labor.

　　Masses' Consciousness

　　The fundamental guarantee for the great achievements of Zhangjiazhai Lane's work is the leadership of the Party; and also because in the work of mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses, the following three key points can be grasped. My personal preliminary experience is that it should be affirmed.

　　1. In the work, adhere to the principle of voluntariness in organizing women to participate in labor production and collective life. Use the education of the situation to enlighten the masses to consciously embark on the road of collectivization, without coercion or accommodation, so that all activities are constantly consolidated and gradually developed. Therefore, the organizational work, ideological work, and specific work in this lane are relatively solid and reliable. A working cadre of the lane committee said that Zhangjiazhai was a dark area where the working people suffered all the persecutions of the reactionary rule, and often suffered poverty and death threats before liberation. The local residents called it the Yama area. After liberation, the sunshine of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao shone all over the earth, and Zhangjiazhai also turned over. Through participating in various political movements over the years, the women of working people's families have gradually improved their awareness, and the team participating in the lane activities has continued to expand. When studying the General Line in 1958, the women of working people's families, as this lane cadre told us: "At that time, they already believed that they could stand up and speak. In the past, they relied on their husbands, but now they are asking to engage in production and live independently." The Party organization of the district attached importance to this request, and the district head personally went down to the lane to participate in the work, lead the study, and hold meetings to propose to the masses that they engage in labor production and embark on the road of collectivization. The masses were greatly encouraged, and at that time, more women were further organized in production, life, and education. During the Great Steel Smelting, the women fully exerted their enthusiasm and were further trained. Therefore, in the past two years, Zhangjiazhai's organization of production labor and organization of collective life have been developed step by step under the education and encouragement of the situation and according to the conscious requirements of the masses.

　　2. In the work, adopt a variety of methods and methods for labor production and collective life, and each gets its own principle. For example, in the lightning arrester processing group and the capacitor processing group, we saw younger women operating very skillfully. In the medicine packaging group, we saw women over the age of 50 working attentively and quietly. As for the workplace, we saw that nurseries, kindergartens, children's palaces, etc., use tall and better buildings. The workshops of the production and processing groups mostly use spacious bungalows, while the service labor sites mostly use poor small houses. As for the types of processed products, it is also determined according to the needs of the factories and enterprises linked up. Because of this arrangement, women participating in production services can work hard and give full play to their wisdom, skills, and strength, and have achieved the effect of adapting to people, places, times, and things.

　　3. In the work, establish the principle of taking working women and family members of working people as the backbone. Because they are happy to accept the Party's policies and decisions, have strong combat effectiveness, and are not afraid of difficulties, they play a leading role in promoting the masses. For example, when the organization started in August 1958, many families let out more than 40 houses at once for various public activities under the lead of a worker's family woman who first expressed her willingness to give up her only room for public use. One night, when a meeting was held to discuss how to raise various utensils for the opening of the first canteen, a family member of a worker said: "Poor people should be generous." So the masses put forward the slogan "Residents run the residents' canteen, and take out what they have." On that night, each family took out a total of 1,031 pieces of cooking utensils such as large pots, large steamers, and tables, chairs, bowls, and chopsticks. For example, the literacy work in the lane has been done a lot in the past. When there were more than 300 illiterates who were reluctant to read when they were taught at home last year, a cultural and educational director who was born as an illiterate personally mobilized the masses by using her own experience and organized them. The masses were moved and inspired, and after 40 days of hard work, they finally eliminated them all on September 29 to welcome the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Working women said: "As long as there is the support of the Party and we have confidence, we can do anything." It is with such an ideological foundation that they play a backbone role, and all the work has been carried out very smoothly in the past two years. This is also an important driving force.

　　Bright Future

　　Today, after inspecting the work of Zhangjiazhai Lane and listening to the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, I have clearly realized the excellent situation in which people's communes are being run on a large scale, public welfare undertakings are being run on a large scale, and street lane industries are being run on a large scale in cities across the country. The work of Zhangjiazhai Lane is only one of the many streets and lanes in cities across the country that are advancing separately in collectivization work. The work of Zhangjiazhai has essentially embodied the role of the people's commune. It is possible to further develop "into a tool for transforming old cities and building socialist new cities, a unified organizer of production, exchange, distribution, and people's livelihood welfare, and a social organization that combines workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and integrates government and commune." Therefore, widely organizing the economic life of residents centered on promoting production and serving production, further organizing the urban people, and liberating thousands of urban housewives from housework and participating in social labor can not only enable women to participate in common production labor, but also enable the urban people to muster greater enthusiasm and wholeheartedly engage in construction undertakings, which is conducive to the rapid development of production and construction; at the same time, because of the transformation of housework to socialization and the transformation of life to collectivization, it is conducive to the thorough transformation of social life; that is to say, the active development of streets and lanes in cities across the country towards people's communization is not only beneficial to women in streets and lanes, but also beneficial to residents of all strata in streets and lanes, and at the same time, it is greatly beneficial to the people of the whole country in building our country into a socialist power and transitioning to communism. The vivid examples of significant achievements in many cities over the past year will inevitably become the common aspiration of the vast masses of residents in cities across the country. The person in charge of the Zhangjiazhai Lane Committee said in the final discussion with us: "The women of Zhangjiazhai are very eager to realize the requirements of the people's commune." I had the same view with him at that time. Now, I have a clearer understanding of the law of this development.

　　The experience of such a development situation has made me further realize the greatness of the appeal and guiding significance of the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in December 1958, and realize the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought. Since Chairman Mao made the great call to the people of the whole country in August 1958, "People's Communes are Good," running people's communes has become an unstoppable wave across the country. By the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the resolution further pointed out the direction for the establishment of people's communes in cities. Over the past year or so, a large number of cities across the country have followed the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and actively and step by step carried out this work, which has been comprehensively developed and improved. The family members who have participated have not only made contributions in production, but their socialist consciousness has also been continuously improved. This is the great victory of the firm implementation of the Party's line, principles, and policies, and it is also the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　Most of us members of democratic parties are bourgeois intellectuals, and our family members are also different from the family members of workers and peasants. Facing the current situation in which socialist construction continues to leap forward and the people's commune is developing rapidly, and reviewing the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, I think we should promptly transform ourselves fundamentally in terms of political attitude, ideological consciousness, and living habits, thoroughly transform our bourgeois stance and world outlook, and gradually establish the proletarian stance and world outlook. During the inspection of Zhangjiazhai, the person in charge of the Lane Committee said that just the night before, the committee held a residents' meeting, and more than 100 family members signed up to join the production service labor, some as old as 55 years old, including family members of industrialists and businessmen and family members of intellectuals, and some even asked to participate in more arduous labor. I was very moved to hear this fact. At this great opportunity, we should recognize that life in a small world is not as good as life in a big world, life that is cold and deserted is not as good as life that is full of enthusiasm, life with a short-sighted vision is not as good as life with a long-term vision, and throw ourselves into the work of urban communes with a positive attitude and a happy mood. We must learn from workers and peasants, learn from the family members of working women and working people in the streets and lanes, and learn from the women who recently signed up to participate in labor in Zhangjiazhai. We should encourage each other and promote each other. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, according to different service positions, we should actively participate in business practice, labor practice, and social practice, actively participate in street lane activities, earnestly study Chairman Mao's works and the Party's line and policies, actively serve, and strengthen transformation; adhere to the General Line, adhere to the Great Leap Forward, and adhere to the People's Commune; in the continuing leap forward of this year—the first year of the great 1960s—hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forge ahead bravely, and contribute all our strength!

    把城市人民进一步组织起来　把家庭妇女进一步解放出来
    赵祖康代表谈上海张家宅里弄的新气象主席、各位代表：
    我听了中央各位首长所作的报告，回顾祖国两年来的辉煌成就，展望光明幸福的社会主义共产主义前途，感到无限的欢欣鼓舞。对这几个报告，我完全拥护。我作为在上海工作的一个民主党派成员，回顾上海两年来，特别是去年一年来的深刻变化，最近，并在上海参加了一些视察活动，看到了市区里弄妇女积极参加共同劳动、集体生活的新生欢乐景象，得到了深刻的教育，尤其感到万分兴奋，体会到总路线、大跃进、人民公社三个法宝的巨大威力和毛泽东思想的高深伟大。在此，我向大会汇报一些视察一个里弄工作的情况和感想，不当之处，请各位代表批评指正。
      深刻的变化
    静安区张家宅里弄组织生产、生活、教育集体化的工作，在上海是出色的一个，是全国的一个红旗单位。现有居民三千余户，一万二千八百余人口，其中94.5％是劳动人民。除在职在业的工人和干部以及十六岁以下的少年儿童外，尚余约二千余人，大多数是家庭妇女。1958年9月，在全国工农业生产大跃进和农村人民公社涌跃出现的形势推动下，这个地区的妇女群众，由于党的领导，迅速地进一步组织起来，起了深刻的变化，做出了成绩。
    首先，在劳动生产方面，现在，已有四百多个妇女参加，有避雷器、电容器、缝纫、刺绣、包药等七个加工生产组，都为生产为社会主义建设服务，为国家创造了物质财富。据几个生产组的统计，一年多来，为工厂加工避雷器二十七万五千只，电容器一千二百余只，电磁石听筒柄二万三千只，其他电器零件八万余只，缝纫衣服一万一千二百五十九件，包装药片八百余箱。这些加工生产，仅加工费就达十四万元。同时，先后组织了参加修建铁路、公路，和到工厂、商店、农村参加临时劳动。此外，这个里弄的六百四十四户，在不到一年的时间里，对农村，就提供了四万七千斤米浆和十万余斤“泔脚”，有力的支援了农业生产。
    其次，在办理集体福利和提高生活方面，举办了不少事业，其中有公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、哺乳室以及医疗保健站。参加劳动的妇女除得到工资外，享受到福利方面各种优厚的待遇。在视察时，我们看了一个公共食堂，供给七百人伙食，有的是附近的工厂、机关“搭伙”的，每天早上供给馒头、菜包、糕饼和大饼、油条等，每餐的菜有五分、一角、二角的，群众很为满意。据了解，类似的食堂共有六个，有七十多个工作人员，供给三千六百人的伙食。还看到一处托儿所、幼儿园、哺乳室，共有二十多班级，劳动人民的七岁以下的儿童几乎全部入班，收费很少。
    里弄妇女在参加劳动之后，组织上决定第一次分发工资时，她们都表示不需要，经过开会讨论，决定“自报互评”的方法，才说服了。而当领到工资时，她们兴高采烈，很多人买了毛主席的像，买了国旗，挂在家中客间里，像办喜事一样。
    第三，在社会服务方面，两年来，张家宅是在开始举办生活服务站的基础上，逐渐向着全面组织人民经济生活发展的。这是由于生产劳动日益展开，群众生活不断提高，仅仅办好以公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园为中心的集体福利事业，已不能满足职工及劳动妇女多方面的需要。现在，综合服务站的人数已发展到六十一人，服务范围很广泛，给我们以极为深刻的印象。这个站分各个部门，我们看到了理发室、洗衣房、修理组、废品回收站和一个代办服务处。在修理组看到修理、修补各种日用品和衣着，如修面盆、修胶鞋、钉钮扣、补衣裤、翻新衣服等，在代办服务站看到代办银行储蓄，邮电，代付水电费，代购船票等。服务站还办理出售旺煤球、代烧泡饭、倒便桶、编结绒线衣、收拾房舍、接送儿童、服侍产妇、老人、病人以至于代管全部家务等，做到了“要啥做啥，随叫随到，机动灵活，群众方便”。因此，服务的面也很广，仅为职工和老弱残废居民上门服务的就有四百八十五户，占总户数15％以上。在视察时，里弄负责同志说，现在还举办一个妇女浴室，下一天就要开放，里弄自办菜场也正筹备中。
    第四，在文教卫生方面，家庭妇女走上了集体化道路之后，不仅物质生活得到提高，在普及文化教育方面，也有显著表现，体育卫生也办得很好。家庭妇女现已全部摘去文盲帽子。里弄内先后开办了民办小学有四百余学生，和一所市民业余中学，有六百多人参加学习，其中年龄最大的有五十多岁。解放前，张家宅的劳动人民子弟从没有一人上过大学，解放后，完全不同了，现在已有五百多人在全国各高等学校学习或者毕业了走上工作岗位。在视察时，我们看到了一个“少年宫”，有图书室，有文娱室，有科技室，在科技室里，陈列着为学习制造飞机轮船模型和制造简单的无线电收音机所需的工具和材料，是供给里弄内各个小学学生，轮流来此学习和工作的。
    根据生产、工作的需要还先后举办了师资、烹饪、缝纫、卫生、音乐等各种专业训练班；也根据妇女特点广泛展开了体育活动，如广播操，经常参加的有三百人，以及乒乓球、羽毛球等。
    关于除害灭病爱国卫生，这里也是全市的一个先进集体单位。大部分人家实行了“家家有痰盂，户户用公筷（或分食），个个有毛巾，人人刷牙齿”的保健制度。整个里弄经常保持清洁。
    参加生产加工组的妇女是爱国卫生运动的主力军，每一个生产组组织成一个队，每队包一块，每星期四、星期日以两个半天的业余时间，协助居民开展经常性爱国卫生运动。里弄组织的负责同志向我们说，这样一支组织起来的队伍，起了三个作用：宣传教育，帮助劳动力少的人家搞突击清洁和深入检查。因此她们既是生产队，又是学习队，也是里弄工作队。
      新型的妇女
    在视察中使我感受最深的，是看到了走出家门参加劳动的里弄妇女，她们政治觉悟之高，技术革新干劲之大，和文艺生活之丰富，都是值得我们学习的。
    一、政治觉悟之高。由于集体福利与社会服务事业的发达，家庭妇女在家务上得到很好安排，琐碎事务大大减少，得以组织起来，专心一意直接或间接地为生产为社会主义建设服务。她们破除了“女不如男”的思想，树立了集体主义思想，提高了社会主义觉悟，家庭关系变了，邻居关系变了，人与人的关系都变了。她们在家庭中在社会上的地位起了极大的变化。她们在劳动生产中响亮地提出了“为了社会主义建设，要我们干啥，我们就干啥”的口号，还说，“工厂的任务就是我们的任务，一定要保证完成”。这些口号和保证，她们都具体做到了。里弄委员会的负责同志说，这些妇女每星期上政治课，富有爱国热情。当1958年8月美帝国主义勾结蒋匪帮制造台湾海峡紧张局势时，很多妇女要求参加担架队，老年赶做军鞋，以具体行动积极支援前线。在视察时，一个妇女干部真挚而严肃地说：“妇女们已懂得要政治挂帅，要在思想上只想集体利益，把集体利益放在前面，忘掉自己”。这些思想认识，从看到听到的一些生动事例中，已充分反映出来了。
    二、技术革新干劲之大。里弄妇女在集体生产、生活中，受到了多方面的教育和锻炼，对革新技术，改进工作，以提高效率，更好地生产，已成为自觉的要求。她们在“别人能干的事，我们一定要干，别人不能干的事，我们也要干”的豪迈口号下，开展了轰轰烈烈的群众性的大闹技术革新运动，在去年提出了一百六十多项，到今年3月8日止共提出一千一百一十七项，不仅是生产和生活服务闹革新，连同除害灭病讲卫生也闹革新。在视察时，我们看到一架电动洗衣机，这是一个劳动妇女在得到上海梅林公司一个女工发明拣青豆机的启发之后，经党委领导上大力支持，群众帮助，先用试制，再由自己继续不断地苦思钻研，逐步改进而成的。每天能洗衣二百件。在容电器加工组，看到一架利用电风扇小马达接上一根转轴来制造电容器的铜丝圈的，能把过去一天的工作量减少到七十五分钟完成，灵巧简便引起我们极大的兴趣和惊奇。在公共食堂中工作的妇女们，把切菜切萝卜机，淘米机和做馒头的新工具等拿给我们看。这种种革新工具提高效率达到一倍、几倍以至几十倍。
    三、文艺生活之丰富。张家宅里弄妇女，由于热情地劳动、认真地学习、舒畅地生活，她们的内心充满着喜悦和欢乐，洋溢着蓬勃的生气。她们吟诗作画，自编自演戏剧，大搞文艺创作活动。一年多来，已编写出歌颂三面红旗的诗一万二千余首，刊出了“张家宅居民诗选”六辑，剧目和歌曲八十余种。洗衣组一个妇女，一夜写诗一百篇，其中有洗衣歌一首：
    “洗衣洗衣，是我为人，
    生产生产，是人为我，
    我把衣服洗得好，
    大家生产提得高。”
    以极其通俗的四句，很好地把生产、社会劳动和政治思想教育密切结合起来的精神表达出来了。
    有一个生产加工组的妇女、歌唱道：“共产党是大救星，妇女从此翻了身，挖尽潜力生产搞，报答毛主席的大恩情。”有一个生产小组歌颂集体化，歌颂人民公社道：
    “人民公社真正好，妇女彻底解放了，
    孩子进了托儿所，集体生活教育好，
    吃饭有了大食堂，家庭琐事一齐抛，
    从此离开锅和灶，齐心共把生产搞，
    共产主义早建成，幸福生活乐陶陶，
    吃饭不忘种田人，感谢毛主席好领导。”
    她们都是这样热情沸腾地歌颂总路线，歌颂大跃进，歌颂人民公社，感谢共产党，感谢毛主席。唱出她们对党和毛主席深切爱戴的心情，唱出她们热爱劳动英勇豪迈的气概。
        群众的自觉
    张家宅里弄工作之所以取得很大成就，党的领导是其根本保证；而也由于在发动群众依靠群众的工作中，能掌握以下三个关键，我个人初步体会是应该肯定的。
    一、在工作中对组织妇女群众参加劳动生产、集体生活坚持自愿原则。运用形势教育，启发群众自觉地走上集体化的道路，不勉强，不迁就，使一切活动不断巩固逐步发展。因而这里弄的组织工作、思想工作和具体工作都做得比较踏实牢靠。里弄委员会的一个工作干部说，张家宅在解放前是劳动人民受尽一切反动统治的迫害，经常遭受贫困和死亡威胁的黑暗地带，当地居民称它是阎王地区。解放后，共产党和毛主席的阳光普照大地，张家宅也得到了翻身，家庭妇女历年来通过投入各种政治运动，觉悟逐渐提高，参加里弄活动的队伍不断扩大。到1958年学习总路线时，劳动人民家庭的妇女，正如这个里弄干部向我们说：“那时是已经相信自己能够站起来讲话了，过去靠丈夫，现是要求搞生产，自己独立生活了。”区的党组织重视这个要求，区长亲自下里弄，参加工作，领导学习，召开会议，向群众提出要劳动生产，要走集体化道路。群众得到很大鼓舞，就在那时把更多的妇女在生产、生活、教育方面进一步组织起来了。在大炼钢铁时，妇女群众充分发挥了积极性，进一步得到了锻炼。因此，两年来张家宅的组织生产劳动、组织集体生活，都是在形势的教育鼓舞下，根据群众自觉的要求，有步骤地发展起来的。
    二、在工作中对劳动生产和集体生活的方式方法，采取多种多样、各得其所的原则。例如在避雷器加工组和电容器加工组，看到年龄较轻的妇女很熟练地在操作着。在包药加工组，看到年龄五十岁以上的妇女在专心而安静地工作着。至于工作场所，我们看到托儿所、幼儿园、少年宫等是利用建筑高而较好的楼房。生产加工组的作场，多数是利用较宽敞的平房，而服务性劳动场所，则多数利用较差的小屋。至于加工产品的种类，也是随着挂钩的工厂企业的需要而定。由于这样安排，参加生产服务的妇女都能努力工作，充分发挥了智慧、技能和力量，收到了因人因地因时因事制宜的效果。
    三、在工作中确立以劳动妇女和劳动人民家属做骨干的原则。由于她们乐于接受党的政策和决定，战斗性强，不怕困难，在群众中起着带头推动作用。例如，当1958年8月开始组织时，由于一个工人家庭妇女首先表示自愿腾出她家仅有的一间房屋作为公用的带头下，许多人家一下子就让出房屋四十余间，供各种公共活动之用。在一个夜晚，开会讨论开办第一个食堂如何筹措各种用具时，一个工人家属说：“穷人要穷大方”，于是群众提出“居民食堂居民办，自己有的就自己拿出来”的口号，就在当晚，各家一共拿出炊事用具如大锅子、大蒸笼和桌椅、碗筷等一千零三十一件之多。又如里弄扫盲工作过去做得不少，到去年尚余下三百多文盲上门教，不肯读的情况时，一个文盲出身的文教主任亲自现身说法地向群众动员，并把他们组织起来，群众得到感动和启发，苦战四十天，终于在9月29日全部扫除，迎接建国十周年大庆。劳动妇女说：“只要有党的支持，自己有信心，搞什么都行”，她们就是以这样的思想基础来起骨干作用，两年来各项工作得以很顺利地展开，这也是一个重要动力。
      远大的前程
    在视察张家宅里弄工作之后的今天，听了李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告，使我明确认识了目前全国各城市正在大办人民公社，大办公共福利事业，大办街道里弄工业的大好形势。张家宅里弄工作只是全国各城市很多街道里弄分头并进集体化工作中的一个。张家宅的工作在实质上已经体现了人民公社的作用，它已有可能进一步发展“成为改造旧城市和建设社会主义新城市的工具，成为生产、交换、分配和人民生活福利的统一组织者，成为工农商学兵相结合的和政社合一的社会组织。”因此，广泛地组织以促进生产服务生产为中心的居民的经济生活，把城市人民进一步组织起来，并且使成千成万的城市家庭妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加社会劳动，就既可以使妇女参加共同的生产劳动，又可以使城市人民都可鼓起更大干劲，专心一意地从事建设事业，有利于生产建设的迅速发展；同时由于把家务劳动向社会化、把生活向集体化转变，有利于社会生活的彻底改造；也就是说，全国各城市的街道里弄积极地向人民公社化发展，既对街道里弄妇女有好处，也对街道里弄的各阶层居民有好处，同时对全国人民把我国建设成为社会主义强国并向共产主义过渡大有好处。一年多来，许多城市显著成就的生动事例，必然会成为全国各城市广大居民群众的共同愿望。张家宅里弄委员会的负责同志在同我们最后座谈时说：“张家宅的妇女对实现人民公社的要求很迫切。”我在那时也和他有相同的看法。现在，更加明确了我对这个发展规律的认识。
    对这样一个发展形势的体会，使我也进一步认识到1958年12月中共中央八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”的号召力与指导意义的伟大，认识到毛泽东思想的伟大。自从毛主席在1958年8月向全国人民作出“人民公社好”的伟大号召之后，举办人民公社在全国成为不可阻挡的浪潮。到八届六中全会，在决议中更指出了关于城市成立人民公社的方向。一年多来，全国大批城市就遵循着党中央和毛主席的指示，积极而有步骤地展开这方面的工作，得到了全面的发展和提高，参加的家庭妇女不仅在生产上作出贡献，她们的社会主义觉悟也不断提高，这是党的方针政策坚决贯彻的伟大胜利，也是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    我们民主党派成员，大多数是资产阶级知识分子，我们的家属也不同于工人农民的家属；面对着当前社会主义建设继续大跃进、人民公社迅速发展的形势，重温一下党和毛主席的教导，我想我们应该及时在政治态度、思想意识和生活习惯各方面，从根本上加以改造，彻底改造我们的资产阶级的立场和世界观，逐步树立无产阶级的立场和世界观。在视察张家宅时，里弄委员会负责同志说，就在前一个晚上，委员会召开了居民大会，又有一百多名家庭妇女报名要求加入生产服务劳动，年龄有高到五十五岁的，其中有工商业者家属和知识分子家属还有要求参加比较艰苦的劳动。这一事实使我听了很受感动。当此大好时机我们应该认识，小天地中的生活不如大天地中的生活、冷冷清清的生活不如热气腾腾的生活，鼠目寸光的生活不如高瞻远瞩的生活、而以积极的态度及舒畅的心情投入城市公社工作。我们要向工人农民学习，向街道里弄中劳动妇女劳动人民的家属学习，向张家宅最近报名参加劳动的妇女学习。我们应该互相鼓励，互相推动，在中国共产党的英明领导下，各按不同的工作服务岗位，积极参加业务实践、劳动实践和社会实践，积极参加街道里弄活动，认真学习毛主席的著作和党的方针政策，积极服务，加强改造；坚持总路线，坚持大跃进，坚持人民公社；在今年——伟大的六十年代第一年的继续跃进中，高举毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜，奋勇前进，贡献出一切力量！
