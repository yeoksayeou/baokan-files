Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, 23rd -- Our correspondent Qian Hang reports: The International Women's Congress, held here to commemorate the 50th anniversary of International Women's Day, earnestly and enthusiastically discussed the tasks of women in easing international tensions and achieving universal disarmament on the 22nd and 23rd.

　　More than 100 representatives from all over the world participated in the discussions over these two days. From different perspectives, they came to the same conclusion: defending world peace and achieving universal disarmament are the common aspirations of all women; women around the world must unite and work to stop war and defend peace.

　　Many representatives pointed out that although the current international situation shows signs of easing tensions to some extent, the threat of war still exists. They pointed out that colonialism is the root cause of war, and in order to effectively defend peace, people must stop colonialist aggression and oppression.

　　The head of the Japanese delegation, in her speech, called on women around the world to support the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." She demanded that women of all countries take immediate urgent action on this matter, because the Kishi Nobusuke government will force the Diet to approve this treaty on April 25th. An Algerian representative said to enthusiastic applause that the Algerian people are waging a war imposed on them by French colonialists. This is a war against war and for peace, because peace under the rule of armed aggressors is not true peace. She emphasized that it is impossible to eliminate war before the root causes of war – imperialism and colonialism – are eliminated. This representative is one of the millions of Algerians who have been deprived of the right to return to their homeland.

　　Guo Jian, a representative of the Chinese delegation, said in her speech that Chinese women cherish peace very much, because the Chinese people and women need a lasting peaceful international environment in order to carry out socialist construction and build a better and happier life.

　　She said, "Since 1951, the Chinese government has taken the initiative to repeatedly reduce its armed forces and reduce military expenditures. At present, the number of our armed forces is less than half of the original number. The proportion of military expenditure in the total national expenditure has decreased year by year. The adopted 1960 national budget allocates the vast majority of expenditure to economic and cultural development, while the proportion of military expenditure has been reduced to only 8.3%."

　　Guo Jian spoke about the recently signed Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression between China and Burma, and the border issue agreement between China and Burma and between China and Nepal. She pointed out that this is an important step in consolidating mutually friendly relations. She said that Chinese women fully support their government's proposal that all countries in Asia and the Pacific region sign a peace treaty and establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.

　　Guo Jian paid tribute to the people of many Asian, African and Latin American countries who are struggling for national independence and for the eradication of poverty and backwardness caused by colonialism.

　　She said, "The Japanese people's movement against the revision of the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' is growing stronger. We firmly support their struggle."

　　Guo Jian drew the representatives' attention to the fact that at a time when the international situation is tending to ease, vigilance must still be maintained, because some imperialist governments are stepping up their arms race and frantically developing nuclear weapons and missile bases, attempting to expand military blocs and obstructing the reaching of disarmament agreements. They are fostering fascist forces and reviving West German and Japanese militarism, once again turning these two countries into hotbeds of war.

　　Guo Jian said, "U.S. imperialism still forcibly occupies our territory of Taiwan and has repeatedly violated our territorial waters and airspace. All of these constitute a serious threat to world peace."

　　She concluded by calling on all peace-loving women around the world to unite and force Western countries to adopt an attitude that meets the demands of the people and women of the world, that is, not only to ease international tensions in words, but also in deeds, to ban nuclear weapons, and to achieve universal disarmament. Guo Jian's speech was warmly welcomed by the representatives.

    国际妇女大会上许多代表发言指出
    要保卫和平就必须制止殖民主义侵略
    中国代表郭建谴责美帝国主义严重威胁世界和平
    新华社哥本哈根23日电　本社记者钱行报道：为纪念国际妇女节五十周年而在这里举行的国际妇女大会，在22日和23日认真热烈地讨论了妇女在缓和国际紧张局势和普遍裁军方面的任务。
    来自世界各地的一百多位代表参加了这两天的讨论。她们从不同的角度出发，得出了同样的结论：保卫世界和平和实现普遍裁军是全体妇女的共同愿望；全世界的妇女必须团结起来努力制止战争和保卫和平。
    许多代表指出，目前的国际形势虽然出现了紧张局势趋向某种和缓的迹象，可是战争的威胁依然存在。她们指出，殖民主义是战争的根源，要有效地保卫和平，人民就必须制止殖民主义侵略和压迫。
    日本代表团团长在发言中呼吁全世界妇女支持日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争。她要求各国妇女立即对此采取紧急行动，因为岸信介政府将在4月25日迫使国会批准这个条约。阿尔及利亚的一位代表在热烈的掌声中说，阿尔及利亚人民正在进行着一场被法国殖民主义者强加于他们的战争。这是一场反对战争和争取和平的战争，因为处于武装侵略者统治下的和平不是真正的和平。她着重指出，在战争的根源——帝国主义和殖民主义——被消灭以前是不可能消灭战争的。这位代表是被剥夺回到祖国去的权利的千千万万阿尔及利亚人中的一个。
    中国代表团代表郭建在发言中说，中国妇女非常珍视和平，因为要进行社会主义建设和建立更加美好和幸福的生活，中国人民和妇女需要有持久和平的国际环境。
    她说，“自从1951年以来，中国政府主动地一再裁减武装部队和削减军事开支。目前，我国武装部队的人数还不到原来人数的一半。军事开支在整个国家的支出中的比例逐年下降。已通过的1960年国家预算把绝大部分开支用于经济和文化发展，而军事开支的比例已经削减到只占8.3％。”
    郭建谈到了中国和缅甸之间最近签订的友好和互不侵犯条约，谈到中缅之间以及中国和尼泊尔之间的边境问题协定。她指出，这是巩固相互友好关系的重要步骤。她说，中国妇女完全支持她们的政府的建议：亚洲和太平洋地区的一切国家签订一项和平条约，并且在这个地区建立无原子区。
    郭建向为争取民族独立、争取铲除殖民主义所造成的贫困和落后而斗争的很多亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的人民致敬。
    她说，“日本人民反对修改日美‘安全条约’的运动日益壮大。我们坚决支持他们的斗争。”
    郭建提起代表们注意：在国际局势趋向缓和的时候，还必须保持警惕，因为某些帝国主义政府正在加紧扩军备战，疯狂地发展核武器和导弹基地，企图扩大军事集团，并阻挠达成裁军协定。他们正在扶植法西斯势力，并且复活西德和日本的军国主义，再一次把这两个国家变成战争的策源地。
    郭建说，“美帝国主义仍然用武力霸占着我国领土台湾，并且一再侵犯我国的领海和领空。所有这些都构成对世界和平的严重威胁。”
    她最后号召全世界一切爱好和平的妇女团结起来，迫使西方国家采取符合于全世界人民和妇女的要求的态度，即不仅仅是在口头上而是用行动来缓和国际紧张局势、禁止核武器、实现普遍裁军。郭建的发言受到代表们的热烈欢迎。
