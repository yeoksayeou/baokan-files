    Determined to Study Theory
    Zhang Lin, Instructor Driver, Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot South

    In the past, I only knew how to work hard and never thought about studying theory. In 1957, I was responsible for six locomotives. Initially, I had a lot of energy, but once I relaxed after achieving some success, I wasted coal and accidents occurred. Although I failed six times in a row, I didn't analyze the reasons myself. It was only after education from the Party branch that I realized this was due to my purely technical viewpoint and low level of ideological theory. At this time, the Party committee also called on us to study, so I joined the study group of the West Line Passenger Team. The first philosophy lesson was about how different class positions lead to different views on the same thing. Comrade Du Tingzhi, a train attendant, lectured and gave an example: We believe that vigorously developing the steel industry is a great thing, but the imperialists slander it greatly. The imperialists have different positions and different viewpoints from us. Then he said that there are philosophical principles everywhere in our daily life and gave many examples. When I heard this, I felt very close. It turned out that theory was not unattainable, and this opened the door for me to study theory. In the past two years, I have studied "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party," "Outline of Lectures on Dialectical Materialism," and "Marx, Engels, Lenin on Communist Society" and other books. As an instructor driver, my work is mobile. In addition to participating in collective study and discussion as much as possible, I always squeezed every minute to study on my own. I always carried books and newspapers with me. When I was on a business trip, I carried books in my backpack and put books on my bedside. In the summer, when it was hot, I studied at night on the platform under the street lights. Because of my low level of education, I read many books over and over again. If I really couldn't understand them, I humbly asked other comrades for advice. I bought more than forty reference books alone.

    In 1958, I became a driver captain, and this locomotive has always maintained the honor of being the best in the team in saving coal. In the past, I would have become complacent because of these achievements. However, after studying the Two Points Theory, I realized that there are also bad factors in good things, and good things can also be transformed into bad things. I seriously analyzed the situation and found that there were still two problems in my work: First, less coal was saved in the first half of the month and more coal was saved in the second half of the month; second, I only paid attention to safety and saving, but not to locomotive maintenance and tool management. If these problems are not solved, I will collapse again. I first talked to the drivers individually, and then held several group meetings in a row, focusing on opposing right-leaning ideas, overcoming arrogance, and establishing a comprehensive viewpoint, and organized everyone to debate. Everyone clarified their strengths and weaknesses and paid attention to improving the quality of the locomotive and comprehensively completing the tasks. From January to October 1958, there were no accidents and 110 tons of coal were saved on the basis of the Great Leap Forward target.

    In the past, I used to worry when there was a lot of work and didn't know what to focus on. After studying Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction," I had more methods. "On Contradiction" tells us that contradictions are universal, but there are major and minor contradictions. Once the major contradictions are resolved, many minor contradictions will be resolved as well. At the end of last year, the Zhengzhou Railway Committee called for a major unloading and ranking safety and punctuality competition. We focused on ideological education, mobilizing every shift and every person, giving speeches at large meetings and holding discussions at small meetings. Everyone expressed that they would fight a beautiful battle in the Spring Festival campaign and would not ask for leave or be absent from work. Because we grasped the key link of ideological leadership, we achieved victory in the Spring Festival campaign, restored train punctuality, eliminated all accidents, and prevented five serious and casualty accidents.

    Through the previous period of study, I realized that the socialist construction of the motherland is advancing rapidly, and the responsibility of our working class is glorious and arduous. Only by constantly improving ourselves can we better shoulder the increasingly growing transportation tasks. When I think of these things, I have a clear purpose in studying, a firm confidence in studying, and a tenacious perseverance in studying. Because I deeply realized the importance of studying theory, I also helped everyone study. Last year, I served as a tutor for workers studying philosophy and studying Chairman Mao's works in the West Line Passenger Team, lecturing twice a week, for a total of 150 lectures. In October last year, I was transferred to the East Line. Under the leadership of the Party branch, I formulated a plan, held a youth symposium, explained the situation clearly, and explained that without studying, we cannot adapt to the development of the continuous leap forward situation. When everyone heard this, they became very energetic. I brought my books to the apartment for everyone to read, and mobilized everyone to buy books. We also made a bookshelf ourselves. In this way, a study craze was quickly set off.

    下决心学理论
    郑州机务南段指导司机　张霖
    从前，我只知道好好干活，对学理论从来也没有想过。1957年我包六台车，一开头劲头都很大，等到有了些成绩，一松劲，煤也费了，事故也发生了。虽然一连垮了六次，自己并没有分析原因。经过党支部的教育，才认识到这是由于我的单纯技术观点和思想理论水平不高而产生的。这时，党委也号召我们学习，我便参加了西线客队的学习组。第一次哲学课讲的是不同阶级立场对同一事物会有不同的看法。讲课的是乘务员杜庭芝同志，他举例说：大办钢铁我们认为是大好事，而帝国主义却大肆诬蔑，帝国主义和我们立场不同，观点看法也不同。接着他又说，在我们日常生活中处处都有哲学的道理，举了很多例子。我一听，感到很亲切，原来理论并不是高不可攀的，这就打开了我学习理论的大门。两年多来，我学习了“实践论”、“矛盾论”、
  “关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“党的八届六中全会文件”、“辩证唯物主义讲课提纲”、“马恩列斯论共产主义社会”等书籍。我担任指导司机，工作流动，除了尽可能参加集体学习和讨论外，总是挤一切时间自学，书报不离身，出差时背包里装着书，床头上放着书，夏天天热，夜里就在月台上路灯下学习。由于我文化水平低，很多书都是读了一遍又一遍，实在钻不通，就虚心向别的同志请教，光参考书就买了四十多本。
    1958年我担任司机长，这台车一直保持全队节煤第一的荣誉。要在以前，我又会因为这些成就而产生自满情绪。可是，学习两点论以后，认识到好事中也有坏事的因素，好事也可以转化为坏事。我就认真的分析了情况，发现工作中还存在两个问题：一是上半月节煤少、下半月节煤多；二是只注意安全、节约，不注意机车保养和工具保管。这些问题不解决，又会垮下去。我先找司机个别交谈，又连续召开了几次小组会，以反右倾、打骄气、树立全面观点为中心，组织大家辩论，大伙都明确了优点和缺点，注意了机车质量的提高和全面完成任务。1958年1—10月没出任何事故，在跃进指标的基础上节约一百一十吨煤。
    从前遇到工作一多我就发愁，不知抓哪样才好，学了毛主席的“矛盾论”后，办法也多了。“矛盾论”告诉我们，矛盾是普遍存在的，但有主要次要之分，主要矛盾一解决，许多次要矛盾也就会随着解决了。去年年底，郑州铁委号召开展大卸大排安全正点竞赛运动。我们着重抓住了思想教育，班班发动，人人发动，大会讲小会谈，大伙都表示要在春节战役中打个漂亮仗，不请假、不缺勤。由于抓住了思想领导这一环节，春节战役中取得了胜利，恢复列车正点，消灭了一切事故，并防止恶性及伤亡事故五件。
    通过前一段的学习，我体会到祖国的社会主义建设一日千里，咱们工人阶级的责任是光荣而艰巨的。只有不断提高自己，才能更好地担负起日益增长的运输任务。一想到这些，我就有了明确的学习目的、坚定的学习信心、顽强的学习毅力。由于我深深体会到学习理论的重要，我还帮助大家学习。去年我就担任了西线客车队工人学哲学、学毛主席著作的辅导员，每星期辅导两课，共讲课一百五十次。去年10月，我调到东线，在党支部领导下，制订了规划，召开了青年座谈会，讲清形势，说明不学习就不能适应持续跃进的形势的发展。大伙一听，劲都来了，我把自己的书拿到公寓来，让大伙读，并发动大伙买书，我们并自己动手做了个书架。这样，很快掀起了学习热潮。
