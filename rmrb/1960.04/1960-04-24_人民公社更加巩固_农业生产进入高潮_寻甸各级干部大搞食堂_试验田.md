    People's Communes Further Consolidated  Agricultural Production Enters Climax
    Xundian Cadres at All Levels Vigorously Develop Canteen "Experimental Plots"
    (Reported by this newspaper) The county, commune, and management district level leading cadres of Xundian Hui Autonomous County, Yunnan Province (hereinafter referred to as Xundian County) are vigorously developing canteen "experimental plots." The county party secretary personally went deep into the Beiguan Management District, Third Production Team canteen of the Rende People's Commune to develop an "experimental plot," transforming this previously poorly run canteen into an advanced one. Under the influence of the county party committee's leading cadres, more than 670 canteen "experimental plots" were established throughout the county. Within a short month, many poorly run canteens quickly changed their appearance. Of the 390 relatively backward canteens in the county, 334 have been completely transformed, and 59 have been basically transformed. Through vigorously developing canteen "experimental plots," cadres at all levels have cultivated an increasingly meticulous work style. As the canteens are run better and better, the collectivist ideology of the commune members is constantly growing, and the enthusiasm for production labor is even higher, further consolidating the people's communes. At the same time, this has also promoted an upsurge in agricultural production centered on drought resistance throughout the county.
    To run public canteens well, it is necessary to overcome generalized leadership methods. This canteen "experimental plot" of the Xundian County Party Committee was successful because the county party committee seriously went deep down, specifically solved problems such as canteen leadership, planned grain use, vegetable cultivation, basic construction, and kitchenware reform, and transformed the canteen within half a month. The four county party secretaries of Xundian County took turns going to the kitchen to work as cooks. During the first meal, they discovered that this canteen only did collective cooking. Many commune members took their food home to eat, and some commune members cooked dishes and boiled water at home, resulting in uneven attendance at work and a waste of four hours per person per day. While grinding flour with the cook, the cook told him that the cadres of the Third Production Team were only busy with production and had relaxed their leadership over the canteen. The commune members had long proposed building a dining hall, but the captain was afraid of affecting spring plowing and dared not build it. The captain knew that the canteen staff was impure, but he thought, "Even shrimp are expensive when there are no fish in the river." The production team had a small workforce, so they had to let these people do it. Therefore, the leadership of the canteen was not firmly in the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The cook also told the county party secretary that there was no kitchenware reform in the canteen. Nine people only cooked for 146 people. Grinding flour alone took four people and a horse. In addition, five people cooked and chopped vegetables. The county party secretary also went to the vegetable field and watered the crops to fight the drought together with the commune members. The commune members of the vegetable specialization team reported to him that the canteen only had six mu of vegetable land, and the variety of vegetables was not properly arranged, and there was still half a month's shortage of vegetables.
    After the responsible person of the Xundian County Party Committee worked as a cook for a few days, they specifically found out the root cause of the canteen's poor operation. Therefore, they first started by changing the thinking of the cadres. The county party secretary conducted class education for the production captain, criticized the idea of "Even shrimp are expensive when there are no fish in the river." And helped the canteen to carry out democratic elections. The commune members elected Communist Party members Quan Ziliang and Yang Ermei as the director and deputy director of the canteen management committee. Four excellent poor peasant commune members and one lower-middle peasant commune member were elected as members. Yang Guizhi, a poor peasant activist, after becoming the administrator, regularly announced the grain and financial expenditure accounts to the commune members, and planned to save grain according to the grain consumption standards. The canteen management committee frequently listened to the opinions of the commune members and improved its work, resulting in a new atmosphere of democratic management. The county party secretary also calculated with the production captain the advantages of eating collectively. After the production captain's thinking was clarified, he actively led the commune members to use their spare time to build a dining hall. The county party secretary also chopped wood and made the foundation with the commune members, and a dining hall was quickly built. The canteen also made plans for planting vegetables and raising pigs. In order to solve the vegetable supply problem, the county party secretary discussed with the commune members in the vegetable garden to rush to plant various fast-growing Chinese cabbages, and intercropped ten mu of Chinese cabbage in the flue-cured tobacco and cabbage fields. The canteen also built a horse-drawn rice mill and a vegetable cutting machine, realizing steamed cooking, mechanized rice milling and flour grinding, self-flowing water diversion, and mechanized vegetable cutting. The number of cooks was reduced from the previous nine to three. The canteen had a dining hall, and the quality of the food was greatly improved compared to the past. Every meal had a soup, a dish, and pickles. In the past, commune members had to eat separately, but now commune members automatically come to the canteen to eat. The commune members said, "This time, even if you chase me away, I don't want to leave the canteen."
    The Xundian County Party Committee promptly exchanged experiences in the process of running the canteen "experimental plots." After the appearance of the county party committee's canteen "experimental plot" was completely changed, the county party committee invited cadres at all levels to eat in this canteen and introduced their experiences. After the party secretaries, branch secretaries, and management district directors of each commune returned, they all selected backward canteens or some representative canteens to develop "experimental plots." At present, the backward canteens in the county have basically changed.
    In the past, cadres at all levels in Xundian County were meticulous in grasping production and also grasped animal husbandry relatively tightly, but they did not go deep enough into the canteen. Over the past month, the Xundian County Party Committee has summarized many experiences of promoting production through good living arrangements. Now, cadres at all levels in the county have realized such a law: Wherever the living arrangements are good, the commune members' production enthusiasm is very high, and production is also done well. However, improving living standards must be based on the foundation of great production development. Understanding the dialectical relationship between the two. Therefore, now cadres go deeper into reality more comprehensively, not only to the fields and livestock sheds, but also to the kitchen, working together with commune members and eating from the same pot.
    The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee believes that the experience of leading cadres at all levels in Xundian County in vigorously developing canteen "experimental plots" is very good, and requires all localities, county party committees, commune party committees, and management district party branches to learn from their experience.

    人民公社更加巩固  农业生产进入高潮
    寻甸各级干部大搞食堂“试验田”
    本报讯　云南省寻甸回族自治县（以下简称寻甸县）的县、公社、管理区的各级领导干部大搞食堂“试验田”。县委书记亲自深入仁德人民公社北观管理区第三生产队食堂搞“试验田”，使这个原来办得不好的食堂一跃而为先进食堂。在县委领导干部的影响下，全县办起了食堂“试验田”六百七十多个，在短短一个月的时间内，许多办得不好的食堂迅速改变了面貌，全县原来比较落后的三百九十个食堂，现在彻底转变的有三百三十四个，基本上转变的有五十九个。通过大搞食堂“试验田”，各级干部都养成了越作越细的工作作风。由于食堂越办越好，社员集体主义思想不断增长，生产劳动热情更加高涨，使人民公社得到了进一步的巩固，同时又促进了全县以抗旱为中心的农业生产热潮。
    要认真办好公共食堂，必须克服一般化的领导方法。中共寻甸县委这个食堂“试验田”就是由于县委认真深入下去，具体解决了食堂的领导问题、计划用粮、种菜、基本建设和炊具改革等问题，半个月内就使食堂变了样。寻甸县的四个县委书记轮流下厨房当炊事员，吃第一顿饭时就发现这个食堂只是集体做饭，许多社员都打饭回家吃，有的社员在家炒菜吃、烧开水喝，出工不整齐，每人每天要耽误四个小时。在县委书记和炊事员一起磨面的时候，炊事员告诉他：第三生产队的干部只忙于生产，放松了对食堂的领导。社员早就提议盖一间饭厅，队长怕影响春耕不敢盖；队长知道食堂的工作人员不纯，但是他认为：“河里无鱼虾也贵”，生产队的人手少，只好让这些人干，所以食堂的领导权没有牢固地掌握在贫农、下中农的手里；炊事员还告诉县委书记说：食堂里没有炊具改革，九个人只煮一百四十六个人的饭，仅磨面就用了四个人和一匹马，另外，有五个人煮饭切菜。县委书记又来到菜地里和社员们一起浇水抗旱，蔬菜专业队的社员向他反映：食堂只有六亩菜地，蔬菜的品种安排不当，还差半个月的菜。
    中共寻甸县委的负责人当了几天炊事员，具体地摸到了食堂办不好的根子，因此首先从转变干部的思想着手，县委书记对生产队长进行了阶级教育，批判了“河里无鱼虾也贵”的思想。并帮助这个食堂进行了民主选举，社员们选出了共产党员全子良、杨二梅为食堂管理委员会的正、副主任；又选举了四个优秀的贫农社员和一个下中农社员为委员。贫农积极分子杨桂芝当了事务长以后，定期向社员公布粮食和财政开支账目，按吃粮标准计划节约用粮；食堂管理委员会经常听取社员意见，改进工作，出现了民主管理的新气象。县委书记又和生产队长算了集体吃饭好处多的账。生产队长的思想打通后，积极领导社员利用空闲时间盖饭厅，县委书记也和社员们一起砍木料、做土基，很快就盖好了一个饭厅。食堂里还作出了种菜、养猪的计划，为解决蔬菜供应问题，县委书记在菜园里和社员商量抢种长得快的各种小白菜，在烤烟和莲花白地里间种了十亩小白菜。食堂里又造了马拉碾米机、切菜机，实现了煮饭蒸汽化、碾米磨面机械化、引水自流化、切菜机械化。炊事人员由过去的九人减少到三人。食堂里有了饭厅，饭菜质量又比过去大有提高，每顿饭都有一汤一菜和咸菜。过去社员要分散吃饭，现在社员自动来食堂吃饭，社员说：“这回就是赶我，我也不愿意出食堂了”。
    寻甸县委在办食堂“试验田”的过程中，及时交流经验。在县委食堂“试验田”完全改变面貌以后，县委请各级干部到这个食堂里吃饭，介绍经验。各公社的党委书记、支部书记和管理区主任回去后都选择落后的食堂或一部分有代表性的食堂搞“试验田”。目前全县的落后食堂基本上有了改变。
    过去，寻甸县的各级干部在生产上抓得细致、畜牧业也抓得比较紧，但深入食堂不够。一个月以来，中共寻甸县委总结了不少由于生活安排得好，促进了生产的经验。现在，全县各级干部都认识到这样一个规律：凡是生活安排得好的单位，社员的生产情绪都很饱满，生产也搞得好，但是改善生活又必须建立在生产大发展的基础之上。懂得了两者之间的辩证关系。因此现在干部深入实际更加全面，不仅到田间、到畜厩，也到厨房，和社员共同劳动、同锅吃饭。
    中共云南省委认为寻甸县各级领导干部大搞食堂“试验田”的经验很好，要求各地、县委、公社党委、管理区党支部都学习他们的经验。　　　　　　　　（叶子健）
