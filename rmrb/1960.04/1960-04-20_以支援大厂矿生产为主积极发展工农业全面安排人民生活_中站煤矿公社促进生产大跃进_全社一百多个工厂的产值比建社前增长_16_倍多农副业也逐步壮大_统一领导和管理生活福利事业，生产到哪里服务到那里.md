Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 19th. Under the guiding ideology of serving the production and construction of large state-owned factories and mines, the Zhongzhan Coal Mine People's Commune in Jiaozuo City, Henan Province, has established a series of auxiliary and processing factories and collective welfare undertakings serving the lives of employees in the past year since its establishment, promoting the great leap forward in local industrial and agricultural production centered on coal. In 1959, the annual coal output in the area increased by 75% compared with 1958. In addition, the other two important products, clay and sulfur, increased by 562.26% and 93.1% respectively compared with 1958.

The Zhongzhan Coal Mine People's Commune administers three larger coal mines and sixteen pairs of mine shafts. The coal produced in the area accounts for two-thirds of Jiaozuo City's coal output. In August 1958, with state-owned large factories and mines as the main body and larger mine shafts as the core, the families of factory and mine workers and street residents were absorbed to form a people's commune. Five management areas were established, namely Wangfeng Mine, Lifeng Mine, Zhucun Mine, Sulfur Mine, and Clay Mine, and fifteen agricultural production brigades. The commune has a total of 12,738 households, with a population of 78,390, of which factory and mine workers account for 34% of the total population, family members of workers account for 31% of the total population, and the rest are staff from the commercial, cultural, educational, and health systems and the agricultural population.

After the establishment of the commune, it clarified the idea of focusing on supporting the production of large factories and mines, ensuring that whatever the large factories and mines needed, the commune would support them, and wherever there were difficulties, the commune would fully assist in solving them. First, based on the production characteristics and different requirements of each large factory and mine, they established auxiliary and processing factories such as slag prop factories, waste rubber factories, brick factories, bamboo mat factories, fertilizer factories, machinery factories, and wood factories, as well as collective welfare services for the lives of factory and mine workers such as sewing factories and laundry bureaus, totaling 112 factories. These factories used 117 kinds of waste materials from large factories and mines, such as waste pit wood, waste steel, waste machines, waste rubber, and sulfur slag, to make 1,216 kinds of products needed for coal mine production, such as high car frames, winch frames, mine cars, rails, rubber tubes, and sleepers, which strongly supported coal mine production. At the beginning of 1959, the various mine shafts here launched a coal-grabbing campaign. At that time, the transportation task of mine cars was very heavy. The commune-run industry used waste steel to make more than 12,800 sets of mine car bearings, which were installed on all 3,200 mine cars of the sixteen pairs of mine shafts, increasing the turnover rate of mine cars by 15% to 20%. Not only were all the original mine cars sufficient, but also more than 480 mine cars were extracted to support six pairs of small mine shafts, which could produce more than 3,000 tons of coal per day. From January to March of this year, the commune-run industry also used slag to make 16,712 slag props, supplying them to the Wangfeng, Lifeng, and Zhucun mines, enabling seven working faces to replace pit wood with slag props, saving a total of 1,114 cubic meters of pit wood and more than 38,900 yuan in funds. A lot of bamboo mats are needed for coal mining. In the past, each mine shaft purchased them from other places, and the supply often could not meet the demand. After the establishment of the commune, a bamboo mat processing factory was established, and the entire process from collecting raw materials to weaving them into mats was the responsibility of this processing factory. Now, the bamboo mats used by a large mine shaft are all supplied by the commune. In 1958, just when steelmaking was being carried out on a large scale and coal mines were vigorously engaging in high-yield and abundant production, steel plants in Jiaonan, Zhongzhan, and Wuzhi, Wenxian, and other places, as well as clay mines and sulfur mines of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, urgently needed to transport more than 2.28 million tons of ore, clay, stone, and sulfur from Mantou Mountain, Xingzi City, and Da Wa. However, that place only had rugged paths and could not be accessible by vehicles. Although more than 20,000 people were organized to carry things up the mountain every day, it still could not meet the needs of production. After studying this situation, the commune immediately organized more than 22,780 laborers and 1,107 cars, horse carts, and ox carts, spending more than 2.16 million workdays in more than three months, completing 4,326,200 cubic meters of earth, stone, and sand, opening mountains and filling ditches, erecting bridges, and building four highways and two earthen railways, ensuring the timely completion of the material transportation task. The commune also organized commercial and service departments to establish 174 service points (stations) from above-ground to below-ground, with more than 30 service items, forming a service network centered on production, ensuring that service was provided wherever production went, and service was provided whenever needed. In 1959, Wangfeng Mine organized high-yield production, and a group of new workers were waiting to go down the mine without rubber shoes. After learning about this, the service station immediately sent people to purchase 1,300 pairs and sent them to Wangfeng Mine overnight, ensuring that the workers went down the mine on time. The workers of Wangfeng Mine sent good news to praise them, saying: "Service station, for our sake, sending umbrellas in the rain, sending charcoal in the snow, rain or shine, supporting production."

Before the establishment of the commune, the agricultural teams around the coal mine could not guarantee the supply of vegetables needed by the workers because they were not accustomed to growing vegetables and the idea of serving the factory and mine was not clear. After the establishment of the commune, each agricultural brigade established the idea of agriculture serving large factories and mines such as coal mines, and in accordance with the principle of taking vegetables and meat as the key, vigorously grasped vegetable production, combined with doing a good job in grain production, making agricultural production achieve unprecedented bumper harvests. The whole commune has established three vegetable teams, and the vegetable planting area has expanded from 1,166 mu in 1957 to 7,954 mu, basically achieving self-sufficiency in vegetable consumption. Pigs have also developed to more than 3,900. Various fruit trees have developed from 50,000 to more than 1.28 million.

The commune also uniformly leads and manages the life and welfare undertakings of large factories and mines, enabling large factories and mines to concentrate their efforts on production. At present, the commune has run a total of 232 public canteens, and 92% of the population eats in the canteens. It has also established collective welfare undertakings such as middle schools, primary schools, kindergartens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, maternity hospitals, hospitals (medical clinics), clubs, libraries, cinemas, cultural centers, and bathhouses. Because the collective welfare undertakings of large factories and mines are uniformly managed by the commune, more than 96% of the factory and mine workers have invested in production, and the attendance rate of workers has also been greatly improved. According to the statistics of the commune's large factories and mines in March of this year, the attendance rate of workers reached 97.77%.

The major factories and mines have also provided great support to the commune-run industry and the commune's agricultural production. The six state-owned large factories and mines have given serious guidance and support to the commune-run industry in terms of equipment, training technical personnel, and design drawings, enabling the commune-run industry to develop and grow rapidly in a short period of time, and production technology has also improved rapidly. Before the establishment of the commune, the commune-run machinery factory had only 75 employees and very few production tools, with a monthly output value of 2,059 yuan, and could only produce some simple products. After the establishment of the commune, due to the support given by large factories and mines such as Wangfeng and Lifeng in terms of equipment and training technical personnel, and due to their own efforts, the factory has now developed into a large factory with more than 350 workers, eight workshops including forging, riveting, smelting, and casting, a monthly output value of more than 660,000 yuan, and more than 650 varieties of products, and can manufacture gas generators, water pumps, and yuan vehicles. The various state-owned large factories and mines also adopted the method of "mine-team linkage, mine-supporting team," and often promptly supported agriculture in terms of manpower, equipment, and technical strength. Eight agricultural brigades have realized mechanized irrigation and drainage, electrified milling, and electrified lighting with the support of large factories and mines.

In the past year or so, thanks to the close cooperation and mutual support between the Zhongzhan Coal Mine People's Commune and the state-owned large factories and mines, all aspects of production in the commune have achieved comprehensive, rapid, and great development. At present, the total output value of the 112 factories in the commune has increased by more than 16 times compared with before the establishment of the commune, and the types of products have also increased from 431 before the establishment of the commune to 2,047. Due to the development of production, the commune now has accumulated more than 765,000 yuan. Agriculture, sideline production, transportation, finance, trade, culture, health, and collective welfare undertakings have also become more developed and strengthened under the unified leadership and management of the commune. The lives of the family members of workers participating in the production of the commune have also been significantly improved in the past year or so. Last year, their monthly income per person reached more than 30 yuan. (Attached picture)

    中站煤矿公社促进生产大跃进
    全社一百多个工厂的产值比建社前增长16倍多农副业也逐步壮大
    统一领导和管理生活福利事业，生产到哪里服务到那里
    新华社郑州19日电　河南省焦作市中站煤矿人民公社在为国营大厂矿生产建设服务的思想指导下，建社一年多来，建立了一系列为当地大厂矿服务的辅助性、加工性工厂和为职工生活服务的集体福利事业，促进了当地以煤炭为中心的工农业生产大跃进。1959年，当地的煤炭年产量比1958年增长了75％。另外两种重要产品粘土和硫磺，也比1958年分别增长了562.26％和93.1％。
    中站煤矿人民公社所辖地区有三个较大的煤矿，十六对矿井，全区生产的煤炭相当于焦作市煤炭产量的三分之二。1958年8月，这里以国营大厂矿为主，以较大的矿井为核心，吸收周围厂矿职工家属、街道居民等建成人民公社，分别成立了王封矿、李封矿、朱村矿、硫磺矿、粘土矿共五个管理区和十五个农业生产大队。全社共有一万二千七百三十八户，七万八千三百九十多人，其中厂矿职工占总人口的34％，职工家属占总人口的31％，其余都是商业、文教、卫生系统的工作人员和农业人口。
    公社建立后，明确了以支援大厂矿生产为主的思想，做到了大厂矿需要什么就支援什么，哪里有困难，公社就全力协助解决。首先，他们根据各个大厂矿的生产特点和不同要求，建立了炉渣支柱厂、废橡胶厂、砖厂，荆片厂、化肥厂、机械厂、木工厂等辅助性、加工性工厂以及为厂矿职工生活服务的缝纫厂、洗衣局等共一百一十二个工厂。这些工厂利用大厂矿的废坑木、废钢铁、废机器、废胶、硫磺渣等一百一十七种废料，制成了煤矿生产上需要的高车架、绞车架、矿车、轨道、胶管、枕木等一千二百一十六种产品，有力地支援了煤矿的生产。1959年初，这里的各个矿井都开展了夺煤大战，当时矿车的运输任务非常繁重，社办工业就用废钢铁制成矿车轴承一万二千八百多套，为十六对矿井的三千二百辆矿车全部装起轴承，使矿车周转率提高了15％——20％，不仅原有的矿车全部够用，而且还抽出四百八十多辆矿车支援了六对小矿井，每天可以多产煤三千多吨。今年1月到3月份社办工业还利用炉渣制成炉渣支柱一万六千七百一十二根，供应王封、李封、朱村三个矿井，使七个工作面全部用炉渣支柱代替坑木，共节约坑木一千一百一十四立方米，资金三万八千九百多元。采煤时需要很多荆片，过去各矿井都从外地采购，常常供不应求。公社成立后，建立了一个荆片加工厂，从采集原料到编制成片，都由这个加工厂负责，现在有一个大矿井用的荆片已经全部由公社供给。1958年，正当大办钢铁和煤矿大搞高额丰产运动的时候，焦南、中站和武陟、温县等钢铁厂以及武汉钢铁公司粘土矿、硫磺矿等单位，急需从馒头山、杏子城、大洼等地把二百二十八万多吨的矿石、粘土、料石、硫磺等运下山来，但是那个地方只有崎岖小道，不能通车，虽然每天都组织二万多人上山背运，也不能满足生产需要。公社研究了这种情况后，立即组织二万二千七百八十多名劳力和一千一百零七辆汽车、马车、牛车，用三个多月的时间，花费二百一十六万多个工，完成土、石、砂四百三十二万六千二百立方米，开山填沟、架设桥梁，修建了四条公路、两条土铁路，及时保证了运料任务的完成。公社还组织商业、服务部门在井上到井下建立了服务点（站）一百七十四个，服务的项目有三十多种，形成了以生产为中心的服务网，做到了生产到哪里，服务到那里，什么时候需要，什么时候服务。1959年王封矿组织高产，一批新工人等着下井没有胶鞋，服务站知道后立即派人购进了一千三百双，连夜送到王封矿，保证了工人按时下井，王封矿的工人送喜报表扬他们说：“服务站，为了咱，雨中送伞，雪中送炭，风雨无阻，支持生产。”
    公社成立前，煤矿周围的农业队由于不习惯种菜和为厂矿服务的思想不明确，因而不能保证供应职工所需的蔬菜。公社成立后，各个农业大队树立了农业为煤矿等大厂矿服务的思想，根据以菜、肉为纲的原则，大抓蔬菜生产，结合搞好粮食等生产，使农业生产获得空前大丰收，全社已成立三个蔬菜队，种菜面积由1957年的一千一百六十六亩扩大到七千九百五十四亩，基本上达到了吃菜自给，猪也发展到三千九百多头。各种果木树由五万株发展到一百二十八万多株。
    公社还统一领导和管理大厂矿的生活福利事业，使大厂矿能集中力量搞好生产。目前全社共办公共食堂二百三十二个，92％的人口都在食堂就餐。还举办了中、小学和幼儿园、托儿所、敬老院、妇产院、医院（医疗所）、俱乐部、图书馆、电影院、文化馆、澡塘等集体福利事业。由于大厂矿的集体福利事业由公社统一管理，厂矿职工劳动力有96％以上都投入了生产，职工出勤率也大大提高，据今年3月份全社大厂矿统计，职工出勤率达到97.77％。
    各大厂矿对社办工业和公社的农业生产也给予了很大支援。六个国营大厂矿对社办工业的设备、培养训练技术人员和设计图纸等方面，都给予了认真的指导和支援，使社办工业在短期间内就迅速地发展和壮大起来，生产技术也有了飞速的提高。社营机械厂在成立公社前只有七十五名职工，生产工具很少，月产值二千零五十九元，只能生产一些简单的产品，公社成立后，由于王封、李封等大厂矿在设备和训练技术人员方面对他们给予了支援，并且由于他们自己的努力，现在这个厂已经发展成为拥有三百五十多名工人，有锻铆、冶炼、铸造等八个车间，月产值六十六万多元，生产品种达到六百五十多种，能够制造煤气机、水泵、元车的大工厂。各个国营大厂矿还采取“矿、队挂钩，以矿包队”的办法，经常从人力、设备、技术力量等方面及时支援农业。有八个农业大队在大厂矿的支援下，实现了排灌机械化、磨面电动化、照明电气化。
    一年多来，由于中站煤矿人民公社和国营大厂矿紧密协作、互相支援，全社各项生产都得到了全面的迅速的大发展。现在，全社一百一十二个工厂的产值比公社成立前增长了十六倍多，产品种类也由成立公社前的四百三十一种增加到二千零四十七种，由于生产的发展，公社现有积累七十六万五千多元。农业、副业、交通运输、财政贸易和文化卫生、集体福利事业，也都在公社的统一领导、管理下，更加发展壮大。参加公社生产的职工家属，一年多来生活也有了显著改善，去年她们每人每月收入的工资达三十多元。（附图片）
