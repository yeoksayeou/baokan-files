Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 17th: Berlin newspapers today published an open letter from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to West German workers, in which the "People's Plan on the German Question" was presented.

    The open letter stated that the purpose of this plan is to unify Germany into a peaceful and democratic country through the path of confederation.

    The open letter stated that an understanding between the workers, working-class parties, and workers' organizations of the two Germanys would open a path towards peace and the elimination of tension.

    The open letter stated that negotiations between the two German governments should aim to reach an understanding on the following issues: both Germanys renounce the use of force, threats, and pressure; establish an all-German committee based on the principle of equality; safeguard peace by both Germanys abandoning nuclear armament and missile base construction; jointly strive for complete and thorough disarmament; propose Germany's suggestions on the issue of concluding a peace treaty; and promote the rapprochement of the two parts of Germany through economic and cultural cooperation.

    The open letter stated that a referendum must be held to allow the entire German people to decide whether they agree or disagree with the proposal that both Germanys abandon nuclear armament and carry out complete disarmament.

    The open letter stated that, for the benefit of all Germans and the people of other countries, the status of West Berlin must be resolved. Until German reunification, the best solution for all parties concerned is to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city. To this end, conditions must be created to prevent West Berlin from being used as a base for espionage, subversion, war provocations, and other forms of opposition to the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries. This temporary solution must also include a phased reduction of armed forces and a gradual cancellation of occupation regulations. The temporary solution should also exclude the possibility of producing or deploying nuclear weapons and rocket weapons in West Berlin, and exclude West Berlin residents from serving in the West German army.

    The open letter stated that if the Western countries and Bonn reject a peace treaty, then the anti-Hitler coalition countries that hope to conclude a peace treaty will conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic.

    The open letter stated that for the German people, the significance of the summit conference lies in: reaching an agreement there in the spirit of peaceful coexistence, and teaching the West German revanchist politicians and militarists a lesson. The remnants of war must be eliminated in Germany, and a peaceful path for Germany must be guaranteed through the preparation of a peace treaty and the peaceful resolution of the West Berlin issue.

    This open letter was announced on April 14 by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, at a meeting of the Central League of Democratic Parties and Mass Organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 21st: Walter Ulbricht, First Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, pointed out in a television forum on the 20th that the "People's Plan on the German Question" is beneficial to every German people except for a small handful of militarists, and it points the direction for the struggle of the working class and peace-loving people of the two Germanys to save the nation and defend peace.

    Ulbricht pointed out that the German people have three paths on the issue of reunification: let the militarists launch a war; deepen the division of Germany; and the two Germanys reach an understanding. He said that under the current circumstances, only the third path, namely promoting an understanding between the two governments through the joint struggle of the working classes of the two Germanys, is the only viable path. He said: Today, no one is afraid of militarism, and no one shows an inch of weakness to militarism.

    Ulbricht emphasized that German workers are brothers and have a common interest in opposing West German militarist nuclear armament and defending peace. The division of Germany should not divide the working class as well. He said that as long as the working classes of the two Germanys are united on the issue of the life and death of the German people, then no force in West Germany will dare to launch another massacre of the people.

    Ulbricht said that for the upcoming summit conference, the German Democratic Republic first expects it to reach an agreement on disarmament, the cessation of nuclear armament, and other steps sufficient to guarantee peace in Germany. He said that if the four major powers suggest that the two Germanys participate in joint discussions on preparing a peace treaty and preparing for future reunification, the German Democratic Republic would certainly agree.

    德统一社会党中央向西德工人提出计划
    通过邦联道路实现德国统一
    乌布利希号召德国工人阶级共同斗争
    据新华社柏林17日电　柏林报纸今天刊载了德国统一社会党中央委员会给西德工人的公开信，在这封公开信中提出了“人民关于德国问题的计划”。
    公开信中说，这个计划的目的是通过邦联的道路把德国统一成为一个和平民主的国家。
    公开信中说，两个德国的工人、工人阶级政党和工人组织达成谅解，会打开一条通向和平和消除紧张局势的道路。
    公开信中说，两个德国政府之间的谈判应该以就下列问题达成谅解为目的：两个德国摒弃使用武力，摒弃威胁和施加压力；建立一个以对等原则为基础的全德委员会；通过两个德国放弃原子武装和放弃设置导弹基地的办法来保障和平；共同争取全面彻底裁军；就缔结对德和约问题提出德国的建议；通过经济和文化合作的道路促进德国两部分的接近。
    公开信中说，必须通过公民投票，让全体德国人民决定他们赞同还是不赞同关于两个德国放弃原子武装和在两个德国进行全面裁军的建议。
    公开信中说，为了全体德国人和其他各国人民的利益，必须解决西柏林地位问题。在德国统一以前，对一切有关方面最好的解决办法就是变西柏林为非军事化自由城市。为此，必须创造一些条件，使西柏林不再被用作进行特务活动、颠复活动、战争挑衅和其他形式的反对德意志民主共和国、苏联和其他社会主义国家的基地。这个临时解决办法还必须包括分阶段地减少武装力量和逐步取消占领法规。临时解决办法还应该排除在西柏林生产或者设置原子武器和火箭武器的可能性，并排除西柏林居民在西德军队中服务。
    公开信中说，如果西方国家和波恩拒绝和约，那么，希望缔结和约的反希特勒同盟国家将会同德意志民主共和国缔结和约。
    公开信中说，对德国人民说来，最高级会议的意义在于：在那里要本着和平共处的精神达成协议，并给西德复仇主义政治家和军国主义分子上一课。战争的残迹必须在德国加以消除，必须通过准备和约和西柏林问题的和平解决，保证德国有一条和平的道路。
    这封公开信是由德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在4月14日举行的民主党派和群众组织中央联盟的会议上宣布的。
    新华社柏林21日电　德意志民主共和国第一副总理、德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希20日在电视座谈会上指出，“人民关于德国问题的计划”有利于除了一小撮军国主义分子以外的每一个德国人民，它给两个德国的工人阶级和爱好和平的人为拯救民族和保卫和平而进行的斗争指出了方向。
    乌布利希指出，德国人民在统一问题上有三条道路：让军国主义发动战争；加深德国的分裂；两个德国达成谅解。他说，在目前情况下，只有第三条道路，即通过两个德国工人阶级的共同斗争来促使两国政府达成谅解，才是唯一行得通的道路。他说：今天没有人害怕军国主义，没有人向军国主义表示一厘米的软弱。
    乌布利希强调指出，德国工人是弟兄，有着反对西德军国主义原子武装和保卫和平的共同的利益。德国的分裂不应该使工人阶级也分裂。他说，只要两个德国工人阶级在德国人民的生死存亡问题上一致，那么在西德就没有势力敢于再发动一次新的对人民的屠杀。
    乌布利希说，对于即将召开的最高级会议，德意志民主共和国首先期待它能就裁军、停止原子武装以及其他足以保障德国和平的步骤达成协议。他说，如果四大国建议两个德国参加关于准备和约和以后准备统一的问题所进行的共同讨论，德意志民主共和国当然是同意的。
