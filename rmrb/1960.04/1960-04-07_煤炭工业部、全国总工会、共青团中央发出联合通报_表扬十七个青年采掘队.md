Xinhua News Agency, April 5th. The Ministry of Coal Industry, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly issued a circular on April 2, commending seventeen youth coal mining and tunneling teams.

    In October of last year, inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, one hundred and eight youth coal mining and tunneling teams from the Hegang, Jixi, and Shuangyashan mining areas in Heilongjiang Province jointly proposed a friendly competition initiative to youth coal mining and tunneling teams across the country, advocating for "More Cycles, More Overproduction, Monthly Leaps Forward, Daily Safety." This initiative received an enthusiastic response, with over a thousand youth collectives participating in the competition. Their production levels all achieved significant improvements. This played a significant role in comprehensively completing the leap forward tasks of 1959. The seventeen youth coal mining and tunneling teams commended this time were advanced collectives that achieved outstanding results in this competition, and they were each awarded a banner.
    The circular stated that 1960 is a year of better and more comprehensive leaps forward for China's national economy. The thriving and excellent situation requires the workers fighting on the coal front to innovate again and again, leap forward again and again, and make more outstanding contributions to produce more and better coal, so as to strongly support the comprehensive and continuous leap forward of the socialist construction cause.
    The circular warmly expects the national youth coal mining and tunneling teams and the vast number of young miners to make persistent efforts and achieve greater and better results in the new year.
