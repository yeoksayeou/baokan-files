Chairman, fellow representatives:

    I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1960, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 state final accounts and the 1960 state budget draft, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

    Now, I would like to report to the assembly on the issue of overseas Chinese and our country's work in receiving and settling returning overseas Chinese.

    There are a large number of overseas Chinese, widely distributed, with the vast majority concentrated in Southeast Asian countries. They have always lived in harmony with the local people, establishing extremely deep friendships and becoming envoys of peace and friendship between our country and their countries of residence. Our government has always encouraged overseas Chinese to respect the laws and customs of their countries of residence, not to participate in local political activities, to strive to help the local people develop their economies and cultures, and to live in harmony with the local people. Regarding the complex issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese historically left over, our country is also willing to seek reasonable solutions through friendly consultation with relevant countries. In 1955, our government signed a treaty with the Indonesian government on the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese. This was a major effort by our government to fundamentally resolve the overseas Chinese issue.

    The vast majority of overseas Chinese are working people. For thousands of years, they have worked hard alongside the people of their countries of residence to develop local resources and develop local economies, making certain contributions. The vast number of overseas Chinese have also consistently supported the anti-colonialist struggles and national independence movements of the people of their countries of residence. Many of them have personally participated in these struggles, as is the case in the Philippines, Malaya, Indonesia, and other places. Taking Indonesia as an example, the vast number of overseas Chinese repeatedly fought alongside the Indonesian people in the struggle against Dutch colonialism and Japanese imperialism, and many overseas Chinese shed blood and sacrificed themselves in the struggle. The "Pictorial Album of the Indonesian People's Revolution" published by the Indonesian Information Department in December 1949 also contained many photos and written descriptions of overseas Chinese actively supporting the Indonesian independence struggle, which is a good historical testimony.

    But regrettably, despite the long-standing friendly relations between overseas Chinese and the people of their countries of residence, the deep friendship they have established, and the beneficial contributions they have made to local economic development and national independence, and despite the consistently positive attitude of our government towards resolving the overseas Chinese issue and the effective steps it has proposed to solve the problem, some countries are using the overseas Chinese issue as an excuse to carry out large-scale and comprehensive anti-Chinese activities. Who is behind these anti-Chinese activities? Not the workers and peasants and working people, not the revolutionary intellectuals, nor the national bourgeoisie who truly love their own countries and hope to maintain friendly relations with China, but only a small handful of bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie and some reactionaries. Their purpose is to use the overseas Chinese issue to stir up anti-China activities, incite reactionary national chauvinist sentiments, and divert the spearhead of the national revolution and democratic struggle of their own people against imperialism and colonialism, in order to attack the patriotic, democratic, and progressive forces in their own countries, weaken socialist influence, and pave the way for further military dictatorship. Anti-China and anti-Chinese activities are also part of the international cold war conspiracy orchestrated by US imperialism. US imperialism and Japanese militarism are using anti-China and anti-Chinese activities to step up their conspiracy of political infiltration and economic expansion, attempting to strangle the local national democratic movement.

    After the emergence of large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese activities in some Southeast Asian countries, our government still prioritized peace and friendship and maintained a calm and restrained attitude, making serious representations to the relevant countries and putting forward positive suggestions. In December last year, Foreign Minister Chen Yi, on behalf of our government, sent a letter to Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio, putting forward three suggestions for a comprehensive solution to the overseas Chinese issue between the two countries: requesting the Indonesian government to exchange instruments of ratification of the treaty on dual nationality as soon as possible so that the treaty could come into effect and be implemented as soon as possible; requesting the Indonesian government to effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of those overseas Chinese who voluntarily retain Chinese nationality or choose Indonesian nationality but have not been approved; and emphasizing that the Chinese government is prepared to arrange for those overseas Chinese who cannot make a living or are unwilling to continue to reside in Indonesia to return to China for production, based on their wishes, and hopes that the Indonesian government can be responsible for sending these overseas Chinese back to China in batches and phases.

    The three suggestions put forward by Foreign Minister Chen Yi on behalf of our government are not only out of concern for overseas Chinese and safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests, but also to break the difficult situation in the overseas Chinese issue between the two countries, in order to maintain and develop friendly relations between the two countries. Our government's attitude towards resolving the overseas Chinese issue has been, is now, and will continue to be, to advocate that through resolving the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese, overseas Chinese can choose Indonesian nationality according to the principle of voluntarism, become non-discriminated citizens of Indonesia, and continue to contribute to Indonesia's construction. If the Indonesian government can now take appropriate measures to make more overseas Chinese willing to choose Indonesian nationality, we will certainly welcome it, and we are willing to cooperate with the Indonesian government to persuade overseas Chinese to make such a choice as much as possible. If overseas Chinese still want to retain our nationality, we hope that their legitimate rights and interests can be respected and protected by the Indonesian government so that they can continue to reside in Indonesia, respect Indonesian laws and customs, live in harmony with the local people, and continue to contribute to Indonesia's development. If overseas Chinese continue to be persecuted, causing them to be displaced and unable to make a living, or if overseas Chinese are unwilling to continue to reside, then the Indonesian government should repatriate them back to China. In the event that the Indonesian government has difficulties in providing ships, our government has taken the initiative to dispatch ships to pick them up and will continue to send ships to pick them up. Of course, this does not alleviate the Indonesian government's responsibility for repatriation in the slightest. In order to ensure that overseas Chinese can return to China to work without hindrance, we hope that the negotiations on the repatriation agreement between the two sides can achieve results as soon as possible so that this work can be carried out smoothly in the context of friendly cooperation between the two sides.

    Recently, the Indonesian government has exchanged instruments of ratification of the treaty on dual nationality with our government and established a joint committee to implement the treaty. Negotiations on the repatriation of overseas Chinese are underway. However, it should be pointed out that the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities launched by powerful groups in Indonesia have not stopped, and various facts hindering the return of overseas Chinese continue to appear. We hope that this situation can be changed. The overseas Chinese issue between the two countries is originally a problem that can be solved. If the Indonesian government can have the same sincere desire for friendship as our government, abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Conference spirit, and conduct serious friendly consultations, the negotiations we are conducting should make smooth progress, and the overseas Chinese issue can be fairly and reasonably resolved.

    The great socialist motherland is infinitely concerned about overseas compatriots. If overseas compatriots are subjected to unwarranted discrimination and persecution and want to return to China, we will certainly welcome them back. At present, our country is carrying out socialist construction on a large scale at a high speed. Although we have 650 million people, we still feel that there is a shortage of labor. We are not afraid of having too many people. For all overseas Chinese living around the world who are in trouble and are willing to return to China, we also welcome them to return to China to participate in the great socialist construction.

    In order to warmly receive and properly settle returning overseas Chinese, the State Council specifically issued an instruction on February 2 this year and established the Reception and Settlement Committee for Returning Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China. In the first quarter of this year, we have already received and properly settled nearly 15,000 returning overseas Chinese from Indonesia. These returned overseas Chinese were severely persecuted in the anti-Chinese tide in Indonesia, displaced and unable to make a living, especially the distressed overseas Chinese who were detained in the so-called "reception centers," whose lives were even more tragic. "Return to the country! Contribute to the socialist motherland!" has become their common wish and determination. Before returning to China, some people actively learned various skills, such as driving cars, repairing machines, and harvesting rubber, so that they could devote themselves to the socialist construction of the great motherland after returning to China.

    During the process of transporting overseas Chinese back to China this time, many overseas Chinese carried forward the fine tradition of patriotism and unity. Regardless of class, regardless of gender, everyone was eager to serve the distressed overseas Chinese, and many people even persisted for several days and nights. They said, "If we don't do our job well, we will be sorry to the motherland and sorry to the distressed overseas Chinese." Many overseas Chinese organizations and schools voluntarily vacated their houses to help the distressed overseas Chinese wash clothes, take care of the elderly and sick, and deliver tea and water with meticulous care, highly promoting the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual aid. The slogan they put forward was: "Receive them well, give them enough to eat, send them to the hospital if they are sick, and don't let them lose their belongings." Many doctors volunteered to provide free and preferential medical treatment for the distressed overseas Chinese. Some doctors often went to reception centers, docks, and ships to provide mobile medical treatment for the distressed overseas Chinese, and did not rest at night. Many overseas Chinese enthusiastically gave things to the distressed overseas Chinese without writing their names. Some overseas Chinese provided free photography services for the distressed overseas Chinese. Some barbers and dentists even moved their chairs and mirrors to the reception center to serve the distressed overseas Chinese day and night. The vast number of overseas Chinese are talking about the motherland sending ships to pick up overseas Chinese, which is inspiring. It has further consolidated and expanded the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese!

    All the cadres of our embassy and consulates in Indonesia, headed by Ambassador Huang Zhen, were extremely concerned about the lives of the distressed overseas Chinese and personally went to various reception centers to express their sympathy. Many responsible cadres worked day and night at the docks. All this made the overseas Chinese deeply feel the warmth of the motherland. They said, "We have not left Indonesia yet, and you have already brought the warmth of the motherland to us." Many people were moved to tears, and they shouted at the dock: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" These facts also moved many Indonesians who participated in the work of repatriating overseas Chinese. Some Indonesian staff members said to our distressed overseas Chinese, "I have never seen any country that truly cares about its own citizens like this. As Chinese people, you are so happy!"

    Fellow representatives! Here, I would like to express my deep gratitude and respect to the broad masses of Indonesian people who sympathize with and support the victimized overseas Chinese. Many Indonesians said, "The Indonesian people and the overseas Chinese are friends. The reactionary groups are anti-Chinese, but the broad masses of Indonesian people are opposed to it." When the overseas Chinese were forced to leave their original residences, many Indonesian people saw them off with tears. People's organizations such as the Indonesia-China Friendship Association also sent delegations to West Java to express their sympathy to the overseas Chinese living in the "reception centers" and donated many items. Many Indonesian dockworkers helped the distressed overseas Chinese carry their luggage day and night, regardless of heavy rain and darkness. Their clothes were soaked, so they simply took off their clothes to work. The overseas Chinese were very moved by this friendly assistance. Li Shuncai, a young returned overseas Chinese, brought back a bamboo flute given to him by an Indonesian friend. He said, "As long as I play this bamboo flute, I will think of the friendship of the Indonesian people." The friendship between the overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people is very deep. There are countless vivid examples of mutual assistance between the overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people.

    Fellow representatives, a large number of facts prove that anti-China activities cannot harm the great People's Republic of China in the slightest. The result of anti-Chinese activities can only be "lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet." The anti-China and anti-Chinese activities launched by powerful groups in some Southeast Asian countries have not achieved their goal of打击打击 their own patriotic and democratic forces and isolating our country. The people of these countries are increasingly seeing clearly that anti-China and anti-Chinese activities have precisely fallen into the trap of US imperialism's trick of sowing discord, and that anti-China and anti-Chinese activities are not conducive to the friendly unity of Asian and African countries, nor are they conducive to their own national democratic cause. Therefore, they oppose anti-China and anti-Chinese activities and sympathize with the plight of overseas Chinese.

    The work of receiving and settling returned overseas Chinese currently underway in China has received strong assistance from relevant departments at the central and local levels. The commercial departments proposed "Wherever the returned overseas Chinese go, the supplies will go there." The health departments selected excellent medical personnel to treat the diseases of the returned overseas Chinese. The transportation departments dispatched trains and sufficient vehicles to pick up and transport the returned overseas Chinese. Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan, Guangxi and other provinces (autonomous regions) are all conscientiously carrying out the work of receiving and settling returned overseas Chinese. Many farms and people's communes are vigorously expanding cultivated land, purchasing more farm tools, and building houses in order to settle a large number of returned overseas Chinese, preparing to provide housing for the newly returned overseas Chinese.

    The newly returned overseas Chinese have been quickly and properly settled according to the needs of the country and their personal wishes. Before returning to China, many people wrote letters of determination, expressing their obedience to the needs of the motherland and their willingness to obey the government's allocation. Many of them were neighbors abroad and companions on the long journey, familiar with each other and with the same language habits. Therefore, when settling them, the emphasis was on centralized settlement, and necessary care was given, necessary clothing, bedding, and other items were issued to them, those who were sick were treated, and the elderly without support entered nursing homes. Now, most of them have been settled in state-owned overseas Chinese farms in southern provinces with mild climates, suitable for overseas Chinese to live and work, and convenient for them to give full play to their technical expertise, such as Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, and southern Yunnan, which are evergreen all year round and suitable for planting tropical and subtropical cash crops. Those with technical expertise are employed according to their conditions. A small number of people who are willing to return to their hometowns and reunite with their relatives have also returned to their hometowns with the help of the government and have been properly settled by the local people's committees and people's communes.

    State-owned overseas Chinese farms are our bases for settling returned overseas Chinese for production. Since 1951, the government has successively established eight state-owned overseas Chinese farms and twenty-six overseas Chinese farms operated with overseas Chinese investment. Over the past few years, these overseas Chinese farms have been getting better and better, planting a large number of tropical and subtropical crops, with good harvests, building small agricultural machinery, power generation, fertilizer, and sugar-making factories, and owning a number of tractors. Among them, farms such as Xinglong, Changshan, and Lufeng have also achieved self-sufficiency or partial self-sufficiency in grain, cooking oil, pork, and fresh fish, and the combination of production and life is very good. Moreover, due to the implementation of diversified operations, the labor of the members is properly arranged, and everyone is in the right place. The farms also run their own middle schools and primary schools, implementing a half-work and half-study system, combining education with productive labor. Therefore, these overseas Chinese farms have become happy homes for returned overseas Chinese to work, live, and study. This year, the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is preparing to expand and build twenty larger state-owned overseas Chinese farms in the main overseas Chinese hometowns in the four southern provinces, mainly engaged in tropical and subtropical crops, so that returned overseas Chinese can give full play to their specialties and build their own hometowns.

    This year, returned overseas Chinese students and vocational youths with learning conditions have quickly entered the four secondary remedial schools for returned overseas Chinese students in Guangzhou, Jimei, Shantou, and Beijing, or other schools, and those with economic difficulties have been given scholarships by the schools to reassure them to study. This year, the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission plans to set up two more secondary remedial schools for returned overseas Chinese students in Nanning and Kunming, establish three agricultural technical schools for returned overseas Chinese in Xinglong and Nada in Hainan, Zhangzhou in Fujian, and establish two industrial schools for returned overseas Chinese in Xiamen and Wuhan, and plans to prepare for the establishment of Huaqiao University, to train returned overseas Chinese students and returned overseas Chinese youth into talents needed for the construction of the motherland.

    Fellow representatives, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese returning to China have added new strength to the construction of the motherland. They have worked hard abroad for many years and made beneficial contributions to local economic development. Now they are returning to build their own motherland and hometown, and they will certainly be able to play a greater role. As a group of returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia who arrived in Hainan Island said: "Our ancestors braved hardships and thorns and developed the resources of Indonesia together with the local people. We must use the same spirit to develop the resources of Hainan Island and build Hainan Island better." The returned overseas Chinese have a common desire, which is to do everything possible to contribute to the motherland and repay the motherland's kindness. In order to enable the returned overseas Chinese to better and faster发挥发挥 their strength in socialist construction, the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the overseas Chinese affairs departments in various places have requested the farms, factories, mines, and people's communes that settle the returned overseas Chinese to achieve "four helps": help them solve difficulties, help them learn production techniques, help them properly arrange their lives, and help them make ideological progress.

    Fellow representatives, we believe that under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the people of the whole country, the newly returned overseas Chinese will certainly continue to carry forward the tradition of patriotism, and in the great socialist construction, together with the people of the whole country, actively work, love the collective, study hard, and constantly improve their ideological level and cultural level, and become experts in national construction.

### 祖国是华侨的靠山  华侨事务委员会副主任方方的发言

    祖国是华侨的靠山
    华侨事务委员会副主任方方的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理所作关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理所作关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告、谭震林副总理为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告。
    现在，我就华侨问题和我国接待安置归国华侨的工作，向大会报告一些情况。
    国外华侨人数众多，分布极广，绝大部分集中在东南亚各国，和当地人民一向和睦相处，建立了极其深厚的情谊，成为我国和侨居国之间的和平友好使者。我国政府一向劝勉华侨尊重侨居国的法令和风俗习惯，不参加当地的政治活动，努力帮助当地人民发展经济和文化事业，同当地人民友好相处。对于历史上遗留下来的复杂的华侨双重国籍问题，我国也愿意同有关国家通过友好协商求得合理解决。1955年我国政府同印度尼西亚政府签订了关于华侨双重国籍问题的条约，这是我国政府为了从根本上解决华侨问题而作的一次重大努力。
    华侨绝大部分是劳动人民，他们千百年来同侨居国人民一起，为开发当地的资源、发展当地的经济付出了艰苦的劳动，作出了一定的贡献。广大华侨还一贯支持侨居国人民的反殖民主义斗争和民族独立运动。他们当中的许多人还亲身参加了这些斗争，在菲律宾、马来亚印度尼西亚等地都是如此。以印度尼西亚为例，广大华侨在反抗荷兰殖民主义和日本帝国主义的斗争中，曾多次同印度尼西亚人民并肩作战，有许多华侨在斗争中流血牺牲。就是印度尼西亚情报部1949年12月出版的“印度尼西亚人民革命画册”中，也刊登了许多有关华侨积极支持印度尼西亚独立斗争的照片和文字说明，就是很好的历史见证之一。
    但是遗憾得很，尽管华侨长期以来与侨居国人民友好相处，建立了深厚的友谊，并对当地的经济发展和民族独立事业作出了有益的贡献；尽管我国政府对解决华侨问题一贯采取了积极态度，并提出了解决问题的有效步骤，但有的国家却以华侨问题为借口进行着大规模的全面的排华。是谁在排华呢？不是工农群众和劳动人民，不是革命的知识分子，也不是真正爱他们自己国家的、希望与中国保持友好的民族资产阶级，而只是一小撮官僚买办资产阶级分子和一些反动派。他们的目的是企图借华侨问题掀起反华活动，煽动反动的民族沙文主义情绪，来转移本国人民的反帝国主义反殖民主义的民族革命斗争和民主斗争的锋芒，以便打击他们国内的爱国民主进步力量，削弱社会主义影响，为进一步走向军事独裁铺平道路。反华排华活动又是美帝国主义所策动的国际冷战阴谋的一部分。美帝国主义和日本军国主义正利用反华排华活动，加紧其政治渗透和经济扩张的阴谋，企图扼杀当地的民族民主运动。
    在东南亚有的国家出现大规模的反华排华活动之后，我国政府仍然以和平友好为重，仍然采取了冷静和克制的态度，向有关国家进行了严正的交涉，同时提出了积极的建议。去年12月陈毅外交部长代表我国政府给印度尼西亚苏班德里约外交部长的信中，就全面解决两国间存在的华侨问题提出的三项建议：要求印度尼西亚政府尽快地同我国政府互换关于双重国籍问题的条约的批准书，使这一条约早日生效和付诸实施；要求印度尼西亚政府切实保护那些自愿保留中国国籍或者选择印度尼西亚国籍而未获批准的华侨的正当权利和利益；并且着重提出中国政府准备根据那些无法谋生或者不愿意继续居留在印度尼西亚的华侨的志愿，安排他们回国生产，希望印度尼西亚政府能够负责分批分期地遣送这些华侨回国。
    陈毅外交部长代表我国政府所提出的这三项建议，决不仅出于对华侨的关怀和维护华侨的正当权利和利益，而且是为了打开存在于两国之间的华侨问题上的困难局面，以维护和发展两国之间的友好关系。我国政府对于解决华侨问题的态度过去是，现在是，今后仍然是，主张通过解决华侨的双重国籍问题，使华侨能够根据自愿原则选择印度尼西亚的国籍，成为印度尼西亚的不受歧视的公民，继续为印度尼西亚的建设事业贡献力量。如果现在印度尼西亚政府能够采取适当措施，使更多的华侨愿意选择印度尼西亚国籍，我们当然欢迎，而且愿意同印度尼西亚政府合作，尽量劝说华侨作这样的抉择。如果华侨依然要保留我国国籍，我们希望他们的正当权利和利益，能够受到印度尼西亚政府的尊重和保护，他们才能继续留居在印度尼西亚，尊重印度尼西亚的法令和风俗习惯，和当地人民友好相处，并为印度尼西亚的发展继续做出贡献。华侨继续遭受迫害，使他们流离失所无法谋生，或者华侨不愿意继续留居下去，那么，印度尼西亚政府应当遣送他们回国。在印度尼西亚政府提供船只尚有困难的情况下，我国政府已经主动派遣船只接运并将继续派船接运他们回国。当然这丝毫也不能减轻印度尼西亚政府应当负责遣送的责任。为了使华侨回国工作不受阻挠，我们希望双方关于遣侨协议的谈判能够早日取得结果，使这一工作能在双方友好合作的情况下顺利进行。
    最近，印度尼西亚政府已经同我国政府互换了关于双重国籍问题的条约的批准书，成立了实施这个条约的联合委员会。有关遣送华侨回国的谈判已在进行。但是，应当指出，印度尼西亚有势力的集团所掀起的反华排华活动并没有停止，阻挠华侨回国的种种事实仍在继续出现，我们希望这种情况能够改变。存在于两国之间的华侨问题本来是可以解决的问题。如果印度尼西亚政府能够和我国政府一样具有真诚的友好愿望，遵守和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神，认真进行友好协商，我们两国正在进行的谈判，就应该得到顺利的进展，华侨问题也就能够得到公平合理的解决的。
    伟大的社会主义祖国，对国外侨胞的关怀是无微不至的。侨胞在国外遭受无端的歧视和迫害，他们要回国，我们当然欢迎他们回来。目前我国正高速度地大规模地进行社会主义建设，我们虽有六亿五千万人口，但仍然感到劳动力不足。我们决不怕人多。对于旅居在世界各地的所有遇到困难愿意回国的华侨，我们也同样欢迎他们回国参加伟大的社会主义建设。
    为了热情接待和妥善安置归国华侨，国务院于今年2月2日专门发布了一项指示，并成立了中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会。今年第一季度，我们已经接待并妥善安置了将近一万五千名印度尼西亚归国华侨。这些归侨，都是在印度尼西亚排华的逆流中，遭受严重迫害，流离失所，无以为生，尤其被关在所谓“收容所”的难侨，生活更为悲惨。“回国去！为社会主义祖国贡献力量！”成为他们共同的愿望和决心。在回国之前，有的人就积极学习各种技术，如驾驶汽车、修理机器、收割橡胶等技术，以便回国以后献身于伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业。
    这次在接运华侨回国的过程中，许多华侨发扬了爱国团结的优良传统。他们不分阶层，不分男女，人人争先，热情地为难侨服务，不少人甚至坚持几昼夜。他们说：“工作做不好，对不起祖国，对不起难侨。”许多华侨社团和学校自动地腾出房子，帮助难侨洗衣服，照顾老弱病号、送茶送水，无微不至，高度地发扬了互助互济的精神。他们提出的口号是：“接待好，吃得饱，有病送医院，东西丢不了”，许多医生自愿免费优先为难侨看病。有的医生经常到接待所、码头和船上为难侨巡回看病，晚上也不休息。许多侨胞热情地赠送东西给难侨，不写上自己的名字。有的华侨免费为难侨照相。有的理发师和镶牙师，连椅子和镜子都搬到接待所，日夜为难侨服务。广大华侨都在纷纷谈论祖国派船接侨，人心振奋。更加巩固和扩大了华侨的爱国大团结！
    以黄镇大使为首的我国驻印度尼西亚的使领馆全体干部，对难侨生活极为关怀，亲身到各接待所慰问。许多负责干部在码头上夜以继日的工作。这一切使华侨深深感到祖国的温暖。他们说：“我们还未离开印度尼西亚，你们已经把祖国的温暖带给我们了。”许多人感动得流了眼泪，他们在码头上高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”这些事实也使许多参与遣送华侨工作的印度尼西亚人受到感动。有的印度尼西亚工作人员对我们的难侨说：“我从未见过那个国家这样真正关怀自己的侨民，作为中国人，你们真是太幸福了！”
    各位代表！在这里，我要向同情和支持受害华侨的印度尼西亚广大人民表示深切的感谢和敬意。许多印度尼西亚人说：“印度尼西亚人民和华侨是朋友。反动集团排华而广大印度尼西亚人民是反对的。”当华侨被迫离开原住地的时候，许多印度尼西亚人民流泪送别。印度尼西亚—中国友好协会等人民团体，还曾派遣代表团到西爪哇慰问住在“收容所”里的华侨，赠送了许多物品。许多印度尼西亚的码头工人不管大雨黑夜，通宵达旦地帮助难侨搬运行李，他们的衣服湿透了，就干脆脱掉衣服工作。华侨对这种友好的帮助，非常感动。青年归侨李顺才带回来一支印度尼西亚朋友送给他的洞箫。他说：“只要一吹起这只洞箫，就会想起印度尼西亚人民的情谊。”华侨和印度尼西亚人民结下的情谊是非常深厚的，华侨和印度尼西亚人民之间的友好相助的生动事例，也是不胜枚举的。
    各位代表，大量事实证明：反华决不能损害伟大的中华人民共和国一根毫毛。排华的结果只能是“搬起石头砸自己的脚”。东南亚有的国家中的有势力集团掀起的反华排华活动，并没有达到打击他们本国爱国民主力量和孤立我国的目的。这些国家的人民越来越看得清楚：反华排华恰恰中了美帝国主义挑拨离间的诡计，反华排华既不利于亚非国家的友好团结，也有害于本国民族民主事业。因此，他们反对反华排华活动，同情华侨的处境。
    国内目前正在进行着的接待和安置归侨的工作，得到了中央和地方各有关部门的大力协助。商业部门提出“归侨到那里，供应到那里”。卫生部门选派优秀的医务人员为归侨医治疾病。交通部门调出了火车和足够的汽车接运归侨。广东、福建、云南、广西等省（自治区）都认真地进行接待和安置归侨的工作。许多农场和人民公社为了大量安置归侨，都在大力扩大耕地面积，增购农具，修建房屋，准备给新归侨居住。
    新归国的华侨，都已经根据国家的需要和个人志愿，迅速地得到了妥善安置。他们在回国之前，许多人就写决心书，表示服从祖国的需要，听从政府的分配。他们许多人在国外是邻居，在漫长的旅途中又是同伴，彼此熟悉，语言习惯相同，因此在安置他们的时候，以集中安置为主，并给了必要的照顾，发给他们必要的衣服、被褥等物品，有病的予以治疗，无依靠的老人进敬老院。现在，他们中的大多数已被安置在气候温和、适合华侨生活、劳动，又便于发挥他们技术特长的南方各省的国营华侨农场。如广东、福建、广西、云南南部，那里都是四季常青，适合种植热带、亚热带经济作物的地区。对有技术专长的，则根据条件，量才录用。有少数愿意回原籍和亲属团聚的，也都在政府的帮助下回到家乡，并由当地人民委员会和人民公社妥善安置。
    国营华侨农场是我们安置归侨生产的基地。从1951年起，政府先后创办了八个国营华侨农场，并有由华侨投资经营的二十六个华侨农场。几年来，这些华侨农场越办越好，种植了大量的热带、亚热带作物，收获都不差，兴建了小型的农械、发电、化肥、制糖等工厂，拥有若干拖拉机。其中如兴隆、常山、陆丰等农场，还做到粮食、食油、猪肉、鲜鱼等自给或部分自给，生产和生活结合得很好。又由于实行多种经营，场员的劳动都得到适当安排，各得其所。农场还自办有中学、小学，实行半工半读，做到教育和生产劳动相结合。所以，这些华侨农场已经成为归侨劳动、生活、学习的幸福家园。今年，中央华侨事务委员会准备在南方四省主要侨乡扩建和新建二十个规模较大的国营华侨农场，主要经营热带和亚热带作物，以便归侨回来能充分发挥他们的特长，建设自己的家乡。
    今年回国的华侨学生和具有学习条件的职业青年，已经迅速地分别进入广州、集美、汕头、北京四所归国华侨学生中等补习学校或其他学校学习，经济有困难的，学校发给助学金，使他们安心学习。中央华侨事务委员会今年计划在南宁、昆明再办两所归国华侨学生中等补习学校，在海南的兴隆、那大，福建的漳州建立三所归国华侨农业技术学校，在厦门、武汉建立两所归国华侨工业学校，并拟筹建华侨大学，将归国华侨学生和归国华侨青年培养成为祖国建设所需要的人材。
    各位代表，成千上万的华侨回国给祖国建设增加了新的力量。他们在国外长年辛勤劳动，为当地经济发展做了有益的贡献，现在他们回来建设自己的祖国和家乡，一定能够更大地发挥他们的作用。正如一批到达海南岛的印度尼西亚归侨们所说的：“我们的先辈披荆斩棘和当地人民一起开发了印度尼西亚的资源，我们一定要用同样的精神开发海南岛的资源，把海南岛建设得更好。”归侨们都有一个共同的愿望，就是尽一切力量为祖国做出贡献，报答祖国的恩情。为了使归侨们更好更快地在社会主义建设中发挥他们的力量，中央华侨事务委员会和各地侨务部门，已经商请安置归侨的农场、厂矿、人民公社，要做到“四帮”：帮助他们解决困难，帮助他们学习生产技术，帮助他们妥善安排生活，帮助他们思想进步。
    各位代表，我们相信，在党的领导下，在全国人民的帮助下，新回国的华侨，一定能够继续发扬爱国主义传统，在伟大的社会主义建设中，和全国人民一道，积极劳动，热爱集体，努力学习，不断提高思想水平和文化水平，成为国家建设的能手。
