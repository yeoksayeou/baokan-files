Li Nongqin: A Skilled and Dedicated Female Worker

By our staff reporter Wang An

Inside the tall factory buildings, rows of spinning machines whirred, with countless spindles flying. Female workers moved back and forth between the machines, as the workshop's technical performance competition was in full swing. The loudspeaker announced: "Wang Fengying tied ten ends in twenty-nine seconds, matching Li Nongqin; Xi Xiuyun changed six roving strands in ninety-five seconds, fifteen seconds slower than Li Nongqin." Li Nongqin, an advanced producer attending the National Conference of Heroes, was covered in sweat as she taught her competitor, Xi Xiuyun, the method of finding broken ends and changing roving strands with both hands. Xi Xiuyun was an experienced spinning frame operator. Before the competition, she had practiced diligently for many days, determined to catch up with Li Nongqin. At the start of the competition, Xi Xiuyun only used one hand to find broken ends when changing roving strands. Several times, her results were far behind Li Nongqin. Li Nongqin noticed Xi Xiuyun's operational shortcomings and immediately demonstrated her own operations to Xi Xiuyun, until Xi Xiuyun fully learned it. After Xi Xiuyun caught up with Li Nongqin with a score of eighty seconds for changing six roving strands, the two competitors congratulated each other happily.

Li Nongqin is a twenty-two-year-old girl from Hunan Province. She is calm and composed when operating the spinning frame, connects ends quickly, has few breaks, and produces little cotton waste. Last year alone, she proposed sixty-four technical innovation suggestions, completed the production plan every month, and is an outstanding "skilled weaver" in the fine spinning workshop. In particular, she enthusiastically helps others, does everything possible to impart her advanced technology and experience to everyone, and works hard without complaint, playing a significant role in improving the production technology level of the entire workshop and factory. She has not only become a model for spinning frame operators, but also winding workers, dyeing workers, and even machinists and fitters sincerely call her "Master Li." The thousands of workers at the Xinjiang July 1st Cotton Textile Factory have progressed from a few workers in the same trades learning Li Nongqin's advanced technology to all factory employees learning from Li Nongqin.

Last spring, a large number of new workers entered the July 1st Cotton Textile Factory. New workers from various ethnic groups such as Han, Uyghur, and Kazakh in the fine spinning workshop exceeded 80% of the total number of people in the workshop. The operational skills of a few older workers reached about ninety-five points in testing, while the average for the entire workshop was only sixty-eight points. Some new workers still produced a lot of cotton waste and little good yarn when watching two hundred spindles, which seriously affected the improvement of the production level of the entire workshop and even the entire factory. Some workers complained that Li Nongqin only cared about completing her own plan well and did not help others, showing some individualism. Li Nongqin couldn't understand it for a while. Several meetings were held in the team and the entire class, and the Party branch secretary also talked to her. Li Nongqin said aggrievedly: "Isn't it good for me to complete the production plan?" The branch secretary said: "Wouldn't it be better if you could help everyone complete it and improve?" Then, the Party branch secretary calculated an account with Li Nongqin. Just by reducing the cotton waste produced by the new workers in the factory to the level of the older workers, more than 200,000 jin of cotton could be saved a year, which could be spun into good yarn. The Party branch secretary said, both comforting and criticizing: "You are a member of the Communist Youth League, an older worker, and a production expert, so you have a great responsibility!" After intense ideological struggle, Li Nongqin slowly felt as if she stood taller and saw further. When she began to deeply realize how small one person seemed compared to the collective, all her grievances disappeared, and she deeply thanked the Party organization and comrades for their help.

From then on, the idea that "it's not good for one person to be good, it's good for everyone to be good" was deeply rooted in Li Nongqin's heart. From then on, she transformed from an expert who only cared about her own good production into a model who cared about the collective and helped others. New worker Wang Xiulan was in the same group as Li Nongqin and often failed to complete the production plan, affecting the completion of the entire work area's production plan. The deputy foreman and some older workers went to help, but the effect was not great. Li Nongqin volunteered to help Wang Xiulan. She helped Wang Xiulan with her spinning frame during work hours, and after work, she helped Wang Xiulan study and practice diligently. They were often seen studying operational techniques together in the dormitory and in the cafeteria. Wang Xiulan was very touched to see Li Nongqin often sacrificing her rest time or putting down her work to help her. She said to Li Nongqin uneasily: "I'm just stupid, delaying your rest and production." Li Nongqin said: "This is not just a matter between you and me, it's a matter for all of us. Maybe I'm not teaching well." Li Nongqin studied with several older workers and improved the teaching method, focusing on Wang Xiulan's main weakness of slow end tying, teaching Wang Xiulan the end tying method step by step. With her constant encouragement and patient help, Wang Xiulan finally broke through the technical barrier in less than two weeks. Her end tying speed was twice as fast as before, the cotton waste was greatly reduced, and she increased from operating four hundred spindles to six hundred spindles, catching up with the advanced level.

After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the production enthusiasm of most new workers was even higher, but they encountered some technical difficulties in learning advanced operation methods. One day, a big-character poster was put up in the workshop. It turned out that Li Nongqin had requested to leave the group that had maintained the advanced collective title for six consecutive years and go to other shifts and groups to perform spinning frame operations and impart technology. After the leadership approved her application, Li Nongqin took turns operating spinning frames in shifts A, B, and C. Wherever there were difficult machines to operate, she went there. Each time, she excellently completed the production plan and unreservedly imparted her technology to others. Uyghur new workers Zuoyim and Amina often failed to complete the production plan and always complained that their machines were difficult to operate. When Li Nongqin was operating the spinning frame in shift A, she often came to work early to guide Amina and other new workers in shift B who were taking over. After work, she stayed in the workshop to help Zuoyim and other shift B workers who were taking over. She busied herself day and night in the workshop, never caring about herself. Sometimes, when she couldn't communicate with the ethnic minority new workers, she used gestures and demonstrations. If they still didn't understand, she would find some Uyghur older workers with more skilled technology to teach them. Through them, she would pass on advanced operating techniques to the ethnic minority new workers. Soon, batches of ethnic minority new workers mastered advanced operating methods. Zuoyim's measured performance reached ninety-nine points during operation, catching up with Li Nongqin. Amina also increased from operating two hundred spindles to six hundred spindles, reaching the advanced level.

When helping others, Li Nongqin has always been enthusiastic and unafraid of difficulties. Even if some people show indifference or unwelcoming attitudes, she doesn't take these personal difficulties to heart when she thinks of it as a collective undertaking. Old worker Wang Fengying's spinning frame technology is also one of the best, but she is not humble. She refused to learn when Li Nongqin's operation method was first promoted. When others said Li Nongqin was good, she angrily shouted: "There's nothing great about it!" On the one hand, Li Nongqin took the initiative to humbly learn from Wang Fengying, absorbing Wang Fengying's advantages of fast roving change and good quality in operation. She also sincerely pointed out Wang Fengying's shortcomings of arrogance, and technically helped Wang Fengying improve the end tying method. With Li Nongqin's help, Wang Fengying had a significant transformation. Not only could she actively help new workers, but she could also humbly learn from others, and her technology was comprehensively improved. In the factory-wide technical performance competition in mid-February, she and Li Nongqin became the "sister champions" of female spinning frame operators with equally excellent results.

From her personal experience, Li Nongqin deeply realized that ideological help is even better than technical help. Therefore, while providing technical assistance to the comrades around her, she paid special attention to political and ideological assistance. New worker Li Peiru was young, did not care about political life, and progressed very slowly. New workers who entered the factory could all operate four hundred spindles, but she could only operate two hundred spindles and was often flustered. While patiently helping Li Peiru improve her technology, Li Nongqin provided more help from an ideological perspective. She found that Li Peiru was fond of reading comic books, so she introduced some revolutionary literary works to Li Peiru, and gradually cultivated Li Peiru's enthusiasm for reading youth self-cultivation and political theory books. Li Peiru missed her home, so Li Nongqin took special care of her in life, asking about her health and well-being. When Li Peiru was sick, Li Nongqin went to take care of her, serving tea and water. Li Peiru lacked confidence in improving her technology, so Li Nongqin encouraged her, comforted her, and signed a master-apprentice contract with her, guaranteeing to teach her. With Li Nongqin's help, Li Peiru not only improved her ideological awareness, but also reached the level of old workers in technology. She also joined the Communist Youth League through Li Nongqin's introduction.

Although Li Nongqin is a factory-wide production model worker and attended the National Conference of Heroes in Beijing last year, she is not proud of it. She has always maintained a humble style and learned from the advanced. She could only tie seventeen or eighteen ends per minute, but after learning from the experience of old workers such as Wang Chuanfen and Lin Qin, and synthesizing their advantages, she increased her end tying to twenty-four ends per minute. New worker Zhao Guilan did not miss any ends during the spinning frame patrol, so Li Nongqin took Zhao Guilan as her teacher. In this way, her spinning frame technology has been comprehensively and continuously improved, maintaining its advanced level. In December last year, Li Nongqin gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. She said: "I will always listen to the Party, maintain the honor of an advanced producer, work harder to play the role of an advanced producer, and be a Communist Party member worthy of the name."

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, Li Nongqin took the initiative to help everyone learn advanced operating methods. Li Nongqin (right) actively imparts experience in the workshop, and often uses her spare time to teach everyone technology in the dormitory. This is her teaching comrades how to connect roving strands in the dormitory.

    心红手巧的女工李弄琴
    本报记者　王安
    高大的厂房里，一排排纺机上，千万个纱锭嗡嗡地飞转。女工们在机器弄挡间穿来穿去，车间技术表演运动会正在进行着激烈的竞赛。广播喇叭喊着：“王凤英二十九秒钟接十个头，赶上李弄琴；郗秀云换六个粗纱九十五秒，比李弄琴慢十五秒”。出席全国群英会的先进生产者李弄琴，正满头大汗地教自己的竞赛对手郗秀云一遍又一遍地学习双手并用找断头的换粗纱方法。郗秀云是一个老挡车工，竞赛以前，勤学苦练了好多天，一心要赶上李弄琴。竞赛一开始，郗秀云换粗纱时只会一只手找断头，接连几次，成绩都大大落后于李弄琴。李弄琴看出了郗秀云操作上的缺点，并且当场就把自己的操作表演给郗秀云看，直到郗秀云完全学会，以八十秒钟换六个粗纱的成绩赶上李弄琴以后，两个竞赛对手才欢欢喜喜地互相祝贺。
    李弄琴是一个二十二岁的湖南姑娘，挡车时不慌不忙，接头快、断头少，出的白花少。去年一年，她一个人就提出六十四件技术革新建议，月月完成生产计划，是精纺车间出色的“巧织女”。特别是她满腔热情地帮助别人，千方百计地把自己的先进技术和经验传授给大家，任劳任怨，在提高全车间、全厂的生产技术水平方面起了很大的作用。不但成为纺纱挡车工人的标兵，落纱工、印染工甚至机工、钳工都心悦诚服地喊她“李师傅”。新疆七一棉纺织厂的几千名工人，从少数同工种工人学习李弄琴的先进技术，发展到全厂职工向李弄琴学习。
    去年春天，大批新工人走进了七一棉纺织厂，精纺车间的汉、维吾尔、哈萨克等各族新工人，超过了全车间人数的80％以上。少数老工人的操作技术水平，在测定时都达到九十五分左右，而全车间平均下来才只有六十八分；有些新工人看二百纱锭，还是白花多，好纱少，严重地影响了全车间甚至全厂生产水平的提高。有的工人提意见，说李弄琴只顾自己完成计划好，不帮助别人，有点个人主义。李弄琴一时想不通，小组、全班开了好几次会，党支部书记也找她谈话，李弄琴委屈地说：“我完成生产计划难道不好吗？”支部书记说：“你能帮助大家都完成，都提高不是更好吗？”接着，党支部书记就和李弄琴算了一笔账，单是把全厂新工人挡车出的白花降低到老工人的水平，一年就能节约二十多万斤棉花，可以纺成好纱。党支部书记又像安慰又像批评地说：“你是共青团员，老工人，又是生产能手，责任可大着哪！”经过激烈的思想斗争，李弄琴慢慢的觉得仿佛站得高了一些，也看得远了一些。当她开始深切地认识到一个人再好，但和集体比较又显得多么渺小，她一肚子的委屈都烟消云散了，内心里深深感激党组织和同志们的帮助。
    从这以后，“一个人好不算好，大家好才是好”的思想，就深深地在李弄琴心中扎了根。从此，她从一个只顾自己生产好的能手，转变成为关心集体、帮助别人的标兵。新工人王秀兰和李弄琴在一个小组，经常完不成生产计划，影响全工区生产计划的完成。副工长和一些老工人去帮助，效果也不大。李弄琴就自告奋勇帮助王秀兰，上班时她帮助王秀兰挡车，下班后又帮助王秀兰勤学苦练，在宿舍里、食堂里都经常看见她们两个人在一起研究操作技术。王秀兰见李弄琴经常牺牲了休息时间或是搁下手里的活来帮助自己，非常感动，不安地向李弄琴说：“我这人就是笨，耽误了你休息和生产。”李弄琴说：“这不是你和我个人的事，是咱们大伙的事，大概是我教的不得法。”李弄琴就和几个老工人研究，改进了教学方法，针对着王秀兰接头慢的主要缺点，一个动作一个动作手把着手教王秀兰接头方法。在她不断的鼓励与耐心的帮助下，不到两个星期，王秀兰终于突破了技术关，接头速度比过去快了一倍，白花大大减少，并且从挡四百锭提高到六百锭，赶上了先进水平。
    党的八届八中全会的公报和决议公布以后，当时大部分新工人的生产热情更加高涨，但是在学习先进操作法时，碰到一些技术上的困难。有一天，车间里贴出一张大字报，原来是李弄琴提出要求离开连续六年保持先进集体的小组，到别的班、组去挡车表演，传授技术。领导上批准了她的申请以后，李弄琴就挨次在甲、乙、丙三个班轮流挡车，哪里有难挡的车，她就到那里去，每次都出色地完成生产计划，并且把技术毫无保留地传授给别人。维吾尔族新工人佐伊姆、阿米娜经常完不成生产计划，老是抱怨自己的车难挡。李弄琴在甲班挡车时，往往提前上班，指导交班的乙班阿米娜等新工人操作。下班以后还留在车间，帮助来接班的乙班工人佐伊姆等挡车。日夜奔忙在车间里，从来不顾自己的一切。有时和少数民族新工人说不通话，就打手势、表演，再不懂，就去找一些技术比较熟练的维吾尔族老工人传授，通过她们，再把先进的操作技术传授给少数民族的新工人。很快，成批的少数民族新工人就掌握了先进操作法，佐伊姆操作时测定成绩达到九十九分，赶上了李弄琴；阿米娜也从挡二百纱锭提高到六百纱锭，达到了先进水平。
    李弄琴在帮助别人时，一贯热情，不怕困难。即使遇到有的人表示冷淡或者不欢迎的态度，她一想到这是集体的事业，就把个人碰到的这些困难不放在心上。老工人王凤英挡车技术也是数一数二的，但是不虚心。开始推广李弄琴操作法时，她就是不学。别人说李弄琴好，她就气呼呼地嚷：“没啥了不起！”李弄琴一方面主动地虚心向王凤英学习，吸收王凤英操作中换粗纱快、质量好的优点，又诚恳地指出王凤英骄傲的缺点，并且从技术上帮助王凤英改进了接头方法。在李弄琴的帮助下，王凤英有了显著的转变，不但能主动地帮助新工人，同时也能虚心向别人学习，技术得到了全面提高。在2月中旬全厂技术表演竞赛运动会上，和李弄琴以同样优秀的成绩成为挡车女工的“姊妹冠军”。
    李弄琴从切身体会中，深深地认识到思想上的帮助，更胜于技术上的帮助。于是她在对周围同志进行技术帮助的同时，特别注意政治思想上的帮助。新工人黎佩茹年纪小，不关心政治生活，进步很慢。进厂的新工人都能挡四百锭了，而她只能挡二百锭，还经常手忙脚乱。李弄琴在耐心帮助黎佩茹提高技术的同时，更多地从思想方面进行帮助。她发现黎佩茹贪看小人书，就介绍一些革命文学作品给黎佩茹看，并且逐步培养黎佩茹对阅读青年修养和政治理论书籍的热情。黎佩茹想家，李弄琴就特别在生活上照顾她，问寒问暖。黎佩茹病了，李弄琴就去看护，端茶倒水。黎佩茹对提高技术的信心不足，李弄琴就鼓励她、安慰她，并且和她订师徒合同，保证教会。黎佩茹在李弄琴帮助下，不仅思想觉悟有了提高，在技术上已经达到老工人的水平。并且经过李弄琴介绍，参加了共青团。
    李弄琴虽然是全厂生产标兵，去年还到北京出席了全国群英会，但她并不因此而骄傲，一贯保持谦逊的作风，向先进学习。她原来每分钟只能接十七、八根头，学习了王传芬、林琴等老工人的经验，并综合她们的优点，使接头提高到每分钟二十四根；新工人赵桂兰挡车巡回中不漏头，李弄琴就拜赵桂兰为师。这样，她的挡车技术就全面得到不断的提高，保持了先进。去年12月李弄琴光荣地参加了中国共产党。她说：“我要永远听党的话，保持先进生产者的荣誉，更努力地发挥一个先进生产者的作用，做一个名副其实的共产党员。”
