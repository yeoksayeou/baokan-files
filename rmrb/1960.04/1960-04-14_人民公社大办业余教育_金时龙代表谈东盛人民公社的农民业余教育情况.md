People's Communes Vigorously Develop Spare-Time Education
Delegate Jin Shilong Discusses the Situation of Farmers' Spare-Time Education in the Dongsheng People's Commune

Fellow Delegates,

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the written report submitted to the congress by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I guarantee to resolutely implement them in my work. Our Dongsheng People's Commune in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, like all fraternal ethnic minority regions across the country, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the direct leadership of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee and the Yanbian Prefecture Party Committee, has resolutely implemented the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and the Party's ethnic policies. The broad masses of commune members have demonstrated soaring enthusiasm, and the entire commune has achieved an all-round great leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery.

Now, I would like to report to the congress on the situation of farmers' spare-time education in our Dongsheng People's Commune.

	Actively Implement the Policy of Combining with Production, Unified Arrangement, and Walking on Two Legs

In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, we have actively implemented the policy of combining with production, unified arrangement, and walking on two legs in our commune's farmers' spare-time education work. The entire commune's spare-time education work, driven by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, has made great progress. In particular, after the people's commune was established, it brought unparalleled superior conditions for vigorously developing education, which led to a significant development in the entire commune's education. Currently, the commune has nine publicly-run full-time primary schools, one junior high school, two privately-run part-time agricultural middle schools (including one senior high school class), 130 spare-time primary school classes, 81 junior high school classes, 15 senior high school classes, and one spare-time university. The entire commune now has 4,601 students in full-time and part-time schools, an increase of 22% compared to before the commune was established, and 2,940 students in spare-time schools, an increase of 43% compared to before the commune was established. Among the young and middle-aged people who are learning culture, 2,698 are also participating in spare-time vocational and technical schools learning about tractors, animal husbandry, rice, horticulture, fruit trees, and chicken and duck raising. Among the 3,238 households in the entire commune, a total of 7,541 students are participating in various types of schools, averaging three primary school students for every two households, two middle school students for every three households, and one university student for every thirty households.

The reason why the farmers' education work in our Dongsheng People's Commune has developed so quickly is mainly because the people's commune has opened up broad avenues for vigorously developing education. Because the people's commune has a large scale and wide scope, it is easy to mobilize all positive forces to run education. In the past, agricultural cooperatives were small in scale and weak in strength, and could only manage production and not education. After the commune was established, the organization was large in scale and strong in strength, and it quickly established two agricultural middle schools, enrolling 315 students. They were all elementary school graduates under the age of sixteen who could not continue their education during the time of the advanced agricultural cooperatives. The commune unified the planning of funds, mobilized the masses, and people contributed labor and resources. The masses and students worked together and built school buildings that could accommodate 350 students and dormitories for 100 people in just over a month. 15% of the public welfare fund was also extracted as a spare-time education fund to solve the funding problem. The commune also transferred and hired 15 agricultural middle school teachers and selected 250 teachers for various spare-time schools. The spare-time university hired the commune party secretary to teach political classes, the commune director to teach business management classes, and Lu Genze, a spare-time university student with eight years of rice cultivation experience, to teach rice cultivation technology classes. Teachers from the Yanbian Agricultural College were invited to teach basic courses, and experienced old farmers were invited to guide production practice. The commune members were very satisfied and said, "With the people's commune, running schools is like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each showing their own abilities."

	Collective Welfare Undertakings are Conducive to the Development of Education

The people's commune's establishment of various welfare undertakings has also facilitated the development of education. Because the commune has vigorously established public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, most women have been freed from tedious housework and have more time to participate in spare-time learning. In the past, only 30% of the women in the Dongsheng Management District of our commune (which was an agricultural cooperative at the time) participated in spare-time learning, and even then it was "three days of fishing and two days of drying nets." Now, 76% of the women are able to regularly participate in spare-time learning. In the past, some junior high school and senior high school graduates were the main labor force in their families, and because their economic conditions were not sufficient, they could not attend regular senior high schools or universities. Now they can study while working in the spare-time senior high schools and spare-time universities run by the commune.

	Running Education in the Communes Facilitates the Combination of Education and Productive Labor, and the Combination of Mental and Physical Labor

Running education in the communes facilitates the combination of education and productive labor, and the combination of mental and physical labor. It facilitates the overall arrangement and unified leadership of production and education, so that education serves the needs of production. The people's commune leads both the economy and education, and manages both production and culture and education. The farmers' education work in our commune is under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, and the education work is included in the Party Committee's agenda. In leading education work, the Party Committee first ensures the completion of production tasks, so that learning is closely combined with production and serves production. In terms of the organization of production and learning, the two are unified. Our commune also arranged the learning content according to the needs of production: "Do what, learn what." The integration of politics, culture, and technology was implemented. The commune allocated 14 hectares of paddy fields, 18 hectares of dry land, and 3 hectares of orchards to agricultural middle schools and spare-time universities, as well as ten oxen and three carts, as the students' production base. The students of the spare-time university also formed research groups on crops, plant protection, soil and agricultural chemistry, horticulture, and agricultural machinery according to the production needs of the commune. The rice cultivation technology researched by student Lu Genze has been compiled into "Questions and Answers on Rice Cultivation Technology" and published by the Yanbian Science and Technology Association, which is very popular among the masses. People who originally said that old people in the countryside could not run universities also praised the schools run by the commune, saying that the students taught are able to speak and act, and are both civil and military.

In terms of learning forms, the commune is more convenient to adopt flexible and diverse methods. In the time arrangement of production and education, the principle of "learn more in slack seasons, learn less in busy seasons, and learn flexibly in extremely busy seasons" was resolutely implemented. Therefore, although more than 2,000 young and middle-aged farmers in the entire commune participated in spare-time learning, it not only did not affect productive labor, but also adhered to year-round spare-time learning, achieving the goal of both production and learning without hindering each other. Because the two agricultural middle schools have adhered to part-work and part-study, they have not only achieved economic self-sufficiency, reduced the burden on the commune and parents, but also learned a lot of cultural and scientific knowledge, and improved their cultural level and production capacity.

	The Comprehensive Development of Education Has Greatly Changed People's Spiritual Outlook

The comprehensive development of education has greatly changed people's spiritual outlook and further improved the socialist consciousness of commune members. In particular, after the farmers mastered scientific and cultural knowledge, they more fully exerted their wisdom and talents. They dared to break all old and conservative things, further believed in science, believed in their own strength, and thus better promoted production. In the past, threshing rice had been done for many years by pedaling rice threshers. Three people pedaled one machine, starting early and working late, aching in the back and sore in the legs, and could only thresh 4,000 catties of rice a day. Commune members with culture were completely different. Jin Bingqian, who didn't know a single character in the past, made a animal-powered thresher after attending junior high school, doubling efficiency. The masses improved their scientific and technical level, conservative ideas greatly reduced, and the acceptance of new things was faster. Our commune adopted a series of new technologies and advanced experiences in agricultural production in 1959: reformed the old farming methods, implemented deep plowing; promoted the oil paper warm bed seedling raising method, advanced the rice transplanting period; and promoted the three-by-six, four-corner, and triangular rice close planting methods. It was precisely because of the promotion of this series of new technologies that we overcame difficulties and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. In 1959, the total grain output of the entire commune reached more than 23,163,000 catties, an increase of 16% compared to the bumper harvest of 1958, creating the highest record of grain output in the Hailan River Plain in the past 100 years. The production of the spare-time university was even better. The students, according to the technology they learned, used glass window warm bed seedling raising, transplanted seedlings 20 days in advance, implemented single-row single-irrigation, improved water temperature, and prevented rice blast, and also carried out rational fertilization. Therefore, their crops were the best in the whole commune. The average yield of rice per hectare was 12,760 catties, which was 4,000 catties more than the average yield of the whole commune. They not only achieved a bumper harvest in production, but also made great achievements in learning. At the end of August 1959, the commune spare-time university used the examination questions of Yanbian Agricultural College to conduct final examinations. As a result, among the 46 students who participated in the examination, 7 were excellent, 20 were good, 18 were qualified, and only 1 failed, which was well received by the commune members.

	Training Technical Talents in Various Fields Through Spare-Time Education

Our commune has also trained more than 500 technical talents in various fields such as tractor drivers, agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, fishery, and forestry through spare-time education. They have become the technical backbone on various production fronts. Li Wanyu, who used to be a breeder, actively studied culture and researched veterinary medicine after becoming literate. After several years of hard study, he is now a veterinarian who can treat cattle, horses, sheep, chickens, and rabbits. Lu Genze, who graduated from junior high school eight years ago, has accumulated some experience in rice seedling raising, irrigation, fertilization, and close planting through several years of spare-time study and hard work, and has become a rice cultivation expert in our commune.

The development of education has also enriched the cultural life of the broad masses of commune members. Our commune has a spare-time cultural troupe, each management district has a club, and each team has spare-time actors. Most of the songs and dances performed are self-arranged. In addition, there are 120 newspaper reading groups, and the commune members subscribe to 1,481 newspapers and magazines. The fourteen libraries have a collection of more than 10,000 books. The commune also has a wired broadcasting station with more than 500 loudspeakers, so that commune members can often hear major events at home and abroad.

With the development and improvement of culture and education, the sanitary conditions of the entire commune have greatly improved, sports activities have been widely carried out, and everyone has the habit of paying attention to hygiene. Everyone loves sports, and small-scale sports competitions are often held during the New Year festivals and rest periods. There are many competition events, including football, volleyball, and basketball, as well as activities with national characteristics such as swings, seesaws, and wrestling.

Although the education work of our commune has also made great achievements with the development of industrial and agricultural production, it still cannot adapt to the development of industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, we are determined to continue to carry out mass movements and vigorously develop education under the leadership of the Party, and strive to cultivate the agricultural construction talents needed by the entire commune in the shortest possible time. At the same time, we must set off a new upsurge of learning Chairman Mao's works and learning the languages and characters of fraternal ethnic groups among the broad masses of Korean and Han commune members. We will strive to raise the commune members with junior high school cultural level to the level of university graduates through spare-time education within a few years, so as to create conditions for eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor in the countryside, and make every commune member a new farmer with socialist and communist ideological consciousness and high scientific and cultural knowledge.

    人民公社大办业余教育
    金时龙代表谈东盛人民公社的农民业余教育情况各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告和人大常委会向大会所作的书面报告。并保证在工作中坚决贯彻执行。我们延边朝鲜族自治州的东盛人民公社，和全国各兄弟民族地区一样，在党中央、毛主席的英明领导下，在吉林省委、延边州委的直接领导下，坚决贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线和党的民族政策。广大社员发挥了冲天干劲，全社实现了农林牧副渔全面大跃进。
    现在，我仅就我们东盛人民公社的农民业余教育情况，向大会做个汇报。	积极执行结合生产、统一安排和两条腿走路的方针
    我们公社的农民业余教育工作，几年来在党的领导下，我们积极地执行了结合生产，统一安排和两条腿走路的方针。全社的业余教育工作，在工农业生产大跃进的推动下，有了很大发展，特别是人民公社化后，为大办教育事业带来了无比优越的条件，使全社的教育事业，有了显著的发展，现在全社有公办全日制小学九所，初中一所，民办半日制农业中学两所（包括一个高中班），业余教育有小学一百三十个班，初中八十一个班，高中十五个班，业余大学一所。全社现在有全日制和半日制学校的学生四千六百零一人，比公社化前增加了22％，业余学校学生二千九百四十名，比公社化前增加了43％；在学习文化的青壮年中，有两千六百九十八名还参加了拖拉机、牧畜、水稻、园艺、果树、养鸡鸭等八个业余专业技术学校学习。全社三千二百三十八户中，参加各类学校学习的学生，共有七千五百四十一人，平均每两户有三名小学生，每三户有两个中学生，每三十户有一名大学生。
    我们东盛人民公社的农民教育工作，发展得所以这样快，主要是人民公社为大办教育开辟了广阔的道路。因为人民公社规模大、范围广，便于调动一切积极力量，兴办教育事业。过去农业社规模小、力量弱，只能管生产不能管教育。公社成立后，组织规模大、力量强，很快地就建立了两所农业中学，招收了三百一十五名学生。他们都是高级社时不能升学的十六岁以下的高小毕业生。公社统一筹划资金，发动群众，有人出人，有力出力，群众、学生齐动手，仅用一个多月时间，建成了可容纳三百五十名学生的校舍和一百人用的宿舍。还从公益金中，抽出15％作为业余教育基金，解决了经费问题。公社还调配和聘请了农业中学教师十五名，选拔了各种业余学校教师二百五十名。业余大学聘请公社党委书记讲政治课，社长讲经营管理课，有八年水稻培育经验的业余大学学员吕根泽讲水稻培育技术课，请延边农学院的教师担任基础课，请了有丰富经验的老农做生产实习的指导。社员们很满意地说：“有了人民公社，办学校也能八仙过海，各显其能。”	集体福利事业有利于发展教育事业
    人民公社兴办各种福利事业，也便利了发展教育事业。由于公社大办了公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园，使大多数妇女摆脱了繁琐的家务劳动，能有更多的时间，参加业余学习。过去，我们公社的东盛管理区（当时是一个农业社）的妇女只有30％参加业余学习，而且还是“三天打鱼、两天晒网”。现在有76％的妇女能够经常参加业余学习。过去的初中、高中毕业生，有些是家庭的主要劳动力，因经济条件不充足，不能升正规的高中、大学学习，现在可以在公社办的业余高中、业余大学边生产，边学习了。
    公社办教育，便于教育与生产劳动相结合，脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合
    公社办教育，便于教育与生产劳动相结合，脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合。便于对生产和教育进行全面安排，统一领导，使教育服从生产服务于生产的需要。人民公社既领导经济，又领导教育，既管生产，又管文教。我们公社的农民教育工作，就是在党委统一领导下，把教育工作纳入党委的议事日程。党委在领导教育工作中，首先保证生产任务的完成，使学习紧密结合生产，为生产服务。在生产和学习组织上，做到了二者统一。我们公社还根据生产的需要安排了学习内容：“做什么，学什么”。实行了政治、文化、技术三结合。公社拨给农业中学、业余大学十四公顷水田，十八公顷旱田，三公顷果园，十头耕牛、三辆大车，作为学生的生产基地，业余大学的学生还根据公社生产的需要组成了农作物、植物保护、土壤与农业化学、园艺、农业机械等研究小组。学员吕根泽研究的水稻培育技术，已编写成“水稻栽培技术问答”由延边科学技术协会出版，很受群众欢迎。原来说乡下老不能办大学的人，也称赞公社办学校，教出来的学生，能说能干，文武双全。
    在学习形式上，公社更便于采用灵活多样的方法。在生产和教育的时间安排上，坚决贯彻了“闲时多学，忙时少学，大忙时机动学”的原则。因此，全社虽有两千多名青壮年农民参加了业余学习，不但没有影响生产劳动，而且坚持了常年业余学习，做到了生产学习两不误。两所农业中学，由于坚持了半工半读，不仅实现了经济自给，减轻了公社和家长的负担，并且学到好多文化科学知识，提高了文化水平和生产能力。	教育事业全面发展，人们思想面貌大大改变
    教育事业的全面发展，大大地改变了人们的思想面貌，进一步提高了社员的社会主义觉悟。特别是农民们掌握了科学文化知识后，更加充分发挥了自己的智慧和才能。他们敢于打破一切旧的保守的东西，进一步相信科学，相信自己的力量，从而更好地促进了生产。过去打稻子，多少年来都是用脚蹬打稻机脱粒。三个人蹬一台，起早贪黑，累的腰痛腿酸，一天只能打四千斤稻子。有了文化的社员就截然不同了。过去一个大字不识的金炳千，上了业余初中以后，用了一个冬天的时间，就试制成了一台畜力打稻机，效率提高一倍。群众提高了科学技术水平，保守思想大大减少了，接受新的事物更快了。我们公社在1959年的农业生产中采用了一系列的新技术和先进经验：改革了旧的耕作法，实行了深翻；推广了油纸温床育苗法，提前了插秧期；推行了三乘六式、四角式和三角式的水稻密植。正是由于推广了这一系列的新技术，所以才战胜了困难，获得了空前的大丰收。1959年全社粮食总产量达两千三百一十六万三千多斤，比大丰收的1958年又增长16％。创造了海兰江平原开发一百来年粮食产量的最高纪录。业余大学的生产搞的更好。学生们根据学到的技术，运用了玻璃窗温床育苗，提前二十天插秧，实行了单排单灌，提高了水温，防止了稻热病，同时还进行了合理施肥。因此，他们的庄稼是全社最好的。水稻每公顷平均打一万二千七百六十斤，比全社平均垧产多四千斤。他们不仅在生产上获得了丰收，而且在学习上也取得了很大成绩。1959年8月末，公社业余大学用延边农学院的考试题目，进行期末考试，结果在参加考试的四十六名学生中，七名优等，二十名良好，十八名及格，只有一名不及格，获得了社员群众的好评。	通过业余教育培养出各方面的技术人才
    我们公社通过业余教育，还培养出拖拉机手，农业、园艺、畜牧、渔业、林业等各方面的技术人才五百多名，他们已成为各项生产战线上的技术骨干力量。过去当饲养员的李万玉，从脱盲以后，积极学文化，研究兽医，经过几年的苦学苦钻，现在已经是能给牛、马、羊、鸡、兔治病的兽医了。八年前从初中毕业的吕根泽，经过几年来的业余学习和刻苦钻研，对水稻的育苗、灌水、施肥、密植，都摸到了一些经验，已成为我们公社的水稻栽培专家。
    教育事业的发展，也丰富了广大社员的文化生活。我们公社有业余文工团，各管理区都有俱乐部，队队都有业余演员，演出的歌舞，大部分都是自己编排的。另外，还有一百二十个读报组，全社社员们订了一千四百八十一份报纸和杂志。十四个图书室藏有一万多册书。公社还设了一所有线广播站，有五百多个喇叭，社员们可以常常听到国内外大事。
    随着文化教育的发展与提高，全社的卫生面貌大有改观，体育活动普遍开展，人人都有讲卫生的习惯。人人都爱体育，每到年节和休息的时候，经常地举行小型的体育比赛，比赛的项目也很多，有足球、排球和篮球，也有秋千、跳板、摔跤等具有民族特点的活动。
    我们公社的教育事业，随着工农业生产的发展，虽然也取得很大的成绩，但仍不能适应工农业生产的发展。因此，我们决心在党的领导下，继续大搞群众运动，大办教育事业，争取在最短的时间内，培养出全社所需要的农业建设人材。同时要在朝鲜族和汉族的广大社员中，掀起学习毛主席著作和学习兄弟民族语言、文字的新高潮。力争在几年之内，通过业余教育，把具有初中文化水平的社员，提高到大学毕业的水平，为在农村消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别创造条件，使每个社员都成为具有社会主义、共产主义思想觉悟和有较高的科学、文化知识的新农民。
