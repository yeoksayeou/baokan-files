Xinhua News Agency, April 1st dispatch, Johannesburg: Despite the South African Federal Government's declaration of a "state of emergency" on March 30th and the promulgation of extremely brutal regulations for suppression measures, the people of South Africa have not only not been intimidated, but the scope of their struggle against racial discrimination and persecution continues to expand. On March 31st, more African towns near Johannesburg, an important industrial and commercial center in the north, Cape Town, a major port in the south, and Durban, an important port in the east, erupted in demonstrations.

Near Johannesburg, new demonstrations broke out in Jabba Wu and Natalspruit. A gathering of several hundred people was held in the Jabba Wu area, where speeches were given. Police of the South African white government used batons to beat demonstrators in both Jabba Wu and Natalspruit. In Cato Manor near Durban, African demonstrators demanded the release of their leaders who had recently been arrested by South African authorities. Demonstrators set up roadblocks and angrily threw stones at patrolling police. Police attempted to clear the roadblocks with armored vehicles, but as soon as the armored vehicles passed, the roadblocks were immediately set up again. In Somerset West and Stellenbosch near Cape Town, Africans also held demonstrations against the "pass laws." Police fired on demonstrators in Somerset West and used batons to beat demonstrators in both areas.

In some other areas near Johannesburg, African demonstrators were forced yesterday to resist police persecution. Police fired on the demonstrators, killing one African and wounding three.

At the same time as the demonstrations, South African Africans continue to persist in strike struggles in various places. On the Cape Peninsula, all major construction projects remained at a standstill as Africans refused to work on the 31st. Due to the ongoing strike by African dockworkers since March 28th, the port of Cape Town is congested with many ships unable to load and unload cargo. In Nomisdton, many factories were still forced to close yesterday.

At the same time, the South African Federal white government is also increasingly frantically attempting to quickly extinguish the increasingly fierce and widespread flames of the African people's just struggle. Yesterday, police arrested dozens more members of the African National Congress and other opponents of racial discrimination. The South African authorities also dispatched approximately three thousand fully armed troops, equipped with twenty-two armored vehicles, to surround the African towns of Langa and Nyanga near Cape Town on the night of March 30th, and prohibited local residents from entering or leaving all day yesterday. In the Cape Province, South African authorities yesterday transferred four more "militia groups" of colonialist organizations to suppress the population.

According to a batch of "state of emergency" regulations promulgated by the South African Federal Government on the evening of March 30th, the government has the power to arbitrarily arrest anyone, close down newspapers that "publish subversive statements," prohibit any assembly, and, when necessary, allow the use of firearms or other weapons to "disperse" even legal gatherings, and close down any association that the Minister of Justice considers "subversive." The Minister of Justice is authorized to search and confiscate any publications, records, and recordings if he believes they are "subversive."

Despite this, the Pan-Africanist Congress telegraphed the United Nations headquarters to protest the atrocities of the South African authorities and demanded that the United Nations organization "revoke recognition of the South African white government. It must recognize an interim government representing the majority of the South African people, must order a general election on the basis of one person, one vote, and must determine the date for holding such an election."

Xinhua News Agency, April 1st dispatch, New York: The United Nations Security Council continued to meet on March 31st to discuss the South African Federal Government's large-scale massacre of peaceful residents.

Representatives of Ghana, Guinea, and Jordan, speaking at the morning meeting, condemned the atrocities of the South African Federal Government. Ghanaian representative Quaison-Sackey pointed out that African countries and the world cannot turn a blind eye to the actions of the South African Federal Government. The Ghanaian representative said that the racial policies prevalent in Africa today are the cause of conflict on the continent.

Quaison-Sackey advocated that the Security Council take action to compel the South African government to change its apartheid policies. He said that if the South African government refuses, Ghana will demand that the Security Council impose economic and diplomatic sanctions on the South African government.

Guinean representative Kaba said that South Africa has created a dangerous situation and has grossly violated the United Nations Charter.

Speaking at the morning meeting, British representative Dixon once again defended the South African government. Dixon described the South African government's massacre of Africans as "the undeniable right of any government to maintain law and order in its own territory," and said that the British government "recognizes" this right.

Speaking at the afternoon meeting, Soviet representative Sobolev accused the South African authorities of bloodily shooting peaceful and unarmed demonstrators. He said that racial discrimination in South Africa threatens peace on the African continent and certainly constitutes a threat to international peace.

The Soviet representative said that the Security Council must take immediate action to prevent similar acts of violence and arbitrariness against the African people in the future.

Polish representative Michalowski emphasized in his speech that the Security Council has a responsibility to demand that the South African government end its policy of racial discrimination.

Representatives of France and Italy echoed the position of the British representative in their speeches.

U.S. Representative Lodge is the President of the Security Council for March. He is eager to end the meeting before the end of his term so as to hastily conclude this discussion. But his plans fell through. The Security Council will continue to discuss this issue on April 1st.

    反种族歧视斗争的风暴席卷南非
    南非当局出动大批武装军警对示威者进行血腥镇压
    非洲国家代表要求联合国安全理事会制裁南非政府
    据新华社1日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：尽管南非联邦政府在3月30日宣布“紧急状态”，颁布了极端残暴的镇压措施条例，但是南非人民不但没有被吓倒，而且他们反对种族歧视和迫害的斗争范围还在继续扩大。3月31日这一天，在北部重要工商业中心约翰内斯堡、南部主要港口开普敦和东部重要港口德班的附近都有更多的非洲人城镇爆发了示威。
    在约翰内斯堡附近，有贾巴武和纳塔尔斯普鲁伊特爆发了新的示威。贾巴武地区曾经举行了有几百人参加的集会，会上有人发表演说。南非白人政府的警察在贾巴武和纳塔尔斯普鲁伊特都曾经用棍棒殴打示威者。在德班附近的卡托镇，非洲人示威者要求释放最近被南非当局逮捕的他们的领袖。示威者在那里设置了路障，并且愤怒地向正在巡逻的警察投掷石块。警察企图用装甲车清除路障，但是一当装甲车开过，路障又立即设置起来。在开普敦附近的西索默塞特和斯特伦博希，非洲人也举行示威，反对“通行证法”。警察曾向西索默塞特的示威者开枪，并用棍棒殴打这两个地区的示威者。
    在纳翰内斯堡附近其他一些地区，非洲示威者昨天被迫反抗警察对他们的迫害行为。警察向示威者开了枪，有一名非洲人被打死，三名被打伤。
    在示威斗争的同时，南非非洲人仍在各地坚持举行罢工斗争。在开普半岛，由于非洲人31日仍然拒绝上工，那里所有主要建筑工程继续处于停顿状态。由于非洲码头工人3月28日以来一直在坚持罢工，开普敦港口拥挤了许多不能装货和卸货的船只。在诺密斯敦，许多工厂昨天仍旧被迫关着门。
    同时，南非联邦白人政府也越来越疯狂地企图迅速扑灭非洲人正义斗争的日益炽烈、日益蔓延的火焰。昨天，警察又逮捕了几十名非洲人国民大会的成员和其他反对种族歧视的人。南非当局还派遣了约三千名全付武装的军队，配备着二十二辆装甲车在3月30日夜间包围了开普敦附近的非洲人市镇兰加和尼安加，昨天整天不准当地居民进出。在开普省，南非当局昨天又增调了四个殖民主义者组织的“民兵团”去镇压。
    据南非联邦政府3月30日晚上颁布的一批“紧急状态”条例，政府有权任意逮捕任何人，封闭“发表颠复性声明”的报纸，禁止任何集会，在必要时准许使用枪枝或其他武器“驱散”甚至是合法的集会，封闭任何被司法部长认为是“颠复性”的协会。司法部长受权搜查和没收任何出版物、唱片和录音，如果他认为这些东西是“颠复性”的话。
    尽管如此，泛非主义者大会打电报给联合国总部抗议南非当局的暴行，并且要求联合国组织“撤销承认南非白人政府。它必须承认一个代表大多数南非人民的临时政府，必须命令在一人一票的基础上举行普选，并且确定举行这种选举的日期”。
    据新华社1日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会3月31日继续举行会议，讨论南非联邦政府大规模屠杀和平居民问题。
    在上午会议上发言的加纳、几内亚和约旦等国家代表谴责南非联邦政府的暴行。加纳代表奎森—萨基指出，非洲各国和全世界不能对南非联邦政府的行动置若罔闻。加纳代表说，今天非洲流行白种人优越的种族政策是造成大陆冲突的原因。
    奎森—萨基主张安理会采取行动，责成南非政府改变种族隔离政策。他说，如果南非政府拒绝，加纳将要求安理会对南非政府实行经济和外交制裁。
    几内亚代表卡巴说，南非造成了一种危险局势，并且粗暴地违反了联合国宪章。
    在上午会议上发言的英国代表迪克逊再度为南非政府辩护。迪克逊把南非政府屠杀非洲人的暴行说成是“任何政府在它自己领土上保持法律和秩序的无可争辩的权利”，他说，英国政府“承认”这种权利。
    在下午会议上发言的苏联代表索波列夫指责南非当局对和平和手无寸铁的示威者进行血腥的枪杀。他说，南非的种族歧视威胁着非洲大陆的和平，并且肯定地构成对国际和平的威胁。
    苏联代表说，安理会必须立即采取行动来防止在将来对非洲人民发生类似的强暴专横行为。
    波兰代表米哈沃夫斯基在发言中着重指出，安理会有责任要求南非政府结束种族歧视政策。
    法国和意大利代表在发言中重复英国代表的立场。
    美国代表洛奇是安理会3月份的主席。他急于要使会议在他任期届满之前结束，以便草草了结这一场讨论。但是他的打算落了空。安理会将在4月1日继续讨论这个问题。
