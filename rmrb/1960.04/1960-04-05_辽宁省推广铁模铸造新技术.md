    Liaoning Province Promotes New Iron Mold Casting Technology

    Workers at the Shenyang Jianxing Punching and Shearing Machine Tool Factory and the Chengfa Gate Valve Factory have successfully tested a new iron mold casting technology, opening up a new, faster, better, and more economical path for casting production. The advantages of using this casting method are: First, production efficiency is improved by an average of two to five times, with the highest reaching more than ten times; second, the quality of castings is high; third, the molding area can generally be saved by more than 30%; fourth, raw materials such as pig iron, raw coal, and sand can be greatly saved; fifth, machining allowance is greatly reduced; sixth, labor is greatly saved, achieving increased production with fewer people; seventh, the labor conditions of foundry workers are greatly improved. The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided that all localities in the province with the necessary conditions should immediately promote this experience.

    辽宁省推广铁模铸造新技术
    沈阳建兴冲剪机床厂和成发闸阀厂职工试验成功了铁模铸造的新技术，为铸造生产开辟了一条多快好省的新途径。他们采取这种铸造方法的好处是：一、生产效率平均提高两倍到五倍，最高的达十倍以上；二、铸件质量高；三、造型面积一般可节约30％以上；四、可以大大节约生铁、原煤、砂子等原材料；五、加工余量大大减少；六、大大节省劳动力，做到增产减人；七、大大改善了铸工劳动条件。中共辽宁省委决定，全省凡是有条件的地方，都要立即推广这一经验。
