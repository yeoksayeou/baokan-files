	Jiangsu's Newly Built Water Conservancy Projects Show Great Power
	After a winter and spring of effort, the large number of newly built and renovated water conservancy projects in Jiangsu Province have demonstrated great power in spring plowing and production. More than 300,000 ponds and reservoirs are rippling with clear water, fully storing spring water. In the previous period, the province experienced a long period of sunny weather with little rain. Drought occurred in more than a dozen counties and cities in the northern Xuhuai area. The newly built irrigation projects in these areas demonstrated their power. Rivers, canals, wells, and ponds were used together to bring water to the fields. More than 7 million mu of wheat fields and spring fields affected by drought in these areas were universally and timely irrigated. Currently, the crops are growing vigorously.
	Last winter and this spring, Jiangsu Province built more than 254,000 agricultural water conservancy projects, including small reservoirs, ponds, canals, ditches, embankments, culverts, irrigation areas, and machine-operated wells. The various projects built during the winter and spring have all been fully integrated, expanding the province's irrigated area by nearly doubling compared to last year and improving drainage for more than 16 million mu.
  Anhui Strengthens Summer Field Management
	People's communes in various parts of Anhui Province are vigorously carrying out a field management campaign for summer harvest crops, focusing on preventing diseases, pests, frost, wind, and lodging.
	This year, the growth of summer harvest crops in various parts of Anhui Province is unprecedentedly good, with only 5% of wheat seedlings in the third category throughout the province. This year, the province prepared pesticides and machinery as early as March, strengthened field inspections, and promptly carried out prevention and control measures upon discovering diseases and pests. More than 3,000 local pesticide factories in the Fuyang and Bengbu special districts, which are major wheat-producing areas, have produced more than 21.22 million jin of various local pesticides, timely eliminating the newly emerged wheat rust and wheat spider mites.
	Frost prevention is also an important step to ensure a bumper harvest of summer crops. Since the beginning of spring, the vast masses of the province have successively and victoriously overcome five cold waves.
	Nearly 10 Million People in Hunan Participate in Physical Exercise
	While vigorously promoting the health movement, a mass sports movement centered on radio calisthenics has been vigorously launched in factories, mines, government offices, schools, and rural areas throughout Hunan Province. Currently, nearly 10 million people in the province are participating in various physical exercises.
  Muping County Plants More Peanuts to Support National Construction
	Muping County, Shandong Province, is actively expanding its peanut planting area in accordance with the national plan to ensure the production of more and better peanuts to support national construction.
	This county is a major peanut-producing area. This year, the county party committee, adhering to the spirit of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively advancing, arranged peanut production while arranging grain production. It plans to plant 340,000 mu of peanuts, accounting for 24% of the cultivated land area, an increase of 75% compared to last year, with a planned yield of 500 jin per mu. In order to achieve this plan, the county is earnestly making all preparations to strive for timely planting.
	To expand the peanut planting area without reducing the grain planting area, the county has tightly grasped the effective measures of intercropping, relay cropping, and expanding the multiple cropping area. Groundnuts and soybeans are commonly intercropped in 100,000 mu of spring corn, and corn is commonly intercropped in 440,000 mu of sweet potatoes. The increase in the multiple cropping index has successfully resolved the contradiction between grain and oil crops competing for land.

    要闻快报
    江苏新修水利大显威力
    经过一冬一春的努力，江苏省新建和整修的大量水利工程，已在春耕生产中大显威力。三十多万处塘坝水库，已是清波荡漾，蓄满春水。前一时期，全省久晴少雨，北部徐淮地区的十多个县市发生旱情，这些地区新建的灌溉工程发挥了威力，河、渠、井、塘四水齐用，万水归田，使这些地区的七百余万亩受旱麦田和春田，普遍地及时地得到浇灌，目前庄稼长势茂盛。
    去冬今春，江苏省共建成小型水库、塘坝、渠道、河沟、堤防、涵闸、灌区、机井等农田水利工程二十五万四千多处。冬春兴建的各类工程已全部配套成龙，使全省灌溉面积比去年扩大将近一倍，改善排水面积一千六百多万亩。
  安徽加强夏田管理
    安徽省各地人民公社正大力开展以防病、防虫、防霜、防风、防倒伏为中心的夏收作物田间管理运动。
    今年，安徽省各地的夏收作物生长空前良好，全省小麦三类苗只占5％。全省今年早在3月份以前就准备了农药械，加强田间检查，发现了病虫害即抓紧防治。盛产小麦的阜阳、蚌埠两专区三千多个土农药厂，已生产了各种土农药二千一百二十二万多斤，及时消灭了刚露头的小麦锈病和麦蜘蛛病害。
    防霜冻也是确保夏收作物大丰收的重要关口。全省广大群众自开春以来，已先后胜利地战胜了五次寒潮的侵袭。
    湖南近千万人参加体育锻炼
    湖南省在大搞卫生运动的同时，一个以广播操为中心的群众体育运动，已在全省厂矿、机关、学校、农村如火如荼地开展起来。现在全省已有近一千万人参加了各种体育锻炼。
  牟平县多种花生支援国家建设
    山东牟平县按照国家计划积极扩大花生种植面积，保证生产更多更好的花生支援国家建设。
    这个县是盛产花生的地区。今年县委本着以粮为纲、全面跃进的精神，在安排粮食生产的同时，安排了花生生产。计划播种花生三十四万亩，占耕地面积的24％，比去年扩大75％，计划亩产五百斤。为了实现这个计划，这个县正在认真做好一切准备工作，争取适时播种。
    既扩大花生种植面积，又不减少粮食种植面积，这个县紧紧抓住了间作、套作、扩大复种面积这项有效措施。十万亩春玉米普遍间种地豆、大豆，四十四万亩红薯普遍间种玉米，复种指数的增加，粮、油争地矛盾顺利得到解决。
