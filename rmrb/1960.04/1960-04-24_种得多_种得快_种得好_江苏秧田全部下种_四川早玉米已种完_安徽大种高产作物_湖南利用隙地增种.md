Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd -- A high tide of spring plowing and planting production movement has formed in various parts of Jiangsu. By April 15th, all 630,000 mu of early rice seedling fields in the province had been sown; spring sweet potatoes were planted and seedlings were raised about a month earlier than in previous years, with large-scale sowing and seedling raising starting in mid- to late February. According to statistics from some time ago, a total of more than 1.5 million sweet potato seedling hotbeds were built throughout the province, nearly three times more than last year, and those sown earlier have already begun to cut seedlings for trial planting; early corn was sown on 5,260,000 mu by the Qingming Festival, while in previous years sowing only began at Qingming; cotton, oilseed, flax, tobacco, and sugar crops have also fully entered the high tide of sowing. Siyang County has completed the planting of 200,000 mu of spring cotton, 10 days earlier than last year.

Upholding high standards and setting examples at every level is a characteristic of this year's spring planting. At the beginning of spring planting, cadres at all levels went deep into the front line of spring planting to carry out trial planting at each level and set up pacesetters. More than 500,000 people in Huaiyin Prefecture participated in trial planting. Through trial planting, understanding was unified, and sowing specifications were unified. During spring planting, various localities also adopted the experience of summer crop management, implementing simultaneous planting and management, and managing as soon as planting was done. In the southern Jiangsu region, as soon as early rice seedlings were sown, the masses built sheds in the fields to guard day and night against frost and freezing. Each commune in Nantong Prefecture has established more than 18,000 professional corn field management teams, with more than 210,000 people participating, to strengthen the seedling management of spring corn in a timely manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 23rd -- Spring sowing in Anhui is in full swing. The broad masses of commune members are trying every possible means to achieve early sowing, fast sowing, and good sowing, resolutely implement the "five expansions" increase production measures, and lay a solid foundation for the continued leap forward in agricultural production this year.

The "five expansions" increase production measures implemented in Anhui this year—expanding cultivated land area, expanding spring sowing area, expanding multiple cropping index, expanding high-yield crop area, and expanding improved varieties—are mutually restrictive and mutually promoting. In addition to reclaiming more than 7 million mu of wasteland to expand cultivated land, the other four aspects must be achieved through sowing. Therefore, all localities are currently prioritizing "sowing," dispatching large numbers of cadres to the countryside to lead the people's communes in vigorously grasping spring sowing. In sowing, all localities first focus on high-yield crops. The high-yield crops such as rice, sweet potatoes, and corn that are prepared to be planted throughout the province this spring will account for about 70% of the spring sowing area; these high-yield crops will be expanded by 17 million mu compared to last year. Now, the members of the people's communes in Huainan and the areas along the Yangtze River are rushing to plow paddy fields and transport base fertilizer. All early rice seedling fields have fixed professional teams to strengthen management, and in the early areas, transplanting has already begun. In the Huaibei area, more than 3 million mu of spring rice fields have been leveled, 90% of the fields have been fertilized with base fertilizer, and more than 80,000 mu of spring rice has been sown for seedling raising. The seedlings of spring sweet potatoes throughout the province have basically been raised, and most of them are the "Victory No. 100" improved variety of sweet potatoes. Now, various localities have prepared more than 6.3 million mu of sweet potato ridges, and the first batch of more than 120,000 mu of spring sweet potatoes has been cut and transplanted. The members of the seedling raising professional teams are guarding more than 600,000 hotbeds day and night, adding fertilizer and water to the sweet potato seedlings, and striving to cut and transplant more. 1,690,000 mu of spring corn has been planted throughout the province. While focusing on high-yield crops, small grains, small oilseeds, and melons and vegetables have also been planted by making full use of field corners, ponds, dikes, slopes, and young orchards, effectively expanding the spring sowing area.

The progress of sowing various cash crops is also very fast. Now, more than 2,040,000 mu of spring cotton has been planted throughout the province. Xiao County and Dangshan County, the two key cotton-producing counties, have completed the spring cotton planting plan ahead of schedule. Spring tobacco, oilseeds, hemp, and other crops have all been sown ahead of schedule. Fengyang and Dingyuan, the key tobacco-producing counties, have begun transplanting spring tobacco. More than 350,000 mu of hemp have been planted throughout the province, and field management is being strengthened.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 22nd -- People's communes in various parts of Sichuan have completed the early corn sowing plan ahead of schedule. By the beginning of April, more than 8 million mu of early corn had been sown throughout the province, an area that has doubled compared to last year. The sowing quality has been greatly improved compared with previous years. Generally, deep plowing is carried out to about one chi, and the base fertilizer is also more than last year. More than 80% of the cornfields have implemented advanced directional close planting technology. Many areas have used vacant land to increase planting of a large number of "corn kings." At present, all localities are making persistent efforts to strengthen management, ensure that the seedlings are even, complete, and strong, and lay a good foundation for high yields and bumper harvests.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 22nd -- Various parts of Hunan have adopted the method of seizing every opportunity to make use of spare land, planting various crops. Since the beginning of spring, 2.8 million mu of idle land have been planted throughout the province, of which there are more than 1 billion pumpkin seedlings alone. At the same time, 4,513,000 mu of grain crops have been interplanted in forest land.

In order to mobilize the masses to make full use of idle land, various localities have carried out surveys and accounting work, and clearly defined the scope of operations. In general, large pieces of land are planted by production teams according to their circumstances; small pieces of scattered land in front of and behind houses that are inconvenient for production teams to manage are operated by commune members, provided that it does not affect collective production. In this way, the enthusiasm of all parties has been fully mobilized, and the idle land that can be utilized has been utilized.

After the survey and planning, various localities have been raising seeds and accumulating fertilizer on the one hand, and organizing labor to rush planting on the other. Dongfeng Commune in Changde County has opened up 560 mu of river island sandy land to sow peanuts. The Nongfeng Brigade of this commune dispatched 174 laborers, formed seven groups, and prepared the land while sowing, verifying the quality of each mu that was planted, and the 145 mu of peanuts that had been planted met the quality requirements. This year, the Matian Commune in Yongxing County plans to expand the area of intercropping between forests and grain from more than 32,000 mu last year to 60,000 mu. According to this plan, the entire commune implements "five-to-the-mountain" for varieties, time, fertilizer, output, and responsibility, and organized 10,000 people to rush planting on the mountain. In two days, the Zimu Brigade rushed to plant more than 510 mu of miscellaneous grain crops such as spring buckwheat, potatoes, corn, and millet. The planted crops have been fixed for special personnel to cultivate, so as to achieve simultaneous planting and management.

    种得多　种得快　种得好
    江苏秧田全部下种　四川早玉米已种完
    安徽大种高产作物　湖南利用隙地增种
    据新华社南京23日电　江苏各地春耕春种大生产运动已形成高潮。到4月15日，全省六十三万多亩早稻秧田已经全部落谷；春山芋比往年提早一个月左右，在2月中、下旬就大量下种育秧。据前些时统计，全省共建山芋育秧温床一百五十多万个，比去年增加近三倍，早下种的已开始剪苗试插；早玉米到清明止就播种了五百二十六万亩，而往年清明才开始播种；棉花、油料、麻、烟和糖料作物也全面进入播种高潮。泗阳县二十万亩春棉已经种完，比去年提前十天。
    坚持高标准、层层做样子，是今年春播的特点。春播开始时，各地各级干部深入春播第一线，层层试播，树立标兵。淮阴专区参加试播的有五十多万人。通过试播，统一认识，统一了播种规格。在春播中，各地还接受了夏熟作物管理经验，实行边种边管、一种就管。苏南地区早稻秧田一下种，群众就在田头搭棚，日夜看守，防霜防冻。南通专区各公社已建立玉米田间管理专业队一万八千多个，有二十一万多人参加，及时加强了春玉米的苗期管理。
    新华社合肥23日电　安徽春播全面展开。广大社员正在千方百计地做到早播、快播、播好，坚决贯彻实现“五扩大”的增产措施，为今年农业生产继续跃进奠定基础。
    安徽今年实行的扩大耕地面积、扩大春播面积、扩大复种指数、扩大高产作物面积和扩大良种的“五扩大”增产措施，是相互制约、相互促进的。各地除开荒扩大耕地七百多万亩以外，其余四个方面都要通过播种来实现。因此，各地当前都以“种”字当头，抽调大批干部下乡，领导人民公社狠抓春播工作。在播种中，各地首先大抓高产作物。全省今春准备种植的水稻、甘薯、玉米等高产作物，将占春播面积70％左右；这些高产作物将比去年扩大一千七百万亩。现在淮南和沿江地区的人民公社社员，正在抢犁水田，赶运基肥，所有早稻秧田都固定了专业队加强管理，早的地方，已经开始栽秧。在淮北地区，已有三百多万亩春稻田打好了田埂，90％的田都施了基肥，春稻已播种育秧八万多亩。全省春甘薯的秧苗已基本育齐，而且绝大部分都是“胜利百号”良种甘薯。现在各地已扶好甘薯垅六百三十多万亩，第一批春甘薯十二万多亩已剪栽下去，育苗专业队的社员们，正日夜守候在六十多万个温床边，给甘薯秧加肥添水，力争多剪多栽。春玉米全省已种下一百六十九万亩。在大抓高产作物的同时，还充分利用田头地角、塘、埂、堤坡、幼林果园，种植了小杂粮、小油料和瓜菜等，有效地扩大了春播面积。
    各种经济作物播种进度也很快，现在全省春棉已种下二百零四万多亩，萧县、砀山两个重点产棉县，已提前完成了春棉种植计划。春烟、油料、麻类等作物都已提前播种，凤阳、定远等重点产烟县，春烟已开始移栽，麻类全省已种下三十五万多亩，正在加强田间管理。
    据新华社成都22日电　四川各地人民公社提前完成早玉米播种计划。到4月上旬，全省已播种早玉米八百多万亩，面积比去年成倍增加。播种质量比往年大大提高，一般都深耕一尺左右，底肥也比去年多，80％以上的玉米地都贯彻了定向密植先进技术。许多地区利用空闲土地增种了大批“玉米王”。目前，各地正一鼓作气，加强管理，保证苗齐苗全苗壮，为高产丰收打下良好基础。
    据新华社长沙22日电　湖南各地采取见缝插针的办法，充分利用闲散土地，种植各种农作物。入春以来，全省已种闲散土地二百八十万亩，其中仅南瓜就有十亿多蔸。同时，还在林地里间种粮食作物四百五十一万三千亩。
    为了发动群众充分利用闲散土地，各地都进行了调查摸底和算账工作，并明确划分经营范围。成块的一般分别情况交生产队种植；那些面积很小、生产队不便于经营的屋前屋后的零星土地，在不影响集体生产的原则下，交由社员经营。这样，就充分调动了各方面的积极因素，把能够利用的闲散土地利用起来。
    在经过调查和规划之后，各地都一面筹集种子、增积肥料，一面组织劳动力突击抢种。常德县东风公社开辟了五百六十亩河洲沙地播种花生。这个公社的农丰大队出动一百七十四个劳力，编成七个小组，边整地、边播种，种好一亩，验收一亩，已种的一百四十五亩花生丘丘合乎质量要求。永兴县马田公社今年计划林粮间作面积由去年的三万二千多亩扩大到六万亩。根据这个计划全社实行品种、时间、肥料、产量、责任“五到山”，共组织了一万人上山突击抢种。梓木大队两天就抢种春荞、洋芋、玉米、小米等杂粮作物五百一十多亩，已种的作物都固定了专人培育，做到边种边管。
