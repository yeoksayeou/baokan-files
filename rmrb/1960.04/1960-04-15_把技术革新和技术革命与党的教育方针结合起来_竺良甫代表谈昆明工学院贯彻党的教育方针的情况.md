Comrades and Representatives:
I completely agree with and wholeheartedly endorse the reports made by the two Vice Premiers Li.

1958 marked the beginning of a new historical period for our country's socialist construction. Based on the developmental requirements of this new historical period, the Party Central Committee systematically proposed the educational policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. At that time, some people doubted whether this would affect the quality of education. Facts are always the most persuasive. After a year and six months, the result of implementing the Party's educational policy has been a profound revolution in our country's education and unprecedented great achievements. Once education is combined with productive labor, it has such an effect. Then, the development of technological innovation and technological revolution movements closely integrated with production will undoubtedly deepen the educational revolution and further improve the quality of education. I would like to review the achievements of the in-depth educational revolution last year, which has practical significance. Kunming Institute of Technology, like other universities across the country, under the strong leadership of the Party, put politics in command, continued to implement the Party's educational policy, continued to focus on training cadres, and simultaneously conducted scientific research and small-scale production, further strengthening the integration of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. On the basis of the tremendous achievements made in 1958, these three aspects continued to achieve even greater successes.

    Graduation Design Combined with Actual Production

From the teaching perspective, I believe that the quality of teaching should be measured by graduation design, because graduation design is the point of integration of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research – a "three-way combination". Last year, the graduation designs of all majors in our institute were carried out in conjunction with the actual production of relevant factories and mines, truly and practically. Taking mining engineering as an example, the graduation design was conducted in the mines in conjunction with the production tasks of the mines. The design topics were jointly formulated by the mines and the school, fully reflecting the organic combination of teaching, production, and scientific research. The design quality generally met the requirements of technical construction. Among them, more than 65% of the thematic parts of the design have been adopted by the mines, and the mines gave high praise to the students' designs. How can this be compared with the quality of graduation design in the past, which involved "turning a deaf ear to things outside the window and focusing only on professional books" and engaging in empty talk?

    Productive Labor Cultivates Labor Habits

Secondly, from the perspective of productive labor, productive labor is basically carried out in accordance with the provisions of the professional education plan and the requirements of the labor program. Over the past year, students throughout the school have worked a total of more than 142,000 labor days. After adjustments, there are a total of twelve self-run factories, producing many products with an industrial output value of more than 400,000 yuan, exceeding the target set by the Kunming Municipal Planning Commission. Social public welfare labor accounts for about one-fifth of the total labor time, supporting industrial and agricultural production, such as supporting autumn harvesting and planting in factories and mines and state-owned farms near the school. In response to the call of the Municipal Party Committee, more than 130 mu of vegetables were produced on campus, and more than 400 mu of feed base for pig raising was opened in Baiyuko. Teachers, students, and technicians of the Mechanical Engineering Department assembled a tractor and manufactured rice washing machines, cooking boilers, vegetable washing machines, and vegetable cutting machines for the mechanization of catering work. Through productive labor, political awareness has been raised and ideological sentiments have undergone significant changes. For example, students in two majors of the Department of Metallurgy, when supporting factories and mines, greatly exceeded the quota set by the factory in terms of labor quantity and quality, and their organization and discipline were very strong, constantly receiving praise from the factory. What does this show? This shows that through the Great Leap Forward in Steel in 1958, on the one hand, the students were tempered and cultivated labor habits and collective viewpoints, and on the other hand, they also learned steelmaking and ironmaking techniques.

    Productive Labor Promotes Scientific Research

Thirdly, from the perspective of scientific research, the past year's productive labor has further promoted scientific research work. The Mechanical Engineering Department successfully designed and trial-produced a universal grinder. The Wenshan Geological Team of the Department of Geology completed geological maps of 1,800 square kilometers at a scale of 1:50,000, geological maps of 70 square kilometers at a scale of 1:10,000, and geological maps of 1 square kilometer at a scale of 1:1,000 in two months, and submitted regional geological reports, mining geological reports, and scientific research reports such as rock and paleontology identification descriptions. Some research work with huge workloads that were previously unimaginable, such as the comprehensive research on Yunnan strata and the design of the Kunyang Phosphate Mine, have made great achievements under the leadership of the Party. Last year, on the tenth anniversary of National Day, more than 130 scientific research projects were presented to the Party. At the beginning of this year, the Party Committee conveyed the spirit of the Central Scientific Research Conference, setting off a vigorous mass movement. Teachers, students, and staff throughout the school put forward more than 250 key projects and more than 2,000 general projects. Now, in accordance with the principle of combining key and general, and combining popularization and improvement, each department is strengthening cooperation with factories and mines and scientific research institutions outside the school, and breaking the boundaries between departments and teaching and research groups within the school, and striving to cooperate. We believe that under the strong leadership of the Party, putting politics in command, carrying out a large-scale mass movement, and strengthening communist cooperation, this scientific research task will definitely be completed outstandingly.

  Integrating the Current Technological Innovation and Technological Revolution Movement with the Educational Policy

Based on the above, recalling the facts of the past year, it once again proves that education must be combined with productive labor. At this meeting, Vice Premier Li Fuchun said: "The central content of the current technological innovation and technological revolution movement on various fronts is to closely combine with production and gradually realize mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation. This is a great mass movement with broad participation." Then, will the development of this movement lead the socialist education cause to a higher level of development? Will people's mental outlook undergo greater changes? Regarding this question, Vice Premier Li has given a more comprehensive and affirmative answer in his report. He said: "This movement will surely accelerate the process of modernization of industry, agriculture, and science and culture in our country, further increase the speed of socialist construction, and further improve the communist consciousness and scientific, technological, and cultural level of the people."

Technological innovation and technological revolution are endless. If you can do it with indigenous methods, do it with indigenous methods; if you can do it with foreign methods, do it with foreign methods; if you can combine indigenous and foreign methods, do it with indigenous and foreign methods. It is truly "the sea is wide for fish to leap, and the sky is high for birds to fly." Using various methods and equipment will create advanced, precise, and cutting-edge new products, and will write an extraordinarily brilliant page in the history of science and technology. And if the indigenous, foreign, combination of indigenous and foreign, high, precise, and cutting-edge new creations and technologies are tested, researched, summarized, improved, incorporated into process procedures, and absorbed into teaching, wouldn't that greatly enrich and improve the quality of teaching? Lenin said: "We cannot raise teaching and education divorced from productive labor, or productive labor divorced from corresponding teaching and education, to the level required by modern technology and the current state of scientific knowledge." Therefore, there is no doubt that integrating the current technological innovation and technological revolution with the Party's educational policy will further improve the quality of teaching and education.

In the past two years, the "one major and two minor, three-way combination" proposed by the Party has played a great role, that is, scientific research institutions focus on scientific research, while simultaneously training cadres and engaging in small-scale production; universities and secondary vocational schools focus on training cadres, while simultaneously conducting scientific research and small-scale production; production enterprises focus on production, while simultaneously conducting scientific research and training cadres; and scientific research institutions, schools, and production enterprises must be closely integrated. In the future, Vice Premier Li Fuchun said: "We must develop technological innovation in individual processes and individual workshops into technological innovation in the entire process and the entire enterprise." Also, "We must 'match up' the experiences of various technological innovations in similar enterprises to form complete sets of experiences and systematic experiences, so that technological innovation is serialized." In this way, in the technological innovation, thousands upon thousands of comprehensive scientific research topics with huge workloads will be put forward, and it will be necessary to organize forces from all aspects to study. Scientific research institutions, schools, and production enterprises will be more closely integrated, working together to climb the peaks of world science and technology.

Therefore, the school dispatches a certain number of teachers and students to participate in agricultural technology transformation or to production enterprises to participate in technological innovation and technological revolution movements, humbly learning from workers and peasants, and at the same time summarizing and improving the rich experience created by the workers and peasants. This will inevitably make scientific theory and production practice, intellectuals and workers and peasants, mental labor and physical labor more closely combined. Of course, in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, there is no lack of struggle. Because the movement itself is a struggle between the new and the old, the advanced and the backward, the revolutionary and the conservative. The struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology, and the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road will inevitably be reflected in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. Only by allowing the vast number of teachers and students to participate in this vigorous and ever-changing movement can they be educated, thereby cultivating the working class's class viewpoint, mass viewpoint, and collective viewpoint, labor viewpoint, and dialectical materialist viewpoint. Wouldn't that deepen the educational revolution a step further? Wouldn't the Party's educational policy be further implemented?

"While continuing to complete the socialist revolution on the economic front, the political front, and the ideological front, gradually realizing the technological revolution and the cultural revolution" is one of the basic points of the general line for socialist construction, and is Mao Zedong Thought. In ancient China, intelligence and talent seemed to be concentrated only on Shun or Yao, but the wisdom of the liberated 600 million people is infinite. Chairman Mao has a poem that says: "Spring breeze and willows in thousands of strands, six hundred million divine continents are all Shun and Yao." We should strive to study Chairman Mao's works, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and together with the people of the whole country, establish great ambitions, be determined, use our brains, and create boldly. Isn't each one of us Shun, and isn't each one of us Yao?

### 把技术革新和技术革命与党的教育方针结合起来  竺良甫代表谈昆明工学院贯彻党的教育方针的情况

专栏：

    把技术革新和技术革命与党的教育方针结合起来
    竺良甫代表谈昆明工学院贯彻党的教育方针的情况各位代表：
    两位李副总理所作报告，我完全同意和衷心的拥护。
    1958年是我国社会主义建设进入了一个新的历史时期。根据新的历史时期发展的要求，党中央对我国教育事业系统地提出了教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针。当时某些人怀疑这样是否会影响教育质量。事实总是最有说服力。经过一年零六个多月的时间，党的教育方针贯彻执行的结果，我国教育事业进行了深刻的革命，取得了空前未有的伟大成就。教育一经与生产劳动相结合就发生如此的效果，那末，与生产密切结合的技术革新和技术革命运动的开展，毫无疑问，必然要使教育革命更加深入，教育质量还要更上一层楼的提高。我想回顾一下去年的深入教育革命的成就是具有现实意义的。昆明工学院和全国其他大学一样，在党的坚强领导下，政治挂帅，继续贯彻党的教育方针，继续以培养干部为主，同时进行科学研究和小规模的生产，进一步密切了教学、生产劳动和科学研究三者之间的结合。这三者都在1958年取得巨大成就的基础上，继续获得了更大的成绩。毕业设计结合实际生产
    从教学方面来讲，教学质量的高低，我以为应当从毕业设计来衡量，因为毕业设计是教学、生产劳动和科学研究“三结合”的结合点。去年我院各个专业的毕业设计都是结合有关厂矿的实际生产，真刀真枪地来进行的。譬如以采矿专业为例，毕业设计是结合矿山的生产任务在矿山进行的，设计题目由矿山及学校双方共同拟定，充分反映了教学、生产和科学研究的有机结合。设计质量一般都达到了技术施工的要求，其中设计的专题部分有65％以上已被矿山所采用，矿山对学生的设计给予很高的评价。这岂能与过去“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读业务书”，纸上谈兵来进行毕业设计的质量，所可同日而语吗？
        生产劳动培养劳动习惯
    其次从生产劳动来讲，生产劳动基本上是按专业教育计划的规定和劳动大纲的要求来进行的。一年来全校同学共计劳动了十四万二千多个劳动日，自办工厂经调整后共有十二个，生产了不少产品，工业产值达四十万元以上，超额完成了昆明市计委下达任务的指标。社会公益劳动约占全部劳动时间五分之一，支援了工农业生产，如支援学校附近的厂矿和国营农场的秋收、秋种等。为了响应市委的号召，还在校内进行了蔬菜生产一百三十余亩，在白鱼口地方开辟了养猪的饲料基地四百余亩。机械系师生和技工装配了一台拖拉机，并为炊事工作机械化制造了淘米机、煮饭用锅炉、洗菜机、切菜机等。通过生产劳动政治觉悟提高了，思想感情有了显著的变化。例如冶金系两个专业的学生在支援厂矿时，劳动的数量方面和质量方面都大大超过了厂方的定额，组织性和纪律性也很强，不断得到厂方的表扬。这说明什么问题呢？这就说明了通过1958年大炼钢铁，一方面使同学受到了锻炼，培养了劳动习惯和集体观点，另一方面也学到了炼钢炼铁的技术。
        生产劳动推动科学研究
    再其次从科学研究方面来讲，在去年一年的生产劳动中，更进一步地推动了科学研究工作。机械系设计试制成功了万能磨床；地质系文山地质队在两个月的时间内完成了五万分之一的地质图一千八百多平方公里，万分之一的地质图七十平方公里，千分之一的地质图一平方公里，送交了区域地质报告，矿山地质报告和岩石、古生物鉴定说明书等科学研究的报告。有些过去连想都不敢想的工作量巨大的研究工作，如云南地层的综合研究，昆阳磷矿设计等总干在党的领导下已经做出了很大的成绩。去年国庆十周年时，向党献礼科学研究项目达一百三十余项。今年年初党委传达了中央科学研究会议的精神，掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，全校师生员工共提出了重点项目二百五十余项，一般项目二千余项。现在各系本着重点和一般相结合，普及和提高相结合的原则，在校外加强与厂矿和科学研究机关的协作，在校内又打破系与系、教研组与教研组之间的界线，努力合作。我们相信在党的坚强领导下，政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，加强共产主义大协作，这一科学研究任务是一定能够出色完成的。
  把当前的技术革新和技术革命运动
        同教育方针结合起来
    根据以上所述，回忆一年来的事实，再一次证明了教育必须与生产劳动相结合。在这次会议上，李富春副总理说：“当前各个战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动，中心内容是与生产密切结合，逐步实现机械化和半机械化、自动化和半自动化。这是一个具有广泛群众性的伟大运动”。那末这一运动的开展，会不会使社会主义教育事业引向更高发展道路上去呢？人的精神面貌会不会发生更大的变化呢？对于这一问题，李副总理在报告中已作了更全面的肯定的回答。他说：“这个运动必将加快我国工业现代化、农业现代化和科学文化现代化的进程，进一步提高社会主义建设的速度，进一步提高人民群众的共产主义觉悟和科学技术文化水平。”
    技术革新和技术革命是没有止境的。能搞土的就搞土，能搞洋的就搞洋，搞土洋结合就搞土洋结合。真是“海阔凭鱼跃，天空任鸟飞”。运用各种各样办法和设备将会制造出高级的、精密的、尖端的新产品，将会在科学技术史上写出异常光辉灿烂的一页。而把土的、洋的、土洋结合的和高的、精的、尖端的新创造、新技术加以试验，加以研究，加以总结提高，纳入工艺规程，吸收到教学方面来，那不就大大丰富和提高教学质量了吗？列宁说过：
  “我们不可能把脱离生产劳动的教学和教育或者把脱离相应的教学和教育的生产劳动，提到现代技术水平和科学知识现状所要求的那种高度。”所以把当前的技术革新和技术革命与党的教育方针结合起来一定能进一步提高教学和教育质量是毫无疑问的。
    在过去两年中，党提出的“一主二从三结合”发挥了很大的力量，即科学研究机关以科学研究为主，同时进行培养干部和小规模的生产，在高等学校和中等专业学校以培养干部为主，同时进行科学研究和小规模的生产；在生产企业中以生产为主，同时进行科学研究和培养干部；而科学研究机关、学校和生产企业又要密切的结合。今后，李富春副总理说：“要把单个工序、单个车间的技术革新发展成为整个工序，整个企业的技术革新。”又“要把同类企业的各种技术革新的经验‘配起套’来，形成成套的经验，形成系统的经验，使技术革新系列化。”这样在技术革新当中一定会提出千千万万的工作量巨大的综合性的科学研究课题，而需要组织各方面力量来研究，科学研究机关、学校和生产企业将会结合得更加密切，共同努力，攀登世界科学技术的高峰。
    因此，学校调派一定数量的教师和学生去参加农业技术改造或者到生产企业中去参加技术革新和技术革命运动，虚心向工人农民学习，同时总结提高工农群众创造的丰富经验，这样必然使科学理论和生产实践，知识分子和工农群众，脑力劳动和体力劳动更加密切地结合起来。当然在技术革新和技术革命运动中，不是没有斗争的。因为这一运动的本身就是新的与旧的，先进的与落后的，革命的与保守的斗争。无产阶级思想与资产阶级思想的斗争，社会主义道路与资本主义道路的斗争也不可避免地要反映到技术革新和技术革命运动中来。只有让广大师生参加到轰轰烈烈，瞬息万变的这一运动中去，才能受到教育，从而培养工人阶级的阶级观点、群众观点和集体观点、劳动观点、辩证唯物主义观点。那教育革命不就更加深入了一步吗？党的教育方针不就得到更进一步的贯彻吗？
    “在继续完成经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的同时，逐步实现技术革命和文化革命”是社会主义建设总路线的基本点之一，是毛泽东思想。中国古代，聪明才智好像只集中在舜或者尧的身上，而解放了的六亿人民的智慧是无穷无尽的。毛主席有诗说：“春风杨柳万千条，六亿神洲尽舜尧。”我们应当努力学习毛主席著作，在毛泽东思想的指导下，和全国人民一道树雄心，立壮志，开动脑筋，大胆创造，难道那一个不就是舜，那一个不就是尧吗？
