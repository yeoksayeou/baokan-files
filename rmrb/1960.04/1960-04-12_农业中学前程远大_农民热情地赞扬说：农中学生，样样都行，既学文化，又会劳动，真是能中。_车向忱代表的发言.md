Agricultural Middle Schools Have Bright Prospects
The peasants enthusiastically praised: Agricultural middle school students are good at everything. They learn culture and do labor. They are really capable.
Speech by Delegate Che Xiangchen

Fellow Delegates:
	I fully agree with the Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960 made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun to the Congress; the Report on the State's Final Accounts for 1959 and the Draft State Budget for 1960 made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian; and the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, as well as the report made by Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin on striving to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. I am willing to resolutely implement the above reports.
	From these reports, it can be clearly seen that the great achievements of our people in socialist construction under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are rapidly changing our country's "poor and blank" face, and have laid a solid foundation for the continued great leap forward in 1960. This gives us strength and confidence.
	Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, and under the correct leadership of the Party and government at the provincial, municipal, county, and people's commune levels, Liaoning Province's education work has conscientiously implemented the Party's policies of "education serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor" and "walking on two legs," and the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party of "opposing rightism and boosting morale." Over the past year, the province's education undertaking has undergone significant development and improvement, based on the overall arrangement and rectification, consolidation, and enhancement. Currently, most cities in our province have universities, every county has high schools, every commune has junior high schools, and every team has primary schools and kindergartens. Spare-time schools are even more numerous, forming a relatively complete education system across the province. The great development of education in 1958 and 1959 laid a good foundation for this year's continued great development.

	Agricultural Middle Schools are a New Thing, an Unprecedented Initiative
	In the new stage of educational development, agricultural middle schools are a new thing. They came about with the people's communes. They are an unprecedented initiative and an inevitable result of historical development. They are products of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, the masses of peasants enthusiastically support and strongly back agricultural middle schools.
	Now, I will talk about my inspection of the agricultural middle schools in Xinmin County, Liaoning Province, in mid-March:
	Under the direct leadership of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee and the Xinmin County Party Committee, the agricultural middle schools in Xinmin County have grown from three or five to the current sixty, with more than 11,000 students. On average, there are seven schools in each commune, and almost every team has an agricultural middle school, achieving basic universal access. Students can attend school locally. The schools are all part-work, part-study, full-time schools. They all have fixed school buildings, productive labor bases, teaching and production equipment, which are gradually being enriched. They have also established normal teaching and production order, and the quality of education is constantly improving. The students have already mastered, to varying degrees, the planting and cultivation of crops such as dryland crops, paddy fields, and vegetables; the raising of livestock and poultry; general scientific research and management of animals and plants; and labor skills such as sideline weaving. Teachers and students are working diligently and with full confidence, and under the leadership of the Party, the agricultural middle schools are increasingly demonstrating their strong vitality and their important role.

	The Direction of Running Schools is to Serve Agricultural Production
	The direction of running agricultural middle schools is in line with serving agricultural production. Since the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee convened a field meeting on agricultural middle schools in Xinmin County in the fall of 1959, deciding that agricultural middle schools must further implement the cultivation of a large number of technical personnel for the "four modernizations" of agriculture, the direction of each school has become clearer and the path wider. In just the next two years, the county will be able to deliver more than 7,000 urgently needed primary and intermediate agricultural scientific and technical personnel to the agricultural front. For example, the Chapeng’an Agricultural Middle School in the county, under this instruction, and with the support of the commune Party committee, has linked up with the mechanized farming team nearby and opened an agricultural machinery class, with the technical personnel of the mechanized farming team serving as lecturers. The thirty-eight third-year students who are graduating this summer can now drive and master tractors and various agricultural machines. Before graduation, they can fully achieve theoretical understanding, operational proficiency, and general repair capabilities. Another example is the Xiaozhaotun Agricultural Middle School. When the students saw that the commune members were using heavy curtains to thresh grain, which was inefficient and could not complete the task on time, the teachers and students researched and trial-produced a threshing machine. The students who had mastered internal combustion engines actively participated and finally completed the task ahead of schedule. Students from agricultural middle schools in various places have also learned to master certain technologies and, in accordance with local conditions, have linked up with local vegetable gardens, farms, breeding farms, aquaculture, and power plants. These units are responsible for everything from technical theory to on-site teaching, and the school is responsible for organizing students to go to the linked units for labor on time and as needed. Practice over the past two years has proven that the effect is very good, mutually satisfactory, and plays a greater role in promoting the "four modernizations" of agriculture.

	Agricultural Middle School Teachers Fully Emphasize Human Subjective Initiative
	The county achieved universal junior high school education in 1958, allowing more than 90% of primary school graduates to enter junior high school. With such part-time middle schools run by the masses themselves, the needs of their children to continue their studies are better met. The number of students in the county's agricultural middle schools is 13% more than the number of full-time regular middle school students. Through the close combination of learning and productive labor, the agricultural middle school students have raised their socialist and communist awareness and established the ideological feeling of loving agricultural production labor and loving the new countryside. More significantly, due to the implementation of the principle of combining teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, 60% of the county's agricultural middle schools have approached and caught up with the achievements of general full-time junior high schools in major subjects such as Chinese and mathematics. Under the circumstances that the quality of teachers and their professional level were not high, and the conditions and equipment of the schools were not as perfect as those of full-time middle schools, why could they approach and surpass the academic performance of students in full-time middle schools? According to my understanding: in addition to living in practical production and having the knowledge of "applying what they have learned," the more important thing is that the teachers of agricultural middle schools have fully emphasized their subjective initiative, and the vast majority can work diligently with "humble learning, careful study, serious lesson preparation, and no gap between teachers and students." For example, I met a young female teacher, Zhang Fengyun, who had just graduated from junior high school during my inspection. When she was teaching bookkeeping to third-year junior high school students, one of the topics was how the commune records labor points. She had never learned it and didn't know how. How could she teach students? But she humbly asked the commune accountant for advice and learned it herself. However, after teaching it to the students, the students still didn't know how to keep accounts, so she personally went to the commune to record labor points. After practical experience, she guided them in a simple and easy way, and the students all knew how to record. This was the result of her daring to think, act, and work hard. There are many similar problems and solutions for this female teacher and many more agricultural middle school teachers. This shows that they rely on the leadership of the Party in their work and teaching, put politics in command, despise difficulties, and have strong perseverance. In addition, the county has divided guidance areas based on the distribution of schools, with full-time middle schools helping with lesson preparation and teaching, as well as various forms of helping agricultural middle school teachers improve the quality of teaching, which also has a certain relationship. Under the circumstances of insufficient teaching equipment and instruments, the full-time middle schools and agricultural middle schools give full play to the spirit of mutual borrowing, mutual support, and mutual exchange, which not only improves utilization but also saves expenses. This spirit of cooperation should be promoted.

	Agricultural Middle Schools Have Become Guidance Stations for Promoting Agricultural Science and Technology
	Agricultural middle schools have begun to continuously cultivate agricultural science and technology talents and have become guidance stations for promoting agricultural science and technology. For example, the Xiaozhaotun Agricultural Middle School adopted the method of using oiled paper for rice seedling cultivation, which was half a month earlier than usual, and the seedlings were strong; when the rice was infected with rice blast, the teachers and students developed "Ceresan" made of lime and small ash, which not only eliminated the disease but also achieved a bumper rice harvest (8,900 jin per mu), which was 2.4 times higher than the local average; the sorghum yield per mu of the Qiandangpu Agricultural Middle School was 20,000 jin, which was more than twice as high as the local high yield; the cotton yield per mu of the Caotun Agricultural Middle School was 5,200 jin, which was 4.2 times higher than the local average, ranking first in the province. Many schools also conduct soil analysis, various experiments, weather forecasts, plant diseases and insect pests, etc. They have investigated, experimented, compared, and researched everything related to agriculture. This shows that agricultural middle schools are truly facing the countryside and serving the countryside.

	Agricultural Middle Schools Have Saved a Lot of Expenses for the Country
	In terms of funding, agricultural middle schools have saved a lot of expenses for the country. Taking the 238 classes of agricultural middle schools in Xinmin County as an example, if each class of a full-time middle school costs 2,000 yuan, it would cost more than 476,000 yuan in 1959. However, the agricultural middle schools in Xinmin County not only did not use a penny of state money to run these 238 classes, but also earned more than 280,000 yuan in 1959, spent only more than 180,000 yuan, and saved more than 90,000 yuan, laying an economic foundation for the continued development of the school. This is truly in line with more, faster, better, and more economical results. Therefore, the peasants enthusiastically praised: "Agricultural middle school students are good at everything. They learn culture and do labor. They are really 'neng zhong' (capable)." (A middle school where everyone is capable).
	From this, it can be predicted that the intellectuals cultivated by agricultural middle schools will be new-type intellectuals who are both red and expert. This will play an active role in eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas, the differences between workers and peasants, and eliminating the differences between mental and physical labor.

	The fact that agricultural middle schools can take root in the countryside fully proves that the Party Central Committee's instructions on running agricultural middle schools are completely correct, timely, and fully in line with the needs of our country's socialist construction and the needs of the broad masses of working people. Such great achievements are a victory for the education policy, a victory for "walking on two legs," and ultimately, the flowering and fruiting of Mao Zedong Thought in the countryside.
	However, the development and consolidation of agricultural middle schools in Xinmin County has also gone through the struggle between two roads and two ideologies. When the new thing of agricultural middle schools appeared, it was criticized by some people with bourgeois educational views. They believed that the teachers were "leaks" from high school, the students were "leaks" from junior high school, and the schools were run by the masses, so they would definitely "not be able to run," "not be able to run well," and "not be able to run for long." However, the agricultural middle schools in Xinmin County, like agricultural middle schools all over the country, have powerfully refuted this incorrect and incomplete pessimistic mood and view with the facts of their healthy development. I think that the standard for measuring the quality of a school cannot simply be that the conditions for running the school must be good, looking at the students' cultural level and the school's teaching equipment, etc. It should be judged by whether it can cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture in a more, faster, better, and more economical way for the country in the spirit of the General Line.
	Now, generally speaking, the students in agricultural middle schools have some difficulty keeping up with the academic performance of students in full-time middle schools, but their productive labor knowledge is much richer than that of full-time middle schools. They can combine book knowledge with production knowledge. This is knowledge that combines theory with practice and can solve agricultural problems.
	Although agricultural middle schools have already shown their incomparable superiority and have achieved great results, we are continuous revolutionaries and must continue to work hard. We must run agricultural middle schools that meet the needs of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, that are directly related to the interests of the peasants, and that are enthusiastically supported by the masses of peasants even better, further serve agricultural production, serve the "four modernizations" of agriculture, and enable the agricultural development program to be realized earlier and better, thereby contributing to the continued Great Leap Forward of industry and agriculture.
	In short, the rapid and healthy development of agricultural middle schools is the result of the implementation of "walking on two legs" and vigorously carrying out mass movements in the education undertaking. With the great support and support of the masses, these mass agricultural middle schools have made due contributions to various production aspects related to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in the commune. Agricultural middle schools, which have developed rapidly and healthily, are in line with the education policies of "education serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor," "combining theory with practice," and "cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture," and are also in line with the spirit of the Party's General Line.
	Although the conditions of agricultural middle schools are poor at the current stage, they have a revolutionary spirit and soaring energy, and can make do with whatever is available, learning, teaching, and improving at the same time. They will inevitably continue to change with the rapid changes in our country's economic landscape. The development of agricultural middle schools in our province is still uneven and needs to be greatly improved. Universalizing agricultural middle schools in the vast rural areas and improving the cultural, scientific, and technological level of rural areas and the current advance of the vast rural areas toward the "four modernizations" of agriculture, in order to respond to Vice Premier Tan's call to the Congress to all peasants and people across the country to realize the agricultural program two or three years ahead of schedule, agricultural middle schools will undertake a certain role, so I think agricultural middle schools can be run on a large scale and with special attention.

	I believe that under the encouragement of this excellent situation, and under the continued guidance of Chairman Mao's educational thought, agricultural middle schools will definitely be run better, cultivate more agricultural technical talents who are both red and expert, and bear more abundant fruits for the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction. Finally, if my opinions are inappropriate, please correct me, delegates.

    农业中学前程远大
    农民热情地赞扬说：农中学生，样样都行，既学文化，又会劳动，真是能中。
    车向忱代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理向大会作的关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告；李先念副总理作的关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，还有谭震林副总理所作的为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告。对上述报告，愿意坚决贯彻执行。
    从这几个报告中，可以清楚看出，我国人民在党中央和毛主席英明正确领导下所取得的伟大的社会主义建设的成就，正在迅速改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，也为1960年的继续大跃进，打下了稳固基础。这给我们以力量和信心。
    辽宁省的教育工作在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，在省、市、县和人民公社各级党政的正确领导下，认真贯彻执行了党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”和“两条腿走路”的方针和党的八届八中全会“反右倾，鼓干劲”的精神。一年来，全省教育事业，在全面安排和整顿、巩固、提高的基础上，又有很大的发展和提高。目前，我们省大部分市有高等学校，县县有高中，社社有初中，队队有小学和幼儿园，业余学校更是星罗棋布，在全省范围内已基本形成了一个比较完整的教育体系。1958和1959两年教育事业的大发展，为今年的持续大发展打下了良好基础。
    农业中学是新生事物、是空前的创举
    在教育事业发展的新阶段，农业中学是一个新生的事物，是随着人民公社而来的，是空前的创举，也是历史发展的必然结果。它是总路线、大跃进的产物，所以，农民群众对农业中学是热烈拥护和大力支持的。
    现在把我在3月中旬视察我省新民县的农业中学情况谈谈：
    新民县的农业中学，是在沈阳市委和新民县委的直接领导下，由三、五所发展到现在的六十所学生达一万一千多名，平均每个公社七所，几乎每队都有农中、基本上普及了。学生可就地上学。学校都是半工半读，半日制的正规学校。他们都有固定的校舍、生产劳动基地、教学和生产设备，并在逐步充实，也建立了正常的教学和生产秩序，教育质量不断提高。学生已经有不同程度的掌握了旱田、水田、蔬菜等作物的种植和栽培，家畜、家禽的饲养，动植物的一般科学研究和管理，以及副业的编织等劳动技能。师生们正兢兢业业，满怀信心，在党的领导下，日益显示出农业中学的强大生命力和它的重要作用。
    办学的方向是为农业生产服务
    农中的办学方向是符合为农业生产服务的。从1959年秋，沈阳市委在新民县召开农业中学现场会议，决定农业中学必须进一步贯彻为农业“四化”培养大量技术人材以后，各校办学方向更加明确，道路更加宽阔。仅在今明两年，全县即可为农业战线输送七千多名农村急需的、具有初级和中级的农业科学技术人员。如该县茶棚庵农业中学，根据这一指示，在公社党委的支持下，就近与机耕队挂钩，开设了农业机械课，由机耕队的技术人员担任讲课。他们今年暑期毕业的三年级三十八名学生，现在都能驾驶和掌握拖拉机和各种农业机械，到毕业前可以完全达到在理论上理解，在操作上熟练，和一般的检修程度。又如小赵屯农业中学，学生看到社员用笨重的帘子脱谷，效率很低，不能按时完成任务，师生们就研究试制脱粒机，已经能掌握内燃机的学生积极参加，终于提前完成了任务。各地农中学生也都学会掌握一定的技术，并因地制宜的与当地菜园、农场、饲养场、水养及发电厂等挂钩，这些单位负担从技术理论到实地教学，学校负责组织学生按时按需要去给挂上钩的单位劳动。经过两年来的实践证明，效果很好，互相满意，对农业“四化”更起着推动作用。
      农业中学教师充分发挥了人的主观能动性
    全县在1958年就普及了初中，使90％以上的高小毕业生，升入初中。有了这样群众自己办的半日制中学，更好的满足了其子女继续升学的要求。该县的农业中学在校学生数比全日制普通中学生数量还多13％。通过学习和生产劳动的紧密结合，使农中学生们提高了社会主义和共产主义觉悟，树立了热爱农业生产劳动，热爱新农村的思想感情。更显著的是，由于贯彻了教学、生产劳动和科学研究三结合的原则，全县占60％的农业中学在语文、数学等主要学科成绩，已接近和赶上了一般全日制初中的成绩。在师资质量、业务水平都不高，学校的条件和设备均不如全日制中学那样完善的情况下，为什么能与全日制中学的学生成绩相接近和超过呢？依我的了解：农中学生除生活在生产实际中和具有“学以致用”的知识外，更重要的是农业中学教师们充分发挥了人的主观能动性，绝大多数能“虚心请教，细心钻研，认真备课，师生无间”地勤恳工作。比如我在视察中接见一位初中刚毕业的年轻女教师张凤云，当她给初中三年级学生讲簿记账时，其中有公社记劳动手册一题，她没学过也不会，怎能教学生呢？但她就虚心向公社会计请教，自己学会了。可是教给学生后，学生仍不会记账，她就亲自到公社记劳动手册，经过实际体验以后，就很简而易行地辅导，学生都会记了，这是由于她敢想敢做刻苦钻研的结果。她在一次由沈阳市委召开的半日制中学各年级教师参加的公开教学现场会上获得大家称赞。类似这样的问题和解决的办法，在这位女教师和更多的农中教师来说是很多的。这说明了他们在工作和教学中依靠党的领导，政治挂帅，藐视困难，有坚强的毅力。另外，教师们除通过函授和自修的学习，加速提高文化水平外，该县根据学校的分布情况，划分了辅导区，由全日制中学担负帮助备课和教学，以及各种形式地帮助农中教师提高教学质量，也是有一定关系的。在教学设备和仪器不足的情况下，全日制中学与农中之间，发挥互相借用、互相支援、互通有无的协作精神，这样既提高了利用率，也节省了开支，这种协作之风应加发扬。
        农业中学已成为推广农业科学技术的指导站
    农业中学已经开始不断地培养出农业科学技术人材，并已成为推广农业科学技术的指导站了。如小赵屯农业中学，根据农业“八字宪法”采用水稻育苗用油纸的办法，就比一般的提前半月，而且幼苗粗壮；水稻起稻瘟病时，师生研究出用石灰和小灰作成“赛力散”，不仅解除病害，还获得水稻大丰收（垧产八千九百斤），高于当地二点四倍；前当铺农中的高粱垧产二万斤，超过当地高产的一倍多；曹屯农中的棉花垧产五千二百斤，高于当地四点二倍，居全省第一。好多学校还搞土壤分析，各种试验，气象预报，植物的病虫害等，凡有关农业所需的都有调查、试验、比较和研究。这说明了农中真正面向农村，为农村服务。
    农业中学在经费方面为国家节省了很大开支
    在经费方面，为国家节省了很大开支。以新民县农业中学的二百三十八个班，按全日制中学每开一班以二千元计算，1959年就需四十七万六千多元，然而，新民县农中开办这二百三十八个班，不但没用国家一文钱，在1959年收入了二十八万多元，仅开支十八万多元，还节余九万多元，为学校的继续发展打下经济基础，这真是符合多快好省。所以他们今年除继续免收学生的学杂费和学校一切开支外，还计划作到供给60％的学生伙食费；也还有个别的学校要供给学生制服的。因此，农民们热情地赞扬说：“农中学生，样样都行，既学文化，又会劳动，真是能中。”（样样都能的中学）。
    由此可以预计，农业中学培养出的知识分子，将是又红又专的新型知识分子。这对于向着消灭城乡差别，工农差别，消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别，都将起积极促进作用。
  农业中学之所以能在农村扎下根来，就充分证明了党中央关于创办农业中学的指示是完全正确的、适时的，也是完全符合我国社会主义建设的需要和广大劳动人民群众的需要。这样伟大的成就是教育方针的胜利，是“两条腿走路”的胜利，归根结底是毛泽东思想在农村开花结果。
    但是，新民县的农业中学在发展和巩固过程中，也是经过两条道路和两种思想的斗争的。当农业中学这个新生事物一出现的时候，就遇到一些抱有资产阶级教育观点的人的非议，他们认为教师是高中漏，学生是初中漏，又由群众办学，一定“办不了”，“办不好”，“办不长”的。但是，新民县的农业中学同全国各地农中一样，以它健康发展的事实有力地驳倒了这种不正确、不全面的悲观情绪和看法。我认为：衡量一个学校的好坏、高低的标准，不能单纯的认为办学都必须条件好，看学生的文化程度和学校的教学设备等；应当从它是否能以总路线精神为国家多快好省地培养出有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者。
    现在农中学生，一般的说，书本知识还有些赶不上全日制中学的学生成绩，但他们的生产劳动知识都要比全日制中学丰富得多。他们能把书本知识和生产知识结合起来。这是理论与实际结合的知识，能解决农业问题的。
    农业中学虽然已经显示出了它的无比优越性，也取得了很大成绩，但我们是不断革命论者，还要继续努力。把符合总路线、大跃进、人民公社所需要的、与农民利益直接相关并为农民大众所热诚拥护的农业中学办得更好，进一步地为农业生产服务，为农业“四化”服务，使农业发展纲要更早更好的实现，从而为促进工农业的继续大跃进作出贡献。
    总之，农业中学的迅速健康发展，是教育事业上贯彻执行“两条腿走路”，大搞群众运动的结果。这样群众性的农业中学，在群众的极大支持扶植下，学校又为公社的农林牧副渔各项有关生产作出了应有的贡献。这样迅速健康发展起来的农业中学是符合“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”，“理论与实践相结合”，“培养有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者”的教育方针的，也是符合党的总路线精神的。
    农业中学在目前阶段条件虽差，但是它有革命精神、冲天干劲，能因陋就简，边学、边教、边提高，并且还必将随着我国的经济面貌快速改变而随之不断改变的。农业中学在我省发展得还不平衡，需要大力提高，在广大农村中普及农中，提高农村文化科学技术水平和目前广大农村向农业“四化”进军，以便响应谭副总理向大会号召全体农民和全国人民为提前两年或三年实现农业纲要，农业中学将承担着一定的作用，从而我想农中可以大办而特办。
    我相信在这大好形势的鼓舞下，在毛主席的教育思想继续指导下，农业中学一定会办得更好，培养出更多又红又专的农业技术人材，为社会主义建设大跃进之花，结出更丰硕的果实。最后，我的意见有不当之处，请代表指正。
