Industrialists and Businessmen Should Transform Their Thinking Through Practice
Representatives Liu Guojun and Zhang Jingli Discuss Their Experiences Visiting Wuxi and Changzhou

Chairman, fellow delegates:

We fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the National Final Accounts for 1959 and the Draft National Budget for 1960" and "Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," as well as Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report "Striving to Achieve the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule." We will resolutely implement them.

The reports of the three vice premiers have given us great education and encouragement, and have further clarified our understanding of the current situation of socialist revolution and construction, and the bright prospects for continued great leaps forward in the future. The great practice of two consecutive years of great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959 fully embodies the correctness of the Party and Chairman Mao's leadership, and fully embodies the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune have become invincible weapons for the people of the whole country to carry out socialist revolution and construction. Now, a nationwide mass movement for technological innovation and technological revolution, centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation, is being carried out with great momentum throughout the country. The people of the whole country are working selflessly to achieve continued leaps forward in 1960. We believe that with the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and the soaring enthusiasm of the 650 million people, the task of the 1960 National Economic Plan will surely be fulfilled and overfulfilled, and the continued leap forward of the national economy will surely be realized! As industrialists and businessmen, in the face of this excellent situation, we must resolutely invest all our strength in the torrent of the Great Leap Forward under the leadership of the Party. Through serving socialism, we must strengthen self-education and self-transformation.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out in his report: "The great practice of 1958 and 1959 has given us rich experience. This experience tells us that under the socialist system, it is possible to develop the national economy at the speed of the Great Leap Forward, and it is an objective necessity. The national economy always goes through a process of development from imbalance to balance and then to imbalance, and each iteration raises the level of production a step further, and the national economy continues to move forward in such a wave-like movement." This valuable experience has given us great inspiration. Last month, we went to Wuxi and Changzhou to visit. Now we realize that the process of Comrade Wang Zhengquan of Changzhou Dacheng No. 1 Factory reforming the loom process design is in line with the law pointed out by Vice Premier Li. Comrade Wang Zhengquan dared to think and act. In order to improve cotton cloth production, he boldly reformed the loom process design, increasing the loom speed from the original 190 revolutions to more than 240 revolutions, and the highest reaching 300 revolutions. This creative reform has significantly improved the output and quality of cotton cloth. The consumption of electricity and machinery materials has also been significantly reduced. The cost has also been reduced accordingly. If it is promoted throughout the textile industry, according to this year's output estimate, the cost can be reduced by more than 100 million yuan per year. This innovation broke through the outdated technical theory and brought the textile industry into a new stage. In the process of reform, the workers and masses of the factory and Comrade Wang Zhengquan gradually accelerated the speed of the car, so that the contradictions were fully exposed, and then grasped the contradictions and solved the contradictions, so that the backward departments caught up with the advanced departments, achieved a common leap forward, and made production advance in waves.

Our acceptance of socialist transformation as industrialists and businessmen is also a process of repeated progress. In the ten years since liberation, we have experienced countless iterations. Thanks to the leadership and education of the Party, we have taken a step forward in the iterations. In the past two years, industrialists and businessmen have participated in labor practice and work practice. Through labor practice, under the direct education of the Party and the help of worker comrades, we have made progress. However, compared with our employee comrades, we feel that we are far from adequate in terms of our enthusiasm in labor, our feelings for socialism, and our living habits. There is obviously a considerable distance between us and them. In these aspects, we must take a positive attitude, face up to our shortcomings, and further cultivate socialist feelings in labor practice, change bourgeois living habits, and completely change our political stance. Only in this way can we make more achievements for the cause of socialism, and can we gradually transform ourselves and catch up with the current rapidly developing situation. This time we went to Wuxi and Changzhou to visit, we had a common feeling that the working class has such soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, working selflessly and forgetting to eat and sleep in the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, you chase me and I chase you, pushing the movement to a climax. Compared with myself, I feel greatly inadequate. Especially since our country is currently in a new historical period of continuing in-depth socialist revolution and a great leap forward in socialist construction, in order to adapt to the development of the situation, we industrialists and businessmen must completely abandon the bourgeois stand and world outlook, establish the proletarian stand and world outlook, and cultivate the proletarian ideology and feelings. Therefore, we must wholeheartedly accept the leadership of the Party in labor practice, learn from the working class with an open mind, actively serve socialism, and transform ourselves in the service. We must also work hard to strengthen political study, study Mao Zedong Thought, and arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, so that we can gradually change our stand and world outlook and make more contributions to the cause of socialism.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun instructed us in his report that the key to increasing light industrial production still lies in expanding the source of raw materials. In addition to improving product quality and increasing variety, we should try our best to save raw materials, materials and increase the rate of finished products. The textile industry is an important aspect of light industry. We would like to make some suggestions in this regard.

Jiangsu Province is one of the older textile industrial bases in our country, and has a certain foundation in technical strength. We suggest that the textile industry in Jiangsu Province can gradually develop in the direction of high, precision, and advanced technology; at the same time, in terms of saving raw cotton, the number of cotton yarn counts can be appropriately increased, so that more yarn and more cloth can be spun and woven to meet the growing needs of the people.

Regarding the raw material problem of the textile industry. We suggest that under the premise of carrying out a large-scale pig raising movement, the rabbit raising business can be appropriately developed. Rabbit hair is a raw material for high-grade wool fabrics. In addition to offsetting the supply of wool, the production of rabbit hair can also be used for export needs; at the same time, rabbit meat can also increase the supply of some non-staple foods. The development of the rabbit raising business has the following advantages for rural sideline occupations.

First, the labor required for rabbit raising is not strong. The old, weak, women and children in rural areas with poor physical strength can take on the task. As long as a small number of technical guidance personnel are equipped (such as personnel who can prevent and treat rabbit diseases and are familiar with the living habits of rabbits), they can be raised. Rabbit feed is mainly composed of green feed, supplemented by concentrated feed, which is relatively easy to solve in rural areas.

Second, rabbits have strong reproduction rates, grow fast, and can be pulled for hair in a short period of time. High-quality rabbits can be raised to about one catty per year per head. The price of rabbit hair is much higher than that of wool, and rabbit meat can also be sold as non-staple food, which is good for increasing the income of agricultural and sideline industries and improving farmers' lives.

Third, rabbit urine and feces are very good fertilizers. Its fertilizer efficiency is high and it has the ability to kill insects. Therefore, raising rabbits can not only increase income, but also open up fertilizer sources for agricultural production, and can also be used as raw materials for pesticides, which is of great help to agricultural production. According to the person in charge of the rabbit farm of the Red Flag People's Commune in Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province, the price obtained from selling rabbit urine and feces covers the cost of rabbit feed and there is still a surplus.

The above opinions are not mature enough. For reference by relevant departments only.

Finally, I wish

The delegates good health!

The great success of the conference!

    工商业者要通过实践改造思想
    刘国钧、张敬礼代表谈在无锡、常州参观的体会主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”和“全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”，以及谭震林副总理“为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗”的报告。并坚决贯彻执行。
    三位副总理的报告，给予我们很大的教育和鼓舞，使我们进一步明确认识当前社会主义革命和建设的形势，和今后持续大跃进的美好前景。经过1958年和1959年两年连续大跃进的伟大实践，充分地体现出党和毛主席领导的英明正确，充分地体现出社会主义制度的无比的优越性。总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三大法宝，已经成为全国人民进行社会主义革命和建设的无往不胜的武器。现在全国各地，正声势浩大地开展全民性的以机械化和半机械化、自动化和半自动化为中心内容的技术革新和技术革命运动。全国人民正为实现1960年继续跃进而忘我劳动。我们相信，有党和毛主席的领导，有毛泽东思想的指导，有六亿五千万人民的冲天干劲，1960年国民经济计划的任务一定能够完成和超额完成，一定会实现国民经济的继续跃进！作为一个工商业者在这大好的形势面前，一定要坚决地在党的领导下，投入大跃进的洪流中去，贡献一切力量。通过为社会主义服务，加强自我教育和自我改造。
    李富春副总理在报告中指出：“1958年和1959年的伟大实践，使我们取得了丰富的经验。这些经验告诉我们：在社会主义制度下，用大跃进的速度发展国民经济，是完成可能的，是客观的必然性。国民经济总是经历不平衡到平衡再到不平衡的发展过程，而每一次反复，也就把生产水平提高一步，国民经济就在这样的波浪式的运动中不断地向前发展。”这条宝贵的经验，给我们很大的启发。上月我们曾经到无锡、常州去参观。现在体会到常州市大成一厂王正铨同志改革布机工艺设计的过程，就符合李副总理所指出的规律。王正铨同志敢想敢为，他为了要提高棉布生产，大胆地改革了布机工艺设计，使布机的车速由原来的一百九十转提高到二百四十转以上，高的达到三百转。这一创造性的改革，使棉布的产量和质量都有显著的提高。电力和机物料的消耗也有显著的降低。成本也相应地降低，如在整个纺织业中加以推广，按照今年的产量估计，每年可以降低成本一亿多元。这一革新冲破了陈旧的技术理论，使纺织工业进入了一个新的阶段。在改革的过程中，该厂的工人群众和王正铨同志把车速逐步加快，使矛盾尽量暴露，然后抓住矛盾、解决矛盾，使落后部门赶上先进部门，取得共同的跃进，使生产一浪推一浪的前进。
    我们工商业者接受社会主义改造，也同样是一个反复前进的过程。解放十年来，不知经历了多少次的反复，由于党的领导和教育，使我们在反复中前进了一步。近两年来，工商业者参加了劳动实践和工作实践。通过劳动实践，在党的直接教育和工人同志的帮助下，我们取得了进步。但是，我们和职工同志相比之下，在劳动中的干劲，对社会主义的感情以及生活习惯等方面，就感到很不够。我们和他们显然存在着不小的距离。在这些方面，我们必须以积极的态度，正视自己的缺点，进一步在劳动实践中，培养社会主义感情，改变资产阶级的生活习惯，彻底改变政治立场。这样才能为社会主义事业作出更多的成绩，自己才能逐步得到改造，赶上当前飞跃发展的形势。我们这次到无锡、常州去参观，有一个共同的体会，工人阶级那样的冲天革命干劲，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，废寝忘食地忘我劳动，你追我赶，把运动推向高潮，与自己相形之下，感到自己大大的不够。特别是目前我国正处在社会主义革命继续深入和社会主义建设大跃进的新的历史时期，为了适应形势的发展，我们工商业者就必须彻底抛弃资产阶级立场和世界观，树立无产阶级立场和世界观，培养无产阶级的思想感情。因而，我们必须在劳动实践中，一心一意接受党的领导，虚心向工人阶级学习，积极为社会主义服务，并且在服务中改造自己。我们还必须努力加强政治学习，学习毛泽东思想，以毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，这样才能逐步的改变自己的立场和世界观，为社会主义事业作出更多的贡献。
    李富春副总理在报告中指示我们，轻工业增产的关键，仍然在于扩大原料的来源。除了提高产品质量、增加花色品种以外，应当千方百计地节约原料、材料和提高出品率。纺织工业是轻工业的一个重要方面。我们想就这方面，提一些建议。
    江苏省是我国较老的纺织工业基地之一，在技术力量上有一定的基础。我们建议，江苏省的纺织工业可以逐步向高、精、尖的方向发展；同时，在节约原棉方面，可以适当的提高棉纱支数，这样可以多纺纱、多织布，来满足人民日益增长的需要。
    关于纺织工业的原料问题。我们建议，在开展大规模养猪运动的前提下，可以适当地发展养兔事业。兔毛是高级毛织品原料。生产兔毛，除了可以抵补羊毛的供应外，还可以供出口的需要；同时，兔肉也可以增加一部分副食品的供应。养兔事业的发展，对农村副业有以下几点好处。
    一、养兔所需要的劳动力不强。农村中体力较差的老、弱、妇孺都可以担任。只要配备少数的技术指导人员（如能防治兔子的疾病和熟悉兔子的生活习性的人员），就可以饲养。兔的饲料，主要是以青饲料为主，精饲料为辅，在农村中比较容易解决。
    二、兔的繁殖率强，生长快，饲养很短的时期，就可以拉毛。良种兔，每年每头可以提高到一斤左右。兔毛的价格比羊毛高得很多，兔肉亦可以出售作为副食品，这对增加农副业的收入，改善农民生活有好处。
    三、兔的尿、粪是很好的肥料。它的肥效较高，并且有杀虫能力。所以养兔不但可以增加收益，还可以为农业生产增辟肥源，并且可以作为农药的原料，这对农业增产也有很大的帮助。据江苏省靖江县红旗人民公社养兔场负责人介绍，出售兔的尿粪所得的代价，抵付养兔的饲料，还有多余。
    以上意见，是不够成熟的。仅供有关部门参考。
    最后敬祝
    代表们身体健康！
    大会胜利成功！
