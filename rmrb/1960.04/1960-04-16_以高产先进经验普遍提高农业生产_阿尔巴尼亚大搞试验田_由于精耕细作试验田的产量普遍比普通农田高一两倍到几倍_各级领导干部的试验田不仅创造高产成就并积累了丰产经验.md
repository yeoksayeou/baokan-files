Xinhua News Agency, Tirana Telegram: Albania is vigorously developing experimental plots throughout the country in order to universally improve agricultural production using advanced high-yield experiences.

According to statistics from the Lushnjë and Fier districts alone, Party and government cadres at all levels and state farms and agricultural cooperatives have established over 2,200 hectares of experimental plots, with over 300 cadres participating in cultivating these plots. The Korçë District Committee of the Albanian Labor Party even held a special symposium to promote experimental plots, summarizing the pilot work of the 1959 experimental plots and studying this year's plan.

In many areas, experimental plots have expanded from one or two hectares last year to more than ten hectares. Some areas have also developed production targets and detailed farming logs for intensive cultivation. This year, Lushnjë is preparing to sow a total of more than 480 hectares of experimental cotton fields, planning to harvest an average of 20 quintals of cotton per hectare, which is more than double the yield of ordinary cotton fields.

Last spring, Albanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Shehu, Minister of Agriculture Çomo, and regional Party secretaries and chairmen of the People's Assembly Executive Committees personally planted experimental plots. Subsequently, many state farms and agricultural cooperatives also opened up experimental plots, sowing various crops such as corn, cotton, sugar beets, and tobacco. Deep plowing, close planting, and intensive cultivation were implemented on all experimental plots, with large amounts of organic and chemical fertilizers applied. Some experimental plots were deep plowed to a depth of 60-70 centimeters, with 400-600 quintals of organic fertilizer applied per hectare. Thanks to these scientific measures and meticulous management, every experimental plot achieved a bumper harvest, with yields one to two times or even several times higher than ordinary farmland. For example, the fodder corn experimental plot of the "November 8th" State Farm in Sukës yielded over 1,500 quintals per hectare.

The experimental plots of Party and government leaders at all levels not only created high-yield achievements, but also accumulated high-yield experiences. Hysen, a member of the Fier District Committee of the Labor Party, planted nearly one hectare of experimental cotton field. He deep plowed to a depth of 45 centimeters, applied 350 quintals of organic fertilizer and a large amount of chemical fertilizer, and cultivated twice. As a result, the harvest amounted to 38 quintals per hectare, more than double the yield of ordinary cotton fields, and 70% of the cotton was of first-class quality. The yield of a cotton experimental plot jointly cultivated by Beg Isufi, the Party Secretary of the Vlorë District Committee, and agronomist Gani Hoxha was even higher, reaching 50.4 quintals per hectare. He deep plowed three times, with depths ranging from 20 to 35 centimeters, applied 400 quintals of organic fertilizer, and carried out field management such as cultivation and timely irrigation. Nuchi Tina, a colonel in the Albanian People's Army, created a high-yield achievement of 1,100 quintals of fodder corn per hectare on an experimental plot of one hectare through close planting, deep plowing, and careful cultivation.

    由于精耕细作试验田的产量普遍比普通农田高一两倍到几倍  各级领导干部的试验田不仅创造高产成就并积累了丰产经验
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚全国各地正在大搞试验田，以高产的先进经验来普遍提高农业生产。
    仅据卢什涅和费里两个区的统计，各级党政干部和国营农场、农业合作社的试验田已有二千二百多公顷，参加种试验田的干部已有三百多人。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党科尔察区委员会为了推广试验田还专门召开座谈会，总结1959年试验田的试点工作和研究今年的计划。
    不少地区试验田已从去年一、二公顷扩大到十几公顷，有的地区还制订了生产指标和精耕细作的农事日志。今年，卢什尼已准备播种棉花的试验田共有四百八十多公顷，计划每公顷平均收获棉花二十公担，这就比一般的棉田要多收一倍多的棉花。
    去年春天，阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡、农业部部长乔莫和各地区党委书记、人民会议执委会主席等亲自种了试验田。接着，不少国营农场和农业合作社也开辟试验田，播种了玉米、棉花、甜菜、烟草等各种农作物。在所有的试验田上都实施了深耕密植和精耕细作，并大量施加有机肥料和化学肥料。有的试验田深耕达六十—七十公分，每一公顷地施有机肥四百到六百公担。由于这些科学的措施和精心管理，每一块试验田都获得了丰收，产量比普通农田高出了一、二倍以至几倍，例如苏克斯“十一月八日”国营农场的饲料玉米试验田每公顷收一千五百多公担。
    各级党政领导干部们的试验田不仅创造了高产成就，并且积累了高产的经验。劳动党费里区委会委员希森种了近一公顷的棉花试验田，他深耕了四十五公分，施加了三百五十公担有机肥和大量的化肥，并且中耕了两次，结果收获量合每公顷三十八公担，比一般的棉田要多收两倍，70％的棉花都是头等质量。发罗那区党委书记贝格·伊苏菲和农艺师加尼·霍查合种的一块棉花试验田一公顷的产量更高达五十点四公担，他曾深耕了三次，深度从二十公分到三十五公分，施加有机肥四百公担，并且进行了中耕和及时灌溉等田间管理工作。阿尔巴尼亚人民军上校努契·提纳在一公顷的试验田上由于密植和深耕细作创造了一公顷收一千一百公担饲料玉米的高产成绩。
