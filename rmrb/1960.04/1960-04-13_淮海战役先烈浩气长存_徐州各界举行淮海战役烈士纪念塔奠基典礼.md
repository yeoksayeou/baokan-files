Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 12th—More than 20,000 people from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xuzhou and all circles of Xuzhou City solemnly held the groundbreaking ceremony for the Huaihai Campaign Martyrs Memorial Tower on the foothills of Phoenix Mountain in the southern suburbs of Xuzhou City on the morning of April 5.

Representatives from the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan also attended the groundbreaking ceremony.

The Huaihai Campaign was a famous battle both at home and abroad during the Liberation War. This campaign lasted sixty-five days, from November 7, 1948, to January 10, 1949. The People's Liberation Army won a great victory in this campaign, annihilating more than 550,000 enemy troops. The victory of the Huaihai Campaign, coupled with the victories of the Liaoshen and Pingjin Campaigns, exhausted the Kuomintang reactionary government's main capital for fighting the civil war, laying a solid foundation for the People's Liberation Army to cross the Yangtze River and quickly liberate the entire mainland. The Central Plains and East China Field Armies, local armed forces under the Central Plains, East China, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan regions, and the people of the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu who supported the front participated in the Huaihai Campaign. They were brave and tenacious in battle, demonstrating noble qualities of infinite loyalty to the cause of the people's revolution, and established immortal feats for the cause of the liberation of the motherland. In April 1959, the State Council instructed the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan to jointly build the Huaihai Campaign Martyrs Memorial Tower and the Huaihai Campaign Memorial Hall in Xuzhou City, so that the people could forever admire and pay tribute to the heroic images of the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed in the Huaihai Campaign, and that the lofty spirit of the revolutionary martyrs, loyal to the people's revolutionary cause, could become a force to inspire the people to move forward.

The memorial tower and the memorial hall will both be built at the foot of the scenic Phoenix Mountain in Xuzhou City. After the memorial tower is completed, it will be thirty-eight meters high. The lower part of the tower will have a huge relief depicting the heroic images of the People's Liberation Army and the civilian laborers supporting the front during the Huaihai Campaign. The entire structure is solemn, simple, and magnificent. The entire project is expected to be completed in one year.

At the groundbreaking ceremony, Wei Yongyi, Vice Governor of Jiangsu Province, spoke on behalf of the Huaihai Campaign Martyrs Memorial Tower Construction Committee. After elaborating on the great significance of the Huaihai Campaign, he called on the people of Jiangsu to learn from the lofty revolutionary spirit of the martyrs, unite as one, and strive to defend and build the motherland. Wang Zhong, Vice Governor of Anhui Province, Qin Cheng, Commissioner of the Xuzhou Prefecture, General Liang Renjie, representative of the People's Liberation Army, and Zhong Lin, Chairman of the Xuzhou Women's Federation, also spoke at the meeting. Finally, Wei Yongyi, Vice Governor of Jiangsu Province, Wang Zhong, Vice Governor of Anhui Province, Yang Hanlin and General Liang Renjie, representatives of the People's Liberation Army, members of the tower construction committee, and representatives of Shandong and Henan provinces broke ground with shovels to lay the foundation for the Huaihai Campaign Martyrs Memorial Tower.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 12th—The Huaihai Campaign Nianzhuang Battle Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Monument, built by the people of Pixian County, Jiangsu Province, to commemorate the heroic martyrs who sacrificed in the Nianzhuang battle of the Huaihai Campaign, was inaugurated in Nianzhuang on the 5th. Representatives of the Xuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Xuzhou Prefecture Commissioner's Office, and the Pixian County Committee of the Communist Party of China all spoke at the inauguration ceremony.

In the center of the memorial碑 are the four gilded characters "浩气长存" ("The Spirit of Righteousness Will Endure Forever") personally inscribed by Chairman Liu Shaoqi. On both sides of the monument are inscriptions by Marshal Liu Bocheng and Marshal Chen Yi. The base of the monument is surrounded by sculptures depicting the heroic images of People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters charging into battle and the broad masses of people supporting the front.

Nianzhuang was the main battlefield in the first stage of the Huaihai Campaign. In this stage, our army completely encircled and annihilated the Kuomintang Huang Baitao Corps here, and Huang Baitao, commander of the enemy corps, was also killed.

    纪念塔和纪念馆都将建立在风景秀丽的徐州市凤凰山东麓。纪念塔建成后，塔身高三十八米，塔的下部有表现淮海战役中人民解放军和支援前线的民工的英勇形象的巨幅浮雕，整个结构庄严朴素，气势雄伟。全部工程预计一年完成。
    在奠基典礼上，江苏省副省长韦永义代表淮海战役烈士纪念塔筹建委员会讲话。他在阐述了淮海战役的伟大意义后，号召江苏人民学习烈士崇高的革命精神，团结一致，为保卫和建设祖国而奋斗。安徽省副省长王中、徐州专署专员秦诚、解放军代表梁仁芥将军、徐州市妇联主席仲麟等也在会上讲了话。最后，江苏省副省长韦永义，安徽省副省长王中，人民解放军代表杨汉林、梁仁芥将军，建塔委员会的委员和山东、河南两省的代表等执锨破土，为淮海战役烈士纪念塔奠基。
    新华社南京12日电　江苏省邳县人民为纪念淮海战役碾庄战斗中英勇牺牲的烈士建立的淮海战役碾庄战斗革命烈士纪念碑，5日在碾庄举行了落成典礼。中共徐州地委、徐州专署和中共邳县县委的代表，都在落成典礼上讲了话。
    纪念碑的正中是刘少奇主席亲笔所题“浩气长存”四个溜金大字，碑的两面是刘伯承元帅和陈毅元帅的题字，碑基的四周雕有人民解放军指战员冲锋陷阵和广大人民支援前线的英雄形象。
    碾庄是淮海战役第一阶段的主要战场。在这一阶段中，我军将国民党黄伯韬兵团全部包围并歼灭在这里，敌兵团司令黄伯韬也被击毙。（附图片）淮海战役烈士纪念塔模型　　　　　　　　徐　枫摄（新华社稿）
