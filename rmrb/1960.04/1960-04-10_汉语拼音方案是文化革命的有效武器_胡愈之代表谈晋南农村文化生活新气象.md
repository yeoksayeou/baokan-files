The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is an Effective Weapon for the Cultural Revolution
Representative Hu Yuzhi Discusses the New Look of Rural Cultural Life in Southern Shanxi

Fellow Representatives:

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the Draft National Budget for 1960," and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's "Striving to Achieve the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule" report.

A month ago, I and some cultural and educational workers from the capital went to the Jinan Special District of Shanxi Province to visit the People's Communes. We visited four counties and one city, and saw more than a dozen communes and management areas. The new socialist countryside after communization is truly vibrant and full of vitality, which makes everyone feel very excited. The new people and new things seen there cannot be finished in a few days. Now, let's talk about the cultural life in rural Southern Shanxi and the achievements of Wanrong County in eradicating illiteracy and promoting Mandarin using the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme.

The Cultural Revolution is Moving Forward Like a Rushing Horse

The farmers of Southern Shanxi are singing about the new countryside after communization like this:

    The benefits of the commune are endless,
    The sound of machines echoes in the sky,
    Industry and agriculture develop together,
    The cultural landscape has greatly changed.
    As soon as the rooster crows three times,
    Every household sweeps the streets and courtyards,
    Smooth and clean as if washed with water,
    Flowers are red and willows are green like a park.
    Mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows are wiped out,
    Poems and paintings fill the walls on the streets.
    After work and a meal,
    People are crowded in front of the blackboard newspaper,
    New people, new things, new experiences,
    National affairs are fully reported.
    There is free time at noon,
    People enter the library;
    Male and female commune members,
    Borrowing and returning books.
    Energetic and refreshed during rest,
    Exercising on the sports field,
    Playing ball and practicing boxing,
    Running, jumping, and having fun.
    After work, in the evening,
    People come and go in the village,
    Streetlights are shining,
    Everyone is holding a new flashlight.
    Going south, a string of people,
    The storytelling team comes to promote;
    Going north, a string of people,
    The projector is turned on;
    Going east, a string of people,
    Taking a turn in the club;
    Going west, a string of people,
    The amateur troupe performs a play.
    The bell rings and the activities are over,
    Men, women, old and young study books.
    The hat of illiteracy is removed early,
    The phonetic alphabet is also fully learned,
    Inventions and creations write poems,
    Everything can be done.
    With culture to engage in production,
    The three agricultural modernizations are in sight.
    Everyone is happy and relaxed,
    Endless songs of happiness.

This is a ballad poem written by Wang Tingqing, a peasant poet from Wudui Village, Jishan County. It truly reflects the new look of cultural life in rural Southern Shanxi, without any exaggeration. Not only in Jishan County, but everywhere in the rural areas of Southern Shanxi that we visited, it is the same. What we saw was: "Every wall has poems and paintings, everywhere there is singing, everyone reads newspapers, and everyone strives for advancement." In the People's Communes of Wanrong County, we saw several collective performances by residents. Old men and women in their sixties and seventies could sing and dance. A few months ago, they were illiterate, but now they can write poems for guests and speak poetry. It is hard to believe this if you don't see it with your own eyes.

As Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report: "According to the requirements of the rapid development of productive forces, continuous reform of the relations of production and the superstructure opens up broad avenues for the continuous development of productive forces. And the continuous development of productive forces, in turn, forces the relations of production and the superstructure to undergo continuous reform." After communization, the productive forces in rural areas have been developing rapidly and leap forward, which forces the broad masses of farmers to demand culture and science and technology, and to launch a high tide of cultural revolution and technical revolution. The cultural revolution and technical revolution have greatly promoted the further development of productive forces. In the new countryside of Southern Shanxi, the cultural revolution is advancing like a rushing horse. Farmers are no longer worried about hunger and cold, and now their most urgent need is spiritual food, to read and write, to study Mao Zedong Thought and to study science and technology.

In Wanrong County, we saw young, middle-aged, and old people carrying a white cloth backpack printed with the four red characters "Cultural Revolution" in farmers' homes, in public canteens, and in the fields. Inside were several books, newspapers, notebooks, and pens. They called it "One Bag and Four Treasures," which they never left their side. They read during work breaks, after meals, and even in bed before going to sleep. In Qinggu Village, Wanrong, farmers who graduated from literacy classes read an average of seventy or eighty booklets a month, and some read one hundred and sixty or seventy. One old man, Li Taibo, read seventy-five books in ten days after becoming literate, and he is a peasant poet.

Why are farmers so eager to read? Because reading broadens their horizons and greatly improves their political awareness. Also, because reading enriches their production knowledge and plays a positive role in production. A farmer in Wanrong County was inspired by reading the phonetic reading material "Heini Planting Cotton" and planted experimental fields of cotton and sweet potatoes, which yielded a bumper harvest. Some people read "How to Eliminate Cotton Aphids" and "How to Eliminate Red Spiders" and treated seeds with "Celisan," and as a result, the cotton fields did not have insects. Some people read the phonetic reading material "Model Stockbreeder," and those who were not at ease with pig farming not only solved ideological problems but also studied pig farming methods, and were eventually named pig farming models and pacesetters twice and once respectively. After farmers became literate, their spiritual outlook changed greatly, and even family disputes such as disharmony between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law and quarrels between husbands and wives disappeared.

Using the Phonetic Alphabet to Eradicate Illiteracy is a Fast, Good, and Economical Method

Why were farmers in Southern Shanxi able to remove the hat of illiteracy, universally read and write, and greatly improve their cultural level in a very short period of time? This is of course due to the leadership of the Party Committee, putting politics in command, and launching a mass movement, carrying out literacy campaigns and spare-time education. Also, due to the development of productive forces after communization, farmers are eager to learn culture. In Wanrong County, in particular, the Party Committee Secretary took the lead in using the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet to help eradicate illiteracy, learn culture, and promote Mandarin, which greatly improved the cultural level of farmers in a short period of time. The experience of Wanrong fully proves that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, approved and promulgated by the National People's Congress two years ago, is an effective weapon for the Cultural Revolution.

The great achievements and advanced experiences of Wanrong County in using the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme for literacy, spare-time education, and general education have already been comprehensively introduced in the speech of Representative Li Hui, and I will not repeat them here. I just want to say that using the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet to help eradicate illiteracy and learn Chinese is indeed a fast, good, and economical method. From the perspective of teaching methods, it can be said to be a real revolution. With this method, we are fully confident that we can greatly accelerate the realization of Article 31 of the National Agricultural Development Program, and permanently eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people throughout the country, without the phenomenon of relapse.

Farmers in Wanrong County once reflected on the "three difficulties" of using Chinese characters alone to eradicate illiteracy and the "four advantages" of phonetic notation. The "three difficulties" of using Chinese characters alone to eradicate illiteracy are: (1) slow speed; (2) easy to relapse; (3) inconvenient to learn. The "four advantages" of phonetic literacy are: (1) fast speed and high quality; (2) eradicating relapse and expanding literacy achievements; (3) suitable for adult characteristics, learning and using; (4) easy to learn Mandarin. Therefore, after becoming literate, they composed quick rhythms to thank the Party and Chairman Mao. Some said: "Chairman Mao leads the study of culture, phonetic literacy is a good method"; some said: "The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet is great, it removed my hat of illiteracy; happiness does not forget the Communist Party, thank you benefactor Mao Zedong."

The experience of Sunji Village in Wanrong County proves that using the phonetic alphabet can not only accelerate literacy, but more importantly, it can greatly shorten the time for Chinese language teaching in spare-time schools and general schools, thereby shortening the years of study. It now appears that using the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet as a tool for Chinese language teaching, it is possible to shorten the years of spare-time primary education from about two years to about one year, and to shorten the current six-year primary school years to four years. This will be another major revolution in China's education.

The Experience of Wanrong Has Attracted Attention from All Over the Country

Because the use of the phonetic alphabet to recognize characters, learn politics, learn culture, and learn science and technology has a huge promoting effect on the current cultural revolution, especially on cultural and educational work in rural areas, the experience of Wanrong has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life across the country. The phonetic literacy movement was first fully promoted in the Jinan Special District of Shanxi Province. Approximately one-third of the residents, or more than one million young and middle-aged farmers, have invested in the study of the phonetic alphabet. The Shanxi Provincial People's Committee issued instructions on February 11, requesting the rapid development of the phonetic literacy movement throughout the province. Shandong Province recently convened a provincial on-site meeting on phonetic literacy in Pingyuan County, and decided to fully launch the movement in the province in June this year. At present, 3.18 million people in Shandong Province have learned the phonetic alphabet. Other provinces such as Jilin, Anhui, Sichuan, Hebei, and Zhejiang are also carrying out the phonetic literacy movement of learning from Wanrong and catching up with Wanrong. From the experience of various places, phonetic literacy is an effective way to accelerate the intellectualization of workers and peasants and promote teaching revolution. I suggest that cultural and educational workers across the country vigorously promote and work together, first in the Mandarin-speaking areas of the country, universally teach the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet, vigorously carry out the phonetic literacy movement, and gradually extend it to other areas, to rapidly improve the cultural level of workers and peasants to meet the current rapid development of the technical revolution and cultural revolution in our country, to meet the urgent requirements of building socialism in a fast, good, and economical manner in our country. In his report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out that all departments, including education and culture, must regard supporting agriculture as their important task. In his report, Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin also pointed out that the early realization of the agricultural development program is not only a matter for hundreds of millions of farmers, but also that departments such as science, education, and culture should better support agricultural production and construction. From the perspective of supporting agriculture, vigorously promoting the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet and phonetic literacy in the vast rural areas has greater political significance.

    汉语拼音方案是文化革命的有效武器
    胡愈之代表谈晋南农村文化生活新气象各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”、李先念副总理“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”和谭震林副总理“为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗”的报告。
    一个月前，我和首都一部分文教工作者一同到山西省晋南专区去参观人民公社。我们走了四县一市，看了十几个公社和管理区。公社化以后的社会主义新农村真是生气勃勃，气象万千，使我们每个人的心情都非常激动。在那里看到的新人新事是说几天也说不完的。现在单就晋南农村文化生活和万荣县用汉语拼音方案扫盲和推广普通话的成就来说一说。文化革命的声势如万马奔腾
    晋南农民对于公社化以后的新农村是这样歌唱着的：
    公社好处说不完，
    机器声音响连天，
    工业农业齐发展，
    文化面貌大改变。
    公鸡三叫刚天亮，
    家家户户扫街院，
    光滑明净如水洗，
    花红柳绿似公园。
    蚊蝇鼠雀消灭净，街头诗画满墙连。
    做罢活来吃罢饭，黑板报前人站满，
    新人新事新经验，国家大事登的全。
    中午有个闲时间，人们进了图书馆；
      男社员、女社员，借的借来还的还。
    休息时候精神爽，体育场上来锻炼，
    又打球来又耍拳，跑跑跳跳闹的欢。
    下了工，到晚间，村中来往人不断，
    大街小巷灯光闪，都是拿的新手电。
    往南走，一溜串，说唱队伍来宣传；
    往北走，一溜串，幻灯机子开了演；
    往东走，一溜串，俱乐部里转一转；
    往西走，一溜串，业余剧团把戏演。
    钟声一响活动完，男女老少把书念。
    文盲帽子早摘掉，拼音字母也学全，
    发明创造写诗篇，样样事情都能干。
    有了文化搞生产，农业三化在眼前。
    人人欢乐心舒畅，幸福歌儿唱不完。
    这是稷山县坞堆村农民诗人王廷卿写的快板诗。这里如实地反映了晋南农村文化生活的新面貌，没有半点夸张。不仅在稷山县，在我们所到过的晋南农村，到处都一样。我们看到的是：“墙墙有诗画，处处闻歌声，人人读书报，个个争先进”。在万荣县的人民公社，我们看到几次的居民集体表演，六七十岁的老大爷、老大娘都能唱歌跳舞，几个月以前还是一字不识的文盲，现在都能对客挥毫，出口成诗。这种情况，要不是亲眼看到，是很难相信的。
    正如李富春副总理报告中所说：“根据生产力迅速发展的要求，对生产关系和上层建筑进行不断的改革，就为生产力的不断发展开辟了广阔的道路。而生产力的不断发展，又迫使生产关系和上层建筑不能不进行不断的改革”。在公社化以后，农村的生产力不断地飞跃地发展，这就迫使广大的农民群众要求文化和科学技术，掀起文化革命和技术革命的高潮，而文化革命、技术革命又大大促进了生产力的更进一步的发展。在晋南新农村里，文化革命正在以万马奔腾的声势向前迈进。农民已经再不耽心忍饥受冻了，现在他们最迫切要求的是精神食粮，是读书识字，学习毛泽东思想和学习科学技术。
    在万荣县，我们在农民家中，在公共食堂，在地头，看到了青年、壮年、老年身上都背着一个印着“文化革命”四个红字的白布背包，里面装着几本书、报纸、笔记本和笔，他们叫作“一包四宝”，这是随身不离的，在工作休息的时间读书，在饭后读书，在睡觉的时候还在床上读书。在万荣的青谷村，扫盲毕业以后的农民，一个月平均读七八十本小册子，个别的有读一百六七十册的。有一位李泰柏老汉，在扫盲以后十天中就读了七十五册书，他是农民诗人。
    农民为什么这样热烈地爱读书，因为读了书使他们扩大了眼界，大大提高了政治觉悟，也因为读了书，丰富了生产知识，对生产起积极作用。万荣县有一个农民因为读了注音读物“黑妮种棉”，受到启发，种上棉花和红薯的试验田，得到了丰产；有人读了“怎样消灭棉蚜”和“怎样消灭红蜘蛛”，用“赛力散”拌种，结果棉田就不生虫；有人读了注音读物“模范饲养员”，原来不安心养猪工作的，不但解决了思想问题，还钻研养猪方法，最后两次被评为养猪模范和一次标兵。农民普遍识字以后，精神面貌大大改变，连婆媳不和、夫妻吵架等等家庭纠纷都没有了。
    用拼音字母扫盲是个多快好省的办法
    晋南农民为什么能够在很短的时间摘掉文盲帽子，普遍地读书识字，大大提高了文化水平？这固然是由于党委领导、政治挂帅、大搞群众运动，大搞扫盲和业余教育的结果，也是由于公社化以后，生产力发展，农民迫切要求学习文化。而在万荣县，特别显著的是党委书记带头，运用汉语拼音字母来帮助扫盲、学习文化和推广普通话，才在短时间内大大提高农民的文化水平。万荣的经验充分证明，两年前全国人民代表大会批准公布的汉语拼音方案是文化革命的一种有效的武器。
    万荣县用汉语拼音方案进行扫盲、业余教育和普通教育所取得的巨大成绩和先进经验，在李辉代表的发言里，已经有了比较全面的介绍，我不想再在这里重复。我只想说一说，用汉语拼音字母来帮助扫盲和学习语文，确实是一种多、快、好、省的办法。从教学方法来讲，可以说是真正的革命。有了这种办法，我们完全有把握，可以大大加速农业发展纲要三十一条的实现，在全国范围内百分之百地永远扫除青壮年中的文盲，而不致再有回生复盲的现象。
    万荣县的农民曾经反映单用汉字扫盲的“三苦恼”和注音的“四好”。单用汉字扫盲的“三苦恼”是：（一）速度慢；（二）容易回生；（三）不便学习。注音扫盲的“四好”是：（一）速度快，质量高；（二）根绝回生复盲，扩大扫盲成果；（三）适合成人特点，学了就能用上；（四）容易学习普通话。因此他们脱盲后纷纷编了快板感谢党和毛主席。有的说：“毛主席领导学文化，注音扫盲好办法”；有的说：“汉语拼音呱呱叫，摘掉我的文盲帽；幸福不忘共产党，感谢恩人毛泽东。”
    万荣县孙吉村的经验证明，运用拼音字母，不仅可以加速扫盲，更重要的可以在业余学校和普通学校大大缩短语文教学的时间，因而缩短学习的年限。现在看来，用汉语拼音字母作为工具，进行语文教学，有可能把业余初等教育的年限，从两年左右缩短到一年左右，把现行六年制的小学年限缩短到四年。这将是我国教育事业的又一大革命。
    万荣的经验已经引起全国各地的重视
    正因为运用拼音字母来识字、学政治、学文化、学科学技术，对于当前的文化革命，特别是对于农村的文化教育工作，有巨大的促进作用，所以万荣的经验，已经引起全国各方面人士的注目。注音识字运动，首先在山西省晋南专区全面推广，整个专区，大约三分之一的居民，即一百多万青壮年农民投入拼音字母的学习。山西省人民委员会已于2月11日发出指示，要求在全省迅速开展注音识字运动。山东省最近在平原县召开了全省注音识字现场会议，决定在今年6月全省全面开展。目前山东全省已有三百一十八万人学习拼音字母。其他吉林、安徽、四川、河北、浙江等省也在开展学万荣、赶万荣的注音识字运动。从各地的经验看来，注音识字是加速工农群众知识化，促进教学革命的一种有效办法。我建议全国各地文教工作者大力宣传，共同努力，首先在全国普通话地区，普遍教学汉语拼音字母，大力开展注音识字运动，并逐步推广到其他地区，高速度地提高工农群众的文化水平，以适应我国目前正在急速开展的技术革命、文化革命的迫切需要，以适应我国多快好省建设社会主义的迫切要求。李富春副总理在报告中，指出教育、文化等各个部门，都要把支援农业当做自己的重要任务。谭震林副总理报告中也指出，提前实现农业发展纲要，不仅是几亿农民的事情，科学、教育、文化等各部门，都应当更好地支援农业生产和建设。从支援农业这一任务来说，在广大农村中大力推广汉语拼音字母和注音识字，更有重大的政治意义。
