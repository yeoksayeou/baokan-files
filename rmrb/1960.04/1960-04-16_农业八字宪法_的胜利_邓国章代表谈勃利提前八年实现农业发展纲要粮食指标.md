The Victory of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture"
Representative Deng Guozhang Speaks on Boli Achieving the Grain Target of the National Agricultural Development Program Eight Years Ahead of Schedule

Presidium, Fellow Representatives:

I fully endorse the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian; I fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and will actively implement it in future work.

Now, I will only discuss the issue of the struggle between two ideologies, two methods, and two paths in our Boli County's agricultural production in 1959.

In 1959, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune banners, the agricultural production of our Boli County, Heilongjiang Province, fully unleashed the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, comprehensively implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and achieved a comprehensive Great Leap Forward and a bumper harvest on the foundation of the 1958 Great Leap Forward. In 1959, despite suffering from severe natural disasters, our county's total grain output still reached more than 180,000 tons, exceeding the exceptionally bountiful year of 1958 by 8.4%, more than doubling the 1949 output, with an average grain yield of 415 jin per mu, achieving the grain target of the National Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule. Many large-scale high-yield records also emerged. Our Qiangkeng Management Area's total grain output in 1959 increased by more than 30% compared to 1958; many high-yield records emerged for millet, sorghum, and corn. The entire management area sold more than 1.4 million jin of grain to the state, with an average of 1,500 jin sold to the state per person.

The main reasons for achieving such a great harvest in 1959 were: our county conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong on developing agricultural production, strengthened the Party's leadership under the direct leadership of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee and the Hejiang Prefectural Party Committee, adhered to putting politics in command, opposed right-leaning tendencies, boosted morale, and continuously carried out the struggle between two ideologies, two methods, and two paths. It was also the result of fully leveraging the superiority of the People's Commune system and comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture."

Raising Production Targets, Expanding Fertilization Area

In Boli County's agricultural production in 1959, the struggle between two ideologies, two methods, and two paths was very intense. At the beginning of spring plowing, there appeared the right-leaning idea that "the 1958 Leap Forward went too far, the potential is not great, there is a shortage of labor and livestock, and another Leap Forward cannot be done." When formulating the agricultural production plan for 1959, there was talk of "reducing the area, lowering the targets, and reducing measures." After discovering this right-leaning idea, we summarized the achievements of the 1958 Great Leap Forward and presented the favorable conditions for achieving a continued Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1959. These were: after the 1958 Great Leap Forward and the realization of the People's Communes, the socialist consciousness of the commune members was further enhanced, and their enthusiasm was even greater; the People's Communes were further consolidated and improved after implementing three-level management and rectification; due to the 1958 agricultural bumper harvest and the implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," the material and technical conditions this year were better than in any previous year; cadres and the masses had also accumulated experience. We also summarized the experience of cadre experimental fields and large-area high-yield production in 1958, which proved that agricultural production still had great potential. These facts were used to refute right-leaning ideas, boost the morale of the masses, and usher in a new Leap Forward. The county's sown area increased from the original 900,000 mu to 1,037,265 mu, thereby triggering a high tide of spring plowing and production, with fertilization completed on 91% of the total cultivated area.

Full Seedlings, Strong Seedlings, Rational Close Planting

At the beginning of spring plowing, another debate arose about "how to plant the land." Some people advocated comprehensively promoting rational close planting on the basis of land preparation and fertilization; others advocated sparse planting on large areas and close planting on small areas for experimentation. In particular, a small number of well-to-do middle peasants spread the idea among the masses that close planting could not produce more grain, saying, "Corn planted too densely will not produce cobs, sorghum and millet planted too densely will not produce ears, and soybeans planted too densely will suffocate the flowers and not produce pods"; and saying, "Close planting is okay on small plots, but large areas are too labor-intensive, and narrowing the ridges and increasing the rows will damage the roots," etc. These ideas fully reflected the struggle between advanced scientific thinking and backward conservative thinking in agricultural production. In order to solve these ideological problems, we first summarized the experience of increased production through close planting of rice, sorghum, millet, corn, and other crops in 1958. The county party committee established two close planting experimental rooms (warm cellars) and conducted experiments on various crops at different densities. After the crops in the experimental rooms grew, cadres and commune members were organized to visit in cycles, and based on the experience of the experimental fields and experimental rooms, farmers, cadres, and technicians were organized to carry out a large-scale debate focusing on whether close planting could produce more grain. The right-leaning idea that rational close planting could not produce more grain was criticized, and the understanding of cadres and the masses was unified, ensuring the implementation and execution of rational close planting, and spring plowing and sowing reached the requirements of close planting. However, the conservative thinking of wide ridges and sparse planting, which had been adhered to for many years, could not be solved through a single ideological struggle or debate. After the seedlings emerged from the soil, those who opposed close planting saw that the seedlings were denser than in any previous year and said, "Loving the seedlings when they are small will lead to begging with a gourd when they grow up," "Planting so much land at such a high density will inevitably be abandoned," advocating cutting off some of the densely planted seedlings through seedling thinning. Upon discovering this idea, immediate measures were taken, and the entire county was divided into three areas to organize inspection teams to inspect the seedling work in accordance with the requirements of close planting. We adopted the method of inspecting, visiting, and debating simultaneously. Nearly 10,000 people in the county visited and compared the experimental fields of cadres at all levels. Through on-site debates, the understanding of close planting was enhanced, the technical plan for close planting was thoroughly implemented, and the seedling thinning technical personnel were trained. Fourteen thousand nine hundred mu of land were replanted throughout the county, ensuring rational close planting. Subsequently, the entire county launched a seedling care campaign centered on "full seedlings, good seedlings, uniform seedlings, and strong seedlings." In 1959, the actual number of plants for various crops in the county was, on average, more than 2,100 corn plants per mu, 5,000 sorghum plants per mu, more than 16,600 soybean plants per mu, 400,000 rice plants per mu, more than 400,000 wheat plants per mu, and about 53,300 millet plants per mu. In general, the number of plants for each crop increased by 20% to 30% compared to 1958, implementing rational close planting and achieving a comprehensive bumper harvest of various crops.

Launch a High-Yield Movement, Strengthen Field Management

During the summer hoeing period, due to the strengthening of political and ideological work and the launch of summer hoeing competitions, weeding was completed by the end of July, and the focus shifted to late-stage field management. At this time, some cadres and commune members showed blind optimism, believing that the crops had full seedlings, were growing robustly, and that a bumper harvest was guaranteed, making further processing unnecessary. Cadres and commune members in some disaster-stricken areas believed that everything was over, that reduced production was inevitable, and that processing would not help. Well-to-do middle peasants and a small number of cadres influenced by well-to-do middle peasant thinking relaxed late-stage field management, saying, "Releasing the autumn ridges to collect large weeds is not as good as engaging in sideline production," advocating drawing labor and livestock out to engage in sideline production that "makes money quickly and generates more income," and not actively releasing the autumn ridges to collect large weeds. At this time, the cadres of the Yuanye Brigade of the Xingfu Commune and the Zhen'an Management Area of the Bolizhen Commune led the commune members to launch a high-yield movement. Their approach was promoted throughout the county, and their experience was summarized. Taking advantage of the situation, a district- and team-level high-yield movement was launched in the rural areas of the entire county.

Due to the strengthening of the Party's political and ideological leadership, a large-scale bumper harvest in agricultural production was guaranteed. The county party committee also proposed the requirements of completing the harvest in ten days, sending the grain by November 15, and finishing the threshing by the end of November. A small number of people with right-leaning ideas said that this requirement was "not realistic," saying, "The crops in 1959 are good, the plants are tall, the ears are large, there are many plants, it is labor-intensive, there is little labor, and the requirements are too fast to be completed." In response to these ideas, education was strengthened, and this right-leaning thinking was criticized. At the same time, work teams were organized to go deep into the Xiaowuzhan and Jixing two key communes to help the communes research and reform tools, greatly improving efficiency. On-site meetings were held to exchange and promote local experience, accelerating the progress of autumn harvest, threshing, and grain delivery. Based on the principles of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" and walking on two legs, each commune organized 2,891 people to engage in tool reform, creating 107 wooden large and small motorized corn threshers, 30 hand-cranked corn threshers, 60 motorized large weed cutters, 21 versatile motorized threshers, 41 motorized winnowing machines, and 73 motorized rice threshers. 70% of the county's crops were threshed by machine, accelerating the progress of autumn harvest and grain delivery, and the task of purchasing 96,500 tons of grain was completed in sixteen days. The threshing was completed by the end of November, ending the autumn harvest one and a half months earlier than in the past.

On the basis of the achievements made in 1959, extremely favorable conditions were created for achieving a sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward and a bumper harvest in 1960. Now, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole county have launched a lively and bustling high tide of spring plowing production competition. They are working hard to achieve a sustained Great Leap Forward this year!

    “农业八字宪法”的胜利
    邓国章代表谈勃利提前八年实现农业发展纲要粮食指标主席团、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春、李先念副总理所做的报告；我完全同意全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，并在今后工作中积极贯彻执行。
    现在，我仅就我们勃利县在1959年农业生产中两种思想、两种方法、两条道路斗争的问题，作如下发言。
    1959年，我们黑龙江省勃利县的农业生产，在党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社旗帜的光辉照耀下，充分发挥广大人民群众的积极性和创造性，全面贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，在1958年大跃进的基础上，获得了全面的大跃进、大丰收。1959年我们县在遭受了严重的自然灾害的情况下，粮食总产量仍达到十八万多吨，比特大丰收的1958年还多8.4％，超过1949年二倍多，粮食平均每亩产量达到四百一十五斤，提前八年实现了农业发展纲要的粮食指标。并出现不少大面的高额丰产纪录。我们抢垦管理区，1959年的粮食总产量比1958年增产了30％多；谷子、高粱、苞米都出现了不少高产纪录，全管理区售给国家一百四十多万斤粮食，平均每个人卖给国家一千五百多斤。
    1959年，所以能够获得这样大丰收，主要是：我们县认真贯彻了党和毛泽东同志关于发展农业生产的指示，在中共黑龙江省委和合江地委的直接领导下，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，反右倾，鼓干劲，不断进行两种思想、两种方法、两条道路斗争的结果，也是充分发挥人民公社制度的优越性和全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”的结果。
    提高增产指标，扩大施肥面积
    勃利县在1959年农业生产中，两种思想两种方法两条道路的斗争，是很激烈的。在春耕开始就出现了：“1958年跃进跃到分了，潜力不大，劳畜力少，再跃进干不了。”1959年不能继续大跃进的右倾思想。在制定1959年农业生产计划时，“缩小面积，降低指标，减少措施”。发现这种右倾思想后，通过总结1958年大跃进成就，摆出1959年实现农业生产继续大跃进的有利条件。这就是：经过1958年大跃进和实现人民公社化，社员群众的社会主义觉悟进一步提高了，干劲更足了；贯彻三级管理和经过整顿之后，人民公社进一步巩固和提高了，由于1958年的农业大丰收和贯彻农业“八字宪法”的结果，今年的物资条件和技术条件比过去任何一年都好；干部和群众也都积累了经验。并总结了1958年干部试验田和大面积丰产经验，证明了农业生产还有很大潜力。用这些事实批驳了右倾思想，鼓起了群众的干劲，出现了新的跃进。全县播种面积由原来九十万亩增播到一百零三万七千二百六十五亩，从而掀起了备耕生产高潮，施肥完成了占总耕地面积91％。
    苗全、苗壮，合理密植
    在春耕开始又出现了“地怎么种”的争论，一部分人主张在整地、施肥的基础上全面的推行合理密植；另一部分人主张大面积稀植，小面积密植进行试验。特别是少数富裕中农在群众中散布密植不能多打粮，说：“苞米密了不结棒，高粱、谷子密了不出穗，大豆密了捂花子不结角”；并说：“小块密植行，大面积费工不行，缩垅增行会伤根”等思想。这些思想充分反映了农业生产上先进的科学思想与落后的保守思想的斗争。为了解决这些思想问题，我们首先总结1958年水稻、高粱、谷子、苞米等作物的密植增产经验。县委搞了两个密植试验室（暖窖），对各种作物进行了不同密度的试验。在试验室作物长起来后，组织干部和社员进行了循环参观，并根据试验田和试验室的经验，组织农民、干部、技术员开展了以密植能不能多打粮为中心的大鸣大放大辩论。批判了认为合理密植不能多打粮的右倾思想，统一了干部和群众的认识，保证了合理密植的贯彻和执行，春耕播种达到了密植的要求。但是多少年来宽垅稀植，因循守旧的保守思想，不是通过一次思想斗争或辩论就可以解决的。在禾苗出土后，反对密植的人看到禾苗比任何一年都密，说什么“从小爱苗，长大抱瓢”，“种这么多地，密度这样大，非撂不可”，主张通过定苗把密植的苗砍掉一部分。发现这种思想，立即采取了措施，全县分三片组织了检查团，按密植要求对全苗工作进行了检查。采取边检查，边参观、边辩论，全县有将近一万人到各级干部的试验田参观对比。通过就地辩论，提高对密植的认识，彻底贯彻了密植技术方案，培训了间苗技术手，全县补种了十四万一千九百亩地，保证了合理密植，接着全县开展了以“苗全、苗好、苗匀、苗壮”为中心的爱苗运动。1959年全县各项作物实际株数，苞米平均每亩二千一百多株，高粱平均每亩五千株，大豆平均每亩一万六千六百多株，水稻平均每亩四十万株，小麦平均每亩四十万株以上，谷子平均每亩五万三千三百株左右。各项作物一般都比1958年增加株数20％到30％，贯彻了合理密植，获得了各项作物的全面大丰收。
    开展丰产运动，加强田间管理
    夏锄期间由于加强了政治思想工作，开展了夏锄竞赛，到7月下旬即结束铲趟，转入后期田间管理。这时在部分干部和社员中出现了盲目乐观情绪，认为庄稼苗全，长的粗壮、丰收有把握，用不着再加工了。部分受害地区干部和社员认为一切都完了，减产已定，加工也不顶事。富裕中农和受富裕中农思想影响的少数干部，放松了后期田间管理，说：“放秋垅拿大草不如把副业搞”，主张把劳畜力抽出去搞“来钱快、收入多”的副业生产，不积极地放秋垅拿大草。这时杏树公社原野和勃利镇公社镇安管理区干部领导社员开展了丰产运动。全县推广了他们的作法，总结了他们的经验。因势利导，在全县农村中开展了区、队丰产运动。
    由于加强了党的政治思想领导，保证农业生产的大丰收。县委又提出十天割完地，11月15日送完粮，11月末打完场的要求，少数有右倾思想的人，说这一要求“不切合实际”，说“1959年庄稼好，棵高穗大，株数多，费工大，劳力少，要求的快，完不了”。针对这些思想，加强教育，批判了这种右倾思想。同时组织工作组深入小五站和吉兴两个重点公社，帮助公社研究改革工具，大大地提高了效率。召开现场会议交流和推广各地经验，加速秋收和脱谷送粮进度。各公社本着“土洋结合”和两条腿走路方针，组织了二千八百九十一人大搞工具改革，创造了木制大小型动力苞米脱粒机一百零七台，手摇苞米脱粒机三十台，动力大型拦草机六十台，万能动力脱谷机二十一台，动力扬场机四十一台，水稻动力脱谷机七十三台。全县70％的庄稼用机器脱谷，加快了秋收送粮的进度，十六天完成了九万六千五百吨的征购粮任务。11月末打完了场，比过去提前一个半月结束了秋收。
    在1959年取得成绩的基础上，为1960年实现持续的全面的大跃进大丰收，创造了极有利的条件。现在全县人民，在党的领导下，已经掀起了热火朝天的春耕生产竞赛高潮。正在为实现今年持续大跃进而努力！
