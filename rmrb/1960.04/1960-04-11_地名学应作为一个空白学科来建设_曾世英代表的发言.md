Comrade Zeng Shiying's Speech

I completely agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft.

Under the correct leadership of the Party, all aspects of socialist construction are leaping forward, and the science of surveying and mapping is no exception. Now, from a corner of surveying and mapping science, I will talk about my superficial understanding of how large-scale collaboration promotes scientific development.

What I want to talk about is the work of toponymic transliteration. Toponymic transliteration, simply put, is the phonetic transcription of non-Chinese place names using common writing. This is an indispensable part of surveying and mapping work. Like other content on maps, it has profound political ideology and scientific accuracy and systematicity. For example, the world's highest peak, Mount Everest, its name appeared in Chinese classics more than two hundred years ago, but the insidious imperialists shamelessly altered it to "Mount Everest." In the past, the Chinese people did not notice this and blindly followed, which was wrong. For example, before liberation, Urumqi was called "Dihua," which was an insult to ethnic minorities by the reactionary rulers of the past. Whether there are reactionary and insulting names in the place names of ethnic minority languages still needs further study. In terms of toponymic translation technology, due to historical reasons, confusion and errors are even more obvious. For example, the village of Shushenskoye, where Lenin was exiled in 1897, was reported by the "People's Daily" to have eleven translations in ten books. According to incomplete statistics, in surveying and mapping work, there are nineteen Chinese transliterations of the Mongolian word for "river." Recently, a comrade from Qinghai wrote: "The sign of the Golmud Transportation Station is written as 噶尔穆 (Ga'ermu), the small sign is written as 格尔木 (Ge'ermu), and the road sign and department store name are written as ?尔穆." If this confusion continues, it will not only increase the difficulty for readers, but also reduce the scientific value of the map.

After the birth of the Chinese phonetic alphabet, we have another scientific tool to help transliterate place names. Premier Zhou said: "The Chinese phonetic alphabet... can be used to transliterate foreign personal and place names and scientific and technical terms, and can be used to transliterate Chinese personal and place names in foreign documents, newspapers, and periodicals..." However, how to use it appropriately so that the place names spelled with Chinese phonetic alphabet are not only suitable for scientific requirements, but also convenient for the general public to use, and further become an international language of geography, is a scientific issue worthy of in-depth study and vigorous promotion.

Surveying and mapping workers have the responsibility to solve these problems. First of all, because maps are needed everywhere in socialist economic construction and cultural and educational construction, the place names on the maps must be accurate and reliable, and the place names inevitably include non-Chinese place names; large-scale mapping work is being carried out in ethnic minority areas, which requires accurate translation of place names in ethnic minority languages into Chinese; and international affairs are reported frequently today, the place names on maps and the place names in newspapers need to be unified. Furthermore, experience tells us that as long as a place name appears once on a map, it will have an impact on society, and it will be quite difficult to change it again. Therefore, the standardization of toponymic transliteration should not lag behind the production of maps, but should be ahead. The Party saw this point early on, so the State Science and Technology Commission proposed the topic of toponymic transliteration when formulating the twelve-year scientific perspective plan. The Map Publishing House, under the leadership of the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping, undertook the research and organization tasks. Although the Map Publishing House has done a lot of work in map compilation and publishing under the correct leadership and care of the Party, for example, the number of teaching maps issued from 1955 to 1959 alone exceeded 230 million copies, achieving one copy per primary and secondary school student, which has never happened in Chinese history. However, the subjective strength of this project assigned by the State Science and Technology Commission is not adapted to the objective requirements. Not only is the theoretical level of the cadres not adapted to the requirements of correctly reflecting the country's foreign policy, ethnic policy, and cultural and educational policy, but also the professional knowledge is insufficient, especially the lack of basic training in linguistics, and they are illiterate in many foreign languages and ethnic minority languages. The Party tells us that as long as we put politics in command, rely on leadership, and rely on collaboration, any difficulty can be overcome. The Party also put forward the policy of learning while doing and learning well while doing. The comrades who work are full of confidence and work hard.

In exploring working methods and directions, the first thing we came into contact with was the division between transliteration and literal translation, that is, which place names or which parts of place names should be transliterated and which should be translated literally. Views on this issue vary.

The second is the issue of standard pronunciation. When transliterating foreign place names, the standard pronunciation of Chinese needs to be resolved, which has been resolved under the premise of vigorously promoting Mandarin. However, when transliterating place names in ethnic minority languages, there is still the issue of the standard pronunciation of ethnic minority languages. The reason why the Mongolian word for "river" mentioned above has nineteen different translations is not only due to the influence of the dialect of the translators, but also the variation of the Mongolian dialect itself. This is a very delicate and complex social problem, and also a special linguistic research problem, which does not seem to be solved in the short term.

The third is the issue of accurate transliteration and pronunciation of translated names. According to the commonly used Chinese character pinyin table, there are only more than 400 Chinese Mandarin syllables. It is difficult to be competent to transliterate diverse non-Chinese pronunciations with such few and rigid syllables. For example, the Erlian Railway Station on the Jier Railway, the pronunciation of the two characters "Erlian" is very different from the Mongolian pronunciation, and the Mongolian comrades cannot understand it. Also, the syllables of compound consonants in non-Chinese languages, after being translated into Chinese characters, often become two or three syllables, resulting in lengthy and awkward translated names, which are difficult to pronounce and remember. It is often heard that primary and secondary school students say that geography class is very interesting, but the place names are not easy to pronounce and remember. How to solve this problem also needs to be studied.

The fourth is the issue of the correct use of the Chinese phonetic alphabet. Chinese characters can only represent syllables, and Chinese phonetic alphabet can also represent phonemes, which is a major contribution to writing tools. It is much more accurate and convenient to transliterate with phonemes than with syllables. However, there is still disagreement in society on whether to transliterate non-Chinese place names directly from the original text using Chinese phonetic alphabet, or indirectly annotate each character according to the Chinese translation.

The fifth is how to utilize the whole people. More than a dozen ethnic minorities have now created new Latin-style ethnic minority writing schemes based on the Chinese phonetic alphabet. Because the usage and pronunciation of the same letters are basically the same in the new writing systems of various ethnic minorities, it is not difficult to imagine that if the Chinese phonetic alphabet is used properly, the place name spelling will not only give play to the commonality between each other, but also retain the particularity of each other. Then, under the principle of walking on two legs, while transliterating with Chinese characters, the place names spelled with Chinese phonetic alphabet will surely become a form that all ethnic groups in the country are happy to use together. With a map of place names spelled with Chinese phonetic alphabet, all ethnic groups in the country can use it. This is not only of far-reaching significance in national unity, but also very beneficial to map production.

Finally, there is the far-reaching ideal of how to promote writing reform. Premier Zhou pointed out: "Writing is always changing... The writing forms of various nations in the world will gradually unify one day." The writing systems of more than 60 countries in the world are Latin-style. There are two ways to transliterate place names in these countries, namely "sound-alike" and "shape-alike." "Sound-alike" is easy to hear, and "shape-alike" is easy to read, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. When transliterating with Chinese characters, only "sound-alike" can be used, but not "shape-alike." After the birth of the Chinese phonetic alphabet, the situation has changed. When transliterating with Chinese phonetic alphabet, both "sound-alike" and "shape-alike" can be used. Latin-style place names have relatively wide circulation internationally. Therefore, under the principle of naming according to the owner, if the combination of "sound-alike" and "shape-alike" is creatively done well, then a large number of internationally common vocabularies can be provided through place names, creating conditions for the gradual unification of world writing. This idea is also worth studying.

The above-mentioned problems or ideas involve a wide range of aspects and are not easy to solve under normal circumstances. Through large-scale collaboration, we have now formulated several preliminary plans. First of all, as an organizational measure to ensure the completion of this huge task, the Toponymic Transliteration Committee was organized under the attention of the Party. Although the scientific research and production departments themselves have heavy tasks, they have all assigned leading comrades or experts to participate in the committee. Through the hard work of the committee members, after holding five group meetings and three plenary meetings in five months, four drafts of the toponymic translation principles were drafted and published in four journals. After publication, it received attention from society, further obtained constructive opinions, and launched academic debates, which further improved the draft.

In order to investigate the written forms of ethnic minority languages of place names, so as to scientifically check and sort out toponymic transliteration, the administrative departments, scientific research units, and universities in the autonomous region or province have mobilized a large number of cadres and teachers and students of the geography or history and geography departments to provide information or go to the counties to conduct investigations. Now, the toponymic data of the ethnic minority areas needed on the large map sets has been collected or is being collected in the form of Chinese characters and ethnic minority characters. From these materials, not only is the chaotic situation of toponymic transliteration further reflected, but also the traditional errors on the current maps are corrected from a positive perspective, so that the quality of the maps has been improved.

In order to formulate toponymic transliteration standards, many experts from the central and local writing reform, ethnic minority language research, translation, and publishing units have been appointed to help us conduct research and drafting work. After repeated and enthusiastic discussions, one type each of Chinese-Mongolian, Chinese-Uyghur, and Chinese-Tibetan place name guidelines (drafts) have been drafted and are beginning to be tested in the map production process.

Although the above work is only a beginning, it has never been done so thoroughly in the history of Chinese cartography. This promotes the development of science and must be attributed to the Party. As Vice Premier Li Xiannian mentioned in his report, it is the result of the nationwide spirit of leaving difficulties to oneself and giving convenience to others under the education of the Party, the prevailing atmosphere of collaboration, bringing treasures to the door, and the situation of helping others for pleasure.

Chairman Mao told us: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear". Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements and must move forward further. The task of toponymy is to study the origin and meaning of place names and their semantic meaning. In the Soviet Union, it has branched out from geography and linguistics and become an independent discipline. In this regard, we are still a blank spot until now. In order to actively develop this currently blank discipline and catch up with the international level, our surveying and mapping workers earnestly hope to quickly build up toponymy as a blank discipline.

Through the establishment of toponymy, the quality of toponymic transliteration will inevitably be greatly improved. Not only will the scientific accuracy and systematicity change the historical face, but there will also be qualitative changes in political ideology. But these changes also depend on accurate original data, that is, place names written in the respective ethnic minority languages according to orthography. It is hoped that ethnic minority comrades and comrades who are familiar with the geography or language of ethnic minority areas will provide more information and put forward valuable suggestions for improvement, and set off a mass upsurge of collaboration to work together to do a good job in the Party's surveying and mapping work.

    地名学应作为一个空白学科来建设
    曾世英代表的发言
    我完全同意并拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。
    在党的正确领导下，社会主义建设事业的各个方面在大跃进，测量制图科学也不例外。现在我从测量制图科学这一方面的一个角落里，来谈谈关于大协作促进了科学发展的一点粗浅体会。
    我要谈的是地名译音工作。地名译音，简单地说，就是用通用的文字来音译非汉语的地名。这是测量制图工作中不可缺少的组成部分。它和地图上的其他内容一样，有深刻的政治思想及科学的准确性和系统性。例如，世界上最高的珠穆朗玛峰，她的名称在二百余年以前早就见于汉文的典籍，但别有用心的帝国主义者竟无耻地窜改为“埃佛勒斯峰”，以往国人不察，盲从使用，这是错误的。又如解放以前，乌鲁木齐市称“迪化”，这是过去反动统治者对少数民族的侮辱。在少数民族语言的地名中，是否也有反动侮辱性的命名，还有进一步研究的必要。在地名翻译技术上，由于历史上的原因，混乱和错误的现象，更是明显存在的。例如，1897年列宁被流放的舒申村，“人民日报”曾经报道，在十本书中有十一种译法。又据不完全统计，在测绘工作中，蒙语“河”字的汉字译音有十九种写法。最近有一位同志从青海来信说：“噶尔穆运输站的大牌子写噶尔穆，小牌子写格尔木，路牌及百货公司名写?尔穆。”这种混乱现象如果继续存在，不仅增加了读者的困难，而且降低了地图的科学价值。
    在汉语拼音方案诞生以后，我们多了一种帮助音译地名的科学工具。周总理说：“汉语拼音方案……可以用来音译外国的人名地名和科学技术术语，可以在对外的文件、书报中音译中国的人名地名……”。但是如何适当运用，使汉语拼音字母拼写的地名，既适合科学要求，又便于广大人民使用，并进一步成为地理学上的国际语言，这是一个值得深入研究和努力推动的科学课题。
    测绘工作者有解决这些课题的责任。首先，因为社会主义经济建设和文教建设中到处需要地图，地图上的地名必须准确可靠，而地名中短不了非汉语的地名；少数民族地区正在展开大规模的测图工作，需要把少数民族语言的地名，准确地译成汉语；国际事务报道频繁的今天，地图上的地名和报纸上的地名需要统一。再则，经验告诉我们，每个地名只要在地图上出现一次，社会上随即产生了作用，再要更改变动，那是相当费力的。所以地名译音的规范化工作，不能落在地图制作生产的后面，而应赶在前面。党早就看到了这点，所以国家科委在制订十二年科学远景规划时，就提出了地名译音这一课题。地图出版社在国家测绘总局领导下，承担了研究和组织任务。该社在地图编绘和出版上，在党的正确领导和关怀下，虽然做了不少工作，例如，由1955年到1959年发行的教学地图一项，就超过二亿三千万册（幅），做到中小学生人手一册，这是我国历史上从来没有过的。但对国家科委交下的这项课题，主观力量和客观的要求不相适应。不仅干部的理论水平跟正确体现国家的外交政策、民族政策和文教政策的要求适应不够，就是专业知识也不够，特别是缺乏语言学的基本训练，对于好些种外国语和少数民族语言处于文盲状态。党告诉我们：只要政治挂帅，依靠领导、依靠协作，任何困难都可克服。党又提出了边做边学，做好学会的方针，工作同志就信心百倍地干起来了。
    在探索工作方法和方向时，我们首先接触的是音译和意译的划分问题，即哪些地名或地名中的哪些部分应当音译，哪些应当意译。对这个问题的看法，各方面是不一致的。
    其次是标准音问题。在音译外国地名时，需要解决的是汉语的标准音，这在大力推广普通话的前提下，已经得到了解决。但在音译少数民族语言地名时，还存在着少数民族语的标准音问题。上述蒙语“河”字所以产生十九种不同译法的原因，除受了翻译工作者的方言影响外，蒙语本身方言的变化也是一个原因。这是一个非常细致复杂的社会问题，也是专门的语言研究问题，看起来不是短期所能解决的。
    第三是译音准确和译名读音问题。汉字普通话音节，根据常用汉字拼音表只有四百多个。用这样少而且死板的音节来音译多种多样的非汉语语音，那是难于胜任的。例如集二铁路线上的二连车站，“二连”两字的读音和蒙语读音出入很大，蒙古族同志就听不懂，又非汉语中有复辅音的音节，译成汉字后，往往变成两个或三个音节，造成译名冗长，诘屈聱牙，难念又难记。常常听到中小学的同学说，地理课很有趣，就是地名不好念不好记。这个问题如何解决，也是有待研究的。
    第四是汉语拼音方案的正确运用问题。汉字只能代表音节，汉语拼音字母还能代表音素，这是文字工具上的重大贡献。用音素译音比用音节译音，要准确得多、也方便得多。但社会上对用汉语拼音字母音译非汉语地名时，究竟应当直接从原文音译，还是间接按着汉字译名逐字注音，意见还不一致。
  第五是如何全民利用问题。现在已有十多个少数民族在汉语拼音方案的基础上，创造了拉丁字母式的民族新文字方案。因为在各少数民族新文字中，相同字母的用法和读音是基本上一致的，不难设想，如果汉语拼音方案运用恰当，在地名拼写上既发挥相互间的共同性，又保留彼此间的特殊性，那么，在两条腿走路的原则下，在用汉字译音的同时，用汉语拼音字母拼写的地名，必将成为全国各民族乐于共同使用的一种形式。有了一张用汉语拼音字母拼写地名的地图，全国各民族都可以利用。这在民族团结上既有深远的意义，在地图制作生产上，也是十分有利的。
    最后是如何促进文字改革的远大理想问题。周总理指出过：“文字总是要变化的，……世界各个民族的文字形式将来总有一天会逐渐统一。”世界上现有六十多个国家的文字是拉丁字母式的。音译这些国家的地名有两种方法，即
  “音似”和“形似”。“音似”便于听，“形似”便于读，各有长处和缺点。用汉字译音时，只能“音似”不能“形似”。汉语拼音方案诞生后，情况改变了，用汉语拼音字母译音，既可“音似”又可“形似”。拉丁字母式的地名在国际上有比较广泛的流通性，所以在名从主人的原则下，如果创造性地做好了“音似”和
  “形似”的结合，那么，通过地名可以提供大量的国际通用字汇，为实现世界文字逐渐统一创造条件。这一设想也是值得研究的。
    以上所说的一些问题或设想，涉及的面很广，在一般情况下是不易解决的。通过大协作，我们现在已订出了若干种初步方案。首先，作为保证完成这一巨大任务的组织措施，地名译音委员会在党的重视下组织起来了。虽然科学研究和生产部门本身的任务很重，但都指派领导同志或专家参加了委员会。通过委员同志的辛勤劳动，在五个月中举行了五次小组会议，三次全体会议后，就拟订了地名翻译原则草案四种，并在四种期刊上发表。发表后受到社会上的重视，进一步获得了建设性的意见，并展开了学术性的辩论，使草案又提高了一步。
    为了调查地名的少数民族语言的书面形式，从而科学地核对整理地名译音，自治区或省里的行政部门、科学研究单位及大学都发动了大批干部及地理系或史地系的师生，提供资料或下到县里进行调查。现在大型地图集上需要的少数民族地区的地名，已搜集到或正在搜集汉字和少数民族文字对照的地名资料。从这些资料中，不仅进一步反映了地名译音的混乱情况，而且从积极方面纠正了现行地图上的传统错误，使地图的质量获得了提高。
    为了制订地名译音规范，中央和地方的文字改革、少数民族语言研究、翻译、出版单位都指派很多专家来帮助我们进行研究和起草工作。经过反复的、热烈的讨论，现在汉译蒙语、汉译维语及汉译藏语地名简则（草稿）各一种，已草拟完成，并开始在地图制作过程中试用。
    以上各项工作虽然仅仅是一个开始，但我国制图学史上是从来没有这样彻底搞过的。这样促进了科学的发展，必须归功于党，正如李先念副总理在报告中所提到的，是全国人民在党的教育下，发扬了把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人的高尚精神，协作成风，送宝上门，助人为乐的形势下获得的。
    毛主席告诉我们：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮”。因此我们不能满足于现有的成绩，必须向前更迈进一步。研究地名意义的起源及其词义是地名学的任务，它在苏联已从地理学及语言学分支出来，成为一门独立的学科。我们在这方面，直到现在还是一个空白点。为了积极地发展这门目前还是空白的学科，赶上国际水平，我们测量制图工作者殷切地希望把地名学作为一个空白的学科，迅速建设起来。
    通过地名学的建立，地名译音的质量必然大大提高一步，不仅科学上的准确性和系统性会改变历史面貌，而且在政治思想上将有质的变化。但这些变革还要依靠准确的原始资料，即用各个少数民族自己的文字，根据正字法写出的地名。希望少数民族同志和熟悉少数民族地区地理或语言的同志，多多提供资料和提出宝贵的改进意见，掀起一个群众性的协作高潮，一同来搞好党的测量制图事业。
