Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch: Today marks the first anniversary of the Japanese people's unified action against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Japanese people are launching their 15th unified action against the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" across the country. This unified action will continue until the 26th.

　　The workers from eighty-five industrial unions and independent unions of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) took the lead in holding strikes and workplace rallies across the country today. In many places, unions jointly held mass rallies with local organizations of the National Council Against Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

　　In Tokyo, the National Council Against Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" convened a meeting attended by representatives from fifty-five mass organizations opposing the revision of the new "Security Treaty." At this meeting, representatives from various organizations expressed their determination to wage a resolute struggle to prevent the Diet from passing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." They also reported on the activities of their respective organizations against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

　　Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Socialist Party, expressed the Socialist Party's determination at a crucial stage in the struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." He said that the Socialist Party will resolutely oppose the Liberal Democratic Party's attempt to force the Diet to conclude deliberations on the treaty before sufficient debate has taken place.

　　Kenji Miyamoto, General Secretary of the Communist Party, called on the representatives attending the meeting to make efforts to fully unleash the people's power against the Diet's passage of the new "Security Treaty."

　　Hirozo Mizuguchi, Secretary-General of the National Council Against Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," said in his speech that nearly six million people have already signed petitions to the Diet opposing the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

　　Ikuo Yasui, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, emphasized in his speech that the broad masses of the people are indignant at those who attempt to forcibly pass the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet. Yasui called on those attending the meeting: "Let us embody this universal anger and direct its spearhead at the Liberal Democratic Party."

　　Yoshio Yanagimoto, head of the political department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, said that workers in public corporations had already forced the government's labor-management conciliation body to agree to an increase of 800 yen per person per month in wages this morning. He emphasized that the Sohyo workers, encouraged by this good news, will strengthen their struggle and, in the near future, will concentrate their efforts on holding strikes to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

　　A representative of the "Research Association on Security Treaty Issues," composed of 3,500 scholars, said that cultural figures will hold a large-scale petition to the Diet on April 19th and 20th.

　　Yoko Matsuoka, a representative of the "Security Treaty Criticism Association," also stated that the members are determined to take resolute action at this important stage of the struggle.

　　Buddhist representatives said that two Buddhists will begin a hunger strike in front of a temple in Tokyo tomorrow to express their opposition to the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." He asked the participants to support the Buddhists' protest action.

　　The meeting adopted an appeal to the Japanese people. The appeal pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government and the ruling party are now attempting to unilaterally conclude the Diet's deliberations on the new "Security Treaty," as they fear that if the debate is prolonged, the treaty's aggressive nature will be further exposed.

　　The appeal called on all the people to petition the Diet on April 26th against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

　　At the same time, 1,200 students today submitted a petition to the Diet opposing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

　　According to the plan of the National Council Against Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," a central rally against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" will be held in Tokyo on the 16th and 17th. Japanese women will hold a women's rally on the 16th against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. On the last day of this unified action, the 26th, a demonstration of 100,000 people will be held to the Diet.
