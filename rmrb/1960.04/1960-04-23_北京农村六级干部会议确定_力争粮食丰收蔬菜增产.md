    Beijing Rural Six-Level Cadre Meeting Determines
    to Strive for a Bumper Grain Harvest and Increased Vegetable Production

    (Our Newspaper News) The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a rural six-level cadre meeting from March 29th to April 13th to discuss the rapid development of agricultural production in the suburbs and the further consolidation and development of the people's communes. The meeting required Party organizations at all levels in the suburbs to continue to vigorously carry out mass movements, earnestly focus on grain, vegetable, and pig production, and rapidly set off a new upsurge in agricultural technology revolution, in order to realize a better and more comprehensive continued great leap forward in agricultural production in 1960 and to strive for the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program. The meeting called on all trades and industries in the city to support agriculture and contribute to the great historical task of realizing the modernization of agriculture in the capital. At the meeting, Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave important instructions, and Chen Peng, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, gave a summary of the meeting.

    This meeting was convened under the excellent situation of the consolidation and development of the people's communes and the vigorous unfolding of spring plowing and production. The cadres attending the meeting summarized the characteristics of the current new upsurge of the Great Leap Forward as: One Big (great enthusiasm of the masses), Two Early (early start to spring plowing, early implementation of the "Three Guarantees" system), Three Many (many fertilizers accumulated, many water conservancy projects, many tool reforms), and Four Good (good quality of fertilizers and farm work, good growth of wheat seedlings and spring vegetables, good arrangement of commune members' lives, good implementation of policies). At present, the irrigated area in the suburbs has increased by 30% compared with the same period last year; the sowing of early spring vegetables has completed one and a half times the planned amount; and the area of spring afforestation is close to the total of the past eight years. The meeting unanimously agreed that the continuous increase in the income of the people's communes, the continuous expansion of public accumulation, the vigorous development of the collective economy, and the healthy growth of collective welfare undertakings have powerfully promoted this year's spring plowing and production and accelerated the speed of realizing mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification in the suburbs.

    After freely discussing the excellent situation, the meeting emphasized that the current task of Party organizations at all levels is to continue to vigorously carry out mass movements, educate all Party members, League members, and all commune members to recognize the situation, strengthen organizational leadership, and do a good job in spring plowing and sowing, so as to lay a solid foundation for realizing a bumper harvest of grain, a large increase in vegetable production, and a great development of pig raising this year. To this end, a series of arduous tasks must be carried out, especially to cultivate well several high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes, corn, and multi-eared sorghum, which account for more than half of the cultivated land in the suburbs, and to accelerate the increase in grain production in order to meet the needs of agriculture, animal husbandry, and certain industrial raw materials. The meeting believes that in the current situation of the increasing development of urban construction and the continuous growth of grain needs in various aspects, the people's communes in the suburbs must regard cultivating high-yield crops well and winning more grain as an important political and economic task. On the agricultural front, we must strive to overfulfill this year's water conservancy construction tasks to ensure timely irrigation of high-yield crops. At the same time, we must accumulate more fertilizer, earnestly implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and ensure the quality of operations. At the same time, on the basis of the implementation of the "Three Guarantees" system, we must mobilize the masses to launch a vigorous overproduction campaign.

    The meeting pointed out that in order to ensure the realization of a comprehensive and sustained leap forward in agriculture, the Party committees at all levels in the suburbs must effectively strengthen leadership over the technical innovation and technical revolution movement that is currently vigorously unfolding in the countryside, sum up experiences, fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses to break superstitions, and boldly innovate through self-reliance. At present, it is particularly necessary to do a good job in the complete set of innovations for spring sowing tools, feeding tools, and canteen cooking utensils.

    The system of people's communes is a fundamental guarantee for continuously maintaining the high speed of agricultural production and construction and realizing the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. The meeting believes that the people's communes in the suburbs, after implementing the three-level ownership system with the production team as the foundation in March last year and carrying out a comprehensive rectification, have embarked on the road of consolidated and healthy development. Therefore, at present, we should clarify the direction, work diligently, do a good job in production, strengthen education, and help the poor teams catch up with the rich teams as soon as possible, so as to create conditions for the transition from the basic ownership of the production team to the basic ownership of the commune, on the premise of ensuring the comprehensive development of the three-level ownership economy of the commune. In developing the economy at the commune level, we must mainly rely on the accumulation of the commune and the profits of the commune-level enterprises, plus state loans and investments, to build various factories and enterprises that serve agricultural production, serve the "Four Modernizations," and serve the national large-scale industry and the socialist market, so as to gradually expand the proportion of the economy at the commune level, thereby driving the development of the entire commune economy and improving the economic level of the entire commune.

    The vast number of rural cadres are the leading force in implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction, organizing the great leap forward in agricultural production, and consolidating and developing the people's communes. Most of these comrades have a correct ideology and work style, are full of energy, have high revolutionary enthusiasm, and enjoy prestige among the commune members. However, under the new situation of the current comprehensive and sustained leap forward and the increasingly complex and detailed work of commune operation and management, it is obviously necessary to rapidly and continuously improve. After analyzing the above-mentioned situation of the rural cadre contingent, the meeting emphasized that all rural cadres must strive to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, strive to improve their political and ideological level and professional skills, better establish a good work style of being prudent, fair, disciplined, and diligently serving the people, earnestly implement the Party's mass line, effectively improve the leadership methods of cadres at all levels, implement the policy of running communes and all undertakings diligently and frugally, resolutely oppose corruption, oppose waste, and oppose bureaucracy and commandism, and must completely treat people with an equal attitude. The leading organs at all levels must adhere to the system of cadres participating in labor, completely integrate with the masses, be good at relying on and giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses; and, better learn to grasp production with one hand and life with the other, run the collective welfare undertakings centered on the public canteen well, and care for the lives of the masses. Only in this way can all the rural cadres in the suburbs greatly improve a step, and lead the 2.8 million people in the entire suburbs to quickly realize the great historical task of modernizing agriculture in the capital's suburbs.

    北京农村六级干部会议确定
    力争粮食丰收蔬菜增产
    本报讯　中共北京市委于3月29日至4月13日召开了农村六级干部会议，讨论了迅速发展郊区农业生产和进一步巩固发展人民公社的问题。会议要求郊区各级党组织要继续大搞群众运动，切实抓好粮食、蔬菜和养猪生产，迅速掀起农业技术革命新高潮，为实现1960年农业生产更好、更全面的继续大跃进和提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗。会议号召全市各行各业都来支援农业，为实现首都农业现代化的伟大历史任务贡献自己的力量。会上中共北京市委第二书记刘仁做了重要指示，市委书记处书记陈鹏做了大会总结。
    这次会议是在人民公社巩固发展，春耕生产蓬勃展开的大好形势下召开的。到会干部以：一大（群众干劲大），二早（春耕抓得早、三包落实早），三多（肥料积的多、水利工程多、工具改革多），四好（肥料和农活的质量好、麦苗春菜长的好、社员生活安排好、政策贯彻执行好）概括了当前跃进新高潮的特点。目前郊区灌溉面积较去年同期增加30％；早春蔬菜播种完成计划一倍半；春季造林面积接近过去八年的总和。会议一致认为，人民公社收入的连年增加、公共积累的不断扩大、社有经济的蓬勃发展、集体福利事业的健康成长，有力地促进了今年的春耕生产，加快了郊区实现机械化、水利化、电气化的速度。
    会议在畅谈大好形势之后着重指出，当前各级党组织的任务是要继续大搞群众运动，教育全体党员、团员，全体社员认清形势，加强组织领导，搞好春耕播种工作，为实现今年粮食大丰收、蔬菜大增产、养猪大发展打下牢固基础。为此，必须进行一系列的艰苦工作，特别是要把占郊区耕地一半以上的白薯、玉米和多穗高粱等几种高产作物种好，加速增产粮食，以适应农业、畜牧业发展和某些工业原料的需要。会议认为，在目前城市建设日益发展，各方面粮食需要不断增长的情况下，郊区人民公社必须把种好高产作物夺得更多的粮食，作为一项重要的政治任务和经济任务。农业战线上要力争超额完成今年的水利建设任务，保证高产作物及时灌溉，同时要多积肥料，认真贯彻执行农业八字宪法，保证作业质量。同时还要在三包落实的基础上，发动群众，开展一个轰轰烈烈的超产运动。
    会议指出，保证实现农业全面持续跃进，郊区各级党委要对当前农村正在蓬勃开展的技术革新、技术革命运动切实加强领导，总结经验，充分发动群众依靠群众破除迷信，自力更生进行大胆革新。当前特别要作好春播工具、饲养工具、食堂炊具的成套革新。
    人民公社制度是持续地保持农业生产建设的高速度、提前实现农业发展纲要的根本保障。会议认为郊区人民公社从去年3月实行了队为基础的三级所有制并进行了全面整顿以后，已经走上了巩固地健康发展的道路。因此，目前应当明确方向，埋头苦干，搞好生产，加强教育，尽快地帮助穷队赶富队，在保证公社三级所有制经济全面发展的前提下，为从队基本所有制过渡到公社基本所有制创造条件。在发展公社一级的经济时，必须主要依靠公社的积累和公社一级企业的利润，加上国家的贷款及投资，兴建各种为农业生产服务、为“四化”服务、为国家大工业及社会主义市场服务的工厂企业，逐步扩大公社一级经济的比重，从而带动整个公社经济的发展，提高整个公社的经济水平。
    广大农村干部是贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线、组织农业生产大跃进和巩固发展人民公社的领导力量。这些同志中，绝大部分是思想作风正派，干劲十足，革命热情很高，在社员群众中享有威信。但是，在当前全面持续跃进和公社经营管理工作日趋复杂细致的新形势下，显然必须要迅速地不断地提高。会议在分析了农村干部队伍的上述情况之后，强调指出，全体农村干部必须努力学习毛泽东同志的著作，努力提高自己的政治思想业务水平，更好树立谨慎公正守纪律，勤勤恳恳为人民服务的良好作风，认真地贯彻执行党的群众路线，切实改进各级干部的领导方法，贯彻执行勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的方针，坚决地反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义、命令主义作风，要完全作到以平等态度待人。各级领导机关必须坚持干部参加劳动的制度，和群众完全打成一片，善于依靠和发挥群众的积极性和创造性；并且，要更好地学会一手抓生产，一手抓生活，办好以公共食堂为中心的集体福利事业，关心群众生活。只有这样，郊区的全体农村干部才能大大提高一步，才能领导全郊区二百八十万人迅速地实现首都郊区农业现代化的伟大历史任务。
