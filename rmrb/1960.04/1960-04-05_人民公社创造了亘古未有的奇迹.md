Comrade Representatives:

I fully endorse the reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I will speak on how Henan Province, since July 1959, has relied on the people's communes to overcome drought and achieve a great agricultural harvest.

**If the Sky Doesn't Rain, People Will; Bumper Harvests Depend on People, Not Heaven**

From July last year to the beginning of March this year, for two hundred and fifty days, all one hundred and eighteen counties and cities in the province, except for a dozen counties with lighter droughts, were in a state of severe drought. In the three months of July, August, and September last year, the average rainfall in the province was 189 millimeters, a decrease of more than half compared to the average rainfall of over 400 millimeters in the same period in normal years; and this 189 millimeters of rainfall was scattered and accumulated over multiple occasions. Most areas of the province experienced no rain during the hottest periods of summer. As soon as the drought appeared, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the battle cry of "The whole Party mobilizes, all people pledge, resist drought to the end, ensure a bumper harvest without rain." Within the province, a massive and magnificent movement to combat drought and ensure a bumper harvest was quickly launched. Especially after the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was conveyed, the anti-rightist sentiment was strengthened, morale was boosted, and the drought resistance movement formed an even greater high tide. Industry supported agriculture, the army supported the local areas, and workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers twisted into one rope, with more than one million cadres and more than twenty million people joining the drought resistance struggle. They braved the scorching heat of forty degrees Celsius, battling day and night, irrigating 270 million mu-times, and using more than 18 billion cubic meters of water, equivalent to several artificial heavy rains. The people of the province finally overcame the hundred-day drought and won a great autumn harvest. People used such verses to praise their labor achievements:

"If the sky doesn't rain, people will; bumper harvests depend on people, not heaven."

After the autumn harvest, the drought continued to develop, and the people of the province then launched a drought-resistant wheat planting campaign. In the face of extremely difficult water sources, 80 million mu of wheat were planted against the drought, exceeding the original planting target. For example, the people of Lin County, in the drought-resistant wheat planting, expanded the "Hero Canal" project, using a heroic spirit that shook mountains and rivers, cut through 359 ridges in the majestic Taihang Mountains, filled in 569 ditches, carved mountain caves, and built sky bridges, extending the "Hero Canal" to 547 li, expanding the irrigation area, and completing the wheat planting task in a timely manner.

Since the beginning of winter, there has still been little snow and rain. The people of the province launched a winter production campaign centered on water conservancy construction, pig raising and manure accumulation, and wheat field management. In the cold winter, a new high tide of water conservancy construction was set off. At the same time, wheat field management was strengthened, 58 million mu of frozen water was poured, and warm seedling fertilizer was widely applied to ensure the normal growth of wheat seedlings. For example, the Yaozhai Brigade of the Zhaihe People's Commune in Guangshan County concentrated 45 waterwheels and adopted the method of "multiple immortals passing on the Tao," step-by-step water lifting, and transferred the water from "Moon Lake," which was fifteen li away, through twenty-one turns, to the fifteen-zhang-high ridge, irrigating more than 230 mu of land. When the commune members saw the lake water climbing the mountain, they happily sang: "Water has always flowed down the mountain, where have you seen water going up the mountain? The commune can reverse the universe, and let the lake water turn over the mountain!"

Since the beginning of spring this year, the drought has developed more seriously. Most reservoirs, pits, and ponds have dried up, the flow of large rivers has decreased, the flow of medium and small rivers has been cut off, and the groundwater level has continued to decline. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the battle cry of "The whole Party and the whole people move together, resist the drought until the sky bows its head, and vow to win a great wheat harvest." A 12 million-strong wheat irrigation army skillfully uses surface water, digs deep groundwater, builds water lifting equipment, and carries out engineering and tool coordination in every possible way to expand the irrigation area. This spring drought resistance movement has two characteristics: one is to drill wells and deep springs in the plains area to implement a double insurance of well-canal irrigation; and the other is to build reservoirs, drill wells, and build large pumping stations in the mountainous and hilly areas to implement irrigation mechanization, vigorously divert water to the mountains, and advance to the areas with the most difficult water conservancy conditions, fundamentally solving the water conservancy problem in mountainous and hilly areas. In this movement, the labor force invested in drilling wells in the province often exceeds 1.1 million people, and more than 69,000 machine wells have been completed; more than 3,600 new pumping stations have been built in the mountainous and hilly areas of the province, irrigating more than 4 million mu of land. In this drought resistance struggle, urban industries and other aspects have provided greater and more support to agriculture. Urban industrial and mining enterprises, on the one hand, accelerated the production of water conservancy machinery, and on the other hand, transferred a large number of technical workers to go deep into the countryside to repair machines and impart technology. The total mobilization of the whole Party and the whole people formed a new high tide of drought resistance. According to statistics in mid-March, more than 60 million mu of wheat fields have been spring irrigated in the province, of which more than 35 million mu have been irrigated more than twice. At present, the growth of wheat seedlings is generally good. Commune members in various places are continuing to strengthen wheat field management and are fighting for a greater summer harvest this year.

**Compare with 1942**

Comrade Representatives, the severity of the drought in Henan this time, the length of time, and the size of the area all far exceed the great drought of 1942. In 1942, more than 50 counties suffered from drought, lasting more than 50 days, covering an area of more than 60 million mu, and the degree of drought was far less severe than this time. However, at that time, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, the Japanese invaders, and the landlord bullies, heavy taxes were levied, extorted, and fortunes were made from disasters. Natural disasters plus man-made disasters dragged the people of Henan into the abyss of heavy disasters, creating a tragic scene of barren land, starvation, death, family destruction, and separation of wives and children. In that year alone, more than 13 million people in Henan left their homes and fled to beg for food, and more than 3 million people were starved to death. Recalling it, it is truly chilling! But what is the situation today? Since July 1959, more than 90 counties have suffered from drought, more than 40 counties more than in 1942, the drought time is 200 days longer than in 1942, and the drought-affected area is nearly 100 million mu, accounting for more than 80% of the province's cultivated land area, more than 30 million mu more than in 1942. In such a serious situation, not only has the province not reduced production, but it has also won a great autumn harvest. In 1959, the total agricultural output value increased by 21.9% compared with the great leap forward of 1958, and the total grain output increased by 13.75%. The output of other crops such as cotton, oil, and flue-cured tobacco also increased greatly. The entire countryside showed a thriving and vigorous leaping forward scene. Farmers generally sing: "In the past, when we encountered drought years, we prayed to gods and Buddhas and suffered torture; now, when we encounter drought years, we do not ask the Dragon King and do not rely on Heaven. Tens of millions of people come to resist drought, and a hundred days of drought ensure a bumper harvest; happiness no longer depends on Heaven, the power of the commune is boundless!" From these vivid and clear factual comparisons, we can clearly see how painful and dark the old society was, and how happy and bright the new society is! The unprecedented miracle that appeared in Henan in 1959 eloquently illustrates that the people's commune system has unparalleled superiority, and shows that the working people are the true creators of history.

Chairman Mao said: "The result of the mutual struggle between the contradictory opposing sides is invariably transformed into each other under certain conditions." "Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results," "Bad things can also be transformed into good things." The practice of drought resistance eloquently proves that this is an unbreakable truth. Drought is a bad thing, but the Party leads the people to fight against nature and has achieved great achievements, turning it into a good thing. The great drought resistance struggle not only ensured a great agricultural harvest, promoted the comprehensive leap forward in rural water conservancy construction, pig raising and manure accumulation, technological innovation and technological revolution, but also promoted the great development of industry, especially the steel industry, and promoted the great development of socialist construction undertakings such as transportation, finance and trade, science, culture, education, and health. What is particularly important is that the spiritual outlook of the people has undergone tremendous changes, the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do has been greatly promoted, the ambition to conquer nature has become more and more firm, and the great era of the working people dominating nature has begun.

**People's Communes Show Great Power in the Drought Resistance Struggle**

Why were the people of Henan able to overcome such a serious drought and achieve such great achievements? This is the result of giving full play to the superiority of the people's communes under the wise leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao and under the shining of the Party's general line for building socialism. When the drought resistance began, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao instructed us: Go all out, be sure to persevere in the drought resistance struggle to the end, man will conquer nature, and strive for a bumper harvest. The people of the province resolutely implemented the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, gave full play to the powerful power of the people's communes, and finally overcame "Heaven." How did the people's communes exert their powerful power in the drought resistance struggle?

The people's communes have the characteristics of combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, integrating government and communes, and being large and public. They can better unify and mobilize human, material, and financial resources to carry out larger-scale water conservancy construction. Since the drought resistance began, a total of 2,010 large, medium, and small reservoirs, more than 327,000 ponds, dams, and dikes, 1.8 million wells, and 1.07 million canals have been built, expanding the irrigation area by 27 million mu, equivalent to four times the irrigation area built in the thousands of years before liberation. At the same time, the irrigation area has been improved by 28 million mu, with a total of more than 6 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work. These brilliant achievements in water conservancy construction have greatly enhanced our ability to fight against natural disasters. Before communization, the masses could only carry out small-scale farmland water conservancy; after communization, the masses could not only carry out small and medium-sized water conservancy projects, but also carry out large-scale water conservancy projects. Among the 38 large-scale water conservancy projects that started construction in our province last winter and this spring, there are nine large reservoirs with a water storage capacity of more than 100 million cubic meters, which were built by the communes themselves or jointly by the communes. This was impossible before communization. The Malou People's Commune in Lushan County built the Penghe Reservoir, opened the Penghe Canal, which is 20 li long, forcing the Penghe River to flow backward, irrigating 55,000 mu of land, and agricultural production has achieved an unprecedented great harvest. The commune members praised: "The people's commune is strong, locking up the old Dragon King for thousands of years; the Penghe River flows backwards and is water conservancy, and the poor river becomes a land of fish and rice; from then on, the harmful river becomes a beneficial river, and the people are happy and boundless."

People's communes have raised the political awareness of commune members, changed the relationship between people, and made it easier to organize communist-style large-scale cooperation. In the drought resistance struggle, production teams and production teams, communes and communes, and even counties and counties, organized large-scale cooperation according to the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, taking into account the upstream and downstream, and supporting each other on the left and right banks to expand water sources and use water rationally. For example, ten people's communes in Nanyang, Xinye, Deng County, and Tanghe counties in the Nanyang Special Zone adopted the method of centralized leadership, concentrated labor, concentrated technical forces, and concentrated materials and materials to establish a million-mu machine well area, which has already drilled 2,900 machine wells, and has already irrigated 550,000 mu of land with machine wells alone. With the addition of the gravity irrigation of the canals, the task of watering wheat has been completed to a high standard, realizing the double insurance of well-canal irrigation. For another example, the people's communes in Yiyang County organized 20 pumping station work teams, transferred 50 technicians, and conducted surveys and planning of pumping stations on a ditch-by-ditch, ridge-by-ridge, and watershed-by-watershed basis. At present, 183 mechanical irrigation stations are under construction in the county, and 58,000 mu of land have been irrigated. The experience of establishing a million-mu machine well area in the Nanyang Special Zone and the experience of building large pumping stations in Yiyang County are currently being rapidly promoted throughout the province.

People's communes have many people and wise plans, and have commune-run industries, which make it easy to carry out technological innovation and technological revolution. The in-depth development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement has greatly accelerated water conservancy construction and powerfully promoted the drought resistance struggle. Since last winter, a total of more than 5.5 million pieces of various water conservancy construction tools have been created and promoted, and many construction sites have achieved semi-mechanization in the processes of digging, transporting, loading, unloading, and tamping; the average work efficiency in the province has increased from 1.1 cubic meters of earth and stone per person per day to 11 cubic meters. The Huashan Reservoir in Biyang County can produce 108 cubic meters of earthwork per person per day. New creations and developments have been made in blasting construction. For example, the Jiliao Commune in Linru County adopted the "string of pearls" blasting construction method to open canals, organizing 3,600 blasters, drilling 23,000 holes on the 45-li-long construction site, uniformly loading explosives, and uniformly setting off artillery, completing 240,000 cubic meters of earth and stone at one time, accounting for 96% of the earth and stone task. The masses happily said: "There was no construction before setting off the artillery, and the finishing work was done after setting off the artillery." The "rocket cone," a well-drilling weapon created by the People's Commune in Changge County, has been promoted in various parts of the province according to local conditions. Since last winter, the province has created, modified, and imitated more than 10,000 sets of 80 types of "rocket cones." In the past, it took more than a month to drill a seven- or eight-zhang-deep well, but now it generally takes only three to five days to drill a fifteen-zhang-deep machine well, and the fastest takes only ten hours, increasing efficiency by ten to dozens of times.

People's communes have comprehensively developed agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery and commune-run enterprises, rapidly increased public accumulation, purchased a large number of drainage and irrigation machinery and water lifting tools, and played a major role in the drought resistance struggle. In 1959, the accumulation of the people's communes in the province increased by more than double compared with 1958. Communes purchased 220,000 waterwheels; purchased 224,000 horsepower of drainage and irrigation machinery, an increase of 109% compared with 1958. Over the past year, commune industry in the province has made great progress. After rectification, there are now more than 60,000 commune-run factories in rural areas. In 1959, the total output value of commune-run industry reached more than 1 billion yuan, an increase of 54.4% compared with 1958. Most of the equipment and materials needed in the drought resistance struggle in various places were manufactured by the commune factories themselves, except for a part supplied by the state. Commune-run factories have made extremely significant achievements in manufacturing and repairing water conservancy construction tools and water lifting tools, and have powerfully supported the drought resistance struggle.

The public canteens of the people's communes are fully adapted to the needs of large-scale collective production and have played an extremely important role in the drought resistance struggle. Public canteens have strengthened the collectiveist thinking of commune members, cultivated the collective living habits of commune members, and improved the enthusiasm and labor efficiency of commune members; they can also ensure the consistent work and rest time of commune members, ensure that commune members eat enough, eat well, and eat economically; they can liberate a large amount of female labor and enable a large number of women to go to the forefront of the drought resistance struggle and various production and construction projects. Without public canteens, it would be impossible for the province to regularly deploy about 20 million laborers to carry out large-scale battles in the drought resistance struggle. Precisely because public canteens are suitable for the needs of large-scale collective production after communization, the 330,000 public canteens in the province have been getting better and better in the 250-day drought resistance struggle and have been warmly supported by the majority of commune members.

In the process of the drought resistance struggle, fraternal provinces, cities, and autonomous regions such as Hebei, Jilin, Shanghai, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Beijing, Shandong, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Zhejiang, with a noble communist style, allocated a large number of drought resistance materials to support the people of Henan. This is also an important reason why we have achieved victory in the drought resistance struggle. Now I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to these fraternal provinces, cities, and autonomous regions on behalf of the people of Henan Province!

**Advance Triumphantly, Continue to Fight**

Comrade Representatives, the people's communes have only been born for more than a year, not only can they withstand the test of such serious natural disasters, showing such great power to resist natural disasters and transform nature, conquer nature, and benefit the people, but also embark on a more consolidated and sound development path. In 1959, the various undertakings undertaken by the people's communes in our province achieved a leap forward development, and public accumulation increased greatly; 72% of the poor teams caught up with the rich teams or general teams; more than 90% of the commune members increased their income, and the lives of commune members were further improved. The 1,210 people's communes in the province are as solid as steel. In the process of overcoming drought, the broad masses of farmers have more firmly linked their fate more closely with the fate of the commune. The reason why the people's communes have such great power and can open up an infinitely broad road for the development of social productive forces is because they fully conform to the fundamental principle of Marxism that the relations of production must be suitable for the nature of productive forces. Imperialists cursed our general line, great leap forward, and people's communes, and spread shameless lies such as the "collapse" of the people's communes and the "great failure" of the people's communes; right-leaning opportunists criticized the people's communes for being "done too early," "done badly," and "water conservancy is not worth the loss," and so on. These absurd arguments have been completely shattered by the iron fact of the victory of the great drought resistance struggle of the people of Henan.

The drought resistance struggle of the people of Henan has achieved great victory. However, there are still many arduous tasks before us in striving for a comprehensive great harvest in agricultural production in 1960. Since mid-March, the province has successively experienced rain and snow, and most areas have been thoroughly moistened or basically thoroughly moistened, and the drought situation in these areas has been temporarily alleviated. However, some areas still need to continue to resist drought; that is, in areas where the soil is thoroughly moistened or basically thoroughly moistened, the rainfall is still not large, there is no runoff, many reservoirs, pits, and ponds have not stored water, the river flow is still very small or cut off, and the weather is getting hotter, the evaporation is getting larger and larger, and the amount of water needed for crop growth is increasing. Therefore, we must not have the slightest sense of麻痹and slackness, we must mobilize the people of the province to advance triumphantly, continue to fight, resist drought if there is drought, prevent drought if there is no drought, insist on vigorously building machine well areas, vigorously taking groundwater, vigorously building pumping stations, vigorously building water lifting equipment, and at the same time vigorously carrying out pig raising and manure accumulation, vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, vigorously carrying out the overproduction movement of steel, organizing industry and other aspects to vigorously support agriculture, and making every effort to win a great harvest of 80 million mu of summer harvest crops, and ensure that 40 million mu of spring sowing crops are planted early, quickly, and well, and lay a solid foundation for this year's sustained, comprehensive, and better leap forward.

At present, the political and economic situation in our province, like the rest of the country, is very good. We believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of Henan Province will raise the red flag of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes even higher, and will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties on the road forward and realize the sustained leap forward of the entire national economy in our province in 1960.

If there is anything inappropriate in the above speech, please correct it, comrade representatives.

    人民公社创造了亘古未有的奇迹
    赵文甫代表谈河南人民怎样充分发挥人民公社的优越性，战胜连续二百五十天的干旱，夺取农业大丰收各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和人大常委会所作的各项报告。现在我仅就河南省从1959年7月以来，是怎样依靠人民公社战胜干旱夺取农业大丰收的问题，作如下发言。
    天不下雨人下雨，丰收由人不由天
    从去年7月到今年3月上旬的二百五十天，全省一百一十八个县市，除十几个县干旱较轻外，其余县市都一直处在严重干旱中。在去年7、8、9三个月，全省平均降雨量一百八十九毫米，比常年同期降雨量四百多毫米，减少一半还多；而这一百八十九毫米的雨量，下得零星分散，是多次累计起来的。全省大部分地区三伏无雨。旱象刚一发生，中共河南省委就提出了“全党动员，万民发誓，有旱抗到底，无雨保丰收”的战斗口号。在全省范围内，很快就掀起了一个声势浩大、规模壮阔的抗旱保丰收运动。特别是党的八届八中全会决议传达以后，反右倾，鼓干劲，抗旱运动形成了更大的高潮。工业支援农业，军队支援地方，工农商学兵拧成一股绳，投入抗旱斗争的干部有一百多万人，群众有二千多万人。他们冒着四十度的酷暑炎热，昼夜鏖战，抗旱浇地面积达到二亿七千万亩次，用水量达到一百八十多亿公方，等于人工降了几次大雨。全省人民终于战胜了百日大旱，夺得了秋季大丰收。人们用这样的诗句来歌颂自己的劳动成果：
    “天不下雨人下雨，丰收由人不由天。”
    秋收以后，干旱继续发展，全省人民接着开展了抗旱种麦运动。在水源十分困难的情况下，抗旱种麦八千多万亩，超额完成了原定播种任务。例如，林县人民在抗旱种麦中，扩建了“英雄渠”工程，以摇撼山河的英雄气概，在巍峨的太行山腰，劈开了三百五十九个岭，填平了五百六十九道沟，凿山洞，架天桥，把“英雄渠”延长到五百四十七华里，扩大了灌溉面积，适时完成了种麦任务。
    入冬以后，仍然少雪缺雨。全省人民开展了以水利建设、养猪积肥和麦田管理为中心的冬季生产运动。在严寒的冬季，掀起了水利建设的新高潮，同时加强麦田管理，浇封冻水五千八百万亩，普施了暖苗肥，保证了麦苗的正常生长。例如，光山县砦河人民公社的姚砦大队，集中四十五部水车，采取“多仙传道”、梯级提水的办法，把十五里以外的“月儿湖”水，倒了二十一转，送到十五丈高的岗岭上，浇地二百三十多亩。社员看到湖水爬山的情景，欢乐地唱道：“从来水向山下流，那见水往山上走？公社能把乾坤扭，竟让湖水翻山头！”
    今年入春以来，干旱发展得更严重了。大部分水库坑塘已经干涸，大河道流量减少，中小河道断流，地下水位继续降低。中共河南省委又适时地发出了“全党全民齐动手，抗旱抗到天低头，誓夺小麦大丰收”的战斗号召。一千二百万浇麦大军，巧用地上水，大挖地下水，大造提水机具，大搞工程、工具配套，千方百计地扩大灌溉面积。这次春季抗旱运动有两个特点：一是在平原地区打机井，下深泉，实行井渠灌溉双保险；二是在山岗丘陵地区修水库，打机井，大建抽水机站，实行灌溉机械化，大搞引水上山岗，向水利条件最困难的地区进军，从根本上解决山区丘陵区的水利化问题。在这次运动中，全省投入打机井的劳动力经常有一百一十多万人，已经打成机井六万九千多眼；全省山区丘陵区新建抽水机站三千六百多处，浇地四百多万亩。在这次抗旱斗争中，城市工业和其他各个方面对农业作了更大更多的支援。城市各工矿企业，一面加速赶制水利机具，一面抽调大批技术工人，深入农村，修理机器，传授技术。全党全民总动员，形成抗旱新高潮。据3月中旬统计，全省已经春灌麦田六千多万亩，其中浇两遍以上的有三千五百多万亩。目前，麦苗生长一般良好。各地公社社员正在继续不断地加强麦田管理，为夺取今年夏季更大的丰收而斗争。
    同1942年比比看
    各位代表，河南这次旱情之重，时间之长，面积之大，都大大超过了1942年的大旱灾。1942年发生旱灾五十多个县，时间五十多天，面积六千多万亩，干旱程度远没有这一次严重。可是，当时在国民党反动政府、日寇和地主恶霸的反动统治下，横征暴敛，敲诈勒索，大发灾难财，天灾加人祸，把河南人民拖进了沉重灾难的深渊，造成了赤地千里，饿殍载道、家破人亡、妻离子散的悲惨景象。就在那一年，河南有一千三百多万人离乡背井，逃荒要饭，有三百多万人被活活饿死。回忆起来，真是不寒而栗！可是，今天的情况怎样呢？从1959年
  7月以来发生干旱的达九十多个县，比1942年多四十多个县，干旱时间比1942年长二百天，受旱面积近一亿亩，占全省耕地面积80％以上，比1942年多了三千多万亩。在这样严重的情况下，全省不但没有减产，反而夺得了秋季大丰收。1959年农业总产值比大跃进的1958年还增长了21.9％，粮食总产量增长了13.75％，其他棉花、油料、烤烟等各种农作物的产量都有很大增长。整个农村呈现出一派欣欣向荣、生气勃勃的跃进景象。农民普遍歌唱着：“从前遇到干旱年，求神拜佛受熬煎；如今遇到干旱年，不求龙王不靠天。千万人民来抗旱，大旱百日保丰产；幸福不再靠天给，公社力量大无边！”我们从这些生动的鲜明的事实对比中，可以清楚地看出，旧社会是多么痛苦黑暗，新社会是多么幸福光明！1959年在河南出现的亘古未有的奇迹，雄辩地说明了人民公社制度具有无比的优越性，说明了劳动人民是历史的真正创造者。
    毛主席说：“矛盾着的对立的双方互相斗争的结果，无不在一定条件下互相转化。”“在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果”，“坏事也可以转变成为好事。”抗旱斗争的实践雄辩地证明，这是一个颠扑不破的真理。干旱是件坏事，然而，党领导人民与自然搏斗，取得了巨大成就，把它变成了好事。伟大的抗旱斗争，不仅保证了农业大丰收，推动了农村水利建设、养猪积肥、技术革新和技术革命等工作的全面大跃进，而且促进了工业特别是钢铁工业的大发展，促进了交通运输、财贸、科学、文教、卫生等各项社会主义建设事业的大发展。特别重要的是，人们的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化，敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格大大发扬，征服自然的雄心大志越来越坚定，劳动人民主宰自然的伟大时代已经开始了。
    人民公社在抗旱斗争中大显威力
    河南人民为什么能够战胜这样严重的干旱，取得这样巨大的成就呢？这是在中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，充分发挥人民公社优越性的结果。当抗旱开始的时候，党中央和毛主席就指示我们：鼓足干劲，一定要把抗旱斗争坚持到底，人定胜天，争取丰收。全省人民坚决地贯彻执行了党中央和毛主席的指示，充分发挥了人民公社的强大威力，终于战胜了“天”。人民公社在抗旱斗争中是怎样发挥强大威力的呢？
    人民公社具有工农商学兵相结合、政社合一、一大二公的特点，它可以更好地统一调动人力物力财力，进行更大规模的水利建设。抗旱以来，共兴修大中小型水库二千零一十座，塘堰坝三十二万七千多处，打井一百八十万眼，修渠一百零七万条，扩大灌溉面积二千七百万亩，相当于解放前几千年兴修灌溉面积的四倍，同时还改善灌溉面积二千八百万亩，共作土石方六十多亿立方米。水利建设上这些辉煌成就，大大增强了我们与自然灾害作斗争的能力。公社化以前，群众只能办小型的农田水利；公社化以后，群众不仅可以办中小型水利工程，而且可以举办大型水利工程。在我省去冬今春动工兴建的三十八项大型水利工程中，就有公社自办和公社联合举办的蓄水一亿立方米以上的大型水库九座。这在公社化以前是办不到的。鲁山县马楼人民公社，修了澎河水库，开了长达二十里的澎河大渠，逼使澎河水倒流，灌溉了五万五千亩土地，农业生产获得了空前大丰收。社员们歌颂道：“人民公社力量强，锁住千年老龙王；澎河倒流水利化，穷川变成鱼米乡；从此害河变利河，人民幸福乐无疆。”
    人民公社提高了社员群众的政治觉悟水平，改变了人与人之间的关系，便于组织共产主义大协作。在抗旱斗争中，生产队与生产队之间，公社与公社之间，以至县与县之间，按照互助互利的原则，组织大协作，上下游统筹兼顾，左右岸互相支援，扩大水源，合理用水。例如，南阳专区的南阳、新野、邓县、唐河四个县的十个人民公社，采取集中领导、集中劳力、集中技术力量和集中物资材料的办法，建立了一个百万亩的机井方，已经打机井二千九百眼，仅用机井就已经浇地五十五万亩，加上渠道的自流灌溉，已经高标准地完成了浇麦任务，实现了井渠灌溉双保险。再如宜阳县各人民公社，组织了二十个抽水机站工作队，抽调了五十名技术员，逐沟、逐岭、逐流域进行抽水机站的勘察规划。现在，全县动工兴建的机灌站一百八十三处，已浇地五万八千亩。南阳专区建立百万亩机井方的经验和宜阳县大建抽水机站的经验，目前，正在全省迅速推广。
    人民公社人多智谋广，并且有了社办工业，便于进行技术革新和技术革命。技术革新和技术革命运动的深入和发展，大大地加速了水利建设，有力地推动了抗旱斗争。去冬以来总共创造和推广各种水利施工工具五百五十多万件，不少工地在挖、运、装、卸、夯等工序中实现了半机械化；全省平均工效由每人每天完成土石方一点一方，提高到十一方。泌阳县华山水库，每人每天可作土方一百零八方。爆破施工有了新的创造和发展。例如临汝县寄料公社采取“连珠炮”爆破施工法开渠，组织三千六百名爆破手，在四十五里长的工地上，打了二万三千个眼，统一装药，统一点炮，一次完成二十四万土石方，占土石方任务的96％。群众高兴地说：“点炮前还未动工，点炮后就收尾工。”长葛县人民公社创造的打井利器“火箭锥”，在全省各地因地制宜推广以后，去冬以来全省已创制、改制、仿制“火箭锥”八十种一万多套。过去打一眼七、八丈深的水井，需要一个多月的时间，现在打一眼十五丈深的机井，一般只需要三、五天的时间，最快的只需要十个小时，提高效率十倍到几十倍。
    人民公社农林牧副渔和社办企业全面大发展，公共积累迅速增加，购置了大批的排灌机械和提水工具，在抗旱斗争中发挥了重大作用。1959年全省人民公社的积累，比1958年增长一倍多。公社购买水车二十二万部；购买排灌机械二十二万四千马力，比1958年增长109％。一年来，全省公社工业有了很大的发展，农村的社办工厂，经过整顿以后，现在有六万多个。1959年社办工业的总产值达到十亿元以上，比1958年增长了54.4％。各地在抗旱斗争中所需要的器材，除一部分是由国家供应外，大部分是公社工厂自己制造的。社办工厂在制造、修理水利施工工具和提水工具等方面，作出了极为显著的成绩，有力地支援了抗旱斗争。
    人民公社的公共食堂完全适应大规模集体生产的需要，在抗旱斗争中发挥了极其重要的作用。公共食堂加强了社员的集体主义思想，培养了社员的集体生活习惯，提高了社员的积极性和劳动效率；它还能够保证社员作息时间一致，保证社员吃饱、吃好、吃省；它能够解放大量的妇女劳动力，使大批妇女走上抗旱斗争和各项生产建设的最前线。如果没有公共食堂，全省经常出动二千万左右的劳动力在抗旱斗争中实行大兵团作战，是不可能的。正因为公共食堂适合公社化后大规模集体生产的需要，所以全省三十三万个公共食堂，在二百五十天的抗旱斗争中，越办越好，得到了广大社员的热烈拥护。
    在抗旱斗争的过程中，河北、吉林、上海、辽宁、黑龙江、北京、山东、湖南、湖北、广东、广西、贵州、浙江等兄弟省、市、自治区，都以崇高的共产主义风格，调拨了大批的抗旱物资支援河南人民，这也是我们取得抗旱斗争胜利的重要原因。现在我借这个机会，谨代表河南全省人民，向这些兄弟省、市、自治区致以衷心的感谢！
    乘胜前进，继续战斗
    各位代表，人民公社诞生只有一年多的历史，不仅经得起这样严重自然灾害的考验，显示出这么伟大的抵抗自然灾害和改造自然、征服自然、造福万民的威力，而且走上了更加巩固的健全发展的道路。1959年我省人民公社所举办的各项事业都有了飞跃的发展，公共积累有了很大的增长；有72％的穷队赶上了富队或一般队；90％以上的社员增加了收入，社员的生活得到进一步改善。全省农村一千二百一十个人民公社，都像钢铁一般地巩固起来了。广大农民在战胜干旱的过程中，更加坚定地把自己的命运同公社的命运更加密切地联系在一起。人民公社之所以有如此强大的威力，能够为社会生产力的发展开辟无限广阔的道路，是因为它完全符合马克思主义关于生产关系要适合生产力性质的根本原理。帝国主义者咒骂我们的总路线、大跃进、人民公社，胡说什么人民公社“垮台了”、人民公社“大失败”之类的无耻谰言；右倾机会主义分子非难人民公社“办早了”、“办糟了”、“水利化得不偿失”等等。这些荒谬论调，在河南人民伟大的抗旱斗争胜利这一铁的事实面前，都已经被彻底粉碎了。
    河南人民的抗旱斗争，已经取得了巨大的胜利。但是，争取1960年农业生产全面大丰收，还有很多艰巨的任务摆在我们面前。3月中旬以来，全省先后降了雨雪，大部分地区透墒或基本透墒，这些地区旱情暂时有所缓和。但是，部分地区仍然需要继续抗旱；就是透墒或基本透墒的地区，雨量仍然不大，没有径流，许多水库、坑塘没有蓄住水，河道流量仍然很小或者断流，而且天气渐热，蒸发量越来越大，农作物生长需要的水份越来越多。因此，我们决不能有丝毫的麻痹和松懈情绪，必须动员全省人民乘胜前进，继续战斗，有旱抗旱，无旱防旱，坚持大搞机井方，大取地下水，大搞抽水机站，大造提水机具，同时大搞养猪积肥，大搞技术革新和技术革命，大搞钢铁超产运动，组织工业及其他方面大力支援农业，千方百计夺取八千万亩夏收作物大丰收，保证把四千万亩春播作物种得又早又快又好，为今年持续的全面的更好的跃进打下坚实的基础。
    目前，我省同全国一样，政治经济形势都是很好的。我们相信，河南全省人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，就一定能够战胜前进道路上的一切困难，实现我省1960年整个国民经济的持续跃进。
    以上发言，如有不当之处，请各位代表指正。
