I wholeheartedly support the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin. After listening to the reports of the three Vice Premiers, a magnificent and vibrant picture of the Great Leap Forward emerged before us. The people of our entire country, the people of all brotherly nations, and all peace-loving and progress-seeking people of the world will be excited and applaud in celebration.

The continuous leap forward in the socialist economy not only urgently requires more construction talents who are both red and expert, but also urgently demands a rapid improvement in the people's cultural and scientific level. Education is a component part of the superstructure. When the economic foundation changes, the education undertaking must be reformed accordingly in order to better serve the foundation. In 1958, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued instructions on education work, pointing out that "the Party's education policy is to make education serve proletarian politics and to combine education with productive labor; in order to realize this policy, education work must be led by the Party." With the implementation of the Party's education policy, a high tide of education revolution was launched in our country, the bourgeois education ideology was criticized, the direction of education development was clarified, and the quality of teaching was improved, enabling our country's education undertaking to leap forward and develop greatly following the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's education thought. In the high tide of the education revolution, primary and secondary school education has achieved great results, but the teaching content has not yet been reformed in time, lagging behind the needs of the development of the situation. Thoroughly reforming primary and secondary school textbooks has become an important task in deepening the current education revolution.

In recent years, with the development of the country's politics and economy, the content of primary and secondary school textbooks has been continuously improved. Especially since 1958, much work has been done in implementing the Party's education policies, the political and ideological content has been strengthened, the integration with productive labor has become closer, and the quality has been significantly improved; at the same time, timely supply has been achieved. This work has played an active role in the great development of primary and secondary school education. However, the past improvements were not thorough, and there are still serious shortcomings of "less, slower, poorer, and more expensive."

Currently, primary and secondary school textbooks have the shortcomings of being outdated, too shallow, repetitive, and cumbersome.

Some textbook content still lacks ideological content and cannot well conduct political and ideological education for students. For example, in the high school history textbook, the society during the reign of Emperor Wen of Sui is described as a prosperous scene, saying that at that time "on the road along the Yellow River to Chang'an, carts loaded with leased grain, tribute silk, and tribute cloth were moving day and night," and several warehouses "were filled with grain, with tens of millions of stones in the largest and several million stones in the smallest," while the exploitation and oppression of peasants by Emperor Wen of Sui were not exposed. This is an example of not using a class viewpoint to analyze historical situations.

Some textbook content is outdated and backward, failing to fully reflect the ever-changing achievements of our country's production and construction and the development level of modern science and technology, and cannot keep up with the needs of socialist construction. For example, the basic content of mathematics textbooks is still at the level of the 17th and 18th centuries. Among them, the geometry part is basically the geometric system of Euclid from 2,000 years ago; some content of physics and chemistry textbooks is still at the level of the 19th century, and modern production practices and the latest scientific and technological achievements such as radio, atomic energy, and rare elements are either discussed too little or not at all. Of course, we do not advocate abandoning all ancient knowledge. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Anything that we can use today should be absorbed." However, staying at the level of previous centuries, being satisfied with the old, and not promptly transforming the old system and adding new content based on the reality of socialist economic development and the new achievements of science and technology would be wrong. The result of doing so will inevitably lead to detachment from production and reality.

Some textbook content is too shallow, lagging behind the development of students' intelligence. For example, in elementary school arithmetic, the first semester of the first grade only teaches addition and subtraction within 20. In fact, first-grade students can already count to hundreds. Another example is elementary school language arts in the lower grades, which does not make full use of the Pinyin alphabet to accelerate the process of literacy and reading, resulting in too little literacy, too shallow texts, only more than 1,300 characters recognized in two years, and written composition only starting in the third grade.

Some textbook content is repetitive and cumbersome. For example, history has three cycles from elementary school to high school. Another example is the integer part of elementary school arithmetic, which has seven cycles; moreover, some four-operation problems are easy to solve with algebra, but are limited to being solved with difficult arithmetic methods, thus the learning time for arithmetic is dragged on for a long time, lasting seven years from elementary school to junior high school. In order to make it easier for students to accept and master, it is of course necessary to take a certain cycle in the teaching of certain knowledge, but too many cycles, stacking beds on top of each other, will cause waste due to repetition. Examples of cumbersome textbook content include mathematical and physical theorems or laws, some of which are relatively simple and do not need to be explained much, but are explained in great detail, which also causes waste.

If the shortcomings of being outdated, too shallow, repetitive, and cumbersome are removed, a lot of teaching time can be saved. For example, arithmetic originally had to be learned for seven years in primary and secondary schools. It is estimated that it can be completed in about four years in elementary school alone. Another example is Chinese, mathematics, history, geography, physics, chemistry, and biology in middle schools. According to preliminary surveys, a total of more than 1,000 class hours can be saved.

The fundamental reason for the above shortcomings is that remnants of bourgeois education ideology are at work in the editing of textbooks. First of all, education is viewed in isolation, education for the sake of education, and there is no full recognition that the goal of the proletariat in running education is to cultivate people to have communist awareness and moral character, and to have a high level of cultural and scientific knowledge to engage in building a great socialist and communist society. Our teaching materials must be based on this goal, resolutely implement the Party's education policy, closely integrate with politics and production, in order to rapidly improve the people's political awareness and cultural and scientific level. Affected by the bourgeois education ideology, the understanding of this goal becomes blurred, thus producing shortcomings such as neglecting politics, insufficient integration with production and practice. Furthermore, holding on to the bourgeois idea of education for the sake of education, unable to firmly grasp the goal of the proletariat in running education, the view of knowledge will one-sidedly emphasize book knowledge, believing that the more book knowledge the better, regardless of whether it is outdated or backward, regardless of whether it is really needed, and regardless of importance or triviality, all are regarded as "basic knowledge" and taught to students all at once, thus causing the textbook content to be outdated and cumbersome, and not fully in line with reality.

In terms of teaching principles, the bourgeois education ideology has an incorrect understanding of children's ability to accept, believing that the development of students' intelligence is only determined by physiological reasons, and has nothing to do with the development of the entire society. They do not understand that under the socialist system and in the context of the rapid development of modern science and technology, the intelligence of our students has been rapidly developed and the ideological field has been continuously expanded. Therefore, the students' ability to accept is underestimated. They believe that it is not easy for students to accept this or that, and after explaining it, they are still afraid that the students will not be able to digest it, so they explain it again and again. This causes the textbook content to be repetitive and too shallow.

The bourgeois education ideology is completely opposed to the proletarian education ideology. Although it is only a remnant, it is the root cause of "less, slower, poorer, and more expensive," and it often plays a role in people's minds, which is extremely harmful to the people's education undertaking. Therefore, we must resolutely launch a class struggle in the field of education ideology, eliminate the bourgeois education ideology, break superstitions, liberate our minds, and give play to the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, so that we can edit brand-new textbooks worthy of our great era.

Thorough Textbook Reform Must Be Guided by Mao Zedong Thought

We deeply realize that in order to thoroughly reform the content of textbooks, implement the spirit of the Party's general line, and achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, we must put politics in command and be guided by Mao Zedong Thought. The Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practices of the Chinese revolution and construction, is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all our revolutionary work. Editing textbooks requires correctly implementing the Party's policies, and clearly recognizing that our goal is to train the younger generation to become laborers with socialist awareness and culture. This goal points out the direction for editing textbooks. Putting politics in command requires first and foremost firmly grasping this direction. We must never simply regard textbooks as a collection of knowledge, let alone regard the editing of textbooks as purely technical work, otherwise we will lose our way. As Chairman Mao said, "Without a correct political viewpoint, it is as if there is no soul."

Putting politics in command requires using the proletarian stand, viewpoint, and method to expound social and natural phenomena. Only in this way can we overcome the metaphysical viewpoints in textbooks and strengthen the political and ideological content of textbooks. Such textbooks will help students recognize the road forward, consciously struggle against various bourgeois ideas, and help cultivate their dialectical materialist worldview and communist moral character.

At the same time, we realize that in order to implement the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical results in the content of textbooks, we must also pay attention to the following points:

1.  In order to meet the needs of our country's socialist economic construction, the content of textbooks should increase the knowledge of modern production needs and the latest science and technology. Modern science and technology are developing rapidly. Our era has entered the era of space flight. Our country's science and technology must catch up with the advanced level of the world. What others have, we must have, and what others do not have, we must also have. Therefore, we must let our younger generation master the latest scientific and technological knowledge. In the primary and secondary school education stage, we should lay a solid foundation for students to continue their studies. At the same time, scientific and technological knowledge is also urgently needed for technological innovation and technological revolution to accelerate our country's socialist construction. Students who master scientific and technological knowledge are more conducive to continuing their studies and engaging in various productive labor. For example, knowledge about atomic energy, semiconductors, rare elements, as well as calculus, radio, meteorology, hydrology, etc., can be considered to be appropriately taught to students in relevant disciplines.

People often think that textbooks should be stabilized. We believe that stability is needed, but it is relative. Society is constantly moving forward. When the social economic base changes, education, as the superstructure, must change accordingly. The development of science and technology is also endless. Knowledge that is considered profound at a certain period will become common knowledge that everyone knows after a while. Therefore, unchanging textbooks are impossible. Stability can only be relative. Constantly revising or adapting with the development of the objective situation is absolute.

2.  There should be sufficient estimation of the development of our students' intelligence, and the content of textbooks must be appropriately improved. Experiments in many schools have proved that students' ability to accept is much higher than we previously estimated. For example, the content originally scheduled for the first semester of the first grade of elementary school Chinese textbooks was completed in only five weeks by Beiguan Elementary School in Heishan County, Liaoning Province. There are many such examples, and I will not say more. Facts fully prove that students can fully accept the appropriate improvement of textbook content. If the content of textbooks is too shallow, it cannot satisfy students' desire for knowledge, nor can it give play to students' enthusiasm. Appropriately improving the content of textbooks can not only learn more and faster, but also learn better.

3.  The outdated, repetitive, and cumbersome parts in textbooks must be removed. The more human knowledge accumulates, the more the new always surpasses the old. In order not to increase the burden on students, useless old knowledge must be removed in order to increase useful new knowledge. For example, physics should delete unnecessary or secondary knowledge from classical physics and increase knowledge of modern physics. In order to avoid repetition, unnecessary cycles should also be removed. For example, history should remove the existing three cycles. Another example is the integer part of elementary school arithmetic, the existing seven cycles should also be appropriately reduced. In this way, the content of textbooks will truly be the essence of various knowledge, so that students can learn more necessary knowledge in less time.

4.  We must resolutely break the framework of the old textbook system. Those old frameworks do not conform to the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical results, and are obstacles to reforming textbooks, which must be broken. Revolution means breaking the old framework. For example, Euclid's geometric system must be broken, of course, the parts that are still useful today must still be taught. Another example is elementary school arithmetic, in the past, the four operations and algebra were completely separated, but now we can break this framework and introduce algebra into arithmetic, so that we can learn faster and more. Another example is geography, in the past, textbooks maintained their respective disciplinary systems of physical geography and economic geography, but this framework should be broken. According to the needs of teaching, physical geography knowledge and economic geography knowledge should be combined and taught. In this way, a new disciplinary system can be established according to the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical results. We still lack experience in establishing a new disciplinary system, and we hope that all localities will give full play to their revolutionary energy and actively create experience.

We believe that by removing the shortcomings of "less, slower, poorer, and more expensive" in existing textbooks, editing new textbooks according to the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical results, and taking appropriate measures in other aspects, primary and secondary school education can appropriately shorten the number of years, appropriately improve the level, appropriately increase labor, and achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.

The reform of textbooks, like other undertakings, must be under the leadership of the Party, resolutely follow the mass line, and implement the principle of walking on two legs. Our country is a large country with a population of 650 million and a vast territory, and the situation varies from place to place. Therefore, under the unity of consistent goals and consistent principles, a variety of textbooks can be flexibly compiled. The Central Ministry of Education can compile them, and local governments should also compile them. In fact, since 1958, the Party's policy of walking on two legs has been implemented in the editing of textbooks, and great results have been achieved. Many new teaching materials have been compiled in various places, and a lot of good experience has been accumulated. Generally speaking, these teaching materials attach importance to combining with politics, combining with production, and combining with reality. Some have broken the outdated disciplinary system and shortened teaching time; some have increased the new achievements of modern science and technology and strengthened experiments and internships; some have reduced cycles and avoided repetition. The good experience of local textbook editing will undoubtedly greatly promote the work of reforming textbooks. In the future, various places will create more experience in this area, compile better teaching materials, and achieve greater results.

Thoroughly reforming textbooks is an arduous and glorious task. Under the leadership of the Party, giving full play to the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses, we are fully confident that we can complete this task in a relatively short period of time.

专栏：

    中小学教科书必须改革
    叶圣陶代表的发言
    我衷心拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告。听了三位副总理的报告，一幅宏伟壮丽龙骧虎步的大跃进的生动图景涌现在我们面前。我全国人民、各个兄弟国家的人民以及全世界爱好和平追求进步的人民，全都会心情激动，鼓掌称庆。
    社会主义经济的连续跃进，不但迫切需要更多的又红又专的建设人材，而且迫切要求迅速提高人民的文化科学水平。教育是上层建筑的一个构成部分，经济基础改变了，教育事业必须相应地改革，才能很好地为基础服务。1958年党中央和国务院就发布了关于教育工作的指示，指出“党的教育工作方针，是使教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合；为了实现这个方针，教育工作必须由党来领导”。随着党的教育工作方针的贯彻执行，我国掀起了教育革命的高潮，批判了资产阶级教育思想，明确了教育发展的方向，提高了教学的质量，使我国的教育事业遵循着马克思列宁主义的根本原则和毛主席的教育思想飞跃前进、大大地发展。在教育革命的高潮中，中小学教育取得了巨大的成绩，但是教学内容还没来得及进行改革，落后于形势发展的需要。对中小学教科书进行彻底的改革，就成为当前深入教育革命的一项重要任务。
    几年以来，随着国家政治经济的发展，中小学教科书的内容也不断有所改进，特别是1958年以来，在贯彻党的教育方针政策方面做了不少工作，政治思想性加强了，与生产劳动结合得比较密切了，质量显著提高了；同时又做到了及时供应。这些工作，对中小学教育的大发展起了积极的作用。但是过去的改进是不彻底的，还存在着严重的少慢差费的情况。
    目前中小学教科书中有陈旧、偏浅、重复、繁琐的缺点
    有些教科书的内容思想性还差，不能很好地向学生进行政治思想教育。如高中历史课本中把隋文帝时期的社会描写成一片繁荣景象，说当时“黄河两岸通往长安的大道上，租粟、调绢、调布的车子，一辆接着一辆地昼夜不停”，几处仓库“都装满了粮食，多的上千万石，少的也有几百万石”，而对于隋文帝对农民的剥削和压榨却没有揭露。这就是对历史情况没有运用阶级观点来分析的例子。
    有些教科书的内容陈腐落后，没有充分反映我国生产建设日新月异的成就和现代科学技术的发展水平，赶不上社会主义建设的需要。例如数学教材的基本内容还停留在十七八世纪的水平，其中几何部分，基本上还是两千年前欧几里得的几何体系；物理、化学教材的某些内容还停留在十九世纪的水平，对现代生产的实际和最新的科学技术成就如无线电、原子能、稀有元素等等，或者讲得太少，或者根本没有讲。当然，我们并不主张抛弃一切古代的知识，毛主席早已指出：“凡属我们今天用得着的东西，都应该吸收”。但是，停留在前几世纪的水平，以旧的东西为满足，不根据社会主义经济发展的实际和科学技术的新成就及时改造旧的体系，增加新的内容，那就是错误的了。这样做的结果，必然导致脱离生产，脱离实际。
    有些教科书的内容偏浅，落后于学生智力的发展。例如小学算术，一年级上学期只教二十以内的加减，实际上小学一年级学生已经能够数到几百了。又如小学低年级语文，没有充分利用拼音字母来加快识字和阅读的进程，以致识字偏少，课文偏浅，两年内只识一千三百多字，三年级才开始书面作文。
    有些教科书的内容重复、繁琐。例如历史，从小学到高中有三个循环。又如小学算术的整数部分，有七个循环；而且，有些四则难题用代数来解就很容易，却限于用繁难的算术方法来解，因而算术的学习时间拖得很长，从小学到初中达七年之久。为了使学生易于接受和便于掌握，某些知识的讲授采取一定的循环固然是必要的，但是循环过多，迭床架屋，就因重复而造成浪费。教材内容繁琐的例子，如数学和物理的定理或定律，有些比较简单，根本不必多讲，可是都讲得很详细，这也造成浪费。
    如果把陈旧、偏浅、重复、繁琐的缺点去掉，就可以节省大量的教学时间。例如算术，原来要在中小学学七年，据估计，只要在小学学四年左右就可以学完了。又如中学的语文、数学、历史、地理、物理、化学、生物，据初步调查，一共可以节约一千多课时。
    产生上述这些缺点的根本原因是在教科书的编辑工作中，资产阶级教育思想的残余在那里作祟。首先是把教育孤立起来看，为教育而教育，没有完全认识到无产阶级办教育的目标是培养人民使具有共产主义的觉悟和道德品质，具有高度的文化科学知识，从事建设伟大的社会主义、共产主义社会。我们的教材必须根据这个目标，坚决贯彻党的教育方针，密切结合政治、结合生产，以迅速提高人民的政治觉悟和文化科学水平。受了资产阶级教育思想的影响，对于这个目标的认识就模糊了，因而产生了忽视政治、结合生产和实际不够的缺点。再说，抱着资产阶级为教育而教育的思想，不能紧紧掌握无产阶级办教育的目标，对知识的看法就会片面地强调书本知识，认为书本知识越多越好，不问是否陈旧落后，不问是否确属需要，也不分轻重巨细，都看做“基本知识”，一股脑儿教给学生，因而造成教科书内容的陈旧繁琐，不尽切合实际。
    在教学原则方面，资产阶级教育思想对儿童的接受能力有不正确的认识，认为学生智力的发展只决定于生理的原因，而与整个社会的发展无关。不了解在社会主义制度下，在现代科学技术飞跃发展的情况下，我国学生的智力已经得到迅速发展，思想领域不断扩大，因而把学生的接受能力估计过低，认为学生这样也不容易接受，那样也不容易接受，讲了之后，还怕学生消化不了，讲了一遍又是一遍。这就造成教科书内容的重复、偏浅。
    资产阶级教育思想是与无产阶级教育思想截然对立的，虽说只是残余，却正是少慢差费的根本原因，而且常常在人们的头脑里起作用，对人民的教育事业有极大的危害性。因此，必须坚决展开一场教育思想领域中的阶级斗争，肃清资产阶级教育思想，破除迷信，解放思想，发挥敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，这才能编辑出同我们这个伟大时代相称的崭新的教科书来。
    彻底改革教科书必须以毛泽东思想为指导
    我们深刻地体会到，要彻底改革教科书的内容，贯彻党的总路线的精神，实现多快好省，必须政治挂帅，以毛泽东思想为指导。马克思列宁主义普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想是我们一切革命工作取得胜利的根本保证。编辑教科书，要正确贯彻党的方针政策，要明确认识我们的目标是把青年一代培养成为有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者。这个目标指明了编辑教科书的方向。政治挂帅首先要紧紧地掌握这个方向。决不能把教科书简单地看成知识的汇集，更不能把教科书的编辑工作看成纯粹的技术工作，否则就会迷失方向，正如毛主席所说，“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”。
    政治挂帅必须用无产阶级的立场、观点、方法来阐述社会现象和自然现象。这才能克服教科书的形而上学的观点，加强教科书的政治思想性。这样的教科书才有利于学生认清前进的道路，能同各种资产阶级思想自觉地进行斗争，才有利于培养他们的辩证唯物主义的世界观和共产主义的道德品质。
    同时，我们体会到，要在教科书内容中贯彻多快好省的精神，还必须注意以下几点：
    一、为了满足我国社会主义经济建设的需要，教科书的内容要增加现代生产需要的和最新科学技术的知识。现代科学技术飞跃发展，我们的时代已经进入宇宙飞行时代，我国的科学技术要迎头赶上世界的先进水平，别人有的，我们要有，别人没有的，我们也要有。因此，必须让我们的青年一代掌握最新的科学技术知识，在中小学教育阶段，就应当为学生继续深造打好坚实的基础。同时，科学技术知识又是进行技术革新和技术革命以加速我国社会主义建设所迫切需要的。学生掌握了科学技术知识，就更有利于继续深造和从事各项生产劳动。如有关原子能、半导体、稀有元素以及微分、积分、无线电、气象、水文等知识，都可以考虑在有关学科中适当地教给学生。
    人们常常认为教科书应该稳定下来。我们认为稳定是需要的，然而是相对的。社会是不断向前发展的，当社会经济基础改变了的时候，作为上层建筑的教育必须相应地改变。科学技术的发展也是没有止境的，某一时期认为高深的知识，过些时候就成为人人皆知的普通常识了。因此，一成不变的教科书是不可能有的，稳定只能是相对的，随着客观形势的发展而不断修订或改编，那倒是绝对的。
    二、对我国学生智力的发展应该有足够的估计，教科书的内容必须适当提高。许多学校的实验证明，学生的接受能力远比我们先前估计的为高。例如小学语文课本第一册原定学习一个学期的内容，辽宁省黑山县北关小学只用五个星期就学完了。这样的例子很多，我不再多说。事实充分证明，适当提高教科书的内容，学生是完全可以接受的。教科书的内容过浅，既不能满足学生的求知欲，也不能发挥学生的积极性。适当提高教科书的内容，不但可以学得多些快些，而且可以学得好些。
    三、教科书中陈旧、重复、繁琐的部分必须去掉。人类知识越积累越多，新的总是超过旧的。为不加重学生的负担，要去掉无用的旧知识，才能增加有用的新知识。例如物理学应该从古典物理学中删简不必要的或次要的知识，增加近代物理学的知识。为了避免重复，不必要的循环也应该去掉。例如历史，应该去掉现有的三个循环。又如小学算术的整数部分，现有的七个循环也应该适当减少。这样，教科书的内容才真正是各门知识的精华，才能使学生花较少的时间学到较多的必需的知识。
    四、要坚决打破教科书旧体系的框框。那些旧框框不符合多快好省的精神，是改革教科书的障碍物，非打破不可。革命就是要打破旧框框。例如欧几里得的几何体系必须打破，当然，至今还有用的部分还是要教的。又如小学算术，过去是四则和代数截然分开，现在可以打破这个框框，在算术中引入代数，这就可以学得快些多些。又如地理，过去课本中保持着自然地理经济地理各自的学科体系，应该打破这个框框。按照教学的需要，把自然地理知识和经济地理知识结合起来教。这样就可以根据多快好省的精神建立新的学科体系。建立新的学科体系，我们还缺乏经验，希望各地充分发挥革命干劲，积极创造经验。
    我们相信，去掉现有教科书中少慢差费的情况，根据多快好省的精神编辑新的教科书，同时其他方面也采取适当的措施，那么中小学教育就可以适当地缩短年限，适当地提高程度，适当地增加劳动，做到多快好省。
    教科书的改革工作同其他事业一样，必须在党的领导下，坚决走群众路线，贯彻两条腿走路的方针。我国是一个拥有六亿五千万人口的大国，幅员广大，各地情况不同，因此，在目标一致方针一致的统一性下，可以灵活性地编出多种多样的教科书来。中央教育部可以编，地方也应该编。事实上，从1958年以来，党的两条腿走路的方针在教科书的编辑工作中已经贯彻，取得了很大的成果。各地编出了不少新教材，积累了不少好经验。这些教材，一般说来，都重视结合政治，结合生产，结合实际。有的打破了陈旧的学科体系，缩短了教学时间；有的增加了近代科学技术的新成就，加强了实验实习；有的减少了循环，避免了重复。地方编辑教材的好经验，对改革教科书的工作无疑会起很大的推进作用。今后各地还会在这一方面创造更多的经验，编出更好的教材，取得更大的成绩。
    彻底改革教科书是一项艰巨而光荣的任务。在党的领导下，充分发挥群众的创造性和积极性，我们完全有信心在较短的时间内完成这个任务。
