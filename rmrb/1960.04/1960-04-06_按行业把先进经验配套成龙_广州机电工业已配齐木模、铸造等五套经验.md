According to Guangzhou Daily, the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industries is actively defining, summarizing, supporting, and promoting the advanced experiences emerging from the "Four Modernizations" (mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation) movement. Currently, five relatively complete sets of experiences in wood moulding, casting, riveting and welding, fitter work, and electrical machinery have been equipped.

The production capacity of Guangzhou's mechanical and electrical industries has always been unbalanced, with eight weak links including in-plant transportation, wood moulding, casting, riveting and welding, forging, fitter work, electrical machinery, and heat treatment. At the beginning of the "Four Modernizations" movement, the Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industries and various district bureaus clearly pointed out the focus of the "Four Modernizations" movement to the masses, mobilizing them to focus on the above eight key areas. In order to enable these weak types of work (industries) to quickly create complete sets of experience, the mechanical and electrical industrial sub-bureaus of each district carried out industry-based planning to mobilize the masses to tackle key problems in a planned and led manner. For keys that were particularly difficult to break through, forces were concentrated to encircle and suppress them.

After more than a month of tackling key problems, advanced experiences bloomed everywhere. In order to summarize these scattered experiences into systematic, complete, and complete sets of advanced experiences, the Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industries specially organized a group of technicians to appraise, select, define, summarize, and support these advanced experiences. At present, some advanced experiences in wood moulding, casting, riveting and welding, fitter work, electrical machinery, and other types of work (industries) have been selected, and five relatively complete sets of experiences have been matched according to the working procedures, compiled and printed, and distributed to various factories for promotion and application. In the five sets of advanced experience that have been matched, the efficiency of each item can be increased several times or even dozens of times compared with the original manual operation.

Before the "Four Modernizations" movement, the wood mould machinery in this city was almost a blank slate. After more than ten days of hard work, the Guangzhou Machine Wood Mould Factory produced more than forty general-purpose wood mould machines and more than twenty special-purpose wood moulds, all of which were highly efficient. After appraisal by the Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industries, nine kinds of wood mould machines from this factory and advanced mechanical equipment from Flying Leap Wood Mould Factory and other factories, totaling twenty-one items, were selected to form a complete set of wood mould machinery including scribing, sawing, planing, milling, grinding, and drilling processes. According to calculations by the South District Mechanical and Electrical Industry Sub-bureau, the production capacity of wood moulds can be increased three times after all these equipments are promoted. In terms of riveting and welding, the complete set of experience contains twenty-two items; there are already five sets of advanced experience in fitter work and electrical machinery. After these experiences are widely promoted in the mechanical and electrical industries, the unbalanced state of production capacity of Guangzhou's mechanical and electrical industries will be greatly changed, thereby pushing the production of mechanical and electrical industries to a new stage.

    按行业把先进经验配套成龙
    广州机电工业已配齐木模、铸造等五套经验
    据广州日报消息　广州市机电工业局对“四化”（机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化）运动中涌现出来的先进经验，积极进行定型、总结、配套、推广。目前，已配齐木模、铸造、铆焊、钳工、电机等五套较完整的经验。
    广州市机电工业的生产能力一向不平衡，存在着厂内运输、木模、铸造、铆焊、锻压、钳工、电机、热处理等八个薄弱环节。“四化”运动一开始，市机电工业局和各区分局即明确向群众指出“四化”运动的重点，发动群众围攻以上八个关键。为了使这些薄弱工种（行业）迅速创造出成套的经验，各区机电工业分局都按行业进行规划，做到有计划、有领导地发动群众攻关。对特别难以攻破的关键，则集中力量加以围攻。
    经过一个多月来的攻关战斗，先进经验繁花盛开。为了将这些分散的经验总结成系统的、完整的、成套的先进经验，市机电工业局专门组织了一批技术人员对这些先进经验进行鉴定、选型、定型、总结、配套。现在已选定了木模、铸造、铆焊、钳工、电机等工种（行业）的一些先进经验，按工序配成五套较完整的经验，编印成册，发往各厂推广运用。在配成的五套先进经验中，每一项的效率比原来手工操作都可提高几倍甚至几十倍。
    “四化”运动以前，这个市的木模机械几乎是空白点。广州机器木模厂经过十几天的努力，制成了四十多台通用木模机械和二十多台专用木模，效率都很高。经市机电工业局鉴定，选出了这个厂九种木模机械和飞跃木模厂等工厂的先进机械设备共二十一项，组成了包括划线、锯、刨、铣、磨、钻工序的全套木模机械。据南区机电工业分局计算，这些设备全部推广后，木模的生产能力可提高三倍。在铆焊方面，成套经验的内容有二十二个项目；钳工和电机方面已有五套先进经验。这些经验在机电工业中普遍推广后，将大大改变广州市机电工业生产能力不平衡的状况，从而将机电工业生产推向一个新的阶段。
