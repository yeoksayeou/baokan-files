Strengthen Forest Fire Prevention Work
By a staff commentator of this newspaper

    Forest fire prevention is a major task at present, and the leading organs in all mountainous and forest areas should quickly take up this matter.
    Since 1958, vast mountainous and forest areas across the country have continuously carried out vigorous campaigns to eliminate forest fires. In this movement, Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over forest fire prevention, and the broad masses have displayed the same vigor as in overcoming floods and droughts, strictly guarding against fire sources and vigorously building forest fire prevention facilities. In the past two years, about six hundred counties and thousands of communes and forest farms across the country have basically curbed the scourge of forest fires, which is a great achievement. However, since the spring of this year, forest fires have occurred again in some places, with Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Fujian being the most severely affected. This issue should arouse high vigilance. Not only should areas where forest fires have occurred pay attention, but also areas that have already become “forest fire-free zones” should pay attention as well. Because the elimination of fires does not mean the elimination of all possible natural and human factors that can cause disasters, and fire can occur at any time with a slight lapse in vigilance.
    Forests are the valuable property of the country and the people. We mobilize the masses to plant trees every year in order to expand China's forest area and increase the resources of timber forests, economic forests, and fuel wood forests necessary for national economic construction and people's lives. However, if we only plant trees without seriously protecting them, a mountain fire can turn millions of acres of forest into ashes, which is very detrimental to expanding the country's forest resources. Our country's agricultural economy has entered a new period of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. The position and significance of forestry construction are even greater, and forest protection must be firmly grasped as a regular task in forestry production.
    Fire is the great enemy of forests, but it can be prevented and quickly extinguished. All localities should study the laws of forest fires, find out the main sources of fire in their area, and then take precautions according to the hazards, doing forest protection work effectively. The key to preventing forest fires lies in strengthening the leadership of Party committees at all levels, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, and fully mobilizing the masses. Seventy percent of the fires this spring were caused by agricultural production activities, with fires caused by burning wasteland being the most numerous. Therefore, in the leadership of agricultural production, it is necessary to combine production with fire prevention and resolutely implement safe production measures. Past lessons tell us that forest fires in some mountainous, densely forested, inaccessible, and sparsely populated areas are often not easily extinguished in time, leading to widespread disasters. This is a weak link, and for fire prevention work in these areas, it is particularly necessary to strengthen specific leadership and take effective measures. Provinces, counties, communes, and forest farms bordering each other should strengthen cooperation, work closely together, and strictly guard against fire hazards.
    At present, many areas are still experiencing drought, and the use of fire for wasteland burning, fertilizer burning, and sideline production in mountainous areas may increase. Whether in the south or the north, it is necessary to seize the opportunity during agricultural production to make arrangements for forest fire prevention work and take thorough safe production measures. Doing this work well is of great significance for accelerating the greening of the country, ensuring spring plowing production, and guaranteeing the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

    加强护林防火工作
    本报评论员
    护林防火是当前一件大事，一切山区、林区的领导机关应当迅速把这件事抓起来。
    1958年以来，全国广大的山区、林区持续开展了声势浩大的无森林火灾运动。在这个运动中，各级党委加强了对护林防火的领导，广大群众拿出像战胜水旱灾害一样的干劲，严防火源，大力建设森林防火设施。两年以来，全国约有六百多个县和数以千计的公社和林场基本上制止了森林火灾的为害，这个成绩是很大的。但是，今年春季以来，有些地方又发生了森林火灾，其中以云南、广东、广西、贵州和福建等地较为严重。这个问题应当引起高度的警惕。不但发生了森林火灾的地区要注意，就是已经成为“无森林火灾区”的地区也要同样注意。因为消灭了火灾，不等于消灭了一切可能引起灾患的自然因素和人为因素，稍有麻痹大意，火灾随时都可能发生。
    森林是国家和人民的宝贵财产。我们年年发动群众植树造林，为的是扩大我国的森林面积，增加国家经济建设和人民生活所必需的用材林、经济林和薪炭林的资源。但是，如果光是造林而不认真护林，一场山火就可能把千百万亩森林化为灰烬，这对于扩大国家的森林资源是很不利的。我们国家的农业经济已经进入了农林牧副渔全面大发展的新时期，林业建设的地位和意义更加重大了，必须把护林作为林业生产上的一项经常性的工作紧紧地抓起来。
    火灾是森林的大敌，但它是可以防止和迅速扑灭的。各地应当研究森林火灾的规律，弄清本地的主要火源，然后因害设防，有的放矢，把护林工作做在关节上。制止森林火灾的关键，在于加强各级党委的领导、坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众。今春的火灾十分之七是农业生产用火引起的，其中烧荒引起的火灾最多。因此，在农业生产的领导中，必须把生产和防火结合起来，坚决贯彻执行安全生产措施。历来的教训告诉我们，一些山高林密、交通不便、人烟稀少的地区，发生森林火灾，往往不易及时扑灭，以致蔓延成灾。这是一个薄弱环节，对于这类地区的防火工作，特别需要加强具体领导，采取有力措施。省与省、县与县、公社与公社、林场与林场交界的地方，应当加强协作，密切配合，严防火灾为害。
    目前不少地区仍然干旱，山区烧荒、烧肥、副业生产用火还可能增加。不论南方或北方，都应当在农业生产中抓紧布置护林防火工作，采取周密的安全生产措施。做好这项工作，对于加速绿化事业，保障春耕生产，保证农林牧副渔各业全面大发展，都有重大的意义。
