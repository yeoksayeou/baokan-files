Calculating Reservoir Capacity

We must have a bottom line in our minds, how much water does our commune actually control! If we release water whenever we want, draining the reservoir, it will be difficult when the autumn drought arrives. Similarly, it is unnecessary to let crops suffer from drought in the summer, while the reservoir stores too much water in the autumn. What if we encounter a continuous rainy autumn, the ground is saturated, and the reservoir cannot store more water? Therefore, the rational discharge of a reservoir and the rational irrigation and drainage of nearby farmland is a very significant issue. Such problems certainly need mathematics to help solve them. Although there are many other factors, we must perform calculations and make arrangements based on specific circumstances. But no matter how we arrange it, one thing is certain: we must know how much water is in the reservoir. Only by accurately grasping the amount of water from one water level to another can we use it rationally. We plan to introduce the calculation methods of reservoir capacity in two installments. This time, we will introduce the estimation method of the volume of large reservoirs with topographic maps, and next time we will introduce the estimation method of small reservoirs or ponds.

Assume that there is a topographic map with contour lines before the reservoir was built (Figure 1). The elevation difference is h. A circle shown on the map is actually the water surface at a certain elevation in the reservoir. We estimate the volume between two such planes. The distance between these two planes is the elevation difference h. Let A and B represent the areas enclosed by the upper and lower contour circles respectively. The volume we seek is obviously no larger than the area of the lower circle multiplied by the elevation difference, i.e., Ah, and obviously no smaller than the area of the upper circle multiplied by the elevation difference, i.e., Bh. That is, the area is between Ah and Bh. We use their average value A+B/2 * h to represent the volume of a slice between these two elevations. This can also be expressed as the average cross-sectional area multiplied by the height equals the volume between the two elevations. By calculating each slice, we can know how much water there is between that elevation and that elevation, and adding them up gives the total storage capacity.

Generally speaking, this method can meet objective needs, but the estimated storage capacity may be a bit high. We will now introduce another method commonly used in mineral deposit estimation (this method is called the Bauman method, which he discovered when estimating the mineral deposits of the Donbass coal mine). This method is more precise than the previous method. The formula is:

(1/2(A+B) - 1/6T)h

And T is the area of the figure drawn according to the following method (Figure 2).

Starting from the high point O, draw a ray OP. The length of this ray between A and B on the map is l. Draw another figure, take a point O', and take O'P' = ? in the same direction as OP. When P goes around A, P' also gets a figure. The area of this figure is T. We also use T(A, B) to represent it, because it depends on the two sections A and B (the derivation of this method requires a longer exposition, or requires calculus, so it is omitted).

Considering three consecutive sections, the first method can also be improved. If we know that the areas of the three sections are A, B, and C, we can regard 1/2(A+B+C) as the average area, but since the B surface is in the middle, we can also regard the B surface as the average area. These two numbers are not necessarily equal. We average them again, that is, take 1/2(1/3(A+B+C) + B) = 1/6(A+4B+C) as the average area and multiply it by the height 2h. In this way, the volume of two slices together is 1/3(A+4B+C)h. This method is called the Sobolevsky method, or Simpson's rule. The Bauman method and the Sobolevsky method are not easy to compare. Sometimes this one is more precise, and sometimes that one is more precise, but the following formula is more precise than both of these methods:

h[1/3(A+4B+C) - 2/15(T(A, B) + T(B, C)) + 1/15T(A, C)]

The method of calculating reservoirs can not only be used to calculate reservoirs, but of course can also be used to estimate mineral deposits, calculate earthwork, etc. We thank the workers engaged in estimating mineral deposits for introducing us to the Bauman method, and now we reciprocate their kindness with the fourth method for them to try and refer to.

    数学的用场

    算水库容积
    咱们必须要心中有个底，咱们的公社究竟掌握了多少水！如果要水就放，把水库放枯了，到了秋旱时节就不好办。同样，在夏天使农作物干渴了，而秋天水库存水太多，那也大可不必，如果再遇上个阴雨绵绵的秋天，地上有水，库里又不能再蓄水，怎办？因此一个水库的合理泄放，和它附近农田的合理排灌，就是一个极有意义的问题。这样的问题当然也要用到数学来帮助解决，虽然其他因素很多，我们必须根据具体情况，进行计算，进行安排，但不管怎样安排，有一点是肯定要知道的，就是水库里有多少水。从一水位到另一水位有多少水，只有准确地掌握了水量，才有可能合理使用。我们准备分两次来介绍水库容量的计算方法。这次介绍有地形图的大水库的容积估算法，下次将介绍小水库或池塘的容积估算法。
    假定没有修水库前有一幅画了等高线的地形图（图一），高程差是h，地图上所表示的一圈，实际上便是水库中一定高程的水面，我们来估算两个这样平面之间的体积，这两平面之间的距离便是高程差h，我们以A，B各代表上下两个等高线圈所包有的面积，所求的体积显然不大于下圈面积乘以高程差，即Ah，也显然不小于上圈面积乘以高程差，即Bh，也就是面积在Ah与Bh之间，我们用它们的平均值A+B/2h来代表这两个高程间的一片体积，这也可以讲成为平均截面积乘上高就等于两高程间的体积，一片一片地算出来，便可以知道从那一个高程和那一个高程之间有多少水，加起来便得总存水量。
    这个方法，一般说来可以符合客观需要的，但估计出来的蓄水量可能偏高了一些，我们现在再介绍一个矿藏量估算上常用的方法（这个方法叫做巴乌曼法，是他估算顿巴斯煤矿矿藏量时所发现的），这方法比以上的方法更精密些，公式是：
     （1/2（A+B）-1/6T）h
    而T是根据以下方法所画出的图形的面积（图二）
    从制高点O出发，作射线OP，这射线在地图上A，B之间的长度是l，另作一图，取一点O’，并与OP同方向取O’P’＝?，当P沿着A走一圈时，P’也得一图形，这图形的面积就是T。这个面积我们也用T（A，B）来表示它，因为依赖于二截面A与B（这个方法的推导要用较长的篇幅，或要用微积分，因此从略）。
    用连续三个截面考虑，第一法还可以改进，如果知道三个截面的面积是A，B，C，我们可以把1/2（A＋B＋C）看成为平均面积，但由于B面居中，也可以把B面看为平均面积，这两个数目不一定相等，我们再平均一下，即以1/2（1/3（A+B+C）+B）=1/6（A＋4B＋C）为平均面积乘上高度2h，如此得二片在一起的体积1/3（A＋4B＋C）h这方法叫做索波列夫斯基的方法，或辛普生法，巴乌曼法及索波列夫斯基的方法不好比较，有时这个精密些，有时那个精密些，但以下的公式比这两个方法都精密些：
  h〔1/3（A+4B+C）-2/15（T（A，B）+T（B，C））+1/15T（A，C）〕
    算水库的方法不仅可以用来算水库，当然还可以用来估矿藏，算土石方等等。感谢从事于估计矿藏量的工作者向我们介绍了巴乌曼法，现在我们以第四法来回报他们的好意，供他们试用和参考。
