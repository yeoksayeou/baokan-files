Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 13th - A rally organized by the French Communist Party to support amnesty for anti-Franco Spanish patriots and persecuted Portuguese democrats was held last night at the Mutualité Hall in Paris.

    French Communist Party Secretary Duclos, Political Bureau member Raymond Guyot, and former Communist Party councilor of Pyrénées-Orientales, André Tourné, all spoke at the meeting.

    Duclos said that the Spanish people's anger at the Franco regime is growing, and the struggle for amnesty in Spain is also expanding. Duclos called on the French people to take action to further expand this movement.

    Duclos stressed that supporting Spanish patriots is also a political action to safeguard France's own cause. He said that forcing the Franco dictatorship to retreat is clearly also a blow to the reactionary forces in France.

    Duclos then spoke about the situation in Portugal, emphasizing that the Portuguese dictator Salazar, who has long occupied power, has imprisoned countless Portuguese patriots.

    Duclos finally expressed his full support for the Spanish Communist Party, saying that the Spanish Communist Party, despite the repression, is bravely carrying out the anti-Franco struggle, pointing out the way forward for the Spanish people.

    Raymond Guyot, in his opening remarks to the conference, first paid tribute to the heroic Spanish people who are engaged in unremitting struggle.

    Raymond Guyot said: The cause of the people of Spain and Portugal, as well as the people of Greece and Glezos and his heroic comrades, is the common cause of all free people.

    André Tourné emphasized that the struggle to win amnesty for all political prisoners in Franco's prisons is the struggle to win freedom everywhere. The struggle to win amnesty for political exiles and to allow them to return to their homeland is the struggle for international détente and the struggle for peace.

    At the end of the meeting, a resolution was passed, paying warm tribute to the victims of repression in Spain, and firmly demanding that Spain grant amnesty to all imprisoned and exiled political prisoners, and guaranteeing firm solidarity with all Spanish democrats to work together to stop fascist repression.

    The conference also passed a similar resolution in support of the victims of repression in Portugal.

    These two resolutions will be submitted today to the Spanish and Portuguese embassies in Paris.

    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 11th - According to "l'Humanité", the Spanish Franco regime continues to use rampant terror against people of all strata in the country. In the last two months alone, 500 people have been arrested, many of whom are young people.

    Spanish domestic courts are holding trials of communists, socialists and Catholics who participated in the nationwide protest strike on June 18 last year.

    This terror action by Franco's executioners has aroused the indignation of the French public.

    More than two thousand workers at the Southern Aircraft Factory in the suburbs of Paris jointly signed a protest letter to the Spanish Embassy in France. Many staff and university students have also submitted many similar letters of protest.

    巴黎集会声援西葡两国爱国者
    杜克洛说西共向西班牙人民指出了道路
    新华社巴黎13日电　由法国共产党组织的争取大赦反佛朗哥的西班牙爱国者和葡萄牙受迫害的民主人士的声援大会，昨天晚间在巴黎互助大厅举行。
    法国共产党书记杜克洛，政治局委员雷蒙·居约以及共产党前东比利牛斯省议员安德烈·杜尔纳都在会上讲了话。
    杜克洛说，西班牙人民对佛朗哥政权的愤怒正在日益加剧，争取在西班牙实行大赦的斗争也在日益扩展。杜克洛号召法国人民行动起来，使这个运动日益扩大。
    杜克洛着重指出，声援西班牙爱国者也是维护法国自己的事业的政治行动，他说，迫使佛朗哥独裁政权退却，显然也是对法国反动势力的打击。
  杜克洛接着谈到葡萄牙局势，他强调指出，长期以来霸占政权的葡萄牙独裁者萨拉查已经把无数葡萄牙爱国者关进监狱。
    杜克洛最后表示完全支持西班牙共产党，他说，西班牙共产党不顾镇压、英勇地进行着反佛朗哥的斗争，向西班牙人民指出今后的道路。
    雷蒙·居约在致大会开幕词时首先向进行不懈斗争的英勇的西班牙人民致敬。
    雷蒙·居约说：西班牙、葡萄牙两国人民以及希腊人民和格列索斯及其英勇的同伴们的事业，是所有自由人民的共同事业。
    安德烈·杜尔纳强调指出，争取大赦佛朗哥监狱中的所有政治犯的斗争，就是争取自由在一切地方获得胜利的斗争。争取使政治流亡者获得大赦以及争取让他们返回祖国的斗争，就是争取国际局势和缓和争取和平的斗争。
    大会结束时通过了一项决议，决议向在西班牙遭到镇压的受害者热烈致敬，并且坚决要求西班牙大赦一切被监禁的和遭放逐的全体政治犯，决议同时保证坚决地同一切西班牙民主人士团结一致，协力行动，来制止法西斯镇压。
    大会还通过了一项类似的决议，声援在葡萄牙被镇压的受害者。
      这两项决议将在今天递交给西班牙和葡萄牙驻巴黎大使馆。
    据新华社巴黎11电　据“人道报”报道，西班牙佛朗哥政权继续对国内各阶层人民施用猖獗的恐怖手段。仅最近两个月就逮捕了五百人，其中有许多青年人。
    西班牙国内的法庭和法院正在开庭审判参加去年6月18日全国抗议罢工的共产党人，社会党人和天主教人士。
    佛朗哥刽子手们的这种恐怖行动激起了法国公众的愤慨。
    巴黎市郊的南方飞机工厂的两千多名工人联合签署了一份抗议书交给西班牙驻法国大使馆。还有许多职员、大学生提出许多类似的抗议书。
