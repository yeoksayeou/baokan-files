    The Glorious Victory of Socialism
    ——Celebrating the 15th Anniversary of the Liberation of Hungary

    Today is the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Hungary. The Chinese people, with boundless joy, warmly celebrate this glorious festival of the fraternal Hungarian people and cheer the great achievements of the Hungarian people in building socialism over the past fifteen years.

    Fifteen years ago today, the Hungarian people, with the help of the heroic Soviet army, were liberated from the iron heel of German fascism. The Hungarian people's centuries-long desire for national independence and freedom was finally realized. A true spring appeared on the long-suffering land of Hungary. Over the past fifteen years, under the leadership of the proletarian party, the Hungarian people have been striding forward on the broad road of socialism. In a short historical period, the Hungarian people have victoriously carried out the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Today, this formerly backward agricultural country has been built into an industrially developed socialist country.

    The socialist cause of the Hungarian people has not been smooth sailing. In October 1956, the counter-revolutionary forces within Hungary, colluding with imperialism, launched a riot in an attempt to destroy the socialist cause of the Hungarian people and restore capitalism and fascism in Hungary. However, the Hungarian people, tempered in long-term revolutionary struggles, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kádár, adhered to the socialist path and waged a tenacious struggle against the domestic counter-revolutionary forces supported by imperialism. The Hungarian people's just and heroic struggle received the full support of the Soviet Union and the people of other countries in the socialist camp. They finally thoroughly and decisively smashed the counter-revolution's frenzied attack and defended the socialist cause of their motherland.

    The heroic Hungarian people were tempered in the serious class struggle against the counter-revolution. Their eyes became brighter, their socialist consciousness was greatly enhanced, and the proletarian dictatorship and the worker-peasant alliance were further strengthened. For three and a half years, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has led the Hungarian people in arduous struggles on the political and ideological fronts, greatly consolidating the socialist system. Under the strong leadership of the Party, the Hungarian people, united as one, have overcome numerous difficulties and continued to advance bravely along the socialist road.

    In the past three years, the Hungarian people have made great achievements on the economic construction front. The Hungarian people used the year 1957 to quickly restore the national economy, which had been severely damaged in the counter-revolutionary riot, and began to implement the three-year plan for developing the national economy from 1958, and completed this plan ahead of schedule in two years, increasing industrial production in 1959 by 24% and agricultural production by 13% compared with 1957. The Hungarian people have also made great progress in the socialist transformation of agriculture. In the past two years, Hungary has successively seen two surging waves of agricultural collectivization. After these two waves, the proportion of cultivated land occupied by agricultural cooperatives in Hungary has increased from 14% to 56%. Currently, 74% of the towns and villages across Hungary have achieved collectivization. The great victories achieved by the Hungarian people in socialist construction and socialist transformation once again prove the great vitality of Marxism-Leninism and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

    Significant achievements have also been made on the ideological and cultural front in Hungary. Over the past three years, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has adhered to the struggle on two fronts against revisionism and sectarianism, thereby strengthening the leading position of Marxism-Leninism in the ideological field. This has greatly improved the political and ideological level of the entire Party and the people of the country, providing an important guarantee for the Hungarian people to accelerate socialist construction.

    The Seventh Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, held at the end of November last year, summarized the experience of the Hungarian socialist revolution and socialist construction, and formulated a five-year plan (1961-1965) for the development of the national economy, stipulating that the main task during this plan period is to complete the foundation-laying work of socialism and accelerate socialist construction. The new five-year plan presents a magnificent picture before the Hungarian people and encourages the Hungarian people to accelerate the struggle to building socialism. The brilliant achievement made by the Hungarian people in socialist construction and their high morale are an important factor in the continuous increase in the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the forces defending world peace.

    While leading the Hungarian people to advance along the socialist road, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, resolutely opposed modern revisionism, the most dangerous enemy in the current international communist movement, and made unremitting efforts to strengthen Hungarian-Soviet friendship and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Hungarian People's Republic follows a peaceful foreign policy, develops friendly relations with all countries, supports the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, resolutely opposes the imperialist policy of aggression and war, and, together with the fraternal socialist countries, has made outstanding contributions to maintaining European peace and world peace. All this makes the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian people greatly respected by the people of all countries who are striving for peace and socialism.

    The Chinese people and the Hungarian people are close brothers in the socialist family. For ten years, the fraternal friendship between our two peoples has been continuously strengthened and consolidated. Our two countries have achieved great success in mutual assistance and cooperation in the political, economic, and cultural fields. The Chinese people express sincere gratitude for the assistance given by the Hungarian people to our country's socialist construction. The signing of the Sino-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation last spring is an important symbol of the further strengthening of our two countries' friendly and cooperative relations. The mutual visits of leaders of our two countries' parties and governments have powerfully strengthened the unbreakable fraternal friendship between our two peoples. On this glorious festival of the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Hungary, let us express our best wishes and congratulations:

    We wish the Hungarian people even more brilliant victories in the cause of socialist construction!

    May the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples last forever!

    May the unity of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union be further consolidated!

    社会主义的光辉胜利
    ——庆祝匈牙利解放十五周年
    今天是匈牙利解放十五周年纪念日。中国人民怀着无比欢欣的心情，热烈祝贺兄弟的匈牙利人民的这个光辉的节日，欢呼匈牙利人民十五年来建设社会主义的伟大成就。
    十五年前的今天，匈牙利人民在英勇的苏军的帮助下，从德国法西斯的铁蹄下解放出来。匈牙利人民多少世纪以来对于民族独立和自由的渴望，终于实现了。匈牙利苦难重重的土地上，出现了真正的春天。十五年来，匈牙利人民在无产阶级政党的领导下，沿着社会主义的康庄大道，阔步前进。在短短的历史时期里，匈牙利人民胜利地进行了社会主义革命和社会主义建设。今天，这个原来落后的农业国家已建设成为一个工业发达的社会主义国家了。
    匈牙利人民的社会主义事业并不是一帆风顺的。1956年10月匈牙利国内的反革命势力和帝国主义互相勾结，发动暴乱，妄图摧毁匈牙利人民的社会主义事业，使资本主义和法西斯制度在匈牙利复辟。但是，在长期的革命斗争中经受考验的匈牙利人民，在以卡达尔同志为首的匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导下，坚持走社会主义的道路，同帝国主义支持的国内反革命势力进行了顽强的斗争。匈牙利人民正义的英勇的斗争，获得了苏联和社会主义阵营各国人民的全力支持。他们终于彻底、干脆地粉碎了反革命的疯狂进攻，捍卫了祖国的社会主义事业。
    英勇的匈牙利人民在同反革命进行严重的阶级斗争中受到了锻炼。他们的眼睛更亮了，社会主义觉悟大大提高了，无产阶级专政和工农联盟进一步加强了。三年半以来，匈牙利社会主义工人党领导匈牙利人民，在政治战线上和思想战线上进行了艰巨的斗争，大大地巩固了社会主义制度。在党的坚强的领导下，匈牙利人民团结一致，克服重重困难，沿着社会主义的道路继续英勇前进。
    在过去三年多的时间里，匈牙利人民在经济建设战线上取得了巨大的成就。匈牙利人民以1957年一年的时间，迅速地恢复了在反革命暴乱中被严重破坏的国民经济，从1958年开始执行发展国民经济的三年计划，并且用两年的时间提前完成了这个计划，使1959年的工业生产比1957年增加24％，农业生产增加13％。匈牙利人民在农业社会主义改造方面也取得了巨大的进展。最近两年中，匈牙利连续出现了两次汹涌澎湃的农业合作化运动高潮。经过这两次高潮，匈牙利农业合作社耕地面积占全国耕地面积的比重，已从14％增加到56％。目前匈牙利全国已有74％的村镇实现了合作化。匈牙利人民在社会主义建设和社会主义改造方面所取得的伟大胜利，再一次证明了马克思列宁主义的伟大生命力和社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    匈牙利的思想和文化战线上也取得了重大的成就。三年来，匈牙利社会主义工人党坚持了反对修正主义和宗派主义两条战线上的斗争，从而加强了马克思列宁主义在思想领域中的领导地位。这就大大提高了全党和全国人民的政治思想水平，为匈牙利人民加速社会主义建设提供了重要的保证。
    去年11月底举行的匈牙利社会主义工人党第七次代表大会，总结了匈牙利社会主义革命和社会主义建设的经验，制订了发展国民经济的五年计划（1961—1965年），规定这个计划期间的主要任务是完成社会主义的奠基工作，加速社会主义建设。新的五年计划在匈牙利人民面前展现了一幅绚丽的图景，鼓舞了匈牙利人民加速建设社会主义的斗争。匈牙利人民在社会主义建设中取得的光辉成就和他们的昂扬斗志，是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量和保卫世界和平的力量不断增加的一个重要因素。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党在领导匈牙利人民沿着社会主义道路前进的同时，高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，坚决反对当前国际共产主义运动中最危险的敌人——现代修正主义，并为加强匈苏友谊、加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结进行了不懈的努力。匈牙利人民共和国遵循着和平外交政策，发展着同各国的友好关系，支援亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的民族民主运动，坚决反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，同社会主义兄弟国家一起，为维护欧洲和平和世界和平作出了卓越的贡献。这一切使匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利人民受到世界各国争取和平和社会主义的人民的极大的尊敬。
    中国人民和匈牙利人民是社会主义大家庭中的亲密兄弟。十年以来，我们两国人民的兄弟友谊不断加强，日益巩固。我们两国在政治、经济和文化等方面的互助合作取得了巨大的成就。中国人民对于匈牙利人民给予我国社会主义建设事业的援助，表示真诚的感谢。去年春天中匈友好合作条约的签订，是我们两国友好合作关系进一步加强的重要标志。我们两国党政领导人的互相访问，有力地加强了我们两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊。当此匈牙利解放十五周年的光荣节日，让我们表示最好的心愿和祝贺：
    祝匈牙利人民在社会主义建设事业中取得更加光辉的胜利！
    祝中匈两国人民的兄弟友谊万古长青！
    祝以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营的团结更加巩固！
