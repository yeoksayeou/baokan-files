Supplement to Water Reservoir Volume Calculation

This is a supplement to the article "Calculating Water Reservoir Volume" published on April 10th. The supplement is divided into two parts: (1) Explaining the calculation method for the area of a planar figure, which answers a reader's question—how to calculate the area without using a planimeter; also, the area calculation is required in the previous article. (2) Introducing a method for calculating the volume of a water reservoir without a topographic map.

(I) Calculating Planar Area

(1) Parallel Line Method: Draw a batch of equidistant parallel lines, assuming the distance is d. The lengths of these parallel lines intercepted by the figure are l1, l2, ..., and the sum of these lengths multiplied by d can be approximately used as the area of this figure (the area of one section can be calculated by 1/2(l1 + l2)d).

Of course, 1/3(l1 + 4l2 + l3)d can also be used to represent the area of two consecutive sections.

(2) Grid Method: Draw grids with sides of length d. The number of grid points falling within the figure multiplied by d2 can be used as an approximation of the area. We can also place a batch of chess pieces on the figure at equal distances, and then calculate the number of chess pieces to obtain the area.

Error Reduction Method: Arrange the parallel lines or grids in several different directions, calculate the results, and then average these results to reduce errors.

(II) Calculating Volume

Draw grids on the water surface of the reservoir. At each grid point, measure the depth. The sum of the depths multiplied by the area of one grid is the approximate value of the reservoir's volume.

Alternatively, you can first find the average depth and then multiply it by the area of the horizontal plane. These methods are simpler than the previous method, but the precision is sometimes poorer.

    水库容积计算的补充
    这是4月10日发表的“算水库容积”一文的补充，补充分为两个部分：（一）说明一下平面图形的面积的算法，这回答一位读者所提出的问题——不用求面积仪怎样计算面积；同时关于面积的计算也是前文所需要的。（二）介绍一个没有地形图的水库容积的计算方法。
    （一）求平面积
    （1）平行线法　作一批等距离的平行线，假定距离是d，这一批平行线被图形所截取的长度是l1，l2，……这些长度的总和乘以d就可以差不多用来作为这图形的面积，（一条的面积可以用1／2（l1＋l2）d来计算）。
    当然还可以用1／3（l1＋4l2＋l3）d来代表连续两条的面积。
    （2）打方格法　打以d为边的方格，格子点落在图内的点数乘以d2，就可以用来作为面积的近似值。我们当然也可以在图形上按等距离摆上一批棋子，然后计算棋子数便可以得出面积。
    减少误差法　把平行线或方格按几种不同方向摆好算出结果，再把这些结果求平均，这样便能减少误差。
    （二）求体积
    在水库水面上打方格，在每一格点，测出深度，深度总和乘以一个方格的面积，便是水库容积的近似值。
    另法，可以先求深度的平均数，再乘上水平面的面积。这些方法与上次的方法比较是简易的，当然精密度有时要差一些。
