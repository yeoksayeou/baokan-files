Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 1st. Hebei Province's "small local groups" cement industry has made significant contributions to production and construction. From the beginning of last year to March 22nd of this year, the province's fifty-plus "small local groups" cement plants have produced 300,387 tons of cement. The average cement grade has reached over 300, with 20% reaching a grade of 400.

These "small local groups" cement plants were developed from small to large, from indigenous to modern, during the Great Leap Forward. Party committees at all levels, in the spirit of prioritizing indigenous methods, mobilized the masses to vigorously develop small-scale cement industries. In just a few months, more than 7,000 "small indigenous groups" cement plants were established throughout the province. In early 1959, various localities carried out a series of rectification, consolidation, and improvement efforts on the "small indigenous groups" cement plants, gradually transitioning from "small indigenous groups" to "small local groups."

Since the beginning of 1960, the production outlook of the province's "small local groups" cement plants has been undergoing rapid changes, thriving and flourishing. In February of this year, the monthly plan was overfulfilled, with an increase of 3.35% compared to the actual output in January. By March 13th, the first quarter production plan was completed eighteen days ahead of schedule.

    河北小洋群水泥工业大步向前  一年多来生产水泥三十多万吨
    据新华社天津1日电　河北省“小洋群”水泥工业对生产建设作出很大贡献。从去年年初到今年3月22日，全省五十多个“小洋群”水泥厂，已经生产出水泥三十万三千零八十七吨。水泥的平均标号达到三百号以上，其中四百号的占20％。
    这些“小洋群”水泥厂，是在大跃进中由小到大、由土到洋发展起来的。各级党委本着土法先上马的精神，发动群众大办小型水泥工业。在短短的几个月内，全省就建立了七千多个“小土群”水泥厂，1959年初，各地对“小土群”水泥厂进行了一系列的整顿、巩固和提高工作，逐步由“小土群”过渡到“小洋群”。
    进入1960年以来，全省“小洋群”水泥厂的生产面貌日新月异，欣欣向荣。今年2月份超额完成了月计划，比1月份实际产量提高了3.35％。到3月13日又提前十八天完成了首季生产计划。
