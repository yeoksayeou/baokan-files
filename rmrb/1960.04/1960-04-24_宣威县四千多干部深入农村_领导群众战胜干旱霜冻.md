Xuanwei County, Yunnan Province: More than 4,000 cadres led by the CCP Xuanwei County Committee went deep into the countryside, sharing weal and woe and laboring alongside the county's more than 500,000 people of all ethnic groups. They conducted meticulous investigations and research, painstakingly planned and considered solutions, identified problems, and proposed practical and feasible solutions, achieving great success in directing the county's drought resistance, frost prevention, and freeze protection efforts. Currently, more than 80,000 wells have been dug throughout the county, and more than 220,000 pieces of various water-lifting tools have been produced, enabling the irrigated area of dry land to more than double and the irrigated area of paddy fields to expand from 60% of the total area to the current 77%.

This year, Xuanwei County has been plagued by frequent drought, frost, and freeze damage. Spring crops have suffered from unprecedented frost and freeze damage in decades. The drought situation is continuing to develop, with rainfall decreasing by more than 40% compared to the same period last year, which was also a year of severe drought, seriously affecting the transplanting of summer crops.

In this situation, the CCP Xuanwei County Committee believes that strengthening leadership, going deep among the masses, and uniting all ethnic groups in the county is crucial to overcoming various natural disasters, as is creating typical experiences with universal significance to promote the overall situation. Three-quarters of the county's office cadres carried hoes, manure baskets, and other tools to the areas most severely affected by the disaster to eat, live, and work with the masses, and to search for water sources and dig wells. Pu Zhouyan, the secretary of the Wenxing People's Commune Party Committee, led the commune's cadres, focusing on the Wenxing Management District. While mobilizing the masses, he personally rolled up his trouser legs and took the lead in operating water wheels and carrying water to fight the drought. Some cadres carried water more than 1,100 times within a distance of half a li in ten days, while others persevered on the water wheels for a long time, swelling their feet. This motivated more than 2,000 people in the area to fight the drought. Thanks to sufficient water, the spring crops grew very well, and many visitors praised the wheat here as the "king of wheat." More than 10,000 people in the entire commune carried out sixteen consecutive disaster relief activities, overcoming drought, freeze, frost, and insect pests, making it possible to increase the yield of spring crops by about 70% this year. The cadres' vigorous and energetic style had a profound impact on the people of all ethnic groups. When the county encountered freeze damage, the Minister of Propaganda of the County Party Committee, the Secretary of the Longtan Commune Party Committee, and the Party members and activists of Longtan Commune worked together to cut tree branches and burn smoke to rescue the spring crops. The next morning, the inspection proved that smoke could overcome freeze damage. That night, this experience was promoted throughout the commune, and 200,000 piles of smoke were lit, and the fog filled the Wumeng Mountains. Finally, more than 10,000 mu of wheat in the entire commune were rescued.

In Xuanwei County, cadres at all levels, in the process of going deep into the grassroots, not only use their exemplary actions to drive the people of all ethnic groups to fight various natural disasters, but also pay great attention to investigation and research, "dissecting sparrows," using points to lead the surface, and guiding the general. Comrade Song Bingyin, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, led cadres and technicians, trekking dozens of li, surveying water sources, visiting farmers, and planning with farmers. Based on the water needed for corn sowing and seedling growth and the water output of the wells, he concluded that it was most appropriate to dig a well for every five mu of cornfields to fight drought. Through summarization, he also solved technical problems such as how to choose the location for digging wells and how to dig wells. He organized the secretaries of the commune party committees throughout the county to visit and spread the experience. The county immediately launched a vigorous "one well for five mu of land" movement. In less than half a month, the number of wells increased rapidly from 4,000 to 80,000. Now, leading cadres are going deep into reality, thinking hard, creating typical experiences, and driving the overall situation. This has become a trend in Xuanwei County. In the past month and a half, there have been fifteen typical experiences related to drought resistance and exceeding production targets, summarized by the leaders of Xuanwei County and communes and promoted throughout the county, which have played a significant role in the current production movement.

    宣威县四千多干部深入农村
    领导群众战胜干旱霜冻
    本报讯　云南省中共宣威县委领导干部率领全县四千多名干部深入农村，与全县五十多万人民同甘共苦，并肩劳动，细致地调查研究，艰苦地谋划思考；发现问题，提出切实可行的解决办法，在指挥全县抗旱、防霜、防冻等各项工作中取得了很大成绩。现在，全县已打井八万多眼，赶制出各种提水工具二十二万多件，使全县能保证得到灌溉的旱地增加了一倍多，保证能得到灌溉的水田由占总面积的60％扩大到现在的77％。
    今年，宣威县旱、霜、冻等自然灾害频繁交加，小春作物受到了几十年来未有的霜灾和冻灾，目前，旱象正在继续发展，与大旱的去年同期比较，降雨量减少了四成以上，严重地影响了大春作物的栽插。
    在这种形势下，中共宣威县委认为加强领导、深入群众把全县各族人民拧成一股绳；创造带有普遍意义的典型经验以推动全局是战胜各种自然灾害的关键之一。全县四分之三的机关干部都携带锄头和粪筐等工具到灾情最严重的地区去与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，查水源打水井。文兴人民公社党委书记浦周彦率领公社的干部以文兴管理区为重点，一边发动群众，一边亲自挽起裤脚管带头车水、挑水抗旱，有的干部十天内在半里路的距离内来回挑水一千一百多挑，有的干部长时间坚持在水车上戽水把脚搞肿了。这样，带动了全区二千多人抗旱，小春作物由于得到足够的水，都长得很好，许多到这里参观的人都赞扬这里的小麦是“麦王”。全公社一万多人连续进行了十六次抗灾活动，战胜了旱、冻、霜、虫等灾害，使今年的小春可望增产七成左右。干部雷厉风行、生龙活虎的作风给各族人民以深刻的影响。在全县遇到了冻灾时，县委宣传部长、龙潭公社党委书记和龙潭公社的党员积极分子一道，砍树枝烧烟火抢救小春，翌晨，检查证明烟雾能战胜冻灾，当晚便在全社推广了这一经验，全社燃起了二十万堆烟火，乌蒙山中大雾弥漫，终于抢救住了全社的一万多亩小麦。
    宣威县的各级干部在深入基层中，不仅用自己的模范行动带动各族人民奋战各种自然灾害，而且十分注意调查研究，“解剖麻雀”，以点带面，指导一般。县委第一书记宋丙寅同志率领干部和技术人员，跋涉几十里，踏勘水源，访问农民，和农民一起谋划，根据玉米播种和苗棵生长所需的水量以及水井的出水量，得出了在平均每五亩玉米地里开一眼井抗旱最合适的结论；又通过总结，解决了如何选择打井的地点和如何打井等技术问题。组织全县公社党委书记参观传播经验。全县马上开展了轰轰烈烈的“五亩地一眼井”运动，不到半月，水井的数量从四千眼迅速增加到八万眼。现在，领导干部深入实际、艰苦地进行思考、创造典型经验，带动全面。已在宣威县形成一种风气。近一个半月来，由宣威县和公社领导干部总结并在全县推广的有关抗旱、超包产等典型经验有十五件，对当前生产运动起了很大作用。
