Comrades Chairman, fellow representatives, and fellow committee members:

I completely agree with and support Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1960," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft," Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin's report on striving to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and the "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress." These reports incisively summarize the unparalleled superiority of the continuous two years of the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement in our country, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction. Under the banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, all aspects of socialist construction have achieved very encouraging accomplishments. The 1960 plan is objective, feasible, and a plan for continued Great Leap Forward. Therefore, after listening to the reports, we feel even more that the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is wise and correct. In addition to expressing our agreement and support to the conference here, we will definitely convey it well after returning and conscientiously implement it in actual work.

Now I would like to talk about the relationship between urban people's communes and the participation of family members of industrialists and businessmen in labor. From last spring to now, I have inspected several different types of urban people's communes in Shenyang and learned about some situations. Please point out any inappropriate points.

There are currently eighty-four urban people's communes in Shenyang. These communes were established under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the promotion of the Great Leap Forward situation, the inspiration of rural people's communes, the enthusiastic demands of the masses, and the guidance of leaders who took advantage of the situation. Before this, street residents had already organized civilian-run industrial production and held some social welfare undertakings such as nurseries and kindergartens. It can be seen that the emergence of urban people's communes is not accidental. It is a product of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the inevitable result of urban political and economic development.

Although the urban people's communes in Shenyang have not been established for long, under the leadership of the Party, after more than a year of efforts, they have established four hundred and eighty-four factories, with more than two thousand nine hundred products, and an output value of more than 170 million yuan, which is expected to reach 500 million yuan this year. Due to the development of production, social welfare undertakings have also greatly increased, and those with labor ability have been able to obtain employment. This shows that, like rural people's communes, they have their unparalleled superiority and strong vitality. Although the situation in cities is more complicated than in rural areas, those women from bourgeois families, small merchants, small business owners, and small capitalists have, in the big family of the commune, through participating in productive labor, had more opportunities to receive the Party's education, their thinking has greatly improved, the relationship between people has become closer, the bourgeois way of life has been basically eliminated, and family and neighborhood disputes have been basically eliminated; a new atmosphere of everyone working, caring for each other, family unity, and neighborhood harmony has emerged. It can be seen that the development of urban people's communes will be faster and healthier, and will attract more people to embark on this broad road. This is a powerful tool for changing consumers into producers and transforming old cities to build new cities. Therefore, I believe that it is of great significance to run urban people's communes on a large scale, run street industries on a large scale, further organize urban people, and completely liberate thousands of urban housewives. We, the family members of industrialists and businessmen, under the call of the Party and the government to the broad masses of women to voluntarily participate in social production labor, should actively and bravely and cheerfully participate in various social labor so as to serve and transform better.

The establishment of urban people's communes has not only been actively supported by the broad masses of working women, but also by women from bourgeois families and family members of industrialists and businessmen. Except for a small number of people who have doubts and are watching, most people also support it to varying degrees. Therefore, many people have participated in street industrial production and other social life and welfare undertakings, fundamentally eliminating the hotbed of capitalist development. The urban people's communes in Shenyang, starting from organizing production, proposed that every household should be busy with production and no household should have idle people, and organized the people's lives well. Therefore, they have been welcomed by the people of the city, and the number of people participating in the commune has increased. According to incomplete statistics, there are now more than a thousand family members of industrialists and businessmen in Shenyang participating in the commune, accounting for more than one-third of the family members of city and district-level representatives of industrialists and businessmen who have the conditions to participate in productive labor. When they started to run street industries on their own initiative, they received the correct leadership and support of the Party committees at all levels, and the municipal and district Minjian (Democratic National Construction Association) and the Federation of Industry and Commerce also gave great assistance in terms of manpower and material resources. They started by building factory buildings themselves, transporting materials, and raising funds on their own, from producing simple products to producing more complex products. For example, the family members of industrialists and businessmen in Heping District of the city built factory buildings, transported materials, and raised funds from scratch. In the initial organization of street industrial production, they encountered some difficulties, such as lack of materials, lack of technology, and inability to receive work in the early stage of factory construction. Some units were afraid that these women would not be able to do it. However, under the direct leadership of the Party committee, relying on the masses, they overcame the difficulties, raised everyone's understanding, and strengthened their confidence. For example, making chain links for the Jianping Iron Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, and making lamp parts for the Shuguang Electric Factory were all completed under the leadership of the Party and with the patient help and guidance of veteran workers. Through production practice, these women initially mastered some production skills, so later they produced some small hardware, sand casting, and made carbon rods.

In the past year or so, due to rectification and improvement, the production organization and management level of urban people's communes and street-run industries have been further consolidated and improved. Due to the leadership of the Party, the political awareness of the family members of industrialists and businessmen participating in production has been improved to varying degrees, and their production technical knowledge has also been greatly enhanced. Therefore, many family members of industrialists and businessmen have been promoted to become factory leaders and backbones, serving as factory directors and workshop directors and other important positions.

Many people, due to practical production labor training, have gradually realized the shame of indulging in enjoyment and living a parasitic life in the past, and their ideas of despising labor and being fond of ease and comfort have begun to undergo relatively significant changes, and they are transforming towards becoming self-reliant laborers. The atmosphere of glory in labor and shame in parasitism has gradually formed. They have a further deep understanding of the noble qualities, infinite wisdom, and soaring revolutionary drive of the working people. Their attitudes and views on labor have also greatly changed. They have shortened the distance from the working people, enhanced their ideological feelings with the working people, and established the spirit of humbly learning from the working people.

The more important significance of industrialists and businessmen and their family members participating in the production of urban people's communes is to find a basic way for the transformation of their political stance. Through productive labor, they realize that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can they control their own destiny and have a bright future.

Practice has proved that under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line and encouraged by the situation of two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, most industrialists and businessmen and their family members actively participate in labor, participate in the production of urban people's communes, and gradually develop labor habits; however, a small number of people still adopt a passive waiting attitude, dislike labor, and are unwilling to participate in this new type of social organization of the commune. These people reflect a lack of understanding of participating in socialist labor. I feel that these people need Minjian (Democratic National Construction Association) and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, to assist the Women's Federation to do more specific work and to get them involved in glorious production labor, engage in labor within their ability, and completely liberate and transform themselves through labor.

Fellow representatives, we have been greatly inspired and educated after hearing the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin. These three reports have strengthened our confidence and strength. As a member of a democratic party, I must, under the leadership of the Party, actively serve and strengthen transformation around the central tasks of the Party, recognize the situation, grasp my destiny, "lean to one side wholeheartedly," always listen to the Party, and do whatever the Party points to. Let us all advance bravely to complete and overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan!

    工商业者家属正在转化
    巩天民代表的发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春副总理所作的“关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理所作的“关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告”，谭震林副总理所作的为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的报告和“全国人大常委会的工作报告”。这些报告，精辟地总结了我国在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，所出现的连续两年大跃进和人民公社化的无比优越性。在总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三面鲜艳的红旗招展下，各项社会主义建设都取得了非常使人振奋的成就。1960年的计划是客观可行的，也是继续大跃进的计划。因此，当我们听过报告后更加感觉到我国人民在党中央和毛主席领导的英明正确。在这里除向大会表示同意和拥护外，回去后一定作好传达和在实际工作中认真贯彻执行。
    现在我想讲一讲：城市人民公社与工商业者家属参加劳动的关系问题。从去年春天到现在，我在沈阳市内视察了几个不同类型的城市人民公社，了解到一些情况。不妥之处，请予指正。
    沈阳市现有八十四个城市人民公社。这些公社是在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，大跃进形势的推动下，农村人民公社的启示下和群众热烈地要求，领导因势利导建立起来的。在这之前，街道居民就已组织了民办工业生产和举办了一些托儿所、幼儿园等社会福利事业。由此可见，城市人民公社的出现并不是偶然的。它是总路线、大跃进的产物，是城市政治、经济发展的必然结果。
    沈阳市的城市人民公社，虽然成立不久，但是，在党的领导下，经过一年多的努力，已建立起四百八十四个工厂，产品达两千九百多种，产值达一亿七千多万元，预计今年可达五亿元。由于生产的发展，社会福利事业也随之有很大的增加，有劳动能力的均得以就业等，这就显示出了它同农村人民公社一样，都有它的无比优越性和强大的生命力。虽然城市比农村情况复杂，但是那些出身于资产阶级家庭的妇女、小商贩、小业主、小资本家的人们，都在公社的大家庭里，通过参加生产劳动，有更多的机会受到党的教育，他们的思想大有进步，人与人之间的关系密切了，改变了资产阶级的生活方式，基本上消灭了家庭的和邻里的纠纷；出现了人人劳动，互相关心，家庭团结，邻里和睦的新风气。由此可以看出，城市人民公社的发展将更加迅速和健康，并将吸引更多人，走上这个康庄大道，这对于改变消费者为生产者，改造旧城市建立新城市是强有力的工具。所以我认为城市大办人民公社，大办街道工业，把城市人民进一步地组织起来，并使成千上万的城市家庭妇女彻底解放出来，意义是极为重大的。我们工商业者家属，在党和政府对广大妇女提出自愿参加社会生产劳动的号召下，应当积极奋勇地、心情愉快地参加各种社会劳动，这样，才能更好地服务，更好地改造。
    城市人民公社的成立，不仅得到广大劳动妇女的积极拥护，就是出身于资产阶级家庭的妇女，及工商业家属，除有一部分人抱有疑虑观望外，多数人在不同程度上也是拥护的。因而有不少人参加了街道工业生产及其他社会生活福利事业，从根本上消除了资本主义发展的温床。沈阳市的城市人民公社，由于从组织生产入手，提出家家忙生产，户户无闲人，并组织好人民生活。因此，获得全市人民的欢迎，参加公社的人数越来越多。沈阳市的工商界的家属，据不完全统计，现在已有千余人参加了公社，约占全市工商业者市、区级代表人的家属有参加生产劳动条件的三分之一以上。她们在开始自动办街道工业时，就得到了各级党委的正确领导和支持，市、区民建和工商联在人力、物力上也给以很大的援助，开始自己动手盖厂房，由生产简单的产品，到生产比较复杂的产品。如该市和平区工商业者家属，白手起家的修建厂房、搬运物资和自筹资金等。在开始组织街道工业生产时，曾碰到一些困难，如缺乏物资，没有技术，建厂初期收不进活来，有的单位怕这些妇女干不来等；但是在党委直接领导下，依靠群众，克服了困难，提高了大家的认识，坚定了信心，如在给公私合营建平铁工厂作锁链子和给曙光电气厂做灯管零件等，都是在党的领导下和老工人耐心帮助带动下，完成了加工生产任务。由于经过生产实践，使这些妇女初步地掌握了一些生产技能，因此后来她们就自己生产些小五金、翻砂和制造炭精棒等产品。
    一年多以来，由于整顿和提高，城市人民公社办工业，街道办工业的生产组织，经营管理水平，更加巩固和提高了。参加生产的工商业者家属，由于党的领导，政治觉悟都有了不同程度的提高，生产技术知识也有了很大的增进，因此有许多工商业者家属，被提拔成为工厂领导和骨干，担任厂长和车间主任等重要职务。
    许多人由于受到了实际生产劳动锻炼，逐步认识到过去贪图享乐，过寄生生活的可耻，鄙视劳动，好逸恶劳的思想开始有了比较显著的转变，并正在向成为自食其力的劳动者方向转化。劳动光荣，寄食可耻的风气，已经逐渐形成。对劳动人民的高贵品质，无穷智慧和冲天的革命干劲，有了进一步深刻的体会。对劳动态度和看法也有了很大改变。缩短了同劳动人民之间的距离，增强了和劳动人民之间的思想感情，树立了虚心向劳动人民学习的精神。
    工商业者和工商业者家属参加城市人民公社的生产，更重要的意义，就是为政治立场的改造找到一个基本途径。通过生产劳动认识到只有在共产党领导下才能掌握自己的命运，才有光明的前途。
    实践证明在党的总路线光辉照耀下，在两年连续大跃进的形势鼓舞下，大多数工商业者和工商业者家属，多是积极参加劳动，参加城市人民公社生产，逐渐地养成了劳动习惯；但也有少数人还采取消极等待观望的态度，厌恶劳动，不愿参加公社这一新型的社会组织。这种人反映出对参加社会主义劳动认识不足，我感到这种人，需要民建、工商联，在各级党委的领导下，协助妇联多作些具体工作，要她们投入光荣的生产劳动中去，从事自所能及的劳动，通过劳动彻底解放自己，改造自己。
    各位代表，我们听到李富春、李先念、谭震林三位副总理的报告后，受到很大的启发教育，这三个报告给我们增强了信心和力量。作为一位民主党派成员来说，我今后一定要在党的领导下，围绕党的中心任务，积极服务，加强改造，认清形势掌握命运，“顾一头、一边倒”，永远听党的话，党指向哪里，就作到哪里，让我们大家为完成和超额完成1960年国民经济计划而奋勇前进吧！
