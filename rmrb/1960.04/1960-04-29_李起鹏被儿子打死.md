Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 28th: Seoul dispatch: Li Qipeng, the number two figure in the Li Seung-man clique, was shot dead by his own son, Li Kangshi, with a pistol this morning. Li Kangshi was also Li Seung-man's adopted son.

According to the Dongyang News Agency, Li Qipeng, fearing punishment by the angry South Korean uprising people, recently fled with his family into Li Seung-man's residence, the Gyeongmudae.

It is reported that Li Kangshi also committed suicide after killing his father, mother, and younger brother. Li Qipeng was Li Seung-man's main accomplice and the chairman of the Central Committee of the Liberal Party. In the so-called "Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election" held on March 15 this year, he was "elected" as "Vice-President" through fraudulent means. His death reflects that the Li Seung-man clique has fallen into a state of extreme chaos and despair under the strong impact of the South Korean people's angry tide.

    李起鹏被儿子打死
    新华社平壤28日电　汉城消息：李承晚集团的第二号头目李起鹏今天早晨被他亲生儿子李康石用手枪打死。李康石也是李承晚的养子。
    据东洋通讯社报道，李起鹏害怕愤怒的南朝鲜起义人民惩办他，最近携带家属逃进了李承晚的住所——景武台。
    据报道，李康石在打死他的父亲、母亲和弟弟以后也自杀了。李起鹏是李承晚的主要帮凶，自由党中央委员会议长，他在今年3月15日举行的所谓“正、副总统选举”中，用舞弊手段“当选”为“副总统”。他的死，反映了李承晚集团已在南朝鲜人民怒潮的强烈冲击下陷于极端混乱和绝望的状态中。
