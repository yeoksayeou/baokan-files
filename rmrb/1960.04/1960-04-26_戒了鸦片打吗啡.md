    Giving up Opium for Morphine

    British Defense Minister Watkinson recently announced the decision to abandon the "Blue Streak" ballistic missile program, which was once touted as the main weapon of Britain's "deterrent policy."

    If this decision by the British government means that it is abandoning its nuclear armament policy out of consideration for the wishes of the British people, it is certainly welcome to the British people. Because doing so not only helps to reduce the threat of nuclear war to a certain extent, but Britain's cessation of the costly arms race will undoubtedly help to improve Britain's hard-pressed economy. Britain has already spent 65 million pounds on the "Blue Streak" missile in pursuit of this weapon, and it will need to invest another 500 million pounds or more to complete the plan.

    But that's not the case. British officials claim that abandoning the "Blue Streak" missile does not mean abandoning the "sacred pillar" of "nuclear deterrence." Britain plans to purchase American "Skybolt" air-launched ballistic missiles.

    The British ruling group's pursuit of the so-called "nuclear deterrent" was originally an act of overreach. According to British newspapers, Britain abandoned the development of the "Blue Streak" missile because it could no longer financially support the huge cost of producing such missiles. Britain's decision to replace its own development of the "Blue Streak" missile with the purchase of American "Skybolt" missiles does not necessarily save much money. The United States is clearly not going to do unprofitable business, especially when it is a "rare commodity." British newspapers pointed out that if Britain cannot afford the "Blue Streak" missile, it also cannot afford the American "Polaris" and "Skybolt" missiles that are expected to replace the "Blue Streak." Moreover, Britain's reliance on the United States is as unreliable as its own development of the "Blue Streak" missile. The American "Skybolt" missile that Britain hopes to purchase is still just a pipe dream and its birth is nowhere in sight. As British Labor MP Brown said: "The 'Skybolt' missile is a missile that has not yet been born, and no one knows whether it will be born."

    The British government's actions, however, are exactly what the United States wants. The United States has always hoped that Britain would follow its war policy, but it is unwilling for Britain to develop its own "nuclear deterrent" because such a force may not have any "deterrent" effect on the socialist camp, but it is a considerable threat to the United States' leadership in the "free world." One of the main purposes of Britain's efforts in this area is to raise its status in the struggle for leadership in the West. Now that Britain has decided to change course, how can Washington not applaud it? Therefore, when Britain announced its abandonment of the "Blue Streak" missile, the United States praised it greatly on the one hand, expressing its willingness to sell the "Skybolt" missile that will be produced in the future to Britain; on the other hand, it was complacent and showed Britain a "big boss" face. "U.S. News & World Report" wrote triumphantly: "London is gradually and reluctantly recognizing this: Britain is no longer able to play ball with the United States and Russia. Britain's defense is increasingly dependent on its allies, especially the United States." Since the British ruling group has to ask for help from others, it can only swallow its anger at such disrespectful words from Washington.

    What is particularly interesting is that, according to the British official explanation, the reason why Britain decided to abandon the development of the "Blue Streak" missile is because this missile can only be launched from fixed launch sites, and therefore is vulnerable to attack. Even if Britain buys the American "Skybolt" missile launched from the air, will Britain be able to change its fate of being attacked? As long as Britain follows the United States' war policy and uses its territory as a nuclear war base for the United States, then once a war breaks out, the small British Isles will inevitably be a fixed "war target." British newspapers also believe that the British bases where bombers carrying "Skybolt" missiles can operate can easily be leveled by Soviet missiles or aircraft once a war begins. It can be seen that this modification of its "nuclear deterrent policy" by the British ruling group is just replacing opium with morphine, and the harm to the British people has not been reduced at all. The only difference is that Britain is more firmly tied to the American chariot.

    戒了鸦片打吗啡
    英国国防大臣沃金森最近宣布决定放弃发展曾经被吹嘘为英国“威慑政策”的主要武器的“蓝光”弹道导弹计划。
    英国政府的这一决定，如果是意味着它由于考虑到英国人民的愿望而放弃了它的核军备政策，那诚然是值得英国人民欢迎的。因为这样做不仅在一定程度上有助于减少核战争的威胁，而且英国停止耗费不资的军备竞赛，无疑有助于困难重重的英国经济的改善。英国为了追求这种武器，已经在“蓝光”导弹上花了六千五百万英镑，而要完成这个计划，还需要再投下五亿英镑以上的巨款。
    但是事情并不是这样。英国官员声称，放弃“蓝光”导弹并非放弃“核威慑力量”这一“神圣支柱”。英国打算购买美国的“闪电”式由空中发射的弹道导弹。
    英国统治集团追求所谓“核威慑力量”，本来就是一种不自量力的举动，据英国报纸说，英国放弃发展“蓝光”导弹，是因为在财政上已无力支持生产这类导弹的巨大费用。英国现在决定用向美国购买“闪电”式导弹来代替自己发展“蓝光”导弹，也不见得就能省多少钱，美国显然是不会做不赚钱的生意的，何况是“奇货可居”，英国报纸就指出，如果英国造不起“蓝光”式导弹，它同样也买不起预料要代替“蓝光”的美国“北极星”式和“闪电”式导弹。而且英国对美国的这种依靠是同它自己发展“蓝光”导弹一样靠不住的。英国期望购买的美国“闪电”式导弹，现在还只是纸上谈兵，诞生无日。正如英国工党议员布朗所说：“‘闪电’式导弹是一种还没有出世的导弹，还没有人知道，它是否会出世。”
    英国政府这样做却正中美国的下怀。美国一向希望英国追随它的战争政策，但是不愿英国发展自己的“核威慑力量”，因为这样一种力量，对于社会主义阵营不见得有什么“威慑”作用，而对于美国在“自由世界”的领导权却是一个不小的威胁。英国在这方面的努力，其中一个主要的目的，正是在提高自己在争夺西方领导权的斗争的地位。英国现在决定改弦易辙，华盛顿方面怎能不拍手欢迎呢？因此当英国一宣布放弃发展“蓝光”导弹，美国就一方面大加赞赏，表示愿意把将来生产出来的“闪电”式导弹卖给英国；另一方面则踌躇满志，向英国摆出一副“大头目”的面孔。“美国新闻与世界报道”得意洋洋地写道：“伦敦方面还正在逐渐地、并不甘心情愿地认识到这一点：英国不再能够同美国和俄国一起赛球了。英国的防务日益依赖它的盟国，特别是美国。”英国统治集团既然有求于人，对于华盛顿方面的这种不逊之言，显然也只好忍气吞声。
    特别有意思的是：据英国官方的解释，英国所以决定放弃发展“蓝光”导弹，是因为这种导弹只能从固定的发射场发射，因而容易遭到攻击。英国即使买到了由空中发射的美国“闪电”式导弹，英国是否就能够改变它被攻击的命运呢？只要英国追随美国的战争政策，把领土充当美国的核战争基地，那末一旦发生战争，小小的英伦三岛总无可避免地是一个固定的“战争靶子”。英国的报纸也认为：载运“闪电”式导弹的轰炸机能够活动的英国基地，一旦战争开始就能容易为苏联导弹或飞机夷平。可见英国统治集团对于它的“核威慑政策”的这种修改，不过是用吗啡代替鸦片，对于英国人民的危害丝毫没有减轻，所不同的是把英国更牢地绑在美国的战车上。
