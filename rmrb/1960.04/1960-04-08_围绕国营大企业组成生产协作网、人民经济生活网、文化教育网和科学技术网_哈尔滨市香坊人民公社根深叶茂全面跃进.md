Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 7th: Since its establishment in September 1958, the Xiangfang People's Commune in Harbin, centered on the Harbin Bearing Factory, a large state-owned enterprise in the Xiangfang District of Harbin, has organized all aspects of the district, from large factories to small and medium-sized factories, from factories to streets, from workers to residents, and from industry to agriculture, promoting a great leap forward in production and liberating female labor.

The Xiangfang People's Commune was born in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in production in August 1958. During the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production at that time, the production tasks of the Harbin Bearing Factory were continuously increased six times, from the annual production plan of 6.4 million sets set at the beginning of the year to 15 million sets. By the end of August of that year, 52% of the tasks had not been completed. The biggest contradiction was the shortage of labor. At the same time, due to the rapid development of production, the original cooperation and supporting relations with factories in other places were far from meeting the needs of production. These problems had to be solved quickly, and it was difficult to find so much labor in the factory at once, and there were many difficulties in producing a large number of parts. On the other hand, with the victory of the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of family women has generally improved, and they are eager to get rid of the tedious housework and participate in social production. In this case, the Harbin Bearing Factory organized the "Family Production Service Cooperative" of the family members of the workers to produce auxiliary production for the factory; it also established the "Artisan School" to absorb some local residents to participate in part-time work and part-time study, but it still could not completely solve the problem. Then, the Party Committee of the Bearing Factory and the Party Committee of Xiangfang District brewed to try to run a "Bearing Street" to organize the residents of several streets around the Bearing Factory to serve the factory. It happened that Chairman Mao put forward the great call of "People's Communes are good," and the people in this district were very happy and believed that since people's communes could be run in rural areas, urban people's communes could also be run according to the characteristics of the city. According to the needs of the Great Leap Forward and the demands of the masses, the Party Committee of Xiangfang District began to prepare for the trial run of the Xiangfang People's Commune from the end of August. The news spread like spring thunder to the streets and alleys of Xiangfang District, and people were overjoyed and rushed to tell each other, asking to join the commune. Street residents automatically connected with each other, set up factories in a big way, and vigorously set up collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries to greet the establishment of the People's Commune with practical actions. In this way, the first urban people's commune in Heilongjiang Province, the Xiangfang People's Commune in Harbin, was officially established on September 27, 1958.

In the year or so since the establishment of the Xiangfang People's Commune, it has not only taken root in the hearts of the masses, but has also embarked on a sound development path. The broad masses of commune members, whether workers, peasants, or street residents, have shown infinite love for the commune. They describe their relationship with the commune as: "Tied together, connected into pieces, never separated forever." People sing the praises of this commune, saying: "Chairman Mao built a happy stage, and the working people came up, the mountains are there, the water is there, the stones are there, and poverty will never come again." Once established, the Xiangfang People's Commune has shown great superiority in promoting the Great Leap Forward in production and development, liberating female labor, improving the people's cultural and scientific and technological level and material life, and with the development of the commune, it has gradually formed four networks within the whole commune: production collaboration network, people's economic life network, cultural education network and science and technology network.

Xiangfang is a new industrial area in Harbin. There were general collaborative relationships between the eighteen state-owned factories and local state-owned factories here. However, before the establishment of the commune, the collaboration between factories was decentralized and not frequent. With the Great Leap Forward in production, the collaborative products needed by various factories and enterprises, both in terms of quantity and variety, became more and more, and the original general collaborative relationship could no longer meet the needs of the development of the situation. Once the commune was established, the decentralized external collaboration between factories in the past became organized, led, and regular large-scale collaboration within the commune. A large number of newly established commune-run factories are organized to process auxiliary production parts for large factories, and use the side materials and waste materials of large factories to produce various daily necessities needed by people's lives to make up for the deficiencies of large industries. Large factories also enthusiastically support commune-run factories, and gradually formed a production collaboration network that closely integrates large, medium, and small enterprises, solving the auxiliary production collaboration problems of large factories, and making it possible to process many parts that originally needed to be processed in remote foreign countries locally. In order to ensure the Great Leap Forward of key factories, the commune adopted the method of close integration of large, medium, and small enterprises, and reorganized and merged the hundreds of small factories that were established into twenty-nine factories such as casting, machinery, metal, and riveting and welding, which were respectively linked with large factories to process various parts for large factories.

The result of the commune's organization of large-scale production collaboration within the commune and the whole party and the whole people to ensure the key points is that a hot and bustling scene and a comprehensive leap forward in production has appeared in the commune. The production of Harbin Bearing Factory in 1958 doubled and a half compared with 1957, and in 1959, it overfulfilled the state plan sixty-two days ahead of schedule. In the first quarter of this year, the Bearing Factory overfulfilled the production plan ten days ahead of schedule. The new industrial production of the commune has also risen sharply, and the quality and quantity of production have increased exponentially. All the factories, large and small, in the whole commune have overfulfilled the plan month after month and quarter after quarter since the establishment of the commune. In 1959, the total industrial output value increased by 62% compared with 1958, and in the first quarter of this year, it realized a complete victory twenty-three days ahead of schedule.

In the comprehensive leap forward in production, a large number of female workers in the Xiangfang People's Commune, who were still housewives a year ago, have rapidly improved their business and technical level due to diligent study and have become an important force on various production fronts. For example, the new technical workers in the electric repair, casting, and polishing jobs of the Bearing Factory were originally housewives, and now they can basically operate independently. With the development of production and the employment of the broad masses of family women, the living standards of commune members have been significantly improved. According to a survey of 8,330 households and 19,201 people in Anbu Street, the income of commune members in 1959 increased by 28.6% compared with before the establishment of the commune. Due to the improvement of living standards, people's cultural life has become more colorful.

Due to the great development of production, tens of thousands of family members of workers and street women happily participated in social production. The contradiction between collective production and decentralized individual life made them eager to be organized in terms of life, and asked to vigorously set up public canteens, nurseries and life service stations. According to the demands of the masses, the commune established 346 public canteens, 266 nurseries and kindergartens, and more than 300 life service stations and service groups in the dormitories of workers' families and residential courtyards. More than 3,100 service personnel replaced the housework of more than 10,000 housewives. In this way, a criss-crossing network of organizing people's economic life was formed throughout the commune. This people's economic life network takes state-owned commerce and service industries as the backbone and organizes the commune's public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and service stations.

After tens of thousands of family members of workers and street women took up production posts and participated in social labor, they were eager to learn culture; at the same time, the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation also made the broad masses of workers demand to rapidly improve their cultural and technical level. The large-scale establishment of collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and service stations enabled female workers to go to spare-time schools to study culture and science and technology without worries after get off work every day. According to the demands of the workers, the Xiangfang People's Commune mobilized the masses to set up 51 spare-time schools of various levels and types, so that 86% of the workers participated in the study. The commune's members not only participate in cultural studies, but also organize various scientific research groups and societies to carry out scientific research activities. Now, the whole commune has established 21 scientific research institutes and dozens of scientific research associations, with more than 3,000 scientific research association members, from various large and medium-sized factories to street residents' committees. Last year, the commune completed a total of 109 scientific research projects. Now the science and technology network of this commune is rapidly forming.

After all the members of the Xiangfang People's Commune were organized from production to life, their socialist ideological consciousness was raised to an unprecedented level. The female workers who were still housewives more than a year ago have not only joined the trade union, but many have also joined the Communist Youth League, and some have even submitted applications to join the Party. The broad masses of commune members are eager to improve their political and theoretical level. Recently, a high tide of studying Marxist-Leninist theory centered on Chairman Mao's works has been vigorously launched throughout the commune. The commune members have been tempered in collective production and collective life, and their mental outlook has undergone significant changes. A new social atmosphere of everyone working, caring for each other, loving the collective, and harmonious neighborhood has emerged throughout the commune. When the workers go to work, the service personnel of the life service station sew and mend their clothes, take care of the sick, and beautify their families. The workers entrust all their housework to the service station, and the service personnel also do their best to serve the workers. A communist-style comrade relationship has been formed between people.

While the Xiangfang People's Commune is making a great leap forward in industrial production, it has implemented the policy of taking vegetables and meat as the key link and serving the city in agricultural production. Due to the development of regular industrial and agricultural cooperation, the face of agricultural production in the suburbs has undergone great changes. Now, the agricultural brigades of this commune have basically realized mechanized farming and mechanized non-field operations with industrial support. Industry has helped agriculture establish 50,000 square meters of greenhouses, which is equal to 1.3 times the total area of greenhouses built in Harbin in the past 60 years. Recently, the rural areas of this commune, with the support of industry, have built an automatic pig-raising line, and the entire process from feed crushing to manure removal has been mechanized. In this way, one breeder can raise 3,000 pigs, which guarantees the development of six 10,000-pig farms in this commune. Now, this commune has established a 10,000-square-meter mushroom farm, and is also preparing to build 10,000-chicken farms, 10,000-duck bays, 10,000-square-meter cold storage, 10,000-square-meter vegetable cellars, 100,000-square-meter greenhouses, and 3 million potted vegetables. These, which people call the ten "100,000" movement, are being vigorously carried out in the countryside with industrial support.

Now, the Xiangfang People's Commune is using its superiority of being large in scale and public in nature to develop the collectivization of production to a higher degree.

    据新华社哈尔滨7日电　以哈尔滨市香坊区的国营大企业哈尔滨轴承厂为中心组织起来的城市人民公社——哈尔滨市香坊人民公社，从1958年9月举办以来，已经把全区的大厂和中小厂、工厂和街道、职工和居民、工业和农业等各个方面，从生产到生活，全部组织起来，促进了生产的大跃进，解放了妇女劳动力。
    香坊人民公社是在1958年8月生产大跃进的高潮中诞生的。在当时的工农业生产大跃进中，哈尔滨轴承厂的生产任务连续增加六次，由年初订的年生产计划六百四十万套增加到一千五百万套，到这一年8月底，还有52％的任务没有完成。时间短，任务重，最大的矛盾是劳动力不足。同时，因生产发展太快，原来与外地工厂的协作配套关系也远远不能满足生产的需要。这些问题都必须迅速解决，而自己工厂中一时又找不到这样多的劳动力，生产大量配件也有许多困难。另一方面，随着整风运动和反右派斗争的胜利，广大家庭妇女的社会主义觉悟普遍提高，她们迫切要求摆脱繁琐的家务劳动，参加社会生产。在这种情况下，哈尔滨轴承厂就组织职工家属成立了“家属生产服务社”，为工厂作辅助性的生产；又成立“艺工学校”，吸收当地一部分居民参加半工半读，但仍不能完全解决问题。接着，中共轴承厂党委和中共香坊区委就酝酿试办一条“轴承大街”，把轴承厂周围几条街的居民都组织起来为这个厂服务。恰好那时毛主席提出了“还是人民公社好”的伟大号召，这个区的人民群众十分高兴，认为既然在农村可以办人民公社，也就可以根据城市的特点办城市人民公社。中共香坊区委根据大跃进的需要和群众的要求，就从8月下旬开始筹备试办香坊人民公社，这个消息像春雷一样传遍了香坊区的大街小巷，人们欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告，纷纷要求入社。街道居民自动串连，大办工厂，大办公共食堂、托儿所等集体福利事业，用实际行动迎接人民公社的建立。就这样，黑龙江省第一个城市人民公社——哈尔滨市香坊人民公社就在1958年9月27日正式成立。
    香坊人民公社成立一年多来，不仅在群众的心中扎下了根，而且已走上了健全发展的道路。广大社员——不管是职工、农民还是街道居民，对公社都表现了无限的热爱，他们把自己同公社的关系说成是：“打成帮，连成片，永远分不散”。人们歌颂这个公社说：“毛主席搭了幸福台，劳动人民走上来，山在水在石头在，穷苦一去不再来。”香坊人民公社一经建立，便在促进生产大跃进、大发展、解放妇女劳动力、提高人民的文化科学技术水平和物质生活等方面，显示出了巨大的优越性，并且随着公社的发展，逐步在全社范围内形成了四网：生产协作网、人民经济生活网、文化教育网和科学技术网。
    香坊是哈尔滨新兴的工业区，这里的十八个国营工厂和地方国营工厂之间原来就有一般的协作关系。但在成立公社前，厂与厂之间的协作是分散的、不经常的。随着生产大跃进，各工厂企业所需要的协作产品，无论数量和品种都越来越多，原来一般的协作关系已不能满足形势发展的需要。公社一成立，过去厂与厂之间那种分散的外部协作变成了公社内部有组织、有领导、经常性的大协作。大批兴办起来的社办工厂，都组织起来为大厂加工辅助性生产配件，和利用大厂的边材余料，生产人民生活需要的各种日用品，弥补大工业的不足，各大工厂也热情地扶植社办工厂，并逐步形成了大中小企业密切结合的生产协作网，解决了各大厂的辅助性生产的协作问题，使许多原来需要到千里迢迢的外地去加工的配件在当地就能加工。公社为了保证重点工厂的大跃进，采取大中小企业密切结合的办法，把兴办起来的几百个小工厂加以整顿合并成为翻砂、机械、金属、铆焊等二十九个工厂，分别同大厂挂钩，为大厂加工各种配件。
    公社组织社内生产大协作和全党全民保重点的结果，使公社内出现了一片热气腾腾、生产全面大跃进的局面。哈尔滨轴承厂1958年生产比1957年翻了一倍半，1959年又提前六十二天超额完成国家计划。今年第一季度轴承厂又提前十天超额完成了生产计划。公社的新办工业生产也扶摇直上，产质产量成倍增长。全社大大小小的工厂，从建社以来月月季季超额完成计划，1959年工业总产值比1958年提高62％，今年第一季度又提前二十三天实现了满堂红。
    在生产全面大跃进中，香坊人民公社大批在一年以前还是家庭妇女的女职工，由于勤学苦钻，迅速提高了业务技术水平，已经成为各个生产战线上的一支重要力量。像轴承厂的电修、翻砂、磨光等工种中的新技术工人，原来都是家庭妇女，现在基本上能独立操作了。随着生产的发展和广大家庭妇女就业，社员的生活水平有了显著提高，据安埠街八千三百三十户，一万九千二百零一人的调查，1959年社员收入比建社前提高28.6％，由于生活水平的提高，人们的文化生活也更加丰富多彩了。
    由于生产大发展，成千成万的职工家属和街道妇女喜笑颜开地参加了社会生产。集体生产和分散个体生活的矛盾使他们迫切要求从生活上也组织起来，要求大办公共食堂、托儿所和生活服务站。根据群众的要求，公社在职工家属宿舍和居民大院兴办起了公共食堂三百四十六个，托儿所、幼儿园二百六十六个，生活服务站和服务组三百多个。有三千一百多名服务员代替了一万多名家庭妇女的家务劳动。这样就在全社范围内形成了一个纵横交错的组织人民经济生活网。这个人民经济生活网以国营商业和服务行业为骨干，把公社的公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、服务站都组织了起来。
    成千上万的职工家属和街道妇女走上生产岗位，参加社会劳动以后，迫切要求学习文化；同时，以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动的蓬勃开展，也使广大职工要求迅速提高文化技术水平。而公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、服务站等集体福利事业的大量兴办，就使女职工们每天下班以后可以没有牵挂地到业余学校去学习文化和科学技术。根据职工们的要求，香坊人民公社发动群众办起了各级各类业余学校五十一所，使86％的职工都参加了学习。公社的社员不仅参加文化学习，而且组织了各种科学研究小组和学会，进行科学研究活动。现在，全社从各个大中工厂到街道居民委员会，已经成立了二十一个科学研究所，几十个科学研究协会，拥有三千多名科学研究协会会员。去年一年，这个公社共完成了一百零九项科学研究项目。现在这个公社的科学技术网正在迅速形成中。
    香坊人民公社的广大社员，从生产到生活全部组织起来以后，社会主义思想觉悟空前提高，在一年多以前还是家庭妇女的女职工们，现在不仅加入了工会，很多人还参加了共青团，有些人还提出了入党的申请。广大社员迫切要求提高自己的政治理论水平，最近全社又轰轰烈烈地掀起了学习以毛主席著作为中心的马列主义理论学习的高潮。社员们在集体生产、集体生活中得到锻炼，精神面貌有了显著变化。全社出现了人人劳动，互相关心，热爱集体，邻里和睦的社会新风尚。职工们去上班了，生活服务站的服务员们，就为他们缝补拆洗衣服，照看病人，美化家庭。职工们把全部家务都委托给服务站，而服务员也竭尽全力为职工服务。在人与人之间形成了共产主义式的同志关系。
    香坊人民公社在工业生产大跃进的同时，在农业生产方面贯彻了以菜肉为纲、为城市服务的方针。由于开展了经常性的工农大协作，使郊区农业生产面貌发生了很大变化。现在，这个社的农业大队在工业支援下已基本上实现了机耕和非田间作业机械化。工业帮助农业建立了五万平方米的温室，等于哈尔滨市过去六十年来所建暖室总面积的一点三倍。最近这个公社的农村在工业支援下，已经制成了一条养猪自动线，从饲料粉碎直到粪便的清除，全部过程实现了机械化作业，这样，一个饲养员可养猪三千口，使这个公社发展六个万猪场有了保证。现在，这个公社已经建立了万米（平方米，下同）蘑菇场，还准备兴建万鸡场、万鸭湾、万米冷库、万米菜窖，十万米温室和三百万个盆菜。这些被人们称为十个“十万”运动，正在工业支援下，在农村里轰轰烈烈开展起来。
    现在，香坊人民公社正在以它那一大二公的优越性，使这个公社生产集体化向着更高的程度发展。
