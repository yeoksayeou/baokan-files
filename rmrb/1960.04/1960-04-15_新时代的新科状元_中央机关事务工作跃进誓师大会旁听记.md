    New Era's Top Graduates
    ——Notes from the Central Government机关事务 Work Leap Forward Swearing-in Conference	Our Correspondent
    Nearly five thousand advanced individuals from the central government in areas of 机关事务 work entered the solemn Great Hall of the People to hold a Leap Forward Swearing-in Conference. Among them were cooks, childcare workers, car drivers, receptionists, telephone operators, mail clerks, typists, barbers, and so on. In the old society, these jobs were seen as lowly, but today their labor is called noble labor, the new era's top graduates.
    Cooks Who Consider the Diners in Every Way
    "The cafeteria is well-run, the food is fragrant and filling; everything is satisfactory, with many varieties; the colors, aromas, and flavors in the dishes show tireless hard work day and night; thank the cooks, thank the Party's leadership."
    This is a hymn of praise from the masses for the cafeteria, a tribute and high evaluation of the cooks' hard work. Zheng Yuming, an excellent chef from the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and cafeteria workers Zhang Keming and Wu Zhaorui stated in their speeches that these ordinary workers are engaged in extraordinary undertakings. Zhang Keming, the head of the Foreign Trade Ministry cafeteria professional group, mentioned in his speech that in just thirty days, the Foreign Trade Ministry cafeteria has achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization in eighty-seven aspects of cooking, from kneading dough, rinsing rice, making dumplings, and steaming buns to washing and cutting vegetables, scaling fish, and washing dishes, increasing work efficiency several to dozens of times. Zheng Yuming, a chef at the Baoguosi cafeteria of the Ministry of Food, talked about their implementation of the grain increase method, which not only saves a lot of grain but also allows comrades to eat their fill and eat well. He said that the Baoguosi cafeteria has six hundred people eating, and the implementation of the grain increase method can save more than 1,000 jin of grain per month. At the same time, after scientific identification, the retention rate of protein, carbohydrates, and fats in the staple food using the increase method is higher than that of the old method, which is very good for human nutrition. Wu Zhaorui, a cafeteria worker from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, talked about the creativity and communist spirit of their cooks. Many cooks working in this cafeteria, regardless of the nature of their work, the hours they work, or the remuneration, engage in selfless labor. They truly "consider the diners in every way," making more of what the masses like to eat and making it often; making light food in the summer and soup-based, cold-resistant food in the winter; "delivering food to the door for single patients; and proactively taking care of chronic patients." As long as the work requires, they come early to eat early, come late to eat late, and heat up the food when it's cold. They serve the collective wholeheartedly, trying every means to do a good job in the cafeteria, using coarse grains and vegetables to make more than 500 kinds of staple and non-staple food, and reforming more than 50 pieces of cooking equipment. The chemical industry department's机关食堂 built a gas generator after 15 days of hard work and came to report the good news to the conference.
    Childcare Workers Who Love Children More Than Mothers
    Childcare workers who nurture children as warmly as mothers put forward a resounding slogan at the meeting: "Love children with all our heart, be as considerate as mothers." Some childcare workers expressed their willingness to commit to childcare work for life in order to cultivate communist successors. Li Zhewang, the director of a kindergarten under the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, introduced many advanced deeds of childcare workers who love children more than mothers at the meeting. Not long after the death of the mother of a child named Ma Xuanxuan, her father was transferred to work in the Northwest. The childcare worker Cui Shumin treated her like her own daughter, taking care of her meticulously. In order to give this child who had lost her mother the warmth of maternal love, Cui Shumin even went to Xuanxuan's home on New Year's Eve to accompany her. Xuanxuan's father wrote a letter with excitement, thanking them, saying: "Although I am far away from my only daughter Xuanxuan who lost her mother, my mood is happy, because I know that your noble proletarian maternal love is taking care of the child." Because of the excellent achievements in childcare and education work, this kindergarten was rated as a red flag unit in Chaoyang District, Beijing, and an advanced unit in Beijing last year. Three people were rated as advanced workers in the city, and six people were rated as advanced workers in the district. In the first quarter of this year, it was rated as a red flag collective unit in Chaoyang District and a red flag collective unit in Beijing, and won the national "March 8th" Red Flag Collective title.
      Frugal and Careful "Housekeepers"
    A speech by a good "housekeeper," Comrade Yang Richun, was warmly welcomed. Yang Richun is a clerk at the Third Institute of the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He is frugal and careful, and tries his best to accumulate construction funds for the country. Once, the institute needed to spend forty or fifty yuan to buy a ladder. Yang Richun thought it was too expensive and decided to buy materials to make it himself. The first calculation was to spend twenty yuan, but he was not resigned to it, still thinking it was too expensive. Finally, he bought a round wooden pole, sawed it in half, and made a ladder for only six or seven yuan. Another time, two electric bells in the机关 broke. The electrician said that these things were broken and could not be repaired, and buying two would cost another twenty or thirty yuan. Yang Richun didn't believe it. He personally disassembled them to check and found that the springs were broken. He replaced the springs, and these two electric bells are still in use.
    Yang Richun said, although what we do is "small things", I know that we shoulder the important responsibility of accumulating construction funds for the country. Because of this, I usually think of ways to save money in all aspects, and even the small paper ropes used for buying things are saved up for everyone to use. In order to save more administrative management expenses, Yang Richun was determined to be an "all-purpose clerk" since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Over the past few years, he has pieced together tools from old parts, learned welding from car drivers, learned to repair water pipes and electric lights from workers, and learned installation and carpentry, and taught the technology he learned to others. Now, the equipment and utensils of this research institute are generally repaired by themselves in a timely manner when they are broken, saving a large amount of repair costs and reducing the waste of water and electricity.
        Diligent Service Personnel
    In the reception department of the Ministry of National Defense机关, there is a service worker named Wang Shufang. Her daily work is wiping, washing, serving dishes, and delivering meals, being busy from morning to night, serving the guests. This service worker not only excellently completes the tasks assigned to her by the Party, but also, in the posture of a master, takes care of other matters in the service department together with other service workers. They use all their spare time to wash towels, tablecloths, work clothes and other items. No matter how busy they are, they have persisted throughout last year and did not have a single item washed outside all year, saving the state more than 3,600 yuan. Wang Shufang herself got up at five o'clock in the morning to wash various items for 293 days last year, washing more than 17,000 pieces throughout the year. This diligent service worker has now been rated as a five-good worker by the机关 and has won the glorious title of "March 8th" Red Flag Bearer.
      Automobile Team Without Accidents for More Than Four Years
    The driver team of the Beijing Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power has won the honor of the first prize for traffic safety in Beijing for three consecutive years. This team has a total of eight drivers, and has won 15 collective awards and 11 individual awards over the years, and recently won a special award in Beijing. Comrade Wang Daoyu of this car driver team said at the meeting when introducing their experience in safe driving that it is precisely because they treat their work as a political task to complete that they have achieved very good results. Each driver in this team can recite a Four Seasons Song compiled by themselves to spur themselves on:
    "Spring is warm and flowers are fragrant, ice melts and the road is muddy; the spring breeze gradually warms and tourists are widespread, people are many and the road is slippery, be careful to prevent accidents. Summer is hot, don't doze off, concentrate on looking ahead; rainy and muddy roads are difficult to walk, slow down and give way when you see people. The autumn wind is cool and refreshing, everyone is happy, the car is full of people and busy; drive at medium speed without accidents, safe driving is guaranteed. Winter is frozen and there is frost, snow covers the ground and the wind hits the windows; the road is covered with ice armor, slippery and dangerous, the driver drives carefully."
    Not only that, they also keep in mind some driving secrets: "Be vigilant when driving on icy and snowy roads," "Don't rush, don't fight," "Three dodges are better than one stop," "Rather stop for one minute than grab one second," and so on. Because of a series of efforts made by this driver team, since 1956, there has been no accident, with safe driving of 500,000 kilometers, and a lot of gasoline has been saved.
      The Livestock Keeper Who Loves the Farm Like Home
    "It is most glorious to work for the collective and for the happiness of others." This is what Qu Dongshan, the livestock keeper of the Joint Farm of the Fifth Design Institute, Fifth Bureau, and Survey Company of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry, said in his speech. This is the source of his positive work of "loving the farm like home and treating livestock like babies." He said that the Party's education and care for me has made me more enthusiastic in my work. From morning till night, rain or shine, although the work is tense, I feel very happy. When feed is lacking, I go up the mountain to cut wild pig grass. When sows give birth, I stay in the pigsty day and night to guard them. I lack pig-raising knowledge, so I study hard. I have fallen in love with the farm and also with the pigs. Whether I get up early or go to bed late, I have to go and see the pigs, otherwise I feel uneasy.
    At the conference, these ordinary new figures all expressed their intention to muster greater efforts, display their talents in this year's continued leap forward, achieve better results, and strive for greater glory.

    新时代的新科状元
    ——中央机关事务工作跃进誓师大会旁听记	本报记者
    中央机关近五千名事务工作方面的先进人物，走进了庄严的人民大会堂，举行跃进誓师大会。他们当中有炊事员、保育员、汽车司机、招待员、电话员、收发员、打字员、理发员等等。在旧社会，这些工作被人们看成是卑贱的，可是今天他们的劳动被称为是崇高的劳动，是新时代的新科状元。	处处为吃饭人着想的炊事员
    “食堂办得好，吃得香又饱；顺心又顺意，花样真不少；盘中色香味，日夜费辛劳；感谢炊事员，感谢党领导。”
    这是群众对食堂的赞歌，对炊事员同志辛勤劳动的颂扬和崇高的评价。来自粮食部、对外贸易部和中华全国总工会的优秀厨师郑玉明，食堂工作者张克明、吴兆瑞在会上的发言表明，这些平凡的工作者正在从事不平凡的事业。对外贸易部食堂专业小组组长张克明在发言中谈到：外贸部食堂仅仅在短短三十天的时间里，从和面、淘米、包饺子、做馒头到洗菜、切菜、刮鱼鳞、洗碗等方面，已经有八十七件炊事工具实现了机械化、半机械化，使工作效率提高了几倍到十几倍。粮食部报国寺食堂厨师郑玉明谈到他们实行粮食增量法，不仅节约了许多粮食，而且能使同志们吃饱、吃好。他说，报国寺食堂有六百人吃饭，实行粮食增量法，每月可节省粮食一千多斤。同时经过科学鉴定，采用增量法后主食中的蛋白质、醣、脂肪的保存率比旧法做饭高，对人的身体营养很好。中华全国总工会食堂工作者吴兆瑞谈到他们炊事员的创造性和共产主义风格。在这个食堂工作的许多炊事员，不分工作性质，不计工作时间，不讲报酬，进行忘我的劳动。他们真是“处处为吃饭人着想”，群众爱吃的多做、常做；夏天多做清淡食品，冬天多做带汤耐冷的食品，“对单身病号，送饭上门；对慢性病号，主动照顾”。只要工作需要，早来早吃，晚来晚吃，凉了热后吃。他们一心一意为集体服务，千方百计搞好食堂工作，用粗粮素菜，做出主食和副食花样五百多种，改革炊事工具五十多件。化学工业部机关食堂经过十五天的苦战，建成了煤气发生炉，赶来向大会报喜。	  热爱孩子赛妈妈的保育员
    像妈妈一样热心地培育孩子的保育工作者，她们在会上响亮地提出口号：“一片热心爱孩子，万分体贴赛妈妈”，有的保育工作者表示，为了培养共产主义接班人，愿意决心干一辈子保育工作。石油工业部的一个幼儿园园长李哲旺在会上介绍了许多保育员热爱孩子赛妈妈的先进事迹。孩子马萱萱的母亲去世不久，她的父亲又调西北工作，保育员崔淑敏对她就像对自己的女儿一样，照顾得无微不至。为了使这个失去妈妈的孩子得到母爱的温暖，崔淑敏甚至在除夕夜也到萱萱家去陪她。萱萱的父亲怀着激动的心情来信感谢说：“我虽远离了失去母亲的唯一女儿萱萱，但我的心情是愉快的，因为我知道有你们的崇高的无产阶级母爱在照顾着孩子。”这个幼儿园由于在保教工作上创造了很好的成绩，去年被评为北京朝阳区的红旗单位和北京市的先进单位，有三人被评为市的先进工作者，六人被评为区的先进工作者，今年第一季度又被评为朝阳区的红旗集体单位和北京市的红旗集体单位，并荣获全国“三八”红旗集体的称号。	  精打细算的“管家人”
    一位好的“管家人”杨日春同志的发言，受到人们热烈的欢迎。杨日春是中国科学院历史研究所第三所的办事员，他精打细算，厉行节约，千方百计为国家积累建设资金。有一次研究所需要花四、五十元买一架梯子，杨日春嫌太贵，决定买材料自己作，第一次合计要花二十元，他不死心，仍嫌贵，最后买了一根圆木杠，锯成两半，结果只花了六、七元便做成了一架梯子。另一次，机关里有两个电铃坏了，电工说这玩艺坏了不能修，买两个又要花二、三十元。杨日春不相信，他亲自拆开来检查，发现原来是弹簧坏了，他换上了弹簧，这两个电铃至今还在用。
    杨日春说，我们虽然做的是些“小事”，但是我知道我们肩负着为国家积累建设资金的重大责任。正因为这样，我平常从各方面想办法节约，甚至每次买东西用的小纸绳，都积攒起来供大家使用。为了节省更多的行政管理费用，杨日春从1958年大跃进开始，就立志要做个“万能事务员”。几年来，他用旧零件拼凑成工具，向汽车司机学焊接，向工人学修自来水管，学修电灯，学安装，学木工，并将自己学会的技术教给别人。现在，这个研究所的设备、用具坏了，一般都能及时由自己修理，节省了很大一批修理费，而且减少了水电的浪费。	        勤劳的服务员
    国防部机关招待处有一位服务员王淑芳，每天的工作是擦擦洗洗，端菜送饭，从早忙到晚，为客人服务。这位服务员不仅出色地完成党所交给她的任务，而且还以主人翁的姿态，同其他服务员一起，细心照管服务处的其他事情。她们利用一切空余时间洗手巾、台布和工作服等用品，不管工作怎样繁忙，去年她们始终坚持下来，全年没有到外边洗一件东西，为国家节约了三千六百多元开支。王淑芳自己在去年有二百九十三天都是早晨五点多钟起床洗各种用品，全年洗了一万七千多件。这位勤劳的服务员，现在被机关评为五好工作者，并荣获“三八”红旗手的光荣称号。	  四年多没出事故的汽车班
    水利电力部北京勘测设计院司机班，连续三年获得了北京市行车安全一等奖的荣誉。这个班共有八名司机，几年来共得集体奖十五个，个人奖十一个，最近又获得北京市特等奖一个。这个汽车司机班的王道玉同志在会上介绍他们安全行车的经验时说，正由于他们把自己的工作当作一项政治任务来完成，才做出了很好的成绩。这个班的司机每人都能背熟自编的用以鞭策自己的一首四季歌：
    “春暖花开扑鼻香，解冻冰化路翻浆；春风渐暖游人广，人多路滑要预防。夏季炎热莫打盹，精神集中看前方；雨水泥泞路难走，见人减速要躲让。秋风凉爽喜洋洋，车满载来人又忙；中速行驶无事故，安全行车有保障。冬季冰封有寒霜，雪铺满地风打窗；路穿冰甲滑又险，司机驾车把心当。”
    不仅如此，他们每人还谨守这样一些行车秘诀：“冰天雪地行车警惕”，“不抢行，不斗气”，“三躲不如一停”，“宁停一分不抢一秒”，等等。这个司机班由于进行了一系列工作，从1956年以来，没有出过任何事故，安全行车五十万公里，而且节约了大量汽油。
      爱场如家的饲养员
    “为集体，为别人的幸福而工作是最光荣的”。这是第一机械工业部第五设计院、第五局和勘测公司联合农场饲养员屈东山在发言中说的。这就是他“爱场如家，待牲畜如娃娃”的积极工作的泉源。他说，党对我的教导和关怀，使我在工作中的劲头更大，从早到晚，风来雨去，工作虽然紧张，但感到非常愉快。当饲料缺乏时，我就上山打野猪草，母猪生仔，我就日夜不离猪圈守护着。我缺乏养猪常识，就苦心钻研，我爱上了农场也爱上了猪。无论早起晚睡，我都要去看看猪，否则心里就不安。
    在大会上，这些平凡的新人物，都表示要鼓足更大的干劲，在今年的持续跃进中，各显其能，做出更好的成绩，争取更大的光荣。
