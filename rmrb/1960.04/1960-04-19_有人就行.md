    With People, Anything is Possible
    Lu Li
    Last winter, Yuhu People's Commune in Gong'an County, Hubei Province, made a Great Leap Forward plan, proposing that water conservancy, manure accumulation, and pig raising should be doubled compared with previous years, and field management of summer harvest crops and diversified management should also be done simultaneously. At that time, some people worried that this plan could not be realized, because of "Yuhu's Five Nos" -- no money, no machines, etc., thinking that it was impossible to do all kinds of work more, faster, better, and more economically. In the end, was it possible or not? At that time, without a single stroke of the "eight" character or a hook of the "nine" character, no one could convince anyone. But now, the plan has been fully realized, and this commune has become one of the red flag communes in the whole county and the whole special zone. Facts speak louder than words, and those who doubted had to admit defeat.
    Since there were "Five Nos," why could they still make a leap forward? What was their most important experience? One thing is: believe in people. They understand that it doesn't matter if there is no money or machines, as long as there are people, socialism is built by people, not by money; once people use their brains and work hard, all difficulties can be overcome, and all kinds of work can be done more, faster, better, and more economically. Without money or machines for water conservancy, they mobilized the masses to engage in indigenous methods, using indigenous methods instead of foreign ones, sheep horn rollers instead of soil compactors, and drags instead of bulldozers. The daily work efficiency quickly increased from four or five cubic meters of soil to more than twenty cubic meters, reducing labor and completing water conservancy tasks ahead of schedule. ... Various tasks created the miracle of a leap forward without money or machines.
    No money and no machines are the characteristics of being "poor and blank," but it is not terrible. What is terrible is no people. People are the spirit of all things, people are the most active factor in the productive forces, and people are the real capital for building socialism. Nothing can be done without people. And what we have is people, we have more than 600 million people, and these more than 600 million people are not ordinary 600 million people, but more than 600 million people with a high degree of socialist consciousness under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. "The more people, the greater the power, the higher the enthusiasm," one person breathes a breath, and everywhere is full of enthusiasm, which can overwhelm mountains and rivers. The more people, the more wisdom, the more methods, the collective wisdom becomes "divine," one person has one idea, and when combined, it becomes a sea of wisdom. Strength plus wisdom, drive plus methods, the leap forward will surely be realized, this is the truth. Therefore, people are more valuable than anything else, people can transform everything, people can create everything, with people there is everything. The question is whether you believe in people, see things and see people, and give full play to the role of people. The comrades of Yuhu Commune, precisely because they correctly understood the role of people, believed in people, and were able to give full play to the role of people, everything has leaped forward.

    有人就行
    鲁力
    去年冬天，湖北省公安县玉湖人民公社，做了一个跃进规划，提出水利、积肥、养猪要比往年翻一番，夏收作物的田间管理、多种经营等，也要同时做好。当时有人担心这个规划不能实现，理由是“玉湖五无”——无钱无机器等，想各样工作都能办的多快好省不可能。到底可能不可能？在那个时候，“八”字未见一撇，“九”字未见一勾，谁也说服不了谁。而现在，规划全部实现了，这个公社，成了全县和全专区的红旗社之一。事实胜于雄辩，怀疑的人只好认输。
    既是“五无”，为什么还能跃进呢？他们最主要的经验是什么？有一条，就是：相信人。他们懂得，无钱无机器不要紧，只要有人就行，社会主义是人办的，不是钱办的；人一动脑筋，一鼓干劲，什么困难都能克服，样样工作都能办得多快好省。搞水利无钱无机器，他们就发动群众大搞土办法，以土代洋，羊角磙代替压土机，拖子代替推土机，日工效由四、五方土，迅速提高到二十多方，劳力减少了，还提前完成了水利任务。……各项工作就创造了无钱无机器跃进的奇迹。
    无钱无机器，这是“一穷二白”的特点，但并不可怕，可怕的是无人。人是万物之灵，人是生产力中最活跃的因素，人是建设社会主义的真正本钱。办任何事情无人不行。而我们却有的是人，我们有六亿多人，而且这六亿多人不是平平常常的六亿多人，是在中国共产党领导下有着高度社会主义觉悟的六亿多人。“人多力量大，热气高”，一人呵一口气，到处都是热气腾腾，可以气吞山河。人多智慧多，办法多，众智成“神”，一人一条计，汇合起来就成了智慧的海洋。力量加智慧，干劲加办法，跃进定实现，这是真理。所以人比什么都宝贵，人能改造一切，人能创造一切，有人就有一切。问题就看你是否相信人，见物又见人，充分发挥人的作用。玉湖公社的同志们，正是因为正确地认识了人的作用，相信人，并能充分发挥人的作用，所以一切都跃上去了。
