Successful Experiment in Extracting Petroleum from Camellia Seed Cake

A method of extracting petroleum from camellia seed cake has been successfully tested at the Comprehensive Factory of the Shuangqiao People's Commune in Qidong County, Hunan Province.

The petroleum extracted by this comprehensive factory from camellia seed cake can yield 15 jin of gasoline, 35 jin of kerosene, and 50 jin of diesel fuel per 100 jin of cake. The quality is almost the same as the gasoline and diesel fuel produced by large factories. For example, the gasoline can be used to light a lighter. The extracted residue is still a very good fertilizer.

    用桐茶枯饼提炼石油试验成功
    用桐茶枯饼提炼石油的办法，在湖南祁东县双桥人民公社综合厂试验成功。
    这个综合厂利用茶枯提炼出来的石油，每百斤可以分馏出十五斤汽油、三十五斤煤油和五十斤柴油。质量和大工厂生产的汽油、柴油差不多，如汽油入打火机内可以打出火来。提炼后的枯渣，仍然是一种很好的肥料。
