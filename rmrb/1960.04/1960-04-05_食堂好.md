    The Dining Hall is Good
    Sweeter Than Honey (Northern Shaanxi Folk Song)
    A thousand kinds of grass, ten thousand kinds of grass, none compare to the Lingzhi mushroom,
    Zhang's stove, Li's stove, none are as good as the dining hall.
    A thousand flowers, ten thousand flowers, none can beat the fragrance of the Osmanthus,
    The taste of collective life is sweeter than honey.
    A thousand stars, ten thousand stars, only the Morning Star is bright,
    The future of the public dining hall surpasses the red sun.
      Huang Biao, Yan'an County, Shaanxi

    The Moon Rises on the Branches
    The sun goes down the slope,
    The moon rises on the branches,
    Everyone runs to the dining hall,
    Some study in the east,
    Some read newspapers in the west;
    In the open space in front of the door,
    Men and women, old and young, compete to sing the praises of the dining hall.
    Zheng Beixiang, Shichang People's Commune, Qufu, Shandong

    食堂好
    甜似蜜糖（信天游）
    千种草万种草比不过灵芝草，
    张家灶李家灶都没有食堂好。
    千朵花万朵花要数那桂花香，
    集体生活的味儿香甜似蜜糖。
    千颗星万颗星唯有启明星亮，
    公共食堂的前途赛过红太阳。
      陕西延安县　黄彪
    月上树梢
    太阳下坡，
    月上树梢，
    人人都往食堂跑，
    东边念书，
    西边读报；
    门前空地上，
    男女老少争唱食堂好。
