Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 15th: Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at Rangoon Airport today. The full text is as follows: Respected Prime Minister U Nu, dear Burmese friends:

　　I am very honored and happy to have the opportunity to visit our friendly neighbor again during the Burmese people's New Year celebration. I sincerely thank His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu and former Prime Minister General Ne Win for their kind invitation, and thank the Burmese friends for their warm welcome to us. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in my own name and that of Deputy Premier Chen Yi, to express our cordial greetings to the Burmese government and people. I wish you a happy New Year, national prosperity, and people's happiness!

　　In the three years since my last visit to Burma, thanks to the joint efforts of both parties, the friendly relations between our two countries have been developing smoothly, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence jointly advocated by our two countries have stood the test of time. What particularly pleases us is that, not long ago, during the Chinese people's Spring Festival, former Burmese Prime Minister General Ne Win visited China. During the visit, our two countries signed the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on the boundary issue between the two countries, providing a new example for the friendly unity of Asian countries and once again demonstrating the great vitality of the Five Principles. We Asian countries, who have suffered greatly from colonialist aggression and have only recently gained independence, are in urgent need of maintaining peace in Asia and the world and strengthening friendly cooperation with each other in order to concentrate our efforts on domestic peaceful construction. I believe that, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, continuing to work together, we will certainly be able to make more contributions to the cause of strengthening Asian unity and maintaining world peace.

　　Respected Prime Minister, dear friends! The people of our two countries are relatives, are "Pauk Phaws," and now it is the Burmese New Year. According to Chinese custom, visiting relatives during the New Year symbolizes auspiciousness. I hope that this visit of ours will further consolidate and develop our traditional friendship.

　　Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 15th: Burmese Prime Minister U Nu delivered a welcome speech when Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai arrived at Rangoon Airport today. The full text is as follows: Mr. Prime Minister,

　　Please allow me, on behalf of the people and government of the Union of Burma, to extend a very warm welcome to you and your entourage. We welcome you as an old friend, whose great contribution to Sino-Burmese friendship and understanding has been recorded in history, and your arrival in this festive season is a very gratifying omen for the further beneficial development of Sino-Burmese friendship and understanding.

　　I am particularly pleased that you have kindly accepted my suggestion to come a day earlier than your original itinerary in order to celebrate our Water Festival with us. I realize that this is not an easy thing to do. Please allow me to express my deep gratitude on behalf of the Burmese people for this very friendly and amiable gesture. True friends and neighbors always gather together on festive occasions, so I am pleased that we are showing that this is the case between nations as it is between individuals.

　　Mr. Prime Minister, please allow me to express my hope that you and your friends will feel completely at home during your stay in our country. As for us, it would be our honor to be able to assure you that you will feel completely happy and interested while you are with us, so if there is anything in the itinerary that you would like to do or see that is not listed, you only need to express your wish and it will be done.

    周恩来总理和吴努总理在机场上发表讲话
    互祝中缅友谊进一步巩固和发展
    新华社仰光15日电　周恩来总理今天在仰光机场上的讲话。全文如下：尊敬的吴努总理阁下，亲爱的缅甸朋友们：
    在缅甸人民欢度新年的时候，我有机会再一次访问我们的友好邻邦，感到十分荣幸和高兴。我衷心地感谢吴努总理阁下和前总理奈温将军阁下的盛情邀请，感谢缅甸朋友们对我们的热烈欢迎。请允许我代表中国政府和人民，并且用我本人和陈毅副总理的名义向缅甸政府和人民表示亲切的问候。祝贺你们新年快乐、国家繁荣、人民幸福！
    自从我上次访问缅甸以来的三年多的时间内，由于双方的共同努力，我们两国的友好关系一直在顺利地发展着，我们两国共同倡导的和平共处五项原则经受了时间的考验。特别使我们高兴的是，不久以前，在中国人民欢度春节的时候，缅甸前总理奈温将军阁下访问了中国，在访问期间，我们两国签订了中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和两国关于边界问题的协定，为亚洲国家的友好团结提供了新的范例，再一次显示了五项原则的伟大生命力。我们饱尝殖民主义侵略的祸害、取得独立不久的亚洲国家，都迫切需要维护亚洲和世界的和平，加强相互之间的友好合作，以便集中力量从事国内和平建设。我相信，在和平共处五项原则的基础上，继续共同努力，我们一定能够对加强亚洲团结和维护世界和平的事业作出更多的贡献。
    尊敬的总理阁下，亲爱的朋友们！我们两国人民是亲戚，是“胞波”，现在又是缅甸的新年，按照中国的习惯，在新年期间拜访亲戚，象征着吉利。我希望，我们这一次的访问，将使我们的传统友谊得到进一步的巩固和发展。
    中缅友好万岁！
    新华社仰光15日电　缅甸总理吴努今天在中国总理周恩来到达仰光机场时致欢迎词，全文如下：总理先生，
    请允许我代表缅甸联邦人民和政府向您和您的随行人员表示十分热烈的欢迎。我们把您作为一个老朋友来欢迎，您对中缅友谊和谅解所作出的伟大贡献已经载入史册，而您在这个节日的季节到达，对中缅友谊和谅解的进一步有益的发展，是一个十分可喜的预兆。
    我特别感到高兴，因为您惠然接受我的建议，那就是请您比您的原订行程提早一天前来，以便同我们一起庆祝我们的泼水节。我认识到，这不是容易的事情。请允许我代表缅甸人民对这种十分友好和和蔼的表示表达我的深切的谢意。真正的朋友和邻居在节日的时际总是要聚在一起的，因此我感到高兴，我们正在表明在国家之间就像在个人之间一样都是这样。
    总理先生，请允许我表示希望，您和您的朋友们在我国逗留期间完全像在家里一样。至于我们，能够保证你们同我们在一起的时候完全感到愉快和有兴趣，那将是我们感到荣幸的事，因此，如果日程中没有列入你们希望做的或者希望看的，你们只要表示你们的愿望，就可以照办。
