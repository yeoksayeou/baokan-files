    U.S. Chief Representative to Disarmament Conference is Actually an Arms Dealer

    Editor's Note: An article by Pearson in the "Washington Post" on March 30th revealed that Eaton, the chief representative of the U.S. delegation to the Disarmament Conference, was originally the boss of an arms company. The article admits that the U.S. sending Eaton to hold such a position shows that the U.S. does not want to negotiate disarmament issues seriously. The following is an excerpt from the article:

    The man Eisenhower chose to lead the U.S. disarmament delegation in Geneva is a Wall Street lawyer with absolutely no diplomatic training—Frederick Eaton. Eaton has held several minor government positions, such as wartime production advisor and member of the Joint Raw Materials Board. In addition, there is a little-known chapter in Eaton's background. Eaton is a lawyer for the directors of Monsanto Chemical Company. This company is the contractor operating the Atomic Energy Commission's Mound Laboratory in Miamisburg, Ohio. It is said that Monsanto Chemical Company is also a defense contractor for the Atomic Energy Commission, although these contracts are confidential.

    Monsanto Chemical Company has made Eaton very wealthy. If you don't mind the trouble of looking at Monsanto's records and its securities and securities transaction fees, you will find that as of December 31, 1959, Eaton owned a total of 1,621 shares of Monsanto stock, worth approximately $80,000, all of which were gifts. He received 500 shares for free in 1955, and another 1,000 shares in the 1955 stock split, and then received a smaller number of shares in each annual stock split.

    You will also find that the value of this stock began to rise after the Eisenhower administration came to power. In 1952, the last year of Truman's administration, net sales were $77,904,787. In 1955, the third year of Eisenhower's administration, net sales were $525,679,000. At the end of 1958, Monsanto Chemical Company had a surplus of more than $178.8 million.

    In this context, and with substantial arms reductions potentially harming Monsanto Chemical Company, Eaton's position as the chief representative of the U.S. disarmament delegation is causing concern among diplomats.

    A Canadian said, "I don't know if the United States really wants to negotiate disarmament seriously."

### 水火不相容的身份  美国出席裁军会议首席代表竟是军火商人

    水火不相容的身份
    美国出席裁军会议首席代表竟是军火商人
    编者按：美国“华盛顿邮报”在3月30日所刊载的皮尔逊的一篇文章透露，出席裁军会议的美国代表团的首席代表伊顿原来是一家军火公司的老板。这篇文章承认，美国派伊顿担任这样的职务表明美国并不希望认真谈判裁军问题。现将文章摘译如下：
    艾克所挑选来率领美国在日内瓦的裁军代表团的那个人是完全没有受过外交训练的华尔街的一个律师——佛雷德里克·伊顿。伊顿曾经担任过像战时生产顾问和联合原料局委员这样几个次要的政府职位。此外，在伊顿的背景中还有一章几乎无人知道的一段历史。伊顿是孟山都化学公司的董事的律师。这个公司是原子能委员会下面经营原子能委员会在俄亥俄州姆拉米斯堡的蒙德实验室的承包商。据说，孟山都化学公司还是原子能委员会的防御承包商，虽然这些合同都是保密的。
    孟山都化学公司使伊顿发了很大的财。如果你不怕麻烦看一下孟山都的纪录及其证券和证券交易手续费的情况，你将发现，到1959年12月31日为止，伊顿共拥有一千六百二十一股孟山都的股票，价值约八万美元，全都是赠送的。他在1955年白白得到五百股，在1955年的拆股中又得到了一千股，此后在每年的拆股中都得到数目较少的一些股票。
    你还将发现，在艾森豪威尔政府上台以后，这项股票的价值开始上升。在1952年杜鲁门执政的最后一年的净销售额为七千七百九十万四千七百八十七美元。在1955年艾森豪威尔执政的第三年的净销售额为五亿二千五百六十七万九千美元。在1958年底，孟山都化学公司获得了一亿七千八百多万美元的盈余。
    在这种背景下，而且大大地裁减军备可能使孟山都化学公司受到损失，因此伊顿作为美国裁军代表团的首席代表的地位正在使外交人士感到不安。
    一个加拿大人说，“我不知道美国是否真正希望认真地谈判裁军问题。”
