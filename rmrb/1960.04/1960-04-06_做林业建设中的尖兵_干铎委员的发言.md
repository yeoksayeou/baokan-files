Be a Vanguard in Forestry Construction
Speech by Committee Member Gan Duo

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the work report made by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. When attending the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress as an observer, I was greatly encouraged and inspired by the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian.

I am engaged in forestry science and am also an educator. Before this meeting, I participated in the Ministry of Forestry's National Forest Survey and Design Work Conference and felt extremely excited about the rapid development of forestry construction in our country. At the same time, related to the problems encountered at that meeting, I have a relatively deep understanding of what Vice Chairman Chen Shutong mentioned in his report: "In order to adapt to the development of the situation, we must continue to strengthen political transformation and carry out world view transformation at the same time."

Ten Years of Liberation Witness Forestry Construction Develop by Leaps and Bounds

Our diligent ancestors created a complete set of methods and systems for managing forests more than 3,000 years ago, which no country in the world can match. The book "Qi Min Yao Shu," written more than 1,400 years ago, introduced an ideal method of organizing forestry production, which was much more advanced than German forestry, which was the most advanced in the world 200 years ago. At that time, we were already able to cultivate fast-growing tree species and use mulberry, willow and other trees as rootstocks to graft fruit trees of completely different genera and species, successfully improving varieties. However, long-term feudal oppression and reactionary rule caused continuous damage to forests, and the valuable heritage of forestry production was almost completely buried. Before liberation, American scientists said that China would not even be able to find wood to make coffins. Japanese scientists said that the soil erosion caused by forest devastation in China was beyond repair. We used to be confused by them, but we gradually became more sober and believed that as long as the people held power, even barren land could be turned into green mountains. However, we were not sure how and when this would be achieved.

In the ten years since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, forestry, like all sectors of the national economy, has developed by leaps and bounds at an astonishing pace. The forest area left over from the old society was less than 1.5 billion mu, while the newly planted forests in the past ten years amounted to 750 million mu. This means that our forest area has increased by more than half, not including the large-scale planting of trees around houses and villages. Of these 750 million mu of new forests, 70% were created during the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959. In 1958, Chairman Mao put forward the call to gardenize the land, and the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued instructions for large-scale afforestation, requiring the doubling of China's forest area within ten years, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the people for afforestation. As a result, forests were planted on rocky mountains, orchards were built on beaches, poor mountain valleys became rice and grain producing areas, and the vast Gobi Desert also began to give way to forests. With the realization of the people's communes, a widespread movement to build thousand-mu and ten-thousand-mu forests was launched, and fast-growing and high-yielding forests were vigorously developed, unexpectedly removing the label of slow growth and low yield from forests. Trees that were once thought to take decades or hundreds of years to mature, thanks to the creative activities of the working people, have now been cultivated to mature in eight years for Chinese fir, seven years for eucalyptus, six years for paulownia, five years for poplar, black locust, and so on. Now, on this broad and solid foundation, the Central Committee has put forward the slogan of "three-izations," which is "every forest product has a base, forest farms are set up everywhere, and every forest farm is engaged in high yield," as stated in the People's Daily editorial on March 21. We have estimated that ten years from now, the amount of timber produced in our country each year will be many times greater than the timber production target originally set for 1962. In addition, we will also produce a large amount of bamboo and oil crops every year. By then, the more than 2,000 species of wild plants that have now been identified will also be utilized. How exciting this is!

Realize Forestry Base-ization, Forest Farm-ization, and High-Yield-ization

In order to realize base-ization, forest farm-ization, and high-yield-ization, forest survey and design work, as the vanguard of forestry construction, must be especially strengthened. This was the central content of that conference. They exchanged thousands of achievements in technological innovation and technological revolution and systematically summarized the experiences created by thousands of people in the continuous Great Leap Forward on the basis of learning from the Soviet Union, and revised work procedures and methods. I have been teaching this course for a full twenty years, and on the first day of the meeting, I felt overwhelmed with joy, as if one day was more than equal to twenty years. In the discussion, the following debate once occurred. When conducting a management plan for a forest farm, as a rule, the forests belonging to the same tree species, such as pine trees, regardless of how many patches there are, regardless of how much difference there is between the ages and other conditions of each patch, are all summarized together and called a "working unit." After a series of complex calculations, a unified management system is formulated, requiring the people actually managing it to follow it for a long time. The idea is that in the future, whenever you encounter forests belonging to this working unit, you can follow the rules and regulations to ensure that no mistakes are made, so that timber production can remain stable. Currently, only the German Democratic Republic has canceled this "working unit" thing, on the grounds that it is more reasonable to point out the direction of development for each piece of forest separately than to make unified regulations in a summary. The representatives of the survey team, based on their practical experience, believed that the working unit in the old regulations had never played any role, but because of it, much time was wasted on calculation and listing, and they advocated for its immediate cancellation. Based on my book knowledge, I expressed my agreement, but believed that the current level of forestry in our country was not high enough and should be retained for one or two years for the time being. After the closing of the conference, I found that my ideas were inconsistent with the current situation of comprehensive development and overall leap forward in forestry construction. There is a superstitious ideology and the old bourgeois world view associated with it, which may have played a role in promoting retreat.

Forestry Production and Forestry Scientific Research Must Advance by Leaps and Bounds

First of all, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, relying on the leadership of the Party and the mass line, forestry work in our country is now, and will be in the future, done more and more meticulously. The level is not low but very high, and every piece of forest will be managed very rationally, in accordance with both natural laws and economic requirements. There is no need for this kind of general unified management system. Secondly, under the guidance of the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, forestry production is developing very fast, and changes are becoming greater and greater. This kind of long-term regulation made by a few professionals based solely on a temporary judgment is obviously an unnecessary restriction. The third point, and also the most realistic point, is that now state-owned forest farms and commune forest farms are springing up everywhere, and thousands and thousands of new ones are being built. In order to catch up with the development of the situation, forest survey and design work is very tense, and technological innovation and technological revolution are flourishing, constantly improving labor productivity. We must no longer continue to waste time on this dispensable and complicated procedure. In general, the "working unit" thing that I insisted on is not in line with the actual situation in the case of China's high-speed development of forestry. It is no longer a revolutionary thing, but a thing that hinders revolution. Not to mention retaining it for a year or two, even one or two months would be very harmful. Although, after canceling this thing, we must pay attention to many problems and create many conditions, with the correct leadership of the Party, through the practice of hundreds of thousands of people, it will soon be perfected, and like our ancestors, we will stride ahead in the world. Chairman Mao taught us in his article "In Memory of Dr. Sun Yat-sen": "China is a country with 9.6 million square kilometers of land and 600 million people. China should make a greater contribution to mankind." Forestry production and forestry science are no exception. We must have such lofty ambitions. In fact, from the many fresh things mentioned earlier that have shocked the world, we can already see its possibility and inevitability. Only because I have not transformed myself enough, especially because I have not armed my mind with Mao Zedong Thought, I seem to understand but don't understand, and I am half-believing and half-doubting in the face of fresh things, and in the end, I have played a role in promoting retreat. In this way, I can't even talk about taking on the responsibility of creating fresh things. Linking this matter to my own teaching work and scientific research work, there must be many of the same problems, which must be paid attention to.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report focused on: "In order to victoriously realize the 1960 Leap Forward plan, and in order to accelerate the development of socialist construction, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals in our country are launching a magnificent movement of technological innovation and technological revolution with the momentum of a broken bamboo." He also said: "The technological innovation and technological revolution movement should be combined with the movement to study Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong's works, which is currently being widely carried out throughout the country, so that the movement has correct ideological guidance." I deeply realize that my responsibility is very heavy and I must strengthen self-transformation and undertake it well. Moreover, today's excellent situation is also extremely conducive to self-transformation. The path of transformation is also very clear, that is, to devote oneself wholeheartedly to mass movements, combine work and labor practice, and at the same time, purposefully, deeply, and systematically study Chairman Mao's works. The Second Enlarged Session of the Fifth Central Committee of the Jiusan Society has already made demands on its members, and party organizations and CPPCC at all levels have also created many conditions for us. Therefore, although I had many inappropriate things yesterday, I should start from today, with full confidence, gradually transform myself into a docile tool of the Party and the people, and make due contributions in the high tide of the "three-izations" of forestry, and in the cause of socialism and communism.

This is just a preliminary understanding, please criticize and correct me!

### 做林业建设中的尖兵  干铎委员的发言

    做林业建设中的尖兵
    干铎委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意和衷心拥护陈叔通副主席所作的工作报告。在列席第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议时，听到李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告，又得到极大的鼓舞和启发。
    我是搞林业科学的，也是一个教育工作者。这次会议以前，参加了林业部的全国森林调查设计工作会议，对于我国林业建设的飞跃发展感到无比的兴奋。同时，关联到在那个会议上所接触到的问题，使我对于陈叔通副主席报告中所提到的，“为了适应形势的发展，还必须继续加强政治上的改造，同时进行世界观的改造”，有比较深切的体会。
    解放十年来林业建设飞跃发展
    我们勤劳的祖先在三千多年以前就创造了一整套经营森林的方法和制度，世界上任何国家都比不上。一千四百多年以前写成的齐民要术一书就介绍了一种很理想的组织林业生产的方法，比起两百多年以前曾是世界最先进的德国林业来，我们要先进得多。在那时，我们已经能够培育速生树种，还用桑树、柳树等作枮木，嫁接科属完全不同的果树，成功地改良了品种。但是，长期的封建压迫和反动统治，使森林不断遭到破坏，林业生产的宝贵遗产几乎全遭堙没。解放以前，美国的科学家说，中国将要连做棺材的木材也找不着了。日本的科学家说，中国因森林荒废而引起的水土冲刷，已经无可救药。过去我们曾经被他们迷惑过，但也逐渐有些清醒过来，相信只要人民掌握了政权，连赤地都可以变青山。只是如何实现和什么时候实现，就没有把握了。
    解放十年来，在党中央和毛主席英明领导下，林业同国民经济各个部门一样，以惊人的步伐飞跃地发展着。旧社会遗留下来的森林面积还不到十五亿亩，而十年来新造的森林就有七亿五千万亩。这就是说，我们的森林面积已经增加了一半还多，大规模的四旁植树还不计算在内。这七亿五千万亩新林，有70％是在1958年和1959年连续大跃进中造成的。1958年，毛主席提出了大地园林化的号召，中共中央和国务院发布了大规模造林的指示，要求十年内把我国森林面积翻一番，大大激发了人民群众的造林积极性。于是，石山造上了森林，沙滩建成了果园，穷山沟变成了米粮川，大戈壁也开始给森林让路。随着人民公社化的实现，广泛开展了营造千亩林、万亩林的运动，并且大搞速生丰产林，出人意外地给森林摘下了慢生低产的帽子。一向认为要几十年，一百几十年才能成材的林木，由于劳动人民创造性的活动，培育出了八年成材的杉木、七年成材的桉树、六年成材的泡桐、五年成材的白杨、刺槐等等。现在，在这个广阔而又坚实的基础上，中央提出了“三化”的口号，就是3月21日人民日报社论所载的“样样林产有基地、处处基地设林场、个个林场搞丰产”。我们有过这样的估计：十年之后，我国每年所产木材将比原定要求1962年达到的木材生产指标大好多倍。此外，还要年产近大量的竹材和油料。到那时候，现在已经查清的两千多种野生植物，也都要利用起来。这是多么令人兴奋的事！
    实现林业基地化、林场化和丰产化
    为了实现基地化、林场化和丰产化，作为林业建设的尖兵，森林调查设计工作必须特别加强。这就是那个会议的中心内容。他们交流了几千种技术革新和技术革命成就，还系统总结几千人队伍在学习苏联的基础上在连续大跃进中所创造的经验，修订工作规程和办法。我教这门课已经整整二十年，到会的头一天就感到美不胜收，好像一天还不止等于二十年。在讨论中，曾经发生过这样一个争论。进行一个林场的经营规划时，照例要把属于同一个树种例如松树的林子，不管有多少片，不管各片之间年龄大小和其他情况有多大差别，都汇总在一起叫做一个“作业级”，进行一系列的复杂计算之后，订出一套统一的经营制度，要求实际经营的人长期遵照执行。意思是说，以后凡是遇到属于这一作业级的林子，都照章办事，可以保证不出差错，使木材生产能够保持稳定。现在全世界只有德意志民主共和国把
  “作业级”这东西取消了，理由是对每片林子分别指出发展方向，比较汇总起来作出统一规定要合理得多。调查队的代表们根据实践的经验，认为旧规程里的作业级从来没有起什么作用，可是因为有了它，却浪费了许多计算列表的时间，主张立刻取消。我根据书本的知识表示赞成；但是认为目前我国林业水平还不够，应该暂时保留一两年。会议闭幕以后，发现自己的想法同林业建设全面发展、全面跃进的当前形势相对照是不相符合的。这里面存在着迷信思想和与相牵连的旧的资产阶级世界观，可能因而起了一些促退的作用。
    林业生产和林业科学研究要大踏步前进
    首先，我国的林业工作在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，依靠党的领导和群众路线，现在已经是、将来更加是越做越细致，水平不是不够而是很高，每片林子都会经营的非常合理，既合自然规律，又合经济要求，用不着这种笼统的统一经营制度。其次，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的指引下，林业生产发展得非常快，变化越来越大，这种由少数专业人员单凭一时判断而作出的长期规定，显然是一不必要的条条框框。第三点，也是最现实的一点，现在国营林场和公社林场遍地开花，成千成万地新建起来；为了赶上形势的发展，森林调查设计工作非常紧张，技术革新和技术革命正在蓬勃发展，不断地提高劳动生产率，决不能再在这可有可无的繁杂手续上继续浪费时间。总的说来，我所坚持的“作业级”这东西，在我国林业高速度发展的情况下，是不符合实际的。它已经不是革命的东西而是阻碍革命的东西了。不用说保留一年、两年，那怕只一月、两月，也是十分有害的。虽然，在取消了这种东西之后，还要注意许多问题，创造许多条件；但是，有党的正确领导，通过成千上万人的实践，就会很快地完善起来，像我们祖先一样，大踏步地走在世界的前面。毛主席在“纪念孙中山先生”一文中教导我们：“中国是一个具有九百六十万平方公里土地和六万万人口的国家，中国应当对于人类有较大的贡献。”林业生产和林业科学也不例外，我们必须有这样的雄心大志。实际上，从前面说的许多惊动全世界的新鲜事物，已经可以看出它的可能性和必然性。只因自己改造得很不够，特别是没有用毛泽东思想来武装头脑，才在新鲜事物面前似通不通，将信将疑，到头来起了促退的作用，这样，更谈不上担负创造新鲜事物的责任了。从这件事联系到自己的教学工作和科学研究工作，同样的问题一定不少，必须加以注意。
    李富春副总理的报告中着重谈到：“为了胜利地实现1960年的跃进计划，为了加快社会主义建设事业的发展，我国广大的工人、农民和知识分子，正在以破竹之势，开展着波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动。”又说：“技术革新和技术革命运动应当同目前在全国各地广泛开展的学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东著作的运动结合起来，使运动有正确的思想指导。”我深深体会到自己的责任非常重大，必须加强自我改造，把它很好地承担起来。并且，今天的大好形势也极其有利于自我改造。改造的途径也很清楚，就是全心全意地投入群众性的运动中去，结合工作和劳动的实践，同时，有的放矢地、深入系统地学习毛主席著作。九三学社五届二中扩大会议已经对成员提出要求，各级党组织和政协也给我们创造了许多条件。因此，尽管自己昨天有许多不对劲的地方，但是应该从今天起，有着充分的信心，把自己逐步改造成为党和人民的驯服工具，在林业的“三化”高潮中，在社会主义和共产主义事业中，作出应有的贡献。
    这仅仅是初步的体会，请求批评指正！
