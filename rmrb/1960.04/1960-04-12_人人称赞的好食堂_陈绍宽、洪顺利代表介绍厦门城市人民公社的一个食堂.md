A Highly Praised Good Canteen
Representatives Chen Shaokuan and Hong Shunli Introduce a Canteen of the Xiamen City People's Commune

Chairman, fellow representatives:

We fully endorse the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin. The reports mention vigorously developing urban people's communes, vigorously developing public canteens, and various collective welfare undertakings. We believe this is very important, as it will create more favorable conditions for further developing urban production and construction and transforming urban social life. Now, we will report to the conference on the situation of the Xiamen Xiahe People's Commune Central Canteen. Any inaccuracies, please correct us.

The masses' evaluation of the canteen is: "Neat and clean, the aroma of food wafts, everyone is happy."

The Xiahe People's Commune Central Canteen was established to adapt to the situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the urgent demands of urban workers and residents. In over a year, it has withstood various tests and developed into a good canteen with a scale of thousands of people, which cannot be blown down by the wind, cannot be scattered by thunder, and is praised by everyone. The canteen correctly implemented the grain distribution policy and grain management system, vigorously developed non-staple food production, and established its own pig farm and vegetable base, ensuring that everyone eats their fill and eats well. The meals are not only diverse, but also delicious. During festivals, they slaughter pigs and chickens themselves, and adjust the food according to the habits of ordinary residents during traditional festivals. They also try to provide special care for the elderly, pregnant women, children, and patients, so that the lives of the masses are properly arranged. According to the needs of production and life, the canteen provides meals at any time. During busy production periods, they also deliver meals to the factories, which the workers find very convenient. This canteen also achieves "four hots" (hot rice, hot dishes, hot soup, hot water), "five haves" (has dry rice, has porridge, has vegetable soup, has hot water, has boiling water), and "three cleans" (clean food, clean utensils, clean environment). The masses' evaluation of it is: "Neat and clean, the aroma of food wafts, eat your fill and eat well, everyone is happy." In order to adapt to the needs of the increasingly expanding scale, the canteen also vigorously carried out technological innovation, manufacturing 14 kinds of machines such as indigenous steam stoves, automatic vegetable cutting machines, rice washing machines, dishwashing machines, dumpling wrapping machines, fish scaling machines, and fish ball making machines, which greatly reduced physical labor, saved manpower, materials, and financial resources, and improved work efficiency several times. For example, cutting vegetables used to take three people more than half a day, but now using a vegetable cutting machine, one person can cut all the vegetables in more than an hour. In the past, it took four people to cook rice, but now using a steam stove, only one person is needed, and about 2,400 catties of coal are saved every day. After technological innovation, the canteen expanded its service scope without increasing service personnel. The masses love the canteen immensely, and call it "the home of the workers." Therefore, this central canteen has been rated as a "six-good canteen" several times in the past year, and has been rated as an advanced unit of the canteen by the All-China Women's Federation and the Provincial Women's Federation.

	Changing meal times to take care of special needs

According to the personal experience of the masses, running a public canteen does indeed have countless benefits. Since its opening, the Xiahe Central Canteen has always adhered to the policy of serving production and serving the masses, which not only facilitates the lives of the masses, but also benefits production, and plays a great role in promoting the continuous leap forward in 1959. In order to take care of the characteristics of the three-shift production in factories, the canteen changed the original fixed three meals a day to providing meals 24 hours a day. It can also take the initiative to take care of other special circumstances, such as some agencies and factories increasing night shift work production, some teachers and students going to the mountains early in the morning to plant trees, and sometimes the commune's transportation team rushing to transport goods day and night. As long as they notify the meal time by telephone, the canteen will temporarily work overtime to overcome difficulties and ensure timely supply. The canteen also set up a mother and child room and a small shop, which provides more convenience for women and children. On August 23 last year, Xiamen City was hit by an unprecedented typhoon in 43 years. The canteen chimney was destroyed by the strong wind and the flood flooded the kitchen. Under the strong leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, the canteen finally overcame the wind disaster, insisted on normal supply, and undertook the meal supply task for more than 1,000 disaster victims in four nearby safe points. After the canteen was established, many women were liberated from housework and joined the production front and various social service work. The canteen is not only a place for the working people to eat collectively, but also a center for mass political and cultural activities, and an important base for carrying out socialist and communist education to the masses. Many meetings of the commune are held in the canteen, and the Party's various guidelines, policies, and tasks are conveyed and implemented to the masses from here. The canteen has a library reading room, a club, etc. In the evening or on weekends and holidays, laughter and songs can be heard everywhere upstairs and downstairs, and the sound of reading is loud, full of happiness and joy. People receive communist education here, cultivate collectivist spirit, improve their ideological awareness, and also obtain a rich and colorful cultural life. Therefore, the canteen not only effectively organizes people's material life, but also a communist classroom, and it plays an increasingly significant role in promoting further changes in people's social life and mental outlook.
	Treating running the canteen well as an important political task

Adhering to putting politics in command and implementing the class line and the mass line is the primary condition for running a public canteen well. The Party organization constantly strengthens specific leadership over the canteen work, ensuring that the canteen management power is in the hands of reliable people; it earnestly implements the spirit of "grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other," and constantly studies the mass life issues centered on running the public canteen well, treating running the public canteen well as an important political task. At the same time, it transfers capable cadres to the canteen, cultivates and absorbs activists from the masses as backbones, and relies on their selfless and diligent work to run the canteen well. The commune's Party members and cadres insist on eating in the canteen and actively take the lead in participating in canteen labor, which has also played a good role in improving the canteen work. Since the public canteen is related to the vital interests of the broad masses, it is necessary to resolutely rely on the masses and must obtain the masses' participation and support for the canteen management work. The Xiahe Central Canteen relied on the masses to start from scratch. The canteen premises, cooking utensils, etc. were all voluntarily given, borrowed, and donated by the masses, and the workers also used waste materials during their spare time to make more than 30 pairs of tables and chairs and sent them to the canteen. The canteen work must also be supervised by the masses, such as regularly carrying out the "good service month" movement, setting up red flag competition supervision posts, with the masses inserting the red flags, and listening to the opinions of the masses to improve the work. In this way, the canteen work is built on the basis of broad mass supervision, and it will surely be run well and make remarkable achievements. In addition, the Xiahe People's Commune established a canteen network throughout the commune, and concentrated its efforts to run a central canteen well, making it a pacesetter, setting off a climax of learning from the pacesetter, comparing with the pacesetter, and catching up with the pacesetter, thereby promoting the rapid development of public canteens throughout the commune.

The situation of the Xiamen City Xiahe Central Canteen shows how important a socialist position the public canteen is. It plays an extremely important role in promoting production and construction, serving the needs of the people's lives, thoroughly liberating women, thoroughly transforming cities, and thoroughly changing people's spiritual outlook. Now it can be said that the rapid generalization of urban and rural public canteens will form a powerful tool for promoting the great leap forward in China's socialist cause. The experience of the Xiahe Central Canteen also shows that in order to run the public canteen well, we must regard it as an important organizational part of the socialist cause, we must strengthen Party leadership, adhere to the class line and the mass line, and at the same time, we must have the spirit of making every effort and resolutely running it well. Now it is very clear that as long as we can all realize that the canteen is an objective need of people's social life and adopt a correct and positive attitude, then the public canteen will surely blossom rapidly all over the country, and it will surely become a flower in our lives that blooms more and more brightly and never withers.

    人人称赞的好食堂
    陈绍宽、洪顺利代表介绍厦门城市人民公社的一个食堂主席、各位代表：
    我们完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告。报告中提到大办城市人民公社，大办公共食堂和各种集体福利事业，我们认为是非常重要的事情，这将为进一步发展城市生产建设和改造城市社会生活创造更为有利的条件。现在我们把厦门厦禾人民公社中心食堂的情况，向大会作个汇报，不妥之处，请代表们指正。群众对食堂的评价是：整齐清洁，
      饭菜飘香，人人高兴
    厦禾人民公社中心食堂，是为了适应工农业生产大跃进的形势和城市职工、居民的迫切要求下创办起来的。在一年多的时间里，它经受了种种考验，发展成为一个风吹不垮，雷打不散，人人称赞的具有千人规模的好食堂。食堂正确贯彻了粮食分配政策和粮食管理制度，大搞副食品生产，建立了自己的养猪场和蔬菜基地，保证人人吃得饱吃得好。饭菜不仅做到花样多，而且做到味美可口，逢年过节自己杀猪杀鸡，并根据一般居民过传统节日的习惯调剂饭食，对老人，产妇，小孩，病人还尽量加以特殊照顾，这样就使群众生活得到了妥善安排。根据生产和生活的需要，食堂随时供应饭菜产紧张时，生还把饭菜送到工厂，使工人们感到十分方便。这个食堂还做到：“四热”（饭热、菜热、汤热、开水热）、“五有”（有干饭、有稀饭、有菜汤、有开水、有热水）、“三净”（饭菜净、用具净、环境净），群众对它的评价是：“整齐清洁，饭菜飘香，吃饱吃好，人人高兴”。食堂为了适应规模日益发展
  的需要，还大闹技术革新，制成土蒸气炉、自动切菜机、洗米机、洗碗机、包饺机、削鱼鳞机、打鱼丸机等十四种机器，大大减轻了体力劳动，节约了人力、物力、财力，提高了工效好几倍。比如切菜，过去三个人要切半天多，现在使用切菜机一个人切一个多小时就全部切完了，过去要四个人煮饭，现在用蒸气炉只要一个人就行了，而且每天还节约了煤炭二千四百斤左右。技术革新之后，食堂既扩大了服务范围，又不再增加服务人员。群众对食堂无比热爱，把食堂誉为“职工之家”，因此，这个中心食堂一年来先后几度被评为“六好食堂”，被全国妇联和省妇联评为食堂先进单位。
        改变供膳次数，照顾特殊需要
    根据群众的切身体验，办公共食堂确有说不尽的好处。厦禾中心食堂开办以来，一直坚持为生产，为群众服务的方针，既便利群众的生活，又有利于生产，对实现1959年的持续跃进起着很大的促进作用。为了照顾到工厂三班生产的特点，食堂把原来每天三餐固定供膳，改为整天二十四小时都供膳。它还能主动照顾其他各方面的特殊情况，如有的机关、工厂增加夜班工作生产，有的学校师生一清早要上山造林，有时公社运输队日夜抢运货物，只要他们用电话通知一声供膳时间，食堂就临时加班加点，克服困难，保证照时供应。食堂还办了母子室和小卖部，使妇女和小孩得到更多方便。去年8月23日厦门市受到四十三年来未有的特大台风袭击，食堂烟囱被大风刮毁，洪水浸入厨房，在党的坚强领导和群众的支持下，食堂终于战胜风灾，坚持正常供应，并担负了附近四个安全点共一千多个灾民的供膳任务。办了食堂之后，许多妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，纷纷投入生产战线和参加各项社会服务工作。食堂不仅仅是劳动人民集体进膳的场所，而且成为群众政治、文化活动的中心，成为对群众进行社会主义共产主义教育的重要阵地。公社的许多会议都在食堂召开，党的各项方针、政策和任务，都从这里传达贯彻到群众中去。食堂办了图书馆阅览室、俱乐部等，一到晚间或是周末，节日，楼上楼下，到处谈笑风生，歌声嘹亮，书声朗朗，充满幸福和欢乐的气氛。人们在这里受到共产主义教育，培养了集体主义精神，提高了思想觉悟，也得到丰富多采的文化生活。因此，食堂不仅有效地组织了人们的物质生活，而且是一所共产主义的大课堂，它在促进人们的社会生活和精神面貌的进一步变化，是发挥了愈来愈显著的作用。	把办好食堂当做一项重要政治任务
    坚持政治挂帅，贯彻阶级路线和群众路线，是办好公共食堂的首要条件。党组织经常加强对食堂工作的具体领导，保证把食堂管理权掌握在可靠的人手里；认真贯彻了“一手抓生产，一手抓生活”的精神，经常研究以办好公共食堂为中心的群众生活问题，把办好公共食堂当做一项重要的政治任务。同时，为食堂调配得力干部，从群众中培养并吸收积极分子作骨干，依靠他们大公无私、勤勤恳恳的工作办好食堂。公社党员、干部坚持在食堂吃饭，并积极带头参加食堂劳动，对于搞好食堂工作也起了很好的作用。由于公共食堂关系到广大群众的切身利益，因此必须坚决依靠群众，一定要得到群众对食堂管理工作的参与和支持。厦禾中心食堂就是依靠群众白手起家。食堂场所、炊具等，都是群众自愿让出，借用和赠送的，工人还利用工余时间用废料做了三十多副桌椅送给食堂。食堂工作也必须由群众监督，如经常开展“服务良好月”运动，设立红旗竞赛监督岗，由群众来插红旗，听取群众的意见来改进工作。这样，把食堂工作建立在广泛的群众监督的基础上，就一定能够办得好，并做出显著的成绩来。此外，厦禾人民公社在全社建立食堂网，并集中力量办好一个中心食堂，使之成为标兵，掀起学标兵、比标兵、赶标兵的高潮，从而推动了全社公共食堂的迅速发展。
    厦门市厦禾中心食堂的情况表明，公共食堂是多么重要的一个社会主义阵地，它对于促进生产建设、服务人民生活需要，彻底解放妇女，彻底改造城市和彻底改变人们的精神面貌等等，都是起着极为重要的作用。现在可以这样说，城乡公共食堂的迅速普遍化，它将形成为推动我国社会主义事业大跃进的一个强有力的工具。厦禾中心食堂的经验还表明着，要办好公共食堂，我们必须把它看做是社会主义事业的一个重要的组织部分，必须加强党的领导，坚持阶级路线和群众路线，同时，还必须要有千方百计、坚决办好的精神。现在很清楚，只要我们都能意识到食堂是人们社会生活的客观需要，采取正确积极的态度，那末，公共食堂就一定能迅速遍地开花，而且一定会在我们的生活中，成为愈开愈鲜艳、永不雕谢的花朵。
