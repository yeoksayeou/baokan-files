Xinhua News Agency, Anshan: Anshan Iron and Steel (Ansteel) workers have further improved steel production levels in early April. The average daily steel production level increased by 6.04% compared to the same period in March, and the daily production levels of pig iron and steel products also increased compared to the same period in March.

	Entering April, the technical performance competition centered on technical innovation and technical revolution was launched more extensively, deeply, and organizationally in various Ansteel factories and mines. Collaborative competitions and rival competitions were fiercely launched between related factories and mines, between upper and lower processes, and between similar factories and mines with similar equipment. In the short ten days of early April, they put forward more than 13,000 technical innovation proposals, of which more than 8,500 have been implemented, creating new production records more than 3,400 times, becoming a huge driving force for the continuous leap forward in steel production. Focusing on open-hearth furnaces, and cooperating wholeheartedly to create favorable conditions, in early April, they increased the production of high-quality steel for the country by 4,500 tons. The workers of the Second Steelmaking Plant increased the average daily steel output by 272 tons in early April compared to the same period in March. A heated rivalry was also carried out between Ansteel's ten large blast furnaces.

	The rolling system workers showed their skills even more in the competition. From April 1st to 10th, they overfulfilled the plan, cumulatively increasing the production of high-quality steel for the country by more than 2,600 tons, and the daily steel production level increased by 9.8% compared to the last ten days of March.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing: Chongqing Iron and Steel Company workers launched a labor competition to welcome the "May Day" festival. In early April, the company's steel production level increased by 4% compared to the same period last month, and iron increased by 19%.

	The company's various units have successively formulated technical innovation plans for the second quarter and April, preparing to offer a great gift to the "May Day" festival. The open-hearth steelmaking plant workers plan to link all innovation projects closely related to production in April, focusing on key aspects such as rapid steelmaking, rational charging, post-furnace casting, and lime kilns, into four "dragons." In early April, they had already linked nine experiences such as ore and scrap steel preheating, active circulating material racks, and mechanized furnace door sills into a "dragon," greatly shortening the open-hearth smelting time. At the same time, they linked nine furnace protection experiences, double-spout four-ladle tapping, etc., into a "dragon," increasing the open-hearth charging amount by about one-third.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: In the first ten days of April, Daye Steel Plant workers overfulfilled the steel production plan by 1.46%, with steel production increasing by 13.8% compared to the same period in March; pig iron completed the ten-day plan by 128.8%; and steel production also increased by 16% compared to the same period last month. Currently, the workers are advancing victoriously, determined to greet the "May Day" International Labor Day with even more outstanding achievements.

	From April 1st, the plant launched the fifth "attack battle," advancing bravely towards new goals in production and technical innovation. In ten days, the plant's workers put forward a total of 9,164 innovation proposals, of which 3,115 were implemented, powerfully promoting production. The open-hearth steelmaking workers created a new record of five heats per day for large open-hearth furnaces with double-ladle tapping, with furnace output exceeding the design capacity by one time, and also improved operating efficiency and steel quality.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: In early April, Tangshan Steel Plant produced more than 300 tons more steel products and more than 100 tons more steel ingots per day than the same period last month; the pig iron consumption of converter steel was reduced by another 19 kilograms compared to last month, and the qualified rate of steel ingots reached 99.18%.

	At the end of March, the plant's Party committee, focusing on the current key and weak links in production, formulated a plant-wide technical innovation and technical revolution plan, mobilizing all plant workers to vigorously promote gasification and hot blast. In steelmaking, they first focused on the iron melting furnace, centered on desulfurization, vigorously promoted hot blast, and did everything possible to increase the temperature of molten iron, strengthen operations, eliminate iron melting furnace accidents, and greatly improve the melting rate. The converters adopted the hot blast route, using flue hood preheating to preheat the cold blast, shortening the smelting time and improving the single-furnace production level.

    攻四月　迎“五一”誓夺二季满堂红
    鞍钢开展协作赛对手赛　重钢成套推广先进经验  大冶钢厂发动攻关战役　唐钢推行煤气化热风化
    据新华社鞍山电　鞍钢广大职工在4月上旬又把钢铁的生产水平提高了一步。钢的平均日产水平比3月同时期增长6.04％，生铁和钢材的日产水平都比3月同期有所增长。
    一进入4月，以技术革新和技术革命为中心的技术表演赛，就在鞍钢各厂矿更加广泛深入、更加有组织地展开。在有关厂矿、上下道工序间，在同类型厂矿、同类型设备间，热烈展开了协作赛和对手赛。4月上旬短短十天中，他们就提出技术革新建议一万三千多件，已经实现了八千五百多件，创造生产新纪录三千四百多次，成为推动钢铁生产不断跃进的巨大动力。以平炉为中心，同心同德互造有利条件，4月上旬为国家增产四千五百吨优质钢，第二炼钢厂职工在4月上旬，使钢的平均日产量比3月同期增加了二百七十二吨。鞍钢的十座大型高炉之间，也开展了热烈的对手赛。
    轧钢系统职工更在竞赛中大显身手，4月1日到10日超额完成计划，累计为国家增产二千六百多吨优质钢材，钢材的日产水平比3月下旬增长9.8％。
    据新华社重庆电　重庆钢铁公司职工开展了迎接“五一”节的劳动竞赛。4月上旬，全公司钢的生产水平比上月同期增长了4％，铁增长19％。
    公司各单位纷纷订出了第二季度和4月份的技术革新规划，准备给“五一”节献大礼。平炉炼钢厂职工计划在4月份把所有同生产密切有关的革新项目，围绕快速炼钢、合理多装、炉后浇注、石灰窑等关键，配成四条龙。上旬，他们已将矿石、废钢等预热、活动循环料架、机械化扎炉门坎等九条经验配成一条龙，大大缩短了平炉冶炼时间；同时又将九项护炉经验、双槽四包出钢等配成一条龙，使平炉装入量扩大了三分之一左右。
    据新华社武汉电　大冶钢厂职工在4月份的头一旬中，超额1.46％完成了钢产计划，钢产量比3月份同期增长13.8％；生铁完成旬计划128.8％；钢材产量也较上月同期增长16％。目前，职工们正乘胜前进，决心以更出色的成绩迎接“五一”国际劳动节。
    从4月1日起，全厂开展了第五次“攻关战役”，向生产和技术革新的新目标奋勇前进。在十天中，全厂职工共提出革新建议九千一百六十四项，实现了三千一百一十五项，有力地促进了生产。平炉炼钢职工创造了大平炉双包出钢日产五炉、炉产量超过设计能力一倍的新纪录，还提高了作业效率和钢的质量。
    据新华社天津电　唐山钢厂4月上旬，他们每天比上月同期多产了三百多吨钢材，多产了一百多吨钢锭；转炉钢的生铁消耗比上月又降低了十九公斤，钢锭合格率达到99.18％。
    厂党委在3月底围绕当前生产关键和薄弱环节，制订了全厂技术革新和技术革命的规划，发动全厂职工大搞煤气化、热风化。在炼钢方面，首先抓住化铁炉关，以脱硫为中心，大搞热风，千方百计提高铁水温度，加强操作，消灭了化铁炉事故，大大提高了熔化率。转炉采取走热风路线，利用烟罩预热冷风吹炼，缩短了冶炼时间，提高了单炉生产水平。
