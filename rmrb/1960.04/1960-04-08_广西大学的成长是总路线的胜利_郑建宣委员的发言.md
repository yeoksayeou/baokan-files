Comrade Chairman, Fellow Committee Members:

    I wholeheartedly endorse Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget draft. I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report on the Standing Committee of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC.

    I am an educator from the remote Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Taking advantage of this meeting, I will report on the Great Leap Forward situation of Guangxi University as follows. Guangxi University was re-established in October 1958. It is a product of the Great Leap Forward. This school has adopted the practice of building and teaching simultaneously since its establishment, so the speed of the leap forward is very fast. Although it has only been eighteen months since its establishment, it has established nine departments and fourteen majors, with more than 1,800 students. In order to meet the growing needs of students' productive labor, the school has built a mechanical and electrical plant and laboratory, has more than 130,000 books and more than 50,000 instruments. At the same time, the school also runs a small farm of seventy acres, so that the policy of combining education with productive labor can be specifically implemented. Although there are only first and second year students now, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, under the guidance of the Party's education policy, and under the correct leadership of the Ministry of Education and the Autonomous Region Party Committee, through the efforts of all teachers, students, and staff, not only has the teaching task been successfully completed, but also excellent results have been achieved in productive labor and scientific research. The main points are:

    1. The political consciousness of teachers, students, and staff has been unprecedentedly improved. Guangxi University is a newly established school, and the teachers are supported by colleges and universities across the country. Under the leadership of the school party committee, these teachers, through studying the Party's education policy, participating in the Great Steel Smelting Movement, going to the countryside and factories to support agricultural and industrial construction, and participating in social welfare labor, not only have a further understanding of the education policy, but also strengthened the labor viewpoint and mass viewpoint, and established preliminary feelings with the workers and peasants. The viewpoint of serving the people wholeheartedly has been established. Students have also clarified their learning goals. "Being both red and expert working-class intellectuals" has become the common goal of the majority of teachers and students. And "Listening to the Party and being a docile tool of the Party" has also become a common action program for the majority of teachers and students. This cannot be said to be a great leap forward in ideological consciousness.

    2. The quality of education has improved. Due to the vigorous implementation of the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, our school has basically eliminated the bourgeois educational viewpoints of neglecting politics, despising production, and being divorced from reality, and has established the idea of combining education with productive labor and integrating theory with practice. Students can not only use their brains but also use their hands through productive labor. For example, under very difficult production conditions, the Department of Electrical Engineering relied on the wisdom and labor of the majority of teachers and students to produce 30 kinds of products such as electric motors and transformers of various specifications. Under the guidance of teachers, second-year students made six sets of instruments required for basic electrical engineering experiments and completed the experimental preparation work; teachers and students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering manufactured an eight-foot all-gear lathe; and first-year mechanical students compiled more than 100,000 words of descriptive geometry lecture notes in a short period of time, with high quality. Other departments also have similar achievements. Through productive labor, students can better understand the theories they have learned, so the theories they have learned are more solid. As reflected in the students' exam results, the number of excellent students in the 1959 winter vacation exam increased by more than 30% compared with the summer vacation exam of the same year. Secondly, it is reflected in the content of the courses learned by students, and the requirements are higher. For example, after learning how to install a circuit diagram of seven vacuum tubes, students in the Department of Electrical Engineering felt that the circuit diagram of three vacuum tubes in the lecture notes was too simple. Other departments have the same situation. This is an example of the improvement of the quality of education.

    3. Scientific research results. Guangxi University is a newly established school, and the research equipment is not very abundant. However, due to the daring and hard work of all teachers and students to overcome difficulties, excellent results have finally been achieved. Four hundred and fifty-one scientific research projects have been completed, such as the manufacture of analog electronic computers and the preparation of cystine. These projects were completed by the joint collaboration of teachers and students in the school and the joint collaboration of various factories and mines outside the school. In the past, some people thought that first and second year students could not participate in scientific research work, but the facts tell us that first and second year students can not only participate in scientific research work, but also should participate in scientific research work.

    The above-mentioned achievements are very great. However, our work is not done well enough, the Great Leap Forward is endless, and we cannot be complacent about this. In the future, we should follow Vice Premier Li Fuchun's instructions: "To further closely combine scientific research, education, and production." Continue to work hard and make more and better achievements.

    The rapid growth and great achievements of Guangxi University are the victory of the Party's general line, the victory of the Party's education policy, and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. In participating in this work for more than a year, I have the following three experiences:

    1. "Of all the thousands of things, the Party's leadership is the first." This is a famous saying. The Party leads all undertakings, and schools are no exception. Our school implements the system of the school affairs committee responsible under the leadership of the party committee, and ensures the implementation of the Party's general line and policies in teaching, scientific research, and productive labor. This is the main guarantee for the rapid development of our school. Secondly, it is to put politics in command. Educational work, like other work, must be subordinate to politics, and put political and ideological work in the first place. Teachers must have the idea of serving students and being fully responsible for students. Establishing a new teacher-student relationship and giving play to the mutual assistance and cooperation of new and old teachers are important guarantees for improving the quality of education.

    2. Running a school, like other work, must implement the mass line and carry out mass movements in a big way. This is the fundamental way and fundamental method to complete teaching, scientific research, productive labor and other work with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and it is the guarantee for realizing a comprehensive leap forward in school work. Guangxi University has few old teachers and many new teachers. Therefore, from the first day of school, we encountered the major problem of how to teach basic courses well. On this issue, the school adopted the practice of combining new and old teachers, vigorously cultivating new forces, and letting young teachers teach, and the results were very good. Doing so has solved the current shortage of teachers in our school; it will also have a far-reaching impact on accelerating the growth of the teaching staff and further improving the quality of education and scientific and technological level. This is just one example. In our school, running factories and farms in a big way, carrying out scientific research in a big way, and carrying out cultural and sports activities are all carried out by carrying out mass movements in a big way. Practice has proved that in the work of colleges and universities, whether it is teaching, productive labor, or scientific research, we should adhere to the mass line and let all staff and students carry out mass movements in a big way. This is our inexhaustible source of strength.

    3. We must do a good job in the "three combinations of education, labor, and scientific research." In order to do a good job in the three combinations, in terms of time, these three must be arranged in a planned and reasonable way, otherwise it is easy to squeeze out one of them. In terms of content, these three must be closely combined. At the same time, we must never be satisfied with the achievements we have made, and we should constantly strive and constantly improve the quality of education with the spirit of continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary stages that Chairman Mao often teaches us.

    Currently, teachers, students, and staff of our school are carrying out a vigorous movement of four-good schools, five-good teachers and staff, and six-good students; a high tide of enthusiastically studying Mao Zedong Thought has been set off. And it is organizing all teachers and students to go to the countryside and factories to participate in technological innovation and technological revolution movements, assist factories in carrying out mechanization and automation in a big way, and assist people's communes in carrying out water conservancy and electrification in a big way; combine teaching, productive labor, and carry out scientific research work in a big way. Through the rectification and study of anti-rightist enthusiasm and the socialist education movement, the political consciousness of teachers, students, and staff has been further improved, and everyone's enthusiasm for building socialism has been improved. Now, in the school, there is a situation of full of energy and high morale. We are determined and confident to achieve a greater leap forward in 1960 and create more outstanding achievements. We strive to catch up with the advanced level of national colleges and universities in all aspects within three to five years.

    Finally, I congratulate the conference on its successful completion! I wish Chairman Mao good health! I wish all members good health.

### 广西大学的成长是总路线的胜利  郑建宣委员的发言

    广西大学的成长是总路线的胜利
    郑建宣委员的发言主席、诸位委员：
    我衷心拥护李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告。我完全同意陈叔通副主席关于政协第三届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。
    我是教育工作者，来自祖国边远的广西僮族自治区，趁此次会议机会，把广西大学大跃进的情况作如下发言。广西大学是在1958年10月重新建立的。它是大跃进的产物。这个学校，由于从成立的一天起就采取边建设边开课的做法，所以跃进的速度很快。从开办到现在，虽然才有十八个月，但是已经建立了九个系十四个专业，在校学生已有一千八百余人。为了满足学生生产劳动日益发展的需要，学校已建了机电厂及试验室，已有十三万多册的图书和五万多件仪器，同时学校还办有七十亩地的小型农场，使教育与劳动生产相结合的方针，得到具体的贯彻。现在虽然仅有一二年级学生，但是，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在党的教育方针指导下，在教育部和自治区党委的正确领导下，经过全体师生职工的努力，不但圆满完成了教学任务，而且在生产劳动和科学研究方面，也创造了优越的成绩。主要是：
    一、师生员工政治觉悟空前提高了。广西大学是新办的学校，教师是由全国各院校支援的。这些教师，在校党委的领导下，通过进行党的教育方针的学习，通过参加大炼钢铁运动，下乡下厂支援农业建设和工业建设，参加社会公益劳动等，不仅对教育方针有了进一步的认识，同时，也加强了劳动观点和群众观点，与工农群众建立了初步的感情。树立了全心全意为人民服务的观点。学生也明确了学习的目标。“做又红又专的工人阶级知识分子”已成为广大师生共同努力的方向。而“听党的话，做党的驯服工具”也成为广大师生共同的行动纲领了。这不能说不是思想觉悟的大跃进。
    二、教育质量提高了。由于大力贯彻党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，我校基本清除了忽视政治，轻视生产，脱离实际的资产阶级教育观点，树立了教育与生产劳动相结合，理论联系实际的思想。学生通过生产劳动不仅能动脑而且能动手了。例如电力系在生产条件很困难的情况下，依靠广大师生的智慧和劳动，生产了各种规格的电动机和变压器等三十种产品。在教师指导下，二年级学生制成了电工基础实验所需的仪器各六套，完成实验准备工作；机械系师生制造了八尺全齿轮车床；机械一年级生在短期内编写了十几万字的画法几何讲义，质量颇高。其他各系也有相似的成绩。学生通过生产劳动，对所学的理论更容易体会，因而所学的理论更加巩固。表现在学生期考的成绩上，1959年寒假考试，优良学生人数较同年暑假考试增加30％以上。其次表现在学生所学的课程内容上，要求更高了。例如电力系学生学会安装七个真空管的电路图后，对讲义上所讲的三个真空管的电路图就觉得浅了。其他系也有相同的情况。这就是教育质量提高的例证。
    三、科学研究成果。广西大学是新办的学校，关于研究的设备还不很充裕。但由于全校师生的敢想敢干，克服困难，终于做出了优异的成绩。完成了模拟电子计算机的制造和胱氨酸的制备等四百五十一项科学研究项目。这些项目都是在校内师生共同协作和校外各厂矿共同协作完成的。过去有人认为一二年级学生不能参加科学研究工作，但事实告诉我们，一二年级学生不独可以参加科研工作，而且应该参加科研工作的。
    以上所述的成绩是很大的。但是，我们的工作还做得不够，大跃进是无止境的，我们更不能以此自满。今后我们应遵循李富春副总理的指示：“要进一步密切科学研究、教育、生产三者之间的结合。”继续努力，做出更多更好的成绩来。
    广西大学的迅速壮大和巨大成就，是党的总路线的胜利，是党的教育方针的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。在参加这一年多的工作中，我有下列三点体会：
    一、“千条万条党的领导是第一条”这是一句至理名言。党领导一切事业，学校当然不能例外。我校实行了党委领导下的校务委员会负责制，不论在教学、科研、生产劳动等方面，都保证党的总路线和方针政策的贯彻执行。这是使我校能够得以迅速发展的主要保证。其次是政治挂帅，教育工作，也像其他的工作一样，必须服从政治，并把政治思想工作放在第一位。教师要有为学生服务对学生全面负责的思想。建立新的师生关系，发挥新老教师的互助协作，这是提高教育质量的重要保证。
    二、办学校也像其他工作一样，必须贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动。这是多快好省地完成教学、科研、生产劳动等工作的根本道路和根本方法，是实现学校工作全面跃进的保证。广西大学老教师少新教师多。因此从开学的第一天起，就遇到了如何开好基础课这一大关。在这个问题上，学校采取了新老教师相结合，大力培养新生力量，放手发动青年教师开课的做法，结果很好。这样做既然解决我校当前师资不足的困难；对于加速教师队伍的成长，进一步提高教育质量与科学技术水平也都会发生深远的影响。这不过仅仅一个例子。在我们学校内，大办工厂、农场，大搞科学研究，开展文体活动，都采取大搞群众运动方式进行的。实践证明，在高等学校工作中，不论教学、生产劳动、科研都应该坚持群众路线，都可以放手发动全体员生大搞群众运动，这是我们取之不尽用之不竭的力量。
    三、必须搞好“教育、劳动、科研三结合”。为了搞好三结合，在时间上，必须把这三者有计划的合理地安排，否则很容易把其中之一挤掉。在内容上必须使这三者密切的结合。同时决不能满足于已得成绩，应以毛主席经常教育我们的不断革命和革命阶段论的精神，不断地努力奋斗，不断地提高教育质量。
    目前我校师生职工正在开展一个轰轰烈烈的四好学校五好教工六好学生运动；已掀起了热烈学习毛泽东思想的高潮。并且正在组织全体师生下乡下厂，参加技术革新和技术革命运动，协助工厂大搞机械化自动化，协助人民公社大搞水利化电气化；结合教学、生产劳动大搞科学研究工作。经过反右倾鼓干劲的整风学习和社会主义教育运动，进一步提高了师生职工的政治觉悟，提高了大家建设社会主义的积极性。现在，在学校内，出现了干劲十足，斗志昂扬的局面。我们有决心也有信心在1960年实现更大的跃进，创造出更为卓越的成绩。力争在三五年内，使我校在各方面都能赶上全国高等院校的先进水平。
    最后祝贺大会胜利完成！祝贺毛主席健康！祝贺全体委员健康。
