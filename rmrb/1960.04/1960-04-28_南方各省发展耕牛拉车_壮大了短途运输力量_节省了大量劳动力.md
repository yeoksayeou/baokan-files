Southern Provinces Develop Ox-Cart Transport
Strengthening Short-Distance Transportation and Saving Significant Labor

    (Our Dispatch) The broad rural areas of the southern provinces are changing the habit of "oxen not pulling carts" and launching a mass movement for ox-cart transportation. Allowing oxen to participate in transportation during the agricultural off-season strengthens short-distance transportation capacity and saves a significant amount of labor used for transportation.

    Sichuan Province has more than 50,000 oxen participating in transportation, with each ox completing an average of 240 ton-kilometers of transportation tasks per month. Nanchong Prefecture in this province organized more than 11,000 oxen to pull carts, replacing manual transportation, saving 280,000 workdays in one month. Fujian Province has organized more than 12,000 oxen to participate in transportation. Daoxian County in Hunan Province has eliminated the phenomenon of material backlog due to the development of mass movement of ox-cart transportation.

    The development of ox-cart transportation has also driven the mass movement of building rural roads. For example, Guangdong Province built 4,595 kilometers of new highways and more than 20,000 kilometers of village roads from January to March this year.

    Some areas have also promoted the "train-like" ox-cart system. In Baoan County, Guangdong Province, one ox pulls one cart with seven trailers, carrying 2.5 tons, with an average daily transportation volume of 50 ton-kilometers, equivalent to the carrying capacity of 40 to 50 people.

    Relevant departments believe that there are many oxen in the southern provinces of China, and only a few are currently used for transportation. If ox-cart transport can be fully utilized and train-like systems promoted, it will play a significant role in completing short-distance transportation tasks and supporting agricultural production.

### 南方各省发展耕牛拉车  壮大了短途运输力量　节省了大量劳动力

    南方各省发展耕牛拉车
    壮大了短途运输力量　节省了大量劳动力
    本报讯　南方各省广大农村正在改变“耕牛不拉车”的习惯，开展牛车运输的群众运动。让耕牛在农闲时参加运输，壮大了短途运输力量，节省了大量用于运输的劳动力。
    四川省参加运输的耕牛已有五万多头，每牛每月平均能完成二百四十吨公里的运输任务。这个省的南充专区组织了一万一千多头耕牛拉车，代替人力运输，一个月节省二十八万个劳动日。福建省已组织了一万二千多头耕牛参加运输。湖南省道县由于开展了牛车运输的群众运动，消除了物资积压的现象。
    牛车运输的发展，还带动了兴修农村道路的群众运动。例如，广东省今年1至3月，就新建了四千五百九十五公里公路和二万多公里乡村大道。
    有的地区还推行了牛车列车化。广东省宝安县一牛一车拖七个拖斗，载重二点五吨，平均日运量达五十吨公里，相当于四十到五十人的挑运量。
    有关部门认为，我国南方各省耕牛很多，目前用来参加运输的还是少数，如能充分利用耕牛拉车，并推行列车化，将对完成短途运输任务，支援农业生产起重大作用。
