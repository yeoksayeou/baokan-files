The recent mass movement in Hebei, Henan and other regions to have low-yielding fields catch up with high-yielding fields, and third-class seedlings catch up with first-class seedlings, is of great significance for achieving a bumper summer harvest this year.

The growth of summer crops this year is very good. The five words early, plentiful, high, meticulous, and good can be used to summarize the growth of summer crops. Early, meaning early sowing and early management. Not only did various regions advance the sowing season by half a month to a month, but they also started field management much earlier than in previous years, managing as soon as sowing was done. As a result, summer crops grew very well in winter. As someone in Zhejiang Province described it, "Spring flowers come out early, green in December." Plentiful, referring to the greatly expanded planting area. According to surveys by agricultural departments, the general expansion area is 30% to 40%, and some areas have expanded by more than double. High, the quality of sowing is high. Various regions have generally met high standards for all aspects of sowing, such as deep plowing, fertilization, seeds, ridge preparation, dense planting, pest control, etc., that is, deep plowing, sufficient base fertilizer, good seeds, timely sowing, and rational dense planting. Meticulous, meticulous field management. Generally, specialized teams have been established to be responsible for field management, achieving five "no's" in field management (no yellow seedlings, no missing seedlings, no pests and diseases, no waterlogging, no weeds). Good, summer crops are growing well everywhere, a sea of green. These situations indicate that the foundation for a bumper summer harvest this year is very good. However, it should also be pointed out that there are still some low-yielding fields and third-class seedlings in various regions. According to agricultural department surveys, third-class seedlings account for about 10% of the total nationwide. Therefore, only by universally strengthening field management, so that low yields catch up with high yields, and third-class seedlings catch up with first-class seedlings, can a comprehensive bumper harvest be achieved this summer.

At present, all regions are paying close attention to the management of high-yield plots and high-yield areas. The characteristics of field management in these high-yield plots and areas are: concentrated strength, unified action, meticulous work, and sufficient water and fertilizer, so the crops grow exceptionally strong and vigorous. This is absolutely necessary. These high-yield plots and areas are the primary guarantee for achieving a bumper summer harvest. However, we must never neglect third-class seedlings because we are focusing on high-yield plots. We must strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest. We must seize the opportunity, and while continuing to strengthen the management of high-yield plots and areas, use more effort to turn third-class seedlings into first-class seedlings. All areas with low-yielding fields and third-class seedlings should make changing the face of low-yielding fields and third-class seedlings one of the key tasks of this period. The harvest of low-yielding fields and third-class seedlings has a decisive impact on the overall bumper summer harvest. If the average yield per mu of all low-yielding fields in the country is increased to 200 jin, the country can increase production by 10 billion jin of grain; if the average yield per mu is increased to 250 jin, the country can increase production by more than 15 billion jin of grain. Conversely, if the yield of low-yielding fields remains at the original very low level, the country will harvest 10 billion to 15 billion jin less.

Is it possible to change the situation of low-yielding fields and third-class seedlings? It is entirely possible. The key lies in whether we have the Marxist ambition and great revolutionary drive. At present, most regions are very determined and high-spirited to change low-yielding fields and third-class seedlings, but some individuals do not have enough confidence in changing low-yielding fields and third-class seedlings. For example, some people think that third-class seedlings have a "congenital disease" and there is no way to change them. It cannot be denied that sowing quality has a great impact on crop growth; therefore, many places have put forward the slogan of trying their best to prevent the occurrence of third-class seedlings during the sowing period; however, strengthening field management can also prevent the emergence of third-class seedlings or change the situation of third-class seedlings. Last year, in Bailaitun Production Team of Tianmu Commune in Cang County, Hebei, half of the more than 1,000 mu of wheat were third-class seedlings due to saline-alkali inundation. Later, by adopting methods such as pressing alkali and sweeping alkali, the third-class seedlings were eliminated, so that more than 1,000 mu of wheat reached an average yield of 305 jin per mu. In Xiaguda Brigade of Hancun People's Commune in Qingfeng County, Henan, the average yield of wheat per mu in the area where this brigade was located was only 50 or 60 jin before liberation. Although the yield continued to increase after liberation, it still did not get rid of the "low yield" label. After the Great Leap Forward, this brigade established lofty ambitions, determined to strive for high yields, and diverted Yellow River water from 300 li away to irrigate wheat fields, while continuously increasing fertilizer application. In 1959, the average yield of wheat per mu in this brigade reached 505 jin, greatly exceeding the national average yield. This shows that as long as we exert our full efforts and strive for the upstream, and give full play to people's subjective initiative, we can change low-yielding fields into high-yielding fields. Some people also say that third-class seedlings only account for about 10%, and it doesn't matter whether they are changed or not. This statement is incorrect. Just one example can illustrate the problem. Last year, the average yield per mu of high-yield plots in Dongting Production Team of Shangfang Commune in Xinle County, Hebei Province, was more than 1,000 jin, but because there were still some low-yielding fields with very low yields, the average yield of wheat per mu for the whole team was only 200 jin. High-yield fields are burdened by low-yield fields, and the yield per mu can only be leveled downward, instead of averaging the advanced yield per mu.

To vigorously grasp low-yielding fields, it is necessary to mobilize considerable manpower and material resources and take a series of effective measures in order to completely change the face of low-yielding fields. Where conditions permit, we can also adopt the method of concentrating superior forces to launch concentrated attacks in batches. This method of short-term concentrated attacks with superior forces may cost more manpower and material resources, but it is worthwhile. Because if low-yielding fields are well managed, we will gain the initiative and lay the foundation for a substantial increase in production.

To change the low-yield situation of low-yielding fields, we must first conduct a specific analysis of the low-yield causes of all low-yielding fields, and take different effective measures according to different situations. Some fields have low yields because of poor soil quality. After sowing, it is no longer possible to fundamentally improve the soil, but now, if we put more effort into field management, we can still improve the growth of crops. The poor growth of crops in some fields is due to the threat of drought. If we try to make full use of surface water and groundwater and irrigate diligently, the crops will change from weak to strong. There are also soils that are good and water sources that are sufficient, but the crops do not grow well because of poor sowing and management. This requires strengthening field management and taking various effective measures. All types of low-yielding fields contain great potential for increased production. The key lies in whether people have the ambition to turn low yields into high yields and whether they are willing to make arduous efforts to tap these potentials for increased production.

Changing the face of low-yielding fields mainly relies on the self-reliance of the people's communes in various regions, but it is also necessary for other regions, especially high-yield regions, to provide certain support to low-yield regions. Each county and each people's commune should also organize cooperation and mutual support between local high-yield areas and low-yield areas. In addition, agricultural departments and financial and trade departments in various regions should also provide support to low-yield areas in terms of materials, financial resources and technology. We believe that with the strong leadership of the Party, with the people's communes, with the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members in low-yield areas, with the support of the state and the cooperation between various people's communes and production teams, the face of low-yielding fields of summer crops will definitely be changed, and this year's summer crops will be able to achieve greater and better harvests.

### 争取夏季全面大丰收

    争取夏季全面大丰收
    河北和河南等地，最近开展了一个轰轰烈烈的低产田赶高产田、三类苗赶一类苗的群众运动。这件事情对于实现今年夏季大丰收有着重要的意义。
    今年夏收作物的生长情况十分良好。早、多、高、细、好这五个字可以用来概括夏收作物的生长情况。早，即播种早，管得早。各地不仅把播种季节提早半个月到一个月的时间，而且在田间管理上，也比往年大大提前，做到了一种就管，这样，夏收作物在冬季就长得很好，浙江省有人这样形容，“春花出了头，腊月绿油油”。多，指播种面积大大扩大。根据农业部门的调查，一般的扩大面积30％到40％，个别地区扩大到一倍以上。高，播种的质量高。各地对播种的各个环节，如深耕、施肥、种子、整畦、密植、除虫等等，一般都达到了高标准的要求，即做到了耕得深、基肥足、种子好、播种适时，密植合理。细，田间管理工作细致。一般的都建立了专业队，负责田间管理工作，在田间管理上实现了五无（无黄苗、无缺苗、无病虫、无积水、无杂草）。好，今年夏收作物生长普遍良好，一片葱绿。这些情况说明，今年夏季丰收的基础是很好的。但是也应当指出，各个地区都还存在一部分低产田、三类苗。据农业部门调查，全国三类苗约占10％左右。因此，只有普遍加强田间管理，使低产赶高产，三类苗赶一类苗，今年夏季才可以取得全面大丰收。
    目前，各地对丰产方、丰产片的管理是十分注意的。这些丰产方、丰产片的田间管理工作的特点是：力量集中、行动统一、工夫精细、水足肥饱，因此作物长得异常茁壮旺盛。这是完全必要的。这些丰产方、丰产片是实现夏季大丰收的首要保证。但是绝不能因为抓了丰产方而忽视了三类苗。必须争取全面大丰收。必须抓紧时机，在继续加强管理丰产方、丰产片的同时，用更多的力量来变三类苗为一类苗。一切有低产田、三类苗的地区都应把改变低产田、三类苗面貌作为这一个时期的工作重点之一。低产田、三类苗的收获好坏，对夏季全面大丰收同样有着决定性的影响。如果把全国所有低产田平均亩产量提高到二百斤，全国就可以增产一百亿斤粮食；平均亩产量提高到二百五十斤，全国就可以增产一百五十多亿斤粮食。反之，低产田的产量还停留在原有的很低的水平上，全国就要少收一百亿斤到一百五十亿斤。
    能不能改变低产田、三类苗的状况呢？完全可能。关键在于我们有没有马克思主义的雄心壮志，有没有很大的革命干劲，现在大多数地区对于改变低产田、三类苗决心很大，斗志昂扬，但也有个别的人对改变低产田、三类苗的信心不是很足的。例如有人认为三类苗是“胎里症”，已经没有办法改变。不能否认，播种质量对作物生长有着很大的影响；所以许多地方都提出了在播种时期就竭力防止三类苗发生的口号；但是，加强田间管理，同样可以防止三类苗的出现或改变三类苗的状况。去年河北沧县天木公社白来屯生产队，由于盐碱浸渍，一千多亩小麦中就有一半是三类苗。后来采用压碱扫碱等办法，消灭了三类苗，使一千多亩小麦达到了平均亩产三百零五斤。河南清丰县韩村人民公社夏固大队，解放以前这个大队所在的地方小麦平均亩产量只有五、六十斤，解放以后产量虽然不断提高，但仍没有摘掉低产“帽子”。大跃进以后，这个大队树立了雄心大志，立志争取高产，从三百里外引来黄河水灌溉麦田，同时又不断增施肥料，1959年，这个大队的小麦平均亩产达到五百零五斤，大大超过了全国平均亩产量。这说明只要鼓足干劲、力争上游，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，就可以把低产田改变为高产田。又有人说，三类苗只占10％左右，改变不改变不要紧。这种说法是不对的，只要举一个例子，就可以说明问题。去年河北新乐县上方公社东亭生产队丰产方平均亩产千斤以上，但因为还有一部分产量很低的低产田，结果全队小麦平均亩产只有二百斤。高产田背上了低产田的包袱，亩产量只得往低处拉平，而不是平均先进的亩产量。
    大抓低产田，要调动相当强大的人力物力，采取一系列的有效措施，才能彻底改变低产田的面貌。在条件允许的情况下，还可以采取集中优势力量分批突击的办法，采取这种短期集中优势力量突击的办法，可能会花费较多的人力物力，但是这是值得的。因为低产田管理好了，就争取了主动，为大幅度的增产奠定了基础。
    要改变低产田的低产状况，首先要对所有的低产田的低产原因进行具体分析，根据不同的情况，采取不同的有效措施。有的田的产量不高是因为土质不良，播种以后，要从根本上去改良土壤已不可能，但是现在从田间管理上多下工夫，也还是可以改善作物的生长状况的。有的田作物生长不好是由于受到了干旱的威胁，如果设法充分利用地上水和地下水勤加灌溉，作物就会由弱变壮。还有的土壤也良好，水源也充足，但因为播种、管理不好，作物生长不好。这就要加强田间管理，采取各种有效措施。各种类型的低产田，都蕴藏有很大的增产潜力，关键在于人们有没有变低产为高产的雄心大志，肯不肯作艰苦的努力去挖掘这些增产潜力。
    改变低产田的面貌，主要是靠各地人民公社自力更生，但是其他地区特别是高产地区给予低产地区一定的支援也是必要的。各县、各人民公社，也应组织本地高产区与低产区之间进行协作，互相支援。另外，各地农业部门和财贸部门，也应从物力、财力和技术上，给低产区以支援。我们相信，有了党的坚强领导，有了人民公社，有了低产区广大社员群众的冲天干劲，有了国家的支援和各个人民公社、生产队之间的协作，夏收作物低产田的面貌一定能够改变，今年夏收作物就能够获得更大更好的丰收。
