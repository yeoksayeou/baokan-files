In order to build and defend socialism, the National Militia Representatives Conference solemnly opens in the capital today. This is a grand gathering to review the great achievements of militia work and exchange experiences in militia work. It is also a mobilization conference to further mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the national militia, strengthen militia construction, and promote the sustained leap forward in socialist construction. We extend our warm congratulations to all the representatives attending the meeting and all the militia comrades.

Under the brilliant guidance of the general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune – the three magic weapons put forward by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong – our socialist construction undertaking presents an unprecedentedly excellent situation. Six hundred million people are changing the face of our country from "poor and blank" with a high-speed leap forward, and will build our country into modern industrial, modern agricultural, modern scientific, cultural, and modern national defense socialist power in ten years or less. To achieve this grand task is the will of the 600 million people of our country, and also the will of the national militia. However, while we are concentrating our efforts and carrying out this great construction undertaking with soaring revolutionary drive, we must never forget that there is still imperialism in the world; imperialism is the source of war, just as pointed out in the 1957 Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties: "As long as imperialism exists, there is soil for aggressive wars." At present, due to the unprecedented strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the world's peace forces, the war and aggression policies of the US imperialists have suffered serious setbacks. They are not only unpopular politically, but also lag behind in military technology, so they have to be forced to make certain peaceful gestures. But on the one hand, it is playing with words of peace, and on the other hand, it persists in implementing war and aggression policies, arming West German militarism in Europe; concluding a military treaty with Japan in Asia, reviving Japanese militarist forces; at the same time, stepping up the expansion of military bases, desperately developing missiles and nuclear weapons, and actively preparing for new wars of aggression, attempting to suppress the national independence movements of colonial and neutral countries, eliminate socialist countries, and achieve its goal of plundering, enslaving, and dominating the world. US imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan, and constantly infringes on our territorial waters and airspace, frequently conducts military exercises and military provocations in our coastal areas, threatens our security, and insists on being hostile to the Chinese people. Therefore, we must maintain high vigilance against this war conspiracy of US imperialism, continue to strengthen our national defense forces, in order to protect the smooth progress of our peaceful construction.

In order to build and defend the socialist cause, we must take Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, and not only build a modern People's Liberation Army, but also run militia divisions in a big way. On the one hand, we must organize the broad masses to carry out large-scale production and become a labor army for production and construction, changing the face of poverty and backwardness. On the other hand, we must arm the masses so that they have the armed self-defense skills to defend against imperialist aggression and strengthen national defense. Comrade Mao Zedong's "everyone is a soldier" thought did not just arise now. It was put forward as early as the First Domestic Revolutionary War period, in the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." Later, with the development of the revolutionary situation, this military thought continued to develop. Regarding the organization of a labor army, Comrade Mao Zedong proposed in the report "Get Organized!" made in 1943 that we should have two armies, an army for fighting and an army for labor. "We have the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army for fighting; this army should also be used as two armies, fighting on the one hand and producing on the other." Regarding the establishment of a labor army, "it is to organize the masses, mobilize all the strength of all the people, all the forces of all military units, government organs, and schools, all the full and semi-labor power of all men, women, old and young, without exception, as long as it is possible, and organize them into a labor army." He also said: "In terms of the peasant masses, for thousands of years, it has been an individual economy, with each household as a production unit. This kind of scattered individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, which makes the peasants themselves fall into eternal poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize." Regarding arming the people, Comrade Mao Zedong created the idea of combining the main forces, local forces, and militia, and combining armed and unarmed masses in building the people's army, as well as a complete set of military thinking guiding the revolutionary war to defeat the enemy, based on a scientific materialist dialectical viewpoint, as early as the Second Domestic Revolutionary War period, so that we were able to defeat domestic and foreign enemies who were far superior to us in number and equipment, and achieved the great victory of the people's revolutionary war. Historical experience proves that, under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought, the militia made great contributions in the long revolutionary war period, in cooperating with the People's Liberation Army to launch struggles against the enemy, consolidating and defending the production and construction of the revolutionary base areas, and developing and strengthening the People's Liberation Army. It played a great role in the victory of the people's revolutionary war. According to Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought, no enemy can defeat us, but we can smash the attacks of any powerful enemy. In the autumn of 1958, during the Great Leap Forward across the country, because imperialism launched a frenzied military provocation against our country, Comrade Mao Zedong proposed, "Imperialism bullies us so much, this needs to be dealt with seriously. We must not only have a powerful regular army, but also run militia divisions in a big way." He said, "The organization of the militia division is very good and should be promoted. This is a military organization, a labor organization, an educational organization, and a sports organization." This determines the functions of the militia in building socialism and defending socialism, better integrating economic construction and national defense construction, strengthening both economic construction and national defense construction. For the past two years of running militia divisions in a big way, the militia organizations have played the role of main force and shock brigade on all production and construction fronts, creating countless miracles, and emerging with thousands of heroic model figures who enjoy high prestige among the masses. The broad masses of the militia have also exerted powerful power and made immortal contributions in assisting the People's Liberation Army and public security departments to defend land and sea borders, capturing special agents parachuting from the air and infiltrating from the land and sea, suppressing the remnant counter-revolutionaries, and maintaining social security. The militia organization has also improved people's socialist and communist awareness, enhanced national defense concepts and revolutionary vigilance, strengthened organization, discipline, and collectivist concepts, and also enhanced people's health, courage, and resourcefulness, thus making people more energetic, full of energy, and having a far-reaching influence and a great role in changing the mental outlook of the people. All these show that running militia divisions in a big way has already achieved brilliant achievements in our country. This is the victory of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the development of Mao Zedong's military thought in the new period of socialist construction, and an outstanding contribution to the dialectical unity of socialist construction and national defense construction.

In order to build our great socialist country at high speed, and at the same time defend against possible imperialist aggression, what is the central task of the national militia work at present? The first is to concentrate efforts to carry out production and construction, and set off a new high tide of a greater leap forward on all fronts. Because only by developing production at a high speed and doing a good job in economic construction can we fundamentally strengthen national defense forces. Therefore, the national militia must hold high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and give full play to the role of the militia as the main force and shock brigade in production and construction. At the same time, on the principle of doing a good job in production, actively learn the military skills of defending the motherland, exercise the body, and be vigilant against the imperialist aggression conspiracy, and be ready to defend the motherland at any time. The national militia should all be promoters in politics, shock workers in production, pioneers in technological innovation and technological revolution, good soldiers in national defense, and outstanding athletes in sports. Militia work must continue to adhere to putting politics in command and the absolute leadership of the Party, and constantly educate the militia with communist ideas and the spirit of the People's Liberation Army's hard work and simplicity, heroic struggle, obedience to leadership, and observance of discipline. Militia work is a work with extensive social character, therefore, all aspects must cooperate closely, follow the mass line, and promote democratic style. The content of militia activities should be centered on production and construction, diverse, lively, in order to continuously promote the sustained great leap forward of socialist construction, and strive to build our country into a strong socialist country in a short period of time.

National militia comrades, our great motherland needs you to build it, and also needs you to defend it! Everyone should keep in mind the instructions given to you by the Party Central Committee and the State Council. The Party Central Committee and the State Council said in their congratulatory message to this National Militia Representatives Conference: "We are a socialist country, we love peace, and advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Our social system stipulates that we will not occupy an inch of other people's territory. We eagerly hope for a very long-term peaceful environment to build socialism. However, when US imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, when US imperialism is stepping up its arms expansion and war preparation, expanding military bases around us, and vigorously supporting the resurgence of Japanese militarism, we must not lose the slightest vigilance and relax the necessary precautions. We must strengthen the modernization of the People's Liberation Army and strengthen the construction of the militia, and prepare for the war of defense against imperialist aggression. If the imperialists dare to launch a war of aggression against our country, they must be made to drown in the vast ocean of the entire people being soldiers in our country."

    为了建设和保卫社会主义
    全国民兵代表会议今天在首都隆重开幕了。这是一个检阅民兵工作巨大成绩和交流民兵工作经验的群英大会，也是进一步调动全国民兵的革命积极性，加强民兵建设，促进社会主义建设的持续跃进的动员大会。我们谨向出席会议的全体代表和全国民兵同志们致以热烈的祝贺。
    我国的社会主义建设事业，在党和毛泽东同志提出的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社三大法宝的光辉照耀下，呈现出空前未有的大好形势。六亿人民正以高速度的跃进步伐，改变着我国“一穷二白”的面貌，要以十年或者更短一点的时间，把我国建设成为一个现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的社会主义强国。实现这个宏伟的任务，是我国六亿人民的意志，也是全国民兵的意志。但是，我们在集中力量以冲天的革命干劲进行这个伟大的建设事业的同时，绝不能忘记世界上还有帝国主义；帝国主义就是战争的根源，正像1957年共产党和工人党莫斯科会议宣言中所指出的：“只要帝国主义还存在，就有发生侵略战争的土壤。”目前，由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量以及世界和平力量空前强大，使美帝国主义者的战争和侵略政策遭到了严重挫折，不但在政治上不得人心，军事技术上也落在后面，所以不得不被迫作出某些和平表示。但是它一方面玩弄和平词句，一面坚持执行战争和侵略政策，在欧洲武装西德军国主义；在亚洲同日本订立了军事条约，复活日本军国主义势力；同时加紧扩张军事基地，拼命发展导弹和核武器，积极准备新的侵略战争，企图镇压殖民地和中立国家的民族独立运动，消灭社会主义国家，达到它掠夺、奴役和统治世界的目的。美帝国主义现在仍然霸占着我国领土台湾，并且不断的侵犯我国领海领空，经常在我国沿海进行军事演习和军事挑衅，威胁我国安全，坚持与中国人民为敌。因此，我们必须对美帝国主义的这种战争阴谋保持高度警惕，继续增强国防力量，以保卫我们和平建设的顺利进行。
    为了建设和保卫社会主义事业，我们必须以毛泽东同志的思想为指针，不但要建设现代化的人民解放军，同时还要大办民兵师。一方面是把广大群众组织起来，进行大生产，成为生产建设上的劳动大军，改变贫穷落后的面貌。一方面是把群众武装起来，使群众具有防御帝国主义侵略的武装自卫本领，加强国防。毛泽东同志的“全民皆兵”的思想并不是现在才有的。早在第一次国内革命战争时期，在“湖南农民运动考察报告”中就提出来了。以后随着革命形势的发展，这个军事思想继续发展着。关于组织劳动大军方面，毛泽东同志在1943年所作的“组织起来”的报告中就提出了我们要有两支大军，一支打仗的大军，一支劳动的大军。“打仗的军队，我们有八路军、新四军；这支军队也要当两支用，一方面打仗，一方面生产。”关于建立劳动大军，“就是把群众组织起来，把一切老百姓的力量、一切部队机关学校的力量、一切男女老少的全劳动力半劳动力，只要是可能的，就毫无例外地动员起来，组织起来，成为一支劳动大军。”他又说：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦，克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化”。关于武装人民方面，毛泽东同志早在第二次国内革命战争时期，就创立了主力部队、地方部队和民兵相结合，武装群众和非武装群众相结合的人民军队建设和人民战争的思想，以及运用科学的唯物辩证观点指导革命战争克敌致胜的一套完整的军事思想，从而使我们能够战胜在数量上和装备上远较自己强大的国内外敌人，取得了人民革命战争的伟大胜利。历史经验证明：在毛泽东同志军事思想的指导之下，民兵在长期的革命战争时期，在配合人民解放军展开对敌斗争，巩固和保卫革命根据地的生产建设，发展和壮大人民解放军等方面，都作了巨大贡献，对人民革命战争的胜利，起了伟大作用。按照毛泽东同志的这个军事思想，任何敌人都打不败我们，而我们却能够粉碎任何强大的敌人的进攻。1958年秋，全国大跃进时，由于帝国主义对我国发动了疯狂的军事挑衅，毛泽东同志提出“帝国主义如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。我们不但要有强大的正规军，还要大办民兵师。”他说，“民兵师的组织很好，应当推广。这是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织。”这就确定了民兵建设社会主义和保卫社会主义的职能，把经济建设和国防建设更好的密切结合起来，既加强了经济建设，又加强了国防建设。大办民兵师两年以来，民兵组织在各个生产建设战线上，都发挥了主力军和突击队的作用，创造了无数奇迹，涌现了千千万万在群众中享有盛望的英雄模范人物。广大民兵在协助人民解放军和治安部门保卫陆海边防，捕捉空降和陆上海上潜入的特务，镇压残余反革命，维护社会安全等方面，也发挥了强大威力，立下了不朽功迹。民兵组织还使人们提高了社会主义、共产主义觉悟，增强了国防观念和革命警惕性，增强了组织性、纪律性和集体主义观念，还增强了人民的健康、勇敢和机智，因而使人更加意气风发，干劲冲天，对改变人民的精神面貌具有深远的影响和伟大作用。所有这些，说明了大办民兵师在我国已经取得了光辉的成就。这是党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社的胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛泽东军事思想在社会主义建设新时期的发展，是把社会主义建设和国防建设辩证地统一起来的一项杰出贡献。
    为了高速度地建设我们伟大的社会主义国家，同时防御帝国主义可能的侵略，当前全国民兵工作的中心任务是什么呢？首先就是要集中力量，进行生产建设，在各个战线上掀起一个更大跃进的高潮。因为只有高速度地发展生产，把经济建设搞好，才能从根本上加强国防力量。因此，全国民兵要高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗，发扬民兵作为生产建设主力军和突击队的作用。同时要在搞好生产的原则下，积极学习保卫祖国的军事本领，锻炼身体，并且对帝国主义的侵略阴谋提高警惕，随时准备保卫祖国。全国民兵人人都要作政治上的促进派，生产上的突击手，技术革新和技术革命中的急先锋，国防上的好战士，体育上的优秀运动员。民兵工作，要继续坚持政治挂帅和党的绝对领导，并且经常以共产主义思想和人民解放军艰苦朴素、英勇奋斗、服从领导、遵守纪律的精神教育民兵。民兵工作是一个具有广泛社会性的工作，因此，要各方面通力协作，走群众路线，发扬民主作风。民兵活动的内容要以生产建设为中心，多种多样，生动活泼，以便不断促进社会主义建设的持续大跃进，争取在短时间内把我国建设成为强大的社会主义国家。
    全国民兵同志们，我们伟大的祖国需要你们去建设它，也需要你们去保卫它！大家紧紧记着党中央和国务院给你们的指示，党中央和国务院向这次全国民兵代表会议的祝词中说：“我们是社会主义国家，我们热爱和平，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，我们的社会制度规定了我们不会去侵占别人的一寸领土，我们热切地希望有一个很长期的和平环境来建设社会主义。但是，当着美帝国主义还侵占我国领土台湾的时候，当着美帝国主义加紧扩军备战，在我们身边扩大军事基地，并且极力扶持日本军国主义再起的时候，我们绝不能丧失丝毫的警惕和放松应有的戒备。我们必须在加强人民解放军现代化的同时，加强民兵的建设，作好防御帝国主义侵略战争的准备。如果帝国主义胆敢向我国发动侵略战争，就一定要使它们淹没在我国全民皆兵的汪洋大海里。”
