Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I will speak on the issue of Guangdong Province's reception and resettlement of returned overseas Chinese.

Guangdong is the ancestral home of the vast number of overseas Chinese in our country. We have many relatives residing in Indonesia and other overseas locations. Moreover, our geographical position as the southern gateway of the motherland allows direct access to overseas locations. Therefore, the people of Guangdong consciously recognize that receiving and resettling large numbers of returned overseas Chinese is our glorious task.

Since the latter half of last year, after certain powerful groups in Indonesia, incited by U.S. imperialism, stirred up an anti-China and anti-Chinese tide, overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia have been subjected to comprehensive persecution, with tens of thousands of compatriots displaced and deprived of their livelihoods. The people of our entire province are extremely indignant at the actions of these powerful groups in Indonesia and have protested vehemently, actively preparing to welcome and receive the persecuted overseas Chinese returning home. After the State Council issued instructions on receiving and resettling returned overseas Chinese on February 2nd of this year, the people of Guangdong province further launched a fervent campaign to receive and resettle returned overseas Chinese. Under the direct care and guidance of the Party Central Committee, the specific leadership of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, and the close cooperation and support of the people of neighboring provinces and regions, we completed the task of receiving over 12,000 compatriots who have returned to the country since January of this year, and resettling those assigned to Guangdong Province.

Currently, the more than 7,000 compatriots who returned on the first and second batches of ships sent by the motherland, and the more than 4,000 compatriots from Indonesia and other countries who returned at their own expense since January of this year, have all been swiftly and properly resettled. In addition to assisting the Guangzhou office of the Reception and Resettlement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China in distributing returnees to state-owned overseas Chinese farms in Fujian, Yunnan, and Guangxi provinces (autonomous regions) to participate in construction, more than 3,000 people have remained in Guangdong. Based on the needs of the state and individual wishes, they have all been properly resettled. Besides a small number who wish to return to their original homes and reunite with their relatives, and have been properly arranged for production and life by the local people's communes, the majority wish to settle in state-owned overseas Chinese farms. Some returnees with other technical expertise have been assigned to various factories, mines, enterprises, and cultural and educational departments within the province, where they have been warmly welcomed by all departments. Returned overseas Chinese students and socially employed young people with educational qualifications have entered the Guangzhou and Shantou Overseas Chinese Students' Supplementary Schools for secondary education.

The motherland's enthusiastic reception has brought many of the compatriots to tears upon setting foot on the motherland's soil, filled with immense gratitude. They said, "We worked hard overseas our entire lives, only to be driven out in the end. If it weren't for the strength and concern of the motherland, and the ships sent to pick us up, we would never have seen the soil of the motherland again in this lifetime!" After returning to the motherland, the returnees saw the great changes that have taken place in the motherland and Guangdong over the past decade, further inspiring their patriotic enthusiasm. Regardless of gender, age, or youth, they all expressed their willingness to obey the motherland's assignments and contribute to socialist construction. They happily took up their work posts and quickly settled down. They humbly learned advanced techniques from veteran farm members and workers, and also taught their own expertise to others. Many of them have also made achievements in production within a very short period.

In order to accomplish this glorious political task of receiving and resettling returned overseas Chinese, Guangdong, Guangxi (Autonomous Region), Fujian, and Yunnan provinces, as well as various regions and departments within the province, have engaged in extensive cooperation, putting forward the slogan of "Giving convenience to others and keeping difficulties for ourselves," and fully demonstrating the communist spirit. For example, a large number of basic construction materials, means of production, and means of livelihood required for receiving and resettling returned overseas Chinese were not originally planned for, but were handled as special cases and given priority allocation to ensure supply. The transportation departments allocated transportation vehicles at any time according to needs. Currently, various materials are continuing to be transported to various ports and resettlement points in a steady stream. Hainan, Zhanjiang, and ports in various locations, state-owned farms, state-owned overseas Chinese farms, and people's communes in overseas Chinese hometowns are also expanding cultivated land, adding production tools, and building more houses to make thorough preparations for the production and living arrangements of returned overseas Chinese.

The entire population of Guangdong Province, as well as the relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese, are extremely concerned about the safety of compatriots persecuted by certain powerful groups in Indonesia. Like the people of the whole country, the hearts of the 38 million people of Guangdong and the Indonesian overseas Chinese are always connected. They unanimously stated: We will never allow our relatives, our brothers and sisters, to be bullied abroad. In cities and villages, on various fronts of economy, culture, education, and politics and law, many people have written letters to overseas Chinese affairs departments, requesting to participate in the work of receiving returned overseas Chinese and serving them. Employees of the transportation, commercial, and service departments gave up their traditional holiday vacations, and some worked diligently day and night in the rain, proposing guarantees of "Materials arrive before relatives" and "People arrive, luggage arrives." They said: "Our relatives, brothers, and sisters are being bullied overseas, how can we tolerate it! In order for them to return safely and participate in the socialist construction of the motherland as soon as possible, we won't mind being a little more tired and sweating a little more!" Before the arrival of the new returnees, many farm members of overseas Chinese farms and commune members of people's communes vacated their better houses for the new returnees to live in, willingly living in tents or thatched houses themselves. A large number of relatives of overseas Chinese and former returnees in Guangzhou often visited the provincial and municipal reception agencies to request participation in the reception work. Many people forgot to eat and sleep while preparing to welcome their overseas relatives, and they were tireless. Therefore, the new returnees said: "The motherland is home everywhere, and everyone in the hometown is a relative!"

Fellow representatives, we have successfully completed the tasks of the first and second batches of receiving and resettling returned overseas Chinese. In view of the fact that the anti-China tide stirred up by certain powerful groups in Indonesia has not only not subsided, but is continuing to develop, the number of overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia who are eager to return to the country is increasing by tens of thousands every day. In the future, we must prepare more actively and continue to do a good job in receiving and resettling large numbers of returned overseas Chinese. The great leap forward in socialist construction in the motherland, and the people's communes that are being consolidated and developed day by day throughout the country, provide the most favorable conditions for the employment and education of the vast number of returned overseas Chinese. Our Guangdong Province, like all parts of the country, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, has achieved tremendous achievements in all aspects after the continuous great leap forward of 1958 and 1959. In 1960, Guangdong's national economy will continue to leap forward in a comprehensive and better way. This will provide a broader path for the employment and education of the vast number of returned overseas Chinese. For the glorious and long-term task of receiving and resettling a large number of overseas Chinese returning to the country, we in Guangdong must also vigorously expand a number of state-owned overseas Chinese farms. According to current plans, the state-owned Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm alone will reclaim more than 100,000 mu of wasteland. Other related farms have also initially formulated their own development plans. In addition, six new state-owned overseas Chinese farms will be built recently, and overseas Chinese work areas will be established in a number of old state-owned farms to prepare for more overseas Chinese to return to the country to participate in construction in the future. For returned overseas Chinese students and young people, in addition to expanding the existing Guangzhou and Shantou secondary supplementary schools, we also plan to establish agricultural technology schools in Hainan to train agricultural technicians.

These facts once again powerfully prove that the days when overseas Chinese had to leave their homes and wander overseas to make a living are gone forever! The motherland is undergoing great socialist construction, and the overseas Chinese hometowns are undergoing earth-shaking changes. The government has prepared good conditions for overseas Chinese to return to the country to live and work in peace and contentment. The successful completion of the first and second batches of reception and resettlement work has also proved that we are fully capable of doing a good job in the resettlement work of overseas Chinese returning to the country. We warmly welcome all overseas Chinese in Indonesia or other countries, whether displaced, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue to reside in the local area, to return to the country to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland in Guangdong Province for the happiness of future generations! Whether tens of thousands or millions return, we will welcome them all! Facts will prove that we can not only, but will properly arrange their lives and work, so that each of them can happily and carefree join the people of the country in building a great motherland and a beautiful hometown!

    三千八百万颗心飞向海外迎亲人
    林锵云代表谈广东省接待和安置归国华侨的工作主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理和谭震林副总理的报告，及人大常委会的工作报告。现在我就广东省接待和安置归国华侨的问题作发言。
    广东是我国的广大华侨的故乡，我们有许多亲人居留在印度尼西亚及海外其他地方，而且，我们的地理位置又处在祖国南方的大门户，可以直通海外，因此，广东人民自觉地认识到：接待和安置大量归国华侨，是我们光荣的任务。
    自从去年下半年以来，印度尼西亚有势力集团，在美帝国主义策动下掀起了反华排华逆流以后，侨居在印度尼西亚的华侨全面地受到了迫害，成千成万的侨胞，流离失所，丧失生计。我们全省人民对印度尼西亚有势力集团这种行为都异常愤慨，纷纷抗议，并积极准备和欢迎接待受迫害的侨胞回来。今年2月2日，国务院发出关于接待和安置归国华侨的指示以后，广东全省人民进一步掀起了接待和安置归侨的热潮。在党中央的直接关怀指示和广东省委的具体领导与友邻省区人民的密切协作支持下，我们完成了今年一月以来回国的一万二千多名侨胞的接待和分配给广东省的归侨的安置工作任务。
    现在，乘坐第一、二批祖国派去的船回来的七千多侨胞和今年一月以来自费回来的印度尼西亚以及其他国家的四千多侨胞，都已经迅速得到了妥善安置。除协助中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会驻广州办公室分送到福建、云南、广西三省（自治区）各国营华侨农场参加建设以外，留在广东的有三千多人。根据国家的需要和个人志愿，他们都得到妥善的安置。除少数愿意回原籍与亲属团聚的已由当地人民公社妥善安排他们生产、生活以外，大部分都愿意到国营华侨农场去安家落户。归侨中一些有其他技术专长的，已经分别安排在省内各厂矿企业、文教部门，受到各部门的热烈欢迎。归国华侨学生和具有学习条件的社会职业青年，都已进入广州、汕头两所归国华侨学生中等补习学校学习。
    祖国的热情接待，使侨胞们一踏上祖国的土地，许多人都热泪盈眶，感激万分，他们说：“我们在海外做工一辈子，到头来被人赶，要不是祖国强大和关怀、还派船来接我们，今生今世再也难见祖国的土地了！”。归侨们回到祖国以后，看到祖国和广东十年来的伟大变化，更激发了他们的爱国热情，无论男女、老年、青年都表示服从祖国分配，参加社会主义建设尽一分力量。他们愉快地走上工作岗位，并且很快地安心下来。他们虚心地向老场员、老工人学习先进技术，也把自己的专长教给别人。他们中还有不少的人在很短的时间内就在生产上做出了成绩。
    为了做好接待和安置归侨这项光荣的政治任务，广东、广西（自治区）福建、云南各省以及省内各地区各部门都进行了大协作，他们提出“把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己”的口号，充分发扬了共产主义风格。如接待和安置归侨所需的大量基建材料、生产资料、生活资料，原无计划，均作专案处理，并且得到优先调拨，保证供应。交通运输部门根据需要，随时调拨交通工具。目前，各种物资、材料，正源源不断地继续运到各口岸和安置点。海南、湛江和各地的港口、国营农场、国营华侨农场，以及侨乡人民公社为了迎接海外亲人，也正在扩大耕地，增添生产工具，和增建房屋等等，为归侨回国后的生产和生活的安排进行了周密的准备。
    广东省全体人民和侨眷归侨，都异常关心受到印度尼西亚有势力集团迫害的侨胞的安危。像全国人民一样，广东三千八百万人民和印度尼西亚华侨的心是时刻都相连着的。他们一致表示：绝不容许我们的亲人，我们的兄弟姐妹在国外受人欺侮。在城市和农村，在经济、文教、政法各条战线上，许多人都写信给侨务工作部门，要求参加接待归侨的工作，为归侨服务。运输、商业和服务部门职工，放弃我国传统节日假期，有的冒着大雨，日夜苦干巧干地工作着，他们提出保证：“物资先到等亲人”和“人到行李到”的口号。他们说：“我们的亲人、兄弟、姐妹在海外受人欺侮，怎能容忍！为了他们能早日平安地回来参加祖国社会主义建设，我们就是更累点更多出些汗，也算不了什么！”许多华侨农场的场员和人民公社社员，在新归侨到来之前，就腾出自己较好的房屋，留给新归侨居住，自己宁愿住到帐棚或草房里。广州市大批侨眷旧归侨经常上门到省、市接待机构要求参加接待工作。许多人为准备欢迎海外亲人而忘了吃饭，忘了睡觉，他们毫不知疲倦。因此，新归侨们都说：“祖国到处是家乡，家乡个个是亲人！”
    各位代表，我们已经胜利完成了第一、二批接待和安置归侨的任务了。鉴于印度尼西亚有势力集团排华的逆流不但没有收敛，相反地仍在继续发展，居留印度尼西亚而迫切要求回国的侨胞，数以万计地日益增长着。今后我们还要准备更加积极地和继续不断地做好接待和安置大量归国华侨的工作。祖国的社会主义建设大跃进，和全国各地正在日益巩固和发展的人民公社，为广大侨胞的回国就业就学，提供了最有利的条件。我们广东省和全国各地一样，在伟大的中国共产党领导下，经过1958年和1959年的连续大跃进，各方面都取得了巨大的成就。1960年，广东国民经济将继续全面更好地跃进。这就为广大的归侨就业、就学提供更加广阔的途径。为着接待和安置大量华侨回国这一光荣的长远任务，我们广东还要大力扩建一批国营华侨农场。根据现在计划，仅国营兴隆华侨农场一处，就要再开荒十万多亩。其他有关的各个农场也已初步制订了自己的发展计划。此外，最近还要新建六个国营华侨农场，并在一批老的国营农场中建立华侨作业区，为今后更多的侨胞回国参加建设做好准备。对于归国华侨学生、青年，除了扩建现有的广州、汕头两所中等补习学校外，还准备在海南建立农业技术学校，造就农业技术人材。
    这些事实，再一次有力地证明了，华侨为谋求生计，不得不离乡背井、漂泊海外的日子已经一去不复返了！祖国正在进行着伟大的社会主义建设，侨乡正在发生着翻天复地的变化。政府已经为侨胞们回国安居乐业准备了良好的条件。这次第一、二批接待、安置工作的顺利完成，也证明我们完全有条件做好侨胞回国的安置工作。我们热烈地欢迎凡是在印度尼西亚或其他国家，无论是流离失所，无法谋生，或不愿继续在当地居留下去的侨胞全部回国，为了子孙万代的幸福，在广东省参加祖国的社会主义建设事业！回来几十万、几百万，我们都一样欢迎！事实会证明：我们不仅可以，而且会妥善地安排他们的生活和工作，使他们每一个人都心情舒畅地、无忧无虑地和国内人民一道共同建设伟大的祖国，和美好的家乡！
