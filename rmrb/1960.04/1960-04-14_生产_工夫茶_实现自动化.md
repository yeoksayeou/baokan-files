Achieving Automation in "Gongfu Tea" Production

In the past, producing "Gongfu Tea" required thirty-two processes, almost all of which were manual operations. Therefore, people called this type of tea "Gongfu Tea," meaning it required a lot of effort. After achieving automation, 2,100 people were saved, and work efficiency increased more than twenty-one times. The workers said: "Automated tea making is truly novel, the workers are happily smiling, press a button and sit aside, enjoying the tea taking an elevator." Lin Yixin and Hou Zhenya, representatives of the Fu'an Tea Factory, discuss the factory's automation process.

Chairman, fellow representatives:

Under the leadership of the Party, the Fu'an Tea Factory in Fujian Province armed all its employees with Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution, launching a mass movement for technological revolution. With self-reliance and indigenous methods, they accomplished what predecessors could not, transforming the factory from manual operation to full-process automation. The number of workers decreased from more than 2,800 to the current 700-plus, while tea-making efficiency increased by more than 21.8 times on the original basis, becoming a red banner in the national tea industry's mass movement for technological revolution.

Does "Gongfu Tea" necessarily require effort?

The factory is famous for producing the "Tanyang Gongfu Tea," known both domestically and abroad. After the raw tea arrived at the factory, it had to be processed into four grades and twenty-six categories of tea. Before the full-process automation was achieved, each grade of tea had to go through eight processes, totaling thirty-two. The manual operation part accounted for 93% of the factory workload, with the exception of a small amount of screening and drying that were done by machines. More than two thousand female tea pickers had to stare at the dark tea leaves all day long, constantly picking out tea stems and other debris as thin as needles. The tea carriers had to carry more than two hundred loads of tea up and down every day, making their backs ache. The workers used to say: "Manual tea making is truly troublesome, carrying tea on shoulders and running back and forth, picking tea non-stop with both hands, eyes blurred and backs aching, production is slow." Therefore, the workers urgently demanded technological reforms to quickly relieve the heavy physical labor and thoroughly change the backward situation of long production cycles, high costs, and poor quality.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, tea production has developed rapidly, and the contradiction between processing tasks and equipment and labor has become increasingly acute. According to the development of the situation, the factory's Party branch believed that the fundamental way to solve the contradiction was to liberate thinking and launch a mass movement for technological revolution. However, a few people believed that to complete the Great Leap Forward task, the factory had to expand the plant, add equipment, and increase the number of workers by two thousand. They said: "Gongfu Tea is made with handcraft skills, what kind of Gongfu Tea would it be with machines!" "How can a bumpkin engage in foreign science?" To unify the thinking of all employees, the tea factory's Party branch organized six major debates and screened newsreels about science and technology to help the masses break through mysterious ideas. After the education of the Party organization, the vast majority of people liberated their thinking, believing that "nothing is difficult in the world for those who set their minds to it," and that as long as they exert their efforts and study hard, they can definitely achieve mechanization and automation. The Party branch then established a "Science and Technology Research Committee"; the two workshops also established research groups headed by the branch secretaries. Focusing on the key and weak links in production, the Party branch proposed four major topics: how to simplify the process, how to mechanize sorting and packaging, how to automate refining, and how to improve product quality, pointing out the main direction of technological innovation and revolution for all employees.

With a clear direction, the workers in the factory began to use their brains around the key issues; many people became "innovation fanatics" who thought about it day and night. Li Qingqi, the deputy director of the workshop who came from a worker background, first analyzed the situation of the screening section and proposed the suggestion of "simplifying the process, uniting machines, installing conveyor belts, and changing semi-mechanized production to semi-automated production." The Party branch took effective measures to fully support this suggestion. With the collaboration and support of the entire factory, the second workshop spent only twenty days completing the relocation and installation of machines, reducing the original fifteen processes to seven, changing the old-fashioned single-operation machines into combined operation machines, achieving semi-automation of screening, saving 70% of the labor force, and increasing work efficiency by more than one time.

After the semi-automation of the screening section, some people became complacent, thinking that the technological innovation had almost been completed, but the Party branch and the majority of workers believed that they should advance on the victory and continuously revolutionize. Moreover, production is linked one by one. After the semi-automation of the screening section, it brought new imbalances in production. The drying section could not fully supply raw materials, and manual picking of the screened products could not keep up. The Party branch immediately proposed that "timely elimination of manual picking is the key to saving labor, improving work efficiency, and achieving full-process automation." The workers exerted their efforts again, found the picking machines that had been idle for many years due to inapplicability and modified them, increasing the machine picking degree by 50%. With the aid of manual picking, the factory could basically keep up with the production needs; the drying section also focused on rational layout and implemented machine relocation; the packaging section built native machines to replace manual operations. Thus, the factory achieved mechanization of manual operations and semi-automation of mechanical operations. At this time, the number of workers in the factory decreased from more than two thousand eight hundred to more than one thousand five hundred, and work efficiency increased by more than five times.

Advance on the victory, achieve full-process automation to the end

The initial achievements of technological reform profoundly educated all the workers in the factory. Everyone felt that the potential of the factory was endless, and the Great Leap Forward had no limits. The Party branch then issued the battle call to "advance on the victory, go all the way, and achieve full-process automation." However, to achieve full-process automation, three key problems had to be solved: first, further machine integration and relocation, but the factory building was not large enough (the existing factory building was only 503 square meters, and at least 820 square meters were needed according to the full-process automation plan); second, all machines needed to be re-modified, and more than 20 new machines had to be manufactured, but the raw materials and technical strength were insufficient, especially the steel plate supply was difficult; third, the picking machine did not pick tea thoroughly, and manual labor was still needed, so finally eliminating manual picking was the key of the key. After the problems were put forward, the Party branch launched a "recruitment notice" and held a "Zhuge Liang meeting" to concentrate the wisdom of the masses to break through each problem one by one. The workers proposed the suggestion of "going to heaven and earth," changing the machines to a trapezoidal design, and adopting the method of "hanging in the air, installing on the ground, and digging underground" to improve the utilization rate of the factory building and properly solve the difficulty of insufficient factory building. In overcoming the second key, the workers proposed the suggestion of "using hardwood instead of steel" and made machines by themselves. As a result, the workers completed the manufacture and modification of automated machines without asking the state for any materials. Finally, only the difficulty of how to use machines to pick out tea stems as thin as needles remained. Breaking through this difficulty would save one thousand four hundred female workers who did manual picking. The secretary of the Party branch personally took command and, after studying with electricians, old tea workers, and technicians for many times, believed that the water content of tea stems and tea leaves was different, and the principle of "damp electricity conduction" could be used to manufacture an electrostatic stem-absorbing machine to solve the problem. At this time, someone in the factory heard that Japan had exhibited such a machine in Wuhan, China, saying that it was a "cutting-edge scientific machine" that could only be viewed from a distance and not approached, and even less explained how to manufacture it. The employees said: "If capitalist countries can manufacture it, why can't our socialist country?" The determination was made, but there were still many difficulties. They did not know the structure and principle of the machine, they lacked basic knowledge of electricity, and they did not have telecommunications equipment. However, these difficulties did not scare people with great ambitions. They adopted indigenous methods as the main method, combining indigenous and foreign methods. The equipment could be used as substitutes, and the equipment that could be borrowed was borrowed. Only when they could not borrow it did they buy it; and they took the opportunity of borrowing and buying to learn from others, borrowing one thing to learn one thing, buying one thing to ask one thing, painstakingly learning and mastering the scientific and technical knowledge they urgently needed; and they established a "Static Electricity Stem Absorption Machine Test Record Book," learning from failures. Finally, the factory succeeded in the twenty-third test, completely eliminating manual picking and realizing full-process automation. Now, walking into the factory building of the Fu'an Tea Factory, you can see dozens of machines arranged in a stepped manner connected to form a production line, with only a few workers sitting quietly on chairs. When they press a button, these machines start turning at the same time, and the raw tea that needs to be processed automatically flows from this process to that process along the conveyor belt, and is automatically processed, classified, and packed into boxes through drying, screening, picking, batching, and automated processing, becoming fragrant fine tea. The workers composed a clapper rhyme saying: "Automated tea making is truly novel, the workers are happily smiling, press a button and sit aside, enjoying the tea taking an elevator."

The equipment used for automation is mostly made by ourselves

In the process of achieving full-process automation, the Fu'an Tea Factory manufactured a total of 28 various machines, including the electrostatic stem absorption machine. Except for a few parts such as electronic tubes, ammeters, enameled wires, and silicon steel sheets that were bought from the market, most of them were self-reliant and made with indigenous methods. Due to the realization of full-process automation, the number of workers in the factory decreased from more than two thousand eight hundred to more than seven hundred, and work efficiency increased by 21.8 times. The output and quality of products have also greatly improved. At present, they are further designing advanced full-process automation. After this plan is realized, the number of employees in the factory can be reduced from more than seven hundred to about fifty.

The realization of production automation, if in a capitalist country, would bring the disaster of unemployment to a large number of workers and bring greater profits to capitalists. However, in our socialist country, the realization of production automation not only improves labor productivity and improves the working conditions of workers, but also improves the cultural and material life of workers. The Party and the state have properly arranged for the large number of workers replaced by machines in the tea factory. In addition to a part of them who have been transferred to work in factories and enterprises such as machine factories, motor factories, and construction companies, they have also made comprehensive use of the factory's conditions and established seven subsidiary workshops such as machine repair, wood tar refining, and activated carbon, further expanding the scope of production and creating more wealth for the society.

The fact that the Fu'an Tea Factory was able to achieve production mechanization and full-process automation by relying on a large number of workers engaged in manual labor, using indigenous methods, without increasing factory buildings, machinery, and state investment, and with a severe lack of engineering and technical personnel and raw materials, once again strongly proves a truth: The "lowly" are the most intelligent. At the same time, it also vividly proves that the realization of mechanized and automated production is not a mysterious and distant future event. As long as there is strong leadership from the Party, a lofty ambition, hard work, painstaking research, and bold creation, it is entirely possible to strive to achieve it in a relatively short period of time. The success of the technological revolution in the Fu'an Tea Factory shines with the light of the Party's general line, reflecting the infinite wisdom of the Chinese working class; their advanced deeds are the victory of the Party's leadership, the victory of carrying out mass movements, and even more the glorious victory of Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution!

    生产“工夫茶”实现自动化
    过去生产“工夫茶”要经过三十二道工序，几乎全部是手工操作，因此人们把这种茶叶叫做花工夫的“工夫茶”。实现自动化以后，人员节省二千一百人，工效提高二十一倍多。工人说：自动制茶真新奇，工人乐得笑嘻嘻，电钮一按旁边坐，欣赏茶叶坐电梯。林一心、侯振亚代表谈福安茶厂生产自动化经过主席、各位代表：
    福建省福安茶厂在党的领导下，以毛主席的不断革命思想武装全体职工，大闹技术革命的群众运动。他们以自力更生、土法上马的办法，干出了前人所不能干的事，使该厂从手工操作一跃实现了生产全程自动化，工人从二千八百多人减少到目前的七百多人，制茶工效却在原有基础上提高了二十一点八倍，成为全国茶厂大闹技术革命的一面红旗。
      “工夫茶”一定要费工夫吗？
    该厂是精制闻名中外的“坦洋工夫茶”的工厂，毛茶到厂后要加工成四等二十六类茶叶，在实现生产全程自动化以前，每一等茶叶要经过八道工序，算起来总共是三十二道工序，而全厂除了筛分和干燥有少量机器外，手工操作部分占了93％，那时全厂两千多名拣茶女工整天要两眼盯住乌黑的茶叶，两手不停地拣出像针尖一般的茶梗和其它杂物；扛茶工平均每人每天要扛上搬下两百多担茶叶，累得腰酸背痛。工人们曾这样说：“手工制茶真麻烦，肩挑脚跑来回搬，两手不停来拣茶，眼花腰痛生产慢。”因此，工人们迫切要求进行技术改革，迅速解除笨重的体力劳动，彻底改变生产周期长、成本高、质量差的落后面貌。
    1958年大跃进以来，茶叶生产迅速发展，加工任务和设备、劳力的矛盾日益尖锐起来。根据形势的发展，厂党总支认为解决矛盾的根本办法是解放思想，大搞技术革命的群众运动。可是有少数人却认为要完成跃进任务，就得扩建厂房，添置设备，增加两千名工人。他们说：“工夫茶就是靠手艺工夫做出来的，靠机器还像什么工夫茶！”“土包子，怎么能搞洋科学？”为了统一全厂职工的思想认识，茶厂总支组织干部、技术员和工人开展了六次大辩论并放映有关科学技术的新闻影片，帮助群众打破神秘思想。经过党组织的教育，绝大多数人解放了思想，认为“天下无难事，只怕有心人”，只要鼓足干劲，刻苦钻研，就一定能实现机械化、自动化。党总支就成立了“科学技术研究委员会”；两个车间也以支部书记挂帅成立了研究小组。针对生产上的关键与薄弱环节，提出工艺过程如何简化、拣剔和包装如何机械化、精制如何自动化、产品质量如何提高等四大课题，为全厂职工群众指出了技术革新和技术革命的主攻方向。
    主攻方向明确，全厂工人纷纷围绕关键开动脑筋；许多人成了朝思夜想的“革新迷”。工人出身的车间副主任李庆祺，首先分析了筛分工段的情况，提出了“工序大简化、机器大联合、装设输送带、变半机械化生产为半自动化生产”的建议。党总支采取了有效措施，全力支持这个建议。在全厂的协作支援下，第二车间只花了二十多天时间就完成了机器搬家和安装，把原来十五道工序减少到七道，把旧式单项作业机改成联合作业机，实现了筛分半自动化，节省了70％的劳力，还提高了工效一倍多。
    筛分工段实现半自动化后，一部分人产生自满情绪，认为技术革新搞得差不多了，但是党总支和大多数工人却认为要乘胜前进，不断革命。而且生产是一环扣一环的，筛分工段实现半自动化后，带来了生产上新的不平衡，干燥工段不能充分供应原料，筛分出来的产品手工拣剔也来不及。党总支立即提出“及时消灭手工拣剔，是节省劳力、提高工效、实现全程自动化的关键”。工人们再鼓干劲，把多年来因不适用而搁闲的拣剔机找出来加以改装，使机器拣剔程度提高50％，再辅以手工拣剔，基本可跟上生产需要；干燥工段也以合理布局为主要内容，实行机器大搬家；包装工段则大造土机器以代替手工操作。实现了手工操作机械化，机械操作半自动化。这时，全厂工人从二千八百多人减少到一千五百多人，工效提高了五倍多。
      乘胜前进，一化到底实现全程自动化
    技术改革的初步成就，深刻地教育了全厂工人，大家都感到厂里的潜力无底，跃进无边。党总支又发出了“乘胜前进，一化到底，实现全程自动化”的战斗号召。但是要实现全程自动化，必须解决三个关键问题：一是进一步实现机器大联合、大搬家，而厂房却不够（现有厂房只五百零三平方米，按全程自动化方案至少要八百二十平方米）；二是全部机器需要重新改造，还要新制二十多台机器，但原材料和技术力量不足，特别是钢板供应有困难；三是拣剔机拣茶不彻底，还要辅以手工劳动，因而最后消灭手工拣剔是关键的关键。问题摆开以后，党总支搞起“招贤榜”开“诸葛亮会”，集中群众智慧来逐个攻破。工人们提出了“上天入地”的建议，把机器改为梯形设计，采取“空中吊、平地装，地下挖”三头并进的办法，提高了厂房利用率，妥善地解决了厂房不足的困难。在攻克第二个关键时，工人们又提出了“以硬木代钢”的建议，自己动手造机器。结果没有向国家要任何材料，完成了自动化机器的制造和改装。最后，只剩下如何用机器拣剔像针一样细小的茶梗这一难关了。能打破这一关，就能节省一千四百个手工拣剔的女工。党总支书记亲自挂帅上阵，与电工、老茶工和技术人员多次研究后，认为茶梗和茶叶的含水量不同，可以用“潮湿导电”的原理，制造静电吸梗机解决。这时厂里有人听说日本曾在我国武汉展出过一台这样的机器，说是“尖端科学机器”，只能远看不能近观，更不说明制造方法。职工们说：“资本主义国家能制造，我们社会主义国家为什么不能？”决心是下了，但是仍然困难重重，一不知道机器构造原理，二缺乏电学基本知识，三没有电讯器材。可是这些困难并没有吓住有着雄心壮志的人，他们采取土法为主，土洋结合的办法，器材能代用就代用，能借用的就借用，借不到的才去买；并利用借和买的机会拜师访友，借一样学一样，买一样问一样，费尽苦心地学习掌握他们迫切需要的科学技术知识；并建立起“静电吸梗机试验记录簿”，从失败中找经验，终于在第二十三次试验中获得成功，彻底消灭了手工拣剔，实现了生产全程自动化。现在走进福安茶厂的厂房，一眼看去是几十台梯次排列的机器联成一条作业线，只有几个工人安详地坐在椅子上。他们一按电钮，这些机器便同时转动起来，需要加工的毛茶随着输送带自动地由这个工序流到那个工序，经过干燥、筛分、拣剔、匀堆、自动地加工、分类、装箱，成为芳香扑鼻的精茶。工人们编了一首快板说：“自动制茶真新奇，工人乐得笑嘻嘻，电钮一按旁边坐，欣赏茶叶坐电梯。”
      自动化使用的设备绝大部分是自己做的
    福安茶厂在实现生产全程自动化的过程中，包括制造静电吸梗机在内，共自造了二十八台各种机器，这些机器除了电子管、电表、漆包线、矽钢片等少数零件是从市场上买来的外，绝大部分是自力更生，用土办法造出来的。由于实现了生产全程自动化，全厂工人从二千八百多人减少到七百多人，工效提高了二十一点八倍。产品产量和质量也有很大提高。目前他们又在进一步设计高级全程自动化，这个计划实现以后，全厂职工又可从七百多人减少到五十人左右。
    生产自动化的实现，如果在资本主义国家里，就会给大批工人带来失业的灾难，给资本家带来更大的利润。但是在我们社会主义国家里，实现生产自动化不仅提高了劳动生产率，改善了工人的劳动条件，而且提高了工人的文化和物质生活。茶厂用机器代替下来的大批工人，党和国家给予了妥善的安排。其中除了一部分已转到机器厂、电机厂、建筑公司等工厂企业工作外，还根据该厂条件，大搞综合利用，办起了机器修配、提炼木焦油、活性炭等七个附属车间，进一步扩大了生产范围，为社会创造更多的财富。
    福安茶厂在没有增加厂房、机器设备和国家投资，以及在没有工程技术人员，原材料十分缺乏的情况下，依靠一大批从事手工劳动的工人，能够用土法上马的办法实现生产机械化和全程自动化的事，再一次强有力地证实了一个真理：“卑贱”的人最聪明。同时也活生生地证明着，实现机械化、自动化生产并不是神秘的、遥远的将来的事，只要有党的坚强领导，树立雄心大志，发奋图强，刻苦钻研，大胆创造，就完全可以在较短的时间内争取实现。福安茶厂技术革命的成功，闪烁着党的总路线的光芒，反映了我国工人阶级有着无穷无尽的智慧；他们创造的先进事迹，是党的领导的胜利，是大搞群众运动的胜利，更是毛主席不断革命思想的光辉胜利！
