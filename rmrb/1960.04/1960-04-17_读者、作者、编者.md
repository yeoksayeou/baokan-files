    More Reports on Teachers' Work Experience

    The report "Diligently Cultivating Communist Seedlings—'Love Diary' of Teachers at Yaoshao Elementary School" on page 3 of the People's Daily on April 3rd was a very meaningful report. I was very moved after reading it, as if I had attended a profound and practical lesson. Comrade Ye Guijun's spirit of caring for students and patiently educating them, and her method of using all favorable opportunities to educate students according to their age characteristics, are of practical significance to us. I used her method to educate students and it really achieved good results. I hope the newspaper will frequently report on advanced figures and advanced work methods in the teaching ranks.

    A Good Article

    The article "Mao Zedong Thought Illuminates the Path of Film Creation" by Comrade Zheng Junli, published in the People's Daily on March 22nd, is a good article. Based on his personal experience in creating the film "Lin Zexu," the artist vividly expounded how he specifically applied Mao Zedong Thought to solve many fundamental problems in film creation, thereby correctly handling the unity of historical truth and artistic truth, the role of individuals and the masses in history, the progressive role and limitations of historical figures, the relationship between major and minor contradictions, and other important issues. This is not only of universal significance for the creation of historical films, but also of great help to people in studying Chairman Mao's works in connection with reality.

    Regarding "Rhapsodies on Famous Cities"

    The People's Daily supplement opened a "Rhapsodies on Famous Cities" column from August last year, describing the tremendous changes in many large and medium-sized cities in the motherland during the socialist era, reflecting the pace of the socialist construction great leap forward. In the past six months, the editorial department has continuously received letters from readers, supporting and encouraging this column, hoping that it will appear frequently, and hoping to compile and publish what has already been published.

    We accept the request of our readers and decide to make "Rhapsodies on Famous Cities" a regular column of the supplement. In addition to large and medium-sized cities, it will also reflect the new look of many emerging cities and historically famous cities in the motherland. The published and prepared articles will be edited and published in separate volumes by the People's Daily Publishing House.

      A Suggestion

    The news "Compatriots on Mauritius Island Suffer from Wind Disaster, Overseas Chinese Federation Allocates Relief Funds and Sends Condolences" published on page 4 of the People's Daily on April 3rd did not specify which country Mauritius Island belongs to or where it is located. It is suggested that the newspaper should provide a simple introduction to place names that are rarely reported in the future.

    Mauritius Island is an island in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa and is currently a British colony.

    In the future, when unfamiliar terms and things appear in the international version, we will provide the necessary introductions for readers' reference.

    多报道教师的工作经验
    人民日报4月3日第三版“辛勤培植共产主义的幼苗——雅韶小学教师的‘爱生日记’”，是一篇很有意义的报道。读后很受感动，像上了一堂深刻而实际的课。叶桂钧同志那种爱护学生、耐心教育学生的精神，按照儿童的年龄特征，利用一切有利机会来教育学生的方法，对我们来说是很有实际意义的。我运用她的方法来教育学生，果然收到良好效果。希望报纸对教师队伍中的先进人物和先进的工作方法，经常作些报道。

    一篇好文章
    3月22日人民日报发表的郑君里同志的“毛泽东思想照亮了电影创作的道路”，是一篇好文章。艺术家根据自己在创作“林则徐”这部电影中的切身体会，生动地阐明了他如何具体运用毛泽东思想来解决电影创作上的许多根本性问题，从而正确地处理了历史真实和艺术真实的统一性、个人和群众在历史上的作用、历史人物的进步作用和局限性、主要矛盾和次要矛盾的关系等等重要问题。这不仅对创作历史影片有普遍意义，而且对人们联系实际学习毛主席著作，也有很大的帮助。　辽宁　陈宗华
       欢迎“要闻快报”
     人民日报新辟的“要闻快报”栏，使我们及时了解祖国建设飞跃发展的新面貌。我们看了这些文字简短、内容丰富的报道，就像看到各个战线上的捷报一样，受到莫大鼓舞。

    关于“名城赋”
    人民日报副刊从去年8月起开辟了“名城赋”一栏，描述祖国许多大中城市在社会主义时代的巨大变化，反映了社会主义建设大跃进的步伐。半年以来，编辑部不断收到读者的来信，支持和鼓励这一栏，希望它经常出现，并且希望把已经发表的编印出版。
    我们接受读者同志的要求，决定把“名城赋”作为副刊的一个经常性的专栏，除大中城市外，它还要反映祖国许多新兴城市、历史名城的新面貌。已发表和准备陆续发表的文章，将由人民日报出版社分册编辑出版。　编　者
      一个建议
    人民日报4月3日第四版刊载“毛里求斯岛侨胞受风灾之害，我侨联拨款救济并致电慰问”的新闻，但没有写明毛里求斯岛属于哪个国家，在什么地方。建议报纸今后对很少报道的地名，最好能加以简单的介绍。　胡道荣等
                  ＊　＊
    毛里求斯岛是靠近非洲东岸的印度洋上的一个岛屿，现为英国殖民地。
    今后在国际版出现一般读者所不熟悉的专门名称和事物时，我们将尽可能作必要的介绍，供读者参考。　编　者
