The Zanzibar people, encouraged by the rising tide of African national independence movements, are also striving to wage a struggle for independence.

Zanzibar, located on the east coast of Africa, is the world-famous "Clove Island," producing 20 million pounds of cloves annually, accounting for more than 80% of the world's total production. This Muslim Sultanate, composed of the two islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, with a population of 300,000, was occupied by Britain in 1890 and became its "protectorate." The Sultan of Zanzibar is controlled by a British-appointed Resident.

For seventy years, British imperialism has carried out cruel oppression and exploitation of the Zanzibar people. In order to maintain its "divide and rule" policy, British colonialists divided the people of Zanzibar into many tribes. Britain controlled all of Zanzibar's import and export trade. Although Zanzibar could buy cheaper goods from other countries, Britain stubbornly prohibited Zanzibar from importing any goods from any country other than those it designated. Due to Britain's insatiable plunder, Zanzibar's economy has long been backward, and the people's lives are miserable.

In order to continue to maintain British colonial rule, the British authorities put forward so-called "constitutional reform" proposals in October 1955, which stipulated that of the twenty-five members of the Legislative Council, only six would be elected, and the others would be appointed by the British authorities. The qualifications for voters in the elections were also very strict. This deceptive "constitutional reform" was, of course, resolutely opposed by the people of Zanzibar. They demanded that all members of the Legislative Council be elected and that political and economic independence be realized. Now, the British government is trying to play the trick of "constitutional reform" in Zanzibar again. But the people of Zanzibar have long seen through the colonialists' conspiracy. They will never be fooled.

In recent years, the people of Zanzibar have launched a resolute struggle against British colonial rule. In 1955, the people held demonstrations and boycotts to protest the British appointment of members of the Legislative Council. In December 1957, representatives of the Zanzibar people at the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference denounced British oppression and put forward just demands for support for the Zanzibar people's struggle for independence. In early 1959, 75,000 people, a quarter of the country's population, launched a struggle against the colonial education bill. Now, the people of Zanzibar are continuing their unyielding struggle to achieve independence in 1960. (Qing)

    “丁香岛”上的斗争
    在非洲民族独立运动日益高涨的鼓舞下，桑给巴尔人民也正在努力展开争取独立的斗争。
    桑给巴尔位于非洲东岸，是世界闻名的“丁香岛”，年产丁香二千万磅，占世界总产量的80％以上。这个由桑给巴尔和奔巴两岛组成的人口三十万的穆斯林苏丹国，在1890年被英国占领，成为它的“保护国”。桑给巴尔的苏丹受英国派遣的驻节长官控制。
    七十年来，英帝国主义对桑给巴尔人民进行了残酷的压迫和剥削。英国殖民者为了保持其“分而治之”的政策，把桑给巴尔的人民划分为许多部落。英国控制了桑给巴尔全部进口和出口贸易。虽然桑给巴尔可以从其他国家买到价格便宜的货物，但英国郤横蛮地禁止桑给巴尔从它指定以外的任何国家进口任何货物。由于英国贪得无厌的掠夺，桑给巴尔的经济长期落后，人民生活困苦不堪。
    为了继续维持英国的殖民统治，英国当局在1955年10月提出所谓“宪法改革”建议，其中规定立法会议的二十五名议员中，只有六名由选举产生，其他都要由英国当局指派。选举中对选民资格限制也很严。这种欺骗性的“宪法改革”当然遭到了桑给巴尔人民的坚决反对。他们要求立法会议成员全部由选举产生，并且要求实现政治上和经济上的独立。现在，英国政府又企图在桑给巴尔重新玩弄“宪法改革”的把戏。但是桑给巴尔人民早已识破了殖民主义者的阴谋。他们是决不会受骗的。
    近年来，桑给巴尔人民展开了反对英国殖民统治的坚决斗争。1955年，人民举行了示威和抵制运动，抗议英国任命立法会议的成员。1957年12月，桑给巴尔人民代表在亚非人民团结大会上控诉英国的压迫，提出了关于支持桑给巴尔人民争取独立的正义要求。1959年初，占全国人口四分之一的七万五千人掀起了反对殖民教育法案的斗争。现在，桑给巴尔人民正在为争取在1960年内获得独立继续进行着不屈的斗争。　（庆）
