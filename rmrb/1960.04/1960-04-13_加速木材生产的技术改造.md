    Technical Transformation to Accelerate Timber Production
    Timber occupies a very important position in the national economy. Accelerating the technical transformation of timber production and further meeting the needs of all sectors for timber is an urgent problem that forestry departments need to solve. At present, manual labor still accounts for a considerable proportion of timber production across the country, and the phenomenon of carrying by human shoulders and hauling by cattle and horses is relatively common. In many forest areas, contradictions often arise between agriculture and forestry competing for labor during the busy farming seasons. Manual labor not only has high costs, but more importantly, the timber needed by the state cannot be produced quickly. Facts have proven that units that use machinery for operations and have a relatively high degree of mechanization have higher labor productivity and relatively lower costs. At present, the labor productivity (average annual production level per worker) of the national forest industry is generally ninety cubic meters, and the cost is about twenty-four yuan. The timber turnover time requires two hundred days. However, in the Linjiang Forest Industry Bureau of Jilin Province, which has already achieved mechanized, semi-mechanized, and continuous operations, the labor productivity is 234.54 cubic meters, and the cost is 9.94 yuan. The timber turnover time is three to five days. From this, it can be seen that accelerating the technical transformation of timber production is a very important matter.
    The current technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the forest industry should revolve around the five links of collection, loading, preparation, binding, and towing. Collection refers to the collection and linkage of timber; loading is to load timber onto vehicles; preparation is the preparation work for logging; binding is the binding of rafts; towing is the towing of rafts (the first three links belong to land operation procedures, and the latter two links refer to water transport operations). These five procedures are currently the procedures in timber production that consume more manpower and animal power and have a larger workload, and are the key to whether timber production can continue to make great leaps forward. If these five procedures achieve mechanized and semi-mechanized operations, timber production in various parts of China, both north and south, will basically be able to form a complete set, achieving continuous production. This is the main direction of attack for the current large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution in the forest industry. It is hoped that forest industry departments in various regions will earnestly mobilize the masses, implement the policy of self-reliance and combining indigenous and foreign methods, and achieve this goal as soon as possible, pushing China's timber production to a new level.

### 加速木材生产的技术改造

    加速木材生产的技术改造
    木材在国民经济中占着十分重要的地位。加速木材生产的技术改造，进一步满足各方面对木材的需要，是林业部门当前迫切需要解决的问题。现在手工作业在全国的木材生产中还占着相当大的比重，人抬肩扛、牛拖马拉的现象比较普遍。许多林区每到农忙季节，往往出现农业、林业争劳力的矛盾。手工作业，不仅成本高，更重要的是国家所需要的木材不能迅速生产出来。事实证明，使用机具作业和机械化程度比较高的单位，劳动生产率就比较高，成本相对下降。现在全国森林工业的劳动生产率（每个工人年平均生产水平）一般为九十立方米，成本为二十四元左右。木材流转时间需要二百天。而已经实现了机械化、半机械化、连续化作业的吉林省临江森林工业局，劳动生产率是二百三十四点五四立方米，成本是九点九四元。木材流转时间是三至五天。由此可见，加速木材生产的技术改造，是一件十分重要的事情。
    当前森林工业的技术革新和技术革命运动，应该围绕集、装、准、编、拖五个环节进行。集是集联木材；装是将木材装上车；准是伐木的准备作业；编是编扎木排；拖是轮拖木排（前三个环节属于陆地作业工序，后两个环节指水运作业）。这五道工序是目前木材生产中占用人力和畜力较多、工作量较大的工序，是木材生产能否继续大跃进的关键。这五道工序如果实现了机械化半机械化作业，我国南北各地的木材生产将基本上可以配套成龙，实现生产连续化。这是目前森林工业大闹技术革新和技术革命的主攻方向。希望各地森林工业部门认真发动群众，执行自力更生、土洋并举的方针，尽快地实现这个目标，把我国的木材生产推向一个新的水平。
