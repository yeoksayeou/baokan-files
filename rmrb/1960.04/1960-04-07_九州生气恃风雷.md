The Land of China Is Vibrant, Relying on Wind and Thunder
    Li Dongsheng
    Recently, due to work opportunities, I had the chance to take a "cursory glance" at some people's communes in Anhui Province. It was truly a scene of vibrant spring, with so much to see. Thanks to large-scale technical innovation, the cotton in Huanglu People's Commune in Chaoxian County had dense and strong fruit branches and produced many large cotton bolls last year. Good cotton grew on large areas of upland. The Chahua Commune in Fuyang has generally used biogas for fuel and lighting, and is solving the problem of using biogas as a power source for tractors, and is praised as "the flower of biogas." More than 20,000 mu of barren land in the Patriotic Commune of Shouxian County has been turned into fertile fields, and the seriously harmful rice stem borer has been basically eradicated. The new rice variety adapted to local natural conditions, cultivated by the commune's scientific research institute, is undergoing second-generation testing and has become a well-known "flower of scientific research." …
    If one did not understand the situation, seeing those amazing achievements, one might think they were the research results of agronomists or engineers. Indeed, in every commune I visited, I met many agronomists and engineers, but they were all new types of experts, experts who grew up rapidly after the establishment of the people's communes, in the large-scale scientific research activities. A young woman named Zhu Lihua was illiterate before the establishment of the commune. Now, she has not only become an expert in cotton planting and cotton pest control, but also created an automatic ditching, seeding, and covering sowing machine. She is also able to read popular science and technology readings. The commune members praised these "native experts," praising them for being both courageous in their physical efforts and good at using their intelligence.
    Why can the broad masses of working people master scientific and technological knowledge, invent, and become experts of our era in such a short period of time? Overnight, the spring breeze has brought ten thousand trees into bloom. It is the Party's General Line that inspires the high-spirited fighting will of the broad masses of working people and illuminates their thinking, enabling their communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act to be greatly developed. It is precisely the spring breeze and rain that irrigates the strong new buds, blooming the red flowers of technological innovation. However, going from illiteracy to reading scientific and technological readings, from not understanding science and technology to mastering science and technology, is by no means achieved overnight. From the "native experts," we see three ordinary truths:
    First, diligent study. They all have the spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," willing to use their brains and work hard. In order to study technology, they concentrate, forget to eat and sleep, and study hard. Because they put in the effort, they can "grind an iron rod into a needle." Second, relying on the collective. They humbly listen to other people's opinions, are good at learning from others, ask when they don't understand, learn when they can't do it, and when they encounter difficulties, they put them forward for everyone to offer ideas and think of solutions. "One person has one idea, three people come up with a great idea." By concentrating the wisdom of the masses, any problem can be solved easily. Third, persevere to the end. They are not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of failure. They do not bow their heads when encountering difficulties, and they are not discouraged by failure. When they encounter setbacks, they actively look for the reasons for the failure, study countermeasures, make persistent efforts, and move forward bravely. With this revolutionary spirit, climbing the peak of culture and technology is naturally not a problem. These three ordinary truths run through a bright and dazzling red line, that is, a red heart for the Party, for the people, and for socialism. With a red heart dedicated to completely changing the impoverished and backward outlook and to realizing socialism and communism at an early date, they will regard innovation and creation as a collective undertaking, drilling down firmly and tenaciously to the end, and never giving up until the goal is achieved. "The word 'do' comes first, the word 'drill' is in command, don't forget the word 'think,' and throw away the word 'fear'" is the most vivid portrayal of the mental state of thousands of "native experts."
    "The Land of China Is Vibrant, Relying on Wind and Thunder." This exciting fact marks the great march of the broad masses of working people in our country to overcome cultural and scientific backwardness and create socialist culture and science. It marks the vigorous advance of the broad masses of working people in our country on the road of cultural revolution and technological revolution. What follows will surely be a more beautiful future.

    九州生气恃风雷
    李冬生
    最近由于工作的机会，曾到安徽省的一些人民公社“走马看花”，真是满园春色，使人目不暇及。由于大搞技术革新，去年巢县黄麓公社的棉花，果枝长得又密又壮，棉桃结得又多又大，在大片岗地上长出了好棉花。阜阳插花公社已经普遍使用沼气作燃料和照明，并且正在解决拖拉机利用沼气作动力的问题，而被誉为“沼气之花”。寿县爱国公社两万多亩瘠地已经变成良田，危害严重的螟虫已经基本绝迹，公社科学研究所培养的适应当地自然条件的水稻新品种，已在进行第二代试验，成为远近闻名的“科学研究之花”。……
    如果不了解情况，看到那些令人惊奇的成就，也许会以为是农学家或者工程师的研究成果。的确，在我到过的每一个公社中，我都碰到过许多农学家和工程师，但是，他们都是新型的专家，都是在人民公社成立以后，在大搞科学研究活动里迅速成长起来的专家。一个名叫朱丽华的青年妇女，在公社成立前还是文盲，现在，不仅成为植棉和防治棉花病虫害的能手，而且创造出自动开沟、下种和盖土的播种机，而且能够阅读通俗的科学技术读物。社员们夸奖这些“土专家”，称赞他们既勇于斗力，又善于斗智。
    广大劳动群众为什么在短短的时间内，就能掌握科学技术知识，进行发明创造而成为我们时代的专家呢？一夜春风，万树花开，正是党的总路线鼓舞着广大劳动群众的昂扬斗志，照亮了他们的思想，使得他们的敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格得到大大发扬。正是春风化雨，雨水灌溉着茁壮的新芽，开放出技术革新的红花。但是，从目不识丁到阅读科学技术读物，从不懂科学技术到掌握科学技术，也决不是一蹴而就的。从“土专家”们的身上，我们看到的是三条平凡的真理：
    一是刻苦钻研。他们都有“愚公移山”的精神，肯于动脑筋，下苦功。为了钻研技术，他们聚精会神，废寝忘食，苦学苦钻。由于他们功夫下得深，所以能把“铁杵磨成针”。二是依靠集体。他们虚心听取别人的意见，善于向别人学习，不懂就问，不会就学，遇到困难就摆出来请大家出主意、想点子。“一人一个计，三人出个大主意”，集中群众的智慧，任何难题自可迎刃而解。三是坚持到底。他们不怕困难，不怕失败，遇到困难不低头，遭到失败不灰心，碰到挫折，就积极寻找所以失败的原因，研究对策，再接再厉，勇往直前，有了这种革命的气概，攀登文化技术高峰，自然不在话下。这三条平凡的真理，贯穿着一根光辉夺目的红线，那就是一颗为党、为人民、为社会主义的红心。有了一颗为着彻底改变贫困落后面貌，为着社会主义、共产主义早日实现的红心，就会把革新创造看作集体的事业，既坚又韧地钻下去，钻到底，不达目的，决不罢休。“干字当头，钻字挂帅，想字别忘，怕字丢开”，是千万个“土专家”精神状态最生动的写照。
    “九州生气恃风雷”，这个令人振奋的事实，标志着我国广大劳动人民克服文化科学落后，创造社会主义文化科学的伟大进军，标志着我国广大劳动人民正在文化革命和技术革命的大道上奋勇迈进，随之而来的，一定是一个更加美好的未来。
