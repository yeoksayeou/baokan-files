A Critique of Modern Theme Opera Performances

    "A Spark of Fire" is Inspiring
    Liu Housheng
    The Shanghai opera "A Spark of Fire" creates a strong atmosphere of the 1920s on the stage, leading the audience into the struggle situation before the "May Thirtieth" workers' movement in Shanghai. Reflecting the history of revolutionary struggle in the form of opera, this play has achieved a high level of success.
    The authors created the dramatic image of Yang Guilan, a simple peasant woman who develops into an advanced worker. After her husband dies, she brings her son to Shanghai to find her daughter, who is working as an indentured laborer. With the help of underground party members among the workers, she also gets a job in the factory. But her daughter is kicked to death by a Japanese foreman immediately after they meet; under the leadership of the Party's underground organization, the workers, who have long suffered cruel persecution, erupt in a volcano-like strike. In the struggle, Yang Guilan is educated and helped by party leaders such as Liu Ying and undergoes rigorous tests; when she is kidnapped by a Japanese capitalist and forced to betray the strike, she faces a check and a dagger and resolutely stands up to expose the conspiracy of the bloodsuckers. In the tide of protest against the shooting of Gu Zhenghong, she takes to the streets with everyone and participates in the world-shocking "May Thirtieth" demonstration. The authors poured full of grief and indignation and a high degree of class sympathy into Yang Guilan, and through her experience, broadly reflected the bankruptcy of the Chinese countryside and the poverty of the cities under the economic aggression of imperialism in the mid-1920s, reflected the blood ties between the Chinese working class and the bankrupt peasants, and prominently reflected the heroic spirit of the working class in its life-and-death struggle with imperialism under the leadership of its vanguard. The era of "the mountain rain is about to come, the wind is filling the building" on the eve of the Great Revolution, and the revolutionary truth that the spark of the early workers' movement would inevitably start a prairie fire, are realistically and vividly reproduced on the stage. The significant subject matter, profound theme, full character images, and dramatically structured arrangements give the play a strong artistic appeal and deep ideological and educational effect. For today's audiences, especially young audiences, it can be of great help to them in understanding how their predecessors fought in such difficult circumstances.
    In portraying Yang Guilan's experiences and depicting the workers' struggle, "A Spark of Fire" does not simply list the events or just use dramatic contrasts, repetitions, and emphases to stir up the audience's momentary emotions. The authors put a great deal of effort into excavating and portraying the emotional ups and downs and ideological changes in Yang Guilan's development from a peasant to a revolutionary worker. In the first scene, Yang Guilan sees the emaciated Xiao Zhenzi and knows that she made a big mistake by indenturing her daughter to the foreman. She is full of grief, but she does not dare to deny the power of the indenture, feeling that "the black and white words are in the hands of others, and life and death are not up to me." She can only weep with her daughter across the wall. But when she has been working in the factory for two months, she dares to slap the foreman who is teasing her. After Xiao Zhenzi's tragic death, the workers confront the Japanese foreman head-on, and everyone shouts "Strike!" with righteous indignation. Yang Guilan's deep hatred also makes her shout "I'm on strike!" Although we can see that she is still stuck in personal grudges and lacks true class consciousness. By the fourth scene, she is preparing to take personal revenge, but Liu Ying and others find her, dissuade her, and tell her that the reason for suffering is not fate, but "the unreasonable society where people eat people, imperialism and warlords, the great scourge of the Chinese people." They tell her that "workers rise up in revolution, for the country, for the people, and for themselves, if the cannibalistic society is not destroyed, workers can never turn over." They tell her that "as long as we organize the trade union well and work together in struggle, we workers are in the millions, why should we be afraid of them, a few people?" At this time, Yang Guilan, in the face of the facts of class struggle and under the ideological enlightenment of the Party, begins to "understand a little," and when she hears the news of Gu Zhenghong's murder and everyone is angrily preparing to fight, she can firmly say "Brother Liu, I will go with you!"
    The climax of Yang Guilan's development is in the eighth and ninth scenes, after she is kidnapped. Japanese capitalists and lackeys want her to announce at a press conference that her daughter was not killed by the Japanese, in order to cancel the pretext for the workers' strike. But Yang Guilan's personal grievances have now risen to an irreconcilable class hatred, and the small stream has flowed into the sea. At the same time, she has also learned more fighting skills in the storms of class struggle. She not only smashed the enemy's attack, but also turned around and used the press conference to announce the truth: "It was you, the Japanese, who killed my daughter!" She denounced the heinous crimes of imperialism and its running dogs to the whole society. An ordinary peasant woman is tempered into a proletarian fighting hero in the revolutionary movement.
    The authors do not let go of every turning point in the development of Yang Guilan's thoughts and feelings, and in these places, they give her enough space to vent her emotions as much as possible. This makes "A Spark of Fire" not only have a magnificent momentum in its own artistic style, but also has a delicate carving, and also shows a rich lyrical tone. The duet of mother and daughter across the wall, the duet of Liu Ying and Yang Guilan by the Suzhou River, the resistance during the kidnapping, the denunciation at the press conference, and other scenes are all full of emotion, rushing straight down. The deeper and more genuine the thoughts and feelings of the working people are expressed, the more they can move people's hearts. "A Spark of Fire" basically achieved this. And this is precisely the most important thing in our national opera tradition.
    The stage performance enriched the script even more beautifully. Xiao Aiqin, who has always been good at playing young girls, created the image of Yang Guilan in a moving way here. Her performance is simple and unadorned, accurately grasping the steps of Yang Guilan's character development, the layers are very clear but do not show traces of carving. However, the most important point of her performance achievement is still the clear and strong tendency and sincere and full emotional power in handling the role. Her long singing lyrics, at every moment of excitement, her deep class feelings flow out naturally from her lungs, without artificial squeezing of emotions or empty pursuit of form. There are fewer and fewer impurities in Xiao Aiqin's performance, and she is gradually developing her own performance style, which is very gratifying.
    Shao Binsun's portrayal of Liu Ying and Xie Hongyuan's portrayal of the Japanese Kawamura are also good. From them (and other actors), we can hardly see the vulgar, petty-bourgeois atmosphere that used to be brought from the Shanghai opera stage in the semi-colonial society. Liu Ying is a positive heroic figure, and a little vulgarity would damage the character image. Shao Binsun has grasped this very firmly; and Kawamura is a negative Japanese character, which is easier to fall into vulgarity. Xie Hongyuan did not take the road of superficial phenomenon simulation, but carried out the artistic creation of the character.
    Zhu Duanjun, the director of "A Spark of Fire", grasped the theme thought firmly without letting go, and deliberately rendered all the places that pointed to the "theme". He has already handled the reunion of mother and daughter and the death of Xiao Zhenzi in such a moving way, but he did not let these scenes overshadow the momentum of the workers' strike behind, because the latter is the core idea. He can organize the emotional exchanges with the main and secondary roles among the actors on the stage, and also depict the situations stipulated in the script in a more intense way. And all of this is to guide the ups and downs of emotions to serve the theme thought.
    The Shanghai People's Shanghai Opera Troupe has made great achievements in performing modern plays in the past ten years. This time, the "A Spark of Fire" and another excellent play about rural school teachers, "Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky," which they performed in Beijing, are both products of the collective creation in the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1960. They have insisted on the mass line in artistic work, which has enabled them to produce a large number of better plays quickly, abundantly, well, and economically. We congratulate them on their success. (Attached picture)

### “星星之火”激动人心

    “星星之火”激动人心
    刘厚生
    沪剧“星星之火”在舞台上造成了浓厚的二十年代的气氛，引领观众进入上海“五卅”工人运动前夕的斗争情境之中。以戏曲形式反映革命斗争史，这个戏获得较高的成就。
    作者们创造了从一个普通农妇发展成为先进工人杨桂英的戏剧形象。她死了丈夫，带着儿子到上海来找做包身工的女儿，由于得到工人中地下党员的帮助，她也进厂做了工。但女儿却在一见之后，被日本工头活活踢死；在党的地下组织领导下，长久受着残酷迫害的工人们像火山似地爆发了罢工。在斗争中，杨桂英受到党的领导者刘英等人的教育和帮助，经受了严格的考验；在被日本资本家绑架并且胁迫她出卖罢工时，她面对着支票和匕首，坚决地站起来揭露了吸血鬼们的阴谋。她在抗议顾正红被枪杀的怒潮中，一起走上了街头，举行了震惊世界的“五卅”大示威。——作者们在杨桂英身上倾注了满腔的悲愤和高度的阶级同情，通过她的经历，广阔地反映了二十年代中在帝国主义经济侵略下中国农村的破产和城市的贫困，反映了中国工人阶级与破产农民的血缘关系，突出地反映了工人阶级在它的先锋队率领下与帝国主义殊死斗争的英雄气概。大革命前夕那种“山雨欲来风满楼”的时代风貌，早期工人运动的星星之火必然燎原的革命真理，真实地形象地再现在舞台上。重大的题材，深刻的主题，饱满的人物形象和富于戏剧性的结构安排，使得这个戏具有了较强的艺术感染力和较深的思想教育作用。对于今天的观众，特别是青年观众，可以很好地帮助他们了解前辈们是在怎样艰辛的景况中战斗过来的。
    “星星之火”在表现杨桂英的遭遇、描绘工人的斗争时，没有简单化地只把事件过程排列出来，也不止于只运用戏剧化的对比、重复、强调等手法去激动观众一时的情感。作者们把很大的力量用来挖掘和刻划杨桂英在从农民到革命工人的发展过程中的感情起伏和思想变化。第一场杨桂英见到了骨瘦如柴的小珍子，她知道自己把女儿包身给工头是上了大当，她满腹悲痛，但她不敢不承认包身契的威力，觉得“白纸黑字落人手，生死不由我主张”，她只能与女儿隔墙哀泣。但是当她进厂做了两个月的工人时，她就敢于打调戏她的工头一记耳光了。在小珍子惨死之后，工人们与日本大班正面冲突起来，大家义愤填膺地高喊“罢工”，杨桂英的刻骨仇恨，也使得她不由得不喊出“我罢工”来。虽然我们看得出，她还只是停留在个人的恩仇上，还缺少真正的阶级觉悟。到了第四场，她准备用行动进行个人复仇，刘英等发现了她，对她加以劝阻，同时告诉她受苦的原因不是命，而是“不合理的社会人吃人，帝国主义和军阀，中国人民的大灾星。”告诉她“工人起来闹革命，为国为民为自身，吃人的社会不毁掉，工人休想能翻身。”告诉她“只要我们把工会组织好，同心协力作斗争，我们工人千千万，为啥要怕他们少数人？”这时，杨桂英在阶级斗争的事实面前和党的思想启示下，开始“有些明白了”，并且在听到顾正红被杀消息，大家愤怒地准备战斗时，就能够坚定地说“刘大哥，我跟你们走！”
    杨桂英发展的高潮是第八、九场，在她被绑架之后。日本资本家和狗腿子要她在记者招待会上宣布女儿不是日本人打死的，以便取消工人罢工的口实。但是杨桂英的个人冤仇在这里已上升为不共戴天的阶级仇恨，细流归入了大海，同时在阶级斗争的风浪中她也学到了更多的斗争本领。她不仅粉碎了敌人的进攻，而且能反过来利用记者招待会，宣布了事实真象：“打死我女儿就是你们东洋人！”向全社会控诉了帝国主义及其走狗的滔天罪恶。一个普通的农妇在革命运动中锻炼成无产阶级的斗争英雄。
    作者们不放松杨桂英思想感情发展的每一个转折点，在这些地方都以足够的篇幅让她尽其可能地宣泄自己的情感。这就使得“星星之火”不仅在自己的艺术风格上显得既有磅礴的气势，又有细致的镂刻，而且更显示了浓郁的抒情色调。母女隔墙的重唱，刘英与杨桂英在苏州河边的对唱，被绑架时的抗争，记者招待会上的控诉等等场面，都是情感充沛，奔腾直泻。劳动人民的思想感情，表达得越深越真，就越能打动人心。“星星之火”基本上做到了这一点。而这一点又正是我们民族戏曲传统中最重要的东西。
    舞台演出更加美好地丰富了剧本。一向擅长演少女角色的筱爱琴在这里感人地创造了杨桂英的形象。她的表演朴实无华，准确地掌握了杨桂英性格发展的步骤，层次十分清楚但又不显雕琢痕迹。然而她表演上的成就的最主要之点，还是在处理角色上那种鲜明强烈的倾向性和真挚饱满的情感力量。她的大段唱词，她在激动的每一时刻，深厚的阶级感情都是从肺腑中自然流出，没有做作地挤压感情或空洞地追求形式。筱爱琴的表演中的一些杂质越来越少了，逐渐具有自己的表演风格，这是很令人高兴的。
    邵滨孙饰演的刘英和解洪元饰演的日本人川村也是较好的。从他们（还有其他演员）身上，我们已经几乎看不见过去从半殖民地社会中的沪剧舞台上所带来的那种庸俗的市民气息。刘英是正面的英雄人物，如果有一点庸俗的东西就会损害人物形象，邵滨孙在这方面抓得很牢紧；而川村是反面的日本人，更容易流于庸俗，解洪元并没有走浮浅的现象模拟的路，而是进行了人物的艺术创造。
    “星星之火”的导演朱端钧一步也不放松地抓紧了主题思想，凡是点“题”的地方就加意渲染。他把母女相会和小珍子的死已经处理得是那样地激动人心，但他没有让这些场面盖过后面工人罢工的气势，因为后面更是中心思想的所在。他能够在满台的演员中组织出有主有从的感情交流，而且把剧本上所规定的情境加以更浓的描绘。而这又都是为的把感情的起伏引导去为主题思想服务。
    上海人民沪剧团十年来在演出现代戏方面有着不小的成就。这次他们在北京演出的“星星之火”和另一个写民校教师的优秀剧目“鸡毛飞上天”，都是1958年和1960年大跃进中集体创作的产物。他们坚持了在艺术工作中的群众路线，就使自己又多又快又好又省地出现了成批的较好剧目。我们祝贺他们的成功。（附图片）
