(Dispatch from our newspaper in Hohhot on April 24th) Inner Mongolia is now in the midst of a spring sowing campaign. Everywhere, people and horses are rejoicing, striving to achieve a bumper harvest of various crops this year.

After overfulfilling the spring wheat sowing task, farmers of all nationalities in Inner Mongolia immediately threw themselves into the sowing of cash crops and field crops. More than 30,000 cadres at all levels throughout the region went to the front line of spring cultivation and sowing. Secretaries shook seed drills, and commune leaders guided ploughs, visible everywhere. Millions of commune members, steering more than 190,000 sowing implements, are battling on more than 70 million mu of cultivated land, advancing at a speed of nearly one million mu sown per day.

This year, Inner Mongolia's spring cultivation and sowing work was grasped early and well. By April 19, the region had sown more than 9.2 million mu of spring wheat, more than 800,000 mu more than last year's spring wheat sowing area. Because the entire spring wheat sowing period was advanced by half a month to twenty days compared to previous years, it has powerfully promoted the timely sowing of other crops in terms of quality and quantity. Currently, the sown area in the region has reached more than 19.08 million mu, completing 24.5% of the sowing plan, an increase of about one-third compared to the same period last year.

Thanks to the efforts of farmers of all nationalities last winter and this spring, basically good soil moisture conditions, sufficient manure fertilizer, and land leveling have been achieved in various places during spring sowing. This year, the region's more than 70 million mu of cultivated land has an average of more than 5,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, and 80% of the fertilizer has now been delivered to the fields. Autumn-ploughed land and spring-ploughed land, accounting for one-half of the region's cultivated land area, have been leveled and harrowed more than once, and more than 13.32 million mu of cultivated land has been irrigated. Scientific cultivation methods, advanced production tools, and superior seeds are widely used in sowing throughout the region. In the three leagues of Bayannur, Jirem, and Hulunbuir, 90% of the wheat is sown with seed drills; in Ulanqab League's more than 4 million mu of wheat, most is densely planted with improved drills and fertilizer.

Currently, the early-sown wheat has already emerged. According to a typical survey by the Autonomous Region's agricultural department, the wheat seedlings are complete, robust, and have well-developed root systems, which is rare in previous years.

(Dispatch from our newspaper in Urumqi on April 24th) The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is launching a movement of the whole Party and the whole people to support the people's communes in doing a good job in spring cultivation and sowing, ensuring the sown area (the region's spring sowing area this year is expanded by more than one-quarter compared to last year), ensuring the quality of sowing, and laying a solid foundation for seizing a great agricultural harvest in 1960. At present, spring cultivation and sowing in various parts of Tianshan North and South has entered a high tide, and people's communes have concentrated more than 90% of their labor force on spring sowing. More than 130,000 cadres from various departments of the Autonomous Region and various special districts and counties have rushed to the front line of spring production to participate in production, lead production, and manage canteens together with commune members. In accordance with the instructions of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, they have grasped three key links to promote spring cultivation: grasping firmly, determined to complete the sowing area and strive for more planting and more harvest; grasping quickly, rationally organizing the labor force, making an all-out effort to rush, not missing the farming season; grasping inspection, establishing a layer-by-layer acceptance system to ensure the complete victory of spring cultivation and sowing. Turpan County not only completed its spring sowing task ten days earlier than last year but also expanded the area of grain crops by 100,000 mu. More than 90% of the cadres in Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture have gone down to the countryside, combined with the current spring cultivation production, and assisted various communes in carrying out the mass movement of "Million Mu High-Yield Plots" throughout the prefecture. Cadres at all levels, together with commune members, have established high-yield plots, implementing fixed leadership and fixed targets for each plot, ensuring the progress and quality of spring sowing.

The region's industrial departments have placed the production of urgently needed agricultural machinery and accessories and repair work as the overriding central task at present, organizing all factories and mines with mechanical repair capabilities in the region to link up with people's communes in various places, using technical forces to support spring sowing. An 80-plus factory and mine spring tillage repair team of 500 skilled workers in Urumqi, led by the factory Party secretary and factory director, carrying tools, raw materials, and spare parts, respectively penetrated into the 54 people's communes along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, contracted all the repair and assembly tasks of the commune's tractors and various new farm implements, making sure people followed agricultural implements, repaired malfunctions whenever they occurred, not allowing a single tractor to stop operating, not allowing a single agricultural implement to stop using. They helped communes train tractor drivers, agricultural implement operators, and machine repair workers, and launched a spring sowing tool innovation movement, greatly accelerating the progress of spring sowing.

Recently, on the thousands of miles of highway lines north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, trucks transporting farm implements, pesticides, and fertilizers to the countryside have been traveling day and night. The financial and trade departments have recently rushed more than 5,000 double-wheeled double-share plows and more than 1,000 walk-behind plows and a large number of seed drills to people's communes in various places to support spring cultivation and sowing. Financial and trade departments at all levels and people's communes in various places have generally linked up, formulated specific support plans, and ensured that whatever is needed during the spring cultivation period is supplied. The Autonomous Region's health departments at all levels have recently organized more than 20,000 medical and health workers to go to the production teams of the region's 451 people's communes to carry out canteen, nursery, and mass health care activities.

    内蒙古到处人马欢腾突击春播  新疆全民支援公社保证多种快种
    本报呼和浩特24日电　内蒙古正在突击春播，到处人马欢腾，力争实现今年各种农作物的大丰收。
    内蒙古各族农民在超额完成春小麦播种任务以后，立即投入经济作物和大田作物的播种。全区三万多名各级干部走上春耕播种第一线，书记摇耧，社长扶犁，到处可见；百万社员驾驭着十九万多台播种工具，战斗在七千多万亩耕地上，正以日播近百万亩的速度向前挺进。
    今年，内蒙古的春耕播种工作抓得又早又好。到4月19日，全区已经播种春小麦九百二十万多亩，比去年春小麦播种面积多八十多万亩。由于整个春小麦播种期比往年提前半个月到二十天，有力地促进了其他作物的按质、按量适时下种。现在，全区播种面积已达一千九百零八万多亩，完成了播种计划的24.5％，比去年同时期增加了三分之一左右。
    由于去冬今春各族农民的努力，各地春播时，基本上实现了墒情好，粪肥足和土地平整。今年，全区七千多万亩耕地平均每亩有肥料五千多斤，现在80％的肥料已送到地里。占全区耕地面积二分之一的秋翻地和春翻地，都已平整耙耱一遍以上，有一千三百三十二万多亩耕地经过了灌溉。各地在播种中普遍采用了科学耕作方法、先进的生产工具和优良籽种。巴彦淖尔、哲里木和呼伦贝尔等三个盟的小麦，90％用播种机播种；乌兰察布盟的四百多万亩小麦，大部分用改良耧带粪密植。
    目前，早种的小麦已经出苗，据自治区农业部门的典型调查，小麦出苗齐全、茁壮、根系发达，为往年所罕见。
    本报乌鲁木齐24日电　新疆维吾尔自治区正在展开一个全党全民支援人民公社搞好春耕春播的运动，确保播种面积（全区今年春播面积比去年扩大四分之一以上），确保播种质量，为夺取1960年农业大丰收打下坚实基础。目前，天山南北各地春耕播种已进入高潮，各人民公社都集中90％以上的劳力突击春播。自治区各部门和各专区、县的十三万多名干部都赶到了春耕生产第一线，和公社社员一道参加生产，领导生产，办好食堂。他们依照自治区党委的指示，抓住三个环节促进春耕。即：抓得狠，决心完成播种面积，争取多种多收；抓得快，合理组织劳力，全力突击，不误农时；抓检查，建立层层验收制度，保证春耕春播全胜。吐鲁番县不仅比去年提前十天完成春播任务，还扩大了十万亩粮食作物面积。昌吉回族自治州90％以上的干部都下到农村，结合当前春耕生产，协助各公社在全州范围内开展了“百万亩丰产方”的群众运动。各级干部同社员一起建立了丰产方，实行方方定领导、定指标，保证了春播进度和春播质量。
    全自治区各工业部门已把生产急需的农机具配件和检修工作列为当前压倒一切的中心任务，组织全区所有有机修能力的厂矿和各地人民公社挂上钩，以技术力量支援春播。乌鲁木齐市八十多个厂矿组织的一个由五百名技术工人组成的春耕机修队，在各厂矿的党委书记、厂长的率领下，携带着工具、原材料和零件分别深入兰新铁路沿线的五十四个人民公社里，把公社的拖拉机、各种新式农具的修配任务全部包了下来，作到人跟农具走，随时发生故障随时修好，不让一台拖拉机停驶，不让一件农具停放。他们帮助公社训练拖拉机手、农具手和机器修理工人，开展春播工具革新运动，大大加快了春播进度。
    最近以来，在天山南北的数千里公路线上，向农村赶运农具、农药、化肥的汽车昼夜不停地行驶。财贸部门最近已把五千多部双轮双铧犁和一千多部步犁和大批播种机赶运到各地人民公社，支援春耕春播。各级财贸部门和各地人民公社普遍挂钩，订出具体支援计划，作到春耕期间需要什么就供应什么。自治区各级卫生部门最近已组织二万多名医疗保健人员，到全区四百五十一个人民公社的生产队里，开展食堂、托儿所和群众性的卫生保健活动。
