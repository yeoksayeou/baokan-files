"Nail Gun" is Indeed a Real Thing

Reader's Letter One

    We jumped for joy when we saw the Shandong Quick Talk, "Nail Gun." In our construction projects, we need to hammer in tens of thousands of nails every day, all relying on heavy hand hammers. We are also vigorously engaged in the technical innovation movement, but there have been no results in this particular labor. If there really is such a "nail gun" with high efficiency and low labor intensity, that would be great! Please tell us, is the creation of the "nail gun" actually true? We want to learn from it and manufacture it.

Reader's Letter Two

    After reading the Shandong Quick Talk, "Nail Gun," I couldn't sleep all night. I was so excited! My partners and I couldn't help but pick up the newspaper again and again to read it, reading it over and over without letting it go.

    We thought: Since the construction department can invent and create when nailing, then we can even create and invent when nailing shoes. Our shoe factory, like all units across the country, is vigorously engaged in the technical revolution, determined to reform 85% of the manual operations in the factory into mechanized and semi-mechanized labor before the "May Day" holiday. Nailing is an important process in making shoes, and we have been racking our brains for a long time, but it is still being done manually. Please tell us the structure of the "nail gun" in the construction department, so that we can study and apply it to shoemaking labor.
    Jia Yuming, Worker of Qingdao Taidong District Shoe Factory

Reader's Letter Three

    Our factory's wooden mold workshop is, along with the entire factory, carrying out a vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The wooden mold industry has been operating manually for thousands of years, and we are determined to change this backward state. Now we have created many indigenous machine tools, revolutionizing some of the old tools such as planes, chisels, and saws. We are also using wind power (i.e., cold pumps) to manufacture new hammers, to revolutionize the old hammers, but we have not yet succeeded. Seeing the Shandong Quick Talk "Nail Gun" published in your newspaper, we felt greatly inspired. We feel that replacing ordinary hammers with "nail guns" is not only a new creation in construction history, but also of great value to our wooden mold industry. We want to understand its creation process in order to study and imitate it.

The Author's Reply

    The Shandong Quick Talk "Nail Gun" is a literary work, and the plot and characters are fictional; but the creation of the "nail gun" is indeed a real thing. It was created by the carpentry team of the Second Construction Site of the First Company of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry. This carpentry team often undertakes the task of nailing lath strips for ceilings and nailing upwards. After the workers nailed upwards all day, they were not only exhausted, but their necks were especially sore from twisting. Therefore, the carpentry team made a decision in the current technical revolution movement: first, to overcome the heavy physical labor of "nailing with a hand hammer." The team leader, Zhang Shaoxian, and four veteran masters, Wang Jinrong, Li Ruiming, Fu Jishi, formed a technical research group and boldly designed according to the principle of a gun. After working hard for four days, they finally successfully trial-produced a "nail gun."

    The "nail gun" is called "gun-type nailing machine" in their unit. The structure is not complicated, consisting of six parts: gunstock, firing pin, barrel, striker, nail slot, and controller. Now they have made two types of guns, long and short, suitable for nailing ceiling lath strips and templates with one-inch iron nails, especially suitable for operations in narrow places and operations facing upwards. The "gun-type nailing machine" works very quickly, improving efficiency three times compared to manual work, and the quality is good, the construction is safe, and the greater benefit is that it reduces heavy physical labor.

Editor's Note

    Since our newspaper published the Shandong Quick Talk "Nail Gun" on page 8 on March 17th, up to March 27th, in just ten days, more than forty units and individuals have written letters, made phone calls and telegrams to the editorial department, and even sent people from thousands of miles away. They are all departments and workers related to the "nailing" labor. The areas cover more than a dozen provinces and cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Heilongjiang, and Guangxi. They all unanimously and urgently demanded to know whether the creation of the "nail gun" was indeed a real thing, how it was constructed, and how to use it; they all enthusiastically and excitedly said that it has great inspiration and help for them.

    Such a wide, numerous, and enthusiastic response was unexpected to us!

    From these reactions, we once again excitedly felt how great the momentum and impact of the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement is! Like ocean waves, surging, roaring. It has not only swept across the country but also penetrated into every corner of the motherland. Which region, which industry, which person's heart is not splashing with such waves? And at all times, always in mind, even from a short literary work like the Shandong Quick Talk "Nail Gun," people immediately connected it with their own work, unearthed the flowers of technical innovation and technical revolution, and were eager to learn, study, imitate, and recreate. With such a spirit in our proletariat, how can we not conquer nature and conquer everything! We cannot help but praise that our era is an era of creating miracles, and our people are people who create miracles.

    Now the author has replied: The "nail gun" as a Shandong Quick Talk is fictional, but the creation of the "nail gun" is indeed a real thing. How great! It fully conforms to our heartfelt wishes. I believe that relevant departments and comrades, through hard study, research, imitation, and recreation, will certainly be able to bloom more beautiful flowers and bear more beautiful fruits in the technical innovation and technical revolution.

    “钉子枪”确有其事
    读者来信一
    看到山东快书“钉子枪”，我们高兴得跳了起来。在我们的建筑工程中，一天要钉上几万颗钉子，全靠笨重的手锤去锤。我们也正在大搞技术革新运动，但在这一项劳动上还没有开花结果。要是真有这种效率高、劳动强度低的“钉子枪”，该有多好呀！请告诉我们，“钉子枪”的创造是否确有其事？我们要学习它、制造它。

    读者来信二
    读了山东快书“钉子枪”，我一夜都没睡着。太兴奋了！我和伙伴们禁不住再三拿起报纸来读它，连读了好几遍也没舍得放下。
    我们想：既然建筑部门钉钉子能够发明创造，那我们做鞋钉钉子更可以创造发明了。我们鞋厂和全国各地各单位一样，正在大搞技术革命，坚决要在“五一”节以前，把全厂85％的手工操作改革成机械化和半机械化的劳动。钉钉子是做鞋的一道重要工序，我们已经动了很久脑筋了，但是目前还在手工操作中。请把建筑部门“钉子枪”的构造告诉我们，以便我们研究移用到做鞋的劳动上来。

    读者来信三
    我们工厂的木模车间正和全厂一起，轰轰烈烈地开展着技术革新和技术革命运动。木模行业千百年来一直是手工操作，我们决心要改变这种落后状态。现在我们已经造出了许多土机床，革掉了部分刨、凿、锯等旧工具的命。我们还在利用风力（即冷泵）来制造新鎯头，去革掉旧鎯头的命，但是还没有成功。看到你们报上登的山东快书“钉子枪”，我们感到启发很大。我们觉得用“钉子枪”代替普通鎯头，不但是建筑史上的新创造，对我们木模行业也大有价值。我们想了解它的创造经过，以便研究仿造。

    作者的回信
    山东快书“钉子枪”是一篇文艺作品，情节和人物都是虚构的；但“钉子枪”的创造却是确有其事。它是石油工业部第一工程局第一公司二工地木工队创制的。这个木工队常常承担钉天棚的灰条子和仰面钉钉子的活计。工人们仰面钉了一天钉子，浑身疲累不说，脖子尤其扭得酸疼。木工队于是就在当前技术革命运动中作出一项决定：首先攻下“用手锤钉钉子”这道笨重的体力劳动关。队长张绍先与队员王金荣、李瑞明、傅继诗等四位老师傅，成立了一个技术研究小组，按枪的原理来大胆设计。苦钻苦研了四天，终于试制成功了一把“钉子枪”。
    “钉子枪”在他们单位叫做“枪式钉钉机”，构造并不复杂，一共分枪托、枪机、枪筒、撞针、钉子槽和控制器等六个部分。现在他们已经制作出长、短枪两种，适于用一寸铁钉钉天棚灰条和模板，特别适用于狭窄地方的操作和仰面操作。“枪式钉钉机”工作速度很快，比手工提高效率三倍，而且质量好，施工安全，更大的好处是减轻了笨重的体力劳动。

    编后小语
    3月17日本报第八版刊登了山东快书“钉子枪”以后，到3月27日止，仅仅十天时间，就有四十来个单位和个人给编辑部写来信、打来电话和电报，甚至不远千里派了人来。他们都是和“钉钉子”这项劳动有关的部门和工人，地区遍及北京、上海、黑龙江、广西等十几个省市区。他们不约而同，都迫切要求知道“钉子枪”的创造是否确有其事，怎样构造、怎样使用；都热情兴奋地说它对他们有很大启示和帮助。
    这么广泛众多而又热烈一致的反应，是我们所意想不到的！
    我们从这些反应里又一次兴奋地感觉到了当前技术革新和技术革命运动的声势和冲击力量有多么大！犹如海洋里的浪潮，奔腾澎湃，汹涌咆哮。它不仅已经席卷全国，而且深入到了祖国每一个角落。哪一个地区，哪一个行业，哪一个人的心坎里，不在迸溅着这种浪花？而且时时刻刻，念念不忘，哪怕是从一段山东快书“钉子枪”这么一个短篇文艺作品里，人们也立刻从中联系到了自己的工作，发掘出了技术革新和技术革命之花，急着要学习，要钻研，要仿造，要再创造。我们无产阶级有着这样的风气，这样的精神，怎么不能征服自然，征服一切！我们不能不赞美，我们的时代，是创造奇迹的时代，我们的人，是创造奇迹的人。
    现在作者作了答复：“钉子枪”作为山东快书是虚构的，“钉子枪”的创造却是确有其事。多么好啊！完全符合我们大家的衷心愿望。相信有关部门有关同志经过努力学习、研究、仿造、再创造，就一定能够在技术革新和技术革命中开出更多鲜艳的花朵，结出更多美丽的果实。
