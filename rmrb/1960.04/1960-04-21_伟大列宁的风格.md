    The Style of the Great Lenin
    Lin Ling
    Lenin, in his article "The Military Program of the Proletarian Revolution," said this: During the Paris Commune, women and children over the age of thirteen fought alongside men. A bourgeois observer who witnessed this scene wrote in a British newspaper in May 1871: "What a terrible nation the French would be if they were all women!" In response to this, Lenin said, "It cannot be otherwise in the future battles to overthrow the bourgeoisie. The proletarian women will never passively watch the well-armed bourgeoisie shooting down workers who are poorly armed or unarmed." And he predicted that these nations that are currently frightened "will sooner or later and absolutely develop into an international alliance of 'terrible nations' of the revolutionary proletariat."
    The proletariat knows that striving for its own liberation is also striving for the liberation of all mankind, that this is the final battle, and that they are determined to contribute their strength and even their lives without any hesitation. Lenin believed that truly revolutionary women of the oppressed class would say to their sons: "You will soon grow up, and people will give you a gun. You must take up the gun and learn military science well. The proletariat needs this science, not to fight against their own brothers, to fight against the workers of other countries… but to oppose the bourgeoisie of their own country, in order to eliminate exploitation, poverty, and war not by good intentions, but by defeating the bourgeoisie and disarming them." (All the above are from "Lenin's Collected Works," Vol. 23, p. 79)
    Having only good intentions for socialism, no matter how beautifully it is expressed, is not only empty talk but also a betrayal of the sacred cause of the proletariat if concrete actions are not taken and if one's life is not risked to realize it. It is with this fighting spirit that Lenin educated generations of our revolutionaries.
    Lenin advocated peace and fought for peace throughout his life. He said: "Socialism opposes the use of force against nations. This is an indisputable fact. Socialism also generally opposes the use of force against people. However... no one would conclude from this that socialism opposes revolutionary violence." (Collected Works, Vol. 28, p. 266) In order to truly achieve a peaceful society without violence, socialists must first use revolutionary violence to eliminate the imperialist bourgeoisie that creates exploitation, poverty, and war.
    To strive for the liberation of the proletariat and achieve true peace, Lenin believed that it was necessary to adopt a fighting approach. And Lenin's life was precisely the fighting life of a great revolutionary.
    Lenin lived in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. He analyzed the social situation and the international situation at that time, created the fighting doctrine of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, and led the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat and all working people in Russia and other countries around the world. He was the fighting leader of the working people of the world.
    Lenin appeared as a revolutionary fighter at the age of seventeen, actively participating in the struggle against the Tsar. After Lenin accepted Marxism, he first engaged in ideological battles with the non-Marxist populists, economists, and others in Russia. After the establishment of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, he fought against the Mensheviks, and he launched fierce struggles against the opportunism and revisionism of the Second International on an international scale. After countless ideological clashes and battles of charging into the line, Lenin defeated all enemies, defended Marxism, and developed Marxism, achieving the victory of the Russian Revolution and paving the way for the proletarian revolution in countries around the world.
    All of Lenin's works are permeated with a magnificent fighting spirit. Lenin's articles are veritable ideological weapons. He used these sharp weapons to defeat all kinds of enemies and also used these weapons to arm the laborers of Russia and the world to fight against their oppressors and exploiters.
    Lenin was a fervent orator. His speeches were concise, full of fighting spirit, and highly persuasive and inspiring.
    Lenin was a great dialectical materialist. Dialectical materialism itself is a combative ideological system. Lenin had an article on materialism entitled "On the Significance of Militant Materialism." From thought to action, Lenin was a consistent, vigorous, and fully combative proletarian revolutionary fighter, the creator of invincible Leninism, and the great leader of the proletarian revolution in the world. Combativeness is Lenin's style, it is Lenin's spirit. As we commemorate Lenin's ninetieth birthday, what we must learn from Lenin is this style and this spirit.

    伟大列宁的风格
    林陵
    列宁在“无产阶级革命的军事纲领”一文里讲了这样一段话：在巴黎公社时期，妇女和十三岁以上的儿童同男子并肩作战。有一位看到过这种情形的资产者，1871年5月在一家英国报纸上写道：“如果法兰西民族都是妇女，那是一个多么可怕的民族呵！”列宁针对这一点，说“在未来的推翻资产阶级的战斗中，也不可能不是这样。无产阶级的妇女决不会消极地眼看武装精良的资产阶级在枪杀武装很坏或手无寸铁的工人”。并且预言说，目前这些被吓倒了的民族，“早晚一定会而且绝对会发展成革命无产阶级的‘可怕民族’的国际同盟”。
    无产阶级知道，争取自己的解放，也就是争取全人类的解放，这是最后一战，他们和她们是决不怜惜贡献出自己的力量甚至生命的。列宁认为，真正革命的被压迫阶级的妇女，会对自己的儿子说：“你快长大了，人家会给你枪。你要拿起枪来，好好地学军事。无产者需要这门科学，这并不是为了去打自己的兄弟，去打别国的工人……而是为了反对本国的资产阶级，为了不是靠善良的愿望，而是用战胜资产阶级和解除它的武装的办法来消灭剥削、贫困和战争。”（以上均见“列宁全集”23卷79页）
    对于社会主义仅仅有善良的愿望，无论把它说得怎样美丽动听，如果不采取具体行动，不惜自己的生命使它实现，不只是空谈，而且是叛变无产阶级的神圣事业。列宁就是用这种战斗的精神教育我们几代革命者的。
    列宁是主张和平的，并且一生是为和平而斗争的。他说：“社会主义反对对民族使用暴力。这是无可争辩的事实。社会主义也一般地反对对人使用暴力。然而……谁也不会由此得出结论说，社会主义反对革命暴力”。（全集28卷266页）社会主义者为了真正实现没有暴力的和平社会，首先要用革命的暴力消灭制造剥削、贫困和战争的帝国主义资产阶级。
    为了争取无产阶级的解放，实现真正的和平，列宁认为非采取战斗的办法不可。而列宁的一生也正是伟大革命家战斗的一生。
    列宁生活在帝国主义和无产阶级革命的时代，他分析了当时的社会情况和国际形势，创造了帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的战斗学说，并且领导了俄国和世界各国无产阶级以及一切劳动人民的革命斗争，他是全世界劳动人民的战斗的领袖。
    列宁在十七岁时就以革命战士的姿态出现，积极参加反对沙皇的斗争。列宁在接受了马克思主义之后，首先和俄国非马克思主义的民粹派、经济派等进行思想上的战斗，俄国社会民主工党成立后和孟什维克进行斗争，并且在国际范围内和第二国际的机会主义、修正主义展开激烈的斗争。在无数次思想交锋和冲锋陷阵的战斗之后，列宁战胜了一切敌人，保卫了马克思主义和发展了马克思主义，取得了俄国革命的胜利，为世界各国无产阶级革命开辟了道路。
    列宁的全部著作，渗透着气势磅礴的战斗精神。列宁的文章是名副其实的思想武器，他运用这种锐利的武器，战胜了各色各样的敌人，并且也用这种武器武装了俄国的和全世界的劳动者，用来对自己的压迫者和剥削者进行斗争。
    列宁是一个火热的演说家，他的演说言简意赅，充满战斗精神，说服力和鼓动性很强。
    列宁是伟大的辩证唯物主义者，辩证唯物主义本身就是一个战斗性的思想体系，列宁有一篇论述唯物主义的文章，题目就叫“战斗唯物主义的意义”。列宁从思想到行动，是一个始终如一的、生气勃勃的、战斗性饱满的无产阶级革命的战士，是战无不胜的列宁主义的创造者，是全世界无产阶级革命的伟大领袖。战斗性就是列宁的风格，就是列宁的精神，我们纪念列宁九十诞辰，要向列宁学习的，就是他的这种风格，这种精神。
