Chairman, fellow delegates:

I warmly endorse the reports of Deputy Premier Li Fuchun, Deputy Premier Li Xiannian, and Deputy Premier Tan Zhenlin, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, China's socialist construction is experiencing sustained leaps forward. The movement for technological innovation and technical revolution has entered a new stage. In these great days, where one day equals twenty years, with the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, medical and health work has also seen unprecedented leaps forward. I would now like to report to the congress on the work of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in Shandong Province over the past year.

Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, and with the active support of the broad masses, our province's TCM work, after the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, has achieved great development and improvement. In particular, through the implementation of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the right-leaning opportunist ideology has been thoroughly crushed, the Party's TCM policies have been further implemented, and some phenomena of underestimation, discrimination, and exclusion of TCM have been eliminated. This has greatly enhanced the communist consciousness and work enthusiasm of TCM practitioners, and a mass movement of collecting folk remedies and visiting experienced practitioners has been launched. A high tide of Western medicine practitioners learning TCM has been initiated, and the unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine have been greatly strengthened. As a result, TCM work, like other work, has also ushered in a new situation of unprecedented leaps forward.

In accordance with the central government's policy that medical and health work should serve politics and production, nine new TCM hospitals have been built in the province, adding more than 400 beds. TCM departments (sections) have been established in general hospitals, medical colleges, and specialized hospitals at all levels. TCM courses have been added to all higher and secondary medical colleges. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,000 TCM practitioners have been employed in public medical institutions throughout the province, and other TCM practitioners have also participated in joint organizations or commune hospitals.

TCM education has also advanced by leaps and bounds, with thirteen new TCM schools established, enrolling a total of more than 700 students. TCM refresher schools have been established in all special districts, cities, and counties with suitable conditions. To inherit the academic experience of veteran TCM practitioners, more than 6,400 TCM apprentices have been trained throughout the province. TCM research work has also developed from scratch and from small to large scale. In the past year, one provincial research institute, thirteen special district, city, and county research institutes, and more than 630 commune research offices (groups) have been established.

To improve TCM refresher courses and popularize acupuncture, more than 600 TCM teacher trainers and 4,200 acupuncture teacher trainers have been trained, and 47,000 acupuncture practitioners have been trained for the communes. At present, eleven counties in the province have basically achieved the requirement that every village and team have acupuncture practitioners, so that minor illnesses can be treated in the village and major illnesses can be treated in the county.

In the work of Western medicine practitioners learning TCM, the central government's instructions have been earnestly implemented, and TCM training classes for Western medicine practitioners have been established, with more than 130 trainees. Some of these trainees have many years of clinical experience. Most of them are senior resident physicians, some attending physicians, and some chief physicians. In the Great Leap Forward, they compiled the "Clinical Work Handbook" and "Intermediate TCM Textbook" and wrote many scientific papers. A total of 130 TCM training classes for on-the-job Western medicine practitioners have been established, with the participation of more than 2,900 people. After a year of study, most of them have mastered simple acupuncture techniques, and many Western medicine practitioners have a preliminary grasp of systematic TCM theoretical knowledge and some effective treatment methods, creating favorable conditions for researching and organizing traditional Chinese medicine.

Due to the strengthening of unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine, many diseases that were previously considered difficult to treat or for which there were no good treatment methods are now being treated jointly by TCM and Western medicine with significant results. These include: aplastic anemia, infectious hepatitis, labyrinthine hydrops, cerebral hemorrhage, thromboangiitis obliterans, brucellosis, chronic nephritis, dropsy, hookworm disease, etc. Not only are there new methods of treatment, but there is also the possibility of complete cure.

In the movement to collect folk remedies and visit experienced practitioners, more than 10,000 effective prescriptions, secret prescriptions, and single-herb prescriptions have been collected (incomplete statistics). These family heirlooms passed down through generations have very high efficacy.

Great achievements have also been made in the work of organizing and researching traditional Chinese medicine. For example, "Orthopedics," "Simple Acupuncture," "Abstract and Annotations of the Inner Classic," "Popular Acupuncture Handbook," "Commentary on Treatise on Febrile Diseases," "Shandong Traditional Chinese Medicine," "Shandong Materia Medica," "Collection of Shandong Effective Prescriptions," "Medical Prescriptions of People's Communes," and more than ten other works, including basic theoretical textbooks for Western medicine practitioners learning traditional Chinese medicine, have been published. Annotations of the Difficult Classic and the Spiritual Pivot have been completed and will soon be available to readers. In clinical work, the treatment experience of difficult diseases such as filariasis, hypertension, neurasthenia, chronic nephritis, brucellosis, uterine prolapse, liver disease, and edema has been systematically summarized.

In the movement for technological innovation and technical revolution, great achievements have also been made in the adoption of new technologies and cutting-edge technologies. For example, the "Electronic Pulse Diagnosis Instrument" and "Ear Diagnosis Instrument" have been created, which have high value in diagnosis, treatment, and scientific research. In the use of cathode oscilloscopes to explore meridian research, the similarities and differences in the wavelengths of the twelve meridians have been preliminarily discovered. According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine that "meridians travel through the ear," research on the diagnosis of ear-area galvanic current has been carried out. The functional impact of acupuncture treatment of goiter and the mechanism of acupuncture treatment of appendicitis are also being studied and have achieved certain results, providing preliminary scientific clues for further research and organization of traditional Chinese medicine in the future.

In terms of medicinal material production, procurement, and research, the "Instructions of the State Council on the Development of Medicinal Material Production" has been resolutely implemented, and the masses have been fully mobilized to cooperate with agricultural and forestry departments to launch a mass movement of planting medicinal materials in every commune and household, and collecting medicinal materials by everyone. In the past year, the production of medicinal materials has developed rapidly. For example, safflower yields of more than forty catties per mu and fresh rehmannia yields of more than two thousand catties per mu have been achieved. Forty-one medicinal material mountains and twenty-one scorpion mountains have been established throughout the province. More than 300 new medicinal materials that were not discovered in the past have been discovered. The planting area of medicinal materials in the province is 74,000 mu, an increase of 4.7 times compared with 1958. More than 70 kinds of medicinal materials have been introduced from other places, and more than 20 kinds of medicinal materials have been changed from wild to cultivated.

In the research of medicinal materials, we are guided by the principles of improving efficacy and saving medicine. We have researched the introduction, cultivation, dosage form processing, preparation, and technological improvement. In the past year, dozens of Chinese medicines such as Sophora flavescens, Stellera chamaejasme, Corydalis ambigua, and Clematis chinensis have been systematically studied, including the investigation of original plants, the extraction of single herbs, the extraction and separation of chemical components, and pharmacological experiments. Through clinical experiments, the effective components of certain unit drugs have been confirmed, and the scientific basis for efficacy has been sought. A lot of work has been done in this area and certain achievements have been made. At the same time, some substitutes or mixed drugs have been identified. Effective single prescriptions or prepared medicines, such as Health Tonic, Polygonum multiflorum and Mulberry Brain Tonic, Chai Ma Detoxification Drink, and Babao Dan, have been analyzed for efficacy and dosage form improvements.

In short, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, the achievements of TCM work in our province in the past year are very great. This fully proves the correctness, wisdom, and greatness of the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In practical work, I have realized that:

1.  In all work, "of all things, listening to the Party is the most important thing," and we should listen to the Party honestly and at all times. We must adhere to putting politics in command, earnestly implement the Party's TCM policies, and make it clear that medical and health work serves politics and production. Otherwise, we will be divorced from the masses and from politics, and nothing will be accomplished. Where the Party and Chairman Mao point, we will do it. This is the fundamental experience.

2.  TCM education, medical treatment, and research must follow the mass line, and mass movements must be carried out on a large scale. The wisdom and strength of the masses are unlimited. In addition to the written records of traditional Chinese medicine heritage, a considerable part is spread or hidden in the hands of the broad masses of the people. To unearth these treasures, we must carry out a mass movement to collect folk remedies and visit experienced practitioners, and a mass TCM research work, to concentrate the advanced experiences and scattered materials, and gradually systematize them, match them into dragons, and effectively promote them, setting off a socialist revolutionary competition of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping, embodying Chairman Mao's teaching of "walking on two legs." Implementing the policy of unity and cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine, combining indigenous and foreign methods, combining professional institutions and mass movements, combining theory and practice, and combining cutting-edge technology and popularization, and adopting the method of spreading nets in all directions and combining key points, can we quickly tap the great treasure house of the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine. At the same time, scientific research must be carried out with great collaboration. Do not work alone. Only by pooling the wisdom and efforts of the masses can we make greater achievements.

3.  To inherit and carry forward the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, we must strengthen the unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine and use modern scientific methods to research and organize traditional Chinese medicine. This is a glorious and arduous task entrusted to all medical personnel by the Party and the people. We must strive to complete it. In clinical research, we must adopt dual diagnosis, with both TCM diagnosis and Western medicine diagnosis, joint treatment, observation, and learning from each other's strengths to make up for weaknesses, adopting rational and effective parts, and then summarizing them, so that the two sets of Chinese and Western medicine are gradually transformed into a complete new Chinese medicine.

Plans for 1960:

On the basis of what we already have in 1959, with the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, we must establish lofty ambitions, stand firm, strive for the upper reaches, and climb to the peaks, and further vigorously implement the Party's TCM policies, inherit and carry forward the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, and strengthen the unity and cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine. Vigorously carry out the research and organization of the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine. We are determined to overcome diseases such as hypertension, tumors, liver cirrhosis, nephritis, infectious hepatitis, sequelae of infantile paralysis, brucellosis, filariasis, hookworm disease, leprosy, goiter, and uterine prolapse. Further explore meridians and study the mechanism of acupuncture treatment. Continue to do a good job in the organization, testing, and promotion of the collected effective prescriptions, secret prescriptions, and single prescriptions. Further organize and summarize the academic experience of veteran TCM practitioners; in 1960, each special district, city, and county in the province must compile one or two volumes of clinical case studies, with each volume containing at least 150 to 200 papers. Further strengthen the leadership of the TCM training classes for Western medicine practitioners and the TCM training classes for on-the-job, establish and improve systems, and improve teaching quality. Strengthen the work of training apprentices, and increase the number of young apprentices by 2,000 on the existing basis. Universally conduct TCM refresher courses to improve their political and professional level, and plan to complete the refresher courses for all 14,000 TCM practitioners who have not yet received training in 1960. Each special district, city, and county should establish TCM schools and TCM nursing schools in a planned manner. Popularize acupuncture (ear acupuncture, dermal acupuncture, plum blossom needle) and massage throughout the province. Improve TCM refresher work. Further carry out mass folk remedy collection and visits to experienced practitioners. Vigorously carry out the production and procurement of Chinese medicinal materials to meet medical needs. In 1960, the area planted with medicinal materials will be 260,000 mu, an increase of 157% compared with 1959. Some medicinal materials with low yields, such as yam, safflower, Scrophularia ningpoensis, Angelica dahurica, chrysanthemum, Trichosanthes kirilowii, Alisma orientalis, fennel, and white mustard, should achieve self-sufficiency and strive for surplus.

The above is a general overview of the TCM work arrangements in the province in 1960. In addition to striving to complete the provincial plan, I personally plan to:

1.  Strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, improve class consciousness, and transform thinking. Only by improving political level can we overcome backward and conservative ideas. To have a technical revolution, we must first use ideological revolution as the driving force. Only in this way can we emit greater light and heat in our work.

2.  Strive to train apprentices well, and pass on my academic and clinical experience to the younger generation without reservation. I plan to train apprentices to the level of ordinary TCM practitioners in two years, and to pass on all my successful clinical experience to them in four to five years, and ensure that they learn well. In the process of teaching, I will teach TCM knowledge and conduct scientific research at the same time, so that what they learn can be combined with modern medicine as much as possible, so that they can become new-type doctors with two sets of skills in TCM and Western medicine.

3.  In scientific research, in 1960, I will further improve the electronic pulse diagnosis instrument, try to manufacture a sound-based syndrome differentiation instrument, and plan to study diseases that are most harmful to people's health, such as heart disease, liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.), cancer, hypertension, filariasis, chronic nephritis, gynecological diseases (including pelvic inflammatory disease), etc., and strive to find a set of successful treatment methods within this year. Within two to three years, I will cooperate in writing seven books: Detailed Explanation of the Difficult Classic with Research on Ancient Books and Historical Commentary, Pharmacology of TCM Medication by Meridians, Encyclopedia of TCM Clinical Practice, Historical Materials of Chinese Medicine, Experimental Gynecology, Therapeutics of Nervous System Diseases, and Hepatobiliary and Gastrointestinal Diseases.

I am determined to adhere to putting politics in command under the leadership of the Party, carry out technical revolution on a large scale, and cooperate closely with TCM and Western medicine to make greater achievements in order to repay the Party and the people for their care. Please review and correct any inappropriateness above. I wish all delegates good health and continued leaps forward in their work.

专栏：

    山东中医药工作的丰收
    刘惠民代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我热烈拥护李富春副总理、李先念副总理、谭震林副总理的报告和人大常委会的工作报告。
    我国的社会主义建设，在党中央毛主席的正确领导下，我国国民经济在持续跃进中，技术革新与技术革命运动已经进入了一个新的阶段，在这一天等于二十年的伟大日子里，随着工农业生产的飞跃发展，医药卫生工作也出现了空前的跃进。现将山东省一年来中医药工作向大会汇报如下。我省中医药工作，在中央、省委的正确领导下，在广大群众的积极支持下，又经过了全民整风和反右派斗争，获得了很大的发展和提高，特别通过党的八届八中全会决议的贯彻，彻底粉碎了右倾机会主义思潮，进一步贯彻了党的中医政策，消除了某些轻视、歧视、排斥中医的现象，使广大中医药人员的共产主义觉悟和工作积极性大大提高，并深入的开展了群众性的采风访贤运动，相继掀起了一个西医学习中医的高潮，中西医之间的团结合作大大加强，因而中医药工作和其他工作一样也出现了一个空前跃进的新局面。根据中央指出的：医药卫生工作为政治服务，为生产服务的方针，全省新建中医院九处，增加病床四百余张，各级综合医院、医疗院、专科医院都普遍增设了中医部（科），各高、中级医药院校都增加了中医课。据不完全统计，全省被吸收参加公立医疗机构工作的中医药人员就有二千余人，其他中医药人员也都参加联合机构，或公社医院。中医教育事业上也是突飞猛进，新建中医院校十三处，共有学生七百余人，各专、市，及有条件的县，都举办了中医进修学校。为继承老年中医的学术经验，全省中医带徒弟六千四百余人。中医研究工作，也是从无到有，从少到多的发展起来，一年来新建省研究所一处，专、市、县研究所十三处，公社研究室（组）六百三十余处。为作好中医温课和普及针灸工作，共培养中医师资六百余人，针灸师资四千二百余人，为公社培养针灸员四万七千余人，目前全省已有十一个县，基本上达到村村队队有针灸员；小病不出村，大病不出县的要求。在西医学习中医工作上，认真贯彻了中央的指示，开办了西医离职学习中医班，学员一百三十余名，其中有些人员具有多年的临床经验，他们多数是高年住院医师，部分主治医师和主任医师，在大跃进中他们编写了“临床工作手册”、“中医中级教材”，并写了很多科学论文。在职学习中医班共一百三十处，参加人数二千九百余人，经一年的学习，绝大部分都掌握了简易针灸术，许多西医初步掌握了系统的中医理论知识，和某些有效疗法，为研究整理祖国医学创造了有利条件。
    由于中西医之间的团结、合作的加强，许多过去认为难治的病，或无好法治疗的病，现在中西医密切合作，共同治疗，都取得了显著成绩，如：再生障碍性贫血，传染性肝炎迷路积水，脑血管出血，血栓闭塞性脉管炎，布氏杆菌病，慢性肾炎，水肿病，钩虫病等。不仅有新的方法治疗，而且有完全治愈的可能。
    在采风访贤运动中，共收集验方、秘方、单方万余件（不完全统计）。这些世代相传的传家宝，疗效都很高。
    对祖国医学的整理研究工作，也取得了很大的成绩，如出版了“正骨学”、“简易针灸学”、“内经摘要语释”、“通俗针灸手册”、“伤寒论串解”、“山东中医药”、“山东中药学”、“山东验方集锦”、“人民公社医方类编”，及西医学习中医的基本理论教材等十余种著作，对难经和灵枢语释业已脱稿，即将和读者见面。在临床工作上，系统的总结了对血丝虫病，高血压，神经衰弱，慢性肾炎，布氏杆菌病，子宫脱垂，肝脏病，水肿等疑难病症的治疗经验。在技术革新与技术革命运动中，在采用新技术和尖端技术上，同样取得很大成绩，如创制的“电子诊脉仪”、“耳诊仪”，无论在诊断上、治疗上以及科学研究上都有较高的价值。在利用阴极示波器，探讨经络的研究，初步发现了十二经波长的相同点和不同点，又根据祖国医学“经络循耳行”的理论，进行了耳区感电流诊断的研究。针灸治疗甲状腺肿的机能影响，针灸治疗阑尾炎的机制等，都正在研究，并取得了一定的成绩，为今后进一步研究整理祖国医学，提供了初步的科学线索。
    在药材生产、收购和研究工作方面，坚决贯彻了国务院“关于发展中药材生产问题的指示”，充分发动群众，搞好和农、林部门的协作，掀起一个社社种药，户户种药，人人采药的群众性运动。一年来，中药材生产有了迅速的发展，如：春红花亩产四十余斤，鲜生地亩产二千余斤，都得到了丰产，全省建立了药材山四十一处，蝎子山二十一处，发现过去没发现的新药材三百余种，全省药材种植面积七万四千余亩，比1958年增加四点七倍。引种外地药材七十余种，变野生为家种的药材二十余种。在药材的研究上，我们是本着提高疗效，节约用药的原则，从引种、培植、剂型的加工炮制，技术的改进等方面研究，一年来对苦参、狼毒、土元胡、透骨草等几十种中药，系统的进行了研究，其中包括原植物调查，单味药的提炼，化学成分的提取，分离，药理实验等，通过临床实验，肯定了某些单位药的有效成分，寻找疗效的科学根据，在这方面作了很多工作，取得了一定成绩，同时对部分代用药，或混用的药品进行了鉴定。对用之有效的一些单方，或成药，如保健丹，首乌桑椹补脑汁，柴麻解毒饮，八宝丹等成药作了疗效的分析和剂型的改进。
    总之我省的中医工作，一年来在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，成绩是很大的，这完全证明了党中央、毛主席领导的正确，英明，伟大。在实际工作中使我体会到：
    1、在各项工作中“千条，万条，只有听党的话是第一条”，而且应当时时刻刻老老实实听党的话。要坚持政治挂帅，认真贯彻党的中医政策，必须明确，医药卫生工作是为政治服务，为生产服务，否则即脱离群众，脱离政治，那就会一事无成。党和毛主席指向那里，我们就作到那里，这是根本的经验。
    2、中医教育，医疗，研究工作，都必须走群众路线，必须大搞群众运动，群众的智慧和力量是无限的。祖国医学遗产，除有书本记载的之外，还有相当的一部分是流传或蕴藏在民间广大群众手中，要想把这些宝物挖掘出来，就必须开展一个群众性的采风访贤运动，及群众性的中医药研究工作，把点滴的先进经验，和分散的材料，集中起来，逐步把它系统起来，配套成龙，有效的推广，掀起一个学、比、赶、帮的社会主义革命竞赛，体现毛主席教导我们的“两条腿走路”的方针。贯彻中西医团结合作，土洋并举，专业机构和群众运动相结合，理论与实践相结合，尖端技术和普及相结合的方针，采取四面撒网，结合重点的方法，才能迅速挖掘祖国医学遗产这一伟大宝库，同时在科学研究上必须搞大协作，不要单干，只有群策群力才能作出更大的成绩。
    3、继承与发扬祖国医学遗产，必须加强中西医之间的团结合作，用现代科学方法来研究、整理祖国医学，这是党和人民交给我们全体医药人员的光荣而艰巨的任务，我们必须努力完成，在临床研究中采用双重诊断，有中医诊断，也有西医诊断，共同治疗，观察，取长补短，采取合理有效的部分，然后再总结起来，这样逐步的把中西医两套医学变成一套完整的我国新医学。
    1960年的打算：在1959年已有的基础上，以八届八中全会决议的精神，要树雄心，立大志，争上游，攀高峰，进一步大力贯彻党的中医政策，继承发扬祖国医学遗产，加强中西医团结合作。大力开展对祖国医学遗产的研究整理工作。下决心攻破高血压，肿瘤，肝硬变，肾炎，传染性肝炎，小儿麻痹后遗症，布氏杆菌病，血丝虫病，钩虫病，麻风病，甲状腺肿，子宫脱垂等病。进一步探讨经络，研究针灸治疗的机制。继续作好对所搜集的验方、秘方、单方的整理、试验、推广工作。进一步整理总结老年中医的学术经验；1960年全省各专、市、县，都要编写临床验案一至二辑，每辑至少要有一百五十至二百篇论文。进一步加强西医离职学习中医班和在职学习中医班的领导工作，建立健全制度，提高教学质量。加强带徒弟的工作，要在已有的基础上增加青年徒弟二千名。普遍进行中医温课，提高他们的政治、业务水平，计划在1960年内将尚未得到进修的一万四千名中医全部进修完。各专、市、县有计划的建立中医学校，中医护校。在全省范围内普及针灸（耳针、皮针、梅花针）和推拿。改进中医进修工作。进一步开展群众性的采风访贤。大力开展中药材生产收购工作，满足医疗需要，在1960年药材种植面积二十六万亩，比1959年增长157％。有些药材如山药、红花、元参、白芷、菊花、括蒌、泽夕、小茴香、白芥子等产量少的药材，要达到自给自足，争取有余。
    以上是全省1960年中医工作安排的大体情况，我个人除努力完成全省计划外，还计划：
    1、努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作，提高阶级觉悟，改造思想，政治水平提高了，才能克服落后保守思想，要想技术革命，首先必须以思想革命作为动力，只有这样才能在工作中发出更大的光和热。
    2、努力带好徒弟，把自己的学术和临床经验，毫无保留的传授给青年一代，计划在二年内把徒弟培养到一般中医水平，四至五年内把我的成功的临床经验，全部传授给他们，并保证让他们学好，在传授过程中，一面教中医知识，一面进行科学研究，使他们学到的东西，尽量和现代医学结合起来，使他们成为具有中西医两套本领的新型医师。
    3、在科学研究上1960年进一步改进电子诊脉仪、试制听声辨证仪，有计划的研究对人民健康危害最严重的疾病，如心脏病，肝脏病（肝炎肝硬变等），癌症，高血压，丝虫病，慢性肾炎，妇女病（盆腔炎包括在内）等疾病的研究，争取在今年内找出一套成功的治疗方法。在二三年内协作编写难经详解附难经古籍考与史评，中医分经用药药理学，中医临床百科全书，中国医学史料，实验妇科学，神经系统病治疗学，肝胆病和肠胃病学等七部著作。我决心在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，大搞技术革命，和中西医密切合作，做出更大的成绩，以报答党和人民对我们的关怀。以上不妥当之处请各位代表予以审查指正，敬祝各位代表身体健康和工作继续跃进。
