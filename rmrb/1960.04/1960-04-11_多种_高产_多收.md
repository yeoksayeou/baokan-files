Multiple Planting, High Yield, More Harvests
中共安徽广德县委第一书记　Zhang Fang (First Secretary of the CPC Guangde County Committee, Anhui)

In the Kuomintang days, life was truly desolate:
Drought and floods were unstoppable,
The people ate wild vegetable soup;
Exorbitant taxes were like tigers and wolves,
Forcing families to ruin and death.

After liberation, things changed:
Harnessing mountains and rivers ensures good harvests,
Jackals, wolves, tigers, and leopards were swept away;
From then on, life has security,
Abundant food and clothing bring joy.

These two rhymes are a true reflection of the lives of the commune members of the Baidian People's Commune in Guangde County, before and after liberation.

Small collectives are stronger than individual farming, and large collectives are even stronger. In 1958, the people's commune was established, and from its inception, it fully demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of "large scale and public ownership" in grain production. After the Party put forward the policy of "multiple planting, high yield, and more harvests," it further inspired the production enthusiasm of the vast cadres and masses. Relying on the wisdom of the masses, the commune party committee utilized the characteristics of the mountainous area with abundant firewood and grass, burning large amounts of "baozi" fertilizer and earth-ash fertilizer, deep plowing the land, applying large amounts of green manure, increasing the soil temperature, repairing ponds and dams, and sun-warming water for irrigation to increase water temperature, ensuring early sowing of early-maturing crops and abundant harvests of late-maturing crops. They selected and introduced early-maturing, high-yielding, and cold-resistant improved varieties, conquering nature, and greatly increasing the multiple cropping index from 141% in 1958 to 173%, resulting in a rapid increase in grain production. The grain yield per mu in Guangxin Brigade has exceeded 800 jin, and there are 21 mu of double-cropping rice with a yield of 1,029 jin per mu. The historically grain-deficient area has been transformed into a surplus-grain commune. Other crops such as tea, oilseeds, and various economic crops have also seen significant increases in production compared to 1958. The joy of the harvest stirred the cadres and masses in the mountainous area, and people spread the news and praised the leadership of the Party.

The Baidian People's Commune, established only a little over a year ago, has achieved such great success in grain production because the commune party committee conscientiously implemented the Party's two-pronged approach of "multiple planting, more harvests, high yield, and more harvests," and it is the result of mobilizing the masses to tap the potential for increased production. The Party's policy of "multiple planting, high yield, and more harvests" was warmly embraced by the vast cadres and masses in the mountainous area, who are actively fighting to achieve a yield of 1,000 jin per mu. Brigades and production teams at all levels formulated plans for multiple planting and high yields, launching a mass movement where everyone contributed ideas and suggestions for tapping the potential for increased production. Various places held numerous symposiums with experienced farmers to gather suggestions for increased production, repeatedly revising and solidifying the plans, and also carrying out competitions and evaluations.

In addition to adhering to the principle of "politics first, ideology leading the way," launching mass movements, and implementing the policy of "multiple planting, high yield, and more harvests," this commune also explored the potential for increased production and found methods that "cost little but yield big results."

In addition, a high work efficiency movement was launched, vigorously promoting tools such as rice transplanters, seeders, and deep plows, which ensured the victory in every battle of agricultural production throughout the year.

The expansion of the multiple cropping area and the substantial increase in grain production in Baidian People's Commune last year powerfully prove the tremendous superiority of the people's commune in tapping the potential for increased production. It further proves the correctness of the Party's two-pronged approach of "multiple planting, more harvests, high yield, and more harvests" for developing agricultural production.

    多种  高产  多收	中共安徽广德县委第一书记　张芳
    刮民党时真凄凉：旱魔山洪挡不住，百姓吃的野菜汤；苛捐杂税像虎狼，逼得家破又人亡。
    解放以后变了样：驯山治水保丰收，豺狼虎豹一扫光；从此生活有保障，丰衣足食喜洋洋。
    这两首顺口溜是广德县柏垫人民公社的社员们，解放前后生活的真实写照。
    小集体比单干强，大集体更强。1958年，人民公社成立了，她一出现，在粮食生产上就充分显示了“一大二公”的无比优越性。党提出“多种、高产、多收”方针以后，更加鼓舞了广大干群的生产积极性。公社党委依靠群众智慧，利用山区柴多、草多的特点，大烧包子，大烧土灰粪，深翻土地，大施绿肥，提高地温，修塘筑坝，晒水灌田，提高水温，保证早熟作物早播，晚熟作物丰收，选育和引种早熟、高产、耐寒良种，征服了自然，使复种指数大大提高，由1958年的141％增加到173％，粮食产量突飞猛进。广新大队粮食亩产已超过八百斤，并有二十一亩双季稻，亩产达一千零二十九斤。有史以来的缺粮地区，一跃变为余粮社。其他茶叶、油料、多种经济都比1958年有很大的增产。丰收的喜悦，激动了山区的干群，人们奔走相告，纷纷歌颂党的领导。
    柏垫人民公社建立才一年多的时间，在粮食生产上就获得了这样巨大的胜利，是公社党委认真贯彻执行党的“多种多收，高产多收”两条腿走路的方针的结果，是发动群众大挖增产潜力的结果。党的“多种、高产、多收”方针传到了山区，受到了广大干群的热烈拥护，都积极为实现亩产千斤而战。各大队、生产队层层制定多种、高产规划，掀起了人人为挖掘增产潜力献计献策的群众运动，各地都多次召开老农座谈会，吸取增产建议，反复修改，把规划订得扎扎实实，并且开展竞赛评比。
    这个公社除了坚持政治第一，思想先行和大搞群众运动，贯彻“多种、高产、多收”方针，还挖掘增产潜力，找出了“花钱少，增产大”的方法。
    此外，还开展了高工效运动，大力推广了插秧机、播种机、深耕犁等工具，这些都保证了全年农业生产上，每一个战斗的胜利。
    柏垫人民公社，去年复种面积的扩大，粮食生产大幅度的增长，有力地证明了人民公社在挖掘增产潜力方面的巨大优越性。更进一步证明了党提出的发展农业生产的“多种多收，高产多收”两条腿走路方针的正确性。
