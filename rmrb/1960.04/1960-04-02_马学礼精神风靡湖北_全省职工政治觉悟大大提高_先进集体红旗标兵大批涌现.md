    The extensive campaign to learn from Ma Xueli among workers in Hubei Province has deeply rooted Ma Xueli’s communist ideology and style in the hearts of the people, greatly transforming the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of workers. Currently, the situation on Hubei Province's entire industrial front is getting better and better, with many units showing a vivid picture of "red flag pacesetters forming forests, advanced machine tools forming rows, labor competitions forming networks, and technological innovations forming sets."
    The movement for workers in Hubei Province to learn from Ma Xueli gradually took shape after the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a resolution to launch the movement in December last year.
    Ma Xueli’s spirit of trusting the masses, trusting the Party, and daring to innovate has pointed out a clear direction for the broad masses of workers to move forward. When Fang Lieying, a female worker at the Shashi Knitting Factory, was carrying out technological innovation to automate the processes of changing yarn, joining, cutting, and taking off socks on the seam closing machine, she once wavered due to the fierce opposition from conservative thinking. However, after studying Ma Xueli’s deeds and establishing the idea of firmly relying on the Party and the masses, her confidence greatly increased. Despite repeated failures, she was not discouraged. Finally, with the support of the Party branch and the joint efforts of her team members, she overcame numerous difficulties and automated the six processes of the seam closing machine. Wang Duoying, a worker at the Wuhan Xinghuo Underwear Factory, studied Ma Xueli’s style, continuously innovating and improving operating methods, which increased work efficiency by more than three times. At the same time, she also actively helped the workers in her group and her competition rivals, teaching them her experience, thereby doubling the output of her group and earning it the title of advanced group.
    The in-depth development of the movement to learn from Ma Xueli has greatly promoted the communist spirit of "stepping up when encountering difficulties and yielding when receiving honors," and greatly enhanced the sense of responsibility of the broad masses of workers as masters of their own affairs. They closely linked their fate with the fate of the Party, the country, and the factories and enterprises, consciously working diligently and selflessly to build a socialist country at high speed, putting personal interests, honors, and positions aside. At the end of last year, during the wage adjustment and the awarding of the Leap Forward Prize, a touching scene of workers humbly yielding to each other, resolutely requesting not to be promoted, and not to receive awards appeared in many factories. The communist spirit of collaboration has also been greatly promoted. For example, in the march towards mechanization and automation, factories such as the Wuhan Hanchang Machinery Factory could not convert their belt lathes into backpack and gear lathes because they lacked electric motors. After learning about this, the Qiaokou Electric Motor Factory took the initiative to take out thirty electric motors and sent them to the Hanchang Machinery Factory with gongs and drums to support the factory.
    Under the influence of the spirit of Ma Xueli, thousands upon thousands of advanced individuals and advanced collectives in the style of Ma Xueli have emerged, powerfully promoting the technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanizing and semi-mechanizing manual operations. In the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory, where Ma Xueli worked, hundreds of advanced individuals in the style of Ma Xueli and dozens of advanced teams and groups in the style of Ma Xueli have emerged. In Shashi, the number of advanced workers and collectives in the style of Ma Xueli that have emerged in the past three months is even in the thousands. These advanced individuals and advanced collectives actively lead the masses, break down conservative thinking, vigorously engage in technological innovation, and constantly create all kinds of miracles. For example, the workers of the casting steel group five, an advanced group in the style of Ma Xueli at the Daye Steel Plant in Huangshi City, under the encouragement of the slogan "Do as Ma Xueli did," realized sixty-four innovation proposals in January and February alone, and overfulfilled the task for the first half of the year in less than two months.
    Currently, driven by Ma Xueli’s thought and style, the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution throughout Hubei Province is surging forward with even greater momentum.

### 马学礼精神风靡湖北  全省职工政治觉悟大大提高　先进集体红旗标兵大批涌现

    马学礼精神风靡湖北
    全省职工政治觉悟大大提高　先进集体红旗标兵大批涌现
    本报讯　湖北省广大职工深入开展学习马学礼运动，已使马学礼的共产主义思想和共产主义风格深入人心，广大职工群众的精神面貌大大改观。目前，湖北省整个工业战线的形势越来越好，许多单位已出现“红旗标兵成林，先进机台成列，劳动竞赛成网，技术革新成套”的生动局面。
    湖北省职工群众学习马学礼的运动，是在去年12月中共湖北省委作出了开展学习马学礼运动的决议后逐步形成的。
    马学礼相信群众、相信党和勇于革新的精神，为广大职工指出了前进的明确方向。沙市针织厂女工方烈英为使缝尖机换纱、接头、割头、下袜等工序自动化而进行技术革新时，曾因受到保守思想的激烈反对而动摇；可是，当她学习了马学礼的事迹后，树立了坚定地依靠党、依靠群众的思想后，信心大大地增强了，虽经多次失败也没有气馁，最后终于在党支部的支持和同队工人的共同努力下，克服了重重的困难，使缝尖机的六个工序实现了自动化。武汉市星火内衣厂工人王多英学习马学礼的风格，不断革新和改进操作方法，使工作效率提高三倍多。同时，她还积极地帮助同组的工人和自己的竞赛对手，把自己的经验教给了她们，从而使她所在的小组产量翻了一番，被评为先进小组。
    学习马学礼运动的深入开展，使“见困难就上，见荣誉就让”的共产主义风气大大发扬，广大职工主人翁觉悟大大提高。他们把自己的命运跟党、国家和工厂企业的命运紧密地联系在一起，自觉地为高速建成社会主义国家而辛勤忘我地劳动，把个人利益、荣誉和地位置之度外。去年年终进行工资调级和评发跃进奖时，不少厂出现了工人互相谦让、坚决要求不提级、不发奖的动人局面。共产主义的协作之风，也大大地发扬了。例如，在向机械化、自动化进军中，武汉市汉长机器等厂因为缺少电动机，没办法将皮带车床改为背包式和齿轮车床；硚口电机厂知道后，就主动拿出三十台电动机，敲锣打鼓地送到汉长机器厂去支援了这个厂。
    在马学礼精神的影响下，成千上万的马学礼式的先进人物和先进集体涌现出来了，有力地促进了手工操作机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。仅马学礼所在的武汉重型机床厂，就已经涌现了上百的马学礼式的先进人物和几十个马学礼式的先进班、组。在沙市，近三个月来涌现的马学礼式的先进工人和集体更是数以千计。这些先进人物和先进集体，积极带动群众，大破保守思想，大闹技术革新，不断地创造出各式各样的奇迹。像黄石市大冶钢厂马学礼式的先进小组——铸钢五组的工人们，在“照马学礼那样干”这一口号的鼓舞下，仅1、2月份就实现革新建议六十四项，不到两月就超额完成了上半年的任务。
    目前，以马学礼思想和风格为动力，整个湖北省的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，正以排山倒海之势，更加汹涌澎湃地向前发展。
