Editorial:

    The Second Session of the Second National People's Congress has triumphantly concluded. Delegates from all regions, nationalities, social strata, and work positions across the country, concentrating the will and aspirations of the people nationwide, adopted the 1960 National Economic Plan, the 1959 National Final Accounts and 1960 National Budget, the National Agricultural Development Program Outline for 1956-1967, and the corresponding three reports submitted to the Congress. The Congress also approved the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The members of the Second Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, held concurrently with this Congress, also attended the important meetings of the Congress and discussed relevant important reports. Both congresses also listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on the current international situation and China's foreign relations. These two congresses are mobilizing the people of the whole country to continue their great leap forward towards new great goals. The loud voices from the rostrum of the Congress expressed the ambition of the people of the whole country to continue building socialism at a high speed. The Congress called on the people of the whole country to unite under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, to strive to fulfill and overfulfill the 1960 National Economic Plan, to realize a better continuous leap forward in the last three years of the Second Five-Year Plan, and to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.
    The 1960 National Economic Plan approved by the Congress is a plan for continued leap forward. The 1960 National Budget approved by the Congress is a budget to ensure the continued leap forward of the national economy. According to the already determined plan, the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1960 will increase by 23% compared with 1959, of which the total industrial output value will increase by 29% and the total agricultural output value will increase by 12%. Among the main industrial products stipulated in the plan, the output of iron will reach 27.5 million tons, steel will reach 18.4 million tons, coal will reach 425 million tons, and power generation equipment will reach 3.3 million kilowatts; among agricultural products, the output of grain and cotton will increase by about 10%. This plan makes reasonable arrangements for strengthening the technical transformation and support of agriculture, for strengthening weak links (such as railways, electricity, mining, non-ferrous metals, petroleum, synthetic rubber and other industrial sectors), for the comprehensive development of all industrial sectors with steel as the key link and the comprehensive development of all agricultural sectors with grain as the key link, for the simultaneous development of large and medium-sized and small enterprises, and for accelerating the development of scientific, cultural and educational undertakings. There is no doubt that the realization of this plan will make China's national economy leap forward better and more comprehensively; it will make it possible for China to catch up with and surpass Britain in terms of the output of major industrial products in less than ten years. Judging from the industrial production situation in the first quarter of this year, it is entirely possible to fulfill and overfulfill the 1960 plan. The total industrial output value in the first quarter has reached 64.29 billion yuan, completing about 30% of the annual plan, an increase of about 80% over the same period last year, and the average daily output value has increased by about 14% compared with the fourth quarter of last year. The call made by the Party Central Committee that the production level in the first quarter of this year should not be lower than that in the fourth quarter of last year has been victoriously realized. The situation on the transportation, capital construction, and financial and trade fronts is also excellent. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation has swept across the country and all walks of life. According to statistics from more than 40 key cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, more than 6 million technical innovation proposals have been implemented in the industrial, construction, and transportation sectors in the first quarter, and 1.24 million workers in industry and construction alone have been transferred from manual operation to mechanized and semi-mechanized operation. With the rapid development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the labor productivity of employees in the national industrial sector in the first quarter increased by 87% compared with the same period last year, saving more than 1.3 million labor forces and supporting departments that urgently need to be strengthened. Now, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is booming along the correct scientific and national track. Units with a low degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization are launching a powerful offensive against heavy physical labor and cumbersome manual operations; units that have basically realized mechanized and semi-mechanized production are striving towards the direction of automation and semi-automation without stopping. Thousands of technologically innovative creations have opened up an ever-widening path for our continued leap forward. Faced with the great victory in implementing the national economic plan in the first quarter and the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we are more confident in fulfilling and overfulfilling this year's national economic plan.
    The National Agricultural Development Program approved by the Congress is a great program for the high-speed development of China's socialist agriculture and the construction of a new socialist countryside. The Congress called on all farmers and the people of the whole country to strive to realize the National Agricultural Development Program two or three years ahead of schedule. The National Agricultural Development Program was announced by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in January 1956 in the form of a draft. The results of the implementation in various parts of the country over the past four years have proved that this great program has mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses, promoted the rapid development of China's agricultural production and rural economic and cultural undertakings, and promoted the development of the entire national economy. Now that it has been unanimously approved by the National People's Congress and published as a formal document, it will certainly play a greater mobilizing role in China's future agricultural production and construction. Over the past four years, especially since 1958, China's agricultural production and rural construction have achieved great achievements under the brilliant light of the General Line and the National Agricultural Development Program. In 1959, the total output value of national agriculture and sideline industries increased by more than 45% compared with 1957. At the same time, 28% of the counties in the country, namely 504 counties, completed the grain production targets stipulated in the Program, and 20% of the cotton-growing counties, namely 204 counties, reached and exceeded the cotton production targets stipulated in the Program. This is a very favorable condition for us to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. After achieving an all-round victory in agricultural production in 1959, the farmers across the country, under the leadership of the Party, launched a vigorous winter production upsurge. After the efforts of last winter and this spring, the country has expanded and improved the irrigation area by 290 million mu, afforested 250 million mu, and animal husbandry centered on pig raising has also been greatly developed. At the same time, the movement to reclaim wasteland has also achieved great results. According to statistics from 20 provinces and regions, 50 million mu of cultivated land has been newly reclaimed, which is equivalent to more than 60% of the total area of wasteland reclaimed during China's First Five-Year Plan period, which has opened up a new front for agricultural production to further implement the policy of "taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way" and "multiple high-yield and multiple harvest." The spring plowing and sowing work this year has been grasped earlier, better, faster, and with higher quality than in previous years. The spring sowing task can be basically completed in mid-April. All this has created a good start for realizing a better and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year. Of course, to realize this year's plan for continued leap forward in agriculture, especially to realize the National Agricultural Development Program two or three years ahead of schedule, is not only a matter for the members of the rural people's communes across the country, but also a common and important task for the people of the whole country. That is to say, it is necessary to mobilize and organize the strength of the whole Party and the whole people to support agriculture, and to mobilize and organize various departments such as industry, transportation, finance, finance, trade, science, education, culture, health, and sports to strengthen their support for agriculture. In this regard, significant progress has been made in the first quarter of this year. The output of major industrial products serving agricultural production increased particularly rapidly in the first quarter. Compared with the same period last year, tractors increased by 8.3 times, grain combine harvesters increased by 3.8 times, agricultural water pumps increased by 83%, pesticides increased by 1.3 times, and chemical fertilizers increased by 1.4 times. We believe that by further consolidating and developing the people's communes and strengthening support for agriculture in all aspects, we will be able to successfully complete and overfulfill this year's agricultural production plan and lay a solid foundation for realizing the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.
    In this Congress, the issue of urban people's communes received widespread attention. It can be seen from the speeches of many representatives that a new, large-scale, and magnificent urban people's commune movement has emerged. It can be predicted that in a not too long period of time, cities across the country will gradually realize the people's commune, just like the vast rural areas. As everyone knows, as early as the summer and autumn of 1958, in the Great Leap Forward and the rural people's commune movement, many cities successively piloted a number of people's communes. After more than a year of consolidation, improvement, and development, the population participating in urban people's communes has now exceeded 20 million. Most cities in Henan, Hebei, Heilongjiang and other provinces have basically realized the people's commune. Many cities have also set up a large number of street industries, welfare undertakings, and service undertakings, further organizing the economic life of urban residents, which is the foundation for establishing urban people's communes. The Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party once pointed out: "In the future, the people's communes in cities will also become a tool for transforming old cities and building new socialist cities in a form suitable for the characteristics of cities, becoming a unified organizer of production, exchange, distribution, and the welfare of the people's life, and becoming a social organization combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers and integrating government and communes." The entire practice of the first batch of urban people's communes piloted over the past year has powerfully proved that the Party's conclusion on urban people's communes is completely correct. It has demonstrated strong vitality in developing production and organizing life, further liberating women's labor force, thoroughly transforming old cities, and further building new socialist cities. Urban people's communes are the inevitable product of China's political and economic development and the inevitable trend of the development of the urban socialist movement after the all-round leap forward of socialist construction and the realization of communization in the vast rural areas. Party committees at all levels, especially urban party committees, should actively lead this historically significant movement with full enthusiasm. According to the existing experience in various places, in leading the urban people's commune movement, we should conscientiously implement the principle of active leadership and voluntary participation, and have not only comprehensive planning and full preparation, but also practical steps to realize the plan, and carry it out in stages and batches. The organizational form of urban communes should also be diverse and varied, adapting to the characteristics of cities that are far more complex and diverse than rural areas. Some can be based on street residents and employees' families, and some can be centered on factories, institutions, and schools. At present, we must first vigorously organize communes based on street residents, and also organize other forms of communes. No matter what kind of commune is organized, it should start with organizing production, and gradually organize people's lives and gradually develop public welfare undertakings and service undertakings according to and adapting to the needs of production development. We should make it clear to all cadres and the masses that in the process of organizing and developing people's communes, we must implement the principle of voluntariness and not immediately require everyone to participate. We should first absorb those who really feel the need and voluntarily request to participate. For those who do not have this need and request at present, or those who feel the need but still have some concerns, they should not only be allowed but also be advised not to force themselves to participate for the time being. When these people decide to participate after thinking it through, a warm welcome attitude should also be adopted. It should also be made clear to all cadres and the masses that whether they have joined the urban commune or have not joined the commune for the time being, the means of living originally owned by individuals, including houses, furniture, clothing, bedding, bank deposits, etc., still belong to individuals; the necessities of life for those who have not yet joined the commune will still be supplied as usual. Running urban people's communes in a big way is the urgent demand of the broad masses of workers and urban people. We believe that it will surely be warmly supported by more and more people and will surely play an increasingly greater role in China's socialist construction.
    In this congress, many representatives enthusiastically discussed issues related to the cultural revolution in their speeches. This situation shows that with the arrival of the upsurge of economic construction and the upsurge of the people's commune movement, the upsurge of cultural construction is also an inevitable trend. This upsurge began to appear in rural areas last year with the consolidation and development of rural people's communes, and in cities this year with the rapid development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. It is expected that with the arrival of the upsurge of the urban people's commune movement, it will also be formed on a larger scale. Now, the broad masses generally demand to study. We must do everything possible to meet the wishes of the masses, strive to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged workers and peasants and popularize primary school education among school-age children during the Second Five-Year Plan period, and strive to basically popularize junior high school education through two-legged walking during the Third Five-Year Plan period, and at the same time vigorously develop high school, secondary vocational school, and higher education in order to cultivate a powerful scientific and technical team and a Marxist-Leninist theoretical team of the proletariat that are both red and expert. To this end, we must run spare-time schools, agricultural middle schools and other vocational schools in a big way, expand the experiment of teaching reform, appropriately shorten the years of full-time primary and secondary school education, improve the level, control the class hours, increase labor, and open more universities to adapt to the new situation of building socialism more, faster, better, and more economically. The realization of the plan for scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings in this year's national economic plan will create more favorable conditions for completing the twelve-year scientific plan ahead of schedule and climbing the peak of science and culture.
    At present, we have an excellent domestic situation and an excellent international situation. The East wind prevails over the West wind. Socialist forces, national revolutionary forces, and peace and democracy forces have achieved major victories in their repeated struggles against imperialist forces, which has led to a certain degree of easing in the international situation. However, we must also see that US imperialism is still engaged in large-scale arms expansion and war preparations while making some peaceful gestures. The United States still occupies our territory of Taiwan, constantly infringes on our territorial waters and airspace, carries out military threats, and bullies our people. Therefore, the Chinese people must always be vigilant and work together more closely to accelerate the pace of socialist construction. Every extra ton of steel and every extra ton of grain that the Chinese people produce is an extra contribution to world peace. It is precisely for this reason that every time the Chinese people take a huge step forward in socialist construction, they will always fiercely touch the nerves of the imperialist group headed by the United States, making them restless. China's announcement of the targets of the 1960 economic plan, the announcement to complete the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and the announcement to run urban people's communes in a big way have once again shocked the Western world. They have to admit that China's economic plan this year is "continuing to promote the Great Leap Forward" and is "a plan to continue to develop the economy on a large scale"; China's Agricultural Development Program is "a large-scale agricultural plan." They also admit that the news of the Chinese people running urban people's communes in a big way has made "those in the West who criticize the communes completely panic." However, the imperialist propaganda machine is trying to belittle the significance of China's continued leap forward and is wantonly slandering the establishment of urban people's communes, saying that China's economic situation will become "even worse." Look, those imperialist fortune-telling charlatans who determined two years ago that China's Great Leap Forward and people's communes would "collapse" and a year ago determined that China's 1959 economic plan was "fantastic" are now issuing predictions again. It seems that they are not satisfied with losing twice. In the eyes of the Chinese people, the imperialist slander and curses are an encouragement to us. This shows that we are doing the right thing and doing it well. Otherwise, if they only praised us and said good things about us, where would they place us? Wouldn't that be us doing stupid things that would benefit the enemy?
    Facts speak louder than words. We must fulfill and overfulfill the 1960 economic plan, complete the National Agricultural Development Program two or three years ahead of schedule, further carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, further consolidate and develop rural and urban people's communes, and further promote the upsurge of socialist cultural construction. All slanders and curses of imperialism, and even imperialism itself, will eventually be thrown into the garbage heap of history! Let us hold high the victorious banner of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, and hold high the red flag of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and continue to leap forward towards new great goals!

    为完成和超额完成一九六○年国民经济计划而奋斗
    第二届全国人民代表大会第二次会议胜利闭幕了。来自全国各个地区、各个民族、各个社会阶层、各个工作岗位的代表，集中了全国人民的意志和愿望，通过了向大会提出的1960年国民经济计划、1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算、1956年—1967年全国农业发展纲要，以及相应的三个报告。大会还批准了全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。和这次大会同时举行的全国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第二次会议的委员们，也列席了这次大会的重要会议，讨论了有关的重要报告。这两个大会还听取了周恩来总理关于目前国际形势和我国对外关系的讲话。这两个大会，是动员全国人民向新的伟大目标继续跃进的大会。从大会的讲坛上发出的宏亮的声音，表达了全国人民继续高速度建设社会主义的雄心壮志。大会号召全国人民，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，团结一致，为完成和超额完成1960年的国民经济计划，为实现第二个五年计划后三年的更好的继续跃进，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗。
    大会批准的1960年国民经济计划，是一个继续跃进的计划。大会批准的1960年国家预算，是保证国民经济继续跃进的预算。根据已经确定的计划，1960年工农业总产值将较1959年增长23％，其中工业总产值将增长29％，农业总产值将增长12％。计划规定的工业主要产品中，铁的产量将达二千七百五十万吨，钢将达一千八百四十万吨，煤将达四亿二千五百万吨，发电设备将达三百三十万瓩；农业产品中，粮食和棉花的产量都将增长10％左右。这个计划对于加强对农业的技术改造和支援，对于加强薄弱环节（如铁路、电力、采掘、有色金属、石油、合成橡胶等工业部门），对于以钢为纲的工业各部门的全面发展和以粮为纲的农业各部门的全面发展，对于大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，对于加速科学文教事业的发展，都作了合理的安排。毫无疑问，这个计划的实现，将使我国国民经济跃进得更好、更全面；将使我国有可能用比十年更少的时间在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国。从今年第一季度的工业生产情况看来，完成和超额完成1960年的计划是完全可能的。第一季度的工业总产值已经达到六百四十二亿九千万元，完成全年计划的30％左右，比去年同期增长了80％左右，平均日产值比去年第四季度增长了14％左右。党中央提出的今年第一季度的生产水平不低于去年第四季度的号召已经胜利实现。交通运输、基本建设和财政贸易战线上，也是一派大好的形势。以机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动已经席卷全国各地和各行各业。据北京、上海等四十多个重点城市的统计，工业、建筑业和交通运输部门第一季度已经实施的技术革新建议就有六百多万件，仅工业和建筑业就有一百二十四万工人由手工操作转为机械化和半机械化操作。随着技术革新和技术革命运动的迅速发展，第一季度全国工业部门职工的劳动生产率比去年同期提高了87％，节省出劳动力一百三十多万人，支援了急需增强的部门。现在，技术革新和技术革命运动正沿着正确的科学的全民的轨道蓬勃发展。机械化半机械化程度还很低的单位，正向笨重的体力劳动和繁琐的手工操作展开强大的攻势；已经基本上实现了机械化半机械化生产的单位，又马不停蹄地朝自动化半自动化的方向努力。千千万万技术上革故鼎新的创举，为我们开拓了越走越宽的继续跃进的大道。面对着第一季度执行国民经济计划的巨大胜利和技术革新技术革命运动的蓬勃发展，我们对完成和超额完成今年的国民经济计划更加充满了信心。
    大会批准的全国农业发展纲要是高速度发展我国社会主义农业和建设社会主义新农村的伟大纲领。大会号召全体农民和全国人民为提前两年或三年实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗。全国农业发展纲要是中共中央1956年1月以草案的形式公布的。四年来全国各地执行的结果证明：这个伟大的纲领，调动了广大群众的积极性，促进了我国农业生产和农村经济文化事业的迅速发展，并且推动了整个国民经济的发展。现在，它经全国人民代表大会一致通过，并作为正式文件公布，一定会在我国今后的农业生产、建设中发挥出更加巨大的动员作用。四年来，特别是1958年以来，我国的农业生产和农村建设，在总路线和全国农业发展纲要的光辉照耀下，获得了伟大的成就。1959年全国农副业总产值比1957年提高45％以上，同时全国有28％的县份即五百零四个县完成了纲要上规定的粮食生产指标，有20％的植棉县即二百零四个县达到和超过了纲要上规定的棉花生产指标。这是我们能够提前实现全国农业发展纲要的十分有利的条件。在取得1959年农业生产全面胜利之后，全国农民又在党的领导下开展了轰轰烈烈的冬季生产高潮，经过去冬今春的努力，全国已经扩大和改善灌溉面积二亿九千万亩，造林二亿五千万亩，以养猪为中心的畜牧业也得到了巨大的发展，同时，开垦荒地的运动，也已经取得了很大的成绩，据二十个省区统计，已新垦出耕地五千万亩，相当于我国第一个五年计划期间垦荒面积总和60％以上，这就为农业生产进一步贯彻执行“以粮为纲，全面发展”和“多种高产多收”方针开辟了新的阵地。今年的春耕春播工作各地都比往年抓得早，抓得好，进度快，质量高，4月中旬就可以基本完成春播任务。这一切都为实现今年农业生产更好更全面的跃进创造了良好的开端。当然，要实现今年的农业继续跃进的计划，特别是要提前两三年实现全国农业发展纲要，不单是全国农村人民公社社员们的事情，也是全国人民的共同的重大任务。这也就是说，需要动员和组织全党全民的力量来支援农业，动员和组织工业、交通、财政、金融、贸易、科学、教育、文化、卫生、体育等各个部门加强对农业的支援。在这方面，今年第一季度已经有了显著的成绩。第一季中为农业生产服务的主要工业产品的产量增加得特别快，同去年同期比较，拖拉机增长了八点三倍，谷物联合收割机增长了三点八倍，农业用水泵增长83％，农药增长一点三倍，化肥增长一点四倍。我们相信，进一步巩固和发展人民公社，同时加强各方面对农业的支援，我们就一定能够胜利完成和超额完成今年农业生产计划，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要打下坚实的基础。
    在这次代表大会中，城市人民公社问题受到了普遍的重视。从许多代表的发言中可以看出：一个新的声势浩大、波澜壮阔的城市人民公社化运动已经出现。可以预料，在不太长的时间内，全国各个城市将像广大农村一样，逐步实现人民公社化。大家知道，早在1958年夏秋之间，在大跃进、农村人民公社化运动中，许多城市都先后试办了一批人民公社。经过一年多以来的巩固、提高和发展，目前参加城市人民公社的人口已经超过二千万人。河南、河北、黑龙江等省的多数城市，已经基本上实现了人民公社化。许多城市还举办了大批街道工业、福利事业和服务事业，把城市居民的经济生活进一步组织起来，这是建立城市人民公社的基础。党的八届六中全会决议中曾经指出：“城市中的人民公社，将来也会以适合城市特点的形式，成为改造旧城市和建设社会主义新城市的工具，成为生产、交换、分配和人民生活福利的统一组织者，成为工农商学兵相结合和政社合一的社会组织。”一年多以来试办起来的第一批城市人民公社的全部实践已经有力地证明，党的关于城市人民公社的断论是完全正确的，它在发展生产和组织生活，进一步解放妇女劳动力，彻底改造旧城市，进一步建设新的社会主义城市方面，已经显示出了强大的生命力。城市人民公社是我国政治经济发展的必然产物，是社会主义建设全面大跃进和广大农村实现公社化以后，城市社会主义运动发展的必然趋势。各级党委特别是城市党委应当以满腔热情，积极领导这一具有伟大历史意义的运动。根据各地已有的经验，在领导城市人民公社运动中，应该认真贯彻积极领导、自愿参加的原则，既要有全面的规划和充分的准备工作，又要有实现规划的切实步骤，分期分批地进行。城市公社的组织形式，适应于城市远较农村复杂多样的特点，也应当是多种多样的，有的可以街道居民和职工家属为主，有的可以工厂、机关、学校为中心，而当前首先要大力组织以街道居民为主的公社，同时也要组织其他形式的公社。无论组织哪一种的公社，都应当从组织生产入手，并根据和适应生产发展的需要，逐步组织人民生活，逐步发展公共福利事业和服务事业。应当向全体干部和群众讲清楚，在组织发展人民公社的过程中，一定要贯彻自愿原则，不要马上要求所有的人统统都参加。首先应当吸收那些确实感到需要而又自愿要求的人参加。对于那些目前还没有这种需要和要求的人，或者虽然感到需要但又还有一些顾虑的人，不但允许而且应当劝他们暂时不要勉强参加。这些人在想通了以后决定参加时，也应当采取热情欢迎的态度。还应当向全体干部和群众讲清楚，无论参加了城市公社的人，还是暂时没有参加公社的人，原属于个人所有的生活资料，包括房屋、家具、衣被、银行存款等等在内，仍归个人所有；对于那些还没有参加公社的人的生活必需品仍照常进行供应。大办城市人民公社是广大职工和城市人民的迫切要求。我们相信，它一定会得到越来越多的人的热烈拥护，一定会在我国社会主义建设事业中发挥越来越大的作用。
    在这次大会中，许多代表在发言中热烈地讨论有关文化革命的问题。这个情况表明，随着经济建设高潮和人民公社运动高潮的到来，文化建设高潮也是不可避免的必然趋势。这个高潮，在农村里，早在去年就随着农村人民公社的巩固和发展开始出现，在城市里，今年也随着技术革新和技术革命运动的猛烈发展而开始出现，预计随着城市人民公社运动高潮的到来，也必将在更大的范围内形成。现在，广大群众普遍要求学习。我们一定要千方百计地满足群众的愿望，力争在第二个五年计划期间基本上在青壮年工农群众中扫除文盲和在学龄
  儿童中普及小学教育，力争在第三个五年计划期间用两条腿走路的办法基本上普及初中教育，同时大力发展高中、中等专科和高等教育，以便培养出无产阶级的又红又专的强大的科学技术队伍和马克思列宁主义理论队伍。为此，就要大办业余学校，大办农业中学等职业学校，扩大教学改革的试验，在全日制的中小学教育中适当缩短年限、提高程度、控制学时、增加劳动，开办更多的高等学校，适应多快好省地建设社会主义的新形势。实现今年的国民经济计划中有关科学文教事业的计划，将为提前完成十二年科学规划、攀登科学文化的高峰创造更加有利的条件。
    目前，我们国内是一派大好形势，国际上也是一派大好形势。东风浩荡，西风日衰。社会主义力量、民族革命力量和和平民主力量在同帝国主义力量的反复斗争中，已经取得重大胜利，使国际局势出现了一定程度的和缓。但是，我们也不能不看到，美帝国主义一边做出某些和平姿态，一边仍然在进行大规模的扩军备战。美国仍然侵占着我国领土台湾，不断地侵犯我国领海和领空，进行军事威胁，欺侮我国人民。因此，我国人民必须经常保持警惕，并且要更加齐心合力，加快社会主义建设的速度。我国人民多生产一吨钢，多生产一吨粮食，就是对世界和平多作出一分贡献。正是因为这样，我国人民在社会主义建设事业中每逢迈出一个巨大的步伐，就总要剧烈地触动以美国为首的帝国主义集团的神经，使他们坐立不安。我国宣布1960年经济计划的指标，宣布要提前完成全国农业发展纲要，宣布要大办城市人民公社，又一次使西方世界感到吃惊。他们不得不承认：我国今年的经济计划同去年一样是“继续推行大跃进”，是“继续大规模发展经济的计划”；我国农业发展纲要是“规模宏大的农业计划”。他们并且承认我国人民大办城市人民公社的消息使西方“那些批评公社的人完全慌了手脚”。但是，帝国主义的宣传机器又力图贬低我国继续跃进的意义，并且大肆诬蔑城市人民公社的建立，说什么中国经济情况将变得“更加恶劣”。请看，那些在两年前断定中国大跃进和人民公社将要“崩溃”，一年前断定中国1959年经济计划是“异想天开”的帝国主义算命瞎子们，现在又在发表预言了。看来他们输了两次还嫌不够。在我国人民看来，帝国主义的诽谤和诅咒，对于我们是一种激励。这说明我们做得对，做得不错。否则，如果他们一味称赞我们，尽是说我们好话，那将置我们于何地呢？那岂不是我们做了有利于敌人的蠢事吗？
    事实胜于雄辩。我们一定要完成和超额完成1960年的经济计划，提前两三年完成全国农业发展纲要，进一步开展技术革新和技术革命运动，进一步巩固和发展农村和城市人民公社，进一步推动社会主义文化建设的高潮。帝国主义的一切诽谤、诅咒以至帝国主义本身，终将被抛到历史的垃圾堆里去的！让我们高举马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的胜利旗帜，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，向新的伟大目标继续跃进吧！
