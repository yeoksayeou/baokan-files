Xinhua News Agency, 11th, London: The British "Daily Mail" reported on April 4th that Robert Sobukwe, President of the Pan-Africanist Congress of South Africa, issued a statement calling on the South African people to start with the struggle against the "Pass Laws" and to fight against racial discrimination, moving towards a new and independent Africa.

Sobukwe's statement was issued before the start of the anti-"Pass Laws" movement in Sharpeville. The statement called on the African people of South Africa to launch a positive and decisive action against the "Pass Laws" from March 21, 1960, to 1963, and to continue the movement against racial discrimination.

The statement said: "At this stage of the struggle, we need to make a choice. Are we still prepared to be subhuman beings on the land of our ancestors, or are we prepared to be male and female citizens of a democratic, non-racial South Africa?"

The statement said: "How long will we continue to starve in our rich motherland? How much longer will eleven million of us be without rights, without suffrage, and without a voice in our own country? What do the white bosses who oppress us use to fatten themselves? African children, we need to make a choice. Slave or free, that's the question."

The statement also said that in this movement, the Pan-Africanist Congress will absolutely not use violence.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th, Durban: The South African Federal Government once again sent a large number of military police on the 10th to raid Cato Manor, an African residential area near Durban. About 1,500 military police, under the cover of more than ten armored vehicles, began a house-to-house search from 5:00 a.m., and more than 300 Africans were arrested.

Cato Manor has always been one of the main centers of African opposition to the brutal rule of the authorities in South Africa. On March 31, Africans there held a demonstration demanding the release of their leaders who had been arrested the day before, which was suppressed by the police.

On the 10th, the situation was also tense in Johannesburg and other places in South Africa.

    南非泛非主义者大会号召南非人民
    加强斗争走向新的独立的非洲
    南非军警在德班附近继续进行疯狂搜捕
    据新华社11日讯　伦敦消息：  4月4日英国“每日邮报”报道，南非泛非主义者大会主席索布克韦发表声明，号召南非人民从反对“通行证法”开始，进行反对种族歧视的斗争，走向一个新的和独立的非洲。
    索布克韦的这项声明是在沙佩维尔的反“通行证法”运动开始以前发表的。声明号召南非非洲人民从1960年3月21日到1963年止发动一个反对“通行证法”的积极的决定性行动，并且继续进行反对种族歧视的运动。
    声明说：“在这个斗争阶段，我们需要作出选择。我们仍准备在祖国的土地上当似人非人的生物呢，还是准备作为一个民主的没有种族歧视的南非的男女公民？”
    声明说：“我们在富饶的祖国里，忍饥挨饿要到什么时候呢？我们一千一百万人在自己祖国内处在没有权利、没有选举权和没有发言权的地位，还要继续多久呢？压迫我们的白人大老板是用什么来养肥自己的？非洲的儿女们，我们需要作出选择。是作为奴隶，还是作为自由人，事情就是这样。”
    声明又说，在这个运动中，泛非主义者大会绝对不使用暴力。
    据新华社11日讯　德班消息：南非联邦政府10日又派出大批军警再次袭击了德班附近的非洲人居民区卡托马诺尔。约一千五百名军警在十多辆装甲车掩护下从早晨五时起开始进行了一天挨户搜捕，有三百多名非洲人被捕。
    卡托马诺尔一直是南非非洲人反对当局残暴统治的主要中心之一。3月31日，那里的非洲人曾举行示威，要求释放前一天被捕的他们的领袖，遭到了警察的镇压。
    10日，在南非约翰内斯堡等地，局势也很紧张。
