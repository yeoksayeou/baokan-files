    Film in our country is a powerful tool for educating the people with socialist and communist ideology, coordinating with production and construction, promoting advanced technological experiences, and enriching the cultural life of the masses. Film distribution and screening work is to deliver films to the broad audience, so that films can better play a role in propaganda and education, and serve the socialist construction cause, which is a work with extremely strong political and ideological nature. With the overall leap forward in industry and agriculture and the rapid development of the film industry, film distribution and screening work has also achieved great success in the past two years. The number of screening units nationwide has reached 14,565 (excluding military figures), of which 87% are distributed in industrial and mining areas and rural areas. The supply of copies for screening to the vast rural areas and some industrial and mining areas and the military has also increased several times compared with the highest annual supply before the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, ethnic minorities, and residents living in mountainous areas, islands, and remote areas have the opportunity to watch movies. In the past two years, there have been 7.01 billion viewers (excluding military figures), exceeding the cumulative number of 6.82 billion viewers in the previous eight years. In 1959 alone, the number of viewers reached 4.14 billion.

    With the development of film distribution and screening work, our films have increasingly profoundly influenced the spiritual world of tens of billions of viewers a year, powerfully cooperating with the development of the socialist construction cause. The broad masses of viewers have improved their class consciousness and stimulated revolutionary enthusiasm and a strong will to overcome difficulties. The three sisters' projection team in Laishui Town, Zhuozhou County, Hebei, used the film "Miner's Lamp" to compile contrasting materials about the lives of miners before and after liberation for propaganda. After the screening, the old workers said with tears, "Before liberation, we couldn't eat enough, we couldn't wear warm clothes, and the foremen would either beat or scold us, we were worse than cattle and horses; now we have become the masters of the coal mine, if we don't work hard, how can we be worthy of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" All the miners expressed their determination, and the next day's production immediately increased from 150 tons per day to 200 tons per day. After many excellent films such as "Under the Brilliant Illumination of the General Line," "Shangganling," "Thousands of Rivers and Mountains," and "Daughter of the Party" were screened in many units, the Party committee immediately held a discussion meeting, combined with the local situation at the time, and produced a great political effect. Many places named their production teams or construction sites after the heroic figures in the films, becoming a powerful spiritual force for overcoming difficulties and promoting production. There are also many vivid examples of films inspiring labor enthusiasm and promoting technological innovation on various production fronts. The advanced figures and advanced deeds in the films have become role models for viewers to learn from, and they even proposed to create new achievements for the motherland in order to get on the screen. After the film "Beside the Sanba River" was screened in the Pumu Management District on the Jinsha River, five local women automatically formed a shock team to participate in fertilizer accumulation work. They excitedly said to the Party branch secretary, "Chen Shuzhen in the film is a woman, and we are also women, are we just going to watch others and slack off?" Those newsreels that timely reflect the era and new people and new things, as well as scientific and educational films introducing advanced technology, are even more warmly welcomed by the audience. They praised these films as vivid teaching materials for carrying out socialist education and imparting scientific and technological knowledge. They often watch the films repeatedly, record them sentence by sentence, draw patterns, and quickly set off a wave of learning new technologies. Scientific and educational films such as "Eight-Character Constitution for Guaranteed Harvest" and "Flying in the Sky" have received widespread attention in rural areas and construction sites. Some viewers said on the spot: "If it can be done in the film, we can do it!" The development of film distribution and screening work has also greatly enriched the people's cultural life, making films an indispensable spiritual food in the daily life of the masses.

    Film distribution and screening workers are a Party propaganda force that connects with the masses most widely. Under the strong leadership of the Party, they correctly implemented Chairman Mao's literary and art policy. Especially after the decentralization of the film distribution system, under the leadership and attention of the central and provincial, municipal, and autonomous region Party committees, as well as county and grassroots Party committees, film distribution and screening work has more closely cooperated with local political movements and the central work of the Party, serving politics and production. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the arrival of the high tide of economic development, the people's lives have gradually improved and been further improved. In particular, the further development of literacy work and the popularization of education has led to an increasing need for cultural life among the broad masses, which has inevitably promoted the rapid development of film distribution and screening work to meet the needs of the people's cultural life. This is the foundation for the development of the film industry.

    Under the education of the Party, the ideological outlook of film distribution and screening workers has also undergone great changes, and they have gradually realized that the work they shoulder is an important political and ideological work of the Party. In their work, they have more fully exerted revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity, thereby exerting a huge political role with limited material conditions and accumulating rich experience. Whether it is selecting films for the audience, developing and distributing copies, or organizing the audience and coordinating propaganda with the central task, a series of organizational work embodies the principle of putting political standards first. The broad masses of projection team members travel over mountains and ridges all year round, tirelessly going deep into the basic audience of workers, peasants, and soldiers, striving to improve their ideological level and professional ability, not only are they good projectionists, but they also convey the Party committee's instructions anytime and anywhere, calling on the masses to complete the current central task, and praising the exemplary deeds of advanced figures. They often write their own materials and paintings, using slides, folk songs, clapper talks, and other literary forms that the masses love to see and hear, vividly combining with the films to carry out propaganda work, further enriching the propaganda and combat power of the films themselves, forming a versatile propaganda force on the literary and art front. In the past two years, under the encouragement of the Party's general line, there has also been a great improvement in projection technology, and rich achievements have been made in technological innovation. Especially in the rural screening work with poor conditions, the widespread application of simple daylight screens has provided very favorable conditions for farmers to watch movies during their rest time. Recently, with the strong support of the Party committee, the Northeast Cinema in Harbin City, after the hard work of its employees, has achieved fully automated operation of projection with advanced technical level. At present, the technological innovation achievements in many places still need to be further concentrated, exchanged, and rapidly promoted in order to meet the requirements of combining popularization and improvement.

    The achievements in all aspects of film distribution and screening work are very great, playing a good bridge role between film production and the audience. In future work, we must also pay more attention to the issue of overall planning and comprehensive arrangements. Our film industry has developed on the basis of "poverty and blankness." Although the speed of development is very fast, various equipment still cannot keep up with actual needs. Therefore, the number of film releases must adapt to the development and needs of national economic construction, and fully improve the utilization rate of copies. In the past, some distribution and screening personnel attached importance to art films and neglected newsreels and scientific and educational short films, and attached importance to urban cinema work and neglected rural and industrial and mining projection team work. Although these phenomena have been greatly changed, we must still strive to overcome the weak links in past work, face the rural areas, strengthen film distribution and screening work in rural areas, more closely cooperate with agricultural production, and serve the 500 million peasant viewers; and we must strengthen the distribution and screening work of newsreels and scientific and educational short films, so that the types of films of "visualized political commentary" and "popularized speeches" can more timely and widely cooperate with production among the audience. In the current great mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution that is vigorously unfolding, we must especially better distribute and screen scientific and educational films.

    Film distribution and screening workers shoulder the important task of carrying out socialist and communist propaganda and education to the broad masses. The work in recent years has been successful. In the future Great Leap Forward, we must also consolidate the achievements we have made, adhere to the general line, implement the Party's policies, strengthen theoretical study, improve political and ideological level and professional ability, and better complete the glorious tasks entrusted by the Party.

    继续提高电影发行放映工作
    杨少任
    我国的电影是以社会主义、共产主义思想教育人民，配合生产建设，推广先进技术经验，并丰富人民群众文化生活的有力工具。而电影发行放映工作则是把电影输送给广大观众，使电影更好地发挥宣传教育作用，为社会主义建设事业服务的一项政治思想性极强的工作。随着工农业的全面大跃进和电影事业的飞速发展，两年来，电影发行放映工作也获得了很大的成绩，全国放映单位已达到一万四千五百六十五个（不包括部队数字），其中87％分布在工矿和农村。为广大农村和部分工矿、部队放映的拷贝供应量，也比大跃进前的最高年度供应量有了成倍的增加。因此，使广大工农兵群众、少数民族，以及住在山区、海岛、边远地带的居民，都有可能看到电影。两年来共有观众七十亿一千万人次（不包括部队数字），超过了前八年六十八亿二千万人次的观众累计数，仅1959年观众数就达到了四十一亿四千万人次。
    随着电影发行放映工作的发展，我们的电影对一年数十亿的观众来说，已日益深刻地影响着他们的精神世界，有力地配合了社会主义建设事业的发展。广大观众提高了阶级觉悟，激发了革命热情和克服困难的坚强意志。河北涿县涞水镇三姐妹放映队在垒子煤矿映出影片“矿灯”时，把解放前后矿工生活编成今昔对比材料进行宣传。映出后，老工人含泪诉说道：“解放前吃不饱，穿不暖，贼工头不是打就是骂，真是牛马不如；如今我们成了煤矿的主人，再不好好干，怎么对得起共产党和毛主席啊！”全体矿工纷纷表示了决心，第二天生产量立即在日产一百五十吨的基础上，提高到日产二百吨。很多优秀影片如“在总路线的光辉照耀下”、“上甘岭”、“万水千山”、“党的女儿”等，在许多单位映出后，党委立即召开座谈会，结合当时当地情况进行讨论，产生了极大的政治效果。不少地方以影片中英雄人物的名字，为自己的生产队或工地命名，成为一种克服困难、推动生产的强大精神力量。电影在各个生产战线上鼓舞劳动热情、促进技术革新的生动事例也很多。影片中的先进人物、先进事迹成为观众的学习榜样，甚至提出要为祖国创造出新的成绩以争取上银幕。影片“三八河边”在金沙江边普木管理区放映后，当地五个妇女自动组成突击队，参加积肥工作。她们激动地对党支部书记说：“电影上陈淑贞是妇女，我们也是妇女，难道只看别人，我们就松劲吗？”那些及时反映时代面貌和新人新事的新闻纪录片，以及介绍先进技术的科教片，更为观众所热烈欢迎。他们赞扬这些影片是进行社会主义教育和传授科学技术的活教材，往往反复看片，逐句记录，描绘图样，并迅速掀起学习新技术的热潮。科教片“八字宪法保丰收”“天上飞”等在农村、工地受到了普遍重视，有的观众当场表示：“电影上能干，咱就办得到！”电影发行放映工作的发展，也大大地丰富了人民文化生活，使电影成为群众日常生活中不可缺少的精神食粮。
    电影发行放映工作者是联系群众最广泛的一支党的宣传队伍。在党的坚强领导下，正确地执行了毛主席的文艺方针。特别是电影发行体制下放以后，在中央和各省、市、自治区党委以及县委、基层党委的领导和重视下，电影发行放映工作更加紧密地配合了当地的政治运动和党的中心工作，为政治、为生产服务。大跃进以来，随着经济发展高潮的到来，人民的生活逐步得到提高和进一步改善。特别是扫盲工作、普及教育工作的进一步发展，广大群众对文化生活的需要也日益增长，因而促使电影发行放映工作必然要迅速发展，以满足人民文化生活的需要，这是电影事业发展的基础。
    在党的教育下，电影发行放映工作者的思想面貌也起了很大变化，逐渐认识清楚自己所肩负的工作是党的一项重要的政治思想工作。在工作中更加充分发挥了革命积极性和创造性，因而以有限的物质条件发挥了巨大的政治作用，也积累了丰富的经验。无论为观众选择影片，洗印分配拷贝，以及组织观众，配合中心任务进行宣传等一系列的组织工作中，都体现了政治标准第一的原则。广大放映队员更是长年翻山越岭，不辞艰辛地深入到工农兵基本观众中去，努力提高自己的思想水平和业务能力，不仅是好的放映员，而且随时随地传达党委指示，号召群众完成当前中心任务，表扬先进人物的模范事迹。他们经常自己编写材料和绘画，利用幻灯、民歌、快板等群众喜闻乐见的文艺形式，生动地结合影片进行宣传工作，更加充实了影片本身的宣传战斗力量，形成了一支文艺战线上多才多艺的宣传队伍。两年来，在党的总路线的鼓舞下，放映技术方面也有了很大的提高，在技术革新上获得了丰富的成果。尤其是在条件较差的农村放映工作中，像简易的白昼银幕的普遍应用，为农民利用休息时间看电影，提供了十分有利的条件。最近哈尔滨市东北影院在党委大力支持下，经过职工的艰苦努力，实现了全部以自动线来操作放映，出现了先进的技术水平。目前许多地方的技术革新成就，还有待于进一步集中交流、迅速推广，以达到普及与提高相结合的要求。
    电影发行放映工作各方面的成绩都是很大的，在制片与观众之间起到了很好的桥梁作用。在今后的工作中，还要更加注意到统筹兼顾、全面安排的问题。我们的电影工业是在“一穷二白”的家底上发展起来的，尽管发展速度很快，但各种设备还赶不上实际的需要。因此对影片发行数量，要适应国家经济建设的发展和需要，充分提高拷贝的使用率。过去在一部分发行放映人员中重视艺术片，轻视新闻、科教短片，重视城市影院工作，轻视农村、工矿放映队工作的现象，虽然已有了极大改变，但是还要努力克服过去工作中的薄弱环节，面向农村，加强农村中的电影发行放映工作，更紧密地配合农业生产，为五亿农民观众服务；并要加强新闻、科教短片的发行放映工作，使“形象化的政论”及“通俗化的演讲”的片种，在观众中更及时、广泛地密切配合生产，在目前正在轰轰烈烈开展的伟大的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中，尤其要更好地发行、放映科教片。
    电影发行放映工作者身负着向广大群众进行社会主义、共产主义宣传教育的重任，几年来工作是有成绩的，在今后的大跃进中，我们还要巩固已取得的成绩，坚持贯彻总路线，贯彻党的方针政策，加强理论学习，提高政治思想水平和业务能力，更好地完成党所交付的光荣任务。
