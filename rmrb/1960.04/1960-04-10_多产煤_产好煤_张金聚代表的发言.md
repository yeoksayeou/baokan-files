Comrades Representatives:
    I fully support the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian. Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report vividly summarizes the great achievements of last year's Great Leap Forward and puts forward inspiring and grand plans. I am determined to take practical action to fight for the realization of this year's plan.
    I am a worker from the Red Flag Tunneling Team of the Tongchuan No. 1 Coal Mine in Shaanxi. During the Great Leap Forward last year, our tunneling team was responsible for the tunneling and development of the main rock roadways of the coal mine. Under the inspiration of the Party's General Line, all the comrades in the team greatly boosted their revolutionary zeal and completed the annual tunneling plan ahead of schedule with the speed of the Great Leap Forward. Our team's annual tunneling plan for last year was 780 meters, and we actually completed 974 meters, completing 104.96% of the national plan, entering 1960 eighty days ahead of schedule. The annual average monthly progress was 81.2 meters, reaching the national requirement of 80 meters per month for high-speed roadway rock roadways.
    In last year's Great Leap Forward, we deeply realized that as long as politics are in command, ideology leads the way, we adhere to the General Line, and boost revolutionary zeal, we can overcome all difficulties and achieve victory. In June last year, our tunneling team encountered the hardest quartz sandstone that had not been encountered for many years in production. Generally, only twelve drill bits were used in a shift to break down ordinary rock, but this kind of quartz sandstone could not be broken down even with sixty drill bits in a small shift. The rock was so hard and the drill rods were in short supply. At that time, our mine had only a little over one hundred Zhongfeng steel drill rods. Under such circumstances, some people sang a sad tune and said strange things, saying things like "Advanced teams will not be able to complete the task when they encounter difficulties," "Advanced teams are not superior to others," and so on. They stood by and waited for us to bow our heads to difficulties. However, all the comrades in our team did not forget Chairman Mao's words, and everyone unanimously expressed: We will never surrender to difficulties, we must boost greater enthusiasm, the whole team must be of one mind and work together to overcome difficulties and continue the Great Leap Forward. The Party branch secretary, technicians, veteran workers, and young workers all discussed together and put forward three solutions: First, use different sizes of drill bits to make holes, using the large ones first and then the small ones, the large ones to open the way and the small ones to drill deep; second, use salt water to dip in the fire to solve the problem of insufficient hardness of the drill bit; and third, implement a shallow drilling method and multiple cycles to increase the tunneling speed. As a result, we not only overcame the stubborn rock, but also increased the tunneling progress of each small shift from 0.3 meters to about 1 meter. We continued to leap forward. But then another problem came up. The roof was broken and the shed collapsed, making it impossible to work in parallel. This seriously affected the progress. This time, we not only did not slacken our efforts, but also had even greater confidence and greater enthusiasm. Because we understand that it would be strange if there were no difficulties on the road of the Great Leap Forward, and that we can overcome one difficulty and we can overcome all difficulties. Under the leadership of the Party branch secretary, we still worked with technicians and workers to study and adopt the round iron short track movable legless shed and railway connection support method to solve the problem of poor roof collapse. We continued to leap forward again. In this way, we combined hard work, practical work, and ingenuity, overcame many difficulties, and increased the monthly progress from the original 80 meters to 133.5 meters. The annual tunneling plan was completed ahead of schedule.
    In the process of overcoming difficulties and completing the plan, we deeply realized that the leadership of the Party and the General Line are the fundamental guarantees for continuing the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, after successfully overfulfilling last year's plan, all the comrades in our team have invested in this year's production with even greater enthusiasm. Under the call of the Party, we have held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, and launched a mass movement to learn from the advanced and help the backward. We have improved the air distributor and the semi-automatic hook of the rock loading machine, promoted the advanced methods of parallel operation and four-shift cross operation, and made full use of working hours to improve production efficiency, and have achieved a good start, monthly red, and monthly overfulfillment of the production plan without increasing manpower. For example, the plan for January was 105 meters, and 127 meters were completed; the plan for February was 120 meters, and 161.4 meters were completed; the plan for March was 150 meters, and by March 22, 165.5 meters had been completed.
    In order to achieve a greater leap forward in coal production this year, we must implement the spirit of Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report with greater enthusiasm, earnestly carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, reform tools, and comprehensively and systematically realize the mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation of tunneling tools and loading and transportation, accelerate tunneling speed, and strive to achieve a monthly progress of 500 meters, strive to catch up with the national advanced production level, and strive to produce more coal, produce good coal, and achieve a greater leap forward in coal production.

### 多产煤　产好煤  张金聚代表的发言

    多产煤　产好煤
    张金聚代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告。李富春副总理的报告生动的总结了去年大跃进的伟大成就，提出了鼓舞人心的宏伟计划。我坚决以实际行动为实现今年的计划而斗争。
    我是陕西铜川第一煤矿红旗掘进队的工人。我们掘进队在去年大跃进中，担负了煤矿主要岩石大巷的掘进开拓工程。全队同志，在党的总路线的鼓舞下，大鼓革命干劲，以跃进的速度，超额完成了全年的掘进计划。我队去年全年掘进计划是七百八十米，实际完成了九百七十四米，完成了国家计划104.96％，提前八十天跨进了1960年。全年平均月进八十一点二米，达到了国家高速巷道岩巷月进八十米的要求。
    去年的大跃进中，我们深深体会到只要政治挂帅，思想领先，坚持总路线，鼓足革命干劲，就能克服一切困难，取得胜利。去年6月，我们掘进队，在生产中，碰到了多年没有碰到过的最坚硬的石碤砂岩。一般岩石，一个班只用十二个钻钎就打下来了，这种石碤砂岩，一个小班用了六十根钻钎还打不下来。岩石这样硬，钻杆又缺，当时我们矿上的中凤钢钻杆不到一百多根。在这种情况下，有些人唱凉腔，讲怪话，说什么“先进队碰到困难也是一样完不成任务”，“先进队也并不比别人高一头、大一膀”等等。他们站在一旁，等待我们向困难低头。可是，我们全队同志并没有忘记毛主席的话，大家一致表示：绝不向困难投降，要鼓足更大的干劲，全队一条心，扭成一股劲，战胜困难，继续跃进。党支部书记、技术员、老工人、青年工人；大家一起商量，提出了三条办法：一是用大小不同的钻头打眼，先使大的，后使小的，大的开路，小的深钻；二是用盐水蘸火，解决钎子硬度不够的问题；三是实行浅打眼，多循环的办法，提高掘进速度。结果，不但战胜了顽强的岩石，还把每个小班掘进零点三米提高到一米左右。我们继续跃进了。可是后来问题又来了。顶板破碎，光倒棚子，不能平行作业。严重的影响了进度。这一回，我们不但没有松劲，而且信心更高，干劲更大。因为，我们懂得，跃进的道路上如果没有困难才是怪事，我们能战胜一个困难，就能战胜一切困难。我们还是在党支部书记的领导下，同技术员、工人们一起研究，采用了圆铁短道活动无腿棚和铁道连接护棚法，解决了顶板不好倒棚子的问题。我们又继续跃进了。我们就这样的把苦干、实干和巧干结合起来，克服了许多困难，把月进由原来的八十米提高到一百三十三点五米。超额完成了全年的掘进计划。
    在战胜困难，完成计划的过程中，使我们深刻的体会到，党的领导、总路线，是继续大跃进的根本保证。因此，我们全队同志，在胜利的超额完成了去年计划之后，干劲更足地投入了今年的生产，在党的号召下，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，大搞技术革新和技术革命，开展了见先进就学，见落后就帮的群众运动。改进了分风器和装岩机半自动挂钩，推广了平行作业和四班交叉作业的先进方法，并且分秒必争地充分利用工时，提高生产效率，在增产不增人的情况下，使生产月月上升，实现了开门红、月月红、月月超额完成了生产计划。如1月份计划一百零五米，完成了一百二十七米；2月份计划一百二十米，完成了一百六十一点四米；3月份计划一百五十米，到3月22日，已完成了一百六十五点五米。
    为了实现今年煤炭生产的更大跃进，我们一定要以更大的干劲，贯彻执行李富春副总理报告的精神，认真地大搞技术革新和技术革命，改革工具，全面系统地实现掘进工具和装运的机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化，加速掘进速度，力争实现月进五百米，争取赶上全国先进生产水平，为多产煤、产好煤，实现煤炭生产的更大跃进而斗争。
