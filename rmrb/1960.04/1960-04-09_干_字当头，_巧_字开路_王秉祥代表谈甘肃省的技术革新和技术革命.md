"Do" Comes First, "Cleverness" Opens the Way
Delegate Wang Bingxiang Discusses Technological Innovation and Technological Revolution in Gansu Province
The movement develops from points to areas, from simple to complex, from shallow to deep, from single piece modification, piecemeal modification, partial modification, to complete set modification, comprehensive modification, and systematic modification. Fellow Delegates:
I completely agree with and support the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. Now, I will give a speech to the conference on the development of technological innovation and technological revolution in Gansu.
Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, with the continuous leap forward of the national economy and the increasing awareness of the broad masses, technological innovation and technological revolution have developed into a massive nationwide movement. The characteristics of this movement's development process are from small to large, from low to high, from points to areas, from simple to complex, and from shallow to deep. That is, from the past single piece modification, piecemeal modification, and partial modification, to complete set modification, systematic modification, and comprehensive modification; from modification on the original basis to major innovation and creation centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation; from mastering and promoting general scientific and technological achievements to beginning to march towards "high, large, cutting-edge, and new"; from industry, agriculture, transportation, and construction, sweeping to commerce, finance, service industries, and cultural health and other departments.
Since the beginning of this year, the movement has entered a new upsurge. The progress is rapid, the impact is deep, and the momentum and scale are getting bigger and bigger, forming a new situation of everyone innovating, everything innovating, and every industry innovating. The broad masses of workers in Lanzhou City have put forward more than 387,000 rationalization proposals in just two and a half months, which is more than 70% of the total for last year. More than 104,000 pieces have been realized, of which more than 4,100 are relatively major reforms. At present, there are 467 sets of advanced experiences and technologies in the city, with 167 assembly lines, 69 production linkage lines, and 178 automatic and semi-automatic lines. Many encouraging and vivid examples have emerged in the movement. Workers at the Lanzhou Water Pump Factory fought for three days and all put down their hammers, realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization. The workers happily said: "This time, we are going to send the hammer to the museum." Workers at the General Machinery Factory modified the cupola furnace, increasing the output from two tons of iron per ton of coke to fifty tons. After learning from their experience, the Comprehensive Machine Tool Factory quickly increased it to fifty-three tons. The Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau made 24 electric analog computers in five days, realizing electrical calculation and increasing work efficiency by five to thirty times. At present, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in Lanzhou's industrial enterprises has increased from 37.89% at the beginning of the year to 60%; construction and installation enterprises have increased from 26.5% to 51.3%.
In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, we resolutely implemented the policy of walking on two legs, combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay. When the Yanguoxia Hydropower Station project started in September 1958, there were no on-site facilities, no mechanical equipment, only some iron shovels and pickaxes. There were also very few technicians. Over the past two years, they have adhered to the combination of indigenous and foreign methods. If there are foreign methods, they use them; if not, they first use indigenous methods. They fully mobilized the masses and adopted the method of designing, preparing, and constructing simultaneously, and organized large-scale collaboration. Relying on the masses, they used indigenous methods to create indigenous equipment, overcoming numerous difficulties and solving many major key problems. The grass-earth cofferdam is a prominent example. If the original design of a rockfill cofferdam was adopted, the cost would be 1.28 million yuan, requiring 2,500 cubic meters of wood and a large amount of stone, which would not be easy to obtain for a while, and would inevitably delay the time and affect the progress of the entire project. The workers proposed using a grass-earth cofferdam instead of a rockfill cofferdam, saving 800,000 yuan in cost, saving a lot of materials and labor, and shortening the construction time. In the interception, the masses created an indigenous loading platform, which not only overcame the difficulty of insufficient electric shovels, but also created a new record of loading twelve tons of stones in three seconds, which was even more efficient than electric shovels. During winter construction, they broke with convention, boldly innovated, and created an amazing record of pouring concrete dams up to fifteen meters high in one go. In this way, they launched a heroic and tenacious struggle against the Yellow River, and finally, in a dry season from the winter of 1958 to the spring of 1959, they successively passed the four barriers of cofferdam, spillway dam foundation excavation, spillway dam concrete pouring, and cutting off the Yellow River's turbulent flow, winning high speed and ensuring the early completion of the first phase of the project.
Engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution is by no means a general tool reform issue, but a matter of developing productive forces and enabling the national economy to continuously develop at high speed on a new technological basis. Especially in our Gansu, which is poorer and more backward, with great differences and large construction tasks, we must engage in it on a large scale. Taking the solution of the shortage of labor as an example, only by engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution on a large scale can we find a fundamental way out. Through the large-scale indigenous mechanization movement in the Intrtahe [likely a typo in original for 引洮, Yintao] project, 87,000 people completed the workload that would have required 400,000 people in the past in October 1959, increasing work efficiency by 4.6 times. If we only see the shortage of labor, but not the great potential to be tapped and the urgent need to reform and innovate many tools and operating methods, and do not touch these things, then we can only be faced with the word "difficult," and the problem will never be solved. On the contrary, if we "do" first and "cleverness" opens the way, boldly innovate, and achieve increased production without increasing manpower, and one person can do the work of several people, the so-called problem of labor shortage will be easily solved. It also shows that a poor foundation does not mean that innovation cannot be carried out. A poor foundation will inevitably encounter more difficulties, but on the other hand, the potential is also greater. Once innovation is carried out, it is easiest to see immediate results and have a new look. The Qingcheng Iron Factory in Yuzhong County was originally a factory with poor equipment conditions. All the workers, with the spirit of "making revolution with a kitchen knife," worked hard and cleverly. In just over two months, they innovated and created 65 kinds of tools, more than 3,200 pieces, realizing cableway transportation in the air, vehicle transportation on the ground, mechanized operation in front of the furnace, and electrified driving. Not only did they overfulfill the production plan by more than double and saved more than 40,000 yuan in funds, but also reduced the labor force from 1,000 people to 200 people. There are many such examples. Similarly, a good foundation does not mean that innovation is not needed. The air compression workshop of the Lanzhou Chemical Plant carried out a series of innovations, which increased the output of synthetic ammonia by two and a half times compared to the original design. Modern enterprises often need to solve bigger and more complex problems, and once innovation is carried out, it can produce huge effects. It can be seen that any industry and any unit has great potential to be tapped, and technological innovation and technological revolution have a lot to offer.
It is precisely because of this that the broad masses want to innovate more and more, and want to work harder and harder. Technological innovation and technological revolution have begun to become a need in the lives of the masses, and have become conscious and joyful creative labor. The great liberation of thought has promoted the great development of productive forces, and the great development of productive forces, in turn, has promoted the further liberation of thought. In this way, complementing each other, the movement has always maintained a spiral advance, creating a development situation with wave after wave higher than the previous one.
The vigorously developing technological innovation and technological revolution movement is a great revolutionary movement in politics, economy, culture, and ideology. The development of the situation is changing rapidly, new inventions and creations are emerging one after another, and a large number of new problems are presented to us every day. This requires us to seize this great situation, further strengthen leadership, solve a series of new problems arising in the movement, and carry out the technological innovation and technological revolution movement extensively and deeply in all walks of life and in all aspects. According to the different foundations, different conditions, and different requirements of different industries, we should strive to quickly realize mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, and promote the high-speed development of the national economy; we should more earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, arm the broad masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and guide this great revolutionary movement. Only in this way can we promote the continuous and deeper development of the movement, continuously create greater achievements, and make the vehicle of technological innovation and technological revolution move forward endlessly.
Through several years of practice, we have the following preliminary experiences. First, technological innovation and technological revolution must be persevered in to the end and cannot be abandoned halfway. Where there is a will, there is a way. This means that we must have strong confidence and perseverance and not be afraid of failure. Failure is the mother of success. Second, we must distinguish between different situations, focus on key issues, organize battles, and, when necessary, concentrate the main forces on the main attack direction, break through key points, and drive the overall situation. Third, we must combine theory with practice, combine indigenous and foreign methods, walk on two legs, and implement the three-way combination of leadership, workers, and technicians. Enable the broad masses to have the opportunity to show their talents. At the same time, it can give full play to different characteristics according to local conditions and tap the potential strength of all aspects. Fourth, we must organize large-scale collaboration. The more the movement develops, the more collaboration is needed. The wider the scope of collaboration, the greater the strength, and the richer the content. In particular, we must vigorously strengthen the support of industry for agricultural technological transformation, which is an important issue related to consolidating and developing the worker-peasant alliance. Fifth, we must combine the creation, summary, and promotion of advanced experiences and advanced technologies to quickly raise the advanced level of a few people and a few units to the level of the whole society. Sixth, we must continuously improve labor organization and management level to make the relations of production adapt to the productive forces and the superstructure adapt to the economic base. This is an important key to promoting technological innovation and technological revolution. Seventh, we must combine the technological revolution with the large-scale cultural revolution. The two promote each other and complement each other. The in-depth development of the technological revolution and the continuous innovation of production technology inevitably require the broad masses to continuously improve their scientific and cultural level to meet the needs of the new situation.
We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have already won the great victory of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and will certainly be able to win the great victory of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, so that our country's national economy will be armed with new technologies, so that our worker-peasant alliance will be more consolidated on a new basis, so as to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science in a short period of time, and move towards the highest ideal of mankind - communist society.

    “干”字当头，“巧”字开路
    王秉祥代表谈甘肃省的技术革新和技术革命
    运动由点到面，由简到繁，由浅入深，由单件的改、零星的改、局部的改，发展到成套的改、全面的改、系统的改。各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告。现在，我就甘肃技术革新和技术革命运动的发展情况，向大会作一发言。
    在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，随着国民经济的连续跃进和广大人民群众觉悟的日益提高，技术革新和技术革命，已经发展成为声势浩大的全民运动。这个运动发展过程的特点，就是由小到大，由低到高，由点到面，由简到繁，由浅入深。也就是从过去单件的改、零星的改、局部的改，发展到成套的改、系统的改、全面的改；从在原有基础上的改，发展到以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的重大革新创造；从掌握和推广一般科学技术成就，发展到开始向“高、大、尖、新”进军；从工业、农业、交通、建筑业，席卷到商业、金融、服务行业和文化卫生等各个部门。
    今年以来，运动更进入到一个新的高潮。进展快，影响深，声势与规模愈来愈大，形成了一个人人革新，事事革新，行行革新的新局面。兰州市的广大职工，在短短两个半月的时间里，提出合理化建议三十八万七千多件，等于去年全年的70％以上。已经实现的有十万四千多件，其中，比较重大的改革，就有四千一百多件。现在全市配套成龙的先进经验和技术已有四百六十七条，出现了一百六十七条流水作业线，六十九条生产联动线和一百七十八条自动线、半自动线。运动中涌现出许多令人鼓舞的生动事例。兰州水泵厂职工，大战三天，全部放下鎯头，实现了机械化和半机械化。职工们高兴地说：“这一下要把鎯头送进博物馆去了。”通用机器厂职工改制了冲天炉，由原来一吨焦炭炼两吨铁，提高到炼五十吨，综合机床厂学习他们的经验后，很快提高到炼五十三吨。省建筑工程局在五天之内，制成电模拟计算机二十四台，实现计算电气化，提高工效五倍到三十倍。现在，兰州全市机械化、半机械化的程度，工业企业已由年初的37.89％，提高到60％；建筑安装企业已由26.5％，提高到51.3％。
    在技术革新、技术革命运动中，我们坚决贯彻了两条腿走路的方针，土洋结合，以土为主。盐锅峡水电站工程，1958年9月开工时，既没有现场设施，也没有机械设备，只有一些铁锨、洋镐。技工也很少。两年来，他们坚持了土洋结合，有洋的，就用洋的，没有洋的，就先用土法上马。充分发动群众，采取边设计、边准备、边建设的办法，开展快速施工运动，组织大协作。依靠群众，采用土办法创造土设备，克服了重重困难，解决了许多重大的关键问题。草土围堰就是一个突出的例子。如果采用原来设计的堆石围堰，造价要一百二十八万元，需用两千五百立米的木材和大量石料，一时也不易搞到，势必拖延时间，影响整个工程进度。职工们就提出用草土围堰代替堆石围堰，节约造价八十万元，节省了大量材料和劳力，还缩短了施工时间。在截流中，群众又创造土装料台，不但克服了电铲不足的困难，而且创造了三秒钟装十二吨石头的新纪录，比电铲的效率还高。冬季施工，他们打破常规，大胆革新，创造了一次浇筑混凝土大坝高达十五米的惊人纪录。他们就是这样，向黄河展开英勇顽强的斗争，终于在1958年冬到1959年春的一个枯水期内，接连闯过了围堰、溢流坝基坑开挖、溢流坝混凝土浇筑和截断黄河激流四关，赢得了高速度，保证了第一期工程的提前完成。
    大搞技术革新和技术革命，绝不是什么一般的工具改革问题，而是发展生产力，使国民经济不断地在新的技术基础上高速发展的问题。特别是我们甘肃更穷更白，差别性大，建设任务大，更要大搞特搞。就拿解决劳动力不足的问题来说，只有大搞技术革新和技术革命，才是根本的出路。引洮工程通过大搞土机械化运动，1959年10月八万七千人完成了过去需要四十万人才能完成的工作量，提高工效四点六倍。如果只看到劳动力不足的一面，看不到大有潜力可挖、急需改革和革新许多工具及操作方法，不去触动这些东西，那就只能“难”字当头，问题永远解决不了。相反的，“干”字当头，“巧”字开路，大胆革新，做到增产不增人，一人顶几人，所谓劳动力不足的问题，也就迎刃而解。同时也说明，底子差，不等于不能搞革新。底子差，碰到的困难固然会多一些，而另一方面，潜力也比较大。一搞革新，最容易立竿见影，面目一新，榆中县青城铁厂原是一个设备条件较差的厂，全体职工本着“一把菜刀闹革命”的精神，大干巧干，在短短两个多月内，革新创造工具六十五种，三千二百多件，实现了高空运输索道化，平地运输车辆化，炉前操作机械化，开车电动化，不但超额一倍多完成了生产计划，节约资金四万多元，而且使劳动力从一千人减少到二百人。像这样的事例是很多的。同样的，底子好，也不等于不需要搞革新。兰州化工厂空气压缩车间，进行了一系列革新，使合成氨的产量比原设计提高两倍半。现代化的企业，需要解决的往往是更大、更复杂的问题，一经革新，就能产生巨大的效果。可见任何行业、任何单位，都大有潜力可挖，技术革新和技术革命都是大有可为的。
    正是因为这样，广大群众越革越想革，越干越想干，技术革新和技术革命开始成为群众的生活上的需要，成为自觉的、愉快的创造性的劳动。思想上的大解放，促进了生产力的大发展，而生产力的大发展，反过来又促进思想的进一步解放。这样相辅相成，就使运动始终保持螺旋式的前进，造成一浪高过一浪的发展形势。
    正在猛烈开展的技术革新和技术革命运动，是政治上、经济上、文化上和思想上的伟大革命运动。形势的发展日新月异，新的创造发明层出不穷，每天都向我们提出大量的新问题。这就要求我们抓住这个大好形势，进一步加强领导，解决运动中所产生的一系列的新问题，在各行各业、各个方面都广泛深入地开展技术革新和技术革命运动。根据行行业业的不同基础、不同条件和不同要求，力争迅速实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化，促进国民经济高速度发展；要求我们更加认真学习毛主席的著作，以毛泽东思想武装广大群众，指导这一伟大的革命运动。只有这样，才能促进运动不断地向更深入发展，不断地创造出更伟大的成绩，使技术革新、技术革命运动的车子，永无休止地向前飞驰。
    经过几年来的实践，我们有这样几点初步体会。第一，技术革新和技术革命，要坚持到底，不能半途而废，有志者事竟成。这就是说，要有坚强的信心和毅力，不怕失败。失败是成功之母。第二，要分别不同情况，针对关键问题，组织战役，必要时，把主要力量集中到主攻方面，突破重点，带动全面。第三，要结合实际，土洋并举，两条腿走路，并且实行领导、工人、技术人员三结合。使广大群众都有大显身手的机会。同时，能够因地制宜地发挥不同的特点，挖掘各方面的潜在力量。第四，要组织大协作。运动愈发展，愈需要协作，协作的范围愈广，力量就愈大，内容也愈丰富。特别要大力加强工业对农业技术改造的支援，这是关乎到巩固和发展工农联盟的重要问题。第五，要把先进经验先进技术的创造，总结和推广使用结合起来，使少数人、少数单位的先进水平迅速地提高成为全社会的水平。第六，要不断改进劳动组织和提高管理水平，使生产关系和生产力相适应，上层建筑和经济基础相适应，这是推动技术革新和技术革命的重要关键。第七，要结合技术革命，大搞文化革命，这两者是互相推动，相辅相成的。技术革命深入的开展，生产技术不断革新，必然要求广大群众不断的提高科学文化水平，以适应新形势的需要。
    我们深信，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，我国人民已经取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利，现在也一定能够取得技术革命和文化革命的伟大胜利，使我国的国民经济用新的技术武装起来，使我们的工农联盟在新的基础上更加巩固，以便在不长的时间内，把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国，并向人类的最高理想——共产主义社会迈进。
