A Most Vital Film
Hao Shishan, First Secretary of the CCP Pinglu County Committee, Shanxi

    The film "For Sixty-One Class Brothers," produced by the Beijing Film Studio, has been shown to a wide audience in many cities and villages across the country. The communist-shining figures that appear in this film have left an extremely deep impression on people. Some comrades, upon seeing the part where the people of the capital collaborated to send medicine, were so moved that they burst into tears. The screening of this film is indeed a vivid communist education lesson for the broad masses of people, and it has also given us, the cadres and people of Pinglu, infinite spiritual strength.
    It took only twenty-odd days from the script to the completion of this film. The capital's outstanding artists, with high revolutionary enthusiasm, overcame all difficulties, rushed to the scene to film, everyone racing against time, seizing every second, working day and night, rushing to rehearse and practice. Actors hurriedly read their lines, and the band painstakingly practiced the score. During the filming process, a communist style prevailed throughout the country, giving great support. The rapid completion of this film is itself a communist paean.
    The filming of "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" once again proves the immense power of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought. Only by resolutely implementing the policy of literature and art serving politics and combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers can art gain true life and win the welcome of the broad masses. Therefore, after the film was released, every showing was packed, and the audience watched it again and again. Their common reaction was: "One viewing gives us ten times the effort, two viewings give us a hundred times the confidence." This shows how much the people love art that reflects their own reality!
    Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, with the further deepening of the socialist revolution and the high-speed development of socialist construction, the communist style of "putting others before oneself, sacrificing oneself for others," this new type of class friendship between people, and the communist spirit of collaboration of "one person in trouble, ten thousand people help, one place in difficulty, support from all sides" will inevitably become even more vigorous. Let the communist spirit of the people in the capital bloom more vividly and bear more fruitful results in the minds of the broad masses of people across the country.
    Taking the opportunity of the film's release, let us once again thank the Party and Chairman Mao for their concern for us, and once again pay our respects to the soldiers and civilians and artists of the capital. We will always take the noble communist style of the soldiers and civilians of the capital as a model for learning. Under the leadership of the Party, let us jointly hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fight heroically to complete and overfulfill the tasks of 1960.

    一部最有生命力的影片
    中共山西平陆县委第一书记　郝世山
    北京电影制片厂拍摄的“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”电影，已经与全国许多城乡的广大观众见面了。在这部影片中所出现的闪耀着共产主义光辉的人物形象，给人们留下了极其深刻的印象，有的同志看到首都人民协作送药那一段，激动得热泪盈眶。这部影片的放映，对广大人民来说，确实是一堂生动的共产主义教育课，对我们平陆的干部和人民来说，也给予了无限的精神力量。
    这部影片从编剧到摄成，仅仅用了二十余天的时间。首都优秀的艺术工作者，以高度的革命热情，克服一切困难，奔赴现场进行抢拍，人人抢时间，争分秒，通宵不眠，赶排赶练，演员急读台词，乐队苦练配曲。在拍摄的过程中，全国各地都大兴共产主义风格，给以极大的支援。这部影片能很快拍成，它本身又是一曲共产主义的凯歌。
    “为了六十一个阶级弟兄”影片的拍摄，再一次证明了毛主席的文艺思想的强大力量，只有坚决贯彻文艺为政治服务、与工农兵相结合的方针，艺术才能获得真正的生命，才能取得广大群众的欢迎。所以，影片放映以后，场场满座，观众一看再看，他们共同的反映是：“看一次十分干劲，看两次百倍信心”。这说明人民群众是多么热爱反映他们自己现实生活的艺术呀！
    在党和毛主席的领导下，随着社会主义革命的进一步深入和社会主义建设高速度的发展，人民群众这种“先人后己、舍己为人”的共产主义风格，人与人之间这种新型的阶级友爱关系，“一人有事万人相助，一处困难八方支援”的共产主义的协作精神，必然会更加昂扬。让首都人民的共产主义精神，在全国广大人们的心目中，开出更鲜艳的花朵，结出更丰硕的果实。
    乘影片放映之机，让我们再次感谢党和毛主席对我们的关怀，再次向首都军民及艺术工作者们致以敬意。我们将把首都军民崇高的共产主义风格，永远作为学习的榜样。让我们共同在党的领导下，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，为完成和超额完成1960年的任务而英勇奋战。　（原载山西日报）
