The North Korean "Rodong Sinmun" Comments on the Just Struggle of the South Korean People
The Masan Uprising Demonstrates the National Spirit of the South Korean People
People in Masan and Other Places Continue to Struggle; The Syngman Rhee Group Carries Out Brutal Suppression

(Reported by this newspaper) Pyongyang, April 14th, "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial entitled "Dawn is Coming to the Dark Land - South Korea," commenting on the recent struggle of the South Korean people against the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee.

The editorial pointed out that the uprising of the people of Masan, South Korea, against the fascist rule of the Syngman Rhee group, was not only an outburst of anger from the people of Masan, but also a manifestation of the awareness, will, and hope of millions of oppressed and ravaged masses in South Korea.

The editorial stated that the fifteen years of fascist rule by the US-Rhee group has brought the South Korean people nothing but prisons, gallows, hunger, and poverty. Therefore, the successive uprisings of the people in Masan and the large-scale demonstrations held by the people of Seoul announced to the South Korean people that the people's actions demanding change have erupted, and demonstrated to the world that the national spirit of the Korean people, who have inherited the traditions of patriotic revolutionary martyrs, is being carried forward.

The editorial said, "South Korea, shrouded in the dark clouds of reactionary rule, has begun to experience the great winds before the storm. The tide of the masses opposing the rule of the US-Rhee group is surging everywhere in South Korea." "Today, the South Korean people are no longer just verbally lamenting that they cannot survive, nor are they simply demanding general freedom. Instead, they are demanding the eradication of the root causes of all misfortune and suffering - the Syngman Rhee regime."

The editorial pointed out that "the pillars and beams of the rotten Syngman Rhee puppet ruling structure have begun to make sounds of collapse. The knives and guns of the Syngman Rhee group and the cannons of US imperialism cannot stop the angry tide of the mass movement.

The editorial said: "All situations prove that not only can the South Korean people no longer live as they did before, but the upper ruling clique can no longer live as they did before."

The editorial said that, alarmed by the rise of the people, contradictions and divisions have also occurred within the Syngman Rhee's "Liberal Party." "Syngman Rhee is already in a state of siege on all sides." Syngman Rhee, who is trembling while sitting on a volcano, can now only rely on the knives and guns of US imperialism for support. The arrival of change is inevitable. When the momentum of the masses rises, supporting change and boiling for change, when they are full of awareness of self-sacrifice, victory is inevitable."

The editorial said that the struggle of the South Korean people is a glorious struggle for the future of the nation, and a just struggle for survival, for democracy, and for freedom and rights, which no force can defeat.

The editorial said, "Today's era is not the era of the 'March 1st' Movement forty years ago. The development of the world situation has decisively turned in favor of the Korean people. All peace-loving people in the world condemn the Syngman Rhee group and stand on the side of the fighting Korean people. The days of dawn in the dark and suffering land of South Korea are not far away. The day when 30 million Korean compatriots reunite to live a happy life is also in sight."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 15th: News from Seoul: Despite Syngman Rhee's bloody suppression, the struggle of the people of Masan, South Korea, against the fascist rule of Syngman Rhee continues, and people in nearby cities are also launching struggles.

Five hundred students in Masan gathered today, raised a banner condemning the Syngman Rhee group, and shouted slogans against Syngman Rhee. A new demonstration is brewing. Armed police of the Syngman Rhee group are continuing to carry out arrests and searches. The entire city of Masan is in a tense atmosphere.

In Jinju, west of Masan, one thousand students held a rally today to oppose the dark rule of the Syngman Rhee group. The police used force to prevent the students from holding a demonstration.

In Jeonju, some members of the opposition Democratic Party held a demonstration, but the police arrested them and transported them to the police station by bus.

It is reported that the people of Busan are also continuing to prepare to hold demonstrations against the Syngman Rhee group.

In most cities near Masan, large numbers of police from the Syngman Rhee group are fearfully conducting "security preparations."

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”评南朝鲜人民的正义斗争
    马山起义显示南朝鲜人民民族气概
    马山等地人民继续斗争　李承晚集团进行残暴镇压
    本报讯　平壤“劳动新闻”14日发表题为“黎明即将来到黑暗的土地——南朝鲜”的社论，评论最近南朝鲜人民反对李承晚法西斯统治的斗争。
    社论指出，南朝鲜马山市人民反对李承晚集团法西斯统治的起义，不仅是马山市人民的愤怒爆发了，而且是南朝鲜所有受压迫、受蹂躏的千百万群众的觉悟、意志和希望的表现。
    社论说，美李集团十五年来的法西斯统治，给南朝鲜人民带来的只有监狱、绞刑架、饥饿和贫穷。因此，在马山接连爆发的人民起义和汉城人民举行的大示威向南朝鲜人民宣告，人民要求变革的行动爆发了，并且向全世界表明，继承了爱国革命先烈传统的朝鲜人民的民族气概正在发扬光大。
    社论说，“被反动统治的乌云笼罩着的南朝鲜，开始刮起了暴风雨前夕的大风。群众反对美李集团统治的浪潮在南朝鲜到处汹涌。”“今天，南朝鲜人民已经不只是在口头上喊活不下去，也不仅是要求一般的自由了。而是要求铲除一切不幸和痛苦的祸根——李承晚政权。”
    社论指出，“腐朽透顶的李承晚傀儡统治机构的支柱和大梁已经发出要倒塌的声音。李承晚集团的刀枪和美帝国主义的大炮，都阻挡不了群众运动的怒潮。
    社论说：“一切形势证明，不仅南朝鲜人民再不能像从前那样地活下去，而且上层统治集团也不能像从前那样地活下去了。”
    社论说，由于人民群众起来了，感到惊慌的李承晚的“自由党”的内部也发生了矛盾和分化。“李承晚已经处于四面楚歌的境地。”正坐在火山上发抖的李承晚，现在只有依靠美帝国主义的刀枪来支持了。变革的到来是不可避免的。当群众的气势高涨，支持变革，为变革沸腾起来的时候，当他们充满自我牺牲的觉悟的时候，胜利是必然的。”
    社论说，南朝鲜人民的斗争是为了民族的未来而进行的光荣斗争，是为了求生存、争取民主、自由权利的正义斗争，这是任何力量都不能挫败的。
    社论说，“今天的时代不是四十年前进行‘三·一’运动的时代。世界局势的发展决定性转向对朝鲜人民有利，全世界一切爱好和平的人们都谴责李承晚集团，并且站在战斗着的朝鲜人民的一边。黑暗、苦难的土地——南朝鲜的破晓的日子已经不远了。三千万朝鲜同胞团聚在一堂过幸福生活的日子也可望到来。”
    据新华社平壤15日电　汉城消息：不顾李承晚的血腥镇压，南朝鲜马山人民反对李承晚法西斯统治的斗争仍在继续，并且附近城市的人民也在展开斗争。
    马山五百名学生今天集合在一起，举起了一面谴责李承晚集团的大旗，并且高呼反对李承晚的口号。新的示威正在酝酿中。李承晚集团的武装警察在继续进行逮捕和搜查。整个马山市处在紧张的气氛中。
    在马山市西面的晋州，有一千名学生今天举行集会，反对李承晚集团的黑暗统治。警察用武力阻止学生们举行示威游行。
    在全州，反对党民主党的一些党员举行了示威游行，但是警察把他们逮捕起来，用公共汽车押到警察局。
    据报道，釜山市人民也在继续准备举行反对李承晚集团的示威游行。
    在马山附近的大多数城市里，李承晚集团的大批警察恐惧地进行“戒备”。
