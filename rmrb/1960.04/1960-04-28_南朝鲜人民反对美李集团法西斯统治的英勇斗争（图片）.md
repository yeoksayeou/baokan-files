The heroic struggle of the South Korean people against the fascist rule of the US-Syngman Rhee clique:
    Demonstrators are propagandizing the Syngman Rhee puppet soldiers, asking them to join the demonstrations.
    On April 26, demonstrators in Seoul demolished Syngman Rhee's statue and dragged it through the streets.
    On April 27, demonstrators in Seoul cheered for the victory of their struggle when they heard the news that Syngman Rhee was forced to step down.
    On April 26, demonstrators seized a tank from the Syngman Rhee puppet army that came to suppress them.
    Demonstrators in Seoul, defying police suppression, marched forward shouting the slogan "Down with the dirty government."
    Demonstrators in Seoul seized the fire engine used by the Syngman Rhee puppet police to suppress them and drove it to the front of the American "Embassy" to demonstrate.
    The families of the demonstrators killed by the Syngman Rhee puppet police are mourning their deceased relatives.
    On April 19, demonstrators burned down Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party headquarters, the mouthpiece of the Syngman Rhee group, the "Seoul Shinmun," and the headquarters of the "Anti-Communist Youth Association of Korea," the "Anti-Communist Hall." The picture shows the "Seoul Shinmun" building on fire.
