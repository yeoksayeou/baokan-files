Automation of Chemical Analysis

    Taiyuan Chemical Plant has created three types of automatic analyzers, achieving full-factory chemical analysis automation. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, after the main chemical production workshops of the Taiyuan Chemical Plant realized instrument operation, chemical analysis was basically still manual operation, becoming a weak link in production. The factory Party committee called on employees to advance towards full automation of analysis and control. Zhou Xueliang, a young analytical worker, first successfully created an automatic gas analyzer. Subsequently, the analysts in the central laboratory developed a universal automatic gas timer analyzer, a universal automatic liquid concentration analyzer, and a polarographic automatic analyzer, achieving full-factory chemical analysis automation and completely reversing the situation where analytical control lagged behind production. For example, in the past, the determination of sulfuric acid purity required eighteen analytical steps such as sampling, weighing, titration, and calculation, and a single analysis took five hours. Now, with the automatic analyzer, the purity can be seen immediately with the flick of a switch. The automation of analysis has accelerated the factory's development towards full high automation, instrumentation, and remote control.

    化学分析自动化
    太原化工厂创造出三种自动分析仪，实现了全厂化学分析自动化。太原化工厂在技术革新和技术革命运动中，各主要化工生产车间都实现仪表操纵以后，化学分析基本上还是手工操作，成为生产中的薄弱环节。工厂党委号召职工向分析控制全盘自动化进军，青年分析工周学良首先创造成功了气体自动分析仪，接着中央试验室的分析人员又制成了万能气体自动定时分析仪、万能液体浓度自动分析仪和极谱自动分析仪，实现了全厂化学分析自动化，彻底扭转了分析控制落后于生产的局面。例如硫酸纯度测定，过去要经过取样、称重、滴定、计算等十八道分析工序，单独分析一次要花五小时。现在有了自动分析仪，只要一按开关，立即可以看出纯度。分析的自动化，加快了这个厂向全盘高度自动化、仪表化、遥控化发展的速度。
