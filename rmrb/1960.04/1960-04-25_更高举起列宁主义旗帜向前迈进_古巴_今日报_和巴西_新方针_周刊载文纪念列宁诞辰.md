Xinhua News Agency, Havana, April 24th: The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" published a special issue today commemorating the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth.

    Carlos Rodriguez, member of the Political Bureau of the Cuban People's Socialist Party and director of "Hoy," published an article entitled "Lenin and the Colonial World," pointing out that no one could use science more correctly than Lenin to study the colonial issue. Lenin actively participated in and organized the struggle of colonial and semi-colonial countries to get rid of the imperialist system.

    The article emphasized that at this time, commemorating the birth of Lenin, the brilliant mentor of the socialist revolution, the colonial world is experiencing a major event. The article pointed out that the example of the Cuban revolution shows that "a small country, bound in all aspects by the most powerful country of our time, has set a new starting point for 160 million Latin Americans, who until a few years ago, while seeing the rapid progress of the people of Asia and Africa, painfully pondered their own backwardness." Rodriguez refuted the argument that Latin American countries could not achieve complete freedom while U.S. imperialism exists. He pointed out that the small country promoted by Cuban Prime Minister Castro and his colleagues will surely defeat this argument.

    In an article about Cuba and peaceful coexistence, the deputy director of "Hoy" called on people to be vigilant against imperialism. The article pointed out, "Do not forget that the United States, Britain, and their colonial plunderers are building military bases." The article said that imperialism's cold war "is only to oppose the people and attempt to force people to give up national sovereignty and allow the plunder of their wealth in the clamor of the cold war."

    The special issue also published articles commemorating Lenin by the famous Cuban poet Guillen and others, as well as photos, poems, and drawings about Lenin's life and struggle.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: Rio de Janeiro News: The Brazilian weekly "New Direction" published an article by Jacob Gorender on April 22nd commemorating the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth.

    The author wrote that the great themes of Lenin's works are the themes of our time: the struggle against imperialism; the struggle of the proletariat and all working people for socialism; the question of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between the two world systems of socialism and capitalism; the struggle for peace; the question of the universal right to work for mankind; and the national liberation struggle of the oppressed people.

    The author pointed out that the relevance of Lenin's works lies not only in the consistent vitality of its themes but also in the development of these themes that his works had foreseen. The author said that Lenin lives eternally in the Soviet Union, in the socialist camp, and in the international communist movement.

    The author emphasized that, like his predecessors Marx and Engels, Lenin's immortality is inseparable from the immortality of the cause, which is an inevitable product of historical movement, embodying the true material strength of the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the working masses.

    The article concluded, "Bourgeois ideology operates within a narrow and lifeless range, outside of which it is clearly powerless, while the ideology of Marx, Engels, and Lenin is rich in powerful vitality and infinite creativity. That is why, when we commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth, we feel that Lenin is still alive among us, and we feel that we still hear his language during debates and command of the revolution."

    The same issue of "New Direction" weekly also published another article by Goicondo Dias commemorating the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth.

    The author wrote that one of Lenin's most remarkable characteristics was his constant concern for the education of communist parties in various countries, helping them to learn from the rich experience of the Bolshevik revolutionaries, and guiding the working class and its allies in various countries to strive to achieve their present and future goals. The author wrote that in commemorating the 90th anniversary of Lenin's birth, the Brazilian Communists will pay the highest tribute to the great Lenin by redoubling their efforts to absorb Lenin's inexhaustible teachings and firmly and courageously embodying these teachings in practice.

    更高举起列宁主义旗帜向前迈进
    古巴“今日报”和巴西“新方针”周刊载文纪念列宁诞辰
    新华社哈瓦那24日电　古巴“今日报”今天出版专刊，纪念列宁诞生九十周年。
    古巴人民社会党政治局委员、“今日报”社长卡洛斯·罗德里格斯发表的题为“列宁和殖民世界”的文章指出，没有一个人能像列宁那样最正确地运用科学来研究殖民地问题。列宁积极地参加和组织了殖民地、半殖民地国家摆脱帝国主义制度的斗争。
    文章强调指出，在又一次纪念社会主义革命的英明导师列宁诞辰的时候，在殖民世界正经历着一个重大事件。文章指出，古巴革命的事例表明，“一个在各方面被当代最强大的国家所束缚的小国，为一亿六千万拉丁美洲人树立了一个新的起点的标志，而直到几年以前，拉丁美洲一亿六千万人民还在看到亚非人民迅速前进的同时，痛苦地沉思自己的落后”。罗德里格斯驳斥了那种认为有美帝国主义存在拉丁美洲国家就不可能取得完全的自由的论调。他指出，古巴总理卡斯特罗及其同事推动下的面积很小的国家，定会使这种论调遭到失败。
      “今日报”副社长在一篇谈到古巴和和平共处的文章中，要人们对帝国主义提高警惕。文章指出，“不要忘记，美国、英国及其进行殖民掠夺的同伙正在建立军事基地。”文章说，帝国主义进行冷战“只不过是为了反对人民，并企图在冷战的叫嚣中迫使人们让出民族主权和允许掠夺他们的财富。”
    专刊还刊载了古巴著名诗人纪廉及其他人写的纪念列宁的文章，并且刊登了关于列宁生活和斗争的照片、诗歌和图画。
    新华社23日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西“新方针”周刊22日刊载了雅各布·戈伦德写的一篇纪念列宁诞生九十周年的文章。
    作者写道，列宁著作的伟大主题就是我们时代的主题：进行反帝国主义的斗争；无产者和全体劳动人民争取社会主义的斗争。社会主义和资本主义两个世界体系和平共处和和平竞赛的问题；争取和平的斗争；人类普遍劳动权利的问题；被压迫人民的民族解放斗争。
    作者指出，列宁著作的现实性不仅在于它的主题的始终如一的生气勃勃，而且在于他的著作已经预见到的这些主题的发展。作者说，列宁万古长青地活在苏联、活在社会主义阵营以及国际共产主义运动中。
    作者强调指出，同他的前辈马克思和恩格斯一样，列宁的不朽是同事业的不朽分不开的，这个事业是历史运动不可避免的产物，体现了劳动群众思想、感情和行动的真正物质力量。
    文章最后说，“资产阶级意识形态在狭窄的没有生气的范围内活动，在这个范围之外，它显然是无能为力，而马克思、恩格斯和列宁的意识形态则富有强有力的生命力和无限的创造力。这就是为什么，当我们纪念列宁诞生九十周年的时候，我们感到列宁还活在我们中间，我们感到我们还听到他在进行论战和指挥革命时的语言。”
    同一期的“新方针”周刊还刊载了戈伊孔多·迪亚斯写的另一篇纪念列宁诞生九十周年的文章。
    作者写道，列宁的最显著的特点之一是，他始终关心对各国共产党的教育，帮助它们吸取布尔什维克革命者的丰富经验，并引导各国工人阶级及其同盟军争取达到它们现在和将来的目标。作者写道，在纪念列宁诞生九十周年的时候，巴西共产党人将通过加倍努力来吸取列宁的取之不尽的教导，并且坚定地和勇敢地把这些教导体现到实践中去，来向伟大的列宁表示最崇高的敬意。
