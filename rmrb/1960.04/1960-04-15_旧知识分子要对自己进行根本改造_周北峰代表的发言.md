    Old Intellectuals Must Fundamentally Remold Themselves
    Speech by Delegate Zhou Beifeng

    Fellow Delegates:
    I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Final Accounts and the 1960 National Budget Draft, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I also guarantee to implement them in my work.

    As Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out: In 1959, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we continued to achieve a Great Leap Forward in the national economy, and completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. This is a great victory for the Chinese people, and a great victory for the integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction, i.e. Mao Zedong Thought. I believe that this great victory has not only great political and historical significance in our country, but also great political and historical significance in the world; this great victory further shows that Mao Zedong Thought is a new contribution to the general treasure house of Marxism-Leninism.

    Mao Zedong Thought has always been the banner of victory for the Chinese revolution. Since the national liberation, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have not only changed the material landscape, transforming backward industrial and agricultural production into advanced production, barren mountains into orchards, and deserts into fertile land, so that the poor and blank historical landscape is undergoing tremendous changes every day; but also changed the spiritual outlook of the people, enabling the broad masses of people to break superstitions, liberate their minds, and establish the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. This has transformed all negative factors in the country into positive factors, and people are building socialism and communism with soaring enthusiasm. Recently, I inspected Wuhan, Hubei, and personally saw many moving examples of people exerting their energy and striving for the high-speed construction of socialism. Among them were not only the creative inventions of workers and farmers, but also the labor achievements of intellectuals. Their common conclusion was: "If we act in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, we will surely be victorious."

    I am a bourgeois old intellectual. For more than ten years, I have personally experienced that the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, in the transformation of old intellectuals, has achieved brilliant victories, just as it has in other undertakings. This victory has not only Chinese significance, but also world significance. How was this victory achieved? My experience is:

    First, the Party has adopted a policy of unity, education, utilization, and transformation towards old intellectuals. This policy was put forward by the Party and Chairman Mao based on the needs of the Chinese revolution and the two-sided characteristics of Chinese intellectuals. We know that the Party has always attached great importance to the role of intellectuals. During the period of the New Democratic Revolution, Chairman Mao said: "Without the participation of intellectuals, the victory of the revolution is impossible." During the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, Chairman Mao said again: "China's arduous socialist construction requires as many intellectuals as possible to serve it." And as early as December 1939, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "For all relatively loyal intellectuals who are somewhat useful, appropriate work should be assigned, they should be well educated and led, and their weaknesses should be gradually overcome in the long struggle, so that they can be revolutionized and popularized, so that they can be integrated with old party members and old cadres, and so that they can be integrated with worker-peasant party members." Chairman Mao's instruction is the theoretical basis of the Party's policy of uniting, educating, using, and transforming old intellectuals.

    For more than ten years since liberation, the Party has been earnestly implementing this policy. In the process of accepting transformation, the Party has always given care and consideration to old intellectuals, giving timely encouragement and praise for the slightest achievements and progress of us old intellectuals; giving patient education and waiting for any wavering and consideration on our part; and giving beneficial criticism and help to all our mistakes and shortcomings. Therefore, the vast majority of old intellectuals have been able to continuously improve their political and ideological level, are determined to take the socialist road, and have made certain achievements in their work. Some of them have made rapid progress and have gloriously joined the Party.

    In the past ten years, although I have also been moving forward one step behind the ranks of intellectuals under the cultivation of the Party, the urging of the masses, and the encouragement of the situation, the degree of progress has lagged far behind the requirements of the situation. The only reason I have not fallen behind is the Party's concern and expectation for me. If I do not catch up quickly, I will not only be unworthy of the Party's cultivation and waiting for me, but also be in great danger of being abandoned by the wheels of the times.

    Second, the Party uses the thought of continuous revolution to guide the gradual transformation of old intellectuals. Chairman Mao's thought of combining continuous revolution with the theory of the stages of revolutionary development is an important development of Marxism-Leninism. In the past few decades, under the guidance of this revolutionary thought, our country has achieved a series of victories in various revolutionary stages. Taking liberation as an example, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought of combining continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development, the Party has achieved one victory after another not only on the economic and political fronts, but also on the ideological front. After undergoing political struggles such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, ideological transformation, and rectification and anti-rightist campaigns, the political ideology of millions of intellectuals across the country has been gradually improved, their positions have been gradually changed, they have continuously "promoted proletarian ideology and eradicated bourgeois ideology," continuously continued to move forward, and continuously achieved victories in the ideological revolution. Compared with the early days of liberation, intellectuals in general have made great progress.

    However, this kind of progress still cannot keep up with the needs of the situation in the era of rapid leap forward where "one day equals twenty years." Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "In order to fully adapt to the needs of the new society, and in order to unite with the workers and peasants, intellectuals must continue to transform themselves, gradually abandon the bourgeois world outlook and establish the proletarian, communist world outlook. The transformation of the world outlook is a fundamental transformation, and most intellectuals cannot be said to have completed this transformation." This means that every intellectual must establish the idea of continuous ideological revolution, be determined to gradually and thoroughly transform his bourgeois world outlook, and strive to become a proletarian intellectual who is both red and expert as soon as possible.

    In the past, I thought that I was not too backward and that I had not grasped ideological transformation tightly enough. After studying at the Socialist Academy recently, I deeply realized that not only had my bourgeois world outlook not been completely changed, but also that my bourgeois position had not been fundamentally changed; on the other hand, I more deeply realized the necessity and urgency of fundamental self-transformation. In terms of the development of the situation, we are making great efforts to build socialism, and while transforming the objective world, we must transform the subjective world, and ideological transformation must also leap forward at a rapid pace. From the perspective of work needs, I am participating in the administrative leadership of the Water Conservancy Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. To participate in leadership work, I must have a high level of ideological understanding. It is absolutely impossible to imagine that a person with a strong bourgeois ideology can do the work that he should do well. From the Party's requirements, the first basic point of the general line is: "Mobilize all positive factors." Tens of thousands of intellectuals have improved their political and ideological awareness, boosted their revolutionary energy, and contributed their strength to the socialist construction of the motherland under the encouragement of the general line, and have achieved remarkable results. I cannot "settle for mediocrity" and disappoint the Party's requirements.

    Third, the Party uses the method of linking theory with practice to transform old intellectuals. Linking theory with practice is a universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao's doctrine of the unity of knowledge and practice greatly developed this truth, and guided the Chinese revolution and construction to victory. For many years, the Party has adopted the method of combining ideological education with practice to transform old intellectuals based on this truth, and has also achieved great victories. Over the past decade, the vast majority of intellectuals across the country have, while striving to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, participated in various practical struggles to varying degrees. In their work practice, thanks to the Party's trust and assistance, they worked and studied at the same time, gradually understood the Party's policies and guidelines, improved their professional abilities, and also improved their ideological awareness. In political movements, thanks to the Party's education and the urging of the masses, they gradually drew a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves, leaned towards the Party day and night, and their positions and viewpoints gradually changed, and their ideological feelings also gradually changed. In labor practice, many people have already eaten, lived, and labored with the masses, and have gradually become one with the workers and peasants. Not only have they increased their perceptual knowledge of production in labor and enriched their original rational knowledge, but they have also gradually established the labor viewpoint and the mass viewpoint. In social practice, many people have gradually realized the greatness and loveliness of the new China, the incomparable superiority of socialism, and the infinite wisdom and strength of workers and peasants through visits and interviews. These practices have played a great role in helping old intellectuals sincerely accept transformation.

    However, I had a lazy man's mentality in the past, and an erroneous idea of not attaching importance to practice. I thought that practice meant struggle, and struggle meant suffering. Therefore, for more than ten years, I have been just a little old rational knowledge, and my understanding of the laws of objective things is often something that I dare not even consider to be "accurate." Therefore, in my work, I have shown timidity, shown "not seeking merit, but seeking no demerit," shown weariness and passivity.

    The irrefutable facts prove that Mao Zedong Thought is the red banner of victory for all undertakings in our country, and of course it is also the red banner of victory for transforming old intellectuals. But why is it that under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, some people are transformed quickly, while others are transformed slowly, and even a very small number of people have not been transformed? The key issue is whether or not they sincerely obey the leadership of the Party and earnestly study Chairman Mao's works.

    The reason why I made slow progress in the past was mainly because I was burdened with the baggage of "I also understand a little bit of revolutionary theory," and I did not earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought, and I did not earnestly explore the problems in my own thinking. My obedience to the leadership of the Party was also conceptualized. I thought that it was enough to know the Party's policies and directions in general and to obey the Party's orders. I did not know that I had to solidly approach the Party's grassroots organizations. I must strive to correct this mistake in the future, and guarantee that I will: study Mao Zedong Thought by earnestly studying Chairman Mao's works and the Party's various policies and guidelines, closely approach the Party organization in the organs, accept the Party's education and transformation, and sincerely become a docile tool of the Party. Humbly learn from Party comrades and sincerely accept the opinions of the masses.

    I am determined to firmly grasp the victorious red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in transforming old intellectuals in the future. Under the strict education of the Party and the supervision of the masses, I will earnestly transform myself, enrich myself, and improve myself with Mao Zedong Thought, so that I can contribute everything to the socialist construction and communist construction of the motherland!

    If there is anything inappropriate in this speech, please criticize and correct me, fellow delegates!

    I wish all delegates good health!

### 旧知识分子要对自己进行根本改造  周北峰代表的发言

    旧知识分子要对自己进行根本改造
    周北峰代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算草案的报告和全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告。并且保证在工作中贯彻执行。
    正如李富春副总理所指出：1959年，我们在1958年的大跃进基础上，继续实现了国民经济的大跃进，并且提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。这是我国人民的伟大胜利，这是马克思列宁主义的的普遍真理与中国革命和建设的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我认为这个伟大胜利，不仅在我们国内有极大的政治意义和历史意义，而且在世界范围也有极大的政治意义和历史意义；这个伟大的胜利，进一步说明毛泽东思想，是对于马列主义总宝库的新贡献。
    毛泽东思想一直是中国革命胜利的旗帜。全国解放以来，在毛泽东思想指导下，我们不但改变了物质的面貌，使工农业生产由落后变为先进，使荒山变成果园，沙漠变成良田，使一穷二白的历史面貌，天天在起着巨大的变化；而且也改变了人的精神面貌，使广大人民群众，破除迷信，解放思想，树立起敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。使全国的一切消极因素，变而为积极因素，人们都以冲天的干劲，建设社会主义和共产主义。最近我到湖北武汉视察，亲眼看到很多的鼓干劲，争上游高速度建设社会主义的动人事例，其中不但有工人、农民的创造发明，也有知识分子的劳动成果，他们所得到的共同结论是：“照毛泽东思想办事，一定能够胜利。”
    我是一个资产阶级旧知识分子，十多年来亲身体验到：毛泽东思想的红旗，在对旧知识分子的改造方面也和在其他事业方面一样，同样取得了辉煌的胜利。这个胜利同样不仅有中国的意义，而且有世界意义。这个胜利是怎样取得的呢？我的体会是：
    首先，党对旧知识分子采取了团结、教育、使用、改造的政策。这个政策是党和毛主席根据中国革命的需要和中国知识分子两面性的特点提出来的。我们知道，党是历来很重视知识分子的作用，在新民主主义革命时期，毛主席说过：“没有知识分子的参加，革命的胜利是不可能的。”到社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，毛主席又说：“我国的艰巨的社会主义建设事业，需要尽可能多的知识分子为它服务。”并且远在1939年12月，毛主席就明确指出：“对于一切多少有用的比较忠实的知识分子，应该分配适当的工作，应该好好地教育他们，带领他们，在长期斗争中逐渐克服他们的弱点，使他们革命化和群众化，使他们同老党员老干部融洽起来，使他们同工农党员融洽起来”。毛主席的这个指示，就是党对旧知识分子团结、教育、使用、改造政策的理论根据。
    解放后十多年来，党一直在认真贯彻这个政策，在旧知识分子接受改造的过程中，党无时不给予关怀和照顾，对我们这些旧知识分子的点滴成绩和进步都给予及时的鼓励和表扬；对于我们的任何动摇和考虑，都进行耐心的教育和等待；对我们的一切错误和缺点，都给予有益的批评和帮助。因此绝大多数的旧知识分子，能够不断地提高政治思想水平，决心走社会主义道路，并在工作中做出了一定的成绩。其中有些人进步很快，已经光荣地入了党。
    我在十多年中，虽然也是在党的培养下，在群众的督促下，和在形势的鼓舞下，随在知识分子行列之后，向前走了一步，但是进步的程度却远远落在形势的要求后面。其所以还没有掉队，只是党对于我的关怀和期待。我若再不急起直追，不但对不起党对于我的培养等待，而且有被时代车轮抛弃的极大危险。
    其次，党用不断革命的思想指导旧知识分子的逐步改造。毛主席的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的思想，是对马列主义的重要发展。我国数十年来，在这个革命思想的指导下，取得了各个革命阶段中的一系列的胜利。就以解放以来说，党在毛主席不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的思想指导下，不但在经济战线和政治战线上取得了一个胜利又一个胜利，而且在思想战线上也取得了一个胜利又一个胜利。全国几百万知识分子，经过抗美援朝，土地改革，思想改造，整风反右等政治斗争，思想在逐步提高，立场在逐步转变，不断地“兴无灭资”，不断地继续前进，不断地取得了思想革命的胜利。和解放初期比较，知识分子一般地都有了很大的进步。
    但是这种进步，在“一天等于二十年”的飞速跃进时代里，还是赶不上形势的需要。毛主席在“正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中指出：“为了充分适应新社会的需要，为了同工人农民团结一致，知识分子必须继续改造自己，逐步地抛弃资产阶级的世界观而树立无产阶级的、共产主义的世界观。世界观的转变是一个根本的转变，现在多数知识分子还不能说已经完成了这个转变。”这就是说：每一个知识分子都要树立思想不断革命的思想，下决心逐步彻底改造自己的资产阶级世界观，争取尽早地成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。
    我过去还自认为我不是一个过于落后的，对思想改造抓得不紧。经过最近在社会主义学院的学习，一方面深深认识到自己不但资产阶级的世界观还没有彻底改变，就是资产阶级的立场也还没有根本改变；一方面更深刻地认识到自我根本改造的必要性和迫切性。在形势发展上讲，我们正以极大的努力，建设社会主义，在改造客观世界的同时，必须改造主观世界，思想改造，也必须飞速地跃进。从工作需要上讲，我参加着内蒙古自治区水利厅的行政领导工作，参加领导工作，必须要有较高的思想认识水平，绝对不能设想，一个有着浓厚的资产阶级思想的人，会作好他应该作好的工作。从党的要求讲，总路线的第一个基本点是：“调动一切积极因素”，成千上万的知识分子已经在总路线的鼓舞下提高了政治思想觉悟，鼓足了革命干劲，在祖国社会主义建设事业上贡献出自己的力量，取得了显著成绩。我不能再“甘居中游”辜负党的要求。再次，党用理论联系实际的方法，进行对旧知识分子的改造。理论联系实际是马列主义的一条普遍真理，毛主席的认识和实践统一的学说大大地发展了这条真理，并且指导中国革命和建设取得了胜利。多少年来，党就根据这条真理对旧知识分子的改造，采取思想教育和实践相结合的办法，同样取得了很大的胜利。全国绝大多数的知识分子，十年来在努力学习马列主义和毛泽东著作的同时，不同程度地参加了各种实践的斗争，在工作实践中，由于党的信任和帮助，一边工作，一边学习，逐渐了解了党的政策和方针，提高了自己的业务能力，也提高了自己的思想觉悟。在政治运动中，由于党的教育和群众的督促，逐渐划清了敌我界线，一天一地向党靠拢，立场观点也逐渐改变，思想感情也逐渐改变。在劳动实践中，有不少人已经和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，逐渐和工人农民打成一片，不但他们在劳动中增加了对生产的感性知识充实了自己原来的理性知识，而且逐步地树立起劳动观点和群众观点。在社会实践中有不少人通过参观、访问，逐步认识了新中国的伟大可爱，逐步认识了社会主义的无比优越性，和工人农民无穷的智慧和力量，这些实践，都对旧知识分子真心诚意地接受改造起着很大的作用。
    但是我过去有懒汉思想，有不重视实践的错误思想，认为实践就得斗争，斗争就得吃苦，因而十多年来我还一直是个仅仅有点旧的理性知识，对客观事物的规律认识，往往是连自己也不敢自认为“准确”，因而在工作中，表现为畏缩，表现为“不求有功，只求无过”，表现为疲沓、被动。
    颠扑不破的事实证明毛泽东思想是我国一切事业胜利的红旗，当然也是改造旧知识分子胜利的红旗。但是同样是在毛泽东思想领导下，为什么有的改造的就快，有的改造的就慢，甚至有很少数的人没有得到改造呢？关键问题在于是否真心实意地服从党的领导和认真学习毛主席的著作。
    我过去所以进步慢的原因，主要是背着“我也懂得点革命理论”的包袱，没有认真学习毛泽东思想，没有认真挖掘自己思想上的毛病。对服从党的领导也是概念化的，以为只要概略地知道了党的政策方向，听从党的命令就够了，不知道要踏实地靠近党的基层组织。我今后一定要努力改正这个错误，并且保证作到：通过认真钻研毛主席的著作和党的各项政策方针，学习毛泽东思想，紧紧地向机关党组织靠拢，接受党的教育改造，真心诚意地成为党的驯服工具。虚心地向党员同志学习，诚恳地接受群众意见。
    我决心今后要紧紧握住毛泽东思想这面改造旧知识分子的胜利红旗，要在党的严格教育下，群众的督促下，用毛泽东思想认真地改造自己，充实自己，提高自己，使我在祖国的社会主义建设和共产主义建设中贡献出我的一切！
    这个发言有不妥之处，请代表同志们批评指正！
    敬祝各位代表身体健康！
