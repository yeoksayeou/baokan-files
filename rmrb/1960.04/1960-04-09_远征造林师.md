A Note from the Party Secretary

    The Expeditionary Afforestation Team
    Wang Chengwang, First Secretary of the CPC Zibo Prefectural Committee, Shandong
    In the Bohai Bay, at the mouth of the Yellow River, there is an island that people used to call "Lonely Island." This place was originally barren, but now this island is no longer "lonely" at all, and will soon be transformed from a barren island into an oasis. Recently, 15,000 young people from various counties and cities in Zibo Prefecture, forming the "Expeditionary Afforestation Team," are reclaiming land and planting trees here; the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League has also mobilized 3,000 young people from all over the province to settle down on this barren island, responsible for managing the large area of forest created by the shock afforestation team. This place has become a "miniature" of Shandong Province. Listen! The local accent, the Jiaodong accent, the central and southern Shandong accent, the northwestern and southwestern Shandong accent – all the accents from all over the province can be heard. If you take a walk around, you will see Boxing County and Zouping County, Leling County and Linyi County, are engaged in pairing competitions; there, Zhanhua County and Kenli County, Huimin County and Wudi County are organizing contests... All the counties in the prefecture have organized youth afforestation groups, and the youth from all the counties in the province have their representatives here. Wherever the young people go, that place boils with enthusiasm. Red flags are waving everywhere, loud songs are everywhere, and joyful labor is everywhere.
    Indeed! This island has about 900,000 mu of usable land, and it is planned to afforest 400,000 mu of land. Since they arrived on the island on February 8th, by March 12th, they had already removed tree roots and thorny shrubs, cleared reeds and weeds on 215,000 mu of land, preparing the conditions for afforestation, and cultivated more than 7,000 mu of seedlings, planting 10,000 mu of saplings. They built their own sheds because they had no housing, and repaired their own tools when they broke.
    "Transforming the barren island into an oasis" is not their entire plan. Afforestation of Lonely Island is only part of the plan to green the Bohai Bay area of Zibo Prefecture. From Wudi County in the north to Guangrao County in the south, it is planned to reclaim and afforest 1.2 million mu of coastal land, establishing three forest farms to manage these forests. Since a forest farm was established on Lonely Island in 1952, the new forest work has started here first. These three forest farms are planned to be equipped with machinery, and they will focus on forest management, carrying out comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. This afforestation task is planned to be completed in three years. After the entire task is completed, the Bohai Forest Area will become a timber base for Shandong Province.
    The entire afforestation task is undertaken by young people. But afforestation is only part of the entire plan to develop the Bohai Bay area of Zibo Prefecture. There is a large amount of land here that can be developed and utilized. In addition to building a salt farm and planning afforestation, it is also planned to use the coastal gullies to build fish and shrimp farms. Most of these farms will also be completed within the year. A new farm built on the east coast of Guangrao County can utilize seawater at high tide and also the Yellow River fresh water that has been used to irrigate fields from the Dayuzhang irrigation canal. There are now 5,000 people working there, and soon 70,000 mu will be put into production. The remaining reclaimed land will be used to meet the needs of more than twenty farms and several livestock farms. After this land is fully utilized, it will become a base for the large-scale production of agricultural products, livestock products, aquatic products, and sideline products, as well as a timber base and a light industrial base.
    Talking about these beautiful prospects cannot help but bring to mind the bitter past. This place was originally a plain formed by reclaimed land from the sea and alluvial deposits from the Yellow River. The Yellow River eroded the loess plateau of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, and stagnated and accumulated here, allowing the sea to recede. Over the years, the sea became farmland, but in the old society, this was all disaster. Due to soil erosion, the land on the Loess Plateau became barren from being fertile. Although the land here is vast and fertile, large areas of land are barren and gradually becoming alkaline. Some residents who could not bear the exploitation, oppression, and devastation fled here and spent many difficult years. There is a ditty that describes the living conditions of that time: "Walking on wide roads (because large areas of land were barren and alkaline, and there were few people, there were no fixed roads), hearing the call of the wheat lark (a small bird), eating yellow alfalfa (a wild plant), drinking cattle and horse urine (there was no fresh water, and seawater could not be drunk, so the rainwater stored in the depressions was shared by people and animals, which was not only dirty but also bitter)."
    During the years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, this place became an old revolutionary base area. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people stood up and, together with the people of the whole country, overthrew aggression, exploitation, and oppression. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, they organized themselves, reclaimed land, and built water conservancy projects, turning part of the barren land into farmland. People drank the sweet water of the Yellow River and already felt very good. Now the state has made such a large development plan, and people are pouring in from all directions, cars are coming and going, and huge tractors and tree planting machines have also arrived. Seeing that this barren and infertile land is about to change its appearance, how can people not be extremely happy? New hymns are sung: "Walking on the broad socialist road, hearing the calls of tractors and cars, drinking the sweet water of the Yellow River and all kinds of fine wine, eating white flour, vegetables, fruits, and fragrant rice (in the past, no vegetables or fruit trees grew here)."
    The youth have already opened the prelude to the great battle of Bohai Bay, and their actions will become a model for the development army!

    远征造林师
    中共山东淄博地委第一书记　王成旺
    在渤海湾，黄河入口的地方，有一个岛，过去人们把它叫做“孤岛”。这里本来是一片荒凉，但是，这个岛现在一点也不“孤”了，并且很快就会由荒岛变成绿洲。最近，从淄博专区各个县、市来了一万五千名青年组成的“远征造林师”，正在这里开荒种树；共青团山东省委，又从全省各县动员来三千名青年，到这荒岛上来安家落户，他们是负责管理突击造林师造起来的这大片森林的。这里成了山东省的“缩影”。你听吧！本地的口音，胶东的口音，鲁中南的口音，鲁西北和鲁西南的口音，全省各地的口音都有了。你要是去走上一转就会看见，这里有博兴县和邹平县、乐陵县和临邑县在搞对口赛；那里有沾化县和垦利县、惠民县和无棣县在组织竞赛……。全专区各县都组织了青年造林团，全省各县的青年也都有他们的代表在这里。青年们走到那里，那里就沸腾起来了。到处是红旗招展，到处有嘹亮的歌声，到处在欢乐地劳动。
    可不是么！这个岛大约有九十万亩可以利用的土地，计划用四十万亩土地造林。他们2月8日上岛以来，到3月12日已经在二十一万五千亩土地上拔掉了树根和荆芥，扫除了芦苇和野草，给造林准备了条件，并且培育了七千多亩树苗，栽下了一万亩树秧。他们没有住处就自己搭棚子，工具坏了自己修理。
    “要把荒岛变绿洲”，并不是他们的全部计划。孤岛造林只是绿化淄博专区渤海湾计划的一个部分。北起无棣县南至广饶县，计划在沿海开荒造林一百二十万亩，设立三个林场来经营这些森林，因为孤岛在1952年就设了一个林场，所以新造森林的工作，就先从这里开始了。这三个林场准备用机械装备起来，他们将以管理森林为主，进行农林牧副渔的全面开发。这个造林任务，计划三年完成。全部任务完成后，渤海林区将成为山东省的一个木材基地。
    全部造林任务，是由青年担负的。但是造林只是整个开发淄博专区渤海湾计划的一部分。这里有大片土地可以开发利用，除已在建设一个盐场和计划造林之外，还计划利用沿海的沟岔，建设鱼虾养殖场。这些养殖场多数也将在年内建成。在广饶县东海边新建的一个养殖场，可以利用上潮时的海水，也可以利用打渔张灌渠浇地后退下来的黄河甜水。现在有五千人在那里施工，不久就可以有七万亩投入生产。其余被开垦的土地，将用来满足二十几个农场和几个畜牧场的需要。这些土地被充分利用起来后，将是一个大量生产农产品、畜产品、水产品和副产品的基地，也是一个木材基地和轻工业基地。
    谈到这些美满的前程，不由得使人会想起辛酸的过去。这里原是一片退海地和黄河的冲积层所造成的平原。黄河冲刷了甘肃、陕西和山西的黄土高原，在这里停滞堆积起来让海水退位，积年累月地使沧海变成了桑田，但是在旧社会里，这都是灾害。黄土高原的土地由于水土流失，由肥沃而变成贫瘠。这里的土地虽然广阔肥沃，可是大片土地荒芜并且日渐碱化。受不了剥削、压迫和摧残逃来的一些居民，多年来在这里度着艰难的岁月。有这样一首顺口溜描写了当年生活的情景：“走的宽宽道（因大批土地荒芜碱化，人烟稀少，并没有一定的道路），听的麦蓝叫（是一种小鸟），吃的黄蓿菜（是一种野生植物），喝的牛马尿（没有甜水，海水又不能喝，只好把凹地储存的雨水，人畜共用，不仅肮脏而且味苦）。”
    在抗日战争和解放战争的年月里，这里成了老根据地。人们在共产党的领导下站起来了，和全国人民一道，推翻了侵略、剥削和压迫。解放后又在党的领导下，组织起来，开垦土地，兴修水利，使一部分荒地变成粮田，人们喝上了黄河的甜水，已经感到很不错了。现在国家又做出了这么大的开发规划，人们从四面八方涌来，汽车川流不息，庞大的拖拉机和植树机也来了。眼看这片荒凉的不毛之地就要变样，怎么能不使人万分高兴呢？新的赞歌唱起来了：“走的社会主义康庄大道，听的拖拉机和汽车呼叫，喝的黄河甜水各样美酒，吃的白面、蔬菜、水果、香稻（过去这里是不长家菜和水果树的）。”
    青年们已经揭开了大战渤海湾的序幕，他们的行动将成为开发大军的榜样！
