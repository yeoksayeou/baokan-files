　　Henan Mass Produces Cast Iron Pot-Type Power Units

　　Industrial departments in various parts of Henan Province are universally manufacturing cast iron pot-type power units. The province plans to manufacture 200,000 of these pot-type power units, totaling 700,000 horsepower, before the flood season, vigorously supporting agricultural technical transformation. This type of pot-type power unit has many advantages: the manufacturing technology is simple, and county and commune machinery factories capable of sand casting can manufacture it; materials are easy to obtain, with each cast iron pot-type power unit requiring only half a ton of pig iron; fuel is readily available, with coal, wood, sorghum stalks, etc., all suitable as fuel; work efficiency is high, allowing for continuous operation; it is easy to use, and can be operated by a semi-laborer; and it has a wide range of applications, capable of both pumping water for irrigation and serving as a power source for flour milling, power generation, and agricultural and sideline product processing.

　　Shanghai Rushes to Shandong to Vigorously Promote Coal Gasification

　　Recently, all fronts in Shanghai have been boosting their energy and momentum, rapidly pushing the mass movement of vigorously promoting coal gasification to a climax, striving for the high-speed realization of coal gasification. Many districts and bureaus have set specific combat goals, rushing to catch up with Shandong. Yangpu, Luwan, Nanshi, Xuhui and other districts, as well as the Light Industry Bureau system, are determined to learn from Shandong, catch up with Shandong, and surpass Shandong, striving to achieve coal gasification before "May Day." Other districts and bureaus will also fully achieve coal gasification in the shortest possible time.

　　Liaoning Builds More Than 1,000 Indigenous Coal Gas Furnaces in Half a Month

　　The ten major cities in Liaoning Province have recently built 1,663 indigenous coal gas furnaces in half a month, with another 1,114 under construction.

　　Liaoning Province has many industrial and mining enterprises, with very high coal consumption. In the past, the thermal energy of coal was not fully utilized, and many by-products from the coal were not recovered. To this end, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued a combat call to all workers in the province to achieve coal gasification. Industrial and mining enterprises, government agencies, shops, schools, and people's communes in cities such as Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, Jinzhou, and Dandong actively responded to the Provincial Committee's call and immediately launched a surge in the construction of coal gas furnaces.

From February to the end of March, a total of 12,800 people were saved and adjusted. Based on the principle of production first and general later, this mine transferred more than 6,700 people to strengthen the newly opened 44 pairs of small mine shafts, extracted 1,180 people to support suburban agricultural production; and more than 3,300 people participated in vigorously developing small-scale industries.

　　Go to the Countryside to Transplant Rice Seedlings

　　"Go to the countryside to transplant rice seedlings!" "Go all out to support our farmer brothers in doing a good job in summer harvest and planting!" These resounding slogans have become the actual actions of the vast number of workers, students, residents, stationed troops of the People's Liberation Army, and government cadres in the four cities of Changsha, Xiangtan, Hengyang, and Zhuzhou. At present, the rice transplanting army composed of 100,000 people from these four cities, after several days of technical training, has successively set out for the rice transplanting front.

　　Beijing-Kunming Route Flies Large Passenger Planes

　　The new "Ilyushin-18" turboprop large passenger plane successfully completed its first official flight on the Beijing-Kunming route on the 28th. The entire route, 2,166 kilometers, was only flown in four hours. The flight speed per hour is twice as fast as other passenger planes on this route. Passengers taking this plane to Kunming unanimously praised this new type of passenger plane as faster, more comfortable, and safer than ordinary passenger planes.

　　Shaanxi Cotton Planting Enters Final Stage

　　Cotton sowing in Shaanxi has entered the final stage. As of April 20, the province had planted more than 4 million mu of cotton, accounting for more than 94% of the pre-reserved stubble cotton fields. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to expand by another 50,000 mu on the basis of the original plan to expand the actual harvested area by 100,000 mu compared with last year. Now the province is carrying out a mass inspection and replanting movement to ensure the completion of the planting plan.

　　Spring Planting Enters Climax on Heilongjiang State Farms
