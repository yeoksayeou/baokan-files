    Vietnam’s “Study” Magazine Publishes Editorial Pointing Out that Imperialism's Belligerent Nature Has Not Changed; Peace Forces and Socialist Countries Should Strengthen Struggle

    (By this newspaper dispatch) Hanoi, March — The “Study” magazine, a political theory publication of the Vietnam Labor Party, published an editorial in its March issue, emphasizing the need to heighten vigilance against U.S. imperialism.

    While affirming the current easing of the international situation, the editorial emphasized: However, we must recognize that the reactionary and belligerent nature of imperialism has not changed; the general trend of the world situation is towards relaxation, but in some regions and some countries, the situation remains tense or even more tense. Some stubborn forces in imperialist countries are unwilling to abandon their war preparations. They dare not be as blatant as before, but their tone is still full of "Cold War" overtones. Due to domestic and world public opinion pressure and their deteriorating situation, their tactics have sometimes changed somewhat. They talk about peace and advocate disarmament, but in reality, this is a delaying tactic, attempting to buy time to strengthen their forces, desperately trying to catch up with the Soviet Union in the field of intercontinental rockets, attempting to regain lost advantages, using false pretenses to deceive public opinion, paralyze the vigilance of domestic masses and people of the world, and using relatively soft policies to get rid of political isolation. However, it is obvious that they are strengthening military alliances of all sizes, such as the North Atlantic Alliance, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Central Treaty Organization, and are also plotting to establish the Northeast Asia Group and the South Vietnam-Thailand-Laos Group. … Belligerent imperialists are plotting to restore and support the fascist revanchist forces of Germany and Japan, attempting to use this force as a commando team to provoke new wars. They are instigating Adenauer to undermine the solution of the German question. Recently, the United States concluded the so-called new "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" with Japan, which is a war plot that seriously threatens peace in Asia. We should also not forget that imperialism will not abandon its conspiracy to subvert socialist countries. They continue their policy of hostility towards China—a country that accounts for a quarter of the world’s population. U.S. imperialism and its lackeys continue to obstruct the unification of Vietnam and Korea, and have so far not accepted the reasonable proposals put forward by the Soviet government and the German Democratic Republic for resolving the German and West Berlin issues.

    The editorial said: "U.S. imperialism's conspiracy in Indochina is particularly dangerous. South Vietnam has become a U.S. military colony and military base. Laos is also falling into a similar situation. U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are doing everything possible to make the Kingdom of Cambodia abandon its policy of peace and neutrality and fall into the arms of the United States. The Ngo Dinh Diem regime’s inhumane policy of terror, sweeps, and killings proves the U.S.-Ngo clique’s determination to eliminate the patriotic forces in the South and those who support the unification of the motherland, attempting to divide Vietnam permanently and turn South Vietnam into a bridgehead and springboard for provoking war in Indochina."

    The editorial said: "Based on the above points, when we are happy about the easing of the situation and the development of the forces maintaining peace, we cannot be too optimistic and think that the imperialist jackals have become lambs, and that the warmongers have willingly tied their hands and feet and cannot do anything. We are excited and confident, but we must continue to heighten our vigilance and fight to consolidate world peace."

    The editorial said: "The current task of all peace forces and socialist countries is to pay attention to the conspiracies and actions of the imperialist warmongers, expose their evil conspiracies in a timely manner, strengthen unity, and strengthen the struggle against imperialism. We advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and social systems and peaceful competition in the economic field. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries have proposed comprehensive and thorough disarmament and resolving international disputes through negotiation. We advocate the development of economic and cultural relations between Eastern and Western countries. However, peaceful coexistence does not mean that we compromise with imperialism ideologically. No, we welcome any country, any government, group, faction, or individual in the capitalist world who can agree to peaceful coexistence, abandon the 'Cold War' policy, and further ease the international situation. But at the same time, we must fight against every conspiracy of the imperialist warmongers and their lackeys, and expose the tricks of the stubborn and hypocritical imperialist warmongers who play hide-and-seek with the cause of peace. We do not act recklessly or take risks, but we must never allow imperialist warmongers to use our sincerity to help them realize their conspiracies."

### 越南“学习”杂志发表社论指出  帝国主义好战本质并没有改变  和平力量和社会主义国家还应加强斗争

    越南“学习”杂志发表社论指出
    帝国主义好战本质并没有改变
    和平力量和社会主义国家还应加强斗争
    本报讯　越南劳动党政治理论刊物
  “学习”杂志3月号发表社论，强调必需对美帝国主义提高警惕。
    社论在肯定当前国际局势有所缓和的同时强调说：然而，我们必须认识到：帝国主义的反动和好战的本质并没有改变；世界总的形势是趋向缓和，但在某些地区和某些国家情况仍然紧张或更加紧张。帝国主义国家仍有一些顽固的势力不愿放弃备战计划，它们不敢再像以前那样明目张胆，但它们的语调仍充满“冷战”气味。由于国内和世界舆论的压力以及它们处境的每况愈下，它们的策略有时也作了某些改变，嘴说和平，赞成裁军，其实，这是它们的缓兵之计，企图争取时间加强力量，拼命在洲际火箭方面追赶苏联，企图挽回已经失去的优势，用假招牌来迷惑舆论，麻痹国内群众和世界人民的警觉性，用比较柔软的政策以摆脱政治上的孤立地位。但是，有目共睹，它们正在加强大大小小的军事联盟，如北大西洋联盟、东南亚集团、中央条约集团，还正在阴谋建立东北亚集团和南越—泰国—老挝集团。……好战的帝国主义分子正在阴谋恢复和扶植德国和日本的法西斯复仇力量，企图使用这个力量成为挑起新战争的突击队。它们唆使阿登纳破坏德国问题的解决，最近美国又与日本缔结了所谓新的“日美安全条约”，这是严重威胁亚洲和平的战争阴谋。我们还不应忘记，帝国主义不会放弃颠复社会主义国家的阴谋，它们继续敌视中国——一个占人类四分之一人口的国家——的政策，美帝国主义及其走狗继续阻挠越南、朝鲜的统一，迄今尚不接受苏联政府和德意志民主共和国所提出的解决德国以及西柏林问题的合情合理的建议。
    社论说：“美帝国主义对于印度支那的阴谋具有特别的危险性。南越已变成美国的军事殖民地和军事基地。老挝也正沦为相似的情况。美帝国主义及其走狗正在用尽一切办法想使柬埔寨王国放弃和平中立政策而倒向美国怀抱。吴庭艳政权惨无人道的恐怖、扫荡、杀戮政策，证明了美吴集团一意要消灭南方爱国力量和赞成统一祖国的人的野心，妄图长期分割越南，把南越变成在印度支那挑起战争的桥头堡和跳板。”
    社论说：“基于以上各点，所以当我们为局势的缓和以及维护和平的力量正在发展而高兴的时候，还不能过于乐观，以为帝国主义豺狼已变成绵羊了，好战分子已自甘绑住手脚不能有所作为了。兴奋、有信心，但仍要不断提高警觉性，为巩固世界和平而奋斗。”
    社论说：“一切和平力量和社会主义各国当前的任务是，必须注视着帝国主义好战分子的阴谋和行动，及时揭露它们的罪恶阴谋，加强团结，加强对帝国主义的斗争。我们主张政治、社会制度不同的各国间可以和平共处，并在经济方面进行和平竞赛。苏联和其他社会主义国家提议进行全面、彻底的裁军和协商的方法解决国际争端。我们主张发展东、西方各国间的经济和文化关系。但是，和平共处决不意味着我们在思想意识上向帝国主义妥协，不，我们欢迎资本主义世界的任何国家、任何政府、集团、派别和个人能够赞成和平共处、放弃‘冷战’政策、以进一步缓和国际局势，但是同时，我们必须为反对帝国主义好战分子及其走狗的每一个阴谋而斗争。揭露顽固、伪诈的帝国主义好战分子对于和平事业捉迷藏的手法。我们不蛮干、冒险，但我们决不能使帝国主义好战分子利用我们的真诚态度而助于实现它们的阴谋。”
