Party Committee Secretary's Notes

    Mao Zedong's Works Are a Beacon
    Li Shiwen, Secretary of the Zhengzhou No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill Committee of the Communist Party of China

    In the past two years, the workers' dormitories in our factory have undergone tremendous changes. Cleanliness and orderliness are, of course, a sign, but even more striking is the atmosphere in the dormitories. Every room is filled with the sound of reading aloud, the walls are covered with poems and paintings, and the tables are full of stacks of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." On the white walls, in addition to the bright red and green maxims and quotations, the learning gardens, framed by couplets such as "Study Chairman Mao's Works conscientiously and always be promoters of politics," are filled with learning experiences and essays. Everywhere you can hear people talking about their insights from studying Chairman Mao's works. Why are the workers so greedily studying Chairman Mao's works? They say that Chairman Mao's works are like miraculous medicines, promoting production to flourish. They sing praises:
    Mao Zedong's works are a treasure, indispensable for all work,
    After studying, thoughts fly the red flag, and production enthusiasm increases every day.

    Workers studying theory and Chairman Mao's works is the style of our era. The era when workers were treated like beasts of burden is over. With the deepening of class struggle on the political and ideological fronts and the demands of people in the struggle with nature, workers increasingly feel the need to study theory conscientiously to guide practical struggle. Facts have also proved that workers can not only learn theory, but also that once theory is grasped by the working masses, it generates tremendous material power. Through studying theory, everyone stands higher, sees farther, and establishes the great ambition to realize communism.

    Knowledge comes from practice. The workers understood this indestructible truth of historical materialism and were greatly inspired and encouraged, and put forward many ambitious slogans. "We must do what has been done before, and we must create what has never been done before." They broke through the ideological shackles of superstition towards books, foreigners, and engineering and technical personnel. Qiao Wenshan, a new worker who entered the factory in October 1958, broke the superstition that apprentices could not innovate. Since 1959, he has put forward a total of 155 innovation suggestions, realizing 41 major innovations, with work efficiency increasing by one to seventy times, completing three years and five months of tasks in one year of 1959. Theory thus generated infinite power in the practice of the workers.

    The development and movement of objective things never ends, and people's understanding of truth in practice never ends either. Technical revolution is also endless. Thinking that the technical revolution is almost done and there is nothing to innovate is to regard things as static and unchanging, which does not conform to the law of development of objective things. After achieving brilliant achievements in the technical revolution, the workers once again held high the red flag of continuous revolution, making the technical revolution appear in a continuous leap forward. In January of this year, the factory put forward a total of 21,709 rationalization proposals, accounting for 86% of the total number of rationalization proposals in the entire last year; in February, a total of 37,570 proposals were put forward, an increase of 73% compared with January. The adoption rate increased to 70%, and the number of people who put forward innovation suggestions accounted for more than 90% of the total number of employees in the factory.

    Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, while actively transforming the objective world, the workers also actively transform their subjective world, and the communist style is greatly promoted. The workers are clear that socialist construction is the collective undertaking of millions of people. It is not good for one person to be good, but it is spring when all flowers are blooming. Therefore, it has become a common practice to take on difficulties, give way to honors, learn from the advanced, and help the backward.

    Mao Zedong Thought shines with golden light. After studying, grassroots cadres who do not leave production said one after another: "There is more dialectics and less one-sidedness. The heart is brighter. With the enthusiasm to serve the people, coupled with good methods, things will surely be done well." Sha Weide, the production team leader of the preparation workshop, after studying, changed his original rigid, subjective and one-sided work style and conducted in-depth investigation and research in everything. Find the key, grasp the key, consult with the masses when something happens, understand the thoughts of backward team members, and help solve them specifically, so that the team's production quickly reached an advanced level. He happily sang praises:

    Mao Zedong's works are a beacon, illuminating the thoughts brightly,
    Relying on the masses to break the key, exceeding production and excellent quality to compete for the top spot.

### 毛主席著作是明灯

    毛主席著作是明灯
    中共郑州国棉三厂委员会书记　李世文
    这两年，我们厂工人宿舍里大变样。清洁整齐当然是一个标志，但更引人注目的是宿舍的气氛，各个房间里书声琅琅，诗画满墙，桌上摆满着一叠叠“毛泽东选集”。洁白的墙上，除红绿鲜艳的格言、语录外，在“认真学习毛主席著作，永做政治上的促进派”等一幅幅对联镶着的学习园地里，贴满了一篇篇学习心得和论文，到处都可以听到人们谈论学习毛主席著作的心得。工人为啥这样贪婪的学习着毛主席著作？他们说，毛主席著作像仙丹妙药，促使生产蒸蒸日上。他们歌颂说：
    毛主席著作是个宝，一切工作离不了，
    学后思想插红旗，生产干劲日日高。
    工人学习理论、学习毛主席著作，是我们时代的风格，工人当牛当马的时代过去了。随着政治、思想战线上阶级斗争的深入和人们在与自然斗争中的要求，工人越来越感到必须认真学习理论，以理论来指导实践斗争。事实也这样证明，工人不但能学理论，而且理论一旦为工人群众所掌握，就产生了巨大的物质力量。通过学习理论，大家站的更高、看的更远，树立了实现共产主义的雄心大志。
    认识来源于实践。工人明白了这条历史唯物辩证的颠仆不破的真理，得到了极大启发和鼓舞，提出了许多豪迈的口号。“前所已有的我们要做到，前所未有的我们要创造。”冲破了迷信书本、迷信洋人、迷信工程技术人员的思想枷锁。1958年10月进厂的新工乔文山，打破了徒工不能革新的迷信，在1959年以来共提出革新建议一百五十五条，实现重大革新四十一项，工效分别提高一至七十倍，以1959年一年的时间，完成了三年零五个月的任务。理论就这样的在工人实践中产生了无穷的力量。
    客观事物的发展运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对真理的认识也就永远没有完结，技术革命也是永无止境的。认为技术革命搞的差不多、没有什么革头了，这都是把事物看成是静止的、不变的，是不符合客观事物发展规律的。在技术革命获得辉煌成就之后，工人又高举不断革命的红旗，使技术革新技术革命出现了持续跃进的洪峰。今年1月全厂共提合理化建议两万一千七百零九条，占去年全年合理化建议总数的86％；2月份共提三万七千五百七十条，比1月份又增长73％。采纳率提高到70％，提革新建议人数占全厂职工总人数90％以上。
    工人在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，积极改造客观世界的同时，也积极改造自己的主观世界，共产主义风格大大发扬。工人们明确了社会主义建设是千百万人的集体事业。一个人好不算好，万紫千红才是春。因此见困难就上、见荣誉就让、见先进就学、见后进就帮，已经相习成风。
    毛泽东思想闪金光。不脱产的基层干部学习后纷纷说：“多了些辩证法，少了些片面性。心里亮堂了。有了为人民服务的热心，再加上好方法，事情准能办好。”准备车间生产组长沙威德经过学习改变了原来态度生硬、主观片面的工作作风，事事深入进行深入调查研究。找关键、抓关键，有事和群众商量，了解后进组员思想，具体帮助解决，使小组生产迅速跨上先进水平。他兴高采烈地歌颂道：
    毛主席著作是明灯，照的思想亮晶晶，
    依靠群众破关键，超产优质争头名。
