Representative Xia Yikun speaks on black metallurgy design work:

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the various reports made by the leaders and chiefs at this conference, and I suggest that the conference adopt them.

1959 was an extraordinary year, a year of continuing the comprehensive Great Leap Forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward of 1958. The organization of the people's communes continued to develop and consolidate. In the face of unprecedentedly severe natural disasters across the country, it mobilized all positive factors of the people and exerted unparalleled power and superiority, overcoming the extraordinary drought that had not been seen for decades and achieving a bumper harvest. This miracle is unprecedented and powerfully refutes the malicious slanders of the imperialists against the people's communes and the Great Leap Forward. In the industrial field, the progress was equally rapid. In 1959, China's steel production reached 13.35 million tons, an increase of more than 5 million tons compared to 1958, exceeding the production target of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. The same is true in other areas. Such high-speed and extraordinary leaps forward are cause for great joy, playing a decisive role in improving the lives of the working people and making outstanding contributions to the cause of world peace.

At the beginning of 1960, the national industry and agriculture achieved a flying start. Under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are full of confidence and determined to seize three reds and five bumper harvests. On the basis of the victories of the two Great Leap Forwards in 1958 and 1959, we will continue to move forward by leaps and bounds, catching up with and surpassing Britain in the output of major industrial products in less than ten years. At that time, China's backwardness of being "poor and blank" will be completely changed, and manual, heavy physical labor will be completely eliminated, replaced by mechanization, electrification, and automation.

On the road of high-speed advance, many difficulties will inevitably arise, but we must not retreat in the face of difficulties like right-leaning opportunists. We must adhere to holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously revolutionize, overcome all difficulties, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, launch a great technological revolution and technological innovation, and strive to victoriously complete the great socialist construction cause of the motherland, and continue to move forward courageously towards the beautiful vision of a communist society.

In the work of capital construction, design work has always been a weak link, mostly done by hand. It has always been thought that mental labor cannot be mechanized and automated. However, in recent months, design institutes across the country have responded to the call of the Party and launched a vigorous mass movement to advance towards mechanization, electrification, and automation, creating a new era-making situation. The elimination of tracing work will soon be fully realized, liberating a lot of heavy labor. At the same time, the factory prefabrication of designs, the data graphing of information, the computerization of mechanical and electrical engineering, and the complete coordination of various designs have been realized, increasing efficiency by several times, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times. Moreover, according to the needs of the work, forces are often concentrated to carry out annihilation warfare. In this way, the design institution, as the pioneer of capital construction, has changed the previous passive situation and can deliver design drawings of excellent quality on time and ahead of schedule, enabling the construction industry to leap forward at an even higher speed. At the same time, designers can free up more time to carry out scientific and technological research, so that design quality can be further improved, achieving originality and major inventions, and fiercely attacking the cutting edge and climbing the peak, so that China's scientific and technological level can reach the world's most advanced ranks.

Our Wuhan Black Metallurgy Design Institute, like other design institutes across the country, under the encouragement of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, vigorously opposed right-leaning tendencies, mustered greater energy, and completed all tasks one month ahead of schedule in 1959, ensuring the rapid construction of seven provinces and the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation and the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Corporation. In order to ensure that the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation produced steel on "October 1st," our institute sent a large number of designers to the site to cooperate with the construction units and the worker comrades to work together under the scorching sun, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner, achieving a combination of theory and practice. At the same time, through labor, the ideological style was greatly changed, and the work enthusiasm was even higher, timely supplying and modifying the design drawings, so that the construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's open-hearth steelmaking plant achieved a new record of amazing speed. We cannot be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. Now, the construction speed of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace of Baotou Steel has exceeded that of Wuhan Iron and Steel. This communist style of learning, comparing, catching up, helping, and collaborating is the main driving force of the Great Leap Forward, enabling the backward to catch up with and surpass the advanced, and the advanced to become even more advanced, improving together, promoting each other, and working together to fly rapidly towards the lofty goal of communism. In recent months, our institute has launched a mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement, advancing towards mechanization and automation. Up to now, the computer manufacturing team headed by Comrade Liu Youfu, the red banner bearer of our institute, has worked hard for three days and nights and finally manufactured a three-layer, three-span electrical ratio computer under difficult material conditions, increasing efficiency by 60 times. We are now continuing to study and expand the scope of application, hoping to transform it into a complete universal computer. Other innovation projects number more than 1,000, making design work even faster. In addition, more than 100 scientific and technological research projects will be carried out this year. These will provide accurate and reliable data for our future design work, so that design work can be more closely integrated with reality. However, we believe that the work we have done in the past is far from enough. We should strive to learn from the advanced experiences of fraternal design institutes, improve design level and design speed, and establish a black metallurgy design institute to cultivate new forces, establish lofty ambitions, and be an invincible vanguard in the national socialist construction cause.

In the process of high-speed construction of China's iron and steel industry, I think the following tasks should also be done well. Please criticize and correct whether they are appropriate.

First, accelerate resource exploration. China's iron and steel smelting resources are widely distributed and rich in reserves, but most of them are located in areas with inconvenient transportation and insufficient manpower and equipment. The progress of exploration work is far from keeping up with the needs of the country's high-speed leap forward in construction. In the future, we should strengthen the forces in this area and create good conditions for it in terms of transportation, equipment, etc., to promote the high-speed progress of exploration work.

Second, the research and testing of the method of direct reduction of iron ore and other raw materials in rotary kilns and directly sending them to electric furnaces for steelmaking. In areas with abundant hydropower and a shortage of coal, this direct steelmaking method can be used to produce electric furnace steel more cheaply, and iron ores containing rare elements such as chromium and titanium can be reasonably smelted and recovered. Equipment investment can be reduced, construction period can be accelerated, and there is no need to build heavy coke ovens and blast furnaces. There are many benefits, and the significance is even greater in areas with abundant hydropower in our country. But now they are all limited to small-scale equipment, so it is necessary to concentrate appropriate forces to engage in the testing and research of this direct steelmaking method.

Third, the testing and research of steelmaking from high-phosphorus iron in top-blown pure oxygen converters. Now foreign countries have tested the smelting of pig iron containing up to 1.5% phosphorus in pure oxygen top-blown converters, but there are no satisfactory results for the smelting of pig iron with higher phosphorus content, and it is not economically worthwhile. However, if this test is successful, it will be a great way out for a large number of high-phosphorus iron ores in our country, which is of great significance. Therefore, it is very necessary to carry out this industrial test in large iron and steel plants in our country.

Fourth, improve the production capacity of coke ovens. The potential of coke ovens is very great and should be greatly tapped. In the current production of iron and steel plants, the output of blast furnaces has increased very rapidly, and the furnace capacity coefficient of large blast furnaces can be increased to more than three, which is entirely possible, but the increase in the output of coke ovens is still not much. This causes great difficulties in the layout of iron and steel plants, because coke ovens occupy a very large area and cannot adapt to the blast furnace area. In addition to trying to use coal preheating and tamping methods to increase output, the study of increasing the capacity of the furnace should also be carried out to meet the needs of increased production in iron and steel plants.

Fifth, the use of pelletized sinter. The working conditions in sintering plants are very poor, with a lot of dust. Due to the limitation of the cooling pan capacity, it is necessary to transport the hot sinter in vehicles and pour it into the ore storage tank, which further deteriorates the working conditions and reduces the equipment life accordingly. On the other hand, the working conditions in the pelletized sinter workshop are better, the dust is reduced a lot, the construction investment is also reduced a lot, and the quality of the sinter is also improved. Therefore, in order to simplify the transportation of iron and steel plants, improve labor conditions, and reduce capital construction investment, it seems that the adoption of pelletized sinter should be promoted.

Sixth, in the design work of new iron and steel plants, the factor of increased production should be considered. In the two years of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, the potential of the old equipment in iron and steel plants was tapped a lot, some of which doubled several times. In the future, there will still be great potential, which is extremely beneficial to the high-speed construction of socialism. However, the potential of the equipment is often limited by the factory area and transportation conditions. Therefore, in the design of new plants, we should see the prospects for increased production of equipment, consider them in detail, and not limit them. Only in this way can we meet the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Seventh, small-scale blast furnace groups should consider mechanization and automation as much as possible. After the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, the labor force is generally felt to be insufficient. In the past, the transportation of iron ore, coking coal, etc. in small iron and steel plants was mostly done manually, with high labor intensity and poor working conditions, which can no longer meet the requirements of the current high-speed industrialization. Therefore, mechanization and automation should be considered as much as possible within the possible scope to save labor. However, it should be closely combined with savings. In areas where conditions are not available, we should consider using indigenous methods first and then gradually carry out technological transformation to achieve the goal of mechanization and automation.

Eighth, timely summarize and promote the advanced experience in iron and steel production during the Great Leap Forward. Since the Great Leap Forward, our country has created a lot of advanced experience in the iron and steel industry, such as the continuous improvement of the blast furnace capacity utilization coefficient and new technologies such as hot-air converter steelmaking. Some have brought about major revolutions in the principles of iron and steel smelting. They should be summarized and sorted out in a timely manner and find new explanations in theory to promote and improve them rapidly and play a promoting role in the continued extraordinary leap forward.

In 1960, China's iron and steel production and capital construction tasks are heavy, but as long as we listen to the Party's words everywhere, we will be able to overcome various difficulties and overfulfill this glorious task.

Finally, I wish the conference a success and all representatives good health.

    设计闹革命　天地广阔
    设计工作机械化、电气化、自动化以后，出现了一个崭新局面；从此，这个基本建设的先行官，完全可以从赶不上施工需要的被动局面转为主动了。
    夏以焜代表谈黑色冶金设计工作主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护各位领导和首长在这次大会上所作的各项报告，建议大会予以通过。
    1959年是一个不平凡的一年，是在1958年大跃进的基础上继续全面大跃进的一年。人民公社的组织继续发展和巩固，在全国空前严重的自然灾害的情况下，调动了全国人民的一切积极因素，发挥了无比的威力和优越性，战胜了数十年来从未有过的特大旱灾，获得了大丰收。这种奇迹，是史无前例的，这完全有力地驳斥了帝国主义者对人民公社和大跃进的恶毒污蔑。在工业方面，同样是一日千里，1959年我国的钢产量已经达到了一千三百三十五万吨，跟1958年比较，增加了五百多万吨，提前三年超额地完成了第二个五年计划的产量指标。其他方面也是一样。这样高速度的特大跃进，是值得我们欢欣鼓舞的，对劳动人民生活的提高，起了决定性的作用，对世界和平事业，有着卓越的贡献。
    1960年一开始，全国工农业就获得了开门红，在党中央和毛主席的英明正确领导下，全国人民正满怀信心，誓夺三红五丰收，要在1958和1959两年大跃进的胜利基础上，继续大踏步地前进，要在不到十年的时间内，在主要工业产品产量方面，赶上和超过英国。那时候我国“一穷二白”的落后面貌，将全部改观，手工笨重体力劳动，将完全消灭，代之以机械化、电气化和自动化。
    在高速度前进的道路上，也一定会出现许多困难，但我们不能像右倾机会主义分子那样，患难而退，我们要坚持高举毛泽东思想红旗，不断革命，克服一切困难，敢想敢说敢干，大闹技术革命和技术革新，为胜利地完成伟大的祖国社会主义建设事业、为继续向共产主义社会的美好远景，奋勇前进。
    在基本建设的工作中，设计工作一向是一个薄弱环节，多数是手工操作，一向认为脑力劳动是无法机械化和自动化的。但近几个月来，全国各个设计院，都响应党的号召，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动，向机械化、电气化和自动化进军，出现了一个划时代的崭新局面，描图工作的消灭，即将全部实现，解放了不少的繁重劳动，同时实现设计的工厂拼装化、资料图表化、计算机械化电气化以及各项设计的成龙配套，工效提高了数倍、数十倍以至数百倍，并时常根据工作的需要，集中兵力进行歼灭战。这样，作为基本建设先行官的设计机构，改变了以往被动的局面，可以按时和提前交付质量优良的设计图纸，使建设事业有条件以更高的速度飞跃推动，同时设计工作者能腾出更多的时间来进行科学技术研究工作，使设计质量更能提高，达到独创和重大发明，并猛攻尖端，攀高峰，使我国科学技术水平，达到世界最先进的行列。
    我们武汉黑色冶金设计院也和全国其他设计院一样，在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，大反右倾，鼓足更大的干劲，在1959年提前一个月完成了全部任务，保证了七个省和武钢马钢的快速施工。为了确保武钢“十一”出钢，我院曾派出了大批设计人员到达现场，配合施工单位，和工人同志们在酷热的阳光下一道劳动，发现问题，及时解决，达到理论和实际相结合，同时通过劳动大大地改变了思想作风，工作情绪更加高涨，及时地供应和修改了设计图纸，使武钢平炉炼钢厂的建设得到惊人高速度的新纪录。我们不能满足于已有成绩，现在包钢第一号平炉建设速度，已经超过了武钢，这种学、比、赶、帮和大协作的共产主义风格，是大跃进的主要动力，使后进的赶上和超过先进，先进的更先进，共同提高，互相促进，同心协力，向共产主义的崇高目标，飞速前进。最近几个月以来，我院掀起了一个群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，向机械化自动化进军，到目前为止，以我院红旗手刘有福同志为首的计算机制造小组，苦干了三昼夜，终于在材料困难的情况下制成了一台三层三跨电比计算机，提高工效六十倍，现正继续钻研，推广应用范围，希望改造成为一台完整的万能计算机。其他革新项目约计在一千件以上，使设计工作更能高速进行。此外在本年度内将进行一百余项科学技术研究工作。这些都将对我们今后设计工作提供确切可靠的资料，使设计工作更能和实际密切结合。但我们认为我们过去所做的工作是很不够的，应当努力学习各兄弟设计院的先进经验，提高设计水平和设计速度，并建立黑色冶金设计学院，培养新生力量，树雄心，立大志，要在国家社会主义建设事业中做一个所向无敌的尖兵。
    在高速度进行我国钢铁工业建设的过程中，我认为目前还应当做好下列几项工作，是否恰当，请代表们予以批评指正。
    一、加速资源的勘探工作。我国钢铁冶炼资源，分布极广，藏量丰富，但大部分由于交通不便，人力和设备不足，勘探工作的进度，还远远不能跟上国家建设高速度跃进的需要，今后应加强这方面的力量，并在交通运输和设备等方面，为其创造良好条件，促进勘探工作的高速度进行。
    二、由铁矿等原料在转窑内还原直接送入电炉炼钢法的研究和试验。在水电丰富和缺煤的地区，可以用这种直接炼钢法比较便宜地炼制出电炉钢，并可把含有铬钛等稀有元素的铁矿很合理地熔炼和回收。设备投资，均可减少，建设工期可加快，可以不建笨重的焦炉和高炉，好处很多，在我国水电丰富的地区，意义更大。但现在还都限于小型的设备，因此需要集中适当力量，从事这种直接炼钢法的试验和研究。
    三、在顶吹纯氧转炉内进行高磷铁炼钢的试验和研究。现在国外已经试验含磷达1.5％的生铁在纯氧顶吹转炉中冶炼，但对更高含磷生铁的冶炼，尚无圆满的结果，在经济上亦不合算，但该项试验如能成功，则对我国大量的高磷铁矿，将是一个很大的出路，意义极为重大，所以在我国大型钢铁厂进行该项工业试验是十分必要的。
    四、提高炼焦炉的生产能力。炼焦炉的潜力极大，应大大加以挖掘，现在钢铁厂的生产中，高炉的产量提高很快，大型高炉的炉容系数提高到三以上，是完全可能的，而焦炉产量的提高还是不多，这样在钢铁厂的布置中，感到极大困难，因焦炉所占位置极大，不能与高炉区互相适应，除设法采用煤炭预热和捣紧等办法以增高产量外，还应研究加大炉子容量，以满足钢铁厂增产的需要。
    五、球烧结矿的采用。烧结厂的劳动条件很差，灰尘很多，并由于冷却盘能力的限制，必须用车辆运输炽热的烧结矿倒入储矿槽，劳动条件更形恶化，设备寿命，相应降低，在另一方面球烧结矿车间，劳动条件较好，灰尘减少很多，建设投资也降低很多，烧结矿质量也有所提高，所以为了钢铁厂运输的简化，劳动条件的改善以及基建投资的降低，似应提倡推广球烧结矿的采用。
    六、在进行新建钢铁厂的设计工作中，应考虑增产的因素。在1958、1959两年全面大跃进中，钢铁厂旧有设备的潜力，挖掘很多，有的翻了几番，今后仍将有很大潜力，这对高速度建设社会主义极为有利，但设备潜力的发挥，往往为厂地面积和运输条件所限制，所以在新厂设计中，应看到设备增产的前途，详细考虑，不要加以限制，这样才能符合多快好省总路线的建设方针。
    七、小洋群要尽量考虑机械化和自动化。在1958和1959两年全面大跃进以后，劳动力普遍感到不足，以往小型钢铁厂内关于铁矿焦煤等运输，大部由人工操作，劳动强度高，劳动条件差，已经不能适应现在高速度工业化的要求，所以在可能范围内应尽量考虑机械化和自动化，以节约劳动力，但应与节约密切结合。在条件不具备的地区，应考虑土法上马，以后逐步地进行技术改造，达到机械化和自动化的目的。
    八、及时总结和推广在大跃进中关于钢铁生产的先进经验。大跃进以来，我国在钢铁工业方面创造了很多先进经验，如高炉炉容利用系数的不断提高和热风转炉炼钢等新技术，有的在钢铁冶炼原理方面发生了大的革命，应及时地加以总结和整理，并在理论方面找出新的解说，以便迅速推广和提高，在继续特大跃进中起到促进作用。
    1960年我国的钢铁生产和基建任务是繁重的，但我们只要处处听党的话，一定能够克服种种困难超额地完成这个光荣任务。
    最后祝大会成功，各位代表身体健康。
