Chairman, fellow committee members:

Having listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1960 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1959 National Financial Statement and the 1960 National Budget, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the work of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee, I wholeheartedly endorse them and am willing to resolutely implement them.

Through the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, our people have achieved the main targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. This rapid pace of development and unprecedented construction achievements are very inspiring. The Chinese people are jubilant about this, and peace-loving people all over the world are also applauding. The year 1959 will be recorded in the history of the revolution as a sign of China's socialist construction entering a new stage, and will forever radiate brilliant light.

China has completed a five-year journey in two years. This fact itself irrefutably proves that the socialist system has unparalleled superiority. This is a victory for the general line of socialist construction, a victory for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

With the deepening of socialist revolution and socialist construction, we have not only greatly strengthened our material foundation, but also undergone profound changes in our people's mental outlook. Personally, through the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, my bourgeois individualism and purely technical viewpoints have been overcome to some extent, and the issue of science and technology serving politics has also become clear. At the same time, it has made me deeply realize that I must always be of one heart with the Party and take the socialist road. No matter what work I do, I must adhere to putting politics in command. However, the questions of how I should serve and how I can serve well have not been thoroughly resolved. After studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, I realized that the reason why the above problems have not been well resolved is mainly because ideological remolding is not yet sufficient, bourgeois ideas have not been completely eliminated, and a proletarian revolutionary outlook on life has not been well established. Therefore, ideologically, I cannot keep up with the development of the objective situation. For example, when the Party put forward the exciting great call to catch up with Britain, and when the industrial front put forward the slogan of combining indigenous and foreign methods, I, like other comrades, was very excited. But in my heart, I thought that British industry is very developed in capitalist countries, and if China wants to catch up, it can only do so by running larger-scale industries with newer technologies, so as to shorten the time and strive for speed. I felt that developing small, indigenous methods would not play a significant role. During the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking, I lacked confidence in promoting the use of earthenware pots for iron smelting, believing that it was something that had long been eliminated, resulting in high waste and low quality, and that it would not be useful to complete the task using this method. At that time, I did not think at all that the growth process of everything is a development process from low to high, from simple to complex, and I did not understand that indigenous methods can lead to foreign methods, small things can lead to big things, and small indigenous groups can develop into small foreign groups and even large foreign groups. The fact is also true, small indigenous groups smelted a large amount of iron, exerting great power, and on the basis of small indigenous groups, many modern smelting bases grew up, greatly strengthening the ranks of China's steel front and enhancing the production capacity of the steel industry. All of this shows that my original ideas were divorced from reality and my vision was short-sighted. For example, in science and technology work, I used to think that to carry out scientific research, it is necessary to have good equipment and instruments, rich data, and senior engineering and technical personnel, especially for research on cutting-edge science, which is indispensable. Based on these views, I felt that the Party's call for the whole people to engage in science was just to encourage young people and inspire older people. I believed that young technicians and workers and peasants had little knowledge, low culture, and not much experience. At most, they could only do some general technical reforms and change operations. Now it seems that this is essentially an erroneous view that denies the mass movement in scientific research work. The reason for forming this erroneous view is mainly because I lack a deep understanding of the far-reaching significance of only by carrying out mass movements in China's scientific work can it develop in a faster, better, and more economical way, and catch up with the world's advanced level in a relatively short period of time. I do not understand that relying on a few people to do scientific research will inevitably lead to a cold and deserted situation, being slow, poor, and costly, which is contrary to the spirit of the general line. Facts speak louder than words. The vast number of young technicians and workers and peasants, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, not only carried out general technical reforms, but also conquered cutting-edge technologies at an unprecedented speed and created one miracle after another. Today, it seems that the reason why my understanding was wrong is that I did not closely combine scientific research with production practice. Although I verbally admitted that the wisdom and strength of the workers and peasants are infinite and great, in specific problems, I still despise the workers and peasants, which is essentially a manifestation of a bourgeois scientific research attitude. Natural science is a summary of production practice and serves production. The workers and peasants are direct participants in production, and factories and farmland are also good laboratories and research bases. Only by linking production and conducting scientific and technological research around the key points of production can significant achievements be made. In recent years, most of the inventions and creations in science and technology have come from the hands of young technicians and workers and peasants. This is mainly because they have liberated their minds, broken superstitions, and have the communist style of daring to think and act. With this style, they want to do what others have done, and they dare to create what others have not done. I have seen many such lively innovators. From them, I saw two most valuable things. First, they can listen to the Party, have a red heart and firm determination, and have infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause, with full enthusiasm and vigorous revolutionary spirit. Second, in scientific research, they insisted on implementing the principle of coming from practice and returning to practice, and closely combined scientific research with production practice. Through these facts, I deeply realized that in the scientific cause, it is necessary to adhere to the policy of walking on two legs, combining scientific research with production practice, combining professional scientific research institutions with the mass movement of scientific work, and combining senior engineering and technical personnel with young technicians and the vast number of workers and peasants. For the older generation of scientific and technical personnel, it is even more necessary to learn from the young technicians and workers and peasants the fearless spirit of not fearing the sky, not fearing the earth, daring to innovate, and daring to create. Only in this way can they truly contribute to the socialist cause. Otherwise, clinging to old ideas, always believing in foreign things, believing in ancient things, and believing in authority will lead to nothing.

In the past, I learned some knowledge and was considered an intellectual. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, although I have also done some work, compared with the care and consideration given to me by the Party and the government, my contribution to the people is still very small, and I feel very ashamed. Why haven't I contributed much? The most important thing is that I have not completely armed myself with the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method, nor have I been liberated from the theoretical cabinet of old books. I have not insisted on putting politics in command enough, and my thinking has not really turned red.

In the work practice of the past ten years, I have deeply realized that the Party is very concerned about and loves the older generation of intellectuals. I will never fail the Party's expectations of me. In the future, I must earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, integrate theory with practice, remold my thinking, and in practical work, I must further boost my revolutionary spirit, overcome dependence, delve deeply, and strive to better complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the people in my post, and through theoretical study and business practice and social practice, continuously improve my political awareness, change my position, thoroughly transform non-proletarian ideas, firmly establish a proletarian world view, and strive to become a member of the working class as soon as possible. Intellectuals, serve socialism more brilliantly.

Finally, I wish the conference a complete success.

I wish all members good health.

### 知识分子必须加强思想改造  曹焕文委员的发言

    知识分子必须加强思想改造
    曹焕文委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    听了李富春副总理关于1960年国民经济计划的报告，李先念副总理关于1959年国家决算和1960年国家预算的报告和陈叔通副主席关于全国政协常务委员会工作报告，我衷心拥护，并愿坚决贯彻执行。
    经过1958年和1959年连续大跃进，我国人民提前三年实现了第二个五年计划所规定的主要指标。这种一日千里的发展速度和史无前例的建设成就，都是非常振奋人心的。对此，我国人民为之欢欣鼓舞，全世界爱好和平的人民亦为之额手称快。1959年将作为我国社会主义建设进入新阶段的标志载入革命史册，永远放射着灿烂的光辉。
    我国用两年的时间走完了五年的道路。这个事实本身就无可辩驳地证明了社会主义制度具有无比的优越性。这是社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是中国共产党领导的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的深入发展，我们不仅在物质基础方面大大的雄厚了，而且人们的精神面貌也发生了深刻的变化。拿我个人来说，经过整风运动和反右派斗争，自己的资产阶级个人主义思想和单纯技术观点有所克服，科学技术必须为政治服务的问题也明确起来。同时也使我深切地认识到，任何时候和党必须是一条心，必须走社会主义道路。不论做什么工作，必须坚持政治挂帅。但是，自己究竟应该如何服务，怎样才能服务的好，这些问题还解决的不够深透。经过学习党的八届八中全会的文件，我认识到上述问题所以解决的不好，主要原因是思想改造的还不够，资产阶级思想还没有完全清除，无产阶级的革命人生观，还没有很好的树立起来，因而在思想上还跟不上客观形势的发展。比如，在党提出令人兴奋的赶英国的伟大号召，在工业战线上提出土洋并举的口号，我和其他同志一样，是非常兴奋的。但是内心里这样想过，英国工业在资本主义国家是很发达的，我国要赶上去只有办规模更大、技术更新的工业，这样才能缩短时间，争取速度。觉得发展小的、土的，起不了多大的作用。在大炼钢铁运动中，推广陶土罐炼铁，我就缺乏信心，认为这是早已被淘汰了的东西，使它浪费大，质量低，靠这种方法完成任务不顶用。那时完全没有想到，一切事物的成长过程，就是由低到高，由简单到复杂的发展过程，没有理解到土能出洋，小会出大，小土群会发展成小洋群直至大洋群。事实也正是如此，小土群炼出了大量的铁，发挥了巨大威力，而且在小土群的基础上，成长起许许多多的现代化的冶炼基地，大大地壮大了我国钢铁战线的队伍，增强了钢铁工业的生产能力。所有这些都说明我原来的想法是脱离实际的，眼光是短浅的。又如在科学技术工作上，我过去认为要进行科学研究，就必须有良好的设备和仪器，必须有丰富的资料，必须有高级的工程技术人员，尤其是对尖端科学的研究，更是缺一不可。从这些看法出发，我就觉得党提出全民办科学，不过是鼓励青年人，激发老年人。认为青年技术人员和工农群众知识少、文化低、经验不多。要做也不过是做些一般的技术改革，改变改变操作而已。现在看来，这实质上是一种否认在科学研究工作中大搞群众运动的错误观点。形成这种错误观点的原因，主要还由于我对我国科学工作只有大搞群众运动，才能多快好省的发展，才能在较短时间内赶上世界先进水平的深远意义缺乏深刻理解，不大懂得科学研究靠少数人去做，必然会出现冷冷清清，少慢差费，是和总路线的精神违背的。事实胜于雄辩。广大的青年技术人员和工人群众在技术革新和技术革命运动中，不仅进行一般的技术改革，而且以史无前例的速度，攻克尖端技术，创造出了一个又一个的奇迹。今天看来，我之所以认识不对，就在于没有把科学研究和生产实践密切结合起来，尽管口头上承认工农群众的智慧和力量，是无穷的和伟大的，但在具体问题上，却又轻视工农群众，这实质上是一种资产阶级的科学研究态度的表现。自然科学是生产实践的总结，并为生产服务的。工农群众是生产的直接参加者，工厂、农田又是很好的试验室和研究基地，只有联系生产并且围绕生产关键进行科学技术的研究，才能做出显著的成绩。近几年来科学技术方面的发明创造，多数出自青年技术人员和工农群众之手。这主要是由于他们解放思想，破除迷信，具有敢想敢干的共产主义风格。有了这种风格，别人做过的他们要做，别人没做过的，他们也敢于创造，像这样生龙活虎的革新者，我是屡见不鲜的。从他们的身上，我看到了两点最可贵的东西。第一，他们能听党的话，心红志坚，对革命事业具有无限的忠诚，有着满腔热情和充沛的革命干劲，第二，他们在科学研究中，坚持贯彻了从实践中来又回到实践中去的原则，把科学研究和生产实际密切结合进行。通过这些事实，我深深地认识到，在科学事业中，必须坚持两条腿走路的方针，把科学研究和生产实践结合起来，把专业的科学研究机构和科学工作的群众运动结合起来，高级工程技术人员和青年技术人员以及广大工农群众结合起来。对于老一辈的科学技术人员来说，更要学习青年技术人员和工农群众不怕天、不怕地、敢于革新、敢于创造的大无畏的精神，只有这样，才能真正对社会主义事业有所贡献。否则，抱残守缺，老是迷信洋的，迷信古的，迷信权威，就会一事无成。
    在过去，我学了一些知识，算是一个知识分子，几年来，在党的领导下，虽然也做了一些工作，但是这与党和政府对自己的关怀和照顾比较起来，自己对人民的贡献就还是很微小的，内心感到十分惭愧。为什么自己贡献不多呢？最主要的是自己还没有完全用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点把自己武装起来，也没有从旧书本的理论柜子中解放出来，政治挂帅还坚持不够，思想上还没有真正红起来。
    在过去十年的工作实践中，我深深体会到党对老一辈知识分子是十分关怀和爱护的。我绝不辜负党对我的期望，今后，一定要认真学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作，联系实际，改造思想，在实际工作中，要进一步鼓起革命干劲，克服依赖思想，深入钻研，争取在岗位工作上，更好地完成党和人民交付的任务，并且通过理论学习和业务实践以及社会实践，不断地提高政治觉悟，改变立场，彻底改造非无产阶级思想，坚定地树立无产阶级的世界观，争取尽快地成为一个工人阶级知识分子，更出色地为社会主义服务。
    最后，祝大会胜利成功。
    各位委员身体健康。
