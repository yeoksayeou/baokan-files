Ensure Every Open Female Animal is Bred
Commentator of This Newspaper

    The autumn breeding season for large livestock is approaching. According to statistics from ten provinces and autonomous regions, including Henan, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Jiangsu, by the end of June, only half of the breeding-age female animals had been bred in the spring. Based on the situation in these ten provinces and autonomous regions, more than half of the breeding-age female animals nationwide still need to be bred this autumn. Furthermore, not all of the female animals bred in the first half of the year will necessarily conceive due to reproductive physiology, breeding techniques, and other reasons. Therefore, the number of female animals requiring breeding this autumn is considerable. To lay a solid foundation for the development of large livestock next year, we must seize the opportunity to ensure that every open female animal is bred, and to re-breed those that have already been bred but may not be pregnant, striving to achieve "total breeding and total conception."
    There are many favorable conditions for carrying out the autumn breeding work. Female animals are healthier after grazing on green grass in the summer, making them more likely to go into heat, breed, and conceive. Many regions have completed the summer harvest and planting, and the autumn harvest and planting have not yet begun, providing a relatively light period for agricultural work to focus on breeding. The southern regions have a tradition and experience in autumn breeding, with the masses believing that autumn breeding is the most suitable. Currently, a large number of cadres across the country are deeply involved in the front lines of production, focusing on grain production while also boosting animal husbandry. These are all successful guarantees for launching the autumn breeding campaign for large livestock.
    There is a certain contradiction between breeding and reproductive work and the use of large livestock. Some people are unwilling to allow large livestock to breed because of the need for draught power, which is incorrect. Breeding a female animal typically only takes a few hours to a day. Pregnant and nursing female animals can still be used appropriately, and even if it requires reducing some workload or providing appropriate care, it is not difficult to manage. However, each additional calf born strengthens the reserve force on the agricultural front. We must combine current needs with long-term interests and correctly address the issue of breeding versus usage.
    In recent years, the practical experience of many regions has proven that concentrating female animals to establish breeding farms (teams) is a practical and feasible way to resolve the contradiction between breeding and usage. By concentrating female animals and having them raised and managed by production teams, production brigades, or communes, they can be used rationally on one hand and bred on the other. This approach changes the decentralized management of female animals and implements specialized feeding and management. The rights to breed and use are entirely controlled by the breeding farms, thus allowing for planned adjustments to the relationship between breeding and usage, ensuring both rational usage and timely breeding. The experience of Jilin, Guangxi, and other regions in establishing large-scale female animal breeding farms fully demonstrates the many benefits of centralized breeding for a series of tasks such as breeding, conception, pregnancy maintenance, and raising young animals. Various localities can adapt and adopt this approach according to their own circumstances. If it is not possible to establish female animal breeding farms immediately, temporary centralized breeding or organizing short-term grazing of female animals on the mountains with stud animals for breeding can be adopted according to local conditions, which is also beneficial for carrying out breeding work.
    While carrying out autumn breeding work, attention should also be paid to the improvement of large livestock. Regions with excellent stud animals should make full use of them for breeding. At the same time, artificial insemination should be vigorously developed to improve the utilization rate of stud animals.
    The gestation period for large livestock is very long, with only one calf per year and generally only one calf per pregnancy. Delaying the breeding opportunity will affect the animal's ability to produce offspring for a year. The autumn breeding season is very short, and the number of female animals awaiting breeding is very large, making the task extremely arduous. Leading comrades at all levels on the animal husbandry front must be determined to seize the months of September and October, delve into the front lines of production, lead the masses, strive for "total breeding and total conception," and complete this important task in a down-to-earth manner.

    让空怀母畜头头配种
    本报评论员
    大家畜秋季配种季节到来了。据河南、山西、辽宁、吉林、陕西、宁夏、内蒙古、青海、新疆、江苏等十个省、区6月底的统计，春季配过种的母畜，仅及适龄母畜的一半。照这十个省、区的情况来看，全国还有一半以上的适龄母畜，要在今年秋季配种。上半年已经配过种的母畜，由于生殖生理和配种技术等等原因，也不可能全部受孕。因此，需要在今年秋季配种的母畜，数量是相当大的。为了给明年大家畜的发展奠定可靠的基础，必须抓紧时机，为空怀母畜头头配种，对配过种的母畜查胎补配，力争实现“全配、全准”。
    开展秋季配种工作，有许多有利条件。母畜在夏季吃了青草，体质健壮，易于发情、配种和受胎。很多地区夏收、夏种已毕，秋收、秋种尚未开始，正有一段农活较轻的时期，可以抓紧大搞配种。南方地区原有秋配的习惯和经验，群众认为母畜秋配是最合适的。目前全国各地有大批干部深入生产第一线，大抓粮食生产，同时把畜牧业也带动起来了。这些都是开展大家畜秋配运动的胜利保证。
    在大家畜配种繁殖和使役之间是存在着一定矛盾的。有些人为了使役的需要，不愿让大家畜配种繁殖，这是不对的。母畜配一次种，一般不过用几小时到一天的时间。怀胎、带仔的母畜，仍可适当使役，即使需要减轻一些劳动量，或者需要加以适当的照顾，都是不难办到的。但是，多生一头仔畜，就为农业战线增强一分后备力量。我们必须把目前的需要和长远的利益结合起来，正确对待配种繁殖和使役问题。
    近几年来，许多地区的实践经验证明，集中母畜建立繁殖场（队），是解决繁殖和使役的矛盾的切实可行的办法。把母畜集中起来，由生产小队、生产大队或者公社饲养管理，一方面合理使役，一方面配种繁殖。这种形式改变了母畜分散经营的办法，实行专业饲养管理。配种繁殖和使役权，完全掌握在繁殖场手里，因而可以有计划地调整配种繁殖和使役间的关系，既做到合理使役，又不误配种。吉林、广西等地区大办母畜繁殖场的经验充分说明，集中繁殖对于配种、受胎、保胎、育仔等一系列工作的好处很多。各地可以因地制宜的参考采用。如果一时不能把母畜繁殖场建立起来，可以按照当地情况，采取临时集中配种，或者组织母畜短期上山放牧，配备种公畜跟群配种等方法，这对开展配种工作，也是有利的。
    在进行秋季配种工作的同时，还要注意大家畜的改良工作。有优良种公畜的地区，应该充分利用优良种公畜配种；同时应该大力开展人工授精工作，提高种公畜的利用率。
    大家畜的怀胎期很长，一年只能下一胎，一胎一般只能产一仔。如果延误了配种时机，就会影响大家畜一年不能产仔。秋季配种时间很短，待配母畜数量很多，任务是十分艰巨的。畜牧战线各级领导同志要下定决心，抓紧九、十两月，深入生产第一线，领导群众，力争“全配、全准”，扎扎实实地完成这个重大任务。
