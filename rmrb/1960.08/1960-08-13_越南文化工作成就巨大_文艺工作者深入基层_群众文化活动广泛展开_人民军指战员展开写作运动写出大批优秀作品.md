　　Hanoi News: The Democratic Republic of Vietnam achieved great success in its cultural work in the first half of this year, and some departments have completed their three-year plan ahead of schedule.
　　Deputy Minister of Culture Du Duc Ut reported at a recent work summary meeting held by the Ministry of Culture that this year's publishing work has not only greatly improved in quality, but also serves the central work. The number of books and periodicals published in the first half of the year has exceeded the three-year plan by 6%. The printing and distribution departments have timely met the needs of the masses and further consolidated and expanded the distribution network in counties and townships. The central and provincial/municipal libraries have sent cadres to the grassroots level to establish libraries and reading rooms, and launched a reading campaign.
　　Literary and artistic work has become more deeply rooted in the masses. Thirty-three central and local art troupes have gone to various places to perform for the masses in batches. The film department has organized many mobile projection teams to serve in rural areas. The number of films produced has exceeded the three-year plan. The Ministry of Culture vigorously promoted mass cultural movements, focusing on organizing and leading the masses to read books and periodicals, holding science and technology exhibitions, and carrying out other cultural and artistic activities in the first half of the year. The cultural work force is also growing. Nearly 20,000 new cultural workers have been trained this year. The Ministry of Culture has also opened theoretical and professional schools for 300 cultural workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 11th: A movement to write memoirs of the anti-Japanese war, to write about the most impressive things in life, and to write stories about the army's struggle in building socialism has been enthusiastically responded to by cadres and soldiers in the Vietnamese People's Army, and has produced some works that are popular with readers.

On December 22nd last year, the anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese People's Army, and on January 6th this year, the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese Labor Party, every cadre and soldier in the army expressed their loyalty to the Party through concrete actions such as studying, working, and writing poems and novels. The enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and soldiers, coupled with the attention and mobilization of the leadership, has formed a broad mass writing movement. At the beginning of the movement, General Nguyen Chi Thanh wrote to the generals, mobilizing them to participate in writing, and emphasized that this movement should be seen as an urgent political task. A political commissar of a military region took time out of his busy schedule to write many works. Many soldiers who had never written articles before liberated their minds and wrote down moving stories from the life of the army in crooked handwriting.

In the creation movement, cadres and soldiers wrote thousands of works to serve the current politics. Some units organized heart-to-heart talks to recall old events and find themes, while others organized literary and art symposiums, poetry recitations, and radio broadcasts to introduce the latest works. Many works by cadres and soldiers have been well received by readers after publication.

    越南文化工作成就巨大
    文艺工作者深入基层　群众文化活动广泛展开
    人民军指战员展开写作运动写出大批优秀作品
    本报讯　河内消息：越南民主共和国今年上半年的文化工作获得了巨大的成就，一些部门已经提前完成了三年计划。
    越南文化部副部长杜德育在文化部最近召开的工作总结会议上报告说，今年的出版工作不仅质量有了很大的提高，而且能为中心工作服务，上半年出版的书刊数量已经超额6％完成了三年计划。印刷发行部门及时满足了群众的需要，进一步巩固和扩大了各县、乡的发行网。中央和各省、市的图书馆都派干部深入基层建立图书阅览室，并发动阅读书报运动。
    文艺工作更加深入群众。三十三个中央和地方文工团先后分批到各地为群众演出。电影部门组织了许多巡回放映队到农村去服务。摄制电影部数已经超额完成三年计划。文化部大力促进群众性文化运动，上半年集中力量组织和领导群众阅读书刊，举办科学技术展览并开展其他文艺活动。文化工作队伍也日益壮大。今年新培养的文化工作干部近两万人。文化部还为三百名文化工作干部开办了理论和业务学校。
    新华社河内11日电　写抗战回忆录，写一生中印象最深刻的事情，写军队在建设社会主义斗争中的故事的运动，在越南人民军中得到了干部和战士的热烈响应，并且产生了一些受读者欢迎的作品。
    去年12月22日越南人民军建军节和今年1月6日越南劳动党成立三十周年的时候，军队里的每一位干部、战士都用具体行动，如学习、工作以及写诗歌、写小说来表达他们对党的忠诚。广大干部和战士的热情加上领导的重视和发动，便形成了广泛的群众性的写作运动。运动开始时，阮志清大将写信给将军们，动员他们参加写作，并强调要把这一运动看成是一个迫切的政治工作。一位军区政委就在百忙中抽空写出了很多作品。很多从未写过文章的战士，都解放了思想，用歪歪斜斜的字迹写下了部队生活中动人心弦的故事。
    在创作运动中，干部和战士们写了上千篇作品，为当前的政治服务。有的单位组织谈心会回忆旧事，找寻主题，有的组织文艺座谈会、诗歌朗诵会、广播会，介绍最新作品。干部和战士的不少作品在发表后得到了读者的好评。
