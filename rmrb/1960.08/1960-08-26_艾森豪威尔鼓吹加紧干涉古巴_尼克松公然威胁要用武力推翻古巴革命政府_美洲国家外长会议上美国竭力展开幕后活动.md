Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 25th: U.S. President Eisenhower and Vice President Nixon reiterated on the 24th that the U.S. government would intensify its plot to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and strangle Cuban independence.

Eisenhower focused on the Cuban situation at his weekly press conference. Eisenhower stated that the United States intends to instigate and utilize the Organization of American States, which it controls, to interfere in Cuba and other Latin American countries. If this plot fails, it plans to risk acting alone, saying, "The Organization of American States is an organization that we have strongly supported with all our might for a long period of time. We certainly hope that it will use its collective influence, its moral and political influence, to solve these matters (i.e., his so-called "infiltration and subversion activities")." At the same time, he said, "This does not prevent any government from taking care of its own interests when things have come to a final decision." He believes that the United States' colonialist interests in Latin America "must, of course, be protected." Nixon, speaking at the annual meeting of the American Legion organization in Detroit on the same day, even blatantly clamored that the U.S. government had the military capability to "overthrow" the Castro government "at any time."

Xinhua News Agency, San José, August 24th: After the meeting of foreign ministers of member states of the Organization of American States entered the second stage on the 22nd, centered on the U.S.-instigated collective interference in Cuba, the United States intensified its frantic attacks and slanders against the Cuban revolution, provoked relations between Cuba and other Latin American countries, and vigorously launched behind-the-scenes manipulations and pressure activities. Although the U.S.'s plot to manipulate the meeting to interfere in Cuba was initially frustrated during the first stage of the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Herter insisted at the last plenary session of the first stage on the 20th on forcing the meeting to accept his plan to establish a supranational body, a so-called "special committee" with the power to send troops for armed intervention, to interfere in Cuba. Herter threatened that the U.S. plan, which was rejected by Latin American countries in the first stage of the meeting, could still "serve as a basis for the Organization of American States to consider in the future how to contribute to achieving this important goal (i.e., the so-called "respect for human rights" and the implementation of "representative democracy")." And the so-called "respect for human rights" and "exercise of representative democracy" are pretexts that the United States has always used to interfere in Cuba.

In order to create an atmosphere of hostility towards Cuba at the meeting and pave the way for the implementation of its interference plot, the United States submitted to the meeting on the 22nd a memorandum frantically attacking Cuba, as a supplement to the 78-page report attacking and slandering Cuba that the United States submitted to the Organization of American States in early August. This memorandum shamelessly fabricated that Cuba "is formulating a plan to train communist agents and guerrillas to spread communist revolution throughout Latin America," in an attempt to provoke relations between Cuba and Latin American countries. In this regard, the United States actually presented the voluntary labor of youth representatives from all over the world participating in the construction of the school city project in the Sierra Maestra mountains of Cuba as the only "example" to support the U.S.'s absurd claims.

It was precisely under the vigorous instigation of the United States that Argentine Foreign Minister Diógenes Taboada proposed at the meeting on the 23rd that a special meeting be held by the American Foreign Ministers within ninety days to draft a treaty on the so-called "defense of communism in the Western Hemisphere." At the same meeting that day, Colombian Foreign Minister Turbay suggested establishing a "five-person committee" to mediate the "dispute" between the United States and Cuba; if this committee fails to achieve its purpose, a second committee should be formed "to formulate a common course of action to deal with foreign intervention in the internal affairs of the hemisphere."

However, the situation at the meeting shows that at the very beginning of the second stage of the meeting, the traps set by the United States for further interference in Cuba aroused suspicion and opposition among representatives of some Latin American countries. The United Press International admitted on the 23rd that despite "some behind-the-scenes trickery," some foreign ministers of Latin American countries still "hesitated to openly condemn Cuba."

    艾森豪威尔鼓吹加紧干涉古巴
    尼克松公然威胁要用武力推翻古巴革命政府
    美洲国家外长会议上美国竭力展开幕后活动
    据新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔和副总统尼克松24日再一次表明，美国政府要加紧推行干涉古巴内政和绞杀古巴独立的阴谋。
    艾森豪威尔在他每周例行的记者招待会上着重谈到了古巴局势。艾森豪威尔表示，美国既要策动和利用它控制的美洲国家组织来干涉古巴以及其他拉丁美洲国家，而一旦这一阴谋不能得逞时，又打算冒险单独干，他说，“美洲国家组织是一个我们在很长的时期以来一直是尽我们一切力量强烈地支持的一个组织。我们确实希望它利用它的集体影响、它的道义和政治上的影响，来解决这些事情（即他所谓的“渗透和颠复活动”）”。同时他又说：“这并不妨碍任何政府在事情已成最后定局的时候，照顾它自己的利益”，他认为美国在拉丁美洲的殖民主义利益“当然必须予以保护。”尼克松同一天在底特律的美国退伍军人组织年会上发表演说时甚至赤裸裸地叫嚷美国政府军事上有能力“在任何时间”“推翻”卡斯特罗政府。
    据新华社24日讯　圣约瑟消息：在美洲国家组织成员国外长会议22日进入以美国策动集体干涉古巴为中心的第二阶段以后，美国加紧了对古巴革命的猖狂攻击和诬蔑，挑拨古巴同其它拉丁美洲国家之间的关系，同时极力展开幕后操纵和施加压力的活动。尽管在会议的第一阶段美国操纵会议干涉古巴的阴谋已受到初步的挫败，但美国国务卿赫脱在20日第一阶段的最后一次全体会议上，仍坚持要强使会议接受他的关于建立一个具有派遣军队进行武装干涉权力的所谓“特别委员会”的超国家机构来干涉古巴的方案。赫脱扬言美国这个在第一阶段会议中为拉丁美洲国家所拒绝的方案，仍然“可以作为美洲国家组织将来考虑怎样才能为达到这个重要目的（即所谓“尊重人权”和实行“代议制民主”）作出贡献的问题时的基础”。而所谓“尊重人权”和“行使代议制民主”都是美国一贯用来干涉古巴的借口。
    为了竭力在会议上制造敌视古巴的气氛，以便为推行其干涉阴谋铺平道路，美国在22日又向会议提出一项疯狂攻击古巴的备忘录，作为美国在8月初向美洲国家组织提出的攻击和诬蔑古巴的长达七十八页的报告的补充。这项备忘录无耻地捏造说古巴“正在制定一项训练共产党特务和游击队以在整个拉丁美洲传布共产主义革命的计划”，企图以此来挑拨古巴同拉丁美洲国家之间的关系。在这方面，美国居然提出世界各国青年代表在古巴马埃斯特腊山区参加古巴建设学校城工程的义务劳动这件事，作为支持美国荒谬说法的唯一“例证”。
    正是在美国的极力策动下，阿根廷外交部长迪奥赫内斯·托沃亚达在23日会议上提出由美洲外长们在九十天内召开一次特别会议来草拟一项所谓“在西半球防御共产主义”的条约的建议。在同一天会议上，哥伦比亚外交部长图尔拜建议：设立一个“五人委员会”来干旋美国和古巴的“争端”；如果这个委员会不能达到目的，就成立第二个委员会“来制定共同的行动方针来对付外国插手半球的内部事务”。
    但是，会议的情况表明，在第二阶段会议刚刚开始的时候，美国为进一步干涉古巴而布置的圈套就在一些拉丁美洲国家代表中引起疑惧和反对。合众国际社在23日承认，尽管“有人在幕后使用妙计”，拉丁美洲国家的一些外长们仍然“对于公开谴责古巴的做法表示犹豫”。
