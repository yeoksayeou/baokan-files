Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 19th: Wuhan's education departments are actively training and improving primary and secondary school teachers through various methods. Currently, the vast majority of primary and secondary school teachers in the city are using part of their summer vacation for refresher courses and lesson preparation in order to prepare for the launch of teaching reform in the next semester.

Starting next semester, some schools in Wuhan will pilot a new school system and adopt new textbooks. Schools that do not pilot the new school system for the time being will also modify and supplement the original teaching content to improve the quality of teaching. This urgently requires supplementing the teaching staff and improving the level of in-service teachers. Therefore, since the spring of this year, Party organizations and education departments at all levels have adopted various methods to train and improve primary and secondary school teachers to meet the needs of the development and improvement of education. All normal colleges and universities in the city are training teachers for various schools according to their needs in a planned way. Each school also organizes various short-term training courses based on the principle of combining long-term training with short-term training to train teachers by subject and in stages. In order to train foreign language teachers, normal colleges and universities and education departments in various districts have organized short-term foreign language training courses to specially train foreign language teachers in primary and secondary schools.

The Wuhan Municipal Education Department pays special attention to the improvement of in-service teachers. The municipal and district-level teacher training colleges have organized refresher courses in various subjects based on the principle of "teach what you learn, supplement what you lack," and have absorbed thousands of primary and secondary school teachers to study. Many schools also strengthen teachers' extracurricular research activities in the form of teaching and research groups. The mathematics teaching and research group of Wuhan No. 1 Middle School has persisted in learning relevant new knowledge in their spare time since the last semester in order to meet the teaching tasks of the new semester. Various education departments and schools also hold various new science and technology report meetings, seminars, and visits to help teachers understand new scientific and technological achievements and expand their knowledge fields in order to improve the quality of teaching. The city and districts have specially organized radio refresher schools, correspondence courses, and lectures in various subjects for primary and secondary school teachers. Tens of thousands of teachers have participated in the study, which has also played a positive role in improving the level of teachers.

In strengthening teacher training, schools and departments in Wuhan have given full play to the spirit of communist cooperation, and many universities and normal schools have enthusiastically participated in this work. Some universities have organized teachers and students to form lecture groups to give lectures in various places, and some departments have formed working groups to go deep into various schools to prepare lessons and study together with teachers, meticulously helping teachers improve their teaching level.

    为下学期开展教学改革工作作好准备
    武汉积极培训中小学教师
    新华社武汉19日电　武汉市教育部门采取多种办法积极培训和提高中、小学教师，现在，全市绝大多数的中、小学教师正在利用暑期一部分时间进修备课，为下学期开展教学改革作准备。
    从下学期开始，武汉市将有一些学校试行新学制，采用新教材；暂不试行新学制的学校，也将对原有教学内容作修改、补充，以提高教学质量。这就迫切需要补充师资力量和提高在职教师水平。因此，从今春开始，各级党组织和教育部门采取了多种办法培训和提高中、小学教师，以适应教育工作发展、提高的需要。市内各个师范院校都根据需要，有计划地为各学校培训师资。各校还根据长期培养和短期训练相结合的原则，举办了各种短期训练班，分科、分期地培养师资。为了培训外语教师，各师范院校和各区的教育部门举办了外语短期训练班，专门培训中、小学的外语教师。
    武汉市教育部门特别注意在职教师的提高工作。市、区两级的教师进修学院，都根据“教什么、学什么，缺什么、补什么”的原则，分别举办各科进修班，吸收了数千名中、小学教师学习。许多学校还以教研组为单位，加强教师业余研究活动。武汉市第一中学数学教研组为了迎接新学期的教学任务，从上学期起就坚持在业余时间学习有关的新知识。各个教育部门和学校还举办多种新科学技术报告会、座谈会和参观活动，帮助教师了解新的科学技术成就，扩大知识领域，以便提高教学质量。市、区专门为中、小学教师举办了广播进修学校、函授班和各科讲座，有上万名教师参加了学习，对提高教师水平也起了积极作用。
    在加强教师的培训工作中，武汉市各学校、各部门发挥了共产主义协作精神，许多高等学校和师范学校都热情地参加了这一工作。有的高等学校组织师生成立了讲师团到各地巡回讲学，有的部门成立了工作组，深入到各个学校里同教师们一起备课，一起研究，细致地帮助教师提高教学水平。
