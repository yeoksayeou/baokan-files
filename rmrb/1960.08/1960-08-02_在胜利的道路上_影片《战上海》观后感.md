    On the Road to Victory
    ——Reflections on the Film "Battle of Shanghai"	Gu Quanxiong

    The film "Battle of Shanghai," produced by the August First Film Studio, is a film depicting the heroic historical events of the People's Liberation Army liberating Shanghai. It enthusiastically praises the People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong's military thought, as invincible, all-conquering, resourceful, and heroic, and sharply exposes the reactionary nature of the Kuomintang reactionaries and their master, American imperialism. From beginning to end, the film, with a lively pace and concise techniques, attractively grips the audience's attention.

    According to the correct guidelines indicated by the Party and Chairman Mao, the battle to liberate Shanghai should proceed from protecting the interests of the people, both eliminating the enemy and preserving Shanghai, and completely seizing this modernized city from the enemy's hands and handing it over to the people. What an acute and complex struggle this is! The senior generals of the People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong's military thought, brilliantly analyzed the contradictions within the enemy's factions, studied the infighting between Shao Zhuang, Chiang Kai-shek's direct descendant and army commander, and Liu Yi, an old fox who had been anti-communist for twenty-two years, and made a wise decision, unexpectedly choosing Shao Zhuang's main force as a weakness, launching a barrage of artillery fire, and utterly destroying Shao Zhuang's corps, which prided itself on its strong forces and unprepared arrogance, breaking through his outer defenses, and placing Shao Zhuang in a position of isolation and helplessness. After this, our army adhered to the principle of eliminating the enemy's main force on the periphery to ensure the integrity of the city and the safety of the people, and ordered the front-line troops to stop pursuing in order to lure the enemy to counterattack and wipe them out in one fell swoop. As our army's political commissar wisely analyzed: "If Tang Yunfu were a brilliant military strategist, seeing through that you are waiting for him with an open pocket, he would not come out. But the enemy is, after all, the enemy. In order to save his dying fate, the enemy has to counterattack, because the loss of the periphery will lose the enemy's most precious time!" Yes, reactionaries are ultimately reactionaries. Although Tang Yunfu and Shao Zhuang knew that a counterattack would lead to failure, they could not but make a last-ditch struggle. The wolves were finally lured out. The enemy troops crawled like maggots towards the empty positions, reoccupying their outer defenses. Just as Shao Zhuang was gloating and reporting his merits to his superiors, our army suddenly concentrated its firepower to counterattack, catching him off guard, and finally eliminating the enemy's main force on the periphery.

    After our army entered the urban area, in the battle to liberate the north bank of the Suzhou River, relying on the coordination of the Shanghai underground party and the worker masses, it thwarted the special agent chief Tu Sen's conspiracy to destroy the city; at the same time, military pressure and political offensive were used simultaneously, forcing Liu Yi to cease fire and revolt, liberating all of Shanghai.

    The film vividly depicts the People's Liberation Army's courageous and resourceful fighting spirit in overcoming difficulties and dangers to ensure the safety of the people and the integrity of the city, and also enthusiastically praises the Shanghai underground party and the worker masses for their coordination in the battle, overcoming numerous difficulties and dangers, uniting the broad masses of citizens, preventing the enemy's sabotage activities, resolutely safeguarding the safety of industrial and mining enterprises and the city, and achieving final victory. There is such a plot in the film: The Kuomintang reactionaries, seeing that their fate was in danger, dispatched tanks and a large number of military police, attempting to blow up the power plant. The enemy and bandit company commander threatened the workers, saying, "For military needs, I am ordered by my superiors to blow up the power plant. Those who want to live, get out of here obediently." The workers replied with voices as loud as thunder: "The factory is the lifeline of us workers, we will not leave!" In this long-standing stalemate, they gained time, and our army quickly occupied the power plant, so that the enemy's sabotage conspiracy ultimately failed. Seeing this, we are deeply moved by the Shanghai workers' high level of class consciousness and lofty revolutionary sense of responsibility.

    The film also uses contrast to profoundly expose the enemy's wolfish nature. The insidious and vicious enemy commander Tang Yunfu, on the one hand, strengthened the outer defenses, and on the other hand, ordered his executioner Tu Sen to cruelly and bloodily suppress our underground party and revolutionary masses, attempting to prevent our army from liberating Shanghai and saving his dying fate. Tu Sen said to his superior Tang Yunfu, "If we only think of this matter now, we would have ceased to exist long ago." This sentence incisively exposes the Kuomintang reactionaries' consistent reactionary essence of harming the people. As the camera shifts, we see scenes of revolutionaries being brutally murdered by the enemy on the screen, arousing boundless anger towards the Kuomintang reactionaries.

    While exposing the Kuomintang reactionaries' insidious cruelty, the film also thoroughly exposes the aggressive nature of the deadly enemy of the Chinese people—American imperialism. We see the American consulate filled with precious handicrafts plundered from the hands of the Chinese people. Who is not disgusted and hateful towards the shameless plunder of the American robbers? History proves that the aggressive nature of imperialism will never change. We see from the film that when the enemy commander Tang Yunfu asks his backstage boss, American imperialism, for assistance, the American military attache arrogantly rotates the globe and says, "Only force can conquer the whole world." Even when our army had already liberated Shanghai, the American consul still fiercely said to the special agent chief Tu Sen, "We will not stop the war for a single day until the Communist Party is eliminated from the earth." These few words completely expose the aggressive nature of imperialism. But the heroic Chinese people finally used a just war, used blood to exchange for eternal victory, just as Commander Fang said at the end of the film, "The liberation of Shanghai marks the complete demise of the imperialist forces of aggression in China, marks the Chinese people's eternal acquisition of independence and liberation, let those warmongers tremble in the face of the powerful Chinese people!"

    The reason why the film "Battle of Shanghai" is touching is also because the film's directors are good at selecting events with typical significance, and through the specific actions of the characters, they show the heroic image and excellent qualities of the commanders and fighters of our People's Liberation Army. The film successfully shaped some vivid and full-blooded heroic images. Such as Commander Fang, Zhao Yongsheng, Mother Zhao, Xiao Ma, Lin Fan, etc. In the battle to liberate the north bank of the Suzhou River, the scene of squad leader Zhao Yongsheng carrying explosives and bravely rushing onto the Sichuan Road Bridge amidst the enemy's hail of bullets is unforgettable to us, and it fully demonstrates the noble qualities of the People's Liberation Army sacrificing heroically for the cause of the people's liberation. The image of Mother Zhao in the film is a typical example of the heroic mothers of our time. She said, "I am very happy to be a revolutionary auntie." Mother Zhao truly worked for the Party year after year, day after day, and in the long and difficult years before liberation, she was always full of confidence in the victory of the revolution. The film also vividly portrays the slave-like aspects of the Kuomintang reactionaries through the shaping of three senior officers of the enemy army, which further increases our understanding and hatred of the enemy.

    It is all the more practically significant to show "Battle of Shanghai" when we are building socialism with full confidence. By reviewing the arduous and victorious road we have traveled through the film, and reliving the revolutionary spirit of the People's Liberation Army, fearing no difficulties and dangers, advancing courageously, and defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism, we are even more motivated to arouse our confidence and strength to oppose imperialist aggression, defend world peace, and build a socialist motherland.

    在胜利的道路上
    ——影片《战上海》观后感	顾泉雄
    八一电影制片厂摄制的《战上海》，是一部描写我人民解放军解放上海的英雄史实的影片。它热情歌颂了以毛主席军事思想武装起来的人民解放军战无不胜、攻无不克，智勇双全，可歌可泣的英雄事迹，尖锐地揭露了国民党反动派及其主子美帝国主义的反动面目。影片自始至终以明快的节奏，简洁的手法，引人入胜地紧紧扣住观众的心弦。
    根据党和毛主席所指示的正确方针，解放上海之战，应该从保护人民利益出发，既要消灭敌人，又要保全上海，要把上海这座近代化城市完完整整从敌人手里夺回来交给人民。这是一场多么尖锐而复杂的斗争啊！以毛主席军事思想武装起来的人民解放军高级将领，英明地分析了敌军内部派系的矛盾，研究了蒋介石的嫡系军长邵壮和反共二十二年的老狐狸刘义军长之间勾心斗角的矛盾所在，作出了明智的决策，出其不意，选择敌军主力邵壮作为弱点，万炮齐发，打了他个落花流水，一举摧毁了自恃兵力雄厚、骄横无备的邵壮兵团，突破了他的外围防线，使邵壮处于孤立无援的境地。在这以后，我军坚持了将敌人主力消灭在外围以保障城市完整和人民安全的思想原则，命令前线部队停止追击，以便诱敌反扑，一网打尽。正如我军政委所明智分析的那样：“汤云甫如果是个高明的军事家，看破了你张着口袋等着他，他是不会出来的。可是敌人究竟是敌人，为了挽救他垂死的命运，敌人非反扑不可，因为外围的失利，将丧失敌人最宝贵的时间！”是的，反动派终究是反动派，汤云甫和邵壮虽然明知反扑是失败，却不能不作垂死挣扎，狼到底被引出来了，敌军像蛆虫一样向空着的阵地爬行，重新占据了他们的外围防线。正当邵壮得意忘形地向他的上司报功的时候，我军突然集中火力反攻，打他个措手不及，终于把敌人主力消灭在外围。
    我军进入市区后，在解放苏州河北的战役中，依靠了上海地下党和工人群众的配合，粉碎了特务头子屠森的破坏城市的阴谋；同时，军事压力和政治攻势双管齐下，迫使刘义停火起义，解放了全上海。
    影片生动地描绘了人民解放军为保障人民的安全和城市的完整，不畏艰险，不惧困难，创造性地发挥了大勇大智的战斗精神，也热情地歌颂了上海地下党和工人群众配合战斗，克服重重艰险和困难，团结广大市民，阻止了敌人的破坏活动，坚决保卫了工矿企业和城市的安全，获得最后胜利的功绩。影片中有这样一段情节：国民党反动派眼看自己的命运危在旦夕，出动了坦克和大批军警，企图炸毁发电厂。敌匪连长威胁工人说，“为了军事需要，本人奉上司命令要炸毁发电厂，愿意活命的都给我乖乖离开这里。”工人们气壮山河声如雷鸣地回答：“工厂是我们工人的命根子，我们不离开！”就这样在长时间相持的斗争中，赢得了时间，我军迅速占领了发电厂，使敌人的破坏阴谋终不能得逞。看到这里，我们深为上海工人高度的阶级觉悟和崇高的革命责任感所感动。
    影片还通过对比手法，深刻地揭露了敌人的豺狼本性。阴险毒辣的敌军司令汤云甫，一面加强外围防守，另一面命令他手下刽子手屠森残酷地血腥镇压我地下党和革命群众，企图阻止我军解放上海，挽救他垂死的命运。屠森对着他的上司汤云甫说：“如果现在我们才想到这件事情，那我们早已经不存在了。”这句话一针见血地揭露了国民党反动派一贯危害人民的反动本质。随着镜头的转换，我们在银幕上看到了革命者惨遭敌人杀戮的场面，激起了对国民党反动派的无比愤怒。
    影片在暴露国民党反动派阴险残忍的同时，对中国人民的死敌——美帝国主义的侵略本性，也作了淋漓尽致的揭露。我们看到美国领事馆摆满了从中国人民手中搜括去的珍贵的工艺品，谁不为美国强盗的无耻掠夺而切齿痛恨。历史证明，帝国主义的侵略本性是永远不会改变的。我们从影片中看到，当敌军司令汤云甫向他的后台老板美帝国主义求援的时候，美国武官骄横地转动着地球说：“只有武力才能征服全世界。”直到我军已经解放了上海，美国领事还狠狠地对着特务头子屠森说，“共产党一天不从地球上消灭，我们就一天不停止战争。”这几句话彻底暴露了帝国主义的侵略本性。但是英勇的中国人民，终于用正义的战争，用鲜血换来了永远的胜利，正如影片结束时方军长所说的，“上海的解放，标志着帝国主义的侵略势力在中国的彻底灭亡，标志着中国人民永远获得了独立解放，让那些战争贩子们在强大的中国人民面前发抖吧！”
    影片《战上海》之所以感人，还在于影片的编导善于选择富有典型意义的事件，通过人物的具体行动，展现出我人民解放军指战员的英雄形象和优秀品质。影片成功地塑造了一些血肉丰满的英雄形象。如方军长、赵永生、赵妈妈、小马、林凡等。在解放苏州河北的战役中，班长赵永生挟着炸药，冒着敌人的枪林弹雨，勇猛地冲上四川路桥的镜头，使我们难以忘记，它充分表现了人民解放军为了人民解放事业英勇牺牲的高贵品质。影片中的赵妈妈的形象，是我们时代英雄母亲的典型。她说：“当革命的娘姨我心里很高兴。”赵妈妈真是这样终年如一日地为党工作，在解放前漫长而又艰难的岁月里，她对革命始终充满着胜利的信心。影片还通过敌军三个高级军官的塑造，维妙维肖刻划出了国民党反动派的奴才本相，更增加了我们对敌人的认识和仇恨。
    正当我们满怀信心建设社会主义的时候，放映《战上海》更有它的现实意义。通过影片回顾一下我们曾经走过的艰苦和胜利的道路，重温一下人民解放军不畏艰险，勇往直前，打垮国民党反动派和美帝国主义的革命精神，使我们更加激发起反对帝国主义侵略、捍卫世界和平、建设社会主义祖国的信心和力量。影片《战上海》镜头之一：方军长和战士们在上海外围的阵地上
