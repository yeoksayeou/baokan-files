Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 27th: The Lin County Party Committee, while firmly grasping the management of autumn fields, has started early to arrange the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" work for next year's wheat. Communes, brigades, and teams are now universally signing contracts, so that the sown area, yield targets, seeds, fertilizers, labor, planting time, factory and mine support, and leadership strength for wheat are all assigned to production teams and high-yield plots. This further mobilizes the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and masses to strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

As early as the end of July, the eighteen secretaries and members of the Lin County Party Committee went to mountainous and hilly areas, arid and flood-prone areas to carefully investigate the wheat yield increase experiences of previous years. Based on the results of the investigation, the County Party Committee conducted research and believed that starting early to arrange the 1961 wheat "Three Guarantees and One Reward" work, determining the sown area and yield targets for wheat, and signing contracts at each level is an important link in further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses, doing a good job in preparing for wheat sowing, and also an effective measure to ensure that wheat is planted well in every plot and to truly eliminate the three types of wheat before sowing. In preparing for wheat sowing, it is necessary to focus on "Eight Implementations": First, implement the sown area, with the county and communes implementing the area to the production teams, and the production teams implementing it to the plots. Based on the soil quality and stubble, land planning should be done as early as possible to ensure that not a single mu is missing. Second, implement the yield targets, and formulate realistic and reliable yield increase targets at each level. Brigades should do a good job in signing "Three Guarantees and One Reward" (guaranteeing labor, guaranteeing output, guaranteeing investment, and rewarding overproduction) contracts with production teams. Third, implement the seeds, and determine what varieties to plant and how much seed to use as early as possible based on the principle of adapting to local conditions and reasonable close planting. Before the autumn harvest, the brigades should distribute the seeds to the production teams as early as possible and prepare for germination tests and warm water soaking. Fourth, implement the fertilizers, and require that fertilizers be universally delivered to the fields ten days to half a month before the autumn harvest to ensure that not a single mu is lacking. Fifth, implement the labor force. Not only should there be sufficient labor, but also enough furrow holders and plow holders should be selected and trained early, and piecework norms for various farm works should be established and responsibility areas delineated to ensure the quality of farm work. Sixth, ensure timely sowing. Seventh, all walks of life should formulate support plans around wheat sowing work as early as possible, and county and commune industries should support communes and teams to ensure timely supply of tools, fertilizers, and pesticides. Eighth, implement the leadership strength. From now on, cadres will be assigned to take responsibility for specific areas, and now they will focus on preparation, and in the future they will be responsible for area and yield increase.

In order to conscientiously do these tasks, the County Party Committee convened a four-level cadre meeting in early August to determine the county's wheat sowing plan and study and formulate wheat yield increase targets at each level. The County Party Committee also transferred 410 cadres from county-level departments to settle down in high-yield plots, and will be responsible from now until the wheat harvest next year.

After arranging the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" work early, all communes and brigades in the county launched a campaign to offer suggestions and contribute ideas for striving for a bumper wheat harvest next year and to summarize wheat yield increase experiences. After signing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" contract, the Shencun Brigade of the Heshun Commune carefully inspected and found that the base fertilizer for 280 mu of land was still not secured, and that plows, harrows, seeders and furrow holders and plow holders were also insufficient. The brigade cadres immediately made clear division of labor, with the branch secretary in charge of current production, the brigade leader in charge of autumn cultivation preparation, the first deputy branch secretary in charge of sowing preparation, and the second deputy branch secretary in charge of harvesting preparation, thereby greatly accelerating the progress of various preparatory tasks. Many communes, while vigorously strengthening autumn field management and carrying out fertilizer accumulation campaigns, actively repaired field channels to ensure that every plot was level and the canals were clear, so that winter wheat could be sown in due season. At present, 2,720 specialized teams for wheat sowing preparation have been formed throughout the county, and a large amount of base fertilizer has been prepared for wheat. The four mountainous communes in the county with small wheat planting areas and abundant livestock power have also signed cooperation contracts with the six plain communes with large wheat planting areas. Other industries have also formulated support plans around the wheat sowing preparation work.

### 抽调干部一包到底　适时种足块块种好  林县种麦准备工作落实到队

    抽调干部一包到底　适时种足块块种好
    林县种麦准备工作落实到队
    新华社郑州27日电　中共林县县委在狠抓秋田管理的同时，及早动手安排明年小麦的“三包一奖”工作。社社队队目前普遍订合同，使小麦播种面积、产量指标、种籽、肥料、劳力、播种时间、厂矿支援和领导力量都落实到生产队和丰产方，进一步调动了广大干部、群众争取明年小麦丰收的积极性。
    早在7月底，中共林县县委十八名书记和委员就分头到山区和丘陵区、干旱及易涝区，认真考察了历年的小麦增产经验。根据考察结果，县委进行了研究，认为及早动手安排1961年小麦“三包一奖”工作，确定小麦的播种面积和产量指标，逐级签订合同，是进一步调动广大群众积极性，做好麦播准备工作的重要一环，同时也是确保小麦块块种好，真正做到把三类麦消灭在播种以前的有效措施。在小麦播种准备上，一定要抓好“八落实”：一、播种面积落实，县、公社把面积落实到生产队，生产队落实到地块，根据土质、茬口，及早做好土地规划，保证一亩不少。二、产量指标落实，逐级制订切实可靠的增产指标，大队对生产队要做好签订“三包一奖”（包工、包产、包投资，超产奖励）合同的工作。三、种籽落实，根据因地制宜与合理密植的原则，及早确定种什么品种、下多少种，秋收前各大队要及早把种子发到生产队，作好发芽试验和温汤浸种等准备工作。四、肥料落实，要求秋收前十天到半月普遍把肥料送到地头，保证一亩不缺。五、劳力落实，不仅要有足够的劳动力，而且要及早挑选和训练足够的扶耧手和扶犁手，做好各种农活的包工定额，划定责任区，保证农活的质量。六、确保适时下种。七、各行各业及早围绕小麦播种工作，制订支援计划，县、公社工业要包社，包队，保证工具、肥料、农药供应及时。八、领导力量落实，从现在起就抽调干部分地区包干，现在抓准备，将来包面积、包增产。
    为了认真做好这些工作，县委在8月上旬又召开了四级干部会议，确定了全县小麦播种计划，逐级研究制订了小麦增产指标。县委并且从县直属机关中抽调出四百一十名干部到丰产方安家落户，从现在起一直包到明年麦收。
    及早安排“三包一奖”工作以后，全县各公社、大队都掀起了为争取明年小麦丰收献策献计和总结小麦增产经验的运动。河顺公社申村大队在签订“三包一奖”合同后，全队仔细进行了检查，发现还有二百八十亩地的底肥没着落，另外犁、耙、耧等工具和扶犁手、扶耧手也不够。大队干部立即进行了明确分工，支部书记抓当前生产，大队长抓秋耕准备，第一副支书抓播种准备，第二副支书抓收割准备，从而大大加快了各项准备工作的进展。许多公社在大力加强秋田管理和开展积肥运动的同时，积极整修田间渠道，保证块块地平渠通，冬麦适时下种。目前，全县已组成各种麦播准备工作专业队二千七百二十个，已为小麦准备了大量的底肥。全县四个种麦面积小、畜力多的山区公社，还和六个种麦面积大的平原地区公社签订了协作合同。其它各行各业也都围绕小麦播种准备工作，制订了支援计划。
