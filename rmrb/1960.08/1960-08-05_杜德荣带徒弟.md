    Du Derong Teaches Apprentices

    Old electrician Du Derong has only been in the countryside for four months, but he has already trained more than thirty electrical technicians for the Changzheng People's Commune in Jiading. Old Du was originally an old electrician at the Shanghai State-owned No. 5 Cotton Mill. This year, when he and everyone else went to the countryside, he discovered that the Changzheng People's Commune lacked electrical technicians, so he proactively suggested to the commune's Party committee that they start a technical training class. At the time, some people said:
    "Old Du, we're here to help the farmers reform their agricultural tools, don't divert your energy!" But this old electrician replied: "You can't say that. Machines and tools need people to use them, and we not only have to help the farmers reform their agricultural tools, but also have a responsibility to teach the farmers to master modern technology."
    With the support of the Party committee, Old Du compiled his twenty years of electrical experience into teaching materials and carefully taught them to the commune members. Sometimes, afraid that the commune members wouldn't understand, he enthusiastically led everyone to the site to observe the real objects and patiently explain...
    One day, Old Du learned that the machine at the Wangjiawan mobile electric irrigation station in the commune had broken down, and commune member Yan Baoying didn't know how to repair it, so he rode his bicycle to Wangjiawan. Old Du is an impatient person, and he accidentally fell into the river while stepping onto the small boat. He was soaked to the bone and his foot was injured. People advised him to rest, but he refused, insisting on repairing the machine, while also seizing the opportunity to teach his apprentice Yan Baoying the technology. He was hungry, wearing wet clothes, and squatted on the boat for more than three hours; finally, he repaired the machine. Because he explained while repairing the machine, his apprentice also basically mastered the technology of repairing motors. Yan Baoying said with emotion: "Master Du, I not only want to learn technology from you, but also want to learn your noble qualities of the working class!" (Shanghai Hu Shen)

    杜德荣带徒弟
    老电工杜德荣下乡只有四个多月，就给嘉定长征人民公社培养了三十多个电气技术人员。老杜原是上海国棉五厂的老电工，今年他和大家下乡时，发现长征人民公社缺乏电气技术人员，就主动建议公社党委开办一个技术训练班。当时有人说：
  “老杜，咱们是来帮助农民改革农具的，不要分散精力吧！”可是这个老电工回答：“不能这样说。机器和工具要靠人来使用，我们不但要帮助农民改革农具，也有责任教会农民掌握现代技术。”
    老杜在党委的支持下，把自己二十多年的电工经验编写成教材，认真地教给社员们。有时他怕社员们听不懂，还热心地领着大家到现场去，一边观察实物，一边耐心地讲……
    有一天老杜知道公社王家湾流动电灌站的机器出了毛病，社员严宝英不会修，他就骑车赶到王家湾。老杜的性子急，在跨上小船时一不小心，掉进河里。浑身都湿透了，脚也受了伤。人家劝他歇歇，他不听，坚决要去修机器，同时还抓住机会给徒弟严宝英讲技术。他饿着肚皮，穿着湿衣，蹲在船上三个多钟头；终于把机器修好了。因为边修机器边讲解，徒弟也基本上掌握了修理马达的技术。严宝英感动地说：“杜师傅，我不但要向你学技术，还要学习你这种工人阶级的高贵品质！”（上海　胡申）
