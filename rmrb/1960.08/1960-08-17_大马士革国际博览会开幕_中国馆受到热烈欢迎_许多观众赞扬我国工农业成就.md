The Chinese Pavilion is divided into four sections: heavy industrial products; agricultural products, agricultural by-products, and native products; light industrial products and textiles; and handicrafts.

Visitors told the staff of the Chinese Pavilion that they were proud of China's achievements in heavy industry. Many visitors used words like "remarkable" and "excellent" to describe the Chinese Pavilion.

The audience was most interested in the Chinese-made "Red Flag" brand cars, machine tools, and photographs, charts, and models related to people's communes.

Three farmers from northern Syria shouted "Long Live People's China" after seeing the exhibits related to people's communes. These farmers also asked for crop seeds to sow on their land.
