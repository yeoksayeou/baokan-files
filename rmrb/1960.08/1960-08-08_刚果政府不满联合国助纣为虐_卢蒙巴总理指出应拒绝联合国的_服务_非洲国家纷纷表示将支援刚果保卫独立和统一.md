Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: The attitude of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and the UN forces, under the manipulation of the United States, in sheltering and condoning Belgian aggression and the splitting of the Congo has aroused strong dissatisfaction among Congolese government officials and some African countries. African countries have expressed their willingness to support the Congo in defending its independence and unity.

Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba, in a telegram sent to Congolese President Kasavubu on the 6th from Guinea, condemned Hammarskjöld's refusal to send troops to Katanga, occupied by Belgian troops, as tending to favor the Katanga secessionist movement. He said, "For the highest interests of the country, we must expose without delay this conspiracy, which belongs to the category of major strategy. I urgently request you to convene a Council of Ministers and make a decision to reject the services of the United Nations. This decision must be immediately notified to the UN Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council."

In the telegram, Lumumba pointed out that the United Nations forces "are not helping us to get the Belgian forces, which are hostile to us, to withdraw." He also said, "We will solve the Katanga issue ourselves, because it is an internal affair, and the United Nations can only intervene when we request it."

Lumumba said: "We are confident of obtaining direct military assistance from African countries. I am negotiating agreements in this direction, and all African countries are ready to help us."

On the same day, Lumumba and the President of Guinea issued a joint communiqué after their meeting, strongly condemning "Belgian imperialism and its allies" for their armed intervention in the Congo. The communiqué said, "Guinea strongly condemns the subversive activities of Belgian imperialism and its allies, who are trying to influence (the Congo's) independence again through armed intervention."

The communiqué expressed opposition to the divisive policy carried out in Katanga under the instigation and direction of imperialism against the national unity of the Congo. It demanded that the UN forces immediately enter Katanga, saying, "The intervention of the United Nations is and can only be justified within the strict scope of the unequivocal, sincere, and thorough implementation of the Security Council resolutions." If Hammarskjöld refuses or delays sending UN troops to Katanga Province "within the scope of the mission entrusted" by the Security Council, the Guinean government "will, in the spirit of African solidarity, immediately place all Guinean armed forces entirely at the disposal of the government of the Congolese Republic in order to guarantee the territorial integrity of the Congo."

The communiqué also expressed full and complete support for the Algerian people who are heroically fighting for their independence; condemned the apartheid policy of the South African Federation; and paid tribute to and supported the liberation struggles of the people of all countries still under foreign rule.

On the same day, Ghanaian President Nkrumah said at a press conference in Accra on the situation in the Congo, "Any solution (to the Katanga Province issue in the Congo) can only be based on the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all Belgian troops." He said that African countries "will not allow the creation in the center of Africa of a puppet state maintained by Belgian troops and meeting the needs of an international mining company."

Nkrumah stated that if the United Nations cannot resolve the Katanga issue, Ghana is willing to provide "the kind of military assistance that the Republic of the Congo may request."

In order to state the Congo's views at the United Nations Security Council meeting on the 7th to discuss the situation in the Congo, Congolese Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga had already left Leopoldville for New York on the 6th, leading a Congolese government delegation. In a statement before his departure, Gizenga accused Hammarskjöld of adopting a policy favorable to the Tshombe group, which is attempting to split Katanga.

A Congolese government spokesman said on the 6th that the Congo no longer understands the attitude of the United Nations. He also said, "As for the Congolese people, they believe that Hammarskjöld and Bunche have been bought by Katanga's millionaires."

Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: Leopoldville news: A group of Congolese youths held a demonstration in front of the Belgian Embassy in Leopoldville, the capital of the Congo, today, protesting against the Belgian colonial army's occupation of Congolese territory. The demonstrators shouted slogans demanding that Belgian troops get out of the Congo and that the Belgian Embassy be closed. Subsequently, they went to demonstrate in front of the United Nations headquarters in the Congo.

The news said that when the Congolese youths were demonstrating, the UN troops there took "precautionary" measures.

Mwanba Ilunga, one of the leaders of the Balubakat Party, an opposition party in Katanga Province, Congo, also issued a statement on the 6th, demanding that the Belgian colonialists leave and protesting against the conspiracy of the province's Governor Tshombe to split Katanga Province from the Congo with the support of the Belgian colonialists. The members of this party and its alliance in the Katanga Provincial Assembly had earlier withdrawn from the Provincial Assembly hall to protest against the Tshombe group's conspiracy to "independize" Katanga Province.

The Belgian colonialists and the Tshombe group are therefore intensifying their suppression of this party. According to reports, on the evening of the 5th, a "gendarmerie" commanded by Belgian officers attacked the party headquarters in Elisabethville, destroyed the furniture and windows of the office, and arrested 35 party members, who were not released until the morning of the 6th. According to Ilunga, this was the third attack in several weeks.

Belgium is continuing to deploy troops in Katanga Province. On the evening of the 5th, it transferred another 455 soldiers from the 12th Infantry Battalion from the Kamina base to Elisabethville to strengthen the Belgian occupation forces there. News indicates that Belgian paratroopers are tightly controlling the airport there.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: Elisabethville News: Tshombe, the governor of Katanga Province in the Congo, who is engaged in secessionist activities under the wings of the Belgian colonial army, announced on the 6th in Elisabethville, the capital of the province, that he had instructed a Katanga "delegation" currently active in Brussels, the capital of Belgium, to go to New York immediately to participate in the United Nations Security Council's discussion on the Congo issue scheduled for the 7th.

Tshombe also said that if possible, he himself would also go to New York.

According to reports, the head of this Katanga "delegation," Kibwe, arrived in New York on the 7th.

    刚果政府不满联合国助纣为虐
    卢蒙巴总理指出应拒绝联合国的“服务”
    非洲国家纷纷表示将支援刚果保卫独立和统一
    新华社7日讯　联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和联合国部队在美国操纵下，包庇和纵容比利时侵略和分裂刚果的态度，引起了刚果政府人士和一些非洲国家的强烈不满，非洲国家纷纷表示将支援刚果，来保卫它的独立和统一。
    刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴在6日从几内亚拍给刚果总统卡萨武布的电报中，谴责哈马舍尔德拒绝派军队到比利时军队占领的加丹加去的作法是趋向于赞成加丹加的分裂运动。他说，“为了国家的最高利益，我们必须毫不迟延地揭露这种属于重大战略范畴的阴谋。我迫切地谨请你召集部长会议并作出拒绝联合国的服务的决定。必须把这个决定立即通知联合国秘书长和安全理事会主席。”
    卢蒙巴在电报中指出，联合国的部队“不是帮助我们使同我们敌对的比利时部队撤走”。他还说，“我们将由我们自己来解决加丹加问题，因为这是内政问题，联合国只有在我们提出要求时才能进行干预。”
    卢蒙巴说：“我们有把握得到非洲各国的直接军事援助。我正在朝着这个方向商谈缔结协议，所有的非洲国家都准备帮助我们”。
    当天，卢蒙巴和几内亚总统在会谈后发表了一项强烈谴责“比利时帝国主义及其同盟者”对刚果进行武装干涉的联合公报。公报说，“几内亚强烈谴责比利时帝国主义及其同盟者的颠复活动，比利时帝国主义及其同盟者通过武装干涉正试图再次影响（刚果）独立的问题。”
    这项公报表示反对在帝国主义唆使和主持下在加丹加进行的反对刚果全国统一的分裂政策。它要求联合国部队立即开入加丹加，它说，“联合国的干预，只是也只能是在毫不含糊地真诚和彻底执行安全理事会的决议的严格范围内才有理由。”如果哈马舍尔德拒绝或迟延在安理会“委托的使命的范围内”把联合国军派往加丹加省的话，几内亚政府“将根据非洲团结一致的精神立即把全部几内亚的武装部队完全提供给刚果共和国政府支配，以便保障刚果的领土完整”。
    这项公报还对正在为争取自己的独立而英勇斗争的阿尔及利亚人民表示充分的和完全的支持；谴责南非联邦政府的种族隔离政策，并向仍处于外国统治之下的一切国家的人民的解放斗争表示敬意和支持。
    同一天，加纳总统恩克鲁玛就刚果局势在阿克拉举行的记者招待会上说，“任何解决（刚果加丹加省问题的）办法，只能以一切比利时军队立即无条件撤退为基础”。他说，非洲国家“不会允许在非洲中心产生一个为比利时军队维持的并且符合一个国际矿业公司需要的傀儡国家”。
    恩克鲁玛表示，如果联合国不能解决加丹加问题的话，加纳愿意提供“刚果共和国可能要求的那种军事援助”。
    为了在联合国安全理事会7日讨论刚果局势的会议上申述刚果的意见，刚果副总理基赞加已经在6日率领一个刚果政府代表团离开利奥波德维尔前往纽约。基赞加在动身之前发表的声明中，指责哈马舍尔德采取了一项有利于企图分裂加丹加的冲伯集团的方针。
    刚果政府一位发言人6日说，刚果不再了解联合国的态度。他又说，“至于刚果人民，他们认为哈马舍尔德和本奇已经被加丹加的百万富翁收买了。”
    新华社7日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：一群刚果青年今天在刚果首都利奥波德维尔的比利时大使馆前举行示威，抗议比利时殖民军侵占刚果的领土。示威者高呼口号，要求比利时军队滚出刚果和关闭比利时大使馆。随后，他们又前往联合国在刚果的总部前面示威。
    消息说，当刚果青年在示威游行时，那里的联合国军采取了“警戒”措施。
    刚果加丹加省反对党巴卢巴卡特党领袖之一姆旺巴·伊伦戈6日发表谈话，也要求比利时殖民者离开，并抗议该省省长冲伯在比利时殖民者支持下进行把加丹加省从刚果分裂出去的阴谋活动。这个党和它的联盟在加丹加省省议会的议员，为了抗议冲伯集团搞加丹加省“独立”的阴谋，曾经在早些时候退出省议会会场。
    比利时殖民者和冲伯集团因此加紧对这个党进行镇压。据报道，5日晚上，一支由比利时军官指挥的“宪兵”袭击了这个党在伊利沙伯维尔的党部，捣毁了办公室的家具和窗户，并逮捕了这个党的三十五名党员，到6日上午才释放他们。据伊伦戈说，这是几星期以来的第三次袭击。
    比利时正继续在加丹加省部署军队。5日晚上，它又把第十二步兵营四百五十五名士兵从加米纳基地调到伊利沙伯维尔以加强那里比利时占领军的兵力。消息表明，比利时伞兵严密控制着那里的机场。
    新华社7日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：在比利时殖民军队卵翼下从事分裂活动的刚果加丹加省省长冲伯6日在这个省的首府伊利沙伯维尔宣布，他已经指示正在比利时首都布鲁塞尔活动的一个加丹加“代表团”马上到纽约去，以参加联合国安全理事会定于7日举行的关于刚果问题的讨论。
    冲伯还说，如果能够的话，他自己也要去纽约。
    另据报道，这个加丹加“代表团”的团长基布韦已在7日抵纽约。
