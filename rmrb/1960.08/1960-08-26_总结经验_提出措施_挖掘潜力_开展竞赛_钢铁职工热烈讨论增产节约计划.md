Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan:

    Tangshan Steel Plant workers, based on a summary of production in the first seven months of this year, have formulated production increase and savings plans for the next four months. They are enthusiastically launching production increase and savings competitions. Currently, the plant's production level has significantly increased. From August 11th to 18th, the daily steel output increased by 18.91% compared to the first ten days of the month, the steel qualification rate increased by 1.37%, and the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel decreased by 5.3%.
    When examining the implementation of production plans for the first seven months, workshops throughout the steel plant generally adopted the method of both airing views and analyzing and summarizing high-yield experiences, striving to tap the potential for increased production and savings. According to the examination, the plant's production level from January to July this year increased by 1.2 times compared to last year, but the leap-forward levels of various furnaces and teams were not balanced enough. Some furnaces and teams improved faster, while others were slower. After the examination, the key problems of units with slower improvement rates were identified, which further boosted the fighting spirit of the workers in these units, who proposed learning from advanced units. On this basis, the Party committee handed the production increase plan for the last four months to the masses for discussion. Each workshop and team formulated monthly and ten-day production increase and savings targets and specific measures.
    In order to ensure the realization of the production increase targets, all workshops are strengthening production preparation work and striving to promote advanced experiences. The Second Steelmaking Workshop has established an indicator chart system to plan converter production systematically. In addition, dedicated personnel are responsible for production preparation work. The First Steelmaking Workshop has summarized and promoted twelve advanced experiences related to technology and management. Various workshops are also focusing on management to adapt to the needs of production development. In terms of savings, all workshops have also taken measures. The furnace repair section of the First Steelmaking Workshop has adopted a hot repair method for converters based on the specific situation, which can not only save refractory materials but also save transportation manpower. All workshops are also preparing to implement a team material quota management system to further reduce the consumption of raw materials.
    While formulating the production increase and savings plans, workers throughout the plant launched a vigorous production increase and savings competition. In recent days, teams competed with teams, furnaces with furnaces, and individuals with individuals, seeking opponents and launching competitions. Each process in the First Steelmaking Workshop launched a "hundred furnaces without rejects" competition. Currently, seven of the fifteen converter teams in the entire workshop have achieved the "hundred furnaces without rejects" target.

  Changsha Steelmaking Enterprises
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha: Workers on the steelmaking front in Changsha City, Hunan Province, enthusiastically launched a labor competition, resulting in a rapid increase in steel production. From August 1st to 18th, the city's average daily steel output increased by 5.1% compared to the same period last month, the qualification rate of steel ingots increased by 2.2%, and the consumption of iron and coke decreased.
    Through airing views, debates, detailed accounting, and potential tapping, workers in steelmaking enterprises throughout the city formulated monthly, ten-day, and daily production plans for factories, workshops, teams, and furnaces, and established concrete measures to ensure the completion of the plans. Teams launched a competition to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward. Workers in the steelmaking workshop of Changsha General Machinery Plant, through discussing plans and launching a "compare, learn, catch up, and help" competition, increased steel production from August 1st to 18th by one times compared to the same period last month.
    Recently, the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China transferred 150 cadres to form 25 working groups, led by leading comrades of the Municipal Committee, to go deep into steel production workshops and teams to attack key production problems with the workers. Factory-level and workshop cadres in steelmaking units throughout the city all went to work in teams. Liu Liangji, deputy director of Dongfeng Steel Plant, went to the furnace lining workshop to build furnace linings with the workers and found that the operating techniques for building and striking furnace linings were not perfect, which was an important reason why the converter furnace life was not long. Therefore, he and the workers summarized operating experience and formulated three operating procedures, which were vigorously implemented. As a result, the furnace lining life was increased from the original 22 to 26 heats to 32 to 36 heats, thereby increasing steel production.

  Huaihai Steel Plant
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Workers at the Huaihai Steel Plant in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, recently reviewed and summarized the implementation of the national plan for the first seven months, formulated production increase and savings plans for the next five months of this year at all levels, boosted revolutionary energy, launched a high-quality, high-yield, and economical movement, and increased the production of more high-quality pig iron. The pig iron production plan for the first half of August has been overfulfilled, and the production qualification rate has reached 97.68%.
    In early August, the Party Committee of Huaihai Steel Plant publicized the excellent situation and the great significance of increasing pig iron production to all the workers in the plant. The workers comprehensively reviewed and summarized the production from January to July. From the plant level to each blast furnace and each team, production increase and savings plans were formulated at all levels for the next four months; in particular, clear targets and concrete measures to achieve these targets were put forward for each ten-day period in the last one and a half months of the third quarter. The plant's measures are: first, leaders at all levels should go to the front of the furnace and eat, live, work, and discuss with the workers, solve key production problems, start from the first shift and the first furnace, and achieve furnace-by-furnace research, shift-by-shift inspection, daily analysis, and ten-day evaluation. Second, strengthen enterprise management, especially technical management, summarize the production experience of small blast furnaces, and promote it among all the workers in the plant. Third, formulate technical revolution plans, promote 37 effective advanced experiences throughout the plant, and accelerate the technical transformation of small blast furnaces. Fourth, strengthen equipment maintenance, repair, and parts manufacturing, and do a good job in logistics.
    After the plan was formulated, a competition between opponents was launched between furnaces and furnaces, teams and teams, groups and groups, and people and people throughout the plant, and workers in various types of work launched a one-dragon collaborative competition. For example, Class B of Furnace No. 5 produced 17 tons of pig iron, and the other two shifts strived to catch up. The next day, the output of Class A reached the level of Class B, and the output of Class C also approached Class B; the workers of Class B were not proud and not complacent, took the strengths of others to make up for their own weaknesses, and created a new record of 19 tons of production per shift. Due to the concerted efforts of the three shifts of workers, the production of this blast furnace has been steadily increasing.

  Taiyuan Iron & Steel Youth Blast Furnace
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: Workers at the Taiyuan Iron & Steel Company Youth Blast Furnace, which has won the national blast furnace utilization coefficient championship many times, put forward the slogan "Boost Energy, Strive for Upward Mobility, High Daily Output; Catch Up with Benxi, Surpass Shijingshan, Win the Red Flag Again." On the basis of reviewing and summarizing the production situation from January to July, they formulated production increase and savings plans for August and September.
    The Taiyuan Iron & Steel Youth Blast Furnace is an advanced collective that attended the 1959 National Conference of Heroes and has created a new national utilization coefficient record ten times and won the national blast furnace utilization coefficient championship six times. However, since April this year, the Benxi Iron & Steel Company Youth Blast Furnace and the Shijingshan Iron & Steel Company large blast furnace have caught up to its front. In order to quickly catch up and surpass the advanced level, recently, the leaders of the ironmaking workshop launched the workers of the Youth Blast Furnace to study and analyze the production situation in the first seven months and, using the comparison method, found the key to promoting a substantial increase in production. Focusing on the three keys of improving raw material conditions, improving operating techniques, and strengthening equipment maintenance, they formulated production increase and savings measures. Entering August, the production level of the blast furnace has been increasing steadily. The average daily output from the 1st to the 18th increased by 22.7% compared to July, the pig iron qualification rate increased by 8.46%, the utilization coefficient increased from about 1.7 in July and remained above two tons, and the coke consumption per ton of pig iron decreased by 131 kilograms compared to July, achieving new achievements in overall leap forward.

    总结经验　提出措施　挖掘潜力　开展竞赛
    钢铁职工热烈讨论增产节约计划
    唐山钢厂
    据新华社唐山讯　唐山钢厂职工在总结今年前七个月生产的基础上，制订了今后四个多月的增产节约计划。热烈开展了增产节约竞赛。目前，全厂生产水平已有显著增长。8月11至18日，钢的日产量比上旬提高了18.91％，钢的合格率提高了1.37％，每吨钢的生铁消耗降低了5.3％。
    这个钢厂的各个车间在检查前七个月生产计划执行情况时，普遍采取了边鸣放、边分析、边总结高产经验的办法，努力挖掘增产节约的潜力。根据检查，全厂今年1至7月份里生产水平比去年提高了一点二倍，但是，各个炉子和小组的跃进水平却不够平衡。有的炉子、小组提高得较快，有的炉子、小组较慢。经过检查找出了提高速度较慢单位的关键问题，进一步鼓舞了这些单位职工们的斗志，纷纷提出要向先进单位学习。在这个基础上，党委又把后四个月的增产计划交给群众讨论。各个车间和小组都按月、按旬制定了增产节约指标和具体措施。
    为了保证增产指标的实现，各车间都在加强生产准备工作和努力推广先进经验。第二炼钢车间建立了指示图表制度，有计划地安排转炉生产。并且抽出专人负责生产准备工作。第一炼钢车间已经总结和推广了十二项有关技术和管理方面的先进经验，各车间还狠抓管理工作，适应生产发展的需要。在节约方面，各车间也都采取了措施。第一炼钢车间修炉工段根据具体情况，对转炉实行热补的办法，不仅可以节约耐火材料，还能节省运输力量。各车间还准备实行小组材料定额管理制度，进一步降低原料和材料的消耗。
    在制定增产节约计划的同时，全厂职工开展了热火朝天的增产节约竞赛。连日以来，小组与小组、炉与炉、个人与个人，互找对手，开展竞赛。第一炼钢车间各工序都开展了“百炉无废品”的竞赛。现在，全车间十五个转炉小组，有七个小组达到了百炉无废品的指标。
  长沙炼钢企业
    据新华社长沙讯　湖南省长沙市炼钢战线职工，热烈开展劳动竞赛，使钢产量迅速上升。8月1日到18日，全市钢的平均日产量比上月同期增长5.1％，钢锭合格率提高2.2％，铁和焦炭的消耗量都有下降。
    全市炼钢企业的职工，通过鸣放辩论、算细账、挖潜力，纷纷制订了厂、车间、班组、炉子的月、旬、日生产计划，订出了保证完成计划的具体措施，班组之间开展了比先进、学先进、赶先进、帮后进的竞赛。长沙通用机械厂炼钢车间工人通过讨论计划，开展“比、学、赶、帮”竞赛，使8月1日至18日的钢产量比上月同期增长了一倍。
    最近，中共长沙市委抽调了一百五十名干部，组成二十五个工作组，由市委的领导同志率领，深入钢铁生产车间、班组，与工人一道猛攻生产关键。全市炼钢单位厂级和车间干部，都到班组跟班劳动。东风钢厂副厂长刘良吉到炉衬车间和工人一起筑炉衬，发现筑打炉衬的操作技术不够完善，是转炉炉龄不长的重要原因之一；于是和工人一道总结了操作经验，订出三项操作规程，大力贯彻，结果使炉衬寿命由原来二十二炉次至二十六炉次，提高到三十二炉次至三十六炉次，因而提高了钢产量。
    淮海钢铁厂
    据新华社南京讯　江苏省徐州市淮海钢铁厂职工，最近检查总结了前七个月执行国家计划的情况，层层制订了今年后五个月的增产节约计划，鼓足革命干劲，开展优质高产节约运动，增产更多质量好的生铁。8月上半月的生铁生产计划已经超额完成，生产合格率达到97.68％。
    8月上旬，淮海钢铁厂党委向全厂职工宣传了大好形势和增产生铁的重大意义。职工们全面地检查总结了1至7月份的生产。全厂从厂级到每座高炉、每个班组，层层订出了今后四个多月的增产节约计划；特别是对第三季内后一个半月的每旬的生产，都提出了明确的指标，以及实现这些指标的具体措施。全厂的措施是：第一、各级领导干部到炉前，和工人群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，解决生产关键，从第一班第一炉抓起，做到炉炉研究，班班检查，天天分析，按旬评比。第二、加强企业管理，特别是加强技术管理，总结小高炉生产经验，在全厂职工中推广。第三、制订技术革命方案，在全厂推广三十七项行之有效的先进经验，并加速小高炉技术改造。第四、加强设备的维护、检修和配件的制造，做好后勤工作。
    在计划制订以后，全厂炉与炉、班与班、组与组、人与人之间，开展了对手赛，各工种工人开展了一条龙协作赛。如五号炉乙班班产生铁十七吨，其他两班奋起直追。第二天甲班的产量达到乙班的水平，丙班的产量也接近了乙班；乙班工人不骄傲，不自满，取人的长处补自己的短处，又创班产十九吨的新纪录。由于三班工人齐心协力，这座高炉的生产一直稳步上升。
  太钢青年高炉
    据新华社太原讯　多次获得全国高炉利用系数冠军的太原钢铁公司青年高炉的职工，提出“鼓干劲，争上游，日日高产；赶本溪，超石钢，再夺红旗”的口号，在检查总结1至7月份生产情况的基础上，制定了8、9月的增产节约计划。
    太钢青年高炉是出席1959年全国群英会的先进集体，曾经十次创造全国利用系数新纪录，六次夺得全国高炉利用系数的冠军。但是从今年4月份以来，本溪钢铁公司青年高炉和石景山钢铁公司大型高炉都赶到了它的前面。为了迅速赶上并超过先进水平，最近炼铁车间领导发动青年高炉的职工研究与分析了头七个月生产情况，并以对比的方法，找出促使生产大幅度增长的关键。他们针对改善原料状况、改进操作技术、加强设备维护三大关键，制订了增产节约措施。进入8月，高炉的生产水平节节上升，1日至18日的平均日产量比7月份提高了22.7％，生铁合格率提高了8.46％，利用系数由7月份的一点七左右提高并保持在两吨以上，每吨生铁的焦炭消耗量比7月降低了一百三十一公斤，获得了全面跃进的新成就。（附图片）
    天津第二钢厂，8月上半月创高产、优质、低耗优异成绩，和7月同期比较，钢产量增长45.1％；钢的合格率提高3.2％；每吨钢的生铁消耗量平均降低一百四十一公斤　　新华社记者　张映华摄
