Agricultural Cooperatives are a Red Flag in the Rural Areas of Northern Vietnam
Vietnam, Meng Xiong

The agricultural collectivization movement in Vietnam did not begin recently; it started as early as the August Revolution of 1945. At that time, it took the form of low-level mutual aid cooperative groups, production teams, and labor exchange teams. Therefore, throughout the entire war of resistance, Vietnamese farmers helped each other, fully utilizing their enthusiasm to overcome all difficulties in agricultural production, ensuring the Vietnamese military and civilians were self-sufficient in food, and defeating the enemy.

After the restoration of peace, during the period of agricultural production recovery in Northern Vietnam, various elementary cooperative forms and labor exchange teams were consolidated and developed along with the land reform. Some pilot cooperatives were also established. This was an important factor in creating favorable conditions for the rapid recovery of agricultural production and ensuring that grain production by the end of 1957 significantly exceeded pre-war levels.

From the beginning of 1958, on the basis of the success of land reform and the victory of economic recovery, Northern Vietnam entered a period of implementing a three-year plan to transform and develop the economy and develop culture.

In order to continuously develop production, it is necessary to concentrate manpower, funds, land, and means of production, improve technology, apply new techniques, and increase labor efficiency, constantly increasing agricultural output and yield per unit area, thereby improving and raising the people's living standards and promoting the development of other sectors such as economy and culture. Therefore, agricultural collectivization has become an urgent demand of the peasant masses and agricultural production.

From 1958 to the present, the development of the agricultural collectivization movement in Northern Vietnam has been rapid and healthy, and is now becoming increasingly consolidated.

Regarding the number of agricultural production cooperatives, there were only forty-four pilot cooperatives at the end of 1957. By the end of June 1960, there were 34,585 agricultural production cooperatives, with peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for 55% of the total number of peasant households in Northern Vietnam, including more than 2,000 advanced cooperatives. Currently, the collectivization movement is developing in depth, and the agricultural production cooperatives are becoming increasingly consolidated. By the end of 1960, the collectivization of elementary cooperatives will be basically completed in the rural areas of Northern Vietnam, and some elementary cooperatives will be upgraded to advanced cooperatives.

In the past few years, agricultural production cooperatives have played a backbone, exemplary, and leading role in guaranteeing the completion of tasks, attracting the broad participation of the peasant masses in the movement to improve farming techniques, the water conservancy movement, the movement to accumulate and apply more fertilizer, as well as deep plowing and close planting, prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, and improvement of agricultural implements, enabling agricultural output and yield per unit area in Northern Vietnam to rapidly increase to levels unprecedented in the history of Vietnamese agricultural production, far exceeding the output of the best rice harvest year of 1939 during the French colonial rule. With the development of the agricultural collectivization movement, the growth of rice output and yield per unit area is as follows:

		Total Annual Output	Average Annual Yield per Hectare
		Year	(Unit: Tons)	(Unit: Kilograms)
		1939	2,407,000	1,304
		1957	3,948,000	1,801
		1958	4,576,900	2,047
		1959	5,194,000	2,284

Through the statistics in the above table, it can be clearly seen that as the agricultural collectivization movement in Northern Vietnam develops, agricultural output and yield per unit area are also growing rapidly. By 1959, the total rice output had more than doubled (114%) compared to 1939 and increased by 31.7% compared to 1957.

Agricultural production cooperatives have clearly demonstrated the superiority of collective production over scattered small-scale peasant production. The yield per unit area of the fields of the vast majority of cooperatives has greatly exceeded that of individual farmers. At the same time, under the policy of developing diversified operations, agricultural production cooperatives, due to their concentrated strength, planned and rational use of manpower, abundant funds, and possession of more means of production, engage in many other businesses besides producing rice as the main focus: developing livestock (buffaloes, cattle, pigs, chickens, ducks, etc.) breeding, large-scale cultivation of vegetables, coarse grains, and cash crops, developing pond fish farming and field fish farming, as well as various other sideline occupations. Therefore, the income of cooperative members has been further increased, and the lives of cooperative members have been further improved and elevated in all aspects.

In the past few years, agricultural cooperatives have also actively and effectively participated in research and experimentation, contributing to the construction of the motherland's science and technology. Almost all cooperatives have planted experimental plots to experiment with deep plowing, close planting, heavy fertilization, and water management. In 1959, cooperatives planted more than 40,000 experimental plots in the summer harvest and more than 16,000 yield-increasing experimental plots in the autumn harvest; these experimental plots created thousands of typical examples of high yields per unit area and hundreds of typical examples of breaking records in yield per unit area, with some records being 7,000 kilograms, 8,000 kilograms, 9,000 kilograms, 10,000 kilograms, and 14,000 kilograms per hectare. At the same time, some local agricultural cooperatives have assisted agricultural science and technology workers in accumulating and summarizing many valuable experiences of the peasant masses, formulating a complete set of nine technical measures related to planting and four technical measures related to animal husbandry. The nine technical measures related to planting are: sufficient water, abundant fertilizer, deep plowing, close planting, good seeds, prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, improvement of agricultural implements, timely farming, and field management. The four technical measures related to animal husbandry are: full feed, good breeds, attentive care, and prevention of epidemics. The good achievements made by the cooperatives have doubled the income of the cooperative members. The income of cooperative members is usually half as much again as it was before joining the cooperative, and in many places it is almost doubled. Therefore, the lives of the peasants have been significantly improved in terms of clothing, food, housing, and they also have the opportunity to learn culture. Many cooperatives have established libraries and clubs, and some cooperatives have also bought radios to organize collective listening to news. Up to now, the hunger disasters during the lean season left over from the old system have been fundamentally eliminated, and the peasants and cooperative members are well-fed and clothed; cooperative members can all read and write, and are improving their cultural level and learning scientific knowledge about production and daily life. These facts have raised the level of consciousness of the peasants, and they are increasingly joining cooperatives on a voluntary basis, thereby making the agricultural collectivization movement increasingly vigorous and consolidated.

Although the development of the collectivization movement is rapid and healthy, and this movement has brought about a leap in agricultural production, there are also some shortcomings that affect the organization and management of the cooperatives.

Our country is overcoming these shortcomings through the following measures: strengthening ideological education, raising socialist consciousness, organizing peasants to conduct cultural and technical studies, improving their cultural level and increasing their agricultural scientific knowledge, actively training peasants, improving their level of management of cooperatives, and so on.

In short, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, after the victorious land reform, the peasants of Northern Vietnam have recognized the two paths of developing rural production and have consciously and voluntarily taken the path of collective production, actively participating in agricultural production cooperatives, making the agricultural collectivization movement to transform old relations of production and build new relations of production, namely socialist relations of production, rapidly develop and become increasingly consolidated.

In the past few years, agricultural cooperatives have often played a backbone and exemplary role in various movements such as combating natural disasters and improving farming techniques. They have mobilized and attracted the peasant masses to participate in these movements, powerfully promoting the continuous development of agricultural production, and deserve to be called the "red flag for transforming and developing agricultural production." In 1960, the collectivization of primary agricultural cooperatives will be basically completed, and some cooperatives will be upgraded to advanced cooperatives. The glorious prospect of the first five-year plan is coming, and the agricultural collectivization movement, which is steadily moving towards the advanced stage, will create favorable conditions for the semi-mechanization and mechanization of agricultural production in Northern Vietnam, enabling agricultural production to achieve even more brilliant achievements.

    农业合作社是越南北方农村的一面红旗
    越南　梦雄
    越南的农业合作化运动不是现在才有的，早在1945年八月革命成功以后即已开始，当时它是以互助合作组、生产组、变工组等低级形式出现的。因此，在整个抗战时期，越南农民互相帮助，充分发挥了自己的积极性，克服了农业生产中的一切困难，保证越南军民粮食自给自足，战胜了敌人。
    和平恢复后，越南北方在恢复农业生产时期中，随着土地改革的开展，各种初级合作形式和变工组获得巩固和发展，并且成立了一些试点合作社。这是为使农业生产迅速恢复并使1957年底粮食生产大大超过战前水平创造有利条件的重要因素之一。
    从1958年初，在土地改革成功和经济恢复胜利的基础上，越南北方进入了实现改造和发展经济、发展文化的三年计划的时期。
    为了不断发展生产，必须集中力量、资金、土地和生产工具，改进技术，运用新的技术，提高劳动效率，不断提高农业的产量和单位面积产量，借以改善和提高人民的生活水平，促进经济、文化等其他部门的发展。因此，农业合作化已成为农民群众和农业生产的一个迫切要求。
    从1958年到现在，越南北方农业合作化运动的发展是迅速、健康的，现在更日益得到有力的巩固。
    农业生产合作社的数目，1957年底只有四十四个试点合作社，到1960年6月底为止，已有三万四千五百八十五个农业生产合作社，入社农户占全北方农户总数的55％，其中有高级合作社二千多个。现在，合作化运动正在深入发展，各农业生产合作社日益巩固。到1960年底，越南北方农村将基本上完成初级社的合作化，并且使一些初级社上升为高级合作社。
    在过去几年，农业生产合作社在保证任务的完成上起了骨干、模范、带头的作用，吸引农民群众广泛参加了改进耕作技术运动、水利运动、积肥和多施肥料运动以及深耕密植、防治病虫害和改良农具等运动，使越南北方的农业产量和单位面积产量，迅速增加到越南农业生产史上从未有过的水平，远远超过法国殖民者统治时期稻谷收成最好的年份1939年的产量。随着农业合作化运动的发展，稻谷的产量和单位面积产量的增长情况如下：
            全年总产量　全年每公顷平均年　份　（单位：吨）单位面积产量（单位：公斤）1939年　2，407，000　1，3041957年　3，948，000　1，8011958年　4，576，900　2，0471959年　5，194，000　2，284
    通过上表的统计，可以清楚地看到，由于越南北方农业合作化运动日益发展，农业产量和单位面积产量也日益飞跃增长。到1959年，稻谷的总产量，比1939年增加了一倍多（114％），比1957年增加了31.7％。
    农业生产合作社已明显表现出了集体生产比分散的小农生产的优越性。绝大多数合作社的田地的单位面积产量，都大大超过了单干农民的田地。同时，在发展多种经营的方针下，农业生产合作社由于力量集中、有计划和合理地使用人力、资金充裕和拥有较多的生产工具等，除了以生产稻谷为主外，还经营许多其它业务：发展家畜（水牛、黄牛、猪、鸡、鸭……）饲养业，大种蔬菜、杂粮和经济作物，发展池塘养鱼和田间养鱼以及其他各种副业。因此，更增加了社员的收入，使社员的生活在各方面都得到进一步的改善和提高。
    农业合作社在过去几年中还积极、有效地参加了研究试验工作，对祖国科学技术的建设作出了贡献。几乎所有的合作社都种了试验田，对深耕、密植、多施肥和水的管理等进行了试验。1959年，合作社在夏收中种了四万多块试验田，在秋收中种了一万六千多块增产试验田；这些试验田创造出了成千的单位面积产量高产的典型和成百的单位面积产量破纪录的典型，有些纪录是一公顷七千公斤、八千公斤、九千公斤、一万公斤和一万四千公斤。同时，有些地方的农业社协助农业科学技术工作者积累总结了农民群众的许多宝贵经验，制订出了一整套有关种植的九点技术措施和有关畜牧的四点技术措施。有关种植的九点技术措施是：水足，肥多，深耕，密植，良种，防治病虫害，改良农具，不误农时和田间管理。有关畜牧的四点技术措施是：饱食，良种，照顾周到和防治疫病。合作社所取得的良好成就，使社员的收入倍增。社员的收入通常比入社以前增加半倍，有许多地方增加近一倍。因此，农民的生活在衣食住方面得到了显著的改善，并且还有机会学习文化。许多合作社成立了图书馆和俱乐部，一些合作社还买了收音机来组织集体收听新闻。到现在，旧制度所遗留下来的青黄不接时期的饥饿灾难已经根本消除，农民和合作社社员都是丰衣足食的；合作社社员都能读会写，并且正在提高文化水平和学习有关生产和日常生活的科学常识。这些事实提高了农民的觉悟程度，他们日益众多地、自觉自愿地加入合作社，从而使农业合作化运动日益蓬勃发展，日益巩固。
    虽然合作化运动的发展是迅速、健康的，这一运动使农业生产得到飞跃的增长，但同时还存在着一些缺点，影响到合作社的组织和管理工作。
    我国正在通过以下的措施，克服这些缺点：加强思想教育，提高社会主义觉悟，组织农民进行文化和技术学习，提高文化水平和增进农业科学知识，积极培养农民，提高他们对合作社的管理水平，等等。
    总之，在越南劳动党的领导下，越南北方农民经过胜利的土地改革，已认识到发展农村生产的两条道路，并已自觉自愿地走集体生产的道路，积极参加农业生产合作社，使改造旧生产关系、建设新生产关系即社会主义的生产关系的农业合作化运动，获得迅速发展并日益巩固。
    过去几年，农业合作社在战胜自然灾害、改进耕作技术等各个运动中，经常起着骨干和模范作用，它动员、吸引农民群众参加了这些运动，有力地推动了农业生产的不断发展，不愧为“改造和发展农业生产的红旗”。在1960年内，将要基本上完成初级农业社的合作化，并且将使一些合作社上升为高级社。第一个五年计划光辉灿烂的远景即将到来，稳步走向高级阶段的农业合作化运动，将为越南北方农业生产半机械化和机械化创造有利的条件，使农业生产取得更加辉煌的成就。（附图片）
