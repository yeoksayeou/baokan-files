    Labor is Glorious
    Ma Tieding
    Labor is glorious. When I wrote this title, I wondered: Is this title too "old"? Yes, we have always advocated that labor is glorious. Not only have we emphasized the glory of labor in the ten years since the founding of the country, but since the day Marxism appeared, we have emphasized the glory of labor. Nevertheless, the four words "Labor is Glorious" will never fade and will never be "outdated." Isn't the literary and art world discussing eternal themes? I think: labor is the most important eternal theme in literary creation. Class society cannot exist without labor, non-class society cannot exist without labor, and no form of society can exist without labor!
    One of the marks of transitioning to a communist society is the elimination of the difference or boundary between manual and mental labor. The way to do this is: to intellectualize the working people and to have intellectuals engage in labor. That is, people engaged in manual labor simultaneously engage in mental labor, and people engaged in mental labor simultaneously engage in manual labor. This is a major event related to socialist construction and the transition to communism, and it should not be taken lightly.
    The vast number of young students in our country not only write that labor is glorious in their graduation application forms, and talk about labor being glorious in discussion meetings, but also truly practice it, taking the four words "labor is glorious" as a guide for their actions. Wang Peizhen in Tianjin is one example, and Jing Huanyun in Zhengzhou is another example. They are both high school graduates and have participated in agricultural labor. Labor helps them transform their thinking; labor enriches their perceptual knowledge; their scientific and cultural knowledge, once combined with labor practice, immediately shines brilliantly, and it can even be said that only when combined with labor practice can it shine brilliantly. Wang Peizhen and Jing Huanyun are new-style farmers, farmers with ideals and scientific and cultural knowledge. They should play, and indeed do play, a backbone role, a bridge role, and a leading role in the countryside.
    People's level of awareness always comes sooner or later, unevenly. A very small number of young intellectual friends are not like Wang Peizhen and Jing Huanyun. Although they write that labor is glorious and talk about labor being glorious, when it comes to truly and permanently engaging in manual labor, they hesitate. Some people think this way: "I am an educated person, do I still need to participate in manual labor?"
    No, comrade, this idea is wrong! Having cultural and scientific knowledge does not mean that you can stop doing manual labor from now on, but rather that you can labor more effectively from now on. In the future, every ordinary worker and ordinary farmer will have a cultural level equivalent to middle school or university. If everyone is detached from manual labor, then who will produce grain, produce steel, and produce other material wealth? And where will communism come from?
    To be detached from manual labor after having a little culture is the old path that class society has followed for thousands of years. What we are taking is a brand new, brand new path: mental labor and manual labor are combined together, forever combined together, so that material wealth and spiritual wealth can be enriched to an extent that no past society could have ever hoped for!
    Workers and peasants must be intellectualized, and intellectuals must be made to engage in labor; this means that everyone must become a cultured and conscious laborer. For intellectuals, Wang Peizhen and Jing Huanyun have set an example for us!
    Labor is glorious! Long live the labor of socialism and communism!

    劳动光荣
    马铁丁
    劳动光荣，当我写下这个题目的时候，我想：题目是不是过分“陈旧”呢？是的，我们历来就是提倡劳动光荣的。不但开国十年来我们强调劳动光荣，从有马克思主义学说的一天起，我们就是强调劳动光荣的。虽然如此，“劳动光荣”这四个字，却永远不会褪色，永远不会“过时”。文艺界不是在讨论永恒的主题吗？我想：劳动就是文艺创作中最最重要的永恒的主题。阶级社会离开不了劳动，非阶级社会离开不了劳动，任何形态的社会都离开不了劳动！
    过渡到共产主义社会的标志之一，是消灭体力劳动与脑力劳动的差别或界线。其办法就是：劳动人民知识化，知识分子劳动化。也就是说，从事体力劳动的人同时从事脑力劳动，从事脑力劳动的人同时从事体力劳动。这是有关社会主义建设、有关向共产主义过渡的大事，非可等闲视之的。
    我国的广大青年学生们，不但在毕业志愿书上写的是劳动光荣，在讨论会上讲的是劳动光荣，而且真正地身体力行，把劳动光荣四个字作为自己行动的指南。天津市的王培珍是一个例子，郑州市的荆焕云又是一个例子，她们都是高中毕业生，都参加了农业劳动。劳动，帮助她们改造思想；劳动，丰富她们的感性知识；她们的科学文化知识，一经与劳动实践结合，就立即放出异彩来，甚至可以说，只有与劳动实践结合，才能放出异彩来。王培珍、荆焕云们是新式的农民，是有理想、有文化科学知识的农民，她们在农村中理应起着、而且果然起着骨干作用、桥梁作用、带头作用。
    人的觉悟程度总是有先有后，参差不齐的。有极小一部分知识青年朋友们并不像王培珍、荆焕云那样，虽然他们写的是劳动光荣，讲的是劳动光荣，但是，一到要真正地、长期地从事体力劳动时，他们就却步了。有的人这样想：“我是一个有文化的人，还需要参加体力劳动吗？”
    不，同志，这种想法错矣！有了文化科学知识，并不是说可以从此不要体力劳动，而是说，可以从此更有成效地去劳动。将来每一个普通工人、普通农民都要有中学或大学水平的文化程度，如果个个都脱离了体力劳动，那么，又有谁去生产粮食、生产钢铁、生产其他物质财富呢？又哪来共产主义呢？
    有了一点文化，就脱离体力劳动，那是几千年阶级社会所走过来的老道。我们所走的是一条崭新、崭新的新路：脑力劳动与体力劳动结合在一起，永远结合在一起，使物质财富与精神财富以过去任何社会所望尘莫及的速度极大地丰富起来！
    工人农民必须知识化，知识分子必须劳动化；这就是每个人都要成为有文化有觉悟的劳动者。对知识分子说，王培珍、荆焕云替我们树立了榜样！
    劳动光荣！社会主义、共产主义的劳动万岁！
