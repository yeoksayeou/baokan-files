    Produce More Vehicles
    With increased steel production, transportation must take the lead. The railway department is the main force on the transportation front. In the next five months, steel production will inevitably continue to rise at an even greater rate, and the volume of transportation will increase accordingly. Therefore, we must now do everything possible to improve the utilization rate of existing lines and transportation equipment, and strive to find ways to increase new transport capacity. Increasing vehicle production is an important aspect of increasing transport capacity. With more locomotives and vehicles, we can transport more coal, more ore, more pig iron, and more other materials, so that the increase in steel production can be more strongly supported.
    From the perspective of needs, the more locomotives and vehicles produced, the better. However, the materials for manufacturing locomotives and vehicles are limited. In this case, should we only produce as many vehicles as possible according to the materials supplied by the state and the old quotas? Or should we seek transport capacity through technological revolution and produce more vehicles with limited materials? Undoubtedly, the promotion faction will choose the latter path.
    The several locomotive and vehicle manufacturing factories that we are publishing today are such promotion factions. For example, the Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant was supplied with materials from the state in June to manufacture 180 freight cars, but through hard work in increasing production and practicing economy, they produced more than 500 freight cars. The Dalian Locomotive Plant mobilized the masses to carry out a product revolution. The materials originally used to make nine locomotives can now produce ten locomotives while ensuring quality. The Shijiazhuang Rolling Stock Plant reformed the processing methods and saved more than 2,500 tons of various steel materials in the first half of this year, using these materials to produce 158 more freight cars for the state. These examples show that products such as locomotives and freight cars, which use a large amount of raw materials, have great potential for saving raw materials. It is hoped that all locomotive and vehicle manufacturing factories across the country will learn from these advanced examples, launch a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, better utilize and improve the achievements of the technological revolution, and strive to deliver more and better locomotives and vehicles to the lines in the shortest possible time.

    多造车辆
    钢铁增产，运输先行。铁道部门更是运输战线的主力。今后五个月，钢铁产量必然会以更大的幅度持续上升，运输量也会相应地加大，因此，目前我们应当千方百计地提高现有线路和运输设备的利用率，并且努力设法增加新的运力。增产车辆，是增加运力的一个重要方面，有了更多的机车车辆，就能装运更多的煤，更多的矿石，更多的生铁，以及更多的其他物资，钢铁的增产就可以得到更加有力的支持。
    从需要来看，机车车辆是增产得越多越好。但是，制造机车车辆的材料却有一定限度。在这种情况下，是仅仅按照国家供应的材料，按照旧定额，能生产几辆就生产几辆呢？还是向技术革命要运力，用有限的材料生产更多的车辆呢？无疑，促进派一定选择后一条路。
    今天我们发表的几个制造机车、车辆的工厂，就是这样的促进派。例如沈阳机车车辆厂六月份国家供应他们制造一百八十辆货车的材料，但是他们努力增产节约，竟生产了五百多辆货车。大连机车厂发动群众大搞产品革命，原来做九台机车的材料，在保证质量的情况下，现在能生产十台机车。石家庄车辆厂改革加工方法，今年上半年共节约各种钢铁材料二千五百多吨，用这些材料为国家多生产了一百五十八辆货车。这些事例说明，像机车和货车这类使用原材料较多的产品，节约原材料的潜力是很大的。希望全国所有制造机车车辆的工厂，学习这些先进的榜样，开展一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，更好地运用和提高技术革命的成果，争取在尽量短的时间内，把更多更好的机车车辆送到线路上去。
