Supporting Agriculture, Promoting Industry
    Jinan Diesel Engine Plant Completes First Half Production Tasks Ahead of Schedule and Above Quota

    (Our report) The Jinan Diesel Engine Plant in Shandong Province, establishing the idea of agriculture as the foundation among its employees, launched a mass movement of industry supporting agriculture. In the past six months, it not only overfulfilled the annual production task of irrigation and drainage machinery, but also, through activities supporting agriculture, raised the political consciousness of its employees. Technological innovation and technological revolution movements have been widely and deeply carried out, powerfully promoting the overall leap forward in the plant's production.

    This factory has conducted relatively thorough ideological education on supporting agriculture. The employees regard accelerating agricultural technological transformation as their own glorious task, thus rapidly launching a production upsurge in the whole factory centered on rushing to produce agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery. The planned output of the factory's main product—industrial diesel engines—is to increase by 84.7% compared to last year; the planned output of agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery is to increase by 4.3 times compared to last year. According to labor quotas, completing the above tasks requires increasing more than 20,000 work hours. To overcome this difficulty and ensure that the production of agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery precedes the agricultural season, the entire factory has continuously carried out four shock movements.

    According to the planned progress, the large chassis casting workshop for irrigation and drainage machinery must produce fifteen units per day. However, at that time, sandboxes and tools were insufficient, and the modeling could not keep up, so only five or six units were produced per day. The shock team composed of leading cadres, technicians, and workers, after repeated research and multiple experiments, implemented segmented modeling, segmented casting, one mold for multiple castings, and three shifts staggered, two kiln baking methods, which increased work efficiency fourfold. The assembly workshop, in order to ensure that irrigation and drainage machinery would be shipped out as soon as possible, needed to increase the daily assembly level from five units to seventeen units, but at that time, only eight units could be made each day. In order to quickly break through this weak link, employees worked hard and finally trial-produced a spherical extrusion tool, increasing work efficiency by 239 times, and overfulfilling the supporting tasks.

    In supporting agriculture, the factory's employees have promoted the communist style of the working class, leaving difficulties to themselves and providing convenience to others. They said, "No matter how busy we are, we must be busy for agriculture." For example, on June 25th, more than 10,000 work hours were still lacking to complete the monthly task of agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery. However, in order to help Liubu Commune in Licheng County overcome the drought, they still drew thirty technicians and workers to support the commune's drought resistance efforts.

    Through vigorously carrying out activities of industry supporting agriculture, this factory has powerfully promoted the overall leap forward in the entire production. Not only did it over fulfill the annual production task of 265 agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery by 5.7% in the first half of the year, but the plant's first half production plan for main products was also successfully completed by 11.5% above quota, increasing by 52.6% compared to the same period last year. The output value also exceeded the plan by 3.2%.

### 支援了农业　促进了工业  济南柴油机厂提前超额完成上半年生产任务

    支援了农业　促进了工业
    济南柴油机厂提前超额完成上半年生产任务
    本报讯　山东济南柴油机厂，在职工群众中树立起以农业为基础的思想，大搞工业支援农业的群众运动，半年来不仅超额完成全年排灌机械生产任务，而且通过支援农业的活动，提高了职工群众的政治觉悟，技术革新和技术革命运动得到了广泛深入的开展，有力地促进了全厂生产的全面跃进。
    这个工厂对支援农业的思想教育作得比较深入，职工群众把加速农业技术改造，当作自己的一项光荣任务，从而在全厂迅速掀起了以赶制农业排灌机械为中心的生产高潮。这个厂的主产品——工业用柴油机的计划产量，要比去年增长84.7％；农业排灌机械的计划产量，要比去年增加四点三倍。根据劳动定额，要完成上述任务，需要增加两万多个工时。为克服这一困难，保证农业排灌机械的生产走在农时季节前面，全厂连续开展了四次突击运动。
    按照计划进度，排灌机械的大底盘翻砂车间必须日产十五个，但是当时沙箱工具不够用，造型跟不上，每天只产五、六个。领导干部、技术人员和工人组成的突击队，经过反复研究，多次试验，实行了分段造型，分段浇铸，一模多铸和三班交错、两次烘窑的方法，使工效提高了四倍。装配车间为了保证排灌机械早日出厂，需要把每天装配水平由五台增加到十七台，但是当时每天只能制成八个。为迅速突破这一薄弱环节，职工们刻苦钻研，终于试制成了圆球挤压工具，提高工效二百三十九倍，超额完成了配套任务。
    这个厂的职工在支援农业中，发扬了工人阶级把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人的共产主义风格。他们说：“千忙万忙也要为农业忙”。如6月25日，距完成全月农业排灌机械任务尚缺一万多个工时，但是他们为了帮助历城柳埠公社战胜旱灾，仍然抽出了三十名技术人员、工人，支援公社抗旱。
    这个工厂通过大搞工业支援农业的活动，有力地促进了整个生产的全面跃进。不仅在上半年超额5.7％完成了全年农业排灌机械二百六十五台的生产任务，而全厂上半年主产品产量计划也超额11.5％胜利完成，比去年同期提高了52.6％。产值也超过计划3.2％。
