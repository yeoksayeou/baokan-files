    Praise for the "Three-Eight" Work Style
    The "Three-Eight" work style has a long history, shining brightly in revolutionary history,
    Now the flowers are blooming even redder, the wind carries the fragrance ten thousand miles across the land.　　——Soldiers' Ballad

    The "Three-Eight" work style can only be found in the people's army. Take internal unity for example: to win battles, internal unity is essential; unity is strength. The Kuomintang army also knew this principle, and they also talked nonsense about "officers caring for their brothers," but they just couldn't do it. Internally, there was insincerity, and officers and soldiers were opposed to each other, so they always lost battles. The reason is that the Kuomintang army represents the interests of landlords, capitalists, and imperialists, and it oppresses and exploits the people; while the soldiers are all poor people, and of course, they are unwilling to risk their lives for them. Our People's Liberation Army, both officers and soldiers, serve the people wholeheartedly. There is no conflict of class interests internally, so we are always as united as one person. No matter how great the difficulties, we can overcome them, and no matter how powerful the enemy, we can defeat them.
                                                                          ——Private Li Fengji

    Any of our construction must be realized through the company. The company is the basic unit for us to complete combat missions and all work. "Planting the roots of all work in the company" is the fundamental way to ensure the completion of various tasks. With deep roots and lush foliage, tall pine trees can withstand the attacks of storms and stand firm and grow vigorously, precisely because they are deeply rooted in the soil. Our leaders and cadres of the leading organs going deep into the company is precisely to make the roots of our revolutionary army's construction tree deeper, to make it absorb more water, to give it more sunshine, and to give it more abundant nourishment.
                                                                          ——Captain Xu Xuecheng

    The army is a fighting collective, and without unity, there is no combat effectiveness. Therefore, at any time, we must emphasize unity and cooperation. Only by relying on our unity, close cooperation, vigorousness, liveliness, full of drive, collective wisdom, and concerted efforts, can we creatively complete various tasks.
                                                                          ——Theoretical Research Section of a certain unit, Liu Jingchun

    The vigor of the revolutionary army is not a matter of age; the fundamental reason is that our army's officers and soldiers are united, superiors and subordinates are united, and there is full democratic life, and everyone has a high degree of revolutionary optimism. We are vigorous because we are very optimistic and very happy. Why are we optimistic? Why are we happy? Because we have lofty ideals and great hopes. We are fighting for the cause of people's liberation, and our goal is to build the most beautiful communist cause of mankind. This is our ideal. Our ideal is in line with the laws of social development, in line with the interests of all working people, and therefore is supported by the broad masses of people. We firmly believe that this ideal will surely be victorious, which is our hope. Since we firmly believe that our ideal is lofty and will surely be victorious, and firmly believe that our future is beautiful and full of hope, we are of course optimistic and happy.
                                                                          ——Deputy Section Chief of the Propaganda Section of a certain unit, Liao Xing

    三八作风赞
    三八作风源流长，革命史上放光芒，
    如今开花花更红，风吹万里遍地香。		——战士歌谣
    三八作风只有人民的军队才能有。就说内部团结吧，要打胜仗，内部必须团结，团结就是力量。这个道理国民党军队也知道，他们也瞎说什么“官长要爱护弟兄”，但是就是办不到，内部三心二意，官兵对立，所以老打败仗。原因就是国民党军队是代表地主、资本家和帝国主义利益的，是压迫、剥削人民的；而士兵都是穷苦人民，当然不愿意为他们卖命。咱们人民解放军，官和兵都是全心全意为人民服务的，内部没有阶级利益的冲突，所以永远团结得像一个人一样，再大的困难也能克服，无论多么强大的敌人也能打倒。
                    ——列兵　李逢吉
    我们任何一项建设都必须通过连队来实现，连队是我们完成作战任务和一切工作的基层单位。“把一切工作的根子扎在连队”，正是保证完成各种任务的根本途径。根深叶茂，高大的松树能够经得住狂风暴雨的袭击而屹立不摇，并且茁壮地成长，正是因为它深深扎根于泥土之中。我们领导机关的首长和干部，深入连队，到连队去，也正是为了使我们革命军队建设的大树根子扎得更深，使它吸收更多的水，给它更多的阳光，给它更充足的养分。
                                ——大尉　徐学成
    部队是一个战斗的集体，没有团结就没有战斗力。所以，在任何时候，我们都要大讲团结，大搞协作。只有依靠我们的团结一致，紧密协作，朝气勃勃，生动活泼，干劲十足，群策群力，我们才能创造性地完成各项任务。
                              ——某部理论研究科　刘景醇
    革命军队的活泼，不是什么年龄大小的问题，根本的原因，是我们部队官兵一致，上下一致，有充分的民主生活，每个人都有高度的革命乐观主义精神。我们活泼，因为我们非常乐观，非常愉快。为什么乐观？为什么愉快？因为我们有崇高的理想，有远大的希望。我们是为人民解放事业而奋斗的，我们的目标是建设人类最美好的共产主义事业，这就是我们的理想。我们这个理想是符合社会发展规律、符合全体劳动人民利益的，因而受到广大人民的拥护和支持。我们深信这个理想必然能够胜利，这就是我们的希望。我们既然深信自己的理想是崇高的，必然胜利的，深信我们的前途是美好的，大有希望的，我们当然乐观、愉快。
                      ——某部宣传科副科长　廖　星
