    Touré Calls for Helping the Congolese People Drive Out the Aggressors
    Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, August 3rd: According to a report from the Guinean Broadcasting Station, the President of the Republic of Guinea, Sékou Touré, said on August 2nd that it is necessary to help the Congolese people drive the enemies of Congolese independence and sovereignty out of Congolese territory.
    He said that the situation in the Congo is inseparable from the situation in all other newly independent African countries. Imperialists possess their own military forces and trusts everywhere in Africa. If the Congo cannot save the honor of Africa, it will be an encouragement to imperialism, which will then repeat in the Mali Federation, the Ivory Coast, Dahomey, or elsewhere, what it has already done in the Congo.

    杜尔呼吁帮助刚果人民赶走侵略者
    新华社科纳克里3日电　据几内亚广播电台报道，几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔2日说，必须帮助刚果人民把刚果独立和主权的敌人从刚果领土赶出去。
    他说，刚果的局势是同新近获得独立的所有其它非洲国家的局势分不开的。帝国主义者在非洲到处都拥有自己的军事力量和托辣斯。如果刚果不能挽救非洲的荣誉，那将是对帝国主义的一种鼓励，它就会再在马里联邦、象牙海岸、达荷美或其它地方重演在刚果已经做的那一套。
