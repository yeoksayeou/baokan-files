The mass swimming activities launched in provinces and cities across the country have now reached a climax. From the Songhua River to the shores of the South China Sea, aquatic athletes swim in rivers, lakes, and seas, strengthening their bodies, enlivening their lives, and promoting production.

Currently, relevant departments in sixteen provinces, including Sichuan, Hebei, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, and Zhejiang, and six cities, including Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Dalian, have jointly issued notices to widely carry out swimming activities. Among them, fourteen provinces and six cities have decided to hold province-wide (city-wide) river-crossing and sea-swimming competitions. Hubei Province plans to organize ten million people to participate in swimming activities this year. Zhejiang Province plans to organize five million people to take to the water this year, three million people to learn to swim, ten thousand people to reach the standard of swimming athletes, ten thousand people to reach the standard of swimming referees, and ten thousand people to reach the standard of swimming coaches. At present, the number of young people participating in swimming in this province has reached two million. In Tianjin, 600,000 people have participated in swimming, and in Chongqing, 500,000 people have participated. In Harbin City, located in northern China, swimming enthusiasts began swimming in early June. The swimming pool on the Songhua River also opened more than half a month earlier than in previous years. On the first day of opening, more than 10,000 militiamen participated in swimming and held the first 10,000-person cross-Songhua River competition.

Competition activities are very active in the swimming activities carried out in various places. Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality broke the superstition that the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are too rapid and turbulent to cross, and held the first Yangtze River crossing swimming competition on June 19. More than 90% of the athletes participating in the competition crossed the Yangtze River for the first time. Jiangsu Province held a Yangtze River crossing swimming competition in Nanjing City on July 30, with 480 participants. Guilin City, with a population of only 200,000, has had more than 45,000 people participate in swimming since the beginning of summer, and on June 12, it organized the first competition of more than 3,000 people to swim along the Li River and across the Li River. Some areas have also organized symbolic swimming competitions and correspondence competitions. Starting in July, Zhejiang Province organized twenty-seven swimming correspondence competitions. Guangzhou City launched a symbolic relay swimming activity. In one month, more than 300 swimming teams and more than 50,000 people participated in this activity.

The characteristics of swimming activities carried out in various places this year are: swimming activities are combined with sanitation work, militia training, and military camping activities. Some include swimming as one of the contents of militia training and military camping. In Baiyangdian Commune, Xushui County, Hebei Province, in order to inherit the glorious tradition and excellent swimming skills of the old militia Wild Goose Team in Baiyangdian fighting against the Japanese devils, a new Wild Goose swimming training team was formed in conjunction with militia training. At present, 95% of the young people in the commune have participated in swimming.

Party committees in various places attach great importance to the development of swimming activities and personally lead this activity. Many leading comrades in provinces and cities also actively take the lead in participating in swimming. Under the direct leadership of the Party committees, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Harbin established swimming headquarters or steering committees.

    广大群众泛游江河湖海
    在全国各省、市开展的群众性游泳活动，目前已进入高潮。从松花江到南海之滨，水上健儿泛游江、河、湖、海，增强体质，活跃生活，推动生产。
    现在，四川、河北、福建、湖北、湖南、浙江等十六个省，上海、天津、广州、旅大等六个市的有关部门，早已联合发出广泛开展游泳活动的通知。其中，有十四个省、六个市，决定举行全省（市）的渡江游海游泳比赛活动。湖北省打算今年组织一千万人参加游泳活动。浙江省今年计划组织五百万人下水，三百万人学会游泳，一万人达到游泳等级运动员标准，一万人达到等级裁判标准，一万人达到游泳教练员标准。目前，这个省参加游泳的青少年，已达二百万人。天津市参加游泳的已达六十万人，重庆市已达五十万人。处于我国北方的哈尔滨市的青少年，在6月初，热爱游泳的人就已经下水。松花江的游泳场也比往年提前半个多月开放。开放的第一天，就有一万多名民兵参加游泳，并首次举行了万人横渡松花江的比赛。
    在各地开展的游泳活动中，比赛活动十分活跃。四川省暨重庆市破除历年来认为长江上游水急浪大、不能横渡的迷信，于6月19日举行了第一次横渡长江游泳比赛。参加比赛的运动员90％以上是第一次横渡长江。江苏省于7月30日在南京市举行了有四百八十人参加的横渡长江的游泳比赛。仅有二十万人口的桂林市，入夏以来，已有四万五千多人参加了游泳，并于6月12日第一次组织了三千多人参加的漫游漓江、横渡漓江的比赛。有些地区还组织了象征性的游泳比赛和通讯比赛。从7月份开始，浙江省组织了二十七个项目的游泳通讯比赛。广州市开展了象征性的接力游泳活动，在一个月时间中，就有三百多个游泳队，五万多人参加这一活动。
    今年各地开展游泳活动的特点是：游泳活动与卫生工作、民兵训练、军事野营活动相结合。有的将游泳列为民兵训练和军事野营的内容之一。河北省徐水县白洋淀公社，为了继承老民兵雁翎队在白洋淀打日本鬼子的光荣传统和优良的游水技术，结合民兵训练，组成了新的雁翎游泳锻炼队。目前全社已有95％的青少年参加了游泳。
    各地党委都很重视游泳活动的开展，亲自领导了这一活动。很多省、市的领导同志还积极带头参加游泳。浙江、湖南和哈尔滨市在党委直接领导下，成立了游泳总指挥部或指导委员会。
