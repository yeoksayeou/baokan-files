    Phosphorus is produced! Phosphorus is produced!
    Hubei Shashi Pesticide Factory Yellow Phosphorus Group
    Yellow phosphorus is an important raw material for manufacturing agricultural insecticides. However, the supply of yellow phosphorus is increasingly failing to meet demand. What to do? The Party branch issued a call to everyone: Fully and fiercely attack the yellow phosphorus barrier! Seven of us signed up and, under the direct leadership and support of the Party branch, formed a task force.
    All seven of us are young people, with an average age of only nineteen and a half. Three of us have some junior high school education, and the rest have only primary school education. None of us understands the technology of refining yellow phosphorus. At this time, the Party branch asked us to carry out activities using a combination of studying theory, learning technology, and tackling key problems. Our group is not only a task force, but also a study group for Mao Zedong's works, and a scientific and technological research group. We borrowed a chemistry book, looked up the composition of the ingredients and heating requirements, and then built a furnace to do experiments based on these requirements. But we failed twice in a row because the temperature was not high enough. We still persevered. Then, the branch led us to study Chairman Mao's attitude towards difficulties. Chairman Mao used the story of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains to tell us that strategically, we should despise all enemies, and tactically, we should take all enemies seriously. "Nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it." We thought, Chairman Mao led the Chinese revolution for decades. When the Great Revolution failed, he went to Jinggangshan. The white terror was so fierce and the difficulties so great, but Chairman Mao was not afraid. He persisted in the struggle and finally achieved victory. Is the difficulty we are facing now greater than what Chairman Mao encountered then? The Party branch further pointed out to us: To be able to despise difficulties strategically, we must value them tactically and deal with them seriously; otherwise, it will become empty talk.
    At this time, comrades from the factory who had gone to Nanjing for a study tour returned. However, the "small yellow phosphorus" workshop in the factory they visited was three stories high, used electric furnaces, and required large transformers, so it could not be copied directly. Just as everyone was distressed, the Party branch pointed out that scientific principles are universal. Foreign methods cannot be applied rigidly. We should use the principles of foreign equipment and take the road of indigenous methods! The branch also led us to study the story of Wang Guofan's poor stick cooperative and the story of Qiu Yulong's three cobblers in Shashi who built a tire factory in a year. If others can start from scratch, why can't we do great things with poor methods? If the temperature of the coal furnace is not high enough, why can't we build a native electric furnace! Once the mind was opened, solutions appeared. Foreign electric furnaces require steel plates for the furnace lining. We don't have steel plates, but we have plenty of ceramic jars and pots. We used a large water tank to replace the steel plate and used firebricks to replace the carbon plate under the steel plate. After a day's effort, we finally built the native electric furnace.
    The electric furnace was energized, and we took turns on duty by the furnace with anxious hearts. Four hours later, the first slag came out. The comrade who returned from the visit took one look and said, "It's the same as in Nanjing!" Everyone was overjoyed. Then, smoke came out of the phosphorus gas pipe on the top of the furnace, and the air was filled with the smell of yellow phosphorus. Everyone was extremely happy. Just as we were applauding, there was a "bang" and the furnace exploded. The top of the furnace was blown open, and the shed was filled with smoke.
    The furnace exploded, but our yellow phosphorus production plan did not "explode." Everyone sat down on the spot to study, believing that phosphorus vapor had already come out, and the phosphorus fire had already been ignited. This means that we are already close to victory. Failure is the mother of success. The explosion can help us discover the problem and find ways to improve it. The question now is: Are we afraid, and can we persevere? Everyone said: If we are afraid, we wouldn't have come. Since we came, we are not afraid! So we studied the cause, repaired the furnace, and continued the experiment seven times in a row, finally finding the cause of the explosion step by step.
    After many experiments, solid phosphorus had not yet been extracted, but at night, the ground and puddles around the furnace were flashing with phosphorescence everywhere. It turned out that we did not use a circulating device for the water used to cool and wash the phosphorus vapor, and the yellow phosphorus ran off with the water. After adopting a circulating water device, this problem was solved, but the yellow phosphorus and water were still mixed together and could not be separated. The comrade who returned from the visit to Nanjing said that there should also be a heating and stirring process. We immediately followed suit. On "May Fourth" Youth Day, the leaders wanted us to rest, but none of us wanted to leave. The factory organized young people to go out for fun, but none of us wanted to go. We thought: On this day forty-one years ago, the older generation of young people in Beijing raised the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism and carried out a heroic struggle against the enemy. Today, we want to commemorate it with selfless labor. We want to use the solid phosphorus refined by our own hands to present a gift to the Party. We worked until 11:00 a.m., and the phosphorus water was still a muddy yellow, indistinguishable from water and yellow phosphorus. After eating, Zhang Yonghou was the first to run back. He put on rubber gloves and felt a raised object at the bottom of the tank. He scooped it up and saw that it was a piece of solid phosphorus! He scooped again, and a large yellow chunk was scooped up. "Phosphorus is produced! Phosphorus is produced!" Hearing his shout, everyone ran over. The excitement was beyond description!

    出磷了！出磷了！
    湖北沙市农药厂黄磷小组
    黄磷是制造农用杀虫剂的重要原料。可是黄磷的供应越来越赶不上需要。怎么办？党支部向大家发出号召：全力猛攻黄磷关！我们七个人报了名，在支部的直接领导和支持下，成立了攻关小组。
    我们七个人都是青年人，平均年龄只有十九岁半，有三个人读过初中，其余都是小学程度，谁也不懂得提炼黄磷的技术。这时候，党支部要我们用学理论、学技术和攻关三结合的方法来进行活动。我们的小组既是一个攻关小组，又是一个学习毛泽东同志著作的小组，也是一个科学技术研究小组。我们借了一部化学书，从上面查出了投料的成分和加热的要求，就根据这些要求来搭炉子做试验。但接连两次，都因为温度不够而失败了。我们仍坚持干下去。接着，支部又领导我们学习了毛主席对待困难的态度。毛主席用愚公移山的故事告诉我们，在战略上要藐视一切敌人，在战术上要重视一切敌人，“世上无难事，只怕有心人”。我们想，毛主席领导中国革命几十年，大革命失败了，他到了井冈山，白色恐怖那样凶，困难那样大，毛主席不害怕，坚持斗争，终于取得了胜利，我们现在的困难难道比毛主席那时候遇到的还大？党支部又进一步给我们指出：要能在战略上藐视困难，就要在战术上重视困难，认真地去对付它，不然，就会变成说空话。
    这时，厂里到南京去参观学习的同志们回来了。但是，他们参观的那个工厂的“小黄磷”车间，单厂房就有三层楼高，用的是电炉，要很大的变压器，没法照搬。大家正在苦恼，党支部指出科学原理只有一个，洋办法不能硬搬，我们就用洋设备的原理，走土办法的道路！支部又领导我们学习了王国藩穷棒子办社的故事，沙市丘玉龙三个皮匠一年办起了轮胎厂的故事。人家能白手起家，我们为什么就不能用穷办法办大事情呢？煤炉子温度不够，为什么不能搞土电炉！心窍一打开，办法就出来了。洋电炉的炉膛要用钢板，我们没有钢板，但陶瓷的坛坛罐罐可不少，就用一个大水缸来代替钢板，又用耐火砖代替了钢板下面的炭素板，七手八脚，花了一天多工夫，终于把土电炉搭成了。
    电炉通电了，我们怀着焦急的心情，轮番在炉旁值班。四小时后，出第一次渣，参观回来的同志一看，说：“和南京的一样！”大家满心欢喜。接着，炉顶上磷气管里冒烟了，空中满是黄磷的气味，大家高兴极了。正在鼓掌，忽然“嘭”的一声，炉膛爆炸了，炉顶冲开了，工棚里到处是烟。
    炉膛爆炸了，但是我们的出磷计划可并没有“爆炸”。大家就地坐下研究，认为磷蒸汽已经出来，磷火已经点燃了，这就是说，我们已经接近胜利了。失败是成功之母，爆炸了反而可以就此发现问题，找出改进的办法。现在的问题是：怕不怕，能不能坚持下去？大家说：怕就不来，来就不怕？于是我们就研究原因，修补炉子，继续试验一连七次，终于一步步找出了引起爆炸的原因。
    经过多次试验，固体磷还没有提炼出来，但是一到夜里，炉子周围的地面和水洼里到处闪烁着磷光。原来我们用来冷却和洗涤磷蒸汽的水没有采用循环装置，黄磷都随着水放跑了。采用循环水装置后，这个问题解决了，但是黄磷和水仍旧混在一起分不开。到南京参观回来的同志说，还应当有一道加热和搅拌的工序。我们立即照办。“五四”青年节那天，领导上要我们休息，我们谁也不愿走。厂里组织青年人去游玩，我们谁也不想去。我们想：四十一年前的这一天，上一辈的青年人在北京高举着反帝反封建的大旗，向敌人进行了英勇的斗争，今天我们要用忘我的劳动来纪念它，我们要拿自己双手提炼出来的固体磷来向党献礼。我们干到中午十一点，磷水还是浑黄一片，分不清哪是水、哪是黄磷。吃过饭，张永厚第一个跑了回来，他戴上橡皮手套朝缸底一摸，觉得有一块凸起来的东西，捞上来一看，可不就是一块固体磷么？他再下力一抄，黄黄的一大块又捞上来了。“出磷了！出磷了！”听到他的喊声，大家都跑来了，那一股高兴的劲头，真是谁也描写不出来！
