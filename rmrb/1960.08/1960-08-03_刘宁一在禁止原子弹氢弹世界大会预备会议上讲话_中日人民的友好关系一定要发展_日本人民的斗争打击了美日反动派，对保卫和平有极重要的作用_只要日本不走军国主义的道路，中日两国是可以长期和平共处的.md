Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd. Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation participating in the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament, delivered an important speech at the preparatory meeting of the conference today. The full text is as follows: Mr. Chairman, Friends:

The Chinese delegation is entrusted by various Chinese people's organizations to participate in the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. We represent the people of all circles in China to express our warm congratulations to the conference and pay our highest respects to the Japanese people who have always fought heroically against the use of nuclear weapons, against new imperialist war schemes, and against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The Chinese people have always deeply cared about our Japanese brothers and sisters who suffered from atomic bomb disasters in Hiroshima and Nagasaki fifteen years ago and from the U.S. hydrogen bomb test disaster on the high seas of the Pacific Ocean six years ago. We would like to extend our sincere condolences to them and their families.

The World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, initiated by the Japanese people, has been held five times. Each conference has made significant contributions to promoting the struggle of the world's people to ban nuclear weapons, oppose wars of aggression, and defend world peace. Japan is the only country that has suffered from nuclear weapons disasters. Therefore, the Japanese people have always stood at the forefront of the struggle against the use of nuclear weapon. The Japanese people's struggle against the use of nuclear weapons is part of the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. For fifteen years, the Japanese people have been waging a heroic and unyielding struggle for national independence and to avoid being dragged into the great danger of a nuclear war. Especially in recent years, the heroic Japanese people have launched waves of struggles against the U.S.-Japan military alliance and against U.S. military bases. So far, the Japanese people have launched twenty-two nationwide unified actions. The number of people participating in the struggle is increasing, and the strata participating in the struggle are becoming more and more extensive, and a national anti-American patriotic united front has been formed. Now the Japanese people have found a good way to unite all forces that can be united, launch a national mass movement, and fight for the withdrawal of American aggressors from Japan. Under the heavy blows of the Japanese people, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet was finally forced to step down, and Eisenhower finally canceled his visit to Japan, causing his Far East trip, which was planned to create new war threats, to suffer a painful defeat. The Japanese people's struggle has heavily struck the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, disrupted the U.S. imperialist aggression plan in the Far East, greatly encouraged the world's people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism, and has played an extremely important role in safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

The Japanese people's struggle is part of the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism. It has been supported by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and by all peace-loving people in the world. We are pleased to see that, in response to the Japanese people's struggle, the national democratic movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism are unprecedentedly surging forward; the movements of the people of Western countries against the revival of West German militarism, against the use of nuclear weapons, and against U.S. military bases are developing rapidly; and the struggle of the American people against their government's aggressive and war policies is also expanding. All these struggles of the broad masses of the people are influencing each other, supporting each other, and encouraging each other, forming a powerful torrent against imperialism, making imperialism overwhelmed and struggling to cope.

The Japanese people's struggle is a great encouragement and support to the Chinese people. It is U.S. imperialism, which is militarily occupying Japan, that still occupies China's territory of Taiwan. Therefore, the Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and resolutely supported the Japanese people's struggle. Mr. Asanuma said well during his visit to our country in March 1959: "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people." The common task closely links the people of our two countries together. China and Japan have a long history and cultural relationship, and there is a deep friendship between the people of the two countries. The nearly two thousand years of peaceful and friendly relations between China and Japan, although once damaged by Japanese militarism, that is a matter of the past. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, despite the fact that normal relations have not yet been restored between China and Japan, the people of the two countries have, through joint efforts, continuously increased and developed cultural and economic exchanges and friendly relations with each other. In the past two or three years, due to the obstruction and sabotage of U.S. imperialism and its agents, the friendly exchanges between the people of our two countries have been affected to a certain extent. However, this not only cannot weaken but instead strengthens the desire of the people of China and Japan for friendship with each other. We believe that the friendly relations between the people of China and Japan are bound to develop in the future, and no force can stop or destroy them.

The Chinese people have always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. As early as 1954, the Chinese government, together with the Indian government and the Burmese government, jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and established peaceful coexistence relations with many Asian, African, and some European countries based on these principles. Not long ago, our government also concluded a treaty of friendship and non-aggression with the Union of Burma and a treaty of peace and friendship with the Kingdom of Nepal based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We are also willing to implement peaceful coexistence with Western countries, including the United States, according to the same principles. We are even more willing to promote the normalization of relations between the two countries with our neighbor Japan based on the Five Principles. The Chinese people have always supported the Japanese people's desire to take the path of independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that as long as Japan does not take the path of militarism, China and Japan can coexist peacefully for a long time. The Chinese people and the government have always maintained that as long as the U.S.-Japan

    新华社2日讯　东京消息：参加第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的中国代表团团长刘宁一今天在大会预备会议上作了重要讲话。全文如下：主席先生，各位朋友们：
    中国代表团受中国各人民团体的委托，来参加第六届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会。我们代表中国各界人民，对大会表示热烈的祝贺，对一向为反对使用核武器、为反对帝国主义新的战争阴谋、为反对日美军事同盟条约而英勇斗争的日本人民，表示崇高的敬意。中国人民一向深切关怀十五年前在广岛和长崎遭受原子弹灾难、六年前在太平洋公海上遭受美国氢弹试验灾害的日本兄弟姊妹们，我们谨向他们和他们的家属致以亲切的慰问。
    由日本人民发起的禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会已经开过五次了，历届大会都对推动世界人民禁止核武器、反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平的斗争作出了重大的贡献。日本是唯一遭受过核武器灾害的国家，因此，日本人民一直站在反对使用核武器斗争的前列。日本人民反对使用核武器的斗争是日本人民为争取独立、民主、和平、中立而斗争的一部分。十五年来，日本人民为了民族独立，为了避免被卷入一场核战争的巨大危险，一直进行着英勇不屈的斗争。特别是近几年来，英勇的日本人民掀起了一浪高过一浪的反对日美军事同盟、反对美国军事基地的斗争。到目前为止，日本人民已经发动了二十二次全国规模的统一行动，参加斗争的人数越来越众多，参加斗争的阶层越来越广泛，并且已经形成了全民性的反美爱国统一战线。现在日本人民已经找到了团结一切可以团结的力量、发动全民性群众运动、为要求美国侵略者撤出日本而斗争的好办法。在日本人民的沉重打击下，岸信介内阁终于被迫下台，艾森豪威尔终于取消了对日本的访问，从而使他策划新的战争威胁的远东之行，遭到了惨痛的失败。日本人民的斗争沉重地打击了美日反动派，打乱了美帝国主义在远东的侵略计划，大大地鼓舞了世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，对保卫亚洲和世界的和平有着极为重要的作用。
    日本人民的斗争是全世界人民反对帝国主义斗争的一部分。它得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的支持。我们高兴地看到，同日本人民的斗争相呼应，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的民族民主运动，空前高涨；西方国家的人民反对复活西德军国主义、反对使用核武器、反对美国军事基地的运动，正在迅速发展；美国人民反对本国政府的侵略政策和战争政策的斗争也在日益扩大。所有这些广大的人民群众的斗争，都在彼此影响、互相支持、互相鼓舞，形成一股强大的反对帝国主义的洪流，使帝国主义顾此失彼，穷于应付。
    日本人民的斗争，对中国人民是一个极大的鼓舞和支持。至今侵占着中国领土台湾的，正是对日本进行军事占领的美帝国主义。因此，中国人民一向深切同情和坚决支持日本人民的斗争。1959年3月浅沼先生在我国访问时说得好：“美帝国主义是中日两国人民共同的敌人。”共同的任务把我们两国人民紧紧地联结在一起。中日两国有着悠久的历史和文化关系，两国人民之间有着深厚的友谊。中日两国将近二千年的和平友好关系，虽然曾经一度受到日本军国主义的损害，但是，事情已经过去。中华人民共和国成立以来，尽管中日两国之间还没有恢复正常关系，两国人民却通过共同的努力，使彼此之间的文化、经济交流和友好关系有了不断的增进和发展。最近两三年来，由于美帝国主义及其代理人的阻挠和破坏，我们两国人民之间的友好来往受到了一定的影响。但是，这不仅不能削弱，反而更加加强了中日两国人民要求彼此友好的愿望。我们相信，今后中日两国人民的友好关系是一定要发展的，是任何力量阻挡不住、破坏不了的。
    中国人民一贯主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处。早在1954年，中国政府就同印度政府、缅甸政府共同倡导了和平共处五项原则，并且根据这些原则，同许多亚非国家和一些欧洲国家，建立了和平共处的关系。不久以前，我国政府还根据和平共处五项原则，同缅甸联邦缔结了友好和互不侵犯条约，同尼泊尔王国缔结了和平友好条约。对西方国家，包括美国在内，我们也愿意根据同样的原则，同它们实行和平共处。我们对于自己的近邻日本，更是愿意根据五项原则，来促使两国关系正常化。中国人民一向支持日本人民走独立、和平、民主、中立道路的愿望。中国政府曾经一再表示，只要日本不走军国主义的道路，中日两国是可以长期和平共处的。中国人民和政府历来主张，只要废除日美军事同盟条约，停止复活日本军国主义，那末，中苏友好同盟互助条约有关防止日本军国主义再起的条款，就可以取消。中国人民和政府还一再主张，亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内，共同签订一项互不侵犯的和平公约，使这一地区成为无原子区。我国人民正在从事和平建设，我们的建设任务是长期的、艰巨的。我们迫切需要一个和平的国际环境，我们不需要战争，也不容许别人把战争强加在我们头上。我们愿意为保卫世界和平，为实现不同社会制度国家间的和平共处而奋斗。
    这次会议讨论着有关保卫世界和平的许多问题。中国代表团支持大会提出的有关禁止使用核武器、实现全面彻底裁军、取消一切外国军事基地和侵略性军事条约的议题。最近，在斯德哥尔摩举行的世界和平理事会常务委员会会议通过的总宣言，也就这些问题向全世界人民发出了号召。中国人民支持世界和平理事会常务委员会会议所作的号召。中国人民认为，要实现这些目标，就必须同帝国主义战争侵略势力进行坚决的斗争。目前的形势空前有利，只要全世界和平、民主、进步的力量，加强团结，结成最广泛的反对帝国主义的统一战线，以美国为首的帝国主义战争侵略势力就一定能够被击败，世界和平就能够得到维护。
    我们衷心地祝贺大会成功，祝日本人民不断获得新的胜利。
    各国人民的友好团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
