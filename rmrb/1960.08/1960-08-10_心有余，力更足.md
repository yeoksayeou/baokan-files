    "The Spirit is Willing, and the Flesh is Able"		Hebei, Zhu Yu
    "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." This is a phrase some people use to cover up when they want to do something but lack the courage. The meaning is: It is reasonable and justified not to do this work, "It is not that I don't want to do it, but that I can't." In their view, there is an insurmountable gap between "spirit" and "ability."
    In fact, the so-called "willing spirit" precisely indicates an upward drive, the courage to overcome difficulties, and confidence in victory. Therefore, those with a "willing spirit" must have "sufficient ability"; to say "ability is insufficient" means that the spirit is lacking.
    Where does "ability" come from? Potential is not revealed if it is not tapped, and strength is insufficient if it is not used. For heroes who put "action" first, they have a "mind" to dare to think and even more "ability" to dare to act. When they think that their work is a cause entrusted to them by the Party, they are full of energy, their strength is infinite, no difficulty can intimidate them, and no danger can stop them from moving forward.
    Now the Party has put forward the call that "agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and all sectors should support agriculture." We see that a mass movement of "agriculture raises the questions, and industry writes the answers," with all sectors wholeheartedly supporting agriculture, is unfolding vigorously across the country like a prairie fire. However, there are also some individuals who verbally shout that agriculture is important, but act slowly, do not take active measures, and repeatedly emphasize "it is truly a willing spirit, but the flesh is weak!" Supporting agriculture is the political task of the entire Party and all the people, and it is a guarantee for the realization of the General Line; no industry or department is special in this regard. Without the "heart" to support agriculture, how can there be the "ability" to support agriculture? We must continue to boost our energy, strongly establish the "heart" to support agriculture, and greatly promote the "ability" to support agriculture. The "willing spirit, but the flesh is weak" argument must stop!

### “心有余，力更足”

    “心有余，力更足”	河北　朱禹
    “心有余，力不足。”这是有的人当他想作某件事，又没勇气，而用以掩饰的一句话。意思就是说：这工作不干也合情合理，“非不为也，是不能也。”在他看来，“心”和“力”之间有一条不可逾越的鸿沟。
    其实，所谓“心有余”正是表明有力争向上的劲头，有战胜困难的勇气，对胜利充满了信心。所以，“心有余”的人，其“力”必足；要说“力不足”，那就是心里没“余”。
    “力”从哪来？潜力不挖不出，劲头不使不足。对于“干”字当头的英雄来说，他们有敢想之“心”，更有敢作之“力”。他们一想到自己的工作是党交给的事业，便浑身是劲，力量无穷，没有任何困难能把他们吓倒，没有任何艰险能阻止他们前进。
    现在党提出了“农业是国民经济的基础，各行各业都来支援农业”的号召。我们看到，一个“农业出题目，工业作文章”，各行各业人心向农的支援农业的群众运动，正在全国以燎原之势蓬勃展开。可是，也有个别人口头上空喊农业重要，行动起来却慢慢吞吞，不采取积极措施，一味强调“实在是心有余而力不足啊！”支援农业是全党全民的政治任务，是实现总路线的保证，这一点任何行业任何部门也不特殊。没有支援农业之“心”，哪能有支援农业之“力”？我们必须继续鼓足干劲，大树支援农业之“心”，大鼓支援农业之“力”。“心有余，力不足”论必须休止！
