Xinhua News Agency, 17th. In the current season of scorching heat in the south and heavy rain in the north, railway workers across the country are doing everything possible to vigorously grasp coal transportation to ensure the needs of increased steel and coal production.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the railway department has placed coal as the primary transportation material. Recently, based on the principle of ensuring key areas, it has adopted specific measures in three aspects to strengthen the car allocation work for coal transportation. First, from mid-July, the Ministry of Railways reduced the number of cars loaded with some secondary materials (such as bricks, tiles, sand, and gravel), and tried to improve the transportation efficiency of these materials as much as possible to tap potential. Since August, an average of nearly a thousand cars per day have been freed up from the transportation of these secondary materials for coal transportation. Second, the flow of vehicles was readjusted according to the distribution of key coal mines, and a "station troops in North China, protect the Northeast" arrangement was adopted in vehicle dispatch, thereby ensuring that major coal mines such as Kailuan, Yangquan, Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, Hegang, Jixi, Huainan, Pingxiang, and Zaozhuang have sufficient vehicles. Third, in addition to the daily car allocation plan, the number of mobile spare vehicles allocated to major coal mining areas every day in August increased from more than 1,400 in July to more than 1,900, ensuring that even if the empty cars dispatched to the mining areas according to the plan do not arrive due to temporary reasons, these spare vehicles can still be used to load coal.

In order to ensure that there are enough vehicles for coal transportation, the Ministry of Railways has also stipulated a practical and detailed inspection system: the Ministry of Railways inspects the daily car allocation plan and its implementation every half day; the directors of each railway bureau inspect every six hours; and the railway transportation dispatch departments at all levels inspect train by train.

Railway workers, together with coal mine workers, have also launched a mass movement to transport stockpiled coal since mid-July. The Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Coal jointly formulated a plan for transporting stockpiled coal and jointly held two telephone conferences to conduct inspections. These stockpiled coals were accumulated in the mining areas for a period of time without being transported out in time due to being far from the railway, scattered mines, or other reasons. In order to transport stockpiled coal, Hegang City mobilized more than 2,000 people and more than 200 coal loading machines, and laid 30 kilometers of light rail, so that more than 20 coal storage points could directly transport coal into coal bunkers for loading. The person in charge of the Industrial Department of the Hegang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the leading cadres of local railways and coal mines, participated in this work on the spot. According to incomplete statistics, coal mining areas across the country had transported 600,000 tons of stockpiled coal in the second half of July. The Jiulonggang and Wangfenggang stations of the Huainan Coal Mine have cleared the stockpiled coal at the loading points.

### 铁道部加强配车工作建立细致的检查制度  切实抓紧煤炭运输

    铁道部加强配车工作建立细致的检查制度
    切实抓紧煤炭运输
    新华社17日讯　在当前南方酷热、北方多雨的季节里，全国铁路职工千方百计地大抓煤炭运输，保证钢铁、煤炭增产的需要。
    大跃进以来，铁路部门就把煤炭列为首要的运输物资。最近，又根据保证重点的原则，从三个方面采取具体措施，加强了煤炭运输的配车工作。第一，铁道部从7月中旬起压缩了一部分次要物资（如砖瓦砂石）的装车数量，并尽量提高运这些物资的车辆的运输效率，挖掘潜力。8月份以来，已经从这些次要物资的运输车辆中，每天平均腾出了近千辆车用于煤炭运输。第二，按照重点煤矿的分布区域，重新调整了车辆流向，在车辆调度上采取“屯兵华北、保东北”的布置，从而保证了开滦、阳泉、抚顺、阜新、本溪、鹤岗、鸡西、淮南、萍乡、枣庄等主要煤矿有充足的车辆。第三，除了每天的配车计划外，8月份每天为各主要煤矿区配备的机动备用车辆，由7月份的一千四百多车增加为一千九百多车，保证按计划向矿区配送的空车因临时原因未到时，也能用这些备用车装煤。
    为了保证煤炭运输有足够的车辆，铁道部还规定了切实、细致的检查制度：对于每天的配车计划和执行情况，铁道部半天检查一次；各铁路局的局长六小时检查一次；各级铁路运输调度部门则逐列车地进行检查。
    铁路部门的职工还同煤矿职工一起，从7月中旬以来展开了一个拉运存煤的群众运动，铁道部和煤炭部共同制定了拉运存煤的方案，并联合召开了两次电话会议，进行了检查。这些存煤多是因为远离铁路以及矿井分散或其他原因，在过去一个时间积存在矿区没有及时运出来的。鹤岗市为了拉运存煤，调集了二千多人和二百多台装煤机具，并且铺设了三十公里长的轻便轨道，使二十多个贮煤点直接能把煤运进煤仓装车。中共鹤岗市委工业部的负责人，当地铁路、煤矿的领导干部，都到现场参加了这个工作。据不完全的统计，全国各煤矿区在7月下半月已经运出存煤六十万吨。淮南煤矿的九龙岗、望峰岗车站，已经扫清了装车点的存煤。
