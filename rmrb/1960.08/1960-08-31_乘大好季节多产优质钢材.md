Letter to the Editor

    After the People's Daily published the editorial "Immediately Launch a Production Increase and Thrift Campaign Centered on Grain and Steel," the workers of our Steel Rolling Team Eight immediately held a meeting to review the work of the past seven months and study the production increase and thrift plan for the next four months. As of August 20th, our team had already exceeded the shift production plan by 1.16%, the quality reached 99.69%, and the cost was reduced by more than 200 yuan compared to the national plan. The next four months are a critical period for completing the annual steel production plan and the golden season for steel production. We must summon greater enthusiasm, seize the favorable opportunity, advance victoriously, and produce more high-quality steel in terms of variety and specifications to meet the needs of the country and strongly support agriculture.
    In order to achieve the production increase plan, we have taken the following measures:
    1.  Conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds and guide our work.
    2.  Vigorously grasp the production plan. Continue to implement the "One-Two-Four-Eight System" of announcing every hour, reporting every two hours, checking every four hours, and evaluating every eight hours. Fully utilize the "Six Crossings" experience that proved effective in the first half of the year, achieving the first hour crossing the second hour, the first four hours crossing the next four hours, today crossing tomorrow, the first ten days of the month crossing the last ten days, the first week crossing the next week, and the first month crossing the next month.
    3.  Focusing on key production areas and weak links, continue to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. For example, in order to meet the needs of increased production, we are working on a belt coal conveyor to replace manual coal addition.
    4.  Carry out labor competitions within and outside the team to improve work time efficiency. Requirements include: quick steel retrieval, even heat, quick steel delivery, accurate delivery, quick steel feeding, no waste products, quick cutting, and accurate cutting.
    5.  Strengthen equipment management. In addition to the usual maintenance of equipment, we also adopt a method combining professional repair and mass self-inspection and self-repair, so that small repairs are done by ourselves, half of the major repairs are done by ourselves, and everyone strives to be a multi-skilled worker.
    We are vigorously implementing the above measures for increasing production and practicing thrift, and have achieved preliminary results. Since August 20th, we have exceeded the shift production plan by eight to eleven tons for three consecutive days, and the effective operating time has been shortened by one point ten minutes to one point twenty minutes compared to the original.

    乘大好季节多产优质钢材
    人民日报发表了“立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”的社论以后，我们轧钢八班职工立即召开会议，检查了今年七个多月的工作，研究了今后四个多月的增产节约计划。到8月20日止我们班已超额1.16％完成了轮班生产计划，质量达到99.69％，成本比国家计划降低二百多元。今后四个多月是完成全年钢材生产计划的关键时期，是钢铁生产的黄金季节，我们一定要鼓起更大的干劲，抓紧有利时机，乘胜前进，按品种、按规格增产更多的优质钢材，满足国家的需要，有力地支援农业。
    为了实现增产计划，我们采取了以下几项措施：
    一、认真学习毛主席的著作，用毛泽东思想来武装我们的思想和指导我们的工作。
    二、狠抓生产计划。继续贯彻一小时一公布、二小时一汇报、四小时一检查、八小时一评比的“一二四八制”，充分运用上半年行之有效的“六跨”经验，做到第一小时跨第二小时，前四小时跨后四小时，今天跨明天、上旬跨下旬、上周跨下周、上月跨下月。
    三、针对生产关键和薄弱环节，继续大搞技术革新和技术革命。如为了满足增产的需要，我们正在搞皮带运煤机，代替手工加煤。
    四、开展班内、班外劳动竞赛，提高作业时间效率。要求达到：捞钢快，热度匀，送钢快，送的准，喂钢快，无废品，切断快，切的准。
    五、加强设备管理，除平时维护好设备外，还采取专业检修和群众自检自修相结合的办法，做到小修自己干，大修干一半，人人争当多面手。
    上述增产节约措施，我们正在大力贯彻，并取得了初步效果。从8月20日起，一连三天都分别超额八到十一吨完成了轮班生产计划，有效作业时间比原来提前一点零十分钟到一点零二十分钟。
