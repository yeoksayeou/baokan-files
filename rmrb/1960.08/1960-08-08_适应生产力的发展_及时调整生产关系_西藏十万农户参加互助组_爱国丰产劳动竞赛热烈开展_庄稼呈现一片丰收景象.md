Lhasa, August 7th (this newspaper) – After the decisive victory of the democratic reform in the Tibetan countryside, agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement have also achieved great victories. The agricultural production mutual aid teams established throughout the region, like a sky full of stars, have brought an unprecedented and vibrant scene to the Tibetan plateau.
	The Broad Masses of Farmers are Organized

At present, more than 8,400 agricultural production mutual aid teams have been established in the vast rural areas of Tibet, with more than 100,000 farm households participating, accounting for 85% of the total number of farm households in the areas that have completed democratic reform. In areas such as Shannan, Nyingchi, Gyantse, and Lhasa, 90% to 95% of farm households have joined mutual aid teams. Since last winter, after completing land distribution, farmers in various regions have continued to muster revolutionary vigor, resolutely carried out the democratic reform thoroughly, and actively responded to the Party's call to organize mutual aid teams with socialist sprouts. The vast poor serfs and slaves who had nothing under the feudal serf system have experienced unprecedented enthusiasm for production and unprecedented improvement in political awareness after gaining liberation. At the same time, after being allocated land, they lacked labor, draught animals, and farm tools in production, and therefore urgently demanded to be organized and take the socialist road. The farmers generally said: We suffered together in the past, and now we must live a happy life together; the Party and Chairman Mao are the sun that warms us, and we must listen to the Party and Chairman Mao and follow the Party and Chairman Mao forever.
	Implement the Policy of Voluntary Participation and Mutual Benefit

When carrying out the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, Party committees at all levels constantly issued relevant instructions, organized work teams to vigorously publicize and actively implement the Party's policy of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, and ran many training classes for mutual aid team cadres and accounting training classes to help farmers cultivate a large number of cadres for mutual aid teams. A simple and easy-to-implement system of work point assessment and accounting was universally implemented within the mutual aid teams in various regions. The vast number of farmers who had just been liberated from the serf system were culturally backward, so methods such as issuing work point cards and work point tickets were used to divide labor and animal power into levels according to strength, assess work points daily, and settle accounts monthly or quarterly.
	Production is Carried Out Vigorously

After the establishment of mutual aid teams in various regions, they immediately absorbed the experience of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in the interior, implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, and launched a vigorous patriotic production increase labor emulation campaign. Red flags fluttered everywhere in the fields of various mutual aid teams, and the songs of mutual aid team members working collectively floated everywhere in the mountains and fields. The labor emulation campaigns between individuals and mutual aid teams swept away the stagnation and desolation of the Tibetan plateau for thousands of years.

Mutual aid teams in various regions have formulated this year's production increase targets and measures, and are focusing on water and fertilizer work. "Experimental fields" and "satellite fields" are also very common. During last year's winter plowing and this year's spring sowing and field management, mutual aid teams in various regions organized various field operation professional teams (groups). These professional teams not only solved the difficulties of lacking labor, draught animals, and farm tools, but also promoted the comprehensive development of agriculture, handicrafts, and sideline production, and farmers generally increased their income. According to statistics from the Shannan area: During last year's winter plowing and this year's spring plowing, a total of more than 4,300 irrigation canals were built throughout the area, with a total length of more than 4,000 li, and the irrigated area expanded from 60% in the past to more than 90%; more than 4 billion jin of fertilizer were accumulated, with an average application of 10,000 to 15,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu; 111 iron and wood production groups were established throughout the area, and more than 100,000 various farm tools were remodeled and created; more than 1,200 local fertilizer plants were established throughout the area, producing more than 170 million jin of local fertilizer; and the entire area vigorously reclaimed wasteland, expanding the planting area by more than 11,000 mu. Due to the great role played by mutual aid teams, this year's spring sowing in Tibet was advanced by 20 days to a month. Thanks to the efforts of mutual aid teams to cultivate meticulously, the entire region is now showing a scene of bumper harvest, and the autumn harvest will also be advanced by 20 days to a month compared with previous years.
	Collectivist Spirit is High

After agricultural production mutual aid teams began to organize in various regions of Tibet, they showed significant characteristics: most mutual aid teams have certain public means of production, such as oil mills, mills, carts, large farm tools, dairy cows, and some public land. Under the feudal serf system, all the land and almost all other means of production were occupied by serf owners and their agents, who accounted for less than 5% of the population, while the vast poor serfs and slaves had nothing. During the democratic reform, oil mills, mills, carts, large farm tools, dairy cows, etc., could not be distributed to households, and the farmers unanimously agreed that these things should be collectively owned by the mutual aid team; on the other hand, when distributing land, the small amount of mobile land left by the farmers' associations was also unanimously agreed by the farmers to be collectively owned by the mutual aid team when the mutual aid team was established. The farmers said: The mutual aid team belongs to all of us. In the past, we were all so poor that we didn't even have a leaf. Now, let's make these lands public to all of us! The income from these public means of production in the mutual aid team will also be used for the public accumulation of the mutual aid team. In various regions, there are also individual former poor serfs and slaves who, although land was distributed to them during the land reform, said: We used to suffer together and were used to working together. Now that we have turned over, it is inconvenient to cultivate separately, so it is better to combine together. Therefore, they merged their basically equal lands, without distinction between each other, organized mutual aid teams, managed them in a unified manner, and decided to implement distribution according to labor after the autumn harvest. The public means of production and public accumulation of mutual aid teams in various regions play an important role in expanding reproduction and developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement towards a higher stage.

After the broad masses of farmers participated in mutual aid teams, they gradually cultivated a new habit of collective labor and unity and fraternity, and received education in patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, and their political ideology and class consciousness were further improved. Some mutual aid teams in various regions have established reading groups, and some have established cultural night schools.
	Accelerating Towards Socialism

At present, the mutual aid teams in various regions of Tibet have generally undergone rectification and are becoming increasingly consolidated and improved. The broad masses of farmers have also begun to feel that the original mutual aid teams composed of more than a dozen households can no longer meet the needs of the development of productive forces. In order to continuously develop production and take the socialist road more quickly, farmers in various regions have spontaneously linked the original small mutual aid teams into larger groups. According to statistics from Zha'nang, Jia Cha, Longzi, Sangri, Lari, and other counties in the Shannan area, the original 623 mutual aid teams have been merged into 244 joint mutual aid teams.

    适应生产力的发展　及时调整生产关系
    西藏十万农户参加互助组
    爱国丰产劳动竞赛热烈开展　庄稼呈现一片丰收景象
    本报拉萨7日电　西藏农村民主改革取得决定性的胜利后，农业生产和互助合作运动也取得了伟大胜利。各地建立起来的农业生产互助组，像满天繁星，使西藏高原上出现了空前未有的生气勃勃的景象。	广大农户组织起来
    目前，西藏广大农村里已经建立了八千四百多个农业生产互助组，参加互助组的有十万多农户，占已经完成民主改革地区总农户的85％。在山南、林芝、江孜等专区和拉萨市，已有90％到95％的农户参加了互助组。去年冬季以来，各地农民在完成土地分配后，就一面继续鼓足革命干劲，坚决把民主改革搞彻底，一面纷纷响应党的号召，先后组织起了社会主义萌芽性质的互助组。过去在封建农奴制度下一无所有的广大贫苦农奴和奴隶，在获得翻身后，生产热情空前高涨，政治觉悟空前提高；同时，他们在分得土地后，生产上缺乏劳力、耕畜、农具，因此迫切要求组织起来，走社会主义道路。农民们普遍地说：过去我们在一起受苦，现在过幸福生活也要在一起；党和毛主席是温暖我们的太阳，我们一定要听党和毛主席的话，永远跟着党和毛主席走。	  贯彻自愿互利政策
    在开展农业生产互助合作运动时，各级党委不断发出有关指示，并组织工作组向农民大力宣传和积极贯彻执行了党的自愿互利政策，开办了许多互助组干部训练班和会计训练班，帮助农民培养了大批互助组的干部。各地互助组内普遍实行了简便易行的评工记分、凭工结账制度。刚从农奴制度下翻身的广大农民，文化落后，就以发给工分牌、工分票等办法，将劳力、畜力按强弱分成等级，逐日评工记分，按月或按季清工结账。	生产搞得热气腾腾
    各地互助组成立后，立即吸取内地农业生产大跃进的经验，贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，开展了轰轰烈烈的爱国丰产劳动竞赛，流动红旗在各互助组的田地里到处招展，互助组组员们集体劳动的歌声在山野间到处飘扬，个人与个人、互助组与互助组间挑战应战的劳动竞赛，把西藏高原千百年来的死气和凄凉，一扫而光。
    各地互助组制定了今年的增产指标和增产措施，狠抓水肥工作，“试验田”、“卫星田”也很普遍。各地互助组在去年冬耕和今年春播、田间管理期间，组织了各种田间作业专业队（组），这些专业队不仅解决了缺乏劳力、畜力和农具的困难，而且也促进了农业、手工业、副业生产的全面发展，农民们普遍增加了收入。据山南专区统计：去年冬耕和今年春耕期间，全区共修水渠四千三百多条，长达四千多华里，灌溉面积由过去的60％扩大到90％以上；积肥四十多亿斤，平均每克（亩）施底肥一万斤至一万五千斤；全区成立了一百一十一个铁木生产小组，共改制和创制各种农具十多万件；全区办了一千二百多个土化肥厂，制成土化肥一亿七千多万斤；全区大力开荒，扩大播种面积一万一千多克（亩）。由于互助组发挥了巨大作用，今年西藏全区的春播提前了二十天到一个月，由于互助组努力精耕细作，现在全区已呈现一片丰收的景象，秋收也将比往年提前二十天到一个月。	集体主义精神高涨
    西藏各地农业生产互助组开始组织起来后，就表现出了显著的特点：绝大部分互助组都有一定的公共生产资料，如油房、磨房、大车、大农具、奶牛和一部分公共土地等。在封建农奴制度下，全部土地和几乎全部的其他生产资料都被占人口不到5％的农奴主及其代理人所占有，而广大贫苦农奴和奴隶一无所有。民主改革时，油房、磨房、大车、大农具、奶牛等无法分配到户，农民一致赞同将这些东西作为互助组集体所有；另一方面，分配土地时农会留下的少量机动的土地，在成立互助组时，农民也一致赞同作为互助组集体所有。农民们说：互助组是我们大家的，过去我们都穷得连一个树叶子也没有，现在这些土地给我们大家公有吧！互助组里这些公共生产资料的收入，也就作了互助组的公共积累。各地还有个别原先的贫苦农奴和奴隶，虽然土改时土地分配到户，但是他们说：我们过去在一起受苦，也在一起劳动习惯了，现在翻了身，分开耕种不方便，还是合起来好。于是，他们就将各自分得的基本上相等的土地并在一起，不分彼此，组织起互助组，统一经营起来，并且决定秋收后实行按劳分配。各地互助组的公共生产资料和公共积累，对扩大再生产和互助合作运动向着高级阶段发展，有着重要的作用。
    广大农民参加互助组后，逐渐培养起了一种新的集体劳动和团结友爱的习惯，受到了爱国主义、集体主义和社会主义的教育，政治思想和阶级觉悟得到了进一步提高。各地互助组，有的成立了读报组，有的开办了文化夜校。	  加速走向社会主义
    目前，西藏各地的互助组已普遍经过整顿，日益巩固提高。广大农民又开始觉得原来十几户组成的互助组，已不能适应生产力发展的需要了。为了不断发展生产，更迅速地走社会主义道路，各地农民纷纷自动地将原来的小互助组联成了大组。据山南专区的札囊、加查、隆子、桑日、拉加里等县统计，已将原来六百二十三个互助组，合并成了二百四十四个互助联组。
