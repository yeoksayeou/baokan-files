A Record of Gathering Herbs
Fan Ziai

	In the autumn of 1935, the organization transferred me to the Red First Army Corps' Hygiene Department as an orderly. At that time, the Red First Army Corps had just arrived in northern Shaanxi after the Long March. Southern comrades suffered especially from colds, dysentery, relapsing fever, and other diseases, and the Hygiene Department was full of sick and wounded soldiers. The Party Central Committee called on the Red Army to recuperate and then cross the Yellow River eastward to resist Japan, which required us to quickly heal these sick and wounded soldiers. During the Long March, all the medicines had been used up. The northern Shaanxi area was remote, and Western medicines were not available. Without medicine, how could we treat the sick? At that time, the doctors tried every possible means, using salt water to wash wounds; mobilizing cadres to hand over cotton quilts and bed sheets, which were steamed and disinfected to be used as medicinal cotton and bandages; and twisting wool into wool balls to be used as medicine applicators...; but these could not solve the problem of medicine.

	In winter, we moved from our original garrison to Linzhen Town, where the troops prepared to rest for a period. This was a small town with forty or fifty households. Besides a few oil mills and general stores, there was also a small traditional Chinese medicine shop with a plaster sign hanging outside. On market days, the nearby villagers came here to sell things, which made it quite lively. After we entered the village, we moved into the house assigned by the management section. Everyone worked together to tidy up and clean, and no one noticed that Dr. Hu was missing. It wasn't until almost mealtime that we saw him come in excitedly from outside, carrying many paper packages. He shouted at the door, "Little devil, come and help!" It turned out that he had gone to that small Chinese medicine shop to purchase traditional Chinese medicine.

	That night, we set up a medicine pot and boiled medicine, starting to use traditional Chinese medicine to treat the sick and wounded soldiers. However, there were many people but little medicine. After a few days, the medicine from that small shop was almost bought out by us. The sick and wounded soldiers were about to run out of medicine again. This time, I didn't see Dr. Hu frown, but I saw him constantly going in and out, talking to the villagers, and visiting the landlord, Grandpa, and the pharmacy owner. Sometimes he ran outside the village, and would be gone for half a day, returning covered in mud and grass burrs, and also digging up some grass roots.

	One afternoon, the management section suddenly called a meeting of the Hygiene Department's orderlies and the security platoon comrades. This meeting was very novel. After the instructor talked about the shortage of medicine and the conditions of the sick and wounded soldiers, Dr. Hu stood up holding some grass roots and tree bark, and said bluntly: "This is licorice, this is white Chinese wolfberry... its root looks like this, its leaves look like this..." It turned out that we were being mobilized to go up the mountain to gather herbs. When we heard that we could gather herbs to treat the comrades, who wouldn't be happy! We started as soon as we heard, as if we had received the order to go out and fight the "White Bandit" again. Everyone rubbed their fists and prepared to go up the mountain.

	From then on, every day after meals, we went to gather herbs with Dr. Hu during our activity time. When we set off, everyone carried leg wrappings for bundling herbs. Some had sickles and axes hanging from their waists, and some carried small shovels and hoes. Two or three li outside the village were uninhabited barren mountains and forests. The mountains were also earthen mountains, and the weeds grew as tall as a person, and you couldn't even find a small stone. In the dark, dense forest, you couldn't even see the sun when you entered. Although this place was sparsely populated, it was truly a treasure trove. There were all kinds of medicinal herbs, and you couldn't finish gathering them all. Although there were many medicinal herbs, they were not so easy to obtain: some grew with weeds and were not easy to recognize. If you were a little careless, you might carry a bundle of weeds back; some were buried deep in the soil and had to be dug out little by little with a small hoe; some grew on trees, which required climbing skills; and some grew on cliffs, out of reach. I remember once, in order to pick a white Chinese wolfberry growing on a hillside, I used a leg wrapping to tie around my waist, and had a comrade two years older than me lower me down. When the medicine was in hand, he ran out of strength pulling me up, and he was so anxious that he shouted for help. Fortunately, someone was gathering herbs nearby, and everyone ran over and helped pull me up.

	There were many wild animals in the mountains and forests. Sometimes, when we were looking down to gather herbs, a deer or wild goat would suddenly jump out in front of us, and we would chase it for a while. If we encountered wild boars and wolf packs, it would be troublesome. At that time, bullets were scarce, and firing indiscriminately was against the rules. Everyone had to shout and drive them away. In order to prevent harm from wild animals, Dr. Hu divided us into several groups and found older comrades to lead the teams. Wild animals were not without use to us. We once picked up a deer antler that looked like a dead branch, which made Dr. Hu very happy, because it was such a precious medicinal material at the time.

	The scenery after a snowfall on the mountain was especially beautiful: the snow and the sun reflected each other, dazzling people's eyes. The branches of the big trees were covered with snow, like coiled white dragons. The melted snow turned into ice pillars, in various shapes. The snow sealed the road and covered the medicinal herbs, but we still went up the mountain as usual. An old man in the town who had been herding sheep for more than forty years heard that we were gathering medicinal herbs on the mountain, and volunteered to lead the way. None of us had cotton shoes. Most of the southern comrades wore a pair of straw sandals, with a layer of sheepskin wrapped outside. One foot was a foot and a half long, and every step left a large snow pit. People who didn't know would really think it was the footprint of some monster!

	Sometimes, we walked far away to gather herbs, and it was dark before we returned. Everyone would light a piece of sulfur that they had picked up with branches, and walk out of the deep mountains and forests in twos and threes. Sometimes they would also hold torches, walking and jumping, just like playing with lanterns during the Spring Festival. Later, we would let go of our voices and sing mountain songs, the more we sang, the more energetic we became, driving away the cold and fatigue.

	When we brought the herbs back, the comrades had classes during the day, so boiling the medicine was the responsibility of me and Dr. Hu. I stoked the fire, and Dr. Hu filled the pot with medicine, added water, and watched the heat. The villagers called the place where we lived a medicine factory. In fact, all the equipment of this medicine factory was three large iron pots propped up against the south wall of the courtyard. These pots were borrowed from the villagers, and the firewood was also cut by ourselves from the mountains.

	Stoking the fire was originally a simple matter, but because I was only fifteen years old at the time, I was young and ignorant, and I had burned it badly before. Once Dr. Hu went to a meeting, and I stoked the fire alone for a while. When it was time for dinner, I went to eat. Who knew that when I came back from dinner, the medicine in the pot already had a burnt smell.

	"What should I do? What would happen if Dr. Hu knew?" I hurriedly added a few ladles of water, stirred the medicine in the pot, covered the pot, and boiled it again. While stoking the fire, I muttered to myself: "The medicine boiled like this might still be usable. If I tell Dr. Hu, then he..."

	Dr. Hu came back, walked around the medicine pot, and was about to go into the house, but turned back again, worriedly asking me:

	"Why hasn't this pot of medicine been boiled well after so long?"

	"..."

	He walked over, lifted the lid of the pot, used chopsticks to stir the medicinal herbs, leaned down and smelled them, and then picked up some medicinal herbs and looked at them closely.

	"What? It's burnt, what happened? Were you away from here just now?"

	"No..." Because I was afraid of being criticized and punished, I actually lied foolishly at the time.

	"That's not right, little devil, if you were here, you wouldn't have missed that it was burning!" At this time, I felt that I could no longer hide it, so I told the truth. He told me to quickly remove the firewood. He was really anxious, his thick eyebrows furrowed together, and his face was flushed. However, after walking back and forth in the courtyard a few times, he calmed down again.

	"Little Fan, you know, you are boiling medicine for your class brothers—the Red Army soldiers!" He helped me pour out the medicine in the pot, and after brushing the pot clean, he continued to say to me while rummaging through the burnt medicinal herbs: "You know, how many medicinal pills will be made less by burning this pot of medicine? How many illnesses can these medicinal pills cure? These were brought back by many comrades with great effort, it's not easy!"

	I cried in shame. I am a member of the Communist Youth League, how could I be so careless in treating my work? Because I didn't fulfill my responsibility, a large pot was ruined at once. This is truly an unforgivable mistake!

	That night, the cave where we lived was both tense and busy. Dr. Hu took off his linen coat and sat alone at the square table filled with basins and pots, under a kerosene lamp, preparing the medicine. Sometimes I would help him do something, such as crushing the medicine in the mortar. Having learned the lesson from last time, I dared not be negligent when doing this work, and I dared not leave until the lights-out bugle was blown and Dr. Hu told me to go to sleep. Dr. Hu was still working late into the night.

	After he prepared the medicine, we would roll the medicinal pills the next day. We didn't have the pill-rolling tools from the pharmacy, so we used our fingers, which was really not as enjoyable for us bouncing children as gathering herbs in the mountains.

	We lived in Linzhen Town for more than a month, and we collected and made a lot of medicine. I can name forty or fifty kinds. I remember once, I secretly opened the pharmacist's medicine store and looked. Two-thirds of the basins and pots were filled with medicinal pills that we collected, boiled, and rolled ourselves. These medicines were the most effective for treating colds, dysentery, and other diseases at the time. Before long, a large number of sick and wounded soldiers were cured and discharged from the hospital and returned to their units.

    采药记
    范自爱
    1935年的秋天，组织上调我到红一军团卫生部当勤务员。那时红一军团刚经过长征到陕北，南方同志患感冒、痢疾、回归热等病的特别多，卫生部收满了伤病员。当时党中央号召红军休整后，东渡黄河抗日，需要我们很快治好这些伤病员。在长征路上，把所有的药物都消耗尽了。陕北地区偏僻，西药是买不到的。没有药怎么能治病呢？那时大夫们想尽了办法，用食盐水洗伤口；动员干部交出棉被、床单，蒸煮消毒后当药棉和绷带用；把羊毛绒搓成毛球当上药的捻子……；但这些都解决不了药的问题。
    冬天，我们从原来的驻地搬到了临真镇，部队准备在这里休整一个时期。这是一个四、五十户人家的小镇，街上除了有几家油房和杂货铺外，还有一家挂着膏药幌子的小中药铺。每逢集日，附近的老乡都到这里卖东西，倒也很热闹。我们进村后，便搬到管理科分配的房子。大家一齐动手忙着收拾打扫，谁也没注意胡医生不见了。一直到快吃饭的时候，才见他兴冲冲地从外面进来，抱着不少纸包包，进门就喊我：“小鬼，快来帮忙。”原来他是去那个小中药铺采购中药去了。
    当晚我们便支起药锅熬药，开始用中药给伤病员治病。但是人多药少，没有几天，那家小药铺的药，就差不多被我们买光了。伤病员又快没药吃了。这回我却没见胡医生皱眉毛，倒见他出出进进不断找老乡谈话，访问房东老爷爷和药铺掌柜。有时还跑到村外去，一去就是半天，回来时弄得满身泥土草刺，还刨到一些草根子。
    一天下午，管理科忽然召集卫生部的勤杂人员和警卫排的同志们开会。这个会开的很新鲜，指导员讲了讲缺药的情况和伤病员的病况以后，胡医生抱着一些草根树皮站起来，开门见山地说：这是甘草，这是白枸?子……它的根什么样，叶什么样……原来是动员大家上山采药。我们听说能够采药给同志们治病，谁不高兴！说干就干，就像又接到出发打“白狗子”的命令似地，大家磨拳擦掌，准备上山。
    从此每天饭后的活动时间，我们就跟胡医生去采药。出发时每人都带着捆药的绑腿，有人腰里别着镰刀斧头，有的拿着小锹小镐。出村二、三里地就是人迹罕到的荒山丛林。山也是土山，野草长的一人高，连块小石头也找不着。黑压压的大森林，进到里面连太阳也看不见。这地方虽然人烟稀少，倒真是块宝地。各种各样的药材，采也采不完。药材虽然多，但也不是那么容易到手的：它们有的和野草长在一起，不容易认清，稍马虎一些，说不定背一捆野草回去；有的深深埋在土里，要用小镐头一点一点地刨；有的是长在树上，这就要靠爬树的本领了；还有的是长在崖畔上，上下够不着。记得有一次我为了采一株长在半坡上的白枸?子，用绑腿系住腰，让一个比我大两岁的同志把我吊下去，药采到手，他向上拉我的时候，力气却使尽了，急得他连喊带叫地求救。幸亏附近有人采药，大家跑来，帮着把我拉了上去。
    山林里野兽很多，有时我们正低头采药，猛然会从眼前窜出一只鹿或野羊，我们就追一阵。如果碰上野猪和狼群，可就麻烦了，那时子弹又缺，乱开枪是违犯纪律的，大家只好呼喝一阵，把它们赶跑。为了预防野兽的伤害，胡医生把我们编成几个组，找年长的同志带队。野兽对我们也不是没有用处，我们曾经捡到一支像枯树枝似的鹿角，可把胡医生欢喜坏了，因为这在当时是多么珍贵的药材啊。
    雪后上山别有一番景色：雪和太阳相辉映，照得人眼睛发花，大树枝上盖满了积雪，像一条条盘卷着的白龙，化下来的雪水，又冻成了一根根的冰柱，千姿万态。雪把路封了，也把药材给盖了起来，但我们还是照样上山。镇上一位放了四十多年羊的老大爷听说我们在山上采药材，便自告奋勇来带路。我们都没有棉鞋。南方的同志大都穿一双草鞋，外面包上一层羊皮，一只脚就有尺半长，走一步留下一个大雪窝，不知道的人，真会以为是什么怪兽的足迹呢！
    有时，我们采药走远了，天大黑才回去，大家便用树枝夹一块捡到的硫磺点着，三三两两从深山老林里走出来，有时也手举火把，走着跳着，就跟春节玩灯似的，到后来，我们就放开嗓子唱起山歌来，越唱越有劲，把寒冷和疲倦都给赶跑了。
    采回药来，同志们白天都有操课，熬药就由我和胡医生担任。我烧火，胡医生装药，添水，看火候。老乡们把我们住的地方叫药厂，其实这药厂的全部设备，就是院中靠南墙支着的三口大铁锅，这锅还是从老乡家借来的，木柴也是我们自己从山上打来的。
    烧火，本来是件简单的事情，可是由于那时我只有十五岁，年轻不懂事，也曾烧坏过。有一次胡医生开会去了，我独自烧了一会火，到开饭时间就吃饭去了，谁知道吃饭回来，锅里的药已经有糊味了。
    “这怎么办呢？胡医生知道了那还得了。”我急忙添了几瓢水，把锅里的药搅了搅，盖上锅又煮了起来。一面烧火一面心里嘀咕：“这样熬出来的药，也许还能用，告诉胡医生，那他……”
    胡医生回来，在药锅旁转了一圈，快要进屋去了，却又转回身来，不放心地问我：
    “怎么，这半天了，这锅药还没熬好？”
        “……”
    他走了过来，揭开锅盖，用筷子把药材一拨，伏下身闻了闻，又挑起些药材，凑到眼前细看。
    “怎么？糊了，怎么回事？”刚才你离开过这里吗！”
    “没有……”因为怕挨批评受处分，我当时竟然愚蠢地撒起谎来。
    “不对，小鬼，你要是在这里，还能看不见烧糊了！”这时，我觉得不能再隐瞒了，便说了实话。他让我赶紧把柴火退了。他真急了，两道浓眉紧蹙在一起，脸也涨得通红。可是，他在院里来回走了几圈之后，又平静了下来。
    “小范，你知道，你这是在给自己的阶级弟兄——红军战士们熬药呀！”他帮我把锅里的药材倒出来，把锅刷干净后，一面翻弄烧糊了的药材，一面继续对我说：“你知道，烧坏了这锅药，该少作多少药丸子？这些药丸子又能治好多少病。这是很多同志费了好大的劲才采回来的，来之不易呀！”
    我羞愧得哭了起来。自己是个共青团员，怎么那样粗心大意对待工作呢？由于自己没尽到责任，一下子就坏了一大锅。这真是不能宽恕的错误啊！
    晚上，我们住的那间窑洞又紧张又忙碌。胡医生脱掉了那件麻布大衣，一个人坐在堆满盆盆罐罐的方桌旁，在一盏马灯底下，配起药来。我有时也帮他作点什么，比如在药槽里把药碾碎。接受了上次的教训，做这件工作时，我再不敢疏忽大意了，直到吹了熄灯号，胡医生叫我去睡的时候，才敢离开。胡医生仍是熬着夜在工作。
    他把药配好后，第二天就由我们来搓药丸。我们没有药铺里的搓药工具，就用手指头，这对我们那伙跳跳蹦蹦的娃娃来说，真不如到山里采药痛快。
    在临真镇住了一个多月，我们采制了很多药，光我能叫上名字的，就有四、五十种。记得有一次，我偷偷打开司药的药库看了看，盆盆罐罐里装的有三分之二是自己采、自己熬、自己搓的药丸。这些药当时治感冒、痢疾等病是最有效的。没有多久，大批伤病员便治愈出院归队了。
