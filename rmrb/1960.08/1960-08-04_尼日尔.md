Niger is a landlocked country in West Africa, with an area of over 1.276 million square kilometers, more than twice the size of mainland France, and a population of 2.5 million. Around the 10th century, a large kingdom called Bornu appeared in the area. However, from 1900 onwards, French colonists began to invade, and eight years later, Niger became their colony.

Due to France's long-term colonial rule, Niger is still an agricultural and pastoral country. The main agricultural products are peanuts and cotton. In foreign trade, peanuts account for 80% of the export value, and livestock accounts for 20%. There is almost no industry in the country. The colonialist plunder and exploitation have made the lives of the Niger people extremely difficult, and the population mortality rate is one of the highest in the world.

The people of Niger have a tradition of fighting against colonial rule. From 1916 to 1919, they carried out an armed struggle against France. Since World War II, especially since de Gaulle came to power, the national independence movement has been surging. Under these circumstances, in order to continue maintaining its colonial rule, the French colonists, in 1957, granted Niger the status of a "semi-autonomous republic" according to the so-called "Basic Law" for overseas territories, and in 1958, they declared Niger an "autonomous republic" within the "French Community." However, the people of Niger firmly demanded independence. In the so-called "referendum" directed by France in September 1958, 62% of the Niger people abstained, and in the 1957 territorial election, abstentions accounted for 73%, while in the parliamentary election at the end of 1958, abstentions were as high as 80%. This resolute action by the people of Niger to resist the French colonialist conspiracy fully demonstrated their determination to get rid of French colonial rule and strive for independence. In July of this year, France was finally forced to agree to Niger's independence within the "French Community."

    尼日尔
    尼日尔是西非的一个内陆国家，面积超过法国本土一倍以上，达一百二十七万六千多平方公里，人口二百五十万。约在十世纪时，当地曾经出现过名为博尔努的大王国。但从1900年起，法国殖民者就开始入侵，并在八年后，把尼日尔变为它的殖民地。
    由于法国长期的殖民统治，尼日尔目前仍是一个农牧业国家。农产品主要是花生和棉花。在对外贸易中，花生占出口值的80％，牲畜占20％。国内几乎没有工业。殖民主义的掠夺与压榨，使尼日尔人民生活极端困苦，人口死亡率在全世界是最高的地区之一。
    尼日尔人民具有反抗殖民统治的斗争传统。在1916年至1919年，曾进行过反法武装斗争。第二次世界大战以来，特别是戴高乐上台以来，民族独立运动日益高涨。在这种情况下，法国殖民者为了继续保持其殖民统治，在1957年根据所谓海外领地“根本法”，给予尼日尔以“半自治共和国”的地位，在1958年又宣布尼日尔为“法兰西共同体”内的“自治共和国”。但是，尼日尔人民坚决要求获得独立。在1958年9月法国导演的所谓“公民投票”中，尼日尔人民有62％弃权，在1957年领地选举中，弃权的占73％，而1958年底的议会选举中弃权的更高达80％。尼日尔人民的这种抵制法国殖民主义阴谋的坚决行动充分表明了他们要求摆脱法国殖民统治和争取独立的决心。今年7月，法国终于被迫同意尼日尔在“法兰西共同体”内独立。　（徐）
