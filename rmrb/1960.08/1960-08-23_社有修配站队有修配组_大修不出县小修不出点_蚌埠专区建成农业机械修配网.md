Commune-run Repair Stations Have Repair Teams; Major Repairs Stay Within the County, Minor Repairs Stay Within the Point
Bengbu Region Builds Agricultural Machinery Repair Network

    (Reported by our newspaper) With the strong support of the industrial sector, the people's communes in the Bengbu region of Anhui province have promoted the spirit of self-reliance and vigorously built agricultural machinery repair stations. Currently, among the 217 communes and 1,985 production brigades in the region, 2,485 large and small agricultural machinery repair stations and teams have been built, employing more than 9,200 various maintenance technicians. Every commune now has a repair station, and every team has a repair group. After the establishment of the agricultural machinery repair network, many places have achieved major repairs within the county, medium repairs within the commune, and minor repairs within the repair point, with repairs done as soon as breakdowns occur, greatly improving the utilization rate of agricultural machinery.

    Since the people's communes were established, the agricultural machinery equipment in the Bengbu region has increased exponentially. The region now has 690 standard units of various types of tractors and 3,301 units of various irrigation and drainage machinery, totaling more than 100,027 horsepower. However, before the establishment of the agricultural machinery repair network, the utilization rate of these mechanical power sources was often low due to untimely maintenance and a lack of spare parts, with about one-third to one-half of the machinery frequently out of service. According to statistics from five counties, including Tianchang, Fengyang, Suixi, Sixian, and Dangshan, during the spring plowing season this year, 40 standard units out of 131 standard units of tractors were out of service due to poor maintenance; and 45% of the more than 20,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery were frequently damaged and out of service.

    In order to fully utilize agricultural machinery power equipment, the Bengbu Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has vigorously strengthened its leadership in agricultural machinery maintenance this year, instructing all people's communes to establish agricultural machinery repair organizations. The industrial departments of the region have manufactured a large number of lathes, milling machines, planers, drilling machines, and vises, and other repair machinery and tools to support the communes in establishing agricultural machinery repair stations. Many factories above the county level have also sent their best technicians to the communes to help train repair personnel. For example, the four county-run machinery factories in Suxian County sent 67 technicians to the communes. In the process of establishing agricultural machinery repair organizations, the communes and brigades also promoted the spirit of self-reliance, adopted indigenous methods, overcame the three major difficulties of equipment, technology, and raw materials, and built a set of machinery repair equipment and tools. In order to improve the utilization rate of agricultural machinery power equipment, the Bengbu region also universally conducted technical training in machine operation and maintenance for machine operators.

    With a sound mechanical repair organization and skilled operators, the utilization rate of agricultural machinery has significantly improved. For example, the tractor utilization rate in Suxian County was generally only about 60%, but it has now increased to more than 95%. In the past, the average cultivated area of one standard unit of tractor in the county was 6,000 mu per year, but in the first half of this year, the cultivated area has reached about 5,000 mu; the cost per mu of mechanized farming has also been reduced from 1.2 yuan to about 0.8 yuan. According to statistics, the full utilization of irrigation and drainage machinery alone has saved about 170,000 laborers in the region, which have been put into the current autumn field management.

    社有修配站队有修配组　大修不出县小修不出点
    蚌埠专区建成农业机械修配网
    本报讯　安徽省蚌埠专区各人民公社在工业部门有力支援下，发扬自力更生的精神，大建农业机械修配站。目前，在全专区二百一十七个公社，一千九百八十五个生产大队中，已建成大、小农业机械修配站、组二千四百八十五个，拥有各种维修技术人员九千二百多人。社社都有了修配站，队队有修配组。建立了农业机械修配网以后，许多地方做到了大修不出县，中修不出社，小修不出修配点，随坏随修理，大大提高了农业机械的利用率。
    蚌埠专区的农业机械设备，在人民公社化以后，有了成倍地增长。全专区现有各种型号的拖拉机六百九十个标准台，各种排灌机械三千三百零一台，计十万零二千七百多马力。但是在没有建成农业机械修配网以前，这些机械动力，经常因维修不及时，配件缺乏，利用率不高，有三分之一到一半左右的机械，经常不能使用。据天长，凤阳、濉溪、泗县、砀山五个县的统计，今年春耕期间，在一百三十一个标准台拖拉机中，因维修不好，损坏不能使用的就有四十个标准台；在二万多马力的排灌机械中，经常损坏而停止使用的就占45％。
    为了把农业机械动力设备充分使用起来，中共蚌埠地委今年大力加强了对农业机械维修工作的领导，指示各人民公社都要建立农业机械修配组织。专区各工业部门，制造了大批车床、铣床、刨床、钻床和虎钳等修配机械和工具，支援公社建立农业机械修配站。很多县以上工厂，还把最好的技工下放到公社帮助培训修配人员。宿县的四个县营机械厂就下放了技工六十七人到公社。各公社、大队在建立农业机械修配组织中，还发扬了自力更生的精神，采取了土法上马的办法，克服了设备、技术、原料三大难关，建成了一套机械修理的设备和工具。为了提高农业机械动力设备的利用率，蚌埠专区还普遍对机器操作人员进行了机械操作和维护的技术训练。
    有了健全的机械修理机构，又有了熟练的操作人员，农业机械的利用率显著提高。如宿县的拖拉机出车率一般只在60％左右，目前已提高到95％以上。过去全县平均一个标准台拖拉机一年机耕地面积达六千亩，而今年上半年，机耕地面积已达五千亩左右；每亩机耕一次的费用也由过去的一元二角降低到八角左右。据统计，全区目前仅就排灌机械得到充分利用一项，就节省了约十七万个劳力，投入了当前秋田管理。
