Xinhua News Agency, August 8th. Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, delivered a written speech today entitled "Cultural and Art Workers Must Fight to Thoroughly Realize the Party's Cultural Revolution Program" at the Third National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers. He called on cultural and art workers to resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, always be promoters of the cultural revolution, strive for a complete victory in the "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology" struggle in the ideological field, better serve the development of production, and fight for the intellectualization of workers and peasants and the laborization of intellectuals.

In his speech, Qian Junrui first expressed his heartfelt support for the congratulatory message delivered by Comrade Lu Dingyi on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to the congress, and for Comrade Zhou Yang's report. After reviewing the brilliant achievements made by cultural and artistic work under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao since the Second National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers in September 1953, Qian Junrui expressed his views on the issue of cultural and artistic workers must always be promoters of the cultural revolution. Qian Junrui said that our people are now launching a great upsurge in studying Marxism-Leninism, studying Mao Zedong's works, and studying dialectical materialism. This is a great communist movement on the ideological front of our country. Every one of our cultural and art workers should become a promoter and the most active propagandist of this movement. We must constantly transform and improve our thinking with Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, we must widely publicize Mao Zedong Thought through literary and artistic creation and various cultural and artistic activities, so that Mao Zedong Thought can be mastered by more of the people, so as to promote our socialist and communist cause. This is the solemn and lofty responsibility of every revolutionary cultural and art worker.

Qian Junrui emphasized that our culture and art must more actively support agricultural production and serve the peasants. Actively supporting agriculture with culture and art and strengthening service to peasants is a fundamental policy issue concerning the path and speed of our socialist construction, the consolidation and development of the worker-peasant alliance in our country, and the prosperity of our country's scientific and cultural undertakings. He pointed out that since liberation, we have carried out a large-scale cultural popularization work in rural areas and achieved great results. However, if we elevate cultural and artistic support for agriculture to the fundamental policy of the entire national construction and cultural construction, and to the height of cultural revolution, then the work we have already done is only a beginning, and it can be said that it is still very little compared to the needs. We must further strengthen the work of cultural support for agriculture. All cultural and art departments should formulate a relatively long-term plan to serve agricultural production and popularize cultural and art work in rural areas, and specific plans for phased implementation. Our culture and art must promptly and correctly reflect the new people and new things in rural areas, focus on creating heroic images with a communist style, disseminate advanced experiences in increasing agricultural production, promote the great superiority of rural people's communes, and publicize the mutual support and joint leap forward of industry and agriculture, cities and villages, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. Cultural and art groups should be linked to counties, people's communes, and production teams as much as possible, and support agriculture in terms of manpower, material resources, and spiritual food, and more systematically adapt cultural and art work to the needs of peasants, so that cultural and art workers can further integrate with the peasant masses. In the mass movement of cultural support for agriculture, we should further develop and consolidate various amateur cultural organizations and cultural undertakings in rural areas. We suggest that our writers, artists, and all cultural and art workers quickly create a literary and artistic creation and propaganda movement that penetrates deeply into rural areas and supports agriculture, and push the work of supporting agriculture in all walks of life to a new upsurge. At the same time, he pointed out that cultural and artistic support for agriculture must pay special attention to guaranteeing agricultural labor, and should be conducive to production rather than hindering production. The commune cultural work troupe must adhere to the principle of amateurism, and members of the cultural work troupe must not be allowed to leave production or leave production in disguise. The performances of theatrical troupes and film teams should not be too many or too long.

Qian Junrui said that our cultural and artistic work must also vigorously serve the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution in accordance with the spirit of mutual coordination and mutual promotion between the cultural revolution and the technical revolution. While serving agriculture, technical innovation and technical revolution, we must also closely cooperate with the work of eliminating illiteracy, popularizing education, hygiene, and sports in urban and rural areas, and push the cultural revolution to a new upsurge.

Qian Junrui said that the basic purpose of the cultural revolution is to intellectualize the workers and peasants and to laborize the intellectuals. In order to realize the intellectualization of workers and peasants, in addition to vigorously developing and strengthening the work of popularizing culture among the workers and peasants by professional cultural teams, we must also implement the policy of walking on two legs, and correctly combine popularization and improvement, professionalism and amateurism. We should vigorously carry out amateur literary and artistic creation and cultural activities among workers and peasants, and earnestly strengthen guidance to them. We should adhere to the direction of serving workers, peasants and soldiers in literature and art, adhere to the policy of serving politics, serving production, and serving the central work, adhere to the principles of amateur voluntarism, diligence and thrift, flexibility and diversity, and small-scale focus, fully mobilize the broad masses of cadres and masses, and push the mass amateur cultural and artistic activities in cities and rural areas to a new stage of greater popularization and continuous improvement.

Qian Junrui then said that we must have a cultural and artistic team of the working class that is both red and expert. The key issue here is to realize the laborization of intellectuals. Its essence is to transform the thinking of cultural and art workers, so that in the common labor and struggle with workers and peasants, they gradually abandon the bourgeois world outlook, consolidate and establish the communist world outlook, and realize the complete transformation from bourgeois intellectuals to proletarian intellectuals. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, a cultural and artistic team with proletarian intellectuals as the backbone, which is both red and expert, has begun to take shape. In the future, we should continue to train, transform, and improve our cultural and artistic team along the path of laborization of intellectuals.

Qian Junrui said that in recent years, new forces have grown vigorously in our literary and art team, and some of them have already shown relatively prominent performances. In order to cultivate new forces in a more planned way throughout the country, it is necessary to greatly strengthen art education work. Local cultural administrative departments should, under the leadership of the local party committees, earnestly run art education in accordance with the overall planning and the policy of walking on two legs, and strive to establish a system in a certain period of time in each cooperation zone and most provinces, cities, and autonomous regions that is interconnected with higher, middle, and primary art schools, combines long-term training and short-term training, and combines full-time schools with part-work and part-study schools and amateur schools, and that has basically complete professional settings and is basically complete. cultural and artistic education system.

Qian Junrui finally discussed that the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of cultural and artistic work. He emphasized that in order to victoriously and thoroughly realize the Party's cultural revolution program, it is necessary to further consolidate and strengthen the Party's leadership over cultural and artistic work, and resolutely oppose any tendency to weaken or deviate from the Party's leadership.

    文艺工作者要为彻底实现  党的文化革命纲领而斗争
    文化部副部长钱俊瑞在全国文艺工作者代表大会上的书面发言摘要
    新华社8日讯　文化部副部长钱俊瑞今天以“文化艺术工作者要为彻底实现党的文化革命纲领而斗争”为题在中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会上做了书面发言。他号召文化艺术工作者要坚决依靠党的领导，永远做文化革命的促进派，争取意识形态领域内“兴无灭资”斗争的彻底胜利，更好地为发展生产服务，为实现工农群众知识化和知识分子劳动化而斗争。
    钱俊瑞在发言中首先表示衷心拥护陆定一同志代表党中央和国务院向大会的祝词，和周扬同志的报告。钱俊瑞回顾了从1953年9月中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会以来文化艺术工作在党中央和毛主席的领导下取得的光辉成就后，对文化艺术工作者必须永远做文化革命的促进派这个问题发表了意见。钱俊瑞说，我国人民正在掀起一个学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作、学习辩证唯物主义的热潮。这是我国思想战线上的一个伟大的共产主义运动。我们每一个文化艺术工作者，应该成为这个运动的促进派和最积极的宣传者。我们要用毛泽东思想来不断改造和提高自己的思想。同时，我们必须通过文艺创作和各种文化艺术活动，广泛宣传毛泽东思想，使毛泽东思想能为更多的人民群众所掌握，来促进我们的社会主义、共产主义事业。这是我们每个革命文化艺术工作者的庄严和崇高的责任。
    钱俊瑞强调指出，我们的文化艺术必须更积极地支援农业生产，为农民服务。文化艺术积极支援农业，加强为农民服务，是关系我们社会主义建设的道路和建设速度，关系我国工农联盟的巩固和发展，关系我国科学文化事业的繁荣的根本方针问题。他指出，解放以来我们曾在农村进行了规模巨大的文化普及工作，取得了很大成绩，但是，把文化艺术支援农业提到整个国家建设和文化建设的根本方针上来看，提到文化革命的高度来看，那么我们已经做的工作，还只是开始，同需要相比，可以说还做得很少。我们必须进一步加强文化支援农业的工作。各个文化艺术部门都应该订出一个为农业生产服务，在农村普及文化艺术工作的比较长期的规划，和分期实现的具体计划。我们的文化艺术必须及时地正确地反映农村的新人新事，着重创造具有共产主义风格的英雄形象，传播农业增产中的先进经验，发扬农村人民公社的伟大优越性，宣传工业和农业、城市和乡村的互相支援，共同跃进，巩固工农联盟。文化艺术团体应该和县、人民公社、生产队尽可能地挂钩，从人力、物力、精神食粮等方面支援农业，更有计划地使文化艺术工作适应农民的需要，使文化艺术工作者进一步和农民群众相结合。在文化支援农业的群众运动中，还应该进一步发展和巩固农村的各种业余文化组织和文化事业。我们建议我们的作家、艺术家和一切文化艺术工作者，迅速造成一个文化深入农村、支援农业的文艺创作和宣传运动，把各行各业支援农业的工作推向一个新的高潮。他同时指出，文化艺术支援农业，当前必须特别注意保证农业劳动力的问题，应有利于生产而不是妨碍生产。公社文工团必须坚持业余的原则，文工团员决不容许脱离生产或者变相脱离生产。剧团、电影队的演出，场次不能过多，时间不能过长。
    钱俊瑞说，我们的文化艺术工作同样必须根据文化革命和技术革命互相配合、互相促进的精神，大力为技术革新和技术革命运动服务。在为农业、技术革新和技术革命服务的同时，我们还要密切配合城乡的扫盲、普及教育、卫生、体育等项工作，把文化革命推进到新的高潮。
    钱俊瑞说，文化革命的基本目的，是使工农群众知识化和知识分子劳动化。为了实现工农群众知识化，除了要大力发展和加强专业文化队伍在工农群众中的文化普及工作以外，还必须实行两条腿走路的方针，把普及与提高、专业与业余正确地结合起来。我们应该大力开展工农群众的业余文艺创作和文化活动，并且切实加强对它们的辅导。我们应该坚持文艺为工农兵服务的方向，坚持为政治、为生产、为中心工作服务的方针，坚持业余自愿、勤俭办事、灵活多样、小型为主的原则，充分发动广大干部和群众，把城市和农村的群众业余文化艺术活动，推向一个更加普及和不断提高的新阶段。
    钱俊瑞接着说，我们必须有一支工人阶级的又红又专的文化艺术队伍。这里的关键问题是实现知识分子的劳动化，它的实质就是改造文化艺术工作者的思想，使他们在同工农群众的共同劳动和斗争中，逐渐抛弃资产阶级世界观，巩固和确立共产主义世界观，实现由资产阶级知识分子到无产阶级知识分子的彻底转变。几年以来，在党的领导下，一支以无产阶级知识分子为骨干的又红又专的文化艺术队伍，已经开始形成。今后我们应该继续沿着知识分子劳动化的道路，不断锻炼、改造和提高我们的文化艺术队伍。
    钱俊瑞说，这几年来，在我们文艺队伍里，新生力量蓬勃成长，其中有一些已经有比较突出的表现。为了在全国范围内更加有计划地培养新生的力量，必须大大加强艺术教育工作。各地文化行政部门应在当地党委领导下，按照全面规划和两条腿走路的方针，认真办好艺术教育，努力争取在一定时间内，在各协作区和大多数省、市、自治区，建立起一个高、中、初等艺术学校相互衔接的，长期培养和短期训练并举的，全日制学校与半工半读学校、业余学校并举的，专业设置基本齐全的基本上完整的文化艺术教育体系。
    钱俊瑞最后论述了党的领导是文化艺术工作取得胜利的根本保证。他着重指出，为了胜利地彻底实现党的文化革命纲领，必须进一步巩固和加强党对文化艺术工作的领导，坚决反对任何削弱或者脱离党的领导的倾向。
