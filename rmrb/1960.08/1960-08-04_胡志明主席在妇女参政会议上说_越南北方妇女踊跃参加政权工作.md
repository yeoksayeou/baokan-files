Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 2nd. Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam said at the Women's Participation Conference in North Vietnam on the 1st that since the liberation of North Vietnam, women have made significant progress in political, economic, cultural, and social aspects. Among these, one of the most significant advancements is the increasing number of women participating in political work.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that currently, women in North Vietnam have taken on important positions such as judges, presiding judges, and heads of administrative and public institutions at all levels. In the past, very few girls attended school, but now the number of female students in various middle schools, universities, and studying abroad is increasing day by day. This proves that the Vietnamese Party, government, and people attach great importance to the status of women.

The Women's Participation Conference in North Vietnam, held in Hanoi from July 29th to August 1st, was the first conference in the history of the Vietnamese women's movement to discuss the issue of women's participation in politics.

According to local newspapers, currently, women working in state organs in North Vietnam account for 30% of the total number of staff in state organs. Among the five thousand and sixty-nine villages, sixteen thousand one hundred and thirty-nine women were elected as members of the village people's councils; in the twenty-six provinces, three hundred and thirty-three members of the provincial people's councils are women. In this National Assembly, there are fifty-three female representatives, which is four times more than in the first National Assembly.

    胡志明主席在妇女参政会议上说
    越南北方妇女踊跃参加政权工作
    新华社河内2日电　越南民主共和国主席胡志明1日在越南北方妇女参政会议上说，自从越南北方解放以来，妇女们在政治、经济、文化和社会各方面都有了显著的进步。其中，最显著的进步之一是，参加政权工作的妇女越来越多。
    胡志明主席说，目前，越南北方妇女已经担负起了审判员、庭长及各级行政和事业单位的负责人等重要的职务；过去，女孩子们上学的很少，现在在各个中学、大学以及到国外去读书的女学生日益增加。这证明越南党、政府和人民非常重视妇女的地位。
    从7月29日到8月1日在河内召开的越南北方妇女参政会议，是越南妇女运动史上第一次讨论关于妇女参政问题的会议。
    据此间报纸报道，目前，越南北方在国家机关里工作的妇女占国家机关工作人员总数的30％。在五千零六十九个乡中，有一万六千一百三十九名妇女当选为乡人民议会委员；在二十六个省中，有三百三十三名省人民议会委员是妇女。在这届国会中，有妇女代表五十三人，比第一届国会增加了四倍。
