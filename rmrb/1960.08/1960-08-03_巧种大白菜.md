Cleverly Growing Chinese Cabbage
    Based on the situation in our region, there are three main keys to growing good Chinese cabbage: abundant fertilizer and frequent watering, high ridge planting, and elimination of pests.

    Why abundant fertilizer and frequent watering? Chinese cabbage is inherently a fertilizer-loving crop. Furthermore, in our region, it is mostly a secondary crop, and the previous crop has already absorbed and utilized the soil nutrients. If less fertilizer is applied, it will not meet the needs of Chinese cabbage's growth and development, resulting in loose hearts and even inability to form hearts, making it unsuitable for winter storage.

    Fertilizer must be dissolved in water to be well absorbed and utilized by Chinese cabbage. If there is not enough moisture, the cabbage roots will not absorb nutrients properly and will even burn the seedlings.

    Why change from flat furrow planting to high ridge planting? In the past, secondary crop Chinese cabbage in our region was mostly planted in flat furrows. After the cabbage seedlings emerge, they are small, making irrigation very inconvenient. After irrigation, if drainage is poor, soft rot disease can easily occur. Changing to high ridge planting can avoid the above shortcomings.

    巧种大白菜
    根据我区的情况，种好大白菜有这样三个主要关键：肥大水勤、高垅种植和消灭虫害。
    为什么要肥大、水勤？白菜本来就是一种喜肥作物，再加上在我区多是复种，前一茬作物已经吸收利用了土壤肥分，如果施肥少，就满足不了白菜生长发育的需要，使包心松软，甚至包不住心，不能贮藏过冬。
    肥料必须溶解在水里，才能被白菜很好地吸收利用。如果水分不够，白菜根吸收不上养料还会烧苗。
    为什么要改平畦种植为高垅种植？我区过去复种白菜多是平畦种植。白菜出苗后，由于苗小，淌水很不方便。淌水之后，如果排水不利，很容易发生软腐病。改为高垅种植后，就可以避免上述缺点。
