　　Nanjing, August 18th (From Our Newspaper) The Nanjing Woodworking Factory has adopted the method of queuing up item by item and examining each item carefully, comprehensively and meticulously inspecting the promotion and use of each renovation project, concentrating its efforts on overcoming the technical difficulties of projects that cannot be used normally, and rapidly applying usable renovation projects to production, greatly promoting the in-depth development of the technical revolution movement and the continuous leap forward in production.

　　Since the beginning of this year, the factory's technical revolution movement has achieved remarkable results. Through technical revolution, the degree of mechanization and power equipment have nearly doubled compared to the end of last year. However, although the production tasks have been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, the largest increase was in output value, while the output of the main products only increased by about 40%. The Party Committee considered this an important issue and, starting in early June, on the one hand, mobilized all the factory's employees to speak out freely; on the other hand, it organized a professional inspection team composed of responsible cadres from the Party, government, labor union, and the League, as well as personnel from various departments, technicians, and workers, to go deep into the workshops and groups to inspect the usage of each renovation project. Through inspection, it was found that some important renovation projects that could be promoted had not been put into use.

　　The factory Party Committee further organized forces to trace the roots and conduct a comprehensive analysis. It finally discovered that, in addition to ideological reasons, the main reason was that these projects had not yet passed the technical hurdles. For example, in relatively simple operating techniques such as sawing, planing, drilling, and chiseling, new machines and technologies were used relatively well, but in some more complex operations such as carving and edging, the efficiency of the new technologies could not keep up with manual labor.

　　Faced with these difficulties, the leading cadres adopted resolute measures, mobilized all the factory's employees to offer suggestions and ideas for important projects, and set off a new upsurge in the technical revolution. The factory Party Committee also transferred eight technicians and innovation experts to form a professional promotion team, which went to various workshops and worked with the workers to inspect equipment one by one, analyzing, researching, improving, and testing until it was completely up to standard and could be used normally. The Third Workshop had developed an automatic nailing machine in the spring of this year to replace manual nailing, but because the machine was bulky, not flexible, and slow in speed, its efficiency was still not as good as that of skilled workers, so it had not been widely used. Recently, the cadres and workers of this workshop, together with the promotion team, dissected the nailing machine, identified seven key problems, and made relatively large-scale reforms, reducing the machine's volume by one-third and increasing its speed by more than twofold. Workers competed to use it. In less than half a month, six more were produced, enabling the workshop to fully realize mechanized nailing. In this way, 88 out of the 92 renovation equipment created by the factory this year have been put into normal use. The output in July increased by 20% compared to June, the quality reached 99.8%, and twenty-four new products were added.

### 一项一项地检查　一台一台地解剖　一件一件地改进  南京木器厂狠抓革新关键项目

    一项一项地检查　一台一台地解剖　一件一件地改进
    南京木器厂狠抓革新关键项目
    本报南京18日电　南京木器厂采取条条排队、项项过堂的办法，全面细致地检查每一项革新项目的推广使用情况，集中力量攻破不能正常使用项目的技术难关，使能使用的革新项目迅速用于生产，大大促进了技术革命运动的深入发展和生产的持续跃进。
    今年以来，这个厂的技术革命运动取得了显著成就，通过技术革命，机械化程度和动力设备都比去年年底增加了近一倍，但生产任务虽然全面提前超额完成，增加幅度最大的还是产值，主要产品的产量只增加了百分之四十几。党委认为这是一个重要问题，它说明还有许多增产潜力没有挖掘出来，随即从6月初开始，一方面发动全厂职工大鸣大放；另一方面组织了一支由党政工团负责干部、科室人员、技术人员和工人参加的专业检查队伍，深入到车间、小组检查每件革新项目的使用情况。通过检查，发现一部分能够推广的重要的革新项目没有使用起来。
    厂党委就进一步组织力量追根究源，进行全面分析，终于发现除了思想上的原因以外，主要原因是这些项目在技术上还没有过关，例如：在锯、刨、钻、凿等比较简单的操作技术上，新机器和新技术使用都比较好，但是一些较复杂的如雕刻、镶边等操作，新技术的效率还跟不上手工。
    在这些难题面前，领导干部采取坚决的措施，发动全厂职工针对重要项目，献计献策，掀起了技术革命的新高潮。厂党委并抽调了八名技术员和革新能手，组成一支专业推广队，到各车间和工人一起，逐台检查设备，边分析、边研究、边改进、边试用，一直到完全过关、能够正常使用为止。三车间在今年春季曾经搞出了一台自动钉箱机，代替手工钉箱，但是由于这台机器体积大，不灵巧，转速慢，效率还赶不上技术熟练的工人，因而一直没有推广使用。最近，这个车间的干部和工人、推广队一道，解剖了钉箱机，找出了七大关键，并进行了比较大的改革，使这台机器体积缩小了三分之一，转速提高了二倍多，工人争着使用。不到半个月又仿制了六台，使这个车间全部实现了钉箱机械化。这样，使全厂今年以来所创造的九十二台革新设备，有八十八台正常使用起来。7月份的产量比6月份增加了20％，质量达到99.8％，并增加了二十四种新产品。
