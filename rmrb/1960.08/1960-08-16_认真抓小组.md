    Conscientiously Grasp the Small Groups

    After the leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises go deep into the front line of production, where should they start and how should they grasp the work? The Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai provides us with a good experience, that is, to conscientiously grasp the small groups.

    After workers participate in the management of enterprises, the small group is not only the basic-level organization of production in industrial and mining enterprises, but also the basic-level organization of administrative management. The small group is both a "sparrow" that centrally reflects various tasks of the enterprise, and a unified body of production, life, and study for the small group members; it is both the starting point of the vigorous mass movement and the foothold for doing various tasks in a down-to-earth manner. Only with deep roots can the foliage flourish. Only by going deep and grasping the work of the small groups can the completion of production tasks be implemented. Strengthening the work of the small groups and improving the leadership level of the small groups will provide a solid foundation for further implementing the policy of combining vigorous mass movements with centralized leadership in enterprises.

    To grasp the small groups, we must grasp both ends, that is, both the advanced and the backward. The difference between advanced and backward always exists. Grasping the advanced is not only to promote it to be more advanced, but also to drive the backward to catch up. Therefore, both the advanced and the backward must be grasped. Of course, what to focus on during a certain period should be determined according to the specific situation of the enterprise at different times. One of the important tasks of cadres in grasping the small groups is to help the backbone members of the small groups improve their leadership level, help the advanced small groups summarize their work experience, and use it to guide the general, so that more small groups can rise to the level of advanced small groups.

    To grasp the small groups well, we must grasp them comprehensively. The Jiangnan Shipyard summarized the experience of the advanced small groups and summarized it into five characteristics: comprehensively grasping ideology, comprehensively grasping production, comprehensively grasping innovation, comprehensively grasping management, and comprehensively grasping life. This is a very important experience. Why do some enterprises sometimes experience fluctuations in production? Analyzing it, a very important reason is that the grasp is not comprehensive, that is, there is one-sidedness in the work method. Only by grasping it comprehensively can production be high-yielding, fast, good, and economical, and can safe production, work and rest, and continuous leap forward be achieved. However, if we do not go deep into the grassroots of production, it is bound to be difficult to grasp comprehensively. Because without going deep, we will not have a deep understanding of the reality of production, and it is very likely that we will grasp one end and lose the other. For example, if we grasp innovation but relax management, the results of innovation will not be guaranteed by strong management work, and the superiority of innovation will still not be brought into play. For another example, if we only grasp the processing link in innovation and grasp the raw material link less or not at all, the effect of innovation will inevitably be poor. Grasping the "sparrow" of the small group and deeply dissecting this "sparrow" can make our understanding more comprehensive, gradually avoid one-sidedness, and make the enterprise's production steadily increase.

    The work of the small groups must be grasped comprehensively, but the key issue is to grasp ideology. Why have some small groups not used the good experiences already available from advanced small groups? Or why have they adopted some methods of advanced small groups but they have not worked? One of the important reasons is that ideological problems have not been well resolved. Experience has proven that only by grasping management, grasping the division of labor, grasping comprehensive arrangements and other systems and measures on the basis of grasping ideology can these systems and measures truly produce practical results. Putting politics in command and letting ideology lead the way has a powerful promoting effect on material production. This truth has been proven by countless facts in enterprises. One proof is that the Jiangnan Shipyard has steadily increased production as a result of putting emphasis on ideological work, improving democratic life, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism as the top priority in grasping the small groups.

    One labor, two talks, three studies, four helps, and five promotions: This is a successful set of methods for the Jiangnan Shipyard to grasp the small groups. Through "one labor, two talks," cadres learn about the opinions of grassroots cadres and the masses on production, study, life, and other aspects, and truly exchange ideas with the masses and become one with them. "Help" in "study." That is to say, in learning from grassroots cadres and the masses, we must be good at discovering contradictions, analyzing contradictions, and inspiring and helping grassroots cadres improve their leadership level, inspiring and helping the masses improve their socialist and communist consciousness, and use the method of summarizing experience to achieve the purpose of improving and consolidating the small groups. Only by being a good student can we be a good teacher; only by first being an ordinary worker can we be a good leader. This truth has also been proven by the leading cadres of the Jiangnan Shipyard in their practice of going deep into the grassroots to grasp the small groups. In each of our enterprises, there are some relatively advanced small groups. The leaders and backbone members of these advanced small groups have accumulated some experience in their actual work. As long as the leading cadres humbly learn from them after going deep into the front line of production, earnestly explore their experience, help them learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, summarize and improve their experience, consciously grasp the laws of small group work, and form the core of leadership of the small groups, they can raise the work of the small groups to a higher level. "Helping" is for "promoting." The leading organization should also promote the summarized experience of the small groups to more small groups through competitions. In the past, some industrial and mining enterprises also promoted the experience of advanced small groups and achieved great results; however, it is true that some leaders did not know the advanced experience they promoted deeply, so they naturally did not promote it effectively. It can be seen that to do a good job in promotion, without a process of "labor, talk, study, help" to make ourselves have a deep and thorough understanding of the reality of production, we cannot "promote" it well.

    Is grasping the small groups only to strengthen the small groups themselves and better exert the role of the small groups in enterprise management? It's not just that. Grasping the small groups can also play a greater role, that is, improving leadership style and improving leadership level. Leading cadres go deep into the small groups, on the one hand, to help the work of the small groups improve, so that the vigorous mass movement has a broader and more solid foundation, and so that political and ideological work and economic work can be done more and more meticulously; on the other hand, the small groups can also become a mirror, from which we can see the enterprise's leadership, the work of the workshops and departments. From this mirror, we can find problems that cannot be seen in the office, and prompt us to take measures to solve them quickly. Grasping the small groups and improving leadership are two aspects of the same issue. By grasping the small groups, we can help grassroots cadres do their work well, and at the same time, we can further improve the leadership work of the enterprise. Whether the leader's calls and arrangements are practical? What is the actual effect? We need to test it in the grassroots work. How can leaders correctly propose new slogans and correctly arrange new tasks? We must also grasp the situation at the grassroots level in advance. After the leaders conscientiously grasp the small groups, they will inevitably find many strengths and weaknesses in the grassroots cadres' work style and work methods, and they will also inevitably find the problems existing in the small groups. The emergence of these problems is not entirely due to the grassroots cadres' work style and work methods, but is inseparable from the problems existing in the enterprise management, department work, and workshop and factory-level leadership. Some shortcomings in the work of the small groups often reflect the shortcomings in the leadership work and the unsoundness of certain links in the enterprise. The small group is the cell of the enterprise. To do a good job in the small group and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and initiative of each worker depends not only on the small group itself, but also on the relationship between the small group and the factory-level leadership, the workshop leadership, the departments, and other small groups. To grasp the small groups well, we must correctly handle the relationship between the small groups and all parties. The work of the small groups is strengthened, and the overall leap forward is achieved, which also requires the leadership work to fully keep up, and requires the work of the workshops and departments to adapt to it. That is to say, through grasping the small groups, we must improve the mutual relationship between the upper and lower levels, improve the style and methods of enterprise leadership, so that the relations of production are further adapted to the productive forces, and the superstructure is further adapted to the economic base, thereby promoting the sustained leap forward of the entire enterprise's production. This is also one of the most important purposes of emphasizing that the leading cadres of enterprises must grasp the work of the small groups after going deep into the front line of production.

### 认真抓小组

    认真抓小组
    工矿企业的领导干部深入生产第一线以后，究竟应该从何着手，怎样抓法呢？上海江南造船厂为我们提供了一个好经验，这就是认真地抓小组。
    工人参加企业的管理以后，小组不仅是工矿企业生产的基层组织，而且也是行政管理的基层组织。小组既是集中反映企业各项工作的一只“麻雀”，又是小组成员生产、生活、学习的一个统一体；既是轰轰烈烈的群众运动的起点，又是踏踏实实做好各项工作的落脚点。根深才能叶茂，只有深入下去，抓好小组工作，生产任务的完成才能落实。加强了小组工作，提高了小组的领导水平，在企业里进一步贯彻大搞群众运动与集中领导相结合的方针才有坚实的基础。
    抓小组，要抓两头，即既抓先进，也抓落后。先进与落后的差别，总是经常存在的。抓先进，不只是推动它更先进，而且是为了带动落后的赶上来。所以，先进与落后必须都抓。当然，在一个时期内，着重抓什么，这要根据企业不同时期的情况来决定。干部抓小组的重要任务之一，就是帮助小组骨干提高领导水平，帮助先进小组总结工作经验，用以指导一般，把更多的小组上升到先进小组的水平。
    抓小组要抓得好，必须全面抓。江南造船厂把先进小组经验加以总结，归纳为全面抓思想、全面抓生产、全面抓革新、全面抓管理、全面抓生活等五个特点，这是一条很重要的经验。为什么有的企业生产有时出现波动的情况呢？分析起来，一个很重要的原因是抓而不全，也就是工作方法上有片面性。只有全面抓起来，生产才能又多又快又好又省，又安全生产，有劳有逸，持续地跃进。可是，如果不深入生产的基层，要想抓得全面，是必然困难的。因为不深入下去对生产实际不深知深解，就极有可能抓住一头，丢掉一头。比如，抓了革新松了管理，结果，革新的成果得不到强有力的管理工作的保证，革新的优越性仍然不能发挥出来。再比如，在革新中只抓加工环节，不抓或少抓原料环节，革新的效果也必然不好，而抓好小组这个“麻雀”，深入解剖这个“麻雀”，就能使自己的认识更加全面，就能逐渐避免片面性，使企业的生产稳步上升。
    小组工作，必须全面抓好，但关键问题是抓思想。为什么有些小组没有运用先进小组已有的好经验？或者采用了先进小组的某些办法而没有起作用？重要的原因之一是思想问题尚未很好解决。经验证明，只有在抓思想的基础上来抓管理、抓分工、抓全面安排等制度和措施，才能使这些制度和措施真正产生实际效果。政治挂帅、思想先行对于物质生产具有强大的促进作用，这个真理，在企业里已被无数的事实证明了。江南造船厂由于把重视做思想工作，健全民主生活，开展批评与自我批评放在抓小组的首位，结果促进了生产稳步上升，就是证明之一。
    一劳、二谈、三学、四帮、五推，这是江南造船厂抓小组的一套成功的办法。通过“一劳、二谈”，干部了解到基层干部和群众对生产、学习、生活等各方面的意见，和群众真正在思想上相互交流，打成一片。在“学”中去“帮”。这就是说在向基层干部、向群众学习中，要善于发现矛盾，分析矛盾，并启发和帮助基层干部提高领导水平，启发和帮助群众提高社会主义和共产主义觉悟，并且用总结经验的方法，达到健全和巩固小组的目的。只有做好学生，才能做好先生；只有首先是一个普通劳动者，才能做好一个领导者。这个真理也是江南造船厂的领导干部在深入基层抓小组的实践中所证明了的。我们每个企业中都有一些比较先进的小组，这些先进小组的组长和骨干分子已经在实际工作中积累了一些经验，只要领导干部在深入生产第一线后，虚心向他们学习，认真地发掘他们的经验，帮助他们取长补短把经验配套成龙，总结提高，自觉地掌握小组工作的规律，并形成小组的领导核心，就能把小组工作提到更高的水平。“帮”是为了“推”。领导组织还应该把总结出来的小组经验通过竞赛形式，推广到更多的小组去。过去有些工矿企业单位也曾推广过先进小组的经验，取得不小的成绩；但也确有些领导人员由于对推广的先进经验本来就知之不深，自然也就推之不力，由此可见，要做好推广工作，没有一个“劳、谈、学、帮”的过程，使自己对生产实际深知深解，也是“推”不好的。
    抓小组，是不是仅仅为了加强小组本身和更好地发挥小组在企业管理中的作用呢？不只是这样。抓小组，还能起更大的作用，这就是改进领导作风，提高领导水平。领导深入小组，一方面帮助小组工作健全起来，使大搞群众运动有了更广泛、更坚实的基础，使政治思想工作、经济工作能愈做愈细致；另一方面小组还能成为一面镜子，从小组看企业领导，从小组看车间、科室的工作，从这面镜子中能够发现在办公室中看不到的问题，促使我们采取措施，迅速解决。抓好小组和改进领导，这是一个问题的两个方面。通过抓小组，能够帮助基层干部做好工作，同时也能进一步改进企业的领导工作。领导的号召、布置是否切合实际？效果究竟如何？要在基层的工作中去检验。领导怎样才能正确地提出新的口号，正确地布置新的任务？也必须事先掌握基层的情况。领导认真地抓了小组之后，必然会发现基层干部在工作作风、工作方法上的许多长处和缺点，也必然会发现小组中存在的问题，而这些问题的产生又不完全是由于基层干部的工作作风和工作方法，而是和企业管理、科室工作以及车间和厂一级的领导上存在的问题分不开的。小组工作中的一些缺点往往反映了领导工作中的缺点和企业中某些环节的不健全。小组是企业的细胞，要搞好小组工作，充分调动每个工人的积极性、主动性，就不仅取决于小组本身，同时也取决于小组与厂一级领导、与车间领导、与科室以及其他小组的相互关系。要抓好小组，就必须正确处理小组与各方面的关系。小组工作加强了，全面跃进了，也要求领导工作全面跟上去，要求车间以及科室工作与之相适应，这就是说，要通过抓小组，改进上下左右之间的相互关系，改进企业领导的作风和方法，使生产关系与生产力、上层建筑与经济基础进一步相适应，从而促进整个企业生产的持续跃进。这也是我们强调企业的领导干部深入生产第一线后，必须抓好小组工作的一个最主要的目的。
