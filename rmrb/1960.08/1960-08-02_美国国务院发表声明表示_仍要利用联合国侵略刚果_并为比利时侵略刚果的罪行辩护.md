Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 31st - The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 30th defending Belgium's aggression against the Congo and stating that the United States would continue to use the United Nations to pursue its aggressive conspiracy in the Congo.

The State Department's formal statement said that it believed Belgium's dispatch of troops to the Congo "had no aggressive intent" but was for so-called "protection of life," and it was "satisfied" with this.

The State Department's statement also expressed "satisfaction" with the Belgian cabinet's announcement on the 29th that it was preparing to "withdraw" only 1,500 troops "in the coming days" from its 10,000 invading troops in the Congo.

The statement also hoped that Belgium's announcement of measures to withdraw only 1,500 troops "will lead to the re-establishment of an atmosphere of cooperation and trust between Belgium and the Congo."

State Department spokesman White said on the 29th, in response to reporters' questions about whether the United States supports the Congo's opposition to Belgian aggression, that the United States "does not support either side" in the Congo situation. "We support the efforts of the United Nations."

    美国国务院发表声明表示
    仍要利用联合国侵略刚果
    并为比利时侵略刚果的罪行辩护
    据新华社31日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院30日发表声明，为比利时侵略刚果辩护，并表示美国要继续利用联合国，在刚果推行它的侵略阴谋。
    国务院的这项正式声明说，它认为比利时派遣军队前去刚果“没有侵略意图”而是为了所谓“保护生命”，并对这一点“感到满意”。
    国务院的声明还对比利时内阁在29日宣布的它准备“在今后几天内”从它在刚果的一万名侵略军队中只“撤退”一千五百人的决定表示“满意”。
    声明还希望比利时宣布只撤退一千五百名军队的措施“将导致在比利时和刚果之间重新建立起合作和信任的气氛”。
    国务院发言人怀特29日在回答记者所问美国是否支持刚果反对比利时的侵略的问题时曾经说，美国在刚果局势中“不支持任何一方。我们支持联合国的努力”。
