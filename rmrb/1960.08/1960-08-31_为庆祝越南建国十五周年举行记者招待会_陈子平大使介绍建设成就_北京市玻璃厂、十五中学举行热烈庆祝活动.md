Xinhua News Agency, August 30th: Vietnamese Ambassador to China, Chen Ziping, held a press conference today. He told Chinese journalists in Beijing that the Vietnamese people, who are celebrating the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, must achieve even greater victories in the construction of socialism in North Vietnam and in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Ambassador Chen Ziping said: "If the Vietnamese people want to maintain peace and unify the motherland, they must resolutely launch a struggle against US imperialism. We regard the struggle against US imperialism as the most important revolutionary struggle, a struggle to defend national independence, unity, and to maintain peace."

Ambassador Chen Ziping described in detail the glorious course of the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle, and cited facts to introduce the achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He said that socialist relations of production in North Vietnam have occupied a leading position in the national economy. At present, 65% and 53% of the laboring farmers in the plains and mountainous areas respectively have joined agricultural production cooperatives. Private capitalist industry and commerce that have been subjected to socialist transformation have reached 98%. Handicraft laborers and small vendors have also been basically organized. Compared with 1955, the total output value of agricultural production in North Vietnam increased by 52.6% in 1959. The average agricultural output per capita has jumped to the top of Southeast Asian countries, and the total industrial output value has increased sevenfold, having established an industrial foundation capable of manufacturing some means of production and consumer goods. The material and cultural living standards of the working people have improved significantly.

When introducing the situation in South Vietnam, Ambassador Chen Ziping pointed out that US imperialism and its running dogs, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, are stepping up their efforts to undermine the Geneva Accords, plotting to turn South Vietnam into a new type of colony and military base of US imperialism. The people of the South are living in the disasters caused by the brutal rule of the US-Ngo group. The Ambassador pointed out: "Obviously, US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world."

Xinhua News Agency, August 30th: Workers at the Beijing Glass Factory and teachers and students at Beijing No. 15 Middle School held rallies today to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Vietnamese guests, including Vietnamese Ambassador to China Chen Ziping, the head of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation, Chen Huy Lieu, and all members of the delegation, attended the rally held by the Beijing Glass Factory tonight. They were warmly welcomed by more than 700 workers from the factory.

Lan Qiong, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Beijing Glass Factory, spoke at the meeting. First, on behalf of all the factory's employees, he extended warm congratulations to the Vietnamese guests on the festival. He talked about the remarkable achievements made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in socialist construction and socialist transformation over the past fifteen years. He said that the Vietnamese people have long experience in anti-imperialist struggle, and the US imperialist conspiracy to obstruct and undermine Vietnamese reunification will surely be crushed by the Vietnamese people. Chen Huy Lieu, head of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation, also spoke at the meeting. He introduced the socialist construction and socialist transformation in North Vietnam, the bloody rule of the US-Ngo reactionary clique in South Vietnam, and pointed out that under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people will surely achieve complete victory in the struggle for the complete liberation of their territory and the peaceful reunification of their motherland. He also praised the unbreakable fighting friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people. Nguyen Van To, a representative of the Vietnamese interns at the factory, also spoke at the meeting. He said that he would continue to work hard to strengthen the friendship between the people of China and Vietnam. The Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation also presented the factory workers with gifts, including a photo of Chairman Mao and President Ho shaking hands intimately. A cultural program was performed after the meeting.

Chen Zhongkuo, Counselor of the Vietnamese Embassy in China, and all members of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation led by Chen Huy Lieu, attended the celebration held at Beijing No. 15 Middle School this morning. Zhao Yan, Principal of No. 15 Middle School, extended warm congratulations to the Vietnamese people on the festival in his speech at the meeting. Chen Huy Lieu, head of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation, introduced to the teachers and students of the school the happy learning life of students in North Vietnam and the dark situation of students in South Vietnam who were tragically deprived of schooling and poisoned by the decadent, yellow culture of US imperialism. Their speeches were warmly applauded by the audience.

    陈子平大使详细描述了越南人民革命斗争的光荣历程，并且列举事实介绍了越南民主共和国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的成就。他说，越南北方社会主义的生产关系已占国民经济的领导地位，目前，在平原和高山地区分别有65％和53％的劳动农户加入了农业生产合作社；得到社会主义改造的私营资本主义工商业已达到98％；手工业劳动者和小商贩也已基本组织起来。1959年与1955年比较，越南北方农业生产的总产值增加52.6％；按人口平均计算的农业产量已跃居东南亚国家的首位，工业总产值增加七倍，已经建立了能够制造一部分生产资料和消费用品的工业基础。劳动人民的物质文化生活水平有了显著的提高。
