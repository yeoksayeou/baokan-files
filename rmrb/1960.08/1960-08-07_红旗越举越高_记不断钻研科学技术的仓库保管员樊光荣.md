    Holding the Red Flag Higher
    ——On Warehouse Keeper Fan Guangrong’s Continuous Pursuit of Scientific Technology By our reporter Zhu Shi, Li Shiyi
    One day in May, the reporters came to the 512 Warehouse of Chengdu Trade Company. As soon as they entered the office, they saw on the front wall a wooden box containing rows of electricity meters, various sized light bulbs, switches, intercoms, and receivers. This, it turned out, was the control panel—the brain of the warehouse—of the “Ten-Defense Automation System” created by warehouse keeper Fan Guangrong with the support of the Party and the masses.
    Red, green, and other colored insulated wires extended from the top of the box, representing the nerves leading to the warehouse. When the administrator stores goods according to their different properties and characteristics, he adjusts the shared “normal body temperature” and “normal humidity” of the goods. He places easily flammable items and those vulnerable to insects and rodents together and installs instruments. Once the current is turned on, the control panel automatically starts working. If the temperature inside the warehouse rises, the mercury column in the conductive thermometer rises. When it reaches the warning line for "normal body temperature," the light on the control panel flashes on. The administrator immediately flips a switch, and the ventilator hums cheerfully, cooling the warehouse. When the ammeter indicating the “treatment situation” stops fluctuating, the administrator understands that the warehouse temperature has returned to “normal.” The indicator light goes off, the ventilator stops working, and the goods are safe and sound again. Similarly, if the goods contract "dampness disease," the hair hygrometer diagnoses it, and the infrared light turns on to dehumidify the goods. If there are insects or rodents in the warehouse, the ultraviolet light responsible for extermination turns on, and the chlorine gas cylinder opens, immediately killing them. In addition, the administrator can obtain reliable information from the control panel about wind, rain, flooding, and climate changes in the warehouse.
    This warehouse is a large non-staple food warehouse, storing millions of pounds of seasonal agricultural and sideline specialty non-staple foods that are sold year-round. In the past, a large-scale inventory turnover was required four times a year, totaling tens of millions of pounds. Hundreds of workers were busy processing, transporting, and storing goods every day. Now, there is no need for a large-scale inventory turnover four times a year. The number of processing workers has been greatly reduced. It has been replaced by scientific and automated management, saving annual expenses from 90,000 yuan, 180,000 yuan to 220,000 yuan this year. The warehouse is neat, clean, and orderly.
    Beginning Scientific Research
    In the summer of 1958, on one occasion, the warehouse had just received 100,000 pounds of daylilies. The technician suggested that they should be processed immediately to prevent mold and rot. The processing method was to unpack the 100,000 pounds of daylilies one by one, carry them into a sealed warehouse, fumigate them with sulfur, and then carry them into the storage warehouse. This would not only require 4,000 man-hours and more than 2,000 pounds of sulfur, but also lower the grade of the processed daylilies and sell them at a reduced price. In the end, the risk of mold and rot could not be avoided. At that time, warehouse keeper Fan Guangrong disagreed. He boldly told the technician that this method was unscientific. The technician, seeing an ordinary warehouse keeper talking about "science" in front of him, refused to accept it and said, "I am a technician. I am responsible to the company. If you disagree with the processing, give me a guarantee that it won't mold, so as to avoid unclear responsibilities in the future!"
    Although Fan Guangrong did not lose heart under the support of the Party branch and other comrades, he did not know how to "scientifically" manage these goods. So, he watched the daylilies during the day and guarded them at night. As a result, not only did he not come up with a solution, but he caught a bad cold. He went to the hospital to see a doctor, and the nurse took his temperature. Fan Guangrong suddenly thought of the daylilies and suggested to the Party branch that they buy a thermometer to measure the "temperature" of the daylilies as well. The Party branch strongly supported his suggestion.
    After several days of observation, Fan Guangrong discovered that the "temperature" of the daylilies was dropping rapidly. He analyzed the reason and found that the daylilies had been exposed to the sun and dew during transportation by car and boat, resulting in temperature increases. As long as they were placed in a cool and ventilated place, the temperature would drop, and the risk of mold and rot could be eliminated. Fan Guangrong not only found a way to store 100,000 pounds of daylilies without rotting a single pound, but also broke down superstitions, liberated his mind, and took a big step towards the entrance of science. Soon, he made simple microscopes, alcohol lamps, electric ovens, and hair hygrometers to investigate the internal structure and changes of the goods.
        High-Temperature Resistant Special Materials
    Fan Guangrong's creation made a big step forward in warehouse management, but he felt that he still had to spend a dozen people repeatedly "checking the health" of the goods every day, which was not in line with the spirit of the General Line. Wouldn't it be better if he could sit in the office and know the temperature changes of the goods in each warehouse, saving manpower and labor? Soon, he was inspired by an electronic thermometer in a factory and gave the imagined new instrument a name: "Conductive Thermometer."
    To make a "Conductive Thermometer," the technicians at the glass factory told him that he had to find platinum wire that could withstand high temperatures. Fan Guangrong thought that platinum wire would be hard to find. Could he find something else to replace it? At night, he tested copper wires, iron wires, and steel wires in front of the white-hot flame of a blowtorch. They all broke when they touched the flame, filling a table. Fan Guangrong felt very uncomfortable looking at it. At this difficult moment, he remembered the Party's teaching: Retreating on the battlefield of revolutionary war is a shameful act of desertion. He felt strength all over his body. The next day, he found a tungsten wire that could withstand high temperatures from the large light bulb on the steam furnace for repairing rubber shoes, overcoming the first hurdle. But in further experimentation and research, he encountered even greater difficulties.
    At that time, Fan Guangrong studied in his spare time and sought out teachers and sages. Once, he ran to the Sichuan Medical College to consult a professor. The professor first gave a lecture on the principles of electricity and finally said that if there were any difficulties in theory, he could help, but as for the thing he wanted to make, it was not in the books and had not been seen elsewhere, and seemed to lack a basis! Fan Guangrong went to the workers again. In the glass workshop of the affiliated factory of Sichuan University, he received enthusiastic support and help from the veteran workers. The workers worked with him day and night. When the experiment was unsuccessful, the Party branch of the warehouse mobilized all the comrades to work with him. After repeated failures, up to more than 150 failures, a full six pounds of thin glass tubes were burned. It was also in the failures that he mastered the secrets of this scientific technology, overcame numerous difficulties, and finally, in January of last year, the ideal "Conductive Thermometer" was born!
    Fan Guangrong installed it in the warehouse, turned on the current, and knew the temperature changes in the warehouse while sitting in the office. His wish came true.
    An Endless Road
    Following the "Conductive Thermometer," Fan Guangrong also made "Conductive Hygrometers," commodity stacking machines, and single- and double-boom cranes, making commodity storage increasingly scientific and mechanized. Under the education of the Party, Fan Guangrong worked harder to study culture, technology, and political theory. In his busy schedule, he successively read the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, high school physics and chemistry textbooks, the Soviet-published Methods, Organization, and Technology of Non-Staple Food Storage, and the Mechanics of Mechanical Transportation used in Soviet universities. Combining his own work experience, last year he also wrote a "Non-Staple Food Storage" book to present as a gift for the 10th anniversary of National Day.
    Fan Guangrong still felt that all this was not enough. After studying Chairman Mao's works, he responded to the Party's call to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, thinking about turning the "Conductive Thermometer" into an "automated" instrument. In April of this year, Fan Guangrong returned from the National Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution On-Site Conference in Chongqing. Inspired by the experiences of other units, he was thinking on the train about building an automated line that could automatically prevent heat, humidity, fire, insects, rodents, floods, report wind, rain, and weather, and then build a tracked automated line and a trackless automated line to solve the problem of transporting goods in and out of the warehouse, making storage work more scientific and easier. Therefore, the meeting to welcome Fan Guangrong's return turned into a meeting to discuss these three automated lines. All the comrades in the warehouse took action, and the Party at the higher level and other units also gave enthusiastic support. Fan Guangrong and his comrades worked together to solve the problem of the lack of raw materials, overcame numerous technical difficulties while learning on the job, and after working day and night, the good news finally came out that the three automated lines had been successfully tested!
    His deeds spread across the country like a spring breeze. More than a hundred groups of people from Shanghai, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, and many other regions came from thousands of miles away to learn from him. This year, during the "May Day" festival, Chairman Liu Shaoqi participated in celebration activities in Chengdu, received Fan Guangrong, listened to his report, and encouraged him to be a good housekeeper for the people. In June, he was honorably elected as a representative to the National Congress of Cultural and Educational Heroes. In Beijing, he brought the "Ten-Defense Automation System" instrument to participate in the National Technical Innovation Performance Conference. At the conference, due to new inspiration, he soon returned and made a "Radio Remote Control" automatic stacking machine. Recently, when the reporter saw him for the second time, he pointed to the radio transmitter in his hand and said: A new series of revolutions has begun... With this gadget, my "Ten-Defense Automation System" seems to be outdated again.

    红旗越举越高
    ——记不断钻研科学技术的仓库保管员樊光荣	本报记者朱实  李世义
    5月的一天，记者来到成都市贸易公司五一二仓库，一进办公室，就看见正面墙壁上有个装着一排排电表、大小灯泡、开关、传话器、听话器的木箱子。原来，这就是仓库管理员樊光荣在党和群众支持下创造的“十防自动线”的控制台——仓库的头脑。
    这箱子上方牵出红红绿绿的胶线，那是通到仓库去的神经。管理员将商品按不同性质、特点储存时，就调好了商品共同的“正常体温”和“正常湿度”，把易燃的和易遭虫、鼠危害的放在一起，装上仪器，等电流一通，控制台就自动工作起来。如果库内温度升高，导电温度计的水银柱便上升，当到达“正常体温”的警界线时，控制台上的灯光刷地亮了。管理员立即扳开一个开关，通风器便呜呜地欢唱着，为仓库退热。当指示“治病情况”的电表从游动中停下来，管理员明白了：仓库温度已恢复“正常”。指示灯熄了，通风器停止了工作，商品又安然无恙了。同样，商品如果得了“湿气病”，毛发湿度计诊断出来后，红外线灯亮起来，为商品去湿；如果库内有虫、鼠危害，负责灭杀的紫外线灯发亮，氯气瓶茅塞顿开，立即捕杀干净，如果有了火警，消防设备会加以扑灭。此外，凡是仓库里有风、雨、水涝、气候变化，管理员都会从控制台上得到可靠的情报。
    这个仓库是一个大型的副食品仓库，保管着数百万斤一季产、四季销的农副土特产副食品。从前，这里一年要大翻仓四次，总量高达一两千万斤，好几百工人成天为加工、搬运、保管商品奔忙。现在，这里再也不需要一年四次的大翻仓，加工工人已减到很少了，它已为科学的、自动化的管理所代替，每年节省的用费从九万元、十八万元直到今年的二十二万元。仓库里整齐、清洁，井井有条。	开始研究科学
    1958年夏天，有一次仓库刚收进十万斤黄花，技术员提出应该立即加工，防止霉烂，加工的办法就是将十万斤黄花一包包拆散，用人抬进密封仓，用硫磺熏后再抬到保管仓内。这样做不仅要花四千个人工、两千多斤硫磺，而且，加工后的黄花要降低等级，削价出售，最后，仍免不了霉烂的危险。当时，保管员樊光荣就不同意，他大胆向技术员说，这样的作法不科学。技术员看到一个普通的保管员在他面前谈“科学”，就不服气地说：“我是技术员，我要对公司负责，你不同意加工，就打张不会霉烂的保票给我，免得将来责任不清！”
    樊光荣在党支部和另一些同志的支持下，虽然并没有灰心，但究竟怎样才能“科学”地管理这些商品，也没有办法。于是，他白天瞧着黄花，晚上守着黄花睡觉。结果，不但没弄出个眉目来，倒反转弄了一身感冒病。他到医院去看病，护士给他量体温。樊光荣猛一下想起黄花，回去就向党支部建议，买支温度计来也给黄花量量“体温”。党支部对他的建议很支持。
    经过几天观察，樊光荣发现黄花的“体温”下降很快，分析原因，是黄花在沿途车船运输中，日晒夜露，冷热不调，以致温度增高，只要放在阴凉通风的地方，温度下降，即可免除霉烂的危险，樊光荣从这里不仅找到了保管十万斤黄花的办法，使它储存了一年没烂一斤，而且破除了迷信，解放了思想，使他向科学的入口处跨进了一大步，不久，他自制了简易显微镜、酒精灯、电烘箱、毛发湿度计来考察商品内部的组织和变化情况。
        耐高温的特殊材料
    樊光荣的创造，使仓库保管工作进了一大步，但他觉得每天还得花十几个人三番五次去给商品“检查身体”，不符合总路线的精神，如果坐在办公室就能知道每个仓库商品的温度变化情况，以节省人力和劳动，不是更好么？不久，他从某工厂的一个电子温度计上得到了启发，便给想像中的新仪器取了个名字：“导电温度计”。
    要做“导电温度计”，玻璃厂的技术员告诉他，得找能耐高温的白金丝才行。樊光荣心想，白金丝可难找呀，找别的东西代替不行吗？夜晚，他对着喷灯白热的火焰，把一根根铜丝、铁丝、钢丝拿来试验。它们一碰上火焰就都断了，满满地堆了一桌子。樊光荣看着，心里十分难受。在这困难的时刻，他想起了党的教导：在革命战争的战场上退却是可耻的逃兵。他就浑身上下有了力量。第二天，他从热补胶鞋蒸汽炉上的那支大灯泡上，找到了同样能耐高温的钨丝，克服了第一道难关。但在进一步试验研究时，却遇到了更大的困难。
    樊光荣当时一边抽空学习，一边寻师访贤。有一次他跑到四川医学院去请教一位教授。教授先讲了一阵电学的道理，最后表示，如果学理上有什么困难，他可以帮助，至于要做的东西，书上没有，别处也没见过，似乎太缺乏根据了！ 樊光荣又去找工人，在四川大学附属工厂的玻璃车间，得到了老工人的热情支持和帮助。工人们白天黑夜和他一起干。试验没有成功，仓库党支部又发动全体同志和他一起搞，一次又一次的失败，一直失败了一百五十多次，细玻璃管烧断了足足六斤。也就在失败中，他掌握了这方面科学技术的秘密，克服了重重困难，去年1月，理想中的“导电温度计”终于诞生了！
    樊光荣把它装在仓库里，通上电流，坐在办公室里便知道仓库温度的变化情况。他的愿望实现了。	没有止境的道路
    樊光荣继“导电温度计”之后，又制成了“导电湿度计”、商品堆码机、单杆和双杆起重机，使商品保管步步科学化、机械化。樊光荣在党的教育下也更加努力学习文化、技术和政治理论，在百忙中陆续读完了毛泽东选集、高初中物理、化学，苏联出版的副食品保管方法、组织与技术，苏联高等学校用的机械运输力学等。结合自己的工作经验，去年他还写了一本“副食品保管学”，向国庆十周年献礼。
    这一切，樊光荣还觉得不够，在他学习了毛主席的著作后，又响应党的开展技术革新、技术革命的号召，想着把“导电温度计”改成“自动化”的仪器。今年4月，樊光荣从重庆开完全国技术革新、技术革命现场会回来，从其他单位的经验得到启发，在火车上就想着搞一条自动线，能自动防热、防湿、防火、防虫、防鼠、防洪、报风、报雨、报告气象，然后再搞一条有轨自动线和无轨自动线，解决搬运进出仓问题，使保管工作更加科学、更加省事。于是，欢迎樊光荣归来的会变成了讨论这三条自动线的会，全仓库同志都行动起来了；上级党和其他单位也热情支持。樊光荣和同志们一起解决了原料材料缺乏的问题，在边干边学中克服了技术上的重重困难，经过日夜奋战，喜讯终于传出来，三条自动线试验成功了！
    他的事迹像春风一样吹遍全国，从上海、云南、陕西、新疆等许多地区不远千里而来的取经者不下百余起。今年“五一”节，刘少奇主席在成都参加庆祝活动，接见了樊光荣，听取了他的汇报，勉励他作好人民的当家人。6月份，他又光荣地被选为全国文教群英会代表。在北京，他带着“十防自动线”仪器，参加了全国技术革新表演会。在会上，由于受到了新的启发，他回来后不久，就制成了“无线电遥控”自动堆码机。最近，当记者第二次见到他时，他指着手上拿着的无线电发射机说：一系列新的革命又开始了……有了这家伙，我那“十防自动线”看来又落后了。
