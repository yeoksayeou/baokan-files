According to greatly reduced figures published by the Bonn National Bureau of Statistics, the number of West German handicraft workers who went bankrupt in 1959 exceeded 150,000.

The chairman of the West German Handicrafts Federation, Wilde, pointed out at a recent meeting of the Federation in Bad Godesberg that the number of handicraft enterprises in West Germany has decreased by 13% in the past decade.

Adenauer's Minister of Economic Affairs, Erhard, had to admit that West German handicraft workers have not received any financial assistance from the Bonn government.
