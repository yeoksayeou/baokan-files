Phonetic Literacy Can Also Be Promoted in Dialect Areas
Zhejiang Adopts a Teaching Method Combining Pinyin, Literacy, and Learning Mandarin, Achieving Success
National Children's Mandarin Recitation Competition Concludes with Fifteen Individual Awards

Xinhua News Agency - This newspaper reports that Zhejiang Province is comprehensively launching a phonetic literacy and Mandarin promotion campaign. According to incomplete statistics by the end of June, more than 6.3 million people in the province have participated in phonetic literacy and Mandarin learning.

Zhejiang's dialects are very complex, with each county having its own dialect. In the Wenzhou area, there are even six or seven different languages spoken within a single county, making communication difficult. Language barriers often create many difficulties for production, work, and cultural learning. Therefore, the masses have a very urgent need to learn culture and unify the language. Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on promoting phonetic literacy, a surge in phonetic literacy and Mandarin promotion has been set off across the province.

In the process of promoting phonetic literacy, Zhejiang has adopted a teaching method that combines Pinyin, literacy, and learning Mandarin, based on the characteristics of dialect areas. They use existing sounds in dialects to learn difficult syllables in Mandarin, paying attention to the comparison between dialects and Mandarin, and teaching the more difficult sounds separately to break through them one by one. At the same time, they also create "active tongues" and charts to visually help students master the pronunciation positions and methods. They learn Chinese characters through Pinyin, and learn Mandarin through phonetic literacy. Due to the adoption of the teaching method combining Pinyin, literacy, and learning Mandarin, the phonetic literacy movement has been widely and deeply carried out from cities and towns to rural areas, achieving remarkable results. After learning phonetic literacy, workers and peasants have greatly accelerated the work of eliminating illiteracy. In Zhuxi Production Team, Shangyu County, 212 young people learned Pinyin and recognized more than 700 Chinese characters through 47 hours of teaching. A women's literacy class in Zhu’ao Production Team, Linhai County, and Tianyang Civil School in Wenling County adopted the phonetic literacy teaching method, and after about 100 hours of teaching, they reached the standard for eliminating illiteracy, achieving the same results as in Mandarin-speaking areas in the north.

Xinhua News Agency, August 24th - The Ministry of Education, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Broadcasting Administration, and the Chinese Language Reform Committee recently jointly held a children's Mandarin recitation competition. According to the results, fifteen of the thirty-two participating children won individual awards, and one unit won a group award.

The ten provinces and one municipality participating in this Mandarin recitation competition are all areas with relatively complex dialects, and the participating children have only recently begun to speak Mandarin. However, judging from the results of this evaluation, children have actively responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League to learn Mandarin and have made great progress. Lian Xiaohong, the representative of Jiangsu Province who won first place, originally spoke a Yangzhou dialect. Last year, under the education of her teacher, she clarified the importance of speaking Mandarin and worked hard, carrying small cards with Pinyin letters written on them, and reciting them whenever she had free time. She created the "four more" learning method: read more (read in class, read after class, read at home), ask more (ask teachers, ask classmates), listen more (listen to the radio, listen to people speak, listen to dialogues in movies), and speak more (speak in class, speak after class, speak at home).

    方言地区也能推行注音识字
    浙江采取拼音、识字、学普通话三结合的教学方法获成效
    十省一市少年儿童普通话朗诵比赛结束十五人获个人奖
    本报讯  浙江省全面开展注音识字和推广普通话运动。到6月底的不完全统计，全省已有六百三十多万人参加了注音识字和普通话学习。
    浙江方言非常复杂，每个县都有自己的方言。温州专区甚至一县之内说六、七种话，彼此交谈都有困难。语言不通，往往给生产、工作和学习文化带来了很多困难，因此，广大群众对学习文化和统一语言的要求十分迫切。自中共中央发布关于推行注音识字的指示后，全省各地立即掀起了注音识字和推广普通话运动的热潮。
    浙江各地在推行注音识字过程中，根据方言地区的特点，采用拼音、识字、学普通话三结合的教学方法。他们利用方言中已有的音，去学习普通话中难发的音节，注意方言和普通话之间的对比，把比较难发的音分散教学，逐个突破。同时还制作“活动舌头”和图表，形象地帮助学员掌握发音部位和方法，通过拼音字母学习了汉字，同时又通过注音识字学会了普通话。由于采用了拼音、识字、学普通话三结合的教学方法，使注音识字运动从城镇到农村广泛深入地开展，获得了显著的成绩。工农群众学习注音识字之后，大大加速了扫除文盲工作。上虞县洙溪生产队二百一十二个青年，通过四十七小时的教学，就学会了拼音，并认识了七百多个汉字。临海县竹岙生产队的一个妇女扫盲班和温岭县田垟民校采用注音识字教学方法，经过一百个小时左右的教学，就达到了扫除文盲标准，取得了和北方话地区同样的效果。
    据新华社24日讯　教育部、共青团中央、广播事业局、中国文字改革委员会在最近联合举办了少年儿童普通话朗诵比赛。评比结果：参加比赛的三十二名少年儿童，有十五名获得个人奖，有一个单位获得了集体奖。
    参加这次普通话朗诵比赛的十省一市，都是方言比较复杂的地区，参加比赛的儿童都是不久前开始会说普通话的。但是从这次评比结果看，少年儿童响应团中央的号召积极学习普通话，已经取得了很大的成绩。获得第一名的江苏省代表练晓虹，原来讲一口扬州话，去年在教师的教育下，明确了讲普通话的重要意义，勤学苦练，随身带着写了拼音字母的小卡片，有空就拿出来念，创造了“四多”的学习方法：多读（课上读、课后读、家里读），多问（问教师，问同学），多听（听广播，听人讲，听电影里的对话），多讲（课上讲，课后讲，家里讲）。（附图片）
