　　This newspaper reports that after conducting in-depth investigations and research into the use of labor, leading cadres in Rong'an County, Guangxi, adopted effective measures to dramatically increase the labor force投入 in the front lines of agricultural production from 24% to 80%.

　　Before early June, Rong'an County often had only 15,000-plus laborers engaged in field production, and the progress of weeding and topdressing of early rice was very slow. The Rong'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China had convened several telephone conferences specifically to address this issue. However, the labor force still did not increase. What was the problem? The secretary of the county party committee secretariat and members of the county party committee personally went to production teams to conduct investigations and research. They found that the county's total rural labor force was 65,000, of which 7,860 were in county-run enterprises, infrastructure projects, and institutions, accounting for 12% of the total labor force; over 10,000 were in commune-run enterprises, accounting for 16.1% of the total labor force; over 28,000 were in commune and team sideline occupations and non-agricultural production support personnel, accounting for 43.4% of the total labor force; 3,000 were temporarily unable to participate in labor for various reasons, such as pregnant women and sick people; only 15,000-plus were actually participating in agricultural production, accounting for about 24%. It was clear that too few laborers were participating in field production, while too many laborers were transferred, occupied by commune-run enterprises, and used by production teams for non-agricultural production.

　　Why was it difficult to concentrate the labor force? Leading cadres of the county party committee further conducted in-depth investigations and visits, and studied the ideological situation of commune, brigade, and team cadres. They found that some problems existed in the thinking of commune, brigade, and team cadres. First, the idea of ​​agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link had not been truly established. In the specific implementation of transferring labor, they were unable to make up their minds. This was specifically manifested in the fact that some commune cadres were reluctant to compress or shut down enterprises with large profits; some commune cadres were unwilling to shut down certain enterprises and infrastructure projects, fearing that it would be difficult to restart them in the future. For example, some cadres, in order to complete the power station as soon as possible, were unwilling to stop the construction of the Siwei River Hydropower Station, which lacked materials, so more than 3,000 migrant workers were not transferred back to the production teams. Second, when the brigades implemented the regulations on suspending certain sideline productions, they feared that less sideline production would reduce cash income and affect distribution. In addition, some cadres' leadership style was not in-depth, they were only satisfied with the numbers reported from below, and did not conduct in-depth inspections of the real situation of labor concentration.

　　Having found the crux of the problem, the Rong'an County Committee immediately took measures to launch a large-scale debate on "agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link" throughout the county. It not only explained the great significance of this policy in terms of principles, but also explained, through accounting for labor, that the labor force must first ensure the needs of agricultural production in order to better implement this policy. Hongling Commune calculated an account: the commune's grain production task for this year was 4.45 million catties, and the labor force投入投入 in the current harvesting and planting tasks must ensure 2,200 people to complete the task. However, the labor force投入投入 in harvesting and planting in this commune was only 1,800 people, a shortfall of 400 people. If the labor force is not increased immediately, the season will be missed, and it will be difficult to achieve the annual production task. With a clear understanding of ideology, the commune party committee immediately compressed the labor force of non-agricultural production and made up for the labor force needed for harvesting and planting. At present, harvesting and planting are progressing quickly and well, and the over-production movement is in full swing.

　　On the basis of raising awareness and unifying thinking, the county party committee conducted a major inventory of the county's labor force and carried out comprehensive adjustments and arrangements based on the principle of priorities. First, resolutely compress county and commune enterprises and institutions, and transfer labor to enrich agricultural production. Hydropower stations, brick and tile factories, milk factories, wineries, paper mills, etc., which have little production relationship and temporarily lack materials, are temporarily suspended; forest farms and horticultural farms with similar properties that can be merged and managed are merged to reduce some of the labor force back to production teams for production; farm machinery factories, experimental farms, and livestock farms that are urgently needed for production should try to use urban residents and family members to replace the labor force transferred from rural areas; performing arts troupes and private schools should suspend activities and go to the fields for production. Second, drastically reduce the labor force of sideline production, and do more in slack seasons and less or none in busy seasons. Third, for non-agricultural production support personnel, adopt the method of replacing the weak with the strong, and send strong generals and elite soldiers to the front line of agricultural production. In addition, the county party committee also strengthened the leadership of the retained county and commune enterprises and professional teams, vigorously improved business management, and vigorously carried out technological innovations in order to further save labor.

　　After taking these measures, the labor force transferred back to the production team in the county increased exponentially. According to statistics, county-run enterprises and institutions freed up about 7,000 laborers, commune-run enterprises and brigade sideline businesses freed up more than 15,000 laborers, brigade non-agricultural production support personnel freed up more than 8,000 laborers, commune-downstream cadres and urban residents participated in agricultural production about 5,000 people, the county freed up a total of more than 35,000 laborers. At present, the labor force投入投入 in field production has increased to 52,000 people, reaching 80% of the total rural labor force. After the labor force was highly concentrated, it greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the broad masses in rural areas, and the speed of summer harvest and summer planting was greatly accelerated.

　　This newspaper reports that Nanhai County, Guangdong, has taken strong measures to adjust the labor force, effectively enriching the front line of agricultural production. Now the number of laborers engaged in field operations in the county has increased from the original 115,700 to more than 138,300; that is, from 57% of the total rural labor force to 69%.

　　When concentrating the labor force, the party organizations at all levels in Nanhai County first did a good job in political and ideological work, and vigorously publicized the idea that "agriculture is the foundation of national economic development" among cadres and the masses.

　　In rectifying the labor force, Nanhai County also focused on the following three links:

　　First, rectify the brigade labor organization in a planned way, strengthen labor management, and improve work efficiency. When rectifying the labor force, each production brigade adopted the method of "fixed personnel, fixed quotas, and fixed tasks" to rectify the professional teams. In this way, not only a large number of laborers were drawn from the professional teams, but also the normal production of each line was completely unaffected. After implementing this method, the Sanshan Brigade also promoted tool reform and improved work efficiency. For example, duck farming increased from 300 ducks per person to 400 ducks, melon and vegetable fields increased from 2 mu per person to 3 mu, pig raising increased from 60 pigs per person to 80 pigs, and fish pond management increased from 6 mu per person to 8 mu.

　　Second, vigorously organize urban workers' families, small vendors' families, cadres' families, and over-aged students to participate in agricultural production. As long as ideological work is done conscientiously, they are still willing to participate in labor. For example, the Xiaxi Brigade of Pingzhou Commune mobilized 128 urban laborers to participate in agricultural production in a few days. Their approach was to first hold a meeting to clarify policies, explain the principles, and then mobilize everyone to talk about their thoughts and opinions, and then arrange them specifically according to each person's labor conditions, each according to their abilities and talents. In this way, everyone is very satisfied.

　　Third, in addition to rectifying the labor organization and compressing the surplus labor force to support agricultural production, county and commune industries should also take measures to develop industries that directly serve agricultural production, reduce, decentralize, and abolish industries that are not closely related to the national economy and people's livelihood, and save labor to support agriculture.

　　In addition, it was also decided that the cadres of the production team should not be separated from production, and the rest of the cadres should eat, live, work, and discuss with the masses, and take the lead in labor; this will not only increase the labor force, but also greatly close the relationship between cadres and the masses.

    树立以农业为基础以粮为纲思想　分别轻重缓急合理安排劳力
    融安迅速集中劳力加强田间生产
    南海采取有效措施从各方面抽调劳力加强第一线
    本报讯　广西融安县领导干部深入基层，调查研究劳动力使用情况后，采取了有效的措施，使全县投入农业生产第一线的劳动力从24％激增至80％。
    6月初以前，融安县投入田间生产的劳动力经常只有一万五千多人，早稻的耘田追肥进度非常缓慢。中共融安县委为解决这个问题，曾专门召开过几次电话会议。但是，劳动力还是上不去。问题在哪里？县委书记处书记和县委委员都亲自深入生产队进行调查研究，发现全县农村总劳动力共有六万五千人，其中县办企业、基建工程和事业单位有七千八百六十人，占总劳动力12％；社办企业有一万多人，占总劳动力16.1％；用于社、队副业及非农业生产的后勤人员有二万八千多人，占总劳动力43.4％；因各种原因，如孕妇、病号等暂时不能参加劳动的有三千人；实际参加农业生产的只有一万五千多人，占24％左右。显而易见，参加田间生产的劳动力太少，而上调的劳动力、社办企业占用的劳动力、生产队用于非农业生产的劳动力占用太多。
    劳动力迟迟集中不起来，问题究竟在哪里？县委领导干部又进一步深入调查、访问，研究了公社、大队和小队干部的思想情况，发现公社、大队和小队干部思想上存在一些问题。首先是以农业为基础、以粮食为纲的思想没有真正树立，在具体执行抽调劳动力的问题就下不了决心。这具体表现在有些公社干部对收益大的企业，舍不得压缩或停办；也有些公社干部对某些企业、基建工程不愿下马，怕以后上马不容易。例如有些干部为了早日建成发电站，不愿停建缺材料的泗维河水电站，因此三千多民工没有抽回生产队来。其次是大队在执行暂停某些副业生产的规定时，怕少搞副业减少现金收入，影响分配。此外，有些干部领导作风不深入，只满足于下面汇报的数字，不深入检查劳力集中的真实情况。
    找到了问题的症结，融安县委立即采取措施，在全县范围内开展了“以农业为基础、以粮食为纲”的大辩论。不仅从道理上说明这一方针的重大意义，而且通过算劳动力账，说明劳动力必须首先保证农业生产的需要，才能更好地贯彻执行这一方针。红岭公社算了一笔账：全社今年粮食包产任务四百四十五万斤，按当前收种任务投入的劳动力必须保证二千二百人才能完成任务。但是，这个社投入收种的劳动力仅有一千八百人，还差四百人。如果不立即增加劳动力，就会误过节令，再要实现全年包产任务就有困难。思想认识清楚了，公社党委立即压缩了非农业生产的劳动力，补足了收种所需的劳动力。目前，收种进行得又快又好，超包产运动搞得热火朝天。
    在提高认识统一思想的基础上，县委对全县劳动力实行大盘点，根据轻重缓急的原则，进行全面调整和安排。第一，坚决压缩县、社企业和事业，抽调劳动力充实农业生产。对生产关系不大、暂缺材料的水电站、砖瓦厂、牛奶厂、酒厂、造纸厂等暂时停办；对性质类似可以合并管理的林场、园艺场进行合并，缩减一部分劳动力回生产队生产；对生产迫切需要的农械厂、试验场、畜牧场，尽量利用城镇居民、家属等换回从农村调出的劳动力；文工队、民办学校暂停活动，全部到田间生产。第二，大量压缩副业生产的劳动力，并做到农闲多搞，农忙少搞或不搞。第三，对非农业生产的后勤人员，采取以弱换强的办法，把强将精兵开赴农业生产第一线。此外，县委还对保留下来的县、社企业和专业队伍加强领导，大力改善经营管理，大搞技术革新，以便进一步节约劳动力。
    采取这些措施以后，全县调回生产队的劳动力成倍增长。据统计，县办企业和事业等单位腾出劳动力约七千人，社办企业和大队副业腾出劳动力一万五千多人，大队非农业生产的后勤人员腾出劳动力八千多人，公社下放干部和城镇居民参加农业生产约五千人，全县共腾出劳动力达三万五千多人。目前投入田间生产的劳动力已增至五万二千人，达到农村总劳动力的80％。劳动力高度集中以后，大大鼓舞了农村广大群众的生产积极性，夏收夏种的速度大大加快。
    本报讯　广东南海县采取有力措施调整劳动力，有效地充实了农业生产第一线。现在全县从事田间作业的劳动力已从原来的十一万五千七百人，增加到十三万八千三百多人；即从占农村总劳动力的57％增加到69％。
    南海县各级党组织在集中劳动力的时候，首先做好政治思想工作，在干部和群众中大张旗鼓地宣传“农业是国民经济发展的基础”的思想。
    在整顿劳动力中，南海县还着重抓好以下三个环节：
    第一、有计划地整顿大队劳动组织，加强劳动管理，提高工作效率。各生产大队在整顿劳动力的时候，都采用了“定员、定额、定任务”的办法，对专业队伍加以整顿。这样，不仅在专业队中抽出了大批劳动力，而且使各线的正常生产完全不受影响。三山大队实行这一办法后，还促进了工具改革，提高了工作效率。例如养鸭从每人管理三百只增加到四百只，瓜菜地从每人管理两亩增加到三亩，养猪从原来每人养六十头增加到八十头，管理鱼塘从每人管理六亩增加到八亩。
    第二、大力组织城镇工人家属、小商贩家属、干部家属和超龄学生参加农业生产。只要认真做好思想工作，他们还是愿意参加劳动的。例如，平洲公社夏西大队在几天内便发动了一百二十八个城镇劳动力参加农业生产。他们的做法是，首先召开会议，讲清政策，说明道理，然后发动大家谈思想，提意见，再按各人的劳动条件分别具体安排，各得其所，人尽其才。这样，大家都很满意。
    第三、对县、社工业，除整顿劳动组织，压缩多余劳动力以支援农业生产外，还采取发展直接为农业生产服务的工业，削减、下放、撤销与国计民生关系不大的工业，省出劳力，支援农业。
    此外，还决定包产队干部一律不脱产，其余干部一律要与群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，带头劳动；这样不仅能增加劳动力，而且将大大密切干部和群众的关系。
