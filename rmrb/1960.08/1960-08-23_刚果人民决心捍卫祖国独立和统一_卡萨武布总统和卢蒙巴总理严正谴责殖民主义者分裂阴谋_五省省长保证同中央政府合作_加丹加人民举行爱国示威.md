Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd, Leopoldville dispatch: Congolese President Kasavubu, at a banquet on the 19th for the governors of all provinces (except Katanga) attending a meeting in Leopoldville, condemned the colonialists' conspiracy to divide and attempt to re-dominate the Congo. He called on the Congolese people to fully support the Congolese central government and the provincial governments that recognize the central government's authority.

Lumumba, in his speech, expressed his gratitude to the provincial governors attending the banquet because they had already done much work for the Congo.

The provincial governors guaranteed that they would cooperate closely with the central government and with each other. They condemned all separatist conspiracies.

It is reported that among the six provinces of the Congo, the governors of the five provinces other than Katanga and Prime Minister Lumumba had earlier decided to take measures to deal with the separatist activities of the imperialist lackey, Katanga Province Governor Tshombe, and his accomplices, and decided to reorganize and strengthen the Congolese army.

It is reported that Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba delivered a radio address to the Congolese people on the 21st, calling on them to rise up and defend the country and appealing for unity. He pointed out that the enemy is taking the opportunity to attack the Congolese people. He opposed any conspiracy to divide the Congo in the name of "federation" or "confederation."

Lumumba strongly condemned the Belgian colonialists and their accomplices for attempting to reconquer the Congo. He said that due to the efforts of the Congolese people and the support of all friends, the Belgian imperialists are in a desperate situation and are making a dying struggle.

In his speech, Lumumba recalled the humiliation, distress, restrictions on freedom, martial law, arrests, and abuse suffered by the Congolese people during the eighty years of Belgian colonial rule in the Congo.

Lumumba also denounced the persecution carried out by reactionary Catholics in the Congo.

Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd, Elisabethville dispatch: The people of Katanga Province, Congo, continued their demonstrations in Elisabethville on the 21st against the traitorous acts of the imperialist agent Tshombe in splitting the Congo.

It is reported that 250 demonstrators supporting the Balubakat party gathered at the airport that day to await the expected arrival of Sandwe, the Katanga Minister of State of the Congolese central government. Local police in Elisabethville threw tear gas at them in an attempt to disperse them, but the demonstrators regrouped on their way back to the city, and the police dispatched police cars to arrest about 100 demonstrators.

At the same time, the separatist "government" of Tshombe, fostered by imperialism, arrested Congolese Minister of Justice Mwamba on the 21st at Kamina base while he was flying from Leopoldville to Elisabethville.

It is reported that on the 21st, Tshombe, who is actively plotting to overthrow the central government with the encouragement and support of imperialism, held talks with representatives of some political parties. According to Paul Katanga, one of the representatives who participated in the talks, the purpose of their meeting was "to establish a confederation of states and form a group that will overthrow Lumumba."

Prior to this, on the 20th, Tshombe, at the ceremony celebrating the completion of a new radio station in the suburbs of Elisabethville, clamored that his Congolese federal plan would defeat Prime Minister Lumumba's unity plan. It is reported that this newly built radio station will be used to carry out propaganda to split the Congo to other regions of the Congo.

    新华社22日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总统卡萨武布在19日宴请到利奥波德维尔开会的各省（除加丹加省以外）省长时，谴责殖民主义者分裂和企图重新统治刚果的阴谋。他号召刚果人民全力支持刚果中央政府和支持承认中央政府权力的各省政府。
    卢蒙巴在讲话时表示感谢出席宴会的各省省长，因为他们已经为刚果做了许多工作。
    各省省长保证说，他们将同中央政府密切合作，并且将彼此密切合作。他们谴责了一切分裂主义的阴谋。
    据报道，在刚果六个省中，除加丹加省之外，其它五个省的省长和卢蒙巴总理在早些时候已经决定采取措施来对付帝国主义的走狗、加丹加省省长冲伯和他的帮凶所进行的分裂活动，并决定改组和加强刚果军队。
    据报道，刚果总理卢蒙巴21日向刚果人民发表广播演说，号召刚果人民起来保卫国家，并呼吁统一。他指出，敌人正在乘机打击刚果人民。他反对任何以“联邦”和“邦联”的名义来进行分裂刚果的阴谋。
    卢蒙巴强烈谴责比利时殖民者和他们的同谋者企图重新征服刚果。他说，由于刚果人民的努力和一切朋友的支持，比利时帝国主义者处于绝望的境地，他们正在作垂死的挣扎。
    卢蒙巴在演说中回顾了在比利时殖民主义者统治刚果的八十年中刚果人民遭到的屈辱、困恼、限制自由的戒严、逮捕和虐待等。
    卢蒙巴在讲话中还指责反动的天主教会在刚果进行的迫害活动。
    新华社22日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：刚果加丹加省人民21日又在伊利沙伯维尔继续示威，反对帝国主义代理人冲伯分裂刚果的卖国行为。
    据报道，支持巴卢巴卡特党的二百五十名示威者这天曾聚集在机场等候预料可能到达的刚果中央政府的加丹加国务部长桑德韦。伊利沙伯维尔地方的警察向他们投掷催泪弹，企图加以驱散，可是示威者在回城的途中又集合起来，警察于是出动警车逮捕了约一百名示威者。
    与此同时，由帝国主义扶植的冲伯的分裂“政府”，21日在加米纳基地逮捕了从利奥波德维尔飞往伊利沙伯维尔途中的刚果司法部长姆旺巴。
    据报道，21日，在帝国主义怂恿和支持下正在积极策划阴谋推翻中央政府的冲伯，曾同一些政党代表举行了会谈。据参予这次会谈的代表之一保罗·卡丹加透露，他们会谈的目的“是要成立一个国家的邦联，组成一个将推翻卢蒙巴的集团”。
    在这之前，冲伯20日在庆祝伊利沙伯维尔郊外新建的广播电台落成典礼上叫嚣说，他的刚果联邦计划将战胜卢蒙巴总理的统一计划。据报道，这个新建成的广播电台将被用来向刚果其他地区进行分裂刚果的宣传。
