Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch: Under the correct leadership of the Party, China's young photographic art is striding forward along the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Currently, it has developed into a new stage of great popularization, great improvement, and great prosperity.

Since the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," China's photographic art has consistently developed in the correct direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Photographic art has been closely integrated with the central work of each period, directly serving the political struggles and production construction led by the Party. According to rough statistics, during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation alone, Chinese photographers took more than 100,000 photographs related to the revolutionary war. It widely and profoundly reflected the face of the times and the great aspirations of the people, demonstrated the great struggle and heroic achievements of the working masses, and possessed strong, clear revolutionary and militant characteristics. Since the Great Leap Forward, China's photographic art has marched forward along the road of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the socialist cause, and implemented the policy of letting a hundred flowers blossom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new. Therefore, it has been greatly enriched and diversified in terms of the subject matter of photographic works, or in the creative themes, styles, forms, and genres. These photographic works, from various aspects and in various forms, praised the three red banners of China's socialist construction's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, reflecting our great era. Works such as "Chairman Mao and Guests from Asia, Africa, and Latin America," "The Harder It Rains, the Greater the Enthusiasm," "Divert the Tao River to the Mountains," "Mobilization," and "Strike at the U.S. Aggressors" have been well received not only in China but also internationally. In the past two years, China has won five first prizes and gold medals, and nineteen other awards at international photographic art exhibitions.

The publication of the "China" album is one of the best examples showing the great leap forward in the quality of China's photographic art creation. This is a large-scale album mainly composed of photographic works published on the eve of the 1959 National Day, which brings together 464 excellent works by Chinese photographers. This album truthfully, vividly, and dynamically reflects the heroic spirit of the Chinese people, who are full of spirit and high morale over the past decade. Poets and writers have written poems and articles praising this album, calling it "a liberation epic composed of photographs."

Due to the active development of training for full-time and amateur photographers, a large number of new photographic forces have grown up, expanding the photographic team. A photographic team with proletarian photographers as the backbone is growing rapidly, and photographic organizations are rapidly increasing. Chinese photographers, because they often go to factories and rural areas, go deep into the working masses, and participate in physical labor and actual struggle, have undergone great changes in their ideological outlook.

China's photographic art has become a mass undertaking of the working people. Since the Great Leap Forward, mass photography activities in China have become greatly active. Among the national railway workers alone, there are now more than 2,000 organized photography activists. Photographic works created by photography enthusiasts are increasingly being adopted by various exhibitions, newspapers and magazines, and are deeply welcomed by the masses.

    沿着文艺为工农兵服务的方向阔步前进
    我国摄影艺术百花齐放
    据新华社2日讯　年轻的我国摄影艺术事业在党的正确领导下，正沿着文艺为工农兵服务的方向阔步前进。目前，它已发展到一个大普及、大提高、大繁荣的新阶段。
    我国人民的摄影艺术，从毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表以来，就一直沿着文艺为工农兵服务的正确方向发展。摄影艺术紧密地结合着每个时期的中心工作，直接为党所领导的政治斗争和生产建设服务。据粗略的统计，仅在抗日战争和解放战争时期，我国摄影工作者所拍摄的有关革命战争的照片就在十万张以上。它广泛地、深刻地反映了时代的面貌和人民的伟大志向，表现了劳动群众的伟大斗争和英雄业迹，具有强烈的鲜明的革命性和战斗性。大跃进以来，我国的摄影艺术，沿着文艺为工农兵、为社会主义事业服务的道路阔步前和贯彻执行百花齐放、进百家争鸣、推陈出新的方针，因而不论在摄影作品的题材上，或者在创作的题材、风格、形式、体裁等各方面，都大大地丰富多样了。这些摄影作品，从各个方面，以各种不同的形式，歌颂了我国的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，反映了我们这个伟大的时代。如“毛主席和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的贵宾在一起”、“雨越大干劲越足”、“要把洮河引上山”、“鼓动”、“打击美国侵略者”等作品，不仅在我国，而且在国际上也得到好评。最近两年来，我国在国际摄影艺术展览会上获得第一奖和金质奖五个，其他奖十九个。
    最能表现我国摄影艺术创作质量大跃进的一个例子是“中国”画册的出版。这是1959年国庆节前夕出版的以摄影作品为主的巨型画册，其中汇集了我国摄影家的优秀作品四百六十四幅。这本画册真实、鲜明、生动地反映了十年来我国人民意气风发、斗志昂扬的英雄气概。诗人和作家写出了赞扬这本画册的诗篇和文章，称它是“用照片组成的一部解放史诗”。
    由于积极开展了专职和业余的摄影人员培养和训练工作，大批的新生摄影力量成长起来，扩大了摄影队伍。一支以无产阶级摄影工作者为骨干的摄影队伍正在迅速成长，摄影组织迅速增加。我国摄影工作者，由于经常下厂下乡，深入工农群众，并参加体力劳动和实际斗争，因此思想面貌起了很大变化。
    我国的摄影艺术已经成为劳动人民群众性的事业。大跃进以来，我国群众摄影活动大为活跃，仅全国铁路职工中，目前已经组织起来的摄影积极分子就有两千多人。摄影爱好者创作的摄影作品，越来越多地被各种展览会、报刊杂志采用，深受群众欢迎。
