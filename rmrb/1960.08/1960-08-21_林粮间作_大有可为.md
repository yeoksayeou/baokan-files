    Agroforestry Intercropping: Great Potential
    Wang Li, Zhang Xiuqun
    Agroforestry intercropping is an important direction for fully utilizing land in mountainous areas, and also an important measure for increasing grain production in mountainous areas. The people of the Hanzhong Special Zone in Shaanxi Province have traditionally practiced agroforestry intercropping. Since liberation, the area of agroforestry intercropping here has been expanding year by year. Especially after the Party Central Committee put forward the production policy of "taking grain as the key link and developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries simultaneously," agroforestry intercropping in mountainous areas has been pushed to a new stage. According to statistics from the Hanzhong Special Administrative Office's Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, as of now, the area of agroforestry intercropping in the entire special zone has reached more than 1.36 million mu, accounting for approximately 30% of the total area of economic forests.
      Several Types of Agroforestry Intercropping
    In the Hanzhong Special Zone, agroforestry intercropping has the following six types:
    1. In deep mountainous old forest areas, flat or gently sloping land within them is cultivated in a planned manner. The shape is determined according to the terrain, some are strip-shaped, or called "wearing boots and hats," that is, the trees on the top and foot of the mountain are not moved, only the flat or gently sloping land in the waist is cultivated; some are in the form of "plum blossom dots," that is, the surroundings are all forests, only some flat or gently sloping land in the middle is cultivated. Many of these strip-shaped or fragmented flatlands were planted by local people a long time ago, but were abandoned due to disasters such as wars and epidemics, forcing people to move away. When cultivating these lands, the small pieces of mature forests among them were still retained, forming a situation of growing grain in large forests, and cultivating small forests in grain fields. This kind of agroforestry intercropping land can generally gradually form terraces; those with water sources gradually become paddy fields; some of the poorer quality slopes may also be abandoned from agriculture and returned to forestry (economic forests) after a period of planting, when the soil becomes barren.
    2. Taking advantage of the opportunity to renew tree fungus, plant crops for one or two years whenever possible. This practice exists in Yangping, Chengguan, and Guangping Communes in Ningqiang, and Liuba Commune in Fengxian County. Because the oak trees that produce tree fungus generally need to grow for seven or eight years before they can be felled and harvested for tree fungus, people take advantage of the time when the regenerated seedlings are still small after the main trunks are felled, and cultivate the gaps in the forest (without damaging the roots) to plant crops using the rich humus of the forest land. After the saplings grow up, they are completely closed to cultivation again. Of the more than 600,000 mu of tree fungus forests in the entire special zone, more than 130,000 mu are currently used for intercropping crops. In addition, in some places, when cultivating mountain land for planting medicinal materials such as codonopsis and rhubarb, one or two years of buckwheat and rapeseed are planted while the medicinal seedlings are still small (codonopsis generally takes five years to harvest) to increase income.
    3. On steep slopes prepared for abandonment, trees (or direct seeding) are planted for afforestation (generally mostly economic forests), while using the gaps between the seedlings to plant crops for two or three years, and then completely abandoning cultivation after the seedlings grow up. In this way, the seedlings can also benefit from the soil loosening, weeding, and fertilization in crop cultivation. When the trees grow up and it is no longer possible to plant crops in the forest land, the trees already have greater benefits, which combines the immediate interests of the masses with long-term interests.
    4. In shallow mountainous and hilly areas, barren mountains and wastelands are reclaimed. At the beginning, forests are created and trees are planted on steep slopes and mountain tops, and grain and medicinal materials are planted on gentle slopes and flat areas, and paddy fields are gradually built in places with water sources, and terraces are built in places without water sources. This makes agriculture and forestry promote each other, and also takes into account the immediate and long-term interests of the masses. According to estimates by relevant departments, of the 2.36 million mu of barren mountains and hills in the district, in addition to the currently utilized part, there are still 230,000 mu that can be utilized.
    5. In some economic forests, crops are planted in the gaps between trees. For example, Chenggu Juyuan Commune plants wheat in the young forest in summer and sweet potatoes in autumn; in the mature forest, bean crops are planted in both summer and autumn. In many other places, walnuts, tung trees, and persimmon forests are also intercropped according to the principle of being conducive to the growth of the orchard and making crops able to obtain significant harvests. A commune in Guangwu Township, Hanzhong City, used orchard intercropping to plant 3,000 mu of crops. Of the 1.39 million mu of economic forests in the district, about 220,000 mu have been planted and can be planted with crops.
    6. Along riverbanks and beaches in water-facing and windy areas, protective forest belts are built to prevent floods and winds and protect farmland. In addition, various places also universally use field ridges, land embankments, canal banks, and the surrounding open space of ponds and reservoirs to build various forest belts; some also plant Corylopsis and other medicinal materials in the area. In short, gradually form a green net in the farmland to firmly tie up the farmland.
        Many Benefits of Agroforestry Intercropping
    It can now be seen that there are many benefits to implementing agroforestry intercropping in mountainous areas. The most prominent of these are the following: First, it solves the long-standing contradiction between agriculture and forestry competing for land and labor, and opens up broad prospects for basic agricultural and forestry construction in mountainous areas. Second, forestry and agriculture are mutually complementary. First of all, trees provide ample fertilizer for crops: green and tender branches and leaves are used for composting, old leaves and residual branches are burned for fertilizer, and there are also bird droppings and forest humus. Secondly, forests conserve rainwater, directly providing water sources, and can regulate rainfall and climate, which is conducive to the growth of crops. In 1959, the Meiman Production Team of Sujiaba, Chengguan Commune, Ningqiang County, used the opportunity to renew 170 mu of tree fungus to plant corn intercropped with soybeans in the forest land. Due to the fertility of the forest land – a lot of humus – the average yield per mu reached more than 110 jin, 21 jin higher than ordinary mountain land, and a total of more than 20,000 jin of grain was harvested. In recent years, Xixiang Shankou Commune has created 55,300 mu of economic forests and adopted agroforestry intercropping. In 1959, under the special drought in the past 30 years, the grain harvest was 805,000 jin more than in 1958, an increase of 15%; the harvest of walnuts, tung seeds, and other oil crops was 269,900 jin, also a large increase compared with the previous year. Third, in agroforestry intercropping, grain is planted in the forest, and there are forests around the farmland, so soil and water are not easily lost; because the grain planting is all selected on flat or gently sloping land, it is even more beneficial to build terraces to conserve soil and water, forming the so-called "golden bucket" (flat dry land) and "silver簸箕" (paddy fields). Also, because the forest intercepts water section by section, conserves water sources, and regulates climate and rainfall, it increases long-flowing water, providing favorable conditions for water conservancy construction. There are large areas of flat or gently sloping land in the middle of the forest. If cultivation is limited by labor and cannot be used for growing crops, pasture can also be cultivated, creating conditions for the development of animal husbandry.
      Visionary Planning, Specific Planning
    From the experience of the Hanzhong Special Zone, to carry out agroforestry intercropping, it is necessary to conduct specific planning under the unified leadership of the county and commune party committees, based on the principles of visionary foresight and active gradual implementation. This planning can first hand over the guiding principles and general ideas to grassroots organizations and the masses for discussion, put forward specific plans from the bottom up, and report them level by level for review and modification. Then, the revised plan is handed over to the masses for discussion, so that it takes root among the masses, and finally the higher-level leading organs make a decision, and implement it. This can prevent some people from only focusing on the present, using the excuse of intercropping, resulting in indiscriminate felling and reclamation. Labor must be properly arranged and labor remuneration must be reasonably resolved. The practice in the Hanzhong Special Zone is to adjust the labor of agricultural and forestry professional teams (groups) according to the farming area and crop season. During the busy farming season, there is more agriculture than forestry, and even all efforts are put into agriculture; during the slack farming season, the labor for forestry is appropriately increased. Labor remuneration is uniformly distributed by the basic accounting unit according to agriculture and forestry. It is conceivable that in promoting agroforestry intercropping in mountainous areas, many new contradictions will arise; however, as long as we adhere to this direction, under the leadership of the Party, and give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, all contradictions can be gradually resolved.

    林粮间作　大有可为
    王礼　张秀群
    林粮间作，是山区充分利用土地的一个重要方向，也是山区增产粮食的一项重要措施。陕西汉中专区的群众，历来就有林粮间作的习惯。解放后，这里的林粮间作面积在逐年扩大，特别是党中央提出了“以粮为纲，农、林、牧、副、渔五业并举”的生产方针后，把山区的林粮间作推上了一个新的阶段。据汉中专署农林局统计，截至目前，全专区林粮间作的面积已达一百三十六万余亩，大约占到经济林总面积的30％。
      林粮间作的几种类型
    汉中专区林粮间作，有以下六种类型：
    一、在深山老林区，有计划地垦植其中的平坦地或缓坡地。其形状根据地形而定，有的是带状，或叫“穿靴带帽”，即山顶、山跟的林木不动，只垦种腰部的平坦地或缓坡地；有的是“梅花点”式的，即四周皆林，只垦种中间的若干平坦地或缓坡地。这些带状或零块的平坦地，许多是很久以前由当地群众种植，后因兵荒、疫病等灾害，人们被迫迁走而荒芜的。人们在垦种这些土地时，对其中小片的成材林仍然保留了下来，形成大林中种粮，粮地中又栽培小林的局面。这种林粮间作的土地一般可以逐渐形成梯地；有水源的就逐渐变成了水田；有一部分质量较差的坡地，也可能在种植一个时期，当土质变得瘠薄以后，又弃农还林（经济林）。
    二、利用木耳更新的机会，见缝插针，抓一、两年庄稼。在宁强的阳平、城关、广坪公社，凤县的留坝公社等，都有这种做法。因为生产木耳的青杠树，一般要经过七、八年的生长，才能砍伐后收木耳子，人们就在主干砍伐以后，复生的幼苗尚小的时机，开垦树林的间隙（不伤树根），利用林地丰富腐植质种庄稼。树苗长大以后，又完全封耕。全专区现有的六十多万亩木耳林，目前利用来间种庄稼的有十三万多亩。另外，还有一些地方，在开垦种党参、大黄等药材的山地中，利用药苗尚小的时机（党参一般要长五年才能采用），种一、两年荞麦、油菜，来增加收入。
    三、在准备弃耕的陡坡地，一面植树（或直播）造林（一般多为经济林），一面利用树苗的间隙种两三年庄稼，等树苗长大后，完全弃耕。这样树苗通过作务庄稼中的松土、锄草、施肥，也可得“借水浇花”之益。当树木长大再不能在林地种庄稼时，林木则已有较大收益，这就把群众的眼前利益和长远利益结合了起来。
    四、浅山丘陵地区开垦荒山荒地，一开始就在陡坡和山顶造林植树，在缓坡和平坦地方种粮种药，并且逐渐在有水源的地方修水田，没水源的地方修梯地。这样使农林互相促进，也使群众的眼前利益和长远利益得到兼顾。据有关部门估计，全区二百三十六万亩荒山丘陵中，除目前已利用部分外，尚有二十三万亩可以利用。
    五、在一些经济林中，利用树与树的间隙种庄稼。例如城固桔园公社，在幼林内夏季种小麦，秋季种红薯；在成林内夏秋两季都种豆类作物。其他许多地方，在核桃林、桐子林、柿子林内，也都根据有利园林的成长、并可使庄稼能得到显著收获的原则进行套种。汉中市光武乡一个公社，就利用园林套种了三千亩庄稼。全区一百三十九万亩经济林中，已种和可种庄稼的约有二十二万余亩。
    六、在河岸、河滩靠水、迎风地区，营造防护林带，防洪防风，保护庄田。此外，各地还普遍利用田坎、地堎、渠岸、塘库周围空地，营造各种林带；也有在地区种植莫萸等药材的。总之使其逐步在农田中组成一个绿色网，牢牢把农田网结起来。
        林粮间作好处多
    现在已经可以看到，在山区实行林粮间作的好处很多。其中最突出的有以下几点：第一，解决了长期以来存在的农林争土地争劳力的矛盾，为山区农林基本建设开辟了广阔前途。第二，林农相辅相成。首先，树木为农作物提供了充分的肥料：青嫩枝叶沤肥，老叶余枝烧肥、熏肥，此外还有鸟粪及林间腐植质等。其次，森林含蓄雨水，直接提供了水源，并能调节雨量、气候，有利于农作物的生长。宁强城关公社苏家坝美满生产队，1959年利用一百七十亩木耳更新机会，在林地种植玉米套黄豆，由于林地土肥——腐植质多，平均亩产达到一百一十多斤，高出一般山地二十一斤，共收到二万多斤粮食。西乡?口公社，几年来营造经济林五万五千三百多亩，采取林粮间作，1959年在三十年来特有的大旱情况下，粮食比1958年多收了八十万五千多斤，增产15％；核桃、桐子等油料收获二十六万九千九百多斤，比上年增产也很多。第三，林粮间作，林中种粮、农田周围有林，水土不易流失；由于种粮都是选择的平坦地或缓坡地，更有利用修筑梯田梯地，保持水土，形成所谓“金斗”（平旱地）“银簸箕”（水田）。又由于森林节节拦水，含蓄水源，调节气候雨量，增加了长流水，为水利建设提供了有利条件。森林中间有大片平坦地或缓坡地，如果开垦因劳力限制，不能种庄稼，还可以培植牧草，为发展畜牧业创造条件。
      高瞻远瞩　具体规划
    从汉中专区的经验看，搞林粮间作，必须在县、社党委统一领导下，本着高瞻远瞩和积极逐步实现的原则，进行具体的规划。这种规划，可以先把方针原则和大体设想交给基层组织和群众讨论，自下而上地提出具体规划，逐级上报，审查修改。然后再把修改后的规划，交由群众讨论，使它在群众中扎根，最后由上级领导机关定案，贯彻执行。这样可以防止一些人只顾眼前，借口搞间作，产生滥伐乱垦的现象。要妥善地安排劳力，合理地解决劳动报酬。汉中专区的作法是：按耕作区和庄稼季节调整农、林专业队（组）的劳力，农忙时农多于林，甚至全力搞农业；农闲时适当增加林用劳力。劳动报酬由基本核算单位按农林统一分配。可以设想，在推行山区林粮间作中，还会出现许多新的矛盾；但是，只要我们坚持这个方向，在党的领导下，充分发挥人民公社优越性，所有的矛盾都是可以逐步解决的。
