Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 8th (Reporters Miao Yu and Tie Feng) - From noon on the 6th to the evening of the 7th, more than fifty trains loaded with coal and other materials successively headed for Anshan. The section of the railway line north of the Taizi River stretched out smoothly. If it weren't for the traces of flooding on both sides of the railway, it would be hard to imagine that this section of the line had been destroyed by floods for several kilometers just two days earlier.

Since the beginning of August, heavy rains have fallen continuously in eastern Liaoning Province, and the floods have risen sharply. A section of the Shenyang-Dalian line, about five kilometers between the Jieganting Bridge and the Taizi River Bridge, was quickly submerged by floods, turning into a vast expanse of water. The floodwaters overflowed the railway line, overturning the rails and sleepers together. In order to ensure the production of the steel capital Anshan, railway workers and the military and civilians along the line quickly launched a heroic repair effort after the railway was washed away. Guo Lu, Vice Minister of Railways, Li Can, Deputy Director of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, and other leading comrades personally went to the front line to lead the rescue efforts. Several hundred railway workers first bravely protected the Jieganting Bridge and the Taizi River Bridge. At this time, the repair plan was determined, and a large number of ready-to-go employees from the Railway Bureau rushed to the construction site, and truckloads of emergency repair materials were also transported to the site. As the water receded, a tense battle of repair began.

In order to concentrate forces and speed up the progress of the repair project, the workers first focused on repairing the less damaged upstream line, advancing simultaneously from both ends. Fully aware of the importance of the task they were carrying out, the railway workers and the military and civilians along the line were all full of energy and enthusiasm. The famous youth shock brigade—the first team of the second squad of the third engineering section—accepted the important task of filling the flood diversion opening near the Jieganting Bridge. They unfolded the competition with an indomitable spirit, and the number of baskets of earth carried by each person continued to increase. They quickly filled the opening, laid the steel rails, and allowed the material trucks behind to move forward quickly.

On the night of the 5th, the most tense and moving scene appeared. It was raining heavily, and the spotlights cast white light through the raindrops. On the repair line, which was more than one kilometer long, the labor shouts of carrying steel rails and sleepers, the sound of dumping earth, and the sounds of challenge and response coming from the loudspeakers intertwined with the sound of rain. Each team told the propagandist about their challenge and response conditions, and asked the propagandist to broadcast them on the loudspeaker. The competition reached a fever pitch. Especially late at night, when a letter of commendation from the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China was broadcast, people immediately boiled over. Each team fought more and more enthusiastically. Their deeds were not reported to the propagandist in time, so they sent representatives to the front of the loudspeaker to report themselves. Many leading cadres also labored with everyone, and took off their raincoats and draped them over the new workers. The veteran workers Ma Guangde and Wang Yushu, regardless of the heavy rain and the muddy ground, carried the sleepers salvaged from the water. While others carried one sleeper between two people, they carried one on their own shoulders, and worked until the task was completed. At about midnight, the workers connected the tracks of the upstream line. Soon, a test run car safely passed through this line that had been interrupted for more than a day.

At noon on the 6th, a certain unit of the Railway Corps that came to support the repair also arrived. They were technically skilled and very motivated. They were assigned 250 meters of repair work, and completed 500 meters in one go, greatly speeding up the progress. By the morning of the 7th, the upstream and downstream lines of this section were completely repaired and opened to traffic, after only one day and two nights.

When trains loaded with coal drove towards the steel capital in front of them, everyone forgot their fatigue and showed victorious smiles.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 8th - A large number of officers and soldiers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Liaoning area have rushed to the front lines of flood control in the eastern part of Liaoning Province. General Chen Xilian and Lieutenant General Zeng Siyu, heads of the troops stationed in the Shenyang area, personally took charge and directed the officers and soldiers to participate in the flood control and rescue struggle.

The troops stationed in the Shenyang area held an emergency telephone conference on the 4th and assigned the task of participating in flood prevention to their subordinate units.

General Chen Xilian called on all troops to mobilize urgently, carry forward the glorious tradition of the people's soldiers, go to the front line of flood control and rescue, and overcome the floods together with the people. All troops immediately formed flood prevention headquarters, and a large number of officers and soldiers rushed to areas where danger occurred overnight, and together with the masses, reinforced dikes and rescued state and people's property. Air Force units continuously dispatched aircraft to scout out dangerous situations and report the situation. The troops also allocated more than 500 rubber boats, more than 100 trucks, as well as speedboats, rowing machines, amphibious vehicles and other equipment for rescue use.

All units and subordinate organs and schools in Liaoning dispatched a large number of personnel. On the 23-kilometer-long Hun River dike, officers and soldiers of the troops, together with the masses, undertook the task of reinforcing and raising the embankment. More than 150 officers and soldiers of a certain unit, led by Wang Rixuan, deputy director of the political department, and together with cadres and members of the commune, built a 3-meter-wide, 2-meter-high, and 800-meter-long embankment in one day despite the heavy rain.

    太子河边铁路沿线军民胜利保证鞍山物资运输
    英勇修复沈大线中断路段
    驻辽宁地区官兵发扬光荣传统奔赴抗洪最前线
    新华社沈阳8日电　新华社记者缪雨、铁风报道：从6日中午到7日晚上，五十多列满载煤炭等物资的火车陆续开往鞍山。太子河北边的一段铁路线，平整地伸展着。要不是铁路两侧留有洪水的痕迹，人们很难想到，两天前这段线路曾被洪水冲毁过好几公里。
    8月份以来，辽东地区连降暴雨，洪水猛涨，沈（阳）大（连）线接官亭桥到太子河桥之间的一段约五公里的铁路，很快就被洪水淹没，变成一片汪洋。洪水漫过铁路线，把路轨连枕木一起都冲得翻了个身。为了保证钢都鞍山的生产，铁路职工和沿线军民在铁路被冲以后迅速展开了英勇抢修。铁道部副部长郭鲁、沈阳铁路局副局长李参等领导同志，都亲临前线领导抢险。几百名铁路职工首先奋勇地保住了接官亭桥和太子河大桥，这时候，抢修方案确定了，大批整装待命的路局职工赶到了，一车车抢险材料也运到了工地。随着水势的下落，一场紧张的抢修战斗开始了。
    为了集中力量加快修复工程进度，职工们首先突击修复受害较轻的上行线，由两头同时并进。充分认识到自己所执行任务的重大意义的铁路职工和沿线军民们，个个生龙活虎，干劲冲天。著名的青年突击队——第三工程段第二中队第一小队的职工，接受了填平接官亭桥边分洪口子的重要任务。他们以愈战愈勇的气概展开竞赛，每个人挑土的筐数不断增加。很快就把口子填平，铺上钢轨，让后面的材料车迅速前进。
    5日夜晚，出现了最紧张最动人的场面。天下着大雨，聚光灯在雨点中射出白色的光芒，在一公里多长的抢修线上，扛运钢轨和枕木的劳动呼声、倒土声和广播喇叭里传出来的挑战应战声同雨声交响在一起。各小队都把自己的挑战应战条件告诉宣传员，请宣传员在播音器里广播。竞赛热潮一浪高过一浪，特别是在深夜，传来了中共辽宁省委的表扬信，人们立刻沸腾起来。各小队愈战愈酣，他们的事迹来不及告诉宣传员，就自己派代表跑到播音器跟前去报告。许多领导干部也都和大家一起劳动，并且脱下自己的雨衣，披在新工人的身上。老工人马广德、王玉书两人不顾大雨和地下泥泞，搬运从水中捞出来的枕木，别人两人抬一根，他们一人扛一根，一直干到完成任务。午夜十二时许，职工们就把上行线的路轨接通了。不久，一辆试运行的车子就安全通过了这条中断了一天多的线路。
    6日中午，前来支援抢修的铁道兵某部也赶到了。他们技术熟练，干劲很大，分配了二百五十米抢修任务，一口气就完成了五百米，使进度大大加快。到7日清晨，这一路段上行下行全部修复通车，先后不过一昼两夜。
    当一列列运煤的火车从人们的跟前向钢都驶去的时候，大家都忘记了自己的疲劳，露出胜利的微笑。
    新华社沈阳8日电　中国人民解放军驻辽宁地区部队大批官兵，奔赴辽宁省东部地区抗洪最前线。驻沈阳地区部队负责人陈锡联上将、曾思玉中将，亲自上阵，指挥官兵投入抗洪抢险斗争。
    驻沈阳地区部队于4日召开紧急电话会议，向所属部队布置了参加防汛的工作。
    陈锡联上将号召各部队紧急动员起来，发扬人民子弟兵的光荣传统，开赴抗洪抢险前线，与人民一道战胜洪水。各部队马上组成了防汛指挥部，大批官兵连夜开赴发生险情地区，和广大群众一起，加固堤防，抢救国家和人民财产。空军部队连续出动飞机侦察险情，报告情况。部队还调拨了五百多只橡皮船、一百多辆卡车以及汽艇、操舟机、水陆汽车等器材，供抢险使用。
    辽宁各部队及所属机关、学校，都出动了大批人员。在二十三公里长的浑河大堤上，部队官兵与人民群众一起担负了加固加高工程。某部队一百五十多名官兵，在政治部副主任王日轩率领下，与公社的干部和社员一起冒着大雨筑堤，一天就筑起一道三米宽、两米高、八百多米长的堤坝。
