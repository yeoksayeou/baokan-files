O lark, soaring high, fly beyond the clouds, beyond the Friendship Pass. That is the hometown of my friends – beautiful and rich Vietnam. How many unforgettable moments have we spent strolling in the spacious Ba Dinh Square, gazing up at the golden-starred red flag atop the Presidential Palace.

	Friends, radiant and singing with enthusiasm. The history of Vietnam's liberation began here,
	Extending towards a bright future. How many dawns and dusks have we lingered on the picturesque shores of Hoan Kiem Lake. Friends plucking at the petals of phoenix flowers,
	Talking about their country's intoxicating scenery. From That Khe to Ca Mau, from north to south,
	All so enchanting. How many times, facing the sunrise and sunset, have we driven together along the banks of the Red River. Friends pointing to the emerging water conservancy projects,
	Their eyes gleaming with light. In the days to come, the Mekong Delta
	Will also become like this. There were also one or two times when we walked to the quiet Bianhai River. Friends gazing deeply at the South,
	Where their own flesh and blood and birth parents reside. Sharing the same sun overhead, living on the same land, the north bank of the River is filled with songs of peaceful construction, but the south bank has become a slaughterhouse! A crocodile is always a crocodile, a wolf is still a wolf. The French colonialists were just driven away, and now American imperialism has come to霸占 (seize and occupy) South Vietnam! Although it uses guns and cannons to support its running dog Ngo Dinh Diem, it cannot conquer the hearts of the Southern people. Twelve million people are twelve million volcanoes, one day burying imperialism along with its running dogs. O lark, soaring high, fly beyond the clouds, beyond the Friendship Pass. To greet the Vietnamese brothers and sisters who share our fate,
	We will forever encourage and support each other. Taiwan must be liberated!
	Vietnam must be unified!

    遥寄越南
    展潮云雀啊，你高高地飞翔，飞到白云尽头睦南关外。那是我朋友们的家乡——美丽富饶的越南。曾经有多少次难忘的时辰，我们漫步在宽阔的巴亭广场上。仰望着主席府里那面金星红旗
    朋友们容光焕发热情歌唱。越南解放的历史就在这儿开始
    展向灿烂的远方。曾经有多少个黎明和黄昏，我们留连在如画的还剑湖畔。朋友们拨弄着凤凰树的花瓣
    谈起了祖国醉人的风光。从那岑到加茅、从北方到南方
    都是那么令人神往。曾经有多少回迎着朝霞和夕阳，我们一同驱车奔驰在红河两岸。朋友们指点着新兴的水利工程，
    眼睛里闪耀着光芒。来日啊，湄公河三角洲
    也将要变成这样。也曾经有过一两趟，我们走到静静的边海河旁。朋友们深情地注视着南方，
    那儿有自己的骨肉同胞和亲生爹娘。同是头顶着一个太阳，同是生活在一片国土上河北洋溢着和平建设的歌声，南岸却变成了屠场！鳄鱼总是鳄鱼、狼还是狼，法国殖民者刚被赶走，美帝国主义又来霸占越南南方！尽管它用枪炮支撑着走狗吴庭艳，却征服不了南方人民的心。一千二百万个人是一千二百万座火山，总有一天要把帝国主义连同它的走狗一齐埋葬。云雀啊，你高高地飞翔，飞到白云尽头、睦南关外。去向和我们同命运的越南兄弟姐妹们致意，
    我们将永远互相激励，互相支持。台湾一定要解放！
    越南一定要统一！
