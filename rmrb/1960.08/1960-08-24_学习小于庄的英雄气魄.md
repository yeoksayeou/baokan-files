    Learning the Heroic Spirit of Xiaoyuzhuang
    The *People's Daily* published an article by Comrade Ma Li, Secretary of the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee, on July 13, titled "Long Live the 'Poor Bastard' Spirit." This article is a summary of the experience of organizing poor teams to catch up with rich teams and a microcosm of the revolutionary spirit of our heroic people. Last year, Xiaoyuzhuang, the poorest team in the Dazhongzhuang Commune, showed great ambition and high aspirations. They learned the "Poor Bastard" spirit of the Wang Guofan Cooperative and worked hard for a year, transforming their appearance. Xiaoyuzhuang, once called "Beggar Camp" by landlords, was transformed into a Happy Village, and the production and living standards of the entire team surpassed those of the richest team in the commune.
    Where I work is a poor team in the Dahu Commune, a mountainous area of Minhou County, Fujian Province, on the southeastern coastal front of the motherland. We organized cadres, activists, and commune members to conduct study sessions on the Xiaoyuzhuang experience. The commune members said, "Xiaoyuzhuang only had three donkeys, and our sixty households have eleven large cattle. Our conditions are better than Xiaoyuzhuang's, so we can work as hard as Xiaoyuzhuang to catch up with the rich teams in one year." Some said, "Although we are separated by ten thousand miles, the spirit of Xiaoyuzhuang shines in our hearts!" "Xiaoyuzhuang's transformation from poor to rich is the result of the determination to fly to the sky." We are determined to become rich just like Xiaoyuzhuang. Through learning, the commune members were educated, and so were the cadres. The article inspires us comrades working in poor teams to cultivate thousands upon thousands of heroic figures like the "Iron Girls" of Xiaoyuzhuang, who have ideals and drive, to cultivate the revolutionary determination and perseverance to "gnaw away bit by bit to reclaim the wasteland," to create all the material wealth we need, and to catch up with the rich teams.
    Let more "Iron Girls" emerge here, and let us learn the spirit of continuous revolution of the Xiaoyuzhuang comrades and move forward!

    学习小于庄的英雄气魄
    7月13日《人民日报》登了唐山市委书记马力同志《‘穷棒子’精神万岁》的文章，是一篇组织穷队赶富队工作的经验，是我国英雄人民革命精神的一个缩影。去年，小于庄这个大中庄公社最穷的队全队社员树雄心，立大志，学习王国藩社的“穷棒子”精神，苦干一年，改变了面貌。从前被地主称为“化子营”的小于庄，一变而成为幸福庄，全队的生产生活水平超过了全社最富的队。
    我工作的地方是祖国东南沿海前线福建的闽侯县山区大湖公社的一个穷队。我们组织了干部积极分子社员开展了学小于庄经验的学习会。社员们说：“小于庄只有三头毛驴，我们六十户有十一头大牛，我们比小于庄条件好，我们更可以像小于庄那样地苦战一年赶上富队。”有的说：“路隔万里天南北，小于庄精神亮心弦！”“小于庄由穷变富是决心飞上天的结果”。我们有决心和小于庄一个样能穷变富。通过学习，教育了社员，也教育了干部。文章里启示我们在穷队工作的同志也要去培养千千万万像小于庄那样有理想有干劲的“铁姑娘”式的英雄人物，培养“一口口地啃也要把荒地开出来”的革命决心毅力，创造一切我们需要的物质财富，赶上富队。
    让我们这里产生更多的“铁姑娘”，学习小于庄同志的不断革命精神向前迈进！
