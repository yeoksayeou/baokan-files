Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: Over nine hundred young people from all circles in the capital held a gathering tonight to warmly welcome the Japanese General Council of Trade Unions Youth and Women Delegation, led by head of the delegation, Shige Kusonohashi, and deputy head, Ayako Yamamoto, who have come to visit our country.

Yang Jingren, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, spoke at the meeting, warmly welcoming the Japanese friends. He said that the Japanese people and youth will forever receive the full support of the 130 million Chinese youth in their patriotic anti-U.S. struggle.

Yang Jingren emphasized that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people. Opposing U.S. imperialism is the common task and common interest of the Chinese and Japanese people and youth. Only through mutual solidarity and mutual support in our common struggle can we defeat U.S. imperialism and safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

Yang Jingren said that the Japanese people are a great people, and they have never been willing to endure the humiliation of being under U.S. rule. With the support of the people of the world, they will surely be able to drive U.S. imperialism out of Japanese territory and will surely win the victory in the struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

Head of the delegation, Shige Kusonohashi, was invited to speak. He first conveyed the fighting friendship of the Japanese youth to the Chinese youth. He said that the vast number of Japanese youth and women, together with the Japanese workers, stand at the forefront of the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and this struggle has already achieved a great victory. He said that the great Chinese people and youth fully support the Japanese people and youth in their patriotic anti-U.S. struggle, and in particular, Chairman Mao's evaluation of the Japanese people's struggle has given the Japanese people and youth tremendous encouragement.

The head of the delegation said that through a series of struggles against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the Japanese people and youth have increasingly realized that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people, and we must unite to wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism. He also said that the Japanese people have deeply realized in the patriotic anti-U.S. struggle that by strengthening the solidarity of the entire people with the working class as the center, any violence will be crushed.

The head of the delegation said that the people of Japan and China have a deep friendship, and neither mountains nor oceans can stop our friendship and amity. This friendship will be further developed.

Shige Kusonohashi also said that the Chinese people are holding high the three red banners and carrying out great socialist construction. We are pleased that we will be able to learn about the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes during our upcoming visit. He expressed that he will definitely bring the situation seen in China and the friendship of the Chinese people and youth to the Japanese people and youth.

Today's meeting was organized by the All-China Youth Federation and the Beijing Youth Federation. The meeting was presided over by Sun Fuling, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Youth Federation.
