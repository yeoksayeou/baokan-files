How Wuqiao County Organs are Implementing the "Two-Five System"
The Wuqiao County Party Committee Office　Our Reporter

The "Two-Five System" has been widely implemented among the county-level organs, communes, and management area cadres in Wuqiao County. How exactly is the "Two-Five System" being implemented in the various departments of the county-level organs? How is the forefront of production being strengthened? How is the central task of agricultural production being integrated with departmental business? How is large-scale collaboration of office work being organized? Here, we would like to provide a brief answer to these questions.

	Strengthening the Front Line of Production

The main purpose of Wuqiao County's implementation of the "Two-Five System" is to strengthen leadership at the forefront of production and ensure the realization of an all-round Great Leap Forward centered on agricultural production. To achieve this goal, the County Party Committee decided to transfer 70% of the cadres from the various county departments to the forefront of production. Of the 1,413 cadres in the county departments, 1,000 cadres regularly go to the front line, accounting for 70% of the total number of cadres. Among them, 202 cadres are permanently responsible for the overall production work of production teams (fixed for one year), attending meetings and studying work in the commune for two days, without returning to the office, accounting for 20% of the total number of cadres going to the grassroots. Another 233 cadres go to factories to take responsibility for factories and workshops, participating in production and leading production. Other cadres going to the front line participate in production, lead production, and conduct business work through central tasks (returning to the office for two days to attend meetings, study work). Among the 25 members of the County Party Committee in the county departments, including six secretaries, one secretary is always in the office to grasp the overall situation and guide the work of the office, while the remaining five secretaries participate in production and lead production in different areas. Among the remaining members of the County Party Committee, three members are always working in the office, while other members regularly go to the grassroots, including seven members who are responsible for communes and teams, fixed for one year.

In order to ensure that the central task is combined with business, the proportion of cadres permanently responsible for teams varies according to the nature of the work of each department. There are roughly four situations: First, departments such as Party, government, and mass organizations that are directly related to agricultural production but not very business-oriented, 20% to 30% of the cadres do office work, and 70% to 80% of the cadres go to the front line, of which about two-thirds of the cadres are permanently responsible for teams, and one-third of the cadres conduct business through central tasks. Second, departments with strong business orientation such as the Bureau of Commerce, the Bureau of Grain, and the political and legal departments, about 30% of the cadres do office work, and 70% of the cadres go to the front line, of which about one-third of the cadres are permanently responsible for teams, and two-thirds of the cadres conduct business through central tasks. Third, departments with very strong business orientation, such as broadcasting stations, post and telecommunications bureaus, and hospitals, in addition to the professional personnel who cannot be moved, about 30% of the other personnel do office work, and about 70% of the personnel go to the front line, generally not permanently responsible for teams. Fourth, in the industrial system, 233 cadres go to factories to participate in production and lead production, of which 201 cadres are responsible for factories and workshops. In addition, in the central work offices, a few people grasp the overall situation in the office, responsible for liaison up and down, writing materials, and most people go to the countryside to conduct investigations and research, and collect information.

In this way, it ensures that a large number of cadres go to the forefront of production, and effectively strengthens the grass-roots leadership on all fronts. In the county’s 816 production teams, each production team has an average of three cadres who are detached from production, plus the cadres of the production team, so that each of the 2,960 production brigades in the county has cadres above the production team level assigned to the brigade.

	Integrating the Central Task with Departmental Business

Will the transfer of a large number of cadres from the county-level organs to strengthen the frontline of agricultural production affect the business work of the departments? The facts in Wuqiao County answer that it will not affect the business work of the departments. On the contrary, only through the central task of agricultural production can the business of the departments be done well. Through the development of the central task, drive the development of business.

While focusing on agriculture as the foundation and first grasping agriculture, the Wuqiao County Party Committee made unified arrangements for the business work of various departments. Party committees at all levels absorb relevant business departments to participate in the study of central tasks; and at the same time as arranging central tasks, uniformly deploy the business work of relevant departments. Under the unified leadership of the County Party Committee, a situation has formed in which the entire Party is doing central work, and the entire Party is also doing business work. For example, although the Propaganda Department used to organize reporter teams to go to the countryside, it could not do so regularly. After the implementation of the "Two-Five System", a large number of cadres went to the grassroots, and the Party Committee uniformly assigned them the task of being reporters. The Propaganda Department specifically organized and guided them, and quickly organized a reporter team of 1,100 people, and a propaganda army of more than 150,000 people, combined with production, and widely carried out propaganda work, which improved the ideological understanding of the masses and thus brought into play greater production enthusiasm. The masses said, "In the past, some things seemed to be in a sealed gourd, but now the cadres have explained them clearly, and the enthusiasm for production is even greater."

The cadres of various departments of the county-level organs who went to the countryside, while participating in production and leading production, understood the actual needs of production and actively served production and developed the business of their own departments. The Wuqiao County Bank has a total of 39 people. After the implementation of the "Two-Five System", 30 people regularly went to the countryside to participate in production labor and went deep into the grassroots to work, changing the work style of "sitting at the door and waiting for customers." In the past, production teams had to go through four procedures for loans: application, investigation, approval, and issuance. After participating in production and going deep into reality, they understood the needs of production and took the initiative to issue loans rationally. In the past three months, the bank and credit cooperatives have actively sent loans to more than 800 production teams more than 1,000 times, truly making agricultural loans strongly support production. The Bureau of Commerce originally had 156 cadres, 35 of whom were permanently responsible for teams, and 99 of whom went deep into production. In production, they quickly found out the supply of materials needed for agricultural production in the second quarter, and prepared 3.9 million yuan of production materials in advance. All of this shows that only by going deep into production, fully understanding the production situation, can the business work of various departments closely follow the needs of production, and a situation of double leaps forward in production and business will emerge.

A large number of county-level organ cadres go to the countryside to take responsibility for production teams, cultivate typical examples, gain experience, and guide the overall situation. In the past, various departments also paid attention to cultivating typical examples and summarizing experience, but now, due to the large number of cadres going to the countryside, especially the leading cadres going to the countryside, maintaining close contact with the large number of new things and new problems, experience will be summarized faster, more, and better, and will be promoted more quickly. The 13 cadres of the Organization Department, 10 of them went to the countryside. They each took responsibility for a first-class branch and a third-class branch as key points, and under the premise of ensuring that agricultural production is the center, they summarized the experience of departmental work. The branch they cultivated in the Shangcun Production Team of Laiyuan Commune summarized the experience of "red family for Communist Party members," and promoted the experience of "Communist Party members' red family driving the masses' red family" universally. Among the 19,000 Communist Party members in the county, 9,502 Communist Party members have met the requirements of the red family; among the 10,854 farm households in the county, 4,234 farm households have met the requirements of the red family. Cadres of the Rural Work Department created the management experience of seven-day plans, three-day arrangements, fixed tasks on time, and fixed people according to tasks in the Shuangliudian Brigade of Chengguan Commune, and the work efficiency was increased by more than double. The County Party Committee held an on-site meeting here and promoted this experience, so that a mass movement of full attendance and high work efficiency immediately appeared in the county. When the "Two-Five System" was first implemented, some people said, "Doing central work cannot do business, doing business cannot do central work, one person cannot be used for two purposes, and cannot be in two places at once." Now practice has convinced them and made them more confident in combining central work with departmental business.

The cadres of various departments of the county-level organs who go to the countryside to take responsibility for production teams have a fixed time of one year and are responsible for overall production, but it does not mean that they do not care about the business of the departments. While doing a good job in the central task, they also do a good job in the business work of their own production teams. The County Party Committee put forward the call for "double red flags for central work and departmental business" to the cadres who went to the countryside to take responsibility for production teams. Many departments stipulate that the cadres who go to the countryside to take responsibility for production teams should do a good job in business work by combining the three while doing a good job in production. The content of the three combinations is: combining understanding of production situation with understanding of business situation, combining grasping production with grasping business, combining grasping key points with promoting general, doing business well without leaving production, grasping production and business together. In order to better play the role of cadres going to the countryside, the cadres of various departments of the county departments who go to the countryside to take responsibility for production teams can regularly return to the office to participate in departmental meetings, report on the situation, and raise issues.

Due to the adoption of these measures, agricultural production has been greatly promoted, and at the same time, the business work of various departments has also shown a new look. The 21 county-level business departments of the Finance and Trade Department, the Industry Bureau, and the Culture and Education Bureau, which have participated in the Tianjin City competition, have all been rated as upstream due to their support for production and development of business. A large number of cadres go deep down, undergo the training of actual work, and quickly improve their political and ideological level and improve their business work ability, which is conducive to the further development of departmental business work. In order to better combine central work with departmental business, various departments are further summarizing experience, so that cadres can better conduct face-to-face activities in a planned and purposeful manner under the premise of serving the center, and avoid the situation of "eating a hit-and-run meal."

	Organizing Office Work Collaboration

After the implementation of the "Two-Five System", the meetings, reports, documents, and affairs of the various departments of the county-level organs have been greatly reduced. The cadres staying in the office are more convenient to study major issues, grasp the overall situation of the work, and improve the quality of the work. However, the number of people staying in the office has been greatly reduced, and it is necessary to organize office work collaboration well in order to adapt to the needs of the situation.

Adhere to putting politics in command, fully mobilize all positive factors, and educate the cadres staying in the office to go all out, strive for the upstream, and do a good job in office work quickly, well, and economically, and compete with the cadres going to the countryside. This is an important part of doing a good job in office work after the implementation of the "Two-Five System". The Party branch strengthened specific ideological education work and organizational work, and launched an upstream and downstream competition, a counterpart competition, and an opponent competition among all cadres, everyone made a plan, everyone made a guarantee, internal and external cooperation. At the beginning, some people in the Rural Work Department of the County Party Committee were afraid that the majority of people would go to the countryside and affect the business work, and held a negative attitude to deal with it. They said, "How many people are asked to go to the countryside, that many people will go to the countryside, and there is no opinion if they all go down. If the task is not completed, go to the County Party Committee." In response to this situation, the department organized all cadres to study the decision of the County Party Committee on the leadership method of implementing the "Two-Five System", as well as relevant documents on improving the leadership style, and conducted a great roaring, a great letting go, and a great debate on whether the implementation of the "Two-Five System" affects business or promotes business, whether contradictions can be resolved, and how to resolve them. They unified their understanding and determined to do a good job in the business of the department. In order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of cadres and give play to the spirit of collaboration, some departments put forward the slogan of "one member becomes multiple members, one chief becomes multiple chiefs, one person has multiple skills, one specialty has multiple abilities, and one person is worth three or five people," which aroused the enthusiastic response of the vast number of cadres.

In departments with more complex business, after transferring a large number of cadres to the countryside, internal collaboration within the department can be organized. The Bureau of Commerce used to have five offices, the Cotton and Hemp Office, the Diversified Economy Office, the Drought Resistance Office, the Red Flag Office, and the Administrative Office, with a total of 23 cadres. Each office held a telephone and asked the lower level for materials and figures all day long. Now, 17 cadres have been transferred to the countryside, and a comprehensive office has been established, leaving only six cadres, who have taken over the work of the past five offices. Due to the large-scale collaboration, the cadres going to the countryside can also report the situation in a timely manner. The leaders of the department are very satisfied and say, "The work of the office is done very well." The bank has five departments, including the Agricultural Finance Department, the Savings Department, the Accounting Department, the Credit Department, and the Planning Department, with a total of 39 cadres. Except for the five tellers who cannot be moved, 12 cadres who are responsible for production teams in the countryside are transferred, and 18 people who are engaged in business in combination with the central work (including urban and town business) are transferred to the countryside. Only 9 people insist on daily work in the office. The joint office was established to organize collaboration and do the work of the original five departments. In the past, many departments were divided into many small stalls, and the leaders were busy dealing with the scattered problems of various small stalls and could not go deep down. Now there are ups and downs, the upper and lower levels are combined, unified management, active cooperation, and the appearance of office work has been greatly changed.

For departments with relatively similar business content and fewer cadres, collaboration between departments can be organized. In this way, the view that there are too few people to go down is also broken. The Organization Department, the Propaganda Department, and the Supervision Committee have similar work content, with a total of 33 people. After they organized collaboration, 26 people went to the countryside, 14 of whom were permanently responsible for production teams, and only 7 people stayed at home. Sometimes, all the comrades of the Organization Department go to the countryside, and the affairs at home are handled by the comrades of other departments who stay at home. Some things that can be handled on the spot are handled immediately. Some things that cannot be handled immediately are recorded for delivery. Some things that one department cannot handle with the people staying at home are handled jointly by the people from the three departments. The three departments of the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the Armed Work Department have similar work content and work objects, and the people staying at home also organized collaboration.

The county-level organs can uniformly organize forces for the common work of various departments to avoid duplication and improve work efficiency. For example, in the statistical work, the county statistics section has nine cadres, and the 27 departments in the county also have 34 full-time statisticians. The statistics section wants to conduct statistics, and various departments also want to conduct statistics, with a large number of clues. After the implementation of the "Two-Five System", the county concentrated the statistical cadres of various departments to the statistics section. In addition to streamlining 10 cadres, there are still 33 people, of whom 24 people regularly go to the countryside to engage in business in combination with the central work of agricultural production. There are 9 people in the office who do regular work and provide unified leadership. They compile the many lines of various departments into one braid, unify the statistical work, concentrate the forces, and greatly facilitate the statistical work of various departments.

In addition to the cadres who work in the office organizing collaboration, each department also organized internal and external collaboration and implemented the method of "grasping everything when going down and dividing the family when returning", which greatly reduced the affairs of the office work. For example, the cadres who went to the countryside from the three departments of the Organization Department, the Propaganda Department, and the Supervision Committee, in addition to paying attention to the business of their own departments, also entrusted each other to understand relevant situations. Helping to solve problems, so that many problems are solved at the bottom, and do not have to be raised to the office. According to statistics for the past three months, the cadres who went to the countryside from the three departments helped each other solve more than 30 problems. Due to the collaboration of cadres going to the countryside, the affairs in the office are relatively reduced. In addition to grasping the situation of the business of their respective departments, the cadres who went to the countryside from the three departments also comprehensively cared about the business of other departments. When returning to the county on Tuesday to study the work, they exchange work situations with each other, raise questions, and hand them over to the competent departments for unified study and solution.

The above facts tell us that as long as the collaboration is organized scientifically, office work can be done well and the quality can be improved. In the past, some departments had frequent meetings and reports, and too many documents, and many people only had the power to parry and no power to fight back. Now that the "Two-Five System" has been implemented, although there are fewer people, due to mutual collaboration and proper matching, everything is active, and a clear situation has emerged in which office work is handled clearly. Some people once felt that the implementation of the "Two-Five System" disrupted the office work and made it look out of shape. No, the office work is showing a new look, a look that meets the needs of the production situation. People must gradually get used to doing such office work. It is necessary to establish a certain system in the collaboration of office work. Only in this way can it be maintained regularly. More importantly, all aspects of the collaboration must be active in everything, carry forward the communist style, and persist in it.

    吴桥县县级机关是怎样执行“二五制”的
    中共吴桥县委办公室　本报记者
    “二五制”在吴桥县的县级机关、公社、管理区三级干部中已经普遍推行了。在县级机关各部门中究竟怎样执行“二五制”？怎样加强生产第一线？怎样把农业生产中心工作同部门业务结合起来？怎样组织机关工作大协作？这里就想对这些问题作一个简要的回答。
      加强生产第一线
    吴桥县实行“二五制”的主要目的，是为了加强生产第一线的领导，保证实现以农业生产为中心的全面大跃进。为了达到这个要求，县委决定从县直各部门抽调70％的干部深入生产第一线。县直共一千四百一十三名干部，经常深入第一线的干部达一千人，占干部总数的70％，其中固定包生产小队的全面生产工作（固定一年），两天参加公社的开会研究工作、学习，不回机关的干部占二百零二人，占深入基层干部总数的20％，另有二百三十三名干部深入工厂包厂包车间，参加生产、领导生产。深入第一线的其他干部，参加生产，领导生产，通过中心工作搞好业务工作（两天回机关开会、研究工作、学习）。在县直机关的县委委员共二十五名，六名书记，除有一名书记经常在机关掌握全面，指导机关工作以外，其余五名书记分片参加生产、领导生产。其余县委委员中，有三名委员经常在机关工作，其他委员经常深入基层，其中有七名委员做包社、包队工作，固定一年。
    为了保证中心兼顾业务，根据各部门的工作性质不同，对固定包队干部的抽调比例有所不同。大体分以下四种情况：第一、同农业生产有直接关系而又业务性不强的党、政、群众团体等部门，20％到30％农的干部做机关工作，70％到80％的干部深入第一线，其中三分之二左右的干部固定包队，三分之一的干部通过中心搞业务。第二、业务性较强的部门如商业局、粮食局、政法部门，等等，30％左右的干部做机关工作，70％的干部深入第一线，其中三分之一左右的干部固定包队，三分之二的干部通过中心搞业务。第三、业务性很强的部门，如广播站、邮电局、医院等，除了不能动的专业人员外，其他人员30％左右的人做机关工作，70％左右的人深入第一线，一般不固定包队。第四、工业系统的干部有二百三十三名干部深入到工厂参加生产领导生产，其中有二百零一名干部包厂、包车间。另外，各中心工作办公室，有少数人在机关掌握全面情况，负责上下联系，写材料，多数人下乡进行调查研究，搜集情况。
    这样一来，就保证了大批干部深入生产第一线，切实加强了各个战线上的基层领导。全县八百一十六个生产队，每个生产队平均有脱产干部三人，加上生产队的干部，使全县二千九百六十个生产小队，达到每个小队都有生产队以上的干部包队。中心工作与部门业务相结合
    县级机关各部门抽调大批干部加强农业生产第一线，会不会影响部门业务工作？吴桥县的事实回答是，不影响部门业务工作，相反，只有通过农业生产的中心工作，才能把部门的业务做好。通过中心工作的发展，带动业务的发展。
    吴桥县县委在以农业为基础，首先抓农业的同时，对各部门的业务工作作了统一安排。各级党委在研究中心工作的同时，吸收有关业务部门参加；在安排中心工作的同时，统一布置有关部门的业务工作。在县委的统一领导下，就形成了中心工作全党做，业务工作也是全党做的局面。比如，宣传部过去虽然组织报告员队伍下乡，但总不能经常。实行“二五制”以后，大批干部深入基层，党委统一布置给他们作报告员的任务，宣传部门具体组织指导，就迅速组织起一支一千一百人的报告员队伍，十五万多人的宣传大军，结合生产，广泛进行宣传工作，提高了广大群众的思想认识，从而发挥了更大的生产积极性。群众说，“过去有些事好像在闷葫芦中一样，现在干部给说亮了，生产劲头更大了。”
    县级机关各部门下乡干部一面参加生产，领导生产，一面了解生产实际需要，积极为生产服务，发展本部门业务。吴桥县银行，共有三十九人，实行“二五制”以后，经常有三十人下乡参加生产劳动，深入基层工作，改变了
  “坐门等客”的作风。过去生产队贷款，必须经过申请、调查、批准、发放四道手续。而经过参加生产，深入实际，了解到生产的需要，他们就主动合理地发放贷款。三个月来，银行和信用部主动给八百多个生产队送贷款一千多次，真正使农贷工作有力地支持了生产。商业局原有一百五十六名干部，固定包队的三十五人，深入生产的九十九人。他们在生产中，很快就摸清了第二季度的农业生产需要的供应物资，提前备齐了三百九十万元的生产资料。所有这些都说明，只有深入生产，充分了解生产情况，各部门业务工作才能紧紧跟上生产需要，出现生产、业务双跃进的局面。
    县级机关部门大批下乡干部深入基层，搞好生产，培养典型，取得经验，指导全盘。过去各部门也注意培养典型，总结经验，但是，现在由于大批干部下乡，特别是领导干部下乡，与大量出现的新事物、新问题保持密切联系，经验就会更快、更多、更好地总结出来，并且又会更快地推广，组织部十三个干部，有十人下乡。他们分别包一个一类支部、一个三类支部作为重点，在保证搞好以农业生产为中心的前提下，总结部门工作经验。他们在来园公社上村生产队培养的支部，总结了“党员之家全家红”，“党员全家红带动群众全家红”的经验，普遍推广。在全县一万九千多名党员中，就有九千五百零二名党员达到了全家红的要求；在全县一万零八百五十四户农户中，就有四千二百三十四户农户达到了全家红的要求。农村工作部干部在城关公社双刘店大队，创造了七天一计划，三天一安排，按时定活，按活定人管理经验，工效提高一倍多。县委在这里召开了现场会，推广了这个经验，使全县立即出现了一个出全勤、高工效的群众运动。初推行“二五制”时，有人说：“做中心工作就不能搞业务，搞业务就不能做中心工作，一身不能二用，不会分身法。”现在实践说服了他们，使他们更有信心把中心工作和部门业务结合起来。
    县级机关各部门下乡包生产队的干部，固定时间一年，负责全盘生产，但是，并不是对部门业务就不管了。他们在做好中心工作的同时，也做好所包的本生产队的业务工作。县委对下乡包生产队的干部，提出了“中心工作和部门业务双插红旗”的号召。许多部门规定下乡包生产队的干部，在搞好生产的同时，要用三结合的办法做好业务工作。三结合的内容是，了解生产情况与了解业务情况相结合，抓生产与抓业务相结合，抓重点与推动一般相结合，做好业务不离生产，生产业务一齐抓。为了更好地发挥下乡干部的作用，县直各部门下乡包生产队的干部，可以定期回到机关，参加部门会议，反映情况，提出问题。
    由于采取了这些措施，大大地推动了农业生产，同时各部门的业务工作也出现了新的面貌。已经参加天津市评比的财贸部、工业局、文教局等二十一个县直业务部门，由于支持生产，发展业务，全部被评为上游。大批干部深入下去，经受实际工作的锻炼，更快地提高了政治思想水平，提高了业务工作能力，有助于部门业务工作的进一步开展。为了把中心工作和部门业务更好地结合起来，各部门正在进一步总结经验，使干部在为中心服务的前提下，更好地有计划有目的地进行面的活动，避免“吃碰头食”的情况。
      组织机关工作协作
    实行“二五制”以后，县级机关各部门的会议、表报、文件、事务大大减少了。留在机关的干部更便于研究重大问题，掌握工作的全面情况，提高工作的质量。但是，留在机关的人大大减少了，必须很好地组织机关工作协作，才能适应形势的需要。
    坚持政治挂帅，充分动员一切积极因素，教育留在机关的干部鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地做好机关工作，同下乡干部竞赛。这是在执行“二五制”后做好机关工作的重要一环。党支部加强了具体的思想教育工作和组织工作，在全体干部中开展了上下竞赛，对口竞赛，对手竞赛，人人订计划、个个提保证，内外协作。县委农村工作部开始有人怕多数人下乡，影响业务工作，抱着消极应付的态度，他们说“叫多少人下乡，就多少人下乡，都下去也没意见，完不成任务找县委。”针对这个情况，部内就组织全体干部学习县委关于执行“二五制”领导方法的决定，以及有关改进领导作风的文件，就推行“二五制”是影响业务还是促进业务，有矛盾能否解决？怎样解决？进行了大鸣、大放、大辩论，统一了认识，决心把本部门业务搞好。为了充分调动干部的积极性，发挥协作精神，有些部门提出了“一员变多员，一长变多长，一人多艺，一专多能，一人要抵三、五人”的口号，引起了广大干部的热烈响应。
    在业务比较复杂的部门内，抽出大批干部下乡后，可组织部门内的协作。商业局过去有五个办公室，棉麻办公室，多种经济办公室，抗旱办公室、红旗办公室，行政办公室，共有二十三个干部，一个办公室拤住一部电话机，成天向下边要材料，要数字。现在抽出了十七个干部下乡，成立了综合办公室，只留下干部六人，就把过去五个办公室的工作包下来了。由于大搞协作，下乡干部又能及时反映情况，部门领导同志很满意地说，“办公室的工作，干得挺好。”银行有农金股、储蓄股、会计股、信贷股、计划股等五个股，共三十九个干部，除去五个营业员不能动的以外，抽出下乡包生产队的干部十二人，还有下乡结合中心工作搞业务（包括市镇业务）的十八人，在机关坚持日常工作的只有九人。成立联合办公室，组织协作，把原来五个股的工作做起来。过去许多部门内分成许多小摊子，领导干部忙于处理各个小摊子零星问题，深入不下去。现在有上有下，上下结合，统一归口，主动协作，就大大改变了机关工作的面貌。
    业务内容比较相近的部门，干部人数又较少的，可以组织部门之间的协作。这样，那种认为人少下不去的看法，也就被打破了。组织部、宣传部、监察委员会三个部门的工作内容相近，一共有三十三人。他们组织了协作以后，下乡二十六人，其中十四人固定包生产队，留在家中的只有七人。有的时候，组织部的同志全部下乡，家中的事情，就由其他部门留在家中的同志代办。有些事情可以代办的，就即时代办。有些不能即时代办的，就记下来作交代。有些事情，一个部门留在家中的人办不过来的，就由三个部门的人共同办理。共青团、妇联、武装工作部三个部门，由于工作内容和工作对象相近，他们留在家中的人，也组织了协作。
    县级机关各部门带有共同性的工作，可以统一组织力量，避免重复，提高工作效率。比如统计工作，县里统计科有九个干部，县二十七个部门还有专职统计员三十四人。统计科要统计，各部门也要统计，头绪纷繁。实行“二五制”以后，县里把各部门的统计干部集中到统计科，除去精减了十个干部以外，还有三十三人，其中有二十四人经常下乡，结合农业生产中心工作搞业务。机关中有九人做经常工作，统一领导，把各部门的许多线编成了一条辫子，统计工作归口统一，力量集中，大大有利于各部门的统计工作。
    各个部门除了在机关工作的干部组织协作以外，还组织了内外协作，实行“下去一把抓，回来再分家”的办法，大大减少了机关工作的事务。比如组织部、宣传部、监察委员会三个部门的下乡干部，除了注意本部门的业务以外，还互相委托了解有关情况。帮助解决问题，使许多问题在下边就解决了，不必提到机关中来。据三个月来的统计，三个部门下乡干部互相帮助解决的问题就有三十多个。由于下乡干部的协作，就相对地减轻了机关中的事务。三个部门的下乡干部，除各自掌握本部门业务的情况外，也全面关心其他部门的业务。在星期二回县研究工作时，再互相交流工作情况，提出问题，交给主管部门统一研究解决。
    以上的事实告诉我们，只要科学地组织协作，机关工作是完全可以做好，并能提高质量的。过去有些部门由于会议汇报频繁，文件太多，许多人只有招架之功，并无还手之力。现在执行了“二五制”，虽然人少，由于互相协作，搭配恰当，事事主动，却出现了机关工作办得清清楚楚的局面。曾有人感到，推行“二五制”，机关工作打乱了，不成样子。不是的，机关工作正出现了新的样子，适应生产形势需要的样子。人们要逐步习惯来做这样的机关工作。在机关工作协作中间，建立一定的制度是必要的。只有这样，才能保持经常。更重要的是协作的各方面要事事主动，发扬共产主义的风格，并坚持下去。
