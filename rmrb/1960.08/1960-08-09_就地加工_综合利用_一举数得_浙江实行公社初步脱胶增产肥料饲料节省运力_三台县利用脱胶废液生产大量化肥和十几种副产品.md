Zhejiang Province has recently widely adopted a method of double degumming by factories and rural people's communes. The method is this: after wild and miscellaneous fibers are collected, they are first preliminarily degummed in the people's communes and production teams in the producing areas, and then transported to large textile factories for refining according to the needs of textile products. At present, communes and production teams in the wild and miscellaneous fiber producing areas throughout the province have universally established indigenous preliminary degumming factories. At the same time, fiber refining workshops or fiber refining and degumming factories have been established in textile factories in Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou and other places accordingly.

This method has many advantages. Communes running degumming factories can provide large quantities of fertilizers and feeds for agricultural production, promote the development of commune industries and increase the income of commune members, and increase the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members to collect wild fibers; when factories refine, they can reduce the consumption of chemical raw materials by about two-thirds, and greatly improve the quality of the fibers. In addition, after the initial degumming, the volume of wild and miscellaneous fibers can be reduced by an average of three-quarters, which can also reduce the amount of transportation.

Recently, Santai County, Sichuan Province, closely integrated the comprehensive utilization of degumming waste liquid with the movement of accumulating and making fertilizers. In two months, more than 270 comprehensive processing plants were built, using degumming waste liquid to produce large quantities of chemical fertilizers and more than ten other by-products, making the large-scale production of wild and miscellaneous fibers an indispensable part of agricultural production increase. The masses reflected: "In the past, fiber factories were established reluctantly; today, if fiber factories are not established, people feel anxious; comprehensive utilization produces more fertilizers, increases income and grows more grain."

Santai County's large-scale comprehensive utilization of degumming waste liquid started from the Feima Supply and Marketing Cooperative Fiber Factory. The factory's employees discovered that crops grew particularly well in places where degumming waste liquid had been poured, and they thought that the fiber waste liquid must contain fertilizer efficiency, so they extracted fertilizer from the waste liquid. After a vigorous technical revolution, in addition to processing 65 jin of rayon from 100 jin of coir raw materials, they also used waste liquid to extract more than 200 jin of quick-acting fertilizer, 150 jin of soil fertilizer powder, and more than 10 jin of pesticides and other ten kinds of by-products. They also processed 48 jin of cotton hemp and more than 70 jin of quick-acting fertilizer, about 10 jin of baked glue, and other seven kinds of by-products from 100 jin of cotton stalk skin. This fiber processing factory has also become an indigenous chemical fertilizer factory. Due to the close combination with agriculture, it has received more support from the masses. In addition, the Feima Supply and Marketing Cooperative Fiber Factory has greatly reduced its costs since it started large-scale comprehensive utilization. Now, in addition to recovering all of its investment, it has also accumulated more than 10,000 yuan in funds.

    就地加工　综合利用　一举数得
    浙江实行公社初步脱胶增产肥料饲料节省运力
    三台县利用脱胶废液生产大量化肥和十几种副产品
    最近，浙江省广泛采用了工厂、农村人民公社两次脱胶的办法。这种办法是：野杂纤维采集下来以后，先在产地的人民公社和生产队初步脱胶，然后再运到大纺织厂，根据纺织产品的需要，进行精炼加工。现在，全省野杂纤维产地的公社和生产队，已普遍建立了土法初制脱胶厂。同时，在杭州、宁波、温州等地纺织厂相应地建立了纤维精炼车间或纤维精炼脱胶厂。
    这种办法好处很多。公社办脱胶厂，可以为农业生产提供大量肥料、饲料，促进公社工业发展和增加社员收入，提高广大社员采集野生纤维的积极性；工厂精炼时，又能够减少化工原料消耗用量三分之二左右，而且大大提高了纤维的质量。此外，经过初次脱胶，野杂纤维的体积平均能够缩小四分之三，还可以减少运输量。
            ＊＊
    最近，四川省三台县把综合利用脱胶废液和积肥造肥运动紧密结合了起来，两个月当中，建起了二百七十多个综合加工厂，利用脱胶废液生产出了大量化学肥料和十几种其它副产品，使大搞野杂纤维成为农业增产不可缺少的一部分。群众反映说：“过去纤维厂，兴办带免强；今天纤维厂，不办心发痒；综合利用肥料多，多增收入多打粮。”
    三台县大搞脱胶废液综合利用是从飞马供销社纤维厂开始的。这个厂的职工发现倒过脱胶废液的地方庄稼长的特别好，便想到纤维废液中一定含有肥效，于是就从废液中提取肥料。经过大闹技术革命，他们在一百斤蓑草原料中，除加工出六十五斤人造棉外，还利用废液提取了二百多斤速效肥料、一百五十斤肥田粉、一百多斤农药等十种副产品。他们又从一百斤棉秆皮中加工出四十八斤棉麻和七十多斤速效肥料、十斤左右烤胶等七种副产品。这个纤维加工厂，同时也变成了土化肥厂。由于紧密地结合了农业，更加得到群众的支持。另外，飞马供销社纤维厂从大搞综合利用后，成本也大大降低。现在，他们除已经收回了全部投资外，还积累了一万多元资金。
