    Equipment Needed for Repairing Farm Tools
    Recently, newspapers across the country have been continuously publishing news about industrial and mining enterprises supporting agriculture, which we are genuinely happy to read. After our commune was established, we purchased eleven tractors, two grain combines, two large threshing machines, more than thirty tractor-drawn farm implements, and thirty-two diesel engines. Communization has greatly promoted the technical transformation of agriculture. However, this has also brought us a new problem: our repair capabilities cannot keep up with the growth of machinery. The higher authorities often require us to handle medium and minor repairs within the commune, but we lack repair tools. When relatively precise components malfunction, we are unable to do anything. Sending them out for repair takes at least a few days at the quickest, and sometimes it takes dozens of days. The diesel engines of two production teams in our Xiamiao Management Area have not been used for half a year because they could not be repaired in time. I think, a tractor can cultivate hundreds of mu of land every day, so if it breaks down and cannot be repaired in time, it will cause even greater delays.
    Therefore, we hope that when various regions support agricultural technical transformation, they can also provide some repair equipment, so that the machines can exert greater efficiency. (Ma Xiancheng, Huazhou People's Commune, Weinan County, Shaanxi)

    需要修理农具的设备
    最近各地报纸不断发表工矿企业支援农业的消息，我们读了真打心眼里高兴。我们公社在成立后购买了十一台拖拉机、两台谷物联合收割机、两台大型脱谷机、三十多台机引农具和三十二台柴油机，公社化大大促进了农业的技术改造。但是，这也给我们带来了一个新问题：修理能力赶不上机器的增长。上级经常要求我们中修、小修不出社，可是我们修理工具少，遇到比较精密的部件发生故障，就无从动手。拿到外边修理，最快也得好几天，有时得几十天才能修好。我们下庙管理区两个生产队的柴油机，由于不能及时修理，已有半年不能使用了。我想，一台拖拉机每天可耕地百十亩，如果发生故障，不能及时修理，耽误事就更大了。
    因此，我们希望各地支援农业技术改造时，也能支援一些修理设备，以便使机器发挥更大的效能。	（陕西渭南县华州人民公社　马现成）
