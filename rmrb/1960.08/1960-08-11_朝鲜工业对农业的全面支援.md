    Korean Industry's Comprehensive Support for Agriculture
    Korea, Kim Sung-jun

    Our country is transforming into an industrial-agricultural nation, opening up a new stage in industrial support for agriculture and enhancing the leading role of industry.

    Currently, in our country's economy, industry accounts for an overwhelming proportion (in 1959, the value of Korean industrial output already accounted for 70% of the total value of industrial and agricultural output). This situation means that the conditions for comprehensively strengthening industrial support for agriculture have been formed. At the same time, for the new leap forward of industry, it is required to develop agriculture at a faster rate than before.

    We must, on the basis of the achievements made in the past period of socialist industrialization, transform from an industrial-agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country and complete socialist construction as soon as possible. To this end, as Comrade Kim Il-sung has taught, it is necessary to develop agriculture to adapt to the development of industry; it is necessary to organically and correctly combine the development of industry and agriculture.

    Industry and agriculture, these two sectors, are interconnected. If the two are not adapted to each other, neither can develop smoothly. That is to say, without a strong socialist modern industry, there can be no developed socialist agriculture; without developed socialist agriculture, there can be no strong socialist modern industry. The development of industry itself is based on the premise of the development of agriculture as a supplier of raw materials and grain, and as a consumer of industrial products. Without developed agriculture, it is impossible to meet the needs of the national economy for raw materials and grain, nor can it expand agriculture's own demand for industrial products. Conversely, the development of industry, the large-scale supply of means of production (tractors, automobiles, agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, etc.) and necessities of life, is also an indispensable prerequisite for the advancement of agriculture.

    Therefore, industry and agriculture must support each other and adapt to each other. Only when the development of these two material production sectors is closely combined can the comprehensive upsurge of the socialist economy be guaranteed, and the conditions for the balanced development of the entire national economy can be formed.

    Our Party has consistently adhered to the principle of organically combining the development of industry and agriculture in formulating its own economic policies.

    Our Party's basic line of giving priority to the development of heavy industry while developing light industry and agriculture is a concrete manifestation of this principle.

    This is what the working people commonly call "advancing with two horses" or "two-headed Chollima".

    Today, strengthening the comprehensive production and technical support of industry to agriculture is to adhere to the basic line of our party's economic construction in the changed new environment.

    What is the main content of industrial support for agriculture at this stage?

    Today, the urgent problem facing our country's agriculture is to overcome the difference in technical level between industry and agriculture. Our industry is rapidly carrying out expanded reproduction on the basis of the latest modern technology, while agriculture has not completely shaken off backward handicraft technology. Thus, the speed of production development cannot but be relatively low. If this situation continues for a long time, agriculture will not be able to keep up with industry, and the development of the entire national economy will be hindered. At the same time, "Only by realizing mechanization can our agricultural cooperatives truly become a consolidated socialist economy, production can be greatly improved, and the lives of farmers can be more prosperous." (Kim Il-sung: "Several Tasks Currently Facing Socialist Economic Construction")

    In this way, overcoming the difference in technical level between industry and agriculture at this stage has become the central issue for enabling agriculture to keep up with industry, comprehensively and rapidly developing the national economy, and further promoting the country's socialist construction.

    The Twelfth Enlarged Plenary Session of our Party Central Committee stipulated that promoting agricultural mechanization is the primary link in solving the central task of the buffer period, and called on the entire Party and the entire industry to mobilize to support agriculture. This is the reason.

    Over the past six years since the war, our country's industry has not only grown at an astonishing rate, but has also undergone tremendous changes in its structure. Compared with 1953, the production of means of production in 1959 increased by 12.7 times, and the production of consumer goods increased by 6 times; and the proportion of machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries in the total industrial output value reached 20.6% last year.

    This clearly shows that a heavy industry with an independent structure has been established in our country. It can not only well guarantee the technical transformation of the entire national economy, including industry but also agriculture.

    Today, our country's machinery manufacturing industry has reached the level where it can mass-produce modern machinery such as tractors and trucks, as well as various advanced agricultural machinery, and promote the comprehensive mechanization of agriculture. In the post-war period, great changes have also taken place in the layout of our country's industry. Industrial enterprises that maintain close ties with agricultural development are further closer to rural areas. All industrial enterprises have been reorganized in accordance with the production requirements of the entire national economy. In particular, thanks to our party's wise policies such as the machine tool production machine tool movement, the establishment of local industrial systems, and the simultaneous development of large and small industries, together with the large central industries, the small and medium-sized local industries have rapidly expanded and strengthened. Small and medium-sized machinery manufacturing factories have been established everywhere, no matter which province or city and county. In this way, today, from the central to the local levels, a system for the production and repair of agricultural machinery has been established, and it has been able to produce and supply more agricultural machinery and farm tools suitable for local characteristics in a timely manner.

    Today, the focus of industrial support for agriculture has shifted from the consumer-oriented support in the past, which was mainly to meet the living and cultural needs of the working farmers, to strengthening the comprehensive support for agricultural production and technology.

    This year, our country's industry will supply rural areas with 4,000 tractors, 3,000 automobiles, 15,000 trailers, and 10,000 combined threshers, 4,000 straw bag weaving machines and other power machinery, as well as 110,000 ox carts and 140,000 cultivators and weeders and other animal-powered agricultural machinery.

    The working class of our country, who have acted in unison to equip our rural areas with new technologies, are strengthening their ties with the farmers who directly use agricultural machinery, and are actively reflecting their requirements in production. As a result, the quality of agricultural machinery is being further improved. At the same time, they are eliminating the dogmatism that existed in the production of some agricultural machinery in the past, and are striving to produce agricultural machinery suitable for the characteristics of each locality.

    Today, our country's rural areas not only have favorable conditions for effectively accepting new industrial support in terms of ownership relations, but also in terms of material and technology. Water conservancy in rural areas in our country has been basically completed, electrification has achieved decisive success, and mechanization has also laid a certain foundation.

    Agricultural machinery stations, which serve as bases for the rural technical revolution, not only provide technical support to agriculture from a mechanical perspective, but also participate in collective production as members of agricultural production organizers, becoming masters who are jointly responsible for production achievements together with cooperatives. At the same time, the stations, which in the past mainly engaged in land cultivation and played an auxiliary role in agricultural production, have today expanded their scope of work, taking responsibility for land cultivation, sowing, weeding, transportation, harvesting, and other operations, playing a decisive role in the agricultural production operations of cooperatives.

    At the time when the agricultural technical revolution entered the stage of formal implementation, our Party dispatched a large technical force to the countryside. This will help rural areas more effectively utilize the technical equipment supplied by industry, enabling rural areas to firmly establish agricultural production work on the basis of science and technology. At the same time, through actual operations, they will train a large number of mechanical and technical cadres and agricultural and animal husbandry cadres that will be needed in the future, and establish a solid technical position in our country's rural areas.

    At this stage, industrial support for agriculture must not weaken the consumer links between urban and rural areas and neglect the significance of industrial support for meeting the living and cultural needs of farmers because the significance of production and technical support is particularly important. On the contrary, due to the advancement of the rural cultural revolution and the rapid improvement of farmers' lives, the working class must also provide farmers with more active support in this regard. Our country's industry must first and foremost more fully meet the ever-increasing needs of farmers for necessities of life. Of particular importance is that, while developing light industry, it is necessary to rapidly develop the many local industries that have already been newly built and expanded, expand the types and scale of consumer goods production, and resolutely improve product quality. Due to the extensive development of the cultural revolution, industry must mass-produce and supply rural cultural construction equipment.

    Since the rural technical and cultural revolutions contain serious ideological struggles, this urgently requires further strengthening the political and ideological leadership of the advanced working class over the peasants.

    Further strengthening industrial support for agriculture is not only a lawful requirement for our country's economic development, but also has great economic significance.

    First, strengthening industrial production and technical support for agriculture will transform our country's agriculture, which in the past was mainly based on heavy and inefficient manual labor, into an agriculture dominated by technology and culture, promoting the comprehensive upsurge of agricultural production.

    Relying on the active support of industry, our country's agriculture will, while rapidly increasing grain production, produce more vegetables, livestock products such as meat, and cash crops, fruits, silkworm cocoons and other agricultural products. In this way, agriculture will more fully meet the growing needs of urban industries and residents for grain, non-staple foods and raw materials.

    If agricultural productivity can be greatly improved in this way, and agriculture can fully meet the needs of rapidly developing industry, then the development of industry will form a new leap, and our "two-headed Chollima" will move forward more rapidly.

    Industrial support for agriculture will not only enrich the lives of the farmers themselves, but will also raise the lives of urban working people to a higher level.

    All of this means that efforts to solve the central tasks of the buffer period well, and preparations for winning a decisive victory in socialist construction in the next six or seven years, are progressing smoothly.

    Second, the more socialist industry strengthens its support for agriculture, and the more modern technology is used to equip agriculture, the more agricultural labor productivity will increase, and the greater the commodity rate of agricultural products will be. Moreover, in this process, agricultural labor will gradually become another form of industrial labor. In the value of agricultural products, the proportion of industrial labor will increase.

    At this stage, strengthening the comprehensive support of socialist industry for agriculture also has extremely important significance in further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

    The fundamental guarantee of socialist victory—the worker-peasant alliance—can ultimately be consolidated only when, first, its economic foundation, i.e., the relations of production, is consolidated and strengthened; and second, when the old ideological remnants of the peasants are overcome and they are armed with the advanced ideas of the working class.

    In order to transform the peasants' ideology with working-class thought, while strengthening their communist education, it is necessary to promote the rural technical revolution, especially agricultural mechanization, and further develop agricultural productivity. Strengthening industrial support for agriculture is of great significance for transforming the peasants' ideology so as to consolidate and develop the alliance of the working class and the peasants on a new basis. And when the alliance between the working class and the peasants is further consolidated, our country's socialist and communist construction will have a new upsurge.

    朝鲜工业对农业的全面支援
    朝鲜　金承俊
    我国变成为工业—农业国，在工业支援农业、提高工业的领导作用方面，开辟了新的阶段。
    目前在我国经济中，工业占压倒的比重（1959年朝鲜工业产值已占工农业总产值的70％）这一情况，就意味着全面加强工业对农业的支援的条件已经形成；同时，为了工业的新的跃进，要求以比以往更快的速度发展农业。
    我们必须在社会主义工业化过去时期所取得的成就的基础上，由工业—农业国变成为发达的社会主义工业国，早日完成社会主义建设。为此，正如金日成同志所教导的，必须发展农业，以适应工业的发展；必须使工业和农业的发展有机地正确地结合起来。
    工业和农业这两个部门，是相互联结着的。如果两者不相适应，就都不可能顺利地发展。就是说，没有强大的社会主义的现代工业，就不可能有发达的社会主义农业；没有发达的社会主义农业，也就不可能有强大的社会主义的现代工业。工业本身的发展，是以原料和粮食的供应者、工业产品的需要者即农业的发展为前提的。没有发达的农业，就不能满足人民经济对原料和粮食的需要，也不能扩大农业本身对工业产品的需要。反之，工业的发展，生产资料（拖拉机、汽车、农具、化学肥料等）和生活必需品的大量供应，对农业的前进来说，也是一种必不可少的前提条件。
    因此，工业和农业必须相互支援、相互适应。只有这两个物质生产部门的发展互相密切地结合起来，社会主义经济的全面高涨才能得到保障，整个人民经济的平衡发展的条件才能形成。
    我们党在制订自己的经济政策中，始终一贯地坚持了使工业和农业的发展有机地结合起来的原则。
    我们党的优先发展重工业，同时发展轻工业和农业的基本路线，正是这一原则的具体体现。
    这就是劳动人民所通俗地说的“双马前进”、“双头千里马”。
    今天，加强工业对农业的全面的生产和技术的支援，就是在变化了的新的环境下，坚持我党经济建设的基本路线。
    现阶段工业支援农业的主要内容是什么呢？
    今天，我国农业所面临的迫切问题是克服工农业之间技术水平上的差别。我国工业在现代化的最新技术的基础上，正在迅速地进行着扩大再生产，而农业还没有完全摆脱落后的手工业技术。从而，生产的发展速度就不能不相对地低下。如果这一情况长期持续下去，农业就将跟不上工业，而整个人民经济的发展，就将受到阻碍。同时，“只有实现机械化，我国的农业合作社才能真正成为巩固的社会主义经济，生产才能大大提高，农民生活才能更加富裕起来。”（金日成：“目前社会主义经济建设所面临的若干任务”）
    这样，克服现阶段工农业之间技术水平上的差别，就成了使农业跟上工业、全面地迅速发展人民经济、进一步促进国家的社会主义建设的中心问题。
    我党中央委员会十二月扩大全体会议，把促进农业机械化规定为解决缓冲期中心任务的首要环节，号召全党和全部工业动员起来，支援农业，其理由就在这里。
    我国的工业，战后六年来，不仅以惊人速度成长起来，而且在结构上也发生了巨大的变化。和1953年相比，1959年生产资料的生产增为十二点七倍，消费资料的生产增为六倍；而工业总产值中，机械制造及金属加工工业的比重，去年达到20.6％。
    这清楚地表明，我国具有独立结构的重工业已经建立起来了。它不仅可以很好地保证对工业而且对包括农业在内的整个人民经济实行技术改造。
    今天，我国的机械制造工业已经达到了可以大量生产像拖拉机、载重汽车这些现代机械等各种先进的农业机械、促进农业全面机械化的水平。战后时期，我国工业在布局上，也发生了巨大的变化。和农业发展保持着密切联系的工业企业进一步的接近了农村。所有工业企业都根据整个人民经济的生产要求，进行了改组。特别是由于机床生产机床运动、地方工业体系的建立以及大工业和中小工业并举等我党的这一切英明的政策，和中央的大工业一起，地方的中小工业迅速地扩大和加强了，无论哪个道或者哪个市和郡，到处都建立了中小机械制造工厂。这样，今天从中央到地方，都建立起了农业机械生产和修理体系，已经能够及时地生产和供应更多的适合地方特点的各种农业机械和农具。
    今天，工业支援农业的中心已经由过去时期主要为了满足劳动农民的生活和文化需要的消费性支援，转为加强对农业生产和技术的全面支援。
    今年，我国工业将要供应农村四千台拖拉机、三千辆汽车、一万五千辆拖车和一万台综合脱谷机、四千台草袋织造机等各种动力机械，以及十一万辆牛车和十四万台中耕机和除草机等畜力农业机械。
    为了用新的技术装备我国农村而一致行动起来的我国工人阶级，正在加强和直接使用农业机械的农民的联系，把他们的要求积极地反映到生产中来。因而，农业机械的质量正在进一步提高。同时，他们正在消除过去时期一部分农业机械生产中所存在的教条主义，努力生产适合各个地方特点的农业机械。
    今天，我国的农村不仅在所有制关系方面，而且在物质和技术方面，都具备了可以有效地接受工业的新的支援的有利条件。我国农村水利化已经基本上完成了，电气化已取得了决定性的成就，机械化也已打下了一定的基础。
    作为农村技术革命据点的农业机械作业所，不仅从机械技术上对农业进行支援，同时又作为农业生产组织者的一员，进行集体生产，成为同合作社一起对生产成就共同负责的主人。同时，过去主要从事土地翻耕，对农业生产起辅助作用的作业所，今天已扩大了工作范围，对土地翻耕和播种、除草、运输、收割等作业负责，在合作社的农业生产作业中，起着决定性的作用。
    在农业技术革命进入正式执行阶段的时候，我党给农村派遣了庞大的技术力量。这将帮助农村更加有效地运用工业供给的技术设备，使农村把农业生产工作牢固地建立在科学技术的基础上。同时，他们将通过实际作业过程，培养出今后大量需要的机械技术干部和农产、畜产干部，给我国农村建立起巩固的技术阵地。
    现阶段工业对农业的支援，绝不能因生产和技术支援的意义特别重要，而削弱城乡之间的消费性联系，忽视满足农民生活和文化需要的工业支援的意义。相反，由于农村文化革命的推进和农民生活的迅速提高，工人阶级在这方面也必须给农民更加积极的支援。我国工业首先必须更加圆满地满足日益增长的农民对生活必需品的需要。特别重要的是，在发展轻工业的同时，要迅速发展业已新建和扩建起来的许多地方工业，扩大消费品生产的种类和规模，坚决提高产品质量。由于文化革命的广泛展开，工业必须大量生产和供应农村文化建设器材。
    由于农村的技术革命和文化革命包含着严重的思想斗争，这就迫切地要求进一步加强先进的工人阶级对农民的政治的和思想的领导。
    进一步加强工业对农业的支援，不仅是我国经济发展的合乎规律的要求，而且具有巨大的经济意义。
    第一，加强工业对农业的生产和技术的支援，将使过去主要以繁重的和生产效率不高的手工劳动为基础的我国农业，转变成为技术和文化占统治地位的农业，促进农业生产的全面高涨。
    我国农业依靠工业的积极支援，在迅速增加粮食生产的同时，将会生产出更多的菜蔬、肉类等畜产品和经济作物、水果、蚕茧等农产品。这样，农业就会更圆满地满足城市工业和居民对粮食、副食品和原料的日益增长的需要。
    如果农业生产力能够这样大大提高，农业能够圆满地满足迅速发展着的工业的需要，那末工业的发展就会形成一个新的飞跃，我们的“双头千里马”就会更加迅猛地前进。
    工业对农业的支援，不仅将使农民本身的生活富裕起来，而且也将使城市劳动人民的生活提高到更高的水平。
    所有这一切都意味着，争取很好地解决缓冲期的中心任务，在今后六、七年内，在社会主义建设中赢得决定性胜利的进军准备，正在顺利地进行着。
    第二，愈是加强社会主义工业对农业的支援，愈是用现代技术装备农业，农业劳动生产率就愈加提高，农产品的商品率就愈大。而且，在这一进程中，农业劳动将逐步成为工业劳动的另一种形式。在农产品的价值中，工业劳动所占的比重将会提高。
    现阶段加强社会主义工业对农业的全面支援，在进一步巩固工农联盟方面，也具有极其重要的意义。
    社会主义胜利的根本保证——工农联盟，归根结底只有，第一，当巩固和加强了它的经济基础即生产关系的时候，第二，当克服了农民的旧的思想残余，用工人阶级的先进思想把他们武装起来的时候，才能得到巩固。
      为了用工人阶级思想改造农民的思想意识，在加强对他们的共产主义教育的同时，要推动农村技术革命，特别是农业机械化，进一步的发展农业生产力。加强工业对农业的支援，对于改造农民的思想意识，以便在新的基础上来巩固和发展工人阶级和农民的联盟，具有重要的意义。而当工人阶级和农民的联盟进一步巩固的时候，我国的社会主义、共产主义的建设就将会有一个新的高涨。
