    Learning from Ye Ming's Virtues of Diligence and Thrift
    Xiao Bai
    Promoting the style of hard work and plain living, practicing careful calculation, and managing the commune diligently and thriftily is Ye Ming's consistent style as the Party General Branch Secretary of the Qingfen Management District of the Dongfanghong People's Commune in Wuhan City. This General Branch Secretary, who conscientiously implements the Party's principles of building the country through diligence and thrift, running the commune through diligence and thrift, managing the household through diligence and thrift, and conducting all undertakings through diligence and thrift, not only leads a simple life herself, cherishes every needle and thread, shares weal and woe with the masses, but also promotes the further development of the style of diligence and thrift among the broad masses of cadres and people under her leadership.
    Ye Ming, this fifty-one-year-old Party General Branch Secretary who came from a family of housewives, deeply knows that every thread and strand is hard-earned, and also deeply understands that to build a socialist mansion, one must cherish every brick and tile. As the saying goes, "Always think of the days of no abundance when you have abundance, and don't wait until you have nothing to think of when you had something." Ye Ming is such a person who deeply knows how to live frugally. In leading and organizing the production and life of the commune's management district, she always takes the lead in diligent labor, leads everyone to engage in production with simple methods, practices careful calculation everywhere, pays attention to saving every bit and piece, and uses the saved things where they are needed more.
    Ye Ming's virtue of diligence and thrift may seem ordinary, but it is not something that everyone in some cadres and members of our urban people's communes has already achieved. With the rapid development of the national economic construction and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, some people see the People's Commune's family business gradually growing, and they feel that spending money can be more generous, and they always have to talk about ostentation when doing things. Some commune members, because their family income has increased, also do not pay attention to careful calculation and long-term planning in handling their lives. Compared with these manifestations of not paying attention to thrift, Comrade Ye Ming's consistently upholding the style of hard work and plain living is even more touching.
    The Chinese people are a people with a tradition of diligence and thrift. For many years, this has been a national virtue of ours. However, the current diligence and thrift are different from the past diligence and thrift. In the past, diligence and thrift were only for the sake of one's own family. Now, diligence and thrift are not only good for a family to better arrange their lives, but also to accelerate our country's great socialist construction. Our country is still a "poor and blank" country. If we want to completely change its face, we must implement the principle of diligence and thrift. From building the country to managing a household, we must do this. Otherwise, if we produce hard on the one hand and waste casually on the other, how can we continuously expand production and make our country rich and strong! As the saying goes, "Diligence is a money-making tree, and thrift is a treasure bowl." Only through diligence can we increase production more, and only through thrift can we save more. Therefore, today we should more firmly establish the idea of "taking diligence and thrift as glory, and taking extravagance and waste as shame" among cadres and commune members. Our commune cadres should learn from Ye Ming's virtues of diligence and thrift, learn from her long-term and consistent adherence to the style of hard work and plain living, and lead other cadres and the broad masses of commune members to establish a good style.

    学习叶明的勤俭美德
    萧柏
    发扬艰苦朴素的作风，精打细算，勤俭治理公社，这是武汉市东方红人民公社清芬管理区党总支书记叶明的一贯作风。这个认真贯彻党的勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家、勤俭办一切事业的总支书记，不但自己生活俭朴，爱惜一针一线，与群众同甘苦，而且在她的带动下，广大干部和群众也进一步发扬勤俭朴素的风尚。
    叶明，这个五十一岁的家庭妇女出身的党总支书记，深知一丝一缕来之不易，也深深地懂得要盖社会主义大厦，就得爱惜一砖一瓦。俗话说：“常将有日思无日，莫到无时思有时”。叶明就是这样深知勤俭生活的人。她在领导和组织公社管理区的生产和生活中，自己总是带头勤恳劳动，领导大家用穷办法搞生产，处处精打细算，点点滴滴都注意节约，把节约下来的东西用到更需要的地方去。
    叶明的这种勤俭美德，看来也许平凡，但是，在我们城市人民公社的一些干部和社员中，也并不是人人都已经作到的。随着国家经济建设的飞跃发展，人民生活水平的不断提高，有些人眼看着人民公社的家业逐渐大起来，就觉得花钱似乎可以大手大脚一些了，办什么事总得讲讲排场了。有的社员因为家庭收入增加了，在处理自己的生活方面，过日子也不注意精打细算，细水长流了。同这些不注意节俭的表现对比一下，叶明同志那种一贯坚持艰苦朴素的作风就更加令人感动了。
    中国人民是具有勤俭朴素传统的人民。多少年来，这已经是我们的一种民族美德。但是，现在的勤俭朴素和过去的勤俭朴素已经有了不同。从前，勤俭朴素只是为了一家一户。现在，勤俭朴素则不仅对一家一户更好地安排生活大有好处，而且是为了加速我们国家伟大的社会主义建设。我们的国家还是一个“一穷二白”的国家，要想彻底改变面貌，一定要执行勤俭的原则。大至建国，小至持家，都必须这样。不然的话，一方面辛辛苦苦的生产，一方面随随便便的浪费，这怎么能不断地扩大生产，使我们国家富强起来呢！俗话说：“勤是摇钱树，俭是聚宝盆”。只有勤，才能更多地增产，只有俭，才能更多地节约。所以，我们今天更应该在干部和社员中巩固地树立起“以勤俭朴素为荣，以奢侈浪费为耻”的思想。我们公社的干部，要学习叶明的勤劳节俭的美德，学习她长期一贯坚持发扬艰苦朴素的作风，带动起其它干部和广大社员树立起良好的风尚。
