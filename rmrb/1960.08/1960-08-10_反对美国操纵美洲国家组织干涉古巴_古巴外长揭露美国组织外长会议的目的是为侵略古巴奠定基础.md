    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 8th: Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa, in a televised speech yesterday, condemned the US for plotting the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' meeting in Costa Rica on August 16th, calling it a repeat of the Caracas meeting. He said that this meeting was organized to oppose the Cuban revolution, and its purpose was to lay the foundation for future aggression against Cuba.

    Roa condemned the Rio de Janeiro Treaty as a tool of US military policy. He said that the Cuban government would never allow the Rio de Janeiro Treaty to be implemented.

    Roa accused the US of adopting a position of power politics in its relations with Cuba. He reiterated that Cuba has not and will not participate in negotiations based on a position of strength. He said that negotiations can only be conducted on an equal footing. Roa also condemned the US for establishing a committee to protect some fugitive offenders against the Cuban government.

    Xinhua News Agency, August 9th, Washington: The Organization of American States Council, under US control, disregarded the opposition of the Cuban representative at a meeting held on the 8th and forcibly adopted the agenda for the Foreign Ministers' meeting formulated by the US for further interference in Cuba.

    Prior to this, Cuba had advocated including in the agenda of the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' meeting issues such as condemning US military and economic interference in Cuba, strengthening solidarity among Latin American countries, and considering US economic penetration and exploitation of Latin America, and expressed its firm opposition to the meeting discussing the so-called "communist threat."

    However, this Pan-American organization, under US control, still determined the following agenda for the meeting: "Strengthening the Inter-American system under the threat of interference from outside the continent"; "Maintaining the democratic system of the Americas" and "preventing subversion" in accordance with the charter of the Organization of American States; "Strengthening collective action to promote the improvement of living standards in underdeveloped areas of the Americas"; "Considering the international tensions existing in the Caribbean region," etc. These agendas clearly exposed the US's conspiracy to induce Latin American countries to support further US interference in Cuba. Strengthening the "Inter-American system" and "collective action" to oppose the so-called "threat of foreign interference," maintaining the so-called "democratic system," etc., are precisely the banners that the US has consistently used to interfere in Cuba.

    At the meeting on the 8th, Cuban Ambassador to the Organization of American States, Lechuga, reiterated Cuba's opposition to these agendas. He said that the Cuban government "does not see a threat from outside the continent endangering this hemisphere"; and that "the threat is from the United States, and the United States is responsible for the tensions in this hemisphere."

    US Ambassador Dreier vigorously denied US acts of aggression against Cuba at the meeting and insisted on determining the above-mentioned agenda for the Foreign Ministers' meeting that serves the US's conspiracy to interfere in Cuba.

    反对美国操纵美洲国家组织干涉古巴
    古巴外长揭露美国组织外长会议的目的是为侵略古巴奠定基础
    新华社哈瓦那8日电　古巴外长劳尔·罗亚在昨天发表的电视演说中，谴责美国策划于8月16日在哥斯达黎加举行的美洲国家组织外长会议是加拉加斯会议的翻版。他说，这次会议是为反对古巴革命而组织的，其目的是奠定以后侵略古巴的基础。
    罗亚谴责里约热内卢公约是美国军事政策的工具。他说，古巴政府决不让里约热内卢公约得以实施。
    罗亚指责美国在它同古巴的关系中所持的实力地位政策的态度。并且重申，古巴过去没有，将来也不会参加以实力地位为基础的谈判。他说，谈判只能在平等的基础上进行。罗亚还谴责美国成立了一个委员会来庇护反对古巴政府的一些逃亡犯。
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国控制下的美洲国家组织理事会在8日举行的会议上不顾古巴代表的反对，强行通过了美国为进一步干涉古巴而制订的外长会议的议程。
    在此以前，古巴曾经主张把谴责美国对古巴的军事和经济干涉、加强拉丁美洲国家之间的团结、考虑美国对拉丁美洲的经济渗透和剥削等问题，列入美洲国家外长会议议程，并且表示坚决反对这次会议讨论所谓“共产主义威胁”的问题。
    但是，在美国控制下的这个泛美机构仍然为这次会议确定了下列议程：在“受到大陆以外的干涉的威胁下加强泛美体系”，根据美洲国家组织的宪章来“维护美洲的民主制度”和“防止颠复活动”；“加强集体行动来促进美洲不发达地区生活水平的提高”；“考虑加勒比海地区存在的国际紧张局势”等。这些议程极其明显地暴露了美国诱迫拉丁美洲国家来支持美国进一步干涉古巴的阴谋。加强“泛美体系”和“集体行动”来反对所谓“外来干涉的威胁”、维护所谓“民主制度”等等，恰恰是美国为干涉古巴而一贯使用的招牌。
    在8日的会议上，古巴驻美洲国家组织的大使莱丘加重申古巴反对这些议程的立场。他说，古巴政府“没有看到来自大陆以外的危及本半球的威胁”；而“威胁是在美国方面，美国应对本半球的紧张局势负责”。
    美国大使德赖尔在会上极力抵赖美国对古巴的侵略行径，坚持要为外长会议确定上述为美国干涉古巴的阴谋服务的议程。
