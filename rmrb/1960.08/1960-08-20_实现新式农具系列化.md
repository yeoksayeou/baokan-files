　　Not long ago, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee held a provincial tool selection conference in Chongqing, gathering more than 4,000 pieces of advanced tools. From these, it selected more than 180 pieces and arranged them into complete sets of innovative tools for ten aspects: rice and wheat, cotton, sweet potatoes, sericulture, pig raising, indigenous chemical fertilizers and pesticides, transportation, agricultural product processing, cooking, and water lifting. Under the active leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, 57 counties across the province have now achieved the serialization of new-style tools in these ten aspects. Jiangxi Province selected complete sets of tools for field operations, animal husbandry, and agricultural product processing from more than 300 tools. Zhejiang Province made plans for the coordinated supply of new-style tools in ten aspects from the province down to the special districts and counties, requiring all counties in the province to implement them in a planned and step-by-step manner. These are all important measures to adapt to the new stage of the tool reform movement and should be greatly promoted.

　　Currently, all parts of the country are implementing the policy of "agriculture as the foundation of the national economy" and mobilizing large numbers of laborers to strengthen the agricultural production front. This is a decisive measure to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year. In order to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture and to better develop diversified operations, we should, while concentrating labor, vigorously grasp the reform of agricultural tools and develop this reform in the direction of serialization. Whether in farmland cultivation, farmland capital construction, animal husbandry, or collective welfare undertakings, we should create and adopt complete sets of advanced tools as much as possible and gradually.

　　In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, the movement for reforming agricultural tools in our country's rural areas has been flourishing and has achieved tremendous success. However, the development of this movement is still uneven. In many places, improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools have already reached a considerable proportion; in other places, improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools are still very few. In some places, the tool reform movement has already taken a big step towards the direction of serialization; in other places, this movement has not developed very quickly. In order to raise agricultural labor productivity more quickly and realize the continuous leap forward of agriculture, all regions should strengthen leadership over the tool reform movement and promote this movement to a higher level. We know that tool reform is mainly a single, partial reform, using efficient advanced tools to replace those backward old-style tools in some individual operation links. These advanced tools have played a significant role in improving labor efficiency. In the future, we should vigorously improve and continue to promote new-style farm tools that have already proven effective. Even if some new farm tools and tools are not yet in complete sets for the time being, as long as they can reduce heavy manual labor and significantly improve labor efficiency, they should be manufactured and promoted in large quantities. In the process of promotion, continue to develop and improve them so that they become serialized, that is, strive to comprehensively innovate the tools used in the entire production process. Because the various operation links of the entire production process are closely linked, when one process improves labor efficiency due to the presence of advanced tools, an imbalance will occur between it and other processes, which requires reforming the tools needed for other processes to overcome this imbalance. For example, after using rice transplanters, since the efficiency is many times higher than using manual transplanting, if the processes serving transplanting, such as field preparation, seedling pulling, seedling washing, seedling transportation, and seedling loading, still use backward tools and the old set of operating methods, they will not be able to meet the needs of rice transplanter operations. Such is the case with rice production, and the relationship between the various operation links of many other agricultural tasks is also the same. The imbalance in efficiency and operational specifications and quality between the various operation links often causes interruptions and idle work in the production process, making it impossible for advanced tools to fully exert their role. Therefore, in order to comprehensively and substantially improve the productivity of the entire agricultural labor force, it is necessary to have advanced tools that are largely coordinated with each other in all the various operation links of the entire production process as much as possible. Achieving the serialization of new farm tools is precisely to achieve this goal.

　　Achieving the serialization of new tools has even more far-reaching significance. The Party Central Committee has put forward to the people of the whole country the grand task of realizing agricultural mechanization nationwide in about ten years. Our country is a country with a vast territory, complex natural conditions and farming conditions, and at the same time a country with a large population and relatively little arable land. This basic situation determines the fundamental characteristics of agricultural mechanization in our country: it is necessary to greatly improve labor productivity, and also to combine all new-style tools and agricultural machinery with our country's fine tradition of intensive farming. Therefore, on the one hand, we must learn from the advanced experience of agricultural mechanization in foreign countries, and on the other hand, we must create a complete set of agricultural machinery suitable for our country's natural conditions and intensive farming requirements through mass tool reform movements. While giving full play to the enthusiasm of agricultural technical science departments and agricultural machinery manufacturing departments, launching a large-scale movement to reform production tools by mobilizing hundreds of millions of working peasants is the fundamental way to successfully achieve this task. Workers are most familiar with production tools, and local workers know best what kind of tools are needed locally. The broad masses of working people are not only experts in using tools, but also experts in reforming and creating tools. As long as the broad masses are mobilized and organized, and their enthusiasm and creativity are fully utilized, countless excellent new-style tools and agricultural machinery that can greatly improve labor productivity and meet the needs of local intensive farming will be created. Today, our efforts to achieve the serialization of improved tools and semi-mechanized tools are also laying the foundation for the future realization of agricultural mechanization.

　　The serialization of new-style tools should be carried out in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner. All localities should, according to the specific conditions of their regions, first grasp the tool reform of those agricultural tasks that consume the most labor and have the greatest labor intensity to achieve the serialization of new-style tools. Generally speaking, it is necessary to first grasp the reform and coordination of tools for summer harvesting and summer planting, and autumn harvesting and autumn planting, because the workload in these two aspects is the largest, the most labor is used, and the seasonality is also the strongest. By grasping these two key points, we can comprehensively reform according to the tools required for major crops and major operations, so that they gradually realize serialization. Wheat, rice, corn, etc., are our country's main food crops, and cotton, oil crops, and hemp are our country's main industrial raw material crops, so that these crops should have complete sets of new tools from all aspects of cultivation, planting, management, harvesting, and processing.

　　Now, the conditions for achieving the serialization of new-style tools have gradually matured. In recent years, many new types of tools have emerged in various places. As long as we strengthen leadership and seriously arrange the various existing new tools at home and abroad, and conduct evaluation and appraisal, we can realize the serialization of tools needed for many agricultural activities. Of course, some tools are not yet mature and need to be further improved; some aspects also have deficiencies and need to be researched and created. This does not matter, as long as we have a clear understanding of the situation and have a clear idea, we can mobilize the masses to attack weak links, and we can use our strength in the most necessary aspects to quickly strengthen weak links, mature immature tools, and create tools that are missing.

　　Achieving the serialization of advanced tools must be closely integrated with the current production needs, and must be ahead of the season and ahead of the needs. Only in this way can we more powerfully promote current production and more effectively promote the tool reform movement. For example, in summer, we should grasp the reform of tools for autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and autumn plowing, while in winter, we should grasp the reform of tools for spring plowing and spring planting, one season after another, one link after another, and make every effort to ensure meeting the needs of each season's production.

　　The cultivation and training of technical personnel is an important link in consolidating and expanding the achievements of tool reform and realizing the serialization of new tools. The creation of new tools requires a large number of skilled craftsmen who are enthusiastic about invention and creation, and the promotion of new tools requires more operators who are keen to accept new things. It can often be seen that the same new tool is used easily here, but it is idle there, or it is used once and then discarded. The key to this is often whether the technical training is good or not. Therefore, after manufacturing a large number of new tools, it is necessary to carefully train a large number of new tool operators, so that they not only know how to operate, but also how to repair; not only can they repair, but also can put forward suggestions for improving new tools based on their experience and understanding in use. This spring, Lushan County, Henan Province, combined with holding a "Advanced Machinery Exhibition, Evaluation, Finalization, and Matching Conference", held three technical training courses, adopting the method of technical innovation experts performing and technical personnel explaining the principles, and trained 2,400 technical backbones who understand the structural principles and operating methods of new tools, and also held mobile exhibitions and performances to conduct technical education to the broad masses, which vigorously promoted the reform of water conservancy, cultivation, pig raising, cooking, and agricultural and sideline product processing tools in the county. In two months, more than 80,000 pieces of matching advanced tools were promoted in these ten aspects. Many facts show that in all places that attach importance to technical training, a large number of advanced tools have taken root among the broad masses and have blossomed and borne fruit in production.

　　Strengthening the Party's leadership, seriously studying the problems in the tool reform movement, and helping the masses solve specific difficulties in their work are important guarantees for realizing the serialization of tool reform; timely adjustment of labor organization is also an important issue that the leadership should pay attention to. When the tools in each production process have been comprehensively reformed, the labor force using these tools must be reasonably allocated to adapt to the new operating conditions, and new organizational forms must be adopted. In this regard, we still lack mature experience, and we should carefully study and accumulate it in the process of realizing the serialization of new tools.

### 实现新式农具系列化

    实现新式农具系列化
    不久以前，四川省委在重庆召开了全省工具评选大会，集中了先进工具四千余件，从中评选出一百八十余件，配成了稻麦、棉花、红薯、蚕桑、养猪、土制化肥农药、运输、农产品加工和炊事、提水等十个方面成套的革新工具，在省委的积极领导下，现在全省已经有五十七个县实现了这十个方面的新式工具的系列化。江西省从三百多件工具中评选出田间作业、畜牧和农产品加工三方面的成套工具。浙江省从省到专区到县作了十个方面新式工具的配套规划，要求全省各县有计划有步骤地加以实现。这些都是适应工具改革运动新阶段的重要措施，应该大大推广。
    现在，全国各地执行“农业是国民经济的基础”的方针，调动大批劳动力加强农业生产战线。这是争取今年农业大丰收的一项具有决定意义的措施。为了实现农业大丰收，为了更好地发展多种经营，我们应当在集中劳动力的同时，大抓农业工具改革，使工具改革向系列化的方向发展。不论在农田耕作方面、农田基本建设方面、畜牧业方面，还是集体生活福利事业方面，都应该尽可能地、逐步地创制和采用整套的先进工具。
    几年来，特别是大跃进以来，我国农村工具改革运动一直在蓬勃发展着，取得了巨大的成就。但是，这个运动的发展还不平衡。许多地方，改良农具和半机械化农具已经达到相当大的比重；在另外一些地方，改良农具和半机械化农具还很少。有些地方的工具改革运动已经在向着系列化的方向前进了一大步；另一些地方，这个运动发展得很不快。为了更快地提高农业劳动生产率，实现农业的持续跃进，一切地区都应该加强对于工具改革运动的领导，推动这一运动向更高的水平前进。我们知道，工具改革主要是单项的、局部的改革，在一些个别的作业环节上用效率较高的先进工具去代替那些落后的旧式工具。这些先进工具在提高劳动效率方面起了显著的作用。今后我们应该大力改进和继续推广已经用之有效的新式农具。即使某些新的农具和工具暂时还不成套，但只要它们能够减轻笨重的手工劳动，能够显著地提高劳动效率，就应该大量制造和推广。在推广的过程中，继续发展提高，使其系列化，就是说，要争取整个生产过程所使用的工具全面革新。因为整个生产过程的各个作业环节是密切衔接的，当着一个工序由于有了先进工具而提高了劳动效率的时候，它与其他工序之间就会发生不平衡的现象，就需要改革其他工序所需要的工具，克服这种不平衡。例如，用水稻插秧机插秧以后，由于效率比用人工插秧提高了好多倍，如果为插秧服务的整田、拔秧、洗秧、运秧、装秧等工序，仍旧使用落后的工具和老一套的作业方法，就不能适应插秧机作业的需要了。水稻生产如此，其他很多农活的各个作业环节之间的关系也是如此。各个作业环节之间效率上和作业规格质量上的不平衡，往往会造成生产过程的中断和窝工现象，使得先进工具不能充分发挥作用。因此，要全面地、大幅度地提高整个农业劳动生产率，就必须尽可能使整个生产过程的各个作业环节都有大体上互相配合的先进工具。实现新农具的系列化，正是为了达到这个目的。
    实现新工具的系列化，还有更深远的意义。党中央已经向全国人民提出了十年左右的时间内全国实现农业机械化的宏伟任务。我国是一个幅员辽阔，自然条件和耕作条件复杂，同时又是人口众多、耕地较少的国家。这个基本情况就决定了我国农业机械化的根本特点：既要大大提高劳动生产率，又要使一切新式工具和农业机械同我国农业的精耕细作的优良传统相结合。因此，我们一方面要向外国学习农业机械化的先进经验，同时更要通过群众性的工具改革运动，创造出一整套适于我国自然条件和精耕细作要求的农业机械。在充分发挥农业技术科学部门和农业机械制造部门的积极性的同时，发动千百万劳动农民参加改革生产工具的大规模运动，则是胜利实现这一任务的根本途径。劳动者最熟悉生产工具，当地的劳动者最能清楚地知道当地需要什么样的工具。广大劳动人民不仅是使用工具的能手，也是革新和创造工具的能手。只要把广大群众动员起来，组织起来，充分发挥他们的积极性和创造性，就会有无数件优良的、既能大大提高劳动生产率、又适合当地精耕细作需要的新式工具和农业机械被创造出来。今天我们努力实现改良工具和半机械化工具系列化，也就是为将来实现农业机械化奠定基础。
    实现新式工具的系列化，应该有计划、有步骤、有重点地进行。各地应该根据本地区的具体情况，首先抓住那些占用劳动力最多和劳动强度最大的农活进行工具改革，实现新式工具系列化。一般说来要首先抓住夏收夏种、秋收秋种工具的改革和配套，因为这两个方面的农活工作量最大，劳动力用得最多，季节性也最强。抓住这两个重点，就可以按照主要作物和主要作业所需要的工具，全面地进行改革，使它们逐步实现系列化。小麦、水稻、玉米等是我国的主要粮食作物，棉花、油料、麻类是我国的主要工业原料作物，要使这些作物从耕、种、管、收、加工等各个环节都有成套的新工具。
    现在，实现新式工具系列化的条件已经逐步成熟了。几年来各地出现的新工具种类很多，只要加强领导，认真地把本地和外地现有的各种新工具排一排队，进行评比鉴定，就可以使许多农事活动所需要的工具实现系列化。当然，现在还有一些工具研究得还不成熟，有待于继续改进提高；某些方面也还有缺门，有待于研究创造。这也不要紧，只要我们情况摸清了，心中有数了，就可以发动群众突击薄弱环节，就可以把力量用在最必需的方面，很快地加强薄弱环节，使不成熟的工具成熟起来，把缺门的工具创造出来。
    实现先进工具系列化，要紧密结合当前生产需要来进行，并且要走在季节的前面，走在需要的前面。这样才能更有力地推动当前生产，更有效地推动工具改革运动。比如在夏季就应抓住秋收秋种秋耕等方面的工具进行改革，而冬季则抓住春耕春种等方面的工具进行改革，一季连一季，一环扣一环，全力保证满足各季生产需要。
    技术力量的培养训练，是巩固、扩大工具改革成果、实现新工具系列化的一个重要环节。创制新工具需要大批热心于发明创造的能工巧匠，推广新工具需要更多的敏于接受新事物的操作手。常常可以看到，同样一种新工具，在这里，人们用得得心应手；在那里，却闲置不用，或者用了一下又被丢在一边。所以如此，技术训练得好不好，往往是个关键。因此，在制造出大批新工具以后，一定要认真训练大批新工具手，使他们不仅会操作，而且会修理；不仅会修理，而且能够根据自己在使用中的经验和体会，提出改进新工具的意见。河南省鲁山县今春结合召开“先进机具展览、评选、定型、配套会议”，举办了三期技术训练班，采取技术革新能手表演、技术人员讲原理的办法，训练了两千四百名懂得新工具的构造原理和操作方法的技术骨干，还举办了流动展览、表演，向广大群众进行技术教育，有力地推广了全县水利、耕作、养猪、炊事、农副产品加工等工具的改革，两个月中间在这十个方面推广了配套先进工具八万多件。很多事实说明，凡是重视技术训练的地方，大量先进工具就在广大群众中扎下了根，在生产中开了花结了果。
    加强党的领导，认真研究工具改革运动中的问题，帮助群众解决工作中的具体困难，是实现工具改革系列化的重要保证；及时调整劳动组织，也是领导上应该注意的一个重要问题。当着各个生产过程中的工具实现了全面革新的时候，使用这些工具的劳动力必须适应新的作业条件加以合理分配，并且采取新的组织形式。在这方面我们还缺乏成熟的经验，应该在实现新工具系列化的过程中认真加以研究和积累。
