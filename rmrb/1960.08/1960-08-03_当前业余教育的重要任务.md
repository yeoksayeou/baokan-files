    At present, industrial and agricultural production continues to leap forward, the technological revolution is booming, and the people's communes in urban and rural areas are becoming increasingly consolidated. Under such an excellent situation, the national industrial and agricultural spare-time education and literacy campaign are also showing a new situation of great development, great improvement, adherence to regularity, and continuous revolution. Since the beginning of this year, a mass learning movement centered on studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong has emerged in various places, and a high tide of the whole party and the whole people running spare-time education and grasping literacy work has appeared. The ideological revolution, the technological revolution, and the cultural revolution are closely combined, promoting each other, and merging into a huge torrent, developing forward in ever-higher waves.
    In the vast countryside, since the mass learning movement was launched from last winter and this spring, more than 100 million farmers have enthusiastically participated in the learning, forming a nationwide, comprehensive, and sustained mass learning movement. This learning movement, which is huge in scale and long-lasting, is a remarkable thing compared to the ups and downs of the past. In order to meet the urgent needs of agricultural technology transformation, various professional technical schools have also been established to rapidly cultivate technical forces. In factories, the development of the technological revolution movement has greatly promoted the development and improvement of workers' spare-time education. Workers' spare-time education directly serves the technological revolution movement and promotes mass scientific research work. At present, the number of workers in factories and mines participating in learning nationwide has reached 25 million. Among the workers, the literacy work is nearing completion, the popularization of spare-time elementary education is being vigorously carried out, and workers' spare-time secondary education is also developing rapidly. It is particularly worth mentioning that the number of people studying in spare-time universities is more than 400,000. In provinces where workers' spare-time education has developed rapidly, the number of students in spare-time universities has exceeded that of full-time university students. This year, several thousand workers will graduate from spare-time universities, which is a new force in building socialism. From January to April this year, a total of more than 30 million young and middle-aged illiterates were eliminated in rural areas and factories and enterprises across the country, which is more than the total number of illiterates eliminated in the entire year of last year. Since the central government issued instructions to vigorously promote the phonetic literacy experience of Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, and put forward the call to accelerate literacy, literacy work has greatly developed nationwide. Phonetic literacy not only solves the problem of relapse after literacy, but also helps students who have become literate to learn on their own without a teacher and continuously increase the number of characters they know through self-study. In terms of school-running forms, from factories and mines running schools, communes and production teams running schools, it has further developed to workshops running schools, offices running schools, and high-yield fields running schools, truly achieving where there is production, there is learning, making spare-time education closely combined with the "two revolutions" and "four modernizations." In short, in the past six months, industrial and agricultural spare-time education has greatly developed and improved both in quantity and quality.
    In order to better develop and consolidate the achievements already made, and to better realize the continued leap forward in the work in the second half of this year, we must continue to implement the policy of "consolidating, persisting, improving quality, and continuing to develop" in spare-time education. According to this policy, the important tasks of current spare-time education are: to vigorously grasp literacy and spare-time elementary education, actively carry out teaching reform in spare-time education, and at the same time, pay attention to consolidating and improving and continuing to develop spare-time secondary and higher education. If these tasks are done well, our spare-time education work will develop faster.
    In terms of literacy work, the central government has proposed to basically complete the task of eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people across the country in two or three years. This is a great political task, and we must ensure its successful completion and strive to achieve it ahead of schedule. Literacy is the starting point for the intellectualization of workers and peasants. For the sake of socialist construction and for the benefit of the working people, we must conscientiously undertake this task and grasp it firmly and carefully. The current literacy campaign is completely different from the situation eleven years ago. Eleven years ago, illiterates accounted for more than 80% of the country's population. Now, the number of illiterates has been greatly reduced. This change in the basic situation will surely accelerate the process of our literacy work and complete this glorious task in a relatively short period of time. We must not be blindly optimistic and relaxed because the literacy achievements have already been great. We should ideologically recognize that the task of eliminating illiteracy is extremely arduous. Turning illiterates into non-illiterates is not an easy task. Especially the remaining illiterates generally have some special difficulties, so this work must be done in a down-to-earth and meticulous manner. In terms of specific measures, on the one hand, we must conscientiously do a good job in surveying illiterates, so that we are fully aware of the situation. According to the literacy experience of some areas, some relapses and omissions are inevitable in the literacy movement, and repeated investigation is needed. At present, the literacy work in some areas has entered the final stage. And checking for omissions is a very important issue in the final stage. A city, a factory, a commune, after repeated checks, found some illiterates who had been missed. It should be said that this is not a bad thing, but a good thing. The sooner it is found, the sooner it can be eliminated. The more timely the checking for omissions, the earlier the literacy work can be completed successfully. On the other hand, we must resolutely implement the central government's instructions on promoting phonetic literacy, immediately start to do all the preparatory work, so as to carry out the phonetic literacy movement on a large scale after autumn, and actively carry out literacy. Phonetic literacy has found us a shortcut to rapid literacy. The quality of this work has a great impact on the completion of the literacy task. In order to better consolidate the results of literacy and prevent relapse and return to illiteracy, while the literacy task is being completed, we must vigorously develop spare-time elementary education, so that people who should be enrolled and who can enter spare-time elementary schools after becoming literate, enroll as much as possible, so that literacy and spare-time elementary education are closely linked and completed in one go.
    While vigorously grasping literacy and spare-time elementary education, spare-time schools at all levels must also actively carry out teaching reform. Under the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the in-depth development of technological innovation and technological revolution, we must further closely combine with the current technological innovation and technological revolution movement, conduct in-depth and extensive teaching reform, and deepen the education revolution into the teaching field of spare-time education. The teaching reform of spare-time education, like the teaching reform of ordinary education, is a class struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, and a profound ideological revolution. We must first strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, and take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide. At the same time, we must proceed from reality and formulate teaching plans that can meet the needs of the country and can cultivate talents in a faster, better, and more economical way. We should resolutely change the set of education systems in spare-time education that rigidly copy full-time ordinary education, as well as the shortcomings of neglecting politics, being divorced from production, being divorced from reality, not being suitable for the characteristics of adults, having excessively long school years, and not meeting the needs of the country. We must comprehensively implement the Party's education policy of serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor, so that the teaching content adapts to the needs of all walks of life, different units, different objects, and different situations, and adapts to the needs of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and pay special attention to increasing modern new scientific knowledge. We must conscientiously implement the principle of "combining with production, unified arrangement, teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, and flexibility and diversity" put forward by the Central Committee for spare-time education, so that spare-time education is more closely combined with production and arranged more properly. In spare-time education, we must attach great importance to organizing the broad masses of workers and peasants to study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong and master the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought. This is not only the soul of teaching work, but also the soul of the entire spare-time education work.
    Although some teaching reforms in spare-time education have been carried out in the past, it is still a new task and lacks experience. Therefore, in the process of reform, on the one hand, we must mobilize the masses to boldly innovate and create experience, and on the other hand, we must conduct serious investigations and repeated studies, and proceed step by step after all experiments. At present, many areas have created many good reform experiences and formulated various reform plans. Although these reform experiences are not yet mature, all new things are always not very mature at the beginning. Therefore, don't be afraid of immaturity, let go of experimentation, so that various reform plans can bloom, and then through full exchange of experience, mutual learning and mutual supplementation, a more mature reform plan will gradually emerge.
   Our reforms should not only pay attention to speed, but also pay attention to quality. It is necessary to clearly define the purpose of carrying out teaching reforms, which is to improve teaching quality and comprehensively cultivate talents in a faster, better, and more economical way. Our teaching reform must not only meet the needs of the current national construction, but also have a long-term goal. Our long-term goal is to cultivate technical talents who are both red and expert in a faster, better, and more economical way, to popularize higher education among workers and peasants, and to train our workers and peasants into laborers who have both a high degree of communist consciousness and modern cultural and scientific knowledge, and who can engage in both physical and mental labor, so as to gradually eliminate the difference between physical and mental labor and create the necessary conditions for gradually transitioning to communism.
    The whole people running spare-time education is an innovation of our Party and Chairman Mao. People who have lost the opportunity of education in the past will be compensated in the current great era. This work is of great significance. We must resolutely run spare-time education well, so that we can, as Chairman Mao said: appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture.

    当前业余教育的重要任务
    当前工农业生产持续跃进，技术革命蓬勃发展，城乡人民公社日益巩固，在这样大好形势下，全国工农业余教育和扫盲工作也呈现出大发展、大提高、坚持经常、不断革命的新局面。今年以来，各地出现了以学习毛泽东同志的著作为中心的群众性的学习运动，出现了全党全民大办业余教育、大抓扫盲工作的高潮。思想革命、技术革命和文化革命紧密地结合在一起，互相推动，互相促进，汇成一股巨大的洪流，一浪高过一浪地向前发展。
    广大农村，从去冬今春开始掀起群众学习运动以来，一亿以上的农民热烈地参加了学习，形成一次全民的、全面的、持久的群众学习运动。这种规模巨大，长期坚持的学习运动，和过去那种大起大落的状况相比，是一件了不起的事情。为了适应农业技术改造的迫切需要，还举办了各种专业技术学校，迅速培养技术力量。在工厂，由于技术革命运动的开展，大大促进了职工业余教育的发展和提高。职工业余教育直接为技术革命运动服务，又推动了群众性的科学研究工作。目前，全国厂矿企业职工参加学习的人数已达二千五百万人，在职工中，扫盲工作已经接近扫尾阶段，普及业余初等教育的工作正大力开展，职工业余中等教育也发展的很快。特别值得提出的是，在业余大专学校学习的人数就有四十多万人，职工业余教育发展的省份，业余大专学校学生的数量已经超过了全日制大学的学生。今年将有几千职工从业余大专学校毕业，这是建设社会主义的一支新生力量。今年1至4月份，全国农村和工厂企业共扫除青壮年文盲三千多万人，比去年全年扫除的文盲还多。自从中央发出了大力推广山西万荣县注音识字扫盲经验的指示，提出了加速扫盲的号召后，扫盲工作在全国有了很大的发展。注音识字不仅解决了扫盲后的回生现象，并且帮助扫盲后学员无师自通，利用自学不断增加识字的数量。在办学形式上，从厂矿办学、公社与生产队办学，进一步发展到车间办学、科室办学、丰产方办学，真正作到在哪里生产，就在哪里学习，使业余教育紧紧地和“双革”“四化”结合起来了。总之，半年来，工农业余教育不论在数量上和质量上都有了很大的发展和提高。
    为了更好地发展和巩固已取得的成绩，更好地实现今年下半年工作的继续跃进，在业余教育工作中要继续贯彻执行“巩固起来，坚持下去，提高质量，继续发展”的方针。根据这个方针，当前业余教育的重要任务是：大抓扫盲和业余初等教育，积极进行业余教育的教学改革，同时，还要注意巩固提高和继续发展业余中等教育和高等教育。这几项工作作好了，我们的业余教育工作就会更快地向前发展。
    在扫盲工作方面，中央提出的要在两三年内在全国青壮年中基本上完成扫除文盲的任务，这是个伟大的政治任务，我们一定要保证胜利完成，并且力争提前实现。扫盲是工农群众知识化的起点，为了社会主义建设，为了劳动人民的利益，我们必须认真地把这一工作担当起来，狠抓，细抓。现在进行扫盲和十一年前的情况完全不同。十一年前，全国文盲占80％以上，现在，文盲已经减少很多。这个基本情况的变化，一定会加快我们扫盲工作的进程，在较短的时间内完成这个光荣的任务。我们决不能因为扫盲成绩已经很大，而产生盲目乐观和麻痹松劲的思想。应该从思想上认清扫除文盲的任务是异常艰巨的。把文盲变为非文盲不是一件容易的事。特别是最后剩下的文盲，一般都有一些特殊困难，因此这项工作必须踏实地细致地来作，在具体措施上，一方面要切切实实地作好文盲摸底工作，作到心中有数。根据一些地区扫盲经验来看，扫盲运动中难免有些复盲、漏盲现象，需要反复清查。目前有的地区扫盲工作已经进入扫尾阶段。而查漏，是扫尾阶段很重要的问题。一个城市、一个工厂、一个公社，经过反复查漏，查出一些漏扫的文盲，应该说，这不是坏事，而是一件好事。早查出一天，就可以早扫除一天，查漏越及时，扫盲工作就越是可以提前顺利完成任务。另外一方面，要坚决贯彻执行中央关于推广注音识字的指示，立即着手作好一切准备工作，以便秋后大规模地开展注音识字运动，积极进行扫盲。注音识字扫盲，为我们找到了一条快速扫盲的捷径。这项工作作的好与不好，对完成扫盲任务有很大影响。为了更好地巩固扫盲成果，防止复盲、回生，在扫盲任务完成的同时，要大力发展业余初等教育，使脱盲后应当入学而又可能进入业余初等学校的人，尽可能地入学，作到扫完一批升学一批，使扫盲和业余初等教育紧密衔接起来，一气呵成。
    在大抓扫盲和业余初等教育的同时，各级业余学校还要积极进行教学改革。在工农业生产大跃进，技术革新和技术革命深入发展的新形势下，我们要进一步紧密地结合当前的技术革新和技术革命运动，深入广泛地进行教学改革，把教育革命深入到业余教育的教学领域中去。业余教育的教学改革，和普通教育的教学改革一样，是一场兴无灭资的阶级斗争，是一场深刻的思想革命，必须首先加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，以毛泽东思想为指导。同时，要从实际出发，制定出能够适应国家需要，能够多快好省地培养人材的教学方案来。应当坚决改变业余教育中硬搬全日制普通教育的一套教育制度，以及忽视政治、脱离生产、脱离实际、不适合成年人的特点、学制过长、不符合国家的需要等等缺点。必须全面地贯彻执行党的教育为工人阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，使教学内容适应各行各业、不同单位、不同对象、不同情况下的需要，适应社会主义革命和社会主义建设的需要，特别注意增加现代的新的科学知识。要认真贯彻中央对业余教育提出的“结合生产，统一安排，因材施教，灵活多样”的原则，使业余教育和生产结合得更加紧密，安排得更加妥善。在业余教育中，必须十分重视组织广大工农群众学习毛泽东同志的著作、掌握毛泽东思想武器。这不仅是教学工作的灵魂，而且是整个业余教育工作的灵魂。
    业余教育的教学改革，虽然过去作过一些，但毕竟是一项新的工作，还缺乏经验，因此在改革过程中，一方面要发动群众大胆革新，创造经验，一方面要认真调查，反复研究，一切经过试验，踏踏实实地进行。目前许多地区都已创造了不少很好的改革经验，制订出各种改革的方案。这些改革的经验虽然还不成熟，但一切新生的事物，开始总是不很成熟的。因此，不要怕不成熟，要放手试验，使各种改革方案百花齐放，然后经过充分交流经验，互相学习、互相补充，这样才会逐渐产生比较成熟的改革方案来。
  我们的改革不只要注意快，而且要注意质量。一定要明确进行教学改革的目的，是为了提高教学质量，多快好省地全面培养人材。我们的教学改革，既要符合当前国家建设的需要，又要有一个远大的目标。我们的长远目标，就是要多快好省地培养又红又专的技术人材，要在工农中普及高等教育，把我国的工农培养成为既有高度的共产主义觉悟，又有现代的文化科学知识，既能从事体力劳动，又能从事脑力劳动的劳动者，为逐步消灭体力劳动与脑力劳动的差别，逐步向共产主义过渡创造必要的条件。
    全民大办业余教育，这是我们党和毛主席的一个创举。过去失掉教育机会的人，都会在现在伟大的时代中得到补偿。这项工作具有伟大的意义。我们一定要坚决把业余教育办好，从而能像毛主席说的那样：要以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。
