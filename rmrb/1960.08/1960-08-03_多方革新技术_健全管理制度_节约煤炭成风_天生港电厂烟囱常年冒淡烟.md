    Multifaceted Technological Innovation, Sound Management System, Saving Coal Becomes a Habit
    Tienshenkang Power Plant Chimney Constantly Emits Light Smoke
    (Our newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch) The workers and staff of the Tienshenkang Power Plant in Nantong, Jiangsu Province, have firmly established the idea of "cherishing coal as we cherish grain, saving every bit." They have persisted in saving coal for years, continuously innovating technology, reducing coal consumption, and achieving the goal of using less coal and generating more electricity. Compared with the past, this plant has saved more than 30,000 tons of coal in the past four years.
    Arriving at Tienshenkang, one can immediately discover the plant's outstanding achievements in saving coal. From a distance, no smoke can be seen from the plant's chimney; even when approaching, only some silvery-white light smoke is visible. Since the plant began to focus on saving coal in the first quarter of 1957, coal consumption has gradually decreased. In that year, the average coal consumption dropped to 0.507 kilograms, making it an advanced unit with the lowest coal consumption in the provincial power system. Since the beginning of this year, in order to further save bituminous coal and support the leap forward of the iron and steel industry, the workers have also used anthracite coal with low ignition point for power generation, with the blending ratio reaching 80%, and the coal consumption is still lower than the average level of power plants in the province.
    The reason why this plant has made outstanding achievements in saving coal is the result of the firm establishment of the concept of "cherishing coal as we cherish grain" by all the workers and staff under the leadership of the Party. Over the past few years, the plant's Party committee has frequently conducted ideological education for all workers and staff on saving coal and supporting national construction through various means. They also helped workers understand the relationship between the operation of each position and the amount of coal consumption through detailed accounting, so that everyone clearly recognized the relationship between the quality of their work and saving. The Party Secretary, the Plant Director, and the Chief Engineer also frequently went to the furnace front to fire with the workers, taking the lead in studying ways to save coal. Each department insisted on making reducing coal consumption a content of the competition, so that the entire plant formed a good atmosphere in which everyone saved coal and everyone cared about coal consumption. The chimney that emitted smoke became the center of attention for the entire plant, from top to bottom. As soon as they saw the chimney emitting black smoke, everyone would study countermeasures together. Hu Zhaoyin, an old coal transport worker, would pick up even a piece of coal scattered on the ground and put it back on the coal pile. When the weather was dry and windy, he always sprinkled a layer of water on the coal pile to prevent coal dust from being blown away by the wind, year after year.
    With the deepening of the concept of "cherishing coal as we cherish grain," the workers have continuously strived to improve equipment and operating techniques, achieving a series of technical innovations to ensure high equipment efficiency and no leakage of waste gas and residual heat, giving full play to the thermal efficiency of coal. The important innovation projects for saving coal in the boiler area alone include more than 50 items such as economizers and coal retaining plates. The economizer alone can save 10 grams of coal per kilowatt-hour. The boiler, turbine and other parts have created a new set of operating techniques, and the most economical standards have been found for different types of coal in terms of the level of wind pressure, the thickness of the coal seam, and the length of the fire bed.
    Under the slogan of "eat whatever we have," the workers mixed coal slag, coke fines, and even rice husks to burn the boiler. Since mid-March of this year, after more than a dozen experiments, the workers have further utilized anthracite coal in large quantities to burn boilers, saving more than 8,000 tons of bituminous coal per month, which has strongly supported the leap forward of the iron and steel industry.
  Strengthening management and establishing a system for saving coal is also an important experience for the continuous decline in the plant's coal consumption. They have established systems for coal yard management, coal type analysis, mixing standards, ash sample analysis, coal consumption publication, regular analysis, and important instrument inspection and calibration. From the time the coal enters the plant to the time the electricity is generated, every link is closely connected. These management measures have greatly promoted the continuous reduction of coal consumption.

    多方革新技术　健全管理制度　节约煤炭成风
    天生港电厂烟囱常年冒淡烟
    本报南京2日电　江苏省南通天生港电厂职工人人确立“爱煤如爱粮，点滴都节约”的思想，几年如一日地坚持节约用煤，不断革新技术，降低煤耗，做到了少用煤、多发电。这个厂近四年来的发电煤耗和过去比较，节约煤炭达三万多吨。
    一到天生港，人们就可以发现这个厂节约用煤的出色成就。远远看去，在这个厂烟囱上看不到烟；走近看，也只见到飘一些银白色的淡烟。这个厂从1957年第一季度狠抓节约用煤起，煤耗量就逐渐下降，那年平均煤耗降到零点五零七公斤，成为全省电业系统中煤耗量最低的先进单位。今年以来，为了进一步节约烟煤，支援钢铁工业跃进，职工们又利用发火低的白煤发电，掺用量达到了80％，煤耗量仍然低于全省电厂的平均水平。
    这个厂所以能够在节约用煤上做出出色的成绩，是全厂职工在党的教导下树立了坚强的“爱煤如爱粮”的观念的结果。几年来，厂党委经常通过各种方式向全厂职工进行节约用煤、支援国家建设的思想教育。他们还通过算细账的方式，帮助工人了解各个岗位操作对煤耗大小的关系，使大家明确认识自己工作的好坏和节约的关系。党委书记、厂长和总工程师，也经常到炉前和工人一起烧火，带头研究节约用煤的门路，各个部门都坚持将降低煤耗做为竞赛内容，使全厂形成了人人节约用煤、个个关心煤耗的良好风气。出烟的烟囱，成为全厂上上下下注意的中心。一看到烟囱冒黑烟，大家就要一起研究对策。运煤老工人胡兆银，平时看到散落在地上的一块煤都要拾起来，放到煤堆上去；当天气干燥有风的时候，他总要到煤堆上去洒一层水，不使煤屑被风吹掉，几年如一日。
    随着“爱煤如爱粮”观念的深入人心，职工们在改进设备和操作技术方面不断努力，实现了一系列的技术革新，做到设备效率高、废气余热不漏，充分发挥了煤炭应有的热效率。仅是锅炉方面节约用煤的重要革新项目，就有省煤器、挡煤板等五十多项。其中省煤器一项，就可使每度电节约用煤十克。锅炉、汽机等部分都创造了一套新的操作技术，针对不同的煤种，从风压的高低、煤层的厚薄、火床的长短等方面都找到了最为节约的标准。
    职工们在“有什么‘吃’什么”的口号下，掺用煤渣、焦屑，甚至掺用砻糠来烧锅炉。今年3月中旬以来，职工们又经过十多次试验，进一步大量利用白煤烧锅炉，每个月就可节约烟煤八千多吨，有力地支援了钢铁工业的跃进。
  加强管理工作，建立节约用煤的制度，这也是这个厂煤耗不断下降的一条重要经验。他们建立了煤场管理、煤种化验分析、掺和标准、灰样化验、煤耗公布、定期分析、重要仪表检查校对等制度，从煤炭进厂到发出电力的整个过程中，环环扣紧，一环不松。这些管理上的措施，都大大促进了煤耗量的不断降低。
