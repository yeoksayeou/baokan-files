　　Rice Paddy Intercropping with Carrots Saves Labor and Increases Yield
　　Chongxing Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan, Sums Up Advanced Experience and Vigorously Intercrops Carrots by Changing Farming Methods
　　(Our Report) The members of the Chongxing People's Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, are seizing the great opportunity to fully utilize the advanced experience of intercropping carrots in rice paddies, which they have accumulated over the past few years, and are vigorously planting carrots.

　　In the West Sichuan Plain, the general practice in the past was to plant carrots in dry land and cultivated fields (fields plowed after the rice harvest). After the Chongxing People's Commune summarized and promoted the advanced experience of planting carrots in rice paddies (fields that have not been plowed), they achieved high yields over large areas. In 1959, the commune planted 2,300 mu of carrots in rice paddies, with an average yield of 3,150 jin per mu, and the highest reaching 6,000 jin, more than double the local average yield, while saving 10 workdays per mu.

　　Due to the large-scale bumper harvest of late autumn crops, especially carrots, last year, the members of this commune have had very good living arrangements. This year, the commune's spring grain has already been arranged until the end of August. Carrots are delicious and nutritious, and the public canteens use carrots to make more than ten kinds of dishes, which the members eat with great satisfaction. Some canteens still have dried carrots stored for consumption during the off-vegetable season. With the high yield of carrots, the source of pig feed has also increased. Carrot leaves are a very good pig feed. Calculating only 2,000 jin of carrot leaves harvested per mu, which can be dried into 200 jin of dried feed, is enough for one pig to eat for 100 days. In addition, the commune also sold more than 300,000 jin of carrots last year to support cities and factories, increasing cash income.

　　The most fundamental reason why the carrots planted by the Chongxing People's Commune can achieve high yields over large areas is that the commune's Party committee grasped the work early, accurately, and firmly, vigorously supported new things, and resolutely promoted advanced experience. As early as 1958, shortly after the commune was established, the Party committee discovered that commune member Xu Shouyi had gained high yields by intercropping carrots in rice paddies. In order to vigorously develop vegetable production and better arrange the lives of the members, the commune's Party committee decided to use rice paddy intercropping with carrots as a major measure to increase production, and at the same time carried out a series of ideological and organizational work to summarize and promote this advanced experience. In 1959, a total of 12% of the commune's cultivated land was planted with carrots.

　　Sowing carrots in rice paddies can advance the sowing period, extend the growing period, and facilitate the accumulation of nutrients; at the same time, the late autumn climate is suitable for carrot growth, and the emergence of seedlings is uniform; as long as they are carefully managed, high yields can be achieved.

　　The living facts have educated those who do not believe that carrots can be grown in rice paddies. Now, as soon as someone mentions carrots, the members of the Chongxing Commune will enthusiastically tell you the benefits of planting carrots in rice paddies on a large scale. Therefore, this year, after the Party committee issued a call to vigorously plant late autumn crops, the members are determined to further expand the planting area of carrots. As of August 13, the commune has planted 700 mu of carrots in rice paddies.

    水稻板田套种胡萝卜省工又高产
    四川郫县崇兴公社总结先进经验，改变耕作方法，大力套种胡萝卜
    本报讯　四川省郫县崇兴人民公社的社员们正抓紧大好时机，充分运用几年来利用水稻板田套种胡萝卜的先进经验，大种胡萝卜。
    在川西平原上，过去一般习惯都是在旱地和耖田（水稻收割后翻过的田）种胡萝卜。崇兴人民公社总结推广了用水稻板田（没有翻过的田）种胡萝卜的先进经验后，获得了大面积高产。1959年全社用水稻板田种植胡萝卜二千三百亩，平均亩产三千一百五十斤，最高的达到六千斤，比当地一般产量提高一倍以上，每亩地还节约十个工。
    这个公社由于去年晚秋作物、特别是胡萝卜的大面积丰收，社员的生活安排得很好，今年全社小春粮食已安排到8月底。胡萝卜既好吃，营养又丰富，公共食堂用胡萝卜作出十多种菜，社员们吃得非常满意。有的食堂至今还贮存有胡萝卜干，供蔬菜淡季食用。随着胡萝卜的高产，还增加了猪饲料的来源。胡萝卜缨是一种很好的猪饲料。仅以每亩收胡萝卜缨二千斤，晒成干饲料二百斤计算，就足够一头猪吃一百天。此外，这个公社去年还出售了三十多万斤胡萝卜支援城市和工厂，增加了现金收入。
    崇兴人民公社种的胡萝卜所以能获得大面积高产，最根本的原因，是公社党委抓得早、抓得准、抓得狠，大力支持新生事物，坚决推广先进经验的结果。早在1958年，公社成立不久，党委就发现社员徐守益用水稻板田套种胡萝卜获得高产的经验。为了大力发展蔬菜生产，把社员生活安排得更好，公社党委决定把用稻田套种胡萝卜作为增产的一项重大措施，同时进行了一系列的思想工作和组织工作，总结和推广了这个先进经验。1959年全社共有12％的耕地种植了胡萝卜。
    用水稻板田播种胡萝卜，可以提早播种期，延长生长期，有利于营养物质的积累；同时，晚秋的气候适宜于胡萝卜生长，出苗整齐；只要认真管理，就能高产。
    活生生的事实教育了那些不相信板田能种胡萝卜的人。现在，只要有人一提到胡萝卜，崇兴公社的社员们都会兴致勃勃地告诉你利用板田大种胡萝卜的好处。所以，今年当党委发出了大种晚秋作物的号召以后，社员们决心进一步扩大胡萝卜的种植面积。到8月13日止，全社已用水稻板田种胡萝卜七百亩。
