Tool reform should start early and accurately, selecting samples for standardization, and forming complete sets.

Jiao Dexiu
First Secretary of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hubei

Xiangyang Prefecture has achieved increased production for consecutive years, and tool reform has played an important role in this. This year, the area of summer harvest crops in the region has expanded by about 25% compared to last year, the area of summer planting has expanded by more than 20%, and summer grain storage has increased by more than 200 million catties compared to last summer. The workload of harvesting, threshing, transportation, and planting has greatly increased. However, the labor force participating in summer harvest and planting has not increased. On the contrary, some labor force is engaged in water conservancy and other construction. Under these circumstances, summer harvest and planting were completed earlier than last year, and summer grain storage was completed 25 days earlier than last year. One of the main reasons is the vigorous mass movement of tool reform centered on "four reforms and two eliminations" and agricultural semi-mechanization, which improved work efficiency. (Four reforms and two eliminations refer to changing human-powered water lifting to gravity irrigation, changing shoulder carrying to transportation by vehicles and boats and slipways, changing backward farming tools to improved tools, and changing manual processing to mechanized and semi-mechanized processing, to eliminate shoulder carrying and human-powered water lifting.) In the past few years, we have realized that the mass movement of tool reform centered on "four reforms and two eliminations" and agricultural semi-mechanization is the main way to solve the contradiction of insufficient labor force in continuous agricultural production increase, and it is also a necessary stage to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture. In the past few years, we have mainly focused on the following points in tool reform: starting early and accurately, selecting samples for standardization, forming complete sets, and using and managing them well.

(I)

Agricultural production has a strong seasonality, so tool reform must start early to prepare, grasp the next season in the current season, see the next year from the current year, and stay ahead of the agricultural season, so that the tools are ready for the season, and the season does not wait for the tools. If the action is late, even if the reformed tools are more and better, they cannot play their due role in the current season. We start preparing for spring plowing tools in the winter of the previous year, and for summer harvest and planting and field management tools in the spring, and for autumn harvest and winter planting tools in the summer. Since the spring, we have focused on the tool reform of short-distance transportation, harvesting, threshing, processing, and cooking, and carried out vigorous mass movements. Before the summer harvest, the region had more than 520,000 human and animal-powered carts, an average of one cart for every four laborers; more than 78,000 hydraulic and animal-powered processing points were built, an average of 1.5 points per production team. In addition, more than 200,000 pieces of new and improved agricultural tools such as rice transplanters, harvesters, sickle knives, threshers, and improved stone rollers have been promoted. These tools were put into summer harvest and planting, and it is estimated that they saved two to three million labor days and four to five hundred thousand animal labor days.

While starting early, we must also grasp accurately. The so-called grasping accurately means grasping the key measures for agricultural production increase, so that the tools are adapted to the key measures. For example, the key measures for increasing wheat production next year are to open up wasteland to expand the area and deep plowing, so we must grasp the reform of wasteland opening and deep plowing tools. This is one aspect. On the other hand, we must also grasp the weak links that consume the most labor and have strong seasonality. For example, the threshing and transportation workload in summer harvest is the largest, and the time is very tight. It is not enough to rely solely on flail threshing and shoulder carrying, so we must grasp the reform of threshing and transportation tools. This means that we must also be good at grasping the main contradictions in tool reform. Xiangyang Prefecture is a region with two crops of rice and wheat and two crops of cotton and wheat. Summer is not only for harvesting but also for planting, which is a key season with decisive significance for the annual production increase and also the most labor-intensive season. Based on this feature, we focus on the tool reform of summer harvest and planting throughout the year. However, there are many tools needed for summer harvest and planting, including tools for harvesting, threshing, transportation, processing, land preparation, and sowing. We must also distinguish between primary and secondary aspects in these aspects. This year, we have concentrated our efforts on grasping the tool reform of short-distance transportation, threshing, and processing, which occupy the most labor and have the longest use time. Currently, we are vigorously grasping the tool reform of winter planting, and we have determined that the reform of deep plowing and strip sowing tools is the main direction of attack. It is better to adopt the method of tackling key problems in a campaign to carry out tool reform than to do it piecemeal, and significant results can be achieved in a short period of time.

(II)

In the mass movement of tool reform, inventions and creations emerge in endlessly. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen leadership, do a good job in selecting samples for standardization in a timely manner, and promote them in a guided, planned, and organized manner. Selecting samples for standardization is the key to ensuring the vigorous, solid, and healthy development of the mass movement of tool reform. We have determined that all tools that are to be widely promoted throughout the region, such as the seven-net fourteen-width wooden wheel cart in Sui County, the water-powered processing production line in Yunxi, the improved plow in Nanzhang, and the Pang-style three-row automatic seed strip seeder in Xiangfan City, are all under the command of the secretary, with the entire Party mobilizing, and after repeated trials and selection of samples for standardization. From the continuous increase in wheat production, we have found that the three-row automatic seed strip seeder created by the Pang Gong commune is a very good strip sowing tool, which can automatically sow seeds and sow seeds evenly. When the prefectural committee studied the preparations for winter planting, it decided to improve on the basis of the Pang-style three-row automatic seed strip seeder and produce a standardized strip seeder for promotion throughout the region. In early June, I took Jin Fengshan, a tool reform expert from the Xiangyang Prefectural General Machinery Factory, to the Pang Gong commune, and discussed this issue with the workers and members of the commune's farm tool factory, and put forward several points that needed to be improved, and organized workers from several factories, including the Xiangyang Prefectural General Machinery Factory, to participate in the reform. After the reform was successful, this three-row automatic seed strip seeder was used to plant a piece of wheat in the Pang Gong brigade, and the seeds were sown evenly and the row spacing was appropriate. At the county party committee first secretary meeting, the first secretaries of each county went to the site for evaluation and appraisal, and believed that this strip seeder has the advantages of automatic seed sowing, adjusting the seed sowing amount at any time, uniform seed sowing, being suitable for both rice and wheat double cropping areas and cotton and wheat double cropping areas, smooth walking, light and easy to use, less labor consumption, and low cost. The prefectural committee decided to use this strip seeder as a standardized strip seeder for promotion throughout the region. Selecting samples for standardization is a very meticulous work, requiring leaders to go deep into the tool reform construction site and the fields, and specifically study with the reform experts, and repeatedly test with the masses, and study the specifications, dimensions, materials, and installation of each small part well, without any carelessness, otherwise it will affect the quality of the tool and the healthy development of the entire movement. Selecting samples for standardization is also a process from the masses to the masses: first, the best tools from all over the country are selected from bottom to top, and a live competition is held, and the leaders, workers, farmers, and technicians jointly evaluate and appraise them, analyze the advantages and disadvantages, and then concentrate the reform experts, concentrate the advantages and disadvantages of various tools, reform and create new improved tools, and then after on-site testing, evaluation and appraisal, repeated research and improvement, and finally standardization. After standardization, the method of "dissecting a sparrow" is used to stipulate the structure, parts, specifications, dimensions, materials, and installation methods of the standardized tools, and draw diagrams, and hold on-site training classes, where a group of technically skilled workers are drawn from various places to manufacture sample tools according to the diagrams under the guidance of reform experts and bring them back for imitation. In the manufacturing process, some places form temporary manufacturing plants with counties and communes as units, according to the type of tools manufactured, and concentrate on manufacturing. The parts and tools are identified, accepted, and strictly guaranteed for quality to avoid deviation.

(III)

On the basis of the selection and standardization of single new and improved tools, matching new and improved tools into complete sets according to production processes is the inevitable trend of the development of the tool reform movement. Things are interconnected, and the production processes of agriculture are interconnected like the production processes of industry. Especially after the widespread reform of cultivation methods and the large-scale use of new and improved tools and semi-mechanized and mechanized tools in agricultural production, this relationship of mutual restriction and complementarity between processes is even closer. For example, after using a ten-row strip seeder in wheat sowing, the row spacing of wheat has certain specifications, and old-fashioned weeding tools are no longer suitable, requiring the creation and modification of weeding tools that are compatible with the new sowing method. If you want to plant cotton stubble flowers, you have to create and modify new cotton seeders. The promotion of new cotton seeders requires the use of new cotton weeding tools. Therefore, the reform of one tool inevitably involves all aspects of cultivation, which requires the tool reform of individual processes to develop into a comprehensive reform of all processes, and requires the selection and standardization of single tools to develop into matching new and improved tools into complete sets according to production processes. This can not only improve work efficiency but also improve cultivation quality. The matching of new and improved tools into complete sets requires comprehensive planning. When formulating the plan, it is necessary to carefully consider the mutual connection between each process, so that the new and improved tools used in each process are connected from top to bottom, supplementing what is lacking, and improving the tools that are not suitable. In particular, the "dragon head" must be done well. For example, in the cotton cultivation tool reform production line, the cotton seeder is the "dragon head". Only by first determining the cotton seeder can we select samples for standardization on tools such as ditching, middle cultivating, soil cultivation, weeding, topdressing, pest control, and straw pulling according to its row spacing and other specifications. In the process of realizing comprehensive planning, we still have to fight in stages, with long-term plans and short-term arrangements, starting from the needs of current production, and closely combining the promotion of current production with the realization of matching tools into complete sets, and gradually realizing the matching of new and improved tools into complete sets.

(IV)

After having new and improved tools, we must also use and manage them well, and constantly solve problems such as use, repair, and storage. In each problem, such as the use aspect, we must not only solve a series of problems such as habitual forces, technology, and tool quality, but also solve the coordination of all aspects. If there is a vehicle but the road cannot keep up, the vehicle still cannot be used; if there is a road but the labor quota and labor organization are not done well, it will still affect the enthusiasm for using the vehicle. With the deepening of the tool reform movement in Xiangyang Prefecture, various places are constantly solving these new problems by combining manufacturing and repair, combining technical training, and combining use and management. In order to solve the problems of use and repair, some places have organized the workers and farmers who originally participated in the temporary manufacturing plant into repair and technical counseling groups, distributed them to contract in different areas, and provided technical training and repaired tools. Since the tools are manufactured by them, and they provide use and repair technology and repair tools, they can do it quickly and economically. At the same time, in the process of providing technical training and repairing tools, they can directly discover and understand the shortcomings exposed in the use of new and improved tools and the opinions of the masses from practice, and study on the spot with the masses to continuously improve and improve them.

In terms of agricultural tool storage, the Gongnong Production Team of Lishan Commune in Sui County has done a relatively good job. The agricultural tools of this team are managed by levels, work groups, and individuals, and whoever uses them manages them. The production team and the small team have agricultural tool storage warehouses, and the small team's storage warehouse is located in the canteen, which is convenient for the members to use and store tools. In addition, they adhere to the implementation of the reward and punishment system to encourage the enthusiasm of the members to manage the agricultural tools well. The members of this team have generally developed the style and habit of cherishing the property of the commune and carefully maintaining agricultural tools, and the damage to agricultural tools is very small. This experience is being promoted throughout the region.

Although Xiangyang Prefecture has achieved some achievements in tool reform, there are still many problems that have not been solved. Furthermore, with the continuous development of the mass movement of tool reform, many new problems will inevitably arise. Our future task is to continue to go deep, solve these new problems specifically and continuously, be down-to-earth, consistent, and promote the in-depth and sustained development of the mass movement of tool reform to ensure the continuous leap forward in agricultural production!

    工具改革抓早抓准，选样定型，配套成龙
    中共湖北襄阳地委第一书记　焦德秀
    襄阳专区连年增产，其中工具改革起了重要作用。今年全区夏收作物面积比去年扩大25％左右，夏播面积扩大20％多，夏粮入库比去年夏季增加二亿多斤，收割、脱粒、运输、播种等方面的工作量都大大增加。但是，参加夏收夏种的劳动力并没有增加，相反地还有一批劳动力在进行水利等方面的建设。在这种情况下，夏收夏种却比去年完成早，夏粮入库比去年提前二十五天完成。主要原因之一就是大搞以“四改两消灭”和农业半机械化为中心的工具改革群众运动，提高了工效。（四改两消灭，即把人力车水改为自流灌溉，把肩挑背驮改为车船和滑丝滑道运输，把落后耕作工具改为改良工具，把人力加工改为机械化、半机械化加工，达到消灭肩挑背驮，消灭人力车水）。几年来我们体会到，以“四改两消灭”和农业半机械化为中心的工具改革群众运动，是解决农业连年增产中劳动力不足矛盾的主要途径，也是加速实现农业技术改造的必经阶段。几年来在工具改革上，我们主要抓住了以下几点，这就是抓早抓准，选样定型，配套成龙，用好管好。
    （一）
    农业生产有很强的季节性，所以工具改革必须及早动手准备，上季抓下季，今年看到明年，走在农业季节的前面，宁让工具等季节，不让季节等工具。如果动手晚了，改革的工具即使再多再好，在当年季节里也不能发挥应有的作用。我们是在上年冬季就抓下年的春耕工具，春季抓夏收夏种和田间管理的工具，夏季抓秋收冬播工具。从春季以来，我们就抓住了短途运输、收割、脱粒、加工、炊事等方面的工具改革，大搞群众运动。到夏收以前，全区已有人畜力板车五十二万多部，平均每四个劳动力有一部；建成水力、畜力加工点七万八千多处，平均每个生产队有一点五处。另外还推广了插秧机、收割机、鐥镰、脱粒机、改良石磙等新式改良农具二十多万件。这些工具投入夏收夏种，据计算节省了两、三百万个劳动日和四、五十万个畜工。
    我们在抓早的同时，还要抓准。所谓抓准，就是抓住农业增产的关键措施，使工具和关键措施相适应。比如明年小麦增产的关键措施是开荒扩大面积和深耕，就必须抓住开荒和深耕工具的改革。这是一方面。另一方面，还得抓住费工最多、季节性很强的薄弱环节。比如夏收中的脱粒、运输工作量最大，时间性很强，光靠槤枷脱粒和肩挑运输不行，就必须抓住脱粒、运输工具的改革。这就是说在工具改革上也要善于抓住主要矛盾。襄阳专区是稻麦两熟和棉麦两熟的地区。夏季既要收起来，又要种下去，是全年增产有决定意义的关键季节，也是劳动力最紧张的季节。根据这个特点，我们全年是以夏收夏种的工具改革为重点。可是，夏收夏种所需要的工具很多，有收割、脱粒、运输、加工、整田、播种等各方面的工具。在这些方面也必须分清主次。我们今年集中力量抓住了其中占用劳动力最多、使用时间最长的短途运输、脱粒和加工等方面的工具改革。目前，我们在大抓冬播工具改革，确定以改革深耕、条播工具为主攻方向。抓住主攻方向后，就集中优势兵力，大改大制。采用攻关战役的办法大搞工具改革，比零打碎敲的办法好，在短时间内可以收到显著效果。
    （二）
    在工具改革的群众运动中，发明创造层出不穷。因此，必须加强领导，及时地作好选样定型工作，有领导有计划有组织地推广。选样定型是保证工具改革群众运动既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实健康地发展的关键。我们确定凡是要在全区普遍推广的工具，如随县的七网十四幅木轮板车，郧西的水力加工一条龙，南漳的改良犁，襄樊市的庞公式三行自动条播器等，都是书记挂帅，全党动手，经过反复试验、选样定型的。从小麦连年增产中，我们发现庞公公社创制的三行自动下籽条播器是一种很好的条播工具，它能自动下籽，下籽均匀。地委研究冬播准备工作时就确定在庞公式三行自动下籽条播器的基础上加以改进，制出一种定型条播器，在全区推广。6月初，我就带着襄阳专区通用机械厂的农具改革能手金凤山到庞公公社，和公社农具厂的工人、社员讨论了这个问题，提出了几点需要改进的地方，组织襄阳专区通用机械厂等几个厂的工人参加改革。改制成功后，用这个三行自动下籽条播器在庞公大队种了一片麦子，籽播得均匀，行距合适。在开县委第一书记会议时，各县第一书记都到现场进行了评比鉴定，认为这种条播器具有自动下籽、随时调剂下籽量、下籽均匀、既适用于稻麦两熟地区、也适用于棉麦两熟地区、行走平稳、轻便好用、费工少、成本低等优点。地委就确定以这种条播器为定型条播器，在全区推广。选样定型是一个十分细致入微的工作，要求领导深入工具改革工地和田间，和革新能手一起具体研究，和群众一道反复试验，对每个细小部件的规格、尺码、用料、安装都要研究好，不能有一点粗枝大叶，不然就要影响工具的质量，影响整个运动的健康发展。选样定型也是一个从群众中来到群众中去的过程：先是自下而上地挑选各地最好的工具，集中现场比武，由领导、工人、农民和技术人员共同评比鉴定，分析优缺点，然后集中革新能手，集中各式工具的优缺点，改制出新的改良工具，又经过现场试验，评比鉴定，反复研究和改进，最后定型。在定型后，又用“解剖麻雀”的办法，将定型工具的构造、部件、规格、尺码、用料、安装办法等一一作出规定，绘成图样，并举办现场训练班，由各地抽出一批技术较高的工人，在革新能手的指导下，按照图样制造样版工具，带回去仿制。在制造中，有的地方以县、社为单位，按制造的工具类别，组成临时制造厂，集中制造。一个部件、一件工具地鉴定、验收，严格保证质量，避免走样。
    （三）
    在单体新式、改良工具选样定型的基础上，按生产工序把新式、改良工具配套成龙，是工具改革运动发展的必然趋势。事物是互相联系的，农业生产工序之间也像工业生产工序之间一样是互相联系的。特别是在农业生产中广泛进行耕作方法的改革和大量采用新式、改良工具和半机械化、机械化工具后，工序之间的这种互相制约、相辅相成的关系更加紧密。比如在小麦播种中，采用十行条播器后，小麦行距有一定规格，用旧式锄草工具就不行了，要求创制和改制同新的播种方法相适应的锄草工具。如果种麦茬花，还得创制和改制新的棉花播种器。而新的棉花播种器的推行，又要求使用新的棉花锄草工具。因此一项工具的改革必然牵涉到耕作的各个方面，这就要求个别工序的工具改革发展为全部工序的全盘改革，要求单体工具的选样定型发展为按生产工序把新式、改良工具配套成龙。这样作不仅可以提高工效，而且可以提高耕作质量。新式、改良工具的配套成龙要有全面规划。在制订规划时，必须要周密地考虑到各道工序之间的互相联合，使各道工序采用的新式、改良工具上下衔接，缺什么、补什么，哪种工具不适用、就改良哪种工具。特别是“龙头”要搞好。比如棉花耕作工具改革一条龙，棉花播种器就是个“龙头”。只有把棉花播种器首先定下来，然后才能按照它的行距等规格来在开沟、中耕培土、锄草、追肥、除虫、拔秆等工具上选样定型。在实现全面规划的过程中，也还是要分段作战，有长计划，短安排，从当前生产需要入手，把促进当前生产和实现配套成龙紧密结合起来，逐步实现新式、改良工具的配套成龙。
    （四）
    有了新式、改良工具之后，还要用好管好，不断解决如使用、修配、保管等问题。在每个问题中，比如使用方面，不仅要解决习惯势力、技术、工具质量等一系列的问题，还要解决各方面的配合问题。有了车子，路跟不上，车子还是不能用起来；有了路，劳动定额、劳动组织不搞好，还会影响使用车子的积极性。襄阳专区随着工具改革运动的深入发展，各地采用制造和修配、传授技术相结合，使用和管理相结合等办法，正在不断地解决这些新的问题。为了解决使用和修配问题，有的地方把原来参加临时制造厂的工人、农民组成修配和技术辅导小组，分散下去，分片包干，传授技术，修配工具。由于工具是他们制造的，由他们传授使用和修理技术，修配工具，能做到多快好省。同时，在传授技术和修配工具的过程中，他们又能从实践中直接发现和了解新式、改良工具在使用中暴露出来的缺点和群众的意见，并和群众一道，现场研究，不断地改进、提高。
    在农具保管上，随县厉山公社工农生产队搞得比较好。这个队的农具是分级分作业组分人管理，谁用谁管。生产队和小队建有农具保管库，小队的保管库设在食堂，社员用、存工具都很方便。另外还坚持执行奖惩制度，鼓励社员管好农具的积极性。这个队的社员已经普遍养成爱护公社财产，细心维护农具的风尚和习惯，农具损坏很少。这个经验正在全区推广。
    襄阳专区在工具改革上，虽然取得了一些成绩，但是尚未解决的问题也还是不少的。再者，随着工具改革群众运动的不断发展，也必然要带来许许多多新问题。我们今后的任务，就是要继续深入下去，具体地、不断地解决这些新问题，踏踏实实，一贯到底，促进工具改革群众运动深入地、持久地发展，保证农业生产持续跃进！
