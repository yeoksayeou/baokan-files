Lunch time has arrived, and a group of children are swarming into the dining hall. Cook Sun Fengrong affectionately greets the children to wash their hands, and then delivers the meals one by one to the tables, which the children eat with relish. Before long, the factory gets off work, and a group of female production workers come in, happily sitting at their children's tables to eat.

Wei Shurong, a production worker from the commune's refractory material factory, walked to the table and saw that stir-fried dishes, steamed buns, and mung bean porridge had already been placed on the table. He said to the three children sitting around the table with satisfaction: "In this hot weather, the food is so delicious, it's even better than eating at home!"

Suddenly, a worker with a face full of sweat ran into the dining hall, asking for food as soon as he entered. Wang Fenglan, the director of the dining hall, patiently said to him: "Comrade, there's water over there, wash your face first, it'll be cooler to eat." This worker was named Cui Fengshan, an electrician from the Chongwen District Construction Bureau. Hearing that he was asked to wash his face, he said to Wang Fenglan a little impatiently: "Forget it, I have to go to work at one o'clock, just give me the food!" Seeing this situation, Wang Fenglan more patiently said to him: "I know you like to eat spicy dishes and steamed buns, I'll prepare them for you, I guarantee you'll be eating as soon as you finish washing your face." Cui Fengshan was persuaded. He washed his face and enjoyed a comfortable lunch.

Since the beginning of summer, the Xisikuaiyu Dining Hall of the Ti Yu Guan Lu People's Commune has devised many ways to ensure that people eat their fill, eat well, eat cleanly, and get good nutrition. The dining hall is very clean, the windows are covered with white cooling cloth, the stove doors in the kitchen are outside the wall, the tools for cutting vegetables are used separately for raw and cooked food, and the tableware is disinfected every meal. Every morning at four o'clock, the cooks boil a large pot of porridge and let it cool, so that people don't feel hot when they eat it. Every time it's mealtime, they observe people's preferences. When they find that people especially like to eat cold dishes in the summer, they try to make a few cold dishes every day. (Attached picture)

    食堂胜似家
    中午开饭的时间到了，一群孩子拥进食堂。炊事员孙凤荣爱抚地招呼孩子们洗完手，然后又把饭菜一份一份地送到桌上，孩子们津津有味地吃着。不一会儿，工厂下班了，一群女生产人员进来了，她们高兴地坐在自己孩子的桌子旁边吃起饭来。
    公社耐火材料厂生产人员魏书荣走到桌旁，看见桌上已经摆好了炒菜、馒头和绿豆稀饭，满意地对坐在桌子周围的三个孩子说：“大热天，饭菜做的多顺口啊，比在家吃还好吧！”
    忽然，一位满脸是汗的工人跑进食堂，他一进门就要买饭。食堂主任王凤兰耐心地对他说：“同志，那儿有水，先洗把脸吧，吃饭也凉快。”这位工人叫崔凤山，是崇文区建设局的电工。听说叫他洗脸，就有些不耐烦地对王凤兰说：“得了，我一点就上班，给我饭吧！”看到这情景，王凤兰更加耐心地对他说：“我知道你爱吃辣菜和馒头，我给你准备好，保证你洗完脸就吃饭。”崔凤山被说服了。他洗脸回来，舒服地吃了一顿午饭。
    入夏以来，体育馆路人民公社西四块玉食堂，想了许多办法让人们吃饱吃好，吃得干净，还有营养。食堂很清洁，窗户都糊着白色的冷布，厨房里的炉门开在墙外边，切菜的用具都是生、熟菜分开使用，食具每餐一消毒。每天早上四点钟，炊事人员就煮好一大锅稀饭凉着，好让人们吃的时候不觉得热。每到吃饭的时候，她们都要观察人们的爱好，当她们发现人们在夏天特别爱吃凉菜的时候，每天都要想办法做几个凉菜。（附图片）
