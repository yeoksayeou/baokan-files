Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Electric Telegram: Changchun City's fifty-four factories and schools, in supporting the agricultural technical transformation of Dehui County's communes, have developed the experience of "factory-commune pairing." According to the specialties of each unit, they have formed three agricultural support collaboration networks: electrical, mechanical power, and science and technology. These networks help Dehui County, in a more organized, planned, and focused manner, to comprehensively arm county and commune industries, accelerating agricultural technical transformation.

Changchun Passenger Car Factory, Xingdong Machinery Factory, Changchun Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Factory, Changchun Geological Institute, and fifty other units have been paired with Dehui County's communes since the beginning of this year. Over the past six months, with the help of these units, all nineteen communes in Dehui County have established agricultural machinery repair and assembly plants. Many communes have power generation equipment and small and medium-sized agricultural machinery manufacturing plants, basically achieving major repairs of agricultural machinery within the county, medium repairs within the commune, and minor repairs within the management district. However, due to the continuous development of agricultural production and technical transformation, the support tasks are becoming increasingly heavy, and the strength of only a few units is no longer sufficient. To adapt to this new situation, the Changchun Passenger Car Factory and the fifty-four other units, after joint research with the Dehui County Party Committee, decided to organize all the supporting units on the basis of the original "several factories supporting one commune," and form three agricultural support collaboration networks. The three networks are the mechanical support collaboration network composed of the Passenger Car Factory, Xingdong Machinery Factory, etc.; the electrical support collaboration network composed of the First Electrical Machinery Factory, Changchun Power School, etc.; and the science and technology collaboration network composed of the Changchun Geological Institute, etc. Each support collaboration network has selected a unit as the leader, and established a regular meeting, reporting, and inspection system to frequently study and allocate the collaborative support tasks of each unit, and to supervise and inspect to ensure the timely completion of the task of supporting agricultural technical transformation.

Changchun City's fifty-four units adopting this new form of supporting agriculture can not only further promote the spirit of great collaboration, but also concentrate the main forces to solve major equipment and material problems. For example, the Guo Jia and Yang Shu communes needed to solve the problem of power equipment for building power stations, but the Lao Mao Sheng Candy Factory and Changchun Institute of Physical Education, which were paired with them, did not have the strength to help solve this problem. Now, the electrical collaboration network has taken over all the communes in the county that have not yet built power stations, and is helping to build power stations in batches on a regular basis, thus solving the problems of the Guo Jia and Yang Shu communes.

The adoption of the new form of agricultural support collaboration network has led to a new situation of more planned, organized, focused, and comprehensive and balanced development in agricultural support work. Now, on the basis of the original pairing, each collaboration network is actively acting according to the new collaborative relationship, formulating plans, and implementing its own assigned tasks. The mechanical power collaboration network plans to help all nineteen communes in the county equip their agricultural tool repair and manufacturing plants with five machines (electric motors, generators, electric welders, blowers, and grinding wheels) and five machine tools (lathes, drilling machines, grinders, planers, and milling machines) this year. These equipments and accessories are currently being actively rushed to manufacture in various factories. The power collaboration network plans to help nine communes build power stations in three batches. (Attached picture)

    长春市五十四个工厂学校组成支援农业协作网
    统一安排力量支援县社工业
    据新华社长春电　长春市五十四个工厂学校在支援德惠县各公社农业技术改造中，发展了“厂社挂钩”的经验，按照各单位的特长，分别组成电气、机械动力、科学技术等三个支援农业协作网，帮助德惠县更有组织、有计划、有重点地全面武装县、社工业，加速农业技术改造。
    长春客车厂、兴东机械厂、长春电机制造厂和长春地质学院等五十四个单位，从今年年初起就和德惠县各公社挂了钩。半年多来，德惠县的十九个公社在这些单位的帮助下，都已建立起了农业机械修配厂，许多公社有了发电设备和中小型农业机械制造厂，基本上实现了农业机具大修不出县、中修不出社、小修不出管理区。但是，由于农业生产和技术改造的不断发展，支援任务越来越重，单靠几个单位力量已经不够了。为了适应这一新的情况，长春客车厂等五十四个单位经和中共德惠县委共同研究，确定在原来数厂包一社的基础上，把所有支援单位组织起来，分别组成了三个支援农业协作网。三个网是由客车厂，兴东机械厂等组成机械支援协作网；由第一电机厂、长春电力学校等组成电气支援协作网；由长春地质学院等单位组成科学技术协作网。各个支援协作网都分别选出一个单位为组长，并且建立了定期会议、汇报和检查制度，经常研究和分配各单位的协作支援任务，进行督促检查，保证支援农业技术改造的任务按期完成。
    长春市五十四个单位采取这种新的形式支援农业，不仅可以进一步发挥大协作精神，而且能够集中主要力量，解决较重大的设备、物质等方面的问题。例如，郭家、杨树等公社需要解决建电站的动力设备，但是同他们挂钩的老茂生糖果厂、长春体育学院等单位没有力量帮助解决这个问题。现在由电气协作网把全县没有建电站的公社包下来，分批定期帮助建立电站，郭家、杨树等公社的问题也就解决了。
    采取支援农业协作网的新形式，使支援农业工作出现了更加有计划、有组织、有重点和全面均衡发展的新局面。现在各协作网都在原来挂钩的基础上，按着新的协作关系，积极行动，制订计划，落实自己分担的任务。机械动力协作网准备在今年内帮助全县十九个公社的农具修造厂配齐五机（电动机、发电机、电焊机、鼓风机、砂轮机）、五床（车床、钻床、磨床、刨床、铣床），这些设备和配件目前正在各厂积极赶制。电力协作网准备分三批帮助九个公社办电站。（附图片）
