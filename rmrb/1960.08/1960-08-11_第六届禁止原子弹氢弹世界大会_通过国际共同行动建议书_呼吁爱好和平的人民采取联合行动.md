Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th. The Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament passed a proposal for international joint action on the 9th. The full text is as follows:

We, the representatives from twenty-eight countries and ten international organizations, together with ten thousand Japanese representatives participating in the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament, propose the following joint actions to peace-loving people of all countries in the world:

One, we call on the people of all countries to put pressure on their governments to engage in sincere and effective negotiations at the next United Nations Organization General Assembly to achieve the abolition of foreign bases, general disarmament, peaceful coexistence, and respect for the independence and sovereignty of all nations.

Two, we demand the launch of international joint action to urge governments to find ways to hold a summit conference of the heads of all countries in the near future in order to negotiate a disarmament agreement.

Three, we must be highly vigilant against the U.S. government resuming nuclear testing. We must do everything in our power to prevent the resumption of nuclear testing. If testing is resumed, we call on all countries in the world to launch a protest movement.

Four, further strengthen international cooperation in assisting atomic bomb victims. To help develop this cooperation, we call on all countries to invite atomic bomb victims to visit their countries, thereby promoting the movement to spread the facts about atomic bomb victims.

Five, we believe that it is very important to clarify the disasters caused by radioactive materials and make many people aware of these disasters. We call on scientists around the world to maintain contact with each other in order to launch their joint investigations.

Six, we fully understand that the work of assisting atomic bomb victims, which has developed along with the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs, has achieved and will achieve good results. To strengthen the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs, it is suggested that an information center be established in Tokyo to collect and disseminate information about the actual consequences of nuclear armament and nuclear bombs. We call on all countries in the world to help establish this information center and make full use of its materials and information.

Seven, it is suggested that a collection of true images of the realities of atomic and hydrogen bombs be published in order to further inform people of the true extent of the damage caused by atomic and hydrogen bombs in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Bikini Atoll.

    新华社10日讯　东京消息：第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会9日通过了国际共同行动建议书。全文如下：
    我们，参加第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的来自世界二十八个国家、十个国际组织的代表和一万名日本代表向全世界爱好和平的各国人民建议采取下列联合行动：
    一、我们呼吁各国人民对他们的政府施加压力，要求它们在下届联合国组织大会中为实现撤消外国基地、全面裁军、和平共处和尊重各国的独立和主权进行真诚和有效的谈判。
    二、我们要求展开国际共同行动，促使各国政府设法使一切国家的首脑会议能够在最近的将来举行，以便谈判裁军协议。
    三、我们必须严密提防美国政府恢复核试验。我们必须竭尽全力防止恢复核试验，如果竟然恢复试验，我们呼吁世界各国展开抗议运动。
    四、进一步加强救济原子弹受害者的国际合作。为了有助于发展这种合作，我们呼吁世界各国邀请原子弹受害者访问它们的国家，从而促进传播原子弹受害者实况的运动。
    五、我们认为，阐明放射性物质所造成的灾难并使许多人都知道这种灾难，是非常重要的。我们号召召集全世界科学家彼此保持联系，以便展开他们的联合调查工作。
    六、我们完全理解到，同反对原子弹和氢弹运动一起发展的救济原子弹受害者的工作，已经取得而且将取得良好的结果。为了加强反对原子弹和氢弹的运动，建议在东京成立一个情报中心，来搜集和分发关于核武装和核弹实际后果的资料。我们号召世界各国帮助建立这个情报中心和充分利用它的材料和资料。
    七、建议出版关于原子弹和氢弹实难的真实图片集，以便进一步使人们知道原子弹和氢弹在广岛、长崎和比基尼岛所造成的损害的真实情况。
