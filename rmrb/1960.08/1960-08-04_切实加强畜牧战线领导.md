Inner Mongolia: Large Numbers of Cadres Go Deep into Pastures Qinghai: Measures Taken to Vigorously Improve Livestock Condition Tibet: Planning Pastures for Rational Grazing
Earnestly Strengthen Leadership on the Animal Husbandry Front
Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot News—Party committee secretaries in various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are leading a large number of cadres deep into pastures, livestock herds, and breeding stations to vigorously strengthen leadership on the front lines of animal husbandry production. This has powerfully promoted the comprehensive leap forward in the region's work of fattening livestock and improving breeding.

At the very beginning of the 1961 animal husbandry production year (from July 1 this year to the end of June next year), the Autonomous Region Party Committee issued a call to take "one hundred mothers, one hundred offspring" and safe overwintering as the guiding principles, seize the favorable opportunity of July, August, and September, and launch a mass production "open door red" campaign throughout the region. The grasslands of the Xilin Gol League and Hulunbuir League, the main pastoral areas of the autonomous region, adopted a leadership method of assigning responsibility layer by layer and contracting everything to the end, strengthening leadership in animal husbandry production. Some were led by the first secretary of the banner party committee, who led work groups to go deep into the communes, state-owned pastures, and breeding stations to check and solve problems while participating in grazing management. Others moved the banner party committee office to the commune and transferred cadres to work in production teams for half a year. In agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, party organizations at all levels grasped agriculture with one hand and animal husbandry with the other. While transferring cadres to strengthen leadership over the central tasks of autumn field management, summer harvesting, and summer planting, they promptly reversed the tendency of some communes to neglect animal husbandry production and strengthened the forces on the front lines of animal husbandry.

Currently, in addition to some areas that are stepping up the fight against drought to protect livestock, the condition of all kinds of livestock is constantly improving. By mid-July, the total number of large livestock bred and improved in the region had reached 880,000 head, an increase of more than five times compared with the same period last year, and the breeding and improvement of small livestock had also been completed for more than 1.45 million head.
Xinhua News Agency—People's communes in agricultural areas of Qinghai Province are taking various measures to strengthen the feeding and management of draft animals during the current season when green grass is lush and the use of draft animals is relatively low, so as to improve livestock condition in preparation for the upcoming autumn harvest and autumn plowing.

Communes in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, which are mainly engaged in agricultural production, have recently been driving draft animals to the mountains to rest and improve their condition. They have generally adopted methods such as extending grazing time and adding night grazing to allow livestock to eat more green grass and supplementing them with green oil, green salt, green tea, and soup made from various wild animal meats. In order to improve the condition of livestock in preparation for the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, the Hongqi Production Team of the Laoya Commune in Ledu County classified and ranked all 488 draft animals in the team, assigned special personnel to manage them, and grazed them in separate groups on the mountains. They drove cattle and donkeys with poor cold resistance to the low mountain areas for circle grazing, and drove stronger mules and horses to the deep mountain areas for circle grazing.

While organizing draft animals to go to the mountains to improve their condition, various places have also strengthened the feeding and management of draft animals that remain in the commune for work. The Dongdanma Production Team of the Halazhigou Commune in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County re-studied the management methods for draft animal use during the rest period, ensuring that they added grass frequently, provided water frequently, padded the pen frequently, cleaned the trough frequently, and brushed the livestock frequently. They strictly implemented a responsibility system that included special personnel for use, fixed load weight, fixed basic farm work, and inspection after use. As a result, the team eliminated third-class condition livestock.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 2nd—Herdsmen in the vast pastoral areas of Shannan, Northern Tibet, Ali, and other places in Tibet have begun to make preliminary plans for pastures, implement rational grazing, and reclaim wasteland to gradually cultivate and expand grasslands.

In the past, under the rule of the feudal serf system, the vast pastoral areas of Tibet were occupied by landlords, grazing was chaotic, and the grasslands were greatly damaged, which could not guarantee that livestock had enough grazing land in all seasons. Now, under the care and leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the emancipated herdsmen in the vast pastoral areas of Northern Tibet, Shannan, Ali, and other places have begun to make preliminary and rational plans for grasslands, and a new grazing scene has emerged on the grasslands.

Recently, herdsmen in Lhozhag and Lhagari Counties in the Shannan Prefecture have implemented a system of rotating grazing of pastures in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Herdsmen from tribes such as Mendui, Chiba, and Riwa in Nagqu Prefecture, Northern Tibet, have comprehensively planned their grasslands based on the seasonal grazing habits of "grazing sunny slopes in winter and cool slopes in summer." In July, herdsmen from more than 200 large tribes in Northern Tibet drove cattle and sheep to the mountains for grazing during the fattening period according to this year's new plan, leaving many plains, river valleys, and low-lying grasslands as grazing grounds for the winter and spring seasons.

Since the beginning of summer, the pastoral areas and purely pastoral areas of Zhegu, Lhozhag, Lhagari, and Sangri Counties in Shannan Prefecture, Nagqu Prefecture in Northern Tibet, and some counties in Ali Prefecture have begun to cultivate and expand grasslands in a planned manner. While driving cattle and sheep to the mountains for grazing, herdsmen are also digging ditches and repairing canals in plains and low-lying areas to irrigate grasslands, and reclaiming wasteland, building walls, planting pasture, and cultivating pasture bases.

In order to help herdsmen in various places gradually improve pasture and cultivate pasture bases, the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Department of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region has allocated a large amount of alfalfa seeds to Ali, Nagqu, Shannan, and other prefectures, which can be used to plant more than 8,000 mu of alfalfa.

    切实加强畜牧战线领导
    新华社呼和浩特讯　内蒙古自治区各地党组织书记率领大批干部，深入牧场、畜群和配种站，大力加强畜牧业生产第一线领导，有力地推动了全区牲畜抓膘、配种改良等工作的全面跃进。
    1961年畜牧业生产年度（从今年7月1日开始到明年6月底为止）刚一开始，自治区党委就提出以百母百仔和安全过冬为纲，抓紧7、8、9三个月的有利时机，在全区开展一个群众性的生产开门红运动的号召。自治区的主要牧区锡林郭勒盟、呼伦贝尔盟的草原，采取层层负责一包到底的领导方法，加强畜牧生产的领导。有的由旗党委第一书记挂帅，带领工作组深入公社、国营牧场和配种站，边检查，边解决问题，并参加放牧管理。有的把旗党委办公室搬到公社，抽调干部下放到生产队工作半年。在农业区和半农半牧区，各级党组织一手抓农业、一手抓畜牧业，在抽调干部加强对秋田管理、夏收夏种等中心工作领导的同时，及时扭转了部分公社忽视畜牧业生产的倾向，充实了畜牧业第一线力量。
    目前，除部分地区正抓紧进行抗旱保畜斗争外，各种大小牲畜膘情不断上升。到7月中旬，全区大家畜配种改良总数已达八十八万头，比去年同期增加了五倍多，小家畜的配种改良也已完成一百四十五万多头。
    新华社讯　青海省农业区各人民公社，乘当前青草茂盛和使用耕畜较少的季节，采取各种措施，加强耕畜的饲养管理，抓好畜膘，迎接即将到来的秋收和秋翻。
    海北藏族自治州门源回族自治县以农业生产为主的公社，近来都赶着耕畜上山休整抓膘，普遍采取延长放牧时间加夜牧等办法，让牲畜多吃青草，并适当补饲青油、青盐、青茶和各种野牲肉熬的汤。乐都县老鸦公社红旗生产队为了抓好畜膘迎接秋收秋翻，将全队四百八十八头耕畜分类排队，指定专人经营，分群上山放牧。他们把抗寒能力较差的牛、驴赶到低山地区打圈放牧，把体质较壮的骡、马赶到深山地区坐圈放牧。
    各地在组织耕畜上山抓膘的同时，对留在社里使役的耕畜也加强了饲养管理。互助土族自治县哈拉直沟公社东丹麻生产队在耕畜休整期间重新研究了使役管理方法，做到勤添草、勤饮水、勤垫圈、勤扫槽、勤刷畜体，严格执行专人使用、定载重量、定基本农活、使役后进行检查等责任制度，因而全队牲畜消灭了三类膘。
    据新华社拉萨2日电　西藏山南、藏北、阿里等广大牧区的牧民们，已开始对牧场进行初步规划，实行合理放牧，并开垦荒地，逐步培植和扩大草原。
    过去，在封建农奴制度的统治下，西藏的广大牧区都被领主所霸占，放牧混乱，对草场破坏很大，不能保证牲畜四季都有足够的放牧场地。现在，在党和人民政府的关怀和领导下，藏北、山南、阿里等广大牧区的翻身牧民们，开始对草场进行初步合理的规划，草原上出现了一片崭新的牧放景象。
    最近，山南专区洛扎、拉加里县的牧民对草场实行了春、夏、秋、冬四季轮流牧放的制度。藏北那曲专区的门堆、赤巴、日瓦等部落的牧民们，根据“冬放阳、夏放凉”的季节性牧放习惯，对草场进行了全面规划。在7月间，藏北二百多个大部落的牧民们，就按照今年的新规划，把牛羊赶上山去，进行抓膘时期的牧放，把很多平川、河谷和洼地草原留作冬春季的牧放草场。
    入夏以来，山南专区哲古、洛扎、拉加里、桑日等县的牧业区和纯牧区的藏北那曲专区以及阿里专区的部分县，已开始有计划地培植和扩大草场。牧民们一面把牛羊赶上山去牧放，一面在平原和低洼地带，挖沟修渠，灌溉草原，并开垦荒地、砌围墙、种牧草，培植牧草基地。
    为帮助各地牧民逐步改良牧草，培植牧草基地，西藏自治区筹委会农牧处，已经拨给阿里、那曲、山南等专区大批苜蓿种，这些种子可以种植八千多亩苜蓿。
