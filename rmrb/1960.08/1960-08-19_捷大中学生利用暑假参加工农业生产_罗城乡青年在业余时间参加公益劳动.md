    罗城乡青年在业余时间参加公益劳动
    新华社布拉格17日电　今年暑假，捷克斯洛伐克高等和中等学校已有九万四千多名学生和一千九百多个集体参加了工农业劳动。到8月11日为止，参加劳动的学生人数比去年暑假多五千人。
    在暑假到来以前，国家向大学生发出了“每一个大学生将假期中的一个月献给共和国”的号召。这个号召得到了学生们的热烈响应。
    今年暑假，学生们主要是参加农业劳动。全国有五万五千名学生参加了水利工程、积肥和在十四到十八天内完成夏收的战斗。从8月22日起，全国还将有八万五千名中学生参加为期两、三周的收获啤酒花的工作。
    此外，学生们还参加采煤、修筑铁路、修建工人宿舍等工作。
    大、中学生利用假期参加生产劳动，博得了劳动人民的称赞。在劳动中，学生同工人、农民建立了友谊的联系。
    据新华社布加勒斯特讯罗马尼亚城乡青年广泛地组织了青年爱国劳动工作队，利用业余时间参加公益劳动、收集废铁或帮助夏收等。克罗什州今年以来加入青年爱国劳动队的有二万多人，并有九万五千名青年在业余时间参加了各种爱国义务劳动。今年以来，他们共劳动了五百八十万个小时。普罗什蒂州的石油工人今年以来共做了一百万个小时的爱国义务劳动，收集了一万吨废铁和一万五千公斤石腊等。培亚马勒州农村青年今年以来清理了四万二千七百二十八公顷的牧场，为国家节约了二百一十四万多列伊。底密索拉市的青年花了三十六万四千个小时，修建了一个“青年游泳基地”，为国家节省了一百六十万列伊。
