A new sericulture base has taken initial shape in Huicheng County, Gansu Province. In recent years, the county's silkworm cocoon production has continuously increased substantially. In 1955, the entire county raised only 50 sheets of silkworms, with an average yield of 42 jin of cocoons per sheet. In 1958, 1,570 sheets of silkworms were raised, and the yield per sheet increased to 52 jin. In 1959, 2,961 sheets of silkworms were raised, and the total cocoon production increased by 60%, and a high-yield record of 189.4 jin of cocoons per sheet appeared.

Huicheng County is located in southeastern Gansu, in the upper reaches of the Jialing River, with green mountains, clear waters, and a mild climate, possessing excellent conditions for planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms. Under the guidance of the central government's "Vigorously Develop Silk Production" and the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China's idea of "Building the Longnan Mountain Area into a Sericulture Base," since 1955, the cadres and masses here have worked hard and diligently, carried out huge basic construction work, and launched a mass movement of planting mulberry trees and cultivating seedlings, laying the foundation for the rapid development of sericulture. This year, the county plans to raise 6,500 sheets of silkworms throughout the year, more than double that of last year. The 2,690 sheets of silkworms raised this spring have already achieved an all-round bumper harvest, with an average yield of 53 jin per sheet.

Now, except for the high-altitude cold mountainous areas where mulberry trees cannot be planted, silkworm-raising production teams account for 88.37% of the total number of production teams in the county. Historically, many oak forests that had never been used for raising silkworms have also been widely used to raise tussah silkworms. In the past five years, combined with the tree planting and afforestation movement, the county has cultivated more than 9,500 mu of mulberry seedlings and planted more than 86 million mulberry trees, and has built three 10,000-mu mulberry orchards, four 5,000-mu mulberry orchards, six 1,000-mu mulberry orchards, and one hundred and thirty-two 100-mu mulberry orchards. Improved varieties such as Huzhou mulberry have been basically popularized. At the same time, the county has also established a modern silkworm seed breeding farm, a mulberry nursery, a silk reeling factory, and a sericulture school. Due to the continuous development of sericulture production, it has now become an important sideline income for the entire county. Last year, sericulture income accounted for 13% of the county's total sideline income.

Huicheng County's sericulture production is one of the fastest-growing counties in the Longnan mountainous area. Its main characteristics are:

First, a "one-stop" leadership for sericulture production has been established. The county party secretary personally takes charge, and the party organizations at all levels of the people's communes have secretaries specifically in charge of sericulture, and are equipped with a certain number of full-time cadres, strengthening leadership organizationally. In terms of leadership methods, large-scale experimental fields combining cadres, technicians, and commune members were established. The county party committee established a sericulture base experimental field in Niyang Commune, and specially dispatched three cadres to be stationed there for a long time to create experience and promote it throughout the county.

Second, establish professional organizations and strengthen scientific management. Throughout the sericulture area, production teams have generally established 510 permanent, seasonal, and temporary professional teams. In addition to many experienced old farmers, most of the members of the professional teams are technicians trained by sericulture schools and short-term training courses, which provides good conditions for popularizing scientific management and carrying out the technical innovation movement. They changed the two seasons of spring and autumn silkworm rearing to multiple silkworm rearings, used the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture to manage mulberry orchards, and adopted the method of taking soil as the main factor, combining indigenous and foreign methods, relying on self-reliance, adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and processing them locally to build 16 silkworm rearing tool processing factories, and launched a tool reform movement centered on silkworm rearing rooms and tools. This year, more than 9,000 pieces of silkworm rearing tools such as silkworm nets, silkworm racks, silkworm curtains, and reed mats have been produced. Fifty percent of the sericulture professional teams have implemented scientific feeding management methods, so that large-area high-yield records continue to appear.

Third, implement the "three guarantees and one reward" system of guaranteeing output, guaranteeing work, guaranteeing costs, and rewarding overproduction in sericulture production. On the basis of fully mobilizing the masses for repeated discussions, the goals, tasks, measures, and enthusiasm are all implemented, and leadership, labor, tasks, measures, and quality are all fixed. Many communes have widely launched challenge and response competitions between teams and between individuals. Because Niyang Commune grasped this key measure, they actively struggled against diseases and insect pests in the face of the many diseases and insect pests of mulberry trees and silkworms this spring, so that mulberry leaves still gained increased production, and silkworm cocoons gained a large-scale bumper harvest.

    一个新的蚕桑基地已经初步形成
    甘肃徽成县大力发展养蚕事业
    本报讯　一个新的蚕桑基地已在甘肃省徽成县初步形成。几年来，这个县的蚕茧生产连续大幅度地增长。1955年全县只养蚕五十张，平均每张单产茧四十二斤。1958年养蚕一千五百七十张，单产增长到五十二斤。1959年养蚕二千九百六十一张，蚕茧总产增长了60％，并且出现了每张蚕产茧一百八十九点四斤的高产纪录。
    徽成县位于甘肃东南部，嘉陵江上游，山青水秀，气候温和，具有优良的植桑养蚕条件。在中央“大力发展蚕丝生产”和中共甘肃省委关于“把陇南山区建设成为蚕桑基地”的思想指导下，从1955年以来，这里的干部和群众，发奋图强，埋头苦干，进行了巨大的基本建设工作，开展了植桑育苗的群众运动，为快速发展蚕桑事业打下了基础。这个县今年计划全年养蚕六千五百张，比去年增长了一倍多。今春饲养的二千六百九十张蚕，春蚕已经获得全面丰收，平均每张单产五十三斤。
    现在，全县除不能栽桑的高寒山区外，养蚕的生产队已占生产队总数的88.37％。历史上许多没有放养过蚕的柞林地区，也广泛被利用来放养柞蚕。近五年来，结合植树造林运动，全县已育桑苗九千五百多亩，定植桑树八千六百多万株，已建起万亩桑园三处，五千亩桑园四处，千亩桑园六处，百亩桑园一百三十二处。基本上普及了湖桑等良种。同时，这个县还建立了现代化的蚕种繁育场、桑培育所、缫丝厂和蚕桑学校。由于蚕桑生产的不断发展，现在已经成为全县一项重要副业收入。去年蚕桑收入即占全县副业总收入的13％。
    徽成县的蚕桑生产是陇南山区发展最快的一个县，它的主要特点是：
    第一，建立了蚕桑生产“一条龙”的领导，县委书记亲自挂帅，各人民公社的各级党组织均有书记专管蚕桑，并且配备了一定数量的专职干部，从组织上加强了领导。在领导方法上，大搞干部、技术员和社员三结合的试验田，县委在泥阳公社建立蚕桑基地试验田，专门派了三名干部长期驻点，创造经验，在全县推广。
    第二，建立专业组织，加强科学管理。各蚕区生产队，普遍建立了常年性、季节性和临时性的专业队五百一十个，专业队的成员，除了许多有经验的老农外，大部分是蚕桑学校和短期训练班培训出来的技术员，这就给普及科学管理工作和开展技术革新运动提供了良好条件。他们改春秋养蚕两期为多次养蚕，运用农业“八字宪法”管理桑园，采取以土为主，土洋结合，自力更生，因地制宜，就地取材，就地加工的办法，建起蚕具加工厂十六处，开展了以蚕室、蚕具为中心的工具改革运动。今年已生产蚕网、蚕架、蚕帘、苇席等蚕具达九千多件。有50％的蚕桑专业队推行了科学的饲养管理方法，使大面积丰产纪录不断出现。
    第三，贯彻执行蚕桑生产上的包产、包工、包成本和超产奖励的“三包一奖”制，在充分发动群众反复讨论的基础上，做到指标、任务、措施、干劲四落实，领导、劳力、任务、措施、质量五固定。许多公社已广泛掀起了队与队、个人与个人的挑战应战竞赛运动。泥阳公社由于抓住了这个关键措施，在今春桑树发生病虫害和蚕病多的情况下，积极和病虫害作斗争，使桑叶仍然获得了增产，蚕茧获得了大面积丰收。（附图片）
