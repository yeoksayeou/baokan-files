    Both Grasping the Key Points and Being Comprehensive, Both Doing the Central Work and Doing the Departmental Work
    Shanghang County Provides Full Sets of Cadres to Go Down to the Villages and Deepen into Communes and Teams

    (Our report) The Shanghang County Committee of Fujian Province, by organizing cadres from various departments into unified joint work groups and implementing a system of cadres going down to the villages in sets, penetrating into communes and teams to participate in and lead production, has both grasped the key points and been comprehensive, both doing the central work well and doing the departmental work well, powerfully promoting the sustained leap forward in agricultural production and various tasks.
    Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Shanghang County-level organs have adopted the method of each department being responsible for a specific area covering several communes, grasping both the central tasks and their own business, and have achieved great results. However, according to the County Committee's inspection, this method of each department being responsible for a specific area easily led to "grasping one point and losing sight of the whole," and the division of forces by various departments also easily caused a lack of connection and each department doing its own thing, preventing better exchange of experiences and better service to the central work. Since this spring, the County Committee has adopted the method of organizing joint work groups and sending cadres from various departments down to the villages in sets to solve this contradiction. The specific methods are: (1) When cadres from various departments go down to the villages, the County Committee uniformly organizes them, so that each work group has both the main cadres doing the central work and cadres from other departments. (2) The County Committee uniformly arranges a batch of communes and teams as the work focus of various departments. When assigning joint work groups to go down to the villages, it organizes leaders from various departments to lead teams, penetrate into key communes and teams, create experience, and guide the overall situation. (3) The Party Committees of each commune strengthen unified leadership over the work groups and organize the cadres sent down to carry out red flag competitions for undertaking central work and comprehensive work. The cadres of the work groups adopt the working method of "grasping everything when going out, dividing the work again when returning."
    After Shanghang County adopted the method of sending cadres down to the villages in sets, the cadres from various departments worked together, cooperated closely, and further improved the central work. For example, the Communist Youth League County Committee's key team – the Meixi Brigade of the Zhongdu Commune – launched a "Late Rice Over-Program" movement. The cadres from various departments stationed in the commune immediately cooperated with each other. The County Agricultural Bureau cadres not only vigorously promoted the "three machines" (rice transplanters, harvesters, threshers) but also carried out technical research on "Late Rice Over-Program". The County Women's Federation cadres also established "Mother and Child Happiness Gardens" to ensure that young women could better participate in production; financial and trade cadres helped rectify canteens and arrange life to ensure that commune members were well-fed. Now the "Late Rice Over-Program" movement has been extended to the entire commune, and the work of various departments is getting better and better along with the movement.
    After cadres went down to the villages in sets, the problem of combining points and surfaces was also solved. For example, in the past, County Women's Federation cadres were concentrated in the Nanyang Commune to focus on key work. Although the women's work in Nanyang Commune was done well and some experience was gained, other communes did not have Women's Federation cadres, so the combination of points and surfaces was not good. This year, some of the County Women's Federation cadres focused on key work in Nanyang Commune, while others participated in other joint work groups, so that each commune had County Women's Federation cadres. As a result, the advanced experience of establishing "Mother and Child Happiness Gardens" in Nanyang Commune was immediately promoted to various communes. Now most of the brigades in the seven communes of the county have established "Mother and Child Happiness Gardens".
    Sending cadres down to the villages in sets is also conducive to cadres from various departments learning from each other, learning from each other's strengths, and further improving their working ability and improving their leadership style. After more than 120 cadres from county-level organs were trained in Nanyang Commune, many of them have now become multi-talented "specialists with multiple skills" who can independently take charge of comprehensive work.

### 既抓重点又抓全面既做好中心工作又做好部门工作  上杭县成套配备干部下乡深入社队

    既抓重点又抓全面既做好中心工作又做好部门工作
    上杭县成套配备干部下乡深入社队
    本报讯　福建省上杭县委把各部门干部统一组成联合工作组实行干部配套下乡，深入社队参加生产领导生产，既抓重点，又抓全面，既做好了中心工作，又做好了部门工作，有力地促进了农业生产和各项工作的持续跃进。
    上杭县级机关各部门自1958年大跃进以来，就采取按部门分片包社的办法，既抓中心又抓业务，取得了很大的成绩。但据县委检查，这种各部门分片包社的作法容易“抓了一点，丢了全面”，同时各部门分兵把口，还容易造成互不联系，各搞一套的现象，不能更好地交流经验和更好地为中心工作服务。今春以来，县委采取了组织联合工作组、各部门干部配套下乡的办法来解决这个矛盾。具体办法是：（1）各部门干部下乡时，由县委统一组织，使每个工作组既有做中心工作的主要干部，又有其他各部门的干部。（2）县委统一安排一批社队，作为各部门的工作重点，在分配联合工作组下乡时，组织各部门领导分别领队，深入重点社队，创造经验，指导全面。（3）各公社党委对工作组加强统一领导，并且组织下乡干部开展包中心工作、包全面工作的红旗竞赛。工作组干部则采取“出门一把抓，回来再分家”的工作方法。
    上杭县采取干部配套下乡办法后，各部门干部在一起工作，互相协作，紧密配合，进一步做好了中心工作。例如共青团县委重点队——中都公社枚溪大队发动青年搞“晚稻跨纲要”运动，驻在该社的各部门干部立即互相配合，县农业局干部一面大抓推广“三机”（插秧机、收割机、脱粒机），一面开展“晚稻跨纲要”的技术研究，县妇联干部也设立“母子康乐园”保证青年妇女更好地参加生产；财贸干部则帮助整顿食堂，安排生活，保证社员吃饱吃好。现在“晚稻跨纲要”运动已推广到全社，各部门工作也跟着运动越做越好。
    干部配套下乡后，还解决了点面结合的问题。例如县妇联干部过去都集中在南阳公社抓重点，南阳公社妇女工作虽然做得好，并且取得一些经验，但其他各社都没有妇联干部，因此点面结合得不好。今年县妇联一部分干部在南阳社抓重点，一部分干部参加其他联合工作组，做到每个社都有县妇联干部，结果南阳社建立“母子康乐园”的先进经验，立即推广到各公社去，现在全县七个公社大部分大队都建立起“母子康乐园”。
    干部配套下乡，还有利于各部门干部互相学习、取长补短，进一步提高工作能力和改进领导作风。县级机关下到南阳公社的一百二十多个干部，经过锻炼后，现在许多人都已成了“一专多能”的多面手，能独立负责全面工作了。
