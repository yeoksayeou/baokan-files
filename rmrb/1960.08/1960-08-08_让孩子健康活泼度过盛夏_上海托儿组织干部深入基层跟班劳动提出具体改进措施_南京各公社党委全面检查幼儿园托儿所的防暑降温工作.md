Shanghai Nursery Organization Cadres Go Deep into Basic Levels for On-the-Job Labor, Proposing Specific Improvement Measures; Nanjing Municipal People's Commune Party Committees Comprehensively Inspect the Summer Heat Prevention and Cooling Work of Kindergartens and Nurseries

    (Based on our report) Shanghai's street Party committees are vigorously focusing on summer heat prevention, cooling, and summer hygiene work in neighborhood nursery organizations, adopting various measures to ensure children spend the hot summer healthily and vibrantly.

    Since this spring, Shanghai's nursery organizations have seen rapid development. According to statistics, there are now more than 3,200 nurseries and kindergartens run by neighborhoods alone, accommodating over 377,000 children, nearly double the number at the end of 1959. Most of the newly established nursery organizations are set up simply and economically, and the childcare workers lack experience in summer heat prevention and cooling. At the same time, Shanghai's weather is hot this summer. Therefore, the street Party committees attach great importance to the summer heat prevention and cooling work of neighborhood nursery organizations, believing that doing this work well, and enabling children to spend the summer well in collective life, is an important part of the current rectification, consolidation, and improvement of nursery organizations.

    To do this work well, street Party committees frequently organize relevant cadres to conduct inspections of nurseries and kindergartens, and solve problems immediately upon discovery. Party committee secretaries in Nanshi District personally take charge, organizing relevant personnel to conduct comprehensive inspections of nurseries and kindergartens, and organizing nursery work cadres to go deep into basic levels, dividing up responsibilities and working alongside the staff. As a result, problems existing in nurseries (kindergartens) are quickly resolved. This district has adjusted more than 200 rooms that were too small or too hot in nurseries and kindergartens, and has opened windows and doors in houses with poor ventilation. The Sichuan South Road Street Party Committee actively collaborated with three middle schools and the Children's Palace in the area. These units vacated some empty houses and classrooms temporarily not in use during the summer vacation for neighborhood nurseries (kindergartens) to use for the summer, solving the problem of overcrowding for more than 600 children. Many street Party committees also stipulate that each nursery (kindergarten) should report the indoor temperature from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM each day to the Party committee, and take immediate measures if the temperature is too high. Some street Party committees even gave their offices to the nursery children to live in, and gave the office electric fans to nurseries with poor ventilation.

    Under the leadership of the street Party committees, the childcare workers of various nurseries and kindergartens have created many homemade fans, homemade showers, and other summer heat prevention and cooling equipment, bathing the children, providing them with cool drinks and cool soups, so that they can spend the summer coolly and comfortably. Nurseries (kindergartens) in the Nanjing West Road area ensure that every class has a homemade fan, every child in the large class has a fan, bathe on time, and always have cool tea. The childcare workers of the Baoshan Lane Nursery used bricks taken from windows to build a shower pool, allowing the children to shower with homemade showerheads. They also prepared a variety of cool drinks such as mint tea and barley tea for the children.

    In order to do a good job in children's health care and prevent infectious diseases, many nurseries and kindergartens have established a morning check-up system, where every child must be checked upon entering the kindergarten in the morning, and strictly disinfect eating utensils and towels, and educate children on summer hygiene. Many nurseries (kindergartens) also publicize summer hygiene knowledge to parents, so that they do not feed their children unclean things to prevent the occurrence of diseases.

    The work of nurseries and kindergartens is heavy in the summer. In response to this situation, the street Party committees, while leading and doing a good job in summer heat prevention and cooling, also focus on the problem of combining work and rest for the staff of nurseries (kindergartens), so that there is both work and rest. After the Tianshan Street Party Committee of Changning District organized cadres to conduct idealistic discussions, making everyone realize the importance of doing a good job in caring for people, the work of the nurseries (kindergartens) was properly arranged, labor was rationally organized, and manpower was increased when the nursery was busy and decreased when it was idle, with staggered shifts. Through this arrangement, the staff's study and rest time are guaranteed.

    Because the summer heat prevention, cooling, and summer hygiene work of the nurseries and kindergartens are well done, many children in the nurseries (kindergartens) not only did not lose weight in the summer, but gained weight instead. The children in Zhengjia Lane Nursery gained an average of half a catty per person in one month. The incidence of illness among children has also been greatly reduced. For more than a year, the Julu Road Third Nursery has not had any infectious diseases such as enteritis, dysentery, or mumps. According to investigations, the incidence of illness among children in nurseries and kindergartens is much lower than that of children living at home. Many parents praise the nurseries (kindergartens) for being well-run.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 6th. Party committees of various people's communes in Nanjing organized relevant departments to conduct a major inspection of kindergartens and nurseries throughout the city, focusing on safety and hygiene, summer heat prevention and cooling, to ensure that more than 90,000 children in care can spend the hot summer happily.

Through the major inspection, each commune first adopted various measures to improve the housing conditions of kindergartens and nurseries. Sun-exposed houses were generally covered with sunshades and bamboo curtains, and windows were added to houses with insufficient ventilation. Many factories and enterprises gave their offices or other houses with better conditions to kindergartens. The Xinghuo Cotton Weaving Factory of Jianye Commune gave the coolest workshop to the infant class of the kindergarten. Each commune also took advantage of the summer vacation of middle and primary schools to allow kindergartens and nurseries with poor housing conditions to move there for the summer.

In terms of summer heat prevention and cooling, many kindergartens and nurseries have created many economical and cooling equipment in the spirit of running childcare undertakings diligently and thriftily. Half of the kindergartens and nurseries in Xuanwu Commune make their own homemade fans. The Dasha Mao Lane Kindergarten puts well water in the children's activity room to cool it down. Some kindergartens and nurseries have adopted methods such as frequently mopping the floor to cool down, which have all worked well.

In addition to preparing a large amount of warm boiled water and salt boiled water for the children to quench their thirst, many nurseries also prepare honeysuckle dew, licorice water, mung bean soup, winter melon soup, tomato juice, and other cool drinks for the children to relieve the heat. The children's personal hygiene and dietary hygiene have also been further improved after inspection. In addition to the fixed morning hygiene check-up every day, many kindergartens and nurseries use homemade showers to bathe the children twice a day. Many kindergartens have made running water hand washers, which are both hygienic and labor-saving.

After this major inspection, many kindergartens and nurseries have formulated conventions for safely spending the summer or summer hygiene and health care systems. (Attached picture)

    让孩子健康活泼度过盛夏
    上海托儿组织干部深入基层跟班劳动提出具体改进措施  南京各公社党委全面检查幼儿园托儿所的防暑降温工作
    本报讯　上海市各街道党委大抓里弄托儿组织的防暑降温和夏令卫生工作，采取各种措施，让孩子们健康活泼地过好炎热的夏天。
    今春以来，上海托儿组织有了飞跃发展。据统计，现在仅里弄举办的托儿所、幼儿园就有三千二百多所，收托儿童达三十七万七千多，比1959年年底增加了近两倍。新建托儿组织大多是因陋就简办起来的，保育工作人员又缺乏防暑降温的经验；同时，今年夏季上海天气炎热，因此各街道党委十分重视里弄托儿组织的防暑降温工作，认为搞好这一工作，使孩子们在集体生活中过好夏天，是当前托儿组织整顿、巩固、提高的重要环节。
    为了作好这一工作，各街道党委经常组织有关干部深入托儿所、幼儿园进行检查，发现问题立即解决。南市区各街道党委书记亲自挂帅，组织有关方面人员对托儿所、幼儿园进行全面检查，组织托儿工作干部深入基层，分块包干，跟班劳动。这样一来，托儿所（园）存在的问题很快得到解决。这个区对托儿所、幼儿园房屋过小、温度较高的都作了调整，全区已调整了二百多间；对通风设备差的房屋开了窗门。四川南路街道党委与地区内的三个中学和少年宫等单位大搞协作，这些单位都腾出了一些空房子和暑假中暂时不用的教室借给里弄托儿所（园）过夏，解决了六百多个孩子住房拥挤问题。许多街道党委还规定每个托儿所（园）都要向党委汇报当天下午一时到三时的室内温度，温度过高时立即采取措施。有的街道党委还把自己的办公室让给托儿所孩子们住，把办公室的电风扇送给通风条件较差的托儿所用。
    各托儿所、幼儿园的保育工作人员，在街道党委领导下，制造了许多土风扇、土淋浴等防暑降温设备，给孩子们洗澡、饮清凉饮料、凉汤，使他们过得凉快舒适。南京西路地区的托儿所（园），做到班班有土风扇，大班小孩个个有扇子，按时洗澡，随时有凉茶。宝山里托儿所的保育员们用开窗户拆下来的砖头砌了一个淋浴池，让孩子们用土制莲蓬头淋浴。她们还为孩子们准备了薄荷茶、大麦茶等多种清凉饮料。
    为了做好儿童保健工作和防治传染病，许多托儿所、幼儿园都建立了晨间检查的制度，每个孩子早上入园时都要经过检查，并且严格做好食具、手巾的消毒工作，向孩子进行夏令卫生的教育。不少托儿所（园）还对幼儿家长宣传夏令卫生常识，使他们不给孩子吃不清洁的东西，防止疾病发生。
    夏季托儿所、幼儿园的工作繁重，针对这种情况，街道党委在领导搞好防暑降温工作的同时，又大抓托儿所（园）工作人员的劳逸结合问题，做到有劳有逸。长宁区天山街道党委组织干部务虚、讨论，使大家认识到做好关心人的工作的重要性以后，对托儿所（园）的工作进行了妥善安排，合理组织劳动力，根据托儿所忙闲规律，做到忙时人多，闲时人少，交叉上班。通过这样安排，工作人员的学习和休息时间都得到保证。
    由于托儿所、幼儿园防暑降温和夏令卫生工作做得好，许多托儿所（园）的孩子们在夏天不但没有减轻体重，反而增加了体重。郑家巷托儿所的孩子，在一个月内体重平均每人增加了半斤。孩子的发病率也大大降低。巨鹿路第三托儿所一年多来，一直没有发生过肠炎、菌痢、腮腺炎等传染病。据调查，托儿所、幼儿园孩子的发病率要比散居儿童低得多。许多家长都称赞托儿所（园）办得好。
    新华社南京6日电　南京市各人民公社党委，组织有关部门对全市幼儿园和托儿所进行了以安全卫生、防暑降温为中心的大检查，保证九万多名受托儿童愉快地度过炎夏。
    通过大检查，各公社首先采取各项措施，改善幼儿园和托儿所的房屋条件。太阳晒的房子普遍搭了凉棚，挂上竹帘，通风不足的房子增开了窗子。不少工厂和企业单位把办公室或其它条件较好的房子让给幼儿园。建业公社星火棉织厂把最凉快的车间让给幼儿园婴儿班。各公社还利用中、小学放暑假的空隙，让房屋条件较差的幼儿园和托儿所搬过去度暑。
    在防暑降温方面，许多幼儿园和托儿所根据勤俭办保育事业的精神，创造了很多既经济又降温的设备。玄武公社有二分之一的幼儿园和托儿所自制土风扇。大沙帽巷幼儿园打井水放在儿童活动室里降温。有些园、所采取勤拖地板等办法降温，效果都很好。
    很多托儿所除了准备大量温开水、盐开水给孩子解渴以外，还准备了金银花露、甘草水、绿豆汤、冬瓜汤、番茄汁等各种清凉饮料，给孩子们消暑。孩子们的个人卫生和饮食卫生经过检查也都有了进一步改善。除了每天固定的晨间卫生检查外，不少幼儿园和托儿所采用土淋浴的办法，每天给孩子洗两次澡。很多幼儿园做了活水洗手器，既卫生又节省人力。
    经过这次大检查，不少幼儿园和托儿所订出了安全过夏的公约，或夏令卫生保健制度。（附图片）
