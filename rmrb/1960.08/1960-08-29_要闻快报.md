    Qinghai Strengthens Field Management of Autumn Crops
    People of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province are strengthening field management of newly cultivated land and late-maturing crops, striving for increased autumn grain production.
    Based on the characteristics of the changeable plateau climate in August and September, all people's communes, while focusing on fertilizing, weeding, and watering newly cultivated land and late-maturing crops, are universally paying attention to frost, hail, and flood prevention.  Members of the people's communes in the Mutual Aid Tu Autonomous County have researched and summarized their past experiences in preventing hail, establishing more than 150 hail prevention outposts. Recently, the county has continuously overcome eighteen hail storms, allowing crops to grow normally.
    
    Gansu Focuses on Feed to Enhance Livestock Strength
    Gansu is seizing the current favorable season of abundant water and grass to focus on fattening livestock for autumn, preparing strong draught animals for the "Three Autumns" work.
    Resolving the contradiction between labor service and feeding during the busy season is an important measure in Gansu's effort to fatten livestock this year.  A complete set of livestock feeding systems has been universally established throughout the province, and many areas have also established livestock file cards.
    While focusing on fattening livestock, various areas are also adopting methods such as planting, harvesting, and processing to expand feed sources in every possible way, preparing sufficient livestock feed for the "Three Autumns" busy season and this winter and next spring.
    
    Inner Mongolia and Jilin Strengthen Sugar Beet Management
    Sugar beet producing areas in Inner Mongolia and Jilin are focusing on the late-stage management of sugar beets, striving to provide more and better sugar-making raw materials for light industry.
    Currently, sugar beets have entered the growth stage of root enlargement and sugar accumulation. In order to strengthen the late-stage management of sugar beets, the Economic Crop Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Department of Agriculture held an on-site meeting in the Taohua People's Commune of the Tumote Banner, summarizing and promoting the commune's specific experience in weeding, cultivating, watering, topdressing, deep hoeing to conserve moisture, and plant protection for sugar beets. Cadres and members of all levels in the Qian Gorlos Mongolian Autonomous County in Jilin Province joined forces in the fields to conduct a comprehensive inspection of sugar beets throughout the county. Through ranking and classification, they launched a surge of field management to further improve first-class seedlings and promote the upgrading of second- and third-class seedlings.

    Xinjiang Shache County Universally Establishes Seed Bases
    The Shache County Party Committee in Xinjiang is focusing on fine seed breeding, solving a key problem in the local development of agricultural production. The fine seed bases established throughout the county now account for more than 10% of the total annual sowing area, and the fine seeds bred can meet the needs of the county's autumn sowing and next year's spring planting. The Ukrainian "Eighty-Three" fine wheat variety, which has been carefully selected after harvesting by various communes, can meet the needs of autumn sowing for more than 500,000 mu of winter wheat.
    In order to ensure that the excellent varieties do not become mixed during the large-scale breeding process and that the purity of the seeds reaches the first-class standard, strict management systems have been established at all levels. Each commune has assigned experienced members to specifically manage the seed fields.
