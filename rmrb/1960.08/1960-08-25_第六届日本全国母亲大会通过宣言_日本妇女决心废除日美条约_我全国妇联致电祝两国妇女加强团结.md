Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: The Sixth National Mothers' Congress of Japan, which opened on the 21st, successfully concluded in Tokyo on the 23rd.

More than 13,000 representatives from all over Japan participated in the meeting. Women representatives from Cuba, West Germany, Austria, and the United States, who were attending the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Total Disarmament, were invited to attend the congress.

During the three-day meeting, the representatives held group discussions on various agenda items, including the issue of opposing the (Japan-U.S.) "Security Treaty," education issues, social security and mothers' issues, issues related to the political system and safeguarding the economic interests of mothers and children, and issues related to the mothers' peace movement.

After heated discussions, the representatives agreed that to achieve true peace, the most important thing is to shatter the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" system and to wage unremitting struggle against arms expansion and war preparations.

At the closing plenary session on the 23rd, the representatives passed a declaration announcing that the focus of their future struggle is to smash the "Security Treaty system" and abolish the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The congress passed eighteen resolutions. These include: demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and Japan and North Korea; opposing Japan's nuclear armament; striving for the complete withdrawal of U.S. military bases stationed in Japan; demanding the return of Okinawa to Japan; striving for complete disarmament; opposing trade "liberalization"; supporting the struggle of the Miike coal mine workers; opposing the illegal suppression of patriots who participated in the struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," etc.

The famous female commentator, Yoko Matsuoka, spoke at the meeting. Matsuoka pointed out that peace can only be achieved through resolute struggle against those who destroy peace. She called on mothers to fight against Japanese militarism colluding with foreign countries and to strive to develop the Japanese mothers' movement into a large-scale movement.

Iku Yasui, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and Kozo Minakuchi, Secretary-General of the National Council to Stop the Revision of the "Security Treaty," both addressed the meeting. Yasui Iku called on mothers to strengthen their confidence in victory and continue the struggle.

After the congress, the mothers who attended the congress divided into two groups and held demonstrations.

Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd, Tokyo Dispatch: A congratulatory message from the All-China Women's Federation to the congress was read out at the National Mothers' Congress of Japan today. The congratulatory message warmly congratulated the success of the National Mothers' Congress of Japan.

The congratulatory message said: "In the past year or so, the Japanese people and women have launched large-scale national struggles against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and against the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, achieving great victories. They have seriously attacked the US imperialist attempt to push the Japanese people into the abyss of new war disasters and plot new wars, and have made important contributions to defending peace in Asia and the world. In the ranks of the heroic struggle of the Japanese people, thousands of Japanese women and mothers, shouting 'Abolish the Security Treaty,' 'Cancel U.S. military bases,' 'Don't let our children, husbands, and relatives be thrown into war again,' are moving forward actively and bravely in neat steps, showing their strong and unyielding heroic spirit. We Chinese women express our heartfelt respect for this and warmly congratulate you on the great victories you have already achieved in the struggle!"

The congratulatory message said: "We have always regarded the struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialist aggression and against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty as support for the Chinese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and as a common struggle between the Chinese and Japanese people. Chinese women care for every action of the Japanese people and women in their just struggle with deep sisterly feelings, and rejoice for every victory you have achieved. The struggle of the Japanese people has the support of 650 million Chinese people and all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world. The heroic struggle of the Japanese people and women has had a profound impact on the world. We believe that with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world, the Japanese people will completely crush the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and the Japanese people's desire for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality will surely be realized, and the final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people."

The congratulatory message said: "Let the people and women of China and Japan unite more closely, support each other, fight together, and struggle to the end for the friendship between the people of China and Japan, for the common cause of opposing our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and for defending peace in Asia and the world."
