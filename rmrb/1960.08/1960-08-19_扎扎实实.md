    Solid and Practical
    Bai Cang
    Comrade Wang Boya, Party Branch Secretary of the Fuxing Management Area of the Wangji People's Commune in Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, went deep into a backward team and settled down. In one year, he transformed the backward team into an advanced one. How did Comrade Wang Boya work in the backward team? He cultivated and transformed 94 mu of backward land together with seven poor peasants. Regardless of the freezing cold or the scorching heat, regardless of wind or rain, he always ate, lived, worked, and consulted with the commune members. Comrade Wang Boya also set a "condition" for himself in his work, which he called "three things to bring when going out—farming tools, manure baskets, and a labor record book; three things to have when coming in—wild manure, work points, and feedback from commune members." Relying on these "three brings and three has," he went deep among the masses, understood many situations, and solved many problems in his work.
    Under the education of the Party, many grassroots cadres of our Party have cultivated a solid and practical fine work style like that of Comrade Wang Boya. They completely lack the boastful, loud, and flashy style. The victory of the socialist cause can only be achieved through solid work. Every task that every cadre does for the Party in a solid and practical manner advances the socialist construction cause in a solid and practical manner. Every solid and practical problem they solve lays a solid and practical brick for the socialist edifice.
    Throughout our entire revolutionary course, countless loyal and reliable Communist Party members have worked diligently and practically in various positions, dedicating their utmost strength to the revolution. Today, the arduous task of our socialist construction cause relies on today's outstanding Party cadres to undertake it in a solid and practical manner. On the one hand, they establish lofty aspirations and, with the spirit of swallowing mountains and rivers, face the Party's arduous tasks with full confidence; on the other hand, they approach every task in the socialist construction cause in a solid and practical manner, doing it carefully and well, and ensuring the victorious realization of every socialist construction task.

    扎扎实实
    白沧
    湖北省新洲县汪集人民公社复兴管理区党总支书记汪波伢同志，深入到一个落后小队里落户，在一年的时间里，叫这个落后小队面貌改观，转变成了一个先进队。汪波伢同志在落后队怎样工作呢？他和七个贫农一起耕种和改造了九十四亩落后田。他不管寒天冷冻，不管炎天暑热，不管刮风下雨，总是和社员们同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。汪波伢同志还给自己规定了一个做工作的“条件”，叫做出门三带——带农具，带粪筐，带劳动手册；进门三有——有野粪，有工分，有社员反映的情况。他凭着这个“三带三有”，深入群众，了解了许多情况，解决了工作中的许多问题。
    我们党的许多基层干部，在党的教育下，培养起了像汪波伢同志这样的扎扎实实的优良作风。他们完全没有那种夸夸其谈，大嚷大叫，华而不实的作风。社会主义事业的胜利是要靠扎扎实实的工作才能得来的。每个干部扎扎实实为党作的每项工作，都使社会主义建设事业扎扎实实地前进一步，他们解决的一个一个扎扎实实的问题，都给社会主义大厦砌上了一块扎扎实实的砖头。
    在我们整个革命历程中，多少忠诚可靠的共产党员，在各个岗位上扎扎实实地辛勤工作，对革命付出了最大的力量。今天，我们社会主义建设事业的艰巨任务，就靠今天的党的优秀干部扎扎实实承担起来。他们一方面树立雄心大志，以气吞山河的气概，满怀信心来迎接党的艰巨任务；另一方面，他们对待社会主义建设事业中的每项工作，都扎扎实实地去作，仔细地去作，把每项工作都作好，保证每一个社会主义建设任务的胜利实现。
