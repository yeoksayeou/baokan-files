Transfer More Labor to Field Production
    Boost Enthusiasm, Add Measures, Manage Autumn Fields
    Sichuan Launches Autumn Field Management Competition
    (Xinhua News Agency) Sichuan Province is focusing on autumn field management, striving to increase grain yield by dozens of catties per mu through doubled meticulous management. The enthusiastic field management competition launched by the masses in various places has created a scene of catching up with each other and striving for advancement throughout the province. Dazhou, Nanchong and other regions have widely launched the "catch up" and "surpass" competition of low-yield catching up with high-yield, third-class seedlings catching up with first-class seedlings, and ordinary fields catching up with high-yield fields. There are pacesetters at all levels from the region, county to the commune, and large-scale chain competitions and rival competitions are carried out in districts and regions. In the rival competition between the Gonghe Management Area and the Xikou Management Area of the Puxi Commune in Kaixian County, the Xikou Management Area took the lead at first, weeding and fertilizing 400 mu of rice paddies once in two days; the Gonghe Management Area immediately formed a commando team led by the branch secretary, and cultivated and fertilized all the rice fields once in a few days, catching up with Xikou.
    Leading cadres at all levels in the province go deep into the front line, stand in front of the competition movement, eat, live, work and discuss with the masses, and promote the balanced development of the movement. In Nanchong Prefecture, more than 1,000 cadres at all levels have settled in areas with more third-class seedlings. They study problems with the masses, and the third-class seedlings in these places have been rapidly upgraded. The Suining County Party Committee recently sent five secretaries and five members of the county party committee to strengthen leadership in backward communes and teams. After nine days of shock work, the third-class seedlings in the county have been generally upgraded.
    This year, the planting area of ​​spring crops in Sichuan has increased a lot compared with last year. Due to the tight field management from the beginning, coupled with the even distribution of rain in most areas, the growth is generally good. At present, middle rice and middle corn in the province have been grouting and solidifying, sweet potatoes have entered the second fertilization and weeding stage, and late rice, autumn sweet potatoes, and autumn corn have also generally achieved planting and management. Due to the large area and high yield of spring crops, and the long management time of many crops, the potential for increased production is very large. Therefore, under the call of the Provincial Party Committee, the people of the province regard strengthening field management as the primary measure to strive for more grain in autumn.
    At present, the autumn field management, early autumn harvest, and late autumn planting in rural Sichuan are intertwined. In order to concentrate efforts on the main offensive direction, all localities have invested more than 70% of the first-line labor force in field management, and at the same time adopted the method of combining separate operations and concentrated assaults to ensure sufficient labor for field management.
    Hebei Strengthens Measures to Promote Vine and Tuber Growth of Sweet Potatoes
    (Xinhua News Agency) People's communes in various parts of Hebei Province are grasping sweet potato field management and fully launching hoeing and fertilizing activities centered on promoting vine and tuber growth.
    Party committees at all levels in Hebei Province are led by secretaries at all levels to strengthen the leadership of sweet potato production. In order to win a bumper harvest of sweet potatoes, the broad masses of cadres and commune members throughout the province conscientiously analyzed the favorable and unfavorable conditions for sweet potato growth this year, and tried every means to improve the level of sweet potato management. All localities have adopted the method of combining cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians to summarize experience and formulate management measures according to the sweet potato growth in various places. Ding County, which is rich in sweet potatoes, has formulated management measures such as grasping high yield, promoting upgrading, and comprehensively ensuring a bumper harvest: “supplying (seedlings), fertilizing, watering, weeding, cultivating (soil), digging (capillary roots), and drying (ridges),” which greatly improved the level of field management.
    In the spirit of combining multiple planting and multiple harvests with high yield and multiple harvests, we must firmly grasp the production guarantee fields and vigorously attack third-class seedlings. All localities in the province have carefully managed and added measures to the 60% of the sweet potato area that is used to guarantee production, requiring one mu of yield to top two mu. Nangong, Julu and other counties have established management archives for each production guarantee field to make field management more scientific and meticulous. While grasping the high-yield plots, Xinle County determined 210 secretaries of communes, management areas and production teams to lead more than 4,000 commune members to contract for the management of more than 30,000 mu of third-class seedlings with poor soil quality, so that they can be upgraded regularly and catch up with first-class fields.
    In grasping field management measures, most areas of the province have promoted a series of production responsibility systems and evaluation systems such as output to the team, contract work to the group, and responsibility to the individual, which greatly accelerated the progress of sweet potato management.
    Inner Mongolia Manages Rice Carefully
    (Xinhua News Agency) Agricultural areas in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are generally strengthening rice field management in an effort to achieve a bumper autumn harvest. The rice planting area in the Autonomous Region this year has expanded compared with last year. In order to manage rice well and strive for a bumper harvest in autumn, all localities have launched a movement to completely eliminate third-class seedlings and strive to upgrade seedlings in general, on the basis of weeding and fertilizing once or twice. In the Hetao Plain, which has the largest rice area, some commune party committee secretaries contract by area to help small teams rationally arrange labor to form professional teams, and carry out management competitions through "ten checks and ten comparisons," such as checking channels to compare smoothness, and checking topdressing and weeding to compare quality. The party committee secretary of Bayantala Commune in Wuyuan County immediately convened an on-site meeting of production team leaders and rice management personnel in response to the problems found during the inspection, and increased measures to enable all 30,000 mu of rice in the commune to be drained and irrigated, and most of the second and third-class seedlings were generally upgraded.
    Beijing Launches Autumn Grain Overproduction Campaign
    (Xinhua News Agency) The suburbs of Beijing are launching an autumn grain overproduction campaign. At present, more than 2 million rural people's commune members and labor forces supporting agriculture from all sides are fighting in the fields, grasping the late-stage field management of autumn grain crops, and striving to harvest more grain in autumn.
    Since entering July, the suburbs of Beijing have successively launched three major shock campaigns to rush to plant late autumn crops, weed and eliminate wasteland, and plant autumn vegetables in large quantities, and completed the grain and vegetable planting plan. There is still nearly a month before the harvest time of early autumn grain crops, and there are still two months before late autumn crops are harvested. During this period, strengthening field management and striving for overproduction is still promising. To this end, many counties and districts in the suburbs have seized the time to carry out general investigation and calculation activities, conducted on-the-spot inspections of crop growth, classified and ranked them, and calculated the time, labor, transportation capacity, fertilizer, and pesticides, and concentrated human and material resources to increase management measures. Overproduction goals have been put forward, setting off a vigorous overproduction competition. Some communes and communes, brigades and brigades, and production teams and production teams have organized rival competitions, constantly sending people to learn from each other and promote each other.
    In the overproduction movement, all localities paid special attention to grasping the field management of high-yield crops. This year, the four high-yield crops of corn, sweet potatoes, rice, and multi-spike sorghum planted in the suburbs of Beijing account for about 70% of the total grain area. Ensuring a bumper harvest of these crops is the decisive key to achieving grain overproduction. All communes are now strengthening the professional management teams of these crops in accordance with the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, implementing increased production measures, and managing them well.
    When leading the overproduction movement, party organizations at all levels continue to transfer cadres to strengthen the front line, and pay special attention to grasping both ends - high-yield plots, high-yield teams and third-class seedlings, and backward teams. Shunyi, Huairou and other four counties have promptly transferred more than 700 cadres to strengthen the leadership of production teams.

    调出更多的劳动力投入田间生产
    鼓干劲　加措施　管理秋田
    四川开展秋田管理竞赛
    据新华社讯　四川省大抓秋田管理，力争通过加倍精细管理使每亩秋田多产几十斤粮食。各地群众开展的热烈的田间管理竞赛，使全省出现一片你追我赶争先跃进的景象。达县、南充等专区广泛开展了低产赶高产、三类苗赶一类苗、一般田赶高产田的“赶”、“超”竞赛，从专区、县到公社层层有标兵，分区分片大搞连环赛、对手赛。开县铺溪公社共和管理区和溪口管理区在对手赛中，最初溪口管理区一马当先，两天就把四百亩水稻除草、追肥各一次；共和管理区马上就由支部书记挂帅，组成突击队，几天就把全部稻田中耕追肥一次，赶上了溪口。
    全省各级领导干革命深入到第一线，站在竞赛运动的前面，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，促进运动平衡发展。南充专区各级干部到三类苗较多的地区落户驻守的就达一千多人，他们和群众一起研究问题，使这些地方的三类苗迅速升级。中共遂宁县委最近派出五个书记和五个县委委员深入后进社、队加强领导，经过九天突击，全县的三类苗便普遍升级。
    四川今年大春作物播种面积比去年增加很多，由于一开始就抓紧了田间管理，加上大部地区雨水调匀，生长普遍良好。目前，全省中稻和中玉米已灌浆结实，红薯大部进入第二次追肥除草，晚稻、秋红薯、秋玉米等也都普遍做到了随种随管。由于大春作物面积大，产量高，许多作物管理时间尚长，增产潜力很大，所以全省人民在省委的号召下，把加强田间管理作为争取秋季多收粮食的首要措施。
    当前四川农村秋田管理和收早秋、种晚秋三方面农活交错。为了集中力量抓主攻方向，各地都把第一线劳力的70％以上投入了田间管理，同时采取分线作战和集中突击相结合的办法，保证田间管理有足够的劳力。
    河北加强措施为甘薯催蔓攻块
    据新华社讯　河北省各地人民公社狠抓甘薯田间管理，全面展开了以催蔓、攻块为中心的甘薯中耕、追肥活动。
    河北省各地党委层层书记挂帅，加强了甘薯生产的领导。为了夺取甘薯丰收，全省广大干部和社员认真分析今年甘薯生长有利条件和不利条件，千方百计提高甘薯管理水平。各地采取干部、老农、技术员三结合的方法，总经经验，并根据各地甘薯生长情况，制订管理措施。盛产甘薯的定县，制订出抓高产、促升级，全面保丰收的“补（苗）、追（肥）、浇（水）、锄（草）、培（土）、挖（毛根）、晒（埂）”等管理措施，使田间管理水平大大提高。
    各地本着多种多收和高产多收相结合的精神，狠抓保产田，猛攻三类苗。全省各地对于占甘薯总面积的60％的保产田，细管理，加措施，要求一亩产量顶二亩。南宫、巨鹿等县为每块保产田建立了管理档案，使田间管理更加科学、细致。新乐县在狠抓丰产方的同时，确定了二百一十名公社、管理区和生产队书记，带领四千多名社员，分块包干管理三万多亩土质不好的三类苗，使它定期升级，赶上一类田。
    在狠抓田间管理措施中，全省大部地区推行了产量到队、包工到组、责任到人和一系列的生产责任制和评比制度，大大加快了甘薯管理进度。
    内蒙古细管水稻
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区农业地区，普遍加强稻田管理工作，力争秋粮丰收。自治区今年水稻播种面积比去年扩大。各地为把水稻管好，力争秋季丰收，在普遍拔草、追肥一两遍的基础上，又展开了彻底消灭三类苗、力争禾苗普遍升级的运动。在水稻面积最大的河套平原，有些公社党委书记分片包干，帮助小队合理安排劳力组成专业队，通过查渠道比畅通、查追肥拔草比质量等“十查十比”开展管理竞赛。五原县巴彦特拉公社党委书记针对检查中发现的问题，随即召开生产队长和水稻管理人员现场会，增加措施，使全社三万多亩水稻全部实现了有排有灌，大部分二、三类苗普遍升了级。
    北京市开展秋粮超产运动
    据新华社讯　北京市郊区正在开展秋粮超产运动。目前二百多万农村人民公社社员和各方面支援农业的劳力，正在田间奋战，狠抓秋收粮食作物后期田间管理，力争在秋季多收粮食。
    进人7月以来，北京郊区连续发动了抢种晚秋作物、锄草灭荒和大种秋菜的三大突击战役，完成了粮菜播种计划。现在离早秋粮食作物收获时间还有将近一个月，晚秋作物还有两月才收。在这段时间内，加强田间管理，争取超产还大有可为。为此，郊区很多县区抓紧时机普遍进行了查、算活动，对作物生长情况进行实地检查，分类排队，并且计算时间，计算劳力、运力、肥料、农药，集中人力物力增加管理措施。提出了超产目标，掀起了热火朝天的超产竞赛。有些公社与公社，大队与大队，生产队与生产队之间组织了对手赛，不断派人互相学习互相促进。
    在超产运动中，各地特别注意抓紧高产作物的田间管理。今年北京郊区种植的玉米、白薯、水稻、多穗高粱等四种高产作物，约占全部粮田面积70％左右，保证这些作物丰收是实现粮食超产的决定关键。各公社现在正按照中共北京市委的指示加强这几项作物的专业管理队伍，落实增产措施，全力管好。
    各级党组织在领导超产运动时，继续抽调干部加强第一线，并且特别注意抓两头—丰产方、高产队和三类苗、后进队。顺义、怀柔等四个县已经及时抽调了七百多名干部加强生产队的领导。
