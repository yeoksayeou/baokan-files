    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 7th: The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Council of Ministers recently made a resolution on improving construction work, demanding accelerated construction speed, improved project quality, and adapting the construction industry to the needs of the country's socialist construction development.
    The resolution pointed out that during the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), the state will build a large number of new factories and residences. The resolution requires construction departments to formulate long-term construction plans, improve operating methods, adopt advanced experiences, improve the methods of making engineering drawings, and vigorously train cadres.
    In order to rapidly develop local construction undertakings, the resolution requires that local construction departments be directly led by the provincial governments.
    The resolution pointed out that in order to meet the residents' need for housing, the architectural design department should formulate a construction plan to ensure an average of nine square meters of housing space per person by 1970, and formulate a plan for future ten to fifteen years to ensure an average of twelve square meters of housing space per person. In addition, multi-story buildings should be designed and constructed in Ulaanbaatar.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th: According to reports in the local press: The Soviet Union is vigorously developing the extremely rich iron ore resources in the world-famous Kursk Magnetic Anomaly region.
    It is estimated that by the end of the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965), this iron ore area will be able to mine 36 million tons of iron ore annually; and by 1980, it will mine 60 million tons, which is equal to the total annual output of all iron ore mines in the United States today.
    The first mining enterprise in this region—the Mikhailovsky open-pit mine—was put into production not long ago.
    The Kursk Magnetic Anomaly area is 200 kilometers wide and 700 kilometers long. Currently, 30 billion tons of iron ore with an iron content of 60% have been explored there. It is estimated that the total prospective reserves of rich and poor ores in this region reach 200 billion tons. At the beginning of 1960, the total proven reserves of iron ore in all capitalist countries were only 40 billion tons.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 11th: Czechoslovak workers are extensively launching a technical revolution movement in industry, especially in the machinery manufacturing industry.
    In the heavy machinery manufacturing industry, workers put forward a total of 25,390 innovation proposals in the first half of this year, an increase of more than 14% over the same period last year. Among them, 1,372 have been adopted for production, saving the country more than 96 million crowns in funds.
    Currently, 15,000 workers in 110 machine manufacturing factories in Czechoslovakia have launched a technical revolution competition. Due to technological progress, the workers in these factories can save an average of 412,000 work hours and 1,476 tons of metal, as well as large amounts of coal and coke, every month; they save the country 16 million crowns in production costs every month.
    The socialist attitude of workers towards work is an endless source of technical revolution. Taking the lead in the technical revolution movement are production teams participating in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team." Currently, there are 22,000 such production teams across the country.

    蒙古党和政府就建筑工作通过决议
    要求加快建筑速度提高工程质量
    苏联开发库尔斯克铁矿　捷工人开展技术革命运动
    新华社乌兰巴托7日电　蒙古人民革命党中央委员会和部长会议最近作出了关于改进建筑工作的决议，要求加快建筑速度，提高工程质量，使建筑事业适应国家社会主义建设发展的需要。
    决议指出，在第三个五年计划（1961—1965）期间，国家将要新建大批工厂和住宅。决议要求建筑部门制定长远的建筑规划，改进操作方法，采用先进经验，改进工程图纸的制作方法，并大力培养干部。
    为了迅速发展地方建筑事业，决议要求把地方建筑部门交由省政府直接领导。
    决议指出，为了满足居民对住宅的需要，建筑设计部门应制定到1970年平均每人占有住宅九平方米的建筑计划，并制定今后十至十五年内每人可占十二平方米面积的住宅的计划。此外，还应设计在乌兰巴托市建筑多层楼房。
    新华社莫斯科9日电　据此间报纸报道：苏联正在大力开发世界著名的库尔斯克地磁异常区的极其丰富的铁矿资源。
    据计算，到七年计划（1959—1965年）结束时，这一铁矿区每年就可以开采三千六百万吨铁矿砂；而到1980年将开采六千万吨，即等于美国目前所有铁矿年产量的总和。
    这个地区的第一个采矿企业——米哈伊洛夫斯克露天采矿场已经在不久前投入生产。
    库尔斯克地磁异常区宽二百公里，长七百公里。目前，那里已经勘探出三百亿吨含铁量达60％的铁矿。据估计，这一地区的全部富矿和贫矿的远景蕴藏量达二千亿吨。而在1960年年初，各资本主义国家已经探明的铁矿的全部蕴藏量只有四百亿吨。
    新华社布拉格11日电　捷克斯洛伐克的工人正广泛地在工业中，特别是在机器制造业中展开技术革命运动。
    在重型机器制造业中，工人们在今年上半年一共提出了二万五千三百九十条革新建议，比去年同时期增加了14％以上。其中已有一千三百七十二条被采用于生产，为国家节约了九千六百多万克朗的资金。
    目前，捷克斯洛伐克已有一百一十个机器制造厂的一万五千名工人展开了技术革命的竞赛运动。由于技术进步，这些工厂的工人平均每月可以节省四十一万二千个工时和一千四百七十六吨金属以及大量的煤和焦炭；他们每个月为国家节约的生产费用达一千六百万克朗。
    工人对待工作的社会主义态度是技术革命的无穷无尽的源泉。走在技术革命运动的前面的是参加争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛的生产队。目前，全国已有二万二千个这样的生产队。
