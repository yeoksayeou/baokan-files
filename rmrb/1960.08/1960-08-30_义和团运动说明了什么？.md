What Does the Boxer Movement Illustrate?
Liu Danian

The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Boxer Movement, and the Xinhai Revolution are the culmination of three revolutionary high tides in China's old democratic period. The Boxer Movement was situated in between the preceding and following high tides. The Taiping Rebellion, a peasant war primarily against feudalism, had failed more than thirty years before, and the bourgeois Xinhai Revolution was still ten years away. The Boxer Movement emerged at just the right moment, taking the fight against imperialism as its mission, which was its distinctive feature.

Speaking only of its heyday, the Boxer Movement was very short-lived. However, its importance, its patriotic fervor, and its spirit of fighting through thick and thin, make it a worthy representative of China's national awakening and a pioneer of the anti-aggression struggle. In terms of scale, the Boxer Movement was a grand convergence of the anti-foreign religion struggles that had been rising and falling across the country for a long time. If the Hundred Days' Reform two years earlier was a step in the process of national awakening, then the Boxer Movement was a towering milestone.

Why was the Boxer Movement, which originally rose up empty-handed and ultimately failed tragically, able to be so brave and fearless, accomplishing such earth-shattering feats?

Looking at the main contradictions of Chinese society at that time, it is clear that the Boxer Movement was a product of the deepening of imperialist aggression and the unprecedented severity of the national disaster. By the time the Boxer Movement broke out, more than half a century of foreign aggression had finally pushed Chinese society into the abyss of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. The danger of the imperialist powers dividing China was imminent. Britain, France, and Japan had launched four wars of aggression in succession, forcing China to cede territory and pay huge indemnities. Nineteen countries, including Britain and the United States, had signed most-favored-nation treatment treaties and other unequal treaties with China. Foreign treaty ports were spread across forty-five cities in sixteen inland provinces and the Northeast, Tibet, and Taiwan. Seven countries, including Britain and the United States, occupied concessions in fourteen commercial ports in China. The six major coastal ports were foreign military bases. The vast majority of the railways, totaling three to four thousand kilometers nationwide, were built through foreign coercion, loans, or unauthorized construction. The vast majority of ships navigating China's inland rivers were foreign-owned. All customs revenues were mortgaged to foreign countries, and all customs commissioners were foreigners. The Chinese government owed various debts to countries such as Britain and Russia, amounting to more than 451 million taels of silver. The national treasury's annual income was only over 80 million taels, and the foreign debt could never be repaid. Vast areas of China, from Heilongjiang in the north to Yunnan and Guangdong in the south, were divided into spheres of influence by Russia, Britain, Germany, France, and Japan. The United States seized benefits everywhere under the banner of the "Open Door" policy. In addition, nearly forty Catholic and Christian dioceses, representing imperialist interests, and more than sixty churches were scattered throughout the country; about three thousand foreign missionaries were active in most towns and villages across the country, committing all kinds of evil deeds. The people felt the pressure of imperialism at all times in their daily lives and could not breathe freely. It was impossible for the Chinese people to willingly live like this for a long time, not to rise up and fight, and not to resist aggression. The Boxer Movement arose precisely from this contradiction; it was the violent eruption of this contradiction. The Boxer Movement was a patriotic movement against imperialist aggression, and the war waged by the Boxers was a war against imperialism, a revolutionary, and progressive war.

The Boxer Movement was initiated by the peasant masses; it was another peasant revolution. The basic masses who participated were primarily peasants, followed by handicraft workers, urban poor, demobilized soldiers, small merchants, and land and water transport workers. The main leaders of the movement were religious sect leaders (Zhu Hongdeng), wandering monks (Benming Monk), lower-ranking military officers (Li Laizhong), boatmen (Zhang Decheng), vagrants (Cao Futian), and itinerant performers (Huang Lian Shengmu). Chinese old-style peasant wars have always been led by these people. At that time, the bourgeois political groups included the Revive China Society and the Reform Movement. The members of the Revive China Society were petty-bourgeois intellectuals, urban petty-bourgeoisie, and overseas Chinese capitalists. The members of the Reform Movement were semi-feudal and semi-capitalist intellectuals, founders of new-style enterprises, dissatisfied mid-level and small officials, and local gentry. Comparing the members of the bourgeois political groups with the Boxers, the peasant war character of the latter is particularly prominent. Mysticism and strong religious overtones were even more characteristic of peasant wars. Engels said: "Any struggle against the feudal system had to be cloaked in religious garb at that time, that is, it had to be directed against the church first." The Boxer Movement, which held high the banner of "exterminating foreigners," was certainly more complex than a purely anti-feudal struggle. Elements from other classes besides peasants were drawn into the torrent of opposition to "foreigners," fueling the flames and inciting xenophobia. These included conservative gentry who feared new ideas and new things, small and medium landlords who had conflicts with the church, and so on. However, these elements appeared from the beginning as forces alien to the peasants; only the peasant masses embodied the essence of the movement.

People cannot help but ask: Were the bourgeoisie, who had established the Revive China Society, launched the Hundred Days' Reform, and entered the political arena, not a force against imperialism? The fact is that the bourgeoisie at that time, at least subjectively, did not have the demand to oppose imperialism, but on the contrary, played the role of opposing the Boxer Movement. When the Boxer Movement was reaching its climax in Beijing, the Self-Reliance Army of the Reform Movement rose up along the Yangtze River, and the Revive China Society prepared to launch an anti-Qing uprising in Guangdong. However, neither the Self-Reliance Army nor the Revive China Society recognized the justice of the Boxer Movement, and both insulted the Boxers as "traitors" and "bandits" who should be suppressed. The Self-Reliance Army and the Revive China Society also separately colluded with British and Japanese imperialism, fantasizing about achieving their goals with the support of imperialism through certain local feudal forces. The bourgeoisie showed that they would rather trust imperialism and feudal forces than dare to trust the revolutionary masses. Therefore, a prominent feature of the Boxer Movement was its spontaneity. Without the participation of the bourgeoisie, relying on the peasants, only from the peasants and other working masses could this enormous anti-imperialist power be generated.

Fundamentally opposed to imperialism, with its basic strength derived from the broad masses of the people, this is the true face of the Boxer Movement. Precisely because of this, the Boxer Movement was hated by all reactionaries and subjected to distortions and slanders by various bourgeois apologists, and these distortions and slanders were precisely concentrated on the two main aspects mentioned above.

Chinese and foreign bourgeois historians openly deny imperialist aggression and deny the justice and progressiveness of the Boxer Movement. Among their many stinking arguments, some say that the Boxer Movement was completely unconstructive and was "fanatical and reactionary." Some say that the Boxer Movement originated from religious conflicts between Christians and non-Christians. Some say that this was the result of China's traditional xenophobia and the foolish people's "belief in divine protection." Some say that foreign aggression and the Boxer Movement's anti-aggression should each take fifty strokes of the blame. The Boxer Movement occurred naturally, as a result of the clash between Chinese and Western cultures; "neither China nor the West can be blamed." Americans Morse, Ryder, Stagg, Fenwick, and Clyde, along with Chiang Ting-fu and Xiao Yishan, who followed the Americans' lead, were disseminators of this set of absurd arguments. They are unwilling to admit that war has two natures, just and unjust, and even less willing to admit that the war between imperialism and colonies/semi-colonies is aggressive and unjust on the imperialist side, and revolutionary and just on the side of the people of the colonies/semi-colonies. Their purpose is to cover up the aggressive face of imperialism, obliterate the contradiction between the people of colonies/semi-colonies and imperialist aggressors, and ease the anti-colonialist struggle.

Even more common is that these people all strive to beautify the bourgeoisie and obliterate the revolutionary role of the peasants. Representative is Liang Qichao's argument. Liang Qichao himself called the reformist Hundred Days' Reform the "original driving force" of history, while the Boxer Movement was considered "a peculiar morbid state," even the extreme of a "reactionary force." Until a few years ago, there was also a film called "The Secret History of the Qing Court" which also held this view. The film portrayed the Boxer Movement as chaotic and disorganized, and the reformists as very progressive. A group of foreigners, including Frenchmen Dubarbier, Japanese Yano Jinichi, Shirayanagi Shuko, Kosaku Komakichi, Kubota Bunsaburo, Ozaki Fumio, and Miyazaki Ichisada, all said in unison that the Boxer Movement occurred with the support of the Qing government. Because the Qing government wanted to shift the target of the masses' resistance, the conservative faction's xenophobic sentiments were increasingly reflected in the government's foreign policy, "which resulted in the Boxer Incident." This is completely wrong. The Boxer Movement was originally a type of secret society whose purpose was "opposing the Qing and restoring the Ming." From the beginning, the Qing government identified it as a rebellious group like the Five Pecks of Rice Way and the God Worshipping Society, and resolutely suppressed it. It was only because the power of the masses quickly overwhelmed the ruling power, first in the rural areas of Shandong and Hebei, and then Tianjin and Beijing became the world of the Boxers, that the Qing government gradually and temporarily recognized the legality of the Boxers. The pressure from the Boxer Movement forced the Qing government to outwardly appear tough on imperialism, even declaring war on various countries. The Qing ruling clique certainly had contradictions with imperialism, but this was far from enough to affect its fundamental stance of hostility towards the peasants and reliance on imperialism. Under the strong pressure of the Boxer Movement, a superficial split emerged between the Beijing government and the local power groups in the southeast, but in reality, they were completely consistent. In order to avoid the masses' attacks, Empress Dowager Cixi adopted a deceptive tactic of temporarily supporting the Boxers, while the South, in order to win the favor of imperialism, always opposed the Boxers and maintained a "friendly" relationship with the powers. On the other hand, the Boxer's slogan of "Support the Qing, exterminate the foreign" did not truly ease the contradiction between the peasants and the feudal rulers. In the name of killing "secondary devils," they killed many senior officials of the court, robbed many officials' residences, and even declared that they would investigate the palace, their momentum was so fierce that no one could stop them. Empress Dowager Cixi once said to Wu Yong, the magistrate of Huailai County, on the way to exile: "When the chaos broke out, everyone said that the Boxer bandits were righteous people, how loyal and brave they were, how disciplined and skilled in magic, describing them vividly and truthfully, making it impossible not to believe. Later, they said that the people inside and outside Beijing were all on their side, and that the Manchu and Han armies had all colluded with them, so I dared not lightly say to suppress them. Later... I saw that it was not a good thing, and I understood in my heart that they were useless and unreliable, but at that time their momentum was also great, their numbers were also large, and inside and outside the palace, there was constant chaos, and everywhere I looked, there were people with red cloths wrapped around their heads, coming in and going out, and I could not tell who was a bandit and who was not, and there was no investigation at all. At this time, the eunuchs and the guards were actually mixed up with them... At this time, I could not make up my mind at all, so things got to this point. If I had not compromised in many ways, appeased them slightly to stabilize the hearts of the people, and restrained them greatly to make them still have some respect for me, then the paper tiger would have been torn apart, and I don't know what great chaos would have been caused, and even the emperor would have been in great danger. At one point, they even said: 'There are also secondary devils in the palace, and they must be investigated...' ...You think such a mess, what rules are there?" From Empress Dowager Cixi's self-description, we can see what a huge force the Boxer Movement was, that it could go off the rails at any time and overthrow the rule of the Qing Dynasty. It shows that as long as there is correct leadership, a world-shattering cause can be accomplished. It was this force that not only shattered the imperialist dream of dividing China but also frightened the weak bourgeoisie of China. The Boxer Movement greatly promoted the bourgeois revolutionary movement at that time, but the bourgeois revolutionaries did not dare to use the power of the peasants at all, and tried their best to avoid it, isolating themselves from the masses, in order to show the Western bourgeoisie that their revolution was "civilized." The Chinese bourgeois historians' slander of the Boxer Movement is nothing but a reflection of historical struggles. This class fears imperialism externally and fears the development of peasant revolutionary forces internally, so their historians have adopted the views of foreign bourgeois historians, slandered the peasant revolutionary struggles, and written this slander into their historical works.

The Boxer Movement was the beginning of the large-scale anti-imperialist struggles of the people of colonies and semi-colonies in the 20th century. This movement is now sixty years past, but the struggle against imperialism is still a difficult task for all oppressed people in the world, so historians' comments on the Boxer Movement must also be based on their position on the reality of the current world struggle. This is a place of contention. Continuing to clarify the distortions of the Boxer Movement by domestic and foreign bourgeois historians cannot but be the task of Chinese Marxist-Leninist historians. The Boxer Movement certainly has the naive nature of spontaneous peasant struggles, but we should see the revolutionary activism of the peasant masses from this movement. The national question is essentially the peasant question. Only by correctly leading the peasant masses can the anti-imperialist struggle be thorough. The colonial and semi-colonial bourgeoisie certainly have revolutionary qualities to a certain extent, and the working class should make full use of them; however, these bourgeoisie are two-sided. They fear the masses more than they fear imperialism. When the revolutionary struggle becomes acute, they will collude with imperialism to oppose the workers and peasants. Lenin pointed out in his report to the Second Congress of the Communist International in 1920 that "the bourgeoisie of the exploited countries and the colonial countries already have quite close relations, so the bourgeoisie of the oppressed countries often, or even it can be said in most cases, supports the national movement on the one hand, and compromises with the imperialist bourgeoisie on the other hand, that is, they oppose all revolutionary movements and revolutionary classes together." History has proven Lenin's point of view. At that time, the bourgeoisie of the colonial countries, which had quite close relations with the exploiting countries, had already obtained certain independent powers from the imperialist bourgeoisie due to the upsurge of domestic national movements, in order to deal with other revolutionary classes. The Revive China Society and the Reform Movement during the Boxer Movement are examples of the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie in colonies and semi-colonies. Therefore, if we regard the movement of the colonial bourgeoisie as the mainstream of the national liberation movement, simply applaud and praise it, or strongly support it, while remaining silent about the anti-imperialist struggle of the broad revolutionary masses, or disliking and despising it, then we are in fact adopting a bourgeois point of view and violating Lenin's point of view.

The Boxer anti-imperialist struggle reveals a historical law, that is, imperialist aggression will inevitably lead to the revolution of the people in colonies and semi-colonies. No matter how simple the form it takes at the beginning, this revolution is inevitable. Even if imperialism runs rampant for a time, ultimately only the people are the decisive force in history. The just anti-imperialist struggles of all oppressed nations, no matter how tortuous the road, will surely achieve final victory, and imperialism will eventually perish. The question is whether people dare to fight against imperialism, whether they rely on the weak bourgeoisie, or whether they rely on the people themselves. This was the case not only during the Boxer Movement, but also sixty years later.

What does the Boxer Movement illustrate? It is to illustrate the objective existence of this historical law and the fact that it is still valid today.

    义和团运动说明了什么？
    刘大年
    太平天国、义和团和辛亥革命是中国旧民主主义时期三次革命高潮的顶点。义和团处在前后两个高潮的中间。以反封建为主的太平天国农民战争在三十多年前失败了，资产阶级的辛亥革命还在十年之后。义和团恰当其时，挺身而出，以反帝国主义为己任，这是它的鲜明特色。
    单讲活动的全盛时期，义和团算是很短促的。但是，它的重要性，它的爱国热忱，它的赴汤蹈火的斗争精神，不愧为中国民族觉醒的代表，反侵略斗争的先河。从义和团运动的规模来说，它是长时间以来彼伏此起，蔓延全国的反洋教斗争的一个总汇合。如果两年前的戊戌变法是民族觉醒过程中的一步，那末义和团就是一座巍然高耸的里程碑了。
    为什么本来赤手空拳，揭竿而起，最后悲壮失败的义和团，能够这么勇敢无畏，做出惊天动地的事业来呢？
    看看中国社会当时的主要矛盾，就知道义和团是帝国主义侵略加深，民族灾难空前严重的产物。义和团运动爆发的时候，半个多世纪的外国侵略已经把中国社会最后地推入了半封建半殖民地的深渊。帝国主义瓜分中国的危险迫在眉睫。英、法、日本先后发动四次侵略战争，强迫中国大量割地赔款。英、美等十九国同中国订有最惠国待遇条约和其他不平等条约。外国通商口岸遍布于内地十六省和东北、西藏、台湾的四十五个城市。英、美等七国在中国的十四个商埠占有租界。沿海六个主要港口是外国军事基地。全国三四千公里的铁路都是外国强求建筑、借款修筑或擅自修筑的。全国内河行驶的轮船绝大部分是外国的。海关收入全部抵押给了外国，所有海关税务司都由外国人担任。中国政府所欠英、俄等国各种债款达四亿五千一百多万两，国库全年的收入只有八千多万两，外债永远也还不清。中国的广大区域，北起黑龙江，南至云南、两广，分别为俄、英、德、法、日诸国各自划为势力范围。美国在“门户开放”口号下到处攫取利益。再加上代表帝国主义利益的天主教、基督教近四十个教区，六十多个教会散布各地；约三千个外国传教士活动于全国大部分城镇和乡村里，为非作恶。人民群众在日常生活中时刻都感到帝国主义的压力，不能自由呼吸。要中国人民甘心长此生活下去，不起来进行斗争，不反抗侵略，这是不可能的。义和团正是由这个矛盾产生的，是这个矛盾的剧烈爆发。义和团运动是一个反帝国主义侵略的爱国运动，义和团进行的战争是反对帝国主义的、革命的、进步的战争。
    义和团斗争是由农民群众发起的，是又一次农民革命，参加的基本群众首先是农民，其次是手工业者、城市贫民、散兵游勇、小商贩和水陆运输工人等。运动的主要领导人物是教门首领（朱洪灯）、游方僧人（本明和尚）、下级军官（李来中）、船夫（张德成）、游勇（曹福田）、江湖艺人（黄莲圣母）等。中国旧式农民战争历来就是由这些人出头露面的。当时，资产阶级的政治团体有兴中会、维新派两个派别。兴中会的成员是小资产阶级知识分子、城市小资产阶级和华侨资本家。维新派的成员是半封建半资本主义知识分子、新式企业的创办者、不满现状的中小官吏和地方士绅。拿资产阶级政治团体的成员与义和团对照一下，后者的农民战争本色显得格外突出。神秘主义，浓厚的宗教色彩，更是农民战争的特色。恩格斯说：“任何反对封建制度的斗争，在当时都必然要披上宗教的外衣，即首先必然要针对着教会。”高举着“灭洋”旗子的义和团当然比单纯的反封建斗争要复杂些。农民以外的其他阶层的分子卷进反对“洋人”的洪流里，推波助澜，煽动群众排外心理的一面。他们之中包括害怕新思想、新事物的守旧士绅，与教会有矛盾的中小地主等等。但这些分子一开始就是作为农民的异己势力出现的，体现运动本质的只是农民群众。
  　人们不禁要问：建立起兴中会、发动过戊戌变法、走上了政治舞台的资产阶级，难道不是反对帝国主义的力量吗？事实是当时资产阶级至少主观上并没有反对帝国主义的要求，而是相反，扮演了反对义和团的脚色。当义和团在北京进入高潮时，维新派的自立军崛起长江一带，兴中会准备在广东举行反清起义。但是，自立军、兴中会都不承认义和团的正义性，都辱骂义和团是应当剿除的“奸民”和“贼匪”。自立军、兴中会又都分头与英、日帝国主义相结纳，幻想在帝国主义支持下通过某些地方封建势力来达到自己的目的。资产阶级表现出了宁肯信任帝国主义、封建势力，也不敢信任革命群众。因此，义和团运动的一个显著特点是它的自发性，没有资产阶级参与，依靠农民，也只有从农民和其他劳动群众中才产生出了这股巨大的反帝国主义的威力。
  　与帝国主义根本相对立，基本力量来源于广大人民群众，这就是义和团的本来面目。正是因为如此，义和团就遭到了一切反动派的痛恨，遭到了各式各样资产阶级辩护士的曲解和诬蔑，并且这些曲解、诬蔑也恰恰就是集中在上述两个主要的方面。
    中外资产阶级历史家明目张胆地否认帝国主义侵略，否认义和团的正义性、进步性。在他们许多臭气熏腾的议论中，有说义和团毫无建设性，是“狂热和反动”的。有说义和团是起源于基督教徒与非教徒宗教信仰冲突的。有的说这是中国传统的排外心理和愚民“自信有鬼神保佑”的结果。有的说外国的侵略、义和团反侵略应该各打五十板。义和团只是自然而然发生的，是中西文化冲突的结果，“对中国和西洋都不能加以责难”。美国的马士、赖德烈、施达格、费纳克、克莱德，跟在美国人屁股后面的蒋廷黻、萧一山等，就是这一套荒谬议论的传播者。他们不愿意承认战争有正义的与非正义的两种性质，更不敢承认帝国主义与殖民地半殖民地间的战争在帝国主义一面是侵略的、非正义的，在殖民地半殖民地人民一面是革命的、正义的。他们的目的是要掩盖帝国主义的侵略面目，抹煞殖民地半殖民地人民和帝国主义侵略者的矛盾，缓和反殖民主义斗争。
    更加普遍的是这些人都竭力美化资产阶级，抹煞农民的革命作用。有代表性的是梁启超的议论。梁启超自己把改良主义的戊戌变法叫做是历史的“原动力”，而义和团则被认为是“一种奇特的病态”，以至是“反动力”的极端。直到前几年还有个叫做《清宫秘史》的电影也是这种观点。电影里把义和团描写得乱糟糟，把改良主义者打扮得非常进步。一批外国人，包括法国杜巴比艾、日本矢野仁一、白柳秀湖、高桑驹吉、洼田文三、小竹文夫、宫崎市定等，又都异口同声说义和团是在清政府的支持下发生的。因为清政府想转移群众的反抗目标，守旧派的排外感情日益反映到政府的对外方针中来，“其结果产生了义和团事件”。这是完全错误的。义和团本是那些以“反清复明”为宗旨的秘密结社的一种。清政府也一开始就认定它是五斗米道、拜上帝会式的反叛者，坚决加以镇压。仅仅是由于群众势力很快压倒了统治势力，先是山东、河北农村，然后是天津、北京都成了义和团的天下，清政府才逐步地暂时地承认义和团的合法。义和团的压力使清政府不得不表面上对帝国主义表示强硬，甚至向各国宣战。清朝统治集团与帝国主义固然也有矛盾，但是这绝不足以影响它敌视农民、投靠帝国主义的根本立场。在义和团的强大压力下，北京政府与东南地方实力派之间呈现出表面上的分裂，实际上是完全一致的。西太后为要躲开群众的打击锋芒，采取暂时赞助义和团的欺骗办法，南方为了博得帝国主义欢心，始终反对义和团，与列强维持着“友好”关系。另一方面，义和团的“扶清灭洋”的口号也并没有使农民和封建统治者的矛盾真正缓和下来。他们在杀“二毛子”的名义下，杀了许多朝廷的大员，抢了许多大官的住宅，还声言要清查宫廷，其势汹汹，谁也禁阻不得。西太后在流亡途中有一次对怀来知县吴永说：“当乱起时，人人都说拳匪是义民，怎样的忠勇，怎样的有纪律，有法术，描影画态，千真万确，教人不能不信。后来又说京外人心怎样的一伙儿向着他们，又说满汉各军都已与他们打通一气了，因此更不敢轻说剿办。后来……我瞧着不像个事，心下早明白，他们是不中用靠不住的，但那时他们势头也大了，人数也多了，宫内宫外，纷纷扰扰，满眼看去，都是一起儿头上包着红布，进的进，出的出，也认不定谁是匪，谁不是匪，一些也没有考究。这时太监们连着护卫的兵士，却真正同他们混在一起了。……这时我一个人已作不得十分主意，所以闹到如此田地。我若不是多方委曲，一面稍稍的迁就他们，稳住了众心，一方又大段的制住他们，使他们对着我还有几分瞻顾，那时纸老虎穿破了，更不知道闹出什么大乱子，连皇帝都担着很大的危险。他们一会子甚至说：‘宫里也有二毛子，须要查验。’……你想这样胡闹，还讲什么上下规矩么？”从西太后这段自述中可以看出义和团是一个多么巨大的力量，它随时都可以越出轨道，把清朝的统治打翻在地。它表明只要有正确的领导，就能够做出一番惊天动地的事业来。正是这个力量，不但粉碎了帝国主义瓜分中国的迷梦，也把中国的软弱的资产阶级吓破了胆。义和团大大地推动了当时资产阶级的革命运动，但是资产阶级革命派一点不敢运用农民的力量，并且极力避开它，使自己同群众隔离开来，以便向西方的资产阶级表示，他们的革命是“文明的”。中国的资产阶级历史家对于义和团的诬蔑无非是历史斗争的反映。这个阶级在外面害怕帝国主义，在内部害怕农民革命势力的发展，所以他们的历史家就采取了外国资产阶级历史家的观点，对农民的革命斗争加以诬蔑，并且把这种诬蔑写进了他们的历史著作里面。
    义和团运动是二十世纪殖民地半殖民地人民大规模反帝斗争的开始。这个运动过去六十年了，但是反对帝国主义的斗争迄今仍旧是世界一切被压迫人民的艰巨的任务，所以历史家对于义和团运动的评论也必然是以他们对目前世界斗争的现实的立场为依据。这里依据是一个争论的场所。继续廓清国内外资产阶级历史家对于义和团运动的歪曲，也不能不是中国马克思列宁主义历史家的任务。义和团运动当然带有自发的农民斗争的纯朴的性质，但是我们应当从这个运动看到农民群众的革命积极性。民族问题实质上是农民问题。只有正确地把农民群众领导起来，反帝斗争才会是彻底的。殖民地半殖民地资产阶级固然在一定程度上具有革命性，工人阶级应当尽量加以利用；但是，这些资产阶级是有两面性的，他们害怕群众甚于害怕帝国主义，一到革命斗争尖锐化的时候，他们就会结纳帝国主义而反对工农群众了。列宁在1920年共产国际第二次代表大会的报告中曾经指出，“剥削国家和殖民地国家的资产阶级已经有相当亲密的关系，所以被压迫国家的资产阶级往往甚至可以说在大多数的场合下，都是一方面支持民族运动，一方面又同帝国主义资产阶级妥协，也就是同他们一起来反对一切革命运动和革命阶级。”历史证明了列宁的观点。当时与剥削国家有相当亲密的关系的殖民地国家的资产阶级，有的已经由于国内民族运动的高涨，从帝国主义资产阶级获得了某种独立国家的权力，来对付其他革命阶级。义和团运动时的兴中会、维新派就是殖民地半殖民地中资产阶级具有两面性的例证。因此，如果把殖民地资产阶级的运动看做民族解放运动的主流，单纯地拍手称赞，或者大力支持，而对广大革命群众的反帝斗争却是默不作声，或者厌恶鄙视，那就在事实上采取了资产阶级观点，违背了列宁的观点。
    义和团反帝斗争揭出了一个历史规律，这就是帝国主义侵略一定引起殖民地半殖民地人民的革命。不论在开始的时候所采取的形式是多么简陋，这个革命是不可避免的。帝国主义那怕横行一时，最终只有人民群众才是历史的决定力量。一切被压迫民族的反帝国主义的正义斗争，不管道路多么曲折，必定会获得最后胜利，帝国主义最后必定要灭亡的。问题在于人们敢不敢同帝国主义斗争，是依靠软弱的资产阶级，还是依靠人民群众自己。不只义和团时期是这样，就是六十年后的今天也还是这样。
    义和团运动说明了什么？就是说明了这一历史规律的客观存在和它今天仍然是有效的这个问题。
