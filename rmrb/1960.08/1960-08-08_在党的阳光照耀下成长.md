Speaking of writing, I really feel ashamed. In the factory, I am considered a veteran with seventeen years of service; in writing, I am just a new recruit.

I am the workshop director of the metalworking shop at the Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory. This factory is a modern factory with first-class production technology, and people from all walks of life often come to visit. Party and state leaders have also inspected our factory, especially the achievements of technical revolution in our workshop. This gives great encouragement to the vast number of workers fighting on the front lines of production. In addition, batches of foreign guests come to visit frequently. Some delegations and experts from fraternal countries are happy for our achievements and give high praise to the outstanding talents of our Chinese worker brothers in technical revolution.

However, some delegations, experts, and doctors from capitalist countries are different. Once, I accompanied a group of foreign science and technology figures on a visit. When they first entered the factory, they were arrogant and condescending. They carefully observed the precision machine tools used to process various precision instrument parts, especially paying close attention to the domestically produced machine tools – the nameplates read: Qiqihar Machine Tool Factory, Shenyang Machine Tool Factory, Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Kunming… machine tool factory names, and they stared intently as our energetic workers skillfully operated these new equipment. They were shocked! They walked out of the metalworking shop, which was over 90% mechanized, and entered the assembly building, which was spotlessly clean. They watched the female workers in white overalls sitting on both sides of the conveyor belt, skillfully assembling various precision instruments; they silently calculated our factory's output. When they walked out of the assembly building, their attitude changed! They had to admire us with a smile and understand politeness! They lost to us!

Thinking about the past, we suffered the trampling and bullying of domestic reactionaries and foreign imperialists; but now, the imperialists and capitalists seem so small and not to be feared in front of us! This feeling of pride made me unable to resist picking up a pen. My plan was immediately encouraged and assisted by the factory Party committee and the Writers Association branch, and supported by the vast number of worker comrades. Amidst the roar of machine tools, I wrote my first short story: "The People Who Stood Up!" (This article was originally published in the June 1958 issue of "Northern Literature" magazine and reprinted in the supplement of this newspaper on July 5, 1958. – Editor)

To my surprise, this novel received encouragement from the veteran writer Mao Dun. So, with a surge of energy, I further developed it into a film script, which was filmed by "Changchun Film Studio" into a movie.

Since the Great Leap Forward, heroes have been fighting on the front lines of production, and the vivid deeds are like a vast ocean, truly inexhaustible and unwriteable! Once, the heating furnace in our factory's spray painting workshop malfunctioned due to a fault in the electrical automatic control device, and the furnace temperature rose. The chemical gas in the dried painted parts suddenly expanded, and at the critical moment when an explosion and fire were about to occur, a veteran of the Volunteer Army rushed up without regard for anything, pulled down the switch, and quickly opened the vent. At this time, what spewed out of the furnace was not hot air but whistling flames. The spray painting room was full of flammable chemicals. Buckets of thinner, gasoline, and colored paint, if one bucket caught fire, would cause serious losses… This veteran did not be scared by the fire. He opened his arms, straightened his chest, and protected the furnace opening, letting the flames lick his chest. The front of his old cotton military uniform was scorched, and he turned around to block it with his back. Under the alternating protection of the fire on his front and back, it finally finished spraying. The cotton coat was scorched, the furnace did not explode, and the thinner and gasoline did not catch fire. A few minutes later, the rhythmic roar of the air pump spray gun came from the spray painting workshop again.

With the greatest enthusiasm, with an excited pen, I described this communist hero – true gold is not afraid of fire! Praising his noble qualities of not considering personal safety at all for the sake of collective interests!

In this way, for more than two years, in the gaps between directing production battles, I have written dozens of works, large and small, half of which are short stories and features. I can write these works, first of all, as a result of the Party's training.

I would also like to take this opportunity to talk about my feelings about attending this literary and art congress. When I was about to come to Beijing, everyone, whether the leaders of the factory or the workers in the workshop, was happy that I could attend such a congress. This means that the broad masses of the working class have also turned themselves over culturally. The worker comrades saw me off, and they all asked me to send their regards and best wishes to Chairman Mao and said that I didn't need to worry about the production of the workshop. My family has an eighty-year-old grandmother, and she clamored to see me off. I persuaded her not to go to the station. She touched the top of my head and said: You "won the first place in the imperial examination"! Our family has been working as beasts of burden for generations, and we have been illiterate for generations! You have been working for the capitalists since you were fourteen years old, who would have thought that you could hold a pen now! If it weren't for Chairman Mao, how could you have such a big achievement!

In the old society, it was not just my family that was illiterate for generations! And today, there are more than just me who can be masters of their own affairs, both literary and martial, and write poems and articles! Let the imperialists tremble, let the revisionists rave, let all kinds of petty bourgeoisie intellectuals gesticulate! We, on the other hand, must be firm, and bravely move forward! A few days ago, I received letters from the factory and the workshop, saying that the factory had completed the national plan for July ten days ahead of schedule and would strive to step into 1961 one hundred days ahead of National Day, and asked me to report the good news to the congress!

Our young generation must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: guard against arrogance and rashness, and under the earnest guidance of the old predecessors in the literary world, study hard, produce hard, and also write hard, hold up the red banner of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought even higher, and stride forward valiantly!

### 在党的阳光照耀下成长

    在党的阳光照耀下成长	郭先红
    讲写作，我确实感到惭愧。在工厂里，我算是一个有十七年工龄的老兵；在写作上，却是一个刚刚入伍的新战士。
    我在哈尔滨电表仪器厂金工车间担当车间主任。这个工厂是一座具有第一流生产技术水平的现代化工厂，经常有各方面的人来参观。党和国家领导同志也曾经到我们厂视察工作，特别是到我们车间视察过技术革命成就。这给予我们战斗在生产第一线上的广大职工很大的鼓舞。此外，还经常有成批的外宾前来访问。一些来自兄弟国家的代表团和专家们，看到我们所获得的成就，为我们高兴，对我们中国工人兄弟技术革命的卓越才能，给予很高的赞扬。
    可是某些来自资本主义国家的代表团，专家、博士们就不一样了。有一次，我陪同一批外国科学技术界人士参观，他们刚进工厂参观的时候，骄矜高傲，目中无人。他们仔细地观察了我们加工生产的各种精密仪表零件的精密机床，特别是非常注意到国产工作母机——标牌上写的是：齐齐哈尔机床厂、沈阳机床厂、北京、南京、上海、昆明……机床厂的字样，又出神地看着我们生龙活虎般的工人在非常熟练地操纵这些新式设备，他们感到震惊！他们走出机械化程度高达90％以上的金工车间，进入洁净得一尘不染的装配大楼。他们看着那些身穿白色工作服的女工正坐在传送带两旁灵巧地装配着各种精密仪表；他们默默地计算着我厂的产量。走出装配大楼时，他们的态度变了！不得不钦佩地对我们微笑了，也懂得礼貌了！他们输给我们了！
    想想过去，我们受着国内反动派和外国帝国主义者的践踏和欺侮；而现在，帝国主义和资本主义者在我们面前显得那么渺小，不足畏惧！这种自豪的感情，使我忍不住想提起笔来。我这种打算，立刻受到工厂党委和作协分会的鼓励和帮助，受到广大工人同志们的支持。就在机床轰鸣声中，我写成了第一个短篇小说：《站起来的人们》！（此文原载1958年6月号《北方》杂志1958年7月5日本报副刊转载。——编者）
    使我受惊的是，这篇小说受到了老前辈茅盾同志的鼓励。于是我一股干劲，进一步把它写成电影剧本，经“长影”拍成了电影。
    大跃进以来，英雄们战斗在生产第一线上，生动的事迹如浩瀚的大海，真是说不尽也写不完哪！有一次，我厂喷漆车间加温炉由于电气自动控制装置发生故障而炉温升高，炉内干燥的喷漆件化学气体骤然膨胀，在就要发生爆炸起火事故的一刹那，有一位志愿军转业军人，不顾一切地冲了上去，拉下电闸，迅速地打开通气孔，这时候炉内喷出来的不是热空气而是咝咝啸叫的火苗子。喷漆间全是化学易燃品。一桶一桶的信那水、汽油、色漆，如果有一桶烧着了，就会造成严重的损失……。这位转业军人没有被火吓倒，他张开双臂，挺起胸脯，护住了炉口，让喷出来的火舌舐着他的胸膛。旧棉军装前身烧焦了，他反过身来用脊背挡着。火，在他的前后身左右交替遮挡下，终于喷射完了。棉袄烧焦了，炉子没有爆炸，信那水、汽油没有着起来，几分钟以后，喷漆车间又传来了气泵喷枪有节奏的吼叫声。
    我用最大的热情，用激动的笔，描写了这位共产主义的英雄——真金不怕火炼！歌颂他那为了集体利益而根本不考虑个人安危的崇高品质！
    就这样，两年多来，在指挥生产战斗的间隙里，我写成大小几十个作品，其中半数是短篇小说和特写。我能写出这些作品，首先是党培养的结果。
    我还要借此机会谈谈参加这次文代大会的感受。当我临来北京的时候，不论是工厂的领导、车间的工人，大家为我能出席这样的大会而感到高兴。这意味着广大工人阶级在文化上也翻身了。工人同志们给我送行，纷纷托我给毛主席问安捎好，并表示不用我挂心车间的生产。我家有个八十多岁的老奶奶，她吵着要为我送行。我好说歹说不让她去车站，她摸摸我的头顶说：你“中状元”了！咱家祖祖辈辈当牛马，世世代代是睁眼瞎！你从十四岁就给资本家干活，谁想到现在也能拿笔杆子呀！要不是毛主席，你哪有这么大的出息呀！
    在旧社会世世代代做睁眼瞎子的劳动人民岂止我一家呀！而今天当家作主人能文能武能写诗作文章的人又何止我一个人哪！让帝国主义者颤抖去吧，让修正主义者狂吠去吧，让形形色色的资产阶级和小资产阶级思想意识的小人们指手划脚去吧！我们呢，要坚定不移，英勇地大步前进！前几天，我收到工厂和车间的来信，说是工厂已提前十天超额完成7月份国家计划；并要争取国庆节前提前百天跨入1961年，叫我向大会报喜！
    我们青年一代，一定牢牢地记住毛主席的教导：戒骄戒躁，在文学界老前辈们的谆谆教导之下，努力学习，努力生产，也努力写作，更高地举起毛主席文艺思想的红旗，昂首阔步，奋勇前进！
