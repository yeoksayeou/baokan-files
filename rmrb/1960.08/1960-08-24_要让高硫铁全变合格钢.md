    Turn All High-Sulfur Iron into Qualified Steel
    Under the leadership of the factory Party committee, our group has plunged into the surging movement of increasing production and practicing economy to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the annual steel production plan.
    High sulfur content in molten iron is a prominent problem in our group's production. Some say: if the sulfur content of molten iron is around 0.3%, qualified steel cannot be produced. But we say: molten iron is made by people, and steel is refined by people. We must not let high-sulfur iron stump us. Our group has summarized and promoted advanced operating methods, and we have refined qualified steel even with high-sulfur iron. Since the beginning of this year, we have also created a new record of continuous blowing of more than 500 heats without defective products. We guarantee to create even greater achievements and refine more good steel for the country.

### 要让高硫铁全变合格钢

    要让高硫铁全变合格钢
    我们小组在工厂党委的领导下，投入了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，保证完成和超额完成全年产钢计划。
    铁水含硫高，是目前我们小组生产中的一个比较突出的问题。有人说：铁水含硫如果在百分之零点三左右，就炼不出合格钢来。可是我们说：铁水是人化出来的，钢是人炼出来的，决不能叫高硫铁把人难住。我们小组总结推行了先进操作方法，用含硫高的铁水也炼出了合格钢。今年以来，我们还创造了连续吹炼五百多炉无废品的新纪录。我们保证要创造更大的成绩，为国家多炼好钢。
