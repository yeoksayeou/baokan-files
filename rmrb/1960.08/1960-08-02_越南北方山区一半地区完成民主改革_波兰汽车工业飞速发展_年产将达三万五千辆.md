Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th -- According to Hanoi newspapers today, Tran Huu Duc, member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Minister of Rural Affairs, announced at a summary meeting on agricultural cooperation and democratic reform in mountainous areas held on July 29th that by the end of June, 1,144 communes in the northern mountainous areas of Vietnam had completed democratic reform, and the area where democratic reform had been completed accounted for more than half of the mountainous area.

　　Tran Huu Duc said that according to statistics from 984 communes, in the democratic reform movement, 9,539 hectares of land and 2,332 cattle have been completely owned by farmers. After the democratic reform movement, the class consciousness of ethnic minorities in mountainous areas has been raised, and they have established an attitude of being masters of their own affairs.
  When talking about the situation of the agricultural cooperation movement in mountainous areas, Tran Huu Duc said that by the end of June, a total of 5,971 agricultural production cooperatives had been established in mountainous areas, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounted for 40.36% of the total number of peasant households.

  Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 29th -- Poland, which did not produce automobiles before the war, has now become a developed country in automobile manufacturing.
  The automobile manufacturing industry has become an important sector in Polish industry. In the first half of this year alone, Poland manufactured more than 6,600 cars and nearly 9,500 trucks. The total production of automobiles this year will be 35,000 vehicles. The Erchangsk factory in Poland could only repair automobiles two years ago. Now, this industrial enterprise has completely become a factory for producing automobiles. This factory is now able to manufacture the "Bison" type of new truck, which has a carrying capacity of eight tons. This car, designed by Polish designers, is very economical. The engine has a traction of 160 horsepower. The car only needs 24 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers. In addition, this car can tow two trailers with a carrying capacity of 22 tons. Last year, this factory provided the country with products worth 200 million zlotys (Polish currency). This year, this number will double, and by the end of the Five-Year Plan, it will increase tenfold.
  The first automobile factory in the Polish automobile industry was the Starahovitz Automobile Factory. In the postwar years, this factory produced tens of thousands of "Star" brand trucks. The Dzerzhinsky Automobile Factory in Starahovitz is now producing diesel engine trucks with greater horsepower.
  In Warsaw and Lublin, factories that produce cars and trucks have also grown up. These automobile factories are constantly improving production efficiency. The Warsaw Automobile Factory will manufacture 15,500 "Warsaw" brand cars and 4,000 "Siren" brand cars this year. In addition, this factory will provide more than 6,000 chassis with engines to other automobile factories in the country.
  The "Warsaw" brand car produced in Poland. This car enjoys a high reputation throughout Poland and is also one of Poland's main export commodities. (Issued by Xinhua News Agency)

    越南北方山区一半地区完成民主改革
    波兰汽车工业飞速发展　年产将达三万五千辆
    新华社河内30日电　据河内报纸今天报道，越南劳动党中央委员、农村工作部部长陈友翼在7月29日召开的山区农业合作化和民主改革工作总结会议上宣布，截至6月底为止，越南北方山区已有一千一百四十四个乡完成了民主改革，完成民主改革的地区已占山区面积的一半以上。
    陈友翼说，据九百八十四个乡的统计，在民主改革运动中，已有九千五百三十九公顷土地和二千三百三十二头牛完全归农民所有。在民主改革运动以后，山区少数民族的阶级觉悟已有提高，并且树立了主人翁的态度。
  陈友翼在谈到山区农业合作化运动的情况时说，截至6月底为止，山区共建立了五千九百七十一个农业生产合作社，入社农户已占总农户的40.36％。
    新华社华沙29日讯　在战前不生产汽车的波兰，现在已经变成汽车制造业发达的国家了。
    汽车制造业已成为波兰工业中的重要部门。仅仅在今年上半年，波兰全国就制造了六千六百多辆小汽车和将近九千五百辆载重汽车。今年全年将总共生产汽车三万五千辆。波兰的埃耳昌斯克工厂两年前还只能修理汽车。现在这个工业企业已完全变成了生产汽车的工厂。这个工厂已经能够制造“野牛牌”的新型载重汽车，它的载重量为八吨。这种由波兰设计师设计的汽车是非常经济的。发动机的牵引力为一百六十马力。汽车每行驶一百公里只需要二十四升燃料。此外，这种汽车能够牵引两节载重二十二吨的拖车。这家工厂去年为国家提供了价值为两亿兹罗提（波币）的产品。今年，这个数字将增加一倍，而到五年计划结束时，将增加到十倍。
    波兰汽车工业的第一个工厂是斯塔拉霍维茨汽车工厂。在战后年代，这个工厂生产了好几万辆“星牌”载重汽车。斯塔拉霍维茨的捷尔任斯基汽车工厂现在又生产马力更大的柴油发动机载重汽车。
    在华沙和卢布林，生产小汽车和载重汽车的工厂也成长起来了。这些汽车工厂都在不断地提高生产效率。华沙汽车厂今年将制造一万五千五百辆“华沙”牌汽车和四千辆“汽笛牌”汽车。此外，这个工厂将向国内其他汽车工厂提供六千多套带发动机的底盘。
