Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 10th - The Heilongjiang Provincial Higher People's Court, with the approval of the Supreme People's Court, announced the death sentence for Liu Xingbang, a special agent dispatched by the Chiang gang's "Intelligence Bureau" special agent organization. The sentence was carried out on August 6th. The other four special agent elements involved in the same case were sentenced to life imprisonment.

The key special agent element Liu Xingbang betrayed the motherland during the period of Japanese puppet rule, acting as a henchman for the Japanese invaders. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, he defected to the Chiang gang's "Bureau of Investigation and Statistics" special agent organization and served as a special agent. In the early days of national liberation, he fled to Hong Kong and continued to engage in special agent activities. After receiving specialized special agent training in Hong Kong, he accepted the dispatch of the Chiang gang's "Intelligence Bureau" and secretly came to Harbin, Jiamusi, and other places to carry out sabotage activities. He also actively recruited personnel and developed special agent elements, using various means to collect intelligence on our military, political, and economic affairs, and attempted to set up radio stations and establish so-called "underground supply stations." Under the close surveillance of the broad masses and public security organs, the special agent elements' conspiracies did not succeed. They were finally cracked down upon by our public security organs, and material evidence such as American-made radio stations and secret writing tools were seized. After being arrested by us, Liu Xingbang and other special agent elements attempted to escape punishment and behaved cunningly. However, in the face of conclusive evidence, they could not deny the various counter-revolutionary criminal activities they had carried out, and confessed everything.

    黑龙江判处一批蒋帮特务
    主犯刘兴邦处死刑，同案四人判无期徒刑
    新华社哈尔滨10日电　黑龙江省高级人民法院经最高人民法院批准，宣布判处蒋帮特务机关“情报局”派遣特务刘兴邦死刑，已于8月6日执行，同案的其他四名特务分子被判处无期徒刑。
    特务骨干分子刘兴邦在日伪统治时期，就背叛祖国，充当日寇爪牙，抗战结束以后又投靠蒋帮特务机关“保密局”充当特务，全国解放初期逃到香港，继续进行特务活动。在香港经过专门特务训练之后，接受蒋帮特务机关“情报局”的派遣，潜来哈尔滨、佳木斯等地进行破坏活动，并积极网罗人员，发展特务分子，采取各种手段搜集我军事、政治、经济等各方面的情报，并企图架设电台和建立所谓“地下补给站”。在广大群众和公安机关的严密监视下，特务分子的这些阴谋都没有得逞，终于被我公安机关全部破获，并搜出美国制造的电台以及密写工具等物证。刘兴邦等特务分子在被我逮捕后企图逃避惩罚，态度狡猾，但是在确凿的证据面前，对其所进行的各种反革命罪恶活动终于无法抵赖，全部供认。
