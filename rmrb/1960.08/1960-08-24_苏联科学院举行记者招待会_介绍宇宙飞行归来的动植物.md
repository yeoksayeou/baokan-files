Xinhua News Agency, 22nd August. TASS reports: The Soviet Academy of Sciences held a press conference in Moscow on the 22nd. Gazenko, a representative of the Academy of Sciences, presented the cosmonaut dogs "Belka" and "Strelka" and the animals and plants that participated in the flight, and described their condition.

Gazenko said that "Belka" and "Strelka," who traveled 700,000 kilometers in space, had been training for a year before entering space. When they were flying in space, they were fed a paste-like food containing nutrients and water. This food was automatically fed twice a day.

The dogs wore special clothes during their space flight. They wore a rubber plastron close to the body and shorts with equipment for collecting excrement. Outside, they wore a so-called fixed suit made of Kapron. This suit was to prevent foreign objects from damaging the sensors inserted into the animal's body.

Before the dogs flew into space, electrodes were inserted into their bodies to obtain their electrocardiograms. To accurately record their blood pressure, their carotid arteries were moved into skin flap tissue. All of these preparatory operations did not affect the animal's physiological condition.

The two dogs became familiar with each other during flight training. They were placed side by side in the spaceship's container, separated only by a thin net. This was the first space flight for "Belka" and "Strelka."

Gazenko said that ground observers saw the dogs' condition during the flight on the television screen. They were both very quiet. Only at certain times, especially during the launch of the spaceship, did their activity increase. They also showed some impatience when the spacecraft entered orbit. "Belka" and "Strelka" sometimes increased their activity in the weightless state, but this was a normal phenomenon in this state. Their weightless state lasted for about twenty-four hours. As soon as they entered the state of maximum overload, they immediately calmed down.

Those attending the press conference could see with their own eyes that "Belka" and "Strelka" had no bumps or abrasions on their bodies.

Gazenko also showed two cages of mice that participated in the space flight. These rodents are most suitable for testing the effects of space conditions, especially cosmic radiation, on heredity. If gray hair appears on the black fur of the mice, it can be determined that cosmic radiation has already affected them. But so far, no such change in pigment has been found. Next to the cages containing the mice were food packs and water tanks, so that they could eat and drink separately.

Flies were packed in small flasks made of transparent plastic inside the spacecraft. Each flask contained about fifty flies. Two flasks were shown at the press conference. They and their descendants will be used to study genetic variation.

Also on display at the press conference was a type of plant carried in the spacecraft this time - Tradescantia fluminensis. This plant is still flowering.

Gazenko finally said that a thorough study of the organisms on the second spacecraft is currently underway. The results of the research are of great importance for future space flights, and these results will be announced. (Attached picture)

### 苏联科学院举行记者招待会  介绍宇宙飞行归来的动植物

    苏联科学院举行记者招待会
    介绍宇宙飞行归来的动植物
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联科学院22日在莫斯科举行了记者招待会。科学院的代表加津科出示了宇宙旅行者小狗“松鼠”、“小箭”和参加飞行的动植物，并讲述了它们的情况。
    加津科说，这次在宇宙空间旅行了七十万公里的“松鼠”和“小箭”，在进入宇宙前已经训练了一年。当它们在宇宙中飞行的时候，喂的是包含营养物质和水分的膏状食物。这种食物每天自动喂送两次。
    小狗在宇宙飞行时穿着了特殊的衣服。贴身穿着橡皮胸甲和附有装排泄物的设备的裤衩。外面再穿上用卡普隆制成的所谓固定服。这种衣服是防止插入动物体内的传感器受到外来损伤的。
    小狗在飞进宇宙空间以前，身体上插了电极以便得到它们的心动电流图。为了准确记录下它们的血压，把它们的颈动脉移到了皮瓣组织中。所有这一切预备手术都没有影响动物的生理状况。
    两只小狗在飞行训练期间，互相都很熟悉了。它们在宇宙飞船的容器中，并列在一起，中间只隔着一层薄网。这是“松鼠”和“小箭”的第一次宇宙飞行。
    加津科说，地面观测人员在电视的萤光屏上看到小狗在飞行中的情况。它们都表现得很安静。只是在有些时候，特别是在宇宙飞船起飞的时候，它们的活动增加了。它们在飞船进入轨道的时候，也表现了一些急躁。“松鼠”和“小箭”在飞行的失重状态中，有时活动增加，但是，这是在这种状态中的正常现象。它们的失重状态持续了约二十四小时。当它们一进入最大的超重状态时，立刻就平静下来了。
    参加招待会的人可以亲眼看到“松鼠”和“小箭”身上一点也没有撞伤和擦伤。
    加津科还出示了参加宇宙飞行的两笼老鼠。这些啮齿动物最便于用来试验宇宙条件特别是宇宙辐射对遗传的影响。如果小鼠的黑的毛皮上出现灰毛，那末就可确定宇宙辐射对它们已经发生了影响。但是直到现在还没有发现这种色素上的变化。装老鼠的笼子旁边都设有食物包和饮水罐的设备，这样它们就能分别吃食和饮水。
    在宇宙飞船中的用透明的塑料制成的小烧瓶里装着苍蝇。每个烧瓶中约装五十个。在招待会上出示了两个烧瓶。它们和它们的后代将用来研究遗传变异。
    在招待会上还展出了宇宙飞船中这次携带的植物的一种——紫鸭跖草。这种植物还继续在开花。
    加津科最后说，目前正对第二个宇宙飞船上的生物进行彻底的研究。研究的结果对今后的宇宙飞行具有极大的重要性，这些结果将予公布。（附图片）
