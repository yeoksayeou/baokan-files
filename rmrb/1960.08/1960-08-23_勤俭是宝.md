    Diligence and Thrift are Treasures
    Wang Guofan

    Now that all sectors are supporting agriculture, how should we peasants boost our energy? I think the most important thing is not to rely on state support, not to be "reach-out" types. We must further promote the spirit of hard struggle: "The more we sweat, the more we produce."

    If we want to quickly enrich our family fortune, it all comes down to "diligence" and "thrift." Diligence and thrift are like a "treasure bowl," a "family heirloom" left to us by generations of Chinese people. We do things diligently and thriftily, not afraid of any hardship, using our own hands to drive away "poverty and blankness."

    First, let's talk about "diligence." The "National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967)" says it well: "Diligence means mobilizing commune members to work diligently, actively expanding the scope of production under possible and necessary conditions, developing diversified economies, and conducting meticulous work." It also specifically mentions that all kinds of capital construction should make full use of their own manpower, materials, and financial resources as much as possible. From this, it can be seen that developing agriculture requires diligent work and not being afraid of hardship.

    A few days ago, our Jianming Commune encountered such a thing: in order to support our march towards agricultural modernization, the state lent us 3.5 million yuan in machinery, originally saying that we should pay it back within three to five years. However, the commune members calculated: no, if our commune occupies this large sum of money for three to five years, it may affect the country's construction speed. We can't just take care of ourselves and not think about the country. Everyone was determined to work hard for a year to pay off the loan. People said, "The Party and the state care about us and are so considerate of us, we should only work harder." How to boost energy? We still have to carry forward the spirit of the "poor stick," using the old method of starting from scratch with "three donkey legs," going up the mountain to collect firewood and find treasures. As soon as it was said, it was done. The whole commune was mobilized to work hard and fiercely on the mountain, while extracting public accumulation and mobilizing commune members to invest. Several aspects were advancing at the same time. As a result, in just four months, nearly one million yuan was raised. The commune members further recognized that not being afraid of hardship and working diligently are the main factors in promoting agricultural modernization and winning a bumper grain harvest. Therefore, whether in drought resistance, sowing, or wasteland reclamation, the vast majority of commune members worked hard, diligently, and conscientiously, overcoming one difficulty after another.

    Let's talk about "thrift." The "National Agricultural Development Program" also writes very clearly: "Thrift means practicing strict economy, reducing production costs, and opposing extravagance and waste. All kinds of capital construction of cooperatives should make full use of the cooperative's own manpower, materials, and financial resources as much as possible." "Pay attention to introducing model examples of farmers' careful calculation, saving, increasing savings and accumulation." If there is only diligence and no thrift, one hand in, one hand out, it will not be possible to prosper the society or enrich the country.

    Since Chairman Mao praised our "poor stick cooperative" for running the cooperative diligently and thriftily in the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," in recent years, whether it is developing production, engaging in sideline businesses, or building water conservancy projects, adding machines, or running factories, our cooperative has never forgotten diligence and thrift, and has never spent money lavishly. I often say: "The funds in the cooperative are not falling from the sky, but are squeezed out by our commune members drop by drop from the cracks in the stones. We should spend one cent as two cents or several cents." Originally, a thousand days of collecting firewood cannot be burned in one day. Saving one cent is accumulating one more cent of funds for the country. We still have to act in accordance with the old rule of "spending less on what should be spent more, and spending as little as possible on what should be spent less." A happy life is like a mountain. We are now climbing up step by step. If we stop to enjoy ourselves for the moment, when will we be able to climb to the top? Only when everyone pays attention to diligence and thrift, and everyone rushes forward in the face of difficulties, can we completely drive away "poverty and blankness" and build a more happy paradise as soon as possible.

    勤俭是宝
    王国藩
    现在各行各业都在支援农业，咱农民该怎么鼓劲呢？我觉得最要紧的是不能依赖国家照顾，不当伸手派。咱们要进一步发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，“不怕多流汗，就能多增产。”
    要想迅速充实家底，说来说去离不了“勤”和“俭”两字。勤俭好比“聚宝盆”，是咱中国人民祖祖辈辈留下来的“传家宝”。咱们勤俭办事，不怕任何艰苦，用自己的双手撵走“一穷二白”。
    先拿“勤”字来说，《一九五六年到一九六七年全国农业发展纲要》说的好：“勤，就是要发动社员勤劳生产，在可能和必要条件下积极地扩大生产范围，发展多种经济，进行细致工作。”下面又特别提到各种基本建设，都应当尽量利用本身的人力、物力和财力。由此可见，发展农业就要勤劳从事，不要怕艰苦。
    前些日子，我们建明公社遇到这么一件事：国家为了支援我们向农业现代化进军，贷给我们三百五十万元的机器，原来说是让我们在三年到五年内还清。可是，社员们一核计：不行啊，咱社把这一大笔钱占上三年五载，就有可能影响国家的建设速度。我们不能光顾自己，不替国家着想。大伙决心要苦战一年还清贷款。人们说：“党和国家这么关心咱们、体贴咱们，咱们只有多加把劲儿才对。”怎么鼓劲呢？还得发扬“穷棒子”精神，用“三条驴腿”起家时的老办法，上山打柴取宝。说干就干，全社总动员，上山苦干、猛干，同时提取公共积累和发动社员投资，几下里齐头并进，结果，才四个月，就凑起了近百万元。社员们进一步认清了不怕艰苦，勤劳生产，就是促进农业现代化、夺取粮食丰收的主要因素。因此，不论在抗旱、播种、灭荒中，绝大部分社员都是艰苦奋斗，兢兢业业，战胜了一个连一个的困难。
    再说“俭”字，《全国农业发展纲要》上也写得很清楚：“俭，就是要厉行节约，降低生产成本，反对铺张浪费。合作社的各种基本建设，都应当尽量利用合作社本身的人力、物力和财力。”“注意介绍农家精打细算、省吃俭用、增加积蓄和积累的模范事例。”要是光有勤，没有俭，一手进，一手扔，那是兴不了社，富不了国的。
    自从毛主席在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》这本书里，表扬我们“穷棒子社”勤俭办社以后，这些年来，不管是发展生产、搞副业，还是兴修水利、添机器、办工厂，我社从来也没有忘记克勤克俭，从来也没有大手大脚地乱花钱。我常说：“社里的资金不是天上掉下来的，是咱们社员从石头缝里一滴一滴地挤出来的，咱们应当把一分钱当作两分钱或几分钱花。”本来，千日打柴不能一日烧。省一分钱，就是为国家多积累一分资金，咱们还得本着“该多花的少花，该少花的尽量不花”的老规矩办事。幸福的生活好比一座山，咱们现在正一步一步往上迈，要是为了眼前舒服一下，停下步来，什么时候才能爬到顶呢？只有人人注意勤俭，个个顶着困难向前赶，才能彻底赶走“一穷二白”，早日建设起更加幸福的乐园。〔原载《河北日报》〕
