Vigorously Collect Pine Resin, Increase Rosin Production
*People's Daily* Commentator

Rosin is an important raw material in industrial production. Its uses are extremely wide. Not only do industries such as papermaking, pharmaceuticals, rubber, printing and dyeing, and plastics need rosin, but metallurgy, electrical engineering, construction and other departments also directly or indirectly need rosin. Therefore, doing everything possible to increase rosin production to meet the needs of all aspects of the national economy is a major task for the Party committees, forestry and commercial departments of all rosin-producing areas.

To greatly increase rosin production, the first thing to do is to focus on the work of collecting pine resin and produce more resin. Technically speaking, collecting pine resin is not a very complicated matter, but pine resin production has the characteristics of being fluid, dispersed, and widespread, requiring a considerable amount of labor. Currently, it is a very busy season for agricultural work. In order to concentrate superior forces to strengthen the front line of agricultural production and ensure a bumper harvest of autumn crops, it is impossible and should not be expected to increase rosin production by increasing labor. Under these circumstances, can we increase the production of more resin with less labor? Yes, we can. Local experiences have proven that, under the condition of comprehensively arranging labor, establishing a small but highly skilled professional resin collection team is an effective way to increase labor efficiency and increase resin production. First, professional resin collection teams facilitate assembly line operations, enabling the allocation and utilization of new and old workers, full and semi-labor forces, to give full play to their respective strengths and make the best use of their talents. Second, the establishment of professional resin collection teams also facilitates planned production, unified leadership, and full utilization of resources. Third, professional resin collection teams also facilitate the exchange of experience, improvement of technology, and organization of labor competitions. Because the establishment of professional resin collection teams has many benefits as mentioned above, all regions that have implemented this method have achieved very good results. After the Puban People's Commune in Nanjiang County, Sichuan Province, organized a professional resin collection team, the number of people going up the mountain to collect resin in May decreased by 60% compared with the same period last year, while resin production increased by more than double. After Chong'an County, Fujian Province, organized the resin collection farmers who were scattered and mobile in the past into professional resin collection teams, labor efficiency generally increased by more than two times compared to before. If all rosin-producing areas in the country can universally implement the method of professional resin collection teams, then, without occupying too much labor, it is still possible to increase labor efficiency and achieve the goal of increasing resin production. Of course, in areas where pine resin resources are relatively scattered and it is not suitable to establish professional resin collection teams, it is also very necessary to widely mobilize the masses to combine with agricultural production and use the gaps in agricultural work to collect resin.

At present, there is a big difference between the high and low levels of resin collection in various places. Generally, each person can collect 20 catties per day, with high yields reaching 50 to 60 catties or even more than 100 catties, but the lowest is only three to five catties. The same is resin collection, but the difference is several times to dozens of times. What is the reason? Here, in addition to labor organization and production management factors, vigorously carrying out technological innovation and promoting advanced resin collection methods are of decisive significance. Since the Great Leap Forward, various places have created many new technologies for high-yield and bumper harvests of pine resin, such as chemical resin collection, intensive resin collection combined with felling, etc., which have greatly improved the resin collection rate. And many advanced resin collection technologies are simple and easy to implement. Li Zuoman, a resin collection worker in Jian'ou County, Fujian Province, based on his many years of resin collection experience, changed the past method of cutting resin once a day to rotating cuts every other day. Because the resin was replenished, the yield per tree increased by 20% to 30% compared to cutting once a day. When using the method of cutting once a day, he could manage a maximum of six to seven hundred trees per day. After changing to rotation cuts, the number of trees managed increased by one time. Because he created a new resin collection method, he collected more than 4,000 catties of resin in June this year alone, increasing resin collection efficiency by more than five times compared to the average. This fully demonstrates that technological innovation contains enormous potential for increasing production. As long as we continue to vigorously carry out mass technological innovation and technological revolution movements, help the masses summarize advanced experiences and promptly promote these experiences, we can quickly transform low-yield into high-yield on the pine resin production front, raise the backward production level to an advanced production level, and achieve a large-scale bumper harvest of pine resin production.

The current time is the golden season for collecting pine resin. Because the temperature is higher and the rainfall is abundant between July and October every year, and the trees grow vigorously, the amount of pine resin secretion is one to four times more than in other months. Therefore, whether this year's annual rosin production task can be completed depends on whether the peak season for resin collection is well grasped. The peak season for resin collection this year has passed for more than a month, and there are still more than two months left. Time waits for no one. The leading departments of each rosin-producing area should firmly grasp the current favorable opportunity, go deep into the front line of resin collection, strengthen specific leadership over resin collection work, mobilize the masses to do everything possible to improve resin collection efficiency, and collect large amounts of pine resin, and strive to produce more rosin.

    大采松脂，增产松香
    本报评论员
    松香，这是工业生产中一种重要原料。它的用途极为广泛。不仅造纸、制药、橡胶、印染、塑料等工业生产需要松香，冶金、电工、建筑等部门也直接或间接地需要松香。因此，千方百计地增产松香，以满足国民经济各方面的需要，这是一切松香产区党委、林业和商业部门的一项重大任务。
    要大量增产松香，首先要抓好采割松脂工作，增产更多的松脂。采割松脂，从技术上来说，并不是一件很复杂的事情，但是松脂生产有着流动、分散、面广的特点，需要相当数量的劳动力。当前正是农事十分繁忙季节，为了集中优势兵力加强农业生产第一线，确保秋季作物丰收，不可能也不应当指望用增加劳动力的办法增产松脂。在这种情况下，能否以较少的人力增产更多的松脂呢？是能够的。各地经验证明，在全面安排好劳动力的条件下，建立人数不多但很精悍的专业采脂队伍，就是提高劳动效率增产松脂的有效方法。首先，专业采脂队便于实行流水作业，使新、老工人，全、半劳力搭配调用，发挥各自专长，作到人尽其力；其次，建立专业采脂队又便于计划生产，统一领导，充分利用资源；第三，专业采脂队还便于交流经验、提高技术和组织劳动竞赛。由于建立专业采脂队有上述很多好处，因而凡是推行了这一办法的地区，都收到了很好的效果。四川省南江县菩般人民公社组织采脂专业队以后，5月份内与去年同期比较，上山采脂人数减少60％，而松脂产量却增加了一倍多；福建省崇安县把过去分散流动生产的采脂农民组织成专业采脂队以后，劳动效率较前普遍提高了两倍以上。如果全国各松脂产区都能普遍推行专业采脂队的方法，那么，在不占用过多的劳动力的情况下，仍然可以提高劳动效率，达到增产松脂的目的。当然，在松脂资源比较分散、不宜建立采脂专业队的地区，广泛发动群众结合农业生产，利用农事间隙进行采脂，也是十分必要的。
    目前各地采割松脂的水平高低之间相差很多。一般每人每天可采二十斤，高的五六十斤乃至一百多斤，但是最低的只有三、五斤。同样是采脂，却相差几倍到几十倍，原因何在？这里除了劳动组织和生产管理的因素外，大搞技术革新，推广先进的采脂方法具有决定性的意义。大跃进以来，各地创造了许多松脂高产丰收的新技术，例如化学采脂、结合采伐进行强度采脂等等，都大大提高了采脂率。而许多先进采脂技术都是简单易行的。福建省建瓯县采脂工人李作慢，根据他多年的采脂经验，把过去一天一割的采脂方法改为隔天轮割以后，由于树脂得到了补充，每株树产量比一天一割增加了20％至30％。采用一天一割的方法时，他每天最多管六、七百株树，改为轮割以后，管树增加了一倍，由于他创造了新的采脂方法，在今年6月一个月当中就采了四千多斤松脂，比一般采脂效率提高五倍多。这就充分说明，技术革新蕴藏着巨大的增产潜力。只要我们不断地大搞群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，帮助群众总结先进经验并及时推广这些经验，在松脂生产战线上就可以迅速地变低产为高产，把落后的生产水平提到先进的生产水平上来，使松脂生产获得大面积丰收。
    当前正是采割松脂的黄金季节。由于每年7月至10月间气温较高，雨水充沛，树木生长旺盛，松脂分泌量要比其它月份多一倍到四倍。因此，今年全年松香生产任务能否完成，关键在于是否抓好了旺季采脂。今年的采脂旺季已经过去了一个多月，还有两个多月的时间。机不可失，各松脂产区领导部门应当狠狠抓住当前的有利时机，深入采脂第一线，加强对采脂工作的具体领导，发动群众千方百计地提高采脂效率，大量采割松脂，为增产更多的松香而努力。
