Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th August. The Shenyang-Jilin, Shenyang-Dalian, and Liaoyang-Benxi railway lines in Liaoning Province, which were temporarily interrupted by floods, have been completely restored after heroic rescue efforts.

From August 1st to 4th, the Shenji, Shenda, Shenyang-Andong, and Liaoxi railway lines in Liaoning Province were successively hit by floods. The Shenji line was damaged in twenty-four places by the water, and the Shenda line in forty places. After the flood disaster occurred, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately made restoring railway transportation the focus of the province's struggle against floods and disasters. The Party Committee of the Shenyang Railway Bureau held an emergency telephone conference on the 3rd, immediately forming a flood prevention and rescue army of more than 20,000 employees, and mobilized more than 600 trainloads of rescue materials to invest in the rescue battle. Many leading cadres of the Railway Bureau's Party Committee, such as the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, went deep into key sections of the Shenji, Shenda, and Shenan lines to lead the flood prevention and rescue struggle.

The five-kilometer section between Shenyang and Anshan on the Shenda line suffered the most severe damage. The tracks were overturned by the water, and telephone lines were cut off. The three thousand railway employees and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army responsible for repairing this section launched a heated competition. By noon on the 6th, the uplink line had been safely opened to traffic. On the morning of the 7th, the downlink line was also repaired. The section from Fushun City to Qiandian on the Shenji line was cut off by a 280-meter section of flood on the 3rd. After less than thirteen hours of repair, it was restored. All twenty-four places damaged by the water on the entire line have now been completely repaired.

At present, the bridges and lines of the Shenan line damaged by the flood are still being repaired. The railway lines in the Dalian area were cut off in sixteen places by floods in one day on the 5th, but after the railway employees repaired them as they were broken, all of them were restored and opened to traffic in three days. Twenty-two flood damages occurred on the line from Shenyang to Changchun, and after repairing them as they were broken, the entire line has also been restored and opened to traffic.

The battle to repair the railway lines received strong support from all sides. Railway employees in areas not affected by the flood launched intense support activities. Railway employees in the Shenyang area transferred 647 trainloads of cinder, rubble, grass bags and other repair materials in three days from August 2nd to 4th, as well as more than 4,000 various repair tools, and at the same time transferred more than 3,000 employees and dozens of medical personnel to the repair front. Support for the repair also came from officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, members of the people's communes, factory and mine workers, government cadres, and school students.

Currently, the Shenyang Railway Bureau has increased a large number of track inspectors along the railway line in dangerous sections and, together with the residents along the line, guards them day and night in sections, with a hundredfold vigilance, to prevent even greater floods.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th August. Under the leadership of the Party, the rural people's communes in the Fushun area of Liaoning Province, with heroic and tenacious will, after overcoming the unprecedented torrential rain and flood attacks in decades, are continuing to strengthen flood control efforts while vigorously grasping post-disaster production, and are universally launching a shock movement to drain water to save seedlings and rush to harvest and replant.

From August 1st to 4th, the Fushun area was hit by torrential rains, causing mountain floods and rapidly rising river waters, resulting in the inundation of some farmland. However, under the leadership of the Party, the vast number of rural cadres and commune members gave full play to the superiority of the people's communes and, after heroic fighting, repelled the attacks of torrential rains and floods within a few days, winning the victory of flood control and disaster relief. As soon as the heavy rain stopped, they actively organized more than 70% of the strong labor force to engage in the struggle of draining water to protect seedlings, rushing to harvest and replant. The Qingyuan County Party Committee held a special meeting on August 4th to discuss disaster relief and seedling protection measures, arranging drainage and seedling replanting, rushing to harvest and replant, strengthening late-stage autumn field management, accumulating fertilizer, and resettling disaster-stricken households at the same time, comprehensively promoting the work. The Nankouqian Commune, which acted the fastest, drained water and replanted seedlings on more than 7,000 mu, and rushed to plant autumn vegetables and buckwheat on 300 mu after three days of fierce fighting. In terms of drainage, they adopted ditch drainage, first draining short crops and then tall crops; first supporting tall crops and then short crops. In terms of rushing to plant, they first planted high-lying sandy land and then low-lying land. Therefore, the progress was fast and the quality was good.

    辽宁军民继续和洪水英勇斗争
    沈吉、沈大、辽溪线被冲坏路段已修复，正警惕防备更大洪水
    抚顺地区人民公社集中强壮劳力积极排水保苗、抢收抢种
    新华社沈阳9日电　被洪水袭击一度中断的辽宁省沈（阳）吉（林）、沈（阳）大（连）两条铁路干线和辽（阳）溪（本溪）线，经过英勇抢救，已经全部修复。
    辽宁省沈吉、沈大、沈（阳）安（东）和辽溪等铁路线从8月1日到4日先后受到洪水袭击。沈吉线曾被水冲坏二十四处，沈大线冲坏了四十处。水害发生后，中共辽宁省委立即以恢复铁路运输为全省抗洪抗灾斗争的重点。沈阳铁路局党委在3日召开紧急电话会议，立即组成由二万多名职工参加的防洪抢险大军，调集六百多车抢险材料，投入抢险战斗。铁路局党委书记、副书记等许多领导干部都深入沈吉、沈大和沈安等线重点地段，领导防洪抢险斗争。
    沈大线沈阳到鞍山之间有五公里线路受害最严重。路轨被水冲翻，电话线路中断。负责抢修这一路段的三千铁路职工和解放军官兵展开热烈竞赛。6日中午，上行线已安全通车。7日晨，下行线也随即修复。沈吉线抚顺城到前甸一段，3日曾被洪水冲断线路二百八十米，经过不到十三小时的抢修，就已修复。全线被水冲坏的二十四处，现在也已全部修复。
    目前，沈安线遭受水害的桥梁和线路仍在继续抢修。大连地区的铁路线在5日一天内，曾被洪水冲断十六处，经过铁路职工随断随修，三天就全部修复通车。沈阳到长春的线路发生二十二处水害，经随断随修，也已全线修复通车。
    修复铁路线的战斗得到了各方面的大力支援。没有受水害地区的铁路职工都展开紧张的支前活动。沈阳地区铁路职工从8月2日到4日，三天就调出炉灰、块石、草袋等抢修材料六百四十七车，各种抢修工具四千多件，同时抽调三千多名职工和几十名医务人员奔赴抢修前线。支援抢修的还有解放军官兵、人民公社社员、厂矿职工、机关干部和学校学生等。
    现在，沈阳铁路局在铁路沿线险要地段已经增加了大批巡道员和沿线居民一起，分段日夜看守，百倍警惕，防备更大的洪水。
    新华社沈阳9日电　辽宁抚顺地区各农村人民公社在党的领导下，以英勇顽强的意志，战胜了几十年来所未有的暴雨洪水袭击以后，正一面继续加强防汛斗争，一面狠抓灾后生产，普遍掀起排水救苗和抢收抢种的突击运动。
    抚顺地区8月1日到4日连遭暴雨袭击，山洪暴发，河水猛涨，致使部分农田积水淹没。但是，广大农村干部和公社社员在党的领导下，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，经过英勇奋战，几天以内就击退了暴雨和洪水的袭击，取得了抗洪抢险的胜利。大雨一停，就积极组织起70％以上的强壮劳动力，投入排水保苗、抢收抢种的斗争。清原县委在8月4日召开专门会议讨论了抗灾保苗措施，把排水补苗、抢收抢种、加强后期秋田管理、积肥、以及安置受灾户等工作同时安排，全面推进。行动最快的南口前公社，经过三天激战，就排水补苗七千多亩，抢种秋菜和荞麦三百亩。他们在排水方面，采取挖沟排水，先排矮棵作物，后排高秆作物；先扶高秆作物，后扶矮棵作物。在抢种方面，先种高地沙地后种低洼地。因此，进度快质量好。
