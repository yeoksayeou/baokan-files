    Eighty Thousand Jin of Chemical Fertilizer
    On the road leading to the Wuzhuang Brigade of the Suburbs Commune of Biyang City, a long string of horse-drawn carts carrying chemical fertilizer kicked up dust that filled the sky. Leading the carts was Yue Wansheng, the Party Branch Secretary of the commune's chemical fertilizer factory, along with the factory director, technicians... They were delivering the eighty thousand jin of chemical fertilizer they had produced to the production brigade in time to support autumn production.
    A few days earlier, Yue Wansheng, representing all the workers of the factory, had come to the Wuzhuang Brigade to inquire whether they had enough fertilizer. Zhang Chenggang, the Party Branch Secretary of the brigade, said, "In previous years, the fertilizer would have been sufficient. This year, we want to strive for a greater autumn harvest, so we need to apply fertilizer one more time as topdressing. Currently, the brigade is still short of eighty thousand jin of chemical fertilizer." "Okay, we will definitely find a way to increase fertilizer production and support your super-production campaign," Yue Wansheng said. After returning to the factory, Yue Wansheng launched a fertilizer production increase competition among all the factory's employees. The workers of the chemical fertilizer factory knew that the crops were waiting with open mouths to "eat," so they only took seven days to produce eighty thousand jin of fertilizer in a crash effort. On August 22nd, the branch secretary, the factory director, and the off-duty workers personally drove the carts to deliver the fertilizer to their doorstep. Zhao Fazhang, the production team leader, said emotionally, "The elder brothers of the chemical fertilizer factory completed the task of producing fertilizer ahead of schedule. They didn't even wait for us to pick it up and delivered it to our door. What kind of style is this?" The commune members replied, "We must learn from the communist style of the elder brothers, ensure a greater harvest of grain, and strive for a better autumn harvest!" The entire brigade immediately launched a super-production competition centered on managing the autumn fields well.

    八万斤化学肥料
    通往泌阳城郊公社吴庄大队的道路上，一长串运送化学肥料的马车，趟起了满天的尘土。赶车的是公社化肥厂党支部书记岳万省，还有厂长、技术员……他们把增产出来的八万斤化学肥料，及时送到生产大队，支援秋季生产。
    几天以前，岳万省代表全厂工人来到了吴庄大队，打听这里的肥料足不足。大队党总支书记张成刚说：“要照往年，肥料就够用了。今年要争取秋季得到更多的收成，就得再施一次追肥，目前全队还缺化肥八万斤。”“好，我们一定想办法增产化肥，支援你们的超产运动。”岳万省回厂以后，就发动全厂职工开展增产化肥的竞赛。化肥厂的职工，知道庄稼正在张着嘴等着“吃”呢，只用了七天的时间就突击生产出八万斤化肥。8月22日，支部书记、厂长和歇班的工人亲自赶车把肥料送上了门。生产小队长赵法章感动地说：“化肥厂的老大哥们提前完成了生产化肥的任务，不等咱去取，就送上门来了，这是什么风格？”社员们回答说：“我们要学习老大哥的共产主义风格，保证多打粮食，争取秋季收成更好！”全大队立即开展了以管好秋田为中心的超产竞赛。
