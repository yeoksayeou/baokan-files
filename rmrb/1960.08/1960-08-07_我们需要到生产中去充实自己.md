    We Need to Enrich Ourselves by Going into Production

    Our research institute has been using a two-pronged approach, combining top-down methods (research at the institute and practical work in the communes) for two years now. Over the past two years, I have deeply realized that production needs us, and we also need to practice in production.

    In late April of this year, when the early rice was lush green and entering the initial tillering stage, a commune member from Langping Commune in Bobai County suddenly ran to tell us that some rice seedlings were showing symptoms of yellow dwarf disease, but they couldn't figure out the cause. We immediately split up and went into the fields to inspect. As a result, we found it was caused by young nymphs of the white-winged planthopper. At that time, the occurrence of this pest was likely to affect the early rice harvest. So, we immediately reported to the Party committee and took effective measures. First, we carried out a typical eradication campaign in the Lüzhū Brigade, and then mobilized other commune brigades to come and visit and learn. The pest control campaign quickly spread throughout the county, and within a few days, the pests were completely eliminated.

    The white-winged planthopper is a serious pest in Guangxi, but the research institute had not included it in its research projects for many years. After this pest control effort in Bobai County, the institute immediately sent personnel from the plant protection department to conduct further inspection and research. Through in-depth research, not only were the pest control measures taken by our resident team further confirmed from a scientific theoretical perspective, but they were also summarized as one of the important research topics for pest and disease prevention and control in the entire autonomous region.

    The production site has opened up a vast world for our scientific research. Today, when all walks of life are vigorously supporting agriculture, we must enrich ourselves through production practice and better serve agricultural production and construction.

    我们需要到生产中去充实自己
    我们研究所采用两套人马、上下结合（在所研究和驻社实践）的方法，开展研究活动已经两年了。两年来，我深深地体会到生产需要我们，我们也需要到生产中去实践。
    今年4月下旬，正当早稻一片翠绿，进入初蘖时期，博白县浪平公社一个社员突然跑来告诉我们，有些禾苗发生黄萎现象，但找不出是什么原因。我们立即分头深入田间进行检查，结果，发现是白翅叶蝻幼龄虫害。当时出现这种虫害，很可能影响早稻丰收，于是我们马上一面向党委汇报，一面采取有效措施，首先在绿珠大队进行典型扑灭，然后发动其他公社大队前来参观学习。灭害活动很快扩及全县，不几天，虫害就全部消灭了。
    白翅叶蝻虫害是广西一种严重的病虫害，但是研究所多年来一直没列入研究课题。经过博白县这次灭害后，所里马上派植物保护系人员作进一步的检查研究。经过深入研究，不仅对我们驻社小组采取的灭虫措施，从科学理论上进一步证实，而且总结为全自治区防治病虫害重要研究课题之一。
    生产现场为我们科学研究开辟了广阔天地，在各行各业大张旗鼓支援农业的今天，我们要在生产实践中充实自己，更好地为农业生产建设服务。
