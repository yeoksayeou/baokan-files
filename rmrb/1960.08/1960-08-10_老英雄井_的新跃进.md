The entire staff of the "Old Hero Well" in the Nantong Coal Mine, Sichuan, achieved high production in every shift in July, completing the monthly leap forward plan six and a half days ahead of schedule, and producing 3,005 tons of raw coal in twenty-four and a half days, equivalent to 2.2 times the total monthly output in June.

"No difficulty before heroes" is their main characteristic in winning high and abundant yields. In order to increase labor productivity, the old heroes took the lead in launching the "one person doing the work of several" high-efficiency competition. Yin Peiqing, an old miner in his fifties, used a bamboo basket to transport coal and created a new record of transporting 130 times in one shift, realizing one person doing the work of two. In order to save pit props, the old heroes adopted methods such as tunneling small holes and making simple sheds. When many old ruins and a lot of gangue were found underground, affecting transportation, the old heroes used the method of digging mountains and filling valleys to keep the gangue out of the well, which not only mined more coal but also reduced the transportation burden.

    “老英雄井”的新跃进
    四川南桐煤矿“老英雄井”的全体职工，七月份做到班班高产，提前六天半完成了全月跃进计划，二十四天半共产原煤三千零五吨，相当于六月全月产量的二点二倍。
    “英雄面前无困难”，是他们夺得高额丰产的主要特点。为了提高劳动生产率，老英雄们带头开展“一顶几”的高工效竞赛。年过半百的老矿工尹沛清，用竹箕运煤，创造了一小班运一百三十次的新纪录，实现了一人顶二人。为了节约坑木，老英雄们采取了掘进开小眼、做简棚等办法。当井下发现老墟多、出的矸子多，影响运输的时候，老英雄们就用挖山填山的办法，使矸子不出井，既多挖了煤炭，又减少了运输负担。
