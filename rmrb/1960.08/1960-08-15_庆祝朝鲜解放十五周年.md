    Celebrating the 15th Anniversary of the Liberation of Korea
    Today is the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea. The Chinese people, with boundless joy, join the fraternal Korean people in celebrating the glorious festival of the Korean people. Over the past fifteen years, the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung, have made brilliant achievements in socialist construction and great victories in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of their national independence. Our people extend our heartfelt congratulations on this!
    The heroic Korean people, under the bloody rule of Japanese imperialism for thirty-six years, carried out a relentless and indomitable struggle, and finally, on this day fifteen years ago—August 15, 1945—with the help of the Soviet army, liberated the northern half of Korea. Just as the Korean people began to realize their ideals on the liberated land of their motherland, US imperialism launched the Korean War on June 25, 1950, in an attempt to conquer the Korean nation by force and strangle the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea. However, in the face of the indomitable Korean people, US imperialism, like Japanese imperialism, suffered a shameful defeat. History has repeatedly proved that the heroic Korean nation will not be conquered by any imperialism. Today, Korea stands even more firmly on the eastern outpost of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    Fifteen years is but a short moment for Korea with its long history, but during this period, great changes have taken place in Korea's political, economic, and cultural aspects. Especially in the more than seven years since the armistice, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, has formulated a series of correct guidelines and policies for socialist construction, leading the people to rapidly heal the serious wounds of war and advance at high speed along the socialist road. After completing the post-war three-year plan ahead of schedule, the Korean people completed the industrial output value plan of the first five-year plan two and a half years ahead of schedule in June 1959. Last year, Korea's total industrial output value increased by 5.6 times compared with 1944 before liberation. At present, the total output value of Korean industry accounts for 71% of the total output value of industry and agriculture. As early as August 1958, agricultural cooperation was fully realized in the rural areas of northern Korea. The realization of agricultural cooperation has greatly increased the yield of crops in northern Korea. At present, the Korean people are further striving to realize agricultural mechanization in three or four years. Before liberation, Korea was a colonial agricultural country. After fifteen years of hard work by the Korean people, it has become an industrial-agricultural country today. At present, the Korean people are riding the "Chollima" and advancing confidently from one victory to another on the road to socialism.
    In contrast, South Korea, under the rule of US imperialism and its puppet regime, has been reduced to a living hell of poverty and starvation. The stark contrast between the northern and southern halves of Korea fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system established in the north.
    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has consistently made unremitting efforts to safeguard Far Eastern and world peace. In particular, the Korean people have waged a resolute struggle against the aggression of US imperialism, making a great contribution to Far Eastern and world peace. As everyone knows, US imperialism, like Japanese imperialism, has always regarded the invasion of Korea as the first step in invading China and the entire Far East. Therefore, fifteen years ago, from the first day it occupied South Korea, US imperialism violated international agreements, occupied South Korea, and turned South Korea into a US military base and colony, causing the division of Korean territory and seriously threatening Far Eastern and world peace. Later, US imperialism brazenly launched the Korean War to realize its ambition of first annexing Korea, then attacking China, and dominating the Far East and the world. The heroic Korean people, fighting side by side with the Chinese People's Volunteers, with the support of peace-loving people of all countries, finally shattered the US imperialist aggression plan and forced US imperialism to accept the armistice. The fact that the Korean War ended with the great victory of the Korean and Chinese people and the disastrous defeat of US imperialism once again exposed US imperialism as a paper tiger and proved that relying on the unity and struggle of the people, even the most ferocious US imperialism can be defeated.
    The Korean people have waged a long and resolute struggle to realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland. In the seven years since the Korean armistice, the Korean and Chinese sides have strictly abided by the armistice agreement and made every effort to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. However, US imperialism has stubbornly obstructed the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and has tried every means to undermine the armistice agreement; frantically supporting the South Korean puppet clique; transporting atomic weapons and missile weapons into South Korea, and establishing rocket bases in South Korea; especially after Eisenhower's "visit" to South Korea, US imperialism stepped up its war provocations. Recently, the US invading army has conducted shooting exercises with rockets and atomic simulation bombs in South Korea. Magruder, commander-in-chief of the US forces invading Korea, openly clamored that there is a "possibility of another Korean war." Moreover, more than a year after the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, the US invading army is still unwilling to withdraw from South Korea to this day. All these facts clearly show that US imperialism has not abandoned its criminal policy of obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, and has never given up its conspiracy to launch a new aggression.
    US imperialism's criminal policy of aggression and war in South Korea for the past fifteen years has today tasted its own bitter fruit. Not long ago, the South Korean people launched a storm against US imperialism and its running dogs. The US imperialist running dog Syngman Rhee has been overthrown, and the people's patriotic and just struggle has achieved initial victory. This has greatly encouraged and supported the just struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all countries in the world. Our people firmly support the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people.
    China and Korea are fraternal neighbors as close as lips and teeth. The Yalu River connects the lands of the two countries, and the people of our two countries have a traditional friendship. During the difficult years of our people's War of Resistance Against Japan and War of Liberation, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people supported our people with their blood; during the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War against US imperialist aggression, our people sent their outstanding sons and daughters—the Chinese People's Volunteers—to fight side by side with the Korean people against the US aggressors. The people of China and Korea sincerely call the friendship between us a "friendship cemented in blood." Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the unbreakable fraternal friendship and close cooperation between the people of China and Korea have been consolidated and developed day by day. The people of China and Korea support each other and cooperate with each other in the struggle against US imperialism and in the cause of socialist construction. This friendship between the people of China and Korea is a brilliant example of proletarian internationalist solidarity. On the occasion of Korea's glorious national festival—the 15th anniversary of liberation—we would like to express our heartfelt wishes to the fraternal Korean people: May the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Korea flow endlessly like the water of the Yalu River! We wish the Korean people even more brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist construction! We wish the Korean people new victories in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland!

### 庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年

    庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年
    今天是朝鲜解放十五周年。中国人民以无比欢欣的心情，同兄弟般的朝鲜人民一起，庆祝朝鲜人民的光荣节日。十五年来，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党和金日成同志的领导下，在社会主义建设中取得了辉煌的成就，在反对帝国主义、保卫祖国独立的斗争中取得了伟大的胜利，我国人民对此表示衷心的祝贺！
    英雄的朝鲜人民，在日本帝国主义三十六年的血腥统治下，进行了前仆后继、不屈不挠的斗争，终于在十五年前的今天——1945年8月15日，在苏联军队的帮助下，解放了朝鲜的北半部。当朝鲜人民刚刚开始在解放了的祖国土地上实现自己理想的时候，美帝国主义又在1950年6月25日发动了侵朝战争，妄图用武力征服朝鲜民族，扼死年轻的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。然而，在不屈不挠的朝鲜人民面前，美帝国主义同日本帝国主义一样遭到了可耻的失败。历史一再证明，英勇的朝鲜民族是不会被任何帝国主义所征服的。今天，朝鲜更加坚强地屹立在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的东方前哨。
    十五年，对于具有悠久历史的朝鲜来说，只不过是短短的一瞬，然而，在这一期间，朝鲜的政治、经济和文化各方面都发生了伟大的变革。特别是在停战后的七年多以来，以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党中央，制订了一系列正确的社会主义建设的方针和政策，领导人民迅速地医好了严重的战争创伤，沿着社会主义的道路高速度地前进。继提前完成战后三年计划之后，1959年6月底，朝鲜人民又提前两年半完成了第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划。去年朝鲜工业总产值同解放前的1944年比较已增长了五点六倍。目前，朝鲜工业的总产值已占工农业总产值的71％。而早在1958年8月，朝鲜北半部农村中已全部实现了农业合作化。农业合作化的实现使朝鲜北半部的农作物产量大大提高。目前，朝鲜人民正在进一步争取在三、四年内实现农业机械化。解放前，朝鲜原是一个殖民地农业国，经过朝鲜人民十五年来的辛勤劳动，今天已变成一个工业—农业国。目前，朝鲜人民正跨上“千里马”，在社会主义的道路上，满怀信心地从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。
    而与此相反，在美帝国主义及其傀儡政权统治下的南朝鲜，却沦为一个民生雕蔽、饿殍载道的人间地狱。朝鲜北半部和南半部情况的鲜明对比，充分地证明了在北半部建立的社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一贯为维护远东和世界和平进行坚持不懈的努力。特别是朝鲜人民对美帝国主义的侵略进行了坚决的斗争，为远东和世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。大家知道，美帝国主义和日本帝国主义一样，一直把侵略朝鲜看成侵略中国和整个远东的第一步。因此，在十五年前，美帝国主义从占领南朝鲜的第一天起，就违反了国际协定，霸占南朝鲜，把南朝鲜变成美国的军事基地和殖民地，使朝鲜的国土陷于分裂，使远东和世界和平遭到严重的威胁。后来，美帝国主义终于悍然发动侵朝战争，以实现其首先并吞朝鲜，然后进攻中国，称霸远东和世界的野心。英勇的朝鲜人民，同中国人民志愿军并肩作战，在爱好和平的各国人民的支援下，终于粉碎了美帝国主义的侵略计划，并迫使美帝国主义接受停战。朝鲜战争以朝中人民的伟大胜利和美帝国主义的惨重失败而告终的这一事实，再一次戳穿了美帝国主义纸老虎，并且证明：依靠人民的团结和斗争，即使是最凶恶的美帝国主义也是可以被战胜的。
    朝鲜人民为了实现祖国的和平统一，曾经进行了长期的坚决的斗争。朝鲜停战后的七年中，朝中方面严格遵守停战协定，为谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决竭尽一切的努力。然而，美帝国主义却一直顽固地阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，百般破坏停战协定；疯狂地扶植南朝鲜傀儡集团；把原子武器和导弹武器运入南朝鲜，在南朝鲜建立火箭基地；特别是在艾森豪威尔“访问”南朝鲜之后，美帝国主义加紧了战争挑衅活动。最近，美国侵略军又在南朝鲜进行火箭和原子模拟弹的射击演习。侵朝美军总司令马格鲁德竟公开叫嚣有“发生另一次朝鲜战争的可能”。而且，在中国人民志愿军全部撤离朝鲜已经一年多以后，直到今天美国侵略军还赖在南朝鲜不愿撤走。所有这些事实都清楚地说明：美帝国主义没有放弃阻挠朝鲜和平统一的罪恶政策，而且也从来没有放弃重新发动侵略的阴谋。
    美帝国主义十五年来在南朝鲜执行罪恶的侵略政策和战争政策，今天已经自食其恶果。不久以前，南朝鲜人民掀起了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的风暴，美帝国主义的走狗李承晚已被赶下了台，人民的爱国正义斗争获得了初步的胜利。大大鼓舞了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民以及全世界各国人民的正义斗争以极大的鼓舞和支持。我国人民坚决支持南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争。
    中朝两国是唇齿相依的兄弟邻邦。一条鸭绿江接连起两国的土地，我们两国人民有着传统的友谊。在我国人民进行抗日战争和解放战争的艰苦岁月里，朝鲜人民的优秀儿女以鲜血支援了我国人民；在朝鲜人民进行反抗美帝国主义侵略的祖国解放战争中，我国人民派遣了自己优秀的儿女——中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民并肩反击美国侵略者。中朝两国人民把我们之间的友谊诚挚地称之为“鲜血凝成的友谊”。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，中朝两国人民的牢不可破的兄弟友谊和亲密合作日益巩固，不断发展。中朝两国人民无论在反对美帝国主义的斗争中，或是在社会主义建设事业中，都是互相支援，彼此合作。中朝两国人民的这种友谊是无产阶级国际主义团结的光辉范例。当此朝鲜光荣的民族节日——解放十五周年来临的时候，我们谨向兄弟般的朝鲜人民表示衷心的祝愿：祝中朝两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊像鸭绿江水一样长流不息！祝朝鲜人民在社会主义建设事业中取得更加辉煌的成就！祝朝鲜人民在争取祖国和平统一的斗争中取得新的胜利！
