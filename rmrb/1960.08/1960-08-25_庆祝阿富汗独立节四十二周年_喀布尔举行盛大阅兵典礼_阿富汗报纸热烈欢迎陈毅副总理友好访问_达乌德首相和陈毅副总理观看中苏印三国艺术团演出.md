Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, August 23rd: The Afghan people celebrated the glorious 42nd anniversary of their country's Independence Day on August 23rd.  Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's  Republic  of  China who  is currently on a friendly visit to Afghanistan, was invited to attend the grand military parade held annually at Chaman Square in Kabul.

　　Colorful arches were erected in Chaman Square and the nearby streets.  The solemn and beautiful Afghan national flag fluttered in the wind.  From early morning, Kabul citizens dressed in festive attire gathered around Chaman Square.  The streets leading to the square, and even the rooftops of many buildings, were filled with joyful crowds.

　　At 7:20 AM, His Majesty King Mohammed Zahir of Afghanistan arrived at Chaman Square by car.  The crowd in the venue rose to applaud and cheer him.

　　After the gun salute, King Zahir delivered a speech celebrating Independence Day.  Then the King went to the reviewing stand.  The King received Marshal Chen Yi and invited him to review the troops on the reviewing stand together. A military band of approximately three hundred people, playing majestic military music, marched in front of the reviewing stand.  At this moment, three helicopters circled over Chaman Square, scattering colorful confetti celebrating the festival.  Students from the Afghan Military Academy marched into the square with neat steps.  Following them were infantry units arranged in formation.  Motorized infantry units, artillery units, and tank units followed closely behind.  Cavalry units riding majestic steeds passed the reviewing stand.  Jet aircraft formations flew over the reviewing stand.  They also performed aerobatic maneuvers.

　　Particularly noteworthy in the reviewed troops were the two cannons that had rendered meritorious service in the famous battle that defeated the British invaders in 1919.  When these two cannons, decorated with garlands and symbolizing the Afghan people's spirit of resisting aggression and defending independence, passed through the square, people automatically stood up and applauded warmly.

　　Marshal Chen Yi and his entourage were excited to see that Afghanistan, this friendly neighbor, possessed such a strong armed force to defend the motherland and defend peace.

　　The grand military parade lasted for one and a half hours. After King Zahir received the leaders of the Royal Government of Afghanistan, he left the reviewing stand by car.

　　Accompanied by Afghan Deputy Prime Minister Sardar Mohammed Naim, Vice Premier Chen Yi returned to his residence at the Sadarat Palace by car. Along the way, he witnessed the Afghan people celebrating their festival.

　　The Afghan newspaper "Islah" published an editorial on the 22nd celebrating Afghanistan's Independence Day. This editorial expressed the feelings of the Afghan people celebrating Independence Day.

　　The editorial said: "Independence is the greatest pride for everyone on this land." The editorial also said that Afghanistan has always been considered a nation that fought for freedom. However, if a nation does not create conditions to defend independence after achieving it, it may still be controlled by others. Independence then becomes an empty name.

　　The editorial also said that in order to maintain independence, it is necessary to pursue wise policies in the current era. It said: "Our domestic policy is to improve the people's living standards; our foreign policy is also in line with the people's aspirations." Referring to the implementation of the first five-year plan in Afghanistan in recent years, the editorial said that significant achievements have been made in this regard. It said, "This is inseparable from correct leadership. However, we must never be satisfied with the current situation. We must work every day, and do better every day."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, August 23rd: The Afghan newspaper "Hiwad" published an editorial on August 21st entitled "Our Dear Guest, His Excellency Chen Yi," stating that the Afghan people, being inherently hospitable, attach particular importance and respect to every guest, especially those from countries that have friendly relations with us.

　　The editorial said that for hundreds of years, the Afghan people have maintained friendly relations with the Chinese people. Both of our peoples adhere to the principles of good neighborliness and mutual respect. The editorial said that in the hearts of the Afghan people, or in their history books, the word China is recorded as beautiful and kind. This is the reason why friendly relations have existed between China and Afghanistan for hundreds of years. Although Afghanistan and China have different political, social, and economic systems, the friendship and cooperation between Afghanistan and China are developing day by day. The editorial also said that China has made great achievements in less than eleven years since its founding, and it now belongs to the ranks of great and advanced countries in the world. The editorial said that we are pleased with the progress made by our friendly neighbor. Although our relationship with China has long been friendly, this relationship has now undergone tremendous development. The editorial said that mutual visits between the national leaders of China and Afghanistan have greatly helped to further develop the relations between our two countries. The exchange of art and cultural delegations has also promoted mutual understanding and left good impressions on each other.

　　The editorial concluded by saying that the entire Afghan people sincerely welcome their dear guest and wish Vice Premier Chen Yi good health and a pleasant stay in Kabul; and hope that he will bring the warm and friendly feelings of the Afghan people back to China.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, August 24th: At the invitation of the Afghan News and Publishing Department, the Chinese, Soviet, and Indian art troupes, which came to perform to celebrate Afghanistan's Independence Day, gave their first performance at the "Kabul Theater" yesterday evening.

　　Afghan Prime Minister Daoud, Deputy Prime Minister Ali Mohammed, and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Naim watched the performance.

　　Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and his entourage were also invited to watch the performance.

　　Mohammed Asef Sohel, Director of the Afghan News and Publishing Department, delivered a speech before the performance began. He said that strengthening cultural ties is one of the best ways to develop friendly relations between countries. He also said, "According to our historical and traditional policy of neutrality, we, the Afghan people, hope to understand the arts and cultures of other countries and to familiarize the people of other countries with our culture and way of life, so that we can serve world peace and social justice."

　　Wen Fei, head of the Chinese Youth Art Troupe, also delivered a speech before the performance. He said that not long ago, the Chinese people saw the beautiful artistic performances of the Afghan Art Troupe visiting China. This time, the Chinese Youth Art Troupe came here to give performances for the Afghan people to celebrate Afghanistan's Independence Day. At the same time, it will learn the beautiful Afghan national art from Afghan artists.

　　This performance was warmly welcomed by the audience. After the performance, Afghan Prime Minister Daoud and Chinese Vice Premier Chen Yi went on stage to present flower baskets to the Chinese, Soviet, and Indian artists.

    新华社喀布尔23日电　阿富汗人民在8月23日欢庆这个国家的光荣的独立节四十二周年。正在阿富汗作友好访问的中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅应邀参加了一年一度在喀布尔查曼广场举行的盛大阅兵典礼。
    在查曼广场和附近的街道上搭起了彩色的牌坊。庄严而美丽的阿富汗国旗迎风招展。从清晨起，穿着节日盛装的喀布尔市民，就聚集在查曼广场的周围。在通往这个广场的街道两旁，甚至在很多建筑物的屋顶上都站满了欢乐的人群。
    上午七时二十分，阿富汗国王穆罕默德·查希尔陛下乘车来到查曼广场。这时，会场上的人群都起来向他鼓掌欢呼。
    在礼炮鸣放以后，查希尔国王发表了庆祝独立节的演说。随后国王来到检阅台。国王接见了陈毅元帅，并且邀请他一道在检阅台上阅兵。一支由大约三百人组成的军乐队吹奏着雄壮的军乐，走到检阅台前。这时有三架直升飞机盘旋在查曼广场的上空，撒下五彩缤纷的庆祝节日的彩纸。阿富汗军事学校的学生们迈着整齐的步伐进入广场。走在他们后面的是排列成方阵的步兵部队。摩托化步兵部队、炮兵部队和坦克部队紧跟着。那些骑着威武的骏马的骑兵部队走过检阅台。喷气机群从检阅台上空掠过。它们还作了特技表演。
    在受检阅的队伍中特别引人注目的是曾经在1919年击败英国侵略者的著名战役中立下功勋的两门大炮。当这两门用花环装饰的、象征着阿富汗人民反对侵略、维护独立的斗争精神的大炮通过广场时，人们自动起立并且报以热烈的鼓掌。
    陈毅元帅和他的随行人员看到阿富汗这个友好的邻邦拥有这样一支坚强的保卫祖国、保卫和平的武装力量时，都感到兴奋。
    盛大的阅兵典礼历时一小时半。查希尔国王接见了阿富汗王国政府的领导人员以后乘车离开了检阅台。
    在阿富汗副首相萨达尔·穆罕默德·纳伊姆的陪同下，陈毅副总理乘车回到萨达拉特宫住所。沿途看到了阿富汗人民欢庆他们的节日的景象。
    阿富汗“革新报”在22日发表社论庆祝阿富汗独立节。这篇社论表达了阿富汗人民庆祝独立节时的心情。
    社论说：“独立对这个土地上的每个人是最大的骄傲。”社论又说，阿富汗一直被认为是一个为自由而战的民族。但是，如果一个民族在取得独立后不创造条件去保卫独立，它仍有可能受别人控制。独立也就成为一个空名义了。
    社论又说，为了要维护独立，在当前的时代就必须奉行明智的政策。它说：“我们的对内政策是提高人民的生活水平；对外政策也是符合人民愿望的。”在谈到阿富汗近年来执行第一个五年计划的情况时，社论说，这方面，已经取得了重大的成就。它说，“这是和正确的领导分不开的。但是，我们绝不能满足目前的状况。我们必须每天工作，而且一天比一天作得好。”
    新华社喀布尔23日电　阿富汗“希瓦德报”8月21日以“我们亲爱的客人，陈毅阁下”为题发表社论说，阿富汗人民由于生性好客，对于每一个客人，特别是对于那些来自同我们有友好关系的各国客人特别重视而且表示尊敬。
    社论说，几百年来，阿富汗人民同中国人民保持着友好的关系。我们两国人民都坚持睦邻的原则，并且相互尊重。社论说，在阿富汗人民的心中，或在他们的历史上、书本上，中国这个字眼是作为美丽和厚道记录下来的。这就是中阿两国之间几百年来存在着友好关系的原因。尽管阿富汗和中国的政治、社会和经济制度是不同的，但是阿富汗同中国的友谊和合作在日益发展。社论还说，中国在建国以来的不到十一年中，已经取得了很大的成就，它现在已经属于世界上伟大的、先进的国家之列。社论说，我们对我们友好的邻邦所取得的进步感到高兴。虽然我们同中国的关系长久以来就一直是友好的，但是现在这种关系有了巨大的发展。社论说，中国和阿富汗的国家领导人之间的相互访问大大有助于进一步发展我们两国之间的关系。艺术和文化代表团的往来也促进了相互谅解，并且彼此都留下了良好的印象。
    社论最后说，阿富汗全体人民真诚地欢迎他们的亲爱的客人，并且祝陈毅副总理在喀布尔逗留期间身体健康和感到愉快；希望他将把阿富汗人民的热烈和友好的感情带回到中国去。
    新华社喀布尔24日电　应阿富汗新闻和出版署邀请前来为庆祝阿富汗独立节举行演出的中国、苏联和印度艺术团昨天晚上在“喀布尔剧院”举行首次演出。
    阿富汗首相达乌德、副首相阿里·穆罕默德、副首相兼外交大臣纳伊姆观看了演出。
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅和他的随行人员也应邀观看了演出。
    阿富汗新闻和出版署署长穆罕默德·阿瑟夫·苏海尔在演出开始以前发表了讲话。他说，加强文化联系是发展各国之间友好关系的最好的方法之一。他还说，“根据我们的历史的和传统的中立政策，我们阿富汗人民希望了解其它国家的艺术和文化并使其它国家人民熟悉我们的文化和生活方式，这样，我们可以为世界和平和社会公道服务。”
    中国青年艺术团团长文菲在演出前也发表了讲话。他说，不久以前，中国人民看到了访问中国的阿富汗艺术团的优美的艺术表演。这一次，中国青年艺术团为庆祝阿富汗独立节到这里来给阿富汗人民举行表演。同时，将从阿富汗艺术家那里学习优美的阿富汗民族艺术。
    这次演出受到了观众们的热烈欢迎。在表演结束后，阿富汗首相达乌德和中国副总理陈毅走上舞台向中国、苏联和印度的艺术家们赠送花篮。
