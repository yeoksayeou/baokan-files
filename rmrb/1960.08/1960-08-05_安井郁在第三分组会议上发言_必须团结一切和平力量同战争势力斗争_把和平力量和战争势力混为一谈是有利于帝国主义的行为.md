Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 4th: The third group meeting of the preparatory conference for the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was held this morning. The meeting discussed "How to further promote the anti-nuclear weapons movement and the movement to aid atomic bomb victims."

	Yasui Kaoru, director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, pointed out in his speech that the task of the conference is to unite all international peaceful forces to fight against the forces of war.

	Yasui pointed out that the World Conference must draw a clear line between peaceful forces and the forces of war. Socialist countries, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America striving for national independence, and the people in capitalist countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom who demand peace and oppose war, are forces for peace; Western imperialist countries that expand armaments and prepare for war and pursue aggressive policies are the forces of war.

	Yasui pointed out that equating peaceful forces with the forces of war is an act in the peace movement that benefits imperialists.

	Japanese representative Kumakura Keian suggested that all countries with representatives attending the conference take joint international action to achieve the goals decided by the World Conference. Kumakura emphasized in his speech that it is necessary for the peace movements of all countries to learn from each other's experiences.

	Kumakura emphasized that the peace movement should wage a strong struggle against all repressive actions and divisive measures aimed at the peace movement.

	Representatives from the Soviet Union, Japan, the United States, Ceylon, Australia, India, Mexico, and Yugoslavia spoke on the issues raised by Kumakura or offered specific suggestions.

	Soviet representative Bulgakov explained that the Soviet armed forces are a powerful force in deterring aggression. The Soviet representative also said that the Soviet Union has automatically reduced its armed forces.

	One Japanese representative refuted the absurd claim that the humanitarian nature of the anti-nuclear weapons movement is "incompatible" with involvement in political issues. He emphasized that as long as Japan's movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs continues as a humanitarian movement, it should oppose aggressive military treaties such as the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

	Australian representative Chipplin expressed support for this view of the Japanese representative. He said that the worst thing on Earth is imperialism.

	Another Japanese representative suggested the early implementation of the plan to establish an international information center on the anti-nuclear weapons movement, which was decided at last year's World Conference.

    必须团结一切和平力量同战争势力斗争
    把和平力量和战争势力混为一谈是有利于帝国主义的行为
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：第六届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会预备会议的第三分组会议在今天上午举行。会议讨论了“怎样才能更加促进反对核武器运动和救济原子弹受害者的运动。”
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁在会上发言时指出，大会的任务是团结国际上的一切和平力量向战争势力进行斗争。
    安井指出，世界大会必须划清和平力量和战争势力的界限。社会主义各国、争取民族独立的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民以及美、英等资本主义国家内要求和平反对战争的人民，是和平的力量；扩军备战和执行侵略政策的西方帝国主义国家是战争势力。
    安井指出，把和平力量和战争势力混为一谈，在和平运动中是一种有利于帝国主义者的行为。
    日本代表熊仓启安建议有代表出席这次大会的所有国家采取国际共同行动来实现世界大会所决定的目标。熊仓在讲话中强调说，所有各国和平运动有必要互相学习彼此的经验。
    熊仓强调说，和平运动应当为反对针对和平运动的一切镇压行动和分裂措施进行强有力的斗争。
    苏联、日本、美国、锡兰、澳大利亚、印度、墨西哥和南斯拉夫的代表就熊仓提出的问题作了发言，或提出了具体的建议。
    苏联代表布尔加科夫说明苏联武装部队是遏制侵略的强有力的力量。苏联代表还说，苏联已经自动地裁减了它的武装部队。
    有一个日本代表驳斥了所谓反核武器运动的人道主义性质同参与政治问题的行为“是不相容”的这种荒谬说法。他强调说，只要日本反对原子弹和氢弹的运动要继续作为人道主义的运动，它就应当反对如像新日美“安全条约”之类的侵略性军事条约。
    澳大利亚代表奇普林表示支持日本代表这种观点。他说，地球上最坏的东西是帝国主义。
    另一位日本代表建议早日实现建立关于反对核武器运动的国际情报中心的计划，建立这个中心是在去年的世界大会上决定的。
