    Since the vigorous promotion of wild and miscellaneous fibers, various localities have created many indigenous degumming methods that do not require alkali or acid, based on local conditions. This not only solves the problem of the shortage of chemical raw materials such as alkali and acid, but also makes it easy for the masses to master. Below are several effective degumming methods used in various places.

    Soaking in Lime Water:
    This method has been widely adopted in various places. The specific method is: first soak the gummed fiber skin in lime water, and then rinse it with clean water. The method is simple, and the degumming effect is also very good.

    Fermentation with Qu (曲) Fungi for Degumming:
    Recently, Nantong Reeling Factory in Jiangsu Province successfully tested a method of degumming with distiller's yeast (酒曲). Distiller's yeast contains "pectinase," which, after fermentation, can decompose pectin and lignin on plants, so the degumming effect is very good. According to tests by this factory, using this method to degum cotton stalk skin can achieve a fiber yield of 37%, while the fiber yield using the alkali boiling method is only about 30%.

    Water Immersion and Small Flow Degumming:
    Water immersion is an ancient degumming method in our country. It is very simple. Put the fiber skin in water and soak it for a certain period of time to degum. Recently, Zhongjiang County in Sichuan Province has also successfully tested the "small flow degumming method" of degumming in slow-moving water, which further improves the quality of degumming.

    Steaming Method:
    Steaming the raw materials to be degummed in alkaline water or lime water, or allowing lime water vapor or alkaline water vapor to be sprayed, can degum, and the speed is relatively fast. Now, many wild fiber processing plants use these methods for degumming.

    土办法也能脱胶
    大搞野杂纤维以来，各地因地制宜，创造了许多不用碱、不用酸的脱胶土办法，不仅解决了碱、酸等化工原料不足的问题，而且广大群众掌握起来也很方便。下边是各地行之有效的几种脱胶办法。用石灰水沤：
    这个办法已被各地广泛采用。具体做法是：先把带胶的纤维皮放在石灰水中浸泡，然后再用清水冲洗，方法简单，脱胶效果也很好。曲菌脱胶法：
    最近，江苏省南通市回纺厂试验成功了用酒曲脱胶的办法。酒曲中含有“果胶酶”，经过发酵后，可以分解植物上的果胶及木质素，所以脱胶效果很好。据这个厂试验证明：用这种办法脱胶棉秆皮，出纤率可以达到37％，而用碱煮办法的出纤率只达到30％左右。水沤和小流水脱胶：
    水沤是我国的一种古老的脱胶办法，很简单，把纤维皮放到水中浸泡一定时期，就能脱胶。最近四川省中江县又试验成功了在缓慢的流水中进行脱胶的“小流水脱胶法”，进一步提高了脱胶的质量。蒸煮法：
    把要脱胶的原料放在碱水、石灰水中蒸煮，或让石灰水蒸汽、碱水蒸汽等喷射，都能脱胶，而且速度也比较快。现在，很多野生纤维加工厂，都用这些办法脱胶。
