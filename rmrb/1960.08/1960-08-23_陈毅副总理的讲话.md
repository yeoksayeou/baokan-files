Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, August 21st: When Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Marshal Chen Yi, arrived in Kabul today, he delivered a speech at the airport, the full text of which is as follows:

Your Royal Highness Prime Minister Daoud, Your Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Ali Muhammad, Your Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Naim, dear friends:

Today, my colleagues and I have come to the beautiful capital of our friendly neighbor, the Kingdom of Afghanistan. Everyone's heart is filled with passion and joy. I sincerely thank Your Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Naim and the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan for your kind invitation and thank you for your warm welcome. We regard your invitation and the welcome you have given us as an expression of the deep friendship of the Afghan people towards the Chinese people.

The mutual visits of our Premier and your Prime Minister in 1957 wrote a new and memorable chapter in the history of our two countries' friendly relations. Last year, Your Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Naim paid a friendly visit to our country, and your government also sent a delegation to participate in the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which greatly encouraged the Chinese people. Now, your government has given us this valuable opportunity to participate in the celebrations of the glorious Independence Day of the Afghan people, and we feel very honored and excited. I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, to extend our sincere respect and best wishes to the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan and the heroic Afghan people. I wish you a happy holiday, national prosperity, and the happiness of the people!

For thousands of years, the Chinese and Afghan people have lived together in harmony. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially after the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries, the traditional friendship between our two countries has continued to develop on a new basis. The friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries are a good example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. I firmly believe that through this visit, the friendship between our two countries will surely add new brilliance, thereby helping to promote the unity of the people of Asian and African countries and maintain the cause of world peace.

Qinde Bada Dosthi Afghanistani Wa Chini! (Long live Afghan-China friendship!)

    陈毅副总理的讲话
    新华社喀布尔21日电　中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅今天到达喀布尔时，在飞机场上发表讲话，全文如下：尊敬的达乌德首相殿下，尊敬的阿里·穆罕默德副首相阁下，尊敬的纳伊姆副首相殿下，亲爱的朋友们：
    今天我和我的同事们来到我们的友好邻邦阿富汗王国的美丽的首都，我们每一个人的心里都洋溢着激情和喜悦。我衷心地感谢纳伊姆副首相殿下和阿富汗王国政府的盛情邀请，感谢你们对我们的热烈欢迎。我们把你们的邀请和给予我们的欢迎看作是阿富汗人民对中国人民深厚友情的表示。
    1957年我国总理和贵国首相的互相访问，在我们两国的友好关系史上写下了新的值得纪念的一章。去年纳伊姆副首相殿下到我国进行了友好访问，贵国政府还派遣代表团参加了中华人民共和国成立十周年的庆典，这使中国人民感到很大的鼓舞。现在贵国政府给了我们这样宝贵的机会，使我们能够参加阿富汗人民光荣的独立节的庆典，我们感到非常荣幸和兴奋。我愿借这个机会，代表中国政府和人民向阿富汗王国政府和英雄的阿富汗人民，致以诚挚的敬意和良好的祝愿。祝你们节日快乐、国家繁荣、人民幸福！
    几千年来，中国人民和阿富汗人民一直和睦相处。自从中华人民共和国成立，特别是两国正式建立了外交关系以后，我们两国的传统友谊又在新的基础上获得不断的发展。我们两国的友好合作关系，是不同社会制度的国家和平共处的一个很好的榜样。我深信，通过这次的访问，我们两国的友谊一定会增添新的光彩，从而有助于促进亚非各国人民的团结和维护世界和平的事业。
    秦德巴·多斯梯·阿富甘尼斯坦·瓦秦尼（中阿友谊万岁！）
