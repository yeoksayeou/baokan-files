Hebei, Jiangsu, and Shaanxi Agricultural Middle Schools Bear Fruit
Over 40,000 Graduates Embark on the Agricultural Front

(Our report) The first group of over 37,000 students from agricultural middle schools in Hebei Province graduated this summer. With the exception of a small number who will continue their studies, the vast majority of these graduates will embark on the agricultural production front.

Under the guidance of the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, these graduates have made significant improvements in their political consciousness, cultural level, and physical fitness during their three years of study. Through socialist and communist education, and participation in social and political activities, they have established the ideology of loving the Party, loving Chairman Mao, loving the new countryside, loving labor, and loving the collective. They are determined to "be red in the countryside, be expert in the countryside, be a striving and promising youth, and be a new type of peasant." In recent years, they have studied and worked in schools, developing a set of "both civil and military" skills. Many agricultural middle schools, in conjunction with teaching and productive labor, have assisted communes in carrying out scientific research and technology promotion, conducting soil surveys and high-yield experiments. They have also partnered with nearby factories and farms to learn agricultural machinery operation and driving techniques, learn and summarize the advanced production experience of local experienced farmers, master a variety of agricultural technologies, and create significant achievements in productive labor. The sweet potatoes and radishes planted by Hanjiawa Agricultural Middle School in Ding County have achieved high yields, and Xujiazhuang Agricultural Middle School in Hengshui has created and formulated a large number of pesticides, and contracted the repair of irrigation and drainage machinery for its commune. According to incomplete statistics, more than 8,000 of these agricultural middle school graduates have learned to drive tractors, and more than 12,000 have learned to operate various irrigation and drainage machines; many have also learned machine manufacturing and repair techniques, learned soil testing and surveying, and drawn soil identification maps and water conservancy planning maps for their communes. Their cultural studies have also been excellent. According to tests conducted in Gaocheng, Hengshui, and Xinle counties, 50% of agricultural middle schools have caught up with full-time middle schools.

This group of new forces about to go to the agricultural front and the students who continue to study and improve themselves have expressed their firm determination to the Party to listen to the Party's words, continue to humbly learn book knowledge and practical knowledge, build a beautiful hometown, and contribute to the construction of modern agriculture.

(Our report) More than 6,000 students from agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province have recently completed the entire course of the third grade of agricultural junior high school, becoming the first graduates of agricultural middle schools. The majority of these graduates have been assigned work by the people's communes based on the needs of the communes, and the broad masses of commune members and cadres in various places are welcoming the new type of intellectuals and technical reserve forces cultivated by the people's communes themselves with the feeling of "a loving mother leaning on the door expecting, a child returning to his mother's joy."

These more than 6,000 graduates have completed the course of agricultural junior high school in two and a half years. These graduates have grown up with the agricultural middle schools through hard work. In the process of building schools through labor, becoming self-sufficient in production, carrying out scientific research, and improving teaching quality, they have received education and training, and have made great improvements in all aspects. In terms of ideological and moral character, many students have cultivated the communist moral character of hard work and simplicity, love for labor, and love for the collective, and are determined to struggle for the construction of a socialist and communist new countryside. Among the 45 students in the graduating class of Changle Agricultural Middle School in Haimen County, five have joined the Communist Party, fifteen have joined the Communist Youth League, and some students are actively creating conditions to strive to join the League. In terms of cultural knowledge, the academic performance of many graduating classes has caught up with the level of local full-time junior high school graduates. Among the 580 graduates in Jiangyin County, the average score of more than 85% of the students in Chinese and mathematics is above 80 points. Agricultural middle school graduates have not only learned a certain amount of cultural knowledge, but also learned agricultural production knowledge and mastered certain practical skills.

In order to strengthen agricultural production, in addition to a small number of these graduates continuing their studies, the majority are assigned to participate in agricultural production by the communes, or after short-term training, serve as commune and team accountants, and work in agricultural machinery, commune-run industries, basic scientific research, and cultural, educational, and welfare aspects.

(Our report) More than 1,000 first graduates of agricultural middle schools in Shaanxi Province have already gone to their production posts. This is a new force to strengthen the agricultural front and promote agricultural technological transformation.

This group of graduates was cultivated by the earliest agricultural middle schools established in Shaanxi Province. Over the past three years, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels and with the strong support of the broad masses, these agricultural middle schools have conscientiously implemented the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, adhered to the part-time work and part-time study system and the school-running direction of cultivating junior agricultural technical cadres with socialist and communist consciousness and a considerable junior middle school cultural level for the countryside, and given full play to its advantages. Students in this new type of school have achieved great harvests in all aspects of ideology, learning, and productive labor while studying and working. Many students have become glorious Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members through training and testing.

In terms of cultural and scientific knowledge, over the past three years, they have completed the most basic courses of ordinary middle schools, and systematically studied various technical knowledge such as crop cultivation, pest and disease control, farmland water conservancy, poultry and livestock feeding management, agricultural machinery, and accounting. In addition to greatly improving their general cultural and scientific knowledge level, the students have also mastered certain production technologies. Generally, students have mastered the cultivation and management techniques of the main local crops, and have learned to manufacture local fertilizers and various pesticides. Many students have learned to use new agricultural tools such as double-wheel double-share plows, inter-row weeding machines, and various seed drills.

Party committees at all levels, especially the commune Party committees, attach great importance to this group of graduates. Comrade Gao Guozhong, Secretary of the Huayin Commune Party Committee in Weinan County and Principal of the Liuhe Agricultural Middle School, instructed the school to organize graduates to study documents such as "Do Everything Possible to Strengthen the Agricultural Front," "On the Issue of Agricultural Mechanization," and "On the Future of Youth." Under the cordial care and teaching of the Party committee and the school, the graduates held symposiums before graduation and expressed to the Party that they would resolutely listen to the Party's words, obey the organization's assignment, and happily go to new work posts.

    河北江苏陕西农业中学桃李齐芬芳
    四万多农中毕业生走上农业战线
    本报讯　河北省各地农业中学第一批学生三万七千余人于今年暑假毕业。这批毕业生除一少部分继续升学深造外，绝大部分将走上农业生产战线。
    这批毕业生在党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针指导下，三年修业期间，政治觉悟、文化水平和体质都有了显著提高。经过社会主义和共产主义教育，和参加社会政治活动，他们树立了热爱党、热爱毛主席、热爱新农村、热爱劳动、热爱集体的思想，决心“红在农村，专在农村，作一个奋发有为的青年，作新型农民”。几年来，他们在学校里边学习、边劳动，练出了一套
  “文武双全”的本领。许多农业中学，结合教学和生产劳动，协助公社大搞科学研究和技术推广工作，进行了土壤普查和高额丰产试验；与附近工厂、农场挂钩，学习了农业机械操作和驾驶技术，学习、总结了当地老农的先进生产经验，掌握了多种农业技术，在生产劳动中创造了显著成绩。定县韩家洼农业中学种植的甘薯和红萝卜，都得到了高额丰产，衡水徐家庄农业中学创制、配制了大批农药，承包了本公社排灌机械的修理任务。据不完全统计，这批农中毕业生中，有八千多人学会了驾驶拖拉机，一万二千多人学会了操纵各种排灌机械；不少人还学会了机器制造和检修技术，学会了土壤化验、测量，并为本公社绘制了土壤鉴定图和水利规划图等。他们的文化学习成绩也很好。据藁城、衡水、新乐三个县的测验证明，有50％的农业中学赶上了全日制中学。
    这批即将走向农业战线的生力军和继续升学深造的同学，纷纷向党表示坚决听党的话，继续虚心学习书本知识和实践知识，建设美丽的家乡，为建设现代化的农业贡献力量。
