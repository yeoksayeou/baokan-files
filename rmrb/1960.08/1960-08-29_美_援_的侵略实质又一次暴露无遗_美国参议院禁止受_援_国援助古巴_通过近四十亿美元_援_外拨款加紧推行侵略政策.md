Xinhua News Agency, Washington: Just as the United States is plotting and coercing members of the Organization of American States to interfere in Cuba, the US Senate on the 24th, while discussing "foreign aid" appropriations, passed an amendment stipulating that if a country receiving US "aid" sells weapons to Cuba or provides economic assistance, the United States will immediately cease its so-called "aid" to them.

On the same day, US Acting Secretary of State Dillon, speaking before the House of Representatives about this bill, wantonly attacked Cuban Prime Minister Castro as a so-called "communist-type dictator" and blatantly stated that the United States wants to overthrow the Cuban government.

The US Senate passed a huge "Mutual Security" appropriation of more than $3.989 billion to intensify the implementation of US war and aggressive policies around the world. This appropriation is $739 million more than the "foreign aid" appropriation passed by the US Congress in the previous fiscal year; of which, direct military "aid" used to drive US lackeys to expand their armaments and prepare for war amounted to $1.8 billion, an increase of $500 million over the previous fiscal year, and "defense support" expenses, i.e., indirect military assistance, amounted to $675 million. The appropriations passed by the Senate also include the $100 million "emergency fund" that US President Eisenhower recently requested to be increased in order to deal with the struggle of the Congolese people.

This "President's Emergency Fund," specifically used to suppress national independence movements in various places, amounts to $250 million.

    美“援”的侵略实质又一次暴露无遗
    美国参议院禁止受“援”国援助古巴
    通过近四十亿美元“援”外拨款加紧推行侵略政策
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：正当美国策划和胁迫美洲国家组织成员国干涉古巴之际，美国参议院24日在讨论“援外”拨款时通过了一项修正案，规定接受美国“援助”的国家如果向古巴出售武器或者提供经济援助，美国就立即停止对它们的所谓“援助”。
      美国代理国务卿狄龙同日在众议院谈到这一法案时肆意攻击古巴总理卡斯特罗是一个所谓“共产主义类型的独裁者”，并且露骨地表示美国要推翻古巴政府。
    美国参议院通过了三十九亿八千九百多万美元的庞大的“共同安全”拨款，以在世界各地加紧推行美国的战争和侵略政策。这一拨款比上一财政年度美国国会通过的“援”外拨款增加了七亿三千九百多万美元；其中直接用来驱使美国的仆从扩军备战的军事“援助”达十八亿美元，比上一财政年度增加五亿美元，“防御支持费”即间接军事援助达六亿七千五百万美元。参议院通过的拨款中还包括美国总统艾森豪威尔最近为了对付刚果人民的斗争而要求增加的一亿美元“紧急基金”。
    这笔专门用来镇压各地民族独立运动的“总统紧急基金”达二亿五千万美元。
