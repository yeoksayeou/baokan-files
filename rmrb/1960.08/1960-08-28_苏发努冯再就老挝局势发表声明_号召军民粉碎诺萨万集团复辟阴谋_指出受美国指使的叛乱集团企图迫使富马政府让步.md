Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 26th: The Lao Fighting Forces Radio broadcast yesterday a statement by Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, regarding the recent situation in Laos, according to a report from the Vietnam News Agency.

The statement exposed the plot of the Phoumi Nosavan group to force the Phouma government to make concessions, in order to advance on Vientiane, dissolve and eliminate the coup committee, and regain power.

In the statement, Prince Souphanouvong reiterated the Lao Patriotic Front's view that the coup launched by the 2nd Paratroop Battalion under the command of Captain Kong Le on August 9 was a victory for the Lao people's struggle for national liberation and against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

In this statement, Prince Souphanouvong condemned the U.S. imperialists for helping the rebellious Phoumi Nosavan group to undermine the achievements of the Lao people's struggle, undermine Laos' policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, oppose the legally constituted Souvanna Phouma government, and conspire to eliminate the forces of the coup committee and the Lao people's movement for national liberation and against U.S. imperialism.

Prince Souphanouvong condemned the Phoumi Nosavan group for colluding with the reactionary authorities of Thailand and South Vietnam, deceiving and coercing officers and troops still under their control to attack the government, as well as the troops and citizens of Vientiane, and for imposing an economic blockade on the capital, creating confusion and chaos among the people.

The statement said: "What is more serious is that during the recent talks between Prince Souvanna Phouma and Phoumi Nosavan, the Nosavan group resorted to tricks, pretending to agree to halt their troops' advance on Vientiane, in order to force the government of Prince Souvanna Phouma, who hoped to avoid bloodshed, to make many concessions harmful to the country, such as reorganizing the government to put American running dogs like Phoumi Nosavan in power, thereby facilitating the entry of their troops into Vientiane; dissolving and eliminating the coup committee; taking back the weapons distributed to the people for the defense of Vientiane, etc."

Prince Souphanouvong said, "This conspiracy is serious and harmful to our motherland and people. If this conspiracy succeeds, the achievements of the coup, as well as the guidelines and policies announced by the coup committee and the government of Prince Souvanna Phouma, will be undermined."

Prince Souphanouvong also exposed the Phoumi Nosavan group's attempt to use the talks with Prime Minister Phouma to deceive the people and carry out their traitorous conspiracy.

In his statement, he called upon:

	(1) The government of Prince Souvanna Phouma should never make concessions to the rebellious Nosavan group. It should demand that the Nosavan group cease all military operations against Vientiane and compel them to return to Vientiane immediately to resolve the issues.

Our people are firmly opposed to the comeback of the reactionary running dogs of U.S. imperialism to continue to carry out their traitorous policies and drag out the protracted civil war.

	(2) The people and troops of Vientiane should continue to be vigilant, firmly unite their ranks, hold their weapons tightly, and be ready to crush all attacks by the Nosavan group in order to maintain a genuine policy of peace and neutrality, defend the government of Prince Souvanna Phouma, and protect the lives and property of the people and our beloved capital, Vientiane.

The officers and soldiers of the Second Paratroop Battalion, who overthrew the reactionary and traitorous Phongsavanh-Phoumi Nosavan government, thereby making a great contribution to the cause of national liberation, should be vigilant, ready to crush all attacks by the Nosavan group, and resolutely join the people in safeguarding the policy of peace and neutrality achieved through bloodshed and sacrifice.

	(3) The officers and soldiers who are still being deceived and oppressed by the Nosavan group should cease all actions and attacks, resolutely refuse to obey the orders of the Nosavan group, unite and support the officers and soldiers now stationed in Vientiane, in order to crush the traitorous conspiracy of the Nosavan group.

He finally appealed: Dear compatriots, the just struggle of the Lao people is not isolated. The coup launched by the people and troops of Vientiane has received the warm support of the people throughout the country. Friends of peace all over the world have also expressed their full support for our struggle.

Compatriots, officers and soldiers of the army, let us advance bravely!

Final victory will surely belong to us.

    苏发努冯再就老挝局势发表声明
    号召军民粉碎诺萨万集团复辟阴谋
    指出受美国指使的叛乱集团企图迫使富马政府让步
    新华社河内26日电　据越南通讯社报道，寮国战斗部队电台昨天广播了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王就最近老挝局势发表的一项声明。
    声明揭露了富米·诺萨万集团企图迫使富马政府作出让步，以便进军万象，解散并消灭政变委员会，并重新夺取政权的阴谋。
    苏发努冯亲王在声明中重申老挝爱国战线党的这种看法：在贡勒大尉统率下的伞兵第二营8月9日发动的政变是老挝人民争取民族解放、反对美帝国主义及其仆从的斗争的胜利。
    苏发努冯亲王在这项声明里谴责美帝国主义者帮助叛乱的富米·诺萨万集团破坏老挝人民斗争的成果，破坏老挝和平、中立和民族和睦的政策，反对合法组成的梭发那·富马政府，阴谋消灭政变委员会的力量和老挝人民争取民族解放、反对美帝国主义的运动。
    苏发努冯亲王谴责了富米·诺萨万集团同泰国和越南南部的反动当局勾结起来，欺骗并强迫仍然在他们控制下的军官和军队进攻政府以及万象的军队和公民，并对首都实行经济封锁，在人民中间制造迷惑和混乱的阴谋活动。
    声明说：“更为严重的是，在梭发那·富马亲王和富米·诺萨万最近举行会谈的时候，诺萨万集团行使诡计，假装同意使他们的军队停止向万象推进，以迫使希望避免流血的梭发那·富马亲王的政府作出对这个国家有害的很多让步，如改组政府使像富米·诺萨万这样的美国走狗当权，从而为他们的军队进驻万象提供方便；解散并消灭政变委员会；收回为了保卫万象而散发给人民的武器等。”
    苏发努冯亲王说，“这种阴谋对我们的祖国和人民是严重而且有害的。如果这种阴谋得逞，政变的成果以及政变委员会和梭发那·富马亲王政府所宣布的方针政策将被破坏。”
    苏发努冯亲王还揭露了富米·诺萨万集团企图利用同富马首相举行会谈来欺骗人民和进行他们的叛国阴谋。
    他在声明里呼吁：
      （一）梭发那·富马亲王政府决不应该对叛乱的诺萨万集团让步。它应该要求诺萨万集团停止进攻万象的一切军事行动，并且强迫他们立即返回万象以解决问题。
    我们的人民坚决反对美帝国主义的反动走狗卷土重来以继续执行他们的卖国政策，把旷日持久的内战拖下去。
      （二）万象人民和军队应该继续保持警惕，牢牢地团结他们的队伍，紧握着他们的武器，随时粉碎诺萨万集团的一切进攻，以便维护真正的和平和中立政策，保卫梭发那·富马亲王的政府，保卫人民的生命财产和我们亲爱的首都万象。
    推翻了反动的和叛国的松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万政府从而对民族解放事业作出了巨大贡献的第二伞兵营的军官和士兵们，应该提高警惕，随时准备粉碎诺萨万集团的一切进攻，并且坚决同人民一起来维护通过流血牺牲而取得的和平和中立的方针。
      （三）仍然受诺萨万集团欺骗和压迫的军官和士兵们，停止一切行动和进攻，坚决拒绝服从诺萨万集团的命令，联合并支持现在驻在万象的军官和士兵，以粉碎诺萨万集团的卖国阴谋。
    他最后呼吁说：亲爱的同胞们，老挝人民的正义斗争不是孤立的。万象的人民和军队举行的政变取得了全国各地人民的热烈支持。全世界的和平朋友也表示充分支持我们的斗争。
    全体同胞们，军队的军官和士兵们，让我们英勇地前进！
    最后胜利将一定属于我们。
