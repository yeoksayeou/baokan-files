    Qinghai Petroleum Administration Initially Achieves the Scale of a Conglomerate
    Self-Reliantly Establishes Various Industries Serving the Petroleum Industry, with 80% of Building Materials Self-Supplied

    (Our newspaper, Xining, 1st dispatch) The Qinghai Provincial Petroleum Administration has broken free from singular operations and built a comprehensive conglomerate, primarily focused on the petroleum industry, on what was once a barren Gobi desert.

    The Qinghai Petroleum Administration is located in the Gobi Desert, far from the interior, with long transportation lines. Whether it be production materials or living materials, most of them have to be supplied from other places. With the rapid development of the petroleum industry, the need for materials will only increase. In response to this situation, the Qinghai Petroleum Administration Party Committee mobilized all employees to vigorously engage in diversified operations and comprehensive utilization. They tried every means to tap potential, diligently learned technology, built houses themselves, and manufactured machines themselves. In just over a year, they have initially built a comprehensive conglomerate primarily focused on the petroleum industry in the Gobi Desert.

    Now, the Qinghai Petroleum Administration not only possesses all the trades of the petroleum industry, from ground surveys, drilling, oil extraction, and the refining, storage, and transportation of crude oil, but has also initially established industrial systems such as machinery, infrastructure construction, transportation, hydropower, and chemical industries serving the petroleum industry. Several large and small machine repair factories in the bureau have all developed in the direction of both repair and manufacturing. Among them, the bureau's General Machinery Factory has been able to manufacture simple equipment for drilling, oil extraction, refining, and some machinery aspects, as well as more than 370 kinds of products such as various internal combustion engine parts, and has manufactured more than 200 sets of various simple machine tools and equipment, arming various affiliated factories.

    While solving the manufacturing of machinery and equipment, the Qinghai Petroleum Administration, adhering to the spirit of building factories wherever there are materials, has successively established hundreds of factories producing raw materials and chemical products such as refractory materials, cement, lime, barite powder, blue bricks, ceramics, reed boards, oxygen, caustic soda, and hydrochloric acid. After launching the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, the work efficiency of these factories has increased several times to dozens of times, producing a large number of high-quality, low-cost products. For example, the large amount of barite powder consumed every year was transported from thousands of kilometers away. Since local materials were used and produced locally, not only was production needs met, but also the cost was reduced by one-half. A large number of building materials they produced themselves have been able to meet 80% of the bureau's infrastructure construction needs. In just over a year, more than 100,000 square meters of factory buildings, offices, and dormitories have been built using these materials.

### 青海石油管理局初具联合企业规模  自力更生建立为石油工业服务的各种工业，建筑材料80％自给

    青海石油管理局初具联合企业规模
    自力更生建立为石油工业服务的各种工业，建筑材料80％自给
    本报西宁1日电　青海省石油管理局大破单一经营，在原是万里不毛的戈壁滩上，建起了一个以石油工业为主的综合性联合企业。
    青海石油管理局地处戈壁滩，距内地较远，交通线长，不论是生产资料或生活资料，大都要从外地供应，随着石油工业的飞跃发展，对物资的需要会越来越多，针对这种情况，中共青海石油管理局党委发动全体职工大搞多种经营和综合利用。他们千方百计地挖掘潜力，努力学技术，自己造房子，自己造机器，仅仅在一年多的时间内，就在戈壁滩上初步建起了一个以石油工业为主的综合性的联合企业。
    现在，青海石油管理局不仅拥有从地面调查、钻探、采油以及原油的炼、储、运等石油工业的全部工种，而且初步建立了为石油工业服务的机械、基建、运输、水电、化工等工业体系。全局的几个大小机修厂，都已向修配、制造并举的方向发展。其中局属机械总厂已能制造钻井、采油、炼油和部分机械等方面的简易设备，以及各种内燃机配件等三百七十多种产品，并制造了各种简易机床和设备二百多台，武装了各个附属工厂。
    在解决机具和设备制造的同时，青海石油管理局还本着哪里有材料就在哪里建厂的精神，先后建立了耐火材料、水泥、石灰、重晶石粉、青砖、陶瓷、芦苇板、氧气、烧碱、盐酸等上百个生产原材料和化学产品的工厂。在开展技术革新和技术革命的群众运动以后，这些工厂的工效又先后提高了数倍至数十倍，生产出大批质量好、成本低的产品。如过去每年大量消耗的重晶石粉都是由几千公里以外运来，自从就地取材、就地生产以后，不仅满足了生产需要，而且使成本降低了二分之一。他们自己生产出来的大批建筑材料，已能满足全局基建需要的80％。在一年多的时间内，利用这些材料已修建了十几万平方米的厂房、办公室和宿舍。
