    朝鲜工人制成山区小型拖拉机
    新华社平壤7日电　这里的报纸今天报道，朝鲜江界纺织机械工厂的工人，试制成功一种特别适用于山区的小型拖拉机——“丰年六十号”。这是这个工厂的工人们用四个星期的时间突击制成的，作为向“八·一五”朝鲜解放十五周年的献礼。
    这种小型拖拉机有五点五匹马力，性能很好，一天能耕地一町步（约合十五市亩），它的特点是无论多么小的小块地也能耕。用它进行运输作业，带着拖车，最大时速是十五公里，运输能力是七百公斤。另外，还可以用它抽水、脱谷、扇风。
    朝鲜是山地多的国家。这种小型拖拉机的制成，对实现朝鲜的农业机械化有重大意义。据报道，从明年开始，朝鲜将大量生产这种拖拉机。
