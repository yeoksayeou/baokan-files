Nanjing, August 5th (report from this newspaper) Nanjing's work in supporting coal mines in technological transformation has developed from factory-mine pairings to institute-mine, commune-mine, store-mine, and school-mine pairings, with all industries going up the mountains and down the wells to provide on-the-spot support, forming a mass movement that comprehensively and systematically supports mine technological transformation both inside and outside the mines, above and below ground. With the strong support of all sectors, the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the city's five coal mines has increased from 37% in the first quarter to 59% at present. Coal production in July increased by 12.2% compared to June, and nearly doubled compared to the same period last year, changing the previous situation of production stoppages or reductions during the rainy season.

Nanjing's small coal mines were all built using indigenous methods during the Great Leap Forward, with a relatively weak technical foundation. In the past, many factories in Nanjing had supported the mines with necessary equipment, initially improving their production capacity. Since May of this year, in order to provide more comprehensive support, the Municipal Party Committee organized twenty machinery and instrument factories, such as the Chenguang Machine Factory and the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory, to establish long-term paired cooperation relationships with five coal mines, including Qinglongshan, Lingshan, Hushan, Guantang, and Longtan. They adopted methods of visiting the mines, discussing issues together, providing technical support on-site, and delivering goods to the mines, supporting the mines' technological transformation in six aspects: (1) Helping the mines maintain and repair existing equipment, replace parts, and prepare accessories to ensure normal operation of the equipment; (2) Starting with arming production tools and equipment, helping to establish machine repair workshops so that the mines themselves can undertake medium and small repairs of equipment; (3) Providing technical support; (4) Organizing the complete set of coal mining equipment to balance the capacity of excavation, transportation, and hoisting equipment, so as to maximize the capacity of existing equipment; (5) Bringing new achievements in technological revolution and technological innovation to the coal mines; (6) Helping the coal mines to carry out comprehensive technological transformation planning and mine area layout. Through such support, a good technical foundation has been established for the development of coal mines.

Since supporting coal mines in technological transformation concerns all aspects, all industries in Nanjing, in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, have been paired with coal mines and provide support according to their own capabilities. The person in charge of the Nanjing Electric Power Bureau went deep into the front line and established a coal mine power supply engineering command center, concentrating forces to help the coal mines build more than 30 kilometers of 35,000-volt lines and install ten transformer equipment sets totaling 1,540 kilovolt-amperes in just two months. Now high-voltage lines have been sent to various mining areas, greatly changing the production landscape of coal mines. The transportation department moved ten tasks to the site, including shift handover, refueling, maintenance, kitchen, vehicle inspection, dispatch, statistics, study, propaganda and mobilization, and leading cadres' meetings and offices. In May and June, they rushed to transport more than 43,000 tons of coal and more than 10,000 tons of infrastructure materials, ensuring that coal was transported as soon as it was extracted from the mine and construction materials were delivered promptly. The infrastructure department rushed to install equipment such as winches and air compressors for various coal mines in two months, basically ensuring that coal mine equipment was installed as soon as it arrived at the mine, and supplied a large number of building materials such as bricks, tiles, sand, and stone. The Municipal Health Bureau organized five hospitals to pair up with coal mines. Each hospital not only sent doctors and nurses to the mines for on-site medical treatment, but also organized physical examination teams to conduct roving inspections to ensure the health of workers. The labor department helped coal mines improve labor organization, proposed labor protection measures, solved the problems of necessary medicines and beverages in summer, and is currently investigating the return of old coal miners in the city. The commercial department adopted methods such as delivering goods to the door, expanding coal mine supply points, and improving supply standards, and worked with various communes to study and determine fixed supply points for vegetables, in order to timely improve the lives of employees in the mining area.

In order to strengthen the unified leadership of all industries in supporting mine work, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, a line of professional leadership was established from the city to the mines. The city established a leading group dedicated to supporting the mines and set up the command post in the mines to organize support on the spot. Each factory and paired mine also jointly formed a leading group, stationed in the mine to solve problems in collaboration on the spot. At the same time, leading cadres of the Municipal Party Committee often led heads of various departments to go up the mountains and down the wells to inspect work, discover problems, and immediately designate relevant departments to solve them within a time limit.

Changsha, August 5th (report from this newspaper) All industries in Hunan Province support the technological transformation of mines, striving to develop the production of coal, iron ore and other mining industries at high speed, in order to ensure the sustained leap forward in steel production.

Under the leadership of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, all sectors of the province regard supporting the technological transformation of mines as their glorious task. The staff and workers of the mechanical system tried every possible means to rush to produce equipment for the mines. This year, mechanical plants across the province have produced 383 winches, 282 crushers, 83 ball mills, and more than 190 tons of mineral washing and ore dressing equipment for various coal and iron mines. In addition, a large number of motors, electrical equipment, small mine cars, pneumatic picks, pneumatic shovels and ventilation equipment, blasting materials and drainage equipment for mines have also been produced. When the Changsha Xinzhong Machinery Factory was manufacturing a batch of steam pumps for mines, the special project materials were not available for a while, so they used materials from other products to produce them first. When the processing capacity was insufficient, they concentrated their efforts to manufacture this batch of products first. As a result, the manufacturing task of 50 steam pumps was completed ahead of schedule, and they were delivered to mines in various places in a timely manner. Mechanical factories across the province also organized more than 1,000 technicians and workers to go up the mountains and down the wells to help mines repair and install equipment.

Many factories in various places have also adopted the method of large factories contracting large mines and small factories contracting small mines, providing all-inclusive support from equipment installation and maintenance to technical support, whatever is lacking. After Hengyang Prospecting Machinery Factory took the initiative to pair up with Hengshan County Bajingtian Iron Mine and Qidong County Qiyi Coal Mine, it has trained more than 40 technical personnel for these two mines this year. Hunan Agricultural Machinery Factory, Changsha Xieyu Weaving Factory, Changsha Meat United Processing Factory and other units have extracted their unused small-scale power equipment to support the needs of coal and iron mines near Changsha City.

Commercial departments in various places have also played the role of "logistics department", going deep into iron and coal mines to organize the supply of materials such as spare parts for mine technological transformation. When the Dashiqiao Iron Mine in Shaodong County vigorously carried out blasting innovation, it needed a lot of materials such as detonators and fuses, and the staff of the county commercial department promptly tried to supply these materials. In May and June of this year, the county's commercial departments also organized and supplied a large number of lead wires, lead nails, tapes, inner and outer tires for handcarts, light bulbs and other materials for the mines. In addition, they also comprehensively used local steel and iron to produce more than 120,000 mining tools such as picks and sledgehammers for the mines on the spot. The commercial and banking departments of Changsha City, led by the Deputy Director of the Changsha Branch of the People's Bank of China, organized a working group to go to the Tiao Ma, Tiandingguan, and Lianhua iron and coal mines in Changsha City to assist in solving problems such as material supply and funds. Changsha Industrial Equipment Company has set up resident mine special commissioners in units such as Tiaoma Coal Mine to promptly understand the needs of the mines and organize equipment supply. The province's infrastructure and transportation departments have also actively supported mine technological transformation in terms of material supply and material transportation.

    南京市各方面全力支援矿山
    湖南各地为矿山赶制设备培养技术力量组织物资供应
    本报南京5日电　南京市支援煤矿进行技术改造的工作已由厂矿挂钩发展到院矿、社矿、店矿、校矿挂钩，各行各业上山下井就地支援，形成了一个矿内矿外、山上山下全面系统地支援矿山技术改造的群众运动。全市五个煤矿在各行各业大力支援下，机械化半机械化程度从第一季度的37％提高到目前的59％，7月份煤炭产量比6月份增加12.2％，比去年同期增加近一倍，改变了以往雨季停产或减产的局面。
    南京市的小型煤矿都是在大跃进中用土法建成的，技术基础较差。过去南京市的许多工厂，曾经支援了许多必要的设备，初步提高了煤矿的生产能力。今年5月份以来，为了更全面地进行支援，市委组织了晨光机器厂、南京机床厂等二十家机械、仪表厂与青龙山、灵山、湖山、官塘、龙潭等五个煤矿，建立了长期挂钩协作关系，采取登门拜访，共同商量，技术上山，送货到矿的办法，从六个方面支援了煤矿技术改造：（1）帮助煤矿对现有设备进行维护检修，拆换零件，准备配件，保证设备正常运转；（2）从武装生产工具、设备着手，帮助建立机修车间，使煤矿本身能够担负设备的中小修；（3）支援技术力量；（4）组织煤矿设备的配套成龙，使掘进、运输、提升设备能力平衡，以最大限度地发挥现有设备的能力。（5）把技术革命和技术革新的新成果带到煤矿；（6）帮助煤矿进行全面技术改造的规划和矿区的布置。通过这样的支援，为煤矿的发展建立了良好的技术基础。
    由于支援煤矿进行技术改造，关系到各个方面，南京市各行各业根据市委的指示，都与煤矿挂上了钩，根据自己的力量加以支援。南京电业局负责人深入第一线，建立煤矿用电工程指挥所，集中兵力，在短短的两个月中，就帮助煤矿建立了三万五千伏线路三十余公里，装设变压设备十台、一千五百四十千伏安。现在高压线均已送到各个矿区，大大改变了煤矿的生产面貌。交通运输部门把交接班、加油、保养修理、伙房、车辆检查、调度工作、统计工作、学习、宣传鼓动、领导干部开会办公等十项工作都搬到现场，在5、6两月突击运出了四万三千余吨煤炭，运进了一万多吨基建材料，做到了煤出井就运，建井材料包运。基建部门两个月中为各煤矿突击安装了卷扬机、压风机等设备，基本上做到煤矿设备到矿就装，并供应了大量的砖瓦砂石等建筑材料。市卫生局组织了五个医院和煤矿挂钩，各医院不仅派出了医生、护士去矿就地医疗，并且组织了体格检查队巡回检查，以保证工人身体的健康。劳动部门帮助煤矿改进了劳动组织，提出了劳动保护办法，解决了夏季必需的药品和饮料，并正在着手调查全市老煤矿工人的归队问题。商业部门采取了送货上门，扩大煤矿供应点，改善供应标准等办法，并且和各公社一同研究确定蔬菜固定供应点，及时地改善了矿区职工生活。
    为了加强各行各业支援矿山工作的统一领导，在市委领导下，从市到矿建立了一条线的专业领导，市里成立了专管支援矿山的领导小组，而且将指挥部设在矿山，到现场组织支援。各厂和挂钩的矿也共同组成领导小组，驻在矿山就地解决协作中的问题。同时市委的领导干部经常带领各部门负责人上山下井，检查工作，发现问题，立即指定有关部门，限期解决。
    本报长沙5日电　湖南各行各业支援矿山进行技术改造，力争高速度发展煤炭、铁矿等采掘工业生产，以保证钢铁工业生产持续跃进。
    在中共湖南省委的领导下，全省各行各业都把支援矿山的技术改造当作自己的光荣任务。机械系统的职工们，千方百计为矿山赶制设备。今年来，全省各机械厂已为各煤矿和铁矿生产卷扬机三百八十三台，破碎机二百八十二台，球磨机八十三台，洗矿选矿设备一百九十多吨。此外，还生产了大批矿山用的电机、电器设备、小矿车、风镐、风铲和通风设备、爆破器材和排水等设备。长沙新中机械厂在制造一批矿山用的蒸汽泵时，专案材料一时未到，他们就先用其它产品的材料生产。加工力量不足，他们就集中力量优先制造这批产品。因而提前完成了五十台蒸汽泵的制造任务，及时送到各地矿山。全省各机械工厂还组织一千多名技术工人上山下井，帮助矿山检修和安装设备。
    各地许多工厂还采取大厂包大矿、小厂包小矿的方式，从设备装置、维修到技术力量，缺什么、补什么，一包到底。衡阳探矿机械厂主动与衡山县八井田铁矿、祁东县七一煤矿挂钩以后，今年已为这两个矿培养了技术人才共四十多人。湖南农业机械厂、长沙协裕织布厂、长沙肉类联合加工厂等单位，抽出自己不用的小型动力设备，支援了长沙市附近的煤矿和铁矿的需要。
    各地商业部门也发挥“后勤部”的作用，深入铁矿和煤矿，组织供应矿山技术改造的配件等物资。邵东县大石桥铁矿在大闹爆破革新时，需要许多雷管、引线等物资，县商业部门的职工就及时地设法供应了这些物资。这个县商业部门在今年5、6两个月中，还为矿山组织供应了大批铅丝、铅钉、胶带、人力车内外轮胎、电灯泡等物资。此外，他们还综合利用土钢土铁，就地生产矿山用的大批洋镐、鎯头等采掘工具达十二万多件，供应给矿山。长沙市商业、银行等部门，由人民银行长沙市分行副行长领队，组织工作组下到长沙市的跳马、天顶关、莲花等铁矿和煤矿，协助解决物资供应和资金等问题。长沙市工业器材公司在跳马煤矿等单位设立了驻矿特派员，及时了解矿山的需要，组织器材供应。全省基建和交通运输部门，也从物资供应和物资运输等方面积极支援矿山技术改造。
