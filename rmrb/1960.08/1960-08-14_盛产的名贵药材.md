    Famous Wenshan Dangshen
    Wenshan Dangshen, produced in the Longnan mountainous area of Wen County, is famous throughout the country for its large, fat stalks, sweet taste without residue, and unique aroma.
    Wenshan Dangshen is divided into cultivated and wild varieties. The head of the cultivated Dangshen is small, resembling a "snake's head," while the wild Dangshen is commonly known as "lion's head." Wenshan Dangshen is a perennial vine-like herb. Seedlings emerge from the rootstocks in March and April each year, with lush branches and leaves that twine along the ground or other plant stems. The entire plant has a fragrant aroma. It blooms in June and July with purple stripes, and the fruit is flat and round.
    Wenshan Dangshen mainly treats deficiency of blood, clears the lungs and benefits qi, nourishes the spleen, replenishes blood and strengthens the stomach, and is a good nourishing medicine. Wen County produces more than 110,000 jin of Dangshen annually.
    Minxian Danggui
    Minxian Danggui has been famous at home and abroad since ancient times.
    Danggui is abundant in the Wushan, Xili, Wudu, and Wen counties of the Longnan mountainous area, but Minxian Danggui has the highest yield, best quality, and most uniform size. Every autumn in September, when Danggui blooms, the mountains and fields are covered in white blossoms with a refreshing fragrance. Danggui is a perennial herb, and Minxian, with its ample rainfall and high, cold, and damp terrain, is ideal for growing Danggui.
    The Longnan mountainous area has a history of planting Danggui for about two thousand years, with high cultivation and preparation techniques. The province has a planting area of about 50,000 mu, and Minxian alone purchases more than 11.1 million jin annually.
    Quanshui Rhubarb
    Quanshui Rhubarb is abundant in the Taoping area of Xili County in the Longnan mountainous area, with the highest quality produced in Taoping and Yidi, with large and plump roots and significant medicinal effects. The rhubarb produced in the Taoping area was previously processed and transported from Quanshui Town, hence the name Quanshui Rhubarb.
    After liberation, thanks to the Party's attention, the Taoping and other people's communes made comprehensive arrangements to actively expand planting areas and develop rhubarb production. Now, the annual output of rhubarb in the Taoping People's Commune alone has reached more than 400,000 jin, and the yield per unit area has increased by 70%.

    盛产的名贵药材
    文县党参
    陇南山区文县所产的党参，以条秆肥大、味甜无渣、具有特异香气驰名全国。
    文党有家种与野生之分，家党头小似“蛇头”，野党俗称“狮子头”。文党为多年蔓生草本植物，每年3、4月间从宿根芦头生出幼苗，枝叶茂盛，沿地面或其它植物茎秆缠绕生长，全身具有芳香气味，6、7月间开花，带有紫色条纹，果实扁圆。
    文党参主治补虚血、清肺益气、培脾，补血健胃，为滋补性良药。文县党参年产十一万多斤。
    岷县当归
    岷县当归自古驰名中外。
    在陇南山区的武山、西礼、武都、文县等地，都盛产当归，但是尤以岷县当归产量多，质量好，个头整齐。每年良秋9月，当归开花时，满山遍野，一片雪白，清香扑鼻。当归为多年生草本植物，岷县雨量充足，地势高寒阴湿，最适宜种植当归。
    陇南山区种植当归约有两千年左右的历史，栽培技术和泡制技术都很高。全省种植面积五万亩左右，只岷县一地每年的收购量即一千一百多万斤。
    铨水大黄
    铨水大黄盛产于陇南山区的西礼县洮坪一带，其中以洮坪、义堤所产质量最为优良，根大而肥，医疗功效显著。洮坪一带所产的大黄，以往因汇集于铨水镇加工外运，故以铨水大黄出名。
    解放后，由于党的重视，洮坪等人民公社全面安排，积极扩大种植地区，发展大黄生产。现在只洮坪人民公社的大黄年产量就达到四十多万斤，单位面积产量提高70％。
