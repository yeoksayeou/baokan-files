Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 2nd: The National Amateur Education Tianjin Conference was held from the 20th to the 29th. The conference was jointly convened by the Ministry of Education and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

This was a field conference on amateur education, as well as a working conference. The main content of the conference was to study the new tasks of literacy and amateur education and the work arrangements for the second half of the year; to extensively exchange experiences in carrying out teaching reforms in industrial and agricultural amateur education and cadre cultural education.

Information from factories, mines, and rural areas across the country vividly shows that under the powerful impetus of the continuous great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and the nationwide movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, amateur education in factories, mines, enterprises, and the vast countryside has also shown a great situation of continuous leap forward. Since last autumn and winter, more than 100 million young and middle-aged farmers in rural areas have persisted in amateur learning. The number of employees in factories and mines participating in amateur learning has increased by 50% compared to the end of last year. From January to April this year, more than 30 million illiterate people among young and middle-aged workers and farmers have been made literate, which is 23% more than the number of illiterate people made literate throughout last year. With the large-scale elimination of illiteracy, various types of amateur schools from primary to advanced levels have greatly developed in various regions. Judging only from the number of employees entering amateur colleges and universities, it has increased by more than one and a half times compared to the end of last year. Some factories and mines in some regions have also established full-time colleges and universities. In vigorously running amateur education, various regions have further implemented the principles of "combining with production, unified arrangements, teaching students according to their aptitude, and flexibility and diversity," making amateur education closely integrated with production, properly arranged, and many new developments in the form of schooling. In particular, the teaching reform experiments carried out in various regions have created and explored some valuable experiences, which have played a positive role in further implementing the Party's education policy and cultivating construction talents in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way.

The conference believes that the great achievements of amateur education in the first half of the year have laid a good foundation for continued leap forward in the second half of the year. The task of amateur education in the second half of the year should be to continue to implement the policy of "consolidating, persisting, improving quality, and continuing development," and to launch a larger-scale literacy movement, mass learning movement, and mass teaching reform upsurge after autumn, and strive to complete this year's plan with guaranteed quality and quantity.

The conference pointed out that literacy work and amateur primary education in the second half of the year must be grasped firmly and meticulously. Phonetic literacy is an important method for accelerating the elimination of illiteracy and popularizing amateur primary education, and must be actively promoted. With the progress of literacy work, the proportion of illiterate people among young and middle-aged people is gradually decreasing, the difficulties in learning are gradually increasing, and the remaining illiterate people are more scattered. It is still quite difficult to complete the task of literacy. However, it must also be seen that there are more and more favorable factors for literacy work. The vast number of literate people surround the illiterate people, the problem of teachers is relatively easy to solve, and the teaching experience is richer than in the past. The conference called on all regions, business systems, and grassroots units to vigorously grasp the work of investigating the number of illiterate people. The investigation is to have a clear understanding, so as to actively and realistically carry out literacy work.

The conference believes that literacy and amateur primary education should be closely linked and accomplished in one go. In the future, a group of illiterate people should be made literate and then promoted to schools. The conference calls for "vigorously running amateur professional education in order to quickly solve the technical strength needed for production, requiring amateur education to be from primary to advanced, from incomplete to complete, and gradually form a network system."

The conference pointed out that teaching reform is a continuous revolution in education. Although industrial and agricultural amateur education has undergone some reforms, it is still influenced by bourgeois educational thought. In order to adapt to the requirements of the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the great technical revolution, teaching reforms must be further carried out in terms of teaching content, teaching methods to suit the characteristics of adults, etc. The conference believes that teaching reform must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought, reflect the spirit of the general line of socialist construction, so as to achieve the purpose of cultivating construction talents in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, and accelerate the intellectualization of workers and peasants; it must not only meet the needs of the current socialist revolution and socialist construction, but also have a long-term goal. Our long-term goal is to cultivate workers and peasants into laborers who have both a high degree of communist consciousness and modern cultural and scientific knowledge, and who can engage in both physical and mental labor. According to this requirement, amateur education should follow the principle of "combining with production and teaching students in accordance with their aptitude," so that workers and peasants can quickly specialize in their own professions and play a role in production posts, which is the main aspect at present. On the other hand, it is also necessary to target the specific conditions of workers and peasants, so that they gradually become "multi-skilled" and master the deep and broad knowledge needed to advance to cutting-edge science. The conference pointed out that amateur education work and teaching reform must follow the mass line, mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, boldly create, and let a hundred flowers bloom.

Lin Feng, Director of the State Council's Amateur Education Committee, made an important speech at the conference. He pointed out that industrial and agricultural amateur education is facing a great situation of great development, great improvement, persistence, and continuous revolution. This situation has been formed under the leadership of the Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, and through the close combination and mutual promotion of ideological revolution, technical revolution, and cultural revolution. In such a situation of continuous leap forward, he requested that amateur education work be done more solidly and powerfully, without complacency, without slackening, and resolutely eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in the country in basically two or three years, and closely following the popularization of amateur primary education, consolidating and improving, continuing to develop amateur secondary education and higher education, actively carrying out teaching reforms and strengthening leadership. He also pointed out that amateur education must persist regularly and pay attention to the combination of work and rest.

During the conference, Zhang Chengxian, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, reported on the situation of industrial and agricultural amateur education in Hebei Province. Dong Chuncai, Vice Minister of Education, Zhang Xiuzhu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Cheng Zhaoxuan, representative of the Ministry of Agriculture, spoke on the current work of industrial and agricultural amateur education.

    全国业余教育天津会议提出下半年任务保
    质保量完成业余教育计划
    狠抓细抓扫盲和群众学习运动，积极进行教学改革
    据新华社天津2日电　全国业余教育天津会议在20日到29日举行，会议由教育部、中华全国总工会联合召开。
    这是一次业余教育的现场会议，也是一次工作会议。会议的主要内容是研究当前扫盲和业余教育的新任务以及下半年的工作安排；广泛地交流工农业余教育和干部文化教育开展教学改革工作的经验。
    来自全国厂矿、农村的情况，生动地表明了在工农业生产持续大跃进，和全民性的技术革新、技术革命运动的有力带动下，全国厂矿企业和广大农村的业余教育也出现了持续跃进的大好形势。从去年秋冬以来，农村中有一亿以上的青壮年农民坚持了业余学习。厂矿企业职工参加业余学习的人数比去年底增加了50％。今年1至4月，在青壮年职工和农民中已经扫除文盲三千多万人，比去年全年扫除的文盲数还多23％。随着文盲的大量扫除，各地从初级到高级的各类业余学校有了很大发展。仅从进入业余大专学校学习的职工人数来看，就比去年底增长了一倍半以上。有些地区的厂矿企业还举办了全日制的大专学校。在大办业余教育中，各地进一步贯彻了“结合生产、统一安排、因材施教、灵活多样”的原则，使业余教育同生产紧密结合，得到妥善安排，办学形式也有很多新的发展。特别是各地所进行的教学改革试验工作，已经创造和摸索了一些宝贵的经验，对于进一步贯彻党的教育方针，多快好省地培养建设人材起了积极的作用。
    会议认为，上半年的业余教育的巨大成就，为下半年的继续跃进打下了良好基础。下半年业余教育工作的任务应该是：继续贯彻“巩固起来、坚持下去、提高质量、继续发展”的方针，在秋后掀起一个更大规模的扫盲运动、群众学习运动，和群众性的教学改革高潮，为保质保量地完成今年的计划而努力。
    会议指出，下半年的扫盲工作和业余初等教育必须狠抓、细抓。注音识字是加速扫除文盲和普及业余初等教育的重要方法，必须积极推行。随着扫盲工作的进展，青壮年中的文盲比例逐渐减小了，学习中的困难逐渐增多，剩下的文盲更加分散，要完成扫盲任务还相当艰巨。但是也必须看到扫盲工作的有利因素也越来越多，广大的非文盲包围着文盲，师资问题比较好解决，教学经验比过去更丰富了。会议要求各地区、各业务系统和基层单位，大抓文盲的摸底工作。摸底是为了做到心中有数，以便积极地实事求是地进行扫盲工作。
    会议认为，扫盲和业余初等教育要紧密衔接，一气呵成。今后扫完一批文盲，就要升学一批。会议要求“大办业余专业教育，以便尽快地解决生产上所需要的技术力量，要求业余教育由初级到高级，由不完备到完备，逐步成网成系。”
    会议指出，教学改革是教育上的不断革命。工农业余教育虽然经过了一些改革，但还存在着资产阶级教育思想的影响。为了适应工农业生产大跃进和技术大革命的新形势的要求，在教学内容、教学方法上适应成人特点等，还必须进一步进行教学改革。会议认为，教学改革必须以毛泽东思想为指导，体现社会主义建设总路线的精神，从而达到多快好省地培养建设人才，加速工农群众知识化的目的；既要适应当前社会主义革命和社会主义建设的需要，又要有一个长远的目标。我们的长远目标是培养工农群众成为既有高度的共产主义觉悟，又有现代的文化科学知识，既能从事体力劳动，又能从事脑力劳动的劳动者。根据这一要求，业余教育按照“结合生产，因材施教”的原则，使工农群众尽快地先专本行，在生产岗位上发挥作用，这在目前是主要的方面。另一方面，也要针对工农群众的具体条件，使他们逐步成为“多能”，掌握向尖端科学进军所需要的深广的知识。会议指出，业余教育工作和教学改革，必须走群众路线，发动群众积极性，大胆创造，百花齐放。
    国务院业余教育委员会主任林枫在这次会议上做了重要讲话。他指出，工农业余教育正面临大发展、大提高、坚持经常、不断革命的大好形势。这种形势是在中央和各级党委的领导下，由思想革命、技术革命和文化革命紧密结合、相互推动而形成的。在这样持续跃进的形势下，他要求把业余教育工作做得更踏实，更有力量，不要自满，不要松劲，坚决地在两三年内基本上扫除全国青壮年中的文盲和紧跟着普及业余初等教育，巩固提高、继续发展业余中等教育和高等教育，积极进行教学改革和加强领导等。他还指出，业余教育必须坚持经常和注意劳逸结合问题。
