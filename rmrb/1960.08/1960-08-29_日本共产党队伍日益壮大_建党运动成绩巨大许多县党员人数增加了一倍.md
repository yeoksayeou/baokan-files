    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 26th: The number of members of the Japanese Communist Party has doubled in many counties.
    According to the "Akahata" newspaper, in response to the call of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, the local organizations of the Japanese Communist Party have launched a nationwide movement to develop party membership since last summer. Currently, five counties—Saga, Ibaraki, Toyama, Fukui, and Fukuoka—have achieved the goal of doubling the number of party members. "Akahata" pointed out that the number of party members in Fukuoka County has increased by 100.4% compared to June last year. It is of great significance that Fukuoka County, which has a large industrial and mining area and a strong party organization, has completed the task of doubling its party members. "Akahata" reported that the Saga County Party organization was the first to complete the goal of doubling party members. The number of party members in this county had increased to 303% of the number on June 1 last year by August 19. The Hokkaido Committee, at a meeting held on August 20, even set a goal of tripling party membership.
    According to reports, party organizations in Osaka, Kobe, Tokyo, and other places have also held regional party activist meetings one after another to discuss the issue of redoubling efforts to develop party members.
