    Deeply Understand Production Realities, Grasp Development Laws, Persistently Focus from Beginning to End, Rely on the Masses' Hard Struggle
    Fuxin's Five Transportation Revolutions Exponentially Increased Transportation Efficiency
    Vehicle dwell time at stations reduced from an average of twelve hours to four and a half hours, ensuring the sustained leap forward in coal production
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, while focusing on coal production, simultaneously focused on railway transportation. For over a year, they have been diligently working, constantly developing the experiences of road-mine collaboration, and have organized five transportation revolutions, which have exponentially increased transportation efficiency. Before the implementation of road-mine collaboration in 1958, the average dwell time of vehicles at Fuxin Station was twelve hours. In 1959, it was reduced to an average of 6.9 hours, and in the first half of this year, it was further reduced to an average of 5.2 hours. In July, it was further reduced to 4.5 hours. The leap forward in railway transportation has guaranteed and promoted the leap forward in coal production. Fuxin's coal production in 1958 increased by 80% compared to 1957, and in 1959, it increased by 38.8% compared to 1958. In the first half of this year, the entire mine exceeded the state plan every month, and the production level continued to increase month by month.
    Fuxin is one of China's largest coal bases. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, coal production surged. Initially, railway transportation could not keep up, which greatly affected the production of coal mines. In November 1958, the amount of coal lying on the ground in Fuxin reached as high as 1.5 million tons. The Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China learned from this lesson. In order to reverse the situation where railway transportation lagged behind coal production, they focused on transportation as the key, mobilized the masses to vigorously promote road-mine collaboration, and created the famous "Twelve Unifications" road-mine collaboration experience, transforming the road and mine into one entity, and doubling transportation efficiency. For more than a year, Fuxin has consistently adhered to road-mine collaboration and has continuously developed this experience. It started with road-mine collaboration and developed into a "one-dragon" transportation collaboration among all enterprises in the city. Then, the "one-dragon" collaboration within Fuxin City developed into a combination with "one-dragon" transportation collaboration with the outside, opening up "circular dragon trains." The "circular dragon trains" departed from Fuxin, passed through various stations without the need for transfer, disassembly, or marshalling, and went directly to the dedicated lines of coal-using factories and mines in various places, achieving door-to-door delivery. After unloading, the empty trains returned to Fuxin on the same day for a second loading. This cycle greatly improved the utilization rate of vehicles. Currently, the destinations of "circular dragon trains" include Shenyang, Anshan, Lüda, Jinzhou, and other places.
    In order to ensure the leap forward in coal production, Fuxin City, while continuously developing the "one-dragon" transportation collaboration, also concentrated its efforts on five large-scale transportation revolutions. The first was a revolution in transportation organization, organizing large-scale collaboration in production, supply, transportation, and sales, and opening up "Red Flag Trains" (i.e., trains with an operation time of four hours). After the emergence of "Red Flag Trains," transportation efficiency was greatly improved, but the contradiction of insufficient loading capacity was exposed. So, the second revolution was immediately carried out, building twelve mechanized and semi-mechanized coal storage and loading facilities, increasing loading efficiency elevenfold. After the loading efficiency improved, vehicles needed to accelerate their turnaround, which conflicted with the unreasonable station layout. Therefore, the third revolution was organized to comprehensively transform the station lines, changing angular driving to circular driving, and changing one marshalling point to multiple marshalling points, increasing the passing capacity of the station lines from the original 700 to 800 vehicles to 1,500 to 1,600 vehicles. At this time, loading became a weak link again, so the fourth revolution was carried out to technically transform two large-scale mechanized and semi-mechanized coal bunkers after selection, increasing the storage capacity of refined coal from 3,800 tons to 12,000 tons, and expanding five automatic loading lines. Previously, each loading line could only load a dozen vehicles at a time, but after the expansion, it could load 50 or 60 vehicles. A train slowly passed under the loading bunker, and could be fully loaded in a few minutes.
    Now, Fuxin is carrying out the fifth transportation revolution, conducting a comprehensive overall transformation of all road and mine lines on the basis of the overall transformation of station lines. According to the requirements of this overall transformation, the arrival and departure line groups and marshalling operation line groups of the station will be connected with the loading line groups of the coal mines; connecting lines between the railway trunk lines and Fuxin Station will be added; connecting lines between coal mines will be added; the station's internal lines will be moved and extended, and parallel lines and marshalling line groups will be added. After the completion of various projects, the line passing capacity will increase from 2,200 vehicles to 3,400 vehicles, and the vehicle dwell time can be shortened to less than three hours.
    A very important reason why Fuxin's railway transportation and coal production have achieved such great results is that the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has always carried forward a down-to-earth work style. In addition to a secretary in the municipal committee being assigned to manage transportation, a transportation command was also established, implementing "three grasps a day" (grasping every train, grasping every moment, grasping every shift) and "three grasps a month" (grasping a good start at the beginning of the month, grasping daily red during normal times, grasping red to the end at the end of the month to prepare for the next month). The secretary of the municipal committee in charge of transportation and the director of the mining bureau in charge of transportation hold one or two mass joint conferences that go to the grassroots every month. Railway workers, coal mine workers, and workers from various unloading enterprises concerned participate in the conference. At the meeting, the secretary of the municipal committee and the director of the mining bureau personally explain the situation and assign tasks to the workers, so that the party's intentions are implemented to the grassroots, and they organize the workers to freely express their opinions. This type of meeting not only plays a role in mobilizing all enterprises in the city to organize "one-dragon" transportation collaboration, but also plays a role in leaders connecting with the masses and workers participating in management. Through rich practical activities in leading transportation work, the leading comrades of the municipal committee have truly achieved a deep understanding of the relationship between production and transportation, as well as the relationship between various links within transportation work. The workers praised them as "transportation experts."
    Because of their deep understanding of production realities, the municipal committee can promptly discover problems, summarize the experiences of the masses, and propose solutions. The five transportation revolutions were organized in this way. Moreover, in each transportation revolution, the municipal committee foresaw the goal of the second revolution, prepared for the second revolution, and immediately started the next revolution when this revolution ended. In this way, one campaign after another, one wave higher than another, enabled transportation work to continuously leap forward in the continuous resolution of contradictions. In each transportation revolution, the municipal committee emphasized mobilizing the masses to work hard, adhering to the principle of self-reliance as the main factor and striving for foreign assistance as a supplementary factor, and adopting the method of concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles, so that the work can be more effective more quickly. Now, Fuxin road and mine workers are full of confidence to further shorten the dwell time of vehicles at stations and improve transportation efficiency this year, so that coal production can achieve a greater and better leap forward.

    深入生产实际  掌握发展规律  自始至终抓紧  群众艰苦奋斗
    阜新五次运输革命成倍提高运输效率
    车辆在站停留时间由平均十二小时缩短到四小时半，保证了煤炭生产持续跃进
    本报讯　中共阜新市委一手抓煤炭生产，一手抓铁路运输，一年多来始终踏踏实实地埋头苦干，不断地发展路矿协作的经验，并且组织了五次运输革命，使运输效率成倍地提高。1958年，没有实行路矿协作以前，阜新车站的车辆在站停留时间平均达十二小时，1959年缩短到平均六点九小时，今年上半年又进一步缩短到平均五点二小时，7月份更缩短为四点五小时。铁路运输的跃进，保证和促进了煤炭生产的跃进。1958年阜新的煤炭产量比1957年增长了80％，1959年又比1958年增长了38.8％，今年上半年，全矿月月超额完成国家计划，生产水平继续逐月提高。
    阜新是我国最大的煤炭基地之一。1958年大跃进以后，煤炭产量激增，铁路运输在开始的时候没有能跟上去，给煤矿的生产造成了很大的影响。1958年11月，阜新的落地煤曾多达一百五十万吨。中共阜新市委吸取了这个教训，为了扭转铁路运输落后于煤炭生产的局面，便把运输作为关键，发动群众大搞路矿协作，创造了著名的“十二统一”路矿协作经验，变路矿两家为路矿一家，使运输效率增长了一倍。一年多来，阜新始终坚持路矿协作，并且不断地发展了这项经验。始而是由路矿协作发展为全市各个企业的“一条龙”运输大协作；继而又由阜新市内的“一条龙”大协作发展到同外部“一条龙”运输大协作结合起来，大开“循环龙车”。“循环龙车”由阜新发车，路经各站不必中转、解体、编组，直达各地用煤厂矿的专用线，做到了送货上门；各地卸车后，空车当日返回阜新，再组织第二次装车。如此循环周转，大大提高了车辆的利用率。目前，“循环龙车”到达的地点已有沈阳、鞍山、旅大、锦州等地。
    为了保证煤炭生产的跃进，阜新市在不断发展“一条龙”运输大协作的同时，还集中力量进行了五次大规模的运输革命。第一次是运输组织工作上的革命，组织产供运销的大协作，大开“红旗列车”（即一次作业时间为四小时的列车）。“红旗列车”出现后，运输效率大为提高，装车力量不足的矛盾暴露出来了，于是紧接着进行第二次革命，修建了十二座机械化半机械化贮煤装车设备，使装车效率提高了十一倍。装车效率提高后，车辆要加速周转，同不合理的站线布局又发生了矛盾，所以又组织了第三次革命，对车站站线进行总体改造，变折角行车为环线行车，变一处编组为多处编组，使站线通过能力由原来的七百车至八百车提高到一千五百车至一千六百车。这时，装车又成为薄弱环节了，于是又进行第四次革命，对两座大型机械化半机械化选后煤仓进行技术改造，使精选煤炭的贮存量由三千八百吨，提高到一万二千吨，并且扩建了五条自动装车线。以前每条装车线一次只能装十几车，扩建后可装五、六十车，一列车在装车仓下徐徐通过，几分钟内即可全部装满。
    现在，阜新正在进行第五次运输革命，在车站站线总体改造的基础上，进行路矿所有线路的全面总体改造。根据这次总体改造的要求，将把车站的到发线群、编组作业线群同煤矿的装车线群联结起来；增设铁路干线和阜新车站之间的联络线；增设煤矿与煤矿之间的联络线；移设和延长站内线路，增加平行线路和编组线群。各项工程竣工以后，线路通过能力将由两千二百车提高到三千四百车，车辆停留时间可缩短到三小时以下。
    阜新铁路运输和煤炭生产能够取得这样大的成绩，一个很重要的原因，是中共阜新市委始终发扬了踏踏实实的工作作风。市委除有一名书记分工管运输外，并设立了运输指挥部，实行“一日三抓”（列列抓、时时抓、班班抓）和“一月三抓”（月初抓开门红、平时抓日日红、月末抓红到底给下月作准备）。市委分工管运输的书记和矿务局分工管运输的局长，每月召开一、两次一竿子插到底的群众联合大会。参加大会的有铁路职工、煤矿职工和有关卸车各企业的职工。会上由市委书记和矿务局长亲自向职工讲形势，交任务，使党的意图一竿子插到底，并组织职工大鸣大放，畅所欲言。这种会既起到动员全市各企业组织“一条龙”运输大协作的作用，又起到领导联系群众、工人参加管理的作用。通过对领导运输工作的丰富的实践活动，市委的领导同志对于生产和运输的关系以及运输工作内部各个环节的关系真正做到了深知深解，工人们称赞他们是“运输专家”。
    由于对生产实际深知深解，市委能够及时地发现问题，总结群众的经验，提出解决问题的办法。五次运输革命就是这样组织的。而且在每一次运输革命的过程中，市委就预见到第二次革命的目标，为第二次革命做好准备，当这一次革命结束，立即开始下一次革命。这样，一个战役接一个战役，一浪高过一浪，使运输工作在不断解决矛盾中不断地跃进。在每一次的运输革命中，市委都强调发动群众艰苦奋斗，坚持自力更生为主、力争外援为辅的方针，并且采用集中优势兵力打歼灭战的办法，使工作更快地收到实效。现在，阜新路矿职工正满怀信心地要在今年进一步缩短车辆在站停留时间，提高运输效率，使煤炭生产实现更大更好的跃进。（附图片）
