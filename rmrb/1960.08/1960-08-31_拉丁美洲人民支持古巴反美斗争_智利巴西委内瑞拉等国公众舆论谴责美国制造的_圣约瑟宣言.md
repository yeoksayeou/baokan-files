Xinhua News Agency, August 30th – Latin American countries' public opinion supports the solemn position of the Cuban delegation at the Organization of American States' Foreign Ministers' Meeting and condemns the so-called "Declaration of San José" passed under U.S. pressure at the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers.

Chile's "El Siglo" published the news of Cuba's withdrawal from the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers on the 29th in large font and in a prominent position, and accused the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers of not condemning the crimes of bombing Cuban sugarcane fields and conducting conspiracies in Cuba. "La Hora Última's" editorial said that Latin America stands with Cuba. The shameful resolution of the San José Conference will be condemned by history, and it is already being condemned by the people of various countries.

According to Caracas reports, popular organizations in Venezuela generally support the position of Cuban Foreign Minister Roa in withdrawing from the Foreign Ministers' Meeting and welcome Venezuelan Foreign Minister Arcaya's failure to sign the declaration. The ongoing Federal District Regional Congress of the Republican Democratic Union decided to condemn the resolution of the Organization of American States. The party's national leadership is holding an emergency meeting.

According to Latin American News Agency reports, in view of the United States' crude pressure on representatives of Latin American countries at the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of American States, a new wave of mass actions to defend Cuba is being launched in Latin American countries.

Brazilian Senator Fontes condemned the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers for protecting the interests of U.S. monopoly capital. He emphasized that the United States often uses the old tune of "anti-communism" to "suffocate small countries through economic and military means."

People's demonstrations and rallies in support of the Cuban revolution were held in the Colombian capital, and leaders of various trade unions, youth students, the Free Revolutionary Movement, and representatives of the Communist Party unanimously condemned the U.S. policy of intervention at the meeting.

The Costa Rican Association of Friends of the Cuban Revolution telegraphed similar organizations in Latin American countries to condemn the conspiracy of the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers to interfere in the Cuban revolution. (Attached photo)
