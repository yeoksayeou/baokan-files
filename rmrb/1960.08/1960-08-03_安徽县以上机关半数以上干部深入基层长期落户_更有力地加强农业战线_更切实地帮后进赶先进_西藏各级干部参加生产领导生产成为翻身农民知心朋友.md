　　Hefei, August 2nd (by our newspaper) – The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has transferred more than half of the leading backbone personnel and outstanding cadres from organs at the county level and above to go deep into the front lines of agricultural production for a year, two years, or even longer, to sit, work, and take responsibility for helping poor teams and backward teams completely change their appearance. Industrial departments at the county level and above have also transferred a large number of cadres to go deep into factories and mines, strengthen the leadership at the front lines, and improve industrial production, so as to better support agriculture.

　　More than 28,000 cadres from county-level and above organs across the province have been transferred to rural areas. The cadres from provincial-level organs who have been approved to go to rural areas have already left for work in various places.

　　This time, Anhui Province's transfer of cadres to rural areas and factories to strengthen the front lines of production is large-scale, with clear tasks and significant meaning. The proportion of cadres transferred from provincial-level organs accounts for 50% of the total number of cadres in the organs, and in many organs, the number of cadres who applied and were approved to go to rural areas accounts for 60% to 70% of the total number of cadres in the organs. Units such as the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Civil Affairs have transferred more than 80% of their cadres to rural areas. The cadres determined to go to rural areas in various prefectural committees and special district-level organs generally account for 60% of the total number of cadres in the organs, and county-level organs account for 70%. The length of time cadres stay is longer than any previous time, generally one year, two years, or even longer. All regions and units emphasized good political ideology, strong work responsibility, and good mass viewpoint as conditions for this transfer of cadres, and a considerable number of them are long-tested leading backbone personnel of the Party. For example, three of the five department heads of the Provincial Department of Agriculture went down, along with eleven division-level cadres and twenty-four section-level cadres.

　　These cadres who go to rural areas adopt the method of "插一竿子插到底" [inserting a pole to the very bottom - meaning getting deeply involved], take responsibility on a production team basis, take root and settle down in production teams, take on the leadership work of production teams, sit and work in a long-term and responsible manner, change the face of backward teams and poor teams, and ensure a more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production. Cadres will be sent to more than 2,000 poor teams and backward teams across the province (accounting for 20% of the province's production teams). Each brigade must also have a county-level or above cadre serving as the brigade leader or deputy brigade leader, general branch secretary or deputy secretary. The large-scale dispatch of cadres to rural areas is not only to change the face of backward teams and poor teams, but also to actively cultivate successors, so that after the cadres who go to rural areas leave, there will be a group of strong cadres from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds to take over the work.

　　Lhasa, August 2nd (by our newspaper) – Party secretaries and cadres at all levels in Tibet have gone deep into the front lines of agricultural production, and together with hundreds of thousands of emancipated Tibetan peasants, while vigorously grasping the review of democratic reform work, they are firmly grasping the late-stage field management of main food crops such as highland barley and wheat, to ensure a bumper harvest.

　　This year, the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China has consistently placed agricultural production in an important position in areas where the democratic reform has been completed. Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet and secretary of Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhou Renshan, deputy secretary, have successively gone to Lhasa, Shannan, and Nyingchi, major agricultural areas in Tibet, to inspect and arrange democratic reform and agricultural production. Panchen Erdeni, acting chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, also personally inspected the rural areas of Toelung Dechen County, encouraging Tibetan peasants to make persistent efforts, do a good job in field management, and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

　　In June this year, the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China transferred a large number of cadres from various organs to go deep into the front lines of agricultural production, and eat, live, work, and discuss with Tibetan peasants, participating in and leading production. The agricultural district work committees, county committees, and district committees also moved their command posts to the fields, thereby promoting this year's agricultural production in Tibet, with each link closely connected to the next, and each wave higher than the previous. Zhang Pingfan, secretary of the Nyingchi Sub-district Committee of the Communist Party of China, has lived in rural areas for most of his time since spring planting, specifically leading production. In Dazi County, due to the implementation of the "two-five" system [likely referring to a specific labor or work system], the county party secretary and district and township cadres have gone deep into the fields, greatly changing production. In the Bangna and Lamu districts of this county, 3,000 to 5,000 jin of topdressing fertilizer have been applied to each "克" [an area of land]. When repairing canals, Deputy County Chief Wangdui took the lead in working in the water, encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses.

　　The vast number of Tibetan and Han cadres working in rural areas have been praised by the masses as their "closest friends," "own children," and "sweethearts" because they have implemented the "four togethers and one exchange" (eating together, living together, working together, discussing together, and exchanging hearts). Ciren Zhuoma, a Tibetan female cadre, Communist Party member from Linong Township, Sangri County, has been living with the former slaves and poor serfs in rural areas for more than a year, except when attending meetings in the county and district, to understand the situation and publicize the Party's policies. This spring, Ciren Zhuoma helped the masses sow sixteen "克" of land. While working, she constantly studied production issues with the emancipated peasants. Under her promotion, all mutual aid teams in the township have established local fertilizer plants, producing more than 900,000 jin of local fertilizer in two months. Ciren Zhuoma also regularly conducts political and ideological education and class education for the emancipated peasants. She used her own difficult life experience to expose the crimes of the feudal serf system to the masses, enlighten the masses' class consciousness, and strengthen the unity among the working people. Once, she discovered that the daily labor attendance rate of the Qimei Yangji mutual aid team was only about 80%. After detailed understanding, she learned that the team leader's work attitude was stiff and he did not listen to the opinions of the masses enough, which affected everyone's production mood. Ciren Zhuoma immediately helped the team leader Qimei Yangji to review his shortcomings to everyone and formulated the necessary labor system. After the problem was solved, everyone felt comfortable, unity was strengthened, and the labor attendance rate quickly rose to 100%. The people of the entire township praised Ciren Zhuoma as a "good daughter of the Party."

　　The leading organs of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet have also recently sent a group of officers from peasant backgrounds with production experience to the front lines of agricultural production, and together with Tibetan peasants, they are seizing the harvest.

    安徽县以上机关半数以上干部深入基层长期落户
    更有力地加强农业战线  更切实地帮后进赶先进
    西藏各级干部参加生产领导生产成为翻身农民知心朋友
    本报合肥2日电　中共安徽省委从县以上各级机关抽调一半以上的领导骨干和优秀干部，以一年、两年以至更长的时间，深入到农业生产第一线去，特别是到穷队、后进队去，坐点包干，负责帮助穷队和后进队彻底改变面貌。县以上各级工业部门，也抽调大批干部深入厂矿，加强第一线的领导，搞好工业生产，以便更好地支援农业。
    全省抽调下乡的县以上机关的干部有两万八千多人。省级机关被批准下乡的干部，已出发到各地工作。
    安徽省这次抽调干部下乡下厂加强生产第一线，声势浩大、任务明确、意义重大。省级机关抽调的比例占机关干部总人数的50％，有不少机关报名后被批准下乡的干部，占本机关干部人数的60％到70％。像农业厅、民政厅等单位抽调下乡的干部达到80％以上。各地委和专区级机关，确定下乡的干部一般占机关干部总人数的60％，县级机关占70％。干部下去的时间比过去任何一次都长，一般都是一年、两年，以至更长的时间。各地区各单位这次抽调干部都强调政治思想好、工作责任心强、群众观点好等条件，其中有相当一部分是久经锻炼的党的领导骨干。例如省农业厅五个厅长，就下去三个，同时下去的还有处长级干部十一人，科长级干部二十四人。
    这些下乡的干部采取一竿子插到底的办法，按生产队进行包干，到生产队去扎根落户，担任生产队的领导工作，长期坐点包干，改变后进队和穷队的面貌，保证农业生产更全面地跃进。全省二千多个穷队和后进队（占全省生产队的20％），都要派干部去。每个大队并且都要有一个县级以上干部担任大队长或副队长、总支书记或副书记。大批干部下乡，不仅是要改变后进队和穷队的面貌，同时还要积极培养接班人，做到下乡干部离开以后，有一批坚强的贫农、下中农出身的干部接替工作。
    本报拉萨2日电　西藏各级党委书记和干部，深入农业生产第一线，和几十万翻身藏族农民一起，在大抓民主改革的复查工作同时，狠抓青稞、小麦等主粮作物的后期田间管理，确保丰收。
    今年，中共西藏工委在已完成民主改革的地区，一直把农业生产放在重要地位。中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武、副书记周仁山，都先后到拉萨、山南和林芝等西藏主要农业区，检查和安排民主改革和农业生产。自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼，也亲自到堆龙德庆县农村视察，鼓励藏族农民们再接再厉，搞好田间管理，争取今年农业大丰收。
    今年6月间，中共西藏工委从各机关抽调了大批干部深入农业生产第一线，和藏族农民同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，参加生产领导生产。各农业区分工委、县委、区委也纷纷把指挥部搬到田间，从而促使西藏今年的农业生产，一环紧扣一环，一浪高过一浪。中共林芝分工委书记张平凡，自从春播以来，大部分时间都住在农村，具体领导生产。达孜县由于推行了“二五”制，县委书记和区乡干部都深入田间，使生产大为改观。这个县的帮纳、拉木等区，每克地已施追肥三千至五千斤。在修渠时，副县长旺堆带头下水劳动，鼓舞了群众的干劲。
    在农村工作的广大藏、汉族干部，由于贯彻实行了“四同一交”（同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量和交心），被群众誉为是他们的“最亲密的朋友”、“亲生的儿女”和“心上人”。桑日县李浓乡藏族女干部、共产党员次仁卓玛，一年多来，除了到县、区开会外，在农村经常和原先的奴隶、贫苦农奴们住在一起，了解情况，宣传党的政策。今年春天，次仁卓玛帮助群众播种了十六克土地。她一边劳动，一边和翻身农民们随时研究生产中的问题。在她的推动下，全乡各互助组都建立了土化肥厂，两个月时间就造出土化肥九十多万斤。次仁卓玛还经常对翻身农民进行政治思想教育和阶级教育。她用自己的苦难身世，向群众揭露封建农奴制度的罪恶，启发群众的阶级觉悟，加强劳动人民之间的团结。有一次，她发现其美洋吉互助组每天的劳动出勤率只有80％左右，经过详细了解，才知道组长工作态度生硬，倾听群众的意见不够，因而影响了大家的生产情绪。次仁卓玛立即帮助组长其美洋吉向大家检查了自己的缺点，并订出了必要的劳动制度。问题解决后，大家心情舒畅，团结加强，劳动出勤率很快上升到100％。全乡人民都夸奖次仁卓玛是“党的好女儿”。
    驻藏人民解放军领导机关，最近也把一批农民出身、有生产经验的军官派到了农业生产的最前线，和藏族农民们一起夺取丰收。（附图片）
