The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Congress called on all the people of the region to increase grain and steel production by every possible means.

(Reported in this newspaper) The Third Session of the Second People's Congress of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was held in Hohhot from the 15th to the 21st. The meeting called on people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region to immediately launch a production increase and economy drive centered on grain and steel, and requested all communes, enterprises, institutions, schools, and troops to mobilize the masses to discuss and formulate production increase and economy plans for the next four months, along with specific measures to achieve these plans, to muster greater revolutionary vigor, and to strive for the sustained leap forward in 1960.

During the meeting, Ulanhu，First Secretary of the CPC Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee and Chairman of the Autonomous Region, delivered an important speech. Yang Zhilin, Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region, delivered a report on "Launching a Production Increase and Economy Movement Centered on Grain and Steel, and Striving for the Sustained Leap Forward in 1960" on behalf of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee.

The meeting believed that the current political and economic situation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is very good. The total industrial output value of the region in the first half of this year increased by 77.7% compared with the same period last year, completing 51.4% of the annual industrial output value plan. Compared with the same period last year, the output of major products such as steel, raw coal, and timber has greatly increased. On the agricultural front, the policy of taking grain as the key link and making overall arrangements, as well as the simultaneous approach of multiple planting and harvesting and less planting with high yield and multiple harvesting, has been further implemented. At the same time, the people's communes have been further consolidated and reorganized, and a large amount of wasteland has been reclaimed, overfulfilling the sowing plan. At present, field crops are growing well. In animal husbandry production, the number of young animals bred and surviving this year in the region is 300,000 more than the total number of livestock in 1947, the year the autonomous region was established. The number of pigs in pens has increased by 17.1% compared with the beginning of the year. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement has also entered a new stage. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in industrial enterprises has greatly increased, and labor productivity has also greatly improved. The mass movement in all walks of life to support agriculture and animal husbandry is developing in depth.

The meeting pointed out that the most urgent task currently facing the people of all ethnic groups in the region is to seize the current favorable opportunity, make full use of all favorable factors, mobilize all forces, immediately launch a production increase and economy drive centered on grain and steel, increase grain and steel production by every possible means, and achieve a comprehensive leap forward in the national economy this year. To this end, it is necessary to further strengthen the agricultural and animal husbandry front, with the whole party and all the people engaging in agriculture and grain production on a large scale. It is necessary to make the greatest determination to transfer all possible labor to field production, concentrate efforts to focus on the three months of August, September, and October, immediately launch a large-scale grain production increase movement, strengthen field management in the later stages, fully prepare for the autumn harvest, and achieve meticulous harvesting and threshing to ensure that every grain is stored in the granary, and carry out the "small autumn harvest" movement. Increased animal husbandry production must take the "100 mothers, 100 offspring" movement as the key link, launch a production increase and livestock protection movement, and do a good job in preparing livestock for winter and spring. Industrial production must focus on steel, coal, mining, and transportation, and concentrate efforts to raise steel production to a new level. All departments must combine the current production increase and economy movement, adopt the method of combining leaders, workers, and technicians, further carry out technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale, and organize, appraise, and promote existing inventions.

The meeting pointed out that leaders at all levels must pay attention to the lives of the masses as much as they pay attention to production, pay attention to the combination of work and rest, and do a good job in the lives of the masses. Leaders at all levels must strengthen the leadership and management of rural public canteens. Canteens must plan the use of grain and save grain, raise pigs and chickens on a large scale, grow vegetables on a large scale, actively store pickled vegetables, and ensure that the masses are well-fed. In arranging life, it is necessary to implement the policy of building the country and managing households diligently and thriftily, and further promote the spirit of hard work and plain living, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. The meeting emphatically pointed out that in order to achieve a sustained leap forward in 1960, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party, improve the style of work, transfer a group of cadres to strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level, and strengthen the forefront of production. It is necessary to continue to educate the vast number of cadres to carry forward the fine tradition of sharing weal and woe with the masses, and establish a work style of going deep into reality, maintaining close ties with the masses, being down-to-earth, and seeking truth from facts.

At this meeting, the representatives elected Jiyatay (Mongolian), Gao Zengpei, Liu Jingping, and Punsuk (Mongolian) as vice chairmen of the autonomous region by secret ballot.
