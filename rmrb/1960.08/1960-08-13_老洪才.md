    Old Hongcai
    Yu Fusheng
    Old Hongcai, sixty-nine,
    Full of vigor when he works;
    Since the village set up a big canteen,
    Men and women, old and young, are all smiles,
    The canteen needed a steward,
    Old Hongcai volunteered to take the job;
    He only knows about a hundred characters,
    But in three days he mastered the multiplication table;
    It's really true: an eighty-year-old man learned to play the suona horn.
    This doggerel, cleverly composed by Wang Dacai, spread quickly among the commune members. The story is like this: At first, the canteen was set up, the cooks were found, and the pots and pans were all prepared. But, such a large canteen needed a steward. It was truly "everything is ready, except the east wind." Wang Dabao, the brigade secretary, thought about it and felt that Old Hongcai was the most suitable, but he was afraid that he couldn't handle the abacus and the writing. There was no way, Secretary Wang decided to let Old Hongcai get started first, anyway, the canteen had to have a head.
    "Grandpa Hongcai, the canteen is up and running," Secretary Wang didn't even need to say it, Old Hongcai already knew. His ears are very sharp.
    "Good, now this old man doesn't have to worry," Old Hongcai said with a happy smile, stroking his beard.
    "Grandpa Hongcai, the canteen is short of a steward."
    "Then find one!"
    "The Great Leap Forward, all aspects need people, labor is so tight, we can't find any young people." Secretary Wang said, while staring at Old Hongcai.
    "Dabao, do you think I can do it?" Old Hongcai asked after a long pause.
    "Excellent, it's just..."
    "Just what? Afraid I can't write or calculate? Bah, I'm only sixty-nine years old, still young! Can't I learn? ...I've decided to take on this burden."
    Old Hongcai's straightforwardness, willingness to work, and fearlessness of difficulties were well known in the village.
    The next day, as soon as Old Hongcai took office, the menu was announced on the blackboard: "Braised Chinese cabbage, boiled radish soup, one serving of each for everyone."
    As a steward, he has to plan the rice and vegetables every day. How can he do it all in his head? So Old Hongcai was determined to march towards the abacus. He was obsessed, clinging to the brigade accountant, starting with the "small multiplication table," because, in his words, he had to at least learn "the lion rolling the embroidered ball." At night, not only could he not sleep, but even the accountant stayed up with him. "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it." In just three days, Old Hongcai was able to use the abacus to calculate the next day's food bill.

    老洪才
    余福生
    老洪才，六十九，
    干起活来劲抖抖；
    自从村里办起了大食堂，
    男女老少喜眉头，
    食堂缺少个事务长，
    洪才爷自动报名他来揪；
    他总共认不上百把字，
    三天就会了小九九；
    这真是：八十岁老翁学成了吹鼓手。
    机灵的王大才编的顺口溜，眨眼工夫就在社员中间传开了。事情是这样的：开头，食堂搞好了，炊事员也物色好了，锅碗瓢盏也都准备好了。但是，偌大的两个食堂，总得有个事务长才行呀。真是“万事俱备，只缺东风”。大队支书王大保想来想去，只有老洪才比较合适，但又怕他算盘、笔下弄不来。没办法，王支书决定叫老洪才先上马再说，反正食堂总得有个头。
    “洪才爷，食堂办起来了。”王支书不说，老洪才也知道了。他的耳朵可尖哩。
    “好啊，这下子我老头子甭操心了。”老洪才摸摸胡子乐滋滋地说。
    “洪才爷，食堂少个事务长哩。”
    “找呗！”
    “大跃进呀，各方面都需要人，劳力这么紧，年青人找不出来。”王支书一面说着，一面用眼盯着老洪才。
    “大保，你看我行不？”老洪才停了半晌说。
    “好极了，就是……”
    “就是什么？怕我不会写不会算是不？呔，我刚六十九岁，还小哩！不能学吗？……这担子我是挑定了。”
    老洪才的直率、肯干、不怕困难，是村里人人皆知的。
    第二天，老洪才一上任，小黑板上就公布了菜单：“红烧大白菜，白烧萝卜汤，每人听挑一份。”
    当事务长，天天都得计划米计划菜的，都是用脑子算哪能行呢？于是老洪才下决心向算盘进军。他就像着了迷一样，死命缠住大队会计不放，从“小九九”学起，照他的说法是：起码也得学会“狮子滚绣球”。夜里，不仅他自己睡不着觉，连会计也陪着熬夜。“天下无难事，只怕有心人”，也不过三天工夫，老洪才就能用算盘扒啦第二天的菜账了。
