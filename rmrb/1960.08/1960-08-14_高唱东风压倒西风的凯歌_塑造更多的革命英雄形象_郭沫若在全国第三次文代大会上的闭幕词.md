Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: Guo Moruo's closing address at the Third National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers. The full text is as follows:

    The Third National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers is about to conclude!

    This congress is a celebration of victory for Chinese literary and art workers, and also a mobilization meeting to further strengthen unity and strive for greater victories!

    At this congress, Comrade Lu Dingyi delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun made reports on the domestic and international situation and on literary and artistic work. Our beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman Song Qingling, Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Zhu De, Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping, and other party and state leaders received all of our representatives. All of this demonstrated the Party's infinite concern for literary and artistic undertakings, and all literary and art workers received tremendous encouragement and profound education.

    At this congress, we made a comprehensive assessment of the great achievements of literature and art in the eleven years since the founding of the People's Republic. Over the past eleven years, our literature and art have reflected the struggles of the Chinese people in various stages of the democratic revolution, the socialist revolution, and socialist construction. They have depicted and shaped numerous new heroic figures who have emerged in various revolutionary stages and on various fronts. Our literature and art have reflected our political struggles and economic construction, and have also promoted our political struggles and economic construction. Our literature and art have reflected real life and are full of the ideals of tomorrow. Our literature and art have expressed the vigorously developing communist spirit of the Chinese people and have used this spirit to educate and inspire the masses of the people. Our literature and art have a strong fighting spirit and a clear proletarian party spirit. The Party and the people have given a high evaluation of our literary and artistic undertakings. Comrade Lu Dingyi said in his congratulatory speech on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council: "A powerful literary and artistic contingent with workers, peasants and soldiers as the backbone has grown up." This contingent "has created many excellent works with both ideological and artistic merit, which are loved by the Chinese people." This assessment makes us feel extremely excited, and at the same time makes us realize the source of these achievements. The great achievements of Chinese literature and art fully demonstrate the correctness of the Party's leadership over literary and artistic undertakings, and mark the great victory of the Mao Zedong literary and artistic thought that has developed Marxism-Leninism!

    At this congress, we summarized the rich experience of literary and artistic work over the past eleven years, and further clarified the path of socialist literary and artistic development: implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, under the direction of serving the workers, peasants and soldiers and serving the socialist cause. This is the most correct and broadest path for the development of socialist literature and art. We say that this path is the most correct because it guides our literature and art to closely combine with proletarian politics and closely combine with the struggles of the workers, peasants and soldiers; it guides literary and art workers to increasingly become workers, peasants and soldiers. We say that this path is the broadest because it enables creations and performances of various styles and genres to compete for beauty and develop and prosper universally. This path guarantees the unity of political direction and the diversity of artistic styles, and solves the problem of who literature and art serve and how they serve. It resolutely opposes modern revisionism that castrates Marxism-Leninism, and also resolutely opposes dogmatism that only allows one flower to bloom. We have followed this path, which has enabled our literary and artistic undertakings to develop vigorously in the past years, and will surely make our literary and artistic undertakings develop more vigorously in the years to come. Dozens, hundreds, and thousands of literary and artistic detachments will advance firmly and courageously along this path!

    The current era is the era in which the East wind prevails over the West wind, the era in which imperialism is increasingly moving towards death and socialism is increasingly prosperous, and the era in which the just struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and colonialism is flourishing. Progressive and revolutionary literature and art must fully reflect this great era, sing the triumphant song of the era, and shape heroic images of revolutionary people with lofty ideals. In order to better accomplish this task, we advocate the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. This artistic method was proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong in order to enable literature and art to better reflect this heroic era, based on the combination of the Marxist-Leninist theory of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development, and the laws of development of literature and art themselves. It is a new crystallization of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art. Mastering this artistic method will not only be more conducive to expressing this new era and absorbing all the good traditions in the literary and artistic heritage, but also more conducive to giving full play to the different personalities and styles of writers and artists. This has opened up an incomparably vast world for our literature and art.

    At this congress, the Party called on us: "The primary task of our country's literary and artistic work is to use the weapons of literature and art to greatly raise the socialist and communist ideological consciousness of the people of the whole country and improve the communist moral character of the people of the whole country." This requires our literary and art workers to have a proletarian world outlook and a communist style, and then use the communist spirit to educate the people. In order to achieve this goal, we must first learn from the people, and the educator must first be educated. We must be good students of the masses before we can be good teachers of the masses. We must go deep into the masses of workers and peasants and become workers, peasants, and soldiers ourselves before we can acquire a proletarian world outlook and a communist style. We must work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and study Chairman Mao's works hard. We must have the desire, determination, and action to transform ourselves, and constantly transform our thinking. Whether we are old or young, whether we come from a worker-peasant background or a non-worker-peasant background, we must constantly transform our thinking so that we can become promoters of continuous revolution. Only then can our literary and artistic works complete the glorious task assigned to us by the Party.

    Imperialists and modern revisionists are our enemies and our negative teachers. What the enemy opposes us doing is exactly what we must do. Imperialists and modern revisionists hope that we will abolish or relax the socialist revolution in the political and ideological fields, and we must emphasize and strengthen the socialist revolution in the political and ideological fields. We must wage a resolute struggle against bourgeois ideology and modern revisionism. We must use the revolutionary historical materialism of the proletariat to smash the reactionary idealism of the bourgeoisie and modern revisionists. We must use the scientific class theory of the proletariat to smash the hypocritical humanism of the bourgeoisie and modern revisionists. We must shatter the illusions about imperialism spread by modern revisionists with resolute actions against imperialism and defending world peace.

    Comrades! In the past years, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our Chinese literary and art workers have carried out a series of struggles against all kinds of bourgeois ideology and achieved brilliant victories. In the years to come, we must unite more closely around the Party and Chairman Mao, so that our literature and art can achieve even more brilliant victories in promoting the communist ideological consciousness of the people and improving the communist moral character of the people!

    This congress shows that our literary and artistic ranks are united solidly. It is united under the literary and artistic guidelines and policies formulated by the Party and Chairman Mao; it is united in the struggle against imperialism, against modern revisionism, and against all kinds of bourgeois ideology. Our unity is a revolutionary unity!

    The scope of our unity is extremely broad. We must strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen the unity with literary and art workers in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and strengthen the unity with all progressive and revolutionary literary and art workers in the world. We fully support the just struggle of all progressive and revolutionary literary and art workers for national liberation, democratic freedom, social progress, and world peace. We must strive to establish a broad united front against the imperialist forces headed by US imperialism!

    Comrades! Let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, implement the spirit of the congress into action, seek truth from facts, and work hard!

    Let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, sing the triumphant song of the era in which the East wind prevails over the West wind, and shape more new heroic images of the proletarian revolutionary era!

    Let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, establish ambitious goals, and create the Mount Everest of socialist literature and art in the history of human culture!

    Long live revolutionary literature and art!

    Long live the Communist Party of China!

    Long live Chairman Mao!

    高唱东风压倒西风的凯歌  塑造更多的革命英雄形象
    郭沫若在全国第三次文代大会上的闭幕词
    新华社13日讯　郭沫若在中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会上的闭幕词。全文如下：
    中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会要宣告闭幕了！
    这一次的大会，是中国文学艺术工作者的祝捷大会，同时也是进一步加强团结、争取更大胜利的誓师大会！
    在这一次大会上，陆定一同志代表党中央和国务院致了祝词，周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和李富春副总理做了国内外形势和有关文学艺术工作的报告。我们敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席和刘少奇主席、宋庆龄副主席、周恩来总理、朱德委员长、邓小平副总理等党和国家的领导人接见了我们全体代表。这一切表示了党对文学艺术事业的无限的关怀，使全体文学艺术工作者都受到了巨大的鼓舞和深刻的教育。
   在这一次大会上，我们对于建国十一年来文学艺术的巨大成就，作了全面的估价。十一年来，我们的文学艺术，反映了我国人民从民主革命到社会主义革命和社会主义建设各个阶段中的斗争生活，描绘和塑造了各个革命阶段、各个战线上所涌现出的许许多多新的英雄人物。我们的文学艺术，反映了我们的政治斗争和生产建设，也促进了我们的政治斗争和生产建设。我们的文学艺术，反映了现实生活，也充满着明天的理想。我们的文学艺术，表现了我国人民蓬勃发展着的共产主义精神，又以这种精神去教育和鼓舞着人民群众。我们的文学艺术，具有强烈的战斗性和鲜明的无产阶级的党性。党和人民对我们的文学艺术事业，给予了高度的评价。陆定一同志代表党中央和国务院所作的祝词中说：“一支以工人阶级的文学艺术工作者为骨干的强大的文学艺术队伍，已经成长起来。”这支队伍“创作了许多思想性和艺术性都很高的、为中国人民所喜闻乐见的优秀作品。”这个估价使我们感到无比的兴奋，同时也使我们认识到取得这些成就的根源。我国文学艺术的巨大成就，完全证明了党对文学艺术事业领导的正确，标志着发展了马克思列宁主义的毛泽东文艺思想的伟大胜利！
    在这一次大会上，我们总结了十一年来文学艺术工作的丰富经验，进一步明确了社会主义文学艺术发展的道路：在为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务的方向下实行百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新。这是发展社会主义文艺的最正确、最宽广的道路。我们说这条道路是最正确的，是由于它引导着我们的文学艺术同无产阶级的政治密切结合，同工农兵的斗争密切结合；引导着文艺工作者日益走向工农化。我们说这条道路是最宽广的，是由于它使各种不同风格、不同流派的创作和表演，群芳竞艳，普遍发展，普遍繁荣。这条道路保证了政治方向的一致性和艺术风格的多样性，解决了文学艺术为谁服务和怎样服务的问题。它既坚决反对阉割马克思列宁主义的现代修正主义，也坚决反对只许一花独放的教条主义。我们遵循着这条道路，在过去的岁月里使我们的文学艺术事业蓬勃地发展了，在今后的岁月里一定会使我们的文学艺术事业更加蓬勃地发展。几十路、几百路、几千路的文艺纵队，将沿着这条道路，坚定步伐、奋勇前进！
    目前的时代是东风压倒西风的时代，是帝国主义日益走向死亡、社会主义日益繁荣昌盛的时代，是世界人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的正义斗争日益蓬勃发展的时代。进步的革命的文学艺术必须充分反映这个伟大的时代，高唱出时代的凯歌，塑造出具有崇高理想的、叱咤风云的革命的英雄形象。为了更好地完成这个任务，我们提倡革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法。这个艺术方法，是毛泽东同志为了使文学艺术能够更好地反映这个英雄时代，根据马克思列宁主义关于不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的思想和文学艺术本身的发展规律，而提出来的。是毛泽东文艺思想的新的结晶。掌握了这个艺术方法，不仅更有利于表现这个新的时代，更有利于吸取文学艺术遗产中的一切优良传统，也更有利于发挥作家艺术家不同的个性和风格。这就给我们的文学艺术开辟了一个无比广阔的天地。
    在这一次大会上，党向我们号召：“我国文学艺术工作的首要任务，就是用文艺的武器，极大地提高全国人民社会主义和共产主义的思想觉悟，提高全国人民共产主义的道德品质。”这是要我们文学艺术工作者具有无产阶级的世界观和共产主义的风格，然后用共产主义的精神去教育人民。为了达到这个目的，我们首先就必须向人民学习，教育者必须先受教育。我们要当好群众的学生，然后才能当好群众的先生。我们必须深入到工农群众中去，使自己工农化，然后才能获得无产阶级的世界观和共产主义的风格。我们必须努力学习马克思列宁主义，努力学习毛主席的著作。我们必须有改造自己的愿望、决心和行动，不断地改造自己的思想。不管是年老的或年青的，也不管是工农出身的或非工农出身的，都必须经常不断地改造自己的思想，使自己成为不断革命的促进派，然后我们的文艺作品才能完成党所交给我们的光荣的任务。
    帝国主义者和现代修正主义者是我们的敌人，又是我们的反面教员。敌人所反对我们做的事情，就正是我们所要做的事情。帝国主义者和现代修正主义者希望我们取消或者放松政治思想领域内的社会主义革命，我们就一定要强调和加强政治思想领域内的社会主义革命。我们必须对资产阶级思想和现代修正主义进行坚决的斗争。我们要用无产阶级的革命的历史唯物论，粉碎资产阶级和现代修正主义者的反动的唯心论。我们要用无产阶级的科学的阶级论，粉碎资产阶级和现代修正主义者的虚伪的人性论。我们要以反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的坚决行动，粉碎现代修正主义者所散布的对于帝国主义的幻想。
    同志们！在过去的岁月里，在党和毛泽东主席的领导下，我们中国的文学艺术工作者跟形形色色的资产阶级思想进行了一系列的斗争，取得了辉煌的胜利，在今后的岁月里，我们一定要更加紧密地团结在党和毛主席的周围，使我们的文学艺术，在促进人民的共产主义的思想觉悟和提高人民的共产主义的道德品质上，取得更加辉煌的胜利！
    这一次大会表明了我们的文学艺术队伍是巩固地团结着的。它是在党和毛主席所规定的文艺方针和文艺政策之下团结起来的；它是在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和反对各种资产阶级思想的斗争中团结起来的。我们的团结是革命的团结！
    我们团结的范围是极其广泛的，我们必须加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，加强与亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的文学艺术工作者之间的团结，加强与世界各国一切进步的、革命的文学艺术工作者之间的团结。我们全力支持一切进步的、革命的文学艺术工作者为争取民族解放、民主自由、社会进步和世界和平的正义斗争。我们要为建立反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义势力的广泛的统一战线而奋斗！
    同志们！让我们更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，把大会的精神贯彻到行动中去，实事求是，埋头苦干！
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，高唱出东风压倒西风的时代凯歌，塑造出更多的无产阶级革命时代的新英雄形象！
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，树雄心，立大志，在人类文化史上，创造出社会主义文学艺术的珠穆朗玛峰！
    革命的文学艺术万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
