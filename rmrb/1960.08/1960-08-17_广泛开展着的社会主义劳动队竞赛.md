    Widespread Socialist Labor Emulation Drive
    Hai Leng, Xiao Feng, Yuan Yu
    The "Secret" of Outstanding Achievements
    On the eve of the "May Day" International Labor Day, we visited the famous Csepel Iron and Steel United Works in Budapest. In the eighteen production units of this enterprise, 74% of the employees participated in the socialist labor emulation drive, and 2,500 labor teams are working hard to achieve the competition targets ahead of schedule.
    In 1959, the Csepel Iron and Steel United Works overfulfilled the state plan by 6.1% and was rated as one of the national red flag units by the Council of Ministers and the Central Council of Trade Unions.
    The deputy general manager, Heji Feiremuci, who accompanied us on the visit, has worked here for twenty-three years and has visited China twice. When introducing the overfulfillment of the first quarter production plan of the United Works this year, he particularly pointed out the huge figure of 33 million forints exceeding the export product plan. The "export products" mentioned here are mainly seamless steel pipe equipment and fertilizer equipment manufactured for China. Because the semi-finished products were prepared before the new year, the quality of the castings was good, and the employees launched a vigorous socialist labor emulation drive, they completed the first half of the year's production plan for export to China ahead of schedule on April 10.
    The socialist labor emulation drive of the Csepel Iron and Steel United Works is a microcosm of the rising socialist labor emulation drive of the Hungarian working people. In the labor emulation drive, Hungarian workers often consider how to improve their work, make it more rational and economical, and accelerate socialist construction with full enthusiasm in their posts.
    Borgnol Gyurge, a young steelmaking worker at the Danube Iron and Steel Plant, after his father was tragically killed by counter-revolutionaries in 1956, his class hatred and sense of responsibility for building socialism made this sixteen-year-old youth resolutely inherit his father's business and become a steelmaking worker. Not long ago, Gyurge had just finished his primary school courses, and actively participated in the technical training classes held in the factory, so that his cultural and technical level has been continuously improved. Therefore, in the few years after entering the factory, he has overfulfilled the production plan every year, with the highest in 1959 exceeding the original target by 25%.
    The factories and enterprises in Miskolc and Kazincbarcika cities, on the basis of saving more than 80 million forints for the country last year, have put forward new goals in this year's labor emulation drive. The Gyursh Laszlo labor team of the Borsod Power Station not only guaranteed the timely supply of coal for boilers, but also repaired the 240-meter-long conveyor belt ahead of schedule, saving the country tens of thousands of forints.
    Through the socialist labor emulation drive centered on increasing production and practicing economy, Hungary completed the three-year national economic plan one year ahead of schedule. At the end of 1959, the most important indicators of industrial production reached the level of the end of 1960. For the same reason, in the first quarter of this year, various industrial enterprises increased production by 80,000 tons of petroleum, 53,000 tons of steel, 32,000 tons of bituminous coal and 6 million square meters of cotton textiles for the country....
    When summarizing the achievements of the socialist labor emulation drive, Comrade Szurdi István, member of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Minister of the Industrial Department of the Central Committee of the Party, pointed out: They did not adopt any special methods. They decided on the goals of the socialist labor emulation drive according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and carried them out to the end. ... The "secret" of their outstanding achievements lies in the wholeheartedness and mutual assistance of the leaders and employees, and in their hard work and arduous struggle for the collective cause of the whole people.
    Two Periods of Labor Emulation
    On March 30 this year, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party decided to award the "Red Flag of the Party Congress" to nine units, including the Budapest Red Star Tractor Factory and the Tiszacsege State Farm, which launched a socialist labor emulation drive to welcome the Seventh Congress of the Party; the Danube River Basin Coal Mine United Enterprise and the Polgárdi Agricultural Machinery Station and other eighteen units received the "Party Congress Certificate of Merit." Within various industrial enterprises, there are even tens of thousands of units and individuals who have received spiritual and material rewards in the labor emulation drive.
    When people sum up the achievements of the socialist labor emulation drive to welcome the Party Congress, they are more determined to carry out the labor emulation drive. After the counter-revolutionary riots in 1956, due to the enemy's rumors and sabotage, and the influence of revisionist views, the socialist labor emulation drive once stagnated. In the past few years, the Party has patiently carried out propaganda and education work, exposed the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and revisionist elements, gradually improved the political consciousness of the broad masses of workers, strengthened the sense of responsibility for socialist construction, and the enthusiasm for labor has also been unprecedentedly high. Therefore, when the Central Committee of the Party issued the great call to complete the three-year plan one year ahead of schedule on March 6, 1959, the socialist labor emulation drive quickly spread throughout the country and quickly developed into an active and vibrant mass movement. This is the first period of the socialist labor emulation drive launched by the Hungarian working class.
    The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party held in January 1960 again called on all production units to further carry out labor emulation drives to welcome the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the motherland, and formulate annual plans for increasing production and practicing economy; and actively develop socialist labor teams. In this way, the second period of the labor emulation drive to welcome the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Hungary quickly developed into a full-year comprehensive competition, and all employees devoted themselves to the intense battle to overfulfill the 1960 economic development plan and prepare a good starting point for the second five-year plan.
    The annual production increase and economy competition targets formulated by the more than 39,000 labor teams in the national industrial and transportation departments include considerable production tasks. For example, the miners of the Komló Coal Mine decided to increase production by more than 30,000 tons of high-quality coal in one year and save 60,000 forints of funds; in addition to increasing production by 110,000 tons of iron and 100,000 tons of steel, the employees of the Danube Iron and Steel Plant also guaranteed that the hot rolling mill would be put into production ahead of schedule.
    The task put forward by the employees of the chemical industry sector to present gifts to the National Day is: to overfulfill the annual plan by 2.8%, and the labor productivity will also be increased by 2.8% than the original target, and the production cost will be reduced by 0.8% than the original level. These seemingly small figures mean that in the heroic labor of the employees of various chemical departments, industrial products such as medicines, dyes, fertilizers and aluminum with a value of 380 million forints will be produced for the country.
    The labor emulation drive to welcome the 15th anniversary of the liberation has achieved remarkable results from the beginning. In January and February, the pharmaceutical industry exceeded the plan by 5.6%, the heavy chemical industry exceeded the plan by 3.3%, and the organic chemical industry exceeded the plan by 2.6%.
    On the basis of overproducing 400 tons of metallurgical products in the first two days of the new year, the employees of the Lenin Metallurgical United Enterprise continued to work hard and completed the task of presenting gifts to the National Day ten days ahead of schedule, and increased production by 5,000 tons of steel and other metallurgical products worth 12 million forints in two and a half months.
    New Factors in Labor Emulation
    The emergence of a new factor in the Hungarian socialist labor emulation drive—the socialist labor team—has received universal attention from the Party, the government, and enterprise leaders.
    The steel pipe factory of the Csepel Iron and Steel United Works in Budapest has a Dore labor team specializing in electric welding production. In June last year, the thirteen members of this labor team first set off a socialist labor emulation drive in the country. In the second, third, and fourth quarters of last year, they overfulfilled the state production plan by 10% to 15%, eliminated the phenomenon of absenteeism without cause, and did a very good job in shift handover... and thus obtained the title of socialist labor team. Among the sixty-eight labor teams participating in the same competition in the steel pipe factory, the Peace, Forward, and Oberlei and other seven labor teams also won the glorious title together with the Dore team. Now, they are advancing victoriously. The 1960 production increase and economy competition conditions of the Dore team are: to overfulfill the state plan by 3% every quarter; to reduce the scrap rate by 6% compared with 1959; to increase the welding rate of each pair of welding rods by 5%; to collectively train four skilled workers who can master electric welding technology; to regularly participate in political studies and make up for primary, secondary and university courses according to different situations. In the first quarter of this year, they successfully completed all the tasks stipulated in the plan.
    In the socialist labor emulation drive, the socialist labor team has made great progress. By mid-April, the number of socialist labor teams in Hungary had increased from more than 4,400 at the beginning of the year to more than 12,000. In each factory and enterprise, there are several and dozens of such worker collectives fighting for the title of socialist labor team. Facts have shown that these worker collectives are playing an increasingly important role in the labor emulation drive, which fully embodies the new socialist spirit of collective responsibility for individuals and individual responsibility for the collective.
    We have visited many members of the "Socialist Labor Team", and they all particularly emphasized political unity and mutual assistance in thinking. Suoerga Ashegemu, the captain of the labor team of the motorcycle manufacturing factory of the Csepel Iron and Steel United Works, said well: "In socialist labor, the most important thing between people is ideological unity." In order to strengthen the close unity between team members and between families, Ashegemu and his companions completed the plan for collective outings ahead of schedule. Through collective reading of newspapers, watching operas together, and studying together, everyone's political awareness has been improved, and the feelings have become more harmonious. However, this kind of unity is not without principles, and they have carried out serious criticism and self-criticism for everyone's mistakes and shortcomings.
    Flowers of Innovation Bloom Everywhere
    As an important part of the socialist labor emulation drive, the technical innovation movement has also greatly developed with the deepening of the labor emulation drive. As Emil Tashnadi, Director of the National Bureau of Inventions of Hungary, said, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees in Hungary in the technical innovation and invention movement has become an important factor in improving the technical level, which has greatly promoted the development of the national economy. According to statistics, in the first half of 1959, employees across the country put forward 106,000 technical innovation proposals and more than 500 inventions with great significance. In the second half of the year, the absolute number of the two items increased to 250,000. Among them, the economic value of 85,000 technical innovations that have been adopted has exceeded 3 billion forints.
    Now, under the encouragement of the glorious task that this year's industrial production plan will increase by 10% compared with the 1960 target originally set in the three-year plan, the broad masses of employees in Hungary are carrying out technical innovation and invention movements more deeply and extensively, striving to complete one-half of the production growth through the improvement of labor productivity.
    In the Csepel Iron and Steel United Works in Budapest, we visited the production process of drilling seamless steel pipes with hollow drilling machines. Because the hollow drill bit is easy to cool after drilling, its service time is prolonged and the production efficiency is improved. In the past, 35.1 kg of drilling steel was consumed for each ton of steel pipe rolled, but now only 6 to 8 kg is enough; in the past, more than 40 holes were drilled per hour, but now it has been increased to about 250. At that time, Comrade Feiremuci happily said: "We also used this hollow drill bit in the seamless steel pipe equipment produced for China."
    The sleeve sewing machine designed jointly by Engineer Sape Shandor and technicians of the Szeged Garment Factory, although it looks like an ordinary sewing machine, its special device can uniquely replace the manual sewing of sleeves. The work is even and beautiful, the time is shortened by one-third, and the efficiency is increased by 33%. Among the 5,000 innovation proposals and inventions put forward by the employees of the textile factory, one engineer created a new type of sewing machine that can sew 2,800 stitches per minute and can also cut the sewn edges neatly. After a textile factory adopted this machine, the total value of savings in half a year reached 200,000 forints.
    On the eve of the National Day, various industrial enterprises in Hungary held technical innovation months and various exhibitions, and also held technical innovation conferences. The employees of the No. 24 Automobile Transportation Company in Komló, the coal capital, put forward twenty-two valuable technical innovation proposals in the "Technical Innovation Month" that started on March 7; the state-owned Construction Industry Corporation specially established a "Technical Club" to help employees make inventions. In the first ten days after the start of the "Innovation Month" at the Budapest United Bulb Factory, the employees put forward more than 100 innovation proposals; one innovation proposal that has been put into production can save 210,000 cubic meters of gas every year.
    The reason why the flowers of technical innovation in Hungary can bloom everywhere is mainly because the employees have greatly promoted the spirit of mutual cooperation and close collaboration. The employees of the Csepel Iron and Steel United Works have also set an example in this regard. The employees of the automobile factory of this enterprise not only carried out innovation themselves, but also spent 300 hours of voluntary labor time to design a set of automatic control units for the wood cutting assembly workshop, helping them greatly reduce physical labor and improve production. The members of the Joseph Labor Team of the Steel Pipe Factory took the initiative to teach the new method of cutting steel pipe tails to the Shagfari Labor Team, jointly saving tools and raw materials for the country.
    The construction enterprises, iron foundries and machinery factories in Nógrád County cooperated closely and supported each other, ensuring that a newly built glass factory in this state was put into production ahead of schedule. In the Kebania Porcelain Factory, technicians and workers also made amazing achievements: they jointly transformed unusable old machine tools into new cutting machine tools. After this machine tool was put into production, the production of high-voltage porcelain insulators was tripled compared with the past, and the quality of the insulators was improved.
    Now, the Hungarian trade union and the Ministry of Heavy Industry are doing their best to organize and lead the work of technical innovation, emphasizing technical innovation as the central task of carrying out labor emulation. The National Bureau of Inventions requires all factories and enterprises to analyze the production and operation process according to the actual situation of their units and with reference to the world's most advanced production level, formulate plans for technical innovation and equipment, and concentrate their efforts on solving key problems and important links. According to these requirements, various factories and enterprises have formulated new specific plans for technical innovation. It can be expected that the planning and purposefulness of the technical innovation movement of Hungarian factories and enterprises will be stronger, the effect will be greater, and it will more effectively promote the in-depth development of the socialist labor emulation drive.

    广泛开展着的社会主义劳动队竞赛
    海棱　萧风　袁毓
    杰出成绩的“秘密”
    “五一”国际劳动节前夕，我们访问了著名的布达佩斯切佩尔钢铁联合企业。在这个企业的十八个生产单位里，74％的职工参加了社会主义劳动竞赛，有二千五百个劳动队正为提前实现竞赛指标而紧张地劳动着。
    1959年，切佩尔钢铁联合企业超额6.1％完成了国家计划，被部长会议和工会中央理事会评为全国的红旗单位之一。
    陪同我们访问的副总厂长赫吉·费热木茨是在这里工作了二十三年的老工人，曾两次访问中国。他在介绍联合企业超额完成今年第一季度生产计划的情况时，特别指出出口产品计划超额三千三百万福林的巨大数字。这里所说的“出口产品”，主要是为中国制造的无缝钢管设备和化肥设备。由于半成品在年前就做好了准备，铸件质量良好，和职工群众开展了热火朝天的社会主义劳动竞赛，他们在4月10日就提前完成了对中国出口的上半年的生产计划。
    切佩尔钢铁联合企业的社会主义劳动竞赛，是匈牙利劳动人民社会主义劳动竞赛日益高涨的缩影。在劳动竞赛中，匈牙利的工人们，经常考虑的是如何改进工作，使工作更合理、更经济，干劲十足地在自己的岗位上加速社会主义建设。
    多瑙钢铁厂的青年炼钢工人保格诺尔·久尔盖，当1956年他的父亲惨遭反革命分子杀害后，阶级仇恨和建设社会主义的责任感，使这个才到十六岁的青年人毅然继承父业，当了炼钢工人。不久前，久尔盖刚念完了小学课程，又积极参加了厂内举办的技术训练班，使文化技术水平不断得到提高。因此，他在进厂后的几年中，年年超额完成生产计划，最高的1959年超过原订指标的25％。
    密什柯尔兹市和卡新茨巴尔齐卡城的工厂企业，在去年为国家节约资金八千多万福林的基础上，今年的劳动竞赛又提出了新的奋斗目标。波尔索德发电站的久尔什·拉斯洛劳动队，不仅保证了锅炉用煤的及时供应，还提前修好了二百四十米长的传送带，为国家节约了几万福林。
    通过以增产节约为中心的社会主义劳动竞赛，匈牙利提前一年完成了三年国民经济计划。1959年底，工业生产最主要的指标达到了1960年末的水平。由于同样的原因，各工业企业在今年的第一季度内，为国家增产了八万吨石油、五万三千吨钢、三万二千吨黑煤和六百万平方米的棉织品……。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员、党中央工业部部长苏尔蒂·伊斯特万同志总结社会主义劳动竞赛的成就时指出：他们并没有采用什么特殊的方法，他们根据党中央的指示决定了社会主义劳动竞赛的目标，并把它们贯彻到底。……他们取得杰出成绩的“秘密”，在于领导人员和职工们全心全意，互相帮助，在于他们为了全民集体事业而埋头苦干，艰苦奋斗。
    劳动竞赛的两个时期
    今年3月30日，匈牙利社会主义工人党决定：授予迎接党的第七次代表大会而开展社会主义劳动竞赛的布达佩斯红星拖拉机工厂、蒂萨赛恩提姆雷国营农场等九个单位以“党代表大会红旗”；多瑙河流域煤矿联合企业和波耳加尔德农业机器站等十八个单位得到了“党代表大会奖状”。各工业企业内部，在劳动竞赛中得到精神和物质奖励的单位和个人，更以千万计。
    当人们总结为迎接党代表大会而开展的社会主义劳动竞赛的成就时，更坚定了开展劳动竞赛的决心。在1956年反革命暴乱后，由于敌人的造谣破坏、修正主义观点的影响，社会主义劳动竞赛曾一度陷于停顿。几年来，党耐心地进行宣传教育工作，揭穿了帝国主义和修正主义分子的阴谋和诡计，逐步提高了广大劳动群众的政治觉悟，加强了社会主义建设的责任感，劳动积极性也空前高涨起来。因此，当党中央委员会在1959年3月6日发出提前一年完成三年计划的伟大号召后，社会主义劳动竞赛便迅速地在全国各地普遍展开，很快发展成为一个活跃的、充满生命力的群众性的运动。这是匈牙利工人阶级开展社会主义劳动竞赛的第一个时期。
    1960年1月召开的匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会全体会议，又号召各生产单位为迎接祖国解放十五周年而进一步开展劳动竞赛，制订全年的增产节约计划；并积极发展社会主义劳动队。这样，为迎接匈牙利解放十五周年而开展的第二个时期的劳动竞赛，很快便发展成为全年的全面的竞赛，全体职工为超额完成1960年的经济发展计划，为第二个五年计划准备良好的起点，投入了紧张的战斗。
    全国工业和交通部门的三万九千多个劳动队制订的全年增产节约的竞赛目标中，包括相当高的生产任务。例如柯姆洛煤矿矿工决定一年增产三万多吨优质煤，节约六万福林资金；多瑙钢铁厂职工除增产十一万吨铁和十万吨钢外，还保证热轧钢厂提前投入生产。
    化学工业部门的职工们提出向国庆献礼的任务是：要超额2.8％完成年度计划，劳动生产率也将比原订指标提高2.8％，生产成本将比原订水平降低0.8％。这些看来不大的数字，却意味着在各化学部门职工的英勇劳动中，将为国家增产价值三亿八千万福林的医药、染料、化肥和铝等工业品。
    迎接解放十五周年的劳动竞赛一开始就取得了显著成绩。1、2月份内，医药工业超过计划的5.6％，重化学工业超计划3.3％，有机化学工业超计划2.6％。
    列宁冶金联合企业的职工，在新年头两天超额生产四百吨冶金产品的基础上，继续鼓足干劲，提前十天完成了向国庆献礼的任务，两个半月内共增产了五千吨钢和价值一千二百万福林的其他冶金产品。
    劳动竞赛的新因素
    匈牙利社会主义劳动竞赛中的新因素——社会主义劳动队的出现，受到了党、政府和企业领导的普遍重视。
    布达佩斯切佩尔钢铁联合企业的钢管厂，有一个专管电焊生产的多热劳动队。去年6月，这个劳动队的十三个成员，第一次在全国范围内掀起了社会主义劳动竞赛。在去年二、三、四三个季度中，他们超额10％到15％完成了国家生产计划，消灭了无故缺勤的现象，交接班的工作做得非常好……从而取得社会主义劳动队的称号。在钢管厂参加同一竞赛的六十八个劳动队中，与多热队一起获得光荣称号的还有和平、前进、奥伯雷都等七个劳动队。现在，他们正在乘胜前进。多热队的1960年增产节约的竞赛条件是：每个季度要超额3％完成国家计划；废品率比1959年降低6％；每对焊条的焊接率要提高5％；集体培育四个能掌握电焊技术的技术工人；经常参加政治学习，并根据不同情况分别补习小学、中学和大学的课程。今年第一季度内，凡是计划规定的任务，他们都胜利地完成了。
    在社会主义劳动竞赛中，社会主义劳动队有了很大的发展。到4月中，匈牙利的社会主义劳动队已由年初的四千四百多个发展到一万二千多个。在每个工厂和企业里，都有几个和几十个这样的工人集体，在为争取社会主义劳动队的称号而斗争。事实表明，这些工人集体在劳动竞赛中所起的作用越来越大，它充分地体现了集体对个人负责，个人对集体负责的社会主义的新精神。
    我们访问过许多“社会主义劳动队”的成员，他们都特别强调政治上的团结一致，思想上的互相帮助。切佩尔钢铁联合企业的摩托车制造工厂的苏奥尔加·阿舍格木劳动队队长说得好：“在社会主义的劳动中，人与人之间最重要的东西是思想上的一致”。为了加紧队员与队员、家庭与家庭的亲密团结，阿舍格木和他的同伴们提前完成了集体野游的计划。通过集体读报，一道看戏，共同学习，大家的政治觉悟提高了，感情更融洽了。但是，这种团结并不是没有原则的，对于每个人的错误和缺点，他们都进行了严肃的批评和自我批评。
    革新花朵遍地开
    作为社会主义劳动竞赛的一个重要组成部分的技术革新运动，随着劳动竞赛的深入开展也大大地发展了。正如匈牙利全国创造发明局局长塔什纳迪·埃米尔所说，匈牙利全国广大职工在技术革新和创造发明运动中的积极性已经成为提高技术水平的重要因素，它大大促进了国民经济的发展。据统计，1959年上半年全国职工提出了十万六千项技术革新建议和五百多件具有重大意义的发明创造，下半年两项合计的绝对数字就增加到二十五万项。其中经过采用的八万五千项技术革新的经济价值已经超过了三十亿福林。
    现在，匈牙利的广大职工群众，在今年的工业生产计划将比三年计划原订1960年的指标增加10％的光荣任务的鼓舞下，更加深入广泛地开展技术革新和创造发明运动，力争使生产增长的二分之一通过劳动生产率的提高来完成。
    在布达佩斯切佩尔钢铁联合企业中，我们参观了空心钻孔机钻轧无缝钢管的生产过程。由于这种空心钻头钻孔后易于冷却，它的使用时间延长了，生产效率提高了。过去每轧一吨钢管消耗钻钢三十五点一公斤，现在只要六到八公斤就够了；过去每小时钻孔四十多根，现在提高到二百五十根左右。当时，费热木茨同志高兴地说：“我们为中国生产的无缝钢管设备中，也使用了这种空心钻头。”
    赛格德服装工厂的萨陂·山道尔工程师和技术员共同设计的缝衣袖的机器，虽然形状很像普通的缝纫机，但它的特殊装置却能独特地代替手工缝绱衣袖，活路匀净好看，时间缩短三分之一，效率提高33％。在纺织工厂职工提出的五千项革新建议和发明中，其中有一位工程师创造的新式缝纫机每分钟可缝二千八百针，同时还可以把缝过的布边剪齐。有一个纺织厂采用这种机器后，半年节约的总价值达二十万福林。
    国庆前夕，匈牙利各工业企业都举办了技术革新月和各种展览会，并且举行了技术革新会议。煤都柯姆洛的第24号汽车运输公司的职工，在从3月7日开始的“技术革新月”中，提出了很有价值的技术革新建议二十二件；国营建筑工业公司专门建立了一个“技术俱乐部”，来帮助职工大闹创造发明。布达佩斯联合灯泡厂在“革新月”开始后的头十天，职工们就提出了一百多项革新建议；已投入生产的一项革新建议，每年可以节约二十一万立方米的煤气。
    匈牙利技术革新之花所以能够遍地开放，主要是职工群众大大发扬了互相配合，密切协作的精神。切佩尔钢铁联合企业的职工在这方面也做出了榜样。这个企业汽车厂的职工不仅自己搞革新，还花了三百个小时的义务劳动时间，为切削木料装配车间设计了一套自动控制机组，帮助他们大大减轻了体力劳动和提高了生产。钢管厂约瑟夫劳动队的队员们，主动地把新的切钢管尾巴的方法教给了夏格伐里劳动队，共同为国家节约刀具和原料。
    诺格拉德州的建筑企业、铸铁厂和机械厂密切合作，互相支援，保证了这个州的一个新建玻璃厂提前投入生产。在克巴尼亚瓷器厂，技术人员和工人也做出了惊人的成绩：他们共同把不能用的旧机床改造成新型的切削机床。这部机床投入生产后，使高电压的瓷器绝缘体的生产比过去提高了三倍，并且改进了绝缘体的质量。
    现在，匈牙利工会和重工业部正尽力组织和领导技术革新的工作，把技术革新强调为进行劳动竞赛的中心任务。全国创造发明局要求各工厂企业根据本单位的实际情况并参照世界最先进的生产水平来分析生产和操作过程，制定技术革新和设备的计划，集中精力解决关键性的问题和重要环节。根据这些要求，各工厂企业都已制定新的技术革新的具体规划。可以预期，匈牙利工厂企业的技术革新运动的计划性和目的性将会更强，效果也将更大，并将更有效地推进社会主义劳动竞赛的深入发展。
