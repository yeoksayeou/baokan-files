Participating in Agricultural Labor, Participating in Agricultural Planning
Tie Mu Factory of Gucheng Commune Arranges Production Early Based on Agricultural Needs
Adopts "Four Combinations" and "Five Guarantees" Methods to be Fully Responsible for the Manufacturing, Reform, Use, Repair, and Maintenance of Agricultural Machinery
This newspaper reports: The Tie Mu (Iron and Wood) Factory of Gucheng Commune in Jiaohe County, Hebei Province, under the guidance of the ideology of taking agriculture as the foundation, adopts the methods of "Two Participations," "Four Combinations," and "Five Guarantees" to organize employees to participate in agricultural production, deeply understand agricultural needs, and serve agricultural production deeply and comprehensively.

Participating in Agricultural Production to Deeply Understand Agricultural Needs
The "Two Participations" method means that factory cadres and workers regularly participate in agricultural production labor and participate in the formulation of agricultural production plans, so that the commune-run industry and agricultural production are closely integrated. They participate in agricultural production in two ways: One is to organize a group of people to regularly participate in agricultural labor or work with production teams to engage in "experimental fields," thereby participating in every production link from planting, management, harvesting to threshing, so as to fully understand the cultivation and growth of various crops and better reform and manufacture suitable farm tools; the other is, according to the spirit of being engaged in agriculture during busy farming seasons and working during slack seasons, more people are organized to support agricultural production during busy farming seasons. As a result of all factory employees regularly participating in agricultural labor, they can more comprehensively understand the needs of agricultural production, making the factory's production and agricultural needs more closely integrated.

The cadres and workers of this factory also participate in the work of formulating agricultural production plans. The factory's two directors and deputy secretary of the Party branch respectively led technicians to the production teams that produce grain, cotton, and grain-cotton mixed crops to participate in the formulation of agricultural plans. This enables them to prepare materials and produce in advance according to agricultural needs, and timely supply the needs of agricultural production.

In order to make the products produced by the factory suitable for agricultural production, this factory also adopted the "Four Combinations" method for the manufacturing of agricultural tools, that is, cadres and workers combined with experienced farmers and skilled craftsmen in rural areas to jointly research and manufacture. Shen Qingxi, the deputy director of this factory, and technician Fu Fengzao participated in labor in Shizhuang Production Team. Seeing that sowing cotton took up a lot of labor and had low work efficiency, they worked with experienced farmer Shi Yongquan and skilled craftsman Zhang Wenzhong to jointly research and manufacture a new-style sowing drill. Through "Two Participations" and "Four Combinations," they reformed 31 kinds of tools, including sowing drills, five-legged weeding hoes, fertilizer application vehicles, threshing machines, and well-drilling cones, totaling 2,760 pieces, making each one suitable and welcomed by the majority of commune members.

Implement the "Five Guarantees" System
To Serve Agriculture to the End
In the spirit of serving agriculture to the end, this factory has implemented the "Five Guarantees" for the manufacturing, reform, use, repair, and maintenance of agricultural machinery, that is, the factory is fully responsible for these five aspects. Their specific practices are:

(1) Whenever a new type of tool is trial-produced, the workers first carry it to the production team to perform operating techniques. After being appraised by the masses and modified according to the opinions of the masses, it is then promoted and manufactured.

(2) Impart the operation and repair techniques of new agricultural tools and help production teams train various technical talents. There are three methods: First, hold short-term training classes to organize farmers to come to the factory to learn; second, establish two technical training stations in the entire commune, with technicians sent by the factory to the station every five days to teach the use and repair techniques of agricultural machinery and tools; third, on-site consultation, organize learning on the spot. For example, after the well-drilling cone was manufactured, cadres of various production teams and some well-drilling commune members were organized to participate in on-site practice. Thirteen people from Fuzhuang Production Team came and learned the operating techniques after one day of on-site practice, and the next day they put them into well-drilling activities. Through the above three methods, this factory has so far helped the commune train 278 agricultural machinery drivers, new agricultural tool operators, and agricultural machinery and tool administrators, enabling all 131 skilled craftsmen in the commune to learn how to repair power machinery; 69 semi-skilled drivers who only knew how to drive but not repair have reached the level of being able to disassemble, install, and repair; and 78 farmers without culture have also become operators of new agricultural tools.

(3) The factory sent workers to contract specific areas to help production teams establish systems for inspection, repair, maintenance, and storage of agricultural machinery and tools, and also helped establish agricultural machinery and tool storage warehouses and formulate operating procedures. After doing this, machine accidents were reduced, operation became normal, and tasks were completed faster.

(4) Helped management areas and production teams establish 59 agricultural tool repair stations and groups, realizing the requirements of commune-owned factories, area-owned stations, and team-owned groups, forming an agricultural machinery repair network throughout the commune.

(5) Reform and manufacture agricultural tools, striving to be ahead of each season and proactive in everything. Whatever tools are needed for agricultural production, manufacture them.

Support Agriculture and Develop Industry
Factory cadres and workers participate in agricultural labor and participate in the formulation of agricultural production plans. The work becomes more practical and meticulous, and the understanding of agricultural production needs and farmer requirements becomes clearer and clearer, so that industrial production is ahead of each season and proactive in everything, with planned production and adaptation to agricultural seasons. When the factory is idle, it rushes to manufacture the agricultural tools needed for the next season; during busy farming seasons, it can free up hands and feet and draw out most of its manpower to directly support the commune in rushing to harvest and plant. For example, this year the factory manufactured a batch of suitable wheat threshing machines in advance. During the wheat harvest, the factory organized 163 people to help Gucheng Production Team rush to harvest wheat, and at the same time used threshing machines to support various production teams in threshing. In seven days, all more than 40,000 mu of wheat in the entire commune were harvested and put into storage, more than 20 days faster than last year. Their actions have been well received by the commune members, who said: "The workers are not only the vanguard of industrial production, but also the shock force of agricultural production."

Because this factory has firmly established the idea of serving agriculture, starting from agriculture in everything, thinking about agriculture everywhere, and doing everything possible to innovate technology to meet the needs of agricultural production, the variety of products has continued to increase and the output value has gradually increased. As of now, this factory has as many as 42 kinds of products, 12 kinds more than in 1959, and has manufactured more than 50,000 pieces of various production tools. The output value from March to June this year has increased by more than four times compared with the same period last year. Profits have also increased. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has allocated a portion of its profits to purchase gas engines, gasoline engines, and shaping machines; coupled with large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution campaigns, workers in the baking furnace have been freed from heavy physical labor and realized semi-mechanization; electric saws, electric chisels, and electric planers have been installed in the carpentry workshop; and power blowers and sand-rolling power mills have been installed in the foundry workshop.

    参加农业劳动　参与农业规划
    古城公社铁木厂根据农业需要及早安排生产
    采用“四结合”“五包”办法，对农业机具的制造、改革、使用、修配、保养负责到底
    本报讯　河北省交河县古城公社铁木厂，在以农业为基础的思想指导下，采取“两参”、“四结合”、“五包”的方法，组织职工参加农业生产，深入了解农业的需要，深入地、全面地为农业生产服务。
    参加农业生产  深知农业需要
    实行“两参”的方法，就是由工厂的干部、工人定期参加农业生产劳动，参加制定农业生产规划，使社办工业和农业生产密切结合起来。他们参加农业生产有两种办法：一种是组织一部分人员，经常参加农业劳动或者和生产队结合搞“试验田”，从而对每种作物从种植、管理、收割到打轧等各个生产环节都参加到底，以便全面了解各种作物的耕作和生长情况，更好地改革、制造适用的农具；另一种是，根据农忙务农、农闲作工的精神，农忙的时候，就组织更多的人员支援农业生产。全厂职工经常参加农业劳动的结果，就能够比较全面地了解农业生产的需要，使工厂的生产和农业上的需要更紧密地结合起来。
    这个厂的干部、工人还参与制定农业生产规划的工作。工厂的二位厂长和党支部副书记分别带领技术工人，深入产粮、产棉和粮棉杂作的生产队，参与制订农业规划。这样能根据农业需要，提前备料，提前生产，能够及时供应农业生产的需要。
    为了使工厂生产的产品适用于农业生产，这个厂对农具的制造还采取了“四结合”的办法，即由干部、工人结合老农和农村中的能工巧匠，一块研究制造。这个厂副厂长沈庆西和技术工人傅凤藻在史庄生产队参加劳动，看到播种棉花占用劳力很多，工效很低，就和老农史永全、能工巧匠张文仲共同研究，制造出新式播种耧。通过“两参”、“四结合”，改革了播种耧、五腿耘锄、追肥车、脱粒机、打井锥等三十一种工具，共二千七百六十件，做到件件适用，受到广大社员的欢迎。
    实行“五包”制度
    为农业服务到底
    这个厂本着为农业服务到底的精神，对农业机具的制造、改革、使用、修配、保养实行了“五包”，即在这五个方面由工厂一包到底。他们的具体做法是：
    （一）每当一件新式工具试制出来以后，先由工人携带到生产队进行操作技术表演，经过群众鉴定、按群众意见修改后，再推广制造。
    （二）传授新农具的操作、修理技术，帮助生产队培养各种技术人材。方法有三种：一是举办短期训练班，组织农民到工厂来学习；二是在全社建立了两个技术传授站，由工厂派出技术工人，每五天上站传授一次农械、农具的使用、修理技术；三是现场会诊，就地组织学习。如打井锥制造出来以后，就组织各生产队干部和部分打井社员来现场参加实习。傅庄生产队来了十三个人，现场实习一天就都学会了操作技术，第二天就投入打井活动。这个厂通过以上三种办法，到目前共帮助公社培训出农业机械司机手、新式农具手、农械农具管理员二百七十八人，使全社一百三十一名能工巧匠都学会了修理动力机械；六十九名只会开不会修的半熟练司机手，达到了会拆卸、会安装、会修理的水平；七十八名没有文化的农民也成了新式农具的操作手。
    （三）工厂派出工人，分片包干，帮助生产队建立了农业机具的检修、保养、保管等制度，还帮助建立了农业机具保管仓库，制订了操作规程等。这样作了以后，机器的事故减少了，运转正常了，完成任务快了。
    （四）帮助管理区、生产队建立了五十九个农具修配站、组，实现了社有厂、区有站、队有组的要求，在全社范围内形成了一个农业机具修配网。
    （五）改革和制造农具，作到季季赶前，事事主动。农业生产需要什么工具，就制造什么。
    支援了农业  发展了工业
    工厂干部、工人参加农业劳动、参加制定农业生产规划，工作越来越踏实、细致，了解农业生产需要和农民要求越来越清楚，因而使工业生产季季赶前，事事主动，生产有计划，适应农时。工厂在农闲的时候，就把下一个季节需要的农具赶制出来了；在农忙的时候就可以腾出手脚，抽出大部人力直接支援公社抢收、抢种。例如这个厂今年事先就制造出一批适用的小麦脱粒机，在麦收的时候，工厂组织了一百六十三人，帮助古城生产队抢收小麦，同时用脱粒机支援各生产队脱粒，七天的时间就把全公社四万多亩小麦全部收打入仓，比去年快了二十多天。他们这样做，得到了社员们的好评，社员们说：“工人既是工业生产上的先锋队，又是农业生产上的突击队”。
    这个厂由于坚定地树立了为农业服务的思想，一切从农业出发，处处为农业着想，千方百计革新技术，满足农业生产的需要，因而产品品种不断增加，产值逐步上升。截至目前，这个厂产品已经达到四十二种之多，比1959年增加了十二种，制造各种生产工具达五万多件，今年3至6月份产值比去年同期增长了四倍多。利润也有增加，今年以来，这厂从利润中拨出一部分款购买了煤气机、汽油机和牛头刨等设备；加上大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，使烘炉工人摆脱了笨重的体力劳动，实现了半机械化；木工车间安上了电锯、电凿、电刨子；翻砂车间安上了动力鼓风机、轧砂动力碾。
