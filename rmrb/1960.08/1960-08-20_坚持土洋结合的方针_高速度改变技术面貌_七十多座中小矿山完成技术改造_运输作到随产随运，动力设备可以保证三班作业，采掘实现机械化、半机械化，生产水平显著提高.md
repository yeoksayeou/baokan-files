    Adhere to the Policy of Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods to Rapidly Change the Technical Landscape
    More Than Seventy Small and Medium-Sized Mines Complete Technical Transformation
    Transportation Achieves On-Demand Transport, Power Equipment Can Guarantee Three-Shift Operation, Mining and Excavation Realize Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization, Significantly Improving Production Levels
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the technical transformation work of small and medium-sized ferrous metal mines across the country has achieved remarkable results. According to recent statistics from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, more than seventy mines have completed technical transformation. The production level and scale of these mines have reached the design requirements; internal and external mine transportation has been mechanized and semi-mechanized, ensuring that the amount mined is the amount transported; sufficient power is available for three-shift operation day and night; and manual rock drilling and shoulder carrying in lifting and transportation have been eliminated. More than one hundred mines have built more than one thousand kilometers of small foreign railways and small indigenous railways for ore transportation.
    The technical transformation of small and medium-sized mines began in the spring of this year. Small and medium-sized mines are the main raw material base for small and medium-sized iron and steel enterprises, and this year they bear the glorious task of producing more than half of the country's total ore output.
    According to the experience of Shandong, Hebei, Liaoning, Jiangxi, Hunan, and other provinces, the main links in the technical transformation of small and medium-sized mines are, first, to solve the problem of transportation inside and outside the mines to ensure production through transportation; second, to solve the power problem, which is a prerequisite for achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization; and then to solve the mechanization and semi-mechanization of mining and tunneling, and to establish exploration teams for resource exploration. After these transformations, the overall mining efficiency of the first batch of nineteen mines transformed in Shandong Province increased by 70% compared to last year, and the ore cost decreased by 12.5% compared to last year. These mines have built more than ninety kilometers of small railways, of which ten mines have been opened to train traffic; a total of sixty-five kilometers of transmission lines have been erected, some connected to power sources, and some have built their own small power stations. In terms of mining and tunneling, ten mines have eliminated hand hammers and manual drilling, which have been replaced by mechanical equipment such as electric drills, rock drills, and simple percussion drills. Liaoning Province carried out technical transformation on six mines in the first half of this year, five of which have basically completed the transformation. These mines have all been electrified, realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization of mining and excavation; four mines have completed the construction of small railways, and the remaining one mine will also be open to train traffic soon.
    Is it to adopt the policy of self-reliance and combining indigenous and foreign methods, or to covet foreign and large equipment and wait for equipment? This is the key to whether the technical transformation of small and medium-sized mines proceeds quickly or slowly. Shandong Province has adopted the former correct policy, and the mine transformation work has progressed very quickly. The province has specifically allocated more than 4,000 tons of steel for the transformation of small and medium-sized mines, and organized mechanical factories in the province to collaborate and manufacture more than 4,000 sets of mining equipment to equip the mines being transformed. While manufacturing these equipment, the mines have also self-reliantly manufactured more than 200 indigenous winches, indigenous endless ropes, and a batch of indigenous mine cars, cableways, funnels, and other transportation tools to solve the problems of lifting and transportation inside the mining areas. The geological exploration force of the mines in Henan Province was originally very weak. In the process of technically transforming the mines, they transferred a certain amount of manpower from the existing mining personnel for short-term training, and in the spirit of self-reliance, making do with whatever was available, they manufactured a batch of indigenous drilling rigs and indigenous tools, and carried out exploration using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. At present, most of the mines in the province have their own exploration teams, which have played a significant role in finding mineral resources for small and medium-sized mines. For example, the Dayugou Iron Mine relied on its own exploration team to obtain 1.8 million tons of iron ore reserves within half a year.
    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently studied the technical transformation work of small and medium-sized mines and instructed the metallurgical industry departments of various provinces and regions to further accelerate the transformation of mines. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also dispatched working groups to eight key ore-producing provinces, including Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Hunan, Sichuan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, to help carry out mine transformation work.

    坚持土洋结合的方针　高速度改变技术面貌
    七十多座中小矿山完成技术改造
    运输作到随产随运，动力设备可以保证三班作业，采掘实现机械化、半机械化，生产水平显著提高
    据新华社讯　全国各地对中小型黑色金属矿山的技术改造工作，已经取得了显著成绩。据冶金工业部最近统计，已经有七十多个矿山完成了技术改造。这些矿山的生产水平和生产规模达到了设计的要求；矿内矿外运输实现了机械化、半机械化，能够保证采多少运多少；有了足够的动力，可以日夜三班作业；消灭了手工凿岩和提升、运输方面的肩挑人背。有一百多个矿山为矿石运输修建了一千多公里的小洋铁路和小土铁路。
    各地对中小型矿山的技术改造，是从今年春天开始的。中小型矿山是中小型钢铁企业的主要原料基地，今年它们担负着全国矿石总产量一半以上的光荣任务。
    根据山东、河北、辽宁、江西、湖南等省的经验，中小型矿山技术改造的主要环节，首先是解决矿内矿外的运输问题，以运保产；其次是解决动力问题，这是实现机械化、半机械化的先决条件；然后是解决采矿、掘进的机械化、半机械化和成立勘探队伍，进行资源勘探。山东省第一批改造的十九处矿山，经过这些改造后，全员采矿效率比去年提高了70％，矿石成本比去年下降了12.5％。这些矿山已经修筑了九十多公里小铁路，其中的十处矿山已经通行火车；一共架设了六十五公里的输电线路，有的接通了电源，有的自己建成了小电站。在采矿、掘进方面，有十处矿山消灭了手锤和人工打眼，由电钻、凿岩机、简易冲击钻等机械所代替。辽宁省今年上半年对六个矿山进行了技术改造，其中的五个已经基本上完成了改造工作。这些矿山已全部通电，实现了采掘机械化、半机械化；四个矿山已经修通了小铁路，余下的一个矿山最近也可以通行火车。
    是采取自力更生、土洋结合的方针，还是贪洋贪大、坐等设备？这是中小型矿山技术改造工作进行得快或慢的关键。山东省就是采取了前一种正确的方针，矿山改造工作进行得很快。这个省已经专门为中小型矿山的改造拨出了四千多吨钢材，并组织省内各机械工厂协作，自己制造了四千多台矿山设备，装备了正在改造的矿山。在制造这些设备的同时，各矿山也自力更生地制造了二百多台土卷扬机、土无极绳和一批土矿车、索道、漏斗等运输工具，解决矿区内部的提升和运输问题。河南省矿山的地质勘探力量原来很薄弱，在对矿山进行技术改造的过程中，他们从现有采矿人员中抽调了一定的人力，进行短期训练，并以自力更生、因陋就简的精神，自己制造了一批土钻机、土工具，用土洋结合的办法进行勘探。目前，全省大部分矿山都有了自己的勘探队，在为中小矿山寻找矿源方面起了很大作用。例如大峪沟铁矿，就是依靠自己的勘探队，在半年内获得了一百八十万吨的铁矿储量。
    冶金工业部最近研究了中小型矿山技术改造工作的情况，指示各省、区冶金工业部门进一步加速矿山的改造工作。冶金工业部还派出工作组，分赴山东、山西、河北、河南、湖南、四川、安徽、江苏等八个矿石生产的重点省，帮助进行矿山改造工作。
