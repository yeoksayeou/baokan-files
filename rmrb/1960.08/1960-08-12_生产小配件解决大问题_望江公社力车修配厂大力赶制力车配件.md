Producing Small Parts Solves Big Problems
Wangjiang Commune’s Handcart Repair Shop Vigorously Rushes Production of Handcart Parts

Editor's Note: Any machine is assembled from a number of parts; if a machine lacks a part, even a small screw, it cannot be used. And in the process of using machines, parts will inevitably be missing due to wear and tear. Therefore, producing small parts is an important task that both protects machines and ensures their use.

The workers of the Wangjiang People's Commune Handcart Repair Shop, overcoming various difficulties, vigorously produced valve needles and old wheel hubs, enabling many means of transportation that could not be used due to the lack of parts to be repaired and put back into production. Producing small parts solves big problems. It is hoped that tool manufacturing and repair shops in various counties and communes will also pay attention to this issue while trial-producing and producing tools.

This newspaper reports: The workers of the Wangjiang People's Commune Handcart Repair Shop in Xiangfan City, proactively seek out product "shortages" to arrange their factory's production, and vigorously rush to produce small parts needed for rural transportation tools. From May of this year to the present, they have produced 230,000 valve needles and 20,000 sets of old wheel hubs, effectively supporting agricultural production.

Valve needles and old wheel hubs may seem like very small parts, but if rubber-wheeled carts and bicycles lack these two small parts, they cannot be used. With the development of industrial and agricultural production and transportation, the demand for these two products has greatly increased. For example, the Nanzhang Sandaohe Water Conservancy Project had more than 2,000 carts that could not be used due to the lack of valve needles and old wheel hubs. A farmer from Zhangwan People's Commune in Xiangyang County damaged a valve needle while transporting grain, causing the tire to deflate and become immobile.

After more than a month of exploration, the workers of the Wangjiang People's Commune Handcart Repair Shop finally successfully trial-produced valve needles and old wheel hubs using manual methods such as pliers, hand files, and drills. The quality of the products produced at the beginning was very poor, and the work efficiency was also very low, with each person averaging only five sets per day, far behind the need. In order to further improve output and quality, the workers, with the spirit of "poor sticks" and continuous revolution, all offered suggestions and innovations. In the absence of machines, technology, and materials, they used their brains and studied hard. They used waste spokes, seat pans, old steel bowls, axle heads, hubs, steel forks, and factory scraps from old bicycles to create eight types of special-purpose machines such as small simple lathes, planers, milling machines, drills, saws, and threaders, as well as thirty-five kinds of cutting tools and molds, arming themselves and realizing the mechanization and semi-mechanization of old wheel hub production. Trainees Zhang Rongqing, Yang Wanhai, and Ma Yongde, using waste axle heads as axles, waste angle iron as partitions, and waste steel sheets as saw discs, created a three-purpose small sawing machine with the help of their master Ji Shangyou, increasing work efficiency by forty-one times. Apprentice Yang Zhenli cooperated with master Zhang Jinliang to adopt new technologies and processes such as precision casting and multi-casting in one mold for valve needle production, increasing work efficiency from 60 sets per day to 200 sets. The product quality reached the level of other places, and the cost was very low, at six cents each. When this batch of products was launched on the market, it was immediately welcomed by the masses. After the Sandaohe Water Conservancy Project purchased them, they quickly repaired the more than 2,000 carts that had been stored for more than three months.

    生产小配件解决大问题
    望江公社力车修配厂大力赶制力车配件
    编者按：任何机具都是由若干零件装配成的；如果机具缺少了零件，那怕是一个小螺丝钉，就不能使用。而机具在使用过程中，经过磨损消耗，总会发生缺少零件现象。因此，生产小配件是既保护机具又保证使用的一个重要工作。
    望江人民公社力车修配厂的职工，克服种种困难，大力生产气门针和老桩，使许多因为缺少配件不能使用的运输工具得以修复，重新投入了生产。生产小配件，解决大问题。希望各地县、社工具制造修配厂，在试制和生产工具的同时，也能注意这个问题。
    本报讯　襄樊市望江人民公社力车修配厂的职工，主动找产品的“缺门”来安排本厂的生产，大力赶制农村运输工具所需的小配件。从今年5月到现在，生产气门针二十三万个、老桩二万套，有力地支援了农业生产。
    气门针和老桩看来都是极小的零件，但胶轮板车、自行车如果缺了这两个小零件，就不能使用。随着工农业生产和交通运输事业的发展，这两种产品的需要量大大增加。如南漳三道河水利工地，就有二千多辆板车因无气门针、老桩而不能使用。襄阳县张湾人民公社有个农民在运粮途中损坏了气门针，车胎跑了气，无法移动。
    望江人民公社力车修配厂的职工经过一个多月的摸索，终于用钳子、手锉、钻子等手工方法试制成功气门针和老桩。开始生产的产品质量很差，工效也很低，每人每天平均只能生产五套，远远落后于需要。为了进一步提高产量和质量，职工们又以“穷棒子”和不断革命的精神，人人献计，个个革新，在没有机器、没有技术、没有材料的情况下，开动脑筋、勤学苦钻。他们利用旧脚踏车的废车幅条、座盘、旧钢碗、轴头、花鼓、钢叉及大厂下脚料，创造了小型简易车、刨、铣、钻、锯、过丝等八种专用机器和三十五种刀具模具，自己武装自己，实现了老桩生产机械化半机械化。学员张荣庆、杨万海、马永德，用废轴头当车轴，用废角铁做隔板，用废钢片做锯盘，在师傅纪尚有的帮助下，创制了一部三用小锯床，提高工效四十一倍。学徒杨振礼与师傅张金良合作，使气门针生产采用了精密铸造、一模多铸等新技术、新工艺，工效由日产六十套提高到二百套，产品质量赶上外地水平，成本很低，每个六分钱。当这批产品上市以后，立即受到群众的欢迎。三道河水利工地购买了以后，很快就将存放了三个多月的二千多部板车修配起来。
