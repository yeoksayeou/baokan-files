To Reap a Bountiful Radish Harvest, Focus on Two Key Stages

Xiao Jia Gang Commune in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, is a region known for its radish production. In particular, the Qun'ai Production Team of this commune is famous for producing radishes that are both plentiful and large. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, this team has fully utilized its many years of experience in radish cultivation, achieving a significant increase in yield compared to the past.

The most significant feature of the radishes grown by this team is that not only is the yield high, but it is also relatively balanced. The key to their success is focusing on the two critical stages of "planting" and "managing." Good planting is the foundation for achieving balanced and increased production. If the planting stage is not handled well, it can lead to unbalanced yields, even severely unbalanced yields. Therefore, every planting season, the Qun'ai Team's Party branch organizes the entire team for discussions and adopts effective measures to ensure successful radish planting. Before the members take action, the cadres and the team's vegetable technical group also take the lead in creating model examples, followed by organizing on-site visits and discussions for the masses. Radishes are root crops that thrive in loose soil with ample fertilizer. Therefore, the Qun'ai Team pays special attention to thoroughly implementing "deep plowing, land preparation," and "layered fertilization" before planting radishes.

After sowing, "management" becomes the central focus for ensuring balanced and increased production. The Qun'ai Team has a saying: "Management is like embroidery." And that is indeed how they approach it. For example, from the time the radish sprouts its first true leaf, they begin thinning the seedlings, followed by topdressing fertilizer, loosening the soil, and weeding. When the second true leaf emerges, they repeat the process of topdressing fertilizer, loosening the soil, and weeding. This continues until the radish plants close ranks, at which point they stop topdressing fertilizer and weeding. Radishes prefer loose soil and organic fertilizer; they are susceptible to pests, waterlogging, drought, weeds, and soil compaction. Therefore, management work must be based on the needs of radish growth and the changes in nature. For example, if the radish leaves are dark green, large, with black spots on them, and the roots are yellowing, it indicates excessive nitrogen fertilizer, so they must stop applying nitrogen fertilizer and appropriately apply some potassium fertilizer. Pests are a major enemy of radishes. The Qun'ai Team has learned from several years of management experience that the effective way to control cabbage webworms is to "treat them early and when they are small." After the second thinning, they must pay attention to pest control.

### 萝卜丰收要抓两关

    萝卜丰收要抓两关
    湖北孝感县萧家港公社是个出产萝卜的地方。特别是这个公社的群爱生产队出产的萝卜又多又大。从大跃进的1958年起，这个队充分运用了多年来种萝卜的经验，单产比以往有很大提高。
    这个队种的萝卜最大特点：不仅单产高，而且比较平衡。经验是要突出的抓好“种”和“管”两关。种好是夺取平衡增产的基础。如果种的一关没有过好，就会出现产量不平衡，甚至严重不平衡的现象。所以每到播种季节，群爱队的党支部就组织全队进行讨论，采取那些有效措施种好萝卜。在社员行动前，干部和队的蔬菜技术组还带头做出样板，再组织群众现场参观讨论。萝卜是块根作物，适合于生长在土质疏松、肥料充足的地方。因此，群爱队特别注意在种萝卜前就狠抓“深耕、整地”和“分层施肥”。
    播种以后，“管”字就成了保证平衡增产的中心。群爱队有这样一句话：“管理如绣花”。他们确实是这样做的。比如萝卜从长出第一片真叶起，就开始间苗，跟着就追肥、松土、锄草。第二片真叶出世，又是追肥、松土、除草。一直到萝卜封行，才停止追肥、除草。萝卜喜欢土壤疏松和有机质肥料，它怕虫、怕渍、怕旱、怕草、怕板结。因此，在管理工作上要从萝卜生长的需要出发，从自然的变化出发。比如发现萝卜叶子浓绿，叶子长得又大、上面起黑点，根部发黄，这是施氮肥太多的结果，就要停止施氮肥，适当追一些钾肥。虫害是萝卜的大敌。群爱队从几年管理工作中摸出治菜螟的有效办法是“治早治小”，在间第二次苗后，就要注意除虫。　湖北日报记者站
