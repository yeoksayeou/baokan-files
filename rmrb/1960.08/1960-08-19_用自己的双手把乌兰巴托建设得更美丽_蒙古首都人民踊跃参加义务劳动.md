Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, August 15th: The people of all circles in the Mongolian capital are enthusiastically participating in voluntary labor to beautify and construct the capital.

Since April this year, the staff and students of various agencies, factories, and schools in Ulaanbaatar have actively responded to the call of the Party Central Committee, volunteering one day every Saturday to engage in activities such as tree planting and turf laying, dressing the capital's streets in green.

Now, this army of voluntary labor, having completed the work of greening the capital, has shifted to basic construction, engaging in the labor of mixing mud and making adobe bricks. A total of more than 17,000 cadres and housewives in the city have participated in this voluntary labor. As of the end of July, they had made more than 1.3 million adobe bricks and built a brick factory of more than 81,000 square meters near the urban area. In addition to making adobe bricks, the participants in brick making also collected old bricks everywhere and handed them over to construction sites.

This voluntary brick-making labor will continue until the end of October. Recently, the Ulaanbaatar Municipal Party Committee decided to have voluntary labor twice a week. Employees and students in Ulaanbaatar will engage in voluntary labor every Wednesday and Saturday.
