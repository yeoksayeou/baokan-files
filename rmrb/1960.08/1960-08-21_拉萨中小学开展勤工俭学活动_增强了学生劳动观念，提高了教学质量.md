Lhasa primary and secondary schools are further implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor through work-study programs. This has improved the quality of teaching and cultivated excellent labor loving qualities in students.

During these activities, the schools, based on their own conditions, established paper making, construction, iron working, sewing, and barber groups. Students in the Lhasa Middle School construction group, under the guidance of their teachers, used their spare time to build a kitchen of more than 30 square meters for the school and repaired the ridges of more than 1,800 meters of surrounding wall, saving more than 4,000 yuan in expenses. During the surge of technological innovation, the teachers, students, and staff of this school worked hard for 20 days and completed 32 innovation projects. They trial-produced nine kinds of teaching aids such as ink and chalk, and manufactured 85 vehicles of various sizes, achieving vehicle-based transportation. Students at Lhasa No. 1 Primary School, with the help of their teachers, also started production activities such as paper making, chalk making, yarn twisting, and cardboard box making, which enhanced students' labor concepts and enabled them to learn production knowledge.

Through practice in work-study activities, students apply the knowledge from their textbooks to production, strengthening their interest in studying courses such as nature, biology, physics, and mathematics. Academic performance has generally improved compared to the past.

    增强了学生劳动观念，提高了教学质量
    本报讯　拉萨市中、小学校在开展勤工俭学活动中，进一步贯彻了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，提高了教学质量，培养了学生热爱劳动的优秀品质。
    在勤工俭学活动中，各学校根据自己的条件，分别成立了造纸、修建、铁工、缝纫和理发等小组。拉萨中学建设组的同学在老师的指导下，利用课余时间，为学校修建了一所三十多平方米的厨房，给一千八百多米长的围墙修了墙脊，节约了四千多元的开支。在大闹技术革新中，这个学校的师生员工苦干二十天，完成了三十二项革新项目，试制成墨水、粉笔等九种教学用具，制造了八十五辆大小车子，在运输上实现了车子化。拉萨第一小学的学生也在老师的帮助下，搞起了造纸、制粉笔、捻毛线、做纸盒等生产，既增强了学生的劳动观念，又使他们学到了生产知识。
    在勤工俭学活动中，学生们通过实践，把书本上的知识运用到生产中去，加强了他们学习自然、生物、物理和数学等课程的兴趣，学习成绩普遍比过去提高。
