Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, August 8th: The Third National Putonghua Teaching Achievement Observation Conference, jointly convened by the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, the Ministry of Education, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, opened in Qingdao on August 1st. By the afternoon of August 6th, the observation performances, evaluations, and awarding of prizes had concluded.

The National Putonghua Teaching Achievement Observation Conference is a grand review of achievements. It is held annually to promote and accelerate the spread of Putonghua, expedite the unification of the national language, and better serve the cause of socialist construction through observation, evaluation, and experience sharing.

This observation conference was presided over by Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee. Ye Shengtao, Vice Minister of Education, Yang Haibo, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Wei Que, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, also attended the conference. In his opening remarks, Wu Yuzhang pointed out that the high tide of the cultural revolution had arrived. The work of writing reform is one of the main tasks in the current cultural revolution. Promoting Putonghua is an important task within the current work of writing reform. He requested that all regions, relying on the leadership of the Party and fully mobilizing the masses, resolutely implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee: "Vigorously promote Putonghua among students, teachers, young workers, farmers, shop assistants, staff, and officers and soldiers of the armed forces to create a prevailing atmosphere." In particular, great efforts should be made to advocate and promote it among young people, adults, and children.

Over three hundred and twenty-one representatives, including school teachers, students, workers, farmers, and representatives from the People's Liberation Army, from twenty-seven provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country participated in the observation conference. These included representatives from more than ten ethnic groups, including Han, Yi, Zhuang, Miao, Mongolian, Tibetan, Korean, Uyghur, Uzbek, Sani, Bai, Tu, Nong, Naxi, She, and Hui. The number of representatives at this conference was nearly double that of the previous conference, and the representation was more extensive than in the previous two conferences. Although the representatives from various regions wore different clothing, and their ages ranged from elderly farmers living in nursing homes to kindergarten children, they had eliminated language barriers and could all communicate and perform in a unified language—Putonghua, with Beijing pronunciation as the standard.

Through the more than two hundred and ninety programs performed by various regions at the observation conference, it can be proven that in the past few years, the work of promoting Putonghua, under the leadership of the Party committees in various regions, has implemented the policy of "vigorous advocacy, focused promotion, and gradual popularization," and has achieved many successes. Especially since 1958, with the new situation of the comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the promotion of Putonghua has not been limited to schools but has spread to the broad masses of society. This time, there were seventy-four representatives from workers, peasants, and soldiers. The number of worker and peasant representatives increased nearly threefold compared to the previous observation conference. Farmer poet Li Junxiang from Dongwangzhuang Commune in Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, farmer poet Zhang Hekuan from the suburban commune of Yingshan County, Hubei Province, worker Kang Jinling from the Shandong Light Industry Electrical Machinery Factory, and Zhuang soldier Tang Kezhong from the Guangzhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, mostly started learning the phonetic alphabet in 1958. Their Putonghua performances all won first prizes in the worker-peasant-soldier group. At the observation conference, Wu Lianzhu, a member of the Chakou People's Commune in She County, Anhui Province, where dialects are complex, and a mother of four children, and Li Fengqing, a teacher at Wu'an Mining District Primary School in Handan City, Hebei Province, used performances that contrasted dialect with Putonghua, powerfully demonstrating that the work of promoting Putonghua is not only vigorously developing in densely populated and easily accessible areas, but is also developing in mountainous areas with blocked transportation, complex dialects, and scattered villages.

Schools are the main battleground for promoting Putonghua. This time, there were one hundred and thirty-seven student and teacher representatives from middle schools, primary schools, and normal schools from various regions participating in the observation conference, accounting for more than 42% of the total number of representatives. Song Dezeng, an eight-year-old first-grade student from Furong Street Primary School in Jinan City, Shandong Province, won first place in the elementary school student performance category for his language reading performance. Song Dezeng learned the phonetic alphabet after enrolling in the fall of 1959. With the help of Hanyu Pinyin, he greatly accelerated his literacy speed. He smoothly read more than one hundred annotated reading materials and self-studied all the language textbooks from the first to the sixth grade of primary school. His knowledge expanded, and his expression ability also greatly improved. At the observation conference, the recitations and storytelling performed by Gao Ji, a six-year-old child from the kindergarten attached to Yan'an Second Road Primary School in Qingdao City, and Wu Si, a five-year-old child from the kindergarten of Qingdao Ocean University, were well-received by the representatives. Ning Chunzhen, a four-year-old child from the Fenlingdu Commune Kindergarten in Ruicheng County, Shanxi Province, participated in a spelling performance. She and Wang Xuxian, a seventy-year-old farmer from Qingtou Commune in Yuncheng County, Chen Ping, an eight-year-old student from Beijing Road Primary School in Qingdao City, and Ning Xuanbo, a twenty-four-year-old worker from Factory 112 in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, jointly won an excellent award for their spelling performance competition. The four-year-old Ning Chunzhen performed very well in terms of both spelling accuracy and spelling speed. This fact fully proves that children in the senior classes of kindergarten are fully capable of learning the phonetic alphabet, can quickly learn Putonghua, and can use the method of phonetic literacy to master a certain number of Chinese characters.

    加速推广普通话
    全国普通话教学成绩观摩会在青岛举行
    吴玉章指出推广普通话是当前文字改革的一项重要任务
    新华社青岛8日电　中国文字改革委员会、教育部、共青团中央联合召开的第三次全国普通话教学成绩观摩会8月1日在青岛开幕，到6日下午，观摩表演，评比和给奖工作已经结束。
    全国普通话教学成绩观摩会是一次检阅成绩的大会。每年召开一次，通过观摩评比，交流经验，促进和加速普通话的推广，促使祖国语言尽快地统一，更好地为社会主义建设事业服务。
    这次观摩会由中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章主持。教育部副部长叶圣陶，共青团中央书记处书记杨海波，中国文字改革委员会副主任韦悫等都出席了会议。吴玉章在开幕会上指出，文化革命的高潮已经到来。文字改革工作是当前文化革命中的主要任务之一。推广普通话又是当前文字改革工作中的一项重要任务。他要求各地依靠党的领导，充分发动群众，坚决贯彻党中央的指示：“在学生、教师和青年工人、农民、店员、职员、部队官兵中大力推广普通话，造成风气。”特别是要在青年、壮年和少年儿童中大力提倡，大力推广。
    参加这次观摩会的有来自全国二十七个省、市、自治区的学校教师、学生、工农群众，以及解放军的代表等共三百二十一人。其中包括汉、彝、僮、苗、蒙古、藏、朝鲜、维吾尔、乌孜别克、撒尼、白、土、侬、纳西、畬、回等十多个民族的代表。这一届代表人数比上届增加了近一倍，代表性比以往两届都更加广泛。各地代表们虽然服装不同；年龄上，有七十岁高龄、生活在敬老院里的老农，也有幼儿园的儿童，可是他们已经消除了语言的隔阂，都能以统一的语言——以北京语音为标准音的普通话交谈，进行观摩表演。
    观摩会上，通过各地演出的不下二百九十个节目，可以证明，几年来推广普通话的工作，在各地党委的领导下，贯彻执行了“大力提倡，重点推行，逐步普及”的方针，已经取得不少成绩。特别是1958年以来，随着工农业生产全面跃进的新形势，促使普通话的推广工作已经不只限于学校范围，而普及到社会广大群众中去了。这次来自工农兵的代表共七十四人。工农代表比上一次观摩会增加近三倍。山东省平原县东王庄公社的农民诗人李俊香，湖北省应山县城郊公社的农民诗人张和宽，山东省轻工业电机厂工人康金玲，解放军广州部队的僮族战士唐克忠等，大多是1958年开始学习拼音字母的，他们的普通话表演，都获得了工农兵组的一等奖。观摩会上，方言复杂的安徽省歙县岔口人民公社社员、四个孩子的妈妈吴莲珠，河北省邯郸市武安矿区小学教师李凤清等，用方言和普通话对照的表演，有力地证明了推广普通话的工作，不仅在人口集中、交通方便的地区蓬勃开展，就是在交通闭塞、方言复杂、村落分散的山区也同样地开展起来了。
    学校是推广普通话的主要阵地。这次参加观摩会的各地中、小学和师范学校的学生、教师代表有一百三十七人，占代表总数的42％以上。山东省济南市芙蓉街小学一年级学生、八岁的宋德增表演的语文朗读，获得小学生表演一等奖第一名。宋德增是1959年秋季入学后学会拼音字母的，他借助汉语拼音大大加快了识字速度，他顺利地阅读了一百多册注音读物，自修了小学一年级到六年级的全部语文课本。他的知识领域扩大了，表达能力也大大提高。观摩会上，青岛市延安二路小学附设幼儿园六岁儿童高佶和青岛市海洋学院幼儿园五岁儿童伍斯表演的朗诵和讲故事，深受代表的欢迎。山西省芮城县风陵渡公社幼儿园四岁幼儿宁春珍参加了拼写表演，她和运城县卿头公社七十岁农民王绪先、青岛市北京路小学八岁的学生陈萍、辽宁省沈阳市一一二厂二十四岁工人宁宣勃等四人，一起进行的拼写表演赛获得了优秀奖。四岁的宁春珍无论在拼写的准确性和拼写速度方面都很好。这个事实充分证明了幼儿园大班的儿童完全能够学好拼音字母，能够很快学好普通话，而且能用注音识字的办法掌握一定数量的汉字。
