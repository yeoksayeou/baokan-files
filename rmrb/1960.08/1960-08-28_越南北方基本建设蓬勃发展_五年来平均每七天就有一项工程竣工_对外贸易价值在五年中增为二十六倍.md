Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 25th: Basic construction work in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been developing vigorously at an unprecedented scale and speed in the years since the restoration of peace in 1955. Over the past five years, the construction sector has completed a total of 223 industrial and civil projects, an average of one project every seven days.

During the long war of resistance, Vietnam's cities, factories, and mines were severely damaged. 85% of the buildings in all the northern towns were reduced to ruins. As soon as the flames of war subsided, the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government, while leading the people to vigorously heal the wounds of war, also carried out large-scale basic construction. Since 1955, investment in basic construction has increased year after year. Taking 1959 as an example, the investment in basic construction that year increased by 67.6% compared to 1958.

Industrial projects occupy a primary position in basic construction investment. Over the past five years, a total of 103 industrial projects have been completed in North Vietnam. The completion of important factories and mines such as the Cao Bang Tin Mine, the Lao Cai Apatite Mine, the Co Dinh Chromite Mine, the Hanoi Machine Factory, and thirteen power plants plays a significant role in the national economy.

At the same time, great achievements have also been made in urban construction. Over the past five years, 50,000 square meters of dilapidated housing have been repaired, and water plants and water towers in cities such as Hanoi, Haiphong, Nam Dinh, Thanh Hoa, and Nghe An have been repaired and expanded. Almost all cities and towns have been installed with electric lights.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 22nd: According to Vietnam News Agency today, the value of goods exchanged between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and other countries has increased twenty-six times in the past five years.

North Vietnam has established trade relations with twenty-seven countries, including eleven socialist countries and Asian-African countries such as Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, the United Arab Republic, and Japan. Compared with 1939, the highest year of economic development in the colonial era, the export of agricultural products such as rice, tea, sesame, and fennel increased by 99% in 1959, and the export of forest products increased by 731%. The export value of industrial and handicraft products such as textiles, knitwear, ready-made garments, leather, rattan products, and bamboo products increased twenty-six times compared to 1939.

    越南北方基本建设蓬勃发展
    五年来平均每七天就有一项工程竣工
    对外贸易价值在五年中增为二十六倍
    据新华社河内25日电　越南民主共和国的基本建设工作，在1955年和平恢复后的年代里，以历史上空前的规模和速度蓬勃发展。五年来，建筑部门共建成了二百二十三项工业和民用工程，平均每七天就有一项工程竣工。
    在长期的抗战中，越南的城市、厂矿企业曾经遭到严重的破坏，全北方的城镇有85％的建筑物变成废墟。当战争的火焰刚刚熄灭，越南劳动党和政府一面领导人民大力医治战争创伤，一面就进行了大规模的基本建设。自1955年以后，用于基本建设的投资年年都有增长。仅以1959年为例，这一年的基本建设投资就比1958年增长67.6％。
    工业工程在基本建设投资中占居着首要地位。五年来，越南北方已建成的工业工程共有一百零三项。其中像高平锡矿、老街磷灰石矿、古定铬铁矿、河内机器厂和十三座发电厂等重要厂矿的建成，对国民经济起着重大作用。
    与此同时，在城市建设方面，也取得了巨大的成绩。五年来，已有五万平方米的破旧的住宅得到修复，河内、海防、南定、清化、宜安等城市的自来水厂和自来水塔已经修复并且进行了扩建。差不多所有的城市、市镇都安装上了电灯。
    据新华社河内22日电　据越南通讯社今天报道，过去五年中，越南民主共和国和其它国家交换的货物价值增加为二十六倍。
    越南北方同二十七个国家建立了贸易关系，其中包括十一个社会主义国家和柬埔寨、印度、印度尼西亚、伊拉克、阿联和日本等亚非国家。与殖民时代经济发展最高年份的1939年相比，1959年大米、茶、芝麻和茴香等农产品的输出增加了99％，林产品输出增加了731％。纺织品、针织品、现成服装、皮革、藤制品和竹制品等工业品和手工业品的输出价值增加为1939年的二十六倍。
