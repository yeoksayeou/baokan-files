　　Twelve Veterans Battle the Mine (Panzi, Flower Drum)
　　Zhang Shangyuan

The pomegranate blossoms red in May,
South Tong Coal Mine spreads joyful news:
Twelve retired veteran workers,
Old in years, but red of heart and strong of will;
Starting from scratch to run a coal kiln,
Without spending a penny of the state's money,
The "poor man's" spirit is praised,
The communist style is spread throughout the world.

On this day, the Fourth Well Retirement Team,
Twelve veterans are chatting.
Mentioning the past, tears fill their eyes,
The miners' life was full of suffering,
Eating vegetable roots and corn stalks,
In the dead of winter, without clothes to wear,
Bosses and foremen like wolves and dogs,
Sucking the miners' blood and sweat dry!

After liberation, seeing the blue sky,
Happy days are sweet in every way,
Happiness comes from the Communist Party,
Trees have roots, and water has a source,
Miners will always follow the Party,
The Party's kindness is remembered in their hearts.

The Coal Mine Party Committee mobilized:
Surpass the Tianfu and catch up with Yutian,
Fight hard for six months to seize high yields,
To present a gift to the Party before July 1st.

A mining competition is launched,
You chase me, and I rush ahead with great energy.
"Which miner doesn't dig coal,
Just goofing off is not comfortable."
"Steelmaking and ironmaking need coal,
Seizing coal and protecting steel should come first."
"Although we are a little old,
How can production not be taken care of!?"
"Let's run a small coal kiln,
Without needing a penny from the state."
"Yes, yes, let's do it,
We'll go find a mine source tomorrow."

Communist Party member Xia Guotai,
Goes ahead in everything;
Old Zhao, Old Wang, and Old Xian,
Have decades of coal mining experience.
The four went out to choose a kiln,
Wading through water and climbing mountains,
Selecting "Number Four Eye",
With plenty of coal and right next to the road.

Writing an application overnight,
Twelve veterans sign their names;
Each word expresses their wishes,
Every sentence shows their firm will,
Asking the Party to approve the coal kiln,
To add strength for the needs of the country,
To achieve communism early,
For the happiness of future generations,
We will work as long as we can move,
Working every day as long as we live!

The Party Committee approved it,
The veterans are very happy,
Talking again at the club,
Tomorrow "May Day" we will start work,
Pickaxes and chisels all prepared,
Baskets and dustpans woven overnight.

On the coal-seizing front, they show their skills again,
Their enthusiasm doubles.
The veterans are not the only ones acting,
Family members are also mobilized,
Old Wang and Old Chen invite their wives,
Going up the mountain before the rooster crows;
Old Du also calls his son,
To come and carry baskets after school,
Old Xian's mobilization is even broader,
His mother-in-law also comes to support.

Men, women, young and old, all participate in the war,
Inviting each other to the coal mountain,
You wield the steel drill and chisel,
I take the hoe and pickaxe.
Two small kilns are built together,
Songs and laughter shake the sky,
Working together with one heart,
Fighting barehanded in the mine.

Without rakes, they chop wood on the mountain,
Without bamboo strips, they weave them themselves,
Pit wood is recovered from old kilns,
Using wood instead of iron to lay the tracks.
They don't care if the rain is heavy and the mountain road is slippery,
They don't care if the sweat soaks through their clothes,
Difficulties can't stop the old heroes,
One veteran is worth three.

Coal is produced eight days after starting work,
Shiny black gold flows out of the mountain,
The small coal kiln achieves high yields,
The output exceeds two tons and three.

The veterans are happy and put in even more effort,
The family members become more and more envious,
Aunt Xian shouts to her mother-in-law,
"Hey, Mother-in-law, hurry up,
We won't stop until we've pushed fifty carts!"

Magpies sing on the coal mountain,
Congratulatory reports fly everywhere,
The mine holds a celebration meeting,
The veterans wear red flowers on their chests.
Leaders come to express their appreciation,
The masses cheer together.
Number Four Eye is named "Old Hero Well,"
The hero's red flag flutters over the mine.

Twelve red hearts are bright and fresh,
Xia Guotai speaks on behalf of the veterans:
"Ten thousand red flowers are connected by one vine,
Miners and the Party are linked heart to heart,
To contribute more to the Party's cause,
Is to spend our later years happily,
We will always follow the Party in the future,
And insist on fighting in the mine."

The pomegranate blossoms are bright red,
The heroic deeds are fresher than the flowers,
Everyone learns from the old heroes,
The great leap forward tide is surging;
Fight hard for six months to seize high yields,
To present a gift to the Party,
To achieve communism early,
Happy life for ten thousand years.
