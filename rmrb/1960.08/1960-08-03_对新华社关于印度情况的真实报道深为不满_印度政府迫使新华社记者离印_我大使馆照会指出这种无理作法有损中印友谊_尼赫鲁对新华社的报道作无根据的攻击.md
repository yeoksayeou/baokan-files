Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd dispatch. The Indian government recently unreasonably refused to allow Gao Liang, a reporter from the New China News Agency's New Delhi bureau, to continue residing in India, and brazenly demanded that the Xinhua News Agency's New Delhi branch "withdraw." Xinhua News Agency reporter Gao Liang left New Delhi and returned to China on August 2nd. Other staff members of the Xinhua News Agency's New Delhi branch also left New Delhi and returned to China because the Indian government unreasonably refused to allow them to continue residing in India.

On July 12th and 16th, Menon, Director of the Press Division of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, met with Gao Liang twice, unreasonably attacking Xinhua News Agency's reports about India as "incorrect" and "interference in India's internal affairs." He expressed particular dissatisfaction with the Xinhua News Agency reporter's coverage of the Indian employees' strike. He said that if such reports continued in the future, the Indian government would have to take "drastic action" and would not allow the Xinhua News Agency to remain in India. Gao Liang then pointed out with reason that his reports were based entirely on truthful reports from Indian news agencies, newspapers, and officially released statements, and that reporting on events occurring in the host country was the duty of every global news agency reporter, and there was no question of interfering in internal affairs.

Subsequently, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs took advantage of Gao Liang's application to the Indian government for an extension of his residency period according to normal procedures, and actually notified Gao Liang that his residency period would only last until August 2nd of this year. On the same day, the Delhi Foreigner Registration Office, in a notice to Gao Liang, insisted that Gao Liang leave India by August 2nd. On July 27th, Gao Liang met with Menon and requested clarification regarding the Indian government's refusal to allow Gao Liang to continue residing in India. In addition to repeating past attacks on Xinhua News Agency, Menon only said that the refusal to allow Gao Liang to continue residing in India was a decision of the Indian government. He said that this was to ask the Xinhua News Agency's New Delhi branch to "withdraw."

On July 30th, a spokesperson for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs announced to the Indian press that visas for Xinhua News Agency reporters to reside in India had been refused. Foreign reporters stationed in Delhi believed that this was equivalent to expelling Xinhua News Agency reporters from the country and was the most severe action taken against foreign journalists in India since its independence.

Even before the Indian government revealed its decision to have the Xinhua News Agency reporter leave New Delhi, a countercurrent of slander against Xinhua News Agency and Chinese newspapers and radio stations had already been set off in Indian official and public circles. On July 19th, Indian Home Minister Pant attacked Chinese newspapers and radio stations for "exaggerating the strike news" and saying with ulterior motives that Chinese newspapers had "shown an extraordinary interest" in the strike when they reported the true situation of the Indian government employees' strike. People's Socialist Party member Pai, "The Times of India," "The Hindustan Times," and others also slandered Xinhua News Agency's reporters in India, saying that their reports on this major event were "interference in India's internal affairs."

Our embassy in India has lodged a note with the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. The note pointed out that the Indian government's unreasonable action against Xinhua News Agency is detrimental to Sino-Indian friendship, and in order to safeguard the friendly relations between China and India and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and in order to safeguard the principle of freedom of the press, it requested the Indian government to restore the legitimate right of Xinhua News Agency reporters stationed in New Delhi to continue residing in India and to cancel the decision to "withdraw" the Xinhua News Agency's New Delhi branch.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 1st dispatch. Xinhua News Agency reporter Gao Liang held a cocktail party here tonight on the eve of his departure from India. The Indian government had unreasonably asked him to leave the country.

Several Indian friends attended the cocktail party, including Sundarlal, Chairman of the India-China Friendship Association and Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, the famous peace leader Dr. Kitchlew, editors and journalists from Indian newspapers and news agencies, professors, and so on. Also attending the cocktail party were the cultural counselors of the Soviet and Polish embassies, the press officers of all other socialist countries' embassies, and all resident journalists of socialist countries currently in the Indian capital. Gao Liang and all the friends attending the cocktail party bid farewell to each other.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 1st dispatch. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in parliament today in response to a question that the government had refused to extend the visa of the Xinhua News Agency reporter because, according to him, reports from Beijing said that the Xinhua News Agency reporter had sent "one-sided and unfounded" reports from India.

The question was raised by a member of parliament regarding the news that the government had refused to extend the visa of a Chinese journalist. Nehru did not point out any specific reports that were one-sided and unfounded in his reply.

### 对新华社关于印度情况的真实报道深为不满  印度政府迫使新华社记者离印  我大使馆照会指出这种无理作法有损中印友谊  尼赫鲁对新华社的报道作无根据的攻击

    对新华社关于印度情况的真实报道深为不满
    印度政府迫使新华社记者离印
    我大使馆照会指出这种无理作法有损中印友谊
    尼赫鲁对新华社的报道作无根据的攻击
    新华社2日讯　印度政府最近无理拒绝中国新华通讯社驻新德里记者高梁继续在印度居留，并且悍然要新华社新德里分社“撤退”。新华社记者高梁已于8月2日离开新德里回国。新华社新德里分社其他工作人员也因印度政府无理拒绝他们继续居留印度而离开新德里回国。
    7月12日和16日印度政府外交部新闻司司长梅农两次约高梁谈话，无理攻击新华社有关印度的报道是“错误的”，是“对印度内政的干涉”。他对新华社记者报道印度雇员罢工特别表示不满。他说如果今后再继续这样报道下去，印度政府将不得不采取“激烈行动”，不允许新华通讯社留在印度。高梁当时即据理指出，他的报道完全是根据印度的通讯社、报纸和官方发布的声明进行如实报道的，而且报道驻在国内发生的事情正是每个世界性通讯社记者的职责，谈不到什么干涉内政。
    接着，印度政府外交部借高梁按照通常手续向印度政府申请延长居留期的机会，竟通知高梁，他的居留期只能到今年8月2日为止。同一天，德里外侨登记处在给高梁的通知中硬要高梁到8月2日就离开印度。7月27日高梁会见梅农，要求对印度政府不允许高梁继续在印度居留一事加以澄清。梅农除了重复过去对新华社的攻击外，只是说不允许高梁继续居留是印度政府的决定。他说，这就是要新华社新德里分社“撤退”。
    7月30日印度外交部一位发言人向印度报界宣布，已经拒绝发给新华通讯社记者居留印度的签证。驻德里的外国记者认为，这等于是驱逐新华通讯社记者出境，是印度独立以来对外国新闻记者采取的一次最严厉的行动。
    早在印度政府透露它要新华社记者离开新德里的决定以前，印度朝野就已掀起了一股诽谤新华社和中国报纸、电台的逆流。印度内政部长潘特7月19日曾就中国的报纸和电台报道印度政府雇员罢工的真实情况一事，攻击中国报纸和电台“渲染罢工消息”，别有用心地说什么中国的报纸对这次罢工“表现了异乎寻常的兴趣”。人民社会党议员帕伊，“印度时报”、“印度斯坦时报”等也都诽谤新华社驻印度的记者有关这一重大事件的报道是“干涉了印度内政”。
    我驻印度大使馆已向印度外交部提出照会，照会指出，印度政府对新华通讯社的无理作法是有损中印友谊的，并且为了维护中印两国的友好关系和和平共处五项原则，为了维护新闻自由的原则，要求印度政府恢复新华通讯社驻新德里记者继续居留的正当权利，取消新华社新德里分社“撤退”的决定。
    新华社新德里1日电　新华社记者高梁今天晚上在离开印度的前夕，在这里举行酒会。印度政府毫无道理地要求他离开这个国家。
    若干印度朋友出席了酒会，其中有印中友好协会主席、全印和平理事会主席森德拉尔，著名的和平领袖克其鲁博士，印度报纸和通讯社的编辑和新闻记者，教授，等等。出席酒会的还有苏联和波兰大使馆的文化参赞，所有其他社会主义国家大使馆的新闻官员以及社会主义国家所有目前在印度首都的驻印记者。高梁和出席酒会的所有朋友们互相话别。
    新华社新德里1日电　印度总理尼赫鲁今天在议院答复问题时说，政府拒绝延长新华社记者的签证是因为，按照他的说法，根据从北京来的报告说，新华社记者从印度发出了“片面的和没有根据的”报道。
    这个问题是由一位议员就政府拒绝延长中国记者的签证的消息提出的。尼赫鲁在答复时没有指出任何一条具体的报道是片面的和没有根据的。
