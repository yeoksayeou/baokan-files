Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The Chairman of the Southwest African National Union, Kozonguizi, who is currently visiting China, strongly condemned American imperialism for supporting South Africa's colonial rule over Southwest Africa when he met with a reporter from this agency in Beijing on the 18th. He also denounced British imperialism as an active supporter of South African colonialism.

Kozonguizi said that American and British imperialism and the South African colonial authorities it supports are the main enemies of the Southwest African national independence movement. He said that the basic goal of the Southwest African National Union is to strengthen the struggle in order to win complete independence and freedom for Southwest Africa immediately, so that Southwest Africa truly belongs to the African people.

Kozonguizi said: "We believe that our struggle is not isolated. Our struggle is closely linked to the international struggle against imperialism. We are fighting for the political and economic independence of our country and against imperialism; the Chinese people, who have gained political and economic independence and achieved great achievements, are also fighting against the threat of imperialism. Therefore, our struggles are common, and we support each other in the struggle."

He said: "In the struggle, we also emphasize strengthening relations with some African organizations and with the Asian-African Solidarity Committee."

Kozonguizi denounced American imperialism for vigorously supporting the South African colonialists economically and militarily. South Africa has built a huge army with US military equipment, and US pilots are training the South African air force. He also denounced American imperialism for directly exploiting Southwest Africa economically. For example, the "Tsumeb Corporation," controlled by US capital, monopolizes the production of copper in Southwest Africa, and the "De Beers Diamond Company," sponsored by US, British and South African capital, monopolizes the production of diamonds in Southwest Africa.

He pointed out that the American neo-colonialists are taking new measures to massively infiltrate Africa, first of all through investment, and have bought some lackeys in Africa and politically controlled them. Kozonguizi pointed out that American monopoly capitalist Nelson Rockefeller said as early as 1956: "Where soldiers have failed, dollars can succeed." This is the means of American neo-colonialism. Another method of American neo-colonialism is to use the banner of the United Nations to infiltrate, such as in the Congo. Kozonguizi said: "I have finally discovered the role and nature of the United Nations. It is just a tool of the United States and Britain. The Southwest African issue has been discussed in the United Nations for fourteen years, and many resolutions have been passed every year, but so far I have never seen it play any role. The United States and Britain have never voted in favor of our Southwest Africa either. The United Nations, under the manipulation of the United States, has also done things like the Korean War!"

He said: "I have now come to the conclusion that continuing to rely on the United Nations will lead us to a dead end. The actions of the United Nations in the Congo are proof of this."

Kozonguizi said that what happened in the Congo also shows how dangerous it is for a country to continue to rely on the technology of its former colonial masters after gaining independence, and how much damage and subversion the country will suffer. He said: "Therefore, we advocate self-reliance after independence, and of course we also need friendly foreign aid."

Kozonguizi arrived in Beijing on the 14th. Hu Yuzhi, Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, hosted a banquet to welcome him on the evening of the 17th. This afternoon, Liu Changsheng, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, met with him and had a cordial conversation with him.

    西南非民族联盟主席科章吉齐发表谈话
    谴责美国新殖民主义的罪行
    强调各国人民在反帝斗争中互相支援
    新华社19日讯　正在我国访问的西南非洲民族联盟主席科章吉齐18日在北京接见本社记者时，强烈地谴责美帝国主义支持南非联邦对西南非洲实行殖民统治。他还斥责英帝国主义也是南非联邦殖民主义的积极支持者。
    科章吉齐说，美、英帝国主义及其所支持的南非联邦殖民主义，是西南非洲民族独立运动的主要敌人。他说，西南非洲民族联盟的基本目标是：加强斗争，以争取西南非洲立即获得完全的独立和自由，使西南非洲真正属于非洲人民。
    科章吉齐说：“我们相信，我们的斗争不是孤立的。我们的斗争是和国际上反对帝国主义的斗争紧系在一起的。我们正在为我们国家政治上和经济上的独立、为反对帝国主义而斗争；已经获得政治上和经济上的独立并取得了伟大成就的中国人民也在为反对帝国主义的威胁而斗争。因此，我们的斗争是共同的，我们在斗争中互相支援。”
    他说：“在斗争中，我们还强调要加强和非洲的一些组织以及和亚非团结委员会的关系。”
    科章吉齐斥责美帝国主义从经济上和军事上大力支持了南非联邦殖民主义者。南非联邦靠着美国的军事装备建立了一支庞大的军队，美国飞行员在训练南非联邦的空军。他还斥责美帝国主义从经济上直接剥削西南非洲。例如，美国资本控制的“丘密布公司”垄断了西南非洲铜的生产，美国资本控制了由英国和南非联邦的资本主办的“德皮尔斯金刚石公司”，从而垄断了西南非洲金刚石的生产。
    他指出，美国这个新殖民主义者正在采取新的办法大举渗入非洲，首先就是通过投资进行渗入，并在非洲收买了一些走狗，在政治上控制了他们。科章吉齐指出，美国大垄断资本家纳尔逊·洛克菲勒在1956年就说过：“在士兵们失败了的地方，美元可以取得成功。”这便是美国新殖民主义的手段。美国新殖民主义的另一个办法就用利用联合国的招牌进行渗入，例如对刚果。科章吉齐说：“我终于发现了联合国的作用和本质。它只不过是美国和英国的一个工具而已。西南非洲的问题在联合国讨论了十四年，每年都通过了许多决议，但是到现在为止从来没有见它起过什么作用。美国和英国也从没有投过赞成我们西南非洲的票。联合国在美国的操纵下还干过像朝鲜战争那样的事！”
    他说：“我现在得出了这样的结论：继续依靠联合国，将把我们带到绝境。联合国在刚果的行径便是一个证明。”
    科章吉齐说，在刚果发生的事情还表明，一个国家取得独立后，如果继续依赖于从前的殖民者的技术，将使这个国家遭受何等的破坏和颠覆的危险。他说：“因此，我们主张在独立后要自力更生，当然也需要友好的外援。”
    科章吉齐是在14日到达北京的。中国人民外交学会副会长胡愈之曾在17日晚上设宴欢迎他。今天下午，中国非洲人民友好协会会长刘长胜接见了他，并且同他进行了亲切的谈话。
