Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Under the fostering of U.S. imperialism, West German militarism is becoming increasingly rampant. The West German "Bundeswehr" General Staff issued a memorandum on the 19th, publicly clamoring for expanding armaments and preparing for war, demanding that the West German army be equipped with atomic weapons. West German Chancellor Adenauer and Defense Minister Strauss also expressed their complete agreement with this memorandum on the 26th.

The West German "Bundeswehr" General Staff's memorandum demands that the West German "Bundeswehr" must be equipped with atomic weapons, just like the so-called "shield" forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies.

The memorandum, using the pretext that "the enemy will choose poorly equipped troops as targets of attack, thereby shattering the entire defense of Europe," clamors that the so-called "shield" forces of Western Europe, including the West German army, must possess tactical atomic weapons. It clamors that this is an "indispensable deterrent force" for the armies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

In discussing relations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the memorandum states that West Germany resolutely subordinates itself to this aggressive bloc. It also says that it is "impractical for West Germany not to make a military contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." On the 26th, West German Chancellor Adenauer and Defense Minister Strauss held talks on the West German "Bundeswehr" General Staff's memorandum, reiterating West Germany's demand for atomic armament.

After the talks, an unusual step was taken, and a press release of the two men's talks was issued, announcing that the West German government "completely agreed" with the demands made by the West German generals, and said that these demands were "completely in line" with the West German government's "security policy implemented for many years."

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Associated Press reporter Gaver revealed in a message from London on the 22nd that the Supreme Allied Commander Europe of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, U.S. General Norstad, has requested permission for West Germany to build warships of greater tonnage and other "offensive" weapons.

The reporter said that General Norstad recently made a suggestion to the London headquarters of the seven-nation Western European Union, allowing West Germany to manufacture weapons that it has been prohibited from manufacturing until now. The weapons suggested for manufacture include: two 6,000-ton destroyers equipped with missiles capable of launching nuclear warheads, a 6,000-ton supply ship, and induction (i.e., electronic) mines that explode by means of sound waves, which are prohibited from being manufactured as offensive weapons.

The message revealed that Norstad requested further amendments to the Brussels Treaty for this purpose. In his letter to the Western European Union, he explained that this amendment was in order to supposedly enable West Germany to "fulfill its mission in the Baltic Sea."

The Associated Press message pointed out that to allow West Germany to manufacture induction mines, it would have to be allowed to establish an industrial complex, which could eventually produce other electronically controlled weapons, including rockets. These weapons are of an offensive nature.

    在美帝国主义支持下加紧复活军国主义
    西德“国防军”公然要求原子武装
    美国将军竟要西德建造“进攻”性武器
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在美帝国主义的扶植下，西德军国主义的气焰日益嚣张。西德“国防军”参谋部19日发表了一项备忘录，公然大肆叫嚣扩军备战，要求以原子武器装备西德军队。西德总理阿登纳和国防部长施特劳斯在26日也表示完全同意这个备忘录。
    西德“国防军”参谋部的备忘录要求西德“国防军”必须和北大西洋集团盟国的所谓“盾牌”部队一样用原子武器装备起来。
    备忘录借口“敌人会选中劣势装备的部队作为进攻的目标，从而粉碎整个欧洲的防御”。因而叫嚣西欧的所谓“盾牌”部队，当然也包括西德军队在内，必须拥有战术原子武器。它叫嚣这是北大西洋集团军队“不可缺少的威慑力量”。
    在谈到对北大西洋集团的关系时，备忘录表示西德坚决从属于这个侵略集团。并且说，西德“不为北大西洋集团在军事上作出贡献是不合实际的”。26日，西德总理阿登纳同国防部长施特劳斯就西德“国防军”参谋部的这个备忘录举行了会谈，重申西德要求原子武装。
    会谈后采取不同寻常的步骤，发表了两人的会谈公报，宣布西德政府“完全同意”西德将军们提出的要求，并且说这些要求“完全符合”西德政府“多年来执行的安全政策”。
    新华社讯　美联社记者加弗向22日从伦敦发出的一条消息透露，北大西洋集团欧洲总司令美国将军诺斯塔德已要求允许西德建造吨位更大的军舰和其他“进攻”性武器。
    这个记者说，诺斯塔德将军最近向七国西欧联盟伦敦总部提出一项建议，允许西德制造迄今为止禁止它制造的武器。建议制造的武器包括：两艘装备有能发射核弹头的导弹的六千吨的驱逐舰，一艘六千吨的供应舰，以及作为进攻性武器而被禁止制造的通过声波来爆炸的感应（即电子）水雷。
    消息透露，诺斯塔德为此要求进一步修改布鲁塞尔条约。他在给西欧联盟的信里解释说，这种修改是为了所谓使西德能“履行它在波罗的海的任务”。
    美联社的消息指出，要让西德制造感应水雷，就得允许它兴办一个工业综合中心，这种综合中心最后也能生产其他包括火箭在内的电子控制武器。这种武器具有进攻的性质。
