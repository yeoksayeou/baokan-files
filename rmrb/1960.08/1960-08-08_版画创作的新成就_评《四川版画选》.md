	New Achievements in Printmaking
	——Review of "Selected Sichuan Prints"	Ma Ke
	Sichuan prints have been well-received by audiences in many recent exhibitions. The recently published "Selected Sichuan Prints" has garnered even more praise for its broad depiction of life, rich and profound imagery, and refreshing style. This anthology not only concentrates on showcasing the current level of Sichuan printmaking, but also demonstrates new achievements in Chinese printmaking in terms of reflecting the depth of life and the originality of formal styles.
	The seventy-one works in the anthology are representative print works from the Sichuan region in the decade since the liberation in 1949. From the perspective of subject matter, the motherland's industrial and agricultural production and construction, the lives and struggles of the working people, the new life of fraternal ethnic groups, the happy growth of children, the beautiful and bright natural scenery, and the various magnificent appearances of socialist construction are all reflected with enthusiasm and vitality to varying degrees. While the quality of the works varies, on the whole, they are full of enthusiasm for real life, praising the Party's general line for building socialism, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes from various aspects. In particular, many works profoundly reveal the noble qualities and rich spiritual outlook of the working people of our time. Xu Kuang's "Waiting for the Ferry" and Zhu Xuanxian's "Night" are two examples. "Waiting for the Ferry" uses clear and powerful strokes to depict the images of four young surveying team members. The author does not place them in the midst of intense labor, but rather processes them at the moment of preparing to participate in construction, with the aim of better displaying the characters' mental state. They are sitting on the bow of the boat waiting for the ferry, some opening notebooks to study, and others looking up and gazing into the distance. Although the surrounding scenery is not shown in the picture, one can associate the growth of these young people and the magnificent cause they are about to devote themselves to from their serious and earnest attitude and excited mood when they first participated in the construction, along with their eyes full of confidence and hope. From the limited painting, one can appreciate the broad and far-reaching meaning, truly expressing endless ideas with limited words. If this is a hymn to new people, then "Night" is a serenade praising new things. On a clear and moonlit night, the children in the nursery have all fallen asleep sweetly, but the hardworking nursery worker still quietly stands by the window, caring for them meticulously. This not only reflects the love of ordinary workers for their careers, but also vividly demonstrates the growth of new moral qualities. The whole painting has a novel style and a profound artistic conception. Although the characterization of the characters is not perfect enough, it does not lose its deeply moving power. Other works such as Li Shaoyan's "Yearning," Wu Fan's "The Cuckoo Called," Gong Yuanlin's "Little Carpenter," Li Huanmin's "Plateau Canyon," and Yuan Jizhong's "Driven Away the Bandits" all vividly shape the glorious image of the new people of our new era and the new relationships between people that are constantly undergoing profound changes.
	This keen observation of new things and the ability to discover new artistic conceptions in ordinary life phenomena are also reflected in many works with the life of fraternal ethnic groups as their subject matter. For example, Li Shaoyan and Niu Wen's "Good News of Peaceful Liberation," Niu Wen's "The East is Red, the Sun Rises" (see illustration), Li Huanmin's "Yang Qingke" and "Weaving Flower Carpets," and Song Guangxun's "Hygiene Training Class" are all known for their full sense of life and vivid image creation, with no trace of "exoticism." The characters appearing in these works are all vividly standing images; under the leadership of the Party, their material life and spiritual outlook have undergone fundamental changes, and they have completely gotten rid of enslavement and exploitation, and have begun to create a happy life with their own labor. Such paintings can only be painted by painters who have a deep and correct understanding of the life, struggle, and spiritual world of the fraternal ethnic groups.
	Under the guidance of the Party's policy of literature and art serving the workers, peasants and soldiers and letting a hundred flowers bloom, Sichuan printmaking is not only new in content, but also diverse in form and style and full of originality. Whether it is light and lively, or thick and rich, or simple and elegant, or fresh and beautiful, all of them permeate the strong spirit of the times, touching people's hearts with the creation of deep meaning in the ordinary and the charm of printmaking art. In terms of personal style, it is also changing. For example, comparing the early and recent works of comrades Niu Wen and Wu Fan, one can see the bold creative spirit of the painters. Many painters have also paid attention to learning and absorbing the strengths of national traditional painting, but they are not rigidly imitating the ancients or simply pursuing the interest of knife engraving and ink printing, but rather integrating and creating new explorations and creations. In addition to the works mentioned above, which are all good examples, I would also like to talk about Wu Fan's "Dandelion." This painting is a sketch depicting children's life, but due to the painter's wonderful creation, especially the portrayal of the little girl's endearing childishness and innocent expression, this small picture adds a force that makes people ponder. In terms of technique, it creatively develops the traditional watermark method, using lines of varying thickness and elegant and clear tones to enhance the picture's charm and interest. In the picture, except for the little girl and a basket and a sickle, there is no other background. This ingenious use of large blank spaces is also a good tradition of our national painting. It not only does not feel empty, but instead creates an open world, inspiring reverie. This painting has been loved by the masses and won a gold medal in the Leipzig International Printmaking Competition last year.
	What is even more commendable is that, in addition to a few old printmakers, most of the contributors to this anthology are young and amateur authors. It is understood that among the hundreds of printmakers in Sichuan Province, new forces account for 80%. They have all grown up in recent years, and some are even recent graduates. Their life foundation and artistic cultivation are not deep enough, but under the cultivation of the Party and the help of the older generation of painters, as well as their own hard work, they have created many good works. This is the new force of Sichuan printmaking and a great victory for the Party's literary and artistic policy.
	"Selected Sichuan Prints" and many excellent print collections and anthologies published throughout the country mark the vigorous development of Chinese printmaking art. May the level of printmaking creation in our country reach new heights, and strive for newer achievements on the basis of new achievements.

    版画创作的新成就
    ——评《四川版画选》	马克
    四川版画近年在不少展览会中，都受到了观众的喜爱。不久前出版的《四川版画选》，更以其广阔的生活画面，丰富深刻的形象和清新的风格而得到人们的赞赏。这本选集不仅集中地表现了四川版画目前的创作水平，而且就反映生活的深度和形式风格的独创来说，也显示了我国版画创作的新成就。
    选集中的七十一幅作品，都是四川地区自1949年解放十年来的版画代表作。从题材看，祖国工农业的生产建设，劳动人民的生活和斗争，兄弟民族崭新的生活风貌，少年儿童幸福的成长，优美明丽的自然景物，以及社会主义建设的种种丰姿伟貌，都在不同程度上得到热情而生动的反映。作品的质量虽高低互见，参差不齐，但总的看来，都对现实生活充满着热情，从多方面歌颂了党的建设社会主义总路线、大跃进和人民公社。特别是不少作品还深刻地揭示了我们时代劳动人民崇高的品质和丰富的精神面貌。如徐匡的《待渡》和朱宣咸的《夜》就是两个例子。《待渡》以清晰有力的刀笔，刻划了四位青年测量队员的形象。作者不把他们安排在紧张的劳动之中，而把他们处理在准备参加建设之时，其目的就在于更好地展示人物的精神状态。他们正坐在船头待渡，有的翻开笔记本在学习，有的昂首眺望着远方。画面上虽没有表现出周围的景物，然而从他们那种刚开始参加建设时严肃认真的态度和激动的心情，随着他们那些充满信心和希望的眼神，可以联想到这些青年的成长和他们将要投身进去的壮丽的事业。从有限的画幅中，可以体会出广阔深远的含意，真是言有尽而意无穷。如果说这是对新人的颂歌，那么《夜》则是赞美新事物的小夜曲。风清月明之夜，托儿所的孩子们都已香甜地睡去，可是辛勤的保育员还悄悄地站在窗口无微不至地关怀着他们。这里既反映了平凡劳动者对自己事业的热爱，也生动地表现出新道德品质的成长。整幅画格调新颖，意境深远，尽管人物的形象刻划还不够完美，但并没有因此而丧失其感人至深的力量。其他如李少言的《向往》、吴凡的《布谷鸟叫了》、龚远林的《小木匠》、李焕民的《高原峡谷》和袁吉中的《赶走了叛匪》等等，也都鲜明地塑造了我们新时代新人物的光辉形象，和人与人之间那种不断发生深刻变化的新关系。
    这种对新鲜事物敏锐的观察力，和善于在平凡的生活现象里发掘新意境的才能，同样也表现在以兄弟民族生活为题材的许多作品中。例如李少言、牛文的《和平解放的喜讯》、牛文的《东方红、太阳升》（见插图）、李焕民的《扬青稞》和《织花毯》、宋广训的《卫生训练班》等，都以丰满的生活实感和鲜明的形象创造而著称，毫无《猎奇逐异》的迹象。出现在这些作品中的人物，都是活生生地站得起来的形象；他们在党的领导下，物质生活和精神面貌都发生了根本的变化，已彻底摆脱掉奴役和压榨，开始用自己的劳动缔造幸福的生活。这样的画，只有对兄弟民族人民的生活斗争和精神世界有深刻而正确理解的画家才能画得出。
    在党的文艺为工农兵服务和百花齐放的方针指导下，四川版画不仅内容新，而且形式风格也多种多样富有独创的特色。或轻盈明快，或浑厚浓郁，或质朴淡雅，或清新优美，无不渗透着强烈的时代精神，以寓深意于平凡的创造和版画艺术的魅力而打动人心。就个人的风格来说也在变化中，如比较牛文和吴凡等同志早期和近期的作品，便可看出画家们大胆的创造精神。不少画家还着意学习和汲取了民族传统绘画的长处，但并不是生硬地摹仿古人，或单纯地追求刀版和水墨印刷的趣味，而是融合贯通，进行了新的探索和创造。除前面提到的作品都是很好的例证，这里还想再谈谈吴凡的《蒲公英》。这幅画是描绘儿童生活的小品，可是由于画家的美妙创造，尤其对小姑娘那种逗人喜爱的稚气和天真的神情刻划，使这个不大的画面平添了耐人寻味的力量。在技法上创造性地发挥了传统水印的方法，以粗细有致的线条和典雅明朗的调子，增强了画面的风韵和情趣。画中除小姑娘和一只篮一把镰刀外，别无任何背景。这种大片空白的巧妙利用，也是我国民族绘画的优良传统，看去不但不感到空虚，反而却创造了一个开阔的天地，引人遐想。这幅画曾受到广大群众喜爱，去年在来比锡国际版画比赛中还获得了金质奖章。
    更值得称道的是，这本选集中除少数的老版画家外，大多数都是青年和业余作者。据了解，在四川全省百多个版画家中，新生力量却占80％的比例。他们都是近年来新成长起来的，有的甚至还是刚刚毕业的学生。他们的生活基础和艺术修养都不够深厚，可是在党的培养和老一辈画家的帮助以及自己的刻苦钻研下，已创作了许多好作品。这是四川版画的生力军，也是党的文艺方针的巨大胜利。
    《四川版画选》和全国各地出版的许多优秀的版画专集和选集，标志了我国版画艺术的蓬勃发展。愿我国版画创作的水平一峰高过一峰，在新的成就上争取更新的成就。
