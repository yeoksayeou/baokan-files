Holding meetings is a leadership method; it is impossible to do work and make revolution without meetings. However, meetings can be few or many, short or long, good or bad. "Few, short, good" and "many, long, bad" reflect two different working methods, and naturally lead to two different results. A short and lively meeting can educate and inspire many people, filling them with energy; such a meeting, even if held less frequently, can get the work done well. On the other hand, a long and empty meeting that doesn't solve practical problems only wastes time and energy.

Of course, this is not to say that large, long meetings should never be held. Rather, it depends on the target audience, the needs, and the timing. For example, fewer meetings should be held during the busy farming season, and more meetings can be held during the slack season. Mass meetings should be held less frequently, while small-scale discussion meetings and cadre meetings can be held more frequently. Even if it is necessary to hold large, long meetings, they should be thoroughly prepared to be as short and effective as possible. After the implementation of the "two-five system" and "three-seven system" of leadership in rural areas, the work style of cadres has greatly improved, and meetings have been significantly reduced, which is a good phenomenon. However, some meetings are still not short enough or good enough. This requires rural work comrades to use their brains and study how to make meetings shorter and better. Generally speaking, holding fewer meetings is easy to achieve, as long as the leadership is determined. However, to make them short and good, one must put in some effort to study and research.

The "short" here means shortening the time; for example, a commune member meeting should ideally be completed in an hour or two. The "good" means improving the quality and achieving the objective. "Short" and "good" seem to contradict each other, but in fact they are both contradictory and unified, and ultimately unified. Short meetings are more likely to be attended willingly, listened to attentively, and thought about actively, and participants are more likely to express their opinions. Combined with the subjective efforts of the meeting organizers, they can certainly be successful.

Frankly speaking, it is not easy to make a meeting short, good, and achieve its purpose; it requires tremendous effort. I believe it is necessary to "grasp the center, prepare thoroughly, be lively and vivid, and speak freely." Grasping the center means focusing on the problems that the masses urgently need to solve, and focusing on the main contradictions in the current work, and addressing them in the meeting. When the main contradiction is resolved, the secondary contradictions will be easily solved, which is called "grabbing the bull by the horns." If the main contradiction cannot be grasped, and one attempts to solve all problems in one meeting, the result will be: first, the time is prolonged; second, the problems are not solved; and third, nothing is accomplished; it is the same as not holding a meeting or not holding it well. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the work style in normal times and learn to grasp the main contradictions. After grasping the main contradictions, to make the meeting successful, a process of investigation, understanding, and preparation of materials is still needed. Some meetings are not successful because this process is missing. A meeting involves many people, and there are bound to be various different thoughts and viewpoints. To unify these thoughts and viewpoints, there needs to be sufficient material to persuade people with facts. One must know in advance what thoughts and viewpoints the masses have, and what factual materials should be used to address these thoughts and viewpoints; hold the meeting only when the materials are sufficient and there is a certainty of success. At each meeting, the chair is bound to say a few words and make a report. To make the report lively, in addition to grasping the center and preparing thoroughly, one must also learn the techniques. That is, one must pay attention to the art of language and logic, and try to make the report brief, lively, well-organized, and persuasive. To improve the level of linguistic art, the key lies in practice and learning, learning from the masses, and learning from books. It is very important to speak in the language of the masses. Chairman Mao's articles have a tight structure and exquisite language, and we should study them carefully. A person who chairs a meeting should not only speak himself, but also inspire the masses to speak, allowing them to fully express their thoughts and viewpoints, and then engage in free debate; this is called both meeting and discussing, and this is called educating the masses with the masses.

It should also be clear that meetings are a means, not an end, and holding meetings is not the only way to carry out work. What is more important is practical work, and practical work is the basis of meetings. Holding a meeting is either to implement work or to summarize work. Implementing work is not the same as holding a meeting. It also requires action after the meeting to test whether the meeting was successful and to determine whether the work can be successful and the task can be completed. Therefore, meeting, action, re-meeting, re-action, until the work is done and the task is completed; this is the usual pattern for carrying out a piece of work. Only by attaching importance to doing practical work, going deep into the production site, solving practical problems, and combining meetings with practical work is correct. We are against the work method of only being satisfied with holding meetings and making general appeals.

    少开会  开短会  开好会
    中共浙江省东阳县委书记处书记  邢振东
    开会是一种领导方法，做工作，干革命不开会是不行的。但是，会议可以少也可以多，可以短也可以长。可以好也可以差。“少、短、好”和“多、长、差”反映出两种不同的工作方法，自然也得出两种不同的结果。一次短而生动的会议可以使许多人受教育，受激发，浑身添劲，这种会议即使少开一些也能把工作做好；而一个长而且空，不解决实际问题的会议，则只有浪费时间，消耗精力。
    当然，这样讲并不是说大型的、时间较长的会议不可以开了，而是说要看对象，看需要，看时机。比如说，农忙时应当少开，农闲时可以多开；群众大会应当少开，小规模的座谈会、干部会可以多开。即使需要召开大型的、时间较长的会议，也应充分准备，尽可能地求其短，求其好。农村实行“二五制”和“三七制”的领导方法后，干部作风有了很大改进，会议已经显著减少了，这是好现象。但是，还有些会议开得不短，开得不好。这就需要农村工作同志们都来动动脑筋，研究研究怎样把会议开短开好。一般地讲，少开会是容易办到的，只要领导下决心就行；要短、要好，就非得下点钻劲钻研一下不可了。
    这里所说的“短”就是缩短时间，譬如一个社员大会最好能用个把钟头开好它。所谓“好”就是提高质量，达到目的。“短”和“好”看来是互相矛盾的，其实它们之间也矛盾也统一，归根结蒂还是统一的。短的会议，人家愿意参加，愿意用心听，愿意动脑筋，愿意发表意见，加上会议组织者的主观努力，就一定能开好。
    说实在话，把一个会议要开短、开好，达到目的，不是轻而易举的，需要付出巨大的努力才行。我认为需要做到“抓住中心，充分准备，生动活泼，畅所欲言”。抓住中心就是说要抓住群众迫切要求解决的问题，抓住当前工作中的主要矛盾，付诸会议；主要矛盾解决了，次要矛盾迎刃而解，这叫做“牵牛鼻子”。如果主要矛盾抓不住，什么问题都想在一次会议上解决，其结果是：一延长时间，二解决不及，三不了了之；等于不开或没开好。因此就需要在平时改进作风，学会抓主要矛盾。主要矛盾抓住后，要把会议开好，还需一个调查了解、准备材料的过程。有些会议没有开好，就是没有这个过程。一个会，有许多人参加，难免有各种不同的思想和观点，要把这些思想和观点统一起来，就需要有充分的材料，以事实说服人家。一定要事先知道，群众有哪些思想和观点，这些思想和观点应当拿什么事实材料去解决；到材料充分，确有把握的时候再开会。每一次会议，主持者难免要讲几句话，作个报告。要把报告作生动，除了抓住中心，充分准备以外，还要学会技巧。也就是说要讲究语言艺术，讲究逻辑，尽量使报告作得简短生动，条理分明，入人心坎。要提高语言艺术的水平，关键在于锻炼和学习，向群众学习，向书本学习。用群众的语言讲话是很重要的。毛主席的文章结构严密，语言精湛，我们更应当认真学习。一个主持会议的人，不仅要自己讲话，而且要启发群众讲话，让他们充分谈出自己的思想和观点，然后展开自由的论争，这叫做也会也议，这叫做以群众教育群众。
    还应当明确，会议是手段不是目的，开会也不是进行工作的唯一方法。更重要的是实际工作，实际工作是会议的基础。开一次会，要不是贯彻工作就是总结工作，贯彻工作不等于开一次会议就行，还需要在会议以后抓行动，在行动中考验会议是否开得好，在行动中决定工作能否胜利，任务能否完成。因此，会议，行动，再会议，再行动，直至做好工作，完成任务；这是进行一次工作的通常规律。只有重视做好实际工作，深入生产现场，解决实际问题，把会议和实际工作结合起来，才是正确的。我们反对那种只满足开会和一般号召的工作方法。
