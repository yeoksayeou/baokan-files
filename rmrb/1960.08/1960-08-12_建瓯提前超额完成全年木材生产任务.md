Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 11th August: Jian'ou County, Fujian Province, which has been awarded the title of National Advanced Unit in Timber Production for two consecutive years, has once again exceeded its annual timber production target four months ahead of schedule this year. As of August 4th, the county had delivered 519,458 cubic meters of timber, exceeding the annual delivery target by 3.89%.

Jian'ou County is one of the main timber producing areas in Fujian. The Jian'ou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has always attached great importance to timber production, implementing unified planning, unified contracted tasks, and unified inspections in vigorously promoting timber production. In addition to the First Secretary of the County Committee grasping the work regularly and one secretary specifically managing it, each commune and brigade also has a secretary or commune head/team leader specifically in charge of timber production. As early as after the autumn harvest last year, the county seized the favorable opportunity of slightly less agricultural work to mobilize the masses to cut down trees in large quantities, and by the Spring Festival, 620,000 cubic meters of timber had been felled, creating a material foundation for this year's timber delivery. In order to complete the annual timber delivery task ahead of schedule and exceed the target, the vast number of timber transport workers, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, also continuously fought against natural disasters such as drought and floods. This spring, a long drought led to dry riverbeds, so commune members and state-owned logging farm workers built dams on small streams to store water, constructing more than 8,000 various dams, greatly raising the water level of the streams and rivers, and smoothly carrying out timber floating work. In May and June, there was more rainfall and the water level of the streams and rivers rose, and under the leadership of the County Committee, the vast number of workers and commune members vigorously engaged in transporting timber by floodwaters, ensuring that the annual timber delivery task was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target.

    建瓯提前超额完成全年木材生产任务
    新华社福州11日电　连续两年获得全国木材生产先进单位称号的福建省建瓯县，今年又提前四个月超额完成了全年木材生产任务。到8月4日止，全县已送材到材五十一万九千四百五十八立方米，超额3.89％完成全年送材、到材任务。
    建瓯县是福建主要木材产区之一。中共建瓯县委历来十分重视木材生产，在大抓木材生产中，实行统一部署、统一包干任务和统一检查。除县委第一书记定时抓、一个书记专门管外，各公社、大队也有一个书记或社长、队长专管木材生产。全县早在去年秋收后即抓紧农事稍闲的有利时机，发动群众大量砍伐，到春节前就已伐木六十二万立方米，为今年到材创造了物质基础。为了提前超额完成全年送材到材任务，广大运材工人也在各级党委领导下，不断同干旱洪涝等自然灾害作斗争。今春久旱不雨，溪河枯浅，各公社社员、国营伐木场职工就在小溪上筑坝蓄水，修建各种坝八千多座，大大提高了溪河水位，顺利进行木材流送工作。5、6月份雨量较多，溪河水位上涨，广大职工和社员又在县委领导下，大搞乘洪水运木材，保证全年送材到材任务提前超额完成。
