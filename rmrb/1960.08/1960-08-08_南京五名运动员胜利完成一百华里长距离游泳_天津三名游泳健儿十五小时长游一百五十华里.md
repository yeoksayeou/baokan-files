    南京五名运动员胜利完成一百华里长距离游泳  天津三名游泳健儿十五小时长游一百五十华里
    新华社南京7日电　南京市优秀运动员夏令营游泳队的四名男运动员和一名女运动员，今天胜利地完成了在长江中由马鞍山到南京一百华里的长距离游泳。这四名男运动员是南京工学院的学生李延江、王延平、夏顺林和南京市第十三中学学生石波；女运动员是南京市第四中学十七岁的华侨学生李雪芳。他们之中，年龄最大的是二十三岁。
    上午七时十分，五位运动员在安徽省马鞍山市第八号码头跃入长江，下午一时十八分李延江第一个到达了南京中山码头。他是以六小时零八分的时间游完了一百华里。王延平比李延江慢十二分钟到达目的地。夏顺林和石波都是花了六小时三十五分钟游完这段距离。最后到达的女运动员李雪芳，也只用了七小时十分游完了一百华里的全程。
    今天恰逢大潮汛，江面上刮着五级东南风，一两尺高的迎面大浪层层涌来，年轻勇敢的游泳运动员们顽强地和风浪搏斗。每个运动员在途中共饮用了五百——八百毫升桔子汁，中途没有靠岸也没有上船休息。
    据新华社天津7日电　天津市三名青年游泳运动员在6日创造了用十五小时零五分钟的时间，连续长游一百五十华里的优异成绩。
    这三名青年游泳运动员是天津市第四游泳池救护员、二十岁的董玉芝，第十中学高中一年级学生、十九岁的秦法鸿，第三十五中学高中一年级学生、十八岁的黄维敬。他们都是河北区业余体育学校的学员，从小就爱好游泳。
    6日凌晨一时正，在距天津市一百多华里的静海县的子牙河边上，这三名游泳健儿，同时跳入水中开始了顽强的“马拉松”长游。到下午四点零五分，三位健儿终于游到了海河市区中心广场，胜利登岸，完成了长游一百五十华里的光荣任务。
    在整个游泳过程中，三名游泳运动员每三小时在水中吃一次饭，并由医生为他们检查脉搏、心脏和血压，证明健康情况良好。
