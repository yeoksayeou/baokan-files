Singing of the New Life of Our Mulam People
Mulam Nationality, Bao Yutang

I am a young man of the Mulam nationality. In recent years, under the Party's kind care, education, and cultivation, I have been learning to write. I often cannot suppress my excitement when I think that a naive young man from a minority nationality who has only studied for three or four years can now learn to write folk songs and come to the capital to participate in the Literary and Art Congress. This is something I never dared to dream of in the past. In this moment of excitement, I have so much to say! But where should I begin?

Speaking of myself, I will think of my nation – the Mulam working people.

My nationality is a minority group in the mountainous areas of northern Guangxi, with a population of just over 50,000. Under the long-term dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Mulam people suffered discrimination, oppression, and exploitation, living a life of unbearable suffering. They often sang with tears in their eyes:

	It's hard, it's hard,
	No oxen, people are used to plow the fields;
	A year yields three baskets of grain,
	The landlord eats rice, I eat chaff.

At that time, the Kuomintang government also conscripted soldiers, laborers, grain, and taxes every day. The people's marrow was squeezed dry, and they angrily complained:

	Year 35 of the Republic of China, the people suffer greatly;
	Year 36 of the Republic of China, the people are cooked in one pot…

In such living conditions, working people simply could not go to school and receive education. Therefore, more than 90% were illiterate.

Because they could not bear oppression and exploitation, the Mulam people had long been resisting the ruling class, with "a rebellion every three years." The ruling class also conducted cruel suppression, "a small scrape every three years, a large scrape every five years." Because there was no Party leadership, the Mulam people's rebellions all tragically failed.

In 1946, the Party carried out underground revolutionary activities in the Mulam area; on November 23, 1949, the first five-star red flag was planted on Phoenix Mountain. Since then, the Mulam people ended their arduous journey and began a new and glorious chapter in history.

After liberation, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line and ethnic policies, the Mulam people, together with the people of all nationalities in the country, carried out a series of social reforms and entered the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The impoverished and declining face of the past has been fundamentally changed. Shimen Commune, which used to lack more than 600,000 catties of grain every year, has now become a surplus grain area selling more than 400,000 catties of surplus grain annually. Industry, a blank spot in the history of our nationality, increased greatly after the Great Leap Forward, with the total industrial output value of Luocheng County, where the Mulam people live in concentrated communities, increasing to 610,000 yuan in 1958. In the past, culture was extremely backward, but now primary school education has been basically universalized.

All of this has been achieved under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. It is the Party that brought spring to the Mulam people; the Party is the sun of the Mulam people!

My father worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord for more than ten years, and my mother was the daughter of a coal miner. When I was a child, because of poverty in my family, I did not have the opportunity to go to school and had been working at home. Later, with the help of my aunt and uncle, I entered the Kuomintang school. In school, the children of working people were bullied everywhere. The rich grabbed your ears and scolded you as a "low-class brat!" They broke the flowers and trees in the school and falsely accused me of damaging them. The principal, without distinguishing right from wrong, gave me a major demerit.

After liberation, I, like a little fish that rejoices in the spring water, threw myself into the embrace of the revolution. In the past ten years, under the care and cultivation of the Party, I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China; from a young man of a minority nationality with a low level of education, I have grown into a Party literary and art worker. Whenever I think of my past and look at my present, I can't help but shout from the bottom of my heart: It is the Party that gave me a new life! The Party is my reborn parents!

In the autumn of 1950, when the suppression of bandits was at its most intense, I was sent home from the cadre school to recuperate because of an injury to my left foot. With my injury, I started a night school in the village. Everyone hated the village bandit leader Wu Dairang very much, so I composed several songs for the masses to sing, which enlightened the masses.

Wu Dairang was captured alive. He said that when he hid in the mountains behind the village every night and heard the angry songs of the masses, he was so scared that he cried.

The district party secretary found out and encouraged me, saying: "Your folk songs, like bullets, can strike the enemy. Compose more and let the masses sing them!"

In 1952, I was responsible for propaganda work in a land reform team. At first, some of the masses could not be mobilized, so our propaganda team collected the crimes of the landlords and composed them into folk songs to sing everywhere.

The songs of the propaganda team ignited the flames of anger among the masses. Women who had been raped and relatives of those who had been killed shouted out a cry of "revenge."

At that time, I didn't know what art was, but in fact, I was already using it to fight the enemy. Later, I often cooperated with the central work of the Party and composed some folk songs for the masses to sing. The editorial department of the Party newspaper knew about it and often took some folk songs they thought were good to publish in the newspaper. Encouraged by them, I gradually learned to use a pen to write down the folk songs and send them to the newspaper for publication. But it was not until after 1956 that I consciously and regularly engaged in amateur literary and artistic creation.

During this period, the Mulam people, under the leadership of the Party, successfully carried out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. Then, they launched a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in socialist construction and realized the people's commune, achieving great achievements in all walks of life. Our hometown presented an unprecedented prosperous scene.

Life and the times themselves are great poems!

In my hometown, there is an old Maoling Pass. The ancients sang:

	Old Maoling Pass,
	A small stone road leads to the sky;
	Whoever walks through Old Maoling Pass,
	If they don't die, they will become consumptive.

After the commune, a road was built here and cars could pass through. How amazing! I could not restrain the joy in my heart and composed a new song:…………

	Now taking a car to Tianhe,
	Singing folk songs above the white clouds;
	The people's commune has great strength,
	What can high mountains and ridges do to me!

In this way, in the past few years, I have intermittently learned to write three long poems, more than one hundred short poems, and more than twenty prose pieces, praising the people's commune, praising the Great Leap Forward, praising the Party and Chairman Mao, praising the new life of our Mulam nationality, and praising our socialist construction.

I have personally experienced two eras. I know in my heart who our relatives are and who our enemies are. I also deeply understand that defending the Party is defending socialism and defending the happy life of all our nationalities.

    歌唱我们仫佬族的新生
    仫佬族　包玉堂
    我是一个仫佬族青年，几年来，在党的亲切关怀和教育培养下，学习写作。我常常压抑不住激动的心情，想着一个仅读过三、四年书的幼稚的少数民族青年，今天能够学会写山歌，能够到首都来参加文代大会，这是我过去做梦也不敢想到的。在这激动的时候，我有多少话要说呵！可是，从哪里说起呢？
    说到我自己，我就会想起我的民族——仫佬族劳动人民。
    我的民族，是广西北部山区里的一个少数民族，仅有五万多人口。在国民党反动派长期的黑暗统治下，仫佬族人民受尽了歧视、压迫和剥削，过着痛苦不堪的生活，他们常常含着眼泪唱道：
    难了难，
    无牛拿人去犁田；
    一年收得三箩谷，
    财主吃米我吃糠。
    那时，国民党政府还要天天征兵征伕，征粮征税。人民的骨髓都榨干了，他们愤怒地诉说：
    民国三十五，百姓苦中苦；
    民国三十六，百姓一锅熟……
    在这样的生活情况下，劳动人民根本谈不上进学校，受教育。所以，90％以上是文盲。
    由于不堪受压迫和剥削，仫佬族人民长期以来一直对统治阶级进行着反抗斗争，“三年必反乱一场”。统治阶级也“三年一小刮，五年一大刮”，进行残酷的镇压。由于没有党的领导，仫佬族人民历次的反抗斗争都悲壮地失败了。
    1946年，党在仫佬族地区开展了地下革命活动；1949年11月23日，第一面五星红旗插上了凤凰山。从此仫佬族人民结束了苦难的历程，开始了新的光辉的史页。
    解放后，在党的总路线和民族政策的光辉照耀下，仫佬族人民和全国各族人民一道，进行了一系列的社会改革，进入了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，过去那贫困衰落的面貌，已经基本改变了。从前年年缺粮六十多万斤的石门公社，如今变成年卖余粮四十多万斤的余粮区。工业，在我们民族的历史上，是一个白点，大跃进以后，全民大办工业，1958年仫佬族聚居的罗城县工业总产值即增加到六十一万元。过去文化极端落后，如今，已经基本普及了小学教育。
    所有这一切，都是在党和毛主席英明领导下取得的。是党，给仫佬族人民带来了春天，党，是仫佬族人民的太阳！
    我的父亲给地主当了十多年的长工，母亲是个煤矿工人的女儿。我小时候，由于家庭生活贫困，没有机会上学，一直在家里劳动，后来在姑姑和舅舅的帮助下，我进了国民党的学校。在学校里，劳动人民的子弟处处受欺侮，有钱人揪着你的耳朵，骂你是“?狫崽！”他们把学校花木折断了，诬告是我弄坏的，校长不分青红皂白，便记了我一个大过。
    解放了，我像一条喜得春水的小鱼，投入了革命的怀抱。十年来，在党的关怀培养下，我光荣地参加了中国共产党；由一个文化水平很低的少数民族青年，成长为一个党的文艺工作者。每当想起自己的过去，看看自己的现在，我就禁不住从心里喊出：是党呵，使我获得了新的生命！党，是我的再生爹娘！
    1950年秋，正是剿匪斗争最激烈的时候，我在干校因左脚受伤被送回家休养。我带着伤，在村里办起了一个夜学班。大家对村里的匪首吴代让非常仇恨，于是我编了几首歌让群众唱，启发了群众的觉悟。
    吴代让被活捉了。他说：当他每天晚上躲在村后山上，听到群众的愤怒的歌声时，害怕得哭起来。
    区委书记知道了，鼓励我说：“你们的山歌和子弹一样，可以打击敌人，多编一些让群众唱吧！”
    1952年，我在一个土改分队里负责宣传工作。起先，有些群众发动不起来，我们宣传队便搜集地主的罪恶，编成山歌到处唱。
    宣传队的歌声，点燃了群众愤怒的火焰，被奸污的妇女，被杀害者的亲属，喊出了一片“报仇”的呼声。
    那时，我还不知道什么叫文艺，但实际上已经在用它同敌人作斗争了。以后，便经常配合党的中心工作，编些山歌让群众唱，党报编辑部知道了，常把他们认为好的一些山歌拿到报上去刊登。在他们的鼓舞下，我也渐渐地学会用笔把山歌写下来，寄给报社发表了。但真正有意识地经常进行业余文艺创作，还是1956年以后的事。
    这一个时期，在党领导下的仫佬族人民，胜利地进行了政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命，接着，又掀起了社会主义建设全面大跃进，实现了人民公社化，各行各业，都取得了伟大的成就，我们的家乡呈现一片空前繁荣的景象。
    生活和时代本身，就是伟大的诗篇！
    在我的家乡，有座古毛?，古人有歌唱道：
    古毛?，
    小小石路通天高；
    谁人走过古毛?，
    回来不死也成痨。
    公社化以后，这里修起了公路，通了汽车，多么了不起呀！我止不住内心的喜悦，编了一首新歌：…………
    如今坐车上天河，
    白云上面唱山歌；
    人民公社力量大，
    高山大岭奈我何！
    就是这样，几年来，我断断续续学写了三首长诗，一百多首短诗和二十多篇散文，歌颂人民公社，歌颂大跃进，歌颂党和毛主席，歌颂我们仫佬族的新生，歌颂我们的社会主义建设。
    我亲身经历过两个时代，我心里知道：谁是我们的亲人，谁是我们的敌人。我更深深地懂得：捍卫党，就是捍卫社会主义，捍卫我们全国各族人民的幸福生活。
