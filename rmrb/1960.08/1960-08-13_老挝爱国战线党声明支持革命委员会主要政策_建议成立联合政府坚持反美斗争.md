Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 12th: The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on August 9th regarding the current situation in Laos, expressing support for the coup launched by the Revolutionary Committee and its announced main policy stances, and put forward several suggestions concerning the Lao people's cause of national salvation. The full text of the statement, published in the same day's "Lao Patriotic News," is as follows:

The Revolutionary Committee, headed by Captain Kong Le, staged a coup on August 9th, overthrowing the government of Chao Sisouk Na Champassak-Phoumi Nosavan, the henchmen of U.S. imperialism.

According to Vientiane Radio, the Revolutionary Committee issued a statement saying that the purpose of the coup was to defend the country, religion, the King, and the Constitution, to oppose U.S. imperialist intervention, to stop the civil war, to implement national reconciliation, to respect the agreements concluded by the Kingdom of Laos, and to achieve a genuine policy of peace and neutrality.

The above-mentioned events are of great significance to the situation in Laos and Indochina. They prove that the Lao people's long-term, unremitting, and heroic anti-U.S. and national salvation struggle, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, has powerfully stimulated the national spirit of people from all walks of life, even officers and soldiers of the Royal Army. This is a victory for the line of struggle for national independence and peaceful neutrality, which is in line with the earnest wishes of all the people of our country, and it is also another new and heavy defeat for U.S. imperialism, following its heavy defeats in Korea, Turkey, and Japan.

The coup launched in Vientiane by the Revolutionary Committee with the above-mentioned objectives is part of the anti-U.S. and national salvation movement that is growing stronger in our country.

The Lao Patriotic Front, which has always been loyal to the sacred rights of the motherland and the people, solemnly declares:

(1) Fully support the coup and Captain Kong Le, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee's statements and the main policy stances in the second and fourth communiques issued on August 9th.

(2) The Lao Patriotic Front is ready at any time to contact and negotiate with the Revolutionary Committee or the government that will be established to ensure the implementation of the policy line that the Revolutionary Committee has announced, in order to quickly resolve the current chaotic situation in the country, restore peace, and implement national reconciliation.

Faced with the national salvation movement of all the people of our country, especially faced with the new situation created by the coup, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in our country are becoming frantic, and they are promoting dangerous conspiracies aimed at restoring their original position and continuing to maintain their privileges.

At this critical moment, in order to ensure that the people's cause of national salvation in our country achieves good results, the Lao Patriotic Front suggests:

(1) A national coalition government should be quickly established, including representatives from all ethnic groups and patriotic and progressive parties, to implement the policy stances put forward by the Revolutionary Committee and stabilize the national situation.

(2) Promote the development of the coup movement to various provinces, punish the henchmen of U.S. imperialism, and do not allow them to gather to counterattack the Revolutionary Committee and regain their power. The forces of the Revolutionary Committee and the Lao Fighting Forces should take joint action to jointly oppose the U.S. imperialist interventionist conspiracy and the restoration conspiracy of pro-American elements.

(3) Promulgate some specific policies to guarantee the democratic freedom rights of the people, release all patriotic and peace-loving people who have been illegally imprisoned by previous reactionary governments, guarantee the rights of free activity for all patriotic political parties, including the Lao Patriotic Front and the Peace and Neutrality Committee, and improve the people's lives.

The soldiers and people rising up to overthrow the traitorous government of Chao Sisouk Na Champassak-Phoumi Nosavan is an internal affair of the Lao nation, and no foreign country has the right to interfere in any form. If U.S. imperialism interferes to put its lackeys back in power, then the Lao people will unite closely and wage a resolute struggle against them, while calling on all peace-loving countries in the world to provide support.

The Lao Patriotic Front has always advocated unity with all patriotic political parties and people to eliminate pro-American elements, to make the motherland completely independent and free, and to make the Lao people happy and free. Compatriots across the country:

For many years, the people of our country have suffered from the pain and misery caused by the vicious conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary traitorous cliques. For the survival of the nation and for the supreme interests of the motherland, the people of our country have carried out heroic struggles with deep patriotism and a profound hatred of U.S. imperialism, and have achieved continuous victories.

The Revolutionary Committee, headed by Captain Kong Le, staging a coup to overthrow the traitorous government of Chao Sisouk Na Champassak-Phoumi Nosavan, is an important contribution to the national salvation movement against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. This action has created a good opportunity for all the Lao people to unite more closely to defeat the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism.

The Lao Patriotic Front earnestly calls on all officers, soldiers, and police across the country to strengthen their patriotism against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, resolutely implement all the orders and instructions of the Revolutionary Committee, and never be deceived by the Chao Sisouk Na Champassak-Phoumi Nosavan clique, never carry out their orders, and never attack the soldiers and people who have risen up in Vientiane.

The Lao Patriotic Front earnestly calls on all compatriots in rural and urban areas, farmers, workers, staff, soldiers, police, and all patriotic and progressive parties to work together to support the policies of the Revolutionary Committee, smash all new conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and concentrate all efforts and possibilities to build our beloved Laos into a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous country.

The Lao Patriotic Front hopes that the Revolutionary Committee will be faithful to the propositions and policies it has announced and not disappoint the expectations of the Lao people.

The Lao Patriotic Front calls on the peace-loving people of the world to actively support the just struggle of the Lao people.

                                The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front
                                            August 9, 1960

    老挝爱国战线党声明支持革命委员会主要政策
    建议成立联合政府坚持反美斗争
    呼吁爱国力量起来清除亲美分子建立和平中立独立民主统一和繁荣的国家
    希望革命委员会忠诚于它所公布的主张和政策不要辜负了老挝人民的期待
    新华社河内12日电　老挝爱国战线党中央委员会在8月9日就老挝当前局势发表声明，表示支持革命委员会发动的政变和它所宣布的主要政策主张，并且提出了有关老挝人民救国事业的几项建议。刊载在同一天出版的“老挝爱国新闻”上的这项声明全文如下：
    以贡勒大尉为首的革命委员会8月9日举行政变，推翻了美帝国主义的得力走狗昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万政府。
    据万象电台广播，革命委员会发表声明说，政变的目的是保卫祖国、宗教、国王、宪法，反对美帝国主义的干涉，停止内战，实行民族和睦，尊重老挝王国所缔结的协议，实现真正的和平中立政策。
    上述事件，对老挝局势和印度支那局势具有非常重要的意义。它证明，老挝人民在老挝爱国战线党领导下长久以来不懈地、英勇地进行的反美救国斗争，强有力地激发了各阶层人民、甚至王国军队的军官和士兵们的民族精神。这是符合我国全体人民的殷切愿望的为民族独立和和平中立而斗争的路线的胜利，同时是美帝国主义继它在朝鲜、土耳其、日本的沉重失败之后的又一次新的沉重失败。
    由革命委员会本着上述目的在万象发动的政变，是我国人民正在越来越壮大地发展的反美救国运动的一部分。
    一贯忠诚于祖国和人民的神圣权利的老挝爱国战线党，谨郑重声明：
    （一）完全支持政变和革命委员会主席贡勒大尉的各项声明和8月9日发表的第二、第四号公报中的主要政策主张。
    （二）老挝爱国战线党随时准备同革命委员会或将要成立的保证实现革命委员会曾经宣布的政策路线的政府进行接触和谈判，以迅速解决国家当前的混乱局势，恢复安宁，实行民族和睦。
    面对我国全体人民的救国运动特别是面对由政变所产生的新局势，美帝国主义和它在我国的走狗正在变得疯狂起来，它们正在促进旨在恢复它们原有的地位和继续维持它们的特权的危险阴谋。
    在这严重时刻，为了保证我国人民的救国事业取得美好结果，老挝爱国战线党建议：
    （一）迅速成立民族联合政府，包括各民族和各爱国进步党派的代表，以实现革命委员会所提出的政策主张并稳定全国局势。
    （二）促使政变运动向各省发展，惩办美帝国主义的得力走狗，不允许它们聚集起来反攻革命委员会和夺回它们的权势，革命委员会的力量和寮国战斗部队的力量采取联合行动，共同反对美帝国主义的干涉阴谋和亲美分子的复辟阴谋。
    （三）颁布一些具体政策，以保障人民的民主自由权利，释放所有被历届反动政府非法监禁的爱国、爱和平人士，保障各爱国政党，其中包括老挝爱国战线党和和平中立委员会的自由活动的权利，改善人民的生活。
    士兵和人民起来推翻昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万卖国政府，是老挝民族的内部事务，任何外国绝对没有权利在任何形式下加以干涉。如果美帝国主义实行干涉，要重新让它的走狗上台执政，那么，老挝人民将紧密团结，为反对它们而进行坚决的斗争，同时呼吁世界上所有爱好和平的国家给予支持。
    老挝爱国战线党一贯主张同所有爱国政党和人士团结，清除亲美分子，使祖国完全独立和自由，老挝人民幸福和自由。全体同胞们：
    多少年来我国人民饱受了由美帝国主义和反动卖国集团的恶毒阴谋制造出来的痛苦和悲惨遭遇。为了民族的生存，为了祖国的最高利益，我国人民以深厚的爱国主义和对美帝国主义的深刻的仇恨进行了英勇的斗争，并取得了不断的胜利。
    以贡勒大尉为首的革命委员会举行政变推翻昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万卖国政府这件事，是对反对美帝国主义及其走狗的救国运动的重要贡献。这个行动为全体老挝人民更密切地团结起来，打退美帝国主义的阴谋，创造了良好的时机。
    老挝爱国战线党恳切号召全国的全体官兵和警察加强反对美帝国主义及其走狗的爱国心，坚决执行革命委员会的一切命令和指示，绝不受昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万集团的欺骗，绝不执行它们的命令，绝不去进攻在万象起义的士兵和人民。
    老挝爱国战线党恳切号召农村和城市全体同胞，农民，工人，职员，士兵，警察，各爱国和进步党派同心协力支持革命委员会的政策，粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的一切新的阴谋，集中一切力量和可能把我们亲爱的老挝建设成一个和平中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的国家。
    老挝爱国战线党希望革命委员会将忠诚于它所公布的主张和政策，不要辜负老挝人民的期待。
    老挝爱国战线党呼吁世界爱好和平人民积极支持老挝人民的正义斗争。
                                老挝爱国战线党中央委员会
                                            1960年8月9日
