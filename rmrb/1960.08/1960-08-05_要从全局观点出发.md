    We Must Proceed From a Global Perspective
    Xu Bingdao, Secretary of the Party Branch of Shangtang Brigade, Yuecheng Commune, Jiangyin County
    Over the past two years, Shangtang Brigade has implemented the Party's policy of "taking grain as the key link and making overall arrangements," and has achieved a bumper harvest of grain. With a bumper harvest of grain, we have grasped the initiative. Once we have the initiative, we have everything. We have not only overfulfilled the state's grain purchase quota, but also left enough grain for the commune members' food, seeds, and fodder. "When the big river rises, the small ponds are full." The income of the commune members increased by 26.1% in 1959 compared with 1958, and the public accumulation of the brigade increased by 118%. With more grain, there are more pigs. The number of pigs in sties in 1959 increased by 64% compared with 1958, further promoting the all-round development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.
    Although we have achieved great success in implementing the policy of "taking grain as the key link," it has not been smooth sailing. This year, during the summer planting season, there was still a struggle between two ideas regarding the sown area of crops. Most people advocated that the existing 37 mu of economic crop fields, which were originally planted with rice, should be restored to rice cultivation, and the economic crops should be moved to the gaps along the riverbanks. They also advocated expanding the rice planting area by leveling land and converting dry land into paddy fields, and striving to harvest more grain by all means. However, a few people disagreed, believing that changing the existing economic crop area to rice would reduce income. They thought it was "a clever person making a stupid calculation," arguing that planting celery, arrowhead, etc. on dozens of mu of rice fields was "irrelevant to the overall situation." If ideas are not unified, the implementation of the policy of "taking grain as the key link" will be hindered. Therefore, the Party branch organized cadres and the masses to start a discussion. In the discussion, everyone, through recalling and comparing, realized that in the past, Shangtang Brigade had always emphasized sideline occupations over agriculture, and had to rely on the state to sell grain every year. Since the Great Leap Forward, the implementation of the policy of "taking grain as the key link" has greatly changed the situation, and a new situation of "grain taking the lead, and all industries galloping forward" has emerged. The lives of the commune members have been greatly improved, and their enthusiasm for production is high. Implementing the policy of "taking grain as the key link" is not only good for the commune members and the commune, but also makes a great contribution to the country, because with the development of socialist construction, the country's need for commodity grain is also growing day by day. Our resolute implementation of the policy of "taking grain as the key link" is to first ensure the needs of national construction and people's lives in terms of grain, which is a concrete implementation of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation. So this is a big calculation, a clever calculation. On the contrary, focusing solely on economic income, reducing the rice planting area, and planting more economic crops is only considering the interests of individuals and small collectives, and disregarding the interests of the state and the large collective, only seeing the immediate interests, and not seeing the long-term interests. This is a small calculation, a stupid calculation. Is it "irrelevant to the overall situation" to use dozens of mu of rice fields to develop sideline occupations? Everyone calculated an account. If each mu of rice field produces 600 jin of grain, then 37 mu in our brigade would produce more than 22,000 jin. According to this figure, the 19 brigades in the entire commune would harvest more than 420,000 jin less grain. From the perspective of the entire county, the number would be even more astonishing. We must proceed from the perspective of "the whole country as one chessboard" and strive to plant more, harvest more, and achieve high yields and more harvests. If we think that we are already self-sufficient and that planting a little less is "irrelevant to the overall situation," in fact, it is affecting the overall situation of "the whole country as one chessboard." Those who say "irrelevant to the overall situation" are treating the interests of a part as the "overall situation." They have not seen that the interests of the state are the real overall situation. They have also not seen that if the overall situation of the country is affected, the interests of the "small part" will not be guaranteed.
    Through discussion, everyone broadened their horizons, and their thinking was unified, realizing that it is right to make a big calculation. Once thoughts are unified, methods will come. We transplanted the economic crops originally planned to be planted on the 37 mu of rice fields to the gaps along the riverbanks. By tapping the potential, the planting area not only did not decrease, but also increased by 12 mu, and it is estimated that the income will increase by 35% compared with last year. We also overcame many difficulties and planted crops in the rice fields that were converted from dry land after land leveling, and installed waterwheels to ensure that the rice seedlings are well watered. Now they are growing lush green.
    We deeply realize that "listening to the Party is never wrong." In the future, we will work more steadily, work hard, and resolutely implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, and strive for an all-round Great Leap Forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries with grain as the center.

### 要从全局观点出发

    要从全局观点出发	中共江阴县月城公社上塘大队支部书记　徐炳道
    上塘大队两年来执行了党的“以粮为纲、全面安排”的方针，获得了粮食丰收。粮食丰收了，就掌握了主动权。一主动，百主动，我们不仅超额完成了国家粮食征购任务，而且留足了社员口粮、种子和饲料。“大河水涨，小塘水满”，社员收入1959年比1958年增加26.1％，大队公共积累增加118％；粮多猪多，1959年生猪圈存数比1958年增加64％；进一步促进了林、牧、副、渔的全面发展。
    我们贯彻执行“以粮为纲”的方针虽然取得了很大成绩，但是并不是一帆风顺的。今年夏种在作物播种面积上，就还有两种思想的斗争。大多数人主张把现有三十七亩原来种水稻的经济作物田，仍然恢复种水稻，把经济作物移到河边隙地上去；并利用平整土地、旱改水等方法，扩大水稻面积，千方百计争取多收粮食。可是有少数人不同意，认为把现有经济作物面积改种水稻，会减少收入，是“聪明人打笨算盘”，拿几十亩稻田种种芹菜、茨菇……无关大局。思想不统一，贯彻执行“以粮为纲”的方针就要受到阻力，于是支部就组织干部群众展开了讨论。在讨论中，大家从回忆对比中，认识到过去上塘大队由于一贯重副轻农，年年要国家统销粮食；大跃进以来，贯彻执行了“以粮为纲”的方针，面貌才大变样，出现了“粮帅一马当先，各业万马奔腾”的新局面，社员生活大改善，生产劲头十足。贯彻执行“以粮为纲”的方针不但对社员、公社有好处，而且对国家的贡献也大，因为随着社会主义建设事业一天天的发展，国家对商品粮食的需要也一天天增长。我们坚决贯彻执行“以粮为纲”的方针，就是首先在粮食上保证国家建设和人民生活的需要，就是具体地贯彻执行了以农业为基础的方针。所以这是打的大算盘，聪明算盘。相反，单纯从经济收入着眼，缩减水稻面积，多种经济作物，这是只顾个人和小集体利益，不顾国家大集体利益，只看到眼前利益，没有看到长远利益。这是打的小算盘，笨算盘。拿出几十亩水稻田发展副业，是不是“无关大局”？大家算了一笔账，每亩稻田生产粮食以六百斤计算，我们大队三十七亩就是二万二千多斤。按这个数字推算，全公社十九个大队，就要少收粮食四十二万多斤；从全县来看，数字就更大得惊人。我们要从“全国一盘棋”出发，应该力争多种多收、高产多收，如果认为我们自己已经自给有余，少种一点“无关大局”，实际上，正是影响了“全国一盘棋”的大局，说“无关大局”的人，他们是把局部的利益看作“大局”，他们没有看到国家利益才是真正的大局。他们也没有看到国家大局受到影响，“小局”的利益也就得不到保障。
    通过讨论，大家扩大了眼界，思想上一致认识到要打大算盘才对头。思想统一了，方法也就来了。我们把原计划在三十七亩水稻田种的经济作物，移种到河边隙地上，潜力一挖，种植面积不但没有减少，而且增加了十二亩，估计收入可比去年增加35％。平整土地以后旱改水的稻田，我们也克服许多困难，种上了庄稼，并且装上水车，保证稻苗喝足喝饱，现在长得一片葱绿。
    我们深刻的体会到，“听党的话不会错”。今后，我们更要踏踏实实，埋头苦干，坚决贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针，争取以粮食为中心的农、林、牧、副、渔全面大跃进。
