Saving National Construction Funds, Reducing Patients' Medical Expenses
Xingtai Hospital Sets a Model of Diligence and Frugality in Running the Hospital
    (Our report) Xingtai First Hospital conscientiously implements the instructions of the Party committee and has consistently implemented the policy of running the hospital diligently and frugally for twelve years, achieving great results. In 1959 alone, they saved the state expenditures of 10,600 yuan, accounting for 18.8% of all public funds. Since 1960, the hospital has launched an increase production and conservation campaign centered on technological innovation and revolution. In the first quarter alone, it saved expenditure of 9,160 yuan, accounting for 42.5% of the total public funds. They have independently purchased medical equipment worth more than 27,000 yuan, such as ambulances, refrigerators, drying ovens, and photoelectric colorimeters. In order to reduce the burden on patients, the hospital has reduced drug prices twice. Starting in January 1960, the registration fee was also reduced from 1 jiao to 5 fen per person, and a free examination system for pregnant women was implemented. After the implementation of these measures, the burden on patients has been reduced by an average of 25.8%, setting a brilliant example for various cultural and educational units in Xingtai County in running their undertakings diligently and frugally. Not long ago, the County People's Committee held an on-site meeting to promote the experience of this hospital.
    Xingtai First Hospital has a variety of measures for running the hospital diligently and frugally, which can be summarized as "seven uses" and "six no's". That is: clear the warehouse, revitalize dead objects; make medicines by yourself, store and save them properly; do it yourself to reduce costs; do not leak a drop, make the most of everything; make full use of everything in a simple way; be versatile and use one person for multiple purposes; innovate technology and use waste products. In terms of the use and management of goods: planned purchases without backlog, moisture-proof and rain-proof without mildew, prescriptions according to the disease without waste, proper storage without loss, daily clearing and monthly settlement without errors, and regular inspection without failure. The implementation of these measures has played a significant role in tapping the potential of equipment, improving the efficiency of drug and material use, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of every employee. The hospital director and the branch secretary often personally took the lead in going to the countryside to collect herbs and make more than 70 kinds of medicines by themselves. Nurses and administrative staff, encouraged by the slogan "Sewing, washing, dismantling, and repairing are all done by ourselves, determined not to spend money, increase production and save more, and strive to turn poor hospitals into rich hospitals," have since 1960, dismantled and washed quilts, sheets, pillows, etc. in the wards, totaling 6,190 pieces, saving an expenditure of 767 yuan. Cotton balls, gauze, bandages, and ropes are disinfected and reused. Even the medicine wrapping paper and medicine instructions are reused several times within the possible scope, truly achieving not leaking a drop and making the most of everything. In order to expand the scope of medical treatment and accommodate more patients, at the end of 1959, the hospital party branch issued a call to all hospital employees to vacate rooms and donate beds. The director and the branch secretary took the lead in moving to the collective dormitory, and all comrades responded enthusiastically. In a short period of seven days, 50 beds were added, which to a certain extent solved the difficulty of insufficient beds. After the expansion of beds, the next problem was the lack of personnel. After everyone's discussion, they unanimously stated that they would not ask the state for personnel, but would solve it themselves. Thus, the movement of "one employee becoming multiple employees, striving to be all-rounders" quickly swept the entire hospital.
    The reason why these diligent and frugal hospital management activities can be maintained for a long time is that, under the leadership of the party branch, everyone has the revolutionary ambition to strive for self-improvement, work hard, and strive for the top. In order to make the activities of running the hospital diligently and frugally continue to develop, they often carry out red flag competitions between departments and between people to compare financial management, waste utilization, love of public property, and technological innovation, establish red flags and continuously leap forward.

    The Shanghai Children's Hospital Branch, in order to support the rapid development and improvement of the early childhood education in the streets and neighborhoods, started from scratch and established an amateur nursery nurse school specializing in training nursery staff. When there were not enough classrooms, they used the spare time of classrooms in nearby schools to attend classes.

### 节约国家建设资金　减轻患者医药费用  邢台医院树立勤俭办院榜样

    节约国家建设资金　减轻患者医药费用
    邢台医院树立勤俭办院榜样
    本报讯　邢台第一医院认真贯彻党委指示，十二年如一日，坚持贯彻勤俭办院方针，取得了很大成绩。仅1959年，他们就为国家节约开支一万零六百元，占全部公用经费的18.8％。1960年以来，这个医院又开展了以技术革新、技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，第一季度就节约经费开支九千一百六十元，占公用经费总额的42.5％。他们自力更生购置了救护汽车、电冰箱、干燥箱、电光比色计等价值二万七千多元的医疗设备。为了减轻患者的负担，医院先后两次降低药费价格，从1960年1月份起，挂号收费也由每人一角降为五分，并实行了孕妇免费检查制度。实施这些办法后，病患者的负担平均降低了25.8％，为邢台县各文教单位勤俭办事业树立了光辉榜样。不久前，县人民委员会召开现场会议，推广了这个医院的经验。
    邢台第一医院勤俭办院的措施是多种多样的，综合起来可称之为“七用”、“六无”。这就是：清理仓库，死物活用；自制药品，妥存节用；自己动手，减少费用；点滴不漏，物尽其用；因陋就简，充分利用；一专多能，一人多用；革新技术，废品利用。在物品的使用和管理方面是：计划采购无积压，防潮防雨无霉烂，按病开药无浪费，妥善保管无损耗，日清月结无差错，经常检查无失效。这些措施的实现，对于挖掘设备潜力，提高药品和物质的使用效率，调动每个职工的积极性起到了很大的作用。医院院长和支部书记经常亲自带头下乡采药，自制药品达七十多种。护士和行政管理人员在“缝洗拆补自己干，立志不花伸手钱，增产节约多积累，力争穷院变富院”的口号鼓舞下，1960年以来，自己动手拆洗病房被褥、床单、枕头等，累计达六千一百九十件，节约开支七百六十七元。棉球、纱布、绷带、绳经经过消毒后，一用再用，连包药纸、药品说明书在可能范围内也要重用几次，真正做到了点滴不漏，物尽其用。为了扩大医疗范围，更多地收容患者，1959年底医院党支部向全院职工发出了腾房献床的号召，院长和支部书记带头搬到集体宿舍去住，全体同志热烈响应了这一号召。经过短短七天的时间，就扩大病床五十张，在一定程度上解决了病床不足的困难。病床扩大后，接着而来的是人员缺乏问题。经过大家讨论，一致表示不向国家要人，自己来解决，于是，“一员变多员，争当多面手”的运动就迅速在全院范围内掀起来了。
    这些勤俭办院活动所以能够长期坚持下来，是由于他们在党支部的领导下人人有发奋图强，艰苦奋斗，力争上游的革命志气。他们为了使勤俭办院活动持续发展，在科室与科室、人与人之间经常地开展了比财务管理、比废物利用、比爱护公物、比革新技术的红旗竞赛运动，大树红旗，不断跃进。（附图片）
