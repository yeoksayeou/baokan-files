Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 10th: U.S. Secretary of State Herter once again stated at a press conference on the 9th that the United States would use the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization of American States to take further actions to intervene in Cuba. He once again played the trick of fabricating the so-called "communist threat" and declared that "all American countries" must come together at this meeting to discuss the issue of "taking action." He clamored that the current "threat" is "a threat that the charter of the Organization of American States has somewhat anticipated and the Caracas Resolution has definitely anticipated." After publicly stating that he would use these two interventionist tools against Cuba, he demanded that the Latin American countries participating in the meeting be "united" in following the United States' intervention in Cuba.

When a reporter asked Herter about Eisenhower's plan to "aid" Latin American countries, he pointed out that U.S. Senator Mansfield recently said that this plan was "related to the United States' troubles with Cuba" and was a "ruthless attempt to buy goodwill in Latin America at a time when we [referring to the United States] need goodwill."

In answering this question, Herter tried his best to evade the issue, but he was ultimately unable to deny the fact that the United States was attempting to use this plan as bait to lure Latin American countries into participating in the U.S. conspiracy to intervene in Cuba. He admitted that the United States would "mention" this plan at the meeting of American foreign ministers.

Herter admitted that the United States was very concerned about the impact of the Cuban revolution and "its influence in other countries." He angrily attacked Cuba's nationalization of twenty-six American companies.

    赫脱叫嚷要加紧干涉古巴
    公然表示将利用美洲国家组织作侵略工具
    据新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱9日在记者招待会上又一次申明，美国要利用即将召开的美洲国家外长会议来采取进一步干涉古巴的行动。他再一次玩弄捏造的所谓“共产主义威胁”问题，宣称“所有美洲国家”必须在这次会议上一起来讨论“采取行动”的问题。他叫嚷目前的“威胁”是“一种美洲国家组织宪章多少预料到的和加拉加斯决议肯定预料到的威胁”。他在公然表示要使用这两项干涉工具来对付古巴以后，要求参加会议的拉丁美洲国家在追随美国干涉古巴方面“团结一致”。
    有记者在向赫脱提出关于艾森豪威尔的“援助”拉丁美洲国家的计划的问题时指出，美国参议员曼斯菲尔德最近说，这项计划与美国
  “同古巴的麻烦有关”，并且是一种“在我们（指美国）需要好感的时候在拉丁美洲收买好感的无情的企图”。
    赫脱在回答这个问题时，虽然竭力躲闪，但终于无法抵赖美国企图利用这项计划作为诱骗拉丁美洲国家参与美国干涉古巴阴谋的钓饵的事实。他承认，在美洲外长会议上，美国会“提到”这项计划。
    赫脱承认，美国非常担心古巴革命所发生的影响以及“它在其他国家的影响”。他恼羞成怒地攻击古巴把二十六家美国公司收归国有的行动。
