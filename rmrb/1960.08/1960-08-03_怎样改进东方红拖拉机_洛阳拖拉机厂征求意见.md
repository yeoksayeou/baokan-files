    How to Improve the Dongfanghong Tractor
    —Luoyang Tractor Factory Seeks Opinions—
    Since our factory started production last year, we have produced a large number of products. The Dongfanghong-54 horsepower tractor has been put into the battle of agricultural technical transformation in batches, and has been continuously encouraged and praised by state-owned farms, people's commune tractor stations, brother factories, universities, and scientific research institutions. Recently, we have also successfully trial-produced the Dongfanghong-75 horsepower tractor, which has the advantages of high horsepower, fast speed, and low fuel consumption. However, we believe that the current Dongfanghong-54 and Dongfanghong-75 tractors still have some shortcomings in performance, component structure, and other aspects that need to be improved.
    In order to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee to accelerate agricultural technical transformation, and to make our tractors fully adapt to the requirements of China's "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," we hope that everyone will put forward more suggestions for improvement.
    1. What do you think are the main advantages and disadvantages of the Dongfanghong-54 tractor? What problems exist in terms of product quality?
    2. How to improve the service life of tractor parts (such as track shoes, walking parts, etc.)? What is the wear and tear of parts during use?
    3. How to simplify maintenance, adjustment, and repair work? How to improve working conditions (such as improving the cab, reducing operating force, etc.)?
    4. How to further improve the tillage capacity of the Dongfanghong tractor?
    5. How to reduce the weight of parts and components, simplify the structure and process, and save metal materials?
    6. What experience do you have in reducing fuel consumption? What are the results?
    7. How is the crawler tractor utilized annually in your area? How to expand its scope of use, develop comprehensive utilization, and improve utilization rate?
    8. What major variants can the Dongfanghong-75 tractor be modified into (such as four-wheel drive wheeled tractors, etc.)? What are your modification plans?
    9. Among the tractors manufactured domestically and abroad that you use, which tractors have better performance, components, or part structures, and why?
    10. What technical innovations do you have in tractor manufacturing, matching, maintenance, and use, and what are the results?
    We welcome any other suggestions regarding product improvement, whether or not they are mature. We eagerly await your valuable opinions.

    怎样改进东方红拖拉机
    ——洛阳拖拉机厂征求意见——
    我厂从去年开工生产以来，已经生产了大量产品。东方红—54马力拖拉机已经成批地投入农业技术改造的战斗，并且不断地受到各地国营农场、人民公社拖拉机站、兄弟工厂、高等院校、科学研究机关的鼓励和好评。最近，我们又试制成功了东方红—75马力拖拉机，它具有马力大、速度快、油耗低等优点。但是我们认为，目前东方红—54和东方红—75拖拉机在性能、零件结构等方面还有一些缺点需要改进。
    为了响应党中央加速农业技术改造的号召，为了使我们的拖拉机改进得完全适应我国农业“八字宪法”的要求，我们希望大家多多提出改进意见。
    一、你们认为东方红—54拖拉机的主要优缺点是什么？在产品质量方面存在什么问题？
    二、如何提高拖拉机零件的使用寿命（如履带板、行走零件等）？在使用中零件的损耗情况如何？
    三、如何简化保养、调整和维修工作？如何改善劳动条件（如改进驾驶室，减轻操纵力等）？
    四、如何进一步提高东方红拖拉机的耕作能力？
    五、如何减轻零件、部件的重量，简化结构和工艺，节约金属材料？
    六、你们有哪些降低燃料消耗的经验？效果如何？
    七、履带式拖拉机在你们那里每年的利用情况如何？怎样扩大它的使用范围，发展综合利用，提高利用率？
    八、东方红—75拖拉机可以改装哪些主要变型车（如四轮驱动轮式拖拉机等）？你们有何改装的方案？
    九、在你们使用的国内外制造的拖拉机中，有哪些拖拉机的某种性能、某个部件或零件的结构比较好，为什么？
    十、你们有哪些关于拖拉机制配、维修、使用方面的技术革新，效果如何？
    其它任何有关产品改进的建议，不管是否成熟，我们都很欢迎。殷切地期待你们的宝贵意见。
