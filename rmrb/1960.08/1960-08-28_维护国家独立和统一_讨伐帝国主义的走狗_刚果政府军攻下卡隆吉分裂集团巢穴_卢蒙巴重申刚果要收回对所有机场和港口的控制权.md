Xinhua News Agency, August 27th, Elisabethville Dispatch: Three hundred soldiers of the Congolese government captured Bakwanga, the so-called "capital" of the "Mining State of Kasai" controlled by the Kalonji separatist group in Kasai Province, on the morning of the 27th.

The government of the Republic of the Congo has dispatched one thousand soldiers to punish the separatists. In addition to capturing Bakwanga, a city rich in industrial diamonds, they have also recovered some other areas in southern Kasai Province from the Kalonji separatist group, which is supported by imperialism. Currently, Kalonji remains in Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province, colluding with another running dog of imperialism, Tshombe.

It is reported that Congolese government forces are advancing towards Katanga Province, which is controlled by the Tshombe separatist group. Some Congolese soldiers had already arrived at the border between Kasai Province and Katanga Province on the 25th and clashed with the Tshombe group's troops.

News reports state that the Tshombe group is intensifying measures under imperialist manipulation and support, preparing to resist stubbornly.

As previously reported, Tshombe and Kalonji, at the instigation of imperialism, have separately established so-called "republics" in Katanga Province and southern Kasai Province, attempting to split the Congo, undermine Congolese independence and unity, and serve the interests of American, Belgian, British, and French imperialism in these regions.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th, Leopoldville Dispatch: The government of the Republic of the Congo has mobilized one thousand soldiers to the southwestern region of Kasai Province in order to launch an offensive against the Kalonji group, which is attempting to split the Congo.

According to Elisabethville news: Kalonji, chairman of the Congolese National Movement (Kalonji faction), recently announced the establishment of the "Mining State of Kasai" in the southwestern part of Kasai Province, Congo, under imperialist instigation, and proclaimed himself prime minister, echoing Tshombe of Katanga Province. News reports state that Kalonji signed a "treaty" with Katanga separatist Tshombe in Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province, on the 25th, regarding the establishment of a so-called "confederation" between the two regions they control.

News reports state that this "treaty" stipulates that the two so-called "republics" will conduct joint "defense" and establish an economic and customs union.

Tshombe told Agence France-Presse reporters in Elisabethville on the 26th that he had dispatched several companies of Katanga troops to the "Mining State of Kasai" to protect its "capital," Bakwanga.

It is reported that the Tshombe group's troops are still led by Belgian colonial military officers. Approximately one hundred Belgian military police have arrived in Elisabethville under the guise of "technical assistance" to train new recruits for the Tshombe group.

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th, Leopoldville Dispatch: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba said at a press conference on the 26th, "We do not want Belgian occupation to be replaced by another occupation—the occupation of the United Nations." He said, "Once the Belgian troops leave the territory of this republic, we will ask the United Nations to gradually withdraw its troops."

Lumumba reiterated that the Congolese government intends to control all airports and ports in the Congo. He said that the main and only task of the United Nations in the Congo is to make the Belgians withdraw. "The United Nations is not here to occupy our airports, but to make the Belgians withdraw." He condemned UN Under-Secretary-General, American Ralph Bunche, for evading this issue in a letter to him.

The Congolese Prime Minister said that he was anxiously counting the days to see if Hammarskjöld would keep his promise to withdraw the Belgians within eight days. He said, "We will judge the actions of the United Nations in the Congo by this action."

At the press conference, Lumumba also accused Belgian agents and other enemies of the Congo of establishing a headquarters for subversive activities in Brazzaville, the capital of the (former French) Republic of the Congo, plotting a huge conspiracy against his government. He revealed that these conspiracies "have been gladly agreed to by the French authorities."

Referring to the incident on the 25th when some people caused trouble outside the venue of the African Foreign Ministers' Conference, he pointed out that this was "incited by some fascists under the instigation of the Belgian activity network."

Lumumba also condemned the Belgian colonialists for stealing the diamond wealth of Kasai Province in the Congo. He said, "In Kasai Province, some Belgians are organizing riots together with Kalonji because there are diamonds in this province. Some Belgians there are taking advantage of this situation to steal as many diamonds as possible."

He also accused French planes of flying from Brazzaville to Luluabourg in support of Kalonji's conspiracy in Kasai Province. He said, "We have detained an aircraft and the personnel on board."

Prime Minister Lumumba said of the African Foreign Ministers' Conference, "This conference was a great success. All African countries have expressed their willingness to assist the Congo. African unity is no longer an empty phrase." He said, "We hope to cooperate with all countries. We are prepared to welcome anyone who is willing to assist us."

    维护国家独立和统一　讨伐帝国主义的走狗
    刚果政府军攻下卡隆吉分裂集团巢穴
    卢蒙巴重申刚果要收回对所有机场和港口的控制权
    新华社27日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：刚果政府的三百名军队27日早晨攻下了开赛省卡隆吉分裂集团控制的所谓“开赛矿业国”的“首都”巴克旺加。
    为了讨伐分裂分子，刚果共和国政府已经出动了一千名军队。他们现在除了已经攻克盛产工业用钻石的巴克旺加城之外，还从受到帝国主义支持的卡隆吉分裂集团手中收复了开赛省南部的一些其他地区。目前，卡隆吉仍在加丹加省首府伊利沙伯维尔，同另一名帝国主义走狗冲伯勾结。
    据报道，刚果政府军队已在向冲伯分裂集团控制下的加丹加省挺进。一部分刚果士兵25日已经开到了开赛省和加丹加省的边境，并且同冲伯集团的军队交了锋。
    消息说，冲伯集团正在帝国主义操纵和支持下加紧采取措施，准备顽抗。
    前已报道，冲伯和卡隆吉在帝国主义的嗾使下已经分别在加丹加省和开赛省南部成立了所谓“共和国”，企图分裂刚果，破坏刚果的独立和统一，为美帝国主义和比、英、法帝国主义在这些地区的利益效劳。
    新华社26日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果共和国政府已经调集一千名军队前往开赛省西南部地区，以便向企图分裂刚果的卡隆吉集团发动进攻。
    据伊利沙伯维尔消息：刚果民族运动党（卡隆吉派）主席卡隆吉在帝国主义的嗾使下，最近曾在刚果开赛省的西南部宣布成立“开赛矿业国”，自封为总理，和加丹加省的冲伯相呼应。消息说，卡隆吉25日在加丹加省省会伊利沙伯维尔同加丹加分裂主义者冲伯签订了一项关于在他们所控制的两个地区之间成立所谓“邦联”的“条约”。
    消息说，这项“条约”规定：这两个所谓“共和国”进行共同“防御”，并且成立经济和关税联盟。
    冲伯26日在伊利沙伯维尔向法新社记者说，他已经派遣几个连的加丹加军队到“开赛矿业国”去保护它的“首都”巴克旺加。
    据报道，目前，冲伯集团的军队仍由比利时殖民军官率领。约一百名比利时宪兵在“技术援助”的名义下已经到达伊利沙伯维尔，为冲伯集团训练新兵。
    新华社27日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴26日在一次记者招待会上说，“我们不希望比利时的占领被另一种占领——联合国的占领——所替代。”他说，“一旦比利时军队离开这个共和国的领土，我们将要求联合国逐渐撤退它的军队。”
    卢蒙巴重申，刚果政府打算控制刚果所有的机场和港口。他说，联合国在刚果的主要和唯一的任务是使比利时人撤走，“联合国不是来占领我们的机场的，而是来使比利时人撤退的。”他谴责联合国副秘书长、美国人本奇在给他的一封信中回避这个问题。
    这位刚果总理说，他正在焦急地计算日期看着哈马舍尔德是否会遵守比利时人在八天内撤走的诺言。他说，“我们将以这一行动判断联合国在刚果的行动。”
    卢蒙巴在记者招待会上还指责比利时特务和刚果的其他敌人在
  （前法属）刚果共和国首都布拉柴维尔建立了进行颠覆性活动的总部，策划反对他的政府的巨大阴谋。他揭露，这些阴谋“获得了法国当局的欣然同意”。
    他在谈到25日曾有一些人在非洲国家外长会议的会场外面捣乱的事件时指出，这是“在比利时活动网的唆使下由一些法西斯分子煽动的。”
    卢蒙巴还谴责比利时殖民者盗窃刚果开赛省的金刚钻财富。他说，“在开赛省，有些比利时人同卡隆吉一起正在组织骚乱，因为这个省里有金刚钻。那里有些比利时人利用这一局势盗窃尽可能多的金刚钻。”
    他还指责法国飞机正在从布拉柴维尔飞往路路阿堡，支持卡隆吉在开赛省的阴谋。他说，“我们已经扣留一架飞机和机上的人员。”
    卢蒙巴总理谈到这次非洲国家外长会议时说，“这次会议是一个巨大的成功，所有的非洲国家都表示愿意援助刚果，非洲的团结现在不再是一句空话了。”他说，“我们希望同所有的国家合作，我们准备欢迎愿意援助我们的任何人。”
