Xinhua News Agency, August 24th dispatch from Rome: British Lord Privy Seal Heath conducted a two-day visit in Rome on the 22nd and 23rd, and held talks with Italian Prime Minister Fanfani and Foreign Minister Segni.

This British-Italian meeting is one of a series of talks currently being conducted by Western European countries to contend for leadership in Western Europe and to win each other over.

When Heath arrived in Rome on the 22nd, he courted Italy, saying that Italy will play an important role in the North Atlantic Group, and will play an important role in world affairs through this group.

Western news agency reports say that Italy advocates improving relations between the six "Common Market" countries and Britain. It not only advocates an economic compromise between the six countries and Britain, but also demands closer political collusion to jointly deal with problems arising in the international situation and to coordinate the policies of Western European colonial countries to suppress and obstruct the colonial national independence movement.

The British-Italian meeting communique issued on the 23rd stated that both Britain and Italy "emphasized the importance of seeking to resolve the problems arising from the existence of two groups (the "Common Market" and the "European Free Trade Association")" in the talks, and they "intend to continue to study this issue with their respective partner countries."

The communique announced that British Prime Minister Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Home may visit Rome in November.

On the same day that the British-Italian meeting communique was issued, the French side announced that France had invited Belgian Prime Minister Eyskens and Foreign Minister Wigny, and Dutch Prime Minister de Quay and Foreign Minister Luns to visit Paris.

    法国邀请比荷首相访问巴黎
    据新华社24日讯　罗马消息：英国掌玺大臣希思22和23日在罗马进行两天访问，同意大利总理范范尼和外交部长塞尼举行了会谈。
    这次英、意会谈是西欧国家目前为了争夺西欧领导权和拉拢而进行的一系列会谈之一。
    希思22日到达罗马时拉拢意大利说，意大利将在北大西洋集团中起重要作用，并且将通过这个集团在世界事务中起重要作用。
    西方通讯社消息说，意大利主张改善“共同市场”六国同英国的关系。它不仅主张六国同英国间达成经济上的妥协，并且要求加紧政治上的勾结，以共同对付国际局势中引起的问题和协调西欧殖民国家镇压和阻挠殖民地民族独立运动的政策。
    在23日发表的英意会谈公报说，英意双方在会谈中“强调谋求解决由于存在（“共同市场”和“欧洲自由贸易联盟”）两个集团而产生的问题的重要性”，它们“打算继续同各自的伙伴国一起就这一问题进行研究”。
    公报宣布，英国首相麦克米伦和外交大臣霍姆可能在11月访问罗马。
    在英意会谈公报发表同一天，法国方面宣布，法国已经邀请比利时首相伊斯更斯和外交大臣维尼、荷兰首相德夸伊和外交大臣伦斯访问巴黎。
