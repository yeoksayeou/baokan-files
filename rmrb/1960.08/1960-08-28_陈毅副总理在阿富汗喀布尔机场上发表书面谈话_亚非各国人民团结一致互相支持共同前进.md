Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, August 27th - Vice Premier and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, Marshal Chen Yi, delivered a written farewell statement today at Kabul Airport before departing for home after concluding his visit to Afghanistan. The full text is as follows:

Your Royal Highness Prime Minister Daoud, Your Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Ali Muhammad, Your Royal Highness Deputy Prime Minister Naim, Dear friends:

After spending six unforgettable days in your beautiful country, we now bid you farewell with reluctance. Please allow me to take this opportunity to once again express my heartfelt gratitude to the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan for its warm hospitality.

During this visit, we had the honor of participating in the celebrations of your glorious Independence Day and sharing the joy of the festival with you. The Afghan people waged a long and heroic struggle to resist colonial aggression and safeguard the independence and dignity of their country. Foreign invaders have not only never been able to conquer your country, but have also suffered shameful defeats under the resolute resistance of the heroic Afghan people. The glorious victory won by the Afghan people through their staunch and unyielding struggle has greatly encouraged the Chinese people. As everyone knows, the Chinese people also went through a long period of struggle before achieving their own liberation. Therefore, we can fully understand the joyful mood you displayed when celebrating your own Independence Day. As a marshal of China and a friend of Afghanistan, I watched your solemn and majestic military appearance, sophisticated modern equipment, and full and vigorous fighting spirit with great interest and admiration during the grand military parade of your Independence Day. The establishment of such a strong armed force to defend the motherland and defend peace will make the enemies of peace afraid and your friends rejoice.

Through this visit, we have gained a better understanding of many aspects of your beautiful country. Your magnificent mountains and rivers, fertile land, beautiful ancient culture, and hardworking and brave people have left us with a very deep impression. Your royal government is connected to the people and is striving to make progress; the policy of peace and neutrality you are implementing is wise and correct. Your advocacy of peaceful settlement of all international disputes is in line with the spirit of the Bandung Conference. Your just demands, which conform to the spirit of Bandung, will be sympathized with by the Chinese people and all peace-loving people, and will eventually be victorious.

During this visit, we saw that you have made great achievements in all aspects of economic and cultural construction. Your achievements make the Chinese people feel sincerely happy. The Chinese people have also made some achievements in their own construction undertakings. For example, compared with 1949 and 1959, steel production increased from 158,000 tons to 13.35 million tons, and grain production increased from 108.1 million tons to 270.5 million tons. On the basis of developing production, the material and cultural life of the Chinese people has also improved to a certain extent. However, the Chinese people are not satisfied with the achievements they have made. The Chinese people understand that in order to completely change the "poor and blank" face of our country, we must make long-term and arduous efforts. The Chinese people are not only determined to make their country prosperous and strong, but also sincerely hope that all Asian and African countries can become prosperous and strong. It is undeniable that colonialism has caused many of our Asian and African countries to be poor and backward. The peoples of Asian and African countries who have freed themselves from the shackles of colonialism are all faced with the historical task of building their own countries. The Chinese people are pleased to see that in recent years, the Asian and African countries that have gained independence have made great achievements in their respective construction undertakings. But it is also undeniable that the construction achievements we have already made are still far from enough, and compared to the historical tasks we want to accomplish, it is only a beginning; and it is foreseeable that we will encounter such or such difficulties in our respective construction undertakings. Precisely because of this, we Asian and African peoples should unite, learn from each other, support each other, and move forward together. We should establish such lofty ambitions: we must transform our countries from poor to rich and from backward to advanced. We Asian and African peoples are hardworking and brave people, we all have a long history of culture and rich resources, we must strive to become strong and realize this lofty ambition, and we have all the conditions to realize this lofty ambition.

During this visit, we held friendly and sincere talks with the leaders of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, headed by His Royal Highness Prime Minister Daoud. Our talks have yielded significant results. Our two governments have signed a treaty of friendship and non-aggression. This treaty is the crystallization of the deep friendship between our two countries and an embodiment and development of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit. This treaty will surely further enhance the friendly relations and close co-operation between our two countries, and will also be an important contribution to promoting the friendly unity of Asian and African countries and safeguarding the cause of world peace. I believe that the signing of this treaty will not only be warmly welcomed by the Chinese and Afghan peoples, but will also be universally praised by the peoples of Asian and African countries and all peace-loving people in the world.

During this visit, I was entrusted by Chairman Liu Shaoqi and the Chinese government to invite His Majesty King Mohammed Zahir to visit our country at a time he deems appropriate. We are greatly honored that His Majesty King Mohammed Zahir has accepted this invitation. This is another major event in the friendly relations between our two countries. The Chinese government, the Chinese people, and Chairman Liu Shaoqi himself are all eagerly awaiting the visit of His Majesty King Mohammed Zahir.

Your Royal Highness, dear friends, we are about to leave your beautiful country. Although the time we spent together this time was very short, the beautiful memories will remain in our hearts forever. We will never forget the reception and talks of His Majesty the King of Afghanistan, and we will never forget our friendly meetings with the leaders of the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan and all our friends and their sincere friendship towards us.

Long live the friendship between China and Afghanistan!

    陈毅副总理在阿富汗喀布尔机场上发表书面谈话
    亚非各国人民团结一致互相支持共同前进
    中阿两国政府签订的友好和互不侵犯条约，是中阿两国深厚友谊的结晶，是和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的体现和发展，对促进亚非国家的友好团结和维护世界和平的事业是一个重要贡献。——应刘少奇主席的邀请，穆罕默德·查希尔国王将来中国访问，是中阿两国友好关系的又一件大事。——亚非各国人民要树立雄心大志，变贫穷为富强，变落后为先进。
    新华社喀布尔27日电　中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅今天在结束对阿富汗的访问启程回国前在喀布尔机场发表了书面告别谈话，全文如下：尊敬的达乌德首相亲王殿下，尊敬的阿里·穆罕默德副首相阁下，尊敬的纳伊姆副首相亲王殿下，亲爱的朋友们：
    我们在你们美好的国家度过了难忘的六天之后，现在怀着依依不舍的心情向你们告别。请允许我借这个机会，再一次对阿富汗王国政府的热诚款待表示衷心的感谢。
    在这次访问期间，我们荣幸地参加了你们光荣的独立节的庆典，和你们一起共享了节日的欢乐。阿富汗人民为了反抗殖民主义的侵略，为了维护自己国家的独立和尊严，曾经进行了长期的英勇的斗争。外国侵略者不但从来没有能够征服你们的国家，而且在英雄的阿富汗人民的坚决抗击之下，一再遭到了可耻的失败。阿富汗人民经过坚强不屈的斗争所取得的辉煌胜利，曾经给予中国人民极大的鼓舞。大家知道，中国人民也是经过长期的斗争才获得自己的解放的，因此，我们完全能够理解你们在庆祝自己的独立节日的时候所表现出来的愉快心情。作为中国的元帅和阿富汗的朋友，我在你们独立节的盛大的阅兵典礼中，怀着很大的兴趣和钦佩的心情，看到了你们庄严威武的军容，精良的现代化的装备，和饱满旺盛的战斗精神。你们建立了这样一支坚强的保卫祖国、保卫和平的武装力量，会使和平的敌人望而生畏，却使你们的朋友感到欢欣。
    通过这次访问，我们对你们美丽国家的许多方面有了进一步的了解。你们的壮丽的山河，丰饶的土地，优美古老的文化，勤劳勇敢的人民，给了我们十分深刻的印象。你们的王室政府是联系人民、奋发有为的；你们所实行的和平中立政策是英明正确的。你们主张和平解决一切国际争端，是符合万隆会议的精神的。你们的符合万隆精神的各种正义要求，都会得到中国人民和一切爱好和平人民的同情，并且终将获得胜利。
    在这次访问期间，我们看到你们在经济建设和文化建设各方面，都取得了很大的成就。你们的成就，使中国人民感到由衷的高兴。中国人民在自己的建设事业中，也取得了一些成就。例如，以1949年和1959年相比，钢的产量从十五万八千吨增加到一千三百三十五万吨，粮食产量从一亿零八百一十万吨增加到二亿七千零五万吨。在发展生产的基础上，中国人民的物质生活和文化生活也有了一定的提高。但是，中国人民并不满足于已经取得的成就。中国人民懂得，为了彻底改变我们国家“一穷二白”的面貌，还必须进行长期艰苦的努力。中国人民不仅决心要使自己的国家富强起来，而且真诚地希望所有亚非国家都能富强起来。不容讳言的是，殖民主义造成了我们很多亚非国家贫穷落后的状态。摆脱了殖民主义束缚的亚非各国人民，都面临着建设自己祖国的历史任务。中国人民高兴地看到，这些年来，获得了独立的亚非国家，在各自的建设事业中都取得了很大的成就。但也不容讳言，我们已经取得的建设成就还很不够，比起我们所要完成的历史任务来说，还仅仅是一个开始；而且可以预料，我们在各自的建设事业中还会遇到这样或者那样的困难。正因为如此，我们亚非各国人民应该团结一致，互相学习，互相支援，共同前进。我们应该树立这样的雄心大志：一定要使我们的国家由贫穷变成富强，由落后转为先进。我们亚非各国人民是勤劳勇敢的人民，我们都有悠久的文化和丰富的资源，我们一定要发奋图强，实现这个雄心大志，我们也有一切条件，能够实现这个雄心大志。
    在这次访问期间，我们同以达乌德首相亲王殿下为首的阿富汗王国政府的领导人进行了友好诚挚的会谈。我们的会谈已经取得了重大的成果。我们两国政府已经签订了友好和互不侵犯条约，这个条约是我们两国深厚友谊的结晶，是和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的体现和发展。这个条约必将进一步增进我们两国的友好关系和亲密合作，这对促进亚非国家的友好团结和维护世界和平的事业也将是一个重要的贡献。我相信，这个条约的签订，不但会受到中国人民和阿富汗人民的热烈欢呼，而且会得到亚非各国人民以及世界一切爱好和平人民的普遍赞扬。
    在这次访问期间，我受刘少奇主席和中国政府的委托，邀请穆罕默德·查希尔国王陛下在他认为合适的时候前往我国访问。使我们感到十分荣幸的是，穆罕默德·查希尔国王陛下已经接受了这一邀请。这是我们两国友好关系中的又一件大事。中国政府、中国人民和刘少奇主席本人，都在热烈地期待着穆罕默德·查希尔国王陛下的光临。
    尊敬的亲王殿下，亲爱的朋友们，我们就要离开你们美好的国家了。这次我们相聚的时间虽然很短，但是，美好的记忆将会永远留在我们的心中。我们永远不会忘记阿富汗国王陛下的接见和谈话，不会忘记我们同阿富汗王国政府领导人员和各位朋友们的友好会晤以及他们对我们的诚挚友谊。
    中国和阿富汗友好万岁！
