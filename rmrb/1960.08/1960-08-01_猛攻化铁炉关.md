    Fiercely Attack the Iron Smelting Furnace Bottleneck
    Since early July, the Party Secretary and Factory Director of the Daye Steel Plant have gone deep into the front lines of converter steel production and organized a Great Battle Converter Command. Taking "three-way combination" groups as the core, they mobilized all workers to launch an offensive campaign targeting the two weak links of iron smelting furnace iron adhesion and insufficient supply of furnace lining bricks. After the first campaign from July 9th to 16th, the phenomenon of iron adhesion in the iron smelting furnace has been basically eliminated, and the production and supply of furnace lining bricks have also greatly increased.

    猛攻化铁炉关
    大冶钢厂党委书记和厂长，自7月上旬以来，深入转炉生产第一线，组织了大战转炉指挥部，以“三结合”小组为核心，发动全体职工，针对化铁炉结铁和炉衬砖供应不足两大薄弱环节，开展攻关战役。经过7月9日至16日的第一个战役，化铁炉结铁现象已基本消灭，炉衬砖的生产和供应量也有很大提高。
