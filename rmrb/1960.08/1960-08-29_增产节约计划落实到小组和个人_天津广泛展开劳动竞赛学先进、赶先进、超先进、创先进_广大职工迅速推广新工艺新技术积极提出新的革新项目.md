Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 28th:  The workers on the industrial front in Tianjin have recently pushed the mass movement of learning from, catching up with, surpassing, and creating advanced indicators, and striving for five firsts, to a new high tide. Various forms of production increase and thrift competitions are being widely launched in factories throughout the city.

As the production increase and thrift movement deepens, production in various factories is increasing substantially. In mid-August, the city's steel production increased by 34.65% compared to the first ten days of the month. The output of other major products, such as steel, ferromanganese, electricity generation, refractory bricks, winches, metal cutting machine tools, gas engines, electric motors, transformers, sulfuric acid, caustic soda, soda ash, chemical pesticides, and plastics, totaling seventy-two products, also increased compared to the first ten days of the month, with the largest increase reaching fourteen times.

Since July, the industrial front in Tianjin has launched a mass movement to learn from, catch up with, surpass, and create advanced indicators, and strive for first place in output, quality, variety, raw material consumption, and safe production, promoting a leap forward in production. Recently, under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, factories throughout the city mobilized workers to comprehensively review the completion of the state plan for the first seven months of the year, and to formulate production increase and thrift plans and measures for the last four months of the year, implementing them down to the workshops, groups, and individuals. Many factories have adopted the methods of "explaining," "debating," and "formulating" in this work. Leading cadres of the Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant went deep into the groups, repeatedly explaining to the masses the progress of plan completion in the first seven months, the tasks and preliminary arrangements for the last four months, as well as the current excellent situation, favorable conditions, and existing key problems. They then organized workers to launch a mass movement of investigation of critical points and formulation of measures, centered on the converter and focusing on the pig iron furnace. After repeated discussions, each group clarified its own production key points and proposed seventy-five specific measures. Eighty-one liaison contracts guaranteeing the implementation of these measures were signed between the sixty-eight production groups of the entire plant.

Using technological innovation and technological revolution as weapons to ensure the completion of the plan is a distinctive feature of the production increase and thrift movement in Tianjin's factories. In the first half of this year, Tianjin's factories carried out technological innovation and technological revolution movements centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, achieving great results. Comparing June of this year with the same period last year, in one thousand three hundred and forty-three factories, seven hundred and twenty-one factories respectively achieved the equivalent of one worker doing the work of two, three, or even four workers. With the development of the production increase and thrift movement and the substantial increase in production, new weak links have emerged in production, which in turn have put forward new tasks for the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. Many factories have mobilized the masses to inspect, appraise, popularize, and improve newly emerging innovation projects, and rapidly apply them to production. In promoting the "multi-treasure combination" machine tool (that is, applying a variety of new technologies in a complete set on one machine tool) in the Tianjin Forging Machine Tool Plant, some workers were not proficient in the new techniques and technologies, and their skills were not up to par, so the use was not normal and the promotion was relatively slow. After inspection and appraisal, the factory leading cadres went to the groups to cultivate "experimental fields," practically solving the key problems in the use of innovation projects, prompting all the machine tools in the factory to achieve "three-treasure combination" to "six-treasure combination" respectively, and the production efficiency was generally increased by half to one time. Recently, workers in many factories, in response to newly emerging weak links, have put forward a large number of new innovation projects. Workers at the No. 1 Riveting Plant, who were rushing to produce converter shells for the No. 3 Steel Plant, adopted the method of screw cold rolling instead of hot rolling to reduce the heating time and save a lot of working hours, in response to the key issues of low rolling efficiency and insufficient working hours for the converter body, cap, and bottom. Worker Cao Xishu improved the spot welding method, shortening the time for spot welding the stiffening plate of the furnace body from six people working for five days to four people working for two days. Subsequently, worker Cui Ruifu developed a new heating spot welding method, which increased production efficiency by another three times. In seven days, the entire plant achieved thirty-two new technological innovation projects, solving the key problem of insufficient working hours, enabling the converter shell production task, which originally required three months to complete, to be completed more than two months ahead of schedule on August 25. The workers of the fifth workshop of the Tianjin Drilling and Boring Machine Tool Plant completed fifty-two innovation proposals in two days and one night while rushing to produce ventilation pipe gate valves for the No. 2 Steel Plant, generally increasing efficiency by about three times, completing the task that originally required ten days in three days.

The labor competitions in various factories have recently become more heated. The steel plants signed inter-factory competition contracts in early August and launched various forms of competition activities. There were both counterpart matches and opponent matches between people, groups, and teams, as well as tackling key problem competitions focused on weak links. The pig iron furnace workers of various steel plants signed inter-factory competition contracts to vigorously attack the pig iron furnace bottleneck. The pig iron furnace workers of the No. 4 Steel Plant conscientiously implemented the technical operating principles of high wind, high temperature, and alkalinity, which increased the furnace life from the original seventy or eighty heats, step by step, breaking through two hundred heats, three hundred heats, and reaching a maximum of four hundred and thirty heats. The No. 2 Steel Plant summarized two hundred and sixty advanced experiences and established more than three hundred advanced pacesetters through technical performance competitions in various types of work, which rapidly increased the production level of many processes and groups. The Wang Zhiyong furnace building team of this factory created a new record of building a furnace in four hours in the technical performance competition. After the Zhang Shihe team learned from their experience, they created a new achievement of building a furnace in three hours and twenty minutes. Subsequently, the Wang Shigang team learned from the experience of these two teams and created a new record of building a furnace in three hours.

    增产节约计划落实到小组和个人
    天津广泛展开劳动竞赛学先进、赶先进、超先进、创先进
    广大职工迅速推广新工艺新技术积极提出新的革新项目
    新华社天津28日电　天津市工业战线的职工近来把学赶超创先进指标、力争五个第一的群众运动，推向了新的高潮。各种形式的增产节约竞赛，正在全市各工厂广泛地展开。
    由于增产节约运动的深入开展，各工厂的生产正在大幅度上升。8月中旬，全市钢产量比上旬提高了34.65％；其它主要产品，如钢材、锰铁、发电量、耐火砖、卷扬机、金属切削机床、煤气机、电动机、变压器、硫酸、烧碱、纯碱、化学农药、塑料等七十二种产品的产量，也都比上旬增长，其中增长最多的达到十四倍。
    天津市工业战线从7月份以来，开展了学先进赶先进超先进创先进指标，力争产量、质量、品种、原材料消耗、安全生产五个第一的群众运动，推动了生产跃进。近来，全市各工厂在中共天津市委领导下，发动职工，全面检查了前七个多月完成国家计划的情况，订出今年后四个多月的增产节约计划和措施，落实到车间、小组和个人。许多工厂在这项工作中采取了“交”、“辩”、“订”的办法。天津第三钢厂的领导干部深入各小组，反复向群众交代清楚前七个多月完成计划的情况、后四个多月的任务和初步的安排，以及当前的大好形势、有利条件和存在的关键问题，然后组织职工展开大鸣大放大辩论，掀起了一个以转炉为中心、以化铁炉为重点的查关键、订措施的群众运动。各小组经过反复讨论，都明确了自己的生产关键，提出了七十五项具体措施。全厂六十八个生产小组之间，签订了八十一项互相保证实现这些措施的联系合同。
    用技术革新和技术革命作为保证完成计划的武器，是天津市各工厂增产节约运动的鲜明特点。天津市各工厂今年上半年开展以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，取得了很大成绩。以今年6月份与去年同期比较，在一千三百四十三个工厂中，有七百二十一个工厂分别实现了全厂工人一人顶二人、一人顶三人甚至四人。随着增产节约运动的开展和生产大幅度提高，生产中又出现了新的薄弱环节，这又给技术革新和技术革命运动提出了新的课题。许多工厂发动群众，正在对新出现的革新项目，进行检查、鉴定、推广、提高，迅速用于生产。天津锻压机床厂在推广“多宝合一”机床（即在一部机床上配套运用多种新技术）中，原来由于有些职工对新工艺、新技术掌握不熟练，技术没有过关，在使用时不够正常，推广得比较慢；经过检查鉴定以后，工厂领导干部就到小组种“试验田”，切实地解决革新项目使用中的关键问题，促使全厂所有的机床分别实现了“三宝合一”到“六宝合一”，生产效率普遍提高一半到一倍。最近，许多工厂的职工针对新出现的薄弱环节，又提出了大批新的革新项目。为第三钢厂赶制转炉炉壳的第一铆造厂的工人，针对转炉炉身、炉帽、炉底的轧弯效率低、工时不足的关键，采用丝杠冷轧的办法来代替热轧，减少了加热时间，节省了大量工时。工人曹喜书改进点焊办法，使点焊炉身的加强板，由原来六个人五天焊一个，缩短为四个人两天焊一个。接着，工人崔瑞符又研究出一种新的加热点焊方法，使生产效率又提高三倍。全厂在七天里就实现了三十二项新的技术革新项目，解决了工时不足的关键问题，使原来需要三个月才能完成的转炉炉壳生产任务，在8月25日提前两个多月就完成了。天津市钻镗床厂五车间工人在为第二钢厂赶制通风管闸阀时，两天一夜实现了革新建议五十二件，一般提高效率三倍左右，使原来需要十天完成的任务，在三天内就完成了。
    各厂的劳动竞赛，近来开展的更为热烈。各钢厂在8月初就签订了厂际竞赛合同，开展了各种形式的竞赛活动，既有人与人、组与组、班与班之间的对口赛、对手赛，又有针对薄弱环节开展的攻关赛。各钢厂的化铁炉工人签订了猛攻化铁炉关的厂际竞赛合同。第四钢厂化铁炉工人认真贯彻大风、高温、碱性技术操作方针，使炉龄由原来的七、八十炉步步提高，连破二百炉、三百炉，最高达到四百三十炉。第二钢厂通过各工种大搞技术表演赛，总结出了二百六十项先进经验，树立了三百多名先进标兵，使许多工序、小组的生产水平迅速上升。这个厂的王志永砌炉小组在技术表演赛中，创造了四小时砌一个炉的新纪录；张士和小组学习他们的经验以后，又创造了三小时二十分钟砌一个炉的新成绩；随后王士刚小组又学习了这两个小组的经验，再创三小时砌一个炉的最高纪录。
