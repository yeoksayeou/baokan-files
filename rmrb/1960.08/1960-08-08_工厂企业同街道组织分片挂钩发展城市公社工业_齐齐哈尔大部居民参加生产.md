Factories and Enterprises, Together with Street Organizations, Develop Urban Commune Industry Through Zonal Linkage
Qiqihar: Most Residents Participate in Production

(Reported by this newspaper) In Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province, all ten people's communes, with large factories and enterprises as the backbone and with the development of production as the center, have mobilized all staff and workers' families and street residents. The entire city, from streets and alleys to staff and workers' family dormitories, from residential courtyards to makeshift sheds beside houses, has been dotted with small factories, family workshops, and production teams engaged in various industries. Production streets and production courtyards are constantly emerging.

Currently, the people's communes in Qiqihar City have established more than 2,600 small factories, family workshops, and production teams, resulting in 106 production-oriented streets, residential courtyards, and staff and workers' family dormitories such as "Ceramic Craft Street," "Pig Treasure Courtyard," "Chemical Industry Courtyard," "Ice Skate Street," and "Red Flag Building." This has increased the number of employed laborers in the city from 200,000 before the establishment of the communes to 410,000, accounting for 93.17% of the total male and female labor force in the city. Among them, the number of women participating in social production has increased from 65,000 in the early days of the commune to more than 121,000, accounting for more than 85% of the total female labor force capable of participating in social production in the city.

According to their respective conditions, the broad masses of staff and workers' families and street women in various streets and residents' committees in Qiqihar City have created various methods to link up with nearby factories, enterprises, government agencies, and schools, and have been organized to participate in social production. The most common approach here is to use the medium-sized factories scattered throughout the city as the axis, with the factories delegating some processes and semi-finished product production, or comprehensively utilizing the factories' scrap materials and by-products, to drive the surrounding streets and residents' committees to form production streets and production courtyards. For example, the local state-owned ceramics factory and the residential area around "Three Hundred Rooms" have been linked up. The factory delegates the production of semi-finished products such as blank making and die pressing of daily-use ceramics to the street residents, assisting the street in establishing six small factories such as "Fine Arts Crafts," "Sanitary Ceramics," "Daily-Use Ceramics," and "Electrical Ceramics," organizing all of the more than 60 women with many children and semi-able-bodied laborers living there to participate in production nearby, forming a "Ceramic Craft Street." In addition, there are also cases where factories are the center, driving the concentrated residential areas of the factory's staff and workers' families to organize into production-oriented family dormitory buildings. For example, the state-owned Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Factory organized more than 1,500 staff and workers' families living in two management areas of the Xinhua People's Commune, establishing 27 small factories that serve the factory's production and produce some daily necessities. As for some streets and residents' committees that do not have productive factories and enterprises nearby, they try to link up with larger government agencies, military units, stores, etc., to establish small factories.

The result of factories and enterprises linking up with nearby streets and residents' committees in zones and organizing production is that the relationship between factories and enterprises and the streets has become closer, and factory production is more closely linked to the mass production activities of the whole community. For example, the state-owned Qiqihar Jianhua Machinery Factory has led the nearby streets of the Jianhua People's Commune to establish more than 200 small factories. These small factories, based on the idea of "ensuring key projects and driving overall development," are organized under the leadership of the commune's Party committee into 18 factories specializing in serving the Jianhua Factory, such as chemical, electrical machinery, bearings, machining, and building materials, producing 65 kinds of products needed by the Jianhua Factory. A large part of the more than 80 kinds of products that the Jianhua Factory used to need to process and order from other places are now solved by the small street factories, ensuring timely production needs. When the production tasks of large factories are tight, many small street factories, starting from the idea of "one family," regard ensuring the completion of the large factory's plan as their primary task and try every means to come to support them. Since the establishment of the urban people's communes, especially since the organization of production streets and production courtyards, according to incomplete statistics, the communes in the city have organized the strength of the factories within the commune, processing more than one million various parts, more than 10,000 tons of castings, and producing more than 21,000 tons of various auxiliary materials for the state-owned large factories, thus ensuring the needs of the large-scale and continuous leap forward in the production of state-owned large enterprises in the city. At the same time, it has also promoted the rapid development of small-scale industries, providing the market with various light and chemical industrial products needed for the people's livelihood. Now, Qiqihar City has developed from basically no small-scale industry before 1958 to more than 40 industries and more than 2,200 small factories and family workshops. These factories have both raw material production, processing and manufacturing, and installation and repair; there are more than 1,200 factories serving the people's livelihood, such as shoe and hat factories, knitting factories, wooden furniture factories, weaving factories, printing and dyeing factories, paper mills, and food factories, as well as chemical factories producing plastics, glass fiber, fiberglass, ethyl acetate, etc. Factories and enterprises driving streets and residents' committees to widely organize production have also opened up a broad road for the full utilization of factories' scrap materials, by-products, and social waste materials, and for large-scale comprehensive utilization of "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups." According to incomplete statistics, the street factories in Qiqihar City have produced more than 350 kinds of commodities through comprehensive utilization of various scrap materials.

    工厂企业同街道组织分片挂钩发展城市公社工业
    齐齐哈尔大部居民参加生产
    本报讯　黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市全市十个人民公社以大工厂企业为骨干，以发展生产为中心，带动职工家属、街道居民，全部组织起来，使全市从大街小巷到职工家属宿舍，从居民大院到宅旁板棚小屋，到处星罗棋布地兴办起了各种行业的小型工厂、家庭车间、生产小组；不断地涌现出来一条又一条、一座又一座生产大街、生产大院。
    现在，齐齐哈尔市各人民公社已兴办起了两千六百余个小型工厂、家庭车间和生产小组，出现了“陶瓷工艺大街”、“猪宝大院”、“化工大院”、“冰刀大街”、“红旗楼”等一百零六个生产化的街道，居民大院和职工家属宿舍，使全市劳动就业人数由公社成立前的二十万增加到四十一万，占全市男女劳动力总数的93.17％。其中，妇女参加社会生产人数就由公社成立初期的六万五千人增加到十二万一千多人，占全市能参加社会生产的妇女劳力总数的85％以上。
    齐齐哈尔市各街道、居民委员会的广大职工家属、街道妇女，根据各自不同条件，不同情况，创造了各种不同办法，与附近工厂、企业、机关、学校挂钩，组织起来参加了社会生产。这里最普遍的是以遍布全城的中型工厂为轴，由工厂下放部分工序、半成品生产，或综合利用工厂的边角料和副产品，带动附近街道、居民委员会组成生产大街、生产大院。比如地方国营陶瓷工厂和附近“三百间”一带居民区挂钩，把日用陶瓷中的制坯、压模等半成品生产下放给街道居民，协助街道建立了“美术工艺”、
  “卫生瓷”、“日用瓷”、“电瓷”等六个小工厂，把居住在那里的六十多位多子女妇女、社会半劳动力，全都就近组织起来参加了生产，形成一条“陶瓷工艺大街”。此外，也有以工厂为中心带动周围集中居住的本厂职工家属组织成生产性的家属宿舍大楼，如国营齐齐哈尔第二机床厂把集中居住在新华人民公社两个管理区的一千五百多户的职工家属组织起来，兴办了二十七个为本厂生产服务和部分生产日用品的小工厂。至于一些附近没有生产性工厂、企业的街道、居民委员会，则多设法与较大的机关、部队、商店等挂钩，兴办小工厂。
    工厂、企业与附近街道、居民委员会分片挂钩、组织生产的结果，使工厂、企业与街道的关系更加密切，把工厂生产与全社群众性的生产活动更紧密地联系了起来。像国营齐齐哈尔建华机械厂带动建华人民公社的附近街道建立了两百多个小工厂；这些小工厂又本着“保重点、带全面”的思想，在公社党委领导下，组织成化工、电机、轴承、机械加工、建筑材料等十八个专门为建华厂生产服务的工厂，生产建华厂所需要的六十五种产品，使建华厂过去需要到外地去加工订货的八十几种产品，很大部分由街道小工厂解决，及时保证了生产需要。当大工厂生产任务紧张的时候，很多街道小工厂更从“一家人”思想出发，把保证大厂完成计划，看作自己首要任务，千方百计赶来支援。从城市人民公社成立，特别是组织生产大街、生产大院以来，据不完全统计，全市各公社组织社内各工厂力量，共为国营大厂加工的各种部件共达一百多万件，铸件一万多吨，生产各种辅助材料两万一千多吨，因而保证了全市国营大企业生产大幅度持续跃进的需要。同时，也促进了小型工业的飞跃发展，给市场提供了人民生活需要的各种日用轻化工业产品。现在，齐齐哈尔市已经由1958年前基本没有小型工业发展到四十多个行业，两千二百多个小型工厂和家庭车间。这些工厂既有原料生产，也有加工制造和安装修配；既有鞋帽厂、针织厂、木器家俱厂、编织厂、印染厂、造纸厂、食品厂等一千二百多个为人民生活服务的工厂，也有生产塑料、玻璃丝、玻璃钢、乙酸乙酯等化工工厂。工厂、企业带动街道、居民委员会广泛组织生产，还为充分利用工厂的边角料、副产品、及社会废弃物资，大搞综合利用“小土群”、“小洋群”，开拓了广阔的道路。据不完全统计，齐齐哈尔市各街道工厂，通过综合利用各种边角废料所生产出来的商品品种共达三百五十多种。（附图片）
