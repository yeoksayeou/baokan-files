Promote the "Post-Selection, Graded, Automated Coal Storage Silo"

    The Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine recently expanded its original mechanized coal storage silo into a "post-selection, graded, automated coal storage silo."

    What is a "post-selection, graded, automated coal storage silo?" It is a continuous automated line that uses belt conveyors to input different types of coal, after they have been selected by the coal separator, into different coal silos for storage and loading onto trains. It consists of three parts: the upper part is the belt conveyor, the middle part is the coal storage silo, and the lower part is the loading line. It was created by extending the original coal storage silo outwards. The original silo was 63 meters long, and after the expansion, it is 133 meters long and 19 meters high. The coal storage capacity has increased from the original 2,500 tons to 7,700 tons. The silo is divided into 84 small silos, each with a loading funnel at the bottom, spanning three parallel loading lines, with 28 funnel silos on each loading line. Each small silo has a volume of 133 cubic meters and can store 100 tons of coal. One end of the coal storage silo is connected to the coal preparation plant, and the selected coal is continuously fed into the silo from the belt conveyor.

    Before expanding the coal storage silo, the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine was experiencing an average of two hours of production downtime for the coal separator each day, resulting in a loss of over 1,000 tons of coal, due to the original silo's small storage capacity and insufficient or uneven railway car delivery. At the same time, because one train car could not be filled with a single type of coal, and the coal users, Anshan Iron and Steel and Petroleum Plant No. 6, were not in the same departure direction, it was necessary to wait for the train to be assembled before departure, which prolonged the stay of the freight cars and affected the operation of "one-dragon" trains.

    After the expansion of the coal storage silo, the increased volume and greatly enhanced coal storage capacity have ensured the normal operation of the coal separation equipment. The storage capacity of different types of coal has also increased twofold, enabling the loading of entire trains. This has eliminated the freight car assembly time, ensured the smooth operation of "one-dragon" trains, and reduced the marshalling workload of intermediate stations, better meeting the needs of users and creating favorable conditions for unloading entire trains. For example, the coal sent to Anshan Iron and Steel used to take more than five hours for each operation, loading 15 cars at a time, and had to be transported together with coal sent to Shenyang and other places. Now, empty cars can be driven in rows to the bottom of the coal silo, loaded and inspected at the same time, and driven away as soon as they are full. Each operation time has been reduced to less than three hours, and 50 cars can be loaded at a time. The entire train contains only one type of coal and does not need to be marshalled after passing through Sujiatun. After arriving at Anshan Iron and Steel, it does not need to be disassembled and is directly sent to the central gasification station for unloading. The operation time of this type of train is about half that of ordinary trains.

    The "post-selection, graded, automated coal storage silo" of the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine is a good model that has emerged in the construction of coal storage silos in various regions. This type of coal storage silo is most suitable for the needs of large factories and mines for loading and unloading entire trains, and it is very beneficial to both production and transportation. It is worthy of widespread promotion.

### 推广“选后分级自动化储煤仓”

    推广“选后分级自动化储煤仓”
    阜新海州露天煤矿最近将原有的一座机械化储煤仓扩建成了“选后分级自动化储煤仓”。
    什么叫“选后分级自动化储煤仓”？就是把经过选煤机选后的煤炭，分别不同的品种，用皮带运输机输入不同的煤仓储存和装车，从煤炭输入煤仓到装车，是一条连续作业的自动线。它由三个部分组成：上部是皮带输送机，中间是储煤仓，下部是装车线。它是将原有储煤仓的一端向外延伸扩建成的，旧仓的长度是六十三米，扩建后为一百三十三米，高十九米。储煤能力由原来的二千五百吨增至七千七百吨。储仓内分八十四个小仓，每个小仓下边都有装车漏斗，横跨在并行的三条装车线上，即每条装车线上有二十八个漏斗小仓。每个小仓的容积一百三十三立方米，可储煤一百吨。储煤仓的一端同选煤厂连接，选后的煤炭源源不断地从皮带机输入煤仓。
    海州露天矿在扩建这座煤仓以前，因为原来的煤仓储量较小，每天因铁路送车不足或不均衡，平均要影响选煤机的生产时间二小时，少选煤炭一千多吨。同时，因为一个煤种不能装满一个列车，用煤户鞍钢和石油六厂又不是同一发车方向，要等集结到一个列车后发车，延长了货车的停留时间，影响了“一条龙”列车的开行。
    储煤仓扩建以后，由于容积加大，储煤能力大大增加，就保证了选煤设备能力的正常发挥。煤的分品种储量也增加了两倍，作到了整列装车。这就消灭了货车的集结时间，保证了“一条龙”列车的顺利开行，并且减轻了中间站的编组作业量，更好地满足了用户的需要，并为整列卸车创造了良好的条件。如发往鞍钢的煤炭，过去一次作业时间为五小时多，一次装十五个车，只好和发往沈阳等地的煤炭一起运走。现在空车可以成列开到煤仓底下，边装边检修，装满就开，一次作业时间减少到三小时以下，一次能装五十个车，全列车只是一种煤种，经过苏家屯也不用进行编组作业，到达鞍钢后，也不用解体，直接送到中心煤气发生站，进行卸车。这种列车的一次作业时间，比一般的列车要缩短一半左右。
    阜新海州露天矿的“选后分级自动化储煤仓”，是各地建设储煤仓过程中出现的一种良好形式。这种储煤仓最适合大型厂矿整列装卸车的需要，对生产和运输好处都很大，值得广泛推广。	　经交
