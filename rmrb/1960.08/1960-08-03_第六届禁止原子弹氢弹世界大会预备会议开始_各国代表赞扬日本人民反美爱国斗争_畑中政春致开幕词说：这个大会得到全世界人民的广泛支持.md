Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd. The preparatory meeting of the Sixth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Total Disarmament began in Tokyo this morning.

    Representatives from various countries, speaking at this morning's preparatory meeting, gave high praise to the Japanese people's struggle for justice and patriotic cause, and emphasized the need to strengthen international solidarity to advance the common struggle against U.S. imperialism.

    Attending today's preparatory meeting were 197 representatives from 30 countries, including China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and India, and 10 international organizations, including the World Peace Council.

    The meeting was declared open by Hatanaka Masaharu, permanent director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. On behalf of the organization, Hatanaka expressed gratitude to the foreign representatives from all parties for attending this very important international conference.

    Hatanaka emphasized that the number of foreign representatives attending this conference is unprecedented, which clearly proves that this conference has received broad support from people all over the world.

    Hatanaka condemned the war forces for being single-minded in carrying out evil activities and creating a Cold War.

    He pointed out: "However, their doomsday is imminent, because the forces of the world against imperialism and colonialism and the forces of peace are rapidly growing, forcing those who promote war policies into a desperate situation."

    Speaking of the tasks to be carried out by the Sixth World Conference, Hatanaka said that the conference should expose the evil activities of the war forces and formulate policies for the peace movement that will enable the people of all countries to deal a devastating blow to the warmongering forces.

    Hatanaka concluded: "The people of the world are now wholeheartedly watching us who are gathering in Tokyo to complete this task. Let us carry out our work to the end to satisfy their wishes."

    All the representatives attending the preparatory meeting observed a minute of silence for the victims of the American atomic bomb.

    Next, the meeting elected a presidium of 31 people, including Liu Ningyi and Hirano Yoshitaro.

    Japanese representative Mori Takiichiro addressed the foreign representatives, saying, "Since the first World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was held six years ago, this conference has the largest number of foreign representatives attending. This shows that the world peace forces have been widely united in the struggle against the war forces."

    Mori Takiichiro said: "We believe that you, the foreign representatives, are here to participate in the common struggle of the world against nuclear armament and militarization, and to evaluate the Japanese people's struggle against the new 'Security Treaty'."

    General Heriberto Jara, Chairman of the Mexican National Peace Committee, expressed his heartfelt support for the Japanese people's struggle in his reply. He said: Foreign representatives are able to participate in opposing the greedy groups from using weapons of mass destruction and attempting to launch a third world war and feel unprecedentedly happy.

    Yasui Kaoru, director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, made a general report at the meeting (the report will be issued separately).

    Ceylon representative T. Gunawardena said that the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance has received great respect from peace-loving people all over the world. Gunawardena emphasized, "This is a new impetus in the struggle of the people of the world for peace."

    Gunawardena continued, "The network of military bases that the United States is trying to use to trip up the world is the main source of the danger of nuclear war. The United States is also trampling on the sovereignty of countries where U.S. bases are located."

    Gunawardena said that the death merchants of the United States are trying to dress themselves up as friends of peace. But "the very existence of the victims of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki shatters the myth that the Pentagon is a defender of peace."

    Gunawardena finally called on the participants to conduct a strong struggle against the war forces that pretend to be protectors of peace and freedom.

    Tain Ketley, Assistant Secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, said: "The root cause of international tension should be found in the following facts. Imperialists are sacrificing the national independence of all countries to expand their military groups. Imperialism is the common enemy of the people of all countries. As long as imperialism exists, there is a danger of war. But if the movements of the Asian and African people to fight for national independence unite with the peace forces of the world, and form a broad front against imperialism throughout the world, the warmongers will definitely be defeated."

    Also speaking at the morning meeting were Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation (the full text of the speech will be issued separately), Mrs. Anderson of the Victoria Peace Committee of Australia, Professor Jaroslav Matinicz, member of the Presidium of the Czechoslovak Committee for the Defense of Peace, and Fernando Santi, Secretary General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor.

    The meeting will continue in the afternoon. (Attached picture)

    第六届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会预备会议开始
    各国代表赞扬日本人民反美爱国斗争
    畑中政春致开幕词说：这个大会得到全世界人民的广泛支持
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会预备会议今天上午在东京开始。
    各国代表在今天上午的预备会议上发言时，对日本人民为正义和爱国事业而作的斗争给予很高的评价，并且着重指出加强国际团结以推进反对美帝国主义的共同斗争的必要性。
    出席今天预备会议的有来自中国、苏联、美国、印度等三十个国家和世界和平理事会等十个国际组织的一百九十七位代表。
    会议由日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会常任理事畑中政春宣布开幕。畑中代表对来自各方参加这个非常重要的国际会议的外国代表表示感激。
    畑中着重指出，参加这次会议的外国代表人数是空前的，这清楚证明这个大会得到全世界人民的广泛支持。
    畑中谴责战争势力一心进行罪恶活动，制造冷战。
    他指出：“但是，他们的末日是指日可待的，因为全世界反对帝国主义和殖民主义的力量以及和平力量正在迅速地增长，迫使推行战争政策的人陷入绝境。”
    谈到第六届世界大会要执行的任务，畑中说，大会应当揭露战争势力的罪恶活动，为和平运动制订使世界各国人民能够给好战势力以毁灭性打击的政策。
    畑中最后说：“世界各国人民现在正一心一意地注视着我们这些在东京集会来完成这项任务的人。让我们把我们的工作进行到底来满足他们的愿望。”
    出席预备会议的全体代表静默一分钟为美国原子弹的牺牲者默哀。
    接着，会议选出包括
    刘宁一和平野义太郎在内的三十一人主席团。
    日本代表森泷市郎向外国代表致词说，“自从六年前举行第一届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会以来，这次大会是外国代表参加人数最多的一次。这表明，世界和平力量已经在反对战争势力的斗争中广泛地团结起来了。”
    森泷市郎说：“我们相信，你们这些外国代表是到这里来参加世界反对核武装和军国主义化的共同斗争，来评价日本人民反对新‘安全条约’的斗争的。”
    墨西哥全国和平委员会主席埃里维尔托·哈拉将军在致答词中表示衷心支持日本人民的斗争。他说：外国代表们能够参加反对贪婪集团使用大规模毁灭性武器和试图发动第三次世界大战而感到前所未有的高兴。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁在会议上作了总报告（报告另发）。
    锡兰代表特加·古纳瓦达纳说，日本人民反对日美军事同盟的斗争受到世界爱好和平人民的极大尊敬。古纳瓦达纳强调说，“这是世界人民在争取和平的斗争中的新动力。”
    古纳瓦达纳接着说，“美国企图用来绊住世界的军事基地网是核战争危险的主要根源。美国还蹂躏设有美国基地的国家的主权。”
    古纳瓦达纳说，美国的死亡商人正在力图把自己装扮得像和平的朋友。但是“广岛和长崎原子弹受害者存在的本身，粉碎了所谓五角大楼是和平保卫者的神话。”
    古纳瓦达纳最后呼吁与会者同假装为和平和自由的保护者的战争势力进行强有力的斗争。
    搬运工人和运输工会助理书记塔因·凯特莱说：“国际紧张局势的根源应当从下列事实中去寻找。帝国主义者正在牺牲各国人民的民族独立来扩大他们的军事集团，帝国主义是各国人民的公敌。只要帝国主义存在，就有战争危险。但是如果亚非人民争取民族独立的运动同全世界的和平力量团结一致，并且组成全世界反对帝国主义的广泛阵线，好战分子是一定会被击败的。”
    在上午会议上讲话的还有中国代表团团长刘宁一（讲话全文另发），澳大利亚维多利亚和平委员会的安德逊夫人，捷克斯洛伐克保卫和平委员会主席团委员雅罗斯拉夫·马提尼茨教授和意大利总工会总书记费尔南多·松蒂。
