According to Tianjin Daily News: Team C of the No. 1 Branch of the No. 2 Steel Plant of Tianjin Steel Works is the plant's Red Banner Team. People's evaluation of this team is: "High enthusiasm, good style, united hearts, and high production." Since the beginning of this year, this team has consistently been the highest in output, the best in quality, and the lowest in consumption compared to all other teams in the plant. The main reason for this team's success is that the Party branch has fully exerted its core leading role, carried out thorough and meticulous ideological work, and fully mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses.

    Grasping Production by Starting with Ideology, Grasping Ideology by Starting with Production

This team has a total of two hundred and ninety-one people, divided into fifteen groups, with Party and Youth League members accounting for 26%. 80% of the workers are new workers who entered the factory in the fourth quarter of 1958, including farmers, people who had been doing odd jobs in the city for a long time, and young students. After more than a year of training, most of these people have improved their ideological and technical level, and some have even joined the Party and the Youth League, becoming backbone members in production. However, a small number of people are also influenced by old ideas and have ideological problems to varying degrees. They do not love their work, haggle over personal interests, pick and choose their work, fear hardship, and are undisciplined, etc. In response to this situation, the Party branch especially emphasized grasping ideological work, adopting a combination of general education and individual assistance, and successively held Party and Youth League classes, General Line study sessions, as well as visits and inviting veteran workers to talk about the history of the factory, etc. At the same time, it "prescribed the right medicine" for different ideological situations of different types of people, inserting red flags and establishing pacesetters to promote their transformation. For example, some workers who used to do odd jobs in the city were tainted with the habits of small producers, picking and choosing their work and unwilling to abide by discipline. The Party branch explained to them the production characteristics of large-scale joint enterprises, analyzed the harm of being undisciplined, and established Wang Xuemin, the furnace chief of the pig iron furnace, as a pacesetter. Wang Xuemin was originally a barber who went from street to street. In 1958, he joined the factory as a pig iron furnace worker. Because he realized the importance of steel production, he worked actively and studied technology hard after entering the factory, overcoming the habit of being undisciplined and observing discipline in his work. Last year, he joined the Party and became the pig iron furnace chief. Through the publicity of Wang Xuemin's deeds, many people of the same type as him were educated, and their work attitude greatly improved.

The Party branch committee members and the Party and Youth League cadres in the team also often go to the groups to carry out ideological work around the problems that arise in production. Their slogan is: "Grasping production by starting with ideology, grasping ideology by starting with production." For example, in June, the branch found that the output of the furnace lining Yang Lianhe group decreased every Saturday. After investigation, it turned out that group leader Yang Lianhe rested every Saturday, and some workers had a dependency mentality, and the deputy group leader did not play a leading role. The Party branch educated the workers to further strengthen their sense of responsibility and helped the group leader improve his working methods. As a result, the problem was quickly resolved, and the output no longer decreased when the group leader rested.

    Cadres "Take the Lead" and the Masses Strive for "Five Goods"

This team has eight cadres, including the branch secretary, duty director, and team leader. The cadres usually spend most of their time participating in production in various work sections; the branch secretary and duty director have more things to do, but also spend 50% of their time participating in production. They are all from veteran worker backgrounds, with relatively high ideological awareness and technical level. They go wherever there are difficulties in production, and they stay wherever it is crucial, "taking the lead" and fighting heroically. The masses praised them, saying: "The cadres are our backbone, and when the cadres are present, problems are solved quickly." On August 1st, the front cover of the No. 3 pig iron furnace was burned through, and flames were spewing out. If the blast was stopped for repairs, it would take two hours, affecting steelmaking. Just as the workers were worried, duty director Chen Yunsheng arrived. He immediately studied with the workers and decided to repair without stopping the blast, adding a new cover to the burned-through cover. After the plan was determined, Chen Yunsheng took the lead and jumped to the place closest to the flames to lead the emergency repair. As a result, it was repaired in only twenty minutes, without affecting production.

Because the cadres often participate in production, they can see the key to production clearly, grasp it accurately, put forward practical solutions, and solve problems thoroughly. For example, when the duty director was working in front of the pig iron furnace, he found that workers Wang Enrong and Qi Shuping were plugging the eye steadily, accurately, and ruthlessly, plugging it in one go without splashing and burning. He organized a performance competition to promote the operating experience of these two people, thoroughly solving the problem of molten iron splashing and burning people when plugging the taphole, and greatly improving production efficiency.

The cadres consult with the masses in everything and rely on the masses everywhere, greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses and improving the masses' sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs. At the beginning of each month, the team holds a general meeting of all employees, telling the employees about the situation, handing over tasks, clarifying the key, and mobilizing the workers to discuss the methods for completing the monthly tasks, assigning the tasks to each group, so that the entire team has a unified thought and a clear direction. Then, the masses are mobilized to carry out various competitions to ensure the completion of the tasks. In July, they carried out a collaboration competition centered on steelmaking and a "Five Goods" group competition centered on eliminating third-class groups (the five goods are good ideology, good production, good unity, good compliance with operating procedures and labor discipline, and good safety and hygiene), which all achieved good results. Through the collaboration competition, the communist spirit of collaboration among the groups was greatly enhanced. If there is a difficulty in one place, everyone comes to support it. Through the "Five Goods" group competition, a system of pre-shift deployment, mid-shift inspection, and post-shift evaluation was established, and many advanced figures emerged in the team. In July, one hundred and twenty-five workers were rated as "Five Goods," accounting for 58% of the total number of people in the team; nine of the fifteen groups in the team were rated as upstream, and the third-class groups were eliminated.

    Party Branch Strengthens Unified Leadership and Various Departments Give Play to Their Initiative

This Party branch conscientiously implemented the spirit of collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility, and the work was always orderly, tense, and organized. A branch committee meeting is held once a week, at which the work of the branch is studied in accordance with the instructions of the Party committee. After the branch committee meeting, an expanded branch committee meeting is held, absorbing the duty director, trade union, and Youth League cadres to participate in the discussion and implementation of the branch committee's resolutions. Then, the trade union mobilizes the masses and organizes competitions; the Youth League mobilizes the youth and does ideological work among the youth; and the administrative cadres are responsible for production command, working together around a central point. In the course of the work, the Party branch regularly convenes administrative, trade union, and Youth League cadres to report, and designates special personnel to solve the problems reported. In this way, there is both unified leadership and full play is given to the enthusiasm of various departments. At the same time, the Party branch has both arrangements and inspections for all aspects of the work, and both general calls and specific requirements, ensuring that all the work determined by the branch can be implemented and achieve the expected results.

This branch resolutely implements the instructions of the Party committee. Their slogan is: "The general branch's instructions will not pass the team, and the Party committee's instructions will not pass the day." Whenever the Party committee has any instructions, they immediately hold a meeting to study them, convey them to the workers, and conscientiously implement them. For example, in late July, the Party committee decided to launch a high-yield ten-day competition to strive for higher output in July than in June. They made arrangements at the pre-shift meeting that day, and the administrative, trade union, and Youth League organizations divided their work and launched activities. A climax of competition was set off on the shift, and then production was exceeded for days, realizing the Party committee's call five days ahead of schedule.

    思想工作深入细致　处处事事依靠群众　执行指示坚决踏实
    党支部带领全体工人争上游
    天钢二厂一分厂丙班干劲足，风格好，人心齐，生产高
    据天津日报消息　天津市第二钢厂一分厂丙班是全厂的红旗班，人们对这个班的评价是：“干劲足，风格好，人心齐，生产高。”今年以来，这个班和全厂各班相比一直是产量最高、质量最好、消耗最低。这个班所以取得这样的成绩，主要是由于党支部充分发挥了核心领导作用，思想工作深入细致，充分调动了群众的积极性和创造性。
    抓生产从思想入手抓思想从生产出发
    这个班共有二百九十一人，分成十五个小组，党、团员占26％。工人中有80％是1958年第四季度进厂的新工人，其中有农民、长期在城市里做各种零活的人和青年学生。这些人经过一年多的锻炼，大都提高了思想和技术水平，有的人还入了党、入了团，成为生产中的骨干分子。但是也有一小部分人因为受旧思想的影响，存在着不同程度的思想问题，他们不热爱自己的工作，斤斤计较个人利益，工作挑肥拣瘦，怕艰苦，自由散漫，等等。针对这种情况，党支部特别强调抓思想工作，采取一般教育和个别帮助相结合的办法，先后举办了党课、团课学习，总路线学习，以及参观访问，请老工人讲工厂史等活动，同时针对不同类型人物的不同思想情况，“对症下药”，插红旗，树标兵，促进其转变。例如，一些过去在市内做零活的工人，沾染了一些小生产者的习气，在工作中挑肥拣瘦，不愿意遵守纪律。党支部就对他们讲解大型联合企业的生产特点，分析自由散漫的危害，并且树立化铁炉炉长王学敏为标兵。王学敏原是串街走巷的理发工人，1958年进厂当了化铁炉工人，由于他认识到了钢铁生产的重要意义，进厂后就积极工作，努力学习技术，克服了自由散漫的习惯，工作中守纪律。去年，他入了党，并且当了化铁炉长。通过对王学敏事迹的宣传，许多和他同类型的人受到教育，工作态度大大好转。
    这个班的党支部委员和班里的党员干部还经常到小组里去围绕生产上出现的问题开展思想工作。他们的口号是：“抓生产从思想入手，抓思想从生产出发。”例如，6月间，这个支部发现炉衬杨连和小组，每逢星期六产量就下降。经过了解，原来每逢星期六组长杨连和休息，有的工人有依赖思想，副组长也没有发挥领导作用。党支部就教育工人进一步加强工作责任心，帮助组长改进工作方法，结果问题很快得到解决，组长休息时，产量再也不下降了。
    干部“身先士卒”群众齐争“五好”
    这个班有支部书记，值班主任、班长等干部八人。干部们平时主要的时间都是在各工段参加生产；支部书记、值班主任事情比较多，也有50％的时间参加生产。他们都是老工人出身，思想觉悟和技术水平都比较高，在生产中哪里有困难就到哪里去，哪里是关键就守在哪里，“身先士卒”，英勇奋战。群众称赞他们说：“干部是我们的主心骨，干部在场，问题就解决得快。”8月1日，三号化铁炉的前膛盖被烧穿了，火焰直往外冒，如果停风修理，需要两个小时，影响炼钢。工人们正在着急的时候，值班主任陈云生来了。他立即和工人们一起研究，决定不停风修理，在烧穿了的盖子上再加一个新盖子。方案确定之后，陈云生一马当先跳到离火焰最近的地方，领导抢修。结果只用二十多分钟就修好了，没有影响生产。
    干部们由于经常参加生产，对生产关键看得清，抓得准，提出办法切合实际，解决问题彻底。例如，值班主任在化铁炉前劳动时，发现工人王恩荣、齐树平堵眼又稳、又准、又狠，只一下就能堵上，并且不喷溅，烫不着。就组织表演赛，推广这两个人的操作经验，彻底解决了堵过水道铁水喷溅烫人的问题，并大大提高了生产效率。
    干部们事事和群众商量，处处依靠群众，大大调动了群众的积极性，提高了群众的主人翁责任感。这个班每月月初都召开全体职工大会，向职工讲形势，交任务，明确关键，发动工人讨论完成全月任务的方法，把任务下达到各小组，使全班思想一致，方向鲜明。然后发动群众开展多种多样的竞赛，保证任务的完成。7月份里，他们开展了以炼钢为中心的协作竞赛，以消灭三类小组为中心的“五好”小组竞赛（五好是思想好、生产好、团结好、遵守操作规程和劳动纪律好、安全卫生好），都收到了很好的效果。通过协作竞赛，各小组之间共产主义协作之风大兴，一处有困难，大家来支援。通过“五好”小组竞赛，建立起了班前布置、班中检查、班后评比的制度，全班涌现了许多先进人物。7月份被评为“五好”的工人就有一百二十五人，占全班总人数的58％；全班十五个小组有九个被评为上游，并消灭了三类小组。
    党支部加强统一领导各部门发挥主动精神
    这个党支部认真贯彻了集体领导、分工负责的精神，工作始终有条不紊，紧张而有秩序。每周召开一次支部委员会，会上根据党委的指示研究本班的工作。支部委员会后再召开一次支委扩大会，吸收值班主任、工会和团的干部参加，讨论贯彻支部委员会的决议。然后，工会去发动群众，组织竞赛；团组织发动青年，在青年中做思想工作；行政干部负责生产指挥，共同围绕一个中心，开展工作。在工作进行中，党支部定期召集行政、工会、团组织的干部汇报，针对汇报的问题，指定专人解决。这样既有统一领导，又充分发挥了各部门的积极性。同时，党支部对各方面的工作，既有布置，又有检查，既有一般号召，又有具体要求，保证了支部决定的各项工作都能落实，并达到预期的效果。
    这个支部贯彻党委的指示很坚决。他们的口号是：“总支指示不过班，党委指示不过天。”党委有什么指示，他们都是马上开会研究，并向工人传达，认真贯彻执行。如7月下旬党委决定开展高产旬竞赛，力争7月超6月。他们当天就在班前会上做了布置，行政、工会、团组织分工展开活动，当班就掀起了竞赛高潮，接着连日超产，提前五天实现了党委号召。
