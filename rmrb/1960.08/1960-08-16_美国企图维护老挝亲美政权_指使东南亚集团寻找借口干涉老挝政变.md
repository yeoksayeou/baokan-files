Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: The U.S.'s tool of aggression, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), is eyeing the Laotian situation covetously, preparing to intervene in the Laotian coup.

According to Bangkok reports, SEATO press officer Pasis revealed on August 12th that the SEATO Council of Representatives meeting will convene on August 26th to discuss the Laotian situation. He said, "SEATO is naturally agitated by the developments in Laos, and we are closely monitoring the situation."

SEATO is manufacturing pretexts for its intervention in Laos. Sarasin claimed on August 11th that the changes in the Laotian political situation affect the "security" of the Southeast Asian region. SEATO's "concern" about the Laotian political situation is the same as its concern about events within its scope. Australian Prime Minister Menzies, from across the Pacific Ocean, also used the pretext of so-called "security" to call for SEATO intervention in Laos.

The U.S. is the mastermind behind SEATO's conspiracy to intervene in Laos. The U.S. has been anxious about the Laotian coup from the beginning, plotting to maintain the pro-American regime in Laos. Just as the coup committee condemned the traitorous actions of the Somsanith government and demanded its resignation, U.S. State Department spokesman White announced on August 11th that the U.S. only recognizes the Somsanith government as the "sole legitimate government of Laos." The "New York Herald Tribune" published an article on August 11th titled "Laos Coup Harms Western Strategy, Puts Defense Structure in Danger," stating, "This (Laotian) military coup may seriously damage the entire anti-communist defense system of the West in Southeast Asia." The American newspaper worried that "if Kong Le consolidates his revolution, an unfavorable neutral wedge will be driven into the SEATO region." The newspaper threatened, "Americans so deeply committed to Laos are probably unwilling to allow themselves to be unceremoniously expelled by a new regime."

Thailand is once again playing the role of the active vanguard for U.S. intervention in Laos among the SEATO member states. Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat told reporters on August 11th that the words "neutrality" and "peaceful coexistence" mentioned in the statement issued by the Laotian coup committee made them "feel concerned." He said that the changes in the Laotian government would obviously affect Thailand, subjecting Thailand to a "serious threat." He clamored that if Laos is "controlled by the communists, Thailand cannot ignore it."

The U.S. is the mastermind behind Thailand's clamor for intervention in Laos. On the same day as the coup in Laos (August 9th), the U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, Johnson, held a lengthy meeting with the Thai authorities regarding the Laotian situation. On the same evening, the Thai cabinet held an emergency meeting, which decided to order the Thai army and border police to be in a "combat-ready state," implementing "special alert" in order to take action when necessary. At the same time, there were reports that the Thai police authorities announced a temporary blockade of the Thai-Laotian border.

After the coup, the Laotian extreme pro-American traitorous military clique was forced to agree to negotiate with the coup committee, while at the same time using this as an opportunity to buy time, plotting to mobilize troops and collude with SEATO to stifle the coup. The collusion between the Laotian reactionary warlord clique and SEATO is taking place in Thailand. The Minister of Defense of the Somsanith government, the head of the Laotian reactionary warlord clique, Phoumi Nosavan, flew from Luang Prabang to Bangkok after the coup to hold "emergency consultations" with Thai officials. According to the Bangkok "Free Communications Newspaper," "Luang Prabang is considering requesting SEATO intervention." After Nosavan returned to Laos from Bangkok, according to the Associated Press from Nong Khai in northern Thailand, near Laos, Nosavan had already established a headquarters in Savannakhet in southern Laos. The report said that there was "extensive troop movement" of "government forces" in southern Laos. The "government forces" are moving north to Paksane, a city on the Mekong River, 250 kilometers from Vientiane. In the north, two companies of "government forces" are moving from Xieng Khouang. The Laotian Ambassador to Thailand threatened on August 12th that the "government forces" would soon "restore order" and suppress the troops of the coup committee in Vientiane.

### 美国企图维护老挝亲美政权  指使东南亚集团寻找借口干涉老挝政变

    美国企图维护老挝亲美政权
    指使东南亚集团寻找借口干涉老挝政变
    据新华社15日讯　美国的侵略工具东南亚条约集团正在虎视眈眈地窥伺着老挝局势，准备对老挝政变进行干涉。
    据曼谷消息，东南亚条约组织新闻官帕西斯12日透露，东南亚条约组织理事会代表会议将在8月26日开会讨论老挝局势。他说，“东南亚条约组织自然对老挝的发展感到激动，我们正在密切注意这个局势。”
    东南亚集团正在为它干涉老挝制造借口。沙拉信在11日硬说，老挝政局的变化影响了东南亚地区的“安全”。东南亚条约组织对老挝政局的“关心”同它对它的范围内所发生的事件一样。远隔太平洋的澳大利亚的总理孟席斯也借口所谓“安全”问题要东南亚条约组织干涉老挝。
    美国是东南亚条约组织干涉老挝阴谋的主使者。美国对老挝政变自始就感到焦虑不安，蓄谋维护老挝亲美政权。正当政变委员会谴责松萨尼特政府的卖国行为并要它下台的时候，美国国务院发言人怀特在11日宣布，美国只承认松萨尼特政府为“老挝唯一合法的政府”。“纽约先驱论坛报”11日发表题为“老挝政变有害西方的战略，使防御结构处于危险中”的文章说，“这个（老挝）军事政变可能严重地损害西方在东南亚的整个反共防御体系”。这家美国报纸担心“如果贡勒巩固他的革命，一个不利的中立楔子就要打进东南亚条约组织地区。”这家报纸以威胁的口吻叫嚷，“如此深深地委身于老挝的美国人大概不肯让自己不体面地被一个新政权驱逐出去。”
    泰国这次在东南亚条约集团成员国中又充当了积极出头为美国干涉老挝的马前卒。泰国总理乃沙立11日向记者发表谈话说，在老挝政变委员会发表的声明里，提到“中立”和“和平共处”的字眼，这使我们“感到担心”。他说，老挝政府的变化，显然将影响及泰国，使泰国遭受到“严重的威胁”。他叫嚣说，如果老挝“受到共产党的控制，泰国将不能置之不理”。
    美国是泰国叫嚣干涉老挝的幕后指使者。在老挝发生政变的当天（9日），美国驻泰国大使约翰逊就同泰国当局就老挝局势进行了长时间的会谈。同天晚上，泰国内阁举行了紧急会议，会议决定命令泰国军队和边防警察处于“战斗备战状态”中，实行“特种戒备”，以便必要时采取行动。同时有消息说，泰国警察当局宣布暂时封锁泰国、老挝边境。
    在发生政变之后，老挝极端亲美的卖国军阀集团被迫同意和政变委员会进行谈判，同时，又借此争取时间，阴谋调集兵力和勾结东南亚条约集团扼杀政变。老挝反动军阀集团和东南亚条约的勾结是在泰国进行的。松萨尼特政府的国防大臣、老挝反动军阀集团的头子富米·诺萨万在政变后曾经从琅勃拉邦乘飞机到曼谷同泰国官员举行了“紧急商谈”。据曼谷“自由通讯报”报道，“琅勃拉邦正在考虑要求东南亚条约组织进行干涉”。在诺萨万从曼谷回到老挝以后，据美联社从泰国北部、邻近老挝的廊开报道，诺萨万已经在老挝南部沙湾拿吉建立了总部。消息说，在老挝南部“政府军”有“广泛的部队移动”。“政府军”正在北上到离万象二百五十公里的湄公河岸城市帕迪布。在北部，两连“政府军”正在从川圹移动。老挝驻泰国大使12日扬言，“政府军”不久将“恢复秩序”，并且将镇压万象的政变委员会的部队。
