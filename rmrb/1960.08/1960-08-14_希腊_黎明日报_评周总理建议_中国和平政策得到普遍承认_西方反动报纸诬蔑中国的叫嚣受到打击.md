Xinhua News Agency, August 13th Dispatch from Athens: "Dawn Daily" of Greece, in a commentary on August 7th regarding Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia and the Pacific, stated that the People's China's lofty proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia and the Pacific promptly struck down the slanderous cries of Western reactionary newspapers that accused the Chinese government of adopting policies against peaceful coexistence, international cooperation, and understanding. The newspaper pointed out that this proposal by China "is a further continuation of the peaceful policy pursued by People's China since its founding."

"Dawn Daily" emphasized, "We must not forget that Zhou Enlai was the person who, in 1955, jointly formulated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with the leaders of India and Burma as the basis of China's Asian policy." The newspaper pointed out that the government of the People's Republic of China has restored friendly relations with independent Asian and African countries based on these principles, and at the same time, based on these principles, has resolved and will continue to resolve its border issues with Nepal, Burma, and India. "Despite the reactionary newspapers that hope that the growing prestige of People's China will decline are making a fuss, the Chinese government's peaceful policy has been universally acknowledged."

"Dawn Daily" said that China's proposal "once again proves China's efforts in creating conditions in Asia that guarantee the peaceful coexistence of the people of all Asian countries."

"Freedom Daily" said, "Mr. Zhou Enlai provided concrete evidence proving that China, with a population of 650 million, continues to firmly pursue a policy of peaceful coexistence." "In order to realize this policy, it has taken concrete actions that can improve the international atmosphere, of course, provided that these proposals will be studied in detail in good faith."

This newspaper also said, "What people can now say is that this proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Pacific is receiving increasing response in Asian countries, and there is no doubt that this fact is not without significance."

    新华社13日讯　雅典消息：“黎明日报”7日在评论周恩来总理关于在亚洲和太平洋地区建立一个没有核武器地区的建议时说，人民中国提出在亚洲和太平洋地区建立无核武器地区的崇高建议，及时地打击了西方反动报纸诬蔑中国政府采取反对和平共处、国际合作和谅解的政策的叫嚣。报纸指出，中国提出的这一建议，“是人民中国建国以来所奉行的和平政策的进一步继续”。
    “黎明日报”强调说，“我们不要忘记，在1955年同印度和缅甸领袖们共同制定作为中国对亚洲政策的基础的和平共处五项原则的人就是周恩来。”报纸指出，中华人民共和国政府根据这些原则同亚非独立国家恢复了友好关系，同时根据这些原则解决了而且今后还要解决它同尼泊尔、缅甸和印度的边界问题。“尽管那些指望人民中国愈来愈增长的威望下降的反动报纸在大惊小怪，中国政府的和平政策已经普遍得到承认”。
    “黎明日报”说，中国的建议“再一次证明中国在亚洲创造保证亚洲各国人民和平共处的条件方面所作的努力”。
      “自由报”说，“周恩来先生提供了确实的证据证明，拥有六亿五千万人口的中国继续坚定地奉行和平共处的政策。”“为了实现这一政策，它采取了能够改善国际气氛的具体行动，当然，要以这些建议将得到本着善意进行详细研究为条件。”
    这家报纸还说，“现在人们能够说的是，这项在太平洋建立一个没有核武器地区的建议在亚洲国家得到了越来越多的反应，毫无疑问，这一事实不是没有意义的。”
