Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 20th: The Vietnam Asian-African Solidarity Committee and the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace issued a statement today on the situation in Laos, strongly condemning the US imperialist conspiracy to interfere in Laotian internal affairs, and welcoming the Lao new government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma's announcement to implement a peaceful and neutral foreign policy.

The statement said that US imperialists have long carried out blatant interference in Laos and instigated their lackeys to vigorously undermine the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, creating a civil war in Laos, and intensifying the conspiracy to turn Laos into a US military base and colony. The statement said that the Lao people clearly realize that the only way to maintain independence and freedom is to resolutely rise up against the US interventionists and their lackeys and build Laos into a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous country.

The statement said that the coup d'état launched by Captain Kong Le has received enthusiastic support from people of all strata in Laos. The coup overthrew the pro-American, dictatorial, and corrupt Phoui Sananikone-Phoumi government and established a new government headed by Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister. This government announced that it would pursue a genuine policy of peace and neutrality and national harmony.

The statement emphasized that although US imperialism and its lackeys have suffered a shameful defeat, they are not willing to give up their conspiracy to turn Laos into a US military base. They are doing everything possible to oppose the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Coup Committee, undermine the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and create tension in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The statement said that for the benefit of the two fraternal nations of Vietnam and Laos, and for the peace and security of Indochina and Southeast Asia, the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee and the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace resolutely oppose all US imperialist conspiracies and actions to interfere in Laos.

The statement expressed its firm belief that in the current international situation, the just struggle of the Lao people, with the sympathy and support of the people of Asia and Africa and the people of the world, will ultimately achieve a brilliant victory.

    声明说，美帝国主义者长久以来对老挝进行了明目张胆的干涉，并唆使它的走狗，大力破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议，制造老挝内战，加紧实现把老挝变成美国军事基地和殖民地的阴谋。声明说，老挝人民清楚地认识到，维护独立和自由的唯一道路，是坚决起来反对美国干涉者及其走狗，把老挝建成一个和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的国家。

    声明强调指出，美帝国主义及其走狗虽然遭到可耻的失败，但它们并不肯放弃把老挝变为美国军事基地的阴谋。它们正在千方百计地反对老挝王国政府和老挝政变委员会，破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议，制造印度支那和东南亚的紧张局势。
    声明说，为了越南和老挝两个兄弟民族的利益，为了印度支那和东南亚的和平和安全，越南亚非人民团结委员会和越南保卫世界和平委员会坚决反对美帝国主义干涉老挝的一切阴谋和行动。
