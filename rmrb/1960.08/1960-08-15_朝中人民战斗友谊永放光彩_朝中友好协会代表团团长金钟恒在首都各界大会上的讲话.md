Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: Speech by Kim Jong-heng, Head of the Delegation of the China-Korea Friendship Association, at the rally of people from all walks of life in the capital celebrating the 15th anniversary of the Liberation of Korea. Respected Comrade Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling, Respected Premier Zhou Enlai, Respected Vice-Premier Li Xiannian, Dear citizens of Beijing, Dear comrades and friends:

    Today, the Chinese people are celebrating the national festival of the Korean people - the 15th anniversary of the August 15th Liberation - as if it were their own festival.

    Our delegation from the China-Korea Friendship Association feels extremely honored to be able to participate in this grand celebration held in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, as envoys of friendship.

    I would like to extend the warmest, most cordial, and fraternal greetings from the Korean people to all of you attending the conference, and through you, to the entire Chinese people.

    From the moment our delegation set foot on Chinese soil, we deeply felt how profound the Chinese people's sentiments and love for the Korean people are.

    In Shenyang and Beijing, we visited factories, enterprises, people's communes, educational and cultural institutions, industrial exhibitions, agricultural exhibitions, the city center, and the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Here, we saw the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, and we saw the new life of the Chinese people, full of hope.

    In China, we were warmly welcomed by many cadres and working people everywhere.

    I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to our dear comrades and friends for such a warm welcome.

    The people of Korea and China have established a traditional friendship through a long history.

    In the revolutionary struggle against imperialism, the people of the two countries are old comrades-in-arms who have shared life and death and shared weal and woe.

    The friendship and solidarity between the people of Korea and China has become more clearly demonstrated through the struggle against the common enemy, US imperialism.

    The Chinese people once held high the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, sending their outstanding sons and daughters directly to the Korean front lines.

    The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, bravely struggling against US imperialism.

    The heroic Huang Jiguang of the Chinese People's Volunteers blocked the enemy's gun with his chest, ensuring the victory of the battle; the hero Yang Gensi, for the happiness of the Korean people, spared no effort to dedicate his life; Martyr Luo Shengjiao, saved a Korean child with his own life.

    All the volunteer soldiers, like the heroes Huang Jiguang and Yang Gensi, defended every inch of Korean land with their lives, and like Martyr Luo Shengjiao, they cared for the Korean people, cherishing the mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees of Korea as if they were their own.

    The blood shed by the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the beautiful land of Korea will shine forever along with the beautiful mountains and rivers of Korea; the example of internationalist spirit set by the volunteer soldiers will be forever engraved in the hearts of the Korean people.

    In our difficult post-war period, the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Chinese people, provided material and spiritual assistance to the Korean people.

    The great achievements made by the volunteer soldiers in the socialist construction of Korea, and the beautiful and moving stories left behind, will be passed down from generation to generation like legends.

    Today, in commemoration of the 15th anniversary of the August 15th Liberation of Korea, the mother of the most respected hero Huang Jiguang of the Korean people has come from the distant province of Sichuan to participate in the conference. At the same time, many volunteer soldiers who made immortal contributions in the Korean War are also participating in the conference.

    Here, I would like to once again extend my cordial greetings and high respect to the volunteer soldiers who participated in the Korean War, their relatives, and the Chinese people.

    After the armistice, the Korean people picked up the first shovel for reconstruction on the ruins.

    During this difficult period, the people of the great Soviet Union and China, as well as other fraternal countries, provided tremendous material and spiritual assistance to the Korean people. This greatly encouraged the Korean people who were engaged in post-war reconstruction and socialist construction, and greatly helped to quickly heal the wounds of war and lay the foundation for today's national independent economy.

    With the sincere help of the Chinese people, many factories and enterprises such as the Sinuiju Enamel Factory and the Dingzhou and Gaoyuan locomotive depots have been restored and built.

    The Chinese people have also raised many of our war orphans into excellent workers, and have trained a large number of technicians for us.

    In many factories and enterprises that stand tall like the Korea-China Friendship Memorial Tower, the machines you sent are now spinning rapidly for the prosperity of the Korean people, with deafening sounds; the war orphans and technicians who grew up in the warm embrace of the Chinese people have become Chollima riders, establishing great labor achievements in various sectors of the people's economy.

    In addition, the Chinese people have actively supported the Korean people's sacred struggle to force US imperialism out of South Korea and strive for the peaceful reunification of their country.

    The Government of the People's Republic of China has taken the initiative to withdraw the Volunteers from Korea, thus opening up a new situation for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

    When the people of South Korea first rose up against colonial rule, you issued a powerful call to support the people of South Korea, lodged protests, and denounced US imperialism. Beijing held a mass demonstration of 600,000 people, and the roaring sound of 650 million people heavily struck US imperialism.

    The power of this traditional friendship and solidarity between the people of Korea and China, cemented with blood, is being increasingly consolidated and developed.

    The Korean people feel extremely happy and proud to have the great Chinese people as their comrades-in-arms.

    Dear friends!

    Today, the Chinese people have achieved great success in socialist construction and have become a powerful socialist country.

    The great fraternal Chinese people have completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule; last year's total industrial output value increased by 39.3% compared to the previous year; and agricultural production has also achieved tremendous success.

    Based on these achievements, a great leap forward has also taken place in technological and cultural revolutions.

    Everyone creates, every factory innovates, a new life is thriving on the vast land of China, and the Chinese people are moving towards communism like a whirlwind.

    These brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people are the splendid fruits of the general line of the Chinese Communist Party for building socialism.

    These outstanding achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction in their own country have made a great contribution to further strengthening and developing the invincible power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    The Korean people are as happy as if it were their own victory and achievement with the victories and achievements made by the Chinese people in the socialist Great Leap Forward, and express their warm congratulations.

    Today, the Korean people are grandly celebrating the 15th anniversary of the August 15th Liberation, which was achieved by relying on the great Soviet army.

    The Korean people, as solid as a rock, united around the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, look forward to a brilliant future with confidence and continue to fly forward at the speed of Chollima.

    However, the Korean people's greatest national aspiration—the peaceful reunification of the motherland—has not yet been realized because US imperialism occupies South Korea.

    The Korean people, closely united in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, must force US imperialism out of South Korea, must peacefully reunify their country, and build a socialist paradise on the three thousand li of land.

    Dear friends!

    US imperialism, which regards war as a source of wealth, is frantically intensifying tensions everywhere in the world.

    US imperialism is the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples.

    Exposing the crimes of US imperialism and smashing its every conspiracy is our sacred duty.

    The Korean people have always supported and continue to support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan.

    The Korean people firmly believe that the day is not far off when US imperialism will get out of Taiwan and Taiwan will return to the embrace of 650 million people.

    Today, the political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological power of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and the socialist camp countries are rapidly strengthening and developing, and this is the reliable guarantee to prevent imperialism from launching a new war.

    Holding high the banner of invincible Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, the Korean people will closely unite in the socialist family with the Soviet Union as the core, and will forever advance shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Chinese people for peace, socialism, and communism!

    Finally, I wish the Chinese people even greater achievements in socialist construction.

    Long live the unbreakable friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese peoples, forged with blood!

    Long live the great

    朝中人民战斗友谊永放光彩
    朝中友好协会代表团团长金钟恒在首都各界大会上的讲话
    新华社14日讯　朝中友好协会代表团团长金钟恒在首都各界庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年大会上的讲话。尊敬的宋庆龄副主席同志，尊敬的周恩来总理同志，尊敬的李先念副总理同志，亲爱的各位北京市民，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    今天，中国人民像庆祝自己的节日一样隆重庆祝朝鲜人民的全民节日——八·一五解放十五周年。
    我们朝中友协代表团一行，能够作为友好使节参加在中华人民共和国的首都北京举行的这一盛大的庆祝大会，感到无上光荣。
    我谨向参加大会的各位并且通过各位向全体中国人民转达朝鲜人民最热烈的、亲切的、兄弟般的问候。
    我们代表团一踏上中国土地，就深深感觉到中国人民对朝鲜人民的情谊和友爱是多么深厚。
    我们在沈阳和北京参观了工厂、企业、人民公社、教育文化机关、工业展览馆、农业展览馆、市中心地区和中国人民解放军军事博物馆等。在这里，我们看到了中国人民在以毛泽东主席为首的伟大中国共产党领导下所取得的辉煌成就，看到了中国人民充满希望的新生活。
    在中国，我们到处受到许多干部和劳动人民的热烈欢迎。
    对于如此热烈地欢迎我们，我借这个机会，向亲爱的同志们和朋友们表示衷心的感谢。
    朝中两国人民，通过悠久的历史，建立了传统的友谊。
    在反对帝国主义的革命斗争中，两国人民是同生死共患难的老战友。
    朝中两国人民的友谊和团结威力，通过反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争，更加清楚地显示出来。
    中国人民曾经高举抗美援朝的旗帜，把自己的优秀儿女直接派到朝鲜前线。
    中国人民志愿军官兵，同朝鲜人民军并肩携手，英勇斗争，反对美帝国主义。
    中国人民志愿军英雄黄继光，用自己的胸膛堵住敌人的枪口，保证了战斗的胜利；英雄杨根思，为了朝鲜人民的幸福，毫不吝惜地献出了自己的生命；罗盛教烈士，用自己的生命拯救了朝鲜孩子。
    所有的志愿军勇士，都像英雄黄继光和杨根思一样用自己的生命保卫了朝鲜的每一寸土地，都像罗盛教烈士一样爱护朝鲜人民，像珍惜自己的山水草木一样珍惜朝鲜的一山一水一草一木。
    中国人民志愿军勇士们流在朝鲜锦绣江山的鲜血，将同朝鲜美丽的山河一起，永放光彩；志愿军勇士们树立的国际主义精神的榜样，将永远铭记在朝鲜人民的心坎上。
    在我们战后的艰苦时期，中国人民志愿军勇士们又同中国人民一道，从物质上和精神上援助了朝鲜人民。
    志愿军勇士们在朝鲜的社会主义建设中建立的丰功伟绩，留下的美丽动人的故事，将像传说一样子孙代代流芳万世。
    今天，为了纪念八·一五朝鲜解放十五周年，朝鲜人民最尊敬的黄继光英雄的母亲，从遥远的四川省前来参加大会。同时，在朝鲜战争中建立不朽功绩的许多志愿军勇士，也参加了大会。
    在这里，我向参加过朝鲜战争的志愿军勇士、他们的亲人和中国人民，再一次表示亲切的问候和崇高的敬意。
    停战以后，朝鲜人民在废墟上拿起了第一把恢复建设的铁锹。
    在这一艰苦的时期，伟大的苏联和中国以及其它兄弟国家的人民，从物质方面和精神方面给予了朝鲜人民巨大援助。这大大鼓舞了投入战后恢复建设和社会主义建设的朝鲜人民，大大有助于迅速医治战争创伤和奠定今天这样的民族自主经济基础。
    在中国人民的诚挚帮助下，新义州搪瓷厂和定州、高原机务段等等许多工厂和企业已经恢复、建设起来。
    中国人民还把我们的许多战灾孤儿抚育成为优秀的工作人员，并且为我们培养了大批技术人员。
    在像朝中友谊纪念塔一般巍然屹立的许多工厂和企业里，你们送来的机器，今天正为朝鲜人民的繁荣而飞快旋转，响声震天；在中国人民温暖的怀抱里成长起来的战灾孤儿和技术人员，已经成为千里马骑士，在人民经济各个部门建立着伟大的劳动功绩。
    此外，中国人民还积极支援朝鲜人民迫使美帝国主义滚出南朝鲜、争取祖国和平统一的神圣斗争。
    中华人民共和国政府已经使志愿军主动撤出朝鲜，从而为朝鲜的和平统一打开了新的局面。
    当南朝鲜人民刚一起来反对殖民统治的时候，你们就发出强大的呼声，支援南朝鲜人民，提出抗议，痛斥美帝国主义。北京举行了六十万人的群众大示威，六亿五千万人民怒涛一般的吼声，沉重地打击了美帝国主义。
    朝中两国人民用鲜血凝成的这种传统友谊和团结的威力，正在日益巩固和发展。
    朝鲜人民为有中国人民这样伟大的人民做自己的战友而感到万分幸福和骄傲。
    亲爱的朋友们！
    今天，中国人民在社会主义建设中获得了伟大的成就，已经变成一个威力强大的社会主义强国。
    伟大的兄弟的中国人民已经提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标；去年的工业生产总值，比前年增长了39.3％；农业生产也获得了巨大的成就。
    以这些成就为基础，在技术革命和文化革命方面也产生了大跃进。
    人人创造，厂厂革新，中国辽阔的大地上新的生活欣欣向荣，中国人民势如疾风地奔向共产主义。
    中国人民所取得的这些光辉成就，是中国共产党建设社会主义的总路线的灿烂硕果。
    中国人民在本国的社会主义建设中取得的这些出色成就，对于进一步加强和发展以苏联为首的社会主义阵营不可战胜的威力，作出了巨大的贡献。
    对于中国人民在社会主义大跃进中取得的胜利和成就，朝鲜人民像对待自己的胜利和成就一样感到高兴，并表示热烈的祝贺。
    今天，朝鲜人民正在隆重庆祝八·一五依靠伟大苏联军队获得解放十五周年。
    朝鲜人民坚如磐石地团结在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的周围，满怀信心地展望着辉煌的未来，继续以千里马之势向前飞奔。
    然而，朝鲜人民最大的民族宿愿——祖国的和平统一，由于美帝国主义霸占着南朝鲜，因而还没有实现。
    紧密团结在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的朝鲜人民，一定要迫使美帝国主义滚出南朝鲜，一定要和平统一祖国，在三千里疆土上建立一个社会主义乐园。
    亲爱的朋友们！
    把战争当做财源的美帝国主义，正在全世界到处更加疯狂地加剧紧张局势。
    美帝国主义是朝鲜人民和中国人民的共同敌人。
    揭露美帝国主义的罪恶，粉碎它的每一个阴谋，是我们的神圣义务。
    朝鲜人民一向支援并且继续支援中国人民解放台湾的斗争。
    朝鲜人民坚信：美帝国主义滚出台湾和台湾回到六亿五千万人民怀抱的日子不远了。
    今天，苏联、中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营各国的政治、经济、文化和科学技术的威力正在迅速加强和发展，而这就是制止帝国主义发动新战争的可靠保证。
    朝鲜人民高举战无不胜的马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，为了和平、社会主义和共产主义，将紧密团结在以苏联为核心的社会主义大家庭中，永远同兄弟的中国人民并肩前进！
    最后，祝中国人民在社会主义建设中获得更伟大的成就。
    朝中两国人民用鲜血结成的牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！
    以毛泽东主席为首的伟大的中国共产党和中华人民共和国万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营不可战胜的统一和团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
