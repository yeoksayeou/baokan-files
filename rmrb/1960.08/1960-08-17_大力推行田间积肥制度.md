Vigorously Promote the Field Manure Accumulation System
Wang Caoli, Director of the Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee

(I)
Fertilizer is the “food” of food and a major component of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." From a technical perspective, agricultural production increases have always been closely linked to increased fertilizer application. Since liberation, the rapid growth of agricultural output in our province has been inseparable from the continuous increase in fertilizer application. The role of fertilizer has become even more prominent in the great leap forward and bumper harvest movements since 1958. In the future, applying more and better fertilizer remains a major measure for developing agricultural production at high speed. Therefore, fertilizer must be treated as a long-term basic agricultural construction project.

Before liberation, due to the long-term rule of the puppet regime and the exploiting classes, cultivation in our province was very extensive, with most of the cultivated land not fertilized. Fertilized land accounted for only about 30% of the total cultivated area. Moreover, the amount of fertilizer applied was very small, generally only about 2,000 catties per mu. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, with the victorious progress of the land reform movement and the agricultural cooperativization movement, fertilizer work and other various measures to increase production were listed as important construction projects for agricultural production and were increasingly strengthened. "Five haves and three diligences" manure accumulation campaigns have been carried out continuously over the years, and mass manure accumulation campaigns of thousands of troops and horses have been carried out continuously since the Great Leap Forward, which has continuously improved and developed fertilizer work. In 1958 and 1959, the fertilized area reached more than 80% of the total cultivated area, with an average of about 4,000 catties of fertilizer applied per mu, fundamentally changing the fertilizer situation before liberation, effectively promoting the continuous leap forward in agricultural production, and continuously increasing yields. However, the workload of manure accumulation, fertilizer production, fertilizer transportation, and fertilizer application is very large. The fertilizer labor used in 1958 and 1959 accounted for about 35%-40% of the total field operation labor in those two years. If we want to apply more and better fertilizer than in these two years in the future, we must increase the workload even more than in these two years. Under the conditions of our province's short cultivation season, large land area with a small population, and extremely tight labor and animal power, continuing to expand the workload of fertilizer work will inevitably crowd out other agricultural production increase measures and the development of diversified operations. This is an acute contradiction. It is an important task placed before agricultural workers to effectively solve this contradiction and apply more and better fertilizer with less labor and animal power.

In order to solve this contradiction, our province has made a series of efforts and gained a lot of experience. From the existing experience, there are two ways out: one is to realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of fertilizer work, and the other is to implement the field manure accumulation system. The implementation of the field manure accumulation system can trigger a series of reforms in the entire fertilizer work. It is not only of great significance to the construction of the fertilizer industry under the current manual labor conditions, but also of great significance after the realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization.

(II)
Field manure accumulation is a major reform of the manure accumulation system in our province, which can basically solve several major problems existing in the manure accumulation system in our province.

The main problems existing in the manure accumulation system in our province are: The first is the location of manure accumulation. This is mainly because the implementation of manure accumulation in the village consumes too much labor and animal power. We know that a considerable proportion of soil needs to be mixed into the production of fertilizer. Generally, about 60%-70% of the base fertilizer contains soil. When accumulating fertilizer, so much soil must be transported from the field back to the village, and when applying fertilizer, it must be transported back to the field again. In this process of transporting in and out, a large amount of labor and animal power is consumed. Therefore, without solving this problem, it is difficult to solve the problem of saving labor and animal power. If labor and animal power cannot be saved, the continued increase in fertilizer will encounter great difficulties. The second is the time of manure accumulation. Precisely because manure accumulation requires a large amount of labor and animal power, it is impossible to carry out large-scale operations during the busy farming seasons such as spring plowing, summer hoeing, and autumn harvesting. Only during the slack farming season can campaigns be launched for a concentrated effort. The reason why our province's perennial manure accumulation system has not been well established and has to mainly use the "hanging hoe" period and winter for manure accumulation is determined by this objective situation. Of course, the "hanging hoe" period is a very good season for manure accumulation, but since the launch of the Great Leap Forward movement, the "hanging hoe" period has actually ceased to exist due to the strengthening of late-stage field management and the comprehensive development of diversified operations. Therefore, if manure accumulation work is not quickly studied and arranged, it can only be squeezed into winter for all operations. Manure accumulation in winter has a slower fermentation rate, poorer quality, and fewer sources of fertilizer. If manure accumulation is mainly concentrated in the winter, when conditions are poor, instead of in the spring, summer, and autumn, when conditions are better, then the fertilizer work in our province will be difficult to develop further. The third is the manure accumulation method. Our province generally adopts the method of above-ground manure accumulation, that is, piling it up on the ground and letting it ferment naturally. This method has a slow fermentation rate and is not easy to ferment thoroughly due to the ventilation and low temperature of the manure pile, which affects the speed of manure accumulation and the quality of fertilizer. This problem is more prominent in winter. At the same time, due to wind and rain erosion, a lot of fertilizer is lost, and there is a large amount of unfermented raw manure on the surface of the manure pile, resulting in a greater loss. Therefore, improving manure accumulation methods to make manure accumulation and fertilizer production faster and better without loss is another important problem that our province must solve in fertilizer construction.

Effectively solving these problems is of decisive significance for the further development and improvement of fertilizer construction in our province. The field manure accumulation system has opened up a path for us to solve these problems. The field manure accumulation system is to send pure manure to the field, mix soil on the spot, and ferment on the spot, which can eliminate the work of transporting soil back and forth for manure accumulation in the village and save a lot of labor and animal power. The implementation of field manure accumulation must adopt the method of underground manure accumulation (that is, digging pits for fertilizer fermentation) (when adopting above-ground composting, airtight measures must also be taken). Underground manure accumulation is tightly sealed, ferments quickly and well, and the fertilizer quality is much better than that of above-ground manure accumulation. Moreover, because peat and various plants, weeds, etc. can be fully utilized as fertilizer sources on the spot, and fermentation can be carried out continuously in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the speed and quantity of manure accumulation are much higher than that of manure accumulation in the village. Therefore, field manure accumulation is not just a change in the location of manure accumulation, but also a major reform of manure accumulation methods. These two reforms can enable us to accumulate a large amount of high-quality fertilizer with less labor and animal power and in a shorter period of time. Then we can not only carry out manure accumulation in the slack farming season, but also in the busy farming season. Therefore, we can establish a perennial manure accumulation system.

We emphasize field manure accumulation, underground manure accumulation, and perennial manure accumulation, but we do not mean to completely exclude manure accumulation in the village, above-ground manure accumulation, and seasonal concentrated manure accumulation. The land and garden land near the village and town still need to be solved by manure accumulation in the village. Decentralized, scattered, and temporary manure accumulation should also adopt the method of above-ground composting. It is also entirely necessary and in line with seasonal characteristics and production requirements to mobilize more people with more power to carry out concentrated manure accumulation in the slack farming season.

(III)
Field manure accumulation is also a major measure to promote the reform of the fertilizer application system in our province.

The fertilizer application system must be adapted to the needs of field cultivation. That is to say, fertilizer must be applied according to the time, quantity, and quality required by field cultivation. Whether such a fertilizer application system can be established depends on the manure accumulation system. Only when the manure accumulation system can provide fertilizer on time, with quality, and in quantity, can a sound and reasonable fertilizer application system be established.

Our province mainly applies base fertilizer during spring sowing and top dressing during summer hoeing, which is necessary for spring plowing and summer hoeing. However, fertilizer cannot be applied at any time according to the needs of production in each season. In particular, fertilizer is generally not applied or very little fertilizer is applied during autumn deep plowing. Applying fertilizer during autumn deep plowing is the best time to give full play to the role of fertilizer and improve soil fertility. There are many reasons for the existence of this problem. One of the main reasons is that manure accumulation work cannot provide a reliable guarantee. Due to the lack of manure accumulation in summer, there is a phenomenon of insufficient fertilizer or no fertilizer to apply during autumn plowing, and we have to wait until winter to accumulate enough fertilizer and then concentrate on applying it during spring plowing. This situation proves that the soundness of the fertilizer application system is a reflection of the soundness of the manure accumulation system. The goal of our province in terms of fertilizer application is to establish a perennial fertilizer application system (the so-called perennial fertilizer application is fertilizer application in spring, summer, and autumn). To this end, we must establish a perennial manure accumulation system, so that there is always enough high-quality fertilizer that can be applied at any time. As mentioned above, field manure accumulation is an effective measure to improve the existing manure accumulation system and establish a perennial manure accumulation system. Therefore, it is also an effective measure to improve the existing fertilizer application system and establish a perennial fertilizer application system.

    大力推行田间积肥制度
    中共黑龙江省委农村工作部长　王操犁
    （一）
    肥料是粮食的“粮食”，是农业“八字宪法”中的一个主要内容。从技术方面来看，农业的增产从来就和增施肥料密切联系着。解放以来，我省农业产量的迅速增长和肥料的不断增加是不可分割的，在1958年以来的农业大跃进、大丰收运动中，肥料的作用更加突出。在今后，增施更多更好的肥料，仍是高速度发展农业生产的一项主要措施。因此，必须把肥料作为一项长期的农业基本建设来进行。
    解放以前，由于敌伪和剥削阶级的长期统治，我省耕作十分粗放，大部耕地不施肥，在总耕地面积中施肥的土地只占30％左右。而且施肥量很少，一般每亩地只施二千斤左右。解放以后，在党的领导下，随着土地改革运动、农业合作化运动的胜利进行，肥料工作和其他各种增产措施，一起被列为农业生产的重要建设项目，并日益得到加强。历年来连续开展了“五有三勤”积肥运动，大跃进以来又连续开展了千军万马的全民性的积肥运动，使肥料工作不断的提高和发展。1958、1959两年，施肥面积达到耕地总面积的80％以上，平均每亩施肥四千斤左右，根本改变了解放前的施肥状况，有效地促进了农业生产的连续跃进，产量不断提高。但是积肥、造肥、运肥和施肥的工作量很大，1958、1959两年的肥料用工，约占两年田间作业总用工量的35％—40％。今后如果要比这两年增施更多更好的肥料，也就必须比这两年增加更大的工作量。在我省的耕作季节较短、地多人少、劳力畜力极其紧张的条件下，继续扩大肥料工作的工作量，势必排挤其他各项农业增产措施和多种经营的发展，这是一个尖锐的矛盾。切实解决这个矛盾，以较少的劳力畜力，增施更多更好的肥料，是摆在农业工作者面前的一个重要任务。
    为解决这个矛盾，我省已经进行了一系列的努力，取得了不少经验。从已有经验看来，出路有二：一是实现肥料工作的机械化和半机械化，一是实行田间积肥制度。实行田间积肥制度，可以引起整个肥料工作的一系列改革，不仅在现在的手工劳动的条件下，对肥料事业的建设具有重大意义，在实现机械化、半机械化以后，同样有重大意义。
    （二）
    田间积肥，是我省积肥制度的一个重大改革，可以使我省积肥制度中存在的几个主要问题基本上得到解决。
    我省积肥制度中存在的主要问题：第一是积肥地点问题。主要是由于实行村内积肥，耗费劳力畜力过多。我们知道，积制肥料，都需掺用相当比重的土，一般基肥中约含土60％—70％。积肥时，要把这样多的土从田间运回村里来，施肥时，还要再运到田间去。就在这一运进运出的过程中，消耗了大量的劳力和畜力。因此，不解决这个问题，也就难于解决节约劳力畜力的问题。而不能节约劳力和畜力，肥料的继续增加也就要遇到极大的困难。第二是积肥时间问题。正由于积肥需要占用大量的劳力畜力，在春耕、夏锄、秋收等农忙季节就无法大规模的进行，只有在农闲季节发动运动进行突击；我省常年积肥制度所以未能很好的建立起来，而不得不主要利用“挂锄”期和冬季进行积肥，就是这一客观情况所决定的。当然，“挂锄”期是积肥的一个十分良好的季节，但是大跃进运动开展以来，由于后期田间管理工作的加强和多种经营的全面发展，实际上“挂锄”期已不存在了。因此，积肥工作如不迅速研究安排，就只有全部挤到冬季去进行。而冬季积肥，醱酵较慢，质量较差，肥源也较少。如果一年之中不在条件较好的春、夏、秋各季，而主要集中在条件较差的冬季来积肥，那么我省肥料工作就难于得到进一步的发展。第三是积肥方法问题。我省一般是采取地上积肥的办法，即是在地面上堆集起来，听其自然醱酵。这种办法由于粪堆透风、温度低、醱酵较慢而且不易醱透，影响积肥速度和肥料质量。这个问题在冬季表现得更加突出。同时由于风雨侵蚀，流失很多，粪堆表面又有大量不能醱酵的生粪，损失较大。因此，改进积肥方法，使积肥造肥进行得又快又好，又不受损失，是我省在肥料建设上所必须解决的又一个重要的问题。
    切实解决这些问题，对于我省肥料建设的进一步发展和提高具有决定的意义。对于这些问题的解决，田间积肥制度为我们开辟了一条道路。田间积肥制度，就是把纯粪送到田间，就地掺土，就地沤制，可以免除村内积肥往返运土的工作，节约大量的劳力畜力。实行田间积肥，必须采取地下积肥（即是挖坑沤肥）的办法（采取地上堆肥时，也必须进行密闭措施）。地下积肥由于封闭严密，醱酵又快又好，肥料质量要比地上积肥好得多。并由于可以就地充分利用草炭和各种植物、杂草等为肥源，而且春、夏、秋、冬各季都可以连续进行沤制，积肥的速度、数量也远比村内积肥高得多。所以田间积肥不只是一个积肥地点的改变问题，同时又是一个积肥方法的重大改革。这两个方面的改革，就可以使我们以较少的劳力畜力、较短的时间，积出数量多质量好的肥料来。那么我们就不仅可以在农闲季节进行积肥，也可以在农忙季节进行积肥；从而我们就可以把常年的积肥制度建立起来。
    我们强调田间积肥、地下积肥、常年积肥，决不是说要全部排斥村内积肥、地上积肥、季节突击积肥。村屯附近的土地、园田地依然要靠村内积肥来解决。分散的、零星的、临时性的积肥，也还要采取地上堆肥的办法。而在农闲季节发动更多的群众以更多的力量突击积肥，也是完全必要的，是符合季节特点、符合生产要求的。
    （三）
    田间积肥，又是促进我省施肥制度改革的一项重大措施。
    施肥制度必须和田间耕作的需要相适应。也就是说，必须根据田间耕作所要求的时间、数量、质量进行施肥。能不能建立这样的施肥制度，取决于积肥制度。只有在积肥制度能够按时、按质、按量提供肥料的条件下，完善合理的施肥制度才能建立。
    我省现在主要是春播时施基肥，夏锄时施追肥，这是春耕和夏锄所必需的。但是还不能根据各季生产的需要随时进行施肥。特别是在秋季深翻地时一般不施肥，或施肥很少。而在秋季深翻时施肥，则是充分发挥肥料作用，提高土壤肥力的最好时机。这个问题的存在有很多原因，主要原因之一就是积肥工作还不能提供可靠的保证。由于夏季积肥不足，秋翻地时就出现了肥料不够或无肥可施的现象，而不得不等冬季积足了肥料，到春耕时再集中施肥。这个情况证明，施肥制度健全与否，乃是积肥制度健全与否的反映。我省在施肥问题上的目标是建立常年的施肥制度（所谓常年施肥，也就是春、夏、秋三季施肥）。为此，就必须建立常年的积肥制度，做到常年都有数量足、质量好的肥料，随时可以施用。如上所述，田间积肥正是改进现有积肥制度，建立常年积肥制度的有效措施。因之也是改进现有施肥制度，建立常年施肥制度的有效措施。
