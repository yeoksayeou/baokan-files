Xinhua News Agency, July 31st: Since the People's Liberation Army launched the movement to cultivate the "Three-Eight Style," various services and arms, and troops stationed throughout the country have produced a number of role models who maintain and carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Army. They have been praised and rewarded for their moving deeds of loyalty to their duties, unity, hard work and simplicity, and striving for progress, and have become role models for the broad masses of officers and soldiers to learn from. In addition to advanced individuals, advanced units such as regiments, battalions, companies, and platoons have emerged in many units. The emergence of a large number of role models has set off a wave of "learning from role models and catching up with role models" in the troops, promoting the continuous leap forward in various tasks of the troops.

    With Utmost Loyalty Defend the Motherland

Among the large number of role models, many are soldiers who have been guarding the sea and land borders for many years, taking the position as their home, considering hardship as an honor, and defending the motherland with utmost loyalty. On a deserted island in the southeastern sea of the motherland, several young soldiers monitor the sea day and night. As soon as enemy planes or ships appear on the horizon, they can accurately and quickly report their markings and speed to the command. On another mountain, Communist Party member Li Yani led his soldiers, braving wind and rain, and guarding their posts with a hundredfold vigilance for eight years, and transformed this originally desolate place into a "treasure mountain" with lush trees, rows of fruit trees, fertile vegetables and strong grass, and chickens and sheep all over the mountain.

    Hardworking and Simple Style Remains Undiminished

Among the established role models, the advanced units and individuals who maintain the true color of the People's Army and carry forward the style of hard work and simplicity account for the largest number. Among them are veteran Red Army troops who have been diligent and conscientious for more than 30 years; and companies stationed in areas such as Shanghai, Nanjing, and Dalian that have always maintained a good style of hard work and simplicity. For many years, a certain air force regiment has been practicing diligence and thrift. Any expenditure exceeding 100 yuan must be approved by the regiment's leaders, and the purchase of a typewriter must be discussed by the regiment's party committee. In order to save travel expenses, the regiment's party committee also planted "experimental fields" in a company, summed up experience and promoted it throughout the country. This not only saved the country a lot of expenses, but also cultivated the virtues of honesty, impartiality, diligence and thrift among all officers and soldiers of the regiment. A certain artillery company has been passing on a kind of "family style" for more than ten years. Retired veterans always give new soldiers a sewing kit containing needles, thread, scraps of cloth, etc., teaching them how to mend clothes and repair shoes, maintaining the style of hard work and simplicity. These role models are being widely praised among the broad masses of officers and soldiers.

    Officers and Soldiers Share Joys and Hardships

Among the newly emerged role models, there are also a group of leading cadres who share joys and hardships with soldiers, go deep into companies, and go deep into the grassroots. Soldiers of a certain regiment of the Shenyang area troops recently wrote more than 200 big-character posters to praise the regiment's leading organs, of which more than 160 were to praise Regiment Commander Yu Hairong. Yu Hairong has always been called a "confidant" by the soldiers. Whenever he has time, he rolls and fights with the soldiers and talks heart-to-heart with the soldiers. Not long ago, the troops participated in water conservancy construction, and he worked with the soldiers of a certain company. Because the scheduled working time was one month, the company's cadres did not mobilize the masses to carry out technical innovation. He said: "Technical innovation should be carried out even if the time is short, first to improve labor efficiency, and second to reduce the labor intensity of soldiers. This is a question of caring for soldiers." Under his leadership, the whole company innovated 48 tools in 25 days, increasing work efficiency by more than five times. Not only that, he also often taught new soldiers to mend clothes and helped soldiers bake wet shoes on rainy days while living with the soldiers. Zhao Yigui, deputy commander of a certain unit, has spent more than 70 days in the company out of the 120 days of construction since the unit undertook the construction task in March this year. He learned and practiced each process from the first to the last, and through his own personal experience, discussed and studied with everyone, and summed up a relatively complete set of experience, which effectively guided and promoted the work of the entire regiment.

    Close Ties with the People

Among the role models, there are also some units and individuals who are closely united with the people and with local party and government organs. These troops all go wherever the local party committee points them to in participating in socialist construction. One night, the officers and soldiers of an artillery company of a certain unit on the Fujian front were awakened by thunder and immediately braved the heavy rain to help the people's commune bring back the rice that was drying on the threshing ground. When the mountain torrents broke out, they used their bodies to build a dam to block the gap in the dam. They are as close as flesh and blood with the people where they are stationed. In recent years, the Second Company of a certain unit has supported agricultural production with more than 11,700 workdays. Every time the officers and soldiers of this company go out for training, they do as they did during the war, ensuring that they do not leave until the landlord's water tank is full, the ground is not cleaned, and the publicity work is not done well.

### 忠于职守　团结一致　艰苦朴素　发奋图强  解放军广树标兵争学先进

    忠于职守　团结一致　艰苦朴素　发奋图强
    解放军广树标兵争学先进
    据新华社31日讯　中国人民解放军自开展培养三八作风运动以来，各军种、兵种和驻各地部队都涌现出一批保持和发扬人民军队优良作风的标兵。他们都以忠于职守、团结一致、艰苦朴素、发奋图强的动人事迹，受到了表扬和奖励，并成为广大官兵学习的榜样。许多单位涌现出的标兵除先进人物以外，还有团、营、连、排等先进单位。大批标兵的出现，使部队掀起了一个“学标兵，赶标兵”的热潮，促进部队各项工作持续跃进。
    赤胆忠心保卫祖国
    在大批标兵当中，有许多是长年守卫在海陆边防线上，以阵地为家，以艰苦为荣，赤胆忠心保卫祖国的战士。在祖国东南海面一个荒无人烟的小岛上，有几个年轻战士日夜监视着海面，只要敌机、敌舰一露出地平线，他们能准确迅速地把它们的标记、行速报告指挥机关。在另一座山上，共产党员李亚尼带领他的战士，披风沐雨，百倍警惕地坚守岗位八年，并把这个原来满目荒凉的地方，改变成绿树成荫，果树成行，菜肥草壮，鸡羊满山的“聚宝山”。
    艰苦朴素作风不减当年
    在大立标兵中，保持人民军队本色，发扬艰苦朴素作风的先进单位和先进人物占数目最多。其中有三十多年来勤勤恳恳，兢兢业业的老红军部队；有身居上海、南京、大连等地区，始终保持艰苦朴素作风好的连队。空军某团多年来一直勤俭办事，花百元以上的钱要团的领导干部审批，买一架打字机团党委要进行讨论。为了节省旅差费的开支，团党委还到一个连种“试验田”，总结经验在全国推广。这不仅为国家节约了不少开支，而且使全团官兵都养成了廉洁奉公、克勤克俭的美德。某部炮兵连，十多年来一直相传着一种“家风”，退伍老战士总要给新战士一个里面装有针、线、碎布等的针线包，教他们补衣服、修鞋子，保持艰苦朴素之风。这些标兵正在广大官兵中广泛地传颂着。
    军官和战士同甘共苦
    在新涌现出来的标兵中，还有一批长年与士兵同甘共苦，深入连队，深入基层的领导干部。沈阳地区部队某团的战士，最近写了二百多张大字报表扬团的领导机关，其中有一百六十多张是表扬团长于海荣的。于海荣一直被战士们称为
  “知心人”，他一有空就和战士一起摸爬滚打，和战士促膝谈心。不久前，部队参加水利建设，他和某连战士一起劳动。由于预定劳动时间一个月，连的干部没有发动群众开展技术革新，他说：“时间短也要闹技术革新，一来提高劳动效率，二来减轻战士劳动强度。这是爱护士兵的问题。”在他领导下，二十五天全连革新工具四十八件，提高工效五倍多。不仅如此，他和战士一起生活中，还常常教新战士补衣服，下雨天帮战士烤湿鞋子。某部副团长赵益桂，从今年3月部队担负施工任务以来，一百二十天施工中在连队就有七十多天。他从第一道工序到最后一道工序，一道道地学，一道道地练，通过自己的亲身体会，和同大家讨论研究，总结出了一套较完整的经验，有力地指导和推动了全团的工作。
    与人民群众亲密无间
    在标兵中还有一些是与人民群众、与地方党政机关亲密团结的单位和个人。这些部队在参加了社会主义建设中都是地方党委指到哪里就打到哪里。福建前线某部炮兵连队，官兵们在熟睡的夜晚，被沉雷惊醒，立即冒着暴雨帮助人民公社抱回晒在场上的稻谷。山洪暴发时，他们又以身体筑成堤，堵住堤坝的缺口。他们和驻地人民亲如骨肉。某部队二连最近几年以一万一千七百多个劳动日支援了农业生产。这个连的官兵每次外出训练，都像战争时期那样，做到房东的水缸挑不满不走，地打扫不干净不走，宣传工作做不好不走。
