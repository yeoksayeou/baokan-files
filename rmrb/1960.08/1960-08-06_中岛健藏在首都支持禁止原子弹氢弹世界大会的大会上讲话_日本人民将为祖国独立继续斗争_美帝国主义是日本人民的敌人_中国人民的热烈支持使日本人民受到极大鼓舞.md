Xinhua News Agency, August 5th. Full text of Nakajima Kenzō's speech:

    Chairman, dear friends:
    I am extremely honored to be able to participate in the Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Beijing today. On August 6th, the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Complete Disarmament will be held in Tokyo. The Chinese delegation, led by Mr. Liu Ningyi, will participate in this conference, which will encourage the increasingly militant anti-imperialist forces in Japan and promote close cooperation between the people of China and Japan. As a Japanese, I express my deep gratitude for this.
    US imperialists falsely claim to maintain peace by force, oppress many countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, and establish military bases everywhere, surrounding China and the Soviet Union, which advocate peaceful coexistence. US imperialists are especially intensifying their oppression of Japan, trampling on the hopes of the peace-loving Japanese people, and turning the entire Japanese territory into a fortress serving the interests of US imperialism. Moreover, it is instigating reactionary forces in Japan, attempting to consolidate the extremely dangerous US-Japan military alliance.
    Allowing the existence of foreign military bases in the country and the stationing of foreign troops means losing national independence. How can it be called an independent country when foreign troops are allowed to do whatever they want and run rampant in the country? The reactionary forces in Japan, who are participating in the conspiracy of US imperialism, are becoming more and more openly running dogs of US imperialism, further strengthening the so-called "US-Japan Security Treaty" which was concluded against the will of the Japanese people, and are preparing to conclude a new military alliance that will force Japan to be subordinate to the United States for the next ten years.
    The provisions of this new treaty have not been formally announced for a long time, nor have they been submitted to the Diet. However, after its contents were informally announced, the Japanese people found that the treaty would hinder Japan's independence, promote Japan's rearmament, and that Japan's military forces, as accomplices in imperialist aggression, were in danger of being used. The Japanese people have been voicing their opposition from a very early stage, but in the initial period, they have not yet mobilized the entire people. However, due to the Japanese people's ten years of experience in the anti-military base movement, coupled with the Japanese people's strong opposition to and frustration of the Japanese government's proposed revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," which aimed to suppress the Japanese people, in March 1959, the "National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the US-Japan Security Treaty" was established to prepare for the launch of a broad unified action by the Japanese people. On the other hand, the Kishi Nobusuke group, which had wholeheartedly become a running dog of US imperialism, ignored the opposition both inside and outside the Diet and signed the new military alliance treaty in Washington on January 19, 1960. Students took action to prevent the Kishi Nobusuke group's delegation of plenipotentiaries from taking off from Haneda Airport to the United States for signing preparations. Therefore, the Kishi Nobusuke group had to change its route to Haneda Airport, which is known to everyone.
    After the provisions of the new military alliance treaty were submitted to the Diet, from February to May, members of the Japanese Socialist Party and the Japanese Communist Party in the Diet continued to pursue the Japanese government's responsibility. During this period, the flames of the Japanese people's opposition movement grew more and more intense. The government's answers in the Diet were insincere, and the Japanese people's worries gradually turned into anger.
    Initially, the vast majority of the Japanese people did not quite understand what methods to use to carry out the opposition movement most effectively. Various laws restricted political demonstrations, and the oppression of officials was also very severe, making it impossible to act freely. However, the Japanese Constitution clearly stipulates that the sovereignty of the Japanese state rests with the people, and it also explicitly stipulates that the Japanese people have the right to petition the Diet at any time.
    The leaders of Japan's anti-military alliance forces told the people of the whole country that they enjoyed these rights. From then on, an extremely large number of people participated in the action, holding petitions and personally heading to the Diet building. The content of the petition was: to demand the cessation of "ratifying the revision of the US-Japan Security Treaty," to demand Kishi Nobusuke's resignation, and to demand the dissolution of the Diet. The unified action of the people, which took place twenty-two times, rose through this unprecedented form of "petition demonstration." The number of people who went to the Diet to petition exceeded the expectations of the leaders who guided the movement, and they all expressed their strong will to oppose.
    US President Eisenhower initially planned to visit Japan on June 19th. The superficial reason was to celebrate the centennial of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States. In fact, the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Japan and the United States, which was concluded one hundred years ago, was an unequal treaty that was unfavorable to Japan. The Japanese people remembered this unpleasant event and realized that Eisenhower's visit to Japan under this pretext was aimed at supporting and encouraging Kishi Nobusuke. The Kishi Nobusuke group attempted to forcibly approve the new military alliance treaty before Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and on May 19th, mobilized the police to suppress Socialist Party members and unilaterally announced the suspension of deliberations, intending to pass the treaty in the House of Representatives.
    The members of the opposition parties, of course, could not tolerate such rude actions, and the flames of the people's anger burned even more fiercely, sparking an unprecedented protest movement. Marches surrounding the Diet, Kishi Nobusuke's prime minister's residence, and the US embassy continued day and night, expressing their firm will to oppose. The general strike on June 4th, centered on the National Railway Workers' Union, was orderly and highly successful with the support of the people of the whole country. The Kishi Nobusuke group originally intended to make the new military alliance treaty naturally established on the day before Eisenhower's scheduled visit to Japan, that is, at zero o'clock on June 18th, even though it had not been legally approved by the Senate. However, the new military alliance treaty, under such intense opposition from the people, had already lost any practical effect and was completely crushed.
    Workers, farmers, scholars, artists, students, and even business owners, clerks, and housewives fought side by side for the same goal. Under the slogans of "Stop the ratification of the Security Treaty," "Kishi Nobusuke step down," "Dissolve the Diet," and "Oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan," more and more people stood up and continued the struggle. On June 10th, Hagerty, the press secretary for arranging Eisenhower's visit to Japan, had to abandon his car and escape on a US military helicopter as soon as he arrived at Haneda Airport. By June 15th, the police, who had previously taken a relatively spectator attitude towards mass actions, not only did not stop the violence of violent gangs, but suddenly turned to attack, resulting in the death of a female student and injuries to many people. After the most honest citizens learned about this tragedy, they were also angered, and everyone saw clearly that the Kishi Nobusuke group was a vicious running dog of US imperialism. On June 16th, Kishi Nobusuke finally had to ask Eisenhower to cancel his visit to Japan.
    Due to the anger of the Japanese people and the power of unprecedented unity, Eisenhower's visit to Japan was cancelled. Although the new military alliance treaty has been formally approved, the majority of the Japanese people have never recognized it. Late on the night of June 18th, the Japanese people surrounding the Diet did not recognize it.
    Late on the night of June 18th, the scene of people from all walks of life in Japan surrounding the Diet with angry eyes is something I will never forget in my life. Workers and artists encouraged each other, professors and students joined hands, and they all swore to continue the struggle to the end. The Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, which had long been hostile to China, participated in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and hindered the friendship between China and Japan, finally succumbed to the people's anger and fell. The Japanese people who participated in this struggle will never forget this valuable experience. We believe that our actions are just. And we firmly believe that justice will win the final victory. It is with this belief that we have continued our battle. Those Japanese middle-class people who did not care about politics have finally awakened. What the Japanese people unanimously demand is first of all complete independence; refusing to suffer the fate of being sacrificed as a running dog of imperialism; and striving for the prosperity of the people brought about by peaceful coexistence. The Japanese people have finally begun to realize that their enemy is US imperialism and its accomplices. What kind of independence is it to allow the existence of foreign military bases and the stationing of foreign troops under the pretext of defense? This awakening of the Japanese people is just beginning, but once they wake up, they will never fall asleep again, and they will continue to fight for the independence of their country.
    In the struggle against the military alliance, the Japanese people have received strong support from the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries. They realize that their struggle is not isolated, but is a link in the anti-imperialist struggle that has swept across the world. In particular, the warm support of the Chinese people has given us great encouragement, making us feel that we are facing a vast world and broadening our horizons.
    The Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Complete Disarmament will be held in such a fighting situation. Since nuclear weapons were used at the end of World War II, a large number of people have become victims. Advocating the prohibition of nuclear weapons is the right and obligation of the Japanese people, who have suffered the most. Opposition to the use of nuclear weapons is directly related to the struggle against foreign military bases for Japan, and opposition to foreign military bases is directly related to the struggle against imperialist aggression. I fully support and respect the proposal made by Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China to the Sixth World Conference that all countries in Asia and the Pacific region conclude a treaty of mutual non-aggression and peace and make this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
    US imperialism has invaded Taiwan and is invading Japan by turning Japan into its military base. The struggle for autonomy and independence and the movement against US military bases in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe are surging, opening a new page in world history. The final victory will surely belong to the righteous people. I sincerely hope that you will support the struggle of the broad masses of the Japanese people who have awakened in the future, and express my congratulations to the friends attending the conference on the success of the Sixth World Conference.
    Long live the struggle and unity of the people of China and Japan and the people of the world to ensure world peace!

    中岛健藏在首都支持禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的大会上讲话
    日本人民将为祖国独立继续斗争
    美帝国主义是日本人民的敌人　中国人民的热烈支持使日本人民受到极大鼓舞
    新华社5日讯　日本中岛健藏讲话全文：主席、亲爱的朋友们：
    我今天能够在北京参加禁止原子弹氢弹大会，感到无上光荣。8月6日，在东京将举行第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会。以刘宁一先生为首的中国代表团将参加这次大会，这将鼓舞愈来愈富有战斗性的日本的反帝力量，并促进中日两国人民的密切合作。我作为一个日本人，对此表示深切的谢意。
    美帝国主义者强辩要凭借武力来维持和平，压迫亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和欧洲的许多国家，到处建立军事基地，包围着主张和平共处的中国和苏联。美帝国主义者特别加紧对日本实行压迫，践踏爱好和平的日本人民的希望，把整个日本国土变成了为美帝国主义的利益服务的要塞。而且它还唆使日本的反动势力，妄图巩固极端危险的日美军事同盟。
    在国内允许外国军事基地的存在，允许驻扎外国军队，这意味着丧失国家的独立。让外国军队在国内为所欲为，横行霸道，这怎能称得上独立国呢？参与美帝国主义的阴谋的日本反动势力愈来愈露骨地成为美帝国主义的走狗，进一步加强在违背日本人民意志的情况下缔结的所谓“日美安全保障条约”，并着手准备缔结一个今后十年内使日本不得不附庸于美国的新的军事同盟。
    这项新条约的条文，长期以来没有正式公布，也没有提交给国会。但是，等到它的内容非正式地被公布后，日本人民发现，这项条约将妨害日本的独立，它将促进日本重新武装，而且作为帝国主义侵略的帮凶日本的军事力量有被利用的危险。日本人民，从很早以前就提出反对的意见，但是最初一个时期，还没有使全体人民都动起来。但是由于日本人民已经有反对军事基地运动的十年历史的经验，再加上日本人民有强烈地反对以至挫败日本政府向国会提出的，旨在镇压日本人民的“警职法”修正案的经验，1959年3月，成立了“阻止修改日美安全条约国民会议”，为开展广泛的日本人民的统一行动作好准备。另一方面，死心蹋地地成为美帝国主义走狗的岸信介集团，却不顾国会内外的反对，竟然于1960年1月19日在华盛顿签订了新的军事同盟条约。青年学生们采取行动，阻止岸信介集团的全权代表团为签字准备从羽田机场起飞到美国去，因此，岸信介一行不得不改变前往羽田机场的路线，这是大家都知道的。
    新军事同盟条约的条文在国会被提出后，从2月到5月，日本社会党和日本共产党的国会议员一直追究日本政府的责任，在这个期间，日本人民的反对运动的火焰日益激烈。在国会内进行的政府答辩是毫无诚意的，日本人民的忧虑逐渐地变为愤怒。
    最初，日本的广大人民还不大了解用什么方法来展开反对运动才是最有效的。有各种法律限制着政治性的示威运动，而且官宪的压迫也很厉害，不能够自由行动。但是，日本宪法却明确地规定日本国的主权在于人民，而且还明文规定日本人民有权随时到国会请愿。
    日本的反军事同盟力量的领导者们，告诉全国人民享有上述这些权利。从此以后，极其广大的人民群众参加了行动，他们手持请愿书亲自走向国会大厦。请愿书的内容是：要求停止“批准修改日美安全条约”，要求岸信介辞职，要求解散国会。前后共达二十二次的人民的统一行动，就是通过这种没有前例的“请愿示威”的形式，高涨了起来。走向国会请愿的人数超过了指导运动的领导者们的预想，而且他们都表明了强烈的反对的意志。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔最初预定在6月19日访问日本。表面上的理由是为了庆祝日美建交一百周年。其实，一百年前缔结的日美修好条约是不利于日本的不平等条约。日本人民想起了这个令人不愉快的事，而且认识到以此为借口的艾森豪威尔来访日本，其目的在于给岸信介撑腰和打气。岸信介集团企图在艾森豪威尔访日之前强行批准新军事同盟条约，竟在5月19日，动员警察，压迫社会党议员，片面宣布停止审议，要在众议院通过这项条约。
    反对党的议员当然不能容忍这种粗暴的举动，人民的愤怒火焰燃烧得也更加炽烈，掀起了空前的抗议运动，包围国会、岸信介的首相官邸和美国大使馆的游行队伍日夜不断，表明了他们坚决反对的意志。6月4日以国营铁路工会为中心的总罢工，在全国人民的支持下，秩序井然，获得了很大的成功。岸信介集团本来打算，新军事同盟条约尽管在法律上未经参议院的批准，但在既定的艾森豪威尔访日的前一天，也就是在6月18日的零点，使其自然成立。然而，新的军事同盟条约在人民如此剧烈的反对下，早已丧失了任何实际效力，遭到彻底粉碎。
    工人、农民、学者、艺术家、学生以至于企业主、店员、家庭主妇等，都在为着同一个目的并肩战斗。他们在要求“阻止批准安全条约”“岸信介下台”“解散国会”“反对艾森豪威尔访日”的口号下，越来越多的人站立起来，继续斗争，6月10日，为安排艾森豪威尔访日的新闻秘书哈格蒂，一到羽田机场就不得不抛下汽车乘上美军的直升飞机逃脱。到6月15日过去一直对群众行动采取比较旁观态度的警察，这时对暴力团的暴行不但不加阻止，而且还突然转为进攻，以至于发生了一个女学生死亡，多人受伤的事件。最老诚的市民知道了这个惨案后，他们也愤怒了，对岸信介集团是美帝国主义的凶恶走狗这一点，大家都看得很清楚了。6月16日，岸信介终于不得不要求艾森豪威尔取消访日。
    由于日本人民的愤怒和史无前例的大团结的力量，取消了艾森豪威尔的访日计划。新军事同盟条约尽管形式上是已获批准，但是大多数的日本人民决没有承认它。6月18日深夜，包围国会的日本人民决没有承认它。
    6月18日深夜，包围国会的日本各行各业的人们怒目注视着国会的情景，那是我毕生难以忘却的。工人与艺术家们相互勉励，教授与学生携起手来，他们都宣誓要再接再厉继续斗争到底。长期敌视中国，参与制造“两个中国”的阴谋，妨碍中国与日本友好的岸信介内阁，就这样终于在人民的愤怒面前屈服，而倒下去了。参加了这一斗争的日本人民，决不会忘掉这个宝贵的体验。我们相信我们的行动是正义的。并深信正义必将获得最后的胜利。我们就是在这样的信念下继续了我们的战斗。那些不关心政治的日本中间阶层人士也终于觉醒起来。日本人民一致要求的首先就是完全的独立；拒绝遭受成为帝国主义走狗而牺牲的命运；以及争取由和平共处带来的人民的繁荣。日本人民终于开始认识到他们的敌人是美帝国主义及其帮凶。以防卫为借口，允许外国军事基地的存在，允许驻扎外国军队，这是什么独立呢？日本人民的这种觉醒是刚刚开始的，但是一旦觉醒就再也不会沉睡，他们必将为自己国家的独立继续斗争。
    日本人民在反对军事同盟的斗争中，得到了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的有力支持，他们认识到他们的斗争不是孤立的，而是世界各地掀起的反帝斗争中的一环。特别是中国人民的热烈支持给了我们极大的鼓舞，使我们感到自己面对着广阔的世界，眼界开阔了。
    第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会即将在这样的斗争形势中举行。核武器在第二次世界大战的末期被使用以来，有大批的人成为牺牲者。主张禁止核武器，是受害最大的日本人民的权利和义务。反对使用核武器，对日本来说直接关系到反对外国军事基地的斗争，而反对外国军事基地，又直接关系到反对帝国主义侵略的斗争。我完全支持中华人民共和国周恩来总理向第六届世界大会提出的在亚洲和太平洋地区的一切国家缔结互不侵犯的和平公约并使这个地区成为无核子武器区的建议，并对此表示敬意。
    美帝国主义侵略了台湾，并且通过变日本为其军事基地来侵略日本。整个亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、欧洲的争取自主与独立的斗争和反对美国军事基地的运动风起云涌，揭开世界历史的新的一页。最后的胜利一定属于正义的人民。我诚恳地希望你们今后支持已经觉醒了的日本广大人民群众的斗争，并且表示同到会的朋友们共同庆贺第六届世界大会的成功。
    日中两国人民和全世界人民为确保世界和平而进行的斗争和团结万岁！
