　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 23rd: The Pathet Lao Radio broadcast today that, according to news from Luang Prabang, as of August 21st, more than 9,000 people in various parts of Luang Prabang Province held meetings and passed resolutions supporting the Souvanna Phouma government and the coup committee, and responding to the call of the Lao Patriotic Front.

　　Participants in these meetings included monks, district chiefs, township chiefs, village chiefs, military and police personnel, intellectuals controlled and squeezed out by the Phoumi Nosavan group, and staff in the royal court.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 22nd: According to a broadcast today by the Pathet Lao Radio, monks in Chanhkho District, Xam Neua Province, Muang Khoua District, Phongsaly Province, and Muang Ngan District, Xieng Khouang Province, recently participated in local people's rallies, expressing support for the policies of the coup committee and the new government.

　　Recently, monks participating in a people's rally in Muang Ngan County passed a letter to Prince Souvanna Phouma and the coup committee, stating, "The dictatorial policies of the US imperialist lackey Phoumi Nosavan group are a disaster not only for the people, but also for religion."

　　The letter said, "We are very pleased to see the people and army of Vientiane, under the leadership of Captain Kong Le, launch a coup to overthrow the reactionary, traitorous, and religion-damaging Phoumi Nosavan- Chao Somsanith group. We are pleased with the establishment of Prince Phouma's new government."

　　The monks expressed in the letter their hope that the government headed by Prince Phouma would seriously and quickly implement the policies he has proposed, and restore the freedom of monks who have been illegally arrested and imprisoned.

　　They also expressed their hope that the new Lao government and the coup committee would stop the conspiracy of the US imperialist lackeys to regain control of the National Assembly and the government.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 23rd: Vientiane Radio condemned the Thai authorities' support for the reactionary "Counter-Coup Committee" in its broadcast tonight. The broadcast said that reportedly, two battalions of (Phoumi Nosavan's) troops traveled from Savannakhet through Thailand to North Sane District. This army was in civilian clothes while in Thailand, and put on military uniforms near North Sane District, before entering Laos.

　　The aforementioned army received assistance from the Thai authorities while marching in Thailand, such as helping to solve transportation problems. All of this shows that the Thai authorities deliberately support the so-called "Counter-Coup Committee" in Savannakhet, which is now regarded as a reactionary faction. The broadcast said that the Lao government regrets the aforementioned actions of the Thai government very much.

    老挝人民支持新政府的政策
    要求制止美帝国主义走狗重新当政的阴谋
    万象电台谴责泰国当局支持“反政变委员会”
    新华社河内23日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，来自琅勃拉邦的消息说，截至8月21日为止，琅勃拉邦省各地有九千多人分别举行集会并通过决议支持梭发那·富马政府和政变委员会，并响应老挝爱国战线党的呼吁。
    参加这些集会的有僧侣、县长、乡长、村长、军队和警察人员，被富米·诺萨万集团管制和排挤的知识分子和宫庭中的工作人员等。
    新华社河内22日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，老挝桑怒省川库县、丰沙里省芒科县、川圹省芒银县等地僧侣最近纷纷参加当地人民举行的集会，表示支持政变委员会和新政府的政策。
    最近，参加芒银县人民集会的僧侣通过了致富马亲王和政变委员会的信，信中写道，“美帝国主义的走狗富米·诺萨万集团的独裁政策不但是对人民，而且还是对宗教的灾祸。”
    信中说，“我们十分高兴地看到万象人民和军队在贡勒大尉的领导下发动政变，推翻反动、卖国殃民的和破坏宗教的富米·诺萨万—昭·松萨尼特集团。我们为富马亲王的新政府的成立感到高兴。”
    这些僧侣在信中表示希望以富马亲王为首的政府将严正地、迅速地实行他所提出的政策，并恢复被非法逮捕和监禁的僧侣的自由。
    他们还希望老挝新政府和政变委员会制止美帝国主义的走狗重新控制国会和政府的阴谋。
    新华社河内23日电　万象电台在今晚的广播中谴责泰国当局支持反动的“反政变委员会”。广播说，据说，有两营（富米·诺萨万的）军队从沙湾拿吉取道泰国来到北汕县。这支军队在泰国境内时穿便衣，到达北汕县附近，即进入老挝之前便换上军装。
    上述军队在泰国行军时，得到泰国当局提供的便利，如帮助解决运输问题等。这一切说明，泰国当局蓄意支持在沙湾拿吉的已被看作是反动派的所谓“反政变委员会”。广播说，老挝政府对泰国政府的上述行为感到非常遗憾。
