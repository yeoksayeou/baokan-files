The U.S. Government in the Dock
By People's Daily Commentator

The Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union has concluded its trial of American spy pilot Francis Gary Powers, sentencing him to ten years' deprivation of freedom. This is a just trial of aggressive U.S. imperialism, exposing the gangster face of U.S. imperialism, which disguises peace, pursues a policy of war and a policy of aggression.

During the trial, the American spy criminal Powers confessed to his crimes of engaging in espionage activities and infringing on Soviet sovereignty. The judgment of the Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union pointed out that, according to the materials of the case and the defendant Powers' confession, Powers' criminal flight into Soviet airspace on May 1 this year was prepared long in advance, with the aim of sabotaging the summit meeting and hindering the relaxation of international tensions. The judgment also pointed out that "the aggressive act of the United States carried out by the defendant Powers poses a threat to universal peace." The bellicose nature and aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism, which is hostile to the socialist camp and hostile to world peace, have once again been exposed in this trial.

In the face of this trial, the U.S. government is in a very awkward position. In the dock, in fact, is the U.S. government. After the U-2 spy plane was shot down, the U.S. government denied it in vain, and even announced that the black deeds committed by Powers were the national policy of the United States. The trial of Powers is also a trial of the U.S. government. The "New York Post" said, "What is placed in the dock by the Russians is, of course, the United States itself. Our (American) government has actually admitted its guilt in conducting espionage activities and in the clumsy handling of this incident, and we have been punished with loss of prestige and confidence."

Eisenhower felt extremely uneasy about the criminal status of himself and the government he led. His press secretary, Hagerty, issued a statement, falsely accusing the Soviet Union's just trial of being a so-called "propaganda campaign." But what kind of "propaganda" is this? The U.S. State Department issued two consecutive statements before Powers' trial, clamoring that the Soviet Union had "concealed" something in the preparation for the trial, attempting to leave a loophole for the United States to deny the crime of espionage. However, the automatic detonation device on the U-2 plane failed to kill Powers, Powers himself did not use the poison needle, and Powers fully confessed the U.S. government's crimes of aggression in the Soviet court. Thus, it was not others, but precisely Powers, who served as a tool of the U.S. government, who "propagated" the U.S.'s crimes of aggression in the Soviet court.

Powers is just a victim of the U.S. imperialist war policy. The U-2 plane was shot down, Powers was captured, but the U.S. imperialism, which sent Powers to fly the U-2 plane to invade Soviet airspace, did not therefore lay down its butcher knife. Two months after the U-2 plane incident, the United States again sent an RB-47 aircraft to invade Soviet airspace, carrying out new provocations. The United States is also stepping up its deployment to expand espionage flight activities. According to the Paris "Liberation," the U.S. Department of Defense has formulated a new plan to supply its allies with a batch of spy planes, requiring these planes to fly along the Soviet border for reconnaissance, while the United States itself is responsible for spy flights that sneak into Soviet airspace. U.S. spy chief Allen Dulles recently visited Western Europe to plan this. At the same time, amid cries for expanding armaments and preparing for a "preemptive war," the U.S. Department of Defense announced the establishment of a central military planning agency dedicated to preparing for a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. The current U.S. Vice President, Nixon, who has been elected as the Republican presidential candidate for the next term, also openly clamored that the United States is "devising all the necessary new plans to win this major battle (against the socialist camp)." Are all these "Communist propaganda" again? All this precisely nakedly exposes that U.S. imperialism continues to adhere to its policy of aggression and its policy of war. The U.S. monopoly capitalist group will not abandon its national policy of eliminating socialist countries. However, the trial of Powers sternly warned U.S. imperialism: Any perpetrator who dares to carry out war provocations will sooner or later be justly tried and sanctioned in the people's court.

    美国政府在被告席上
    本报评论员
    苏联最高法院军事审判庭结束了对美国间谍飞行员鲍尔士的审讯，判决剥夺鲍尔士自由十年。这是对侵略成性的美帝国主义的一次正义审判，揭露了美帝国主义伪装和平、推行战争政策和侵略政策的强盗面目。
    在审讯过程中，美国间谍罪犯鲍尔士供认了他进行间谍活动，侵犯苏联主权的罪行。苏联最高法院军事审判庭的判决书指出，根据本案的材料和被告鲍尔士的供词确定，鲍尔士今年5月1日侵入苏联领空的犯罪飞行是早就经过周密准备的，其目的是破坏首脑会议，阻碍和缓国际紧张局势。判决书又指出，“被告鲍尔士执行的美国的侵略行为，造成了对普遍和平的威胁”。美帝国主义敌视社会主义阵营、敌视世界和平的好战本性和侵略野心，再一次在这次审判中暴露无遗了。
    在这次审判面前，美国政府陷于十分尴尬地位。在被告席上的，实际上是美国政府。在U—2间谍飞机被击落之后，美国政府抵赖不成，竟然宣布鲍尔士所干的黑色勾当，是美国的国策。对鲍尔士的审判也就是对美国政府的审判。“纽约邮报”说，“被俄国人置于被告席上的，当然是美国本身。我们（美国）的政府实际已经承认了它在进行间谍活动以及在对这一事件的拙劣处理方面是有罪的，我们受到了丧失威信和信心的惩罚”。
    艾森豪威尔对于他自己和他领导的政府所处的罪犯地位，极感不安。他的新闻秘书哈格蒂发表声明，反诬苏联的正义审判是所谓“宣传活动”。可是，这到底是什么样的“宣传”呢？美国国务院在鲍尔士受审前连续发表两次声明，叫嚷苏联在审讯准备工作中有所“隐瞒”，妄图为美国抵赖间谍罪行留下伏笔。但是U—2飞机上的自动爆炸装置未能杀掉鲍尔士，鲍尔士本人也没有使用毒针，鲍尔士在苏联的法庭上全部招供了美国政府的侵略罪行。这样，不是别人，而恰恰是充当了美国政府的工具的鲍尔士在苏联法庭上“宣传”了美国的侵略罪行。
    鲍尔士不过是美帝国主义战争政策的牺牲者。U—2飞机被击落了，鲍尔士被擒了，而派遣鲍尔士驾驶U—2飞机侵犯苏联领空的美帝国主义，并没有因此放下屠刀。U—2飞机事件后的两个月，美国又派遣了RB—47型飞机侵犯苏联领空，进行新的挑衅。美国还在加紧进行扩大间谍飞行活动的部署。据巴黎“解放报”透露，美国国防部拟订了新计划，将供给它的盟国一批间谍飞机，要这些飞机沿着苏联边境飞行，进行侦察，而由美国自己负责潜入苏联领空的间谍飞行。美国特务头子艾伦·杜勒斯最近曾为此到西欧进行了策划。与此同时，在一片扩军备战和发动“先发制人战争”的叫嚣声中，美国国防部宣布成立一个专门准备对苏联发动核进攻的中央军事计划机构。现在的美国副总统、当选为下一届的共和党总统候选人的尼克松，也公开叫嚷说，美国正在“制订出一切必要的新计划来打胜这场（针对社会主义阵营的）大战役”。所有这些，难道又是什么“共产党宣传”吗？这一切，恰恰是赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义继续坚持侵略政策和战争政策。美国垄断资本集团是不会放弃它消灭社会主义国家的国策的。可是，对鲍尔士的审讯，严正地警告了美帝国主义：任何敢于进行战争挑衅的凶犯，迟早终将在人民法庭面前，受到正义的审判和制裁。
