Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 6th - Cadres at all levels in Yixian County, Hebei Province, have gone deep into the front lines and universally adopted the method of summarizing and promoting advanced experiences to lead production, achieving remarkable results.

Since Yixian County implemented the "Two-Five System" leadership method in March of this year, the county has transferred a total of 1,820 cadres at all levels, adopting the methods of division of labor, contract responsibility at fixed points, and all-inclusive responsibility to go deep into the front lines of production. In order to give full play to the role of these cadres in strengthening leadership on the front lines, the Yixian County Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted an investigation and study on how they could lead production through participation in production. Shi Shuangqi, the first secretary of the County Committee, discovered during an investigation in the Tiangong Temple Commune that there were significant differences in the effectiveness of the work due to the different working methods of the cadres. At that time, it was a tense period of combating drought to water wheat and combat drought to plant spring crops. Lü Weixin, the deputy secretary of the Commune Party Committee responsible for the Shunheying Production Team of this commune, paid great attention to grasping ideological education and positive factors while working, living, and eating with the masses. In the process of watering wheat, he successively mobilized the masses to summarize and promote advanced experiences such as "multi-well convergence irrigation" and "installing shaking frames on five-wheel waterwheels, using shaking cars to draw water instead of human-powered waterwheels." All 689 mu of wheat in the team were watered thoroughly in just four days. However, the commune cadre Shi Bo, who lived in the Liyuzhuang Production Team, was also very active in his work, but he only buried himself in work, urged for progress figures, and did not pay attention to arranging work and relying on the masses to summarize and promote their experiences. Therefore, although the 720 mu of wheat in the team had the same conditions as the Shunheying Production Team, they struggled for five days and watered less than half of it. This fact, along with similar situations learned by other members of the County Committee, made the County Committee clear about the following issue: cadres going to the countryside to stay at fixed points only solved the first step of going deep into work. To better strengthen leadership over grassroots work, it also depends on what methods are used to lead production and how to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses. In order to solve this problem, the County Committee held on-site leadership method comparison meetings in Shunheying and Liyuzhuang, promoted Lü Weixin's leadership experience of guiding work by summarizing experiences, and, on the basis of implementing the "Two-Five System," proposed the "Five In-depths" and "Five Specifics" working methods to all cadres going to the countryside (namely, go deep among the masses, specifically grasp the ideological situation of the masses, and strengthen political and ideological education; conduct in-depth investigation and research, grasp positive factors, and specifically summarize and promote advanced experiences by relying on the masses; go deep into the front lines of production, specifically help grassroots cadres and improve leadership level; go deep into the fields, and specifically solve key problems hindering production in a targeted manner through participation in production; go deep into the canteens and specifically help arrange the lives of the masses), and listed the method of summarizing and promoting advanced experiences and guiding work as a condition for evaluating "Five-Good" cadres, and launched a comparison and competition movement among all cadres going to the countryside to see who relied on the masses to summarize the most experiences, promote them quickly, and had the best leadership methods. In this movement, the County Committee also adopted six measures of learning, leading, explaining, contracting, transmitting, and helping in response to the "superstition" thinking that some cadres had about summarizing work. Learn: that is, mobilize cadres at all levels to study the Party's policies and guidelines, study the masses' production practice knowledge and experience, first be good students of the masses, and then be teachers of the masses, and use the method of summarizing the masses' practical experience to guide production; Lead: that is, secretaries at all levels take the lead in summarizing experience, setting an example, and guiding the general; Explain: that is, use various occasions and vivid facts to explain the benefits of summarizing and promoting advanced experience; Contract: that is, establish writing research groups, and those who can write and those who cannot write sign contract teaching agreements to help each other; Transmit: that is, invite cadres with experience in summarizing work to impart their experience; Help: that is, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, organize collaboration, and help each other. After the implementation of the six measures, a new situation quickly emerged throughout the county where everyone from the first secretary of the County Committee to the general cadres of the management district went deep into the base points to dissect "sparrows" and everyone started to summarize and promote advanced experience.

In order to ensure that the method of summarizing experience and guiding work closely revolved around the most critical agricultural work in the local area, various places adopted the approach of "the Party Committee proposing topics, everyone writing articles, everyone moving together from top to bottom, and focusing all efforts on overcoming key points," and organized cadres to go deep into work in a planned and purposeful manner, summarizing and promoting advanced experiences that played the most effective role in current production, and promoting the high-speed leap forward of various productions. This year, most of Yixian County's spring and summer crops were sown under conditions of extreme drought. After several replantings, the growth of the crops varied greatly. Therefore, after completing the sowing of large-scale field crops, how to effectively strengthen the field management of various crops, promote late seedlings to catch up with early seedlings, and promote weak seedlings to catch up with strong seedlings, has become the key to winning a comprehensive bumper harvest in the autumn. In order to do this work well, the County Committee put forward the requirement to the whole Party to "concentrate superior forces, launch an overproduction competition, and strive for high standards and high quality in field management." Cadres at all levels going to the countryside focused on this topic, mobilized the masses to offer suggestions and plans. In just three days, 120,000 big-character posters were posted throughout the county, proposing more than 1,200 suggestions. While extensively mobilizing the masses, cadres at all levels went deep into key areas to dissect "sparrows" and successively mobilized the masses to summarize 87 advanced experiences in tapping labor potential, rationally using labor, tool reform, skillfully pressing green manure and skillfully applying fertilizer, and improving leadership methods. The County Committee adopted various forms to promote these advanced experiences, according to their importance, the size of their universal significance, and the urgency of their timeliness, throughout the county or in the scope of the commune and management district, making the agricultural overproduction competition movement centered on field management develop both enthusiastically and solidly.

By summarizing and promoting advanced experience, cadres going to the countryside not only enhanced their understanding of production practice, making their work more and more meticulous, but also helped grassroots cadres improve their ability to lead production. At the same time, it enhanced the ability of cadres at all levels to summarize work and identify problems. (Attached picture)

    改进领导方法　提高领导水平的一个好办法
    易县干部深入第一线总结推广先进经验
    新华社天津6日电　河北省易县各级干部深入第一线以后，普遍运用总结和推广先进经验的方法领导生产，收到了显著效果。
    易县从今年3月推行“二五制”领导方法以来，全县共抽调一千八百二十名各级干部，采取分工包干、蹲点包干、一包到底的办法，深入生产第一线。为了充分发挥这些干部加强第一线领导的作用，中共易县县委就他们怎样通过参加生产领导生产的问题，作了调查研究。县委第一书记石双琪在深入天宫寺公社调查时发现：因为干部工作方法不同，表现在工作效果上，却有很大差异。当时正处在抗旱浇麦、抗旱春播的紧张时期，包这个社顺和营生产队的公社党委副书记吕维新，在和群众“四同”中，非常注意抓思想教育，抓积极因素，在浇麦中，先后发动群众总结推广了“多井汇浇”、“五轮水车安摇架，用晃车抽水代替人推水车”等先进经验，全队六百八十九亩小麦，只用四天时间就普浇一遍。可是住在李郁庄生产队的公社干部史伯，工作也很积极，但只是埋头干活，催要进度数字，不注意安排工作和依靠群众总结推广群众的经验，因此全队七百二十亩小麦，虽然同顺和营生产队条件相同，苦战了五天，浇了还不到一半。从这个事实和其他县委委员了解到的类似情况中，使县委明确了这样一个问题：干部下乡蹲点，只是解决了深入工作的第一步，要更好地加强对基层工作的领导，还在于用什么方法来领导生产，怎样把群众的干劲和智慧充分调动起来。为了解决这个问题，县委在顺和营、李郁庄召开了领导方法对比现场会议，推广了吕维新用总结经验办法指导工作的领导经验，并在贯彻“二五制”的基础上，向全体下乡干部提出了“五深入”“五具体”的工作方法（即深入群众，具体掌握群众思想情况，加强政治思想教育；深入调查研究，抓积极因素，依靠群众具体总结推广先进经验；深入生产第一线，具体帮助基层干部，提高领导水平；深入田间，通过参加生产，有的放矢地具体解决阻碍生产的关键问题；深入食堂，具体帮助安排好群众生活），并把总结推广先进经验、指导工作的方法，列为“五好”干部的评比条件，发动全体下乡干部展开了“看谁依靠群众总结经验多，推广快，领导方法好”的评比竞赛运动。在这一运动中，县委还针对部分干部对总结工作存在的“迷信”思想，采取学、带、讲、包、传、帮六字措施。学：就是发动各级干部学习党的方针政策，学习群众的生产实践知识和经验，先当好群众的学生，再当群众的先生，用总结群众实践经验的办法，指导生产；带：就是各级书记以身作则，带头总结经验，树立榜样，指导一般；讲：就是利用各种场合，用活的事实，讲解总结推广先进经验的好处；包：就是建立写作研究小组，能写的和不会写的订立包教合同，互相帮助；传：就是请有总结工作经验的干部，传授经验；帮：就是取长补短，组织协作，互相帮助。六字措施推行后，全县很快出现了一个上至县委第一书记，下至管理区一般干部，人人深入基点解剖“麻雀”，个个动手总结推广先进经验的新局面。
    为了使总结经验、指导工作的方法，紧紧围绕当地当前最关键性的农活来进行，各地采取了“党委出课题，大家作文章，上下一齐动，全力攻关键”的作法，有计划有目的地组织干部深入工作，总结推广对当前生产最起作用的先进经验，推动了各项生产高速度跃进。今年，易县的春夏作物，大部分是在异常干旱的情况下播种的，有的播种后经过几次查苗补苗，作物生长情况相差悬殊，因此在完成大田作物播种后，如何切实加强各种作物田间管理，促晚苗赶早苗，促弱苗赶壮苗，便成了当前夺取秋季全面丰产的关键。为了作好这一工作，县委向全党提出了“集中优势兵力，开展超产赛，力争田间管理高标准、高质量”的要求。各级下乡干部围绕这一课题，发动群众献计献策，只三天时间，全县就贴出大字报十二万张，提出各种建议一千二百多条。各级干部在广泛发动群众的同时，深入重点，解剖“麻雀”，先后发动群众总结出挖掘劳力潜力、合理使用劳力、工具改革、巧压绿肥巧追肥、改进领导方法等先进经验八十七件。县委对这些先进经验，按照重要程度、普遍意义的大小和时间性的急缓，采取多种形式，在全县或公社、管理区范围普遍推广，使全县以田间管理为中心的农业超产竞赛运动开展得既热烈又扎实。
    下乡干部通过总结推广先进经验，不仅增强了对生产实践的了解，使工作越做越细致；还帮助基层干部提高了领导生产的本领。同时增强了各级干部总结工作、识别问题的能力。（附图片）
