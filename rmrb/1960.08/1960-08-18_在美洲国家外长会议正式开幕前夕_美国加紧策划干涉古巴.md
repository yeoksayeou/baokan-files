　　Xinhua News Agency, San José, August 17th: The meeting of foreign ministers of the member states of the Organization of American States held a thirty-minute preparatory meeting on the afternoon of the 16th. At the meeting, the foreign ministers of Costa Rica and Chile were elected as the chairman and vice-chairman of the meeting, respectively. The formal opening meeting is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 17th.

　　After arriving in San José on the 16th, U.S. Secretary of State Herter immediately engaged in intense behind-the-scenes activities, widely contacting the foreign ministers of other countries attending the meeting, seeking support for the U.S. plan to invade Cuba. According to reports, in his talks with the foreign ministers of Latin American countries, Herter, in the name of safeguarding the "principles of freedom" in the Western Hemisphere, asked them to participate in the U.S.-planned further intervention in Cuba.

　　According to Agence France-Presse, the United States has already distributed among the Latin American delegations a copy of a U.S.-made draft resolution to create a basis for intervention in Cuba. This draft resolution creates a pretext for intervention, demanding the strengthening of so-called "Pan-American solidarity" in the face of the so-called "threat of communist infiltration from countries outside the American continent."

　　On the 16th, Herter also went to the Colombian Embassy in Costa Rica to discuss the proposal to be put forward by Colombian Foreign Minister Turbay regarding Venezuela's accusation against the Dominican Republic. Venezuela had accused the Dominican Republic's dictatorial government of assassinating Venezuelan President Betancourt and demanded severe sanctions against it. According to reports, this proposal suggests the appointment of an Inter-American Supervisory Committee to oversee the so-called "free elections" in the Dominican Republic.

　　According to Agence France-Presse, this proposal contains a U.S. conspiracy to create a precedent for launching armed intervention against Cuba. The news agency said that according to this proposal, the Inter-American Supervisory Committee can dispatch troops from the Organization of American States, controlled by the United States, to the Dominican Republic. The news pointed out that for the United States, the "advantage" of this proposal is that it can both "guarantee the stability of the Dominican Republic" and prevent the uprising of the Dominican people, and "create a precedent that may become a serious warning to the Cuban government." At the same time, it must be pointed out that holding so-called "free elections" supervised by the United States is precisely a means by which the United States has consistently attempted to subvert the Cuban revolutionary government.

### 在美洲国家外长会议正式开幕前夕  美国加紧策划干涉古巴

    在美洲国家外长会议正式开幕前夕
    美国加紧策划干涉古巴
    新华社17日讯　圣约瑟消息：美洲国家组织成员国外长会议在16日下午举行了三十分钟的预备会议。会上选出哥斯达黎加和智利的外交部长分别担任这次会议的正副主席。正式开幕会议定于17日上午举行。
    美国国务卿赫脱在16日到达圣约瑟以后，立即进行了紧张的幕后活动，同参加会议的其他国家外交部长广泛接触，为美国侵略古巴的计划寻求支持。据报道，赫脱在同拉丁美洲国家外交部长进行的会谈中，曾经以维护西半球的“自由原则”为名，要求他们参与美国策划的进一步干涉古巴的行动。
    据法新社透露，美国已经在拉丁美洲代表团中间散发了一项为干涉古巴制造根据的美制决议草案副本，这项决议草案制造干涉的借口，要求在所谓“美洲大陆以外的国家进行共产主义渗入的威胁面前”，加强所谓“泛美团结”。
    赫脱在16日还到哥伦比亚驻哥斯达黎加大使馆，讨论了将由哥伦比亚外交部长图尔拜出面就委内瑞拉对多米尼加的控诉提出的提案。委内瑞拉曾经控诉多米尼加独裁政府谋刺委内瑞拉总统贝坦科尔特，并且要求对它进行严厉制裁。据报道，这项提案建议任命一个美洲监察委员会，来负责监督在多米尼加举行所谓“自由选举”。
    据法新社透露，这项提案中包藏着美国企图制造一个先例以便对古巴发动武装干涉的阴谋。这家通讯社的消息说，根据这项提案，美洲监察委员会可以派遣由美国控制的美洲国家组织的军队到多米尼加去。消息指出，对美国说来，这项提案的“优点”，是既可以“保证多米尼加的稳定”、防止多米尼加人民的起义，又“可以造成一个可能成为对古巴政府的严重警告的先例”。同时必须指出，举行由美国派人监督的所谓“自由选举”，正是美国一贯企图用来颠复古巴革命政府的一种手段。
