Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 17th:

    Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's output of major products such as iron, steel, steel materials, and coke generally increased in the first half of August. Compared with the same period last month, steel increased by 16.6%, iron increased by 14.6%, steel materials increased by 66.4%, and coke increased by 18.4% in the first half of August. Furthermore, the quality of various products has also significantly improved.

    Since August, workers at this company, in response to the high sulfur content in pig iron during steelmaking, have launched a joint technical performance competition craze aimed at fiercely tackling the high-sulfur barrier and producing high-speed, high-quality steel. Through competition, they learned from each other's strengths, compensated for weaknesses, and widely exchanged advanced experiences, giving greater power to new technologies and experiences. Workers at No. 2 Youth Furnace in Converter Plant No. 1 launched a "hook-up competition" with lining workers, which led to the converter furnace lifespan being extended by more than double. Workers at Converter Plant No. 4 created an advanced integrated desulfurization experience, which quickly became a highly effective sulfur-tackling measure throughout the company.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 17th:

    Workers at the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation Steelmaking Plant are working together to seize high output and ensure that August surpasses July. The steel they produced in the first half of this month increased by more than 20% compared with the same period in July.

    In August, the leading cadres of this plant continued to go deep into the front line of production, working with the workers to eliminate weak links in production. Workers at each open hearth furnace launched a competition to learn from and catch up with advanced workers. Workers at No. 1 open hearth furnace overcame the most troublesome water jacket handling issues in the past, increased furnace temperature, and adopted the method of tightening cooperation link by link, which greatly shortened the time for sintering the furnace bottom, overfulfilled the work plan for the first ten days of the month by nineteen tons, and the steel qualification rate was as high as 99.81%. After hearing the good news of the increased output of No. 1 open hearth furnace, workers at No. 4 open hearth furnace immediately strove to catch up, and with the assistance of workers at No. 1 open hearth furnace, they achieved the goal of common improvement.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 17th:

    Compared with July, the average daily production level of workers at the Huangshi Daye Steel Plant in the first half of August increased by 20.2% for steel, 40.8% for steel materials, and 31.4% for pig iron; the quality of major products such as open hearth steel, converter steel, and steel materials also greatly improved compared with the previous month.

    To meet the need to increase raw materials after the increase in steel production, the workers of Daye Steel Plant strengthened contact with relevant departments to achieve prompt and fast transportation; on the one hand, they relied on their own efforts, tapped potentials and practiced economy, and vigorously carried out the recycling and utilization of scrap steel and scrap iron. They also accelerated the construction of blast furnaces, so that a 100-cubic-meter blast furnace was put into production in early August, which can produce more than 100 tons of iron per day. In order to use high-sulfur iron to make steel, the secretary and deputy secretary of the plant's Party committee personally led cadres from various departments to participate in production beside the converters, organizing forces inside and outside the plant to besiege high sulfur, so that the quality of steel continued to improve.

Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, August 17th:

    Workers at Tangshan Steel Plant concentrated their efforts to fiercely tackle key production areas. In the first half of August, the daily output of steel ingots increased by 2.01% compared with the same period in July, the average qualification rate of steel ingots reached 97.5%, and the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel decreased by ten kilograms compared with July.

    In order to vigorously grasp various measures to increase steel production and fiercely tackle key production areas, the Party committee of Tangshan Steel Plant organized a steelmaking production headquarters, focusing on the second steelmaking workshop, and mobilized the plant's manpower and resources to support steelmaking. The secretary and director of the Party committee both went deep into the front line of production to settle down and take root, adopting the six-pronged approach of grasping ideology, grasping weak links, grasping advanced experience, grasping competition, grasping management, and grasping life to increase steel production. After the secretary of the plant's Party committee went deep into production, he and the workers studied the key issue of frequent accidents in the No. 4 melting furnace affecting production, and quickly found a solution.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 17th:

    Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant achieved outstanding results in high output, high quality, and low consumption in the first half of August. Compared with the same period in July, steel production increased by 45.1%; the qualification rate of steel reached over 96%, an increase of 3.2% compared with July; the average consumption of pig iron per ton of steel decreased by 141 kilograms compared with July.

    In the mass movement of learning from, catching up with, surpassing, and creating advanced indicators to strive for "five firsts," more than 200 groups of workers at this plant have signed competition contracts with groups of workers in the same trade inside and outside the plant. Workers in Class Three of Branch Plant One, who were rated as an advanced unit in the city in July, launched a heated competition. Workers in Class A have repeatedly set new class production records since August, overfulfilling the plan every day. Classes B and C were not to be outdone, chasing and catching up fiercely, and both output and quality continued to rise. Because workers in the three classes strove to be upstream, they created the plant's highest daily output record on August 7th.

    领导干部切切实实抓措施　广大职工轰轰烈烈闹竞赛
    钢铁企业优质高产全面跃进
    重庆钢铁公司
    据新华社重庆17日电　重庆钢铁公司8月上半月钢铁钢材和焦炭等主要产品的产量普遍增长。8月上半月同上月同期比较，钢增长16.6％，铁增长14.6％，钢材增长66.4％，焦炭增长18.4％，而且各种产品质量也都有显著提高。
    8月份以来，这个公司职工针对炼钢中生铁含硫率较高的情况，掀起了一个以猛攻高硫关、大炼快速优质钢为目标的联合技术表演竞赛热潮。通过竞赛互相取长补短，广泛交流先进经验，使新技术和新经验发挥了更大的威力。转炉一厂二号青年炉吹炼工人同制衬工人展开“挂钩赛”，促使转炉炉龄延长了一倍以上。转炉四厂职工创造了一条龙综合脱硫先进经验，很快就变成了全公司的一种极为有效的攻硫措施。
    武钢炼钢厂
    据新华社武汉17日电　武钢炼钢厂职工同心协力夺高产，保证8月超7月。他们在本月上半月炼出的钢，比7月同期增多了20％以上。
    这个厂的领导干部8月份继续坚持深入生产第一线，同职工一道消除生产中的薄弱环节。各平炉职工展开了学先进赶先进的竞赛。一号平炉工人攻破了过去最伤脑筋的水套处理关，提高了炉温，并且采用环环扣紧加强协作的办法，使烧结炉底的时间大大缩短，超额十九吨完成了上旬作业计划，钢的合格率高达99.81％。四号平炉工人听到一号平炉产量上升的喜讯以后，立即奋力追赶，在一号平炉工人的协助下，达到了共同提高的目的。
    大冶钢厂
    据新华社武汉17日电　黄石市大冶钢厂职工8月上半月的平均日产水平和7月份相比，钢增长20.2％、钢材增长40.8％、生铁增长31.4％；平炉钢、转炉钢和钢材等主要产品质量也都比上月有很大的提高。
    适应钢产量提高后需要增加原料的情况，大冶钢厂职工们一面加强与有关部门联系，做到勤提快运；一方面自力更生，开源节流，大搞废钢、废铁回收利用。他们还加速高炉的建设，使一座一百立方米的高炉在8月上旬投入了生产，每天可多产生铁一百多吨。为了利用高硫铁炼钢，厂党委书记、副书记亲自率领科室干部，深入到转炉旁参加生产，组织厂内外的力量围攻高硫，使钢的质量不断提高。
    唐山钢厂
    据新华社唐山17日电　唐山钢厂职工集中力量，猛攻生产关键，8月上半月钢锭日产量比7月同期增长2.01％，钢锭合格率平均达到97.5％，每吨钢的生铁消耗量比7月份降低十公斤。
    唐山钢厂党委为了狠抓提高钢产量的各项措施，猛攻生产关键，8月份以来以第二炼钢车间为重点组织了炼钢生产指挥部，调动全厂人力物力支援炼钢。党委书记、厂长都深入生产第一线安家落户，采取抓思想、抓薄弱环节、抓先进经验、抓竞赛、抓管理、抓生活的六抓方法，提高钢的产量。厂党委书记深入生产后，针对四号化铁炉经常发生事故影响生产的关键，和职工一起研究，很快找到了解决办法。
    天津第二钢厂
    据新华社天津17日电　天津市第二钢厂8月上半月创高产优质低消耗的优异成绩，与7月同期比较，钢产量增长45.1％；钢的合格率达到96％以上，比7月提高了3.2％；每吨钢的生铁消耗量平均比7月份降低一百四十一公斤。
    这个厂职工在学、赶、超、创先进指标力争“五个第一”的群众运动中，已有二百多个小组与厂内外同工种的小组签订了竞赛合同。7月份被评为全市先进单位的一分厂三班工人展开了热烈的竞赛。甲班工人8月以来连创班产新纪录，天天超额完成计划。乙、丙两班也不示弱，猛追猛赶，产量、质量也都不断上升。由于三班工人力争上游，在8月7日创造了本厂日产量最高纪录。
