Xinhua News Agency report: The meeting of foreign ministers of the member states of the Organization of American States opened on August 16 in San José, the capital of Costa Rica. On the eve of the meeting, public opinion in Latin American countries condemned the U.S. imperialist plot to use the Organization of American States to strangle the Cuban revolution and expressed support for the Cuban people's struggle.

    The Cuban "Revolución" published an editorial on the 12th pointing out that the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas will once again demonstrate the lawless and inhumane nature of U.S. imperialism. The editorial said that the U.S. government will attend the meeting armed with dollars, bribes, and subversion.

    The newspaper pointed out that because the Cuban people resisted U.S. exploitation and tyranny, the U.S. rulers are trying to destroy it. The U.S. government now wants to plot new conspiracies in the Organization of American States—its colonial secretariat—with the obvious aim of isolating the Cuban revolution.

    "Revolución" emphasized that the U.S. government is the number one destroyer of international agreements and principles. The only threat to Latin America is U.S. imperialism's threat to the people of Latin American countries, and the only intervention is U.S. imperialism's intervention in the fate of Latin America.

    "Revolución" said that Cuba will attend the meeting to lodge accusations and to issue the voice of the Latin American people.

    In a statement issued on the 9th, the Political Committee of the Chilean Communist Party condemned the U.S. government for conspiring to use the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Member States of the Organization of American States to "brutally crush the democratic anti-imperialist government of Cuba and suppress the national forces of Latin America."

    The statement said that the Cuban revolution reflects the aspirations of Latin America and is supported by the people of all countries.

    The leadership committee of the United Workers' Union of Chile also issued a statement. The statement said that the United Workers' Union of Chile firmly supports and assists the Cuban government and people in their great struggle to get rid of the shackles of imperialism and turn Cuba into a free and sovereign land.

    The Chilean National Peace Committee issued a statement reiterating its support for Cuba and calling on people to fight to strengthen Cuba's sovereignty. The statement emphasized: "Defending Cuba is defending world peace and the freedom of Latin America."

    In a statement published in various newspapers on the 9th, the Costa Rican People's Vanguard Party condemned the conspiracy to turn the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of American States into a tool for interfering in Cuba. The statement said that we oppose this conspiracy and call on the Costa Rican people to rise up and fight.

    According to reports in the Costa Rican "La Prensa Libre" and "El Tiempo," many slogans reading "Cuba yes, Yankees no" were found in San José.

    The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Venezuela issued a statement saying that the United States is attempting to repeat at this meeting the conspiracy of the late U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to instigate the armed subversion of the Arbenz government of Guatemala at the Caracas Pan-American Conference in 1954. The statement called on "Act for Cuba and Venezuela!"

    The Ecuadorian Communist Party's newspaper "El Pueblo" recently published a statement by the Ecuadorian Communist Party exposing the U.S. instigation to convene the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas, attempting to use the net of various treaties and resolutions to invade the Cuban people who are fighting for democracy and national sovereignty.

    The statement said, "The Cuban Revolution has begun the struggle for complete independence in Latin America," and called on the Ecuadorian people and all Latin American brothers who love democracy and self-determination to support the Cuban people, defend Cuban sovereignty, and oppose U.S. imperialist aggression.

    The Uruguayan Wool Workers' Union, the Textile Workers' Union, the Construction Workers' Union, and the Communist Youth League jointly issued a statement condemning the U.S. conspiracy to use the Organization of American States to invade Cuba. The statement pointed out that U.S. monopoly organizations and their loyal servants in Latin American countries are very uneasy about the example that the Cuban people have set in their heroic struggle against big business, and oppose the measures taken by the Cuban revolutionary government to transfer American companies into Cuban hands.

    The statement pointed out that in order to prevent U.S. imperialism from suppressing Cuba at any time, they should be vigilant at all times.

    The leadership committees of the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Uruguay also recently issued a statement on the upcoming Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas, emphasizing that all countries enjoy the inviolable right to the principle of self-determination, expressing opposition to any aggression against Cuba—whether economic or military—and requiring the Uruguayan government to support the principle of non-interference.

    In a telegram sent to Cuban Prime Minister Castro on the 10th, the City Council of Conquista, Brazil, expressed support for the Cuban Revolution. The telegram said that the people of the City of Conquista enthusiastically support the Cuban people's great struggle full of ideals and strength.

    The Bolivian "El Pueblo" recently published an article revealing that the United States has issued urgent instructions to its embassies in Latin American countries, requiring them to force Latin American governments to support the U.S. "condemnation" of Cuba at the San José Foreign Ministers' Meeting. "El Pueblo" demanded that the Bolivian government reject the pressure exerted by the United States.

    不许美帝国主义利用美洲国家组织作侵略工具
    拉丁美洲公众舆论支持古巴人民斗争
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美洲国家组织成员国外长会议已于8月16日在哥斯达黎加首都圣约瑟开幕。在会议召开前夕，拉丁美洲国家公众舆论纷纷谴责美帝国主义企图利用美洲国家组织来扼杀古巴革命的阴谋，并且表示支持古巴人民的斗争。
    古巴“革命报”12日发表社论指出，美洲外长会议将再次表明美帝国主义无法无天和非人道的性质。社论说，美国政府将配备着美元、贿赂和颠复的武装去参加会议。
    这家报纸指出，由于古巴人民对美国的剥削和专横进行了反抗，美国统治者就企图摧毁它。美国政府现在要在美洲国家组织——它的殖民秘书处去策划新的阴谋，其目的显然是孤立古巴革命。
    “革命报”强调指出，美国政府是国际协定和原则的头号破坏者。拉丁美洲存在的唯一威胁就是美帝国主义对拉丁美洲各国人民的威胁，唯一的干涉就是美帝国主义对拉丁美洲命运的干涉。
    “革命报”说，古巴将去参加会议，去进行控诉，去发出拉丁美洲人民的声音。
    智利共产党政治委员会在9日发表的一项声明中，谴责美国政府正在阴谋利用美洲国家组织成员国外长会议来“残暴地摧残古巴的民主反帝政府和镇压拉丁美洲的民族力量”。
    声明说，古巴革命反映了拉丁美洲的热望，并且得到各国人民的支持。
    智利工人统一工会领导委员会也发表一项声明。声明说，智利工人统一工会坚决支持和援助古巴政府和人民为摆脱帝国主义的枷锁和把古巴变成自由和主权的土地而进行的巨大斗争。
    智利全国和平委员会发表声明重申对古巴的支援，并且号召人们为加强古巴的主权而斗争。声明强调说：“保卫古巴就是保卫世界的和平和拉丁美洲的自由。”
    哥斯达黎加人民先锋党9日在给各报发表的声明中谴责企图把美洲国家组织外长会议变成一个干涉古巴的工具的阴谋。声明说，我们反对这个阴谋，并号召哥斯达黎加人民起来斗争。
    据哥斯达黎加“自由新闻报”和“时报”报道，在圣约瑟发现了许多写着“要古巴，不要美国佬”的标语口号。
    委内瑞拉共产党中央委员会政治局发表声明说，美国企图在这次会议上重演美国已故国务卿杜勒斯1954年在加拉加斯泛美会议上策动武装颠复危地马拉阿本斯政府的阴谋。声明号召“为了古巴和委内瑞拉，行动起来！”
    厄瓜多尔共产党机关报“人民报”最近登载了厄瓜多尔共产党的一项声明，揭露美国策动召开美洲外长会议，是企图利用各种条约和决议的罗网来侵略为争取民主和国家主权而斗争的古巴人民。
    声明说，“古巴革命在拉丁美洲开始了争取彻底独立的斗争”，声明号召厄瓜多尔人民和一切爱好民主和自决权的拉丁美洲兄弟支援古巴人民，保卫古巴主权，反对美帝国主义的侵略。
    乌拉圭羊毛工人联合会、纺织工人联合会、建筑工人联合会、共产主义青年联盟联合发表声明，谴责美国阴谋利用美洲国家组织侵略古巴。声明指出，美国垄断组织和它们在拉丁美洲国家的忠实奴仆们，对古巴人民在同大托辣斯进行英勇斗争中做出了范例这一点感到非常不安，并且反对古巴革命政府所采取的把美国人的企业转交到古巴人手里的措施。
    声明指出，为了随时阻止美帝国主义镇压古巴，他们应当时刻戒备着。
    乌拉圭大学法学院和社会科学院学生的领导委员会最近也就即将举行的美洲外长会议发表声明，强调指出各国人民享有对于自决原则的不可侵犯的权利，表示反对对古巴的任何侵略——无论是经济侵略还是军事侵略，并且要求乌拉圭政府支持不干涉原则。
    巴西孔基斯塔市议会在10日发给古巴总理卡斯特罗的一封电报中，表示支持古巴革命。电报说，孔基斯塔市的人民热情地支持古巴人民充满着理想和力量的巨大斗争。
    玻利维亚“人民报”最近发表文章揭露，美国已经对它的驻拉丁美洲各国大使馆发出紧急指示，要求它们迫使拉丁美洲各国政府在圣约瑟外长会议上支持美国对古巴的“谴责”。“人民报”要求玻利维亚政府拒绝美国所施加的压力。
