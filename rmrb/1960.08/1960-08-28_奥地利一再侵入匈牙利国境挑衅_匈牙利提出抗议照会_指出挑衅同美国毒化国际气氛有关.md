    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 27th: The Hungarian News Agency was authorized on the 26th to issue a communique regarding a series of provocative activities by Austria that violated the Hungarian border.

    The communique states that on August 21, 1960, on the Hungarian-Austrian border, an Austrian customs inspector, carrying weapons, intruded into Hungarian territory and provoked a Hungarian patrol. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already issued a protest note to the Austrian Legation in Budapest regarding this border violation incident.

    The communique states that this kind of border violation is not an isolated incident. In recent weeks, a series of blatant provocative activities violating the Hungarian border have occurred on the Austrian side. For example, on August 6, in the Valborg area, three Austrian customs inspectors intruded into Hungarian territory, kidnapped a local resident named Piroshka across the border, and then took him away in a car waiting in Austrian territory.

    The communique states that the above examples clearly show that these border violation incidents are not accidental, but rather organized activities serving certain political purposes.

    The communique states that it is worth noting that the number and severity of provocative incidents on the Austrian side violating the Hungarian border have increased since US Undersecretary of State Dillon visited Austria in the second half of July 1960. The most recent provocative act occurred on August 21, the same day that the US representative to the United Nations suggested including the so-called "Hungarian question" on the agenda of the next session of the United Nations General Assembly, which cannot be considered a coincidence either. The communique states that obviously, the purpose of the above-mentioned border violation activities is to poison the international atmosphere, and it is an integral part of the Cold War activities being carried out on an international scale. The communique states that it is regrettable that certain Austrian organizations are also actively assisting in these conspiracies. The above events prove that on more than one occasion, Austrian officials themselves have acted as tools of this Cold War activity.

### 奥地利一再侵入匈牙利国境挑衅  匈牙利提出抗议照会  指出挑衅同美国毒化国际气氛有关

    奥地利一再侵入匈牙利国境挑衅
    匈牙利提出抗议照会
    指出挑衅同美国毒化国际气氛有关
    据新华社布达佩斯27日电　匈牙利通讯社26日受权就奥地利方面侵犯匈牙利国境的一系列的挑衅活动发表了公报。
    公报中说，1960年8月21日，在匈奥边界上，一个奥地利关税监察员带着武器侵入匈牙利国境，并对匈牙利巡逻队进行了挑衅。匈牙利外交部已经就这一侵犯边界事件向奥地利驻布达佩斯公使馆发出了抗议照会。
    公报说，这种侵犯边界的事件已不只是一次了。在最近几周内，奥地利方面发生了一系列、粗暴地侵犯匈牙利边界的挑衅活动。例如，8月6日，在瓦尔博洛格地区有三个奥地利关税监察员侵入匈牙利国境，把当地居民皮罗什卡劫夺过边界，然后用等候在奥地利境内的汽车把他带走。
    公报说，上述例子清楚地表明，这些侵犯边界事件不是偶然的，而是服务于一定政治目的的、有组织的活动。
    公报说，值得注意的是，奥地利方面侵犯匈牙利边境的挑衅事件就其发生的次数和严重程度来看，自从美国副国务卿狄龙在1960年7月下半月访问奥地利以来有所增加。最近这次挑衅行为正是发生在美国驻联合国代表建议把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入联合国下届大会议程的那天，即8月21日，这也不能认为是偶然的。公报说，显然，上述这些侵犯边境的活动的目的是为了毒化国际气氛，它是在国际范围内进行冷战活动的组成部分。公报说，遗憾的是某些奥地利组织也积极地协助这些阴谋活动。上述事件证明不只一次地是奥地利官方人员本身充当了这种冷战活动的工具。
