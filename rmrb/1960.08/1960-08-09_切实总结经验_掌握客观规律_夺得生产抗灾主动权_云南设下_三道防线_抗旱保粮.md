Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 8th: The people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province are actively implementing the strategic thinking of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee to establish "three lines of defense" and strive for a good harvest in the face of drought. They have overcome a severe drought that lasted for more than seven months and successfully completed the transplanting of mid-season rice. The corn planting plan has also been overfulfilled by more than 1.9 million mu ahead of schedule. On the basis of the planting victory, the commune members of all ethnic groups have launched a high tide of field management centered on weeding.

At present, the severe drought that has lasted for seven consecutive months has been relieved. The entire Yunnan Plateau, from south to north, is a sea of green. Drought-resistant spring grain crops have been planted on more than 35 million mu. As the first line of defense, the backbone of this year's grain production, namely 20 million mu of high-yielding basic farmland, has been planted according to plan during the most favorable season. Deep plowing, sun-curing fallow land, close planting, and fertilization measures have all been implemented according to relatively advanced standards to ensure the quality of planting. The successful completion of the planting of these basic farmlands, which plays a decisive role in the autumn harvest, has greatly encouraged the commune members of all ethnic groups in the province. Various localities have then taken advantage of the victory to quickly shift to the rush planting of the second line of defense (20 million mu of general farmland) and the third line of defense (late autumn crops), so that the planting plan for the entire three lines of defense has been proactive step by step. As early as the end of June, the province had completed 96% of the planting plan for the first to third lines of defense. This year, the old rule of planting first and then managing was further broken, and planting and management were carried out simultaneously. By the time the planting was basically completed, 2 million laborers across the province had shifted to weeding basic farmland. At present, more than 20 million mu of rice and corn in the first two lines of defense have been weeded, and the progress and quality of weeding are better than in the same period last year.

In order to ensure a bumper grain harvest this year in many ways, Party committees at all levels have taken advantage of the victory to expand the plan for expanding the planting of late autumn crops from more than 6 million mu to more than 11 million mu. They have also established a fourth line of defense, making full use of Yunnan's favorable natural conditions to grow vegetables, melons, beans, potatoes, and miscellaneous grains on a large scale. While doing a good job in field management, they have tried every means to tap the potential of the land, and implemented expanded planting, intercropping, and relay cropping. At present, the province has planted more than 1.1 million mu of vegetables, in addition to more than 1.3 million mu of intercropping and relay cropping, and more than 600 million nests of melons, beans, and vegetables have been planted on scattered plots of land.

The biggest feature of this year's summer planting work in Yunnan is that the broad masses of cadres and people, with a single burst of energy, and based on the guiding ideology of "two resolutions and three lines of defense," have combined soaring revolutionary vigor with the objective laws of agricultural production and the natural characteristics of Yunnan in a down-to-earth manner. When formulating plans, they have fully considered various possible natural disasters and unfavorable factors; in production arrangements, they have adopted multiple lines of defense and multiple guarantee measures. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses has been fully utilized, and the losses caused by the drought, which lasted for more than seven months, have been minimized as much as possible.

At the beginning of spring plowing, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee foresaw the development trend of this year's drought. Based on the experience of agricultural production and drought resistance struggle over the past ten years, it analyzed the natural characteristics of Yunnan Province and the objective laws of crop growth, and made full estimates of the various natural disasters that may be encountered this year, unfavorable factors in production, and other difficulties, and made good ideological, material, and organizational preparations to overcome various difficulties, so as to be prepared for any eventuality and leave room for maneuver. This enables agricultural production to stand invincible in the face of any difficulties. Under the guidance of this thought, the province formulated a strategic deployment of "one burst of energy, two resolutions, and three lines of defense" to overcome drought and win a bumper harvest. The "two resolutions" are to resolutely implement the principle of combining high yield and multiple harvests with multiple plantings, and the three lines of defense are: (1) First, make full use of the favorable conditions of high temperature brought about by the severe drought, seize the most favorable season, and plant 20 million mu of basic farmland with irrigation according to advanced standards to ensure a large area of high yield, striving for one mu to top two mu. (2) As soon as rainwater falls, rush to plant 20 million mu of general farmland; if there is still a shortage of rain at a certain season, plant drought-resistant crops in time to ensure multiple plantings and multiple harvests. (3) Make use of Yunnan's favorable climate conditions and vast land area to grow late autumn crops on a large scale. This deployment is a deployment full of the idea of striving for advancement, despising difficulties strategically, while being down-to-earth; and not neglecting any difficulties tactically.

Because this guiding ideology contains the personal experience of the broad masses of cadres and people in production practice for many years, it quickly became the thoughts of the cadres and millions of people of all ethnic groups. They cheered that this deployment was "a good move with decisive significance" for winning a bumper harvest. (Attached picture)

    切实总结经验　掌握客观规律　夺得生产抗灾主动权
    云南设下“三道防线”抗旱保粮
    种好两千万亩基本农田确保高产多收  抢种两千万亩一般农田力争多种多收  扩大种植晚秋作物作为重要后备
    本报昆明8日电　云南省各族人民积极贯彻云南省委的树立“三道防线”、在干旱情况下争取丰收的战略思想，战胜了长达七个多月的严重干旱，胜利结束中稻栽插，包谷的播种计划也超额一百九十多万亩提前完成。各族社员在栽种胜利的基础上，又掀起了以薅锄为中心的超包产田间管理的高潮。
    目前，连续七个多月的严重旱象已经解除。整个云南高原从南到北，一片油绿。抗旱栽种的大春粮食作物，已达三千五百多万亩。作为今年粮食生产骨干的第一道防线，即两千万亩大面积高产基本农田，已经按计划在最有利的节令里全部种下去。深翻、晒垡子、密植和施肥等技术措施，都按照比较先进的规格，保证了栽种质量。这些对大秋生产起着决定性作用的基本农田栽种的胜利完成，给全省各族社员们带来了很大的鼓舞，各地接着又乘胜迅速转入了第二道防线（二千万亩一般农田）和第三道防线（晚秋作物）的抢种工作，使整个三道防线的栽种计划步步主动。早在6月底，全省一至三道防线的栽种计划，就已经完成了96％。今年还进一步打破了往年栽完再管的老规律，实行边栽边管。到栽种基本完成时，全省已有二百万劳动力转入基本农田的薅锄工作。现在，薅锄完二道的稻谷和包谷，已达二千多万亩，薅锄的进度和质量比去年同期好。
    为了从多方面保证今年粮食丰收，各级党委又乘胜把第三道防线扩种晚秋作物六百多万亩的计划，扩大为一千一百多万亩。并纷纷建立了第四道防线，充分利用云南有利的自然条件大种蔬菜、瓜豆、薯类和杂粮。在搞好田间管理的同时，千方百计地挖掘土地潜力，实行扩种、间作和套种。现在，全省已种下蔬菜一百一十多万亩，另外间种、套种一百三十多万亩，利用零星土地种下六亿多窝瓜豆和蔬菜。
    云南今年的夏种工作的最大特点，是广大干部群众一股劲头，依据“两个坚决，三道防线”的指导思想，把冲天革命干劲，与实事求是地掌握农业生产的客观规律和云南的自然特点结合起来，在制订计划时充分考虑到可能发生的各种自然灾害和不利因素；在生产安排中采取了多道防线和多种保证措施。因而充分发挥了群众的积极性，把长达七个多月的干旱所造成的损失，尽可能缩小到最小的限度。
    春耕一开始，中共云南省委就预见到今年干旱的发展趋势。便依据十年来农业生产与抗旱斗争的经验，分析了云南省的自然特点和农作物生长的客观规律，把今年可能遇到的各种自然灾害，生产上的不利因素等等困难，作出充分的估计，作好战胜各种困难的思想准备、物质准备和组织准备，做到有备无患，留有余地。使农业生产在任何困难面前，都能立于不败之地。在这一思想指导下，全省制定了战胜干旱夺取丰收的“一股劲头，两个坚决，三道防线”的战略部署。“两个坚决”，即坚决贯彻高产多收与多种多收相结合的方针，三道防线，即：（1）首先充分利用严重干旱带来的气温高的有利条件，抓住最有利的节令，按照先进规格种好有水灌溉的两千万亩基本农田，确保大面积高产，力争一亩顶二亩。（2）雨水落地，立即抢种两千万亩一般农田；如果到了一定季节仍然缺雨，就及时种上耐旱作物保证多种多收。（3）利用云南气候条件好，土地面积辽阔的有利条件，大种晚秋作物。这个部署，是一个充满着力争上游的思想，在战略上蔑视困难，而又踏踏实实；在战术上不忽视任何困难的部署。
    由于这一指导思想包含了广大干部、群众多年来生产实践的切身体验，因而很快就变成了各族干部和千百万群众自己的思想。他们欢呼这一部署是对夺取丰收“具有决定意义的一着好棋”。（附图片）
