The Japanese People Are Advancing by Leaps and Bounds
Wu Xuewen

This time, accompanying the Chinese delegation to Tokyo to participate in the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament, marks my fifth visit to Japan since the autumn of 1954. The most prominent and profound impression left by this visit is that, after more than a year of mass movements against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, the Japanese people's struggle has taken on a momentum like surging wind and roaring waves, and the Japanese people are advancing by leaps and bounds.

In the days before the Chinese delegation arrived in Tokyo at the end of July, progressive parties and people's organizations in Japan were summing up the twenty-two nationwide unified actions that had been carried out. From the people's summary of the experiences and lessons of past movements, I deeply felt the great changes in Japan.

The Japanese working class, standing at the forefront of the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, has rapidly improved its political awareness after a year of vigorous struggle. Representatives of trade unions affiliated with the Tokyo Local Council of Trade Unions focused on discussing the goals and driving forces of the struggle at the summary meeting. A representative of the National Railway Workers' Union said that through the struggle against Eisenhower's visit to Japan, we realized that the main enemies of the Japanese people are U.S. imperialism, Nobusuke Kishi, and the traitorous Japanese monopoly capital groups; it is very important to make the masses recognize their main enemies in the struggle. A representative of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Employees' Union pointed out that the basic forces driving the struggle forward are the establishment of the National Council to Prevent Revision of the "Security Treaty," the cooperation between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, the joint struggle of trade unions, and the unity of broad national forces. Some trade union representatives also summarized the significance of the political general strike, believing that the working class, taking advantage of the favorable objective situation, resolutely launched a powerful struggle against the "Security Treaty" and won widespread support from public opinion; this is the basic force driving the nationwide unified action.

The Joint Struggle Conference Against the "Security Treaty" in Tokyo, an important fortress in the anti-U.S. patriotic united front, focused on summarizing the important significance of the united front. The meeting concluded that the joint action taken by the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party in the anti-U.S. patriotic just struggle over the past year is the basic force driving the development of the movement, and the working class force centered on the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) has played the greatest role in the struggle. However, without the joint action of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, the role of the working class could not have been fully exerted.

Japanese cultural figures centered on Kenzo Nakajima repeatedly discussed how to further recognize the main enemies of the Japanese people. Their conclusion pointed out that, judging from the relationship between preventing Eisenhower's visit to Japan and finally forcing Nobusuke Kishi to step down, U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionaries are undoubtedly the main enemies of the Japanese people, and they are like the two sides of a piece of paper, inseparable. The Tokyo Marxist Research Society pointed out at the summary meeting that in the past one or two years, the front of imperialism has been continuously weakened, and U.S. imperialism is supporting Japan and West Germany precisely to make up for its weaknesses and strengthen its two strongholds in the East and the West. Under the current international situation, the task of the Japanese people is to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and oppose the U.S. war policy.

What is exciting is that after correctly summarizing the achievements of the twenty-two nationwide unified actions, the Japanese people immediately launched a new struggle. They combined the movement against the U.S.-Japan military alliance with the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament. At the World Conference, I personally saw Japanese friends bring their understanding that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy, and their valuable experience of uniting broad forces to wage a resolute struggle against the enemy to the conference. This naturally received the support and admiration of representatives from various countries and encouraged the national independence movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism; it fully demonstrated the international significance of Japan's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle and pushed the peace movement forward. The Japanese people also used their understanding and experience gained from the struggle to completely thwart the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Yugoslavian representatives to separate this World Conference from the movement against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, and only talk about disarmament and create illusions of peace. It should be said that this is another victory with international significance achieved by the Japanese people after a series of victories such as preventing Eisenhower's visit to Japan, forcing Nobusuke Kishi to step down, and opposing the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Currently, such a movement to summarize work and implement the resolutions of the World Conference is being carried out universally throughout Japan, in various factories, rural areas, and schools. From these summaries and the tremendous role played by the Japanese people at the World Conference, it can be seen that the Japanese people have recognized the enemy, found ways to fight the enemy, strengthened their confidence, and are full of hope for the future.

The Japanese people's great strides forward can also be seen from the changes in farmers and other strata of the people.

I heard that a rural woman in Saitama Prefecture launched a signature campaign against the new "Security Treaty" in a village that had never been exposed to progressive movements. At the beginning, the farmers, who never read newspapers or listened to the radio, knew nothing about the "Security Treaty," and she was simply helpless. After some publicity and explanation, her old friend signed first. Soon, her friend's friend signed second on the signature book. In this way, the signature campaign in this village slowly unfolded, and eventually, more than 200 households in the entire village signed to express their opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance. When the ten-thousand-kilometer peace march passed through this village, people from the entire village participated in the march and held a gathering to welcome the passing marchers. Today, such examples are becoming increasingly common in Japanese rural areas. Recently, recognizing the great importance of the peasant movement to the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, many university students and professors have used their summer vacations to go to the countryside to carry out propaganda work. The attitude of Japanese farmers towards students and professors is also different from the past. In the past, farmers always said, "Those people only like to talk about politics"; today, farmers feel close to those who come to the countryside to do propaganda work, always greeting them with words of encouragement and then discussing national affairs together.

Farmers are beginning to take action. This time, 700 farmer and fisherman representatives participated in the World Conference. Through their personal experience in participating in the peace march and the World Conference, they strengthened their fighting spirit against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, against U.S. military bases, and against the revival of militarism. These representatives will certainly play a backbone role in the future peasant movement.

Japanese housewives are also advancing. In the anti-U.S. patriotic just struggle, many housewives have taken action and have been tempered. For example, in a residential area of 1,000 households in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo, "Security Treaty" discussion groups for housewives have emerged, often discussing the threat of the "Security Treaty" to the safety of Japan and Asia. Attracted by the workers, students, and professors who went to the Diet to demonstrate, they also formed a marching team of fifty or sixty people to join the citizens' groups led by the Japanese Communist Party. The mother of a high school student was initially very dissatisfied that her son participated in the youth organization led by the Japanese Communist Party and participated in the struggle against the "Security Treaty," returning home in the middle of the night every day. Because she was worried about her son's safety, one day she personally ran to the front of the Diet to see her son participating in the demonstration, and was completely moved by the scene of the mass struggle. After that, not only did she not oppose her son's participation in the struggle against the "Security Treaty," but she also gave him 300 yen of pocket money every day for him to buy food and eat with his marching partners.

The powerful anti-U.S. patriotic movement and the changes it has produced have also affected the internal affairs of the Japanese bourgeoisie.

In the past, we knew that the National Federation of Commerce and Industry Associations, with 80,000 small business owners participating, was an organization with progressive tendencies, and it held a market strike in the "June 4th" and "June 15th" general strikes to express its opposition to the new "Security Treaty." This visit to Japan made me realize that there are many more small and medium-sized business owners who express their opposition to this traitorous treaty in various ways, including some small and medium-sized business owners who originally belonged to Japanese monopoly capital. In order to counter the anti-U.S. movement of the masses, the Nobusuke Kishi group once planned to mobilize certain small and medium-sized enterprise groups to organize one million people to welcome Eisenhower's visit to Japan. However, these groups did not obey this time, because, judging from the emotions of the members, it was difficult to force mobilization. In the end, it was only decided that members would participate voluntarily. The slogans and small flags welcoming Eisenhower that the Liberal Democratic Party gave them are still piled up in the warehouse.

Japanese friends told me many things about small and medium-sized enterprises: the "Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Roundtable on Security Treaty Issues," consisting of 60 people, has been attending lectures hosted by famous scholars such as Mr. Kenzo Nakajima, exposing the aggressive nature of the "Security Treaty"; and the "Voice of Small and Medium-Sized Entrepreneurs" organization has been established, expressing opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance. The owner of a sweater factory with 60 workers donated 100,000 yen anonymously to the "Security Treaty Criticism Society" to support the activities of this progressive organization. A capitalist who owns a machine manufacturing plant with 700 workers often goes to the front of the Diet to support the marching teams in the struggle against the "Security Treaty," and provides assistance to progressive parties and groups. He said that the mass struggle moved him, and he felt that he should do what he could. A capitalist who owns a machine manufacturing plant participated in several demonstrations in front of the Diet, and after returning to the factory, he himself became a lecturer on the discussion meeting on opposing the "Security Treaty." This capitalist had served in China as a soldier during the war of aggression against China launched by Japanese imperialism, and was captured by the Chinese army before Japan's surrender on "August 15th." When he talked about this history, he said that a Chinese youth had told him: "In the future, our common enemy is U.S. imperialism, and Japan and China must fight together." At that time, he could not fully understand this sentence. But after the struggle against the "Security Treaty," he fully understood it. This capitalist also said that in the past he had also participated in the struggle against heavy taxes, but once the matter was over, everyone would have a drink and it would be over; the struggle against the "Security Treaty" was different, after everyone participated in the demonstration, they always talked about it, making people feel that there were changes in society.

A leader of the Japan Small and Medium Enterprises Friendly Association believes that these things show the weakening of the government and the prestige of the Liberal Democratic Party, and even the conservative groups that originally belonged to their sphere of influence do not act according to their will.

Japanese friends told me: Facing such an unprecedented change, the U.S.-Japanese ruling groups are trying to use both hard and soft tactics to suppress the vigorous struggle of the Japanese people. However, the summary of the twenty-two nationwide unified actions by progressive Japanese parties and groups, the victorious struggle of the Japanese people at the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament, and the awakening of the broad Japanese people have shown that the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese ruling groups is difficult to succeed. Japan's patriotic movement has taken firm root, and the fundamental reasons that promote its consolidation and development are the U.S.-Japan military alliance, U.S. military bases, and the Japanese government's implementation of U.S. war policies. As long as these objective reasons are still in front of the Japanese people, the contradictions between the Japanese people and U.S. imperialism cannot be resolved, and Japan's patriotic movement will inevitably continue to develop to a higher stage, until Japan is built into an independent, peaceful, democratic, and neutral country.

    日本人民正在大踏步前进
    吴学文
    这次随中国代表团到东京参加第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会，是我从1954年秋天以来第五次访问日本。这次访日留下的最突出、最强烈的印象就是：经过一年多的反对日美军事同盟的群众运动，日本人民的斗争已经形成风起云涌、波浪涛天之势，日本人民正在大踏步前进。
    在中国代表团7月底到达东京的前几天，日本的进步党派和人民团体正在就进行了二十二次的全国统一行动进行总结。我从人们对于过去运动的经验和教训的总结当中，深深地感到日本的伟大的变化。
    站在反对日美军事同盟斗争最前列的日本工人阶级，经过坚持一年的热火朝天的斗争，政治觉悟迅速提高了。东京地方工会评议会所属工会代表，在总结会上着重讨论了斗争的目标和斗争的动力问题。国营铁道工会代表说，通过反对艾森豪威尔访日的斗争，我们认识到日本人民的主要敌人是美帝国主义、岸信介和
  日本卖国的垄断资本集团；在斗争中使群众认清自己的主要敌人这一点是很重要的。东京都职员工会代表指出，推动斗争的基本力量是阻止修改“安全条约”国民会议的成立、社会党和共产党的合作、工会的共同斗争以及广泛的国民力量的团结。一些工会代表还总结了政治大罢工的意义，认为工人阶级利用有利的客观形势，决然展开反对“安全条约”的有力斗争，博得了舆论的广泛支持；这是推动全国统一行动的基本力量。
    作为反美爱国统一战线中一个重要堡垒的东京都反对“安全条约”共同斗争会议，着重总结了统一战线的重要意义。会上得出了这样的结论：一年来日本共产党和社会党在反美爱国正义斗争中采取联合行动，是推动运动发展的基本力量，而以日本工会总评议会为中心的工人阶级力量，在斗争中起了最大的作用。但如果没有共产党和社会党的联合行动，工人阶级的作用是不可能充分发挥的。
    以中岛健藏为中心的日本文化界人士反复讨论了如何进一步认清日本人民的主要敌人的问题。他们的结论指出，从阻止艾森豪威尔访日和终于迫使岸信介下台的事件关系来看，美帝国主义和日本反动派无疑是日本人民的主要敌人，它们就像一张纸的表里关系，无法分开。东京的唯物论研究会在总结会上指出，近一两年来，帝国主义的战线不断被削弱，美帝国主义扶植日本和西德正是为了弥补它的弱点，加强它在东西方的两个据点。在目前国际形势下，日本人民的任务是反对日本军国主义复活，反对美国的战争政策。
    令人兴奋的是，日本人民在正确地总结了二十二次全国统一行动的成就之后，立刻掀起新的斗争。他们把反对日美军事同盟运动和第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会结合起来。在世界大会上，我亲眼看到日本朋友把他们对于美帝国主义是最凶恶的敌人的认识、把他们团结广泛力量同敌人进行坚决斗争等宝贵经验带到大会上来。这很自然地受到各国代表的支持和敬佩，鼓舞了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义的民族独立运动；充分说明日本的反美爱国斗争所具有的国际意义，把和平运动向前推动了一步。日本人民还以自己从斗争中得来的认识和体会，彻底挫败了美日反动派和南斯拉夫代表企图使这次世界大会同反对日美军事同盟运动分割开来，只是空谈裁军和制造和平幻想的阴谋。应当说，这是日本人民继阻止艾森豪威尔访日、迫使岸信介下台、反对新日美“安全条约”等一系列的胜利之后，取得的又一次富有国际意义的胜利。
    目前，这样一个总结工作和贯彻世界大会决议的运动，正在日本全国各地、各工场、农村、学校普遍进行着。从这些总结和日本人民在世界大会上所发挥的巨大作用可以看出，日本人民已经认清了敌人、找到了同敌人进行斗争的办法、坚定了信心、对前途充满着希望。
    日本人民的大踏步前进，还可以从农民及其他阶层人民的变化中看出来。
    我听说，琦玉县的一位农村妇女，在一个从来没有接触过进步运动的村庄里展开了反对新“安全条约”的签名运动。开始，一向不看报纸也不听广播的农民对“安全条约”一无所知，她简直毫无办法，经过一番宣传解释，她的老朋友第一个签了名。不久，她的朋友的朋友又在签名簿上第二个签了名。就这样，这个村的签名运动慢慢展开了，一直发展到全村二百多户的人都签名表示反对日美军事同盟。当一万公里和平大游行的队伍经过这个村庄时，整个村子的人都参加了游行，并且集会欢迎过路的游行大军。今天在日本农村，这样的事例已经越来越普遍。最近，由于认识到农民运动对反对日美军事同盟的斗争关系重大，许多大学生和教授纷纷利用暑假到农村去进行宣传工作。日本农民对学生和教授的态度也跟过去不同了。过去，农民总是说“那些人专门爱谈政治”；今天，农民却对那些下乡来作宣传工作的人感到亲切，见面总是先道声辛苦，然后一道谈论国家大事。
    农民在开始行动起来。这次世界大会，就有七百名农民渔民代表参加。他们通过参加和平大游行和世界大会的亲身经历，坚定了反对日美军事同盟、反对美国军事基地、反对复活军国主义的斗志。这些代表肯定将在今后的农民运动中起骨干作用。
    日本的家庭妇女也在前进。在反美爱国正义斗争中，许多家庭妇女行动起来，受到了锻炼。例如，在东京世田谷区的一个一千户的住宅区里，出现了家庭妇女“安全条约”座谈小组，经常讨论“安全条约”对日本和亚洲安全的威胁问题。她们受到工人、学生、教授到国会去示威游行的吸引，也组成了五、六十名的游行队伍加入日本共产党所领导的市民团体的行列。一位高中学生的母亲，一开始对儿子参加日共领导的青年组织、参加反对“安全条约”的斗争每天搞到半夜三更回家这一点很不满意。因为担心儿子的安全，有一天她亲自跑到国会前面去探望儿子参加游行示威的情形，结果完全被群众斗争的场面感动了。这以后，她不仅不反对儿子参加反对“安全条约”的斗争，而且每天给他三百日元零用钱，让儿子买吃的和游行的伙伴一块吃。
    声势浩大的反美爱国运动和由此而产生的变化，也影响到了日本资产阶级的内部。
    过去我们知道，有着八万小企业主参加的全国商工团体联合会，是个有进步倾向的组织，它在“六·四”和“六·一五”总罢工中举行了罢市，表示反对新“安全条约”。这次访日使我了解到，以各种方式表示反对这项卖国条约的中小企业主，还大有人在，其中包括原来隶属于日本垄断资本的一部分中小企业主。岸信介集团为了和群众的反美运动对抗，曾经计划动员某些中小企业团体组织一百万人欢迎艾森豪威尔访日。但是这些团体这次没有唯命是从，理由是：从所属会员群众的情绪看来，很难强制动员。最后只决定了会员个人自愿参加的原则。自由民主党发给他们的欢迎艾森豪威尔的标语和小旗，直到现在还被积压在仓库里。
    日本朋友告诉我许多有关中小企业这方面的情况：由六十人组成的“安全条约问题中小企业恳谈会”一直出席中岛健藏先生等著名学者主持的关于揭露“安全条约”侵略本质的演讲会；并且成立了“中小企业家之声”组织，表示反对日美军事同盟。一家有六十名工人的线衣工厂的企业主，用匿名捐款十万日元给
  “安全条约批判会”，支援这个进步组织的活动。一个拥有七百名工人的机器制造厂的资本家，在反对“安全条约”斗争中常常到国会前面去声援游行队伍，并且给进步党派和团体以资助。他说群众斗争使他受到感动，他认为自己应当尽其所能作些事情。一个机器制造厂的资本家参加了几次国会前的游行示威后，回到厂里自己担任起有关反对“安全条约”讨论会的讲师来。这位资本家在日本帝国主义发动的侵华战争中曾经到中国当过兵，“八·一五”日本投降前被中国军队俘掳。他谈到这段历史的时候说，有一位中国青年对他讲过：“今后我们的共同敌人是美帝国主义，日本和中国要一起来进行斗争。”当时他还不能十分理解这一句话。但是经过反对“安全条约”的斗争，他完全理解了。这位资本家还说，过去他也参加过反对重税的斗争，但事情一过，大家喝上一杯酒就完事了；反对“安全条约”的斗争却不同，大家参加游行示威以后，总是谈论着这件事，使人感到社会上起了变化。
    日本中小企业同友会一位领导人认为，这些事情表明政府和自由民主党的威信的削弱，原来属于它们势力范围内的保守团体，也不按照它们的意志行动了。
    日本朋友告诉我：面对着这样一个空前的变化，美日统治集团正企图使用软硬兼施的手法把蓬蓬勃勃的日本人民的斗争压下去。但是，日本进步党派和团体对二十二次全国统一行动的总结、日本人民在第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会上进行的胜利斗争、广大的日本人民的觉醒，已经表明美日统治集团的阴谋是难以得逞的。日本的爱国运动已经牢牢地生了根，促使它巩固发展的根本原因是日美军事同盟、美国军事基地和日本政府执行美国战争政策。只要这些客观原因还摆在日本人民的面前，日本人民同美帝国主义之间的矛盾就不能解决，日本的爱国运动就必然继续向更高的阶段发展，直到把日本建成一个独立、和平、民主、中立的国家。
