Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 6th: Albania, in order to accelerate basic construction this year, has put a newly built brick and tile factory in Elbasan into production. Three brick and tile factories under construction in Shkodër, Lushnjë, and Vlorë are nearing completion.

Currently, there are one hundred and fifty important construction projects underway throughout Albania. Many projects will be put into production this year as gifts to the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, which will be held in November.

Projects recently put into production include a cigarette factory in Shkodër and a cannery in Berat. The commissioning of these factories will increase Albania's export capacity.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 7th: In the first six months of this year, Poland produced a total of 11,700 metal cutting machine tools; before liberation, it could only produce 3,000 machine tools annually.

Before liberation, although the machine tool manufacturing industry was one of the more developed industrial sectors in Poland, it could only produce a few of the simplest metal cutting machine tools and woodworking machine tools.

Now, People's Poland can produce about 350 kinds of metal cutting machine tools and woodworking machine tools. This year, Poland has begun to produce complete sets of 33 new types of machine tools. At the same time, Polish machine tool manufacturing is increasing the production of automatic machine tools and heavy-duty universal machine tools.

Polish machine tools are a major export item for the machinery manufacturing industry and are generally well-received abroad. Currently, Poland exports more than 130 types of machine tools to more than 50 countries. In recent years, it has exported approximately 60 new types of metal processing machine tools, woodworking machine tools, and plastic processing machine tools. In the next five-year plan (1961-1965), the production of machine tool industry export products will approximately triple.

In recent years, the Polish machine tool industry has undergone tremendous technological innovation. Machine tool factory workers are working hard to maximize the automation of machine tools.

In the next five-year plan, the state will invest heavily in the machine tool industry, with new machine tool factories being built in various locations and existing factories being renovated. Since liberation, investment in the machine tool manufacturing industry has been approximately 700 million złoty, and during the period from 1961 to 1965, this investment will increase to 800 million złoty. By the end of 1965, Poland will produce approximately 200 new types of machine tools, at which time the annual output of machine tools will reach 30,000 units.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, August 5th: Mongolia's state-owned farm and ranch machinery stations are currently vigorously overhauling agricultural machinery and actively preparing for the autumn harvest.

This year, the national sowing area in Mongolia reached 252,400 hectares, an increase of more than 89,000 hectares compared to last year. The climate has been good this year, with timely rainfall, and the grain is growing well. A bumper harvest is expected, and the harvesting work will also be quite heavy.

Currently, the state-owned farms and ranches are actively making various preparations and have made specific arrangements for the labor force and various machines participating in the autumn harvest. The state-owned farms and ranches alone will have more than 800 combine harvesters, more than 300 harvesters, more than 200 tractors, more than 1,200 trucks, and many other agricultural machines involved in the harvesting work.

In order to successfully complete the autumn harvest, the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Council of Ministers recently instructed relevant departments to make various preparations. The Mongolian State-Owned Farm and Ranch Management Bureau has also mobilized more than 7,000 students from the capital and more than 1,000 vehicles to support the autumn harvest work.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 6th: Romania's petroleum, chemical, and natural gas industries have achieved great success in this year's socialist competition and technological innovation movement. In the first half of this year, these three important industrial sectors overfulfilled the total output value plan by 2.5%. The labor productivity plan was also overfulfilled.

Due to the significant achievements in reducing costs in the first five months of the competition, the workers have raised the annual savings target proposed at the beginning of the year from 180 million lei (Romanian currency) to 252.2 million lei. The total savings of these three industrial sectors last year was more than 122.2 million lei.

In the technological innovation movement, workers in these three departments put forward nearly 2,800 innovation proposals in the first half of this year, and it is estimated that the implementation of these proposals can save more than 58.8 million lei, 24% more than in the second half of last year.

This year, the advanced turbine drilling method has been vigorously promoted in oil drilling and exploitation. By June, about 40% of the national drilling workload was completed using this method. This method is one to two times faster than ordinary rotary drilling, and it can also greatly reduce drilling costs.

    阿尔巴尼亚加速本年度基本建设
    波兰机床工业发展迅速  蒙古积极准备迎接秋收
    罗马尼亚石油化学等部门超额完成上半年计划
    新华社地拉那6日电　阿尔巴尼亚为了加速本年度基本建设，已将一座在爱尔巴桑新建的砖瓦厂投入生产。在斯库台、卢什涅和发罗那兴建的三座砖瓦厂即将完工。
    目前阿尔巴尼亚全国有一百五十项重要建设项目在兴建中。许多项目将在今年投入生产，作为向11月召开的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第四次代表大会的献礼。
    最近投入生产的项目有斯库台的卷烟厂和培拉特的罐头厂。这些工厂的投入生产将增加阿尔巴尼亚的出口能力。
    新华社华沙7日电　今年头六个月中，波兰总共生产了一万一千七百台金属切削机床；而解放以前每年只能生产三千台机床。
    解放以前，机床制造工业虽然是波兰比较发达的工业部门之一，但是只能生产几种最简单的金属切削机床和木材加工机床。
    现在，人民波兰能生产大约三百五十种金属切削机床和木材加工机床。今年波兰已经开始成套地生产三十三种新型机床。同时，波兰机床制造业正在增加自动机床和重型万能机床等的生产。
    波兰的机床是机器制造业的主要出口项目，在国外受到普遍的欢迎。目前，波兰向五十多个国家输出一百三十多种机床。最近几年，它大约出口了六十多种新型的金属加工机床、木材加工机床和塑料加工机床。在下一个五年计划（1961—1965年）中，机床工业出口产品的生产将大约增加三倍。
    近几年来，波兰机床工业进行了巨大的技术革新。机床工厂的工作人员正在努力使机床最大限度地自动化。
    在下一个五年计划中，国家将对机床工业进行大量投资，各地将兴建新的机床制造厂，并改建现有的工厂。解放以来，对机床制造工业的投资约为七亿兹罗提，而在1961—1965年期间，这一投资就将增加到八亿兹罗提，到1965年年底，波兰将生产大约二百种新型机床，那时，机床的年产量将达三万台。
    新华社乌兰巴托5日电　蒙古各国营农牧场机器站最近正在大力检修农业机器，积极迎接秋收。
    蒙古今年全国播种面积达二十五万二千四百公顷，比去年增加八万九千多公顷。今年气候良好、雨水调和，谷物生长很好，丰收在望，收获工作也将相当繁重。
    目前各国营农牧场正积极作好各项准备工作，并对参加秋收的劳动力和各种机器作了具体安排。仅国营农牧场就将有八百多台收获联合机、三百多台收割机、二百多台拖拉机、一千二百多辆载重汽车和很多其他农业机器投入收获工作。
    为了胜利完成秋收工作，最近，蒙古人民革命党中央委员会和部长会议责成有关部门作好各项准备工作。蒙古国营农牧场管理处也动员七千多名首都学生和一千多辆汽车支援秋收工作。
    新华社布加勒斯特6日电　罗马尼亚石油、化学、天然气工业在今年社会主义竞赛和技术革新运动中取得巨大成绩。今年上半年这三个重要工业部门超额2.5％完成了总产值计划。劳动生产率计划也超额完成了。
    由于在头五个月的竞赛中在降低成本方面取得了显著成就，所以工人们已将年初提出的全年节约一亿八千万列伊（罗币）的指标提高到二亿五千二百万列伊。这三个工业部门去年全年节约的数字是一亿二千二百多万列伊。
    在技术革新运动中，这三个部门的工人今年上半年共提出了近两千八百项革新建议，预计实施这些建议可以节约五千八百多万列伊，比去年下半年多24％。
    今年，在石油钻探和开采方面大力推行了先进的涡轮钻井法。到6月份为止，全国40％左右的钻进工作量都是靠这种方法完成的。这种方法比普通的旋转钻井法的钻进速度快一至二倍，同时还可以大大降低钻井成本。
