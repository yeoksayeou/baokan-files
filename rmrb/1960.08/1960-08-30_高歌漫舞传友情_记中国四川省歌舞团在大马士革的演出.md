On the night of August 20th, on the brightly lit stage of the Damascus Fair Theater, the final jubilant scene of "People's Commune Celebrating a Good Harvest" appeared. As the red velvet curtain slowly closed, a burst of warm applause erupted from the silent audience. The audience waved, greeted, and cheered at the actors who were taking their bows on stage. In this atmosphere full of enthusiasm and friendship, the final performance of the Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe of China in Damascus came to an end.

The Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe of China, at the invitation of the Damascus Fair, performed continuously for five nights in Damascus. The troupe's programs, rich in everyday life and national style, fully demonstrated the Chinese people's infinitely joyful mood in the beautiful reality of their lives. At the same time, they also brought the friendship of the Chinese people to the distant Arab people. Most of the people who came to watch the performances were ordinary people. Among them were workers, farmers, women wearing veils, and old people in Arab national costumes. They were attracted by this art from friendly China. Although the song and dance troupe only performed five times, some people watched two, three, or even four performances in a row. One driver worker told us, "I have seen it three times already, but I still have to go to see this last performance tonight."

"Lion Dance" is a dance with a strong national character, and it was warmly welcomed by the audience. When the actors playing the lions vividly and meticulously expressed the various movements of the lions, the audience frequently exclaimed with admiration and pleasant laughter. They said that the four actors playing the two lions had "seamless cooperation" and "excellent coordination"! An old Arab artist couldn't help but sketch a drawing on the spot while watching the lion dance. There was also the healthy, bright, and lively "Umbrella Dance," the light and graceful Yi ethnic dance "Presenting the Cape to Chairman Mao," the "Harvest Dance" full of children's interest, and the "People's Commune Harvest Dance," which reflected the joyous and happy scenes of the people's commune, all deeply touched the hearts of the audience. They could only express their uncontrollable joy with cheers and applause.

It is particularly worth mentioning that the Chinese national instrumental ensemble strongly captivated the hearts of the audience. Whenever this program was performed on stage, all the audience in the audience listened and appreciated with rapt attention. When a piece ended, applause, cheers, and calls for "Encore!" rose one after another. At the last performance, "Eagles Spreading Their Wings" was warmly welcomed. It conveyed the Chinese people's jubilant mood in the Great Leap Forward and their lofty aspirations to strive for the upstream through the sound of wind and stringed instruments like high mountains and flowing water, conveying this to Arab friends. When the performance was over, the enthusiastic response from the audience was truly indescribable. Amidst the cries of "Encore!" the actors played another piece, "Dance of the Golden Snake."

The song "Long Live Mao Zedong" sung by the song and dance troupe's choir was also highly praised by the audience. While singing this song, a young man who had visited China in 1957 hummed the song he was once familiar with, and another audience member said softly in the audience, "Long Live Mao Zedong!"

In recent days, the visit of the Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe of China has received various friendly expressions from the Arab people. Many people from all over the United Arab Republic and Arab countries such as Lebanon and Jordan, whether in the Damascus Fair Theater and the Chinese Pavilion, or at receptions and on the streets, always greeted and smiled when they saw Chinese people. Some people also expressed their gratitude to the Chinese government for sending various song and dance acrobatic troupes to visit and perform in the Arab region in the past. Many viewers used "truly folk art" and "exquisite performances" to describe their feelings. A professor from Damascus said, "I never tire of watching Chinese songs and dances because I love the Chinese people." A famous sculptor from the Syrian region talked about the friendship between the Chinese and Arab peoples at a reception, saying humorously: "I don't know why we Arabs love the Chinese people so much. Maybe it's like the Arab saying, 'Seek knowledge, even if it is in China.'" His words were immediately followed by an artist from the Syrian region, saying, "Your China is an oriental power with 650 million people, the representative of Asia, and the cradle of ancient culture. You have had many common experiences with our Arab countries in the past, so we are naturally easy to get close to." The sculptor also gave a very precious and exquisite small wooden box from an Arab to Zhang Tiesheng, the head of the Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe of China, to express his friendship with the Chinese people.

The performance of the Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe in Damascus has come to a successful conclusion, but people believe that the charm of Chinese song and dance art and the friendship of the Chinese people that it has brought to the Arab people will forever remain in the hearts of the people.

    高歌漫舞传友情
    ——记中国四川省歌舞团在大马士革的演出
    新华社记者　程良平　林海
    8月20日的深夜，在大马士革博览会剧场灯光明亮的舞台上，出现了“人民公社庆丰收”的最后一个欢腾场面，红色的丝绒帷幕在徐徐闭上，肃静的观众席上爆发出一片热烈的掌声，观众们向舞台上正在谢幕的演员们挥手、致意、欢呼，就在这一片充满热情友好的气氛中，中国四川省歌舞团在大马士革的最后一场演出结束了。
    中国四川省歌舞团应大马士革博览会的邀请，在大马士革连续演出了五场。歌舞团所带来的富有浓厚生活气息和民族风格的节目，充分地表现了中国人民在美好的现实生活中无限欢乐的心情，同时，也把中国人民的友情带给了遥远的阿拉伯人民。前来观看演出的大多数是普通人民。他们之中有工人、农民，有戴着面纱的妇女，有穿着阿拉伯民族服装的老人。他们被这来自友好中国的艺术吸引住了。歌舞团虽然只演出五场，但还有些人连续看了二场、三场甚至四场。有一个司机工人告诉我们说，“我已经看过三次了，但今晚还得去看这最后的一场。”
    “狮舞”是一个富有浓厚的民族色彩的舞蹈，它受到了观众们热烈的欢迎，当扮演狮子的演员如此生动细致地表现出狮子的各种动作时，观众席上不时发出一片“啧，啧”的赞叹声和愉快的笑声。他们说那扮演两头狮子的四个演员真是“天衣无缝的合作”“良好的协调的配合”！一个阿拉伯老艺人在观看狮舞时，禁不住当场画出了一幅素描。还有健康、明快而活泼的“花伞舞”，轻盈、优美的彝族舞蹈“把披毡献给毛主席”，充满儿童情趣的“丰收舞”以及反映人民公社欢乐幸福情景的“人民公社丰收舞”等都深深地打动了观众们的心，他们只有用喝彩、用掌声来表达他们禁不住的喜悦。
    特别值得一提的是中国民族器乐合奏是如此强烈地扣住了观众们的心弦，每当舞台上演出这个节目时，台下所有的观众都是在全神贯注的倾听、欣赏。当一曲终了，掌声、叫好声、“再来一个”的呼声此起彼伏。在最后一场演出时，“群鹰展翅”受到了热烈欢迎，它把中国人民在大跃进中欢欣鼓舞的心情和力争上游的壮志通过那有如高山流水、一泻千里的管弦丝竹之音传达给了阿拉伯的朋友们。当演奏完了，观众席上的热烈反应真是难以描绘，在“再来一个”的喝采声中，演员们又演奏了一曲“金蛇狂舞”。
    歌舞团合唱队所唱的“万岁毛泽东”这支歌子，也很受观众赞扬，在演唱这支歌时，一个在1957年曾经访问过中国的青年在台下轻轻地哼起了这支他曾经熟悉的歌子，还有一个观众在台下轻轻地说着“毛泽东万岁！”。
    这些天来，中国四川省歌舞团在这里的访问得到了阿拉伯人民各种友好的表示，许多来自阿联各地以及黎巴嫩、约旦等阿拉伯国家的人民，不论是在大马士革博览会的剧场里和中国馆里，还是在招待会上和大街上，只要他们一见到中国人总是问好、微笑。有些人在言谈中还表示感激中国政府过去派出各种歌舞杂技团来阿拉伯地区进行访问演出。许多观众用“真正来自民间的艺术”“精湛的表演”来形容他们的感受。一位大马士革的教授说，我看中国歌舞百看不厌，因为我热爱中国人民。叙利亚地区的一位著名的雕刻家在一次招待会上谈到中国和阿拉伯人民的友谊，富有风趣地说：我也不知道我们阿拉伯人为什么这样地热爱中国人民，这也许是像阿拉伯格言中所说的那样，“寻求知识，即使远在中国”。他的话立即为一位叙利亚地区的艺术家接上去说，你们中国是六亿五千万人民的东方大国，亚洲的代表，古代文化的摇篮，你们过去同我们阿拉伯国家有许多共同的遭遇，因此我们自然很容易接近。那位雕刻家当场还把一个阿拉伯人非常珍贵的精制小木盒送给中国四川省歌舞团的张铁生团长，表示他对中国人民的友谊。
    四川省歌舞团在大马士革的演出已经胜利结束了，但人们相信它给阿拉伯人民带来的中国歌舞艺术的魅力以及中国人民的友情是会永远留在人民心头的。（附图片）
