    Immediately Launch an Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement Centered on Grain and Steel

    Now it is mid-August, and the next four and a half months are the decisive moment to complete and overfulfill this year's national economic plan. The major task before the whole party and the entire people is: Under the guidance of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with more, faster, better, and more economical results, and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, to launch a vigorous nationwide increase production and practice economy movement centered on grain and steel, mobilize all forces that can be mobilized, and fully utilize all favorable factors to strive practically and in every possible way to complete and overfulfill this year's production plans for grain, steel, and other major products.

    The current political and economic situation in our country is very good, and work in all areas has unfolded into a vigorous mass movement, full of vitality. Industry, agriculture, transportation, and basic construction are all continuing to leap forward and have achieved great accomplishments. Industrial production in the first half of this year increased significantly compared to the same period last year. The output of steel, iron, and coal all increased by more than 50% compared to the same period last year, and all completed more than 40% of the annual plan. On the agricultural front, although after last year's severe natural disasters, this year again suffered severe droughts and floods in some areas, due to the arduous efforts of all farmers and support from all sides to agriculture, a huge victory in fighting drought and rush planting was achieved. The rural people's communes have embarked on the road of consolidation and sound development, increasingly showing their superiority. The urban people's commune movement is also developing steadily. The mass movement for technological innovation and technological revolution has achieved great results. Small-scale indigenous groups, especially small-scale modern groups, centered on increasing the production of raw materials, materials, and fuels, have seen new development. All of this further proves that the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, the people's communes, and a series of "walking on two legs" policies are completely correct and are increasingly showing their infinitely powerful vitality.

    The new achievements have further encouraged the people across the country. Everyone has more confidence and higher enthusiasm, and they have thrown themselves into the struggle to overcome various natural disasters and difficulties and complete the current production tasks with greater vigor. On the agricultural front, the broad masses of commune members are seizing the opportunity to drain water and fight drought, rush to plant autumn vegetables, rush to plant late autumn crops, and strengthen field management in an effort to obtain more harvests in the autumn. Mass movements to support agriculture have unfolded in all regions and all walks of life across the country. The broad masses of workers and staff on the industrial front are fighting high temperatures and the rainy season, focusing on coal, iron, mines, and transportation, and a new upsurge in the mass movement to strive for continued large-scale growth in steel production has emerged in many provinces and cities. All of this powerfully demonstrates that the conditions for further unleashing the enthusiasm and creativity of the people and striving to complete and overfulfill this year's national economic plan are very favorable.

    Of course, there are still some local shortcomings and temporary difficulties in our work, and there are still many problems in the comprehensive arrangement of production and construction and the people's lives that need to be earnestly grasped and resolved. Now, it is necessary to further organize the high labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, concentrate everyone's strength on the most important aspects, and overcome the shortcomings and difficulties in our work on the basis of the existing great achievements, and strive for even greater victories. Since the founding of the country, we have carried out many increase production and practice economy movements, and each movement has achieved great victories, proving that this is a successful experience in mobilizing the masses and developing production. We should fully utilize this experience and immediately launch a nationwide increase production and practice economy movement centered on grain and steel.

    Why should grain and steel be the center of the increase production and practice economy movement? As everyone knows, agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. Steel is the "grain" of industry, and also the main "grain" for agricultural mechanization and agricultural basic construction. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "With grain and steel, everything is easy to handle." The experience of the Great Leap Forward over the past two years has proven that grain and steel determine the development speed of the entire national economy. Our victories in the continuous two-year Great Leap Forward were achieved under the policy of taking grain as the key link in agriculture and steel as the key link in industry. If grain and steel develop rapidly, they can drive the high-speed advancement of all sectors of the national economy, and accelerate the building of our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Therefore, we must mobilize all forces and positive factors, first ensure the increase in grain and steel production, and practice economy in all aspects. This is the central link in developing the entire national economy.

    Increase production and practice economy is a nationwide mass movement. First of all, it is necessary to widely and deeply mobilize the masses to participate. All communes, enterprises, institutions, schools, and troops throughout the country, without exception, must mobilize the masses to check the production and economy situation in the first seven and a half months (those without production tasks should focus on checking the economy situation), discuss and formulate the increase production and practice economy plans for the next four and a half months and specific measures to achieve the plans. In rural areas, every commune, production brigade, production team, and production group should conduct discussions and make specific arrangements around autumn field management and autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and preparations for autumn and winter sowing. In industry, it is necessary to inform the workers of the specific plans assigned to each unit by the state, mobilize the workers in every factory, mine, workshop, blast furnace, converter, and other grassroots units to conduct discussions and formulate specific monthly, semi-monthly, and even daily targets for completing and overfulfilling the state plan, and measures to complete these targets. This discussion should include five aspects: output, quality, variety, cost reduction, and safe production. Every station, dock, locomotive, ship, and vehicle in the transportation sector, and every engineering company, construction site, and group in the basic construction sector should also discuss and formulate specific increase production and practice economy plans and guarantee measures around the main indicators of their respective departments. Institutions, schools, troops, and all other undertakings should mobilize the masses to focus on discussing economy and related production issues. In this way, through national discussion, the potential for increasing production and practicing economy can be tapped, feasible measures for increasing production and practicing economy can be found, and the enthusiasm of the people across the country for building socialism can be further mobilized, so that the completion and overfulfillment of various indicators of the national economy can be more reliably guaranteed.

    In order to ensure the implementation of the increase production and practice economy plan, it is necessary to widely carry out labor emulation campaigns for increasing production and practicing economy. Communes, production brigades, production teams, factories, mines, workshops, teams, stations, docks, locomotives, ships, and vehicles with roughly the same production conditions should organize competitions, conduct regular evaluations, exchange experiences, and promptly summarize, so that general and backward production units can quickly catch up with advanced units and raise the overall production level. In the competition, it is particularly important to seize the opportunity to continue to deepen the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution. In the past two or three years, especially since the first half of this year, the broad masses of workers, peasants, cadres, and technical personnel have made a large number of extremely valuable inventions. In this increase production and practice economy movement, under the leadership of the Party committee, the method of combining leading cadres with workers (commune members) and technical personnel should be adopted to further concentrate on sorting out, reviewing, and appraising, and those innovation projects that have a direct effect on solving the current key production problems, have the greatest effect, and are of universal significance should be summarized, improved, systematized, and quickly and widely promoted. In our country, the flowers of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement are in full bloom, and we should strive for even more abundant fruits so that they can fully play their role in production.

    In the increase production and practice economy movement, it is necessary to concentrate efforts to first ensure the increase in grain and steel production. It is necessary to concentrate the strength of the masses, the material resources, financial resources, and leadership energy on the current main tasks. First of all, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and strengthen the agricultural front, especially the grain production front. Every county and people's commune must immediately mobilize the masses and transfer as much labor as possible to invest in field production. Rural basic construction such as water conservancy must be subordinate to the needs of current agricultural production and be carried out in stages and batches on the premise of ensuring current grain production. In addition to a part that must maintain year-round production, county and commune industries and sideline businesses must generally be combined with the agricultural production season, doing more in slack seasons, less in busy seasons, stopping in very busy seasons, farming in busy seasons, and working in slack seasons. In order to strengthen agricultural production forces, all industrial departments must improve labor productivity through technological innovation and technological revolution, save manpower to meet the needs of new enterprises, and send part of the manpower saved to rural areas. In the industrial field, it is necessary to concentrate efforts to first ensure the increase in steel production. All enterprises and employees who undertake the task of transferring pig iron, coal, and ore to other places must strive to increase production and improve quality to fully ensure the needs of key steel enterprises. Employees in the machinery manufacturing sector must concentrate on using materials and technical forces to first ensure the completion of the production and matching of mining equipment, transportation machinery, agricultural machinery, fertilizer equipment, etc., as well as spare parts and accessories. Employees in the transportation sector must give priority to ensuring the transportation of materials needed for increasing grain and steel production. In this way, by first concentrating the necessary forces on the main tasks of increasing grain and steel production, we can make greater achievements in these areas, and make the leap forward of the entire national economy have a more solid foundation.

    In the increase production and practice economy movement, it is necessary to open up new sources of income on the one hand and reduce expenditures on the other. Through this movement, we must further promote the fine traditions and social atmosphere of national economy among all people. All factories, mines, communes, institutions, schools, and troops must strive to improve production efficiency and work efficiency, save living labor and save grain, cotton cloth, steel, and coal, cherish machines and tools, and save all savable materials. We must not only build the country diligently and frugally, run factories diligently and frugally, and run communes diligently and frugally, but also manage our households diligently and frugally and run all undertakings diligently and frugally. Through this movement, we must further foster a social atmosphere of taking hard work and simplicity as an honor and extravagance and waste as a shame among the people throughout the country. If we do a good job in economy, we can do more with the same manpower and materials, accelerate the speed of socialist construction, increase the country's material reserves, and enhance the country's economic strength. The people of our country have a glorious tradition of diligence and frugality. We believe that the people across the country will surely respond to the call of the Central Committee and further carry forward this glorious tradition.

    In order to smoothly unfold the increase production and practice economy movement, leading cadres at all levels must not only lead production well, but also arrange the lives of the masses well. First of all, we must pay attention to combining work and rest and properly arrange working and resting hours. At the same time, whether in rural or urban areas, we must do a good job in the meals of the masses. In rural areas, on the basis of doing a good job in grain production, we must manage and use grain well. The grain of rural people's communes should be collected and distributed in a unified manner by the basic accounting units, and managed in a unified manner to manage it comprehensively. It is necessary to actively run canteens, adhere to planned grain use, and save grain, not only to save, but also to eat well. Canteens must have their own vegetable plots, vigorously develop melons and vegetables, and vigorously develop non-staple foods. Party committees in cities should also strengthen their leadership over various catering units, give full play to their enthusiasm, and produce as many non-staple foods as possible without increasing personnel. In industrial enterprises, special attention should be paid to ensuring the nutrition of employees engaged in high-temperature, high-altitude, cold, underground operations, or other particularly heavy labor. Every commune and large factory, mine, institution, and school should have an administrative person in charge or a person in charge of the Party committee to manage life.

    In order to make this increase production and practice economy movement a success, to fully mobilize and organize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, and to quickly achieve practical results in production, the key lies in strengthening leadership. To this end, cadres of Party organizations and administrative leading organs at all levels must immediately take action, go to the front line of production, go deep into the communes, production teams, and fields, go to factories, mines, and workshops, go to stations and docks, eat, live, work, and discuss with the masses, directly participate in and lead production, and promptly help the grassroots solve key problems in production. Leading cadres of central business departments should go deep into some major crop, especially grain, key producing areas, go deep into key factories, mining enterprises, and units, and work with local Party committees and Party committees of various communes, factories, and mines to effectively solve specific problems. In short, we must not only do a good job in this movement and effectively achieve the practical results of increasing production and practicing economy, but also through this movement, improve the leadership style and working methods of cadres at all levels, make the relationship between leaders and the masses closer, thereby creating better conditions for continued leap forward in the future.

    Now it is mid-August, and there are only four and a half months left this year. Time is extremely valuable, and we must act immediately. In agriculture, we must do a good job in field management and strive for as much as possible in the autumn harvest; at the same time, we must do a good job in the preparation for autumn plowing and autumn sowing, and strive to plant more and plant well. In the industrial field, it must be ensured that the output of steel and other major industrial products will have a substantial increase in August and September, and make greater efforts in the fourth quarter to make production have a greater increase. The current situation is very favorable for us. We firmly believe that all Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, revolutionary cadres, all workers, farmers, and people of other strata will enthusiastically respond to the call of the Central Committee, unite as one, launch a vigorous and down-to-earth increase production and practice economy movement centered on grain and steel, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's national economic plan.

    立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动
    现在已经是8月半，今后四个半月是完成和超额完成今年国民经济计划的决定性时刻。摆在全党全民面前的重大任务是：在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针指导下，开展一个轰轰烈烈的以粮、钢为中心的全民增产节约运动，动员一切可以动员的力量，充分利用一切有利因素，踏踏实实地、千方百计地为完成和超额完成今年的粮、钢和其他主要产品的生产计划而奋斗。
    当前我国的政治经济形势很好，各个方面的工作都展开了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，充满着蓬蓬勃勃的朝气。工业、农业、交通运输和基本建设事业都在继续跃进、取得了伟大的成就。今年上半年的工业生产，比去年同期增长很多。钢、铁、煤的产量都比去年同期增长了50％以上，都完成了全年计划40％以上。在农业战线上，虽然在去年的特大灾害之后，今年又遭了严重的旱灾和部分地区的大水灾，但是由于全体农民的艰巨努力和各方面对农业的支援，仍然取得了抗旱抢种的巨大胜利。农村人民公社已经走上了巩固和健全发展的道路，日益显出它的优越性。城市人民公社化运动也正在稳步发展。技术革新和技术革命的群众运动获得了巨大的成绩。以增产原料、材料和燃料为中心的小土群、特别是小洋群企业有了新的发展。所有这些，都进一步证明了党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社和一系列“两条腿走路”的方针是完全正确的，并且越来越鲜明地显示出它们具有无限强大的生命力。
    新的成就进一步鼓舞了全国人民。大家的信心更足了，热情更高了，纷纷以更大的干劲投入了为战胜各种自然灾害和困难、完成当前生产任务的斗争。在农业战线上，广大社员正在抓紧时机，排涝抗旱，抢种秋菜，抢种晚秋作物，加强田间管理，力争秋季得到更多的收成。全国各地各行各业都展开了支援农业的群众运动。工业战线上的广大职工，正奋战高温雨季，狠抓煤、铁、矿、运，不少省市出现了争取钢铁生产继续大幅度增长的群众运动新高潮。这一切有力地表明，进一步发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性、力争完成和超额完成今年国民经济计划的条件是非常有利的。
    当然，在我们的工作中还存在一些局部的缺点和暂时的困难，在生产建设和人民生活的全面安排方面还有不少问题需要认真抓紧解决。现在必须把广大人民群众的高涨的劳动热情进一步组织起来，把大家的力量集中到最主要的方面去，在已有的伟大成就的基础上，克服工作中的缺点和困难，争取更大的胜利。建国以来，我们进行过多次的增产节约运动，每次运动都获得了巨大胜利，证明这是动员群众、发展生产的一个成功经验。我们应当充分运用这个经验，马上在全国展开一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动。
    为什么要以粮、钢为增产节约运动的中心呢？大家知道，农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础。钢是工业的“粮食”，也是农业机械化和农业基本建设的主要“粮食”。毛泽东同志说过，“一个粮食，一个钢铁，有了这两个东西就什么都好办了”。两年多来大跃进的经验证明，粮和钢决定着整个国民经济的发展速度，我们连续两年的大跃进的胜利，就是在农业以粮为纲、工业以钢为纲的方针下取得的。粮和钢发展得快，就能够带动国民经济各部门高速度地前进，就能够加速把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国。因此，我们必须调动一切力量和积极因素，首先保证粮和钢的增产，并且从各方面厉行节约。这是发展整个国民经济的中心环节。
    增产节约是一个全民性的群众运动。首先要广泛地深入地发动群众参加。全国一切公社、企业、机关、学校、部队，无一例外地都要发动群众检查前七个半月的生产和节约情况（没有生产任务的，着重检查节约情况），讨论和制订今后四个半月的增产节约计划和实现计划的具体措施。在农村方面，每一个公社、生产大队、生产队、生产小组，都要围绕着秋田管理和秋收、秋耕和秋冬播种的准备工作进行讨论并且作出具体的安排。在工业方面，必须把国家分配给各单位的具体计划告诉职工群众，发动每一个厂矿、车间、高炉、转炉、掌子面等基层单位的职工，进行讨论，订出为完成和超额完成国家计划的每月、每旬以至每天的具体指标和完成这些指标的措施。这种讨论，应该包括产量、质量、品种、降低成本、安全生产等五方面。交通运输部门的每一个车站、码头、机车、轮船、汽车，基本建设部门的每一个工程公司、工地、小组，也都要围绕着本部门的几项主要指标，讨论和制定具体的增产节约计划和保证办法。机关、学校、部队及一切事业单位，要发动群众着重讨论节约和有关的生产的问题。这样，经过全民的讨论，挖掘增产节约的潜力，找到切实可行的增产节约措施，把全国人民建设社会主义的积极性进一步调动起来，从而使完成和超额完成国民经济的各项指标得到更加可靠的保证。
    为了保证增产节约计划的实现，要广泛开展增产节约的劳动竞赛。凡是生产条件大体相同的公社、生产大队、生产队、工厂、矿山、车间、班组、车站、码头、机车、轮船、汽车，都要组织竞赛，定期评比，交流经验，及时总结，使一般的和落后的生产单位能够迅速赶上先进单位，把整个生产水平提高一步。在竞赛中，特别要抓紧继续深入开展技术革新、技术革命的群众运动。近两三年来，特别是今年上半年以来，广大工农群众、干部、技术人员作出了大批极有价值的创造发明。在这次增产节约运动中，要在党委领导下，采用领导干部同工人（社员）、技术人员三结合的办法，进一步集中进行整理、审查和鉴定，把那些对于解决当前生产关键有直接作用的、收效最大的和有普遍意义的革新项目，加以总结、提高，使之系统化，迅速普遍推广。在我国，技术革新和技术革命运动的花朵正在盛开，我们应当努力争取更丰硕的果实，使它在生产中充分发挥作用。
    在增产节约运动中，要集中力量，首先保证粮食、钢铁的增产。要把群众的力量，把物力、财力、领导的精力集中到当前的主要任务上来。首先必须坚决贯彻执行农业为基础的方针，加强农业战线，特别是粮食生产战线。各个县和人民公社，要立即发动群众，调出尽可能多的劳动力来投入田间生产。水利等农村基本建设必须服从当前农业生产的需要，在保证当前粮食生产的前提下分期分批地进行。县社工业和副业等各种经营，除了一部分必须维持常年生产的以外，一般都必须同农业生产季节相结合，农闲多办，农忙少办，大忙停办，农忙务农，农闲做工。为了加强农业生产力量，工业各部门都要通过技术革新和技术革命运动，提高劳动生产率，节约人力，来满足新建企业的需要，并把节约下来的一部分人力派到农村中去。在工业方面，要集中力量首先保证钢的增产。所有担负外调生铁、煤炭、矿石等任务的企业职工，都要努力增产并提高质量，充分保证重点钢铁企业的需要。机械制造部门的职工，要集中使用材料和技术力量，首先保证完成矿山设备、运输机械、农业机械、化肥设备等以及备品、配件的生产和配套。交通运输部门的职工，要优先保证粮食和钢铁增产所需要的物资的运输。这样，首先把必要的力量集中到粮、钢增产的主要任务上来，就可以在这些方面做出更大的成绩，使整个国民经济的跃进有更加雄厚的基础。
    在增产节约运动中，一方面要开源，另一方面要节流。要通过这个运动，进一步发扬全民节约的优良传统和社会风气。所有的厂矿、公社、机关、学校、部队，都要努力提高生产效率和工作效率，节约活的劳动和节约粮食、棉布、钢铁、煤炭，爱护机器工具，节约一切可以节约的物资。我们不仅要勤俭建国、勤俭办厂、勤俭办社，而且要勤俭持家，勤俭办一切事业。我们要通过这次运动，在全国人民中进一步养成以艰苦朴素为荣、以奢侈浪费为耻的社会风气。节约工作做得好，我们就可以用同样的人力物力做更多的事情，以加速社会主义建设的速度，就可以增加国家的物资储备，增强国家的经济力量。我国人民有勤俭节约的光荣传统。我们相信，全国人民一定响应中央的号召，进一步把这种光荣传统发扬光大。
    为了圆满地展开增产节约运动，各级领导干部既要领导好生产，又要安排好群众生活。首先要注意劳逸结合，妥善安排劳动与休息的时间。同时，无论在农村和城市，都要把群众的伙食办好。在农村中，在搞好粮食生产的基础上，把粮食管好、用好。农村人民公社的粮食，应当由基本核算单位统收统支，统一管理，全面管好。要积极办好食堂，坚持计划用粮，节约用粮，既要节约，又要吃好。食堂必须有自己的菜地，大搞瓜菜，大搞副食品。城市的党委也要加强对各伙食单位的领导，充分发挥它们的积极性，在不增加人员的条件下，尽一切可能多生产一些副食品。在工业企业中，对于从事高温、高空、严寒、井下作业或其他特别繁重劳动的职工，应当特别注意保证他们的营养。每一个公社和大的厂矿、机关、学校，都应该有一个行政负责人或者党委的负责人管理生活。
    为了把这次的增产节约运动搞好，把广大群众的积极性、创造性充分发动起来，组织起来，迅速在生产上收到实效，关键在于加强领导。为此，各级党组织和行政领导机关的干部，必须立即行动起来，到生产的第一线去，深入公社、生产队、田间中去，到工厂、矿山、车间中去，到车站、码头上去，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，直接参加和领导生产，及时帮助下面解决生产中的关键问题。中央各业务部门的领导干部应当深入到某些主要农作物、特别是粮食的重点产区，深入到重点厂矿企业单位，协同地方党委和各公社、各厂矿党委切实解决具体问题。总之，我们不但要把这次的运动搞好，切实收到增产节约的实效，而且要通过这次运动，把各级干部的领导作风和工作方法提高一步，使领导和群众的关系更加密切，从而为今后的继续跃进创造更好的条件。
    现在已经是8月中旬，今年只剩下四个半月了。时间是极其宝贵的，必须立刻行动起来。在农业方面，必须把田间管理工作做好，力争秋收多多益善；同时要做好秋耕、秋种的准备工作，力争种多些，种好些。在工业方面，必须保证在8、9两个月内使钢产量及其他主要工业产品的产量有大幅度的增长，并且在第四季度再接再厉，使生产有更大的增长。目前的形势对我们十分有利。我们深信，全体共产党员、共青团员、革命干部、全体工人、农民和其他各阶层人民，一定会热烈地响应中央的号召，团结一致，展开一个轰轰烈烈而又踏踏实实的以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动，为完成和超额完成今年国民经济计划而奋斗。
