Our era is one where the East wind prevails over the West wind, where the proletarian revolution advances from victory to victory, where all roads lead to socialism and communism; it is an era of unparalleled and magnificent revolutionary heroism. The proletariat and revolutionary people of the world, seeing the prospects of their victory, are even more high-spirited and have even more soaring fighting will, and are raising the torch of opposing imperialist aggression and striving for world peace everywhere, raising the torch of opposing colonialist enslavement; the people of the socialist camp countries, led by the Soviet Union, are holding high the red flag of building socialism and further advancing towards communism. Heroic figures among the proletariat and revolutionary people are emerging in batches of thousands and tens of thousands.

In our motherland of nearly ten million square kilometers, 650 million heroic people, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the glorious illumination of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, are engaging in an unprecedented heroic struggle to rapidly build socialism and realize communism with an overwhelming momentum. Heroic figures, like stars in the sky, appear on the land of the motherland, holding high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, leading all the working people, constantly advancing, and leaping forward!

We come from the Wei River Plain, where, like everywhere else in the country, heroic flowers bloom in a riot of color. From Tongguan to Baoji, well-known heroic figures who serve as banners for the entire province or the entire country are lined up one after another: Shan Xiuzhen, Ma Tinghai, Zhang Qiuxiang, Liu Shuxian, Liu Hengjie, Liu Xijie, Cao Zhuxiang, Xue Junxiu, Yao Huanzhang, Lu Guilan, Zhao Mengtao, Wang Baojing, etc. The names of heroes are countless. These are all noble figures cultivated by the Party and Chairman Mao, which is a remarkable event unprecedented in history. Like Zhang Qiuxiang, the first female peasant scientist in the country, her cotton has maintained a record of over 1,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu for several years, exceeding the average yield there in the past by ten to twenty times; today, Qiuxiang teams, Qiuxiang fields, and Qiuxiang-style figures are spread all over Shaanxi. Last year, there was a severe drought in Guanzhong, the severity of which exceeded the famine-stricken year of 1929, but a bumper harvest was still achieved. In this struggle to wrest grain from the heavens, there were many drought-resistant models like Yao Huanzhang, who, like the hero Yu the Great in people's dreams for thousands of years, fought day and night to divert the Wei River water to the plateau, passing by their homes without entering. Wang Baojing, an ordinary young peasant, has now become a nationally renowned peasant scientist and a typical representative of the new generation of peasants. The Agricultural Science Research Institute he leads is running science for the peasants in a big way, opening up a broad path. Outside the ancient city of Chang'an, there is a well-known "Communist Youth League Chemical Plant" with a considerable scale, which was founded in 1958 by a few middle school boys and girls with a 250-yuan CYL membership fee, a broken iron pot, and a dilapidated thatched house in the wilderness. The female director of this factory is only over twenty-two years old this year, and the cause they have created has become a red flag for CYL members across the country to build socialism and realize communist ideals. All these advanced figures, like the famous textile worker Zhao Mengtao, are all new people with a communist style. They always put others before themselves, doing everything possible to help others catch up with and surpass their own technical and production levels. They are the torches of communism, illuminating the hearts of hundreds of millions of people and leading hundreds of millions of people to bravely advance in the direction pointed out by the Party. Currently, throughout Shaanxi Province, from inside and outside the Great Wall, the Loess Plateau of northern Shaanxi, the Wei River Basin to the deep mountains and old forests on both sides of the Han River, a million red flag bearers movement is surging and expanding.

This is the image of our era, the spiritual state of the people, and the rich and glorious reality of life. All of this must be reflected in literature and art. The era of revolutionary heroism led by the proletariat requires literature full of heroic spirit that inspires people's revolutionary will.

We live in a vast ocean of new heroic figures. Every day, every hour, what we see with our eyes, what we hear with our ears, and what all our nerves feel are the great achievements created by contemporary heroes with a selfless spirit and heroic spirit. Seeing the magnificent picture of the motherland's land rapidly changing day by day in the hands of heroic figures and the broad masses of people, how can we not be moved? How can we not sing? If our pen and ink are not dedicated to them, to whom shall we dedicate them? In fact, under the education of the Party, our literary and art workers are thinking, talking, and striving to better shape the full image and strong character of new heroic figures day and night. Many of our excellent literary works are dedicating their pages to new heroic figures. Tens of thousands of advanced figures among workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary cadres are both the masters of life and the masters in literary works. In the world of literature and art, Zhu Lao Zhong, Liang Shengbao, and many other heroic men, women, old, and young, are not they forming a revolutionary army, marching forward in a mighty and powerful way? How can this situation not make people happy and not make people excited?

We must enthusiastically cheer the birth and growth of new communist people. Any new thing with communist elements in life, and any spark of communist ideological character among the people, has great revolutionary significance and is therefore worth writing about in a big way; moreover, in the life of our era, the paeans of communism are sung one after another, from north to south, from east to west, resonating throughout the land of the motherland, singing brighter and brighter, with hundreds of millions of people participating in it, gradually becoming a grand chorus of communism!

We must vigorously shape heroic figures, shaping the most revolutionary and combative advanced soldiers among the working class and revolutionary people, depicting their heroic spirit of constantly revolutionizing, despising enemies, despising difficulties, defeating enemies, and overcoming difficulties, and their complex, meticulous, arduous, poetic, and moving struggle life.

In real life, the character of heroes is diverse, and the life of heroes is colorful. Only by placing them in a broad life scene can we write a new and profound era type with both generalizing significance and individual characteristics.

To climb this peak requires a lifetime of effort. The fundamental key is to go deep into reality along the road of intellectualizing workers and peasants and laborizing intellectuals; and to fully arm our minds with Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's writings. This only correct path pointed out to us by the Party and Chairman Mao is something that we all have profound experience in the practice of struggle and the practice of artistic creation.

To become one with the workers and peasants means to thoroughly transform our own lives and thoughts, to laborize and communize, like an alloy in metal, becoming a truly integral part of them. The appearance of a hero can be described, the story of a hero can be collected, but the profound spiritual outlook and the sincere ideological and emotional activities of a heroic figure cannot be collected no matter what, but without these, the appearance of a hero, no matter how realistic, will not be vivid, the story of a hero, no matter how complete, will not be a living story, and it will inevitably lack what we often say, the breath of life and the power of profound emotion flowing between the lines. All of this requires personal experience and personal understanding; the prerequisite for understanding is workerization and laborization. As a fighting member of the workers and peasants, having a common stand, thoughts, feelings, common language with them, and a common sense of responsibility for major and concrete things in the common struggle. Without a common sense of responsibility, common pursuit, and common action, there can be no common understanding, and therefore it is impossible to specifically and profoundly understand them. To understand them, to be able to understand each other in various occasions, even without words, only by a single move, and to understand the entire connection between that move or a few words and the life struggle; to understand the deep ideological and emotional content it contains.

This kind of life experience based on workerization and laborization should also be very rich. That is to say, it is necessary to have a rich experience of fighting together with the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time. Because the nature of artistic imagination and artistic generalization requires that in writing each work or shaping each character, even if it is only a short novella, the author must rely on and use all his life knowledge and struggle experience, otherwise, not only will it be impossible to write heroic figures higher and more typical, but even writing a successful character feature is often quite difficult.

To thoroughly transform our world outlook and to communize our thoughts and feelings, we must seriously study Marxism-Leninism and study Chairman Mao's writings. This is something that cannot be slackened at any time, from beginning to end. Chairman Mao's great writings are priceless treasures in the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. We must study diligently and arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought.

The Marxist world outlook and ideological level of a revolutionary writer directly determine the entire artistic activity process and creation results, and thought is the soul of artistic activity. Sometimes, we take a very moving theme and cannot write it well no matter how we write it, and we cannot put our energy into it, or we always feel that it is not written high, and even we feel countless in our minds about the selection of materials; in many occasions, this is often because we have not yet formed the theme idea of the living materials and works, in ordinary words, that is, we have not yet jumped out of the materials, this jump is the refinement of the theme and the improvement of thought; once the thought jumps out, the writing will proceed smoothly, and the appearance of the work will also be immediately renewed.

As long as we have Mao Zedong Thought, understand how to use the class analysis method to observe social life, our eyes will be bright, the objective world will open up all its secret doors to us, show every corner of it, show the way to the future, and our artistic imagination will grow powerful wings, and fly freely from the height of life and towards the distance of life.

We live in the infinitely happy Mao Zedong era. We can freely describe the working people, who account for the vast majority of mankind; describe their lofty ideals and victorious struggles, and use them to inspire them to move forward. This is truly the highest happiness and the greatest glory for literary and art artists.

Imperialism and all reactionaries tremble in the face of the revolutionary torrent of the people; they tremble in the face of the literature and art of proletarian revolutionary heroism. Modern revisionists, represented by Yugoslavia, spare no effort to oppose literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, oppose expressing the themes of revolutionary struggle, discredit socialist and communist literature, and hate the images of powerful proletarian revolutionary fighters in literary works. The purpose is precisely to disintegrate the revolutionary will of the workers and peasants and to serve imperialism, which is heading towards death.

However, all the tricks of imperialists and modern revisionists are futile. The situation of world literature is also that the East wind prevails over the West wind. Revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism combined with the spirit of the times that inspires people to move forward and all progressive literature are also shining brightly, overwhelming and continuing to overwhelm decadent bourgeois literature and reactionary and decadent revisionist literature.

Precisely because of this, our literature that serves workers, peasants, and soldiers has strong combat significance and great historical significance.

We must listen to the Party's words, listen to Chairman Mao's words, continue to go deep into the masses, work hard to study Chairman Mao's writings, thoroughly transform our thinking; we must learn from the predecessors in the literary and art circles, learn from worker and peasant writers, learn from all comrades, constantly improve our ideological level and artistic expression ability, and strive to fulfill the fighting task of literary creation assigned to us by the Party and the people.

    新英雄人物鼓舞着我们	杜鹏程　王汶石
    我们的时代，是东风压倒西风、是无产阶级革命从胜利走向胜利、是条条道路通向社会主义共产主义的时代，是无比壮丽的革命英雄主义时代。全世界无产阶级和革命人民，看到了自己的胜利前景，意气更风发，斗志更昂扬，到处举起了反对帝国主义侵略、争取世界和平的火炬，举起了反对殖民主义奴役的火炬；以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民，高举着为建成社会主义和进一步奔向共产主义的红旗。无产阶级和革命人民中的英雄人物，正在成千成万地一批一批地涌现出来。
    在我们祖国的近一千万平方公里土地上，六亿五千万英雄的人民，在党和毛主席领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下，为迅速建成社会主义和实现共产主义，正以排山倒海之势，进行史无前例的英勇斗争。英雄人物，像满天繁星似地出现在祖国大地上，他们高举毛泽东思想红旗，带动全体劳动人民，不断前进，飞跃前进！
    我们从渭河平原上来，那里，跟全国各地一样，英雄的花朵，万紫千红。从潼关到宝鸡，作为全省或全国旗帜的著名英雄人物，就一个挨一个：山秀珍、马廷海、张秋香、刘述贤、刘恒杰、刘希杰、曹竹香、薛俊秀、姚焕章、鲁桂兰、赵梦桃、王保京等等，英雄的名字，数也数不完。这都是一些党和毛主席教养出来的崇高的人物，这是历史上从未有过的了不起的大事。像全国第一个农民女科学家张秋香，她的棉花，几年来一直保持着亩产皮棉千斤以上的纪录，高过过去那儿平均产量的十倍到二十几倍；如今，秋香组、秋香田和秋香式的人物，布遍全陕西。去年，关中大旱，其严重程度超过了饿殍遍野的1929年，但却获得了大丰收，在这场与天争粮的斗争里，就有许多姚焕章式的抗旱标兵，像数千年来人们理想中的英雄大禹一样，为把渭河水引上高原，日夜奋战，数过家门而不入。王保京，一个普通的青年农民，如今成了全国著名的农民科学家，成为新的一代农民的典型，他领导的农业科学研究所，为农民大办科学，开创了一个宽广的道路。古长安城外，有一个已具相当规模的著名的“共青团化工厂”，是几个上过中学的男孩子和女孩子，在1958年用二百五十元的团费，一口破铁锅，在旷野里一间破草房里创办起来的。这个厂的女厂长，今年才过二十二岁，他们创造的事业，已经成为全国共青团员们为社会主义建设和实现共产主义理想的一面红旗。所有这些先进人物，都像著名的纺织女工赵梦桃一样，全是具有共产主义风格的新人。他们总是先别人后自己，千方百计帮助别人赶上和超过自己的技术和生产水平。他们是共产主义的火把，照亮了亿万人的心，带动亿万人朝党指出的方向奋勇前进。目前，陕西全省，从长城内外，陕北高原，渭河盆地到汉江两岸的深山老林中，一个百万红旗手运动，正在汹涌澎湃地扩展开来。
    这就是我们的时代景象、人民的精神状态和丰富而光辉的现实生活。这一切，必然要反映到文学艺术中来。无产阶级领导的革命英雄主义时代，需要鼓舞人们革命意志的充满英雄主义气概的文学。
    我们生活在新英雄人物的汪洋大海里，每日每时，眼里见的，耳里听的，和全部神经所感触到的，都是当代英雄们以忘我的精神，豪迈的气魄，创造着伟大的业绩，看到祖国的大地，在英雄人物和广大人民的手里，日新月异地迅速变化着的瑰丽图景，我们怎能不感动？怎能不歌唱？我们的笔墨，不献给他们还献给谁？事实上，在党的教养下，我们的文艺工作者，日夜想的、谈的、努力追求的，便是如何更好地塑造新英雄人物的丰满的形象和强大的性格。我国的许多优秀的文学作品，都是把篇幅献给新英雄人物的。工人、农民、战士和革命干部中成千上万的先进人物，既是生活的主人，又是文学作品中的主人。在文学艺术世界里，朱老忠、梁生宝和其他许多英雄的男女老少，不正是结成了一支革命大军，浩浩荡荡，阔步前进吗？这种情况怎能不叫人高兴，不叫人振奋呢？
    我们要满腔热情地欢呼共产主义新人的诞生和成长。生活里的任何一件具有共产主义因素的新事物，和人民之中的任何一点共产主义思想性格的闪光，都是具有极大革命意义的，因而是值得大书而特书的；更何况，在我们时代的生活里，共产主义的凯歌，一曲接着一曲，从北到南，从东到西，响遍祖国大地，愈唱愈亮，亿万人参加了进来，逐渐变成了一曲共产主义大合唱呢！
    我们要大力塑造英雄人物，塑造那种最富有革命性和战斗性的工人阶级和革命人民中的先进战士，描写他们那种藐视敌人、藐视困难、战胜敌人、战胜困难的不断革命的英雄气概，和他们的复杂细致、艰苦卓绝、充满诗意的动人的斗争生活。
    现实生活中，英雄的性格是多种多样的，英雄的生活是丰富多彩的，只有把他们放在广阔的生活场景上，才能写出富有概括意义和个性特征的崭新而深刻的时代典型来。
    要登上这个高峰，需要作毕生的努力。根本的关键，是沿着工农群众知识化、知识分子劳动化的道路，深入实际；用马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作，把我们的头脑全副武装起来。党和毛主席给我们指出的这一条唯一正确的道路，我们大家都在斗争实践和艺术创作实践中，有着深刻的体会。
    我们要和工农群众打成一片，就是要彻底改造自己的生活和思想，劳动化和共产主义化，像金属里的合金一样，成为他们中的切切实实的一分子。英雄的外貌可以描摩，英雄的故事可以搜集，而英雄人物的深刻的精神风貌和真切的思想感情活动，却是说什么也搜集不来的，但是，没有这些，英雄的外貌再逼真也不会有生气，英雄的故事再完整也不会是活的故事，必然会缺乏我们常说的、在字里行间流动着的生活气息和深刻动人的力量。这一切，需要亲身经验，亲身体会；体会的先决条件，就是工农化、劳动化。作为工农群众中战斗的一员，跟他们有共同的立场、思想、感情，共同的语言，和在共同的斗争中对重大的和具体的事物，具有共同的责任感。没有共同的责任感共同的追求和共同的行动，就不可能有共同的体会，因而也就不可能具体深刻地了解他们。要了解他们，做到在各种场合，即便不用语言，只凭一举一动，就能互相理会，懂得那一举一动或片言只语与生活斗争的全部联系；懂得它所包含的深刻的思想感情的内容。
    这种在工农化、劳动化基础上的生活体会，还应该是十分丰富的。也就是说，要有长期同工农兵群众共同斗争的丰富经历。因为艺术想像和艺术概括的本身，要求在写每一个作品或塑造每一个人物，哪怕只是一篇小小说的时候，作者都必须凭借和运用他的全部生活知识和斗争经验，否则，不但不能把英雄人物写得更高更典型，甚至要写一篇成功的人物特写，也常常是颇为困难的。
    要彻底改造我们的世界观，要使我们思想感情上共产主义化，就必须认真学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛主席的著作，这是自始至终，一时一刻也不能懈怠的。毛主席的伟大著作，是马克思列宁主义宝库中的无价之宝，我们要刻苦钻研，用毛泽东思想把我们武装起来。
    革命作家的马克思主义世界观和思想水平，直接决定着他的全部艺术活动过程和创作结果，思想是艺术活动的灵魂。有时候，我们拿一个很动人的题材，怎么写也写不好，写起来也不上劲，或者总觉得写得不高，甚至于连材料的取舍也感到心中无数；在许多场合，这往往也是由于我们对生活素材和作品的主题思想还没形成，用一句平常的话来说，就是还没从材料中跳出来，这个跳，就是主题的提炼和思想的提高；思想一旦跳出来，写作便会顺利地进行，作品的面貌也会立刻焕然一新。
    只要我们有了毛泽东思想，懂得用阶级分析方法来观察社会生活，我们的眼睛就会明亮，客观世界便会向我们敞开它的一切隐秘的门户，展现出它的每一个角落，展现出通往未来的道路，我们的艺术想像力，才会长上有力的翅膀，从生活的高处，和向着生活的远处，自由地飞翔。
    我们生活在无限幸福的毛泽东时代，我们能够自由地描写占人类绝大多数的工农群众；描写他们的崇高理想和胜利的斗争，并用以鼓舞他们前进，这真是文学艺术家的最高的幸福，最大的光荣。
    帝国主义和一切反动派，在人民的革命洪流面前发抖；在无产阶级革命英雄主义的文学艺术面前发抖。以南斯拉夫为代表的现代修正主义者，不遗余力地反对文艺为工农兵服务，反对表现革命斗争的主题，诋毁社会主义和共产主义文学，仇视文学作品中强大的无产阶级革命战士的形象。其目的，正是为瓦解工农群众的革命斗志，为正在走向死亡的帝国主义效劳。
    然而，帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的一切伎俩，都是徒劳的。世界文学的形势，也是东风压倒西风。鼓舞人们前进、充分体现时代精神的革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的文学和一切进步文学，也正在大放光彩，正在压倒和继续压倒腐朽的资产阶级文学和反动堕落的修正主义文学。
    唯其如此，我们的为工农兵服务的文学，便具有强烈的战斗意义和伟大的历史意义。
    我们一定听党的话，听毛主席的话，继续深入群众，努力学习毛主席著作，彻底改造思想；我们一定向文艺界的前辈学习，向工农作家学习，向全体同志学习，不断提高思想水平和艺术表现能力，努力实现党和人民交给我们的文学创作的战斗任务。
