　　Anhui Intensifies Management Measures to Strive for Autumn Tea Harvest
　　Changsha County Achieves Summer Tea Surpassing Spring Tea, Striving for Autumn Tea Surpassing Summer Tea
　　(Our dispatch) Anhui Province, one of the main tea-producing areas in the country, following a comprehensive bumper harvest of spring and summer tea, is rationally organizing manpower and materials, intensifying autumn tea management, and striving for an autumn tea harvest.
　　As of now, according to incomplete statistics, the province has produced over 456,800 dan of spring and summer tea, an increase of 10% compared to the same period last year. The quality of tea has also generally improved. In Qimen County, the famous "Qihong" tea-producing area, high-grade tea of grade three and above accounted for 76.5% of the total output in spring and summer tea.
　　Based on the summary of tea bumper harvests, Anhui and other regions attach particular importance to autumn tea management this year. At present, autumn plowing and fertilization of tea gardens in the province account for more than 50% of the total area of tea gardens. In the Wuhu area of southern Anhui tea region, more than 256,000 mu of tea gardens have been autumn-plowed, accounting for more than 80% of the harvestable tea area. Various regions have also combined autumn plowing with fertilizer application and weeding. This autumn, the Wuhu area has adopted measures based on the different conditions of tea gardens, such as "burying green manure in high mountain and remote mountain tea gardens; applying farm manure in low mountain and plain tea gardens; applying chemical fertilizers in old and barren tea gardens." Foliar fertilization of tea, which is effective, low-cost, and less labor-intensive, has also been comprehensively promoted. Nine counties including Qimen, Xiuning, Shexian, and Taiping have also actively promoted new fertilization measures such as the plant growth stimulants "copper sulfate" and "naphthylacetic acid."
　　In carrying out autumn tea management, all parts of Anhui have made reasonable arrangements in accordance with the policy of taking grain as the key link, comprehensive development, and overall consideration. All major tea-producing counties and communes have established tea production command headquarters to strengthen the leadership of autumn tea management; party committees at all levels in scattered tea-producing areas have also appointed dedicated personnel to be responsible.
　　(Our dispatch) Changsha County, Hunan Province, has achieved a bumper harvest of summer tea on the basis of a bumper harvest of spring tea. By the end of July, the county had completed 100.5% of the annual plan for the delivery of dry tea, and successfully completed the state procurement task. Now, all tea-producing communes in the county continue to advance victoriously and strive for autumn tea to surpass summer tea.
　　This year, the leading departments of the county have paid close attention to tea production. More than 6,000 mu of new tea gardens have been opened up in the county, and the old tea gardens have been comprehensively cultivated. During the spring tea picking, it was resolutely done to "pick, fertilize, cultivate, initially process, and purchase at the same time." In order to achieve a summer tea yield exceeding spring tea, the county first allocated the chemical fertilizers distributed by the state quantitatively according to the area and growth of tea gardens, so that special fertilizers were used for special purposes. At the same time, it comprehensively promoted methods such as tea garden digging to store water and fertilizer, tea garden pig raising, and using pig manure to fertilize tea, and successively applied fertilizer four times, totaling 3.6 million dan of native miscellaneous fertilizer and earth to cultivate the tea plants. In the picking and processing of summer tea, the county universally promoted the two-handed tea picking method and tea tool reform. In the promotion of the two-handed tea picking method, 5,400 two-handed tea picking experts were first trained, and then the method was comprehensively promoted from master to apprentice, so that two-handed tea picking accounted for 80% of the number of tea pickers. With the further promotion of the two-handed tea picking method, the efficiency of tea picking has increased day by day, ensuring that the tea leaves are not old and that every piece returns home. In the reform of processing tools, full use was made of water power and animal power, and a total of 174 water-powered tea rolling machines, animal-powered tea rolling machines, and lump disintegration and screening machines, 75 indirect fire temperature drying rooms, and more than 1,500 other various semi-mechanized tea processing tools were added and modified.

    安徽狠抓管理措施争取秋茶丰收
    长沙县实现夏茶超春茶再争秋茶超夏茶
    本报讯　全国主要产茶区之一——安徽省，继春、夏茶获得全面丰产以后，正合理组织人力、物力，狠抓秋茶管理，夺取秋茶丰收。
    截至目前为止，全省据不完全统计，已采制春、夏茶四十五万六千八百多担，比去年同期增长了10％。茶叶品质也普遍获得提高。著名“祁红”产地的祁门县，在春、夏茶中三级以上的高级茶就占总产量的76.5％。
    安徽各地在总结茶叶丰产基础上，对今年秋茶管理工作特别重视。现在，全省茶园秋耕、追肥的已占茶园总面积的50％以上。皖南茶区的芜湖专区已有二十五万六千多亩茶园进行了秋耕，占可采茶面积的80％以上；各地在茶园秋耕中还结合追肥锄草。芜湖专区今秋根据茶园不同情况，因地制宜采取了“高山、远山茶园埋绿肥；低山、平地茶园施农肥；老、瘦茶园上化肥”的措施。并全面推行了收效快、成本低、费工少的茶叶根外喷肥。祁门、休宁、歙县、太平等九县，还积极推广植物生长刺激素——“硫酸铜”、“萘乙酸”等新的施肥措施。
    安徽各地在进行秋茶管理中，都根据以粮为纲、全面发展的方针和统筹兼顾的原则，作了合理安排。凡是主要产茶县和公社，都分别成立了茶叶生产指挥部，加强对秋茶管理的领导；分散产茶地区的各级党委也确定了专人负责。
    本报讯　湖南长沙县在春茶大丰收的基础上，夏茶又获得丰收。到7月底，全县已完成交售干茶年计划的100.5％，出色地完成了国家收购任务。现在，全县各个产茶公社继续乘胜前进，力争秋茶赛夏茶。
    今年，这个县领导部门对茶叶生产抓得很紧，全县新辟茶园六千多亩，对老茶园全面进行了中耕培育；在春茶采摘中，坚决做到“边采摘、边施肥、边培育、边初制、边收购”。为了实现夏茶产量超过春茶，这个县首先将国家分配的化肥按茶园面积和生长情况，定量分配，做到专肥专用，同时全面推广了茶园打凼蓄水沤肥、茶园养猪、以猪肥茶等办法，先后共施肥四次，共施土杂肥和壅土培蔸三百六十万担。在采制夏茶中，全县普遍推广双手采茶法和制茶工具改革。在推广双手采茶法中，先培训了双手采茶能手五千四百人，然后以师带徒，全面推广，使双手采茶占采茶人数的80％。随着双手采茶法的进一步推广，采茶工效日益提高，保证了茶叶匹匹不老、片片归家。在加工工具改革上，充分利用水力、畜力，共添制、改制水力揉茶机、畜力揉茶机、解块分筛机等一百七十四部，间接火温烘房七十五间，以及其它各种半机械化制茶工具一千五百多件。（附图片）
