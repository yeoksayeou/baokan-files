Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 11th. The Korean working class, riding the Chollima (Thousand-Li Horse), launched a spirited labor competition from the spring of this year to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea on "August 15th." They overfulfilled the total industrial output value plan for the first half of the year by 7%. In July and the first ten days of August, they further launched a high tide of labor competition to greet their festival with brilliant labor achievements.

    Korean steel workers have taken the lead in the competition. In the first half of this year, they produced more than twice the amount of steel and steel products produced in the entire year of 1944 before liberation. Now they are striving to produce more than 100,000 tons of steel more than planned this year. In July, the workers in the steel sector overfulfilled the total output value plan by 10%, producing 4,500 tons more iron, 1,700 tons more steel, and 1,100 tons more steel products than the average monthly output in the first half of the year.

    On the eve of "August 15th," the staff and workers in the machinery industry departments have continuously broken through technical barriers and trial-produced a variety of new products. The workers and technicians of the Longcheng Machinery Factory combined to produce the first 5,000-kilowatt water turbine in Korea. Workers at the Rakwon Machinery Factory used engines manufactured by the Tokchon Automobile Factory to produce the "Liberation No. 15" bus. They plan to manufacture 100 of these buses before the festival as a gift for the holiday. The staff and workers of the Kanggye Textile Machinery Factory recently successfully trial-produced a 5.5-horsepower small tractor suitable for mountain farming.

    The workers of the various coal mines in Korea, who have already left Japan far behind in terms of per capita coal production, have launched a high-speed tunneling movement and a movement to mine at least 10,000 tons of coal per working face per month since the beginning of this year. They overfulfilled the tunneling plan in the first half of the year. In July, the Shen Xianzhi Youth Work Team of the Lower Coal Mine created a record of 11,300 tons of coal mined in one working face in one month (in the bituminous coal sector). This work team averaged 6.3 tons of coal mined per person per day in July, an increase of 2.3 tons compared to the average of last year.

    The staff and workers of the light industry departments have produced a large amount of cloth, daily necessities, and food to welcome "August 15th." They have also newly created many new products as holiday gifts for the people. Workers at the Pyongyang Textile Factory recently adopted advanced operating methods, increasing the speed of the looms by 20 revolutions per minute. By July 25, they had produced 340,000 meters more cloth than the increased production target to greet "August 15th."

    朝鲜工人以出色劳动成果迎接解放节日
    钢铁工人在竞赛中一马当先　煤矿工人掀起快速掘进运动
    机械工业制成许多新产品　纺织工人纷纷采用先进工作法
    新华社平壤11日电　骑上千里马的朝鲜工人阶级，为了庆祝“八·一五”朝鲜解放十五周年，从今年春季就展开了热火朝天的劳动竞赛，今年上半年超额7％完成了工业总产值计划，在7月份和8月上旬进一步掀起了劳动竞赛的高潮，以辉煌的劳动成绩迎接自己的节日。
    朝鲜的钢铁工人在竞赛中一马当先，他们今年上半年生产了等于解放前1944年全年产量两倍多的钢和钢材。现在他们正在为今年内生产比计划多十万吨以上的钢而努力。7月份钢铁部门的工人又超额10％完成了总产值计划，比上半年平均月产量多生产了四千五百吨铁、一千七百吨钢、一千一百吨钢材。
    机械工业部门的职工们在“八·一五”前夕，不断攻破技术堡垒，试制成了多种新产品。龙城机械厂的工人和技术人员相结合，在朝鲜第一次制成了五千瓩的水轮机。乐原机械厂的工人利用德川汽车工厂制造的发动机，制成了“解放十五号”公共汽车，他们要在节日前夕制造出一百辆这种汽车，作为给节日的献礼。江界纺织机械制造厂的职工们在不久前还试制成功一种适合山地耕作的五点五马力的小型拖拉机。
    在按人口平均煤产量方面已把日本远远抛在后面的朝鲜各煤矿的工人，今年以来展开了高速度掘进运动和每个掌子面每月至少采煤一万吨的运动。今年上半年他们超额完成了掘进计划。在7月份下面煤矿的沈贤植青年作业班创造了一个掌子面一个月采煤一万一千三百吨的最高纪录（在烟煤部门中），这个作业班在7月份平均每人每天采煤六点三吨，比去年平均增加了二点三吨。
    轻工业部门的职工生产了大量的布匹、日用品、食品，来迎接“八·一五”，他们还新制成了许多种新产品作为给人民的节日礼品。平壤纺织工厂的工人最近采用了先进的作业法，使布机每分钟的转速提高了二十转，到7月25日为止，他们就比迎接“八·一五”的增产指标还多生产了三十四万米布。
