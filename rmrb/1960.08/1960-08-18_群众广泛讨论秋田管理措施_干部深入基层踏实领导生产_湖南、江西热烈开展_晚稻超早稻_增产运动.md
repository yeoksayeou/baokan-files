Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 17th: After the basic completion of the early rice harvest and late rice transplanting in Hunan Province, various localities have universally mobilized the masses to widely launch the campaign of "Late Rice Catching Up with Early Rice, Surpassing Early Rice" to strive for a bumper harvest throughout the year.

Mobilizing the masses to summarize the experience of this year's early rice bumper harvest and promoting autumn production through summer efforts is a prominent feature of Hunan Province's campaign to make late rice catch up with and surpass early rice. Many areas, while harvesting early rice, have carried out mass activities to summarize the experience of bumper harvests at all levels and have assessed the technical measures for late rice production, especially various measures to improve the level of field management. In the mass discussions, it was unanimously agreed that eliminating the late rice regreening period, early middle cultivation, early topdressing, rational irrigation and drainage, and prevention and control of pests and diseases are the central links to achieving late rice catching up with and surpassing early rice. After summarizing the experience of this year's early rice bumper harvest, the Changde Special District, in view of the fact that rainfall in many counties in August and September this year was relatively low, quickly carried out drought prevention preparations for water storage, water conservation, water saving, and early repair and replacement of water lifting tools. According to the experience of Ningxiang County in shortening the regreening period and achieving increased production by cleverly applying fertilizer to early rice, fertilizer was immediately applied to 180,000 mu of late rice, making the 80,000 mu planted earlier quickly turn green.

Continuing to consolidate the labor force concentrated during the "Double Rush" period to improve field management, and cadres going deep into the front lines to discover and solve problems in a timely manner on the spot, are effective measures for Hunan Province to ensure that late rice catches up with and surpasses early rice. The province continues to arrange 80% of the labor force to engage in agricultural production. The Provincial Party Committee and the Party Committees of various places, cities, counties, and communes have also established more than 1,000 production front-line command posts at all levels, with secretaries in production teams and work groups, implementing field office work. More than 200,000 cadres have also been drawn from all levels across the province to go deep into the front line of production, participate in production, and actively lead autumn planting and field management. When Meng Zhaohe, the first secretary of the Guiyang County Party Committee, went deep into the first work group of the Jile Production Team of Zhangshi Commune, he discovered that 1.5% of the rice seedlings were missing hills in a 1.2 mu late rice field in Kugua Cave. He immediately worked with the commune cadres and the masses to carefully analyze the characteristics of this year's late rice growth, put forward four measures to comprehensively strengthen late rice management, and fixed 85 people to strengthen early-stage late rice management. Now, the 700 mu of late rice in the entire production team has been fully inspected and replanted, achieving full seedlings in every field, and the early planted ones have begun to tiller. After the Guiyang County Party Committee promoted the problems discovered by Secretary Meng Zhaohe and the solutions in the county, the early field management of late rice in the whole county was strengthened, promoting the development of the mass movement of late rice catching up with early rice.

Now, Hunan Province is taking advantage of the favorable opportunity when the "Double Rush" is basically over and the mid-season rice has not yet begun to be harvested, and is actively carrying out a mass shock fertilizer accumulation movement, so that the province's late rice will not only catch up with early rice in terms of intensive cultivation and field management, but also ensure that the quantity and quality of fertilizer and rational fertilization also exceed the level of early rice.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, August 17th: Under the guidance of the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation and grasping grain first, Jiangxi has launched a "Three Guarantees" (guaranteeing the area of one-season late rice, guaranteeing the area of two-season late rice, guaranteeing the area of sweet potatoes and other miscellaneous grains), and "Two Surpasses" (late rice yield surpassing early rice, autumn grain yield surpassing summer grain) production increase campaign. The area of late rice and miscellaneous grain crops that are being rush-planted is being expanded again and again, making rapid progress at high speed. As of the 12th, the area of single-season late rice rushed-planted in the province has exceeded the planting plan by 10%, the area of two-season late rice transplanted has expanded by more than 35% compared with last year, and the area of late sweet potatoes, late corn, late soybeans, and other miscellaneous grain crops rushed-planted has reached more than 6.58 million mu. After completing the original expansion plan, many areas are taking advantage of the victory to advance and strive to plant more and more.

This year, Jiangxi has achieved great success in the production of spring-ripening crops and summer-ripening crops, and the situation on the agricultural front in the province is very good. In order to strive for more grain production in autumn, the Party committees at all levels, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, led the masses to launch a vigorous "Three Guarantees and Two Surpasses" production increase campaign. In this movement, the first secretaries of the Party committees at all levels personally took command, and nearly 500,000 cadres insisted on going deep into the front line of production. On the one hand, they widely and deeply publicized the important significance of guaranteeing increased autumn grain production to the masses, and on the other hand, they practically led and mobilized the masses to expand planting as much as possible. The 100,000 cadres and 700,000 commune members in Shangrao Special District launched a high tide of checking and guaranteeing the area, so that the daily progress of late rice transplanting jumped from more than 160,000 mu to more than 250,000 mu. After completing the original two-season late rice planting plan, the cadres and commune members in Yichun Special District further checked the area and tapped the potential to continue expanding planting. Gaoan, Fenyi, Wanzai, Tonggu and other counties in this special district expanded the planting of late rice by 150,000 mu in a few days by comprehensively checking vacant fields, water sources, and vacant land in reservoirs and canals. In Xiushui County, Jiujiang Special District, all the early rice fields and late rice seedling fields with good water conservancy conditions that had not been planted with late rice were planted with late rice. The fields with poor water conservancy conditions but where water sources could be found were planted with late rice, and some mid-season rice fields that matured early and began to be harvested were planted with late rice. In this way, the county expanded the planting of late rice by more than 10,000 mu. Reclaiming land around the lake and opening up lake fields and sandbars is one of the main measures for expanding the planting of late rice in the Poyang Lake area. Commune members in more than a dozen counties in this area are seizing the season when the lake water recedes to reclaim land and rush to plant.

Grasp both staple food and miscellaneous grains. In addition to rushing to plant miscellaneous grains on arable land, various localities have generally adopted methods such as reclaiming wasteland, intercropping, mixed cropping, and making full use of scattered land to vigorously expand the planting of miscellaneous grains. After the 15 counties and cities in Yichun Special District adopted the above methods to expand planting, the planting area of sweet potatoes expanded by 390,000 mu compared with last year, and the area of sesame and other miscellaneous grains expanded by more than 60,000 mu.

While vigorously rushing to plant and expand planting, various localities have mobilized and organized the masses to grasp field management practically with high standards and high quality requirements. People's communes in various counties in Ji'an Special District implemented the "six fixings" responsibility system of fixing leaders, fixing tasks, fixing labor, fixing quality, fixing time, and fixing work points, dividing the troops into two groups, one focusing on weeding and topdressing, and the other focusing on accumulating and delivering fertilizer. In six days, Yongxin County in this special district universally carried out one weeding and one topdressing for 340,000 mu of late rice, of which 67% completed two weedings and two topdressings, all achieving sufficient water and fertilizer, with no wasteland and no weeds.

    群众广泛讨论秋田管理措施
    干部深入基层踏实领导生产
    湖南、江西热烈开展“晚稻超早稻”增产运动
    新华社长沙17日电　湖南省抢收早稻和抢插晚稻的工作基本结束，各地普遍发动群众广泛开展“晚稻赶早稻，超早稻”运动，力夺全年丰收。
    发动群众总结今年早稻丰收经验，以夏促秋，是湖南省开展晚稻赶早稻超早稻丰产运动的突出特点。许多地区在抢收早稻时，就层层开展了群众性的总结丰产经验的活动，对晚稻生产的技术措施，特别是提高田间管理水平的各种措施进行了鉴定。群众讨论中一致认为，消灭晚稻回青期，早中耕，早追肥，合理排灌，防治病虫害等，是实现晚稻赶早稻超早稻的中心环节。常德专区在总结今年早稻丰收的经验后，针对今年8、9月许多县雨量偏少的特点，迅速开展了蓄水、保水、节约用水和及早整修、添置好提水工具的防旱准备。宁乡县根据早稻巧施肥能够缩短回青期获得增产的经验，立即给十八万亩晚稻施了肥，使早插的八万多亩迅速转青。
    继续巩固“双抢”时集中的劳动力搞好田间管理，干部深入第一线，及时就地发现问题，解决问题，是湖南省保证晚稻赶早稻超早稻的有效措施。全省继续安排了80％的劳动力大干农业生产。省委和各地、市、县、公社党委还层层设立了一千多个生产前线指挥所，书记在生产队、作业组，实行田间办公。全省各级还抽出二十多万干部深入生产第一线，参加生产，积极领导秋种和田间管理。桂阳县委第一书记孟昭鹤同志深入到樟市公社极乐生产队第一作业组时，在苦瓜洞一丘一点二亩的晚稻田里，发现有1.5％的禾苗缺蔸，他立即和公社干部群众一起认真分析了今年晚稻生长的特点，提出了四条措施，全面加强晚稻管理，同时还固定了八十五人加强晚稻前期管理。现在，全生产队七百亩晚稻已全面进行了查苗补蔸，做到了丘丘全苗，插得早的已开始分蘖。桂阳县委将孟昭鹤书记所发现的问题和解决问题的办法在全县推广后，使全县的晚稻都加强了前期的田间管理，促进了晚稻赶早稻群众运动的开展。
    现在，湖南省乘“双抢”基本结束，中稻还未开始收割的有利时机，正积极开展群众性的突击积肥运动，使全省的晚稻不但在精耕细作、田间管理的水平赶上早稻，而且保证在肥料的数量、质量和合理施肥中，也超过早稻的水平。
    据新华社南昌17日电　江西各地在以农业为基础首先抓粮食的思想指导下，掀起了“三保”（保一季晚稻面积、保二季晚稻面积、保红薯等杂粮面积）、“两超”（晚稻产量超早稻、秋粮产量超夏粮）增产运动。正在抢种的晚稻和杂粮作物面积一扩再扩，以高速度突飞猛进。到12日止，全省抢种的一季晚稻已超过种植计划10％，二季晚稻插秧面积已比去年扩大35％以上，抢种的晚甘薯、晚玉米、晚大豆等杂粮作物已达六百五十八万多亩。许多地区在完成原定扩种计划以后，正乘胜前进，力争多种再多种。
    今年，江西各地春熟作物、夏熟作物的生产取得了巨大成绩，全省农业战线上的形势极好。为了争取秋季增产更多的粮食，各级党委根据省委指示，领导群众掀起了一个声势浩大的“三保两超”增产运动。在这个运动中，各级党委第一书记亲自挂帅，近五十万名干部坚持深入生产第一线，一方面广泛深入地向群众宣传保增产秋粮的重要意义，一方面脚踏实地领导和发动群众尽力扩种。上饶专区十万干部和七十万社员掀起了查面积保面积的高潮，使晚稻插秧日进度由原来十六万多亩猛跃到二十五万亩以上。宜春专区在完成原定二季晚稻种植计划以后，广大干部和社员又进一步查面积、挖潜力继续扩种。这个专区的高安、分宜、万载、铜鼓等县，通过全面查空闲田、查水源、查水库水圳空地，奋战几天，又扩种晚稻十五万亩。九江专区修水县把未种晚稻的水利条件好的早稻田和晚稻秧田全部种上晚稻，水利条件不好，但可以设法解决水源的田，种上晚稻，一部分成熟早开始收割的中稻田，种植晚稻，这样，全县又扩种晚稻一万多亩。围湖垦荒，大开湖田洲地，是鄱阳湖地区扩种晚稻的主要措施之一，这个地区十多个县的人民公社社员都抓紧湖水退落季节，开荒抢种。
    既抓主粮，又抓杂粮。各地除突击抢种耕地上的杂粮以外，普遍采取开荒、套种、混作和充分利用零星土地等办法，大力扩种杂粮。宜春专区十五个县、市采取上述办法扩种以后，甘薯种植面积比去年扩大了三十九万亩，芝麻等杂粮面积扩大了六万多亩。
    各地在大力抢种扩种的同时，都发动和组织群众以高标准、高质量的要求切切实实狠抓田间管理。吉安专区各县人民公社实行定领导、定任务、定劳力、定质量、定时间、定工分的“六定”责任制，兵分两路，一路大抓耘田追肥，一路大搞积肥送肥。这个专区的永新县在六天时间内，就为三十四万亩晚稻普遍进行了一耘一追肥，其中67％完成了二耘二追肥，全部作到了水足肥饱、无荒无草。
