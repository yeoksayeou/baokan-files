    Protesting British Imperialist Colonial Suppression
    Aden Workers' General Strike
    All-China Federation of Trade Unions Sends Telegram to Express Support
    Xinhua News Agency, August 16th: According to news from Aden, Aden workers began a general strike on the morning of the 15th to protest the British imperialists' August 1st enactment of a law depriving Aden workers of the right to strike.
    Aden's trade union leaders said that the purpose of this law is to undermine the power of trade unions. They called for a symbolic strike on August 8th against the decree. Since then, the trade union has held a one-hour strike every day. Then, on the 15th, the general strike began.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the Aden Trade Union Council, severely condemning the British colonial authorities for forcibly passing a decree prohibiting Aden workers from striking.
    In the telegram, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions expressed its firm support for the heroic struggle of the Aden workers and wished them victory.
