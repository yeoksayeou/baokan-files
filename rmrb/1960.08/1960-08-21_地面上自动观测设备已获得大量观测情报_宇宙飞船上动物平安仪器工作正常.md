Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 20th: According to materials obtained, the condition of the animals on the satellite-type spaceship is good, and the instruments are working normally.

Materials received one and a half hours after the launch of the spaceship indicate that the pulse and respiratory rate of the animals are within normal fluctuations. Telemetric data of physiological parameters show that the animals withstood the launch and orbital entry phases of the spacecraft well.

Before launch, the dog "Little Arrow's" pulse was 90 beats per minute, and its respiratory rate was 60 breaths per minute. During the entry into orbit, the pulse increased to 160 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate to 125 breaths per minute. One and a half hours into the flight, the pulse was 65 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute.

Before launch, the dog "Squirrel's" pulse was 75 beats per minute, and its respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute. During the satellite's entry into orbit, the pulse reached 150 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate reached 240 breaths per minute. One and a half hours into the flight, the pulse was 72 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute.

Data shows that the physiological functions of the animals are normal under weightless conditions during the flight along the satellite orbit. Animal images are currently being received through the television system, and this material also proves that physiological functions are normal. Records of the animals' feeding have been obtained.

The air pressure, temperature, composition, and humidity in the sealed cabin are maintained within the specified standards. Throughout the flight, the air temperature in the sealed cabin has been maintained at around 20 degrees Celsius, and the pressure at 760 mm of mercury.

Many ground receiving stations are confidently receiving signals from the "Signal" transmitter.

The orbital elements of the satellite-type spacecraft, corrected based on measurement data, are as follows: an orbital period of 90.7 minutes, a perigee altitude of 306 kilometers, an apogee altitude of 340 kilometers, and an orbital inclination to the equatorial plane of 64 degrees and 57 minutes.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 20th: The second Soviet spaceship continues to operate normally. As of 15:30 Beijing time on the 20th, it had orbited the Earth sixteen times.

According to newly obtained radio telemetry data, all instruments on the spacecraft are working normally. Necessary conditions for animal life activities are continuously maintained in the sealed cabin of the spacecraft. Systematic television observation and filming of the animals’ condition have been conducted.

From the films, it can be seen that the animals' condition is satisfactory. At times, the animals’ activity levels increased.

The most recently observed data are as follows: The time for the spaceship to orbit the Earth once is 90.72 minutes, the altitude of the perigee of the orbit is 306 kilometers, and the altitude of the apogee is 339 kilometers. Due to atmospheric drag, its orbital period is shortened by 0.003 minutes per day. The angle between its orbital plane and the Earth's equatorial plane is 64 degrees, 57.3 minutes.

All automatic ground observation equipment is working normally and has obtained a large amount of observational intelligence. Electronic computers continuously determine the orbital parameters of the spacecraft based on this information.

    地面上自动观测设备已获得大量观测情报
    宇宙飞船上动物平安仪器工作正常
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：根据已获得的材料看来，卫星式宇宙飞船上的动物情况良好，仪器工作正常。
    在宇宙飞船发射一个半小时后收到的材料表明，动物的脉搏和呼吸频数是在正常波动幅度之内。生理参数遥测数据表明，动物很好地经受住了飞船发射和进入轨道的阶段。
    “小箭”狗在发射前脉搏是九十次，呼吸频数是六十次。在飞船进入轨道期间，脉搏增高到一百六十次，呼吸频数是一百二十五次。在飞行了一个半小时以后，脉搏是六十五次，呼吸频数是二十四次。
    “松鼠”狗在发射前脉搏是七十五次，呼吸频数是二十四次。在卫星进入轨道期间，脉搏达一百五十次，呼吸频数达二百四十次。在飞行一个半小时以后，脉搏为七十二次，呼吸频数是十二次。
    数据表明，在沿卫星轨道飞行期间，动物在失重条件下的生理机能是正常的。目前正在通过电视系统接收动物形象，这方面材料也证明，生理机能是正常的。记录到了动物取食情况。
    密封舱中空气压力和温度及其成分和湿度都维持在规定标准范围内。整个飞行期间，密封舱空气温度都在摄氏二十度左右，压力为七百六十毫米水银柱。
    许多地面接收站正在有把握地接收“信号”发射机发出的讯号。
    根据测量材料校正的卫星式飞船轨道要素值如下：运行周期九十点七分钟，近地点高度三百零六公里，远地点高度三百四十公里，轨道同赤道平面交角六十四度五十七分。
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联第二个宇宙飞船继续正常运行。截至20日北京时间十五时半止，它已绕地球运行了十六圈。
    根据新得到的无线电遥测的材料证明，宇宙飞船上的全部仪器工作正常。在宇宙飞船的密封舱中，继续保持着动物生命活动所必需条件。对动物的状况进行了系统的电视观察，拍摄了电影。
    从影片上可以看出，动物的状况是令人满意的。有些时候，动物的活动积极性增加了。
    最近观测到的数据材料如下：宇宙飞船绕地球运行一周的时间是九十点七二分钟，运行轨道近地点的高度是三百零六公里，远地点的高度是三百三十九公里。由于大气的阻力，它运行的周期每昼夜要缩短○·○○三分钟。它的运行轨道平面同地球赤道平面的交角是六十四度五十七点三分。
    地面上的全部自动观测设备工作正常，并且已经获得了大量观测情报。电子计算机根据这些情报不断地确定出宇宙飞船运行的轨道参数。
