Plant More Late Autumn Crops
	By People's Daily Commentator

	The primary task on the agricultural front at present is to strengthen the field management of autumn crops and strive for a bumper harvest of autumn grain and various economic crops. This is the key to realizing the annual agricultural production plan. At the same time, mobilizing the masses to plant more miscellaneous grains, potatoes, beans, and other late autumn crops is also an important aspect of implementing the policy of planting more and harvesting more, and high yield and more harvest. Late autumn crops generally have a short growth period, and as long as they are planted and managed well, the returns are considerable. In areas affected by drought and flood disasters, planting more late autumn crops is an effective measure for preventing disasters and preparing for famine, and should be earnestly grasped as a season of production, and should not be neglected.
	Our country has the habit of planting late autumn crops in various places, and has cultivated many excellent varieties. Around the "Beginning of Autumn" (立秋), various late autumn crops, such as sweet potatoes, potatoes, mung beans, late millet, small millet, sesame, cowpeas, late soybeans, buckwheat, turnips, and many kinds of vegetables, can be planted. All localities should, according to local customs and natural conditions of the year, follow the principle of planting whatever can be planted and planting as much as possible, and plant all the land that can be planted.
	Planting all the land that can be planted means that when determining the planting plan, we should not only see the large pieces of land, but also the small pieces of land; we should not only find ways on the uncultivated open land, but also find ways in the cultivated farmland, and utilize all the possibilities, big and small.
	According to this year's situation, what aspects should be paid special attention to? We believe that the first is replanting. In many areas, due to drought, flood disasters, and other reasons, some "tails" were dragged in summer planting and were not sown. In some of the planted farmlands, there are also phenomena of missing seedlings and broken ridges. Planting the unplanted and replanting the missing seedlings can expand the planting area a lot. The second is intercropping and relay planting. In many areas, this method can be used. The Party Committee of Dalun Commune in Taizhou County, Jiangsu Province, organized cadres and experienced farmers to arrange stubble by stubble, plot by plot, intercropping sesame and sweet potatoes in peanut fields, intercropping late corn and vegetables in taro fields, and replanting carrots, buckwheat, and potatoes in early and mid-season rice, early summer corn, and soybean fields, which is equivalent to increasing the planting of more than 26,000 mu of late autumn crops, and the multiple cropping index reached 286%. The third is to increase replanting. After the harvest of early rice, early corn, etc. in the southern regions, efforts should be made to plant another season of late rice or another season of other late autumn crops; after the harvest of spring wheat in some areas of Northeast, Inner Mongolia and Northwest, efforts should be made to plant buckwheat, vegetables and various forage crops to expand the replanting area according to local conditions. The fourth is to widely plant "ten edges" (十边 - meaning edges of fields, roads, houses etc). As long as everyone is mobilized to check and find, some plantable empty fields and gaps can be found. The Pingyin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Shandong Province, led cadres and members throughout the county to find space everywhere, and found more than 60,000 mu of vacant land in a few days, and have planted various late autumn crops.

    多种一些晚秋作物	本报评论员
    当前农业战线的首要任务是加强秋收作物的田间管理，千方百计争取秋粮和各种经济作物全部丰收。这是实现全年农业生产计划的关键。与此同时，发动群众多种一些杂粮、薯类、豆类等晚秋作物，也是贯彻多种多收和高产多收方针的一个重要方面。晚秋作物的生长期都不很长，只要种好管好了，收益是相当大的。在发生旱、涝灾害的地区，多种晚秋作物，更是防灾备荒的有效措施，应该作为一季生产，切实抓好，不可忽视。
    我国各地都有种植晚秋作物的习惯，并且培育了不少优良品种。在“立秋”前后，各种晚秋作物，如甘薯、马铃薯、绿豆、晚谷子、小糜谷、芝麻、豇豆、晚大豆、荞麦、蔓青和许多种蔬菜，都是可以种的。各地应该根据当地的习惯和本年的自然条件，按照能种什么，就种什么，能种多少，就种多少的原则，把一切能种的土地全部种上。
    把一切能种的土地全部种上，这就是说，在确定播种计划的时候，不只要看到大块土地，而且要看到小块土地，不只在未种的空地上想办法，而且在已种的农田里想办法，把大大小小的可能性都利用起来。
    根据今年的情况，应该特别注意哪些方面呢？我们认为，第一是补种。不少地区在夏种的时候，由于旱涝灾害等等原因，拖了一些“尾巴”没有下种。已经种上的，有些农田也有缺苗断垅的现象，把未种的种上，把缺苗的补上，就能扩大不少播种面积。二是间种、套种。在许多地区，这种方法都是可以用的。江苏泰州县大抡公社党委组织干部、老农逐片逐块安排茬口，在花生田里套种芝麻、山芋，在芋头田里间种晚玉米、蔬菜，在早中稻、早夏玉米、黄豆田里复种胡萝卜、荞麦、马铃薯，等于增种晚秋作物二万六千多亩，复种指数达到286％。三是增加复种。南方地区在早稻、早玉米等收获之后，应该力争多插一季晚稻，或者多种一季别的晚秋作物；东北、内蒙古和西北一些地区，在春小麦收获之后，应该根据当地的条件，力争多种荞麦、蔬菜和各种饲料作物，扩大复种面积。四是广种“十边”。只要发动大家查一查，找一找，就能找出一些可种的空田隙地。中共山东平阴县委领导全县干部和社员到处找缝插针，几天找出空闲地六万余亩，并已种上各种晚秋作物。
