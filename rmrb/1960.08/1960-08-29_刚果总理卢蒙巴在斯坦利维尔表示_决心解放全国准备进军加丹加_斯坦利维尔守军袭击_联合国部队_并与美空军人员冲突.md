Xinhua News Agency, August 28th, Stanleyville Dispatch: Congolese Republic Prime Minister Lumumba, upon arriving in Stanleyville, the capital of Orientale Province, on the 27th, stated at the airport that he wants to completely liberate the Congo, and all Congolese soldiers mobilized in Stanleyville are ready to march on Katanga Province. Orientale Province is Lumumba's hometown. It is reported that although "UN forces" have entered Stanleyville, the Congolese troops there have not laid down their arms and until recently still controlled the airport. They are in high spirits, determined to fight to safeguard the Congo's independence and unity.

It is reported that shortly before Lumumba arrived at Stanleyville airport, the Congolese troops there attacked Canadian and Swedish officials of the "UN forces" Stanleyville branch. The Congolese troops holding the Stanleyville airport, upon hearing that Belgian paratroopers were landing nearby, surrounded a US Air Force "Globemaster" aircraft operating there and clashed with the American military personnel on board.

When Lumumba arrived at Stanleyville airport, the welcoming crowd shouted thunderous cries of "Independence." Lumumba reviewed the Congolese troops assembled at the airport, and then walked to the square in front of his official residence, where the Congolese troops conducted a military exercise to defeat the Tshombe secessionist group in Katanga Province. The highly spirited Congolese soldiers defeated the opposing "army" in the exercise and arrested the person playing the traitor "Tshombe." This was followed by a military parade of eight hundred Congolese soldiers. As previously reported, the Congolese central government is mobilizing troops to fight against the imperialist lackey, the Tshombe secessionist group in Katanga Province, and on the morning of the 27th, it captured the "capital" of the Kalonji secessionist group in Kasai Province, Bakwanga, which is also manipulated and supported by imperialism. Currently, this Congolese government army has arrived at the border between Kasai Province and Katanga Province. Supported by the people who urgently demand national independence and unity, when the Congolese government army captured Bakwanga, no one destroyed a bridge or damaged a road to prevent them from advancing. The people in other parts of Kasai Province are also looking forward to the arrival of the government army soon.

    刚果总理卢蒙巴在斯坦利维尔表示
    决心解放全国准备进军加丹加
    斯坦利维尔守军袭击“联合国部队”并与美空军人员冲突
    新华社28日讯　斯坦利维尔消息：刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴27日在到达东方省省会斯坦利维尔时，在机场上发表讲话说，他要完全解放刚果，在斯坦利维尔动员起来的所有刚果士兵都准备向加丹加省进军。东方省是卢蒙巴的故乡。据报道，虽然“联合国军”已经开进斯坦利维尔，但是那里的刚果军队一直没有放下他们的武器，直到最近还控制着那里的机场。他们斗志昂扬，决心为维护刚果的独立和统一而斗争。
    据报道，就在卢蒙巴到达斯坦利维尔机场前不久，那里的刚果军队袭击了“联合国军”驻斯坦利维尔分部的加拿大籍和瑞典籍官员。而坚守在斯坦利维尔机场的刚果军队，也由于听说比利时伞兵在附近着落，包围了一架飞到那里活动的美国空军“全球霸王式”飞机，并且同飞机上的美国军人发生冲突。
    在卢蒙巴到达斯坦利维尔机场的时候，欢迎的人群向他发出了雷鸣般的“独立”的呼喊声。卢蒙巴检阅了集合在机场上的刚果军队，然后他走到他的官邸前的广场上，在那里，刚果军队进行了一场讨伐加丹加省冲伯分裂集团的军事演习。情绪高昂的刚果士兵在演习中击溃了对方的“军队”，并且逮捕了扮演卖国贼“冲伯”的人。接着是八百名刚果士兵的军事阅兵。前已报道，刚果中央政府正在调集军队讨伐帝国主义走狗加丹加省的冲伯分裂集团，并已在27日上午攻克另一受到帝国主义操纵和支持的卡隆吉分裂集团的“首都”——开赛省的巴克旺加。目前，这支刚果政府军已抵达开赛省同加丹加省的交界处。由于受到迫切要求全国独立和统一的人民的支持，刚果政府军在攻下巴克旺加时，没有人炸毁一座桥、破坏一条公路来阻止他们前进。开赛省其它地方的人民，也都盼望政府军早日来到。
