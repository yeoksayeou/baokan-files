    Helping basic-level cadres improve their ideological style, solve practical difficulties, and arrange the lives of commune members
    Gaochun County Commune Cadres Carry Out "Three Helps" Activities
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) The CCP Gaochun County Committee News Group reports: In Jiangsu Province, cadres from Gaochun County's county and commune levels, by eating, living, laboring, and consulting with commune members, are carrying out "Three Helps" activities: helping production team cadres improve their ideological style, solve practical difficulties, and arrange the lives of commune members.
    Helping production team cadres improve their ideological style mainly involves using methods such as studying, guiding, comparing, talking, and doing. "Studying" includes helping basic-level cadres study Mao Zedong's works and the Party's guidelines and policies to improve their ability to analyze practical problems. It also involves studying and summarizing the practical work experience and production techniques of basic-level cadres in doing their work well, managing production, and managing life. "Guiding" improves the leadership level of basic-level cadres through mentorship at all levels. "Comparing" involves planting red flags and setting up pacesetters at any time to encourage enthusiasm. "Talking" involves communicating sincerely with team cadres and commune members, being their confidants, so that one has a thousand eyes and ten thousand ears to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. "Doing" involves setting an example with one's own model actions to encourage and inspire production team cadres.
    In terms of helping production team cadres solve practical difficulties, the methods adopted are: encouraging, excavating, arranging, opening, and supporting. "Encouraging" means first encouraging production teams and brigades that have actual difficulties in production, helping them establish lofty ambitions. "Excavating" means helping them fully tap their potential in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources to solve difficulties based on the actual difficulties of the production team. "Arranging" means helping the teams in difficulty to make careful arrangements and formulate plans. "Opening" means helping the teams in difficulty to increase income by developing new production avenues according to local conditions while also paying attention to saving non-production expenses. "Supporting" means organizing cooperation among teams on the premise of equal value exchange.
    Helping production team cadres arrange the lives of commune members mainly involves methods such as participating, managing, building, controlling, and training. "Participating" means that after the county and commune cadres go down, they must participate in eating in the public canteens, and generally go to the canteens that are run poorly, so as to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. "Managing" means that each person helps manage a model canteen well, and after gaining experience, promotes it in a timely manner. "Building" means helping all canteens establish a family foundation, so that melons and vegetables fill the gardens, livestock abound, and there is a variety of food. "Controlling" means establishing various democratic management systems with the focus on managing and using grain well. "Training" means helping to train accountants and cooks, and constantly improving their technical level and management capabilities.
    The "Three Helps" activities first began in Fengshan Commune in this county. After this commune transferred forty-three cadres from directly subordinate units to the production teams to carry out the "Three Helps," it quickly brought the original five brigades and thirty-four production teams, which were lagging behind in their work, up to the advanced level, becoming red flag units in the county. The Gaochun County Party Committee promoted the experience of Fengshan Commune's "Three Helps" at an enlarged meeting of the County Party Committee attended by the first secretaries of the commune Party committees. At the same time, it transferred 593 cadres from the county and communes to the brigades and production teams to carry out the "Three Helps" activities. Practice has proven that organizing county and commune-level cadres to go deep into the grassroots to carry out the "Three Helps" has five benefits: First, it provides county and commune-level cadres with clear goals and requirements for going deep into the front line of production and adhering to the "Four Togethers," strengthening the cadres' sense of responsibility. Taking the county-level organs as an example, in the past, about half of the 52 section chiefs and bureau directors who were transferred to the countryside were still busy with affairs at home and could not go deep down frequently. After carrying out the "Three Helps," some of them were responsible for a specific area, and some were assigned to a specific team. They ate in the canteen and worked in the fields, truly helping the team cadres solve specific problems. Second, through the "Three Helps," cadres are prompted to go deep down, both hands-on and brain-on, and their work style is becoming more and more solid and meticulous. The prominent manifestations are: there are fewer cursory inspections, and more going down to settle down, participating in production, offering ideas, and finding ways to help solve problems; unprepared meetings have been reduced, and planned discussions and handling of problems have increased. The Dongba Commune originally lacked overall planning in its work, and often called up commune and brigade cadres for meetings. After carrying out the "Three Helps," the entire commune was divided into five areas, with members of the commune Party committee standing committee in charge. The other 19 commune cadres were all assigned to the teams, and it was stipulated that large meetings should be held in the fields, and commune meetings should be held in the areas, ensuring that the cadres participated in production and led production in a down-to-earth manner. Third, due to the development of the "Three Helps" activities, the political and ideological level and leadership ability of the brigade and production team cadres have been improved, and their work style has been further improved. In order to help team cadres improve their theoretical and political level, the Gucheng and Zhuanqiang communes have set up more than 20 amateur Party schools in different areas. The county and commune cadres act as teachers, giving lectures in connection with reality, effectively improving the cadres' theoretical level. Some basic-level cadres in Zhuanqiang Commune used to think that there was a contradiction between grasping production and grasping life. After studying Chairman Mao's article "Pay Attention to the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods," they clarified the dialectical relationship between the two, and established a system in which special personnel are responsible for production and life, and working methods of going to the fields to grasp production and grasping the canteen at meals, which has yielded good results. Fourth, through the "Three Helps," the advanced are promoted to be more advanced, and the backward are catching up with the advanced. After the county and commune-level cadres went deep down, they focused on advanced teams on one hand and backward teams on the other, with the emphasis on backward teams. They prescribed the right medicine according to the situation of each team, and gave specific help, so that the production and construction of the poor teams have generally made significant progress. At present, 15 backward teams in the county (accounting for 40% of the entire backward teams) have caught up with the advanced teams. Fifth, through the "Three Helps," the relationship between superiors and subordinates and between cadres and the masses has become closer. They become teachers and students to each other, becoming intimate friends. (Attached picture)
    Guo Faguai (first from the left, Han nationality), the first secretary of the Yesong Commune Party Committee in Wangmo County, Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou Province, has persisted in going deep into production, deep into the masses, and practicing the "Four Togethers" with the commune members for ten years as if it were one day. In his work, he pays attention to helping minority cadres improve their theoretical and leadership levels. This is him studying theory together with the cadres and activists of the second production team of the Songshan Management Area.

    帮助基层干部改进思想作风、解决实际困难和安排社员生活
  　高淳县社干部开展“三帮”活动
    本报讯　中共高淳县委通讯组报道：江苏省高淳县县社两级深入生产队的干部，在和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量的基础上，开展帮助生产队干部改进思想作风、解决实际困难、安排社员生活的“三帮”活动。
    帮助生产队干部改进思想作风，主要是运用学、带、比、谈、干等方法。“学”，一方面帮助基层干部学习毛泽东著作和党的方针、政策，提高他们对实际问题的分析能力；一方面又学习和总结基层干部作好工作，管好生产、生活的实际工作经验和生产技术。“带”，通过层层带徒弟，提高基层干部的领导水平。“比”，随时随地插红旗，树标兵，鼓干劲。“谈”，以推心置腹的精神，和队干部、社员谈心交心，做他们的知心朋友，使自己有千只眼万只耳，及时发现问题解决问题。“干”，以自己的模范行动做出样子，鼓舞和启发生产队干部。
    在帮助生产队干部解决实际困难问题方面，采取的办法是：鼓、挖、安、开、支。“鼓”，对生产上有实际困难的生产队和大队，首先给他们鼓劲，帮助他们树立雄心大志。“挖”，根据生产队的实际困难，帮助他们在人力、物力、财力上充分挖掘潜力，解决困难。“安”，帮助困难队认真作好安排，制订计划。“开”，帮助困难队开源节流，因地制宜地开辟生产门路，不断增加收入，同时注意节省非生产开支。“支”，组织队与队之间，在等价交换的前提下，开展共产主义协作。
    帮助生产队干部安排社员生活，主要是通过参、办、建、管、训等办法。“参”，县、社干部下去后，一定要参加公共食堂吃饭，而且一般要到办得较差的食堂去吃饭，以便及时发现问题，解决问题。“办”，每人帮助办好一个标兵食堂，取得经验后，及时推广。“建”，帮助所有食堂建立家底，做到瓜菜满园，六畜成群，饭菜多样。“管”，以管好用好粮食为中心，建立各种民主管理制度。“训”，帮助培训会计和炊事员，不断提高他们的技术水平和管理能力。
    “三帮”活动，最早开始于这个县的凤山公社。这个公社从直属单位中抽调四十三名干部深入到生产队，开展“三帮”以后，使原来工作处于后进的五个大队及三十四个生产队，迅速赶上了先进，成了全县的红旗单位。高淳县委在召开有公社党委第一书记参加的县委扩大会议上，推广了凤山公社“三帮”的经验。同时从县、公社抽调了五百九十三名干部，深入到大队、生产队开展“三帮”活动。实践证明，组织县社两级干部深入基层进行“三帮”，有五个好处：第一，给县、社干部深入生产第一线，坚持“四同”，提出了明确的目的与要求，加强了干部的责任感。以县级机关为例，过去抽调下乡的五十二名科局长以上干部，有一半左右的同志仍然在家忙事务，不能经常深入下去。在开展“三帮”以后，他们有的包片，有的定队，吃饭在食堂，工作在田头，切切实实帮助队干部解决具体问题。第二，通过“三帮”，促使干部深入下去，既动手，又动脑，工作作风越来越踏实细致。突出的表现在：走马看花的少了，下马落户、参加生产、出主意、想办法，帮助解决问题的多了；无准备的会议减少了，有计划地讨论处理问题的多了。东坝公社原来工作缺乏统筹安排，经常把公社、大队干部调上来开会。开展“三帮”后，全社划成五个片，由公社党委常委负责，其他十九名社干部，统统定到队，规定开大会到田，公社开会到片，保证了干部踏踏实实地参加生产领导生产。第三，由于“三帮”活动的开展，提高了大队和生产队干部的政治思想水平和领导能力，进一步改进了作风。固城、砖墙两个公社，为了帮助队干部提高理论政策水平，分片办起了二十多所业余党校。由县、社干部当教员，联系实际进行讲课，有效地提高了干部的理论水平。砖墙公社有些基层干部，过去认为抓生产与抓生活有矛盾，学习了毛主席的“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”一文后，弄清了两者的辩证关系，确定了生产、生活有专人负责的制度，和下田抓生产、吃饭抓食堂的工作方法，效果很好。第四，通过“三帮”，促使先进更先进，后进赶先进。县社两级干部深入以后，一手抓先进队，一手抓后进队，重点又放在后进队。他们根据各队情况，对症下药，具体帮助，使穷队的生产建设，一般都有显著发展。目前全县已有十五个后进队（占整个后进队的40％），赶上了先进队。第五，通过“三帮”，上级与下级，干部与群众的关系更加密切了。他们互当先生，互为学生，成了知心朋友。（附图片）
