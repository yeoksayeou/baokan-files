Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 2nd: TASS reported from New York on August 1st: The Acting Permanent Representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations, Morozov, met with the Chairman of the United Nations Disarmament Committee, Luis Padilla Nervo, yesterday regarding the suggestion by the United States Representative to the United Nations to convene a meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Committee, and delivered a letter from the Soviet government to him.

    The letter stated that the Soviet government first drew attention to the fact that in the letter from the Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations requesting a meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Committee, the true facts that led to the breakdown of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting were distorted, in an attempt to defend the position held by the United States government in the negotiation process.

    Throughout the negotiations, the Western countries in the Ten-Nation Committee did not lead the matter towards the formulation of a disarmament treaty, but instead engaged in futile arguments, which clearly showed that they did not wish to seriously discuss practical measures for disarmament.

    The Ten-Nation Committee was used as a cover for the arms race being carried out by the United States and its partners in its military bloc. Given the position held by the United States and other Western countries in the Ten-Nation Committee, the Ten-Nation Committee was unable to reach an agreement on any issue related to disarmament. It was precisely for this reason that the Soviet government ceased its participation in the work of the committee and submitted the disarmament issue to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion.

    The letter pointed out that the United States government's suggestion to convene a meeting of the Disarmament Committee was clearly a maneuver, stemming from temporary considerations related to the domestic situation in the United States. The United States government wants to convene a committee meeting, not to make progress in resolving the disarmament issue, but to mask its unwillingness to reach an agreement on this issue.

    The Soviet government believes that under the current conditions, convening the Disarmament Committee on the eve of the United Nations General Assembly meeting, which has an obligation to comprehensively discuss the issue of disarmament, can only exacerbate the situation and hinder effective discussion of this most important issue at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly meeting.

    For the above reasons, the Soviet government believes that it is not appropriate to convene the United Nations Disarmament Committee at this time and opposes the convening of this meeting.

    The letter stated that the essence of the differences between socialist countries and Western countries on the issue of disarmament is so serious that this issue must be discussed in the United Nations General Assembly, and a broad and comprehensive discussion must be held. The letter also pointed out that the Soviet government believes that the direct participation of the heads of government of United Nations member states in the General Assembly's discussion of the disarmament issue is most in line with this objective.

    苏联政府致函联合国裁军委员会主席
    揭露美国歪曲事实真相
    指出美国建议召开裁军委员会会议是玩弄手腕  目的是为了掩饰它不愿意达成裁军协议的企图
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社纽约1日讯：苏联驻联合国代理常任代表莫罗佐夫昨天就美国驻联合国代表建议召开联合国裁军委员会会议一事，会晤了联合国裁军委员会主席路易斯·帕迪利亚·内尔沃，并代表苏联政府交给他一封信。
    信中说，苏联政府首先提请注意，在美国驻联合国常任代表要求召开联合国裁军委员会会议的信中，歪曲了导致十国裁军委员会会议破裂的事实的真象，企图为美国政府在谈判过程中所持的立场辩护。
    十国委员会中的西方国家在整个谈判期间不是把事情引向拟定裁军条约，而是一味进行无益的争论，这十分清楚地表明，它们不希望认真讨论裁军的实际措施。
    十国委员会被用来作为掩盖美国以及它的军事集团的伙伴进行军备竞赛的幌子。鉴于十国委员会中的美国和其他西方国家所持的立场，十国委员会已无法就任何一个有关裁军的问题达成协议。正是由于这个原因，苏联政府才停止参加委员会的工作，并且把裁军问题提交联合国大会讨论。
    信中指出，美国政府建议召开裁军委员会会议显然是玩弄手腕，这是出于同美国国内局势有关的暂时的考虑。美国政府要召开委员会会议，不是为了使裁军问题的解决有所进展，而是为了掩饰它不愿就这个问题达成协议的企图。
    苏联政府认为，在目前条件下，在有义务全面讨论裁军问题的联合国大会会议前夕召开裁军委员会只能加剧局势，妨碍在即将召开的联合国大会会议上有效地讨论这个最重要的问题。
    由于上述原因，苏联政府认为，在目前召开联合国裁军委员会是不适宜的，并且反对召开这次会议。
    信中说，社会主义国家和西方国家在裁军问题上的分歧的实质是十分严重的，以致这个问题必须在联合国大会上来讨论，而且要进行广泛的和全面的讨论。信中还指出，苏联政府认为，联合国会员国政府首脑直接参加大会讨论裁军问题是最符合这一目的的。
