    Stepping Up Preparations for Military Intervention in Cuba
    U.S. Military Gathers in the Caribbean
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 25th: The United States military is gathering in the Caribbean region, ready to launch a military intervention in Cuba at any time. According to a report in the Cuban "Revolución" newspaper on the 24th, the U.S. government has ordered its forces in and near the Caribbean region to be prepared to fulfill any intervention requests made by the Organization of American States. Diplomatic sources say that a member of the Pentagon confirmed that U.S. Army paratrooper units and Air Force aircraft have been dispatched to locations not far from the Caribbean region. It is reported that under the guise of so-called "routine exercises," these units from the 2nd Battalion of the 6th Regiment and a unit from the 2nd Division from Camp Lejeune in North Carolina have arrived on Vieques Island, Puerto Rico. According to the Pentagon, the U.S. side had postponed these exercises in order to "avoid accusations of a U.S. show of force in the Caribbean region during the OAS foreign ministers' meeting.”
    It is reported that all U.S. military commanders stationed abroad, including the heads of military bases in the Caribbean region, held a meeting at the Pentagon last week. This extraordinary meeting was held after Eisenhower announced "increased military preparedness."

    加紧准备对古巴发动军事干涉
    美军向加勒比地区集结
    新华社哈瓦那25日电　美国军队正在向加勒比地区集结，随时准备对古巴发动军事干涉。据古巴“革命报”24日报道，美国政府已经下令它的加勒比地区和附近的部队准备履行美洲国家组织提出的任何干涉要求。从外交方面获得的消息说，五角大楼的一个成员证实，美国陆军伞兵部队和空军部队的飞机已经被派遣到离加勒比地区不远的地方。据报道，在进行所谓“常规演习”的幌子下，来自美国北卡罗来纳州莱琴兵营的第六军团第二大队的这些部队和第二师的一支部队已经抵达波多黎各的别克斯岛。据五角大楼说，美国方面曾推迟了这些演习，为的是“逃避在美洲国家组织外长会议期间人们可能对美国提出的在加勒比地区显示武力的指控”。
    据报道，所有美国驻在外国的军队司令，其中包括加勒比地区军事基地的首脑，上星期在五角大楼举行了会议。这次非常会议是在艾森豪威尔宣布“加强军事准备”之后举行的。
