Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, August 22nd: Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk, in a letter to the Khmer people published in the weekly "Nationalist" on the 21st, refuted the slanders spread by the Western press regarding the so-called "unease among the Khmer people" about the Laotian coup. He also pointed out, "Attempts to incorporate Laos into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, attempts to run counter to the tide of history and the profound aspirations of the Laotian people, as well as the trend towards neutrality, non-alignment, and peaceful coexistence, are all futile."

Sihanouk wrote, "I really cannot imagine why the Khmer people and their government should feel uneasy because the Laotian people and soldiers have overthrown a government that was leading Laos down a path similar to that taken by Son Ngoc Thanh and Sananikone. If the Kingdom of Laos can truly 'abandon the policies advocated by Son Ngoc Thanh and adopt a strict neutral policy like that pursued by our People's Socialist Community,' I would truly feel 'pleased'."

Sihanouk pointed out that the malicious actions taken by certain countries in the "free world" against Cambodia also included "instigating Phoumi Nosavan to take action against Khmer neutrality."

He said, "People are trying to surround us, suffocate us, and destroy our independence and our People's Socialist Community at any cost."

    西哈努克在驳斥西方报界的谰言时说
    老挝奉行中立政策将使柬埔寨高兴
    新华社金边22日电　柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王在21日出版的“民族主义者”周刊上发表的致高棉人民书中，驳斥了西方报界就老挝政变所散布的所谓“高棉人士的不安”的谰言。他还指出，“企图把老挝纳入东南亚条约组织，企图同历史潮流和老挝人民的深刻愿望以及中立、不参加集团和和平共处的趋势背道而驰，都是徒劳无益的。”
    西哈努克写道，“我真不能设想，老挝人民和士兵推翻了把老挝带上类似山玉成和桑·萨里所走的道路的政府，高棉人民及其政府为什么要为此感到不安呢？ 要是老挝王国真正能“抛弃山玉成所主张的政策，而采取像我们的人民社会同盟所奉行的严格中立政策”，我就会真正感到“高兴”。
    西哈努克指出，“自由世界”的某些国家对柬埔寨所采取的恶毒行动中，还包括“促使富米·诺萨万采取行动反对高棉的中立”。
    他说，“人们企图包围我们、窒息我们、不惜代价来摧毁我们的独立和我们的人民社会同盟”。
