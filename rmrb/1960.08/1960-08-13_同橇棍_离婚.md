    “Divorcing” the Crowbar
    For thirty years, the steel rolling workers of the First Medium Plate Mill of Anshan Iron and Steel have wrestled with steel slabs over a thousand degrees Celsius using crowbars. Recently, a new scene of using a "steel straightening machine" to replace crowbars has appeared in this factory. The steel rolling workers jokingly said: "We have divorced the crowbar."
    Where did the "steel straightening machine" come from? There is an old fitter in this factory named Chen Libo. Every time he went to the rolling mill to do repairs, he would see four rolling workers holding heavy crowbars, standing at the four corners of the fiery red, crooked steel slab, prying it back and forth with the crowbars until the steel slab was straightened and could enter the rolling mill to be rolled into steel plate. The heat radiating from the steel slab would soak the workers in sweat. Chen Libo kept thinking in his heart: "If there were a machine to replace the crowbar, it would be great, as it would reduce heavy physical labor, increase the production of high-quality steel, and achieve safe production."
    He ran to the electromechanical section to find the fitter team leader Zhao Zhenguo and the fitter Xie Guoyin, to discuss his plans. They said happily: "Let's study it together!" That night, the three of them stayed at the factory to think, discuss, draw, and study the "steel straightening machine" model. Seven days later, the "steel straightening machine" model and drawings finally came out. Then, the machinists, riveters, and fitters of the electromechanical section all started to work, looking for scrap materials, piecing together parts, and in another seven days, they installed the "steel straightening machine" next to the rolling mill.
    The "steel straightening machine" started its trial. The rolling workers sat at the console with joy, lightly moving the switch. One fiery red steel slab after another flew out of the soaking pit and ran to the side of the rolling mill. At this time, the two large clamps on the "steel straightening machine" pressed tightly together, clamped the steel slab, found a good angle, and sent it into the rolling mill. Sparks flew everywhere, and the sound was like thunder, and in a few moments, the steel slab was rolled into a steel plate.
    With the "steel straightening machine," the working conditions of the rolling workers have been further improved, and production has also taken a step forward. It only takes one minute and twenty seconds to roll a steel plate, which is ten seconds shorter than before. From then on, the First Medium Plate Mill added another wing in the great leap forward in production.

### 同橇棍“离婚”

    同橇棍“离婚”
    橇棍，鞍钢第一中板厂的轧钢工人整整用它同千度以上的钢板坯搏斗了三十年。最近，这个厂出现了用“蹩钢机”代替橇棍的新景象。轧钢工人诙谐地说：“咱们同橇棍离婚了。”
    “蹩钢机”哪儿来的？这个厂有个老钳工，名叫陈立波。当他每次到轧钢车间检修时，就会看到四名轧钢工人手持笨重的橇棍，站在火红的歪斜不正的钢坯四角，用橇棍蹩来蹩去，直到把钢坯蹩正，能进轧钢机轧出钢板为止。钢坯散发的热力，烤得人浑身水淋淋的。陈立波心里不断地在想：“若有一种机器代替橇棍多好呀，既能减轻笨重的体力劳动，又能增产优质钢材，达到安全生产。”
    他跑到机电工段去找钳工组长赵振国和钳工谢国印，商讨他的打算。他俩满高兴地说：“咱们一起研究吧！”当天晚上，三个人就留在厂子里一块儿想呀，议呀，画呀，研究“蹩钢机”模型。七天以后，“蹩钢机”模型和图纸到底出来了。接着，机电工段的车工、铆工、钳工一齐动手，找废料，凑零件，又用七天时间就把“蹩钢机”安装在轧钢机旁。
    “蹩钢机”开始试验了。轧钢工人满腹喜悦坐在操纵台上，轻轻地搬动着电闸，一块块火红的钢板坯飞出均热炉，跑到轧钢机边。这时，“蹩钢机”上的两个大钳子互相靠紧，夹住钢坯，找好角度，送进轧钢机。顿时火花四射，响声如雷，几下子就把钢坯轧成了钢板。
    有了“蹩钢机”，轧钢工人的劳动条件进一步改善了，生产也跨进了一步，一分二十秒钟就能轧出一块钢板，比过去缩短了十秒钟。从此，第一中板厂在生产跃进中又增添了一只翅膀。
