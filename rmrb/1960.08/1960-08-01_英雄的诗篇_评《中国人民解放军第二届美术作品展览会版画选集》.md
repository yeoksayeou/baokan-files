    A Poem of Heroes
    ——Review of "Selected Prints from the Second Art Exhibition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" Yang Han
    The recently published "Selected Prints from the Second Art Exhibition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," is a good album worthy of recommendation to readers, whether from the perspective of content and form, or ideological and artistic quality. This album is a concrete manifestation of the high political and cultural qualities of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army; an artistic reflection of the fighting life and fine traditions of the people's army; and also a poem carved with iron pens by the soldiers taught by Chairman Mao, who are loyal to the motherland, loyal to the people, and loyal to the great cause of socialism and communism.
    Turning to the first page, we see the color woodcut "On Duty" by student Kang Fenggui. The author succinctly shapes the image of a simple and handsome PLA soldier. Through a large red lantern and the Tiananmen Square in the background through the garden gate, we deeply understand that when the masses are boiling and celebrating the great festival of the motherland, the people's army is strictly performing its sacred duties. This painting is like the general outline of the entire album, pointing out the essence of the Chinese People's Liberation Army as a people's army that defends the motherland, defends the people, and defends the interests of socialism.
    The second piece, "Rising Sun" co-authored by Sergeant Jia Deyi, Du Guoxian, He Mingqi, and Hua Yongjiu, symbolizes the unparalleled vitality of our People's Liberation Army. A red sun rises on the eastern sea, and a warship carries out its mission from night to dawn. When the sun rises, the sea is calm, and the ship sails slowly. The ripples of the ocean and the reflection of the red sun give a fresh and energetic impression. This is an overture to the entire album.
    Then the heroic symphony begins: training, defending the coast, border, internal defense, military-civilian relations, officer-soldier relations, cultural and sports life, and actively participating in socialist production and construction.... It ends with "Celebrating the Harvest."
    The one hundred and twenty works included in this album are extremely rich and colorful, from the subject matter to the form of expression, and the style.
    The works on the theme of defending the coast reflect the brave fighting spirit of the soldiers and the magnificent beauty of the motherland's ocean. Whether it is the hero driving a torpedo boat, or the warrior patrolling the rugged rocks at night, or the signalman guarding the outpost day and night, or the martyr who dedicated his precious life to the motherland... all show a firm, brave, and unyielding heroic spirit. These images give people unparalleled confidence. The fighting life on the coastal defense line is arduous and glorious. The magnificent ocean of the motherland adds to the optimistic mood. Many authors' works convey this strong ideological feeling.
    The fighting life of the heroes defending the border is also solemn and rich. The plateau with perennial snow, the peaks towering into the clouds, and the charming primitive forests set off the heroic posture of the heroes and the galloping warhorses. They discovered traces of the enemy, galloped across the grassland, jumped over cliffs, and pursued the enemy. After a battle, they tied the captives to their horses or carried them on sleds, and returned victoriously on the snowy road. The excited and relaxed movements are contrasted with the cold tones of the plateau, which is very beautiful and harmonious. Many works have fully expressed this.
    The three works depicting signal soldiers and motorcycle soldiers each have their own characteristics. Some express the theme from the image of the characters, and some from the surrounding environment, while Second Lieutenant Zhao Jimin's "Signal Soldier" makes a clever and bold expression. The author used bold strokes to carve the trees by the road, which were bent and tilted by the wind and had elasticity, making the motorcycle fly, as if the branches were brushing past the ears, advancing like an arrow, making people feel that the signal soldier is performing a very urgent communication task.
    We can also see the magnificent scene of the Chinese People's Liberation Army participating in socialist construction from works such as "Road-Building Soldiers" (by projectionist Guo Ximin) and "Blocking the Flood" (by Kang Fenggui). From the works of comrades Liao Youkai, Chao Mei, and Zuo Liang, we see the soldiers "Marching into the Great Northern Wilderness" turning the desolate prairie into a "golden ocean." We can also see the military-civilian relations where the army and the people are as close as fish and water, the united officer-soldier relations, and the image of the general appearing in the posture of the working people.
    All these lives with great significance are themselves magnificent and beautiful poems. Through vivid lines, bright colors, and bold brushwork, we see the noble qualities inherent in the people's army, the artistic wit and courage of the professional and amateur authors of the troops, and the tremendous development of the troops' art with revolutionary fighting traditions along the direction of serving the soldiers. These works present a new atmosphere of letting a hundred flowers bloom, which are bright flowers blooming under the shining of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought.

    英雄的诗篇
    ——评《中国人民解放军第二届美术作品展览会版画选集》	杨涵
    最近出版的《中国人民解放军第二届美术作品展览会版画选集》，不论从内容和形式、思想性和艺术性方面来看，都是值得向读者推荐的一本好画册。这本画册是英雄的中国人民解放军具有高度政治素养和文化素养的具体表现；是人民军队的战斗生活和优良传统在艺术上的反映；也是忠于祖国、忠于人民、忠于社会主义、共产主义伟大事业的毛主席教导出来的战士们，用铁笔刻划出来的诗篇。
    翻开第一页，是学员康凤桂的套色木刻《在岗位上》。作者简练地塑造了一个朴实而英俊的解放军战士的形象。通过一只大红灯笼和透过园门的背景天安门广场，使我们深切地理解到，当万众沸腾欢庆祖国伟大节日的时候，人民的军队严格执行着神圣的职责。这幅画犹如整本画册的总纲，点出了中国人民解放军是保卫祖国、保卫人民、保卫社会主义利益的人民军队的本质。
    第二幅是下士贾德义、杜国贤、贺明齐、华永久合作的《旭日东升》，象征着我国人民解放军无比强大的生命力。一轮红日，在东方的海面升起，一艘军舰，从黑夜到黎明，执行着自己的使命。当太阳升起的时候，风平浪静，缓缓驶行。海洋的微波，红日的倒影，给人以清新而富有朝气的印象。这是整本画册的一首序曲。
    接着英雄的交响曲开始了：练兵、保卫海防、边防、内防、军民关系、官兵关系、文娱体育生活以及积极参加社会主义生产建设……。最后以《庆丰收》为结束。
    收在这本画册里的一百二十幅作品，从题材内容到表现形式，以及风格，都是极其丰富多彩的。
    在保卫海防为题材的作品中，反映了战士们英勇的战斗精神和祖国海洋的壮阔美丽。不论是驾驶着鱼雷快艇的英雄，或深夜巡逻在峥嵘礁石上的勇士，也不论是日夜守卫在前哨阵地的通讯兵，或为祖国献出可贵生命的烈士……都表现了坚定勇敢、顽强不屈的英雄气概。这些形象给人以无比的信心。海防线上的战斗生活，是艰苦的也是十分光荣的。祖国壮丽的海洋，使人增添了乐观主义的情绪。许多作者的作品都传达了这种强烈的思想感情。
    保卫在边防线上的英雄们的战斗生活，也是庄严而丰富的，那长年积雪的高原，耸入云霄的峰尖，富于魅力的原始森林，衬托着英雄的英姿和那奔腾的战马，他们发现了敌人的踪迹，驰过草原，跃过悬崖，追击着敌人。经过一场战斗之后，把俘虏绑在马上，或载在雪橇上，踏着积雪的道路，胜利而归，那兴奋而又轻松的动态和一片高原寒冷的色调相对比，非常美丽，非常和谐。不少作品对此都有充分的表现。
    描写通讯兵、摩托兵的三幅作品，各有自己的特色。有从人物形象，有从周围环境来表达主题思想，而少尉赵辑民的《通讯兵》更作了巧妙而大胆的表现。作者以大刀阔斧的刀法，刻划了被风吹得弓腰倾斜而有弹性的道旁的树，使摩托车飞跑起来，有如树枝从耳边撩过，箭一般的前进，使人感觉到通讯兵正在执行着万分火急的通讯任务。
    我们还可以从《筑路的战士》（放映员郭西民作）和《挡住洪流》（康凤桂作）等作品，看到了中国人民解放军参加社会主义建设的宏伟场面。从廖有楷、晁楣、作良等同志的作品里，看到了《向北大荒进军》的战士们，把荒无人烟的草原变成《黄金色的海洋》。我们还可以看到鱼水相融的军民关系、团结一致的官兵关系和以劳动人民姿态出现的将军的形象。
    所有这些富有伟大意义的生活本身，就是壮丽而美妙的诗篇。透过生动的线条，鲜明的色彩和奔放刀法，使我们看到人民军队内在的高贵品质，看到了部队专业和业余作者在艺术表现上的机智和勇敢，看到了具有革命战斗传统的部队美术沿着为兵服务的方向所取得的巨大发展。这些作品，呈现出了一片百花齐放的新气象，这是在毛主席文艺思想的光辉照耀下开放出来的鲜艳的花朵。
