    In Santander, a shipyard laid off 225 workers, a tannery laid off 90 workers, and a rayon factory is preparing to lay off 216 workers.

    In the Basque region, an electrical equipment factory is only operating three days a week, which has significantly reduced the wages and family allowances of 500 workers (the amount of family allowance depends on the length of working hours).

    西班牙失业人数日益增多
    新华社巴黎17日电　巴黎“回声报”报道，西班牙的失业人数日益增多，许多工厂最近大批解雇工人。
    在桑坦德尔，一家造船厂解雇了二百二十五名工人、一家制革厂解雇了九十名工人、一家人造丝制造厂准备解雇二百一十六名工人。
    在巴斯凯，一家电气装备厂一周只开工三天，因而使五百名工人的工资和家属补助金大大降低（家属补助金的多少取决于工作时间的长短）。
    在瓦棱西亚，在造纸、家具、造船、建筑等许多企业中，失业情况严重。在阿斯都里亚，一家工厂宣布要解雇二百工人，另一家工厂已经解雇八十六名工人。
