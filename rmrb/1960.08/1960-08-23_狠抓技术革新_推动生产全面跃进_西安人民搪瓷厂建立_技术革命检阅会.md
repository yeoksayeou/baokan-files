Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 22nd: In the technical revolution movement, the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory established and adhered to a bi-monthly "Technical Revolution Review Meeting" system, prompting the factory's technical innovation movement to deepen step by step, and various production activities to continue to leap forward. Now, this factory has achieved this year's technical revolution plan ahead of schedule, and the entire factory has shifted from mostly manual production to mostly mechanical production. Since the establishment of this review system in February this year, the entire factory's production has been "red" every month. Up to now, it has completed 80% of the annual production plan, and at the same time saved more than 300 workers. The quality of products has been continuously improved, and 85 new products and more than 300 new patterns have been added.

The "Technical Revolution Review Meeting" of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory is a comprehensive development based on mass production competition forms such as mobilization rallies, festival gifts, technical performance competitions, and production sports meetings. Since February this year, they have held a "Technical Revolution Review Meeting" on the 1st and 15th of each month. The central content of this review meeting is to check the completion of production tasks and technical innovation projects since the last review meeting, and at the same time arrange the production plan for the next stage and the technical innovation projects combined with the production plan. The specific activities of each review meeting are "arrange, attack, summarize, practice, reform, evaluate, review." "Arrange" means arranging key production points and arranging innovation projects. "Attack" means organizing technical forces to surround and attack the arranged projects. "Summarize" means conducting technical appraisal, summarizing, and promoting. "Practice" means practicing and mastering new technologies and new tools. "Reform" means improving production management. "Evaluate" means evaluating and rewarding. "Review" means reviewing the actual production effects.

Regularly holding "Technical Revolution Review Meetings," and closely combining the technical revolution movement with current production, has not only effectively promoted the factory's production development, but also continuously deepened the technical revolution movement, and constantly promoted, consolidated, and improved innovative results. Taking the eleventh review meeting held in the first half of August as an example, this meeting reviewed 21 innovation projects based on the key production points raised at the previous meeting. For example, the indigenous pulverized coal injection machine that participated in this review was an important innovative creation by the workers in response to the factory's insufficient furnace temperature after switching to burning inferior coal. Using this equipment, without rebuilding the existing furnace, inferior coal can be crushed into pulverized coal and burned using indigenous methods, which not only increases the furnace temperature from less than 600 degrees Celsius at the beginning to about 1,000 degrees, but also saves 40% of coal. Nine of the innovation projects reviewed at this review meeting belonged to improving, consolidating, and promoting the innovative achievements of the factory and other factories. For example, the dry method of enamel coating for industrial enamel was a project that had been successfully tested by learning from Shanghai's experience and at the last review meeting, but it had not yet been used in production. After that review meeting, the industrial enamel workshop concentrated its efforts on solving a series of problems such as the tools and operating procedures for dry enamel coating, and since July 23, it has begun to replace the wet method with the dry method for enamel coating on evaporator pot products, increasing the shift output of evaporator pots from three to four in the past to about 30, completing the production task of more than 200 evaporator pots in just seven days. Many innovation projects have been improved step by step through repeated review meetings. For example, the cup coating machine has been improved 18 times, and the washbasin coating machine has been improved 22 times. Now the coating machine has developed from only being able to coat the bottom powder and washbasins in the past to coating cover powder and miscellaneous parts. More than 85% of the factory's more than 200 major innovation projects have been promoted, consolidated, and improved through reviews.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the review meeting, the factory party committee secretary personally led a evaluation and review team composed of party, government, labor union, youth league and workshop leaders to conduct a roving review and accept key innovation projects item by item at each meeting. The review team, led by the red flag and accompanied by gongs and drums, presented congratulatory posters to advanced units and individuals on the spot by the party committee secretary and factory director, and issued innovation acceptance certificates. All employees also organized observation and study groups by workshop to visit and learn from each other and exchange experiences. After the review, a factory-wide employee meeting was held, at which each unit reported on its achievements, summarized its experience, evaluated and rewarded, and selected red flag bearers, while announcing the tasks for the next stage, expressing determination, and making guarantees. In this way, each review meeting simultaneously functions as a work inspection meeting, a production competition meeting, an evaluation and reward meeting, an experience exchange meeting, and a mobilization rally, effectively promoting the further development of the mass movement.

### 狠抓技术革新　推动生产全面跃进  西安人民搪瓷厂建立“技术革命检阅会”

    狠抓技术革新　推动生产全面跃进
    西安人民搪瓷厂建立“技术革命检阅会”
    新华社西安22日电　西安人民搪瓷厂在技术革命运动中，建立和坚持每半月一次的“技术革命检阅会”制度，促使全厂技术革新运动步步深入，各项生产持续跃进。现在，这个工厂已经提前实现了今年全年的技术革命规划，全厂已经由原来大部分用手工生产改为大部分用机械生产。全厂从今年2月建立这一检阅制度以来，生产作到了月月红，到目前为止，已经完成全年生产计划的80％，同时节约出了三百多名工人；产品质量不断提高，并且增加了八十五种新产品和三百多种新花样。
    西安人民搪瓷厂的“技术革命检阅会”，是在誓师动员、节日献礼、技术表演赛、生产运动会等群众性的生产竞赛形式的基础上，综合发展起来的。他们从今年2月以来，每逢1日、15日都举行一次“技术革命检阅会”。这种检阅会的中心内容是检查上次检阅会以来的生产任务和技术革新项目完成情况，同时安排下一阶段的生产计划以及与生产计划相结合的技术革新项目。每次检阅会的具体活动是“排、攻、总、练、改、评、阅”，“排”是排列生产关键，安排革新项目；“攻”是组织技术力量，围攻排定的项目；“总”是进行技术鉴定，总结推广；“练”是练习掌握新技术、新工具；“改”是改进生产管理；“评”是评比奖励；“阅”是检阅生产实际效果。
    定期举行“技术革命检阅会”，把技术革命运动同当前生产紧密结合起来，不仅有效地促进了这个工厂的生产发展，同时也使技术革命运动不断深化，革新成果不断获得推广、巩固和提高。以8月上半月举行的第十一次检阅会为例，这次会议根据上次会议提出的生产关键检阅了二十一项革新项目。如参加这次检阅的土喷煤粉机，就是职工们针对厂内改烧劣质煤后炉温不够高的情况进行的一项重要革新创造。使用这种设备，在不改建现有炉子的前提下，可以把劣质煤碾成煤粉用土法燃烧，不仅将炉温由开始不到摄氏六百度提高到千度左右，同时可以节约40％的煤炭。在这次检阅会上检查的革新项目，还有九项是属于提高、巩固、推广本厂和外厂革新成果的。像工业搪瓷的干法上釉是学习上海经验、在上次检阅会时已经试验成功的项目，但是当时还没有用到生产上；那次检阅会后，工业搪瓷车间就集中力量解决干法上釉的工具、操作规程等一系列问题，自7月23日起就在蒸发锅产品上开始以干法代替湿法上釉，使蒸发锅的班产量由过去的三到四个提高到三十个左右，仅以七天时间就完成了二百多台蒸发锅的生产任务。许多革新项目，通过一次又一次的检阅会步步改进提高。如口杯涂琅机已经改进了十八次，面盆涂琅机改进了二十二次。现在涂琅机已经由过去只能搪底粉、搪面盆发展到搪罩粉、搪杂件，全厂二百多项重大革新项目，85％以上通过检阅得到推广、巩固和提高。
    为了加强对检阅会的领导，每次开会厂党委书记都亲自率领由党、政、工、团和车间负责干部组成的评比检阅团，巡回检阅，逐项验收重点革新项目。检阅团以红旗为前导，锣鼓喧天，党委书记、厂长当场为先进单位和个人送祝贺表扬的大字报，签发革新验收证。全体职工也以车间为单位组织观摩学习团，相互参观学习，交流经验。检阅后举行全厂职工大会，由各个单位汇报成绩，总结经验，评比奖励，选拔红旗手，同时宣布下一阶段的任务，表决心、提保证。这样就使每次检阅会同时起着工作检查会、生产竞赛会、评比奖励会、经验交流会、誓师动员会等多种功能，有效地推动了群众运动的进一步发展。
