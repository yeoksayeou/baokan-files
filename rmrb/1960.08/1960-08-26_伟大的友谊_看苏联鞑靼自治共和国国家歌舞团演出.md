Great Friendship
——Watching the Performance of the Soviet Tatar Autonomous Republic National Song and Dance Ensemble
	Lü Ji (text), Ye Qianyu (sketches)

	Every nation's art has its own unique brilliance. Although this unique brilliance is not life itself, but merely life reflected through artistic forms, we often use this distinctive brilliance to gain a deeper understanding of the people's lives, history, and aesthetic views of that nation. This idea, though not born from watching the performance of the Soviet Tatar Autonomous Republic National Song and Dance Ensemble, was reinforced in my mind by watching their performance.

	My understanding of the life and song and dance art of the people of the Soviet Tatar Autonomous Republic was limited due to lack of prior contact. However, while watching their performance recently, we did not feel unfamiliar at all. From a musical perspective, what made us feel familiar was, first and foremost, their pentatonic scale, which is completely identical to ours, and the musical language built upon it. Of course, these are only formal elements. More importantly, it is the content. The music expresses the simple life emotions of the Tatar people, a component of the Soviet people, especially their odes to the new life, full of happiness and joy, sung during the socialist construction. Although we did not understand the language of the lyrics at all, after hearing the gist of the translation, we not only felt completely able to understand but also felt very close to them.

	Nasretdinov's song "To Chinese Friends" particularly stirred our hearts. In this short choral piece, composer Faiz effectively expressed the profound friendship of the working people of the Tatar Autonomous Republic towards our people with extremely lyrical melodies and very simple yet colorful harmonies. The warm tones, stirring verses, and emotionally rich and outstanding performance embraced the entire audience. Indeed, our emotions were completely integrated with the song of friendship. We completely felt that the people of Kazan, an ancient city separated by vast distances, were sitting with us heart to heart. After listening to the greetings of the singers to their comrades, we could not help but respond with the warmest applause. This was naturally not only applause for the creative labor of the composer and singers, but also applause for all the working people of the Tatar Autonomous Republic, for all the nationalities of the Soviet Union, and for the further development of the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union.

	In this performance by the Tatar Song and Dance Ensemble, we also heard the choral song "My Republic" by the well-known Tatar composer Zhiganov, which we were familiar with. From this choral piece, we heard that the Tatar people live a peaceful and happy life in the great socialist family of the Soviet Union, and we also heard their passionate praise of the socialist motherland. In addition, we also heard some songs reflecting Soviet socialist and communist construction, such as "Lights on the Kama River," "New Kazan," "Song of the Pavlin Oil Workers," and "Song of the Siberian Youth." With unparalleled deep friendship, the choir sang "The East is Red" in Chinese, a song praising our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong. All the choir members completely overcame the difficulty of pronouncing the Chinese words clearly, excellently grasped the characteristics of the Chinese language and Chinese songs, and expressed their extremely sincere feelings, thus winning the warmest response from the entire audience.

	Everyone could hear that, whether it was modern compositions or adapted Tatar folk songs, whether it was song and dance music or dance accompaniment, the authors all selected appropriate forms and skillfully processed the materials that were most characteristic of the nation. In the chorus, the effective use of each voice part, the responses between solo and chorus, were all very natural and artistically effective, without appearing bulky or piled up. In the dance accompaniment music, although sometimes there were only two accordions and the melody changes were not complex, they set off those dances, which were full of humor and lively rhythms, very vividly. Although the entire accompanying orchestra had only nine people, all the accompaniment appeared very full and varied. All of this illustrates that the authors possess a high degree of skill, and therefore they were able to vividly express the Tatar nation's extremely lyrical optimism, humorous life, and their aesthetic views through their works.

	The entire performance of the Soviet Tatar Autonomous Republic National Song and Dance Ensemble brought many beautiful folk songs and dances, as well as successful works by Soviet composers. Through these song and dance programs with very distinct national characteristics, we saw a sharp contrast between the backward past of the Tatar working people, a component of the great Soviet Union, and the progress, prosperity, and happiness of today's socialist era. This not only increased our understanding of the Tatar nation, but also greatly deepened our friendship. We can say that what connects us is that we all live in a socialist system, what merges our emotions is our shared lofty communist ideal, and great Marxism-Leninism unites us closely. The struggle against imperialism closely links our destinies together. Therefore, watching the performance of the Tatar Autonomous Republic National Song and Dance Ensemble is a good learning experience for our literary and art workers. Obviously, through their visit and performance in our country, not only is the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union further strengthened, but we also see that this great friendship cannot be undermined by any force!

    伟大的友谊
    ——看苏联鞑靼自治共和国国家歌舞团演出
    吕骥  文  叶浅予　速写
    任何一个民族的艺术总有它自己所特有的光彩。虽然这种特有的光彩并不是生活本身，只是生活经过艺术形式反映而投射出来的，可是我们常常借助于这种特异的光彩，对于这个民族的人民的生活历史和他们的美学观点，得到更深的了解。这个思想虽然不是这次看苏联鞑靼自治共和国国家歌舞团的表演才产生的，但看他们的表演，使这个思想在我头脑里更加明确了。
    对于苏联鞑靼自治共和国人民的生活和他们的歌舞艺术，因为过去很少接触，所以了解不多，但是最近在看他们演出的时候，大家一点也不觉得生疏，从音乐方面来说，使我们觉得并不陌生的，首先自然是他们和我们完全相同的五声音阶，以及建立在五声音阶基础上的音乐语言。当然，这些都只是形式方面的因素，重要的还在于内容。音乐所表达的作为苏联人民的一个组成部分的鞑靼民族的劳动人民的淳朴的生活情绪，特别是他们在社会主义建设生活中所唱的充满着幸福和欢乐的新生活的颂歌，尽管歌词所用的语言我们完全不懂，但听了翻译的大意，我们不但觉得完全能够理解，而且觉得十分亲切。
    纳斯列特季诺夫所唱的《致中国朋友》特别激动我们的心弦，作曲家法依齐在这首不长的合唱曲中，以极其抒情的曲调和非常简朴而又富于色彩的和声有力地表达了鞑靼自治共和国的劳动人民对于我国人民的深厚友情。亲切的音调、激动人心的诗句和感情充沛的卓越的表演，把全场听众拥抱了起来。的确，我们的感情完全和友情的歌声融成一体了，我们完全觉得远隔万水千山的喀山古城的人民和我们心连心地坐在一堂。我们听完了歌唱家向战友们表示的致意，情不自禁地报以最热烈的掌声；这自然不只是对于作曲家和歌唱家的创造性的劳动的欢呼，也是对于所有鞑靼自治共和国的劳动人民，对于苏联各族人民的欢呼，对于中苏两国人民之间伟大的友谊的进一步发展的欢呼。
    在这次鞑靼歌舞团的表演中，我们也听到了我们所熟悉的鞑靼著名作曲家日干诺夫的合唱歌曲《我的共和国》。从这首合唱曲中，我们听到了鞑靼民族人民在苏联社会主义大家庭中过着和平、幸福的生活，也听到了他们对于社会主义祖国的热情歌颂。此外，我们也还听到一些反映苏联社会主义、共产主义建设的歌曲，如《卡玛河上的火光》、《新喀山》、《巴甫林石油工人之歌》、《西伯利亚青年之歌》。合唱队怀着无比深厚的友情，用中文演唱了《东方红》这首歌颂我们伟大领袖毛泽东同志的歌。全体合唱队员完全克服了难以读清的中国字音，出色地掌握了中国语言和中国歌曲的特点，表达了他们极其真挚的感情，因而获得了全场听众最热烈的反应。
    大家都听得出来，无论是现代创作，还是改编的鞑靼民歌，无论是歌舞音乐，还是舞蹈伴奏，作者们都选用了适合的形式，把最富有民族特点的素材予以匠心的处理。在合唱中各声部有效地运用，独唱与合唱的应和都十分自然而又富有艺术效果，丝毫不显得臃肿堆砌；在舞蹈伴奏音乐中，有时虽然只有两个手风琴，曲调变化也并不复杂，却把那些充满了诙谐的情趣和节奏明快的舞蹈烘托得十分生动活泼；全部伴奏乐队虽然只有九个人，所有的伴奏却显得十分丰满而又富于变化。所有这些，都说明了作者们具有高度技巧，因此才能够把鞑靼民族极其抒情的乐观情绪、妙趣横生的生活和他们的美学观点通过他们的作品，鲜明地表达出来。
    苏联鞑靼自治共和国国家歌舞团的全部表演，带来了许多优美的民间歌舞，也带来了苏联作曲家的成功的作品，通过这些民族特点十分鲜明的歌舞节目，使我们看到了作为伟大苏联的一个组成部分的鞑靼民族劳动人民的落后的过去和社会主义时代进步、繁荣、幸福的今天的鲜明对比。这样不仅增进了我们对于鞑靼民族的了解，也大大加深了我们之间的友情。我们完全可以说，使我们息息相通的是因为我们都生活在社会主义制度中，把我们的感情融合在一起的是我们共同的崇高的共产主义理想，伟大的马克思列宁主义使我们紧紧地团结起来，对于帝国主义的斗争把我们的命运紧密地联系在一起。所以我们看了鞑靼自治共和国国家歌舞团的表演，对我们文艺工作者是一次很好的学习。显然，通过他们来我国访问演出，不仅进一步加强了中苏两国人民之间的伟大友谊，也使我们看到，这个伟大的友谊是任何力量也不能破坏的！
