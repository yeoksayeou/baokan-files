Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 12th: The Chairman of the Korea-China Friendship Association, Ho Am Dok, hosted a banquet here tonight to welcome the China-Korea Friendship Association delegation led by head of delegation Li Dequan and deputy head of delegation Li Jiebo.

Among those attending the banquet were: Korean Minister of Public Health Choi Chang-seok, Vice Chairman of the Korea-China Friendship Association Hyun Pil-hoon, Vice Chairman of the Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations Choi Ki-cheol, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions Li Jong-soo, and Director of the Third Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Heo Seok-sin. Chinese Ambassador to North Korea Qiao Xiaoguang and embassy staff were invited to the banquet.

In his speech at the banquet, Ho Am Dok extended a warm welcome to the delegation. He said: Over the past fifteen years since the liberation of Korea, under the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, great victories have been achieved in the country's socialist construction and the cause of peaceful reunification of the fatherland. These achievements are inseparable from the internationalist assistance of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries of the socialist camp.

He said that the people of Korea and China, guarding the eastern outpost of socialism, have a common Marxist-Leninist ideology and consistent goals, and are united by an unbreakable proletarian internationalist friendship. During the Korean War and the post-war period, the traditional, blood-cemented friendship and unity between the two peoples has been further consolidated and developed, becoming an eternal and indestructible force. He said that this friendship and cooperative relationship between the people of Korea and China is a reliable guarantee for promoting the prosperity and development of the two countries and safeguarding peace and security in the Far East.

Head of delegation Li Dequan then delivered a speech at the banquet. She praised the great achievements made by the Korean people in post-war reconstruction. She said that these great achievements are the result of the heroic struggle and selfless labor of the Korean people under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party. She said: In the past, our two peoples fought side by side against a common enemy, and now our two peoples help and support each other in the socialist construction of our two countries. The Chinese people will always be loyal to the friendship between our two peoples forged in blood. We believe that in our common struggle to build socialism, oppose imperialism, and defend world peace, our friendship will shine brighter and brighter like the rising sun.

The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere, with the hosts and guests frequently toasting to the friendship between the people of China and Korea and to the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
