In order to carry out this increase production and practice economy movement well, to fully mobilize and organize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, and to quickly achieve practical results in production, the key lies in strengthening leadership. To this end, cadres of Party organizations and administrative leading organs at all levels must immediately take action, go to the front line of production, deep into the communes, production teams, and fields, to factories, mines, and workshops, to stations and docks, to eat, live, labor, and consult with the masses, directly participate in and lead production, and promptly help the lower levels solve key problems in production. Leading cadres of the central government's various business departments should go deep into some major crop, especially grain, key producing areas, and deep into key factories, mining enterprises, and units, to work with local Party committees and commune and factory/mine Party committees to effectively solve specific problems. In short, we must not only carry out this movement well and achieve practical results in increasing production and practicing economy, but also, through this movement, improve the leadership style and working methods of cadres at all levels, make the relationship between leaders and the masses closer, thereby creating better conditions for continued leap forward in the future.

    为了把这次的增产节约运动搞好，把广大群众的积极性、创造性充分发动起来，组织起来，迅速在生产上收到实效，关键在于加强领导。为此，各级党组织和行政领导机关的干部，必须立即行动起来，到生产的第一线去，深入公社、生产队、田间中去，到工厂、矿山、车间中去，到车站、码头上去，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，直接参加和领导生产，及时帮助下面解决生产中的关键问题。中央各业务部门的领导干部应当深入到某些主要农作物、特别是粮食的重点产区，深入到重点厂矿企业单位，协同地方党委和各公社、各厂矿党委切实解决具体问题。总之，我们不但要把这次的运动搞好，切实收到增产节约的实效，而且要通过这次运动，把各级干部的领导作风和工作方法提高一步，使领导和群众的关系更加密切，从而为今后的继续跃进创造更好的条件。
