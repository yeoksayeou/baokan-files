Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 20th: American bourgeois strategist Walter Lippmann published an article on August 17 in the "New York Herald Tribune" commenting on the situation in the Congo, advocating the establishment of a fragmented "federation" in the Congo under the "leadership" of the US-manipulated United Nations, in order to realize American neocolonial rule over the Congo.

Lippmann, wearing the face of an imperialist, slandered the Congolese people for "lacking preparation" for independence, and insisted that the "tragedy of the Congo" was caused by the fact that "the Congo itself had very few trained leaders, administrators, and technicians." He used this as an excuse for the United States to invade the Congo through the United Nations, advocating that the United States should take over "Belgium's political or military power in the Congo" under the banner of the United Nations to fill the "vacuum" in the Congo.

In order to achieve the American conspiracy of divide-and-rule in the Congo and realize the black market deal secretly reached between the United States and Belgian colonialists behind the backs of the Congolese people, Lippmann threatened Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba with "civil war" and world war, demanding that he "abandon the idea of conquering Katanga," that is, he should give up his efforts to maintain the unity and independence of the Republic of the Congo, and let the United Nations manipulated by the United States "study the various huge problems of realizing the Congo Federation" and "solve" them under the "leadership of the United Nations." Lippmann also stated that "trained" Belgian administrative and technical personnel who had "managed the Congo" could be used to serve American rule over the Congo.

Lippmann tried to conceal the ugly face of American neocolonialism in using the United Nations to seize the Congo, deliberately pretending and saying that the Congo issue "is not something that the (American) State Department can try or should try... to solve. The problem is in the United Nations." He deliberately publicized that the United States was not a "leader" in interfering in the Congo, but only a "loyal supporter" of the United Nations, and hypocritically insisted that the United States "does not want to interfere in the Congo."

Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 19th: American bourgeois newspapers continue to cheer for the American neocolonialist tactics of using the United Nations to control the Congo, and advocate further use of the United Nations as a tool for the United States to interfere in and invade other countries.

The August 22nd issue of "U.S. News & World Report," published in advance, touted the United Nations' "new role as police and administrator" in the Congo in a commentary. It openly admitted that "the UN forces will now take over the mission that the Belgians have continued for eighty years in this part of the world."

The magazine advocated long-term rule of the Congo by the United Nations. It emphasized that "the work of the United Nations in the Congo takes time." UN personnel should administer the Congo for "eight to ten years."

This American magazine showed that the United States is attempting to further use the United Nations as a tool for the United States to interfere in and invade other countries. It promoted that the "power of the United Nations is expanding" and advocated gradually turning the United Nations into a "supranational organization with the power to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign countries," a "'world government' with its own army and government."

The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science recently published an article by Joseph Satterthwaite, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, advocating stepping up the invasion of Africa. He particularly emphasized the need to infiltrate Africa under the banner of the United Nations, saying, "We should not play this role alone, but should play this role in cooperation with the United Nations."

    美国新殖民主义面目毕露
    李普曼鼓吹用分而治之的阴谋手法控制刚果
    萨脱斯威特主张美国打联合国招牌渗入非洲
    据新华社20日讯　纽约消息：美国资产阶级策士李普曼17日在“纽约先驱论坛报”发表了一篇评论刚果局势的文章，鼓吹在美国操纵的联合国的“主持下”在刚果建立一个支离破碎的“联邦”，以便于实现美国对刚果的新殖民主义统治。
    李普曼摆出一副帝国主义者的面孔，诬蔑刚果人民对独立“缺乏准备”，硬说“刚果的悲剧”的产生是由于“刚果本身拥有的有训练的领袖、行政人员和技术人员非常少”。他以此作为美国通过联合国侵占刚果的借口，鼓吹美国要打着联合国的旗帜接管“比利时在刚果的政治或军事权力”来填补刚果“这个真空”。
    为了达到美国对刚果分而治之的阴谋和实现美国和比利时殖民者背着刚果人民暗地里达成的黑市买卖，李普曼以“内战”和世界大战威胁刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴，要他“打消征服加丹加的想法”，也就是说要他放弃维护刚果共和国的统一和独立的努力，让美国所操纵的联合国“来研究实现刚果联邦的各项巨大问题”，并在“联合国主持下”加以“解决”。李普曼还表示可以利用“曾经管理刚果的”“有训练的”比利时行政和技术人员为美国统治刚果服务。
    李普曼力图掩饰美国利用联合国霸占刚果的新殖民主义的丑恶面目，故意装腔作势地说，什么刚果问题“不是（美国）国务院可以设法或是应当设法……加以解决的。问题是在联合国。”他故意宣传美国在干涉刚果上并不是“领袖身份”，而只是联合国的“忠诚的支持者”，并此地无银三百两地硬说美国“并不想干预刚果”。
    据新华社19日讯　纽约消息：美国资产阶级报刊继续为美国利用联合国控制刚果的新殖民主义手法叫好，并鼓吹进一步利用联合国作为美国干涉和侵略其他国家的工具。
    提前出版的22日一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志在一篇评论中大肆吹嘘联合国在刚果充当“警察和行政长官的新作用”。它公开承认，“联合国军现在将接管比利时人在世界这个地区继续了八十年的任务”。
    这家杂志鼓吹由联合国长期统治刚果。它强调“联合国在刚果的工作需要时间”。联合国人员要管理刚果“八年到十年”。
    这家美国杂志表明美国企图进一步运用联合国作为美国干涉和侵略其他国家的工具。它宣传联合国的“力量正在扩大”，并鼓吹逐步使联合国变成一个“有权干预主权国家的内政的超国家”、一个“拥有自己的军队和政府的‘世界政府’”。
    美国政治和社会科学院的年鉴最近登载了美国负责非洲事务助理国务卿萨脱斯威特鼓吹加紧侵入非洲的文章。他特别强调要打着联合国的招牌渗入非洲，他说，“我们不应单独起这种作用，而应当同联合国配合一道来起这样的作用”。
