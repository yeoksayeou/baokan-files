Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on the 27th regarding the prevention and control of diseases and pests during autumn and winter sowing, requiring all regions to earnestly carry out the following tasks:

    I. Vigorously prevent rust. Start with the seeds and link every step tightly, grasping early, grasping hard, and grasping thoroughly. Promote disease-resistant varieties, implement multi-variety combinations, and reduce the planting area of rust-susceptible varieties. Especially in areas severely affected in previous years and overwintering disease bases, make every effort to replace all seeds with disease-resistant varieties. In addition to improving seed purity, accelerate the breeding and selection of disease-resistant varieties in a planned manner.

    II. Firmly grasp seed treatment and control of underground pests. Wheat bunt and wheat nematode disease have been basically eliminated through years of seed treatment. However, if seed treatment is not continued, the disease will rebound. Therefore, all regions are required to "prescribe the right medicine" to avoid waste and affecting the control effect. At the same time, during the sowing period, adopt 666 and various effective soil pesticides for seed dressing, or apply poisonous grains or conduct soil treatment to control underground pests, and prevent missing seedlings and broken ridges caused by disease and pest damage.

    III. Establishing disease-free seed multiplication fields is a fundamental measure to eliminate the spread of dangerous diseases and pests. All regions should combine good seed breeding work and establish disease-free seed multiplication fields in a planned manner, starting with the seeds, and implement them in the fields. Currently, in addition to paying attention to selecting good crop rotations for seed multiplication fields, we should especially strictly carry out seed treatment, thoroughly eliminate external and internally latent pathogens in the seeds, and ensure timely sowing, in order to breed a sufficient quantity of disease-free seeds to meet the needs of next year's production.

    IV. While doing a good job in preventing and controlling wheat diseases and pests during the autumn sowing season, it is also necessary to do a good job in preventing and controlling diseases and pests during the sowing season of crops such as rapeseed and green manure.

    农业部通知
    秋冬播种注意预防病虫
    据新华社28日讯　农业部27日发出关于做好秋、冬播种防治病虫工作的通知，要求各地认真做好以下几件工作：
    一、大力预防锈病，从种开始环环扣紧，抓早、抓狠、抓彻底。推广抗病品种，实行多品种组合，压缩易感锈病的品种面积。特别是在历年受害严重地区和越冬发病基地，要千方百计做到全部换种抗病品种。除提高种子纯度外，应有计划地加速抗病品种的繁殖和选育工作。
    二、抓紧种子处理和防治地下害虫。麦类黑穗病和小麦线虫病，经连年推行种子处理，已达到基本消灭为害。但种子处理如不坚持下去，病害便会回升。因此，要求各地“对症下药”，以免浪费和影响防治效果。同时，抓紧播种期间，采用六六六和各种有效土农药拌种，或施毒谷或进行土壤处理以防治地下害虫，防止因病虫为害而造成缺苗断垅。
    三、建立无病留种地是杜绝危险病虫传播的根本措施。各地应结合良种繁育工作，从种开始有计划地建立无病留种地，并落实到田。当前对留种地除注意选好茬口外，尤应严格做好种子处理，彻底消灭种子外在和潜伏内部的病菌，保证适期播种，为满足明年生产需要繁殖足够数量的无病良种。
    四、在做好秋播时期防治小麦病虫的同时，还须做好油菜、绿肥等作物播种时期的病虫防治工作。
