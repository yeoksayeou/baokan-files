    High Spirits, Healthy Bodies, Energetic Production:
    Rizhao County Focuses on Fundamental Sanitation Work, Significantly Reducing the Incidence of Infectious Diseases

    (From Our Newspaper) Shandong Province's Rizhao County, in carrying out the patriotic health campaign, with increasing grain production as a prerequisite, started with manure accumulation, focusing on fundamental sanitation work to eliminate pests and diseases, achieving the goal of "more manure, more grain, good health, and strong bodies."

    Currently, Rizhao County has completely renovated rural toilets, chicken coops, sewage pits, pig pens, sheepfolds, and cattle pens that hinder hygiene and attract mosquitoes and flies. Following the principle of "long-term planning, equal emphasis on quality, no action if not thorough, thorough if action is taken" proposed by the county party committee, new-style public and family toilets have been established in every village. These toilets can all preserve fertilizer effectiveness and meet hygiene requirements. Old-fashioned chicken coops have also been completely renovated. Publicly raised pigs, cattle, and sheep pens have all been moved to the fields, and family pig raising will also move pig pens to the village head or a suitable location. From a long-term perspective, basic construction meeting hygiene requirements has been carried out on all three enclosures (pig, cattle, and sheep pens).

    Currently, the county has newly built more than 2,700 three-enclosure locations, more than 80,000 rooms, more than 35,000 fertilizer pools, more than 3,000 field and roadside toilets, and more than 75,000 double-tank, double-lid toilets for family use. Each production team has designated professional personnel to uniformly manage human and animal excrement, garbage, and sewage inside and outside the village, ensuring prompt accumulation and removal, and accumulating and creating fertilizer in the fields according to the fertilizer needs of high-yield formulas, piling and sealing the accumulated fertilizer for fermentation, and carrying out harmless treatment. Moving the three enclosures to the fields and accumulating and creating fertilizer in the fields can reduce the burden of transporting soil and manure and save labor and tools. According to statistics, the county saved more than 900,000 labor days in transporting soil and manure last year alone. At the same time, with the three enclosures and manure accumulation in the fields, the village is clean and hygienic. Moving the three enclosures to the fields is also conducive to livestock epidemic prevention and facilitates livestock grazing and use.

    The county also strives to completely eliminate the four pests. Since the beginning of this year, the county has launched four large-scale blitzes, each involving 200,000 to 300,000 people; after the blitzes, organizations are immediately improved, systems are established, and the effort is shifted to a regular basis, so that the elimination of the four pests and the emphasis on hygiene can continue to develop in depth.

    Now, the people of the county have initially developed the habit of paying attention to hygiene and cleanliness. In Jin Gou, Chengguan, and other communes, every household has its own foot-operated automatic water dispenser, using running water to wash hands before meals and after using the toilet. Many families have achieved one basin and one towel per person. Many public canteens have established multi-pot partitioned stoves, which save fuel and are hygienic. The fly-proof, dust-proof, and anti-corrosion equipment in the canteens is also better. Entering the summer, no food poisoning has occurred in the county.

    Due to the good sanitation work throughout the county, the incidence of seasonal infectious diseases this year has decreased by more than 90% compared to the same period last year. Since 1958, the labor attendance rate has continued to increase, which has played an important role in promoting increased grain production.

    日照县大抓卫生治本工作　全县传染病发病率显著下降
    本报讯　山东省日照县在开展爱国卫生运动中，以增产粮食为前提，从积肥入手，大抓除害灭病讲卫生的治本工作，达到了“多积肥，多打粮，卫生好，身体强”的目的。
    目前，日照县对农村有碍卫生，招引孳生蚊蝇的厕所、鸡窝、污水坑、猪圈、羊圈、牛栏等，已全部进行了改建。按照县委提出的“长远规划、质量并重，不治便罢，治必彻底”的原则，村村建立了新型公共厕所、家庭厕所。这些厕所都能保肥效和合乎卫生要求。旧式鸡窝也全部进行了改建。公养猪、牛、羊的栏圈全部移到田间，家庭养猪也将猪圈移到村头或适中地点，从长远打算，对三圈（猪、牛、羊圈）都进行了合乎卫生要求的基本建设。
    目前，全县共新建三圈两千七百多处，八万多间，造肥池三万五千多个，田间、路旁厕所三千多处，家庭用的双罐双盖厕所七万五千多处。各生产队对村内外人畜粪便、垃圾、污水等都指定专业人员进行统一管理，做到随积随清，并按丰产方用肥需要，在田间积肥造肥，对所积肥料培堆泥封发酵，进行无害化处理。三圈到田和田间积肥造肥可以减少搬土送粪的负担，节省劳力、工具。据统计，全县仅去年一年就节省搬土送粪九十多万个劳动力。同时，三圈和积肥到田，村内干净卫生。三圈到田还有利于牲畜防疫，也便于牲畜放牧和使用。
    这个县对除四害也力求彻底消灭。今年以来，全县共发动大规模的突击运动四次，每次都有二、三十万人参加；突击之后，便立即健全组织，订立制度，转入经常，使除四害讲卫生持续深入开展下去。
    现在，全县人民已初步养成了讲卫生、爱清洁的习惯。在金沟、城关等公社，家家设有群众自己创造的脚踏自动流水器，饭前便后用流水洗手。许多家庭作到了一人一盆一巾。许多公共食堂都建立了多锅隔壁灶，既省柴又卫生。食堂内的防蝇、防尘、防腐设备也较好。进入夏季，全县没有发生过食物中毒现象。
    由于全县卫生工作做得好，今年季节性传染病发病率比去年同期下降90％以上。自1958年以来，劳动出勤率不断提高，对于促进粮食增产起了重要作用。
