Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 18th: According to TASS, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union publicly tried American spy pilot Powers on the 17th in the Column Hall of the Trade Union Building in Moscow.

More than 1,500 people were present, including representatives from all walks of life in the Soviet Union, famous foreign social activists, jurists, lawyers, and diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries stationed in the Soviet Union.

Various physical evidences exposing Powers' espionage activities were displayed in the showcases in the trial hall.

The indictment read in court stated that the American "U-2" aircraft that invaded Soviet airspace on May 1st flew over many major industrial centers and important defense targets in the Soviet Union. Observation materials have undoubtedly proven that this was a deliberate intrusion into Soviet airspace with hostile intentions.

According to the order of the Soviet government, the aircraft was shot down by the first launched rocket at an altitude of 20,000 meters above the Sverdlovsk region, its position being more than 2,000 kilometers away from the point of intrusion. The pilot parachuted and was immediately captured. It was determined during the first interrogation that he was an American citizen named Powers.

Preliminary investigation results determined that the spy flight "was organized by an American special reconnaissance unit with the knowledge of the American government. This unit was stationed in Turkey and its code name was '10-10'".

The indictment pointed out that the statements made by American national figures Herter, Nixon, and Eisenhower regarding this reconnaissance flight "are official confirmations of the hostile activities conducted by the United States against the Soviet Union for many years, which manifested as American aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace more than once for reconnaissance purposes."

In this way, the US government formally announced in peacetime a policy that could only be pursued when a country is at war.

The indictment stated that the intrusion of American aircraft into the Soviet border more than once is an intolerable violation of the universally recognized norms of international law, which stipulates that each country has complete privilege over its airspace.

The intrusion of American aircraft, especially "Lockheed U-2" aircraft, is a gross violation of Soviet sovereignty, a trampling of international law norms, and an act of aggression that undermines the lofty principles of the United Nations Charter, which the United States also signed.

The indictment pointed out that in a situation where certain countries possess nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them to targets in an instant, this act of aggression could bring the most serious consequences to mankind.

The US government's sinful destruction of universally recognized norms of international law is part of the US government's aggressive diplomatic line.

The indictment pointed out that this policy is manifested in: the conclusion of aggressive treaties and alliances under the protection of the United States in almost all regions of the world, the arms race, the establishment of a network of military bases around the borders of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, frequent intrusions of American aircraft into the Soviet border, and other aggressive actions that threaten universal peace and security.

The investigation proved that the intrusion of American aircraft would not be possible without the use of air bases in countries near the Soviet border, such as Turkey, Pakistan, and Norway, because "Lockheed U-2" aircraft, due to range limitations, could not reach from American territory.

The indictment pointed out that according to the instructions of the "10-10" unit command, Powers had been flying "Lockheed U-2" aircraft along the border between the Soviet Union and Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan for espionage flights since 1956.

On the night of April 30, Powers received the mission two and a half hours before takeoff to fly from south to north at an altitude of 20,000 meters in Soviet airspace, the route being: Peshawar, Aral Sea, Sverdlovsk, Kirov, Arkhangelsk, Murmansk, and then land at Budø Airport in Norway.

Thus, the investigation once again proves that the American military bases established on the territory of certain foreign countries are a threat to peace and the security of the people of all countries.

The aircraft had no national markings and was equipped with a special set of photographic and radio technical reconnaissance equipment and a demolition device to destroy the aircraft, which clearly proved the reconnaissance mission of the aircraft.

It has been ascertained that the area photographed from the aircraft with long-focal-length cameras was Soviet territory west of Tashkent to Sverdlovsk. There were many military and civilian airports on these films, as well as important industrial targets in the Southern Urals.

Aerial photographs include various intelligence that can be used for reconnaissance purposes, as well as for mapping and determining the coordinates of military strategic targets.

After being interrogated on the substance of the indictment, Powers has pleaded guilty. He confessed:

"I admit that my crime is: flying in Soviet airspace and over the locations indicated to me, opening and closing the corresponding special devices installed on my aircraft. I believe that this was done to obtain reconnaissance intelligence about the Soviet Union."

"According to the contract I signed with the US Central Intelligence Agency, I am a pilot of the US Special Aviation Unit, whose job is to collect information about existing radio stations and radio direction-finding devices on Soviet territory, and I assume, also to collect information on rocket deployment locations."

Powers is accused of being recruited by the US Central Intelligence Agency in 1956 to actively carry out espionage activities against the Soviet Union, which reflected the aggressive policy pursued by the US government.

With the knowledge of the US government, and according to the instructions of the US reconnaissance agency to implement this aggressive policy, Powers invaded Soviet territory on May 1 this year in a specially equipped "Lockheed U-2" reconnaissance aircraft in order to collect strategic intelligence on the deployment of missile bases, airports, radio direction-finding networks, and other particularly important defense and industrial targets. This intelligence is a state and military secret of the Soviet Union.

Powers flew his aircraft more than 2,000 kilometers into Soviet territory, using specialized photographic equipment to photograph many targets, record signals from radio direction-finding stations, and collect other materials of an espionage nature.

Powers committed a crime under Article 2 of the Soviet law "On Criminal Responsibility for State Crimes."

The indictment was signed by Shelepin, Chairman of the State Security Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. The indictment was approved by Soviet Prosecutor General Rudenko.

After the indictment was read, the presiding judge asked the defendant Powers whether he admitted that he was guilty in the charges brought against him. Powers replied: "Yes, I admit that I am guilty."

Then, Soviet Prosecutor General Rudenko began interrogating Powers.

The trial continued on the 18th.

    苏联公审美国间谍飞行员
    鲍尔士面对罪证供认间谍罪行
    起诉书指出间谍活动是美国侵略政策的一部分
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高法院军事审判庭17日在莫斯科的工会大厦圆柱大厅公审美国间谍飞行员鲍尔士。
    列席旁听的有苏联各界代表、外国著名社会活动家和法学家、律师以及各国驻苏联外交使节和官员等一千五百多人。
    在审讯大厅的橱窗里展出了揭露鲍尔士进行间谍活动的各种物证。
    法庭上宣读的起诉书中说，5月1日侵入苏联国境的美国“Ｕ—2”飞机飞过了苏联许多大工业中心和重要的国防目标上空。观测材料已确凿无疑地证明，这是有意抱着敌对目的侵入苏联领空的。
    根据苏联政府的命令，飞机已被第一支射出的火箭在斯维德洛夫斯克地区上空两万米的高处击落，当时它的位置离开犯境处已有两千多公里。飞行员跳伞，旋即被擒。在第一次询问时就已确定他是美国公民鲍尔士。
    初步侦查结果确定，这架飞机的间谍飞行“是由一个美国特别侦察分队在美国政府知道的情况下组织的，这个部队驻扎在土耳其，它的代号是‘10—10’”。
    起诉书中指出，美国国家活动家赫脱、尼克松和艾森豪威尔关于这次侦察飞行的声明，“是美国多年来进行的敌视苏联的活动的官方的证实，这种活动表现为：美国飞机不止一次地抱着侦察目的侵入苏联领空”。
    这样，美国政府就是在和平时期正式宣布了只有国家处于战争状态时才能奉行的政策。
    起诉书中说，美国飞机不止一次地侵入苏联国境，这是对公认的国际法准则的难以容忍的破坏，国际法规定每个国家对于本国领空拥有完全的特权。
    美国飞机，特别是“洛克希德Ｕ—2型”飞机的入侵，是对苏联主权的粗暴的破坏，是蹂躏国际法准则和破坏美国也签了字的联合国宪章的崇高原则的侵略行动。
    起诉书指出，在某些国家拥有核武器和一瞬间就能把核武器送到目标的手段的情况下，这一侵略行动会给人类带来最严重的后果。
    美国政府罪恶破坏公认的国际法准则，这是美国政府侵略性的外交路线的一个部分。
    起诉书中指出，这种政策表现为：几乎在世界各个地区都在美国的庇护下缔结侵略条约和联盟，进行军备竞赛，在苏联和其他社会主义国家边境周围建立军事基地网，经常有美国飞机侵入苏联边境，以及采取威胁普遍和平和安全的其他侵略行动。
    侦查证明，不利用苏联国境附近的国家例如土耳其、巴基斯坦和挪威领土上的空军基地，美国飞机的入侵是不可能实现的，因为“洛克希德Ｕ—2型”飞机由于航程的限制，从美国领土起飞是不可能到达的。
    起诉书指出，根据“10—10”部队指挥部的指示，鲍尔士从1956年就驾驶“洛克希德Ｕ—2型”飞机沿苏联同土耳其、伊朗和阿富汗的接境处进行间谍飞行。
    4月30日夜间，鲍尔士在起飞前两个半小时接到任务，要在苏联领空以两万米的高度从南向北飞行，路线是：白沙瓦、咸海、斯维德洛夫斯克、基洛夫、阿尔汉格尔斯克、摩尔曼斯克，然后在挪威的布德机场降落。
    这样，侦查再一次证明，在某些外国领土上建立的美国军事基地是对和平和各国人民安全的威胁。
    飞机没有国籍标志，上面有一套摄影和无线电技术侦察的特别装置和销毁飞机的爆破装置，这就明显地证明了这架飞机的侦察使命。
    已经查明，从飞机上用远焦距照相机拍摄下来的地区是塔什干以西到斯维德洛夫斯克的苏联领土。这些胶卷上有许多军用和民用飞机场，还有南乌拉尔的重要工业目标。
    空中摄影照片包括各种情报，可以用于侦察目的，也可以用来绘制地图，还可以确定军事战略目标的座标。
    鲍尔士经过根据起诉实质进行审问后，已承认有罪。他供认：
  “我承认我的罪行是：在苏联领空和指示给我的地点上空飞行，在航线上开闭安装在我的飞机上的相应的特别装置。我认为，这样做是为了得到关于苏联的侦察情报”。
      “根据我同美国中央情报局签订的合同，我是美国特别航空分队的飞行员，这个分队的工作是搜集有关苏联领土上现有的无线电台和无线电测位装置，我设想，还要搜集火箭配置地点的情报”。
    鲍尔士被控，1956年被美国中央情报局招募，积极对苏联进行间谍活动，这种活动反映了美国政府所奉行的侵略政策。
    鲍尔士在美国政府知道的情况下，根据实现这种侵略政策的美国侦察机关的指示，于今年5月1日驾驶具有特别装备的“洛克希德Ｕ—2型”侦察机侵入苏联领土，以便搜集关于火箭基地、飞机场、无线电测位网和其他特别重要的国防和工业目标的配置情况的战略情报。这些情报是苏联的国家和军事秘密。
    鲍尔士驾驶飞机深入苏联领土两千多公里，他用专门的摄影装备拍摄了许多目标并录下了无线电测位站的讯号，还搜集了其他间谍性质的材料。
    鲍尔士犯了苏联“关于国事罪刑事责任”法律的第二条的罪行。
    在起诉书上签字的是苏联部长会议国家安全委员会主席谢列平。苏联总检察长鲁金科批准了这份起诉书。
    在宣读起诉书之后，被告鲍尔士回答审判长的问题：他是否承认在对他提出的控诉中他是有罪的。鲍尔士回答说：“是，我承认自己是有罪的”。
    接着，由苏联总检察长鲁金科开始对鲍尔士进行审问。
    18日，审讯还在继续进行。
