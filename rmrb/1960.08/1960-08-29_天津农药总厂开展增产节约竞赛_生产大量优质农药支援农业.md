Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The Tianjin Pesticide Plant is conducting a campaign to increase production and practice economy, making every effort to increase the production of high-efficiency, diverse pesticides to supply the countryside and promote increased grain and cotton production.
    In mid-July, under the leadership of the factory's Party Committee, the plant's employees summarized the achievements and experiences of overfulfilling the state plan in the first half of the year, formulated plans and specific measures at all levels to ensure the completion of the production plan for the second half of the year, and assigned specific personnel to be responsible for each measure, with deadlines for implementation. Workshops, work sections, and groups all launched labor competitions, striving to achieve the plan as soon as possible, with daily inspections and evaluations every ten days.
    One of the outstanding achievements of the plant's production in the first half of the year was the vigorous development of raw material production and the economical use of substitutes. In the first half of the year, without increasing equipment or manpower, the output of three main types of organophosphorus pesticides was higher than the total output for the entire previous year, and the output of organosulfur pesticides increased by more than three times compared to the total output of the previous year; in addition, nine new products were successfully trial-produced, including four, such as "Endosulfan", which are easy to use, have a long shelf life, and can be absorbed internally by plants, have already been produced in batches.
    The workers realized that fully utilizing the production experience of the first half of the year, vigorously developing raw material production, and reducing raw material consumption were the keys to ensuring the completion of the production plan for the second half of the year. Therefore, when formulating plans, factories, workshops, work sections, and groups, in addition to focusing on the five indicators of output, quality, variety, safety, and cost, focused on studying ways to increase production and conserve raw materials. The "Dipterex" pesticide production group used to recover 700 kilograms of hydrochloric acid from waste liquid for every ton of "Dipterex" pesticide produced. Now, they can recover one ton of hydrochloric acid, achieving their new target. Workers producing "Shilete" pesticide, in order to use less or no formaldehyde raw material, actively worked with technicians to develop a new product called "Weibamu" with the same efficacy as "Shilete." Producing one ton of the finished product only requires half a ton of formaldehyde, one ton less than before. Recently, this group also created a new product called "Baozhining" that does not use formaldehyde at all, replacing "Shilete" pesticide.

### 天津农药总厂开展增产节约竞赛  生产大量优质农药支援农业

    天津农药总厂开展增产节约竞赛
    生产大量优质农药支援农业
    据新华社讯　天津市农药总厂职工开展增产节约竞赛运动，千方百计增产效率高、品种多的农药，供应农村，促进粮棉增产。
    7月中旬，这个厂的职工在工厂党委领导下，总结了上半年超额完成国家计划的成就和经验，层层制订了保证完成下半年生产计划的规划和具体措施，对每项措施都指定了专人负责，限期实现。各车间、工段和小组都以力争早日实现规划为条件，开展了劳动竞赛，每天一检查，每旬一评比。
    这个厂上半年生产的突出成绩之一是，大搞原料生产和节约代用。上半年这个厂在不增加设备和人力的情况下，三种主要有机磷类农药的产量比去年全年产量还多，有机硫类农药的产量比去年全年的产量增长了三倍多；另外还试制成功了九种新产品，其中使用方便、有效期长、能为植物内吸的“内吸灵”等四种已经成批生产。
    职工们认识到，充分运用上半年的生产经验，大搞原料生产和降低原料消耗，是保证完成下半年生产计划的关键。因此，工厂、车间、工段、小组在制订规划的时候，除了狠抓产量、质量、品种、安全、成本等五项指标以外，着重研究了增产节约原料的办法。“敌百虫”农药生产小组过去生产一吨“敌百虫”农药，从废液中回收七百公斤盐酸，现在已可回收一吨盐酸，实现了他们的新的指标。生产“什来特”农药的工人，为了少用或不用甲醛原料，积极和技术人员研究，制出一种和“什来特”药效相同的新产品“维巴母”，生产一吨成品只需用半吨甲醛，比过去少用一吨。最近这个小组又制造出一种根本不用甲醛的新产品——“保植宁”，代替“什来特”农药。
