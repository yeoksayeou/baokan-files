Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 11th -- The whole party and people of Benxi City, Liaoning Province, have initially overcome the extraordinary flood, the largest in recorded history. In the struggle against the flood, many cadres and workers bravely protected industrial and agricultural production, rescued state property, and saved besieged masses, demonstrating a high degree of communist style.

On the 3rd and 4th of this month, the Benxi area was at the center of a rainstorm. Due to the excessive concentration of rain, mountain torrents broke out, and the Taizi River water level rose sharply to more than twenty meters, exceeding the warning level by more than eight meters. The flood brought serious threats to the urban and rural people of Benxi City on both sides of the river. Parts of the urban area were flooded, and the production of some factories and mines was seriously affected. The railway was completely interrupted, and a large number of farmlands in the subordinate Benxi and Huanren counties and suburban rural areas were also flooded.

As early as before the disaster occurred, the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China made two sets of arrangements for production and flood prevention based on the forecast of heavy rain. After the disaster occurred, the work of the Flood Control Headquarters was strengthened by Ren Zhiyuan, the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee. Cadres and masses of various organs, enterprises, schools, and troops were also organized to actively participate in the rescue struggle.

The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Benxi area stood at the forefront of the flood fighting struggle. Two hundred officers and soldiers of a PLA unit, in order to rescue the residents of Daijiabao surrounded by floods, held hands, overcame obstacles, broke through gaps, and rescued all the residents of the village. Many workers, farmers, students and public security fighters have shown a high degree of communist spirit of self-sacrifice. Zhao Kaisheng, an inspector at the Municipal Chemical Plant, when his own factory was about to flood, thought of a bucket of metallic sodium in the factory. This thing would explode when it came into contact with water. He quickly rushed into the flood with technician Guan Chengyuan. The two held the metallic sodium high and waded through the rapids, finally rescuing state property and ensuring the safety of the entire factory. Wang Chongfu, a turner of the Yaojiawanzi Production Team of the Heping People's Commune in the suburbs, and his three partners, after the village was flooded, drove large carts door-to-door to rescue things. After most of other people's things were rescued, Wang Chongfu, under the urging of Deputy Captain Wang Chongfa, rescued his wife, children and some of his belongings. Communist Party member Ni Haishan and militiaman Bai Yuhong, etc., risked being washed away by the flood, and cooperated with comrades from the hydrological station to rescue the instruments for measuring hydrology. The four comrades at the hydrological station would rather sacrifice all their personal belongings to rescue the things of the masses.

At present, the water level of the Taizi River has receded below the warning level. The city's post-disaster resumption of production and disaster relief work is proceeding smoothly, and the living problems of the affected masses have been properly arranged. As of the 10th, the three railway lines between Shenyang and Benxihu, Benxi and Andong, and Liaoyang and Benxi have been repaired, and some factories that were temporarily suspended due to the disaster have gradually resumed work. The Nanfen Concentrator and the Nanfen Open-pit Iron Mine overcame the flood and resumed production the day after the disaster (6th), and production reached normal levels on the third day.

    本溪广大群众高度发扬共产主义风格
    人人舍己为公协力战胜洪水
    三条铁路线都已修复，部分停工工厂陆续恢复生产
    新华社本溪11日电　辽宁省本溪市全党全民已经初步战胜了有纪录以来的特大洪水。在抗洪斗争中，许多干部和职工，英勇地保护工农业生产和抢运国家财物，抢救被围群众，表现了高度的共产主义风格。
    本月3、4两日，本溪地区一直处在暴雨的中心。由于暴雨过分集中，引起山洪暴发，太子河水位猛涨到二十米以上，超过警戒水位八米多，洪水给沿河两岸的本溪市城乡人民带来了严重威胁。市区部分进水，有一部分厂矿生产受到严重影响，铁路也全部中断，所属本溪、桓仁两县和郊区农村也有大批农田被淹。
    早在灾情发生之前，中共本溪市委就根据将有暴雨的预报，作了生产、防汛两套安排。灾情发生后，又由市委第一书记任志远挂帅，加强了防汛总指挥部的工作。各机关、企业、学校、部队的干部和群众也组织起来积极参加了抢救斗争。
    驻本溪地区的人民解放军官兵站在抗洪斗争的最前列。解放军某部二百名官兵，为抢救被洪水包围的戴家堡居民，手牵着手，战胜障碍，突破缺口，救出全屯居民。许多工人、农民、学生和公安战士，都表现出了舍己为人的高度的共产主义风格。市化工厂检验员赵恺生在自己工厂即将进水的时候，想起厂里还有一桶金属钠。这种东西一碰到水就要爆炸。他连忙和技术人员关成远冲进洪水，两人把金属钠举得老高，涉过急流，终于抢救出国家财产，保全了全厂的安全。郊区和平人民公社姚家湾子生产小队车工王崇福和他的三个伙伴，在村子被淹后，赶着大车挨门逐户地抢运东西。别家的东西大部抢运出去以后，王崇福才在副队长王崇发的督促下，把自己的妻小和部分东西抢救出来。共产党员倪海山和民兵白玉洪等，冒着被洪水冲走的危险，配合水文站的同志救出了测量水文的仪器。而水文站的四个同志，宁可牺牲个人的全部东西，前去抢运群众的东西。
    目前，太子河水位已经退回警戒水位以下，全市灾后的恢复生产和救灾工作，正在顺利进行，受灾群众的生活问题，已得到妥善安排。到10日止，沈阳到本溪湖、本溪到安东和辽阳到本溪之间的三条铁路线都已修复，部分因受灾而暂时停止生产的工厂已经陆续复工。南芬选矿厂和南芬露天铁矿战胜水灾后，已于灾后第二天（6日）恢复生产，第三日生产即达到正常的水平。
