Academic Trends

    Discussions on the issue of the identity of thinking and being have unfolded in academic circles across various regions. Many provincial and municipal philosophy and social science societies have held symposiums, and local theoretical publications have also published numerous articles discussing the issue recently.

    The seventh issue of Anhui's "Emptiness and Reality" magazine published an article under the pseudonym An Jiwen. The author comprehensively summarized various aspects of this issue and discussed the significant practical implications of this discussion. The author pointed out that in practical work, whether or not one acknowledges the dialectical materialist principle of the identity of thinking and being is related to the following issues: (1) How to treat the guiding role of theory and the issue of putting politics in command; (2) How to treat proceeding from reality and conducting investigation and research; (3) How to treat the subjective dynamic role of people; (4) How to treat continuous revolution (if one believes that the unity of thinking and being, the subjective and the objective, is not the identity of contradictions but an absolutely rigid conformity that can be completed once and for all, it will inevitably lead to right-leaning conservatism); (5) How to treat achievements and shortcomings in practical work (the consistency of the subjective and the objective is a process, and people cannot reflect objective things absolutely perfectly all at once).

    The seventh issue of Nanjing's "Jianghai Academic Journal" published an article titled "Looking at the Issue of the Identity of Thinking and Being from the History of Philosophy." The author, Xia Bingxue, analyzed the views of various philosophical schools before Marxism on this issue, pointing out: "Naive materialism, vulgar materialism, and subjective idealism only acknowledge the identity of thinking and being and do not acknowledge the difference between thinking and being. Dualism only acknowledges the difference between the two and does not acknowledge their identity. Although mechanical materialism acknowledges their difference, it also acknowledges their unity, but it does not understand their dialectical unity." These views are all metaphysical. Hegel was the first to consciously apply dialectics to epistemology, putting forward the proposition of "the identity of thinking and being," and demonstrated the dialectical identity of thinking and being, the subjective and the objective, spirit and nature, logic and history, etc., but he demonstrated this identity on the basis of thorough idealism. Only Marxism truly solved the problem of the identity of thinking and being.

    In discussions across various regions, some new questions have also been raised, the most important of which is whether there is identity between erroneous thinking and being. This question was raised at symposiums in Hubei, Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places. Some comrades believe that there is no identity between erroneous thinking and being, the reasons being: the identity of contradictions is conditional and relative, and there is identity between thinking and being only when thinking correctly reflects being, otherwise there is no identity; the process of people's cognitive development is from not knowing to knowing, from one-sided and superficial knowledge to multi-faceted and essential knowledge, which is the process of the continuous breaking and continuous establishment of the identity of thinking and being, so identity is not consistently thorough; although erroneous ideas have their objective origins, they do not conform to objective reality, cannot be transformed into objective existence, and cannot play a transformative role on objective existence; if it is said that both erroneous and correct ideas have identity with being, then it is impossible to distinguish between error and truth. Other comrades disagree with this view, believing that: the identity of thinking and being is a universal philosophical proposition, which applies to both correct thinking and erroneous thinking, and the contradictory unity relationship between thinking and being cannot be changed due to the error of thinking; erroneous thinking is also a reflection of objective existence, and it can also be partially transformed into reality, because people will also act under the guidance of erroneous thinking, and this action can also play a counter-role on existence (of course, it will eventually fail); if the identity of erroneous thinking and being is denied, the struggle against erroneous thinking will be relaxed. Shanghai's "Academic Monthly" published two articles in its July issue this year with opposing viewpoints on this issue.

    At a symposium in Guangzhou's philosophical circles, the question of what the unity of thinking and being is was discussed. According to a report in the May issue of "Theory and Practice": some comrades proposed that one cannot say that the unity in which thinking and being coexist is the objective material world, but rather the practical process. The main reason is: contradictions and the unity in which they coexist occur and end together, therefore, "it is obviously inappropriate to regard the eternally existing objective material world as the unity in which the historical, conditional, and concrete contradictions of thinking and being coexist." Most of the comrades participating in the discussion believe that: the unity of thinking and being is the objective material world, and practice is the condition for the mutual transformation of thinking and being; practice is not some supreme category beyond thinking and being, its existence originates from the existence of the subject of the material world, namely man.

    The discussion shows that there are still some different opinions on "the identity of thinking and being." At a symposium held by the Anhui Provincial Philosophy and Social Science Society, some individual comrades said that the relationship between thinking and being has its particularities, and therefore, they believe that the principle of "the identity of contradictions" does not fully apply to the relationship between thinking and being. In recent issues of "Xinjiang Red Flag," in addition to publishing articles criticizing Shi Cheng's argument that denies the identity of thinking and being, it has also published several articles with opposing viewpoints in the spirit of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." In an article by Ma Qifang in the fourteenth issue of "Xinjiang Red Flag" this year, it is said, "There was still objective existence before mankind. Therefore, thinking and being are not a contradictory unity." It also says, "For example, socialist thought and socialist existence, capitalist thought and capitalist existence, who has contradictions with whom between them?" At a symposium jointly convened by the Inner Mongolia Philosophical Society and the Inner Mongolia Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, some people also believed that "being can be transformed into thinking, but thinking cannot be transformed into being," and on this basis, they believed that thinking and being have no identity. The seventh issue of "Practice" published an article criticizing this argument this year.

### 各省市学术界讨论思维和存在的同一性问题

    各省市学术界讨论思维和存在的同一性问题
    关于思维和存在的同一性问题的讨论，已在各地的学术界展开，许多省、市的哲学社会科学学会举行了座谈会，地方理论刊物最近一个时期也发表了不少讨论文章。
    安徽的《虚与实》杂志第七期上，发表了署名安集文的一篇文章。作者比较全面地概括了这个问题的各个方面，并论述了这次讨论的重大现实意义。作者指出，在实际工作中，承认不承认辩证唯物主义关于思维和存在的同一性原理，关系到下列几个问题：（一）怎样对待理论的指导作用和政治挂帅的问题；（二）怎样对待从实际出发和调查研究的问题；（三）怎样对待人的主观能动作用的问题；（四）怎样对待不断革命的问题（如果以为思维和存在、主观和客观的统一不是矛盾的同一，是可以一次完成的绝对僵死的符合，那就必然导致右倾保守）；（五）怎样对待实际工作中的成绩和缺点的问题（主观和客观的一致是一个过程，人们不可能一下子绝对完善地反映客观事物）。
    南京《江海学刊》第七期上登载了《从哲学史看思维和存在的同一性问题》的文章，作者夏冰雪分析了马克思主义以前各派哲学家对这个问题的看法，指出：“朴素唯物主义、庸俗唯物主义和主观唯心主义，只承认思维和存在的同一性，不承认思维和存在的差别性。二元论只承认二者的差别性，不承认二者的同一性。机械唯物主义虽然承认了它们的差别性，又承认了它们的统一，但是，却不理解它们的辩证的统一。”这几种见解都是形而上学的。黑格尔第一个自觉地把辩证法运用于认识论，提出了“思维和存在同一”的命题，论证了思维和存在、主观和客观、精神和自然、逻辑和历史等等的辩证的同一性，但他是从彻底的唯心主义的基础上来论证这种同一性的。只有马克思主义才真正解决了思维和存在的同一性问题。
    各地在讨论中，也提出了一些新的问题，其中最主要的是错误的思维和存在有没有同一性的问题。湖北、南京、上海、天津等地的座谈会上都提出了这个问题。有些同志认为，错误的思维和存在没有同一性，理由是：矛盾的同一性是有条件的，相对的，思维正确地反映了存在，二者才有同一性，否则就没有同一性；人的认识发展过程是由不知到知，由片面的、表面的知到多方面的、本质的知，这就是思维和存在的同一性不断破裂和不断建立的过程，所以同一性不是贯彻始终的；错误的思想虽然有其客观根源，但是并不符合客观实际，不能转化为客观存在，不能对客观存在起改造作用；如果说错误的思想和正确的思想都和存在有同一性，那就不能区别错误和真理了。另外有些同志不同意这种看法，认为：思维和存在的同一性是哲学上的普遍命题，既适用于正确的思维，也适用于错误的思维，思维与存在的对立统一关系不能因思维的错误而改变，如果说错误的思维和存在没有同一性，那就否认了对立统一规律的普遍性；错误的思维也是客观存在的一种反映，它也能局部地转化为现实，因为人们也会在错误的思维指导下去行动，这种行动也能对存在起反作用（当然最后会失败）；如果否认错误的思维和存在的同一性，就会放松对错误思维的斗争。上海的《学术月刊》今年七月号上，就发表了关于这个问题的两篇观点针锋相对的文章。
    广州哲学界的座谈会上，谈到了思维和存在的统一体是什么的问题。据今年五月号的《理论与实践》报道：有的同志提出，不能说思维和存在所共处的统一体是客观物质世界，而应说是实践过程。主要理由是：矛盾和它所共处的统一体，是一齐发生、一齐完结的，因此，“把永恒存在的客观物质世界看作是历史的、有条件的具体的思维和存在的矛盾所共处的统一体，这显然是不妥当的。”多数参加讨论的同志认为：思维和存在的统一体是客观物质世界，而实践是思维和存在相互转化的条件；实践并不是一个什么超出思维和存在之上的最大范畴，它的存在根源于物质世界的主体的人的存在。
    讨论表明，对于“思维和存在的同一性”，仍然有一些不同的意见。安徽省哲学社会科学学会举行的座谈会上，个别同志说，思维和存在的关系有其特殊性，因此，他们就认为“矛盾的同一性”原理，并不完全适用于思维和存在的关系。最近几期的《新疆红旗》上，除发表了批评世诚的否认思维和存在具有同一性的论点的文章外，也按照“百家争鸣”的精神发表了几篇反面观点的文章。《新疆红旗》今年第十四期上马其芳的一篇文章里说，“没有人类之前，仍然有客观存在。所以思维和存在并不是一个对立的统一体。”又说，“比如社会主义思想和社会主义存在，资本主义思想和资本主义存在，它们之间谁与谁有矛盾呢？”在内蒙古哲学学会和中国科学院内蒙古分院联合召开的座谈会上，也有人认为“存在可以转化为思维，但思维不能转化为存在”，并以此认为思维和存在没有同一性。《实践》今年第七期上发表了批评这种论点的文章。
