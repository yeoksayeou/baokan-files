Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The Ministry of Food, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Education, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League recently jointly issued a notice calling on their affiliated units to launch a mass movement to harvest and sell castor seeds, sunflower seeds, other minor oilseeds, and wild oilseeds.

The notice stated that the castor and sunflowers planted in various regions are now gradually maturing, and walnuts and hazelnuts will soon be harvested. To ensure a bumper harvest and further encourage the enthusiasm of the broad masses for oilseed production, promoting the high-speed development of oilseed production, all localities should, in accordance with the spirit of grasping production from planting to harvest, adhere to putting politics in command, mobilize the broad masses, vigorously promote inter-departmental collaboration, and promptly and effectively manage the late-stage management, harvesting, and sales of castor, sunflowers, and other minor oilseeds.

The notice put forward several suggestions on how to do this work well:

1.  Based on the specific growth conditions of castor and sunflowers, all localities should immediately take effective measures to ensure that these crops are well managed, harvested, and sold. Early-maturing areas should harvest in a timely manner, harvesting as each patch matures; scattered plantings should be harvested plant by plant as they mature, organizing sales and storage while harvesting. Areas with later maturity should continue to strengthen late-stage management to prevent potential losses.

2.  Under the leadership of the Party Committee, it is necessary to unify planning, comprehensively arrange labor, closely combine with the local central work, and make full use of any available time to mobilize the broad masses of young people to carry out harvesting. At the same time, the members of the people's commune, cadres, workers, troops, and urban residents should be fully mobilized to launch a high tide of harvesting and organizing the sale of castor seeds and sunflower seeds. The broad masses of young people should, as they did during planting, continue to be the shock force in late-stage management, harvesting, and sales, and at the same time, be outstanding propagandists.

3.  The grain and commerce departments should conscientiously do a good job in purchasing and seed retention. In particular, it is necessary to vigorously implement the policy of "the income from collective planting belongs to the collective, and the income from individual planting belongs to the individual," and strengthen the political and ideological education of the broad masses of staff and workers, resolutely overcome the fear of trouble and disdain for small quantities. Adopt a variety of purchasing methods, organizing purchasing points or agency points centered on canteens, to facilitate sales by the masses.

4.  While harvesting and selling farm-grown oilseeds, all localities should mobilize the masses to do a good job in collecting and selling wild oilseeds, increasing oil sources for the country and wealth for society. When collecting wild oilseeds, attention should be paid to protecting the plants, without harming the old roots, so that they can continue to reproduce.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Since the beginning of autumn, castor, sunflower and other oil crops planted by various localities using fragmented idle land have gradually matured. To ensure a bumper harvest, many people's communes, while vigorously developing grain production, have conscientiously organized forces to further strengthen the late-stage management of castor and sunflower. Some areas with earlier maturity have begun to organize forces to harvest and sell to the state.

Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, which initiated the campaign to plant minor oil crops nationwide this spring, has conscientiously implemented the spirit of grasping production from planting to harvest, and vigorously strengthened the late-stage management of castor. All communes have adopted methods of contracting output, contracting land, contracting picking and threshing, setting tasks, assigning personnel, setting work points, and setting rewards and punishments to ensure that the task is overfulfilled. At present, the county has organized more than 7,000 people to establish professional teams to actively carry out harvesting and sales. Yucheng County, Henan Province, as early as mid-July, comprehensively deployed the management, harvesting, and sales of minor oilseeds such as castor and sunflower, and put forward the slogan "Minor oilseeds will not be harvested completely, management will not be idle." More than 290 professional teams in the county have strengthened the care of castor, and some early-maturing areas have begun harvesting, and the amount of castor purchased throughout the county has greatly increased compared with the same period last year. The Communist Youth League Committee of Huairou County, Beijing, organized nearly 30,000 primary and secondary school students in the county to participate in the management, harvesting, and sales of castor and sunflower. The survival rate of castor and sunflower in the county reached about 70%. At present, the harvesting and purchasing of castor have begun.

In many areas, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, the grain, commerce, agriculture, and forestry departments jointly organized oilseed purchase headquarters to promptly supervise and inspect the harvesting and purchasing of minor oilseeds such as castor and sunflower, and deeply publicized to the broad masses the policy that the income from collective planting belongs to the collective and the income from individual planting belongs to the individual. Many areas have increased the number of purchasing points to facilitate sales by the masses. In addition to setting up 142 purchasing points, Jiaohe County, Hebei, also sent purchasing personnel to go deep into production teams or units planting minor oilseeds to purchase, so that the masses can sell without leaving their own units. Qihe County, Shandong Province, has set up a total of 105 purchasing points, and more than 1,000 grain management units and commercial supply and marketing departments affiliated to each basic accounting unit are responsible for purchasing, basically ensuring that where there are masses selling, there are people purchasing.

    中央五个部和团中央联合通知各地
    积极采摘和交售家生、野生油料
    各地组织力量加强蓖麻向日葵后期管理和采摘收购工作
    新华社30日讯　粮食部、农业部、林业部、商业部、教育部和共青团中央最近联合发出通知，号召所属单位发动群众开展一个采摘、交售蓖麻籽、葵花籽和其他小宗油料、野生油料的群众运动。
    通知说，目前，各地播种的蓖麻、向日葵已经陆续成熟，核桃和榛子即将采摘。为了确保丰产丰收，进一步鼓舞广大群众对油料生产的积极性，促进油料生产的高速度发展，各地应该根据从种到收一抓到底的精神，坚持政治挂帅，动员广大群众，大搞部门协作，及时抓紧抓好蓖麻、向日葵和其它小宗油料的后期管理和组织采摘、交售工作。
    通知中对于如何做好这项工作提出了几点意见：
    一、根据蓖麻、向日葵生长的具体情况，各地要立即采取有效措施，保证将这些作物管好、收好、交售好。早熟地区要及时采摘，做到成熟一片，收摘一片；零星种植的要做到成熟一株，收一株，一面收摘，一面组织交售入库。成熟较晚的地区，要继续加强后期管理，防止可能发生的损失。
    二、必须在党委领导下，统一规划，全面安排劳动力，紧密结合当地中心工作，见缝插针，动员广大青少年利用一切空闲时间进行采摘。同时要把公社社员、干部、工人、部队、城镇居民充分地发动起来，掀起采摘和组织交售蓖麻籽、葵花籽的高潮。广大青少年要像种植的时候一样，在运动中继续成为后期管理、采摘和交售的突击手，同时又是出色的宣传员。
    三、粮食部门和商业部门应当认真做好收购和留种工作。特别要大力贯彻执行“集体种植的收益归集体所有，个人种植的收益归个人所有”的政策，并加强对广大职工的政治思想教育，坚决克服怕麻烦、嫌零星的思想。采取多种多样的收购方法，以食堂为中心组织收购点或代购点，便利群众交售。
    四、在采摘、交售家生油料的同时，各地应当发动群众，做好野生油料的采集、交售工作，为国家增加油源，为社会增加财富。在采摘野生油料时，要注意保护植株，不伤老根，使它们能够继续繁殖。
    新华社30日讯　入秋以来，各地利用零星空闲地种植的蓖麻、向日葵等油料作物已经陆续成熟，为了确保丰产丰收，很多地区的人民公社在大办粮食的同时，认真地组织力量，进一步加强对蓖麻、向日葵的后期管理，有些成熟较早的地区已开始组织力量进行采摘和向国家交售。
    今年春季曾向全国倡议开展种植小油料作物运动的山东省平原县，认真贯彻从种到收一抓到底的精神，大力加强了蓖麻的后期管理工作。各公社都采取包产量、包地段、包摘拾脱粒，定任务、定人员、定工分、定奖惩的办法，保证超额完成任务。目前全县已组织七千多人建立专业队，积极进行采摘和交售。河南省虞城县早在7月中旬，就全面部署了蓖麻、向日葵等小油料的管理和采摘、交售工作，提出了“小油料不收完，管理不停闲”的口号。全县有二百九十多个专业队加强对蓖麻的护理，部分早熟地区已开始采摘，全县收购的蓖麻比去年同期大大增加。共青团北京市怀柔县委组织全县中小学生将近三万人，投入了蓖麻、向日葵的管理和采摘、交售运动，全县蓖麻、向日葵的成活率达70％左右，目前已开始收摘和收购蓖麻。
    许多地区在党委的统一领导下，由粮食、商业、农业、林业部门等共同组织油料收购指挥部，及时督促检查做好蓖麻、向日葵等小油料的采摘、收购工作，并向广大群众深入宣传了集体种植的收益归集体，个人种植的收益归个人的政策。不少地区增加了收购点，便利群众交售。河北交河县除了设立一百四十二个收购点外，还派出采购人员深入生产队或种植小油料的单位收购，使群众不出本单位就可以出售。山东省齐河县共设立一百零五个收购点，各基本核算单位所属的粮食管理单位和商业部门的供销门市部一千多处都负责收购工作，基本上做到那里有群众交售，那里就有人收购。
