Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th August: Party committees at all levels in Chongqing are vigorously grasping the work of urban public canteens, conscientiously implementing the policy of running canteens diligently and frugally, and taking the running of public canteens well and further meticulously arranging the people's economic life as a current political task.

In leading the running of canteens, party committees at all levels have consistently implemented the policy of diligence and frugality, enabling the people to eat better, eat their fill, and save money by eating in the canteen compared to eating at home. At the beginning of the operation, the commune party committees carried out education on diligence and frugality among the canteen staff, and mobilized the staff to establish various systems, so that everyone was responsible for everything, and attention was paid to planned expenditures everywhere, so as to save unnecessary expenses in the canteen as much as possible, in order to reduce the burden on the masses. Recently, the street communes have given full play to the superiority of the commune's large-scale and public nature, and rapidly established 48 main and non-staple food processing factories based on the large canteens, to process rice, pasta, etc. for the medium and small public canteens. Because the main and non-staple food processing factories have already been steamed and some cooking utensils have been mechanized, it is easier to promote advanced steaming methods, advanced coal burning methods, and save manpower, which can save more grain, fuel, and reduce canteen expenses.

The urban people's commune party committees also tried to save canteen staff and reduce expenses by improving labor organization and innovating cooking utensils. None of the 31 public canteens in Chaotianmen have set up special administrators or accountants. Under the principle of serving production and facilitating the masses, the Chaotianmen Commune Party Committee adopted the method of centralized management, separate accounting, and each being responsible for its own profits and losses, and established a finance and accounting team to centrally manage the canteen's daily procurement, ticket sales, financial accounting and other work. The implementation of this method not only reduced the canteen's administrative work, but also reduced the number of staff by 42 compared with decentralized management, and made it easier for the cooks to concentrate on improving the quality of food. After this canteen management experience was promoted throughout the city, the expenses of many canteens were reduced, and the masses ate better than at home, and the monthly food expenses were lower than at home.

The second important task for Chongqing to run public canteens well is to carry out mass non-staple food production activities centered on the canteen, and adopt the method of "growing and eating their own, breeding and raising their own" to grow vegetables and raise pigs. At present, public canteens in various units have raised more than 50,000 pigs, planted more than 16,000 mu of vegetables, and raised more than 200,000 poultry. Among the 364 units in Shapingba District, 81% of the units have planted vegetables. Many large factories and mines with open space have assigned vegetable plots to commune canteens, and contracted for planting vegetables and raising pigs; factories and mines with little or no open space have joined forces to reclaim wasteland in the suburbs to set up farms.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th August: The Guang'anmenwai People's Commune in Beijing runs the commune diligently and frugally, and uses the spirit of hard work, self-reliance to handle affairs, so that the commune's production and welfare undertakings are developing more rapidly.

The commune's production has developed rapidly, and income has increased month by month. However, whether it is commune-run factories, canteens, nurseries, or service stations, all insist on the principle of simplicity on the premise of ensuring safety and hygiene. If anything needs to be added, the first thing is to mobilize the masses to solve it themselves, rather than relying on others. Therefore, many things are done quickly, effectively, and with little money.

The commune has established a set of financial management systems, stipulating that more than 90% of the commune's expenditures must be used for expanded reproduction, and stipulating the approval authority for various expenditures. In terms of expenditure system, the commune leaders have always emphasized that what can be bought or not bought should not be bought. Due to the adherence to the above principles and systems, the actual office expenses of the commune each month are much less than the prescribed amount. Even the expenses used for adding equipment and expanding reproduction, they do not buy whatever they want. A large part of the equipment is still solved by themselves. For example, when building a stone powder factory, a large shaft was needed to install the millstone. According to the commune's existing production capacity, it could not be solved. However, Zhang Shun, the first secretary of the commune party committee, who was affectionately called "Master Zhang" by the commune members, personally took action and worked with the workers of the metal processing factory to painstakingly study and connect two small machine tools together, and finally produced a large shaft that was much longer than the machine tool.

The reason why this commune is thrifty is mainly because the commune party committee has consistently adhered to the policy of diligence and frugality, and has continuously carried out education on diligence and frugality to cadres and production service personnel. In the second half of last year, under the circumstances that the commune's production developed and the tasks increased, a small number of people in the sewing factory and other units did not actively explore production potential, but instead believed that increasing production tasks required increasing factory buildings and machines, and simply asked the higher authorities for money. In response to this situation, the party committee decided to discuss the production tasks ideologically first. As a result of this long-term persistence, the sewing factory and other units, which originally shouted that they could not complete the tasks without adding equipment, overfulfilled the tasks through hard work.

Now, the commune has established 14 factories, and production is developing rapidly. The variety of products alone has increased from 90 last year to more than 140 now, including stone powder, coke, screws and other products and civilian hardware processed and produced for large factories. The metal processing factory, which started with a broken oven and two hammers, can now produce nearly 80 kinds of products. The welfare undertakings of the commune members have also developed rapidly. The canteens, nurseries, service stations, etc., built simply, are all over the corners of the commune, as well as bathhouses and barbershops. (Attached picture)

    重庆各级党委大抓食堂开源节流工作使社员吃得又好又省
    北京广安门外公社坚持因陋就简原则创办和发展各项事业
    据新华社重庆9日电　重庆各级党委大抓城市公共食堂工作，认真贯彻勤俭办食堂的方针，把办好公共食堂、进一步细致地安排好人民经济生活，作为当前的一项政治任务。
    各级党委在领导办食堂中，自始至终贯彻勤俭节约办事的方针，使人民群众在食堂搭伙比在家里吃得好、吃得饱而又省钱。在开办之初，各公社党委就在食堂工作人员中开展勤俭节约的教育，并发动工作人员建立各种制度，做到事事有人负责，处处讲究计划开支，尽量省掉食堂不必要的开支，以减轻群众的费用。最近各街道公社充分发挥了公社一大二公的优越性，以大食堂为基点迅速建立了四十八个主副食品加工厂，为中、小型公共食堂加工米饭、面食等。由于主副食品加工厂已经蒸气化和部分炊具机械化，更便于推广先进蒸饭法、先进烧煤法和节约人力，能够更多节约粮食、燃料和减少食堂费用。
    各城市人民公社党委还通过改善劳动组织、炊具革新等方面，尽量节约公共食堂工作人员，减少费用开支。朝天门三十一个公共食堂都没有专门设管理员、会计员等。在为生产服务、方便群众的原则下，朝天门公社党委采取集中管理，分别核算，各负盈亏办法，成立了财会组，集中管理食堂日常采购、售票、财务会计等工作。实行这个办法后，不仅减轻了食堂的事务工作，比分散管理时减少了四十二个工作人员，并且便于炊事人员集中精力提高饭菜质量。全市推广了这种食堂管理经验以后，许多食堂的费用减少，群众比在家里吃得好，而每月伙食开支比在家里要低。
    重庆市办好公共食堂的第二项重要工作，是以食堂为中心开展群众性的副食品生产运动，采取“自种自食，自繁自养”办法大种蔬菜，大养其猪。现在，各单位公共食堂已养猪五万多头，种菜一万六千多亩，养家禽二十万多只。沙坪坝区三百六十四个单位中，有81％的单位种了菜。许多有空地的大型厂矿把菜地划给公社食堂，分片包干种菜养猪；没有空地或空地少的厂矿，便联合到市郊开垦荒地办农场。
    据新华社9日讯　北京市广安门外人民公社勤俭办社，用实干苦干、自力更生的精神办事，使公社生产和福利事业更加迅速发展。
    这个公社的生产发展很快，收入月月增加。但是不论社办工厂、食堂、托儿所、服务站，都是在保证安全、卫生的前提下，坚持因陋就简的原则，需要增添什么，首先是发动群众自己动手解决，而不是依赖别人，因此许多事都办得时间短、效果快、花钱少。
    公社建立了一套财务管理制度，规定公社90％以上的开支必须用在扩大再生产上，并规定了各项开支的审批权限。在开支制度方面，公社领导干部一贯强调可买可不买的不买。由于坚持了以上原则和制度，公社每月实际开支的办公费用，比规定的数目要少得多。即使是用于添置设备扩大再生产的费用，他们也不是要什么就买什么，一大部分设备仍然靠自己解决。如建设石粉厂时安装碾子需要大轴，按照公社的现有生产能力没法解决，但是被社员们亲切地称为“张师傅”的公社党委第一书记张顺，亲自动手，和金属加工厂的工人一起苦心钻研，把两个小机床接在一起，终于生产出了比机床长得多的大轴。
    这个公社所以勤俭成风，主要是公社党委一贯坚持勤俭办社的方针，不断向干部和生产服务人员进行了勤俭办社的教育。去年下半年，在公社生产发展、任务增加的情况下，缝纫厂等少部分人不积极挖掘生产潜力，反而认为要增加生产任务就要增加厂房、机器，单纯向上级伸手要钱。党委针对这种情况，决定每次讨论生产任务以前先务务虚。这样长期坚持的结果，本来叫喊不添设备完不成任务的缝纫厂等单位，经过实干苦干，都超额完成了任务。
    现在，这个公社已办起了十四个工厂，生产发展很快，光是产品品种就由去年的九十种增加到现在的一百四十多种，包括为大工厂加工生产的石粉、焦炭、螺丝等产品和民用小五金等。一个破烘炉两把锤子起家的金属加工厂，现在已能生产近八十种产品。社员的福利事业也发展很快，因陋就简建立起来的食堂、托儿所、服务站等，布满公社的各个角落，还有洗澡塘和理发馆等。（附图片）
