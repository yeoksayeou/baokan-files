Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, August 27th: An Chengxiang, praised as the Xu Xuehui of Guizhou for her ardent loyalty and selfless protection of grain, has made remarkable achievements in her work at the commune canteen after recovering from her injuries. She is doing everything possible to ensure the food supply for the commune members and serving agricultural production. The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League recently conferred upon her the honorary title of Socialist Construction Red Banner Pacesetter.

An Chengxiang is a cook at the Shuikousi Canteen of the Qinggangpo Commune in Sinan County. In February of this year, in order to protect collective property, she fought bravely alone against unlawful landlord elements who were sabotaging the people's commune. Despite suffering nine knife wounds, she persisted in the struggle, ensuring that collective wealth was not lost. Under the care of the Party and the masses, she quickly recovered her health and returned to her beloved work post.

As soon as An Chengxiang returned to the canteen, she immediately joined in the work. In order to ensure that commune members eat better and more economically, she often solicits their opinions on the food and further studies and learns cooking techniques, even going to the Jieshang Canteen of the Yonghe Commune in neighboring Meitan County to learn the techniques of making pasta, steaming buns and vegetable buns for the commune members. The commune members praised her with satisfaction as a "good housekeeper."

    安成香伤愈后工作出色
    贵州团省委授予红旗手光荣称号
    新华社贵阳27日电　以赤胆忠心、舍身护粮被誉为贵州徐学惠的安成香，伤愈回到公社食堂工作岗位后，千方百计做好社员们的饮食供应工作，为农业生产服务，作出了显著成绩。共青团贵州省委最近授予她社会主义建设红旗手的光荣称号。
    安成香是思南县青杠坡公社水口寺食堂的炊事员。今年2月，她为了保卫集体财产，只身同破坏人民公社的不法地主分子进行搏斗，身负九处刀伤仍坚持斗争，保证集体财富未受任何损失。在党和群众的关怀下，她很快恢复了健康，回到自己热爱的工作岗位。
    安成香一回到食堂，立即参加了工作。为了使社员们吃得更好更省，她经常征求社员对饭菜的意见，进一步研究、学习做饭菜的技术，甚至到邻近的湄潭县永和公社街上食堂学习做面食的技术，给社员蒸馒头、菜包子。社员们满意地夸她是“好管家”。
