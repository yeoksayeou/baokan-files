Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 20th: The Soviet government has issued a statement on the current situation in the Republic of the Congo. The statement emphasizes that the threat to universal peace caused in the Congo region has not been eliminated. Imperialist aggression against the Congo continues, albeit in a changed form.

The statement specifically points out that recently, various American "experts," primarily military experts, have come to the Congo under the guise of United Nations experts. The arrival of American military experts in this form is clearly an attempt to transform the failed Belgian intervention into an American intervention disguised under the flag of the United Nations. The statement emphasizes that the criminal acts of aggression against the independent Republic of the Congo, its territorial integrity, and its sovereignty must be stopped immediately and unconditionally.

The statement says that the Soviet government hopes that the Security Council will strictly implement the resolutions it has adopted and carry the matter of stopping the aggression against the Republic of the Congo through to the end. The Soviet government fully supports the Congolese government's demand that neutral countries immediately send observers to the Congo. The statement points out that if the aggressors do not withdraw from the Republic of the Congo and do not abandon their plans to divide it, then peace-loving countries will find it necessary to take other steps, in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the Security Council, to stop the acts of aggression.

    就目前刚果局势
    苏联政府发表声明
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：苏联政府就刚果共和国目前的局势发表了声明。声明中着重指出，在刚果地区造成的对普遍和平的威胁并没有消除。帝国主义对刚果的侵略仍然在继续进行，只不过是改变了方式而已。
    声明中特别指出，最近，美国的各种“专家”，首先是军事专家在联合国专家的幌子下来到刚果。美国军事专家借用这种形式来到刚果显然是企图把遭到失败的比利时干涉变成用联合国的旗帜作掩饰的美国的干涉。声明中着重指出，对独立的刚果共和国以及对它的领土完整和主权所进行的罪恶侵略活动必须立即、无条件地停止。
    声明中说，苏联政府希望，安理会将会严格执行它所通过的决议并把制止对刚果共和国的侵略一事进行到底。苏联政府完全支持刚果政府要求中立国家立即派遣观察员到刚果去的要求。声明中指出，如果侵略者不撤出刚果共和国和不放弃分裂它的计划的话，那么，爱好和平的国家将有必要根据安理会通过的决议采取其他步骤来制止侵略行动。
