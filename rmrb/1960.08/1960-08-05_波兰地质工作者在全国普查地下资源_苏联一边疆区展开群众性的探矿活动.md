    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 30th: Polish geologists, following a decision by the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, are conducting a nationwide survey of underground resources. They have already determined that, in addition to abundant coal reserves, Poland possesses 100 million tons of pure sulfur. Pure copper reserves amount to 10 million tons. Preliminary surveys in Bialystok Province indicate that the region not only contains iron ore but may also hold valuable rare metals and other metal ores.

    Oil exploration is concentrated in southeastern Poland, with continued exploration in existing oil-bearing areas of the Carpathian region. Geological surveys in the northwestern region have also been expanded. These surveys suggest the potential for abundant oil and natural gas reserves.

    The natural gas industry is a newly established sector in Poland. Recently, it was discovered that the Lubaczow region of Rzeszow Province holds 90 billion cubic meters of natural gas reserves. Proven reserves of this natural fuel amount to 400 billion cubic meters. Extensive efforts are underway domestically to establish natural gas extraction sites. To transport natural gas to industrial centers, natural gas pipelines are being laid. The pipeline from Lubaczow to Tarnow has already been completed. There are also plans to lay a natural gas pipeline from Lubaczow to Warsaw. By 1965, Poland will extract one billion cubic meters of natural gas, half of which will be used for chemical processing industries.

    Xinhua News Agency, Vladivostok, 27th: According to TASS, a mass geological prospecting campaign has recently begun in the Primorsky Krai of the Soviet Far East. Approximately 10,000 volunteer hunting and hiking enthusiasts have entered the Sikhote-Alin mountain range to prospect for minerals.

    During the preparation for this campaign, 200 groups were organized in various enterprises, institutions, research institutes, and schools to study field geology and prospecting methods.

    The first mass prospecting campaign was organized last year. Approximately 8,000 people participated at that time, forming 500 teams. They discovered new deposits of brown coal and phosphate rock, as well as some mica outcrops.

    波兰地质工作者在全国普查地下资源
    苏联一边疆区展开群众性的探矿活动
    新华社华沙30日电　波兰地质工作者根据波兰统一工人党中央的决定，正在全国展开地下资源的勘探工作。他们已经查明，除去蕴藏丰富的煤炭以外，波兰纯硫的蕴藏量达一亿吨。纯铜的蕴藏量达一千万吨。在比亚里斯多克省进行的初步勘察表明，这里不但蕴藏着铁矿，而且还可能有贵重的稀有金属和其他金属矿。
    石油的勘探工作集中在波兰东南部，同时还在喀尔巴阡地区原有的含油区进行勘察。对西北地区的地质勘察工作也已扩大。勘察表明，这里可能有丰富的石油和天然气。
    天然气工业是波兰新建立的工业部门。最近发现，热舒夫省的路巴丘夫的天然气储量达九百亿立方米。已经发现的这种天然燃料为四千亿立方米。目前国内正在广泛展开建立天然气开采场的工作。为了把天然气输送到工业中心，正在敷设天然气管道。从路巴丘夫到塔尔诺夫的管道已经建成。还计划敷设从路巴丘夫到华沙的天然气管道。到1965年，波兰将开采十亿立方米的天然气，其中的一半将用于化学加工工业。
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社海参崴讯：苏联远东滨海边疆区最近开始了一个群众性地质勘探活动。约一万名自愿参加的打猎和旅行爱好者进入了希霍特阿林山区去探矿。
    在这次活动准备期间，在各企业、机关、研究所和学校中组织了二百个小组，学习野外地质、探矿方法等。
    第一次群众性探矿活动是在去年组织的。当时约有八千人参加，组成了五百个小队。他们发现了一些新的褐煤和磷钙石矿床，以及一些云母露头。
