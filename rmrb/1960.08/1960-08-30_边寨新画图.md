　　Kale New Village

　　Here is the Kale Village, a new Zhuang village nestled among the white clouds – in Mubian County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

　　Speaking of Kale, people can't help but raise their eyebrows high, highlighting the deepest joy in their hearts. Because it stands on the precipitous and towering mountain top, bathed in sunlight, with flowing springs…

　　Yes! When the sun rises, the wind carrying the fragrance of star anise welcomes us from the newly built threshing ground, from the stone-paved path strung with kumquats and tangerines… Walking into the village is more captivating than entering a colorful gallery. The Leap Forward gate woven from pine needles stands across the village entrance, covered with various flower garlands; the words written on it "Long Live the People's Commune!" "Long Live the Great Leap Forward!" blend with all the heat and light of the sun, pouring out the happiness of this place to the people.

　　Everything shining here is so beautiful and charming. We are so fascinated by it.

　　Isn't it? Before we came, we heard the Party Secretary of the commune say: "Kale is a new painting on the frontier!" This is absolutely correct. You should know that Kale used to be a remote small village that people rarely visited, and guests rarely came. Now, it has become a blooming red kapok flower on the border.

　　Speaking of this, we can't help but think of old carpenter Li Er Grandpa, because he is one of the main figures who skillfully dressed up this new village.

　　It was last spring, the first spring after the establishment of the People's Commune.

　　During the day, the commune members worked enthusiastically on the newly reclaimed land, and at night they sat around the fire pit to discuss and formulate the Leap Forward plan for the Zhuang people.

　　In the midst of this series of busy days, Li Er Grandpa, this energetic and strong-willed little old man, found the Party Branch Secretary in a field and spoke of his long-cherished plan.

　　"Secretary!" He pursed his little mustache: "You might think I'm being long-winded, but I have to say what's on my mind!"

　　"What is it, tell me, Li Er Grandpa."

　　"This is what I'm thinking: The Zhuang people moved here from Yunnan, practicing slash-and-burn farming. For generations, we've been hoping and waiting, but we haven't built a good village. Now that we have communization, we stand taller and straighter, but we can't keep living in a thatched hut made of reeds!"

　　"What's your plan, Li Er Grandpa?"

　　"I say renovate, according to what our ancestors have been hoping for."

　　"Good, Li Er Grandpa!" The Party Branch Secretary grabbed the old man's hand: "The commune is also discussing this matter. However, the most important thing right now is production!" Saying this, he took Li Er Grandpa to the brigade headquarters and showed him a design drawing, saying: "This is the commune's preliminary plan. In the future, we will build our new village beautifully on the premise of stepping up production…"

　　This made the old man very happy. In order to welcome everything he had been longing for, he worked tirelessly, like everyone else in the village, from dawn till dusk. Whether it was firing bricks and tiles, felling trees and transporting stones, he was like a wild goose spreading its wings, flying across the high mountains and ridges, shuttling through the deep forests. In particular, his drill and saw, shining brightly, never left his strong hands.

　　Time passed day by day. Under the call of a comprehensive and continuous Great Leap Forward, Kale Village's agriculture in 1959 increased by more than double compared to 1958; and new houses were built in the depths of the white clouds, surrounded by green mountains.

　　The old man's craftsmanship is really good. He led his assistants, taking time today to carve a pair of phoenix spreading their wings on the doors and windows of this new house, and tomorrow carving a pair of peacocks spreading their tails on the tables and chairs of that house; and the latticed walls of the public canteen are even filled with magpies, thrushes, and skylarks… all of which symbolize the days of the Zhuang people being sweeter than honey.

　　Under such circumstances, who wouldn't praise the old man from the bottom of their hearts: "Li Er Grandpa, you are truly a pair of ingenious hands!" Li Er Grandpa usually grinned with his toothless mouth: "Hehe, ingenuity is enlightened by Chairman Mao. It is because the Zhuang people have such good days today…" His words are like the flowing stream, light, fast, and sweet.

　　Accompanied by the Party Branch Secretary, we walked past the granaries filled with golden grains, and past the club where music and songs never stopped. When we heard the secretary talk excitedly about the future plans of Kale New Village to build hydropower stations, etc., we were even more uncontrollably happy.

　　"Secretary, does Kale Village have schools and factories?" we asked.

　　"How could we be without them! Look." The Party Branch Secretary pointed a big hand out the window. Among the green trees, there were a few pillars of green smoke and a few bright red flags fluttering in the wind.

　　Just as we were talking, a drizzle suddenly drifted from the surrounding camellia forests. It seemed to be sweeping away the dust for the new village, washing Kale Village so that the red was redder, and the green was greener… The soft and even tone was simply a flower bed in full spring.

　　We were even more encouraged, and our excited hearts could not calm down for a long time. I said in my heart: "Kale, you are so beautiful…" Just as I thought of this, I saw Li Er Grandpa stepping on a ladder again, waving a drill, carving a "Communist Classroom" lintel on a newly renovated big house not far away.

　　Unusual Dance Party

　　At noon, the sun smiled in the clouds, the birds sang, and the cicadas played their strings. At this time, Kale Village seemed to be covered with a layer of soft golden gauze. Look, the mountains that embrace it, how green and lush! Those star anise forests emitting a peculiar fragrance, and the straight-standing winter melon trees, are like embroidered green velvet shawls, surrounding each of its houses, covering each of its small windows, stairs, threshing grounds, and stone-paved paths with copper-green spots.

　　Usually, the people in the village might still be busy in the fields, but not today. Their hearts seemed to be filled with a handful of honey, excitedly, sweetly, from the brigade headquarters to the commune members' homes, everywhere you could see happy smiling faces, and their busy figures. Especially the two bronze drums hanging in the club, were being beaten by the young men with a intoxicating rhythm.

　　What is all this for! The annual Jumping Festival has just passed; the big February festival next year has not yet arrived. According to the rules of the Zhuang people, there is nothing to gather for right now!

　　We went to ask the Party Branch Secretary of the brigade:

　　"Secretary, is there any happy event today?"

　　"Yes, we are going to dance."

　　"Dance?"

　　"Yes! Kale Village has had another good harvest of early rice, and we are going to deliver the first batch of Leap Forward grain for 1960!"

　　These words, like a heat wave, poured into our hearts. We thought: The fields are opened on the top of the mountains, and everything is so difficult! I remember when I came here some time ago, all I saw from top to bottom was a pile of green, but now, it has turned into countless bushels of gold. How much hard work and joy of harvest is contained in this!

　　A picture of vigorously promoting the continuous leap forward in the mountainous area suddenly turned in our hearts like a revolving lantern. We saw: The Party Branch Secretary planted a bright red flag of a good start on the opposite White Snake Ridge. At that time, the Zhuang commune members shook the mountains with their feet and carried the white clouds on their shoulders. That piece of flowing water in the rice paddies, their diligent hands splashed out a different rice green than in previous years; we saw: The brigade leader led the entire youth commando team, eating in the fields and sleeping in the fields. The wind and rain blew away their work sheds, but they straightened their waists and became more like a group of brave and agile swallows. In order not to let a single rice seedling fall, they flew back and forth day and night. We saw: The rice was ripe, and the mountains and ridges were all golden. It was said that this should be reassuring, but it was not like that. They were afraid of drought during the grouting period, so they launched a movement to bring water up the mountain. At that time, how many suns were lit by their bonfires, and how many moons were shamed down by their lamps. We saw…

　　These are the most beautiful songs, leading us to the most beautiful realm. Yes! On the road of a greater leap forward, they are so youthful and radiant.

　　In order to express our congratulations, we decided to spend this joyous moment with them. Look! The Zhuang girls are coming from the shade of the trees full of camellia fruit, from the small fences covered with velvet beans. They are wearing blue headscarves and white tops embroidered with lace; the silver rings and bead chains inlaid on their chests, reflecting each other, are like joyful peacocks, spreading their wings and surrounding us.

　　Just as everyone was watching intently, a young and lively young man first pulled out his Lajieqin and jumped into the dance floor.

　　"Come on! Guests and girls, let's dance!"

　　In this way, the bronze drum was struck, and a series of rhythmically beautiful steps began. People are like the cuckoos in spring, singing of the richness and splendor of this remote and high-altitude mountain village; their hearts are more beautiful than flowers.

　　We were dancing and dancing with abandon. A grain delivery team composed of dozens of people, like soldiers about to go on an expedition, was full of people's enthusiasm and entrustment. It was about to set off, and people danced even more happily. At this time, I couldn't help but think sweetly: Motherland, how happy are the people of all ethnic groups growing up in your arms! And how ambitious! They listened to your words, turning poor mountain villages into rich villages, they…

    边寨新画图
    毛正三
    卡列新村
    这里是嵌在白云之间的倮寨新村——广西僮族自治区睦边县的卡列村。
    说到卡列，人们总不免把眉尖高高挑起，挑出心根上最深情的欢乐。因为，它在这峭然峻拔的大山顶上，浴着阳光，飞着流泉……
    是啊！太阳升起时，飘溢着八角香味的风，从新搭的晒谷台上迎接着我们，从串满金橘柑果的石砌小路上迎接着我们……我们走到村上，比进入了一个五彩缤纷的画廊还要迷人。那用松针织成的跃进门，横在村口，挂满了各种各样的花串；那写在上面的“人民公社万岁！”“大跃进万岁！”溶和着太阳的全部光热，向人们倾吐着这里的幸福。
    这里闪光的一切，是那样绮丽迷人。我们太为它神往了。
    不是吗？在我们没来之前，就听公社的党委书记说：“卡列，可是边疆上的一幅新画啊！”这话一点不错，要知道，过去的卡列，是人不常到，客不常来的一个僻远的小村子，而现在，变成了怒放在边疆上的一朵红棉。
    提起这些，我们不能不想起老木工黎二爷爷，因为他是为这新村巧装打扮的主要人物之一。
    那是去年的春天，人民公社成立后的第一个春天。
    社员们白天热火朝天地工作在新垦的土地上，夜晚就围坐在火塘一旁，讨论、订制倮家的跃进计划。
    就在这一串繁忙的日子里，黎二爷爷，这个浑身是劲，性格好强的小老头子，把党支部书记找到一个田头上，说出了自己多年实现不了的打算。
    “支书！”他小胡子一抿：“说起来你又嫌我唠叨，可我的话，不说不行啊！”
    “什么事，你说吧，黎二爷爷。”
    “我是这样想：倮家从云南迁到这里，刀耕火种，几辈子盼星星，望月亮，没建起一个好的村寨，眼下公社化了，我们的腰杆越挺越直了，可自己住的，总不能老是一把茅草加芦苇吧！”
    “你的打算呢？黎二爷爷。”
    “我说翻新，按我们祖祖辈辈盼的那样。”
    “好啊！黎二爷爷。”党支部书记一把抓住了老人家的手：“社里也正在合计这件事，不过，眼下最紧要的，还是闹生产哦！”说着，把黎二爷爷带到大队部里，将一张设计图展现在他的面前说：“这是社里初步的计划。往后，我们就来个在加紧生产前提下，美美地建设我们的新村……。”
    这可喜坏了他老人家，他为了迎接渴望的一切，和全村的人一样，披星戴月，废寝忘食，不倦地工作起来。不论烧砖烧瓦，伐木运石，总像一只展开翅膀的大雁，飞驰在高山大岭，穿梭在深山老林，特别是他的钻刀、刨锯，亮闪闪的从没有离开过他那刚劲的手。
    时间一天一天地过去，卡列村1959年的农业，在全面继续大跃进的号召下，比1958年增产了一倍多；而一幢幢崭新的房舍，在白云深处，绿山环绕中建立起来。
    老人家的手艺真巧，他带领着自己的助手，今天抽空给这一座新房雕一双凤凰展翅的门窗，明天又给那一座琢一对孔雀开屏的桌椅；而公共食堂的透花板壁上，更刻满了喜鹊、画眉、百灵鸟……，这一切象征着倮家比蜜还甜的日子。
    在这种情况下，谁不从心眼里称赞他老人家呢：“黎二爷爷，你真是双巧夺天工的好手！”黎二爷爷却通常是把没牙的嘴巴一咧：“嘻嘻，心灵手巧，是毛主席开导的，是因为倮家有了今天的好日子……。”他的话，就像那小溪的流水，轻快而又清甜。
    我们在党支部书记的陪同下，从堆满金颗玉粒的粮仓走过，从笙歌不断的俱乐部走过，当听到支书兴冲冲地谈到卡列新村不久的将来就要建设水电站等远景时，更有些乐得不可抑制了。
    “支书，卡列村有学校和工厂吗？”我们问。
    “这还能少了！喏。”党支部书记的大手向窗外一指。万绿丛中，有几柱翠蓝的烟缕和几面鲜艳的红旗，在迎风飘荡。
    正说着。一阵细雨，突然从周围的油茶林里飘洒而来。它好像在为新村洒扫风尘，把个卡列村洗涤得红是红，绿是绿……那柔和匀均的色调，简直是一片盛春的花坛。
    我们更加鼓舞了，激动的心，经久不能平息。我心里在说：“卡列，你太美了，……。”刚想到这里，只见黎二爷爷又踏着架梯，挥着钻刀，在不远的一座刚刚刷新的大房子上，雕出了一个“共产主义课堂”的门楣。
    不寻常的舞会
    中午，太阳在云缝里微笑，鸟儿在唱，蝉在拉着弦子。这时的卡列村，像披上了一层柔软的金纱。你看，环抱着它的群山，多青多绿！那些散发着一股异香的八角林，笔挺笔挺的冬瓜木，又多像绣起的绿绒披肩，簇拥着它的每一座房舍，遮掩着它的每一面小窗、楼梯、晒谷台和石砌的带有铜绿斑点的小路。
    往常，村里的人可能还在田里忙着，今天却不是这样。他们的心窝里，好像塞进了一把蜜糖，兴冲冲的、甜丝丝的，从大队部，到社员的家，到处都可以看见洋溢着幸福的笑脸，和他们繁忙奔走的身影。特别是吊在俱乐部的那两面铜鼓，咚嘡、咚嘡被小伙子们敲得令人迷醉。
    这到底是为了什么啊！一年一度的跳公节刚刚过去；明年的二月大节，还没有到来，按倮倮族的规矩，眼下并没有什么可集会的啊！
    我们去问大队党支部书记：
    “支书，今天有什么喜事吗？”
    “有，要跳舞。”
    “跳舞？”
    “是啊！卡列村的早造，又得到了好收成，要去交1960年的第一号跃进粮呢！”
    这话像一股热流，一下子倾注在我们的心上。我们想：田开在大山顶上，一切多不容易啊！记得前些时到这里来，从上到下，看到的还只是堆叠得一片翠绿，而现在的眼前，却变成了黄金万斗。这里面，蕴藏了多大的辛劳和丰收的喜悦啊！
    一幅在山区大闹继续跃进的画面，顿时像走马灯似地在我们心上转动起来。我们看到：党支部书记将一面开门红的鲜艳大旗，插在对面的白蛇岭上，当时倮家的社员们，脚撼大山，肩荷白云，那一片流水淙淙的田洼里，被他们勤奋的双手，泼出了不同往年的稻绿；我们看到：大队长带领着全体青年突击队员，吃在田头，睡在田头，大风大雨把他们的工棚掀走，可是，他们将腰杆一挺，越发像群勇敢健捷的燕子，为了不让一棵禾苗倒伏，他们日日夜夜地飞来驰去。我们看到：谷子熟了，满山满岭，都成了黄澄澄的，金闪闪的。按说，这应该心安理得了，但，不是这样，他们怕临灌浆时遭到天旱，又展开了引水上山的运动。那时，多少个太阳，被他们的篝火点燃出来，多少个月亮，被他们的灯盏羞落下去。我们看到……
    这些，都是最美的歌，把我们引送到最美的境界。是啊！在更大跃进的道路上，他们多么青春焕发，光彩照人。
    为了表示心里的祝贺，我们决定同他们一起，度过这一可喜的时刻。看吧！倮倮族的姑娘们，从垂满油茶果的树荫下来了，从攀满猫豆秧的小篱边来了，她们头包着蓝汗巾，身穿着绣有花边的白上衣；那嵌在胸前的银环、珠练，交映在一起，简直像一只只欢跃的孔雀，展翅开屏地簇拥在我们面前。
    大家正在出神地看着，一个年青活泼的小伙子，首先拉起了他的拉吉琴，跳进了舞场。
    “来吧！客人和姑娘们，跳舞吧！”
    这样，铜鼓一敲，节奏优美的一串串步影，就此开始了。人们像春天的布谷鸟，把这僻远高寒的山寨，鸣唱得富饶瑰丽；他们的心，比花朵还美。
    我们在纵情地跳着、舞着，几十个人组成的送粮队，像将要出征的战士，满载着人们的热情和嘱托。就要起程了，人们舞得更欢了，这时，我禁不住甜甜地想着：祖国，在你怀抱中生长的各族人民是多么幸福啊！同时又是多么有志气！他们听了你的话，把穷山寨变成富村，他们……。
