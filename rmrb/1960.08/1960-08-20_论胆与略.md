    On Courage and Strategy

    Courage refers to revolutionary courage, revolutionary bravery; strategy refers to revolutionary tactics, countermeasures taken according to the actual situation of the revolutionary object, that is, plans, arrangements, measures, etc. in the work. Courage and strategy are a unity of opposites. They are opposites because courage is not strategy, and strategy is not courage; they each have their own different meanings; they are a unity because the two are interdependent, courage cannot be separated from strategy, and strategy cannot be separated from courage. Good strategy allows revolutionary courage to be built on a solid foundation, and courage and bravery are necessary to truly liberate thinking, be far-sighted, and strategize good countermeasures, plans and measures.

    Among our vast number of cadres, there are many, many people who have both courage and strategy, both bravery and resourcefulness. It is unimaginable that our socialist revolution and socialist construction could have achieved such great achievements without the hard work of the vast number of cadres who have both courage and strategy, both bravery and resourcefulness, and who are both wise and brave. However, there are also some people who have courage without strategy, or strategy without courage, bravery without resourcefulness, or resourcefulness without bravery. Some comrades do not understand that courage and strategy are a unity of opposites. They either think that as long as they have courage, bravery, and drive, they can do without being realistic, without careful planning, and without thinking of measures to solve specific difficulties, or they think that courage, bravery, and drive are all empty things, and passively talk about conditions and emphasize difficulties.

    So, how can we unite courage and strategy and implement them in our actions? Let us first study Hu Suozhong's way of thinking in the process of leading his management area in realizing water conservancy and electrification, and see how he dialectically treats the relationship between courage and strategy.

    Comrade Hu Suozhong does indeed have lofty revolutionary ideals, revolutionary ambition, that is, revolutionary courage and bravery. They are located in the mountains, all of which are "dry mountain slopes," "foot-binding cloth land," and "tofu-block land," and the natural conditions can be described as quite bad. However, in such bad conditions, Hu Suozhong dared to propose a grand plan to realize water conservancy and electrification, and resolutely led the masses to work tirelessly to realize this grand plan, and finally achieved a great victory. This is enough to show how high his revolutionary heroism is, and how great his revolutionary pioneering spirit is. If a person does not have the spirit of despising difficulties strategically, and does not dare to do things that no one has done before, then such a great and arduous task cannot be proposed or undertaken. However, on the other hand, from the fact that Hu Suozhong led the masses to formulate a water conservancy plan, proposing to first work on thirty mu in the first year, and from the fact that he did not give up installing waterwheels at the same time when building a power station to draw water up the mountain, we can also see how careful and prudent he is, how much he pays attention to studying the actual situation, how much he values specific difficulties, and how much he has strategy and methods. It is precisely because Comrade Hu Suozhong's revolutionary courage is built on the basis of a thorough understanding of the actual situation—subjective conditions, objective conditions, favorable conditions, unfavorable conditions, human conditions, and material conditions—rather than relying solely on subjective wishful thinking, that his plans are always so solid, both active and reliable; it is precisely because he firmly believes that people can definitely understand nature and conquer nature, and yet estimates that the things in nature are complex and developing and changing, and that people cannot fully grasp the laws of objective things all at once, that he does not make the plan too tight when arranging work, but leaves room for maneuver, establishes several lines of defense, makes two sets of arrangements, thinks from the worst possible situation, and strives for the best; it is precisely because he despises difficulties in general, and yet values difficulties in specific steps and deals with difficulties seriously, rather than being careless and indifferent, that he can block from the east and block from the west, and is often in a proactive position; in a word, because he tightly combines revolutionary courage and revolutionary strategy, his ambition is both revolutionary and theoretical, and scientific and realistic. Therefore, he has achieved knowing himself and knowing his enemy, and winning every battle. He can truly be called a revolutionary promoter who has both courage and strategy, both bravery and resourcefulness, and is both vigorous and down-to-earth.

    In our actual work, many comrades, from the surface, seem to have revolutionary courage. They are very enthusiastic and have great drive, and they always want to finish tomorrow's work today. It should be said that this subjective wish is very valuable. However, they lack strategy, and they do not understand that courage that is not built on the basis of understanding objective laws and utilizing objective laws is not true courage. Therefore, we must strive to build revolutionary courage on a scientific and realistic basis, and think and plan more before doing things. Especially when taking a major measure, we must not only analyze the favorable conditions and difficult conditions based on the actual situation, and think of ways to overcome the difficulties, but also consider the occurrence of unexpected situations, and consider how to deal with them after the occurrence of unexpected situations, in order to avoid being passive and strive to be proactive. Some people may ask: Isn't this "hesitation" and "fearing the wolf in front and the tiger in the back"? No. This is called "thinking carefully before making a decision," this is called "if you want to fight wolves, you want to fight tigers," you must first "know wolves, know tigers." Studying the situation, grasping the laws, is to study whether the object of our work is a "wolf" or a "tiger," what the nature of the "wolf" is, and what the nature of the "tiger" is, and then make ideological preparations, material preparations, prepare the weapons to fight "wolves" and fight "tigers," organize the team to fight "wolves" and fight "tigers," and then go forward bravely, gather and annihilate them, and achieve victory. Revolutionaries with truly great fearless courage are always so good at scientific analysis and good at making decisions, which is their truly brilliant point. It is precisely because of this brilliance that he has the real courage to not be afraid of any difficulties. The so-called "high skill, great courage" is the same principle.

    In our actual work, there are also some comrades who, on the surface, pay great attention to strategy. They study the conditions and count the difficulties before doing anything, and are careful and cautious, only afraid of messing things up. However, what they lack is precisely revolutionary courage. Revolutionary courage is the premise of revolutionary strategy. Only when we first have revolutionary courage can we see far, think broadly, be intelligent and resourceful, and achieve something. Otherwise, lacking revolutionary courage, being mediocre, and planning来计划去, even if we come up with some methods, they are neither brilliant nor dare to put them into practice, and can only be "armchair strategists." People with truly revolutionary strategy always first regard difficulties as "paper tigers" strategically, and thus despise them and dare to fight them, while in "campaigns" and "battles," they regard difficulties as "real tigers," and thus work hard and practically to fight them, which is their most valuable quality. It is precisely because of this valuable quality that he can have true revolutionary strategy.

    论胆与略
    胆，指的是革命的胆量，革命的勇气；略，指的是革命的谋略，根据革命对象的实际情况所采取的对策，也就是工作中的计划、安排、措施，等等。胆与略是对立的统一。说对立，是因为胆不是略，略不是胆，它们各有自己不同的含义；说统一，是因为两者互相依存，胆离不开略，略离不开胆，有好的谋略才能使革命的胆量建立在坚实的基础上，有胆有勇才能真正解放思想，高瞻远瞩，谋略出好的对策、计划和措施来。
    在我们的广大干部中，有胆有略、有勇有谋的人是很多很多的。我们的社会主义革命、社会主义建设事业之所以能够取得现在这样的伟大成就，离开广大的既有胆又有略，既有勇又有谋，胆略兼备，智勇双全的干部的努力工作，是不可想像的。但是，有胆无略，或者有略无胆，有勇无谋，或者有谋无勇的人，也并不是没有。有些同志不理解胆与略是对立的统一，他们或者以为只要有胆量、有勇气、有干劲，就可以不要实事求是，不要认真谋划，不要想出解决具体困难的措施，或者以为胆量、勇气、干劲这些东西都是空的，而消极地去讲究条件，强调困难。
    那末，怎样才能把胆与略统一起来并贯彻到自己的行动中呢？这里先让我们从胡锁中领导他们管理区在实现水利化、电气化的斗争过程中，来研究一下他的思想方法，来看一看他是如何辩证地对待胆与略的关系的。
    胡锁中同志确实具有远大的革命理想，革命的雄心壮志，也就是具有革命的胆量与勇气。他们那里位于万山丛中，全是“干山坡地”、“裹脚带地”、“豆腐块地”，自然条件可谓相当坏了。然而，在如此坏的条件下，胡锁中却敢于提出实现水利化、电气化的宏伟计划，并且坚决地领导群众为实现这一宏伟计划而不懈地努力，终于获得了伟大胜利。这就足见其革命的英雄气概是如何之高，革命的首创精神是如何之大。假如，一个人没有在战略上蔑视困难的精神，不敢做前人所没有做过的事情，这样伟大、艰巨的任务，他是不能提得出也不能担得起的。可是，反过来从胡锁中领导群众制订水利化计划的时候，提出第一年先搞三十亩的事实中，在为了提水上山而修建电站的时候，又不放弃同时安装水车的事实中，又使我们看出，他是多么细心谨慎，多么注意研究实际情况，多么重视具体困难，多么有谋略、有办法。正因为胡锁中同志的革命胆量，是建立在对实际情况——主观的条件，客观的条件，有利的条件，不利的条件，人的条件，物的条件——熟知的基础上，而不是单凭主观愿望的空想，所以他的计划总是那样扎扎实实，既积极又可靠；正因为他坚信人是一定可以认识自然、战胜自然，而又估计到自然界的事物是复杂的、是发展变化的，人们是不能一下全部掌握客观事物的规律的，所以他在安排工作的时候，就不把盘子打的过紧，而是留有余地，建立几道防线，作出两套安排，从最坏处着想，向最好处努力；正因为他在总的方面蔑视困难，又在具体步骤上重视困难，认真对付困难，而不是粗心大意，满不在乎，所以他就能东来东挡，西来西挡，经常处于主动；一句话，由于他把革命的胆量和革命的谋略紧紧结合在一起，所以他的雄心壮志就既是革命的、理论的，又是科学的、有现实根据的。因此他就作到了知己知彼，百战百胜。真可谓是一个有胆有略，有勇有谋，既轰轰烈烈，又踏踏实实的革命促进派。
    在我们的实际工作中，有很多同志从表面看来，是具有革命的胆量的。他们热情很高，干劲很大，办事情总是想把明天的都拿在今天办完。应该说这种主观愿望是很可贵的。可是他们缺乏谋略，他们不懂得，胆量不是建筑在认识客观规律，利用客观规律的基础上，那就不是真正的胆量。因之必须努力把革命的胆量建筑在科学的、现实基础上，遇事多想一想，多谋一谋。特别在采取一项重大措施的时候，不但要根据现实情况分析有利条件、困难条件，想出克服困难的办法，而且还要考虑到意外情况的发生，考虑到意外情况发生以后怎么对付，以力避被动，力争主动。有人可能会问：这不是“优柔寡断”、“前怕狼，后怕虎”吗？不是。这叫“多谋善断”，这叫“要打狼，要打虎”，必先“要识狼，要识虎”。研究情况，掌握规律，就是研究我们所要做的工作对象是“狼”还是“虎”，“狼”是什么性，“虎”是什么性，然后作好思想准备、物质准备，准备好打“狼”打“虎”的武器，组织好打“狼”打“虎”的队伍，然后勇往直前，聚而歼之，取得胜利。具有真正大无畏的胆量的革命者，总是这样善于科学分析，善谋善断，这乃是他真正高明之处。正是因为有这种高明，他才具有不怕任何困难的真实的胆量。所谓“艺高胆大”，就是这个道理。
    在我们的实际工作中，也有一些同志从表面上看来，是很讲究谋略的。他们遇事先研究条件，数算困难，小心谨慎，只怕把事情做坏了。可是，他们缺少的正是革命的胆量。革命的胆量是革命的谋略的前提，只有首先有了革命的胆量，才能看得远、想得宽，智多谋高，有所作为。否则，缺乏革命的胆量，庸庸碌碌，谋来谋去，即使想出一些办法，既不高明，也不敢拿去实践，只能是“纸上谈兵”罢了。具有真正革命谋略的人，总是首先在战略上把困难当作是“纸老虎”，因而蔑视它，敢于去打它，而在“战役”、“战斗”中，又把困难看作是“真老虎”，从而踏实苦干地去打，这便是他的最为可贵的品质。正因为有这种可贵的品质，他才能具有真正的革命谋略。
