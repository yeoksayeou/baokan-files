Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 10th: According to local newspapers, the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnamese People's Army wrote a letter to the International Commission on August 1st, requesting that a working group, including liaison officers from both sides, be sent to the Ngo Dinh Diem group's "dense zones" for investigation. In the letter, the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnamese People's Army protested the atrocities of the South Vietnamese authorities in establishing "dense zones" to imprison and retaliate against former resistance personnel and patriotic people. The letter also demanded the release of imprisoned people, compensation for the families of the deceased, and the dissolution of all "dense zones."

The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary on August 9th, strongly condemning the Ngo Dinh Diem group's crimes in establishing "dense zones." The commentary pointed out that the Ngo Dinh Diem group's attempt to implement its "dense zone" plan proves that they are in a state of panic. The commentary pointed out that Ngo Dinh Diem's policy is making the situation in South Vietnam even more tense. Continuing to implement this policy is digging their own graves.

According to recent reports in local newspapers, the Ngo Dinh Diem group, disregarding the increasingly fierce opposition of the South Vietnamese people, continues to frantically promote the "dense zone" policy, further persecuting and suppressing patriotic people. In order to realize this malicious conspiracy, Ngo Dinh Diem personally went to Dinh Tuong and Long An provinces on July 30th and 31st respectively, to preside over the "completion ceremonies" of the My Phuoc Tay and Duc Hue "dense zones." In order to drive people into the "dense zones," the Ngo Dinh Diem group mobilized a large number of regular troops, public security forces, and armed secret agents to conduct continuous "sweeps," brutally killing people, plundering and raping women, and destroying fields and houses, plunging innocent peaceful residents into endless pain and misery.

    越南人民军代表团致函国际委员会
    抗议越南南方建立“稠密区”迫害爱国者
    “人民报”指出吴庭艳集团的暴行是自挖坟墓
    新华社河内10日电　据此间报纸报道，越南人民军联络代表团在8月1日写信给国际委员会，要求派出包括双方联络官员的工作组，到吴庭艳集团的“稠密区”进行调查。越南人民军联络代表团的信中，抗议越南南方当局建立“稠密区”用来监禁和报复前抗战人员和爱国人民的暴行。信中还要求释放被监禁的人民，抚恤死难者家属和解散所有的“稠密区”。
    越南“人民报”在8月9日发表评论，强烈谴责吴庭艳集团建立“稠密区”的罪行。评论指出，吴庭艳集团力图实现它的“稠密区”计划，证明他们正处于惊慌中。评论指出，吴庭艳这个政策，使越南南方局势更加紧张。继续执行这个政策，就是自挖坟墓。
    据此间报纸近日报道，吴庭艳集团不顾越南南方人民日益激烈的反对，继续疯狂地推行“稠密区”政策，进一步迫害和镇压爱国人民。为了实现这种恶毒阴谋，吴庭艳亲自出马，在7月30、31日两天分别到定祥隆安两省，主持美福西和德惠两个“稠密区”的“落成典礼”。吴庭艳集团为了驱赶人民进“稠密区”，调动了大批正规军、公安力量和武装特务，进行连续不断的“扫荡”，残酷地杀害人民，大肆抢劫、奸淫妇女，毁坏田园和房屋，使无辜的和平居民陷入无限痛苦和悲惨的境地。
