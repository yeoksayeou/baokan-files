    Tianjin Medical Personnel in the "Planned Prevention and Treatment" Campaign
    By our reporter Yu Xigui
    The "Planned Prevention and Treatment" campaign, carried out by medical workers in conjunction with the broad masses, is flourishing in Tianjin. They have gone deep into every factory and commune, even to every family, and in just one month, they have conducted health check-ups for more than three million people, treated many difficult and complicated diseases, and trained more than 3,000 Red Cross medical assistants and more than 400,000 Red Cross health workers.

            Imparting Medical and Health Knowledge
    One day, in the Xilou Store in Tianjin, a pregnant woman suddenly fainted. People anxiously rushed to call a doctor. At this moment, Gao Qingsheng, a sales clerk from the nearby Sandeli Retail Store, heard the news and rushed over. He skillfully opened the Red Cross medical kit, took out a stethoscope, examined and treated the pregnant woman, and soon, she was out of danger. People praised this "sales clerk doctor" endlessly.
    It turned out that the nineteen sales clerks and staff members of the Sandeli Retail Store, under the training of medical workers from the First Central Hospital and the Qiandezhuang Outpatient Clinic, had all reached the level of Red Cross medical assistants or Red Cross health workers. This is a remarkable achievement in the "Planned Prevention and Treatment" campaign.
    Sun Yucheng, the attending physician of the Qiandezhuang Outpatient Clinic, in order to help the sales clerks master medical and health knowledge, gave lectures to the sales clerks after work, rain or shine, without interruption. He believed that sales clerks have the most contact with the masses, and whether their sale of food is hygienic is directly related to the prevention and treatment of diseases and the safeguarding of people's health. Therefore, sales clerks should become a vital force in the mass "Planned Prevention and Treatment" campaign. Therefore, he actively helped the sales clerks become familiar with health knowledge. After they had a certain level of medical knowledge, he also helped them establish health rooms and medicine cabinets in the store, and also used his spare time to sell goods with the sales clerks to help them better master this new "business."
    After mastering health knowledge, the sales clerks played a greater role in organizing the people's economic life. The sales clerks of the Sandeli Store often took the opportunity of delivering goods to homes to publicize health knowledge to the residents. With the help of doctors from the outpatient clinic, they established health cards for the residents within the supply range. If there were patients, they would treat them if they could, and if they couldn't, they would ask a doctor on their behalf, becoming a powerful assistant to the medical staff in carrying out "Planned Prevention and Treatment."

          Relying on the Masses to Conquer Dermatitis
    Song Jianzhang, the attending surgeon of Hedong Hospital, said when talking about his experience in "Planned Prevention and Treatment": "Planned Prevention and Treatment" is essentially the Party teaching us medical workers to follow the mass line. In the duck slaughtering workshop of the Tianjin First Food Processing Factory, in the past, some workers' hands suffered from occupational dermatitis. Severe cases had bleeding at the base of the fingernails. Although the factory Party organization had designated the factory health station doctor to be responsible for treatment, it had not been cured. After the launch of the "Planned Prevention and Treatment," the attending surgeon Song Jianzhang and resident doctor Xu Nengzi came to this factory, and worked together with comrades such as the factory health station doctor Xue Baichuan, relying on the masses of workers, and cured this occupational disease in just over a month.
    The first time Song Jianzhang and Xu Nengzi went to the duck slaughtering workshop, they saw those hands suffering from dermatitis, and the expectant faces, which aroused infinite sympathy. But how should they be treated? This was a difficult problem for these two surgeons who had never been exposed to skin diseases. Lu Gang, the deputy secretary of the hospital's Party general branch, looked at their helpless faces and said kindly: We can't just treat the disease as a disease. We must rely on the masses to find out the cause of the dermatitis, and then we will find a way to cure it.
    Therefore, in addition to holding a forum for workers in the duck slaughtering workshop, Song Jianzhang and Xu Nengzi learned in detail about the process of workers suffering from dermatitis and the development of symptoms. They also participated in the labor of this workshop, and like the workers, immersed their hands in the tank filled with well water to pluck duck feathers. After four or five hours, red spots appeared on the back of their hands, which was an early symptom of dermatitis. Although it was itchy and uncomfortable, they were as happy as if they had found a treasure. Therefore, they conducted six tests on the water with duck feathers, and found that the bacteria in the water were the same as the bacteria in the dermatitis, thus initially confirming the source of the dermatitis.
    Then, they conducted in-depth interviews with the workers, and mastered a large amount of material on the causes of hand dermatitis and various treatment methods. After repeated research and experiments, they finally determined the prevention and treatment measures for dermatitis. More than a month later, the patients recovered their health.

            Go to the Masses
    In the "Planned Prevention and Treatment" campaign, Fan Quan, the famous pediatrician and director of Tianjin Children's Hospital, whenever he recalls his time in the district, conducting health surveys for the working people, he always says: "We doctors who have been sitting in the hospital waiting for patients for a long time, used to think that we had fulfilled our responsibilities as doctors by seeing patients who came to the door and not caring about what happened outside. Now I really feel that this way of thinking and working style is so far away from the requirements and hopes of the working people!"
    Fan Quan talked about meeting a construction worker when he went to the district. When this construction worker fell ill, the doctor told him to rest, but he secretly sneaked into the construction site... When he learned that Fan Quan was an experienced doctor, he said to Fan Quan: "Look, the construction task is so busy now, how can I rest? Please cure my illness quickly." After Fan Quan came back, the construction worker's words often lingered in his mind. He thought: "The working class is charging forward for socialist construction, disregarding everything of their own. Can I still stick to the rules and take small steps in my work? No!" He made a leap forward plan for himself, determined to go to the working people and do his best for their health.

### 在“计划防治”运动中的天津医务人员

    在“计划防治”运动中的天津医务人员
    本报记者　虞锡珪
    医务工作者与广大群众结合开展的“计划防治”运动，在天津市蓬勃开展。他们深入每一个工厂和公社直到每一个家庭，在短短的一个月中，就为三百多万人普查了健康状况，医治了不少疑难病症，还培养了三千多名红十字医士和四十多万名红十字卫生员。
            传授医疗卫生知识
    在天津西楼商店里，有一天，突然，一位孕妇晕倒了，人们焦急地忙着要去请医生。这时，附近的三德里零售商店售货员高庆升闻讯赶来，他熟练地打开红十字医包，取出听诊器，为孕妇作了检查和医治，不一会，这位孕妇就脱离了危险。人们对这位“售货员医生”赞扬不已。
    原来三德里零售商店的十九位售货员和工作人员，在第一中心医院和谦德庄门诊部医务工作者的培训下，都达到了红十字医士或红十字卫生员的水平，这是“计划防治”运动中的一个出色的成就。
    谦德庄门诊部主治医生孙毓成为了帮助售货员掌握医疗卫生知识，下了班就给售货员讲课，风雨无阻，从不间断。他认为售货员接触群众最多，他们出售食品是否卫生，与防治疾病，保障人民健康有直接关系，因此，售货员应该成为群众性“计划防治”运动中的一支生力军。于是，他积极帮助售货员熟悉卫生知识，当他们具备一定医疗知识水平以后，又帮助他们在商店里建立保健室和药柜，还利用业余时间和售货员一起售货，帮助他们更好地掌握这项新的“业务”。
    售货员们掌握了保健知识以后，在组织人民经济生活中发挥了更大的作用。三德里商店的售货员们，常常通过送货上门的机会，向居民宣传卫生常识，在门诊部医生帮助下，为供应范围内的居民建立了健康卡片，遇有病人，能治的就治，不能治的代请医生，成为医务人员开展“计划防治”的有力助手。
          依靠群众，战胜皮炎
    河东医院外科主治医生宋建章，谈到对“计划防治”的体会时说：“计划防治”实质上就是党教导我们医务人员必须走群众路线。天津第一食品加工厂宰鸭车间的工人中，过去部分工人的双手都患职业性皮炎，重患者指甲根部出血。虽然工厂党组织曾指定工厂保健站医生负责治疗，但一直未得到根治。开展“计划防治”以后，这位外科主治医生宋建章和住院医生徐能滋来到这个工厂，和工厂保健站医生薛百川等同志同心协力，依靠工人群众，一个多月就根治了这种职业病。
    宋建章和徐能滋第一次到宰鸭车间时，看到那些得皮炎的手，和一张张期待着的面孔，激起了无限同情。可是到底该怎么医治呢？对于这两位从未接触过皮肤病的外科医生来说，是一个难题。医院党总支副书记吕刚瞧着他俩一筹莫展的面孔，亲切地说：不能就病医病，一定要依靠群众，找出得皮炎的原因，然后才会找到根治的办法。
    于是，宋建章和徐能滋除在宰鸭车间召开了工人座谈会，详细了解工人患皮炎的经过及症状发展的情况，还参加了这个车间的劳动，和工人一样把手浸在盛满井水的槽子里拔鸭毛，四、五个小时以后，他们的手背起了红点，这正是皮炎的早期症状，虽然刺痒很难受，但是他们却高兴得如获至宝。于是，他们对有鸭子毛的水，先后进行六次化验，发现水里的细菌和皮炎的细菌一样，从而初步肯定了皮炎的病源。
    接着，他们又在工人中进行深入访问，掌握了大量手皮炎发生的原因和各种治疗办法的材料，又经过反复研究试验，终于确定了对皮炎的防治措施。一个多月以后，患者都恢复了健康。
            到群众中去
    在“计划防治”运动中，著名的小儿科专家、天津儿童医院院长范权，每当回忆起自己下地段，为劳动人民进行健康调查时，他总是说：“我们这些长期坐在医院里等病人的医生，过去认为上门就看，出门不管，就已经尽到了医生的责任。现在真感到，这种思想作风，距离劳动人民的要求和希望是多么远！”
    范权谈到他下地段时认识一位建筑工人，这位建筑工人生病时，医生让他休息，可是他却偷偷地溜进了工地……当他知道范权是位有经验的医生时，就对范权说：“您瞧，现在的建设任务是多么忙啊，我怎么能休息，快点把我的病治好吧。”范权回来以后，建筑工人的话，经常在他的脑子里回旋。他想：“工人阶级为社会主义建设冲锋陷阵，不顾自己的一切，我还能墨守成规地在工作中迈四方步子么？不能！”他为自己订了个跃进规划，决心到劳动人民中去，一定要为他们的健康竭尽全力。
