    Time is Power	Li Zhimin
    We cannot do any revolutionary work without time. Time is both infinite and finite. It is infinite in terms of the movement and development of all things, but finite in terms of completing a specific task. Different classes have different concepts of time. Spending time on creating human suffering, squandering social wealth, indulging in extravagance, and engaging in hedonistic pursuits is a reflection of the decadent and moribund mentality of the exploiting classes. Procrastination, looseness, complacency, and lack of ambition are reflections of the spiritual state of small producers who lack grand aspirations and great achievements. The proletariat has a completely different attitude toward time. It possesses a dialectical materialist worldview and communist ambitions. Therefore, it is always energetic, vigorous, decisive, and ready to act. It is most adept at cherishing and using time to complete the most arduous tasks and create the greatest achievements in the shortest possible time. Racing against time and striving to stay ahead of time is a characteristic of our revolutionary life and a manifestation of the proletarian revolutionary spirit.
    Time is a necessary condition for the victory of our revolutionary cause. Whether or not we can seize time often determines the success or failure of the revolutionary cause. In a certain sense, seizing time is victory, and losing time is failure. The central issue in seizing time is speed, and the essence of speed is initiative versus passivity. Taking combat as an example, when two armies encounter each other, whoever acts quickly, deploys forces first, and seizes key points first, gains the initiative and puts the opponent in a passive position, achieving the "advantage of opportunity." Conversely, the enemy will seize the initiative and put oneself in a passive position. Every victory achieved by the Chinese people in the twenty-two years of revolutionary war was inseparable from seizing time. The same is true in socialist construction: either build socialism at a high speed, or fall behind, be passive, and be vulnerable to attack. As Lenin said, "Either perish, or forge full steam ahead. That is how history poses the question."
    Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, skillfully utilized the element of time in leading the Chinese revolutionary struggle, demonstrating amazing energy and wisdom. He was able to use time most effectively and handle complex and heavy work with amazing efficiency. He was so adept at seizing time and opportunities, and at proposing and solving various key issues in the revolution with great accuracy and timeliness. Comrade Mao Zedong often asked us to grasp the laws of objective things well, and on this premise, to dare to think and dare to act, to complete various work tasks at high speed, and to promote the rapid development of the revolutionary cause. As early as the Second Revolutionary Civil War period, Comrade Mao Zedong said when talking about the protracted nature of the Chinese revolution: "It is not to say that Chinese affairs can only be done slowly. Chinese affairs must be done bravely. The danger of national subjugation does not allow us a minute of slackness. The speed of future revolutionary development must also be much faster than in the past, because the situation in China and the world is in a new era of war and revolution."① In the long Chinese revolutionary war, Comrade Mao Zedong demonstrated unparalleled brilliance in seizing time and winning time. For example, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the strategic policy of protracted war and the tactical policy of quick battles. The so-called protracted war on the strategic level meant that in a situation where the enemy was strong and we were weak, we could not achieve victory in the war in the short term. We must use the situation where time was in our favor and unfavorable to the enemy to conduct protracted warfare, seize time, recuperate our strength, and continuously develop and strengthen ourselves until the balance of power between the enemy and us underwent a fundamental change, and finally defeat the enemy. The so-called quick battles on the tactical level meant that in specific battles, we should choose favorable opportunities, concentrate superior forces, and eliminate the enemy in one fell swoop in the shortest possible time and at the fastest speed. Winning time and achieving victory in battles and tactics helped us win time strategically and accelerate the final victory of the entire war. After our country achieved the victory of the New Democratic Revolution and entered a new stage of socialist revolution, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, a large country with the largest population in the world basically realized the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in just seven years. While rapidly realizing socialist transformation, Comrade Mao Zedong further pointed out: "The scale and speed of China's industrialization, the scale and speed of the development of science, culture, education, health, and other undertakings, can no longer be done completely according to what was originally thought. These should be appropriately expanded and accelerated."② In 1958, on the basis of basically completing the socialist transformation on the economic front and achieving a great victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front through the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Its spiritual essence is to mobilize all positive factors and develop our country's socialist construction at high speed, and build our country into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and a modern science and culture in the shortest possible time. Therefore, the soul of the general line of socialist construction is high speed, which is to seize time. Comrade Mao Zedong put the competition with the economic development of the world's major capitalist countries on the agenda, and called on the people of the whole country to catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years (later shortened to ten years) or even shorter. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought and under the guidance of the general line, our country's socialist construction undertakings are advancing by leaps and bounds, changing our country's "poor and blank" face rapidly.
    The continuous great leap forward in our country's socialist construction marks the determination of the 650 million hardworking and brave Chinese people to be the masters of time. The Great Leap Forward has given people a new concept of time. Things that were thought to be impossible to accomplish in a few years have now been accomplished in a few months or even a few days. Work that was previously thought to be impossible to start is now being put on the agenda in batches. High targets that were previously considered difficult to achieve are now being broken through one after another. In 1959, the value created per minute in industrial and agricultural production increased more than four times compared with the founding of the People's Republic of China (1949), and compared with 1957, it doubled in two years. Seizing a minute of time can increase a large amount of wealth; and wasting a minute of time is a loss of a large amount of wealth. "Opportunity knocks but once"! How to use time most effectively has become the most concerning issue for the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward, and is a sign of whether all our work can continue to leap forward.
    So, how can we use time most effectively? The key is whether there is revolutionary vigor. Where there is revolutionary vigor, there will be a leap forward; the greater the revolutionary vigor, the more the work will catch up with time and complete various tasks ahead of schedule and with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Conversely, where there is no revolutionary vigor or insufficient vigor, it will inevitably fall behind time. Vigor produces time, vigor produces speed, and that is the reason. But having revolutionary vigor does not mean that we have everything. We must also pay attention to how to use this vigor well. To fully unleash the revolutionary vigor of the masses, we must follow the mass line and launch mass movements on a large scale. High speed is inseparable from the mass line. Facts have proved that only by fully mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and launching mass movements on a large scale can we achieve high speed and realize the Great Leap Forward. In the Great Leap Forward, we must pay attention to combining tension with relaxation and work with rest. This seems slow on the surface, but only in this way can we continue to leap forward. Whether or not we can do this depends on combining hard work with clever work, carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, and vigorously promoting mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation to greatly improve labor productivity. In this way, we can guarantee the more effective use of time and the saving of time. The surging and magnificent technological revolution movement in our country is accelerating the comprehensive technological transformation of our country's national economy, and the labor productivity of many production units has increased exponentially, saving a large amount of labor force and greatly shortening the time, which has powerfully promoted the continuous leap forward of industrial and agricultural production. To use time most effectively, we must also continuously improve our leadership style and continuously reform labor organization and production organization. The new situation of continuous leap forward in socialist construction powerfully promotes the revolution in our leadership style and labor organization and production organization; and continuously improving our leadership style and continuously reforming labor organization and production organization are important guarantees for fully mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, improving labor productivity, and using time most effectively. Whether or not we can do all this depends on people, and depends on people's political and ideological conditions. Therefore, in order to do all this well, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party and adhere to the principle of putting politics in command.
    In order to ensure the continuous leap forward of socialist construction, we must resolutely struggle against all phenomena that waste time. We must constantly criticize the right-leaning thoughts of being sluggish, lacking vigor, and being content with being in the middle or even at the bottom. This is a reflection of the decadent and declining worldview of the exploiting classes in the revolutionary ranks, and therefore cannot be eradicated in the short term. We must wage a long-term and repeated struggle against it. It should be pointed out that the waste of time is the greatest waste; the saving of time is the greatest saving. Because time is an invisible thing, people often do not pay as much attention to wasting time as they do to wasting materials and resources. This concept must be broken. We must strive to reduce the consumption of time required in all work and strive to complete more work and produce more and better products in a certain amount of time. Of course, this does not mean that it is enough to pay attention to saving time and that we can ignore saving materials and resources. We must know that reducing the consumption of materialized labor in production, reducing costs, and saving raw materials, materials, tools, etc., are also equivalent to saving the time consumed in creating these products in the past, because we can use the saved materials and funds to produce more products and make the construction cause develop faster. Any extravagance and waste that causes loss of material and financial resources is equal to the waste of time consumed in creating these materials and resources. Although a few people subjectively want to leap forward and do more work, they lack a realistic and down-to-earth style. On the surface, they seem to have done a lot of work, but in reality, they have not achieved anything. They have separated more, faster, better, and more economical results, and only seek more and faster, but not better and more economical results. In this way, not only can they not achieve the goal of saving time, but also because they consume too much materialized labor, reduce quality, and even cause rework, which causes even greater waste of time. Therefore, we must regard more, faster, better, and more economical results as a unity of opposites, with speed as the center, driving high quality and high output, and achieving the goal of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Not only demand more and faster, but also demand better and more economical results; not only demand quantity, but also demand quality. The saving of time is not only reflected in the increase in the quantity of products, but also in the improvement of the quality of products. Because the quality of products is improved, the period of use of the products is prolonged, which is also equivalent to shortening the time for manufacturing these products.
    The bureaucratic leadership style also often causes waste of time. A few comrades are not good at conducting investigation and research work, rarely go deep into the grassroots and deep into the masses, and are accustomed to sitting in the office and issuing orders, issuing documents and instructions randomly, filling out too many forms and reports, and holding too many meetings, causing waste of manpower, material resources, and time. They hold meetings without preparation, without a center, rambling on and on, delaying time, and failing to solve or rarely solving problems. Their speeches, reports, and articles are lengthy, empty, and devoid of substance, wasting their own time and wasting other people's time. We must pay attention to the certain degree of bureaucratism that still exists among a few cadres and resolutely overcome it.
    Time is advancing. Time, for revolutionaries, is a precious force. The advance of time marks the development of the revolutionary cause. Time, for dying and declining imperialism and all reactionaries, is a terrible threat. The disappearance of time marks the approaching of their doomsday. We say: The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day, which means that time is in our favor and not in the enemy's favor. The wheels of history are rolling forward at a high speed, and mankind will enter the infinitely beautiful communist utopia. Imperialism and all decadent forces will be completely eliminated from the earth. This is the inevitable law of the development of objective things and does not depend on people's subjective wishes. However, we cannot sleep and wait for this day to come. Imperialism and all reactionaries will not disappear on their own. They will still make a desperate struggle, try their best to seize time, and attempt to reverse the direction of historical progress. Therefore, we must make full use of time, wage a resolute struggle against the enemy, and work tirelessly to steer the era forward. The great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction that we are now engaged in is also a cause of competing with imperialism for time and speed. The time and speed of building socialism are related to the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism. As long as we win time, we can achieve victory. The future belongs to us, and we are the masters of time. We must follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and have both far-sighted ambitions and a down-to-earth spirit of hard work. In this way, we can maximize the control and use of time, let it shine and heat up in our hands, transform it into strength, promote the rapid growth of new things, accelerate the realization of the great ideal of communism, and accelerate the death of imperialism and all decadent forces.

### 时间就是力量

    时间就是力量	李志民
    我们从事任何革命工作，都离不开时间。时间是无限的又是有限的。对一切事物的运动发展来说，它是无限的；对我们完成一件具体任务来说，它又是有限的。不同的阶级有着不同的时间观念。把时间花费在制造人类的痛苦、挥霍社会财富、骄奢淫逸、吃喝玩乐上面，是剥削阶级没落的、垂死的心理状态的反映。拖拖拉拉，松松散散，满足现状，不求上进，是小生产者无大志向、无大作为的精神状态的反映。无产阶级对待时间的态度则截然不同，它有辩证唯物主义的世界观，有共产主义的雄心壮志。因此，它总是精神焕发，朝气勃勃，雷厉风行，说干就干，最善于珍惜和使用时间，用最短的时间，完成最艰巨的任务，创造最伟大的成绩。同时间赛跑，尽一切努力赶在时间的前头，是我们革命生活的特征，是无产阶级革命精神的表现。
    时间是我们革命事业取得胜利的必要条件。能否争取时间，往往决定革命事业的成功或失败。在一定意义上说，争取了时间就是胜利，丧失了时间就是失败。能否争取时间的中心问题是快和慢，而快和慢的实质就是主动和被动。以作战为例，两军遭遇，谁动作快，先展开兵力，先抢占要点，谁就争取了主动而制对方于被动，取得“先机之利”；反之，主动权就会被敌人夺去，而陷自己于被动地位。中国人民在二十二年的革命战争中所取得的任何一次战斗的胜利，都是与争取了时间分不开的。在社会主义建设上也是如此：或者是高速度建成社会主义，或者是落后、被动、挨打，二者必居其一。正如列宁所说：“或者是灭亡，或者是开足马力向前猛进，历史就是这样提出问题的。”
    中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志在领导中国革命斗争中，巧妙地运用了时间的因素，表现了惊人的精力和智慧。他能够最有效地使用时间，以惊人的效率处理着复杂而繁重的工作。他是那样地善于抓取时间，捕捉时机，十分准确又极为及时地提出和解决革命中的各种关键问题。毛泽东同志经常要求我们很好地掌握客观事物的规律性，在这个前提下，敢想敢干，高速度地完成各项工作任务，推进革命事业的迅速发展。远在第二次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志在谈到中国革命的长期性的时候就说过：“不是说中国的事情只能慢吞吞地去干，中国的事情要勇猛地去干，亡国的危险不容许我们有一分钟的懈怠。今后革命发展的速度，也一定比过去要快得多，因为中国的和世界的局面都是临在战争和革命的新时期了。”①在长期的中国革命战争中，毛泽东同志在争取时间和赢得时间上表现了无比的英明。例如在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志提出了战略上的持久战和战役战术上的速决战的方针。所谓战略上的持久战，就是在敌强我弱的情况下，我们不可能在短期内取得战争的胜利，就必须利用时间有利于我而不利于敌的形势，进行持久作战，争取时间，生息力量，不断发展壮大自己，直到敌我力量对比发生根本变化，而最后战胜敌人。所谓战役战术上的速决战，就是在具体的战役战斗上，选择有利时机，集中优势兵力，用最短的时间，以最快的速度，一举消灭敌人。而战役战术上不断赢得时间，取得胜利，又帮助了我们在战略上赢得时间，加速取得整个战争的最后胜利。当我国取得新民主主义革命胜利，转入社会主义革命新阶段以后，在毛泽东思想的指导下，一个世界上人口最多的大国在短短的七年里，就基本上实现了农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。在迅速实现社会主义改造的同时，毛泽东同志更进一步指出：“中国的工业化的规模和速度，科学、文化、教育、卫生等项事业的发展的规模和速度，已经不能完全按照原来所想的那个样子去做了，这些都应当适当地扩大和加快。”②1958年，在基本完成经济战线上的社会主义改造和经过全民整风运动与反右派斗争取得政治思想战线的社会主义革命伟大胜利的基础上，毛泽东同志又提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，它的精神实质就是调动一切积极因素，高速度地发展我国社会主义建设事业，在最短的时间内把我国建设成为一个具有现代化工业、现代化农业、现代化科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国。因此，社会主义建设总路线的灵魂，就是高速度，就是争时间。毛泽东同志把同世界上主要资本主义国家的经济发展的竞赛提到日程上来，向全国人民提出了在十五年（后又缩短为十年）或者更短的时间内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国的号召。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在总路线的指引下，我国社会主义建设事业如万马奔腾，一日千里地连续跃进，我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划早已提前三年完成，我国“一穷二白”的面貌正在迅速改变。
    我国社会主义建设的连续大跃进，标志着六亿五千万勤劳勇敢的中国人民决心做时间的主人。大跃进使人们对时间产生了新的概念。过去认为几年办不到的事，现在几个月甚至若干天就办到了。过去认为目前还无法着手进行的工作，现在已经一批一批地提上日程。过去认为难以达到的高指标，现在一个又一个地被突破。1959年在工农业生产上每分钟所创造的价值，比中华人民共和国成立时（1949年）增加了四倍多，而与1957年比较，两年内即增加了一倍。争取一分钟的时间，就可以增加大量的财富；而浪费一分钟的时间，就是大量财富的损失。“机不可失，时不再来”！如何最有效地使用时间，成了大跃进中的中国人民最关心的问题，是我们一切工作能否持续跃进的标志。
    那么，怎样才能最有效地使用时间呢？关键是有无革命干劲，哪里有革命干劲，哪里就能跃进；哪里的革命干劲越大，哪里的工作就越能赶在时间的前头，多快好省地提前和超额完成各种任务。反之，哪里没有革命干劲或干劲不足，哪里就必然要落到时间的后面。干劲出时间，干劲出速度，道理就在于此。但是有了革命干劲，还不能说就有了一切，还必须注意如何很好地使用这种干劲。要想充分发挥群众的革命干劲，必须走群众路线和大搞群众运动，高速度是同群众路线分不开的。事实证明，只有充分地发动群众，依靠群众，大搞群众运动，才能实现高速度，实现大跃进。在大跃进中必须注意有张有弛、劳逸结合，这从表面上看似乎是慢，实际上只有这样才能持续跃进。而能否作到这一点，关键又在于要把苦干和巧干结合起来，要进行技术革新和技术革命，大搞机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化，大大提高劳动生产率。这样，就可以保证更有效地利用时间和节约时间。目前在我国风起云涌、波澜壮阔的技术革命运动，正在使我国国民经济加速实现全面的技术改造，许多生产单位的劳动生产率成倍地提高，劳动力大量地节省，时间大大地缩短，有力地促进了工农业生产的持续跃进。要想最有效地使用时间，还必须不断地改进领导作风，不断地改革劳动组织与生产组织。社会主义建设不断跃进出现的新形势，有力地促进着我们的领导作风和劳动组织与生产组织方面的革命；而不断地改进领导作风，不断地改革劳动组织和生产组织，又是充分地调动广大群众的革命积极性、提高劳动生产率、最有效地利用时间的重要保证。能否作到这一切都决定于人，决定于人的政治思想状况。因此，为了做好这一切，就必须加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。
    为了保证社会主义建设的持续跃进，必须同一切浪费时间的现象进行坚决的斗争。要不断地批判疲疲沓沓、干劲不足、甘居中游甚至甘居下游的右倾思想。这是腐朽没落的剥削阶级的世界观在革命队伍中的反映，因而不是短期内可以肃清的，必须同它进行长期的反复的斗争。应该指出，对时间的浪费，是最大的浪费；对时间的节约，是最大的节约。由于时间是无形的东西，人们对于浪费时间往往不像对待浪费物资资财那样重视，这种观念必须打破。要在一切工作中尽力减少所需时间的消耗，争取在一定的时间内，完成更多的工作量，制造更多更好的产品。当然，这并不是说：只要注意节约时间就够了，可以不注意节约物资资财。要知道，在生产中缩减物化劳动的消耗，减低了成本，节省了原料、材料、工具等等，也等于节约了过去在创造这些产品时所消耗的时间，因为可以利用节约的材料和资金，生产更多的产品，使建设事业发展得更快。任何铺张浪费所造成的物力和财力的损失，都是等于对创造这些物资资财所消耗的时间的浪费。有少数人虽然主观上也想跃进，想多做工作，但是，他们缺乏实事求是、踏踏实实的作风，表面看来似乎做了不少工作，实际上并没有落到实处。他们把多快好省割裂了，只求多快，不求好省。这样，不仅不能达到节省时间的目的，而且由于过多地消耗了物化劳动，降低了质量，甚至造成返工，反而造成时间的更大浪费。因此，必须把多快好省看成是矛盾的统一体，以快为中心，带动优质、高产，达到多快好省的目的。不仅要求多快，而且要求好省；不仅要求数量，而且要求质量。对时间的节省不仅表现在产品数量的提高上，而且表现在产品质量的提高上。因为产品的质量提高了，就延长了产品使用的期限，也就等于缩短了制造这些产品的时间。
    官僚主义的领导作风，也常常造成对时间的浪费。有少数同志不善于进行调查研究工作，很少深入基层和深入群众，而习惯于坐在办公室里发号施令，乱发文件指示，填过多的表报，开过多的会议，造成人力物力和时间的浪费。他们开会无准备、无中心，东拉西扯，拖延时间，不能解决或很少解决问题。他们发言、作报告、写文章，冗长空洞，言之无物，既浪费了自己的时间，又浪费了别人的时间。对于少数干部仍然存在着的某种程度的官僚主义习气，必须引起我们的注意，坚决加以克服。
    时间在前进着。时间，对革命者来说，是宝贵的力量，时间的前进，标志着革命事业的发展；时间，对垂死没落的帝国主义和一切反动派来说，则是可怕的威胁，时间的消失，标志着他们末日的临近。我们说：敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来，也就是说，时间有利于我们，而不利于敌人。历史的车轮向前飞速滚动，人类将进入无限美好的共产主义大同世界，帝国主义和一切腐朽势力将要从地球上彻底消灭。这是客观事物发展的必然规律，是不以人们的主观愿望为转移的。但是，我们不能睡大觉等待这一天的到来。帝国主义和一切反动派是不会自行消灭的，他们还会作垂死挣扎，竭力争夺时间，妄图扭转历史前进的方向。因此，我们必须充分地利用时间，同敌人进行坚决的斗争，不懈地进行艰苦的工作，驾驭时代前进。我们现在所进行的伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，也是同帝国主义争时间、比速度的事业，建设社会主义的时间和速度是关系到社会主义同资本主义谁战胜谁的问题。我们只要赢得时间，就能取得胜利。未来是属于我们的，我们是时间的主人。我们要遵循毛泽东同志的指示，既要有高瞻远瞩的雄心壮志，又要有踏踏实实的苦干精神。这样，我们就能最大限度地支配时间，使用时间，让它在我们手中发光发热，化为力量，促使新生事物迅速成长，加速实现共产主义的伟大理想，加速帝国主义和一切腐朽势力的死亡。
