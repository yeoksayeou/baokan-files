Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang
Increase Fertilizer and Water to Promote Vigorous Growth of Hemp Plants

    (Reported by our newspaper) Farmers in the hemp-producing areas of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces are strengthening field management during the peak growing season of jute and ramie.

    Currently, over half of the second crop of ramie in Sichuan Province has been top-dressed and weeded. In Dazhu County, a nationally renowned ramie production area, over 80% of the second crop ramie has been top-dressed and weeded, and the ramie seedlings are lush and growing well. To ensure increased ramie production season after season, Sichuan has strengthened leadership in the field management of the second crop of ramie immediately after the harvest of the first crop. Many cadres in the Daxian Special District, a ramie-producing area, are taking the lead in planting ramie demonstration plots and experimental plots, setting an example and guiding the field management of the second crop of ramie. At present, the approximately 100,000 mu of ramie in this special district have mostly been cultivated and top-dressed, with seedlings over one chi (approximately 1/3 meter) tall. Many areas, while ensuring grain production, have also formed specialized teams with labor drawn from production teams, with fixed cadres responsible for managing the second crop of ramie.

    Hubei's hemp production areas, according to the production policy of "taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development," are going all out to strengthen the cultivation and management of the second crop of ramie, striving for the second crop to surpass the first crop and achieve balanced annual increases in ramie production. In the old hemp production areas of Yangxin, Xianning, and Wuchang counties, based on the characteristics of the second crop of ramie – rapid growth, short growing season, and susceptibility to drought during the growing period – they are seizing the time to harvest the first crop while also cutting stalks, weeding, and top-dressing in the 100,000 mu of hemp fields, with weeding and top-dressing covering about 40% of the area. Enshi County promoted more than 7,000 units of the 60-1 type hemp stripping machine during the rush to harvest the first crop of ramie and adopted simultaneous stripping, beating, and cultivation measures to effectively strengthen the cultivation and management of the second crop of ramie. Many hemp production areas, by seizing the season, have won sufficient growing time for the second crop of ramie, and thanks to two or three rainfalls, hemp crops are growing vigorously, with plant heights generally around four chi (approximately 1.3 meters).

    In Hunan Province, over 200,000 mu of jute has generally been cultivated and weeded once or twice, and fertilized once. The jute seedlings are green, leafy, and robust, generally four or five chi (approximately 1.3-1.7 meters) tall, and the tallest are eight or nine chi (approximately 2.7-3 meters) tall. Since mid-July, the main jute-producing areas have successively started the tense battle of rushing to harvest early rice and rushing to transplant late rice. Due to the large production tasks and short time this year, and the high demand for labor, all areas, under the guidance of the policy of "taking grain as the key link and making a great leap forward in all areas," are rationally arranging labor, both doing a good job in the "double rush" and doing a good job in the cultivation and management of jute. Generally, before the "double rush," they carry out one or two intensive cultivations and top-dressings of jute, and during the "double rush," they also fix a certain amount of labor to form specialized teams responsible for cultivating and managing hemp fields.

    Since mid-June, some areas of Jiangxi have faced varying degrees of drought threat to jute growth. The Provincial Party Committee instructed all areas to comprehensively arrange labor according to the progress of the "double rush," and to vigorously grasp the late-stage management of economic crops, to be meticulous and practical, and strive for high yields and multiple harvests. At present, a late-stage management campaign for hemp fields, centered on strengthening drought resistance, pest control, cultivation, fertilization, and eliminating third-class seedlings, is being carried out in depth throughout the province. Leping County organized 114 specialized teams for drought resistance, pest control, cultivation, and top-dressing, and timely strengthened late-stage management. The 7,800 mu of hemp fields throughout the county were generally sprayed with 666 solvent, and drought-stricken fields were also completely relieved of the threat. Jishui County, a key jute county, organized more than 3,000 people to rush to fertilize, in response to the lean growth of some jute due to insufficient fertilizer. Within a few days, more than 30,000 mu of jute was generally top-dressed with ten jin (5 kg) of chemical fertilizer per mu and covered with a layer of cattle manure.

    The people's communes in the hemp-producing areas of Zhejiang Province are seizing the current opportunity for jute to grow vigorously and rapidly, widely carrying out top-dressing, irrigation, pest control, weeding, and other work, strengthening mid-term cultivation and management, so that jute can be well-fed and watered, promote long stalks and long fibers, and strive for large-scale balanced and abundant production. In the four main hemp areas of Xiaoshan, Haining, Shangyu three counties and Qiantang United Commune, which account for more than 80% of the province's jute planting area, most of the jute has been fertilized twice for stalk growth; commune members have launched a drought resistance struggle, and over 83% of the hemp fields have been irrigated in a timely manner; many hemp fields have been treated for pests twice. Due to more fertilization, timely irrigation, and early pest control, first- and second-class seedlings account for about 80% in these four main hemp areas, and these jute plants, which are growing with thick stalks and strong leaves, are mostly over six chi (approximately 2 meters) tall.

    加肥加水　让麻株猛发快长
    本报讯　四川、湖北、湖南、江西、浙江五省麻区农民，趁黄麻、苎麻生长旺期加强田间管理。
    目前，四川全省已有一半以上的二麻进行了追肥、除草。全国著名苎麻产区的大竹县二麻追肥除草已达80％以上，麻苗一片葱绿，生长良好。为了保证苎麻季季增产，四川各地在头麻收获以后，都立即加强了二麻田间管理工作的领导。出产苎麻的达县专区许多干部都带头种植了苎麻指挥田、试验田，并从中作出榜样，指导二麻田间管理。目前，这个专区的十万亩左右的苎麻，大部分已进行中耕追肥，苗高一尺以上。许多地区在保证粮食生产的同时，还以生产队为单位抽出部分劳力组成专业队，固定干部负责管好二麻。
    湖北麻产区根据“以粮为纲，全面发展”的生产方针，正鼓足干劲，加强对二麻的培育管理，力争二麻超头麻，实现全年苎麻平衡增产。老麻产区阳新、咸宁、武昌等县，根据二麻生长速度快、生长季节短和生长期中易遇伏旱等特点，在抢收头麻的同时，就抓早、抓快、抓好，在十万亩麻园中边收边砍秆，边锄草，边追肥，进行锄草追肥的面积达40％左右。恩施县在抢收头麻中，推广了60—1型打麻器七千多部，并采取边剥麻、边打麻、边培育，切实加强了对二麻的培育管理。许多麻产区由于抢住了季节，为二麻赢得了充分生长时间，又由于得到了两三次雨水，因此，目前麻类作物生长茂盛，株高一般在四尺左右。
    湖南全省二十多万亩黄麻，已普遍中耕除草一两次，追施了一次肥料，麻苗叶绿粗壮，一般已有四、五尺高，最高的已有八、九尺高了。7月中旬以来，黄麻主要产区都先后开始了紧张的抢收早稻、抢插晚稻的战斗，由于今年生产任务大、时间短，需要的劳动力多，各地在“以粮为纲，全面跃进”的方针指导下，合理安排劳力，既搞好“双抢”，又搞好黄麻的培育管理。一般在“双抢”以前，对黄麻进行一两次突击中耕、追肥，在“双抢”期间，也固定了一定的劳力组成专业队负责培育管理麻田。
    江西6月中旬以来，部分地区黄麻生长遭到了不同程度的干旱威胁，省委指示各地根据“双抢”进展情况，全面安排劳力，狠抓一下经济作物的后期管理，做到抓细、抓实，力争高产多收。目前，一个以加强抗旱、防虫、中耕、施肥，消灭三类苗为中心的麻田后期管理运动，正在全省深入开展。乐平县组织了一百十四个抗旱、防虫、中耕、追肥等专业队，及时加强了后期管理，全县七千八百多亩麻田，普遍喷射了六六六溶剂，受旱田也全部解除了威胁。黄麻重点县吉水县，根据部分黄麻少肥生长瘦弱的情况，组织三千多人突击施肥，几天内，三万多亩黄麻便普遍每亩加施了十斤化肥，并加盖了一层牛栏粪。
    浙江省麻区各人民公社，抓紧当前黄麻猛发快长时机，广泛展开追肥、灌溉、治虫、除草等工作，加强中期培育管理，让黄麻吃饱喝足，促使长秆、长皮，争取大面积平衡丰产。占全省黄麻种植面积80％以上的萧山、海宁、上虞三个县和钱塘联社四个主要麻区的黄麻，大部分已施长秆肥两次；社员们展开抗旱斗争，83％以上的麻田及时得到灌溉；很多麻田已防虫两次。由于施肥较多，灌溉及时，治虫又早，这四个主要麻区一、二类苗占80％左右，这些长得秆粗叶壮的黄麻大多高达六尺以上。
