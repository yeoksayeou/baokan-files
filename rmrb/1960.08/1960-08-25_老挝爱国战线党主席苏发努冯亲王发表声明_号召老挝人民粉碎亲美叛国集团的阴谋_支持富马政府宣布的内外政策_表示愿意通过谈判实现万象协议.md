Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 23rd: The Lao Fighting Forces Radio tonight broadcast a statement by Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front. The full text is as follows: Dear compatriots:

　　The Lao Fighting Forces, in their struggle to liberate our beloved motherland from imperialist rule, have consistently adhered to a position in the interests of the motherland and the people. They have been engaged in unremitting struggle during the Anti-Japanese War and after the signing of the Geneva Accords to strive for the independence and unity of the motherland and the freedom and happiness of the people. The Vientiane Agreement was signed at the end of 1957 between the Lao Royal Government, headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma, and the Lao Fighting Forces, represented by myself. This was a great victory for our nation. It halted the fratricidal strife that had dragged on for several years, promoted the realization of national harmony, enabled the people to enjoy democratic and free rights, and guided our country onto the road of peaceful neutrality.

　　These victories were achieved because our nation possesses a profound spirit of patriotism and a spirit of heroic struggle, and also because of the efforts made by both the Lao Fighting Forces and the Royal Government, including the important contributions made by Prince Souvanna Phouma.

　　After the signing of the Vientiane Agreement, the Lao Fighting Forces have always strictly fulfilled these agreements with a spirit of utter loyalty to the motherland.

　　However, U.S. imperialism deliberately wants to turn Laos into its new type of colony and war base.

　　After the Lao Fighting Forces were merged into the national collective, the pro-American heads of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, vigorously undermined the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreement from 1958 onwards, systematically carrying out their traitorous and harmful activities. After excluding the International Commission from Laos in order to facilitate the realization of their ulterior motives, they carried out large-scale "sweeps" and persecutions, causing the people of our country to suffer unspeakably and the land to present a scene of desolation.

　　Not long ago, after arbitrarily dissolving the National Assembly, they held a deceptive election under the pressure of guns, established a National Assembly and the Sananikone-Phoumi Nosavan reactionary government that conformed to their intentions, in order to continue implementing a policy of subservience and expand and prolong the civil war, so as to thoroughly realize the plans of U.S. imperialism.

　　Faced with the increasingly blatant interference and manipulation conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, and faced with the critical moment of the life and death of the motherland, the entire people of our country have risen up to fight to defend the independence and unity of the motherland. In this struggle, a coup d'état recently broke out, led by Captain Kong Le, involving soldiers and people in Vientiane, overthrowing the reactionary Sananikone-Phoumi Nosavan government, which was a henchman of U.S. imperialism, and establishing a new government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister. According to the statement issued by Prince Phouma, the new government will implement a genuine policy of peaceful neutrality, stop the civil war, and achieve national harmony by contacting and negotiating with the Lao Fighting Forces and respecting the agreements that have been signed. This is a very important event, which shows that the deep desires of the entire Lao people for peace, neutrality, independence, democracy, and national harmony have reached a point where they must be fully realized. Souvanna Phouma's re-assumption of power to continue the line of peaceful neutrality and national harmony is a major victory for the Lao people's anti-U.S. and national salvation movement, and at the same time, it is a disastrous defeat for U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

　　On behalf of the Lao Patriotic Front, which has always taken peace, neutrality, national harmony, and the unification of the motherland, in line with the national interests and the wishes of the entire people, as its sole line, I hereby declare as follows:

　　1. The Lao Patriotic Front fully supports the domestic and foreign policies announced by the Souvanna Phouma government in its statement, namely, to achieve national harmony, stop the civil war, and implement a genuine policy of peaceful neutrality through bilateral negotiations and respect for the agreements that have been signed, to establish relations with all countries and to accept assistance from these countries without any political or military conditions attached.

　　2. The Lao Patriotic Front fully agrees with Prince Souvanna Phouma's view in his statement that it is necessary to contact and negotiate with the Lao Fighting Forces. The Lao Patriotic Front is ready at any time to contact and negotiate with the Lao Royal Government to jointly discuss and decide on ways to correctly and fully implement the Vientiane Agreement signed at the end of 1957. If necessary, supplementary measures can be taken to suit the new situation, so as to implement national harmony in Laos, thereby concentrating all efforts to build Laos into a progressive and prosperous country.

　　Faced with the major victory achieved by the anti-U.S. and national salvation struggle movement of our people, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are frantically and painstakingly carrying out restoration activities. At present, U.S. imperialism is instigating and assisting the Phoumi Nosavan clique to undermine the achievements of the coup and attempt to overthrow the government headed by Prince Phouma as Prime Minister. They are deceiving and coercing the army, which is still temporarily under their control, to march on Vientiane, cutting off the food supply lines to Vientiane, besieging the King and obstructing the King's approval of the Phouma government, sending henchmen to infiltrate the government to carry out sabotage activities, creating various difficulties for the government, and alienating the relationship between the government and the coup committee. All this is aimed at overthrowing the Souvanna Phouma government in order to restore their brutal dictatorial system. Faced with the current tense situation, in order to defend and develop the victory of the coup and support the Souvanna Phouma government, I, on behalf of the Lao Patriotic Front, put forward the following suggestions:

　　(1) The government must take effective measures to resolutely and uncompromisingly crush all rebellious actions of the rebellious elements who are acting as loyal lackeys of U.S. imperialism and are deliberately creating bloodshed among the Lao people and refusing to obey the orders of the government.

　　(2) Call on people from all walks of life to support the Royal Government in all aspects, vigorously develop production, and practice strict economy, so as to achieve a certain degree of self-sufficiency in life.

　　(3) Appeal to all countries that have always resolutely supported and helped the national liberation movement to provide material assistance, and immediately establish diplomatic relations with these countries.

　　Dear compatriots: Our nation has a tradition of unity and heroic struggle. All compatriots from rural areas to cities, including peasants, workers, youth, students, intellectuals, civil servants, officers and soldiers, police, public security personnel, various patriotic and progressive parties, monks, and members of the royal family, now need to unite more than ever before, actively and resolutely support the policies and guidelines of the government headed by Prince Phouma, in order to smash all new conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan clique, and work together to fight for the motherland to embark on the road of peace, neutrality, independence, democracy, unity, and prosperity.

　　The Lao Patriotic Front earnestly calls on the officers and soldiers of all military units who have been misled by the Phoumi Nosavan rebellion group to rise up against the pro-American traitorous clique and return to the embrace of the government led by Prince Phouma, in order to achieve national harmony and a genuine policy of peaceful neutrality.

　　The Lao Patriotic Front hopes that the government led by Prince Phouma will resolutely implement the various policies it has announced, and resolutely not allow U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to undermine the achievements of the coup and the government's policies and guidelines.

　　The Lao Patriotic Front calls on the governments and peoples of all peace-loving countries in the world, especially those countries that are responsible for fulfilling the 1954 Geneva Agreement on Laos, to support the just struggle of the Lao people.

    老挝爱国战线党主席苏发努冯亲王发表声明
    号召老挝人民粉碎亲美叛国集团的阴谋
    支持富马政府宣布的内外政策　表示愿意通过谈判实现万象协议
    新华社河内23日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今晚广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王发表声明，全文如下：亲爱的同胞们：
    寮国战斗部队在为把我们亲爱的祖国从帝国主义统治下解放出来的斗争中，一贯坚持为祖国和人民的利益的立场，他们在抗战时期和日内瓦协议签订以后，一直进行着不懈的斗争，以争取祖国的独立、统一和人民的自由幸福。以梭发那·富马亲王为首的老挝王国政府和以我为代表的寮国战斗部队在1957年底签订了万象协议。这是我们民族的巨大胜利。它制止了拖延了几年的兄弟自相残杀，促使民族和睦的实现，使得人民享受到民主自由权利，并引导我国走上和平中立的道路。
    这些胜利之所以取得，是因为我们民族具有深厚的爱国精神和英勇的斗争精神，同时也由于寮国战斗部队和王国政府双方作出了努力，其中包括有梭发那·富马亲王所作出的重要贡献。
    万象协议签订以后，寮国战斗部队始终以对祖国忠心耿耿的精神，严正地履行了这些协议。
    但是，美帝国主义蓄意要把老挝变成它的新型殖民地和战争基地。
    寮国战斗部队合并到国家集体之后，所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的亲美头目，在美帝国主义的指令下，从1958年起大力破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议，有计划地实现他们卖国殃民的勾当。他们为了便于实现其不可告人的阴谋而把国际委员会排斥出老挝之后，进行了大规模的“扫荡”和迫害，使得我国人民苦不堪言，国土呈现一片凄惨景象。
    不久以前，他们专横地解散了国会之后，在枪口的压力下举行了欺骗的选举，成立了符合他们意图的国会和松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万反动政府，以继续实行奴才政策，扩大和延长内战，以彻底实现美帝国主义的计划。
    面临美帝国主义越来越明目张胆的干涉和操纵的阴谋，面临祖国的生死关头，我国全体人民已经起来为保卫祖国的独立和统一而斗争。在这个斗争中，最近爆发了以贡勒大尉为首的万象士兵和人民举行的政变，推翻了美帝国主义的得力走狗松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万反动政府，成立了由梭发那·富马亲王担任首相的新政府。据富马亲王发表的声明，新政府将通过同寮国战斗部队进行接触和谈判以及尊重曾经签订的协议等办法来实行真正的和平中立政策，制止内战，实现民族和睦。这是非常重要的事件，它说明了老挝全体人民的和平中立、独立民主和民族和睦等深切的愿望已经到了必需得到充分实现的时候了。梭发那·富马亲王再次执政以继续实现和平中立路线和民族和睦，是老挝人民反美救国运动的重大胜利，同时也是美帝国主义及其走狗的惨重失败。
    我谨代表一贯以和平中立、民族和睦、统一祖国这种符合民族利益和全体人民愿望为自己唯一的路线的老挝爱国战线党发表声明如下：
    一、老挝爱国战线党完全拥护梭发那·富马政府在其声明中所宣布的对内和对外政策，即通过双方谈判、尊重曾经签订的协议来实行民族和睦，停止内战，并实行真正的和平中立路线，同所有国家建立关系并接受这些国家不附带任何政治和军事条件的援助。
    二、老挝爱国战线党完全赞成梭发那·富马亲王在声明中认为必须同寮国战斗部队进行接触和谈判的见解。老挝爱国战线党随时准备同老挝王国政府进行接触和谈判，以共同讨论和决定正确地、充分地实现1957年底签订的万象协议的办法。如果有必要的话，可以作出符合新情况的补充措施，以便实行老挝的民族和睦，从而集中一切力量把老挝建设成为一个进步和繁荣的国家。
    面对我国人民反美救国斗争运动取得的重大胜利，美帝国主义及其走狗正在疯狂地、千方百计地进行复辟活动。目前，美帝国主义正在大肆唆使和帮助富米·诺萨万集团破坏政变的成果和企图推翻以富马亲王为首相的政府。它们在欺骗、强迫仍然由他们暂时控制的军队向万象进军，切断万象市的粮食供应线，包围国王并阻挠国王批准富马政府，派遣爪牙混进政府进行破坏活动，给政府带来种种困难，离间政府和政变委员会的关系。这一切都是为了推翻梭发那·富马政府，以恢复他们的残暴的独裁制度。面对当前紧张局势，为了保卫和发展政变的胜利并支持梭发那·富马政府，我代表老挝爱国战线党提出如下建议：
    （一）对于充当美帝国主义忠实走狗的叛逆分子正在蓄意制造老挝人之间的流血而不肯遵从政府的命令的行为，政府必须采取有效措施，以便坚决地、毫不让步地粉碎他们的一切叛乱行动。
    （二）号召各阶层人民从各方面支持王国政府，大力发展生产，厉行节约，以便在一定程度上实行生活自给自足。
    （三）呼吁所有向来一贯坚决支持和帮助民族解放运动的国家给予物质援助，并立即同这些国家建立外交关系。
    亲爱的同胞们：我们民族具有团结和英勇斗争的传统。从农村到城市的全体同胞们，包括农民、工人、青年、学生、知识分子、公务人员、军官和士兵、警察、公安、各个爱国进步党派、各位僧侣和王族人士，目前已比任何时候更加需要团结一致，积极和坚决拥护以富马亲王为首的政府的政策路线，以粉碎美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万集团的一切新阴谋，并同心协力为祖国走上和平中立、独立民主、统一和繁荣的道路而斗争。
    老挝爱国战线党恳切地号召误跟富米·诺萨万叛乱集团走入迷途的各部队单位的官兵兄弟们起来反对亲美叛国集团，并回到由富马亲王领导的政府的怀抱里，以实现民族和睦和真正的和平中立政策。
    老挝爱国战线党希望由富马亲王领导的政府坚决实现它已经宣布的各项政策，坚决不允许美帝国主义及其走狗破坏政变的成果和政府的政策路线。
    老挝爱国战线党呼吁世界上所有爱好和平的国家的政府和人民，首先是对履行1954年关于老挝的日内瓦协议负有责任的国家支持老挝人民的正义斗争。
