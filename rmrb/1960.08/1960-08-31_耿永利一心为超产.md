    Geng Yongli is Single-Mindedly Dedicated to Exceeding Production Targets
    Thunder rumbled, and the rain poured down, but Geng Yongli drove his cart to the fields to deliver manure. The team leader told him to stop and go home to take shelter from the rain, but he said that transporting fertilizer to the fields was essential for boosting crop growth!
    Communist Party member Geng Yongli is a model member of the Gaogezhuang Production Team in the Qiaozi Commune, Huairou County. Although over fifty years old, he is full of energy. Recently, the team launched an autumn overproduction campaign, and they needed to give the late corn a supplemental application of liquid manure. Geng Yongli never picks and chooses when it comes to work, so he automatically volunteered to the team leader, saying, "I'll drive the cart to haul manure." Geng Yongli always acts on his words. He led the old ox, hitched it to the iron-wheeled cart, and went to each household's toilet to collect manure. Traveling back and forth two to three *li* from the village to the fields, he delivered six or seven loads every day. In order not to delay others' work, he always got up earlier than others to transport the liquid manure to the manure pool at the edge of the field in advance. Sometimes when it rained, he continued to work as usual. The team leader and commune members advised him to take shelter from the rain, but he said, "Applying fertilizer is to feed the crops, and the rain allows them to drink their fill of water. To harvest more grain in the autumn, a little rain on me doesn't matter." Under Geng Yongli's influence, many commune members have stepped up their efforts to apply supplemental fertilizer to the crops. In just over six days, all 110 *mu* of late corn in the team were given a supplemental application of liquid manure.

    耿永利一心为超产
    雷声隆隆响，大雨哗哗地下着，耿永利赶着车往地里送粪。队长叫他停下车回家避避雨，他却说运肥上地要紧，好催庄稼！
    共产党员耿永利，是怀柔县桥梓公社高各庄生产队的模范社员。他虽然年过五十，却干劲十足。最近队里开展秋季超产运动，要给晚玉米追灌一次大粪稀。耿永利干活从来不挑肥拣瘦，就自动向队长报名说：“我去赶车拉大粪。”耿永利总是说干就干，他牵着老黄牛，套上铁轮车，就到各家厕所掏大粪。由村里到地头往返二、三里地，他每天都送六、七趟。为了不耽误别人干活，他总是比别人起得早，提前把大粪稀运到地头的粪池。有时天下雨，他还照样干，队长和社员劝他避避雨，他说：“追肥是让庄稼吃饱，下雨能叫庄稼喝足水，为了秋季多收粮食，我淋点雨不算啥。”在耿永利的带动下，许多社员都加紧给庄稼施追肥，仅六天多时间，全队一百一十多亩晚玉米，全部灌上了一次大粪稀。
