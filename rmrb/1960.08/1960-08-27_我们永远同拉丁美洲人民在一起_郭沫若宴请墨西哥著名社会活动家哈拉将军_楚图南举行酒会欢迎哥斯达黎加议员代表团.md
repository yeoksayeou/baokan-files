He said that the Chinese people and the people of Latin America are of one heart. We will forever join hands with Latin America to fight against imperialism and defend world peace together.

In his toast, General Jara said, "I admire the work done by the Chinese people for the cause of peace. Our hearts are forever with the Chinese people. We have a common destiny, we are all threatened by imperialism, and we must fight together to defend peace and freedom." He raised his glass and said: "I wish the great Chinese people happiness, and I wish the Chinese people brilliant achievements under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise leader Chairman Mao Zedong."

Also present at the banquet were Bao Erhan, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and leading figures from various circles in the capital, including General Li Da, Dong Chuncai, Wu Han, Shen Jian, Wu Maosun, Wang Mingyuan, Yang Shuo, and Li Bingquan.

Chilean peace activist Mr. Venturi and his wife, who are in Beijing, and Argentinian peace activist Mr. Berrufo, who is also visiting our country, were also invited to the banquet.

Before the banquet, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, met with General Jara, Chairman of the Mexican National Peace Council, and Mr. José Rosales, who accompanied him, and had a cordial conversation.

Xinhua News Agency, 26th August: Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association, held a reception this evening to welcome all members of the Costa Rican Parliamentary Delegation who are currently visiting our country.

Chu Tunan spoke at the reception. He said that the visit of the Costa Rican Parliamentary Delegation is a support for the Chinese people. I firmly believe that through this friendly visit, the understanding and friendship between the people of our two countries will be enhanced. He said that despite the various obstacles imposed by US imperialism on the delegation's visit, you finally overcame the difficulties and came to our country. For this, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude and respect to our Costa Rican friends.

Chu Tunan said that the Chinese people have always stood for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and for the development of cultural and friendship relations on the basis of the Five Principles. The Chinese people resolutely support the struggles of the Costa Rican people, the Cuban people, and the people of all Latin American countries. The Chinese people will forever stand on the side of the people of all Latin American countries and fight to the end against our common enemy—US imperialism.

Chu Tunan also said that at the recent meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization of American States held in the capital of Costa Rica, US imperialism even plotted new conspiracies in an attempt to further arm the intervention of Cuba and divide and control Latin America. However, its conspiracy is destined to meet with shameful failure.

They said that we came to China for a friendly visit with the desire for peace and peaceful coexistence. We will return with a very affectionate feeling for the Chinese people. They expressed that after returning to their country, they will continue to strive for peaceful coexistence, for the progress and peace of the Costa Rican people.

Among those who attended today's reception were Zhang Su, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Deputy Secretaries-General Yu Xinqing and Lian Guan, Zhou Gengsheng, Vice-President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Erfu, Vice-President of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association, and other well-known figures from all walks of life.
