Albanian Newspapers Commemorate Publishing Festival
"Voice of the People" Editorial Emphasizes Persistence in Anti-Revisionist Struggle
    This newspaper dispatch Tirana. Albanian major cities began holding a book and magazine month on August 25th to celebrate the Albanian Publishing Festival – the anniversary of the founding of "Voice of the People" (August 25th).
    Eighteen years ago today, the Albanian Communist Party, engaged in a life-and-death struggle against fascism, published its first "Voice of the People" newspaper.
    The "Voice of the People" said in an editorial celebrating the festival that the role and prestige of our newspaper are constantly increasing at home and abroad. The Albanian people have boundless hatred for the conspiracies and activities of the aggressive and bellicose imperialists, and for the enemies of Marxism-Leninism, the socialist camp, and the entire international communist and workers' movement – the Yugoslav revisionists, who are tools of the imperialists. Our newspaper has become the expression of this hatred of the Albanian people. It has made every effort to expose the conspiracies of imperialism and Yugoslav modern revisionism.
    The "Unity Daily" editorial, in discussing the role of newspapers in the political and ideological fields, pointed out that newspapers introduce and explain important international issues to the working masses, publicize the Albanian Party and government's peaceful diplomatic policies, and tell readers about the invincible strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. It has played an important role in exposing the American warmongers and their loyal running dogs.
    The editorial also said: "Our newspaper holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, firmly defends the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, and has launched a correct and sharp struggle against the traitors to socialism – all kinds of opportunists, especially the Yugoslav revisionists."

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸纪念出版节
    “人民之声报”社论强调坚持反修正主义斗争
    本报讯　阿尔巴尼亚各主要城市从8月25日开始举行书刊月，以庆祝阿尔巴尼亚出版节——“人民之声报”创刊纪念日（8月25日）。
    在十八年前的今天，在同法西斯进行殊死斗争的阿尔巴尼亚共产党出版了第一张“人民之声报”。
      “人民之声报”在庆祝节日的社论中说，我们的报纸的作用和威信在国内外正在不断提高。阿尔巴尼亚人民无比憎恨侵略和好战的帝国主义者的阴谋和活动，以及帝国主义者的工具——马克思列宁主义、社会主义阵营以及整个国际共产主义运动和工人运动的敌人南斯拉夫修正主义。我们的报纸已成为阿尔巴尼亚人民的这种憎恨的表达者。它在揭露帝国主义、南斯拉夫现代修正主义的阴谋方面作出了一切努力。
    “团结报”的社论在谈到报纸在政治和思想领域中的作用时指出，报纸向劳动群众介绍和解释国际上的重大问题，宣传阿尔巴尼亚党和政府的和平外交政策，把以苏联为首的社会主义阵营不可战胜的力量告诉读者。它在揭露美国战争策动者及其忠顺的走狗方面起了重要的作用。
    社论还说：“我们的报纸高举马克思列宁主义旗帜，坚定地保卫马克思列宁主义的基本原则，并对社会主义的叛徒——各色各样的机会主义者，特别是南斯拉夫修正主义者开展了正确的、尖锐的斗争。”
