Manage Well, Use Well

    With the support of industry and other sectors for agriculture, more and more agricultural machinery is reaching rural areas. How to manage and use these agricultural machines well, and give full play to their effectiveness, is an important link in improving agricultural labor productivity, saving a lot of labor, and increasing grain production. It is also a major issue related to the entire technological transformation of agriculture.

    Houma City, Shanxi Province, attached importance to this issue early on, and they grasped this matter seriously and comprehensively. Party committees at all levels have a secretary responsible for this work, and a sound machinery repair and assembly network has been established, with planned training of technical personnel. In particular, they conducted in-depth work among mechanical operators, formulated and implemented a complete set of mechanical operation, maintenance, and evaluation and inspection systems, managing and using agricultural machinery well, and doubling efficiency. This is a good experience worthy of learning from all regions.

    管得好，用得好
    随着工业和各方面对农业的支援，逐渐有更多的农业机械到了农村。如何把这些农业机械管好、用好，充分发挥效能，这是提高农业的劳动生产率，节约大量劳动力和增产粮食的重要一环，也是关乎到整个农业技术改造的重大问题。
    山西省侯马市及早地重视了这个问题，他们认真地、全面地来抓这件事。各级党委都有一个书记负责这方面的工作，建立了健全的机械修配网，有计划地培养技术人员。特别是他们在机械操作人员中进行了深入的工作，制订和执行了一套完善的机械操作、养护和评比检查制度，把农业机械管得好，用得好，效率成倍地提高。这是一个值得各地学习的好经验。
