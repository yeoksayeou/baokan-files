Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang dispatch: Shenyang Fan Factory has launched a mass-based upsurge of compiling "Multi-Treasure Craft" technical demonstration competitions. The central content of the competition is to incorporate various complete sets of new technologies and new experiences into process regulations, in order to institutionalize and regularize their use. From mid-July to the present, through demonstration competitions, the factory has compiled 454 sets of "Multi-Treasure Crafts," accounting for about 80% of the total number of crafts to be compiled. The process of 60% of the products has been completely refreshed, achieving the "Multi-Treasure" goal of absorbing five to thirty treasures for each set of crafts, greatly promoting the production of the entire factory.

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement of Shenyang Fan Factory has been continuously deepening since the beginning of this year. From the beginning of the year to the end of April, after several revolutionary upsurges, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the entire factory has been greatly improved, basically eliminating heavy manual labor. Then, on the basis of large-scale promotion, consolidation, and improvement, the "Multi-Treasure Matching" movement was launched in early June, making new technologies and new experiences develop from the original single-item use to single-machine matching use. Within more than a month, all machine tools and other equipment in the factory were equipped with more than three kinds of new technologies and new experiences, and more than 90% of the workers became "Multi-Treasure Experts" mastering multiple new technologies and new experiences, playing a major role in ensuring the comprehensive over-fulfillment of the production plan for the first half of the year. Since late June, the factory's "Multi-Treasure Matching" movement has developed from single-machine matching to component production process matching; by early July, the production processes of most components were equipped with five to dozens of new technologies and new experiences. The result of this is that it eliminated the original imbalance in production processes after single-machine matching, and made the experience matching play a greater effect.

After the new technologies and new experiences matched according to the process are compiled into new crafts, they become the guideline for workers' operations, thereby effectively consolidating the new technologies and new experiences, and also making the process regulations more practical. The tin hanging process of the steel tube component of the large fan radiator newly produced by this factory originally required electric furnace treatment, but because this equipment could not be obtained for a while, it had to be processed in other factories; after this mass-based "Multi-Treasure Craft" movement, it absorbed the local methods created by the workers themselves, which can not only be processed, but also the processing efficiency is greatly improved compared with the plan. Because the process regulations for the production processes of most product components in the factory have been reformed, making the use of advanced experience regularized, the production efficiency has generally increased by 50%, and some have increased by one to four times. In July, on the basis of over-fulfilling the plan for the first half of the year, the entire factory achieved a comprehensive victory. Indicators such as output value, output, quality, variety, and cost all over-fulfilled the plan. Since August, there has been a new leap forward in the production of the entire factory.

In the process of compiling multi-treasure process regulations, Shenyang Fan Factory adopted the method of compiling, demonstrating, and improving at the same time, mobilizing all factory workers to demonstrate, and every process to demonstrate, forming a mass movement of catching up with each other throughout the factory. In half a month, 49 factory-level pacesetters and 200 workshop-level pacesetters appeared in the factory. About half of the workers have achieved the goal of "one is equal to two" through the compilation and implementation of "Multi-Treasure Crafts."

    沈阳扇风机厂开展编制“多宝工艺”技术表演赛
    把成套新技术纳入工艺规程
    已编出四百五十多套“多宝工艺”，百分之六十产品的工艺被刷新，大大促进了生产
    据新华社沈阳电　沈阳扇风机厂掀起群众性的编制“多宝工艺”技术表演赛热潮。竞赛的中心内容是把各种配成套的新技术新经验纳入工艺规程，做到使用制度化和经常化。从7月中旬到目前止，通过表演竞赛的方法，全厂已经编出“多宝工艺”四百五十四套，占应编工艺总数80％左右。60％的产品的工艺已经全部刷新，实现了每套工艺吸收五宝到三十宝的“多宝”目标，大大促进了全厂的生产。
    沈阳扇风机厂的技术革新和技术革命运动，今年以来一直在不断深入发展。从年初到4月末，经过了几个革命高潮，全厂机械化半机械化程度大大提高，基本上消除了笨重体力劳动。接着又在大推广、大巩固、大提高的基础上，在6月初掀起了“多宝配套”运动，使新技术新经验由原来的单项使用发展到单机配套使用，在一个多月的时间之内全厂所有机床和其它设备，都配上了三种以上的新技术和新经验，90％以上的工人成了掌握多种新技术新经验的“多宝能手”，对保证全面超额完成上半年生产计划起了重大作用。6月下旬以来，全厂的“多宝配套”运动又由单机配套发展到按部件生产工序配套；到7月上旬为止，大部分部件的生产工序都配上了五种到几十种新技术新经验。这样做的结果，消除了原来单机配套后各个工序生产不平衡的现象，使经验配套发挥了更巨大的效果。
    按工序配起的新技术新经验编成新工艺以后，成了职工们操作的准绳，从而有效地巩固了新技术新经验，同时也使工艺规程更加切合实际。这个厂新生产的大型风机散热片钢管部件的挂锡工序，原来工艺要用电炉处理，因一时弄不到这项设备，要到外厂才能加工；经过这次群众性的编制“多宝工艺”运动，吸收了工人自己创造的土办法，不但可以加工，而且加工效率也比计划大为提高。由于全厂大部分产品部件生产工序的工艺规程实现革新，做到了先进经验使用经常化，生产效率普遍提高50％，有的提高了一倍到四倍。7月份全厂在超额全面完成上半年计划的基础上，又获得了全面胜利。产值、产量、质量、品种、成本等项指标都超额完成了计划。8月份以来，全厂生产又有新的跃进。
    沈阳扇风机厂在编制多宝工艺规程中，采取了边编制、边表演、边改进的办法，发动全厂职工人人表演，道道工序表演，形成了全厂性你追我赶的群众性运动。半个月中，全厂就出现厂级标兵四十九名，车间级标兵二百名，有一半左右的工人通过编制和贯彻“多宝工艺”，实现了“一顶二”的目标。
