Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th (TASS): The Soviet government's statement: The current situation in the Congo "is completely unacceptable, and it will only undermine the prestige of the United Nations, which has already passed a resolution on stopping the aggression against this country." In the statement, the Soviet government believes that the "symbolic" withdrawal of a small number of interventionist troops is a trick to appease and deceive world public opinion.

The statement emphasized that the Soviet government advocates that strict and effective measures must be taken to immediately implement the Security Council's decision. To this end, it suggests:

    -- All Belgian troops must be withdrawn from the territory of the Republic of the Congo within the shortest possible time, and any means of influence can be used without hesitation for this purpose.
    -- If the current army headquarters continues to disregard the Security Council's decision (which mandates that it can only take actions agreed to by the government of the Republic of the Congo and provide the government with the necessary military assistance), then this headquarters should be replaced and a new headquarters appointed.
    -- Immediately take resolute and effective measures to stop the occupation of Katanga Province, an indivisible part of the Republic of the Congo.
    -- If the troops sent to the Congo under the Security Council's decision are unable to effectively guarantee the expulsion of the interventionist forces, then the troops of those countries willing to participate in the realization of this just action should be sent to the Republic of the Congo.

The Soviet government's statement believes that the Security Council's decision requiring Belgian troops to withdraw from the territory of the Republic of the Congo has not been implemented. Belgian troops still illegally occupy Congolese cities and settlements, especially Katanga Province, where someone is continuing to implement a conspiracy to separate it from the Republic of the Congo by taking advantage of the conditions of occupation and emergency state.

The Soviet government's statement says that the actions of the United Nations troop headquarters have caused serious unease. These troops have not been used to fulfill their mission. The headquarters has sent these troops to provinces and cities that are fighting against the Belgian aggressors and are under the control of the legitimate Congolese government.

    就刚果当前局势
    苏联政府再次发表声明
    新华社6日讯　塔斯社莫斯科6日电：苏联政府声明：刚果当前的局势“是完全不能容许的，它只会破坏曾经通过关于制止侵略这个国家的决定的联合国的威信”。苏联政府在声明中认为，干涉军小量部队的“象征性”的撤退，是为了平息和欺骗世界舆论而耍的花招。
    声明着重说，苏联政府主张必须采取严格和有效的措施来立即履行安全理事会的决定。为此，它建议：
    ——要所有比利时军队在最短期间内立即撤出刚果共和国领土，为此可以毫不犹豫地使用任何影响手段。
    ——如果现在的军队司令部今后仍然不遵守安理会的决定（决定责成它只能采取刚果共和国政府同意的行动并给予这个政府必要的军事援助），那末应当撤换这个司令部并指派新的司令部。
    ——立即采取坚决有效的措施来制止占领刚果共和国不可分割的一部分——加丹加省。
    ——如果根据安理会的决定派往刚果的军队没有能力有效地保证驱逐干涉军，那末就把那些愿意参加实现这一正义行动的国家的军队派往刚果共和国。
    苏联政府的声明认为，安理会要求比利时军队撤出刚果共和国领土的决定没有得到执行。比利时军队仍然非法地占领着刚果城市和居民点，特别是加丹加省，在加丹加省，有人正在利用占领和紧急状态的条件继续施展把它从刚果共和国分割出去的阴谋。
    苏联政府的声明说，联合国军队司令部的行为引起了严重的不安。这些军队都没有被用来履行自己的使命。司令部把这些军队派到那些正在对比利时侵略者进行斗争并处于合法的刚果政府控制下的省份和城市中去。
