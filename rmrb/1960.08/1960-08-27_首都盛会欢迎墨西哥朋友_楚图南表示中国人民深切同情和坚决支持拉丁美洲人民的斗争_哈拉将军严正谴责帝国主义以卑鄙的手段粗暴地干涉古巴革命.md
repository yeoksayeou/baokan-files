Xinhua News Agency, 26th - More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in the capital gathered at the CPPCC Auditorium today to warmly welcome the famous Mexican social activist and Chairman of the Mexican National Peace Council, General Heriberto Jara.

Chu Tunan, President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association, said at the meeting that the struggle of the Mexican people, neighboring the United States, is an important part of the current struggle of the Latin American people against American interference and in defense of national sovereignty. The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and firmly supported the struggle of the Latin American people. In the struggle against the common enemy of American imperialism and in defense of world peace, the 650 million Chinese people will always stand with the Latin American people.

General Jara, who was warmly welcomed, sternly condemned in his speech the imperialists' destruction and interference in the struggle of the Latin American people and the Cuban revolution. He said that the heroic Cuban people would rather die than be deprived of their new life. "The fate of the Cuban people is the fate of all the people of Latin American countries, and also the fate of all the so-called weak nations in the world. Therefore, defending the Cuban people is defending ourselves."

General Jara said that the Cuban revolution is completely just. The Cuban people are determined to defend their motherland to the death. They should be supported and assisted. He said, "The responsibility for this support rests with all people in the world who love peace, freedom, and true democracy."

Today's meeting was jointly organized by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and the China-Latin America Friendship Association.

The meeting was presided over by Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. In his welcoming speech, Chu Tunan first extended a warm welcome to General Jara, a friend of the Chinese people who had come from afar, and Mr. Jos√© Rosales, editor of the Mexican magazine "Eternal," who accompanied him. Chu Tunan said that the Chinese and Mexican people have a deep friendship. General Jara's visit to China will undoubtedly further promote and deepen the friendship between the two peoples. He said, please ask General Jara to bring the friendship of the 650 million Chinese people to the Mexican people.

Chu Tunan warmly praised General Jara for his unremitting efforts to defend world peace. He said that General Jara upholds justice, condemning US imperialism's arms expansion, war preparations, and interference in the internal affairs of other countries; supporting the people of all countries in their struggle for independence, and cheering for the victory of the Cuban people. General Jara was pleased with the victory of the Chinese people, repeatedly congratulated the Chinese people on their achievements, and warmly cared about the socialist construction of the Chinese people.

Chu Tunan said that the Chinese and Mexican people have a deep friendship, and have had cultural exchanges and economic exchanges for a long time. Although US imperialism is now doing everything possible to obstruct it, the friendly ties between the Chinese and Mexican people cannot be severed.

When talking about the vigorous development of the national democratic movement in Latin America, Chu Tunan emphasized that the victory of the Cuban revolution has brought about a major change in the struggle situation throughout Latin America. The heroic Cuban people have raised the banner of distinct national independence high. Over the past year, they have defeated various threats and interferences from US imperialism, resolutely defended national sovereignty, set a brilliant example for the struggle of the people of all Latin American countries, and won the sympathy and support of progressive humanity around the world.

Chu Tunan concluded by saying that the Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and firmly supported the struggle of the Latin American people. We have suffered from long-term imperialist aggression, oppression, and plunder in the past. Today, US imperialism still occupies our Taiwan and continues to carry out military provocations and war threats against our country. The same experiences and common struggles have linked our hearts together and united our strength. The Chinese people will always regard the struggle and victory of the Latin American people as their own struggle and victory.

General Jara delivered a long speech amidst warm applause. He enthusiastically praised the achievements of the great Chinese people and extended brotherly respect to the Chinese people on behalf of the Latin American people and the Mexican people. General Jara said that in Mexico, we have known the compatriots of the Chinese people for many years. We respect their character and diligence. We understand the heroic liberation struggle of the Chinese people until the establishment of the new People's Republic.

He said: "I have long known in distant places the amazing achievements you have made since the founding of the country after defeating domestic enemies and stopping foreign enemies; those enemies did not want China to be free, did not want to see China become the master of its own destiny, but wanted China to be tamely exploited by foreign imperialism. "But now I have come to the land of China and have personally seen the great achievements the Chinese people have made in the ten years since the founding of the People's Republic. Ten years are only a moment in human history." He pointed out, "This is a victorious march of 600 million brothers, which cannot be stopped by any force. The threat of missile launch bases cannot stop them from moving forward. The slander of the imperialist newspapers is useless, and the conspiracies of the political and military departments of the warmongers are of no avail." General Jara said: "China advocates peace, loves peace, and strives for peace. As she has stated many times, and as recently stated at the Tokyo Conference, she, like all peace-loving people in the world, and like the Latin American people want, hopes that all international disputes, no matter how complex, will be resolved through peaceful consultations."

The outstanding Mexican peace fighter emphasized that "China is not aggressive, she has never wanted to invade anyone, but if she needs to defend herself, to defend the status of a truly free people, you can count on every Chinese to be a soldier, ready to fight alongside the heroic Red Army whenever the motherland is in danger."

General Jara said: "China is making unremitting efforts to destroy weapons of mass destruction and to stop the arms race. Warmongers are pushing the people of all countries into the arms race and bringing great harm to the people. China is working to stop the Cold War, which is spreading the seeds of terror and suspicion and becoming an obstacle to friendship between the people of all countries. China is working for complete disarmament, for the free cultural and trade exchanges that benefit the whole world."

General Jara also praised: "The Chinese people, like the peace-loving and human rights-respecting people of all other countries in the world, just like we Latin American people who love peace and human rights, also demand respect for the right of self-determination of the people of all countries, so that the people of these countries can freely choose the political system that is most suitable for them. Like us Latin American people, they do not allow foreign interference in the internal affairs of any country's people, and do not allow any obstruction in any way to the struggle of the people of all countries for true independence." He stressed that this true independence must be based on economic independence.

He insisted that the People's Republic of China should occupy its rightful place in the United Nations organization, and should not allow the representatives of the traitorous group fleeing in Taiwan to occupy this position.

In his speech, General Jara condemned: "Imperialism talks a lot about its democracy, but it does not practice democracy, let alone wants the people of other countries to live in true democracy, and does not want the people of so-called small countries to achieve their true economic independence, so that it can continue to exploit these people." He said that imperialism describes the people's desire for liberation as a serious communist crisis, and it even uses the most despicable means to crack down on the just aspirations of the people of all countries. Imperialism has made a rude attack on the heroic Cuban people, slandering it, imposing an economic blockade on it, and even constantly threatening it with the most serious interference.

General Jara accused that the imperialists' bad attitude clearly proves that what they want to defend are the large plantations and monopoly capital enterprises that have been exploiting for many years, not the legitimate interests of the whole people of a country; it also proves that as long as imperialism is allowed to exploit unscrupulously, they do not care who is in power in the government, especially in Latin America.

He pointed out that in Cuba, "the crime against humanity is that planes taking off from the southern United States burned large areas of sugar cane fields, which means burning the bread of the Cuban people; the crime against humanity is also that a plane taking off from the southern United States strafed unarmed people in Havana. This incident was witnessed by me and my little granddaughter two hundred meters away."

He angrily condemned, "All these inhumane and terrifying actions to intimidate the Cuban people and force the Cuban people to abandon their government and their new life are to make Cuba fall into the clutches of imperialism again. However, they have not been able to scare Cuba, nor have they been able to alienate the close relationship between the Cuban people and their leaders. On the contrary, it has made the Cuban people stand up more heroically and defend the victory of their revolution with more determination. This revolution has opened up a broad road for the Cuban people to a bright future and to the new life they are experiencing."

Finally, this peace fighter from Latin America firmly said, "The Chinese people and the Cuban people will never be wiped out. They will forever continue to move towards a bright future. Together with the people of other countries, they will win the lasting peace we desire."

General Jara's speeches constantly won stormy and enthusiastic applause from the audience.

Also present at today's meeting were Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Zhang Zhixiang, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Zhou Erfu, Vice President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association, and people from all walks of life in the capital, including General Li Da, Sun Xiaocun, Shen Jian, Li Bingquan, Wang Mingyuan, and Wu Maosun.

Chilean peace activist Manuel Venturieri and other Latin American friends who are visiting our country were also invited to attend the meeting.
