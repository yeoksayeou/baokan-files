Xinhua News Agency, 26th - More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in the capital gathered at the CPPCC Auditorium today to warmly welcome the famous Mexican social activist and Chairman of the Mexican National Peace Council, General Heriberto Jara.

Chu Tunan, President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association, said at the meeting that the struggle of the Mexican people, neighboring the United States, is an important part of the current struggle of the Latin American people against American interference and in defense of national sovereignty. The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and firmly supported the struggle of the Latin American people. In the struggle against the common enemy of American imperialism and in defense of world peace, the 650 million Chinese people will always stand with the Latin American people.

General Jara, who was warmly welcomed, sternly condemned in his speech the imperialists' destruction and interference in the struggle of the Latin American people and the Cuban revolution. He said that the heroic Cuban people would rather die than be deprived of their new life. "The fate of the Cuban people is the fate of all the people of Latin American countries, and also the fate of all the so-called weak nations in the world. Therefore, defending the Cuban people is defending ourselves."

General Jara said that the Cuban revolution is completely just. The Cuban people are determined to defend their motherland to the death. They should be supported and assisted. He said, "The responsibility for this support rests with all people in the world who love peace, freedom, and true democracy."

Today's meeting was jointly organized by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and the China-Latin America Friendship Association.

The meeting was presided over by Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. In his welcoming speech, Chu Tunan first extended a warm welcome to General Jara, a friend of the Chinese people who had come from afar, and Mr. José Rosales, editor of the Mexican magazine "Eternal," who accompanied him. Chu Tunan said that the Chinese and Mexican people have a deep friendship. General Jara's visit to China will undoubtedly further promote and deepen the friendship between the two peoples. He said, please ask General Jara to bring the friendship of the 650 million Chinese people to the Mexican people.

Chu Tunan warmly praised General Jara for his unremitting efforts to defend world peace. He said that General Jara upholds justice, condemning US imperialism's arms expansion, war preparations, and interference in the internal affairs of other countries; supporting the people of all countries in their struggle for independence, and cheering for the victory of the Cuban people. General Jara was pleased with the victory of the Chinese people, repeatedly congratulated the Chinese people on their achievements, and warmly cared about the socialist construction of the Chinese people.

Chu Tunan said that the Chinese and Mexican people have a deep friendship, and have had cultural exchanges and economic exchanges for a long time. Although US imperialism is now doing everything possible to obstruct it, the friendly ties between the Chinese and Mexican people cannot be severed.

When talking about the vigorous development of the national democratic movement in Latin America, Chu Tunan emphasized that the victory of the Cuban revolution has brought about a major change in the struggle situation throughout Latin America. The heroic Cuban people have raised the banner of distinct national independence high. Over the past year, they have defeated various threats and interferences from US imperialism, resolutely defended national sovereignty, set a brilliant example for the struggle of the people of all Latin American countries, and won the sympathy and support of progressive humanity around the world.

Chu Tunan concluded by saying that the Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and firmly supported the struggle of the Latin American people. We have suffered from long-term imperialist aggression, oppression, and plunder in the past. Today, US imperialism still occupies our Taiwan and continues to carry out military provocations and war threats against our country. The same experiences and common struggles have linked our hearts together and united our strength. The Chinese people will always regard the struggle and victory of the Latin American people as their own struggle and victory.

General Jara delivered a long speech amidst warm applause. He enthusiastically praised the achievements of the great Chinese people and extended brotherly respect to the Chinese people on behalf of the Latin American people and the Mexican people. General Jara said that in Mexico, we have known the compatriots of the Chinese people for many years. We respect their character and diligence. We understand the heroic liberation struggle of the Chinese people until the establishment of the new People's Republic.

He said: "I have long known in distant places the amazing achievements you have made since the founding of the country after defeating domestic enemies and stopping foreign enemies; those enemies did not want China to be free, did not want to see China become the master of its own destiny, but wanted China to be tamely exploited by foreign imperialism. "But now I have come to the land of China and have personally seen the great achievements the Chinese people have made in the ten years since the founding of the People's Republic. Ten years are only a moment in human history." He pointed out, "This is a victorious march of 600 million brothers, which cannot be stopped by any force. The threat of missile launch bases cannot stop them from moving forward. The slander of the imperialist newspapers is useless, and the conspiracies of the political and military departments of the warmongers are of no avail." General Jara said: "China advocates peace, loves peace, and strives for peace. As she has stated many times, and as recently stated at the Tokyo Conference, she, like all peace-loving people in the world, and like the Latin American people want, hopes that all international disputes, no matter how complex, will be resolved through peaceful consultations."

The outstanding Mexican peace fighter emphasized that "China is not aggressive, she has never wanted to invade anyone, but if she needs to defend herself, to defend the status of a truly free people, you can count on every Chinese to be a soldier, ready to fight alongside the heroic Red Army whenever the motherland is in danger."

General Jara said: "China is making unremitting efforts to destroy weapons of mass destruction and to stop the arms race. Warmongers are pushing the people of all countries into the arms race and bringing great harm to the people. China is working to stop the Cold War, which is spreading the seeds of terror and suspicion and becoming an obstacle to friendship between the people of all countries. China is working for complete disarmament, for the free cultural and trade exchanges that benefit the whole world."

General Jara also praised: "The Chinese people, like the peace-loving and human rights-respecting people of all other countries in the world, just like we Latin American people who love peace and human rights, also demand respect for the right of self-determination of the people of all countries, so that the people of these countries can freely choose the political system that is most suitable for them. Like us Latin American people, they do not allow foreign interference in the internal affairs of any country's people, and do not allow any obstruction in any way to the struggle of the people of all countries for true independence." He stressed that this true independence must be based on economic independence.

He insisted that the People's Republic of China should occupy its rightful place in the United Nations organization, and should not allow the representatives of the traitorous group fleeing in Taiwan to occupy this position.

In his speech, General Jara condemned: "Imperialism talks a lot about its democracy, but it does not practice democracy, let alone wants the people of other countries to live in true democracy, and does not want the people of so-called small countries to achieve their true economic independence, so that it can continue to exploit these people." He said that imperialism describes the people's desire for liberation as a serious communist crisis, and it even uses the most despicable means to crack down on the just aspirations of the people of all countries. Imperialism has made a rude attack on the heroic Cuban people, slandering it, imposing an economic blockade on it, and even constantly threatening it with the most serious interference.

General Jara accused that the imperialists' bad attitude clearly proves that what they want to defend are the large plantations and monopoly capital enterprises that have been exploiting for many years, not the legitimate interests of the whole people of a country; it also proves that as long as imperialism is allowed to exploit unscrupulously, they do not care who is in power in the government, especially in Latin America.

He pointed out that in Cuba, "the crime against humanity is that planes taking off from the southern United States burned large areas of sugar cane fields, which means burning the bread of the Cuban people; the crime against humanity is also that a plane taking off from the southern United States strafed unarmed people in Havana. This incident was witnessed by me and my little granddaughter two hundred meters away."

He angrily condemned, "All these inhumane and terrifying actions to intimidate the Cuban people and force the Cuban people to abandon their government and their new life are to make Cuba fall into the clutches of imperialism again. However, they have not been able to scare Cuba, nor have they been able to alienate the close relationship between the Cuban people and their leaders. On the contrary, it has made the Cuban people stand up more heroically and defend the victory of their revolution with more determination. This revolution has opened up a broad road for the Cuban people to a bright future and to the new life they are experiencing."

Finally, this peace fighter from Latin America firmly said, "The Chinese people and the Cuban people will never be wiped out. They will forever continue to move towards a bright future. Together with the people of other countries, they will win the lasting peace we desire."

General Jara's speeches constantly won stormy and enthusiastic applause from the audience.

Also present at today's meeting were Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Zhang Zhixiang, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Zhou Erfu, Vice President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association, and people from all walks of life in the capital, including General Li Da, Sun Xiaocun, Shen Jian, Li Bingquan, Wang Mingyuan, and Wu Maosun.

Chilean peace activist Manuel Venturieri and other Latin American friends who are visiting our country were also invited to attend the meeting.

    首都盛会欢迎墨西哥朋友
    楚图南表示中国人民深切同情和坚决支持拉丁美洲人民的斗争
    哈拉将军严正谴责帝国主义以卑鄙的手段粗暴地干涉古巴革命
    新华社26日讯　首都各界人民一千多人今天在政协礼堂集会，热烈欢迎墨西哥著名社会活动家、墨西哥全国和平理事会主席埃里维尔托·哈拉将军。
    中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南在会上说，毗邻美国的墨西哥人民的斗争，是当前拉丁美洲人民反对美国干涉，保卫民族主权的斗争的一个重要组成部分，中国人民一贯深切同情和坚决支持拉丁美洲人民的斗争。在反对共同敌人美帝国主义、保卫世界和平的斗争中，六亿五千万中国人民永远同拉丁美洲人民站在一起。
    受到热烈欢迎的哈拉将军，在讲话中严正地谴责了帝国主义者对拉丁美洲人民的斗争、对古巴革命的破坏和干涉，他说，英勇的古巴人民宁死也不愿被剥夺他们的新生活，“古巴人民的命运就是全拉丁美洲各国人民的命运，也是全世界所谓弱小民族的命运。因此保卫古巴人民就是保卫我们自己”。
    哈拉将军说，古巴的革命是完全正义的。古巴人民誓死保卫祖国，他们的决心是那么坚定。他们应该得到支持和援助。他说，“这种支援的责任是全世界爱好和平、自由与真正的民主的人们的责任。”
    今天的大会是由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国拉丁美洲友好协会联合举办的。
    大会由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席包尔汉主持。楚图南在致欢迎词时首先向远道而来的中国人民的朋友哈拉将军和他同来的墨西哥“永恒”杂志编辑何塞·罗萨莱斯先生表示热烈欢迎。楚图南说，中国同墨西哥人民有着深厚的友谊。哈拉将军这次来中国访问，无疑地将更进一步促进和加深两国人民的友谊。他说，请哈拉将军把六亿五千万中国人民的友情带给墨西哥人民。
    楚图南热情赞扬哈拉将军为保卫世界和平所作的不懈努力，他说，哈拉将军主持正义，他曾谴责美帝国主义扩军备战和干涉别国内政；支持各国人民争取独立的运动，并为古巴人民的胜利而欢呼。哈拉将军曾为中国人民的胜利而感到高兴，一再祝贺中国人民的成就，并热情地关心中国人民的社会主义建设。
    楚图南说，中墨两国人民有着深厚的友谊，很久以前就有着文化交流和经济来往。尽管美帝国主义现在百般阻挠，但是，中墨两国人民的友好联系是割不断的。
    楚图南在谈到拉丁美洲的民族民主运动的蓬勃发展时着重指出，古巴革命的胜利使整个拉丁美洲的斗争形势起了重大的变化，英雄的古巴人民高高地举起了鲜明的民族独立的旗帜。一年多来，他们击败了美帝国主义的各种威胁和干涉，坚决地保卫了民族主权，为拉丁美洲各国人民的斗争树立了光辉榜样，得到了全世界进步人类的同情和支援。
    楚图南最后说，中国人民一贯深切同情和坚决支持拉丁美洲人民的斗争。我们过去受过帝国主义长期的侵略、压迫和掠夺，今天美帝国主义还霸占着我国的台湾，不断对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。相同的经历和共同的斗争，把我们的心连结在一起，把我们的力量团结在一起。中国人民把拉丁美洲人民的斗争和胜利永远看作是自己的斗争和胜利。
    哈拉将军在热烈的掌声中发表了长篇讲话。他满怀热情地赞扬伟大中国人民的成就，并代表拉丁美洲人民、墨西哥人民向中国人民致兄弟般的敬意。哈拉将军说，在墨西哥，多年来我们就熟知中国人民的侨胞，我们尊重他们的品德和勤劳，我们了解中国人民英勇的解放斗争，直到新的人民共和国的建立。
    他说：“我在遥远的地方早就知道你们在战胜了国内的敌人和制止了国外的敌人之后，建国以来所取得的惊人的成就；那些敌人不愿让中国自由，不愿看到中国成为自己命运的主人，而希望中国驯服地受外国帝国主义的剥削。“但是，我现在来到中国的土地上亲眼看到中国人民在人民共和国成立的十年以来所取得的巨大成就，十年在人类的历史上只不过是一瞬间。”他指出，“这是六亿兄弟胜利的进军，是任何力量都阻挡不住的。导弹发射基地的威胁阻挡不了他们前进。帝国主义报纸的诬蔑毫无用处，好战分子的政治和军事部门的阴谋诡计也无济于事。”哈拉将军说：“中国主张和平，热爱和平，并为和平而努力。正如她多次表明，以及最近在东京会议上所表明的，她与全世界爱好和平的人民一样，与拉丁美洲人民所愿望的一样，希望一切国际争端，不论如何复杂，都通过和平协商取得解决。”
    这位墨西哥的杰出的和平战士强调指出，“中国不是侵略性的，她从来不想侵犯任何人，但是，如果需要保卫自己，保卫真正的自由人民的地位，可以指望每一个中国人都是战士，一旦祖国遭到危难的时候，随时都准备和英勇的红军并肩作战。”
    哈拉将军说：“中国坚持不懈地为销毁大规模杀人武器而努力，为停止军备竞赛而努力，好战者把各国人民推进军备竞赛中，并给人民带来了巨大的损害。中国在为停止冷战而努力，冷战在散布恐怖和猜疑的种子，成为各国人民之间的友谊的障碍。中国在为全面裁军而努力，在为使全世界受益的自由的文化和贸易交流而努力。”
    哈拉将军还赞扬说：“中国人民像全世界其他各国爱好和平、尊重人权的人民一样，也正如我们热爱和平和人权的拉丁美洲人民一样，要求尊重各国人民的自决权，以便这些国家的人民能够自由地选择最适合于他们的政治制度。正如我们拉丁美洲人民一样，他们不容许外国干涉任何国家人民的内政，不容许以任何方式阻碍各国人民为争取真正的独立而进行的斗争。”他强调，这种真正的独立必须以经济独立为基础。
    他坚持说，中华人民共和国应该在联合国组织中占有它应有的地位，而不能让逃窜在台湾的叛国集团的代表盘踞在这个位置上。
    哈拉将军在讲话中谴责说：“帝国主义大谈其民主，但却不实行民主，更不愿意让其他国家人民在真正的民主中生活，不愿让所谓的弱小国家人民取得他们真正的经济独立，以便可以继续剥削这些人民”。他说，帝国主义把各国人民解放的愿望说成是严重的共产主义的危机，它甚至使用了各种最卑鄙的手段来打击各国人民的正当愿望。帝国主义向英勇的古巴人民作了粗暴的打击，污蔑它，对它实行经济封锁，以致不断地用最严重的干涉来威胁它。
    哈拉将军指责说，帝国主义者的恶劣的态度明显地证明，他们要保卫的是多年来进行剥削的大庄园和垄断资本企业，而不是一个国家全民的正当的利益；也证明了，只要容许帝国主义肆无忌惮的剥削，政府中是谁执政，他们全不管，特别是在拉丁美洲。
    他指出，在古巴，“伤害人类的罪行是从美国南部起飞的飞机焚烧大片的甘蔗田，这就意味着焚烧古巴人民的面包，伤害人类的罪行也还有从美国南部起飞一架飞机就在哈瓦那扫射手无寸铁的人民。这件事是我和我的一个小孙女在二百公尺之外所亲眼看到的。”
    他愤怒地谴责说，“所有这一切恐吓古巴人民、迫使古巴人民抛弃他们的政府和他们的新生活而进行的非人道的、恐怖的行动，就是要使古巴重新落入帝国主义的魔掌。但是，他们并没有能够吓倒古巴，也没有能够离间古巴人民和他们的领导人之间的密切关系。相反地，使古巴人民更英勇地站立起来，并以更加坚定的决心来保卫他们革命的胜利，这个革命为古巴人民打开了通向一个美好的前途、通向他们正在体会到的新生活的康庄大道。”
    最后，这位来自拉丁美洲的和平战士坚定地说，“中国人民和古巴人民都永远也不会被消灭。他们要永远继续朝着光明的前途迈进。和其他各国人民一起，他们将赢得我们渴望的持久和平。”
    哈拉将军的这些讲话，不断地博得了全场暴风雨般的热烈的掌声。
    出席今天大会的还有，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席陈叔通，中国人民对外文化协会副会长张致祥，中国拉丁美洲友好协会副会长周而复，以及首都各方面人士李达上将、孙晓村、申健、李炳泉、王明远、吴茂荪等。
    在京的智利和平人士万徒勒里和正在我国访问的其他拉丁美洲的朋友也应邀出席了大会。
