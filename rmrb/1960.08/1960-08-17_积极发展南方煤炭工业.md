Actively Develop the Southern Coal Industry

To carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, we must focus on grain and steel. On the industrial front, to produce more steel, we must produce more coal. This issue is particularly important for the southern provinces, where coal production is still low. With coal, there is iron; with iron, there is steel. In some southern provinces, coal has become the decisive link in increasing steel production. At the same time, coal is an important raw material for the chemical industry. Increased coal production prepares the ground for producing more fertilizer to support agriculture. Therefore, actively developing the coal industry in the southern provinces not only has long-term significance for rational distribution but also has the practical significance of ensuring the smooth progress of the campaign to increase production and practice economy.

The South needs coal, but can the Southern coal industry develop rapidly? To answer this question, we must first answer whether there is coal in the South. At one time, some people believed that "there is no coal in the South." This argument has been refuted by the great practice of the Great Leap Forward for more than two years. The fact that Guangdong, Fujian, and other places have vigorously run small indigenous and small modern coal industries proves that the South not only has coal, but also has abundant reserves. It is certain that the South has coal, but is the mining value high? Some people also used to think that the southern coalfields have many faults and thin coal seams, and have no mining value. This statement was also refuted by the news published in this newspaper on July 27 about the high-speed development of the coal industry in Guangdong Province. Guangdong Province, after only two years, has jumped from a situation where almost all of its coal relied on supplies from the North to a situation where most of it can be self-sufficient. If Guangdong's coal mines "have no mining value," could this be achieved? Of course not.

If the southern provinces can all be like Guangdong, and some major industrial sectors can achieve mostly self-sufficiency in coal, it will create extremely favorable conditions for carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. At the same time, producing more coal in the South can greatly reduce the amount of coal transported from the North to the South, saving a lot of transportation capacity for transporting materials needed to support agriculture and other industrial production, and promoting the development of agricultural and industrial production. Reducing the amount of coal transported from the North to the South can also increase the supply of coal in the North, promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production in the North. It can be seen that there are many benefits to actively developing the coal industry in the South.

How can the southern coal industry be developed rapidly? According to Guangdong's experience, the basic principle is to adhere to the "walking on two legs" policy. While building a certain number of modern large and medium-sized mines, vigorously running small indigenous and small modern coal mines can develop the coal industry in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. To develop the coal industry in areas where the coal industry base is relatively weak, if you want to be fast, you must not be greedy for big and foreign things, and you must grasp the "small" and "indigenous". Why can Guangdong be fast? It is because in 1958, it vigorously ran small indigenous coal groups and opened more than 8,000 small coal kilns. On this basis, after the transformation and improvement in 1959, the seedlings grew into small trees. Now, many small coal kilns have transitioned to small modern groups, and some have moved towards medium modern groups. In the past two years, the province's coal production has suddenly increased fivefold, indicating the infinite vitality of small indigenous and small modern coal mines. Obviously, Guangdong's experience is also applicable to other southern provinces. Vigorously running small modern and small indigenous coal mines is not only fast, but also most suitable for the specific conditions in the South, such as the relatively complex coal geological conditions and the relatively dispersed coal resources. In this case, adopting the method of exploring, building, and producing at the same time can promote the rapid development of small modern and small indigenous coal mines. These small modern and small indigenous coal mines, after rectification, consolidation, and technical transformation, may gradually develop into modern mines, laying the foundation for the Southern coal industry and laying the foundation for the rational distribution of the coal industry nationwide.

Southern provinces must implement the policy of self-reliance and running enterprises diligently and thriftily in developing the coal industry. This is a most basic measure for developing the Southern coal industry. Developing the coal industry in the Southern provinces will encounter some difficulties, but as long as we are determined, many ways to overcome difficulties will emerge. Of course, emphasizing self-reliance does not mean that we do not need any support and cooperation from relevant departments. Due to the relatively complex geological conditions of the southern coalfields and the poor equipment and technical conditions, under possible conditions, the geological departments need to vigorously support the exploration of coalfield geology, and the mechanical industry departments need to support equipment and technical forces. Necessary support and cooperation should also be carried out between regions. Some areas that have not found coal resources for the time being can cooperate with areas that have discovered coal resources and make reasonable arrangements in terms of funds, labor, equipment, and cadres to jointly build a number of small mines. These necessary support and cooperation will greatly promote the construction of the Southern coal industry.

Developing the coal industry in the Southern provinces is a new construction undertaking, and of course it cannot be accomplished overnight. Therefore, we must promote a down-to-earth work style, take practical and feasible measures, and solve specific problems one by one. In construction, we must distinguish between priorities and concentrate our efforts to fight annihilation battles. We must adopt the method of building a batch, consolidating a batch, and improving a batch in a planned and step-by-step manner, so that each coal mine can quickly exert its production capacity. The development of the Southern coal industry has great prospects. As long as we firmly establish the ambition to change the coal shortage in the South, firmly implement the policy of walking on two legs, and take practical and specific measures, we can rapidly increase the coal production in the South in a short period of time. A mass movement to vigorously run small indigenous and small modern coal groups has already been launched in the Southern provinces. This is an important aspect of the campaign to increase production and practice economy on the industrial front in the Southern provinces, and we should actively do this work quickly and well.

### 积极发展南方煤炭工业

    积极发展南方煤炭工业
    开展增产节约运动要以粮、钢为中心。在工业战线上，要增产更多的钢铁，就要增产更多的煤炭。这个问题对于煤炭产量尚少的南方各省来说，尤其重要。有了煤，才有铁，有了铁，才有钢，在南方一些省份，煤，成了增产钢铁的决定性环节。同时，煤，又是化学工业的重要原料。煤增产了，就为增产更多的化肥支援农业准备了条件。所以积极发展南方各省的煤炭工业，不仅有合理布局的长远意义，而且就目前来说，也有保证增产节约运动顺利进行的现实意义。
    南方需煤，可是南方煤炭工业能不能迅速发展呢？要回答这个问题，首先要回答南方有没有煤。曾经一度有人认为“南方无煤”。这个论调，经过两年多大跃进的伟大实践，已经被驳倒了。广东、福建等地大办小土群、小洋群煤炭工业的事实证明：南方不仅有煤，而且蕴藏量也很丰富。南方有煤，这是肯定了，但是开采价值大不大呢？也曾经有人认为：南方煤田断层多、煤层薄，没有什么开采价值。这个说法，也被本报7月27日发表的广东省高速度发展煤炭工业的新闻，有力地驳倒了。广东省仅仅经过两年时间，就从原来用煤几乎全部依靠北方供应的状况，一跃而为大部分可以自给的局面。如果广东的煤矿“没有什么开采价值”，能做到这一点吗？当然是不可能的。
    南方各省，如果都能像广东一样，一些主要的工业部门用煤作到大部自给，就为开展增产节约运动，创造了一个极为有利的条件。同时，南方多生产一些煤炭，还能大大减少北煤南运，节省出大量运输力用来运输支援农业和其他工业生产所需要的物资，促进农业和工业生产的发展。北煤南运的数量减少了，又可以增加北方煤炭的供应量，促进北方工农业生产的发展。可见，积极发展南方煤炭工业的好处是很多的。
    怎样才能迅速发展南方煤炭工业？根据广东省的经验，基本的一条是坚持“两条腿走路”的方针。在建设一定数量的现代化大中型矿井的同时，大办小土群、小洋群煤矿，就能多快好省地发展煤炭工业。在煤炭工业基础比较薄弱的地区发展煤炭工业，要想快，就不能贪大贪洋，就必须抓住“小”和“土”。广东省为什么能快？就是因为1958年大办了煤炭小土群，开了八千多个小煤窑，在这个基础上，经过1959年的改造、提高，幼苗长成小树了，现在，许多小煤窑已向小洋群过渡，有的已向中洋群迈进了。两年来这个省的煤产量突增五倍，说明了小土群、小洋群煤矿具有无穷的生命力。很显然，广东的这个经验也适用于南方其它各省。大办小洋群、小土群煤矿，不仅能快，而且也最适应南方的具体情况，如煤炭地质情况比较复杂、煤炭资源比较分散等等。在这种情况下，采用边勘探，边建设、边生产的方法，就能促进小洋群、小土群煤矿的迅速发展。这些小洋群小土群煤矿经过整顿、巩固和技术改造后，就可能逐步发展为现代化的矿井，为南方煤炭工业布下基点，为煤炭工业在全国范围内的合理布局打下基础。
    南方各省发展煤炭工业，一定要贯彻自力更生、勤俭办企业的方针。这是发展南方煤炭工业的一个最基本的措施。在南方各省发展煤炭工业，是会遇到一些困难的，但是只要下定决心，许多战胜困难的办法就出来了。当然，强调要自力更生，并不是丝毫不用有关部门的支援和协作。由于南方煤田地质情况比较复杂，设备技术条件较差，在可能条件下，需要地质部门大力支援煤田地质的勘探力量，还要机械工业部门支援设备和技术力量。在地区之间也要进行必要的支援和协作。有些一时没有找到煤炭资源的地区，可以同已发现煤炭资源的地区协作，在资金、劳动力、设备、干部等方面进行合理的安排，合建一批小型矿井。这些必要的支援和协作对于加速南方煤炭工业建设都是有很大的促进作用的。
    在南方各省发展煤炭工业，这是一项新的建设事业，当然不是一蹴而成的，因此必须发扬踏踏实实的作风，采取切实可行的措施，解决一个个具体问题。在建设中要分别轻重缓急，集中力量打歼灭战，要采取有计划、有步骤地建设一批、巩固一批、提高一批的办法，使每个煤矿都能迅速地发挥生产能力。发展南方的煤炭工业是大有前途的，只要我们坚决树立起改变南方缺煤的雄心，坚决贯彻两条腿走路的方针，采取切切实实的具体措施，我们就能在短期内迅速增加南方煤炭的产量，现在南方各省已经展开了一个大办煤炭小土群、小洋群的群众运动，这是南方各省工业战线的增产节约运动的一个重要方面，应当积极把这项工作做得又快又好。
