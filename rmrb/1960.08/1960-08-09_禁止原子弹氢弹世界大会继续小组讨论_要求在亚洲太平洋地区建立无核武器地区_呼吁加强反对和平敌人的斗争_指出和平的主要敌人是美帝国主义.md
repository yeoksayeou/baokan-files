Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th Dispatch: The Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament concluded its discussions this evening in forty-six groups.

All group meetings unanimously agreed that people of all countries should strengthen the struggle against the enemies of peace. The vast majority of speakers pointed out that the main enemy of peace is U.S. imperialism. Many strongly condemned U.S. imperialism regarding the incidents of U.S. U-2 and RB-47 spy planes intruding into Soviet airspace and the entry of American missile submarines capable of carrying nuclear warheads into Yokosuka Port, Japan.

Zhao Anbo, deputy head of the Chinese delegation, said at the group meeting this afternoon that the Chinese people fully support the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism.

The group meetings unanimously demanded the immediate withdrawal of U.S. military bases in Japan, the return of Okinawa to Japan by the United States, and the dissolution of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces." The group meetings also expressed full support for the proposal to achieve the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Asia-Pacific region through international concerted action.

The Korean representative suggested at the group meeting that the conference pass a resolution demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Japan. This proposal received widespread support from the group meetings.

At all group meetings, everyone emphasized that peace workers must unite the broad masses of peasants and women and mobilize them to participate in the struggle to defend peace.

The participants in the group meetings unanimously agreed that it is necessary to fight against actions that undermine the peace movement, including opposing the suppression of trade union workers, political party members, and students who actively participate in the anti-"Security Treaty" movement.

A representative from Gunma Prefecture, Japan, said that activists in the peace movement in the county had collected 330,000 signatures in July alone, expressing support for the World Conference and demanding the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch: The Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament held thirteen group meetings today according to different social strata, deeply discussing the issues of people of all strata opposing imperialist aggression and war policies and safeguarding world peace.

The thirteen groups were: workers, peasants and fishermen, youth, women, scholars, jurists, businesspeople, high school students, cultural and artistic figures, religious figures, government civil servants, atomic bomb victims, and propaganda activists.

In the morning, each group meeting featured a central report by a representative introducing their experiences in the struggle for peace, national independence, and democracy. Foreign representatives attending the group meetings also spoke, praising the great achievements of the Japanese people in the struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and calling for strengthening the international united struggle to safeguard peace.

The discussions at the group meetings focused on the results and experiences of the people's struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the past year.

Speakers at the workers' group meeting, attended by about two thousand people, unanimously emphasized the need to link the struggle against nuclear weapons with the struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and emphasized that workers should play a major role in this struggle.

At the peasants' and fishermen's group meeting, representatives emphasized the significance of peasants and fishermen actively participating in mass rallies and demonstrations against the "Security Treaty" in many parts of Japan, and emphasized that youth organizations and women's organizations played an important role in the struggle against the "Security Treaty."

A young teacher from a coal mining city in Hokkaido who attended the youth group meeting said: "After the great struggle against the Security Treaty, the young people in our city are now convinced that they can win their liberation. Young people must stand at the forefront of the united action to free the country from U.S. imperialism."

The originally scheduled college student group meeting did not take place due to police suppression of the students. Police arrested four students gathered at the meeting venue on the pretext of leading demonstrations against Hagerty at Tokyo International Airport. As a result, all the student representatives marched to the police station, demanding the immediate release of the arrested students.

    新华社7日讯　东京消息：第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会今天分成四十六个小组举行的会议，在晚间结束了讨论。
    所有小组会议一致认为，世界各国人民应该加强反对和平敌人的斗争。绝大多数发言者都指出，和平的主要敌人是美帝国主义。许多人就美国U—2型和RB—47型间谍飞机侵入苏联领空的事件以及可以使用核弹头的美国导弹潜水艇驶入日本横须贺港的事件，强烈谴责美帝国主义。
    中国代表团副团长赵安博在今天下午的小组会议上讲话时表示，中国人民完全支持日本人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    各小组会议一致要求立即撤销美国在日本的军事基地，要美国把冲绳归还日本，并且要求解散日本“自卫队”。小组会议还表示完全支持通过国际上的一致行动来争取实现在亚洲和太平洋地区建立无核武器地区的建议。
    朝鲜代表在小组会议上建议大会通过决议，要求美军撤离南朝鲜、台湾、冲绳和日本。这一建议受到各小组会议的普遍支持。
    在所有的小组会议上，大家都强调和平工作者必须团结广大农民和妇女群众，发动他们参加保卫和平的斗争。
    各小组会议的参加者一致认为，必须对破坏和平运动的行动进行斗争，包括反对镇压积极参加反对“安全条约”运动的工会工作者、政党成员和学生等。
    来自日本群马县的代表说，这个县的参加和平运动的积极分子仅仅在7月一个月中就征集到三十三万人签名，表示支持这次世界大会和要求恢复日中邦交。
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会今天按照不同的社会阶层，举行了十三个分组会议，深入地讨论各阶层人民反对帝国主义的侵略和战争政策，维护世界和平的问题。
    这十三个组是：工人、农民和渔民、青年、妇女、学者、法学家、工商业者、高中学生、文化艺术界人士、宗教界人士、政府公务人员、原子弹受害者、宣传活动家。
    上午，在每一个分组会议上都有代表作中心报告，介绍他们在争取和平、民族独立和民主的斗争中所获得的经验。参加分组会议的外国代表也在会上讲了话。他们称赞日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”斗争的巨大成就，并且呼吁加强维护和平的国际性联合斗争。
    分组会议上的讨论集中于人民在过去一年中反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争的结果和经验。
    在大约有两千人参加的工人分组会议上发言的人，一致强调必须把反对核武器的斗争同反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争联系起来，并强调，工人应当在这个斗争中起主要的作用。
    在农民和渔民分组会议上，代表们强调农民和渔民在日本的许多地方积极参加反对“安全条约”的群众大会和示威的意义，并强调，青年组织和妇女组织在反对“安全条约”的斗争中起了重要的作用。
    出席青年分组会议的一位来自北海道的一个煤矿城市的青年教员说：“在伟大的反对安全条约的斗争后，我们城市的年青人现在深信，他们能够争取到他们的解放。青年人必须站在使国家摆脱美帝国主义的统一行动的最前列。”
    原来预定举行的大学生分组会议由于警察对学生采取镇压行动而没有举行。警察以曾在东京国际机场带头举行反对哈格蒂的示威为借口，逮捕了四名聚集在会场的学生。结果，所有的学生代表游行到警察署，要求立即释放被捕学生。
