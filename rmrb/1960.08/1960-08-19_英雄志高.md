    Lofty Aspirations of a Hero
    The Tianjin Knitting Factory is a modern large factory, but its output per machine per shift is lower than that of the smaller Pingyuan Knitting Factory in the same city. This troubled Jin Zhiming, a knitting worker and special-class labor model. He was determined to catch up! Jin Zhiming gathered the workers in his group to study and plan for learning from, catching up with, and surpassing the advanced. Some said, "Our current low output per machine per shift is due to our technical backwardness." Others said, "We are technically backward, but where exactly are we backward?" The discussion became more and more heated, and the study became more and more specific. Finally, Jin Zhiming proposed, "Let's go to the Pingyuan Knitting Factory to learn from their experience." Everyone agreed, and they all went to the Pingyuan Knitting Factory.
    The next day, Jin Zhiming arrived at the factory early. After reporting the advanced experience of the Pingyuan Knitting Factory, such as its fast yarn joining speed, to the Party Committee Secretary, he suggested, "Our factory's low output per machine per shift is due to a lack of skilled operation. Could we organize an amateur technical dissemination university?" The Party Committee Secretary was very supportive. The news of the establishment of the amateur technical dissemination university quickly spread throughout the factory. This was like adding wings to a tiger for the workers' movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass advanced targets, and they were even more motivated. Jin Zhiming not only lectured, but also went deep into the groups to help solve specific operational problems, and taught his skillful "five inspections, one fast" operating method, quickly spreading the seeds of advanced experience among the knitting workers. In just seven days, 95 percent of the workers in the factory surpassed the output per machine per shift of the Pingyuan Knitting Factory, reaching advanced levels.

    英雄志高
    天津针织厂是个现代化的大厂，可是台时产量却比本市一个规模较小的平原针织厂还低，这件事使得针织工、特等劳动模范靳志明心里很不平静。他下定决心要赶上去！靳志明召集小组工人研究学赶超创的规划。有人说：“咱们现在台时产量落后了，就是因为技术落后。”有的说：“我们技术落后，可是落后在什么地方呢？”越讨论越热烈，越研究越具体。最后靳志明提议：“咱们到平原针织厂去学学人家的经验”。大家说走就走，都到平原针织厂去了。
    第二天，靳志明老早就到了工厂，他把平原针织厂接纱速度快等先进经验向党委书记汇报以后，建议说：“咱们厂的台时产量低，就是操作不熟练，能不能组织一个业余技术传播大学？”党委书记一听，非常支持。业余技术传播大学成立的消息很快在全厂传开了。这对工人们开展的学赶超创先进指标运动来说，真如猛虎添翼，劲头更足了。靳志明一方面讲课，一方面深入到小组帮助解决具体操作中存在的问题，并且传授他拿手的“五巡，一快”操作法，很快就把先进经验的种子在针织工人中间撒开了。全厂只用了七天时间，就有百分之九十五的工人超过了平原针织厂的台时产量，达到了先进水平。
