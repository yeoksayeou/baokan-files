    Anhui's Fuyang and Lu'an Special Zones Utilize Every Available Space to Expand Late Autumn Crop Planting

    (Our dispatch) Fuyang Special Zone in Anhui Province is making a concerted effort to rush-plant late autumn crops, striving to expand the late autumn planting area. As of July 27th, the entire special zone had sown 780,000 mu of late sweet potatoes, late corn, mung beans, and buckwheat, accounting for 41% of the plan. Additionally, 530,000 mu of carrots were planted.
    The Party committees at all levels in Fuyang Special Zone attach great importance to the rush-planting of late autumn crops. In the movement to massively plant special late autumn crops, leaders and commune members alike are working hard to plant more high-yield crops. While planting grain crops on a large scale, they are also paying attention to expanding the planting of oil crops and massively planting special carrots. Taihe County proposed a method for each person to plant an additional 1,000 sweet potato seedlings on wasteland, which was praised by the prefectural committee. The 400 members of the Youth and Satellite Rice Reform Professional Teams planted an average of 1,125 sweet potato seedlings each on wasteland in three days. After overfulfilling the task of 2,760 mu of late sweet potatoes in a very short period, the Xiangxilou Production Team mobilized more than 300 people to bring seedlings and fertilizer to replant over 4,000 sweet potato seedlings per mu in the 1,800 mu of early-planted sweet potatoes, achieving full and vigorous seedlings to strive for a bumper harvest of both early and late sweet potatoes. In the rush-planting of late autumn crops, Shihe Commune in Bo County planned to plant another 3,700 mu of peanuts and sesame, but actually completed more than 4,400 mu.
    Fuyang Special Zone is still massively planting late autumn crops. While continuing to advance into blank and abandoned land, all localities are vigorously preparing seeds and fertilizers, planning to plant another season of late autumn crops after harvesting the more than 3 million mu of spring corn, sorghum, and hemp and other early-maturing crops. According to incomplete statistics, all localities have already accumulated 500 dan of fertilizer per mu for these fields.
    Furthermore, according to statistics on July 26th, Lu'an Special Zone in Anhui Province has already sown 295,000 mu of late rice and corn and other grain crops, and planted more than 30,000 mu of carrots. This special zone is now continuing to massively plant late autumn crops and carrots. In order to accelerate the progress of late autumn crop sowing, leading comrades of Party committees at all levels have gone deep into the front line to help grassroots cadres arrange labor and crop rotations, and solve specific problems. Comrade Ma Aimin, Deputy Secretary of the Lu'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Zhang Jianmin, First Secretary of the Huoqiu County Party Committee, personally went to Zhouji Commune in the marginal area of Huoqiu County to help production teams arrange labor. Lujiang County transferred a total of more than 40,000 cadres, workers, and citizens from county-level agencies, enterprises, institutions, factories, and towns to support rush-planting, effectively solving the difficulty of insufficient labor. Comrade Shen Dingsan, Secretary of the Baishan Commune Party Committee of this county, led cadres, veteran farmers, and technicians to various parts of the commune to check the land. Through four checks (checking abandoned ponds, reservoirs, dams, and lake beaches) and seven searches (searching for slopes, vacant land in front of and behind villages, scouring areas, wasteland on ridges, swamps, embankments in dikes, and flower borders in dikes), they found a total of 7,634 mu of vacant land, thus effectively resolving the thinking of some commune members who believed that "expanding the area of late autumn crops is not enough." Actively participating in the rush-planting of late autumn crops, they used vacant land and intercropped various late autumn crops in sesame and peanut fields for more than 4,800 mu in five days.
    Under the specific leadership of Party committees at all levels, all localities in this special zone have also carried out large-scale cooperation based on the principle of equivalent exchange to accelerate the progress of late autumn crop sowing. Huhua Commune in Huoqiu County had land but lacked seedlings, and Zhouji Commune immediately supported 18,000 mu of late sweet potato seedlings. Pengta and Fengcheng brigades of Mengji Commune in this county mobilized 200 commune members and led 250 head of cattle to support rush-planting in Yinxian Brigade, accelerating the daily progress of rush-planting late autumn crops in this brigade from the original 200 mu to more than 400 mu.

    把能种的土地全部种上
    安徽阜阳、六安专区见缝插针扩种晚秋作物
    本报讯　安徽阜阳专区突击抢种晚秋，力争扩大晚秋面积，到7月27日止，全专区已经播种晚山芋、晚玉米和绿豆、荞麦七十八万亩，占计划的41％。同时种了五十三万亩胡萝卜。
    阜阳专区各级党委十分重视晚秋作物的抢种工作。在大种特种晚秋作物的运动中，这个专区从领导干部到社员，都努力多种高产作物，在大种粮食作物的同时，注意扩种油料作物，并且大种特种胡萝卜。太和县提出每人利用荒废地增种一千棵红芋的办法，受到地委的赞扬。青年、卫星两个稻改专业队的四百名队员，三天之中每人平均在废地上扶垅栽插红芋一千一百二十五棵。相西楼生产队在很短期间内，超额完成了两千七百六十亩的晚红芋任务之后，出动了三百多人，带秧带肥把早种的一千八百亩红芋，亩亩补足红芋四千棵以上，达到了苗全苗旺，力争早、晚两季红芋都丰收。亳县十河公社在抢种晚秋作物中，计划再种三千七百亩花生和芝麻，结果完成了四千四百多亩。
    现在阜阳专区仍在大种晚秋作物，各地在继续向空白地荒废地进军的同时，大力备种备肥，打算在三百多万亩春玉米和高粱、麻类等早熟作物收起之后，再种一季晚秋，据不完全统计，各地已经为这些田地每亩积攒了五百担肥料。
    又讯　据7月26日统计，安徽六安专区已经播种晚稻和玉米等粮食作物二十九万五千亩，同时种了三万多亩胡萝卜。现在这个专区正继续大种晚秋和胡萝卜。为了加快晚秋作物播种进度，各级党委负责同志都深入第一线，帮助基层干部安排劳力、茬口，解决具体问题。中共六安地委副书记马爱民同志和霍丘县委第一书记张健民同志，亲自到霍丘县边缘地区的周集公社帮助生产队安排劳动力。庐江县从县直机关、企事业单位、工厂、城镇抽调干部、工人、市民共四万多人，支援抢种，有力地解决了劳动力不足的困难。这个县白山公社党委书记沈鼎三等同志率领干部、老农、技术员分别到全社各地查土地，他们通过四查（查废塘、查水库、查水坝、查湖滩）、七找（找坡侧、找村前屋后隙地、找冲稍、找岭上荒地、找沼泽、找圩内龙垱、找圩内夹花埂），共找出空隙地七千六百三十四亩，从而有力地解决了部分社员认为“扩大晚秋作物面积，土地不够”的思想，积极投入抢种晚秋运动，五天中利用隙地和在芝麻、花生地里套种各种晚秋作物四千八百多亩。
    在各级党委具体领导下，这个专区各地还根据等价交换的原则开展了大协作，互通有无，以加快晚秋作物播种进度。霍丘县户胡公社有地缺种，周集公社立即支援了一万八千亩晚山芋苗。这个县的孟集公社的棚塔和丰城两个大队，出动了二百名社员，牵着二百五十条耕牛到隐贤大队支援抢种，使这个大队抢种晚秋的日进度由原来的二百亩加快到四百多亩。
