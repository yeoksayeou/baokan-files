    The idea of "all trades and industries supporting agriculture" is becoming increasingly popular, and the experience of all trades and industries in supporting agriculture is becoming increasingly rich. The iron and wood factory of the Gu Cheng People's Commune in Jiaoche County, Hebei Province, and the iron, wood, and agricultural tool repair and manufacturing factory of the Jiu Cheng People's Commune in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, which are published in this newspaper today, are good examples of working with farmers on "experimental fields" and organizing employees to regularly participate in agricultural labor.
    How can factories that produce agricultural machinery serve agriculture? Generally speaking, providing agricultural machinery that meets quality standards in a timely manner according to the needs of the agricultural season is considered serving agriculture. However, there is much to be done on how to better serve agriculture. For example, the agricultural machinery needed for agricultural production is diverse. Not only do different agricultural seasons, different crops, and different regions require different machinery, but even within the same agricultural season, the same crop, and the same region, the machinery needed is constantly changing due to the continuous improvement of agricultural production technology. This requires factories producing agricultural machinery not to rigidly produce according to existing drawings and be satisfied with the fact that the products produced have met the factory's quality standards. Instead, they must constantly improve product design according to the needs of local agricultural production, striving for perfection, so that it can play the greatest role in agricultural production.
  Much work must also be done on how to technically help communes skillfully use new agricultural tools. For example, will farmers use the machinery after it is produced? Will farmers repair the machine if it has a minor problem? Will farmers properly store the machine when it is not in use? All of these are matters for the farmers themselves in rural areas, but they are also matters for the factories and enterprises themselves. Every production unit has the task of supporting agriculture, but this support should not only be reflected in agricultural tool production, but also in technical support. Earnestly help them learn the skills of using, repairing, and storing. Only in this way can practical results be truly achieved, and only then can it be said that agriculture is being served well and thoroughly.
    To meet the above requirements, it is not enough to go down a few times a year to investigate, research, and help. We must often go deep into the fields and participate with the farmers in the production links of planting, managing, harvesting, and threshing various crops. Through working together with the farmers, we can specifically and deeply understand whether the products we manufacture are suitable, so that we can start to research and improve them, and manufacture new products that are more suitable for the local climate, soil, geographical environment, and living habits, and better serve agriculture.
    In short, understand deeply and serve well. All work is like this, and supporting agriculture requires it even more.

    了解得深  服务得好
    “各行各业都来支援农业”的思想，越来越深入人心，各行各业支援农业的经验，也越来越丰富。今天本报发表的河北省交河县古城公社铁木厂和山东省高唐县旧城公社铁木农具修造厂，跟农民一起搞“试验田”和组织职工经常参加农业劳动，就是一种很好的做法。
    生产农业机具的工厂怎样为农业服务？就一般情况来说，按照农事季节的需要，及时提供合乎质量标准的农业机具，就算是为农业服务了。但是，怎样才能更好地为农业服务，却大有文章可做。比如，农业生产上需要的机具多种多样，不仅不同的农时季节、不同的农作物、不同的地区所需要的机具各有不同，就是同一农时、同一农作物、同一个地区，由于农业生产技术的不断改进，所需要的农具也是不断变化，这就要求生产农业机具的工厂不能死板地按照已有的图纸进行生产，和满足于生产出来的产品已经达到了出厂的质量标准，而是要根据当地农业生产的需要，不断改进产品设计，精益求精，使它在农业生产上发挥最大的作用。
  在技术上如何帮助公社熟练地使用新的农具，也要做好多工作。比如说，机器生产出来了，农民会不会使用？机器出了点小毛病，农民会不会修理？机器不用了农民会不会保管？所有这些，对农村来说都是农民自己的事，对工厂企业来说，又是工厂企业自己的事。每个生产单位都有支援农业的任务，但是，这种支援不仅表现在农具生产，还应该表现在技术的支援上。切切实实帮助他们学会使用、修理和保管的技能。这样，才能真正收到实际效果，才能说是为农业服务得好，服务到底。
    要达到上述要求，光靠一年下去几次调查调查、研究研究、帮助帮助，是不够的，必须经常深入田间，跟农民一起，参加到各种作物的种植、管理、收割和打轧的生产环节中去，通过和农民共同劳动，具体、深刻地了解自己所制造的产品是否合用，从而着手研究改进，制造出更加切合当地气候、土壤、地理环境生活习惯的新产品，更好地为农业服务。
    总之，了解得深，服务得好。一切工作如此，支援农业尤需如此。
