Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: Representatives attending the second group meeting of the preparatory conference for the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Complete Disarmament held on the 3rd, condemned the imperialist aggression and war policies for endangering the sovereignty of various countries and the lives of the people.

The topic of this group discussion was:

"What consequences do military policies, especially nuclear armament policies, have on the people's living standards? What impact will the prohibition of nuclear weapons, complete disarmament, and peaceful coexistence have on the lives of the people?"

Zhao Puchu, Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation, said at the meeting: The Chinese people and the Chinese government have consistently advocated disarmament. If all countries in the world can genuinely carry out disarmament, it can bring benefits to the people.

Zhao Puchu pointed out that to achieve the goal of disarmament, it is first necessary to fight against US imperialism, which is vigorously expanding its arms race. Because it is none other than US imperialism that has stationed troops and established military bases around the world, stepped up nuclear armament, and recently sabotaged the four-power summit and the ten-nation disarmament conference.

Zhao Puchu pointed out that if US imperialism is not forced to withdraw its troops from Japan and other parts of Asia and dismantle its military bases, if the US-Japan military alliance treaty is not abolished, and if militarism is not eliminated, then there is no way to achieve disarmament in Asia.

Speaking on the issue of disarmament, improving people's lives, and assisting economically backward countries, Zhao Puchu pointed out that only when the colonial and oppressed people achieve national independence, establish independent national industries, and implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can the people's lives be truly improved.

He pointed out that the so-called "aid" of imperialism to economically backward countries is actually a form of capital export, aimed at strengthening its exploitation and control over the recipient countries, seizing the highest profits, and cultivating comprador bourgeoisie to achieve further aggression, and will never bring happiness to the people of the recipient countries.

Japanese representative Makoto Hori pointed out in his speech that with the development of the imperialist arms expansion, the democratic rights of the Japanese people have been suppressed, and the people's living standards have been lowered. Hori Makoto said: "We demand neutrality, no military alliances. We demand a complete ban on nuclear weapons, not the resumption of nuclear tests."

The Korean representative strongly condemned the US imperialists for invading South Korea under the guise of economic "aid," pushing the South Korean people into an abyss of misfortune and suffering. He suggested that the conference pass a resolution firmly demanding that US troops withdraw from southern Korea.

The Vietnamese representative also used concrete facts in his speech to expose the pain brought to the people of South Vietnam by the US imperialist aggression against South Vietnam and its colonial policies. He also called for a resolution in the name of the conference demanding the abolition of US imperialist military bases in various parts of Asia.

After expressing heartfelt support for the speeches of the Chinese representatives, the Indonesian representative accused the members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization of supporting Indonesian counter-revolutionary activities in 1957. He emphasized that the policy of neutrality should be a positive policy against war and imperialism.

The Kenyan representative said that the military bases controlled by imperialist countries are bases for suppressing the national independence movements of African countries.

The West German representative said, "The existence of foreign bases in West Germany means that national sovereignty has been deprived." He condemned the United States, Britain, and France for violating the Potsdam Agreement and demanded that these countries immediately withdraw their troops from foreign countries.

Soviet representative Alexander Mikhailovich Kuklin also spoke at the second group meeting.

    各国代表在第二分组会议上发言
    谴责帝国主义的侵略和战争政策
    赵朴初说：中国人民和中国政府一贯主张裁军。要达到裁军的目的，首先要向大肆扩军备战的美帝国主义进行斗争。如果不迫使美帝国主义从日本和亚洲各地撤走它的军队和撤销它的军事基地、不废除日美军事同盟条约、不消除军国主义，那么就无从实现亚洲的裁军。
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：出席第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会预备会议3日举行的第二分组会议的代表们，在会上谴责帝国主义的侵略和战争政策危害各国的主权和人民的生活。
    这个分组讨论的题目是：
  “军事政策，尤其是核武装政策，对人民生活水平造成什么后果？禁止核武器、彻底裁军和和平共处将给人民的生活带来什么影响？”
    中国代表团副团长赵朴初在会上说：中国人民和中国政府一贯主张裁军。如果世界各国都能真正的进行裁军，是可以给人民带来好处的。
    赵朴初指出，要达到裁军的目的，首先要向大肆扩军备战的美帝国主义进行斗争。因为在世界各地派驻军队，设立军事基地，加紧进行核武装和在不久前破坏了四国首脑会谈和十国裁军会议的，不是别人，正是美帝国主义。
    赵朴初指出，如果不迫使美帝国主义从日本和亚洲各地撤走它的军队和撤销它的军事基地、不废除日美军事同盟条约、不消除军国主义，那么就无从实现亚洲的裁军。
    在谈到裁军和改善人民生活以及援助经济落后国家的问题时，赵朴初指出，只有在殖民地和被压迫的人民获得了民族独立、建立独立的民族工业、实现和平共处五项原则，才能真正改善人民生活。
    他指出，帝国主义对经济落后国家的所谓“援助”，实际上是一种资本输出，是为了加强对受援国家的剥削和控制，攫取最高利润，并且培养买办资产阶级，达到进一步侵略的目的，而绝不会给受援国家的人民带来幸福。
    日本代表堀真琴在发言中指出，随着帝国主义军备扩张的发展，日本人民的民主权利受到压制，人民生活水平降低。堀真琴说：“我们要求中立，不要军事同盟。我们要求全面禁止核武器，而不是恢复核试验。”
    朝鲜代表在发言中强烈谴责美帝国主义者借经济“援助”之名对南朝鲜进行侵略，把南朝鲜人民推进了不幸和苦难的深渊。他建议，大会通过决议坚决要求美国军队撤出朝鲜南部。
    越南代表在发言中也用具体事实揭露了美帝国主义侵略越南南方和它的殖民政策给越南南方人民所带来的痛苦。他并呼吁以大会的名义通过决议，要求取消美帝国主义在亚洲各地的军事基地。
    印度尼西亚代表在发言中表示衷心支持中国代表们的讲话以后，指责东南亚条约组织成员国在1957年支持印度尼西亚反革命活动。他强调指出，中立政策应该是反对战争和帝国主义的积极政策。
    怯尼亚代表说，帝国主义国家所掌握的军事基地是镇压非洲各国民族独立运动的基地。
    西德代表说，“西德存在着外国基地，它意味着国家主权被剥夺了”。他谴责美、英、法三国破坏波茨坦协定，并要求这些国家立即从外国撤出它们的军队。
    苏联代表亚历山大·米哈伊洛维奇·库金也在第二分组会议上讲了话。
