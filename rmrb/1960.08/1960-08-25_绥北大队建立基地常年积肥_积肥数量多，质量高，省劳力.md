    Suibei Brigade Establishes Base for Year-Round Manure Accumulation
    More Manure, Higher Quality, Less Labor
    (Our newspaper, Fuzhou, 23rd) The Suibei Brigade of Chengguan Commune in Zhangpu County, Fujian, has established a fertilizer base and a chemical fertilizer factory, organized a manure accumulation professional team, and extensively mobilized the masses to accumulate manure. They have achieved year-round manure accumulation and planned fertilizer application, resulting in more manure, higher quality, and less labor. This provides valuable experience for solving the fertilizer shortage problem. Recently, the Longxi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site manure accumulation meeting here to comprehensively summarize and promote the experience of the Suibei Brigade.
    In the past two years, with the continuous increase in multiple cropping index and planting area, the Suibei Brigade's fertilizer demand has become increasingly high, leading to new problems such as insufficient fertilizer sources and manure accumulation labor. Last year, the number of workdays spent on manure accumulation accounted for 39% of the total workdays. To solve this contradiction of insufficient labor, the Party branch organized the masses to find the causes and solutions. Everyone believed that manure accumulation according to old habits had two major shortcomings: First, the various stages of manure accumulation, production, management, transportation, and application were not closely linked, and the layout of the fertilizer base was unreasonable. The main bases for manure accumulation, such as cattle pens, pigsties, and manure pits, were all in the villages, while the raw materials for bedding manure accumulation, such as sod and burnt soil, were in the mountains. Therefore, it was necessary to first accumulate manure at home and then transport it to the fields, which wasted a lot of labor. Second, most of the fertilizer relied on temporary, intensive manure accumulation, which was produced and applied hastily, resulting in low quality and high labor costs. In response to these problems, the Party branch summarized the experience of the Dashishan far-farming team in the brigade in establishing a fertilizer base on-site, producing fertilizer on-site, and applying it on-site, and further leveraged the favorable conditions after communization to launch a manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign throughout the brigade: First, a farm fertilizer base was established for every 200 to 500 mu of land. Each base was equipped with cattle pens, pigsties, manure pits, and facilities for planting green manure and accumulating compost, realizing the base production of fertilizer. A total of seven field fertilizer production bases have been established throughout the brigade, accumulating and producing large amounts of human and animal manure on-site, saving a large amount of labor. Second, each brigade planned to establish a chemical fertilizer factory. In the past three months, it has produced 20,000 jin of local arsenic and 40,000 jin of local chemical fertilizer. Third, specialization: 44 commune members were selected and sent to the manure accumulation bases and factories to work as professional team members, engaging in manure accumulation and fertilizer production work for a long time, ensuring that the manure accumulation activities of the bases and factories were uninterrupted. Fourth, regularize manure accumulation work. In addition to the professional team's fixed and regular manure accumulation, the branch also mobilized commune members to accumulate manure regularly, which was purchased by the brigade on a regular basis. In addition, it was also decided to organize several mass campaigns of intensive manure accumulation during the slack season to supplement the inadequacy of the professional team's manure accumulation. In order to ensure the success of the manure accumulation work, the branch also appointed Deputy Secretary Pan Hairui to be in charge of fertilizer work.
    Since the Suibei Brigade strengthened fertilizer work in all aspects, it has gained many benefits, mainly: (1) It has greatly increased the quantity and improved the quality of fertilizer. The 1,500 mu of late rice in the brigade has not only been fully fertilized with base fertilizer, but also accumulated and produced a batch of topdressing fertilizer. This year's fertilizer has been composted and fermented, which greatly improved the fertilizer efficiency compared with the past when it was applied as soon as it was accumulated. (2) It has saved a large amount of manure accumulation labor. In the past, the labor days for manure accumulation and transportation accounted for 39% of the total agricultural labor days. Now, the labor days for manure accumulation and transportation only account for 11% of the total agricultural labor days, saving a lot of labor force, so that the labor force engaged in field production has increased from 312 to 428 people. (3) Because the fertilizer base is close to the fields, it can further accelerate the elimination of remote and low-yielding fields and promote the balanced development of agriculture throughout the brigade.

    绥北大队建立基地常年积肥
    积肥数量多，质量高，省劳力
    本报福州23日电　福建漳浦县城关公社绥北大队建立肥料基地和化肥厂，组织积肥专业队，并广泛发动群众积肥，作到了常年积肥，有计划地用肥，肥料数量多，质量高，又节省了劳力，为解决肥料不足问题创造了经验。最近中共龙溪地委特在这里召开了积肥现场会议，全面总结和推广绥北大队的经验。
    绥北大队两年来随着复种指数和种植面积不断增加，肥料需要量也越来越高，出现了肥源和积肥劳力不足的新问题，全大队去年在积肥方面所用的工数即占总工数的39％。为了解决这劳力不足的矛盾，党支部组织群众找原因和解决问题的办法。大家认为按照老习惯积肥有两大缺点：第一、肥料的积、造、管、运、施各个环节扣得不紧，肥料基地布局不合理。作为积肥的主要基地——牛栏、猪舍、粪坑等都在村里，而垫圈积肥的原料草皮，火烧土却在山上，因此要先往家里积，再往田里送，这样劳力浪费很多。第二、大多数肥料依靠临时突击性积肥，随积随施，粗制滥造，质量不高，花工很大。针对这些问题，党支部总结了这个大队的打石山远耕队就地建立肥料基地，就地积制肥料就地施用的经验，进一步发挥公社化后的有利条件，在全队掀起了积肥造肥运动：第一、每二百亩到五百亩土地建立一个农家肥料基地。每个基地都有牛栏猪舍、肥坑和种绿肥积堆肥的设备，实现了肥料生产基地化。全大队共计已经建立田间肥料生产基地七个，就地大积大制人畜粪肥，节省了大批劳力。第二、各大队有计划地建立化肥厂。三个月来已生产土砒二万斤、土化肥四万斤。第三、专业化：选派社员四十四个，到积肥基地和工厂去当专业队员，长期从事积制肥料工作，保证基地、工厂的积肥活动不间断。第四、积肥工作经常化。除专业队固定经常积肥外，支部还发动社员经常积肥，由大队定期收购。此外还确定在农闲时，一年搞几次全民性的突击积肥活动，弥补专业队积肥的不足。为了保证搞好积肥工作，支部还派副书记潘海瑞专管肥料工作。
    绥北大队从各方面加强肥料工作以后，已经得到许多好处，主要有：（1）大大增加了肥料的数量和提高了肥料的质量。全大队一千五百亩晚稻目前不仅施足了基肥，而且还已积造了一批追肥。今年的肥料都经过沤制、发酵，比过去随积随施大大提高了肥效。（2）节省大批积肥劳力，过去一年积肥运肥劳动日占农业总劳动日的39％，现在积肥运肥劳动日仅占农业总劳动日的11％，节省了大量劳动力，使从事大田生产的劳力由三百一十二人增至四百二十八人。（3）由于肥料基地接近田地，可以进一步加快消灭边远低产田，促进全队农业平衡发展。（附图片）
