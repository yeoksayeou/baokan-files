Xichong Promotes 60,000 Pieces of Field Transport Equipment
Currently Installing Cable Cars and Building Cableways in Mountainous Areas to Reduce Heavy Physical Labor During Autumn Harvest and Planting

(Our dispatch) Sichuan's Xichong County is vigorously promoting the innovation of field transport equipment to save labor in field management. At present, the county has created, imitated, and promoted more than ten kinds of field transport equipment, totaling more than 60,000 pieces. These include more than 50,000 carts, more than 2,600 aerial cableways, more than 2,000 earthen railway tracks, and 5.7 kilometers of iron-wood rails.

This year, the planting area of ​​various crops in Xichong County has expanded compared to last year, the degree of intensive cultivation has increased, and the amount of fertilizer used has increased, resulting in a significant increase in the amount of field transportation. In order to solve this problem, many people actively demanded the reform of field transport equipment, and many workers in the commune-run industry also took the initiative to modify field transport equipment. For example, the workers of Yixing Farm Tool Factory successfully created an automatic fertilizer unloading cart, which can transport more than 500 jin of fertilizer at a time. The workers of the woodworking workshop of Dongfeng Machinery Factory created a hand-pushed rubber-wheeled cart, which is both light and labor-saving to use, and greatly increases the load capacity. The county party committee attached great importance to the enthusiasm of the masses and decided to launch a mass movement based on the principle of innovating with "local methods." The county party committee first mobilized the masses to propose topics and modification methods according to their needs, then concentrated on appraisal and trial production, and then handed them over to factories for mass production and promotion after success. In this way, a new situation has emerged throughout the county where factories are building carts, teams are repairing carts, and everyone is vying to use vehicles. At present, the county's reform focus has shifted to installing cable cars, aerial cableways, and chutes in mountainous areas where there are no roads, in order to completely eliminate manual field transportation during the autumn harvest and planting.

In order to ensure that the tools are actually put to use, the county has renovated more than 4,000 kilometers of existing field transport roads, reduced the slope, leveled the road surface, and newly built some cart roads, basically achieving access to every field.

    西充推广田间运输工具六万件
    目前正在山区安装滑车、架设索道，争取在秋收秋种中减轻繁重体力劳动
    本报讯　四川西充县大搞田间运输工具革新，以节约田间管理的劳力。目前，全县已创造、仿制和推广了各种田间运输工具十多种，共六万多件。其中包括车子五万多部，架空索道二千六百多处，土火车道二千多处，铁木轨道五点七公里。
    今年，西充县各项作物播种面积都比去年扩大，精耕细作程度提高，用肥增多，田间运输量大大增加。为了解决这一问题，许多群众积极要求改革田间运输工具，许多社办工业的工人还主动地改制田间运输工具。例如义兴农具厂工人，创造成功了自动卸肥车，一人一次可运肥五百多斤；东风机械厂木工车间的工人，创造了手推胶轮车，用起来既轻便又省力，载运量大大增加。县委对群众的这种积极性十分重视，决定本着“土法上马”闹革新的方针，大搞群众运动。县委首先发动群众根据需要提出课题和改制的方法，然后集中鉴定、试制，成功后再交工厂大量制造推广。这样，全县普遍出现了厂厂造车、队队修车、人人争用车辆的崭新的局面。目前，全县改革重点已转入在不通车道的山区安滑车、架空索道、梭槽等以便秋收、秋种中彻底消灭田间人力运输。
    为了保证工具切实使用起来，全县对原有的四千多公里田间运输道进行了整修，降低了坡度，平整了路面，并新修了一些车道，基本做到了块块田地通车。
