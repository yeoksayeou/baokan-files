    Learning from Fuxin's Experience in Grasping Transportation in a Down-to-Earth Manner

    Transportation is a crucial link in the current effort to concentrate resources to ensure the sustained leap forward in steel production. Coking, ironmaking, and steelmaking, this series of steel production processes, are all linked by transportation. Can transportation adapt to the current situation on the entire industrial front, centered on steel production, which demands a sustained leap forward? The report in today's newspaper on Fuxin City's organization of five transportation revolutions provides us with an affirmative answer. That is: transportation must adapt to the development of production, and can adapt to the development of production, but not all at once; the process of transportation adapting to production is a process of continuous revolution that involves solving contradictions one by one in a down-to-earth, meticulous, and concrete manner. This experience of Fuxin is very important for all comrades engaged in transportation work, and even for all comrades engaged in economic work, and it is well worth our careful reading and consideration.

    More than a year ago, Fuxin's transportation was still far behind production. In November 1958, Fuxin had as much as 1.5 million tons of coal piled up on the ground, seriously threatening the production of coal mines. This 1.5 million tons of coal educated the cadres of Fuxin, making them realize that to achieve a leap forward in coal production, they must simultaneously achieve a leap forward in railway transportation. As a result, the famous experience of "Twelve Unifications" in road-mine collaboration was created, tapping potential from collaboration and doubling transportation efficiency. From that time on, the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has been grasping coal production with one hand and railway transportation with the other, and has successively organized five transportation revolutions to meet the needs of the high-speed development of coal production. These five transportation revolutions, viewed in isolation, seem very ordinary. The red banner trains organized in the first revolution, the coal storage bins built in the second revolution, the overall renovation of station tracks carried out in the third revolution, the large coal storage bins and automatic loading lines built in the fourth revolution, and the overall renovation of all road-mine lines currently being carried out in the fifth revolution, are all familiar tasks for comrades engaged in transportation work, and there are no strange or mysterious methods. However, why is it that Fuxin has done these tasks and has been able to greatly ease the contradiction between transportation and production, so that transportation can basically meet the needs of production? Is it because Fuxin's production has developed slowly, and the contradiction between transportation and production was not acute in the first place? No. Fuxin is one of China's largest coal bases, and its production has developed very rapidly in recent years. The output in 1958 increased by 80% compared with 1957, the output in 1959 increased by 38.8% compared with 1958, and the production level in the first half of this year has also been rising month by month. The most fundamental reason why Fuxin's transportation work can basically adapt to the sustained leap forward in coal production is that Fuxin's work is done in a down-to-earth manner, so that every transportation revolution can achieve practical results, concretely solve the main contradictions in transportation work in different periods, and raise transportation efficiency to a new level time and time again, so that the leap forward in coal production year after year can be strongly guaranteed. In learning from Fuxin's experience, in addition to learning from Fuxin's business and technical experience in organizing red banner trains and implementing overall renovation, it is more important to learn from the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's down-to-earth work style in grasping transportation.

    Judging from Fuxin's five transportation revolutions, the first characteristic of the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's down-to-earth work style is that it truly achieves going deep into reality. What does it mean to go deep into reality? Generally speaking, going deep into reality means not only seeing the phenomena of things, but also seeing the essence of things and grasping the regularity of the development of things. Marxists have always believed that the actual situation is the basis for determining their actions. In 1948, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his speech at the Jin Sui Cadre Conference: "Determining the work policy according to the actual situation is the most basic work method that all Communist Party members must firmly remember." Whether our work is done in a down-to-earth manner and whether it can achieve practical results depends first of all on whether we are based on reality and whether we have grasped the regularity of the development of things. If we grasp the regularity of the development of things and deploy work according to the actual situation, the work will be down-to-earth and can achieve practical results. Otherwise, we will go in the opposite direction, the subjective will not be consistent with the objective, and there will be no talk of "down-to-earth." Doing work in this way will certainly not achieve practical results.

    The leading cadres of the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have done a good job in this regard. The workers call them "transportation experts," which does not seem to be an overstatement. They go deep into reality and truly grasp the internal connection between transportation and production, as well as the internal connection between various links in transportation work; and this connection is something that some comrades cannot fully understand. Why do some comrades always separate production and transportation, with "those in charge of production not caring about transportation, and those in charge of transportation not caring about production"? One of the fundamental reasons is that these comrades have not thoroughly understood the connection between production and transportation, so transportation has not been done well, and production cannot be done well either. Why do some comrades also grasp transportation work, such as building coal storage bins and organizing red banner trains, but still cannot achieve significant results? One of the fundamental reasons is that these comrades have not thoroughly understood the connection between various links in transportation work, so although some specific work has been done, there is a lack of coordinated action between the front, back, left, and right links, and the problem cannot be fundamentally solved. The comrades in Fuxin do not separate transportation and production, but regard the relationship between transportation and production as a mutually promoting and mutually restricting relationship with production as the main focus, with transportation preceding production and transportation serving production. Based on this understanding, they have determined the policy of grasping production with one hand and transportation with the other. The comrades in Fuxin do not isolate the various links within transportation work, but regard them as an inseparable whole. Based on this understanding, they grab one link after another when grasping transportation, with one revolution following another, grasping both the organizational work of transportation and the technical transformation of transportation, grasping both loading work and operation work. It is precisely because the leading cadres of Fuxin go deep into reality to understand the actual situation that the policies and measures they have determined, and the transportation revolutions they have carried out time and time again, are in line with the actual situation, are down-to-earth, and are derived from the regularity of the development of things, so they can achieve practical results.

    Judging from Fuxin's five transportation revolutions, the second characteristic of the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's down-to-earth work style is to mobilize the masses to work hard and struggle; instead of reaching out for help from above and only waiting for external assistance, this is very important. Whether to mobilize the masses to work hard and struggle, or only wait for external assistance, is a very important sign of whether the work style is down-to-earth. Some comrades engaged in transportation work also have good ideas and perfect plans for changing the situation of transportation lagging behind production; but there is a very significant shortcoming, that is, these ideas and these plans are not based on mobilizing the masses to work hard and struggle, but often rely too much on the hope of waiting for external assistance. Is external assistance necessary? Yes. But for any enterprise, to do a good job in production, the most fundamental thing is to mobilize the masses to work hard and struggle. State assistance and cooperation from brother enterprises cannot replace the mass movement within the enterprise. If we do work mainly by waiting for the state to add equipment and transfer manpower, waiting for the assistance of brother enterprises, instead of mainly relying on the masses, how can this be down-to-earth?

    The five transportation revolutions led by the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party were larger in scale each time than the previous one. Design, construction, investment, equipment, materials, which aspect had no difficulties? If we were only waiting for external assistance, it can be said that none of the revolutions could have been successful. However, the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party resolutely implemented the policy of mobilizing the masses to work hard and struggle, so that these difficulties were solved one by one, and the goals of each revolution could be achieved more quickly. The five automatic loading lines that were determined to be built in the fourth revolution used to take a year and a half to complete, but after the masses were mobilized, they were completed in only seven days, thirty-eight days, and forty days, respectively. From this, we can realize that a very important factor in whether the work is done in a down-to-earth manner is to see whether our plans, policies, and measures have been implemented among the masses, have been mastered by the masses, and have mobilized the masses. The plans, policies, and measures have become the conscious actions of the masses, this is truly down-to-earth, and can achieve practical results.

    Judging from Fuxin's five transportation revolutions, the third characteristic of the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's down-to-earth work style is to grasp tightly from beginning to end. Transportation can be adapted to production, but with the development of production, this state of adaptation is constantly being broken, and needs to reach a new adaptation at a new level. From the internal perspective of transportation work, new contradictions will also emerge after the old contradictions are resolved. This requires us to grasp tightly from beginning to end; instead of stopping after grasping a little and solving some problems. Whether to grasp tightly from beginning to end, or to stop after solving some problems, is also an important sign of whether the work style is down-to-earth. The comrades in Fuxin do not grasp transportation for a while and then let go for a while, intermittently, but grasp tightly and fiercely, and do not let go. In daily work, it is "three grasps a day" (grasping trains, grasping at all times, grasping every shift) and "three grasps a month" (grasping the opening red at the beginning of the month, grasping daily red during normal times, and grasping red to the end at the end of the month to prepare for the next month). The transportation revolution is not over after one revolution, but the content of the second revolution is foreseen during the first revolution, and preparations are made for the second revolution; when the first revolution ends, forces are immediately organized to start the second revolution. It is precisely because of the persistent and down-to-earth work, grasping tightly from beginning to end, that Fuxin's transportation work can continue to leap forward in the continuous resolution of contradictions, so as to continuously adapt to the needs of the sustained leap forward in coal production.

    All of this shows that improving the work style of cadres includes an extremely broad field, which directly or indirectly promotes production in many aspects. Now, after achieving great achievements in implementing the national economic plan in the first half of the year, a new upsurge of a nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy, centered on grain and steel, is about to arrive. The task of the leadership is to foresee the arrival of this upsurge and promote the arrival of this upsurge. All industrial and mining areas must grasp transportation in a down-to-earth manner like the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which is an important link in organizing the nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy. By formulating guidelines and measures based on the actual situation, doing work in a down-to-earth manner, mobilizing the masses to work hard and struggle, and grasping tightly from beginning to end, a new upsurge of the movement to increase production and practice economy will surely appear on China's transportation front!

    学习阜新踏踏实实抓运输的经验
    运输，是当前集中力量保证钢铁生产持续跃进的一个重要环节。炼焦、炼铁、炼钢，这一系列钢铁生产的过程，都是靠运输联结起来的。运输能不能适应当前以钢铁生产为中心的整个工业战线持续跃进的形势要求呢？今天本报发表的阜新市组织五次运输革命的报道，为我们作了肯定的说明。这就是：运输必须适应生产的发展，也可以适应生产的发展，但又不是一下子就能适应的；运输适应生产的过程，是一个踏实地、细致地、具体地解决一个一个矛盾的不断革命的过程。阜新的这个经验，对于一切做运输工作的同志，以至一切做经济工作的同志，都是很重要的，很值得我们仔细地读一读、想一想。
    一年多以前，阜新的运输还是远远落后于生产的。1958年11月，阜新的落地煤就多达一百五十万吨，严重威胁着煤矿的生产。这一百五十万吨落地煤教育了阜新的干部，使他们认识到，要实现煤炭生产的跃进，必须同时实现铁路运输的跃进。结果，创造了著名的“十二统一”路矿协作的经验，从协作中挖掘潜力，使运输效率提高了一倍。从那时开始，中共阜新市委就一手抓煤炭生产，一手抓铁路运输，并且又先后组织了五次运输革命，来适应煤炭生产高速度发展的需要。这五次运输革命，孤立地看，好像都很平常。第一次革命所组织的红旗列车、第二次革命所修建的储煤仓、第三次革命所进行的车站站线总体改造、第四次革命所修建的大型储煤仓和自动装车线，以及正在进行的第五次革命对路矿所有线路进行的全面总体改造，都是做运输工作的同志所熟悉的工作，并没有什么奇特奥妙的方法。但是，为什么阜新做了这些工作，就能在很大程度上缓和了运输和生产的矛盾，使运输能够基本适应生产的需要呢？是阜新的生产发展得很慢，运输和生产的矛盾本来就不尖锐吗？不是的。阜新是我国最大的煤炭基地之一，这几年的生产发展得很快。1958年的产量比1957年增长了80％，1959年的产量又比1958年增长了38.8％，今年上半年的生产水平也是逐月上升的。阜新的运输工作所以能够基本上同煤炭生产的持续跃进相适应，最根本的原因之一，还是阜新的工作做得踏实，因而每一次运输上的革命都能收到实效，切切实实地解决了各个不同时期运输工作中的主要矛盾，一次又一次地把运输效率提高到一个新的水平上来，使煤炭生产年复一年的跃进得到有力的保证。我们学习阜新的经验，除了学习阜新组织红旗列车、实行总体改造等业务上的和技术上的经验之外，更重要的，还是要学习中共阜新市委踏踏实实抓运输的工作作风。
    从阜新的五次运输革命来看，中共阜新市委踏踏实实的工作作风的第一个特点，是真正做到了深入实际。何谓深入实际？概言之，深入实际就是不只是看到事物的现象，而且看到事物的本质，把握住事物发展的规律性。马克思主义者从来认为实际情况是决定自己行动的根据。1948年，毛泽东同志在晋绥干部会议上的讲话中就曾指出：“按照实际情况决定工作方针，这是一切共产党员所必须牢牢记住的最基本的工作方法。”我们的工作做得踏实不踏实，能不能收到实效，首先就看我们是不是立足于实际，是不是掌握了事物发展的规律性。掌握了事物发展的规律性，根据实际情况来部署工作，工作才是踏实的，才能收到实效。否则，南辕北辙，主观同客观不一致，就谈不到“踏实”二字，这样去做工作必不能收到实效。
    中共阜新市委的领导干部在这方面做得很好，工人们称他们为“运输专家”，看来不是一句过誉的话。他们深入实际，真正掌握了运输和生产的内在联系、以及运输工作内部各个环节之间的内在联系；而这种联系，正是有些同志还不能十分理解的。为什么有的同志总是把生产和运输割裂开来，“管生产的不管运输，管运输的不管生产”呢？根本原因之一，就是这些同志还没有透彻地认识生产和运输的联系，因而运输既没有搞好，生产也不能搞好。为什么有的同志也在抓运输工作，例如也在修建储煤仓，也在组织红旗列车，但是还不能收到显著的效果呢？根本原因之一，也是这些同志没有透彻地理解运输工作内部各个环节之间的联系，因而虽然具体工作也做了一些，但是缺乏前后左右各个环节的协同动作，不能根本解决问题。阜新的同志不是把运输和生产割裂开来，而是把运输和生产的关系看作是以生产为主的互相促进、互相制约的关系，生产以运输为先行，运输又是为生产服务的。根据这种认识，他们确定了一手抓生产，一手抓运输的方针。阜新的同志也不是把运输工作内部的各个环节孤立起来，而是把它们看作是一个不可分割的整体。根据这种认识，他们在抓运输的时候，又是一环扣着一环，一个革命接着一个革命，既抓运输的组织工作，又抓运输的技术改造，既抓装车工作，又抓运行工作。正因为阜新的领导干部深入实际了解实际，因而他们所确定的这些方针、措施，所进行的一次又一次的运输革命，都是符合实际的，是踏实的，是从事物发展的规律性中引出来的，因而才能收到实效。
    从阜新的五次运输革命来看，中共阜新市委踏踏实实的工作作风的第二个特点，是发动群众艰苦奋斗；而不是向上伸手，只等外援，这一点很重要。是发动群众艰苦奋斗，还是只等外援，是工作作风是不是踏实的一个很重要的标志。有些做运输工作的同志，对于改变运输落后于生产的面貌也有很好的设想，很完美的计划；但是有一个很重大的缺点，就是这些设想、这些计划，不是建立在发动群众艰苦奋斗的基础上的，而往往过多地建立在等待外援的希望上。外援要不要呢？要的。但是对于任何企业说来，要搞好生产，最根本的，还是要发动群众艰苦奋斗。国家的帮助、兄弟企业的协作，都不能代替企业内部的群众运动。如果我们做工作，主要是等待国家增添设备、调给人力，等待兄弟企业的帮助，而不是主要依靠群众、这怎么能踏实呢？
    中共阜新市委领导的五次运输革命，规模一次比一次大。设计、施工、投资、设备、材料，哪一方面没有困难？如果只是等待外援，可以说，哪一次革命也不能成功。然而，中共阜新市委坚决贯彻了发动群众艰苦奋斗的方针，就使这些困难一一得到解决，而且使每一次革命的目标都能更快地实现。第四次革命确定要修建的五条自动装车线，过去一般需要一年半时间才能完成，后来把群众发动起来，只分别用了七天、三十八天、四十天的时间就完成了。从这里我们可以体会到，工作做得踏实不踏实的一个很重要的因素，就是要看我们的计划、方针、措施，是不是贯彻到群众中去了，被群众所掌握了，把群众发动起来了。计划、方针、措施，变成了群众的自觉行动，这才是真正的踏实了，才能收到实效。
    从阜新的五次运输革命来看，中共阜新市委踏踏实实的工作作风的第三个特点，是自始至终地抓紧。运输是可以同生产相适应的，但是随着生产的发展，这种适应的状况又是不断地被打破，需要在新的水平上达到新的适应。从运输工作内部来看，旧的矛盾解决了，也会出现新的矛盾。这就要求我们自始至终地抓紧；而不是抓了一点，解决了若干问题，就停滞不前了。是自始至终都抓紧，还是解决了若干问题就不抓了，这也是工作作风是不是踏实的一个重要标志。阜新的同志抓运输不是抓一阵放一阵，时断时续，而是紧抓狠抓、抓住不放。在日常工作上是“一日三抓”（列列抓、时时抓、班班抓）、“一月三抓”（月初抓开门红、平时抓日日红、月末抓红到底给下月作准备）。运输革命也不是革一次就完了，而是在第一个革命的过程中就预见到第二个革命的内容，并为第二个革命作好准备；当第一个革命终了时，紧接着就组织力量开始第二个革命。正因为坚持不懈地踏踏实实地去做工作，自始至终都抓紧，阜新的运输工作才能在不断地解决矛盾中不断地跃进，从而不断地适应煤炭生产持续跃进的需要。
    凡此种种，说明改进干部作风包括一个极其广阔的领域，它从许多方面直接或间接地促进着生产。现在，在取得了上半年执行国民经济计划的巨大成就之后，一个新的以粮、钢为中心的全民性的增产节约运动的高潮即将来到。领导的任务就是要预见到这个高潮的来到，促进这个高潮的来到。一切工矿地区都要像中共阜新市委那样踏踏实实地抓运输，这是组织全民性的增产节约运动的一个重要环节。根据实际情况来制定方针和措施，踏踏实实地去做工作，发动群众艰苦奋斗，自始至终都抓紧，在我国运输战线上，必将出现一个新的增产节约运动的高潮！
