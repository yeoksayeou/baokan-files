    Glorious Post, Glorious Person
    ——On High School Graduate Jing Huanyun Participating in Agricultural Production
    Ji Yecheng
    July 26th marked exactly three years since Communist Youth League member Jing Huanyun took her high school diploma to the Guoying People's Commune in the Zhengzhou suburban district to participate in agricultural production. Upon waking up early in the morning, the young woman took out her diary, wanting to write a few sentences in it – what a meaningful day! However, she quickly closed the book and pen again. She needed to go to the experimental field; the early morning dew was the perfect opportunity to spray the cotton plants. As usual, she spent the day in the cotton fields, pruning, removing side shoots, and catching insects, everything progressing very smoothly. It wasn't until dusk that she sat under a kerosene lamp, took out her pen again, opened her diary, and with a happy smile, joyfully recalled her rural life over the past three years, quickly committing these memories to paper.

    In the summer of 1957, Jing Huanyun graduated from high school, preparing to apply to an agricultural school to become an agricultural technician in the future. At that time, our beloved leader Comrade Liu Shaoqi came to Zhengzhou and gave an amiable talk to representatives of graduating students. He said that agriculture was very important, and encouraged everyone to be determined to go to the countryside, to learn from the peasants in a down-to-earth manner, and to be ordinary laborers. Jing Huanyun did not directly hear Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech, but when Secretary Liu Bi of the Municipal Party Committee conveyed Comrade Shaoqi's instructions to them, she jumped up with joy. She wanted to engage in agriculture, to go to the place where the motherland needed her most, to go to the agricultural front right now. She wrote an application to the Party and Youth League organizations at the school, requesting to be among the first to be sent down to the countryside. The leadership warmly supported her request. She immediately packed her bags and went to the countryside.

    A new life began. The next day, the team leader led her to the cotton high-yield field, pointing to Grandpa Fu, who was nearly seventy years old with a flowing white beard, and said: This is your teacher; you will learn cotton management from him in the future. She walked into the cotton field and started learning pruning techniques from Grandpa Fu.

    When she first started picking cotton, Jing Huanyun worked alongside the old women and sisters-in-law. After bending over for a little while, she felt a backache. She wanted to straighten up and take a break, but when she saw that the old women were already ahead of her, she deeply felt that her untrained body was not even as good as an old woman. Once, when sieving manure, some commune members grabbed it with their hands, but she couldn't bring herself to do it. Manure was something she had always considered the dirtiest thing, but the peasants regarded it as a treasure. When she realized the distance between her feelings and those of the peasants, her face turned red. She asked herself: The Party is calling you to labor and train, asking you to learn from the peasants, if the peasants can do it, why can't you? She rolled up her sleeves and threw herself into the work.

    When the prelude to the Great Leap Forward was unveiled, the Guoying People's Commune launched a large-scale water conservancy campaign. Jing Huanyun was moved by the determination shown by the vast number of peasants, their strong will to transform nature, and their soaring enthusiasm. She participated in the battle to build water conservancy projects. Driving a wheelbarrow was very difficult for her, but she was determined to learn. She fell, got up, and continued to learn; she fell again, got up again, and kept learning. After falling three times, she finally found the knack of driving a wheelbarrow, pushing a full load of soil, shuttling back and forth on the construction site. In the twelfth lunar month, water dripped and turned to ice. In previous years, she would have put on a woolen sweater, wrapped a scarf around herself, and sat by the stove. Her mother wouldn't have easily let her go outside. But now, she was standing on the water conservancy construction site, dealing with frozen soil, letting the north wind blow freely through her short hair. When the project reached its final stage, and it was necessary to jump into the already frozen water to dig mud, some people hesitated. Jing Huanyun also hesitated a little, but on the other side of the ground, women's production team leader Li Fengzhi was taking off her shoes and socks, preparing to go into the water. This scene immediately sent a warm current through Jing Huanyun's whole body, making her feel warm all over. She followed Li Fengzhi's example, took off her shoes and socks, jumped into the ice, and used her strength to break the ice layer with her feet, wading through the ice blocks and starting to work. How could the strong young men show weakness in front of this visiting female student? They jumped into the water one after another, launching a labor competition. Jing Huanyun used all her strength and persevered to the end. The gurgling water flowed along the river channel dug by her and others, nourishing the wheat seedlings. Her heart was filled with feelings of happiness and pride.

    She had passed the labor test, and the commune members began to regard her as a member of their commune, no longer calling her "the student from the city." The old people called her "daughter," and the young men called her "elder sister." The Youth League members also elected her as the deputy secretary of the Youth League branch.

    Had the training been successful? No, far from it. Jing Huanyun constantly reminded herself to prevent complacency. One evening, the commune separately held meetings for middle and poor peasants to discuss grain issues, and the Party branch secretary asked her to attend the meeting for prosperous middle peasants. Jing Huanyun enthusiastically walked into the meeting place for prosperous middle peasants. The meeting was cold and quiet, with few people speaking. After a while, the Party branch secretary sent someone to call her to attend the meeting for poor peasants. Before she even entered the meeting place, she could hear lively discussions. Some were recounting the suffering they had endured from unscrupulous grain merchants in the past, while others were praising the policy of unified purchase and sales. An old woman shed tears as she recalled the past. Two meeting places, the same discussion content, why were there two completely different scenes? The Party branch secretary told her: "This is the difference in class! In the future, when looking at problems, you must pay attention to using Chairman Mao's viewpoint of class analysis." The Party branch secretary's words were so brief, but so profound and powerful. From then on, Jing Huanyun more consciously participated in the torrent of class struggle, frequently reflecting to the Party branch the ideological trends of various classes and their reactions to the Party's policies that she heard from labor and life, and also adding her own analysis and understanding.

    In the winter of 1958, when she had participated in agricultural labor for one year and four months, the Party organization accepted her into the Chinese Communist Party. The title of Communist Party member placed higher demands on Jing Huanyun. She worked harder, was more active in her work, and studied more diligently.

    After the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward "developing the national economy must be based on agriculture" as an important guideline for building socialism, and proposed it to the whole Party and the whole nation, Jing Huanyun felt even more like she was on the front line, shouldering heavy responsibilities. Jing Huanyun has already made a request to the commune Party committee, asking to return to the experimental field (she was transferred out of the experimental field last year to work in another team) to continue her cotton scientific experiments. She is determined to create a set of scientific cotton cultivation methods suitable for mechanized farming.

    The people of Guoying Village elected Jing Huanyun as a municipal people's representative to represent them in discussing national affairs. Jing Huanyun has already attended three municipal people's congresses.

    光荣的岗位  光荣的人
    ——记参加农业生产的高中毕业生荆焕云
    姬业成
    7月26日是共青团员荆焕云拿着高中毕业证书到郑州市郊区古荥公社参加农业生产整整三年的日子，清早一起床，姑娘就从抽斗里拿出日记本，想在这上面写上几句，这是多么有意义的一天呀！可是，她很快又把本子和水笔合上了。她要到试验田去，趁早上有露水，正是给棉花打药的好机会。像平常一样，她在棉花地里度过了这一天，整枝、打杈、捉虫，一切都进行得非常顺利。直到黄昏，她才坐在一盏煤油灯下，重新抽出水笔，打开日记本，带着幸福的微笑，愉快地回忆着三年来的农村生活，并且迅速地将这些回忆留在笔下。
    1957年夏季，荆焕云高中毕业了，准备报考农业学校，将来当一个农业技术员。就在这个时候，我们敬爱的领袖刘少奇同志来到了郑州，向应届毕业生代表亲切地讲了一次话。他说农业非常重要，教育大家要下决心到农村去，踏踏实实地向农民学习，当普通劳动者。荆焕云没有直接听到刘少奇同志的讲话，当市委刘必书记把少奇同志的指示向他们作了传达以后，她高兴得跳起来了。她要干农业，要到祖国最需要的地方去，现在就到农业战线上去。她向学校党、团组织写了申请，要求第一批下放到农村。领导上热烈支持她的要求。她就立刻收拾行装到农村去。
    新生活开始了。第二天，队长把她领到棉花丰产地里，指着年已七旬、白须冉冉的傅大爷说：这就是你的老师，以后你就跟他学习管理棉花。她走进棉田，向傅大爷学习整枝技术。
    开始拾掇棉花的时候，荆焕云和老大娘、大嫂子们在一块干。弯着腰干一小会就觉得腰疼，她想直起腰来歇一歇，但看到老大娘都跑到自己前边了，这时候，她深感到自己这没有经过锻炼的身体连个老太太都不如。有一次筛大粪，有些社员用手抓着干，可她自己却伸不出手来。大粪，这是她一直认为最脏的东西，可是，农民却把它当成宝贝。当她发现自己感情上和农民的距离时，脸上就发红了，她反问自己：党是叫你来劳动锻炼的，要你向农民学习，农民能干的你就不能干吗？她卷起了袖子，投入了工作。
    大跃进序幕拉开的时候，古荥公社开展了大兴水利运动。荆焕云被广大农民所表现出来的决心、改造自然的坚强意志和冲天干劲所激动。她参加了建设水利的战斗。驾独轮车，对于她来说是很难的事，可是她决心要学会，翻了扶起来，继续学，又翻了，再扶起来还学。翻过三次以后，她终于找到了驾独轮车的要领，推着满车子土，像穿梭一样来往在工地上。腊月里滴水成冰，要是在往年，她早就穿上毛衣，围上围巾坐在火炉边了，连屋外妈也不会轻易让她去。可是如今她却站在水利工地上，和冻结的泥土打交道，让北风尽情地吹打自己的短发。当工程进行到最后一段，需要跳进已经结了冰的水里挖泥时，有些人迟疑了。荆焕云也有些犹豫，可是在另一边地上，妇女生产队长李凤枝却在脱着鞋袜，准备下水。这情景像一股暖流一样马上通向荆焕云的全身，感到全身热烘烘的。她学着李凤枝的样子，也脱下鞋袜跳进冰里，使力用脚蹬碎冰层，趟着冰块干开了。好强的小伙子们怎能在这位外来的女学生面前示弱呢？他们相继跳下水去，展开了劳动竞赛。荆焕云使出全身的力气，一直坚持到底。淙淙的流水顺着由她参加挖成的河道流向了田野，哺育着麦苗。她内心里充满了幸福自豪的感情。
    劳动关胜利地度过了，社员们开始把她当作自己社的社员了，不再称她是“州里来的学生”。老人们喊她“闺女”，小伙子们称她“大姐”。团员们也选她当了团总支的副书记。
    锻炼已经成功了吗？没有，还差得很远。荆焕云时刻提醒自己，防止自满情绪。一天晚上，社里分别开中贫农会，讨论粮食问题，支书要她去参加富裕中农会。荆焕云满腔热情地走进了富裕中农会的会场，会场上冷冷清清，发言的人寥寥无几。一会儿支书又打发人叫她去参加贫农会，还没走进会场，就听见热烈的讨论声，有的在诉过去受粮食奸商捉弄的苦，有的在称赞统购统销政策好。一个大娘回忆到过去流下了泪来。两个会场，同样的讨论内容，为什么会有两种截然不同的情景呢？党支书告诉她：“这就是阶级的不同啊！往后看问题要注意运用毛主席阶级分析的观点。”党支书的话是那么简短，但又是那么深刻和有力。从这以后，荆焕云就更加自觉地参加到阶级斗争的洪流里去，经常向党支部反映她从劳动、生活中听到的各阶层的思想动向和对党的政策的反应，并且还加上自己的分析认识。
    1958年的冬天，她参加农业劳动一年零四个月的时候，党组织接受她参加了中国共产党。共产党员的称号向荆焕云提出了更高的要求。她劳动更加踏实，工作更加积极，学习更加认真。
    党中央和毛主席把“发展国民经济必须以农业为基础”作为建设社会主义的一个重要的方针，向全党、全民提出来以后，荆焕云更有身临前线，肩负重任的感觉。荆焕云已经向公社党委提出要求，要求重回试验场（从去年起她被调出试验场，到外队工作了），继续进行她的棉花科学试验。她决心要创造出一套适合机械化耕作的棉花科学栽培法。
    古荥村的人们选荆焕云当市人民代表，代表他们讨论国家大事。荆焕云已经出席过三次市人民代表大会了。
