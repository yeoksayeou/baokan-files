Xinhua News Agency, New York: The shadow of a new economic crisis is descending on the United States, causing anxiety among many bourgeois newspapers and economists in the United States. The "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, in its issue of August 8th published in advance, stated that "the mood in the business community is currently anxious" and that "an atmosphere of fear pervades."

What is causing the U.S. ruling clique to be uneasy about the economic situation is the large surplus of production capacity, especially the sharp decline in the production of steel, automobiles, and other industries that are the mainstays of the U.S. economy. After the end of the major steel strike last year, the steel industry's operating rate reached over 90% at the beginning of this year due to inventory replenishment, stimulating U.S. economic activity. However, since then, the trend has been steadily downward. According to the industrial production index released by the U.S. government, January this year was 111 (the average for 1957 being 100), and since then, the monthly production index has not been able to exceed this number, even falling to 110 in May and 109 in June. The "New York Times" said on the 1st that "the cold fact" is that U.S. "industrial production has actually fallen to such an extent that last month (July) production only used one-half of production capacity."

Compared to January this year, the U.S. steel industry has currently reduced production by about 30%, with the officially announced equipment utilization rate being just over 50%. However, according to UPI, "the actual operating rate seems to be even lower than this figure." As for the automotive industry, another important production sector, UPI reported that many manufacturers "are already uneasy about the sales of 1961 model cars because the used car market continues to be weak." It is reported that automobile production has decreased by 12% compared to the beginning of last year.

The employment situation is even more unprecedentedly deteriorated. Even according to the U.S. Department of Labor, the current total number of unemployed in the United States has reached as high as 4.4 million. This figure is more than 2.2 million higher than before the 1957-1958 crisis, accounting for 5.5% of the total labor force. As for the number of part-time unemployed, AFL-CIO President Meany recently pointed out that in the past three years, the number of part-time unemployed has increased by 3.2 million, while the number of people employed in manufacturing, railroads, and mining has decreased by 2 million since Eisenhower took office in 1953.

According to reports, U.S. corporate inventories have recently reached $93 billion, exceeding the highest level before the start of the 1957 crisis.

The instability of the economic situation has caused a major drop in the Wall Street stock market recently. The "New York Herald Tribune" published a report on the 2nd stating that "Wall Street is frowning today because the volume of stock trading has fallen to its lowest level in ten months. Almost all major stocks have generally declined because there is no favorable business news." The newspaper said that due to the decline in the prices of heavy industry stocks and other major stocks, the Dow-Jones industrial average fell 4.17 points in one day, dropping to 613.68, while it had reached nearly 650 in early July.

Many people in the United States now believe that a new economic crisis is approaching the United States. University of Michigan economist Haber believes that a "recession" (a euphemism for crisis used by the U.S. bourgeoisie) is currently "obviously brewing." The university also conducted a public opinion survey on this issue, and the result of the survey was that "60% of the people surveyed believe that another economic recession similar to 1958 (crisis) is approaching. 16% of the people believe that the recession has already begun."

Faced with the increasingly approaching economic crisis, the U.S. ruling clique is currently trying to stimulate business activity by intensifying the "Cold War" and creating tense situations to increase military spending. According to the "New York Herald Tribune," the U.S. government recently announced that it has awarded Douglas Aircraft Company a $600 million contract to manufacture new missile aircraft. The U.S. Congress has already appropriated more than $600 million for military activities. At the same time, the presidential candidates of both U.S. parties are trying their best to clamor for further increases in military spending. Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy openly advocated increasing military spending by $2.5 billion to $3 billion to "avoid" what he believes will be an "economic recession" this winter. Republican presidential candidate Nixon is also vigorously advocating stepping up arms expansion and war preparation.

    工业生产下降　失业人数增加　股票价格下跌
    新的经济危机正在降临美国
    统治集团力图加剧冷战增拨军费刺激企业活动
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：一次新的经济危机的阴影正在降临美国，这引起了美国许多资产阶级报刊和经济学家的忧虑。提前出版的8月8日一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志说美国“企业界目前的情绪是忧心忡忡”，“气氛弥漫着恐惧”。
    引起美国统治集团对经济情况不安的是生产能力的大量过剩，特别是作为美国经济主要支柱的钢铁、汽车等工业生产的急剧下降。在去年的钢铁大罢工结束之后，今年初由于补进存货曾使钢铁工业开工率高达90％以上，引起美国经济的活跃。但是，自从那时以来，趋势却是每况愈下。据美国官方发表的工业生产指数，今年1月是一百一十一（1957年的平均数为一百），自此以后每月的生产指数都没有能够超过这个数字，5月份甚至还下降到一百一十，6月份又下降到一百零九。“纽约时报”1日说，“冷酷的事实”是：美国的“工业生产实际上已经下降到这种程度，以至上个月（7月份）的生产只使用了生产能力的二分之一”。
    同今年1月相比，目前美国钢铁工业已减产30％左右，官方宣布的设备利用率为50％多。但据合众国际社认为，“实际开工率似乎比这个数字还要低一些”。至于另一个重要生产部门汽车业方面，据合众国际社说，许多制造商“已经对1961年式汽车的销售情况感到不安，因为旧汽车市场继续疲软”。据报道，汽车生产已比去年初下降12％。
    就业情况更是空前恶化。即使据美国劳工部宣布，目前美国的全失业人数已高达四百四十多万。这个数字比1957—1958年危机前多二百多万，占劳动力总数的5.5％。至于半失业的人数，“劳联—产联”主席米尼最近指出，在最近三年来，半失业人数增加了三百二十万，而制造业、铁路业和采矿业的就业人数自从艾森豪威尔在1953年上台以来却减少了二百万。
    据报道，美国企业的存货最近已经达到九百三十亿美元，超过了1957年危机开始前的最高水平。
    经济情况的不稳引起华尔街股票市场最近的大跌。“纽约先驱论坛报”刊载一篇2日的报道说，“今天华尔街愁眉苦脸，因为股票成交额跌到了十个月来最低的水平。几乎所有的主要股票都普遍下降，因为没有什么有利的企业消息。”这家报纸说，由于重工业股票和其他主要股票价格的下降，道—琼斯工业股指数一天就下降四点一七，跌到六一三点六八，而7月初曾经达到将近六百五十。
    现在美国许多人都认为，一次新的经济危机正在逼近美国。密执安大学的经济学家哈伯认为，“衰退”（美国资产阶级为危机取的代名词）目前“显然在酝酿中”。这家大学还就这个问题进行了一次民意调查，调查的结果是，“60％被调查的人认为另一次类似1958年（危机）的经济衰退正在逼近。16％的人认为，衰退已经开始。”
    面临日益逼近的经济危机，美国统治集团目前正力图通过加剧“冷战”和制造紧张局势以增加军事开支的办法来刺激企业活动。据“纽约先驱论坛报”报道，美国政府最近已经宣布给予道格拉斯飞机公司六亿美元的合同来制造新的导弹飞机。美国国会已经增拨六亿多美元来从事军事活动。同时，美国两党的总统候选人还竭力叫嚷要进一步增加军费。民主党总统候选人肯尼迪就公开鼓吹增加军费二十五亿到三十亿美元以“避免”他认为将在今年冬季发生的“经济衰退”。共和党总统候选人尼克松也大力鼓吹要加紧扩军备战。
