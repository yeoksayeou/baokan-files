    Fifteen Years of Struggle by the Korean People to Create a New Life
    Park Kim-chul, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party
    It has been fifteen years since the Korean people, relying on the great Soviet army, were liberated from the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism.

    The "August 15th" Liberation opened a new era in the history of the Korean people. From then on, our people firmly grasped sovereignty in their own hands and, under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist Party, embarked on the road of creating a happy new life.

    In the past fifteen years, tremendous revolutionary changes have taken place in all aspects of our country, including politics, economy, and culture, and the face of the country has been completely renewed.

    The roots of exploitation of man by man have been permanently eliminated in the northern half of our country. Our country, which was a backward agricultural nation in the past, has now been transformed into a socialist industrial-agricultural nation with an independent economic foundation.

    All the people have finally freed themselves from poverty, ignorance, and suffering in life, and are happily celebrating a free and happy new socialist life.

    Before liberation, Korea was a backward colonial, semi-feudal society. Under the occupation of Japanese imperialism, Korean industry could only produce raw materials and semi-finished products; agriculture was also very backward. When Japanese imperialism was defeated, it destroyed even this deformed and backward industry.

    Because American imperialism occupied South Korea, the country was divided into two parts, separating the industrial region of the north from the agricultural region of the south, further exacerbating the imbalance of the national economy.

    Thanks to the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the selfless struggle of all the liberated working people of our country, our people's economy has been rapidly restored and developed, and the northern half of the Republic has become a powerful democratic base. However, our people's peaceful construction was interrupted by the aggressive war launched by American imperialism.

    The three-year Fatherland Liberation War against American imperialism and its lackeys was the most severe test for our people.

    Our people, united as one around the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, crushed the enemy's armed attacks and gloriously defended the freedom and independence of their motherland.

    During our most difficult period, the Chinese people, holding high the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, sent the Chinese People's Volunteers to assist the Korean people with their blood.

    The victory we achieved in the Korean War clearly proves that the power of the people who have mastered their sovereignty is infinite, and no force can conquer the people united under the banner of proletarian internationalism.

    The three-year war brutally destroyed our people's economy. Almost all factories, enterprises, and educational and cultural institutions were reduced to ruins, and even the foundations of the people's lives were severely damaged. Therefore, we had to restore the destroyed industry and agriculture, lay the foundation for industrialization, and rapidly improve the living standards of the impoverished people.

    Our Party, based on the direct proposal of Comrade Kim Il-sung, formulated the basic line of economic construction regarding prioritizing the development of heavy industry while simultaneously developing light industry and agriculture.

    We encountered many difficulties, with severe shortages of equipment and funds, labor and technology, and the problem of the working people's food, clothing, and housing was also very pressing. However, our Party relied on the indomitable fighting spirit of our people, tempered by the arduous war, and their inexhaustible creative spirit, to organize and mobilize the entire working masses to participate in the arduous struggle of post-war recovery and construction.

    Inspired by the correct leadership of our Party and the great assistance of the people of fraternal countries, our people bravely overcame all difficulties and victoriously completed the arduous task of recovery and construction in a short period after the war.

    From 1956, our country's industrial production increased to 1.8 times that of 1949 before the war, and agricultural production also greatly exceeded the pre-war level.

    While our people were continuing to carry out the arduous struggle of recovery and construction, international reactionary forces and their lackeys, the modern revisionists, frantically stirred up "anti-Soviet and anti-Communist" disturbances; American imperialism and its lackeys, who occupied South Korea, frantically plotted a march north.

    However, our Party has always adhered to Marxist-Leninist principles in any difficult environment, united the entire working masses more closely around itself, and led this united force in the labor struggle of socialist construction.

    From 1957, our Party organized and mobilized the entire working masses to implement the ambitious First Five-Year Plan, thereby laying the foundation for our country's industrialization and basically solving the people's food, clothing, and housing problems.

    In order to tap all production potentials and maximize the patriotic enthusiasm of the working masses, our Party went deep into the masses, solved the masses' numerous difficulties, directly discussed ways to overcome difficulties with the masses, integrated with them, and launched a nationwide movement to increase production and practice strict economy. Our lives were already very hard, and we encountered the destruction of war, so everything was lacking, and our lives lagged behind others. Therefore, in order to live a life no less than others, we must continue to run forward.

    The working masses correctly recognized the Party's policies, and their revolutionary enthusiasm was very high, setting off an unprecedented high tide in all sectors of socialist construction.

    Our people completed the First Five-Year Plan two and a half years ahead of schedule; from 1957 to 1959, an average annual growth rate of 45% was guaranteed in industrial production.

    The total value of industrial output in 1959 increased to 6.6 times that of 1944 before liberation and 6.1 times that of 1949 before the war.

    Our industry has already developed a series of new sectors and built new bases, and the colonial deformity has been completely eliminated.

    Fundamental changes have also taken place in the technical equipment and sectoral structure of industry. The machinery manufacturing industry, which was almost non-existent during the period of Japanese imperialist rule, has developed rapidly. In 1959, the proportion of the machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries in our country's industrial production increased from 1.6% in 1944 before liberation to 20.6%. During the period of Japanese imperialist rule, our country's machinery manufacturing industry could not even produce decent machine parts, but today it can produce various large-scale mechanical equipment such as trucks and tractors, and can basically solve the domestic needs for mechanical equipment on its own.

    Light industrial sectors such as the textile industry, which were very backward in the past, have also achieved rapid development. Calculated on a per capita basis, our country's textile production can reach more than 30 meters per year within a few years.

    In order to rapidly increase the production of consumer goods for the people, a policy of simultaneously developing large-scale central industries and small and medium-sized local industries has been formulated. In this way, we do not use huge amounts of national funds, but only tap local potential, ensuring the rapid development of local industries.

    Today, the industrial sector in our country is carrying out technical renovations more extensively. This technical renovation is further promoting the speed of industrialization.

    Over the past period, historically significant changes have also taken place in our agricultural economic sector.

    Thanks to the correct agricultural policy of the Korean Workers' Party and the high political enthusiasm of the peasant masses, we successfully completed one of the most arduous revolutionary tasks of the transition period—agricultural collectivization—within four to five years, and simultaneously with the completion of agricultural collectivization, we also victoriously carried out the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises.

    Relying on the superiority of the socialist cooperative economy, our agriculture is rapidly developing agricultural productivity and has also achieved tremendous success in the technical transformation of agriculture. Agricultural water conservancy, to overcome natural disasters, has been basically completed. Agricultural electrification is also proceeding rapidly. As a result, 90% of the rural areas currently have electricity.

    Agricultural mechanization is rapidly being realized, and many tractors and automobiles are already operating in rural areas.

    Over the fifteen years since liberation, the cause of cultural revolution has also achieved epoch-making achievements.

    Our national culture, which was ravaged by the colonial obscurantist policy pursued by Japanese imperialism in the past, is now flourishing brilliantly.

    The number of schools at all levels in our country has increased to 5.5 times that before liberation. There was not even one university during the period of Japanese rule, but now there are thirty-seven.

    Our country has implemented a seven-year compulsory education system since 1958, and is currently effectively carrying out preparations to ensure the technical compulsory education system that will be implemented from 1962. Currently, the number of students receiving free education at all levels of schools accounts for one-quarter of our country's population.

    All villages (administrative units) in our country have medical institutions, and a universal free medical system has been implemented.

    Today, the prospects for our people are even more brilliant. From 1961, the Korean people will implement a new Seven-Year Plan for developing the people's economy, which is of decisive significance in the country's socialist industrialization.

    In the future, our country's socialist economic foundation will be consolidated more rapidly, and the material and cultural living standards of the people will also be significantly improved.

    All the achievements that our people have made in socialist construction are a solid material guarantee for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    For fifteen years, the occupation of South Korea by American imperialism and their colonial plunder policy have prevented the South Korean people from escaping hunger, poverty, and a lack of rights.

    American imperialists have completely subordinated the South Korean economy to them and cruelly destroyed the South Korean national economy. Currently, South Korea's industrial production has decreased to half of what it was during the period of Japanese rule, grain production has decreased by 40%, and millions of unemployed people and grain-deprived farmers are wandering on the brink of starvation.

    American imperialism and its lackeys cruelly suppress the South Korean people who demand freedom, democracy, and the right to life, and use knives and guns to maintain their colonial fascist reign of terror.

    However, the South Korean people, regardless of the enemy's suppression, bravely rose up and overthrew Syngman Rhee, a faithful lackey of American imperialism, giving American imperialism and its lackeys a heavy blow. The cunning mask of American imperialism and the truth of its aggression have become even more apparent to the world.

    On the one hand, American imperialism bloodily suppresses the South Korean people's struggle, and on the other hand, it frantically instigates its lackeys to create various conspiracies such as "elections" to deceive the South Korean people.

    However, the South Korean people are becoming increasingly aware, and their struggle for a new politics and a new system is also becoming increasingly fierce.

    Our Party has consistently adhered to the line of peaceful reunification and has made every effort to achieve it. Today, the only way to guarantee the true freedom and democracy of the South Korean people and fundamentally improve the living conditions of our South Korean compatriots is to force American imperialism to withdraw from South Korea, achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and rely on the strong economic strength of the northern half of Korea to rapidly restore the destroyed South Korean national economy. Our Party's line of peaceful reunification has received enthusiastic support from the broad masses of working people in South Korea. All the Korean people must unite their strength, force American imperialism to withdraw from our country's territory, and achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The just struggle of our people to carry out the country's socialist construction and peacefully reunify the motherland has received the absolute support and solidarity of the people of all countries in the socialist camp and peace-loving people around the world. The people of socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have provided tremendous fraternal assistance, both materially and spiritually, to our people during the arduous war period and the post-war recovery and construction period. The Chinese people not only assisted our people with their blood during the war, but also continued to provide great assistance to our people after the war, which has become a huge force in our people's socialist construction. The solid friendship and solidarity with the people of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is a strong guarantee for all the victories of our people.

    Our people will continue to hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, do everything possible to strengthen the unity and solidarity with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and will forever advance together with the Chinese people in the struggle for peace and socialism.

    朝鲜人民为创造新生活而斗争的十五年
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长　朴金喆
    朝鲜人民依靠伟大的苏联军队摆脱日本帝国主义殖民统治，获得解放已经有十五年了。
    “八·一五”解放，在朝鲜人民的历史上开辟了新的时代。从此，我们人民把主权紧紧地掌握在自己的手里，在马克思列宁主义党的领导下，开始走向了创造幸福的新生活的道路。
    过去十五年，我国的政治、经济、文化等一切方面都有了巨大的革命的变革，国家的面貌焕然一新。
    我国北半部永远消除了人剥削人的根源。我国过去是落后的农业国家，而现在已经转变成具有自主经济基础的社会主义工业—农业国家。
    所有的人们最后地摆脱贫穷、无知和生活上的痛苦，获得了解放，欢度着自由幸福的社会主义新生活。
    解放前，朝鲜是落后的殖民地、半封建社会。在日本帝国主义的强占下，朝鲜的工业只能生产原料和半制品；农业也很落后。日本帝国主义在它被击溃的时候，连这种畸形性的、落后的工业也都给破坏了。
    由于美帝国主义霸占了南朝鲜，国土被分裂成两部，使北半部工业地区和南半部农业地区分隔起来，使国家经济的不平衡性更加严重了。
    由于朝鲜劳动党的正确领导，和解放了的我国全体劳动人民的忘我斗争，我们的人民经济飞快地得到了恢复和发展，共和国北半部变成了强大的民主基地。但是，由于美帝国主义发动的侵略战争，我们人民的和平建设就被中断了。
    三年的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的祖国解放战争，是对我国人民的最严峻的考验。
    我们人民钢铁般地团结在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府周围，粉碎了敌人的武装进攻，光荣地保卫了自己祖国的自由和独立。
    中国人民在我们最艰苦的时期，高举抗美援朝的旗帜，派遣人民志愿军，以鲜血援助了朝鲜人民。
    我们在朝鲜战争中取得的胜利，明显地证明掌握了主权的人民的力量是无穷的，任何力量也不可能征服团结在无产阶级国际主义旗帜下的人民。
    三年的战争，残酷地破坏了我国的人民经济。几乎所有的工厂、企业和教育文化机关都变成了废墟，连人民的生活基础也都遭到了严重的破坏。因此，我们要恢复遭到破坏的工业和农业，奠定工业化的基础，并要迅速地提高贫困的人民生活水平。
    我们党根据金日成同志的直接建议，制订了关于优先发展重工业、同时发展轻工业和农业的经济建设基本路线。
    我们曾经遇到过许多困难，器材和资金、劳动力和技术非常缺乏，劳动人民的衣食住问题也十分紧张。但是，我们党依靠通过艰苦的战争久经锻炼的我国人民不屈不挠的斗志和他们的无穷尽的创造精神，组织和动员全体劳动群众参加了战后恢复建设的艰巨斗争。
    我国人民为我们党的正确领导和兄弟国家人民的莫大援助所鼓舞，勇敢地克服所有的困难，在战后短短的时间胜利地完成了恢复建设的艰巨任务。
    1956年起，我国工业生产比战前1949年增加到一点八倍，农业生产也大大地超过了战前水平。
    我国人民正在继续展开恢复建设的艰苦斗争时期，国际反动势力和它的走狗现代修正主义者们疯狂地掀起了“反苏反共”骚动；霸占着南朝鲜的美帝国主义及其走狗们疯狂地策划了北进。
    但是我们党在任何艰苦的环境下，也一向坚持马克思列宁主义原则，把全体劳动群众更紧紧地团结在自己的周围，领导这个团结起来的力量进行了社会主义建设的劳动斗争。
    从1957年起，我党就组织和动员全体劳动群众执行了庞大的第一个五年计划，从而奠定我国的工业化基础、基本上解决了人民的衣食住问题。
    我们党为了挖掘所有的生产潜力和最大限度地发扬劳动群众的爱国热情，深入群众，替群众解决重重的困难，直接和群众讨论了克服困难的办法，和他们打成一片，展开了为争取增产、厉行节约的全民性运动。我们的生活原来就很苦，又遇到战争的破坏，因而一切都很缺乏，生活比人落后，所以为了过不次于他人的生活，就要继续跑步前进。
    劳动群众正确地认识了党的政策，他们的革命热情非常高昂，在社会主义建设的所有部门中掀起了空前的大高潮。
    我国人民提前两年半完成了第一个五年计划；从1957年到1959年间，在工业生产中，每年都保障了平均45％的增长速度。
    1959年的工业总产值增加到解放前1944年的六点六倍，战前1949年的六点一倍。
    我国工业已经有了一系列新的部门，还建成了新的基地，也已经完全消除了殖民地畸形状态。
    工业的技术装备和部门结构上也发生了根本的变化。日本帝国主义统治时期几乎没有的机械制造业，得到了迅速的发展。1959年的我国工业生产中，机械制造业和金属加工业的比重，从解放前1944年的1.6％增长到20.6％。日本帝国主义统治时期，我国的机械制造业连像样的机器零件都没有做得出来，而今天已经能生产载重汽车、拖拉机等各种大型机械设备，并基本上能够自己解决国内机械设备的需要。
    过去很落后的纺织工业等轻工业部门，也有了飞跃的发展。按人口计算，我国织品产量，几年以内每年能达到三十米以上。
    为了迅速地增加人民消费品的产量，制定了大规模的中央工业和中小规模的地方工业并举的方针。这样，我们不用国家的巨额资金，只挖掘地方的潜力，保证了地方工业的迅速发展。
    今天，我国工业部门，更加广泛地进行技术改建。这个技术改建正在进一步地促进工业化的速度。
    过去期间，我国农业经济部门也发生了具有历史意义的变化。
    由于朝鲜劳动党正确的农业政策和农民群众高昂的政治热情，我们在四—五年之内顺利地完成过渡时期最艰巨的革命任务之一——农业合作化，和完成农业合作化的同时，也胜利地进行了私营工商业的社会主义改造。
    我国农业依靠社会主义合作经济的优越性，正在很快地发展农业生产力，并在农业的技术改造中也取得了巨大的成就。为了克服自然灾害的农业水利化，基本上已经完成。农业电气化也在很快地进行。结果，目前有90％的农村，都有了电。
    农业机械化迅速得到实现，已经有许多拖拉机和汽车在农村进行作业。
    解放后十五年来，文化革命事业也取得了划时代的成就。
    过去，由于日本帝国主义推行殖民地愚昧政策遭到了蹂躏的我们民族文化正在灿烂的开花结果。
    我国的各级学校，比解放前增长到五点五倍。日寇统治时期连一所的大学都没有，而现在已经有了三十七所。
    我国从1958年起实行了七年义务教育制，目前又有效地进行着为了保障将从1962年起实行的技术义务教育制的准备工作。目前在各级学校受到免费教育的学生人数有我国人口的四分之一。
    我国的所有里（行政单位）都设有医疗机关，普遍实行了免费医疗制。
    今天，我国人民的前景更加辉煌。朝鲜人民将从1961年起执行在国家社会主义工业化方面有着决定意义的新的发展人民经济的七年计划。
    今后，我国的社会主义经济基础将更加迅速地得到巩固，人民的物质文化生活水平也将显著地得到提高。
    我国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的一切成就是和平统一祖国的牢固的物质保证。
    十五年来，美帝国主义对南朝鲜的霸占和它们的殖民掠夺政策，使南朝鲜人民还没有能摆脱饥饿、贫穷和无权利的境地。
    美帝国主义者把南朝鲜经济彻底地隶属于他们，残酷地破坏了南朝鲜民族经济。目前，南朝鲜的工业生产减少到日寇统治时期的一半，谷物生产减少了40％，几百万失业者和断粮农民彷徨在饥饿线上。
    美帝国主义及其走狗残酷地镇压要求自由、民主和生活权利的南朝鲜人民，用刀枪维持其殖民地法西斯恐怖统治机构。
    但是南朝鲜人民不顾敌人的镇压，英勇奋起打倒了美帝国主义的忠实走狗——李承晚，给予了美帝国主义及其走狗以沉重的打击。狡猾的美帝国主义的假面目和它的侵略真相更加大白于天下。
    美帝国主义，一方面血腥镇压南朝鲜人民的斗争，另一方面疯狂唆使它的走狗制造“选举”等各种阴谋，欺骗南朝鲜人民。
    但是，南朝鲜人民的觉悟愈来愈高，他们要求新政治、新制度的斗争也愈来愈剧烈。
    我们党一贯坚持和平统一的路线，并为其实现竭尽了一切努力。今天，保证南朝鲜人民的真正自由和民主，根本改善南朝鲜同胞的生活处境的唯一途径是：要迫使美帝国主义撤出南朝鲜，实现祖国的和平统一，依靠朝鲜北半部强有力的经济力量迅速恢复被破坏的南朝鲜民族经济。我们党的和平统一路线受到南朝鲜广大劳动群众的热烈支持。全朝鲜人民一定把力量联合起来，迫使美帝国主义撤出我国国土，实现祖国的和平统一。我国人民进行的国家的社会主义建设和和平统一祖国的正义斗争，受到全世界社会主义阵营各国人民和爱好和平人民的绝对支持和声援。苏联和中华人民共和国等社会主义各国人民，在我国人民进行艰苦战争的时期和战后恢复建设时期，给予了物质和精神上的莫大的兄弟援助。中国人民在战争时期，不仅以鲜血援助了我国人民，战后也对我国人民继续给予莫大的援助，这在我国人民的社会主义建设中成为巨大力量。同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民的牢固的友谊团结，是我们人民一切胜利的坚强的保证。
    我国人民将继续高举马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义旗帜，为加强同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的统一团结而竭尽一切努力，并在为和平与社会主义的斗争中，将永远同中国人民一起前进。
