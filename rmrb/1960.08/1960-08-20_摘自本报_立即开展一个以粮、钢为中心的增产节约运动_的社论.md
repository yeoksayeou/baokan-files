All factories, mines, communes, organizations, schools, and military units must strive to improve production efficiency and work efficiency, save living labor, and save grain, cotton cloth, steel, and coal. They must cherish machinery and tools and save all materials that can be saved. We must not only build the country diligently and frugally, run factories diligently and frugally, and run communes diligently and frugally, but also manage households diligently and frugally and run all undertakings diligently and frugally. We must, through this movement, further cultivate a social atmosphere among the people of the whole country that takes hard work and plain living as an honor and extravagance and waste as a shame.
