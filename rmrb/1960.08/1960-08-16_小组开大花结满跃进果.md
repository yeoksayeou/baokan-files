    Small Groups Blossom, Bearing Bumper Harvests of Leaps Forward
    Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory Communications Group

    Grasp ideology, production, and life all together,
    Everywhere blooms a full leap forward flower;
    Every task, a seed is sown,
    Returning to the group, bearing great melons grown.

The above doggerel is the sentiment of the vast workers and cadres of the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory. Since this factory began to focus on small group work in May of this year, many groups have experienced a full leap forward. Advanced groups have become even more advanced, and backward groups have also caught up. On the banks of the Huangpu River, hundreds of red flags of full leap forward groups have been raised. We visited the Wu Xiankang and Jin Tianshou groups, and here we will introduce some of the situations of these two groups.

    Chairman Mao's Works Point the Way

These groups all take studying Chairman Mao's works as one of the main contents of group life. Mao Zedong Thought has given them immeasurable strength and wisdom, promoting their production. The Jin Tianshou group of the Valve Workshop is a good example.

This group originally had twenty-six people. With the deepening development of the technological revolution, it was adjusted during the factory's reorganization of labor. Only sixteen people remained in the whole group, with an average technical grade of less than level three. In May of this year, which was the first month after the organizational adjustment, the group's tasks increased more than twofold. In the past, they only did galvanizing and etching work in ship repairs. Now, the galvanizing and etching work on the shipbuilding line has also been merged into this group. At the same time, they also had to complete a technical innovation project for a galvanizing production line in this month. At that time, some people in the group reflected: "The manpower has been reduced by one-third, the task has increased by more than two times, and we have to overfulfill the production plan and also carry out the production line. If we don't do it well, we will lose on both sides, which is terrible!" Some people also said: "This month is a production task of one person equaling three and a half people. Where is the strength to carry out the production line? It is safer to take care of one head!" Others said: "To build a galvanizing production line, 370 meters of acid-resistant cement floor must be laid. We don't understand cement pouring technology, so let's wait for the capital construction department to do it!" In the end, it was said that production and innovation could not be taken care of at the same time.

Group leader Jin Tianshou is a Communist Party member. He has never wavered. After researching with the core team, he reported the group's situation to the Party branch in detail. The branch secretary thought for a while and said: "Don't worry, how did you forget: 'If the direction is unclear, study theory.' Lead everyone to study Chairman Mao's 'On Contradiction' carefully, and you will find a way."

At the beginning of the study, everyone felt that they could not get into it, and only the group leader spoke during the discussion. At this time, the branch secretary came, guiding and guiding everyone to find contradictions from daily life problems first. After clarifying what a contradiction is, they also clarified the way to solve the contradiction. Later, the topic naturally turned to the group's efforts to increase production in order to meet the needs of the country's Great Leap Forward. However, there is a contradiction between the shortage of manpower and the heavy task. Some people said: Can it be perfect to both complete the production plan and carry out innovation? In this way, the topic turned to the question of why contradictions are both opposed and unified. Through discussion, everyone realized that there is a contradiction between drawing people out to carry out innovation and completing the production plan, but after the innovation is completed, the production plan can be better completed. Therefore, the contradiction is both opposed and unified. As the discussion deepened step by step, the topic turned to the issue of internal and external causes. Everyone said that external causes are conditions, and internal causes are the foundation. We can create conditions and learn cement pouring technology, so we don't have to wait for the capital construction department to be free. Internal causes play a decisive role, and we must give play to subjective initiative. After this study, the direction was clear and the confidence was sufficient. Everyone unanimously agreed to give full play to the subjective initiative and properly arrange various tasks, production time for production, and spare time for innovation, and the two fronts advanced simultaneously, and immediately sent people to the capital construction department to learn cement pouring technology. After everyone gave play to their subjective initiative, production was in full swing, and innovation was in full swing. The progress in both aspects was very fast. On the 15th of that month, the galvanizing production line was completed ahead of schedule, and on the 20th, the leap forward plan for Red May was completed ten days ahead of schedule, truly achieving a comprehensive leap forward in ideology, production, innovation, and so on. From then on, this group regarded studying Chairman Mao's works as an important task.

    Innovation Before Production

One day in April of this year, it was raining heavily, and it didn't stop all day. The members of the Wu Xiankang group of the Installation Workshop who were working in the outer field were unable to go to work. Everyone was waiting in the workshop with nothing to do. Because there was not much work inside the workshop, it could not use so many people, and a large amount of "idle labor" was created. Wu Xiankang was very anxious. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, time is precious. How can we just watch it be wasted in vain! He thought about it and finally came up with a solution: Everyone sits down and brainstorms to innovate for the next step of work. There are very few opportunities for the whole group to sit together and study work all day. This day, everyone came up with an idea, and I came up with an idea. With many people and wisdom, several technical and technological innovations were actually made. After the weather cleared up, these innovation projects exerted their power, making the work a big leap forward. Wu Xiankang carefully pondered: Isn't this a very good experience? This is called "Innovation Before Production." Doing so can avoid the shortcomings of "sharpening guns on the battlefield" for innovation in the past. After the innovation is completed, the work is almost completed, and the role of innovation cannot be fully exerted. He told the whole group about this new discovery, and everyone thought it was very correct.

The 6,000-ton freighter "Peace 72" started construction. The dock cycle was very short, only more than twenty days, which was shortened by nearly two-thirds compared to the "Peace 28" during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The Wu Xiankang group can only use five days and five nights, but they have to complete the workload of the past fourteen days and nights. Wu Xiankang thought: It took forty-eight hours just to pull lines and illuminate on the "Peace 28." Five days and five nights is too tight, and we must innovate. So he used the experience of "Innovation Before Production" and decided to run ahead of time to pull a pre-line first to lay a good foundation for the formal line pulling. When this suggestion was put forward in the group, everyone said it was a good idea. But there are many difficulties. The large joints of the shipbuilding workshop have not been welded well, and the side panels have not been installed completely. The ship will be deformed during welding and assembly, and the pre-line is equivalent to being pulled in vain. Everyone further discussed this difficulty and believed that the deformation of the hull must have a law. If the empirical data can be found, it can be done. They asked the Party branch about this idea. The branch secretary enthusiastically praised them for their good idea, encouraged them to be bold and do it, and said: "Behind difficulties is success, and there is knowledge in difficulties."

With the support and encouragement of the Party, everyone was more confident and immediately sent people to the shipbuilding workshop to ask experienced masters and technicians for advice. Based on the rich experience of the masters, they calculated the empirical data of possible deformation due to the steel plate heating during welding. According to this data, the Wu Xiankang group pulled a line in advance before the hull work was completed. When the hull work was over, the Wu Xiankang group formally pulled the line and illuminated it, which only took four hours, which was eleven times faster than the forty-eight hours of "Peace 28." The experience of "Innovation Before Production" is definitely a positive and good experience. According to this experience, they came up with innovations in machine installation before the ship was launched. In the process of machine installation, they were innovating in trial operation and trial voyage.

    Planning Decomposed into Parts

How to implement the production plan to each individual in the group, so that everyone has a clear goal of struggle and ensures the early realization of the plan, this is no longer a problem in several groups of the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory. Taking the Wu Xiankang group as an example: In April, production group leader Wu Xiankang received many construction cards. The construction items were written densely on the cards, and the quota man-hours were clearly marked under each project, from a few hours to thousands of hours. In the past, the group leader only needed to assign according to the project, specifying you to do this and him to do that. Everyone worked together, and no one knew who was good or bad. After everyone completed the task, they knew that the group had completed the plan, and they could not further give full play to the enthusiasm of each member of the group. This time, after grasping the group, Wu Xiankang no longer did that. He decided to implement the plan to everyone. How can it be implemented to everyone? After a discussion in the Wu Xiankang group, everyone felt that a "decomposition into parts" method should be used to divide a large project into several small projects according to each process. Then, the core team drafted the quota man-hours for each small project, solicited the opinions of the whole group, and officially announced it after being revised and supplemented by the group members. As a result, the group members knew the plan in their hearts, and seized the time to complete the quota every day. After get off work, the workers reported to the team leader, and the team leader settled accounts every day. Whoever exceeded or lagged behind, the indicator board was different every day. The quota for the main engine installation project of the "Peace 72" wheel stipulated by the factory was 4,000 man-hours. After the group was divided into the end, more than 1,000 man-hours were compressed, and each project was completed ahead of schedule.

    After Work

In the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory, in the past, when people mentioned the Wu Xiankang group, everyone would immediately associate it with hard work. Originally, they only knew how to work all day long, and they didn't leave the dock for several days and nights, and the workshop director was so anxious that he drove them off the dock. Now, if you go and take a look, it is different. Within the eight hours of work, they race against time. The workers have such a song: "The preparatory bell rings, no one 'baixiang' (plays); the work bell rings, the hammer jingles; the quitting time bell does not ring, the hand does not leave the 'jiāshēng' (tools); do eight full hours, not letting go of a second." Outside of the eight hours, it is a different scene. On class days, everyone goes to class, and the construction site is quiet. On days when there are no classes, the open space outside the workshop becomes a sports field, with tug-of-war and ball games. Wu Xiankang is a table tennis player. After get off work, he goes to find his opponent; Liu Rensong is a weightlifting strongman. After get off work, he goes to lift his barbell. Fu Lijuan is an excellent singer. She can not only sing, but also compose. She often composes the affairs of her group into songs and teaches everyone to sing. The melodious singing wafts on the Huangpu River, and the fatigue of the day disappears with the singing. The old worker Sun Yongqing does not like to sing, nor does he want to play ball. When he has some free time, he finds a quiet place to practice Tai Chi and do broadcast exercises. In the past, he often had backaches, but after several months of cultural and sports activities, he seemed to be younger and stronger.

The group grasped the combination of work and rest and the cultural and sports activities, everyone was full of energy, and production was even more energetic.

    小组开大花结满跃进果
    江南造船厂通讯组
    思想、生产、生活一齐抓，
    遍开全面跃进花；
    条条工作播下种，
    归到小组结大瓜。
    上面这首快板诗，是上海江南造船厂广大工人和干部的体会。这个厂自从今年5月份开始大抓小组工作以来，许多小组出现了全面跃进的局面，先进的小组更先进了，后进的小组也跟上来了。黄浦江岸，升起了成百面的全面跃进小组红旗。我们访问了其中的邬显康小组和金天寿小组，这里要介绍的是这两个小组的点滴情况。
    毛主席著作指方向
    这些小组，都把学习毛主席著作作为小组生活主要内容之一。毛泽东思想，给了他们不可估量的力量与智慧，推动了他们的生产。管阀车间金天寿小组，就是一个很好的例子。
    这个小组原来有二十六人，随着技术革命的深入发展，在全厂调整劳动组织时进行了调整，全组只剩下十六个人；平均技术等级不到三级。今年5月，也就是组织调整后的第一个月，这个小组的任务增加了两倍多。以往只做修船中的镀锌、蚀字工作，现在造船线上的镀锌、蚀字工作也并到这个小组里。同时，在这个月里还要完成一条镀锌生产流水线的技术革新项目。当时小组里就有人反映：“人手少了三分之一，任务多了两倍多，既要超额完成生产计划，又要搞流水线，弄不好两头落空，那才糟糕哩！”也有人说：“这个月是一个人顶三个半人的生产任务，那里还有力量搞流水线？还是顾一头保险！”还有人说：“搞镀锌流水线要铺三百七十米的耐酸水泥地，我们不懂浇水泥技术，还是等基建科来搞吧！”说来说去是生产、革新无法兼顾。
    小组长金天寿是个共产党员，他始终没有动摇，在核心小组研究后，他把小组情况一五一十向党支部作了汇报。支部书记思考了一会说：“不要急，你怎么忘了：‘方向不明学理论’，领导大家把毛主席的《矛盾论》好好学习学习，就会找到办法的。”
    开始学习时，大家觉得学不进去，讨论时只有组长一个人发言。这时支部书记来了，一面辅导，一面引导大家先从日常生活问题上寻找矛盾。弄清什么叫矛盾后，同时也明确了解决矛盾的办法。谈到后来，话题自然地转到了小组为了满足国家大跃进的需要就要努力提高生产。但人手少和任务重有矛盾。有人就说：既要完成生产计划又要搞革新能否两全其美。这样话题又转到了为什么矛盾是对立的又是统一的问题。通过讨论，大家都认识到：抽人出来搞革新与完成生产计划是有矛盾的，但革新搞成后，生产计划就可更好地完成，因此矛盾既是对立的又是统一的。讨论步步深入，话题又转到内因与外因的问题上来。大家说外因是条件，内因是基础，我们可以创造条件，学习浇水泥技术，这样就不必等基建科有没有空了，内因是起决定作用的，我们必须发挥主观能动性。这样一学习，方向明确，信心足了，大家一致同意充分发挥主观能动作用，各项工作妥善安排，生产时间搞生产，业余时间搞革新，两条战线同时并进，并立即派人到基建科学习浇水泥技术。大家发挥了主观能动作用以后，生产搞得轰轰烈烈，革新搞得热火朝天，两方面的进度都非常快。在当月15日就提前完成了镀锌流水线，20日又提前十天完成了红5月的跃进计划，真正做到了思想、生产、革新等全面跃进。从此以后，这个小组就把学习毛主席著作作为一项重要工作。
    生产未动革新先行
    今年4月的一天，大雨滂沱，整天不止，安装车间邬显康小组在外场工作的组员们都无法去工作了。大家等在车间里无事可干。因为内场工作又不多，用不了这许多人，眼看着造成了大量的“窝工”。邬显康十分焦急，在大跃进的时代里，时间就是宝，怎么能眼看着白白浪费掉呢！他左思右想，终于想到了办法：大家坐下来动脑筋，为下一步工作搞革新。整个小组整天地坐在一起研究工作的机会是很少的，这一天大家你提一个办法，我想一个主意，人多智慧广，居然搞出来好几件技术、工艺的革新。天晴以后，这些革新项目发挥了威力，使工作大大跃进了一步。邬显康仔细一琢磨：这不是一条很好的经验吗？这叫做“生产未动，革新先行”。这样做，可以不再像过去那样“阵上磨枪”搞革新，革新搞成，工作快完，不能充分发挥革新作用的缺点。他向全组谈出了这个新发现，大家都认为很对头。
    和平七十二号六千吨海轮开工了。船台周期十分短促，只有二十多天，比1958年大跃进的和平二十八号的船台周期还缩短了将近三分之二。邬显康小组可以占用的时间只有五天五夜，但要完成过去十四昼夜的工作量。邬显康想：单单拉线、照光在和平二十八号上就花了四十八小时，五天五夜可太紧了，一定得革新。于是他运用了“生产未动，革新先行”的经验，决定跑在时间前面，先拉一次预线，为正式拉线打好基础。这个建议在小组里一提出来，大家都说是好主意。但是困难很多，造船车间的大接头没焊好，傍板没装齐，在焊装时船会变形，预线等于白拉。大家针对这个困难进一步探讨，认为船体变形一定有个规律，能找出经验数据来就可以干。他们把这个想法请示了党总支，总支书记热情地夸奖他们主意想得好，鼓励他们大胆去干，并且说：“困难背后是成功，困难里边有学问。”
    得到了党的支持和鼓励，大家信心更足，马上派人到造船车间去找有经验的老师傅、技师们讨教。凭着老师傅们的丰富经验，算出了因焊接时钢板变热可能变形的经验数据，邬显康小组根据这个数据，在船体工作还没完成的时候预先拉了一次线，等船体工作一结束，邬显康小组正式拉线、照光，只用了四个小时，比和平二十八号的四十八小时整整快了十一倍。“生产未动，革新先行”的经验，更肯定是个积极的好经验了。根据这条经验，他们在船还没下水以前，又搞出了机器安装的革新。在机器安装的过程中，又在搞试车、试航的革新了。
    计划化整为零
    怎样把生产计划落实到小组每一个人，使人人明确奋斗目标，保证计划提前实现，这在江南造船厂的若干小组里，已经不算一个问题了。以邬显康小组为例：4月，生产组长邬显康接到很多施工卡，卡上面把施工的项目写得密密麻麻，每个工程项目下面都清楚地标明多少定额工时，从几个小时直至成千上万个小时。这在过去，组长只要按工程项目分配，指定你做这样，他做那一件就行了。大家混在一起干，谁好谁孬不知道，大家完成任务了，这才知道小组完成计划了，不能进一步充分发挥小组每个人的积极性。这次，抓了小组以后，邬显康不再那么干了，他决定把计划落实到每个人，怎样才能落实到每个人呢？邬显康小组一讨论，大家觉得应该来个“化整为零”的办法，把一项大工程按照各道工序化成若干小工程。接着，核心组就把每一个小工程的定额工时拟订出来，征求全组意见，经过组员修正补充后正式公布。这样做的结果，组员们人人对计划心中有数，天天抓紧时间完成定额。下班后，工人都向班长报账，班长每天结算，谁超谁脱，指标牌一天一个样。厂里规定的“和平七十二号”轮主机安装工程定额是四千工时，小组化到最后，压缩了一千多工时，而且项项工程又提前完成了。
    下班以后
    在江南造船厂，过去，一提起邬显康小组，大家马上会把它和苦干连起来。原来他们一天到晚只知道干，几天几夜不下船台，急得车间主任上船台赶他们下来。现在，你再去看看，可就不同了，在工作的八小时内，他们是分秒必争。工人有这样一首歌谣：“预备铃响，无人‘白相’（玩）；上班铃响，鎯头叮当；下班铃不响，手不离‘家生’（工具）；做足八小时，分秒也不让。”八小时以外，又是一番景象，上课的日子，大家都去上课，工地上静悄悄的。在不上课的日子里，车间外面的空地，就成了运动场，拔河的拔河，打球的打球。邬显康是乒乓球选手，下了班，他就去找他的对手；刘仁松是举重大力士，下了班，就去举他的杠铃。傅丽娟是出色的歌手，她不但会唱，还会编，常常把自己小组的事情，编成歌子，教大家唱，悠扬的歌声，在黄浦江上荡漾，一天的疲劳，就跟着歌声消失了。老工人孙永庆不喜唱歌，也不要打球，有了点空，就找一个清静的地方打太极拳，做广播操。过去，他经常腰酸背痛，经过几个月的文体活动，人好像年青了，力气也大了。
    小组抓了劳逸结合，抓了文体活动，人人精神饱满，生产更有劲了。
