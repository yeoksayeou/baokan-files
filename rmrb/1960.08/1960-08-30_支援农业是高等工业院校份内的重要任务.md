Supporting Agriculture is an Important Task for Higher Industrial Colleges
Chen Yifan, Wang Rongxiang, Wei Ming, Deputy Secretaries of the Beijing Mining College Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    Following the instructions of the Central Committee and the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Beijing Mining College organized more than 1,000 faculty, students, and staff in April this year to vigorously support agriculture in Changping and Yanqing counties. After a period of practice, we realized that in the new situation, according to the needs of the communes and the conditions of the school, the work of supporting agriculture should focus on the following aspects:

    1.  Helping communes establish industries, build and renovate factories, and solve the problem of repairing and manufacturing farm tools.

    Accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture and reforming tools is a very important link. Due to the continuous development of rural productive forces, farmers' demands for farm tool improvement and mechanical operation are becoming more and more urgent. After teachers and students arrived at the communes, helping the communes establish factories became the primary task. Taking the Mafang Farm Tool Factory of the Nankou Commune in Changping as an example, this factory was only established in mid-February this year. The factory had only one baking oven, one electric saw, two lathes, and one blower. There was only one lathe operator in the factory, and most of the others were newly transferred farmers. After the teachers and students arrived at the factory, under the leadership of the factory's Party branch and in cooperation with the workers, they immediately devoted themselves to the construction of the factory in the spirit of hard work, painstaking effort, and ingenuity. After consulting together, everyone realized that to build this factory well, it was necessary to first build a foundry workshop and cast castings to equip themselves. It was very difficult to build a foundry workshop with no equipment and no technical conditions. At this time, the workers and students tried every means. Without a cupola, they used tin buckets lined with refractory materials instead. Without refractory materials, they crushed broken pottery jars into refractory materials. Without coke, they made their own coke. Finally, they built a foundry workshop from scratch. In one month, they cast twelve larger pieces of equipment, produced more than two hundred products for equipping the factory, and trained twelve workers, greatly accelerating the construction speed of the factory. Now this factory has taken initial shape and can generally undertake the task of repairing, fitting, and manufacturing small farm tools.

    Helping communes establish industries must also solve the problem of mineral resources and power resources needed by commune industries. This is a long-term plan to help the further development of commune industries, and it is also a problem that the local Party committee and the people urgently need to solve. They said, "Yanqing County, by the Great Wall, water connects water and mountains rely on mountains, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and Guanting water, only 'black gold' is not seen." This shows how much the people of Yanqing County hope to find coal.

    After learning about this situation, we sent a geological exploration team composed of more than 20 teachers and students from the geology and coal mining departments to delve into the mountains of Yanqing, searching for coal outcrops and visiting commune members, almost running all over Yanqing County. Finally, with the help of commune members, they found a coal field.

    At the Yanqing County Fishery, we also helped repair a small hydropower station. This power station was built in 1958, but it had not been able to operate normally due to a lack of technical personnel. After joint inspection and repair by teachers and students from the mechanical and electrical engineering department and local technicians, the power station officially generated electricity on "May Day." Currently, it is mainly used for lighting, with only a small portion used for power.

    2.  Participating in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in small agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing, farm tool reform, and commune canteen cooking utensil reform.

    Teachers and students participated in the local technical innovation and technical revolution movement, first focusing on the manufacture of small agricultural machinery to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture. In this regard, teachers, students, and commune members jointly manufactured soil machinery such as corn planters, levelers, tampers, and combined seeders. Among them, the combined seeder and combined fertilizer spreader changed the original six manual operations to two semi-mechanized operations. The leveler changed the harrowing work of paddy fields from the original three procedures of two dry harrows and one water harrow to one procedure, which improved work efficiency and reduced physical labor. In addition, foot-operated blowers,窝窝头 (wōwōtóu) makers, and vegetable cutters manufactured around the reform of canteen cooking utensils were welcomed by the majority of farmers.

    Under the leadership of the factory's Party organization, students and workers of the commune-run factory jointly researched and manufactured some soil lathes, soil planers, and slotting machines, which not only reduced heavy physical labor but also improved production efficiency. The nut threading machine made by the students and commune members replaced the original manual nut threading operation, increasing the production of nut threading from the original 40 per hour to more than 200. The soil mill was modified into an electric mill, which originally required five laborers to push the mill all day, but now only one person is needed to manage it, and the work efficiency is increased by 40 times.

    In the work of supporting the countryside, as long as conditions permit, some of the latest technologies should be taught to the countryside and applied to agricultural and sideline production. At the Yanqing County State-owned Fishery, we helped farmers experiment with new fishing methods and established wireless telephone contact between fishing boats, using walkie-talkies to direct fishing boats, and so on. Some modern scientific and technological technologies have been disseminated and applied in rural areas.

    The comprehensive utilization of锅驼机 (guōtuójī) boiler-camel machines has also been promoted in rural areas. After experimentation and practice, boiler-camel machines can not only drive flour mills and water pumps, but also can be used to steam buns, cook porridge, wash vegetables, wash dishes, cook pig feed, process seeds, wash clothes, etc., so that it can play a greater role.

    In helping communes run factories and participating in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we deeply realized that we must proceed from the actual conditions of the communes and implement the principles of adapting to local conditions and making use of simple and crude methods in order to effectively accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture. In the past, most of the teachers and students participated in production labor in factories and mines, and they had more contact with large and foreign equipment. Therefore, after arriving at the communes, it is even more important to adhere to the principle of using local methods, combining local and foreign methods. At the Machikou Farm Tool Manufacturing Factory in Changping Chengguan Commune, a student wanted to make a sand screening machine. At first, he wanted to make a precise gear-driven "foreign" machine, but due to the lack of necessary equipment, he made no progress after seven or eight days. Later, under the leadership of the commune Party committee and together with the commune members, starting from reality and using a combination of local and foreign methods, he found gears, iron shafts, and other things from the waste pile, and installed a hand-cranked sand screening machine in just one day, which not only solved the problem but also was welcomed by the commune members. Facts have proved that implementing the principles of combining local and foreign methods, adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and making use of simple and crude methods, and carrying forward the spirit of hard work, painstaking effort, and ingenuity, is the correct way to develop commune-run industry quickly, well, and economically.

    3.  Helping commune members master and improve technology and training technical forces for the communes so that technology takes root in the communes is an important part of our support for agriculture. We sent teachers, students, and workers from the school's factory to the communes to deliver technology, helping the workers of the commune-run factories quickly master operating skills, helping them become familiar with the performance of machine tools, teaching them practical operating skills, general technological processes, and mechanical maintenance knowledge, and explaining some basic theoretical knowledge, such as drawing, casting, vehicle, fitter, and other types of process theory. At present, we have trained 66 workers of various types who can operate independently for the commune-run factories and trained 88 apprentices for Changping. Some workers are now able to process parts according to projection drawings.

    Based on the experiences and practical experiences summarized in the labor, combined with the needs of the farmers, the teachers and students compiled five kinds of popular lectures, such as "Maintenance and Repair of锅驼机 (guōtuójī) Boiler-Camel Machines", "Drawing", and "Casting Technology". Because these lectures are more practical and easy to understand, farmers with a certain level of education can understand them and solve some technical problems independently.

    We also help agricultural middle schools carry out scientific and technological activities, use their spare time to teach them technical knowledge, and help them learn to operate machines. Agricultural middle school students are a very important technical force in the future countryside. During their studies, paying attention to cultivating their industrial production technology has a positive effect on the further development of rural commune-run industry.

    Another important form of training technical workers is to select young commune members to go to the school's affiliated factory for longer-term training, which is a long-term plan to train technical forces for commune-run industry. After this group of technical forces returns to the commune after a certain period of training, they can further spread technology, and the rural technical team can continue to expand. At present, the Party Committee of Yanqing State-owned Fishery and several factories in Changping County have selected young apprentices to study technology at the mining machinery factory of our college.

    The school's affiliated factory has relatively complete equipment and many technicians, and bears the important task of helping communes train technical forces. It is necessary to mobilize the workers of the factory to make them clear about the great significance of supporting agriculture and give full play to their initiative and enthusiasm, which is of great benefit to strengthening the connection between workers and peasants and further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

    4.  Participating in commune field labor and learning agricultural production technology. During the spring sowing period, the students participated in labor such as sowing, fertilizing, and leveling the land, helping the commune solve the problem of labor shortage.

    The labor enthusiasm and soaring spirit of the vast number of commune members greatly educated and encouraged the students. Inspired by the excellent qualities of commune members who love the commune and love labor, the students were full of energy, and a vigorous labor competition scene appeared.

    The students also took farmers as teachers and learned agricultural production technology from them. Under the guidance of commune members, everyone initially mastered production technologies such as plowing, leveling the land, sowing, and seed selection.

    5.  Helping communes carry out sports, health, culture, and literacy activities promoted the development of the rural cultural revolution and enlivened rural cultural life.

    After the students went to the communes, they were not only a technical army and a labor army but also a cultural army. The students who worked at the Machikou Farm Tool Factory in Changping universally promoted broadcast exercises to the factory and the commune. Old men in their sixties and seventies also did broadcast exercises. The art troupe also ran all over the villages and performed on the spot. The students also helped the communes carry out literacy, propaganda, and other work, told the farmers about Chairman Mao's works, and talked about the future of communism, which was deeply welcomed by the majority of farmers.

    Through supporting agriculture, under the correct leadership and strong support of the county and commune Party committees, we have established a new base for the three-in-one combination of teaching, scientific research, and production labor in the countryside. The teachers and students have been well-tempered, and they have achieved an all-round harvest in political thought, production labor, teaching, and scientific research.

    In supporting agriculture, our teaching and scientific research have also achieved a harvest. In previous years, surveying students only repeated existing measurements as usual. This time, they fully measured the topographic map for the Yanqing Fishery, which not only helped the fishery formulate long-term development plans but also completed their teaching practice, and it was more realistic than the teaching practice in previous years. Fifty-eight students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering had not yet studied professional courses, but through the exercise of practice, they were able to design, process, and manufacture machines, which greatly improved the quality of learning. The new fishing technology and walkie-talkie command fishing boats that the teachers of the Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering helped the fishery to develop improved the ability of the students to do scientific research. Practice has proved that industrial colleges have the conditions to combine and improve teaching and scientific research work by supporting agriculture.

    Through this period of practice in supporting agriculture, we deeply realized that organizing teachers and students of higher industrial colleges to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural labor has a very important significance for the intellectualization of workers and peasants. Some people use outdated views to look at today's urban-rural relations, only requiring rural areas to support cities and schools, while saying that urban areas and schools supporting rural areas are "dispensable". Today's urban-rural relationship is a new type of socialist urban-rural relationship, and it is very necessary and natural for schools to support rural areas. At the same time, school support for rural areas has also opened up a broader path for the school to implement the party's education policy. Some people believe that students in industrial colleges can reap both ideological and technical gains by going to factories and mines to work, while they say that going to the countryside to work is a "ideological harvest, but the profession is deserted". Therefore, they came to the conclusion that "the gains do not outweigh the losses". They rigidly and one-sidedly regard business as professional knowledge, and do not see that students learn agricultural technology and participate in the labor of commune-run factories, which improves their ability to work independently. Is this not also a harvest in business? They do not understand the great significance of this for cultivating students to develop in an all-round way with one specialty and many skills. These people set business against politics, and set "red" against "expert", only calculate business accounts, do not calculate political accounts, only calculate "expert" accounts, do not calculate "red" accounts. In the final analysis, this is a concrete reflection of the bourgeois ideology of emphasizing business and neglecting politics in dealing with the issue of supporting agriculture. At the same time, it must also be seen that the support of all walks of life for agriculture and the support of cities for rural areas have a more far-reaching significance, that is, it greatly promotes the gradual disappearance of the differences between workers and peasants, the differences between urban and rural areas, and the differences between mental and physical labor, further consolidates the worker-peasant alliance, accelerates socialist construction, and prepares conditions for the future transition to communism. Therefore, supporting agriculture is a long-term task, and it is necessary to criticize all harmful wrong ideas, constantly sum up experience, and persist in this work for a long time.

    支援农业是高等工业院校份内的重要任务
    中共北京矿业学院委员会副书记  陈一凡  王荣祥  魏明
    北京矿业学院遵循中央和北京市委的指示，于今年4月组织了一千余师生员工，分赴昌平县和延庆县，大力支援农业。经过一个阶段的实践，我们体会到在新的形势下，根据公社的需要和学校的条件，支援农业的工作应该着重在以下几个方面：
    一、帮助公社兴办工业，兴建和改建工厂，解决农具的修理和制造问题。
    加速农业的技术改造，工具改革是很重要的一环。由于农村生产力的不断发展，农民对农具改良和机械操作的要求愈来愈迫切。师生到公社后帮助公社兴办工厂就成为首要的任务。以昌平南口公社的马坊农具厂为例，这个厂是今年2月中旬才成立起来的。厂里只有一个烘炉、一台电锯、二台车床、一台鼓风机。全厂只有一名车工，其他多是新调来的农民。师生到厂后，在厂党支部的领导下，与工人协作，以穷干、苦干、巧干的精神，立即投入了建厂工作。经过务虚，大家认识到要建好这个厂，必须首先兴建铸工车间，浇铸出铸件自己装备自己。在一没有设备，二没有技术条件的情况下，要兴建一个铸工车间是有许多困难的。这时，工人和同学们想尽了各种办法，没有化铁炉，就用洋铁桶砌上耐火材料代替；没有耐火材料，就以破缸瓦碾细制成耐火材料；没有焦炭，就自己炼焦。终于白手起家建立起铸工车间。一个月里即浇铸出了较大的设备十二件，为装备工厂生产了二百多件产品，培养了十二名工人，大大加快了这个厂的建设速度。现在这个厂已经初具规模，一般能担当起修配和制造小型农具的任务。
    帮助公社兴办工业还必须解决公社工业所需要的矿产资源和动力资源。这是帮助公社工业进一步发展的长远之计，也是当地党委和人民迫切需要解决的问题。他们说：“延庆县，长城边，水连水来山靠山，农林牧副官厅水，只有‘乌金’不见天。”由此可以看出延庆县人民多么希望找到煤。
    我们了解到这一情况，即派出了一支由地质、采煤两系二十多名师生组成的地质勘探队，深入延庆山区，一面寻找煤的露头，一面访问社员，几乎跑遍了延庆全县，终于在社员的帮助下找到了煤田。
    在延庆县渔场我们还帮助修复了一座小型水力发电站。这座发电站是1958年兴建起来的，由于缺乏技术力量，一直没有能正常运转。经过机电系师生和当地技术人员共同检修，这座电站已于“五一”正式发电。目前它主要是用来照明，只是一部分用作动力。
    二、参加小型农业机械修造、农具改革和公社食堂炊具改革等方面的技术革新与技术革命运动。
    师生投入当地的技术革新与技术革命运动，首先是围绕小型农业机械制造，以加速农业的技术改造。在这方面，师生和社员一起制造了玉米点种机、平地机、打夯机、联合播种机等土机械。其中联合播种机和联合撒粪机使原来手工操作的六道工序改为半机械化操作两道工序。平地机使水田的耙平工作由原来干耙两次、水耙一次的三道工序改为一道，提高了工效，减轻了体力劳动。此外围绕食堂炊具改革制造的脚踏鼓风机、窝窝头器、切菜机等，都受到广大农民的欢迎。
    学生们在厂党组织的领导下，与社办工厂工人共同研究，制造了一些土车床、土刨床和插床等，不但减轻了笨重的体力劳动，而且提高了生产效率。同学们与社员共同制成的螺母套丝机代替了原来用手工套螺母的操作，使螺母套丝的生产，由原来每小时四十个提高到二百多个，把土碾子改装成为电动碾子，原来需要五个劳动力整天推碾子，现在只需要一个人管理，还提高了工效四十倍。
    在支援农村的工作中，只要条件许可，就应该把一些最新技术传授给农村，应用于农副业生产。我们在延庆县国营渔场帮助农民试验采用新的捕鱼方法，并在渔船之间建立无线电话的联系，用报话机指挥渔船等等。某些现代科学技术已经在农村中得到传播和应用。
    锅驼机的综合利用也在农村中得到推广。经过试验和实践，锅驼机不但可以带动磨面机和水泵，还可以用来蒸馒头、煮粥、洗菜、洗碗以及煮猪饲料、处理种子、洗衣等，使它发挥了更大的效用。
    在帮助公社举办工厂和参加技术革新和技术革命运动中，我们深深体会到，必须从公社的实际条件出发，贯彻因地制宜，因陋就简的原则，才能有效地加速农业技术改造。师生们过去大都到厂矿参加生产劳动，接触的大设备、洋设备较多，因而到公社后，坚持土法上马，土洋结合的原则就更为重要。在昌平城关公社马池口农具制造厂，一个学生要制造一架筛沙机。起初他想搞精密齿轮传动的“洋”机械，由于缺乏必要的设备，搞了七、八天毫无进展。后来在公社党委领导下，和社员一起，从实际出发，用土洋结合的办法，从废料堆中找出齿轮、铁轴等，只一天工夫就安装了一架手摇筛沙机，既解决了问题，又受到社员的欢迎。事实证明，贯彻土洋结合、因地制宜、就地取材、因陋就简的原则，发扬穷干、苦干、巧干的精神，是多快好省地发展社办工业的正确道路。
    三、帮助社员掌握与提高技术，为公社培训技术力量，使技术在公社扎根，是我们支援农业的一个重要内容。我们派师生和学校工厂的工人到公社把技术送上门，帮助社办工厂的工人迅速掌握操作技术，帮助他们熟悉机床的性能，教给他们实际操作技术、一般的工艺过程和机械的维修知识，并且讲解一些基本的理论知识，如制图、铸、车、钳等工种的工艺理论等。目前，已为社办工厂培训了能独立操作的各种工种的工人六十六名，为昌平培养徒工八十八名。有些工人现在已经能够根据投影图纸加工零件。
    师生根据劳动中的体会和实际经验的总结，结合农民的需要编写出了《锅驼机的维护与修理》、《制图》《铸工工艺》等五种通俗讲义。由于这些讲义较能切合实际又容易领会，所以具有一定文化水平的农民都能读懂，并能独立解决某些技术上的问题。
    我们还帮助农业中学开展科学技术活动，利用业余时间，教给他们技术知识，帮助他们学会操作机器。农业中学的学生是未来农村中一支很重要的技术力量。在学习期间，注意培养他们的工业生产技术，对于农村社办工业的进一步发展，是有积极作用的。
    培训技术工人的另一个重要形式，是公社选派青年社员到学校的附属工厂进行较长期的培训，这是为社办工业培养技术力量的一种长远之计。这批技术力量经过一定时期的培养回到公社后，又可以进一步传播技术，农村技术队伍就可以不断扩大。目前，延庆国营渔场党委和昌平县的几个工厂都选派了青年徒工到我院矿山机械厂学习技术。
    学校附属工厂有较完善的设备，较多的技工，负有帮助公社培养技术力量的重任。必须发动工厂的工人，使他们明确支援农业的重大意义，发挥主动性和积极性，这对加强工人与农民之间的联系，进一步巩固工农联盟有很大好处。
    四、参加公社田间劳动，学习农业生产技术。学生们在春播期间参加了播种、施肥、平整土地等劳动，帮助公社解决了劳力不足的问题。
    广大社员的劳动热情和冲天的干劲对同学们教育和鼓舞很大，由于社员热爱公社、热爱劳动的优秀品质的感染，同学们干劲十足，出现了你追我赶的轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛场面。
    同学们还拜农民为师，向农民学习农业生产技术。在社员指导下，每个人都初步掌握了犁地、平整土地、播种、选种等生产技术。
    五、帮助公社开展体育、卫生、文化、扫盲活动，促进了农村文化革命的开展，活跃了农村的文化生活。
    学生下到公社后既是一支技术大军、劳动大军，又是一支文化大军。在昌平马池口农具厂劳动的学生向工厂、公社普遍推广了广播操，六、七十岁的老大爷也做起了广播操。文工团也跑遍各村，就地演出。同学们还帮助公社开展扫盲、宣传等工作，给农民讲毛主席著作，讲共产主义前途，深受广大农民的欢迎。
    通过支援农业，在县、社党委正确领导和大力支持下，使我们在农村建立了新的教学、科学研究、生产劳动三结合的基地，师生们得到了很好的锻炼，在政治思想、生产劳动、教学和科学研究等方面获得了全面丰收。
    在支援农业中，我们的教学和科学研究也得到了丰收。测量专业的学生往年只是照例重复现成的测量，这次为延庆渔场全面测量了地形图，既有助渔场制订长远发展规划，又完成了自己的教学实习，而且比往年那种教学实习更有现实意义。机58名学生尚未学过专业课，但在实习的锻炼中，已能设计、加工制造机器，大大提高了学习质量。机电系教师帮助渔场搞的捕鱼新技术和报话机指挥渔船，提高了同学们科学研究工作的能力。实践证明，工科院校支援农业，完全有条件做到结合并提高教学和科学研究工作。
    通过这一时期支援农业的实践，我们深深体会到高等工科院校组织师生下乡参加农业劳动，对知识分子工农化有着极其重大的意义。有些人用陈旧的观点看待今天的城乡关系，只要求农村支援城市，支援学校，而城市支援农村，学校支援农村就说成是“可有可无”。今天的城乡关系，是新型的社会主义的城乡关系，学校支援农村是十分必要、理所当然的事情。同时，学校支援农村，也为学校贯彻党的教育方针开辟了更为广阔的途径。有些人认为工科院校学生到厂矿劳动可以思想、技术双丰收，到农村劳动则是“思想丰收了，业务荒疏了”。因而得出“得不偿失”的结论。他们把业务死板地、片面地看成是专业知识，没有看到学生到农村学习了农业技术，参加社办工厂的劳动，提高了独立工作能力，这不也是业务上的丰收吗？他们不懂得这对于培养学生一专多能全面发展的重大意义。这些人把业务和政治对立起来，把“红”和“专”对立起来，只算业务账，不算政治账，只算“专”的账，不算“红”的账，归根到底是一种重业务、轻政治的资产阶级思想在对待支援农业问题上的具体反映。同时，还必须看到，各行各业支援农业、城市支援农村还有着更加深远的意义，这就是大大地促进了工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动差别的逐步消失，进一步巩固工农联盟，加速社会主义建设，并为将来过渡到共产主义准备条件。因此，支援农业是一个长期任务，必须批判一切有害的错误思想，不断总结经验，把这一工作长期地坚持下去。
