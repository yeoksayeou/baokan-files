Closely Combine Agricultural Science and Technology with Production Practice
    Tang County Establishes a Scientific Research Base Network for High-Yield Fields
    Qijia Shan Production Team in Ledu County Promotes Agricultural Production Through Scientific Research Activities

    (Reported by this newspaper) Tang County, Hebei Province, has universally established scientific research bases in square fields, powerfully promoting the agricultural increase production movement and the development of scientific research work.

    Tang County has engaged in large-scale square field construction and soil improvement movements for years, with large areas of cultivated land reaching the standard of garden fields. In response to this new situation, the Tang County Party Committee has adopted new measures of bringing science to the square fields, merging agricultural science research institutes at all levels, meteorological stations, and Party Secretary experimental fields into scientific research bases in square fields. At the same time, the county's scientific and technological personnel are distributed to various square fields, achieving a station for every ten thousand mu, a group for every thousand mu, and a member for every hundred mu, forming a scientific research and experiment base network covering the entire county's square fields.

    Scientific research activities such as crop cultivation and management have been universally launched in various square fields, closely combining technology and theory. This year, various square fields have conducted comparative experiments on different varieties, different sowing methods, and different irrigation and fertilization methods. During each growth stage of the crops, cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers jointly conducted field consultations and laboratory analyses, and then formulated scientific management measures such as fertilization and irrigation. Technical cadres and experienced farmers in the Xiaoxidi High-Yield Field conducted counterpart experiments. This year, they achieved a method of wheat field management with promotion and control, and adopted a series of effective scientific and technological measures. In the face of a drought of more than two hundred days without rain, the two thousand mu of high-yield wheat fields achieved a bumper harvest, and also summarized a complete set of technical data for the scientific management of wheat. The activities of various scientific research bases are also rich and varied. Generally, there are not only simple meteorological forecasting organizations and small greenhouses, but also self-made laboratory instruments, and the field crop laboratory analysis work can be solved by themselves.

    Party Secretaries at all levels in charge of agricultural production personally took command and went down to the square fields to lead scientific research work. The Party Committee also regarded the research base as a staff headquarters for directing square field production. In order to grasp the changes in soil, fertilizer and water of crops, and to provide scientific basis for fertilization and irrigation, the County Party Committee mobilized all the county's laboratory personnel in the past six months to conduct six soil tests in each square and block during each growth stage of the crops, carefully measuring the soil moisture content and the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Then, based on the more than eighteen thousand results from the tests, combined with the experience of experienced farmers, appropriate management measures were formulated.

    When armyworms were discovered in the summer corn in the Xiaoxidi High-Yield Field, the Party Committee notified other square fields to prepare for prevention, and at the same time mobilized experienced technical cadres and experienced farmers to immediately try to produce insecticidal drugs, quickly eradicating the pest.

    After technical personnel went down to the square fields, they trained a large number of technical forces for agricultural production. This year, the County Party Committee organized a science and technology lecturing group, which has toured the squares and teams, lecturing on science and technology with eight major crops as the content. Nearly 300,000 commune members attended the lectures, and the majority of commune members generally understood the main habits and growth laws of various crops, and learned practical applications. At the same time, more than 100,000 people received professional training in the square fields, improving their professional knowledge.

    With the strengthening of the technical force and the popularization of scientific and technological knowledge, the high-yield experience in various places can be summarized in a timely manner. This year, at the same time as the wheat harvest, the county has written the 1960 wheat high-yield experience, which has prepared rich scientific and technical data for striving for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Qijia Shan Production Team of the Nianbo People's Commune in Ledu County, Qinghai Province, combined large-scale high-yield square efforts with extensive agricultural scientific and technological research activities, powerfully promoting the development of agricultural science and technology and the field management of crops.

    The Qijia Shan Production Team is located in a mountainous area. From the beginning of the large-scale high-yield square movement in February of this year, the team organized a scientific research organization with cadres, youth, and experienced farmers as the core, with the content of "one school, one group, five fields, and one dragon," and launched agricultural scientific and technological research activities. "One school" is the Red and Expert School, "one group" is the technical research group, "five fields" are the experimental fields planted by cadres, youth, experienced farmers, women, and children, and "one dragon" is when promoting advanced agricultural science and technology, the Party and Youth League organizations and the technical research group closely cooperate. The Party branch makes the decision, the technical research group serves as the advisor, the cadres act as the commander, and the youth act as the vanguard.

    After these scientific research organizations were established, they took the task of summarizing and promoting agricultural production experience and studying and solving the problems existing in the current agricultural production as the main task of agricultural scientific and technological research. For example, when students of the Red and Expert School learn technical courses and conduct scientific research, they focus on the problems existing in agricultural production, with the field as the classroom and the crops as the teaching materials; they work in the fields during the day and study in the classroom at night. If new technologies and new experiences are discovered, they are first tested in the experimental fields, and then further summarized, improved, and promoted. Members of scientific research organizations often go deep into the fields to observe the growth of various crops, and when problems are discovered, they immediately hold meetings to study countermeasures. According to the living habits and activity patterns of blind rats, which often harm crop production, they proposed using zinc phosphide to make poisoned bait for large-scale poisoning, effectively stopping the rodent infestation of more than 2,900 mu of land and protecting the normal growth of crops.

    At present, the agricultural scientific and technological research activities carried out by the Qijia Shan Production Team in combination with the large-scale high-yield square efforts, under the specific leadership of the production team's Party branch, have formed a mass movement of "everyone learning agricultural science and everyone mastering agricultural science." The majority of cadres and commune members have improved their agricultural science and technology knowledge, and are more active and conscious in implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture and promoting scientific and advanced production experiences.

    本报讯　河北省唐县普遍建立方田科学研究基地，有力地推动了农业增产运动和科学研究工作的开展。
    唐县连年大搞方田建设和土壤改良运动，大片耕地达到园田化标准。针对这一新的形势，中共唐县县委采取了科学到方的新措施，把各级农业科学研究所、气象站和书记试验田合而为一，形成方田的科学研究基地。同时将全县的科学技术队伍分布到各个方田，作到了万亩有站、千亩有组、百亩有员，形成了遍布全县方田的科学研究试验基地网。
    各个方田普遍地展开了农作物的种植、管理等科学研究的活动，使技术和理论密切地结合到一起。今年，各方田都已经作了不同品种、不同播种形式、不同浇水和施肥等对比试验。对作物每个生长发育阶段，也都经过干部、技术员和老农共同进行田间会诊和化验分析，然后制订出施肥、浇水等科学管理措施。小西堤丰产方技术干部和老农共同进行对口试验，在今年作到了有促进、有控制的麦田管理方法，并采取了一系列有效的科学技术措施，在二百多天无雨的干旱情况下，使二千亩小麦丰产方，获得了大丰收，同时还总结出一整套科学管理小麦的技术资料。各个科学研究基地的活动内容，也是丰富多采的。一般不仅有简易的气象预报组织和小温室，而且还有自造的化验仪器，田间作物的化验分析工作都能够自己解决。
    各级主管农业生产的书记都亲自挂帅，下到方田领导科学研究工作。党委也把研究基地当作指挥方田生产的参谋部。为了掌握土壤与作物的肥水变化，给施肥、浇水提出科学依据，半年来，县委曾调动全县化验人员，在作物每个生长发育阶段，逐方逐块地进行了六次土壤化验，细致地测定了土壤含水率多少，含氮、磷、钾多少，然后根据化验出的一万八千多个结果，结合老农经验，制定出适宜的管理措施。
    小西堤丰产方的夏玉米发现了粘虫，党委一方面通知其他方田作好预防准备，同时调动有经验的技术干部和老农立即试制杀虫的药剂，很快根除了这一病虫害。
    技术人员下到方田以后，为农业生产培养了大批技术力量。县委在今年组织了科学技术讲师团，曾先后巡回到方、到队，以八大作物为内容讲授科学技术，听讲的社员近三十万人，广大社员普遍懂得了各种作物的主要习性、生长规律，并学会了实际应用。同时，在方田里有十万多人受到了专业训练，提高了专业知识。
    随着技术队伍的壮大和科学技术知识的普及，也就使各地的丰产经验能够及时地进行总结。今年在小麦收获的同时，全县已写出1960年小麦丰产经验，这就又为争取明年的小麦大丰收准备了丰富的科学技术资料。
    本报讯　青海省乐都县碾伯人民公社祁家山生产队，结合大搞丰产方广泛开展农业科学技术的研究活动，有力地推动了农业科学技术的发展和农作物的田间管理工作。
    祁家山生产队位于山区。从今年2月大搞丰产方运动时起，该队就以干部、青年、老农为核心，组织起了以“一校、一组、五田、一条龙”为内容的科学研究组织，展开了农业科学技术研究活动。“一校”就是红专学校，“一组”就是技术研究小组，“五田”就是干部、青年、老农、妇女、少年种植的试验田，“一条龙”就是在推广先进的农业科学技术时，党、团组织和技术研究小组，密切配合，由党支部作决定，技术研究小组当参谋，干部任指挥，青年当先锋。
    这些科学研究组织成立起来以后，都把总结、推广农业生产经验，研究解决当前农业生产中存在的问题，当作农业科学技术研究的主要任务。例如红专学校的学员，在学习技术课和进行科学研究时，即做到了以农业生产中存在的问题为对象，以田间为课堂，以作物为教材；白天在田间劳动，晚上在教室研究，发现有新技术、新经验，立即在试验田先行试验，然后进一步总结、提高和推广。科学研究组织的成员经常深入田间，观察各种农作物的生长情况，发现问题便马上开会研究对策。他们根据经常为害庄稼生产的瞎老鼠的生活习性与活动规律，提出用磷化锌制成毒饵大面积毒杀的办法，有效地制止了二千九百多亩地的鼠害，保护了庄稼的正常生长。
    目前，祁家山生产队结合大搞丰产方开展的农业科学技术研究活动，在生产队党支部的具体领导下，已经形成了一个“人人学习农业科学，人人掌握农业科学”的群众运动。广大干部和社员提高了农业科学技术知识，对贯彻农业“八字宪法”，推广科学的先进生产经验，更加积极和自觉。（附图片）
