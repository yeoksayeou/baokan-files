    Weeds are the great enemy of crops. They not only compete with crops for fertilizer, but also compete with crops for air and sunlight. At their most rampant, they can even bully crops to the point where they cannot grow at all. It is precisely because of this that recently, various localities have mobilized the masses to vigorously weed, and have achieved great results. However, the season of high temperatures and abundant rain has not yet passed. Such natural conditions are conducive to both crop development and weed proliferation. When one batch of weeds is eliminated, new weeds will grow after a rain. In many areas, the threat of weeds to crops has not yet passed, and intensifying weeding remains one of the important tasks of field management.
    Judging from the current situation, to intensify weeding and eliminate potential weed infestations, attention should be paid to the following: First, thoroughly break the idea that "the crops are about to ripen, and extra work is useless," and act in accordance with the spirit of "work until the crops are harvested." In the later stages of crop growth, although the stalks have basically grown, their life activities are still vigorous. If there are weeds, they will still hinder their growth. Everyone knows that in the later stages of crop growth, topdressing should also be appropriately increased to promote full grain, improve quality and increase weight. However, if topdressing is not combined with weeding, it is equivalent to sending nutrients to the weeds, which will be counterproductive. Only on the basis of removing weeds can the role of these yield-increasing measures be fully exerted through topdressing, watering, and pest control. In the previous period, the Kongtong People's Commune in Pingliang City, Gansu Province, did not pay close attention to autumn field management, and some commune members believed that "the overall situation has been decided, and extra work is useless," so the weeds were not cleaned thoroughly. Recently, cadres at all levels of the commune conducted extensive publicity and education among commune members, making them fully aware of the importance of thoroughly weeding. At the same time, more than 100 strong laborers were transferred, and in two days, they weeded more than 4,590 mu and topdressed more than 5,100 mu. Many crops that were originally growing poorly turned prosperous, showing that later field management can still play a significant role.
    Second, conduct thorough inspections and take timely action. The current climate is changing rapidly, and weeds are also growing quickly. Inspections should be carried out frequently, field by field, and weeds should be removed in a timely manner when they are discovered. The 790,000 mu of autumn crops in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, originally grew very well. Some cadres and commune members once became blindly optimistic, relaxed inspections, and did not carry out timely inter-tillage and topdressing. Some fields experienced fairly serious weed infestations, and some fields experienced pest infestations. The county party committee organized leading cadres from communes and management areas to conduct in-depth inspections of autumn field management, and launched a campaign to "weed once more, topdress once more, and control pests once more." The number of commune members participating in autumn field management in the county increased from 60,000 to 110,000, and more than 40,000 mu were weeded and topdressed every day, doubling the speed compared to ten days ago.
    Third, concentrate labor and fight annihilation battles. Using the main labor force in the fields is the key to quickly eliminating weed infestations. Why are some areas acting quickly and some areas acting slowly? The key lies in whether the cadres have the determination. As long as the cadres and masses in areas with serious weed infestations truly realize that intensifying weeding is a battle to seize grain and the primary task in the local area for a certain period of time, they will mobilize labor from all aspects to fight this battle well. In August, the Pingliang area of Gansu Province experienced continuous heavy rains, and weeds grew rapidly. The Pingliang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party led all counties and cities in the area, using more than 210,000 commune members as the backbone, absorbing more than 120,000 urban residents, office cadres, and students returning home for vacation, forming more than 4,700 weeding teams, carrying out timely inter-tillage, and preventing potential weed infestations.
    Fourth, combine inter-tillage and weeding to vigorously carry out green manure and fertilizer production. Weeds growing in the fields will compete with crops for nutrients if they are not removed; if they are removed early for green manure and fertilizer production, they will turn into fertilizer. The Xuji Commune in Liu'an County, Anhui Province, simultaneously weeded and accumulated fertilizer, weeding more than 30,000 mu in seven days. They stepped on the weeds while weeding in the paddy fields and sprinkled lime to promote rapid fermentation of the weeds into fertilizer. The 5,000 mu of third-class rice seedlings turned from yellow to black in a few days due to the fertilizer. They also composted the weeds from more than 15,000 mu of dry land into 1.2 million dan of compost, 70% of which has already been applied to the fields. This approach deserves great promotion.

### 继续加紧锄草

    继续加紧锄草
    杂草是庄稼的大敌。它不仅跟庄稼争肥料，而且跟庄稼争空气、争阳光。它最猖獗的时候，甚至可以欺侮得庄稼根本不能生长。正是因为这样，所以最近以来，各地发动群众，大力锄草，取得了很大的成绩。但是，高温多雨的季节还没有过去，这样的自然条件，既利于庄稼发育，也利于杂草滋蔓。一批杂草消灭了，一场雨后，新的杂草又会生出来。在不少地区，杂草对庄稼的威胁还没有过去，加紧锄草仍然是田间管理的重要任务之一。
    根据当前的情况来看，加紧锄草，消灭可能发生的草荒，应当注意这几件事：一、大破“庄稼快熟了，加工不顶事”的思想，按照“庄稼不收，加工不休”的精神办事。庄稼生长后期，秸秆虽已基本长成，生命活动仍然旺盛，如有杂草，还会妨碍它的生长。谁都知道，在庄稼生长后期，还应该适当增施追肥，促使籽粒饱满，增质增重。可是，如果追肥不跟除草结合起来，就等于为杂草送了养分，将会得不偿失。只有在除净杂草的基础上进行追肥、浇水、治虫，才能充分发挥这些增产措施的作用。甘肃平凉市崆峒人民公社前一时期秋田管理抓得不紧，部分社员认为“大局已定，加工也不顶事了”，以致草锄的不干净。最近公社各级干部在社员中进行广泛的宣传教育，使社员充分认识了彻底锄草得重要性，同时增调了一百多个强劳力，两天工夫，锄草四千五百九十多亩、追肥五千一百多亩。许多原来长得不好的庄稼转而欣欣向荣，可见后期田间管理还能发生很大的作用。
    二、深入检查，及时行动。当前气候变化很快，杂草长得也快，应该经常检查，并且一块田一块田的检查，发现杂草，及时锄掉。陕西长安县七十九万亩秋田的庄稼原来长得很好，部分干部和社员一度产生了盲目乐观情绪，放松了检查，没有及时中耕、追肥，有些田里发生了相当严重的草荒现象，有些田里发生了虫害。县委组织公社、管理区的领导干部深入检查了秋田管理情况，开展了“再锄一次草，再追一次肥，再治一次虫”的运动，全县参加秋田管理的社员由六万人增至十一万人，每天锄草、追肥四万多亩，进度比十天前加快了一倍。
    三、集中劳力，打歼灭战。把主要劳力用在田间，是迅速消灭草荒的关键。为什么有些地区动作很快，有些地区动作很慢呢？关键在于干部有无决心。只要杂草严重地区的干部群众真正认识到加紧锄草是一场夺粮之战，是当地在一定时间内的首要工作，他们就会从各方面调集劳力，把这一仗打好。甘肃平凉专区8月连降透雨，杂草丛生，来势很猛。中共平凉地委领导全区各县、市以二十一万多社员为骨干，吸收城镇居民、机关干部和假期返乡学生十二万多人，组成四千七百多个锄草队，及时中耕，防止了可能发生的草荒。
    四、结合中耕除草，大搞压青沤肥。杂草长在田里，如果不锄，就与庄稼争养料；如果及早锄掉，压青沤肥，它就会变成肥料。安徽六安县徐集公社锄草、积肥同时动手，七天之内，锄草三万多亩。他们在水田里随锄随踩，并且撒上石灰，促使杂草迅速发酵，变成肥料；五千亩水稻三类苗由于得到肥料，几天就由黄变黑了。他们还把一万五千多亩旱田里的草，沤成一百二十万担堆肥，其中的70％已经施到田里。这种作法值得大加提倡。
