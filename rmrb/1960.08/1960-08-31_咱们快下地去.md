    In Our Commune

    Let's Hurry to the Fields
    The members of the commune busily worked through the dog days of summer, and the crops of the Yuanping Commune grew strong and green.
    Although "After the Autumn Begins, Hang up the Hoe" is an old saying, some commune members wanted to relax and take a break. On the way home from work, female commune members Mu Lanzhi and Wang Quanying discussed it: "Aunt, now that Autumn Begins has passed, our crops are growing so well, I'd like to take a few days off to take apart and wash the cotton clothes." Wang Quanying said in agreement, "Yes, that's what I was thinking too."
    Early the next morning, Lanzhi went to find Quanying, greeting her as soon as she entered the door: "Aunt, let's go quickly!" Quanying was washing her face in the room and hurriedly replied: "Look how anxious you are, you haven't even washed your face, and you're already busy asking for leave!" Lanzhi said:
  "All the women in the team have left, leaving only the two of us." "What, are you still afraid of missing the leave?" Quanying said: "Oh, you're still thinking about asking for leave? Last night, the commune Party committee issued a call: After the Autumn Begins, work even harder. All autumn fields must be fertilized again to strive for a better autumn harvest. The women commune members have all gone to fertilize. The captain said that the sewing group can take care of taking apart and washing clothes, so we don't have to worry about it. Therefore, I don't want to ask for leave." "So that's how it is, let's hurry to the fields!" Saying this, she and Quanying took their fertilizing tools and hurried to the fields to participate in fertilization.

    咱们快下地去
    社员们紧张地忙过三伏天，原平公社的庄稼长得又茁壮又油绿。
    “立了秋，挂锄钩”虽说是老“皇历”，可是有的社员却想松口气歇一歇。收工回家的路上，女社员穆兰枝和王全英就商量开了：“他婶子，现在已经立秋过了，咱们的庄稼长得这样好，我想请几天假，拆洗拆洗棉衣。”王全英不约而同地说：“是呀，我也这么想。”
    第二天一早，兰枝就去找全英，一进门就打招呼说：“他婶子，快走吧！”全英正在屋里洗脸，忙答应道：“看你急的，脸还没洗，就忙着请假！”兰枝说：
  “全队妇女都走了，就剩下咱俩了。”“怎么，你还怕误了请假吗？”全英说：“啊哟，你还想着请假的事哪？昨晚公社党委提出号召：立了秋，更加油，所有秋田要再施一次追肥，争取秋季有更好的收成。妇女社员都去追肥了。队长说，拆洗衣服有缝纫组给办，不用咱操心。因此，我不想请假了。”“原来是这样，咱们快下地吧！”说着，她俩就带上了施肥的家具，三步并作两步地奔往田间，参加追肥去了。
