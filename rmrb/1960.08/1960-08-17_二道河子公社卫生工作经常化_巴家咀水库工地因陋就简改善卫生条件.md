	Erdaohezi Commune Regularizes Health Work
	Bajiazui Reservoir Construction Site Improves Sanitation Conditions Economically
	(Reported by this newspaper) Changchun City's Erdaohezi People's Commune, in the spring and summer patriotic health campaign, has fully utilized the advantages of the urban people's commune and has completed more than ten fundamental sanitation projects, fundamentally changing the health landscape of the entire commune.
	After the establishment of the Erdaohezi People's Commune, the Party Committee immediately determined that this year's patriotic health work would focus on fundamental solutions, combined with temporary measures, and launched a mass movement of communist collaboration, mobilizing the entire commune to carry out fundamental projects and fundamentally change the commune's health outlook. Currently, the entire commune has basically completed more than ten fundamental projects, including the radical treatment of the stinky mud pond in Heshun Park, the radical treatment of the five major "lotus ponds" in Balibao, the transformation of open sewage ditches on various streets into underground culverts, the renovation of toilets, the harmless treatment of粪便 (sealed fermentation), and the construction of infiltration wells.
	At present, the commune's health work has further moved towards regularization. Everyone has initially developed good habits of loving cleanliness and hygiene. Every household is clean and tidy. Everyone is healthy, happy, and living a happy and actively working life.
	(Reported by this newspaper) The Bajiazui Reservoir construction site in Pingliang Special Zone, Gansu Province, overcame difficulties such as a large number of people, high mobility, and relatively poor living and medical hygiene conditions, vigorously launched a patriotic health campaign, achieving no infectious diseases on the construction site, no lice among the migrant workers, no feces outside the toilets, and a clean and beautiful outdoor environment, ensuring the health of the migrant workers and greatly improving work efficiency.
	Bajiazui Reservoir is located in Dongzhiyuan in eastern Gansu. Because the area around the reservoir dam site was originally a wilderness, there were some difficulties in terms of accommodation, medical care and sanitation for the migrant workers during construction. The Party Committee of Bajiazui Reservoir, based on the large number of migrant workers on the construction site, the concentration of population, and the high mobility, mobilized the masses to focus on sanitation and epidemic prevention work in a simple and economical manner. They built more than 500 tunnel-type, dark-groove, and elevated toilets and more than 700 temporary latrines around the construction site, dormitories, and roads to and from work. Special personnel were assigned to take care of the toilets, areas, and manure management, ensuring timely concealment and sealing and timely cleaning. The headquarters also distributed 2,000 jin of lice-killing powder and 470 packages of "228" agents to the migrant workers and took comprehensive measures such as chemical killing, steaming, scalding, boiling, roasting, branding, washing, and sunning to eliminate lice. The construction site has male and female bathhouses. Each regiment, battalion, and company has hygiene covenants, and there are daily hygiene duty officers who clean the environment, remove garbage, and turn over and dry bedding and straw mats for everyone according to the eighteen hygiene management areas divided by the entire construction site. At the same time, the migrant workers used the scattered land in front of the kiln and in the courtyard to plant pumpkins, sunflowers, potatoes, and some flowers, combining sanitation work with beautifying the environment, greatly improving the living and accommodation conditions on the construction site.
	To comprehensively arrange the lives of workers by focusing on the hygiene management of food and accommodation is another important experience of this reservoir construction site. In the work of improving migrant workers' diet, first, a strict political review and physical examination were conducted when selecting cooks, ensuring that there were no sick people among the cooks. The construction site widely established boiled water stations and implemented zoned management of drinking water and washing water according to upstream and downstream areas. In addition, the construction site also set up twenty-four life service points, and each regiment and battalion had barbershops, sewing departments, tofu workshops, shoe repair groups, breeding farms, laundry and repair groups, etc. The construction site headquarters also set up a temporary hospital, established medical stations in each regiment, and set up a rescue station on the dam surface at the construction site. Sixty health workers were trained from among the migrant workers, one per company, to provide medical treatment with the army, treating illnesses wherever they occurred.
	The vigorous development of the patriotic health campaign on this construction site has ensured the health of the migrant workers and the high-speed progress of the project. Since the start of construction, there has not been a single case of infectious disease on the construction site. Every migrant worker is healthy, energetic, and the attendance rate has been maintained at over 98%. (Attached picture)

    二道河子公社卫生工作经常化
    巴家咀水库工地因陋就简改善卫生条件
    本报讯　长春市二道河子人民公社在春夏季爱国卫生运动中，充分发挥城市人民公社的优越性，已经完成了十多项卫生治本工作，从根本上改变了全公社的卫生面貌。
    二道河子人民公社建立后，党委即确定了今年爱国卫生工作以治本为主，本标兼施，并开展共产主义大协作的群众运动，调动全公社的力量，大搞治本工作，根本改变了公社的卫生面貌。现在全公社根治和顺公园臭泥塘、根治八里堡的五大“莲池”、各街道污水明沟变暗渠、整修厕所、粪便无害化处理（密封发酵）、修渗水井等十多项治本工作已基本完成。
    目前，全公社卫生工作已进一步走向经常化，人人初步养成爱清洁讲卫生的良好习惯，家家户户干净整洁，人人身体健康，心情舒畅，生活愉快，劳动积极。
    本报讯　甘肃省平凉专区巴家咀水库工地克服了人多、流动性大、居住和医药卫生条件比较差等困难，大搞爱国卫生运动，做到工地无传染病，民工无虱子，厕所以外无粪便和室外整洁美观，保证了民工身体健康，工效大为提高。
    巴家咀水库位于甘肃东部的董志塬。由于这个水库大坝所在地周围原来是一片荒原，施工中民工的住宿和医疗卫生等方面都存在着一些困难。中共巴家咀水库党委根据工地民工多、人口集中、流动性大，因陋就简地发动群众大抓卫生防疫工作。他们在工地和宿舍周围、上下工的路旁建起了坑道式、暗槽式、楼台式厕所五百多个，临时便池七百多个，并设有专人包厕所、包区域、包粪便管理，做到随时匿封密闭及时清理。指挥部还给民工发了两千斤灭虱粉，四百七十包“二二八”剂等药物，采取药杀、蒸、烫、煮、烤、烙、洗、晒等综合措施消灭虱子。工地设有男、女浴室。各团、营、连都订有卫生公约，每天有卫生轮流值日员，按照全工地划分的十八个卫生管理区，打扫环境，清除垃圾和给大家翻晒被褥、铺草。同时，民工们利用窑前院内的零星土地，种上南瓜、向日葵、洋芋和一些花草，使卫生工作和美化环境相结合，大大改善了工地生活住宿条件。
    以搞好饮食和居住的卫生管理为纲，全面安排好职工的生活，是这个水库工地另一条重要经验。在搞好民工饮食工作中，首先在选拔炊事员时，进行了严格的政治审查和身体检查，做到炊事员中无病号。工地广设了开水站和对饮用水、洗衣用水按上下游实行了划区管理。此外，工地还设立了二十四个生活服务点，各团、营都有理发室、缝纫部、豆腐坊、修鞋组、饲养场、洗衣缝补等组。工地指挥部还设有临时医院，在各团设立了医疗点，在施工现场的坝面上设有救护总站。从民工中培训了六十名保健员，每连一人随军治疗，哪里有病哪里治。
    这个工地爱国卫生运动的蓬勃开展，保证了民工的身体健康和工程高速度进展。开工以来，工地上没有发生过一起传染病，民工个个身体健康，精力旺盛，出勤率保持在98％以上。（附图片）
