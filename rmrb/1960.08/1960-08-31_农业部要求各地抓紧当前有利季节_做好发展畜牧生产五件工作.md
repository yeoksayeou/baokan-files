Xinhua News Agency — The Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a notice requiring all regions to seize the current critical season for animal husbandry production and conscientiously carry out the following tasks:

	I. Storing Winter Fodder
	Seize the great season of August and September, when the temperature is high, rainfall is abundant, and all kinds of grasses are growing, to rapidly launch a mass movement of large-scale collection and storage of fodder, in order to store a large amount of fodder for this winter and next spring, ensuring surplus during the peak season and no shortage during the off-season, supplementing the off-season with the peak season. Each people's commune should calculate the fodder needs and sources based on the existing number of livestock and the next development plan, and strive to have a certain amount of reserves. The silage of corn stalks during the autumn harvest should be particularly emphasized. The work of collecting and storing fodder can be combined with field management to eliminate weeds, so that "going to the fields is never empty-handed, and returning with a basket of grass." The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee decided to squeeze out ten days before and after August 23 to mobilize the entire party and all the people to launch a concentrated grass-cutting campaign. This arrangement can be used as a reference for other regions. Doing a good job in grass-cutting in pastoral areas is even more important to ensure the safe overwintering and spring passage of livestock in pastoral areas. Each prefecture (league) and county (banner) in pastoral areas should list grass-cutting as a central task in the autumn, arrange sufficient labor, and organize several campaigns to ensure the completion of the grass-cutting plan. All the grass cut down in various places should be dried, transported, and stored in time to prevent mold and deterioration.

	II. Do a Good Job of Autumn Livestock Breeding Work
	Autumn is the peak season for breeding large livestock due to the abundance of green fodder and the robustness of livestock. In the northern regions, due to the drought in the first half of the year, the growth of green grass was not good, and livestock were generally relatively weak, so the breeding effect was not very good. It is necessary to check and supplement breeding in the fall. During the period when farming is less busy in the Northeast, livestock have fewer agricultural tasks, making it an even better opportunity for breeding. The southern regions have a tradition of autumn breeding and should seize the opportunity to carry out breeding. It is advocated that breeding should not be done once and for all, but until the breeding is successful, in order to lay a good foundation for increasing the number of livestock next year. In order to resolve the contradiction between reproduction and draft power and to take into account both reproduction and draft power, all regions should establish large-scale breeding farms (teams) for female livestock, appropriately concentrating female livestock for breeding, or temporarily concentrating female livestock for breeding during the breeding period. In mountainous areas with many livestock, it is necessary to establish pastures and breeding bases. This is a good way to give full play to the superiority of the large-scale and public nature of the people's communes and accelerate the development of large livestock.

	Do a good job in autumn pig breeding and launch a "movement to have each sow produce another litter before the end of the year." Currently, some of the sows in the country have been empty for a long time, so they must be bred to full term. Some have just produced piglets and should be bred in a timely manner to prevent emptiness.

	Autumn is also the season for breeding and improving sheep, so seize the opportunity to do a good job.

	III. Do a Good Job in Livestock Fattening and Recovery
	For livestock that are not currently in use or cannot be used due to leanness, as well as weaned young livestock, seize the current season of abundant green grass to organize the movement of livestock to graze on grass, on mountains, and in gullies, so that they can gain weight and recover in a short period of time, and prepare livestock power for the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing. The fattening work of large and small livestock in pastoral areas must be done well. Experience has shown that if the fattening and recovery work of livestock is not done well at this time, there will inevitably be cases of leanness and death in winter and spring.

	In addition, using idle land, barren mountains, and wasteland to graze pigs is a clever way to save feed and raise good pigs, and should be vigorously promoted.

	IV. Carry Out Autumn Incubation of Poultry
	Key poultry-raising areas in the south with autumn incubation habits should immediately launch an autumn incubation movement. The development of autumn poultry production should fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties. It is advocated that every family incubates and every household raises poultry, with each person raising one bird. Pig farms and various livestock farms of the people's communes should raise poultry, and orchards, mulberry gardens, and tea gardens should raise chickens. People's communes with conditions should run poultry farms, and all state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms should vigorously develop poultry production. Government agencies, organizations, factories, and schools should also continue to develop poultry production.

	V. Do a Good Job in Autumn Veterinary Disease Prevention and Control
	Universal preventive injections should be given to pigs for several major infectious diseases to expand the number of immune animals. Efforts should be made to strengthen the prevention and control of swine enzootic pneumonia and piglet white scour to ensure the great development of pigs in the second half of the year. Universal sheep dipping and internal parasite control should be carried out to reduce sheep deaths. (Attached picture)

    农业部要求各地抓紧当前有利季节
    做好发展畜牧生产五件工作
    新华社讯　农业部最近发出通知，要求各地抓紧当前畜牧业生产的关键性季节，切实作好以下几项工作：
    一、贮备冬季饲草
    抓紧8、9月份气温高、雨水多、百草丛生的大好季节，迅速开展大采、大贮饲草的群众运动，为今冬明春贮备大量的饲草，作到旺季有余，淡季不缺，以旺补淡。每个人民公社都要根据现有牲畜头数和下一步的发展计划，计算出饲草需要量和来源，努力做到有一定的贮备。在秋收时对玉米秸青贮尤应抓紧。采贮饲草工作可以和田间管理消灭草荒结合起来，做到“下地不空手，回来一筐草”。山西省委、省人民委员会决定在8月23日前后，坚决挤出十天时间，动员全党全民开展一次突击打草运动，这种安排可供各地参考。做好牧区的打草工作，对于保证牧区牲畜安全越冬渡春更为重要，牧业区各州（盟）、县（旗）应该把打草工作列为秋季一项中心任务，安排足够的劳力，组织几次战役，保证打草计划的完成。各地打下来的草都要随晒、随运、随贮，晒干藏好，防止霉烂变质。
  二、做好秋季牲畜配种工作
    秋季青饲料多、畜膘壮，是大牲畜配种旺季。北方地区上半年因天旱，青草生长不好，牲畜一般比较瘦弱，配种效果不很好，在秋季一定要查胎补配。东北地区挂锄期间，牲畜农活减少，更是配种的良机。南方地区向有秋配习惯，更应抓紧进行配种。提倡配种不论遍，达到配准为止，为明年多增加牲畜打好基础。为解决繁殖和使役的矛盾，作到繁殖和使役兼顾，各地都要大办母畜繁殖场（队），适当集中母畜进行繁殖，或者在配种期间把母畜临时集中起来配种。在牲畜多的山区要大办牧场建立繁殖基地，这是充分发挥人民公社一大二公优越性加快大牲畜发展速度的好办法。
    做好秋季猪配种工作，开展“年前每头母猪再产一窝仔运动”。目前全国母猪中有一部分是长期空怀的，一定要配种，达到满怀。有些是刚产过仔的，也要及时配种，不使空怀。
    秋季也是羊子配种改良的季节，要抓紧时机做好。
  三、做好牲畜抓膘复壮工作
    对目前暂不使用和因瘦弱不能使用的牲畜以及断奶的幼畜，要抓紧当前青草繁茂季节，组织移畜就草、上山下滩放牧，使其在短期内增膘复壮，为秋收秋耕秋播做好畜力准备。牧区大小牲畜的抓膘工作都要做好。经验证明，如果在这个时候做不好牲畜的抓膘复壮工作，冬春就难免发生瘦弱死亡情况。
    此外，利用空茬地、荒山荒地放牧养猪，是省饲料养好猪的巧办法，要大力推广。
          四、开展家禽秋孵工作
    南方有秋孵习惯的重点养禽地区，要立即开展秋孵运动。发展秋季家禽生产，应该充分调动各方面的积极性。提倡家家孵、户户养，每人养一只禽。人民公社的养猪场和各种畜牧场都要饲养家禽，果园、桑园、茶园要养鸡。有条件的人民公社要办养禽场，所有国营农牧场都要大力发展家禽生产。机关、团体、工厂、学校也要继续发展家禽生产。
          五、作好秋季兽疫防治工作
    要普遍进行猪的几种主要传染病的预防注射，扩大免疫头数。要大力加强猪气喘病和仔猪白痢的防治工作，以保证下半年猪只的大发展。要普遍开展羊只药浴和内寄生虫防治工作，减少羊只死亡。（附图片）
