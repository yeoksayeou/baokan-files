    Seven or eight years ago, Hu Wanchun, a steel worker from Shanghai who was still semi-illiterate, has become an outstanding young writer under the cultivation of the Party, by conscientiously studying Chairman Mao's works and diligently studying culture. Hu Wanchun started as an apprentice at the age of thirteen and worked in a steel factory from the age of seventeen. He began professional writing in 1958. Because he consistently listened to the Party, studied diligently, and immersed himself in life, he has written more than 700,000 words of works in seven or eight years. This is worker-writer Hu Wanchun (second from the left) adhering to eating, living, and laboring with the workers, and chatting with the workers about their daily lives after work.

    七、八年前还是个半文盲的上海钢铁工人——胡万春，在党的培养下，认真学习毛主席著作、刻苦学习文化，已成为一个优秀的青年作家。胡万春从十三岁当学徒，十七岁起在钢厂做工，一九五八年从事专业创作。由于他一贯听党的话，刻苦学习，深入生活，在七、八年间写出了七十多万字的作品。这是工人作家胡万春（左二人）坚持和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，下班后和工人谈家常。郭昌喜摄（新华社稿）
