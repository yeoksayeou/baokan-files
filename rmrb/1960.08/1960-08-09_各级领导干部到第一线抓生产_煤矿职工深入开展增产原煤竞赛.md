Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, August 8th: Fuxin Coal Mine, on the basis of overfulfilling the July production plan, overfulfilled the state's raw coal production plan by 746 tons in the first five days of August. Tunneling exceeded the state plan by 25.8%, an increase of 6.83% over the average daily progress in July.

To ensure high coal production, Fuxin Coal Mine organized technical performance competitions for the best tunneling teams in each mine in July, enabling the combination of eleven advanced technologies into a set and rapidly promoting them in various mines.

Since August, underground tunneling teams in various mines have launched a high-speed tunneling competition movement with a monthly progress of two thousand meters. From the 1st to the 4th, the Ping'an Mine tunneled 1,518 meters, an average of 380 meters per day, an increase of 18.3% over the average monthly progress in July. In the process of vigorously grasping production preparation, various mines also carried out comprehensive maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment, which powerfully guaranteed the sustained high production of coal in August.

In the movement to increase the production of raw coal, leading cadres at all levels were devolved, and more than 1,100 cadres above the level of pit section chief in the entire mining area set up camp on the front line of production. The party and government leading organs of the mine moved to the production site to work, and underground offices were established at the pit entrances. Some mine party committee secretaries, mine directors, and pit chiefs were devolved to take on the leadership work of pit section chiefs, solving problems practically and realistically on the front line of production.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 8th: Workers at Kailuan Coal Mine have set off a new upsurge in production. From August 1st to 5th, the average daily output of coal increased by 2.44% compared to late July.

In order to achieve a substantial increase in production in the third quarter, various mines held worker representative meetings at the beginning of August, challenging and responding to challenges, and launching the "one top several" competition movement. Workers of the water mining team No. 3 of Tangjiazhuang Mine researched a new production method in the competition. Although twenty-eight laborers were transferred to support the dry port retreat tunneling, they still overproduced more than 500 tons of coal every day. In the competition, various mines also selected more than forty pacesetters, such as tunneling expert Ren Guangjin, Li Changliang, and coal mining vanguard Li Baitang, to spread and perform new technologies in various mines. Through the spread and performance of techniques, the 1033 working face of Linxi Mine solved the problem of "dropping lumps" from the coal wall, and the daily output increased from 1,100 tons to 1,700 tons.

Party committee secretaries, factory directors, and engineers of various mines in Kailuan Coal Mine went deep into the front line of production to effectively help solve the weak links in production. Since the end of July, as coal production has continued to increase, transportation capacity has been unable to meet the needs of production. Leading cadres of various mines went deep into the transportation departments to fiercely attack the transportation bottleneck. Yan Ziqing, deputy director of Majiagou Mine, studied with veteran workers during follow-up labor and adjusted the coal winding time, increasing the underground coal output time from the original six hours to seven hours.

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: The Jingsi Mining Bureau, which overfulfilled its coal mining and tunneling plans in the first seven months of this year, achieved new growth in output in the first seven days of August. The bureau's raw coal output and total tunneling footage exceeded the state plan by 11.7% and 2.99% respectively, and the average daily output and average footage exceeded the level of the same period in July.

After entering August, the workers of the Jingsi Mining Bureau further launched a production competition. Leading cadres and staff members of the Datai Coal Mine also went down the well to participate in production and direct the battle. Under the personal command of the leading cadres, the tunneling workers tried every means to improve tunneling efficiency. The total footage in the first seven days exceeded the plan by 5.71%. The retreating workers also set indicators and measures every day, and conducted evaluations and inspections after work. In the first seven days, they also overfulfilled the state coal production plan by 27.21%.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 8th: Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau concentrated its efforts on strengthening mining and tunneling, and achieved a double harvest in retreat mining and tunneling. From August 1st to 4th, the average daily output of raw coal of the bureau increased by 20% compared with the average daily output in July, and the tunneling progress increased by 37%.

In late July, the Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau Party Committee transferred 1,400 laborers from basic construction and auxiliary workshops to strengthen mining and tunneling work. At the same time, it reduced the leadership organizations at the team level and extracted more than fifty team-level leading cadres to go down to the groups to take on leadership positions and participate in labor. As a result of these measures, the number of retreat mining faces in the entire mine increased from the original thirty-one to thirty-six, and the number of tunneling teams more than doubled. The mine also vigorously promoted the "604" coal loading machine created by Ximing Coal Mine for tunneling work to increase tunneling speed. In order to expand coal production capacity, the entire mine also newly opened three small coal kilns, with a daily output of more than 800 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 8th: In the first five days of August, the average daily output of raw coal at Hebi Coal Mine was 20,671 tons, an increase of 6.5% over the same period in July and an increase of 28.2% over the state plan. The tunneling footage increased by 34.5% compared to the same period in July.

Leading cadres at all levels of Hebi Coal Mine went deep into the front line to solve the key problems of production leap. Li Gangyi, deputy secretary of the Chenjiazhuang Mine Party Committee, went deep into the mine to focus on tunneling, adopting the method of "two tunneling to ensure one mining" (that is, two tunneling faces to ensure one coal mining face), which guaranteed the sustained leap in production. Due to the increase in tunneling and coal mining faces, the daily output of raw coal in Jiaochang Mine increased by more than 1,300 tons compared with July. The workers also enthusiastically launched competitions between mines, districts, and shifts. Luocun Mine, with an annual output of 600,000 tons of coal, which was put into production on June 1st this year, had miners transferred from other original mines. They found competitors in the mines where they originally worked and challenged each other. This new mine, which has been in production for only more than two months, averaged more than 2,200 tons of raw coal per day in the first five days of August, exceeding the design level by 10%.

    各级领导干部到第一线抓生产
    煤矿职工深入开展增产原煤竞赛	阜新煤矿
    新华社阜新8日电　阜新煤矿在超额完成7月份生产计划的基础上，8月头五天，全矿超额七百四十六吨完成了国家原煤生产计划；掘进超过国家计划25.8％，比7月份平均日进水平提高6.83％。
    为了确保煤炭高产，阜新煤矿在7月份就组织各矿最优秀的掘进队，进行了技术表演赛，使十一项先进技术搭配成套，迅速在各矿推广。
    8月份以来，各矿井下掘进队又开展了月进双千米的高速掘进竞赛运动。平安矿1至4日掘进一千五百一十八米，平均每日掘进三百八十米，比7月份平均月进度又提高了18.3％。各矿在大抓生产准备工作中，还对机电设备进行了全面检修，有力地保证了8月份煤炭持续高产。
    各级领导干部在增产原煤的运动中层层下放，全矿区有一千一百多名坑段长以上的干部在生产第一线安营扎寨。矿的党政领导机关搬到生产现场办公，坑口建立了井下办公室，部分矿党委书记、矿长和坑长，分别下放担任坑段长的领导工作，在生产第一线踏踏实实地解决问题。	开滦煤矿
    新华社天津8日电　开滦煤矿职工掀起了一个新的生产高潮。8月1日到5日煤炭的平均日产量比7月下旬提高2.44％。
    为了实现第三季度大幅度增产，各矿一进8月，就召开了职工代表会，互相挑战应战，开展“一顶几”竞赛运动。唐家庄矿水采三机职工，在竞赛中研究出一种新的生产办法，全区虽然抽出二十八名劳动力支援干港回采掘进，每天还超产五百多吨煤。在竞赛中，各矿还抽出了掘进能手任广进、李长亮和采煤闯将李柏堂等四十多名标兵，到各矿传播表演新技术。林西矿一○三三工作面通过传播表演，解决了煤壁“丢疙瘩”的问题，日产量由一千一百吨提高到一千七百吨。
    开滦煤矿的各矿党委书记、厂长、工程师深入生产第一线，切实地帮助解决生产上的薄弱环节问题。从7月底以来，由于煤的产量不断提高，运输能力不能适应生产需要。各矿领导干部就深入到运输部门，猛攻运输关。马家沟矿副矿长阎子清在跟班劳动中，和老工人一起研究，调整了绞煤时间，使井下出煤时间由原来六小时增加到七小时。	京西矿务局
    新华社8日讯　今年头七个月超额完成采煤和掘进计划的京西矿务局，8月前七天产量又有新的增长。全局原煤产量和掘进总进尺分别超过国家计划11.7％和2.99％，平均日产量和平均进尺都超过7月同期水平。
    进入8月份以后，京西矿务局的职工进一步展开了生产竞赛。大台煤矿领导干部和科室人员也到井下参加生产，指挥战斗。在领导干部亲自指挥下，掘进工人千方百计提高掘进效率，前七天总进尺比计划超过5.71％，回采工人每天订出指标措施，收工后就进行评比检查，前七天也超额27.21％完成了国家产煤计划。	太原西山矿务局
    新华社太原8日电　太原西山矿务局集中力量加强采掘，取得了回采掘进双丰收。8月份1日到4日，全局原煤平均日产量比7月份平均日产量增长了20％，掘进进度增加了37％。
    中共太原西山矿务局党委，在7月下旬从基本建设和辅助车间，抽调出一千四百个劳力，加强了采掘工作；同时，又减少了队一级的领导机构，抽出队级领导干部五十多人，下放到小组担任领导，参加劳动。由于采取了这些措施，全矿回采工作面由原来的三十一个增加到三十六个，掘进组比原来增加了一倍还多。这个矿还大力推广西铭煤矿创造的掘进工作使用的“六○四”装煤机，来提高掘进速度。为了扩大煤的生产能力，全矿又新开采了三个小煤窑，日产量可达八百多吨。	鹤壁煤矿
    新华社郑州8日电　鹤壁煤矿在8月的头五天平均日产原煤两万零六百七十一吨，比7月份同期提高6.5％，比国家计划增加28.2％，掘进进尺比7月份同期增长34.5％。
    鹤壁煤矿各级领导干部都深入第一线，解决生产跃进的关键问题。陈家庄矿党委副书记李刚毅，深入矿下狠抓掘进，采取“二掘保一采”（即两个掘进工作面保一个采煤工作面）的方法，保证了生产持续跃进。教场矿由于增加了掘进和采煤工作面，原煤日产量比7月份增加了一千三百多吨。职工们还热烈地展开了矿与矿、区与区、班与班的竞赛。今年6月1日才投入生产的年产六十万吨煤的罗村矿，矿工都是从其它原有矿井调来的。他们在原来工作的矿井找竞赛对手，互相挑战竞赛。这个投入生产仅有两个多月的新矿井，8月头五天平均日产原煤两千二百多吨，超过设计水平10％。
