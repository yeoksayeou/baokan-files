Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 5th: The Third Group of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Complete Disarmament Pre-Meeting passed its report on the evening of the 4th. The report presented an overview of the speeches made by nineteen representatives from Japan and other foreign countries at the group meeting.

The report pointed out that the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs, for complete disarmament, and for peaceful coexistence is a movement in which people from all walks of life participate. The struggle should be carried out from all aspects.

The report said that the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs in Japan has been strengthened due to the people's concern that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will lead to nuclear armament and the dispatch of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" overseas. The experience of the Japanese people's struggle tells us that the goals of the struggle should be determined based on a thorough analysis of the current situation, and the true goals must be explained to the people before the struggle can move forward.

The report pointed out that anyone who opposes atomic and hydrogen bombs and advocates peace is a comrade-in-arms in the struggle for peace. But this does not mean compromising with erroneous ideas among the people, let alone compromising with the forces of war.

The report said that in order to develop the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, international cooperation and exchange of opinions are very necessary. The peace marches in Aldermaston, England, sparked peace marches in Japan. The people's struggle in South Korea encouraged the struggle against the "Security Treaty" in Japan. The struggle in Japan has strengthened the struggle of people all over the world. In this regard, exchanging information through pamphlets on the peace movement published in various countries will greatly help to exchange experiences in the peace movements of various countries.

The report said that the work of the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs to provide relief to atomic bomb victims has been effective and will continue to do so.

The report also pointed out that it is extremely important for scientists participating in the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs to cooperate. In this regard, disseminating the materials obtained by doctors and scientists through their work and from Japanese atomic bomb victims is of great significance for strengthening the struggle against the use of nuclear weapons.

The report said that in order to strengthen the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs, it is recommended that a center for materials on atomic and hydrogen bombs be established in Tokyo to collect evidence on the dangers of atomic and hydrogen bombs to humanity and the true nature of nuclear armament. To this end, a movement to raise international funds is already underway. This center will certainly prove that it is of great value in explaining to the people the nature of militarism and nuclear weapons and the true purposes of the forces of war.

    第三分组通过报告
    动员各界人民参加和平运动
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会预备会议第三分组在4日晚上通过了报告。报告提出了十九位日本和其他外国的代表在分组会上所作的讲话的概述。
    报告指出，反对原子弹和氢弹、争取全面裁军和和平共处的运动是有各界人民参加的运动。应当从各方面展开斗争。
    报告说，日本反对原子弹和氢弹的运动，由于人民担心日美“安全条约”会导致核武装化和把日本“自卫队”派到海外去，而得到加强。日本人民斗争的经验告诉我们，斗争的目标应当根据对当前形势的彻底分析来决定，必须向人民解释真正的目标，然后斗争才能向前发展。
    报告指出，只要是反对原子弹和氢弹并主张和平的人，都是争取和平的战友。但是并不是说同人们中间的错误思想妥协，更不是同战争势力妥协。
    报告说，为了发展禁止原子弹和氢弹运动，国际合作和交换意见是非常必要的。英国阿尔德马斯顿的和平游行引起了日本的和平游行。南朝鲜的人民斗争鼓励了日本反对“安全条约”的斗争。日本的斗争又加强了全世界人民的斗争。在这方面，通过各个国家刊印的和平运动的小册子来交流情况，将大大有助于交流各国和平运动的经验。
    报告说，反对原子弹和氢弹运动救济原子弹受害者的工作已经有了成效，并将继续这样做。
    报告还指出，参加反对原子弹和氢弹运动的科学家进行合作，是极其重要的。在这方面，传播医生和科学家通过工作和日本原子弹受害者得到的材料，对于加强反对使用核武器的斗争，是具有重要意义的。
    报告说，为了加强反对原子弹和氢弹的运动，建议在东京设立关于原子弹和氢弹的材料中心，来收集关于原子弹和氢弹对人类的危险和核军备的真正性质的证据。为此目的，已经在进行筹集国际基金的运动。这个中心一定会证明，在向人民说明军国主义和核武器的性质和战争势力的真正目的方面，它是有重大价值的。
