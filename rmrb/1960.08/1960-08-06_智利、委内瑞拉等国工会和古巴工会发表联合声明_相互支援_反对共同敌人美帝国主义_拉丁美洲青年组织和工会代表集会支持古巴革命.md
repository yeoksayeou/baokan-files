Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 4th: Trade union representatives from Chile, Venezuela, Uruguay, and other Latin American countries, along with Cuban trade union representatives, who came to Havana to celebrate the July 26th Cuban Revolution Day and to attend the Latin American Youth Congress, jointly signed a statement firmly supporting the Cuban Revolution and calling on Latin American workers to support each other in the struggle. This statement was read out yesterday evening at a mass meeting held at the Havana Workers' Palace.

The statement emphasized that U.S. imperialism is the common and main enemy of the people of Latin American countries.

The statement pointed out that the Cuban Revolution is an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution for which the working class of Latin American countries has fought and should currently stand at the forefront of the struggle.

Referring to the U.S. conspiracy to use the Organization of American States to invade Cuba, the statement said that the people will mobilize unprecedentedly to crush plans to diplomatically isolate, economically retaliate against, or use so-called international police against Cuba. The statement emphasized, "We remind imperialism and its vassals that, contrary to the 'advice' they offer to Cuba, the Cuban people and the revolutionary government not only do not reject but accept and appreciate the voluntary and resolute support provided by the Soviet Union, People's China, and all socialist countries."

The statement said that Cuba's experience shows that the people of any of our countries will not be isolated as long as they are determined to fight for independence. We oppose the hypocritical lies fabricated about Soviet interference in Latin America, and we insist that the only danger existing on this continent is the rule of imperialism.

The statement emphasized that in Latin America, the righteous act of eliminating imperialist rule is legitimate.

The statement called on the workers and people of those Latin American countries to which the United States transferred sugar import quotas reduced from Cuba not to produce this sugar for the United States. The statement said that the representatives of all trade union organizations signing this statement decided to strengthen mutual support in the "struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, to defend national independence and social progress, to improve the living conditions of the masses, and to defend democracy and world peace."

The statement pointed out that in Latin American countries other than Cuba, the struggle for economic and democratic rights through strikes is developing rapidly. The statement suggested convening a congress of the Latin American trade union movement as soon as possible to establish a new, united, and singular Latin American unified trade union.

A mutual support agreement signed between the Cuban Workers' Confederation and the Chilean Workers' United Federation was also read out at the meeting. The agreement stated that Cuban and Chilean workers would expand joint actions against U.S. imperialist attacks, oppression, and threats. These two national central trade unions called on the workers of their countries to be especially vigilant regarding the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization of American States in order to thwart any attempt by imperialism to attack Cuba in any way. The agreement stated that Chilean workers declared their readiness to defend Cuba's sovereignty and independence with their blood.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 4th: Representatives from over two hundred youth organizations from Latin American countries participating in the First Latin American Youth Congress, as well as trade union leaders from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Bolivia, held an enthusiastic mass meeting at the Havana Workers' Palace yesterday evening. The attendees unanimously and solemnly swore to defend the Cuban Revolution and oppose U.S. imperialist aggression.

Raúl Castro, Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba, attended the meeting and spoke. This mass meeting was held by the Cuban Workers' Confederation to welcome youth representatives from Latin American countries.

As the attendees took their oath, they all stood up and chanted slogans such as "We will win" and "Down with U.S. imperialism" for a long time, cheering the Cuban Revolution. A huge banner was hung in the venue with the slogan: "The Americas, yes; Yankees, no." The mutual support agreement signed between the Chilean Workers' United Federation and the Cuban Workers' Confederation, and the joint statement of support for the Cuban Revolution by trade union representatives from Chile, Venezuela, Uruguay, and other Latin American countries were read out at the meeting. At the same time, the representative of Bolivian oil workers handed over an agreement supporting Cuba to the leaders of the Cuban Workers' Confederation.

Bernardo Araya Zulueta, President of the Chilean Workers' United Federation, said at the meeting, "We will always stand by your side in the struggle against U.S. imperialism, and all Latin American countries will advance together with Cuba."

Javier Larroca, leader of the Uruguayan Workers' United Federation, announced that the Uruguayan working class and the people of the country proposed a general strike on the day the Organization of American States convened its meeting of foreign ministers. His suggestion was met with enthusiastic response from the attendees.

Lindolfo Silva, leader of the Brazilian Agricultural Workers' Federation, Pérez Salinas, International Relations Secretary of the Venezuelan Workers' Confederation, Jorge Cassella, leader of the Argentine Trade Union Solidarity and Cooperation Movement, Francisco Márquez, representative of the Colombian Construction Workers' Federation, and other speakers all emphasized that the people of Latin American countries were determined to voluntarily take up arms and fight alongside the Cuban people against the common enemy – U.S. imperialism.

Former Guatemalan President Arbenz, who attended the meeting, addressed the assembly, saying, "The most vicious and blood-soaked enemy of the people of all countries in the world is U.S. imperialism." Arbenz condemned Guatemalan puppet President Idígoras for participating in the U.S. government's conspiracy against Cuba. He emphasized, "Cuba will not become another Guatemala." Arbenz's speech was warmly welcomed.

Raúl Castro, Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba, spoke last. He exposed the U.S. aggression plot against Cuba, saying, "There are two trends in Washington: on the one hand, directly attacking with the Pentagon's aggressive forces; on the other hand, adopting what the State Department experts call multifaceted actions against Cuba."

Regarding the upcoming meeting of the Organization of American States, Raúl Castro said that the role of this meeting of the Organization of American States was to defend U.S. imperialist aggression.

Raúl Castro said that Cuba would never abandon the principle of supporting just causes. He praised the Latin American Youth Congress as having particularly important significance. He also expressed support for the struggles of the people of Panama, Puerto Rico, and other countries for independence.

The Venezuelan construction workers and the Peruvian people's organizations sent telegrams to the conference to express their congratulations and support. Brazilian workers symbolically donated funds to purchase weapons and aircraft to defend Cuban sovereignty. Delegations from Chilean miners and Bolivian telecommunications workers also presented gifts to Raúl Castro and Cuban trade union leaders, demonstrating their fraternal friendship towards the Cuban people.

    新华社哈瓦那4日电　来哈瓦那参加庆祝7月26日古巴革命节以及参加拉丁美洲青年代表大会的智利、委内瑞拉、乌拉圭的全国性工会以及另外一些拉丁美洲国家工会的代表和古巴工会代表共同签署了一个联合声明，坚决支持古巴革命，并且号召拉丁美洲工人在斗争中相互支援。这个声明是昨天晚上在哈瓦那工人宫举行的群众大会上宣读的。
    这项声明强调指出，美帝国主义是拉丁美洲各国人民的共同的和主要的敌人。
    声明指出，古巴革命是反帝和反封建的革命，拉丁美洲各国工人阶级曾为此进行过斗争，目前也应该站在斗争的最前列。
    声明在谈到美国阴谋利用美洲国家组织侵略古巴的计划时说，人民将空前地动员起来，粉碎对古巴进行外交孤立、经济报复或者使用所谓国际警察的计划。声明强调指出，“我们提醒帝国主义及其附庸：同他们对古巴提出的‘劝告’相反，古巴人民和革命政府不但不拒绝而且接受并且感谢苏联、人民中国以及所有社会主义国家所提供的自愿的和坚决的支持。”
    声明说，古巴的经验表明，任何我们这些国家的人民只要他们决心争取独立，他们将不会是孤立的。我们反对捏造苏联干涉拉丁美洲的这种虚伪的谎言，我们坚持认为本大陆存在的唯一危险是帝国主义的统治。
    声明强调，在拉丁美洲，消灭帝国主义统治这一正当行为是合法的。
    声明号召那些美国把从古巴削减的食糖进口定额转让给它们的拉丁美洲国家的劳动者和人民不要为美国生产这些糖。声明说，签署这个声明的所有工会组织的代表，决定在“反对国内外敌人、保卫民族独立和社会进步、改善群众生活条件、保卫民主和世界和平的斗争中加强互相支援”。
    声明指出，除了古巴以外，在拉丁美洲的其余国家里，争取经济和民主权利的罢工斗争正在迅速地发展。声明建议尽速召开拉丁美洲工会运动的代表大会，以便建立一个新的团结的和唯一的拉丁美洲统一工会。
    在会上还宣读了古巴工人联合会和智利工人统一工会之间签订的互相支援协定。协定说，古巴和智利的工人将扩大反对美帝国主义攻击、压迫和威胁的共同行动。这两个全国性的中央工会号召他们国家的劳动者对即将召开的美洲国家组织外长会议特别提高警惕，以便使帝国主义用任何方式进攻古巴的企图不能得逞。协定说，智利工人宣布，他们准备以他们的鲜血保卫古巴的主权和独立。
    新华社哈瓦那4日电　参加拉丁美洲青年第一次代表大会的拉丁美洲国家二百多个青年组织的代表，以及阿根廷、巴西、智利、哥伦比亚、乌拉圭、委内瑞拉和玻利维亚的工会领袖，昨天晚上在哈瓦那的工人宫举行了热情澎湃的群众集会。与会者一致庄严地宣誓：保卫古巴革命，反对美帝国主义的侵略。
    古巴革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗出席了会议，并且在会上讲了话。这个群众集会是古巴工人联合会为欢迎拉丁美洲各国青年代表而举行的。
    当与会者宣誓时，全体一致起立，长时间地欢呼古巴革命，高呼“我们必胜”和“打倒美帝国主义”的口号。在会场上悬挂着巨大的横幅标语：“要美洲，不要美国佬”。会上宣读了智利工人统一工会和古巴工人联合会签署的互相支援的协定和智利、委内瑞拉、乌拉圭等拉丁美洲国家工会代表支持古巴革命的联合声明。同时，玻利维亚石油工人代表把支持古巴的协议交给了古巴工人联合会的领导人。
    智利工人统一工会主席布莱斯特在会上发表讲话说，“我们在反对美帝国主义的斗争中将永远站在你们一边，所有的拉丁美洲国家也将和古巴一起前进。”
    乌拉圭工人统一工会领导人哈维尔·拉罗卡宣布：乌拉圭工人阶级和全国人民建议在美洲国家组织召开外长会议的那天进行总罢工。他的这一建议受到了与会代表的热烈反应。
    巴西农业工人联合会领导人林多耳福·席尔瓦、委内瑞拉工人联合会国际关系书记佩雷兹·萨利纳斯、阿根廷工会团结合作运动领导人豪尔赫·卡塞利亚、哥伦比亚建筑工人联合会代表弗朗西斯科·马克斯以及其他发言的人都强调指出：拉丁美洲各国人民决心自愿拿起武器，同古巴人民一起战斗，反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义。
    出席会议的危地马拉前总统阿本斯向大会发表讲话说，“世界各国人民的最凶恶和血海深仇的敌人就是美帝国主义。”阿本斯谴责危地马拉傀儡总统伊迪戈拉斯参与美国政府反对古巴的阴谋。他强调指出，“古巴不会成为第二个危地马拉”。阿本斯的讲话受到热烈的欢迎。
    古巴革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗在最后讲了话。他揭露美国对古巴的侵略阴谋说，“华盛顿的两种趋势是：一方面利用五角大楼的侵略军直接进行攻击；另一方面采取国务院专家所说的对古巴进行多方面的行动。”
    劳尔·卡斯特罗在谈到即将召开的美洲国家组织的会议时说，美洲国家组织这次会议的作用是为美帝国主义的侵略进行辩护。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗说，古巴将永远不会放弃支持正义事业的原则。他赞扬拉丁美洲青年代表大会具有特别重要的意义。他还表示支持巴拿马、波多黎各等国人民争取独立的斗争。
    委内瑞拉建筑工人和秘鲁的人民团体都来电向大会表示祝贺和支持。巴西工人象征性地为购买保卫古巴主权的武器和飞机捐了款。智利矿工和玻利维亚电信工人代表团还向劳尔·卡斯特罗和古巴工会领导人赠礼，表现了对古巴人民的兄弟情谊。
