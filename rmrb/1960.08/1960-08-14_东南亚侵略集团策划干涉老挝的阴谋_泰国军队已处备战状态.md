Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: Member states of the Southeast Asia aggression bloc, controlled by the United States, are plotting a conspiracy to interfere in Laos.

According to Thai newspapers, Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat convened an emergency cabinet meeting immediately after the Revolutionary Committee in Laos launched a coup on the 9th. The meeting passed a resolution ordering the Thai army and border police on the Thai-Laotian border to be placed on "combat readiness," implementing "special alert status" in order to take action when necessary.

The report said that Thai police authorities have announced a temporary closure of the Thai-Laotian border. At the same time, they dispatched Nai Prachak, Commander of the Inland Police, and Nai Charn Ansuchote, Commander of the Border Police, to the Thai-Laotian border to conduct activities.

According to a United Press International report on August 12, Phoumi Nosavan, the defense minister of the Lao government of Chao Somsanith, known for being extremely pro-American, secretly returned to Laos after holding secret talks with Thai officials in Bangkok on the 10th. It is reported that he is gathering troops in southern Laos, preparing to take military action against Kong Le's forces.

It is also reported that U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, Johnson, held lengthy talks with relevant Thai parties on the Lao situation on the evening of the 9th. Following this, Pasis, a press officer of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, announced in Bangkok on the 12th that the council representatives of this aggression bloc would hold a meeting in Bangkok in August. He said that the aggression bloc "is carefully studying the Laotian situation, and it is expected that the meeting will pay close attention to developments in the [Laotian] situation."

As previously reported, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council held special meetings on the 9th and 10th to discuss the Laotian political situation. Military representatives from member states attended the meeting.
