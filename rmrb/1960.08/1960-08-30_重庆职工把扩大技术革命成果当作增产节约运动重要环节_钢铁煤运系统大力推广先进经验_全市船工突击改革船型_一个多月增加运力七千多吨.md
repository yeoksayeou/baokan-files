Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 29th: Chongqing workers, in the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, have launched a new upsurge of inspecting, summarizing, and promoting the achievements of the technical revolution.

Factory and mine enterprises throughout the city are treating the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of technical revolution achievements as an important part of carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement. Workers in factories and mines in the city's central district used the methods of extensive airing of views, big contending, and great debate to inspect and summarize the usage of innovation projects. More than 1,400 workers formed over 90 "Four Transformations" upgrade shock teams to improve projects that were not well-used or were not perfect. Recently, they have repaired and improved over 240 innovation projects that had not been put into production and put them into production; they have also made further improvements and enhancements to over 1,800 innovation projects that had already been implemented; and they have promoted over 220 new technologies and new processes. As a result, since August, the output and quality of products in factories throughout the district have significantly improved, and more than 2,000 workers have been saved.

In order to enable the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement to quickly achieve greater results, since August, the Chongqing steel, iron, coal, and transportation systems have held advanced experience exchange conferences to quickly exchange and promote advanced experiences that have the greatest and most universal significance for current production. Workers in each system are actively learning new technologies and new experiences created by advanced units. After learning the experience of the Baishi Station Iron Factory in Ba County for high-yield, high-quality, and low-consumption blast furnace production, the average daily output of pig iron in the county in the first half of August increased by 57.85% compared to July. After the Gailanxi Steel Plant introduced new technologies and experiences in converter high yield and alloy steel and high-quality carbon steel smelting at the citywide steelmaking advanced experience exchange conference, workers at converter plants throughout the city have generally learned from their experience over the past ten days. After the No. 3 Steel Plant promoted the experience of the Gailanxi Plant, the desulfurization rate increased to 70%.

According to Chongqing Daily News, a mass movement to reform ship types, increase transport capacity, and promote grain and steel production, characterized by "small boats topping big boats, old boats topping new boats, new boats being renewed daily, and one boat topping several boats," has been widely launched throughout Chongqing. From early July to mid-August, the city increased its transport capacity by more than 7,600 tons through ship type reform, promptly transporting large quantities of key materials. The Water Transport Company alone transported an additional 9,528 tons of coal, coke, pig iron, and other materials from August 1st to 19th.

In order to tap the potential of water transport, the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Communications launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on reforming ship types and increasing transport capacity last year, focusing on the Municipal Water Transport Company, and achieved a doubling of transport capacity. The experience of the Water Transport Company shows that reforming ship types requires less money, saves materials, uses less labor, is faster, and increases load capacity greatly, making it a good way to increase transport capacity in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. The Municipal Bureau of Communications promptly summarized the experience of this company, and in early July, it transferred more than ten outstanding carpenters, shipbuilders, and sailors to form an advanced experience promotion team for ship type reform, which went deep into the grassroots units of the Municipal Water Transport Company and various districts and counties to widely mobilize the masses, generally promote excellent ship types, and quickly launched a mass movement to reform ship types throughout the city. During the movement, the broad masses of workers racked their brains and painstakingly studied, inspecting materials, cutting materials, hammering iron nails, and planing boards themselves, racing against time, not even letting go of short periods of time such as when they were docked waiting to be loaded or unloaded. After more than forty days of effort, ship types such as Jiafang boats, butterfly boats, pontoon boats, and half-cabin boats have been promoted, with remarkable results. Generally, the carrying capacity has been increased by 20%-50%. In Beibei District, Qijiang, Changshou, and Ba County alone, in the twenty-odd days of July, transport capacity was increased by about 2,000 tons through ship type reform.

In the ship type reform movement, the Municipal Water Transport Company and the district and county transportation companies all assigned leading cadres to strengthen leadership, assigned tasks to groups, and mobilized shipbuilders to take action. Each unit also organized special forces such as ship type reform shock teams, formulated plans, launched campaigns, and implemented shock tactics. In a short ten-day campaign in mid-July, Ba County transformed nine small boats with a load capacity of only a few tons into pontoon, Jiafang, and butterfly boat types, increasing transport capacity by nearly 200 tons. After the workers of the Baimiao Station of the Municipal Water Transport Company carried out a crash program to greatly modify Jiafang boats, they increased transport capacity by 1,072 tons, achieving a doubling of transport capacity. In July, the monthly output per ton of ships exceeded 1,000 ton-kilometers, exceeding the production plan by 3.7%.

    重庆职工把扩大技术革命成果当作增产节约运动重要环节
    钢铁煤运系统大力推广先进经验
    全市船工突击改革船型　一个多月增加运力七千多吨
    据新华社重庆29日电　重庆市职工在增产节约运动中，掀起了检查、总结和推广技术革命成果的新高潮。
    全市厂矿企业都把技术革命成果的巩固、推广、提高工作，作为开展增产节约运动的重要环节。市中区各厂矿企业职工运用大鸣大放大辩论的方法，检查和总结了革新项目的使用情况，并由一千四百多个职工组成了九十多个“四化”升级突击队，将没有很好使用和不够完善的革新项目加以改进和提高。最近他们已经修复和改进了原来没有投入生产的二百四十多项革新项目，并投入了生产；对已经实现的一千八百多个革新项目也作了进一步改进和提高；还推广了新技术、新工艺二百二十多项。这样，使全区各厂8月份以来产品产量、质量都显著提高，并节约出劳动力二千多人。
    为了使增产节约运动迅速获得更大的成效，8月份以来，重庆市钢、铁、煤、运输系统都召开了先进经验交流大会，迅速交流和推广对当前生产收效最大的有普遍意义的先进经验。各系统的工人们都积极学习先进单位创造的新技术、新经验。巴县各铁厂的职工们学习了白市驿铁厂高炉高产优质低耗的经验后，全县8月份上半月生铁平均日产量比7月份猛增57.85％。溉澜溪钢厂在全市炼钢先进经验交流大会上，介绍了转炉高产和炼合金钢、优质炭素钢的新技术、新经验后，近十多天来，全市各转炉厂职工普遍学习了他们的经验。第三钢铁厂推广溉澜溪厂的经验以后，脱硫率提高到了70％。
    据重庆日报消息　一个“小船顶大船，旧船顶新船，新船日日新，一船顶数船”的改革船型，增加运力，促进粮、钢增产的群众运动，已在重庆全市普遍开展起来。自7月上旬起到8月中旬止，全市通过船型改革已增加运力七千六百多吨，及时运输了大批重点物资，仅水上运输公司8月1日至19日就多运煤焦、生铁及其他物资九千五百二十八吨。
    为了挖掘水运潜力，重庆市交通局去年就以市水上运输公司为重点，发动群众开展了以改革船型，增加运力为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，实现了运力加番。水上运输公司的经验表明：改革船型花钱少，用料省，用工不多，时间快，增加载量大，是多、快、好、省地增加运力的好办法。市交通局及时总结了这个公司的经验，并于7月初抽调优秀的水木工、船工十多人，成立了船型改革先进经验推广队，深入市水上运输公司基层单位和各区、县广泛发动群众，普遍推广优良船型，迅速在全市掀起了一个改革船型的群众运动。运动中，广大职工群策群力刻苦钻研，自己检料、下料、打铁钉、刨板子，争分夺秒，那怕停泊待装待卸等短暂时间也不放过。经过四十多天的努力，推广了加枋船、蝶式船、浮筒船、半舱船等船型，收效显著，一般都提高载运量20％—50％。仅北碚区、綦江、长寿、巴县在7月份的二十几天中，通过船型改革就增加运力两千吨左右。
    在船型改革运动中，市水上运输公司和区、县交通运输公司都抽出主要干部加强领导，把任务落实到小组，发动船工人人动手。各单位还组织了船型改革突击队等专门力量，订规划，搞战役，实行突击。巴县在7月中旬短短十天的战役中，就把九只载重仅几吨的小船改为浮筒、加枋、蝶式等船型，增加运力将近两百吨。市水上运输公司白庙站职工，经过突击，大改加枋船，增加运力一千零七十二吨，实现了运力加番，7月份船吨月产突破了千吨公里，超额3.7％完成了生产计划。
