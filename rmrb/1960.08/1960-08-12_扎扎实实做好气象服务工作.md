Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Meteorological Service
By People's Daily Commentator

Currently, it is a crucial period for the growth and development of autumn crops, and also a period when natural disasters such as drought, flood, wind, hail, and pests occur frequently and in a mixed manner. Field management work in summer, such as fertilization, weeding, irrigation, and intertillage, is closely related to meteorological conditions. Grasping the timing of the seasons, deeply understanding the nature of the soil, and applying fertilizer and pesticides at the right time can greatly improve fertilizer efficiency and insecticidal effects; predictions and forecasts of precipitation and soil moisture can provide a scientific basis for reservoir water storage and discharge, and field irrigation and drainage. In order to seize a bumper harvest this autumn, we must do a more thorough and meticulous job in meteorological services for agricultural production.

Familiarity with the characteristics of local agricultural production and strengthening investigation and research are the keys to carrying out in-depth and meticulous meteorological service work. The regional nature of agricultural production and the local nature of weather changes are very significant. Various crops are affected differently by meteorological conditions, and weather changes are also very complex, especially in summer. Even in the same village or the same city, weather changes can be very different due to differences in terrain, landforms, vegetation, and other conditions. The proverb "thunderstorms are only a cow's back away" vividly illustrates the complexity of weather changes. This requires meteorological workers to go deep into the front line of agricultural production, earnestly strengthen investigation and research work, become familiar with the specific circumstances of local agricultural production, understand the characteristics of local weather changes, and grasp what kind of weather conditions local major crops "need and fear." Only in this way can we achieve tailoring to the time, place, and crop, and carry out meteorological service work meticulously and solidly. During the wheat harvest season this year, the meteorological departments of Jiangsu Province dispatched meteorological stations, outposts, and groups at all levels to go deep into the front line of production. Based on the local weather and crop characteristics, combined with the needs of agricultural production, they focused on medium and short-term weather forecasts, which not only improved the accuracy of weather forecasts and did a good job in meteorological services, but also strengthened the guidance of local people-run meteorological outposts and groups, achieving multiple benefits in one fell swoop. This practice is very good and worthy of promotion.

The central issue in doing a good job in meteorological service is to fully mobilize the masses. Closely integrate the state-run meteorological service stations and the meteorological service stations with the people's commune and production brigade-run meteorological service outposts and groups, and implement a one-stop forecasting service system for stations, outposts, and groups. In their long-term struggle against natural disasters, Chinese farmers have accumulated extremely rich experience in "observing the sky, the land, and the crops," which is an extremely rich treasure trove. Seriously exploring this treasure trove will greatly improve the level of meteorological science in our country. To this end, we must mobilize the vast masses of local farmers, especially experienced veteran farmers, to participate in meteorological service work. The masses of farmers have grown up locally, know the seasons, and understand the advantages of the terrain; they are the local "Zhuge Liangs." We must rely closely on them, respectfully learn from them, and at the same time help the masses learn modern meteorology knowledge, so that meteorological service work can truly meet the needs of local agricultural production.

Continuously improving the accuracy of weather forecasts and correctly mastering and using forecasts are important links in doing a good job in meteorological services. At present, the accuracy of weather forecasts has improved significantly compared with the past, but due to the limitations of people's understanding of the objective world, it is not possible to fully grasp the laws of natural changes and achieve 100% accuracy. In this case, to effectively do a good job in meteorological services, on the one hand, we must continue to earnestly implement the principle of "combining large, medium, and small weather forecasts," summarize the farmers' experience in observing the sky, summarize the successful and failed experiences and lessons of forecasting, strengthen scientific research, and further understand the objective laws of weather changes, so that weather forecasts are as close as possible to or consistent with objective reality. On the other hand, the departments using weather forecasts should flexibly grasp and specifically apply them according to the local conditions at the time, and implement the spirit of "prevention first, two sets of arrangements" and "planning for the worst and striving for the best." In this way, we can build our forecasting service work on a solid and reliable foundation.

    扎扎实实做好气象服务工作
    本报评论员
    当前，是大秋作物生长发育的关键时期，也是旱、涝、风、雹、虫等自然灾害出现频繁、交错发生的时期。夏季的田间管理工作，施肥、除草、排灌、中耕等农业技术措施和气象条件有着密切的关系。掌握天时，深知土性，适时施肥和喷撒农药，可以大大提高肥效和灭虫的效果；降水和土壤湿度的预测预报，可以为水库的蓄水泄水、田间排灌提供科学的依据。为了夺取今年秋季大丰收，必须更加深入、细致地做好气象为农业生产服务的工作。
    熟悉当地农业生产的特点，加强调查研究工作，是深入、细致地开展气象服务工作的关键。农业生产的区域性和天气变化的地方性很显著。各种农作物受气象条件的影响各不相同，天气的变化也十分复杂，特别是夏季，即使在同一个乡村，同一个城市，由于地形、地貌、植被等情况的不同，天气变化就会很不一样。“雷雨隔牛背”的农谚十分形象地说明了天气变化的复杂性。这就要求气象工作人员深入到农业生产第一线，切实地加强调查研究工作，熟悉当地农业生产的具体情况，摸清当地天气变化的特点，掌握当地主要农作物“要什么天气，怕什么天气”。这样，才能做到因时、因地、因作物制宜，细致、扎实地开展气象服务工作。江苏省气象部门在今年麦收期间，层层派出了气象台、站、组，深入生产第一线，根据当地的天气和农作物的特点，结合农业生产的需要，狠抓中、短期天气预报，既提高了预报天气的准确率，做好了气象服务工作，又加强了对当地民办气象哨、组的指导，一举数得。这种做法很好，值得提倡。
    做好气象服务工作的中心问题是充分发动群众。把国家办的气象服务台和气象服务站和人民公社、生产大队自办的气象服务哨、组密切地结合起来，实行台、站、哨、组预报服务工作一条龙。我国农民在长期与自然灾害作斗争中，积累了极其丰富的“看天、看地、看庄稼”的经验，这是一个极其丰富的宝库，认真地发掘这个宝库，将会大大提高我国气象科学的水平。为此，我们要发动当地的广大农民群众，特别是生产经验极其丰富的老农参加气象服务工作。农民群众在当地土生土长，知天时，识地利，他们是当地的“诸葛亮”。我们必须紧紧依靠他们，恭恭敬敬地向他们学习，同时帮助群众学习现代气象学知识，才能使气象服务工作真正符合当地农业生产的需要。
    不断提高天气预报的准确率，正确地掌握和使用预报，这是做好气象服务工作的重要环节。当前，天气预报的准确率比过去有了显著的提高，但是，由于人们对客观世界认识的限制，还不能完全掌握自然变化的规律，做到百分之百的准确。在这种情况下，要切实做好气象服务工作，一方面必须继续认真贯彻“天气预报大中小相结合”的方针，总结农民的看天经验，总结预报成功和失败的经验教训，加强科学研究，进一步认识天气变化的客观规律，使天气预报尽量接近或符合于客观实际。另一方面，使用天气预报的部门要根据当时当地的情况，灵活掌握，具体应用，要贯彻“防字当先，两套安排”、“从最坏处打算，向最好处努力”的精神。这样，我们就可以把预报服务工作建立在切实可靠的基础之上。
