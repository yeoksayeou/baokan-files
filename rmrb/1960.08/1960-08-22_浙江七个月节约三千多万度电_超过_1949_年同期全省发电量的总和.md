    Zhejiang Saves Over 30 Million Kilowatt-Hours of Electricity in Seven Months
    Exceeding the Total Provincial Power Generation in the Same Period of 1949
    (Our dispatch from Hangzhou, August 21) Various regions of Zhejiang Province have promoted advanced experiences in saving electricity, achieving great results.
    According to statistics from Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Huzhou, Jinhua, Shaoxing, and Jiaxing, over 33 million kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved in the first seven months of this year, exceeding the total provincial power generation in the same period of 1949. In Hangzhou, industries such as metallurgy, chemical, machinery, paper making, textile, food, and building materials have promoted over 200 experiences in saving electricity, saving a total of over 19 million kilowatt-hours in half a year without affecting production.
    Party committees at all levels attach great importance to electricity conservation. Each city and most factories have set up electricity conservation offices, extensively carrying out publicity and education on saving electricity, making electricity conservation well-known and deeply rooted in people's hearts. Shaoxing formed an electricity conservation work group, specifically helping the Shaoxing Magnetic Factory summarize the advanced experience of adjusting motors and using electricity rationally. After that, they immediately promoted it, allowing the factory's experience to quickly blossom and bear fruit throughout the county.
    In the mass movement of saving electricity, factories and enterprises have all taken reducing the unit power consumption of industrial products as the main direction. In Hangzhou alone, more than 820 large motors being used for small tasks were adjusted in the first half of the year, reducing excess capacity by more than 5,900 kilowatts. In the textile industry, equipment has been improved, which has not only reduced the load on the machines but also generally reduced power consumption.

    浙江七个月节约三千多万度电
    超过1949年同期全省发电量的总和
    本报杭州21日电　浙江省各地推广先进的节约用电经验，取得很大成绩。
    据杭州、宁波、温州、湖州、金华、绍兴和嘉兴等市的统计，今年前七个月共节约用电三千三百多万度，超过了1949年同期全省发电量的总和。杭州市冶金、化工、机械、造纸、纺织、食品、建筑材料等行业，推广了二百多项节约用电经验，在不影响生产的情况下，半年之内共节约用电一千九百多万度。
    各级党委十分重视节电工作。各市及大部分工厂都抽调干部成立了节电办公室，广泛开展节约用电的宣传教育，使节约用电家喻户晓，深入人心。绍兴组成节电工作组，具体帮助绍兴磁厂总结了调整马达、合理用电的先进经验以后，立即推广，使这个厂的经验迅速在全县开花结果。
    在节约用电的群众运动中，各工厂企业都把降低工业产品单位耗电量作为主攻方向。单杭州市上半年就调整大材小用电动机八百二十多只，压缩了多余容量五千九百多瓦。纺织工业中改进了装置，既减轻了机器负荷，又普遍降低了电耗。
