Imperialist aggressive forces stubbornly refuse to reduce armaments, refuse to ban the use and production of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and refuse to reach an agreement on immediately stopping the testing of such weapons. They continue the so-called "Cold War," engage in an arms race, establish more and more military bases, implement aggressive policies that undermine peace, and create the danger of a new war.

    帝国主义侵略势力顽固地拒绝裁减军备，拒绝禁止使用和生产原子武器和氢武器，拒绝就立刻停止试验这种武器达成协议。他们继续所谓“冷战”，进行军备竞赛，建立越来越多的军事基地，实行破坏和平的侵略政策，造成新战争的危险。
