Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 9th: Representatives from Asian, African, and Latin American countries attending the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Complete Disarmament told reporters on the 7th and 8th that they support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people against the new Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, emphasized the importance of mutual support among the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries in the struggle for national independence, and expressed their support for Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal for Asian and Pacific countries to conclude a peace pact and establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.

Mrs. Theja Gunawardhana, the representative from Ceylon, said that the people of Ceylon support the struggle of the Japanese people against the security treaty, military bases, and nuclear weapons, and that the struggle of the Japanese people also inspires the peace movement in Ceylon. She emphasized that the struggles of the people of all countries in the world support each other, and only by forming a united front can the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America overthrow the colonialists.

She said that the people of Ceylon, with the support of the Chinese people, had freed themselves from the economic control of imperialism, and she believed that the Japanese people, who are in struggle, will certainly be able to free themselves from the control of U.S. imperialism with the support of the Chinese people and the people of Asian and African countries.

She said that Premier Zhou's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia and the Pacific reflects the common demands of our Asian people. It is a touchstone for true peace and false peace, and all those who truly desire peace should accept this proposal. When talking about the U.S. imperialists' tricks of playing false peace, she said that the people should expose the U.S. imperialists' false peace tactics at any time.

Ibrahim Isa, the representative from Indonesia, said: The political consciousness of the Japanese people is constantly improving. They correctly recognize that the struggle for peace and the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" are inseparable.

He said that the struggle of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance is supported by the people of all countries.

He said that the high morale of the Japanese people's million-strong peace march as it converged in Tokyo clearly proves that this struggle is supported by the entire Japanese people.

He said that he was moved by the Japanese people's struggle for peace, which is full of confidence and perseverance.

He said that the United States not only interferes in Japan but also interferes in Indonesia's internal affairs. For example, in 1958, during the rebellion in Sumatra, the U.S. military even wanted to land in Pekanbaru to support the rebels.

He emphasized that Premier Zhou's initiative to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia and the Pacific fully conforms to the Bandung Principles. All the people of Asia and the Pacific region will support this initiative because it is beneficial to the people of all countries.

Mansur Gilani, the representative from India, pointed out that the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism has inspired the people of the world, especially the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries. He said: This anti-American struggle has made the Indian people more aware of the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism.

He said that Premier Zhou's proposal is also a matter of utmost concern to all Asian people. He pointed out that the U.S. and Pakistan military alliance treaty threatens India.

Manuel Venturili, the representative from Chile, said that this peace conference is of extremely important international significance. The anti-American struggle experience of the Japanese people is very helpful to the people of Asian and Latin American countries, because they are all fighting against U.S. imperialism, and the struggle of the Japanese people has set a model for them. He said that the struggle of the Japanese people greatly inspires the struggle of the Latin American people and also supports the anti-American struggle of Cuba.

Mrs. Rosa Castro, the representative from Mexico, said that recently many "points" of opposition to U.S. imperialism have appeared all over the world, of which Cuba is one point, and Japan is also a point. The struggle of the Cuban people tells us that no matter how small a country is, it can fight against U.S. imperialism; the struggle of the Japanese people tells us that even the President of the United States can be prevented from carrying out activities in Japan.

She also pointed out the important significance of Premier Zhou's peace initiative for world peace, especially for peace in the Pacific region.

Oginga Odinga, the representative from Kenya, said that the Japanese people's struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a great cause, and it is an important part of this world conference against imperialism, colonialism, and militarism. He said that he participated in this world conference and in the Japanese people's peace march, and actually carried out the anti-imperialist struggle together with the Japanese people.

He said that it is a good thing that the Chinese people support the Asian-African national liberation movement. Asian and African countries should support each other.

He said that Premier Zhou's proposal is a very important and great proposal, and the major countries in the world should support this proposal.

He said that the United States is only talking about peace, and it can be seen at many international conferences that the United States always expresses opposing opinions on the issue of disarmament.

    参加世界大会的亚非和拉丁美洲国家代表指出
    周总理的倡议对世界和平意义重大
    强调各国人民在反帝斗争中团结一致相互支持
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：参加第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的亚非和拉丁美洲国家的代表在7日和8日先后对记者谈到，他们支持日本人民反对新日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争，强调亚非和拉丁美洲各国人民在争取民族独立斗争中相互支持的重要性，并且表示支持周恩来总理关于亚洲和太平洋各国缔结和平公约并在这个地区建立无核武器地区的建议。
    锡兰代表特加·古纳瓦达纳夫人说，锡兰人民支持日本人民反对安全条约、军事基地和核武器的斗争，日本人民的斗争同时也鼓舞了锡兰的和平运动。她强调说，世界各国人民的斗争都在互相支持，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民只有结成统一战线，才能把殖民主义者反掉。
    她说，锡兰人民过去由于中国人民的支持，摆脱帝国主义的经济控制，她表示相信斗争中的日本人民在中国人民和亚非各国人民的支持下也一定能够摆脱美帝国主义的控制。
    她说，周总理的关于在亚洲和太平洋建立无核武器地区的建议反映了我们亚洲人民的共同要求。它是真和平与假和平的试金石，凡是真正要求和平的人，都应当接受这项建议。在谈到美帝国主义玩弄假和平的手段时，她说，人民应当随时揭露美帝国主义的假和平手法。
    印度尼西亚代表易卜拉欣·伊萨说：日本人民的政治觉悟正在不断提高。他们正确地认识到，争取和平的斗争和反对日美“安全条约”的斗争是分不开的。
    他说，日本人民反对日美军事同盟的斗争受到各国人民的支持。
    他说，日本人民万里和平大游行队伍在东京会师时的士气昂扬的情况清楚地证明，这个斗争受到全体日本人民的支持。
    他说，他为日本人民充满信心和毅力为争取和平而进行的斗争所感动。
    他说，美国不仅干涉日本同时也干涉印度尼西亚内政。例如1958年在苏门答腊发生叛乱事件时美军竟要登陆北干巴鲁，支援叛乱分子。
    他强调说，周总理关于建立亚洲和太平洋无核武器地区的倡议完全符合万隆原则。全体亚洲和太平洋地区人民都会支持这项倡议。因为它对于各国人民有利。
    印度代表曼苏尔·吉拉尼指出，日本人民反对美帝国主义的英勇斗争鼓舞了世界人民，特别是亚非和拉丁美洲各国人民的斗争。他说：这种反美斗争使印度人民更加认识到美帝国主义的侵略本质。
    他说，周总理的建议也是所有亚洲各国人民最关心的问题。他指出，美国和巴基斯坦的军事同盟条约使印度受到威胁。
    智利代表万徒勒里说，这次和平大会具有极重要的国际意义。日本人民的反美斗争经验对亚洲及拉丁美洲各国人民是很有帮助的，因为他们都在为反对美帝国主义进行着斗争，而日本人民的斗争给他们起了模范作用。他说，日本人民的斗争大大地鼓舞了拉丁美洲人民的斗争，也声援了古巴的反美斗争。
    墨西哥代表罗萨·卡斯特罗夫人说，最近在世界各地出现了许多反对美帝国主义的“点”，其中古巴是一个点，日本也是一个点。古巴人民的斗争告诉我们，无论怎样小的国家也能够同美帝国主义进行斗争；日本人民的斗争告诉我们，即使对美国总统也能阻止他到日本活动。
    她还指出周总理的和平倡议对世界和平、特别是太平洋地区和平的重要意义。
    怯尼亚代表奥金加·奥廷加说，日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争是一个伟大的事业，它是这次世界大会反对帝国主义、殖民主义和军国主义的重要部分。他说，他参加了这次世界大会，参加了日本人民的和平大游行，实际上是和日本人民共同进行了反帝斗争。
    他说，中国人民支持亚非民族解放运动是件很好的事情。亚非各国都应当相互支援。
    他说，周总理的建议是个很重要的、很伟大的建议，世界上的大国应该支持这项建议。
    他说，美国只是空谈和平，在不少国际会议上可以看到美国对裁军问题总是表示相反的意见。
