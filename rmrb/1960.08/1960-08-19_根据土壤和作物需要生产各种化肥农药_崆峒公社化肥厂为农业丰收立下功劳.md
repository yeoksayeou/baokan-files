Producing various fertilizers and pesticides according to soil and crop needs
Kongtong Commune Fertilizer Plant contributes to agricultural bumper harvest
    (Our newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch on the 18th) The Kongtong People's Commune Fertilizer Plant in Pingliang City, Gansu Province, fully utilizes the characteristics of community-run industries that are native, closely linked to reality, and conscientiously conducts research and investigation. Based on the different needs of various soils, crops, and seasons, it produces various fertilizers and pesticides, powerfully supporting agricultural production.
    Under the unified leadership of the commune, they adopted a method combining mass general survey and professional testing to conduct investigations and research on the soil, crops, growth period, and the laws of natural disasters such as diseases, insects, frost, and hail in all twelve brigades of the commune. They produced various fertilizers according to different needs. For example, they found that the soil alkalinity of Liuhu, Jingtan, Tianmen, and Tuba Brigades along the Jing River was high, requiring acidic fertilizers; the soil in Yangzizhai, Baofeng, and Tuanjie Brigades in the river valley was mostly neutral, suitable for all kinds of fertilizers; the 45,000 mu of wheat sown throughout the commune required more nitrogen fertilizer; during the crop growth period, armyworms, wheat red spiders, mantis oothecae, vegetable soft-bodied insects, wheat rust, and corn smut often occurred here, requiring the supply of various pesticides according to the season.
    Referring to the results of the investigation, the factory implemented the spirit of "planning first, production first, supply first" to formulate a production plan, started early, and produced a large number of fertilizers and pesticides. In the first quarter, the bacterial fertilizer workshop produced 458 tons of bacterial fertilizer, mainly phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, to prepare sufficient base fertilizer for spring sowing and autumn fields. The fertilizer workshop produced 698 tons of quick-acting nitrogen fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate for winter wheat warming seedlings, returning to green, tillering, and jointing topdressing. The pesticide workshop produced 19 tons of dual-purpose pesticides for spring plowing soil disinfection, and more than 28 tons of ferrous sulfate and *Veratrum* powder for preventing wheat red spiders, mantis oothecae, and vegetable soft-bodied insects. Starting in March, as agriculture entered the busy season of spring plowing and summer planting, the fertilizer plant promptly switched to preparing quick-acting topdressing for autumn fields. To meet the needs of autumn field jointing and wheat filling, in the second quarter, it produced more than 1,400 tons of fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate, bone meal, superphosphate, and phosphate powder. It produced more than 6,400 frost-prevention smoke bombs to prevent frost, more than two tons of gunpowder to prevent hail, and 57 tons of pesticides to support the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests in various teams. Since June, the fertilizer workshop has concentrated its efforts on producing defluorinated phosphate fertilizer and superphosphate with more phosphorus and potassium to promote autumn field filling. The bacterial fertilizer workshop has now prepared more than 820 tons of nitrogen-fixing bacterial fertilizer for winter wheat sowing.
    When supplying fertilizer to each team, the factory adapted to the soil characteristics and transportation conditions of each team. Liuhu, Tuba, Tianmen, and Jingtan Brigades, which are close to the city and have sufficient household fertilizer, were only supplied with a certain amount of acidic quick-acting fertilizer as topdressing. Baofeng, Tuanjie, and Yangzizhai Brigades, which lacked fertilizer but had convenient transportation, were supplied with a large amount of base fertilizer and topdressing. In the first half of the year, more than 1,220 tons of neutral and slightly acidic bacterial fertilizer and chemical fertilizer have been supplied. The West Mountain, Beitong, Gangou, Hanjagou, and Yaergou teams in the mountainous area, which lacked fertilizer the most and relied only on human and animal transport, were specially produced high-quality bacterial powder (only half a jin per mu), and technicians were also sent to these brigades to help establish local chemical fertilizer plants and produce a large amount of local chemical fertilizer on the spot.
    The Kongtong Commune Fertilizer Plant, by adhering to the principles of obtaining materials locally, using indigenous methods for production, and running the factory diligently and thriftily, has continuously innovated technology. The 33 types of chemical fertilizer, bacterial fertilizer, and pesticides produced are of high quality and low cost, and are widely welcomed by the commune members. In the first half of this year, the factory with 98 employees supported agriculture with more than 1,900 tons of fertilizer and pesticides, with an average application of 38 jin per mu on the commune's 100,000 mu of cultivated land. According to a survey by Yangzizhai Brigade, wheat with chemical fertilizer yielded 50 jin more per mu. After the summer harvest, many commune members said: This year's wheat harvest was a success, and our fertilizer factory should be credited!

### 根据土壤和作物需要生产各种化肥农药  崆峒公社化肥厂为农业丰收立下功劳

    根据土壤和作物需要生产各种化肥农药
    崆峒公社化肥厂为农业丰收立下功劳
    本报兰州18日电　甘肃平凉市崆峒人民公社化肥厂充分发挥社办工业土生土长、密切联系实际的特点，踏踏实实作好调查研究工作，根据各种土壤、作物和各个季节的不同需要，生产各种化肥和农药，有力地支援了农业生产。
    他们在公社统一领导下，采取群众普查和专业化验相结合的办法，对全社十二个大队的土壤、作物、生长期和病、虫、霜、雹等自然灾害的规律进行了调查研究，根据不同需要生产各种化肥。例如，摸清泾河沿岸的柳湖、泾滩、天门、土坝大队的土壤碱性大，需要酸性肥料；川区的养子寨、宝丰、团结大队的土壤多是中性，各种肥料都适宜；全社播种的四万五千亩小麦需氮肥多；作物生长期间，这里常发生粘虫、麦红蜘蛛、螵虫和蔬菜软体虫、小麦锈病、玉米灰包病，需按季节供应各种农药。
    这个厂参照调查结果，贯彻计划在前、生产在前、供应在前的精神制定了生产计划，及早动手，大量生产各种化肥、农药。第一季度，细菌肥料车间以磷、钾肥为主生产细菌肥料四百五十八吨，给春播秋田准备足了底肥。化肥车间生产硝酸铵等速效氮肥六百九十八吨，供冬小麦暖苗、返青、分蘖、拔节期追肥施用。农药车间为春耕土壤消毒生产了十九吨两用农药，为预防麦红蜘蛛、螵虫、蔬菜软体虫生产了二十八吨多硫酸亚铁和狼毒粉。从3月开始，农业进入春耕夏种大忙时期，化肥厂又及早转入为秋田准备速效追肥的生产。适应秋田拔节、小麦灌浆的需要，第二季度生产了硝酸铵、骨粉、过磷酸钙、磷粉等化肥一千四百多吨。为防霜生产了防霜烟幕弹六千四百多个，为防冰雹生产了二吨多火药，还生产了五十七吨农药，支援各队防治病虫害。6月以来，化肥车间集中力量突击生产含磷钾较多的脱氟磷肥、过磷酸钙等，促进秋田灌浆。菌肥车间，现已为冬小麦播种准备固氮菌肥八百二十多吨。
    工厂在供应各队肥料时，都适应了各队的土壤特点和交通情况。柳湖、土坝、天门、泾滩大队，靠近城市，农家肥料充足，就只供应一定数量的酸性速效化肥作追肥。宝丰、团结、养子寨大队，肥料不足，但交通便利，就大量供应底肥和追肥。上半年已供应中性、微酸性的菌肥、化肥一千二百二十多吨。山区的西山、北峒、甘沟、韩家沟、鸭儿沟等队，肥料最缺乏，又只靠人背畜驮运输，工厂就给这类地区特别生产了优质菌粉（一亩只用半市斤），同时还派技工到这几个大队帮助建立起了土化肥厂，就地大量生产土化肥。
    崆峒公社化肥厂由于坚持了就地取材、土法生产、勤俭办厂的方针，不断革新技术，生产的三十三种化肥、菌肥、农药，都做到了优质低成本，受到了社员的普遍欢迎。今年上半年这个九十八名职工的工厂，共支援农业化肥、农药一千九百多吨，全社十万亩耕地，每亩平均施用三十八斤。据养子寨大队调查，施用化肥的小麦，每亩多打了五十斤。夏季丰收以后，许多社员说：今年小麦丰收，功劳簿上应该给咱化肥厂记上一笔！
