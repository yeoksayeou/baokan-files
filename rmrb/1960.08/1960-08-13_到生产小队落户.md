    Settling Down in Production Teams
    Hu Hanmin, Secretary of the Party Committee of Bahe Commune, Xishui, Hubei

    Since this spring, we moved the commune office from the market town to the countryside, settling down in the production teams, living with the commune members, and further strengthening our ties with the masses. The commune office is located in ordinary people's houses, with commune members as neighbors, no different from them. In front of the commune is a highway, where commune members come and go, often stopping by the commune office to rest, drink water, chat, and laugh, as close as family, without any estrangement. Outside the highway is the production team's field, and commune cadres, whenever they have time, carry a hoe to the field and work with the commune members. Behind is the production team's mess hall, where commune cadres eat with the commune members after work. The commune members praised this practice of the commune cadres, saying, "Cadres and commune members eat in the same mess hall, discuss matters together in meetings, and are equally busy in production." The commune cadres also feel that moving the office to the production team has many advantages, saying, "Going out the front door, you see production; going out the back door, you see life; and when you rest, you chat with the commune members, which is much more convenient than living in an office in the market town."

    The massification of the commune office does indeed have many benefits. Cadres truly live with the commune members as ordinary laborers, receiving better training in ideology and emotion, and effectively overcoming bureaucracy and subjectivism. In April this year, according to information obtained by the commune by telephone, the base fertilizer for early rice in the entire commune was basically sufficient. So, a field meeting was held to mobilize the large-scale transplanting of early rice. The next day, as we were plowing the fields with the commune members, a poor peasant commune member said to us, "Some fields do not have enough fertilizer. Transplanting like this, I am afraid that we will transplant a lot of seedlings but harvest little grain." After listening to the commune member's opinion, we immediately went to check with the production team cadres and found that in one production team, out of eight hundred mu of early rice fields, more than one hundred and twenty mu of distant fields had not been fertilized or had not been fertilized sufficiently. At this time, the county party committee also called and instructed us to rush fertilizer for a few days and transplant rice after the fertilizer was sufficient. According to the instructions of the county party committee and the situation found in the inspection, we changed the plan in time, and the entire commune launched a large-scale green manure campaign. Cadres took the lead in going to the lake, leading more than one hundred commune members, working hard for seven days, and collecting more than 30 million catties of green manure. This year, the entire commune had a bumper harvest of more than 50,000 mu of early rice. When the commune members talked about it, they recalled the green manure campaign last year, saying, "This year's early rice harvest is thanks to the great effort in collecting green manure those few days." This incident made us deeply realize that without going deep among the masses and without going deep into the production site, many problems are not easily understood in time and cannot be solved quickly. The high speed of the Great Leap Forward, with its rapidly changing circumstances, requires the commune's command organization to have a high degree of sensitivity and combat effectiveness. If the commune office does not go deep into the production site, it cannot grasp the "bottom line" of the movement in time, cannot grasp new problems, and cannot better adapt to the new situation.

    Leading production is like this, and leading life is even more so. Only by participating in the public mess hall like participating in production, and eating in the mess hall, can we run the mess hall well. On the first day that the commune office moved to the team, we went to the team's mess hall to help the cooks prepare meals and immediately discovered the problem of insufficient firewood. Sometimes, we had to wait for the firewood to burn, which affected the meal time and delayed production. So, the commune cadres and production team cadres personally took action, leading the commune members to dig up tree roots and chop firewood, and at the same time urged the commercial departments to transport coal. With this specific grasp, the problem of firewood was solved. This incident again deeply educated us: After collectivization of life, it is not enough to only grasp production and not life, and it is required to grasp it very carefully and specifically, not at all carelessly. Cadres participating in the mess hall and running the mess hall has now become a common practice. All eight management areas in the commune do not start their own kitchens separately and all share the mess hall with the production team. Cadres also regularly personally go to the kitchen to work as cooks, and the mess hall is run even better. By personally running the mess hall, cadres have gradually learned to comprehensively lead the mass life centered on the mess hall, taking life as the top priority in grasping production, and grasping life has powerfully promoted production.

    With the commune office moving to the team and settling down, some cadres from various departments have also gone deep into the forefront of production. Some people were originally worried that "diving headlong into agriculture would affect departmental work." After living there for a period of time, this concern gradually dissipated. Comrades in the departments realized from countless facts that departmental work cannot be done well without going deep into the production team to grasp the work of their own departments. Going deep into the production team does not affect the development of the work of various departments, but promotes the better service of various departments to agricultural production and better completion of the department's work tasks.

    In the past, although we were also in the countryside, we spent a considerable amount of time busy going up and down. Although we also "shared three things" with the commune members, we did not "share" when we came back. When assigning some work, we often pulled the cadres back to the office for meetings, saying more but showing fewer actual models, and there were more and longer empty meetings. Now, with the office in the team, being in the countryside, there is no such thing as "going to the countryside." Necessary meetings are held either in the fields or in the mess hall. Meetings must have a field site, letting the facts and models speak for themselves, which has a greater effect. With fewer meetings, cadres have more time to participate in production, go deep into reality, strengthen learning, and improve their ideological and work levels faster.

    A tower of ten thousand zhang rises from the ground. The victory of any work depends on our truly and concretely solving one specific problem after another. Where should we go to solve specific problems? We should go deep into the production team! The production team is the most direct, most concrete, and most basic organizational unit of production and life in the people's commune. The quality of the team's work has a great impact on production and life. The new situation requires our work to be more meticulous and concrete, that is, to go deep into the production team and help the team cadres do a good job in production and life. Doing a good job in team work is not irrelevant to the overall situation and easy to do. After learning, we overcame the idea of temporary settlement and promoted the further transformation of the cadre's work style. The entire commune achieved a bumper harvest in both the summer and early rice seasons, and the area of double-cropping rice was doubled compared to last year. With bumper harvests in every season, the morale of the commune members is high, and the work style of the cadres is more in-depth, solid, and concrete. Cadres and commune members are of one mind and one heart, and the countryside presents a thriving scene.

    到生产小队落户
    中共湖北浠水巴河公社委员会书记　胡汉民
    从今年春天起，我们把公社机关从集镇搬到了农村，在生产小队落户，和社员生活在一起，更加密切了和群众的联系。公社机关住在普通的民房里，左右邻舍都是住的社员，和社员没有什么两样。公社的前面是一条公路，社员来来往往，上上下下，经常到公社办公的地方来歇歇脚，喝喝水，聊聊天，谈谈笑笑，亲如家人，毫无隔阂。公路外边就是生产队的田畈，公社干部一有空，就扛把锄头下田，和社员一起生产。后面是生产小队的食堂，公社干部劳动后就和社员在一个食堂吃饭。社员们赞扬公社干部的这种作法说：“干部和社员，吃饭同食堂，开会同商量，生产一样忙。”公社干部也感到机关搬到生产小队，好处很多，说：“出大门看到了生产，出后门看到了生活，休息时和社员谈了心，比住在集镇上的机关里方便得多。”
    公社机关群众化，好处的确很多。干部真正做到以一个普通劳动者和社员生活在一起，在思想感情上得到了更好的锻炼，有效地克服了官僚主义和主观主义。今年4月间，公社从电话里了解的情况，全公社的早稻底肥基本办足，于是召开了现场会，动员早稻大插秧。第二天，我们和社员一起盘田，有个贫农社员对我们说：“有些田肥料不足，这样插下去，就怕插的秧多，收的谷不多。”听了社员的意见，我们立即和生产队的干部去检查，发现有个生产队八百亩早稻田，有一百二十多亩远田没有下肥或下得不足。这时，县委也打来电话指示我们要突击几天肥料，把肥料下足再插秧。根据县委的指示和下面检查的情况，我们及时改变了计划，全公社开展了一个大打青肥运动，干部带头下湖，带领一百多社员，大战七天，打青肥三千多万斤。今年全公社五万多亩早稻大丰收，社员们一谈起来，就回忆到上年打青肥的事，说：“今年的早稻丰收，那几天打的青肥得了大力。”这一件事情，使我们深深地体会到：不深入群众，不深入生产现场，很多问题就不容易及时了解，也就不能很快地解决。大跃进的高速度，情况的发展瞬息万变，要求公社的指挥机关有高度的敏感性和战斗性。公社机关如不深入生产现场，就不能及时地掌握到运动的“底”，抓不住新问题，就不能更好地适应新形势。
    领导生产是这样，领导生活更是这样。只有像参加生产那样，参加公共食堂，吃食堂，才能办好食堂。公社机关搬到小队的第一天，我们就到小队食堂去帮助炊事员弄饭，立即发现了烧柴不够的问题，有时等着柴烧，影响了开饭的时间，耽误了生产。于是公社干部和生产队干部，亲自动手，带领社员挖树根，砍柴禾，并一面督促商业部门运煤。这样具体一抓，烧柴的问题得到了解决。这件事又深深地教育了我们：生活集体化以后，只抓生产不抓生活不行了，而且要求抓得十分细致具体，一点粗枝大叶不得。干部参加食堂，办食堂，现在已经形成了一种风气，全公社八个管理区都没有单独起伙，一律和生产小队共食堂。干部还定期地亲自到厨房当炊事员，食堂办得更好了。干部通过亲自办食堂，逐步学会了全面的领导好以食堂为中心的群众生活，把生活当做抓好生产的头一条，抓好生活，有力地促进了生产。
    公社机关搬到小队落户，一部分部门的干部也随着深入了生产第一线。有些人原来顾虑“一头栽到农业上，影响了部门工作”。住了一段时期以后，这种顾虑也逐步打消了。部门工作的同志从无数的事实中体会到：不深入到生产队去抓本部门的工作，部门工作是抓不好的。深入生产队，其结果不是影响了各个部门工作的开展，而是促进了各部门更好地为农业生产服务，更好地完成了部门的工作任务。
    过去我们虽也是在农村，但有相当一部分时间忙于上上下下。虽也和社员同吃、同住、同劳动，但下去就“三同”，回来就不“同”了。布置个什么工作，往往把干部扯回机关开会，说得多一些，实际典型少一些，空泛的会议也就多了长了。现在，机关在小队，身在农村，无所谓“下乡”的问题。必要开的会，不是在田畈里开，就是在食堂里开。开会必有现场，让事实典型说话，所起的作用更大了。会议少了，干部有更多的时间参加生产，深入实际，加强学习，思想水平和工作水平提高得更快了。
    万丈高楼从地起。任何工作的胜利，都有赖于我们切切实实地解决一个一个的具体问题。到什么地方去解决具体问题呢？应当深入到生产小队去！生产小队是人民公社生产、生活最直接、最具体、最基层的组织单位。小队工作的好坏，对生产、生活有很大的影响。新形势要求我们的工作要做得更加细致、具体，就是要深入到生产小队去，帮助小队干部把生产、生活搞好。搞好小队工作，并不是无关大体、轻而易举的。经过学习以后，我们克服了临时落户的思想，促进了干部作风的进一步转变。全公社获得夏季和早稻两季大丰收，二季稻的面积又比去年扩大了一倍。生产季季丰收，社员情绪高涨，干部作风更加深入扎实和具体。干部社员一条心、一股劲，农村里呈现了一片欣欣向荣的景象。
