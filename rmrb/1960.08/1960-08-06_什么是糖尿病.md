    What is Diabetes	Fu Lianzhang
    When you put some starchy food (such as rice, steamed bread, etc.) in your mouth and chew it repeatedly, you will feel a sweet taste in your mouth after a while. This is because the starch has begun to be digested into some kind of sugar substance. Everyone also knows that starch can be made into sugar by artificial methods. That fermentation process is very similar to the digestive function in the human body. In short, starch is a macromolecular substance composed of many simple small-molecule sugars. Only when it is digested into the simplest small-molecule sugars can it be absorbed into the body to participate in metabolic changes. And the main one of these simplest sugar substances is glucose.
    After nutrients enter the human body, some are used to form the structure of the human body, and some are used for burning (or oxidation). In the burning process, a lot of energy (heat energy and chemical energy) can be generated to supply the needs of various parts of the body. Sugar, fat, and protein can all be burned, and sugar is the most important fuel, so people always use starchy foods as their staple food.
    Glucose is absorbed in the intestines and first enters the blood. Blood is a transfer line. Part of the sugar will be transferred to various parts of the body for burning, and another part will be sent to the liver to become liver starch and stored. It can also be converted into fat and stored in fat depots for continuous use. Therefore, the glucose in the blood is always maintained at a certain concentration, about eighty to one hundred and twenty milligrams of sugar per hundred milliliters of blood. If sugar metabolism is impaired for some reason, after glucose enters the blood, it is neither easily burned in the tissues nor easily converted into liver starch for storage, and a large amount remains in the blood. At this time, the concentration of sugar in the blood will increase. When the blood sugar concentration exceeds 160 to 180 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood, the sugar in the blood will be largely excreted into the urine through the kidneys. The long-term occurrence of this symptom constitutes a "diabetes".
    The cause of diabetes is generally believed to be due to an absolute or relative insufficient supply of an endocrine called insulin. Because insulin happens to have the effect of promoting glucose combustion, liver starch production, thereby lowering blood sugar and eliminating glycosuria. However, diabetes should not be regarded as a simple disease of sugar metabolism disorder, but should be regarded as a systemic disease, but with sugar metabolism disorder as the main manifestation. Therefore, the cause must also be sought from the human body as a whole. The metabolism of our human body is regulated by the nervous system and many endocrine factors. These many regulatory factors depend on each other and restrict each other, with nervous regulation as the leading factor. Admittedly, from the phenomenon, the factors that constitute diabetes may be mainly insulin disorders, but it is by no means the only aspect. Obviously, the entire metabolic regulation system has been紊乱 (wěnluàn - disordered/chaotic).
    The classic works of traditional Chinese medicine have long put forward: "People who are sweetly fat are prone to suffer from wasting-thirst", "Emotional tension leads to wasting and yellowing", these are very valuable insights. Diabetes is more common in people over forty years old, and it occurs more often in obese people than in non-obese people. After middle age, the entire metabolic system has some changes. If physical activity is insufficient, obesity is likely to occur. General obesity is not important, but an excessively obese body increases the burden on the metabolic structure, which may lead to some metabolic disorders.
    The treatment of diabetes in Western medicine advocates controlling diet, using insulin preparations when necessary, and preventing the occurrence of complications. I would like to emphasize that we should also pay attention to the treatment methods of traditional Chinese medicine, because this is a treasure house of thousands of years of rich experience. Recently, some hospitals have actively studied Chairman Mao's works, boldly innovated under the guidance of correct thinking, and adopted a comprehensive treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine for diabetes, achieving the effect of treating chronic diseases quickly. This is a very important victory and we should work harder to move forward.
    I would also like to talk about the necessity of increasing physical activity, which is important for preventing many diseases, especially some diseases related to metabolic disorders such as diabetes and arteriosclerosis, because increasing physical activity and doing some physical exercises suitable for the body can eliminate mental fatigue, promote metabolism, prevent obesity and the occurrence of some diseases. For people who already have diabetes, doing some suitable exercises under the guidance of a doctor will also have beneficial effects.

    什么是糖尿病	傅连暲
    当你把一些淀粉类的食物（如米饭、馒头等）放在口内反复咀嚼，久之就会感到口中有一种甜味，这是由于淀粉开始被消化成为某种糖类物质的结果。大家也都知道淀粉是可以经过人工方法制成糖的，那种发酵过程与人体内的消化作用是很相类似的。总之淀粉就是由许多最简单的小分子的糖所组成的一种大分子的物质，只有把它消化成为最简单的小分子的糖，才能被吸收到身体内去参与新陈代谢的变化。而这些最简单的糖类物质中主要的一种就是葡萄糖。
    营养物质进入到人体以后，有些被用来组成人体的结构，有些则用来燃烧（或者称为氧化），在燃烧过程中可以产生许多能量（热能和化学能），以供给身体各个部分活动的需要。糖、脂肪、蛋白质都可以燃烧，而糖又是一种最主要的燃料，所以人总是用淀粉类作为主食的。
    葡萄糖在肠子内吸收，首先进入血内，血液是一个转运线，糖的一部分将被转送到身体各部分去燃烧，另一部分则被送到肝脏变成肝淀粉而储存起来，还可以转化为脂肪而存在脂肪仓库内以备陆续取用。因此血液内的葡萄糖总是维持在一定的浓度上，大约每一百毫升的血内含有八十至一百二十毫克的糖。倘因某种原因引起糖的代谢障碍，葡萄糖进入血液后，既不易在组织内燃烧，又不易转变为肝淀粉而储存，大量的停留在血液内，这时血液内糖的浓度就要升高了。当血糖浓度超过每百毫升血内一百六十至一百八十毫克以上，这时血内的糖就要大量地经过肾脏排泄到尿里去，较长期地出现这种病状就构成一种“糖尿病”。
    糖尿病发生的原因，通常认为是由于一种名叫胰岛素的内分泌绝对地或相对地供应不足所引起的。因为胰岛素恰恰具有促进葡萄糖燃烧、肝淀粉生成，从而降低血糖消除糖尿的作用。但是糖尿病并不能认为是一个单纯的糖代谢障碍的疾病，而应该认为是全身性的疾病，不过是以糖的代谢障碍为主要表现，因此寻找它的病因也必须从人的整体出发。我们人体的新陈代谢是受着神经系统和许多内分泌素共同调节的；这许多调节因素之间，又是互相依赖，互为制约，而以神经调节为主导。诚然，从现象上看，构成糖尿病的因素可能以胰岛素障碍为主要方面，但决不是唯一的方面，显然是整个代谢调节体系都发生了紊乱。
    祖国医学的经典著作中很早就提出过：“甘美肥胖，易患消渴”，“情绪紧张，引致消瘅”，这都是非常宝贵的见解。糖尿病多见于四十岁以上的人，而肥胖的人比不肥胖的人发生的又要多些。人过中年，整个新陈代谢的体系都有些变化，如再加上体力活动不够就容易发生肥胖，一般的肥胖还无关重要，但过度肥胖的身躯就加重了新陈代谢结构的负担，这就有可能导致某种代谢障碍的疾病。
    西医对于糖尿病的治疗，是主张控制饮食，必要时使用胰岛素制剂，和预防并发症的发生。我想着重提出，也要重视中医的治疗方法，因为这是积累了几千年丰富经验的宝库。近来有些医院，积极钻研毛主席著作，在正确思想指导下，大胆革新，对糖尿病采取了中医西医的综合疗法，收到慢病快治的效果，这是一个非常重要的胜利，应该更加努力前进。
    还要说说增加体力活动的必要性，这对于预防许多疾病都是重要的，尤其像糖尿病、动脉硬化这样一些与新陈代谢障碍有关的疾病，因为增加体力活动，作些适合身体条件的体育锻炼，就能消除精神疲劳、增进新陈代谢、预防肥胖和一些疾病的发生，对于已经患有糖尿病的人，在医生的指导下，作些相宜的体操，同样会收到有益的效果。
