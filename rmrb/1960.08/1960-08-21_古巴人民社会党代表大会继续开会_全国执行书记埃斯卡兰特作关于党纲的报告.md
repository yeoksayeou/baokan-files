Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 18th. The Eighth National Congress of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba continued its session today. National Executive Secretary Aníbal Escalante delivered a report on the Party Program at the meeting.

    At today's meeting, nine delegates spoke on the report by General Secretary Blas Roca. Roca concluded his general report on the work of the Party on the morning of the 17th. At the afternoon session on the 17th, eight delegates spoke on Roca's report.

    Representatives of fraternal parties from the German Democratic Republic, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, and North Korea delivered congratulatory messages at today's meeting, and they were warmly welcomed by the delegates of the Congress.

    At the afternoon session on the 17th, the Congress read aloud, amidst warm applause, congratulatory telegrams from the Communist Parties of the Soviet Union, Albania, Austria, Australia, Burma, Belgium, and Ceylon.

    In his report to the Congress today, Escalante pointed out that this revolutionary stage is one of national liberation, land reform, the destruction of semi-colonial shackles, and the elimination of feudal remnants; it is the precursor to the stage of establishing, primarily and decisively, production relations based on the collective ownership of the means of production. He said that this Party Program "conforms to the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, and is primarily an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal program." He pointed out that the main points of the Party Program are: to achieve complete national liberation; to implement land reform; to develop industry and the entire national economy; and to raise the cultural and living standards of the people.

    He said that the program stipulates some basic guiding ideologies for the development of the economy, which are: the revolutionary state plays a major and decisive role in organizing production and general economic development; the state sector surpasses the private sector; the state formulates national economic plans.

    Escalante said that the Party Program cannot fail to foresee fundamental changes in the state's political organization, based on the nature of the revolution and its profundity.

    Escalante said, "Those who can complete the tasks of national liberation and land revolution cannot but be the entire proletariat and peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie, and even the national bourgeoisie. These classes and their interests are more or less promoting the revolution." Escalante emphasized, "The proletariat—the standard-bearer of socialism—cannot but be the revolutionary force in the pre-socialist stage." He said that the Party's strategy for the revolution is to "unite the masses through the united front of revolutionary classes who demand the revolution which constitutes the overwhelming majority of the national population to struggle against the main enemy, imperialism and its running dogs." The reporter said, "Due to the development of the revolution, the national bourgeoisie—as well as some members of the upper strata of the urban petty bourgeoisie and rich peasants who are with the national bourgeoisie—have begun to waver. Many people tend towards fear, regression, and attempts to contain the revolution." Escalante said, "We maintain the strategy of class alliance that was put forward at the beginning of the revolution. We strive to keep the national bourgeoisie in the revolutionary camp, although we certainly cannot make concessions that are detrimental to the development of the revolution." Escalante said, referring to the development of the revolution, that an important part of industrial production has become state-owned production. "Cuba no longer has feudal remnants." "The economic structure has begun to change, and has changed to a large extent." "The superstructure is also developing forward, although progress in this area will naturally lag somewhat behind."

    He pointed out that it can be concluded with “revolutionary conclusion: only cooperation and socialism can pave the way for satisfying the needs of the vast majority of people in the country and their desire for happiness."

    He asked, "Where is Cuba going?" He said that Cuba's direction of development is to thoroughly complete the tasks of striving for liberation, industrialization, and carrying out reforms, which will advance our country in all aspects, such as the economy, technology, and education, and enable our country to enter a higher and more progressive new social state.

    He said, "The role of the workers and the people's forces in the revolutionary process and the firm revolutionary leadership headed by Fidel Castro are factors in this development and transformation." "We fully recognize the decisive role of the working class in the new society and the responsibilities of the Marxist-Leninist vanguard of the mass movement."

    The reporter said, "Today, this program is not socialist, but we who believe in socialism tell the masses that the logical development of the revolution will lead to socialism, and the socialist stage will inevitably follow as that stage arrives."

    Escalante concluded by saying that this program is a decisive contribution of Marxism-Leninism to the Cuban people's struggle for independence, freedom, and progress. Our program is not only ours, but belongs to all the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 19th. The Eighth National Congress of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba continued to be held today. Manuel Luzardo, a member of the National Executive Bureau of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba, delivered a report on the revision of the Party Constitution at today's meeting. Six delegates spoke.

    Wu Xiuquan, representative of the Communist Party of China and member of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a congratulatory speech at today's meeting and read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Wu Xiuquan's speech was interrupted by warm applause several times. When he mentioned the name of Mao Zedong, all the delegates stood up and applauded. As Wu Xiuquan finished his speech, the delegates sang "The East is Red" in Chinese and shouted: Long live the Chinese people!

    The representatives of the fraternal parties of Costa Rica, Colombia, Czechoslovakia, Chile, Ecuador and France also delivered congratulatory speeches at today's meeting.

    The meeting passed a congratulatory telegram to Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, amidst warm applause, congratulating the Soviet Union on the successful launch of the second spaceship.

    古巴人民社会党代表大会继续开会
    全国执行书记埃斯卡兰特作关于党纲的报告
    新华社哈瓦那18日电　古巴人民社会党第八次全国代表大会今天继续开会。全国执行书记阿尼瓦耳·埃斯卡兰特在会上作了关于党纲的报告。
    在今天的会议上，有九位代表就总书记布拉斯·罗加的报告发了言。罗加在17日上午结束了关于党的工作的总报告。在17日下午会议上，有八位代表就罗加报告发了言。
    德意志民主共和国、阿根廷、玻利维亚、巴西、保加利亚、加拿大和朝鲜的兄弟党的代表在今天的会上致祝词，他们受到了大会代表的热烈欢迎。
    在17日下午会议上，大会在热烈掌声中宣读了苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、奥地利、澳大利亚、缅甸、比利时和锡兰共产党的贺电。
    埃斯卡兰特在今天向大会所作的报告中指出，这个革命阶段是民族解放、土地改革、摧毁半殖民地的羁绊和消灭封建残余的阶段，是主要地和决定性地建立以生产资料集体所有制为基础的生产关系的阶段的先导。他说，这个党纲“是符合反帝国主义和反封建的革命的纲领，并且主要是反帝国主义和反封建的纲领”。他指出，党纲的主要之点是：取得完全的民族解放；实行土地改革；发展工业和整个国民经济；提高文化和人民生活水平。
    他说，纲领中规定了发展经济的一些基本指导思想，这就是：革命的国家在组织生产和一般经济发展中起主要的和决定性的作用；国家部分超过私人部分；国家制定国民经济计划。
    埃斯卡兰特说，党纲不能不根据革命的性质及其深刻性预见到国家政治组织中的根本变革。
    埃斯卡兰特说，“完成民族解放和土地革命的任务的不能不是整个无产阶级和农民、城市小资产阶级、以至民族资产阶级。这些阶级及其利益都或多或少地推动着革命。”埃斯卡兰特强调指出，“无产阶级——社会主义的旗手不能不是社会主义以前的阶段的革命动力。”他说，党为革命提出的战略是，“通过占国家人口绝大多数的要求革命的阶级的统一战线来团结群众进行反对主要敌人帝国主义及其走狗的斗争”。报告人说，“由于革命的发展，民族资产阶级——以及和民族资产阶级在一起的城市小资产阶级上层和富农中的某些分子——已经开始发生动摇。有不少人趋向于恐惧、倒退和企图遏止革命。”埃斯卡兰特说，“我们保持在革命开始时就提出来的阶级联盟的战略。我们力争民族资产阶级留在革命营垒中，虽然我们当然不能做有害于革命发展的让步。”埃斯卡兰特在谈到革命的发展时说，工业生产中的一个重要部分已经成了国有生产。“古巴已经没有封建残余了”。“经济结构已经开始改变，并且已经在很大程度上发生了改变”。“上层建筑方面也在向前发展，虽然这方面的进展在某些地方自然会落后些”。
    他指出，可以得出“革命的结论：只有合作化、社会主义才能为满足全国绝大多数群众的需要和他们对幸福的渴望开辟道路”。
    他问道，“古巴向何处去？”他说，古巴的发展方向是彻底完成争取解放、工业化和进行改革的任务，这些改革在经济、技术、教育等一切方面使我国向前发展，使我国进入一个更高级、更进步的新的社会状态。
    他说，“工人和人民力量在革命过程中所起的作用和以菲德尔·卡斯特罗为首的坚定的革命领导是这个发展和转变中的因素”。“我们充分地认识到了工人阶级在新社会中的决定性作用以及群众运动的马克思列宁主义先锋队的职责”。
    报告人说，“今天这个纲领并不是社会主义的，但是我们信仰社会主义的人对群众说，革命的合乎逻辑的发展将导致社会主义，随着这个阶段到来的必将是社会主义阶段。”
    埃斯卡兰特最后说，这个纲领是马克思列宁主义对古巴人民争取独立、自由和进步的斗争的有决定意义的贡献。我们的纲领不仅仅是我们的，而且是属于全体人民的。
    新华社哈瓦那19日电　古巴人民社会党第八次全国代表大会今天继续举行会议。古巴人民社会党全国执行局委员曼努埃尔·卢萨多在今天的会上作了关于修改党章的报告。六位代表发了言。
    中国共产党代表、中共中央委员伍修权在今天的会议上致祝词，并且宣读了中国共产党中央委员会的贺电。伍修权的发言几次被热烈的掌声所打断。当他提到毛泽东的名字的时候，所有代表都起立鼓掌。在伍修权结束他的发言时，代表们用中文唱“东方红”，并且高呼：中国人民万岁！
    在今天的会议上致祝词的，还有哥斯达黎加、哥伦比亚、捷克斯洛伐克、智利、厄瓜多尔和法国的兄弟党的代表。
    会议在热烈的掌声中通过了致苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫的贺电，祝贺苏联成功地发射第二个宇宙飞船。
