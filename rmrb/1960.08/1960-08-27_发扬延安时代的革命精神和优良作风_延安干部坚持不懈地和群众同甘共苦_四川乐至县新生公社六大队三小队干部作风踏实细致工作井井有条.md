Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 26th: The Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has mobilized cadres at all levels to summarize the gains and experiences of adhering to the principle of sharing weal and woe with the masses and hard work over the past few years, further improve cadres' thinking, and improve work style, which has powerfully promoted current production.

Since the beginning of summer this year, during the busiest season of production, the entire prefecture has transferred more than 1,200 outstanding cadres to work in backward areas, and 80% of the cadres have gone deep into the grassroots and the front line of production. At the same time, under the specific leadership of the Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, all counties have held five-level cadre meetings to mobilize cadres to summarize the gains and experiences of adhering to the principle of sharing weal and woe with the masses and hard work over the past few years, and using typical figures and events, and using recall and comparison methods, profoundly educated the cadres, making the vast number of cadres further realize the important significance of promoting the revolutionary spirit and fine traditions of the Yan'an era. Party organizations in various communes and production teams have also generally adopted this method to educate cadres and the masses.

The vast number of cadres and masses in the Yan'an area have powerfully promoted various tasks in the entire prefecture because they have maintained and carried forward the revolutionary spirit and fine traditions of the most difficult years of the Chinese revolution. The industrial and agricultural production of the entire region is one of the regions in Shaanxi Province with the largest leap forward.

Going deep into the grassroots, and eating, living, working, and discussing with the masses has become a habit and a consciously observed system for cadres at all levels in the Yan'an Prefecture. Cadres throughout the prefecture generally have three or more farm tools, and participate in production wherever they go, working and working at the same time. From January to July this year, the 65 Party secretaries and commissioners of the prefectural committee, county Party secretaries, and county heads in the entire region worked an average of 95 days at the grassroots level, of which 53 were able to work, averaging 40 days each, and solved many work problems while producing. Grassroots cadres participated in labor for even more time. The 27 full-time cadres of the Fengzhuang Commune in Yan'an County worked an average of 129 and a half days each from January to July this year, while also doing various tasks well, making this commune a famous red banner unit in the Yan'an area. Hao Shucai, an old Red Army soldier who joined the army during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War and a famous special-class labor hero in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, retired in 1954 and served as the deputy secretary of the general Party branch of the Second Management Area of the Jiaokou Commune in Yan'an County. Although he is 57 years old, he still insists on working, and worked 210 workdays from January to July this year. Under his leadership, this management area, which was originally short of food, has struggled for two years, and each person has an average of 1,000 jin of grain.

Various tasks throughout the region have implemented the policy of diligence and thrift in running all undertakings. In the process of building the Yan-Hui Canal in Yan'an County, a large number of materials such as cement and gunpowder were needed. In the spirit of self-reliance, they established their own cement plant after more than 20 experiments, and successively produced more than 600 tons of cement, which was used by themselves and supported other construction units. The Yichuan County Health School had nothing when it was established in March last year, but they did not ask the state for a penny, and mobilized teachers and staff to engage in a large-scale production campaign during their work and study time, running a bacterial fertilizer plant, collecting mountain products and specialties, and cutting firewood, producing a total of more than 85,000 yuan, raising enough money to purchase bed boards and various teaching equipment, and also solving the problems of students' food, vegetables, and clothing. Currently, they still have a savings of 43,700 yuan. The students in this school also have very good academic performance, with those who have excellent grades in all subjects accounting for 83.4% of the total number of students.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 26th: The Third Team of the Sixth Brigade of the Xinsheng People's Commune in Tongjia District, Lezhi County, Sichuan Province, has well-organized production and various tasks due to the down-to-earth style of the cadres and meticulous work.

The number of people in this team who regularly participate in field labor accounts for 84.8% of the total labor force. The sown area of ​​major spring crops in this team this year increased by 29.3% compared with last year. At present, various crops have generally achieved no weeds, no insects, and no third-class seedlings.

Zeng Qihua, the leader of this team, is a pacesetter captain and a five-good cadre in the commune. The team committee of the team has a high prestige among the masses. They have both collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility; both temporary division of responsibilities and fixed division of responsibilities; both taking care of points and not relaxing the surface, and everything is done very tightly. For every major task, the captain personally goes to the masses to explore experience, propose a plan, and after the team committee studies it, submits it to the masses for discussion and approval before execution. Therefore, every task of theirs can be completed smoothly.

Adhering to long-term plans and short-term arrangements, so that the entire work is connected from beginning to end, and linked closely, is the main characteristic of the team's work. The long-term plan is to determine the work items according to the central tasks arranged by the commune and brigade for five days, and then according to the actual situation of the team. The short-term arrangement is to arrange work every day according to the work situation and new problems discovered temporarily.

In order to arrange labor more reasonably, team leader Zeng Qihua, in addition to focusing on going deep into a work group to take the lead in labor, also conducts inspections of overall work in a circular manner. Therefore, he is very familiar with the specialties of each member of the team. In this way, he can appropriately arrange work according to each person's physical strength and technical level, so as to make the best use of their talents and make the best use of them.

In order to make the quotas for various tasks fit the actual situation, cadres often take the lead in working with members to explore experience and formulate reasonable quotas. For example, the Party branch proposed one mu for planting corn, but the test results showed that only six or seven points could be completed, and it was later decided to change it to seven points; the original quota for digging sweet potato ridges was four points, but after testing, it was revised to five points, making the quota both advanced and feasible.

After the team implemented these methods, the members were very enthusiastic about production. 72% of the male members and 47% of the female members in the team are often commended. The trend of learning from advanced, catching up with advanced, surpassing advanced, and helping backward has become a common practice, thereby promoting the continuous leap forward in the team's production and work.

    发扬延安时代的革命精神和优良作风
    延安干部坚持不懈地和群众同甘共苦
    四川乐至县新生公社六大队三小队干部作风踏实细致工作井井有条
    据新华社西安26日电　中共延安地委发动各级干部总结几年来坚持和群众同甘共苦、艰苦奋斗的收获和经验，进一步提高干部思想，改进工作作风，有力地推动了当前的生产。
    今年入夏以来在生产最繁忙的季节，全专区抽调一千二百多个优秀干部到后进地区工作、80％的干部深入基层和生产第一线。同时，在中共延安地委的具体领导下，各县都召开了五级干部会议，发动干部总结了几年来坚持和群众同甘共苦、艰苦奋斗的收获和经验，用典型人物和事例，用回忆对比的方法，深刻地教育了干部，使广大干部进一步认识了发扬延安时代的革命精神和优良作风的重要意义。各公社、生产队的党组织，也普遍采用这种办法，教育干部和群众。
    延安地区的广大干部、群众由于保持和发扬了在中国革命最困难的年代的革命精神和优良传统，有力地推动了全专区各项工作。全区工农业生产是陕西省跃进幅度最大的地区之一。
    深入基层，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，已经成为延安专区各级干部的习惯和自觉遵守的制度。全专区干部一般都有三件以上的农具，走到哪里就在哪里参加生产，边生产，边工作。今年1月到7月，全区地委书记、专员、县委书记、县长六十五人，平均每人在基层工作了九十五天，其中能劳动的五十三人，平均每人劳动了四十天，并在生产的同时解决了很多工作问题。基层干部参加劳动的时间就更多了。延安县冯庄公社的二十七个脱产干部，今年1月到7月，平均每人劳动一百二十九天半，同时又做好了各项工作，使这个公社成为延安地区有名的红旗单位。第二次国内革命战争时参军的老红军、著名的陕甘宁边区特等劳动英雄郝树才，1954年退休后担任了延安县交口公社第二管理区党总支副书记。他虽然五十七岁了，仍然坚持劳动，今年1到7月做了二百一十个劳动日。这个原来缺粮的管理区，在他的领导下，奋斗了两年，每人平均有粮千斤。
    全区各项工作贯彻了勤俭办一切事业的方针。延安县在兴修延惠渠的工程中，需要大量的水泥、火药等器材，他们本着自力更生的精神，经过二十多次试验，自己办起水泥厂，先后生产了六百多吨水泥，除自用外还支援了其他基建单位。宜川县卫生学校，去年3月成立时一无所有，但他们没有向国家要一块钱，发动教职员工利用工作、学习以外的时间大搞生产运动，办细菌肥料厂，采集山货特产，打柴，共生产八万五千多元，筹齐了购置床板和各种教学设备的费用，还解决了学生的吃粮、吃菜、穿衣等问题，目前还节存四万三千七百多元。这个学校学生的学习成绩也很好，各门功课成绩优良者占到学生总人数的83.4％。
   据新华社成都26日电　四川省乐至县童家区新生人民公社六大队三小队，由于干部作风踏实、工作细致，使生产和各项工作井井有条。
    这个队经常参加田间劳动的人数，占总劳动力的84.8％。这个小队今年大春作物播种面积比去年扩大了29.3％。目前各种作物普遍实现了无草、无虫、无三类苗。
    这个小队的队长曾启华，是公社的标兵队长和五好干部。小队的队委会，在群众中有很高威信。他们既有集体领导，又有分工负责；既有临时的分片包干，还有固定的分线负责；既照顾点，又不放松面，样样工作都抓得很紧。每项重大工作，队长都亲自到群众中去摸索经验，提出方案，经队委会研究后，再交群众讨论通过执行。因此，他们的每一项工作都能顺利地完成。
    坚持长计划、短安排，使整个工作前后衔接，环环扣紧，是这个小队工作的主要特点。长计划是按照公社、大队五天布置的中心任务，再根据本队实际情况，确定工作项目。短安排是根据工作情况和临时发现的新问题，天天安排活路。
    为了更合理地安排劳力，小队长曾启华，除了重点深入一个作业组带头劳动以外，还对全面工作巡回做检查，因此他对队里每个社员的特长都很熟悉。这样，他就能根据各人的体力强弱、技术高低，恰当安排活路，做到人尽其才，各得其所。
    为使各项工作定额切合实际，干部经常带头同社员一起摸经验，制订合理的定额。如点包谷，党支部提的是一亩，试验结果只能完成六、七分，后决定改为七分；挖苕厢原定四分，经过试验，又修改为五分，使定额既先进又可行。
    小队实行了这些办法后，社员生产积极性很高。全队经常受到表扬的男社员占72％，女社员占47％。学先进、赶先进、超先进和帮后进已蔚然成风，从而促使小队的生产、工作不断跃进。（附图片）
