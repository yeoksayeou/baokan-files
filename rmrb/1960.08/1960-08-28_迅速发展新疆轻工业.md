Rapidly Develop Xinjiang's Light Industry
Gao Shuren, Director of the Light Industry Bureau of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region

Xinjiang is a rich and beautiful place with abundant raw materials for light industry. However, before liberation, the foundation of light industry here was very weak, with almost no modern light industrial enterprises, only some handicraft workshops of a family nature. The output was low, the variety was small, and most light industrial products depended on supplies from other places. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, Xinjiang's light industry has rapidly changed its backward state of "poverty and blankness." Many products that could not be manufactured locally in the past, such as machine-made sugar, machine-made paper, enamel products, industrial leather, soap, thermos bottles, light bulbs, batteries, glassware, and many major auxiliary materials needed for light industry, such as tannin extract and caustic soda, can now be produced in large quantities, with product varieties reaching more than 10,000.

The rapid development of Xinjiang's light industry has been achieved under the correct leadership of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, firmly implementing the Party's general line and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies. Xinjiang is vast and has inconvenient transportation, while 70% to 80% of the raw materials for light industry come from rural areas, and many products are mainly sold in rural areas. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a policy of focusing on medium and small-sized enterprises and combining indigenous and foreign methods, to run small factories and county and commune industries in a big way. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Xinjiang has established a large number of small light industrial factories, which have played a significant role in supporting agricultural production, fully utilizing local resources, increasing the income of commune members, and supporting large-scale industries. According to statistics, last year, the output of small-scale indigenous oil extraction accounted for about 42% of the total oil production. Many places have also built their own indigenous paper, indigenous sugar, and ceramic factories to meet local needs.

Running more small factories not only solves the problems of insufficient technical force and equipment supply but also prepares conditions for the construction of large factories. Many small sugar factories started with indigenous methods. Since the fourth quarter of last year, hundreds of sets of indigenous equipment have been put into production successively. After a year of exploration, these factories have begun to accumulate some experience and train cadres. Some places, based on their conditions, have expanded and built small mechanized sugar factories since this year, gradually developing small indigenous groups into small foreign groups. While running medium and small-sized factories in a big way, we also do not relax the construction of large-scale enterprises. At present, Xinjiang has established new types of modern light industrial factories for sugar making, leather making, fruit wine, canned food, enamel, ceramics, glass, and paper making. The newly built "August 1st" sugar factory, with a daily processing capacity of 1,000 tons of sugar beets, adopts the latest domestic equipment and technology, laying a preliminary foundation for the sugar industry in our region. The three mechanized paper mills in Urumqi, Shihezi, and Yili, which are about to be completed soon, will reverse the situation of our region's dependence on external supplies for newsprint and cultural paper after they are all put into production. With the development of light industry, Xinjiang's light industrial machinery manufacturing industry is also growing rapidly. Now, it is able to manufacture complete sets of small and medium-sized light industrial specialized equipment for paper making, sugar making, etc., providing convenient conditions for light industrial construction and technical transformation.

In the future, the focus of light industrial construction will be on the construction of industries such as sugar making, paper making, leather, light chemicals, and food. At present, we will first concentrate our efforts on the construction of the sugar making, paper making, and leather industries. Because these industries have abundant raw materials, are easy to concentrate, and the transportation conditions in the raw material areas are better. The construction of these industries can greatly expand the foundation of light industrial construction and drive the development of other light industries. In terms of regional distribution, we will make reasonable arrangements based on the development of transportation and other construction conditions, focusing on key areas and general areas respectively. We will plan and build light industrial bases in areas with superior raw materials, transportation, and other construction conditions, such as the Bosten Lake area, the Jinghe area, and the Yili area, and establish large-scale enterprises to better carry out diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, more effectively utilize resources, and further meet the society's needs for light industrial products.

Advocating that everyone run light industry is a shortcut to achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In recent years, other departments besides the light industry departments, such as the Production and Construction Corps, commercial and trade departments, agricultural and pastoral departments, cultural, educational, and health departments, and other industrial departments, have established a large number of light industrial enterprises, which have produced good results in all aspects, such as the development of the departments' own business, diversified operations, and enriching the supply of light industrial products. Experience has proved that this is a mass line for developing light industry in the vast Xinjiang region. Doing so makes it easier to give play to the enthusiasm of all parties in running light industry and is more conducive to the high-speed development of light industry. In fact, under the unified leadership and unified planning of the Party, the more people who run light industry, the more fully resources can be utilized and the more light industrial products can be increased to the greatest extent. In the future, we must continue to vigorously advocate that everyone run light industry, develop comprehensive utilization and diversified operations, and encourage all production departments to use by-products and waste materials to increase the production of light industrial products. The light industry departments should strengthen contact and cooperation with all relevant departments and help them run light industry as much as possible.

We deeply realize that launching mass movements, emancipating the mind, advocating a combination of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, and carrying out labor competitions of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping can accelerate the development of light industry. In recent years, mass movements to increase production and practice economy have been developing vigorously in all walks of life in light industry, and have reached an unprecedented upsurge until the first half of this year. This year's vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" has made Xinjiang's light industry look new every day. Up to now, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the fourteen major light industrial industries, such as paper making, leather, oil, and sugar making, has rapidly increased from about 12% to about 60%. Most of the production has been liberated from heavy physical labor and tedious manual operations, and many unprecedented miracles have appeared. For example, the Urumqi Enamel Factory mobilized the masses to realize production mechanization, saving 50% of the labor force and increasing production capacity by more than one time, realizing the transformation of one factory into two. Liu Zhaoxiang, a worker at the Tianshan Food Factory, created an automatic candy wrapping machine. This machine is made entirely of wood, and one person can replace eighty to one hundred candy wrapping workers. Driven by the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, this year, the production of Xinjiang's light industry has shown an unprecedentedly high leap forward scene. The annual plans for many products, such as industrial ceramics, enamel bowls, and reprocessed salt, were completed six months ahead of schedule, and the output of industrial ceramics, enamel basins, granulated sugar, alcohol, and reprocessed salt increased by one to four times compared with the same period last year.

The Autonomous Region Party Committee requires vigorous development of light industry, so that Xinjiang's light industrial products can achieve "having what is not available, having enough of what is available, and having more of what is enough," striving to achieve basic self-sufficiency in major light industrial products in the short term, and fully utilizing our region's abundant raw material resources, actively expanding production, and then supporting the country's industrial and agricultural construction. We believe that Xinjiang's light industry is fully capable of achieving the above requirements. In recent years, Xinjiang's light industry has built a preliminary foundation and strengthened its technical team; especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we have accumulated some production management experience and technical experience. With the tremendous development of industry and agriculture, especially due to the great development of heavy industry and agriculture, favorable conditions have been provided for the great development of Xinjiang's light industry.

Now, the situation on the Xinjiang light industry front is very good. The rapid construction of the Lanxin Railway is a great happy event that makes the people of all ethnic groups rejoice, and it will play an important role in promoting the great development of Xinjiang's light industry. As long as we continue to hold high the three red flags of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune; continue to strengthen the Party's leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, conscientiously implement the Party's policy of walking on two legs of both indigenous and foreign methods, and launch mass movements in a big way, we will definitely be able to make Xinjiang's light industrial products meet the requirements of "having what is not available, having enough of what is available, and having more of what is enough," and make Xinjiang's abundant light industrial raw material resources play a greater role in the country's socialist construction.

    迅速发展新疆轻工业
    新疆维吾尔自治区轻工业管理局局长  高树人
    新疆是个富饶美丽的地方，轻工业原料十分丰富。但是在解放前，这里的轻工业基础非常薄弱，几乎没有现代化的轻工业企业，只有一些家庭手工业性质的作坊，产量既低，品种又少，大部分轻工业品都依赖外地供应。解放后的新疆轻工业，在党的正确领导下，迅速改变着“一穷二白”的落后面貌。很多过去不能自己制造的产品，如机制糖、机制纸、搪瓷制品、工业用革、香皂、热水瓶、电灯泡、电池、玻璃器皿，以及轻工业所需的很多主要辅助材料，如栲胶、烧碱等，都可以大量进行生产了，产品品种达到一万多种。
    新疆轻工业能够取得如此迅速的发展，是在自治区党委的正确领导下，坚定不移地贯彻执行了党的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针。新疆幅员广阔，交通不便，而轻工业的原料70％到80％来自农村，许多产品又主要销于农村。因此，就必须采取以中、小型企业为主、土洋结合的方针，大办小型厂和县社工业。几年来，特别是从1958年大跃进以来，新疆建立起大批小型轻工业工厂，对于支援农业生产、充分利用当地资源、提高社员收入，以及支援大工业等方面，起了很大作用。根据统计，去年小型土法榨油的产量约占油脂总产量的42％。很多地方还自己建起了土纸、土糖、陶瓷等工厂，供应了当地的需要。
    多办小型工厂，不仅解决了技术力量不足和设备供应的问题，而且为大型工厂的建设准备了条件。很多小糖厂采用了土法上马，从去年四季度起，就有上百套的土设备先后投入了生产。这些工厂经过一年的摸索，开始积累了一些经验，培养了干部。有些地方根据条件，从今年起，已经扩建和新建了小型机制糖厂，小土群逐步发展成小洋群。在大办中、小型工厂的同时，我们也不放松大型企业的建设。目前，新疆已建立起新型的制糖、制革、果酒、罐头、搪瓷、陶瓷、玻璃、造纸等现代化的轻工业工厂。新建的日处理千吨甜菜的“八一”制糖厂，采用了国内最新的装备和技术，为我区制糖工业打下了初步基础。最近即将建成的乌鲁木齐、石河子、伊犁等三个机制纸厂，全部投入生产后，将扭转我区新闻及文化用纸依赖外地供应的局面。随着轻工业的发展，新疆轻工业机械制造工业，也正在迅速地成长壮大。现在，已经能够自己制造中小型的造纸、制糖等成套的轻工业专业设备，为轻工业建设和技术改造提供了便利的条件。
    今后，在轻工业建设方面，以制糖、造纸、皮革、轻化工、食品等工业的建设为重点，目前，则首先集中力量进行制糖、造纸和皮革工业的建设。因为，这些行业的原料丰富，便于集中，原料地区的交通运输条件较好。这些行业建设起来，可以大大地扩大轻工业的建设基础，带动其他轻工业的发展。在地区的分布上，则根据交通发展情况和其他建设条件，分别重点和一般，合理安排。有计划有步骤地在原料、交通和其他建设条件优越的地区，如博斯腾湖地区、精河地区、伊犁地区，建立轻工业基地，建立大型企业，以便更好地开展多种经营和综合利用，更加有效地充分利用资源，进一步满足社会对轻工业产品的需要。
    提倡大家办轻工业，是一条多快好省的途径。几年来，轻工业部门以外的其他部门，如生产建设兵团，商贸部门，农、牧部门，文教卫生部门和其他工业部门等，都兴办了大量的轻工业企业，这对各部门本身业务的开展，进行多种经营，丰富轻工业产品的供应等各方面，都产生了良好的效果。经验证明，在新疆地区辽阔的条件下，这是发展轻工业的一条群众路线。这样做，更便于发挥各方面办轻工业的积极性，更有利于轻工业的高速度发展。事实上，在党的统一领导下和统一规划下，办轻工业的人愈多，便愈能充分利用资源，愈能最大程度地增加轻工业产品。今后，还要继续大力提倡大家来办轻工业、发展综合利用和多种经营，提倡各个生产部门利用副产品、废料增产轻工业产品。轻工业部门则要和各有关部门加强联系和协作，尽最大的可能帮助他们办轻工业。
    我们深刻地体会到，大搞群众运动，解放思想，提倡苦干、实干和巧干相结合，开展比、学、赶、帮的劳动竞赛，就能加速轻工业的发展。几年来，群众性的增产节约运动，在轻工业各行各业中一浪高一浪地蓬勃发展，一直到今年上半年，则达到空前高涨的程度。今年蓬勃开展的以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，使新疆轻工业的面貌日新月异。到目前为止，造纸、皮革、油脂、制糖等十四个轻工业主要行业的机械化、半机械化程度，已由12％左右迅速地提高到60％左右。大部分生产，已经从笨重的体力劳动和繁琐的手工操作中解放了出来，出现了很多前所未有的奇迹。例如，乌鲁木齐搪瓷厂发动群众实现了生产机械化，节约劳动力50％，使生产能力提高了一倍以上，实现了一厂变两厂。天山食品厂工人刘兆祥，创造了自动包糖机，这种机器全部用木制，一个人可以代替八十至一百名包糖工人操作。在技术革新和技术革命运动的推动下，今年，新疆轻工业生产呈现出空前高涨的跃进景象。不少产品，如工业陶瓷、搪瓷碗、再制盐等，提前六个月完成了全年计划，工业陶瓷、搪瓷面盆、砂糖、酒精、再制盐的产量比去年同期增长了一至四倍以上。
    自治区党委要求大力发展轻工业，使新疆轻工业产品达到“没有的要有，有的要够，够的要多”，争取在短期内作到主要轻工业产品基本自给，并且充分利用我区丰富的原料资源，积极扩大生产，进而支援国家工农业建设。我们认为新疆轻工业完全有条件实现以上要求。几年来，新疆轻工业已经建起初步基础，壮大了技术队伍；特别是1958年大跃进以来，我们已经积累起一些生产管理经验和技术经验，随着工农业的巨大发展，特别是由于重工业和农业的大发展，已为新疆轻工业的大发展提供了有利的条件。
    现在，新疆轻工业战线上的形势十分良好。兰新铁路的迅速建设，这是一件使各族人民欢欣鼓舞的大喜事，对新疆轻工业的大发展将起着重要的促进作用。只要我们继续高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗；继续加强党的领导、坚持政治挂帅、认真贯彻党的土洋并举两条腿走路的方针、大搞群众运动，我们就一定能够使新疆的轻工业产品达到“没有的要有，有的要够，够的要多”的要求，使新疆丰富的轻工业原料资源，为国家社会主义建设发挥更大的作用。（附图片）
