　　On August 1st, the long coastline of the Fujian front was shrouded in a festive atmosphere, as officers and soldiers of the three services and the broad masses of militiamen celebrated the "August 1st" Army Day together.

　　On a position facing Jinmen, officers and soldiers of a certain company happily hung up thirty-five award banners and silk banners, marking their significant contributions to defending and building the motherland, and posted huge slogans such as "Inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of our army" and "Be on guard, severely punish war provocateurs," and held a celebration meeting. Since arriving at the front, these soldiers have patrolled the coastline day and night, regardless of sunshine or rain, winter or summer. They know every piece of land, every clump of grass, and every ditch here like the back of their hand. Today, they unanimously expressed that they would be a hundred times more vigilant and guard the gate of the motherland's coastal defense outpost. On a rocky mountain peak, radar soldiers celebrated Army Day at their battle stations. For several years, these radar soldiers, known as the "eyes of the motherland," have been constantly watching the changes on the fluorescent screen in radar rooms where they never see the sun. Every enemy plane and every warship cannot escape their eyes. Due to their outstanding achievements, they were awarded a collective second-class merit. At today's meeting, they all resolved to add merit to merit and create even greater achievements for the motherland.

　　Air Force soldiers today held various get-togethers at the airport while vigilantly watching the sky. Lieutenant Colonel Ji Shitang, a flight commander of a certain unit, and Major Cong Lanmao, director of the aircraft maintenance department, went to various posts early in the morning to extend holiday congratulations to the soldiers. Then they entered the command post and closely watched the activities of enemy aircraft. On a certain anti-aircraft artillery position, the soldiers built fighting slogans with shells: "Strictly guard the front, eliminate flying bandits!" They let the wind and rain blow, and the scorching sun bake, and they stayed with their guns at all times. When a bird flew by, they often treated it as a target, practicing how to catch it quickly and accurately, to improve their ability to defend the motherland. Today, the sailors on the front line sang and danced on the deck to celebrate the festival, taking advantage of the gap of vigilantly guarding the motherland's ocean. A certain escort boat, which has safely sailed thousands of nautical miles throughout the year, presented a generous gift to Army Day with its excellent achievement of a monthly red flag for sailing.

　　The front line was sunny and rainy today, and many leading cadres of the artillery部队 rushed to the front-line positions early in the morning to celebrate the festival with the soldiers. Liang Zhenhai, commander of the artillery regiment, and Yin Tiebo, deputy political commissar, whose entire regiment won a collective third-class merit in the 1958 battle to severely punish the Jinmen Chiang Kai-shek army, went to the third artillery position of a certain company and had cordial conversations with the soldiers who were guarding the gun positions. When they introduced the glorious tradition of the People's Army to the soldiers, and introduced the heroic and tenacious struggle of their regiment in battle, Zhuang Yachi, a gunner who performed extraordinarily well in the anti-American armed demonstration in June this year, immediately expressed to the regimental commander: Maintain honor, carry forward honor, and strive to be a model gunner. A celebration meeting was also held today at the artillery position where martyr An Yemin lived before his death. The gunners solemnly stated: The motherland has handed over the cannons to us, and we must use them to defend the motherland like An Yemin!

　　The militiamen on the front line rushed to the front-line positions today in the rain to congratulate the soldiers on the festival. Lin Dachuan, the militia company commander, Lin Anzhen, the instructor, and others came carrying gifts such as cantaloupe and cowpeas. As soon as they entered the position, they said: "You usually protect our production and help us with production. Today, you must taste the fruits and melons produced under your protection." During the celebration of the festival, the officers, soldiers and militiamen at a certain airport on the front line also held a poetry contest. The militiamen recited poems praising the heroic deeds of the Air Force soldiers on the front line, and the soldiers wrote poems thanking the people for their support. The soldier Wang Jinfu wrote a poem saying: Flowers need sunshine to bear fruit, and soldiers grow up entirely thanks to the Party; sunflowers face the sun, and soldiers will always follow the Party.

    节日在前线
       新华社记者　于逢源　夏维扬　冶峰
    8月1日，福建前线漫长的海岸线上笼罩着节日的气氛，三军官兵和广大民兵一同欢庆“八一”建军节。
    在面对金门的一个阵地上，某连官兵喜气洋洋地挂起标志着他们在保卫祖国、建设祖国中做出重大贡献的三十五面奖旗和锦旗，张贴出“继承和发扬我军光荣传统”、“严阵以待，严惩战争挑衅者”等巨幅标语，举行庆祝集会。这些战士从到前线以来，不分晴雨，不分冬夏，日日夜夜在海岸线上巡逻。他们对这里的每一片土地，每一簇草丛，每一条沟渠，都了如指掌。今天，他们一致表示，要百倍警惕，守好祖国海防前哨的大门。在一个巨石嶙嶙的山巅上，雷达兵们在自己的战斗岗位上庆祝建军节。几年来，这些被称为“祖国眼睛”的雷达兵，一时不停地在不见天日的雷达室里，注视着荧光屏上的变化，敌人每架飞机、每只军舰都逃不出他们的眼睛。由于他们功绩卓越，荣立了集体二等功。今天的会上，他们都决心功上加功，为祖国创立更大功勋。
    空军战士今天在机场上一面警惕地注视着天空，一面举行各种联欢活动。某部飞行指挥员吉世堂中校和机务主任丛兰茂少校，一早就到各个岗位上向战士致节日的祝贺。然后进入指挥部，严密注视着敌机的活动。在某高射炮兵阵地上，战士们用贝壳砌着战斗的豪语：“严守前沿，消灭飞贼！”他们任凭风吹雨打，烈日曝晒，时时刻刻人不离炮，炮不离人。当一只飞鸟飞来时，他们还常常把它当成目标，练习如何捕捉得快、准，来提高保卫祖国的本领。前线的水兵，今天在警惕地保卫祖国海洋的空隙，在甲板上载歌载舞，欢度节日。全年安全航行数千浬的某护卫艇，今天以航行月月红的优异成绩，向建军节献了厚礼。
    今天前线时晴时雨，炮兵部队的许多领导干部，一早就冒雨赶到前沿阵地同战士共度节日。在1958年严惩金门蒋军战斗中，全团荣立集体三等功的炮兵团团长梁振海、副政委尹铁波到了某连三炮阵地，就和严守在炮位的战士亲切地交谈。当他们向战士介绍人民军队光荣传统，介绍他们的团在战斗中一向英勇顽强的斗争事迹时，曾在今年6月反美武装大示威中表现得异常出色的炮手庄亚池立即向团长表示：保持荣誉，发扬荣誉，争取当模范炮手。在安业民烈士生前的炮兵阵地上，今天也举行了庆祝会，炮手们庄严表示：祖国把大炮交给了我们，我们一定要像安业民一样，用它来保卫祖国！
    前线的民兵，今天纷纷冒雨赶到前沿阵地向战士们贺节。民兵连长林大川、指导员林安镇等挑着香瓜、豆角等礼品来了，一进入阵地就说：“平时你们保卫我们生产，帮助我们生产，今天可要尝尝我们在你们保卫下生产出来的瓜果。”前线某机场上的官兵和民兵们在欢度节日中，还举行了赛诗会，民兵吟诗歌颂前线空军战士的英勇事迹，战士写诗感谢人民的支援。战士王金伏写诗说：花结子要阳光，战士成长全靠党；朵朵葵花朝太阳，战士永远跟着党。（8月1日）
