How the Commune History "Green Trees Become Shade" Was Written Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Creation Guidance Department
"Green Trees Become Shade" is a commune history reflecting the Xinmin People's Commune in Xinfan County, Sichuan Province. After its publication, this commune history has received much attention and welcome from readers. Although it only describes the growth process of a mutual aid team developing into a people's commune through cooperativization, because it grasps the mainstream of life, embodies the spirit of the times, and touches on the fate of the broad masses of peasants, the life picture it depicts appears magnificent and full of vitality. From the Xinmin Commune, people see the glorious road that other people's communes in other regions have traversed over the past ten years. They see the broad masses of peasants, in order to change the face of "poverty and blankness," constantly defeating capitalist spontaneous forces under the leadership of the Party, always adhering to the direction of cooperativization, and finally holding high the banner of the people's commune and advancing bravely. They see the great victory of the Party's political line and class line for the socialist transformation of agriculture after the land reform.

From the readers' feedback, "Green Trees Become Shade" can be said to be a mass literary creation that has achieved relatively high achievements. This achievement should first be attributed to the leadership of the Party. After the rectification campaign and anti-Rightist struggle in 1958, the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee instructed us to organize literary and art workers to go deep into factories, mines, and rural areas. On the one hand, they would directly participate in production and construction, live, eat, and work with the working people, combine intellectuals with the working people, and carry out ideological transformation. On the other hand, they would organize and guide mass amateur creation activities and help factories, mines, and communes to write their own factory histories and commune histories. The Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee also designated the Xinmin Commune in Xinfan County as the focus of writing commune history because the development process of this commune was highly representative. After our work team went down, the Xinfan County Party Committee specially established a commune history writing committee composed of a county party secretary and four party committee secretaries of the Xinmin Commune to directly lead this work.

The Party's leadership not only guaranteed the smooth progress of the writing work organizationally, but more importantly, it armed our writers ideologically. As soon as we arrived, in order to enable the writers to write the commune history from the Party's standpoint and the working people's thoughts and feelings, the writing committee, based on the Party's class line and policies in various revolutionary periods in the countryside, prompted and analyzed typical events and typical figures in each stage for the writers. A complete set of writing guidelines was determined: to take the class struggle carried out in the countryside over the past ten years as the key link, to take the growth of representative figures, especially advanced figures, as the main clue, and to summarize the tremendous changes in the countryside over the past ten years through the development process of the Luo Shifa mutual aid team. This gave our comrades a clear direction, and they quickly began the writing work.

Looking back now, this beginning was also a beginning of testing and training for the writers. For example, at the beginning, everyone was mobilized to write, and then the collator would process what was written. However, a month passed, and despite urging every day, nothing came out. Some cadres with stronger writing skills also could not submit their work because they were busy with work and did not have much time. As a result, some writers became discouraged and wavered. Some wanted to engage in their own creations; others felt that it was too difficult to mobilize farmers to write commune history and that it was very difficult to do, and there was a tendency to give up. This essentially meant that they did not believe that the working people had endless creative talents and wisdom, and that they did not believe that the working people had a strong desire to fully express their heroic spirit and revolutionary drive in building socialism. After learning about this situation, the leadership criticized and educated the writers, encouraging them to make up their minds to write this book. At the same time, it further pointed out that everyone must faithfully record the conversations of each narrator, try to preserve their storytelling style, and then collate and process it.

After this education, the writers were revitalized. And in a short period of time, the first batch of works was sorted out. However, the writers exposed some erroneous ideas in other situations, including standpoint, viewpoint, ideological understanding, and aesthetic viewpoint. Comrade Luo Shifa was talkative, and because he was very enthusiastic about writing commune history, he talked about everything the writers wanted to know. However, "Overturning Heaven and Earth," which was sorted out and processed based on his talks, was first criticized by Comrade Luo Shifa himself at the editorial board meeting: "The 'making revolution' in the phrase 'making revolution' is not strong enough, and too much personal stuff is written!" And he asked everyone: Why was it omitted how Huang Jingxian led the armed struggle against the landlords, how Yang Wanming took out the landlord's big and small measures and settled accounts with the landlords, and the vivid examples of the masses actively participating in the struggle? And this example just shows that our writers seriously lacked a correct understanding of the relationship between the masses and individuals, and the historical role of individuals.

"The First Kindergarten" was also one of the earliest records sorted out. Because the collator had a tendency to break away from politics and pursue so-called "artistic taste," this work retained a large number of jokes about the narrator, Ren Shuzhen, and the kindergarten teachers crying and making trouble because they encountered difficulties in their work. The profound significance of establishing kindergartens in liberating women's labor force and promoting production, the struggle of advanced elements against the force of habit, and the repeated education of kindergarten teachers by leading comrades were written very little. This article, "Compare," overly ignored the narrator's description of the masses' momentum in fighting against the spontaneous forces of capitalism and the superiority of the cooperative. Because the collator felt that the masses' talks were boring, he added some landscape descriptions out of thin air, such as "The evening birds return, and the fiery red sun hangs on the treetops of the western mountains," making the article sound foreign and nondescript. In fact, Xinfan is located in the western Sichuan Plain, and there are no mountains at all!

In the process of writing, a few comrades had adopted an attitude of examiners from high above to interview the masses. They did not get along well. In this way, even the narration was difficult to proceed, let alone let the masses tell those things that were the most impressive and the most emotionally intense. These comrades could only record a story outline, and some could not produce anything! In response to this situation, the editorial board emphasized that this book is a record of historical facts and required the writers to first be faithful recorders. At the same time, this book is also a mass literary creation, which requires the writers to concentrate the events more, and make the characters more vivid, so that it can better display the essence of life and have greater typical significance through recording and sorting, tailoring and arrangement, without violating historical authenticity. This requires the collators to have a correct standpoint, viewpoint, full of political enthusiasm and correct aesthetic viewpoint, and strictly implement the regulations of eating, living and working with the masses.

These instructions of the editorial board greatly enhanced the political and ideological awareness of the writers and further changed their erroneous view of underestimating the working people and their personal plans to engage in their own creations. Therefore, in a short period of time, the writers re-supplemented and sorted out the first batch of manuscripts according to the instructions of the editorial board; this batch of manuscripts powerfully convinced all the writers that although the peasant masses did not have a high level of education, they were more familiar with national folk art forms and had rich imagination and creative talents than our writers. Because the masses are participants in social events and masters of building socialism, they are most sensitive and familiar with the scene, details of the entire struggle and event, coupled with high political enthusiasm and simple and vivid language, which constitutes the moving power of the article. At the same time, through labor training, those writers who felt that the masses could not talk about things also improved their relationship with the masses and made friends among the masses.

Facts have proved that making friends with the peasant masses is the key to solving the entire writing work. Because since you can make friends, it shows that your point of view, standpoint, thoughts, and feelings are basically consistent with the working people. When chatting, it is also easier to make the writers' requirements and the masses' wishes coincide, so they can often accurately, specifically, and vividly tell you the essential significance of the struggle and the event from beginning to end. At this time, our recorders felt that the recording speed was too slow. Of course, this is not a recording speed problem, mainly because our comrades' life foundation is not enough, and their language knowledge is poor. Fortunately, everyone was in life at that time, and the problem was not difficult to solve: if you didn't remember it all at once, you would ask a second time, and even after sorting it out, if you felt that some details and scenes were not specific enough, you would have to ask clearly. Because at this time, the writers truly believed that the wisdom of the working people was inexhaustible and inexhaustible, and truly believed that the liberated working people must have the talent to express themselves, so they were willing to overcome difficulties in every possible way to make the works more perfect.

There are many examples of how the creative potential and wisdom of the masses were finally brought out through efforts. For example, "A Flag" writes that the rich peasant Yang Xiazi did not allow the mutual aid team to help Aunt Wan plow the fields, and the members of the mutual aid team reasoned and argued with Yang Xiazi. Initially, because the writers did not understand the important significance of this paragraph, the things they wrote were not specific and vivid. Later, under the instructions of the editorial board, the writers specially visited the members of the mutual aid team, and when they mentioned the past rich peasants bullying the poor peasants, they talked endlessly with resentment. Finally, according to the talks of the masses, our comrades rewrote the simple record of "digging at Yang Xiazi for a while" in the first draft as: "Feng Quan, who always made people unable to step down when he spoke, walked up to Yang Xiazi and said: 'Yang, don't tense up your three muscles! Don't think that we are not needed now, believe that when you die in two days, you will let the pigs arch you out? Although we are poor, we can still help you split two cypress branches!'" In this way, it powerfully expressed the strong and pungent class feelings of the poor peasants who hated the spontaneous forces of capitalism. The sorting out of "Dark Clouds Can't Cover the Sun" was also like this. After Yang Quan made a speech attacking the Party and cadres at the forum, he met Liao Jionghua in the teahouse. The recorded materials were relatively simple. We went to Liao Jionghua to ask him to recall the scene at that time. Why did he get angry when he mentioned Yang Quan? Liao Jionghua said: "He (referring to Yang Quan) sat on the chair in a grand manner, put his feet on another chair, and shouted: 'Come on, a double bowl!' Then he turned around and said to me: 'Teacher Liao, today I went to the Huayan Temple Cooperative to speak out, and when I came back, I drank tea and ate wine. I, your father, still want to speak out!'" These short sentences vividly portrayed the arrogant and complacent ugly state of this counter-revolutionary element at that time.

Because the writers resolutely implemented the instructions of the editorial board, and with the specific help of the editorial board, they gained experience in rewriting the first batch of manuscripts, they were able to more accurately brush off those unnecessary things, retain those specific plots that were enough to explain the essence of the event, and concentrate some details that should be concentrated, making the characters and events more vivid. For example, in the article "Another Storm," Zeng Yuqing's remarks immediately after Xu Jiying said: "I am a widow, and I am still dragging my children. No matter what they do, my mother and daughter will die in the community!" The narrator, Shi Liangchen, did not tell the writers. Because Shi Liangchen was standing at the door at the time and did not hear what Zeng Yuqing said clearly. But this passage is very helpful to show why Shi Liangchen was able to move from wavering to firmness in this community turmoil. The writers added it according to Zeng Yuqing's supplement. The paragraph about Minister Xiang in "Compare" was also added according to Luo Shifa's supplement. And all these embellishments were only for one purpose: to more deeply reflect the essence of the event.

Among the twenty-six short essays contained in "Green Trees Become Shade," the most processed and the most modified is "This Road Is Impassable." Because the narrator's talks were relatively scattered and relatively thin, they were compiled by supplementing with more members of the community. The writers also made many additions and changes in details and language to make it more compatible with other articles, and finally it was first approved by the broad masses of the Xinmin Commune. We believe that if the processing was carried out according to the ideological situation and aesthetic taste of the writers when they just started working, this article would be very likely to distort the essence of the event and be full of intellectual jargon. And this incident fully proves that: "Only by being a student of the masses first can you be a teacher of the masses."

Many readers have reflected that, as a literary creation, the significant characteristics of "Green Trees Become Shade" are that the characters are coherent, the stories are connected, the language is lively and vivid, and it has a strong atmosphere of life and distinct local characteristics. We believe that the achievement of this point is also inseparable from the writing method. Because since each article in the book is mainly based on the oral accounts of the representative figures in each stage of development of the Xinfan People's Commune, supplemented by the oral accounts of other relevant masses, and is written from the perspective of the narrator and from the feelings of the narrator's own experience, it is more likely to complete the above-mentioned characteristics using the first-person method. And these characteristics are generally factors that constitute national style and national spirit. This is certainly not the only way to complete the national style and national spirit, but from the perspective of the ideological and artistic level of the writers we sent down, this method is a better method.

Generally speaking, the writing process of "Green Trees Become Shade" is the ideological transformation process of the writers. Under the leadership of the Party, through the combination with the peasant masses, our comrades gradually realized the great power of the working people, thus changing their standpoint, viewpoint, thoughts, feelings, and aesthetic taste. In the writing work, all the writers deeply realized the great significance of Chairman Mao's instructions that literary and art workers must carry out ideological transformation. This is not only the case for engaging in professional creation, but also for doing a good job in guiding the masses, and this must be the case, without any ambiguity. Because this is an irrefutable truth that has been repeatedly proven by the development of my country's literary and art undertakings since the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

    公社史《绿树成荫》是怎样编写出来的	四川省文联创作辅导部
    《绿树成荫》是反映四川新繁县新民人民公社的一部公社史。这部公社史出版后，受到广大读者的重视和欢迎。因为它所记述的虽然只是一个互助组经过合作化发展成为人民公社的成长过程，但是，由于它抓住了生活的主流，体现了时代的精神，接触到了广大农民的命运问题，因而它所描绘出来的生活图景就显得波澜壮阔，气象万千。从新民公社一个公社，人们看到了其它地区其它人民公社十年来所经过的光辉道路，看到了广大农民为了改变“一穷二白”的面貌，在党的领导下，不断战胜资本主义自发势力，始终坚持合作化方向，最后高举起人民公社的旗帜奋勇前进的历史，看到了土地改革以后，党对农业进行社会主义改造的政治路线和阶级路线的伟大胜利。
    从读者的反映来看，《绿树成荫》可以说是一部获得较高成就的群众文学创作。这点成就的取得，首先应该归功于党的领导。1958年整风反右派斗争以后，省委宣传部就指示我们组织文艺工作者深入厂矿、农村，一方面直接参加生产建设，与劳动人民同吃同住同劳动，实行知识分子和劳动人民相结合，进行思想改造；一方面组织、辅导群众业余创作活动，帮助厂矿、公社编写自己的工厂史和公社史。省委宣传部并且指定我们以新繁县新民公社为编写公社史的重点，因为这个公社的发展过程具有较大的代表性。我们的工作组下去之后，新繁县委又专门成立了一个由一位县委书记和新民公社四位党委书记组成的社史编写委员会，来直接领导这项工作。
    党的领导不但从组织上保证了编写工作的顺利进行，更重要的是从思想上把我们的编写人员武装了起来。刚一下去，为了让编写人员能够用党的立场观点和劳动人民的思想感情去编写公社史，编委会就根据党在农村各个革命时期的阶级路线和政策，向编写人员提示并分析了每个阶段的典型事件和典型人物。确定了一整套编写方针：以农村中十年来所进行的阶级斗争为纲，以有代表性的人物，特别是先进人物的成长为主要线索，通过罗世发互助组的发展过程，以概括农村十年来的巨大变化。这就使得我们的同志有了一个明确的方向，从而很快开始了编写工作。
    现在回顾起来，这个开始，对于编写人员说来，也是一个考验和锻炼的开始。如开始时就发动大家来写，写出来再由整理者加工。可是，一个月过去了，尽管天天去催，还是搞不出东西来。一些写作能力较强的干部，也因工作繁忙，没有多少充裕时间，始终交不了卷。于是，有些编写人员泄气了，动摇了。有的想自己搞创作；有的认为发动农民写公社史困难太多，很不好搞，大有就此拉倒之势。这实质上是不相信劳动人民有无穷无尽的创造才能和智慧，不相信劳动人民有把他们建设社会主义的英雄气概和革命干劲充分表现出来的强烈愿望。领导上在知道了这一情况之后，对编写人员进行了批评教育，鼓励他们下定决心，一定要把这本书编写出来。同时进一步指明：大家一定要忠实记录每一个口述者的谈话，尽量保存他们讲故事的风格，然后整理加工。
    经过这一教育，编写同志重又振奋起来了。而且在较短时间内就整理出了第一批作品。可是，编写人员却又在另外的情况下暴露了一些错误思想，包括立场观点、思想认识和美学观点。罗世发同志是健谈的，而且，由于对编写公社史很热心，凡是编写人员想知道的，他都谈了。但根据他的谈话整理加工出来的《惊天动地闹翻身》，却首先在编委会上遭到罗世发同志本人的批评：“闹革命的‘闹’字写得不够，个人的东西写得太多了！”而且反问大家：为什么漏了黄静仙如何领导武装斗争地主，杨万明如何拿出地主的大斗小秤和地主算帐，以及群众积极参加斗争的生动事例？而这个例子恰恰说明了我们的编写人员对群众和个人的关系，以及个人的历史作用都严重地缺乏正确的理解。
    《第一个幼儿园》也是最早整理出来的记录之一。由于整理人员有脱离政治，追求所谓“艺术趣味”的倾向，在这篇作品里，大量保留了口述者任淑贞和保育员因为在工作中碰到困难而哭鼻子、闹情绪的各种笑话。对于创办幼儿园在解放妇女劳动力和推动生产上的深刻意义，先进分子对习惯力量的斗争，以及领导同志对保育员的反复教育，则写得很少。《比一比》这一篇，过多地忽略了口述人对群众向资本主义自发势力进行斗争的气势，和合作社的优越性的描述，因为整理者感觉群众谈得枯燥无味，便凭空加上一些“黄昏鸟归，火红的太阳挂在西山的树梢”之类的风景描写，弄得文章洋腔洋调，不三不四。事实上，新繁地处川西平原，根本就没有山！
    在编写过程中，有少数同志曾以高高在上的考官态度，去向群众进行访问。谈起来很不投机。这样，就连讲述也难于进行了，更谈不上让群众把那些印象最深、感情也最强烈的东西讲出来。这些同志，有的只能记下一个故事梗概，有的照样拿不出东西来！针对这种情况，编委会又着重指出，这本书是史实的记录，要求编写人员首先作好一个忠实的记录者。同时，这本书又是群众的文学创作，它又要求编写人员在不违反历史真实的前提下，通过记录和整理，剪裁和安排，把事件记述得更集中些，把人物表现得更鲜明些，使之更能显示出生活的本质和具有更大的典型意义。这就要求整理者一定要有正确的立场观点、饱满的政治热情和正确的美学观点，并严格执行与群众同吃同住同劳动的规定。
    编委会的这些指示大大提高了编写人员的政治思想觉悟，进一步改变了他们轻视劳动人民的错误观点，和那种自己想搞创作的个人打算。因而在较短时间内，编写人员根据编委会的指示，就重新补充整理好了第一批稿子；这批稿子有力地说服了所有的编写人员：农民群众尽管文化水平不高，但是比之我们的编写人员，他们是更熟悉民族民间文艺形式的，具有丰富的想像力和创造才能。由于群众是社会事件的参加者，是建设社会主义的主人，因而他们对整个斗争和事件的场景、细节的感觉也最锐敏、最熟悉，加上高度的政治热情和朴素生动的语言，这就构成了文章的动人力量。同时，通过劳动锻炼，那些感觉群众谈不出东西来的编写人员，也改善了他们同群众的关系，在群众中交上了朋友。
    事实证明，同农民群众交上朋友，是解决整个编写工作中的关键性问题。因为既然能够交上朋友，这就说明你的观点立场、思想感情跟劳动人民基本上一致了。在摆谈的时候也较容易使得编写人员的要求和群众的愿望投合，因而他们常常能够有头有尾，准确、具体、生动地把斗争和事件的本质意义讲给你听。到了这个时候，我们的记录者就共同感到记录的速度太差。当然，这也不是个记录速度问题，主要还是我们的同志生活基础不够，语言知识贫乏的缘故。好在当时大家都在生活当中，问题是不难解决的：一次记不全，又去问二次，甚至到了整理出来以后，感到某些细节、场面不够具体，还要专门去问清楚。因为这时候编写人员已经真正相信了劳动人民的智慧是取之不尽，用之不竭的，真正相信解放了的劳动人民一定有才能自己表现自己，所以愿意千方百计地克服困难，让作品整理得更完善些。
    经过努力，终于使群众的创造潜力和智慧涌现出来的例子是很多的。比如《一面旗帜》里面写到富裕农民杨瞎子不让互助组帮万大娘耖田，互助组的组员就和杨瞎子说理争论。最初，编写人员由于不理解这一段的重要意义，因而写出来的东西也不具体不生动。后来，经编委会指示，编写人员又专门找互助组的组员访问，而一提起过去富裕农民欺压贫苦农民，他们便带着愤恨滔滔不绝地谈开了。最后，我们的同志根据群众的谈话，将初稿中“把杨瞎子挖苦了一阵”一句简单记述改写成了：“向来一说话就弄得人下不了台的冯全走到杨瞎子面前对他说：‘杨么爸，你不要绷起你那三股筋！莫看现时用不到我们，肯信你二天死了会让猪来把你拱出去？我们虽然穷，到时候还是可以帮你劈两枝柏枝丫丫嘛！’”这样一来，就有力地表现了贫苦农民痛恨资本主义自发势力的那种强烈而辛辣的阶级感情。《乌云遮不住太阳》的整理也是这样，写到杨全在鸣放会上放了一通攻击党和干部的言论后，在茶馆里遇到廖炯华，记录材料较简单。我们就去找廖炯华，请他回忆当时的情景，为什么一提起杨全他就发火？廖炯华说：“他（指杨全）大模大样地往椅子上一坐，脚往另一张椅子上一跷，喊声：‘来个双碗’！然后车过身来对我说：‘廖师，今天我到华严寺联社去放了一下，回来喝了茶，吃了酒，老子还要去放！’”这短短的几句话，就绘声绘色地刻划出了这个反革命分子当时的嚣张和得意忘形的丑态。
    由于编写人员坚决执行了编委会的指示，以及在编委会具体帮助下重新编写第一批稿子取得了经验，能够较为准确地刷掉那些不必要的东西，保留下那些足以说明事件本质的具体情节，而且把一些应该集中起来的细节集中起来，使得人物和事件更加鲜明。譬如，在《又一场风波》这篇文章当中，曾玉清紧接着徐继英说的那一段话：“我一个寡妇，还拖着娃儿，任随他们怎样，我两母女，死也要死在社里头！”主述人史良臣并没有向编写人员说过。因为当时史良臣站在门口，没有听清楚曾玉清说的话。可是这段话对于表现史良臣在这次闹社风潮中之所以能够由动摇走向坚定，是很有帮助的，编写人员就根据曾玉清的补充，把它加进去了。《比一比》写到项部长那一段，也是根据罗世发的补充加进去的。而所有这些润色加工，只是为了一个目的：更能深刻地反映事件的本质。
    在《绿树成荫》所包含的二十六篇短文当中，加工最大最多的是《此路不通》这一篇。因为主述人的谈话比较零乱，比较单薄，是经过较多社员的补充编写成的。在细节和语言上，编写者也作了不少增改，使之更能和其他的文章相称，最后在新民公社的广大群众中首先得到了批准。我们相信，如果按照编写人员刚刚开始工作时的思想情况和美学趣味来进行加工，这篇文章很可能歪曲事件的本质，充满知识分子的腔调。而这件事充分地证明了：“只有先做群众的学生，才能做群众的先生。”
    不少读者反映，作为文学创作，《绿树成荫》的显著特点，是人物连贯，故事衔接，语言生动活泼，具有浓厚的生活气息和鲜明的地方色彩。我们认为，这点成就的取得，也是和编写方法分不开的。因为既然全书各篇是以新繁人民公社每个发展阶段的代表人物的口述为主，其他有关群众的口述为辅，是用第一人称的方法，从讲述人的角度，从讲述人目击身经的感受出发来写的，这就有了较大的可能来完成上述的一些特点。而这些特点，一般都是构成民族风格和民族气派的因素。这当然不是完成民族风格和民族气派的唯一方法，但是，从我们派下去的编写人员的思想艺术水平着眼，这个方法却是一个较好的方法。
    总的说来，《绿树成荫》的编写过程，就是编写人员的思想改造过程。在党的领导下，通过和农民群众的结合，我们的同志逐步地认识到了劳动人民的伟大力量，从而改变了自己的立场观点、思想感情和美学趣味。在编写工作中，所有编写人员都深切地体会到毛主席指示文艺工作者必须进行思想改造的伟大意义。这一点，不仅从事专业创作应该这样，就是要作好辅导群众的工作，也必须这样，一点不能含糊。因为这是毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表以来我国文学艺术事业的发展所反复证明了的一条颠扑不破的真理。
