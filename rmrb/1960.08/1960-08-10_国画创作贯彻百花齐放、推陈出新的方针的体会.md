Before liberation, I never really knew why I painted, and I was often troubled by not being able to find a way out. After the nationwide liberation, the Party brought new life to the cause of traditional Chinese painting and pointed out the correct direction for its development. From then on, I had a relatively clear goal to strive for. For eleven years, I have been transforming myself under the care and cultivation of the Party. My ideological awareness has gradually improved, which has made me feel the warmth of the Party even more, and how happy I am to live in the Mao Zedong era! How proud it is to be a painter in this great era!

Due to the change of the service object, the new era has put forward new requirements for our literary and art workers. Traditional Chinese painting, like other arts, has also taken on the new mission of this great heroic era. In order to mobilize all literary and art forces to better serve the workers, peasants and soldiers, and to serve proletarian politics, the Party proposed the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new." This policy is the road for the development of our socialist literature and art, and it has also opened up an infinitely broad future for the development of traditional Chinese painting. Traditional Chinese painting, like other arts, has conscientiously implemented the Party's literary and art policy and line for eleven years. First of all, it is reflected in the subject matter and content. The protagonists in our works are no longer those parasitic upper-class figures, but the heroic images of ordinary laborers who transform nature and create the world. In our landscape paintings, there are no longer desolate and lonely smoke and remnant mountains and rivers; but a large number of new landscapes reflecting the changes in mountains and rivers brought about by the broad masses of working people fighting against nature, and the beautiful rivers and mountains that can inspire people to love the motherland. In our flower and bird paintings, there are no longer sad crows in the setting sun, and withered leaves and branches; but a thriving, blooming, and inspiring scene. What a huge change this is! Whether it is figure painting, landscape painting, or flower and bird painting, it all embodies the new spirit of the times and the thoughts and feelings of the working people to a certain extent.

Since Chinese painting has a long history and has accumulated very rich experience, this solid cultural wealth is something we should be proud of. Traditional Chinese painting can stand out in the world art scene, first of all because it has distinct and rich national characteristics. It has always been against naturalism and formalism. It advocates "both form and spirit," pursuing both likeness and not departing from likeness. It has a very distinct scientific system for understanding and expressing objects. For example, to describe an ancient pine tree, the first thing to consider is not the surface form of the pine tree, but to examine its spiritual essence and explore its main characteristics that distinguish it from other flowers and trees. Therefore, when a painter expresses an ancient pine tree, he not only pays attention to expressing its different forms in different environments and different seasons, but more importantly, he embodies its spiritual essence through the description of the characteristics of the pine tree, and uses this to express the author's impressions; the strong character of the pine tree is often described as the embodiment of people's noble spirit. On the other hand, traditional Chinese painting has a high degree of artistic generalization in its expression techniques. Some people ask where the scenery in "Land So Rich in Beauty" is written about? We believe that although such scenery is not visible in reality, it does exist. The picture includes the northern scenery of mountains dancing like silver snakes, and the lush scenery of the south of the Yangtze River; it has both the Great Wall and the turbulent Yellow River; and the fertile land of the Central Plains; it is snowing in the west, and the rising sun is in the east. This is how we try to express the incomparably vast and beautiful rivers and mountains of our motherland from a high degree of generalization, so as to reflect the ambition of our people, which is comparable to the beautiful rivers and mountains. We attempt to combine the magnificent natural beauty and the spiritual beauty of the working people in the picture. This is our personal experience and attempt. In fact, the expressiveness of traditional painting is extremely rich, the techniques are extremely superb, and this painting form has extremely deep national feelings. Therefore, Chairman Mao has long called on us to learn from the excellent traditions, to create works with Chinese style and Chinese character, and correctly put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new." In the past eleven years, in our creative practice, because we have conscientiously followed this policy, implemented the principle of critically accepting heritage, and carried out innovation and creation on the basis of inheriting tradition, the content of new works and the traditional forms have gradually tended to be unified, and gradually formed new forms and new styles with national characteristics, so they have been loved and supported by the broad masses of the people, and opened up a new world for traditional Chinese painting creation to serve the workers, peasants and soldiers.

We used to habitually divide traditional Chinese painting into three categories: figure painting, landscape painting, and flower and bird painting. Although this classification originates from different subject matter and content, due to this division of labor and the result of historical development, they have gradually formed their own special forms and their own unique genres. Some people lump together flower and bird paintings as belonging to harmless things, which is not comprehensive. In fact, flower and bird paintings can express the decadent thoughts of the declining class, and they can also express the beautiful sentiments of the working people. As long as they follow the direction of serving the workers, peasants and soldiers, landscape paintings and flower and bird paintings still have an important place in our socialist garden of literature and art. Some people say that flower and bird paintings have no class character, or that things that serve the bourgeoisie can also be used to serve the proletariat, which is wrong. The class color of landscape and flower and bird paintings that express natural beauty is relatively hidden and tortuous. For example, some painters like to express the majestic mountains and rivers in nature; some painters like to describe the lotus that comes out of the mud without being stained; some painters like to describe the swallows that come with the spring; the choice of subject matter includes the author's preferences, and the objective natural scenery and the author's subjective thoughts and feelings are integrated in this way. What kind of subject matter the author adopts, and how to express this subject matter, cannot be separated from the tendency of class ideology. Therefore, works that describe natural beauty also reflect the class requirements of an era, and cannot go beyond class consciousness. Many of our new and relatively excellent landscape paintings and flower and bird paintings can correctly implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new" precisely because the painters' thoughts and feelings have changed first, and they have gradually become one with the thoughts and feelings of the working people, so they can create works that meet the aesthetic requirements of the broad masses.

However, in the combination of new content and traditional forms, there are difficulties and contradictions in the creative practice process. Because content determines form, and form must obey content in order to correctly reflect content. This is the subordinate relationship between content and form. Chairman Mao told us: To inherit and carry forward heritage, we must first make a scientific analysis and criticism of the heritage, discard its dross, and take its essence; we cannot make a well-founded and specific analysis and criticism without serious and serious study. At the same time, we have always opposed creating out of thin air without a traditional foundation, and we also oppose mechanically copying foreign things to replace creation. We oppose both nihilism that ignores national traditions and conservatism that clings to the old and refuses to change. Because this is contrary to the policy of "weeding through the old to bring forth the new." China's socialist cause is continuing to leap forward at an unprecedented speed. Under the encouragement of the three red flags, the people of the whole country are creating greater wealth for our socialist cause. Countless heroic images of transforming nature and creating the world are constantly emerging on various production fronts. These brand-new living contents are waiting for us to describe them and praise them. Under the requirements of this situation, we must strengthen the study of excellent traditions, and we must also have more and newer creations on the basis of tradition, especially creations in terms of expression forms and expression techniques. The contradiction between content and form arises in this situation. Without transforming the original forms and techniques, the new ideological content cannot be fully expressed. The process of unifying this contradiction is also the process of the emergence of new national forms and new styles. The content expressed by traditional Chinese painting is becoming richer and richer, which also promotes its expression form to become more and more diverse. The tremendous development of the cause of traditional Chinese painting in the short span of eleven years has achieved brilliant achievements that have never been seen in history. This proves that the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new" is an incomparably correct policy for developing socialist art.

Under the encouragement of the Party's general line for building socialism, traditional Chinese painters, like other artists, responded to the Party's call for intellectuals to become workers and peasants. Many people left their studios and went to the countryside and mountains. Practical life struggle knowledge has been enriched, the relationship with the working people has become closer, and the ideological level and artistic level of creation have also been significantly improved; and the creative themes and expression forms have become more and more rich and colorful, presenting an unprecedented prosperous scene. Of course, the achievement of these great achievements is the result of our conscientiously following the Party's literary and art direction and literary and art policies. The cause of traditional Chinese painting, like other arts, is an integral part of our Party's entire revolutionary cause. It has received the Party's infinite care and attention, and the Party's literary and art policies have given it unparalleled vitality. Its prospects are very bright and brilliant, and its future is infinitely broad.

    国画创作贯彻百花齐放、推陈出新的方针的体会	关山月
    解放前，我从来不大知道为什么画画，时常又感到找不到出路而苦恼。全国解放了，党给国画事业带来了新生，并指出了它发展的正确方向。从此，我就有了一个比较明确的奋斗目标。十一年来，我一直在党的关怀与培育下进行自我改造，思想觉悟逐步得到了提高，更加使我感到党的温暖，感到生活在毛泽东时代多么幸福！感到在这个伟大时代里当一个画家多么值得自豪！
    由于服务对象的改变，新的时代向我们文艺工作者提出了新的要求，国画和其他艺术一样也担负起了这个伟大的英雄时代的新的使命。党为了动员一切文艺力量能更好地为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，于是提出百花齐放、推陈出新的方针。这个方针就是我们社会主义文学艺术发展的道路，也给国画发展开辟了一个无限广阔的前途。国画和其他艺术一样，十一年来都认真贯彻了党的文艺方针路线。首先表现在题材内容方面。我们作品里的主人公，再不是那些寄生的上层人物，而是改造自然、创造世界的普通劳动者的英雄形象。在我们的山水画里，再也不是那些荒漠孤烟和残山剩水；而是大量反映广大劳动人民与大自然搏斗中所改变的山川新貌，和能激发人民热爱祖国之心的锦绣河山。在我们的花鸟画里，再也不是那些伤感的寒鸦落日，败叶残枝；而是欣欣向荣，争妍斗艳，令人欢欣鼓舞的景色。这是何等巨大的变化呵！不论人物画、山水画、花鸟画，都在一定程度上体现了新的时代精神，体现了劳动人民的思想感情。
    由于中国绘画具有悠久的历史，积累了非常丰富的经验，这份雄厚的文化财富是值得我们引以自豪的。国画在世界艺坛上能独树一帜，首先由于它具有鲜明而丰富的民族特点。它从来是反对自然主义，也反对形式主义的。它主张“形神兼备”，既追求神似，又不离开形似。对于认识对象和表现对象，有着非常鲜明的科学体系。比方要描写一棵古松，首先考虑的不是松树的表面的形态，而是考察它的精神实质，发掘出它有别于其他花木的主要特征。所以当画家在表现一棵古松的时候，就不仅仅注意表现它在不同的环境、不同的季节里的不同形态，更重要的是通过松树特征的描写来体现它的精神实质，并借此抒发作者的观感；松树的坚强性格，往往被描写为人的崇高精神的化身。另一方面，国画在表现手法上具有高度的艺术概括手段。有人问《江山如此多娇》是写哪里的风景？我们以为现实中虽然看不见这样的风景，可是的确有这么样的风景。画面上包括着山舞银蛇的北国风光，也包括着春意葱茏的江南景色，既有万里长城，也有滔滔的黄河；还有中原一带的肥沃大地；西方下着雪，而东方却是旭日高升。我们就是这样试图从高度概括中表现我们祖国无比辽阔的锦绣河山，从而体现与锦绣河山相媲美的我国人民的雄心壮志。我们企图把壮丽的自然美和劳动人民的精神美在画面上结合起来。这是我们个人的体会和尝试。其实，传统绘画的表现力是极其丰富的，手法是极其高强的，而且这一绘画形式是有极其深厚的民族感情的。所以，毛主席早就号召我们要好好地向优秀传统学习，要我们创作具有中国气派和中国作风的作品，并且正确地提出了百花齐放、推陈出新的方针。十一年来，我们在创作实践上，由于认真遵循了这一方针，贯彻了批判地接受遗产的原则，从继承传统的基础上进行革新和创造，使新的作品内容和传统的形式逐步趋于统一，逐步形成了具有民族特点的新形式和新风格，所以得到了广大人民的热爱和支持，开辟了为工农兵服务的国画创作的新天地。
    我们过去在习惯上把国画分为人物画、山水画、花鸟画三大类。这个分类虽然是出发于不同的题材内容，由于这个分工和历史发展的结果，便渐渐形成了它们各自的特殊形式和各自的独特体裁。有人笼统把花鸟画说成是属于无害一类的东西，这种说法是不全面的。事实上，花鸟画既可以表现没落阶层的颓废思想，也可以表现劳动人民优美的情操，只要遵从为工农兵服务的方向，山水画和花鸟画在我们的社会主义文艺的百花园里，仍然有着它重要的位置。有人说花鸟画没有阶级性，或者认为为资产阶级服务的东西同样可以拿来为无产阶级服务，那是错误的。表现自然美的山水、花鸟画，其阶级色彩是比较隐蔽和曲折的，例如有些画家喜欢表现自然中的雄伟山川；有些画家喜欢描写出污泥而不染的池莲；有些画家喜欢描写和春光一同来到的燕子；在题材的选择中就包括着作者的爱好，客观的自然风物和作者的主观思想感情就是这样地溶汇在一起。作者采取什么样的题材，以及如何表现这一题材，都不能脱离阶级思想的倾向性。所以说，描写自然美的作品，也同样反映一个时代的阶级要求，不能超于阶级意识之外。我们许多新的比较优秀的山水画和花鸟画，能够正确地贯彻执行百花齐放、推陈出新的方针，也正是由于画家们的思想感情上首先发生了变化，逐渐做到同劳动人民的思想感情打成一片，所以才能创作出符合广大群众欣赏要求的作品。
    然而，在新的内容与传统的形式的结合上，在创作实践过程中，并不是没有困难的，也不是没有矛盾的。因为内容决定形式，形式必须服从内容，才能够正确地体现内容。这是内容与形式的从属关系。毛主席告诉我们：对待遗产的继承与发扬，首先必须对遗产作科学的分析批判，去其糟粕，取其精华；不是认真严肃地研究学习，就不能作有根据的具体的分析批判。同时，我们从来就反对脱离传统基础的凭空创造，也反对硬搬外来的东西代替创造。我们既反对无视民族传统的虚无主义，也反对抱残守缺的保守主义。因为这是与推陈出新的方针相违背的。我国社会主义事业以空前高速度的持续跃进，全国人民在三面红旗的鼓舞下，为我们的社会主义事业创造着更大的财富，在各个生产战线上不断涌现出改造自然、创造世界的无数的英雄形象，这些崭新的生活内容，都等待着我们去描写他们，歌颂他们。在这种形势的要求下，促使我们在必须加强学习优秀传统的同时，还必须在传统的基础上有更多更新的创造，特别是表现形式和表现手法上的创造。内容和形式的矛盾就在这种情况下产生的，不改造原有的形式和手法，就不能充分表现新的思想内容。这一个矛盾的统一的过程，也就是民族新形式新风格的产生的过程。国画所表现的内容越来越丰富，也就促进了它的表现形式越来越多样。国画事业在短短的十一年的巨大发展，获得了历史上从来所没有的辉煌成就。这就证明了百花齐放、推陈出新的方针是发展社会主义艺术的无比正确的方针。
    国画事业在党的建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，国画家和其他艺术家一样，响应了党的知识分子工农化的号召，许多人离开了他的画室，纷纷下乡上山。实际的生活斗争知识丰富了，与劳动人民的关系密切了，创作的思想水平和艺术水平也有了显著的提高；而创作题材和表现形式也越来越丰富多采，呈现着一个前所未有的万紫千红的繁荣景象。当然，这些伟大成就的取得，是由于我们认真地遵循了党的文艺方向和文艺方针的结果。国画事业和其他艺术一样，它是我们的党的整个革命事业的一个组成部分。它得到了党的无限关怀和重视，党的文艺方针政策，又赋予它无比的生命力。它的远景是非常光辉灿烂的，它的前途是无限宽阔的。
