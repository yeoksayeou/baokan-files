Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 29th: "Hoy" published the resolution of the Eighth National Congress of the Cuban People's Socialist Party on the 28th. The resolution stated that the Eighth National Congress agreed with Comrade Blas Roca's report on the Party's work in the previous period and the general line implemented by the Party.

The resolution discussed the Party's unremitting struggle against tyranny. The resolution said that the Party has implemented and is still implementing the correct policy of striving to unite all people's revolutionary forces, which was for overthrowing the tyrannical rule in the past, and is now for defending and promoting the revolution.

The resolution stated that the Eighth Congress believes that the attack on the Moncada Barracks on July 26, 1952, organized and directed by Castro with one hundred heroic youths, was an action taken to launch a revolution in the country. Although the attack did not achieve its purpose, it achieved strategically significant positive results and initiated a qualitative change in the Cuban situation. The attack on the Moncada Barracks trained a contingent that, under Castro's leadership, insisted on armed struggle as the primary means to overthrow tyrannical rule.

The resolution also said that the landing of Granma (December 1957) was the origin of the guerrilla nucleus. The armed struggle of the guerrillas and the rebel army was the fundamental means of achieving revolutionary victory. The resolution said that nevertheless, the role played by mass struggles and revolutionary struggles in the plains in coordinating with the revolution to achieve victory should not be ignored.

The resolution pointed out that the guerrilla war was a protracted one. The guerrillas were able to persist because, first, they arose during a severe political crisis of tyranny; second, the vast majority of the people opposed tyranny; third, they were good at gaining the trust of the peasants; fourth, they avoided fighting at the beginning; fifth, they launched offensives under favorable conditions, thereby obtaining weapons and supplies; sixth, they had the concept of a long-term armed struggle and prepared for it, creating a consolidated guerrilla base.

The resolution said that the Party had correctly pointed out the prospect: mass struggles developed under the conditions created by tyranny until they became armed struggles or popular armed uprisings.

The resolution further stated that one of Castro's great historical achievements was to understand the timing and possibility of effectively developing armed struggle, practically prepare, organize, and control the necessary combat elements to start the struggle and persist, not to be discouraged by the serious and cruel initial setbacks, until defeating the tyranny and achieving victory.

The resolution said that our practical assistance to the guerrilla movement began at the time of the Granma landing, when we launched activities to prevent them from being wiped out immediately after landing, and this practical assistance developed and expanded during the struggle. The resolution talked about the Party's active assistance and participation in the armed struggle.

The resolution said that the armed struggle made the US imperialists' aid to the Batista tyranny more obvious, which helped many people understand the role played by imperialism and clarified the anti-imperialist nature of the struggle against tyranny.

The resolution said that when the tyrannical rule collapsed, the Party put forward the slogan of all power to the rebel army.

The resolution said that after the establishment of the revolutionary government, the Party exposed the conspiracies and attempts to create divisions. At that time, the Party declared that the main task was to defend and promote the revolution, and this task is still not outdated today.

The resolution pointed out that this revolution is an anti-imperialist and anti-latifundist revolution. Objectively, it serves the historical interests of the working class, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie. The driving force and leadership of the revolution are now the workers, poor and middle peasants, and the radicals of the urban petty bourgeoisie, who are powerfully united in an alliance, an informal, unwritten, but practical and active united front.

The resolution pointed out that the Cuban revolution occurred in an era when the balance of world power has shifted to the disadvantage of imperialism, the socialist camp is constantly developing, consolidating, and growing stronger, while the imperialist camp is constantly shrinking and weakening. This is a guarantee for the Cuban revolution.

The resolution then pointed out that Castro's leadership of the government and all revolutionary forces guarantees maximum unity. Castro has consolidated his revolutionary consciousness in the government and has become more radical. The resolution said that the government is now headed by an alliance of poor and middle peasants, radical urban petty bourgeoisie, and the proletariat.

The resolution pointed out that the imperialists and counter-revolutionaries, who have tried every possible means to overthrow the revolutionary regime, once believed that they could change the nature and essence of the revolutionary regime through hasty elections. The resolution pointed out that Cuba will hold elections at an appropriate time, in which the people will first be able to formally adopt the new constitutional norms that they have now actually implemented, to ensure the development of the revolution, definitively form the revolutionary state organs, and establish a political system without deception, lies, or political manipulation.

The resolution pointed out that the measures to nationalize American companies are a major step forward in the revolution and a qualitative change of great significance in the Cuban situation.

The resolution stated that this year, the few semi-feudal large estates that still exist should be eliminated. The work of issuing land certificates to farmers should be completed. The cooperative movement should be promoted on the basis of persuasion, demonstration, and encouragement. The resolution pointed out that a series of problems have emerged in the development of land reform. The principles for solving this series of problems are: first, to solve these problems on the basis of benefits and advantages for the poor and middle peasants, and not to harm the legitimate interests of the poor and middle peasants in any way; second, to take all necessary measures on the basis of persuading the masses of peasants.

The resolution said that the state-owned sector has grown with the development of the revolution. The dominant position and final victory of state ownership are guaranteed. The established state-owned sector makes it possible to seriously plan the diversification of agricultural production, industrialization, and domestic and foreign trade, including the production of private enterprises. The resolution also said that the profits of private enterprises have been limited by the new tax reform law.

The resolution emphasized that the number one enemy of the Cuban revolution, the US imperialists, has turned to economic war against Cuba, and it is the planner, instigator, and leader of all attacks and threats against the revolution. The imperialists have also launched a batch of agents into action against Cuba. The resolution said that the strong warning issued by the Soviet Union to the United States, that it must not plan any direct armed intervention against Cuba, stopped the preparations for this criminal activity. But the imperialists will adopt other means. They are attempting to use the Organization of American States, which until now has served as a colonial department of the United States, to plot armed aggression and isolate Cuba. The imperialists have rallied the counter-revolutionary groups active in the United States, stepped up their conspiracies and terrorist activities in Cuba, and are preparing to launch an armed attack by mercenaries and adventurers under the dirty and bloody banner of counter-revolutionaries and traitors. The danger of aggression, conspiracy, terrorist activity, and counter-revolutionary armed movements has increased.

The resolution pointed out that the Cuban revolution has all the conditions for achieving victory, because it has the support of 90% of the Cuban people. The revolution has the support of the people of Latin American countries, Asian and African countries, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries in the socialist camp, as well as the workers and people of the world. The Cuban people are determined to fight for their revolution until victory.

The resolution concluded by saying that in order to defend and promote the revolution, the focus of revolutionary attention and activity should be placed on the four points that are now of decisive significance: unity, production, defense, and revolutionary consciousness. The resolution pointed out the importance of strengthening the rebel army and the militia, as well as increasing vigilance, in order to detect the enemy's attempts to organize criminal activities everywhere. The resolution said that the work of defending and promoting the revolution requires a clearer mind and an increased understanding of Marxism-Leninism, in order to stop the enemy's conspiracies and prevent us from falling into serious errors, whether they are opportunist errors caused by revisionists, or extremist and dogmatic errors caused by blind activists, "left-leaning" infantilism, or inexperience. The resolution stated that national production should be continuously increased and improved, and that unity, ties, cooperation, and concerted action should be strengthened – especially between the "July 26th Movement," the People's Socialist Party, and the Revolutionary Directorate. The resolution pointed out the importance of strengthening the worker-peasant alliance and international solidarity. The resolution said that members of the People's Socialist Party have an obligation to be at the forefront of common revolutionary tasks in every way, and to unhesitatingly take up the posts assigned to them to serve the revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 29th: The latest issue of the Cuban "Hoy" published the summary speech made by Roca, General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, at the Eighth National Congress of the People's Socialist Party on August 21.

Roca pointed out that the enemies of the Cuban revolution have not given up trying to use force against Cuba. He called on all revolutionary forces in Cuba to maintain unity in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of the revolution. Roca said that a series of events in recent days have proved that counter-revolutionaries with armed personnel are gathering to carry out conspiracies. He said that murder cases and very serious intentions of sabotage have been discovered, and some weapons have been seized.

Roca emphasized that US imperialism is trying to use the Organization of American States to condemn Cuba, in order to arrange aggression against Cuba there. They will not give up their actions against Cuba. They are brewing a naval blockade against Cuba. Just as Morocco wanted to buy Cuban sugar, the United States gave Morocco loans and forbade it to buy Cuban sugar. The United States also called on its NATO partners not to buy Cuban goods. Japan and West Germany began to create difficulties in fulfilling their economic agreements with Cuba. All of the United States' puppets have begun to create difficulties for Cuba in their economic relations with Cuba.

Roca pointed out that some people do not care about the militia and the issue of mastering arms, and they believe that the enemy will not come. This idea is the most dangerous.

Roca said that the Cuban revolution can achieve victory because Cuba has invaluable international support. Standing with Cuba are the people of Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Europe, as well as socialist countries.

While emphasizing the importance of the unity of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, he said that this unbreakable unity is based on the invincible principles of Marxist-Leninist theory. Roca said that the more united the Communist and Workers' Parties are, the more rapidly the rule of imperialism in the world will collapse.

Roca said that the People's Socialist Party has always maintained rock-solid unity since its establishment. Roca also emphasized the importance of unity among all revolutionary forces in Cuba in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of the revolution.

    古巴人民社会党第八次全国代表大会决议指出
    古巴人民决心为革命胜利坚持斗争
    罗加在党代表大会上作总结发言号召古巴革命力量在反帝斗争中保持团结
    新华社哈瓦那29日电　“今日报”28日登载了古巴人民社会党第八次全国代表大会的决议。决议说，第八次全国代表大会同意布拉斯·罗加同志关于前一时期党的工作和党所执行的总路线的报告。
    决议谈到了党反对暴政的不懈的斗争。决议说，党执行了并仍然在执行着过去为了推翻暴政统治、现在为了保卫革命和推进革命而力求团结一切人民革命力量的正确政策。
    决议说，第八次代表大会认为，1952年7月26日由卡斯特罗组织和指挥的一百名英勇的青年袭击蒙卡达兵营是为了在国内发动革命而采取的一个行动。尽管这次袭击没有达到目的，但是取得了有战略意义的积极成果，并使古巴的形势开始发生质的变化。在对蒙卡达兵营的袭击中，锻炼了后来在卡斯特罗的领导下坚持以武装斗争作为推翻暴政统治的主要手段的队伍。
    决议又说，格拉马的登陆（1957年12月）是游击核心的起源。游击队和起义军的武装斗争是取得革命胜利的根本手段。决议说，尽管如此，不应该忽视配合革命取得胜利的群众斗争和平原革命斗争所起的作用。
    决议指出，游击队的战争是长期的。游击队之所以能够坚持，是因为第一，它们是在暴政严重政治危机中产生的；第二，绝大多数人民反对暴政；第三，它们善于取得农民的信任；第四，它们在开始时避免进行战斗；第五，它们在有利的条件下进行进攻，从而取得武器和补给；第六，它们具有长期武装斗争的观念并为此进行准备，创造了一个巩固的游击根据地。
    决议说，党曾经正确地指出了前景：群众斗争在暴政所造成的条件下发展直到成为武装斗争或人民武装起义。
    决议又说，卡斯特罗的一个重大历史功绩是，懂得有成效地发展武装斗争的时机和可能，实际地准备、组织和支配必要的战斗因素，以开始斗争并坚持下去，不因开始时的严重的残酷的失利而气馁，直到击溃暴政取得胜利。
    决议说，我们对游击运动的实际援助开始于格拉马号登陆的时候，当时我们展开活动，避免他们在登陆后立即被消灭，这种实际援助在斗争过程中发展和扩大了。决议谈到党积极援助和参加了武装斗争。
    决议说，武装斗争使美帝国主义对巴蒂斯塔暴政的援助更加明显了，这有助于许多人懂得了帝国主义所起的作用，明确了反对暴政的斗争所具有的反帝性质。
    决议说，在暴政统治倒台时，党提出了一切权力归起义军的口号。
    决议说，革命政府成立以后，党揭露了制造分裂的阴谋企图。当时党宣布，主要的任务是保卫和推进革命，这个任务今天仍然没有过时。
    决议指出，这个革命是反帝国主义和反大庄园制度的革命。它客观上是为工人阶级、农民、城市小资产阶级和民族资产阶级的历史利益服务的。革命的原动力和领导力量现在是工人、贫农和中农以及城市小资产阶级的激进派，他们有力地团结在一个联盟，一个非正式的、没有明文规定的、然而是实际和活跃的统一阵线中。
    决议指出，古巴革命是在世界力量对比转为对帝国主义不利的时代，社会主义阵营不断发展、巩固和壮大，而帝国主义阵营不断萎缩和削弱的时代中发生的。这是对古巴革命的一个保障。
    决议随后指出，卡斯特罗对政府和一切革命力量的领导保证了最大限度的团结。卡斯特罗在政府中巩固了他的革命觉悟，更加激进了。决议说，现在政府是以贫农和中农、激进城市小资产阶级和无产阶级的联盟为首的。
    决议指出，千方百计地企图推翻革命政权的帝国主义者和反革命分子曾经认为，他们能够通过匆促的选举来改变革命政权的性质和本质。决议指出，古巴将在适当的时期进行选举，在选举中人民首先将能够正式通过他们现在实际上已经实现了的新宪法准则，来保证革命的发展，确定地组成革命的国家机构，建立一个没有欺骗、没有谎言、不玩弄政治手腕的政治制度。
    决议指出，把美国公司收归国有的措施是革命前进的一个重大步骤，是古巴局势中一个具有重大意义的质变。
    决议表示，今年应当消灭现在还存在着的为数不多的半封建性的大庄园。应该完成向农民们发土地证的工作。在说服、示范和鼓励的基础上推动合作化运动。决议指出，在土地改革的发展过程中，出现了一系列的问题。解决这一系列问题的原则是：第一，在对贫农和中农有利益和好处的基础上解决这些问题，不能以任何方式损害贫农和中农的合法利益；第二，在说服农民群众的基础上采取一切必要的措施。
    决议说，国有制部门已随着革命的发展而增长。国有制的优势地位和最后胜利已有保证。已建立的国有制部门使得可以认真地计划农业生产的多样化、工业化和国内外贸易，包括私营企业的生产。决议又说，私营企业的利润已受到新税收改革法的限制。
    决议强调指出，古巴革命的头号敌人美帝国主义者转入了对古巴的经济战，它是对革命的一切进攻和威胁的策划者、煽动者和领导者。帝国主义者又发动一批代理人投入了反对古巴的行动。决议说，苏联向美国提出的，不得策划对古巴的任何直接武装干涉的有力的警告制止了这个罪恶活动的准备工作。但是帝国主义者将采用其他手段。他们企图利用直到现在为止起着美国的殖民部作用的美洲国家组织来策划武装侵略和孤立古巴。帝国主义者纠合了在美国活动的反革命集团，加紧了他们在古巴的阴谋和恐怖活动，并准备在反革命和叛徒的肮脏血腥的旗帜下发动雇佣兵和冒险家的武装进攻。侵略、阴谋、恐怖活动和反革命武装运动的危险增加了。
    决议指出，古巴革命具有取得胜利的一切条件，因为它拥有90％古巴人民的支持。革命拥有拉丁美洲各国人民、亚非国家、苏联、中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营其他国家以及全世界的劳动者和人民的支援。古巴人民决心为了自己的革命进行斗争，直到取得胜利。
    决议最后说，为了保卫革命和推进革命，应该把革命关注和活动的重点放在现在有决定意义的四点上，这就是：团结，生产，国防和革命觉悟。决议指出了加强起义军和民兵，以及提高警惕，以便在敌人企图组织罪恶活动的一切地方破获他们的重要性。决议说，保卫和推进革命的工作要求更加明确思想，提高马克思列宁主义的认识，以便制止敌人的阴谋，并使我们不致落入严重的错误，不管是修正主义者导致的机会主义错误，或是盲动者、“左倾”幼稚病者或由于没有经验造成的极端主义和教条主义的错误。决议表示，应该不断提高和改进国家生产，应该——特别是在“7月26日运动”、人民社会党和革命指导委员会之间——巩固团结，加强联系，加强合作和一致行动。决议指出了加强工农联盟和国际声援的重要性。决议说，人民社会党党员有义务在共同的革命任务中处处走在前面，毫不犹疑地走上指给他们的岗位为革命服务。
    新华社哈瓦那29日电　最近一期的古巴“今日报”星期日刊登载了古巴人民社会党总书记罗加8月21日在人民社会党第八次全国代表大会上的总结发言。
    罗加指出，古巴革命的敌人并没有放弃对古巴使用武力的尝试。他号召古巴的一切革命力量在反对帝国主义和保卫革命的斗争中保持团结。罗加说，最近几天发生的一系列事件，证明拥有武装人员的反革命分子正在聚集起来进行阴谋活动。他说，已经发现了谋杀案件和非常严重的破坏意图，并且缴获了一些武器。
    罗加强调指出，美帝国主义企图利用美洲国家组织来谴责古巴，以便在那里布置对古巴的侵略。他们不会放弃反对古巴的行动。他们正在酝酿对古巴进行一次海上封锁。正当摩洛哥希望购买古巴糖的时候，美国给了摩洛哥贷款，并且禁止它购买古巴糖。美国还号召它的北大西洋公约组织的伙伴不要买古巴的东西。日本和西德开始在履行它们与古巴签订的经济协定上制造困难。所有美国的傀儡都开始在他们与古巴的经济关系上给古巴制造困难。
    罗加指出，有人不关心民兵和掌握武装的问题，他们认为敌人不会来。这种想法是最危险的。
    罗加说，古巴革命能够取得胜利，因为古巴拥有无可估价的国际支援。同古巴站在一起的有拉丁美洲、非洲、亚洲和欧洲各国的人民以及社会主义国家。
    他在强调指出各国共产党和工人党团结的重要性时说，这个牢不可破的团结是以不可战胜的马列主义理论原则为基础的。罗加说，共产党与工人党阵营愈加团结，帝国主义在世界上的统治愈将迅速地倒台。
    罗加说，人民社会党成立以来一贯保持着坚如磐石的团结。罗加还强调指出了在反对帝国主义和保卫革命的斗争中古巴一切革命力量团结的重要性。
