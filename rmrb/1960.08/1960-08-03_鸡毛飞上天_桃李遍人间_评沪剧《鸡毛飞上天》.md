    Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky, Peach and Plum Trees Everywhere
    -- A Review of the Shanghai Opera "Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky" by Liu Housheng and Gong Yijiang

    The Shanghai People's Shanghai Opera Troupe's collective creation and performance of "Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky" was warmly welcomed by audiences in Shanghai, especially teachers and parents. In the current Great Cultural Revolution movement, at a time when the Party is advocating self-reliance, running schools diligently and thriftily, and promoting the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, this play demonstrates its high spirit of the times and practical educational significance. Whether from an ideological or artistic point of view, "Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky" can be regarded as one of the outstanding modern-themed opera scripts of 1960.

    Lin Peifen faced many difficulties in running a private school, but what was the biggest difficulty, or rather, the main contradiction? Based on real life, the authors of "Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky" did not place the main contradiction on the difficulties and hardships of material equipment, nor on the lack of teaching experience. These were not difficult problems to solve in the new society. They did not even focus on the struggle with naughty children. From beginning to end, the authors consistently placed the most central contradiction on the struggle between the ideology of the working class and the ideology of the bourgeoisie. This is completely correct and in line with the reality of life. In Shanghai, the remnants of bourgeois ideology still have a considerable influence. They also superficially agree to run schools, but they only see material things and not people. What they care about is not who runs the school, but how "grand" the material equipment is. They also care about people, but they care about people's "qualifications" rather than the moral character of the working class. From the beginning, they were observers of running such a "poor and broken" private school, waiting for jokes to happen. They would rather write their own names backwards than believe that the private school could be run well. Therefore, Lin Peifen's struggle has an extremely profound significance in the struggle between two roads and two ideologies. "Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky" grasped this theme very powerfully and with a lot of action. For example, in the sixth scene, just as the conflict between the bourgeois housewife Gu Huizhen and Lin Peifen gradually develops, the most naughty student Sun Hurong ignores Peifen's advice and spits on Lin Peifen's face, such insult that student makes to the teacher greatly shocks Lin Peifen. Gu Huizhen also takes this opportunity to satirize both the teacher and the student. How should Lin Peifen deal with the two insults before her? She sings emotionally:

    　　A spit is a small matter,
    　　Peifen doesn't get childish,
    　　It's because the teacher's responsibility is not fulfilled,
    　　So the child is too naughty;
    　　But Gu's words,
    　　Every sentence stabs in my heart,
    　　Calling them rascals all the time,
    　　Clearly looking down on the children of workers,
    　　…After hearing these words,
    　　We don't argue, we want to fight for honor,
    　　We must adhere to the Party's education policy, …
    　　Run the private school well, by all means,
    　　Help Hurong correct his shortcomings,
    　　So that he becomes an outstanding child of the working class,
    　　Be poor but have ambition,
    　　Must let chicken feathers fly to the sky!

    Lin Peifen demonstrates strong class feelings and correct class viewpoints here, as well as her tenacious fighting will. She fully understands the important significance of running a private school, sees what is hindering the progress of the cause, and further clarifies her determination to dedicate herself to education. The theme is embodied in such scenes, and the heroic figure is vividly established and enriched in the sharp struggle.

    If the contradiction between Lin Peifen and Sun Hurong is taken as the main opposition, then after the ninth scene, Lin Peifen chases Sun Hurong, who is ashamed and fearful for doing wrong, through the streets in a heavy thunderstorm, deeply moving him. By the tenth scene, Lin Peifen changes clothes for Sun Hurong at her own home, telling the story of her failure to attend school in her childhood, touching little Hurong from the bottom of her heart. Little Hurong admits his mistake for the first time and is determined to "be a truly good student." At this point, the contradiction has been resolved, and the final eleventh scene becomes superfluous. However, the authors did not write the last scene as a general party, but designed a wonderful and highly dramatic detail: The ignorant, selfish, and self-righteous Gu Huizhen still refuses to believe that Sun Hurong has improved in the face of the facts. She maliciously puts two yuan on the table. When Sun Hurong takes the money away, she gloats and howls: "Who says the private school is run well, ...How can a wild bird become a phoenix?" But Sun Hurong takes the money to the teacher, finally leaving her speechless and powerfully counterattacking the bourgeois ideology that despises private education. Only here does the play complete the highest task of the theme.

    The reason why Lin Peifen's image (played by Ding Shi'e) is moving is mainly because it profoundly writes and performs the character's spirit of utter devotion and boundless enthusiasm for the revolutionary cause. Only with this spiritual quality can the character be credible in trying every means to overcome difficulties and persevering without wavering in the face of failures and setbacks.

    As an opposite, the image of Gu Huizhen (played by Shi Xiaoying), a woman from a bourgeois family, is also very successful. In her, one feels the character's inner contempt for the working people and the superficial need to restrain herself, the inner and outer contradictions, thus revealing her hypocrisy. Naturally, due to the character's superficiality and ignorance, sometimes, ugly thoughts are also exposed nakedly. From her initial ridicule of the private school to her later quarrel with Hurong for her own son, she finally couldn't help but say the words "private school students are all like little hooligans," because the students of the private school are all children of working people, and in her view, working people are "difficult for a mud loach to become a dragon." In order to prove her point of view, she designed to use two yuan to test Hurong. These are all very vivid places to portray the character's personality. This kind of thinking runs through the character's entire actions. Even in a short dialogue with the old cobbler about a pair of embroidered slippers, the "boss's wife" who "opens her mouth when food comes and stretches out her hand, wandering from East Street to West Street" reveals her impatient attitude towards the working people. The second scene is a transitional scene, but it is a powerful stroke to expose the hypocritical face of this character. Lin Peifen and Lu Qiong go door-to-door to mobilize parents to enroll their children in private schools. Gu Huizhen is unwilling to enroll. Seeing them coming from afar, she hurriedly turns around and closes the door. Lu Qiong calls the door, and she changes her accent inside the door and says she is out. Lin Peifen bluntly exposes her, saying that she just saw her entering the door. She has nothing to say and has to reluctantly open the door to meet them. The most foolish thing in the world is not knowing that you are foolish, but thinking that you are the smartest. The image of Gu Huizhen created by Shi Xiaoying precisely demonstrates the characteristics of this type of person.

    This play is a collective creation of the troupe's actors. In order to present a gift to the Shanghai Cultural and Educational Work Conference that was being held at the time, it only took ten days to complete the creation and rehearsal of such a large script. This is another new victory in carrying out the mass creation movement, indicating that the masses can not only write, but also write quickly; not only can they write quickly, but also they can write well.

### 鸡毛飞上天　桃李遍人间——评沪剧《鸡毛飞上天》

    鸡毛飞上天　桃李遍人间
    ——评沪剧《鸡毛飞上天》	刘厚生　龚义江
    上海人民沪剧团集体创作、演出的《鸡毛飞上天》在上海演出时，受到了观众、特别是教师、家长们极为热烈的欢迎。在当前文化大革命运动中，在党提倡自力更生、勤俭办学，提倡苦干、实干、巧干的工作精神时，这出戏显示了自己的高度的时代精神和现实教育意义。无论从思想性或从艺术性来说，《鸡毛飞上天》都可以被认为是1960年中优秀的现代题材戏曲剧本之一。
    林佩芬办民校有很多困难，但最大的困难，或者说，最主要的对立面是什么？《鸡毛飞上天》的作者们根据现实生活，把主要对立面不放在物质设备的困难艰苦上，也不放在没有教学经验上，这些，在新社会中原不是什么难以解决的问题；甚至也不放在与顽劣儿童的斗争上，作者们从开始到结束，把最中心的矛盾始终放在工人阶级思想与资产阶级思想的斗争上面。这是完全正确的，符合于生活真实的。在上海，资产阶级思想残余，还有着相当影响，他们表面也赞成办学校，但他们见物不见人，关心的不是什么人办学校，而是物质设备“气派”如何；他们也关心人，但关心的是人的“资格”，而不是工人阶级的道德品质。他们对于办这样“穷破”的民校，一开头就是观潮派，专等出笑话，宁肯把自己的名字倒过来写也不相信民校能办好。因此，林佩芬的斗争意义就具有了极为深刻的两条道路两种思想的斗争意义了。《鸡毛飞上天》在掌握这个主题思想上抓得很有力量，很富于动作性。如在第六场，正当资产阶级家庭妇女顾惠珍与林佩芬之间的矛盾冲突逐步发展时，最顽皮的学生孙虎荣不听佩芬的劝诫，一口唾沫吐在林佩芬脸上，学生对老师这样的侮辱使林佩芬大为震动。顾惠珍又借此机会对师生两人一起大肆讥刺。林佩芬如何对待摆在面前的两重侮辱呢？她激动地唱道：
    一口唾沫小事体，
      佩芬不生孩子气，
    这是老师责任未尽到，
      所以孩子太顽皮；
    倒是顾师母的一番话，
      句句刺在我心里，
    流氓长流氓短，
      分明将工人子弟看不起，
    ……我们听了这番话，
      不争嘴，要争气，
    我们要坚持党的教育方针，……
      办好民校，千方百计，
    帮助虎荣改正缺点，
      使他成为工人阶级的优秀子弟，
    穷要穷得有志气，
      定要鸡毛飞上天！林佩芬在这里表现了强烈的阶级感情和正确的阶级观点，也表现了她的顽强的斗争意志。她完全懂得了办民校的重要意义，看到了阻碍事业前进的到底是什么东西，更加明确了自己献身教育事业的决心。主题思想在这样的场景中得到了形象的体现，英雄人物也在尖锐的斗争中鲜明地树立而且丰富了起来。
    如果把林佩芬与孙虎荣的矛盾作为主要对立面，那末，经过了第九场林佩芬在大雷雨中满街追赶因做错了事心中愧惧的孙虎荣，使他深受感动；到了第十场林佩芬在自己家里为孙虎荣换衣服，讲述自己幼年读书不成的故事，从心底打动了小虎荣，小虎荣第一次承认了自己的错误，下决心“做一个真正的好学生”。到这里，矛盾已经解决，最后的第十一场就成为多余了。但是作者们没有把末一场写成一般化的联欢会，而设计了一段精彩的极富于戏剧性的细节：愚昧自私而又自以为是的顾惠珍在事实面前仍然不肯相信孙虎荣已经改好，恶毒地把两块钱放在桌上，当孙虎荣把钱拿走后，她幸灾乐祸地嚎叫：“谁说民校办得好，……野鸟怎变凤凰鸟？”但是孙虎荣将钱拿去是交给了老师，终于使她哑口无言，有力地还击了那种轻视民办教育的资产阶级思想。戏到这里，方才完成了主题的最高任务。
    林佩芬（丁是娥饰）形象之所以动人，最主要的是深刻地写出和演出了人物对革命事业忠心耿耿无限热忱的精神。只有具有这种精神品质，人物千方百计地去克服困难，在失败和打击下坚持不动摇才是可信的。
    作为一个对立面，资产阶级家庭的妇女顾惠珍（石筱英饰）的形象塑造，也是很成功的。在她的身上，令人感到人物内心轻视劳动人民和表面不得不有所收敛，里外矛盾，从而显露出来的虚伪性。自然，由于人物的肤浅、愚昧，有时候，丑恶的思想也会赤裸裸地暴露出来。她从最初对民校的冷嘲热讽，到后来为了自己儿子和虎荣吵闹，终于忍不住说出“民校学生都像小流氓”的话来，因为民校的学生都是劳动人民子弟，而劳动人民在她看来是“曲鳝难以修成龙”的，为了证明自己的看法，她设计用两块钱来考验虎荣，这些都是很形象地刻划人物的性格的地方，这种思想贯穿在人物的全部行动之中，即使与老皮匠，为一双绣花拖鞋所作的两句简短的对话中，也流露出这位“饭来开口伸手，东街荡来西街走”的“老板娘”那种对劳动人民不耐烦的态度。第二场是一个过场戏，但对揭露这人物的虚伪面貌却是有力的一笔。林佩芬和陆琼挨户动员家长给孩子报名进民校，顾惠珍不愿报名，老远看见她们来了，急忙回身关上门，陆琼叫门，她在门内改变口音说出去了。林佩芬直截了当地拆穿她，说是刚见她进门的。她无词可对，只得讪讪地开门出见。天下最愚蠢的莫过于不知是愚蠢，反以为自己最聪明。石筱英创造的顾惠珍的形象，正是表现了这一类人物的特点。
    这戏是剧团演员集体创作的。为向当时正在举行的上海文教工作会议献礼，只用了十天的时间就完成了这样一个大型剧本的创作和排练，这是开展群众创作运动又一次新的胜利，说明群众不但能写作，而且可以写得快；不仅能写得快，而且能写得好。
