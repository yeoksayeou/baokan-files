Title: Cars Can't Climb Hills Anymore

　　Once you enter the Aoshan mining area of the Nanshan Iron Mine, which is part of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, you can see a row of four light railway tracks extending from the foot of the mountain deep towards the summit. A series of small ore cars loaded with ore crawl up the tracks. These four light railway tracks are called self-weight cable car tracks, totaling 360 meters in length. They utilize the natural slope of the mountain, using a steel cable as traction. When the ore cars loaded with ore descend, the self-weight of the descending cars pulls the empty cars up the mountain. Wang Weifa, a cable car worker, told us: With the self-weight cable car, it only takes 45 minutes to transport the ore each trip, and each time it can transport more than three tons of ore. One self-weight cable car line can transport 500 tons of ore per day.

　　We walked more than two kilometers along the ring road around the mountain and did not see a single transport truck along the way. It turns out that road transport here has been replaced by self-weight cable cars and chutes.

　　At a terraced mining face, we watched the scene of chute transport. This mining face is more than 140 meters above the ground. A flat road for trucks has been opened around the mining face. After the trucks transport the ore to the edge of the working face and unload it, the ore flows down the hillside to another terraced working face below. At this working face, it is loaded onto trucks again and transported to the edge of the working face, and then the ore is allowed to flow down the hillside again. This relay-style transport avoids the need for trucks to climb up and down the mountain slopes, allowing the trucks to always transport on flat roads. This reduces the wear and tear on the trucks and increases their utilization rate. In the past, when trucks climbed up and down mountain slopes, a new tire would wear out in less than a month. Now, a new tire can be used for more than six months.

　　Currently, the various mines of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company are vigorously promoting self-weight cable cars and chute transport. (Tang Tianzhen, Chen Chongfa)

    汽车不爬坡了
    一走进马鞍山钢铁公司南山铁矿凹山铁矿场，就可以看到一排四条轻便铁轨从山脚一直深向山顶，一列列装运矿石的小矿车，沿着铁轨向上爬动。这四条轻便铁轨叫自重挂线车轨道，全长三百六十米。它是利用山的自然坡度，以一条钢丝绳作牵引，在载满矿石的矿车下山的时候，借矿车下山的自重，把山下的空车带上山。挂线车工王为发对我们说：有了自重挂线车，矿车运一趟只要四十五分钟，每次可运矿石三吨多；一条自重挂线车路，每天可以运矿石五百吨。
    我们沿着环山公路走了两公里多，沿途改有见到一辆运输汽车，原来这里的公路运输已被自重挂线车和溜槽运输代替了。
    在一个台阶采矿工作面，我们观看了溜槽运输的情景。这个采矿工作面离地面一百四十多米，围绕采矿工作面已开拓出了一条平坦的汽车路，汽车把矿石运到工作面的边缘卸下以后，矿石就沿着山坡流到山下另一个台阶工作面。在这个工作面上，再装车运到工作面的边缘，然后又让矿石沿山坡流下去。这种接力式的运输，避免了汽车上下爬山坡，使汽车始终在平路上运输。这样就减少了汽车的损耗，提高了汽车的使用率。过去，汽车上下爬山坡，一部新轮胎用不到一个月就磨破了，现在一部新轮胎可以使用六个月以上。
    现在，马鞍山钢铁公司各矿场都在大力推广自重挂线车和溜槽运输。（汤天真、陈崇发）
