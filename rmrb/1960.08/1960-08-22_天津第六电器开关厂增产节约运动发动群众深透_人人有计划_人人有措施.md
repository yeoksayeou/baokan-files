Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 21st. After completing the year's Great Leap Forward plan ahead of schedule in early July, the Tianjin No. 6 Electrical Switch Factory, with a spirit of continuous revolution, is advancing victoriously. They mobilized the masses to summarize their experiences and formulated an even greater leap forward production plan for the remaining five months of this year based on a solid and reliable foundation.

This factory used to be a small factory that could only produce bakelite parts before last year. Last year, due to adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, the entire factory's employees established lofty ambitions, and production climbed to new heights again and again, becoming an advanced collective in the Hebei Province industrial system. This year, the entire factory has been vigorously engaged in technological revolution, transforming most manual operations into mechanization and semi-mechanization, greatly increasing production efficiency. The entire factory completed the annual state plan ahead of schedule on July 5th, and has developed from only producing bakelite parts to being able to produce twenty kinds of products.

In mid-July, the entire factory's employees summarized their experience in successfully completing various plans in the first half of the year. Through discussions and free airing of views, they analyzed and studied issues such as how to further improve product quality and output, increase new products, solve raw materials, and tap production potential in the remaining five months, and proposed solutions. For example, in terms of solving raw material supply and reducing consumption, the employees believed that the experience of vigorously engaging in product revolution and recycling leftover materials from fraternal factories in the first half of the year should continue to be promoted. While discussing, the workers dissected and tested all products. By the end of July, eighteen kinds of products had been reformed. These products generally achieved small size, low material consumption, good quality, and high efficiency. After the button switch was revolutionized, the number of parts was reduced from one hundred and sixty-one to sixty-five, and the amount of bakelite powder required for each switch was reduced from five hundred grams to one hundred and sixty-one grams. The volume is only one-third of the old product, and the performance fully meets the requirements. These innovative measures by the factory workers can save a lot of bakelite powder, copper, silver, thin iron sheets, aluminum, and other raw materials in the remaining five months of this year. With these raw materials, many more products can be produced. In terms of improving product quality, the workers proposed that the key lies in vigorously developing molds and improving mold quality, based on the experience accumulated in the previous months. In terms of further tapping production potential, veteran worker Xu Caide and others suggested vigorously developing special equipment. After testing, the work of manufacturing square shafts, the main components of transfer switches, was changed from general lathes to special lathes for production, greatly increasing efficiency. The more than three thousand square shafts required each month originally took half a month to produce, but now it only takes two days.

After discussion, the entire factory's employees put forward two hundred suggestions and specific measures for the sustained leap forward in the remaining five months of this year. The entire factory revised the original plan and formulated a larger leap forward plan for the remaining five months of this year, and distributed the revised plan to the workshops. Each workshop formulated monthly, ten-day, and daily production schedule plans, and implemented the plans and measures down to the groups and each worker, so that the plan was both advanced and practical and reliable.

At the same time, based on the experience of the previous seven months, the factory further summarized the enterprise management work, making the management work fully aligned with the current mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy. They implemented a six-point working method: in the first half of the month, focus on a good start, focus on component assembly production, and focus on key and measures for completing the monthly plan; in the second half of the month, focus on the next month's plan arrangements, focus on the preparation of raw material supply for the next month, and focus on the implementation of various production measures for the next month. For example, the production plan for August was formulated in mid-July and distributed to the groups. After discussion, the group workers formulated guarantee measures aimed at the key to production and established a ten-day and daily schedule plan, with both the date of implementation and specific personnel responsible for the measures. After July 20th, they began to produce parts for August products. The workers formulated plans for a good start for the first three days of August based on the August plan, prepared parts, overhauled machinery and equipment, and made all preparations. Therefore, finished products were produced on August 1st, changing the old routine of rushing components in the first half of the month and rushing finished products in the second half of the month. Now, they have also formulated the production plan for September. According to this plan, the factory's planned output of electrical switches in September will be much higher than the highest output in July this year, and the quality will also strive to be the first in Hebei Province, and some indicators will also strive to be the first in the country.

    天津第六电器开关厂增产节约运动发动群众深透
    人人有计划  人人有措施
    新华社天津21电　天津市第六电器开关厂在7月初提前完成全年跃进计划以后，又以不断革命的精神乘胜前进，发动群众总结经验，在切实可靠的基础上制订了今年后五个月的更大跃进的生产计划。
    这个厂去年以前还是一个只能生产电木配件的小厂。去年由于坚持政治挂帅，全厂职工树立了雄心大志，生产一再攀登高峰，成为河北省工业系统中的先进集体。今年全厂大搞技术革命，把大部分手工操作改成了机械化和半机械化，生产效率成倍提高，全厂在7月5日就提前完成了全年国家计划，并由只生产电木配件，发展到能生产二十种产品。
    7月中旬，全厂职工总结了上半年出色完成各项计划的经验，并且通过座谈鸣放，对后五个月如何进一步提高产品质量和产量、增加新产品、解决原材料以及挖掘生产潜力等问题，逐个进行了分析研究，提出了解决办法。例如，在解决原料材料供应和降低消耗方面，职工们认为上半年大搞产品革命和回收兄弟厂下角料的经验应该继续推广。工人们一面讨论，一面解剖试验所有产品，到7月底就改革了十八种产品。这些产品普遍作到了体积小、用料少、质量好、效率高。按钮开关经过革命以后，由一百六十一个部件减少到六十五个，每个开关所需要的电木粉由五百克降低到一百六十一克，体积只相当于老产品的三分之一，效能完全合乎要求。全厂工人的这些革新措施，可以使今年后五个月节约大量电木粉、铜、白银、薄铁板、铝等原料材料；用这些原料材料，就可以增产很多产品。在提高产品质量方面，工人们根据前几个月积累的经验，提出关键在于大搞模具，提高模具质量。在进一步挖掘生产潜力方面，老工人许才德等建议大搞专用设备，经过试验，把制造转换开关主要部件方轴的工作，由一般车床改用专用车床生产以后，效率大增，每月所需要的三千多个方轴，原来需要半个月生产，现在只要两天就够了。
    全厂职工经过讨论，为今年后五个月的持续跃进提出了二百项建议和具体措施。全厂重新修改了原来的计划，制订了今年后五个月的更大跃进计划，并把修改的计划下达到车间。各车间都按月、按旬、按日制订了生产进度计划，把计划、措施一直落实到小组和每个工人，这样就使计划既先进又切实可靠。
    在这同时，工厂还根据前七个月的经验，进一步总结了企业管理工作，使管理工作和当前的增产节约群众运动完全合拍。他们实行了六抓工作方法：上半月抓开门红，抓部件配套生产，抓完成本月计划的关键和措施；下半月抓下月计划安排，抓下月原料材料供应的准备工作，抓下月生产的各项措施落实。例如，8月份的生产计划就在7月中旬制订出来，并且下达到小组，小组工人经过讨论以后，针对生产关键制订出保证措施，按旬、按日订立进度计划，措施中既有实现日期，又有专人负责。到7月20日以后，就开始生产8月份的产品部件，工人们又根据8月份计划制订8月份前三天的开门红计划，备好部件，检修好机器设备，作好一切准备工作。因此，8月1日就出产了成品，一改过去上半月突击部件，下半月突击成品的旧常规。现在，他们又制定出了9月份的生产计划。根据这一计划，全厂9月份电器开关的产量计划，将比今年产量最高的7月份还高很多，质量也要争取在河北省第一，有些指标还要在全国争第一。
