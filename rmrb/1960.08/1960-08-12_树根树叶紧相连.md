党委书记手记: Party Committee Secretary's Notes

    Roots and Leaves Closely Linked
    Zhao Huailiang, Secretary of the CCP Committee of Anyang Machine Tool Factory, Henan

    We added a big sign at the entrance of our factory, which reads: "Machine Tool Factory Supports Agricultural Repair Stations." Since the sign was put up, it has become even more lively than before. Communes send people to repair their machinery day and night in an endless stream. We repair machinery for the communes in our spare time, but we truly ensure that no one is turned away and that all requests are met. The workers all compete with each other, tackling difficulties head-on, not caring about time or pay. Everyone says: What supporting or not supporting, this is our own business!

    One day, the Lücun Commune sent two gas engines that needed repair. After they placed the gas engines at the factory entrance, they went to the factory to complete the formalities. After finishing the formalities, they looked at the entrance and the machines were gone. It was noon that day, and everyone was eating lunch. We figured that the things couldn't be lost, and that some workshop must have moved them. So we asked the guests to have lunch while we sent someone to look for them in the workshops. Sure enough, we found them in the Fifth Workshop. It turned out that Section Chief Guo Wengong had directed the workers to move the gas engines to the machine repair section. The guests were a bit worried about their "lost" items, so they hurriedly finished their meal and looked at the entrance. Both gas engines were repaired, and several workers were loading them onto the truck.

    "Every person should do at least one good deed for agricultural technical transformation!" This slogan put forward by the factory Party committee was warmly and sincerely welcomed by all the factory's employees.

    One evening, the agricultural support shock team of the Third Workshop was working hard to assemble a comprehensive universal machine tool. The fervor was indescribable. Even when I stood there for a long time, no one noticed me. An old worker in his fifties said while assembling: "If agriculture doesn't develop, what will you eat? The factory won't be able to start work either!" Another young worker said: "We workers and peasants are one family. If you ask me, this isn't support, it's our own business!"

    "Absolutely right, but it's time to rest now!" I knew that everyone had put in a lot of effort to assemble this machine tool, and this shock team had not rested properly for two days and nights. When I spoke, everyone realized I was standing there.

    The crowd shouted: "Secretary, if this machine tool isn't assembled well, do you think we can sleep?" The old worker did not stop working, and continued to talk: "Our universal machine tool is of great significance. It can drill, plane, turn, and mill. It's convenient, flexible, and the materials are all found in the waste pile..."

    I interrupted him: "No matter what you say, it's time to rest!" Just as I was saying this, the branch secretary of this workshop, Old Chen, arrived. After much persuasion, we finally managed to mobilize the people of this shock team to leave.

    Next, I went to the Fourth Workshop to see the night shift workers assembling diesel engines. The work was progressing quickly, and everywhere there was the sound of "Put! Put! Put!" testing the engines. Looking at the watch, it was only a little past twelve o'clock, and eight units had already been assembled. By eight o'clock in the morning, at least four more units could be assembled. I went to the Third Workshop, where the universal machine tools were being assembled, and it was already time to get off work, but the workers had not left. I deliberately raised my voice to criticize them: "Why are you still here? You all have to leave immediately!" Everyone replied: "We're all leaving right away!" At this time, a young worker who looked a bit mischievous picked up a large red paper and began to read: "Dear Party Committee: To support agriculture in fighting drought, the workers are all vanguards, fighting for the universal machine tool, manufacturing it successfully in two days. The Party's leadership is brilliant, and our workers have made another contribution. Special report to the Party Committee!..." I took the good news report, and was very excited. Unexpectedly, there was drumming and gonging everywhere, and they were all reporting good news. I received seven good news reports in a row: High-pressure water pump trial production success, over-fulfillment of the drilling cone production task, three women successfully assembled a cotton picking machine...

    Back in my office-cum-dormitory, I couldn't fall asleep, thinking over and over, lost in thought. Our machine tool factory, being able to develop from "a few workers, a few hammers, and a brazier making revolution" to today's situation, isn't this a victory of the great principle of taking agriculture as the foundation? Every step forward in agriculture is a step forward for the factory. The facts are the best proof: Before 1952, our factory was just a small repair shop with only one brazier and a dozen workers. At that time, we couldn't even produce a screw. With the great victory of land reform and the high tide of agricultural cooperativization in 1955, the factory could manufacture double-wheeled double-share plows and heavy waterwheels. In 1958, the people's commune rose like the rising sun, emitting boundless light. Agricultural production achieved unprecedented development. All of our factory's double-wheeled double-share plows and waterwheels were sold out within a few days. Agriculture leaps forward, and our factory also soars, from producing waterwheels to producing precision lathes, planers, large lathes, and diesel engines. Now we have several modern workshops. Isn't this a victory of taking agriculture as the foundation? If anyone says that taking agriculture as the foundation will reduce the speed of industrial development, then please come and see the vivid facts of our factory!

    Since 1958, in addition to completing our own production tasks, we have also repaired more than 5,000 large machines for the countryside, trained more than 300 commune industrial backbones for eight counties and cities, and equipped two commune machinery factories with one to two hundred people. Many of the facts of the workers' support for agriculture are very moving. One worker went home on a seven-day vacation and served as a technical guide at the commune factory for seven days, staying in the factory from morning to night. During the most tense time of drought resistance this year, workers used their spare time to repair farm implements in nearby fields, ensuring the normal operation of all pumping machines and diesel engines in several communes. When they were hungry, they nibbled on the cold steamed buns they had brought with them. If anyone asks why we are so enthusiastic about supporting agriculture, I think the reason is very simple: without the development of agriculture, there will be no leap in industry. An old worker put it well: "Roots and leaves are closely linked, workers and peasants are like brothers, if the roots are not thick, the leaves will not be lush, and if agriculture leaps forward, industry can develop greatly." Isn't this the case?

    树根树叶紧相连
    中共河南安阳机床厂委员会书记　赵怀亮
    我们厂门口增加了一块大牌子，上面写着：“机床厂支援农业修配站。”牌子一挂，比以前可更热闹了。各公社来修配机具的，白天黑夜，络绎不绝。我们为公社修配机具，都是放在业余时间，但却真正做到了来者不误，有求必应。工人们个个争先恐后，见困难就上，不计时间，不计报酬，大家说：什么支援不支援，这就是我们自己的事情嘛！
    一天，吕村公社送来两台需要修理的煤气机。他们把煤气机放到厂门口后，就到厂里办手续去了。办好手续，到门口一瞧，机器没有了。那天正是中午，大家都在吃午饭，我们估计东西怎么也丢不了，准是哪个车间给抬走了。于是我们就一面请客人吃中午饭，一面派人到车间去找，果然在五车间找到了。原来是郭文恭段长指挥工人把煤气机给拉到机修段去了。客人“丢了”东西总有点放心不下，匆匆地吃完饭，到门口一看，两台煤气机都修好了，几个工人正在给装车哩。
    “每人至少为农业技术改造办一件好事！”厂党委提出的这个口号，受到了全厂职工热烈而真诚的欢迎。
    一天晚上，三车间支援农业突击队正在紧张地装一台综合式万能机床，那个火热劲就不用提了。连我走到他们那儿去站了好一会，都没有人发觉。一个五十多岁的老工人边装边说：“农业不发展你吃个啥，工厂也别想开工了！”另一个青年工人说：“咱们工农是一家，要让我说，不是什么支援，这就是自己的事！”
    “完全对，不过这会儿该休息了！”我知道，为了装这台机床，大家费了不少的脑筋，这个突击队已经两昼夜没有好好休息了。我这一开口，大家才发觉我站在那儿。
    大伙嚷嚷着说：“书记呀，这台床子装不好，你想我们能睡得着觉吗？”那个老工人并没有停下手中的活，滔滔不绝地说：“我们这台万能机床，意义重大，它能钻，能刨，能车，能铣，又方便，又灵巧，材料还都是咱们从废料堆里找来的……”
    我打断了他的话：“不管你怎样说，也该去休息了！”正说着，这个车间的支部书记老陈来了。我们好说歹说，才算把这个突击队的人动员走了。
    接着，我又到四车间去看夜班工人装配柴油机的情况。工作进行得很快，到处都是“突！突！突！”的试车声，一看表才十二点过一点，已经装好八台了，到早上八点钟，至少可以再装成四台。我又到装配万能机床的三车间一看，已经到了下班的时候，工人们都还没有走。我有意地放大声音批评他们：“你们怎么还在这里，全都得马上走！”大家都回答说：“我们马上全都走！”这时，一个看起来有点调皮的青年工人，拿起一张大红纸，开口念起来了：“亲爱的党委：支援农业抗旱，工人个个打先锋，奋战万能机床，两天制造成功，党的领导英明，咱工人又立一功。特向党委报喜！……。”我接过喜报，心里非常激动。不料一会儿到处敲锣打鼓，都报喜来了。我一连就接了七张喜报：高压水泵试制成功，赶制钻井锥超额完成生产任务，三个女将装成一台扒棉花机……
    回到我办公兼宿舍的地方，怎样也不能入睡，思前想后，浮想联翩。咱们这个机床厂，能够从“几个工人几把锤，一盘烘炉闹革命”发展到今天的局面，不正是以农业为基础的伟大方针的胜利吗？农业每向前发展一步，厂子也向前发展一步，事实是最好的证明：1952年以前，我们厂还是一个只有一盘烘炉、十几个工人的小修配厂，那时连个螺丝钉都不能生产。随着土地改革的伟大胜利，和1955年农业合作化高潮的到来，工厂可以制造双轮双铧犁和重型水车了。1958年人民公社似旭日东升，发出万丈光芒，农业生产得到了空前未有的大发展，我们厂所有的那些双轮双铧犁和水车，几天之内就卖得精光。农业向前飞跃，我们厂也展翅高飞，从生产水车，发展到生产精密的车床、刨床、大型车床、柴油机，现在已经拥有好几个现代化车间。这不是以农业为基础的胜利是什么。如果谁要说农业为基础会降低工业的发展速度，那就请来看看我们厂的生动事实吧！
    1958年以来，我们除完成自己的生产任务外，还为农村修理大型机具五千多台，为八个县市培训了三百余名公社工业骨干，并装备了两个拥有一二百人的公社机械厂。工人们支援农业中很多事实是非常令人感动的。有个工人回家休假七天，到公社工厂当了七天技术指导，每天从早到晚，一直呆在厂子里边。在今年抗旱最紧张的时候，工人们在业余时间，到附近田间修理农具，保证了几个公社所有的抽水机、柴油机正常工作。他们饿了，就啃几口自己带去的冷馒头。如果有人要问：我们支援农业的劲头为什么这样大，我看道理很简单，没有农业的发展，就没有工业的飞跃。有个老工人说得好：“树根树叶紧相连，工人农民手足般，树干不粗叶不茂，农业跃进工业就能大发展。”事实难道不正是如此吗？
