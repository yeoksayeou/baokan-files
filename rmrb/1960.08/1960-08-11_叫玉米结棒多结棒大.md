Make Corn Develop More Cobs and Bigger Cobs
Wang Baojing Wang Baoxue Ma Shuxiu

Summer corn has passed the seedling stage and entered the period of young ear differentiation. Grasp this stage well, and do everything possible to make the corn stalks strong and the young ears differentiate well, so as to lay a good foundation for each corn plant to produce more cobs and bigger cobs.

Empty Stalks Are Not Incurable Diseases, Single Ears Are Not Necessarily Due to Dense Planting

To achieve high yields and abundant harvests of summer corn, from now on, we must pay attention to eliminating empty stalks and turning single cobs into double cobs. Eliminating empty stalks and having one stalk produce multiple cobs is a very complex issue. Some people believe that empty corn stalks are an incurable disease and cannot be saved; that it is a "congenital condition" that cannot be cured. These people are wrong. In our area, there were indeed many empty stalks in the cornfields in the past, one or two out of every hundred plants; but now there are very few, no more than two or three out of every hundred plants. Due to poor cultivation techniques, corn may have a "congenital condition" of being inadequate from the start. However, as long as we actively think of ways: if it is a water problem, we start with water; if it is a fertilizer problem, we treat it with fertilizer; if the management is not meticulous, we manage it meticulously, and the problem can be solved.

There are some people who, although they do not believe that empty stalks and single ears of corn are incurable diseases, completely blame this phenomenon on dense planting. They say: the abundance of empty stalks and the scarcity of double cobs are caused by the disaster of dense planting. Some even want to use sparse planting to achieve the goal of each corn plant producing double cobs and bigger cobs. Sparsely planted corn certainly has good ventilation and light, strong stalks, big ears, and fewer empty stalks; but because there are very few plants, the yield per unit area decreases significantly. Naturally, leaving the corn seedlings too crowded will also cause mutual shading, hinder ventilation and light, prevent the roots from taking hold, and prevent nutrients and water from being transported up, resulting in thin stalks, small ears, and many empty stalks.

Now, the corn here generally has 2,500 to 3,500 plants per mu on irrigated land, and there is no excessive density of plants. Our planting team once planted a high-yield corn plot with 3,600 plants per mu, with less than two empty stalks per hundred corn plants, and more than half of the plants produced double or triple cobs. In a comparison plot with less than 2,000 plants per mu, there were 20 to 30 empty stalks per hundred plants, with an average of only 0.79 cobs per plant. It can be seen that the abundance of empty stalks and single ears is not caused by reasonable dense planting.

The Key Lies in Appropriate Promotion and Control

According to our years of exploration, the main reasons for empty stalks and single ears of corn are as follows: First, insufficient water and fertilizer. Corn likes water and fertilizer, especially during the young ear differentiation period, which requires growing conditions with abundant fertilizer and water. As farmers often say: "Lack of fertilizer leads to more single cobs, and drought leads to empty stalks." This is the reason. Second, damage from pests and diseases. When corn is harmed, nutrients cannot be transported to the young ears, and the female ears will not grow well. Third, poor ventilation and light affect the normal development of female ears.

The above are the superficial phenomena that cause empty stalks and single ears of corn, but tracing the root cause, it is that field management work has not been done well, that is, fertilizing when it should be fertilized, watering when it should be watered, not providing light when it needs light, and not grasping disease prevention, pest control, and lodging prevention early.

How can we eliminate empty stalks and make each corn plant produce double cobs and bigger cobs? Our approach is to do a good job in the field management stage, passing the five stages of seedling, ear differentiation, flowering, grain filling, and maturity. These five stages have common goals and different tasks. The common goal is to eliminate empty stalks, produce more cobs, produce bigger cobs, have full and heavy grains, and achieve high yields. The different tasks of each stage are: the seedling stage strives for full, vigorous, and strong seedlings; the young ear differentiation stage mainly calls for fast ear differentiation, differentiating one, and making one succeed; the flowering stage is to try to make all the silks emerge and receive pollen well; the focus of the grain filling stage is to strive for big ears, full grains, and heavy grains; the maturity stage is all for early maturity. These five stages are a relationship of "you help me, and I promote you," and they are all very important. We must tightly control each stage and not let one go.

At present, we must seize the opportunity to pass the ear differentiation stage well. This is a critical period for determining whether the corn will have empty stalks, and whether it will be single or double cobs. If this stage is passed well, the young ears will differentiate quickly and well, which will make the tassels emerge quickly and well, and the silks emerge quickly, well, and receive pollen well.

Strengthen Management According to New Circumstances

To pass the corn ear differentiation stage, flowering stage, and grain filling stage well, we must actively carry out promotion work according to the new circumstances this year.

The new circumstance this year is that there has been very little rain since the beginning of summer, summer corn was planted late, and corn seedlings have congenital deficiencies. If management is poor, they are likely to age prematurely, resulting in many empty stalks, single ears, and small inferior ears. How should we "promote" corn in light of the new circumstances? The focus is still on water, fertilizer, and management. Irrigation should be based on the weather, the land, and the corn, and fertilization should be timely, appropriate, and suitable. Watching the weather, if it still does not rain during the ear differentiation period, we should irrigate more water. Under normal circumstances, one irrigation of 20 to 30 cubic meters of water is sufficient during the young ear differentiation period, but if it is dry, we should appropriately increase the amount. Watching the land, if the soil can be formed into mud balls by hand within one or two days after irrigation, we will not irrigate again; otherwise, if it is very loose, we should irrigate continuously. Watching the corn, if the leaves curl when exposed to the sun, it means that there is insufficient water and we need to irrigate again; otherwise, if the leaves do not curl, we do not need to irrigate again. Timely fertilization means applying fertilizer to the "joints" where the corn needs it most, so that it can "see the vegetables under the knife" and take effect immediately. Appropriate amount means not giving too much and not giving too little. Suitable means giving what kind of fertilizer is needed. In terms of methods, we use whatever works quickly. Irrigation should be light and frequent. Fertilization should be done by ditching and fertilizing, and fertilizing around the roots, so that the fertilizer efficiency can be fully utilized. If the above principles are mastered and used well, it can play a promoting role in the healthy growth of corn, and all unfavorable factors can be turned into favorable conditions. The physiological defects brought about by the congenital deficiencies of corn can be quickly compensated for, so as to achieve the goal of producing more cobs and bigger cobs.

In short, eliminating empty stalks and making each corn plant produce as many cobs as possible is a problem in corn yield increase that has not yet been well resolved. However, the road is made by people, and as long as everyone comes up with ideas and thinks of ways, we will definitely be able to solve this problem.

    叫玉米结棒多结棒大
    王保京　王保学　马书秀
    夏玉米已经过了幼苗关，进入幼穗分化时期。抓好这一关，千方百计让玉米秆壮、幼穗分化好，就能为株株玉米多结棒、结大棒打好底子。
    空秆不是绝症  单穗别怪密植
    要夏玉米高产多收，从现在起，就要注意消灭空秆，变单棒为双棒。消灭空秆，一秆结多棒是一个很复杂的问题。有些人认为玉米空秆是绝症，没法救；是“胎里的症”没法治。这些人的看法是不对的。在我们这里，过去玉米地里的空秆的确很多，一百株中就有一、二十株；如今却很少了，一百株中也不过两三株。由于栽培技术不好，玉米可能有先天不足的“胎里症”。但是，只要积极想办法：是水症，从水上下手；是肥症，从肥上治；是管理不细，就细管，问题就能解决。
    有那么一些人，虽然不认为玉米的空秆、单穗是绝症，但他们却把这种现象完全归罪于密植。说什么：空秆多，双棒少是招了密植的祸。有的甚至想用稀植的办法达到株株玉米结双棒、结大棒的目的。稀植的玉米，固然通风透光好，秆壮、穗大、空秆少；可是由于株数很少，单位面积产量显著下降。自然，把玉米苗留得过稠，也会造成互相荫蔽，妨碍通风透光，根扎不好，养分水分送不上去，会产生秆细、穗小、空秆多的现象。
    现在，这里的玉米一般水地每亩留苗两千五百株到三千五百株上下，并没有发生植株过密现象。我们种植小组曾经种了一块丰产玉米，每亩留苗三千六百株，每百株玉米中不到两个空秆，结双棒、三棒的在一半以上。一块对比田，每亩不到二千株，每百株有二、三十个空秆，平均每株只有零点七九个棒子。可见，空秆多、单穗多不是合理密植造成的。
    关键在于促进、控制两适当
    根据我们几年来的摸索，造成玉米空秆和单穗的主要原因有以下三方面。第一是水肥不足。玉米喜水又喜肥，尤其到了幼穗分化期，更需要肥大水足的生长条件。庄稼人常说的：“缺肥单棒多，天旱出空秆。”就是这个道理。其次是受了病虫危害。玉米受了害，营养物质输送不到幼穗上去，雌穗就长不好。第三、通风透光不好，影响雌穗正常发育。
    以上是造成玉米空秆和单棒多的表面现象，但追其根子，还是田间管理工作没有做好，这也就是该施肥的时候不施肥，该浇水的时候不浇水，要光不给光，防病、防虫、防倒伏没早抓。
    怎样才能消灭空秆，使株株玉米结双棒，结大棒？我们的做法是在田间管理这一阶段中，要过好幼苗、穗分化、开花、灌浆、成熟五关。这五关有共同的目标，也有各自不同的任务。共同的目标是消灭空秆，多结棒，结大棒，粒饱粒重，产量高。各关不同的任务是：幼苗关力争苗全、苗旺、苗壮；幼穗分化关，主要叫穗分化快，分一个，成一个；开花关是尽力让所有花丝吐出，受好粉；灌浆关的中心是争取穗大、粒饱、粒重；成熟关是一切为了早熟。这五关是“你帮我，我促你”的关系，都很重要。要关关把紧，一关不放。
    眼前要抓紧过好穗分化关。这是决定玉米有没有空秆，是单棒还是双棒的关键时期。这一关过好了，幼穗分化得快，分化得好，才有可能使天花出得快、出得好，花丝吐得快、吐得好、受粉好。
    根据新情况加强管理
    要过好玉米穗分化关、开花关、灌浆关，就要根据今年新情况，积极进行促进工作。
    今年的新情况是入夏以来雨水很少，夏玉米种得迟，玉米苗先天不足，如果管理不善，很有可能未老先衰，空秆、单穗、小劣穗多。照新情况怎样给玉米“促进”呢？中心还是水、肥、管。灌水要看天、看地、看玉米，施肥要适时、适量、适性。看天，在穗分化期，如果天仍没有下雨，就多灌些水。在正常情况，幼穗分化期一次灌二、三十方水就行了，天旱时就适当加多一些。看地，灌水后一、两天内，土能用手握成泥蛋的就不再灌，反之，很松散，就要连着灌。看玉米，叶子见了太阳晒就卷，是水分不足，需要再灌；反之，不卷叶，就不用再灌水。施肥适时，是要把肥施到玉米正需要的“骨节眼”上，叫它“刀下见菜”，马上发挥作用。适量，是要多不给少，要少不给多。适性，是要啥肥给啥肥。在方法上，啥见效快用啥。灌水要轻浇、勤浇。施肥要开沟施肥、围根施肥，这样能充分发挥肥效。上边的这些原则掌握得好，用得好，对玉米健壮生长就能起到促进作用，一切不利因素都可以变成有利条件，玉米先天不足所带来的生理缺陷，都能很快补起来，达到多结棒、结大棒的目的。
    总之，消灭空秆，让一株玉米上尽可能多结棒，是玉米增产中一个还没有很好解决的问题。但是，路是人走出来的，只要大家出主意，想办法，一定能解决这个问题。
