    Unbreakable Friendship
    — Remembering the Warm Welcome Received by the Chinese Delegation in Japan

    From the very first minute of arriving at Haneda Airport on July 29th, every member of the Chinese delegation strongly felt that this visit had further enhanced the fighting friendship built between the people of China and Japan in their struggle against the common enemy, US imperialism. Although the delegation arrived in Tokyo at dusk, Haneda Airport was a sea of red flags, like being illuminated by the rising sun. In this sea, tens of thousands of excited faces flashed, expressing sincere friendship to the delegation, and the loud song of "Tokyo - Beijing" rose and fell. Mr. Ikuo Yasui shook hands warmly with head of the delegation Liu Ningyi and said intimately, "It's been such a long wait to finally see our Chinese friends!" Leaving the welcoming crowd, the delegation drove along the wide road from Haneda to Tokyo. En route, the Japanese friends accompanying the delegation pointed out with great kindness the Benten Bridge Square and the Shinagawa Station of the "June 4th General Strike," where U.S. President Eisenhower's advance man Hagerty had lost his nerve, introducing the heroic deeds of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle to the delegation. Pointing to Benten Bridge, Yasui Ikuo said to Liu Ningyi that it was the place where the Japanese people showed Hagerty what's what. At that time, surrounded by angry masses, Hagerty had to climb a rope ladder like a monkey performing a stunt and escape by helicopter. Similarly, when Kishi Nobusuke went to the United States to sign the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, he had to sneak into Haneda Airport through side roads out of fear of the people's opposition. Neither of them dared to take this main road directly to downtown Tokyo. Today, the Chinese delegation drove along this main road to Tokyo in a grand procession amidst the warm welcome of the Japanese people. Therefore, this road should be renamed "People's Avenue." Liu Ningyi said that Mr. Yasui was right, this road is "No Thoroughfare" for imperialists and reactionaries.

    What is even more exciting is that the Japanese people, after twenty-two unified actions, have greatly strengthened their confidence in the struggle. They talk about the issue of U.S. imperialism being a paper tiger everywhere. The delegation had just arrived at the "Tokyu Hotel." Upon going upstairs, they saw a paper tiger, its head and tail swaying in the wind. A person in charge of "Sohyo" (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan) played with the head of the paper tiger and said with a smile, This is U.S. imperialism! This immediately caused a burst of laughter. People once again turned the topic to the Japanese people's victorious prevention of Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

    This victorious event is exciting news for the Chinese people who are fighting against U.S. imperialism's occupation of their territory, Taiwan, and for the Chinese people who have always regarded the Japanese people's victory as their own. These delightful stories inspired Vice-Chairman Zhao Puchu’s poetic inspiration, and he immediately wrote a passionate poem entitled “The Sea at Haneda Airport” and recited it to everyone:

    Having flown over the sea,
    We have come to the sea again.
    Over there is the blue water connecting to the sky,
    Over there is solitude,
    Over here is a surging of cheers.
    Thunderous applause, your harmony with my singing,
    Cheers and applause rising and falling.
    Hundreds of hands stretching out from all directions;
    “Welcome, Chinese brothers,
    It's been more than two years since we last met, this is truly unexpected joy.”
    Having flown over the sea,
    We have come to the sea again.
    At Haneda Airport,
    It is a sea of red flags,
    It is a sea of flowers,
    It is a sea of silver lights,
    It is a sea of songs,
    It is a sea of applause.
    In the sea of people,
    I forgot my own existence.
    An old man is fanning himself beside me,
    I still can't stop sweating.
    Please don't fan,
    Let the sweat flow like a river,
    Flow into your sea of enthusiasm.
    Japanese brothers,
    Thank you for your kindness.
    It is your victory
    That allows us to come.
    Carrying the friendship, respect, and care of 600 million people,
    We greet you, we cheer for you,
    Your heroic struggle has shaken the world.
    People all over the world support you,
    You will surely be able to break the ropes binding the American war chariot.
    Those who do not believe in the strength of the Japanese people,
    Come and take a look at the sea at Haneda Airport.
    It is this sea that made Hagerty put on a monkey show,
    It is this sea that made Eisenhower make a fool of himself,
    It is this sea that forced Kishi Nobusuke to step down,
    For the reactionaries, this sea is truly formidable.
    But ah, for the Chinese people, for the people of the world,
    It is such a great, beautiful
    Sea of peace, sea of friendship!

    In the past few days, friends from all walks of life in Japan have talked the most with the Chinese delegation about the mutual support between the people of China and Japan in their opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance and the anti-American struggle.

    On July 31, President of the Japan-China Friendship Association Jiichiro Matsumoto, Managing Director Seimin Miyazaki, and Secretary-General Toshizo Hasegawa held cordial talks with Vice-Chairman Zhao Anbo. Zhao Anbo said: The Japanese people's struggle against the new "Security Treaty," demanding the withdrawal of U.S. military bases and striving for national independence, has set a good example for peace-loving people all over the world. These struggles show that U.S. imperialism can be defeated, and the Japanese people's heroic struggle has inspired the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Japan-China Friendship Association has played an important role in promoting friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples and opposing the "Security Treaty," and the Chinese people express their admiration for this. Zhao Anbo pointed out that the people of China and Japan are facing a major enemy because the same U.S. imperialism is occupying Japan and occupying our territory, Taiwan.

    Jiichiro Matsumoto said: The fact that the Japanese people oppose the "Security Treaty" shows that they love peace. He firmly believes that with the joint efforts of the people of Japan and China, one day diplomatic relations between Japan and China will be normalized, and no force can stop this.

    Seimin Miyazaki said that the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance has had a good start. The biggest gain is that the people have increased their confidence in the struggle to prevent Eisenhower's visit to Japan and to oust Kishi Nobusuke, and they have a correct assessment of their own strength. This confidence will continue to play a huge role in the future patriotic and just struggles.

    Hasegawa specially mentioned that the films "Blessing," "Lin Zexu," and "Song of Youth," presented by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations, have been touring Japan. Many Japanese youth have seen their own struggle image in the film "Song of Youth."

    On August 2, Zhao Anbo and Sun Pinghua, deputy secretary-general of the delegation, also visited Akira Kazami, and they talked about the issue of opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance again. Akira Kazami said that after this struggle, a bright future has emerged in Japanese history, and no matter what kind of suppression they encounter in the future, the Japanese people will surely continue to advance victoriously.

### 切不断的友谊——记中国代表团在日本受到的热烈欢迎

    切不断的友谊
    ——记中国代表团在日本受到的热烈欢迎
    中国代表团的每个成员，从7月29日到达羽田机场的第一分钟起，就强烈地感到这次访问使中日两国人民在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中所建立起来的战斗友谊更加增进了一大步。尽管代表团到达东京已是黄昏时分，但羽田机场却是一片像在初升旭日照耀下的红旗海洋。在这海洋里，闪动着成千上万幅激动的面孔向代表团表达诚挚的友情，嘹亮的“东京——北京”的歌声此起彼伏。安井郁先生和刘宁一团长热烈地握手并亲密地喊道：“好容易把中国朋友盼来了！”代表团离开了欢迎的人群，驱车在宽敞的马路上从羽田向东京驰去。途中，陪同代表团的日本朋友、亲切地特别指点曾使美国总统先行官哈格蒂失魂落魄的弁天桥广场和“六·四总罢工”的品川车站，向代表团介绍日本人民反美爱国斗争的英雄事迹。安井郁指着弁天桥向刘宁一说，那就是日本人民给哈格蒂颜色看的地方，当时哈格蒂在愤怒的群众的包围下，只好像猴子表演杂技一样爬上软梯乘直升飞机逃走；同样，岸信介在去美国签订日美军事同盟条约时，也因畏惧人民的反对而不得不从小路偷偷地溜进羽田机场，他们都不敢走这条直通东京市内的大马路。今天，中国代表团在日本人民热烈欢迎的浩浩荡荡的行列中从这条大路驶向东京。因此这条马路应该改名叫“人民大道”。刘宁一说，安井先生说得很正确，这条大路对帝国主义和反动派来讲，是“此路不通”。
    更令人兴奋的是，日本人民经过二十二次统一行动，
  已经大大地加强了斗争的信心。他们到处谈论着美帝国主义是纸老虎的问题。代表团刚刚到“东急旅馆”，一上楼就看到了一只用纸糊成的老虎，它头尾迎风摇动。一位“总评”的负责人用手玩弄着纸老虎的头部笑着说，这就是美帝国主义！这句话立即引起了哄堂的笑声。人们再次把话题转到日本人民胜利地阻止了艾森豪威尔访日的问题上。
    这个胜利的事迹对于为反对美帝国主义侵占自己领土台湾的中国人民来说，对一直把日本人民的胜利看成是自己的胜利的中国人民来说，是令人兴奋的佳话。这些佳话使赵朴初副团长的诗兴大发，他即席写了一首热情洋溢的诗，题为“羽田机场上的海”，并向大家朗诵道：
    飞过了大海，
    又来到了大海。
    那边是碧水连天，
    那边是寂寥，
    这边是欢声澎湃。
    风驰雷动的鼓掌，你应我和的唱歌，
    此起彼伏的欢呼喝采。
    千百只手从四面八方伸过来；
    “欢迎啊，中国弟兄，
    两年多不见你们这真是喜从天外。”
    飞过了大海，
    又来到了大海。
    羽田机场上，
    是红旗的海，
    是鲜花的海，
    是银灯的海，
    是歌声的海，
    是掌声的海。
    在人群的海中，
    我忘记了自己的存在。
    一位老者在身旁打扇，
    我仍然止不住流汗。
    请不要搧吧，
    让汗水像河水一般流下来，
    流入你们的热情的大海。
    日本弟兄们，
    感谢你们的厚爱。
    是你们的胜利
    使我们能够来。
    携带着六亿人的友情、敬意和关怀，
    我们向你们问好，向你们欢呼，
    你们英勇的斗争震动了世界。
    全世界人民都支持你们，
    你们一定能够啊，扭断那缚在美国战车上的绑带。
    不信日本人民力量的人，
    且来看一看羽田机场上的海。
    是这个海曾使哈格蒂耍一次猴戏，
    是这个海曾使艾森豪威尔出尽丑态，
    是这个海迫使岸信介倒了台，
    对反动派，这个海真是厉害。
    可是啊，对中国人民，对世界人民，
    它却又是多么伟大的，美丽的
    和平之海，友好之海！
    这几天，日本各界朋友同中国代表团谈得最多的是中日两国人民在反对日美军事同盟和反美斗争中的互相支持问题。
    7月31日，日中友好协会会长松本治一郎、理事长宫崎世民和事务局长长谷川敏三同赵安博副团长进行了亲切的谈话。赵安博说：日本人民反对新“安全条约”、要求撤销美军基地和争取民族独立的斗争，给全世界爱好和平的人民作出了良好的榜样。这些斗争说明，美帝国主义是可以反掉的，日本人民的英勇斗争鼓舞了亚非和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动。而日中友好协会在促进日中人民友好、反对“安全条约”斗争中起了重要作用，中国人民对此表示钦佩。赵安博指出，中日两国人民都是大敌当前，因为占领日本和占领我国领土台湾的都是同一个美帝国主义。
    松本治一郎说：日本人民反对“安全条约”这一事实说明，他们是热爱和平的。他深信，在日中两国人民共同努力下，总有一天日中邦交会正常化，这是任何力量也阻挡不住的。
    宫崎世民说，日本人民反对日美军事同盟的斗争已经有了良好的开端，其中最大的收获是人民在阻止艾森豪威尔访日、把岸信介赶下台的斗争中增强了信心，对自己的力量有了正确的估计。这种信心，将在今后的爱国正义斗争中继续产生巨大作用。
    长谷川特别提到，中国对外文化协会赠给日中友协的“祝福”、“林则徐”、“青春之歌”等影片，已经在日本全国巡回演出，许多日本青年在“青春之歌”影片中看到了自己的斗争形象。
    8月2日，赵安博和代表团副秘书长孙平化还访问了风见章，又谈起反对日美军事同盟的问题。风见章说，经过这场斗争，日本的历史已经出现了光明的前途，今后不管遭到怎样的镇压，日本人民必定会继续胜利前进。
