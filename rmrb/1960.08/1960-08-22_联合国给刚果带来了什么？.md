What has the United Nations brought to the Congo? Here are the main facts of the past month or so:

One, as soon as the "UN forces" entered the Congo, they began to occupy the places guarded by the Congolese troops, who were resisting the Belgian army's aggression, disarmed the Congolese soldiers, and took control of the Congo's airports and ports.

Two, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and the American Bunch, acting in the name of the UN representative, have supported the secessionist activities of Moise Tshombe, the imperialist agent in Katanga, in many ways. Hammarskjöld had announced that the UN would never "protect civilian and military personnel representing the (Congolese) central government from reaching Katanga." Bunch declared that the Congolese government's plans to strengthen its authority over the entire Congo, including Katanga Province, would not receive the UN's "support."

Three, Bunch brazenly violated the sovereignty of the Congo, denying the Congolese government the power to maintain order in its own country, and even declared that only the "UN forces" were "responsible for the security of this country."

Four, Hammarskjöld insisted that the "basic unity" of the Congo was only possible "if the UN forces entered its entire territory," and clamored that the UN must "guarantee" the Congo's "democracy" and "protect" the so-called "spokespersons of all different political views" in the Congo.

Five, under the UN's protection, the number of Belgian aggressor troops in the Congo still far exceeds the number before it launched its aggression. Moreover, the "UN forces" have also issued a large number of UN armbands to Belgian paratroopers and spies to carry out criminal activities. On August 16, Congolese soldiers discovered a team of Belgian armed paratroopers disguised as "UN forces" at Leopoldville Airport. However, Hammarskjöld, who is directly responsible for this dirty deal, even slandered the Congolese government's just actions in exercising national sovereignty as "illegal actions."

Six, on August 18, the "UN forces" occupied Leopoldville Airport, dug trenches for defense, prohibited Congolese soldiers from entering, threatened to "shoot" at Congolese troops if necessary, and continued to reinforce Leopoldville, carrying out threats.

From these facts, one can only draw one conclusion: the United Nations is playing a colonialist role in the Congo. Hammarskjöld has become a faithful defender of colonial interests, and the American Bunch is the actual executor of colonial policies. Behind the fig leaf of the United Nations is none other than U.S. imperialism.

In the Congo, the United States not only already has huge colonial interests but also seeks to completely replace the Belgian colonialists. Following the "UN forces" are the monopoly capital of Wall Street. The American Detwiler's "Congo International Management Company" first proposed a fifty-year plan to plunder the Congo, and the "Truman Foundation" colluded with Tshombe to decide to invest 50 million US dollars in Katanga alone. U.S. Representative to the United Nations Lodge boasted that the UN's intervention in the Congo was "the most advanced and mature international effort in history." Why is Lodge so proud? According to the "Washington Post," doing so would make it "impossible to attach the label of colonialism" to the United States. However, Lodge and his ilk are rejoicing too early. Paper cannot wrap fire after all.

The UN's intervention in the Congo is formally based on Security Council Resolution of July 13. When the resolution was voted on, the representatives of Britain and France abstained, while the representative of the United States voted in favor. Many fair-minded opinions pointed out at the time that this Security Council resolution opened the door for U.S. imperialism to interfere in the Congo and set a bad precedent for violating the sovereignty of a newly independent country in the name of the United Nations. For fifteen years, countless historical facts have repeatedly proven that U.S. imperialism uses the United Nations as its tool of aggression. The notorious and shameful record is: the United States once used the guise of the United Nations to commit the towering crime of aggression against Korea, and to this day, the U.S. aggressor troops are still赖在南朝鲜. The United States once used the "United Nations" to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs and slander the Soviet Union; on December 9 last year, the United States once again started the voting machine of the United Nations General Assembly and passed the so-called "Hungarian Question" proposal. Recently, the United States has repeatedly sent spy planes to invade Soviet airspace, seriously threatening world peace, and has been condemned by the whole world; however, in the United Nations Security Council, the United States has vetoed the Soviet Union's accusations against the United States' aggression with a majority vote, sheltering its aggressive crimes. Not long ago, the United States manipulated the majority vote of the Security Council to reject Cuba's accusation against U.S. aggression. For eleven years, the United States has manipulated the United Nations to stubbornly and illegally deprive China of its seat and has repeatedly passed illegal proposals slandering Chinese aggression. Faced with these cold facts, how can people believe that the United Nations, which is still under the control of the United States, will uphold justice, and how can people believe that it will really help the struggle against colonialism? How can people not regard the Security Council's resolution on intervention in the Congo as another talisman for the U.S. robber's crimes?

The apologists of U.S. imperialism are trying to exonerate themselves by saying that the UN's intervention was at the request of the Congolese government. However, when it comes to the Congolese government's position, it cannot wash away the crimes of the United States at all. The Congolese government's request at that time was to ensure national independence and sovereignty and to stop the aggression of the Belgian colonialists. The Congolese government requested military and technical assistance from the United Nations. But now, in the name of the United Nations, a series of events that violate the sovereignty of the Congo have occurred. Not only have the old colonialists—the Belgian colonialists—not withdrawn, but new colonialists—the American colonialists—have also poured in. The American Bunch acts like an emperor emeritus. Isn't all this supposed to be the responsibility of U.S. imperialism?

The Congo was invaded by Belgian colonialists less than ten days after declaring its independence. This is an extremely severe threat and difficulty for this newborn republic. It is understandable that the Congolese government hoped that the United Nations would come forward to uphold justice. The Congolese government originally did not expect that the neocolonialists would so despicably take advantage of its good intentions and carry out new conquests under the banner of the United Nations. Now, one suffers a loss, one gains in wisdom. The neocolonialists' atrocities in the Congo have aroused the infinite indignation of the Congolese people.

The Congolese people are standing up stronger from suffering. The Congolese military and police in Leopoldville have taken up arms again to search for Belgian paratroopers and spies hiding in the UN forces and have counterattacked the provocations of those white troops who resisted inspection. This is a patriotic and just action that any self-respecting nation should take. In Luluabourg, Kasai Province, and in the towns of Kongolo, Manono, and Mulongo in Katanga Province, the Congolese people's struggle against the "UN forces" infringing upon sovereignty and the Belgian colonialists committing wrongdoing is rising. Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba has successively issued speeches and statements, strongly condemning UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld as an "accomplice in the secession of Katanga," condemning the white troops in the UN for insulting Congolese soldiers, "demanding the immediate withdrawal of white troops," and exposing that "the UN wants to replace the (Congolese) legitimate government and exercise power in the Congo." Lumumba said, "We do not want to replace Belgian occupation with UN occupation." This is a powerful answer to the neocolonialists.

At present, the Congolese people's struggle is not only related to the fate of the Congo but is also closely related to the fate of the people of African countries. As Guinean President Touré pointed out in a recent speech, "The struggle in the Congo is no longer just a struggle between the Congolese nationalist movement and the imperialists and colonialists. This is a struggle for Africa to achieve complete independence and enjoy its freedom extensively, against those who still want to oppress and exploit it." He called on all democratic forces in the world, including all independent African countries, to unite their forces to crush the imperialists' vicious plans against the young Congolese state.

At present, the Congolese people are facing a serious struggle against the new and old colonialists headed by the United States. The Congolese people, who have a glorious tradition of struggling for national independence, have not been subdued by the Belgian colonialists in the past, and now they will never be deceived and suppressed by U.S. imperialism. The entire world situation is conducive to the Congolese people's struggle. They have the support of the entire African people and the support of the people of the whole world. The Chinese people believe that although there are still various difficulties on the road forward, the Congolese people will eventually eliminate a small handful of national scum like Tshombe who serve the imperialist plot to split the Congo, strengthen unity, fight together, overcome all difficulties, and win the final victory in safeguarding independence and safeguarding the territorial sovereignty of the newborn Republic of the Congo. The Chinese people firmly stand on the side of the Congolese people, condemn the crimes of Belgian colonialists and U.S. imperialism under the guise of the United Nations in invading the Congo, and fully support the heroic struggle of the Congolese people.

### 联合国给刚果带来了什么？

    联合国给刚果带来了什么？
    联合国给刚果带来些什么？下面就是一个多月来的主要事实：
    一、“联合国军”一开进刚果，便着手占领刚果部队守卫着、并且抵抗着比利时军队侵略的地方，解除刚果士兵的武装，控制了刚果的机场和港口。
    二、联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和以联合国代表名义活动的美国人本奇，多方支持加丹加的帝国主义代理人冲伯的分裂活动。哈马舍尔德曾宣布，联合国绝不“保护代表（刚果）中央政府到达加丹加的民政和军事人员”。本奇宣称：刚果政府关于加强对包括加丹加省在内的整个刚果的权力的打算，将得不到联合国的“支持”。
    三、本奇狂妄地侵犯刚果的主权，否认刚果政府有维护本国秩序的权力，竟宣布只有“联合国军”“才对这个国家的安全负责”。
    四、哈马舍尔德硬说，刚果的“基本统一”，只有在“联合国军进入它的全境的情况下”才有可能，而且叫嚷，必须由联合国来“保障”刚果的“民主”，“保护”刚果的所谓“一切不同的政见的代言人”。
    五、在联合国的庇护下，直到现在，比利时侵略军在刚果的兵员还远远超过它发动侵略以前的人数。不仅如此，“联合国军”还把大批联合国的臂章发给比利时的伞兵和间谍人员，进行罪恶活动。8月16日，刚果士兵就在利奥波德维尔机场查出了一队化装为“联合国军”的比利时武装伞兵。可是，对于这一肮脏勾当直接负责的哈马舍尔德，竟然诬蔑刚果政府行使国家主权的正义行动为“非法行动”。
    六、8月18日“联合国军”占领利奥波德维尔的机场，掘壕据守，禁止刚果士兵进入，扬言必要时将对刚果军队“开枪”射击，并且继续增兵利奥波德维尔，进行威胁。
    从上面这些事实里，人们只能得出一个结论：联合国在刚果扮演着殖民主义的角色。哈马舍尔德成了殖民利益的忠实维护者，美国人本奇是殖民政策的实际执行人。曾在联合国的遮丑布后面的，不是别人，正是美帝国主义。
    在刚果，美国不仅已经拥有巨大的殖民利益，并且亟图完全取比利时殖民主义者的地位而代之。在“联合国军”之后，接踵而来的，就是华尔街的垄断资本。美国的德特威勒的“刚果国际管理公司”首先提出了掠夺刚果的五十年计划，“杜鲁门财团”又同冲伯勾结，决定单独在加丹加投资五千万美元。美国驻联合国代表洛奇吹嘘说，联合国对刚果的干涉，是“有史以来最先进最成熟的国际努力。”洛奇为什么这样得意呢？据“华盛顿邮报”透露，这样做，对美国就“不可能安上殖民主义的标记”。可是，洛奇之流高兴得未免太早了。纸终究是包不住火的。
    联合国对刚果的干涉，形式上是根据安全理事会7月13日的决议行事的。在表决这个决议案的当时，英国和法国的代表弃权，而美国的代表则投赞成票。不少公正的舆论当时就已经指出，安理会的这个决议，为美帝国主义干涉刚果开了方便之门，是在联合国的名义下侵犯新独立国家的主权的恶劣的先例。十五年来无数历史事实反复证明，美帝国主义利用联合国作为它的侵略工具。恶名昭著的可耻的记录是：美国曾经利用联合国的幌子，犯下了侵略朝鲜的滔天罪行，直到今天，美国侵略军队还赖在南朝鲜。美国曾经利用“联合国”干涉匈牙利内政，污蔑苏联；去年12月9日，美国又一次开动联合国大会的表决机器，通过了所谓“匈牙利问题”的提案。最近期间，美国接连派间谍飞机，侵入苏联领空，严重地威胁了世界和平，遭到全世界的谴责；但是，在联合国安全理事会上，美国却多数票否决了苏联对美国侵略罪行的控诉，庇护它的侵略罪行。不久以前，美国又操纵以安理会的多数票，拒绝了古巴对美国侵略的控诉案。美国十一年来操纵联合国顽固地非法剥夺了中国的席位，并且一再通过诬蔑中国侵略的非法提案。面对这些冷酷的事实，人们怎么能够相信迄今仍然在美国操纵下的联合国会主持正义，怎么能够相信它真的会帮助反对殖民主义的斗争呢？对于安全理事会干涉刚果的决议，人们怎么能够不把它看成是美国强盗又一次罪行的护身符呢？
    美帝国主义的辩护士企图为自己解脱，说什么联合国的干涉是应刚果政府的请求的。但是，说到刚果政府的立场，根本不能洗刷美国的罪行。刚果政府当时的请求是为的保证国家的独立和主权，是为的制止比利时殖民者的侵略。刚果政府请求的是联合国给予军事技术援助。而现在在联合国的名义下，发生了一系列侵犯刚果主权的事件。不但旧的殖民者——比利时殖民者没有撤退，而且新的殖民者——美国殖民者又涌进来了。美国人本奇俨然以太上皇自居。难道这一切不是应当由美帝国主义承担罪责吗？
    刚果在宣布独立后还不到十天就遭到比利时殖民者的侵略。这对于这个初生的共和国来说是极其严重的威胁和困难。刚果政府希望联合国出来主持公道，这是可以理解的。刚果政府本来没有想到，新殖民主义者竟然这样卑鄙地利用它的善良的愿望，竟然打着联合国的招牌进行新的征服。现在，吃一亏，长一智。新殖民者在刚果的胡作非为，激起了刚果人民的无限义愤。
    刚果人民正在从苦难中更坚强地站起来。利奥波德维尔的刚果军警，重新拿起武器，搜捕隐藏在联合国部队中的比利时伞兵和间谍，对于那些抗拒检查的白人军队的挑衅，进行了反击。这是任何有自尊心的民族，所应当采取的爱国正义行动。在开赛省路路阿堡，在加丹加省的刚果罗、马诺诺、穆隆果等城镇，刚果人民反对“联合国军”侵犯主权和比利时殖民者为非作歹的斗争，正日益高涨。刚果政府总理卢蒙巴接连发表谈话和声明，强烈谴责联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德是“加丹加分裂的同谋者”，谴责联合国中的白人军队侮辱刚果士兵，“要求立即撤走白人军队”，揭露“联合国想取代（刚果）合法政府并在刚果施行权力”。卢蒙巴说，“我们不愿用联合国占领代替比利时占领。”这是对新殖民主义者的有力的回答。
    目前，刚果人民的斗争，不仅关乎刚果的命运，而且也是和非洲各国人民的命运休戚相关的。正如几内亚总统杜尔在最近的谈话中所指出的，“刚果的斗争已不仅仅是刚果民族主义运动反对帝国主义者和殖民主义者的斗争。这是非洲希望取得完全独立和广泛享受自己的自由，反对那些仍然想压迫和剥削它的人的斗争。”他呼吁全世界一切民主力量，包括非洲所有的独立国家，应当联合自己的力量，粉碎帝国主义者反对年青的刚果国家的恶毒计划。
    目前，刚果人民面临着同以美国为首的新老殖民主义者的严重斗争。有着为民族独立斗争的光荣传统的刚果人民，过去没有被比利时殖民主义者所屈服，现在也绝不是美帝国主义所能欺骗和镇压得了的。整个世界形势，是对刚果人民的斗争有利的，他们有着整个非洲人民的支持，有着全世界人民的支持。中国人民相信，尽管在前进的道路上还有种种困难，刚果人民终将排除像冲伯那样一小撮服务于帝国主义分裂刚果阴谋的民族败类，加强团结，共同斗争，克服一切困难，赢得维护独立、维护新生的刚果共和国领土主权完整的最后胜利。中国人民坚决地站在刚果人民一边，谴责比利时殖民者和在联合国招牌掩盖下的美帝国主义侵略刚果的罪行，完全支持刚果人民的英勇斗争。
