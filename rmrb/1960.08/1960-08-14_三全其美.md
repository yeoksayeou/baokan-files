　　After the rain, the weeds in the fields grew rapidly. Qu Minglian, a young salesperson at the Balizhuang outlet of the Dongguang Central Store, busily pushed eight weeders on a rubber-wheeled cart straight to the Shiliuzhuang Production Team. He ran into Wu Mengfu, the Party Branch Secretary of the production team, in the courtyard of the production team office. Secretary Wu immediately asked, "Little Qu, is this a gift for our team?" Little Qu smiled and said, "That's right." Secretary Wu thought: The team is indeed short of these tools, but the higher authorities are currently calling for thrift. Buying all these farm implements would cost a lot of money! Little Qu had already guessed what Secretary Wu was thinking.

　　At noon, the commune members returned from the fields and gathered in the canteen for lunch. Salesperson Little Qu picked up the megaphone and announced: "Commune members, pay attention! I'm buying scrap copper, scrap iron, eggs... I'm buying everything here." Secretary Wu stood next to Little Qu's purchasing stall and also urged everyone to sell their waste and old items to the store. Before long, the first team sent over rapeseed, and the second team's storekeeper brought over scrap iron; one commune member sent over leather scraps, and another old lady sent over eggs. In a short while, Little Qu paid out over 300 yuan in cash for the purchases. He smiled and said to Secretary Wu, "Isn't the money to buy the weeders solved now?"

　　Normally, Little Qu often worked alongside the commune members. When the commune members rested, he would either collect scrap or sell goods. This time, he enabled the production team to buy weeders and pesticides, and also used the money from the purchases to buy sweet potato seedlings. Secretary Wu patted Little Qu on the shoulder and said, "We completed the task of eliminating wasteland, increased our income, and you also completed your supply task. The Party committee, the commune members, and the store are all satisfied. This is truly achieving perfection on all three sides."

    三全其美
    雨后天晴，地里的草多起来了。东光中心商店八里庄门市部的青年售货员曲明连，忙着用胶轮车推上八架耘锄直奔十二里庄生产队。他在生产队办公室的院里正遇上生产队党支部书记吴孟福。吴书记开口就问：“小曲，这是给我们队送来的礼物吧？”小曲笑着说：“对”。吴书记想：队里正缺这家伙，不过目前上级正号召节约，这些农具都买下来，可要花些钱啊！谁知道小曲早就猜到吴书记的心思了。
    中午，社员们下地回来了，都凑到食堂里来吃饭，只见售货员小曲拿起广播筒在喊：“社员们注意，碎铜、烂铁、鸡蛋……，我这里都收。”吴支书站在小曲的收购摊子旁，也招呼大家把废旧什物卖给商店。不一会，一小队送来了菜籽，二小队保管员找来了烂铁；这个社员送来了皮条，那位大娘送来了鸡蛋。一会儿的工夫，小曲付出了收购现款三百多元。他笑着对吴支书说：“买耘锄的钱不是解决了吗？”
    平时，小曲经常和社员们一道干活，社员休息的时候，他不是收废品，就是卖货。这次，他让生产队买了耘锄、农药，还拿收购的钱买了山芋秧。吴支书拍着小曲的肩膀说：“我们完成了灭荒任务，又增加了收入，你也完成了供应任务。党委、社员、商店都满意。这真是三全其美。”
