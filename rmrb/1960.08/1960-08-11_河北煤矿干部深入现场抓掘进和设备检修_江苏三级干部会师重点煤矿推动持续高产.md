Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th. Hebei Province is making every effort to promote substantial increases in production in nearly two hundred large, medium, and small coal mines to support the sustained leap forward of the steel industry. In addition to the relevant departments of the province taking solid measures to vigorously grasp current production to ensure that large and small coal mines and new and old mines can give full play to their production capacity, and strengthening production preparation and maintenance of electromechanical equipment to create good conditions for the sustained leap forward in coal mine production, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has also extracted more than 16,000 workers from projects such as compressing capital construction to replenish the coal mine workforce in order to strengthen coal mine production forces.

At the same time, from the coal mining bureau to the mine, a large number of leading cadres went deep into the front line of production and formed various groups for coal mining, tunneling, equipment maintenance, and project connection to help solve key problems more specifically at the production site. Leading cadres of the Kailuan Coal Mine led a group of production pacesetters in the mining area to form an advanced experience dissemination group to promote eleven systems of advanced experience in mining, tunneling, hoisting, transportation, and safety at the production site. Through on-site demonstrations and lectures, they solved some key production problems. Leading cadres of the Jingxing Coal Mine moved their luggage to the mine, ate, lived, and worked with the workers, improved on-site command, and promoted production.

The staff and workers of more than 150 small coal mines in the province broke the usual practice of "small kilns not operating in summer, digging coal in winter and spring, and resting in the rainy season," digging large drainage ditches, and filling in water pits and abandoned wells near the pit mouth to ensure safe and normal production during the rainy season.

The Party committees of coal mines throughout the province have included strengthening production preparation on the important agenda, and have determined that a deputy secretary and deputy mine manager should be responsible for this work. In order to speed up the tunneling progress and ensure the connection between mining and tunneling, the coal mines also launched a competition among the workers in the tunneling working faces to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the rapid tunneling teams of Ren Guangjin and Li Changliang.

In order to ensure a double harvest in both extraction and tunneling, coal mines in various places have established and improved the daily maintenance and overhaul system for electromechanical equipment, and have insisted on implementing the rotation and cross-overhaul system for large-scale coal mine production equipment, thereby ensuring the safe and normal operation of electromechanical equipment.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th. More than one hundred leading cadres at all levels in Jiangsu Province went deep into the front line of production at the province's key coal mine—Xuzhou Coal Mine, and met with the mine's leading cadres underground to promote a sustained leap forward in coal production. These leading cadres were drawn from provincial-level organs and the Xuzhou Prefectural Committee and Xuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. After arriving at the coal mine, they respectively served as deputy mine managers, deputy secretaries of the work area branch, deputy district chiefs, and other substantive positions, participating in labor while participating in production leadership, and striving for high yields with the miners, forming a situation of unity from top to bottom to strive for a leap forward.

After the arrival of cadres at all levels in the coal mine, focusing on the key issues in current political work and production, they investigated and studied, dissected "sparrows", used the advanced to lead the backward, and promoted the backward to catch up with the advanced. Liang Ruren, First Secretary of the Xuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, led a work team to the tunneling fifth district of the Xiaqiao Coal Mine, researched and summarized the experience of the Party branch in strengthening grassroots political and ideological work and helping backward people quickly catch up with the advanced, and promptly carried out promotion work. After Mu Zijing, Secretary of the Xuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, went deep into the Quantai Coal Mine, he helped the second work area with the largest coal mining volume solve key problems such as water leakage from water guns and water pipes, which doubled the daily production level of this work area. He also studied the mining situation of the entire mine with the mine's Party committee, and formulated practical and effective measures to ensure that both mining and tunneling were grasped, ensuring the continuous rise in raw coal production.

While grasping ideology and production, the leading cadres also attached great importance to grasping the life of the miners. They held miners' symposiums to listen to opinions, and went deep into the canteens to help better improve food work.

After the leading cadres of the provincial, prefectural, and municipal committees went deep into the mines, they promoted the further transformation of the style of grassroots cadres in various mines. Now, the cadres of each mine choose a work area to engage in "experimental fields". Through office work at the mine entrance, underground duty, and participation in labor, they create and summarize production experience to promote production step by step. The tunneling work of the Xinzhuang Coal Mine could not keep up with the needs of the recovery, so Wang Xiaoxin, Deputy Secretary of the Mine Party Committee, led a work team to "settle down" in the tunneling second district, worked shifts, vigorously grasped the promotion of advanced technology, and increased the daily rock tunneling from one meter to three point three meters, and the heading of coal roadways from ten meters to thirty-eight point four meters.

    河北煤矿干部深入现场抓掘进和设备检修
    江苏三级干部会师重点煤矿推动持续高产
    新华社天津10日电　河北省多方设法促进近两百座大中小型煤矿大幅度增产，支援钢铁工业持续跃进。除开省的有关部门采取扎实措施狠抓当前生产，保证大小煤矿和新老矿井都能充分发挥生产能力，并且加强生产准备和机电设备维护检修工作，为煤矿生产持续跃进创造良好条件之外，中共河北省委为了加强煤矿生产力量，还从压缩基本建设工程等方面抽出一万六千多名工人，充实了煤矿工人队伍。
    与此同时，从煤矿矿务局到矿井，大批领导干部深入生产第一线，组成了采煤、掘进、设备检修、工程衔接等各种小组，在生产现场更具体地帮助解决关键问题。开滦煤矿领导干部带领矿区一批生产标兵组成了先进经验传播团，到生产现场推广采掘、提升、运输、安全等十一套系统的先进经验；他们通过井下现场表演、井上讲解传授等办法，使一些生产关键问题迎刃而解。井陉煤矿领导干部把行李搬到矿上，跟工人同吃同住同劳动，健全了现场指挥，促进了生产。
    全省一百五十多个小型煤矿的职工，打破历来认为“小窑不过夏，冬春挖煤雨季歇”的常规，大挖泄水沟，填平坑口附近积水坑和废井，保证了雨季安全正常生产。
    全省各地煤矿党委都把加强生产准备列入了重要议事日程，并且确定由一名副书记和副矿长专管这一工作。为了加快掘进进度，保证采掘衔接，各煤矿还发动掘进工作面的工人开展了学、赶、超任广金、李长亮快速掘进队的竞赛运动。
    为了保证回采和掘进双丰收，各地煤矿都建立和健全了机电设备的日常维护和检修制度，并且坚持贯彻了煤矿大型生产设备的轮流交叉检修制度，从而保证了机电设备安全正常运转。
    新华社南京10日电　江苏省一百多名各级领导干部深入省的重点煤矿——徐州煤矿生产第一线，同矿上的领导干部一起会师井下，促进煤炭生产持续跃进。这批领导干部是从省级机关和中共徐州地委、徐州市委抽调的。他们到煤矿以后分别担任了副矿长、工区支部副书记、副区长等实职，一边参加劳动，一边参加生产领导，同矿工一起奋夺高产，形成了上下一条心同心协力争跃进的局面。
    各级干部到达煤矿以后，围绕当前政治工作和生产中的关键问题，调查研究，解剖“麻雀”，以先进带后进，促后进赶先进。中共徐州市委第一书记梁如仁率领工作组到夏桥煤矿掘进五区，研究总结了党支部加强基层政治思想工作、帮助后进者迅速赶上先进的经验，并且及时地进行了推广工作。中共徐州市委书记牟子敬深入权台煤矿以后，帮助采煤量最大的二工区解决了水枪水管漏水等关键问题，使这个工区的日产水平成倍提高。他还同矿党委一起研究了全矿采掘情况，并且制订出切实有效的措施，做到了回采掘进两手抓，保证了原煤生产持续上升。
    领导干部在抓思想抓生产的同时，还十分重视抓矿工的生活。他们召开矿工座谈会听取意见，并且深入食堂，帮助更好地改进伙食工作。
    省和地委、市委的领导干部深入矿井后，促进各矿基层干部进一步转变了作风。现在，各矿干部都选择一个工区搞“试验田”。他们通过井口办公、井下值班、参加劳动等，创造和总结生产经验，推动生产步步登高。新庄煤矿掘进工作跟不上回采需要，矿党委副书记王孝信就带领一个工作组到掘进二区“落户”，跟班劳动，大抓推广先进技术，使岩石日掘进由一米提高到三点三米，煤巷独头掘进由十米增加到三十八点四米。
