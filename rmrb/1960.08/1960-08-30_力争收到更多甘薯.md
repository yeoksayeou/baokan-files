Strive to Harvest More Sweet Potatoes
Commentator of this newspaper

The most important task on the agricultural front currently is to go all out, strengthen field management in autumn, and strive for a bumper harvest in autumn, especially a bumper grain harvest. Among autumn-harvested grain crops, sweet potatoes occupy a very important position. The planting area and yield of sweet potatoes account for more than 80% of tuber crops, while the planting area of tuber crops accounts for about 12% of the area of grain crops, and the yield accounts for more than 20% of the total grain output. This proportion shows that sweet potato is a high-yielding crop. Strengthening sweet potato field management and striving for greater sweet potato yield increases is of great significance for rapidly increasing this year's grain production.

This year's sweet potato planting area has increased a lot compared to last year. At present, spring sweet potatoes have entered the later stage of growth, with stems, leaves, and tubers expanding rapidly; summer sweet potatoes are branching and closing ridges, and some have already formed tubers. Most sweet potatoes are growing well. However, in some areas, due to insufficient seedlings and the impact of drought, the planting period was delayed, and the quality of the seedlings was poor. In particular, some late sweet potatoes that were rushed to be planted after rain lacked sufficient base fertilizer, had rough soil preparation, and had more missing seedlings. In addition, there has been a lot of cloudy and rainy weather recently, and some sweet potato fields have experienced weed infestation and soil compaction. This has greatly increased the task of field management. In order to win a bumper harvest of sweet potatoes this year, we must seize the current favorable opportunity and take some effective measures in a down-to-earth manner to strengthen sweet potato field management.

Sweet potato is an asexual vegetative body that can continue to grow under certain temperature conditions. From planting to harvesting, according to its growth and development characteristics, it can be divided into two stages: the early stage of growth and the later stage of growth. In the early stage, it recovers, survives, branches, and forms tubers, trailing vines and closing ridges; in the later stage, after the sweet potato stems and leaves close the ridges, the plants grow vigorously, and the tubers gradually increase in size. At present, it is the peak growing season for sweet potatoes. As long as we carefully study and grasp the law of sweet potato growth and actively and timely take various necessary management measures, it is entirely possible to strive for greater sweet potato yield increases this year.

What effective measures should be taken to strengthen sweet potato field management? For summer sweet potatoes in the early stage of growth, it is necessary to apply one or two applications of fast-acting nitrogen fertilizer as early as possible according to the crop growth to promote rapid growth of the seedlings; appropriate application of phosphate and potash fertilizers can also be applied to facilitate early tuber formation and more tuber formation; it is necessary to seize the time for intertillage and soil cultivation to eliminate weed infestation and soil compaction. For spring sweet potatoes or early-planted summer sweet potatoes that have entered the later stage of growth, weeds should be removed; in the case of heavy rain, long-vine varieties can be properly lifted to prevent the growth of roots from consuming fertility and nutrients. In the past, in areas with the habit of turning vines, it is advisable to change turning vines to lifting vines to avoid damaging stems and leaves and affecting normal growth. In order to promote tuber growth, attention should be paid to drainage and rational irrigation to avoid excessive moisture in the ridge soil, which affects tuber development. Some sweet potato fields have been infested with pests such as beet armyworms, loopers, and leaf rollers, and effective measures should be taken to eliminate them as early as possible. Regions with the conditions can carry out foliar fertilization. According to test results, spraying with 1% superphosphate solution or wood ash water has a certain yield-increasing effect. In field management, it is necessary to not only do a good job in high-yield fields, but also to grasp general fields and eliminate low-yield fields, strive for comprehensive and balanced yield increases, so as to ensure the increase in total sweet potato production.

The key to doing a good job in sweet potato field management lies in truly strengthening political and ideological leadership. At present, some people still believe that "sweet potato is a lazy crop, it will grow even if you don't care for it," and some people also believe that "farm work is so busy, how can we take care of sweet potatoes?" These ideas are wrong and must be quickly corrected. The next two or three months are the key period for increasing sweet potato production. Leaders at all levels should quickly take effective measures, rationally arrange labor, and strengthen sweet potato field management. Leading cadres should go deep into the key sweet potato producing areas to understand the situation, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner, so as to strive for a bumper harvest of sweet potatoes this year.

    力争收到更多甘薯
    本报评论员
    当前农业战线最重要的任务是：鼓足干劲，加强秋田管理，力争秋季丰收，特别是粮食丰收。在秋收粮食作物中，甘薯占有相当重要的地位。甘薯的种植面积和产量占薯类作物的80％以上，而薯类的种植面积占粮食作物面积12％左右，产量占粮食总产量的20％以上。这个比例说明甘薯是一种高产作物，加强甘薯田间管理，争取甘薯更多增产，对于迅速增加今年粮食生产具有重大的意义。
    今年甘薯种植面积比去年增加很多。目前春甘薯已经进入生长后期，茎叶薯块在迅速膨大；夏甘薯正在分枝、封垅，有的已经结薯。多数甘薯是长得很好的。但是，有一部分地区，由于薯苗不足和干旱的影响，栽期推迟了些，苗子质量较差；特别是雨后抢栽的一些晚甘薯，底肥不足，整地粗糙，缺苗较多，加上最近阴雨多，有一部分甘薯田出现了草荒和土壤板结的现象。这就极大地增加了田间管理的任务。为了夺取今年甘薯丰收，我们必须抓紧当前的有利时机，扎扎实实地采取一些有效的措施，加强甘薯田间管理。
    甘薯是一种无性营养体，在一定气温条件下可以不断生长。从栽插到收获，按照它的生长发育特点，可分为生长前期和生长后期两个阶段。在前期，它还苗，成活，分枝结薯，拖秧封垅；在后期，甘薯茎叶封垅后，植株生长旺盛，薯块日渐增大。目前正是甘薯生长盛期，只要认真研究和掌握甘薯生长的规律，积极地适时地采取各种必要的管理措施，争取今年甘薯更多增产是完全可能的。
    加强甘薯田间管理应采取哪些有效措施呢？对于生长前期的夏甘薯，要按照作物生长情况，及早普追一、二次速效氮肥，促进薯苗迅速生长；还可以适当追施磷钾肥，以利早结薯、多结薯；要抓紧中耕培土，消灭草荒和土壤板结的现象。对于进入生长后期的春甘薯或早插的夏甘薯，要清除杂草；在多雨的情况下，对于长蔓品种可以适当提蔓，防止生长根须消耗地力和养分。过去有翻蔓习惯的地方，宜改翻蔓为提蔓，以免损伤茎叶，影响正常生长。为了促进薯块生长，要注意排水与合理灌溉，避免垅土过湿，影响薯块发育。有些薯田发生了斜纹夜蛾、造桥虫、卷叶虫等害虫，应当采取有效措施，及早消灭。有条件的地区可以实行根外追肥，据试验结果，用1％过磷酸钙液或草木灰水喷施，有一定增产效果。在田间管理中，既要搞好丰产田，也要抓紧一般田，消灭低产田，争取全面平衡增产，以保证甘薯总产量的增加。
    搞好甘薯田间管理的关键，在于切实加强政治思想领导。目前还有人认为“甘薯是懒庄稼，不管也会长”，也有人认为“农活这么忙，哪能顾到甘薯”？这些思想都是不对的，必须迅速纠正。今后两三个月是甘薯增产的关键时期，各级领导部门应当迅速采取有效措施，合理安排劳力，加强甘薯田间管理。领导干部应深入甘薯的重点产区，了解情况，发现问题，及时解决，争取今年甘薯丰收。
