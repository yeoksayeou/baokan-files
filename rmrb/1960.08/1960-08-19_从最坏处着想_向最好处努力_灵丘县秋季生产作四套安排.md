Taiyuan, August 18th (reported by this newspaper) Lingqiu County, Shanxi Province, is promoting the experience of the county's Luoshui River in combating disasters and drought. By adopting the method of "prevention first, four sets of arrangements," they have launched a "four supplements" high-yield and increased-income campaign centered on vigorously attacking the late-stage management of autumn fields.

Since last winter, Lingqiu has suffered an unprecedented severe drought with no heavy snow or thorough rain for nine and a half consecutive months. Therefore, throughout the spring and summer seasons, the Lingqiu County Party Committee and leaders at all levels, on the one hand, organized the masses to dig canals, build reservoirs, and sink wells, making every effort to expand the irrigated area and fight the drought; on the other hand, in the spirit of seeking truth from facts, thinking of the worst, and striving for the best, they adopted the working method of "prevention first, four sets of arrangements," persisted in the fight against drought, strengthened the late-stage management of autumn fields, and launched a high-yield and increased-income campaign.

The first set of arrangements is to carry out "four supplements." That is: to compensate for the reduced production of summer fields with autumn fields, to compensate for the reduced production of slopes and ridges with guaranteed-yield fields, to compensate for the reduced grain production with vegetables, and to compensate for the reduced agricultural production with sideline occupations. Since the county's 80,000 mu of summer crops such as wheat and broad beans were slightly less productive than last year, various localities actively strengthened the field management of 440,000 mu of major autumn crops such as yam (i.e., potatoes) and corn. After the rainfall in early July, while not relaxing drought prevention and resistance, they further concentrated the strong labor force on autumn field management, and launched a concentrated attack on weeding and topdressing, reversing the backward situation of field management in the previous stage. At present, the county's major autumn crops have basically been weeded twice, of which more than 40,000 mu of yam and corn have been weeded three times; 74,000 mu of high-yield crops have been topdressed with 45 dan of high-quality fertilizer per mu, and all autumn crops are currently growing vigorously.

The second set of arrangements is: if another drought occurs, on the basis of comprehensively managing the autumn fields, we will vigorously grasp the guaranteed-yield fields. Lingqiu has many hillside lands and few flatlands, and is greatly threatened by drought. Therefore, special "care" is given to 280,000 mu of waterlogged land, low-lying land, and shady land and other guaranteed-yield fields. It is required that 80,000 mu of corn be universally artificially pollinated, and yams be sprayed with medicine to strictly prevent the occurrence of late blight. Full estimates and specific arrangements for prevention and control measures have also been made for various natural disasters that may occur before the autumn harvest, and the guaranteed-yield fields must be firmly managed.

The third set of arrangements is to vigorously grasp vegetable production. Starting in early July, while seizing the rain to rush-plant late autumn crops, the county vigorously rush-planted autumn vegetables. In less than half a month, 40,200 mu of autumn vegetables such as radishes, cabbage, and mustard were rush-planted by means of replanting summer fields, opening up wasteland, and using ridge and field edges. After the central government issued the spirit of vigorously grasping autumn vegetable planting, it further boosted the enthusiasm of the masses, and in late July, they planted 13,000 mu of autumn vegetables in scattered small plots of land and around houses. It is estimated that the total vegetable production in the county (excluding spring and summer vegetables), plus the collected wild vegetables, will average 1,000 jin per person.

The fourth set of arrangements is to vigorously develop diversified operations and launch the "ten thousand treasures down the mountain" campaign. The general requirement is "increased production must increase income, and reduced production must increase income even more." Although it is currently the off-season for collecting and processing mountain products and purchasing agricultural and sideline products, the county's sideline income has still reached 2.6 million yuan, an increase of 15% over the same period last year. The Lingqiu County Party Committee plans to organize a team from mid-August to the beginning of the autumn harvest to launch the first battle of "ten thousand treasures down the mountain" and work hard for a month.

### 从最坏处着想　向最好处努力  灵丘县秋季生产作四套安排

    从最坏处着想　向最好处努力
    灵丘县秋季生产作四套安排
    本报太原18日电　山西省灵丘县推广本县落水河防灾抗旱斗争经验，采用防字当先，四套安排的办法，开展了以猛攻秋田后期管理为中心的“四补”高产增收运动。
    去冬迄今，灵丘遭受了连续九个半月没有大雪透雨的空前大旱。因此，在整个春夏两季，中共灵丘县委和各级领导，一面组织群众开渠、筑库、打井，千方百计扩大灌溉面积，和干旱进行斗争；一面本着实事求是的精神从最坏处着想，向最好处努力，采取了“防字当先，四套安排”的工作方法，坚持抗旱斗争，加强秋田后期管理，开展高产增收运动。
    第一套安排是进行“四补”。就是：夏田减产秋田补，坡梁地减产保收田补，粮食减产蔬菜补，农业减产副业补。由于全县八万亩小麦、蚕豆等夏田作物比去年稍有减产，各地就积极加强了四十四万亩山药（即马铃薯）、玉米等大秋作物的田间管理。7月初降雨后，在不放松防旱抗旱的前提下，进一步把精壮劳力集中到秋田管理方面来，突击锄苗、追肥，扭转了前段田间管理的落后局面。到目前，全县大秋作物基本普锄两次，其中四万多亩山药、玉米锄过三次；七万四千亩高产作物每亩施追优质肥四十五担，目前全部秋作物生长茂盛。
    第二套安排是：如果再遭受旱灾，就在全面管理好秋田的基础上，狠狠抓好保收田。灵丘山坡地多、平川地少，一遇干旱，所受威胁很大。因此对二十八万亩水地、下湿地、背荫地等保收田特别予以“照顾”。要求八万亩玉米普遍进行人工授粉，山药普打药剂，严防晚疫病发生。对于各种可能在秋收以前发生的自然灾害，也作了充分的估计和具体安排了防治措施，坚决管好保收田。
    第三套安排是大抓蔬菜生产。从7月初开始，全县在乘雨抢种晚秋作物的同时，大力抢种了秋菜。不到半月，就采用夏田复播、开荒、利用塄头地畔突击播种萝卜、白菜、芥菜等秋菜四万零二百亩。中央关于大抓秋菜播种的精神下达后，更鼓起了群众的劲头，7月下旬又在零星闲散的小块土地和屋前屋后播种了秋菜一万三千亩。预计全县蔬菜总产（不包括春夏菜）加上采集的野菜，每人可平均达到一千斤。
    第四套安排是大搞多种经营，开展万宝下山运动。总的要求是“增产要增收、减产更要增收”。现在虽然是采集和加工山货、收购农副土特产品的淡季，但这个县的副业收入仍然达到了二百六十万元，比去年同期提高了15％。中共灵丘县委计划从8月中旬到秋收开始的一段时间内，全县组织一支队伍，开展第一个“万宝下山”的战役，大干一月。
