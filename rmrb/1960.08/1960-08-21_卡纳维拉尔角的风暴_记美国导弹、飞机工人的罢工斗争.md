    The storm of a strike struggle to defend vital rights and strive for improved living conditions spread wave upon wave from Cape Canaveral, the "Atlas" intercontinental missile testing center in Florida, to several major air force bases and cities. Convair Aircraft Company, which manufactures the "Atlas" intercontinental missile, Lockheed Corporation, which manufactures the U-2 aircraft, "Polaris" missile, and "Samos" spy satellite, Douglas Aircraft Company, which manufactures the "Nike" missile, "Thor" missile, and space vehicles, and United Aircraft Corporation, which engages in aircraft production and missile and atomic engine research, were all affected. The United States' plan to expand its arms and prepare for war was directly hit. Curtis LeMay, Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, told reporters in Los Angeles that the continuing strikes affecting the implementation of military plans "may pose a threat to the free world."

    The U.S. ruling clique is pursuing a policy of frantic arms expansion and war preparation, constantly increasing military expenditures, and the burden on the working people is becoming heavier and heavier. American workers have launched a heroic struggle to improve their living conditions. According to statistics published by the U.S. government, there were 720 strikes in the first quarter of this year, involving 220,000 workers, while in April alone, there were 530 strike incidents, involving 190,000 workers. After June, the strike struggle of American workers continued to expand, and the striking workers were mainly workers in the defense industry such as missiles and aircraft.

    Cape Canaveral is the "Missile City" of the United States. Convair, Boeing, Lockheed and other companies have factories and missile testing centers here. On June 6, 1,500 mechanical workers employed by Convair at Cape Canaveral went on strike to improve their living conditions. Striking workers set up picket lines at the south and north gates of the testing center. The struggle of the mechanical workers was supported by other workers. Two thousand construction workers and 1,500 transportation workers refused to cross the picket lines to go to work at the testing center. Many workers at the factories of Boeing, Lockheed, Douglas and other aircraft companies at Cape Canaveral also stopped work. Mechanical workers employed by Convair at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska, also went on strike at the same time. Their strike was also supported by other workers, bringing construction projects at the three bases to a standstill.

    Convair is the largest division of General Dynamics Corporation. Its products account for three-quarters of General Dynamics' products. Convair originally had factories in San Diego, California, that manufactured missiles, military aircraft, and electronic equipment. In 1958, it opened a factory to manufacture the "Atlas" intercontinental missile. On June 13 this year, the "Engineers and Architects Association" in San Diego issued a notice to its 6,000 members, asking them to strike every Monday within the Convair company to demand wage increases. The "Engineers and Architects Association" also dispatched an aircraft flying a strike banner to fly over Convair's two factories in San Diego to set up an aerial picket line to prevent some engineers bought by capitalists from going to work by helicopter.

    In Connecticut, workers at seven aircraft factories of "United Aircraft Corporation" went on a major strike on June 9, demanding higher wages and no further layoffs. According to preliminary statistics, 33,000 workers participated in the strike. The authorities used various methods to sabotage the strike, resulting in clashes between worker pickets and the police, and many workers were arrested. In order to put pressure on the striking workers, "United Aircraft Corporation" asked the local court to issue an order prohibiting the activities of the worker pickets.

    Lockheed Corporation and Douglas Corporation are two large companies manufacturing missiles and military aircraft controlled by the Los Angeles financial group. Lockheed manufactures the U-2 aircraft, "Polaris" missiles, "Vanguard" satellites, as well as spy satellites "Samos" and "Midas". Douglas manufactures the "Thor" intermediate-range missile and researches the "Nike-Zeus" system according to the tasks proposed by the Army. On June 14, 11,500 workers at Lockheed's three factories in California went on strike. On the same day, 22,500 workers at Douglas' factories in Long Beach, California, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina, participated in the strike.

    The strike incidents of American missile and aircraft workers, except for the struggle of the "United Aircraft Corporation" workers which is still ongoing, the other few have been temporarily resolved with the capitalists reluctantly making some concessions. However, the storm at Cape Canaveral has not ended. On August 1, "U.S. News & World Report" wrote in an article: "Military personnel believe that labor disputes will increase in the future, not decrease." Moreover, throughout the United States, the struggle of workers to defend their vital rights and strive for improved living conditions is unfolding vigorously. On July 1, 8,500 members of the Metal Workers Union affiliated with the AFL-CIO and 1,400 members of the Heavy Truck Drivers Union at New York's Idlewild International Airport went on strike separately, demanding wage increases. Ten thousand cleaners in New York also went on strike on July 27 and 28 and held a massive mass demonstration in front of New York City Hall, demanding improved treatment. On August 2, Pan American Airlines also experienced a strike by employees demanding improved living and working conditions.

    The U.S. government is uneasy about the missile workers' strike. According to an article in the August 1 issue of "U.S. News & World Report": "The Pentagon is about to intervene and take a 'tough' approach to end the delays in work at this missile base." "The Department of Defense has ordered the Air Force to 'use tough measures to stop the quarrel' when necessary..." However, in the context of the increasingly acute domestic class contradictions in imperialist countries, no matter what "tough measures" the U.S. ruling clique takes, the struggle of American workers to defend their vital interests and improve their living conditions cannot be stopped.

    卡纳维拉尔角的风暴
    ——记美国导弹、飞机工人的罢工斗争
    一个维护切身权利、争取改善生活条件的罢工斗争风暴，此起彼伏地从佛罗里达州“阿特拉斯”洲际导弹试验中心卡纳维拉尔角，向一些主要的空军基地和城市展开。制造“阿特拉斯”洲际导弹的康瓦尔飞机公司，制造U—2飞机、“北极星”导弹、“萨摩斯”间谍卫星的洛克希德公司，制造“奈克”导弹、“雷神”导弹以及空间载运工具的道格拉斯飞机公司，从事飞机生产和导弹、原子发动机研究的联合飞机公司都受到了影响。美国扩军备战的计划受到了直接的打击。美国空军参谋部副参谋长柯蒂斯·李梅在洛杉矶对记者发表谈话时叫嚷，影响实现军事计划的继续不断的罢工“可能发生对自由世界的威胁”。
    美国统治集团奉行着疯狂扩军备战的政策，不断地扩大军费开支，劳动人民的负担愈来愈为沉重。美国工人为了争取改善生活条件，展开了英勇的斗争。据美国官方所发表的统计数字，今年第一季度罢工达七百二十起，参加罢工的工人二十二万名，而今年4月份一个月，罢工事件共有五百三十起，参加罢工的工人达十九万名。6月以后，美国工人罢工斗争不断地扩大，罢工工人主要的是导弹、飞机等国防工业的工人。
    卡纳维拉尔角是美国的“导弹城”。这里有康瓦尔、波音、洛克希德等公司设立的工厂和导弹实验中心。6月6日康瓦尔公司在卡纳维拉尔角雇用的一千五百名机械工人，为争取改善生活条件举行了罢工。罢工工人在试验中心的南门和北门布置了纠察线。机械工人的斗争得到了其他工人的支持。两千名建筑工人和一千五百名运输工人拒绝通过纠察线进入试验中心去上班。波音、洛克希德和道格拉斯等飞机公司在卡纳维拉尔角的工厂，也有许多工人停止了工作。康瓦尔公司在加利福尼亚州范登堡空军基地、怀俄明州夏延的华伦空军基地和内布拉斯加州奥马哈附近的奥佛特空军基地雇用的机械工人也同时举行了罢工。他们的罢工也受到其他工人的支持，使三个基地的建筑工程陷入停顿。
    康瓦尔公司是通用动力公司最大的分部。它的产品占通用动力公司产品的四分之三。康瓦尔公司在加利福尼亚州圣地亚哥市原设有制造导弹、军用飞机、电子设备的工厂，1958年又开设了制造“阿特拉斯”洲际导弹的工厂。今年6月13日，圣地亚哥市的“工程师和建筑师联合会”向它的六千名会员发出通知，要他们每星期一在康瓦尔公司范围内举行罢工要求增加工资。“工程师和建筑师联合会”还出动一架飘着罢工旗帜的飞机，在圣地亚哥康瓦尔的两家工厂的上空飞行，布置空中纠察线，防止某些被资本家收买的工程师乘坐直升飞机前去上班。
    在康涅狄格州，“联合飞机公司”七个飞机工厂的工人于6月9日举行了大罢工，要求提高工资和不再解雇工人。据初步的统计，参加这次罢工的工人达三万三千名。当局采用了种种方法来破坏罢工，结果工人纠察队同警察发生了冲突，许多工人被捕。“联合飞机公司”方面为了对罢工工人施加压力，要求地方法院下令禁止工人纠察队的活动。
    洛克希德公司和道格拉斯公司是洛杉矶金融集团操纵的制造导弹和军用飞机的两家大公司。洛克希德公司制造U—2飞机、“北极星”导弹、“先锋”卫星以及间谍卫星“萨摩斯”和“迈达斯”。道格拉斯公司制造“雷神”中程导弹，根据陆军提出的任务研究“奈克—宙斯”系统。6月14日，洛克希德在加利福尼亚州的三个工厂，有一万一千五百名工人举行了罢工。同日，道格拉斯公司在加利福尼亚的长滩、俄克拉何马州的土耳沙和北卡罗来纳州的沙罗等地的工厂中，有两万两千五百名工人参加了罢工。
    美国导弹、飞机工人罢工的事件，除“联合飞机公司”工人的斗争尚在进行中，其他的几项在资方勉强作出一些让步的情况下，暂时解决。可是卡纳维拉尔角的风暴却并没有结束。8月1日“美国新闻和世界报道”在一篇文章里就写道：“军事人员们认为将来的劳工纠纷将会增加，而不会减少。”而且，在整个美国，工人维护切身权利、争取改善生活条件的斗争也风起云涌地开展着。7月1日，参加劳联—产联的五金工会的八千五百名会员，纽约艾德威尔德国际机场载重汽车司机工会的一千四百名会员分别举行了罢工，要求增加工资。纽约一万名清洁工人在7月27日和28日也举行了罢工，并在纽约市政厅门前举行了声势浩大的群众示威，要求改善待遇。8月2日，泛美航空公司也发生了职工因要求改善生活和劳动条件举行罢工的事。
    美国政府对导弹工人罢工感到不安。据8月1日“美国新闻和世界报道”的文章透露：“五角大楼就要进行干预，采取‘强硬’的方针，以终止这个导弹基地上工作的拖延。”“国防部已下令空军在必要时‘采用强硬手段制止争吵’……。”但是，在帝国主义国家国内阶级矛盾日趋尖锐的情况下，不论美国统治集团采取怎样的“强硬手段”，美国工人维护切身利益、改善生活条件的斗争是无法阻挡的。
