Effective Prevention and Control of Three Major Diseases of Chinese Cabbage
Zhai Xin, Deputy Director of Tianjin Municipal Non-Staple Food Management Committee

In 1958, the autumn vegetables planted in Tianjin suffered from severe diseases. First, the cruciferous virus occurred widely, followed by a large outbreak of downy mildew, and sporadic occurrences of soft rot. Because we lacked experience in prevention and control at the time, the autumn vegetable production was greatly reduced.

In 1959, the three major diseases of autumn vegetables occurred again. However, due to early preparation and comprehensive prevention and control, the development of the disease was effectively controlled, and a bumper harvest of Chinese cabbage was achieved. The 110,000 mu of Chinese cabbage in the near suburbs had an average yield of about 8,000 jin per mu, an increase of 23% over the bumper harvest of 1957 and more than double the yield of 1958. The ability to achieve such a great victory in 1959 was mainly due to conscientiously learning from the lessons of 1958 and initially figuring out the patterns and characteristics of the three major diseases of autumn vegetables.

We found that the occurrence of viruses in Chinese cabbage is most serious under "high temperature and dry" conditions. The suitable temperature for the disease to occur is around 28 degrees Celsius. In years when there is no rain in mid-August, viruses will occur in large numbers. In 1958, there were only two light rains in mid-August, so it was a year of major virus outbreaks. Conversely, in 1957, there were six rains in mid-August, totaling 72.4 millimeters, and the virus did not occur.

The occurrence conditions of downy mildew are exactly the opposite of those of viruses. It occurs in large numbers under "low temperature and humid" conditions. The suitable temperature is 8 to 16 degrees Celsius. The temperature and rainfall from late August to late September are closely related to the occurrence of downy mildew. The downy mildew in 1958 broke out after a rain on September 14, and became more serious with each subsequent rain. In the same period of 1957, although there were five rains, the total rainfall was only 4.8 millimeters, a difference of almost five times, and downy mildew basically did not occur.

Soft rot occurs in "humid" environments. In the early stage of Tianjin cabbage production in 1958, the temperature was very high, above 25 degrees Celsius, and in the later stage it was as low as 15 degrees Celsius, but soft rot occurred in both stages. It seems that the key to the disease is humidity.

On the basis of initially figuring out the patterns of disease occurrence, after investigation, we further summarized the experience of the masses in fighting against diseases and found prevention and control methods, which can be summarized in the following two aspects:

First, enhance the disease resistance of Chinese cabbage. The main focus is on timely sowing, cultivating strong seedlings, and strengthening the management of the rosette stage, so that the plants can grow strong in the most suitable environment.

Second, eliminate the source of infection. This mainly involves eliminating underground and above-ground pests, eliminating disease centers, and using chemical control to reduce or eliminate the source of the three major diseases.

The bumper harvest of Chinese cabbage in 1959 was also the result of strengthening the leadership of the Party and launching a mass movement.

I. As early as February 1959, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee issued instructions on the prevention and control of the three major diseases. In order to strengthen the leadership of vegetable work, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee, a three-person leading group was established, and vegetable production organizations were established and improved in various districts and communes. In July, before the sowing of autumn vegetables, the agricultural department held an autumn vegetable cultivation meeting focusing on the prevention and control of the three major diseases and formulated specific prevention and control measures. At all stages of autumn vegetable production, Party and government leading cadres went to the front line to seize opportunities and key points, grasping from sowing to harvesting until the end. When the Chinese cabbage harvesting season arrived, farmers generally reflected that: "If it weren't for listening to the Party, the three major diseases would have been as rampant as last year."

II. The struggle against the three major diseases is also a process of constantly fighting against various incorrect ideas. When the three major diseases began to occur in 1959, some cadres believed that a few spots of disease did not matter, and some farmers had blindly optimistic sentiments. By early September, when the white-veined cabbage disease was serious and the green-veined cabbage was also generally diseased, the masses developed feelings of fear and pessimism. These ideological problems were only solved through several on-site meetings or "comparison and lesson fields." The Party branch of Tianmu Village Production Team in Hongqiao District selected 1.7 mu of land with the most serious occurrence of pests and diseases for experimentation. They sprayed medicine on one mu of land and left 0.7 mu of land unsprayed. Three days later, they held another on-site meeting. Everyone saw that the insects on the one mu of land that had been sprayed with medicine were all eliminated, and the disease had been stopped; the disease on the 0.7 mu of land that had not been sprayed with medicine was even more serious, and most of the leaves had withered. In this way, each small team scrambled for pesticides, sprayers, and medicine, and sprayed 310 mu of cabbage in just two days and nights. Many other communes also improved the masses' understanding through such on-site meetings, thereby enabling the prevention and control work to be carried out quickly.

III. Technical work can only be mastered by the broad masses and play its due role when it is closely integrated with production practice. In the prevention and control of the three major diseases, we resolutely implemented the mass line, listened to the opinions of the masses at all times, and while improving the masses' understanding, we systematically improved the masses' experiences and methods, and then implemented them among the masses, so that technology took root among the masses and formed a mass prevention and control movement. Before the comprehensive prevention and control of the three major diseases, the suburban farmers believed that there was no way to treat the three major diseases. After the prevention and control movement was launched, everyone knew that the three major diseases could also be prevented and controlled. "Scheelite," "Bordeaux mixture," and "copper soap solution" became household names for disease prevention pesticides.

    白菜三大病害可以有效防治
    天津市副食品管理委员会副主任　翟新
    1958年天津市种的秋菜发生了严重的病害。先是十字花科病毒普遍发生，随后霜霉病又大量出现，软腐病也点片发生。因为当时我们缺乏防治经验，秋菜减产很多。
    1959年秋菜三大病害再度发生。但是，由于早有准备，进行了全面防治，有效地控制了病情的发展，使大白菜获得了大丰收。近郊区十一万亩大白菜，平均亩产八千斤左右，比丰收的1957年单产增加23％，比1958年的单产增加了一倍还多。1959年能够取得这样巨大的胜利，主要是认真吸取1958年的教训，初步摸出了秋菜三大病害的规律以及发病特点。
    我们发现白菜发生病毒，在“高温干燥”的环境下最为严重。发病的适宜温度是在二十八度（摄氏）左右，凡是8月中旬无雨的年头，病毒就会大量发生。1958年8月中旬只下两次微雨，因此是病毒的大发生年；相反，1957年8月中旬降雨达六次、七十二点四毫米之多，病毒便没有发生。
    霜霉病同病毒的发生条件刚好相反，它是在“低温多湿”的条件下大量发生。适宜温度是八至十六度（摄氏），8月下旬到9月下旬的气温与降雨对霜霉病的发生有密切关系。1958年的霜霉病是在9月14日一场雨后大量发生的，以后每降雨一次就严重一次。1957年同期降雨量虽然也有五次，但共降雨仅四点八毫米，雨量相差几乎五倍，霜霉病基本上没有发生。
    软腐病发生在“多湿”的环境。1958年天津白菜生产的前期，温度很高，在二十五度（摄氏）以上，后期又低到十五度（摄氏），但都发生了软腐病，看来发病的关键还是湿度。
    我们在初步摸清发病规律的基础上，经过了调查，进一步总结群众同病害作斗争的经验，找出了防治的方法，总起来有以下两方面：
    一，增强大白菜的抗病力。主要抓适期播种，培育壮苗，加强莲座期的管理，使植株能在最适宜的环境下成长健壮。
    二，消灭病源。主要是从消灭地下和地上害虫，消灭发病中心，药剂防治三个方面着手，使三大病害的病源减少或消灭。
    1959年大白菜的丰收，又是我们加强党的领导，大搞群众运动的结果。
    一、早在1959年2月，天津市委就发出防治三大病害的指示。市委为了加强对蔬菜工作的领导，在市委与市人委的领导下，成立了三人领导小组，各区社也都建立和健全了蔬菜生产组织。7月间，在秋菜播种以前，农业部门又召开了以防治三大病害为中心的秋菜栽培会议，制定了具体防治措施。在秋菜生产各个环节上，党政领导干部都亲上前线，抓时机，抓关键，从种抓到收一抓到底。到了大白菜收获季节，农民普遍反映说：“今年要不是听党的话，三大病害又会像去年一样猖狂。”
    二、与三大病害作斗争，也是不断向各种不正确思想作斗争的过程。1959年三大病害开始发生时，有些干部认为一星半点的病没有关系，一部分农民存在盲目乐观情绪。到9月上旬白麻叶白菜病情严重，青麻叶白菜也普遍发病，群众又产生了畏难和悲观思想。这些思想问题，都是通过若干的现场会或“对比教训田”才得到解决的。红桥区天木村生产队党支部选定病虫害发生最严重的一亩七分地作试验，对其中一亩地打了药，留下七分地不打药；三天后又召开一次现场会，大家一看：打了药的一亩地，虫子全部消灭，病害已被制止；未打药的七分地，病情更加严重了，叶子大部塌了秧。这样，各小队都争着要农药、要药械和喷用药，只两昼夜便把三百一十亩白菜打了一遍药。其他许多公社也是通过这样的现场会后，提高了群众认识，从而使得防治工作迅速得到开展。
    三、技术工作只有与生产实践密切结合，才能为广大群众所掌握，发挥应有作用。我们在防治三大病害中坚决贯彻群众路线，时刻听取群众的意见，一面提高群众认识，一面又把群众的经验办法加以系统提高，再贯彻到群众中去，使技术在群众中扎了根，形成了群众性的防治运动。全面防治三大病害以前，郊区农民对三大病害都认为没有办法可治，开展防治运动以后，人人皆知三大病害也能防治，
  “什来特”“波尔多液”“铜皂液”成为家喻户晓的防病农药。
