Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: The people in the drought-affected areas of Hubei Province, under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, have launched a struggle against drought. The broad masses of people's commune members are determined to fight drought wherever it occurs, and to fight drought until it ends, to overcome the drought demon and strive for a bumper harvest.

Currently, mid-season rice is at the crucial "spoonful of water, bowl of grain" stage; single-season late rice is beginning to bud, cotton is developing autumn bolls, and double-season late rice, sweet potatoes, and late autumn coarse grains are being transplanted and sown or are in the seedling development stage, all of which require extreme amounts of water. However, since mid-July, rainfall in various areas has been scarce, and autumn crops, especially rice, have been threatened by drought. The heroic people of Hubei, who withstood the severe drought last year, have paid serious attention to this year's drought as soon as it began to appear. Based on last year's experience in fighting drought, various localities immediately established drought prevention and control headquarters to lead the drought prevention and control efforts. Party secretaries and leading cadres at all levels have also gone to the front lines of drought relief, working alongside the masses to combat drought, and promptly identifying and resolving problems. Liu Xiaofa, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Erhe People's Commune in Hanchuan County, Wuhan area, went deep into the Weicheng Production Team, where water sources were scarce, and, together with the commune members, found a water source in Chen Lake, enabling the entire team's more than 900 mu of mid-season rice to be irrigated once or twice. Under Liu Xiaofa's leadership, cadres throughout the commune went into the fields and carried out drought relief work with the commune members. 70% of the drought-affected farmland in the commune has now been irrigated.

In the struggle against drought, various localities are relying on the superiority of the people's communes and actively utilizing existing water conservancy projects. The Jingzhou area alone has successively opened 78 large and small sluice gates, introducing large amounts of river water and lake water to irrigate large areas of drought-affected farmland. In Mianyang County, thanks to the power of the people's communes, a large number of ditches and dams were repaired in a concentrated effort, enabling the original water conservancy projects to play a better role. Not only has the water problem for all drought-affected farmland in the county been solved, but 300,000 mu of farmland has also been provided with self-flowing irrigation. Relying on the power of the people's communes, Huangpi County has recently built more than 2,400 dams to block rivers, expanding the irrigated area.

Many factories in drought-affected areas are making the manufacture and repair of drought relief tools their top priority. Shashi recently transferred a large number of technicians, led by He Min, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, to the front lines of drought relief to help farmers solve problems with the repair and installation of drainage and irrigation equipment and agricultural machinery, supporting the drought relief struggle.

    旱到哪里抗到哪里　旱到何时抗到何时
    湖北千方百计抗旱保粮
    据新华社武汉讯　湖北省部分受旱地区的人民群众，在各级党组织的领导下，展开了抗旱斗争。广大人民公社社员，决心旱到哪里，抗到哪里，旱到何时，抗到何时，战胜旱魔，力争丰收。
    现在，中稻正处在“瓢水碗谷”的紧要关头；一季晚稻开始孕穗，棉花正在大结秋桃，双季晚稻、甘薯和晚秋杂粮正在抢插抢种和幼苗发育阶段，都极端需水。但是，从7月中旬以来，各地雨量很少，大秋作物特别是水稻已经受到干旱的威胁。经过去年特大干旱考验的英雄的湖北人民，当今年干旱刚刚露头的时候，就引起了严重注意。各地根据去年抗旱的经验，立即成立防旱抗旱指挥部，领导防旱抗旱斗争。各级党委书记和主要负责干部，也纷纷深入抗旱第一线，同群众一道抗旱，及时发现问题和解决问题。武汉地区汉川县二河公社党委书记刘晓发，深入到水源较差的卫成生产队，同社员一起到沉湖找到了水源，使全队九百多亩中稻普遍灌了一、两次水。全社干部在刘晓发的带动下，都深入田间，和社员一道进行抗旱斗争，全社受旱田亩已有70％得到了灌溉。
    各地在抗旱斗争中依靠人民公社的优越性，积极发挥现有的水利工程的作用。仅荆州地区即已先后开放大小水闸七十八处，引进大量江水、河水和湖水，浇灌了大片受旱的农田。沔阳县由于依靠人民公社力量，突击修整了大批沟渠、水坝等，使原有水利工程更好地发挥了作用，全县不仅受旱农田的用水问题全部得到解决，还使其中三十万亩耕地得到自流灌溉。黄陂县依靠人民公社的威力，最近已拦河筑坝两千四百多处，扩大了灌溉面积。
    受旱地区很多工厂都把制造、修理抗旱工具作为首要任务。沙市最近便抽调大批技术工人由市委书记处书记贺民带领，奔赴抗旱前线，帮助农民解决排灌设备、农业机械的修理安装问题，支援抗旱斗争。（附图片）
