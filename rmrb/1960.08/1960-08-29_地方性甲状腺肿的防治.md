    Prevention and Treatment of Endemic Goiter
    Fu Lianzhang
  The thyroid gland is the largest endocrine gland in the human body, located in the middle of the front of the neck, close to both sides of the trachea. Normally, it is not visible from the outside. Endemic goiter is a disease of the thyroid gland, mainly caused by the pathological enlargement of the thyroid gland due to iodine deficiency in the body. This type of goiter usually does not have significant changes in metabolic rate or other symptoms, so it is also called simple goiter, commonly known as "big neck disease." This type of goiter is called endemic because it is more likely to occur in plateaus, mountains, and places far from the sea. In China, it is more common in the southwest, northwest, north China, and northeast. I remember more than twenty years ago, when the Long March passed through Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan and other provinces, I saw that this disease was quite prevalent locally. In addition, it is often encountered in western Fujian.
    In the history of medicine, traditional Chinese medicine had the earliest understanding of endemic goiter in the world. As early as 2,400 years ago, it was described in Zhuangzi, where the disease was called "ying disease," meaning a sac-like tumor growing on the neck. In Europe, the first record of residents in the Alps suffering from this disease did not appear until the tenth century AD. China also recorded the earliest methods for treating endemic goiter in the world. In Ge Hong's "Emergency Formulas to Keep Up One's Sleeve" of the Jin Dynasty, the treatment of this disease with wine-soaked seaweed was first introduced. In the Jin Dynasty, Zhang Congzheng further used seaweed to prevent this disease. As for Europe, there were records of treating it with burnt ash of seaweed and sponges in the twelfth century. Li Shizhen, the great Chinese pharmacologist, summarized the use of drugs such as seaweed, kelp, and kunbu to treat this disease in his masterpiece "Compendium of Materia Medica." According to modern scientific analysis, these drugs all contain more iodine. Thus, it can be seen that the treatment methods in China more than 1,500 years ago are completely consistent with the principles of modern medicine.
    As mentioned earlier, the occurrence of this disease is mainly due to iodine deficiency in the body. The following are the main factors that cause iodine deficiency in the body: The first situation is that the iodine supplied to the body is insufficient. In some areas, the low iodine content in water, table salt, soil, and agricultural products leads to iodine deficiency in the human body. According to modern chemical analysis, the lower the iodine content in the water, the higher the incidence of goiter. The second situation is during development, pregnancy, and lactation, the increased need for iodine may cause iodine deficiency and lead to goiter. The third situation is that excessive calcium and fat content in food may affect iodine absorption.
    The thyroid gland is the organ that produces thyroid hormones, and its main function is to regulate oxidation in the body. Patients with endemic goiter generally do not feel any symptoms other than thyroid enlargement in the early stages. When the thyroid gland is severely enlarged, it will compress surrounding tissues, causing cough, difficulty breathing, and difficulty swallowing.
    Although this disease does not have any symptoms at the beginning, it should still be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Because this disease is very easy to cure completely in the early stages. If it is not treated in time, the enlarged thyroid gland will become even larger, and over time, it may develop into nodular goiter, which may then turn into a malignant cancer. On the other hand, it may turn into hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Women with this disease will affect the growth and development of the fetus, and the children born may be very short and slow. Some patients may experience sudden bleeding in the thyroid gland, causing gland enlargement and acute pain. Although such evolutions are relatively rare, they can be completely avoided if attention is paid to prevention and early treatment.
    Although endemic goiter can be completely cured by internal medicine methods in the early stage, prevention is more effective. Especially in endemic areas, prevention work must be vigorously promoted. There are many prevention methods, among which eating iodized salt is the most effective and convenient. Adding a certain amount of iodine to table salt can prevent and treat this disease and prevent recurrence after cure. In addition, seafood contains a large amount of iodine, especially kelp, which contains more iodine. Coastal areas in China are extremely rich in seafood. How to organize the supply of seafood to inland areas also has a good effect on the prevention and treatment of this disease. In the later stage, if the effect of internal medicine treatment is not good, surgical treatment should be considered, which should be determined according to the specific situation of each patient.
    Since the liberation of the whole country, thanks to the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the principle of prevention first has been implemented in health work. Surveys and studies have been conducted on this disease in many regions of the country. The People's Government supplies iodized salt in epidemic areas. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, great achievements have been made in vigorously preventing and controlling the disease by using both indigenous and foreign methods. Under our superior socialist system, scientific and technological progress is constantly leaping forward. We can not only turn deserts into fertile fields, but we will also be able to use scientific methods to change the natural conditions such as water and soil in those iodine-deficient areas. I believe that endemic goiter will eventually be eliminated.

### 地方性甲状腺肿的防治

    地方性甲状腺肿的防治
    傅连暲
  甲状腺是人体内最大的一种内分泌腺，位于颈前部的正中，贴近气管的两旁，在正常时从外表一般是看不出的。地方性甲状腺肿是甲状腺的一种疾病，主要是由于体内缺乏碘质而引起甲状腺的病理性肿大。这种甲状腺肿通常没有新陈代谢率的显著改变或其他症状，所以又称为单纯性甲状腺肿，俗称为“大脖子病”。这种甲状腺肿之所以称为地方性，是因为在高原、山地离海较远的地方更易发生。在我国以西南、西北、华北、东北等地较多见。记得在二十多年前长征经过贵州、云南、四川等省时，看到这种病在当地相当流行，此外在福建西部也常遇见。
    在医学史上，祖国医学对于地方性甲状腺肿的认识是世界上最早的。早在距今二千四百年前在庄子的记载中就已有过叙述，那时候称这种病为“瘿病”，意思是说生在脖子上呈囊状的瘤子；而在欧洲，到公元十世纪才首先有关于阿尔卑斯山区居民患此病的记录。世界上最早记载治疗地方性甲状腺肿的方法也是我国。在晋代葛洪的“肘后备急方”里，首先介绍了用海藻的酒浸液治疗此病，而到金代张从正氏则更进一步地利用海藻来预防此病。至于欧洲，是在十二世纪才有了用海藻、海绵的烧灰治疗的记录。我国伟大的医药学家李时珍在他的巨著《本草纲目》中归纳海藻、海带、昆布等药物治疗此病。根据现代科学分析，证明这些药物中都含有较多的碘质，由此可见我国在一千五百多年前的治疗方法，和现代医学的治疗原则是完全相符合的。
    前面已经谈到这种病的发生主要是由于体内缺乏碘质的缘故，下面几种情况是引起体内缺碘的主要因素：第一种情况是因为供给身体的碘不足，在一些地区，由于水、食盐、土壤和农产品中含碘量低，造成人体缺碘。根据现代化学分析，证明在水中含碘量越少的地区，甲状腺肿的发病率也越高。第二种情况是在发育、妊娠、哺乳期间，由于对碘的需要量增加了，可能形成缺碘而引起甲状腺肿大。第三种情况是因为食物中钙质、脂肪含量过高，可能影响碘的吸收。
    甲状腺是制造甲状腺素的器官，它主要功能是调节体内氧化作用。患地方性甲状腺肿的病人，在早期除了甲状腺肿大外，病人一般是不觉得有什么症状的。在甲状腺肿大得很厉害时，则会压迫周围组织产生咳嗽、呼吸和吞咽困难。
    这种病虽然开始时没有什么症状，但是仍应该及早加以诊治。因为这种病在早期是很容易完全可以治愈的。如不及时治疗，那么肿大的甲状腺就会更加肿大，而且时间长久以后可能演变为结节性甲状腺肿，这样也就有转变为恶性癌肿的可能，另一方面也可能转变成甲状腺功能过高或过低；妇女患有这种病则会影响胎儿的生长发育，生下的小孩可能很矮小迟钝。还有些病人，可能在甲状腺内发生骤然的出血，引起腺体增大和急性疼痛。虽然这样的演变是比较少的，但如果注意预防和早期治疗，就可以完全避免它的发生。
    地方性甲状腺肿早期虽可经内科方法完全治愈，但不如预防有效。尤其在地方病区，必须大力推行预防工作。预防方法有多种，其中以食用含碘的食盐最为有效而方便，在食盐中加入一定量的碘，就可以预防和治疗这种疾患，并且可以防止治愈后的复发。此外海产食物中含有大量的碘质，特别是海带含碘更多，而我国沿海地区海产极为丰富，如何组织海产货源运送至内陆地区，对这疾病的防治也有良好的作用。在较后期如内科治疗效果不好则应考虑采用外科治疗，这要根据每个病人的具体情况来决定。
    全国解放后，由于党和毛主席的英明领导，卫生工作贯彻了预防为主的方针，在全国许多地区对此病进行调查研究，人民政府在流行地区供应含碘的食盐，尤其是从大跃进以来，用土洋并举的办法大力防治，已取得了很大成绩。在我们优越的社会主义制度下，科学技术不断的飞跃发展，我们既能够变沙漠为良田，我们也必然能够用科学的方法改变那些缺碘地区的水分和土壤等自然条件。我相信，地区性甲状腺肿这种疾病终将被消灭。
