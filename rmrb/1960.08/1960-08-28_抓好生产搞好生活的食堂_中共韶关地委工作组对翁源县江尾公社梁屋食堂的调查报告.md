	Run a Canteen That Catches Production Well and Takes Care of Life
	Investigation Report on Liangwu Canteen of Jiangwei Commune, Wengyuan County by the CPC Shaoguan Prefectural Committee Work Group

	Editor's Note: The experience of Liangwu Canteen in Jiangwei Commune, Wengyuan County, Guangdong Province, is worth learning from.

	The experience of Liangwu Canteen shows that doing a good job in collective production is the material basis for running a public canteen well, and running a public canteen well will inevitably in turn become an important guarantee for promoting collective production.

	The comrades of Liangwu Canteen deeply understand this point, adhere to the correct path of organizing collective life and the class line, adhere to putting politics in command and doing a good job in canteen production, and arrange the lives of the commune members very well. Not only is everyone fed well, but even the hemp used for making shoes, the tobacco smoked by the commune members, and the ginger used by pregnant women are arranged properly. Last year alone, the sale of surplus products from the canteen allowed each person to receive an average of more than nine yuan in pocket money. With the canteen running well, the commune members were excited and their enthusiasm for production was greatly enhanced. Therefore, the team's production has been very good for many years, and it has always been a leading team in production.

	The key to running a public canteen well lies in cadres having a strong will and good working methods and style. This is another basic experience proven by Liangwu Canteen. The cadres there went deep into the "four togethers," promoted democracy, took the lead in labor, and wholeheartedly ran the canteen well, while they themselves were so selfless and worked so hard. Therefore, under their influence, the idea of commune members loving the canteen as they love their home has become a common practice, causing profound changes in people's mental outlook and interpersonal relationships.

	Canteen Runs Well, Production Enthusiasm is High
	Liangwu Canteen in Jiangwei Commune, Wengyuan County, Guangdong Province, is a red flag canteen. This canteen was established in the spring of 1955 on the basis of a perennial mutual aid group. After communization, it was converted into a perennial canteen. For more than five years, under the correct leadership of the Party, they have adhered to the mass line, insisted on relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and made this canteen bigger and better, and more and more consolidated. The canteen has a solid economic foundation and abundant non-staple food, so that the commune members can eat their fill and eat well; the canteen has a relatively large economic income, which not only solves the problem of oil and salt money, but also gives the commune members a part of pocket money. Because the canteen is well run, the commune members consciously hand over their private plots to the canteen for management, so that the canteen economy has further developed. The commune members are all in a happy mood and love the canteen. Since the conversion to a perennial canteen, none of the 36 households and 164 people in the team have withdrawn from the canteen, and everyone feels that the canteen is their warm family. Because the canteen is well run and the lives of the commune members are well arranged, the commune members are wholeheartedly engaged in production, and their enthusiasm lasts for a long time. Therefore, Liangwu Team has achieved bumper harvests year after year. In 1956, this production team was still a grain-deficient team, with an annual rice output of more than 60,000 jin, and the state sold 12,000 jin of grain that year; in 1958, the total annual rice output reached 96,000 jin, and it began to change from a grain-deficient team to a surplus grain team, selling more than 20,000 jin of surplus grain to the state; in 1959, it overfulfilled the production contract task assigned by the brigade, and was commended by the brigade and received a bonus of 530 yuan, and was rated as an advanced production contract team of the commune and the brigade. This year's summer grain has also achieved a bumper harvest, and 40,000 jin of surplus grain can be sold in one season.

	Vegetables Cannot Be Eaten Up, Pigs Are Fat, Chickens and Ducks Are Many
	The Liangwu Canteen is so outstanding because the canteen production is outstanding first. On the basis of doing a good job in canteen production, the canteen management is done well. This canteen grows vegetables well, raises pigs well, raises chickens and ducks well, and solves the edible oil problem well. In addition to being completely self-sufficient in vegetables, pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese, it also provides a large number of commodities to the state. Taking vegetable planting as an example, the canteen has a total of more than 13 mu, with an average of 8 li of vegetable land per person, and arranges three and a half labor forces to be responsible for management. Due to diligent management and skillful arrangement, more than a dozen kinds of fresh melons and seasonal vegetables cannot be eaten up all year round, with an average of two jin of vegetables per person per day. There are now as many as eight kinds of vegetables that can be eaten, including both coarse vegetables such as amaranth, water spinach, and wheat vegetables, and fine vegetables such as eggplant, pepper, leek, cucumber, and cowpea. In addition to being completely self-sufficient in fresh vegetables, a lot of pickles and dried vegetables are also made; the canteen also supplies surplus vegetables to other communes and market towns, factories and mines. Last year, the sale of vegetables earned a total of 1,520 yuan.

	The canteen's animal husbandry production is also booming. Last year, 80 pigs were raised, with an average of more than two pigs per household; 426 chickens, ducks, and geese, 100 rabbits, and two boxes of bees. In addition to completely solving its own meat needs, the canteen's animal husbandry production sold 43 meat pigs to the state throughout the year, with an average of more than one pig per household, overfulfilling the state procurement task by 70%. Throughout the year, 170 chickens and ducks were sold to the state, with an average of 4.7 per household. This year's animal husbandry production has been developed to "ten major breedings" (i.e., breeding pigs, chickens, domestic ducks, Muscovy ducks, geese, rabbits, dogs, cats, bees, and fish) on the basis of the six items of last year. In addition to the canteen's self-sufficiency, it is also preparing to sell to the state.

	The canteen also takes out a large part of its income to give to the commune members as pocket money. Last year, the pocket money given to the commune members averaged 9.2 yuan per person.

	In addition to managing food well, the canteen also cares for the lives of the commune members in all aspects. For example, the canteen grows a small amount of ginger, and every woman in childbirth can be taken care of and receive about ten jin of ginger; the canteen grows a small amount of jute, and each woman receives three jin, so there is no need to worry about having no thread for making shoes; the canteen grows a small amount of raw tobacco, and the commune members who smoke were given four jin of tobacco per person last year. Usually, the canteen also prepares some special foods for the elderly, the sick, pregnant women, and women in childbirth. Because the canteen cares for the commune members meticulously and is considerate of them, the commune members wholeheartedly love this warm big family. The commune members said: "The canteen is more thoughtful than we ourselves."

	In order to arrange the lives of the commune members better, this year the team and the canteen have reclaimed and planted more than 20 mu of sweet potatoes under the premise of completing the grain production tasks assigned by the brigade, and plan to expand to more than 30 mu. In addition, they have also used the land around the fields to plant arrowroot, taro, corn and other miscellaneous grains, and intercropped a large amount of hyacinth beans in the sweet potato fields. The income of grain and oil crops are all supplied to the canteen.

	The Canteen Environment is Beautiful, Meetings and Learning
	Liangwu Canteen is in a new house on a small slope next to Liangwu Village. It was built by the commune members who fought hard day and night in 1958 during communization. The environment is very beautiful, with a lush green sand pear orchard in front and a small river not far away. The inside of the canteen is arranged neatly and cleanly. The commune members like this canteen very much. In addition to eating three meals a day here, they also rest and enjoy the cool air in the canteen. In the evening, they discuss problems, study culture, talk about current events, read newspapers, and hold recreational activities in the canteen. This is not only a canteen, but also a classroom; it is not only a meeting place, but also a recreational place. Every time after school and after meals, dozens of children in the kindergarten like to sing and dance here; the elderly stroke their beards and wave their fans to tell stories, talking about the past and the present, making this big family very happy and harmonious.

	The Canteen Runs Well, All Rely on the Leadership of the Party
	The development and consolidation of Liangwu Canteen has not been smooth sailing. In terms of foundation, the natural conditions of this production team are not good. Nearly 40% of the fields are "fields waiting for rain" without water, and the yield was very low in the past. Every year, the state had to sell 12,000 jin of grain. The income level of the commune members is not high either. During the period of the advanced cooperative, 70% of the commune members were overspending households. There are very few dams here, and there were not many varieties of vegetables originally planted. There were only a few kinds of coarse vegetables such as wheat vegetables, amaranth, and water spinach, and the quantity was also limited. Under such conditions, being able to run the canteen so well is mainly the result of many twists and turns of struggle and hard work under the leadership of the Party. In the autumn of 1958, this canteen changed from a canteen of more than 20 households to a canteen in which all the commune members participated. Some of the upper-middle peasants hesitated after participating. Liang Diansheng, an upper-middle peasant, said: "My family of twelve people often argues and makes trouble to separate the family. I don't have the ability to put more than 100 people together." At that time, in the upsurge of communization, although these upper-middle peasants reluctantly followed the crowd to participate in the canteen, they were "in the canteen, but their hearts were at home." As soon as there was any disturbance, they took the opportunity to make trouble. Last spring, when the hierarchical management system was implemented, these people took advantage of loopholes to carry out "canteen decentralization." At that time, in order to keep the canteen going, the team leaders' first measure was to emphasize putting politics in command, relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and carrying out a struggle against the wavering ideas of some upper-middle peasants. At that time, Liang Yuancheng, the general branch committee member and team leader, proposed: "Even if there are only ten or eight poor peasant households left, we must persist in running the canteen." His determination was supported by the poor and lower-middle peasants of the whole team. A big debate on "whether to run the canteen well" was launched in the whole team, and the evil trend at that time was resisted. The team leaders accepted this experience and lesson, strengthened leadership, established a canteen management committee consisting of seven people including the deputy secretary of the brigade (assigned to the team) and the party member team leader, and selected poor and lower-middle peasant activists to take on the work of the canteen.

	To truly show the superiority of the canteen, it is necessary to focus on production and life, establish the canteen's foundation, and make the production level and living standards catch up with and exceed the level of the upper-middle peasants, so that the canteen can have greater superiority. Liangwu Canteen is because the production is outstanding, and the living standards and production have greatly exceeded the level of the upper-middle peasants. Therefore, Liang Diansheng, the upper-middle peasant who was originally wavering, also saw that the canteen was good and said that he would no longer waver.

	Good Cadre Leadership, Strong Democratic Management
	The Liangwu Canteen can be run so well, and it is inseparable from the excellent work style of the cadres here. Liang Yuancheng, the general branch committee member and team leader, not only went deep into the canteen to work as a cook, but also often listened to the opinions of the masses and constantly improved the work of the canteen. The other cadres and party members of the team are also good at following the mass line, listening to the opinions of the masses, and trying their best to meet these requirements. At first, the canteen's meals were relatively monotonous. They did their best, following the principle of planned grain use, and providing both dry and thin meals at each meal according to the needs of the commune members, allowing the commune members to choose. Because the canteen planted more vegetables and raised more pigs, the meals were constantly improved.

	Promoting democracy and implementing democratic management is another important experience of Liangwu Canteen. In the process of running the canteen for several years, they have gradually established a set of democratic management system for the canteen. For example, in terms of financial management, a small summary is made every ten days, and accounts are announced every month. The accounts have been clear since the canteen was opened. In terms of grain management, the grain indicators are truly assigned to each household, the canteen is in unified custody, and the commune members have complete control over how much they eat. The surplus belongs to the commune members themselves. The canteen lists the names of each household on the blackboard as a unit. How much rice and porridge each meal is willing to eat is filled in the blank space by themselves, and the cooks make the rice according to the quantity. In this way, what to eat and how much to eat at each meal are completely in line with the wishes of the commune members, and at the same time, grain can be saved. In the first half of this year, 27 households in the whole team saved grain, with a total of 591 jin of grain saved. In terms of the expenditure of canteen funds, they have also set out approval limits, stipulating that any expenditure exceeding 50 yuan must be approved by the commune member congress; expenditures from 10 yuan to 50 yuan must be approved by the representative meeting; expenditures from 5 yuan to 10 yuan must be approved by the management committee; and expenditures below 5 yuan must be approved by the team leader.

	Hearts and Minds to the Collective, Everyone for Everyone
	After the canteen was run well, the production and living conditions changed greatly, and the mental outlook of the people also changed greatly. The ideas of loving the commune, loving the canteen, and loving the collective are growing. For example, the commune members originally had some private plots, but because the vegetables grown by the canteen were better and more than those grown by individuals, the pigs raised by the canteen were better and more than those raised by individuals, and the canteen arranged everyone's production and life properly and thoughtfully, and production and life had exceeded the level of the upper-middle peasants. Therefore, the commune members felt that their own operation of the private plots was not only not as good as the canteen, but also took a lot of time every day. From August of last year, everyone automatically handed over all the private plots to the canteen for management, and all the commune members wholeheartedly engaged in collective production.

	New ideas of hearts and minds to the collective and everyone for everyone are also constantly growing and developing. The sweet potatoes picked up by the commune members in the fields, the fish and shrimps caught by the children, and the firewood picked up are all consciously handed over to the canteen for distribution.

    抓好生产搞好生活的食堂
    中共韶关地委工作组对翁源县江尾公社梁屋食堂的调查报告
    编者按：广东翁源县江尾公社梁屋食堂的经验，值得大家学习。
    梁屋食堂的经验表明：搞好集体生产是办好公共食堂的物质基础，而办好公共食堂又必然要反过来成为促进集体生产的重要保证。
    梁屋食堂的同志们深深认识到这一点，坚持了组织集体生活的正确道路和阶级路线，坚持政治挂帅搞好食堂生产，把社员的生活安排得很好。不仅做到吃饱吃好，而且连做鞋用的麻、社员吸的烟、孕妇用的姜都安排得很妥善。仅去年出售食堂的多余产品就使每人平均分到九元多的零用钱。食堂办好了，社员兴高采烈，生产热情大为高涨。因而连年来全队生产搞得很好，一直是生产的上游队。
    办好公共食堂的关键在于干部要有坚强的意志和良好的工作方法与工作作风。这是为梁屋食堂证明了的又一条基本经验。那里的干部深入“四同”，发扬民主，带头劳动，全心全意办好食堂，而自己又如此地大公无私，艰苦朴素。因此，在他们的影响下，社员爱食堂如爱家的思想蔚然成风，在人们的精神面貌和人与人的关系中引起了深刻的变化。
    食堂办得好　生产干劲高
    广东翁源县江尾公社梁屋食堂是一个红旗食堂。这个食堂是在1955年春常年互助组的基础上办起来的。公社化后转为常年食堂。五年多来，在党的正确领导下，他们坚持走群众路线，坚持依靠贫农和下中农，把这个食堂由小到大，越办越好，越办越巩固。食堂经济雄厚，副食品丰富，社员吃得饱，吃得好；食堂经济收入较多，不但解决了油盐钱，同时还发给社员一部分零用钱。因为食堂办得好，社员都自觉地把自留地交给了食堂经营，使食堂经济进一步有了发展。社员个个心情舒畅，热爱食堂。自从转为常年食堂后，全队三十六户一百六十四人，没有一个社员退伙，大家都感到食堂就是自己的温暖家庭。由于食堂办得好，对社员生活安排得好，社员一心一意搞生产，干劲持久不衰，因此，梁屋小队连年获得丰收。1956年，这个生产队还是一个缺粮队，全年稻谷产量六万多斤，当年由国家统销粮食一万二千斤；1958年全年稻谷总产量达九万六千斤，开始由缺粮队变为余粮队，向国家出售余粮二万多斤；1959年超额完成了大队下达的包产任务，受到了大队的表扬，得到了五百三十元奖金，评为公社和大队的上游包产队。今年夏粮又获得了丰收，一季便可出售余粮四万斤。
    蔬菜吃不完　猪肥鸡鸭多
    梁屋食堂办得出色，首先是食堂生产搞得出色，在搞好食堂生产的基础上，搞好了食堂管理。这个食堂的蔬菜种得好，猪养得好，鸡鸭鹅养得好，食油问题解决得好。菜、猪、鸡、鸭、鹅等除全部自给外，还给国家提供了大量的商品。以种菜来说，食堂共种有十三亩多，平均每人有八厘菜地，安排三个半劳动力负责管理。由于勤管理、巧安排，十多种鲜瓜时菜，一年四季吃不完，平均一人一天有二斤菜。现在可以吃到的蔬菜有八种之多，既可以吃到苋菜、通心菜、麦菜等粗菜，也可吃到茄子、辣椒、韭菜、黄瓜、豆角等细菜。除鲜菜全部自给，并制了不少咸菜、干菜；食堂还把多余的蔬菜供应给别的公社和墟镇、工矿。去年出售的蔬菜共收入一千五百二十元。
    食堂的畜牧业生产也蓬勃发展。去年一年养猪八十头，平均一户二头多；鸡、鸭、鹅四百二十六只，兔子一百只，蜜蜂二箱。食堂的畜牧业生产除全部解决自己的肉食需要外，全年出售给国家肉猪四十三头，平均每户一头多，超额70％完成了国家派购任务。全年出售给国家鸡鸭一百七十只，平均每户四点七只。今年的畜牧业生产又在去年六个项目的基础上发展到“十大养”（即养猪、鸡、家鸭、番鸭、鹅、兔、狗、猫、蜜蜂、鱼）。产品除食堂自给外，还准备出售给国家。
    在食堂收入中，还拿出大部分来发给社员做零用钱。去年发给社员的零用钱，平均每人九元二角。
    食堂除了管好伙食之外，还从各方面来关心社员的生活。如食堂种有小量的姜，每个产妇都可以得到照顾，领到十斤左右生姜；食堂种有小量黄麻，每个妇女发三斤，做鞋就不愁没线用了；食堂种有小量生烟，抽烟的社员去年每人分到了四斤烟。平时，食堂还特别给老人、病人、孕妇、产妇等准备一些特殊的食品。由于食堂无微不至地关心社员，体贴社员，社员都衷心地热爱这个温暖的大家庭。社员说：“食堂比我们自己想的还要周到。”
    为了把社员的生活安排得更好，今年小队和食堂在完成大队分配的粮食生产任务的前提下，已开荒种下番薯二十多亩，计划再扩大到三十亩以上。另外，还利用五边地种上蕉芋、芋头、玉米等杂粮，在番薯地里间种了大量眉豆。收入的粮食和油料都供给食堂用。
    食堂环境美　开会又学习
    梁屋食堂在梁屋村旁小坡上的一幢新房子里。它是1958年公社化时社员苦战几昼夜亲手盖起来的。环境十分幽美，前面是一片浓绿的沙梨园，不远是一条小河。食堂里面布置得整齐清洁。社员十分喜欢这个食堂，除了一天三餐在这里吃饭外，休息、乘凉也多在食堂，晚上讨论问题、学文化、讲时事、读报纸、文娱活动等都在食堂进行。这里既是食堂，又是课堂；既是会场，又是文娱场。每当课余饭后，幼儿园的几十个孩子，喜欢在这里唱歌、跳舞；老年人捋须摇扇讲故事，论古说今，使这个大家庭显得十分欢乐融洽。
    食堂办得好　全靠党领导
    梁屋食堂从发展到巩固，并不是一帆风顺的。论底子，这个生产小队的自然条件不好，有近四成的田地是缺水的“望天田”，过去产量很低，每年要由国家统销一万二千斤粮食。社员的收入水平也不高，在高级社时，有70％的社员是超支户。这里坝地很少，原来种植的蔬菜品种不多，只有麦菜、苋菜、通心菜等几种粗菜，而且数量也有限。在这样的条件下，能够把食堂办得这样出色，主要是在党的领导下，经过了许多曲折的斗争和艰苦的工作的结果。1958年秋，这个食堂由二十多户社员的食堂成为全队社员都参加的食堂。一部分上中农参加后犹豫不决。上中农梁典生说：“我一家十二口人，还经常争争吵吵闹分家，想把一百多人合在一起，没有这样的本事。”当时在公社化的高潮中，这部分上中农虽然勉强随大流参加了食堂，却是“身在食堂，心在家”，一有什么风吹草动，就趁机会闹起来。去年春季，实行分级管理时，这部分人就钻空子要搞“食堂下放”。当时小队领导为了把食堂坚持下去，第一条措施就是强调政治挂帅，依靠贫农、下中农，同部分上中农的动摇思想开展斗争。当时总支委员、小队长梁远成提出：“就是留下十户八户贫农，也要坚持办下去。”他的决心得到了全队贫农和下中农的支持。在全队开展了一场“要不要办好食堂”的大辩论，把当时那股歪风顶了回去。小队领导接受了这次的经验教训，加强了领导，成立了包括大队副支书（分工驻小队）和党员小队长共七人的食堂管理委员会，并挑选出贫农、下中农积极分子来担任食堂工作。
    要真正显示食堂的优越性，必须突出抓好生产，抓好生活，建立食堂家底，使生产水平和生活水平都赶上和超过上中农水平，才能使食堂具有更大的优越性。梁屋食堂就是因为生产搞得突出，在生活上和生产上已经大大超过了上中农的水平，因此原来动摇不定的上中农梁典生，也看到食堂好，表示再不动摇了。
    干部领导好　民主管理强
    梁屋食堂能够办得这样出色，和这里干部的优良作风是分不开的。总支委员兼小队长梁远成同志不但深入食堂当炊事员，而且经常倾听群众的意见，不断改进食堂工作。小队的其他干部和党员，也善于走群众路线，听取群众的意见，并且千方百计来满足这些要求。开初，食堂的饭菜比较单调，他们就在计划用粮的原则下，按照社员的需要，做到每餐有干有稀，任由社员选择。由于食堂的蔬菜种多了，猪多了，饭食不断得到改进。
    发扬民主、实行民主管理，这是梁屋食堂办得好的又一条重要经验。在几年来办食堂的过程中，他们逐步建立了一套民主管理食堂的制度。例如，在财务管理方面，十天一小结，每月一公布账目，从办食堂到现在账目都清清楚楚。在粮食管理方面，真正做到粮食指标到户，食堂统一保管，吃多吃少完全由社员自己掌握，节余归社员自己。食堂以户为单位将各户的姓名列在黑板上，每餐愿意吃多少饭，多少粥，自己填写在空格里，炊事员便按照数量做饭。这样，每餐吃什么，吃多少，都做到完全符合社员的心意，同时还可以节约粮食。今年上半年全队节余粮食的就有二十七户，共节余粮食五百九十一斤。在食堂资金的开支方面，他们也订出了批准权限，规定凡超过五十元的开支，要经社员大会批准；十元至五十元的开支要经代表会批准；五至十元的开支，要经管委会批准；五元以下的由队长批准。
    心心向集体　人人为大家
    食堂办好之后，生产生活面貌大改变，人们的精神面貌也在大改变。热爱公社，热爱食堂，热爱集体的思想正在成长。例如社员原来都有一些自留地，但由于食堂种的菜比私人种的更好、更多，食堂的猪比私人的养得更好、更多，食堂把大家的生产和生活都安排得妥妥贴贴，十分周到，生产和生活都已超过了上中农水平。因此，社员感到自己经营自留地，不但不能比食堂好，反而每天还要花很多时间。从去年8月份开始，大家便自动把自留地全部交给食堂经营，全体社员都一心一意为集体生产。
    心心向集体、人人为大家的新思想也正在不断成长和发展。社员在田里拾到的番薯，小孩们捉到鱼虾、捡到柴火，都自觉地交给食堂支配。
