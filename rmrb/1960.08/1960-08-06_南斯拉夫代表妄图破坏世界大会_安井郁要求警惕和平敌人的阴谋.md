Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 4th: Yasui Kaoru told representatives from various countries attending the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament on August 3rd that the Yugoslav representative's behavior of expressing his intention to withdraw from the World Conference at the preparatory meeting on the 2nd was regrettable.

In order to sabotage the conference, the Yugoslav representative used the excuse that the conference did not read Tito's congratulatory message at the meeting on the 2nd to clamor to withdraw from the conference. According to the original plan of the conference executive committee, only the congratulatory messages from Khrushchev, Zhou Enlai, and Ho Chi Minh to the conference were to be read at the meeting on that day.

Yasui Kaoru said that this conference was to gather the forces of peace, and considering the situation of representatives from various countries, it was working according to democratic principles. The Yugoslav representative did not understand this. He pointed out that if representatives who came to participate in the conference withdrew from the conference at will, that would be an act of sabotage of the conference. Yasui Kaoru pointed out that the enemies of peace are trying to take the opportunity to sabotage, and we must never be used by the enemy. He called on representatives from various countries to strengthen unity for this purpose.

    南斯拉夫代表妄图破坏世界大会  安井郁要求警惕和平敌人的阴谋
    据新华社4日讯　东京消息：安井郁3日向出席第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的各国代表发表谈话说，南斯拉夫代表在2日的预备会议上表示要退出世界大会的行为是令人遗憾的。
  为了破坏这次大会，南斯拉夫代表以大会没有在2日会议上宣读铁托的贺电为借口，扬言要退出大会。按照大会执行委员会的原订计划，在这一天的会议上只宣读赫鲁晓夫、周恩来、胡志明给大会的贺电。
    安井郁说，这次大会是为了结集和平的力量，并且考虑到各国代表的情况，根据民主原则进行工作，南斯拉夫代表没有了解这一点。他指出，来参加大会的代表如果随意退出大会，那就是破坏大会的行为。安井郁指出，和平的敌人企图乘机破坏，我们绝不能为敌人所利用。他要求各国代表为此而加强团结。
