The Creation Experience of the Dance Drama "The Small Swords Society"
Bai Shui

Shanghai was one of the first cities invaded by imperialism. For over a century, the people of Shanghai, unwilling to be persecuted and exploited by imperialism, have carried out continuous revolutionary struggles, one after another. The Small Swords Society uprising in Shanghai from 1853 to 1855 was the first armed uprising of the Shanghai people against imperialism and feudal rule, and an important wing of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement. It dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary forces at home and abroad in their heartland. The uprising lasted for seventeen months before ultimately failing due to the depletion of food within the city. The leader, Liu Lichuan, also died heroically during the breakout. Although the uprising failed, the spirit of the Small Swords Society soldiers, who were brave, unyielding, and tenacious in their struggle, wrote a glorious page in the revolutionary history of the Shanghai people. Choosing this subject, on the one hand, we wanted to use the form of dance drama to show that in the early days of imperialism's invasion, the people of Shanghai had already experienced armed struggles like the Small Swords Society uprising. It demonstrated the spirit of resistance of the Chinese nation, which was unwilling to succumb to imperialism and its lackeys. This is something we can be proud of. On the other hand, this historical struggle still has positive practical significance for the present. Exposing and opposing imperialist aggression is an important task in our current struggle.

Dance drama art is the Party's weapon in the literary and artistic battle. It should reflect the struggles of the times and the revolutionary ideals of the people, and it should shape the image of great people's revolutionary heroes.

In order to powerfully reflect this historical revolutionary struggle, we read and studied various historical materials related to the Small Swords Society uprising. At the same time, we visited many elderly people and cultural center cadres in the area near Yu Garden, the former headquarters of the Small Swords Society uprising army, to inquire about the deeds of the uprising. We also went to the hometown of Zhou Xiuying, one of the heroes of the Small Swords Society, in Qingpu County, to learn about many touching deeds circulating among the people. These deeds deeply educated and inspired us.

There is a folk song in Qingpu praising the heroine Zhou Xiuying: "There is a Zhou Xiuying in Qingpu, wearing big red trousers and a small-collared shirt, wielding a big knife weighing hundreds of pounds, fighting on the Tangwan Bridge." This folk song not only vividly depicts the heroic image of Zhou Xiuying, but more importantly, it shows us how deeply connected the heroes of the Small Swords Society were with the people. The heroes of the Small Swords Society gave their lives for the people, and the people used songs to pass down these immortal heroic images from generation to generation, educating future generations to inherit the heroes' spirit of revolutionary struggle that never yields. The more we understood the struggle at that time, the more rich information we possessed, the more encouraged we were to reflect the revolutionary historical struggle and to sing the revolutionary optimism of the heroes at that time.

At the beginning of the creation work, we lacked experience, and were also influenced by some frameworks of Western dance drama structure methods. We believed that without the theme of love, dance dramas could not have pas de deux or solo dances, and would not have the characteristics of a dance drama, and would become too generic. Moreover, in the structure of the plot, because the depiction of love was only formalistic, in some places, the expression of the characters' feelings was handled incorrectly. For example, in the sixth scene: Shanghai was besieged by the enemy, and the soldiers of the Small Swords Society were engaged in a difficult struggle to defend the dangerous city. However, Zhou Xiuying, this heroic figure, was thinking of her lover. Upon learning the news of Pan Qixiang's sacrifice, she actually cried and collapsed on the ground in public, which seriously damaged the image of Zhou Xiuying, this heroic figure. Again, in the final scene, in order to move the audience, we overemphasized its tragic atmosphere, structuring it as: heavy snow flying, gloom and haze covering the sky. After a decisive battle, the leaders and soldiers of the Small Swords Society all sacrificed themselves. Finally, only Zhou Xiuying was left, holding the banner of "Obeying Heaven and Doing Justice," advancing alone and forlorn. As a result, the atmosphere of the entire play was low, sad, and brought the audience into a mood of pessimism and disappointment. These erroneous practices were essentially caused by the influence of bourgeois creative thinking. All problems stemmed from not starting from the content to determine the form, but from starting from frameworks, pursuing form. Therefore, it was impossible to correctly express the essence of the Small Swords Society uprising and its spirit of the times. When the Party and leaders discovered this tendency, they promptly pointed out that the dance drama should express the people's heroes in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle, closely linked to the masses, with an unyielding revolutionary fighting will and an optimistic spirit, so that the work would have the positiveness of realism. According to the Party's instructions, we determined the correct viewpoint of this subject matter, strengthened the historical background of the Small Swords Society uprising and the relationship between the army and the people, and highlighted the justice of the Small Swords Society uprising. The dance drama began with Qing soldiers forcing the people to hand over grain, leading to the people resisting the grain, and then leading to the scene of the people joining the uprising army and rising up in revolt. We added the plot of the Small Swords Society opening warehouses to distribute grain, as well as the people sending grain to support the uprising army, and deleted the scene of Zhou Xiuying's sorrow. We described Zhou Xiuying sharing weal and woe with the soldiers, sharing happiness. After receiving the news of Pan Qixiang's sacrifice, she turned grief into strength and rose up to break through the siege. Finally, we strengthened the tenacious spirit of the Small Swords Society uprising army fighting bloody battles and refusing to yield to death. At the end, we added a scene of the masses mourning Liu Lichuan and sending their sons to join the army, followed by Zhou Xiuying holding high the banner of "Obeying Heaven and Doing Justice," advancing towards the rising sun. In this way, although the ending of the play was a tragedy, and this struggle was temporarily defeated, it gave people a sense of tragic grandeur. The sparks were not extinguished, and the noble spirit would last forever, predicting that a larger-scale, earth-shattering revolutionary storm would surely come.

The two different handling methods are a very clear contrast, and also illustrate that the same subject matter, expressed with different standpoints, viewpoints, and handling methods, will produce two completely different results. This has further made us realize that we must transform our world outlook, we must use the correct world outlook to view the revolutionary historical struggle, and correctly reflect the historical facts of these struggles. This issue is truly a valuable experience and lesson for us to ponder deeply.

Reflected in the formal handling of the dance drama, there are also two different viewpoints. Some people, in terms of expressive methods, mechanically copied some foreign expressive techniques, so that some scenes rigidly used a large number of lifting movements; others believed that only Western orchestral music could complete the expressive task of dance drama music, and so on. This is a kind of view that believes in Western things and despises national things, which is not correct. Of course, we do not oppose learning from good foreign experiences, but we must digest them well and combine them with the content. For example, the bow dance in the sixth scene also used lifting to express the male soldiers helping the female soldiers practice archery, which seemed more natural and had national style, and looked more harmonious. The same is true in music. This time, in order to make the entire performance more national in character, we decided to use a national orchestra to accompany it. After the performance, the audience responded that "both seeing and hearing were very familiar," which made our understanding of nationalization and massification deepened another step.

In this creative process, we also deeply realized the importance of following the mass line. At the beginning of the creation, because we had not fully mobilized the masses, the work was slow, and the creators were anxious. After the timely guidance of the Party organization, a creative team led by the Party branch, composed of choreographers, composers, conductors, stage art designers, etc., was established, and a mass movement was launched to carry out red flag competitions, turning the creative task of "The Small Swords Society" into the task of everyone in the song and dance troupe. In this way, a lively situation immediately appeared. The masses offered suggestions and strategies in the form of wall newspapers and forums, enriching the plot and enriching the content. In the rehearsal process, we explored the five-character formula of composing, rehearsing, watching, discussing, and revising, fully utilizing and concentrating the wisdom of the masses. Practice has proved that this is a working method that adheres to putting politics in command, and following the mass line to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Through this creation of "The Small Swords Society," we are even more convinced that dance dramas can reflect many aspects of the revolutionary struggle, and it also proves the importance of handling the subject matter with the correct viewpoint in creation. If we adhere to the Party's leadership, put politics in command, and follow the mass line in our creations, and break down superstitions, we can overcome any specific difficulties in reflecting modern themes. In our creation this time, in order to find the most appropriate expression methods, we have gone through repeated revisions. Many scenes have gone through almost several treatment plans, constructed and then overturned, rehearsed and then revised, and even after being performed, they are still being revised. For example, in the third scene, in the British consulate, in order to express the anger of the Shanghai people at imperialism and to show the fearless spirit of the Chinese people who were not subjugated by imperialism, we explored a variety of expression techniques, from the first time using recitation to explain, to changing it to Pan Qixiang defeating the foreign soldiers with his double knives to show off his power, until finally determining to handle the masses outside the consulate, holding high torches and demonstrating with righteous indignation. In the exploration process, not only did the choreographers painstakingly research, but all the comrades who participated in the work tried their best to repeatedly propose revision plans. From the complex process experienced in constantly searching for appropriate expression methods in art, we realized that: in the creation of reflecting real struggles, in addition to correctly understanding and handling the subject matter, we must also have hard work, we must have the perseverance to not be afraid of difficulties and to overcome difficulties, and the spirit of not being afraid of failure and boldly innovating and creating. Only in this way can we find the most appropriate artistic expression methods and the most perfect way to show the theme of the work in reflecting real revolutionary struggle themes.

    舞剧《小刀会》的创作经验
    白水
    上海是帝国主义最早侵入的城市之一，百多年来，上海人民为了不愿受帝国主义的迫害和压榨，曾前仆后继地进行了不断的革命斗争。在1853——1855年上海小刀会的起义，是上海人民第一次反对帝国主义和封建统治的武装起义，也是太平天国革命运动重要的一翼。它在当时中外反动派的心脏地区，给了他们一个沉重的打击。这次起义一共坚持了十七个月，最后由于城内粮食断绝而失败，领袖刘丽川也在突围中壮烈牺牲。起义虽然失败了，但小刀会战士们那种英勇不屈、顽强斗争的精神，却在上海人民的革命史上，写下了光辉的一页。选择这个题材，一方面想通过舞剧形式表现出上海人民在帝国主义侵入的初期，就已经出现过像小刀会起义这样的武装斗争，它表现出了我们中华民族不甘心屈服于帝国主义及其走狗的反抗精神。这是值得我们自豪的。另一方面这个斗争历史对目前还有它积极的现实意义，揭露和反对帝国主义侵略，是我们当前重要的斗争任务。
    舞剧艺术是党的文艺战斗武器，它应该反映出时代的斗争和人民的革命理想，应该塑造出伟大的人民革命英雄的形象。
    为了有力地反映这一个历史的革命斗争，我们对有关小刀会起义的各种历史资料，进行了阅读和研究，同时到当时小刀会起义军司令部——豫园附近地带，拜访了许多老年人和文化馆的干部，向他们询问有关小刀会起义的事迹。我们还到小刀会的英雄人物之一周秀英的家乡——青浦县，了解在人民中流传的许多可歌可泣的事迹；这些事迹深深地教育了我们，鼓舞了我们。
    青浦有这样一首歌颂女英雄周秀英的民歌：“青浦有个周秀英，大红裤子小襟身，手拿大刀百把斤，塘湾桥上杀四门。”这首民歌不光是给我们生动地描绘了周秀英的英雄形象，更主要的是使我们看到小刀会的英雄和人民有着多么深切的关系。小刀会的英雄们为人民付出了自己的生命，人民就用歌谣把这些不朽的英雄形象，世世代代地流传下来，教育后一辈人去继承英雄们的那种百折不挠的革命斗争传统。我们越深入了解当时的斗争生活，越占有了丰富的资料，就越鼓舞了我们更努力地去反映这个革命历史的斗争，和歌颂当时英雄们的革命乐观主义的决心。
    在创作工作刚开始的时候，缺乏经验，同时也受到一些西洋舞剧结构方法上的框框的影响，认为舞剧没有爱情的主题，就不能有双人舞、独舞的形式，也就没有舞剧的特色，就会一般化。而且在结构情节中，由于对爱情的描写光是从形式出发，因此有些地方，对人物感情的表现，作了错误的处理。如第六场：上海城被敌人围困了，小刀会的士兵们在坚守危城的艰苦斗争中，而周秀英这位英雄人物却在思念着自己的爱人，得知潘启祥牺牲的消息，竟然当众悲痛地哭倒在地，这就严重地损伤了周秀英这个英雄人物的形象塑造。又如最后一场，为了要使观众看了以后感动，就过分强调它的悲剧气氛，把它结构成为：大雪纷飞，阴霾密布，经过一场决战，小刀会的领袖人物和士兵全部牺牲，最后只剩下周秀英一个人，拿着“顺天行道”的旗帜，孤苦伶仃地前进。结果使整个戏的气氛，低沉、伤感，把观众引入到悲观失望的情绪中去。这些错误的做法，实质上还是资产阶级创作思想影响所造成的。这是一切问题不从内容决定形式出发，而从框框出发，追求形式，所以不可能正确地把小刀会起义的斗争本质和它的时代精神表现出来。当党和领导上发现有这样的偏向时，就及时地指明了这个舞剧应该表现反帝反封建的革命斗争中的人民英雄紧密联系群众，百折不挠的革命斗争意志和乐观主义精神，从而使作品具有现实主义的积极性。根据党的指示，确定了这个题材的正确观点，加强了小刀会起义的时代背景与军民关系，突出小刀会起义的正义性。舞剧的开始是以清兵逼粮，老百姓抗粮为先导，再引起老百姓参加起义军、揭竿而起的斗争场面。加进了小刀会开仓分粮，以及老百姓送粮支援起义军的情节，删去了周秀英的哀伤场面。描写周秀英与士兵共甘苦，同欢乐，在得到潘启祥牺牲消息后，化悲愤为力量，奋起突围。最后加强了小刀会起义军浴血奋战、宁死不屈的坚韧精神，末了加进群众上场对刘丽川的哀悼并送子参军，跟着周秀英高举“顺天行道”大旗，迎着朝阳前进。这样一来，这个剧的结尾虽然是个悲剧，这场斗争虽然暂时失败了，但给人看了是悲壮的。星火不灭，浩气长存，预示着更大规模的轰轰烈烈席卷一切的革命风暴必将到来。
    两个不同的处理方法，是一个极其鲜明的对比，同时也说明了同样的题材，用不同的立场观点和处理方法来表现，就会产生两种绝然不同的结果。这也就使我们进一步认识到必须改造世界观，必须用正确的世界观看待革命历史斗争和正确体现这些斗争的史实。这个问题，真是值得我们很好深思的经验教训。
    反映在舞剧的形式处理上，也存在着两种不同观点。有人在表现方法上，硬搬一些外来的表现手法，以致某些场面生硬地运用了大量的托举动作；也有人认为只有用西洋管弦乐才能完成舞剧音乐的表现任务等。这是一种迷信西洋，轻视民族的观点，是不正确的。当然我们并不反对借鉴外国好的经验，但必须很好地溶化，结合内容进行，如第六场中的弓舞，也运用了托举来表现男兵帮助女兵练习弓箭，显得比较自然而又有民族风格，看起来比较协和。在音乐上也是如此。这次，为了使整个演出更具有民族特色，我们决定用民族乐队来伴奏。上演后观众反映“看和听的都十分亲切”；这就使我们对民族化、群众化的认识又深入了一步。
    在这次创作过程中，我们也深刻地体会到走群众路线的重要性。在创作刚开始时，由于未曾充分发动群众，因此工作速度缓慢，创作者心情焦灼不安，经过党组织及时的指导，建立了党总支领导下的由编导、作曲者、指挥、舞台美术设计等组成的创作组，并且大搞群众运动，开展红旗竞赛，把《小刀会》的创作任务，变为歌舞团每个人的任务。这样一来，立刻出现了一个生气勃勃的局面，群众用墙报、座谈会等形式献计献策，提出了许多好的建议，丰富了剧情，充实了内容。在排练过程中，我们摸索出了编、排、看、议、改的五字诀，充分发挥和集中了群众的智慧。实践证明，这是一个坚持政治挂帅，多快好省的群众路线的工作方法。
    通过这次《小刀会》的创作，使我们更加坚信舞剧是能够反映多方面的革命斗争的，同时也证明了在创作中以正确的观点来处理题材的重要性。如果我们在创作中，坚持党的领导、政治挂帅和群众路线，打破迷信，我们可以克服在反映现代题材上的任何具体困难的。在我们这次创作中，为了寻找最恰当的表现方法，也曾经过三番五次地不断修改，许多场次，差不多都是经过了好几个处理方案，结构了，又推翻，排成了，又修改，甚至已经上演了，还在继续修改中。如第三场在英国领事馆中，为了要表现当时上海人民对帝国主义的愤慨以显示出中国人民不屈于帝国主义的大无畏气概，曾经探索过多种的表现手法，从第一次以朗诵来说明，到改为以潘启祥的双刀击败洋兵逞威来展现，一直到最后确定把群众处理在领事馆外，高举火炬义愤填膺的示威行动为止。在探索过程中，不仅是编导苦心钻研，而且所有参加工作的同志都千方百计、多次提出修改方案。从在艺术上为了不断地寻找恰当的表现方法所经历的复杂过程中，使我们体会到：在反映现实斗争的创作中，除了正确地理解和处理题材之外，还必须有艰苦的劳动，必须有不怕困难、勇于克服困难的毅力和不怕失败、大胆革新创造的精神。只有这样，才能使我们在反映现实革命斗争题材上，找到艺术上最恰当的表现手法，最完美地来展现出作品的主题思想。
