Developing hog raising must steadfastly adhere to the policy of primarily relying on public raising, supplemented by private raising, and advancing public and private raising in conjunction. Countless facts prove that wherever this policy is well implemented, the hog industry develops rapidly and the number of hogs in stock increases quickly; where it is not well implemented, development is slow and increases are small. To further promote the development of the hog industry, all localities must comprehensively implement the policy of public and private raising advancing together, and take effective measures to rapidly develop the hog industry. In the public raising sector, in addition to consolidating and developing hog raising by communes and production teams (basic accounting units), we must also fully tap the hog raising potential of production brigades and canteens, organize brigades and canteens to universally raise hogs, and at the same time actively organize the vast number of commune members to raise hogs.

Large-scale public hog raising by communes and production teams has many advantages. The farms are large and feed a lot, which is convenient for improving technology, increasing labor productivity, and ensuring a larger commodity rate. In the past, hog farms operated by communes and production teams have played a significant role in promoting the development of the entire hog raising industry, and should continue to be vigorously consolidated and developed in the future. These pig farms must be well-managed, which is an important aspect of collective pig raising. In addition, there is a very important force – production brigades and public canteens running pig farms. These pig farms are small in scale, with each unit having only three to twenty heads, which seems "insignificant" compared to large pig farms with more than a thousand heads. However, when these many small units are taken as a whole, they become a very large number. Currently, there are approximately three million production brigades in the country, and each brigade generally has a public canteen. If each production brigade raises an average of twenty pigs, the total number in the country would be more than sixty million. It can be seen that production brigades and public canteens are an indispensable force in developing the hog raising industry.

Production brigades and public canteens, one being the production base and the other being the center of life, possess unique and favorable conditions for raising hogs. Because production brigades are directly engaged in production, and land and labor are completely managed and used by them, it is possible to fully tap labor potential, and use fragmented time and plots of land to collect and plant pig feed. The Huangjiao Management District of Sanhe Commune in Wulong County, Sichuan Province, utilized this condition to plant a total of 300 jin of climbing beans and a large number of gourds, beans, and cowpea in just over a month, and adopted methods of processing agricultural and sideline products to silage and dry store a batch of feed. Leftover soup, melon peels, and vegetable leaves from public canteens are readily available feed. Because pig raising by production brigades and public canteens is "small-scale," other problems such as shed issues and epidemic prevention are also easy to solve. Another major advantage of developing pig raising by production brigades and public canteens is that it can be more closely and directly integrated with agricultural production, because pig feed is collected locally and manure is applied locally. This can greatly save labor in transporting feed and fertilizer, reduce pig raising costs, and free up labor to participate in agricultural production. All of this shows that in the current situation where the advantages of large-scale pig raising are still limited by certain conditions (such as management experience, the solution of feed problems, and the construction of pig houses), we should pay more attention to utilizing the favorable conditions of brigades and canteens, tapping the pig raising potential of brigades and canteens, and raising more and better pigs while vigorously developing pig raising by communes and production teams.

Correctly handling the relationship between large collectives and small collectives is an important key to developing the hog industry and also an important link in consolidating and developing people's communes. At present, the people's communes implement a three-level ownership system based on production teams, and production brigades are the contracting units for agricultural production and should develop pig raising when conditions permit. Of course, if too many pigs are raised, occupying too much labor and feed land, and hindering agricultural production, it should not be done. However, the current situation is not that there are too many pigs raised by brigades, but too few. Most brigades and canteens in a small number of areas have not yet raised pigs, and even in places where pigs are already being raised, the average number per team is only one or twenty, which is still relatively small and should be appropriately developed. Some people oppose developing pig raising by communes and production teams to developing pig raising by production brigades and public canteens, believing that developing pig raising by production brigades and public canteens will affect or even hinder the development of pig raising by communes and will affect or even hinder the growth of the collective economy of the commune. This view is of course not in line with the actual situation. The commune economy is multifaceted, and pig raising is only a small part of it. If brigades raise pigs, and communes and production teams also raise pigs, it will only raise the water level, and will not affect each other. Even if brigades raise a few dozen more pigs, it will not change the economic proportion of large collectives and small collectives. On the contrary, if brigades raise more pigs, accumulate more fertilizer, and produce more grain, cotton, oil, and hemp, it can also promote the prosperity and development of the entire commune economy. Although canteen pig raising is mainly self-sufficient production, the communes, production teams, and brigades can turn all of their pigs into commercial production after the canteens can be self-sufficient and solve the problem of meat consumption for the vast number of farmers, which is beneficial to the country, the communes and production teams, the production brigades, and even every commune member. In order to fully mobilize the pig raising enthusiasm of small collectives, communes and production teams should not only actively establish and run their own pig farms based on the principle of self-breeding and self-raising, but also actively help brigades and canteens raise pigs well.

The Party's policy on developing the hog raising industry is "public raising as the main, private raising as the supplement, and public and private raising advancing together." China is a large agricultural country with 120 million peasant households. Of course, some peasant households do not raise pigs due to religious beliefs or other reasons. Taking a discount and calculating an average of one pig per two households, the total number in the country would be more than 60 million, which is a huge force. Each commune member household has a certain amount of private plots that can be used to plant feed. In addition to participating in collective labor, they also have a certain amount of surplus labor and fragmented time. As long as these conditions are fully utilized and more commune members are mobilized to raise pigs, it is possible to strive for an average of one pig per two households. Moreover, the method of raising pigs is not immutable, and the forms can also be flexible and diverse. Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, utilized the empty old houses in the mountain ravines and marginal areas to rebuild small pig farms. The pigs are owned by the brigade, contracted by the production team, and raised by specialized households. This is a new method that combines public raising and private raising, and has a great effect on developing the hog raising industry. At present, more than 800 such pig farms have been established in Ningxiang County, and more than 900 commune members have been identified as specialized pig raising households, and there are plans to establish a large number more. In short, as long as it is beneficial to developing the hog raising industry, and as long as human and material resources can be fully utilized to raise more pigs, the methods and means can be boldly created, and there is no need to stick to conventions.

Everyone knows the relationship between rapidly developing the hog raising industry and improving people's lives and promoting the rapid development of agricultural production, and correctly and comprehensively implementing the Party's policy of public raising as the main, private raising as the supplement, and public and private raising advancing together, and communes, production teams, production brigades, and public canteens advancing together, can mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties in raising pigs and promote greater development of China's hog raising industry.

### 发展养猪业必须公养为主公私并举

    发展养猪业必须公养为主公私并举
    公养为主、私养为辅、公养私养并举是发展养猪业的坚定不移的方针。无数的事实证明：凡是这一方针贯彻得好的地方，养猪业就发展迅速，存栏猪增加很快；贯彻得不好的地方，则发展缓慢，增加不多。为了进一步推动养猪业的发展，各地必须全面贯彻公养、私养并举的方针，采取有效的措施迅速发展养猪业。在公养部分中，除巩固并发展公社和生产队（基本核算单位）的养猪外，更要充分挖掘生产小队和食堂的养猪潜力，组织小队和食堂普遍养猪，同时也要积极组织广大社员养猪。
    公社和生产队的大群养猪有很多优越性，场子大，喂得多，既便于改进技术、提高劳动生产率，又可以保证较大的商品率。过去，公社和生产队经营的养猪场对整个养猪事业的发展，起了显著的促进作用，今后还应当大力巩固并继续发展。必须把这些猪场办好，这是集体养猪的一个重要的方面，另外，还有一个很重要的力量——生产小队和公共食堂办养猪场。这些养猪场规模较小，每一单位不过三、二十头，同千头以上的大猪场相比，似乎“微不足道”。然而，把这些为数很多的小单位所养的猪作为一个整体看，就成了一个很大的数目。目前，全国大约有三百万个生产小队，每个生产小队大体都有一个公共食堂。如果每个生产小队平均养二十头猪，全国就是六千多万头；由此可见，生产小队和公共食堂实在是发展养猪事业中一支不可忽视的力量。
    生产小队和公共食堂，一个是生产基点，一个是生活中心，它们具备了独有的养猪有利条件。由于生产小队直接搞生产，土地和劳力完全由他们管理使用，这样就有可能充分挖掘劳动潜力，利用零散时间和零星土地，采集和种植猪饲料。四川武隆县三河公社黄角管理区利用这个条件，在一个多月的时间内，共种了三百斤种子的爬山豆和大批瓜豆、牛皮菜等，并采用农副产品加工的办法，青储和干储了一批饲料。公共食堂的残汤剩水、瓜皮菜叶等，更是现成的饲料。因为生产小队和公共食堂养猪“规模小”，其他问题如棚圈问题、防疫问题等等，也容易解决。发展生产小队和公共食堂养猪，还有一个最大的优点，就是可以同农业生产更密切更直接的结合，因为小队养猪饲料就地采集，粪肥就地施用，一可以大大节省运进饲料和运出肥料的劳动力，降低养猪成本，二可以把节省出来的劳动力参加农业生产。所有这些都说明，在目前大群养猪优越性还受到一定条件（如管理经验、饲料问题的解决和猪舍的建筑等）限制的情况下，我们更应当在大力发展公社和生产队的养猪事业的同时，十分重视利用小队和食堂的有利条件，挖掘小队和食堂的养猪潜力，把猪养得更多更好。
    正确处理大集体和小集体的关系，是发展养猪业的重要关键，也是巩固和发展人民公社的一个重要环节。目前人民公社实行的是以生产队为基础的三级所有制，生产小队是农业生产的承包单位，应当在条件许可下发展养猪。当然，如果养猪过多，占用了过多的劳力和饲料地，妨碍了农业生产，是不应该的。但是，当前的情况不是小队养猪多了，而是少了。少数地区大部分小队和食堂还没有养猪，已经养猪的地方，每队平均也只有一、二十头，数量仍然较少，应该适当地发展。有人把发展公社、生产队养猪同发展生产小队和公共食堂养猪对立起来，认为发展生产小队、公共食堂养猪会影响甚至妨碍公社养猪的发展，会影响甚至妨碍公社集体经济的壮大。这种看法当然是不符合实际情况的，公社经济是多方面的，养猪只是其中的一小部分，小队养，公社、生产队也养，只会水涨船高，不会互相影响，即使小队多养了几十头猪，也不会改变大集体和小集体的经济比重，相反，小队多养猪，多积肥，多产粮棉油麻，还可以促进整个公社经济的繁荣和发展。食堂养猪虽然主要是自给性的生产，但食堂能够自给，解决了广大农民的吃肉问题以后，公社、生产队、小队的猪就可以全部成为商品生产，这对于国家、对于公社和生产队、生产小队以至每个社员都是有好处的。为了充分发挥小集体的养猪积极性，公社和生产队除根据自繁自养的原则，积极建立并办好自己的养猪场外，更应当积极地帮助小队和食堂把猪养好。
    党的关于发展养猪事业的方针是“公养为主，私养为辅，公私并举”。我国是一个拥有一亿二千万农户的农业大国，当然，由于宗教信仰或其他原因，有些农户是不养的，打个折扣按平均两户养一头猪计算，全国就是六千多万头，这是一个何等巨大的力量。每户社员都有一定数量的自留地，可以种植饲料，他们除参加集体劳动以外，也还有一定剩余劳力和零散时间，只要充分利用这些条件，动员更多社员养猪，争取两户平均养一头猪是可能做到的。而且养猪方式也不是一成不变的，形式也可以是灵活多样的。湖南宁乡县利用山冲和边缘地区的空旧房屋，改建小型猪场，猪归大队所有，由生产队承包，专业户喂养。这是一种公养和私养相结合的新办法，对发展养猪业有很大作用。目前宁乡全县已建立八百多处这样的养猪场，确定了九百多户社员为养猪专业户，计划还要大量建立。总之，只要对发展养猪业有利，只要能够充分利用人力物力多养猪，方式方法可以大胆创造，不必墨守陈规。
    迅速发展养猪事业，对于改善人民生活和促进农业生产迅速发展的关系，是人人都知道的，而正确地全面地贯彻执行党的公养为主，私养为辅，公养私养并举，公社、生产队、生产小队、公共食堂并举的方针，便能调动起各个方面的养猪积极性，促进我国养猪事业的更大的发展。
