To Be an Actor Worthy of the Mao Zedong Era	Bai Yang
    During the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, I was with comrades gathered from all directions. We talked about many topics, and the most inspiring topic can be summarized in one word: "change." Some comrades said, "Beijing has become so beautiful!" Others said, "Our place has also changed a lot!" In short, everyone was talking about a common theme: the motherland is changing towards the most ideal and beautiful communist future for mankind. People are changing, mountains are changing, water is changing, everything is changing towards the newest and most beautiful future!

    Our films are also changing. The film industry has undergone profound changes since liberation. Most of the films appearing on the screen reflect the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and their struggle for the great cause of socialist construction. Our films show the magnificent scale and immense momentum of the new era, and the faces of people with communist ideals. Many good films praising the Great Leap Forward and recalling the history of the revolution inspire the people's revolutionary enthusiasm and promote the people to advance, and advance further. The films dedicated to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country last year shone with a brand-new brilliance. Since liberation, many new films in our country have been praised by audiences across the country. The number of moviegoers in 1957 reached 2.05 billion, and in 1959 it jumped to 4.15 billion. These booming phenomena make us understand the unparalleled power of the Party's policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the socialist cause even more.

    In this excellent situation where everything is changing, I would like to share some of my experiences as an actor: I remember at the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, one day, on July 6, 1949, at 7:20 pm, our great people's leader Chairman Mao suddenly came to us in person. At that meeting, Chairman Mao spoke to everyone. I remember a few words very clearly. Chairman Mao said, "Because the people need you, we have reason to welcome you." These concise and profound words, after so many years, are still very fresh, and I remember them word for word in my heart. Chairman Mao's words taught us that actors should always think of the people in their hearts, the people!

    Just after liberation, I received a letter from an audience member. The letter was written very plainly, but it began like this: "I envy you, you are an actor of the Mao Zedong era." An actor of the Mao Zedong era! I was suddenly moved by such a title. As an actor of the Mao Zedong era, what a great happiness this is, and how hard-won this happiness is. As someone said: Bridges depend on pillars, houses depend on beams, walking in the dark depends on lights, our happiness all depends on the Communist Party.

    Thinking further, how can we be actors worthy of the Mao Zedong era? Listen to the Party; be a student of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art is our road map, our guiding light, and the only pointer we follow. Once we violate or even slightly deviate from the direction of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, our work will immediately make mistakes. If we leave today, tomorrow, or even before tomorrow, we will find that our work has already made mistakes. There are not few, but too many, examples of this.

    I think of myself and many actor friends before liberation. At that time, we acted with simple patriotic enthusiasm and abstract sense of justice. In the past, actors generally thought that an actor should be able to act out the character's thoughts and feelings, be good at grasping the changes in the character's thoughts and feelings, and "correctly" embody the character. But how to correctly embody the character? What kind of character to play? How to understand the character? What are the standards for beauty, ugliness, good, and evil? Where does love and hatred come from? Who are we performing for? Who are we serving? A series of fundamental questions here, if we say we don't understand them at all, it seems like we understand them a little, but if we say we understand them, we actually don't understand them at all. The so-called "fundamental" is the fundamental difference between the bourgeois worldview and the proletarian worldview is very vague. At the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in 1949, we began to recognize this fundamental problem, thereby breaking the old and establishing the new, and establishing the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    We understand that film art is a weapon of ideological struggle with great power. Film affects people, and the actors in film directly influence people. The influence of film on people can be good or bad, and actors using this weapon of performing art can have different influences, benefiting or harming people. All actors in the world cannot escape such a law, and cannot be separated from the watershed of performing arts formed by different worldviews.

    The term "actor" is the same in all countries. But no matter which actor, if you ask yourself, what is my purpose and meaning in spending my energy on acting in this life? How can he answer? Today, actors of the Mao Zedong era can easily and clearly answer this question. Once an actor can gain this understanding, it is as important as gaining life. Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art is the soul of each of our artistic lives. Without Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art in our creation, there will be no artistic life.

    Our workers say it well:
    "What kind of vine bears what kind of melon, what kind of tree blooms what kind of flower, what kind of era sings what kind of song, what kind of class speaks what kind of words."

    Thinking carefully about these four sentences of the working class is enough for our actors to benefit from for a lifetime. An actor's performance can be compared to bearing melons, blooming flowers, singing songs, and speaking words, but for whom? What kind of melon did your performance bear? What kind of flower did it bloom? What kind of song did it sing? What kind of words did it speak? Every actor can draw a series of thoughts from this in combination with their own creation, which is worth pondering and analyzing.

    Chairman Mao said: "People of petty-bourgeois origin always use various methods, including literary and artistic methods, to stubbornly express themselves, promote their own views, and demand that people transform the Party and transform the world according to the faces of petty-bourgeois intellectuals."

    Today, reviewing Chairman Mao's words does indeed give us a further new understanding. Can we play various different roles with only acting skills? Can we play roles well with only good physical conditions? We say that these are all bourgeois artistic viewpoints, and this approach is not feasible. Either the performance is not good or it is incompatible. The roles in the play are all changing, some have grown, and some have fallen. In the past ten years, each actor has also been developing and changing. Some have undergone a fundamental "change" and "transformation" in their thoughts and feelings, and some have remained unchanged, still inseparable from the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings. Each actor's thoughts and feelings ten years ago must be greatly different from today. Have they changed for the better? Or have they changed for the worse? There is a significant sign in this, as clear as truth, that is, if we follow the direction and path guided by Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art to do and perform, it will change for the better. If we leave Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art to perform, it will be unlikeable and it will be bad. In the ten years since liberation, how many concrete examples have illustrated this point. The vast majority of our actors listen to the Party, go to the fiery struggle of life, go deep into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, gradually change their thoughts and feelings, and improve their ideological awareness through the intense socialist revolution of rectification and the anti-Rightist struggle. Especially in the past two years, actors' creations have seen a Great Leap Forward and a great harvest, creating many brilliant artistic images that have been loved by the masses. Eloquent facts prove that all those who sincerely follow Chairman Mao's direction, go deep into the actual struggle to transform their thoughts and feelings, and seek to blend with the thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers to perform and change, will change for the better and get on the right path—an incomparably correct path pointed out by Chairman Mao.

    Chairman Mao said: "Before the task of educating workers, peasants, and soldiers, there is first a task of learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers." In "The New Year Sacrifice," I played Xiang Lin's Wife. In the process of going to the countryside, I worked with rural women and became their student. I not only absorbed creative nourishment, but also became closer to them in life, and felt that rural women were simple and sincere. Their enthusiasm for putting all their energy into production all day long always touched me. Only then did I realize that even if I had some understanding of them before, it was still relatively abstract. Gradually, I felt the specific qualities of the laboring women's diligence and simplicity, and my own thoughts and feelings changed. I truly loved them and truly wanted to be their student. Similarly, playing Jin Yu Ji, a Korean soldier in the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, and playing Fang Qun, the Party Committee Secretary in "Spring Full of the World," are new topics for me. Shaping the image of the revolutionary leadership force—the communists—is a glorious and arduous task. How much more does our screen need to show more and better images of brilliant communists! How can we meet this glorious and arduous task? At that time, I felt like a first-year student who had just entered school. Despite this, I must not retreat in the face of difficulties, but should advance in the face of difficulties, not be afraid of change, so I had to go to the fiery real struggle to worship teachers. In the process of life, when I was with outstanding Party leaders and advanced worker-peasant-soldier class brothers, I deeply felt that they had a proletarian heart and were infinitely loyal to the Party's cause. In the struggle to invest in building and defending the motherland, their communist style of daring to think and act shone with the light of battle and encouraged me to move forward. In our great era, so many good examples and good teachers have given me the source and strength of creation, and have also given me a little new understanding: Going deep into life is not just to solve the problem of my creative source, but more importantly, to invest in the fiery struggle, transform my thoughts and feelings, transform my worldview, and establish a strong proletarian worldview. Only then is it possible to correctly understand and embody the role you play. As Chairman Mao instructed: "Without this change, without this transformation, nothing can be done well, and everything will be incompatible." Due to the limitations of my ideological awareness and creative level, there are still many shortcomings and great inadequacies in shaping Xiang Lin's Wife, Jin Yu Ji, and Fang Qun. I often think: If life were deeper, and class feelings were more solid, the roles I played would be more profound. As an actor of the Mao Zedong era, I must strive to go deep into life, participate in production labor, strengthen training in the fiery real struggle, strive to study Chairman Mao's works, constantly improve awareness, and thoroughly transform my worldview. Only then is it possible to more deeply understand the creative principle of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, and only then is it possible to create unprecedented, newest and most beautiful proletarian typical characters.

    要做无愧于毛泽东时代的演员	白杨
    在中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会期间，我跟四面八方聚拢来的同志们在一起，大家谈的话题很多，谈得最振奋人心的，概括地说，就是一个“变”字。有的同志说：“北京变得真美！”又有人说：“我们那儿也大大地变了样儿哪！”总之，大家都在说着一个共同的主题：祖国正向着人类最理想、最美丽的共产主义的远景在变。人在变，山在变，水在变，一切都在向着最新最美的远景变！
    我们的电影也是在变。解放后的电影事业发生着深刻的变化。银幕上出现的大多是反映工农兵劳动人民和为社会主义伟大建设而斗争的生活。我们的电影表现出了新时代雄伟的规模，磅礴的气势，表现出了具有共产主义风格的人物面貌。歌颂大跃进，回忆革命史的很多好片子，鼓舞人民奋发的革命热情，推动人民前进，再前进。在去年为建国十周年献礼的影片更是放出了崭新的光辉。解放以来，我国的许多新影片极为全国观众所赞许，电影观众在1957年已经有二十亿五千万人次，1959年一跃而达到四十一亿五千万人次；这些蓬勃发展的现象，使我们更懂得党的电影为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务方针的无比威力。
    在这一切在变的大好形势下，我说一点演员的演变体会：记得在全国第一届文学艺术工作者代表大会上，有一天，那是1949年7月6日下午7时20分，伟大的人民领袖毛主席突然亲临来到了我们中间。在那次会上，毛主席向大家说了话，有几句话我记得非常清楚，毛主席说：“因为人民需要你们，我们就有理由欢迎你们”。这句言简意深的话，经过年深日久，至今还是非常清新，字字句句记在我的心里。毛主席的话教给我们懂得：演员心中时时应想到的是人民，人民！
    刚解放，我接到一封观众给我的信，信里写的很平常，可是开头是这样写的：“我羡慕你，你是毛泽东时代的演员”。毛泽东时代的演员！我突然被这样的称呼所激动，作为毛泽东时代的演员，这是一种多么大的幸福，这种幸福得来多么不易，就像有人说的：桥靠桩，屋靠梁，黑夜走路靠灯光，我们的幸福全靠共产党。
    进一步想一想，怎样去做无愧于毛泽东时代的演员？听党的话；作毛主席的小学生。毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，这是我们的路线图，是我们的指路明灯，也是我们遵循的唯一指针。我们一旦违背甚或稍稍离开毛泽东文艺思想的方向，我们的工作就立刻会犯错误，今天离开，明天，甚或不等明天，就会发现我们的工作已经造成错误，这样的例子，不是少，而是太多了。
    我想起解放前的自己和许多演员朋友，当时凭着单纯的爱国热情，以及抽象的正义感演戏。过去演员一般地以为演员就是要会演角色的思想感情，善于掌握角色的思想感情变化，“正确”地体现角色。但是如何正确地体现角色？演什么角色？怎样去了解角色？美、丑、善、恶根据什么标准？爱憎从何出发？演给谁看？为谁服务？这里面一连串的根本问题，说是完全不懂吧，好像又有点懂，说懂吧，其实根本未懂。所谓“根本”也就是对资产阶级世界观与无产阶级世界观的根本分歧十分模糊。在1949年第一届全国文代大会上，开始认识了这个根本性的问题，从而破旧立新，树立了为工农兵服务的方向。
    我们懂得电影艺术是一种具有强大威力的思想斗争的武器。电影对人发生影响，而电影中的演员，又是直接给予人影响的。电影给人的影响有好影响、坏影响的不同，演员运用这个表演艺术的武器，会起着给人受益或者是受害的不同影响。世界上所有的演员都逃不出这样一个规律，都离不开因世界观的不同而形成的表演艺术的分水岭。
    演员这个名词，在世界各国的称呼上，都是一样的。可是无论哪个演员，如果问一问自己，这一辈子把精力用在演戏上，我的目的和意义是什么？他能怎么回答呢？今天毛泽东时代的演员，是不难明确地回答这个问题的。一个演员一旦能够取得了这个认识，这就像获得生命一样的重要。毛泽东文艺思想是我们每个人的艺术生命的灵魂，在我们的创作中离开了毛泽东文艺思想，一定就没有了艺术生命。
    我们的工人说得好：
    “什么藤结什么瓜，什么树开什么花，什么时代唱什么歌，什么阶级说什么话。”
    细细想想这四句工人阶级的话，真是足够我们演员受用一辈子。一个演员的表演比方得好听一点，就像结瓜、开花、唱歌、说话，可是为谁呀？你的表演结了什么瓜？开了什么花？唱了什么歌？说了什么话？每一个演员结合自己的创作都可以从中引起一连串的想法，值得自己推敲、分析。
    毛主席说过：“小资产阶级出身的人们总是经过种种方法，也经过文学艺术的方法，顽强地表现他们自己，宣传他们自己的主张，要求人们按照小资产阶级知识分子的面貌来改造党，改造世界。”
    今天重温毛主席的话，确实使我们有了进一步的新的领会。我们能不能只凭表演技巧就可以千变万化地扮演各种不同的角色？能不能只凭形体条件好就可以得天独厚地扮演好角色？我们说这都是资产阶级艺术观点，这样做是行不通的，不是演不好就是格格不入。戏中的角色都在变化，有的成长了，有的堕落了。十年来每个演员本身，也是无一不在发展变化，有的思想感情有了一个根本性的“变化”和“改造”，有的万变不离其宗，还离不开那宗资产阶级小资产阶级思想感情。每个演员十年前的思想感情和今天相比，一定会有极大的变化。变好了呢？还是变坏了？这当中有一个显著的标志，像真理一般清澈，这就是如果遵循毛泽东文艺思想指引的方向和道路去做去演就会变好，离开毛泽东文艺思想去演就会不像样，就会坏。解放十年来，有多少具体事例说明了这一点。我们绝大多数的演员，听党的话，到火热的斗争生活中去，深入工农兵生活，逐步改变了自己的思想感情，经过整风反右派斗争的剧烈的社会主义革命，提高了思想觉悟；特别是近两年来，演员的创作出现了大跃进、大丰收的局面，创造出不少光辉的艺术形象，受到广大群众的热爱。雄辩的事实证明，凡是真诚地遵循毛主席指示的方向，深入实际斗争中去改造自己的思想感情，求得和工农兵思想感情打成一片地去演，去变，才会变得好，变得上了路——毛主席指示的一条无比正确的道路。
    毛主席说：“在教育工农兵的任务之前，就先有一个学习工农兵的任务。”我在《祝福》中扮演祥林嫂，在下农村生活的过程中，和农村劳动妇女一起劳动，当她们的小学生，不仅汲取到了创作的养料，而且在生活中和她们的逐渐亲近，更觉得劳动妇女淳厚而诚恳。她们那种终日劳动全副心意都放在生产上的那般劲头，时刻打动着我。我这才认识到我以前即使对她们有所认识，那还是比较抽象的，逐渐我感受到劳动妇女的勤劳、淳厚的具体的品质，自己的思想感情就起着变化，真正爱上了她们，真正愿意当好她们的学生。同样，扮演《金玉姬》这个抗日联军中的朝鲜族战士，和扮演《春满人间》的党委书记方群，对我来说都是新的课题，塑造革命的领导力量——共产党人的形象是个光荣而又艰巨的工作。我们的银幕上又多么需要更多更好地出现光辉的共产党人的形象呵！如何来迎接这个光荣而又艰巨的任务呢？当时我感觉到自己像是刚刚入校门的一年级小学生。尽管这样，我绝不能知难而退，应当知难而进，不怕变，于是只有到火热的现实斗争中去拜老师。在生活的过程中，同优秀的党的领导干部和先进的工农兵阶级弟兄相处时，深深地感到他们具有一颗无产阶级赤子之心，对党的事业无限忠诚。在投入建设祖国和保卫祖国的斗争中，他们那种敢想敢做的共产主义风格，闪耀着战斗的光辉，鼓舞了我前进。在我们伟大的时代中，这么多好榜样、好老师，使我得到创作的源泉和力量，更使我得到一点新的体会：深入生活不只是为了解决自己的创作源泉的问题，更重要的是投入火热的斗争中，改造自己的思想感情，改造自己的世界观，树立坚强的无产阶级世界观。这才有可能正确理解和体现自己所扮演的角色。正如毛主席指示的：“没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”由于我的思想觉悟和创作水平的限制，在塑造祥林嫂、金玉姬和方群这些人物方面，还存在很多缺点和很大不足。我常这样想：假如生活更深厚一些，阶级感情更扎实一些，我演的这些角色就会深刻些。作为毛泽东时代的演员，必须努力深入生活，参加生产劳动，在火热的现实斗争中加强锻炼，努力学习毛主席著作，不断提高觉悟，彻底改造自己的世界观，才有可能更深刻地领会革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的创作原则，才有可能创造出前所未有的最新最美的无产阶级的典型人物。
