Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 14th: The Sino-Korean Friendship Association delegation, accompanied by Choi Ki-chul, Vice-Chairman of the Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations with Korea, visited the Korean War Liberation Museum today.

The head of the delegation, Li Dequan, President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association and Minister of Public Health of China, and the deputy head of the delegation, Li Jiebo, Council Member of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, Alternate Member of the CPC Central Committee, and Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, as well as the delegation members, carefully viewed various objects and exhibits in the museum that record the heroic achievements of the armies of the Chinese and Korean peoples in defeating the aggression of the world's number one imperialism—U.S. imperialism.

The delegation viewed the model of the battle to liberate Daejeon by the Korean People's Army. In this battle, the heroic Korean People's Army annihilated the U.S. 24th Division and captured its commander, Dean, alive. The delegation also visited the exhibits about the fighting and lives of the Korean People's Army on the 1211 Heights (which the U.S. military, frightened by the People's Army, called "Heartbreak Ridge") and the sand table model of the Battle of Shangganling by the Chinese People's Volunteers. The delegation deeply admired the great achievements of the Korean people and the Korean People's Army in the struggle against imperialist aggression and in defending the freedom and independence of their motherland.

After the visit, delegation head Li Dequan wrote in the memorial book: "Heroic people, heroic deeds, heroic epic."

On the 13th, the delegation, accompanied by Choi Ki-chul, visited the cityscape of Pyongyang, the heroic city rebuilt after the war.
