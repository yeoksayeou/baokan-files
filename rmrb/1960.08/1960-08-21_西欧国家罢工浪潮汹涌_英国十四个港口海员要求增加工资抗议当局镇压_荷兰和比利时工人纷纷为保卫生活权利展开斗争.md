(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: British seamen in fourteen ports have been on strike since the 10th, demanding wage increases and shorter working hours. Despite court orders for strike leaders to stop the strike and the arrest of seamen, British seamen insist that their just demands must be met. The strike has paralyzed some ports. It is reported that on the 15th, eighty-five ships could not sail from London ports, and on the 16th, eighty-nine ships could not sail from Liverpool ports.

Approximately two thousand seamen in South Shields held a strike march on the 15th. All the seamen marched, holding banners demanding a forty-four-hour work week and a monthly wage increase of four pounds. At a rally after the march, a vote of no confidence was passed against Thomas Yates, the general secretary of the National Union of Seamen, demanding his immediate resignation. Newspapers reported that seamen in various ports strongly opposed the compromise agreement reached between the leaders of the National Union of Seamen and the National Maritime Board.

In Hull, seamen gathered to firmly support the striking seamen who were arrested and sentenced to one month in prison for striking, and raised funds to support their appeal.

London dockworkers held a meeting on the 15th and decided to call on 30,000 London dockworkers to strike this Wednesday, demanding a weekly wage increase of 25 shillings, and to support the seamen's strike.

In Liverpool, more than 7,000 seamen and dockworkers held a demonstration on the 16th. Ship repair workers, construction technicians, electricians, and painters also participated in the march. This march was the largest and most militant demonstration of working-class power in Liverpool in many years. Seamen in Glasgow, Southampton, South Shields, Belfast, and other British ports also held marches.

Three thousand workers at a machine manufacturing factory in Utrecht Province, Netherlands, went on strike on the 15th, demanding a wage increase.

Prior to this, 6,000 dockworkers in Amsterdam also went on strike demanding wage increases. According to the Catholic trade union newspaper "The People's Paper," the strike brought activities at Amsterdam's port to a near standstill.

Although the dockworkers have now returned to work, they have stated that if their wage demands are not met before September 1, they will strike again.

The dockworkers are extremely dissatisfied with the right-wing leadership group of the union for not representing their interests. They announced that if the union does not change its attitude and there is another strike on September 1, they will form a new dockworkers' union.

The Belgian government is intensifying its attack on the people's living standards, and strike struggles by workers in various places to defend their vital rights are erupting one after another. Newspapers in Brussels recently published details of the Catholic Democratic-Liberal Party government's economic "consolidation and savings" plan. According to this plan, the tax burden on the Belgian people will increase by 9 billion Belgian francs; while the budgets for public construction and health will be reduced by 25 billion francs and 800 million francs respectively.

The Belgian working class is fighting back against the exploitation of the ruling group with intensified struggles. It is reported that at the "Gilson Metal Factory" in the central region of Belgium, approximately 1,200 workers went on strike this morning, demanding higher wages.

Several hundred workers in Belgian stone mines, who went on strike two months ago to improve their living conditions, are still persisting in their struggle. According to the union, they will hold a new demonstration and rally on the 12th.

Approximately 1,500 workers at the "Abede Metal Factory" in the Ghent area of northern Belgium have ended their ten-week strike victoriously. Faced with their strong unity, the capitalists finally had to accept their wage demands. Workers at the "TMT Metal Factory" in the same area are continuing their strike, which began four weeks ago, protesting against increasing unemployment and demanding guarantees for workers' lives.

    西欧国家罢工浪潮汹涌
    英国十四个港口海员要求增加工资抗议当局镇压
    荷兰和比利时工人纷纷为保卫生活权利展开斗争
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：英国十四个港口的海员自10日起开始罢工，要求增加工资和缩短工作时间。尽管法院下令罢工领袖停止罢工和海员遭到逮捕，英国海员坚持必须满足他们的正义要求。这次罢工使一些港口陷于瘫痪。据报道，伦敦各港口15日有八十五艘船不能启航，利物浦港口16日有八十九条船不能启航。
    南喜尔兹的大约二千名海员15日举行罢工游行。全体海员举着要求每周工作四十四小时和每月增加工资四英镑的旗帜前进。在游行后举行的集会上，通过了对全国海员工会总书记托马斯·耶茨的不信任投票，要求他立即辞职。据报纸报道，各港口的海员强烈反对全国海员工会领导人同全国海运局达成的妥协的协定。
    在赫尔，海员集会坚决支持因罢工而被捕和判处一个月徒刑的罢工海员，并筹款支援他们上诉。
    伦敦码头工人15日集会，作出决定，号召伦敦的三万码头工人在本星期三举行罢工，要求每周增加工资二十五先令，并声援海员的罢工。
    在利物浦，七千多名海员和码头工人16日举行示威游行。船舶修理工人、建筑技工、电气工人和油漆工人也参加了游行队伍。这次游行是利物浦很多年以来规模最大和最有战斗性的工人阶级力量的示威。格拉斯哥、南安普敦、南喜尔兹、培尔法斯特和英国其他港口的海员，也举行游行。
    荷兰乌得勒支省一个机器制造工厂的三千名工人15日罢工，要求增加工资。
    在此以前，阿姆斯特丹六千码头工人也罢工要求增加工资，据天主教工会报纸“人民报”报道，这次罢工使阿姆斯特丹港口的活动几乎完全停顿。
    码头工人现在虽然已经复工，但是他们表示，如果在9月1日以前他们的工资要求得不到满足，他们就要重新罢工。
    码头工人对工会右翼领导集团不能代表他们的利益极为不满，他们宣布，如果工会再不改变态度，9月1日再罢工时要另组码头工人工会。
    比利时政府加紧向人民生活水平进攻，各地工人为保卫切身权利而进行的罢工斗争此伏彼起。布鲁塞尔的报纸最近公布了天主教民主党—自由党政府的经济“整肃和节约”计划的详细内容。根据这项计划，比利时人民的赋税负担将增加九十亿比利时法郎；而公共建设和卫生的预算却要分别削减二百五十亿法郎和八亿法郎。
    比利时工人阶级以加强斗争来反击统治集团的压榨。据报道，在比利时中部地区的“吉耳逊金属工厂”，有大约一千二百名工人今天上午举行罢工，要求提高工资。
    早在两个月以前就为改善生活条件而举行罢工的比利时石矿的几百名工人，仍然在坚持斗争。据工会宣布，他们将在12日举行新的示威和集会。
    比利时北部根特地区“阿贝德金属工厂”的大约一千五百名工人坚持了十周的罢工已经在不久前胜利结束。在他们的坚强团结面前，资方终于不得不接受了他们关于工资的要求。同在这个地区的“TMT金属工厂”的工人则继续坚持他们在四周前开始的罢工，抗议越来越多的失业，并且要求保障工人们的生活。
