Taking Large Industry as the Main Body, Organizing Ten Joint Enterprises in Shenyang Hongqi Commune According to the Principle of Similar Production Nature

    (Our Dispatch) The Hongqi People's Commune in Dadong District, Shenyang City, has organized all the state-owned, locally state-owned, and commune-run industries within the commune into ten joint enterprises with large industries as the main body, based on the principle of similar production nature. This has created a new atmosphere of production collaboration between large industries, and between commune-run industries and large industries.

    The Hongqi People's Commune is composed mainly of several state-owned and locally state-owned industries. In the past, some cooperative relationships such as processing, ordering, and raw material supply have been established between commune-run industries and large industries. However, due to the lack of a unified institution to plan and arrange them, these cooperative relationships were mostly temporary and sporadic, unable to meet the needs of the production development of large industries and commune-run industries. In order to further promote the development of production, the Party Committee of Hongqi People's Commune organized all the state-owned, locally state-owned, and commune-run industries into ten joint enterprises such as machinery, hardware, chemical industry, and textile industry according to their production nature. These enterprises ensure the completion of the production of state-owned and locally state-owned factories, and uniformly arrange the processing and ordering relations between large industries, and between large industries and commune-run industries. They also uniformly use some raw materials, materials, and equipment.

    Although the Hongqi People's Commune has not established joint enterprises for a long time, it has shown superiority in many aspects. Each joint enterprise arranges the production of commune-run industries according to the production plan of large industries. At present, among the 360 kinds of products produced by commune-run industries, 208 kinds have been determined by the joint enterprises to serve large industries; 250 kinds of products of commune-run industries are produced by large industries that fixedly supply edge and leftover materials, which makes commune-run industries more integrated into the national plan, and changes the phenomenon that some commune-run industries competed with large industries for raw materials in the past. In the past, state-owned and locally state-owned industries of this commune needed to process parts for 35 kinds of products in Fushun, Liaoyang and other places. Now, through the unified arrangement of the joint enterprises, all these products have been solved within the commune. The state-owned machinery factory of the hardware joint enterprise of this commune can produce chains and sprockets for electric vehicles, the commune-run factory No. 2 can produce car bodies, the commune-run factory No. 9 can produce DC generators, and the commune-run hardware factory can produce various parts. The hardware joint enterprise organized these factories to jointly produce electric vehicles suitable for short-distance transportation in the city.

    Since the joint enterprises, under the unified leadership of the Commune Party Committee, have transformed the temporary cooperative relationship between factories into a unified plan and unified arrangement within the enterprise, some large industries can systematically release a part of their products to commune-run industries, freeing themselves up to produce more advanced products. According to the statistics of thirteen state-owned and locally state-owned factories, in the first half of the year, 146 kinds of products such as small lamps, hemp ropes, ointments, and stationery were released to commune-run industries. In order to enable commune-run industries to quickly put these products into production, state-owned and locally state-owned industries provided comprehensive support to commune-run industries.

    After the establishment of joint enterprises, commune-run industries have improved their equipment, improved their production technology, and had a fixed source of raw materials with the help of large industries. The original specialized production, especially the production of small commodities, has also greatly developed. The production of small commodities in the entire commune increased by 97 types after the establishment of joint enterprises, including shoe polish, children's cars, hair clips, etc., which are popular in the market.

    Due to the unified leadership of the Commune Party Committee, the joint enterprises organized large-scale production collaboration, and the production of large industries and commune-run industries has shown a new face. All 27 state-owned and locally state-owned factories in the commune completed half of the annual national plan ahead of schedule in the first half of the year, and production in July and August has further developed; commune-run industries have also been rapidly developed and further consolidated. The total actual output value completed in the first half of the year was 77.7% more than the total for the whole year of last year, and the variety of products rapidly increased from 213 at the beginning of the year to 360.

    以大工业为主体　按生产性质相同相近原则
    沈阳红旗公社组织十个联合企业
    本报讯　沈阳市大东区红旗人民公社，将全社范围内的国营、地方国营工业和社办工业，按生产性质相同、相近的原则，组成十个以大工业为主体的联合企业，使大工业与大工业之间、社办工业与大工业之间的生产协作出现了新的气象。
    红旗人民公社是以若干国营和地方国营工业为主体组成的。过去，在社办工业与大工业之间，已经建立了一些加工、订货和原料材料供应等协作关系。但是，由于缺乏一个统一的机构来有计划地加以安排，这些协作关系大都是临时性的、时断时续的，不能适应大工业和社办工业生产发展的需要。红旗人民公社党委为了更加促进生产的发展，就把全社的国营、地方国营和社办工业，按它们的生产性质组成机械、五金、化工、纺织等十个联合企业，在保证完成国营、地方国营工厂生产，统一安排大工业之间、大工业和社办工业之间的加工订货关系，并且统一使用部分原料、材料和设备。
    红旗人民公社举办联合企业虽然时间不长，但已在许多方面显示出了优越性。各联合企业都根据大工业的生产计划来安排社办工业的生产，目前社办工业生产的三百六十种产品中，就有二百零八种经联合企业确定是固定为大工业服务的；有二百五十种社办工业的产品，由大工业固定地供给边材余料进行生产，这就使社办工业在更大程度上纳入了国家计划，并且改变了过去某些社办工业和大工业争原料的现象。这个公社的国营、地方国营工业，过去有三十五种产品的部件需要到抚顺、辽阳等地加工，现在这些产品通过联合企业的统一安排，全部在公社范围内得到了解决。这个公社五金联合企业的国营机械厂能生产电瓶车用的链子、牙轮，社办二厂能生产车体，社办九厂能生产直流发电机，社办小五金厂能生产各种零件。五金联合企业就把这几家工厂组织起来，联合生产出了适用于市内短途运输的电瓶车。
    由于联合企业在公社党委的统一领导下，把各厂之间临时性的协作关系变为企业内部的统一计划、统一安排，这就使一些大工业可以有计划地下放一部分产品给社办工业，自己腾出手来生产更高级的产品。据十三个国营、地方国营工厂统计，上半年就将小型灯具、麻绳、药膏、文具用品等一百四十六种产品下放给社办工业。为了使社办工业能迅速将这些产品投入生产，国营、地方国营工业对社办工业进行了全面支援。
    联合企业建立以后，社办工业由于在大工业的帮助下改善了设备，提高了生产技术，有了固定的原料来源，原有的专业生产，特别是小商品生产，也有了很大发展。全公社的小商品生产在建立联合企业后增加了九十七种，其中有市场畅销的鞋油、儿童车、头发夹等。
    由于公社党委的统一领导，联合企业大规模地组织了生产协作，大工业和社办工业的生产都出现了新的面貌。全社二十七个国营、地方国营工厂在上半年都提前完成了全年国家计划的一半，7月和8月份的生产又有了进一步的发展；社办工业也得到迅速发展和进一步巩固，上半年实际完成的总产值比去年全年还多77.7％，产品品种由年初二百一十三种，迅速增加到三百六十种。
