　　"Old Steward"
　　Early in the morning, Chengang Village, Youjitun Commune, Suixian County, Henan, was still immersed in the tranquility before dawn. The 62-year-old storekeeper, Ren Xingshi, had already finished checking the pigsty and sheepfold. He picked up a handful of wild vegetables someone had thrown outside the canteen, muttering to himself, "This is public property!"
　　Ren Xingshi joined the Red Army at the age of thirty-one. After liberation, he participated in the construction of the new countryside. In the spring of 1955, when Chengang established a high-level cooperative, he was selected to be the storekeeper. At that time, he was so excited that he couldn't sleep all night, muttering to himself, "Old Ren, everything in the cooperative has been entrusted to you. Under no circumstances can public property be allowed to suffer losses." He wrote in his diary and on his bedside: "The cooperative's property is a treasure; my own things don't matter."
　　Ren Xingshi is a storekeeper who loves public property. In order to improve his business, he studied diligently and created the "cash rapid receipt and payment method" and the "grain storage file book." For six years, the tools, finances, and funds under his care have been clear and accurate. The masses affectionately call him "Old Steward."

    “老管家”
    清晨，河南睢县尤吉屯公社陈岗村还沉浸在黎明前的宁静中，六十二岁的老保管任兴诗已经查完猪圈和羊圈。食堂外不知谁扔了一把野菜，他一面拾起，一面自语：“这是公共财产呐！”
    任兴诗三十一岁参加了红军，解放后，参加了新农村的建设事业。一九五五年春，陈岗成立高级社时，选他担任了保管员，当时他兴奋的一夜睡不着觉，心里嘀咕着：“老任呐，社里一切财产交给你了，无论如何不能叫公共财产受损失。”他在自己的日记本上和床头上写着：“社里财产是宝贝，自己东西无所谓。”
    任兴诗是个热爱公共财产的保管员。为了搞好业务，他钻研苦干，创造出“现金快速出纳法”“粮食保管档案簿”等。六年来，经他保管的工具、财务和资金，都是清清楚楚。群众都亲切地叫他“老管家”。
