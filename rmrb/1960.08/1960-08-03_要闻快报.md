News in Brief

State-owned Farms Reclaim More Than 10 Million Mu of Wasteland

State-owned farms across the country are actively reclaiming wasteland and expanding cultivated land area. Currently, the northern reclamation areas are vigorously opening up wasteland during the slack season, while the southern provinces are intensifying the management of newly sown crops and further expanding the cultivated land area.

According to statistics from the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, the national state farm system has newly reclaimed more than 18 million mu of wasteland in the first half of this year. Among them, over 8.3 million mu of newly reclaimed land in Hebei, Gansu, Qinghai, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces (autonomous regions), as well as the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, Mudanjiang, Hejiang, and Hulunbuir League, which are directly under the system, have already been sown.

Qinghai Agricultural Region Focuses on Livestock Fattening

People's communes in the agricultural region of Qinghai Province are taking various measures to strengthen the feeding and management of draught animals, taking advantage of the current lush grass and relatively low usage of draught animals, to ensure livestock fattening in preparation for the upcoming autumn harvest and autumn plowing.

While organizing draught animals to graze on mountains to gain weight, various localities have also strengthened the feeding and management of draught animals remaining in the communes for work. The Shancheng Production Team of Hanzhuang Commune in Ledu County specifically organized 27 semi-able-bodied laborers to cut grass along the fields, preparing sufficient night grass for the draught animals. Currently, all livestock in the team, whether grazing on the mountains or remaining in the team for work, have reached the first or second grade of fatness.

Tibet's Pastoral Areas Plan Pastures

Herdsmen in the vast pastoral areas of Shannan, Northern Tibet, and Ali in Tibet have begun preliminary planning of pastures, implementing rational grazing, reclaiming wasteland, and gradually cultivating and expanding grasslands.

Recently, herdsmen in Luozha and Lajiari counties of the Shannan area have implemented a system of rotational grazing in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Herdsmen from the Mendui, Chiba, and Riwa tribes in the Nagqu area of Northern Tibet have conducted comprehensive planning of pastures based on the seasonal grazing habits of "grazing sunny slopes in winter and cool slopes in summer." In July, more than 200 large tribes of herdsmen in Northern Tibet drove their cattle and sheep up the mountains according to this year's new plan to graze and fatten them, leaving many plains, river valleys, and low-lying grasslands as winter and spring grazing pastures.

Inner Mongolia Vigorously Develops Hydropower Stations

People's communes in rural areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are vigorously developing various small-scale power stations and hydroelectric stations to serve agricultural production.

According to incomplete statistics from the region in early July, 150 new hydroelectric stations have been built this year, and 83 power stations utilizing water, fire, wind, biogas, and other sources to generate electricity have been established. In addition, 131 hydroelectric stations and 50 hydroelectric stations are currently under construction.

The establishment of these power stations in rural Inner Mongolia is based on the principles of self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and vigorously launching mass movements.

Guanxian Widely Utilizes Hydropower

Guanxian County in Sichuan Province widely utilizes hydropower to serve production and life. The county has now built more than 2,000 hydropower stations, generating a total of more than 11,000 horsepower of power daily, which is used for more than 500 types of work, including blowing, sawing wood, crushing stones, lifting water, threshing, oil extraction, vegetable cutting, and sewing, replacing the labor of more than 110,000 people.

    各地在组织耕畜上山抓膘的同时，对留在社里使役的耕畜也加强了饲养管理。乐都县汉庄公社山城生产队专门组织了二十七名半劳力到田边、地头割草，为耕畜准备足够的夜草。目前全队不论上山的和留在队里使役的牲畜都达到了一二类膘。
