Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Electric Dispatch: Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, mines are adjusting labor organization, drawing large numbers of laborers to work underground, strengthening underground mining and excavation, and increasing the production of raw coal and ore to supply steel factories.

Currently, the number of laborers in the city's mines participating in and going down to the production area has increased from 65.5% of the total number of employees to 74.1%, of which the proportion of mining and excavation workers has increased from 19.1% to 33.7%. Due to the increase in underground labor and improved production efficiency, the output of raw coal in July increased by 9.75% compared with June, and ore increased by 20.9%. Since August, the average daily output of raw coal and ore has increased by 16% and 6.7% respectively compared with July. This not only meets the needs of iron smelting for raw materials and fuel but has also accumulated more than 23,000 tons of raw coal and ore sufficient for fifteen days of use.

Since entering the third quarter, the steel production capacity of Xiangtan City has rapidly increased, and the demand for raw coal and ore has greatly increased. In order to increase the production of raw coal and ore, the Xiangtan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all mines to adjust labor organization, fully tap the potential of human resources within enterprises, and strengthen underground operations. According to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, the Party committees of each mine conducted ideological education among cadres and employees, conducted a thorough investigation of the labor force of the entire mine, formulated a plan for adjusting labor organization, and submitted it to the masses for discussion. Then, according to the plan, the labor organization was adjusted, and a group of non-production personnel were transferred to work underground; the auxiliary workers, handyman workers, electromechanical workers, and transport workers on the ground were also appropriately reduced, and some people were drawn to work underground.

    调整劳动组织  压缩非生产人员
    湘潭各矿山采掘队伍迅速扩大
    据新华社长沙电  湖南省湘潭市各矿山调整劳动组织，抽调大批劳动力下井，加强井下采掘，增产原煤、矿石供给钢铁工厂。
    目前，全市矿山参加并下生产的劳动力，已由原来占职工总人数的65.5％增加到74.1％，其中采掘工人的比例由19.1％增加到33.7％。由于井下劳动力增加，生产效率提高，7月份的原煤产量比6月份增长9.75％，矿石增长20.9％；8月以来的原煤、矿石平均日产量又分别比7月份增长16％和6.7％，不仅满足了炼铁离炉对原料、燃料的需要，而且积存了二万三千多吨原煤和可供十五天用的矿石。
    进入第三季度以来，湘潭市钢铁生产能力迅速提离，对原煤、矿石的需要量大大增加。为了增产原煤和矿石，中共湘潭市委指示各矿调整劳动组织，充分挖掘企业内部的人力潜力，加强井下作业。各矿党委根据市委的指示，向干部和职工进行了思想教育，对全矿劳动力情况进行了摸底算账，拟定了调整劳动组织的计划，交给群众讨论。然后根据计划，调整了劳动组织，抽调了一批非生产人员下井跟班劳动；对地面的辅助工、勤杂工、机电工、运输工也适当压缩，抽出一部分人到井下劳动。
