    Harbin, 16th (Our Dispatch) - The Changwu People's Commune in Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, began vigorously promoting year-round field manure accumulation last year, and it has now become a regular system, yielding significant results. The quantity of fertilizer has greatly increased, and the quality has greatly improved, while the labor and animal power expended have been greatly reduced.
    Since the beginning of this year, the commune has continued to adhere to the field manure accumulation system. Each district and team has dedicated personnel, horses, and vehicles for year-round manure accumulation. On average, every 150 mu of land has a manure pit that is five meters wide and thirty meters long. The quantity of green manure accumulated is considerable, and the quality is also very good. According to statistics at the beginning of August, the total amount of fertilizer accumulated in the fields and within the village by the entire commune is more than 560 million jin, accounting for more than 30% of the fertilizer application amount for next year. Currently, the commune is also taking advantage of the favorable time of the hot season to vigorously promote field manure accumulation.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, Changwu Commune has launched a mass movement for accumulating and producing fertilizer, and the amount of fertilizer applied has increased year by year. However, the amount of labor used was very large. The labor and animal power occupied by the accumulation, production, and delivery of fertilizer throughout the year accounted for 30%-40% of the field labor, making labor and animal power extremely strained. Due to the large amount of labor used, it was difficult to carry out during the busy farming season, so they had to concentrate on accumulating and producing fertilizer in the summer and winter, and rush to deliver fertilizer before spring planting, which seriously affected the further increase in the quantity of manure and the further improvement in quality. Even so, it often happened that either fertilization squeezed out other production tasks, or other production squeezed out fertilization. For example, sometimes the sowing period was delayed due to fertilizer delivery, and sometimes the phenomenon of little or no fertilization in remote areas occurred in order to sow on time, affecting overall production increase.
    In order to meet the requirements of achieving a sustained and comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production, they actively studied measures to increase the amount of fertilizer applied, improve the quality of manure, and reduce the amount of labor used, based on instructions from higher authorities. They analyzed that the main reason for the excessive amount of labor used in fertilizer work was that general fertilizer was mixed with more than 60% soil. So much soil had to be pulled back from the fields and then pulled back to the fields, consuming most of the manpower and horsepower here. In order to solve the problem of pulling the soil in and out, they adopted field manure accumulation measures and established manure accumulation points in the fields. That is, a piece of land is designated at the edge of the field as a long-term fixed manure accumulation base. Pure manure is sent to the field manure accumulation points, and then mixed with soil, grass, and water for composting. There are two composting methods: one is piling, that is, piling a layer of weeds, a layer of manure, and a layer of soil, watering each layer to keep it moist, and sealing the surroundings with mud, piling it higher and higher. In winter, in order to keep warm and ferment, sorghum stalks are used to make screens to surround the manure piles, and corn leaves or "Ge Rao" are filled between the manure pile and the screen, and yellow manure is covered on the top of the pile. This method requires large manure piles; small ones won't work. The other is pit composting, that is, digging a large pit, which should not be too small or too shallow, and laying a layer of soil, a layer of manure, and a layer of "Ge Rao" or weeds in the pit, and constantly watering it. After filling the pit flat, the pit mouth is sealed with soil. It can be composted in about seven days in summer and ten days to half a month in spring and autumn. After composting, it is taken out and piled up for continued composting, which can be carried out all year round, with both quantity and quality.
    Due to the adoption of this method, the commune accumulated more than 870 million jin of manure in the fields in 1959 alone. Together with the manure accumulated in the village, the total amount reached 1,100.993 million jin, an increase of 48% over the total amount of manure accumulated in 1958. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu increased by more than 3,800 jin, and the quality of manure was greatly improved. The entire commune completely eliminated the use of raw manure in the fields. At the same time, a large amount of manpower and animal power was saved. Not only was there no need to transport soil back and forth, but also the pure manure was mostly brought to the field manure accumulation points by commune members when they went to the fields. When fertilizing, the manure was right at the edge of the field, saving long-distance transportation. The entire commune has 480 vehicles. If all the manure was accumulated in the village in 1959, it would take 110 days for all the vehicles to deliver it completely. In fact, it was completed in just 28 days this spring, and there was no sense of tension. Compared with previous years, the total amount of manure accumulation, production, and delivery can save about 60% of labor and animal power. It also ensures that every plot of land has manure, eliminating plots with little or no fertilization. Because field manure accumulation is done on the spot, it is possible to fertilize according to local conditions. Because field manure accumulation is carried out all year round, fertilization and top dressing can be done at any time. Fertilization can be done in autumn, and plowing in summer, autumn, and spring can be done after fertilization. At the same time, constantly transporting manure and compost from the village to the fields can greatly promote the improvement of environmental hygiene.

    昌五公社坚持田间积肥施肥量逐年增加
    一九五九年积肥制肥送肥比往年约节省劳、畜力百分之六十
    消灭了少施或不施肥的地块，做到了因地施肥，先施肥后翻地
    本报哈尔滨16日电　黑龙江省肇东县昌五人民公社从去年开始大搞常年田间积肥，现已成为经常的制度，收到了巨大效果。肥料的数量大大增加，质量大大提高，但是所花费的劳动力和畜力则大大减少。
    今年以来，这个公社仍继续坚持田间积肥制度，各区、队都有专人、专马、专车常年搞积肥，平均每一百五十亩地就有一个五米宽、三十米长的粪坑，所积造的绿肥数量不少，质量也很好。到8月初统计，全公社在田间积的肥和在村内积的肥，共有五亿六千多万斤，约占明年施肥量的30％多。目前，这个公社还正利用伏天的有利时机，大搞田间积肥。
    昌五公社从大跃进以来，开展了群众性的积肥造肥运动，施肥量逐年增加。但是，用工量很大，全年积肥、造肥、送肥所占用的人工、马工，占田间用工量30％—40％，使劳力、畜力极其紧张。由于用工量很大，农忙时就难于进行，只好在夏季和冬季突击积肥、造肥，在春播前突击送肥，严重影响了粪肥数量的进一步增加，质量的进一步提高。即使如此，还往往发生不是施肥挤了其他各项生产，就是其他生产挤了施肥的情况。例如有时因送肥推迟了播种期，有时因要按期播种又出现远地施肥少或不施肥的现象，影响全面增产。
    为了适应实现农业生产持续的全面的跃进的要求，他们根据上级指示，积极研究既能增加施肥数量、提高粪肥质量，又能减少用工量的措施。他们分析了粪肥工作用工量过大的主要原因是：一般肥料中掺土60％以上，这样多的土既要从田间拉回来，又要拉到田间去，人力、马力大部分消耗在这里了。为了解决把土拉进拉出的问题，他们采取了田间积肥的措施，在田间建立积肥网点。就是在地头地边划出一片地，作为长期的固定的积肥基地，把纯粪送到田间积肥点去，再掺土、掺草、掺水进行沤制。沤制方法有两种，一种是堆沤，即是堆积一层杂草、一层粪便、一层土，层层浇水，保持湿润，四周用泥封闭，越堆越高。冬季为了保温醱酵，用秫秸夹障子，把粪堆围上，在粪堆与障子中间填塞苞米叶子或“格荛”，堆顶盖上黄粪。这种办法，粪堆要大，小了不行。另一种是坑沤，即是挖一个大坑，坑不能太小太浅，在坑中铺一层土、一层粪、一层“格荛”或杂草，并不断灌水，把坑装平后坑口用土封闭。夏季七天左右即可沤好，春秋十天到半月也可沤好。沤好后起出堆起来，继续再沤，可以常年进行，数量既多，质量又好。
    这个公社由于采取了这种办法，1959年仅田间积肥即达八亿七千多万斤，加上村内积肥，共达十一亿零九百九十三斤，比1958年总积肥量增加48％，每亩施肥量增加了三千八百余斤，并且大大提高了粪肥质量，全公社彻底消灭了生粪下地。同时节省了大量的人力、畜力，不仅不再往返运土，就是把纯粪运到田间积肥点，也大部是社员下地时顺便带去的：施肥时，粪肥就在地头，也省去了长途运输。全公社共有车辆四百八十辆，1959年如果全部是村内积肥，车辆全部出动共需一百一十天才能送完。实际上今春仅仅二十八天就送完了，还没有感到紧张。和往年比起来，积肥、制肥、送肥总算在一起，约可节省劳力、畜力60％左右。并且做到了块块地有粪肥，消灭了少施肥和不施肥的地块。由于田间积肥是就地积肥，从而做到了因地施肥。由于田间积肥是常年进行的，可以随时施肥，随时追肥，可以秋施肥，伏、秋、春翻地都可以先施肥后翻地。同时把村内粪便和堆肥经常不断的运到田间去，可以大大促进环境卫生的改善。
