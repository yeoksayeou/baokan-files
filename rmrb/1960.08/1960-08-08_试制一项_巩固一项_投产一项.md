    Trial-produce One, Consolidate One, Put One into Production
    To measure how well a factory has completed the task of increasing product variety, one cannot simply look at how many new products have been trial-produced, but more importantly, how many new products have actually been successfully trial-produced and put into batch production. Therefore, we must promote the practice of trial-producing one, consolidating one, and putting one into production.
    A crucial key to achieving trial-producing one, consolidating one, and putting one into production is that the enterprise leaders must develop a down-to-earth work style. This is because there are many specific problems that need to be solved from trial-producing new products to mass-producing new products. For example, in the product trial production stage, because the output is small, the required equipment capacity is not much. After batch production, the problem of insufficient equipment capacity becomes prominent. If these specific problems are not practically solved, it will be difficult to produce new products in batches. Secondly, during the trial production stage, some problems can be solved by relying on the strength of the masses in one workshop or one group, but when batch production is put into operation, some problems cannot be solved by one workshop or one group, and the strength of the masses in the entire factory must be mobilized to solve them. Because only when the strength of the broad masses is organized can the equipment capacity and manpower potential within the enterprise be fully utilized and tapped. The Shanghai Kepei Instrument Factory, after criticizing the incorrect ideas of some cadres, closely relied on the strength of the masses in the entire factory, so that many problems that were originally considered unsolvable were readily solved, and new products were able to be put into batch production in a short period of time, which is a very good example.
    From this, it can be seen that if new products are to be trial-produced, consolidated, and put into production, it depends on the enterprise leaders solving specific problems in a down-to-earth manner, and these problems can only be solved well if the broad masses are mobilized in a down-to-earth manner. If these things are truly and practically done, the process of new products from trial production to batch production will definitely be accelerated.

    试制一项　巩固一项　投产一项
    衡量一个工厂增加产品品种的任务完成得好坏，不能单看试制了多少新产品，更重要的是看有多少种新产品确实试制成功，并且成批投入生产了。因此要提倡试制一项、巩固一项、投产一项的作法。
    要做到试制一项、巩固一项、投产一项，很关键的一条，是企业的领导者必须要发扬踏踏实实的工作作风。因为从试制新产品到成批生产新产品，是有许多具体问题需要解决的。比如在产品试制阶段里，因为产量少，需要的设备能力就不多。在成批投入生产后，设备能力不足的问题就显得突出了。如果不切切实实地解决这些具体问题，成批生产新产品就有困难。其次，在试制阶段内，一些问题，依靠一个车间、一个小组的群众力量就能解决了，可是在成批投入生产的时候，一些问题就不是一个车间、一个小组所能解决的，而必须发动全厂群众的力量来解决。因为只有广大群众的力量组织起来了，才能够充分发挥和挖掘企业内部的设备能力和人力的潜力。上海科培仪器厂在批判了部分干部不正确的思想以后，紧紧依靠全厂群众的力量，使许多原来认为无法解决的问题都迎刃而解，在短时期内使新产品能够成批投入生产，就是一个很好的例子。
    由此可见，新产品要做到试制一项、巩固一项、投产一项，有赖于企业领导者踏踏实实解决一个个具体问题，而这些问题要解决得好，又必须踏踏实实地发动广大群众。真正切实地做到了这一些，就一定能加速新产品从试制到成批生产的过程。
