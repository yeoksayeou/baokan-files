Multiple Fine Management Techniques Strive for Strong Sweet Potato Vines and Large Tubers
Wanxian Special District Seizes the Opportunity to Mobilize the Masses to Vigorously Promote Sweet Potato Production

(Our report) The broad masses of cadres and people in Wanxian Special District, Sichuan, are seizing the current favorable opportunity to vigorously and specially promote sweet potato (i.e., sweet potato) production, comprehensively tapping the potential for sweet potato yield increases from all aspects of management, planting, and harvesting.

The people in Wanxian Special District love to plant and eat sweet potatoes. The original plan for sweet potatoes planted during the spring production season was two million mu, but the actual planting reached three million mu. After the People's Daily published the editorial "Immediately Launch an Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement Centered on Grain and Steel," the Wanxian District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately and conscientiously implemented it. After repeated investigation and research, the District Committee believed that in order to strive for a larger grain harvest in the autumn, sweet potato production should be given priority at present. This is because: First, the spring sweet potatoes that have already been planted are currently in the period of tuber formation and root expansion, which is the key period for increasing production. As long as management is strengthened, the yield per unit area can be greatly increased. The experimental results of the Wanxian Agricultural Science Institute over the years show that sweet potatoes that are top-dressed with fertilizer during this period yield about 30% more per mu than those that are fertilized less. Second, there is still much potential for increasing the planting of autumn sweet potatoes. According to past experience, sweet potatoes can be planted until the end of August or even early September. The planting area of autumn sweet potatoes in the entire special district can continue to be expanded. Third, early preparation is made to ensure good harvesting work, and the potential for increasing production and practicing economy in this area is also great. Calculating on the basis of reducing throwing away 100 jin of sweet potatoes per mu, the entire district can harvest several hundred million jin more. Based on the above analysis, the District Committee immediately issued instructions to all parts of the district to vigorously and specially promote sweet potato production, requiring all localities to plant as many seedlings as possible, top-dress as much fertilizer as possible, and increase production as much as possible. A vigorous and down-to-earth new upsurge of vigorously and specially promoting sweet potato production was immediately launched throughout the district.

Mobilizing the masses to widely discuss sweet potato yield increase measures and taking action while discussing is a prominent feature of this sweet potato production campaign in Wanxian Special District. Party organizations in various counties have paid attention to mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate plans and measures to increase sweet potato production. All 3,400-plus production teams in the 72 communes of Wanxian County have universally held a special discussion meeting on increasing sweet potato production, with production teams and canteens as units. During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that there are many favorable conditions for continuing to plant and manage sweet potatoes on a large scale at present: (1) The autumn temperature this year is high, which is suitable for planting more autumn sweet potatoes; (2) This year, more spring sweet potatoes are planted, and there is no problem with seedlings for planting autumn sweet potatoes; (3) Now that the mid-season rice has begun to be harvested, the problem of land can also be solved as long as the mid-season rice fields are seized and utilized, and vacant fields and land are generally surveyed; (4) Recently, the number of people on the agricultural front line has increased greatly, and there is also a labor force. Therefore, everyone unanimously guaranteed that they would overfulfill the planned planting area of autumn sweet potatoes. In nine days, the county rushed to plant more than 68,000 mu.

Cadres at all levels going deep into the grassroots and leading production in a down-to-earth manner is another feature of the sweet potato production campaign in Wanxian Special District. Yan Hanmin, secretary of the District Committee, also personally went deep into Kaixian County, the largest county in the entire special district, to specifically lead sweet potato production. He not only discussed with the masses and put forward the key to managing sweet potatoes well at present - "two breaks and four grasps" (the two breaks are: break the idea of harvesting without management, break the idea of only treating golden flower beetles and not other pests; the four grasps are: grasp drought resistance, grasp top-dressing, grasp pest control, grasp weeding), but also went deep into the communes and teams to personally experiment with the commune members, found an effective method of treating leaf-rolling insects with 666 powder mixed with wild cotton water, and promoted it to various places. Xi Shide, deputy secretary of the Zhonghe District Committee in Kaixian County, discussed with the masses in the Changhong Management Area of Zhonghe Commune and found ways to plant sweet potatoes in mulberry seedling land, barren land, and house foundations, and to intercrop sweet potatoes in cornfields, helping this management area plant 113 mu more of autumn sweet potatoes. After the promotion of this experience in the whole district, a general survey of vacant fields and land was also universally carried out, so that the plan for increasing the planting of autumn sweet potatoes in the whole district was fully implemented to the land plots.

Thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people, the campaign to vigorously and specially promote sweet potato production in the whole district has now achieved great results. The sweet potatoes planted in the spring season are generally growing better than in previous years, and the planting progress of late autumn sweet potatoes in various counties has also accelerated. In the two days of August 16 and 17, the whole district planted more than 90,000 mu of sweet potatoes, and the daily progress was more than doubled compared with the original.

In order to ensure that sweet potatoes are harvested carefully and completely, Wanxian, Kaixian, Zhongxian and other places have begun to repair and manufacture new sweet potato digging plows to ensure that they meet the needs of sweet potato harvesting in time.

    多种细管力争甘薯藤壮块大
    万县专区抓紧时机发动群众大搞甘薯生产
    本报讯　四川万县专区广大干部、群众，抓住当前有利时机，大搞特搞红苕（即甘薯）生产，从管、种、收等各方面，全面挖掘红苕增产潜力。
    万县专区各地群众非常爱种红苕，爱吃红苕。今年大春生产栽种的红苕，原计划为二百万亩，最后实栽了三百万亩。人民日报发表了“立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”的社论以后，中共万县地委立即认真贯彻执行。地委经过反复调查研究以后，认为：为了力争秋收多打粮，当前应当突出的抓好红苕生产。因为：第一，已种下去的大春红苕，目前正在下头结实和块根膨胀期，是增产的关键时期，只要加强管理，单位产量就可提高很多。万县农业科学研究所历年试验情况表明，这个时期多施追肥的红苕，亩产量比施肥少的约多30％。第二，增种秋红苕还大有可为。据往年经验，红苕可以一直种到8月底甚至9月上旬。全专区的秋红苕栽种面积可以继续扩大。第三，及早准备，保证作好收获工作，这方面增产节约的潜力也很大。以每亩少抛撒一百斤红苕计算，全区就可多收几亿斤。基于上述分析，地委立即向全区各地发出了大搞特搞红苕生产的指示，要求各地做到能多栽一窝，就千方百计多栽一窝；能多追一道肥，就千方百计多追一道肥；能多增产一斤，就千方百计地多增产一斤。一个轰轰烈烈、踏踏实实的大搞特搞红苕生产的新高潮，随即在全区各地普遍掀了起来。
    发动群众广泛地讨论红苕增产措施，并且边讨论、边行动，是万县专区这次大搞红苕生产运动的一个突出特点。各县党组织都注意发动群众讨论和制定了增产红苕的计划和措施。万县全县七十二个公社的三千四百多个生产队，都普遍以生产队和食堂为单位，专门开过一次增产红苕的讨论会，在讨论中大家一致认为，目前继续大种、大管红苕的有利条件很多：（一）今年秋季气温高，正适宜多种秋红苕；
  （二）今年大春红苕种得多，种秋红苕的种苗也不成问题；（三）现在，中稻已开始收获，只要抓紧利用中稻田，并普查空田空土，土地问题也好解决；（四）最近上农业第一线的人大增，劳动力也有。因此，大家一致保证：要超额完成秋红苕的种植面积计划。九天时间，全县就抢栽六万八千多亩。
    各级干部深入基层，踏实地领导生产，是万县专区大搞红苕生产运动的另一特点。地委书记燕汉民也亲自深入到全专区最大的县——开县，具体领导红苕生产。他不仅与群众商量提出了当前管好红苕的
  “两破四抓”（两破是：破不管也收，破只治金花虫不管其他虫害；四抓是：抓抗旱、抓追肥、抓治虫、抓锄草）的关键，而且深入到社、队亲自与社员一道试验，找出了用六六六粉兑野棉花水治卷叶虫的有效办法，并且向各地推广。开县中和区区委副书记席世德，在中和社长虹管理区和群众商量，找出用桑苗地、二荒地、屋基地栽苕和大搞玉米地间种红苕的办法，帮助这个管区多种了一百一十三亩秋红苕。全区推广这一经验后，也普遍开展了普查空田空土运动，使全区增种秋红苕计划，全部落实到了地块。
    由于广大干部和群众干劲冲天，全区大搞特搞红苕生产的运动，现已取得很大成绩。大春时节栽种的红苕普遍都比往年长得好，各县晚秋红苕的种植进度也都加快。全区在8月16、17日两天中，就栽苕九万多亩，日进度比原来加快一倍多。
    为了保证在收获红苕时做到细收全收，万县、开县、忠县等地，已开始修理和新制挖苕犁，保证及时满足收苕需要。
