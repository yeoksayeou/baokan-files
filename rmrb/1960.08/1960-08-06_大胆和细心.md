    Boldness and Carefulness	Jiao Qizhen, Repair Worker, Machine Shop, Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Plant
    Machine tools are the most basic production tools in mechanical manufacturing. Maintaining their normal operation is heavily dependent on repair work. Repair workers who can quickly and effectively eliminate faults will reduce machine downtime. If machine downtime is too long, it will directly affect the completion of the national production plan. To do a good job in maintenance, one must be both bold and careful.
    At the end of 1959, all of our factory's employees launched a labor competition to enter 1960 ahead of schedule. Just at this critical juncture in production, the "528" model, a key machine tool responsible for processing spiral bevel gears, malfunctioned. The leadership asked us to urgently repair it, otherwise it would affect the completion of the factory's production tasks. We young men immediately started working, dismantling the machine tool in a flurry. The problem was found and fixed. However, many parts were forgotten in their original positions, and we couldn't figure out what to install first and what to install later. We were so anxious that we were at a loss, staring at the parts in frustration. We spent three days and three nights assembling it; however, because it was not assembled correctly, it almost caused an accident during the test run. Afterwards, each of us felt that this was too blind and too "bold."
    Not long after, the factory launched the "Dadu River Battle" production competition. On the last day of the campaign, which was also the most intense day of production, the key machine tool "115" model malfunctioned, and the situation was very urgent. At this time, we were again tasked with the repair. Having learned from the previous lesson, many comrades circled around the machine tool, afraid to start; some loosened here and tightened there, acting timidly. A night passed, but the problem was still not found, resulting in production losses. However, after inspection, it was found that only a screw cap on the oil pressure piston had come off, and all that was needed was to remove a cover and tighten the cap, which would have taken no more than fifteen minutes. Some comrades said: We were too "careful" this time.
    After studying Chairman Mao's works, we found the root cause of the problem. It turns out that there is a dialectical relationship between "boldness" and "carefulness." Being only bold without being careful turns boldness into recklessness, or being only careful without being bold restricts action; the two must be combined. Leaving either one behind in work will cause unnecessary losses. If boldness is not combined with carefulness, that is, if a cool, scientific analysis is not conducted, and one relies solely on enthusiasm to do things, this is not true boldness, and it will lead to blind actions and mess things up. Because this kind of boldness lacks a scientific analysis base and does not grasp the objective laws of things, it is bound to run into snags. Our first repair of the machine tool was like this, resulting in significant losses to production.
    Similarly, if carefulness is not combined with boldness, it is not true carefulness either. Because of a lack of the spirit of daring to think and act, a lack of the spirit of strategically despising difficulties, one will become a slave to objective laws, panicking and acting timidly in the face of difficulties, and becoming powerless. When we repaired the machine tool the second time, we committed this so-called "carefulness" sickness, which also caused losses to production.
    Therefore, from the two failures, we deeply realized that true boldness must be based on carefulness; at the same time, only under the guidance of a bold spirit can there be true carefulness, and the purpose of carefulness is to work even more boldly. Neither boldness nor carefulness can be ignored, otherwise, even if the subjective intention is good, it will bring unnecessary losses to the work.
    After understanding this principle, we greatly reduced accidents in our work. For example, the "526" model machine tool, which is no less complex than the "528" model, suddenly stopped at the beginning of this year. At this time, we first asked the operators about the situation of the machine tool stoppage, and then calmly began a comprehensive and repeated inspection, rotating each part, distinguishing its active and passive relationships in the crisscrossing of many shafts and gears, and carefully analyzed and studied it. Finally, we found that a long shaft had stopped rotating, but the surrounding parts had not malfunctioned. Why would this long shaft not rotate? At this time, we quickly analyzed that it was due to the oil passage being blocked and the sleeve being stuck. As a result, the "526" model machine tool was completely repaired in less than a day.

    大胆和细心	济南汽车制造厂机工车间机修工人　焦其振
    机床是机械制造最基本的生产工具，能不能保证机床的正常运转，维修工作占有很重要的地位。维修工人能又快又好地消除故障，就会减少机床的停息时间。如果机床停修时间过长，就会直接地影响国家生产计划的完成。要做好维修工作，就既要大胆又要细心。
    1959年年底，我们全厂职工为了提前跨入1960年，开展了劳动竞赛。就在这生产的紧要关头，担负着加工螺旋伞齿轮的关键机床“五二八”型出了毛病，领导要我们紧急抢修，否则就会影响全厂生产任务的完成。我们这些小伙子立即动起手来，一古脑地把机床拆卸开，毛病是找出来了，也修好了。但许多零件忘了原来的位置，先装什么，后装什么搞不清了，急的团团转，守着零件干发愁，整整装了三天三夜，才装好；可是由于装的不对头，在试车时几乎造成事故。事后，我们每个同志都觉得这件事干的太盲目，太“大胆”了。
    时间过了不久，厂里开展了“大渡河战役”的生产竞赛。到了战役的最后一天，也正是生产最紧张的一天，关键机床“一一五”型出了毛病，情况很紧急。这时我们又担负起抢修的任务。由于接受了上次的教训，因而许多同志围着机床打转转，不敢下手；有的这里松一下，那里紧一下，缩手缩脚，一夜的时间过去了，毛病仍未找出来，结果使生产遭到了损失。但事后经过检查，发现仅仅是油压活塞的一个螺丝帽脱落，只要卸下一个盖来，将帽扭上就可以了，总共用不了十五分钟。有的同志说：我们这件事又干的太“细心”了。
    学习了毛主席著作，我们才找到了病根子，原来“大胆”和“细心”之间有着辩证的关系。只大胆不细心，大胆就变成了蛮干，或者只细心不大胆，细心就会束缚住手脚；两者必须结合起来，在工作中离开了任何一方，都会造成不应有的损失。如果大胆不与细心结合起来，就是说不进行冷静的科学分析，单凭热情去办事，这就不是真正的大胆，就会出现盲目的行动，把事情办糟。因为这种大胆缺乏科学分析的基础，没有抓住客观事物的规律性，一定会碰钉子。像我们第一次抢修机床的情况就是这样，结果给生产造成很大的损失。
    同样，如果细心不与大胆结合起来，也不是真正的细心。因为缺乏敢想敢干的精神，缺乏在战略上藐视困难的精神，就会成为客观规律的奴隶，在困难面前就心慌意乱，缩手缩脚，无能为力。我们在第二次抢修机床时，就犯了这种所谓“细心”病，同样又给生产造成了损失。
    因此，从两次的失败中，我们深刻地体会到：真正的大胆必须以细心为基础；同时只有在大胆精神的指导下，才会有真正的细心，而细心的目的又是为了更大胆地进行工作。对于大胆和细心，不能忽视任何一方面，否则尽管主观愿望是好的，也会给工作带来不必要的损失。
    我们明白了这个道理以后，在工作中就大大减少了事故。例如复杂程度并不次于“五二八”型的“五二六”型机床，今年年初突然停住了。这时，我们首先向操作工人问明了机床停住的情况，然后便沉着地开始全面反复地检查，转动各个部分，在纵横交叉的许多轴和齿轮中间分清了它的主动和被动的关系，仔细地作了分析研究，最后找到了一根长轴停止了转动，但它周围的各个部件并未发生毛病，这根长轴为什么会不转动呢？这时我们就很快地分析出它是由于油路堵塞、套筒粘住了的毛病。结果不到一天的时间，“五二六”型机床就完全修好了。
