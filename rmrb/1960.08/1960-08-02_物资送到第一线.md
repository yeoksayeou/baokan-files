    Getting Materials to the Front Lines	Liang Guangjing
    Any work, once it has a clear guiding ideology, will generate powerful action. Recently, under the guidance of the idea that developing the national economy must be based on agriculture, Party committees at the county and commune levels across the country have been providing more detailed and solid leadership to agricultural production. Not only are cadres going deep into the front lines, and 80% of the labor force is being used in agricultural production, but every effort is being made to ensure that materials are also used on the front lines of agricultural production. The practice of Jintan County in Jiangsu Province is a very good example. The county committee sent 50% of its office cadres to production teams and public canteens; through reasonable arrangements, 80% of the rural labor force was used for agricultural production. They also concentrated materials to first meet the needs of agricultural production: concentrating timber to ensure the repair of agricultural boats, vigorously promoting the current manure accumulation movement; using wood instead of bamboo to ensure that every hoe has a handle, greatly facilitating the weeding of crops; the industrial sector saved 157 tons of diesel fuel, ensuring the normal operation of the county's water pumps and timely irrigation, and so on. Jintan County's approach of having both generals, soldiers, and weapons – strong generals, sufficient soldiers, and complete weapons – is a concrete manifestation of the Party committee's more comprehensive, in-depth, and meticulous strengthening of leadership over agricultural production. It is also a powerful measure to implement the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation."
    Of course, truly ensuring that more materials are used on the front lines of agricultural production is not that simple; it is necessary to grasp the key, identify contradictions, and use appropriate methods to resolve contradictions. Jintan County's experience in material supply also illustrates this point. In their material supply work, they grasped three key aspects: the source of goods, the allocation, and the usage. The source of goods is the prerequisite; only with a sufficient source of goods and timely delivery of materials can needs be guaranteed. Once the source of goods is resolved, the allocation work must be done well. Issuing allocation targets does not mean that the allocation problem is completely solved; there are still phenomena such as "giving to those who need it first, giving to those who need it later, not giving to those who don't need it, and giving more to those who demand it fiercely." Regarding this contradiction between first and later, it is resolved by the principle of "agriculture first, general use second." Immediately following, it is necessary to see whether these materials are truly used where they are most needed and the effectiveness of their use.
    These three links are interconnected; if one link is missing, it cannot be guaranteed that sufficient materials will truly be used for agriculture, truly supporting and promoting current production. The Jintan County Party Committee's solid and meticulous style of leading agriculture provides us with a good example worthy of our study.

    物资送到第一线	梁光景
    任何工作，有了明确的指导思想，就会产生有力的行动。最近，全国各地在发展国民经济必须以农业为基础的思想指导下，县、社党委对农业生产的领导是更加细致更加踏实了。不仅是干部深入第一线，80％的劳力用在农业生产上，并且千方百计地保证把物资也用到农业生产第一线。江苏省金坛县的做法就是一个很好的例子。县委员会把50％的机关干部下放到生产小队、公共食堂；通过合理安排，将80％的农村劳力用于农业生产。又集中物资首先满足农业生产上的需要：集中了木材，保证了农船的修理，有力地推动了当前的积肥运动；以木代竹，保证了每张锄头有柄子，大大有利于农作物锄草工作的进行；工业部门节约了一百五十七吨柴油，保证了全县戽水机的正常运转和及时灌溉，等等。金坛县这种有将有兵有武器，将强兵足武器全的做法，是党委更全面、更深入、更细致地加强对农业生产领导的具体表现。也是贯彻“以农业为基础”方针的一个有力措施。
    当然，要切切实实地保证把更多的物资用于农业生产第一线，也并不是那么简单的事；必须抓住关键，找出矛盾，用适当的方法解决矛盾。金坛县在物资供应方面，同样地说明了这个道理。他们在物资供应工作上，抓住了三个关键：货源关、分配关、使用关。货源是前提，有了充足的货源，并把物资及时地运到，才能保证需要满足需要。货源问题解决了，要作好分配工作。分配指标下达，并不等于分配的问题完全解决了，其中还有“先要的先给，后要的后给，不要的不给，要得凶的就多给”的现象。对于这先与后的矛盾，就用“先农业，后一般”的原则去解决它。紧接着还要看这些物资是否真正用在刀口上，以及使用的效果。
    这三个环节一环扣一环，少了一环，就不能保证有足够的物资真正用于农业，真正对当前的生产起支援和促进的作用。金坛县委这种踏实细致地领导农业的作风和做法，给我们提供了一个很好的榜样，值得我们学习。
