Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 11th: Vientiane Radio broadcast at 4:00 PM on the 11th the speech given by Captain Kong Le, Chairman of the Lao Revolutionary Committee, at a mass rally held at the Vientiane city stadium that afternoon. The full text is as follows:

Dear compatriots:

I was formerly the commander of the Second Parachute Battalion of the Royal Lao Army, and now I am speaking on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee. The reason I am carrying out this revolution is because I hope that our Laos can be safe and sound, and that there will be no tragic scene of fratricide. I have been a soldier for many years, so I am familiar with the lives of soldiers, and I have seen that since I joined the army in 1949, our country's civil war has never stopped. I believe that the civil war continues to expand due to foreign interference and the attempt of a certain political party to "gain without labor." We are very disgusted with the civil war, because it causes Laotians from north to south to kill each other. I am a soldier and only know how to do practical work. My friends and I have never seen foreign enemy invasions, but only Laotians engaged in meaningless self-destruction. If this continues, our country and people will be wiped out. Therefore, I hope that the government will guide our country onto the path of neutrality, that is, impartially neither participating in the free world nor the communist world. We will accept assistance from any country, but on the condition that it is not bound by political and military conditions. We will accept all foreign envoys to Laos. I know that many governments verbally advocate neutrality when they come to power, but they have never truly implemented neutrality. Therefore, in order to maintain the neutrality of our country, we are willing to make any sacrifices. Even if no country helps us, we must be neutral, and we can be self-reliant. Compatriots, please recall that before France ruled our country, our Laos was also independent for many years, resisted many countries, and won many battles, and these did not rely on any foreign assistance. At that time, we had neither a penny nor weapons, but we were still able to help each other and survive. Now, some of us know how to fly airplanes, and some have excellent knowledge, so why can't we be self-reliant and have to rely on foreign countries! If we want to rely on foreign countries, flatter them, and willingly accept their shackles, then our people will be driven and enslaved by them. The military and the people are one family, and mutual killing is useless. If we hope to achieve peace and hope that the country will return to normal, then all of us must help each other. If you want to rise, you must proceed gradually. No newly independent country can catch up with other countries all at once. Any powerful country in the world must proceed gradually. First of all, we must be self-reliant and not rely on foreign countries. Even if no one helps us, we must help each other, so that we can have happiness.

Government and military leaders have repeatedly announced that they will punish those who offer bribes, those who gain without labor, and those who harm public interests for personal gain, but these malpractices still occur. I don't like these people, I only like honest people. I am a soldier, and now I am the commander of a battalion, but I have nothing, only empty hands. Therefore, while I am still the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, I intend to liquidate those who offer bribes, those who betray the country, and those who harm public interests for personal gain, and will not allow them to appear in our country.

If we are neutral, we will not allow any country to establish military bases on our territory. I thank my compatriots for gathering here today to listen to my speech. My speech is not fluent, because I am not a politician. Please forgive me if there is anything wrong. We must carry out our work to the end.

If the people support us, we will stand firm, otherwise, we will not be able to stand. Our leadership is democratic, that is, everyone has the right to elect anyone. Political power belongs to the people. It's not that one person becomes an official and can arbitrarily appoint anyone to be an official. Personnel must be determined based on the majority. No matter what work, it cannot be successful without the support of the people. Before I carried out the revolution, the people in the rural areas where I was active had repeatedly persuaded me to carry out the revolution, but I did not believe whether they truly liked the revolution. Now, I am extremely disgusted, and I want to take action. I am carrying out the revolution to sacrifice for freedom, peace, neutrality, and the happiness of the people.

I cannot bear to see the Lao people become foreign slaves, become slaves of any political party. I hope everyone has the right to express opinions, write things, and carry out propaganda.

I pay my respects to all my compatriots. I don't have time to get close to all my compatriots, because I am very busy. The situation in the country still has many difficulties, and the government is not here, it has gone to the north, and there is also the south. I am stationed in the center of this city. Because the government is not here, the Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee and our faction have unanimously decided with the National Assembly, which represents the government, to send Prince Souvanna Phouma to invite the Prime Minister of the government to return, let him announce his resignation, and nominate Prince Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister. I suggest everyone applaud and cheer. I want to find someone who wants to bring peace to the country. Our army also likes to have such a person. If political and military work progresses slowly, please compatriots be patient and don't rush. Here, I express my gratitude to my compatriots and introduce to you our people: Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, Lieutenant Tun, he will give a speech to everyone on the issue of our revolution, please pay attention to listen. Please forgive me if there is anything wrong, and please remember what is right.

    贡勒在群众集会上谈政变目的
    表示希望停止内战摆脱外国束缚实行中立政策
    宣布要让松萨尼特辞职并提名富马亲王当首相
    新华社河内11日电　万象电台在11日下午广播了老挝革命委员会主席贡勒大尉当天下午四时在万象市运动场举行的群众集会上的讲话。全文如下：亲爱的同胞们：
    我过去是老挝王国军队伞兵第二营指挥官，现在代表革命委员会发表讲话。我这次所以干革命，是因为希望我们老挝能够平安无事，不出现自相残杀的惨象。我已经当兵多年，因此熟悉士兵的生活，并且看到，从我1949年参军到现在，我国的内战从来没有间断过。我认为，由于外国的干涉和某个政党企图“不劳而获”，内战才会继续扩大，我们非常厌恶内战，因为它促使自北到南的老挝人互相残杀。我是一个军人，只知道干实际工作。我和我的朋友们从来没有看见外来的敌人的侵略，而只看见老挝人进行无益的自相残杀。如果这样继续下去，我们国家和人民将会被消灭。因此，我希望政府引导我们国家走上中立的道路，即不偏不倚地既不参加自由世界、也不参加共产世界，任何国家给予援助我们都接受，但条件是不受政治和军事条件束缚。我们将接受所有外国使节来到老挝。我知道，有许多政府上台时口口声声说中立，但它们从来没有真正地实行中立。因此，为了维护我们国家的中立，我们不惜作出任何牺牲。尽管没有任何国家帮助我们，我们也要中立，我们可以自力更生。请同胞们回顾一下，在法国统治我国以前，我们老挝也曾经独立了许多年，曾经抗击过许多国家，曾经打了许多次胜仗，而这些却没有依靠任何外国的援助。那时，我们既没有一文钱，也没有武器，但我们仍然能够互相周济而活下来。现在，我们有的人懂得驾驶飞机，有的学问很好，那么，我们为什么不能自力更生而要依靠外国呢！如果我们要依靠外国，奉承他们，甘受他们的束缚，那么，我国人民就要被他们驱使和奴役。军民是一家，互相残杀是无益的。如果我们希望获得安宁，希望国家恢复常态，那么，我们全体人民必须互相帮助。欲要高升，必须逐步渐进。没有任何刚刚独立的国家，一下子就能够赶上其他国家。世界上的任何强国都必须逐步渐进。首先，我们必须自力更生，不要依靠外国。尽管没有人帮助，我们也要互相帮助，这样我们才有幸福。
    政府和军队的领导人曾经多次宣布要惩办行贿的人、不劳而获的人、损公利己的人，但是这种弊病仍然出现。我不喜欢这些人，只喜欢老实的人。我是一个军人，现在我是营的指挥官，但我甚么都没有，只有两手空掌。因此，当我还担任革命委员会主席的时候，我打算清算行贿的人、叛国的人、损公利己的人，不允许他们在我国出现。
    我们中立了，如果有任何一个国家想在我们国土上建立军事基地，我们就不允许。我感谢同胞们今天在这里聚集听我讲话。我的讲话不流利，因为我不是政治家，有什么不对，请大家原谅。我们的工作，我们一定要进行到底。
    如果人民支持我们，我们就站得稳，否则，我们就站不住。我们的领导是民主的，就是说，大家都有权选出任何人，政权是属于人民的，不是一个人作了官，就可以随便指定任何人作官。必须根据多数来确定人选，不管什么工作，没有人民的支持，就不能成功。我进行革命以前，在我进行活动的农村的人民，曾经多次劝我干革命，但我不相信他们是否真正地喜欢革命。如今，我已经厌恶透顶了，我要行动。我干革命，就是为自由、和平、中立和人民的幸福而牺牲。
    我不忍心看到老挝人民当外国奴隶，当任何政党的奴才，我希望大家都有权发表意见、写东西和进行宣传。
    我谨向全体同胞们致敬。我没有时间跟全体同胞接近，因为工作很忙。国家的局势还有许多困难，政府又不在这里，已经到北方去了，南方也有，我驻扎在这个城市的中心。因为政府不在这里，所以革命委员会主席和我们的派系已经同代表政府的国会一致决定派富马亲王去邀请政府首相回来，让他宣布辞职，并提名富马亲王当首相。我建议大家鼓掌欢呼。我是想找一个想给国家带来安宁的人。我们军队也喜欢有这样的一个人。如果政治和军事的工作进行得迟缓，请同胞们耐心等待，不要着急。在这里，我向同胞们表示感谢并向大家介绍我们的人：革命委员会副主席敦中尉，他就我们进行革命的问题向大家发表讲话，请大家注意听吧。有什么不对，请原谅，对的请记住。
