    "Pig Mama"
    Yu Fusheng
    A sow in the team farrowed prematurely, giving birth to seven piglets as small as mice. The next day, these little things, except for a slight trembling of their lips, looked as if they were dead. The breeder was at a loss, and some even suggested throwing the dead things away. But the new daughter-in-law, Xiao Guilan, disagreed. She touched each one and said to the team leader, "Piglets are so scarce now, how can we just throw them away? We should try to save them if we can!"
      "See what you can save!" someone said.
    "Okay, I'll take care of these five!" Xiao Guilan said, unbuttoning her new cotton coat and taking the five she thought could be saved home in her arms.
    Three days later, the five piglets were indeed saved. From then on, the team leader wanted to mobilize Xiao Guilan to become a breeder, but she refused. At this time, someone secretly gave her the nickname "Pig Mama."
    The second time, a sow in the home of Aunt Zhang, a neighbor, didn't have enough milk, and two piglets didn't get milk for three or four days, becoming thin and small, and so hungry that they couldn't even stand up. Aunt Zhang pondered for a long time, unable to make up her mind. She couldn't bear to abandon them, but she was afraid of exhausting the sow and the piglets wouldn't grow up. As a result, Xiao Guilan found out and took them away. She bought a baby's pacifier from the town, and fed them porridge several times a day, finally managing to raise the two piglets to the point where they could eat on their own.
    After Xiao Guilan saved the piglets twice, the reputation of "Pig Mama" spread. In particular, when the children in the village saw her, they would shout, "Pig Mama is here, Pig Mama is here!" This time, the team leader found Xiao Guilan and resolutely mobilized her to become a breeder; but she still firmly refused. Everyone couldn't figure out Xiao Guilan's thoughts.
    In fact, how could Xiao Guilan not want to be a breeder? But only her sister knew her concerns: mainly that she was afraid her husband would object. Her husband was a young worker in an agricultural machinery factory in the city, very active in his work, handsome, and capable. Xiao Guilan was afraid that he would dislike the dirty job of raising pigs.
    At this time, the team's small breeding farm was established, and two breeders were assigned to more than thirty pigs. These two breeders were also active, but they had no way to deal with the several old sows that were about to give birth. It happened to be a night when the northwest wind was blowing hard, and both old sows were about to give birth. After discussing it again and again, they braced themselves and went to Xiao Guilan. Without thinking, Xiao Guilan hurried over.
    Xiao Guilan arrived at the breeding farm and calmly directed those who started the fire to start the fire, and those who boiled soybean milk to boil soybean milk. Soon, both old sows gave birth, and everything went smoothly, but two of the last ones seemed to have suffocated. Xiao Guilan, like an obstetrician, hung the two piglets upside down by their legs and patted them for a while. Slowly, the two piglets breathed a sigh of relief.
    "Pig Mama really has a way!" the two breeders said half seriously and half jokingly.
    Xiao Guilan thought to herself, "Why am I unwilling to do it? He is a Communist Party member and will never object."
    The next day at noon, just as the team leader was eating, Xiao Guilan ran over excitedly. She blurted out, "Team leader, let me be the breeder!"
    "Ah!" The team leader slapped his chopsticks on the table, overjoyed.
    "I've thought it through, I'm willing to do it!" Xiao Guilan said almost word by word.
    "Then it's a deal!"
    Xiao Guilan felt as if she had put down a burden and was relieved. The team leader suddenly took out a letter from his pocket and waved it, "Here, it's from your man."
    Xiao Guilan rushed up, snatched it, and ran away, reading as she went:
    "...I heard from the commune secretary that you have been a Pig Mama twice, and you have a lot of experience. Please introduce your experience to me! You know, I have also become a temporary breeder in the factory. I volunteered to do this work. Raising pigs is one of the major things we need to do right now, you don't object, do you? I hope you also strive to be a model breeder..."
    Reading this, a warm current flowed through Xiao Guilan's whole body.

    “猪妈妈”
    余福生
    队里的一头母猪早产了，生下七只像老鼠那么大的小猪娃子。第二天，这几只小东西除了嘴唇有点哆嗦外，就像死的一样。把饲养员弄得没有办法，有的人还说把这死东西扔掉算了。可是新媳妇小桂兰不同意，她一只只地摸了摸，就向队长说：“现在猪苗这么紧，怎能随便扔掉呢？能够救活的总得救呵！”
      “看你救啥！”不知是谁说了这么一句。
    “好，这五只我来包！”小桂兰说着便解开新棉袄，把她认为可以救的五只，抱在怀里回家去了。
    三天以后，这五只小猪娃子果然得救了。从那时起，队长就想动员小桂兰当饲养员了，但她不答应。这时不知是谁偷偷替她起了一个“猪妈妈”的外号。
    第二回，邻居张大妈家里的一头母猪奶不够，有两只小猪娃子三四天吃不到奶，又瘦又小，饿得腿都站不起来。张大妈前思后想，打不定主意，想不留着吧，又舍不得；想留着吧，又怕累坏了母猪，小猪又长不大。结果呢，还是小桂兰知道后抱去了。她从镇上买回了一只小孩子吃的奶嘴子，一天几顿用粥汤喂，总算把两只猪娃子拉扯得能够自己吃食了。
    小桂兰两次救活了小猪娃子以后，猪妈妈的名声就传开来了。特别是村上的孩子看到她，都嚷着“猪妈妈来了，猪妈妈来了！”这一次，队长找到小桂兰，很坚决地动员她当饲养员；但是她还是坚决地回绝了。大家都摸不透小桂兰的心思。
    其实，小桂兰何尝不愿当饲养员呢？可她的心事只有她姐姐知道：主要是怕她爱人有意见。她爱人是城里农业机械厂的一个青年工人，工作很积极，人挺英俊，又能干。小桂兰就怕他嫌养猪这行当脏。
    这时候，队里的小养殖场建立起来了，三十几头猪配了两个饲养员。这两个饲养员也还积极，就是对几头即将临产的老母猪没有办法。刚巧遇到西北风刮得正紧的夜晚，两个老母猪全都要生产了。他们商量再三，就硬着头皮去找小桂兰。小桂兰什么也没考虑就连忙奔来了。
    小桂兰来到养殖场，不慌不忙地指挥着生火的生火，煮豆汁的煮豆汁。一会儿，两头老母猪都生产了，一切都很顺当，只是有两只最后下来的好像给闷死了。小桂兰像接生员似地倒挂着两只猪腿，拍打了一阵，慢慢地两只小猪就舒气了。
    “猪妈妈真有办法！”两个饲养员半认真半开玩笑似地说。
    小桂兰心里想：“为啥我不肯干呢？他是一个共产党员，决不会反对的。”
    第二天中午，队长刚在吃饭，小桂兰就兴冲冲地跑来了。她劈口就说：“队长，就让我做饲养员吧！”
    “啊！”队长将筷子在桌上一拍，惊喜万状。
    “我想通了，我愿意干了！”小桂兰几乎一字一板地说着。
    “那我们就一言为定啦！”
    小桂兰像放下了什么担子一样地轻松。队长忽地在怀里掏出一封信来，扬了一扬：“喏，你家他寄来的。”
    小桂兰上去一把抢过来飞奔地走了，一路上边走边看：
    “……听公社书记说，你做了两次猪妈妈了，很有经验，把经验介绍给我吧！你知道，我在厂里也当上了临时饲养员，我是自告奋勇做这工作的，养猪是我们当前的大事情之一，你不反对吧。我希望你也争取做个模范饲养员……”
    读到这里，一股暖流流过小桂兰全身。
