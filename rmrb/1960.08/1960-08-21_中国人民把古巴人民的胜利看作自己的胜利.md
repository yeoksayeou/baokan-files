    Wu Xiuquan Sends a Congratulatory Message to the National Congress of the Cuban People's Socialist Party
    The Chinese People Regard the Victory of the Cuban People as Their Own Victory
    The victory of the Cuban people's revolution is a heavy blow to the enemy of world peace, U.S. imperialism. It has set a brilliant example for the Latin American people's struggle to free themselves from American rule. The Cuban people have friends all over the world, and they will surely be able to crush any aggressive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of people all over the world. The people of all countries still face the serious threat of aggression and war from U.S. imperialism. As long as the people of all countries continue to expose the various conspiracies and tricks of U.S. imperialism, continue to maintain the greatest vigilance, form a united front of the people of the world against imperialism, and wage a tit-for-tat struggle against the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, they will surely be able to smash the U.S. imperialists' war and aggression plans and defend world peace. China has consistently made unremitting efforts to strive for world peace, oppose imperialist aggression, and strive to achieve peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems. The common cause of the Chinese and Cuban people against imperialism and in defense of world peace closely links us together. Thoroughly crushing modern revisionism, resolutely defending Marxism-Leninism and the Moscow Declaration, and strengthening the unity of the international communist ranks, strengthening the unity of the socialist camp, and strengthening the unity of the people of the world remain our sacred responsibilities.
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 19th - Wu Xiuquan, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and member of the CCP Central Committee attending the Eighth National Congress of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, delivered a congratulatory message to the Congress this afternoon on behalf of all members of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, and read out the congratulatory telegram from the CCP Central Committee.
    The full text of Wu Xiuquan's congratulatory message is as follows: Dear Comrades:
    I have come to your heroic country with the heart of 650 million Chinese people to participate in the Eighth National Congress of your Party, and I feel extremely excited. Now, please allow me to first represent all members of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people to express warm and fraternal congratulations to the Congress of your Party; and through your Congress, express our heartfelt respect to the heroic Cuban people.
    In these days, the Chinese people, together with the people of all countries in the world, are greeting and caring for the great victory of the Cuban people's revolution with the greatest enthusiasm.
    Cuba is a country very close to the United States and has been under the long-term rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. Under the cooperation of the patriotic and democratic forces headed by Fidel Castro and the Cuban People's Socialist Party, six million Cuban people united, held high the banner of national democratic revolution, dared to wage a tenacious struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys with a dauntless revolutionary spirit and unwavering revolutionary perseverance, and achieved a brilliant victory. The victory of the Cuban people's revolution is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, the enemy of world peace. It has set a brilliant example for the Latin American people's struggle to free themselves from American rule, and has greatly encouraged the struggle of the people of all countries in the world to strive for world peace and oppose imperialist aggression.
    Now, the Cuban revolutionary government is leading the Cuban people to continue to advance the Cuban revolution. In Cuba, the vigorous land reform movement has achieved great results, American companies that plundered Cuban wealth are gradually being nationalized, the subversive activities of counter-revolutionary forces have been resolutely suppressed, and the national economy is being restored and developed on a new basis. The achievement of all these achievements has further united the broad masses of the people, consolidated the Cuban revolutionary regime, and won the unanimous praise of progressive mankind all over the world.
    U.S. imperialism, which is the enemy of the people of the world, is by no means reconciled to its failure in Cuba. From the very beginning, U.S. imperialism attempted to strangle the Cuban people's revolution. U.S. imperialism has repeatedly instigated counter-revolutionary subversive activities; implemented various despicable tricks to undermine and strangle the Cuban national economy; and recently, it has prepared to further openly carry out armed intervention in Cuba. Now, Cuba is facing the serious danger of U.S. imperialist aggression. However, the heroic Cuban people are invincible. Since the Cuban people dared to achieve the victory of the revolution, they also dare to defend and consolidate the victory of the revolution. The whole world has seen that the Cuban people have not been intimidated by the threats of U.S. imperialism, but have become more strongly united, preparing to counterattack the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism at any time. The Cuban people have friends all over the world. The people of Latin American countries firmly stand on the side of the Cuban people, and the people of socialist countries and all peace-loving people all over the world also stand on the side of the Cuban people. With the united support of these forces, the Cuban people will surely be able to overcome various difficulties and smash any aggressive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism.
    U.S. imperialism is not only the enemy of the Cuban people, but also the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world. The war policy and aggressive policy implemented by U.S. imperialism have aroused increasingly strong resistance from the people of all countries in the world, making it fall into an increasingly isolated position. The nature of imperialism will never change. Despite a series of failures, U.S. imperialism is still stepping up its arms race and war preparations. Especially since last year, it has also adopted more cunning methods, under the guise of so-called "peace," "friendship," "tolerance," "restraint," etc., to intensify its activities of aggression and war preparation. Therefore, the people of all countries in the world still face the serious threat of aggression and war from U.S. imperialism. It is the masses of the people who decide the fate of mankind. As long as the people of all countries continue to expose the various conspiracies and tricks of U.S. imperialism, continue to maintain the greatest vigilance, unite all the forces that can be united except for the enemy, form a united front of the people of the world against imperialism, wage a tit-for-tat struggle against the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, and support and unite each other in the struggle, the people of all countries in the world will surely be able to smash the U.S. imperialists' war and aggression plans and defend world peace.
    We, the Chinese people, are now under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, holding aloft the three red banners of the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and people's communes, and are carrying out a tenacious struggle to build socialism and get rid of economic backwardness as soon as possible. We are confident that we will be able to build China into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture within a not-too-long period of time. In order to smoothly carry out socialist construction, we need a lasting peaceful international environment. Our country's socialist system also determines that we love peace and want to establish and develop normal relations with all countries. Therefore, our country has consistently made unremitting effort to strive for world peace, oppose imperialist aggression, and strive to achieve peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems.
    Comrades! Although China and Cuba are located on two continents, separated by vast oceans, the common cause of the two peoples against imperialism and in defense of world peace closely links us together. Since the victory of the Cuban revolution, the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban people has further developed. We have always regarded the struggle and victory of the Cuban people as our own struggle and victory, just as the Cuban people regard the struggle and victory of the Chinese people as the struggle and victory of the Cuban people. The friendship between the two peoples, consolidated in the common struggle against imperialism, will also be further developed with the passage of time.
    We are pleased to see that the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union are becoming increasingly prosperous and powerful. Encouraged by the continuous development of the socialist camp, the awakening and unity of the people of the world are also constantly developing. Imperialism is extremely afraid of the awakening and unity of the people of all countries. Therefore, they try every means to use modern revisionism to prevent the awakening of the people and undermine the unity of the people. It is precisely because of this that thoroughly crushing modern revisionism, resolutely defending Marxism-Leninism and the Moscow Declaration, strengthening the unity of the international communist ranks, strengthening the unity of the socialist camp, and strengthening the unity of the people of the world remain our sacred responsibilities.
    In the international communist ranks, the Cuban People's Socialist Party is a heroic fighting party with a glorious tradition. Your Party has already made extremely great contributions in winning the revolutionary victory of the Cuban people. Now your Party is formulating a new program of the Party based on the new situation of the development of the Cuban revolution and the will of the Cuban people to carry out the revolution to the end. We believe that this Congress of your Party will not only illuminate the path forward for promoting the Cuban revolution, but also make new contributions to the common cause of the international proletariat.
    I wish your Party's Congress a complete success.
    Now, please allow me to read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Congress of your Party:
              The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to
      The Eighth National Congress of the Cuban People's Socialist Party Dear Representative Comrades:
    On behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends warm and brotherly congratulations to the National Congress of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, and through your Congress, extends the most cordial greetings to the heroic Cuban people.
    From its inception, your Party, together with the Cuban people, has waged a long and arduous struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agents in Cuba. Your Party united with the Cuban democratic and patriotic forces headed by Fidel Castro, achieved the great victory of the Cuban revolution, and after the victory of the revolution, resolutely advocated carrying the revolution through to the end. Now, your Party and your people are waging a heroic struggle to defend the fruits of the revolution, safeguard national independence, and oppose U.S. imperialist aggression. We congratulate your Party on the great contributions it has made to the Cuban revolutionary cause.
    The victories that the Cuban people have already achieved have given great support and encouragement to the people of all countries in Latin America, all oppressed nations and peace-loving countries in the world. The people of all countries in Latin America regard the Cuban revolution as their own example. They will surely unite with greater confidence to carry out an unyielding struggle to strive for and safeguard their national independence, oppose the enslavement and oppression of U.S. imperialism, and for world peace and against imperialist aggression.
    The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people admire your heroic struggle very much. In your just struggle against U.S. imperialism, the Chinese people will always stand with you.
    We firmly believe that, under the current excellent international situation, the united, closely linked with the masses, and full of revolutionary fighting spirit Cuban People's Socialist Party, through this Congress, will surely be able to protect and promote the struggle of the Cuban revolution, in the struggle against modern revisionism, defending the revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism, and defending the unity of the international communist movement and the people of the world, to achieve greater victory.
    I wish your Party Congress a complete success! The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China August 15, 1960

    伍修权向古巴人民社会党全国代表大会致贺词
    中国人民把古巴人民的胜利看作自己的胜利
    古巴人民革命的胜利是对于世界和平的敌人美帝国主义的沉重打击，它为拉丁美洲人民争取摆脱美国统治的斗争树立了光辉的榜样。古巴人民的朋友遍于全世界，一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋。美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。世界各国人民仍然面临着美帝国主义的侵略和战争的严重威胁。只要世界各国人民继续不断揭露美帝国主义的各种阴谋诡计，继续保持最大的警惕，组成世界人民反对帝国主义的统一战线，同美帝国主义者及其走狗进行针锋相对的斗争，就一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的战争和侵略计划，保卫住世界和平。中国一贯地为争取世界和平，反对帝国主义侵略，争取实现不同社会制度国家的和平共处，进行了坚持不懈的努力。中国人民和古巴人民反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的共同事业，把我们紧密地联结在一起。彻底地粉碎现代修正主义，坚决捍卫马克思列宁主义和莫斯科宣言，加强国际共产主义队伍的团结，加强社会主义阵营的团结，加强全世界人民的团结，仍然是我们神圣的责任。
    新华社哈瓦那19日电　出席古巴人民社会党第八次代表大会的中国共产党代表、中共中央委员伍修权，今天下午代表中国共产党全体党员和中国人民向大会致祝词，并且宣读了中共中央的贺电。
    伍修权的祝词全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    我带着六亿五千万中国人民的心，来到你们英雄的国家，参加你们党的第八次代表大会，感到异常的兴奋和激动。现在请首先让我代表中国共产党全体党员和中国人民，向你们党的代表大会表示热烈的兄弟般的祝贺；并且通过你们的代表大会，向英勇的古巴人民表示衷心的敬意。
    在这些日子里，中国人民同世界各国人民一道，怀着最大的热情，欢呼着和关怀着古巴人民革命的伟大胜利。
    古巴是一个距美国近在咫尺，受到美帝国主义及其走狗长期统治的国家。在以菲德尔·卡斯特罗为首的爱国民主力量和古巴人民社会党的合作下，六百万古巴人民团结起来，高举起民族民主革命的旗帜，以大无畏的革命精神和坚韧不拔的革命毅力，敢于同美帝国主义及其走狗进行顽强的斗争，并且取得了辉煌的胜利。古巴人民革命的胜利是对于世界和平的敌人美帝国主义的一个沉重的打击，它为拉丁美洲人民争取摆脱美国统治的斗争树立了光辉的榜样，大大地鼓舞了世界各国人民争取世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略的斗争。
    现在，古巴革命政府正在领导着古巴人民继续推进古巴的革命事业。在古巴，轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动，已经取得巨大成果，掠夺古巴财富的美国企业正在逐步收归国有，反革命势力的颠复活动受到了坚决的镇压，民族经济正在新的基础上恢复和发展。所有这一切成就的取得进一步地团结了广大人民群众，巩固了古巴革命政权，并且赢得了全世界进步人类的同声赞扬。
    以世界人民为敌的美帝国主义绝不甘心它在古巴的失败。从一开始，美帝国主义就企图扼杀古巴人民的革命。美帝国主义曾经几次三番地策动了反革命的颠覆活动；施行了各种卑鄙的伎俩，破坏和扼杀古巴的民族经济，最近更准备进一步公开进行武装干涉古巴。现在，古巴正面临着美帝国主义侵略的严重危险。但是，英雄的古巴人民是不可战胜的。古巴人民既然敢于取得革命的胜利，也就敢于保卫和巩固革命的胜利。全世界都看到，古巴人民并没有被美帝国主义的威胁所吓倒，而是更加坚强地团结起来，准备随时反击美帝国主义的武装侵略。古巴人民的朋友遍于全世界。拉丁美洲各国人民坚决地站在古巴人民方面，社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民也站在古巴人民方面。在这些力量的联合支持下，古巴人民是一定能够克服各种困难，粉碎美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋的。
    美帝国主义不仅是古巴人民的敌人，而且是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义所实行的战争政策和侵略政策，已经引起世界各国人民越来越强烈的反抗，使它陷于越来越孤立的地位。帝国主义的本性绝不会改变。尽管遭到一系列的失败，美帝国主义仍然在加紧扩军备战。特别是去年以来，它还采取更加狡猾的手段，在所谓“和平”，“友谊”，“容忍”，“克制”等等假面具下，加紧进行侵略和备战的活动。因而世界各国人民仍然面临着美帝国主义的侵略和战争的严重威胁。决定人类命运的从来是人民群众，只要世界各国人民继续不断地揭露美帝国主义的各种阴谋诡计，继续保持最大的警惕，团结除敌人以外的一切可以团结的力量，组成世界人民反对帝国主义的统一战线，同美帝国主义者及其走狗进行针锋相对的斗争，并且在斗争中互相支持和互相团结，那么，世界各国人民一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的战争和侵略计划，保卫住世界和平。
    我们中国人民，现在正在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会的领导下，高举社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗，为建设社会主义和尽速摆脱经济上的落后状态，进行着顽强的斗争。我们有信心，能够在不太长的时期内，把自己的国家建成为一个有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的强大的社会主义国家。为着顺利地进行社会主义建设，我们需要一个持久和平的国际环境。我们国家的社会主义制度，也决定了我们爱好和平，愿意同一切国家建立和发展正常关系。因此，我们国家一贯地为争取世界和平，反对帝国主义侵略，争取实现不同社会制度国家的和平共处，进行了坚持不懈的努力。
    同志们！尽管中国和古巴分处两个大陆，隔着辽阔的大洋，但是，两国人民反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的共同事业，把我们紧密地联结在一起。自从古巴革命胜利以来，中国和古巴人民的友谊有了进一步的发展。我们一向把古巴人民的斗争和胜利，看作是自己的斗争和胜利，正像古巴人民把中国人民的斗争和胜利看作是古巴人民的斗争和胜利一样。在反对帝国主义共同斗争中所巩固起来的两国人民的友谊，随着时间的增长，也将会得到更大的发展。
    我们高兴地看到，现在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国日益繁荣和日益强大。在社会主义阵营不断发展的鼓舞下，世界人民的觉醒和团结，也在不断发展。帝国主义是极其害怕各国人民的觉醒和团结的，因此他们就想尽方法地利用现代修正主义来阻止人民的觉醒和破坏人民的团结。正是因为这样，所以彻底地粉碎现代修正主义，坚决捍卫马克思列宁主义和莫斯科宣言，加强国际共产主义队伍的团结，加强社会主义阵营的团结，加强全世界人民的团结，仍然是我们的神圣的责任。
    在国际共产主义队伍中，古巴人民社会党是一个富有光荣传统的英勇斗争的党。在为赢得古巴人民的革命胜利中，你们党已经作出了极其巨大的贡献。现在你们党又根据古巴革命胜利发展的新形势，和古巴人民要求把革命进行到底的意志，制订党的新的纲领。我们相信，你们党的这次代表大会，不仅将为推进古巴革命事业照亮前进的道路，而且也将为国际无产阶级的共同事业作出新的贡献。
    我祝贺你们党的代表大会圆满成功。
    现在请允许我宣读中国共产党中央委员会致你们党代表大会的贺电：
              中国共产党中央委员会致
      古巴人民社会党第八次全国代表大会的贺电古巴人民社会党第八次全国代表大会亲爱的代表同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会谨代表中国共产党全体党员和中国人民，向古巴人民社会党全国代表大会致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺，并且通过你们的大会，向英勇的古巴人民致以最亲切的问候。
    你们的党从一成立就和古巴人民一起，向美帝国主义及其在古巴的代理人进行了长期的、艰苦卓绝的斗争。你们党同以菲德尔·卡斯特罗为首的古巴民主爱国力量团结在一起，取得了古巴革命的伟大胜利，并且在革命胜利以后，坚决地主张把革命进行到底。现在，你们党和你们人民正在为保卫革命果实，维护
  民族独立，反对美帝国主义侵略进行着英勇的斗争。我们祝贺你们党对古巴革命事业作出的巨大的贡献。
    古巴人民已经取得的胜利，给予了拉丁美洲各国人民、全世界一切被压迫民族和爱好和平的各国人民以极大的支持和鼓舞。拉丁美洲各国人民把古巴革命看作是自己的榜样，他们一定会以更大的信心，为着争取和维护本国的民族独立，反对美帝国主义的奴役和压迫，为着世界和平和反对帝国主义侵略，而联合起来，进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    中国共产党和中国人民十分钦佩你们的英勇斗争。在你们反对美帝国主义的正义斗争中，中国人民永远和你们站在一起。
    我们深信，在目前大好的国际形势下，团结一致的、密切联系群众的、富有革命斗争精神的古巴人民社会党，通过这次大会，一定能在保卫和推进古巴革命的斗争中，在反对现代修正主义，捍卫马列主义的革命精神，维护国际共产主义运动和世界人民的团结的斗争中，取得更大的胜利。
    祝你们党代表大会圆满成功！　中国共产党中央委员会　1960年8月15日
