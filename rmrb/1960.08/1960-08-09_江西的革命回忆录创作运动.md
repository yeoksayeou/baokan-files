The writing of revolutionary memoirs, under the leadership of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, has developed into a massive mass movement in Jiangxi. This is a new flower of socialist literature and a fruitful result of the mass literary and artistic creation movement since 1958. The reason why this creative movement can be widely launched in Jiangxi is inseparable from the direct leadership of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and the active participation of many responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee. Yang Shangkun's "Difficult Years," "Red Guangdong-Jiangxi Border," Shao Shiping's "Two and a Half Rifles Make Revolution," "The Story of the Gun," Deng Hong's "Pan Hu," "Adventure in the Mountains," Liu Junxiu's "Struggle on the Death Line," Miao Min's "The Fighting Life of Fang Zhimin," etc., are all excellent works that have emerged in this creative movement. According to statistics, the published revolutionary memoirs in the past two years amount to more than two million words. Among them, many works have had a great impact on readers in Jiangxi and even throughout the country. Of course, the writing of revolutionary memoirs is not unique to Jiangxi, and it also exists in other regions. However, I would like to explore the situation of the revolutionary memoirs writing movement in Jiangxi and share some opinions.

I

The great development of revolutionary memoirs is a recent phenomenon in the last two years, and it has become an important part of socialist literature in our country. The emergence of this kind of literary work is not accidental, but has deep historical and social roots. The glorious historical road of the Chinese revolution is long and tortuous. The experience of the Chinese revolution is extremely rich and colorful. The writing of revolutionary memoirs in Jiangxi is concentrated in the period of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, which is not accidental. The Second Domestic Revolutionary War was the most important stage in the history of the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao's correct political and military lines and great strategic and tactical thinking had already taken shape during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, and had been theoretically summarized in the works of Mao Zedong. However, in literature, the reflection of the domestic revolutionary war period, except for a small part of extremely valuable Soviet area literary works that have been preserved, has not been widely and profoundly reflected. The reason is, as Chairman Mao said: "The revolutionary literary and art movement made great progress during the ten-year civil war. This movement and the revolutionary war at that time were consistent in the general direction, but they were not integrated in actual work, because the reactionaries at that time separated these two fraternal armies." After liberation, everyone studied Party history, and organizations, schools, and factories everywhere asked veteran cadres to tell revolutionary stories. The listeners wanted to hear more and more, and the speakers felt more and more the need to organize it into writing. In 1958, driven by the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, the literary and artistic creation movement also greatly developed. A large number of revolutionary memoir works from this period emerged like mushrooms after a rain. The appearance of these works immediately won over many readers. It has extremely important value in helping our people understand and study the history of revolutionary struggle.

A large number of veteran cadres participating in the creation of revolutionary memoirs not only educated the broad masses of young people about revolutionary traditions, but also had a more far-reaching significance. The participation of veteran cadres in literary creation added a backbone force to the literary team. At the same time, in the process of cooperative creation, a group of new forces was also cultivated.

Revolutionary memoirs not only have great revolutionary historical cognitive value and educational effect, but also have the characteristics of revolutionary history. First of all, revolutionary memoirs have a clear fighting color, reflecting the characteristics of proletarian socialist revolutionary literature. In many memoir works, the description of war forms a sharp contrast with the revisionists' description of war, and they are completely insulated from pessimism and decadence. They carry forward the fighting tradition of our revolutionary literature. They do not write about war in a tragic and miserable way, but enthusiastically praise the people's revolutionary war. While exposing the brutal nature of the enemy, they focus on writing that the revolutionary forces always overwhelm the counter-revolutionary forces and achieve victory, indicating the inevitable final victory of the revolution. Many works not only write about the various difficulties and hardships of the past revolutionary struggles, but also write about the revolutionary fighters' overwhelming revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism. It provides us with a good example of the correct portrayal of communist-style heroic figures among workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Secondly, revolutionary memoirs have a clear class nature. They take workers, peasants, and soldiers as the objects of depiction, directly express their struggles and lives; and workers, peasants, soldiers, and their cadres personally participate in the creation. Because the authors of revolutionary memoirs have long been educated by the Party and tempered by the revolution, they can stand on the proletarian standpoint, correctly reflect the true face of revolutionary struggle life, and their works are permeated with revolutionary ideals and filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, which has the power to shock people's hearts and inspire fighting spirit. This feature fully proves the importance and absolute necessity of Chairman Mao's request that revolutionary writers unconditionally and wholeheartedly go deep into the masses, deep into life, and the fiery struggle.

For the development of socialist literature and art, revolutionary memoirs also provide rich and vivid materials for the creation of large-scale revolutionary historical long literary works. The great significance in this regard will become increasingly apparent with the development of China's socialist literary and art cause.

Of course, revolutionary memoirs are just beginning to shine, and the things that have been unearthed now seem like a huge treasure, only a very small part has been excavated. In this respect, it can be said that there is a lot to be done and the prospects are limitless. Taking Jiangxi as an example, it is an important source of the Chinese revolution—the Anyuan strike, the August 1st Nanchang Uprising, the creation of the Jinggangshan first revolutionary base area, the establishment of the four Soviet areas (the base area accounts for two-thirds of the province and one-third of the population), the red capital Ruijin, the lives of the people in the Soviet area, the growth of the Red Army (about four to five hundred thousand people in Jiangxi joined the Red Army), the warm support of the people in the Soviet area for the Red Army, the smashing of the enemy's four "encirclements and suppressions" and thousands of battles of all sizes, the three-year guerrilla war, the leaders of the Party and the state and other responsible comrades who led the struggle in Jiangxi for a long time and with great hardship, and the folk legends about revolutionary leaders..., such a vast revolutionary treasure trove, how much there is to write about, it is simply inexhaustible. Although the creation of revolutionary memoirs has achieved great results, both in terms of quantity and quality, it is far from meeting the needs and requirements of the broad masses of readers. Therefore, the revolutionary memoirs writing movement should be launched with greater effort, more planned, more organized, and more systematically in an all-round way to win greater harvests.

II

Based on the situation of the revolutionary memoirs writing movement in Jiangxi over the past two years, we believe that in order to write more and better memoirs, we must seriously study and summarize the experience of how to specifically rely on the Party committees and mobilize the masses, how to organize literary and art workers to cooperate with veteran cadres, and how to improve the quality of memoirs.

Regarding the issue of relying on the Party's various levels of organization and carrying out a large-scale mass movement, this is the key to doing a good job in creating revolutionary memoirs.

The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to the education of revolutionary traditions and has been implementing Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry forward revolutionary traditions and strive for greater glory." Since liberation, comrades Shao Shiping, Liu Junxiu, vice governor Deng Hong and other comrades of the Provincial Party Committee have been frequently invited to various organizations, troops, and schools to tell revolutionary stories. On this basis, the first batch of revolutionary memoirs was produced. These include Shao Shiping's "Two and a Half Rifles Making Revolution," Liu Junxiu's "Struggle on the Death Line," Deng Hong's "Revolution Must Consider the Masses Everywhere," Wei Xiuying's "Glorious Jiangxi Women," Hu Delan's "Stories of Several Revolutionary Women in the Old Red Areas of Northeast Jiangxi," and so on. When the Provincial Party Congress was convened in 1956, the Provincial Party Committee called on the veteran cadres attending the meeting to write revolutionary memoirs, and organized more than 20 literary and art cadres to visit the veteran cadres at the meeting and collect nearly two million words of original materials. Deng Hong's "Pan Hu" and "Adventure in the Mountains" were sorted out after this visit. In 1958, the Provincial Party Committee called for carrying out a mass literary and artistic creation movement, emphasizing that veteran cadres should write revolutionary memoirs, and held writing seminars for veteran cadres several times. The Jiangxi Daily published an editorial entitled "Mobilize Veteran Cadres to Engage in Literary and Artistic Creation." The Provincial Party Committee also instructed local Party committees to closely combine the writing of revolutionary memoirs with the compilation of county chronicles and Party history. Under the personal leadership of Comrade Fang Zhichun, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Party History Research Office was formally established in May 1958, and two provincial revolutionary history work conferences were successively held, proposing the call for "working together from top to bottom, compiling local revolutionary history at all levels," and local counties and counties have successively established revolutionary history compilation offices, with a total of nearly 30,000 revolutionary veterans interviewed. On this basis, more than 60 counties have written drafts of local revolutionary history, and eight counties have written local chronicles. The widespread development of this work has played a powerful role in promoting and supporting the development of the revolutionary memoir creation movement. Under the great encouragement and influence of the Provincial Party Committee's call and the personal writing of memoirs by Yang Shangkun, the first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, the revolutionary memoirs creation movement in the province was launched more rapidly and widely.

The specific work of deeply developing the writing of revolutionary memoirs must closely rely on Party committees at all levels. From formulating plans, organizing forces, collecting materials, formulating outlines, guiding writing to reviewing and finalizing drafts, the entire process and important links must be carried out under the direct guidance of Party committees at all levels. Formulating plans should be both top-down and bottom-up. The upper level must put forward requirements, but only by the Party committees at all levels putting forward specific plans and topics can it be more practical and reliable, and the implementation will be able to give full play to high enthusiasm. After the plan is set, it is necessary to organize forces. During this period, it is necessary to conduct in-depth mobilization to make the plan meet the masses, establish special agencies, and run writing training classes. Organizing forces is a process of mobilizing the masses. Without the mobilization of the broad masses, the vast revolutionary historical facts cannot be collected. Because the people in the old revolutionary base areas of Jiangxi love the past revolutionary struggles, they are extremely enthusiastic and eager to actively provide materials when they talk about writing the history of revolutionary struggles. For example, Zhang Zhulin and Gu Lesheng, old workers of Pingxiang Coal Mine, said: "If the predecessors do not tell the old stories, the later generations will have less understanding. Chairman Mao knows about Anyuan, Chairman Liu knows, Comrade Li Lisan knows, and our old workers know. Chairman Mao and Chairman Liu are very busy managing national affairs. If we don't recall it, it will be lost in the future." The key targets of mobilization should be veteran cadres, old workers, revolutionary veterans and literary and art workers.

III

Although Jiangxi has already made a lot of gains in writing revolutionary memoirs, it still faces the problem of continuously improving quality. As I have mentioned above, the glorious road of China's revolutionary history is long and tortuous; the true revolutionary stories are vast; and the revolutionary experiences of the veteran cadres are also very rich. Therefore, how to preserve these true stories that deeply record our revolutionary history and vividly reflect the heroic spirit of the revolutionary people in our country is a question that needs further study. In my opinion, a complete memoir work must clearly reflect Mao Zedong Thought in its ideological content, correctly express the Party's principles and policies, and vividly and realistically depict the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Party and the masses, so as to give people tremendous ideological encouragement. In my opinion, while carrying out large-scale mass movements, we must also strengthen leadership and organization research work, so that the entire writing of revolutionary memoirs can be carried out in an organized and planned manner, just like "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire", "Red Storm", "Red Guangdong-Jiangxi Border", and "Difficult Years", comprehensively and vividly reflect the true face of each stage of our revolutionary history, show the reality of the overall era, the reality of the development of the revolution, and illuminate our present and future path of advancement. Doing so will further enhance the educational effect of revolutionary memoirs. At the same time, better artistic processing is also very important for memoir works. When processing, collators should focus on selecting materials, arranging plots, and polishing words. And this can only be done well with a deep understanding of the ideological content. Chairman Mao said: "Although human social life is the only source of literature and art, and although it has incomparably vivid and rich content compared with the latter, the people are still not satisfied with the former and require the latter. Why is this? Because although both are beautiful, the life reflected in literary and artistic works can and should be higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than ordinary actual life, and therefore more universal." But without raw materials or semi-finished products, there is no way to process them, so the processing process must be combined with the research process. What to study? Study the forms of mass struggle, the forms of mass life, and the language of the masses in the era described by the veteran cadres. This is an improvement that starts from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, an improvement along the direction of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and an improvement that is needed by the masses. Improvement is to better learn from the masses and learn from the life of the masses. The improvement of the creation and processing of memoir works is to learn from veteran cadres, to seriously study all the life and struggle materials of veteran cadres, and then it is possible to write things with higher ideological and artistic value. Some of our authors want to write long novels about revolutionary history themes. Well, if they seriously study all relevant revolutionary historical materials, seriously read and study a large number of memoir works, personally assist veteran cadres in organizing revolutionary struggle memoirs and seriously learn from veteran cadres, and deeply immerse themselves in mass struggle life for a long time and thoroughly transform their world outlook, we believe that many excellent long works on historical themes can definitely be created. It should be said that writing a work now is easier than in the past. In the past, there was no mass literary and artistic creation movement, but now there are a large number of mass literary and artistic works that provide us with good nutrition. The problem is to study hard and invest in the struggle. But at the same time, we must also see that now that there are more works by the masses, the masses' demands are also stricter. The masses demand to see things that are higher than their own works. Therefore, to become a revolutionary writer whose own works have a huge impact on the masses, we must treat ourselves with new and higher demands. This requires more arduous efforts, and there is no easy way.

In order to improve the quality of memoir works, we must also strengthen research and commentary work. This requires mass commentary, expert commentary, and also veteran cadre commentary. The call of veteran cadres, the writing of veteran cadres, and the commentary of veteran cadres are all central issues for carrying out the memoir creation movement and improving the quality of works.

We hope that more veteran cadres will participate in the commentary work of memoir works, and we also hope that more literary critics will pay more attention to memoir works and write more good commentary articles. Let us work together to promote the further development of the revolutionary memoir creation movement and strive to write more and better epics that express the heroic era!

    江西的革命回忆录创作运动	中共江西省委宣传部副部长　李定坤
    在中共江西省委的领导下，革命回忆录的创作，在江西已经形成一个声势浩大的群众运动。这是社会主义文学创作的新花，也是1958年以来群众文艺创作运动的丰硕成果。这个创作运动在江西所以能广泛地展开，是和中共江西省委的直接领导，省委许多负责同志积极参加密不可分的。杨尚奎同志的《艰苦的岁月》、《红色赣粤边》，邵式平同志的《两条半枪闹革命》、《枪的故事》，邓洪同志的《潘虎》、《山中历险记》，刘俊秀同志的《死亡线上的斗争》，缪敏同志的《方志敏战斗的一生》等，都是在这个创作运动中出现的优秀作品。统计两年来的成果，已出版的革命回忆录的作品约在二百万字以上。其中有不少作品，在江西以至于在全国读者中间，都产生了很大的影响。当然，革命回忆录的写作并非江西的独创，在其他地区也有。不过，我想就革命回忆录的创作运动在江西开展的情况，做一些探讨，谈一些意见。		一
    革命回忆录的大发展，还是近两年来的事，它已经成了我国社会主义文学的重要组成部分。这种文学作品的产生并不是偶然的，而是有着深厚的历史根源和社会根源的。中国革命的光荣历史道路，是长期而曲折的。中国革命的经验是极为丰富多彩的。而江西的革命回忆录的写作，所以集中在第二次国内革命战争时期，也并非偶然。第二次国内革命战争，是中国革命历史上最重要的阶段。毛主席的正确的政治路线、军事路线和伟大的战略、战术思想在第二次国内革命战争时期就已经形成，在毛泽东著作中已经做了理论的概括。可是在文学上，关于国内革命战争时期的反映，除了仅有的保留下来的一部分极为珍贵的苏区文学作品以外，却没有得到广泛而深刻的反映，其原因正如毛主席所说的：“革命的文学艺术运动，在十年内战时期有了大的发展。这个运动和当时的革命战争，在总的方向上是一致的，但在实际工作上却没有互相结合起来，这是因为当时的反动派把这两支兄弟军队从中隔断了的缘故。”解放了，大家学习党史，机关学校工厂到处都要求老干部讲革命故事，听者愈听愈想听，讲者愈讲也愈觉得需要把它整理成文。1958年，在总路线、大跃进的推动下，文艺创作运动也有很大发展，关于这一时期大批的革命回忆录作品便像雨后春笋一样应运而生了。这些作品的出现，立刻赢得了众多的读者。它在帮助我们人民对于革命斗争史的了解和研究上，有着极其重要的价值。
    大批老干部参加革命回忆录的创作，这一件事情，不仅仅对广大青年进行了革命传统的教育，而且还有着更为深远的意义。老干部参与文学创作，使文学队伍增加了一批骨干。同时，在合作创作过程中，还培养了一批新生的力量。
    革命回忆录不仅具有巨大的革命历史的认识价值，教育作用，而且具有革命历史的特点。首先革命回忆录具有鲜明的战斗的色彩，表现了无产阶级社会主义革命文学的特征。在许多回忆录作品中，关于战争的描写，和修正主义者对战争的描写，形成了针锋相对的鲜明对照，它们和悲观主义、颓废主义是完全绝缘的。它们发扬了我国革命文学的战斗传统，他们不是把战争写的凄凄惨惨，而是热情地歌颂人民的革命战争。在揭露敌人的残暴本质的同时，着重写出了革命的力量总是压倒反革命力量而取得胜利，昭示了革命的必然最后胜利。许多作品既写出了过去革命斗争的种种艰难困苦，也写出了革命战士们那种压倒一切的高度的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义精神。在对工农兵群众中共产主义式的英雄人物的正确描绘上，给我们提供了很好的范例。
    其次，革命回忆录具有鲜明的阶级性。它们以工农兵为描写对象，直接表现了他们的斗争和生活；并且是工农兵及其干部亲自参加创作。由于革命回忆录的作者们长期受到党的教育，革命的锻炼，所以他们能够站在无产阶级立场上，正确地反映革命斗争生活的真实面貌，在他们的作品里渗透着革命的理想，充满了革命的热情，具有震撼人心、鼓舞斗志的力量。这个特色充分地证明了毛主席要求革命作家无条件地、全心全意地深入群众、深入生活和火热的斗争中去的重要性和绝对必要性。
    对于社会主义文学艺术事业的发展来说，革命回忆录还为创造大型的革命历史的长篇文学著作，提供了丰富的、生动的素材。在这方面的重大意义，将随着我国社会主义文艺事业的发展而日益显示出来。
    当然，革命回忆录还只是初放光芒，现在挖掘出来的东西，好像一个巨大的宝藏，只发掘了很小很小的一部分。在这方面可以说，还大有可为，前景无量。就以江西来说，这里是中国革命的重要策源地——安源大罢工、八一起义、井冈山第一个革命根据地的创造、中央苏区等四个苏区的建立（根据地占全省三分之二地区，三分之一人口）、红色首都瑞金、苏区人民的生活、红军的壮大（江西人民参加红军的约有四、五十万人）、苏区人民热烈支援红军、粉碎敌人四次“围剿”及大大小小千万次的战斗、三年游击战争、党和国家领导人以及其他各方面负责同志在江西长期艰苦地领导斗争，以及民间流传关于革命领袖的传说故事……，如此浩如烟海的丰富革命宝藏，该有多少东西可写，简直是挖掘不尽的。现在革命回忆录创作，虽已取得很大成就，但无论是数量还是质量，都远远赶不上广大读者的需要和要求。因此，革命回忆录的创作运动，还应当鼓足更大干劲，更有计划、更有组织、更有系统地全面展开，以夺取更大的丰收。		二
    根据两年多来江西开展革命回忆录创作运动的情况来看，我们认为，要写出更多更好的回忆录作品，就必须对于如何具体依靠党委和发动群众，如何组织文艺工作者与老干部合作，如何提高回忆录作品的质量等问题，认真加以研究，总结经验。
    关于依靠党的各级组织和大搞群众运动问题，这是搞好革命回忆录创作的关键。
    中共江西省委非常重视革命传统的教育工作，一直在贯彻毛主席的“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的指示。解放以来，省委书记邵式平、刘俊秀、副省长邓洪等同志经常被邀请到各机关、部队、学校讲革命故事，在这个基础上产生了第一批革命回忆录。这里有邵式平的《两条半枪闹革命》，刘俊秀的《死亡战线上的斗争》，邓洪的《革命要处处为群众着想》，危秀英的《光荣的江西妇女》，胡德兰的《赣东北老红色区几个革命妇女的故事》等。1956年召开省党代表大会时，省委号召到会老干部写革命回忆录，并组织了二十多个文艺干部对开会的老干部进行了访问，搜集了近二百万字的原始材料。邓洪同志的《潘虎》、《山中历险记》就是在这次访问之后整理出来的。1958年省委号召开展群众文艺创作运动，强调要老干部写作革命回忆录，几次召集老干部举行了写作座谈会，江西日报发表了《发动老干部进行文艺创作》的社论。省委还指示各地党委，把革命回忆录的写作与编写县志、党史等工作密切结合起来。在省委书记方志纯同志亲自主持下，1958年5月正式成立了省委党史研究室，先后召开了两次全省革命史工作会议，提出了“上下一齐动手，层层编写地方革命史”的号召，各地、县都相继成立了革命史编纂办公室，总共访问革命老同志近三万人。在此基础上，有六十多个县写出了地方革命史初稿，八个县写出了地方志。这一工作的广泛展开，对革命回忆录创作运动的开展，起了很有力的推动和支持作用。在省委号召、省委第一书记杨尚奎同志亲自动手写回忆录的巨大鼓舞和影响下，全省革命回忆录创作运动更迅速地广泛地开展起来了。
    深入开展写作革命回忆录的具体工作，主要要紧紧依靠各级党委。从制定规划、组织力量、搜集材料、拟定提纲、指导写作一直到审稿定稿等整个过程和重要环节，都要在各级党委直接指导下进行。订规划既要自上而下，又要自下而上，上边要提出个要求，但只有通过各级党委提出具体规划和选题，才更实际可靠，执行起来也就能发挥高度积极性。规划定下来以后，就要组织力量，在这期间要进行深入动员，使规划和群众见面，成立专门机构，开办写作训练班等工作。组织力量是一个发动群众的过程，没有广大群众的动员，浩如烟海的革命史实，是无法搜集起来的。江西革命老根据地人民因为热爱过去的革命斗争，所以一谈到要写革命斗争历史，就异常热情地争先恐后地主动提供材料。比如萍矿老工人张竹林和古乐生说：“前人不讲古，后人少了谱。安源事情，毛主席知道，刘主席知道，李立三同志知道，还有我们老工人知道。毛主席、刘主席管理国家大事工作很忙，我们再不把它回忆出来，以后就会失传了。”重点发动的对象应当是老干部、老工人、革命老同志和文艺工作者。		三
    江西在革命回忆录的写作方面，虽然已经有了不少收获，也还面临着不断提高质量的问题。我在上面已经谈到过，我国革命历史的光荣道路，是长期而曲折的；真实的革命故事，是浩如烟海的；老干部们的革命经历，也是非常丰富的。因此，如何把这些深刻地记录了我们的革命历史、生动地反映了我国革命人民英雄主义的精神面貌的真实事迹留存下来，这是需要进一步研究的问题。我以为，一部完整的回忆录作品，在思想内容上必须鲜明地体现毛泽东思想，正确地表述党的方针政策，真实生动地描绘党与群众的血肉关系，如此才能给人以巨大的思想鼓舞力量。我以为，在大搞群众运动的同时，还必须加强领导和组织研究工作，使得整个革命回忆录的写作，都能像《星火燎原》、《红色风暴》、《红色赣粤边》、《艰难的岁月》那样有组织有计划地进行，全面地、生动地反映我们革命历史每一阶段的真实面貌，表现出时代全局的真实，革命向前发展的真实，照耀我们现在和未来的前进道路，这样做，就更能增强革命回忆录的教育效果。同时，更好地进行艺术加工，对回忆录作品来说也是很重要的。整理者加工时应当着重在选择材料、安排情节、润饰文字等方面多下功夫。而这也只有在深刻体会思想内容的情况下，才能做得好。毛主席说：“人类的社会生活虽是文学艺术的唯一源泉，虽是较之后者有不可比拟的生动丰富的内容，但是人民还是不满足于前者而要求后者。这是为什么呢？因为虽然两者都是美，但是文艺作品中反映出来的生活却可以而且应该比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性。”但是没有原料或半制品，就无从加工，所以要把加工过程和研究过程结合起来。研究什么？研究老干部所叙述的时代的群众斗争形式，群众生活形式，群众的语言，这样才是从工农兵群众出发的提高，才是沿着工农兵的方向的提高，才是群众所需要的提高。提高就是要更好地向群众学习，向群众生活学习。回忆录作品创作加工的提高，就是向老干部学习，就是认真研究老干部的一切生活斗争材料，然后才有可能写出思想性艺术性较高的东西来。我们有些作者，很想写出关于革命历史题材的长篇小说，那么好，如果认真研究一切有关革命史料，认真阅读研究大量的回忆录作品，亲自动手协助老干部整理革命斗争回忆录并认真向老干部学习，并长期深入群众斗争生活，彻底改造世界观，我们相信关于历史题材的长篇优秀作品，一定可以创作很多。应当说，现在写一部作品，比起过去要容易些。过去没有什么群众文艺创作运动，现在有大量的群众文艺作品，供给我们好的营养，问题是要认真学习，认真投入斗争。但同时又要看到现在因为群众的作品多了，群众要求也就严格了，群众要求看比他们自己作品更高的东西，由此要做一个自己的作品对群众有巨大影响的革命作家，必须以新的更高的要求来对待自己，这样就要做更艰苦的努力，轻便之路是没有的。
    为了提高回忆录作品的质量，还得加强研究评论工作。这里需要群众评论，专家评论，还需要老干部评论。老干部号召，老干部写作，老干部评论，这对回忆录创作运动开展和提高作品质量都是一个中心问题。
    我们希望更多的老干部参加回忆录作品的评论工作，也希望更多的文艺评论家更多地关怀回忆录作品，更多地写出好的评论文章来。让我们大家共同努力，推动革命回忆录创作运动进一步的发展，为写出更多更好的表现英雄时代的史诗而努力！
