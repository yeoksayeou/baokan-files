Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 18th: In 1960, the output value of the Polish chemical industry will increase by 14.1% compared with 1959, and labor productivity will increase by 13%.

This year, the Polish chemical industry will produce approximately 350 new products. Organic chemical products will increase by more than 20%, plastics production will increase by 80%, and man-made fiber production will reach 4,500 tons. Due to the expansion of pest and disease control in agriculture, Poland will expand pesticide production this year.

Coke chemistry is one of the fastest-growing industries in Poland. In the first half of this year, coke chemical enterprises produced approximately six million tons of coke, equivalent to three times the annual output before liberation. Poland has become the fifth largest coke producer in the world.

Before liberation, Polish agriculture could only obtain about 40,000 tons of chemical fertilizers annually, while in 1959 it was 250,000 tons. In the coming years, Poland will expand some existing chemical fertilizer plants and build a nitrogen fertilizer plant using natural gas as a raw material. By 1969, nitrogen fertilizer production will reach 480,000 tons, and phosphate fertilizer will reach 360,000 tons. Poland now exports chemical products to more than 70 countries. Before liberation, Poland was a country that imported various chemical products. In the first half of this year, Poland's exports of chemical products increased by 20% compared with the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 19th: The average shift output of five of the six major coal mines in Romania's Jiu Valley has now increased to 1,000 to 1,269 kilograms.

This is a new achievement made by Romanian coal miners in the socialist labor emulation campaign. As a result of their competition in the first half of this year, the national average shift output has been increased from the planned 848 kilograms to 857 kilograms, while saving 15 million lei (Romanian currency), and over-fulfilling the plan by 19,000 tons of coking coal.

The content of the miners' socialist emulation is diverse. The slogan of the miners of the Aninoasa coal mine is "Strive to become the best production team among similar trades." Miners in Leopolda proposed a competition to save pit props, proposing the goal of "producing with saved pit props for at least one week per month."

These competitive slogans have been echoed by many production teams. As a result, work efficiency has been improved, and the consumption of pit props in the entire Jiu Valley coal mining area in the first half of this year has also decreased compared with the same period last year.

An important method of saving pit props is to replace them with reinforced concrete supports. This method can not only reduce production costs, but also improve labor productivity. Due to the use of reinforced concrete supports, the average monthly tunneling speed has been increased to 56 meters. The timber consumption per thousand tons of coal in the Cîmpulung and Comăneşti coal mines decreased by 11.8 cubic meters and 15.3 cubic meters respectively in the first half of this year.

    波兰化学工业发展迅速
    罗马尼亚煤矿工人开展劳动竞赛提高工作效率
    新华社华沙18日电　1960年波兰化学工业的产值将比1959年增加14.1％，劳动生产率将提高13％。
    今年，波兰化学工业将生产大约三百五十多种新产品。有机化学产品将增加20％以上，塑料的生产将增加80％，人造纤维的产量将达四千五百吨。由于农业中防治病虫害工作的开展，今年波兰将扩大农药的生产。
    焦炭化学工业是波兰发展最迅速的工业之一。今年上半年，焦炭化学工业企业共生产了大约六百万吨焦炭，相当于解放前年产量的三倍。在焦炭的生产方面，波兰已经跃居世界第五位。
    解放前，波兰农村每年只能得到大约四万吨化学肥料，而1959年是二十五万吨。在今后几年内，波兰将扩建现有的一些化学肥料厂，并建设一座以天然瓦斯为原料的氮肥工厂。到1969年，氮肥的产量将达四十八万吨，磷肥将达三十六万吨。现在，波兰向七十多个国家输出化学产品。而在解放前，波兰则是一个进口各种化学产品的国家。今年上半年，波兰输出的化学产品比去年同时期增加了20％。
    新华社布加勒斯特19日电　罗马尼亚纪乌河谷六大煤矿中有五个煤矿的平均班产量现在已经提高到一千至一千二百六十九公斤。
    这是罗马尼亚煤矿工人在社会主义劳动竞赛中取得的新成就。他们今年上半年竞赛的结果，已将全国平均班产量由原计划的八百四十八公斤提高到八百五十七公斤，同时还节约了一千五百万列伊（罗币），并且超计划开采了一万九千吨炼焦煤。
    矿工们的社会主义竞赛内容是多种多样的。阿尼诺阿萨煤矿工人的竞赛口号是“争取成为同工种生产队中最好的生产队”。莱奥普达矿工们则倡议竞赛节约坑木，提出“每月至少有一个星期用节约下来的坑木进行生产”的指标。
    这些竞赛口号都得到很多生产队的响应。因而工作效率提高了，整个纪乌河谷煤矿区今年上半年的坑木消耗量也比去年同期减少了。
    节约坑木的一个重要方法是用钢筋水泥支架代替坑木。这种办法既可以降低生产成本，又可以提高劳动生产率。由于采用钢筋水泥支架，已将平均每月掘进速度提高到五十六米，钦普隆和可门也什梯煤矿今年上半年每千吨煤的木材消耗量分别减少了十一点八立方米和十五点三立方米。
