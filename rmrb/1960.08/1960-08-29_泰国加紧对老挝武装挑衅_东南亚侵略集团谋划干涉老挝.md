Xinhua News Agency, August 28th dispatch from Bangkok: Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism and the planning of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization aggression bloc, the Thai government is intensifying armed provocations against Laos, creating pretexts for interfering in its internal affairs.

On August 26th, the Thai government issued a statement inverting black and white regarding the provocative shooting by Thai gunboats at Lao warships on the Mekong River, falsely accusing the Lao government of "provocation," and threatening that if Laos "continues to take illegal and provocative actions" against Thailand, the Thai government will "take appropriate action to retaliate," and declaring that Thailand "will not be responsible for any consequences" of such actions.

As previously reported, the Lao Prime Minister's Office issued a communiqué on August 26th stating that at 9:00 AM on August 25th, two Thai gunboats sailed from the opposite bank of the Mekong River and fired on Lao gunboats docked at Kenang. The Lao gunboats were forced to return fire.

According to a dispatch from Saigon by United Press International, when discussing this gunpowder-filled statement from the Thai government, it said that "it seems that Thailand may get involved," thus making the Lao situation an "international problem."

The news agency said that although Laos is not a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, if Thailand is "involved" in the Lao situation, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization would naturally "be drawn in" "due to treaty obligations."

The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization aggression bloc, which is currently holding a "routine meeting" in Bangkok, is secretly plotting conspiracies to intervene in Laos. The meeting is attended by the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to Thailand and diplomatic representatives from other member states of this aggression bloc stationed in Bangkok. United Press International said, "All those attending the meeting are tight-lipped, although it is believed that this secret meeting will definitely discuss the Lao situation."

According to the Thai "Bangkok World" on August 26th, "Thai military officials unanimously believe that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization should immediately hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in Laos." The newspaper said that the recommendation to hold an emergency meeting will soon be submitted to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The newspaper revealed that the conspiracy to interfere in the Lao situation will be carried out under the guise of so-called "Communist activities."

At the same time, the pro-American traitorous clique in Laos is stepping up collusion with Thailand, plotting to subvert the coup. According to the "Bangkok Post" on August 26th, Phoui Sananikone's former Foreign Minister Panya arrived in Bangkok and met with Thai Acting Foreign Minister Charoonchai on August 26th.

    泰国加紧对老挝武装挑衅
    东南亚侵略集团谋划干涉老挝
    新华社28日讯　曼谷消息：在美帝国主义唆使和东南亚条约侵略集团策划下，泰国政府加紧向老挝进行武装挑衅，制造干涉内政的借口。
    泰国政府26日就泰国炮艇在湄公河向老挝军舰进行挑衅性的射击一事发表了一项颠倒黑白的声明，反诬老挝政府“挑衅”，并且威胁说，如果老挝对泰国“继续采取非法的和挑衅性的行动”，泰国政府将“采取适当行动进行报复”，并声言，泰国对这种行动“将不负任何责任”。
    前已报道，老挝首相府26日曾发表公报说，8月25日九点钟，有两艘泰国炮艇从湄公河对岸驶来并向停泊在肯囊的老挝炮艇射击。老挝炮艇曾被迫予以还击。
    据合众国际社自西贡发出的一则消息谈到泰国政府这个充满火药气味的声明时说，“看来泰国也许会卷入”，从而使老挝局势成为一个“国际问题”。
    这家通讯社说，虽然老挝不是东南亚条约组织成员国，但是如果泰国一旦“卷入”老挝局势，“由于条约义务”，东南亚条约组织将会自然而然地“被卷进去”。
    目前正在曼谷举行“例会”的东南亚条约侵略集团正在秘密策划干涉老挝的阴谋。这次会议有美国驻泰国大使馆临时代办和这个侵略集团的其他成员国驻曼谷的外交代表参加。合众国际社说，“所有参加会议的人都守口如瓶，虽然人们认为这次秘密会议肯定会谈论老挝局势问题。”
    据泰国“曼谷世界报”26日说，“泰国的军事官员们一致认为，东南亚条约组织应该立即举行一次紧急会议来讨论老挝的局势。”报纸说，这项要求举行一次紧急会议的建议不久将向泰国外交部提出。
    这家报纸透露，策划干涉老挝局势的阴谋将在所谓“共产党人活动”的幌子下进行。
    同时，老挝亲美卖国集团正加紧和泰国勾结，阴谋推翻政变。据“曼谷邮报”26日报道，前松萨尼特政府外交大臣班雅到达曼谷，并且在26日同泰国代理外交部长乍龙猜举行了会晤。
