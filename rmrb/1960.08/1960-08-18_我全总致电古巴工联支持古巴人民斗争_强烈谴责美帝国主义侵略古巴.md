Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) sent a telegram to the Cuban Workers' Confederation, supporting the Cuban people's struggle against US imperialist intervention through the Organization of American States (OAS) Foreign Ministers' Meeting. The telegram stated that Chinese workers strongly condemn all conspiratorial activities of US imperialism, through the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of the Organization of American States it manipulates, attempting to launch international intervention against Cuba. US imperialism has consistently interfered in the internal affairs of Latin American countries through unilateral actions and the use of the OAS, persisting in a policy of hostility towards Cuba and the Latin American people, fully demonstrating that it is the chief culprit threatening the independence and sovereignty of Latin American countries and the mortal enemy of the people of Latin America and the world.

The people of Latin America and the people of the world will resolutely prevent the recurrence of the US imperialist-engineered overthrow of Guatemala. Chinese workers and the people reiterate their firm support for the just struggle of the heroic Cuban people against US imperialist aggression and in defense of national sovereignty. We are deeply convinced that, with the increasingly broad support of the people of Latin America and the world, the Cuban people will surely be able to crush US imperialist aggression and intervention activities and continue to achieve victory.

    强烈谴责美帝国主义侵略古巴
    新华社17日讯　中华全国总工会致电古巴工联，支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义通过美洲国家组织外长会议进行干涉的斗争。电文说，中国工人强烈谴责美帝国主义通过它所操纵的美洲国家组织外长会议，企图发动对古巴进行国际干涉的一切阴谋活动。美帝国主义一贯通过单方面行动和利用美洲国家组织，干涉拉丁美洲各国内政，坚持与古巴和拉丁美洲人民为敌的政策，充分证明了它是威胁拉丁美洲各国独立与主权完整的罪魁祸首，是拉丁美洲和全世界各国人民的死敌。
    拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民将坚决制止美帝国主义策动颠复危地马拉事件的重演。中国工人和人民重申坚决支持英勇的古巴人民反对美帝国主义侵略、维护国家主权的正义斗争。我们深信，在拉丁美洲和全世界人民日益广泛的支持下，古巴人民一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的侵略和干涉活动，不断取得胜利。
