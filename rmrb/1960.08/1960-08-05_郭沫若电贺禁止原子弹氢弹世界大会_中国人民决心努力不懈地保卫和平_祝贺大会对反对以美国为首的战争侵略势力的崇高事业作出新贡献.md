Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, today sent a telegram to Yasui Kaoru, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and forwarded it to the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament, warmly congratulating the convening of the conference.

The telegram said that on the occasion of the victorious arrival of the Japanese people's 10,000-kilometer peace march at its destination and the holding of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament in Tokyo, the China Peace Committee and I myself would like to express our warm congratulations and high respect to the Japanese people who have persistently and valiantly struggled against nuclear weapons, against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and extend our sincere greetings to the delegates from various countries attending the conference.

The telegram said that the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy for a new war and against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty has achieved great success, dealing a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its agents in Japan, powerfully inspiring the people of all countries in the world to fight against imperialism, and making brilliant contributions to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world. The Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament is being held under the excellent situation of an unprecedented upsurge in the movement of the Japanese people and the people of all countries in the world against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace, which is of great significance. We believe that this conference, on the basis of the achievements of the past five conferences, will further strengthen the unity of the Japanese people, strengthen the unity with the people of all countries in the world, and make new and greater contributions to the noble cause of the people of all countries against nuclear weapons and against the imperialist war and aggression forces headed by the United States.

The telegram said that the Chinese people have always advocated peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems on the basis of the Five Principles. We resolutely support the just struggle against colonialism and for the maintenance of national independence. We resolutely oppose the threat of a new war and resolutely demand the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, the realization of general disarmament, and the removal of foreign military bases, making unremitting efforts to defend world peace. The Chinese people will always join hands with the Japanese people and the people of all countries in the world in this great common struggle, marching forward and striving for final victory. We wish the conference success. (Attached picture)
