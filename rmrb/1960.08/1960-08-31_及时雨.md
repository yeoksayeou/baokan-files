    "Timely Rain"
    Hubei Xishui, Li Erbo
    Wherever there is drought resistance, go there; wherever tools need repairing, go there to repair them! Workers from the farm tool factory in the Bahe Management District of the Bahe Commune in Xishui County, carrying their red-hot furnaces, walked out of the factory gates to repair drought resistance tools at the forefront of the fight against drought. They were warmly welcomed by the commune members, who called them "timely rain."
    Indeed, the growth of crops cannot be separated from the nourishment of rain and dew. If the sky does not rain, we will roll up our sleeves and move the water from reservoirs, rivers, lakes, and ponds to the fields. This is the "timely rain" created by the commune members of the people's commune under the leadership of the Party with their own hands.
    In terms of the overall high-speed development of agriculture, it cannot be separated from the support of industry. After the Party called on all walks of life to support agriculture, all aspects extended a helping hand to agriculture. These are all "rain and dew" that promote the high-speed development of agriculture. The commendable thing about the workers of the Bahe Farm Tool Factory is that they are doing agriculture's "rain and dew" and doing it "timely." Timely means seizing time and seizing the season. Agriculture has a strong seasonality, and the fight against disasters is even more a race against time. Winning time means grain, means victory.
    This practice of the Bahe Farm Tool Factory reflects their serious listening to the Party's words and sincere service to agriculture. Therefore, they overcome difficulties, are not afraid of hardship, and turned "waiting for customers to come to the door" into "delivering services to the door," giving convenience to the peasants as much as possible, and delivering "service" to the fields.
    Going to the fields for repairs is by no means a trivial matter. Drought resistance is as urgent as a burning fire. If a machine that is pumping water stops running due to damage, sending it for repair, a round trip, waiting, will delay time, which will affect timely irrigation, and the loss will be grain, will be cotton. Tools inevitably need frequent maintenance during use. The number of mechanized and semi-mechanized new tools for equipping agriculture is increasing, which requires strengthening the force of tool maintenance and the need for "timely rain" like the Bahe Farm Tool Factory. Lush seedlings, receiving "timely" irrigation of "rain and dew," will grow stronger and achieve greater harvests.

### “及时雨”

    “及时雨”
    湖北浠水　李尔波
    哪里抗旱，就到哪里去；哪里需要修整工具，就到哪里去修整！浠水县巴河公社巴河管理区农具厂的工人，担上红炉，走出厂门，到抗旱前线去修整抗旱工具，受到社员的热烈欢迎，把他们叫做“及时雨”。
    的确，农作物的生长，离不开雨露的滋润。天不下雨，我们就卷起袖管，把水库、江河、湖塘里的水，搬到田里去。这是党领导下的人民公社社员双手造就的“及时雨”。
    就整个农业高速度发展来说，离不开工业的支援。党号召各行各业都来支援农业以后，各方面向农业伸出了援助的手。这都是促进农业高速度发展的“雨露”。巴河农具厂工人的可贵处，就在于做农业的“雨露”而又“及时”。及时，就是争时间，抢季节。农业的季节性很强，抗灾斗争更是分秒必争。争得时间，就是粮食，就是胜利。
    巴河农具厂的这种做法，反映了他们认真听党的话，诚心诚意为农业服务的思想，因而排除困难，不怕艰苦，把“等上门”变成了“送上门”，把方便尽量让给农民，把“服务”送到田间去。
    到田间去，修修整整，决不是小事情。抗旱急如星火，如果正在抽水的一台机械，因损坏停止了转动，送去修理，来回一跑，一等，耽误时间，也就影响了及时灌溉，损失的是粮食，是棉花。工具在使用过程中，必然要经常维修。装备农业的机械化、半机械化新工具越来越多，越需要加强工具维修的力量，越需要像巴河农具厂那样的“及时雨”。茂盛的禾苗，得到“雨露”的“及时”浇灌，将会生长得更加茁壮，获得更大丰收。
