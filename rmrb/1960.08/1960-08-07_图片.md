    The 15,000 mu of multi-eared sorghum in the Rongxiang People's Commune, Changli County, Hebei Province, is growing better than in previous years due to increased fertilization and diligent pest control, with tasseling occurring about half a month earlier than last year. The picture shows commune members spraying pesticides in the sorghum fields to kill pests.
