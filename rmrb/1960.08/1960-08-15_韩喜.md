    Han Xi

    Starting from the Dispatch Meeting
    Some time ago, Zhou Yuanshan, the newly appointed deputy manager of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's Fifth Engineering Company, presided over the dispatch meeting. He was troubled by the fact that problems were always unclear and the dispatch meeting was not well presided over. The dispatchers said: "The dispatch meeting presided over by Deputy Manager Han is short, but many problems are solved." How is this done? Zhou Yuanshan went to ask Han Xi, a member of the company's Party committee and deputy manager, for advice.
  Han Xi said modestly: "Actually, there is nothing special about it. As long as you stick to the front line and directly grasp first-hand information, you can solve most of the problems."
    One of Han Xi's characteristics is that he works hard and goes deep into the field to grasp a large amount of first-hand information. People can often see this thin middle-aged man wearing a broken straw hat and a work uniform working on the construction site, finding out the situation on the construction site. Usually, it is difficult to find him at his desk. People say that his pocket is his desk, and a pen and a notebook are his office supplies.
    At a dispatch meeting in May, Cai Genfa, the director of the Second Construction Site, who was in charge of the heating furnace project in the primary rolling mill, proposed: There is not enough labor for digging and filling soil, and more people need to be added. Han Xi said: "Go back and adjust the existing labor force!" Cai Genfa said embarrassedly: "It can't be adjusted!" Han Xi said: "Then why do you have so many people transporting bricks?" Cai Genfa was stunned: "You know this too?" It turned out that Han Xi, in addition to often going deep into the field, also had a habit of going to the construction site to find out the situation before each dispatch meeting. Before this dispatch meeting, he saw six workers laying bricks on the second construction site, but there were sparsely arranged auxiliary workers in a long line, passing bricks. He roughly counted and found that there were more than forty people. Han Xi thought at the time: Although the distance is long and the efficiency of bricklaying is high, more people are needed to transport bricks; however, if the working methods are improved, labor can still be greatly saved. When Han Xi presented this situation, Cai Genfa had nothing to say, and immediately promoted advanced tools, improved the method of transporting bricks, and adjusted the labor force to engage in digging and filling soil, and no labor force was added to the construction site.
    In the Ditch
    Han Xi goes wherever there are difficulties, and insists on working with the workers, discovering problems and solving problems during labor.
    In July this year, the flushing ditch project of Wuhan Iron and Steel's large rolling mill was under intense construction. This is a large ditch leading to the plate mill, 120 meters long and more than 14 meters deep. It is necessary to dig out sludge, tie steel bars, support formwork, and pour concrete. The task is heavy, but the construction period is only five days. When Han Xi and the workers and technicians were discussing how to complete the task, some people said that they were afraid that it would not be completed on time.
    The next afternoon, Han Xi put on long rubber boots, changed into work clothes, and went down to the flushing ditch to work while finding out the situation and solving problems.
    As soon as he got into the ditch, he saw that the entrance of the ditch was blocked by messy things such as wood and nails, and the workers could not stand upright when they went in and out. He immediately picked up an iron shovel and led the workers to clean up the messy things at the entrance of the ditch, so that everyone could stand upright to enter and exit. Then, he stepped on more than a foot of silt and went into the ditch. The further he went, the darker the light became, because the electric light inside was broken. He thought: "How can the workers work well like this?" He immediately went out to find the electrician and repaired the electric light. In an instant, the ditch was brightly lit, and the workers were all energetic, talking and laughing. He worked with the workers for a while, and when he rested, he found that there was no water to drink at the construction site. He quickly went to the canteen cooks to carry two buckets of water, and told the canteen负责人 that: "In the future, wherever the workers are working, the water should be delivered there to ensure that the workers have water to drink at any time!" The workers saw that their deputy manager solved many specific problems in the labor, and they were very happy, and they were full of energy when they worked.
    On this day, Han Xi worked with the workers until the end of work. After the workers left, he went to the construction site director to study the construction method of implementing assembly line operations in the ditch. Xie Wenjun, the general branch secretary of this construction site, also led the cadres to work in the ditch, understanding and solving problems on the spot. As a result, this project was completed two days ahead of schedule.
    The Story of the Caisson
    Han Xi insists on being on the front line, often discussing matters with the masses, and relying on veteran workers to solve many technical problems with a combination of local and foreign methods, so that the project can be built quickly, well, and economically.
    When the project of building the ore car pit of No. 1 blast furnace was underway, the Party committee decided to adopt the construction method of caissons. As for how the caisson should sink, the Party committee did not specify. Han Xi considered: If the old method is followed, digging soil from all around, the working surface will become smaller and smaller, people will be idle, and the caisson cannot sink more than 30 centimeters each time, which will take 45 days to complete. How can the construction period be shortened? Is there any other good way? He went to discuss with veteran workers Liu Beihai, Yi Lixiang, etc. The veteran workers suggested: Can we dig soil from the middle? This opinion was very enlightening to Han Xi. He felt that this made sense: taking soil from the middle, the working surface gradually increases, and the surrounding soil loosens faster, and the sinking speed of the caisson will definitely be accelerated. However, this method breaks the old specifications, is the geological condition feasible? He went to seek the opinion of the engineer. The engineer said: "The geology here is very good, it is high-phosphorus soil, the pressure is high, and the method of taking soil from the middle can be adopted." He also asked veteran workers who had engaged in caisson construction in Northeast China, and they also said that the geology here could work. He also specifically calculated the pressure of the soil in Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, and then reported the new method of sinking the caisson by taking soil from the middle to the Party committee. After careful study, the Party committee agreed to construct according to this method.
    However, the volume of the caisson is very large, and it must be kept balanced to ensure the quality of the project. According to the opinions of some technicians, a U-shaped glass tube measuring level is necessary. This kind of level was not available for a while, and it could not be bought. What should I do? He went to consult the old carpenter. Old carpenter Yi Lixiang said: "If you don't have that foreign thing, we can make a local one. According to the method of making wooden work plumb bobs, just draw two center lines on the caisson, and hanging four plumb bobs on four heads will definitely work." This local method turned out to be very good. As long as the workers saw which side of the plumb line was skewed, they would loosen the soil on the other side to correct it, and then keep the caisson sinking in balance. In this way, the progress of each sinking of the caisson was accelerated from 30 centimeters to 70 centimeters. They completed the project that was originally planned to be completed in 45 days in 12 days, and the quality fully met the requirements.
    The Confidant of the Masses
    Han Xi not only goes deep into the front line to solve construction problems, but also goes deep into the front line to solve the workers' living problems. After the No. 2 blast furnace started baking, the leaders found that the wood baking furnace was not hot enough, and decided to change to tying steel bars and using electric baking furnaces. In order to save time, the workers were anxious to drill into the furnace to tie steel bars before the furnace cooled down. Han Xi, who had been living on the scene, thought at the time that although the furnace had been opened for a day, it had been baked for a day, and the temperature inside the furnace must still be high. Wouldn't it be too hot for the workers to drill in? He was in a meeting, so he asked dispatcher Ma Yongfu to find out. Ma Yongfu looked at the furnace and reported back: "The workers have already started working in the furnace! It looks quite hot inside." At this time, the meeting had just ended, and it was already after 12 o'clock in the middle of the night. Han Xi felt that his report did not solve the problem, so he immediately put on his safety helmet and said, "Let's go and see again!" Ma Yongfu and he went to the furnace for the second time. When they arrived at the furnace, they saw Han Xi bend over and drill into the furnace. He felt that it was steamy inside, so he immediately asked Ma Yongfu to lead dozens of pounds of soda and iced plum soup to the ironmaking plant for the workers to drink; at the same time, he organized the workers to take turns entering the furnace to operate, changing shifts every two hours.
    Han Xi has been sticking to the front line like this for seven years since he was transferred from the army to the basic construction front in 1953. He is completely integrated with the workers. When he was the director of the Third Construction Site, he could name all the more than 300 workers on the construction site, understand their tempers and thoughts, and know their residences and housework. After he became the deputy manager of the company, he could name all the 700 veteran workers in the company, know their characteristics, and remember what happened in their families. The workers call their Manager Han "the confidant of the masses."
    Under the leadership of the Party, the Fifth Company and other companies have successfully completed a series of major construction tasks such as the No. 3 and No. 4 pumping stations of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation and the No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces. The Third Construction Site he originally led has been repeatedly rated as an advanced unit in Hubei Province and Wuhan City. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on cadres on the industrial and transportation front in the province to learn his excellent work style. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently made a special decision to promote his leadership experience. (Attached picture)

    从调度会说起
    前些时，武钢第五工程公司新任的副经理周元山主持调度会议，他为问题总是扯不清、调度会议主持不好很苦闷。调度员们说：“韩副经理主持的调度会，会开得短，问题却解决得很多。”这是怎么搞的呢？周元山去请教公司的党委委员、副经理韩喜。
  韩喜谦虚地说：“其实也没有什么，只要坚持在第一线，直接掌握第一手材料，就能解决一大半问题。”
    韩喜的特点之一，就是艰苦深入，掌握大量第一手材料。人们经常可以看见这位瘦瘦的中年人，戴着一顶破了边的草帽，穿着一身工作服在工地劳动，在工地摸情况。平时，人们很难在他的办公桌旁找到他。人们说他那随身的口袋就是办公桌，一支笔、一个本子就是办公用具。
    5月的一次调度会议。承担初轧厂均热炉工程的二工地主任蔡根发提出：挖土、填土的劳动力不够，再补充些人才行。韩喜说：“回去好好调整一下现有劳动力吧！”蔡根发为难地说：“调整不出来啦！”韩喜说：“那你们运砖搞那么多人干什么呢？”蔡根发一怔：“这情况你也知道？”原来，韩喜除了经常深入现场以外，还有个习惯，就是在每次调度会前，必定再到工地摸摸情况。这次调度会以前，他在工地看见二工地六个工人砌砖，却稀疏疏地排着一长队辅助工，在传递砖头。粗点了一下数，竟有四十多个人。韩喜当时想：虽然距离长，砌砖效率高，运砖的人是要多些；但是，把工作方法改进一下，还是可以大大节省劳动力的。韩喜把这情况一摆出来，蔡根发再没有什么话可说，回去马上推广先进工具，改进运砖方法，调整出劳动力搞挖土、填土，工地上一个劳动力也没有增加。
    在地沟里
    韩喜是哪里困难就到哪里去，并且坚持和工人同劳动，在劳动中随时发现问题，解决问题。
    今年7月，武钢大型轧钢厂的冲洗沟工程在紧张施工。这是一条通往轧板厂的大沟，有一百二十米长，十四多米深，要挖掉污泥，扎钢筋，支模板，打混凝土等，任务很大，但工期只有五天。韩喜和工人、技术人员研究怎样完成任务的时候，有的人说，怕不能按时完成。
    第二天下午，韩喜就穿上长统胶鞋，换上工作服，下冲洗沟去边劳动边摸情况，边解决问题。
    一下沟，他便看见沟门给木料、钉子等杂乱的东西堵住了，工人们出出进进都直不起腰来。他马上拿起一把铁锹，带动工人把沟门的杂乱东西清理利索，使大家能直起腰来进出了。接着，他踏着一尺多深的淤泥进沟里去。越走光线越暗，原来里边的电灯坏了。他心想：“这样，工人怎么好干活呢？”他马上出去把电工找来，修好了电灯。霎时，沟里大放光明，工人们个个精神抖擞，有说有笑。他和工人们干了一阵活，休息的时候，又发现施工的地方没有水喝。他连忙去找食堂炊事人员挑来了两桶水，并且告诉食堂负责人说：“以后，工人在哪里劳动，应该把水送到哪里去，要保证工人随时有水喝呀！”工人们看见他们的副经理在劳动中解决了许多具体问题，心里非常高兴，干起活来劲头十足。
    这天，韩喜和工人一起一直劳动到下工的时间。工人走了以后，他又到工地主任那里研究了在沟下实行流水作业的施工方法。这个工地的总支书记谢文俊也领着干部下沟劳动，在现场了解和解决问题。结果，这项工程竟提前两天就完成了。
    下沉箱的故事
    韩喜坚持在第一线，有事经常同群众商量，依靠老工人用土洋结合的办法解决了许多技术问题，因而使工程建设得又快、又好、又省。
    修建一号高炉料车坑的工程时，党委决定采用沉箱的施工方法。至于沉箱如何下沉，党委没有具体规定。韩喜考虑：如果按照老办法，从四周挖土，越挖工作面越小，人要窝工，而且沉箱每次下沉不能超过三十公分，这得四十五天才能完成。怎样才能缩短工期？还有什么别的好办法？他去找老工人刘北海、衣立祥等商量。老工人们提出：能不能从中间挖土呢？这个意见对韩喜启发很大。他觉得这话有道理：从中间取土，工作面逐渐增大，周围土松得越快，沉箱下沉速度就一定能加快。但是，这个办法打破了老的规范，地质条件行不行呢？他去征求工程师的意见。工程师说：“这里的地质很好，是高磷土，压力大，可以采取从中间取土的办法。”他又去问在东北搞过沉箱施工的老工人，他们也说这里的地质能行。他又具体计算了一下武钢土质的压力，便把沉箱下沉采取中间取土这样一个新的方法，向党委会作了汇报。党委认真研究以后，同意按这个方法施工。
    但是，沉箱的体积很大，要保持平衡下沉，才能保证工程质量。按照一些技术人员的意见，这非要有个Ｕ字形玻璃管的测量水平仪不可。这种水平仪一时找不到，又买不到，怎么办？他便去找老木工商量。老木工衣立祥说：“没有那洋玩意儿，咱们搞个土的，按照作木活吊线锤的办法，就在沉箱上牵两条中心线，四头吊上四个线锤准能行。”这个土办法试用起来果然很好，工人们只要看见哪边的吊线歪斜了，就在另一边松松土加以纠正，便保持了沉箱平衡下沉。这样一来，沉箱每次下沉的进度由三十公分，加快到七十公分，他们十二天便完成了原计划四十五天完成的工程，质量完全合乎要求。
    群众的贴心人
    韩喜不仅深入第一线解决施工问题，还深入第一线解决工人生活问题。二号高炉开始烘炉以后，领导方面发现木头烘炉温度不够，决定改扎钢筋通电气烘炉。工人们为了争取时间，不等炉子凉了，就急着钻进炉里去绑扎钢筋。一直住在现场的韩喜，当时想到炉子虽然已经敞开了一天，但它是烘过一天的，炉子里的温度一定还不低，工人们钻进去是不是太热呢？他正在开会，就让调度员马永福去了解一下。马永福在炉旁看了看，回来说：“工人已经在炉子里干起来啦！里面看样子相当热。”这时，会议刚散，已是深夜十二点多钟。韩喜觉得他这个汇报不解决问题，马上戴上安全帽，说：“走，再瞧瞧去！”马永福跟他二次上炉子去。到了炉子跟前，只见韩喜身子一弯就钻进炉子里了。他觉着里面热气蒸人，立即叫马永福到炼铁厂领了几十磅汽水和冰酸梅汤来，让工人喝；同时将工人组织起来，两个钟头一换班，轮流进炉操作。
    韩喜从1953年由部队转业投入基本建设战线以后，就是这样七年如一日地坚持在第一线。他同工人完全打成一片。他在担任三工地主任时，工地的三百多名工人，他全部叫得出名字，了解他们的脾气和思想情况，知道他们的住处和家务事。他担任公司副经理以后，全公司七百名老工人，他全部叫得出名字，知道他们的特点，记得他们家里发生了什么事情。工人们叫他们的韩经理是“群众的贴心人”。
    在党的领导下，五公司和其他公司一起出色地完成了武钢三、四号水泵站和一、二号高炉等一系列重大的施工任务。他原来领导的三工地，曾经多次被评为湖北省和武汉市的先进单位。中共湖北省委号召全省工业交通战线上的干部学习他的优良的工作作风。中共武汉市委最近又专门作出决定，推广他的领导经验。（附图片）
