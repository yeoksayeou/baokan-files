    [The "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" are People's Liberation Army soldiers stationed on Shanghai's most bustling Nanjing Road. They are a red banner for maintaining and promoting the PLA's fine tradition of hard work and plain living.]
        Sewing Kit
          Wang Dehua
    The sewing kit is an all-purpose treasure,
    Carried by the Eighth Company's soldiers.
    If you ask what it's for,
    It can mend shoes, socks, and clothing.
    Not because we have few shoes and socks,
    Not because we lack clothing,
    Hard work and plain living are family heirlooms,
    We must never forget them.
        Barbershop
        Shen Shoufu
    Our company has a barbershop,
    Neat, clean, and beautiful,
    All kinds of furniture are available,
    Except for the barber.
    Everyone is a guest,
    Everyone is a barber,
    Don't say our skills are lacking,
    Our beauty treatments surpass "Violet". (Note)
        Mending a Washbasin
          Tong Xingen
    Fourth Squad has a Yang Guangpin,
    Sacrificing his nap to mend a washbasin,
    Mending until exactly two o'clock,
    Turning a broken basin into a good one.
    Don't think it's not well-mended,
    This basin has been used for nine whole years.
    Note: "Violet" is a famous barbershop in Shanghai.

    “南京路上好八连”诗选
     〔“南京路上好八连”是驻防在上海市最繁华的南京路上的某部解放军战士，他们是保持和发扬了解放军艰苦朴素的优良传统的一面红旗。〕
        针线包
          王德华
    针线包是万宝囊，
    八连战士带身上。
    你要问他有啥用，
    能缝鞋袜补衣裳。
    不是因咱鞋袜少，
    不是因咱缺衣裳，
    艰苦朴素传家宝，
    咱们永远不能忘。
        理发馆
        沈守福
    咱连有个理发馆，
    整齐清洁又美观，
    各种家具样样有，
    就是没有理发员。
    人人都是座上客，
    人人都当理发员，
    莫说咱这手艺差，
    美容胜过“紫罗兰”。（注）
        补脸盆
          童新根
    四班有个杨光品，
    牺牲午觉补脸盆，
    一直补到两点整，
    破盆变成好脸盆。
    别看补得不大好，
    此盆已用九年整。
    注：“紫罗兰”是上海的一家著名理发馆。
