　　“Resist until there is no water, and if there is no water, resist until water comes.” This is the heroic pledge made by the members of the Shizi Brigade of the Zhuqi Commune in Shaodong County, Hunan Province, in this drought resistance struggle.
　　At the beginning of July, after the brigade had drained all the water from its ponds, dams, wells, canals, reservoirs, and rivers, the threat of drought still had not been eliminated. Therefore, they organized again, crossed mountains and ridges, and transported water from a neighboring brigade more than ten miles away. As a result, the water was exhausted again, and the heavens still did not send rain. But they did not give up. They organized people to look for water everywhere, climbed cliffs and precipices, and entered bottomless caves where even birds and beasts were rarely seen. In a place more than ten miles deep, they finally discovered an underground water source. So, they formed a human chain to carry water, bringing the water out of the deep cave. Water was finally brought forth from nothing.
　　There is the word "resist" in both of these sentences. This "resist" is precisely the spirit of our era. The first half of the sentence, "Resist until there is no water," shows the masses' tenacious fighting spirit in the drought resistance struggle, and also demonstrates their determination to fight the drought to the end. Possessing a soaring ambition and persisting to the end is the true color of heroes throughout the ages. However, the heroic spirit of "Resist until there is no water" is even better than that of the predecessors. Just look at the magnificent slogan "Resist until water comes from nothing." Hasn't it already surpassed some of the bold words of ancient heroes?
　　"Resist until water comes from nothing"—from this sentence, we can see the revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism of the Mao Zedong era.
　　"Having" and "nothing" have always been two opposing concepts. Many people have regarded the gap between them as an absolutely insurmountable chasm. However, the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people, and the revolutionary cause of the people all over the world, have always progressed from nothing to something, and from small to large. The Chinese people in today's Great Leap Forward era have become the masters of society and are gradually becoming the masters of nature. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, armed with Marxism-Leninism and possessing the "Three Magic Weapons," the people have come to realize from their own experiences in revolutionary struggle that "having" and "nothing" are dialectical. They believe that these two originally opposing concepts are not absolutely immutable. Under certain conditions, as long as people's subjective initiative is fully exerted, "having" can be transformed into "nothing," and "nothing" can also be transformed into "having." In this drought resistance struggle, with such an understanding and belief, people fully believed in their own hard work, bravery, and wisdom, made such a magnificent pledge, and dared to do so, and finally achieved the great victory of "resisting until water comes from nothing."

    “有水抗到无水止，无水抗出有水来”。这是湖南邵东县斫?公社十字大队的社员们在这次抗旱斗争中立下的豪迈誓言。
    7月初，这个队将本队所有的塘、坝、井、圳、水库、河道里的水，车干以后，干旱威胁还是没有解除。于是，他们又组织起来，翻越崇山峻岭，把十几里路外的邻队的水车了过来，结果又车完了，老天爷还是没下雨。但是他们并不就此罢休，又组织人四处找水，攀登悬崖绝壁，爬进了鸟兽绝迹的无底岩洞，在深达十余里的地方，终于发现了一股地下水，于是，他们又组成了一条车水的人龙，将水从深深的洞里引了出来。无水终于抗出有水来。
    这两句话里，都有一个“抗”字。这“抗”字正是我们的时代精神。“有水抗到无水止”这前半句，能够看出这里的群众在抗旱斗争中的顽强斗志，也表现了他们誓与旱灾斗争到底的决心。气吞牛斗，坚持到底，是历代英雄本色。然而，“有水抗到无水止”的英雄气概，比起前人来，却是有过之而无不及。且看“无水抗出有水来”这样一句雄壮的口号，不是已经超过了古代英雄的一些豪言壮语了吗？
    “无水抗出有水来”，从这句话里看出了毛泽东时代的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义来。
    “有”和“无”，从来就是两个相对立的概念，多少人曾经把它们两者之间，视为有一条绝对不可逾越的鸿沟。但是，中国人民的革命事业，全世界人民的革命事业，总都是从无到有、从小到大的。处在今天大跃进时代里的中国人民已经成了社会的主人，已经逐渐成为大自然的主宰。在共产党和毛主席的领导下，用马克思列宁主义武装起来并且有了“三大法宝”的人民，已经从革命斗争的切身经历中，认识到“有”和“无”是辩证的。他们相信，这两个本来相对立的概念，不是绝对不变的，在一定的条件下，只要充分发挥人的主观能动作用，“有”就能转化为“无”；而“无”也能够转化为“有”。在这次抗旱斗争中，人们凭着这样一种认识和信念，完全相信自己的勤劳勇敢和智慧，立下了这样的雄壮誓言，并且敢于这样作了，终于取得了“无水抗出有水来”的伟大胜利。
