Hainan Folk Songs

Hainan is a good place
Qinghai Lake water shines with golden light,
Hainan is a good place,
Rare birds and animals are everywhere,
All kinds of treasures are hidden underground;

Highland barley fields stretch as far as the eye can see,
Cattle and sheep are fat and strong all over the mountains.
Herdsmen sing praises of the Party and Chairman Mao
Have you seen the top of the Bayan Har Mountains?
The Communist Party's kindness is higher than it.
Have you seen the rolling waters of the Yellow River?
Chairman Mao's kindness is deeper and longer than it.

From heaven to earth,
We cannot find better words to praise Chairman Mao;
From mountains to the ocean,
We cannot find better gifts to give to the Communist Party.
The red sun rises from the east,
Dear Chairman Mao asks how we are living?
For a moment, we cannot find words to answer,
We can only ask him to look at the red glow on our faces.

The Communist Party's merits are immeasurable,
Chairman Mao is the sun in winter,
I am not praising with empty words,
My conscience makes me sing.

All thanks to the Party's good leadership
In the past, the wasteland was full of wild goats,
Now fertile fields stretch without end;
Grain piles up and fills the granaries,
All thanks to the Party's good leadership.

Infinitely beautiful tomorrow
Pigs are full in the pens and grain fills the granaries,
Cattle, sheep, and mules and horses cover the mountains;
Thousands of miles of farmland are cultivated by machines,
Railways are built into spiderwebs;
Factory chimneys are like forests,
Green trees are like oceans;
Everyone praises the commune's goodness,
Happy life lasts for ten thousand years.

### 海南民歌

    海南民歌海南是个好地方青海湖水闪金光，海南是个好地方，珍禽异兽到处有，各种宝贝地下藏；青稞麦田望无边，牛羊肥壮满山岗。牧民歌唱党和毛主席你见过巴颜喀拉山的山顶吗？共产党的恩情比它还高。你见过黄河的滚滚流水吗？毛主席的恩情比它更深更长。从天上到地下，找不出更好的话来把毛主席赞扬；从高山到海洋，找不出更好的礼物送给共产党。红红的太阳从东方升起，亲爱的毛主席问我们生活得怎样？我们一时想不出话来回答，只好请他看看我们脸上的红光。共产党功德无量，毛主席是冬天的太阳，我不是空口赞扬，良心要我歌唱。全靠党的好领导过去荒滩遍地是野羊，现在肥沃良田无边望；粮食成堆囤满仓，全靠党的好领导。无限美好的明天猪满圈来粮满仓，牛羊骡马遍山岗；千里农田机器耕，铁路修成蜘蛛网；工厂烟囱像森林，绿色树木似海洋；人人争夸公社好，幸福生活万年长。
