    People's Commune Family
    By our reporter Chen Jian
    I found Wang Yumei's home in a very clean worker residential area, but she wasn't there. I visited her again at dinner time and ran into Wang Yumei's mother-in-law returning from the canteen with food. I said I had already been there. She smiled apologetically and said, "The whole family has become workers! I am a nanny at the commune's nursery, Yumei is a worker at the commune's alcohol factory, my son Wang Qinghe is a cook at the factory, and my two grandsons go to the nursery early in the morning. Unless it's Sunday or mealtime, you won't find anyone at home."
    The old lady had just arranged a few cooked dishes, some flatbread, and steamed buns when Yumei returned. That evening, I was also a guest of this family. In addition to warmly taking care of the guest, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law would secretly put good food into each other's bowls from time to time. Looking at their intimacy, one can imagine what a harmonious and amicable family this is! While eating, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law told me many things about their family.
    Wang Qinghe, who was on leave studying at the workers' cultural school, also returned at this time, with a roll of homework under his arm. I asked to see his notebook, and on the first page, I saw the title: "Changes in my family after communization." What changed? Let's take a look at Wang Qinghe's composition.

        The People's Commune Brings a Harmonious Family

    This family has found true happiness, harmony, amity, and relatively affluent living conditions in the urban people's commune. But it has an extremely bumpy past. Before liberation, Wang Qinghe's mother took her son begging all year round. Wang Yumei was not yet a daughter-in-law in this family at that time. Her "fate" was even worse than that of the mother and son. She was a child bride at a very young age and was resold several times after she grew up a little. After liberation, she jumped out of the sea of ​​suffering and married Wang Qinghe, a cook at the textile machinery factory. Logically speaking, these people with similar experiences should be very happy when they form a family, but it was not the case. Although they all knew that life after liberation was much better than in the past, they still had new troubles and new contradictions. Wang Yumei's past life of hardship did not destroy her strong body. She had all the energy to work, but she soon had two children and was held back by housework. What about the mother-in-law? She had always regarded her daughter-in-law with feudal traditional moral concepts, and looked down on her because she was a married woman. What about Wang Qinghe? One person's salary was used to support a family of five, which was a bit tight, and he needed to borrow money from his neighbors at the end of each month; at this time, there were more family problems. At that time, as soon as Wang Qinghe entered the house, the old lady would either complain that Yumei had cooked too much or too little rice, or that it was too thin or too thick. In short, everything was unpleasant. Although Wang Qinghe was already a Communist Party member at that time, he couldn't do anything about such family disputes.

    What is the fundamental solution to the problem? Wang Qinghe's composition reads: "The urban people's commune brought me a harmonious and happy family."

        Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law Reconciled

    In September 1958, the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory People's Commune was born. Wang Yumei sent her children to the nursery, took the lead in eating at the canteen, and was among the first to participate in the commune-run factory. In the early days of the commune's establishment, there were many meetings, busy work, poor conditions, and everything was starting from scratch. Wang Yumei went all out for everything without considering gains or losses. She liked to listen to the principles of thoroughly liberating women more than others. When the mother-in-law saw that her daughter-in-law had changed, she often had a smile on her face and was more kind to her than in the past. She was very moved and followed a few old ladies to register at the commune's nursery.
    One night, the family gathered together and talked late into the night. Yumei said: "Mom, in the past, the two of us were confined at home, turning around in front of the pot and behind the pot, from inside the house to outside the house. We didn't attend meetings or listen to reports. Not to mention national affairs, we didn't even understand what was going on in our factory. Plus, I didn't have a job, so I would argue over trivial matters. I wasn't respectful to you, and the home became an ice cellar..." The old lady said: "I'm wrong, I have an old mind." Wang Qinghe was shocked by the sudden change in the ideological feelings of the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and didn't know what to say. For many years, he had been looking forward to this day, when everyone in the family would have a job, love each other, and get along harmoniously, and the living conditions would therefore be improved. Now that the ideal has become a reality, he looked at his mother, then at his wife, and finally said: "Chairman Mao has pointed out the way for us, and we must follow it well. We didn't manage our family well in the past, but we must become a model family in the future."
    This family has completely changed. For more than a year, the three of them have not been absent from work and have not quarreled. They care for each other, understand each other, and help each other. On Sundays, the whole family of five goes to the movies together. Yumei and Wang Qinghe go to night school to study in the evening, and the old lady also studies several times a week. Wang Qinghe has been promoted to director of the large canteen that feeds more than 5,000 people because of his rapid progress in the past year, and is now on leave studying junior high school cultural courses; Wang Yumei is also a model in her studies and has entered an amateur senior primary school and is now the leader of a group in the commune's alcohol factory. This family is not only harmonious, but also started saving money this year. Sometimes, it is very interesting to listen to the conversations of the members of this family when they meet. Wang Yumei has a small diary with her, in which she records her leap forward plans and ways to overcome shortcomings. Wang Qinghe asked her: "How is your leap forward today? How many shortcomings have you overcome?" Wang Yumei didn't answer the question directly, but first put him on the spot: "I heard that the workers have a lot of opinions about your canteen! The bread is not baked well, and the dishes are too bland. You have to change it!" The old lady laughed and said: "In the past, when the family got together, it was all about firewood, rice, oil, and salt, or complaining to each other. Now, it's either talking about leap forward plans or talking about overcoming shortcomings."

        The Whole Family Becomes a Model

    Last September, in order to dedicate themselves to the 10th anniversary of the National Day, the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory organized a comprehensive production upsurge. The members of Wang Qinghe's family became rapid waves in this upsurge. Wang Yumei, the old lady, and Wang Qinghe discussed for several nights and finally made plans. They vowed to make their family a true model family in this competition. Wang Yumei asked the factory Party committee to go to the most difficult workshop, and the Party temporarily sent her to the weakest steaming workshop. Wang Qinghe slept in the canteen. The old lady automatically asked to do more work. The hearts of every member of this family are closely connected with the collective, the factory, and beat together with the pulse of socialist construction. At the alcohol factory, when the freshly boiled slurry spurted out of a thick steel pipe that was forgotten to be plugged, many female workers were frightened, but Wang Yumei rushed up and used her arms and body to block the ninety-degree slurry from spurting out, avoiding serious losses. However, she was burned all over and almost bleeding. This month, Wang Yumei overfulfilled the production task and was rated as a red flag pacesetter in the entire commune and a labor model in the Erqi District of Zhengzhou. Wang Qinghe enthusiastically led the canteen staff to bake excellent bread, make all kinds of pastries, and a variety of dishes. He sent these delicious foods to various workshops, so the canteen he led became a red flag canteen in Zhengzhou, and he himself was rated as a labor model in Zhengzhou. What about the old lady? She didn't lag behind at all, and received "Leap Forward Awards" in September and October, and her love for her son and daughter-in-law has never been so deep. In the middle of the night, she remembered that her daughter-in-law was working and sent her portion of the night meal to Yumei. Yumei was moved to tears several times and said, holding the rice bowl: "Mom, you eat it," but the old lady always said: "You do more and heavier work than I do, young people should eat more, eat it." She also wanted to see her son there when she was free and tell him that Yumei had become a female hero of the commune and that the Party committee secretary kept praising her, what a great daughter-in-law! Wang Qinghe looked at his mother with satisfaction, remembering that she had never said a good word about Yumei in front of him in the past, how quickly she had changed now. Every time at this time, he tried his best to hide his inner satisfaction, suppressed the laughter he wanted to burst out from his heart, and only told his mother: "Send a message to Yumei, I am chasing her."

    公社人家
    本报记者　陈健
    我在一处十分整洁的工人住宅区，找到了王玉梅的家，这时她家里没有人。晚饭时，我又到她家去访问，正碰上王玉梅的婆婆从食堂打饭回来，我说已经来过了，她抱歉的笑了，说：“全家都成了上班的人啦！我是公社托儿所的保育员，玉梅是公社酒精厂的工人，儿子汪清河是工厂的炊事员，两个孙子一清早就去托儿所，除非礼拜天，或吃饭的时候，你在俺家找不到人。”
    老太太刚把几样烧菜、一些饼子和馒头摆好，玉梅回来了。这天晚上，我也是这个家庭的客人。婆媳两个除热情的照顾客人外，还不时地互相把好菜偷偷地夹到对方碗内。看着她们那股亲密劲儿，可以想像这是一个多么融洽、和睦的家庭啊！吃饭的时候，婆媳两个告诉我许多关于她们家庭的事情。
    汪清河正离职在职工文化学校学习，这时也回来了，腋下夹着一卷作业。我要过他的作文本，在第一页上，看到这样的题目：“公社化后我的家庭的变化”，怎样变化的呢？让我们看看汪清河的这篇作文吧。人民公社带来了和睦家庭
    这个家庭，在城市人民公社里找到了真正的幸福、和睦、融洽和比较富裕的生活条件。但它却有着极其坎坷的过去的生活道路。解放前，汪清河的母亲带着儿子终年要饭。王玉梅那时还不是这个家庭的媳妇，她的“命运”比这母子还苦，很小就当童养媳，稍大后被转卖过几次。解放后，她跳出苦海，和纺织机械厂的炊事员汪清河结了婚。按理说，这些有着同样遭遇的人，结成一个家庭，应该很幸福的了，但是不然，他们虽然都知道解放后，生活比过去不知好了多少倍，还是有着新的苦恼，新的矛盾。王玉梅过去的牛马生活，没有摧毁她的强健的身体，她一身精力要想工作，但很快的有了两个孩子，被家务事拖住了。婆婆呢？一直是带着封建的传统的道德观念来看待儿媳，觉得她是嫁过人的人，瞧不起她。汪清河呢？一个人的工资，维持五口之家，有些紧张，每到月底就需要到左邻右舍借一点钱；这时，家庭问题也就更多了。那时汪清河一进家门，老太太不是吵玉梅把饭做多啦、少啦，就是吵做稀啦、稠啦，总之，一切都不顺眼。汪清河虽然那时已是共产党员，但对这样的家务纠葛，也没办法。
    什么是解决问题的根本办法呢？汪清河的作文里写的是：“城市人民公社给我带来了和睦、幸福的家庭”。
        婆媳和好了
    1958年9月，郑州纺织机械厂人民公社诞生了。王玉梅把孩子送到托儿所，带头到食堂吃饭，并且第一批参加了社办工厂。在公社成立的最初的日子里，会议多，工作忙，条件差，一切都是从头做起，王玉梅对于这一切，都是全力以赴不计得失。她对于彻底解放妇女的道理，比别人更喜欢听。婆婆看到儿媳妇变了，脸上经常有了笑容，对自己也比过去亲切了，很受感动，也跟着几个老太太去公社托儿所报了名。
    有一天晚上，一家几口围在一起，谈到深夜。玉梅说：“妈，过去咱们俩闷在家里，锅前转到锅后，屋里转到屋外，不开会，不听报告，不要说国家大事，就是咱们工厂的事情也不了解。加上我没有工作，碰上鸡毛蒜皮的事，就吵起来。我对你老人家不尊敬，家成了冰窑子……”。老太太说：“我不对，老脑筋。”汪清河被婆媳俩突变的思想感情所震动，不知说什么才好。多少年来，他盼着这一天，家里人人都有工作，和睦相爱，融洽相处，生活的状况也因此能有所改变。现在理想成了现实，他望望母亲，又望望妻子，终于说出：“毛主席给咱指出了路，咱们就要好好走，咱们过去没有把家管好，今后要成为模范家庭”。
    这个家完全变了。一年多来，母子三人没有缺过勤，没有吵过架，他们互相体贴，互相谅解，互相帮助。礼拜天，全家五口一起去看电影。晚上玉梅和汪清河去夜校学习，老太太每星期也要学习几次。汪清河因为最近一年进步得快，已被提拔为管理五千多人吃饭的大食堂的主任，现在正离职读初中的文化课；王玉梅学习上也是模范，已进业余高小了，现在是公社酒精厂一个小组的组长。这个家庭不仅和睦了，今年还开始储蓄了。有时候，听听这个家庭成员碰到一起时的谈话，那是很有趣的。王玉梅随身有个小日记本，记着自己的跃进规划，克服缺点的办法等。汪清河问她：“今天跃进得咋样？缺点克服几条？”王玉梅不正面回答问题，先将他一军：“我听说工人对你的食堂意见大啦！面包烤得不好，菜炒得太淡，要改噢！”老太太一边笑了，说：“过去一家人碰到一起，不是柴米油盐，就是互相埋怨，现在不是谈跃进规划，就是谈克服缺点。”
        全家成模范
    去年9月，郑州纺织机械厂为了向国庆十周年献礼，组织了全面的生产高潮。汪清河全家的成员，成了这个高潮中急骤的浪花。王玉梅、老太太、汪清河，商量了好几个夜晚，最后都订了计划。他们立志在这场竞赛中，使他们的家成为真正的模范家庭。王玉梅向工厂党委要求到最艰苦的车间去，党临时派她到工作最薄弱的蒸煮车间。汪清河睡在食堂里。老太太自动要求多做点工作。这个家庭的每一个成员的心，都和集体、和工厂紧紧相连，和社会主义建设事业的脉搏一起跳动。在酒精厂，当刚开锅的粉浆从一个被忘记堵塞的粗大钢管中向外喷泻时，许多女工都吓呆了，王玉梅却连忙扑了上去，用两个胳臂和身子堵住九十度的粉浆不使它往外喷泻，避免了严重的损失。但是，她混身都烫得快要出血。这个月，王玉梅超额完成生产任务，被评为全公社的红旗标兵、郑州二七区的劳动模范。汪清河干劲十足地领导食堂工作人员烤出出色的面包，做出各样糕点和多种多样的饭菜。他把这些可口的食品，送到各个车间，因此他领导的食堂成为全郑州市的红旗食堂，他自己被评为郑州市的劳动模范。老太太呢？一点也没有落后，9、10月份都领了“跃进奖”，而且对待儿子和媳妇的疼爱，也从来没有这么深。半夜三更，她想起媳妇正在工作；把自己的一份夜餐送给玉梅。玉梅好几次感动得流出泪，捧着饭碗说：“妈，你吃吧”，但是老太太总是说：“你比我做的活多、重，年青人要多吃，吃吧。”她有点空还要到儿子那里看看，告诉他玉梅成了公社的女英雄啦，党委书记一个劲地表扬她，这是个多么了不起的媳妇！汪清河满意地望着母亲，想起她过去从来没有在他面前说过玉梅一句好话，现在变得多快。每到这个时候，他极力掩藏着自己内心的满意，憋住从心里想发出的笑声，只是告诉母亲：“给玉梅捎个信，我在追她”。
