Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing—After completing their late autumn crop expansion plans, various regions in Jiangsu are building on their success and launching a mass campaign to plant late-late autumn crops on a large scale. As of August 3rd, the province had planted over 2 million mu of carrots, buckwheat, late potatoes, and other crops.

Late-late autumn crops are a powerful reserve force for grain production. Party committees at all levels in Jiangsu are paying close attention to the planting of these crops, treating late-late autumn as a regular grain harvest. Under the premise of looking ahead and behind, and rationally arranging crop rotations, various regions are expanding the planting area of late-late autumn without affecting this year's autumn sowing and next year's spring sowing areas. Taizhou County learned from the experience of last year, where single cropping of late-late autumn affected the autumn sowing of wheat. This year, they are vigorously promoting strip intercropping, such as intercropping carrots with buckwheat and mung beans. After the buckwheat is harvested, wheat can be interplanted. In this way, the county's late-late autumn area has expanded from over 180,000 mu last year to 270,000 mu, and the autumn sowing area can also be expanded by about 50,000 mu compared to last year. Various regions are also closely integrating the large-scale planting of late-late autumn with the investigation and elimination of wasteland, specifically arranging acreage by investigating boundary fields, remote fields, threshing grounds, roadsides, and field inspections, striving to plant all wasteland and vacant land. Through wasteland investigation and elimination, Zhenjiang Prefecture has planted over 60,000 mu of buckwheat and other crops.

In the movement to plant late-late autumn on a large scale, various regions have emphasized the technical specifications of sowing, changing the old habit of scattering seeds. Many counties have also specifically formulated operational procedures for cultivation techniques. Cadres at the three levels of Panrong and Sanshan Communes in Zhenjiang City are planting late-late autumn experimental plots, using the experimental plots as models to greatly improve the quality of sowing. The first batch of late-late autumn crops sown in Henglin Commune, Wujin County, all underwent deep plowing, wide ridges, and southern furrows, with 30 dan of refined fertilizer applied per mu.

This year, the late-late autumn crops planted in various regions have increased in many new varieties. For example, Huaiyin, Yancheng, and Nantong Prefectures have increased the planting of potatoes. Rice areas have expanded the planting of arrowhead and ratoon rice, while early crop areas have increased the planting of mung beans, miscellaneous beans, buckwheat, and other crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou—After overfulfilling the plan to plant one million mu of summer-sown coarse grains before the "Beginning of Autumn" by 30,000 mu, farmers on Hainan Island are taking advantage of the victory and continuing to expand the planting of autumn coarse grains.

Some areas of Hainan Island suffered from drought in the first half of this year, and early rice was affected to some extent. The Party committees in these areas put forward the slogan "Plant more coarse grains to compensate for the losses of early rice due to drought in some areas" and actively took measures to plant more coarse grains. Through the drought resistance and emergency planting campaign of the broad masses of cadres and people in various counties, the victory of emergency planting of coarse grains was finally achieved. The coarse grain areas in the western counties have all overfulfilled the planned planting tasks. From the "Beginning of Summer" to the "End of Heat" last year, Danxian County only planted 150,000 mu of sweet potatoes and minor coarse grains. This year, starting from the "Beginning of Summer," the county Party committee adopted the methods of resisting drought and emergency planting, and seizing the opportunity after rain to make all-out efforts, and had already planted over 200,800 mu by the "Great Heat." In the emergency planting, various regions fully mobilized the masses to investigate and eliminate wasteland, vigorously reclaim wasteland, and plant "five-side lands" on a large scale. Haitou Commune in Danxian County mobilized commune members to find more than 4,000 mu of arable land near the nearby rivers, riversides, and embankments, immediately reclaimed and planted, and overfulfilled the task of planting coarse grains.

    合理安排茬口  力争多种多收
    江苏大种晚晚秋作物
    海南岛乘胜前进扩种秋杂粮
    新华社南京电  江苏各地完成晚秋作物扩种计划后乘胜前进，又掀起了大种晚晚秋的群众运动。到3日止，全省已种胡萝卜、荞麦、晚马铃薯等共二百多万亩。
    晚晚秋作物是粮食上的一支强大的后备军，江苏各级党委十分重视这些作物的播种工作，把晚晚秋当作一熟粮食来抓。各地在瞻前顾后、合理安排茬口的前提下，做到既不影响今年的秋播和明年的春播面积，又扩大晚晚秋的种植面积。泰州县吸取去年晚晚秋单种影响秋播麦子的经验，今年大搞条播间种，如胡萝卜与荞麦、绿豆间种，荞麦收后就可套种麦子。这样，全县晚晚秋面积就由去年十八万多亩扩大到二十七万亩，秋播面积也可比去年扩大五万亩左右。各地还把大种晚晚秋和查荒灭荒紧密结合起来，通过查交界田、边远田、场头、路边和踏田查看，具体排面积，力争把所有荒地隙地都种上。镇江专区通过查荒灭荒，种下荞麦等作物六万多亩。
    在大种晚晚秋的运动中，各地都强调播种的技术规格，改变过去粒种的老习惯。许多县还专门拟订了栽培技术操作规程。镇江市盘荣、三山公社的三级干部种植晚晚秋试验田，以试验田做样板，大大提高了播种质量。武进县横林公社第一批播种的晚晚秋作物，全部做到深耕、阔埨、南方畦，每亩施精肥三十担。
    今年各地种植的晚晚秋增加了许多新品种。如淮阴、盐城、南通三专区增加了马铃薯，水稻地区扩种了茨菇、再生稻等作物，早作地区增种绿豆、杂豆、荞麦等作物。
    新华社广州电  海南岛在超额三万亩完成了“立秋”前夏种杂粮一百万亩的计划以后，全岛农民乘胜继续扩种秋杂粮。
    海南岛今年上半年有些地区受旱，早稻受到了一定的影响。这些地区的党委提出了“多种杂粮，弥补部分地区早稻受旱损失”的口号，积极采取措施，多种杂粮。经过各县广大干部、群众的抗旱抢种运动，终于获得了抢种杂粮的胜利。西部各县杂粮面积都超额完成了计划的种植任务。儋县去年从“立夏”开始到“处暑”，只种下甘薯、小杂粮十五万亩；今年从“立夏”开始，县委采取抗旱抢种和抓紧雨后时机全力突击的办法，截至“大暑”已经种下了二十万零八千多亩。各地在抢种中，充分发动群众查荒灭荒，大力开荒，大种“五边地”。儋县海头公社发动社员在附近的江边、河边、堤边找出可种土地四千多亩，立即开荒抢种，超额完成了杂粮种植任务。
