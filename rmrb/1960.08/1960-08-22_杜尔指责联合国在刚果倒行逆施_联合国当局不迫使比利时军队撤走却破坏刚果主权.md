Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, August 20th: Guinean President Touré's answers to questions from the Italian newspaper "Unità" were published by the Guinean Press Agency on the 19th. Touré said that the Guinean government feels seriously uneasy about the activities carried out in the Congo by the United Nations and the troops operating under the banner of the United Nations.

	He said: There is now a war in the Congo. This war is a conflict between the African continent and the colonial rulers.

	Touré said that the Congo declared its independence on June 30 this year. The power of the central government and the power of the Lumumba government have been recognized throughout the Republic of the Congo.

	Touré said: The United Nations cannot and should not receive any delegation from Katanga. He said that the United Nations authorities held direct talks with Tshombe (the imperialist puppet in Katanga Province of the Congo - editor's note), but according to the Constitution of the Republic of the Congo, Tshombe cannot be a negotiating opponent of the United Nations.

	Touré then pointed out: We are concerned about the situation in the Congo because of the following facts: all of the Congo's national army has been systematically disarmed under United Nations intervention, while the Belgian army and the troops loyal to Tshombe have remained fully armed; someone is illegally trying to force international public opinion to agree that there are two powers in the Congo: the power of the Lumumba government and the power of the Katanga provincial government; the United Nations authorities are carrying out activities that are fundamentally outside the scope of the plan prescribed by the (Congolese) government and undermining the power of the (Congolese) government; the United Nations claims that it has no intention of starting to force the withdrawal of the Belgian soldiers who caused the chaos in the Congo, but instead intends to organize all the structures of the Congolese state, that is to say, to make itself in practice the real government of the Congolese people.

	Touré said that, in our view, the United Nations authorities have violated the spirit of all the resolutions passed by the Security Council so far, which require the withdrawal of Belgian troops, respect for the territorial integrity of the Congo, and restoration of the Congo's legitimate rights and interests. Touré said: The Guinean government is determined to expose this shameful deception.

	Touré said that we want to achieve peace in Africa and the world, which is a favorable factor for fruitful cooperation between countries, but we do not approve of reconciliation in the Congo under the supervision of the United Nations.

	Speaking of foreign policy, Touré said: We have always expressed our willingness to cooperate with all countries on the basis of active neutralism, on the basis of respect for our sovereignty and characteristics, and on the basis of the interests of our people. Touré said that in the economic field, decolonization is the most important thing.

    杜尔指责联合国在刚果倒行逆施
    联合国当局不迫使比利时军队撤走却破坏刚果主权
    新华社科纳克里20日电　几内亚通讯社19日发表了几内亚总统杜尔答意大利“团结报”记者问。杜尔说，几内亚政府对于联合国和打着联合国幌子的部队在刚果所进行的活动，感到严重的不安。
    他说：现在在刚果存在着战争。这场战争是非洲大陆同殖民统治者的冲突。
    杜尔说，刚果已于今年6月30日宣布独立。中央的权力和卢蒙巴政府的权力，已在刚果共和国全境得到承认。
    杜尔说：联合国不能也不应该接见加丹加的任何代表团。他说，联合国当局同冲伯（帝国主义在刚果加丹加省的傀儡——编者注）举行了直接的会谈，而依据刚果共和国宪法，冲伯不能作为联合国的谈判对手。
    杜尔接着指出：我们对刚果局势感到不安是由于如下的事实：刚果的全部国家军队已在联合国干预之下有计划地被解除武装，而比利时军队以及忠于冲伯的军队则始终完全保持着武装；有人非法地企图强使国际舆论同意在刚果有两种权力存在：卢蒙巴政府的权力和加丹加省政府的权力；联合国当局进行着根本不在（刚果）政府所规定的计划范围之内的活动并破坏（刚果）政府的权力；联合国声称无意着手促使造成刚果的混乱的比利时士兵撤走，而是要从事组织刚果国家的一切结构，就是说要使自己在实际上成为刚果人民的名副其实的政府。
    杜尔说，在我们看来，联合国当局违反了安全理事会到目前为止所通过的一切决议的精神，而安全理事会要求比利时军队撤走、尊重刚果的领土完整和恢复刚果的合法权益。杜尔说：几内亚政府决意要揭露这种可耻的骗局。
    杜尔说，我们要在非洲和全世界实现和平，这是对于各国之间进行有成果的合作的有利因素，但是我们不赞成刚果在联合国监护之下进行和解。
    杜尔谈到外交政策时说：我们一向表示愿意在积极中立主义的基础上、在尊重我国的主权和特性的基础上、在我们人民利益的基础上，同一切国家合作。杜尔说，在经济方面，实行非殖民地化是最重要的。
