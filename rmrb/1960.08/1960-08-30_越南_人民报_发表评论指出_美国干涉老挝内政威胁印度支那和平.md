Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 29th. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today pointing out that "the situation in Laos has become tense again due to the blatant interference of US imperialism and its lackeys."

The newspaper, in a commentary entitled "Oppose US Imperialism and Its Lackeys' Interference in Lao Internal Affairs," pointed out that "US imperialism, on the one hand, slanders that the communists are threatening Laos, and uses dollars and weapons to help the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group organize armed forces, attempting to re-launch the civil war and oppose Captain Kong Le's patriotic forces and the legitimate government led by Souvanna Phouma; on the other hand, on August 26, it gathered some representatives of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc countries it manipulates in Bangkok to hold a meeting to plot interference in Laos. US imperialism also uses its lackeys in Thailand to impose an economic blockade on Vientiane, openly threatening and provoking the Lao people, and directly interfering in Laos' internal affairs."

The commentary emphasized that "all the conspiracies of US imperialism and the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, as well as US imperialism's lackeys in Thailand, to interfere in Laos, not only seriously infringe upon the sovereignty and independence of the Lao people and violate the Geneva Accords and the UN Charter, but also threaten the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia."

The commentary pointed out that "the interference in Laos by US imperialism and its lackeys once again makes it clear to the Lao people and the people of the world who are the enemies of the Lao people and the genuine peace and neutral policy that the Lao people hope to achieve."

The commentary finally solemnly stated: "The Vietnamese people, who have always been concerned about the situation in Laos, are responsible for the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Laos, and sympathize with the just struggle of the Lao people, cannot turn a blind eye to the acts of US imperialism and its lackeys in interfering in Lao internal affairs. The Vietnamese people, together with the people of Southeast Asia and peace-loving countries all over the world, resolutely oppose such interference and believe that the fate of Laos must be decided by the Lao people, and no one should interfere."

    越南“人民报”发表评论指出
    美国干涉老挝内政威胁印度支那和平
    新华社河内29日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论指出，“由于美帝国主义及其走狗的露骨的干涉，老挝局势又紧张了起来”。
    这家报纸在题为“反对美帝国主义及其走狗干涉老挝内政”的评论中指出，“美帝国主义一方面污蔑共产党威胁老挝，用美元和武器帮助富米·诺萨万叛乱集团组织武装力量，企图重新发动内战和反对贡勒大尉的爱国力量和梭发那·富马领导的合法政府；另一方面在8月26日纠集了它所操纵的东南亚侵略集团国家的一些代表在曼谷举行会议，策划干涉老挝。美帝国主义还利用他们在泰国的走狗，对万象进行经济封锁，公然威胁老挝人民，向他们进行挑衅，并直接干涉老挝的内部事务。”
    评论强调指出，“美帝国主义和东南亚侵略集团以及美帝国主义在泰国的走狗干涉老挝的一切阴谋活动，不但严重地侵犯了老挝人民的主权和独立，违反日内瓦协议和联合国宪章，而且威胁着印度支那和东南亚的和平。”
    评论指出，“美帝国主义及其走狗对老挝的干涉，再一次使老挝和世界人民清楚地看到谁是老挝人民和老挝人民所希望实现的真正的和平、中立政策的敌人。”
    评论最后严正表示：“一贯关心老挝局势、对关于老挝的日内瓦协议的履行负有责任和同情老挝人民的正义斗争的越南人民，对美帝国主义及其走狗干涉老挝内政的行为决不能熟视无睹。越南人民同东南亚和全世界爱好和平的国家的人民一起，坚决反对这种干涉行为，并认为，老挝的命运必须由老挝人民决定，任何人不得插手其间。”
