Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 8th. The Hungarian National Assembly held a meeting in Budapest on August 4th and 5th.

At the meeting, Kristóf, Secretary of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, gave a summary report on the work of the Presidium since the last National Assembly.

Subsequently, Ferenc Münnich, Premier of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, delivered a summary report on the government's work at the meeting. In his report, he discussed the development of the Hungarian national economy in the first half of this year. He said that in the first half of this year, the production of Hungarian state-owned industry increased by 15% compared with the same period last year, exceeding the plan by 4%. In the first half of the year, the average output per worker increased by 8% compared with the same period last year. He said that 52% of the over-fulfillment of the plan by Hungarian state-owned industry in the first half of the year was due to the increase in labor productivity. In the future, it is necessary to continue to tap production potential and improve labor productivity.

When talking about agricultural issues, Münnich pointed out that the socialist transformation of Hungarian agriculture continued to develop in the first half of this year. At present, the cultivated area of state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives accounts for three-quarters of the total cultivated area in the country.

Münnich emphasized that the socialist transformation of Hungarian agriculture has not yet ended, and efforts must be made. In order to develop agricultural collectivization, the state will continue to provide various forms of assistance to agricultural production cooperatives in the future.

Münnich said that Hungary's economic, political, and social life are developing healthily.

The meeting also heard the report made by the Hungarian Minister of Finance, Nyers, on the 1959 Hungarian national budget. The meeting successively discussed and approved the reports of Münnich and Nyers.
