    "Infant" Type Passenger Helicopter: Light and Nimble
    Soviet aircraft designer Kamov recently designed a light and nimble "Infant" type helicopter. It is currently the smallest passenger helicopter in the Soviet Union, with passenger and ambulance types.
    This helicopter is based on the famous "Ka-18" type helicopter. It has two coaxial rotors, which makes it easy to reduce the size of the aircraft and reduce the structural weight. The engine has 280 horsepower. The passenger type can carry three passengers, with a range of 300 kilometers. The ambulance type can carry one lying patient and one doctor, with a range of 500 kilometers. It can fly in complex weather conditions during the day and in ordinary weather conditions at night.

    “婴孩”型客运直升飞机轻便灵巧
    苏联飞机设计师卡莫夫前不久设计出了一种轻便灵巧的“婴孩”型直升飞机。它是目前苏联最小的直升客机，有客运和救护等类型。
    这种直升飞机是在著名的“卡—18”型直升飞机基础上制成的。它具有两付同轴旋翼，这种结构便于缩小飞机尺寸和减轻结构重量。发动机具有二百八十马力。客运型可载运三位乘客，续航距离是三百公里。救护型可载运一位躺着的病人和一位医师，续航距离五百公里。它可以在白天复杂气象条件以及夜间普通气象条件下飞行。
