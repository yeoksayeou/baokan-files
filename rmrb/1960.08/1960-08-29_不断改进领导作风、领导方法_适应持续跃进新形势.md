The Fuxin City Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, Fuxin City has adhered to and implemented the Party's General Line for socialist construction. After more than two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, tremendous changes have taken place in industrial production. With basically no change in coalfield area, equipment, and labor force, coal production in 1958 increased by 80% compared to 1957, and in 1959 it increased by 43% on this basis. In the first half of this year, it increased by another 33.4% compared to the same period in 1959. The output of the entire mining area has jumped to the first place in the country, establishing a red flag for sustained high production in large enterprises. The red flag of railway transportation has been raised higher and higher. In more than a year, five transportation revolutions have been carried out, reducing the station stop time of vehicles from twelve hours at the end of 1958 to less than five hours, achieving the equivalent of one vehicle doing the work of three. In terms of technical innovation and technical revolution, starting with the successful creation of the coal loading machine, a comprehensive technical transformation of coal mine production was rapidly launched. More than 60% of the coal mining sites in the mines have implemented a new coal mining method centered on hydraulic transportation; open-pit mines have adopted a series of new technologies such as short-distance soil discharge, multi-exit transportation, and high-section stripping and mining. The daily production level of the Haizhou Large Open-Pit Mine has exceeded twice the original design, realizing a transformation from one mine into three mines.

The process of continuous Great Leap Forward over the past two years has been a process of struggle between the two lines of more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive, a process of ideological revolution, and also a process of continuous improvement of leadership style and methods. The Party's General Line is the driving force for the entire work development.

In the era of the Great Leap Forward, the situation has been developing rapidly, and new problems, new experiences, and new technologies have been emerging in large numbers. The new situation requires leaders to understand the changing new situation at any time, make correct deployments for work, discover new problems in time, and solve them quickly; grasp new experiences and summarize and promote them immediately. This requires a more in-depth, more practical, and more specific leadership style. An in-depth and solid leadership style and leadership methods have further promoted the whole Party and the whole people to better implement the General Line and promote the continuous Great Leap Forward of production and construction. In early 1958, three leadership experiences emerged in our city: leading cadres cultivating "experimental fields," participating in production and leading production, and moving to workers' residential areas to settle down. Over the past two years, according to the principles of combining the general and the individual, and combining leadership and the masses, put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong, we have continuously improved the city's leadership style and leadership methods.

	Half the time above
	Half the time below

According to the spirit of the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the Municipal Party Committee stipulated in 1958 that "municipal leading cadres should spend half of their time each week going deep into the grassroots." At the beginning, some people doubted: can municipal-level leading cadres spend half of their time below? Two years of practice have proved that it is entirely possible. Our comrades above the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee, except for going out to meetings, spend about three or four days a week in grassroots activities. The key to whether municipal leading cadres can take more time to go deep is whether they have the determination. If we sit in the office all year round, of course, there will still be many meetings to be held, many documents to be read, and many problems to be solved; however, as long as we walk out of the office and go to the grassroots and the front line more often, the situation will be completely different. Because after consistently implementing the Party's policies and solving the existing problems below on the spot, the above meetings, receptions, round-trip official documents, and other affairs will naturally decrease accordingly. This will not only not affect daily work, but also make leadership more active, overcome the busy bureaucratic style, and be able to grasp the production situation in a timely manner. Leadership becomes more practical and therefore more effective. Secondly, there is the issue of work arrangement. We must strictly control meetings and documents. We stipulate that large meetings at the municipal level must be approved by the Secretariat of the Municipal Party Committee, and professional meetings must be approved by the Municipal Party Committee secretary in charge. All meetings that can be held or not will not be held. The problems to be solved in the meeting will be taken down and solved on the spot. Except for major issues that are handled personally, daily work will be handed over to the competent departments for settlement, freeing up time to go down more often. The leading cadres of the Municipal Party Committee take the lead in going deep, which has a great impact on the grassroots cadres. Now, cadres at the factory and mine level go deep into the front line to direct production, and cadres at the pit entrance and workshop level follow shifts to participate in production and lead production, which has become a system and is often adhered to. They spend more than two-thirds of their time each year in production site activities; many units have implemented the "two-four system" or "two-five system" (that is, four or five days a week at the site). Recently, all coal mines have universally implemented "office work underground," and all factories and enterprises have implemented on-site office work, institutionalizing the on-site command of production and doing political and ideological work at the workplace, machine tool, and construction site. This is a product of the continuous deepening of leadership style. It enables leadership to be frequently in the forefront and can better adapt to the needs of continuous production and sustained leap forward. Going deep into the grassroots and going deep into the front line has become a trend in the city's vast number of cadres. In the past, some people felt at ease sitting in the office all year round, but now it seems as if there are thorns on the chair, and they can't sit still!

Where should we go after going deep? In the past, some comrades walked out of the office building and into the offices of factories and mines or workshops and pit entrances, simply convening meetings and reports from below, and accepting second-hand and third-hand materials, without being able to go to the production site in person. This can only be regarded as moving the office and is an incomplete "deepening." We criticized this practice. We advocate going to the bottom, going to the front line of production, going to the workers, directly contacting production reality and the masses of employees, and fully occupying first-hand materials; at the same time, studying problems together with grassroots leaders, and of course, holding meetings and listening to reports when necessary, so that the opinions of all parties can be gathered. In this way, we can have a true understanding of the actual situation and make correct judgments and decisions on production and work.

To go to the bottom, we must have a hard-working and simple style and a style of contacting the masses, appearing among the masses as ordinary workers, without putting on airs or showing special privileges. The leading comrades of the Municipal Party Committee go to the site to understand the situation, inspect work, and solve problems; at the same time, they also participate in production, often picking coal, carrying coal, carrying explosives, and loading trucks with the workers, resting together with the workers, eating together, and chatting about family affairs. In this way, workers and cadres talk about everything and truly become close friends, not only can they hear the true opinions and demands of the masses and deeply understand the production situation, but also greatly stimulate the fighting spirit and enthusiasm of the vast number of employees, and the relationship between superiors and subordinates and between leaders and the masses is also closer. Leading cadres go deep, not simply to be an ordinary worker, let alone to replace the duties of grassroots cadres, but to better play the role of a leader.

As a leader who goes deep into the grassroots, how can one play one's role? First, grasp the main contradictions and major key issues in actual work. For a period of time, the amount of stripping in Haizhou Mine was not small, but the amount of recoverable coal obtained did not increase significantly. In the process of going deep into this mine, we found that the key open-pit coal projects were not grasped enough. In July, we helped this mine concentrate its superior forces to tackle ten key open-pit coal projects, exposing more than 100,000 tons of coal of four types in July alone. This shows that only by grasping the main contradictions and major key issues can we effectively promote actual work. There are always thousands of threads in actual work, and there are many problems that need to be solved. If we do not distinguish between primary and secondary, and grasp everything at once, or even grasp the secondary and lose the primary, it will not only have little effect on promoting actual work, but also take over the leadership work of the grassroots and affect the enthusiasm of the grassroots cadres, reducing ourselves to the level of a grassroots cadre.

Second, discover, support, and vigorously promote new things. On the one hand, new things have the most significant role in promoting work "from points to the whole"; on the other hand, grassroots cadres sometimes do not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of new things due to the limitations of their position and level of understanding. In addition, when new things first appear, they are often not very perfect and easily encounter great resistance. This requires comrades from above to pay more attention and put more effort into this aspect. The experience of the coal loading machine, which fired the first shot of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the Fuxin mining area this year, fully illustrates this point. After the successful creation of the coal loading machine by employees of Xinqiu Mine at the end of last year, it was not widely promoted and used for nearly a month. Later, leading cadres of the Municipal Party Committee and the Mining Bureau went to the mine for research and appraisal and found that it was a major technical revolution with universal significance in the coal industry. They immediately convened an on-site meeting to vigorously promote it, seriously criticizing the conservative ideas that discriminated against the coal loading machine, and helped various mines improve and create new coal loading machines, solving the problem of materials for creating a large number of coal loading machines. As a result, a mass movement of technical revolution on an unprecedented scale was launched in the Fuxin mining area. In a few days, the entire mining area basically realized the mechanization of coal loading.

Third, find problems and solve them on the spot. Key issues must be grasped to the end and never abandoned halfway. When Fuxin Station carried out the fourth technical revolution and built a graded automatic loading line, the leading comrades of the Municipal Party Committee presided over the city's large-scale collaboration, mobilized various departments to support manpower and materials; personally went to the site to grasp the design and the progress of the project, and finally completed this technically complex and major project at an astonishing speed, greatly improving the efficiency of transportation and loading. An old construction worker with thirty-seven years of civil engineering experience said: "This work would take at least two years in the puppet Manchukuo; under the leadership of the Communist Party, without the General Line, it would take a year; now that the secretary is in command, with the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, it would take half a year." As a result, it was not half a year, but forty-odd days that the entire project was completed.

	Drive the stake all the way to the bottom

Driving the stake all the way to the bottom is the most effective form of achieving a highly close combination of leadership and the masses, and it has a very significant effect on promoting the completion of various tasks. The so-called "bottom" is the broad masses, the most active and most positive factor in the productive forces. If the Party's leadership "stake" is driven all the way to the "bottom" of the broad masses of employees, it will produce tremendous material strength, quickly realize the Party's call, and solve the problems existing in production quickly and thoroughly. From many practices, we have deeply realized that this is a high-quality and high-efficiency work method that adapts to the new situation of continuous production leap forward.

We have institutionalized and regularized the method of driving the stake all the way to the bottom with meetings, and universally promoted it in coal mines and railway transportation. The characteristics of the "meeting to drive the stake all the way to the bottom" are: problems that several enterprises or several projects cannot solve alone are solved by convening a collaboration meeting; participants range from the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, the director, the secretary of the Party Committee, the mine manager, grassroots cadres, technical personnel to workers, including all aspects of the "three combinations"; the number of people is not limited, from a dozen to hundreds; the meeting place is at the site, wherever the key is, the meeting is held there; meetings are held during shifts, without hindering production and workers' rest; focusing on one center, let everyone speak out freely, everything has a master, answer on the spot, and decide on the spot. This new type of meeting is very popular with workers and grassroots cadres, who say that this is a "motivational meeting," a "knot-untangling meeting"... People say, "We have to hold a meeting to drive the stake all the way to the bottom" whenever they feel that there are many problems. Cadres and the masses both regard it as the most problem-solving meeting and have a high degree of trust in it. According to the experience in actual work, we believe that it has the following three benefits:

First, the Party's urgent instructions are implemented in a timely and accurate manner. In the past, the implementation of the Party's urgent instructions generally took the method of transmitting layer by layer and deploying level by level. When it was transmitted to the workers, often only one sentence remained: "Today, we are going to produce at a high rate, so everyone should work hard." After adopting the method of driving the stake all the way to the bottom, the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, the secretary of the enterprise Party Committee, and the administrative leaders personally went to the site to directly explain the situation, assign tasks, and make mobilization reports to the workers. Not only is it fast and accurate, but also the vigorous and resolute combat style of the leading cadres greatly encourages the workers, and the Party's instructions immediately become the masses' vows, and then form a upsurge of comparing enthusiasm and measures. Ping'an Mine No. 1 Pit changed the past practice of arranging layer by layer and created a "three-combination" mass production meeting, with each shift using the method of driving the stake all the way to the bottom to formulate production plans. After the "three-combination" mass production meeting was implemented in May, this pit exceeded its production target for months. By the end of June, it had completed half of its annual plan with an overfulfillment of 6%.

Second, problems are solved quickly and thoroughly. The discharge spout of the coal bunker after selection in Haizhou Mine was long, and it could not be discharged when it encountered large trucks, and needed to be cut off. In the past, workers had raised this issue many times but it had not been resolved. At the meeting to drive the stake all the way to the bottom, the workers raised it again. We asked, "Whose responsibility is it?" The director of the coal preparation plant immediately stood up and said to the masses: "It will be resolved tonight!" But the next day, the workers raised the issue again, saying: "It has been cut, but it is not enough, and the truck still can't pass." So it was cut again that day, and the problem was completely solved. Similar situations have great educational significance for both workers and cadres. The workers talk about problems and think about measures with the leading cadres such as the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee face to face, and they feel that they are both producers and managers, feel comfortable, and their enthusiasm is greatly increased. Cadres answer questions in front of the masses, which actually forms a kind of mass supervision, and they try their best to solve the problems they promised to solve as soon as possible. Adhering to such meetings is a great promotion for cadres to improve their style.

Third, some problems are very complicated, and it is difficult to get to the bottom of them for a while, so workers and grassroots cadres from all relevant links are convened to participate, and a "three-way confrontation" is launched to carry out a large debate, and the truth will soon be revealed. At Fuxin Station, there was no problem with allocating cars, loading cars, or driving cars for a period of time, but the operation time was still very long. At the meeting to drive the stake all the way to the bottom for all relevant parties, the workers said: "If the roadblocks are not removed, the operation time will not be shortened." The "roadblock" refers to the No. 9 switch room, which is far from the command post, and the leadership cannot take care of it, and car separation often occurs. After the meeting, the command post immediately sent cadres to strengthen leadership, and the "roadblock" became a "collaboration station," and the problem of car separation was quickly resolved.

Why does the method of driving the stake all the way to the bottom have such a great effect? The reason is that the enthusiasm of the leadership and the enthusiasm of the masses have reached a high degree of combination through the meeting to drive the stake all the way to the bottom. A cadre said well: "One cadre can only grasp a hundred, but if the cadres and workers grasp together, they can grasp thousands or millions, and problems will be solved quickly!"

	Large-scale cultivation of "experimental fields" to drive the whole area

Since the Great Leap Forward, we have often adopted two forms to use the working method of driving the whole area with points. One is: every time a central task is deployed, an inspection team is organized to go deep into the production front line for a tour inspection. The other is to cultivate "experimental fields." The inspection team is headed by the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and leading cadres of various agencies participate. Wherever problems are found, they are helped to solve them; wherever experience is found, on-site meetings are convened to summarize and promote them, both skimming the surface and going deep. Technical innovation projects such as coal loading mechanization, soil coal gasification, and production linkage are universally promoted in the city in a few days under the promotion of the inspection team. In 1958, after the Party Central Committee proposed to universally promote the experience of cultivating "experimental fields" in all aspects, the main leading cadres of the Municipal Party Committee and the leading cadres of various factories and mines established their own "experimental fields" and maintained regular and fixed contacts. According to the statistics of only three mines in the entire mining area, the "experimental fields" of the leading cadres at the mine level numbered eighteen. The workers and grassroots cadres in the "field" are all proud of the participation of leading cadres in their labor here, and try their best to "not let the leadership lose face." The leading cadres also participate in production in the "experimental fields" in a down-to-earth manner, helping the "experimental fields" implement the Party's policies, study and solve specific problems in production, and explore new experiences. Most of the "experimental fields" are "high-yield fields," and major experiences such as hydraulic transportation, short-distance soil discharge, and road and mine collaboration in railway transportation are all products of the "experimental fields."

Will going deep into key "experimental fields" hinder guiding the overall situation? It depends on what you use to guide the overall situation, is it subjective things or living experiences created by the masses in production practice? Facts have proved: "Any leader who does not obtain specific experience from individual units, individual personnel, and individual events at the lower level will not be able to give universal guidance to all units." (Mao Zedong: "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership") Conversely, anyone who goes deep into production and deep into the masses will discover many new things that have a great promoting significance for production development. When we were cultivating "experimental fields" in the third coal mining section of the fifth pit of Ping'an Mine, we discovered such a new thing. A tunneling working face that was being sent up the mountain was about to stop work due to the lack of a coal chute. At the same time, there was accumulated water in the roadway above this tunneling working face, which often flowed through the working face and washed away a lot of coal. The workers came up with a way to simply do without the chute, and release the water in the roadway to flush the coal after drilling and blasting. As a result, the efficiency was 80% higher than using the chute to transport coal. The workers' creation gave us a very important inspiration: the chute in the coal mining working face has many faults, which is the most prominent weak link in improving output. Can the method of using hydraulic transportation in the tunneling working face be extended to the coal mining working face? After discussing with the workers in the "experimental field," we immediately started the experiment, and finally created a complete set of hydraulic transportation experience from equipment installation, mining area design to underground dewatering, which increased the monthly output of this thin coal seam from the original three or four thousand tons to seven or eight thousand tons. Grasping this specific experience obtained from individual events of individual units, we put forward the slogan of universally promoting hydraulic transportation experience and implementing comprehensive technical reform to Ping'an Mine. Under the support and cultivation of the Party, new things have grown and developed. Hydraulic transportation has not only been adhered to in the third section of the fifth pit, but also has been promoted on 80% of the working faces in Ping'an Mine. This year, it has also developed into a new coal mining method centered on hydraulic transportation, which has powerfully promoted the production leap forward. After the sixth section of the second pit of Ping'an Mine implemented the new coal mining method, the average daily output increased from the original three or four hundred tons to about one thousand tons; the birthplace of hydraulic transportation - the third section of the fifth pit created a new record of 18,820 tons of thin coal seam monthly output in June in the entire mining area.

Practice has proved that guiding the overall work must be based on the experience obtained through in-depth key points. In the process of guiding the overall situation, it is still necessary to continue to go deep into new key points and specifically solve the new problems that arise in the promotion. In this way, our leadership work will always be more in line with objective reality, and we will not make subjective mistakes, and we can correct them in time if we make them. Therefore, since 1958, we have been adhering to and developing the experience of cultivating "experimental fields." Wherever the production key is, we cultivate "experimental fields" there; wherever new things emerge, we cultivate "experimental fields" there. The "experimental field" has become our "base" for frequently going deep into the production front line, a "base" for contacting the masses, and a "base" for cultivating new things. Through the method of cultivating "experimental fields," we specifically implement Chairman Mao's teaching of combining the general and the individual, and promote the continuous leap forward of production.

The improvement of leadership style and the improvement of leadership methods are also a process of ideological revolution. The working method of "from the masses, to the masses" is not only the product of Marxist scientific epistemology, but also closely related to the style of hard work and simplicity. To come from the masses, one must first go to the production front line where the masses are active. Our advocacy of this inevitably leads to contradictions and struggles with the subjective or comfort-loving habits of some comrades. This struggle is essentially a struggle between the dialectical materialism world outlook and the idealism world outlook, a struggle between the vigorous proletarian world outlook and the decadent world outlook of cowards and lazy people. The process of improving leadership style is also a process of ideological transformation. Therefore, we have always paid attention to strengthening political and ideological work in calling on cadres to improve their leadership style.

Leadership style and leadership methods are part of the superstructure. Production relations must adapt to the development of productive forces, and the superstructure must adapt to the needs of the economic base. Only by adjusting and improving production relations and the superstructure according to the spirit of continuous revolution can we continuously open up roads for the continuous leap forward of productive forces. From this principle, there are still some problems in examining our leadership style and leadership methods. These problems are mainly that some comrades still have a formalistic style in going deep into the front line, only skimming the surface and not solving problems; some new experiences and new problems in leadership methods are not summarized in a timely manner, and so on. We must continue to work hard, continuously improve our leadership style, improve our leadership methods, and more fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses to promote a greater leap forward in productive forces.

    不断改进领导作风、领导方法　适应持续跃进新形势
    中共阜新市委员会
    阜新市在党中央、毛主席和辽宁省委正确领导下，坚持贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，经过两年多的持续大跃进，工业生产面貌发生了巨大变化。在煤田面积、设备和人力基本没有变化的条件下，煤炭产量1958年比1957年增长80％，1959年在这个基础上增长43％，今年上半年比1959年同期又增长33.4％，全矿区的产量跃居全国首位，树立了大企业持续高产的红旗。铁路运输红旗越举越高，在一年多的时间里，进行五次运输革命，使车辆的站停时间由1958年底的十二小时缩短到五小时以下，做到一个车顶三个车用。在技术革新和技术革命方面，由攉煤机创造成功开始，迅速展开了煤矿生产的全面技术改造。矿井有60％以上的采煤场子，实行了以水力运输为中心的新采煤法；露天矿则采用了近距离排土、多出口运输、高段剥离和采煤等一系列新技术。海州大露天矿日产水平已经超过原设计两倍，实现了一矿变三矿。
    两年多以来持续大跃进的过程，是多快好省和少慢差费两条路线斗争的过程，是思想革命的过程，也是不断改进领导作风、领导方法的过程，而党的总路线则是整个工作发展的动力。
    在大跃进的年代里，形势发展一日千里，新问题、新经验、新技术不断地大量涌现。新的形势要求领导者随时了解变化着的新情况，对工作作出正确的部署，及时发现新问题，迅速加以解决；抓住新经验，马上总结推广。这就要求领导作风更加深入、更加切实、更加具体。而深入扎实的领导作风和领导方法，又进一步推动全党全民更好地贯彻执行总路线、推动生产建设事业持续大跃进。1958年初，我市出现了领导干部种“试验田”、参加生产领导生产、搬到工人住宅区落户等三项领导经验。两年多以来，根据毛泽东同志所提出的一般和个别相结合、领导和群众相结合的原则，我们又不断地改进了市的领导作风和领导方法。
      一半时间在上面
      一半时间在下面
    根据党中央的指示精神，市委在1958年就规定了“市委领导干部每周要有一半时间深入基层”。开始有人怀疑：市一级领导干部要有一半时间在下面，能不能做到？两年来的实践证明，完全能够做到。我们市委常委以上的同志，除了外出开会以外，每星期约有三、四天下基层活动。市的领导干部能不能抽出比较多的时间深入下去，关键在于有没有决心。如果我们长年坐在办公室，当然也还会有不少会要开，不少文件要看，不少问题要解决；可是，只要我们走出办公室，多到基层到现场去以后，情况就完全两样了。因为把党的方针政策一贯到底，下面存在的问题就地解决以后，上面的会议、接待、往返行文及其他事务自然会随之减少，不但不影响日常工作，反而使领导更主动，克服了忙忙碌碌的事务主义作风，能够及时掌握生产情况，领导更加切合实际，因而也更加有效。其次是工作安排问题，要严格控制会议、文件。我们规定：市一级的大会议必须经市委书记处批准才能召开，专业性会议必须市委主管书记批准，凡是可开可不开的会议一律不开，把会议所要解决的问题带下去就地解决；日常工作除重大问题亲自处理外，一般问题交给主管部门解决，腾出时间多下去。市委领导干部带头深入下去，对基层干部影响很大。现在，厂矿一级干部深入现场指挥生产，坑口和车间干部跟班参加生产领导生产，已经形成制度，经常坚持。他们每年有三分之二以上的时间在生产现场活动；许多单位实行了“二四制”或“二五制”（即每星期有四天或五天下现场）。最近，各煤矿又普遍推行了“井下办公”，各工厂企业实行了现场办公，把现场指挥生产制度化，把政治思想工作做到场子头、机床头、工地上。这是领导作风不断深入的产物。它使领导深入第一线经常化，能更好地适应连续生产、持续跃进的需要。深入基层、深入现场，在全市广大干部中已经形成风气。过去有些人一年到头坐办公室心安理得，现在好像椅子上长了刺，坐不住了！
    深入下去下到哪里？以前有些同志走出机关办公室，又走进厂矿或车间、坑口的办公室，单纯地召集下面开会、汇报，接受第二手、第三手材料，而不能亲临生产现场。这只能算是办公室搬家，是不彻底的“深入”。我们批判了这种做法。我们提倡一下到底，下到生产第一线，下到工人中去，直接接触生产实际和职工群众，充分占有第一手材料；同时跟基层领导干部共同研究问题，必要时当然也开会、听汇报，使各方面的意见汇集起来。这样就能够对实际情况有真切的了解，对生产和工作做出正确的判断和决定。
    一下到底，必须有艰苦朴素、联系群众的作风，以普通劳动者的姿态在群众中出现，不摆架子，不显特殊。市委领导同志下现场一面了解情况，检查工作，解决问题；一面也插手参加生产，时常跟工人一起拣煤、抬煤、扛火药、装车，和工人一起休息，一起吃饭，一起谈家常。这样，工人和干部无话不谈，真正成了知心朋友，不但能听到群众真正的意见和要求，深入了解生产情况，而且极大地激发了广大职工的斗志和干劲，上级与下级、领导与群众的关系也更加亲密了。领导干部深入下去，不简单是做一名普通劳动者，更不是去代替基层干部的职务，而是要更好地发挥作为领导者的作用。
    作为一个深入基层的领导者，怎样发挥自己的作用？一，抓实际工作中的主要矛盾、重大关键问题。有一个时期，海州矿剥离量不算少，但可采煤获得量却不见显著增加。我们在深入这个矿的过程中，发现原来是重点露煤工程抓得不够，7月份就帮助这个矿集中优势力量突击十项重点露煤工程，仅7月份就露出四型十多万吨煤炭。这说明，下去只有抓住主要矛盾、重大关键问题，才能有效地推动实际工作。实际工作中总是千头万绪，需要解决的问题很多，下去如果不分主次，眉毛胡子一把抓，甚至抓住次要的丢掉主要的，不但对实际工作推动作用不大，而且包办了基层领导工作，影响基层干部积极性的发挥，把自己降低到一个基层干部的水平。
    二，发现、扶植和大力推广新事物。因为一方面，新事物最具有“以点带面”推动工作的作用；另一方面，基层干部由于所处地位和认识水平的限制，有时对新事物的重大意义认识不足，再加上新事物刚出现时，往往不很完善，容易遇到很大的阻力，这就要求上面下来的同志，在这方面多加注意，多下功夫。打响阜新矿区今年技术革新技术革命运动第一炮的攉煤机的经历，就充分说明了这一点。新丘矿职工在去年末首创攉煤机成功以后，在将近一个月内一直没有大量推广使用，后来市委和矿务局领导干部到矿上经过研究鉴定，发现它是煤炭工业中具有普遍意义的一项重大技术革命，便立刻召开现场会议大力推广，严肃批判了歧视攉煤机的保守思想，并且帮助各矿改进和创造新的攉煤机，解决大批创造攉煤机的材料问题。结果，阜新矿区掀起了一场空前规模的技术革命群众运动，几天工夫，全矿区便基本上实现了攉煤机械化。
    三，发现问题，就地解决问题，其中具有关键意义的，要一手抓到底，决不半途而废。阜新车站进行第四次技术革命，修建分级自动装车线的时候，市委领导同志主持全市大协作，发动各部门支援人力、物力；亲自到现场抓设计，抓工程进度，终于以惊人的速度完成了这项技术复杂的、重大的工程，大大提高了运输装车效率。一个有三十七年土木建筑经验的老施工员说：“这活儿在伪满至少得干两年；共产党领导，要没总路线，也得干一年；现在书记挂帅，有总路线、大跃进，也得半年。”结果不是半年，而是四十几天这项工程就全部竣工了。
        一竿子插到底
    一竿子插到底，是实现领导与群众高度密切结合的最有效的形式，对于推动各项任务的完成有着非常显著的效果。所谓“底”，就是广大群众，生产力当中最活跃、最积极的因素。党的领导这根“竿子”一直插到广大职工群众这个“底”，就会产生出巨大的物质力量，使党的号召迅速实现，使生产中存在的问题很快、很彻底地解决。从多次实践中，我们深深体会到，这是一种适应生产持续跃进新形势的高质、高效率的工作方法。
    我们用会议把一竿子插到底的方法加以制度化、经常化，在煤矿和铁路运输方面普遍推广。“一竿子插到底会议”的特点是：几个企业或几个工程单独解决不了的问题，开协作会解决问题；参加人员从市委书记、局长、党委书记、矿长、基层干部、技职人员到工人，包括了“三结合”的各个方面；人数不限，少者十几人，多者几百人；会议地点在现场，哪里是关键就在哪里开；跟班开会，不妨碍生产和工人休息；围绕一个中心，大鸣大放，事事有主，当场答复，当场决定。这种新型的会议很受工人和基层干部欢迎，他们说这是“鼓劲会”、“解疙瘩会”……。人们每逢感到问题多了，就说：“又得开一竿子插到底的会了。”干部、群众都把它当作是最解决问题的会，对它有着高度的信任。根据实际工作中的体会，我们认为它有以下三个好处：
    一、贯彻党的紧急指示及时、准确。过去贯彻党的紧急指示，一般都采取层层传达、逐级布置的方法，传达到工人那里，往往只剩下一句：“今天搞高产，大家好好干”。采取一竿子插到底的方法以后，市委书记、企业党委书记、行政领导干部，亲自到现场直接向工人讲形势、交任务，作传达动员报告。不仅又快、又准确，而且领导干部这种雷厉风行的战斗作风，对工人鼓舞很大，党的指示当场变成群众的誓言，紧接着就形成一个比干劲、比措施的热潮。平安矿一坑改变了过去层层布置的作法，创造了“三结合”群众性生产会议，班班都用一竿子插到底的方法制订生产计划。这个坑5月份实行“三结合”群众性生产会议以后，连月超产，到6月底便超额6％完成了全年计划的一半。
    二、解决问题又快又彻底。海州矿选后煤仓装车溜子口长，遇到大车皮就放不出去，需要割去一截。过去，工人对这个问题提过许多次意见也没有解决。在一竿子插到底会议上，工人又提了出来。我们问：“是谁的责任？”选煤厂厂长立刻站起来向群众说：“今天晚上就解决！”但第二天工人又提意见说：“割是割了，可是割的不够，还过不去车。”于是当天又割了一次，彻底解决了问题。诸如此类的情况，对工人和干部都有很大教育意义。工人当面锣、对面鼓地和市委书记等领导干部谈问题、想措施，提了意见马上有答复、有着落，感到自己又是生产者又是管理者，心情舒畅，干劲倍增。干部在群众面前答复问题，实际上形成一种群众监督，都千方百计尽快解决自己答应解决的问题。坚持开这样的会，对干部改善作风是个很大的促进。
    三、有些问题很复杂，一时摸不着底，就召集各有关环节的工人和基层干部参加，“三头对案”开展大辩论，很快就会水落石出。阜新车站有一个时期配车、装车、开车都没问题，但是一次作业时间仍然很长。在各个有关方面的一竿子插到底会上，工人说：“不把拦路虎赶走，一次作业时间就别想短。”“拦路虎”指的是九号扳道房，那里离指挥部远，领导照顾不到，经常发生别车现象。会后指挥部立刻派干部去加强领导，“拦路虎”变成了“协作站”，别车问题很快就解决了。
    为什么一竿子插到底的方法会有这么大的作用？原因就是领导的积极性与群众的积极性，通过一竿子插到底会议达到了高度的结合。有个干部说得好：“一个干部抓一百把，也只是百把而已。干部工人一齐抓，一抓就是千把万把，解决问题还有不快的！”
    大种“试验田”以点带动面
    大跃进以来，我们经常采取两种形式来运用以点带面的工作方法。一种是：每当一项中心任务布置下去以后，便组织检查团深入生产前线巡回检查，另一种就是种“试验田”。检查团由市委书记挂帅，组织各机关领导干部参加，哪里发现问题，就在哪里帮助解决；哪里发现经验，就在哪里召开现场会议总结推广，既走马观花，也下马观花。攉煤机械化、土煤气化、生产联动化等技术革新项目，就是在检查团的促进下几天之内在全市普遍推广的。1958年，党中央提出在各方面普遍推行种
  “试验田”经验的号召后，市委主要领导干部和各厂矿领导干部，都建立了自己的“试验田”，并保持经常固定的联系。仅据全矿区三个矿的统计，矿一级领导干部的“试验田”便有十八块。“田”里的工人、基层干部，都以领导干部在自己这里参加劳动为荣，千方百计地“不给领导丢脸”。领导干部也都踏踏实实地在“试验田”参加生产，帮助“试验田”贯彻执行党的方针政策，研究和解决生产中的具体问题，摸索新的经验。大部“试验田”都是“高产田”，水力运输、近距离排土、铁路运输上的路矿协作等重大经验，都是“试验田”里的产物。
    深入重点种“试验田”，会不会妨碍指导全面？这要看用什么来指导全面，是用来自主观的东西，还是用来自群众在生产实践中创造的活生生的经验？事实证明：“任何领导人员，凡不从下级个别单位的个别人员、个别事件取得具体经验者，必不能向一切单位作普遍的指导。”（毛泽东：《关于领导方法的若干问题》）反之，凡是深入到生产中去，深入到群众中去，就会发现许多对生产发展具有巨大促进意义的新事物。我们在平安矿五坑第三采煤段种“试验田”时，就发现了这样一个新事物。有一个送上山的掘进工作面，因为缺少运煤溜子将要停工。同时，这个掘进工作面上部的巷道里存有积水，经常流过工作面，把煤炭冲跑了不少。工人就想出一个办法，干脆不要溜子，打眼放炮后就放出巷道里的水来冲煤，结果反倒比用溜子运煤还提高效率80％。工人的创造，给了我们一个极重要的启示：采煤工作面溜子故障多，是提高产量最突出的薄弱环节，能不能把掘进工作面利用水力运煤的做法，推广到采煤工作面上去？我们在“试验田”里和工人们商量以后立刻开始试验，终于创造出一整套从设备安装、采区设计到井下脱水的水力运输经验，使这个薄煤层的月产量，由原来的三、四千吨提高到七、八千吨。抓住了这个从个别单位的个别事件中取得的具体经验，我们向平安矿提出普遍推广水力运输经验，实行全面技术改革的口号。新事物在党的支持和培育下，成长壮大起来，水力运输不仅在五坑三段坚持了下来，并且在平安矿80％的工作面上得到推广。今年又发展成为一种以水力运输为中心的新采煤法，有力地促进了生产跃进。平安矿二坑六段推行新采煤法以后，平均日产量由原来的三、四百吨左右，提高到一千吨左右；水力运输的发源地——五坑三段6月份创造了薄煤层月产一万八千八百二十吨的全矿区新纪录。
    实践证明，指导全面工作必须以重点深入取得的经验为基础，而在指导全面的过程中，仍然要继续深入到新的重点中去，具体解决在推广中出现的新问题。如此循环往复，就会使我们的领导工作始终是比较符合客观实际，而不会犯主观主义的错误，犯了也能及时纠正。因此，1958年以来，我们一直坚持并发展了种“试验田”的经验。哪里是生产关键，就在哪里种“试验田”；哪里出现新事物的萌芽，就在哪里种“试验田”。“试验田”成为我们经常深入生产第一线的“基地”、联系群众的“基地”、培育新事物的“基地”。通过种“试验田”的方法，具体地贯彻毛主席教导我们的一般与个别相结合的工作方法，推动生产不断跃进。
    领导作风的改善和领导方法的改进，也是一个思想革命的过程。“从群众中来，到群众中去”这种工作方法，不仅是马克思主义的科学的认识论的产物，而且是与艰苦朴素的作风密切联系着的。要从群众中来，首先必须到群众活动的生产第一线去。我们提倡这样做，不可避免地便要同有些同志身上的主观主义或好逸恶劳的习气发生矛盾，展开斗争。这种斗争，实质上是辩证唯物主义的世界观与唯心主义的世界观的斗争，是朝气勃勃的无产阶级的世界观与暮气沉沉的懦夫、懒汉的世界观的斗争。改善领导作风的过程，也是一个思想改造的过程。因此，我们在号召干部改善领导作风当中，始终注意加强政治思想工作。
    领导作风、领导方法是上层建筑的一部分。生产关系必须适应生产力的发展，上层建筑必须适应经济基础的需要。只有根据不断革命的精神，调整和改善生产关系和上层建筑，才能不断地为生产力的持续跃进开辟道路。从这一原则来检查我们的领导作风和领导方法，还存在着一些问题。这些问题主要是，有些同志深入第一线，还存在着形式主义的作风，只走马观花，不解决问题；有些领导方法上的新经验、新问题及时总结不够，等等。我们要继续努力，不断地改进领导作风、改进领导方法，更加充分地调动起广大群众的积极性、创造性，促进生产力更大跃进。（原载《辽宁日报》本报有删节）
