    Class Brothers, We Are With You
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhen Weimin, Tong Guohua, Liaoning Daily Reporter Wu Wen
    August 9th was a clear and bright morning. Ren Zhiyuan, First Secretary of the CPC Benxi Municipal Committee, Zhang Yunlong, Mayor of Benxi, Wang Shubin, Secretary of the Municipal Youth League Committee, and others met with five worker comrades including Long Huaiwang and Hu Yukun. They are ordinary workers, but heroes who forgot themselves to save others! Just a few days before, when Benxi City suffered a major flood disaster, they took the lead in driving a rubber boat to conquer the raging torrents, crossed the hundred-meter-wide river, erected a life-saving rope, and rescued two hundred and seventy-seven class brothers who were trapped by the flood. However, these five people are only representatives of those who participated in this rescue battle, not all the heroic figures in the rescue. Now, let's start from the beginning!
    A Group of People Who Love National Property
    On the night of August 3rd, a torrential rain poured down on Benxi, and the Taizi River roared, with flood peaks rising more than ten feet high and cascading down. A small village, Caitun, located along the river, was surrounded by floods. The Benxi Municipal Meat聯合联合 Processing Factory and an office of the Xinsheng Heavy Machinery Factory are located in this small village.
    At this quiet time of night, with floods blocking the door, it would have been very dangerous, but none of the people here left. They were carrying wood to higher ground, driving pigs up the mountain, determined to transport the state's property to a safe place to prevent any eventuality. Just as they were moving a lot of state property to higher ground and had almost driven more than 1,700 pigs away, the floodwater was already knee-deep. At this time, Zhang Yongtian, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Municipal Food Company, Deputy Manager Lin Yuchun, and Zhang Qiyou, Director of the Processing Plant, mobilized and organized everyone to rush up the mountain, but they were blocked by the flood several times. The water rose from their knees to their thighs, and in an instant, the water flooded the houses. They were surrounded by the flood. This group of people who bravely rescued state property, under the organization of the factory director and the Party committee secretary, climbed onto the roof along the ladder.
    Let Us Be With You
    The morning of the 4th arrived! It was a cloudy, rainy, and slowly dawning day.
    The vigilant people of Benxi got up earlier today than usual. Responding to the emergency flood prevention call issued by the Municipal Party Committee, they rushed to various places where danger might occur.
    Shi Yongxin, Deputy Manager of the Food Company, led dozens of people through the rain toward Caitun. The raging flood cut off the road to Caitun. He watched more than two hundred brothers across the river suffering, his heart was burning. This strong man, who had crossed the Yalu River many times, became determined, threw off his jacket, and jumped into the rapids. But he only swam a dozen meters before the frantic waves pushed him back to the bank. He changed places for the second attempt, but it still didn't work.
    As he was catching his breath by the weir, preparing to jump into the water again to try and cross, Zhang Jichen, Deputy Secretary of the Commercial Party Committee, arrived and grabbed him: "Old Shi, don't jump again, people must be saved, we'll find a way!" They studied for a while and decided to float logs from upstream, but twice in a row, the logs were either overturned or pushed to the side by the waves!
    The news quickly spread to the Municipal Party Committee. All five secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee and the members of the Standing Committee came to the scene. The Municipal Party Committee immediately decided to mobilize all forces to rescue, and a frontline rescue headquarters was set up at the bridgehead. Before long, the Caitun Coal Mine commando team arrived! The Party and government organ commando team arrived! The swimming athlete team of the Sports Commission arrived... Four or five thousand people gathered at the weir and the bridgehead. The frontline headquarters immediately selected strong young men to form a commando team to cross the river and rescue.
    After 7:00 a.m., the water level of the Taizi River rose even higher. The water was less than a foot away from the eaves of the flooded houses in Caitun. At this time, the comrades who were crossing the river to rescue had rushed several times against the rapids, but they hadn't made it across. Floating logs and tires failed time and time again. Someone suggested releasing ropes, but a rope as thick as a child's arm was broken by the flood before it could reach a hundred meters. By 1:00 p.m., the water level reached its peak, less than half a foot from the eaves. The city had tried all the methods it could think of, but still couldn't rescue the people.
    The Municipal Party Committee decided to seek help from the Provincial Party Committee and the Central Committee. Telegrams were sent and phone calls were made. The Provincial Party Committee replied: Dispatch planes immediately! Please prepare to receive the airborne rescue equipment! And these planes were precisely those that had come from Beijing this morning, from Chairman Mao! They brought the care of the Party and the people of the whole country.
    The first plane appeared. The personnel in charge of telephone contact reported that there were three provincial party committee secretaries on the plane. The municipal party committee immediately told the brothers in distress more than one hundred meters away on the other side of the river by shouting. The plane circled at low altitude three times. When the plane flew over the isolated island - the three high houses in Caitun, the trapped people cheered. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party!" echoed from both sides, overwhelming the flood and being heard by each other.
    The second plane followed. From the ground, the cabin door opened, and lifebuoys and rubber boats accurately landed at the drop point. As the third plane flew away, darkness descended again on Benxi City.
    At this time, the sky was still gloomy. The people on the shore could not see the brothers trapped on the three "isolated islands" on the other side, but the "islands" were not silent. The sound of "Socialism is good" faintly reached this shore. Then the singing also started on another house; the people on the third house sang "Revolutionary People", and finally they repeatedly sang "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China".
    How optimistic are these heroes who have put themselves in danger to save state property!
    When it got dark, Zhang Yongtian, Lin Yuchun and other five Communist Party members who stayed on the "isolated island", in order to prevent everyone from falling into the water while sleeping, and also to let the people on the opposite side know where they were and reassure the people on the other side, took the lead in singing. The singing became higher and higher, and more and more excited. "The revolutionary is a hero, no difficulty can stop us..." These lyrics are the portrayal of these heroes.
    The First Boat to Cross the Rapids
    Midnight passed, and a new dawn—August 5th—had begun its first quarter of an hour. At this time, the side of the railway was filled with people. People held their breath, and hundreds of thousands of eyes stared at a rubber boat breaking through the waves. The head of the boat crew, construction worker Long Huaiwang, and Communist Youth League member and hydraulic press worker Hu Yukun, held the oars tightly and rowed forward rhythmically, one meter, five meters, ten meters. A flood peak suddenly rushed toward the boat, and the boat was pushed back.
    "Old Hu, rush past, victory is after the rapids!"
    "Yes, you steer well, exert effort, one, two, three..." They fought with the flood like this for many rounds, and finally broke through this rapid.
    Someone shouted: "The boat is ashore!" Instantly, thunderous applause rang out on both sides.
    Before the boat could land, Long Huaiwang and Hu Yukun jumped ashore. Immediately afterwards, the third and fourth sailors landed. They couldn't wait to run to the houses surrounded by the flood, carrying people off the roof onto the boat.
    The boat was full. Hu Yukun stayed on the other side to take care of the surrounded people, and Long Huaiwang and others sailed the boat toward this shore. They quickly passed the middle of the stream, but unexpectedly, as the boat was about to land, a sudden wave caused the boat to capsize, and an old man and a woman fell into the water! The boat was also hit by the rapid waves into the bridge pier forty meters away!
    At this critical moment, Long Huaiwang and the falling old man and woman simultaneously grabbed the several large nets and dozens of ropes that had already been cast down from the bridge. The resourceful and brave Long Huaiwang quickly tied the rope to the stern of the boat and turned around to rescue the old man and woman. Almost at the same time, Hu Yukun, who was responsible for carrying the disaster victims over there, heard a cry for rescue on the other side, immediately jumped into the rapids, swam over, boarded the small boat, and drove the boat with Long Huaiwang. With the help of the people on the shore, the boat safely landed, and the first boat rescued nine lives.
    Cleverly Erecting a Lifeline
    Based on the experience of the first boat, ensuring the safe crossing of the boats became the primary issue. Wang Shubin, the commander of the frontline rescue headquarters and secretary of the Municipal Youth League Committee, immediately convened a meeting with the sailors on the first boat to study the matter. People decisively decided: bring the rope to the other side of the river, erect a rope horizontally on the river, and the boat can travel back and forth along the rope to ensure safety.
    Shi Yongxin, Deputy Manager of the Municipal Food Company, heard that ropes were to be erected, and as a Communist Party member, he repeatedly requested a responsible comrade of the Municipal Party Committee that he wanted to personally send the rope to the other side. The Municipal Party Committee, considering that the Party leadership needed to be strengthened on the boat, agreed. At this time, a rope more than one hundred and twenty meters long was tied at one end to the rails on the shore and at the other end to the boat. Shi Yongxin, Long Huaiwang, Hu Yukun and others drove the boat to the other side. However, due to the rope tied to the boat being impacted by the flood, the resistance was very large, dragging the boat not only could not move forward quickly, but also was in danger of being overturned at any time. At this time, they had to drive the boat back and think of other ways.
    After research, they decided to put the rope on the boat and take it over, tie it to the other shore, and then have someone from the other side float the rope over; this shore would then send another person, tied with a safety rope around their waist, to float to the center of the river, and bring the person from the other side together with the rope. With the method in place, Shi Yongxin, Long Huaiwang, Hu Yukun and others immediately drove the boat over. When they sent a young man from the other side to float the rope to this shore, young riveter Feng Guangting on this shore also took a lifebuoy, tied a rope around his waist, and jumped into the water, swimming towards the other side. As he was making a great effort to move forward, a huge wave more than ten feet high suddenly knocked him down, and the situation was quite critical. At this time, the people on the shore saw that the situation was not good and pulled the rope back three or four meters. Coincidentally, at this critical moment, Feng Guangting wittily grabbed the person who came from the opposite side to send the rope. In this way, a "lifeline" was connected.
    The Party Gave Us Life
    The news that the "lifeline" was connected quickly spread to the roof, and at this time, many trapped people shed tears of excitement and gratitude. Someone, excitedly shouted: "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Then everyone cheered in unison.
    Shi Yongxin put a basket of biscuits in front of everyone. An old worker said: "This basket of biscuits represents the care of the Party and the country for us."
    Shi Yongxin went to the roof, and he also reunited with Manager Lin, Secretary Zhang, and Director Zhang. Meeting again on this occasion, the deep class feeling made them feel closer than brothers. They jointly organized to divide the trapped members into more than thirty batches, and more than twenty sailors, including Long Huaiwang and Hu Yukun, drove four rubber boats, one trip after another, along the life-saving rope, and sent them safely across the river. After three hours of cyclical operation, by 4:00 a.m. on the 5th, before dawn, two hundred and seventy-seven class brothers were all safely rescued.
    After getting off the boat, everyone ate the soda and biscuits that had been prepared in advance. All the physically weak people entered the emergency station on the bridgehead, and the sick were transferred to the hospital.
    After the dark clouds passed, there was a clear sky again. When Deputy Managers Shi and Lin of the Food Company went to the hospital to visit, Zhang Chunxiang, an old and frail manure-carrying worker who was recuperating in the hospital, held the manager's hand and said: "Manager! Please say a word for me, let the doctor allow me to go back early. Don't look down on me as an old man, I still want to work hard for communism for another sixty years to repay my re-born parents - the Communist Party."

    阶级兄弟，我们和你们在一起
    新华社记者　甄为民　童国华　辽宁日报记者　伍文
    8月9日，一个晴朗的早晨。中共本溪市委第一书记任志远、本溪市长章云龙、团市委书记王树彬等人，在市体育宫接见了龙怀旺、胡玉坤等五位工人同志，他们是平凡的工人，又是为抢救别人而忘却自己的英雄！就在几天以前，本溪市发生特大洪水灾害的时候，他们曾经首驾橡皮船战胜激流，强渡百米宽的大河，架起一根救命索，挽救了被洪水围困的二百七十七名阶级兄弟。然而，这五个人只是参加这场抢救战斗的代表，并不是抢救中的全部英雄人物。现在，让我们从头说起吧！
    一群爱护国家财产的人们
    8月3日黑夜，本溪上空暴雨如注，太子河咆哮了，河水腾起一丈多高的洪峰，哗哗下泻。就在这条河沿边上的一个小屯——彩屯被洪水包围了。在这个小屯中，有本溪市的肉类联合加工厂和新生重型机械厂的一个办公室。
    在这夜深人静的时候，洪水封门，本来是很危险的，可是，这里的人们一个也没有走开。他们正在扛木材上高地，赶猪上山，决心要把国家的财物运到安全地带，以防万一。正当他们把许多国家财产搬到高地，把一千七百多头猪赶得差不多的时候，洪水已经没膝了。这时，市食品公司党委书记张永田、副经理林玉春和加工厂厂长张启有，动员和组织大家向山上冲，但是冲了几次，都被洪水挡了回来。水从他们膝盖涌上了大腿，在一瞬间水又淹没了房子。他们被洪水包围了。这群英勇抢救国家资财的人们在厂长、党委书记的组织下，沿着梯子，爬上了房顶。
    让我们和你们在一起
    4日清晨来到了！这是一个乌云蔽天，大雨滂沱的迟迟降临的黎明。
    警惕的本溪市人民今天比已往都起得早，他们响应市委发出的紧急防汛号召，涌向各个可能出险的地方。
    食品公司副经理石永新领着几十个人冒雨朝彩屯跑去。汹涌的洪水隔断了去彩屯的道路。他眼看着河对岸二百多名亲兄弟受难，心如油煎，这个曾经多次横渡鸭绿江的壮年人，一发狠，上衣甩出多远，跃身跳入急流。但他只游出十几米远，疯狂的巨浪又把他打回到堰边，第二次他换了一个地方，仍然不行。
    当他在堰边正喘一口气准备再跳水抢渡的时候，商业党委副书记张吉臣赶到了，一把抓住了他：“老石，不准再跳，人一定要救，我们想办法！”他们研究一阵，决定从上流放木排，可是，一连两次，木排不是被打翻了，就是被浪顶到一边去了！
    消息迅速的传到了市委，市委五位书记和市委常委同志全部来到了现场。市委立即决定，动员一切力量抢救，并且在桥头上成立了前线抢救指挥部。不一会，彩屯煤矿突击队来了！党群机关突击队来了！体委的游泳运动员队伍来了……。堰边，铁桥头上，聚集了四、五千人。前线指挥部立即挑选身强力壮的小伙子，组成突击队，强渡抢救。
    上午七时以后，太子河水位涨得更高了。河水已经离彩屯被淹房屋的房沿不到一尺了。这时，渡河抢救的同志，已经顶着急流冲了几次，但都没过去；放木排，放轮带，一次又一次地也失败了。有人提议放绳子，但是一根有小孩胳膀粗的绳子，没放出一百米，就被洪水冲断了。到下午一时水位达到最高峰，离房沿只有不足半尺高，市里能想的办法都想到了，试过了，但是仍然不能救出人来。
    市委决定向省委求救，向中央求救，电报发出去了，电话也打通了。省委回话说：立即派飞机！请市里准备接受空投的抢险器材！而这些飞机正是今晨从北京来的，是从毛主席那里来的！他带来了党和全国人民的关怀。
    第一架飞机出现了，负责电话联系的人员报告说，在飞机上有三位省委书记。市委立即把这一消息用喊话，告诉了对岸一百多米之外的受难弟兄，飞机低空盘旋了三圈，当飞机飞临孤岛——彩屯三座高房的上空时，被困的人们欢腾起来。从两岸响起的“毛主席万岁！”“共产党万岁！”的欢呼声，压倒了洪涛，互相可以听到。
    第二架飞机跟着出现了。从地面上看，机舱门打开了，救生圈、橡皮船准确地落在了空投点。当第三架飞机飞去时，黑夜又降临到本溪市。
    这时，天空仍然是阴沉沉地。岸上的人们看不见对岸困在三个“孤岛”上的兄弟了，然而，“岛”上并没有沉寂。一阵“社会主义好”的歌声隐隐传到了这岸。接着另一个房子上也响起了歌声；第三个房子上的人唱起了“革命人”，最后他们又反复地唱着“没有共产党就没有新中国”。
    这些为了抢救国家财产而使自己陷于危险境地的英雄们，是多么的乐观啊！
    当天色黑下来的时候，留在“孤岛”上的张永田、林玉春等五个共产党员，为了预防大家睡觉落水，也为了让对面的人知道他们在什么地方，使对岸人放心，他们带头唱起了歌，这歌声越唱越高吭，越唱越兴奋。“革命人是好汉，任何艰险无阻拦，……”这歌词正是这些英雄们的写照。
    强渡急流第一船
    午夜过去了，一个新的黎明——8月5号，已经开始了它的第一刻钟。这时，铁道边上站满了人，人们屏住气，成千上万只的眼睛盯着冲破巨浪划出去的一只橡皮船。水手组长、建筑工人龙怀旺和共青团员、水压机工人胡玉坤，紧把着桨，有节奏地向前划去，一米、五米、十米，一个洪峰突然向船扑来，船被推回来了。
    “老胡，冲过去，过了急流就是胜利！”
    “是，你掌好舵，使劲，一、二、三……”他们就这样和洪水搏斗许多个回合，终于冲破了这股急流。
    不知谁喊了一声：“船靠岸啦！”顿时，两岸响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    还没等船靠岸，龙怀旺和胡玉坤就跳上岸了。紧接着，第三、第四名水手都上岸了。他们迫不及待地向被洪水围困的房屋奔去，从房顶上往下背人上船。
    船满员了。胡玉坤留在对岸照护被围的人，龙怀旺等人驾船向这岸驶来，很快地过了中流，但出人意外，当船快靠岸时，一个急浪，船一颠簸，一位老汉和一个妇女掉到水里去了。船也被急浪打到四十米外的桥墩中去！
    在这个危急的时刻，只见龙怀旺和落水的老人和妇女，同时抓住了桥上早已撒下的几面大网和数十条绳索。机智勇敢的龙怀旺，迅速的把绳子拴在船尾上，就连忙转过身去救起落水的老人和妇女。几乎在同一时间，正在那边负责背灾民的胡玉坤，听到对岸一片抢救声，立即跳入急流，游了过来，登上小船，和龙怀旺一齐驾船。在岸上人们的帮助下，船平安地靠岸了，第一船救出了九条生命。
    巧架一条生命线
    根据第一船的经验，保证船只安全渡河成了首要问题了。前线抢救指挥部指挥员、团市委书记王树彬立即召集第一艘船上的水手们开会研究，人们当机立断的决定：把绳子带到河对岸去，在河上横架一条绳索，船沿绳索往返，就可以保证安全。
    市食品公司副经理石永新听说要架绳索，他以一个共产党员的身分几次向市委一个负责同志请求，他要亲自把绳子送到对岸去。市委考虑到船上需要加强党的领导，就同意了。这时，一条一百二十多米长的绳子，一头拴在岸上的铁轨上，一头拴在船上。石永新、龙怀旺、胡玉坤等人驾船向对岸开去。但是，由于拴在船上的绳子，受洪水冲击，阻力很大，拖着船不仅不能迅速前进，而且随时有被拖翻的危险。这时，他们只好把船开回来，另想办法。
    经过研究，他们决定把绳子放在船上带过去，拴在那岸，然后再由对岸派人浮水把绳子拖过来；这岸再派一个人，腰中系上保险绳，浮往河心，把对岸来的人连同绳子一齐接过来。办法有了，石永新、龙怀旺、胡玉坤等人立即驾船过去。当他们在对岸派一个小伙子往这岸浮水拖绳时，青年铆工冯广廷在这岸也拿了一个救生圈，腰中系上绳子跳进水里，向对岸游去。他正在奋力前进的时候，一个足有一丈多高的巨浪把他猛地一下打下去了，情势相当危急。这时，岸上的人见势不妙，把绳子往后拉了三、四米，事有凑巧，就在这千钧一发的时候，冯广廷机智地顺手拉住了对面过来送绳子的人。就这样，一条“生命线”接上了。
    党给了我们生命
    “生命线”架通了的消息，迅速地传到了屋顶上，这时，许多被困的人们流下了兴奋和感激的眼泪。不知是谁，激动地高呼：“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”接着大家都不约而同的欢呼起来。
    石永新在大伙儿面前，放了一筐子饼干，一个老工人说：“这一篮子饼干，代表了党和国家对我们的关心”。
    石永新走上屋顶，他又和林经理、张书记、张厂长汇合了，在这个场合，再次相逢，深厚的阶级感情，使他们感到比亲兄弟还亲，他们共同组织，把被困成员分成三十多批，由龙怀旺、胡玉坤等二十多名水手，驾驶着四只橡皮船，一趟一趟的沿着那条救命绳索，平稳的送过河去。经过三个小时的循环作业，到5日上午四时，天亮以前，二百七十七名阶级兄弟全部安全脱险了。
    下船以后，所有的人都吃上了早已准备好的汽水和饼干，所有身体衰弱的人全部进了桥头上的急救站，有病的人转入了医院。
    乌云过去又是晴空，当食品公司石、林两位副经理去医院访问的时候，在医院休养的年老体衰的拉粪工人张春祥，双手拉着经理的手说：“经理呀！你替我老头说句话，让大夫准我早回去，别看我是个老人，我还要使劲为共产主义再干它六十年，来报答我的再生父母——共产党。”
