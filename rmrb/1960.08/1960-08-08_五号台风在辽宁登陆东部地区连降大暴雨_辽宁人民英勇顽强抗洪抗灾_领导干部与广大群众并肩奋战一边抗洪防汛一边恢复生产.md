Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 7th: The people of the urban and rural areas centered around Fushun, Benxi, and Liaoyang in eastern Liaoning, which have been hit by extraordinarily severe floods, are launching a heroic and tenacious struggle against the floods and disasters under the strong leadership of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Party organizations at all levels, and with the support of the people from all regions. Leading cadres at all levels in the Liaoning Province Party, government, and military have all gone deep into the front lines of the flood fight, leading the broad masses to simultaneously combat floods and strive to resume production.

The extraordinary floods that occurred in these areas this time are unprecedented in history. Due to the impact of Pacific Typhoon No. 5 landing on the Liaodong Peninsula at the end of July, the eastern region centered around Fushun, Benxi, and Liaoyang experienced continuous torrential rains from August 1st to 5th. In Fushun City, the rainfall reached more than 180 millimeters in six or seven hours on the afternoon of August 1st, and torrential rains continued on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, making it a rainstorm attack unprecedented in Fushun for decades. The center of the rainstorm gradually shifted southward from Fushun to the Benxi and Liaoyang areas, and the intensity of the rainstorm also gradually increased. Due to the heavy and concentrated rainfall, the water levels of the Hun River and the Taizi River, tributaries of the Liao River, rose sharply, and flood peaks appeared successively. At 6:00 PM on August 4th, the flood peak water level at the Liaoyang station of the Taizi River rose to 27.94 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by more than three meters; the peak flow reached 17,000 cubic meters per second, exceeding the maximum flood peak flow of 10,400 cubic meters per second recorded in 1935 since hydrological records began. At 9:00 AM on August 4th, the flood peak water level at the Fushun station of the Hun River reached 77.11 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by nearly one meter. Thanks to the water conservancy projects that had been built, which played a certain role in intercepting and storing floodwaters, the peak flow was reduced from about 9,000 cubic meters per second to about 2,200 cubic meters per second. At the same time, continuous torrential rains also fell in the Andong area, and the water level of the Yuan River also rose sharply, greatly exceeding the highest water level in history.

Due to the outbreak of mountain floods and the sharp rise of river water, some crops and villages along the Hun River, Taizi River, and other rivers were flooded, and a small number of industrial and mining enterprises were also affected by the floods, which seriously affected the normal progress of production. On the railways in the rainstorm areas, some sections were broken, and traffic was temporarily suspended.

After the disaster occurred, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an emergency meeting on the morning of August 4th to deploy flood control and disaster relief work. Huang Oudong, Second Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, personally took charge of directing the province's flood prevention and disaster relief work. Zhang Zhengde, Commander-in-Chief of the Provincial Flood Control Headquarters and Deputy Governor, rushed to the critical sections of the upper reaches of the Hun River in Fushun City that night to direct the flood control and disaster relief struggle. On the 4th, 5th, and 6th, the province dispatched aircraft to airdrop a large amount of food and disaster relief supplies to the disaster-stricken areas of Benxi and Liaoyang. Leading cadres from relevant central departments also came to Liaoning to inspect and assist in guiding the flood prevention and disaster relief struggle, and transported a large number of emergency supplies, greatly boosting the confidence of the people in the disaster areas to overcome the disaster.

Party and government leaders in Fushun, Benxi, Anshan, Liaoyang, and other places went to wherever there was danger to fight alongside the masses and direct the flood control and disaster relief struggle. Shen Yue, First Secretary of the Fushun Municipal Party Committee, and others have been staying with the masses day and night for days, braving the rain to guard key flood control areas. On August 2nd, the Shangsi Reservoir in the Hebei Commune of the suburbs was in emergency. Wang Huaiyi, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and more than 2,000 people stood in waist-deep water and fought hard for three days and nights, finally completing the task of raising the dam and building a new spillway, turning the reservoir from danger to safety and protecting many important factories from flood attacks. The Laohutai Coal Mine in this city experienced five emergencies on the night of August 1st. Rong Weifu, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, took the lead in carrying sandbags weighing 100 kilograms and fought with the flood prevention personnel to build two waterproof dikes at the pit entrance within one hour, ensuring coal production. The commune members of the rural people's communes on the front line of flood control and rescue put forward the slogan "For every inch the water rises, the dike will be built one foot higher," and rushed to build dikes. The officers and soldiers of the local garrison also rushed to the front line of the flood control struggle to rescue and relieve disasters together with the masses.

Shenyang City, located in the lower reaches of the Hun River and not in the center of the rainstorm area, mobilized 100,000 rescue teams to bravely fight on the Hun River Dam in the face of wind and rain to prevent the Hun River floods from attacking. From the evening of the 4th to the evening of the 5th, in one day and night, they raised the 23-kilometer-long Hun River Dam from Maguanqiao to the Shenyang-Dalian line by one meter.

In the flood control struggle, all regions displayed a high degree of communist spirit. After learning that Liaoyang and other places were hit by rainstorms, Dalian City immediately organized rescue teams and medical teams, led by responsible cadres, to go to the disaster-stricken areas to assist in the rescue; at the same time, 300 ships and some food and materials were transferred to the disaster areas. Jinzhou and Yingkou Cities supported Liaoyang and Benxi Cities with eighty ships and some flood control equipment, food, etc., which were also successively transported to the disaster areas. Jiao Ruoyu, First Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee, and Secretary Wu Tieming personally led a rescue team on the 5th, carrying a large number of biscuits, grain, etc., and rushed to the neighboring area of the Dengta Commune in Liaoyang City to support disaster relief work.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the flood control struggle and industrial and agricultural production, Party committees at all levels adopted a leadership method of grasping flood prevention with one hand and grasping production with the other, and established two headquarters for flood prevention and production from top to bottom, so that flood prevention and production were closely integrated and promoted each other. Some factories, enterprises, and rural areas that have been harmed by floods are actively organizing to resume production after controlling the floods.

    五号台风在辽宁登陆东部地区连降大暴雨
    辽宁人民英勇顽强抗洪抗灾
    领导干部与广大群众并肩奋战一边抗洪防汛一边恢复生产
    新华社沈阳7日电　遭受特大洪水袭击的以抚顺、本溪、辽阳为中心的辽宁东部地区城乡人民，在中共辽宁省委和各级党组织的坚强领导和各地人民支援下，展开了英勇顽强的抗洪抗灾斗争。辽宁省党政军各级领导干部，都深入抗洪第一线，领导广大群众一边抗洪防汛，一边奋力恢复生产。
    这些地区这次发生的特大洪水是历史上从未有过的。由于7月底太平洋第五号台风在辽东半岛登陆的影响，以抚顺、本溪、辽阳为中心的东部地区自8月1日起至5日连降大暴雨。抚顺市在1日下午的六、七小时内降雨量即达一百八十多毫米，2日、3日、4日又连降暴雨，成为抚顺地区几十年来所没有的一次暴雨袭击。暴雨中心由抚顺逐步南移到本溪、辽阳一带，暴雨强度也逐渐加大。由于暴雨既大又集中，辽河支流浑河、太子河等河流水位猛涨，相继出现洪峰。太子河辽阳站4日下午六时洪峰水位涨到二十七点九四米，超过保证水位三米多；洪峰流量达一万七千秒立方米，超过了有水文纪录以来1935年一万零四百秒立方米的最大洪峰流量。浑河抚顺站4日上午九时洪峰水位达七十七点一一米，超过保证水位近一米，由于已修的水利工程发挥了拦蓄洪水的一定作用，洪峰流量从九千秒立方米左右削减到二千二百秒立方米左右。同时，安东地区也连降暴雨，瑗河水位也猛涨，大大超过了历史上最高水位。
    由于山洪暴发，河水猛涨，浑河、太子河等河流沿河地区部分庄稼、村屯被淹，少数工矿企业也受到洪水侵袭，严重地影响到生产的正常进行。暴雨区的铁路，部分路断，暂时停止通车。
    灾情发生后，中共辽宁省委于4日上午召开了紧急会议，部署抗洪救灾工作。省委第二书记黄欧东亲自挂帅指挥全省防汛抗灾工作。省防汛指挥部总指挥、副省长张正德，当夜赶赴抚顺市浑河上游险要地段指挥防洪抗灾斗争。4、5、6三日，省里派出飞机向本溪、辽阳等受灾地区空投了大量食品和抗灾物资。中央有关部门的领导干部也到辽宁视察和协助指导防汛抗灾斗争，并且运来大批抢险物资，大大鼓舞了灾区群众战胜灾害的信心。
    抚顺、本溪、鞍山、辽阳等地党政领导人，那里有险情，他们就到那里和群众并肩作战指挥防洪抗灾斗争。抚顺市委第一书记沈越等连日来都和群众一起，通宵达旦，冒雨坚守重点防汛地区。郊区河北公社上寺水库2日告急，市委书记王怀义和两千多群众站在没腰深的水里，坚持奋战三昼夜，终于完成了加高堤坝的任务，又新修通了一个溢洪道，使水库转危为安，保护了许多重要工厂免受洪水的袭击。这个市的老虎台煤矿1日夜间发生五次险情，党委副书记荣维富带头扛起一百公斤重的沙袋，和防汛人员全力奋战，一小时内就在坑口垒起两道防水坝，保障了煤炭生产。在防洪抢险最前线的农村人民公社社员纷纷提出了“水涨一寸，堤筑一尺”的口号，赶筑堤防。各地驻军官兵，也开赴抗洪斗争最前线，同群众一起抢险救灾。
    处于浑河下游、不是暴雨中心地区的沈阳市，为了防止浑河洪水的袭击，出动了十万抢险队伍，冒着风雨，顽强地奋战在浑河大坝上。从4日晚上到5日晚上的一昼夜间，他们把从马官桥到沈（阳）大（连）线路二十三公里长的浑河大坝加高一米。
    在抗洪斗争中各地发挥了高度共产主义风格。旅大市得知辽阳等地暴雨成灾后，立即组织了抢险队和医疗队，由负责干部率领分赴受灾区协助抢险；同时抽调三百只船和一些食品、物资运往灾区。锦州、营口两市支援辽阳、本溪两市的八十只船和一些防汛器材、食品等，也都陆续运达灾区。沈阳市委第一书记焦若愚和书记吴铁鸣，5日亲自率领救护队，携带大批饼干、粮食等，赶赴友邻地区辽阳市灯塔公社，支援抗灾救灾工作。
    为了加强对防洪斗争和工农业生产的领导，各级党委采取了一手抓防汛，一手抓生产的领导方法，从上到下分别成立防汛和生产两个指挥部，使防汛、生产紧密结合，互相促进。有些遭受洪水危害的工厂企业和农村，在制住洪水之后，积极组织恢复生产。
