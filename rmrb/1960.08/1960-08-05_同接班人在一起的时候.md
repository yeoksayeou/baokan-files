    Under the Party's nurturing and guidance, I have been engaged in children's literature work and creation since liberation. I usually have opportunities to contact children in many ways, and I think I know a lot about the thoughts and lives of children after liberation. I also think I am doing enough to educate children about communist morality. But at that time, I mostly lived in big cities and also ran around schools and the countryside. However, whether in the countryside or in the city, I only understood the school side. As for children's social life and family life, my understanding was very superficial. Because I didn't pay attention to this aspect in my own thinking, it can be said that I didn't understand it. Even for children's school education, because I was limited to listening to classes in the classroom, or standing in the laboratory and playground to watch their activities, I had no idea what their inner activities were and what ideals they had. I didn't realize that I lacked a comprehensive and correct understanding of today's children, especially today's rural children, until I went to Zhejiang to live in depth.
    At the end of 1957, I responded to the Party's call and settled down in a mountainous area in Zhejiang. This was the first year of the great leap forward in the motherland's production and construction, and the first year that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the brilliant general line of socialist construction. It was a good opportunity for my own ideological transformation and life practice to be able to catch up with this time and participate in basic-level work in the countryside. Even if I had studied for ten years, I could not compare with this exercise of great significance. When I first arrived in Zhejiang, I worked as the deputy secretary of the township general branch in a mountain base. At that time, I thought it would be good to take on this job, so that I could fully understand the basic situation of the local area, and then go to a school and live with the children. This was my old way of doing things in the past, which had serious one-sidedness. In fact, my approach was wrong. I separated the social education and school education of children, and I was more inclined to the school education side, thinking that only by going to school could I understand and be familiar with the children. However, after I did the work of the township general branch, it just proved that this work could make me understand the children more comprehensively and deeply. The day after I took office, I went to a mountain ravine to build a reservoir. It was almost the Spring Festival, and the schools were on winter vacation. I saw many junior high school students and elementary school students helping out. I thought the teachers must have brought them. But when I asked, it wasn't the case. The teachers had all gone to the county for study. These children had all asked the production team to allow them to work, and they were assigned to the production team of their own village to do some work within their capabilities with their parents. I felt very fresh at the time, which showed that my understanding of children's participation in social labor was very insufficient.
    Does this mean that I have a full understanding of the thoughts and feelings of the children of this great era from now on? No, I am far from knowing them. This can only be said to be the beginning. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, cadres and commune members all started planting experimental fields. No one asked the children to plant, but the children did it themselves. They had no fertilizer, so they went to the mountains to cut tender firewood leaves and to the villages to pick up chicken manure. There was a Caijiaban production team where six children planted five minutes of early rice experimental field. The target they set was to have a yield of 500 jin per mu higher than that of Comrade Yu Maotang, the secretary of the township general branch, and they also put forward the conditions for a challenge competition. Comrade Yu Maotang was a 28-year-old youth. He saw the children's daring communist style and enthusiastically praised them. Then almost all the children in each production team started to work on experimental fields. At that time, I was also working in the township general branch. I did not see the universal significance of children's love for labor and conscious labor as clearly as Comrade Yu Maotang. Of course, my lack of knowledge of agricultural production was one reason, but the fundamental reason was still a matter of thinking. I did not clearly realize that knowledge of production struggles should be one of the main contents of children's learning.
    Later, I lived in the production team of Huanglu Village and jointly planted a sweet potato experimental field with five children, which further confirmed the children's enthusiasm and creative spirit in participating in production labor and social political life. We turned vines, weeded, and fertilized diligently, and the sweet potato seedlings grew particularly well. Later, it was found that there was a curly leaf worm disease on the sweet potato leaves. No suitable pesticide could be found. The children came up with the idea of spraying it with a liquid of 666 powder, but some old people said that if 666 powder was applied to the sweet potato leaves, the taste of the sweet potatoes would be bitter. The children still wanted to try it, and as a result, the curly leaf worms all died, and the taste of the harvested sweet potatoes was not bitter. The children of Huanglu Village not only actively participated in production labor, but also actively participated in social and political life. They were all very lively and liked to participate in the activities of adults. For example, when the production team held a meeting, the children had nothing to do at night, so they ran to listen. Whether it was discussing production issues or criticizing a certain commune member's wrong thoughts, adults wrote big-character posters and posted them, and they also wrote big-character posters and posted them, and wrote their own views and opinions very seriously. I once wrote a short story "Write a Big-Character Poster to Mom", which was inspired by this.
    In the countryside, one can see everywhere that children actively and voluntarily participate in social and political life, and are thus tempered. Therefore, every political movement carried out in the countryside, or the upsurge of a production upsurge, educates and tempers adults. Children also receive education and tempering. During the Great Steel Smelting, a pair of young brothers and sisters built a small charcoal kiln by themselves, and fired more than ten kilograms of charcoal to hand over to the commune for iron smelting. Although the amount was small, it showed how much they loved the collective interests! It is very moving that children have such a sense of ownership, give full play to their creative abilities, and want to serve the socialist construction of the motherland early. The children who grew up in the Mao Zedong era, although young, have great ambitions, and want to be successors to the socialist construction of the motherland as early as possible. Their participation in social and political life is together with adults, from which they are encouraged and influenced by adults, which is exactly what our children's literature workers should pay attention to. If we don't pay attention to these, but instead emphasize that children's literature only writes about children and only writes about trivial things around children, it will only have a poisonous effect on cultivating the communist moral character of our next generation.
    While living in depth, one important and fundamental issue that I often have to consider is the issue of transforming my own worldview. We must let children accept the influence of the proletarian worldview from an early age, and the author himself must first have a proletarian worldview. I remember once, it was the busy season for harvesting early rice and rushing to plant late rice. The elementary schools were all on agricultural vacation, so that the children could help the production team with some light work. A child did not participate in labor, but went to the stream to catch fish. When we came back from the field, we happened to see him. I admired him for chasing a few fat wild fish back and forth in the water, and he was even more energetic in catching them. But when the production team leader Wang Yinfang came over, he looked at the child catching fish and solemnly called the child up and enthusiastically and sincerely criticized him for his idea of not loving collective interests and not loving production labor. At that time, I was next to him, and I only felt my face burning. Although the production team leader did not criticize my attitude, his words criticizing the child hit my key point. This time he educated the child and also educated me. What Comrade Wang Yinfang considered first was that this child did not follow the school's regulations, left his classmates, did not participate in labor, and also affected the collective interests of the production team. And what I was first interested in was the scene of the child catching fish, which could be used as writing material in the future, but I forgot that to write works to educate children, I should first educate the child in front of me. This is a matter of position and point of view, and a matter of whether I have truly fulfilled my responsibility to educate children. That night, I thought about it myself, and I felt even more that if I wanted to write about the lives of rural children, it was simply impossible to just go to the village school to listen to classes. I still had to unswervingly and resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, go deep into the fiery actual struggle, study Marxism-Leninism, and work hard to transform my thoughts and feelings.
    When I lived in the home of an orphan in Huanglu Village, I got along with three children of different ages and realized that children have a correct understanding of real life and have a clear class stand, which also had a certain impact on the changes in my thoughts and feelings. Their family consisted of the sixteen-year-old brother Wang Hongyi, the fourteen-year-old sister Shuiying, and the eleven-year-old brother Hongyao. Although they lost their parents, their lives were guaranteed under the care of the senior agricultural cooperative, and their progress in learning agricultural technology was also made every day. Compared with their father's work as a beast of burden for the landlord's family before liberation, there was a difference between heaven and earth. In their hearts, there were deep thoughts and feelings of loving the Party, loving Chairman Mao, and loving socialism, because although they were young, they had a personal experience of the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao. Wang Hongyi became the little head of the family and was also very experienced in practical struggles. At the same time, he loved the cooperative as his home and took special care of the property of the production team. One evening, as it was getting darker and darker, Hongyao had not returned from watching the sheep for the production team, and Shuiying blamed the production team's sheep for running around and being difficult to watch, and cursed that these sheep might as well die sooner. At that time, I heard it and only criticized her a few words lightly, and did not solve her ideological problems. Her brother Hongyi jumped up when he heard this and said loudly: "You black-hearted ghost! Who do the sheep belong to? Whose money is it if they die? It's the cooperative's. You might as well die, why do you curse the cooperative's sheep?"
    These are truly words full of class feelings. Wang Hongyi did not easily let go even if his sister cursed the cooperative's sheep in order to protect the collective interests, while my criticism of his sister was not as resolute, powerful, and enthusiastic as his. This is exactly what I should think deeply about. In principle, my ability to recognize things should be higher than Hongyi's, but I lack the thought and feeling of loving the cooperative as my home. This point is so prominent in a sixteen-year-old child, which also proves that Chairman Mao's placement of the issue of the position of literary and art workers in the first place is absolutely true. I should first stand on the Party's position to look at problems. If I can always be aware of this, then my view of all problems should be to speak from the Party's position, and there should be no difference between me and a small commune member like Wang Hongyi who loves the cooperative as his home.
    Wang Hongyi's love for the cooperative as his home is also manifested in his love for labor. When transplanting late rice, he came back one night and told me with a smile that he had learned how to transplant rice, and he was even rated as having ten points during the work point assessment. I was also happy for him when I saw his happy mood. His sense of pride was still for the collective. He felt that he could contribute more to the cooperative and that he was almost like an adult. This was the reason why he felt happy and happy. His simple feelings also infected me, making me realize how much our next generation cares about the collective, and feels honored and happy to contribute one more point to the collective interests. When I thought of these things, I felt that I still needed to catch up, and this was the encouragement he gave me. I have seen some children's literary works that describe such large rural children as being playful and lacking knowledge of production struggles, not to mention the role that children play in class struggles. They emphasize "child-centeredness" and pursue "childlike interest", which is actually a serious distortion of children's real lives.
    Our next generation is an amazing next generation! The heroic achievements of the future have already sprouted now. Serving children is happy, and it is the glorious responsibility of our children's literature workers. Let us work harder for our communist successors under the shining banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

    同接班人在一起的时候	金近
    我在党的培养和教导下，解放以后专搞儿童文学工作和创作，平时也有机会和孩子们多方面的接触，自以为对解放后的孩子们的思想和生活是很了解的，自以为对孩子们进行共产主义道德品质教育也是比较够的。但那时候多半住在大城市里，也跑跑学校，跑跑农村，可是不论在农村和城市，都只了解到学校的一面，至于孩子们的社会生活和家庭生活，了解得很肤浅，由于自己思想上也不重视这一面，因此可以说是不了解。就是对孩子们的学校教育来说，因为只限于课堂里听听上课，或者站在实验室里和操场上看他们的活动，对于他们自己的内心活动和有些什么理想，我就心中无数。我发现自己对于今天的孩子们，特别是对今天农村的孩子们缺乏全面的、正确的了解，还是到浙江深入生活以后的事。
    1957年底，我响应党的号召，到浙江的一个山区里去落户，这是祖国生产建设大跃进的第一年，是党中央和毛主席提出光芒万丈的社会主义建设总路线的第一年，我能够赶上这个时候到农村参加基层工作，对我自己的思想改造和生活实践来说，真是个好机会，即使我读十年书，也根本比不上这个具有重大意义的锻炼。我刚到浙江，就在一个山区基层担任乡总支副书记的工作。当时我想，担任这工作也好，可以全面了解当地的基本情况，然后再到一个学校里去，和孩子们生活在一起。这是我过去的一套做法，是有严重片面性的“老办法”。其实我这种做法是错误的，我把向孩子们进行社会教育和学校教育分割开来看了，而且更偏重于学校教育这一面，认为要了解和熟悉孩子们，只有到学校里去才能办到。可是我做了乡总支工作以后，恰好证明我这个工作对了解孩子们可以做到更全面、更深入。我担任工作后的第二天，就到一个山岙里去修水库，那正是快到春节的时候，学校里放寒假，我看到有好多初中学生和小学生也在帮忙，我想这一定是学校里的老师带他们来的。可是一问，不是这么一回事，老师都到县里去学习了，这些孩子都是自己请求生产队允许他们来劳动的，他们就编在自己村的生产队里，和爸爸妈妈一块，做些力所能及的劳动。我当时觉得很新鲜，说明我对孩子们参加社会劳动的认识是很不够的。
    这是不是说，从此我对这个伟大时代的孩子们的思想感情有充分认识了呢？没有，我还远远没有认识他们。这只能说是开始。1958年大跃进，干部和社员都种起试验田来了，谁也没有要孩子们种，可是孩子们自己在搞起来啦，他们没有肥料，就到山上去割嫩柴叶，到村子里拣鸡粪。有个蔡家坂生产小队，那里的六个孩子种了五分早稻试验田。他们订的指标要比乡总支书记俞茂堂同志亩产高五百斤，还提出挑战竞赛的条件。俞茂堂同志是个二十八岁的青年，他看出了孩子们这种敢想敢做的共产主义风格，就热情地表扬了他们。接着几乎是各个生产队里的孩子都搞起试验田来了。当时我也在乡总支工作，我还没有像俞茂堂同志那样明快地看出孩子们身上的热爱劳动和自觉劳动的普遍意义。当然，我的农业生产知识少是个原因，但根本的原因还是个思想问题。我没有明确地认识到，生产斗争知识应该是孩子们学习的主要内容之一。
    后来，我住到皇路村的生产小队去，和五个孩子合种了一块番薯试验田，更证实了孩子们参加生产劳动和社会政治生活的积极性和创造精神。我们翻藤、除草、施肥，搞得很勤快，番薯秧也就长得特别好。后来发现番薯叶上有卷叶虫病，找不到适当的农药，孩子们想出用六六六粉液体来喷射，可是有几个老年人说，番薯叶上打了六六六粉，番薯的味道要苦的。孩子们还是要试一试，结果卷叶虫都死了，收获起来的番薯的味道并不苦。皇路村的孩子们不仅积极参加生产劳动，也积极参加社会政治生活。他们个个都很活泼，喜欢参加成年人的活动，比如开生产小队会，孩子们晚上没有事，就跑来听，不论是讨论生产的问题，或者批评某个社员的错误思想，成年人写大字报贴出来，他们也写大字报贴出来，而且很认真地写出了自己的看法和意见。我曾写过一个短篇小说《给妈妈写张大字报》，就是从这里得到启发的。
    在农村里，处处可以看到孩子们主动积极地参加社会政治生活，并且由此受到锻炼。因此农村里所开展的每一次政治运动，或者掀起一个生产高潮，成年人受到教育和锻炼。孩子们同样受到教育和锻炼。大炼钢铁的时候，有一对小兄妹，自己搭了一个小木炭窑，一窑烧出十多斤木炭来，交给公社炼铁。数目虽然小，却表现了他们多么爱护集体利益啊！孩子们这种以主人翁的态度自居，充分发挥创造能力，提早要为祖国建设社会主义服务，是很感动人的。生长在毛泽东时代的孩子们，年纪虽小，志气很大，正想提早做个祖国社会主义建设的接班人。他们参加社会政治生活，就是和成年人在一起，从中受到了成年人的鼓舞和影响，这一点正是我们儿童文学工作者要好好重视的。如果我们不重视这些，反而去强调儿童文学只写儿童，只写儿童身边琐事，那对于培养我们下一代的共产主义道德品质只会起毒害作用。
    我在深入生活的同时，经常要考虑的一个重要的、带根本性的问题，就是改造自己的世界观的问题。我们要让孩子们从小接受无产阶级世界观的影响，作者本人首先要具有无产阶级的世界观。记得有一次，正是收割早稻、抢种晚稻的农忙季节，小学里都放农忙假，好让孩子们帮助生产小队做些轻活。有个孩子没有参加劳动，他到溪滩里捉鱼去了。我们从田头回来的时候，正好看到他，我很欣赏他把几条肥壮的野鱼在水里赶来赶去，而他捉得更起劲了。可是等到生产小队长王银芳同志走来，一看这个孩子在捉鱼，他很严肃地把这个孩子叫上来，热情而又诚恳地批评了他这种不爱护集体利益、不爱生产劳动的思想。当时我在旁边，只觉得脸上发烧，虽然生产小队长没有批评我的态度，可是他批评那孩子的话，句句打中我的要害。这一回他教育了那个孩子，也教育了我。王银芳同志首先考虑到的，是这个孩子没有按照学校里的规定，离开了同学们，没有参加劳动，同时也影响了生产队里的集体利益。而我首先感到兴趣的是这个孩子捉鱼的情景，可以作为日后的写作素材，却忘了要写出作品去教育孩子，首先应教育眼前这个孩子，这是个立场观点问题，是有否真正尽到教育孩子们的责任问题。那天晚上我自己想想，更感觉到自己要写农村孩子们的生活，仅仅跑到村校里去听听课是根本不行的，还是要不折不扣地坚决遵照着毛主席的话做去，要深入到火热的实际斗争中去，要学习马克思列宁主义，要努力改造自己的思想感情。
    我住在皇路村一家孤儿家里的时候，和三个不同年龄的孩子相处，更认识到孩子们对现实生活是有正确的理解能力的，而且有鲜明的阶级立场，这对我的思想感情的变化也起了一定的影响。他们一家人，就是十六岁的哥哥王洪义，十四岁的姐姐水英，和十一岁的弟弟洪耀。他们虽然失去了父母，但在高级农业社照顾之下，他们的生活有了保障，学习农业技术也天天有了进步，比起解放前他们的爸爸给地主家里做牛马，真有天和地那样的差别。在他们的心里，有深厚的热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义的思想感情，因为他们年纪虽小，对党和毛主席的恩情却有切身的体会。王洪义做了小家长，在实际斗争中也锻炼得很老炼，同时也爱社如家，对于生产小队里的财产特别爱护。有一天傍晚，天色越来越黑了，洪耀给生产小队看羊还没有回来，水英就责怪生产队里的羊东跑西跑，不容易看，就咒骂这些羊还不如早些死掉好。当时我听到了，只轻描淡写地批评她几句，并没有解决她的思想问题。她的哥哥洪义听了这话竟跳了起来，大声地说：“你这个黑心鬼！羊是谁的，死掉了是谁的钱？是社里的。你倒好死掉啦，你为什么要咒骂社里的羊？”
    这是真正充满阶级感情的话。王洪义为了保卫集体利益，即使妹妹咒骂了社里的羊，他都不轻易放过，而我对他的妹妹所进行的批评，就没有他那么坚决、有力，而且热情，这正是值得我深思的地方。按理说，我的认识能力应该比洪义高，可是我缺乏爱社如家的思想感情，这一点在一个十六岁的孩子身上却表现得那么突出，这也证明毛主席把文艺工作者的立场问题放在第一位是千真万确的。我应该首先站在党的立场上看问题。如果我能时时刻刻意识到这点，那么我对一切问题的看法应该是站在党的立场上来讲话的，应该和王洪义这样爱社如家的小社员没有什么两样。
    王洪义的爱社如家，也表现在热爱劳动这方面。晚稻插秧的时候，有一天晚上他回来，笑眯眯地告诉我说，已经学会插秧啦，评工分的时候还评到十分。我看到他那种愉快的心情，也为他高兴。他这种自豪感还是为了集体，他觉得自己能够为社出更多的力啦，自己快要像成年人一样啦，这就是他感到愉快和幸福的理由。他这种朴实的感情，也感染了我，使我认识到我们的下一代是多么关心着集体，为集体利益多出一分力，就感到光荣和幸福。我想到这些，觉得自己还需要迎头赶上去，这是他给我的鼓舞力量。我看到有些儿童文学作品里，把这样大的农村孩子还描写成贪玩又缺乏生产斗争知识，更谈不到阶级斗争中孩子们所起的作用。他们强调“儿童本位”，追求“儿童情趣”，实际上是对孩子们的现实生活严重的歪曲。
    我们的下一代，是了不起的下一代！未来的英雄业绩，在现在都已经出现了萌芽。为孩子们服务是幸福的，是我们儿童文学工作者的光荣职责，让我们在毛泽东思想红旗照耀下，为我们的共产主义接班人多尽一分力量吧！
