Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The Salute Telegram from the Third National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao

Respected Party Central Committee, Respected Chairman Mao:

July 23rd is a day we will never forget! On that day, all the delegates attending the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers met you and other central leading comrades in Zhongnanhai.

You received us during your busy schedule and encouraged us, allowing us to personally experience the Party's close concern and ardent expectations for the cause of literature and art, which greatly inspired us. We felt unparalleled warmth and happiness in the sunshine of the Party!

Comrade Lu Dingyi's congratulatory speech on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council pointed out a clear path for our literary and art workers. That is, under the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving the socialist cause, we must implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend, and bringing forth the new from the old, and strive to use the art methods of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism to express our great era.

Under the leadership of the Party and following the Party's line on literature and art, we have made some achievements and received full evaluation and enthusiastic encouragement from the Party and the people. However, we cannot be complacent. We deeply know that the Party and the people have more expectations for us. We must consolidate our position, expand our achievements, continue to move towards our ambitious goals, climb one peak after another, win glory for the motherland, and make greater contributions to the cause of the Party and the people!

To this end, we guarantee to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao:

We will resolutely implement the Party's line on literature and art, continue to go deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, participate in production labor and practical work, constantly transform ourselves, realize the integration of intellectuals with workers and peasants, firmly establish the proletarian world outlook, and better use the weapons of literature and art to profoundly reflect our great era, reflect the great achievements of socialist revolution and socialist construction, reflect the soaring enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit of the working people, and shape heroic images of the heroic era, in order to raise the socialist and communist ideological awareness and moral character of the people of the whole country and promote the progress of history.

We will strive to improve our ideological level and artistic accomplishment, conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, study Chairman Mao's works, and constantly improve our artistic skills, work hard, and create works that touch the hearts of millions, so that the socialist literary and art garden of the motherland will bloom with colorful and eternally unfading flowers.

We will implement the mass line in literary and artistic work, actively develop mass amateur literary and art movements, promote mass creation, encourage cooperation between professional and amateur literary and art workers, strive to cultivate new forces, and actively promote the development of literature and art of various ethnic minorities. We will further strengthen the unity of socialist literary and art workers across the country, and under the leadership of the Party, contribute all of our strength to building our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and a modern science and culture!

We will resolutely stand on the front lines of the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, fully support the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, support the revolutionary struggles of the people in imperialist countries, and support the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace. We must strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. We must unite all progressive and revolutionary artists in the world who can be united, establish a broad united front against imperialism, and work together to strive for lasting world peace and the cause of human progress.

We, all the representatives attending the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, extend our highest respect to our beloved Party Central Committee and our beloved Chairman Mao!
