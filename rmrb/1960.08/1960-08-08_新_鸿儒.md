    New "Great Scholars"	Wei Xuan
    The Yangpu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanghai has successively selected outstanding workers with a certain level of education and production experience to serve as middle school political teachers and class advisors. Currently, 55 workers are teaching in more than ten middle and primary schools, and 74 workers, after more than two months of short-term training and internships, are about to take up new positions. Because worker-teachers prioritize politics ideologically, have a firm class stand, and possess the noble qualities of the working class, they can study diligently and be conscientious and responsible; in teaching, they can also relate to reality and make the teaching materials vivid, which is deeply welcomed by the students. Some teachers use their personal experiences in political classes, connecting them to their own miserable situation of being oppressed in the old society, which is very touching. Many students were moved to tears.
    It is exciting that outstanding workers are serving as teachers. Workers have ascended the school podium and are personally cultivating working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert, and versatile. How can this not make people feel elated?
    Today, the working people have not only been liberated politically and economically, but are also undergoing an unprecedented revolution in culture. "Working people becoming intellectualized and intellectuals becoming laborers" is the central theme of the cultural revolution. The fact that Shanghai has selected a group of workers to participate in teaching demonstrates that the cultural revolution, which has just begun, is already flourishing. Under the encouragement of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, the broad masses of working people have already mounted their horses and won their first battle. Our ability to select a group of workers to serve as teachers means that the working class in our country is not only the creator of culture, but also the disseminator of culture. It is naturally easier for the creator to take on the work of the disseminator. The improvement of teaching quality is to be expected.
    On the other hand, it is of epoch-making significance for the working class to cultivate its own intellectuals. Because the direction of teaching is ultimately determined by the people who teach. Books are dead, people are alive. The content of education must be expressed through people, and the teacher's thoughts have a profound impact on students. The participation of outstanding workers in school work, taking on the teaching of various courses and the ideological leadership of the school, further ensures the conscientious implementation of the Party's education policy.
    The development speed of China's education is unprecedented. We need a large number of teachers. The expansion of the teaching force naturally cannot be done according to the old rules. In addition to full-time teachers who have graduated from normal schools, we must also select some people from the working people, laboring women, and demobilized soldiers who have received spare-time education, and train them to become teachers. We are, on the one hand, transforming the old intellectuals, and on the other hand, actively cultivating new types of working-class intellectuals. Today, we are engaged in the solemn and glorious task of building socialism, using the diligent hands of all our working people to draw the "newest and most beautiful pictures," turning a "poor and blank" country into a prosperous and strong country. The participation of outstanding workers as teachers adds new blood to the teaching force in our country and can further accelerate the socialist construction of our country.

    新“鸿儒”	威宣
    中共上海市杨浦区委先后抽调了有一定文化水平和生产经验的优秀工人当中学政治教师和班主任。目前已经有五十五个工人在十多个中、小学里担任教学工作，有七十四个工人经过两个多月的短期训练和实习，即将走上新的岗位。工人教师由于思想上政治挂帅，阶级立场坚定，具有工人阶级的高贵品质，所以都能刻苦钻研，认真负责；他们在教学中又能联系实际，把教材讲得有血有肉，深受学生们的欢迎。有的教师在政治课中现身说法，联系自己在旧社会受压迫的悲惨境地，讲得很感动人。有不少学生被感动得流了泪。
    优秀工人担任教师是一件令人兴奋的事情。工人登上了学校的讲坛，亲自来培养又红又专、一专多能的工人阶级知识分子了，这怎么不使人感到兴高彩烈呢？
    今天，劳动人民不仅在政治上、经济上得到翻身，而且在文化上也正在进行空前的革命，“工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化”，这是进行文化革命的中心课题。上海抽调一批工人参加教学工作的事，正说明了刚刚开始的文化革命就枝叶并茂、花朵艳丽了。广大劳动群众，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的鼓舞下，已经跃马上阵，旗开得胜了。我们能够抽调一批工人担任教师，这就意味着我国的工人阶级不仅是文化的创造者，而且是文化的传播者。由创造者来担当传播者的工作，自然更是驾轻就熟。教学质量的提高，是意料中的事了。
    在另一方面，工人阶级亲自培养自己的知识分子，更有着划时代的意义。因为决定教学方向的，归根到底是教书的人。书是死的，人是活的。教育内容要通过人来表达，教师的思想给学生的影响是很深远的。优秀的工人参加学校工作，担任各种课程的教学工作和学校的思想领导工作，这就更进一步地保证了党的教育方针的认真贯彻执行。
    我国的教育事业的发展速度是空前的。我们需要大量的教师。教师队伍的扩大，自然也不能按老规矩办事。除了专职的、师范院校毕业的教师外，还要从受过业余教育的工农群众、劳动妇女和复员军人中选拔一些人，经过培养训练，担任教师。我们就是一方面改造旧知识分子，另一方面积极培养新型的工人阶级知识分子。今天，我们正是从事严肃的建设社会主义的光荣任务，用我们全体劳动人民的勤劳的双手来画“最新最美的画图”，使“一穷二白”的国家变成一个繁荣富强的国家。优秀工人担任教师，这就为我国教师队伍增加了新的血液，就更可以加速我国的社会主义建设事业。
