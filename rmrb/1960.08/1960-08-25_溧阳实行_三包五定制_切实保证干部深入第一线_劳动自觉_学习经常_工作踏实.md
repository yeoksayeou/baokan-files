Liyang Implements "Three Guarantees and Five Definite Assignments" to Genuinely Ensure Cadres Deepen into the Front Lines
    Labor is Conscious　Learning is Regular　Work is Solid
    (Our report) Jiangsu’s Liyang County has implemented a system of "Three Guarantees and Five Definite Assignments," ensuring that cadres at all levels truly immerse themselves in the front lines, strengthen leadership at the grassroots level, effectively improve their work style, delve into reality, persist in labor, persist in learning, and do their work well.
    The main contents of the "Three Guarantees" are: Guaranteeing workdays, achieving participation in production and leading production; Guaranteeing production tasks, requiring cadres to "go down with targets and return upon completion of tasks"; Guaranteeing the cultivation of activists, making friends with confidants, and setting an example in all matters. The contents of the "Five Definite Assignments" are: First, assign people, communes, teams, and positions.  First, four hundred and one relatively strong backbone cadres were drawn from the county and commune levels and all were assigned to communes and teams, serving as deputy secretaries and deputy directors of the communes and deputy secretaries and deputy captains of the brigades; at the same time, eight hundred and seventy-one cadres from various departments of the county and communes, led by the responsible comrades of the departments, were assigned to production teams to grasp the central tasks and lead the business. Second, designate dining in the canteen, taking the lead in responsibility, both eating with the members in the canteen and being responsible for running collective welfare undertakings centered on the canteen. Third, designate study days. Under normal circumstances, every Tuesday is the county party committee's study day, and every Monday is the commune and brigade's study day, and attention is paid to helping production team cadres learn, in order to continuously improve the cadres' political and ideological level and their ability to analyze and understand practical work. Fourth, designate experimental plots. Cadres at all four levels have their own experimental plots, and each level has high-yield areas, setting an example and guiding the overall work. Fifth, conduct regular inspections and evaluations to continuously improve the cadres' ideological style and leadership methods.
    Because cadres are assigned to communes, teams, and positions, and are definitely responsible to the end, they all feel a heavy responsibility, and actively and proactively do various tasks well, changing some people's past view of being temporary guests, making labor conscious, turning learning into a regular practice, and making work more solid. At the same time, a large number of activists have been cultivated. After the county and commune cadres went down, in just over a month, they cultivated a total of ten thousand four hundred and eighty-three activists, an average of one activist for every ten households, forming a strong force. "Everyone is working with one heart and one mind, turning barren land into gold." This has laid a solid foundation for better rural work. All of the county's one hundred and thirty-six poor teams were originally lagging behind in production due to the weak ability of their cadres. After helping and cultivating a large number of activists, their work quickly improved. For every production technical measure, county, commune, and brigade cadres personally demonstrated it in their experimental plots, explaining, doing, and promoting it simultaneously. Cadres eat in the canteen, live in the production teams, and labor and discuss matters with the members, further strengthening the relationship with the masses, promptly learning about the problems existing in the work, and quickly helping to find solutions. Therefore, the members' enthusiasm for production has been more fully mobilized, vigorously promoting the current production campaign. The county's 500,000 mu of wheat was planned to be harvested in five days, but was completed in three days. The task of transplanting 780,000 mu of rice was completed seven days ahead of schedule compared to previous years. At the recent meeting of the county party committee members and commune party secretaries, they summarized the experience of implementing the "Three Guarantees and Five Definite Assignments." On the basis of the original "Three Guarantees and Five Definite Assignments," they also absorbed the experience of the "Two-Five System" of the Wuqiao County Party Committee in Hebei Province, further improving their work style and leadership methods.

    溧阳实行“三包五定制”切实保证干部深入第一线
    劳动自觉　学习经常　工作踏实
    本报讯　江苏溧阳县实行“三包五定制”，保证了各级干部真正深入第一线，加强基层领导，切实改进作风，深入实际，坚持劳动，坚持学习做好工作。
    “三包”的主要内容是：包做劳动日，做到参加生产，领导生产；包生产任务，要求“带指标下去，完成任务回来”；包培养积极分子，交知心朋友，处处事事起带头作用。“五定”的内容是：一、以人定社定队定职。首先从县社两级抽调较强的骨干四百零一人，全部定到社、队，分别担任公社副书记、副社长和大队副书记、副大队长；同时组织县社各部门干部八百七十一名，在部门负责同志带领下，分别定到生产队，抓中心，带业务。二、定食堂吃饭，挂帅负责，既在食堂里与社员一道吃饭，又负责办好以食堂为中心的集体福利事业。三、定学习日。在一般的情况下，每周星期二为县委学习日、星期一为公社、大队学习日，并且注意帮助生产队干部学习，以不断提高干部的政治思想水平和对实际工作的分析理解水平。四、定指挥田。四级干部人人都有试验田，级级都有高产方，做出样子，指导全面。五、定期检查评比，不断改进干部思想作风和领导方法。
    由于干部实行定社、定队、定职、定责、包干到底，都感到责任重大，积极主动地做好各项工作，改变了某些人过去临时作客的观点，劳动成自觉，学习变经常，工作更踏实。同时，培养了大批积极分子。县社干部下去后，仅在短短的一个多月的时间内，共培养了积极分子一万零四百八十三名，平均每十户有一名积极分子，形成一支强有力的队伍。“上下一股劲，黄土变成金”。这就为更好地做好农村工作奠定了稳固的基础。全县一百三十六个穷队原来都因干部能力较弱，生产老是后进，通过帮助和培养了大批积极分子后，很快工作就有了起色。每一项生产技术措施，县、公社、大队干部都亲自在指挥田里做出样子，边说边做边推广。干部定在食堂吃，住在生产队里，与社员同劳动同商量，更密切了群众关系，及时了解到工作中存在的问题，迅速帮助想办法解决，因此，更充分地调动了社员的生产积极性，有力地推动了当前生产运动。全县五十万亩麦子计划五天收完，结果三天全部收割登场。七十八万亩水稻栽插任务，比往年提前七天完成。在最近召开的县委委员、公社党委书记会议上，他们总结了实行“三包五定制”的经验。他们在原有“三包五定制”的基础上，又吸取了河北省吴桥县委“二五制”的经验，进一步改进工作作风和领导方法。
