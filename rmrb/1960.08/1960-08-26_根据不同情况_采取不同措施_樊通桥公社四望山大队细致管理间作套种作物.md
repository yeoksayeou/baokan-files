Taking Different Measures According to Different Circumstances
Fantongqiao Commune's Siwangshan Brigade Meticulously Manages Intercropping and Interplanting Crops

(Our dispatch) The Siwangshan Brigade of Fantongqiao Commune in Lu'an County, Anhui Province, meticulously manages field management based on the different conditions of intercropped and interplanted crops, striving for full and thriving seedlings on every plot and high yields for every crop.

This year, the brigade conscientiously implemented the policy of "more planting for higher yields" and adopted methods such as intercropping corn and soybeans, mixed planting of sweet potatoes and sesame, and interplanting beans in cotton fields, bringing the total area of intercropped and interplanted land to over 1,000 mu. Generally, each field was planted with two or more crops, and in some cases, up to five crops were planted, achieving the goal of "multiple cropping in one field." In this situation, some commune members became complacent, saying, "This year, the fields are full of intercropped crops, and they are growing well. It doesn't matter if management is a bit lax. Like finding tofu in a pork pot, if you don't get the white, you'll get the red. Intercropping and interplanting will always yield something." After discovering this situation, the brigade's Party general branch immediately conducted education among all cadres and commune members, explaining the importance of strengthening the management of intercropped and interplanted crops: the brigade's more than 1,000 mu of intercropped and interplanted crops, of which grain crops account for more than 70%, account for 15% of the brigade's total grain output. At the same time, they analyzed the two relationships between intercropped and interplanted crops: mutual promotion and mutual hindrance. They explained that if management is not good, yields will be mutually affected; if management is strengthened, intercropped and interplanted crops can promote each other, ensuring a bumper harvest for every crop. On the basis of improving the ideological understanding of cadres and commune members, the entire brigade promoted new measures for managing intercropped and interplanted crops.

According to the different growth stages of intercropped and interplanted crops, the brigade divided management work into four steps: First, check seedlings, replant seedlings, and thin seedlings plot by plot, ridge by ridge, and row by row. It is necessary to ensure full seedlings and prevent seedling crowding, while also paying attention to the rational close planting between intercropped crop seedlings. The entire brigade organized more than 300 laborers, established more than 30 specialized teams, and adopted the method of "seeing the seedlings, filling the gaps, and thinning the dense to supplement the sparse," checking and replanting at the same time to ensure full seedlings. Then, thinning and setting seedlings are carried out to ensure that intercropped and interplanted crops reach the requirements of rational close planting. For example, corn interplanted with soybeans, while ensuring the close planting of double corn plants, no soybean seedlings are left at the roots of the corn; in the middle of the corn rows, more soybean seedlings are appropriately left to facilitate growth. Peanuts interplanted with sesame only have sesame seedlings thinned, not peanut seedlings. Second, is cultivating and weeding. Weeding is timed according to the needs of different crops. For example, in peanut fields interplanted with sesame, sesame roots are shallow, and peanut roots are deep. Therefore, weeding should be "shallow first, then deep, then shallow again" to promote sesame growth and protect peanut fruiting. Other shallow-rooted and deep-rooted intercropped crops (such as corn and soybeans) also use this method to weed. Third, is the issue of topdressing. Different fertilizers are applied separately according to the needs of the crops. Two hundred and three mu of corn land in the brigade are interplanted with soybeans. When fertilizing, corn seedlings are topdressed first. At this time, the fertilizer flows into the middle soil layer and can be absorbed by the soybeans. On the one hand, it is beneficial to the growth of soybean seedlings, and on the other hand, it is beneficial to the roots of the beans to reproduce rhizobia, increasing nutrient supply for corn growth. Soybean fertilizer is applied later, and the upper-layer fertilizer is absorbed by the corn again, which can be used mutually. Topdressing tall-stalk crops first promotes rapid growth, reduces sunlight exposure, and reduces water evaporation, which is conducive to the growth of short-stalk crops in the seedling stage. In addition, pay attention to preventing pests and diseases. Due to multiple cropping in one field, the disaster resistance capabilities of crops are inconsistent, and special attention should be paid to prevention. Each specialized team in the brigade has two or three fixed people responsible for the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, ensuring that inspections are carried out every five days and prevention and control every ten days.

In order to effectively manage intercropped and interplanted crops, a deputy secretary of the Party Committee from the brigade to the production team is fixed to be specifically responsible. At the same time, the team has also appropriately adjusted the work points for field management of intercropped and interplanted crops. Because there is a lot of labor input in this area and management requirements are meticulous, the brigade's Party general branch, based on the opinions of commune members, has adopted the method of "increasing work points without increasing production quotas" to improve the labor enthusiasm of management personnel. At present, the brigade's more than 1,000 mu of intercropped and interplanted crops have generally undergone one round of seedling checking, seedling replanting, topdressing, and weeding; the more than 500 mu planted earlier have been topdressed twice and weeded twice.

    根据不同情况  采取不同措施
    樊通桥公社四望山大队细致管理间作套种作物
    本报讯　安徽六安县樊通桥公社四望山大队根据间作、套种作物的不同情况，分别细致地进行田间管理，力争块块苗全苗旺，样样作物高产多收。
    这个队今年认真贯彻了“多种高产多收”的方针，采用了玉米、黄豆间作，山芋、芝麻混种，棉花套种豆子等办法，使间作、套种面积达一千多亩，一般的田地都种植两种以上的作物，最多的种植了五种作物，达到了“一地多作”的要求。在这种情况下，有些社员却产生了自满情绪，他们说：“今年田里茬套种的满，长得好，管理松点不要紧。猪肉锅里捞豆腐，捞不到白的捞红的。间作、套种总能收一样。”大队党总支发现这一情况后，立即在全队干部、社员中进行教育，说明了加强间作套种作物管理的重要意义：全队一千多亩间作、套种作物，其中粮食作物占70％以上，占全队粮食总产量的15％。同时，分析了间作、套种作物之间互相促进和互相妨碍的两种关系。说明如果管理不好，会相互影响产量；如果加强管理，能使间作、套种作物互相促进，保证样样作物丰收。在提高干部、社员思想认识的基础上，全大队又推行了管理间作、套种作物的新措施。
    根据间作、套种作物生长的不同阶段，这个大队将管理工作分成四个步骤：首先是逐块、逐垅逐行查苗、补苗、间苗。既要保证苗全，又要防止苗挤，同时还要注意间作作物苗与苗之间的合理密植。全队组织了三百多个劳力，成立了三十多个专业队，采取“看出苗、补缺棵、间稠补稀”的办法，边查、边补，保证全苗。接着又进行间苗和定苗，保证间作、套种作物都达到合理密植的要求。如玉米套种黄豆，在保证玉米双株密植的条件下，在玉米根部不留黄豆苗；玉米横竖行距中间，适当多留黄豆苗，以利生长。花生间种芝麻，只间芝麻苗，不间花生苗。其次，是中耕锄草。根据不同作物适时锄草。如花生地套种芝麻，芝麻根浅，花生根深，因此锄草时要达到“先浅、后深、再浅”的细锄，既促进芝麻生长，又保护花生结果。其它的浅根、深根间作作物（如玉米、黄豆间作），也采取这一办法除草。再次，是追肥问题。根据作物需要情况，分别追施不同肥料。全队二百零三亩玉米地里套种了黄豆，在施肥时，先追玉米提苗肥，这时肥料流入中土层，又可被黄豆吸收，一方面有利豆苗生长，一方面有利豆子根部繁殖根瘤菌，增加养分供给玉米生长。后追黄豆肥，上层肥料，又被玉米吸收，可以互相利用。先给高秆作物追肥，促进迅速生长，减少阳光照射，减少水分蒸发，有利矮秆作物苗期生长。此外，注意预防病虫害。由于一地多作，作物的抗灾能力不一致，特别要注意预防工作。全大队每个专业队都固定两、三人，负责病虫害的防治工作，做到五天一检查，十天一防治。
    为了切实做好间作、套种作物的管理，从大队到生产队都固定一个党委副书记具体负责，同时，队里又适当调整了间作、套种作物田间管理的工分。因为这方面用工多，管理要求细致，大队党总支根据社员意见，采取了“增加工分，不增加包产”的办法，提高管理人员的劳动积极性。目前，全大队一千多亩间作、套种作物，已普遍进行了一次查苗补苗、追肥、锄草；早种的五百多亩已追了两次肥，锄过两交草。（附图片）
