Ivory Coast

Ivory Coast, an African country that suffered more than a century of colonial rule by French imperialism, declared its independence on August 7.

Ivory Coast is located in West Africa, covering an area of 322,000 square kilometers with a population of 3.2 million. As early as the 15th century, European colonists came there to trade in ivory and slaves. Because it was a famous ivory market and bordered the Gulf of Guinea, it has long been known as the Ivory Coast. In 1842, France began to invade the country and incorporated it into French West Africa after establishing the Governor-General's Office of French West Africa in 1895.

Ivory Coast is the wealthiest country in former French West Africa. The national economy is mainly based on agriculture and forestry. Coffee production ranks first in Africa and third in the world; cocoa exports rank fourth in the world; and timber is also a major export commodity. In addition, it also produces cotton, rubber, bananas, pineapples, and livestock such as cattle and sheep. In former French West Africa, although the population of Ivory Coast accounted for only 13%, its imports accounted for 30% of the region, and exports accounted for 45%. Foreign trade generally had a surplus. However, the people of this rich country lived a very difficult life under the oppression of colonialism. The colonists plundered a large amount of land from the peasants and cruelly abused the local laborers working on the plantations.

In recent years, the tentacles of U.S. imperialism have been trying to extend to the Ivory Coast. As Adama, chairman of the Ivory Coast National Liberation Committee, said not long ago: "In the Ivory Coast, the United States is replacing France." He pointed out that in most enterprises in the Ivory Coast, American investment has accounted for 30% to 50%, especially in the oil industry, which is almost completely monopolized by American capital. According to a secret agreement between the United States and France, U.S. imperialism will also jointly use French military bases in the Ivory Coast with French colonists.

However, the people of Ivory Coast have waged a long-term struggle against colonialism to win national independence. Since the end of the 19th century, many large-scale anti-French uprisings have enabled the French colonists to maintain control only in the narrow coastal zone for a considerable period of time. After World War II, the anti-colonial struggle waged by the people of Ivory Coast and French West Africa forced the French colonists to announce the abolition of the reactionary "native law" and forced labor system, and in 1957 announced the granting of so-called "semi-autonomous republic" status to Ivory Coast and other territories. In recent years, the people of Ivory Coast, especially the workers, have persisted in their struggle despite the colonial authorities' brutal suppression, which has finally forced French imperialism to declare Ivory Coast's independence within the "French Community."

    象牙海岸
    一个曾经遭受法帝国主义一百多年殖民统治的非洲国家——象牙海岸，在8月7日宣告独立了。
    象牙海岸位于非洲西部，面积为三十二万二千平方公里，人口三百二十万。远从十五世纪起，欧洲殖民者就到那里贩卖象牙和奴隶。由于它是著名的象牙市场，并且濒临几内亚湾，因此，久远以来它就名为象牙海岸。1842年，法国开始侵入这个国家，并于1895年在成立法属西非总督府后，把它并入了法属西非。
    象牙海岸是前法属西非最富庶的国家。国民经济以农业和林业为主。咖啡的产量占非洲第一位、世界第三位；可可出口占世界第四位；木材也是主要出口商品。此外它还出产棉花、橡胶、香蕉、菠萝以及牛、羊等牲畜。在前法属西非，象牙海岸的人口虽然只占13％，然而它的进口额却占这个地区的30％，出口占45％，对外贸易一般都出超。但是这个富饶的国家的人民，在殖民主义的压榨下却过着非常困苦的生活。殖民者大量掠夺农民的土地，残酷地虐待在种植园工作的当地劳动人民。
    近年来，美帝国主义的侵略触须竭力向象牙海岸伸展。正如不久之前象牙海岸民族解放委员会主席阿当所说：“在象牙海岸，美国正在取法国而代之。”他指出，目前在象牙海岸大部分企业中，美国投资已占30％至50％，特别是石油业，几乎完全被美国资本垄断。美帝国主义并将根据美法一项秘密协定，和法国殖民者共同使用法国在象牙海岸的军事基地。
    但是，象牙海岸人民为了争取民族独立，进行了反对殖民主义的长期斗争。从十九世纪末叶起，多次规模巨大的抗法起义，使法国殖民者在相当长时期内只能保持其在沿海狭长地带的控制。二次世界大战后，象牙海岸与法属西非人民所进行的反殖民主义斗争，使法国殖民者不得不宣布废除反动的“土著法”和强迫劳动制，并在1957年宣布给予象牙海岸和其他领地以所谓“半自治共和国”的地位。由于近年来象牙海岸人民，特别是工人，不顾殖民当局的残酷镇压，坚持斗争，终于使法帝国主义被迫宣布让象牙海岸在“法兰西共同体”内独立。（庄）（附图片）
