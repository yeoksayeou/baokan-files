    *Strive to Be Advanced, Seize the Red Flag*
    After reading the People's Daily editorial "Immediately Launch a Production Increase and Thrift Campaign Centered on Grain and Steel," I enthusiastically respond to this call.
    Our two open-hearth furnaces at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant have continuously maintained the national high-yield Red Flag in the past two years. This year, the Red Flag was seized by the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant. At the beginning of August, after we went to the No. 1 Plant to learn, we found that the reason their production was better than ours was due to the high level of the masses' communist spirit. Therefore, at the beginning of this month, we vigorously launched communist collaboration, improved the relationship between various work sections, and humbly learned from the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, studying their advanced thinking and advanced operating methods. Everyone put forward the slogan "Fight the high temperature, seize high production, enhance ambition, and seize the Red Flag." The Party branch closely grasped the labor competition. In the first half of the month, the output of our open-hearth furnace increased by 27% compared with the same period last month. Every comrade in the open-hearth furnace knows that the situation in the first half of the month has improved, but there is still a big gap compared with the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant. We are determined to further develop the production increase and thrift campaign. We want to ensure that every shift and group has targets and measures to guarantee a great effort in the last four months, and dedicate all our strength to complete and overfulfill this year's steel production task.

    ＊争上游夺红旗＊
    读了人民日报“立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”的社论，我热烈响应这个号召。
    我们上钢三厂两座平炉，在过去两年，连续保持全国高产红旗。今年，红旗被上钢一厂夺去了。8月初，我们去一厂学习后，发现人家生产所以比我们好，是群众的共产主义风格高。所以这个月一开始，我们就大力开展共产主义协作，搞好各工段的关系，虚心地向上钢一厂学习，学习他们的先进思想和先进操作法。大家提出了“战高温，夺高产，长志气，夺红旗”的口号。党支部抓紧了劳动竞赛。在前半个月中，我们平炉的产量比上月同期增长了27％。平炉上每个同志都知道，上半月的情况是有进步，但比起上钢一厂来还有很大距离。我们决心进一步开展增产节约运动。我们要做到每个班、组都有指标，都有措施，保证在最后四个多月中，大干一场，为完成和超额完成今年钢产任务献出一切力量。上海第三钢厂工程师
