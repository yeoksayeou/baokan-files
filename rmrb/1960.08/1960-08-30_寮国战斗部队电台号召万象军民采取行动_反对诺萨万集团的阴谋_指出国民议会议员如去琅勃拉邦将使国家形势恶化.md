    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 28th - The Lao Fighting Forces Radio broadcast a commentary on the evening of the 28th opposing the Lao National Assembly members' trip to Luang Prabang to hold a meeting with the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group.

    The commentary pointed out that it is very clear that if the National Assembly members go to Luang Prabang, the Phoumi Nosavan reactionary group will definitely use pressure to force the National Assembly to agree to their proposals to undermine the genuine policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony. They will use the National Assembly as a tool to serve their policies of betraying the country and harming the people. The commentary said that in this way, the national situation will become very dangerous.

    The commentary said, everyone knows that Luang Prabang is a place controlled by the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group. Prince Souvanna Phouma himself has also said that the Phoumi Nosavan reactionary group once detained representatives sent by the government and the National Assembly to submit documents to the King. They also obstructed the King from exercising his rights. The people of our country know that the King has appointed Prince Souvanna Phouma to form a cabinet. After the reactionary government of Chao Samsanith-Phoumi Nosavan was overthrown, the National Assembly unanimously voted its trust in the Souvanna Phouma government, which has announced that it will implement a genuine policy of peace, neutrality, and democratic harmony. However, the Phoumi Nosavan group has betrayed the motherland, the King, and the Constitution, and opposes the resolutions of the National Assembly and the orders of the government. The commentary then called on the officers, soldiers, youths, and people of Vientiane who have fought for genuine peace and neutrality to oppose the National Assembly members' trip to Luang Prabang.

    The commentary pointed out that if the Phoumi Nosavan reactionary group wants to negotiate with the government to peacefully resolve the Laotian issue, they must come to Vientiane for negotiations. If they stubbornly refuse the government's instructions and the National Assembly's resolutions, then they are deliberately creating bloodshed and making the national situation more complicated and worse, and they must bear full responsibility for their heinous crimes.

    寮国战斗部队电台号召万象军民采取行动
    反对诺萨万集团的阴谋
    指出国民议会议员如去琅勃拉邦将使国家形势恶化
    新华社河内28日电　寮国战斗部队电台28日晚上发表评论反对老挝国民议会议员去琅勃拉邦同富米·诺萨万卖国集团举行会议。
    评论指出，很显然，如果国民议会议员去琅勃拉邦，富米·诺萨万反动集团一定会使用压力迫使国民议会答应它们破坏真正的和平中立和民族和睦政策的建议，它们将会利用国民议会当作服务于它们卖国殃民政策的工具。评论说，这样，国家形势将变得非常危险。
    评论说，大家知道，琅勃拉邦是富米·诺萨万叛国集团控制的地方。富马亲王本人也说过，富米·诺萨万反动集团曾经把政府和国民议会派去向国王呈交文件的代表拘留起来。他们还阻挠国王行使他的权利。我国人民都知道，国王已经指定梭发那·富马亲王组阁。昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万反动政府被推翻之后，国民议会已经一致投票信任梭发那·富马政府，这个政府已经宣布要实现真正的和平、中立和民主和睦的政策。但是，富米·诺萨万集团背叛了祖国、国王和宪法，反对国民议会的决议和政府的命令。评论接着号召曾经为争取真正的和平和中立而进行斗争的万象官兵们、青年们和人民反对国民议会议员去琅勃拉邦。
    评论指出，如果富米·诺萨万反动集团要同政府谈判以和平解决老挝问题，他们必须到万象来进行谈判。如果它们顽固地拒绝政府的指示和国民议会的决议，那么他们就是蓄意制造流血，使国家局势更加复杂和恶化，他们必须对他们的滔天罪行负完全责任。
