Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th -- The preparatory meeting for the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament passed the report of the second group discussion on the 4th. The report said: The group meeting unanimously agreed that the disasters suffered by the people of many countries "originated in U.S. imperialism, and these disasters cannot be eliminated unless all U.S. overseas bases are abolished."

The report said: At this group meeting, many representatives elaborated in particular on how the imperialist policies headed by the United States threaten the lives of people all over the world. The West German representative first pointed out how West Germany's current militarism oppresses the lives of its citizens. The group discussion revealed the close connection between the nuclear armament of Japan and West Germany. The "Emergency Law" and "Emergency Conscription Law" passed by West Germany show the path that Japan will take after revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The West German representative emphasized that with the rampant militarism comes the inevitable suppression of basic civil rights.

The report said, "Militaristic policies and the policy of strengthening military bases cause the people of many countries to suffer the pain of poverty. The plight of the people of Okinawa, South Korea, South Vietnam, and other places is an example of this tragedy. When speaking on this issue, the Kenyan representative called for making people all over the world more aware of the current situation in Africa."

The group meeting also pointed out: "The military alliance system headed by the United States subjects people all over the world to undue oppression."

The report pointed out: "As for the so-called economic 'aid' of imperialism, this is nothing more than economic oppression and exploitation of underdeveloped countries under the pretext of economic 'aid'. In this regard, the Indonesian representative cited some specific examples. There is no doubt that the backward state of these countries is the result of colonialism imposed on them. In this regard, it has been proven that the lives of the people of these countries will not improve substantially unless the independence of these countries is guaranteed and economic cooperation is carried out on the basis of mutually beneficial and equal principles."

The report said: The group meeting also discussed the issue of radioactivity. Representatives of Japanese scientists and doctors emphasized that mankind cannot be safe unless nuclear test explosions are prohibited.

Japanese scientists also said that the peaceful use of atomic energy is an important issue that people and scientists should pay attention to. They firmly believe that the struggle of scientists for peace must be combined with the comprehensive struggle of the general public for peace. They also firmly believe that science should be used entirely for the benefit of mankind.

The report said: The security of the world cannot be guaranteed unless nuclear weapons are prohibited.

    预备会议通过第二分组报告
    美帝国主义为各国人民带来灾祸
    帝国主义的经济“援助”是进行经济压迫和剥削的借口
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会预备会议4日通过了第二分组讨论结果报告。报告说：分组会议一致认为，许多国家人民所遭受的灾祸“都起源于美帝国主义，除非废除美国的一切海外基地，否则就不能消除这些灾难”。
    报告说：在这个分组会议上，许多代表特别阐述了以美国为首的帝国主义政策怎样使世界各国人民的生命遭受威胁。西德代表首先指出西德目前的军国主义怎样使国民生活遭受压迫。分组会议的讨论揭露了日本和西德的核武装有着密切的联系。西德通过的“紧急法”和“紧急征兵法”表明了日本在修改日美“安全条约”之后将要走的道路。西德代表强调，随着军国主义的猖獗而来的必然是公民基本权利受到压制。
    报告说，“军国主义政策和加强军事基地的政策使许多国家的人民遭受贫困的痛苦。冲绳、南朝鲜、越南南方和其它地方的人民的处境，是这种悲剧的例证。怯尼亚代表在讲到这个问题时，要求使全世界人民更多地了解非洲目前的局势。”
    分组会议并且指出：“以美国为首的军事联盟体系使世界各地人民遭受不应有的压迫。”
    报告指出：“至于帝国主义的所谓经济‘援助’，这无非是在经济‘援助’的借口下对不发达国家进行经济压迫和剥削。在这方面，印度尼西亚代表举了一些具体的事例。这些国家的落后状态是强加于它们的殖民主义所带来的结果，这一点是无可置疑的。在这方面，业经证实的是：除非这些国家的独立得到保证并实行建立在互利和平等原则的基础之上的经济合作，否则这些国家人民的生活不会有实质上的改善。”
    报告说：分组会议还谈到放射性问题。日本科学家和医生的代表们强调说，如果不禁止核试验爆炸，人类就得不到安全。
    日本科学家还说，和平利用原子能是人民和科学家都应该注意的重要问题。他们坚决认为，必须把科学家争取和平的斗争同广大公众争取和平的全面斗争结合起来。他们还坚决认为，科学应该完全用来为人类谋福利。
    报告说：除非实现了禁止核武器，否则世界的安全不可能有保证。
