Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, August 22nd: The Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, Sardar Mohammed Daoud, held a grand banquet last night to welcome Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China.

Afghan Deputy Prime Minister Ali Mohammed and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sardar Mohammed Naim attended the banquet.

In his speech at the banquet, Afghan Prime Minister Daoud said: The friendly relations that currently exist between Afghanistan and China arise from long-standing interactions within a complete friendship that has continued throughout history. He said that because of the strong qualities of mutual friendship, goodwill, and respect between the two friendly neighbors, our relations with China are now further strengthened.

Daoud said: Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Afghanistan and his own and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Naim's visits to China have further strengthened the friendship and friendly ties between the two countries. Vice Premier Chen Yi's visit to Afghanistan this time is another symbol of the goodwill and common desire to promote and consolidate this friendly relationship.

Prime Minister Daoud said: Although the social and economic lives of our two peoples are different, the good relations between Afghanistan and China continue, which is an outstanding example of mutual understanding, a strong belief in friendship between peoples and nations, and a desire for peaceful coexistence for the benefit of world peace and international cooperation.

Prime Minister Daoud said that his visit to China left pleasant memories in his mind. He said that the progress and achievements made by China in a short period are not only commendable but also make its friends happy. He said, "The determination and efforts shown by the Chinese people to build their country are highly valued by our people. Our people are busy making up for the losses and damages they suffered in their unremitting struggle to defend their independence. We hope to complete this task in an atmosphere of world peace and tranquility. Therefore, our people are striving to take advantage of this opportunity and use their energy to develop their economic and social life and improve their living standards."

He said: Afghanistan continues to pursue a policy of neutrality and non-participation in military blocs. He added that this policy is to strive for friendship and promote friendly cooperation for the benefit of world peace.

Daoud said: "In order to strengthen the Bandung spirit and its lofty ideals, especially when the world is in a state of turmoil and there is a greater need for mutual understanding and the elimination of differences, Asian and African countries must strengthen cooperation." Daoud said, "The current world is suffering from a series of international difficulties, which cause greater unease and dissatisfaction. This state of tension, which threatens human survival, makes us more convinced than ever of the value and effect of mutual understanding and respect for world stability and true peace. We hope that those who bear responsibility in the world will recognize this fact and make efforts to achieve these goals."

Finally, Daoud said that Vice Premier Chen Yi's participation in Afghanistan's major national holiday, Independence Day celebrations, is of particular significance. He expressed hope that Vice Premier Chen Yi's visit will help further strengthen the friendship and understanding between the peoples of Afghanistan and China.

Next, Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, on the eve of the 42nd anniversary of Afghanistan's independence, he first expressed his sincere respect and warm congratulations to the heroic Afghan people.

In his speech, Chen Yi reviewed the historical ties between the peoples of China and Afghanistan and the growing friendship between the two countries. He said that for thousands of years, China and Afghanistan have lived in harmony. In the years of heroic struggle against colonialist aggressor forces, the people of the two countries have always cared for and sympathized with each other. He then said: "After the founding of the People's Republic of China, our friendship, which has stood the test of history, has been newly developing on a new basis." Chen Yi pointed out that Afghanistan was one of the first countries that recognized the People's Republic of China; the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan has always advocated the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations; the Afghan people have always sympathized with the Chinese people in their struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Vice Premier said that the Chinese government and people deeply appreciate this.

Chen Yi said: "The Chinese government and people have always given high praise and active support to the peaceful and neutral foreign policy pursued by the government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, and to your efforts to promote friendship among peoples and strive for world peace." He said that the Chinese government and people will always unswervingly work to consolidate and develop the friendly relations between China and Afghanistan.

Chen Yi then said: "The Chinese government has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy, advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and has been making sincere efforts for this unremittingly." He pointed out that the well-known Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were first advocated by the Chinese government together with the Indian government and the Burmese government. He said that the increasingly developed friendly relations between our two countries are a concrete embodiment of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said: China has signed a treaty of friendship and non-aggression and an agreement on the Sino-Burmese border issue with Burma, and a treaty of peace and friendship and an agreement on the Sino-Nepalese border issue with Nepal, which are good examples of implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Chen Yi emphasized: "China not only sincerely hopes to live in harmony with all its neighbors, but also sincerely hopes that peace in Asia and the world can be guaranteed. To this end, the Chinese government has consistently supported the Soviet Union's initiatives and actions on disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and other measures aimed at easing international tensions. The Chinese government has repeatedly suggested that countries in Asia and the Pacific region, including the United States, conclude a peace pact of mutual non-aggression and make this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone."

Chen Yi said: "The peaceful foreign policy pursued by the Chinese government is by no means a expedient measure, but has profound historical and social roots. Our country's socialist system determines the peaceful nature of our foreign policy. The Chinese people have always been a peace-loving people. The Chinese people have gone through a long and arduous struggle to achieve their own liberation, and are now building their own country, determined to change the face of 'poverty and blankness', and urgently need a peaceful international environment." He said: "China's peaceful foreign policy is sincere, unwavering, and can stand the test of time." Chen Yi then said: "The People's Republic of China has never, and will never, invade and harm others. On the contrary, China is still suffering from the invasion and harm of others. In the struggle against aggression and for peace, the Chinese people need the sympathy and support of the people of all countries, and the Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the struggle of the people of all countries against aggression and for peace. The Chinese people are determined to unite with the Afghan people and the people of all countries in the world to continue to struggle for the attainment and maintenance of world peace."

In his speech, Chen Yi finally expressed his firm belief that in the years to come, the deep friendship and friendly cooperative relations between China and Afghanistan, under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, will be continuously consolidated and developed, thereby making a greater contribution to promoting the unity of Asian and African countries and maintaining world peace.

This banquet, filled with friendly sentiments, was held at the "Kabul Hotel". Other Chinese guests attending the banquet included Kong Yuan, Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council, Geng Biao, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and other members of Vice Premier Chen Yi's entourage, as well as Hao Ting, the Chinese Ambassador to Afghanistan.

Also attending the banquet were Afghan cabinet ministers and senior officials, as well as foreign diplomats.

    达乌德首相盛宴欢迎陈毅副总理
    达乌德首相说：为了贯彻万隆精神亚非国家必须加强合作陈毅副总理说：中阿友好关系是和平共处五项原则的体现
    新华社喀布尔22日电　阿富汗王国首相萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德昨天晚间为中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅举行盛大宴会。
    阿富汗副首相阿里·穆罕默德和副首相兼外交大臣萨达尔·穆罕默德·纳伊姆出席了宴会。
    阿富汗首相达乌德在宴会上致辞说：目前存在于阿富汗和中国之间的友好关系出自在整个历史上连绵不断的完满友谊中长期存在的交往。他说，由于两个友好邻国之间存在着相互友谊、善意和尊重的坚强的素质，现在我们同中国的关系进一步加强了。
    达乌德说：周恩来总理对阿富汗的访问和他自己以及副首相兼外交大臣纳伊姆对中国的访问，进一步加强了两国之间的友谊和友好联系。陈毅副总理这次前来访问阿富汗，是促进和巩固这种友好关系的善意和共同愿望的另一个象征。
    达乌德首相说：尽管我们两国人民的社会和经济生活有所不同，阿富汗和中国之间的良好关系仍然在继续下去，这是互相谅解、对人民和民族之间的友谊的坚强信念以及为了世界和平和国际合作的利益而和平相处的愿望的杰出的榜样。
    达乌德首相说，他对中国的访问在他心里留下了愉快的回忆。他说，中国在短短的时期内取得的进步和成就不仅是值得赞扬的，而且使得它的朋友们感到喜悦。他说，“中国人民为了建设自己的国家所表现的决心和作出的努力，受到我国人民的极大的重视。我国人民正忙于弥补他们为了保卫自己的独立进行不懈斗争而遭受的损失和破坏。我们希望在世界和平和安宁的气氛中来完成这个任务。所以，我国人民正在力求利用这个机会并把自己的精力用在发展自己的经济和社会生活以及改善自己的生活水平方面”。
    他说：阿富汗继续奉行着中立和不参加军事集团的政策。他又说，这个政策是为了争取友谊并为了世界和平的利益，促进友好合作。
    达乌德说：“为了加强万隆精神和它的崇高理想，特别是在世界处于动荡状态而更加需要互相谅解和消除分歧的时候，亚非国家之间必须加强合作。”达乌德说，“目前的世界遭受着一系列的国际上的困难，这种困难引起更大的不安和不满。威胁着人类生存的这种紧张状态，比以往任何时候更加使我们坚信，为了世界的稳定和真正的和平而互相谅解和尊重的价值和效果。我们希望在世界上承担着责任的人们认识到这个事实，并为达到这些目的而作出努力。”
    达乌德最后说，陈毅副总理参加阿富汗全国重大节日独立节庆典，是有特别重大意义的。他表示希望，陈毅副总理的访问将有助于进一步加强阿富汗和中国两国人民之间的友谊和谅解。
    接着，陈毅副总理讲话。他代表中国政府和人民，在阿富汗独立四十二周年的伟大节日的前夕，首先向英雄的阿富汗人民表示诚挚的敬意和热烈的祝贺。
    陈毅在他的讲话中回顾了中国和阿富汗两国人民之间的历史联系和两国之间的日益增长的友谊。他说，几千年来，中国和阿富汗一直和睦相处。在对殖民主义侵略势力进行英勇斗争的年月里，两国人民也一直是互相关怀、互相同情的。他接着说：“在中华人民共和国成立以后，我们两国经过历史考验的友谊，又在新的基础上得到了新的发展。”陈毅指出，阿富汗是最早承认中华人民共和国的国家之一；阿富汗王国政府一贯主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位；阿富汗人民一直同情中国人民为维护国家主权和领土完整所进行的斗争。副总理说，这是中国政府和人民深为感谢的。
    陈毅说：“中国政府和人民对阿富汗王国政府所奉行的和平中立的外交政策，对于你们为促进各国人民友好、争取世界和平所作的努力，一直给予很高的评价和积极的支持。”他说，中国政府和人民将始终不渝地为巩固和发展中国和阿富汗两国之间的友好关系而努力。
    陈毅接着说：“中国政府一贯奉行和平外交政策，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，并且坚持不懈地为此进行着真诚的努力。”他指出，著名的和平共处五项原则，就是中国政府同印度政府和缅甸政府首先倡导的。他说，我们两国之间日益发展的友好关系，就是和平共处五项原则的具体体现。他说：中国同缅甸签订了友好互不侵犯条约和关于中缅边界问题的协定，同尼泊尔签订了和平友好条约和关于中尼边界问题的协定，这就是执行和平共处五项原则的良好范例。
    陈毅强调说：“中国不仅诚心诚意地希望同自己所有的邻邦和睦相处，而且诚心诚意地希望亚洲和世界的和平也能得到保证。为此，中国政府一贯支持苏联关于裁军、禁止核武器以及其他旨在缓和国际紧张局势的倡议和行动。中国政府一再建议亚洲和太平洋地区各国，包括美国在内，缔结一个互不侵犯的和平公约，并且使这个地区成为无核子武器区。”
    陈毅说：“中国政府所奉行的和平外交政策，决不是一种权宜之计，而是有着深刻的历史和社会根源的。我国的社会主义制度决定了我国外交政策的和平性质。中国人民从来就是爱好和平的人民。中国人民经过长期艰苦的斗争，才取得自己的解放，现在正在建设着自己的国家，立志改变‘一穷二白’的面貌，非常需要一个和平的国际环境。”他说：“中国的和平外交政策是真诚的，坚定不移的，是经得起时间的考验的。”陈毅接着说：“中华人民共和国从来没有，而且永远不会侵略和损害别人，相反，中国直到现在还遭受着别人的侵略和损害。在反对侵略和争取和平的斗争中，中国人民需要各国人民的同情和支持，中国人民也一贯同情和支持各国人民反对侵略和争取和平的斗争。中国人民决心同阿富汗人民和世界各国人民团结一致，继续为争取和维护世界和平而奋斗。”
    陈毅在他的讲话中最后表示深信，在今后的年代里，中国和阿富汗两国之间的深厚友谊和友好合作关系，在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的指导下，必将不断地巩固和发展，从而对促进亚非各国的团结和维护世界的和平作出更大的贡献。
    充满友好感情的这个宴会是在“喀布尔饭店”举行的。出席宴会的其他中国客人有国务院外事办公室副主任孔原、外交部副部长耿飚和陈毅副总理的其他随行人员以及中国驻阿富汗大使郝汀。
    出席宴会的还有阿富汗的内阁大臣们和高级官员以及各国外交使节。
