Building Large-Scale Ten-Thousand Mu Ten-Thousand Shi Buckwheat High-Yield Fields
Yan'an County Masses Exert All Their Efforts to Strive for a Bumper Late Autumn Harvest

(Our Dispatch) The masses of Yan'an County, Shaanxi Province, are launching a movement to build a thousand blocks of ten-thousand mu ten-thousand shi buckwheat high-yield fields in the late autumn sowing season, aiming to remove the label of low yield from buckwheat and strive for a comprehensive and greater bumper harvest in the autumn fields. By July 21st, the county had already built 25,000 mu of buckwheat high-yield fields across thousands of hills and slopes, accounting for 50% of the total buckwheat land area.

This county has a tradition of planting buckwheat, but the average yield per mu is only seventy or eighty jin. Some people believe that "buckwheat is inherently a low-yield crop." Therefore, in the past, when working on autumn field high yields, more attention was paid to corn and millet, and little effort was put into buckwheat. Recently, encouraged by the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee's sixteen articles on striving for a greater bumper harvest in the autumn fields, the County Party Committee, in order to comprehensively seize high yields in the autumn fields, decided to focus on buckwheat high yields as it does on other crops, and proposed to the entire county: Immediately take action and launch a movement of a thousand blocks of ten-thousand mu ten-thousand shi (three hundred jin) buckwheat high-yield fields.

At the beginning of the yield increase movement, many people still held old discriminatory attitudes towards buckwheat, saying "buckwheat has little potential." Party organizations at all levels mobilized commune members to present reasons, calculate detailed accounts, and investigate the causes of low yields, and launched debates on the above arguments. On July 14th, the Yaodianzi Commune convened a meeting of team branch secretaries and team leaders to debate the idea that "buckwheat simply cannot yield one shi". At the meeting, experienced veteran farmers said that as long as buckwheat is rationally and densely planted, more than 4,000 nests can be planted per mu, and if each nest is properly managed, it can yield at least one and a half liang. Everyone calculated the detailed accounts and found that each mu could yield 375 jin, far exceeding one shi. However, some people then said: "The calculation works, but the buckwheat skin is thin (meaning it cannot withstand any natural disasters), and it is not guaranteed." Experienced veteran farmers said that this is the lazy thinking of relying on heaven for food, and listed many methods for preventing and controlling buckwheat pests and frost, explaining that buckwheat is not inherently a low-yield crop. This greatly liberated people's thinking.

Following this, a wave of enthusiasm for large-scale buckwheat high-yield fields quickly rose in the entire county, from commune to commune and team to team. Each commune organized buckwheat high-yield field cultivation guidance and inspection teams to specifically lead and take charge of different areas. Each team also universally established specialized groups to implement "four fixings" (fixed plot, fixed task, fixed measures, fixed yield), with specialized responsibility for cultivation. Fengzhuang Commune also established a file system and created a quick report on buckwheat high-yield experience exchange. Zhao'an Commune established twelve "secretary high-yield fields" and experimental fields, which were personally cultivated by the leaders of the commune and management area to gain experience, promote it in a timely manner, and guide large-scale buckwheat to achieve comprehensive high yields.

In cultivating buckwheat high-yield fields, various localities, based on the characteristics of buckwheat's short growing time and need for high wind and sufficient soil moisture, first selected the land. Generally, high-yield fields were built on windward and shady mountain slopes or mountain ridges with less severe soil erosion, and the land was processed and cultivated carefully, with fine harrowing to ensure complete emergence. The high-yield fields of many communes were plowed once more than ordinary fields, applying more than 3,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and the seeds were universally carefully selected and tested for germination.

Currently, all parts of the county are seizing the opportunity to sow in a timely manner while preserving soil moisture.

### 大建万亩万石荞麦丰产田  延安县群众鼓足干劲力争晚秋多收粮

    大建万亩万石荞麦丰产田
    延安县群众鼓足干劲力争晚秋多收粮
    本报讯　陕西延安县在晚秋播种中，掀起了一个大建千块万亩万石荞麦丰产田运动，要给荞麦摘掉低产帽子，力争秋田全面更大丰收。到7月21日，全县已在千山万坡建起荞麦丰产田两万五千亩，占到荞麦地总面积的50％。
    这个县素有种荞麦习惯，但平均亩产不过七、八十斤。有人认为“荞麦是天生的低产作物”。因此，以往搞秋田丰产，多抓玉米、糜谷，不敢搞荞麦。最近，在陕西省委、省人委力争秋田更大丰收十六条的号召鼓舞下，县委为了全面夺取秋田高产，决心像抓其它作物一样大抓荞麦丰产，向全县提出：立即动手，开展千块万亩万石（三百斤）荞麦丰产运动。
    增产运动一开始，不少人对于荞麦仍抱着旧的歧视态度，说“荞麦潜力不大”。各级党组织发动社员摆理由，算细账，查低产原因，对上述论调展开辩论，7月14日，姚店子公社召集队支书记、队长会议，针对有些人说“荞麦根本打不过石”的思想展开辩论。会上，有经验的老农说，荞麦只要合理密植，每亩可种四千多窝，务育好一窝至少可打一两半。大家就算细账，算出每亩能打三百七十五斤，大大超过一石。但是有人又说：“算是能行，就是荞麦皮儿薄（意思是经不起一点自然灾害），不保险。”有经验的老农又说，这是靠天吃饭的懒汉思想，并列出好多防治荞麦虫害、霜冻的办法，说明荞麦并非天生的低产作物。这就大大解放了人们的思想。
    跟着一个社社、队队大搞荞麦丰产田的热潮在全县迅速兴起。各社都组织了荞麦丰产田务育指导检查团，具体分片包干领导。各队又普遍建立专业组，实行“四固定”（定地块、定任务、定措施、定产量）、专责务育。冯庄公社还建立了档案制，创办了荞麦丰产经验交流快报。招安公社建立了“书记丰产田”和试验田十二块，由社和管区的领导干部亲自务育，摸出经验，及时推广，指导大方荞麦全面高产。
    在培育荞麦丰产田中，各地根据荞麦生长时间短、需要风头高、墒气足等特点，首先选择了土地，一般都把丰产方建在吃风背阴山坡或水土流失不严重的山梁地，并对土地进行了加工培养，细耙细耱，以保证出苗齐全。好多公社的丰产田还较一般田多耕了一次，每亩施底肥三千多斤，并对种子普遍作了精选和发芽试验。
    现在，全县各地正在抢墒抢时播种。
