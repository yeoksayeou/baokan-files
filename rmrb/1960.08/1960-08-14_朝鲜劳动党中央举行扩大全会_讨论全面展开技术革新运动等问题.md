The communique said: The Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea held an enlarged plenary session from August 8th to 11th, discussing the following issues: 1. On comprehensively launching the technical innovation movement in all sectors of the national economy; 2. On improving and strengthening the work of cultivating technical talent; 3. On the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries held in Bucharest.

The communique said: Comrade Kim Il, First Vice Premier of the Cabinet, made a report on the first agenda item, and Comrade Kim Chang-man, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Party, made a report on the second agenda item. Many comrades spoke at the meeting. Comrade Kim Il-sung made an important speech on the fourth day of the meeting.

The communique said: The plenary session adopted corresponding resolutions separately.

Regarding the comprehensive launching of the technical innovation movement in all sectors of the national economy, the communique said that the plenary session summarized the great achievements made in the development of the national economy and the technical revolution under the leadership of the Party in recent years. "The plenary session resolution pointed out: In order to effectively utilize all our conditions and possibilities and capture the fortress of the technical revolution in the shortest possible time, it is necessary to carry out a technical innovation movement of the whole party and the whole people to realize the mechanization of all sectors that still use handicraft technology and to automate the sectors that use modern machinery."

The communique said, "The plenary session pointed out that the mechanization of agriculture occupies the most important position in the technical revolution in our country today; and especially emphasized that promoting the mechanization of agriculture at present has special significance for the rapid development of animal husbandry. At the same time, the plenary session put forward a clear guideline of combining large and medium-sized machines, and combining modern mechanization with animal-powered mechanization, so as to comprehensively realize mechanization in all rural areas, including mountainous and remote areas, in the next few years."

The communique said that the plenary session emphasized that Party organizations at all levels should deeply publicize and implement the political and economic significance of technical innovation among Party members and the masses, thoroughly overcome conservatism, negativity, technical mysticism and departmentalism, and fill everyone with the revolutionary spirit of unconditionally accepting and implementing the Party's policies. At the same time, all working people and every organ should work together with one heart and one mind, give full play to mass creativity, and organize a movement of the whole party and the whole people. The communique said that when discussing the work of improving and strengthening the cultivation of technical talent, the plenary session pointed out that as a result of implementing the correct policy of the Workers' Party on cultivating technical talent, the number of engineers and experts in 1959 increased by 4.3 times compared with 1953. Now, there are more than 32,200 engineers and experts and more than 66,900 technicians and secondary experts working in the national economy and other sectors. The communique said, "The plenary session pointed out that although such achievements have been made, under the conditions of the leap forward development of the national economy, especially the continuous expansion of new sectors in industry, and the great increase in the demand for technical talent in various sectors, a certain imbalance has been created between the number of technical personnel trained today and the social demand for technical talent. In view of this, the plenary session discussed and decided to rapidly overcome the existing shortcomings in the cultivation of technical talent, so that the work of cultivating technical personnel can keep up with the rapidly advancing socialist construction of the country."

The communique said, "The plenary session emphasized that fully meeting the rapidly growing needs of all sectors of the national economy for technical personnel is one of the urgent tasks facing our Party." The communique said that the plenary session called for measures such as organizing various technical schools in factories, enterprises, construction sites, hospitals, and state-owned farms and ranches, increasing the number of students in existing universities, and educating working youth in the form of correspondence courses, so as to cultivate more than seven times as many engineers and experts by 1970 as in 1960.

The communique said, "The plenary session reiterated the correctness of our Party's policy of combining education with productive labor," "The plenary session emphasized the great significance of strengthening the work of cultivating technical talent in further raising the technical and cultural level of the working people."
