Editor's Note: Several outstanding examples of communes, management areas, and production teams practicing diligence and thrift in running their affairs are selected here. We can see from these examples that the success of diligence and thrift largely depends on leading cadres setting an example. Wang Jinsheng, the first secretary of the Wangdagua Commune Party Committee, emphasizes diligence and thrift in everything from production to daily life, from agricultural infrastructure construction to daily office supplies. Under his leadership, the commune has also equipped each level with capable financial managers. With such a group of "good housekeepers," diligence and thrift become a social custom throughout the commune.

Fei Hai Commune Greatly Reduces Non-Productive Expenditures

The leading cadres of the Fei Hai Commune in Huangyuan County, Qinghai Province, take the lead in being diligent and thrifty in all aspects and vigorously practice economy, constantly reducing various expenditures. In the months after the establishment of the commune in 1958, the proportion of non-productive expenditures was very small. In 1959, non-productive expenditures were reduced to only 2.2% of the total income of the commune. In the first seven months of this year, this proportion further decreased to 1.1%.

In the autumn of 1958, agricultural production achieved a bumper harvest. Some people advocated building new offices, auditoriums, and guest houses, and purchasing office equipment. The commune Party Committee resolutely disagreed. The commune only bought one bicycle for public use, for urgent matters. The commune's office is still an old courtyard taken over just after liberation ten years ago, only refurbished, and the partition walls of three rooms were removed to convert them into a conference room.

Because cadres set an example, members of all production teams have learned to be diligent and thrifty. The Xia Hu Dan Du Production Team of this commune has always been a poor team. Before 1958, the state had to supply them with 100,000 to 200,000 jin of grain every year. After the establishment of the commune, the commune often had a secretary or director to take charge of this production team, educating members to strive for strength and practice diligence and thrift. After a year of hard work, all one hundred plus households in the team vigorously engaged in agriculture, practicing economy in everything. Last year, after deducting the four major expenses of seeds, rations, feed, and grain requisition, there was a surplus of more than 10,000 jin of grain, reaching the level of a wealthy team.

In addition to strictly controlling non-productive expenditures, the Fei Hai Commune Party Committee also achieved spending less money to do more work and doing things without spending money in productive expenditures. This commune is located in a mountainous area, mostly with narrow paths, making it very inconvenient to transport seeds, farm tools, materials, and grain. At first, some cadres planned to organize a professional team and invest more than 10,000 yuan to build roads. After fully mobilizing the members to discuss it, the commune Party Committee, based on the principle of not affecting agricultural production, drew a small number of people to form a professional team to build roads year-round, mainly using the gaps before weeding, spring plowing, and autumn harvest, and rushing to repair roads during cloudy and rainy days. From the end of 1958 to last year, the entire commune built a total of fifty-two simple roads and winding mountain roads, with a total length of eighty-seven kilometers, which not only achieved spending less money to do more work, allowing the main labor force to be invested in the fields, but also formed a rural road network throughout the commune's nine brigades where horse-drawn carts could pass smoothly. This commune has many field mice, and purchasing zinc sulfide and other pesticides to eliminate them would require a large investment. Based on the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily, the leading cadres of the commune Party Committee conducted in-depth visits to old farmers and promoted the use of local wild poisonous weeds to make medicated bait, the use of wild thorns to make bows and arrows, and the use of water to irrigate rat holes to eliminate field mice. In the past two years, they have eliminated more than 110,000 field mice without spending a penny, basically freeing all cultivated land from rat damage. Thanks to careful calculation, the Fei Hai Commune has accumulated more than 239,000 yuan in funds in the two years since its establishment. Currently, the commune still has more than 130,000 yuan in savings.

### 沸海公社非生产性开支大大降低

    编者按　这里选登几个公社、管理区和生产队在勤俭办社中作得比较突出的事例。我们从这几个事例中可以看出，勤俭工作搞得好，在很大程度上决定领导干部以身作则。王大挂公社党委第一书记王金生，从生产到生活、从农业基本建设到日常办公用品，处处讲求勤俭；在他的领导下，公社还层层配备了几把理财好手，有了这样一批“好当家人”，就使勤俭成为整个公社的社会风尚。
    沸海公社非生产性开支大大降低
    青海省湟源县沸海公社领导干部带头处处勤俭、厉行节约，不断降低各种开支。1958年建社后的几个月中，非生产性开支占的比重就很小。1959年非生产性开支降低到只占全社总收入的2.2％。今年前七个月，这个比例又下降到1.1％。
    1958年秋季农业生产获得大丰收，有人主张新修一些办公室、礼堂、招待所，购置办公用具。公社党委坚决不同意。公社只买了一辆公用脚踏车，供紧急事务之用。公社的办公室还是十年前刚解放时接管的一座旧院落，只是刷新了一下，把三间房子的隔墙拆掉改成会议室。
    由于干部以身作则，各生产队的社员都学会了勤俭节约。这个公社的下胡旦度生产队一直是个穷队，1958年以前国家每年要供应他们一二十万斤粮食。成立公社后，公社经常有一名书记或主任抓这个生产队，教育社员发奋图强、克勤克俭。经过一年的苦战，全队一百多户社员大抓农业，处处节约，去年打下的粮食除去种子、口粮、饲料、征纳粮四大开支外，还有余粮一万多斤，达到了富队的水平。
    沸海公社党委除了严格控制非生产性开支外，在生产性开支上也做到了少花钱多办事，不花钱也办事。这个公社地处山区，多是羊肠小道，运种子、农具、材料、粮食等等很不方便。开头有些干部打算组织专业队、投资一万余元修道路。公社党委充分发动社员讨论后，除根据不影响农业生产的原则，抽一小部分人组成专业队常年修筑外，主要是利用除草、春耕、秋收前的空隙和阴雨天突击抢修。从1958年底起，到去年，全公社共修筑了简易公路、盘山大道五十二条，全长八十七公里，既做到了少花钱多办事，使主要劳力投入田间，又使全公社九个大队形成马车畅通的乡村道路网。这个公社田鼠多，要购置硫化锌等农药来扑灭，就需要很大一笔投资。公社党委领导干部根据勤俭办社的原则，深入访问老农，推广了用当地野生毒草制药饵、用野刺装制弓箭和用水灌鼠洞等办法扑灭田鼠。两年来，他们没花一文钱，扑灭田鼠十一万多只，使所有耕地基本上免除了鼠害。由于精打细算，沸海公社成立两年来已积累资金二十三万九千多元，目前，社里还余存款十三万多元。
