    Where Did the DDT Powder Come From?  Wu Chang
    "Who sprinkled DDT powder in our dormitory and cleaned the room so neatly?"
    Steelworkers returned from their shift to find the windows of their dormitory sparkling, the floors scrubbed clean, and their clothes and bedding neatly folded. The room was almost unrecognizable. Who had done this? They asked each other.
    With the arrival of summer, how were the workers resting after eight hours of high-temperature work? The leaders of the Second Electric Furnace Workshop of the Shanghai No. 5 Steel Plant were particularly concerned. They visited the single workers' dormitory and saw that the workers were just sleeping after work. Some rooms were not cleaned, clothes were scattered haphazardly, and there were traces of bedbugs on the beds.
    The cadres felt uneasy at the thought of the workers, who had worked hard all day, not being able to sleep peacefully. Dai Zhenhua, the Party branch secretary, thought: These single workers have no one to take care of them, and our office cadres must help them with "housekeeping." When Lao Dai told everyone his idea, everyone agreed.
    No sooner said than done. Dai Zhenhua immediately led a dozen or so cadres, carrying insecticidal powder and other items, to the single workers' dormitory for a thorough cleaning. They were afraid of waking the workers on the night shift, so they quietly swept the dust and sprinkled the powder.
    Suddenly, Zhang Hulin, a worker from the material yard sleeping on the upper bunk, woke up. Seeing the office cadres cleaning the dormitory for them, he quickly jumped out of bed, snatched the broom from Huang Boxing, the secretary of the general branch office, and said repeatedly, "You are already working hard enough, let us clean it ourselves!" Huang Boxing quickly told him softly, "Go back to bed and get some rest, you have to work the night shift tonight!" As he spoke, he gently pushed Zhang Hulin back to bed.
    They cleaned every room and carefully sprinkled DDT powder on every bed. After cleaning the rooms, they braved the scorching sun to remove weeds around the dormitory to prevent mosquitoes from hiding.
    Now, the cadres of the Second Electric Furnace Workshop regularly take turns helping single workers clean their dormitories. With the rooms clean, the workers sleep soundly after work and are even more motivated to fight the high temperatures and strive for high production. Zhao Miaolin and Zhang Hulin, workers from the material yard, co-wrote a poem expressing their determination:
    The Party's concern is better than parents, the dormitory is cleaned and looks new,
    Bedbugs and mosquitoes are wiped out, sleeping soundly until dawn.
    Sleep well, add energy,
    We will definitely make steel production rise day by day!

    哪里来的滴滴涕粉	吴昌
    “是谁给我们宿舍洒上了滴滴涕粉，把房间打扫得这样整洁？”
    钢铁工人下了班回来，看到自己宿舍玻璃窗擦得亮亮的，地板洗得干干净净，衣服、被子也叠得整整齐齐，房间变得简直快认不出来了。是谁来干的呢？他们相互询问着。
    炎夏来临，工人同志在八小时高温作业以后，休息得怎样？上钢五厂第二电炉车间领导人员特别关心。他们到单身工人宿舍，看到工人下班以后就睡觉了，有的房间没有打扫，衣物放得很零乱，床上还有臭虫的痕迹。
    一想到辛苦了一天的工人睡不安稳，干部们心里就不安。党支部书记戴振华心里想：这些单身工人没人照料，我们科室干部得帮助他们“料理家务”。老戴把他的想法和大家一说，大家都赞成。
    说干就干。戴振华立即领着十几个干部，拿着除虫药粉等物品，到单身工人宿舍大扫除。他们怕惊醒上夜班的工人，轻手轻脚地扫灰尘，洒药粉。
    忽然，睡在上铺的料场工人张虎林醒了。他看到科室干部在为他们打扫宿舍，迅速从床上跳下来，夺总支办公室秘书黄伯兴手中的扫帚，并且连声说：“你们工作已经够辛苦了，让我们自己来打扫吧！”黄伯兴赶快轻声地告诉他：“你快上床好好睡吧，晚上还得上夜班哪！”说着，就把张虎林轻轻推到床上去。
    他们把每个房间打扫干净了，又仔仔细细把每张床上都洒上了滴滴涕粉。室内打扫完了，他们又冒着烈日拔除宿舍四周的杂草，不让蚊子有藏身之处。
    现在，第二电炉车间的干部经常轮流帮助单身工人打扫宿舍。房间打扫干净了，工人干完活回来，睡得又香又甜，战高温、夺高产的劲头更大。料场工人赵妙林、张虎林合写了一首诗，表示了自己的决心：
    党的关怀胜双亲，宿舍打扫面貌新，
    臭虫蚊子灭干净，一觉睡到大天明。
    睡得好，添干劲，
    定叫钢的产量日日升！
