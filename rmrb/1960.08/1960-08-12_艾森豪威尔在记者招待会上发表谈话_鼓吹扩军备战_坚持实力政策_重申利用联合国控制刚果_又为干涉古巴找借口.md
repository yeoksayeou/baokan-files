Xinhua News Agency, 11th, Washington dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower said at a press conference on the 10th that a series of measures for arms expansion and war preparations proposed in his special message to Congress on the 8th were so-called "effective and reasonable steps" taken in response to the currently "changed" international situation. He clamored that the current atmosphere is already "very different" from the past, and the United States is taking these measures to ensure that it and its allies "maintain confidence."

Eisenhower refuted criticisms in the United States that he had proposed inadequate war preparations, stating that he would use the $621.1 million in military spending additionally allocated by the U.S. Congress to intensify arms expansion and war preparations. He said, "I don't know any reason why anyone should say that I have decided not to use this money."

In answering questions from reporters, Eisenhower also reiterated that the United States is prepared to resume underground nuclear weapons testing. He said that the United States "will no longer be bound by any gentleman's agreement on this issue." He stated that the United States would continue to obstruct the reaching of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear testing, so that "when the point of no progress has been reached, we (the United States) must take care of ourselves."

At the beginning of the press conference, Eisenhower issued a brief statement on the situation in the Congo, indicating that the United States would continue to use the United Nations to implement its plot to control the entire Congo. He demanded that "all relevant parties cooperate faithfully with the United Nations."

In answering questions about Cuba, Eisenhower once again made excuses for U.S. intervention in Cuba. He said that if a so-called "government ruled and controlled by international communism" appears in the Western Hemisphere, the United States would take "very definite action" against it. He also clamored that the United States would "finally determine a way to defeat it" after "analyzing" the situation.

When talking about the U.S. economic situation, Eisenhower self-deceptively insisted that "there is no reason to believe" that the United States has experienced "any signs that people can call a recession or depression." However, he had to admit that the operating rate of the U.S. steel industry has fallen from its peak at the beginning of the year to the current 50%, and that "everyone is paying attention." He said that this kind of "ups and downs in steel production" is "always very annoying." Eisenhower also said that the U.S. auto industry's production in July was also "not very good." He admitted that "no economic boom can be seen" in the United States at present.

    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上发表谈话
    鼓吹扩军备战　坚持实力政策
    重申利用联合国控制刚果　又为干涉古巴找借口
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔10日在记者招待会上说，他在8日致国会的特别咨文中提出的一系列扩军备战的措施，是根据目前“改变了的”国际形势而采取的所谓“有效而合理的步骤”。他叫嚣目前气氛已经和过去“很不相同”，美国采取这些措施是为了使自己和盟国“保持信心”。
    艾森豪威尔驳斥在美国有人对他提出的备战不力的批评，他表示他将运用美国国会增拨的六亿二千一百万美元的军费来加紧扩军备战。他说：“我不知道任何人有什么理由说我已决定不动用这笔钱”。
    艾森豪威尔在回答记者问题时还重申美国准备恢复地下核武器试验。他说，美国“在这个问题上将不再受任何君子协定的约束”。他表示美国为此将继续阻挠关于停止核试验的谈判达成协议，以便在“已达到没有取得进展的可能性的地步时，我们（美国）必须照顾自己”。
    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会开始时发表了一个关于刚果局势的简短声明，表示美国要继续利用联合国来实行其控制整个刚果的阴谋。他要求“所有有关方面同联合国忠诚合作”。
    艾森豪威尔在回答有关古巴的问题时，再一次为美国干涉古巴制造借口。他说什么如果在西半球出现所谓“由国际共产主义统治和控制的政府”，美国就将对之采取“非常明确的行动”。他还叫嚷，美国将在“分析”局势以后，“最后定出击败它的办法”。
    在谈到美国的经济状况时，艾森豪威尔自欺欺人地硬说“没有理由认为”美国出现了“任何人们可以称之为衰退或萧条的迹象”。但是，他不得不承认，美国钢铁工业的开工率已从年初的高峰下降到目前的50％，并且“每个人都在注意”。他说，这种“钢产量中忽上忽下的情况”“永远是很讨厌的”。艾森豪威尔还说，美国汽车工业7月份的生产情况也“并不很好”。他承认目前在美国“看不到经济蓬勃发展的情况”。
