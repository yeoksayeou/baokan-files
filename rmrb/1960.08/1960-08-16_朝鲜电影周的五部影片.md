Story Film "To Love the Future"

    Under the fascist rule of the Japanese invaders, the Korean people lived a dark and miserable life. Underground workers, under the leadership of the Party, waged heroic and tenacious struggles against the enemy in enemy-occupied areas in order to save the motherland and rescue the nation from peril. The film portrays the image of a Communist Party member who loves the bright and splendid communist future. Gil-san, the captain of the guerrilla team, under the strong leadership of the Party, bravely and resourcefully led the guerrilla team to inflict continuous and heavy blows on the enemy. Once, while pursuing the enemy, he was unfortunately blinded in both eyes by a grenade. The Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung gave him meticulous care and treatment, which quickly restored his health and strengthened his determination to fight.
    In a battle of great significance, Gil-san led the guerrillas to successfully complete the task of luring the enemy in deep and severely attacking them. Then, he led a platoon to cover the safe retreat of the team, but they themselves fell into the hands of the enemy. The enemy used all kinds of cruel and cunning methods to torture them, but they could not shake the confidence of these fearless revolutionary warriors. They fought unyieldingly. Twenty-year-old Communist Youth League member Jong-ho fulfilled his greatest wish in prison before his execution, gloriously joining the Party. Firmly believing that the final victory would surely belong to the people and that a happy communist tomorrow would surely arrive, they marched to the execution ground with their heads held high, bravely dedicating their precious lives to the cause of human liberation.
Story Film "Nine O'Clock Sharp"

    "Nine O'Clock Sharp" is a story film depicting the struggle of Korean workers against special agents. Root Sam, a foreman at a tractor factory, advanced producer Park Dong-cheol, and the entire factory's workers are all actively working hard to complete 3,500 tractors ahead of schedule in response to the Party's call. However, American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang were unwilling to accept defeat on the battlefield and dispatched special agents and counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the factory to carry out sabotage activities. They used Root Sam's historical stain of having participated in the security forces in the past to coerce him into sabotaging the engine test run, and further attempted to use a time bomb to blow up the entire factory at nine o'clock sharp when the first tractor was to leave the factory. However, the enemy's conspiracy did not succeed. Due to the investigation of the public security personnel and the active assistance of the workers, as well as Root Sam's intense ideological struggle, thinking of the tragic encounter of his wife being killed by the Rhee bandits and the happy life today under the leadership of the Workers' Party, he finally confessed to the organization at the critical moment of planting the bomb, and all the special agents were finally caught.
Color Documentary "Mount Kumgang"

    Mount Kumgang, symbolizing the strong will and beautiful aspirations of the Korean people, is a scenic spot of which the Korean working people are proud and a world-renowned landscape. Today, it is a cultural recreation place for the Korean working people and a tourist attraction loved by international friends. Mount Kumgang has a beautiful and moving scenery, and it varies with the seasons. In spring, the mountains are covered with new buds like green satin, and people call it Kumgangsan; in summer, the green leaves provide shade, and people call it Bongnaesan; in autumn, the mountains are covered with red leaves, and people call it Pungaksan; in winter, the mountains and cliffs are golden and brilliant, and people call it Gaegolsan. The jagged and layered peaks, the rainbow waterfall that rushes down from above the nine heavens, the crystal clear valley pools, the strangely shaped rocks standing in the East Sea, ... all of this constitutes a magnificent picture. The color documentary "Mount Kumgang" not only satisfies our desire to travel to Mount Kumgang, but also gives us a beautiful artistic enjoyment.
Story Film "Song of Unity"

    The workers in a fertilizer factory in a certain area of Korea lived a slave life with no guarantee of survival due to the cruel oppression and rule of the Japanese invaders, and the working conditions were extremely harsh. But the workers did not yield. The more cruel the enemy was, the more it aroused the workers' resistance. Under the leadership of underground party leaders such as Yong-soo, they launched a tenacious struggle against the enemy. Wen-gil, a worker who was originally timid and did not believe in his own strength, also realized that unity is strength, joined the ranks of the struggle, and bravely carried out the struggle. Yong-soo's heroic sacrifice further angered the workers. They carried the body of the martyr, followed in the footsteps of the revolutionary martyrs, held high the red flag, and held a majestic demonstration. Story Film "Kumgang Mountain Girl" The victory of the national liberation war led by the Korean Workers' Party and the establishment of the Republic brought prosperity and happiness to the Korean people. Soon-hee, a beautiful, smart, and lovely Kumgang Mountain girl and a member of the fishery cooperative, not only lived a happy life with her mother, but also became a member of the art troupe who could sing and dance under the cultivation of the Party and the people. Once, because of her successful performance in the dance drama "Kumgang Mountain Girl" presented to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country, the audience requested her to perform again. One of her folk songs aroused the memory of Hwang Seok-po, the creator of "Kumgang Mountain Girl". It turned out that Hwang Seok-po was Soon-hee's father, Kim Cheol-soo. He and his wife, Myung-hee, were both excellent musicians. In the days of resisting the bloody oppression of the Japanese invaders, he painfully parted with the pregnant Myung-hee, changed his name to Hwang Seok-po, and joined the guerrilla team. Under the cultivation of the Party and in the long-term struggle against the enemy, Cheol-soo was tempered into a strong revolutionary fighter and a people's composer. This performance allowed their family to celebrate the reunion of their flesh and blood on the day when the whole country celebrated the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country.
