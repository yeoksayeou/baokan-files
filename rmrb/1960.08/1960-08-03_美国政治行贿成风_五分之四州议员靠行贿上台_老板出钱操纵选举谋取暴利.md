    Rampant Bribery in American Politics
    Four-Fifths of State Legislators Elected Through Bribery; Bosses Use Money to Manipulate Elections for Huge Profits
    The American "Reader's Digest" in its August issue published an article by an American state legislator entitled "This is How Political Bribery is Done." The article blatantly exposes the ugly scandal of buying official positions with money that prevails in the United States.
    This state legislator shamelessly said, "I read in the newspapers that bribery is an illegal act, but in my state, as well as in many other states, bribery can help in legislation. If it weren't for bribery, four-fifths of my colleagues wouldn't be able to get elected." He said that a state legislator candidate must spend between two thousand and twenty-five thousand dollars to carry out an election campaign.
    The author said that each legislator must have two people to buy votes. In the state capital alone, there are nearly one hundred and fifty agents of oil, railway, and brewing companies, as well as racetrack owners and various merchants who are "appointed" to buy votes. These people first pay for the election campaign, and then they can rely on the elected officials as their backers to make a fortune.
    The author calls these people the "Third House," and the "Third House" often has greater power in passing bills than the other two houses of the state (the Senate and the House of Representatives).
    The author said that after he was elected as a state legislator, a colleague from a neighboring district said to him: "If you are a smart man, you should vote for Green when electing the speaker, because the Third House has already collected enough votes to elect Green."
    The author said: "After I came to the capital, I didn't need to pay for hotel and meal expenses. The people who bought votes always paid for me, so I chose the best hotels and restaurants in the city… Some other legislators also lived like kings, living in spacious rooms, where food, drinks, laundry, and even pleasant socializing were paid for by the Third House."

### 美国政治行贿成风  五分之四州议员靠行贿上台  老板出钱操纵选举谋取暴利

    美国政治行贿成风
    五分之四州议员靠行贿上台  老板出钱操纵选举谋取暴利
    美国八月号的“读者文摘”发表了美国的一个州议员写的文章，题目是“政治贿赂就是这样进行的”。文章明显地暴露了美国盛行的用金钱收买官职的丑事。
    这个州议员恬不知耻地说，“我从报上看到，说贿赂是一种违法行为，但是，在我的州，以及其他许多州，贿赂却可以帮助立法。如果不是行贿，我的五分之四的同行都不能当选。”他说，一个州议员候选人开展竞选运动必须花费二千到二万五千美元。
    作者说，每个议员要有两个收买选票的人。仅州首府就有将近一百五十名石油、铁路、酿酒公司的代理人，以及赛马场老板和各种商人被“委任”来收买选票。这些人先为竞选运动出钱，然后就可以靠当选者作后台大捞一把。
    作者把这些人称为“第三院”，“第三院”在通过法案方面比州的另外两院（参议院和众议院）往往有更大的势力。
    作者说，他当选州议员以后邻区的一个同行对他说：“如果你是一位聪明人，你应该在选举议长时投格林的票，因为第三院已经收集了足够的票数使格林当选。”
    作者说：“我来到首府后不需要交旅馆费和饭费，收买选票的人总是替我付款，于是我挑选了城市最上等的旅馆饭店……另一些议员也住得像国王一样，他们住着宽敞的房间，这里的食品、饮料、洗衣，甚至愉快的交际也由第三院来出钱。”　（新华社）（附图片）
