    Reduce Labor Intensity, Improve Production Efficiency
    Vietnam's "Cart Movement" Progresses Rapidly
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 5th: In order to liberate shoulders, reduce labor intensity, and improve work efficiency, the "Cart Movement" launched in North Vietnam is being welcomed by the majority of workers and farmers and is making rapid progress.
    According to the summary meeting of the movement to improve technology and liberate shoulders in the entire North, recently held in Hanoi, all construction sites and some rural areas in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region have fully realized cartization. In the past three months alone, more than 900 various types of carts were manufactured at various construction sites in the autonomous region. At the Tiao Nai construction site in Xuan Quang province, more than 1,200 laborers made nearly 700 carts in five days, increasing work efficiency by two to twenty times.
    In the cartization movement, workers and farmers have made various forms of carts according to different conditions. Tao Wen Si, a worker at the Transportation Department Repair Factory in Taiyuan County, created a two-person cart that can automatically dump the contents of the basket by using the bamboo poles on the cart, which is both convenient and reduces labor intensity. The wide-wheeled wheelbarrow manufactured in the salt-producing area of ​​Nam Dinh Province can travel on lawns and muddy roads. A type of cart manufactured in Ho Dinh Province can be fitted with double wheels when traveling on the main road, and the double wheels can be combined into a single wheel when traveling on narrow roads.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 6th: According to preliminary materials released by the Vietnamese Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, and the Geological Bureau, 28 enterprises, construction sites, and exploration teams in North Vietnam have overfulfilled their July production plans by 2.3% to 41.2%.
    According to today's newspapers, these enterprises include important enterprises such as the Nam Dinh Textile Factory, the Hai Phong Cement Factory, the Cao Bang Tin Mine, and the Hanoi Power Plant. In July, the labor emulation movement among workers was further developed. Workers responded to the challenge of working according to socialist principles put forward by the Taiyuan No. 8 Exploration Team and launched an emulation campaign. Many enterprises, construction sites, and exploration teams waged a tenacious struggle against continuous rain, overcoming various difficulties, and ensuring the smooth progress of production.

    减轻劳动强度　提高生产效率
    越南“车子化运动”进展迅速
    新华社河内5日电　越南北方为了解放双肩、减轻劳动强度、提高工作效率而开展的“车子化运动”，正受到广大工人和农民的欢迎，并且获得迅速的进展。
    据最近在河内召开的全北方改进技术、解放双肩运动总结会议宣布，越北自治区所有的建筑工地和一些农村，已经全部实现了车子化。仅在最近三个月内，这个自治区各工地制造的各种车子就有九百多辆。宣光省的条乃工地的一千二百多名民工在五天内就制成了近七百辆车子，使工作效率提高了两倍到二十倍。
    工人、农民们在车子化运动中，根据不同条件作出了各种形式的车子。太原县交通司修理厂工人陶文泗创造的双人小推车，可以利用车上的竹竿，把筐内的东西自动倾倒出来，既方便，又减轻了劳动强度。南定省产盐区制造的宽轮独轮车，可以在草坪上和泥泞的道路上行走。河定省制造的一种车子在大路上行走时，可以装上双轮，走窄路时，又可以把双轮合起来成为单轮。
    新华社河内6日电　据越南重工业部、轻工业部和地质局初步公布的材料，越南北方已有二十八个企业、建筑工地和勘探队超额2.3％到41.2％完成了7月份生产计划。
    据今天报纸报道，在这些企业当中有南定纺织厂、海防水泥厂、高平锡矿、河内发电厂等重要企业。在7月份里，工人们的劳动竞赛运动有了进一步的开展。工人们响应太原第八勘探队提出的按社会主义原则进行工作的挑战，展开竞赛。许多企业工地，勘探队，同连绵阴雨进行了顽强的斗争，克服种种困难，保证了生产的顺利进行。
