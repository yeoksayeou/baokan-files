Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 16th: Kim Kwang-hyup, Minister of National Defense of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued an order to the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army on August 15th, instructing them to never relax their vigilance against the aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, to be strongly prepared, and to be able to repel the aggressors at any time, and to gloriously fulfill the task of defending the socialist motherland.

In the order, Minister Kim Kwang-hyup reviewed the brilliant achievements made by the Korean people under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers’ Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung in the fifteen years since liberation. The order stated, "All these victories and achievements are the result of our Party consistently adhering to Marxist-Leninist principles, creatively applying them to the reality of our country, and wisely leading the masses of the people."

The order stated: "In his historic speech on the 15th anniversary of the 'August 15th' liberation, Comrade Kim Il-sung summarized the great achievements of our people and correctly put forward the magnificent program of the seven-year perspective plan for the development of the national economy and the new political program for promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland. This will even more powerfully inspire our people, who are fighting for the reunification and prosperity of the motherland, to move towards new victories."

In the order, Minister Kim Kwang-hyup pointed out that U.S. imperialism is desperately blocking the path for the Korean people to peacefully reunify their motherland and live and work in peace on one territory, and is continuing to intensify dangerous military provocations in order to seize the fruits of our people's socialist victory.

However, no conspiracy of the U.S. imperialist aggressors can stop our people's solemn struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic.

The Korean people will surely be victorious in ending the occupation of South Korea by the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops and realizing the revolutionary cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Minister Kim Kwang-hyup said in the order that today, the revolutionary forces of the people in the northern half of the Republic are infinitely strong, and the Korean People's Army, which has inherited the revolutionary traditions of the anti-Japanese guerrillas and has grown into a steel army under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, is firmly guarding the outpost for defending our revolutionary cause.

We have the strong support and solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union; hundreds of millions of oppressed people in Asia and Africa and all kind people around the world also stand firmly on the side of the Korean people.

He pointed out: If the enemy ignores the stark reality and launches another war against our people, it can only bring them a devastating defeat.

The order requires all officers and soldiers of the People's Army to be loyal to the Party and the socialist motherland, to highly enhance their class consciousness to resolutely fight for the victory of the revolution, to firmly arm themselves with communist ideology, to maintain combat vigilance, to complete daily combat preparations, to strengthen combat and political training in every possible way, to further improve military technical level, to carry forward the traditional style of unity between the army and the people and unity between officers and soldiers, which is an important source of strength for the People's Army, and to strengthen in every possible way the internationalist friendship and solidarity with the people and armies of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries.

The order said: "I am confident that you will be united as one around the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, and will consistently and gloriously fulfill the task of defending the socialist motherland."

    时刻准备反击美帝国主义的侵略
    新华社平壤16日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国民族保卫相金光侠大将在8月15日向朝鲜人民军官兵发布了命令，命令朝鲜人民军一时也不放松对美帝国主义侵略阴谋的警惕，坚强地准备着，在任何时候都能给侵略者以反击，光荣地执行保卫社会主义祖国的任务。
    金光侠大将在命令中回顾了解放后十五年来朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党中央委员会的英明领导下所取得的辉煌成就。命令说，“这一切胜利和成就，是由于我们党一贯坚持马列主义原则，创造性地把它运用到我国的现实，英明地领导了人民群众的结果。”
    命令说：“金日成同志在‘八·一五’解放十五周年时作的历史性演说中总结了我们人民取得的伟大成就，并正确地提出了人民经济发展七年展望计划的宏伟纲领和促进祖国和平统一的新的政治纲领。这更加有力地鼓舞为实现祖国的统一和繁荣进行斗争的我们人民走向新的胜利。”
    金光侠大将在命令中指出：美帝国主义者拼命地堵塞朝鲜人民和平统一祖国、在一个国土上安居乐业的道路，并为夺取我们人民的社会主义胜利果实，继续加剧危险的军事挑衅。
    但是，美帝国主义侵略者的任何阴谋也不能阻挡我们人民和平统一祖国和在共和国北半部进行的社会主义建设的庄严斗争。
    朝鲜人民为结束美帝国主义侵略军对南朝鲜的强占，和实现和平统一祖国的革命事业必将胜利。
    金光侠大将在命令中说，今天，在共和国北半部人民的革命力量无限强大，继承了抗日游击队的革命传统的、在朝鲜劳动党的领导下成长壮大为钢铁军队的朝鲜人民军坚守在保卫我们革命事业的前哨。
    我们有着以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的强大的支持和声援；亚洲、非洲的亿万被压迫人民以及全世界一切善良的人民也牢固地站在朝鲜人民这一边。
    他指出：如果敌人无视俨然的现实，重新发起反对我们人民的战争，那只能给它们带来毁灭性的惨败。
    命令要求全体人民军官兵忠于党和社会主义祖国，高度地提高为革命胜利坚决斗争的阶级觉悟，以共产主义思想牢固地武装起来，保持战斗警惕性，完成日常的战斗准备，千方百计地加强战斗和政治训练，进一步提高军事技术水平，发扬人民军队力量的重要源泉的军民一致、官兵一致的传统风格，百般地加强同苏联、中华人民共和国及其他社会主义国家人民和军队之间的国际主义友谊团结。
    命令说：“我确信你们钢铁般地团结在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党中央委员会周围，一贯光荣地执行保卫社会主义祖国的任务。”
