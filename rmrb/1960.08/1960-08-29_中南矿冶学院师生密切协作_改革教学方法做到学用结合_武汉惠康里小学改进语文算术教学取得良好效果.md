The Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, while reforming the teaching content, has also reformed its teaching methods, greatly improving the quality of teaching.

The reform of teaching methods at this institute has been carried out in the following three aspects: First, for general theoretical courses, a "one-stop unit teaching method" is adopted, which divides the course into several units (chapters) and teaches them continuously, so that students can concentrate their thoughts and energy when mastering a subject, and be able to learn deeply and thoroughly. In the past, students accepted three or four subjects within eight hours, and students' thinking activities were erratic, making it difficult to learn deeply. The adoption of the "one-stop unit teaching method" has overcome this phenomenon.

Second, for courses with strong technical content, the method of "single-subject advance, concentrated assault" is adopted. The characteristic of this teaching method is to concentrate time and energy, combine with production, and carry out teaching with "real swords and guns."

Third, for courses that require mastering equipment performance and operation technology, as well as the entire production process, the method of strengthening intuitive teaching and on-site teaching is adopted. For example, strengthen model teaching aids for crystal structure and ore deposit genesis; strengthen laboratory teaching for thermal measurement, automatic regulation, crushing and screening; and participate in factory and mine production labor and technical innovation and technical revolution activities for on-site teaching of professional overview courses and production processes.

In the reform of teaching methods, this institute adheres to the leadership of the Party committee, combines teachers and students, and conducts large-scale collaboration to jointly attack scientific fortresses. For example, the "similarity principle" in metallurgical furnaces was previously difficult for teachers to teach and difficult for students to learn. Now, the "one-stop unit teaching method" is adopted, and teachers and students are combined. When students preview, teachers participate personally. In the "key lectures," teachers focus on the main contradictions and concentrate on guiding and helping students to overcome difficulties and attack key points. During the review, students give play to their initiative and look at textbooks and reference books separately, and teachers also discuss with students. Now students say: "The similarity principle is not difficult to learn" anymore.

This institute uses new teaching methods to better achieve learning by doing, learning by application, and the integration of learning and application. Mechanical drawing adopts the method of factory-school linkage and collaboration, combined with production for teaching, and has achieved remarkable results. In fifty-two days, the twenty-seven first-year classes of students, who learned on-site in factories, design institutes, and affiliated factories of the institute in Changsha, not only completed the courses they should learn, but also completed twelve major production design tasks such as precision instrument lathes and rolling mills, and drew production drawings for more than 1,000 parts, directly creating wealth for the country.

Due to the reform of teaching content and teaching methods, the teaching time of various courses in this institute has also been appropriately shortened, and the quality has been greatly improved. The speed of doing exercises is generally two to three times faster.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. Huikangli Elementary School in Wuhan has innovated teaching and carried out teaching reform experiments in language and arithmetic in three first-grade classes, and has achieved good results.

Huikangli Elementary School began its teaching reform experiment work in the autumn of last year. Over the past year, new teaching content and teaching methods have been continuously adopted, the teaching speed has been accelerated, and the teaching quality has been significantly improved.

The most important feature of Huikangli Elementary School in carrying out teaching reform is to give full play to children's subjective initiative and learning consciousness, and improve children's thinking ability, according to the development of children's intelligence. Their specific methods are: In language teaching, the method of concentrated literacy is boldly adopted, and all the new words in a unit course are concentrated together, and taught using picture reading methods, combined with children's life practice, so that children can quickly read the pronunciation of words and understand their meanings. Then, using methods such as homophone classification and radical concentration, the words and phrases in the text are concentrated and classified for teaching, so that children can consolidate more new words and vocabulary through association and analysis comparison. For example, when teaching "Flies and Mosquitoes" selected from the third-grade textbook, only four class hours were spent due to the above methods, and the students learned sixty-two new words and eighteen new words. In arithmetic teaching, they reformed the repetitive and cumbersome textbooks of the past. For example, most first-grade students can calculate addition and subtraction within ten, while in the old teaching, it still took twenty-one class hours to teach children the number method, reading method, and writing method, and fifteen class hours to teach the calculation of addition and subtraction within ten. They also reduced some class hours and increased the teaching content according to children's intellectual development. For example, after teaching addition and subtraction within twenty, they immediately combined children's life experience to carry out multiplication and division within twenty in the second-grade curriculum, and at the same time carried out addition and subtraction within one hundred, completing the tasks that required thirty class hours in the past in fourteen class hours. In terms of teaching methods, special attention is also paid to combining children's life practice and enlightening children's thinking ability, with good results, so that first-grade students can generally mentally calculate three-digit addition and subtraction and mentally calculate two-digit multiplication and division within a hundred.

    中南矿冶学院师生密切协作
    改革教学方法做到学用结合
    武汉惠康里小学改进语文算术教学取得良好效果
    本报讯　中南矿冶学院在改革教学内容的同时，对教学方法也进行了改革，大大提高了教学质量。
    这个学院对教学方法的改革，从下列三个方面进行：一、对一般的理论课程，采用“一条龙单元教学法”，就是把课程分成若干单元（章），连续地进行教学，使学生在掌握一门知识时思想和精力集中，能够学深学透。过去学生在八小时内接受三、四门知识，学生思维活动忽东忽西，因此学习不易深透。采用“一条龙单元教学法”以后，便克服了这种现象。
    二、对技术性较强的课程，采取“单科独进、集中突击”的方法。这种教学方法的特点是集中时间、集中精力，结合生产，“真刀真枪”进行教学。
    三、对于要求掌握设备性能和操作技术、整个生产工艺流程部分的课程，采取加强直观教学和现场教学的办法。例如，对结晶构造、矿床成因等加强模型教具教学；对热工测量、自动调节、破碎筛分加强实验室教学；对专业的概论课程和生产工艺则采取参加厂矿生产劳动和技术革新、技术革命活动进行现场教学。
    这个学院在改革教学方法中，坚持了在党委领导下，师生结合，进行大协作，同攻科学堡垒。如冶金炉中的
  “相似原理”，过去教师一直感到难教，学生也感到难学。现在采取了
  “一条龙单元教学法”，师生结合，学生预习时，教师亲自参加，在“重点讲授”中，教师就抓住主要矛盾，集中地引导和帮助同学们破难关、攻难点；复习时，同学们发挥主动精神，分头看教科书和参考书，教师也和同学一起讨论，现在同学们反映：
  “相似原理并不难学”了。
    这个学院采用新的教学方法，更好地做到了边做边学，边学边用，学用结合。机械制图采取厂校挂钩协作、结合生产进行教学的办法，收到显著效果。一年级二十七个班的同学在长沙市的工厂、设计院和该院附属工厂等单位进行现场学习，五十二天内不仅教完了应学课程，而且完成了精密仪表车床、轧钢机等十二项较大生产设计任务，绘制了一千多种零件的生产图纸，直接为国家创造了财富。
    这个学院由于改革了教学内容和教学方法，各种课程教学时间也相应地适当缩短，质量大为提高，一般做习题速度快二至三倍。
    本报讯　武汉市惠康里小学革新教学，在一年级三个班进行语文、算术两科的教学改革试验工作，已取得良好效果。
    惠康里小学是从去年秋天开始进行教学改革试验工作的。一年来，不断采用新的教学内容和教学方法，教学速度加快，教学质量显著提高。
    惠康里小学在进行教学改革中，最重要的特点是根据儿童智力发展，充分发挥儿童的主观能动性和学习的自觉性，提高儿童的思维能力。他们的具体作法是：在语文教学中，大胆地采取了集中识字的办法，把一个单元课程中所有的生字集中起来，用看图识字的方法，结合儿童的生活实际进行教学，使儿童很快就能读出字音、理解字义。然后用同音归类、偏旁部首集中等方法，把课文中字、词集中分类进行教学，使儿童通过联想和分析比较，巩固地掌握更多的生字和词汇。例如，在教从三年级课文中选出来的“苍蝇和蚊子”一课时，由于采用上述方法，只花了四个课时，学生就学会了六十二个生字和十八个新词。在算术教学中，他们改革了过去重复、繁琐的教材，如一年级大部分学生都能计算十以内的加减法，而旧的教学中却仍然要花二十一课时教儿童数法、读法和写法，教计算十以内的加减法时，还得花十五课时。他们还根据儿童的智力发展，缩减了部分课时，增加了教学内容，如在教完二十以内的加减法后，紧接着就结合儿童的生活经验进行二年级课程中二十以内的乘除法，同时进行一百以内的加减法，以十四课时教完了过去需三十课时的任务。在教学方法上，也特别注意结合儿童生活实际，启发儿童的思维能力，效果良好，使一年级学生一般都能口算三位数的加减法和口算百以内的两位乘除法。（附图片）
