    Great Ambition
    Meiyuan
    Gao Likong, a Communist Party member from Xinliangdi Village, Yongchang County, Gansu Province, was determined to "start from scratch" and established a primary school, which he ran very successfully. This school gradually solved students' tuition fees through work-study programs, gradually achieved self-sufficiency in student food, and also solved part of the students' clothing needs. Through political and ideological education and a reasonable arrangement of study, work, and rest time, the students were ideologically healthy, and their academic performance, after testing, ranked first in the county.

    Some people like to enjoy ready-made things when doing things and working. Want to start a school? He would say: First, there must be funding to build decent school buildings; second, there must be decent teachers; and so on. In short, they are willing to do things and work only after all conditions are met.

    However, the face of our country is originally "poor and blank." Under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to obtain a large amount of funding for all undertakings, and it is impossible to obtain a large number of highly educated and professionally knowledgeable talents. What to do? Step back in the face of difficulties? Then we will never be able to change the "poor and blank" face, and we will always be bullied by imperialism.

    To make revolution, we must have revolutionary aspirations and revolutionary drive. Are objective conditions bad? We can work hard, study diligently, and change or create the necessary conditions. To do a good job or complete a task, certain conditions are of course required; these conditions, as long as they are based on objective possibilities, can be created with persistent efforts. It is possible to go from no conditions to having conditions, from poor conditions to good conditions. Revolution and construction always have such and such difficulties, just as the Party branch secretary where Gao Likong was located said to him: "How can there be no difficulties in making revolution? Communists should move forward in overcoming all difficulties, otherwise, what do we need to do?" And all difficulties are like the worker's poem sings: "Difficulty is a stone, effort is a sledgehammer; the sledgehammer strikes the stone, and the stone bows its head." When encountering difficulties in revolution and construction, whether you can smash it depends on whether you have the confidence, determination, and ambition to smash it, and whether you dare to raise the revolutionary "sledgehammer." In a word, it depends on whether you have revolutionary drive and courage. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people have the heroic spirit to despise and overcome all difficulties on the road forward. Gao Likong is one who possesses this heroic spirit. Without funding or equipment, relying on the Party and the masses, he used poor methods to transform a dilapidated temple into a school, found broken bricks and earth to build desks and benches, used pot ink to brush "blackboards" on the walls, and made mud sticks from white soil to replace chalk. Having never taught before, he went to class during the day and went to the nearest school, which was also five miles away, to study across the desert beaches with many wild wolves and will-o'-the-wisps, acting as both a teacher and a student, studying diligently, improving his professional skills, and conducting teaching. Some parents were unable to supply their children's tuition fees, so he gradually solved the students' tuition fees and other school expenses through work-study programs. The villagers praised: "This kind of school that does not require state funding, does not require parents to pay tuition, and cultivates children to be both literate and martial, is just what we want."

    Some people in the world look down on "poor sticks." However, the "poor sticks" had great ambitions, gave full play to their revolutionary drive, and worked hard and earnestly, and they started the cause they wanted to do. The truth is this: poor but ambitious, striving to become strong, and working hard and steadily will lead to great achievements and great hope.

    大志
    梅原
    甘肃省永昌县新粮地村的共产党员高立孔，立志“白手起家”，办起了一所小学，而且办得很出色：这所学校通过勤工俭学的途径，逐步解决了学生的学习费，逐步实现了学生吃粮自给自足，并解决了学生的部分穿衣问题；这所学校通过政治思想教育和合理地安排学习、劳动与休息时间，学生思想健康，学习成绩经过测验，在全县占第一。
    有的人办事情、做工作喜欢享现成。要办学校吗？他会说：首先要有经费，建起像样的校舍；其次要有像样的教师；等等。总之，他们在一切条件都具备了以后才肯去办事情、做工作。
    但是，我们国家的面貌本来就是“一穷二白”。在这种情况下，我们办一切事业，不可能都得到大量经费，不可能都得到大量有高度文化有业务知识的人材。怎么办呢？在困难面前却步不前吗？那么我们永远也无法改变“一穷二白”的面貌，永远要受帝国主义的欺侮。
    要革命，就得有革命的志气，就得有革命的干劲。客观条件不好吗？我们可以艰苦奋斗，勤学苦练，改变或是创造必要的条件。为做好某一件工作、完成某一项任务，当然需要一定的条件；这些条件，只要在客观可能性的基础上，坚持不懈地努力是可以创造的。可以从没有条件到有条件，从条件差到条件好。革命和建设，总是有这样那样的困难的，正如高立孔所在的党支部书记对他所说：“干革命，怎能没有困难呢？共产党员应该在排除万难中前进，不然，还要我们干什么呢？”而一切困难，又正像工人诗歌里唱的：“困难是石头，干劲是鎯头；鎯头敲石头，石头就低头。”在革命和建设中遇到困难，能不能粉碎它，就看你有没有粉碎它的信心、决心和志气，敢不敢举起那革命的“鎯头”。一句话，看你有没有革命的干劲和胆略。我们中国人民在共产党的领导下，是有藐视和克服前进道路上一切困难的英雄气概的。高立孔就是具有这种英雄气概的一个。没有经费，没有设备，依靠党和群众，用穷办法改破庙为学校，找破砖土块垒桌凳，用锅墨在墙上刷“黑板”，用白土搓成泥棒代替粉笔。没有教过书，他就白天上课，晚上穿过野狼、磷火很多的荒漠的沙滩到最近的、但也是在五里地外的学校去学习，既当先生，又当学生，勤学苦练，提高业务，进行教学。有些家长不大能供应自己孩子的学习费用，他就通过勤工俭学的办法，逐步地解决了学生的学习费用和学校的其他开支。村里人赞扬说：“这种不要国家出钱，不要家长交学费，又把孩子培养得能文能武的学堂，才正合我们的心意。”
    天下有些人是看不起“穷棒子”的。但是，“穷棒子”立了大志，发挥了革命干劲，扎扎实实地干，却把要干的事业干起来了。真理就是这样的：穷而有志，发愤图强，踏实苦干，就会大有出息，大有希望。
