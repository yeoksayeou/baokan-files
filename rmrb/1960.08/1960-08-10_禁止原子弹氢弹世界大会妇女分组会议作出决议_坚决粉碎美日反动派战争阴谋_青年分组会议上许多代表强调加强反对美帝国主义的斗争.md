Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The Women's Group Meeting of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament adopted a resolution stating that women should do everything in their power to crush the conspiracy of US imperialists and Japanese reactionaries to prepare for a new war and invalidate the US-Japan military alliance.

    About one thousand Japanese women and thirteen foreign women representatives attended the meeting. Many representatives spoke in succession, exposing how US imperialists and Japanese reactionaries are preparing for a new war. They also pointed out that the US-Japan military alliance treaty brings various misfortunes to women and children.

    A women's representative from Okinawa emphasized that the Japanese people should force the United States to withdraw from the largest base in the world, the Okinawa base, and return Okinawa to Japan.

    Soviet representative Asayeva said that people of all countries should now bravely fight against US imperialism and reviving fascism.

    Chinese representative Huang Ganying emphasized that Chinese women deeply respect Japanese women who actively participate in the movement against the US-Japan military alliance treaty and against atomic and hydrogen bombs. She said: "The struggle of Japanese women against the military alliance will definitely receive the full sympathy of Chinese women."

    Huang Ganying continued: "It is correct for Japanese women to combine the struggle against atomic bombs, against bases, and against the 'security treaty,' recognizing the relationship between these struggles."

    US women's representative Yoneda said that the call for peace from the American people is getting louder and louder. "Restoring China's legitimate position in the United Nations is an urgent need for peace." After her speech, she presented gifts to the Chinese and Soviet delegations on behalf of the peace-loving women of the United States.

    Ceylonese representative Gunawardana pledged in her speech that she would do everything possible to carry out a campaign to help Japanese atomic bomb victims.

    West German representative Kohlberg spoke about the struggle of West German women, saying that West German women have drawn many valuable experiences from the struggle of Japanese women against the US-Japan "Security Treaty."

    Xinhua News Agency, 9th, Tokyo dispatch: The Youth Group Meeting, attended by eight hundred young people, discussed the relationship between the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" and the future of Japanese youth.

    The main speech on this issue pointed out that the long-term and unremitting anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement has played a huge role in the Japanese people's great struggle against the "Security Treaty." The main speech also emphasized: "Due to the upsurge in the Japanese people's struggle against the 'Security Treaty,' this world conference has been able to be held as successfully as we have seen."

    Many young representatives said that as time goes on, unified youth action is receiving more and more support. They expressed confidence in crushing the reactionaries' attacks on the vigorously developing youth movement across the country.

    A young teacher from a coal mining city in Hokkaido said that the youth in the city have gained such confidence in the struggle against the "Security Treaty" that they will achieve their goal sooner or later. He emphasized that youth should stand at the forefront in the unified action against US imperialists.

    The speech by the Okinawa youth representative attracted the attention of the representatives. He strongly demanded that all Japanese youth stand up to defend peace and strive to return Okinawa to Japan. He exclaimed: "Is Japan independent when many US military bases exist in Okinawa, Japan's indivisible territory? Don't you feel insulted when you think about the US occupying Okinawa?"

    The three foreign representatives attending the youth meeting were Anderson and Kuzmin, representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and Oginga Otinga, representative of Kenya. Anderson called on the delegates to continue the uncompromising struggle against US imperialists.

    The speech by Kim Kyung-chul, chairman of the League of Korean Youth in Japan, aroused the warmest cheers. He said that the people of Asia have learned at the cost of blood that US imperialism is the common enemy of the people of all Asian countries. He cited a large number of facts about the atrocities of US imperialists in Korea and facts illustrating their pursuit of war policies to prove this conclusion.
