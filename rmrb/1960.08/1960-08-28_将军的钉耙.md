    The General's Rake
    This rake is an extremely simple vegetable gardening tool. The handle is long gone, and the rake teeth are incomplete and uneven. During the Anti-Japanese War, when the New Fourth Army headquarters was stationed in Huanghuatang, Xuyi County, East China, Commander Chen Yi would use this rake to grow vegetables during breaks from combat.
    During the arduous years of the Anti-Japanese War, in order to overcome extremely serious material difficulties and to reduce the burden on the people, the troops, from generals to soldiers, all participated in the great production movement. At that time, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army were undertaking heavy combat tasks, but they still used the gaps between battles to reclaim wasteland for farming, raise pigs, grow vegetables, spin yarn, make shoes, and even establish factories and workshops. The combination of combat and production was a lively and enthusiastic endeavor.
    At that time, Comrade Chen Yi had very little rest time, but whenever he had free time, he would go to the fields to grow vegetables, roll up his trousers, go barefoot, and work until he was covered in sweat. In order to take care of the commander's rest, the guards would sometimes quietly water and weed in the commander's field. On one occasion, he was "caught" by the commander on the spot:
    "Haha, no wonder there are so few weeds in my field!"
    Not many days later, Comrade Chen Yi opened up another piece of wasteland at the end of his field, and he waved this rake at the comrades and said:
    "My 'base area' has new developments!"

### 将军的钉耙

    将军的钉耙
    这钉耙，是一个极其简单的种菜工具。耙柄早已失去，耙钉也残缺不齐了。抗日战争期间，新四军军部驻在华东盱眙县黄花塘时，陈毅军长在战斗空隙就用这耙来种菜。
    在抗战的艰苦岁月里，为了战胜极端严重的物质困难，为了减轻人民负担，部队从将军到士兵，人人都投入了大生产运动。当时八路军和新四军担负着繁重的战斗任务，但仍利用战斗的空隙，开荒种地，养猪种菜，纺纱做鞋，甚至建立工厂作坊。战斗和生产两结合，搞得热火朝天。
    当时陈毅同志休息时间很少，但他一有空就到地里种菜，挽起裤腿光着脚，劳动得汗流浃背。警卫员为了照顾首长休息，有时悄悄地到军长的地里浇水、锄草。有一次被军长当场“抓”住了：
    “哈哈，怪不得我的地里草这么少！”
    没过几天，陈毅同志在他的地头又开出一块荒地，他挥着这只钉耙对同志们说：
    “我的‘根据地’又有新的发展了！”
