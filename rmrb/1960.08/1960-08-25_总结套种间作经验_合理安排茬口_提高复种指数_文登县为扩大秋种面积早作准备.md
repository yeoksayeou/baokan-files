Summarize Intercropping Experience, Rationally Arrange Crop Rotations, and Improve Multiple Cropping Index
Wendeng County Makes Early Preparations for Expanding Autumn Planting Area

(Reported by our newspaper) The Wendeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in discussing the autumn planting plan, summarized the successful experience of intercropping crops in the past two years and decided to prepare for a greater promotion of intercropping in the coming year's autumn planting. Based on this requirement, a specific autumn planting plan was formulated.

In the past two years, Wendeng County has systematically experimented with and gradually promoted intercropping. As of this year, the county has implemented the following five types of crop intercropping: peanuts intercropped in wheat fields, summer corn intercropped in wheat fields, wheat intercropped in radish and cabbage fields, barley and peas intercropped in spring sweet potato fields, and summer sweet potatoes intercropped in wheat fields. Among them, except for the barley and peas intercropped in spring sweet potato fields, and the summer sweet potatoes intercropped in wheat fields, which are still in the experimental stage this year, the other three types have been widely promoted this year. For example, wheat intercropped with peanuts covers 56,000 mu, wheat intercropped with summer corn covers 43,000 mu, and wheat intercropped with radish and cabbage fields covers 25,000 mu. Practice has proven that these intercropping methods have achieved the following three significant effects:

First, it can expand the multiple cropping area of land and resolve the contradiction between grain and oil crop land use, thereby realizing an overall leap forward in grain and oil production. Although Wendeng County is a region with limited land and a large population, the multiple cropping area of the land has historically been small. Until 1957, the multiple cropping index of the land was only slightly above 137%. This has greatly limited agricultural production increases. The county is also a peanut-producing area. According to national planning requirements, the peanut planting area must be effectively guaranteed. However, without expanding the multiple cropping area, ensuring the peanut planting area would inevitably mean that the grain field area could not be increased, hindering diversified planting and increased harvests. Implementing the above-mentioned intercropping cultivation methods effectively solves this problem. For example, intercropping peanuts with wheat allows peanuts, which originally could only be grown once a year, to be planted in fields that yield two crops a year, thereby expanding the planting area for grain or other crops. Intercropping wheat in radish and cabbage fields can also turn spring land, which should have been left for one crop a year in the coming year, into land that is autumn-sown in the current year and harvested twice in the coming year, thereby expanding the multiple cropping area. This year, as a result of promoting intercropping, compared with 1959, although the cultivated land area has decreased due to land occupation by basic construction, the planting area has still increased, and the multiple cropping index has also increased from 142% to 151%.

Second, it can ensure and increase the yield of summer-sown crops. Due to late harvesting of summer crops and labor shortages, it is often difficult for the county to plant summer-sown crops in a timely manner, which greatly affects yields. Advance intercropping of summer corn can ensure timely sowing and increase yields. Pre-harvest intercropping of summer peanuts before the wheat harvest can also increase yields by extending the growing season of summer peanuts.

Third, it can adjust the use of labor and, to a certain extent, solve the problem of labor shortages during periods of concentrated agricultural work.

Due to the significant effects of intercropping and interplanting, it has been supported by the vast number of cadres and commune members. Recently, at an enlarged county party committee meeting attended by the first secretaries of the commune party committees, the issue of promoting intercropping on a larger scale and expanding the autumn planting area next year was emphasized during the discussion of the autumn planting plan. Based on the requirements of intercropping, specific plans for various intercropping and interplanting methods were stipulated for this year's autumn planting. In this way, the planting area and the multiple cropping index of cultivated land in the county next year will be further improved compared to this year. Implementing crop intercropping is an innovation in the cultivation system, and the quality of cultivation specifications and various measures must also be reformed accordingly. The county party committee emphasized in the autumn planting plan that all preparations must be made before autumn planting according to the requirements of intercropping. First of all, ideological mobilization work must be done well to further enable cadres and commune members to generally recognize the benefits of intercropping, so as to consciously and actively carry out this reform of the cultivation system. Secondly, in terms of measures, it is necessary to further accumulate and manufacture large amounts of fertilizer to increase the amount of fertilization and adapt to the requirements of expanding the multiple cropping area. The preparation of tillage and sowing tools must also adapt to the requirements of intercropping. The two-legged wide-width close-planting drill, the three-legged wide-width close-planting drill, the five-legged close-planting drill, and the ten-row seeder must be fully prepared and integrated to ensure that whatever tools are needed are available, so as to guarantee the completion of autumn planting and next year's intercropping tasks.

### 总结套种间作经验　合理安排茬口　提高复种指数  文登县为扩大秋种面积早作准备

    总结套种间作经验　合理安排茬口　提高复种指数
    文登县为扩大秋种面积早作准备
    本报讯　中共山东文登县委在讨论秋播规划中，总结了近两年实行农作物套作的成功经验，决定在今年秋播中，要为明年更多地推行套作做好准备。并根据这一要求，制订了具体的秋播规划。
    两年来，文登县有计划地试验并且逐步推广套作。到今年为止，全县已经实行了如下五种农作物套作，即：小麦地里套作花生，小麦地里套作夏玉米，萝卜、白菜地里套作小麦，春地瓜地里套作大麦、豌豆，以及小麦地里套作夏地瓜。其中，除了春地瓜地里套作大麦、豌豆，和小麦地里套作夏地瓜，今年还在试验阶段之外，其余三种，今年已经广泛推广。如小麦套作花生已有五万六千亩，小麦套作夏玉米已有四万三千亩，萝卜、白菜地套作小麦已有两万五千亩。实践证明，这些套作方法，收到以下三方面的显著效果：
    第一，可以扩大土地的复种面积，解决粮食和油料作物争地的矛盾，从而实现粮食和油料生产的全面跃进。文登县虽然是一个地少人多的地区，但土地的复种面积历来较少，直到1957年时，土地的复种指数只有137％强。这就使农业增产受到了很大的限制。这个县还是一个花生产地，按照国家计划要求，花生播种面积是必须切实保证的。但是，如果不扩大复种面积，就必然是保证了花生播种面积、就不能增加粮田面积，实现多种多收。实行上述农田套作的耕作方法，就有效地解决了这一问题。例如，小麦套作花生，就使本来一年只能一作的花生，种到了一年两作的地里，从而扩大了粮食或其他作物的播种面积。在萝卜、白菜地里套作小麦，也能使本来应该留作明年一年一作的春地，变成当年秋播、明年两收的土地，从而扩大了复种面积。今年该县推行套作的结果，与1959年比较，虽然由于基本建设占地，耕地面积减少了，但播种面积仍然增加了，复种指数也由142％提高到151％。
    第二，可以保证和提高夏播作物的产量。该县由于夏收作物收获晚和劳力不足等原因，夏播作物往往不易作到及时播种，影响产量甚大。夏玉米提前套作，就可以作到适时播种，提高收成。在麦收前提前套作夏花生，由于增加了夏花生的生长期，也可以提高产量。
    第三，可以调剂使用劳动力，在一定程度上解决农活集中期间的劳动力紧张问题。
    由于实行间种套作收到了上述显著效果，因而受到了广大干部和社员的拥护。最近，有公社党委第一书记参加的县委扩大会议上，在讨论秋播规划中，着重研究了明年更大规模推行套作和扩大秋播面积的问题，并根据套作的要求，规定了今年秋播中的各种间种套作的具体规划。这样，明年全县土地的播种面积和耕地复种指数，将比今年又有提高。实行农田套作，是耕作制度的革新，耕作的规格质量、各种措施也必须作相应的改革。县委在秋播规划中强调提出，必须根据实行套作的要求，在秋种前做好一切准备工作。首先要做好思想发动工作，进一步使干部、社员普遍认识套作的好处，从而自觉地积极地进行这一耕作制度的改革。其次，在措施方面，应当进一步大积大造肥料，以增加施肥量，适应复种面积扩大的要求。耕播工具的准备，也必须适应套作要求，把两腿宽幅密植耧、三腿宽幅密植耧、五腿密植耧和十行播种机准备齐全，配套成龙，作到用什么工具有什么工具，保证秋播和明年套作任务的完成。（附图片）
