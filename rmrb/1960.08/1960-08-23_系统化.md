　　Systematization

　　In the movement to increase production and practice economy, how to summarize, improve, and systematize those innovation projects that have a direct effect on solving the current production key problems, have the greatest effectiveness, and have universal significance, and then quickly and universally promote them, is a very important issue.

　　There are many successful precedents for systematization in various places. The implementation of continuous production in the Shanghai printing and dyeing industry, which increased daily output by 30% to 50% and labor productivity by two times, was the result of vigorously launching mass movements and vigorously promoting systematization. The realization of 230 single-machine automation units, 53 automatic production lines, and 134 production linkage lines by the Andong Construction Company is also the result of achieving systematization.

　　The systematization of innovation projects is one of the signs of the in-depth development of the movement to increase production and practice economy. A production unit, in order to ensure continuous leap forward in production, must continuously solve key problems in production through technological innovation; and from individual to overall, from low-level to high-level, systematize technological innovation, so that production can be fundamentally reformed. Therefore, grasping the key to production and consciously matching individual innovation projects into sets is an important measure to promote a leap forward in production.

　　In the mass movement to increase production and practice economy, technological innovation is bound to have great development, which creates conditions for moving towards systematization. Let us, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, continuously improve the degree of systematization according to specific circumstances, needs and possibilities, and continuously promote a leap forward in production.

    系统化
    在增产节约运动中，如何把那些对于解决当前生产关键有直接作用的、收效最大的和有普遍意义的革新项目，加以总结、提高，使之系统化，迅速普遍推广，这是一个十分重要的问题。
    系统化，各地有很多成功的先例。上海印染行业实行连续化生产，日产量提高30％到50％，劳动生产率提高两倍，就是大搞群众运动，大搞系统化的结果。安东建筑公司实现二百三十台单机自动化、五十三条自动生产线和一百三十四条生产联动线，这也是实现系统化的结果。
    革新项目系统化，是增产节约运动深入发展的标志之一。一个生产单位，要保证生产持续跃进，就要不断通过技术革新，解决生产上的关键问题；并由个别到全体，由低级到高级，使技术革新系统化，使生产得到根本的改革，所以，抓生产关键，有意识地把单项革新项目配起套来，是推动生产跃进的重要措施。
    群众性的增产节约运动里，技术革新必然有很大的发展，这就为走向系统化创造了条件，让我们在增产节约运动中根据具体情况，根据需要和可能，不断提高系统化的程度，不断促进生产跃进。
