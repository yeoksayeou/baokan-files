The US Revival of West German Militarism Threatens World Peace Wang Liang

Today is the fifteenth anniversary of the signing of the Potsdam Agreement. For fifteen years, the United States and other Western countries have been undermining the implementation of this agreement. The measures stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement to completely eradicate German militarism and lead Germany on the path of peace, democracy, and unity have only been earnestly implemented in the German Democratic Republic. In West Germany, however, the German militarist forces that launched two world wars have been revived with the support of the United States and other Western countries, and have restored their past economic and military strength. Now, the re-emerging West German militarists are not only raising the black swastika flag again throughout West German territory, but are also carrying out large-scale military expansion abroad, even engaging in blatant military collusion with Franco's Spain. Recently, West German Chancellor Adenauer visited the United States and Japan, intending to relive the old dream of the Nazi "Anti-Communist Axis." All this shows that West German militarist forces are following Hitler's old path. West Germany has once again become a hotbed of war threatening peace in Europe and the world.

The Economic Foundation of Militarism

The great revolutionary teacher Lenin taught us: In order to understand imperialism, we must connect imperialist policies with their economic foundation, and not, like the traitor of the proletarian revolution, Kautsky, "separate imperialist policies from its economy." Therefore, in studying the issue of West German militarism, we must also start from its economic foundation for examination.

Lenin pointed out: "The deepest economic foundation of imperialism is monopoly." Now let's take a look at what the "deepest economic foundation" of West German militarism is like today.

According to statistics, the degree of economic concentration in West Germany today has exceeded that of Hitler's Germany. In 1938, 19 large German monopoly organizations controlled nearly 50% of Germany's total stock capital, while today, 17 large monopoly organizations control 80% of West Germany's total stock capital.

In West Germany, 95% of electricity production, 94% of steel production, and 87% of coal production are currently concentrated in the hands of monopoly capital groups.

Two-thirds of West German chemical products today are still controlled by the Farben chemical concern. Currently, this group controls more than one-tenth of West Germany's total stock capital. The total capital of the three largest companies belonging to this group is equal to four times the capital of the Farben Group during Hitler's rule.

The Thyssen Group (formerly United Steel Company) currently controls 7.4% of West Germany's total stock capital and one-quarter of West Germany's steel production. This group has been economically supporting Nazi forces since 1923 and was also one of the main culprits of World War II.

Krupp, the famous "cannon king" of German militarism, is currently a giant in West Germany's coal, metallurgy, machinery manufacturing, and aircraft industries. He was a war criminal prematurely released by the American authorities in 1951. Now his power has also expanded compared to the past.

The three major banks of the Hitler era – "Deutsche Bank," "Dresdner Bank," and "Commerzbank" – have now been fully restored. Their capital and scope of business have also exceeded those before the war.

All this shows that the economic lifeline of West Germany is still in the hands of those who supported Hitler in launching aggressive wars in the past. And the power of these people has expanded even more than before.

The high concentration of economic power of West German monopoly capital took place during the post-war recovery of West Germany's economic power and its re-emergence as an industrial power in the capitalist world. Currently, West Germany's industrial production has reached 2.3 times the pre-war level of 1936. West Germany's industrial production has also surpassed Britain in the capitalist world and ranks second only to the United States. This situation has greatly strengthened the power of West German monopoly capital. The strengthening of West German monopoly capital inevitably leads it to invest in the struggle for world sales markets and raw material bases with even greater strength. Therefore, in recent years, the foreign expansion of West German monopoly capital has become increasingly intensified. After the end of World War II, this expansion began primarily in the economic field. In the economic field, it started first from the export of goods. In 1959, the total value of West Germany's annual exports increased from $2 billion in 1950 to nearly $10 billion, exceeding Britain and second only to the United States. In recent years, West Germany's capital exports have also been growing rapidly. From 1952 to June 1959, West Germany's total private direct foreign investment soared from 27 million marks to 2.4 billion marks. West German government capital exports at the end of 1958 were also 16 billion to 17 billion marks, greatly exceeding West Germany's private direct foreign investment. This fact shows that West Germany is concentrating on using state monopoly capital funds to carry out economic expansion abroad.

      Military Strength as Backup

The restoration of economic power has greatly increased the aggressive potential of German militarism, and the increase in aggressive potential requires greater outward expansion. To achieve all this requires not only greater economic strength but also military strength as backup. Therefore, while restoring economic strength, West German militarist forces have also tried their best to revive their military strength. It is in this situation that West German militarist forces, with the support and assistance of the United States, have vigorously carried out rearmament. After several years of activity, to this date, West Germany has re-established an army of nearly 270,000 men, which is being equipped with atomic and missile weapons. The core of this new "Bundeswehr" is former Nazi officers and former Hitler's SS troops. The Bonn government is stepping up its efforts to expand this "Bundeswehr" into a million-strong army.

It is worth noting that while West Germany is rebuilding its aggressive army and carrying out large-scale atomic armament, West German monopoly capital is also attempting to start up the machinery of military industry. Many monopoly groups such as Krupp, Farben Concern, Flick, etc., are actively preparing to manufacture various atomic weapons and missile weapons. This makes West Germany's rearmament even more dangerous.

The purpose of the West German Adenauer government in building such an army is to promote its dangerous revanchist and war policies. The starting point of this policy is that the status quo in Europe is "unacceptable." The West German government publicly announced its intention to annex the German Democratic Republic by force, does not recognize the Oder-Neisse line as the eastern border of Germany, and demands that Germany be mapped according to the "1937 borders of Germany." Adenauer recently clamored that East Prussia "has been German territory for more than seven hundred years" and "one day East Prussia will become free again."

But in reality, the expansionist ambitions of West German militarist forces far exceed the scope of the "1937 borders of Germany."

West German Defense Minister Strauss said in an article entitled "Basic Principles of German Policy" at the end of February that the five basic factors that determine West German policy include enabling the people of "Central and Eastern Europe" to "break away from communist rule," doing everything possible to promote "European integration," and that it is necessary to "ensure the security of the northern and southern flanks of Europe and the entire Mediterranean region and the Near East, and must find bases abroad," and so on. All this is exactly the same as Hitler's "living space" theory, which is to expand the territory of Germany as much as possible. Obviously, the West German government is following the aggressive policy of Hitler's "Mein Kampf," which states that "borders are man-made, and people can also change them." Now that West German militarists have regained the potential for foreign aggression, they are not only talking about it but also actively taking action. West Germany's recent request to establish its military supply bases in Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, and other countries is a manifestation of this.

The US is the Culprit

The Second World War ended only fifteen years ago, and West German militarism has surprisingly revived in Europe. How did this situation come about? Who is feeding this West German militarist wolf?

A simple review of post-war history will show that since the end of World War II, US imperialism has been deliberately tearing up the wartime allies' agreements on eliminating West German militarism and has consistently regarded dividing Germany and supporting West German militarist forces as the basis of its policy towards Europe. West German militarist forces have been revived under the comprehensive political, military, and economic support of the United States.

First, as soon as the war ended, the United States set about preventing Germany from being unified into one country. It tried its best to make the occupied areas of Western countries a divided country in fact economically and politically. The establishment of the Bonn regime in 1949 further fixed this divided situation.

The second step was for the United States to try its best to restore the vitality of West German militarism with economic "aid" and actively rearm West Germany, drawing West Germany into the North Atlantic war system controlled by the United States. The so-called "Paris Agreement" signed in May 1955 legalized West German rearmament. When all these legal procedures were completed, the United States began to openly and on a large scale help West Germany rearm. Especially when West Germany vigorously carried out atomic armament under the planning of the United States in 1958, the United States supplied a large number of atomic weapons and missile weapons to West Germany, making it an important atomic armed force in Western Europe. The West German authorities now have sixty-eight nuclear weapon launchers and forty-eight so-called "air defense rocket stations" that can also launch atomic weapons. The United States is now preparing to hand over "Polaris" nuclear missiles to West Germany.

The United States has been so enthusiastic about supporting West German militarism since World War II, and has stubbornly adhered to the policy of dividing Germany, drawing West Germany into the Western military bloc, preventing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and insisting on rearming West Germany for fifteen years, for its own purposes.

Former US Secretary of State and designer of current US foreign policy, Dulles, summarized the US policy towards Germany in his book "War or Peace" in 1950: "A revived Germany may also be a great asset to the Western countries. If the Western countries can attract East Germany to their side, they can get a forward strategic base in Central Europe, which will undermine the military and political position of the Soviet Communists in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other neighboring countries. So at a certain price, a revived, nationalist Germany has a lot to contribute to the Western countries."

US President Eisenhower, when he was the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group Army, once said in a report: "Because West Germany is located in the geographic center of Europe, it is of great strategic importance to the defense of the continent. With West Germany on our side, the troops of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can form a strong and complete defense line in Central Europe from the Baltic Sea to the Alps."

In the minds of the US ruling group, West Germany is also a very important source of cannon fodder. Regarding this issue, the "New York Times" wrote in October 1950: "It is particularly important to find a source of manpower reserves, and this reserve army can only come from Germany. The United States has the right to demand a dollar's worth of combat power for any dollar it pays." Former Republican Senate leader Taft said, "Using foreign soldiers to fight wars—even if we have to equip them—is always cheaper than using American children."

It can be seen that in the minds of the US ruling group, West Germany is first of all an ideal forward base for aggression against the socialist camp. The purpose of dividing Germany and drawing West Germany into the US war system is to turn West Germany into a bridgehead and hotbed of war for the United States in Western Europe, and to instigate West German militarists to continue the "eastward advance" mission that Hitler failed. The United States clearly wants to use the economic and political potential of West German militarism as an important force to realize its hegemony over the world.

The Economic Basis of US-German Collusion

In addition to political and military purposes, the US support for West German militarism also has its economic interests. The long-term collusion between US monopoly capital and West German monopoly capital is the basis for the alliance between the two countries.

US and German monopoly capital established close ties as early as the beginning of this century. After the First World War, US monopoly capital nurtured German monopoly capital with the golden rain of dollars through the infamous so-called "Dawes Plan" and "Young Plan." This is a well-known historical fact.

After the Second World War, according to incomplete statistics, from 1945 to 1955, the US government provided West Germany with US$3,578.9 million through the "Marshall Plan" and in the form of "aid."

US private direct investment in West Germany after the war also continued to increase. According to the US government, from 1950 to 1958, US direct private investment in West Germany increased from US$204 million to US$574 million. Currently, the amount of US private direct investment in West Germany ranks first among US private direct investment in various Western European countries.

The economic collusion between US monopoly capital and West German monopoly capital is becoming increasingly close, and this situation cannot but be reflected in US policy towards Germany. In this regard, it is enough to point out that several of the most powerful consortia in the United States that have a decisive influence on the policies of the US government today are also the consortia that have the closest ties with West German monopoly capital, foremost among them the Rockefeller consortium and the Morgan consortium, as well as the Mellon, DuPont, and California consortia. They have particularly close ties with West Germany's war-related industrial sectors, such as oil, electricity, atomic, aircraft, and automobile industries. US investment in West Germany is currently concentrated in these sectors.

After the end of World War II, the formulation and implementation of the US government's policy towards Germany has been tightly controlled by agents of monopoly groups that have close ties with West German monopoly capital. For example, former US High Commissioners to West Germany McCloy and Conant were representatives of the Rockefeller consortium, which has very close ties with West Germany's oil and electricity industries. Former US Ambassador to West Germany Bruce was a representative of the Mellon consortium, which has particularly close ties with West Germany's electricity industry. The current US Deputy Secretary of State Dillon is the former chairman of "Dillon-Reed Company (Bank)," which has particularly close ties with the German heavy industry and was one of the main participants in the "Dawes Plan," having provided large amounts of credit to the "United Steel Company" after the First World War. The company's deputy manager, Dreaper, served as the Minister of Economy of the US military government in Germany after the Second World War.

The policy of supporting West German militarism and rearming West Germany is bringing huge profits to US monopoly capital. For example, the Douglas Company, which belongs to the California consortium, is selling "Honest John" missiles and two types of "Nike" missiles to the West German army. Lockheed, of this same consortium, is providing "Star" aircraft to the West German Air Force. The Baltimore Martin Company, the Chrysler Company, and the General Dynamics Company, which are affiliated with the Rockefeller and Mellon groups, are also preparing to provide missiles to West Germany.

The above facts show that West German militarism has revived under the comprehensive support of US imperialism. Therefore, while opposing the revival of West German militarism, people must expose that US imperialism is the culprit for the revival of West German militarism, the number one enemy of the German people and the people of all countries in the world, and must resolutely oppose US imperialism's policy of persisting in dividing Germany, preventing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, supporting West German militarism, and intensifying arms expansion and war preparations.

        Times Have Changed

The intensified efforts of the US and West German governments to use the vicious forces of West German militarism to carry out foreign expansion and prepare for new wars show that the aggressive nature of US and West German imperialism has not changed in the slightest. They cannot see how much today's era has changed from the era after the First World War. At present, the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind. The unprecedentedly powerful and united socialist camp is an insurmountable obstacle to the launching of wars by US and West German militarism. On the other hand, the eastern part of Germany, which used to be part of the German militarism's base for aggression, has established the first workers' and peasants' state in German history, the German Democratic Republic. This has greatly weakened the power of West German militarism. All of this is a fatal blow to the forces of US and West German militarism. The Second World War launched by Hitler in the past could only end in the shameful defeat of Nazi Germany. If US and West German imperialism do not learn from historical lessons today and dare to act rashly, then their fate will not have any other way out except failure.

    美国复活西德军国主义威胁世界和平	王梁
    今天是波茨坦协定签订的十五周年。十五年来，美国和其他西方国家一直破坏这个协定的实施。波茨坦协定规定的彻底铲除德国军国主义，使德国走上和平、民主、统一的措施只有在德意志民主共和国得到了认真的贯彻。而在德国的西部，曾经发动了两次世界大战的德国军国主义势力，却又在美国和其他西方国家的扶植下复活起来，重新恢复了过去经济和军事力量。现在再度崛起的西德军国主义者不仅在整个西德领土上重新举起了黑色的卐字旗；而且正在国外大事进行军事扩张，甚至同佛朗哥西班牙进行明目张胆的军事勾结。不久前西德总理阿登纳访问美国和日本，打算重温纳粹的“反共轴心”的旧梦。这一切说明，西德军国主义势力正在走着希特勒的老路。西德已再一次变成了一个威胁欧洲和世界和平的战争策源地。
    军国主义的经济基础
    伟大的革命导师列宁教导我们：为了认识帝国主义，必须把帝国主义的政策同帝国主义的经济基础联系起来看，而不能像无产阶级革命底叛徒考茨基那样，“把帝国主义底政策和它的经济割开”。因此，在研究西德军国主义这一问题时，我们也必须首先从它的经济基础出发来考查。
    列宁指出：“帝国主义最深的经济基础，便是垄断”。现在来看一看西德军国主义这一“最深的经济基础”又是怎么样呢？
    根据统计资料，西德经济集中的程度今天已经超过了希特勒德国时代。1938年，德国十九家大垄断组织只控制了德国全部股票资本的将近50％，而今天，十七家大垄断组织就控制了西德全部股票资本的80％。
    在西德，95％的电力生产、94％的钢产量和87％的煤产量目前都集中在垄断资本集团手中。
    西德化学产品的三分之二今天仍然控制在法本化学康采恩手中。目前，这个集团控制着西德股票资本总额的十分之一以上。属于这个集团的三家最大的公司的资本总和就等于希特勒统治时期法本集团资本的四倍。
    蒂森集团（前联合钢铁公司）目前控制着西德股票资本总额的7.4％和西德钢产量的四分之一。这个集团从1923年起就在经济上支持纳粹势力，也是第二次世界大战的罪魁祸首之一。
    德国军国主义势力有名的“枪炮大王”克虏伯目前是西德的煤炭、冶金、机器制造和飞机工业巨头。他是在1951年被美国当局提前释放的战犯。现在他的势力也比过去扩大了。
    希特勒时代的三大银行——“德意志银行”、“德累斯顿银行”和“商业银行”现在已经完全恢复了。它们的资本和营业范围也都超过了战前。
    这一切表明，西德的经济命脉仍然是掌握在那些过去支持希特勒发动侵略战争的人的手中。而这些人的势力比过去更加扩大了。
    西德垄断资本经济势力的高度集中是在战后西德经济力量不断恢复和重新成为资本主义世界中一个工业强国的时候进行的。目前，西德的工业生产已经达到战前1936年水平的二点三倍。西德的工业生产在资本主义世界中也已经超过英国而居于第二位。这种情况使西德垄断资本的力量也大大加强。而西德垄断资本力量的加强又不可避免地使它以更加雄厚的实力投入争夺世界销售市场和原料基地的斗争。因此近几年来，西德垄断资本的对外扩张越来越加剧。在二次世界大战结束以后，这种扩张首先是从经济方面开始的。在经济方面首先又是从商品的出口方面开始的，1959年，西德全年出口的商品总值从1950年的二十亿美元增加到了将近一百亿美元，超过了英国，仅次于美国。近几年内西德的资本输出，也在迅速增长。从1952年到1959年6月，西德的私人直接对外投资总额已从二千七百万马克猛增到二十四亿马克。而西德政府的资本输出在1958年底也为一百六十亿至一百七十亿马克，大大超过西德的私人直接对外投资，这一事实表明，西德正在集中利用国家垄断资本的资金来向外实行经济扩张。
      军事实力作为后盾
    经济实力地位的恢复，大大增加了德国军国主义的侵略潜力，而侵略潜力的增加又要求向外进行更大的扩张。而要实现这一切就不仅需要经济上有更大的力量，同时也需要军事实力作为后盾。因此，西德军国主义势力在恢复经济实力的同时，它们也竭力重振军事实力地位。正是这种情况，西德军国主义势力又在美国的支持和帮助下，大力进行重新武装。经过几年来的活动，到最近为止，西德已经重新建立起了一支近二十七万人的、正在用原子和导弹武器装备起来的军队。这支新“国防军”的核心就是前纳粹军官和过去希特勒的党卫军。波恩政府正在加紧把这支“国防军”扩充成为百万人的大军。
    值得注意的，西德在重建侵略军和大规模进行原子武装的同时，西德的垄断资本也正在企图开动军事工业的机器。许多垄断集团如克虏伯、法本康采恩、弗利克等都正在积极准备制造各种原子武器和导弹武器。这使西德的重新武装更具有极大的危险性。
    西德阿登纳政府建立这样一支军队，其目的就是推行它那危险的复仇主义政策和战争政策。这个政策的出发点是：欧洲的现状“不能接受”。西德政府公开宣布打算武力吞并德意志民主共和国，不承认奥得—尼斯河为德国东部的疆界，而要求按照“1937年德国的疆界”来绘制德国的地图。阿登纳最近公然叫嚣东普鲁士“七百多年以来就是德国的领土”，“总有一天东普鲁士又会成为自由的”。
    但是，实际上，西德军国主义势力的扩张野心是远远超出“1937年德国的疆界”的范围的。
    西德国防部长施特劳斯2月底在一篇题为“德国政策的基本原则”的文章中就说过：决定西德政策的五个基本因素中就有使“中欧和东欧地区”的人民“脱离共产主义的统治”，尽一切方法来促进“欧洲一体化”，必须“保障欧洲北翼、南翼和全部地中海地区以及近东地区的安全，必须在国外寻找基地”等等。这一切同希特勒的“生存空间”理论一模一样，是要把德国的版图尽量扩大。显然，西德政府是遵循着希特勒的“我的奋斗”中提出的“疆界是人造的，人也可以去更改它”的侵略方针的。现在当西德军国主义者重新具有了对外侵略的潜力之后，它已经不仅仅在口头上，而且在积极行动起来了。最近西德向西班牙、法国、意大利、荷兰、比利时、挪威等国要求建立它的军事供应基地，就是这方面的表现。
    美国是罪魁
    第二次世界大战结束才不过十五年，西德军国主义竟然又在欧洲复活了，这种情况究竟是怎样造成的？是谁在喂养着西德军国主义这条狼呢？
    简单地回顾一下战后的历史，人们就会看到，自从第二次世界大战结束以来，美帝国主义就处心积虑地撕毁战时盟国关于肃清西德军国主义的历次协议，一直把分裂德国和扶植西德军国主义势力作为它对欧洲政策的基础。西德军国主义势力是在美国的政治的、军事的、经济的全面扶植下复活起来的。
    首先，美国在战争一结束就着手阻挠使德国统一成为一个国家，它竭力从经济上、政治上使得西方国家的占领区事实上成为一个分裂的国家。1949年建立波恩政权，更使这种分裂的局面固定下来了。
    第二步，美国就竭力用经济“援助”来恢复西德军国主义的元气，并且积极重新武装西德，把西德拉入在美国控制下的北大西洋战争体系。1955年5月订立的所谓“巴黎协定”使西德重新武装合法化。当这一切法律上的手续完成以后，美国就开始公开大规模地帮助西德重整军备。特别当1958年西德在美国策划下大力进行原子武装时，美国更把大量的原子武器和导弹武器供应西德，使它成为西欧一支重要的原子武装力量。西德当局现在已有六十八个核武器发射台，还有四十八个也可以发射原子武器的所谓“空防火箭站”。美国最近准备把“北极星”式核导弹交给西德。
    美国在二次大战以后如此热衷于扶植西德军国主义，并且十五年来一直顽固地坚持奉行分裂德国、把西德拉进西方军事集团、阻挠缔结对德和约和坚持重新武装西德的政策，是有它自己的打算的。
    美国前任国务卿、美国现行外交政策的制订者杜勒斯1950年，在他的著作“战争或和平”中曾经这样概括过美国的对德政策：“一个复兴的德国，也可能是西方国家的一笔很大的资产。西方国家如果能把东德吸引到它们一边，它们就能在中欧得到一个前进的战略基地，它将破坏苏联共产党在波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利和其他邻近国家的军事和政治地位。所以在一定的代价下，一个复兴的、民族主义的德国有很多东西可以贡献给西方国家。”
    美国现任总统艾森豪威尔在担任北大西洋集团军总司令的时候，曾经在一篇报告中这样说过：“由于西德处在欧洲的地理中心，它对于大陆的防御，在战略上有极大的重要性。有了西德在我们的一方，北大西洋公约组织的军队在中欧从波罗的海到阿尔卑斯山一线就可以形成一道强大完整的防线。”
    在美国统治集团心目中，西德也是一个十分重要的炮灰来源。关于这个问题，“纽约时报”在1950年10月曾写道：“特别重要的是寻找人力后备军的来源，而这种后备军又只能来自德国。美国有权对它所付出的任何一块美元要求值一块美元的战斗力。”美国前共和党参院领袖塔夫脱说，“利用外国士兵来进行战争——即使我们必须装备他们——总要比用美国孩子们来得便宜。”
    可见，在美国统治集团的心目中，西德首先是一个侵略社会主义阵营的理想的前进基地。分裂德国和把西德拉入美国的战争体系，其目的就是为了把西德变成美国在西欧大陆的桥头堡和战争策源地，嗾使西德军国主义者继续执行希特勒失败了的“东进”任务。美国显然想利用西德军国主义的经济和政治潜力作为实现它独霸世界的一支重要力量。
    美德勾结的经济基础
    美国扶植西德军国主义除了政治和军事目的之外，还有它的经济利益。美国垄断资本和西德垄断资本长期来的勾结就是两国结成联盟的基础。
    美国和德国的垄断资本早在本世纪初就建立了密切的联系。在第一次世界大战以后，美国垄断资本通过臭名远扬的所谓“道威斯计划”和“杨格计划”，用美元的金雨滋育了德国垄断资本，这是人所共知的史实。
    在第二次世界大战以后，据不完全统计，从1945年到1955年，美国政府通过“马歇尔计划”和以“援助”形式给西德的款项达到了三十五亿七千八百九十万美元。
    美国战后对西德的私人直接投资也不断增加。据美国政府宣布，从1950年到1958年，美国对西德的直接私人投资从二亿零四百万美元增加到了五亿七千四百万美元。目前，美国对西德的私人直接投资额在美国对西欧大陆各国的私人直接投资额中占第一位。
    美国垄断资本同西德垄断资本在经济上的勾结日益紧密，这种情况不能不反映到美国的对德政策上来。在这方面只要指出这一点就够了：今天对美国政府的政策有着决定性影响的几个美国最有势力的财团，也正是同西德垄断资本关系最密切的财团，其中首先是洛克菲勒财团和摩根财团，以及梅隆、杜邦和加利福尼亚财团等。它们同西德的同战争有关的工业部门联系特别密切，如石油、电气、原子、飞机和汽车工业等，美国对西德的投资目前也就集中在这几个部门中。
    第二次世界大战结束以后，美国政府的对德政策的拟定和执行一直紧紧地掌握在同西德垄断资本有着密切联系的垄断集团的代理人手中。例如：美国前任驻西德高级专员麦克洛埃和康南特都是洛克菲勒财团的代表，这个财团同西德的石油和电气工业的关系十分密切。美国前任驻西德大使布鲁斯是梅隆财团的代表，这个财团同西德电气工业的关系特别密切。美国的现任副国务卿狄龙是“狄龙—里德公司（银行）”的前董事长，这家公司同德国重工业的关系特别密切，是“道威斯计划”的主要参加者之一，曾在第一次世界大战后向“联合钢铁公司”提供过大笔信用贷款。这家公司的副经理德莱柏在二次大战结束后曾担任过驻德美国军政府的经济部长。
    扶植西德军国主义和重新武装西德的政策正在给美国垄断资本带来巨大的利润。例如：属于加利福尼亚财团的道格拉斯公司正在把“诚实的约翰”式导弹和两种“奈克”式导弹卖给西德军队。这一财团的洛克希德公司正在向西德空军提供“星”式飞机。准备向西德提供导弹的还有属于洛克菲勒和梅隆集团的巴尔的摩马丁公司、克莱斯勒公司以及同洛克菲勒和摩根集团有联系的通用动力公司等。
    以上事实说明，西德军国主义是在美帝国主义的全面扶植下复活起来的。因此，人们在反对西德军国主义复活的同时，必须揭露美帝国主义是复活西德军国主义的罪魁，是德国人民和世界各国人民的头号敌人，必须坚决反对美帝国主义坚持分裂德国，阻挠缔结对德和约和扶植西德军国主义、加紧扩军备战的政策。
        时代已经改变
    美国和西德政府这种加紧利用凶恶的西德军国主义势力来向外进行扩张和准备新战争，说明美国和西德帝国主义的侵略本性丝毫没有改变。它们看不到今天的时代和第一次大战后的时代有多么大的变化。目前东风已经压倒西风，空前强大的、团结一致的社会主义阵营就是美国和西德军国主义发动战争的一个不可克服的障碍。而另一方面，过去曾经是德国军国主义进行侵略基地的一部分的德国东部，已经建立起德国历史上第一个工农国家德意志民主共和国。这就大大削弱了西德军国主义的力量。这一切都是美国和西德军国主义势力的致命伤。过去希特勒发动的第二次世界大战只能以纳粹德国的可耻失败而告终，而今天如果美国和西德帝国主义还不吸取历史教训，胆敢轻举妄动，那么它们的命运除了失败之外是没有任何别的出路的。
