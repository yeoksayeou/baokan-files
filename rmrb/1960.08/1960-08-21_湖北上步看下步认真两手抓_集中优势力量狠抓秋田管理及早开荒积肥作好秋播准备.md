　　Wuhan, This newspaper, August 20th. Hubei province is adhering to the spirit of “looking ahead from the present step, looking to next year from this year,” earnestly persisting in the working method of "grasping both tasks." On the one hand, they are concentrating superior forces to vigorously combat drought and waterlogging, weed and apply fertilizer, and prevent and control pests and diseases, striving for an all-round bumper harvest in the autumn. On the other hand, they are taking advantage of the current slack season for draft cattle to organize a certain amount of labor and animal power to vigorously carry out autumn planting preparations centered on land reclamation and fertilizer accumulation, creating conditions for winning a bumper summer harvest next year.

　　At present, the growth of all types of crops in the province is generally good. More than three million mu of new wasteland has been reclaimed, and the reform, manufacturing, and promotion of autumn plowing and planting tools are also being stepped up. The Xiangyang Special District alone has repaired and newly manufactured 420,000 various tools in the past month. In order to prepare sufficient topdressing and base fertilizer for autumn and summer fields, tens of thousands of people in Huanggang, Xiangyang, Yidu, and other areas go to the mountains and lakes every day to accumulate green manure. In light of the characteristics of this year’s expanded autumn planting area and the increased requirements for sowing quality, all localities have carefully selected and reserved sufficient seeds of various varieties, and managed and stored them separately. After consultation between various regions, surpluses and shortages of various varieties have been adjusted.

　　Hubei has a mild climate, even rainfall, fertile soil, and a very short freezing period. According to past experience, there are fewer natural disasters during the growth period of summer crops, and the yield has always been relatively stable. Some areas, such as Xiangyang Special District, leaders at all levels and commune members have fully recognized these characteristics of summer crops. In recent years, while grasping the production of rice and miscellaneous grains, they have prominently grasped summer crops. In 1952, the autumn planting area in the district was only seven million mu. This year it has expanded to twelve million mu. The area of paddy fields in the district has also expanded from the original three million mu to six million mu. In just a few years, this low-yielding area, famous throughout the province, has rapidly changed its production outlook.

　　As early as during the summer harvest, Hubei widely mobilized the masses from top to bottom to summarize the abundant harvests of previous years, especially this year’s summer harvest. Then, various meetings were held continuously to study and formulate plans for the next year’s summer crop planting area, seed quantity, base fertilizer quantity, tools, etc. Many areas have also implemented these plans at the production team level. This practice of arranging autumn plowing and planting work early allows the communes and production teams to have ample time for deliberation and preparation, such as land reclamation, seeds, fertilizers, tools, labor arrangements, and technical training. All localities have made careful plans for various crops this year and next year, and have made arrangements for crop rotations. For example, early-maturing barley, rapeseed, green manure, and winter vegetables are planted in early rice fields; the wheat-cotton rotation is implemented in cotton fields, with wheat and barley sown in wide rows, and cotton is intercropped in the wide rows in the following spring; wheat in paddy fields is also prepared for timely early sowing to advance the maturity period. By arranging the rotation of the previous and next season crops well, it is possible to expand the autumn planting area and stagger the busy periods, so as to better arrange labor.

　　Vigorously reclaiming land to expand the autumn planting area is a strategic measure for Hubei Province to accelerate the development of agriculture. On the one hand, all localities are investing most of their labor in current field production to promote the upgrading of seedlings and strive for a bumper autumn harvest; on the other hand, they are organizing appropriate labor to seize the current good opportunity and launch a large-scale campaign to reclaim wasteland. According to past experience, Xiangyang Special District has made a comprehensive plan for the quantity, quality, and time requirements of this year’s land reclamation. Zhaoyang County in this special district has adopted a method of combining large areas first with small areas, planning 32 land reclamation bases, fixing 16,000 laborers and 12,000 pairs of draft cattle, reclaiming land early and late, and grazing at ordinary times. In just over a month, 300,000 mu of land has been reclaimed, and most of it has been plowed and harrowed immediately after reclamation. At the same time, according to the new situation of the expanded autumn planting area this year, all localities have adopted a method of combining fixed special teams with temporary shock attacks to vigorously accumulate and manufacture fertilizer, preparing base fertilizer for autumn-sown wheat, barley, and beans.

### 湖北上步看下步认真两手抓  集中优势力量狠抓秋田管理及早开荒积肥作好秋播准备

    湖北上步看下步认真两手抓
    集中优势力量狠抓秋田管理及早开荒积肥作好秋播准备
    本报武汉20日电　湖北各地本着“上步看下步，今年看明年”的精神，认真坚持“两手抓”的工作方法，一方面集中优势力量狠抓防旱防涝、除草追肥、防治病虫害，力争秋季全面丰收；一方面利用当前耕牛伏闲季节，组织一定的劳力和畜力，大力开展以开荒、积肥为主要内容的秋种准备工作，为夺取明年夏季丰收创造条件。
    目前，全省各类作物生长一般良好，新开荒地已达三百多万亩，秋耕秋种工具的改革、制造、推广工作也在加紧进行。仅襄阳专区最近一个多月就已整修、新制各种工具四十二万多件。为了给秋田和夏田备足追肥和基肥，黄冈、襄阳、宜都等地区每天都有几十万人，上山下湖，大积青肥。各地还根据今年秋种面积扩大、播种质量要求提高的特点，对各种种子大都选好留足、专藏专管，各地区之间经过协商，对各种品种进行了余缺调剂。
    湖北气候温和，雨水匀调，土质肥沃，封冻时间很短。根据历年经验，夏收作物生长期间，自然灾害较少，产量一向比较稳定。一些地区，如襄阳专区，各级领导和社员充分认识到夏收作物的这些特点，近几年来，在抓水稻、杂粮生产的同时，突出地抓住了夏收作物。全区在1952年秋种面积只有七百万亩，今年便扩大到一千二百万亩，全区水田面积也由原来的三百万亩扩大到六百万亩。几年间，这个闻名全省的低产地区，迅速改变了生产面貌。
    早在夏收期间，湖北各地就自上而下地广泛地发动群众，对历年特别是今年夏季丰产进行总结，接着，又连续召开各种会议，研究和制定了明年夏收作物播种面积、种子量、基肥量、工具等方面的规划，许多地区并已层层落实到生产队。这种提早安排秋耕秋种工作的作法，就使各公社、生产队有比较充裕的时间进行酝酿和准备，如开荒、种子、肥料、工具、安排劳动力、训练技术力量等。各地都及早对今年和明年的各种作物进行了周密计划，做好茬口安排。如在早稻田里，种早熟的大麦、油菜和绿肥、冬菜；棉田实行麦棉两熟，小麦、大麦用宽行条播法，次年春季再在宽行里套种棉花；水稻田种小麦也准备适时早播，提早成熟期。这样把上季与下季作物的轮作换茬安排好，既能扩大秋种面积，又可以错开活路，更好地安排劳动力。
    大力开荒扩大秋种面积，是湖北省当前加速发展农业的具有战略性的措施。各地一方面以大部分劳力投入当前田间生产，促进禾苗升级，力夺秋季丰收；一方面组织适当劳力，抓紧当前大好时机，向荒地大进军。襄阳专区根据往年经验，把今年开荒的数量、质量、时间要求，进行了全面规划。这个专区的枣阳县采取先大片后小片、大片小片相结合的办法，规划出三十二个开荒基地，固定一万六千名劳动力，一万二千犋耕牛，一早一晚开荒，平时放牧，只一个多月时间，就已开荒地三十万亩，大部分作到了随开随犁随耙。和这同时，各地还根据今年秋种面积扩大的新情况，采取固定专班与临时突击相结合的方法，大搞积肥造肥，为秋种的小麦、大麦和豆类准备基肥。
