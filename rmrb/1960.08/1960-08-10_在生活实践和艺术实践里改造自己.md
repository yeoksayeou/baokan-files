    Imperialist spokesmen and bourgeois artists despise socialist society and hate the direction of our Party's literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, nonsensically claiming that literary and art workers going deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers and transforming their worldview through labor is a "waste of artistic talent." I want to refute this malicious slander.

    I have performed in operas for more than ten years in the old society, and I have continued to perform in the new society. As for who is wasting talent, it is as clear as drinking cold water in winter, felt point by point in my heart. I started learning opera at a young age. At the age of seventeen, I performed in Shanghai for the first time, and the business was average. The boss frowned and suddenly came up with an idea: to have me sing "Spinning Cotton." I didn't know how at all, so I learned it on the spot, forced to piece together a bit here and a bit there, and called it "Spinning Cotton." The boss publicized this extensively, and later I was branded with the title of "Spinning King." Of course, in the old society, my own ideological understanding was also very vague. Sometimes I wanted to perform some old plays with substance, but the repertoire was in the hands of the boss, and he wouldn't listen to you. As time went on, my art gradually declined. Because I couldn't see a future, I didn't practice my skills, didn't train my voice, forgot the old plays, and couldn't even run the stage properly. All day long, I was just muddling along, not understanding what life was for. In the old society, many actors were wasted away like this.

    In the new society, our opera actors have not only been politically liberated, but also artistically revived. Female actors in their thirties were kicked off the stage by the boss in the old society; but now my artistic life seems to have just begun. Like many of my contemporary actors, I only realized the meaning of acting after liberation, and therefore, I can engage in drama work with greater political enthusiasm.

    In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, we have often gone to the countryside and factories to participate in labor, and have also been in constant contact with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. But at the beginning, my understanding of the purpose and significance of going deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers was very superficial. I thought that giving a performance or singing a section for the workers, peasants, and soldiers was a good way to serve them. When I arrived at my destination, I sat coldly on the side. If people didn't come to talk to me, I wouldn't chat with them; as for labor, it was often based on the task. I would operate a machine or work in the wheat field for an hour or two, and the enthusiastic workers and peasants would immediately repeatedly advise me to rest well, and that was it. I completely did not understand the great significance of going deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, transforming my worldview through labor, and making myself worker-peasant-ized.

    Under the Party's constant education, my thoughts and feelings could not help but gradually change, and the noble qualities of the workers, peasants, and soldiers could not help but educate me in every specific event. It was several years ago that I and many comrades from the theater went to a construction site to offer condolences and perform. It suddenly started to rain heavily, and it rained harder and harder. I thought the audience would disperse today, and the play wouldn't be performed; but it wasn't so. Despite the heavy rain, thousands of migrant workers and road-building soldiers still sat upright in the open-air square, braving the rain, motionless, and watching our play with rapt attention. A warm current surged from my heart to my face. I understood that it was not our art that grabbed them, but the affection of our relatives that moved them. My comrades and I from the theater took out our own raincoats and draped them over the migrant workers and soldiers. We knew that a few raincoats could not cover the bodies of thousands of workers and soldiers, but being able to protect a few was what we should do. At that time, the enthusiasm of the stage and the audience intertwined, forming an unusually moving scene. Such things are often encountered in our performance activities. Gradually, I developed a deep affection for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. No matter if I went to factories, the countryside, or the troops, I was no longer as out of place as I was at the beginning.

    This spring, when I went with the Shanghai Municipal Delegation to Condole with Representatives of Workers Participating in Northwest Construction to offer condolences and perform in many places in the Northwest, I received even greater education. As soon as we arrived in Qinghai, we rushed to the Qaidam Basin, more than 3,000 meters above sea level, to offer condolences and perform. We sat in the car for three whole days. All we saw along the way were countless cattle and sheep, but we couldn't see a single household. Only two or three road construction workers were holding on to this desolate Gobi Desert, building roads to ensure the smooth flow of the Northwest artery of the motherland. I thought, what are these ordinary laborers doing, coming and going in the wind and rain 365 days a year, living in this desolate and cold area? Their dedication to the cause of socialist construction deeply moved and educated me. I further understood what selfless labor and noble qualities are called.

    Because the terrain of Qaidam is too high and the air pressure is very low, people who have just arrived here always feel difficulty breathing. But we still have to sing operas here. I couldn't help but mutter in my heart. Later, when I came into contact with the heroic workers participating in urban construction and learned how they had brought into play their revolutionary drive, overcoming serious difficulties, brick by brick, thread by thread, building countless factories and high-rise buildings from scratch in this cold, barren land, my confidence and courage greatly increased. I also saw that the comrades of the Beijing Opera Troupe from Shanghai, in difficult conditions, were performing with vigor. If they could do it, why couldn't we? Being encouraged by them gave me great strength. We also mustered our energy, not only to sing, but to sing especially well. I wanted to express my high respect to these construction heroes, most of whom came from Shanghai and other inland areas. We were offering condolences to them, but in fact, they were educating us.

    As an actor, I have always been taken care of by the organization in life, but the "delicacy" brought from the old society could not correctly treat this care. Since the Great Leap Forward, I have increasingly felt that it was inappropriate, and I have increasingly felt that this delicacy was hindering my approach to the masses. The Party helped me and told me how to overcome the delicacy of individualism. With the help of the Party, I tried my best to live with all the comrades, share weal and woe, and work together during the tour. When I went to the Northwest this year to offer condolences and perform, the maximum stay in one place was no more than three days, and sometimes I changed several places a day. But seeing the spirit of the heroes building the Northwest who were working selflessly, seeing how much they needed cultural life and how much they liked and respected our country's opera art, my delicacy was washed away by their heroism, and my body and spirit became even better.

    Because of constantly going deep into life, contacting the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and being infected and influenced by their noble ideological qualities, the individualistic things in me gradually decreased. My mind broadened, my mood became cheerful, and the kind of mood in which I worried about gains and losses, and felt annoyed for half a day when encountering a trivial matter, was almost completely shaken off. Looking back on the past—it was only a few years ago—it was really very funny. Because of the influence of the old society, I developed a bourgeois bad style, and even felt embarrassed to get a basin of water to wash my face. Later, I had a certain awareness and wanted to overcome that bad style. When I went on tour with my comrades, I saw that they were very busy, so I helped to fold the costumes and dismantle the stage when unloading; but the comrades still seemed to think that I had the airs of a star and did not get close to me. I was also very depressed, why couldn't I get along with everyone. After constantly going deep into life, I deeply realized that for us literary and art workers from the old society, it is a matter of complete change—a matter of transforming the worldview, changing thoughts and feelings, and changing lifestyles. In fact, it is a matter of improving one's ideological level and moral character. Now when we go out to perform, all the comrades in the group are of one mind, everyone is united, loving, helping each other, and making progress together. It is really indescribably warm. I also deeply realized that the more a person pursues so-called "personal happiness," the more personal distress he will feel, because desires are endless, and the more personal pursuits you have, the less you can satisfy them; and only by completely disregarding personal gains and losses and subordinating personal interests to collective interests can you truly feel what happiness is. One will be even closer to the Party.

    My new artistic life also comes from another aspect, that is, through expressing modern life and shaping the artistic images of revolutionary heroes on the stage, I have been politically and artistically improved at the same time. Since the Great Leap Forward, opera has been expressing modern life as a new fashion. People perform it, and I perform it too, never falling behind, but I don't understand what it means.

    But when the materials for "Zhao Yiman" were in hand, and I repeatedly studied the creative outline with the director, I unconsciously gradually immersed myself in the heroic epic of this great revolutionary martyr. I thought about many, many questions. She was so strong, overcoming the enemy's various tortures, overcoming the threat of death, as long as there was a breath left, she insisted on fighting unyieldingly, until she gave her life. What was she doing it for? Where did her strength come from? I vaguely found the answer: she was for the noble cause of human liberation, she was for the realization of revolutionary ideals; because she had firm revolutionary ideals, she could confidently and bravely move forward and sing loudly. I am determined to learn from her. I am determined to perfectly establish this respectable figure on the stage. However, I was not familiar with such revolutionary heroes, so the Party helped me to find images that could be used as a reference everywhere and to learn from experience everywhere. I began to understand that if I did not have the communist ideological consciousness and the communist spiritual character, I would definitely not be able to play the role of a hero well. At that time, I was not yet a Party member, and artistic creation itself urgently demanded that I rapidly improve my ideological awareness. That is to say, the heroic figure I played was relentlessly "forcing" me, urging me to strengthen my close ties with the workers and peasants. In the process of artistic creation, I felt that, because I had been constantly going deep into life, contacting the workers, peasants, and soldiers, my thoughts and feelings were gradually changing, so I could have some superficial understanding of the thoughts and behaviors of the heroic figures, know what they loved and what they hated, and then, with the guidance and help of the Party, I could initially answer why she (Zhao Yiman) would make such heroic behaviors, and also be able to express her relatively accurately on the stage.

    When the play "Zhao Yiman" was performed in the Northeast, there were often audience members who came to see us backstage after the play was over. Someone hugged me and cried because her friend had also died in prison. In Harbin, one day after the performance, my comrades said to me: Come and see quickly, an old man who had once sheltered Zhao Yiman cried straight after watching the play and refused to leave. I didn't bother to take off my makeup and rushed to him. When he saw me, his eyes filled with tears, he took my hand, unable to speak, painfully remembering his comrades. I realized that he regarded me as the real Zhao Yiman, and I was also very excited to hug him and shout "Old Father." At this time, I further understood the significance of playing the role of a hero, it educated both the audience and myself. This also strengthened my request to join the Party.

    From the performance of "Spinning Cotton" in the past to the performance of "Zhao Yiman" in recent years, for me, it is such a sharp contrast. I deeply realized how great the significance of performing good plays—shaping the artistic image of heroic figures—is; what kind of negative impact performing bad plays—promoting pornography and boring things—will have on the masses.

    The enemies of the proletariat slander our Party's direction of literature and art as "wasting artistic talent," and criticize our literary and art works as having only political content, being dry and devoid of artistry; my growth process and personal experience are the most powerful refutation of their fallacies. I want to solemnly tell them that it is precisely because the subject matter of "Zhao Yiman" has a high degree of ideology that it has prompted me to try my best to improve my political ideology, and because of the improvement of ideological awareness, I have achieved certain achievements in artistic creation. If my ideological awareness is not improved, if I do not work hard on and off stage to shape the image of contemporary heroic figures, but always perform those old plays, even if I put aside "Spinning Cotton," if I keep performing "Hongniang" for a lifetime, what artistic creation will there be?

    From the above two aspects of comparison based on my personal experience—first, the old society cruelly wasted actors, while the new society enabled actors to regain their artistic lives; second, going deep into life, closely combining with the working people, artistic creation will be achieved, while deviating from the masses and imitating rigidly can only take the path of formalism—I deeply realized, and also firmly recognized, that the environment in which literary and art workers in our country are located is the best and happiest environment, and our society provides the broadest path and environment for the prosperity and development of literary and art undertakings. Because Chairman Mao pointed out the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the socialist cause, and the path of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, and a hundred schools of thought contend" and "bringing forth the new through the old" under this direction. All our literary and art workers must resolutely move forward in this direction. And if we want to implement this direction, if we want to defend this direction, we must resolutely stand at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and against modern revisionism! We must firmly and forever listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow the Communist Party!

    在生活实践和艺术实践里改造自己	童芷苓
    帝国主义的代言人、资产阶级文艺家仇视社会主义社会，仇恨我们党的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，胡说什么文艺工作者深入工农兵、通过劳动锻炼改造世界观，是“糟蹋艺术人材”，我要对这种恶毒的诽谤进行驳斥。
    我在旧社会里演过十几年戏，在新社会里也一直在演戏。究竟是谁糟蹋人材，在我的心里，真是冬天喝凉水，点点在心头，看得明明亮亮，再清楚不过的了。我从小学戏，十七岁那年，第一次到上海演出，营业很平常。老板眉头一皱，忽然想出一个主意，叫我唱《纺棉花》。我根本不会，就临时现学，逼着我东学一段西学一段凑在一起，就算一出《纺棉花》了。老板就此大肆宣传，后来我就被挂上了“劈纺大王”的招牌。当然，在旧社会里，我自己的思想认识也是很模糊的，有时也很想演点有骨子的老戏，可是戏码抓在老板手里，不能听你的。日子一久，艺术就渐渐走下坡路了。由于看不到前途，功也不练了，嗓子也不吊了，老戏也忘了，甚至圆场都跑不好了。整天就是瞎混，根本不懂人生在世到底是为了什么。在旧社会里，好多演员就是这样活活被糟蹋了的。
    在新社会里，我们戏曲演员不仅政治上翻了身，艺术上也起死回生了。三十几岁的女演员，在旧社会里早就被老板赶出舞台了；可是现在我的艺术生命却好像刚刚开始。我和许多同辈的演员同志一样，只是在解放之后，才越来越认识到演戏的意义，因而，也能用更大的政治热情来从事戏剧工作。
    近几年来，特别是大跃进以来，我们常常下乡、下厂参加劳动，也不断和工农兵群众接触。可是一开始的时候我对深入工农兵的目的和意义理解很肤浅，以为送上门去给工人、农民、战士唱一出或唱一段就是很好地为工农兵服务了。到了目的地，冷清清地坐在一边，人家不来找我说话，我也不和人家攀谈；至于劳动，往往也是从任务出发的，在机床上或者麦地里操作一两小时，热情的工人、农民马上就再三地来劝阻我，要我好好休息，就算完了。完全不懂深入工农兵，通过劳动锻炼，改造世界观，使自己工农化的重大意义。
    在党不断地教育下，我的思想感情就不由得不逐渐起变化，工农兵的高贵品质就不得不在每一个具体事件上对我起到教育的作用。那是好几年前的事了，我和剧院的许多同志到一个工地去慰问演唱。天忽然下起大雨来，并且越下越大，我想今天观众要散了，戏唱不成了；可是不然，尽管雨越下越大，几千个民工和筑路的战士仍然端坐在露天广场上，冒着大雨，纹丝不动，全神贯注地看我们的戏。一股暖流从我的心窝一直涌到脸上。我懂得并不是我们的艺术抓住了他们，而是我们带来的亲人的情谊打动了他们，我和剧院的同志们都拿出我们自己的雨衣，披在民工和战士的身上，我们知道几件雨衣遮盖不了几千个工人和战士的身体，但能够遮护几个人，也是我们应该做的。那时候台上台下热情交织，汇成了一幅异常动人的场面。像这样的事情在我们的演出活动中是经常遇到的。逐渐，我对工农兵发生了深厚的感情，无论下厂、下乡、下部队，再也不像开始那样格格不入了。
    今年春天，我随上海市慰问参加西北建设职工代表团，到西北许多地方去慰问演出，所受的教育就更大了。一到青海，我们就奔赴海拔三千多米的柴达木盆地去慰问演出。坐在汽车上整整走三天，一路上只看见数不尽的牛羊，却看不到一户人家，只有三三两两修路的工人坚守在这杳无人烟的戈壁滩上，正在修筑公路，保障祖国西北大动脉的畅通。我就想，这些平凡的劳动者，一年三百六十五天风里来雨里去，生活在这荒凉而严寒的地带，他们究竟为了什么呢？他们为社会主义建设事业的献身精神深深感动和教育了我，我进一步懂得了什么叫作忘我的劳动和崇高的品质了。
    柴达木由于地势过高，气压很低，刚到这里的人总感到呼吸困难。可是我们还要在这里整出地唱戏呢。我心里不由地嘀咕起来。后来和参加城市建设的英雄的工人一接触，知道他们是怎样发挥了革命的干劲，克服了严重的困难，一砖一木，一丝一缕，在这严寒的不毛之地，平地盖起无数座工厂和高楼来，我的信心和勇气就大大增加了。我又看到由上海来的支援柴达木的京剧团的同志们，在艰苦的条件下，他们精神抖擞地演戏。他们行，我们为什么不行呢？受到他们的鼓舞，给了我很大的力量，我们也鼓足了干劲，不但要唱，而且要唱得特别好，我要向这些大都来自上海和其他内地的建设英雄们表示我的崇高敬意。我们在慰问他们，实际上是他们在教育我们。
    作为一个演员，在生活上一向总是受到组织照顾的，可是从旧社会带来的“娇气”，就不能正确地对待这种照顾。大跃进以后，我越来越觉得不合适，越来越觉得这种娇气阻碍了自己同群众的接近。党帮助我，告诉我应该怎样克服个人主义的娇气。在党的帮助下，我在巡回演出中就尽自己的可能和全体同志一起生活，共甘苦，同劳动。今年去西北慰问演出的时候，在一个地点最多停留不超过三天，有时还一天换几个地方，可是看到建设大西北的英雄们忘我劳动的精神，看到他们是那样需要文化生活，那样喜欢和尊重我们祖国的戏曲艺术，我的娇气也给他们的英雄气概冲掉了，身体和精神反而更好了。
    就由于不断深入生活，和工农兵接触，受到他们崇高的思想品质的感染和影响，我身上的个人主义的东西也逐渐减少了，我的胸襟开阔了，心情愉快了，那种患得患失、碰到一点鸡毛蒜皮的事想不开就烦恼大半天的心情差不多完全摆脱了。回想过去——不过是几年以前的事，真是非常好笑。因为旧社会的影响，养成一种资产阶级的坏作风，连自己打盆洗脸水都觉得难为情。后来，自己有了一定的觉悟，想克服那种坏作风，和同志们一道出外巡回演出时，看到同志们很忙，也帮着叠服装，卸台时折大幕；可是同志们好像还觉得我有角儿架子，不大和我接近；我也很苦闷，怎么老和大家搞不好。经过不断深入生活，我深刻地体会到：对我们来自旧社会的文艺工作者说来，是彻底改变的问题——改造世界观、改变思想感情、改变生活方式的问题。实际上是提高自己的思想水平、道德品质的问题。现在我们出门演出，全团同志们打成一片，大家团结友爱，互相帮助，共同进步，真是说不出的温暖。我也深切体会到：一个人越是追求所谓“个人幸福”，他越会感到个人苦恼，因为欲望是无止境的，你的个人追求愈多，就愈不能满足；而完全不计较个人得失，把个人利益服从集体利益才会真正感到什么叫做幸福。对党才会更加亲近。
    我的艺术上的新生命还来自另一个方面，那就是通过表现现代生活、在舞台上塑造革命英雄人物的艺术形象，使自己在政治上、艺术上同时得到了提高。大跃进以来，戏曲表现现代生活是新的风尚，人家演我也演，决不落后，可是并不懂得有什么意义。
    但是当《赵一曼》的材料拿到手里，和编导一起反复研究创作提纲的时候，我不知不觉逐渐沉浸到这伟大革命烈士的英雄史诗里面去了。我想到许多许多的问题。她这么坚强，战胜敌人的各种酷刑，战胜死亡的威胁，只要还有一口气，就坚持不屈地斗争，直到献出自己的生命为止。她究竟是为了什么？她的力量究竟是从哪里来的？我朦胧地找到了答案：她是为了崇高的人类解放事业，她是为了革命理想的实现；由于她具有坚定不移的革命理想，她才能满怀信心地、勇往直前地高歌迈进。我决心要向她学习。我决心要把这个可尊敬的人物在舞台上完美地树立起来。但是，我很不熟悉这类革命英雄，党就帮助我到处找寻可以借鉴的形象，到处取经。我开始懂得如果自己没有共产主义的思想觉悟和共产主义的精神品德，是一定演不好英雄人物的。那时候我还不是党员，艺术创造本身迫切地向我提出迅速提高自己思想觉悟的要求。也就是说，我所扮演的英雄人物毫不容情地在“逼”我，在督促我加强和工农劳动人民的亲密联系。在艺术创造的过程中，我感到，由于几年来不断深入生活，和工农兵群众接触，自己的思想感情逐渐在起变化，因而才能对英雄人物的思想行为有些粗浅的理解，知道他们爱什么憎什么，再经过党的指导和帮助，才能初步地回答她（赵一曼）为什么会做出这样的英雄行为，也才能比较准确地把她体现在舞台上。
    《赵一曼》这个戏，在东北一带演出，常常有观众散了戏到后台来看我们。有人抱住我哭起来，因为她的朋友也是在监狱里牺牲的。在哈尔滨，有一天散场后，同志们跟我说：你快来看看吧，有一位曾经掩护赵一曼的老伯伯看完戏，直哭，不肯走。我顾不得卸装，赶快跑到他面前，他看见我，眼里含着泪，拉着我的手，说不出话来，沉痛地怀念着他的战友。我体会到，他把我当作了真的赵一曼了，我也非常激动地抱着他，直喊“老爸爸”。这时我才进一步懂得了演英雄人物的意义，他既教育了观众，也教育了我自己。这也就更加强了我入党的要求。
    从过去《劈纺》的演出，到近年来《赵一曼》的演出，在我来说，是多么尖锐的一个对照。我深深体会到：演好戏——塑造英雄人物的艺术形象，具有多么大的意义；演坏戏——宣扬黄色和无聊的东西，会对群众发生什么样的不良影响。
    无产阶级的敌人却诬蔑我们党的文艺方向是“糟蹋艺术人材”，指摘我们的文艺作品只有政治性，内容干巴巴的，没有艺术性；我的成长过程和切身经历就是对他们的谰言的最有力的驳斥。我要严正地告诉他们：正因为《赵一曼》这个题材具有高度的思想性，才促使我不得不极力提高自己的政治思想，而由于思想觉悟的提高，我在艺术创造上才取得了一定的成绩。如果我思想觉悟不提高，不在舞台上下功夫塑造当代的英雄人物的形象，而始终演那几出老戏，即使抛开《劈纺》不谈，一辈子老把《红娘》演下去，在艺术上又会有些什么创造呢？
    从以上我亲身经历的两方面的对比来看——第一，旧社会残酷地糟蹋演员，新社会使演员重获艺术生命；第二，深入生活，和劳动人民密切结合，艺术上就会有所创造，脱离群众，刻板地模仿，就只能走形式主义的道路——我深深地体会到，也是坚定不移地认识到：我们国家的文艺工作者所处的环境，是一个最好、最幸福的环境，我们的社会为文艺事业的繁荣和发展提供了最广阔的道路和环境。因为毛主席给我们指出了文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务的方向和这个方向下的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”和“推陈出新”的道路。我们全体文艺工作者一定要坚决地朝着这个方向前进。而我们要贯彻这个方向，要保卫这个方向，我们就得坚决地站到反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的斗争的最前列来！就得坚定地永远地听毛主席的话，跟共产党走！
