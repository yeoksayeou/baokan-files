Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 18th: The Korean National "Chollima Workteam" Movement Advanced Workers' Conference grandly opened in Pyongyang today. Over two thousand "Chollima Workteam" leaders and grassroots trade union cadres are participating in this conference.

    Korean Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, Choi Yong-kun, and other party and state leaders attended today's conference.

    The issues to be discussed at this three-day conference are the comprehensive launching of the technical innovation movement in all sectors of the national economy and the expansion and development of the "Chollima Workteam" movement. Li Hyo-sun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, delivered a report on this issue at the meeting this morning.

    In his report, Li Hyo-sun pointed out that the "Chollima Workteam" movement, based on promoting the high level of enthusiasm and creativity of the working people, has become a powerful driving force for promoting socialist construction in Korea today. Since the members of Chen Yingyuan's "Chollima Workteam" at the Jiangxian Steel Plant initiated this movement, it has developed into a powerful mass movement involving more than 178,000 working people in one year and five months. Among the more than 8,600 workteams participating in this movement, 766 have won the title of "Chollima Workteam," and 13 workteams have won the double "Chollima Workteam" title. Today, not only workers from factories are participating in this movement, but also employees from all economic and cultural sectors such as education, culture, healthcare, art, and commerce, as well as workteams from 207 agricultural cooperatives.

    Li Hyo-sun then spoke about the characteristics of the "Chollima Workteam" movement. He said that the first important characteristic is that the people participating in the movement have promoted a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, and have leaped to improve labor productivity through collective technical innovation. Another characteristic of the "Chollima Workteam" movement is that the participants in the movement have demonstrated their infinite loyalty to the Party and the revolutionary cause, and have expressed their aspirations to achieve high technical and cultural levels, as well as communist morality and style in labor and life. Through the "Chollima Workteam" movement, the working people combine communist education, especially the education of revolutionary traditions and the Party's policies, with life, and cultivate themselves into red fighters of the Party and indomitable fighters who are not afraid of any difficulties. In all "Chollima Workteams," there have emerged noble examples of a communist attitude towards labor and state-social property, collectivist thinking, and revolutionary comradely love.

    Li Hyo-sun said that the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party has called on the entire party and all the people to comprehensively launch a technical innovation movement in all sectors of the national economy. Participants in the "Chollima Workteam" movement should take the struggle for technical innovation as their primary task, and should mechanize manual labor everywhere, automate mechanized labor, replace old technologies with new technologies, boldly adopt advanced technologies, and set an example for all working people.

    Li Hyo-sun pointed out that communist education is the most important task of the "Chollima Workteam" movement, and communist education for the working people must be comprehensively strengthened to cultivate a spirit of collectivism.

    Li Hyo-sun then said that the "Chollima Workteam" movement has become a powerful driving force for promoting socialist construction in Korea and a powerful means of arming the working people with communist ideology. In the future, this movement should be actively launched in all departments, all factories and enterprises, and all workteams without exception, and it should be turned into a broader mass movement.

    朝鲜“千里马作业班”运动先进工作者大会开幕
    李孝淳号召加强共产主义教育开展技术革新运动
    据新华社平壤18日电　朝鲜全国“千里马作业班”运动先进工作者大会今天在平壤隆重开幕。参加这个大会的有二千多名“千里马作业班”班长和工会的基层干部。
    朝鲜内阁首相金日成和最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健等党和国家的领导人参加了今天的大会。
    这个为期三天的大会所要讨论的问题是，关于在人民经济各部门全面展开技术革新运动和扩大发展“千里马作业班”运动。朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会委员长李孝淳在今天上午的会议上就这个问题作了报告。
    李孝淳在报告中指出：以发扬劳动人民的高度的积极性和创造性为基础的“千里马作业班”运动，今天已经成为促进朝鲜社会主义建设的强大的推动力。自从降仙炼钢厂陈应源“千里马作业班”班员们发起这一运动后，在一年零五个月内，已发展成为有十七万八千多名劳动人民参加的强有力的群众运动。参加这一运动的八千六百多个作业班中，已有七百六十六个作业班获得了“千里马作业班”的称号，并已有十三个作业班获得双重的“千里马作业班”的称号。今天这一运动，不仅有工厂的工人参加，而且有教育、文化、保健、艺术部门和商业部门等一切经济、文化部门的职工参加，还有二百零七个农业社里的作业班参加了这一运动。
    李孝淳接着谈到“千里马作业班”运动的特点。他说，首先一个重要的特点是参加运动的人们发扬了高度的积极性和创造性，通过集体的技术革新，飞跃地提高了劳动生产率。“千里马作业班”运动的另一特点是运动的参加者在劳动和生活中表现了对党和革命事业的无限忠诚、表现了他们要达到高度的技术、文化水平的志向和共产主义的道德和风格。劳动人民通过“千里马作业班”运动把共产主义教育特别是革命传统和党的政策的教育同生活结合起来，把自己培育锻炼成为党的红色战士和不怕任何困难的不屈的战士。在所有“千里马作业班”中都出现了对劳动和国家社会财产的共产主义态度、集体主义思想和革命的同志友爱的高尚榜样。
    李孝淳说，朝鲜劳动党中央已号召全党和全体人民在人民经济各部门全面展开技术革新运动。“千里马作业班”运动的参加者应把为技术革新而斗争作为自己的首要的任务，要在各处把手工劳动机械化，把机械化了的劳动自动化，以新的技术代替旧的技术，大胆采用先进技术，来为全体劳动人民作出榜样。
    李孝淳指出，共产主义教育是“千里马作业班”运动的最重要的任务，必须全面加强对劳动人民的共产主义教育，要培养集体主义精神。
    李孝淳接着说，“千里马作业班”运动已成为促进朝鲜社会主义建设的强大的推动力和以共产主义思想武装劳动人民的强有力的手段。今后要在一切部门，一切工厂企业，所有的作业班中毫无例外地活跃地展开这一运动，把它变成更为广泛的群众运动。
