    Starting from the Light Smoke from Chimneys

    Whether the smoke from a chimney is heavy or light, black or white, is an indication of whether coal is being wasted or saved. During the coal combustion process, incomplete oxidation produces a free-state gas composed of countless carbon particles, which is what we call smoke. If there are many of these carbon particles, the smoke will be black and dense, indicating that the coal is not burning completely and is being wasted. Conversely, if there are fewer of these carbon particles, the smoke will be white and light, indicating that the coal is burning vigorously and being used economically. Some units used to have chimneys that constantly belched black smoke, so much so that the ground around the factory was often covered with a layer of black ash resembling pepper. This black ash is nothing but uncombusted coal. However, the Tianshenggang Power Plant has saved the state more than 30,000 tons of coal over the years by reducing smoke and emitting light smoke from its chimneys. It is clear that the difference between black and white, dense and light smoke, contains enormous potential for saving coal. Reducing the differences in the color and density of smoke from various chimneys can save a large amount of coal.

    To have chimneys emit less smoke and light smoke, to demand coal from chimneys, is to require every coal-using unit to conscientiously promote the experience of saving coal, eliminate waste, and vigorously conserve coal. There is a lot of "oil" to be tapped in this area. Vigorously promoting coal gasification, plugging loopholes in the transportation, processing, and pulverization processes, and utilizing substitutes such as peat and natural gas can all save coal. Just think: which blast furnace, boiler, brick kiln, train, ship... even the stoves in the canteens of vast urban and rural areas, doesn't have a chimney? Which coal-using unit doesn't have the potential to save coal? Take the promotion of coal gas stoves, for example: once used normally, they can save more than 40 percent of coal. According to statistics, if each coal-using unit in the province reduces its coal consumption by an average of about 20 percent, the coal saved annually would be equivalent to about five months of total coal production in the province. Therefore, we must not underestimate the limited amount of coal saved, but should seriously address the issue of coal conservation.

    Of course, we advocate saving coal bit by bit not only because there is a lot of "oil" to be tapped, but also because it is of great significance. Coal is a material that has a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. Saving coal is closely related to accelerating industrial construction, accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture, and gradually improving people's lives. Imagine: if coal gasification is universally implemented throughout the province, enabling savings of about 35 percent in domestic and general industrial coal consumption, then more than one million tons of coal can be saved annually, which can be used to produce tens of thousands of tons of more steel. This will not only enhance the material strength of industrial and agricultural production and construction, but also greatly benefit reducing the expenses of people's living and gradually improving people's lives. Therefore, we must not regard saving coal as a "none of my business" task, but should regard it as the business of each enterprise, each unit, and every household.

    How to effectively save coal? The key lies in raising people's awareness and correcting their understanding of saving coal. If everyone can establish the idea of building the country diligently and frugally, and running all undertakings diligently and frugally, if every unit forms a culture of being honored for saving coal and ashamed of wasting coal, then everyone will actively try to find ways to make unremitting efforts to save one jin or two of coal. To achieve this, party organizations at all levels must earnestly conduct political and ideological work among the vast number of workers and the masses.

### 从烟囱冒淡烟谈起

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    从烟囱冒淡烟谈起
    烟囱冒的烟多还是少、冒黑烟还是冒白烟，这是用煤浪费还是节约的一个标志。煤炭在燃烧过程中，由于氧化不足，会产生一种由无数碳素颗粒组成的游离状气体，这就是所谓烟。这种碳素颗粒多了，烟就由黑而浓，表明煤炭燃烧不透，产生浪费；反之，这种碳素颗粒少，烟就由白而淡，表明煤炭烧得旺，煤炭用得省。曾有这样一些单位，烟囱里经常突突地大冒黑烟，以致工厂周围的地面上，经常复盖着一层像胡椒末那样的黑灰。这黑灰不是别的，正是没有充分燃烧了的煤炭。而天生港电厂，由于做到烟囱少冒烟、冒淡烟，几年来已为国家节省了三万多吨煤炭。可见，烟之一黑一白、一浓一淡之间，蕴藏着节约用煤的巨大潜力。缩小各个烟囱冒烟黑白、浓淡的差异，就可以大量节约煤炭。
    让烟囱少冒烟、冒淡烟，向烟囱要煤炭，就是要每一个用煤单位都来踏踏实实地推广节约用煤的经验，杜绝浪费，大力节约用煤。这方面的“油水”大得很。大搞煤气化，堵塞运输、加工、粉碎过程中的浪费漏洞，利用泥炭、天然气等代用品，等等，都可以节约用煤。试想一想：哪个高炉、锅炉、砖窑、列车、轮船……上，以至广大城乡的食堂的炉灶上，没有烟囱呢？哪一个用煤单位没有节约用煤的潜力可挖呢？就拿推广煤气炉经验来说，一经正常使用，就可节约用煤百分之四十以上。根据统计，全省每个用煤单位只要平均降低用煤量百分之二十上下，全年节省的煤炭，就相当于全省煤矿五个月左右的总产量。因此，我们决不能认为节约用煤量有限，有所轻视，而应该严肃对待节约用煤问题。
    当然，我们提倡点滴节约煤炭，不仅因为它的“油水”大，而且因为它的意义大。煤炭是一项对国计民生有着重大影响的物资。节约用煤，不论对加速工业建设，加速农业的技术改造，或是对人民生活的逐步改善，都有着十分密切的关系。可以设想一下：如果全省普遍推行煤气化，使生活用煤和一般工业用煤能够节约百分之三十五左右的话，那么，一年就可以节省一百多万吨煤炭，可以多炼几十万吨钢铁，这不仅可以增强工农业生产建设事业的物质力量，而且对于减少人民生活费用的支出，逐步改善人民生活也是大有好处的。因此，我们决不应当把节约用煤看成是“与己无关”的工作，而应当看成是各企业各单位，千家万户自己的事情。
    怎样有效地节约煤炭？关键在于提高人们的觉悟，端正对节约用煤的认识。如果每个人都能树立勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的思想，如果每个单位都形成了节约煤炭光荣、浪费煤炭可耻的风气，那末，大家就会主动地去想方设法，为节约一斤、一两煤炭作坚持不懈的努力。要做到这一点，就要靠各级党组织在广大职工和人民群众中认真进行政治思想工作。
