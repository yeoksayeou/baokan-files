    Comparison
    He Minglou, Fitter, Harbin Jiancheng Machinery Factory
    The development of things is always uneven. Unevenness leads to differences, and differences lead to comparison. In revolutionary work, we often use the method of "comparison" to transform the backward into the advanced, and the advanced into the even more advanced.
    However, some people are afraid of "comparison," arguing: "So-and-so's political consciousness is really high, so-and-so has so many inventions, so-and-so... how can we compare!" The next sentence is always: "Let's not compare!"
    We say that there are differences between the advanced, the intermediate, and the backward among the people, but it is by no means immutable. Someone being advanced is not innate, but the result of the Party's teachings and individual efforts.
    We advocate "comparison" precisely because "comparison" can help us discover the strengths of others and realize our own shortcomings, thereby learning from each other's strengths and overcoming our weaknesses, and promoting our own progress.
    We advocate "comparison" also because "comparison" can make people look forward, make the backward strive to catch up, and make the advanced not complacent or stagnant; it can encourage and promote comrades to improve together.
    Among our comparators, there is a relationship of comrades, a relationship of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and improving together, accelerating socialist construction, not for mutual exclusion, not for personal fame and gain. Therefore, in the process of "comparison," everyone can become an advanced person, the key lies in whether one can muster enough energy, strive for the upstream, and aim at advanced indicators and advanced levels.
    We hope that those who are afraid of "comparison" will muster their energy, bravely participate in comparison, compare with the advanced, compare with the most advanced, and at the same time, make themselves a benchmark for others to "compare"!
    There are also a very few people who like to "compare," but the conditions for their "comparison" are different from ours. They compare treatment, compare enjoyment, compare comfort... Such "comparison" will create an atmosphere of corruption. People who "compare" in this way will become more and more backward, and will increasingly deviate from socialism.
    We advocate "comparison" that compares redness in political thought, expertise in professional skills, quantity, speed, quality and economy in production, hard work and simplicity in life, loyalty to the cause, and contributions to the revolution. When we compare in this way, we will become more and more advanced, and the cause of socialism will become more and more prosperous.
    We hope that those who like to compare treatment and enjoyment will turn back quickly and join the great ranks of comparing advancedness and contributions, and contribute greater and more strength to our country's socialist construction!

    比
    哈尔滨建成机械厂钳工　何明楼
    事物的发展总是不平衡的。不平衡，就有差别，有差别，就有比较。在革命工作中，我们就常用“比”的方法，使落后的变为先进，使先进的更为先进。
    可是，有些人怕“比”，议论起来：“谁谁的政治觉悟真高，谁谁的发明创造真多，谁谁……，咱们哪里比去！”下一句话便是：“不比了！”
    我们说，人民内部有先进、中间和落后的差别，但它绝不是一成不变的。某人先进，并不是生就先进，而是党的教导、个人努力的结果。
    我们提倡“比”，就是因为“比”可以发现别人的长处，觉察自己的短处，从而取长补短，推动自己前进。
    我们提倡“比”，还因为“比”可以使人的眼睛向前看，使落后的奋起直追，使先进的不自满、不停步；使同志之间互相激励、互相促进。
    在我们的比较者之间，是同志的关系，是比先进，学先进，赶先进，共同提高，加速社会主义建设，而不是为了互相排斥，不是为了个人名利。因此，在“比”的中间，人人都可能成为先进者，关键就在于能否鼓足干劲，力争上游，向先进的指标、先进的水平看齐。
    希望怕“比”的人鼓足干劲，勇敢地参加比，和先进者比，和最先进者比，同时，使自己也成为别人“比”的标兵！
    也有极少数人喜欢“比”，可是“比”的条件和我们不同，他们是比待遇、比享受、比安逸……。这样的“比”，会造成腐败的空气。这样“比”的人，会越比越后退，会越比越和社会主义背道而驰。
    我们提倡“比”，是比政治思想上的红，比业务技术上的专，比生产上的多快好省，比生活上的艰苦朴素，比对事业的忠诚，比对革命的贡献。我们这样比，会越比越前进，越比，社会主义事业越兴旺。
    希望喜欢比待遇、比享受的人赶紧回头，投身到比先进、比贡献的伟大行列中来，为我国的社会主义建设，贡献更大的更多的力量！
