Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 28th:  Primary and secondary schools throughout the Soviet Union are currently actively preparing to welcome the new school year.

    In order to complete the national education reform work more quickly, more seven-year and ten-year schools will be converted into eight-year and eleven-year schools in the upcoming new school year. In addition, amateur education for workers, peasants, and youth will be vigorously developed.

    In the past year, Soviet primary and secondary schools have achieved preliminary results in strengthening the connection between education and production, and have accumulated certain experiences. Many urban primary and secondary schools have established fixed relationships with factories and enterprises. With the help of factories, many schools have established school labor workshops to cultivate students' labor perspectives and enable them to master basic skills. Senior students regularly participate in labor in factories.

    The Uzbek Republic established a total of 2,340 school workshops last year, and many factories also sent engineers, technicians, and workers to schools to teach. Schools in cities such as Moscow, Mogilev, and Almaty have also established close ties with local factories.

    In rural schools throughout the Soviet Union, organizing student production teams and establishing teaching experimental fields has become the main form of connecting education with production. In Belarus, there are currently 1,500 such student production teams. Many students automatically stay to work on collective farms after graduation. For example, the "July 12th" Collective Farm in the Svisky District of Belarus accepted 100 middle school graduates to work this summer.

    In Uzbekistan, there are a total of 1,655 student production teams, and they have achieved good results in cotton planting, sericulture, and animal husbandry.

    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, August 29th:  Mongolian students at all levels of schools have happily spent their summer vacation and are actively preparing to welcome the new school year of 1960-1961.

    This year, schools at all levels in Mongolia will add a batch of new students. More than 400 primary and secondary schools distributed in urban and rural areas across the country will have more than 19,000 new students enrolled this year, and the total number of students will reach more than 104,000.

    During this summer vacation, students from various places have participated in industrial and agricultural production labor on construction sites, farms, and cooperatives, creating wealth for the country, learning production knowledge, and strengthening labor training.

    In the new school year, all school-age children in Mongolia will receive primary education. Children in cities will receive seven-year education.

    In the new school year, teachers and students will greet the 40th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution in 1961 with new teaching achievements under the slogan of "working, studying, and living in a socialist way."

    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 27th:  Bulgarian secondary education is closely linked with production. In the past year, nearly 61,000 students in the tenth and eleventh grades (equivalent to Chinese secondary schools) across the country have participated in production internships in factories, enterprises, and agricultural production cooperatives. Almost all eleventh-grade students in secondary comprehensive technical schools across the country have participated in production exams, and the vast majority of students have reached the technical level of Grade 2 to Grade 4 workers, and some students have even reached the technical level of Grade 5 workers.

    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 26th:  Romanian university students actively participate in production internships and voluntary labor during the summer vacation.

    This year, a total of 3,000 engineering students in 克罗什城 participated in production internships. They are all assigned to factories and farms across the country for internships according to their majors in a planned manner. University students' participation in production internships is an important part of university education. During production internships, they must participate in actual production, master a production technology, and complete a certain production quota. Universities and enterprises that accept student internships attach great importance to students' production internships and have specially established committees to lead students' internship work. During production internships, workers help students meticulously, trying their best to enable them to comprehensively and firmly master a variety of production knowledge. They must pass an examination at the end of their internship. During the summer vacation, liberal arts students who do not participate in production internships actively form patriotic voluntary labor teams to participate in urban public welfare labor or rural summer harvest work.

    罗马尼亚大学生暑假参加劳动生产
    新华社莫斯科28日电　苏联各地中小学目前正在积极准备迎接新学年。
    为了更快地完成国民教育改革工作，在即将开始的新学年中将有更多的七年制和十年制学校改建成八年制和十一年制学校。此外，还将大力发展工农青年的业余教育。
    在过去一年内，苏联中小学在加强教育与生产的联系方面取得了初步成绩，并且积累了一定的经验。许多城市的中小学与工厂企业建立了固定的联系。在工厂的帮助下，许多学校建立了学校劳动车间，以培养学生的劳动观点，使他们掌握基本技术。高级班的学生则定期到工厂参加劳动。
    乌兹别克共和国去年一年内共建立了二千三百四十个学校车间，许多工厂还派了工程师、技师和工人到学校教课。在莫斯科、莫吉略夫、阿拉木图等市的学校也分别与本市的工厂建立了密切的联系。
    在苏联各地农村学校中，组织学生生产队、建立教学试验田，已经成为教育与生产相联系的主要形式。在白俄罗斯，目前这样的学生生产队共有一千五百个。许多学生在毕业后自动留在农庄工作。例如白俄罗斯?斯维斯基区的“7月12日”集体农庄今年夏天就接受了一百个中学毕业生工作。
    在乌兹别克，学生生产队共有一千六百五十五个，他们在植棉、养蚕和畜牧业方面取得了良好的成绩。
    新华社乌兰巴托29日电　蒙古各级学校学生欢度了暑假，正在积极准备迎接1960—1961年新学年。
    今年蒙古各级学校都将增加一批新生。分布在全国城乡各地的四百多所中、小学今年将有一万九千多名新生入学，学生总数将达到十万零四千多人。
    在今年暑假期间，各地学生曾经分别到建筑工地、农牧场和合作社参加工业和农牧业的生产劳动，为国家创造了财富，学习了生产知识，加强了劳动锻炼。
    在新学年里，蒙古适龄儿童将全部受到初等教育。城市的儿童将受到七年制教育。
    在新的学年里，师生们将在“按社会主义方式工作、学习和生活”的口号下，以新的教学成绩迎接1961年蒙古人民革命四十周年。
    新华社索非亚27日电　保加利亚中等教育同生产密切联系。全国近一年来已经有六万一千名十和十一年级（相当于中国的中等学校）的学生参加了工厂、企业和农业生产合作社的生产实习。全国中等综合技术学校十一年级的学生差不多都参加了生产考试，并且绝大多数学生都达到了二级至四级工的技术水平，有一部分学生甚至达到了五级工的技术水平。
    新华社布加勒斯特26日电　罗马尼亚大学生在暑假期间积极参加生产实习和义务劳动。
    克罗什城今年一共有三千名工科学生参加生产实习。他们都按专业有计划地被分配到全国各工厂和农场实习。大学生参加生产实习是大学教育中重要的一个环节。在生产实习时，他们要参加实际生产，掌握一种生产技术，完成一定的生产定额。各大学和接受学生实习的企业都很重视学生的生产实习，专门设立了领导学生的实习工作的委员会。在生产实习中，工人们无微不至地帮助学生，尽量使他们全面和牢固地掌握多种生产知识。他们在实习结束的时候，都要通过一次考试。在暑假期间，不参加生产实习的文科学生，都踊跃地组成爱国义务劳动队，参加城市的公益劳动或农村的夏收工作。
