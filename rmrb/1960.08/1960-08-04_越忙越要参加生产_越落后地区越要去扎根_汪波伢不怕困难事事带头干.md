The Busier You Are, the More You Must Participate in Production; The More Backward the Area, the More You Must Take Root There – Wang Boya Fears No Difficulties and Always Takes the Lead

(Our Report) In Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, no one fails to praise the production and life in the Fuxing Management District of Wangji Commune. When people praise this management district, they always talk about Wang Boya, the secretary of the Party General Branch there (now the deputy secretary of the Commune Party Committee and concurrently the secretary of the Fuxing Party General Branch).

Last spring, the General Branch discussed the issue of balanced production increase. Everyone said that the Second Team was the most backward and difficult to handle. Wang Boya was the first to volunteer to go to the Second Team. When he arrived at the Second Team, everyone said that the Seventh Sub-team was the most difficult to manage, so he immediately moved to the Seventh Sub-team to live. At that time, some people worried about him: "That sub-team has many people with backward ideas, many mischievous people, many bad fields, and many households in overdraft, so it's not easy to manage! If you get stuck there, how can the work of the entire management district be done?" Wang Boya was unwavering. He said that to make a revolution, one must go to the most arduous and difficult places; helping the backward catch up with the advanced makes the work more convincing. As long as you rely on the poor peasants and grasp the demands of the broad masses, there is nothing that cannot be done well.

He quickly understood the characteristics of this sub-team, which had little land and poor fields. At a meeting, he discussed with the masses the issue of converting slopes into paddy fields and expanding the area of multiple cropping. A well-to-do middle peasant, Fan Baotian, quickly said, "We have worked here all our lives, who doesn't want to increase production? But it's just beyond us! Few people, lack of fertilizer, poor water sources, it's all in vain even if we work ourselves to death." The poor peasants couldn't accept this. Fan Hanqing couldn't help but retort on the spot: "It's just that you haven't thought about it; if you think about it, you can do it!" Wang Boya paid close attention to this situation. The next day, he invited Fan Hanqing to work in the fields and talk while producing. Seeing that Wang Boya was so kind and enthusiastic about labor, Fan Hanqing felt that he was truly someone who was working for him and reflected many situations to him. After Wang Boya grasped these situations, he convened a meeting of poor peasants and jointly decided to convert twenty-five mu of slope land into paddy fields, and led Fan Hanqing and other seven poor peasants to carry out a test field on a backward area of ninety-four mu. They carted river mud and carried river silt, collected green manure everywhere, deep plowing of eight inches, and reasonable close planting, so that the production outlook of this backward area was completely renewed. As a result, the enthusiasm of the members of the whole team to catch up with the advanced was set off, and they launched a major campaign towards backward fields. As a result, more than one hundred mu of low-yield fields were completely changed, and the average yield per mu increased from three hundred jin to eight hundred jin. The grain output of the entire sub-team tripled, and the income increased twofold, with surplus grain in every household. The members said: "If the Party hadn't sent Secretary Wang to our place to plant experimental fields, we would still be a household in overdraft!" Grasping the backward, catching up with the advanced, and balanced production increase are Wang Boya's consistent leadership methods.

Wang Boya has a work habit, that is, "three brings" when going out: bring a hoe, bring a manure basket, bring a labor manual; "three haves" when entering the door: have wild manure, have work points, have information about the members. Relying on his "three brings" and "three haves," relying on his farming skills learned when he worked as a long-term laborer for more than ten years before liberation, regardless of the cold or hot weather, regardless of wind or rain, he always eats, lives, labors, and consults with the members. He often says to people: "Ideological work must meet people, and production work must meet the land." "The busier you are, the more you must participate in labor."

Grasping the key in labor and solving problems on the spot are the characteristics of Wang Boya's work. One morning, he carried a manure basket, picking manure and inspecting work. When he came to the D묘 Fan of the Fourth Team, he happened to see the members weeding here discussing. Poor peasant Xiao Weifu said: "The wheat is turning yellow, what's the point of weeding?!" Wang Boya continued: "Can't we think of a way to turn it from yellow to green?" The branch secretary of the production team was a little confused. He said: "Without chemical fertilizer, how can it change!" Wang Boya pointed to his manure basket and said, "Isn't this method possible?" A well-to-do middle peasant smiled coldly: "It's possible, but by the time it works, the wheat will be harvested." Wang Boya felt that the current lack of confidence of some cadres and the masses in eliminating third-class seedlings and striving for balanced production increase was a common problem, so he decided to set up camp in the backward D묘 Fan, take the lead in upgrading seedlings, and be sure to inspire people's confidence in carrying out the balanced production increase movement. Therefore, he personally led more than one hundred members to the Zhangdu Lake to collect cow manure, goose manure, and harvest green manure. At the same time, he mobilized members to carry out a large-scale sanitation and fertilizer accumulation campaign. As a result, Wang Boya earned thirty-nine work points here in three days and led the masses to collect a total of twelve thousand jin of manure and accumulated twenty-seven thousand dan of miscellaneous fertilizer, applying a dose of quick-acting fertilizer to the wheat seedlings in D묘 Fan, so that this backward seedling quickly caught up with the advanced seedlings. Wang Boya seized this typical example and timely convened an on-site meeting to criticize the conservative ideas of a few people on "eliminating third-class seedlings and realizing balanced production increase" with facts. Since then, the whole district quickly launched a upsurge of "learning from D묘 Fan, catching up with D묘 Fan," and quickly eliminated more than two thousand mu of third-class seedlings and realized balanced production increase.

The members said: "Secretary Wang stands high and sees far." That is to say, he always advances bravely with the spirit of continuous revolution. After a bumper autumn harvest last year, the Party General Branch proposed to go to the next level and leap towards the new goal of five "ten thousands" (the whole management district to achieve ten thousand mu of paddy fields, ten thousand mu of dry land, ten thousand pigs, ten thousand jin of grain per household, and ten thousand jin of vegetables). However, when it came to wasteland reclamation and expansion of the area, some ideological obstacles were encountered. At that time, some people said: "If you take care of wasteland reclamation, you can't take care of drought resistance, harvest protection, and field management." In order to solve this contradiction, Wang Boya took a carpenter to the Liji Commune to learn the experience of making animal-powered waterwheels. When he returned, he mobilized the masses to make twelve animal-powered waterwheels, one hundred and twenty animal-powered carts, and more than five hundred other types of vehicles. This greatly saved labor and increased work efficiency by more than four times. The masses were more and more happy, and they all said: "Secretary Wang always thinks of ways for us, and we will listen to him in the future." As a result, while achieving drought resistance and a bumper harvest, they increased the planting of more than three hundred and twenty mu of wheat, more than one thousand four hundred mu of vegetables, and more than eight hundred mu of buckwheat on the newly reclaimed wasteland. This summer harvest not only increased the output but also guaranteed the supply of vegetables for the members.

Wang Boya, no matter when, always grasps production by grasping life. One day, he rushed to the Seventh Sub-team of the Second Team late at night, just in time to see the cadres of this team studying the issue of eating pasta in the canteen. Some said: "There will be no flour in the canteen to cook tomorrow morning, what should we do?" "The wheat can't be milled, what can we do? We have to eat wheat porridge!" "Eating wheat porridge is wasteful and unpalatable, it's better to simply distribute it to the households to avoid trouble." Wang Boya continued: "What kind of solution is this? Isn't this retreating in the face of difficulties? Come on, if there's no cooking tomorrow morning, let's grind the flour tonight!" The next morning, the canteen did not eat wheat porridge, but let the members eat good pasta, and the members all felt strange. Later, after inquiring, it turned out that Secretary Wang had ground it out overnight, and everyone was very moved. Now, in the Fuxing Management District, every canteen has a fixed vegetable garden and raises pigs and fish. (Yu Zhouren) (Attached picture)

    越忙越要参加生产　越落后地区越要去扎根
    汪波伢不怕困难事事带头干
    本报讯　在湖北省新洲县，提起汪集公社复兴管理区的生产、生活，没有人不夸奖。人们在夸奖这个管理区的时候，总爱谈到这里的党总支书记汪波伢（现任公社党委副书记兼复兴党总支书记）。
    去年春天，总支讨论平衡增产问题，大家都说二队最落后，不好办。汪波伢第一个要求到二队。到了二队，又都说七小队最难搞，他又一下子搬到七小队住下来。当时，有人替他担心：“那个小队思想落后的人多，调皮的人多，坏田多，超支户多，可不好搞呀！你陷到那里，全管理区的工作怎么搞？”汪波伢毫不动摇，他说干革命就得到最艰苦、最困难的地方去；帮助落后赶上先进，工作就更有说服力。只要依靠贫农，抓住广大群众的要求，没有办不好的事。
    他很快了解到这个小队地少田坏的特点，在一次会议上和群众商量改坡地为水田和扩大复种面积的问题。富裕中农范保田连忙说：“我们在这里干了一辈子，哪个不想增产？就是不由人想么！人少肥缺水源差，累死也白搭。”这话贫农听不进去，范汉卿忍不住当场顶了他一句：“就是没想到，想到就办得了！”汪波伢很注意这个情况，第二天便约范汉卿一道下田，边生产边交谈。范汉卿看到汪波伢这么亲切，这么热心劳动，感到他真是替自己办事的人，便向他反映了许多情况。汪波伢掌握了这些情况以后，就召开贫农会，共同决定把二十五亩坡地改成水田，并领导范汉卿等七个贫农在一个九十四亩的落后冲种试验田。他们车干河垱挑河泥，到处打青积肥，深耕八寸，合理密植，使这个落后冲的生产面貌焕然一新。这一来，全队社员掀起了落后赶先进的高潮，向落后田大进军。结果一百多亩低产田全部改观，平均单产由三百斤提高到八百斤。全小队粮食增产三倍，收入增加两倍，户户有余粮。社员们说：“要不是党派汪书记到我们这里来种试验田，我们还是个超支户！”抓落后，赶先进，平衡增产，这就是汪波伢一贯的领导方法。
    汪波伢工作有一个习惯，就是出门“三带”：带锄头，带粪筐，带劳动手册；进门“三有”：有野粪，有工分，有社员的情况。凭着他这个“三带”、“三有”，凭着他在解放前打十几年长工时那套种田的本事，不管天寒地冻，不管炎天暑热，不管刮风下雨，总是和社员们同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。他常常对人说：“思想工作要见人，生产工作要见地”“越忙越要参加劳动”。
    在劳动中抓关键，在现场解决问题，这是汪波伢工作的特点。一天上午，他背着粪筐，一面拣粪，一面检查工作。来到四队的大庙畈，正碰上这里锄草的社员议论纷纷。贫农萧为福说：“眼看麦子都黄了，还锄什么？！”汪波伢接着说：“不能想办法，要它由黄变青么？”生产队的支部书记有点不通，他说：“没有化肥追，怎么变呢！”汪波伢指着自己的粪筐说：“用这个办法不行？”一位富裕中农冷冷地笑道：“行倒行，等到行了的时候，麦子也就要割了。”汪波伢感到当前部分干部和群众对消灭三类苗，争取平衡增产的信心不大，是带有普遍性的问题，便决定在落后的大庙畈安营扎寨，带头搞禾苗升级，定要鼓起人们开展平衡增产运动的信心。于是，亲自带领一百多个社员到涨渡湖去收拣牛粪、雁粪、打青，同时，发动社员大搞卫生积肥，结果，汪波伢在这里三天内做了三十九个工分，带领群众共拣了一万二千斤粪，积了二万七千担杂肥，给大庙畈的麦苗普遍施了一道速效肥，使这片落后苗很快地赶上了先进苗。汪波伢抓住这个典型，又及时召开现场会，用事实批判了少数人对“消灭三类苗，实现平衡增产”的保守思想。从此，全区迅速开展了一个“学大庙畈，赶大庙畈”的热潮，很快地消灭了二千多亩三类苗，实现了平衡增产。
    社员们说：“汪书记站得高，看得远。”这就是说，他始终以不断革命的精神，迎难猛进。去年获得秋季大丰收以后，党总支提出要更上一层楼，向五个“万”字（全管理区实现万亩田、万亩地、万头猪、每户万斤粮、万斤菜）的新目标跃进。可是，一提到开荒，扩大面积的时候，就遇到一些思想阻碍。当时有些人说：“顾上开荒，就顾不上抗旱保收和田间管理。”汪波伢为了解决这个矛盾，带着木匠赶到李集公社去学习制畜力水车的经验，回来，发动群众动手，制成畜力水车十二乘，畜力大车一百二十辆，和其他各式车子五百多辆。这就大大节约了劳力，提高了工效四倍多。群众越干越欢，都说：“汪书记处处替我们想办法，往后干什么，都要听他的。”结果，取得抗旱保丰收的同时，在新开垦的荒地上增种了三百二十多亩小麦、一千四百多亩蔬菜和八百多亩荞麦，今年夏收不仅增加了产量，而且保证了社员蔬菜的供应。
    汪波伢无论在什么时候，都是通过抓生活来抓生产的。有一天，他深夜赶到二队七小队，正碰上这个队的干部在研究食堂吃面食问题。有的说：“明天早晨食堂就没有面粉开火，怎么办？”“麦子磨不出来，有什么办法？只好吃麦米粥！”“吃麦米粥，又浪费又不好吃，不如干脆下放了，免得麻烦。”汪波伢接着说：“这叫什么办法？这不是见困难走退坡路？来，明天早晨没有开火的，我们今天晚上磨出面来吧！”第二天早晨，食堂果然没有吃麦米粥，而让社员吃了好面食，社员都觉着奇怪。后来一打听，原来是汪书记连夜磨出来的，大家都很感动。现在，在复兴管理区，无论哪一个食堂，都有固定菜园，并且养了猪和鱼。　（于洲人）（附图片）
