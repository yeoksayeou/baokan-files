Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 6th. Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces Minister Raúl Castro condemned U.S. anti-Cuban subversive activities in a television speech last night.

	Raúl Castro said that Cuban authorities arrested two diplomats from the U.S. Embassy in June while they were meeting with counter-revolutionary conspirators in a house. Raúl Castro presented photos of the two spies at the time of their arrest as evidence. He said that these two individuals, registered as diplomatic officials of the U.S. Embassy in Cuba, Friedman and Swett, were agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and were also Nazis.

	Raúl Castro said that Cuban intelligence agencies reported after investigating their espionage activities that these two agents granted asylum to counter-revolutionaries and funded counter-revolutionary activities with weapons and money. Raúl presented documents proving that Friedman had worked for the FBI for twenty years and that his wife also worked there. Swett, on the other hand, had been engaged in espionage activities in Cuba since 1940, persecuting communists and progressives. Raúl also presented evidence proving that they were once Hitler's spies.

	In his speech, Raúl Castro also spoke about his recent visits to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and the United Arab Republic.

    古巴当局逮捕两名美国特务外交人员
    劳尔·卡斯特罗谴责美国的颠覆活动
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　古巴革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗昨晚在电视演说中谴责美国进行反古巴的颠覆活动。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗说，古巴当局在6月逮捕了正在一间房屋中同反革命阴谋分子开会的美国大使馆的两个外交人员。劳尔·卡斯特罗拿出了这两个间谍被捕时的照片为证。他说，这两个以美国驻古巴大使馆外交官员的身份登记的人员弗里德曼和斯威特是属于美国联邦调查局的特务，他们同时还是纳粹分子。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗说，古巴情报机关在对他们的间谍活动进行调查后报告说，这两个特务给予反革命分子避难权，还以武器和金钱资助反革命活动。劳尔拿出了表明弗里德曼在联邦调查局工作了二十年以及他妻子也在那里工作的文件作为证明。斯威特则从1940年起已经在古巴从事特务活动，对共产党人和进步人士进行迫害。劳尔还拿出了证明他们曾是希特勒间谍的证据。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗在演说中还谈了他最近对苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和阿联的访问。
