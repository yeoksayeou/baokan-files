Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, August 28th: The autumn harvest work has universally unfolded in all parts of Mongolia. State-owned agricultural and pastoral farms and agricultural and pastoral cooperatives are launching socialist labor competitions to ensure the completion of the autumn harvest work entirely within twelve days, starting from late August, and to overfulfill the task of delivering grain to the state.

This year, Mongolia has sown crops on over 252,000 hectares of land, an unprecedented expansion of the sown area. Due to timely sowing and favorable weather this year, grain crops are growing vigorously, and yields will greatly increase compared to previous years. Last year, the average grain yield per hectare was 11.5 quintals. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, this year it could reach 14-15 quintals.

The Mongolian newspaper "Unen" has put forward the slogan "Strive to harvest 12.5 million poods of grain (one pood equals 32.76 jin)," If this slogan is realized, this year's harvest will increase by more than 4 million poods of grain compared to the bumper year of 1959.

As early as June and July, Mongolian agricultural and pastoral farms and machine stations took measures to repair machinery and organize manpower to prepare for the autumn harvest. Currently, more than 1,600 combine harvesters, more than 1,200 trucks, and other agricultural machines are participating in the harvest across the country.

More than 7,000 university and secondary technical school students, as well as a large number of workers and soldiers, are helping with the autumn harvest in various places.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 27th: Hungary's summer harvest work ended in mid-August, ten days earlier than last year. Threshing and storage work will also be completed in the coming days.

According to preliminary statistical data from the Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture, this year's grain production plan will be overfulfilled by 5%. The average grain harvest of state farms is 40%-45% higher than that of individual farmers; agricultural production cooperatives are 25%-30% higher than individual farmers. The harvest of newly established agricultural production cooperatives last year was also 15% higher than that of individual farmers.

This year, the grain sold to the state by all the collectivized counties has exceeded any year under individual management. The first collectivized county in the country, Győr-Sopron County, has already delivered 4,000 train cars of grain to the state; this year, the county will deliver at least 900 train cars more grain to the state than before collectivization. Somogy County has delivered a total of 1,200 train cars of grain to the state this year, compared to only 340 train cars last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 28th: The summer harvest work in Czechoslovakia has entered its final stage. 80% of the country's grain has been harvested, of which 50% has been transported from the fields.

Although weather conditions were unfavorable this year, the yield per unit area of ​​major crops has still increased compared to last year. According to estimates by the Czechoslovak Ministry of Agriculture, the average yield of barley can reach 23.3 quintals per hectare, compared to 21.7 quintals last year.

This year's summer harvest was carried out under intense struggle against bad weather. In order not to miss the harvesting opportunity, agricultural laborers in various places demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm. In the rush harvest, they received strong assistance from about 100,000 to 150,000 workers, soldiers, cadres and young people every day. The Czechoslovak government called on all government agencies and enterprises to send 20% of their workforce in rotation to support the summer harvest and 50% of their transportation vehicles to carry summer harvest crops. Last Saturday and Sunday alone, 200,000 people and 11,000 trucks participated in voluntary summer harvest labor nationwide. In flood-stricken areas, People's Army soldiers became the shock force for rushing to harvest and transport grain. The 5,500 volunteer labor teams organized by the Youth League also contributed 2 million work hours.

At the same time, the grain purchasing work is also being stepped up. So far, farmers have completed about 76% of the sales tasks; the purchasing plan, originally scheduled to be completed on September 30, is expected to be completed in a few days.

    蒙古秋收普遍展开匈捷夏收情况良好
    新华社乌兰巴托28日电　蒙古全国各地的农业秋收工作已经普遍展开。国营农牧场和农牧业合作社纷纷开展社会主义劳动竞赛，保证从8月下旬开始在十二天内全部完成秋收工作，并超额完成上缴国家粮食的任务。
    今年蒙古在二十五万二千多公顷土地上播种了农作物，播种面积空前扩大。由于今年播种适时，气候良好，谷物生长旺盛，产量将比往年大大增多。去年每公顷谷物的平均产量为十一点五公担，据农牧部负责人估计，今年可达十四—十五公担。
    蒙古“真理报”提出了“为收获一千二百五十万普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤）谷物而奋斗”的口号，如果这个口号实现，今年的收成将比丰收的1959年增加四百多万普特谷物。
    早在6、7月间，蒙古各农牧场机器站就采取措施，检修机器，组织人力，作好秋收准备工作。目前，全国有一千六百多台联合收割机、一千二百多辆载重汽车和其他农业机器参加收割。
    蒙古有七千多名大学生和中等技术学校的学生以及大批工人和军人在各地帮助秋收。
    新华社布达佩斯27日电　匈牙利的夏收工作已比去年提早十天，在8月中旬结束。打谷入仓工作也将在日内全部完成。
    根据匈牙利农业部的初步统计材料，今年粮食的生产计划将超额5％完成。国营农场粮食的收成平均比个体农民高40％—45％；农业生产合作社比个体农民高25％—30％。去年新成立的农业生产合作社的收成也比个体农民高15％。
    今年，已经全部合作化的各个州交售给国家的粮食，超过了个体经营时的任何一年。全国第一个合作化的州——吉厄尔—索普伦州已经交售给国家四千车皮粮食；今年全州交给国家的粮食至少将比未合作化以前要多九百车皮。绍莫吉州今年总共交售给国家一千二百车皮粮食，而去年只有三百四十车皮。
    新华社布拉格28日电　捷克斯洛伐克的夏收工作已经进入了最后阶段。全国80％的谷物已经收割完毕，其中50％已从田间运走。
    今年尽管气候条件恶劣，但主要作物的单位面积产量仍比去年有所增加。据捷克斯洛伐克农业部估计，大麦平均每公顷可以收二十三点三公担，而去年是二十一点七公担。
    今年的夏收是在与坏天气作紧张斗争的情况下进行的。为了不错过收割的时机，各地的农业劳动者表现出了高度的劳动热情。在抢收工作中，他们每天大约得到十万到十五万的工人、士兵、机关干部和青年们的大力帮助。捷克斯洛伐克政府号召各机关、企业轮流抽调20％的人力去支援夏收、50％的运输工具去载运夏收作物。仅在上星期六和星期日，全国参加夏收义务劳动的就有二十万人和一万一千辆货车。在洪水成灾的地区，人民军战士成为抢收、抢运谷物的突击力量。青年联盟组织的五千五百个志愿劳动队，也作了二百万个工时。
    和这同时，谷物的收购工作也在加紧进行。到目前为止，农民们已经完成了76％左右的交售任务；原定在9月30日完成的收购计划，可望在数日内完成。
