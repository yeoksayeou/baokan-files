    Xining, August 19th (By our newspaper) - Houzihe Commune in the suburbs of Xining City, Qinghai Province, comprehensively and rationally arranged its labor force to strengthen the agricultural front. Recently, based on the principle of running commune-run industries and sideline occupations more during the agricultural slack season and less during the busy season, the commune transferred more than 1,200 people from commune-run industries, sideline occupations, and service industries such as canteens to strengthen the front line of agricultural production, making the labor force engaged in agriculture reach 82% of the total labor force, which strongly strengthened the current field production.
    Houzihe Commune has 31 production teams and 10,889 laborers. Previously, the commune had more than 7,940 laborers engaged in agricultural production, accounting for 73% of the total labor force; commune-run enterprises had 500 people, accounting for 4.6% of the total labor force; sideline production had 500 people, accounting for 4.6%; living welfare undertakings had 1,219 people, accounting for 11.2%; and livestock breeding had 718 people, accounting for 6.6%. The labor force not directly engaged in agriculture accounted for 27% of the total labor force. This proportion was relatively appropriate in previous years or during the agricultural slack season, but this year, in order to accelerate the development of grain production, Houzihe Commune has reclaimed a large amount of wasteland, and the planting area has been expanded by more than 50,000 mu compared with last year, of which grain crops alone have been expanded by more than 29,000 mu. According to the average area of grain crops borne by each laborer last year, it is necessary to increase 5,800 laborers, while at present, on the one hand, it is necessary to rush to harvest summer crops, and on the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen the late-stage field management of early rice and the field management of late rice, as well as prepare for next year's production. Therefore, increasing the agricultural labor force is very necessary.
    How to solve this problem? After analysis and research, the commune party committee believes that in addition to vigorously carrying out tool reforms and improving labor productivity, it is necessary to tap the labor potential from commune-run industries and other aspects to enrich and strengthen the agricultural front. The party committee handed over this issue to the cadres and the masses for discussion, explained the agricultural situation to the commune members, and presented the labor force usage situation to unify their thinking and understanding. Then, a comprehensive adjustment and arrangement of the commune's labor force was carried out. For commune-run industries, in addition to ensuring the normal production of factories that directly serve agricultural production, such as agricultural tool repair and fertilizer factories, and vigorously carrying out technological innovation to improve labor productivity, the remaining factories that have little relationship with current agricultural production and can be run more during the agricultural slack season and suspended during the busy season, such as brick and tile factories and clothing factories, are temporarily suspended; the labor force, livestock, and vehicles engaged in sideline production are transferred to field production as much as possible; the service personnel not directly engaged in agricultural production are also adjusted, and some strong laborers are transferred to the front line of agriculture. After taking these measures, more than 1,200 laborers were released. At present, the labor force engaged in field production has reached 82% of the commune's total labor force.
    After a large number of laborers were invested in the agricultural front, the production teams made proper arrangements for this new force, which was uniformly deployed by the production teams, thus greatly accelerating the harvesting progress. The entire commune rapidly increased from harvesting 700 mu per day to more than 1,500 mu. By the 14th, the summer crops of 13 of the 31 production teams in this commune had been harvested. At the same time, due to the increase in labor force, the production teams also adopted the method of harvesting, plowing stubble, and replanting simultaneously. At present, more than 1,800 mu of land has been plowed, and more than 1,600 mu of autumn vegetables have been replanted.

    Xinhua News Agency - According to the Zhejiang Daily: The Zhuji County Party Committee helped communes, brigades, and production teams transfer as much labor as possible from all walks of life for the current grain production. The entire county is thinking about surpassing early rice with late rice, and planning everything for surpassing the annual plan. More than 70% of Party members, League members, and leading backbone forces have been concentrated on agricultural production, and more than 80% of the labor force has been mobilized for late rice field management. Because of the concentrated leadership and labor force, agricultural production is getting better and better. More than 160,000 mu of the county's more than 500,000 mu of late rice have completed the first weeding, and more than 130,000 mu have been top-dressed once.
    In order to grasp agriculture in a down-to-earth manner, the Zhuji County Party Committee seriously summarized the basic experience of late rice management of the Qiyi Production Team in Fengqiao Commune in early August. The Party branch of this production team, on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses, proposed the slogan of early top-dressing, early weeding, and striving for late rice to surpass early rice. Seven of the eight Party branch secretaries and deputy secretaries and captains went to the teams to strengthen specific leadership, concentrating 85% of the labor force to field management. After taking these measures, the entire team completed the first weeding by August 11, accumulated and composted more than 4,000 dan of fertilizer, and applied an average of 5 dan of standard fertilizer per mu of late rice. Because the field management work was grasped early, the late rice returned to green and grew early. More than 900 mu of the team's 1,020 mu of late rice have already turned green and grown.
    The County Party Committee promptly promoted the experience of the Qiyi Production Team, and conducted in-depth ideological education on strengthening the agricultural front, especially the grain production front, among cadres and the masses.
    On the basis of ideological mobilization, the County Party Committee first determined that the original personnel for summer harvesting and summer planting would be put into field management, and adjusted the leadership to send 22 County Party Committee members to strengthen specific leadership in communes and production teams. More than 80% of the cadres in communes and brigades also went to production teams and small teams to help with work. Of the county's more than 5,400 main backbone members of production teams, more than 4,100 went to small teams. The communes also drew more than 3,000 people from commune-run industries to strengthen the main attack line of agriculture, based on the principle of running more during the agricultural slack season and less during the busy season. Of the county's original more than 29,000 logistics personnel, more than 11,000 were drawn to small teams to participate in grain production through rational adjustment and innovation of cooking utensils and improvement of work efficiency. In addition, all localities have also universally mobilized auxiliary labor and arranged appropriate work according to their expertise and physical strength. In this way, the number of people participating in field management in the county increased by more than 29,000. After the labor force was concentrated, the county formed more than 4,800 fertilizer accumulation groups, more than 900 irrigation groups, and more than 1,200 pest control professional teams to comprehensively strengthen field cultivation and management. For example, after the leadership and labor force of the Youyi Production Team of Fengqiao Commune were concentrated, the responsibilities were implemented to the small teams and groups, and the indicators were assigned to the fields, implementing the method of assigning people, assigning fields, assigning tasks, assigning work points, and assigning rewards, and the fertilizer accumulation work efficiency increased from 700 jin per person per day to 1,000 jin. The daily progress of weeding, fertilizing, and pest control in the county reached more than 70,000 mu. Weeding was done early, carefully, and meticulously, fertilizing was done as it was accumulated and applied, and at the same time as weeding, seedlings were replenished and supported in an all-round way to ensure that the seedlings were complete and vigorous.

### 紧紧抓住农时迅速加强粮食生产战线  后子河公社增调千余劳力到田间  诸暨县推广齐一生产队经验，全县集中80％劳力管好晚稻

    紧紧抓住农时迅速加强粮食生产战线
    后子河公社增调千余劳力到田间
    诸暨县推广齐一生产队经验，全县集中80％劳力管好晚稻
    本报西宁19日电　青海省西宁市郊区后子河公社全面合理安排劳力，加强农业战线。最近，公社根据社办工业、副业等在农闲多办，农忙少办的原则，从社办工业以及副业和食堂等服务事业方面共抽出一千二百多人加强农业生产第一线，使全社投入农业的劳动力达到全部劳力的82％，有力地加强了当前的田间生产。
    后子河公社共有三十一个生产队，一万零八百八十九个劳动力。在这以前，全社投入农业生产的劳力七千九百四十多人，占总劳力的73％；社办企业有五百人，占总劳力的4.6％；副业生产有五百人，占4.6％；生活福利事业一千二百一十九人，占11.2％；牲畜饲养七百一十八人，占6.6％。非直接参加农业的劳动力共占总劳力的27％。这个比例，在往年或农闲季节还是比较合适的，但是今年，后子河公社为了加快发展粮食生产，大量开垦荒地，播种面积比去年扩大了五万多亩，其中仅粮食作物就扩大了二万九千多亩。按去年平均每个劳动力担负的粮食作物面积计算，需要增加五千八百个劳动力，而当前一方面要抢收夏田，另方面还要加强早田后期田间管理和晚田的田间管理，以及为明年生产作准备等，因此，增加农业劳力就十分需要。
    如何解决这个问题？公社党委经过分析研究，认为除了大搞工具改革，提高劳动生产率以外，必须从社办工业等方面挖掘劳动潜力，充实与加强农业战线。党委把这个问题交给了干部和群众讨论，并向社员讲农业形势，摆劳力使用情况，统一了思想认识，然后对全社劳动力进行了全面调整和安排。对社办工业，除农具修配、化肥等直接为农业生产服务的工厂保证正常生产，并且大闹技术革新，提高劳动生产率外，其余与当前农业生产关系不大，农闲时可以多办、农忙时可以停办的工厂，如砖瓦厂、被服厂等暂时停办；把从事副业生产的劳动力、牲畜、车辆尽可能调出来用于田间生产；对非直接参加农业生产的服务人员，也作了调整，把一些强劳动力调到农业第一线。采取了这些措施以后，共腾出劳动力一千二百多人。目前，投入田间生产的劳动力已占到全社劳动力总数的82％。
    大批劳动力投入农业战线以后，各生产队对这批新的生力军进行了妥善安排，由生产队统一调配，因此，大大加快了收割进度。全公社由原来每天收割七百亩，迅速增加到一千五百多亩。到14日，这个公社三十一个生产队中已有十三个队的夏田作物收割完毕。同时，由于劳力增多，各生产队还采取了边收割、边翻槎、边复种的办法，目前，已翻槎地一千八百多亩，复种秋菜一千六百多亩。
    本报讯　据浙江日报消息：中共诸暨县委帮助公社、大队、生产队与各行各业调出尽可能多的劳力，用于当前的粮食生产。全县人人为晚稻超早稻着想，事事为全年超计划打算，已有70％以上的党团员与领导骨干集中到农业生产方面来，并调集了80％以上的劳力投入晚稻田间管理。由于领导集中、劳力集中，农业生产搞得越来越好。全县五十多万亩晚稻中已有十六万多亩完成头遍耘田，十三万多亩施追肥一次。
    为了踏踏实实地进一步抓好农业，中共诸暨县委于8月上旬在枫桥公社齐一生产队认真总结了这个队晚稻管理的基本经验。这个生产队的党支部在充分发动群众的基础上，提出了早追肥、早耘田，力争晚稻超早稻的口号，党支部正副书记与队长八人，有七人到小队加强具体领导，集中了85％的劳力转到田间管理方面来。采取这些措施以后，全队到8月11日就耘完了头遍田，积肥、沤肥四千多担，每亩晚稻平均追施标准肥五担。因为田间管理工作抓得早，晚稻返青发棵也早，全队一千零二十多亩晚稻已经有九百多亩转青发棵。
    县委及时推广了齐一生产队的经验，并且在干部和群众中深入地进行大力加强农业战线、特别是粮食生产战线的思想教育。
    在思想发动的基础上，县委首先确定夏收夏种的原班人马投入田间管理，并且调整领导力量，派出了二十二个县委委员，分别到公社、生产队加强具体领导。公社、大队也有80％以上的干部到生产队和小队帮助工作。全县五千四百多名生产队主要骨干，也有四千一百余名下到小队。各公社还根据农闲多办、农忙少办的原则，从社办工业中抽调了三千多人加强农业主攻战线。全县原有二万九千多名后勤人员，采取合理调整以及革新炊具、提高工效等办法，抽出一万一千多人到小队参加粮食生产。此外，各地还把辅助劳力普遍动员起来，根据他们的专长和体力情况安排了适当的工作。这样，全县参加田间管理的人员就增加了二万九千多人。劳力集中以后，全县共组成了四千八百多个积肥小组、九百多个灌水小组和一千二百多个治虫专业队，全面加强田间培育管理。如枫桥公社友谊生产队领导、劳力集中后，把责任落实到小队、小组，指标到丘，实行定人、定田、定任务、定工分、定奖励的办法，积肥工效从每人每天七百斤提高到一千斤。全县耘田、施肥、除虫日进度达到七万余亩。耘田做到了早耘、细耘、精耘，施肥做到了随积随施，并且在耘田的同时，全面地进行了补苗、扶苗、保证苗全苗旺。（附图片）
