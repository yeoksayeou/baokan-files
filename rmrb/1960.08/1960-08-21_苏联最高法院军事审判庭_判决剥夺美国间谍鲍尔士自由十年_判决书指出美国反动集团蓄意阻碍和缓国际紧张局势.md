Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 20th - TASS reports from Moscow on the 19th: The Military Collegium of the Soviet Supreme Court concluded its trial of American spy pilot Powers on the 19th.

The President of the Military Collegium of the Soviet Supreme Court, Lieutenant General of Justice Borisoglebsky, read out the verdict on the criminal case of Powers.

The court held that, in view of Powers' crime under Article 2 of the Soviet "Law on Criminal Responsibility for State Crimes," it sentenced him to ten years of deprivation of liberty, with the first three years to be served in prison.

This judgment is final and not subject to appeal.

The announcement of the verdict was met with great satisfaction by those present. A storm of applause rang out in the hall.

The trial by the Military Collegium of the Soviet Supreme Court is now concluded.

Xinhua News Agency, August 20th - TASS, Moscow: The verdict in the case of American Central Intelligence Agency ("10-10" Special Reconnaissance Detachment) pilot Powers, read out on the 19th by the Military Collegium of the Soviet Supreme Court, stated:

According to the materials of the case examined at the trial, the malicious nature of Powers' flight deep into Soviet territory has been established.

The judgment said that the malicious nature of this flight, which harbors extremely serious consequences for universal peace in the age of thermonuclear weapons, has become completely apparent.

The judgment emphasized that after examining the wreckage of the downed aircraft, it was determined that it was an American-made aircraft specifically designed for high-altitude flight in order to perform espionage reconnaissance missions.

Therefore, pilot Powers was arrested and criminally prosecuted for espionage activities against the Soviet Union.

The judgment said that at the trial, the defendant Powers detailed his espionage activities and all the circumstances related to his intrusion into Soviet airspace on May 1, 1960.

The trial determined that in April 1956, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency hired Powers to fly high-altitude aircraft to complete special reconnaissance missions.

The trial determined that the "10-10" detachment was a specialized joint organization of American military and non-military reconnaissance activities, whose mission was to conduct espionage against the Soviet Union by sending reconnaissance aircraft to intrude into Soviet airspace.

The judgment said that from 1956, Powers, on the orders of the commander of the "10-10" detachment, frequently conducted espionage flights along the Soviet borders with Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan.

According to the materials of the case and the confession of the defendant Powers, the criminal flight of Powers into Soviet airspace on May 1, 1960, was prepared long in advance.

When intruding into Soviet territory, Powers was to turn on aerial cameras and specialized devices for measuring the work of Soviet air defense radio positioning stations at certain locations.

Powers was instructed to pay special attention to two locations, one of which was suspected by American intelligence agencies of having a rocket launch site, and the other was suspected of being the location of a particularly important defense target.

The judgment emphasized that the physical evidence of the defendant in the case file confirmed that Powers carried out the criminal mission given to him.

The judgment said that, according to the developed aerial photographic film, the defendant Powers photographed Soviet industrial and military targets from the "U-2" aircraft.

Powers recorded the pulses of certain Soviet radio positioning stations on magnetic tape, with the aim of discovering the Soviet air defense system.

The judgment said that, according to expert appraisals, the intelligence collected by the defendant Powers during his flight in Soviet airspace on May 1, 1960, was a state and military secret of the Soviet Union, which is specially protected by law.

The trial fully affirmed that the "U-2" reconnaissance aircraft, manufactured by the American "Lockheed" company, belonged to the U.S. Air Force, and that the defendant Powers was a secret agent of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.

The judgment said that Powers was a docile executor of the perfidious scheme realized by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency with the consent of the U.S. government.

According to Powers' own confession, he was aware that he was intruding into Soviet airspace, violating Soviet national sovereignty, and conducting flights with espionage purposes in Soviet airspace, the main task of which was to discover and record rocket launch sites.

The judgment said that now, certain countries possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons have the possibility of rapidly delivering such weapons to their targets. Under such advanced military technology, a military offensive may directly follow a military reconnaissance aircraft flying into Soviet airspace. American generals have announced that the United States frequently sends patrol bombers with hydrogen bombs flying in the air, ready to drop bombs on pre-determined Soviet targets at any time. Under such circumstances, the danger mentioned above becomes even more real.

Under such circumstances, the aggressive act of the United States carried out by the defendant Powers on May 1 this year created a threat to universal peace.

The judgment said that according to the materials possessed by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court, there can be no doubt that the defendant Powers' intrusion into Soviet airspace in a reconnaissance plane was carrying out a far-reaching scheme by American reactionary ruling groups aimed at intensifying the international situation.

Later events proved that the May 1 intrusion into Soviet airspace by the "U-2" reconnaissance plane was deliberately planned by American reactionary groups, with the aim of sabotaging the Paris summit meeting, obstructing the easing of international tensions, and reviving the declining "Cold War" policy hated by people of all countries.

The judgment said that the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union has determined that it would not have been possible for Powers to carry out his espionage mission if the United States had not used military bases and airfields on the territories of neighboring countries of the Soviet Union, including Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and Norway, for aggressive purposes.

The Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union determined that the defendant Powers had been an active secret agent of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for a long time, directly carrying out espionage missions against the Soviet Union by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.

The Military Collegium also determined that Powers, with the knowledge of the U.S. government, intruded into Soviet airspace on May 1, 1960, driving a "U-2" military reconnaissance aircraft with special equipment, and collected strategic intelligence constituting Soviet state and military secrets using special radio technology equipment and photographic equipment.

Thus, he committed the serious crime specified in Article 2 of the Soviet "Law on Criminal Responsibility for State Crimes."

Regarding the various circumstances of the case, "evaluated according to the conviction that they are interconnected, and taking into account Powers' frank confession of his guilt and his sincere remorse for what he has done," the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, "proceeding from the principles of socialist humanism," sentenced Powers to ten years of deprivation of liberty, with the first three years to be served in prison.

The offender's term of service (including the pre-trial detention period) shall be counted from May 1, 1960.

The judgment is final and not subject to appeal or objection.

    苏联最高法院军事审判庭
    判决剥夺美国间谍鲍尔士自由十年
    判决书指出美国反动集团蓄意阻碍和缓国际紧张局势
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：苏联最高法院军事审判庭在19日结束了对于美国间谍飞行员鲍尔士的审讯。
    苏联最高法院军事审判庭庭长，司法中将鲍里索格列勃斯基宣读了对鲍尔士刑事案件的判决书。
    法院认为，鉴于鲍尔士犯了苏联“关于国事罪刑事责任”法律的第二条的罪行，因此判决剥夺他自由十年，其中头三年监禁。
    这一判决是最后判决，不得上诉。
    判决书的宣布使在场的人感到极大的满意。在大厅里响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    苏联最高法院军事审判庭的这次审讯到此结束。
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高法院军事审判庭19日宣读的对美国中央情报局“10—10”特别侦察分队飞行员鲍尔士案件的判决书中说：
    根据审判会上所审理的该案的材料，确定了鲍尔士深入苏联领土的飞行的恶意性质。
    判决书说，蕴藏着在热核武器时代对普遍和平有极严重后果的这次飞行的恶意性质已经完全明显。
    判决书强调指出，检查被击落的飞机的残骸后确定，被击落的是一架美国造的飞机，它的结构专门用来进行高空飞行，以便履行间谍侦察任务。
    因此，飞行员鲍尔士已被逮捕，并且根据对苏联进行间谍活动的罪名对他进行刑事起诉。
    判决书说，在审判会上，被告鲍尔士详细地供认了他的间谍活动和同1960年5月1日侵入苏联领空有关的一切情节。
    审判确定，1956年4月，美国中央情报局雇用鲍尔士驾驶高空飞机去完成特殊的侦察任务。
    审判确定，“10—10”分队是美国军事和非军事侦察活动的专门联合组织，它的任务是通过派遣侦察飞机侵入苏联领空的办法对苏联进行间谍活动。
    判决书说，从1956年起，鲍尔士奉“10—10”分队的司令官的命令，经常沿着苏联同土耳其、伊朗和阿富汗的边境线进行间谍飞行。
    根据本案的材料和被告鲍尔士的供词确定，鲍尔士1960年5月1日侵入苏联领空的犯罪飞行是早就经过周密准备的。
    在侵入苏联领土时，鲍尔士要在某些地点开启空中摄影机和测定苏联防空无线电测位站工作的专门装置。
    鲍尔士被指示要特别注意两个地点，其中一个地点，美国侦察机关推测有火箭发射场，而另一个地点推测是特别重要的国防目标的所在地。
    判决书强调指出，本案档案内的被告物证确定，鲍尔士执行了给予他的犯罪任务。
    判决书说，根据保留下来的空中摄影胶片的显影辨明，被告鲍尔士从“U—2型”飞机上拍摄了苏联的工业和军事目标。
    鲍尔士在磁带上录下了苏联某些无线电测位站的脉冲，其目的是想发现苏联防空系统。
    判决书说，据专家鉴定，被告鲍尔士1960年5月1日在苏联领空飞行时所收集的情报是苏联国家的和军事的秘密，它是受法律特别保护的。
    审判会完全肯定，这架美国“洛克希德”公司制造的“U—2型”侦察飞机是属于美国空军的，而被告鲍尔士是美国中央情报局的秘密谍报员。
    判决书说，鲍尔士是美国中央情报局在美国政府的同意下实现的背信弃义的图谋的驯服的执行人。
    据鲍尔士本人的供认，他已经意识到，他侵入苏联领空，破坏了苏联国家主权，在苏联领空上进行抱着间谍目的的飞行，这种飞行的主要任务是发现和记录火箭发射场。
    判决书说，现在，某些拥有原子武器和氢武器的国家，有可能迅速地把这种武器送到目标，在军事技术这样发达的条件下，在军用侦察飞机到苏联上空的飞行后可能直接发生军事进攻。美国将军们曾经宣布，美国经常派遣巡逻轰炸机带着氢弹在空中飞行，随时准备向预定的苏联目标扔炸弹，在这种环境下，上面说的危险就更加现实了。
    在这样的情况下，今年5月1日由被告鲍尔士执行的美国的侵略行为，造成了对普遍和平的威胁。
    判决书说，根据最高法院军事审判庭掌握的材料，可以毫不怀疑，被告鲍尔士驾驶侦察机入侵苏联领空，是执行了美国反动统治集团的旨在加紧国际局势的目的深远的图谋。
    后来的事件证明，“U—2型”侦察飞机5月1日侵入苏联领空，是美国反动集团蓄意策划的，其目的是破坏巴黎最高级会议、阻碍和缓国际紧张局势、复活衰朽的、各国人民所憎恨的“冷战”政策。
    判决书说，苏联最高法院军事审判庭确定，如果美国不利用苏联的邻国，其中包括土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦和挪威领土上的军事基地和机场进行侵略目的的话，鲍尔士执行间谍任务是不可能的。
    苏联最高法院军事审判庭确定，被告鲍尔士很长时期以来就是美国中央情报局的一名积极的秘密谍报员，直接执行美国中央情报局对苏联进行的间谍任务。
    军事审判庭还确定，鲍尔士于1960年5月1日在美国政府知道的情况下，驾驶有专门装置的“U—2型”军用侦察飞机入侵苏联领空，并用特殊的无线电技术装置和摄影装置搜集构成苏联国家和军事秘密的战略情报。
    这样，他就犯了苏联“关于国事罪刑事责任”法律第二条载明的重罪。
    对该案的各种情节“根据对其有互相联系的信念加以估价，并考虑到鲍尔士对他的罪过直供不讳和他真诚地对所作的事有所悔过”，苏联最高法院军事审判庭“从社会主义人道主义原则出发”，判决鲍尔士剥夺自由十年，头三年予以监禁。
    罪犯的服刑期（预先羁押期计算在内）从1960年5月1日算起。
    判决是最后判决，不得上诉和表示异议。
