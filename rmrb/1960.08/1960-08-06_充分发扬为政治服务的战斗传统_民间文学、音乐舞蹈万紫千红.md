Xinhua News Agency report: China's folk literature is developing rapidly on the path of socialist literature and art, along the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving socialism.

The large-scale emergence of new folk songs is a prominent feature of the development of folk literature in our country. Thanks to the advocacy of the Party, a massive folk song collection movement has been launched nationwide since the Great Leap Forward, and the new folk song creation movement has developed extensively, resulting in a large number of worker-peasant-soldier poets and singers. They are not only skilled in production and combat but also vanguards of literature and art. These poets and singers, with heroic feelings and passionate pens, enthusiastically sing the praises of new life, new things, and new heroes. According to incomplete statistics, in the two years of 1958 and 1959 alone, more than 1,300 kinds of new folk songs have been published by the central government and provinces, cities, and autonomous regions.

Since the beginning of this year, in the upsurge of vigorously promoting the technical revolution, the cultural revolution, vigorously running urban people's communes, and studying Chairman Mao's works, the new folk song movement has shown even greater development, greater popularization, and greater improvement. New folk song creation activities have also been carried out in urban neighborhoods. Poetry contests have been further developed, and long narrative folk songs collectively created by workers and peasants have begun to appear. In the mass creation movement with new folk songs as the main content, new folk operas, new folk tales, and new proverbs with national and folk characteristics have also emerged.

At present, more than a dozen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country have organized investigation and collection teams in collaboration with professional institutions and relevant units, combining experts with the masses, to carry out folk literature and art census and collection work, collecting and sorting out a large number of works and materials, and training a group of folk literature teams.

On the basis of large-scale investigation and collection, the country has begun planned and systematic compilation work. In the past two years alone, more than 1,700 kinds of folk literature works have been published nationwide, which is 27 times that of the two years of 1949 and 1950.

Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: China's socialist new music, characterized by revolutionary content and national form, is developing towards increasing maturity.

The revolutionary music of our country, led by the Communist Party of China and founded by Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, has had a glorious fighting tradition of serving proletarian politics and serving the working people from the very beginning. In every historical period, music has become a bugle call to encourage the people to engage in revolutionary struggles. Since the founding of New China, this tradition has undergone new and major developments. Strong revolutionary and contemporary spirit constitute the most basic characteristics of Chinese musical works. From "The Hearts of People All Over the World Are United as One," "Ode to the Motherland," "The Battle Hymn of the Chinese People's Volunteers," and "The Sino-Soviet Friendship Song" to "Socialism is Good," "The Great Leap Forward Song Shakes the Mountains and Rivers," and "The People's Commune is Good," these songs concentrate and summarize the fighting political sentiments of the masses in various periods.

The literary and art orientation of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and the political requirement of expressing revolutionary struggles have encouraged musicians to continuously explore and use national forms that are popular with the masses in their creations. On the one hand, they inherit and innovate on the traditional national musical forms of our country, so that they can better adapt to the needs of expressing modern themes; on the other hand, they strive to make foreign musical forms (such as symphonies, operas, etc.) develop in the direction of nationalization, forming a Chinese style and Chinese spirit. In these areas, some gratifying gains have already been seen. The diversity and rich expressiveness of Chinese national traditional musical forms help composers break through their old creative formats and performance techniques. Many composers have processed and adapted recorded folk songs or folk instrumental music. Musicians have also made many successful creations in the process of developing foreign musical forms in the direction of nationalization. The "Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto," which is already familiar to people, provides a good start for the nationalization and popularization of symphonic music; the symphonic poem "Mu Guiying Takes Command," written by the Central Orchestra using Beijing opera tunes, also has a very novel style.

Precisely because our music has revolutionary content and national forms and has close ties with realistic struggles and the working masses, it is universally welcomed by the people. The people not only want to appreciate music, but also demand to reflect their lives through musical creation and performance activities. Since the Great Leap Forward, the mass music activities carried out throughout the country have presented a thriving scene. Cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Anshan, and Dalian have held singing campaigns with tens of thousands of people participating. In mass music activities, a large number of music backbones and activists who have mastered certain singing skills, performance skills, and creation and conducting techniques have also emerged. The phenomenon of self-composition, self-performance, self-writing, and self-singing is very common. The development of the mass music movement is of inestimable significance. It means that a new era of people creating music culture and people enjoying music culture has begun in the history of music in our country, and the music culture of our country is moving towards a situation of great popularization and great improvement.

Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: The dance art of New China has inherited and carried forward the fighting tradition of revolutionary literature and art in our country, and a large number of excellent dances and dance dramas reflecting the revolutionary struggles of our people and the socialist Great Leap Forward have emerged.

The themes of revolutionary armed struggles carried out by all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Communist Party of China are extremely common in dance dramas. "Five Red Clouds," which reflects the struggle of the Li people in Hainan against the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, "Eighteen Warriors," which praises the heroic deeds of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army during the Long March, and "Butterfly Loves Flowers," which is based on Chairman Mao's poems, vividly express the revolutionary will and heroic spirit of our people who are resourceful, brave, not afraid of difficulties and obstacles, and not afraid of sacrifice.

Since the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the movement of people's communes, song and dance art performance groups have gone up to the mountains and down to the countryside, creating and performing many dance programs with contemporary characteristics and a high degree of ideological and combat effectiveness, which have powerfully cooperated with the socialist construction cause of our country. For example, "Celebrating the Steel Production of Wuhan Iron and Steel," which expresses the heroic spirit of the working class in the era of the Great Leap Forward, "Iron and Steel Flowing," which reflects the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, and "The People's Commune is Good," which praises the people's communes and the great agricultural harvest, reflect the heroic era of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country from various aspects, and sing the praises of the three red flags of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune.

During this period, mass amateur dance creation also showed a new situation of great popularization and great prosperity. Works such as "People's Commune Flowers Bloom," "Corn Acceptance," and "Hui Women Lock the Dragon," created by peasants, and "Morning of the East China Sea" and "Night of the Reservoir," created by soldiers, fully express their love for the motherland, love for labor, and love for the cause of socialist construction. At the National Staff and Workers' Literary and Art Performance Conference held in May this year, the programs performed by the staff and workers, such as "Steel Red Flag Class," "Heroic Miners," "Clever Girls," and "Lumberjack Dance," cleverly refined the bold, robust, and beautiful typical movements in production labor, giving the audience great encouragement.

In the recent propaganda activities against American imperialist aggression, resolutely liberating Taiwan, and defending world peace, professional and amateur literary and art workers in various places have fully used the literary and artistic weapon of dance, performing dance dramas and song and dance news reports with the theme of opposing American imperialism, such as "The Adventures of Thief Ai" and "The Struggle of the People of Taiwan."

The revolutionary struggle themes expressed by the art of dance almost touch on every aspect of the history of the revolutionary struggle and modern life of the Chinese people in the past century, fully reflecting the revolutionary spirit of the times. The large-scale dance drama "The Small Sword Society," recently performed by the Shanghai Experimental Opera House Song and Dance Troupe, is an epic praising the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle of the people of Shanghai a hundred years ago.

The graduating students of the Acting and Stage Art Departments of the Shanghai Theatre Academy went to the Fujian Front to give graduation performances before graduation, allowing the People's Liberation Army relatives on the front line to assess their achievements. In the consolation performances, they were not afraid of wind and rain, climbing mountains and wading through water, and running around to perform late at night. In more than seventy days, they performed a total of six hundred and thirty-two performances. This is the students performing "Three Cups of Fine Wine to the Dear Ones" for the soldiers on the Fujian Front. (Xinhua News Agency manuscript)

    充分发扬为政治服务的战斗传统
    民间文学、音乐舞蹈万紫千红
    据新华社讯　我国的民间文学事业，沿着为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的方向，在社会主义文艺道路上飞速发展。
    新民歌的大量涌现，是我国民间文学发展中的突出特点。由于党的倡导，大跃进以来，全国展开了一个声势浩大的采风运动，新民歌创作运动普遍发展起来，出现了大批工农兵诗人和歌手。他们既是生产、战斗的能手，又是文艺的尖兵。这些诗人和歌手，以豪迈的心情，热情的笔调，热烈歌颂新生活、新事物、新英雄。据不完全统计，在1958年和1959年两年中，仅中央和省、市、自治区，已出版了新民歌一千三百多种。
    今年以来，在大闹技术革命、文化革命、大办城市人民公社和学习毛主席著作的高潮中，新民歌运动更出现了大发展、大普及、大提高的局面。城市里弄也开展了新民歌创作活动。赛诗会活动有了新的发展，开始出现了工农群众集体创作的长篇叙事民歌。在以新民歌为主要内容的群众创作运动中，还出现了具有民族民间特色的新民间戏曲、新民间故事和新谚语等。
    目前，全国已有十多个省、市、自治区由专业机构与有关单位协作，专家与群众结合，组织调查采录队，开展民间文艺普查和采录工作，搜集和整理出大批作品和资料，锻炼了一批民间文学队伍。
    在大规模进行调查采录的基础上，全国开始了有计划有系统的编选工作。仅最近两年全国出版的民间文学作品，就有一千七百多种，等于1949年和1950年两年的二十七倍。
    据新华社5日讯　以革命内容和民族形式为特色的我国社会主义新音乐正在日趋成熟地发展着。
    在中国共产党领导下的、由聂耳和冼星海奠基的我国革命音乐，一开始就具有为无产阶级政治服务、为劳动人民服务的光荣的战斗传统。在各个历史时期中，音乐都成为鼓舞人民从事革命斗争的号角。新中国成立以后，这个传统有着新的重大的发展。强烈的革命性和时代精神，构成了我国音乐作品最基本的特征。从“全世界人民心一条”、“歌唱祖国”、“中国人民志愿军战歌”、“中苏友好歌”一直到“社会主义好”、“大跃进歌声震山河”、“人民公社好”，这些歌曲集中概括了各个时期人民群众战斗的政治感情。
    为工农兵服务的文艺方向和表现革命斗争的政治要求，鼓舞着音乐家在创作中不断地努力去探索和运用为群众所喜闻乐见的民族形式。他们一方面对我国传统的民族音乐形式加以继承和革新，使其更好地适应于表现现代题材的需要；另一方面又力求使外来的音乐形式（如交响乐、歌剧等）向民族化方向发展，形成中国作风与中国气派。在这些方面，已经看到了一些可喜的收获。我国民族传统音乐表现形式的多样性及其丰富的表现力，帮助作曲家们突破了自己的旧的创作格式和表现手法。很多作曲家都对记录下来的民间歌曲或民间器乐曲进行了加工和改编。音乐家在使外来的音乐形式向民族化的方向发展过程中，也有着许多成功的创造。已经为人们所熟悉的“梁祝小提琴协奏曲”为交响音乐的民族化和群众化提供了一个良好的开端；中央乐团用京戏的曲调写作的交响诗“穆桂英挂帅”，也具有非常新颖的风格。
    正由于我国音乐具有革命的内容和民族的形式，同现实斗争和工农群众有着密切的联系，因此受到人民的普遍欢迎。人民群众不仅要欣赏音乐，更要求通过音乐的创作和表演活动来反映自己的生活。大跃进以来，全国各地开展起来的群众音乐活动呈现一片蓬蓬勃勃的景象。上海、天津、沈阳、鞍山、旅大等城市都曾举行过数以万计的群众参加的歌唱运动。在群众音乐活动中，还涌现出成批的掌握了一定的歌唱艺术、演奏艺术和创作、指挥技巧的音乐骨干和音乐积极分子。自编、自演、自写、自唱的现象非常普遍。群众音乐运动的开展有着不可估量的意义，它意味着在我国的音乐史上已经开始了一个人民创造音乐文化、人民享受音乐文化的新纪元，我国的音乐文化正在走向大普及大提高的局面。
    据新华社5日讯　新中国的舞蹈艺术继承和发扬了我国革命文艺的战斗传统，涌现了许多反映我国人民革命斗争和社会主义大跃进的优秀舞蹈和舞剧。
    各族人民在中国共产党领导下进行革命武装斗争的题材，在舞剧中出现得极为普遍。反映海南黎族人民反抗国民党反动统治斗争的“五朵红云”，歌颂长征途中中国工农红军英勇事迹的“十八勇士”，根据毛主席诗词创作的“蝶恋花”等舞剧，生动地表现了我国人民机智勇敢、不畏艰难险阻、不惜牺牲的革命意志和英雄气概。
    全国工农业生产大跃进和人民公社化运动以来，歌舞艺术表演团体上山下乡，创作和演出了许多具有时代特点和高度思想性、战斗性的舞蹈节目，有力地配合了我国的社会主义建设事业。如表现大跃进时代工人阶级英雄气概的“庆祝武钢出钢”、“铁水奔流”，反映技术革新和技术革命运动的“新车与旧车”，歌颂人民公社和农业大丰收的“人民公社好”等，从各个方面反映了我国工农业生产大跃进的英雄时代，歌颂了党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗。
    在这期间，群众业余舞蹈创作也出现了大普及、大繁荣的新局面。农民们创作的“人民公社鲜花开”、“玉米验收”、“惠女锁蛟龙”，战士们创作的“东海的早晨”、“水库的夜晚”等作品，充分表达了他们热爱祖国、热爱劳动、热爱社会主义建设事业的思想感情。在今年5月间举行的全国职工文艺会演大会上，职工们演出的“钢铁红旗班”、“英雄矿工”、“巧姑娘”、“伐木工人舞”等节目，巧妙地提炼了生产劳动中豪迈健壮而又优美的典型动作，给予观众巨大的鼓舞。
    在最近反对美帝国主义侵略、坚决解放台湾、保卫世界和平的宣传活动中，各地专业和业余的文艺工作者，充分运用了舞蹈这个文艺武器，演出了“艾贼旅行记”、“台湾人民的斗争”等以反对美帝国主义为主题的舞剧和歌舞活报剧。
    用舞蹈艺术表现的革命斗争题材，几乎接触到近百年来我国人民革命斗争历史和现代生活的每个方面，充分体现了革命的时代精神。上海实验歌剧院歌舞团最近演出的大型舞剧“小刀会”，就是一首歌颂一百年前上海人民反帝反封建斗争的壮烈史诗。（附图片）
    上海戏剧学院表演、舞台美术两系应届毕业生，在毕业前夕到福建前线去作毕业演出，让前线的解放军亲人来考核自己的成绩。在慰问演出中，他们不怕风吹雨打，爬山涉水，深更半夜到处奔走演出。在七十多天中，他们共演出了六百三十二场次。这是学生们为福建前线的战士们演出“三杯美酒敬亲人”。　　（新华社稿）
