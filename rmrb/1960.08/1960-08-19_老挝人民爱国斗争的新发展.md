New Developments in the Lao People's Patriotic Struggle
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

On the morning of August 9th, the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le, commander of the Second Paratroop Battalion of the Kingdom of Laos, launched a coup and took control of the capital, Vientiane. The Lao National Assembly unanimously decided to no longer recognize the Phoui Sananikone government. Under the authorization of the King of Laos, Prince Souvanna Phouma has officially formed a new government of the Kingdom of Laos, and announced that the new government's domestic policy is mainly to restore peace and tranquility throughout the country, stop the mutual slaughter among the Lao people, and implement national harmony; its foreign policy is mainly to implement genuine neutrality; respect all agreements, including the Geneva Accords; and accept assistance from all countries without any military, political, or economic conditions attached, etc. This new development in the Lao political situation reflects the strong desire of the Lao people to achieve domestic peace, safeguard national independence, and implement a policy of peace and neutrality, and it deserves the attention of all countries and people who care about peace in Laos and Indochina.

Originally, the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Indochina issue, as well as the Vientiane Agreement reached in November 1957 between the Souvanna Phouma government of the Kingdom of Laos and the former Pathet Lao fighting forces based on this agreement, clearly stipulated the path of peace, independence, democratic unity, and neutrality for Laos. According to these two agreements, Laos once achieved peaceful unification. However, U.S. imperialism deliberately tried to turn Laos into its colony and military base, and in many ways instigated the government of the Kingdom of Laos to violate the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements. In recent years, U.S. imperialism has used "U.S. aid" and dispatched a large number of military personnel to control the army of the Kingdom of Laos, and has supported the extremely pro-American Phoumi Nosavan clique. This clique has implemented a traitorous policy of relying on U.S. imperialism, causing Laos to gradually lose its independent status. U.S. imperialism has even more vigorously promoted the sinister policy of "using Lao people to fight Lao people," instigating the pro-American traitorous clique in Laos to provoke a civil war in Laos and undermine the peace of Laos. At the end of last year, U.S. imperialism instigated the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," an extremely pro-American traitorous clique in Laos, to launch a military coup, and recently directed the ugly farce of "elections" in Laos, establishing a Phoui Sananikone government that was actually under the direct control of this traitorous clique. At the same time, U.S. imperialism has also tried every possible means to conspire to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Under these circumstances, the situation in Laos has further deteriorated. The civil war in Laos has expanded, and more and more Lao patriotic people have been brutally killed and thrown into prison, and the territory of Laos has been ravaged by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. As the Lao Coup Committee revealed in its proclamation to the people, "American interference in our country is deepening day by day. There are permanent Americans everywhere"; the pro-American traitorous regime in Laos "has brought our country to the brink of decline, killing people for no reason, arresting and imprisoning Lao patriots in order to exchange them for U.S. aid, and serving their personal interests"; "the army command has also ordered the army to suppress and persecute peace-loving compatriots, and burn down their houses and granaries..."

All these cruel facts have profoundly educated the Lao people. After struggling for half a century to gain independence and freedom, can the Lao people, who have broken free from French colonial rule, tolerate U.S. imperialism putting the colonial shackles back on their necks? The coup launched by Lao patriotic officers and soldiers with the support of the people to overthrow the traitorous government is a powerful response by the Lao people to the American aggressors.

What do the broad masses of the Lao people want? In its various communiques and statements, the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le announced that the new policy of the Kingdom of Laos should be: to stop the civil war and restore domestic peace; "to eliminate the evils of bribery," "to respect the democratic system, and to respect human rights"; and in foreign affairs, to demand "the immediate abolition of foreign military bases in Laos, and to oppose foreign interference," "to drive foreign troops out of Laos," "on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence," "to implement a policy of neutrality, and actively 'establish friendly relations and good neighborly relations' with countries that are willing to establish good relations with Laos." On the day that Prince Souvanna Phouma was appointed as the new Prime Minister of Laos, the coup committee issued a communique emphasizing that "adherence to neutrality must be guaranteed by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. At present, there are neutral countries in Asia such as Cambodia, Burma, and Ceylon, and Laos will also follow such a neutral path." The policies announced by the Lao coup committee reflect the urgent demands of the Lao people. After this coup, the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement supporting the main policies of the coup committee, and the Lao people have also written letters to the coup committee, expressing their support for the policies it has announced, and urgently demanding that the coup committee adhere to these policies to the end. A large demonstration of 15,000 people was also held in Vientiane, in which the demonstrators angrily condemned the former Phoui Sananikone-Nosavan government for "depending on foreign countries" and demanded that "U.S. imperialism get out." All these indicate that the Lao people resolutely oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and enslavement, resolutely demand the maintenance of their national independence, earnestly abide by the Geneva Accords, and follow the path of peace and neutrality.

Laos returning to the path stipulated by the Geneva Accords is great good news for the Lao people who are eager to follow a path of peace and neutrality, and it is also welcomed and supported by all countries and people who care about Lao national independence and Indochinese peace. However, U.S. imperialism, which has always been hostile to the independence of the people of Asian countries and has undermined the policy of peace and neutrality pursued by the governments of Asian countries, has adopted a hostile attitude towards this coup in Laos from the very beginning. The "New York Herald Tribune," reflecting the views of the U.S. monopoly capitalist groups, wrote on the 11th that "if Kong Le consolidates his revolution, an unfavorable neutral wedge will be driven into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization area." The United States "probably will not allow itself to be indecently expelled by a new regime." When the new government of Laos has already been established, and the pro-American traitorous government of Phoui Sananikone no longer exists, the U.S. State Department on the 16th even clamored that "the U.S. government will continue to recognize the old government of Laos." In fact, the United States is not only trying to maintain the pro-American traitorous government of Phoui Sananikone, but is also plotting to intervene in Laos through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The Secretary-General of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Sarasin, announced on the evening of the 16th that the Southeast Asia group may hold an emergency meeting to plan intervention in Laos. In order to create an excuse for the intervention of the Southeast Asian aggressive group, Sarasin insisted that the changes in the Lao political situation have affected the "security" of the Southeast Asian region. In the U.S. intervention plan, Thailand plays an important role. The Thai cabinet has held a series of "emergency" meetings, ordering the Thai army and border police to be in a "combat-ready state" and implementing "special alert" measures in order to take action when necessary. At the same time, U.S. imperialism is stepping up its efforts to instigate the extremely pro-American traitorous clique in Laos to deploy an attack on Vientiane. The head of this traitorous clique, Phoumi Nosavan, secretly went to Bangkok after the Lao coup to hold "emergency consultations" with Thai officials. According to Western news agencies, Nosavan has already gathered troops in southern Laos to prepare for an offensive. U.S. imperialism and its accomplices are stepping up the transport of large quantities of military supplies to support the Phoumi Nosavan clique. All this shows that U.S. imperialism is plotting to carry out armed intervention in Laos through the Southeast Asia aggressive group and strangle the coup. This, of course, cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of the Lao patriotic people and the people of Asia and even the world. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has issued a statement supporting the policy of peace and neutrality announced by the new government of the Kingdom of Laos, and strongly opposing all conspiracies and actions of U.S. imperialism to interfere in Laos.

There are two futures for the situation in Laos: one is that the patriotic forces of Laos unite, adhere to the direction of domestic peace, national independence, democratic freedom, and peaceful neutrality, and thwart the intervention plans of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, and smash the restoration conspiracy of the extremely pro-American traitorous clique. The other future is that the evil conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs succeed, and the Lao people are once again plunged into the dark abyss. Striving for the first future and opposing the second future is a serious task facing the Lao people and all patriots.

China is a participant in the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue and a close neighbor of Laos. We have always been concerned about the peace and independence of Laos, concerned about the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos, and fully sympathize with and resolutely support the just struggle of the Lao people against U.S. aggression, for the maintenance of national independence, and for the realization of domestic peace. We warmly support the policy of peace and neutrality announced by the Souvanna Phouma government and resolutely oppose any form of U.S. interference and aggression against Laos. The Chinese people sincerely hope to see our neighbor Laos get rid of the enslavement and oppression of U.S. imperialism, embark on the road of peace, neutrality, independence, and freedom, and embark on the road of national unity, prosperity, and strength. The Chinese government has consistently pursued a good-neighborly and friendly policy of peaceful coexistence. We firmly believe that a peaceful and neutral Laos will open up good prospects for the establishment and development of friendly relations between our two countries on the basis

    老挝人民爱国斗争的新发展
    本报评论员
    以老挝王国第二伞兵营指挥官贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会于8月9日晨发动政变，控制了首都万象。老挝国民议会一致决定不再承认松萨尼特政府。富马亲王在老挝国王授权下，已经正式组成了老挝王国的新政府，并且宣布新政府的对内政策主要是，恢复全国的安宁，停止老挝人之间的自相残杀，实行民族和睦；对外主要是实行真正的中立；尊重各项协议，包括日内瓦协议；接受所有国家不附带任何军事、政治、经济条件的援助等等。老挝政局的这一新发展，反映了老挝人民要求实现国内和平、维护民族独立和实行和平中立政策的强烈愿望，是值得一切关心老挝和印度支那和平的国家和人民重视的。
    本来，1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议，以及1957年11月老挝王国的富马政府同前寮国战斗部队根据这一协议而达成的万象协议，都明确规定了老挝的和平、独立、民主统一和中立的道路。按照这两个协议，老挝曾经一度实现了和平统一。但是，美帝国主义蓄意要把老挝变成自己的殖民地和军事基地，多方唆使老挝王国政府破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议。近年以来，美帝国主义利用“美援”和派遣大量的军事人员控制了老挝王国的军队，扶植了极端亲美的富米·诺萨万集团。这个集团执行投靠美帝国主义的卖国政策，使老挝逐步丧失了独立的地位。美帝国主义更竭力推行“用老挝人打老挝人”的罪恶政策，唆使老挝亲美卖国集团挑起了老挝的内战，破坏了老挝的和平。去年年底，美帝国主义又唆使老挝极端亲美的卖国集团“保卫国家利益委员会”发动了军事政变，最近又在老挝导演了“选举”丑剧，建立了实际上是在这个卖国集团直接控制下的松萨尼特政府。同时，美帝国主义还千方百计地阴谋把老挝拉进东南亚条约组织。
    在这种情况下，老挝局势更加恶化了。老挝的内战扩大了，越来越多的老挝爱国人民惨遭杀戮和被投入监狱，老挝的国土遭到了美帝国主义及其走狗的蹂躏。正如老挝政变委员会在告人民书中所揭露的，“美国对我国的干涉日益加深。到处都有常驻美国人”；老挝的亲美卖国政权“使我国面临没落，无缘无故地残杀人民，逮捕和监禁老挝的爱国者以便换取美援，为他们个人的利益服务”；“军队的指挥部还下令军队去镇压和迫害爱和平的同胞，烧毁同胞们的房子和粮仓……”
    所有这些残酷的事实，深刻地教育了老挝人民。曾经为了争取独立自由进行过半世纪英勇斗争的老挝人民，从法国殖民统治下挣脱出来以后，能够容忍美帝国主义把殖民枷锁重新套在自己的脖颈上吗？老挝爱国军官和士兵在人民支持下发动政变，推翻卖国的政府，正是老挝人民对于美国侵略者的一个有力回答。
    老挝广大人民要求的是什么呢？以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会在历次公报和声明中宣布，老挝王国的新政策应该是：对内停止内战，恢复国内和平；“取消行贿的弊病”，“尊重民主制度，尊重人权”；对外则要求“立即取消外国在老挝的军事基地，反对外国的干涉”，“把外国军队赶出老挝”，“本着和平共处的五项原则”，“实行中立的政策，并积极同愿意与老挝建立良好关系”的国家“建立友好关系和睦邻关系”。在富马亲王被任命为老挝新首相的当天，政变委员会发表公报还强调指出，“坚持中立就必须以和平共处的五项原则作为保证。目前亚洲已有柬埔寨、缅甸、锡兰等中立国家，老挝也将走这样的中立道路”。老挝政变委员会所宣布的这些政策，反映了老挝人民的迫切要求。在这次政变之后，老挝爱国战线党曾经发表声明，支持政变委员会的主要政策，老挝人民也纷纷写信给政变委员会，表示支持它所宣布的这些政策，并迫切要求政变委员会把这些政策坚持到底。万象还曾举行了一万五千人的大示威，示威群众愤怒地谴责前松萨尼特—诺萨万政府“依附外国”，并要求“美帝国主义滚回去”。所有这些都表明，老挝人民坚决反对美帝国主义侵略和奴役，坚决要求维护自己的民族独立，切实遵守日内瓦协议，走和平中立的道路。
    老挝重新走上日内瓦协议规定的道路，这对于渴望走和平中立的老挝人民来说是莫大的喜讯，也受到所有关心老挝民族独立和印度支那和平的国家和人民的欢迎和支持。但是，一贯敌视亚洲各国人民的独立、破坏亚洲各国政府奉行和平中立政策的美帝国主义，对于老挝这次政变，从一开始就采取敌视的态度。反映美国垄断资本集团的意见的“纽约先驱论坛报”11日写道，“如果贡勒巩固他的革命，一个不利的中立的楔子就要打进东南亚条约组织地区”。美国“大概不肯让自己不体面地被一个新政权驱逐出去。”当老挝新政府已经成立，松萨尼特亲美卖国政府已经再不存在的情况下，美国国务院16日竟然叫嚷“美国政府将继续承认老挝的旧政府”。实际上，美国不仅力图维护松萨尼特亲美卖国政府，而且正在阴谋通过东南亚条约组织，准备对老挝进行干涉。东南亚条约组织秘书长沙拉信16日晚上宣布，东南亚集团可能召开紧急会议策划干涉老挝。为了替东南亚侵略集团干涉制造借口，沙拉信硬说，老挝政局的变化影响了东南亚地区的“安全”。在美国的干涉计划中，泰国充当一个重要的角色。泰国内阁曾举行了一系列的“紧急”会议，命令泰国军队和边防警察处于“战斗备战状态”中，实行“特种戒备”，以便必要时采取行动。与此同时，美帝国主义正加紧策动老挝极端亲美卖国集团布置对万象的进攻。这个卖国集团的头子富米·诺萨万在老挝政变后，曾经潜往曼谷同泰国官员举行“紧急商谈”。据西方通讯社报道，诺萨万已经在老挝南部纠集兵力，准备发动进攻。美帝国主义及其帮凶正加紧运送大批军火支持富米·诺萨万集团。这一切表明，美帝国主义正在策划通过东南亚侵略集团对老挝进行武装干涉、扼杀政变的阴谋。这当然不能不引起老挝爱国人民和亚洲人民以至全世界人民的严重警惕。越南民主共和国政府已发表声明，支持老挝王国新政府宣布的和平中立政策，强烈反对美帝国主义干涉老挝的一切阴谋和行动。
    老挝的局势存在着两个前途：一个是老挝的爱国力量团结起来，坚持国内和平、民族独立、民主自由、和平中立的方向，挫败美帝国主义及其帮凶的干涉计划，粉碎极端亲美卖国集团的复辟阴谋。另一个前途是美帝国主义及其走狗的罪恶阴谋得逞，重新把老挝人民投入黑暗的深渊。争取第一个前途，反对第二个前途，是摆在老挝人民和一切爱国人士面前的严重任务。
    中国是日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的会议的参加国，是老挝亲近的邻邦。我们历来关心老挝的和平和独立，关心日内瓦协议在老挝的实施，并充分同情和坚决支持老挝人民反对美国侵略、维护民族独立、实现国内和平的正义斗争。我们热烈支持富马政府所宣布的和平中立政策，坚决反对美国对老挝进行任何形式的干涉和侵略。中国人民衷心地愿意看到我国的邻邦老挝能够摆脱美帝国主义的奴役和压迫，走上和平中立、独立自由的道路，走上民族团结、富强繁荣的道路。中国政府一贯奉行和平共处的睦邻友好政策。我们深信，一个和平中立的老挝，将为我们两国在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立和发展友好关系，开辟良好的前景。
