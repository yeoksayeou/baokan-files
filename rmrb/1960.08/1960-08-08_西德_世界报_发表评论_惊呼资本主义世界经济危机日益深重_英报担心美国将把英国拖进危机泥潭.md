Xinhua News Agency, Bonn: A recent economic commentary by Ferdinand Fried in the West German newspaper "Die Welt" stated, "If everything isn't wrong, it (the United States) is once again facing a recession."

The commentary exclaimed about the deepening capitalist world crisis. It pointed out that since the Second World War, the "shocks" suffered by the capitalist world from economic crises have been "even more intense."

The commentary also said that the great crisis that occurred in the capitalist world in 1929-1930 "was not a general crisis, but a collapse of the system's structure." It completely disrupted the cycle of capitalist economic crises.

The commentary pointed out that the cycle of capitalist world economic crises has now shortened to intervals of only two or three years.

Xinhua News Agency, London: British newspapers are closely watching the deteriorating U.S. economic situation, worrying that another U.S. "economic recession" in the making will drag the British economy into the mire of crisis.

The "Times" published an article on August 2nd titled "Wall Street's Doubts." The article worriedly said that British and other Western European exporters have already begun to feel the impact of the current U.S. economic "stagnation." It said that exports of cars to the United States have already declined. "If the U.S. economy experiences a recession later this year or in early 1961, a wider range of British goods will certainly be affected."

The "Financial Times" said on the same day: "The sudden and massive outflow of American gold, totaling $158 million in the past three weeks, is occurring at a rate as fast as in 1958, the worst year since the war."

The "Financial Times" also published an article by its economic correspondent on July 29th, saying: "The current depression in the American financial world can be linked to another piece of bad news across the Atlantic, namely the decline in British exports to North America. These two things are partly due to the general slowdown in the pace of American businesses." The article pointed out that "the nature, extent, and duration of this slowdown appear to be the major destabilizing factor on the (capitalist) world economic stage in the remaining months of this year."

    西德“世界报”发表评论
    惊呼资本主义世界经济危机日益深重
    英报担心美国将把英国拖进危机泥潭
    据新华社波恩消息　西德“世界报”不久前登载的斐迪南·弗里特写的一篇经济评论中说，“如果不是一切都错了的话，它（美国）再次面临着一次衰退。”
    这篇评论对资本主义世界危机日益深重发出惊呼。它指出，自从第二次世界大战以后，资本主义世界所受到的经济危机的“震荡更其强烈了”。
    评论还说，1929—1930年资本主义世界所发生的大危机“不是一般的危机，而是体系结构的崩溃”。它完全打乱了资本主义经济危机的周期。
    评论指出，资本主义世界经济危机周期现在已缩短到只有二、三年的间隔了。
    据新华社讯　伦敦消息：英国报纸正在密切注视日益恶化的美国经济情况，它们担心酝酿中的另一次美国“经济衰退”将会把英国经济也拖入危机的泥潭中。
    “泰晤士报”2日以“华尔街的怀疑”为题发表文章。文章担心地说，英国和其他西欧国家出口商已经开始感觉到目前美国经济“呆滞”的影响。它说，对美国的汽车出口已经下降。“如果美国经济在今年晚些时候或1961年年初发生衰退的话，肯定会有种类更为广泛的英国商品受到影响。”
    “金融时报”同一天说：“美国黄金突然又大量外流，在过去三周，就有一亿五千八百万美元的黄金外流——外流的速率同战后最坏的一年1958年一样快。”
    “金融时报”7月29日还刊载它的经济记者的一篇文章说：“目前美国金融界的不振可以同大洋彼岸的另一个坏消息联系起来，那就是英国对北美的输出下降。这两件事部分是由于美国企业的步伐普遍放慢。”文章指出，“这种放慢的性质、程度和持续时间看来是今年剩下的几个月中（资本主义）世界经济舞台上主要的不稳定因素。”
