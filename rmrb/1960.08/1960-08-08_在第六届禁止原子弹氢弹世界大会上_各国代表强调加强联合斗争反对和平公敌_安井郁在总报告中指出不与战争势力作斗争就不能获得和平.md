Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: The Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament formally opened in a grand ceremony on the 6th – the 15th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by the United States – at the Tokyo Gymnasium.

Attending the conference were 11,000 Japanese representatives and 130 foreign representatives from 30 countries, including China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, as well as 10 international organizations such as the World Peace Council and the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The conference heard the general report made by Ikuei Yasui, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, as well as congratulatory messages and speeches from foreign and Japanese representatives.

All the Japanese representatives are representatives of people from all walks of life in Japan who have bravely fought to oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" over the past eighteen months. They come from various regions, factories, and social strata.

When the 130 foreign representatives entered the venue, the Japanese representatives stood up and welcomed them with thunderous applause. The Chinese delegation, which had not attended the conference for more than two years, received a particularly warm welcome.

At the beginning of the conference, all the representatives stood in silence for one minute to mourn the people killed by the American atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki fifteen years ago. Then, the people in the venue solemnly sang the song "We Must Never Let the Atomic Bomb Be Dropped a Third Time."

The conference elected a presidium composed of 37 Japanese representatives and 31 foreign representatives.

Indonesian representative Matatulargawa spoke on behalf of the presidium. He praised the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance and called on those attending the conference to fight together with the people of all countries around the world.

The conference then adopted two emergency resolutions. Akira Kazami, head of the Japanese delegation, put forward a resolution regarding the extension of the Chinese delegation's stay in Japan. Akira Kazami said: "China has always encouraged the Japanese people's struggle against American imperialism. The unity between the Japanese and Chinese people against their common enemy has been strengthened. The Ikeda government's attitude of not allowing the extension of the Chinese representatives' visas shows its hostile attitude towards China; it shows that it is attempting to obstruct the development of friendly relations between the two peoples. I suggest that a protest be lodged with the government in the name of the conference."

Another resolution, proposed by Masaharu Hatanaka, Chairman of the Japan-Korea Association, requested that visas be issued to the delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea who wished to come to Japan to participate in the World Conference.

In his general report at the conference, Ikuei Yasui, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, put forward the goals to be achieved by this conference. He said: "At this conference, we will strive to formulate a basic policy for the joint struggle of peace forces against the forces of war." He continued: "Through this struggle, we will strive to achieve the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs and disarmament, thereby making true peaceful coexistence possible."

Speaking of the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty," Ikuei Yasui said: "This nationwide struggle against the 'Security Treaty,' in which all the democratic forces in Japan were fully mobilized, has achieved some important goals." He emphasized: "It forced the government to cancel Eisenhower's scheduled visit to Japan, followed by the collective resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. This is a decisive blow to attempts to strengthen military blocs in the Far East."

Ikuei Yasui emphasized: "We have learned through fierce struggles that we must draw a clear line between our friends and enemies. We are determined to fight against the forces that promote militarism and the Cold War policy." Ikuei Yasui particularly emphasized: "Peace cannot be achieved without fighting against the forces of war." "In this regard, we, the Japanese people, have gained valuable lessons through the recent struggle against the security treaty."

Yasui expressed great pleasure at the arrival of the Chinese representatives in Japan. He said: "We should unite our efforts to prevent the revival of militarism and to build Japan into a peaceful country that does not adopt a hostile policy towards China."

Yasui concluded his speech by saying: Justice and fairness are on the side of the people. "Our movement will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles and achieve brilliant results."

Bulgakov, head of the Soviet delegation, said: "It is possible to prevent war because the forces striving for peace in the world are more strongly united than ever before."

Sudanese representative Keir, speaking on behalf of the people of various African countries, called on the peace-loving people of all continents to unite today to oppose their common enemy, American imperialism. His speech won prolonged applause.

Chilean representative Ventulelli, speaking on behalf of the people of various Latin American countries, said: "The people of Latin America and the people of Japan have both drawn experience from the struggle against concluding military alliances with the United States." He said: "Treaties opposed by the people are not binding on them. In the face of popular opposition, such treaties will actually become invalid."

West German representative Kohlberg said on behalf of the people of various Western European countries that the Japanese people's struggle against the conclusion of aggressive military treaties is a great encouragement to the people of various European countries who are fighting against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Australian representative Crawford emphasized in his speech that true peace can only be achieved by abolishing and removing all foreign bases and completely and thoroughly abolishing armaments. He emphasized that all workers around the world must strengthen the struggle for peace and unite more closely.

In his speech, Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation, pointed out that the Japanese people's struggle is part of the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism, and it has received the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world. He also said that the Chinese people have always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and are even more willing to promote the normalization of relations between the two countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with its neighbor, Japan. The Chinese people have always supported the Japanese people's desire to take the road of independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that as long as Japan does not take the road of militarism, China and Japan can coexist peacefully for a long time. The Chinese people and government have also repeatedly advocated that countries in Asia and the Pacific Rim, including the United States, jointly sign a non-aggression peace pact to make this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

Liu Ningyi said that the Chinese people do not need war, nor will they allow others to impose war on us. We are willing to fight to defend world peace and to achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

American representative John Kelly emphasized the need to abolish all military bases in foreign countries, and he also advocated the conclusion of a non-aggression agreement between socialist and capitalist countries.

Asanuma Inajiro, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, and Nosaka Sanzo, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, also addressed the conference.

Asanuma emphasized that for the Japanese people, true peace can only be guaranteed by abolishing all U.S. bases in Japan and the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Asanuma said: "We are working for this kind of peace." Asanuma hoped that all those attending the conference would cooperate with each other so that the struggle for peace and independence would be carried out on the basis of solid unity.

On behalf of the Japanese Communist Party, Nosaka Sanzo expressed his heartfelt thanks to the participants of the conference and to the Japanese and world people who participated in or supported the struggle against the "Security Treaty".

Nosaka said: "Now, two large-scale movements - the movement to abolish the Security Treaty and the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs - have been closely linked together." Nosaka said: "The Japanese people's historically significant struggle to achieve these two goals helps to expose American imperialism and Japanese reactionaries as enemies of peace in Asia and the world in front of millions of people."

Nosaka emphasized: "The three reports prepared by the preparatory meeting and submitted to the conference clarify the common enemies of peace and point out the correct direction that we should follow in promoting our peace struggle in the future."

Nosaka called on the participants to strengthen the struggle for peace more forcefully than before on the basis of the partial victories that have been achieved.

Hirano Yoshitaro, Standing Committee Member of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and Kadoma Yoshinobu, Vice Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, then addressed the conference. Hirano Yoshitaro emphasized that the achievements made by the Japanese people in the powerful struggle against the "Security Treaty" have become the common achievement of the people of the world in the struggle for peace.

Hirano Yoshitaro emphasized that in the struggle, "we must clearly know who is the enemy of peace and who is the friend of peace."

Representatives of the participants in the Peace March of the Japanese People then reported on the achievements of the Peace March, in which a total of 2.2 million people participated and covered a distance of 10,000 kilometers.

Hiroyuki Nakazawa, the leader of the marchers who started from Nemuro City in northern Japan, emphasized that the marchers were warmly welcomed by the people everywhere they passed. He said: "This march has proven to be a very effective way to unite all peace-loving people around the peace movement." He said that in Hakodate, the mass meeting held to welcome the marchers adopted the "Hokkaido Declaration," guaranteeing that the people of Hokkaido would never oppose the Soviet and Chinese people.

Matsuo Manabe, the leader of the marching team that started from Yoron Island at the southern tip of Japan and traveled 2,000 kilometers, emphasized that "the peace march has ended, but our movement must continue because our goals have not yet been achieved." He concluded by saying that the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs and for peace should be strengthened and expanded.

Senji Yamaguchi reported on behalf of the atomic bomb victims in Japan. In his report, Senji Yamaguchi said that he himself participated in the demonstration against Hagerty in order to tell the American presidential press secretary that as long as Eisenhower does not apologize for the atomic bombing and does not change the United States' war policy, the Japanese people will not welcome the American president.

Chinese representative Zhao Puchu then spoke, expressing the Chinese people's deep sympathy for the victims of the atomic bomb, and read a letter entrusted to him by seven Chinese organizations, including the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace.

The letter expressed the Chinese people's support for the Japanese people's struggle against American imperialism's war policy and aggression. The letter said that out of deep sympathy for the victims of the atomic bomb, the Chinese people donated 15 million yen as relief funds. After reading the letter, Zhao Puchu embraced eight atomic bomb victims one by one amidst thunderous applause.

Ikuei Yasui expressed his gratitude for the close friendship and goodwill of Zhao Puchu and the Chinese people.

Representatives from Okinawa, Atsugi, and Niijima, where U.S. military bases are located, made reports.

The Okinawa representative strongly condemned American imperialism for occupying Okinawa and turning it into a nuclear weapons base, thereby undermining world peace.

A representative of the residents near the Atsugi U.S. military base expressed the local residents' anger at the United States' occupation of the land of the people in the Atsugi area. He said: "We believe that the presence of the American army near our city is an insult to us." He talked about the notorious American U-2 spy plane that was once stationed at the Atsugi base, saying that the residents of Atsugi live in constant fear because they have such dangerous neighbors. He shouted: "American spy planes get out of Japan!"

When Maeharu Chiyo from Niijima talked about how the Japanese "Defense Agency" had to announce on the 6th that it would stop the missile base construction project on Shikine Island in the face of the persistent opposition of the islanders of Niijima and Shikine Island, the audience burst into a storm of applause. She appealed: "Let us launch a more powerful struggle for peace. Let our voice for peace resound throughout the world."

The conference adjourned at 8:30 p.m.

    在第六届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会上
    各国代表强调加强联合斗争反对和平公敌
    安井郁在总报告中指出不与战争势力作斗争就不能获得和平
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会正式会议6日——广岛遭受美国原子弹轰炸十五周年纪念日——在东京体育馆隆重开幕。
    出席大会的有一万一千名日本代表和来自中国、苏联、美国、英国、法国等三十个国家和世界和平理事会、世界工会联合会等十个国际组织的一百三十名外国代表。
    大会听取了日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁所作的总报告以及外国代表和日本代表的祝词和讲话。
    所有的日本代表是在过去十八个月里英勇地为反对修改日美“安全条约”而斗争的日本各阶层人民的代表。他们来自各个地区、各个工厂和各个社会阶层。
    当一百三十位外国代表进入会场的时候，日本代表起立，用雷鸣般的掌声欢迎他们。间断了两年多前来参加大会的中国代表团受到特别热烈的欢迎。
    在大会开始时，全体代表起立静默一分钟，悼念十五年前在广岛和长崎被美国原子弹杀害的人民。接着，会场中的人们一起庄穆地合唱歌曲“我们决不让原子弹再投第三回”。
    大会选出了由三十七位日本代表和三十一位外国代表组成的主席团。
    印度尼西亚代表马塔洛加瓦代表主席团发言。他盛赞日本人民反对日美军事同盟的斗争，并且呼吁出席大会的人同全世界各国人民一起进行斗争。
    大会然后通过了两项紧急决议。日本代表团长风见章提出了有关延长中国代表团在日本逗留时期问题的决议。风见章说：“中国一贯鼓励日本人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。日本人民和中国人民反对他们共同敌人的团结已经加强了。池田政府不准延长中国代表签证的态度，说明它对中国采取敌视态度；说明它企图阻挠两国人民友好关系的发展。我建议以大会的名义向政府提出抗议。”
    另一项由日朝协会理事长畑中政春提出的决议要求把签证发给希望来日本参加世界大会的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁在大会上作的总报告中提出这次大会要实现的目标。他说：“我们将在这次大会上努力制订和平力量对战争势力进行联合斗争的基本政策。”他接着说：“通过这种斗争，我们争取实现禁止原子弹、氢弹和裁军，从而使真正的和平共处成为可能。”
    安井郁在谈到日本人民反对“安全条约”的斗争时说：“日本所有的民主力量都充分动员起来的这个全国性反对‘安全条约’的斗争，已经实现了某些重要的目标。”他强调说：“它迫使政府取消了艾森豪威尔预订对日本的访问，接着是岸信介内阁集体辞职。这是对企图在远东加强军事集团的做法的决定性打击。”
    安井郁强调说：“我们通过激烈的斗争懂得，我们在我们的朋友和敌人之间必须划清界限。我们决意为反对促进军国主义和冷战政策的势力而斗争。”安井郁特别强调指出：“不同战争势力作斗争就不能获得和平”。“在这方面，我们日本人民通过最近的反对安全条约的斗争，已获得可贵的经验教训。”
  安井对于中国代表们来到日本表示非常高兴。他说：“我们应该联合起来作出努力来防止军国主义复活，来把日本建成一个不对中国采取敌对政策的和平国家”。
    安井在讲话中最后说：正义和公正是在人民这一边的。“我们的运动将能克服一切困难和障碍而获得辉煌的结果”。
    苏联代表团团长布尔加科夫说：“由于世界争取和平的力量比以往任何时期更加强有力地团结起来，防止战争是可能的。”
    苏丹代表凯尔代表非洲各国人民讲话时，要求各大洲爱好和平的各国人民今天团结起来反对他们的共同敌人美帝国主义。他的讲话博得了长时间的掌声。
    智利代表万徒勒里代表拉丁美洲各国人民讲话说：“拉丁美洲人民和日本人民都从反对同美国缔结军事同盟的斗争中吸取到经验。”他说：“为人民所反对的条约对他们没有约束力。这种条约在人民反对的面前，实际上将变得无效。”
    西德代表科耳贝格以西欧各国人民的名义说，日本人民反对缔结侵略性的军事条约的斗争，对于为反对北大西洋公约组织而斗争的欧洲各国人民，是一个极大的鼓励。
    澳大利亚代表克劳福德在发言时强调说，只有取消和撤除所有的外国基地，全面和彻底废除军备，才能实现真正的和平。他强调全世界的所有工人必须加强争取和平的斗争，更加紧密地团结起来。
    中国代表团团长刘宁一在讲话中指出，日本人民的斗争是全世界人民反对帝国主义的斗争的一部分，它得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的支持。他还说，中国人民一贯主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，对于自己的近邻日本，更是愿意根据五项原则，来促使两国关系正常化。中国人民一向支持日本人民走独立、和平、民主、中立道路的愿望。中国政府曾经一再表示，只要日本不走军国主义的道路，中日两国是可以长期和平共处的。中国人民和政府还一再主张，亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内，共同签订一项互不侵犯的和平公约，使这一地区成为无核武器区。
    刘宁一说，中国人民不需要战争，也不允许别人把战争强加在我们头上。我们愿意为保卫世界和平，为实现不同社会制度国家间的和平共处而奋斗。
    美国代表约翰·凯利强调必须取消一切在外国的军事基地，他并且主张缔结社会主义国家与资本主义国家之间的互不侵犯协定。
    在大会上致词的有日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎和共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三。
    浅沼强调说：对日本人民来说，只有废除美国在日本的一切基地和美日军事同盟条约，真正的和平才能有保证。浅沼说：“我们正在为这种和平而努力。”浅沼希望，所有出席大会的人们相互合作，使争取和平和独立的斗争在牢固的团结的基础上进行。
    野坂参三代表日本共产党向大会参加者以及参加或支持反对“安全条约”斗争的日本和全世界人民表示衷心的感谢。
    野坂说：“现在，两个大规模的运动——争取废除安全条约的运动和禁止原子弹和氢弹的运动——已经紧紧地联结在一起了。”野坂说：“日本人民争取实现这两项目标的具有历史意义的斗争有助于在千千万万人民面前揭露美帝国主义和日本反动派是亚洲和世界和平的敌人。”
    野坂强调说：“预备会议所拟订并向大会提出的三项报告明确了和平的共同敌人，并且指出了将来推进我们的和平斗争时所应该依据的正确方针。”
    野坂号召参加者在已经取得的部分胜利的基础上比以前更有力地加强争取和平的斗争。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会常务委员会委员平野义太郎和日本工会总评议会副议长门间吉信接着向大会发言。平野义太郎强调说，日本人民在反对“安全条约”的有力斗争中所取得的成就已经成为世界各国人民争取和平斗争中的共同战果。
    平野义太郎着重指出，在斗争中，“我们必须清楚地知道，谁是和平的敌人，谁是和平的朋友。”
    日本人民和平大游行参加者的代表们接着报告了关于共有两千两百万人参加的、路程达一万公里的和平大游行的成就。
    从日本北部的根室市出发的游行者的领袖中泽广哉强调说，在游行者经过的一切地方，他们都受到人民热烈的欢迎。他说：“这次游行证明，它是把一切爱好和平的人团结在和平运动周围的非常有效的形式。”他说，在函馆，为欢迎游行者而举行的群众大会通过了“北海道宣言”，保证北海道的人民将决不反对苏联和中国人民。
    从日本南端的与论岛出发并走了二千公里路程的游行队伍的领袖真锅松夫着重指出，“和平游行已经结束，但是我们的运动仍然要进行，因为我们的目标还没有实现。”他最后说，反对原子弹氢弹和争取和平的运动应该加强和扩大。
    山口仙二代表日本的原子弹受害者作了报告。山口仙二在报告中说，他本人参加了反对哈格蒂的示威，为的是告诉这个美国总统新闻秘书，只要艾森豪威尔不对原子弹轰炸一事赔不是、不改变美国的战争政策，日本人民将不会欢迎这个美国总统。
    中国代表赵朴初接着讲话，他表示了中国人民对原子弹受害者的深切同情，并且宣读了中国人民保卫世界和平委员会等七个中国团体托他转达的一封信。
    信件表示中国人民支持日本人民反对美帝国主义战争政策和侵略的斗争。信件说，中国人民出于对原子弹受害者的深切同情，赠给他们一千五百万日元作为救济金。赵朴初在宣读了这封信以后在雷动的掌声中逐一拥抱了八名原子弹受害者。
    安井郁表示感谢赵朴初和中国人民亲密的友情和好意。
    设有美军基地的冲绳、厚木、新岛地区的代表作了报告。
    冲绳代表强烈谴责美帝国主义霸占冲绳，使冲绳成为核武器基地，从而破坏世界和平。
    厚木美军基地附近的居民代表表示当地居民对美国霸占厚木地区人民的土地感到愤怒。他说：“我们认为，美国军队驻在我们城市附近是对我们的侮辱。”他谈到曾经驻在厚木基地上的臭名远扬的美国U—2型间谍飞机说，厚木居民生活在经常的恐惧之中，因为有这样危险的邻居。他高呼：“美国间谍飞机滚出日本！”
    当来自新岛的前然春代谈到日本“防卫厅”面临新岛和敷根岛岛民的坚持不懈的反对，不得不在6日宣布停止敷根岛的导弹基地建筑工程时，全场响起暴风雨般的掌声。她呼吁说：“让我们发动更强有力的争取和平的斗争。让我们争取和平的呼声响遍全世界。”
    大会在八点三十分休会。
