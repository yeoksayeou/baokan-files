This newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on August 13th: Under the leadership of the Jincheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Jincheng County's rural work has undergone tremendous changes with the full support of the county's industry, transportation, commerce, and education sectors, as well as the military.

At the beginning of July, all sectors in Jincheng County, under the leadership of the Jincheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, launched activities to fully support agriculture. More than 260 county-run factories and mines adopted the method of large factories supporting communes, small factories supporting districts, with long-term fixed relationships that would remain unchanged for three years. They promptly dispatched 70 leading cadres and 1,000 skilled workers to 12 communes and management districts with which they had established links. In just 20 days, they produced more than 350 sets of various powered and animal-drawn irrigation and drainage machines, 2,570 sets of tillage implements, and 680 transportation vehicles for the communes and management districts. They also repaired more than 190 sets of various powered irrigation and drainage machines, manufactured more than 1,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, and extracted some temporarily unused power machinery, rubber hoses, high-voltage lines, scrap steel, and sulfur from factories to support the linked communes.

The transportation departments promptly transported machinery and chemical fertilizers to various management districts and production teams. The commercial departments dispatched more than 4,830 employees, forming more than 130 purchasing and supply shock teams, who promptly supplied various means of production needed for agricultural production and, combined with the supply effort, contributed 30,000 workdays to agricultural labor.

The 140,000 teachers and students in the county's schools, through school-district collaboration and combining labor with education, contributed a total of 420,000 workdays to the struggle for combating drought and protecting seedlings. In addition, they also helped 309 management districts establish many small chlorella manufacturing plants.

Due to the vigorous support of all sectors, significant changes have begun to take place in various aspects of rural work: First, the relationship between workers and peasants has become closer. Through the activities of supporting agriculture, employees of all sectors have received a profound ideological education with agriculture as the foundation, and they are more timely and proactive in supporting agriculture, and the products they support are more suitable for the needs of the peasants. After receiving support from all parties, the peasant masses have even greater enthusiasm, expressing that they must work hard, rely on their own efforts, and do a good job in production to produce more grain to support industry with everyone's support. Second, the work style of cadres has been further improved. Since the four-level cadres converged in the fields, the cadres of this county have achieved "three haves" (have tools, have a labor manual, have an experimental plot) and "four togethers" (eat together, live together, work together, and consult together), each acting as "six personnel" (commander, combatant, technician, propagandist, cook, and feeder), and their work style is more solid and meticulous. Third, backward areas have caught up with advanced ones. In supporting agriculture, all departments have paid special attention to helping some backward areas. In the summer hoeing, topdressing, and watering field management, the face of 20 backward management districts and 105 backward production teams has begun to change, of which eight management districts and 55 production teams have caught up with the first-class areas, and most have caught up with the second-class areas. Fourth, the degree of mechanization of agricultural production has been improved. Thanks to the industrial sector's support with a large number of agricultural machines, plus the original various machines, the county's rural areas have basically achieved motorized water lifting, mechanized tillage, and mechanized cooking appliances in canteens, and labor efficiency has increased by one to dozens of times compared with the past, which is equivalent to adding 120,000 laborers and 140,000 animal power to the rural areas. Fifth, canteen work has been greatly improved. After the leaders at all levels went down to the countryside, they all paid attention to grasping the work of the canteens. Now the county has planted 150,000 mu of vegetables, with an average of 0.25 mu per person, and has stored more than 2.5 million catties of dried vegetables. Since the Yangshan Management District Canteen of Donggou Commune has vigorously grasped vegetables, each person can eat three catties of vegetables a day, and the life is very good. Sixth, the enthusiasm of the commune members for production is unprecedentedly high. The support from all sectors has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the commune members, and labor efficiency has been continuously improved. The daily progress of weeding seedlings has increased from the original 19,000 mu per day to 42,000 mu, the daily progress of topdressing has increased from the original 17,000 mu to 35,000 mu, and the daily progress of watering has increased from the original 4,400 mu to 13,000 mu. The county's 880,000 mu of autumn crops have been hoeed twice, and 380,000 mu have been topdressed twice. The county's 580,000 mu of late autumn crops have been hoeed once, 100,000 mu have been topdressed once, and 470,000 mu have been irrigated, an increase of 170,000 mu compared with the past. Whether it is mountainous or plains, early autumn or late autumn, large or small fields, the crops are growing very well.

    领导下乡　劳力下乡　机具下乡
    晋城大批后进单位生产赶上先进
    全县农村基本实现提水动力化、中耕机具化、炊具土机械化
    本报太原13日电　山西省晋城县农村工作，在全县工、交、商、学、兵全力支援下，已发生了很大的变化。
    7月初，晋城县各行各业就在中共晋城县委的领导下，开展了全力支援农业的活动。全县二百六十多个县营以上的厂矿采取大厂包社，小厂包区，长期固定，三年不变的办法，及时派出七十名领导干部和一千名技术工人，深入到十二个公社和管理区挂上了钩。他们只用了二十天时间，就为公社和管理区制出各种动力、畜力排灌机械三百五十多部、中耕机具两千五百七十部、运输工具六百八十多辆，修配好各种动力排灌机械一百九十多部，制造化肥一千多吨，并从工厂抽出一部分暂时用不着的动力机械、胶管、高压线、废钢材、硫磺支援了各挂钩公社。
    交通部门则及时把机械和化肥等物资运到各管理区和生产队。商业部门抽出四千八百三十多名职工，组成一百三十多个采购供应突击队，及时供应了农业生产上所需要的各类生产资料，并结合供应帮助农业做了三万个劳动日。
    全县各学校十四万师生通过校区挂钩、劳教结合，在农业抗旱保苗斗争中，共做了四十二万个工，另外还帮助三百零九个管理区建立了许多小球藻制造厂。
    由于各行各业的大力支援，农村的各项工作都在开始发生显著的变化：一、工农关系更密切了。各行各业的职工通过支援农业的活动，受到了一次深刻的以农业为基础的思想教育，支援农业更加及时主动，支援的产品更加适合农民的要求；农民群众受到各方支援后，劲头更大，表示一定要在大家的支援下，发奋图强，自力更生，搞好生产多打粮食，支援工业；二、干部作风进一步得到改进。自从四级干部会师到田间后，这个县的干部已做到三有（有工具、有劳动手册、有“试验田”）四同（同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量），个个充当六员（指挥员、战斗员、技术员、宣传员、炊事员、饲养员），工作作风更加踏实细致；三、后进地区赶上了先进。各部门在支援农业中，特别注意了对一些后进地区的帮助。在夏季锄苗、追肥、浇地等田间管理中，已有二十个后进管理区和一百零五个后进生产队面貌开始发生变化，其中有八个管理区五十五个生产队赶上了一类地区，大部分赶上了二类地区；四、提高了农业生产机械化的程度。由于工业部门支援了大量的农业机具，加上原有各种机械，全县农村现已基本实现了提水动力化、中耕机具化、食堂炊具土机械化，劳动效率都比原来提高了一倍至几十倍，等于为农村增加了十二万个劳动力和十四万个畜力；五、食堂工作大改善。各级领导干部下去以后，都注意了抓食堂工作。现在全县已经种了十五万亩菜，每人平均二分半，并储备二百五十多万斤干菜。东沟公社杨山管理区食堂自从大抓蔬菜后，每人每天可以吃到三斤菜，生活搞得很好；六、社员生产积极性空前高涨。各行各业的支援对社员的生产情绪鼓舞很大，劳动效率不断提高，锄苗日进度由原来每日一万九千亩增加到四万二千亩，追肥日进度由原来一万七千亩增加到三万五千亩，浇地日进度由原来四千四百亩增加到一万三千亩。全县八十八万亩大秋作物普锄了二遍，三十八万亩上了两次追肥。全县五十八万亩晚秋作物普锄头遍，十万亩施过一次追肥，灌溉四十七万亩，比原来增加了十七万亩。无论山地平川，早秋晚秋，大田小田，庄稼生长得都很好。
