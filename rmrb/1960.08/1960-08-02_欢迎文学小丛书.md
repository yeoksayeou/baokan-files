	Welcome Literary Pocket Series Xu Zhao
	The People's Literature Publishing House has published four series of "Literary Pocket Series" since last year, totaling one hundred and forty titles. These pocket series mostly select good works from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign. The "Elementary Literary Readings" pocket series published by the Writers Publishing House selects excellent short stories or excerpts from well-established works in Chinese and foreign literature. Each book is accompanied by several illustrations, making them truly a combination of text and pictures. The "Popular Readings of Classical Literature" pocket series published by Zhonghua Book Company selects works from classical literature that possess democratic essence and are popular among the masses. It is worth mentioning that the editors have adopted various editing methods according to the form and content of the works: prose is translated into vernacular Chinese and compared with the original text, while poetry, lyrics, and operas are annotated in simple terms. The language used in the explanations, annotations, and translations is made as accessible as possible, striving for colloquialization and standardization. Even people with limited literacy can understand them. In addition, each volume includes a brief commentary on the selected works and authors, which is very helpful for readers to read, understand, and analyze the works.
	The publication of these literary pocket series is a good thing for literary popularization work. Their content is a compilation of literary masterpieces; each book has a small number of words, a small size, and can be carried around. This is a great benefit for people who are very busy and have limited time, especially the vast number of workers and peasants who applaud and welcome them. Readers not only gain a wealth of world literary knowledge from the books, increasing their ability to understand life and inspiring everyone's enthusiasm for building a new socialist life, but also absorb nourishment from creative methods and literary and artistic techniques. This has a enhancing and inspirational effect on today's increasingly vigorous mass creative movement.

    欢迎文学小丛书	徐照
    人民文学出版社由去年至今共出版了四辑《文学小丛书》，共一百四十种。这些小丛书选的大部分都是古今中外的好作品。作家出版社出版的《文学初步读物》小丛书，都是选自中外文学里已有定评的优秀短篇或长篇中的精彩片断，每本都附插图数幅，真可以说是图文并茂。中华书局出版的《古典文学普及读物》小丛书，都是挑选古典文学中具有民主性精华，并且为大众所喜闻乐见的作品。值得一提的是：编者按其作品的形式和内容采取了各种不同的编辑方式：散文被译成白话，和原文对照，诗词戏曲采用浅近的注解。解释说明和翻译所用的文字都做到通俗易懂，尽量做到了口语化、规范化。就是识字不多的人，也能读懂。另外在每册之前，都有对所选作品、作者的简评文字，这对读者阅读、理解、分析作品，大有益处。
    这些文学小丛书的问世，是文学普及工作上的一件好事。它们的内容都是集文学精品之大成；每本又都是字数不多，篇幅不大，随身可带。这对工作很忙，时间有限的人，则是造福不浅，尤其是广大的工农读者更是鼓掌欢迎。读者不仅从书中获得大量的世界文学知识，增加了认识生活的能力，鼓舞了大家建设社会主义新生活的热情，同时，还可以从创作方法和文学艺术技巧上吸取到营养，这对于今天日益旺盛的群众创作运动，是有提高和借鉴作用的。
