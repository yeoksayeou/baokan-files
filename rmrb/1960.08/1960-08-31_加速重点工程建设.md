    Accelerating the Construction of Key Projects

    After carefully studying and discussing the People's Daily editorial "Immediately Launch an Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement Centered on Grain and Steel," our group felt even more keenly the importance and glory of our current construction task: the tractor workshop of the Shenyang Tractor Factory. We are responsible for all the carpentry work in this workshop. The speed with which we complete our task is directly related to how soon this workshop can be put into production. And the sooner this workshop goes into production, the more tractors it can produce for agricultural production.

    The plan we previously set was already a Great Leap Forward plan, with the daily workload completed doubling that of July. However, after studying the People's Daily editorial, we deeply felt that there was still potential to be tapped, and we could completely complete the task even earlier. After detailed discussion, we revised the main indicators such as progress, quality, economy, and safety, and formulated specific guarantee measures.

    Our measures are to adhere to putting politics in command, fully utilize advanced construction machinery and tools, clearly divide labor according to each person's specialty, implement large-scale assembly line operations, carry out pair-up competitions and opponent competitions, and promptly summarize and exchange experiences at pre-shift and post-shift meetings. In addition, while ensuring quality, we will substitute old materials for new ones, and waste materials for finished products, vigorously promote advanced experiences such as rapid demolding methods, accelerate construction progress, and resolutely guarantee the completion of this year's construction tasks in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

    加速重点工程建设
    我们小组认真学习和讨论了人民日报发表的“立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”的社论后，越发感到我们目前担负的沈阳拖拉机厂拖拉机车间施工任务的重要和光荣。我们负责这个车间工程的全部木工活，任务完成得快慢，直接关系这个车间投入生产的迟早，而这个车间早投入生产一天，就能为农业生产出更多的拖拉机来。
    我们过去订的计划已是跃进计划，每天完成的工作量比七月提高了一倍，但是，当我们学习了人民日报的社论以后，深深感到还有潜力可挖，完全可以提前再提前完成任务。经过详细讨论，我们重新修订了进度、质量、节约、安全等几个主要指标，并制订出了具体的保证措施。
    我们的措施是，坚持政治挂帅、充分利用先进施工机械和工具，并且按照每个人的特长进行明确分工，实行大流水作业，开展对口赛和对手赛，在班前班后会上及时总结交流经验。另外，在保证不影响质量的情况下，以旧料代新料，以废料代成材，大力推广快速脱模法等先进经验，加速施工进度，坚决保证多快好省地完成今年的施工任务。
