Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch: The China Political Science and Law Association, in view of the fact that the International Law Association, under the control of certain leaders, disregarding the will of honest legal workers worldwide, betraying basic principles of international law, and persistently following the US imperialism in repeatedly carrying out conspiracies to create "two Chinas," infringe upon Chinese sovereignty, and interfere in Chinese internal affairs, has decided to withdraw from the International Law Association and sever all relations with the International Law Association.

The Vice-President and First Secretary of the Secretariat of the China Political Science and Law Association, Wu Defeng, notified the Chairman of the International Law Association, McNair, and Assistant Secretary Edward of the above decision in a letter of protest on August 1st. He also requested them to distribute the letter to all delegates attending the 49th Conference of the International Law Association.

The International Law Association will hold its 49th Conference in Hamburg starting August 7th. The supplementary circular issued by the Association in May 1960, in the "Visa" column of the list of countries, actually included the words "Republic of China," placing the Chiang Kai-shek clique, long spurned by the Chinese people, alongside the great nation of the People's Republic of China, plotting to create a "two Chinas" situation within the International Law Association. Prior to this, the circular issued by the International Law Association in February 1960 absurdly listed the Tibet region of China as a country. The China Political Science and Law Association believes that the repeated occurrence of these events indicates that the International Law Association, under the control of some of its leaders, is willing to betray the basic principles of international law, openly participate in the conspiracy planned by US imperialism and its followers to infringe upon Chinese sovereignty, interfere in Chinese internal affairs, and openly provoke the Chinese people. In response, the China Political Science and Law Association wrote to the International Law Association on June 30, 1960, to lodge a serious protest.

In its protest letter of June 30, the China Political Science and Law Association solemnly pointed out: "There is only one China in the world, and that is the People's Republic of China. Taiwan is Chinese territory. US imperialism has forcibly occupied Taiwan and, in order to legitimize this occupation, is intensifying its plot to create 'two Chinas,' attempting in international activities to confront the People's Republic of China with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has long been spurned by the Chinese people. The China Political Science and Law Association, together with all the Chinese people, firmly opposes any attempt to create 'two Chinas' in any situation and in any form, and firmly opposes US imperialism's infringement on our territorial sovereignty."

The protest letter solemnly pointed out: "Tibet is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. The Tibetan people are a member of the Chinese people's big family. The imperialists and foreign interventionists' conspiracy to create 'Tibetan independence' and interfere in our internal affairs has long been shattered by all the Chinese people, including the Tibetan people. The International Law Association's continued attempt to turn Tibet into an independent country not only shows that it lacks the most basic common sense, but also fully exposes its deliberate pursuit of the imperialist conspiracy to interfere in China's internal affairs."

The China Political Science and Law Association believes that it is absolutely impermissible for the International Law Association to engage in these activities hostile to the Chinese people. In order to give certain leaders of the International Law Association an opportunity to correct their mistakes in a timely manner, the China Political Science and Law Association requested in its protest letter of June 30 that the International Law Association immediately withdraw all relevant circulars, declare the correction of errors, and guarantee that similar situations would not occur again.

However, in its reply telegram of July 11, the International Law Association not only failed to correct its errors in a timely manner but also put forward the excuse that the International Law Association is a non-political organization, refusing the reasonable demands of the China Political Science and Law Association. The China Political Science and Law Association pointed out in its protest letter of August 1: "This proves that certain leaders of the International Law Association are not avoiding politics, but are only stubbornly adhering to their political stance of following US imperialism in infringing upon Chinese sovereignty, interfering in Chinese internal affairs, and being hostile to the Chinese people."

The China Political Science and Law Association solemnly stated in its protest letter of August 1: "The China Political Science and Law Association, adhering to the purpose of safeguarding peace and promoting the cause of human justice, has always been willing to conduct friendly cooperation with legal workers from various countries. However, we absolutely cannot allow some people to take advantage of our spirit of cooperation to infringe upon our sovereignty and interfere in our internal affairs. In view of the fact that the International Law Association, under the control of certain leaders, disregarding the will of honest legal workers worldwide, betraying basic principles of international law, and persistently following US imperialism in repeatedly carrying out conspiracies to create 'two Chinas,' infringe upon Chinese sovereignty, and interfere in Chinese internal affairs. The China Political Science Law Association has decided to withdraw from the International Law Association and sever all relations with the International Law Association."

### 抗议国际法协会某些领导人追随美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋  我国政法学会决定退出国际法协会  严正宣告：中国只有一个，这就是中华人民共和国

    抗议国际法协会某些领导人追随美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋
    我国政法学会决定退出国际法协会
    严正宣告：中国只有一个，这就是中华人民共和国
    新华社4日讯　中国政治法律学会鉴于国际法协会在某些领导人把持下，不顾世界正直的法律工作者的意志，背弃国际法基本原则，坚持追随美帝国主义一再进行制造“两个中国”、侵犯中国主权、干涉中国内政的阴谋活动，决定退出国际法协会，并且断绝同国际法协会的一切关系。
    中国政治法律学会副会长兼书记处第一书记吴德峰在8月1日给国际法协会主席麦克奈尔和助理秘书艾德华一封抗议信，把上述决定通知了他们。并且要求他们把这封信分发给参加国际法协会第四十九届大会的全体代表。
    国际法协会将于8月7日起在汉堡召开第四十九届大会。该会1960年5月发出的补充通报，在“签证”栏开列的各国名单中，竟然出现“中华民国”字样，把早已被中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团同中国人民的伟大国家中华人民共和国并列在一起，阴谋在国际法协会中制造“两个中国”的局面。在此以前，国际法协会在1960年2月发出的通报，还荒谬地把中国的西藏地区列为一个国家。中国政治法律学会认为：这些事情的一再发生，表明国际法协会在它的某些领导人的把持下，不惜背弃国际法的基本原则，明目张胆地参与美帝国主义及其追随者所策划的侵犯中国主权、干涉中国内政的阴谋，公然对中国人民进行挑衅。对此，中国政治法律学会，曾在1960年6月30日写信给国际法协会，提出严重抗议。
    中国政治法律学会在6月30日的抗议信中严正指出：“世界上只有一个中国，这就是中华人民共和国。台湾是中国的领土。美帝国主义武装霸占了台湾，并且为了使这种霸占合法化，正在变本加厉地策划制造‘两个中国’的阴谋，在国际活动中妄图以早已被中国人民唾弃的蒋介石集团与中华人民共和国对抗。中国政治法律学会和全中国人民一起，坚决反对在任何场合、以任何形式制造‘两个中国’的阴谋，坚决反对美帝国主义侵犯我国领土主权。”
    抗议信严肃指出：“西藏是中国领土的不可分割的一部分。西藏人民是中国人民大家庭的一个成员。帝国主义和外国干涉者妄想制造‘西藏独立’干涉我国内政的阴谋，早已被包括西藏人民在内的全中国人民所粉碎。国际法协会现在仍然还妄想把西藏搞成一个独立国家，不仅表明它缺乏最起码的常识，而且充分暴露它一意追随帝国主义干涉中国内政的阴谋。”
    中国政治法律学会认为，绝对不能容许国际法协会进行这些敌视中国人民的活动。为了给予国际法协会的某些领导人一个及时纠正错误的机会，中国政治法律学会在6月30日的抗议信中要求国际法协会立即撤回所有有关通报，声明改正错误，并保证不再发生类似情况。
    但是，国际法协会在7月11日的复电中，不仅没有及时纠正错误，而且提出国际法协会是非政治性团体的借口，拒绝中国政治法律学会的合理要求。中国政治法律学会在8月1日发出的抗议信中指出：“这就证明国际法协会某些领导人并不是不谈政治，而只是顽固地坚持他们追随美帝侵犯中国主权、干涉中国内政、敌视中国人民的政治立场。”
    中国政治法律学会在8月1日的抗议信中严正声明：“中国政治法律学会本着保卫和平和促进人类正义事业的宗旨，始终愿意同各国法律工作者进行友好合作。但是，我们绝对不能允许有些人利用我们这种合作精神，借机侵犯我国主权、干涉我国内政。鉴于国际法协会在某些领导人把持下，不顾世界正直的法律工作者的意志，背弃国际法基本原则，坚持追随美帝国主义一再进行制造‘两个中国’、侵犯中国主权、干涉中国内政的阴谋活动，中国政治法律学会决定退出国际法协会，并且断绝同国际法协会的一切关系。”
