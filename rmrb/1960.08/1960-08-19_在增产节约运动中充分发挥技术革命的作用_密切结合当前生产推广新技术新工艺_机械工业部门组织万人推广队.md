Xinhua News Agency News: The First Ministry of Machine Building, the National Committee of the First National Machine Building Trade Union, and the Mechanical Engineering Society and other units jointly organized a large-scale "10,000-Person Relay Promotion Team" to promote the major advanced technologies and experiences emerging from the technological revolution in various regions, in order to push the technological innovation and technological revolution movement of the machine building industry to a new stage that is more extensive, more in-depth, and more closely integrated with current production. Currently, the advance force of the promotion team has set off for eighteen provinces and cities including Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, and Shanghai, and is penetrating the front lines of production.

The "10,000-Person Relay Promotion Team" consists of an advance force and a relay force, and is organized into twenty-three groups based on products as their work object. The participants in the advance force include cadres drawn from the direct units of the First Ministry of Machine Building in Beijing and the National Committee of the First National Machine Building Trade Union, as well as more than two hundred advanced producers and veteran workers. After they arrive in various locations, they will converge with the relay teams from the mechanical departments, mechanical trade unions, and mechanical engineering societies of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions to further expand the organization, and then penetrate into enterprises, absorbing advanced experience creators and veteran workers in the enterprises to work together.

The main tasks of the 10,000-Person Relay Promotion Team are to closely integrate with the needs of current production and extensively and deeply promote a large number of new product structures, advanced processes, and advanced technologies that have emerged in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, such as new product structures for various new pumps, new air compressors, and new crushers, and advanced processes such as chipless machining, less-chip machining, sandless molding, less-sand molding, arc-light-free welding, and less-arc-light welding. They will promote whatever the enterprises need in production, and they will focus their efforts wherever there are difficulties. For example, currently, in the production of mining machinery, the processing capacity of large parts and gears cannot meet the needs, so the "10,000-Person Relay Promotion Team" has specifically organized forces to promote various advanced "small-scale production of large outputs" processes and the manufacturing technology of "circular arc gears"; the main problem in the production of rolling mills is that the supply of large blanks cannot meet the demand, so the promotion team is concentrating its efforts on promoting the advanced experience of "electroslag welding" to help enterprises actively increase the production of large blanks. Because each promotion team is equipped with personnel familiar with production, technology, management, scientific research, and other aspects, after the promotion team arrives at the enterprise, it can not only help the enterprise solve technical problems, but also help the enterprise solve a series of problems arising from the adoption of advanced processes and advanced technologies in production, management, and scientific research. Moreover, when promoting advanced experience, members of the promotion team can also participate in operations.

In order to facilitate unified command of the activities of each group, the "10,000-Person Relay Promotion Team" has also set up liaison stations in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, Taiyuan and other places.

    在增产节约运动中充分发挥技术革命的作用
    密切结合当前生产推广新技术新工艺
    机械工业部门组织万人推广队
    新华社讯　第一机械工业部、第一机械工会全国委员会和机械工程学会等单位联合组织了大规模的“万人接力推广队”，到各地推广技术革命中出现的重大的先进技术和经验，以便把机械工业的技术革新和技术革命运动，推上一个更广泛、更深入、更密切结合当前生产的新阶段。现在，推广队的先头部队已经开赴辽宁、黑龙江、山西、上海等十八个省市，深入到生产第一线。
    “万人接力推广队”由先头部队和接力部队组成，以产品为工作对象，共编成二十三个组。参加先头部队的，有第一机械工业部在北京的直属单位和第一机械工会全国委员会抽调的干部，以及二百多个先进生产者和老工人。他们到达各个地方后，将汇合各省、市、自治区机械厅局、机械工会、机械工程学会的接力队伍，进一步扩大组织，然后再深入企业，吸收企业里先进经验创造者、老工人共同进行工作。
    万人接力推广队的主要任务是，密切结合当前生产的需要，广泛深入地推广技术革新和技术革命运动中出现的大量新型产品结构、先进工艺和先进技术，如各种新型水泵、新型空气压缩机、新型破碎机等新产品结构和无切削加工、少切削加工、无砂造型、少砂造型、无弧光焊接、少弧光焊接等先进工艺。各企业生产上需要什么他们就推广什么，哪里有困难就往哪里使劲。例如，当前矿山机械的生产当中，大件加工和齿轮加工的能力还不能满足需要，“万人接力推广队”便专门组织了力量，分别推广各种“以小干大”的先进工艺和“圆弧齿轮”的制造技术；轧钢机生产中的主要问题是大型毛胚供不应求，推广队就集中力量推广“电渣焊”的先进经验，帮助企业积极增产大型毛胚。由于每个推广队都配备了熟悉生产、技术、管理、科学研究等各方面的人员，所以推广队到企业后，不仅能帮助企业解决技术问题，还能帮助企业解决由于采用先进工艺、先进技术在生产、管理、科学研究等方面产生的一系列问题。而且，在推广先进经验的时候，推广队的成员还能够动手参加操作。
    为了便于统一指挥每个组的活动，“万人接力推广队”还在北京、上海、沈阳、武汉、太原等地设立了联络站。
