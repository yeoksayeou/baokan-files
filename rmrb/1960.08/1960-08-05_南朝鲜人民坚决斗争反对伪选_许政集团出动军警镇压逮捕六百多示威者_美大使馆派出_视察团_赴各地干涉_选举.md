Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th. News from Seoul: For days, the South Korean people have continued to wage a tenacious struggle against the sham "National Assembly election" orchestrated by reactionary upper echelons of the "Democratic Party" and other traitorous politicians under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism.

Since the farce of the July 29 "National Assembly election," the South Korean people have launched large-scale demonstrations in various locations to protest the deceptive and fraudulent practices of the reactionary upper echelons of the "Democratic Party" and their suppression of the people, opposing the participation of Syngman Rhee's "Liberal Party" members in the "election" in order to stage a comeback. Angry masses destroyed polling stations in many places, burned ballot boxes, and shouted slogans such as "Another Liberal Party-style election has emerged" and demanding "Declare the election invalid" and "Hold a new election." Demonstrators also shouted slogans such as "Down with the counter-revolutionaries." Mass demonstrations broke out in dozens of places including Seoul, Masan, Busan, Daejeon, Daegu, Samcheonpo, and Goseong. Because demonstrators burned ballot boxes, some places had to hold "elections" again.

Yesterday in Seoul, two hundred demonstrators from Hongcheon fought with three hundred police suppressing them. According to news from August 2nd, in Goseong, thirty thousand demonstrators, including women, surrounded the police station, demanding the replacement of "Liberal Party" candidates and the release of those arrested. Near Daegu, more than fifteen hundred demonstrators surrounded the pseudo-county office and police station, protesting the fraudulent practices of "Democratic Party" candidates. In Samcheonpo, where more than two thousand people had demonstrated against the "election" farce on the 29th, five thousand demonstrators protested again on the evening of July 31 against pro-Syngman Rhee elements participating in bribery and vote-buying. On August 2nd, demonstrations occurred again in Seoul and Goryeong, southeast of Seoul. More than one thousand demonstrators in Goryeong protested to the Goryeong "Police Station," opposing the reactionary upper echelons of the "Democratic Party" using fraudulent means such as casting fake ballots in the "election." Demonstrations of over one thousand people broke out in Namwon and Goesan. In Yangseong, North Chungcheong Province, a large-scale demonstration broke out on July 31 and spread to the entire Yangseong County by August 1. Hundreds of students and citizens in Hongcheon, Goseong, Yeongyang, Namwon, and other places held demonstrations, demanding that the police release the arrested demonstrators.

In the face of the popular uprising in various parts of South Korea, U.S. imperialism and the Heo Jeong group were thrown into disarray and frantically suppressed the South Korean people, arresting innocent masses on a large scale. According to the obviously reduced figures released by the South Korean police authorities, by noon on August 2, more than six hundred demonstrators had been arrested in various locations. In Changnyeong alone, one hundred and thirty-five residents were arrested. The puppet authorities dispatched large numbers of police to suppress demonstrators in various places, and many people were injured. In Daejeon, Namwon, and Changnyeong, the pseudo-army was also dispatched to carry out suppression. In Namwon, the army used tear gas to disperse demonstrators. However, the masses were not intimidated by these repressive measures and continued their struggle. Agence France-Presse reported that the "situation in South Korea remains tense."

This "election" farce was carried out under the direct interference of the United States. In order to support its loyal lackeys in coming to power and maintain its colonial rule in South Korea, the United States did not hesitate to come forward in person this time. The U.S. "Embassy" openly sent "inspection teams" to various locations to "inspect" "election" preparations and the "election itself." The U.S. tool, the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," also sent many "inspection teams" to various locations to "inspect." The chairman of this commission in July, Arreglado (Philippine "Ambassador" to South Korea), even issued a statement on July 31 saying that, in his view, the "election" was "held in a free and fair manner."

    南朝鲜人民坚决斗争反对伪选
    许政集团出动军警镇压逮捕六百多示威者
    美大使馆派出“视察团”赴各地干涉“选举”
    据新华社平壤4日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜人民几天来继续顽强地展开反对在美帝国主义操纵下“民主党”反动上层等卖国政客所串演的伪“国会选举”的斗争。
    自从7月29日“国会选举”丑剧上演以后，几天以来南朝鲜人民在各地纷纷举行大规模示威，抗议“民主党”反动上层的欺骗舞弊行为和对人民的镇压，反对李承晚的“自由党”党徒参加“竞选”以便卷土重来。愤怒的群众捣毁了许多地方的投票所，焚烧了投票箱，高呼“又出现了自由党式的选举”，要求“宣布选举无效”、“重新举行选举”等口号。示威群众也喊出了“打倒反革命”的口号。在汉城、马山、釜山、大田、大丘、三千浦、高城等几十个地方都爆发了群众示威。由于示威群众烧毁了投票箱，有的地方不得不重新进行“选举”。
    昨天在汉城，有来自洪川的二百名示威者同镇压他们的三百名警察搏斗。据8月2日的消息说，在高城，包括妇女在内的三万名示威者包围了警察署，要求撤换“自由党”候选人和释放被捕的人。在大丘附近有一千五百多示威者包围了伪郡办公署和警察署，抗议“民主党”候选人作弊。在29日曾经举行二千多人反“选举”丑剧示威的三千浦，7月31日晚上又有五千名示威者，抗议亲李承晚分子参加贿选。8月2日，在汉城和汉城东南的高灵也再次发生示威。高灵的一千多名示威者向高灵“警察署”抗议，反对“民主党”反动上层在“选举”中使用投假票等作弊手段。在南原、槐山等地都爆发了千人以上的示威。在忠清北道的阳城，7月31日爆发大规模示威，到8月1日已扩及阳城郡全境。洪川、固城、英阳、南原等地都有成百名的学生和市民举行示威，要求警察释放被逮捕的示威群众。
    在南朝鲜各地人民群起斗争的形势下，美帝国主义和许政集团手忙脚乱，对南朝鲜人民疯狂镇压，大肆逮捕无辜群众。据南朝鲜警察当局公布的显然缩小的数字，到8月2日中午为止，在各地已逮捕了六百多名示威者。仅在昌宁一地就逮捕了一百三十五名居民。傀儡当局在各地出动了大批警察镇压示威群众，有多人受伤。在大田、南原和昌宁等地并且出动了伪军进行镇压。在南原，军队使用了催泪瓦斯来驱散示威群众。但是，群众并没有被这些镇压措施所吓倒，仍然在继续进行斗争。法新社的消息说南朝鲜的“局势仍然很紧张”。
    这次“选举”丑剧是在美国直接的干涉下进行的。美国为了扶持它的忠实的走狗上台以维持它在南朝鲜的殖民统治，这一次不惜亲自出马，美国“大使馆”公开派出“视察团”到各地“视察”“选举”准备情况和“选举本身”。美国的御用工具“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”也派了许多“视察团”到各地“视察”。这个委员会7月份的主席阿雷格拉多（菲律宾驻南朝鲜“大使”）在7月31日居然发表声明说：在他看来，这次“选举”“是以自由和公正的方式举行的”。
