    Focusing on Second and Third-Class Seedlings, Prioritizing Topdressing and Pest Control
    Dahu Production Team Discusses Overproduction Plan and Sets Out Measures to Increase Production
    90% of Labor Force Invested in Field Management, Everyone Full of Enthusiasm, Ushering in a New Upsurge of Production
    (Our dispatch) Under the call of the Party to "immediately launch a production increase and conservation campaign centered on grain and steel," all members of the Dahu Production Team of Chengguan People's Commune in Zou County, Shandong Province, have launched a new upsurge in vigorously promoting grain production.
    Since August 10th, the team has been organizing manpower to inspect the growth of autumn crops on each plot of land to further identify the key to increasing production, while mobilizing members to examine the implementation of the production increase plan for the first seven and a half months, and discuss measures to increase production in the coming month. The inspection results show that the team's production plan for the first seven and a half months of this year has been completed relatively well. In the discussion, everyone realized that the current period is the peak growing season for late autumn crops, and that as long as measures are intensified to promote their growth and reduce the harm of natural disasters, overproduction is possible. In order to carry out the overproduction campaign in depth, the team's Party branch, in addition to making great efforts to explain the importance of taking grain as the key link and carrying out the overproduction campaign in mass activity places such as fields and canteens, also used the experience and lessons learned from the significant differences in production increase effects due to different management in the previous stage of production, to explain that as long as they go all out and intensify measures, they can achieve overproduction. For example, the first team's wheat was originally contracted to produce 197 jin per mu. Due to strengthened management, 45 jin of chemical fertilizer were applied to each mu of 200 mu of third-class seedlings, and watered four times, with an actual yield of 208 jin and 10 liang per mu, winning an overproduction reward. Through these examples, the vast number of members further recognized the current situation and put more effort into the overproduction campaign.
    In order to ensure that this movement is carried out in a solid and powerful manner, focusing on key crops and identifying key measures, the brigade organized cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers to inspect and rank the late autumn crops plot by plot, and formulated overproduction targets and measures for each, deciding to focus on second and third-class seedlings, with topdressing and pest control as the main measures, concentrating 90% of the labor force on field management, and striving for actual production exceeding contracted production. The team has a total of 335.5 mu of spring and summer sweet potatoes, of which 130 mu are first-class seedlings, and it was decided to apply another 50 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu, turn the vines and cultivate the soil in a timely manner, and strengthen management; 178.5 mu are second-class seedlings, and it was decided to apply another 70 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu, and another 1 jin of manure soup per plant; 27 mu are third-class seedlings, and it was decided to apply another 100 jin of nitrogen-fixing bacteria fertilizer per mu, and pour 2 jin of manure soup per plant. The team has 149.5 mu of soybeans, of which 55 mu are second-class seedlings and 30 mu are third-class seedlings. In addition to comprehensively strengthening management, the third-class seedlings will be topdressed with another 200 jin of manure per mu and hoed twice before the end of August. Specific production increase plans have also been formulated for vegetable management.
    In order to realize the above measures and solve the contradiction between the current autumn field topdressing and autumn planting fertilizer, the team actively launched a campaign in which everyone participated and every household accumulated fertilizer, and has now prepared 13,000 jin of bacterial fertilizer and a large amount of manure fertilizer to supply autumn field topdressing, and has also prepared a large amount of fertilizer for autumn planting. In order to concentrate labor to strengthen the front line, the team also extracted 49 people from sideline production and collective welfare undertakings to invest in field management, ensuring that more than 90% of the labor force participated in agriculture. Team member Hu Zhengxi saw that the double-row close planting of sweet potatoes this year was carefully managed, and proposed that women turn the vines and male laborers hoe the ridges, which would not only manage them carefully but also hoe well, and the work efficiency would also increase from 1.5 mu per day to 2 mu. Team member Chen Fenglong saw that one person hoeing and one person turning the vine nests was inefficient, and suggested changing it to two people turning the vines and one person hoeing. The canteen cooks also actively contributed to the overproduction campaign, proposing that wherever the members work, water and food should be supplied there. Female cook Li Qingrong traveled three Chinese miles back and forth to deliver water to the members, several times a day.
    From August 10th to 20th, in ten days, the 335 mu of spring and summer sweet potatoes in this production team have been topdressed once, and the 80 mu of second and third-class wheat stubble sweet potatoes have been watered with manure soup once. The bean pod borers and pentatomids on the soybeans have also been continuously treated twice, all of which have been eliminated; the weeds on the 75 mu of vegetables have also been pulled twice. The vast number of members have unlimited confidence in realizing the overproduction plan. (Attached picture)

    以二、三类苗为主要对象　以追肥治虫为主要措施
    大胡生产队讨论超产计划订出增产措施
    90％劳力投入田间管理，人人干劲十足，掀起生产新高潮
    本报讯　山东邹县城关人民公社大胡生产队全体社员，在党的“立即开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”的号召下，掀起了大抓粮食生产的新高潮。
    自8月10日以来，这个队就一面组织力量逐块土地检查秋田作物生长情况，进一步找增产的关键；一面发动社员检查前七个半月增产计划执行的情况，讨论今后一个月的增产措施。从检查的结果看，这个队今年前七个半月的生产计划完成情况较好。在讨论中，大家认识到当前正是晚秋作物的盛长时期，只要加大措施，促其增实鼓粒，缩小自然灾害的危害，就有超产的可能。这个队的党支部，为了深入开展超产运动，除利用田间、食堂等群众活动场所，大讲以粮为纲，大搞超产运动的重要意义以外，并以前段生产中因管理不同，增产效果悬殊的经验教训，说明了只要鼓足干劲，加大措施，就能实现超产的道理。例如第一队的小麦，原每亩包产一百九十七斤。由于加强管理，将二百亩三类苗每亩追化肥四十五斤，浇了四次水，每亩实产二百零八斤十两，获得了超产奖励。通过这些实例，使广大社员进一步认清了当前形势，用更大的干劲投入了超产运动。
    为了使这一运动开展得踏实有力，抓住关键作物，找出关键措施，大队组织干部、技术员、老农等对晚秋作物逐块进行了检查排队，分别订出了超产指标和措施，决定以二、三类苗为主要对象，以追肥、治虫为主要措施，把90％的劳力集中于田间管理，争取实产超包产。全队共有春夏甘薯三百三十五亩半，其中一类苗一百三十亩，决定每亩再追五十斤化肥，及时翻秧、培土，加强管理；二类苗一百七十八亩半，决定每亩再追七十斤化肥，每棵再追一斤大粪汤；三类苗二十七亩，决定每亩再追一百斤固氮菌肥，每棵浇二斤大粪汤。全队有大豆一百四十九亩半，其中二类苗五十五亩、三类苗三十亩，除全面加强管理外，对三类苗在8月底前，每亩再追二百斤大粪，锄两遍。对蔬菜管理也订出了具体增产计划。
    为了实现上述措施和解决当前秋田追肥和秋种用肥的矛盾，全队积极开展了一个人人动手、户户积肥的突击运动，现已备好菌肥一万三千斤和大量粪肥，供应秋田追肥用，还为秋种准备了大量肥料。为了集中劳力加强第一线，全队又从副业生产、集体福利事业中抽出四十九人，投入田间管理，保证参加农业的劳力达到了90％以上。社员胡正喜看到今年甘薯双行密植管理得细，就提出要妇女翻秧，男劳力锄垅，既管得细，又锄得好，工效也由每天锄一亩半提高到二亩。社员陈风龙看到一人锄地一人翻秧窝工，就建议改为二人翻秧一人锄。食堂炊事人员也积极为超产运动加劲，提出社员劳动到哪里，水饭就供应到哪里。女炊事员李庆荣来回三华里给社员送水，一天送好几趟。
    从8月10日到20日十天中，这个生产队三百三十五亩春夏甘薯，已普追一遍肥，八十亩二、三类苗的麦茬甘薯，都浇了一遍大粪汤。对大豆造桥虫、五色虫也连续普治了两遍，全部消灭；七十五亩蔬菜也拔了两遍草。广大社员对实现超产计划怀着无限信心。（附图片）
