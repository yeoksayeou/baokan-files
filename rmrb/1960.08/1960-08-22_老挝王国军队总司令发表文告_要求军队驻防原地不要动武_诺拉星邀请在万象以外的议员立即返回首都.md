Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 21st: Vientiane Radio broadcast on the 20th that Van Ratikone, who has resumed his position as Commander-in-Chief of the Lao Kingdom Army, issued a proclamation to the Kingdom's armed forces stating, "I call on the commanders of all military regions and branches to keep their troops stationed in place while awaiting my orders. It is forbidden to concentrate troops." He demanded that the Kingdom Army "effectively implement the government's statement."

Ratikone also appealed to the Kingdom's army not to use force against each other and to consider the security and order of the country.

Ratikone recounted the process of his resumption of the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Kingdom's Army. He said that after the coup in Vientiane on August 9, he was sent back to Vientiane by the former government as Commander-in-Chief of the Kingdom Army to negotiate. However, no understanding was reached between the two sides, so he resigned on August 15. However, the new government and the coup committee did not agree to his request and reappointed him as Commander-in-Chief of the Kingdom Army.

He also notified commanders at all levels and all soldiers that the Chairman of the coup committee, Kong Le, had been appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Kingdom Army.

According to Vientiane Radio's broadcast on the evening of August 20, the Speaker of the Lao National Assembly, Phoumi Nhorarath, invited assembly members outside Vientiane via radio on the 19th to return to Vientiane immediately to carry out their duties as representatives of the party. He said that their safety upon their return was guaranteed.

Nhorarath also said, "In the name of the Speaker of the National Assembly, I assure you that the assembly members in Vientiane have not been threatened in any way. On the contrary, the former Speaker of the National Assembly and the assembly members in Vientiane have been well protected by the coup committee, and it is not true, as rumored, that some assembly members have been imprisoned."

According to Vientiane Radio, the Deputy Minister of National Defense of the Lao Kingdom, Quinim Pholsena, issued a statement to the entire nation on the 20th, calling on officers, soldiers, and all people of the Kingdom Army at all levels not to kill each other. He said that killing each other "should not be done and is not in accordance with the wishes of all the people."

    老挝王国军队总司令发表文告
    要求军队驻防原地不要动武
    诺拉星邀请在万象以外的议员立即返回首都
    新华社河内21日电　据万象电台20日广播，重新担任老挝王国军队总司令的万·拉迪功向王国军队发表文告说，
  “我呼吁各军区、各兵种指挥官在听候我的命令期间，把自己的部队驻在原地。禁止把军队集中起来”。他要求王国军队“有效地实现政府的声明”。
    拉迪功还呼吁王国军队不要互相使用武力，大家要为祖国的安全和秩序着想。
    拉迪功叙述了他重新担任王国军队总司令的经过。他说，8月9日在万象发动政变以后，他以王国军队总司令的身份被前政府派回万象谈判。但双方未取得谅解，所以他在8月15日提出辞职。但是，新政府和政变委员会没有答应他的要求，并且重新任命他为王国军队总司令。
    他还通知各级指挥官和全体士兵说，政变委员会主席贡勒已被任命为王国军队副总司令。
    据万象电台20日晚上广播，老挝国民议会议长布文·诺拉星在19日通过广播电台邀请在万象以外的议员马上回到万象，以执行他们作为政党代表的任务。他说，他们回来后的安全是有保障的。
    诺拉星还说，“我以国民议会议长名义向你们保证，在万象的议员没有受到任何威胁，相反的，前国民议会议长和在万象的议员都得到政变委员会的很好的保卫，绝不像流言中所说的某些议员受到监禁。”
    据万象电台广播，老挝王国国防副大臣文翁·詹巴萨克20日在告全民书中，呼吁王国军队各级军官、士兵和全体人民不要互相残杀。他说，互相残杀“是不应该的，而且是不符合全体人民的愿望的。”
