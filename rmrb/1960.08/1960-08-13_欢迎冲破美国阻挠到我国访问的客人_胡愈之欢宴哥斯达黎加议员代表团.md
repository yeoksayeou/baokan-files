    Xinhua News Agency, August 12th: Hu Yuzhi, Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and his wife held a banquet this evening to warmly welcome the Costa Rican Parliamentary Delegation visiting our country.

    The delegation of twelve, invited by the Foreign Affairs Institute, arrived in Beijing by plane this morning. The delegation includes: Member of Parliament Marcial Aguiluz and his wife, José Rafael Cordero and his wife, Noel Hernández and his wife, Néstor López Gutiérrez, José Ángel Haro, César O. Solano, and journalist Julio César Turnor.

    Hu Yuzhi delivered a speech at the banquet. He expressed respect to the Costa Rican guests for their resolute struggle against the obstruction of American imperialism and finally coming to visit our country, and extended a warm welcome to them. Hu Yuzhi expressed his belief that their visit will promote understanding and friendship between the people of China and Costa Rica.

    Hu Yuzhi pointed out that the people of China and Costa Rica, and the people of all countries in the world, hope for friendly cooperation and mutual exchanges, and only imperialism, headed by the United States, is destroying peace and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries everywhere. He said that as long as the people of all countries unite and fight, they will surely be able to smash the conspiracies of imperialism. He said that the heroic struggle of the people of Cuba and other Latin American countries against American imperialism has greatly encouraged the Chinese people, and the Chinese people firmly support their struggle.

    Hu Yuzhi expressed the hope that the people of China and Costa Rica will further support and learn from each other in the struggle to build their own countries, oppose the common enemy of American imperialism, and defend world peace.

    Hernández, on behalf of the Costa Rican Parliamentary Delegation, thanked the Chinese people for their warm reception. He said that although there are significant differences between Costa Rica's population and area and those of China, this does not prevent the people of our two countries from having common aspirations and tasks. He said, "Our visit to China to understand China's tremendous changes and achievements in economic and cultural construction will be of great benefit to us."

    Also present at the banquet were Zhang Su, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Deputy Secretaries-General Yu Xinqing and Lian Guan, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Sun Xiaocun, Vice President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association Zhou Erfu, member of the Presidium of the National Women's Federation Cao Mengjun, and other well-known people from relevant fields.
