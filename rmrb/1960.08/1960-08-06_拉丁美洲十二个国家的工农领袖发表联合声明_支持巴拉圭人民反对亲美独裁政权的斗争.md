Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 4th: Labor and peasant leaders from more than ten Latin American countries issued a joint statement supporting the Paraguayan people's struggle against the pro-American dictatorial regime.

The joint statement was signed by twenty-five labor and peasant leaders from Brazil, Venezuela, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, Peru, Costa Rica, Honduras, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Cuba. They recently held a meeting in Havana to support the struggle of the Paraguayan people.

The joint statement, published in Cuban newspapers today, said that Paraguay is increasingly under the rule of imperialism. The Stroessner dictatorial regime has handed over the Chaco region of Paraguay to U.S. imperialism, where missile launch bases are being built.

The statement expressed firm support for the Paraguayan people's anti-tyranny struggle, supported the National Liberation United Front's heroic struggle against the Stroessner rule, and condemned the dictatorial regime's barbaric crimes against the people, especially against the guerrillas.

    新华社哈瓦那4日电　拉丁美洲十多个国家的工人和农民领袖发表联合声明，支持巴拉圭人民反对亲美独裁政权的斗争。
    签署这项联合声明的是巴西、委内瑞拉、智利、乌拉圭、阿根廷、巴拉圭、秘鲁、哥斯达黎加、洪都拉斯、厄瓜多尔、玻利维亚和古巴的二十五位工人和农民领袖。他们最近在哈瓦那举行了支持巴拉圭人民斗争的会议。
    今天发表在古巴报纸上的这项联合声明说，巴拉圭受帝国主义的统治愈来愈深了。斯特罗斯纳独裁政权已经把巴拉圭的查科地区交给了美帝国主义，在那里正在建造导弹发射基地。
    声明表示坚决支持巴拉圭人民进行的反暴政的斗争，支持民族解放联合阵线进行反对斯特罗斯纳统治的英勇斗争，并且谴责独裁政权对人民特别是对游击队员犯下的野蛮罪行。
