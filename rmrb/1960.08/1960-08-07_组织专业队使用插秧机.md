Organizing Professional Teams to Use Rice Transplanters
    Li Yonggeng Wang Huamin Shi Zuoshuai
    In the upsurge of agricultural tool reform centered on rice transplanters across Fujian, experiences in managing and using rice transplanters have been created. Promoting these experiences has played a positive role in improving the efficiency of rice transplanters and extending their service life.
    Taining County piloted the establishment of a rice transplanter station in Zhukou Commune, concentrating all the commune's fifteen brigades' rice transplanters and skilled workers who could repair and use them at the station. Due to the centralized use of rice transplanters and transplanters, the promotion of rice transplanters has been done very well. After this experience was promoted throughout the county, a total of thirty-one rice transplanter stations were established. Each station implemented a "one leader, three staff" system and "four unifieds." "One leader, three staff" means: the station chief is the commune party secretary, brigade branch secretary, or brigade leader, and under him are a tutor, a technician, and a repairman.
  "Four unifieds" means: technicians are uniformly transferred, rice transplanters are used uniformly, land is planned uniformly, and transplanting time is uniformly arranged. This has had very good results. Ten days after the establishment of stations throughout the county, the utilization rate of rice transplanters increased from 50% to 75%, the daily transplanting efficiency of each rice transplanter increased three to four times, and the missing seedling rate also decreased from 3% to 0.4%. Another example is Ningde County, which established a professional rice transplanter team. The team then established field cultivation stations. Each rice transplanter team is equipped with five to six rice transplanters, each machine has two operators, a main and a secondary, and is equipped with simple repair kits (containing tools and assembly parts), so that each machine is used for its specific purpose, repairs are done in the field, and repair and use are combined. From the results of practice, the establishment of professional teams has four major benefits: ① it is convenient to learn from each other, exchange experiences, and carry out competitions; ② it is convenient to be familiar with the performance of the machines; ③ repairs can be done at any time; ④ it facilitates joint operations and machine management.
    In order to consolidate and expand the achievements of the rice transplanter professional teams, these two counties also adopted the methods of "three guarantees," "six fixes," and "one reward." "Three guarantees" means: guarantee repair, guarantee management, and guarantee use; "Six fixes" means: fix personnel, fix work points, fix machines (two people per machine), fix fields (fixing one machine to transplant three to four mu per day), fix quality, and fix time tasks; "One reward" is a reward of 30% for those who exceed the quota. In general, the establishment of rice transplanter professional teams is an advanced organizational form for the large-scale promotion of rice transplanters, which can achieve a match between machines and people, a combination of repair and use, making the best use of people's talents and maximizing the use of machines.

    组织专业队使用插秧机	李永耿　王华民　施作帅
    福建各地在以插秧机为中心的农具改革运动高潮中，创造了管理使用插秧机的经验。推广这些经验，对提高插秧机工效，延长插秧机使用寿命，都起到了良好的作用。
    泰宁县在朱口公社试建了插秧机站，把全社十五个大队的插秧机和会修配会使用插秧机的能手都集中到站里来。由于集中使用插秧机和插秧手，插秧机推广工作做得很好。这一经验在全县推广后，全县共建立三十一个插秧机站。每个站都实行“一长三员制”和“四统一”。“一长三员”就是：由公社党委书记、大队支部书记或大队长任站长，下设辅导员、技术员、修配员。
  “四统一”就是：技术员统一抽调，插秧机统一使用，土地统一规划，插秧时间统一安排。这样做效果很好。全县建站十天后，插秧机使用率由50％提高到75％，每部插秧机的日插工效提高三、四倍，缺兜浮秧率也从3％下降到0.4％。又如宁德县成立专业插秧机队，队又成立田间耕作站，每个插秧机队配有五至六部插秧机，每机有正副机手两人，并配有简易的检修袋（内有工具，装配零件），做到专机专用，修理到田，修用合一。从实践结果来看，建立专业队有四大好处：①便于互相学习，交流经验，开展竞赛；②专机专用，便于熟悉机具性能；③可以随坏随修；④便于联片作业和机具管理。
    这两个县为巩固和扩大插秧机专业队的成果，还采取了“三包”“六定”“一奖”的办法。“三包”即：包修、包管、包用；“六定”即：定人、定工分、定机（二人一机）定田（定一机日插三一四亩）、定质量、定时间任务；“一奖”是超额者奖30％。总的说来，成立插秧机专业队，是大量推广插秧机的先进组织形式，这样能达到机、人搭配，修用合一，人尽其能，机尽其用。
