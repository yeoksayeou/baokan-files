Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th: U.S. State Department spokesman White issued a statement on August 8 regarding the Cuban government's nationalization of U.S. companies. In the statement, White reiterated the U.S. government's "protest" made to the Cuban government on July 16 and attacked the Cuban government, saying that the law it was based on when taking this action was "arbitrary." White said that the U.S. government had instructed its ambassador to Cuba to submit a so-called "protest" note to the Cuban government.

    At the same time, within the American ruling clique, there has once again been a hysterical outcry for intensified interference in Cuba. According to United Press International, U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee members Gore and Hickenlooper, in statements to reporters on the 7th, openly advocated that the United States use the Organization of American States to "fight" against the Cuban government, and believed that this Pan-American organization was the best tool for the United States to instigate "actions against Castro." Gore expressed "gratification" at the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization of American States members under U.S. manipulation, and he clamored to put together a "hemispheric front" to "accelerate the collapse of the Castro government." Hickenlooper advocated that the United States take "more powerful" means through the Organization of American States to further interfere in Cuba.

    美国无理“抗议”古巴没收美企业
    一些议员叫嚷同古巴政府战斗
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人怀特8日就古巴政府把美国公司收归国有的行动发表一项声明。怀特在声明中重申美国政府在7月16日向古巴政府提出的“抗议”并且攻击古巴政府采取这一行动时所依据的法律是“专横的”。怀特说，美国政府已经指令它的驻古巴大使向古巴政府提出所谓“抗议”照会。
    同时，在美国统治集团中再一次发出了加紧干涉古巴的歇斯底里叫嚣。据合众国际社报道，美国参议院外交委员会委员戈尔和希肯鲁普在7日向记者发表谈话时，公开鼓吹美国通过美洲国家组织来同古巴政府“战斗”，并且认为这个泛美机构是美国用来策动“反对卡斯特罗的行动的最好的工具”。戈尔对在美国操纵下即将召开美洲国家组织成员国外长会议一事表示“庆幸”，他叫嚣要拼凑一个“半球阵线”，来“加快卡斯特罗政府的垮台”。希肯鲁普则鼓吹美国通过美洲国家组织采取“更加有力的”手段来进一步干涉古巴。
