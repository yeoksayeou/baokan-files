Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 22nd. After all sectors of Houma City, Shanxi Province, supported agriculture and large quantities of agricultural machinery were transported to the countryside, the Party committees at all levels attached great importance to fully exploiting the efficiency of various machines and improving the utilization rate of agricultural machinery. They believed that doing a good job in this area was one of the keys to accelerating agricultural technological transformation and solving the problem of insufficient rural labor. Therefore, the secretaries of the Party committees at the city, commune, and management district levels were specifically in charge of this work, and they formulated agricultural machinery management archives and various systems for maintenance, operation, and technical personnel training. A complete agricultural machinery repair network was established throughout the city to ensure that all agricultural machinery was used well, maintained well, and repaired promptly when problems arose.

Currently, in the city’s seventeen people's communes and more than one hundred and seventy management districts, one hundred and sixty-four standard tractors, one thousand and forty-seven sets of irrigation and drainage machinery, and twelve combine harvesters have been largely utilized in a comprehensive manner. According to statistics from January to July, tractors averaged 9,395 cultivated mu per standard unit, exceeding the national requirement by 21.2%. Compared with the same period last year, this is an increase of 101.4%. Cultivation costs were reduced by 30% compared to 0.7 yuan last year. From January to July, irrigation and drainage machinery irrigated more than 232,000 mu, averaging 25 mu per horsepower, an increase of 112.6% compared to 10.5 mu last year. At the same time, the No. 0348 tractor achieved "1,000 days of safety without accidents, 10,000 hours of production without major repairs." The Quwo Electromechanical Station's Rete 25K-55 locomotive completed 24,990 cultivated mu per standard unit, the Quanchang Electromechanical Station completed 22,830 cultivated mu per standard unit, and the Songguo Mechanical Irrigation Station created a new record of irrigating an average of 92 mu per horsepower.

The reason why agricultural machinery in Houma City can be fully utilized is primarily due to the strengthening of political and ideological education and the active training of technical personnel. Comrade Geng Buqing, the secretary of the municipal Party committee, is specifically in charge of this work, and secretaries at all levels of communes and districts are taking the lead. At the beginning of each year, the city conducts an evaluation, training, and rectification of all machine operators and cadres. Each commune's electromechanical station conducts training and inspections of machine operators every quarter. The locomotive teams are rectified every ten days, lined up every five days, and inspected every other day. The city frequently holds training classes and adopts methods such as sending machine operators to study elsewhere and having masters train apprentices to cultivate technical personnel. In recent years, the city has cultivated a technical team of 3,352 people. These technical personnel not only master driving, maintenance, and general repair techniques, but also adhere to political leadership, establish the idea of cherishing machinery, and strengthen their sense of responsibility.

Secondly, a regular maintenance system has been established, and "Machinery Use and Management System" and "Tractor Maintenance Manual" have been formulated. For each machine arriving at each electromechanical station, an archive is immediately established, and a "Maintenance Cycle Chart" is formulated. Based on the age of the machine and the common faults of each machine, the length of usage time, the type of maintenance, and the time for inspection are specified. Three types of cards are implemented for machine operators: one is a "Safety Education Card." In order to prevent personal and machine accidents, when violations of driving regulations are discovered, education is immediately conducted and recorded on the card as a basis for year-end evaluation and promotion. Another is an "Attendance Appraisal Card." Before a locomotive goes out to work, if there are problems such as inadequate protection, insufficient inspection, insufficient temperature, inadequate lighting, insufficient fuel, or unclean oil and water, the inspectors record it on the card as a condition for regular evaluation and take timely measures to correct it before allowing it to go out to work. Another is a "Maintenance Acceptance Card." After each field work is completed, a detailed inspection, acceptance, and registration are conducted when the locomotive enters the warehouse as a basis for the locomotive operator's five-day lineup. At the same time, machine operators are encouraged to develop the excellent work style of "careful maintenance and timely inspection" in their operations. Violations by machine operators are frequently criticized and educated, and exemplary machine operators are promptly praised and rewarded, which greatly encourages the enthusiasm of the machine operators. As a result, there has not been a single phenomenon in the city this year where production has been affected due to inadequate maintenance or inspection.

Thirdly, factory-commune ties have been established, creating a complete maintenance network. The city has a large-scale machinery repair factory, and all seventeen people's communes have established machinery repair stations. Each locomotive team has also established a machinery repair group. All thirteen factories and mines in the city and the people's communes are linked to provide repair assistance, ensuring that all kinds of agricultural machinery can be inspected, repaired, and operated normally in a timely manner.

    加强修配保养工作　培训大量技术人材
    侯马市充分发挥农业机具效能
    新华社太原22日电　山西省侯马市各级党委，在各行各业支援农业，大批农业机械运往农村以后，十分重视了充分发挥各种机械的效能和提高农业机械利用率的问题；认为作好这一工作，是加速农业技术改造，解决农村劳动力不足问题的关键之一。因此，市、社、管理区各级都有党委书记专管这一工作，并制定了农业机械管理档案和维修、操作及技术人员培养等各项制度，在全市范围内建立了一个完整的农业机械修配网，保证所有的农业机械都能用好、保养好，出了毛病能及时修理好。
    目前，全市十七个人民公社，一百七十多个管理区的一百六十四个标准台拖拉机，一千零四十七部排灌机械，十二部康拜因，绝大部分都已综合利用起来。据1至7月份的统计，拖拉机平均一个标准台完成九千三百九十五个耕熟亩，超过国家要求的21.2％。和去年同期相比，提高101.4％。耕地消耗费用，比去年零点七元，降低30％。排灌机械1至7月份浇地面积二十三万二千多亩，每马力平均二十五亩，比去年十点五亩，提高112.6％。同时，还出现了零三四八号拖拉机“千日安全无事故，万时生产不大修”，曲沃机电站热特二五K——五五号机车，每标准台完成二万四千九百九十个耕熟亩，泉常机电站每标准台完成二万二千八百三十个耕熟亩，宋郭机灌站创造了每马力平均浇地九十二亩的新纪录。
    侯马市的农业机械所以能够得到充分利用，首先是加强了政治思想教育，积极培养了技术人员。市委有耿步青书记专管这一工作，各社、区层层都有书记挂帅。全市每年初对全体机械手及干部进行一次评比、训练和整顿；各公社机电站每季进行一次对机械手的训练和检查；机车组十天一整顿，五天一排队，隔日一检查。市里经常举办训练班，并采用派机械手出外学习，师傅带徒弟等办法，培养技术人员。几年来，全市已培养出拥有一支三千三百五十二人的技术队伍。这些技术人员，不但都能掌握驾驶、保养和一般修理技术，而且坚持了政治挂帅，树立起爱护机器的思想，加强了工作责任心。
    其次是建立了经常的维修制度，制定了“机具使用管理制度，拖拉机保养手册”。各机电站所到机械，马上建立档案，制定“保养周期表”，以机器的年限长短和每个机器平时易发生故障的情况，规定使用时间的长短，保养的类别，进行检修的时间。对机械手实行了三种卡片：一种是“安全教育卡片”。为了堵塞人身事故和机具事故的发生，当发现有违犯驾驶规章制度的，立即进行教育，并在卡片上进行登记，作为年终评比升级的根据。一种是“出勤鉴定卡片”。机车出勤前，有保护不周，检查不到，温度不够，照明不亮，油料不足，油水不净的现象时，检查人员在卡片上登记，作为平时评比的条件，并及时采取措施进行改正，才准出勤。一种是“保养验收卡片”。每次田间工作完毕，在机车入库时，都得进行细致的检查验收和登记，作为机车手五日排队时的根据。同时，还提倡机械手在作业中发扬“保养细心，检查及时”的优良作风。并经常对机械手中的违章现象进行批评教育；对模范机械手进行及时的表扬和奖励，这样就大大鼓舞了各机械手的积极性。这样全市今年没有一个因维修不周，检查不到而影响生产的现象。
    第三是厂社挂钩，建立了完整的维修网，市里建有一个大型的机械修配厂，十七个人民公社都建立了机械修配站，各机车组又成立有机械修配组。全市十三个厂矿和各人民公社都对口挂钩，帮助修配。因而保证了各种农业机械能及时检修，正常运转。
