Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 23rd. Korean Premier Kim Il-sung delivered an important speech at the closing of the National Congress of Advanced Workers in the Chollima Work Team Movement on the 22nd, highly praising the Chollima Work Team Movement. Kim Il-sung pointed out that the Chollima Work Team Movement is a victory for the Korean Workers' Party's people-oriented style and mass line, and a brilliant and great communist school created by the Korean working class. He called on all the working people of Korea to participate in the Chollima Work Team Movement, to successfully complete the massive task of the Seven-Year Plan, and to further promote the Korean people's movement towards socialism and communism.

He pointed out that the Chollima Work Team Movement has rapidly expanded throughout the country since it was launched in March last year. To date, 8,600 work teams in northern Korea have participated in the movement, and 766 work teams have won the glorious title of Chollima Work Team.

Kim Il-sung said that the "Chollima" riders, by mechanizing and automating production processes and constantly adopting new production methods, have reduced labor intensity and rapidly increased production. He said that with the help of the collective, yesterday's backward elements have become today's active elements and have been transformed into new communists.

Kim Il-sung pointed out that all old ideas such as individualism, egoism, and liberalism are huge obstacles to socialist and communist construction. He said that the Chollima Work Team is a true communist collective where everyone works for everyone else and everyone works for the collective.

Kim Il-sung emphasized that revolution does not allow stagnation; it requires the continuous replacement of the old with the new in accordance with the laws of social development, and it requires continuous progress and innovation. He called on the advanced workers of the Chollima Work Team Movement and all working people to whip the horses and continue to move forward and innovate with greater vigor, dedicating all their energy and enthusiasm to the successful completion of the Seven-Year Plan and the realization of the noble task of technical innovation.

    金日成在千里马作业班运动先进工作者大会上发言
    号召朝鲜人民胜利完成七年计划
    大会在听取二十五位代表介绍先进经验后闭幕
    新华社平壤23日电　朝鲜内阁首相金日成在22日闭幕的朝鲜全国千里马作业班运动先进工作者大会上作了重要的发言，对千里马作业班运动给予高度评价。金日成指出，千里马作业班运动是朝鲜劳动党的人民作风和群众路线的胜利，是朝鲜工人阶级创造的辉煌而伟大的共产主义学校。他号召朝鲜全体劳动人民参加千里马作业班运动，以胜利完成七年计划的巨大任务，来进一步促进朝鲜人民走向社会主义和共产主义前进的运动。
    他指出，千里马作业班运动自从去年3月发起以来，已经迅速地扩大到全国。到今天为止，朝鲜北部各地已经有八千六百个作业班参加了这个运动，并且已经有七百六十六个作业班获得了千里马作业班的光荣称号。
    金日成说，“千里马”的骑手们由于把生产工序机械化和自动化，不断采取新的生产方法，使劳动强度减轻，使生产迅速增长。他说：在集体的帮助下，昨天的落后分子成了今天的积极分子，被改造成为共产主义的新人。
    金日成指出：个人主义、利己主义、自由主义等一切旧的思想是社会主义和共产主义建设的巨大的障碍。他说：千里马作业班是我为人人、人人为我的真正的共产主义的集体。
    金日成强调说，革命不容许停滞不前，它要求根据社会发展规律，不断地以新的代替旧的，要求继续地前进和革新。他号召千里马作业班运动的先进工作者和全体劳动人民快马加鞭，以更大的干劲，继续前进，继续革新，为了胜利完成七年计划，为了实现技术革新的崇高任务献出一切的精力和干劲。
    朝鲜千里马作业班运动先进工作者大会一共开了四天。在这次大会期间，共有二十五个先进工作者在会上发了言，介绍了他们的先进经验。大会通过了给朝鲜全体劳动人民的号召书，号召全体劳动人民参加千里马作业班运动。大会还通过了给朝鲜劳动党中央的信。
    大会闭幕后举行了授勋仪式。朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔镛健授予工业战线上的千里马作业班班长吉确实、李承焕、朱成一、陈应源以劳动英雄的称号，并授予十四名先进工作者以劳动勋章。朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹发给了获得千里马作业班称号的每个先进集体以奖状和奖品。
