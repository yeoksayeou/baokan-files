    Experiences in整理扬州评话《武松》
    Wang Shaotang

    I am a Yangzhou storytelling artist. I tell stories from "Water Margin," with the titles "Wu Song," "Song Jiang," "Shi Xiu," and "Lu Junyi," each in ten episodes. These stories have been passed down from my ancestors, and I have been telling them for over sixty years. In the past, telling stories was just to make a living, but after liberation, my understanding has improved, and my work has new content and meaning. This increased awareness has made me realize that traditional stories must be整理before they can serve socialism by "making the past serve the present." I owe this understanding to the leadership and education of the Party, which has enabled someone like me, in their seventies, to understand so much. Last year, with the help of the Party and the government, my "Wu Song" was整理and published. This was my long-cherished wish, and it was realized in just a few months. I am truly happy.

    Speaking of the "Water Margin" storytelling, its source is partly from the original "Water Margin" book, but most of it—and the most distinctive part of this storytelling—is the continuous creation of generations of storytelling artists, passed down and enriched generation after generation. The original description of Wu Song, which was over 80,000 words, has been expanded to over one million words. I don't know how much effort so many people have put into it. It is the result of continuous processing and enrichment by generations of artists. This heritage belongs to the motherland and the people. Today, with the attention and care of the Party and the government, it has been recorded,整理, and published through me. Such a valuable heritage of folk oral literature has been fully preserved and handed over to the Party and the people. For me, it is another thing I have done for socialism, so how can I not be happy! Speaking of整理ing "Wu Song," to be honest, I can't say I have any experience to share, but I do have deep feelings. Since liberation, the Party has always been very concerned about our storytelling art. The Chinese 曲艺 Workers Association has also been very concerned about the整理work of these ten episodes of "Water Margin," and the Jiangsu Provincial Culture Bureau has directly led this work. As early as 1953, recording began. They specially asked me to go to Nanjing, to a large teahouse facing the Qinhuai River in Confucius Temple, and set up a storytelling venue for me, so that I could tell stories and have them recorded. The Nanjing Municipal Culture Bureau and Federation of Literary and Art Circles spent seventeen months, using both pens and tape recorders, to record all the storytelling except for the last few sections of "Shi Xiu's Ten Episodes." Later, the recorded manuscripts were all transferred to Yangzhou. Under the leadership of the Yangzhou Municipal Party Committee, the Yangzhou Municipal Culture Office and I checked the previously recorded storytelling word by word, and also recorded my learning experience and performance experience. Therefore, before the formal整理of "Wu Song," the Party and the government had already done a lot of work.

    The formal整理work began in the spring of 1959. In order to整理it in a few months and dedicate it to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic, the Municipal Party Committee first strengthened its leadership over this work. The Municipal Party Secretary took charge personally, and the Minister of Propaganda participated personally. They also sent two comrades with considerable cultivation in language and literature to work and study with the responsible comrades of the Culture Office and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and formed a整理work group. In this way, with the leadership of the Party, the整理work of this "Wu Song," which is as long as a million words, was completed in just a few months. This is a miracle, and also a product inspired by the great leap forward. I feel from the bottom of my heart that the leadership of the Party is correct, and the great leap forward is good. Without these two, the book would not have come out. If you want to talk about experience, this is the most important experience.

    This整理work, for me, is a study and an improvement in ideological understanding. Originally, I took this work very simply, and I was somewhat superstitious about myself. I didn't say it out loud, but I thought in my heart: I have told this story for more than sixty years, and I started learning it at the age of seven. The first episode was "Wu Song Beats the Tiger." The audience is always satisfied when I tell it now, so there shouldn't be much of a problem. Besides, some comrades also think that my story just needs to be recorded, and the sentences and punctuation need to be changed. I became even more confident in myself. At this time, the leader of our整理group—the Municipal Party Secretary—held a meeting in time and pointed out that both conservative and crude tendencies were wrong. At this time, I understood a little bit. My original ideas were not right. I didn't have much crude thinking, but I still had a lot of conservative thinking. Therefore, I was educated as soon as the整理work started. Not only that, the leadership further told us: The整理of "Wu Song" is by no means for the sake of整理, but to promote the excellent traditions of the national heritage under the guidance of the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and bringing forth the new from the old, according to the spirit of taking its essence and discarding its dross, so as to achieve the purpose of making the past serve the present. In this way, my mind was clear, my purpose was clear, my requirements were specific, and there was a ruler to guide the整理, and I grasped the measure. But this does not mean that all problems have been solved. In the specific整理process, there are still many problems. These books have been circulating among the people for decades or hundreds of years and are welcomed by the majority of citizens, which is in the spirit of the people. However, since it was left over from that dirty society, there will of course be some spots and vulgar dross. The essence and dross are mixed together, and sometimes it is not easy to distinguish. Also, the use of dialects and the treatment of "extra-text" caused controversy. But with the instructions of the Party, it is easier to reach a consensus when discussing and studying, because there is a direction. I really feel that these instructions of the Party are both a "touchstone" and a "dividing bead." As long as we follow the instructions of the Party, there is no mistake. Because we listened to the Party, our整理process was much smoother.

    The next question is how we started. To catch up with the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic, there were only a few months left. This book is over a million words long. It won’t work without a good method. According to this situation, the group decided to first engage in "experimental fields," selecting the first three episodes with the most problems and the most complexity in "Wu’s Ten Episodes": "Beating the Tiger on Jingyang Ridge," "Wu Song Killing His Sister-in-Law," and "Fighting and Killing Ximen Qing" for prior整理.

    In order to do this work well, the method we found was "three more": more meetings, more research, and more consultation. Before整理, we carefully checked the original manuscript, then divided it into paragraphs, added punctuation, and corrected wrong sentences. After collective research, everyone's opinions were consistent before we began to整理. In order to make this整理version reach a higher level, in addition to carefully studying the original "Water Margin," we also read some paragraphs that have been published in several publications such as "People's Literature," "曲艺," and "萌芽," and absorbed the整理experience of Hangzhou storytelling "Wu Song Romance," so that our整理work had a reference and comparison.

    In the整理, we encountered some problems. In the "Blood Splattered Mandarin Duck Tower" section of the book, Wu Song killed a lot of people. Some people say he killed too many. Should we let him kill more or kill less? The debate was at an impasse. At this time, the leadership told us: The problem is not the number of people killed. We have to see what kind of people Wu Song killed. At this point, my mind brightened. That's right! Wu Song killed landlords, bullies, local tyrants, and evil gentry, these bad guys. This not only did not harm the heroic character of Wu Song, but also helped him: Wu Song's killing reflected the deep hatred of the peasant masses for the feudal landlord class, so we had a basis for整理ing it. At the same time, I also understood that there must be a class analysis and a class viewpoint when looking at problems. Chairman Mao said these things long ago. They are really correct. It is bright and clear to look at problems according to Chairman Mao's words. Therefore, it is easier to solve such problems in subsequent research discussions. For example, in the past, I described the image of "Mother Night叉" Sun Erniang like this: "She is exceptionally tall, nearly ten feet tall. Her face is no different from sand and soil. The brow bone protrudes a long way. She has two sparse eyebrows, with a few red hairs at the ends of her eyebrows. She has a pair of ?瘘eyes, with eyeballs sunken inside, with red veins on the whites of her eyes, and red veins on the blacks of her eyes, glowing brightly. She has a hooked nose, a sunken mouth, a protruding lower jaw, and a mouthful of black and焦牙." Why did I say that in the past? Since she is a "Mother Night叉," she must be described like a "Mother Night叉." How did I know that in this way, I was uglying the heroic character. Now I understand that the description of characters should have a class viewpoint, and that we should have clear love and hatred. Therefore, we quickly reached a consensus during the discussion.

    For example, regarding the handling of "extra-text" outside the main text. Some of these "extra-text" are plots that were arranged in the book by previous artists, and some are interludes that we temporarily grabbed on the storytelling stage. These sections, when told on the stage, can often win a roar of laughter from the audience, and the effect is not bad, but some are "extra-text" for the sake of "科," which have little to do with the plot and are a bit cumbersome. Based on this situation, on the one hand, we adopted the method of compressing and refining the "extra-text" that is related to the plot and retained it; on the other hand, we removed the "extra-text" that is not related to the plot. To be honest, these small paragraphs have been said in my mouth for decades, and I am a little reluctant to remove them all at once! However, after such correct handling, not only did it not affect the development of the entire plot, but it also made the entire plot closer, and my ideological problem was solved. It is strange to say that conservative thinking cannot be eliminated all at once. I feel that my conservative thinking needs to be constantly cleared. Chairman Mao said that we must continue to make revolution, and my thinking must also continue to make revolution. Therefore, the整理process of this book is also my learning process, the process of continuous revolution in my thinking, and also the process of improving my ideological understanding.

    In the process of discussing these specific issues, the prominent and complex issue was the debate on the use of dialects. "Yangzhou storytelling" of course uses the Yangzhou dialect, but dialects have limitations. Therefore, some incomprehensible dialects are replaced with Mandarin. There are also such situations where it is difficult to express the original meaning without using dialects, so the original words are still retained, and annotations are added next to them. According to this principle, many problems were solved smoothly. Of course, it sounds smooth now, but it was indeed a bit of a twist when整理ing and discussing it. It was the timely instructions of the leadership that solved many problems one by one. Therefore, I say that everything must rely on the Party, and only by relying on the Party can there be a way to solve the problem. The success of the "experimental field" is entirely due to the good leadership of the Party.

    After the整理version of the first three episodes came out, we printed out the first draft and sent it to the Chinese 曲协 and the Jiangsu Provincial Culture Bureau and other relevant parties. At the same time, we also held a audience symposium to solicit opinions from all parties. Our city and province both attached great importance to and supported this. The responsible comrades of the Chinese 曲协 personally reviewed the first draft, and also held an expert symposium for us, and put forward specific guiding opinions and suggestions on the shaping of characters, the handling of plots, and the use of language in the book, which greatly helped our further整理.

    Because the method of engaging in "experimental fields" in the first three episodes was correct, and we gained some experience and made a model, the整理of the last seven episodes was much smoother. The first three episodes took four months of work, and the last seven episodes took only two months of work. In total, it took six months to complete the整理work of the full-length "Wu Song" of a million words. Everyone said this was more, faster, better, and more economical. I thought to myself: How can it be more, faster, better, and more economical? This is the result of listening to the Party, implementing the three-combination working method instructed by the Party, and implementing the Party's literary and artistic policy. This "Wu Song" is a product of the great leap forward, and a product of exerting great effort and striving for the top.

    The book "Wu Song" has been published, and I am currently starting to整理the remaining three ten episodes. Now I have set out a plan to study Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought. With this weapon, coupled with the experience of整理ing "Wu Song Ten Episodes," I have the confidence to整理it well. I will strive to first整理"Song Jiang Ten Episodes" to welcome the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the Party.

    Now, we are in an era of the great leap forward where "one day equals twenty years." Thinking about this, my enthusiasm is even greater. I am in my seventies and have experienced so much change. I have never seen such an era. I have spoken of countless heroes, but there are nowhere near as many heroes as there are today! I am truly overjoyed. Seeing the prospects of socialism and communism, I am old but my ambition is still there, and I am getting younger and younger. People say that "it is rare for a person to live to be seventy since ancient times," but I say that I must work hard with everyone to the end. I will use our 曲艺 form to reflect the new people and new things of building socialism and communism, and send 曲艺 to communes, factories, and mines. I will also impart my shallow art to the younger generation without reservation, and contribute to socialism and communism, so that our 曲艺 flower will bloom better and more beautifully, and build our socialism and communism faster and better.

    整理扬州评话《武松》的体会
    王少堂
    我是扬州市的一个评话艺人。说的是《水浒》，书目有《武松》、《宋江》、《石秀》、《卢俊义》四个十回。这些书，从我的祖上传到我的手里，也已经说了六十多年了。过去说书是为了混生活，过日子，只有到了解放后，才使我的认识提高了，工作有了新的内容和意义。认识的提高，使我在思想上明确了传统书目必须经过整理，才能达到“古为今用”地为社会主义服务的目的。这些，多亏党的领导和党的教育，才使得我这个七十几岁的人晓得了这么多的道理。去年党和政府又帮助我把《武松》整理出版了，这是我多年的愿望，在短短的几个月中就实现了，我真是高兴。
    谈到《水浒》这部评话，它的来源一部分是取自《水浒传》原书，而大部分——也是这部评话中最有特色的部分——则是历代评话艺人的不断创造，一代一代地传下来，一代一代地丰富它，由原书中关于武松的描写的八万多字扩大到一百多万字，这里边不知有多少人花了多少心血，它是历代艺人不断加工丰富的结果。这笔遗产是祖国的、人民的，今天经过党和政府的重视和关怀，从我这里把它记录下来，整理出版了，把这样一个民间口头文学的宝贵遗产全部保留下来，交给了党和人民，在我来说，又为社会主义做了一件事，我心里怎么能不高兴呢！谈到整理《武松》这部书来，说实在话，我还说不出什么经验来，不过给我的感受倒是很深的。解放后，党对我们评话艺术一直就非常关怀，中国曲艺工作者协会对《水浒》这几个十回书的整理工作也很关心，江苏省文化局直接领导了这个工作。早在1953年就开始记录，特地要我到南京去，在夫子庙面临秦淮河的一个大茶馆里，为我辟出了一个书场，一面说书一面记录。南京市文化局、文联花了十七个月的时间，又用笔，又用录音机，记下了除《石秀十回》最后几段之外的全部书词。以后又将记录稿全部移交给扬州市，在扬州市委的领导下，扬州市文化处和我逐字逐句地核对了以前记录下来的书词，又把我的学艺经过和表演经验记了下来。所以，在正式整理《武松》之前，党和政府已经做了不少工作。
    正式的整理工作是在1959年春天开始的。为了要在几个月的时间里整理出来，向建国十周年献礼，市委首先加强了对这项工作的领导，市委书记亲自挂帅，宣传部长亲自参加，还派了两位在语言和文学上有相当修养的同志专门与文化处、文联负责同志和我一道工作，一道研究，并且组成了整理工作小组。这样，有了党的领导，这部长达百万字的《武松》的整理工作，在短短的几个月中就完成了。这是一个奇迹，也是大跃进形势鼓舞下的产物。我从心里感到党的领导就是对，大跃进就是好，没有这两条，书就出不来。要说经验，这就是最重要的经验了。
    这次整理工作，对我来说，是一次学习，是一次思想认识上的提高。本来，我把这项工作看得很简单，有些迷信自己，嘴里不说心里说：这部书在我手里说了六十多年，七岁学书，第一回就是《武松打虎》，说到现在，听众总是满意的，不见得有多大问题。再说，有些同志也认为我的书只要记下来，把句子、标点改改也就行了。我就更加相信自己了。这个时候，我们整理小组的组长——市委书记及时地召开了会议，指出了保守和粗暴两种倾向都是错误的。这时候，我心里有点数了，我原来的想法不对头，粗暴思想我不多，保守思想就还不少，所以，整理工作刚刚动手，我就受到教育。不仅如此，领导上还进一步告诉我们：整理《武松》决不是为整理而整理，而是要在党的百花齐放、推陈出新方针指导下，根据取其精华，去其糟粕的精神，发扬民族遗产的优良传统，以达到古为今用的目的。这样一来，我的脑筋清爽了，目的明确，要求具体，整理起来就有了一根尺，掌握了分寸。但这不等于一切问题都解决了，在具体的整理过程中，碰到的问题还是不少的。这些书，几十年、上百年地在民间流传，受到广大市民的欢迎，是有人民性的；但是它从那个肮脏社会里遗留下来，当然会有些斑斑点点和低级庸俗的糟粕，精华和糟粕混杂在一起，有时候不容易分清；还有对方言土语的运用以及对“书外书”的处理，也引起了争论。但是有了党的指示，讨论研究起来，就有了方向，不同的看法也就容易取得一致了。我真感到党的这些指示，既是“试金石”又是“分水珠”，只要按照党的指示去做，就没有错；正因为听了党的话，我们的整理过程就顺利得多了。
    下面的问题就是我们怎样动手了。要赶上向建国十周年献礼，时间只有几个月，这部书又是洋洋百万多字，没有好的方法是不行的。根据这个情况，小组研究决定先搞“试验田”，选出《武十回》中问题最多也最复杂的前三回：《景阳岗打虎》、《武松杀嫂》、《斗杀西门庆》先行整理。
    为了把这个工作做得好，找到的办法就是“三多”：多开会、多研究、多协商。整理之前，认真地核对了原稿，然后再分段落，加标点，改病句。通过集体研究，大家意见一致了，才开始动笔整理。为了使这个整理本达到较高的水平，除认真研究了《水浒》原著外，我们又阅读了《人民文学》、《曲艺》、《萌芽》等几个刊物上已经发表的一些段子，并且吸取了杭州评话《武松演义》的整理经验，这样就使得我们的整理工作有了借鉴和比较。
    在整理当中，我们碰到一些问题。在《血溅鸳鸯楼》这段书里，武松杀的人确实不少。有人说杀的太多了。究竟让他多杀些，还是少杀些呢？争论不下。这时候领导上告诉我们：问题不是杀得多和少的问题。要看看武松杀的是什么人。这一来，我的心里明亮了。是么！武松杀的是地主、恶霸、土豪、劣绅这些坏蛋，对武松这个英雄人物不但没有损害，而且还有帮助：武松的杀人，反映农民群众对封建地主阶级的深仇大恨，所以我们整理起来就有了依据。同时，我也懂得了看问题总得有个阶级分析，有个阶级观点。这些话，毛主席早就说过了，真是正确，按照毛主席的话去看问题，就是明亮，就是清爽。所以以后碰到这类问题的研究讨论，就容易解决。又如，我过去对“母夜叉”孙二娘的形象是这样说的：“她的个子大得出色，身高将近一丈，她这副脸和沙土无二样，门楼头凸起多远的。两条稀稀的眉毛，眉毛梢子上有几根红的。一双?瘘眼，眼睛珠子凹在里面，白眼珠子上生红丝，黑眼珠子上也有红丝，炯炯有光。鹰钩鼻子，瘪嘴，翘下额，一嘴黑焦牙。”我过去为什么这样说呢？“母夜叉”么，就要说得像个“母夜叉”。哪里知道这样一来，就丑化了英雄人物。现在懂得了，描写人物应当有个阶级观点，要爱憎分明，所以在讨论的时候，很快就取得了一致的意见。
    再如，对正文以外的“书外书”的处理问题。这些“书外书”，有些是前辈艺人早就安排在书里的情节，有些是我们在书台子上临时急抓的插叙。这些段子在书台子上说起来，往往能够博得听众的哄堂大笑，效果还不错，但也有些是为“科”而“科”的“书外书”，与情节关系不大，放在上面有些累赘。根据这个情况，一方面对其中与情节有关联的“书外书”，采取了压缩提炼的办法保留下来；另一方面对与情节无关的“书外书”进行了割除。说真的，这些小段子在嘴里说了几十年，一下子去掉了，心里还有些舍不得呢！可是经过这样的正确处理以后，不但没有影响整个情节的发展，而且使整个情节更加紧密，我的思想问题也就解决了。说来奇怪，保守思想不是一下子就能除得掉的，我觉得自己的保守思想就需要不断地清除，毛主席说要不断革命，我这个思想也要不断革命。所以这部书的整理过程，也就是我学习的过程，思想上不断革命的过程，也是我提高思想认识的过程。
    在这些具体问题的讨论过程中，突出的复杂的问题，要算是对使用方言土语的争论了。“扬州评话”当然是要用扬州的方言，但是方言有局限性，因此对一些令人费解的土语就用普通话代替。另外也有这样的情况，不用方言就难以表达原来的意思，就仍然保留原话，而在旁边加上注解。按照这个原则，许多问题也就顺利解决了。当然，现在说起来很顺当，但是在整理讨论的时候，确实费了些周折，都是领导上及时指示，许多问题才逐个解决的。所以我说，任何事情都要依靠党，也只有依靠党才有办法，才能解决问题。“试验田”搞得成功，完全是党的领导好。
    前三回的整理本搞出来以后，我们把初稿打印出来，给中国曲协和江苏省文化局以及其他有关方面寄去了，同时还召开了听众座谈会，征求了各方面的意见。我们市里和省里都非常重视和支持。中国曲协的负责同志，亲自审阅了初稿，还为我们召开了专家座谈会，对书中人物形象的塑造，情节的处理，语言的运用等等方面，都提出了具体的指导性的意见和建议，对我们的进一步整理有很大的帮助。
    由于前三回搞“试验田”的方法做得对头，有了些经验，做出了样子，所以整理后七回就顺当得多。前三回花了四个月的工夫，后七回只用了两个月工夫。前后共计六个月，就完成了一部百万字的长篇《武松》的整理工作，大家都说这是多快好省。我心里想啊：怎么能够多快好省的呢？这就是听了党的话，执行了党所指示的三结合的工作方法，贯彻了党的文艺方针的结果。这部《武松》是大跃进的产物，是鼓足干劲，力争上游的产物。
    《武松》这部书出版了，目前我正在着手整理其余三个十回。现在我订出了计划，要学习毛主席的文艺思想，有了这个武器，再加上整理《武松十回》的经验，我就有了信心，一定要把它整理好。争取首先把《宋江十回》整理出来，迎接党的四十周年。
    现在，我们正处在“一天等于二十年”的大跃进的时代里，想想这些，我的劲头就大了。我是七十几岁的人了，经历了多少沧海桑田，从来也没见过这样的时代。在我嘴里说过的英雄无其数，哪里有今天的英雄这样多！我真是心花怒放。看到社会主义、共产主义的前景，我是人老雄心在，愈过愈年轻。人家说“人生七十古来稀”，我说一定要和大家轰轰烈烈干到底。用我们这个曲艺形式来反映建设社会主义、共产主义的新人新事，把曲艺送到公社、工厂和矿山。我还要把自己这点浅薄的艺术，毫不保留地传授给青年一代，为社会主义、共产主义出力出汗，让我们曲艺这朵花，开得更好更美丽，把我们的社会主义、共产主义建设得更快更好。
