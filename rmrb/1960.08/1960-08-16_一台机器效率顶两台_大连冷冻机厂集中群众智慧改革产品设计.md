According to a report in the Lüda Daily News: The Dalian Refrigeration Machinery Plant mobilized the masses to adopt methods such as on-site dissection and mass diagnosis to carry out forty-six major revolutions on more than twenty kinds of products, transforming the products completely. Among them, the weight of two types of refrigerators did not increase, but the efficiency doubled, one machine being equivalent to two, and taking a big step towards advanced technology.

In the past, although the factory's employees continuously carried out product design revolutions, they could only reform general parts and did not dare to touch products with more complex technology. With the deepening of the campaign to seize materials, the factory's employees emboldened themselves and launched an earth-shaking product design revolution to climb the peaks of technology. They aimed the spearhead of the revolution at three large key products: refrigerators and evaporators. These products had been modified four or five times in the past, but the broad masses of employees were not satisfied and actively responded to the Party's call, immediately taking action and using the spirit of continuous revolution to develop product revolution in a new technical direction, so that products could achieve high standards, large scale, precision, and cutting-edge technology. In just two days, they put forward more than 100 modification plans, and repeatedly discussed them by taking the method of proposing plans and simultaneously airing views. One plan was overturned, and another advanced plan appeared, overturning and appearing one after another. The new plan finally determined by everyone was to increase the speed of two types of refrigerators from 480 rpm to 960 rpm, and the cooling capacity was to be doubled. However, some people believed that this idea was impossible to realize, because they had never seen refrigerators reaching such high speeds from foreign products and materials, with the highest reaching only 720 rpm. They criticized this kind of thinking, and under the leadership of the Party committee, technicians, workers, and cadres dissected and diagnosed the refrigerators together, modified the cooler, and closely matched the gap between the cylinder and the piston to further enhance the precision of the machine parts and the compression capacity. After conducting bold experiments, the result was that the machine's rotation speed was very normal, and the expected effect was achieved. Those with superstitious ideas received a profound education in the face of the facts. Then, the broad masses of employees creatively reformed the structure of the evaporator. This structure is still a new creation in the refrigeration industry, not only saving 10% of the materials, but also saving 30% of the man-hours. (Attached picture)

    一台机器效率顶两台
    大连冷冻机厂集中群众智慧改革产品设计
    据旅大日报消息　大连冷冻机厂发动群众采取现场大解剖、大会诊的方法，将二十多种产品进行了四十六项大革命，使产品脱胎换骨。其中有两种型号冷冻机体重没增加，效率却提高了一倍，一台顶两台，并向先进技术迈进了一大步。
    过去，这个厂职工虽然不断进行产品设计革命，但也只能改革一般性的部件，对那些技术比较复杂的产品不敢动。随着夺材大战的深入开展，这个厂职工壮大了胆子，掀起了一个翻天复地的产品设计大革命，攀登技术高峰。他们把革命的矛头对准了冷冻机和蒸发器三种大型关键产品。这些产品过去都进行过四五次修改，但广大职工，并没因此而满足，积极响应党的号召，立即行动起来，以不断革命精神使产品革命向新的技术方向发展，使产品达到高、大、精、尖。他们仅在两天内就提出了修改方案一百多项，并采取边提方案边鸣放的方法进行了反复讨论。一个方案被推翻了，另一个先进方案又出现，接二连三不断推翻不断出现。大家最后确定下来的新方案，要把两种类型冷冻机转数由每分钟四百八十转提高到九百六十转，制冷量要增加一倍。但是，有人认为这种设想是不可能实现的，因为从外国的产品和资料上从未见过冷冻机能达到这样高的速度，最高才达到每分钟七百二十转。他们批判了这种思想，在党委领导下技术人员、工人、干部一起对冷冻机进行了大解剖，大会诊，修改了冷却器，使汽缸和活塞间隙进行了紧密的配合，来进一步增强机器部件的精密度和压缩的能力。他们进行了大胆的试验以后，结果机器旋转的速度很正常，收到了人们预计的效果。有迷信思想的人，在事实面前受到了深刻的教育。接着广大职工又创造性地改革了蒸发器的结构。这种结构在冷冻机行业里还是一个新的创造，不但节约了10％的材料，而且还节省了30％的工时。（附图片）
