    Doing Good Deeds for the Commune
    We fifteen are veteran workers from the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant, representing various trades: machining, fitter, ironworking, carpentry, casting, electrical, and welding. This March, we jointly initiated a competition proposal to the workers of Shanxi Province, calling for doing a few good deeds to support agriculture. This received an enthusiastic response from workers across the province, and the Shanxi Daily even published a special editorial. This greatly encouraged us. In the first half of this year, we did a lot for the communes. In addition to giving 125 technical books to the farmers, we installed 265 sets of locomobiles, diesel engines, etc., held 150 technical lectures, and trained more than 30 rural technicians.
    We initiated this effort to do good deeds to support agriculture mainly after hearing the Party Central Committee's policy that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. We felt that the past piecemeal methods of supporting agriculture were no longer sufficient and that various trades needed to cooperate and coordinate to support agriculture. Therefore, we, veteran workers from different trades, organized ourselves into a core group to support agriculture. Each of us was assigned to be responsible for a management area, visiting the management areas every fifth and tenth day of the month to connect with the commune members. When encountering urgent tasks to support agriculture, we would complete them in our spare time that same day. For example, Comrade Jing Fengyu once traveled to all the management areas of the Guzhang and Huangnian communes, inspecting and recording the usage of all irrigation and drainage equipment. Upon returning to the factory, he immediately mobilized everyone to make 53 rush parts, repairing all the irrigation and drainage equipment within three to five days, supporting the fight against drought. When we go to the countryside, we bring tools, dry rations, materials, and spare parts. We don't eat the commune's food, disrupt rural work, make conditions, or ask for remuneration. We respect rural customs and often exchange work experience in industrial and agricultural production with our farmer brothers. Recently, we used 15 days of our spare time to rush-produce seven 800-meter elbow pipe sections and eight steel sleeves for the large pumping station of the Huangnian Commune, saving 3,000 mu of land from the threat of drought. The farmers excitedly said to us, "The leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is truly good, the workers and peasants are as close as one family!"

### 为公社做好事

    为公社做好事
    我们十五人是长治钢铁厂的老工人，机、钳、铁、木、铸、电、焊，各工种都有。今年3月份，我们曾联名向山西省职工发出为支援农业办几件好事的竞赛创议，得到了全省职工热烈响应，山西日报还专门发表了社论。这使我们受到了很大的鼓舞。今年上半年，我们给公社做了不少事。除了送给农民一百二十五册技术书籍以外，还安装锅驼机、柴油机等二百六十五台次，举办技术讲座一百五十次，培养了农村技术工人三十余名。
    我们发起为支援农业做好事，主要是听到党中央提出农业是国民经济的基础这一方针后，感到过去零敲碎打地支援农业的方法已经不够了，需要各工种协作配合起来支援农业。于是，我们不同工种的老工人就组织起来成立了一个支援农业的核心小组，各人分工负责一个管理区，逢五排十到管理区登门拜访，和社员们联系，遇到有支援农业的紧急任务，就在当天业余时间去完成。像荆逢玉同志曾经跑遍了故漳和黄碾公社的管理区，检查和记录了所有排灌设备的使用情况。回厂后，立即发动大家突击制造五十三项零件，在三、五天内把排灌设备都修理好，支援了抗旱斗争。我们下乡带工具、带干粮、带资料、带备件；不吃公社的饭，不打乱农村工作，不讲条件，不计报酬，尊重农村的风俗习惯，并且经常和农民兄弟交流工农业生产上的工作经验。最近我们又利用十五天的业余时间给黄碾公社的大型抽水机台赶制了八百米的弯头管节七个，钢套八个，使三千亩土地摆脱了旱象的威胁。农民们激动地对我们说：“共产党、毛主席的领导真是好，工农亲如一家！”
