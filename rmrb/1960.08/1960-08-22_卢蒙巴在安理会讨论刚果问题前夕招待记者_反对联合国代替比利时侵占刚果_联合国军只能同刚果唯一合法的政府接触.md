Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch from Leopoldville: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba emphasized at a press conference on the 20th that "We do not want a UN occupation to replace the Belgian occupation. The UN's mission here is limited."

He condemned the UN for "not only tacitly recognizing the secession of Katanga Province in the Congo, but also openly violating the Security Council's decision." He also accused Hammarskjöld of refusing to allow the Congolese government the use of aircraft to transport Congolese troops to Katanga Province.

The press conference was held on the eve of the UN Security Council meeting to discuss the Congo issue. At the press conference, Lumumba pointed out that the Congo would submit eight demands to the Security Council, including: transporting Congolese troops to any region of the Congo where they need to be stationed, allowing the Congolese National Army to control all Congolese airports and ports, withdrawing all "UN" white troops from the Congo, the immediate withdrawal of all Belgian troops from the Congo, including the Kitona and Kamina bases, and that the "UN forces" in the Congo only contact the Congo's sole legitimate government. He also demanded that the Congolese government be given regular reports on the activities of the "UN forces" in the Congo.

The Congolese Prime Minister said that the Congolese government had authorized him to seek military or other assistance outside the UN if his demands were not met at the UN Security Council meeting.

Lumumba also said that although he had lost confidence in UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, he trusted the UN.

At the press conference, Lumumba also condemned Belgium for using Sabena Airlines planes to airlift spies from Brazzaville to the Congo. At the same time, he accused France of violating Congolese airspace and sovereignty by transporting spies to Luluabourg in Kasai Province in an aircraft. He also said that Belgium and France were smuggling weapons into Kasai Province in an attempt to create division.

Lumumba said that fifteen Belgian paratroopers had been arrested while plotting to infiltrate the Congolese port of Matadi by boat and were now being brought to Leopoldville for trial. Sources indicate that the "UN forces" blatantly disregarded the authority of the Congolese government in the Congolese capital of Leopoldville on the 20th by sheltering a Belgian colonial criminal.

The criminal was Diou, the deputy manager of Belgian Sabena Airlines. On the morning of the 20th, after being tried in a Congolese court, he should have been returned to prison, but he fled to the French embassy there to hide. When the Congolese authorities dispatched military police, police, and troops to the French embassy to demand the surrender of the criminal, "UN forces" equipped with submachine guns immediately rushed to the embassy to protect the criminal.

It is reported that Diou's crimes were engaging in conspiratorial activities against the Congolese government and deliberately ordering an aircraft of his airline, originally scheduled to fly to Luluabourg in Kasai Province, to fly to Elisabethville in Katanga Province, allowing the Katanga Province secessionist "government" authorities to arrest two members of the Congolese National Movement Party on board the aircraft.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch from Leopoldville: Disregarding the Congolese government's legitimate demand for the return of airport control, the "UN forces" continue to occupy the N'djili Airport in the Congolese capital and on the 19th increased the number of "UN troops" stationed there sixfold.

According to a report by the German News Agency, relations between the "UN representative" in the Congo and the Congolese government have "cooled to near zero."

The "UN forces" have built trenches, erected barbed wire fences, and established positions around the airport. According to Agence France-Presse, these UN forces were "at war" all day on the 19th. They set up checkpoints on the 25-kilometer-long road from N'djili Airport to Leopoldville. These "UN" soldiers, armed with bayoneted rifles, blocked Congolese soldiers from going to the airport to perform their duties and strictly "inspected" Congolese people entering the airport.

The "UN forces" strengthened their war preparations at N'djili Airport after Congolese soldiers at the airport fought back against a group of arrogant Canadian officers and soldiers of the "UN forces" on the morning of the 18th. That evening, UN Under-Secretary-General Bunche, an American, issued a slanderous statement on the incident, threatening that any further acts of "harassment" against his personnel would be "intolerable." The American also demanded that Congolese radio broadcast his statement. However, Congolese radio refused his request on the orders of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba.

According to a dispatch from Elisabethville, "UN forces" under US control are steadily entering the resource-rich Katanga Province of the Congo. On the 19th, three giant US "Globemaster" transport planes airlifted another contingent of nearly two hundred "UN troops" to Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province. It is estimated that the UN's strength in the province has increased to four thousand men.

News also said that the blue-helmeted "UN forces" patrolled in Elisabethville on the 19th together with the police of the Tshombe "government." At the same time, another "UN force" is conducting "takeovers" in some strongholds in northern Katanga Province – areas where the struggle against colonialism and against the Tshombe secessionist plot is surging.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch from New York: Bunche, the US UN Under-Secretary-General hated by the Congolese people, can no longer stay in the Congo to engage in conspiratorial activities against the Congolese people. UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld had no choice but to announce yesterday that the American, who implemented a colonialist policy in the Congo, would be transferred back to UN headquarters in New York.

Hammarskjöld announced that he had appointed an Indian official to replace the American. The Indian official is Rajeshwar Dayal, the current Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan. Dayal served as a member of the UN's three-member observer group in Lebanon in 1958.

    卢蒙巴在安理会讨论刚果问题前夕招待记者
    反对联合国代替比利时侵占刚果
    联合国军只能同刚果唯一合法的政府接触
    新华社21日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴20日在一次记者招待会上强调说，“我们不愿用联合国占领代替比利时占领。联合国在这里的任务是有限度的。”
    他谴责联合国“不仅是暗中承认刚果加丹加省的分裂，而且公开违反安全理事会的决定”。他还指责哈马舍尔德拒绝把飞机交给刚果政府使用，以便把刚果军队运往加丹加省。
    这次记者招待会是在联合国安全理事会将开会讨论刚果问题的前夕举行的。卢蒙巴在这次记者招待会上指出刚果将向安全理事会提出八点要求，其中包括：把刚果军队运到需要驻扎的刚果任何一个地区，允许刚果国家军队控制刚果一切机场和港口，从刚果撤出一切“联合国”白人军队，一切比利时军队立即撤出刚果包括基托纳和卡米纳基地，以及在刚果的“联合国军”只同刚果唯一合法的政府接触。他还要求就“联合国军”在刚果的活动向刚果政府定期提出报告。
    这位刚果总理说，刚果政府授权他在联合国以外寻求军事或其他援助，如果他的要求在联合国安全理事会会议上得不到满足的话。
    卢蒙巴同时表示：尽管他对联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德失去信任，但他信任联合国。
    卢蒙巴在记者招待会上还谴责比利时用萨贝那航空公司的飞机把间谍从布拉柴维尔空运到刚果。同时，他指责法国侵犯刚果领空和主权，用一架飞机把间谍运到开赛省的路路阿堡。他还说，比利时和法国把武器偷运到开赛省，企图制造分裂。
    卢蒙巴说，有十五名比利时伞兵在阴谋乘船潜入刚果马塔迪港时被捕，现在正押来利奥波德维尔审讯。消息表明，“联合国军”20日在刚果首都利奥波德维尔公然无视刚果政府的权力，庇护一名比利时殖民者罪犯。
    这个罪犯是比利时萨贝那航空公司副经理迪乌。20日上午，他在刚果法庭上受审后应当回到监狱，但他逃到了那里的法国大使馆躲藏起来。当刚果当局派遣宪兵、警察及军队前往法国大使馆要求交出这名罪犯时，装备着手提机关枪的“联合国部队”立即赶往这个大使馆，保护这名罪犯。
    据报道，迪乌的罪状是进行反对刚果政府的阴谋活动和故意命令他的航空公司的原定飞往开赛省路路阿堡的一架飞机转飞到加丹加省伊利沙伯维尔，让加丹加省分裂“政府”当局逮捕了这架飞机上的两名刚果民族运动党的人员。
    据新华社20日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：无视刚果政府提出归还机场控制权的正当要求，“联合国军”继续霸占刚果首都恩吉利机场，并且在19日把驻扎在那里的“联合国部队”的数量增加了六倍。
    据德意志新闻社报道：在刚果的“联合国代表”同刚果政府之间的关系“已冷却到接近零度”。
    “联合国部队”在机场的四周修筑战壕、架起铁丝网，并且建立了阵地。据法新社说，这些联合国部队19日整天都“处于战争状态”。他们在从恩吉利机场通向利奥波德维尔长达二十五公里的公路上布置了岗哨。拿着上了刺刀的步枪的这些“联合国”士兵，在公路上阻挡刚果士兵前往机场执行职务，并且严格“检查”进入机场的刚果人。
    “联合国军”这次加强在恩吉利机场的备战措施，是在18日上午这个机场上的刚果士兵反击了一批蛮横的“联合国军”的加拿大军官和士兵之后采取的。当天晚上，联合国副秘书长、美国人本奇就这次事件发表了一个诬蔑性的声明，并且威胁说任何再次“骚扰”他的人员的行为都是“不可容忍的”。这个美国人还要求刚果电台转播他的声明。但是，刚果电台根据刚果总理卢蒙巴的命令拒绝了他的要求。
    据伊利沙伯维尔消息，美国控制下的“联合国部队”源源不断地开入资源丰富的刚果加丹加省。19日，三架巨型美国“全球霸王”式运输机，又把一支将近二百名的“联合国部队”空运到加丹加省省会伊利沙伯维尔。据估计，联合国在这个省的兵力已经增加到四千人。
    消息还说，戴蓝色钢盔的“联合国部队”19日同冲伯“政府”的警察一起在伊利沙伯维尔“巡逻”。同时，另一支“联合国部队”在反对殖民主义、反对冲伯分裂阴谋的斗争高涨的地区——加丹加省北部的一些据点，进行“接管”。
    据新华社21日讯　纽约消息：为刚果人民所憎恨的美国籍联合国副秘书长本奇，已经无法再留在刚果从事反对刚果人民的阴谋活动了。联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德昨天不得不宣布：将把这个在刚果执行殖民主义政策的美国人调回纽约联合国总部。
    哈马舍尔德宣布，他任命了一个印度官员来代替这个美国人。这个印度官员是印度现任驻巴基斯坦高级专员拉杰希瓦尔·达雅尔。达雅尔1958年曾担任过联合国派驻黎巴嫩的三人观察小组成员。
