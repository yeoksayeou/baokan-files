    Save on Non-Productive Expenses, Use Fewer Non-Productive Personnel
    Practice Diligence and Thrift to Accelerate Production Development
    Beijing Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant Completes Full-Year Pig Iron Production Plan Ahead of Schedule
    (Our newspaper reports) The Beijing Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant adheres to the policy of running the enterprise diligently and thriftily, making every effort to save on non-productive expenditures, reducing non-productive capital construction and personnel, and concentrating manpower, materials, and financial resources on developing production. In the first half of this year, the plant's output of pig iron, silicon iron, and steel increased by one time, 3.7 times, and 3.5 times respectively compared to the same period last year. By the end of July, the plant's pig iron output had completed the full year's state plan ahead of schedule. Entering August, it overfulfilled the pig iron production plan for the first ten days of the month, increasing by 13.4% compared to the same period last month.
    This iron and steel plant, which has nine small blast furnaces and four converters and electric furnaces, was built in 1958 using old bricks from the city walls on a reed pond overgrown with weeds. Now all the employees of the plant still maintain the spirit of hard work and simplicity from the time the plant was built. The factory offices are still mainly the sheds left over from the construction of the factory, and they repair and paint them wherever they are broken. They work in such offices and still handle the plant's production and other work quite well. The plant's nurseries, barbershops, clubs, etc., also pay attention to thrift, ensuring that things are done well while spending less money. The plant's non-productive expenses continue to decline. Compared to April of this year, office expenses and travel expenses decreased by about half in July.
    Although the plant's production has developed rapidly, non-productive personnel have increased very little. In February of last year, more than twenty office cadres out of the plant's one hundred or so cadres were sent to workshops and the forefront of production to expand the strength of the forefront of production. This year, with further development of production, the plant increased the necessary offices according to needs, but the proportion of cadres in the plant's total workforce decreased from 4.7% last year to 4.5%. Their method is to implement concurrent posts, reduce unnecessary tasks, streamline meetings, and improve working methods under the principle that cadres at all levels go deep into the forefront of production, so that a few people can do more things.
    In the process of running the enterprise diligently and thriftily, this plant has not been without ideological struggles. At the beginning of the plant's construction, a few employees thought that their plant was small and weak, so they had to make do with saving. Later, when the plant expanded and became like a large factory, some people proposed that the plant build a movie theater and buy a movie projector, etc. The plant's Party committee promptly conducted education on this kind of thinking, explaining that there were many movie theaters in the city and there was no need to set up their own. They also organized employees to study relevant documents and launched a free airing of views and debates. Through the debates, the majority of employees further realized that running all undertakings diligently and thriftily is one of the basic guidelines for socialist construction and is a fine tradition of the Party. Everyone posted many big-character posters on increasing production and practicing economy, greatly promoting the atmosphere of loving the plant as a home and building the country diligently and thriftily. Based on the opinions of the masses, the plant strengthened financial management. The deputy secretary of the Party committee and the deputy director personally checked expenditures, and non-productive construction that could be avoided, reduced, or postponed was avoided or postponed as much as possible. The plant has many female workers and many children need to be cared for, so the personnel section, the general affairs section, and the workers tried to repair the old sheds, bought some old beds, and cleaned them up to set up a factory nursery. Cadres and workers also used their own hands to fill in the reed pits around the factory, build roads and squares themselves, and establish simple living service departments, barbershops, etc., which the employees were very satisfied with.
    While advocating saving on non-productive expenditures, this plant particularly emphasized increasing production. They adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to carry out a comprehensive technical transformation of all the plant's small blast furnaces diligently and thriftily. Previously, the wind temperature and wind pressure of the No. 3 Red Flag Furnace could not be increased, which affected high yield. Some people thought that it was necessary to add a hot blast stove and a blower, but the secretary of the plant's Party committee and the workers studied together, increased the air inlet pipe and outlet, changed the hot blast stove's rotary air inlet to a wavy type, reduced wind resistance, and increased wind pressure. Without adding new equipment, the daily output of this blast furnace increased sharply from thirteen tons to twenty-two tons. With a substantial increase in production, the demand for raw materials increased, so the employees took various measures to save raw materials. They cooperated with scientific research institutions and adopted the "three-in-one" method of cadres, workers, and technicians to make ore washing machines with very little steel, refine the ore, and use indigenous methods to make sintered ore from the washed ore powder for use in blast furnaces, which not only rationally utilized raw materials and reduced the consumption of iron ore, but also increased pig iron production, and also achieved spending less or no money. Previously, coke had to be transported twice within the plant before it could enter the furnace. Due to repeated loading and unloading and vehicle pressure, a lot was wasted. After the plant's Party committee discovered this problem, it immediately sent cadres to work with the material yard to help find ways to reduce one loading and unloading operation and formulate a management system, which not only ensured the supply to the blast furnace, but also saved twenty laborers and twenty-six transport vehicles every day. The plant also adopted the method of directly loading blast furnace molten iron into converters for steelmaking, saving a cupola furnace and fifteen laborers, and used small blast furnace gas to burn boilers, saving a lot of raw coal. In addition, the plant carried out comprehensive utilization of raw materials, using slag to make cement, self-producing chemical products, etc., which also greatly promoted the overall leap forward in production.

    节约非生产性开支　少用非生产人员
    克勤克俭加速生产发展
    北京宣武钢铁厂提前完成全年生铁生产计划
    本报讯　北京宣武钢铁厂坚持勤俭办企业的方针，千方百计节约非生产性开支，减少非生产性的基本建设和人员，集中人力、物力、财力发展生产。今年上半年，这个厂生铁、矽铁和钢的产量分别比去年同期提高一倍、三点七倍和三点五倍。到7月底，全厂的生铁产量已提前完成了全年的国家计划。进入8月，又超额完成上旬生铁生产计划，比上月同期提高13.4％。
    这个拥有九座小高炉和四座转炉、电炉的钢铁厂，是1958年用城墙上的旧砖，在一个野草丛生的苇塘上兴建起来的。现在全厂职工仍然保持着建厂时那种艰苦朴素的作风。工厂办公室主要还是建厂时留下的工棚，哪里破了就修补粉刷一下，他们在这样的办公室里办公，也照样把全厂的生产等工作办得相当出色。厂里的托儿所、理发室、俱乐部等，也都注意节俭，事情要办好，钱要花得少。全厂非生产性开支不断下降，今年7月跟今年4月相比，办公费、出差费就减少了一半左右。
    工厂的生产虽然飞跃发展，但非生产人员却增加得很少。去年2月，全厂一百多名干部中有二十多名科室干部下放到车间和生产第一线，扩充生产第一线的力量。今年，生产进一步发展了，工厂根据需要增加了必要的科室，但干部占全厂职工的比数却由去年的4.7％下降到4.5％。他们的办法就是在各级干部深入生产第一线的原则下，实行兼职、缩减不必要的事务，精简会议，改进工作方法等，由少数人办更多的事。
    这个工厂在勤俭办企业的过程中并不是没有思想斗争的。开始办厂时，有少数职工认为自己厂小，力量薄弱，只好将就节约些。后来工厂扩大像个大工厂了，于是有人就提议工厂盖个电影院、买电影机等。工厂党委针对这种思想及时进行了教育，说明城内电影院很多，不需要自己搞一套。并组织职工学习有关文件，展开鸣放辩论。通过辩论，广大职工进一步认识到勤俭办一切事业是社会主义建设的基本方针之一，是党的优良传统，大家贴出了许多增产节约的大字报，使爱厂如家、勤俭建国的风气大大发扬。根据群众意见，工厂加强了财务管理，党委副书记、副厂长亲自检查开支，可以不办、少办或缓办的非生产性的建设，尽量想法不办或缓办。厂里女工多，有许多儿童要入托，人事科、总务科和工人们想法把旧工棚修了修，买了些旧床，收拾收拾，就办了一个工厂托儿所。干部和工人还用自己的双手，填平工厂周围的苇坑，自己兴修马路、广场，建立了简易生活服务部、理发室等，职工都很满意。
    在提倡节约非生产性开支的同时，这个厂特别强调增加生产。他们采取土洋结合的办法，克勤克俭地对全厂小高炉进行了全面的技术改造。以前三号红旗炉风温风压提不高，影响高产，有人认为非增添热风炉和鼓风机不可，但是工厂党委书记和工人们一起研究，加大了进风管道和出风口，把热风炉回旋式进风改为波浪式，减小风的阻力，提高了风压，没有增加新设备，就使这座高炉的日产量由十三吨猛增到二十二吨。生产大幅度增长，原料材料需要量大，职工们就采取各种措施节约原料材料。他们和科学研究机关合作，采取干部、工人、技术员“三结合”的办法，用很少的钢材制成矿石淘洗机，将矿石加以精选，并把洗选出来的矿粉用土法制成烧结矿，供高炉使用，既合理利用原料，降低了铁矿石的消耗，又增加了生铁产量，而且做到了少花钱或不花钱。以前焦炭在厂内要经过两次运输才能入炉，由于多次装卸和车压人踩，浪费很多。工厂党委发现这个问题后，立即派干部到料场跟班劳动，帮助设法减少了一次装卸作业，制订了管理制度，既保证了对高炉的供应，每天又节约了二十个劳动力和二十六辆运输大车。这个厂还采取高炉铁水直接装入转炉炼钢的办法，省去一个冲天炉和十五个劳动力，并把小高炉煤气利用来烧锅炉，节省了大量原煤。此外，全厂开展了原料综合利用，用炉渣做水泥，自产化工产品等，也大大促进了生产的全面跃进。（附图片）
