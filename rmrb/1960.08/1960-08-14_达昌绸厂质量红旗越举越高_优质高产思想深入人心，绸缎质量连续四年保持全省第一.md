    The Dachang Silk Factory's Quality Red Flag Flies Higher and Higher
    High-Quality, High-Yield Thought Deeply Rooted in People's Hearts, Silk Quality Continues to Rank First in the Province for Four Consecutive Years
    (Our report) The Dachang Silk Factory in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, has maintained its first-place ranking in silk quality throughout the province for four consecutive years. This year, based on this advanced level, it has further improved the quality of silk, making it even better and higher.
    The Dachang Silk Factory was originally an old factory with outdated equipment. Most of its silk weaving machines were forty or fifty years old, and it had many new apprentices. However, since 1956, its first-class product rate has consistently remained the highest in the province, reaching 96.6% in 1958, ranking first in the country. By the end of last year, it reached 100% and comprehensively overfulfilled the national plan for six major indicators. This year, it has further improved quality, achieving an outstanding result of reducing the average zero silk rate to 0.29% in the first half of the year.
    The factory's Party General Branch frequently conducts education for workers on improving quality and comprehensively completing the national plan, using the spirit of continuous revolution, focusing on the central tasks of each period. This ensures that the idea of high-quality and high-yield is implemented in every job. Now, even if a decrease of one ten-thousandth in quality is found on the quality inspection bulletin board, the workers regard it as a serious matter, consciously convene meetings to study solutions, help each other, and improve together.
    At the beginning of this year, some people thought that quality improvement had reached its peak, arguing that it could not possibly be improved to 101%. The factory's Party General Branch promptly lectured the workers on the advanced situation of production in the same industry, pointing out that eleven factories in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Huzhou, and Shanghai had already reached 100%, and Dachang was not unique. They also pointed out that another quality indicator, the zero silk rate, could be further reduced. Just then, the Hangzhou Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory sent a new challenge, proposing a zero silk rate target of 0.2%. The Party General Branch of the Dachang Silk Factory immediately called on all workers to maintain their honor and advance victoriously. The workers' morale was high, and they were determined to make the quality even better. A new battle was launched vigorously.
    Factory leaders deeply grasped the quality situation by ranking varieties, problems, machines, personnel, and key points, and mobilized the masses to solve the problems that arose. For example, after ranking the defects that caused the zero silk rate, forty-eight topics were proposed and announced in the workshop corridor, with large red letters saying: "Recruiting heroes from the whole factory to fully attack the quality key." Workers rushed to sign up, and all the topics were snapped up in two or three days. The whole factory held three rounds of public recruitment, solving many major production bottlenecks.
    The leading cadres of the Dachang Silk Factory go deep into the forefront of production, discover problems, and solve problems. This is another important experience for ensuring high-quality, high-yield, and low-consumption. When the factory first used rayon as a raw material to weave "rayon soft satin," the rayon brands were complex, with varying properties, and prone to defects. The factory sent people to other places to learn from their "experience." At the same time, the secretary, deputy factory director, and department cadres went to the workshop to work with the workers, checking layer by layer according to the process, observing carefully, and repeatedly measuring to understand the performance of rayon. In the rationalization proposal campaign, workers throughout the factory put forward many suggestions, and finally solved this key problem and improved quality.
    While vigorously launching mass movements and mobilizing all workers to focus on quality, the factory has established and adhered to various effective production management systems to ensure stable and continuous improvement in quality. From several years of production practice, workers have discovered five "gates" that have a major impact on silk quality: raw material ranking, sizing, winding, warping, and shuttle tying. They have established a complete set of systems for these five "gates," including raw material moisture protection for each process, dedicated machines and spindles, bobbin ranking, raw material sampling, cleaning work, and defect responsibility analysis. In the process of implementation, a combination of professional management and mass management is adopted, giving the production management system a broad mass base.

### 达昌绸厂质量红旗越举越高  优质高产思想深入人心，绸缎质量连续四年保持全省第一

    达昌绸厂质量红旗越举越高
    优质高产思想深入人心，绸缎质量连续四年保持全省第一
    本报讯　浙江省湖州市达昌绸厂绸缎质量连续四年保持全省第一。今年来，在这个先进水平的基础上，又做到了绸缎质量好了更好，高了更高。
    达昌绸厂原是一个厂房设备陈旧的工厂，大部分织绸机已有四、五十年历史，而且有不少新徒工。但是，从1956年以来，正品率始终保持全省第一，1958年达到96.6％，跃居全国第一，到去年底达到100％，并全面超额完成了六大指标的国家计划。今年进一步提高质量，取得了上半年平均零绸率降低到0.29％的优异成绩。
    这个厂的党总支经常围绕各个时期的中心任务，用不断革命的精神，向职工进行提高质量和全面完成国家计划的教育。使优质高产的思想贯彻在每一个工作中。现在，哪怕在质量检验公布牌上发现质量下降万分之一，职工们都看作是严重的事情，自觉地集会研究解决办法，互相帮助，共同提高。
    今年年初，曾有人认为提高质量到顶了，反正总不能提高到101％。厂党总支便及时地向职工大讲同行业生产跃进形势，指出当时杭州、苏州、湖州、上海已有十一个厂达到100％，达昌并不是独一无二的；而另一个质量指标零绸率则完全可以继续降低。恰好这时杭州都锦生丝织厂送来了新的战表，其中提出零绸率指标是0.2％，达昌绸厂党总支当即号召全体职工保持荣誉，乘胜前进。职工们情绪高涨，决心做到质量好了还要好。新的战斗就轰轰烈烈展开了。
    厂领导通过排品种、排问题、排机台、排人员、排关键等方法，深入地掌握质量情况，发动群众解决出现的问题。例如：经过对造成零绸率的病疵排队，提出四十八个课题，在车间走廊上公布，上面写起斗大的红字：“榜招全厂英雄好汉，全力攻打质量关键”。工人争先恐后地揭榜，二、三天内就抢完了全部课题。全厂一共举行了三次张榜招贤，解决了许多重大生产关键。
    达昌绸厂的领导干部深入生产第一线，发现问题，解决问题，是保证优质高产低消耗的又一条重要经验。当这个厂第一次用人造丝作原料织“人丝软缎”时，由于人造丝牌号复杂，性能不一，易出次品。工厂便一面派人到外地取“经”，一面由书记、副厂长、科室干部等下车间和工人一起劳动，按工序层层检查，仔细观察，反复测定，摸清人造丝的性能。全厂工人在合理化建议运动中，提出了许多建议，最后终于解决了这一关键，提高了质量。
    这个厂在大搞群众运动，发动职工人人动手抓质量的同时，建立和坚持了各种行之有效的生产管理制度，保证质量稳定并不断提高。从几年来的生产实践中，职工们摸索出对绸缎质量起重大影响的有五个“关”，这就是：原料排队、机浆、摇纡、整经、扎梭。他们便针对这五个“关”建立了道道工序原料保燥、专机专锭、纡子排队、原料试样、清洁工作、病疵责任分析等一整套的制度。在执行过程中，又采取专业管理和群众管理相结合的办法，使生产管理制度具有广泛的群众基础。
