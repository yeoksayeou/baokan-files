    Yao Mountain Peddler Team
    Hunan Lanjia Li Menglan
    Yao Mountain soars into the clouds, the cloud sea billows and churns,
    Cliffs hang overhead, mountain eagles circle below.
    The peddler team climbs mountains and crosses ridges,
    Arriving at our remote mountain village.
    You've worked hard, comrades!
    Welcome, comrades!
    You brought fertilizer,
    The paddy fields are full of golden rice ears.
    You brought farming tools,
    The cotton fields are covered with silver-like bolls.
    You brought cloth,
    The young girls are adorned in colorful clothes.
    You brought oil and salt,
    The cafeteria's dishes are fragrant and delicious.
    You brought milk candies,
    The Yao children are fair and chubby.
    You brought kerosene,
    The village lights shine brightly.
    Thank you, hard-working salespersons!
    Grateful to you, logistics soldiers who deliver goods to the deep mountains!
    It is you who have brought
    Chairman Mao's boundless warmth,
    The Communist Party's profound kindness.
    It is you who have brought
    Good news to the remote mountain areas,
    Happiness and joy to the Yao people.
