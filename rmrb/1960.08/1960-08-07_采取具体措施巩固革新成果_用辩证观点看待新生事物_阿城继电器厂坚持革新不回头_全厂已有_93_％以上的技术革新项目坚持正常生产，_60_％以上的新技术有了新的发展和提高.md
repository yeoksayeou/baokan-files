    Adopt Specific Measures to Consolidate the Results of Innovation　Use a Dialectical View to Look at New Things
    Acheng Relay Factory Persists in Innovation Without Turning Back
    More than 93% of the plant's technical innovation projects maintain normal production, and more than 60% of new technologies have new developments and improvements
    (According to Harbin Daily) In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the Acheng Relay Factory in Harbin, with the attitude of a revolutionary, correctly recognized the new contradictions of new things, carried out meticulous ideological and organizational work, and practically solved practical problems, greatly promoting the further development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement and the great leap forward in production.
    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations," the factory created and reformed more than 7,000 mechanical, semi-mechanical, automated, and semi-automated equipment, as well as new technologies and processes. As the movement developed in depth and breadth, some new problems also emerged: First, workers could not yet master and use new technologies well. Second, the newly created mechanized and automated equipment was not perfect enough, and its operation was abnormal after being put into production. Third, some machine tools, after being automated, could only produce a single product or specification, and their utilization efficiency was low.
    Faced with the imperfect situation of new things just emerging, some cadres developed the erroneous idea of "going backward." The factory's Party committee believed that this idea only saw the phenomenon of things and did not see the essence of things. To this end, they first widely organized the vast number of cadres and workers to study documents such as "How Marxists Treat New Things," "The Theory of Continuous Revolution," and "Give Full Play to Subjective Initiative," and launched employees to conduct great airing, great contention, and great debate on topics such as "What to do if new technologies are imperfect" and "How to master new technologies." Through study and debate, the ideological understanding of cadres and employees has been greatly improved.
    The factory's Party committee believes that the consolidation, promotion, development, and improvement of technical innovation and technical revolution is a very complex task, and it is not enough to rely on general appeals. Leading cadres must go deep into production and solve practical problems with the masses in a down-to-earth manner. To this end, the factory's Party secretary, director, and other main leading cadres all divided their forces and went deep into various workshops to grasp key issues. The first automated workshop of this factory has thirteen hexagonal lathes, which have been automated. Originally, only seven could produce normally. Some people once advocated restoring the remaining six from automation to the old method. At that time, the struggle was very fierce, and the focus of the struggle was "whether to go backward." The secretary of the factory Party committee personally came here to "sit in command." He and the masses worked together to find the reasons why some automated machine tools were not working well, and organized everyone to conduct repeated debates and experiments, and finally solved this problem, making all thirteen automated hexagonal lathes operate normally. The six pressures in the standard parts workshop were originally all manual operations, and the labor intensity was very high. This time, they were changed to friction pressure, which reduced physical labor, but the workers were unwilling to use it. After the leading cadres went deep into the masses to understand, they found that although the reform reduced physical labor, the labor efficiency was lower than manual operation, and the workers did not use it in order to produce more. The leading cadres studied with the masses to change the friction pressure to electric pressure, which not only reduced physical labor but also improved labor efficiency, so that the manual operation that had been used for more than ten years was truly mechanized. Leading cadres at all levels went to the front line and solved key problems with the workers, pointed out the direction for the masses, strengthened their courage, and boosted their morale. Many workers said: When leading cadres come, all problems can be solved.
    In order to help workers master new technologies, the factory adopted methods such as holding technical lectures, master-apprentice mentoring, on-site teaching, and carrying out technical performance competitions, and launching the "excellent operator" production campaign to open more machine tools, produce higher output, better quality, and more improvements, raise red flags, and set up pacesetters. Due to the adoption of this set of methods, the technical level of workers has been rapidly improved. At present, more than 95% of workers have mastered new technologies, and more than 60% of workers can repair and maintain machine tools, greatly promoting the improvement of production.
    Because this factory carried out meticulous ideological and organizational work in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and practically solved some practical problems in the movement, the existing technical revolution achievements have been consolidated, promoted, developed, and improved. At present, more than 93% of the factory's technical innovation and technical revolution projects are maintaining normal production, and more than 60% of new technologies have new developments and improvements. Sixty-five automated single machines and five automated production lines have achieved multi-functionality for one machine and multi-purpose for one line, and the variety of processed parts has been expanded from seventy-one to one hundred and sixty.

    采取具体措施巩固革新成果　用辩证观点看待新生事物
    阿城继电器厂坚持革新不回头
    全厂已有93％以上的技术革新项目坚持正常生产，60％以上的新技术有了新的发展和提高
    据哈尔滨日报消息：哈尔滨阿城继电器厂在技术革新、技术革命运动中，以革命者的姿态，正确认识新事物的新矛盾，深入细致地作好各项思想、组织工作，踏踏实实地解决实际问题，大大促进了技术革新、技术革命运动的进一步发展和生产的大跃进。
    这个厂在以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动中，创造和改革了机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的设备和新技术、新工艺等达七千多项。随着运动向深广发展，也出现了一些新的问题：一、工人对新技术还不能很好地掌握、运用。二、新创造的机械化、自动化设备本身还不够完善，投入生产后，运转不正常。三、有的机床实现自动化后，只能生产单一产品或规格，使用效率较低。
    面对着新事物刚一出现还不够完善的情况，有的干部产生了“走回头路”的错误思想。工厂党委认为这种思想是只看到了事物的现象，没有看到事物的本质。为此，他们首先广泛地组织了广大干部、工人学习“马克思主义者如何对待新生事物”、“不断革命论”、“充分发挥主观能动作用”等文件，并发动职工以“新技术不完善怎么办”、“如何掌握新技术”等为题，进行大鸣、大放、大辩论。通过学习、辩论，大大提高了干部与职工的思想认识。
    工厂党委认为，技术革新、技术革命的巩固、推广、发展、提高，是一项十分复杂的工作，光凭一般号召是不够的，领导干部必须深入到生产中去，和群众一道，踏踏实实地解决实际问题。为此，工厂的党委书记、厂长等主要领导干部，都分兵把口，深入到各个车间去，抓关键问题。这个厂第一自动化车间，有十三台六角车床，实现了自动化，原来只有七台能正常生产，曾有人主张把其余六台由自动化还原为老一套的干法，当时，斗争很激烈，而斗争的焦点是“走不走回头路”，工厂党委书记就亲自到这里来“坐阵”，他和群众一起查找部分自动化机床不好使的原因，组织大家进行反复辩论、试验，终于解决了这一问题，使十三台自动化六角车床全部正常开动。标准件车间六台压力，原来全部是手工操作，劳动强度很大，这次改为摩擦压力，减轻了体力劳动，但工人也不愿意用。经过领导干部深入到群众中去了解，才发现改革后虽然减轻了体力劳动，但劳动效率比手工操作低，工人们为了多生产才不用的。领导干部就与群众一起研究，把摩擦压力改为电压力，既减轻了体力劳动，又提高了劳动效率，使沿用了十多年的手工操作，真正实现了机械化。各级领导干部上前线，和职工一起解决关键，给群众指了方向，壮了胆子，鼓了干劲。很多工人都说：领导干部来了，啥问题都能解决。
    为了帮助工人掌握新技术，工厂采取了举办技术讲座，师傅带徒弟，现场教学，开展技术表演赛等方法和开展比开动机床多、产量高、质量好、改进多的“优等操作手”生产运动会，举红旗，树标兵。由于采取了这一套方法，迅速地提高了工人的技术水平，到目前已有95％以上的工人掌握了新技术，并有60％以上的工人能够检修、维护机床，大大促进了生产的提高。
    由于这个厂在技术革新、技术革命运动中，深入细致地作了思想、组织工作，踏踏实实地解决了运动中的一些实际问题，因此使已有的技术革命成果得到了巩固、推广、发展、提高。到目前，全厂有93％以上的技术革新、技术革命项目坚持正常生产，并有60％以上的新技术，又有了新的发展、提高，六十五台自动化单机和五条自动化生产线达到一机多能、一线多用，加工零件品种由七十一种扩大到一百六十种。
