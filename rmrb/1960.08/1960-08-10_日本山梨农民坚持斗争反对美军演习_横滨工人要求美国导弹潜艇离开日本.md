Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th August: Japanese farmers in Yamanashi Prefecture, at the northern foot of Mount Fuji, are intensifying their struggle against US military exercises in the area and demanding the return of land occupied by the North Fuji shooting range.

According to a report in today's "Asahi Shimbun," the US military is scheduled to conduct target practice exercises at this shooting range from August 7th to 13th. Four hundred US soldiers, accompanied by twenty field guns, arrived there yesterday morning.

Today, fifty farmers entered the target area of the shooting range, joining fifteen others who have been holding a sit-in demonstration there for ten days since July 29th. Holding flags and banners, they expressed their determination to prevent the US military exercises. A mounted team of twelve people, carrying flags reading "Demand the Return of Fuji," demonstrated in front of a row of cannons belonging to the US military exercise troops.

To support the farmers' struggle, the Yamanashi Prefecture Federation of Trade Unions has proposed joint action.

On August 6th, Yasuda Toshio and Abe Takematsu, Socialist Party members of the House of Representatives, along with ten farmers' representatives from Oshino Village in Yamanashi Prefecture, went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest the US military exercises. They submitted a letter of protest to the Foreign Minister, demanding that the government take measures to stop the US military exercises.

The US military and the Japanese police authorities are colluding to take repressive measures. It is reported that the US armed forces and the Japanese police authorities held a joint meeting to discuss so-called "measures to maintain public order." The Japanese police authorities have issued notices threatening the farmers and demanding that they withdraw from the shooting range.

The farmers of Yamanashi Prefecture are prepared to persist in their struggle. According to the organization leading the struggle, on August 10th, the day when the struggle will reach its climax, one hundred "dare-to-die" members will hold demonstrations at the shooting range. At the same time, they will expand the bonfire demonstrations that began last night, increasing the number of bonfires to forty or fifty.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th August: The Yokohama Port Workers' Union Federation, with 20,000 members, issued a statement on August 6th demanding that the Japanese government take steps to have the US missile submarine "Halibut" leave Japan immediately.

The statement also demanded that the government prohibit any ships capable of carrying nuclear warheads from entering Japanese waters.

A US Navy spokesman was forced to admit on August 6th that a US missile submarine "Halibut," capable of launching nuclear rockets, is currently docked at the Yokosuka base, south of Yokohama, Japan.

The spokesman also admitted: "Other submarines capable of launching nuclear warhead rockets frequently dock at Yokosuka."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th August: The Fukuoka Prefecture Joint Struggle Council Against the "Security Treaty" held a meeting today and adopted a plan to strengthen the movement against the Japan-US military alliance treaty, against US military bases, and in support of the Miike coal miners' struggle.

According to the plan, the organization will center on the trade unions of workers employed by the US military and launch a nationwide struggle against the "Self-Defense Forces" and demanding the removal of US military bases, and demand that the United States withdraw RB-47 spy planes from Japan.

At the same time, in order to strengthen the struggle against the new "Security Treaty" in rural areas, the prefectural joint struggle council will convene a meeting of rural activists on the 20th.

In order to support the long-term struggle of the Miike coal miners in this prefecture against mass layoffs, the meeting decided that various mass organizations and trade unions in Fukuoka Prefecture will continue to submit requests to the government's Central Labor Relations Commission regarding the absolute rejection of the demand to designate 1,200 people for dismissal. At the same time, the meeting called on various mass organizations and trade unions to do their best to prepare for combat so that they can immediately launch strikes and other forms of forceful struggle in the event of an emergency.

    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本富士山北麓山梨县农民反对美军在那里进行军事演习和要求归还北富士射击场所占用的土地的斗争，今天达到了新的高潮。
    据“朝日新闻”今天报道，美军预定从8月7日到13日在这个射击场举行打靶演习。美军四百名随带野战炮二十门已经在昨天上午到达那里。
    今天，有农民五十人进入这个射击场的目标区，同自7月29日起在那里举行十天静坐示威的十五人会合。他们举着旗帜和标语牌，表示要决死阻止美军的军事演习。还有由十二人组成的骑马队，举着上面写着“要求归还富士”的旗帜，在美军演习部队的一排大炮前面举行示威。
    为了支援农民的斗争，山梨县工会联合会已提出了共同斗争的建议。
    众议院社会党议员安田敏雄、阿部竹松和山梨县忍野村的农民代表十人6日曾前往外务省就美军演习事提出抗议。他们把抗议书提交外务相，要求政府采取措施使美国军队停止军事演习。
    美军和日本警察当局正在合谋采取镇压措施。据报道，美国武装部队和日本警察当局举行了联席会议，讨论所谓“维护公共治安的措施”。日本警察当局已经发出通告威胁农民们，要他们撤出射击场。
    山梨县的农民准备坚持斗争。据领导斗争的组织说，在本月10日斗争将达到最高潮的这一天，将有敢死队员一百人在射击场举行示威，同时要扩大从昨天晚间开始举行的篝火示威，使燃起的篝火增加到四十到五十处。

    美国海军发言人6日曾经被迫承认一艘能够发射核火箭的美国导弹潜水艇“灰鲸号”目前正停泊在日本横滨以南的横须贺基地。
    这个发言人还承认：“能够发射核弹头火箭的其他潜水艇经常地在横须贺停泊”。

    同时，为了加强农村的反对新“安全条约”的斗争，这个县的共同斗争会议将于20日召开农村积极分子会议。
    为了支持这个县里的三池煤矿工人正在进行的反对大批解雇的长期斗争，会议决定，福冈县的各个群众组织和工会继续向政府的中央劳动委员会提出关于绝对不承认指定解雇一千二百人的要求。会议同时呼吁各个群众组织和工会要尽力做好战斗准备，以便当发生紧急事态时，能够立即展开罢工等实力斗争。
