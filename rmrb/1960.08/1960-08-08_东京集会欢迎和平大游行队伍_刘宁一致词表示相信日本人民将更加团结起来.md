Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 7th: A grand rally was held in Tokyo's Hibiya Open-Air Music Hall on the evening of the 5th, attended by 15,000 people from all walks of life in Japan, to welcome the victorious convergence in Tokyo of the five routes of the Peace March.

Amidst sustained applause, representatives of the various Japanese marching contingents marched into the venue in a mighty procession, holding high banners against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, against nuclear armament, and against U.S. military bases.

Representatives who participated in the march reported to the assembly on the facts and feelings they encountered along the way. These impassioned and vivid reports, like recited poems, were moving and captivating.

Higa Hideji, the representative from Okinawa who marched all the way from Yoron Island, north of the U.S. military base in Okinawa, to Tokyo, emphasized that the people of Okinawa had launched a strong demonstration to oppose Eisenhower's activities in Okinawa. The struggle of the people of mainland Japan finally prevented Eisenhower's visit to Japan and brought down the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. Higa called on the participants to strengthen their confidence and fight bravely for the abolition of the new "Security Treaty" and the withdrawal of U.S. military bases.

Nakasawa Hiroya, who marched from Nemuro, Hokkaido, to Tokyo, emphasized that when they arrived in Hakodate, 6,000 citizens held a meeting to warmly welcome them and unanimously passed a resolution firmly stating that they would absolutely not fight against Asians. He said that the Japanese people, in particular, must prevent the revival of Japanese militarism and not allow Japan to repeat the crimes of aggression against China and the Soviet Union.

Maeda Haruyo, a resident of Niijima who is engaged in a heroic struggle against the "Defense Agency's" establishment of a missile launch site on Niijima, said that the residents of Niijima are resolutely struggling to prevent the establishment of nuclear weapons bases near Tokyo and to prevent Japan's nuclear armament.

Sato Kunio, a worker representative from Nagano City, said that through participating in the Peace March, he personally experienced the importance of Japanese workers and farmers uniting to launch a common struggle, which is a reliable guarantee for the victory of the Japanese people's struggle.

Yokoi Kameo from Hiroshima pointed out that the American representatives who participated in the Peace March were warmly welcomed by the Japanese people, while Eisenhower's visit to Japan did not materialize. This shows that the Japanese people will only welcome friends and will never welcome warmongers like Eisenhower.

Izumisawa Eiji, a representative from Niigata Prefecture, pointed out that although the Peace March has ended victoriously, the struggle is just beginning. He stated that he would continue to make efforts at the Sixth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament, which begins on the 6th.

With these speeches by the marching representatives against nuclear weapons and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," cheers and applause constantly rang out in the venue, demonstrating the Japanese people's firm will to strive for final victory.

Delegations from various countries attending the World Conference were invited to attend the welcoming rally. Representatives from the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and Kenya addressed the meeting, expressing their support for the struggle of the Japanese people.

Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation, said in his speech that the people of China and Japan face a common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and need to unite and support each other. He pointed out that the friendly aspirations of the people of China and Japan cannot be obstructed or undermined by any reactionary force. The Chinese people support the just struggle of the Japanese people to abolish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, to not allow the revival of militarism, and to demand that Japan become a peaceful, independent, democratic, and neutral country.

Liu Ningyi said that the Japanese people are facing a very favorable situation, the forces of peace are growing stronger day by day, and the imperialist war forces are becoming more isolated day by day. Their lifespan will not be long. He expressed his firm belief that the Japanese people will become more united in the future and continuously achieve new victories.

Each of Liu Ningyi's speeches aroused thunderous applause and cheers, and the venue repeatedly boiled over.

This welcoming rally was also a rally for struggle. The venue was filled with a warm, high-spirited, and solemn atmosphere. (Attached picture)

    东京集会欢迎和平大游行队伍
    刘宁一致词表示相信日本人民将更加团结起来
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本各界一万五千人5日晚间在东京日比谷露天音乐堂举行盛大集会，欢迎五路和平大游行队伍胜利会师东京。
    日本各路游行队伍代表在经久不息的掌声中高举着反对日美军事同盟、反对核武装、反对美军基地的旗帜浩浩荡荡地走进会场。
    参加大游行的各位代表纷纷把他们在沿途所遇到的事实和感受向大会作了报告。这些慷慨激昂、生动活泼的报告，像朗诵诗篇一样，动人心弦，引人入胜。
    从美军冲绳基地北部与论岛出发一直走到东京的冲绳代表比嘉秀次强调说，冲绳人民为反对艾森豪威尔到冲绳活动，展开了强有力的示威游行。日本内地人民的斗争终于阻止了艾森豪威尔访日，打倒了岸信介内阁。比嘉呼吁与会者坚定信心，为争取废除新“安全条约”和撤销美国军事基地而英勇奋斗。
    从北海道根室游行到东京的中泽博也强调说，当他们走到函馆时，六千名市民举行大会，热情地迎接他们，并且一致通过决议，坚决表示绝对不同亚洲人打仗。他说，日本人民尤其是要阻止日本军国主义复活，不让日本重犯侵略中国和苏联的罪行。
    和平大游行中的妇女代表、为反对“防卫厅”在新岛设立导弹发射场而进行着英勇斗争的新岛居民前田春代说，新岛居民正在为阻止在东京附近建立核武器基地，阻止日本核武装化而进行着坚决的斗争。
    长野市工人代表佐藤久仁雄说，通过参加和平大游行，他亲身体验到日本工人和农民团结一致展开共同斗争的重要性，这是日本人民斗争取得胜利的可靠保证。
    从广岛来的横井龟夫指出，美国代表参加和平大游行受到了日本人民的热烈欢迎，而艾森豪威尔的访日却没有实现。这件事情表明，日本人民只会欢迎朋友，绝不会欢迎像艾森豪威尔那样的战争贩子。
    新澙县代表泉泽英司指出，和平大游行虽然已经胜利结束，但是斗争正在开始。他表示要在从6日开始的第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会上继续进行努力。
    随着这些反对核武器和日美“安全条约”的游行代表的讲话，会场上不断响起了欢呼声和掌声，显示出日本人民争取最后胜利的坚决意志。
    出席世界大会的各国代表团应邀出席了欢迎大会。苏联、中国、美国、怯尼亚代表在会上致词，表示支持日本人民的斗争。
    中国代表团团长刘宁一在致词中说，中日两国人民面临共同的敌人美帝国主义，需要团结和相互支援。他指出，中日两国人民的友好愿望是任何反动力量阻挠不了、破坏不了的。中国人民支持日本人民废除日美军事同盟条约、不允许军国主义复活，要求日本成为和平、独立、民主、中立的国家的正义斗争。
    刘宁一说，日本人民面临着非常有利的形势，和平的力量一天天强大，帝国主义战争势力一天天孤立，它们的寿命不会长久了。他表示坚信日本人民今后会更加团结起来，不断取得新的胜利。
    刘宁一的每一段讲话都引起雷鸣般的掌声和欢呼声，会场一再沸腾起来。
    这次欢迎大会，也是一次斗争大会，会场上一直充满着热烈、高涨和严肃的气氛。（附图片）
