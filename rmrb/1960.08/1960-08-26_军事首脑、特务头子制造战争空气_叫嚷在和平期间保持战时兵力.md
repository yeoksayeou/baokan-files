U.S. Imperialism's War Preparations Become Increasingly Rampant
	Military Chiefs and Intelligence Bosses Create War Atmosphere
	Clamoring to Maintain Wartime Strength During Peace
	The United States continues to intensify its arms race and war preparations worldwide, creating a war atmosphere.
	Lyman Lemnitzer, the Army Chief of Staff recently appointed to replace Twining as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, delivered a speech on the 23rd at the annual convention of the American Legion in Detroit, vigorously emphasizing the need for the United States to engage in "sustained military efforts." He proposed six "basic tasks" for the United States' "overall strategy" of arms expansion and war preparation: establishing a "retaliatory capability for strategic strikes," "stationing troops in friendly countries overseas," supporting allies through common security programs, "maintaining a strategic reserve that can be deployed to any region," "maintaining and utilizing transportation lines between the United States and any combat zone," and "maintaining the ability to expand the armed forces to the level required in wartime during peacetime."
	Air Force Chief of Staff White, in a recent interview with a reporter from "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, also strongly advocated for the United States to intensify its war preparations. He ferociously clamored that the United States must maintain a "deterrent force" and "devote a large portion of its efforts to military affairs to counter the Soviet Union." White advocated that the United States accelerate the development of missiles, long-range fighter-interceptors, and long-range bombers, and also promoted the development of more spy satellites to exploit outer space for America's "military interests." White also demanded the resumption of nuclear testing to accelerate the development of U.S. nuclear weapons. He believed that a "cessation of testing" would "slow down" America's war preparations and said that "there are several very important things that should be tested." White stated that the purpose of the United States' intensified arms expansion and war preparation is to threaten socialist countries and flaunt its military might to other countries. He emphasized that the United States must "display strength" to other countries, showing that the United States "is on guard and is taking action." He said, "I think this is equally important politically and militarily."
	U.S. intelligence chief Allen Dulles once again made anti-Soviet pronouncements on the 22nd, advocating for intensified arms expansion and war preparation. The director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, speaking at the 61st annual convention of the American Legion in Detroit, frantically clamored that the United States must "maintain our [referring to the U.S.] military strength" so that the Soviet Union would have "due respect for our [referring to the U.S.] military and retaliatory power." Allen Dulles admitted that the United States "has spent and is spending a lot of money and manpower on a lot of research work" to expand its arms and prepare for war. He emphasized that the United States will "continue to do so" and "should spare no effort."
	Referring to the Soviet Union's recent just trial of U-2 spy plane pilot Powers, the U.S. intelligence chief openly reiterated that the United States' criminal espionage activities against the Soviet Union "are indispensable."
	U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates also delivered a bellicose speech at the conference, boasting that the "strength" of the U.S. military "is no weaker than any country." He boasted that "confidence in our [U.S.] armed forces is itself one of the most important factors in the strength of the free world."

### 军事首脑、特务头子制造战争空气  叫嚷在和平期间保持战时兵力

    美帝国主义备战活动日益猖狂
    军事首脑、特务头子制造战争空气
    叫嚷在和平期间保持战时兵力
    美国继续在世界范围内加紧扩军备战活动、制造战争气氛。
    新被任命接替特文宁出任参谋长联席会议主席的陆军参谋长兰尼兹尔23日在底特律举行的美国退伍军人组织年会上发表演说，竭力强调美国要进行“持久的军事努力”。他提出了美国进行扩军备战的“总战略”的六个“基本任务”，这就是要建立一支“进行战略打击的报复能力”，“在海外的友好国家驻扎军队”，通过共同安全计划支持盟国”，“维持一支可以开往任何地区的战略后备”，“维持和运用美国和任何作战地区之间的交通线”以及“在和平期间保持着把武装部队扩大到战时所需要的水平的能力”等。
    空军参谋长怀特不久前对“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志记者发表谈话时，也大力鼓吹美国要加紧战争准备。他穷凶极恶地叫嚣，美国要保持“威慑力量”，“必须以一大部分努力用在军事方面来对付苏联”。怀特主张美国加紧发展导弹、远程战斗截击机和远程轰炸机，并且鼓吹多搞间谍卫星，利用外层空间来谋取美国的“军事利益”。怀特同时还要求恢复核试验，以加快美国的核武器发展。他认为“停止试验”就会使美国备战的“速度变慢”，又说“有若干非常重要的东西应该加以试验”。怀特表示，美国加紧进行扩军备战的目的是要对社会主义国家进行战争威胁以及对其他国家炫耀武力。他强调美国要对其他国家“显示力量”，表明美国“有所戒备并且是在采取行动”。他说，“我认为，这在政治上和军事上都同样是很重要的”。
    美国特务头子艾伦·杜勒斯22日又一次大发反苏叫嚣，鼓吹加紧扩军备战。这个美国中央情报局局长在底特律对退伍军人组织第六十一次年会上讲话时疯狂地叫嚷说，美国必须“保持我们的（指美国）军事力量”，“务使”苏联“对我们（指美国）的军事和报复力量怀有应有的尊重”。艾伦·杜勒斯承认美国“过去和现在都花了许多金钱和人力作了许多研究工作”来扩军备战，他强调美国今后仍“将会这样做”，并且“应该是不遗余力的”。
    在谈到苏联最近对美国U—2间谍飞机驾驶员鲍尔士的正义审判时，这个美国特务头子公然重申美国对苏联进行的罪恶的间谍活动“是必不可少的”。
    美国国防部长盖茨在这次会议上也发表了好战演说，吹嘘美国军队的“力量不弱于任何国家”。他吹牛说，“对我们（美国）武装部队的信心本身就是自由世界的实力的一个最重要的因素”。
