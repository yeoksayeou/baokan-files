Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 3rd: Akira Kazami, head of the Japanese delegation to the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament, delivered a detailed report at the conference preparatory meeting on the afternoon of August 2nd regarding the Japanese people's struggle for independence and peace.

Kazami first expressed his gratitude for the enthusiastic support given by the people of various countries to the Japanese people's struggle. He also said, "I am very pleased to tell you that this support has greatly encouraged the Japanese people's struggle."

He said, "One of the biggest problems we are now facing is the issue of the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'. This issue has attracted widespread attention from the Japanese people because it is closely related to their current and future lives."

He said, "First, this revised treaty will inevitably involve Japan in another war again. The new treaty requires Japan to cooperate with the United States in its Far East strategy. The Far East region in the treaty even implies including the territories of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. Of course, the treaty takes Japan's nuclear armament development for granted."

Kazami said, "Former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi repeatedly said that this treaty is a defensive treaty. But I would like to ask him, which of the touted military treaties is not said to be a defensive treaty? Obviously, what is currently threatening Japan's security is the United States, which has military bases on Japanese soil. Why is the establishment of military bases by the United States not an act of aggression? Japan, which was responsible for the outbreak of the Pacific War, signed a military defense treaty with Germany and Italy in 1937. The Japanese government at that time also claimed that the military treaty was a defensive treaty."

Kazami said, "Second, the spearhead of the new treaty is clearly aimed at Japan's neighboring countries in Asia. During World War II, Japanese imperialists invaded Asian countries, causing unspeakable suffering to the people of Asian countries. Today, the Japanese ruling class, with the support of U.S. imperialism, intends to invade Asia again."

He emphasized, "Japan is a member of Asia. Japan has no other way but to cooperate with Asian countries. When Japan opposes nationalism and Asian countries—including the socialist countries that are building a new world today—how can this country have a bright future?"

Kazami said, "Third, the purpose of the revised treaty is to suppress the movement for independence, peace, and democracy. Recently, the government has attempted to interfere in an increasingly arrogant manner and use violence to oppose the labor and peace movements. It can be foreseen that as a result of the revision of the Security Treaty, some reactionary laws will be enacted."

Kazami said, "We Japanese people desire peace and the independence of our country, and we have expressed our opposition to this military treaty. The struggle against the 'Security Treaty' that has been going on for more than a year has developed into the most gigantic struggle in Japanese history in terms of its breadth, depth, and intensity. Through this struggle, more than 2,000 joint struggle organizations have been formed throughout Japan, and people from all walks of life gathered around these organizations have participated in twenty-two unified actions." He said: The Japanese people will never forget the blood shed by many heroic demonstrators.

Kazami emphasized, "The Japanese and American governments claim that the revised treaty is valid. But all Japanese people who desire peace and national independence believe that this treaty is invalid. Not only that, but we are also determined to continue the struggle to abolish this treaty."

Kazami then reported to all the delegates on the valuable lessons learned by the Japanese people in this historic struggle. He said, "One of these lessons is that we must distinguish between our friends and our enemies. Recognize who is trying to provoke war? Who is oppressing and invading other countries? Through the movement against the 'Security Treaty', we Japanese people clearly realize that the new treaty was initiated by Japanese militarists with the support of U.S. imperialists. In order to finally abolish the 'Security Treaty' and achieve peace and independence, we must now organize unified action to oppose these forces. In doing so, we must clearly see these enemies who support the 'Security Treaty'."

Kazami emphasized, "We must not be deceived by their peaceful pretense, but do our best to isolate them. Almost every struggle shows that imperialists only yield when they suffer serious blows." He emphasized that in order to maintain peace, it is necessary to oppose military bases, oppose foreign troops stationed in other countries, and oppose military alliance treaties.

He said, "The Japanese people's struggle has been greatly inspired and encouraged by the struggles waged by the people of South Korea, Turkey, and Cuba. The fact that the Japanese people forced their government to cancel Eisenhower's visit has inspired the national liberation movements in Asian, African, and Latin American countries, and has won the support of peace-loving people all over the world. The Japanese people have never been so fully aware of the power of international solidarity as they are today, and they are happy to be able to fulfill their responsibilities."

Kazami finally said: The Japanese people's struggle for independence and peace is difficult. But, I believe that as long as we wage tireless struggles against difficulties, the day of victory over the imperialist forces will surely come.

    日本人民决心废除日美条约
    日本军国主义者得到美帝国主义者的支持  帝国主义只有在遭受严重打击时才会让步
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：出席第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的日本代表团团长风见章2日下午在大会预备会议上就日本人民争取独立与和平的斗争作了详细的报告。
    风见章首先对各国人民给予日本人民斗争的热烈支持表示感谢。他并且说：“我怀着非常愉快的心情告诉你们，这种支持已经大大鼓舞了日本人民的斗争。”
    他说：“我们现在面临的最大的问题之一是日美‘安全条约’问题。这个问题广泛地引起了日本人民的注意，因为它同他们目前和将来的生活密切有关。”
    他说：“首先，这项修改了的条约将必然会再次使日本参加另一次战争。新条约要求日本在美国的远东战略方面同美国合作。条约中的远东地区甚至暗示着包括中华人民共和国和苏联的领土。当然，条约把日本核军备的发展认为是当然之事。”
    风见章说，“前首相岸信介一再说，这项条约是防御性的条约。但是，我愿意问他，被鼓吹的军事条约哪一个不被说成是防御性的条约？显然，目前威胁着日本安全的是美国，它在日本土地上有着军事基地。美国建立军事基地为什么不是侵略行动呢？需要对太平洋战争爆发负责的日本在1937年同德国和意大利签订了军事防御条约。当时的日本政府也曾声言，军事条约是防御条约。”
    风见章说：“第二，新条约的矛头显然针对着日本在亚洲的邻国。在第二次世界大战中，日本帝国主义者侵略了亚洲国家，对亚洲国家人民造成了难以言述的痛苦。今天，日本统治阶级在美帝国主义的支持下再次打算侵略亚洲。”
    他强调指出：“日本是亚洲的成员国。日本没有其他办法，它只能和亚洲国家合作。当日本反对民族主义和亚洲国家——包括今天正在建立新世界的社会主义国家在内——的时候，这个国家如何能有光明的前途？”
    风见章说，“第三，修改了的条约的目的是镇压争取独立、和平和民主的运动。最近，政府企图以越来越嚣张的方式来干涉并用暴力来反对劳工和和平运动。人们可以预见到，作为修改安全条约的结果一些反动的法律将被制订出来。”
    风见章说：我们日本人希望和平和我们国家的独立，我们对这项军事条约已经表示了我们的反对。一年多来一直在进行的反对“安全条约”的斗争就其广度、深度和强度来说已经发展成为日本历史上最巨大的斗争。通过这种斗争，在日本各地组织了二千多个共同斗争组织，聚集在这种组织周围的社会各阶层人民参加了二十二次统一行动。他说：日本人民决不会忘记很多英勇的示威者所流的鲜血。
    风见章强调说：“日本和美国政府声称，修改了的条约是有效的。但是希望和平和民族独立的全体日本人民认为这项条约是无效的。不仅如此，我们还决心继续斗争以废除这项条约。”
    风见章接着向全体代表报告了日本人民在这次具有历史意义的斗争中所取得的宝贵教训。他说，“这些教训之一是，我们必须分清我们的朋友和我们的敌人的界限。认清谁企图挑起战争？谁压迫和侵略其他国家？通过反对‘安全条约’的运动，我们日本人民清楚地认识到，新条约是日本军国主义者在美帝国主义者的支持下搞起来的。为了最后废除‘安全条约’并取得和平与独立，我们现在必须组织统一行动来反对这些势力。在这样做的时候，我们必须清楚地看到支持‘安全条约’的这些敌人。”
    风见章强调说：“我们不能受他们的和平幌子的迷惑，而要尽我们最大的力量孤立他们。几乎每一次斗争都表明，帝国主义者只有在他们遭受严重打击的时候才会让步。”他强调，为了维护和平，必须反对军事基地、反对驻在别国的外国军队和军事同盟条约。
    他说：“日本人民的斗争大大地受到南朝鲜、土耳其和古巴人民所进行的斗争的激励和鼓舞。日本人民迫使他们的政府取消艾森豪威尔的访问一事，已经鼓舞了亚非和拉丁美洲国家的民族解放运动，并取得了全世界爱好和平人民的支持。日本人民从没有像今天这样充分意识到国际团结的力量，他们对能够履行他们的责任感到高兴。”
    风见章最后说：日本人民争取独立和和平的斗争是有困难的。但是，我相信，只要我们对困难进行不倦的斗争，对帝国主义势力取得胜利的日子一定会来到。
