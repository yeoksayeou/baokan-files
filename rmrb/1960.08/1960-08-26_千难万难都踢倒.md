Kick Down All Difficulties
    Sun Dade
    In Yantai City, Shandong Province, there's a widely circulated story about eight women running a factory. These eight housewives, with no industrial skills, inspired by the General Line of Socialist Construction, and driven by revolutionary fervor, dismantled their cooking stoves to build a furnace and traded their brooms for forging hammers to start a small nail factory. Initially, they could only produce two *jin* of iron nails per day. However, these eight heroines, resilient and determined, advanced despite difficulties. Lacking raw materials, they searched for scrap; lacking technical skills, they sought advice; lacking tools, they made their own, kicking down all difficulties. Now, the original small nail factory has grown from eight to seventy-five people, and the products have increased from one to over twenty. The nail pointing machine and nail heading machine they created are now being ordered by many large factories.
    The story of the eight women running the factory offers us multiple insights. One of them is that to radiate more light and heat in socialist construction, we must first have ambitious goals and aspirations to strive for strength. With such ambition, we will be unwilling to lag behind, unafraid of difficulties, striving for progress, and climbing to new heights. Even if the Yangtze River stretches for thousands of miles, we must go against the current, refusing to stop until we reach the upper reaches. Even if the mountains are ten thousand *ren* high, we must climb step by step, refusing to stop until we reach the summit. To climb high and reach the summit, we must fully promote the revolutionary spirit of "The Red Army fears not the trials of a long march, holding light ten thousand crags and torrents," overcoming thousands of difficulties and enduring countless hardships, letting nothing stop us from moving forward. The eight heroines of Yantai were able to overcome difficulties, forge ahead, and cultivate a bright red flower on the industrial front of the motherland precisely because they established such an aspiration to strive for strength!
    The spirit of striving for strength is also extremely valuable because it opens up a broad world for fully developing people's subjective initiative. Conscious dynamism is a characteristic of humanity. Although this characteristic is common to all humans, whether it can be fully developed varies from person to person. Only revolutionary fighters who cherish the soaring aspirations of socialism and communism, who always possess the spirit of continuous revolution, constantly point out to themselves the "fruits" that can only be picked by jumping, and demand that they fully develop their conscious initiative to realize their great ideals. Therefore, they can also, like the eight heroines who started a factory empty-handed, consciously unlock the treasure trove of human wisdom and power, unleashing its infinite power for the construction of the motherland.
    Let us all be inspired by the story of the eight women running the factory, establish great ambitions to strive for strength, promote revolutionary fervor, work diligently and practically, work hard and thriftily, so that the ship of the motherland's construction can ride the wind and waves and speed forward on the broad socialist and communist course! May our country, with its nine million six hundred thousand square kilometers of land and six hundred fifty million people, make greater contributions to humanity in all aspects.

    千难万难都踢倒
    孙大德
    在山东省烟台市，传颂着一个八女办厂的故事：八位手无寸铁的家庭妇女，在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，凭着一股子革命干劲，拆了锅台盘红炉，丢下炊帚挥鎯头，办起了一个小小的制钉厂。开始只能日产二斤铁钉，可是，八位女英雄坚韧不拔，知难而进，没有原料找废料，没有技术多请教，没有工具自己造，千难万难都踢倒。现在，原来的小小制钉厂已由八人增加到七十五人，产品也由一种增加到二十多种。她们创制的铁钉掐尖机和铁钉压顶机，许多大工厂也纷纷前来订货。
    八女办厂的故事，对我们有多方面的启示，其中之一，就是要使自己在社会主义建设中发射更多的光和热，首先要有发愤图强的大志雄心。有了这种大志雄心，就会不甘落后，不畏艰难，力争上游，力攀高峰。任凭长江万里，一定逆流而上，不居上游不罢休；任凭山高万仞，一定步步登高，不登顶峰不干休。为了登高攀上，充分发扬“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲”的革命气概，遇千难破千难，遇万苦渡万苦，千难万苦也阻挡不住我们前进的脚步。烟台的八位女英雄正是因为树立了这样的发愤图强之志，才能克服困难，勇往直前，在祖国的工业战线上栽培出一朵鲜艳的红花！
    发愤图强的精神所以极为可贵，还因为它给充分发挥人的主观能动作用开辟了广阔的天地。自觉的能动性是人类的特点。这种特点虽属人类共有，但能否充分发挥，却又因人而异。只有胸怀社会主义、共产主义的凌云壮志的革命战士，永远具有不断革命的精神，经常向自己指出跳一跳才能摘下来的“果子”，要求自己为实现伟大理想而充分发挥自觉的能动性。因此，他们也就能够如同八位白手办厂的女英雄那样，自觉地开启人的智慧和力量的宝库，使它们为祖国建设迸发出无穷的威力。
    让我们都从八女办厂的故事中受到启示，大立图强之志，大鼓革命干劲，踏踏实实，埋头苦干，克勤克俭，使祖国建设的航船，在宽阔的社会主义、共产主义的航道上，乘风破浪，飞驰前进！愿我们这样一个具有九百六十万平方公里土地和六亿五千万人口的国家，在各个方面都对人类有较大的贡献。
