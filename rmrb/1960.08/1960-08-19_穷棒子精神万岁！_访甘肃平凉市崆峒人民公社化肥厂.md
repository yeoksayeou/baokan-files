    Long Live the Poor Stick Spirit!
    ——Visiting the Kongtong People's Commune Fertilizer Plant in Pingliang City, Gansu
    By Our Reporter, Dong Zhiyuan

    We arrived at the office of the Kongtong Commune Fertilizer Plant. It was a simple, clean, and strange building: newly built tile-roofed houses, snow-white walls, but no ceiling; the walls were covered with certificates and flags awarded by the National Conference of Heroes, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Special Zone, the City, and the Commune; the desks were broken incense tables discarded from temples; on the table were displayed many kinds of chemical products produced by the factory that met national standards, while the technician held an old Chinese medicine scale… All of this seemed very uncoordinated on the surface. In fact, this is a concrete image of the spirit of hard work, self-reliance, and the "poor stick" spirit of all 98 employees of the factory.

    “Where there are people, there are solutions”

    The Kongtong Commune Fertilizer Plant was born on January 15, 1959. On this day, the commune's Party committee called Ma Youcang, a Communist Party member and director of the credit cooperative of the Tuba Production Team, to the commune. They first explained the situation of the commune: some of the river valley land had abundant fertilizer and water, and the yield per mu could reach more than 300 jin; the remote mountainous areas lacked water and fertilizer, and the yield per mu was only 80 jin. To help the mountainous areas develop production, it was necessary to start with fertilizer. Manure fertilizer was difficult to transport because of the high mountains and steep roads; there was not enough chemical fertilizer on the market to buy. Then they said, "We are asking you to take charge of the fertilizer accumulation team and have you set up a fertilizer plant for our commune." Ma Youcang was illiterate and had never seen how fertilizer was produced. However, when he thought of the path he had taken during the Great Leap Forward in steel production, he bravely accepted the task.

    Back at the fertilizer accumulation team, Ma Youcang found three Party members to convey the decision of the Party committee. Yang Zuokuan praised it as soon as he heard it: "This is a good idea!" But Old Yang, the cadre sent by the city, said, "With nothing to start with, can a factory grow out of the riverbed?" Ma Youcang said, "You can't say that. Where there are people, there are solutions. If you have hands, you are not afraid of not being able to use them!" Yang Zuokuan also said, "Wang Guofan promoted the poor stick spirit and ran the cooperative well. Are we, more than a hundred people, afraid of not being able to run a fertilizer plant? As long as our Party members are of one mind and the cadres take the lead, people can do anything!" Old Yang listened to the two and slowly gained courage. That night, the factory construction plan met with the masses. Some people said, "Can we build a factory with these three halls and two clay gods?" Some said, "If there are no houses, we will build them; if we lack money, we will engage in sideline occupations; if we don't know how to do it, we will learn. No one is born a saint." After half a night of debate, the poor stick spirit still prevailed.

    The next day, Ma Youcang brought his tables, benches, iron pots, and water tanks from home. Many commune members volunteered to lend their surplus furniture when they heard that fertilizer was going to be produced. After counting, there were 70 carrying poles, 50 shovels, three square tables, three water tanks, and a door panel.

    Yang Zuokuan led dozens of people into the city to work as temporary workers, breaking ice, carrying water, making coal bricks, and repairing toilets to raise funds; Ma Youcang led some people to dig foundations and build houses; a few literate people followed Yang Zizhi to bookstores, newspapers, and searched for information. At the same time, they wrote letters to more than 20 chemical plants in Northeast China, Qingdao, and other places for technical information, and sent two people to the Pingliang City Fertilizer Plant to study.

    We must produce fertilizer

    The atmosphere in front of Chongfo Temple was completely new. People used more than 900 yuan earned as temporary workers to buy materials and built seven bungalows as bacterial fertilizer workshops; they leveled a site on the hillside and set up several large pots as fertilizer workshops; they boiled saltpeter and made ammonia water in the three halls of Chongfo Temple, which was regarded as a chemical workshop. Hands of warm assistance extended from all directions. Chemical plants in Qingdao, Dalian, and other places sent information on the manufacture of various fertilizers, and the Pingliang City Fertilizer Plant helped train two technicians.

    On the hillside, the furnaces were blazing, and people were working day and night to trial-produce ammonium nitrate fertilizer. After seven failures, they finally succeeded. The workers took the first product they produced and compared it with the samples given by the large factory: theirs was snow-white, while theirs was gray. Some people wavered again: "Boiling urine in a pot, can that be considered fertilizer!" "Look at the bacterial fertilizer produced by the city fertilizer plant, the grains are grains, and the powder is powder. What is this thing we made?" People overcame the severe cold and poverty through arduous struggle, but they did not believe that they could master science and technology.

    Cold winds blew into the heart of Secretary Ma Youcang. He recalled the story of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved Mountains told by Chairman Mao. He thought: If we have to move a big mountain, can't we overcome a small technical barrier? Thinking of this, he gathered the activists from several workshops to discuss boosting morale and resisting the cold winds, and decided on two things: First, the produced ammonium nitrate must be sent for testing immediately, and if it does not meet the standards, it must continue to be trial-produced. We must produce fertilizer that meets the standards; second, the bacterial fertilizer workshop must start immediately to produce bacterial fertilizer that meets the standards.

    To produce bacterial fertilizer, a simple set of production equipment would cost a lot of money. What to do? The poor have poor solutions. If we lack equipment, we must still do it. Without money to buy a high-pressure sterilizer, we use an old steamer instead; without ultraviolet lamps, we use alcohol lamps to sterilize; we build a fire wall in the house to replace the refrigerator for insulation; without Kjeldahl flasks, everyone uses vinegar bottles and soy sauce bottles from home...

    After many experiments, bacterial fertilizer was finally produced. Old Man Dong Shiping took a handful of bacterial fertilizer and buried it under the roots of the tomatoes. A few days later, he excitedly told everyone he met, "This fertilizer doesn't smell like anything, but it really works. The seedlings in the ground change every day, as if someone is blowing them up with a tube!" The achievement strengthened people's confidence, and people continued to move forward on the road to overcome difficulties.

    “Want the horse to run, yet want the horse not to eat grass”

    Ma Youcang and the workers carried urine buckets to collect human urine to boil ammonium nitrate. Once, they ran into people from the production team who were collecting urine for fertilizer accumulation. This made Ma Youcang think of a new problem: Human urine and plant ash were originally good fertilizers, so why boil them? At the same time, how could the fertilizer plant compete with the team for fertilizer resources? Besides, it took a lot of manpower to get these things, and the cost was too expensive. This approach was problematic. He discussed what he thought with the workers: "Think about it, can we find a way to 'want the horse to run, yet want the horse not to eat grass'?"

    Everyone found a new way out: mobilize the masses to find various minerals to expand fertilizer production channels. One snowy evening, Ma Youcang went up the mountain against the blizzard. In the old Shitou Gully where he encountered "ghost fire" while herding sheep in his childhood, he found phosphate rock, and worker Zheng Jinrong also found a large amount of peat.

    Commune members also sent strange stones and clods of earth to support their fertilizer plant. Old Man Liu Lianman sent an important raw material for fertilizer—acidic calcareous soil. According to the clues reported by commune member Li Siyi, more than 20,000 jin of animal bones were dug up... The raw materials were inexhaustible. However, they would never easily waste them just because there were many raw materials and they did not cost money. Any material that entered the factory became a treasure. They used the swept saltpeter soil to boil gunpowder first, then made ammonium nitrate, then extracted hydrochloric acid from the saltpeter, and then used the remaining saltpeter mud to make carbon-potassium mixed fertilizer and granular fertilizer. Finally, the remaining mud residue was piled up and transformed into artificial saltpeter soil after cultivation.

    The poor stick spirit has opened up a broad road, and the fertilizer plant is advancing rapidly on this road. In the past year or so, its products have increased from a dozen to more than a hundred, and the chemical products produced are very popular in Pingliang City. Now, it has armed itself into a small chemical integrated enterprise with seven workshops. In the first half of this year, it supplied more than 1,900 tons of chemical fertilizer, bacterial fertilizer, and pesticides to the commune's 100,000 mu of cultivated land according to the land, time, and crops, supporting agricultural production. The factory's output has increased several times, but the number of workers has decreased by 13%, and the quality of eleven kinds of chemical fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers has reached national standards.

    Long Live the Poor Stick Spirit!
    The spirit of hard work and self-improvement of the Kongtong Commune Fertilizer Plant quickly spread, and honor belongs to the people who work hard to build socialism. Branch Secretary Ma Youcang represented all the employees to attend the National Conference of Heroes, becoming a red flag for producing fertilizer using indigenous methods starting from scratch nationwide.

    Recently, we came to visit this nationally famous fertilizer plant. The employees told us a story about buying a table:

    It turned out that they heard that the province was going to hold an on-site meeting here recently. Some people thought that now that the factory was famous and had a solid foundation, it should be cleaned up and look like something, but the laboratory table used was still made of two broken boards. At first, Ma Youcang felt that the chemical production in the first half of the year had a surplus of more than 10,000 yuan, and it would not matter if he spent dozens of yuan to buy a laboratory table. He ran to several places, but they all thought the table was too expensive, and he couldn't make up his mind to buy it. The salesman said, "Secretary Ma, your factory is so big, do you still care about this little money?" Unexpectedly, a word reminded him of the scene when the factory was built: everyone worked part-time, built houses, and their hands and feet were so frozen that they cracked in those freezing days, and they earned such a family business today with a drop of blood and a drop of sweat. How can we spend money casually for the sake of pomp? Thinking of this, he turned around and left.

    穷棒子精神万岁！
    ——访甘肃平凉市崆峒人民公社化肥厂
    本报记者　董志远
    我们来到了崆峒公社化肥厂的办公室。这是一座简朴、整洁而又奇怪的房子：新修的瓦房、雪白的墙，却没有天花板；墙上挂满了全国群英会、中央化工部、专区、市、公社颁发的奖状、奖旗，办公桌却是庙里不用的破香案；桌上陈列着许多种本厂出品的达到国家标准的化工产品，化验员手里拿的却是国药店的旧戥子；……这一切，表面看来好像很不协调。其实，这正是全厂九十八名职工发奋图强、自力更生的穷棒子精神的具体形象。
    “有人就有办法”
    崆峒公社化肥厂诞生在1959年1月15日。这天，公社党委把共产党员、土坝生产队的信用部主任马有仓叫到了社里，先给他摆了一下全社的情况：社里的一部分川地，肥多水足，亩产可达三百多斤；边远的山地缺水少肥，亩产只有八十斤。帮助山区发展生产，必须从肥料上下手。搞粪肥，山高路陡送不上去；买化肥，市场上没有那么多。然后说：“找你来，就是想把积肥专业队交给你，叫你给咱们公社办个化肥厂。”马有仓一字不识，从来没见过怎样生产化肥。但是，他一想到大炼钢铁中走过来的道路，就勇敢地接受了任务。
    回到积肥专业队，马有仓把三个党员找到一起传达党委的决定。杨佐宽一听就赞称：“这是个好主意！”但市里派来的干部老杨却说：“两手空空，河滩里还能长出工厂来？”马有仓说：“话可不能这样说，有人就有办法，长着手就不怕膀子甩不开！”杨佐宽也说：“王国藩发扬穷棒子精神办好了合作社，咱们一百多人还怕办不起个化肥厂吗？只要咱们党员一条心，干部领头干，翻天复地都是人干的！”老杨听两人说的有理，慢慢也有了勇气。当天晚上，建厂计划就和群众见了面。有人说：“就凭这三间大殿，两尊泥神，能办个工厂吗？”有的说：“没房子动手盖，缺钱搞副业，不会做出去学，谁也不是一落地就是圣人。”辩论了半夜，还是穷棒子精神占了上风。
    第二天，马有仓把家里的桌子、凳子、铁锅、水缸都拉来了。许多社员听说要生产化肥，也自愿把多余的家具借出来。数了数，共有七十副挑担、五十张铁锨、三张方桌、三个水缸、一副门板。
    杨佐宽领着几十个人进城当临时工，给人家破冰打水、做煤砖、修厕所，筹集资金；马有仓领着些人挖地基、修房子；几个识字的人，跟着杨自治跑书店、翻报纸、找资料，同时给东北、青岛等地的二十几个化工厂写信要技术资料，还派了两个人到平凉市化肥厂学习。
    一定要生产出化肥
    崇佛寺前气象一新。人们用当临时工挣来的九百多元买材料修了七间平房，作为菌肥车间；在山坡上平了一块场地，支起了几口大锅，作化肥车间；在崇佛寺的三间大殿里，熬火硝、作氨水，算是化工车间。热情援助的手，从四面八方伸来，青岛、大连等地的化工厂寄来了制造各种化肥的资料，平凉市化肥厂帮助培养了两名技工。
    山坡上，炉火熊熊，人们夜以继日地在试制硝酸铵化肥，经过七次失败终于成功了。工人拿着自己生产的第一种产品和大厂给的样品比来比去：人家的雪白，自己的却是灰的。有的人又动摇了：“锅里熬尿，还能算个化肥！”“看人家市化肥厂出的细菌肥料，颗是颗，面是面，咱们弄的这算个啥？”人们经过艰苦奋斗战胜了严寒、贫穷，却不相信自己能够掌握科学技术。
    冷风一股一股地吹进支书马有仓的心里。他回忆起毛主席说的愚公移山的故事，他想：是座大山都要推倒它，小小的技术关还攻不下吗？想到这，他把几个车间的积极分子找到一块商量，要鼓干劲、顶冷风，并决定了两件事情：一、把生产的硝酸铵马上请人化验，达不到标准就继续试制，一定要生产出合乎标准的化肥；二、菌肥车间立刻上马，要生产出合乎标准的细菌肥。
    要生产细菌肥料，一套简单的生产设备就得很多钱，怎么办？穷有穷办法，缺少设备也要干。没钱买高压灭菌锅，用旧蒸笼代替；没有紫外线灯，用酒精灯杀菌；在房子里砌起一堵火墙，代替电冰箱保温；没有克氏瓶，大家把家里的醋瓶、酱油瓶拿来用……。
    经过多次试验，终于制成细菌肥料。董世平老汉捧了一捧菌肥埋在西红柿的根下，几天以后，他兴奋得逢人就说：“这肥料，闻去没个味，用着真顶事，上在地里苗苗一天一个样，像人拿筒筒子吹的！”成就坚定了人们的信心，人们脚踏着困难继续前进。
    “既要马儿跑，又要马儿不吃草”
    马有仓和工人挑上尿桶收人尿熬硝酸铵。有一次，他们和生产队收尿积肥的人走碰了头。这使马有仓想起了一个新问题：人尿、草木灰原来就是好肥料，何必要熬呢？同时，化肥厂又怎能和队里抢肥源？再说，弄这些东西花工又多，成本又贵，这种做法有问题。他把想到的事情和工人商量：“想想看，能不能找出个又要马儿跑，又要马儿不吃草的办法来？”
    众人找出了一条新的出路：发动群众寻找各种矿石，扩大化肥生产门路。一个飘雪的黄昏，马有仓顶着扑面的大雪上山了，在他童年时代放羊遇到“鬼火”的老石沟里找到了磷矿石，工人郑金荣也找到大量泥炭。
    社员们也纷纷把奇奇怪怪的石头、土块送来，支援自己的化肥厂。刘连满老汉送来了化肥的重要原料——酸性钙质土。根据社员李思义报告的线索，挖出了两万多斤兽骨。……原料取之不尽，用之不竭。但是，他们绝不因为原料多、不花钱而轻易浪费。任何材料一进厂门就都变成了宝贝。他们用扫来的硝土先熬火药，再做硝酸铵，然后从硝盐里提制盐酸，又用剩下的硝泥做碳钾混合肥和颗粒肥料，最后剩的泥渣又堆了起来，经过培养重新变成了人造硝土。
    穷棒子精神辟开了一条广阔的大道，化肥厂在这条大路上一日千里地前进。一年多来，它的产品由十几种增加到一百多种，出产的化工产品在平凉市很受欢迎。现在，它已把自己武装成了一个拥有七个车间的小型化工综合企业。今年上半年，给全社十万亩耕地因地、因时、因作物供应了一千九百多吨化肥、菌肥和农药，支援了农业生产。工厂的产量增加了好几倍，工人反而减少了13％，十一种化肥、菌肥的质量已经达到国家标准。
    穷棒子精神万岁！
    崆峒公社化肥厂发奋图强的穷棒子精神很快地传扬了出去，荣誉属于艰苦奋斗建设社会主义的人们。支部书记马有仓代表全体职工出席了全国群英会，成为全国白手起家用土法生产化肥的一面红旗。
    最近，我们来访问这个闻名全国的化肥厂。职工们曾向我们谈了一个买桌子的故事：
    原来，听说省里最近要在这里开一个现场会议。有的人认为现在工厂出了名，底子也厚了，应该收拾得漂漂亮亮像个样子，可是用的化验桌还是两块破板子凑的。开头，马有仓觉得上半年光化工生产就盈余了一万多元，花几十元买个化验桌子也算不了啥。他跑了几个地方，都嫌桌子太贵，要买又拿不定主意。售货员说：“马支书，你们都是那么大的工厂了，还在乎这几个钱吗？”不料一句话却使他猛然记起了建厂时的情景：大家在那滴水成冰的日子里，打短工、盖房子，脚手都冻得裂了口子，才一滴血一滴汗挣来今天这样一个家业。现在怎能为了排场随便花钱呢？想到这，扭头就走了。
