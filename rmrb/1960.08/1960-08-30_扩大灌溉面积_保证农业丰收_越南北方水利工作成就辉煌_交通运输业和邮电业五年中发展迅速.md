    Expanding Irrigated Area to Ensure a Bumper Harvest
    Brilliant Achievements in Water Conservancy in Northern Vietnam
    Rapid Development of Transportation and Post and Telecommunications in Five Years
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 27th: The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has achieved brilliant results in water conservancy work in the fifteen years since its founding. Now, from the mountains to the plains, many provinces and regions have established intricate water conservancy networks, playing a significant role in flood control, waterlogging prevention, drought resistance, and ensuring agricultural harvests.
    In recent years, under the leadership of the Vietnam Labor Party and the government, the Vietnamese people have vigorously engaged in water conservancy construction. According to statistics from relevant departments, by the end of 1959, the irrigated area of water conservancy projects in northern Vietnam had reached 1,900,700 hectares.
    During the eighty years of criminal rule by French imperialism in Vietnam, northern Vietnam suffered from floods on average every two years. Each flood destroyed hundreds of villages and displaced tens of thousands of people. During the war of resistance, French imperialism, in order to economically strangle the liberated areas, carried out reckless bombing of existing water conservancy projects, causing serious damage to dikes and leaving large areas of farmland barren.
    After the ceasefire in Vietnam, the people of northern Vietnam used their hard work to quickly restore the damaged water conservancy projects.
    In 1958, at the beginning of Vietnam's Three-Year Plan, the Vietnam Labor Party and the government proposed the water conservancy construction policy of "emphasizing water storage, emphasizing small-scale projects, and emphasizing community-run projects." Under the guidance of this policy, a vigorous mass movement for water conservancy construction was launched. From 1959 to the beginning of this year, the people of northern Vietnam built more than 200,000 small-scale water conservancy projects. In 1959, the amount of earthwork for various water conservancy projects (mainly small-scale projects) was 84.85 million cubic meters. Compared with the approximately 1 million cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects built annually during French rule, last year's figure increased by dozens of times. According to statistics, the area irrigated by small-scale water conservancy projects increased from more than 500,000 hectares in 1955 to more than 1 million hectares in 1959.
    At the same time, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has built a series of large-scale water conservancy projects, including the largest North Hung Hai water conservancy project and the Yi'an South water conservancy project. The North Hung Hai water conservancy project, which is currently under construction, can irrigate more than 114,000 hectares of cultivated land. The Yi'an South water conservancy project was completed at the beginning of this year, and it can irrigate more than 19,000 hectares of cultivated land, thereby increasing rice production by 4,400 tons in the irrigated area.
    Over the past six years, with the development of water conservancy, the fish farming industry, animal husbandry, and water transport have also been greatly developed, significantly changing rural life.
    Xinhua News Agency: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the transportation and post and telecommunications industries of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have developed rapidly since the restoration of peace in 1954.
    By the end of last year, the total length of railways in northern Vietnam had been more than six times that at the end of 1954 when the French troops withdrew. During this period, in addition to repairing more than 600 kilometers of war-damaged railways, the Vietnamese government also built a new 56-kilometer-long railway from Dong Anh to Taiyuan, the future steel center. This railway is scheduled to open to traffic on the 15th anniversary of the founding of Vietnam (September 2).
    In the past five years, the Vietnamese government has also repaired or improved more than 2,600 kilometers of highways and more than 9,000 meters of bridges that were severely damaged by the war. The total length of highways has increased by 38% compared with the pre-war period.
    In the mountainous areas of northern Vietnam, where there were almost no roads in the past, 686 kilometers of highways have now been built to promote the exchange of materials and serve the people of various ethnic minorities. At the same time, all major ports have been expanded to serve export trade. These ports include Haiphong Port, Hong Gai Port for coal export, Cam Pha Port, Ong Mon Port, and Ben Thuy Port in central northern Vietnam.
    By the end of 1959, the volume of railway transport in northern Vietnam had increased elevenfold, highway transport had increased 1.4 times, and coastal and inland waterway transport had increased 1.5 times.
    While encouraging the development of the people's transportation potential, the Vietnamese government has paid special attention to expanding state-owned transportation. By the end of last year, state-owned transportation accounted for 70.3% of the total freight volume.
    In the past five years, Vietnam's postal and telecommunications services have also developed greatly. The workload of postal and telecommunications services, calculated in cash, has increased 4.4 times. During the French rule, there were only long-distance telephones between Hanoi and provincial capitals, as well as some county towns. Now, long-distance telephones have been expanded to all counties, including the most remote county towns in the mountains.
    Today, the length of telephone lines in northern Vietnam is equivalent to 88% of the telephone lines in the entire Indochina in 1945. In addition, northern Vietnam has established telephone links with Beijing, Moscow, and other socialist countries' capitals.

    扩大灌溉面积　保证农业丰收
    越南北方水利工作成就辉煌
    交通运输业和邮电业五年中发展迅速
    新华社河内27日电　越南民主共和国成立十五年来在水利工作方面取得了辉煌的成就。现在从山区到平原，很多省、区已经建立了纵横交错的水利网，对防洪、防涝、抗旱和保证农业的丰收起了巨大的作用。
    几年来，越南人民在越南劳动党和政府的领导下大力兴修水利。据有关部门统计，截至1959年年底，越南北方水利工程灌溉面积已经达到一百九十万零七千公顷。
    在法帝国主义罪恶统治越南的八十年间，越南北方平均每两年就要发生一次水灾。每次水灾都有成百个村庄被洪水冲毁，成千成万的人流离失所。在抗战期间，法帝国主义为了从经济上扼杀解放区，对已有的水利工程进行了狂轰滥炸，使堤坝受到严重破坏，大片农田荒芜。
    越南停战以后，越南北方人民用辛勤的劳动迅速恢复了被破坏的水利工程。
    1958年，在越南三年计划开始的时候，越南劳动党和政府提出了“蓄水为主、小型为主、民办为主”的水利建设方针。在这个方针的指导下，全民掀起了轰轰烈烈的兴修水利运动。从1959年到今年年初，越南北方人民就修建了二十多万个小型水利工程。1959年修筑各种水利工程（主要是小型工程）的土方为八千四百八十五万，同法国统治时期每年修筑水利工程约一百万土方比较，去年就增加了几十倍。据统计，1959年小型水利灌溉的面积已从1955年的五十多万公顷增加到一百多万公顷。
    越南民主共和国政府同时兴建了一系列大型水利工程，其中包括最大的北兴海水利工程、宜安南部水利工程等。目前正在建设中的北兴海水利工程可以使十一万四千多公顷的耕地得到灌溉。宜安南部水利工程已经在今年年初建成，它可以灌溉一万九千多公顷耕地，由此使受灌溉地区增产稻谷四千四百吨。
    六年来，随着水利事业的发展，养鱼业、饲养业和水上运输也得到了很大的发展，使农村生活日益显著地发生变化。
    新华社讯　据越南通讯社报道，越南民主共和国的交通运输业和邮电业自1954年和平恢复以来有了迅速的发展。
    到去年年底，越南北方铁路全长已经等于1954年底法军撤退时的六倍多。越南政府在这期间除了已经修复六百多公里遭受战争破坏的铁路线以外，还从东英到未来的钢铁中心太原新建了五十六公里长的铁路。这条铁路预定在越南建国十五周年（9月2日）时举行通车典礼。
    在这五年中，越南政府还修复或改善了遭受战争严重破坏的公路两千六百多公里，桥梁九千多米。公路全长比战前增加了38％。
    在过去几乎根本没有道路的越南北方山区，现在也建筑了六百八十六公里的公路，来促进物资交流，为各少数民族人民服务。同时，还扩建了所有的大港口，为出口贸易服务。这些港口包括海防港，出煤的鸿基港，锦普港、翁门港和越南北方中部的边水港。
    到1959年年底，越南北方的铁路运输量增加了十一倍，公路运输量增加了一点四倍，沿海和内河水路运输量增加一点五倍。
    越南政府在鼓励发挥人民运输潜力的同时，特别注意扩大国营运输业。在去年年底，国营运输业已占全部运货量的70.3％。
    在过去五年中，越南邮电业务也有很大发展。邮电业务的工作量，以现金计算，增加了四点四倍。在法国人统治时期，只在河内和省城以及一些县城之间有长途电话，现在长途电话已扩大到各个县，包括山区最边远的县城。
    今天，越南北方电话线的长度已相当于1945年整个印度支那电话线的88％。此外，越南北方同北京、莫斯科以及其他社会主义国家首都建立了电话联系。
