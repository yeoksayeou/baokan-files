Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 27th: Shandong Province, one of the major wheat-producing areas in the country, is vigorously preparing for autumn planting in the spirit of "early preparation ensures early success."

The main experiences of Shandong Province in achieving wheat丰产 this year include: timely, suitable, and adequate deep plowing and deep turning; timely sowing; rational close planting; pre-sowing irrigation; and applying sufficient base fertilizer. Specific measures focus on grasping the following six points: (1) Timely early sowing is an important measure to ensure increased wheat production. This year, it is required that early-crop wheat be sown before the Autumn Equinox; mid-crop wheat be sown before the Cold Dew; and the remaining few late-crop wheat must also be sown before the Frost's Descent. (2) Seize the current rainy season and use all reservoirs, ponds, and pits to store large amounts of water to ensure sufficient water for sowing. (3) After the autumn harvest begins, deep plowing should be carried out according to local conditions to improve the soil and deepen the cultivated layer. (4) Resolutely eliminate sowing on bare land. Currently, various localities are vigorously accumulating pen manure, miscellaneous soil fertilizer, composting humic fertilizer, accumulating human waste, and collecting marine fertilizer. (5) The whole province is generally taking measures to prepare good seeds. (6) All parts of the province have formulated measures to eliminate spot planting, hill planting, and change the use of wide-row double-legged drills. According to statistics as of August 10, the province has manufactured and repaired 31,603 various close-planting drills and row planters. In order to improve efficiency and ensure the quality of sowing, various localities are vigorously running drill operator training classes, which will train 200,000 people before the end of August.

Xinhua News Agency: The Yuetan Brigade of Zhaizhen Commune in Yanshi County, Henan Province, established a wheat production increase guidance department under the leadership of the Party branch in early August and began preparations for autumn wheat sowing.

The Yuetan Brigade is a well-known wheat-producing team in Yanshi County, with rich experience in wheat planting. This time, they mobilized the masses to study whether high-yield fields can further increase production and the main reasons for low-yield fields, and to find the law of wheat production increase. The entire team was divided into twenty-one groups to conduct a relatively sufficient study and discussion on the harvest situation of different types of wheat fields, such as this year's high-yield plots, general fields, clay soils, and sandy soils, and summarized three main experiences: one is people's production increase thinking, one is the growth and development law of wheat itself, and one is different natural conditions. They found that some general fields and low-yield fields do not have bad soil conditions. Due to the lack of production increase thinking and careless planting, some achievable measures were not implemented, and late planting and incomplete seedlings were the main reasons for low yields. They found that timely early sowing and good sowing to ensure full seedlings is the key to ensuring the healthy development of wheat. In order to plant early and prevent wheat from growing too vigorously during overwintering before returning to green, they also studied the appropriate sowing period for various wheat fields based on the climate characteristics of Yanshi. They decided that high mountains should be planted at the Autumn Equinox, plains should be planted at the Cold Dew, and river滩 land should be planted by the Frost's Descent. Sandy and alkaline land should be planted early to facilitate complete emergence. High-yield fields should be controlled so that the wheat seedlings emerge at the Frost's Descent. It should not be planted too early to avoid winter vigor.

According to this year's best high-yield fields, there are still missing seedlings, and fertilization is prone to improper fertilization: too much nitrogen fertilizer and too little phosphorus and potassium fertilizer cause lodging. For this reason, they affirmed that the management of high-yield fields still needs to be further improved to make it more scientific and perfect.

Based on the summary, the Yuetan Brigade has launched seven aspects of autumn planting preparations in early August: First, in order to further prepare ideologically, the Yuetan Brigade Wheat Production Increase Headquarters has held a 10,000-person mobilization meeting, calling for preparing to plant wheat and striving to obtain more summer grain next year; calling on the entire team to water and cultivate autumn-ripe crops to promote early harvest and ensure timely wheat sowing. Each production team also conducted a check of labor, tools, and fertilizers. Second, planning and preparing arable land for wheat planting. In order to make the wheat growth in the high-yield plots consistent, the Yuetan Brigade also inspected the land currently planted with millet, corn, sweet potatoes, etc., which are preparing for wheat planting, and measured the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium elements in each plot, and then determined what fertilizer to apply. Third, prepare fertilizers according to fertilization requirements. Fourth, check and sun-dry wheat seeds. Fifth, rush to make wheat planting tools in advance as needed. Sixth, actively prepare for all wheat land to be mechanically cultivated this year, so as to free up labor to ensure good and meticulous planting. Seventh, train wheat technicians. Now, technical research groups have been established in each production team of the Yuetan Brigade, and they are further studying the scientific and technological aspects of cultivating wheat based on the booklet of wheat production increase experience issued by the brigade.

    山东大力准备种麦工作
    河南偃师岳滩大队总结小麦丰产经验指导秋种
    本报济南27日电　全国主要产麦区之一的山东省，根据一早百早的精神，大力进行秋种准备工作。
    山东今年获得小麦丰产地区的主要经验有：适时、适地、适量地进行深耕深翻；适时播种；合理密植；播前浇水，施足底肥。具体措施在于抓以下六点：（一）适时早种是保证小麦增产的重要措施。今年要求早茬麦在秋分前播完；中茬麦在寒露前播完，剩下的少数晚茬麦也要在霜降前播完。（二）抓紧当前雨季，利用一切水库、塘坝、坑湾，大量蓄水，以保证充足的播种用水。（三）秋收开始，即因地制宜地进行深翻，改良土壤，加深耕作层。（四）坚决消灭白茬下种。目前，各地正大积栏圈肥、土杂肥，大造土化肥，大沤草绿肥，大攒人粪尿，大捞海腥肥。（五）全省正普遍采取措施准备良种。（六）全省各地都制订了消灭点种、墩播和改变使用宽行两腿耧的措施。据8月10日统计：全省已制造、修理各种密植耧、条播机三万一千六百零三部。为了提高效率，保证播种质量，各地正在大力开办扶耧手训练班，8月底以前即可训练二十万人。
    据新华社讯　河南省偃师县翟镇公社岳滩大队已于8月上旬在党支部领导下，成立了一个小麦增产指导部，开始了秋季种麦的准备工作。
    岳滩大队是偃师县著名的小麦丰产队，种麦有丰富的经验。这次他们发动群众研究丰产田能不能再增产和低产田低产的主要原因，寻找小麦增产的规律。全队分二十一个小组，对今年的丰产方、一般田、粘土、沙土等不同类型麦田的收获情况作了较充分的研究和讨论，总结了三条主要经验：一条是人的增产思想，一条是小麦本身的生长发育规律，一条是不同的自然条件。他们发现有些一般田、低产田土质条件并不坏，由于缺乏增产思想，种得马虎，一些可以办到的措施也没有办到，种得迟，苗不全是产量不高的主要原因。他们发现适时提早播种和种好，保证全苗，是保证小麦健全发育的关键。既要早种，又要防止小麦返青前在越冬期间生长过旺，为此他们又根据偃师的气候特点，研究了各种不同麦田的适宜播种期。他们决定：秋分应种高山，寒露应种平川，霜降应种完河滩地。沙土地和碱地要种早，容易出全苗，丰产田掌握在霜降麦苗出土就可以了，不宜种得过早，以免冬旺。
    根据今年收得最好的丰产田也还有缺苗现象，管理上容易发生施肥不当：氮肥多、磷钾肥少造成倒伏。为此，他们肯定丰产田管理上还须进一步改进，使之更加科学，更加完善。
    根据总结，岳滩大队已于8月上旬展开了七个方面的秋种准备工作：一、为进一步作好思想准备，岳滩大队小麦增产指挥部已经召开了一次万人动员大会，号召准备种麦，争取明年拿到更多夏粮；号召全队为秋熟作物浇水、中耕，促使早收，保证小麦适时播种。每个生产队也进行了查劳力，查工具，查肥料等工作。二、规划和准备种麦的耕地。为了使丰产方的小麦生长一致，岳滩大队还对现在种着谷子、玉米、红薯等准备种麦的地进行检查，测定了每块地含氮、磷、钾三要素的含量，然后确定施用什么肥料。三、根据施肥要求准备肥料。四、检查和翻晒麦种。五、按需要提前赶制种麦工具。六、积极准备今年麦地全部机耕，以便腾出劳力保证种好种细。七、训练小麦技术人员。现在，岳滩大队各生产队都建立了技术研究小组，正在根据大队印发的小麦丰产经验小册子，进一步研究培育小麦的科学技术。
