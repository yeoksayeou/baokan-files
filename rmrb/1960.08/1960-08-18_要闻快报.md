Guangxi Stores 2.9 Billion Cubic Meters of Water During Rains

Guangxi is actively storing water during the rains to prevent drought and ensure a bumper harvest of middle and late rice crops. As of August 7, the total water storage in ponds and reservoirs throughout the autonomous region had increased from 1.7 billion cubic meters before the rains to over 2.9 billion cubic meters.

Xinjiang Uses Coal Dust to Melt Glaciers and Develop Water Sources

In July, Xinjiang's civil aviation, meteorological, and other units used aircraft high-altitude blackening and blasting methods on the Hala-budig Glacier in the Tianshan Mountains of Hami Prefecture to carry out a large-scale month-long ice and snow melting operation. This provided timely irrigation for summer and autumn crops in some communes and farms in the Hami area. The Meteorological Group of the Autonomous Region's Civil Aviation Administration, after trial flights and measurement point preparations starting in late June, flew a total of thirty times and airdropped nearly seventy tons of coal dust in nearly a month until late July. The melted water reached 1.25 million cubic meters, greatly exceeding the original expected effect of 10,000 cubic meters of water melted per ton of coal dust.
