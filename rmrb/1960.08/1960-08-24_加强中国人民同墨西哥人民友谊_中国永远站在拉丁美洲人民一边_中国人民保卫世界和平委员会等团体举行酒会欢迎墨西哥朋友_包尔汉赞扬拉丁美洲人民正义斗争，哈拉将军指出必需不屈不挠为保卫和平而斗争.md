Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the China-Latin America Friendship Association held a reception tonight in the East Hall of the Shanghai Hall of the Great Hall of the People, warmly welcoming the peace warrior General Heriberto Jara, Chairman of the Mexican National Peace Council and member of the World Peace Council, and Mr. José Rosales, editor of the Mexican magazine "Siempre!".

Liao Chengzhi and Burhan, Vice Chairmen of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and Chu Tunan, President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association, attended tonight's reception.

At the reception, Burhan, on behalf of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the China-Latin America Friendship Association, extended a warm welcome to the Latin American friends General Jara and Mr. Rosales. He said that the Mexican people have a glorious tradition of opposing imperialism and national and democratic movements. General Jara has been an outstanding peace warrior in Mexico for many years. We are honored by General Hara's visit. His visit will surely further strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Mexican people.

Burhan emphasized that the Chinese people warmly support the struggles of the Mexican people, the Cuban people, and the Latin American people, and we thank them for their support of the Chinese people. The Chinese people will always stand with the people of Latin America. The Latin American people's struggle against American aggression and for national independence has made a great contribution to defending world peace. In the current situation where the world's people's strength in anti-imperialist struggle is unprecedentedly strong and imperialism is at its end, we believe that the Latin American people, united and persistent in their struggle, will surely continue to achieve new victories.

Burhan concluded by saying that we ask General Hara and Mr. Rosales to convey the wishes of the Chinese people to the Mexican and Latin American people.

General Hara spoke amidst warm applause. The full text is as follows: Dear friends:

We sincerely thank you for the sincere reception you have given us in the name of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the China-Latin America Friendship Association. Recently, due to my poor health, I have not been able to fulfill my long-held wish to visit this great country for many years. Today, due to the kind invitation of Chinese representatives who participated in the Sixth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament held in Tokyo from the 2nd to the 9th of this month, I am honored to come to this great country, which has always been full of miracles, and today is even more full of miracles, light, and examples.

Here, in my own name and on behalf of the Mexican peace advocates and the China-Mexico Friendship Association, I extend my cordial greetings. They are rightly concerned about China's development and future, just as they care about the future of people all over the world, because we firmly believe that peace is indivisible, and that is why if some people enjoy peace while others live in insecurity, it is not just and complete peace. There are many Chinese expatriates in Mexico, and from ancient times, we have had the opportunity to admire the diligent and persistent labor of Chinese workers, and now I alone have the opportunity to see them working with enthusiasm in a new life, a new life that has opened up undeniable new horizons for them.

At several peace conferences, I have had the pleasure of getting close to Mr. Guo Moruo, the outstanding Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. When he delivered the closing speech at the recent conference in Stockholm, his words with profound moral and peaceful content deservedly won warm applause. At that time, the representatives stood up and applauded for several minutes.

The Sixth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament held recently in Tokyo was very interesting. There, one could clearly see the feelings of the Japanese people, who are against all war preparations and everything that could throw them into anti-peace actions. They do not want military treaties, nor do they want missile launch bases to be established on their territory; they warmly demand that the Ryukyu Islands be returned to Japan, and repeatedly point out that the huge military bases established there by the Americans are a threat to China, and they do not want China to be threatened.

Representatives of almost all countries participated in this conference of great significance; representatives of our various ethnic groups arrived there closely united, and we were all concerned about the same cause: lasting peace. In the working group meetings in preparation for the conference, miners, farmers, teachers, railway workers, etc. all enthusiastically expressed this desire.

One clear afternoon, we gathered in a beautiful park, where a long march of 10,000 people arrived from all parts of Japan, each representing millions of Japanese people who did not want war, bringing letters of peace. Each "marcher" held a brightly colored flag and carried a sign with peace slogans. Among them were priests, Muslims, and Buddhists, who, after making brief and devout prayers, delivered passionate speeches condemning war and praising peace.

During the conference, the wide conference hall could hardly accommodate all the delegates. This shows the Japanese people's extreme concern for peace.

The Chinese representatives' very sincere attitude at this unforgettable meeting often reminded me of the noble character of this great nation. Although they fought bloody battles with Japan not many years ago to recover lost territory, they harbored no resentment and sent their representatives. These representatives admirably completed their work, and the Chinese people deeply know that war is not the business of the people, especially in modern times, but is driven by the imperialist and militarist forces.

We have said more than once that as long as the people do not want war, war will not happen, and if the people of various countries have close ties with their governments, as is the case in China, war will be even less likely to break out. However, it is not enough to just say no to war and yearn for peace; it is also necessary to fight unswervingly to achieve this, not only to maintain peace temporarily, but to maintain peace permanently.

I once heard a Chinese friend say in a speech that it is not enough to work for peace by giving eloquent speeches and flowery, ornate words, but it is necessary to make the words match the reality, even if they are not so beautiful and moving, they must be sincere.

This opinion is very correct, because if the beautiful words in support of peace that have been uttered in the past and present were sincerely meant, these words would weigh millions of tons.

At this great gathering, people talked about universal disarmament, about the need to constantly strive to achieve this goal; about the need for the people of all countries divided by war policies to unite; about the need for the United Nations to fulfill its obligations in accordance with its duties, to give the People's Republic of China its deserved position, not to deviate from the articles of the San Francisco Charter, and at the same time to prevent the Organization of American States from becoming an appendage of the US government, but to fulfill its lofty mission.

People are becoming increasingly clear about the meaning of peace, about what affects peace, and what is beneficial to peace. It is very encouraging to see this situation.

People are becoming more and more aware that never before has it been the case that the people of one country, no matter how good their situation, cannot remain indifferent to the suffering and oppression of the people of other countries because of the great geographical distance; because there is a close relationship between them, although this relationship is not obvious, the suffering of the people of one country affects the people of other countries to a greater or lesser extent. This proves that peace, in order to truly be peace, must be indivisible, and to have peace, there must be freedom and economic independence; because for the people who cannot control their own natural wealth, peace is just an empty word. If the internal affairs of various countries are subject to foreign interference, peace is also just an empty word. If the right of self-determination of the people of all countries to freely choose the system that is most suitable for them and to become masters of their own destiny is not respected, peace will not be peace, and in this case, it is inconceivable to talk about democracy and respect for human rights without respecting the rights of the people of all countries as a collective of people.

The various efforts made by peace advocates since the historic Stockholm Conference have not been in vain. Although the speed of progress is sometimes fast and sometimes slow, the world peace movement is constantly gaining ground; the people of all countries have a clearer understanding of the horrors of a third world war, in which the highly destructive tools invented by human genius will be used; people already know—and this is something the war-mongers do not want to know—that once a third world war breaks out, the instigators of the war will not benefit either, because at the end of the war, there will only be piles of rubble, ashes, scrap iron, and charred corpses left in the world. The few surviving human beings will be disabled and deformed, with neither the ability nor the courage to rebuild a new life on these ruins, on this land that has also been damaged and cannot grow crops.

Therefore, people are more concerned about the struggle to stop the arms race, which has become a heavy burden for the people of all countries; more concerned about the struggle to stop atomic and thermonuclear testing, and to destroy these weapons until they are destroyed, because their mere existence already constitutes a danger; more concerned about the struggle to stop the Cold War—the dangerous prelude to real wars and the root of hatred, distrust, and division among the people of all countries.

In order to continue to implement their war policies and divert the people's attention from the goals of achieving true liberation, the war-mongers portray communism as the greatest danger in Latin America; they demand that the governments of all countries fight communism with all their strength, and call all nationalists who hope that their country's natural resources will serve their own country dangerous communists.

When the political systems in which the people of all countries live oppress them, and when their living needs are not met, they have to seek ways to save the country and survive from any theories, regardless of whether these theories are called communist theories or not.

Mexico began to distribute land to peasants at the height of the 1913 revolution, and on January 6, 1914, it promulgated the Land Law, which is the principle of land reform, which was affirmed in Article 27 of our political constitution promulgated on February 5, 1917 (that is, before the Russian Revolution). However, reactionary forces at home and abroad called our constitution a Bolshevik constitution, because our constitutionalists formulated this constitution only according to the needs of the people.

Mexico has honorably declared in its many years of advocacy that it respects the right of self-determination of all countries and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

Today, all of Mexico advocates peace based on social justice, and the President of the Republic has publicly declared this more than once.

Dear friends, as soon as I arrived in Guangzhou, I had a preliminary impression of the life of this great country. Countless crowds of people boiled up early in the morning, working tensely and proudly for their new China. There, I saw that a modern Guangzhou had appeared in front of the ancient Guangzhou, with modern high-rise buildings everywhere.

I visited a primary school, a university, and the People's Art Museum, where people can appreciate the things created by the skillful hands of Chinese craftsmen; there, I marveled at an ivory carving, and people told me that it was carved with 70,000 characters, with letters so small that they had to be viewed with a magnifying glass. An artist spent ten years creating this miracle, which means strict demands on oneself and arduous and persevering efforts; therefore, it should be concluded that a people who can create this miracle that is invisible to the naked eye can achieve, and are achieving, greater achievements.

There, you can also see the small room where Chairman Mao Zedong worked. There, the first batch of revolutionary cadres were trained, which shows that the greatest cause does not necessarily have to be produced in high-rise buildings. There, I also learned that the second five-year plan was completed in two years. The government is engaged in a huge task, creating a phonetic alphabet that will enable all the people of China, who speak 150 dialects, to read and write.

Once in Beijing, I was able to appreciate its ancient artistic heritage as well as its modern artistic achievements; I saw magnificent high-rise buildings, such as the building we are in front of now, which is an example of modern architectural art, which was built in one year, which embodies the slogan of "more, faster, better, and more economical," and here, I also saw the great Chinese people, who are working hard for their glorious future.

My dear friends, please accept our most sincere congratulations, and please convey our congratulations to your country's admirable people.

Burhan's and General Hara's speeches received bursts of warm applause.

Also present at the reception were Dong Chuncai and Zhou Erfu, Vice Presidents of the China-Latin America Friendship Association, as well as well-known figures from all walks of life in the capital, including Li Da, Hou Debang, Xu Guangping, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Zhixiang, Mei Lanfang, Lao She, and Zhao Puchu.

Chilean peace activist Vantureri and his wife, American writer Strong, and other Latin American friends in Beijing were also invited to attend the reception. (Attached photo)

    包尔汉赞扬拉丁美洲人民正义斗争，哈拉将军指出必需不屈不挠为保卫和平而斗争
    新华社23日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国拉丁美洲友好协会今晚在人民大会堂上海馆东厅举行酒会，热烈欢迎和平战士墨西哥全国和平理事会主席、世界和平理事会理事埃里维尔托·哈拉将军和墨西哥“永恒”杂志编辑何塞·罗萨莱斯先生。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志、包尔汉，中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南出席了今晚的酒会。
    包尔汉在酒会上代表中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国拉丁美洲友好协会对拉丁美洲的朋友哈拉将军和罗萨莱斯先生表示热烈的欢迎。他说，墨西哥人民有着反对帝国主义及民族、民主运动的光荣传统。哈拉将军多年来一直是墨西哥的杰出的和平战士。我们对哈拉将军的来访感到荣幸。他的访问必将进一步加强中国人民同墨西哥人民的友谊。
    包尔汉着重地说，中国人民热烈支持墨西哥人民、古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民的斗争，我们并且感谢他们对中国人民的支持。中国人民永远站在拉丁美洲人民一边。拉丁美洲人民反对美国侵略、争取和维护民族独立的斗争，对保卫世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。在目前世界人民反帝斗争的力量空前壮大，帝国主义已日暮途穷的形势下，我们相信，拉丁美洲人民团结一致，坚持斗争，一定能不断取得新的胜利。
    包尔汉最后说，我们请哈拉将军和罗萨莱斯先生把中国人民的心意带给墨西哥和拉丁美洲人民。
    哈拉将军在热烈的掌声中讲话。全文如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    我们衷心地感谢你们以中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国拉丁美洲友好协会的名义给予我们的诚挚的接待。近来由于我的健康不佳很多年来一直没有能够实现我访问这个伟大国家的宿愿。今天，由于参加本月2—9日在东京举行的第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的中国代表朋友们的善意邀请，我荣幸地来到了这个伟大国家，这个国家一向充满了奇迹，而今天更是充满了奇迹、光明和范例。
    这里，我以我个人的名义并代表墨西哥的和平拥护者和中国—墨西哥友好协会致亲切的问候。他们正当地关注着中国的发展和前途，正像关心全世界各国人民的前途一样，因为我们深信，和平是不可分的，也正是因此，假如有些人民享受着和平，而另一些人民生活在不安之中，那就不是正义和完全的和平。墨西哥有很多中国侨民，从古老的年代起，我们就有机会赞叹中国劳动者勤恳有恒的劳动，而现在唯独我有机会看到他们在新生活中满腔热情地工作，新生活为他们开辟了无可置疑的新天地。
    在几次和平代表大会上我曾愉快地得与杰出的中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若先生亲近，当他在斯德哥尔摩主持最近一次的代表大会发表闭幕演说时，他的具有深刻道义及和平内容的言辞当之无愧地博得了热烈的掌声，当时全场代表起立鼓掌达数分钟之久。
    最近在东京举行的第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会是令人十分感兴趣的。在那里可以清楚地看到日本人民的感情，他们反对一切战争准备和一切可以把他们投入反和平行动的东西。他们不要军事条约，也不要在他们的领土上建立导弹发射基地；他们热烈地要求琉球群岛归还日本，并且一再指出，美国人在那里建立的庞大的军事基地是对中国的威胁，他们不愿意中国受到威胁。
    参加这次有重大意义会议的有几乎所有各国人民的代表；我们各个不同种族的代表紧密团结一致地到了那里，我们所关心的都是同一个事业：持久的和平。在筹备大会工作的分组会议上，矿工、农民、教师、铁路工人等等都热烈地表示了这一愿望。
    在一个晴朗的下午，我们聚会在一个美丽的公园中，长途游行的队伍一万人浩浩荡荡地来到了这里，他们来自日本各个地区，人人都代表千百万不要战争的日本人带来了和平的信件。每个“游行者”都举着色彩鲜艳的旗帜，拿着写有和平口号的标语牌。其中有神父、穆斯林和佛教徒，他们在虔诚地作了简短的祈祷之后，发表了热情洋溢的演说，谴责战争，颂扬和平。
    在大会进行会议时，宽广的会议厅几乎容纳不下全体到会代表。这表明了日本人民对和平的极度关心。
    中国代表在这次令人难忘的会议上的十分热诚的态度，令我常常想起这个伟大的民族的高贵品德。他们虽然在不多几年以前同日本浴血作战，争取收复失地，然而他们毫无记恨之心，派来了他们的代表。这些代表令人钦佩地完成了自己的工作，中国人民深深知道战争不是人民的事情，尤其是在现代，而是帝国主义和军国主义力量驱迫他们去干的。
    我们曾经不止一次地说，只要人民不要战争，战争就不会发生，假如各国人民同自己的政府有紧密的联系，像中国的情况那样，战争就更加打不起来。然而，光是说不要战争、渴望和平还是不够的，还必需不屈不挠地为达到这点而斗争，不但是暂时保持住和平，而且要永久保持和平。
    我曾经听到一位中国朋友在发言中说，光是滔滔不绝地演讲、满口华丽、矫饰的言辞，并不就是为和平做了工作，而是要使言辞符合实际，不是那样漂亮动听也没关系，却一定要真挚。
    这个意见是很正确的，因为假如过去和现在并非真心诚意地发表的拥护和平的漂亮辞句有重量的话，这些辞句也该有好几百万吨重了。
    在这个伟大的集会上，人们谈到普遍裁军、谈到必需不断努力达到目的；谈到被战争政策分裂的各国人民要团结起来；谈到联合国应当按本份履行它的义务，给予中华人民共和国它所应得的地位，不许背离旧金山宪章的条文，同时要美洲国家组织不能成为美国政府的附属机构，而应履行它的崇高使命。
    人民越来越清楚地看到和平的意义，看到是什么东西影响和平，什么东西对和平有利。看到这种情况，是令人十分欢欣鼓舞的。
    人民一天天深深地认识到，从来也没有像今天这样，一国人民不论处境如何好，对于他国人民的痛苦和受压迫，不能因为地理上隔着很大的距离就无动于衷；因为他们之间是有密切关系的，尽管这种关系并不显著，一国人民的苦难在或大或小的程度上对他国人民发生影响。这证明了，和平要真正成其为和平，必然要是不可分割的，要有和平，就要有自由和经济独立；因为对于不能主宰自己的天然财富的人民说来，和平不过是一句空话。假如各国人民的内部事务受到外来干涉，和平也不过是一句空话。假如各国人民自由地选择于他们最合适的制度并成为自己命运的主宰的自决权得不到尊重，和平也就不成其为和平，在这种情况下，空谈什么民主和尊重人权而却不尊重作为人的集体的各国人民的权利，那是不可思议的。
    和平拥护者从历史性的斯德哥尔摩会议以来所作的种种努力，并不是白费的。虽然前进的速度有紧有慢，世界和平运动是不断地取得阵地的；各国人民已更清楚地懂得第三次大战的恐怖，在这次大战中人类天才所发明的具有高度破坏性的工具将被使用；人民已经知道——这一点是战争贩子所不愿意知道的——一旦发生第三次大战，战争的发动者也得不到好处，因为在战争结束时，世界上只剩下一堆堆的瓦砾，灰烬，废铁和烧焦了的尸体。劫后余生的少数人类将是残废畸形的，既无能力也无勇气在这些瓦砾堆上、在这片也同样遭到损害并且不能长庄稼的土地上重建新生活。
    因此，人们更加关心争取停止已成为各国人民重担的军备竞赛的斗争了；更加关心争取制止原子和热核子试验、直至销毁这些武器的斗争了，因为仅仅它们的存在就已经构成了一种危险；更加关心争取制止冷战——真枪实弹的战争的危险序幕和各国人民间仇恨、不信任和分裂的根源——的斗争了。
    战争贩子为了继续执行战争政策，转移人民对于实现真正解放的目标的注意力，就把共产主义说成拉丁美洲最大的危险；他们要求各国政府全力与共产主义斗争，把一切希望他们祖国自然资源为本国服务的民族主义者称为危险的共产党人。
    当各国人民所处的政治制度压制他们，当他们生活的需要得不到满足时，他们就不得不从任何理论寻求救亡图存之道，也不管这些理论是不是叫做共产主义理论。
    墨西哥在1913年革命的高潮中开始把土地分给农民，1914年1月6日颁布了土地法，这是土地改革的原则，它在1917年2月5日（即在俄国革命之前）颁布的我国政治宪法第二十七条中得到肯定。然而，国内外的反动势力都把我们的宪法称做布尔什维克宪法，这是因为我们的立宪者制订这个宪法时只是按照人民的需要办事。
    墨西哥荣誉地在它多年的主张中宣布过尊重各国人民的自决权和不干涉他国内政的主张。
    全墨西哥今天都主张以社会正义为基础的和平，共和国总统就曾不止一次地公开宣布过这一点。
    亲爱的朋友们，我一到达广州，就对这个伟大的国家的生活有了初步的印象。数不尽的人群一清早就沸腾起来了，他们为了他们的新中国紧张而自豪地工作。在那里，我看到，在古老的广州面前出现了现代化的广州，到处是现代化的高楼大厦。
    我参观了一所小学、一所大学和人民艺术博物馆，在那里，人们可以欣赏到中国手工艺人们心灵手巧地创造出的东西；在那里，我对一幅象牙雕刻惊叹不已，人们对我说，那上面刻有七万个字，字体小到必须用放大镜才看得着。一个艺人用了十年的时间来创造这个奇迹，这就意味着对自己的严格要求和刻苦坚毅的努力；因此，应该得出结论，一个能够作出这种肉眼看不到的奇迹的人民，能够取得，并且正在取得更大的成就。
    在那里，也可以看到毛泽东主席先生工作的小房间。在那里，培养和训练出了第一批革命干部，这就表明了，最伟大的事业并不一定要产生在高楼大厦中。在那里，我还得悉，第二个五年计划在两年内完成了。政府正在从事巨大的任务，在制造一种拼音文字，要使说一百五十种方言的全中国人民都能用这种文字来读和写。
    一到北京，我能够欣赏到它的古代的艺术遗产以及它的现代的艺术成就；我看到华丽的高楼大厦，比如我们现在眼前这所大厦就是一个例子，它是现代建筑艺术的范例，在一年里面就建立了起来，它体现了“多、快、好、省”的口号，在这里，我也看到了伟大的中国人民，正在为他们光荣的未来而辛勤地劳动着。
    我亲爱的朋友们，请您们接受我们最真诚的祝贺，并请把我们的祝贺转达给贵国令人钦佩的人民。
    包尔汉和哈拉将军的讲话获得了一阵一阵的热烈掌声。
    出席酒会的还有中国拉丁美洲友好协会副会长董纯才、周而复，以及首都各界知名人士李达、侯德榜、许广平、蔡廷锴、张致祥、梅兰芳、老舍、赵朴初等。
    在北京的智利和平人士万徒勒里和夫人，美国作家斯特朗和其他拉丁美洲的朋友也应邀出席了酒会。（附图片）
