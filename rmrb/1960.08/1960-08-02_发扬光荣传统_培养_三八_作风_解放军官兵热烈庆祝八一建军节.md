Xinhua News Agency, August 1st -- The various services and arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, focusing on carrying forward glorious traditions and cultivating the "March 8th" style, have launched activities to celebrate the 33rd anniversary of Army Day.

In recent days, all units have held celebration meetings and report meetings to vigorously promote the glorious traditions and fine style of the People's Army. Some heroic units that have repeatedly performed meritorious deeds in past wars have also held "passing on the family style" forums to introduce the glorious history of their units to new soldiers. When a certain Red Army regiment in the Shenyang area held a celebration meeting for the 32nd anniversary of its founding, General Zeng Shaoshan encouraged them at the meeting to maintain their honor and carry it forward. Major General Yang Junsheng, who served as the political instructor of the Ninth Company of a certain unit during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, also returned to this company to celebrate the festival with the soldiers, and told everyone about the history of the company and the stories of the Long March, encouraging everyone to work hard and strive for progress. Before the festival, the Kunming area troops launched a publicity week to promote the "March 8th" style, and many heroes and model figures went to various units to introduce their heroic deeds and talk about their fine style, encouraging everyone to maintain and carry forward the glorious traditions of the People's Army.

Leading cadres and organ cadres who are helping with work in the companies and scattered units are spending the festival with the soldiers today. Some of them are discussing the glorious history of our army with the soldiers, and some are having a get-together with the soldiers. Colonel Guo Kaifeng of a certain unit even performed a living newspaper play with the soldiers. The soldiers said that the actions of the vast number of cadres eating, living, and entertaining with the soldiers during the festival are another lesson in the "old Eighth Route Army" style for them. Many cadres who remained in the organs of many troops also rushed to the companies early this morning to congratulate the soldiers on the festival. The leading organs of many air force units also organized comfort groups, bringing books and cultural and recreational equipment to the island troops and scattered execution units to comfort the vast number of soldiers.

In order to review the achievements of the first half of the year and promote the continued leap forward in future work, many troops held dedication meetings and leap forward oath-taking meetings during the celebration of the "August 1st" activities. The Fifth and Eighth Companies of a certain Railway Corps recently completed a large tunnel thirty-nine days ahead of schedule as a gift to "August 1st". A certain unit's repair shop presented an electric rock drill made ahead of schedule to the "August 1st" Army Day. The officers and soldiers of many troops unanimously stated at the oath-taking leap forward meeting that they must step up training, heighten their vigilance, and contribute to defending the motherland and defending world peace.
