"Distant Hybridization" Method for Cultivating New Biological Varieties

    Soviet scientists have used the "distant hybridization" method to cultivate a number of new and improved livestock and crop varieties.

    Soviet scientists used wheat and couch grass hybridization to cultivate a perennial wheat. This wheat can be harvested for grain and green fodder for two or three consecutive years after one planting, without the need for annual sowing. They also hybridized ordinary cattle with various yaks to cultivate new varieties that are large, strong, and have a lot of meat. They hybridized various fish to cultivate various new varieties that can adapt to various environments.

    “远缘杂交”法培育生物新品种
    苏联科学家运用“远缘杂交”方法培育出了一些新的优良的牲畜和农作物品种。
    苏联科学家利用小麦和水草杂交，培育出了一种多年生小麦，这种小麦播种一次可以连续两三年收获粮食和青饲料，而无须每年播种。他们还用普通耕牛同各种犛牛杂交，培育出了体大、力壮、肉多的新品种；把各种鱼进行杂交，培育出具有能适应各种环境的各种新品种。
