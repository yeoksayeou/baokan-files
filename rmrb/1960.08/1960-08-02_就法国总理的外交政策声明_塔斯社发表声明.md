Xinhua News Agency, August 1st—The Soviet TASS agency issued a statement on July 30th regarding the French Prime Minister Debré's statement on the government's foreign policy issues in the National Assembly on July 25th. The TASS statement pointed out: "Soviet leaders believe that this (Debré's) statement runs counter to the aspirations of people of all countries for peace, freedom, and national independence."

The TASS statement said that the French Prime Minister's statement clearly distorts the reasons for the recent increasing tension in the world situation. He completely failed to point out that the recent continuous actions taken by France's allies in NATO—the United States—clearly hoped to intensify the international situation and undermine all the beneficial work done in recent years to improve relations between countries. He brazenly denied that the policies of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, which are permeated with revanchism and militarism, pose a serious threat to the cause of peace in Europe. This statement is very similar to the remarks made by some French leaders before World War II, who spent a lot of effort to paralyze the vigilance of the European people, including the French people.

Some people in France are trying to some extent to whitewash the implementation of France's military and political collusion with the Federal Republic of Germany in front of the French public, and also want to please the head of the West German government before his visit to France.

As for the Congo issue, Debré does not hide that his sympathy is entirely on the side of those who launched armed aggression against the young Republic of the Congo. The TASS statement said that those French figures who advocate continuing the bloody colonial war in Algeria are clearly not accustomed to considering issues in other categories. But it is worth remembering that in modern times, colonialist policies, whether relying on bayonets or economic enslavement, are doomed to bankruptcy sooner or later.

The statement condemned Debré for clamoring for Western countries to unite against the African people who are breaking free from the chains of colonial slavery.

    就法国总理的外交政策声明
    塔斯社发表声明
    新华社1日讯　苏联塔斯社7月30日就法国总理德勃雷7月25日在国民议会上的政府外交政策问题声明发表了一项声明。塔斯社声明中指出：“苏联领导人认为，（德勃雷）这个声明是同各国人民争取和平、自由和民族独立的愿望背道而驰的。”
    塔斯社的声明说，法国总理的声明显然歪曲了最近世界局势日益紧张的原因。他完全没有指出，法国在北大西洋公约组织中的同盟者——美国最近接连不断地采取行动，显然指望以此加剧国际局势，破坏最近几年来在使国与国之间关系健康化方面所作的一切有益的事情。他硬着头皮否认浸透了复仇主义和军国主义精神的德意志联邦共和国政府的政策是对欧洲和平事业的严重威胁。这种声明很像第二次世界大战前夕某些法国领导人的言论，这些人曾经花不少气力来麻痹欧洲人民、也包括法国人民的警惕。
    法国某些人设法在某种程度上在法国公众面前为执行法国同德意志联邦共和国实行军事政治勾结的方针洗刷，还想在西德政府首脑访问法国的前夕讨他的欢心。
    至于谈到刚果事件，德勃雷不隐瞒，他的同情完全是在对年轻的刚果共和国发动武装侵略的那些人那一边。塔斯社声明说，那些主张在阿尔及利亚继续进行血腥殖民战争的法国人士显然不习惯于用另外的范畴来考虑问题。但是不妨记住一点：在现代，殖民主义政策，不论是以刺刀或经济奴役作为依靠，注定不是今天就是明天就要破产的。
    声明谴责德勃雷叫嚷西方国家联合起来对付正在挣脱殖民奴役锁链的非洲人民。
