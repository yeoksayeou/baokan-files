Don't look down on this place because it's small,
Don't look down on this place because it's far,
We have Beijing behind us,
We stand in front, shielding half the sky.
Standing on this small hilltop,
The secretary shook hands with us,
The political commissar chatted with us,
The regimental commander shared a bunk with us,
The general was in the same squad as us,
Whenever the leaders pass by from the sea,
They always come to take a look.
Don't look down on this place because it's small,
Don't look down on this place because it's far,
On that rocky hillside,
We watched the Shanghai Acrobatic Troupe,
In this winding tunnel,
We received the Guangzhou Song and Dance Troupe.
Shenyang sent us care packages,
Chongqing sent us postcards,
Seeds of flowers and vegetables are sent from all over the country,
The small island has become a garden of a hundred flowers.
Don't look down on this place because it's small,
Don't look down on this place because it's far,
In the sky there are airplanes,
In the sea there are warships,
The radio antenna stands tall,
We traverse the rivers and mountains of the motherland,
Travel to the borderlands, tour the regions south of the Yangtze,
The beautiful land is all in our hearts.
We can hear the laughter of our loved ones back home,
We can see the lights of Zhongnanhai shining late into the night,
Looking up while standing guard at night,
We share the same sky as Tiananmen.
Don't look down on this place because it's small,
Don't look down on this place because it's far,
The island is a cruiser,
Our feet are firmly planted on the steel deck,
With Beijing behind us,
We stand in front, shielding half the sky.
The island may be small, but our hearts are vast,
The place may be far, but our path is wide,
We are a flock of eagles in the clouds,
Cliffs and precipices are our foothold.

    咱背后靠着北京城
    西中扬
    莫看这地方小，
    莫看这地方远，
    咱背后靠着北京城，
    咱前面挡住半边天。
    站在这小小山头上，
    书记和咱们握过手，
    政委和咱们谈过天，
    团长曾和咱同铺住，
    将军曾和咱一个班，
    首长们打从海上过，
    哪回不来看一看。
    莫看这地方小，
    莫看这地方远，
    在那边怪石累累的山坡上，
    咱看过上海杂技队，
    在这条曲曲弯弯的坑道里，
    咱接待过广州歌舞团。
    沈阳捎来过慰问袋，
    重庆寄来过明信片，
    五湖四海送来花种和菜籽，
    小岛成了个百花园。
    莫看这地方小，
    莫看这地方远，
    上天有飞机，
    入海有军舰，
    收音机架天线，
    咱走遍祖国的河流祖国的山，
    走塞外，游江南，
    锦绣山河全在咱心里面。
    咱听得到家乡亲人笑，
    咱看得到中南海夜半灯光闪，
    夜晚放哨抬头看，
    咱和那天安门同着一块天。
    别看这地方小，
    别看这地方远，
    海岛是艘巡洋舰，
    咱双脚踏着钢甲板，
    背后靠着北京城，
    前面挡住半边天。
    小岛虽小咱们心胸大，
    地方虽远咱们道路宽，
    咱们是云中一群鹰，
    悬崖峭壁正是咱们的落脚点。
