    Beside the Steel Furnace
    In July, during the campaign to learn from, catch up with, surpass, and create advanced targets, the workers of Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant heard that their hourly steel production was lagging behind Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, and by a significant amount. Unwilling to fall behind, they were determined to surpass Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant.
    To seize the first place was, of course, no simple matter. The workers of Qi Wendong's group launched a discussion on this matter. They decided to break the nine-hour mark with the first heat of steel, firing the first shot in the campaign to catch up with Shanghai. They meticulously operated before and after the furnace, and sure enough, they produced steel in eight hours and thirty-six minutes, setting a new record for the entire plant. Qi Zisheng's group took over. As soon as they arrived at the furnace, Qi Wendong handed over a battle report: "We created a new record with eight hours and thirty-six minutes, but unfortunately, we didn't break eight hours. We hope you can break eight hours today..." Qi Zisheng understood immediately upon seeing the battle report. "Rest assured," he had barely finished speaking when apprentices Deng Yufu and Xue Yinting shouted, "We will definitely break eight hours!" At this moment, the Party Secretary and Plant Director also arrived at the furnace, and the workers' enthusiasm soared even higher. The Plant Director asked Qi Zisheng, "Are you confident? Everyone is counting on you!" Qi Zisheng answered very crisply, "Confident."
    Half an hour later, a dangerous situation suddenly arose: because of the high carbon content, the molten steel surface wouldn't boil. Qi Zisheng directed the workers to add ore. Just as the molten steel began to boil, the lab technician reported, "Sulfur is rising." "Add lime, desulfurize!" Qi Zisheng calmly directed the workers. The sulfur was repelled, and the bell for tapping the steel rang. The boiling steel flowed from the tap hole into the huge steel ladle. This heat of steel only took eight hours and four minutes. Qi Zisheng's group beat gongs and drums and sent a battle report to Yu Junyou's group, who was taking over. Yu Junyou immediately convened an emergency meeting. They analyzed the entire operation process and decided to further shorten the smelting time. The gas furnace section, the laboratory, and the steel casting team all made guarantees, promising to shorten the time in every环节 (huánjié, link or stage), launching another intense steel-grabbing battle. In the past, patching the furnace generally took twenty minutes, but this time it only took two minutes. The loader operator, Lu Wenyun, drove the machine quickly and accurately, reducing the time to add one bucket of material from one minute and nine seconds to one minute, truly racing against time. As a result, this heat of steel only took seven hours and twenty-one minutes. The next day, the competition to catch up and surpass entered a white-hot stage. In ten days, the three shifts of steelmaking workers created nine new records. Finally, Yu Junyou's group created the latest achievement of six hours and forty-eight minutes, surpassing Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, the national red-flag unit in the open-hearth workshop.

    炼钢炉旁
    7月里，在开展学赶超创先进指标运动中，天津第一钢厂的工人听说自己的小时钢产量落后于上海第一钢厂，而且差得很多，谁也不甘落后，坚决要超过上钢一厂。
    要夺第一，这当然不是一件简单的事。齐文栋小组的工人们为这件事展开了讨论。他们决定第一炉钢就打破九小时，为赶上海打响头一炮。他们炉前炉后精心操作，果然用了八小时三十六分钟就出钢了，创造了全厂最新纪录。齐子升小组来接班，刚到炉前，齐文栋就递过去一张战表：“我们以八点三十六分创造了新纪录，可惜没有打破八小时，希望你们能够在今天打破八小时……”。齐子升一看战表，心里明白了。“请你们放心”，他话没说完，徒工邓玉福和薛印亭就喊起来：“一定打破八小时！”这时候，党委书记、厂长也来到炉前，工人们劲头更足了。厂长问齐子升：“有把握吗？大家都看你们哪！”齐子升回答得很干脆：“有把握。”
    半小时以后，突然出现了险情：因为含碳高，钢水面沸腾不起来。齐子升指挥工人加矿石。钢水刚沸腾起来，化验员又来报告：“硫磺上升了。”“加白灰，脱硫！”齐子升镇静地指挥着工人们，硫磺被杀退了，响起了出钢的钟声。沸腾的钢水，从出钢口流进了巨大的钢包。这炉钢只用了八点零四分。齐子升小组敲锣打鼓把一份战表送给接班的于俊友小组。于俊友立刻召集了紧急会议，他们分析了整个操作过程，决定再把熔炼时间缩短。煤气炉工段、化验室、铸钢班，都来下保证，保证每一个环节都缩短时间，一场紧张的夺钢大战又开始了。过去补炉一般要用二十分钟，这次只用了两分钟；加料机工人卢文运开车又快又准，加一斗料，由一分九秒缩短到一分钟，真是争分夺秒。结果这炉钢只用了七小时二十一分。第二天，你追我赶更进入了白热化，十天里三班炼钢工人九创新纪录，最后于俊友小组以六小时四十八分创造了最新成绩，超过了全国平炉车间红旗单位的上海第一钢厂。　（嘉瑞）
