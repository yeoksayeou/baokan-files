Thwart the Conspiracy of West German Warmongers
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

The West German militarist forces, revived single-handedly by U.S. imperialism, apparently believe that their wings have fully grown and that they can blatantly accelerate preparations for wars of aggression. The West German “Bundeswehr” General Staff recently published a memorandum demanding the expansion of West German military strength, proposing the implementation of universal conscription in West Germany and the equipping of the West German army with tactical nuclear weapons. This is a reckless program of war preparations. After holding consultations, West German Chancellor Adenauer and Defense Minister Strauss expressed their full agreement with these proposals. This means that, under the protection of U.S. imperialism, West German militarists, ignoring the strong opposition of the people of the world, brazenly decided to accelerate their journey down the dangerous road of revenge and aggression.

Anyone who is not forgetful can see that the Adenauer clique is following Hitler's old path. In the 1930s, Hitler expanded the military strength of Nazi Germany step by step in a “piecemeal” manner, from rebuilding the army to mastering the most modern weapons of the time. When he believed he had sufficient strength, he launched a war of aggression. Today, under the support of the United States, the Adenauer clique has built the strongest military force within the North Atlantic Group and is in fact being equipped with nuclear weapons. The U.S. authorities have repeatedly and openly advocated allowing West Germany to manufacture "offensive" weapons; at the instigation of the United States, the Western European Union is abolishing the ban on West Germany manufacturing missile weapons and large warships for launching nuclear rockets. Recently, the Adenauer clique, under the pretext of seeking "living space," is planning to establish military bases in Spain, France, Italy, and other places. And people like Adenauer have openly clamored to "recover" the former territories of eastern Germany. How similar are their bellicose tones to Hitler's howls back then!

It is not difficult for people to imagine what the West German militarists will do when they have nuclear weapons in their hands. The West German "Bundeswehr's" official publication, "Defense Knowledge" magazine, recently wrote a very blunt passage when commenting on the West German generals' request to possess new weapons. It said: "If we had possessed the atomic bomb in World War II, then Leningrad would have been destroyed and Moscow would have been atomized. Therefore, there is no doubt as to why the Federal Defense Forces demand to possess atomic weapons no matter what." Of course, it is no secret that the Adenauer clique is determined to act as the vanguard of the offensive against socialist countries. But since Hitler started his adventure by marching towards the West, then, in today's socialist camp, which is so powerful, who can guarantee that when the West German militarists want to launch an aggression, they will not use this weapon against their current "allies"? Therefore, this document published by the West German "Bundeswehr" is indeed a weighty memorandum for the ruling groups of Western European countries who have forgotten the historical lessons of the two world wars and are pursuing the policy of rearming West Germany following U.S. imperialism.

It is imperative to stop the West German militarists' atomic arms race conspiracy! It is imperative to smash the U.S. imperialists' heinous policy of accelerating the rearmament of West Germany.

    制止西德战争狂人的阴谋
    本报评论员
    由美帝国主义一手复活的西德军国主义势力，显然认为它已经羽毛渐丰，可以明目张胆地加紧进行侵略战争的准备了。西德“国防军”参谋部最近发表了一项要求扩充西德军事实力的备忘录，提出要在西德实行普遍义务兵役制和用战术原子武器装备西德军队。这是一个狂妄的备战行动纲领。而西德总理阿登纳和国防部长施特劳斯在举行会商之后，表示完全同意这些主张。这就是说，西德的军国主义者在美帝国主义的庇护之下，不顾世界人民的强烈反对，悍然决心加速奔向复仇和侵略的危险道路。
    每一个并不健忘的人都可以看得出，阿登纳集团正在走着希特勒的老路。希特勒在三十年代就是“得寸进尺”地一步一步扩充纳粹德国的军事力量，从重建军队一直到掌握当时最现代化的武器。等到他认为已经拥有充足的实力，他就发动了侵略战争。今天阿登纳集团在美国扶持下已经建立起了在北大西洋集团内最强大的军事力量，并且事实上正在用原子武器装备起来。美国的当权人物一再公开鼓吹要让西德制造“进攻性”武器；在美国的怂恿下，西欧联盟正在取消限制西德制造导弹武器以及发射核火箭的大型军舰的禁令。最近阿登纳集团在寻求“生存空间”的借口下，正策划在西班牙、法国、意大利等地建立军事基地。而阿登纳之流已经公然叫嚣要“收复”以前德国东部的领土。他们那种好战的声调同希特勒当年的嚎叫也是何等的相似！
    人们不难设想，当西德军国主义者手里有了原子武器以后，他们将会干出什么事情来。西德“国防军”的机关刊物“国防知识”杂志最近在评述西德将军们要求拥有新式武器时所写的一段话是说得十分露骨的。它说：“如果我们在第二次世界大战中已拥有原子弹，那么列宁格勒就被消灭，莫斯科被原子化了。因此丝毫不能怀疑为什么联邦国防军无论如何要求拥有原子武器。”当然阿登纳集团一心想要充当进攻社会主义国家的急先锋，这并不是什么秘密。但是既然希特勒是从向西方进军开始他的冒险事业的，那末，在社会主义阵营如此强大的今天，谁能保证当西德军国主义者一旦要发动侵略的时候不会对他们现在的“盟友”使用这种武器呢？因此，西德“国防军”发表的这份文件，对于那些已经忘记了两次世界大战历史教训而追随美帝国主义重新武装西德政策的西欧国家的统治集团来说，的确是一份很有分量的备忘录。
    一定要制止西德军国主义者的原子备战的阴谋！一定要粉碎美帝国主义加紧重新武装西德的罪恶政策。
