Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 19th: Cadres of Xincheng County's directly subordinate 机关, enterprises, and institutions in Guangxi are diligently and thriftily practicing increased production and economy, saving more than 120,000 yuan in expenses in the past six months.

In accordance with the spirit of "running all undertakings through diligence and thrift," the Xincheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China called on cadres and employees of directly subordinate 机关 and enterprises at the beginning of this year to vigorously launch a movement to increase production and practice economy, and to produce as much staple and non-staple food as possible. This call from the County Committee was warmly responded to by more than 630 cadres from directly subordinate 机关 and enterprises. This spring, 315 cadres stationed in 机关, led by Yuan Bangdian, the first secretary of the CPC County Committee, used their spare time to reclaim wasteland and plant 566 mu of grain crops such as corn and early rice, 5,782 mu of crops such as edamame, cassava, pigeon peas, and red cassava, and 293 mu of oil crops. Now, the harvested early rice and early corn totaled more than 87,600 jin, which can provide all cadres with food for more than four months; the harvested early peanuts can be pressed into more than 1,300 jin of oil, enough for all cadres to eat for eight months. On the already harvested land, 775.7 mu of late corn, autumn red cassava, and late rice have been planted. Various units have also vigorously raised pigs and fish, and bred chickens and ducks. There are now 514 pigs, 2,553 chickens and ducks, and 120,000 fish in stock. Various units also made full use of small vacant lots beside houses, ditches, and roads to grow melons and vegetables.

While increasing production, various 机关 and enterprises also practiced thrift and reduced expenses. The County Military Service Bureau saved 860 yuan in expenses in the first half of the year by building pig pens, mining coal, and transporting coal themselves. When the four agricultural middle schools established by the county were opened, teachers and students worked together, felling wood and making tables and chairs themselves. Bricks, tiles, and lime were all burned by themselves, saving a total of 16,000 yuan in expenses. According to statistics from various directly subordinate units, a total of more than 123,600 yuan in expenses (including capital construction expenses) was saved in the first half of the year.

In carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, the directly subordinate 机关 of Xincheng County paid great attention to implementing the principle of ensuring that work and production are not delayed, and that there is a combination of work and rest. They generally use the rest time after dinner to carry out production in small units. In the case of seizing the agricultural season, they adopt the method of short-term shock tactics, completing the production task in one or two days, and then continuing to work and study as usual.

    增加生产　厉行节约　减少开支
    忻城县级机关勤俭过日子
    据新华社南宁19日电　广西忻城县直属机关和事业、企业单位的干部，克勤克俭，厉行增产节约，半年来节约了经费开支十二万多元。
    中共忻城县委根据“勤俭办一切事业”的精神，今年初就号召县直属机关干部和企业单位的职工，大力开展增产节约运动，尽量多生产主副食品。县委的这个号召受到了直属机关和事业、企业单位六百三十多名干部的热烈响应。今年春季，留驻机关的三百一十五名干部在中共县委第一书记袁邦殿率领下，利用业余时间，开垦荒地，种玉米、早稻等粮食作物五百六十六亩，毛豆、木茹、木豆、红茹等五千七百八十二亩，油料作物二百九十三亩。现在，已经收获的早稻和早玉米共有八万七千六百多斤，可供所有干部吃四个多月；收获的早花生可榨油一千三百多斤，够全体干部吃八个月。在已经收获的土地上，又种下晚玉米、秋红茹、晚稻共七百七十五点七亩。各单位还大力养猪养鱼，繁殖鸡鸭，现在共有存栏猪五百一十四头、鸡鸭二千五百五十三只、鱼十二万尾。各单位并充分利用屋边、沟边、路边的小块空地，大种瓜菜。
    在增加生产的同时，各机关和事业、企业单位还厉行节约，减少经费开支。县兵役局上半年自己造猪栏、自己挖煤、运煤，节约开支八百六十元。县设的四所农业中学在开办时师生一齐动手，自己砍伐木料，自己制造桌椅，砖瓦、石灰都是自己烧的，共节约经费一万六千元。据各直属单位统计，上半年共节约经费（包括基本建设经费在内）十二万三千六百多元。
    忻城县直属机关在开展增产节约运动中，十分注意贯彻工作、生产两不误和劳逸结合的原则。他们一般利用晚饭后的休息时间，以小单位进行生产。在抢农业季节的情况下，他们就采取短期突击的办法，以一两天时间完成生产任务，然后照常办公、学习。
