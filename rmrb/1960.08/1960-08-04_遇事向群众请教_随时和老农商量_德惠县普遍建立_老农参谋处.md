Xinhua News Agency report by reporter Sun Xiuchun: Dehui County, Jilin Province, from the County Party Committee to the Management District Branch, has universally established "Old Farmer Advisory Offices," widely soliciting the opinions of experienced farmers to make work more practical and satisfying to the masses.

The farmers participating in the Old Farmer Advisory Offices are all poor peasants, hired farmhands, or lower-middle peasants, possessing rich production experience and high prestige among the masses. Most of them are elderly, but some are young and middle-aged. Currently, the County Party Committee's "Old Farmer Advisory Office" has thirteen members, while the Commune Party Committees and Management District Branches have "Old Farmer Advisory Offices (Groups)" with five to nine members each. Furthermore, the secretaries and members of the Party committees at all levels regularly maintain contact with two or three experienced farmers in their assigned areas, treating them as their advisors. A total of 7,250 farmers throughout the county participate in the Old Farmer Advisory Offices.

More than a year of practice has proven that this method is a concrete application of the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses," and an effective form for cadres to consult with the masses while participating in and leading production. Before implementing directives from higher Party committees or deploying new work tasks, or when encountering difficulties in production technology, the County Party Committee, Commune Party Committees, and Management District Branches, in addition to widely mobilizing the masses for discussion, hold Old Farmer Advisory Meetings to seek advice from experienced farmers. They gather the farmers' scattered and unsystematic opinions, then, after further discussion and research by the Party committee, ensure that the Party committee's decisions comply with the directives of the higher Party committee and align with the local realities. This year's county-wide close planting and other technical plans, for example, were formulated based on directives from higher authorities and the broad absorption of opinions from experienced farmers and other peasants. After the plans were issued, they were actively supported by the masses. This year, most of the county's land was rationally densely planted according to this plan, greatly changing the past tendency of some areas to be either too sparse or too dense.

During the spring planting season this year, the provincial and municipal Party committees advocated intercropping and multiple cropping. The Party committees at all levels in Dehui County organized experienced farmers to discuss specific methods. Under the leadership of the Party committees, the experienced farmers jointly compiled vivid slogans: "Sorghum with soybeans, both crops have good yields. Sorghum doesn't decrease, but you gain two *shi* of beans; Corn with soybeans, short and tall yield the same. Corn doesn't decrease, but you gain five *shi* of beans; Millet with sorghum, plant one meter apart, each plant weighs two *liang*, you can harvest eight *shi* of grain; Potatoes with gourds, the ground is full of yellow and white flowers, you will harvest 30,000 (*jin*) of beans below, and 100,000 (*jin*) of gourds above." These slogans not only introduced intercropping methods but also explained their benefits. The whole county used these slogans to publicize to the masses, coupled with other measures, and as a result, half of the county's cultivated land was intercropped or multiple-cropped this year.

The secretaries of the County Party Committee, Commune Party Committees, and Management District Branches all regard experienced farmers as their capable advisors, consulting them on everything, discussing issues with them anytime and anywhere, whether in the fields or in the canteens. Many leading comrades feel that by constantly absorbing the reasonable opinions of experienced farmers, they are more confident in implementing the directives of higher Party committees, more certain in guiding production, and also more likely to prevent bureaucratism and subjectivism.

The Old Farmer Advisory Offices have played a very good role in strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses. The experienced farmers not only reflect the opinions of the masses to the Party committee from the perspective of production technology, but also reflect the opinions and thoughts of the masses from all aspects of business management and life arrangements. After attending meetings at the County Party Committee and Commune Party Committees, many experienced farmers actively publicize the Party's decisions to the masses. If the masses do not understand, they patiently explain and take the lead in implementing them, setting an example for the masses and leading them to work together. Now, many experienced farmers have been rated as outstanding commune members and advanced producers, and some have joined the Communist Party of China. Last year, the higher authorities called for planting soybeans by poking holes. Some commune members were reluctant to plant because they found it troublesome. The Wutai Commune held three Old Farmer Advisory Office meetings to study technical measures. The experienced farmers all said: "Soybeans and wheat yield the same; planting soybeans by poking holes is good." After they returned, they widely publicized the benefits of planting soybeans by poking holes to the masses and took the lead in implementing them. As a result, 90% of the soybeans in the whole commune were planted by poking holes, and a bumper harvest was achieved, with an average yield of more than 6,000 *jin* of soybeans per hectare on 2,000 hectares. Now, the masses often reflect their opinions to the experienced farmers participating in the Old Farmer Advisory Offices, letting them bring them to the Party committee. The responsible cadres of the Party committee also regard the experienced farmers as their confidants, caring for them politically and in their lives.

### 遇事向群众请教　随时和老农商量  德惠县普遍建立“老农参谋处”

    遇事向群众请教　随时和老农商量
    德惠县普遍建立“老农参谋处”
    据新华社讯　记者孙修纯报道：吉林省德惠县从中共县委到管理区支部，普遍建立了“老农参谋处”，广泛吸收老农的意见，使工作更加切合实际，群众满意。
    参加老农参谋处的农民，全部是贫雇农或下中农，都有着丰富的生产经验，在群众中的威信也高。他们大部分是老年，也有一部分是青壮年。现在，县委“老农参谋处”有十三人，公社党委、管理区支部的“老农参谋处（组）”有五人到九人；各级党委书记和委员，还在分工的片里经常联系两三名老农，作自己的参谋。全县参加老农参谋处的农民共有七千二百五十人。
    一年多来的实践证明，这种方法是“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线的具体运用，是干部在参加生产、领导生产的过程中同群众商量的一种有效形式。县委、公社党委和管理区支部，在贯彻上级党委指示、布置新的工作任务之前，或者在碰到生产技术上的困难时，除了广泛发动群众讨论以外，都召开老农参谋会议，向老农请教，把农民分散的、不系统的意见集中起来，然后经过党委再次讨论研究，使党委的决定既符合上级党委的指示，又符合当地的实际情况。如今年的全县密植等技术方案，就是根据上级指示和广泛吸收老农和其它农民的意见制定的。方案下达后，群众积极拥护。今年全县大部分土地是按这个方案合理密植的，大大改变了过去某些地方过稀或过密的偏向。
    今年春播时，省、市委都提倡间种、套种，德惠县各级党委就组织老农讨论具体办法。老农们在党委领导下，共同编出了生动的口号：“高粱带小豆，两样齐丰收，高粱不少打，外捞两石豆；苞米带大豆，高矮一样收，苞米不少收，多得五石豆；谷子带高粱，株距一米长，每棵算二两，能收八石粮；土豆带窝瓜，满地黄白花，下收三万（斤）豆，上收十万（斤）瓜”；既介绍了间种的方法，又说明了它的好处。全县就用这些口号向群众宣传，加上其它措施，结果今年全县有一半的耕地进行了间种、套种。
    县委、公社党委和管理区支部的书记，都把老农当作自己得力的参谋，遇事就向他们请教，在地头上，在食堂里，随时随地和老农商量问题。许多领导同志感觉到，随时吸收老农的合理意见，对贯彻上级党委的指示，心里更有底了，指导生产更有把握，也容易防止官僚主义和主观主义。
    老农参谋处对于密切党与群众的联系起了很好的作用。老农们不仅从生产技术上向党委反映一些群众的意见，还从经营管理、生活安排等各方面反映群众的意见和思想情况。许多老农到县委、公社党委开会回去以后，都积极向群众宣传党的决定，群众如果思想不通，他们就耐心解释，并且带头执行，给群众作出样子，带领群众一起去干。现在，许多老农已被评为优秀社员、先进生产者，有的还加入了中国共产党。去年，上级号召扎眼种大豆，有些社员嫌麻烦不愿种，五台公社召开了三次老农参谋处会议，研究技术措施，老农都说：豆打旁秸麦打齐，扎眼种大豆就是好。他们回去后广泛地向群众宣传扎眼种大豆的好处，并且带头执行，结果全公社90％的大豆是扎眼种的，获得了丰收，其中有二千公顷平均每公顷产大豆六千多斤。现在，群众往往把自己的意见向参加老农参谋处的老农反映，让他们带给党委。党委的负责干部，也把老农当作自己的知心朋友，从政治上、生活上关心他们。
