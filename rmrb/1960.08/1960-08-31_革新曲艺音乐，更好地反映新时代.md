Innovating quyi music is an indispensable part of quyi creation. Every type of quyi has its own set of singing styles, melodies, performance, and accompaniment forms, each with its own characteristics. However, these elements are never static; they are constantly developing and changing through innovation and creation. Throughout history, outstanding artists have made remarkable contributions to the innovation and creation of quyi music. Their rich experiences are worth summarizing and inheriting well. However, never before has there been such an urgent need for more and bolder innovation and creation in music. This is because our era is fundamentally different from the past. Our quyi, though with a long history, only developed in class-exploitative societies in the past. Today, it has entered a brand-new socialist society, a socialist new era unlike any other. We want to express the spirit of the socialist era, to portray new heroic figures with communist ideological consciousness, and to express the feelings of the new era, the feelings of the proletariat. Such new life, new people, new ideas, and new feelings are not only fundamentally different from the love lives of talented scholars and beautiful ladies, but also vastly different from the struggles of peasant revolutionary heroes like Li Kui. Therefore, without bold innovation and creation on the basis of the original music, it is impossible to give a true and perfect artistic expression to the new content of life. This has been proven by the facts: Many excellent quyi pieces reflecting modern life created in recent years, especially in the last two years, have carried out bold innovation and creation in music. Moreover, these innovations and creations are not carried out spontaneously, but consciously.

The central link in the innovation and creation of quyi music is the development of singing styles, that is, creating new melodies. Of course, the innovation of accompaniment and performance forms is necessary and important. However, if we only one-sidedly emphasize the innovation of accompaniment and performance forms and ignore the development of singing styles, even if the number of instruments is increased and the music is made more complex, the work will still lack artistic power without a profound and moving singing style suitable for the new content. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to give sufficient attention to the development of singing styles. In the new quyi creation, everyone is brave enough to break through the old conventions, boldly develop and innovate the original singing styles, and absorb nutrients from folk songs, operas, brotherly quyi genres, and even mass songs and new operas to enrich themselves. This has greatly strengthened the ability of singing styles to express new content of life. Many quyi genres, such as Shanghai's Pingtan and Sichuan's Qingyin, have achieved remarkable results in this regard. Even Beijing Qinshu, which is considered more difficult, has been bolder in the innovation of singing styles in the past two years and has achieved more significant results. These achievements must be fully affirmed. Although it is always necessary to pay attention to fully exploring and utilizing the expressive power of the music of this genre, giving full play to its own characteristics and strengths in the innovation of quyi singing styles. But today's problem is that the leap forward of the times is too fast, and the changes in real life are too great. Under these circumstances, to use the old singing styles unchanged to express the new life, there will inevitably be sharp contradictions between them. Therefore, according to the needs of the new content of life, boldly innovating and creating quyi singing styles is of even more urgent significance.

The innovation of singing styles is closely related to the innovation of accompaniment and performance forms, and they jointly complete the task of expressing new content of life. The enrichment and strengthening of accompaniment has been widely valued by quyi workers. In the past, quyi in many places only used one or two instruments for accompaniment. Now, it is more common to add more, so that the accompaniment music has richer colors and expressiveness. In terms of performance forms, some programs have also appropriately adopted the forms of duet and chorus. Such innovations and developments help quyi art to more powerfully express the spirit of our times and the revolutionary enthusiasm and heroic spirit of the people. This should be affirmed; however, we cannot one-sidedly emphasize increasing the number of performers and accompanists while ignoring the convenient form of one or two people singing and performing, which is conducive to going deep into the masses.

Further developing socialist new quyi is not only the task of quyi workers, but also a problem that musical workers should be commonly concerned about.

Since liberation, we have continuously waged a resolute struggle against the bourgeois ideology of belittling the national musical heritage and blindly worshiping Western music among music workers, so that the majority of music workers have deepened their understanding of the national music tradition in the process of learning from the national musical heritage. For quyi music, which has significant characteristics in our country's musical art, we also recognize that it has a rich heritage, excellent traditions, and a high degree of artistic expressiveness. Learning from quyi music has become an indispensable course for the majority of music workers and music students. By learning quyi, not only have music workers expanded and deepened their knowledge of the national musical tradition, but it has also directly contributed to the nationalization of new musical creation and performance, and enriched the genres and styles of musical creation and performance. In the creation of new operas and other vocal and instrumental music, not only are the performance methods and creative experiences of quyi music used in large quantities, but some works also use quyi music materials for creation. In terms of vocal music, vocal music workers have been greatly helped in accurately articulating the sounds of words, vividly processing language, and expressing emotions by learning to sing quyi. Even music workers engaged in instrumental performance have learned a lot of experience from quyi music. All of this has greatly promoted the nationalization of new musical creation and performance. In addition to learning from and drawing on the rich experience of quyi music, since the Great Leap Forward, more music workers have broken the old framework, directly performing quyi works as their own programs, and some music workers have also used quyi forms for creation. Quyi has become a natural member of the music family, a very characteristic musical genre. Music workers have also done a lot of work in the collection, sorting, and research of quyi music. Some comrades have also carried out preliminary research on the music of quyi. Of course, these works cannot be completed by the sole efforts of music workers, but are completed with the joint efforts of quyi workers. We must continue to develop this close cooperative relationship and work together for the innovation and creation of quyi music.

    革新曲艺音乐，更好地反映新时代
    李元庆
    曲艺音乐的革新，是曲艺创作的一个不可缺少的部分。每一种曲艺都有自己的一套唱腔、曲牌、演唱和伴奏的形式，它们都有着自己的特色；但是，这些东西从来就不是凝固不变的，而是在不断地革新和创造中不停地发展和变化着的。历代优秀的艺术家都对曲艺音乐的革新和创造作过卓越的贡献，他们的丰富的经验，值得我们很好地予以总结和继承；但是从来也没有像今天这样迫切地要求对于音乐有更多更大胆的革新和创造。这是因为我们的时代已经和过去根本不同了。我们的曲艺，历史虽然很长，但过去都只是在阶级剥削的社会里发展的，今天却进入了一个崭新的社会主义社会，一个和过去任何时代都不同的社会主义新时代。我们要表现社会主义的时代风貌，我们要刻划具有共产主义思想觉悟的新的英雄人物，我们所要抒发的是新时代的感情、无产阶级的感情。这样的新生活、新人物、新思想和新感情，不仅和那种才子佳人的爱情生活根本不同，就是和李逵等农民革命英雄们的斗争生活也有着极大的差别。因此，如果不在原有的音乐基础上大胆地革新和创造，就不可能给新的生活内容以真实完美的艺术表达。事实证明了这一点：这些年，特别是近两年来创作的许多反映现代生活的优秀曲目，都在音乐方面进行了大胆的革新和创造。而且这些革新和创造都不是自发地进行，而是自觉地进行的。
    曲艺音乐的革新和创造，中心的环节是发展唱腔，也就是创腔。当然，伴奏和演唱形式的革新都是必需的，也是重要的；但是，如果只是片面地强调了伴奏和演唱形式的革新，忽视了唱腔的发展，尽管乐器的件数加多了，音乐改得更复杂了，要是没有适合于新内容的深刻而动人的唱腔，这作品还是缺少艺术力量的。所以，给予唱腔的发展以足够的重视，是完全必要的。在新的曲艺创作中，大家都勇于突破旧有的常规，对原有的唱腔作了大胆的发展和革新，并且从民歌、戏曲、兄弟曲种、以至群众歌曲和新歌剧中吸取营养来丰富自己。这样就大大地加强了唱腔表现新的生活内容的能力。上海的评弹、四川的清音等许多曲种，都在这方面取得了显著的成绩。就是被认为困难较多的京韵大鼓，这两年来在唱腔的革新上也比从前更大胆，成绩也更显著了。这些成就，是必须给予充分肯定的。虽然，在曲艺唱腔的革新中充分地挖掘和运用本曲种的音乐的表现能力，发挥自己的特点和长处，始终是需要提起注意的。但是今天的问题是，时代的跃进太快了，现实生活的变化太大了。在这种情况下，要用旧有的唱腔原封不动地来表现新的生活，它们之间不可免地要发生尖锐的矛盾。因此，根据新的生活内容的需要，大胆地革新和创造曲艺的唱腔，更有着迫切的意义。
    唱腔的革新和伴奏及演唱形式的革新是密切地联系着的，它们共同完成表现新的生活内容的任务。伴奏的丰富和加强，受到了曲艺工作者普遍的重视。在过去，许多地方的曲艺都只用一两件乐器作伴奏，现在比较普遍地有所增添，使伴奏的音乐有了更丰富的色彩和表现力。在演唱形式方面，有一些节目也适当地采用了对唱和齐唱的形式。这样的一些革新和发展，有助于曲艺艺术去更有力地表现我们时代的精神，表现人民群众的革命热情和英雄气概，这是应当肯定的；但不能片面地强调增加演唱和伴奏的人数，而忽视了便于深入群众的一、二人说唱的轻便形式。
    进一步发展社会主义的新曲艺，不仅是曲艺工作者的任务，也是音乐工作者应该共同关心的问题。
    解放以来，我们在音乐工作者中间不断地和轻视民族音乐遗产、盲目崇拜西洋音乐的资产阶级思想进行了坚决的斗争，使广大音乐工作者在向民族音乐遗产学习的过程中加深了对于民族音乐传统的认识。对于我国音乐艺术中具有显著特点的曲艺音乐，也认识到它有着丰富的遗产，优秀的传统，以及高度的艺术表现力。向曲艺音乐学习，已经成为广大音乐工作者和音乐学生的一个不可缺少的课程。通过学习曲艺，不仅扩大和加深了音乐工作者对民族音乐传统的知识，而且直接有助于新的音乐创作和表演的民族化的发展，并且丰富了音乐的创作与演出的体裁和样式。在新歌剧及其他声乐和器乐的创作中，不仅曲艺音乐的表现方法和创作经验被大量地运用，还有一些作品采用了曲艺音乐的素材来进行创作。在声乐方面，声乐工作者通过学习演唱曲艺，对于他们准确地咬清字音、生动地处理语言以及表情等方面，都有很大的帮助。就是从事乐器演奏的音乐工作者们，也都从曲艺音乐中学到很多经验。所有这些，都对新的音乐创作和表演的民族化起了很大的推动作用。除了学习和借鉴曲艺音乐的丰富经验之外，大跃进以来，有更多的音乐工作者打破了旧框框，直接地把曲艺作品作为自己的节目演出，也有些音乐工作者用曲艺的形式来进行创作。曲艺成为音乐大家庭中的当然的一员，一种极有特色的音乐体裁。音乐工作者在曲艺音乐的搜集、整理和研究方面也做了许多工作。还有些同志对曲艺的音乐进行了初步的研究。当然，这些工作绝不是音乐工作者单独的努力所能完成，而是依靠了曲艺工作者的共同努力才得以完成的。我们必须继续发展这种亲密合作关系，为曲艺音乐的革新和创造而共同努力。
