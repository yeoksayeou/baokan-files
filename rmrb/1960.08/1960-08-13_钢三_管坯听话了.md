    "Steel Three" Billet Obeys Orders

    "Steel Three" is a type of steel with a high carbon content and low elongation. When using this steel for seamless steel pipe billets, high temperatures and fast speeds can easily cause jams. In the past, when encountering this situation, workers at Anshan Seamless Steel Pipe Factory would lower the billet temperature and slow down the piercing machine to resolve it. This prevented rapid production increases. However, "Steel Three" seamless steel pipes are steel materials needed to support agriculture for tractors, irrigation equipment, and the like. So, how to solve this problem and produce more of this type of seamless steel pipe?

    Starting in August, the workers of the first shift – Class B of the hot rolling workshop – were determined to overcome this hurdle. Foreman Zhang Jintian convened a "flying meeting." Miao Hongzhen, the deputy secretary of the factory's Party committee, also participated in the meeting. After discussion, the workers believed that this problem could be solved by adjusting the piercing machine. In the past, some workers were afraid of damaging the machine and affecting production, so they dared not boldly adjust the piercing machine. Miao Hongzhen then encouraged and supported Zhang Guocui, the piercing machine team leader, to make adjustments. Based on everyone's suggestions for improving the operation of the piercing machine, Zhang Guocui moved the seamless steel pipe mandrel position forward a little, increasing the distance between the two rollers, thus reducing the pressing weight. After this adjustment, the billet passed through the piercing machine smoothly, and the trial rolling was immediately successful. The workers operated the piercing machine, using high speed to roll high-temperature billets, and seamless steel pipes flowed smoothly one after another. The seamless steel pipes rolled by the first shift exceeded the shift production plan by about ten percent. (Song Guangtian)

### “钢三”管坯听话了

    “钢三”管坯听话了
    “钢三”这种钢种含炭量高，伸延力小。用这种钢的管坯轧制无缝钢管，温度一高，转数一快，就容易卡住。过去，鞍钢无缝钢管厂工人碰到这种情况，就采取把管坯温度降低，把穿孔机转数放慢的办法来解决。产量不能很快增长。可是，“钢三”无缝钢管是支援农业作拖拉机、排灌设备等需要的钢材。怎样解决这个问题，多产这种无缝钢管呢？
    八月份开始的第一班——热轧车间乙班的工人，决心要攻下这一关。工长张金田召开了“飞行会”。厂党委副书记苗洪祯也参加了这个会。经过讨论，工人们认为，这一问题可以通过调整穿孔机来解决。过去有的工人怕弄坏机器影响生产，不敢大胆调整穿孔机。苗洪祯便鼓励和支持穿孔机组长张国翠去调整。张国翠根据大家关于改进穿孔机操作的意见，把无缝钢管顶头位置向前移动一点，使两个辊子的距离远一些，这样压下的重量就小了。经过这么一调整，管坯很顺利地通过穿孔机，一下子就试轧成功。工人们操纵着穿孔机，用高速度轧高温的管坯，一根根无缝钢管畅行如流，第一班轧出的无缝钢管就超过班产计划百分之十左右。（宋广田）
