Using the U.S.-Japan Treaty as a Tool for War Preparations
    The U.S. Vigorously Expands Air Force Bases in Japan
    According to a report by the "Asahi Shimbun" on the 24th, after the conclusion of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the U.S. military began reinforcing and expanding its air force bases in Misawa, Yokota, Itazuke, Atsugi, and Iwakuni, Japan.
    The newspaper said that the original 10,000-foot runway at Misawa Air Force Base was lengthened to 12,000 feet last month. With the extended runway, Misawa Air Force Base has now become one of the largest U.S. air force bases in Asia.
    The newspaper also said that the runway at Atsugi U.S. Air Force Base has also been lengthened. The U.S. military is planning to use approximately $3 million to expand and strengthen the U.S. Air Force Base. The "Asahi Shimbun" also said that after the conclusion of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the U.S. is also inducing the Japanese government to agree to its permanent use of the North Fuji Training Area to train the U.S. Marines recently deployed to Okinawa.

    利用日美条约作备战工具
    美国大肆扩建在日本的空军基地
    据“朝日新闻”24日报道　在新日美“安全条约”缔结之后，美国军队开始了它在日本的三泽、横田、板付、厚木和岩国的空军基地的加固和扩建工程。
    报纸说，三泽空军基地原有的一万英尺长的跑道已经在上个月加长到一万二千英尺。由于加长了跑道，现在三泽空军基地已经成为美国在亚洲最大的空军基地之一。
    这家报纸又说，厚木美国空军基地的跑道也已经加长。美国军队正打算用大约三百万美元来扩大和加强美国空军基地。“朝日新闻”还说，在缔结新日美“安全条约”之后，美国还正在诱使日本政府同意它永久使用北富士演习场，来训练最近派到冲绳岛的美国海军陆战队。
