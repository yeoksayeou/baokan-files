"Poor Stick" Song

Six hundred million "poor sticks," with great revolutionary ambition,
Fear neither wind nor rain,
Hold the red flag high and stride forward.
Cooperativization, communization,
Communism sprouts,
Marxism blossoms.
Imperialism gnashes its teeth,
Revisionism is furious.
Despite being "poor and blank,"
We weave a landscape like a painting.
The "poor stick" revolution spreads a good story,
The people's spirits are high.
Look at the world of tomorrow,
Whose will it be after all!
Lǐ Cūn

    “穷棒子”歌六亿“穷棒子”，革命志气大，不怕风来不怕雨，高举红旗往前跨。合作化，公社化，共产主义发芽，马克思主义开花。帝国主义咬牙，修正主义气炸。尽管“一穷二白”，织就江山如画。“穷棒子”革命传佳话，人民意气风发。请看明日世界，竟是谁家天下！
