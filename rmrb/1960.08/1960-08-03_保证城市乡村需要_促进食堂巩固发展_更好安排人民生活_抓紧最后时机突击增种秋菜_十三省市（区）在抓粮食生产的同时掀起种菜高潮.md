Xinhua News Agency report: A high tide of planting autumn vegetables has successively been launched in thirteen provinces, cities (and autonomous regions), including Liaoning, Beijing, Shanxi, Xinjiang, Gansu, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Sichuan, while grasping grain production.

    Liaoning Province has launched a "small autumn plowing" campaign, further setting off a high tide of planting autumn vegetables.

    The CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee specifically issued an urgent notice in mid-July on "vigorously carrying out the small autumn plowing campaign," calling on all localities to ensure the completion of the originally planned autumn vegetable planting area on the one hand, and to intensively plant vegetables using all available gaps on the other hand.

    The people in urban and rural areas of various localities enthusiastically responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee and launched the "small autumn plowing" campaign.

    After victoriously carrying out two major assault campaigns of rushing to plant and rush to hoe, the urban and rural people on the front line of agricultural production in the suburbs of Beijing are now launching the third assault campaign centered on planting cabbage on a large scale and strengthening field management of grain and vegetable fields.

    At present, the seven aspects required for planting cabbage, such as land, seeds, base fertilizer, water source, labor, transportation, and technology, have been basically implemented item by item in most counties and districts, and preparations for rushing to plant cabbage are being carried out intensely in the vast fields.

    A high tide of planting autumn vegetables has been launched in various parts of Shanxi Province. The vast number of commune members in the Jinan area seized the opportunity after the rain to intensively plant vegetables, and have now planted 880,000 mu. Women in the Jin Southeast area launched a campaign for everyone to plant ten vegetables and one hundred melons, using all available vacant land to intensively plant vegetables. Many women's vegetable ditches have appeared throughout the area.

    In the busy stage of summer harvesting and autumn field management, various parts of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region squeezed out some manpower and animal power to rush to sow autumn vegetables. In Urumqi, Yining, and other places with shorter frost-free periods, the sowing of autumn vegetables has entered a high tide.

    Expanding the planting area of ​​autumn vegetables is of particular importance in Xinjiang. The most prominent problem of vegetable seeds for rushing to plant autumn vegetables along the railway has been solved.

    Gansu Province mobilized all the people and launched a solid upsurge of rushing to plant autumn vegetables. In the first half of the year, Gansu Province carried out the "double hundred jin" campaign, with each person planting one hundred jin of pumpkins and one hundred jin of potatoes, increasing the planting of 890,000 mu of potatoes and melons and vegetables, which have been harvested one after another. On this basis, various parts of the province have planted autumn vegetables on a large scale. As of July 25, according to preliminary statistics from 28 counties and cities including Pingliang, Zhangye, Tianshui, and Linxia, ​​more than 557,000 mu of autumn vegetables have been sown as the main crop, and more than 967,000 mu of grain and vegetables have been intercropped.

    Since the beginning of July, various parts of Hunan Province have sown more than 1.19 million mu of various autumn vegetables such as radishes and cabbages. In addition to the summer vegetables originally planted, the province has an average of more than 0.15 mu of vegetable land per person.

    Since mid-June, various parts of Hunan have made specific arrangements for planting autumn vegetables. 90% of the counties in the province held on-site vegetable production meetings to summarize and exchange vegetable planting experience. 90% of the public canteens in the province have fixed vegetable planting teams.

    Various parts of Hubei actively rush to plant autumn vegetables. In Xiangyang Prefecture, which is progressing faster, more than 600,000 mu of various autumn vegetables have been planted. A vegetable planting boom has also begun to take shape in Huanggang, Jingzhou, Wuhan and other areas. The vegetables planted in Wuhan have increased by nearly one time compared with the same period last year.

    Adopting a variety of methods to expand the area of ​​autumn vegetables is the biggest feature of vegetable production in Hubei Province this year.

    While doing the "double rush" (rush harvesting and rush planting), various parts of Guangxi are actively rushing to plant autumn vegetables.

    Party committees at all levels attach great importance to autumn vegetable production and widely call on the masses to "plant multiple crops on one piece of land, plant all year round, and keep it green in all seasons." In the past month or so, people's communes, agencies, schools, and troops in various places have taken action.

    People's communes in various parts of Zhejiang Province are planting autumn vegetables in advance and strengthening the cultivation of summer vegetables, striving to turn the off-season into the peak season, and meet the needs of urban and rural people to eat vegetables in the autumn vegetable shortage season. As of mid-July, the province has used mulberry gardens, tea gardens, orchards, and "ten sides" to expand and interplant more than 2.4 million mu of various vegetables; the more than 620,000 mu of vegetable bases of public canteens in rural areas throughout the province have been universally sown; the vegetables on the more than 9,000 mu of vegetable bases in the province's twelve cities and industrial and mining areas are also generally better than last year.

    People's communes in various parts of Anhui Province have adopted the method of combining the establishment of specialized vegetable teams with mobilizing the masses to do it themselves to comprehensively carry out the sowing and field management of autumn vegetables.

    Since entering July, autumn vegetable production in Anhui Province has risen sharply. In just over 20 days, Bengbu, Fuyang, Hefei and other prefectures and cities rushed to plant more than 1.3 million mu of various autumn vegetables.

    Various parts of Fujian Province grasp vegetable production like grain production and greatly expand the planting of autumn vegetables. Up to now, the province has rushed to plant more than 1.16 million mu of vegetables and used sporadic gaps to plant more than 200 million melon plants. All localities have paid attention to ideological mobilization in the campaign to rush to plant autumn vegetables.

    The area of ​​spring and summer sown vegetables in Jiangxi Province has expanded by 69% compared with the same period last year.

    Now, a campaign to rush to plant vegetables is underway throughout the province. By the end of July, the suburbs of Nanchang City and Nanchang and Xinjian counties had planted more than 5,000 mu of various autumn vegetables. While concentrating major labor forces to rush to harvest early rice and rush to transplant late rice, the vast rural areas have arranged appropriate manpower to rush to plant autumn vegetables.

    Various parts of Sichuan are grasping both the intensive planting of autumn vegetables and the field management of summer vegetables, striving for high yields and more harvests of vegetables throughout the year.

    Grasping fast-maturing and high-yielding crops is the biggest feature of the current autumn vegetable production campaign in Sichuan Province. In planning autumn vegetable production, all localities generally focus on varieties with short maturity periods, long harvest periods, and high yields, and comprehensively arrange the planting plan of various vegetables according to the principle of "both coarse and fine vegetables."
