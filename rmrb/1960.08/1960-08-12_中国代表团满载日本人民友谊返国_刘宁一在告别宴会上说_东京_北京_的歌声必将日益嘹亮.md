Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Tokyo: The Chinese delegation, led by Liu Ningyi, that went to Japan to attend the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo)大会 (Taikai, assembly) and the Sixth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, left Japan on the morning of the 11th to return home.

Also departing from Tokyo with the delegation to return home was Zheng Senyu, representative of the World Peace Council.

Those seeing them off included: Ikuo Yasui, Akira Imamura, Akira Kazami, Gitaro Hiranuma, Toshio Tanaka, Riimi Hakamada, Chojuro Kawarasaki, Minoru Takano, Kazuo Suzuki and other leaders from all walks of life in Japan and workers, as well as overseas Chinese.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Tokyo: Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation attending the Sixth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament, delivered a speech at a farewell banquet.

He first thanked the Japanese friends for their warm reception. He said: Friends! Although two weeks is very short, we have had a very meaningful time. From the first minute we arrived at Haneda Airport, we were moved by your sincere and deep friendship. Almost every day and every place we were warmly welcomed, thoughtfully cared for, and warmly entertained by old friends, new friends, acquaintances and strangers. Many friends from all over Japan sent letters, telegrams and gifts, inviting us to visit them; many friends made a special trip from Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, Nagasaki, Nagano and other places to Tokyo to meet with us. These many touching examples show that the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, like the sea connecting the two countries, cannot be stopped.

He said: Due to the Japanese government's restrictions on the delegation's visit to Japan, the friendly wish of Japanese friends to extend the delegation's visit could not be realized, so that the delegation could not fully gather and talk with Japanese friends this time, especially not being able to accept the invitation of friends from other places to visit, which is regrettable. But we firmly believe that through this visit, the understanding and friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people have been further deepened.

Liu Ningyi said: Friends! Two weeks ago, we came to Tokyo with the friendship of the Chinese people, and tomorrow we will return to Beijing with the friendship of the Japanese people. We will hear the song of "Tokyo-Beijing" becoming louder and louder. We will see the flowers of friendship between Mount Tai and Mount Fuji blooming everywhere.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Tokyo: Approximately 500 Japanese public leaders attended the farewell banquet held by the Chinese delegation attending the Sixth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament, held tonight at the Tokyo Kaikan.

Those attending the banquet included Ikuo Yasui, Akira Iwai, Inejiro Asanuma, Sanzō Nosaka, Sunao Sonoda, Tetsu Katayama, Akira Kazami, Gitaro Hirano, Shigeru Nambara, Kumaichi Yamamoto, Chojuro Kawarasaki, Katsuiichirō Kamei, Eijun Ōtani and many other well-known figures from all walks of life in Japan.

Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation, spoke at the banquet, expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome given to the Chinese delegation by the Japanese people. (Speech to be issued separately)

Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, Ikuo Yasui, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, spoke on behalf of the Japanese guests at the banquet.

Asanuma said that when the Chinese representatives came to our country again after a long time, the Japanese people were overjoyed. "But you are about to return home a few days after your arrival." Asanuma said: "We regret this. We know this is because there are no normal diplomatic relations between the two countries." Asanuma emphasized: "We will do our best to make efforts to normalize relations with your country."

Ikuo Yasui said: "After two and a half years, receiving Chinese friends in our country, we feel as if we have received the support of 650 million people when we are engaged in fierce struggles." Ikuo Yasui said that he will strive to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China. Ikuo Yasui emphasized: "Establishing friendly relations with China will greatly contribute to the cause of world peace."

Akira Iwai pointed out that the friendship and unity between the Japanese and Chinese people will help consolidate world peace. Akira Iwai expressed the hope that the Chinese representatives will convey the warm greetings of the Japanese people to the Chinese people after returning home. The banquet ended with Liu Ningyi and Akira Iwai leading the crowd in shouting "Long live!"

Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Tokyo: Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, met with Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation visiting Japan, on the morning of the 10th. The talks were conducted in a very friendly atmosphere.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Tokyo: Seiichi Suzuki, head of the International Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), issued a statement at a press conference on the talks held on the morning of the 10th between the leaders of Sohyo and the Chinese representatives visiting Japan.

The statement said: "On the morning of August 10, Sohyo Chairman Kaoru Ota had breakfast with Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation visiting Japan. During the conversation at the table, Liu Ningyi invited Kaoru Ota to visit China. Kaoru Ota accepted the invitation and promised that he would like to visit China. The time for Kaoru Ota's visit has not yet been determined." The statement said: "Following the talks between Liu Ningyi and Kaoru Ota this morning, Sohyo Secretary-General Akira Iwai, Sohyo Vice-Chairman Akira Imamura, and Seiichi Suzuki held talks with Chinese delegation members Chen Yu and Sun Shengquan on the issue of mutual visits between Japan and China."

The statement said: "Sohyo leaders invited the leaders of the Chinese trade unions to visit Japan again after returning home from this visit. The Chinese side accepted this invitation. Both sides agreed that the exchange of films and other forms of cultural exchange should be promoted between Japan and China."

The statement said: "Both sides agreed that the unity between the workers of Asian and African countries must be further strengthened."

    中国代表团满载日本人民友谊返国
    刘宁一在告别宴会上说“东京—北京”的歌声必将日益嘹亮
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：由刘宁一率领前往日本参加日本工会总评议会大会和第六届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的中国代表团11日清晨离开日本返国。
    和代表团一起动身离开东京返国的还有世界和平理事会代表郑森禹。
    送行的有：安井郁、今村彰、风见章、平野义太郎、田中稔男、袴田里见、河原崎长十郎、高野实、铃木一雄等日本各界领袖和工人以及华侨等。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：出席第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的中国代表团团长刘宁一在告别宴会上致词。
    他首先感谢日本朋友的热情接待。他说：朋友们！两周的时间虽然很短，但是我们过得很有意义。从到达羽田机场的第一分钟起，我们就被你们的诚挚和深厚的友情所感动。几乎每一天、每一个场所都受到老朋友、新朋友、相识的或不相识的朋友们热烈的欢迎、周到的关怀和殷勤的款待。许多朋友从日本各个地方寄来书信、电报和礼品，邀请我们到他们那里去访问；许多朋友特意从京都、大阪、神户、长崎、长野等外地赶到东京和我们会见。这许多令人感动的事例说明，中日两国人民之间的友谊就像连接中日两国之间的海水一样，是挡也挡不住的。
    他说：由于日本政府对代表团访日期间的限制，日本朋友要求延长代表团访日期限的友好愿望没有能够实现，以至代表团这次不能够和日本朋友充分地欢聚和畅谈，特别是没有能够应外地朋友的邀请前去访问，这是令人遗憾的。但是我们深信，通过这次访问已经进一步加深了中日两国人民的理解和友好关系。
    刘宁一说：朋友们！两星期以前，我们带着中国人民的友谊到东京来，明天，我们又将带着日本人民的友谊回北京去。我们将听到“东京—北京”的歌声越来越嘹亮。我们将看到泰山和富士山之间的友谊花朵到处盛开。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：大约有五百名日本公众领袖出席了参加第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的中国代表团今晚在东京会馆举行的告别宴会。

    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎，日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁和日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章在宴会上代表日本来宾讲话。
    浅沼说，当中国代表们隔了很久重来我国的时候，日本人民欢欣若狂。“可是你们在到来后过了不多几天即将回国。”浅沼说：“我们对此感到遗憾。我们知道这是因为在两国之间没有正常的外交关系。”浅沼强调指出：“我们将竭尽所能作出努力争取同贵国的关系正常化”。
    安井郁说：“经过两年半的时间之后在我们国家接待中国朋友们，我们感觉到好像当我们从事激烈的斗争时，我们得到了六亿五千万人的增援。”安井郁表示他将努力使日中两国的外交关系得到恢复。安井郁强调说：“建立同中国的友好关系，我们就能大大有助于世界和平事业。”
    岩井章指出，日中两国人民的友好和团结，将有助于巩固世界和平。岩井章表示希望，中国代表们在回国后，向中国人民转达日本人民的热烈问候。宴会在刘宁一和岩井章带头高呼“万岁”声中结束。
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎10日上午同正在日本访问的中国代表团团长刘宁一会晤。会谈在非常友好的气氛中进行。
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会国际部负责人铃木诚市10日下午在记者招待会上就“总评”领导人和访问日本的中国代表于10日上午举行的会谈发表声明。
