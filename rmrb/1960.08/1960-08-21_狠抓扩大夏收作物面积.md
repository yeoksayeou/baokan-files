Vigorously Grasp the Expansion of Summer Harvest Crop Area
Wang Yanchun, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

This year, the area of summer harvest crops in our province is larger than any previous year, and the total grain output is also the highest ever. The fact of the bumper harvest further encourages us, makes us more aware of the great significance of the summer harvest season, more deeply understand the correctness of the "plant more, harvest more" policy, and more determined to vigorously grasp summer harvest crops.

Summer Harvest Crops Have Relatively Stable Harvests

The masses say, "Summer harvest, summer harvest, if you plant, you will harvest." There are relatively few droughts and floods in winter and spring each year, so the harvest of summer harvest crops is relatively stable. This has been the case throughout the years. Taking grain crops as an example, in 1952, a year of severe drought, the yield per unit area of ​​grain crops throughout the year decreased by 10.2% compared with the previous year, while summer harvest grain crops only decreased by 1.8%; in 1958, summer harvest crops encountered what can be said to be relatively many disasters. The sowing period was affected by drought, and the growing period had a lot of rain, but because drought resistance and flood prevention were done well, a bumper harvest was still achieved, with the yield per unit area increasing by 17% and the total output increasing by 18% compared with the previous year.

Some comrades believe that summer harvest grain does not account for a large proportion of the total annual grain output, and whether you plant more or less, plant well or badly, does not affect the overall situation. This view is completely wrong. In recent years, summer harvest grain in our province generally accounts for about 20% of the total annual grain output. Is 20% a small proportion? For this part of the grain that we are relatively confident of getting, what reason do we have not to actively take it. Moreover, the potential for increasing the yield of summer harvest grain crops is particularly large, especially in rice-producing areas where summer harvest crops are planted relatively less. The Jingzhou Special District harvested more summer harvest crops this year than in any previous year, but the sown area only accounts for about one-third of the total cultivated land area, and the situation in other paddy field areas is roughly the same. If these places expand the area of ​​summer harvest grain crops to account for 70% or 80% of the cultivated land area, and further refine cultivation, strengthen cultivation and management, how much would this increase production? What reason do we have not to vigorously tap this relatively easy-to-mine potential. Experience has proved that we must attach great importance to summer harvest crops, and planting more summer harvest crops should be regarded as a strategic measure for the whole year's production. If the first shot of the summer harvest is fired successfully, it will have a particularly important significance for boosting combat morale, promoting the autumn harvest, and realizing the leap forward throughout the year.

The problem lies in whether there is sufficient understanding of the great significance of improving the summer harvest season, and whether summer harvest crops are valued. The facts are very clear. Wherever summer harvest crops are regarded as an important season, the area is actively expanded, and planting, management, and harvesting are done carefully, the total output will increase year by year. Wherever it is thought that summer harvest crops are not a big deal, summer harvest crops are looked down upon, a little is planted casually, and once planted, they are ignored, left to fate, harvested if they grow well, and discarded if they don't grow well, the annual increase in production in such places is not much, and the output fluctuates up and down, even decreasing year after year. Therefore, the first thing to solve is the problem of ideological understanding. If ideology is not improved, output cannot be increased.

Everywhere Can Be Planted
Everywhere Can Achieve High Yields

Some comrades, due to the influence of traditional habits, on the one hand, look down on summer harvest crops, and on the other hand, have many superstitions about developing summer harvest crops, such as paddy fields being afraid of waterlogging, drylands being afraid of drought, and mountainous areas being afraid of cold... there are many taboos. However, the facts in the Great Leap Forward in recent years, especially the fact that summer harvest crops had a bumper harvest this year, have completely broken these superstitions.

The Jianghan Plain has many lakes and swamps, a lot of spring rain, and a high groundwater level. Can summer harvest crops be developed? The Jingzhou Special District answered this question with facts. This year, the summer harvest area in this special district has expanded from more than four million mu last year to more than seven million mu, and the total output has increased by nearly 100%. Large areas of paddy fields, lake swamps, and low-lying flood diversion areas can all be planted with summer harvest crops, and the harvests are very good.

Can summer harvest crops be developed in barren drylands? Wheat in large areas of dryland in the Xiangyang Special District has achieved bumper harvests year after year. The "Sanbei" (i.e., the north of Zaoyang, Xiangyang, and Guanghua counties) dryland, which is four hundred miles long, is the place that people call "a knife when it's sunny, and a mess when it rains". In 1959, the 1.52 million mu of wheat here achieved an average yield of 213 jin. This year, the wheat yield in the dryland of Zaoyang County has mostly caught up with the plain areas, and some have even exceeded the plain areas.

Can summer harvest crops be developed in mountainous areas? The facts tell us that summer harvest crops can not only go up the mountains, but also up the high mountains. In mountainous areas above 1,000 meters above sea level, it is also possible to win a bumper harvest of summer harvest crops. Zigui County is a large mountainous area. This year, the area of ​​summer harvest grain crops in the county has more than doubled compared with last year, and the total output has increased by nearly two times. After the summer harvest last year, it was still necessary to supply 9.85 million jin of grain here. This year, it is already self-sufficient and has a surplus. The Yanglin Commune in the county planted 760 mu of wheat at an altitude of 1,400 meters, with an average yield of 200 jin. The Baoshan Commune in Yun County planted 850 mu of wheat on high mountains at an altitude of 1,800 meters, with an average yield of more than 100 jin.

Can newly reclaimed wasteland be planted with wheat? Is there any harvest after planting? This year, the newly reclaimed wasteland in many areas has achieved bumper harvests, and the fact that the wasteland yield has caught up with or even exceeded that of cultivated land is everywhere. Last year, the Caodian Commune in Huangpi County reclaimed 60,000 mu of wasteland, with an average wheat yield of about 200 jin. Seventy-nine barren hills have become wheat-producing hills. The Minsheng Production Team in this commune reclaimed 8,000 mu of barren lake fields, with an average wheat yield of about 300 jin. Last year, the Duobao Commune in Tianmen County reclaimed and planted 7,300 mu of wheat on the Han River beach, with an average yield of more than 200 jin.

In short, in terms of the natural conditions in our province, except for a very few areas, summer harvest crops can be planted, and high yields can be achieved everywhere. The key to the decision lies in people. As long as we are willing to plant more, and plant well, manage well, and harvest well, we can greatly increase production and achieve a bumper harvest. Any emphasis on special conditions, failure to vigorously develop summer harvest crops, and the belief that summer harvest crops have low yields and small harvests are inconsistent with the actual situation.

Expanding the Area Has Great Significance

In order to ensure a large increase in the total output of summer harvest crops, the most important thing is to conscientiously implement the policy of combining planting more and harvesting more with high yield and harvesting more. On the one hand, we must strive to expand the sown area; on the other hand, we must adhere to the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, carry out a large-scale balanced increase in production, and increase the yield per unit area. As a long-term policy, increasing production mainly depends on increasing the yield per unit area, because expanding the area is always limited. At any time, we must strive to improve the level of cultivation and field management, and strive to achieve a large-scale balanced increase in production. However, at present, at least in the next few years, because the potential for expanding the cultivated land area is very large, expanding the area has great strategic significance, and expanding the area has a paramount role in increasing the total output. Everyone knows that from the perspective of the entire province, it is not bad if the yield per unit area can increase by 10% each year; and if at the same time we seize the expansion of the cultivated land area, it is possible to increase production by tens of percent or even more each year. This year, some special districts, some counties and communes, have doubled the total output of summer harvest grain, precisely because they have seized the expansion of the area. Some counties have carefully calculated the accounts, and 70% to 80% of the increased grain comes from expanding the area. From the perspective of the entire province, if we expand 10 million mu of summer harvest crops, and harvest 200 jin of wheat per mu, the total output can increase by 2 billion jin. In the summer harvest of 1959, we had a particularly profound lesson. Because we planted less summer harvest crops, the total output was much less than in 1958. Under the current conditions, due to certain natural conditions and technical levels, and because there are not many chemical fertilizers and agricultural machinery, the annual increase in yield per unit area is limited to a certain extent; to harvest more, we must first plant more, and seize the expansion of the area. With a relatively large area, coupled with a large-scale balanced increase in production, we can achieve the goal of harvesting more and increasing the total output. Therefore, from the perspective of the entire province, vigorously grasping the expansion of the summer harvest crop area should be regarded as a strategic measure for increasing production in the next few years.

Can the Area Be Expanded?

In our province, there is great potential for expanding the area of ​​summer harvest crops, whether it is plains, hills, mountainous areas, or lake areas.

First, there is wasteland that can be reclaimed. There is a lot of wasteland in our province. There are barren slopes and barren hills in mountainous and hilly areas, and lake wasteland and river beaches in plains and lake areas. It is very suitable to reclaim these barren slopes, barren hills, barren fields, and barren beaches and plant them with wheat, broad beans, and rapeseed. Especially river beaches and lake wastelands, planting a season of wheat or rapeseed every year, the cost is not high, but the harvest is very reliable, which is the most worthwhile.

Second, the multiple cropping can be increased. In recent years, the autumn planting area in the province has only accounted for about 60% of the cultivated land area, and in some paddy field areas and mountainous areas, it only accounts for 30% or 40%, and most of the fields are left unplanted. This part of the unused winter fallow fields, except for a few cold-soaked fields, rotten mud fields, low-lying waterlogged land, and some places in the high mountains, can all develop summer harvest crops.

By seizing these two points, it is entirely possible to strive to expand the autumn planting area in the province by about 30% compared with last year. And it is also possible for some counties and communes to strive to expand by 50% or even more.

Solve Contradictions and Move Forward Boldly

After the cultivated land area is expanded, can it be planted? Is there enough labor? This is the question that everyone is most worried about. First of all, we must see that after the cultivated land area is expanded, it will not necessarily increase the labor tension. It is called labor tension when each laborer has an average of ten mu, fifteen mu, or twenty mu of land. It is also called labor tension when each laborer has an average of only one mu, eight fen, or even only six fen of land. It can be seen that this is not simply a labor problem, but more importantly, an arrangement problem. According to Zaoyang County (where each laborer has an average of 25 mu of cultivated land) and the experience of some other places, the more cultivated land there is, the easier it is to arrange stubble fields, to implement rotation, to better stagger seasons, and to stagger work, which is conducive to overcoming the excessive concentration of labor during the busy farming season. For example, in places where there is more cultivated land, newly reclaimed wasteland can only be planted with one season of wheat, planting one season and resting one season. For this part of the land, we can use the gaps to plow the land, dry the soil, and send fertilizer as early as possible, so that we can sow in time when the season arrives, which can avoid the excessive concentration of work during autumn planting. In addition, there are many types of summer harvest crops, and the sowing and maturity periods are different. As long as they are arranged reasonably, the work can also be staggered. For example, compared with barley, broad beans, peas, and wheat, they are early-sown and early-maturing crops. However, in the past, because everyone looked down on these crops, they were planted less and planted late, and they were always planted after the wheat was planted. As a result, they matured late and were often harvested together with wheat, and the yield was very low. In recent years, the Xiangyang Special District has gradually changed this practice. On the one hand, the sown area of ​​these crops has been expanded, and on the other hand, the sowing period has been advanced. These crops have been planted half a month before wheat sowing. As a result, not only has the work of autumn planting and summer harvest been effectively staggered, but also the yield has been greatly increased. What needs to be seen in particular is that although the current agricultural labor force is relatively tight, the potential is also very large. The experience of many places has proved that through reforming tools, improving labor organization, and strengthening the production responsibility system, work efficiency can be greatly improved. Generally speaking, we have not done enough in this regard, and there is still great potential to be tapped. Obviously, the labor problem is not an insurmountable obstacle to expanding cultivated land and increasing the area of ​​summer harvest crops. The problem is to arrange it properly, tap potential from all aspects, and actively improve work efficiency.

There is also a certain contradiction between expanding the area of ​​summer harvest crops and the production in the next season, which is mainly a contradiction in stubble fields, that is, how to ensure that the next season of planting rice, cotton, and miscellaneous grains is not delayed. The solution to this problem is to make comprehensive arrangements for the crops throughout the year, implement a reasonable combination, and achieve a double bumper harvest of rice and wheat, a double bumper harvest of cotton and wheat, and a double bumper harvest of miscellaneous grains and wheat. Generally speaking, early rice fields and some middle rice fields should be planted with early-maturing summer harvest crops, such as early rice fields planted with March Yellow barley, early rapeseed, and red clover seeds, and middle rice fields planted with some barley and some wheat. Wheat can be planted in one season of late rice fields. If cotton and miscellaneous grains need to be intercropped in the wheat rows, the wheat should be sown in wide rows, and the width of the wheat rows should be determined according to the row spacing requirements for planting cotton and miscellaneous grains.

Plan Early, Prepare Early

Grasping early is very important for autumn planting, especially when it is required to greatly expand the area, it is more necessary to brew early, plan early, and prepare early. This requires learning to grasp with both hands, one hand grasping this year, and the other hand grasping next year. On the premise of grasping the current field management, we must start grasping the preparations for autumn planting.

A plan should be made early. How much area should be expanded? Where does this area come from? How should various crops be arranged? How to connect with the stubble fields in the next season? And so on, all need to be planned early and arranged properly, so as to start early.

Three guarantees should be grasped early. Now, the three-guarantee plan for autumn planting and the whole year of next year should be determined, guaranteeing the total output, guaranteeing it once, and implementing it to the team. New reclamation land does not guarantee production in the first year, and 30% of its income is turned over to the production team, and 70% belongs to the team. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of the masses be more fully exerted, which is conducive to preparing in advance; it is conducive to reclaiming wasteland, expanding the area, and increasing the total output.

Wasteland reclamation should be grasped early. Before mid-September, the wasteland should be reclaimed, and early reclamation and early soil drying are the most important experience for increasing production in newly reclaimed wasteland. The reason why many newly reclaimed wasteland this year can achieve high yields is because they were grasped early last year, and the wasteland was reclaimed in July and August. After a long period of soil drying, the fertility of the land was enhanced. Now, grasping wasteland reclamation is a great opportunity. We can use the free cattle and combine wasteland reclamation with grazing. It is entirely possible to reclaim half a mu of land every day for each cow, half a day for wasteland reclamation and half a day for rest. If a special district can draw out 100,000 or 200,000 cattle, it can reclaim 50,000 mu or 100,000 mu of wasteland in one day. Therefore, do not let the cattle idle all day long now. Each commune and production team should draw out some strong cattle, with special cattle and special people, and work on it for a month or two, and a large amount of wasteland can be reclaimed.

Fertilizer should be grasped early. If the area is expanded, the key to whether planting more can harvest more is fertilizer. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to accumulate fertilizer in advance. The main way to solve this problem is to make green manure. Now is the time when vegetation is lush, and some labor can also be drawn out. Each production team and production team organizes a special team, relying on mountains in mountainous areas, relying on lakes in lake areas, and finding ways in plains, and fighting for two months or three months, and they will definitely be able to accumulate a lot of fertilizer. If this opportunity is missed, it will be too late to grab fertilizer in winter when the grass withers and the leaves fall.

In addition, the seeds, deep ploughing strip sowing tools, etc. required for expanding the cultivated land area must also be prepared as soon as possible. Everything must be grasped early and strive for the initiative.

    狠抓扩大夏收作物面积
    中共湖北省委书记处书记　王延春
    今年我省夏收作物的面积，比以往任何一年都大，粮食总产量也是历来最多的。丰收的事实进一步鼓舞了我们，使我们更加认识了夏收这一季的重大意义，更加深刻地体会到“多种多收”这一方针的正确性，更加有决心去大抓夏收作物。
    夏收作物收成比较稳定
    群众说：“夏收夏收，有种就有收”。每年冬春水旱灾害比较少，因而夏收作物的收成就比较稳定。历年来的情况都是如此，拿粮食作物说，大旱灾的1952年，全年粮食作物的单产比上一年减少10.2％，而夏收粮食作物只减少1.8％；1958年夏收作物所遇到的灾害，可以说是比较多的，播种期受旱，生长期多雨，但是由于抗旱防涝搞得好，仍然获得了大丰收，单产比前一年增加17％，总产量增加18％。
    有些同志认为，夏收粮食在全年粮食总产量中所占的分量不大，种多种少，种好种坏，无关大局。这种看法是完全错误的。历年来我省夏收粮食，一般的占全年粮食总产量的20％左右。20％这个比例还算小吗？对于这一部分比较有把握拿到手的粮食，我们有什么理由不积极去拿。而且，夏收粮食作物的增产潜力是特别大的，尤其是夏收作物播种比较少的水稻产区。荆州专区今年夏收作物比以往任何一年都收的多，但是播种面积也只占总耕地面积的三分之一左右，其它水田地区的情况大体也是如此。像这些地方如果把夏收粮食作物的面积扩大到占耕地面积的70％或者80％，并且进一步精耕细作，加强培育管理，这该增产多少？对于这种比较容易挖掘的潜力，我们有什么理由不大力去挖掘。经验证明，必须十分重视夏收作物，多种夏收作物应当作为全年生产的一个战略性的措施来看待。夏收这一炮打得响，对鼓舞战斗情绪，促进秋季丰收，实现全年跃进，具有特别重要的意义。
    问题就在于对提高夏收这一季的重大意义是否有足够的认识，是否把夏收作物放在眼里。事实十分清楚，凡是把夏收作物当作重要的一季来抓，积极扩大面积，认真种好管好收好，总产量就年年上升。凡是认为夏收作物来头不大，看不起夏收作物，马马虎虎地种一点，种下去就不管了，听天由命，长好就收，长不好就丢，这样的地方，每年增产就不多，产量忽上忽下，甚至连年减产。所以，首先要解决思想认识问题，思想不提高，产量就不可能增加。
  到处可以种
  到处能高产
    有些同志由于受传统习惯的影响，一方面看不起夏收作物，另一方面对发展夏收作物又有很多的迷信，什么水田怕渍，岗地怕旱，山区怕冷……禁忌多得很。但是，最近几年来大跃进中的事实，尤其是今年夏收作物大丰收的事实，彻底破除了这些迷信。
    江汉平原湖沼多，春雨多，地下水位高，能不能发展夏收作物？荆州专区用事实回答了这个问题。今年，这个专区的夏收面积，由去年的四百多万亩扩大到七百多万亩，总产量增加将近一倍，大面积的水田、湖沼地以及低洼的分洪区，都能种夏收作物，收成都很好。
    土地瘠薄的岗地能不能发展夏收作物？襄阳专区大面积的岗地小麦，连年获得大丰收。长达四百华里的“三北”（即枣阳、襄阳、光化三县之北）岗地，就是人们所说的“天晴一把刀，下雨一团糟”的地方，1959年这里的一百五十二万亩小麦，平均单产达到二百一十三斤。今年枣阳县岗地小麦产量，大部分赶上了平原地区，有的甚至超过了平原地区。
    山区能不能发展夏收作物？事实告诉我们，夏收作物不但能上山，而且能上大高山。在海拔千米以上的山地，同样能够夺得夏收作物的大丰收。秭归县就是大山区，今年全县夏收粮食作物面积比去年扩大一倍多，总产量增加将近两倍。去年夏收后，这里还需要供应九百八十五万斤粮食，今年已经自给有余了。该县杨林公社在海拔一千四百米的地方种了七百六十亩小麦，平均单产达到二百斤。郧县鲍山公社在海拔一千八百米的高山上种的八百五十亩小麦，平均单产达到一百多斤。
    新开荒地能不能种小麦？种下去有没有收？今年许多地区的新开荒地大都取得丰收，荒地产量赶上甚至超过了熟地的事实，到处都有。黄陂县槽店公社去年开荒六万亩，小麦平均单产在二百斤左右，有七十九个荒岗变成了小麦丰产岗；这个公社的民生生产队，新开垦的八千亩荒湖田，小麦平均单产达到三百来斤。天门县多宝公社去年在汉江河滩上开荒播种了七千三百亩小麦，平均单产达到二百多斤。
    总之，就我省自然条件来说，除极少数地区以外，都可以种夏收作物，而且到处能高产。决定的关键在于人。只要我们肯多种，并且种好管好收好，就能够大增产、大丰收。任何强调条件特殊，不能大力发展夏收作物，以及认为夏收作物产量低，收成不大，都是不符合实际情况的。
    扩大面积有重大意义
    为了保证夏收作物总产量的大大增加，最主要的是要认真执行多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针。一方面要努力扩大播种面积；一方面要坚持执行农业“八字宪法”，开展大面积平衡增产，提高单位面积产量。作为长远的方针来说，增产主要靠提高单位面积产量，因为扩大面积总是有限的，任何时候，都必须努力提高耕作水平和田间管理水平，力求实现大面积平衡增产。但是，在当前，起码是最近几年内，由于扩大耕地面积潜力很大，扩大面积有重大的战略意义，扩大面积对增加总产量有头等重要的作用。大家知道，从全省来说，单位面积产量每年能提高10％就算不坏了；而如果同时抓住扩大耕地面积，每年增产百分之几十甚至更多，都是可能的。今年有些专区，有些县和公社，夏收粮食总产量成倍地增长，正是因为他们狠狠地抓住了扩大面积这一着。有些县仔细地算了账，在增产的粮食中，70％乃至80％是靠扩大面积得来的。就全省来说，如果扩大一千万亩的夏收作物，每亩收二百斤小麦，总产量就能增加二十亿斤。1959年夏收，我们有过特别深刻的教训，由于少种了夏收作物，总产量就比1958年减少了很多。在目前条件下，由于受一定的自然条件和技术水平的限制，由于化学肥料和农业机械还不多，因而每年单位面积产量的提高受到了一定的限制；要多收，首先要多种，抓住扩大面积。有了比较多的面积，再加上大面积平衡增产，才能达到多收、增加总产量的目的。因此，从全省来说，狠抓扩大夏收作物面积，应当作为几年内增产的战略措施。
      能不能扩大面积？
    我省扩大夏收作物面积，不论是平原、丘陵、山区、湖区，都有很大的潜力。
    第一，有荒地可以开。我省荒地很多，山区、丘陵有荒坡、荒岗，平原，湖区有湖荒、河滩，把这些荒坡、荒岗、荒田、荒滩开出来，种上麦子、蚕豆和油菜，都很合适。尤其是河滩、湖荒，每年种上一季小麦或油菜，工本不大，收成却很保险，是最划得来的。
    第二，可以增加复种。历年来全省秋种面积只占耕地面积的60％左右，某些水田地区和山区只占30％或40％，大部分田空着不种。这一部分没有利用的冬闲田，除了少数的冷浸田、烂泥田、低涝地和大高山的某些地方而外，都可以发展夏收作物。
    抓住这两条，争取今年全省秋种面积比去年扩大30％左右，是完全可能的。而有些县和公社争取扩大50％甚至更多，也是可能的。
    解决矛盾　大胆前进
    耕地面积扩大后，能不能种得来？劳动力够不够？这是大家最耽心的一个问题。首先要看到，耕地面积扩大以后，不一定会增加劳动力的紧张程度。每个劳动力平均有十亩地、十五亩地、二十亩地的叫劳动力紧张，每个劳动力平均只有一亩地、八分地、甚至只有六分地的也叫劳动力紧张，可见，这不单纯是个劳动力问题，更主要的是个安排问题。根据枣阳县
  （该县耕地多的地方，每个劳动力平均有二十五亩）和其他一些地方的经验，耕地越多，越便于安排茬口，便于实行轮作，能更好地错开季节，错开活路，反而有利于克服农忙时劳动力的过分集中。比如，在耕地比较多的地方，新开荒地就可以只种一季小麦，种一季歇一季，对这部分地，就可以利用空隙，尽早犁地、炕土、送肥，等季节一到就可以及时播种，这就可以避免秋种时活路的过分集中。此外，夏收作物的种类很多，播种期和成熟期有先有后，只要合理地安排，也可以错开活路。比如，大麦、蚕豆、豌豆和小麦比较，是早播早熟作物，但是过去由于大家看不起这些作物，种的少，种的迟，总是在种完小麦后才种，结果熟的也就迟，往往和小麦挤在一起收，并且产量很低。几年来，襄阳专区逐步地改变了这种作法。一方面扩大了这些作物的播种面积，另一方面又提前了播种期，在小麦播种前半个月就把这些作物种上了，结果不但有效地错开了秋种和夏收的活路，而且产量也大大地提高了。尤其要看到的是，当前农业劳动力虽然比较紧张，但是潜力也大得很。许多地方的经验证明，通过改革工具，改善劳动组织和加强生产责任制，工效就可以大大地提高。一般说，在这方面我们还抓的很不够，还大有潜力可挖。显然，劳动力的问题并不是扩大耕地、增加夏收作物面积的一个不可克服的障碍，问题是要妥善地安排，从各方面挖掘潜力，积极提高工效。
    扩大夏收作物面积和下一季的生产也有一定的矛盾，这主要是茬口上的矛盾，就是如何做到不耽误下一季种水稻、棉花、杂粮的问题。解决这个问题的办法是：将全年作物作出全面的安排，实行合理搭配，做到水稻、麦子双丰收，棉花、麦子双丰收，杂粮、麦子双丰收。一般地说，早稻田和一部分中稻田应当种早熟的夏收作物，比如早稻田种三月黄大麦、早油菜、红花草籽，中稻田种一部分大麦、种一部分小麦，一季晚稻田可以都种小麦。棉花和杂粮需要在麦行里套种的，麦子就应当实行宽行条播，按照棉花、杂粮播种行距的要求，来决定麦行的宽度。
        早规划　早准备
    抓早，对于秋种来说非常重要，尤其是在要求大量扩大面积的情况下，更需要早酝酿、早规划、早准备。这就必须要学会两手抓，一手抓今年，一手抓明年。在抓好当前田间管理的前提下，要着手抓秋种的各项准备工作。
    要早作规划。扩大多少面积？这些面积从哪里来？各种作物如何安排？如何和下一季的茬口相衔接？等等，都需要早规划，妥善安排，以便于及早动手。
    要早抓三包。现在就把秋种和明年全年的三包方案定下来，包总产、一次包定，落实到小队。新开荒地第一年不包产，其收益30％上交生产队，70％归小队。只有如此，才能更充分地发挥群众的积极性，有利于提前做好准备工作；有利于开荒，扩大面积，增加总产量。
    要早抓开荒。9月中旬以前，就要把荒地开出来，早开早炕土，这是新开荒地增产的最重要的经验。今年许多新开荒地所以能获得高产，都是由于去年抓得早，7、8月间就开荒，经过长时间的炕土，从而增强了土地的肥力。现在，抓开荒正是大好时机，可以利用牛闲，把开荒和放牧结合起来，半天开荒、半天休息，每天每头牛开半亩地，是完全可以办到的。如果一个专区能抽出十万、二十万头牛来，一天就可以开荒五万亩、十万亩。所以，现在不要让耕牛整天闲着。每个公社、生产队把强壮的耕牛抽出一部分，专牛专人，连着干它一个月、两个月，就可以开出大量的荒地来。
    要早抓肥料。面积扩大了，多种能不能多收，肥料是个关键问题。所以，特别需要提前积肥。解决这个问题的主要办法是打青沤肥。现在正是草木茂盛的时候，劳动力也可以抽一部分出来，每个生产队、生产小队组织专门班子，山区靠山、湖区靠湖、平原找平原的门路，大战两个月、三个月，就一定能积到大量的肥料。错过这个时机，到了冬天，草枯叶落，再来抓肥料，已经迟了。
    此外，扩大耕地面积所需要的种子、深耕条播工具等，也都要及早准备。一切都要抓早，争取主动。
