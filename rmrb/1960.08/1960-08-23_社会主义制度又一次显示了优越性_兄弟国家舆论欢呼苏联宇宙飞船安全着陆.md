    Socialist System Shows Superiority Once Again
    Brotherly Countries' Public Opinion Cheers the Safe Landing of the Soviet Spaceship
    Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd – The remarkable achievements of the Soviet Union in successfully launching its second satellite-spaceship and the safe return of the ship to Earth have been greeted with enthusiastic cheers in various socialist countries in the past two days.
    The editorial of the Korean "Rodong Sinmun" believes that this is a great victory for Soviet science. The newspaper wrote: The dream of human space flight has been transformed into reality by the achievements of the Soviet Union. This is a great manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. The achievement of the Soviet Union is the pride of the people of all socialist countries, and it inspires and encourages all oppressed people and peace-loving people around the world.
    The "Nhan Dan" newspaper of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam published an editorial saying that Soviet science has once again made an extremely great contribution to the people of the world. Socialism and communism have broken all shackles on science and given science wings, thus further demonstrating its superiority.
    D. Dambynzüren, a famous Mongolian scientist and poet, said that the problem of the spaceship and the animals inside it returning to Earth has been solved by Soviet scientists. Now there is a real possibility of humans flying into outer space.
    The Albanian "Zeri i Popullit" published an editorial pointing out that the successful launch of the Soviet second spaceship clearly proves that Soviet science and technology are undeniably superior to American science and technology. The editorial said that this achievement is a new and valuable contribution to the world's scientific treasure.
    The Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo" said in an editorial article: This is another victory for the great socialist country, for the socialist system. The great achievements made by the Soviet Union in science and technology cannot be achieved by capitalist countries. The article pointed out that, in contrast to the Soviet Union, American imperialists and militarists use the great achievements of human genius for aggressive purposes—preparing for new wars.
    The Czechoslovak "Rude Pravo," in a commentary on the return of the spaceship to Earth, wrote: "...The road to human flight to the universe has been opened. How much heroic and selfless labor has been put in by the Soviets for this!" The newspaper said that this victory demonstrates the creative ability of free people and is a new victory for communism.
    A commentary in the German Democratic Republic's "Neues Deutschland" said that in less than three years since the launch of the first artificial satellite, Soviet scientists, technicians, and workers have opened the door to the universe. The people of the German Democratic Republic enthusiastically cheer for the great achievements of the Soviet Union.
    The Polish "Życie Warszawy" wrote that the fact that the spaceship launched by the Soviet Union was able to return to Earth smoothly with healthy "passengers" is a great achievement of Soviet science. At the same time, its landing accuracy is an unprecedented record in world rocket technology.
    The achievements of the Soviet Union in launching its second spaceship have also aroused widespread repercussions in Hungary and Romania.
