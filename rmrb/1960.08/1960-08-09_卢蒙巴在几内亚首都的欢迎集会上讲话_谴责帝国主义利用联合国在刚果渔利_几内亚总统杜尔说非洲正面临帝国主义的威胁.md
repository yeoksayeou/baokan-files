Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, 7th -- Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, speaking at a rally held in Conakry on the evening of the 6th to welcome him, emphasized that the attempt by imperialism to profit in the Congo through the United Nations is certain to fail. He expressed his firm belief that the forces seeking liberation and independence will overwhelm the forces of oppression.

Lumumba also spoke about the Congolese government's foreign policy of active neutrality.

Guinean President Sékou Touré also spoke at the rally, saying that the events in the Congo are a struggle between justice and injustice, a struggle between the Congolese people's demand for independence and freedom and the imperialism that seeks to maintain its rule. He stressed that the United Nations is now facing a severe test, and if it does not support the just demands of the Congolese people, it will completely lose its credibility. He also emphasized that African problems should be solved by Africans. He said that Africa is facing a threat from imperialism. He also pointed out that the era in which imperialism could do whatever it wanted is gone forever.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 7th -- According to a report from the Middle East News Agency from Khartoum: Sudanese Foreign Minister Ahmed Kheir revealed that Sudan's view on the Congo issue is that African independent countries should hold a foreign ministers' level meeting in the Congolese capital, Leopoldville, to discuss measures to be taken to safeguard the independence and unity of the Congo, including military intervention.

The Foreign Minister informed the ambassadors of the United Arab Republic, Tunisia, Ghana, and Ethiopia to Khartoum today that Ghanaian President Nkrumah had sent a telegram to Sudanese Prime Minister Abboud requesting Sudanese armed forces to intervene in the Congo outside the scope of the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th -- New York dispatch: The American bourgeois press continues to advocate using the United Nations to achieve American neo-colonial rule over the Congo and even other African countries.

The "Washington Post" blatantly revealed the ambition of the United States to control Africa under the banner of the United Nations in an editorial on the 5th entitled "Prospects for Africa." It emphasized that the "retreat" of the old colonial countries had "created an enticing power vacuum" in Africa, which is the best opportunity for the United States to export capital to Africa and seize power. The newspaper said: "The Congo experience shows" that "a plan through the United Nations is the only feasible" solution. It advocated that the U.S. government should seize the current opportunity to "timely" determine "long-term policies" and "plans" to penetrate Africa with "more significant and broader efforts."

The mouthpiece of American monopoly capitalists, "The Wall Street Journal," published an editorial on the 4th, smearing the Congolese people for "lacking the ability to be independent." It clamored that "until the Congolese can more effectively take care of themselves, the best way is to let them continue as wards of the United Nations." It said: The United States is now doing "a very important thing regarding self-interest" in the Congo.

The "New York Times" published a letter on the 7th from Livingston, a former U.S. diplomat to Africa, openly advocating that the Congo should be "trusteed" by the United Nations for at least ten years. Livingston said: "For at least ten years, possibly much longer, the Congo must continue to be placed under some form of United Nations trusteeship."

The "New York Times" also recently published a dispatch from Leopoldville by its special correspondent, Tanner. This dispatch made no secret of the U.S. conspiracy to occupy the Congo for a long time through the United Nations. It wrote: "The United Nations officials, from Hammarskjöld down, all think and talk about" the length of time the United Nations will "manage" the Congo, "some say seven years, some say ten years." The dispatch revealed that U.N. Under-Secretary-General, American Bunch, instructed U.N. staff in the Congo a week ago: "You stabilize the Congo here first, and then manage it."

However, the "New York Times" had to admit that public dissatisfaction in the Congo with the U.S. conspiracy to rule the Congo through the United Nations is growing. It wrote that some Congolese leaders "want to maintain power in their country." The Congolese people are "resentful because they do not have more control over their homeland than they did before the Belgians left." The dispatch mentioned that when a United Nations military officer cheerfully talked about how the United Nations forces controlled the Lower Congo region, a Congolese man openly questioned him: "Is this our country or your country?"

Some American newspapers are openly pressuring the leaders of the Republic of the Congo to act according to the wishes of the United States. The "Christian Science Monitor" clamored on the 2nd that the United Nations currently has "a dual task" in the Congo: on the one hand, to "maintain order," and on the other hand, to "restrain those" Congolese "political leaders who have little experience and little patience."

    卢蒙巴在几内亚首都的欢迎集会上讲话
    谴责帝国主义利用联合国在刚果渔利
    几内亚总统杜尔说非洲正面临帝国主义的威胁
    新华社科纳克里7日电　刚果总理卢蒙巴6日晚上在科纳克里为欢迎他而举行的集会上讲话时强调指出，帝国主义通过联合国在刚果渔利的企图肯定将归于失败。他表示深信，求解放和求独立的力量将压倒压迫的力量。
    卢蒙巴还谈到刚果政府所奉行的积极中立主义的外交政策。
    几内亚总统塞古·杜尔也在会上讲了话，他说，刚果的事件是正义与不义之间的一场斗争，是刚果人民对独立和自由的要求与旨在维持其统治的帝国主义之间的一场斗争。他强调指出，联合国现在正面临着严重的考验，如果它不支持刚果人民的正义要求，那么它将完全丧失信用。他还强调指出，非洲的各项问题应该由非洲人来解决。他说，非洲正面临着来自帝国主义的威胁。他并且指出，帝国主义为所欲为的时代已经一去不复返了。
    新华社开罗7日电　据中东通讯社自喀土穆报道：苏丹外交部长阿赫迈德·赫尔透露，苏丹对刚果问题的看法是，非洲独立国家应当在刚果首都利奥波德维尔举行外交部长一级的会议，讨论为维护刚果独立和统一所应采取的措施，其中包括军事干预。
    这位外交部长今天通知阿联、突尼斯、加纳和埃塞俄比亚驻喀土穆的大使们，加纳共和国总统恩克鲁玛致电苏丹总理阿布德，要求苏丹武装部队在联合国范围外，在刚果进行干预。
    新华社7日讯　纽约消息：美国资产阶级报纸继续鼓吹利用联合国实现美国对刚果以至非洲其他国家的新殖民主义统治。
    “华盛顿邮报”5日在一篇题为“展望非洲”的社论中，露骨地表明了美国打着联合国招牌来控制非洲的野心。它强调老殖民国家的“溃退”已在非洲“产生了诱人的权力真空”，正是美国向非洲输出资本、攫取权力的最好机会。这家报纸说：“刚果的经验表明”，“通过联合国的计划是唯一行得通的”办法。它鼓吹美国政府要抓紧目前机会，“及时地”确定“长期的政策”和“计划”，“以更显著的和更广泛的努力”打入非洲。
    美国垄断资本家的喉舌“华尔街日报”4日发表的社论诬蔑刚果人民“缺乏独立的能力”，它叫嚷说，“在刚果人能够比较有效地照顾他们自己之前，最好的办法是让他们继续作为联合国的被保护人。”它说：美国现在在刚果作着“一件十分重要的有关自我利益的事情”。
    “纽约时报”7日发表了一个美国前驻非洲的外交官员利文斯顿的一封信，公开鼓吹至少要由联合国“托管”刚果十年。利文斯顿说：“至少十年，可能还要更长得多的时间，刚果必须继续置于某种形式的联合国托管之下”。
      “纽约时报”最近还刊登了该报特派记者坦纳从利奥波德维尔发出的一篇通讯。这篇通讯毫不掩饰美国打算通过联合国长期占领刚果的阴谋。它写道：“联合国的官兵自哈马舍尔德而下全部都想着并且谈着”联合国“管理”刚果的时间，“有些人说要七年，有些人说要十年”。通讯透露，联合国副秘书长、美国人本奇一个星期前对联合国在刚果的工作人员指示说：“你们在这里先使得刚果稳定下来，然后再管理它。”
    但是，“纽约时报”不得不承认，刚果公众对美国通过联合国统治刚果的阴谋的不满情绪正在增长。它写道，刚果一些领袖们“希望维护在他们的国家中的权力”。刚果人民“由于他们并不比比利时人离开以前对自己的家园有更大的支配权而感到愤懑”。通讯谈到当一个联合国军军官兴高彩烈地谈论联合国部队如何控制了下刚果地区时，一个刚果人公开质问他说：“这究竟是我们的国家还是你们的国家。”
    某些美国报纸正公开对刚果共和国政府领导人施加压力，要他们按美国的意旨行事。“基督教科学箴言报”2日叫喊联合国目前在刚果有“双重的任务”：一方面是“维持秩序”，另一方面是对那些“很少经验、又少耐性”的刚果“政治领袖们加以约束”。
