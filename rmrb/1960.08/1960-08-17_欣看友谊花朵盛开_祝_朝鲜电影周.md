    Joyfully Witnessing the Blossoming of Friendship
    ——Congratulating the "Korean Film Week"
    Yang Shaoren
    I welcome the fifteenth anniversary of the great liberation festival "August 15th" of our fraternal Korean people, the opening of the "Korean Film Week" in sixteen major cities in our country, and the visit of the Korean film workers' delegation to our country with extreme excitement and enthusiasm.
    The reason I am so excited and enthusiastic is not only because I had the honor of visiting this fraternal country, spending a wonderful time there, and receiving brotherly hospitality; not only because I am a film worker with a natural professional interest in film screenings; but more importantly, every time such festivals and screenings arrive, it makes us more deeply aware of the profound friendship, as close as flesh and blood, established between the people of China and Korea over the years in their joint struggles against the Japanese fascist aggressors and the American imperialist aggressors.
    The depth and breadth of this friendship is difficult to fully describe even in voluminous chapters. Taking only the exchange of film art as an example, there have been frequent and close exchanges over the years, constantly blossoming the flowers of friendship. As early as 1951, Korea screened our films "The Bridge," "Daughters of China," and "Boundless Radiance," and later successively screened "Steel Warrior," "Red Flag on Cuigang," "The White Haired Girl," "Crossing the River Reconnaissance," "Flowers of the Motherland," "The Butterfly Lovers," "Shangganling," "Blessing," "Woman Basketball Player No. 5," "Sea Soul," "Song of Youth," and "The Story of an Old Soldier." After the Chinese films were screened, they resonated strongly among the fighting Korean people, who felt very close to and encouraged by the films reflecting the life and struggle of the Chinese people. Similarly, in our country, as early as 1949, the Korean film "Smelting Furnace" was screened, and since 1950, films such as "My Hometown," "Young Guerrilla," "Return to the Front," "Defending the Homeland," "Reconnaissance," "Guerrilla Girl," "Newlyweds," "I Can't Live Like That Anymore," "Yulangchuan," "Son of the Motherland," "The Story of Shadaocheng," "Comrades," and "Patriot" have been successively screened. When Korean films were screened, they were also welcomed and loved by the majority of Chinese audiences. This is because China and Korea are as close as lips and teeth, and the people of China and Korea have established a solid friendship in their joint struggle against fascist aggressors. The Korean films reflect the Korean people's vigorous struggle, confidence in victory, optimistic fighting spirit, firm proletarian internationalist ideology, and unwavering determination to oppose American imperialist aggression and strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland in an extremely difficult struggle environment, which has inspired the work, life, and struggle of the Chinese audience. Films such as "Return to the Front" and "Defending the Homeland" greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the people to send their sons to join the army and complete their public grain tasks. "Young Guerrilla" has become a model for our Young Pioneers to learn from. After watching "The Guerrilla Girl," two female cadres in Guangzhou and Nanning said, "Kim Young-sook (the female guerrilla) is a good example for us to learn from." After watching "Comrades," Chinese audiences will never forget the touching scenes in the film that depict the flesh-and-blood fighting friendship between the people of China and Korea. "The Story of Shadaocheng" and "The Tale of Shim Chong" helped our audience understand the long revolutionary traditions and immortal heroic figures of the Korean people, and also allowed us to see how rich the treasures are in the traditional Korean national art.
    Korean film art has consistently followed Lenin's principle of partisanship and adhered to the excellent fighting tradition of actively reflecting the people's fighting life, which can also be well illustrated in the films screened during this film week. For example, "Love the Future" describes the heroic deeds of the anti-Japanese guerrillas led by Comrade Kim Il-sung during the anti-Japanese war, victoriously striking the Japanese fascist aggressors. The film shapes a series of indomitable heroic images such as Ji-san. "Nine O'Clock" educates people not to lose vigilance during the period of peaceful construction by solving a case of sabotage by lurking enemy agents in a tractor factory. "Song of Unity" praises how the Korean working class opposed the enslavement of Japanese imperialist colonial rule and strived for the right to life. Under the leadership of the Party, workers with different levels of awareness finally united and moved towards the fiery victorious struggle. "Kumgangsan Girl" depicts the fighting experience of the older generation of revolutionary artists in Korea and the rapid growth of the new generation of young artists under the Party's active education and cultivation through the story of a family reunion of father and daughter and husband and wife. "Kumgangsan" uses beautiful and moving pictures to introduce the moving scenery, rich resources, and new features under the control of the people of this famous Korean working people's resort and sanatorium.
    The themes and styles of the films screened during this film week are richer than before, and the scale of the screenings is also larger than in previous years. In addition, the Korean film workers' delegation is invited to participate in the film week screenings in our country, I am deeply convinced that this film week will surely achieve a fruitful and unprecedented harvest, and this bouquet of film flowers symbolizing Sino-Korean friendship will surely blossom, which will further promote the friendship and cultural exchanges between the two peoples. I sincerely congratulate the Korean people on achieving greater victories in the struggle to reunify their motherland and in the socialist and communist construction of their motherland.

### 欣看友谊花朵盛开——祝“朝鲜电影周”

    欣看友谊花朵盛开
    ——祝“朝鲜电影周”
    杨少任
    我怀着极其兴奋与激动的心情迎接我们兄弟的朝鲜人民伟大的解放节日“八·一五”的十五周年，迎接“朝鲜电影周”在我国十六个主要城市的揭幕，迎接朝鲜电影工作者代表团莅临我国访问。
    我之所以如此兴奋和激动，不仅是因为我曾有幸访问过这个兄弟之邦，在那里度过了一段美好的时光，受到过亲如手足般的款待；不仅由于我是一个电影工作者，对电影周映出活动有着天然的职业的爱好；更主要的，每当这样的节日和映出活动来临的时刻，就会使我们更深切地想到多少年来中朝两国人民在反对日本法西斯侵略者和抗击美帝国主义侵略者的并肩战斗中所建立起的血肉相连的情谊。
    这种情谊的深远与广泛，虽卷帙浩繁的篇章也难于充分描述。仅以电影艺术的交流方面来看，这些年来也有着频繁亲密的往来，不断地开放着友谊的花朵。早在1951年，朝鲜就映出了我国的《桥》、《中华女儿》、《光芒万丈》等影片，以后又陆续地映出了《钢铁战士》、《翠岗红旗》、《白毛女》、《渡江侦察记》、《祖国的花朵》、《梁山伯与祝英台》、《上甘岭》、《祝福》、《女篮五号》、《海魂》《青春之歌》、《老兵新传》等影片。中国影片映出后，在战斗的朝鲜人民中反映很强烈，他们对反映中国人民生活和斗争的影片，感到很亲切，并受到鼓舞。同样的，在我国，早在1949年就曾映出了朝鲜影片《熔矿炉》，自1950年以后陆续映出了《我的故乡》、《少年游击队》、《重返前线》、《保卫家乡》、《侦察兵》、《游击队的姑娘》、《新婚夫妇》、《再也不能那样活下去》、《渔郎川》、《祖国的儿子》、《沙道城的故事》、《战友》、《爱国者》等等影片。朝鲜影片上映时，同样受到我国广大观众的欢迎和喜爱。这是因为中朝两国唇齿相依，中朝人民在并肩反击法西斯侵略者的斗争中建立了牢固的友谊。朝鲜影片中所反映的朝鲜人民在异常艰苦的斗争环境中，充满了旺盛的斗争、胜利的信心、乐观主义的战斗精神，以及坚定的无产阶级国际主义思想和毫不动摇的反对美帝国主义侵略、争取祖国和平统一的意志，鼓舞了中国观众的工作、生活和斗争。像《重返前线》、《保卫家乡》、《侦察兵》等影片就大大鼓舞了人民群众送子弟参军和完成公粮任务的热情。《少年游击队》更成了我国少先队员们学习的表率。《游击队的姑娘》这部片子，广州和南宁的两位妇女干部看后都说：“金英淑（女游击队员）是我们学习的好榜样。”中国观众在看过《战友》之后，对影片中表现中朝两国人民血肉相连的战斗友谊的动人场面长久难忘。《沙道城的故事》和《沈清传》帮助了我国观众了解朝鲜人民的悠久革命传统、不朽的英雄人物，也使我们从影片中看到了朝鲜民族艺术传统中有多么丰富的宝藏。
    朝鲜电影艺术一贯遵循着列宁的党性原则和坚持积极反映人民战斗生活的优秀战斗传统，在这次电影周映出的影片中也可以得到很好的说明。像《要爱未来》就描述了抗日战争时期，在金日成同志领导下的抗日游击队胜利地打击日本法西斯侵略者的英雄事迹，影片塑造了吉山等一系列不屈服的英雄形象。《九点整》则是通过一个拖拉机厂破获潜伏的敌人特务阴谋破坏的案件，教育人们在和平建设时期，也不要丧失警惕。《团结之歌》歌颂了当年朝鲜工人阶级反对日本帝国主义殖民统治的奴役，争取生活权利，如何在党的领导下，不同觉悟程度的工人们最终团结起来走向火热的胜利斗争行列。《金刚山姑娘》是通过一个家庭父女、夫妻团圆的故事描写了朝鲜老一代革命艺术家的战斗经历和新一代青年艺术家在党的积极教育培养下迅速成长。《金刚山》用优美动人的画幅介绍了这个著名的朝鲜劳动人民憩息和休养胜地的动人景色，富饶的资源，它在人民掌握下的新风貌。
    这次电影周映出影片的题材和样式较前更为丰富，在映出的规模上也比往年更为扩大。再加以朝鲜电影工作者代表团应邀来我国参加电影周映出活动，我深信这次电影周必然得到一次丰硕的空前的收获，象征着中朝友谊的这一束电影花朵必将盛开，它将更进一步促进两国人民友谊和文化的交流。我衷心地祝贺朝鲜人民在争取祖国统一的斗争中，在祖国社会主义、共产主义建设中，取得更大的胜利。
