Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Coal mine enterprises across the country are conscientiously implementing the spirit of self-reliance, relying on the masses to find ways to save pit props. In the first half of the year, national coal production increased significantly compared with last year, but pit prop consumption was only about 80% of the same period last year. According to calculations from forty larger mining bureaus in eleven provinces and cities, the average pit prop consumption per thousand tons of coal produced from January to June has decreased by 21.3% compared to last year's average consumption quota; with June being the lowest, decreasing by about 30% compared to last year's average consumption quota. At the same time, low-consumption mines that use only a few cubic meters of pit props per thousand tons of coal and coal mining faces that do not use pit props at all for support have emerged in various places.

Pit props are the main material for coal mine production, and the consumption is very large. Therefore, for a long time, the saying "exchanging a mountain of wood for a mountain of coal" and "if you want to produce coal, you have to exchange it for wood" has been circulating among Chinese coal mine workers. Calculated at the average consumption quota in 1959, 22.17 cubic meters of pit props are needed to produce one thousand tons of coal. With the rapid development of the coal industry, the demand for pit props is increasing day by day, and the Ministry of Coal Industry started to find ways to save and substitute pit props from many aspects a few years ago. In the first half of this year, the ministry listed the issue of relying on the masses' self-reliance to save pit props as one of the main directions of the current coal mine production technological revolution. In just a few months, coal mines in various places have created many ways to save and substitute pit props. Up to now, there are no less than thirty or forty kinds of pit prop substitutes currently being used in various mines. Most of these substitutes use materials such as ceramsite, furnace slag, mineral slag ceramics, concrete, bamboo, and vitex, so they generally have the advantages of being lightweight, durable, low in cost, and easy to manufacture, which is convenient for various mines to use local materials and promote them on a large scale according to local conditions.

Coal mines in various places have also created many effective methods in strengthening the management of pit props and using them rationally. For example, Zhaogezhuang Mine in Kailuan promoted four- and eight-parallel cross-operations in support and post-withdrawal work, which not only improved the efficiency of support and post-withdrawal, but also greatly increased the recovery rate and reuse rate of pit props, thereby correspondingly reducing pit prop consumption. Jingsi Coal Mine adopted a method of combining professional management with mass management, and the materials department and various production teams generally established "pit prop management contracts," and regularly conducted competitions to evaluate pit prop savings. At present, the pit prop consumption quota per thousand tons of coal in this bureau has dropped to six to seven cubic meters, which is more than half less than last year, making it the mining bureau with the lowest pit prop consumption in the country.

Since the beginning of this year, coal mines in various places have also created favorable conditions for saving pit props in terms of reforming mining methods. At present, the country has developed more than one hundred hydraulic mining faces. These working faces do not use pit props for support at all. Various types of shield support coal mining methods, which are being vigorously promoted by Huainan, Hegang, Datong and other coal mines, do not have pit props for support on the working face except for the roadways, so the average consumption of pit props per thousand tons is reduced by one-sixth compared to the past.

Now, coal mine workers across the country are continuing to advance on the basis of saving pit props in the first half of the year. The Ministry of Coal Industry has issued special instructions, requiring all mines to continue to adopt the three-pronged approach of "substitution, management, and reform," with measures focusing on expanding substitution and strengthening management, and striving to make greater achievements in reducing pit prop consumption in the second half of the year.

### 加强管理　采用代用品  改革采煤方法  少用坑木多采煤  全国煤矿坑木消耗大幅度下降

    加强管理　采用代用品  改革采煤方法
    少用坑木多采煤
    全国煤矿坑木消耗大幅度下降
    新华社10日讯　全国煤矿企业认真贯彻自力更生的精神，依靠群众千方百计节约坑木。上半年全国煤炭产量比去年有很大增长，但是坑木消耗量却只及去年同期的80％左右。根据十一个省市的四十个较大矿务局计算，1至6月份平均每产一千吨煤的坑木消耗，已比去年的平均消耗定额下降21.3％；其中以6月份最低，比去年的平均消耗定额降低30％左右。与此同时，各地还出现了很多平均每产千吨煤只用几立米坑木的低耗矿和根本不用坑木作支柱的采煤工作面。
    坑木是煤矿生产的主要材料，而且耗用量很大。因此，很久以来，我国煤矿职工中就流传着“木山换煤山”、“要想出煤炭，就得木头换”等说法。以1959年平均消耗定额计，每产一千吨煤就需要二二点一七立方米坑木。随着煤炭工业的飞跃发展，坑木的需要量日益增加，煤炭工业部几年以前就从多方面着手寻找节约代用坑木的途径。今年上半年，这个部又把依靠群众自力更生节约坑木的问题，列为当前煤矿生产技术革命的主攻方向之一。在短短几个月内，各地煤矿就创造了许多种节约代用坑木的办法。到目前为止，仅各矿正在采用的坑木代用品，就不下三、四十种。这些代用品大部分是利用陶粒、炉渣、矿渣陶瓷、混凝土、竹子、荆条等作材料，因此一般都具有质轻耐用，成本低廉，制造容易等优点，便于各矿就地取材，因地制宜地大量推广使用。
    各地煤矿在加强坑木管理和合理使用坑木等方面，也创造了很多有效的办法。如开滦赵各庄矿在支柱和回柱工中推行四、八平行交叉作业，不但提高了支柱和回柱的效率，而且使坑木的回收率和复用率也比过去大大提高，因而相应地降低了坑木消耗。京西煤矿采用专业管理同群众管理相结合的办法，材料部门同各生产班组普遍建立了
  “坑木管理合同”，并经常进行节约坑木的评比竞赛。目前，这个局每千吨煤的坑木消耗定额已下降到六到七立方米，比去年少用了一半以上，成为全国用坑木最少的低耗矿务局。
    今年以来，各地煤矿在改革采煤方法方面，也为节约坑木创造了有利条件。目前，全国只水力采煤工作面，就已经发展到一百多个。这种工作面根本不用坑木作支柱。淮南、鹤岗、大同等煤矿正在大力推广的各种类型的掩护支架采煤法，除了巷道以外，工作面上也没有坑木作支柱，因而平均每千吨坑木消耗，比过去降低了六分之一。
    现在，全国煤矿职工正在上半年节约坑木的基础上继续前进。煤炭工业部已经发出了专门指示，要求各矿继续采取“代、管、改”三管齐下，并以扩大代用和加强管理为主的措施，争取下半年在降低坑木消耗方面作出更大成绩。
