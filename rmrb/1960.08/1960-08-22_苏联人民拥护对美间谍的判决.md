Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 20th—According to TASS, Moscow, August 20th: The Soviet people are very satisfied with the verdict of the Soviet Supreme Court on the American spy pilot, Powers. Workers, collective farmers, soldiers, and intellectuals have successively made statements to the press, expressing their support for the verdict.

    Zarly Kashimov, a construction worker from Alma-Ata, said that the court had made a serious and just judgment on Powers. This will be a lesson to all uninvited guests and a stern warning to those who like to intrude into other countries' airspace without permission.

    Representatives of the Gorky Automobile Factory in Moscow said that the verdict on Powers is a lesson for all those who advocate and engage in espionage activities. He emphasized that the provocations of the imperialists have aroused great indignation.

    Kacharov, an engineer of the Uzbek National Economic Committee, said that the trial of Powers exposed to the world the dirty inside story of the American foreign policy that regards espionage and international robbery as national principles.

    Soldiers of a certain Soviet rocket unit in the Sverdlovsk region, who shot down the "U-2" aircraft, wrote in "Pravda" that they were very satisfied with the verdict of the military tribunal on the American aerial spy. The soldiers of this unit emphasized: We must, as in the past, vigilantly stick to our combat posts, and in the future, we must continue to strengthen our combat readiness, master military technology, and firmly defend our country's territory.
