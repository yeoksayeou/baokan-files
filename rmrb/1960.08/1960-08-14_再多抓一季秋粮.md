Seize Another Season of Autumn Grain

    After completing the plan to expand the planting of late autumn crops, various regions of Jiangsu Province have mobilized the masses to plant even later autumn crops, treating these as another season of grain crops to be firmly grasped. This approach is entirely correct.

    If we expand planting after already expanding, will there be enough arable land? Will planting more late-late autumn crops affect the area of autumn-sown and summer-harvested crops? Jiangsu has adopted two methods to solve these problems: one is intercropping and interplanting; the other is to investigate and eliminate wasteland. Taizhou has adopted intercropping and interplanting, which not only increased the late-late autumn area from 180,000 mu last year to 270,000 mu, but also increased the autumn planting area by about 50,000 mu compared to last year. Zhenjiang Prefecture has planted more than 60,000 mu of late-late autumn crops simply by investigating and eliminating wasteland. In spring wheat areas, buckwheat can be planted for another season after the spring wheat harvest; in many areas in the south, late autumn potatoes can be planted for another season after the summer potato harvest. In fields with sparse seedlings, late-late autumn crops can be replanted; in fields with thin planting, late-late autumn crops can be interplanted. There are also scattered plots of land that have not been utilized. As long as we plan carefully and look closely in the fields, planting another season of late-late autumn crops after late autumn is possible in many areas.

    Late-late autumn should be planted as a season of crops and managed as a season of crops. Once planted, it must be managed well. Early autumn, late autumn, and late-late autumn have different growing times, so the management time can be staggered. With more planting, the arrangement of farm work needs to be more detailed. According to the new situation of more planting, the crops, labor, tools, and fertilizers should be lined up, prioritized, and responsibilities should be determined to ensure that there is a harvest for every planting and more harvest for more planting. In some places, late-late autumn is the third line of defense in the grain protection war, and in some places it is the fourth line of defense; the "defense" here is by no means just passive defense, but an aspect that plays a very positive role in the victory of the entire grain production front. We must look at its significance in the overall situation from the perspective of "the whole country as one chessboard."

    China's superior natural conditions for agricultural production could not be fully utilized in the past due to social constraints. Now, with the increasingly consolidated development of the people's communes, it is possible to make greater and better use of favorable natural conditions to achieve multiple plantings and multiple harvests. We must have sufficient understanding of this point. The distribution of winter isotherms in our country is roughly parallel to latitude, which means that the temperature difference from south to north is relatively large; however, the distribution of summer isotherms is very different, with latitude having almost no effect. Whether in the south or the north, along the coast or inland, summer temperatures are generally high. The north and south are more than ten thousand miles apart, but the difference in summer temperature is not very large, generally between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius, and autumn temperatures are generally suitable for the growth of certain crops. On such vast land, there is a considerable amount of time suitable for multiple crop growth, which is a good condition for expanding planting area. Achieving "evergreen in all four seasons" in certain areas and "evergreen in three seasons" in more areas is entirely possible, even if we don't include vegetables, just in terms of grain crops. The late-late autumn expansion campaign launched by various regions in Jiangsu Province has turned this possibility into a reality. This is very meaningful and worthy of attention and imitation by all regions with suitable conditions.

### 再多抓一季秋粮

    再多抓一季秋粮
    江苏省各地区在完成扩大种植晚秋作物的计划以后，又发动群众大种晚晚秋，把晚晚秋也当作一季粮食作物紧紧抓住。这个做法十分正确。
    扩种之后再扩种，有那么多耕地吗？多种晚晚秋，会不会影响秋播夏收作物的面积呢？江苏各地采取两种办法解决了这些问题：一个办法是套种间作；一个办法是查荒灭荒。泰州采取套种间作的办法，不但晚晚秋面积由去年的十八万亩扩大到二十七万亩，秋播面积也可以比去年扩大五万亩左右。镇江专区只是通过查荒灭荒，就已经种下晚晚秋六万多亩。在春小麦地区，收了春小麦也还可以再种一季荞麦；在南方很多地区，收了夏薯还可以再种一季晚秋薯。缺苗较多的地里可以补种晚晚秋；种得较稀的地里可以套种晚晚秋。零星土地没有利用的也还有。只要瞻前顾后、精心安排，只要深入田间、细查细看，继晚秋之后再种一季晚晚秋，在很多地区都是能够做到的。
    晚晚秋要当一季庄稼种，也要当一季庄稼管。种下就要管好。早秋、晚秋、晚晚秋，生长时间不一致，管理的时间正好可以互相错开。种得更多了，农活的安排就要更细致。要根据种得更多的新情况，把作物、劳力、工具、肥料等等排排队，分别先后缓急，确定管理责任，保证有种就有收，多种就多收。在有些地方，晚晚秋是保粮大战的第三道防线，在有些地方是第四道防线；这里的“防”决不只是消极的防守，而是对整个粮食生产战线的胜利起着很大积极作用的一个方面。要把它放在“全国一盘棋”上来看它在全局中的意义。
    我国农业生产的优越的自然条件，在过去受社会条件的限制不能充分发挥作用，现在，人民公社日益巩固地发展，已经有可能更多更好地利用有利的自然条件发挥多种多收的作用。对于这一点，要有足够的认识。我国冬季等温线的分布，大致与纬度平行，也就是说从南到北气温相差较大；可是，夏季等温线的分布却大不相同，纬度的影响几乎没有什么作用，不论南方和北方，沿海和内地，夏季气温普遍较高。南北相距一万多里，夏季气温的差别并不很大，一般都在摄氏二十到三十度之间，秋季气温一般也都适宜某些作物生长。在这样辽阔的土地上，有着相当长的适宜多种作物生长的时间，这对于扩大种植面积是很好的条件。在一定的地区做到“四季常青”，在更多的地区做到“三季常青”，即使不把蔬菜算在里边，光就粮食作物来说，也是完全可能的。江苏省各地发起的扩种晚晚秋运动，把这种可能性变成了现实性。这是十分有意义的，值得一切有条件的地区注意仿行。
