Editor's Note: "Song of Sino-Burmese Friendship" was written by a composer in March of this year, during the visit of the Chinese National Song and Dance Troupe to Burma, to welcome the cultural envoys of the Chinese people. At that time, our National Song and Dance Troupe performed this song as a male chorus. Recently, the Cultural and Goodwill Art Troupe of the Union of Burma visited and performed in our country, and the choir also sang this song at the opening ceremony in Beijing.

    中缅友谊之歌
    编者附记：《中缅友谊之歌》是今年3月间，中国民族歌舞团访缅演出时，作曲家为了欢迎中国人民的文化使者而写的。当时，我国民族歌舞团用男声小合唱演唱了这首歌。最近，缅甸联邦文化友好艺术团来我国访问演出，在北京的开幕式上，合唱队全体也演唱了这首歌。
