Cadres Going to the Fields Brings Many New Things

    Canteen Food Tastes Better
    In the No. 2 Production Team's canteen of the Gao Village Brigade, a new cook has been added. He is not tall, but he is neat and efficient in his work. Whether it is carrying water, chopping vegetables, making steamed buns, or kneading dough, he is excellent at everything. He also cares about the commune members in every way, constantly accepts their opinions, making the food more delicious and everyone more satisfied. This new cook is Chen Xiuwen, the Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, who has been sent down here to also serve as the Brigade Party Branch Secretary.
    As soon as Comrade Chen Xiuwen arrived at this brigade, he determined, according to the requirements of the Commune Party Committee, to make the No. 2 Production Team his key team and the No. 2 Team's canteen his experimental canteen. On the first morning he arrived at this team, he went to the fields to work with the commune members and ate breakfast with them in the fields. At noon, when he went to the canteen to cook, he focused on inspecting the canteen work. During the inspection, he found that there was little water and not much vegetable cultivation locally, and the canteen had not actively tried to solve the problem. As a result, each person ate only a little over one kilogram of vegetables per day, which was less than half of the standard stipulated by the Commune Party Committee. Secretary Chen patiently held discussions with the cook and the administrator, came up with solutions, and tried every means to ensure that the commune members ate more vegetables. The commune members all praised in unison: "Secretary Chen is really capable, grasping production with one hand and cooking with the other."

专栏：干部下田新事多

    食堂饭菜更香
    在高村大队第二生产队的中食堂里，增添了一个新炊事员。他个子不大，但做活干净利落，不管是担水、切菜、做馍、和面，都一个顶一个。他还处处关心社员，不断接受社员意见，让饭菜更可口，大家更满意。这个新来的炊事员，就是下放到这里兼任大队支部书记的公社党委副书记陈秀文。
    陈秀文同志一来到这个大队，便根据公社党委的要求，确定以第二生产队为他的重点队，第二队的中食堂为他的试验食堂。他来到这个队的第一天早上，便和社员们一道下田做活，一起在地里吃早饭。中午，他到食堂里去做饭时，着重检查了食堂工作，检查中，发现当地的水地少，种菜不多，食堂又没有积极设法解决，结果每人每天平均只吃一斤多菜，还达不到公社党委规定标准的一半。陈书记便耐心地同炊事员和管理员仔细座谈，想出了解决办法，千方百计地保证社员多吃菜。社员们都同声称赞：“陈书记真能干，一手抓生产，一手抓做饭。”
