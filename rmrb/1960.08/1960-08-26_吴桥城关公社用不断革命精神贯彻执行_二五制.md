Wuqiao Chengguan Commune Uses Continuous Revolution Spirit to Implement the "Two-Five System"

Hebei Province, Wuqiao County, Chengguan People's Commune is the originator of the "Two-Five System" leadership method. For several months, cadres at all levels have not only resolutely implemented this scientific leadership method, but the commune party committee has also, in the spirit of continuous revolution, constantly summarized experience and enriched the content of the "Two-Five System", making it more perfect and promoting the sustained leap forward in agricultural production.

    Strengthening the Front Lines of Production

The Wuqiao Chengguan Commune and its various management districts have a total of 310 cadres, both detached and non-detached from production. Among them, the commune party committee and administrative departments have 33 cadres, the management districts have 141 cadres, the commune-level state-owned enterprise departments have 133 cadres, and there are also 3 cadres from county-level organs assigned to teams in the countryside. After implementing the "Two-Five System", the commune party committee, based on the principle of participating in production and leading production, sent more than 90% of the cadres to the front lines of production. One type of cadre went down to the countryside to be permanently assigned to teams, totaling 206 people (the commune party committee standing committee members were assigned to the management districts). The cadres assigned to the teams lived in 116 production teams, ate, lived, labored, and consulted with the commune members, based on the principle of strengthening weak links. The other type was not permanently assigned to teams, mainly cadres from departments with stronger professional functions, such as medical departments, stores, and banks. After going to the countryside, they participated in production and carried out professional activities. According to statistics in June, among the 133 cadres in these departments, in addition to 29.3% of the cadres being permanently assigned to teams, 45 people frequently traveled to the countryside.

    Learn, Do, Rotate, Help

After cadres at all levels went deep into the front lines of production, they created many good working methods. These methods can be summarized into four characters: Learn, Do, Rotate, Help.

Learn, mainly means learning from the team cadres and the broad masses. Learn their excellent qualities and revolutionary vigor, and learn their advanced agricultural technology. There are two main forms of learning: one is learning anytime, anywhere through doing, rotating, and helping, and the other is hiring experienced farmers as teachers and establishing technical advisory groups. The former mainly focuses on learning general agricultural technology, while the latter focuses on learning more complex agricultural technology.

To do, rotate, and help well, one must learn well. In the early stages of promoting the "Two-Five System," although many cadres learned a lot of production skills through production practice, it had not yet formed a conscious and widespread action. Under the leadership of the higher party organization, the commune party committee listed "Learning" as one of the main contents of the "Two-Five System." At the same time, it required all management districts and teams to quickly restore the "Production Advisory Group" and "Eight Immortals Think Tank." In addition, each cadre should apprentice several experienced farmers (poor and lower-middle peasants) as their production advisors. In the process of implementation, the commune leaders played an exemplary role. For example, Chen Xingwen, deputy secretary of the commune party committee and director of the commune, was originally responsible for political and legal work and lacked agricultural production knowledge. But because he humbly learned from the peasants, he has initially mastered the cultivation and management techniques of cotton, sweet potatoes, corn, and other crops. He also combined it with book knowledge and created 15 model fields related to planting techniques, field management, and alkali land transformation with the masses. He said: "Several months of 'Agricultural University' have basically removed the layman's hat on agricultural production!"

Do, means conscientiously participating in production. The time spent participating in labor varies depending on the nature of the work. Leading cadres such as the commune party committee secretary and director generally participate in labor for about two days a week, because they need to grasp the overall situation, and general cadres participate in labor for about three days. The cadres of the management district generally spend three or four days a week working. The location of the labor is generally fixed in the team to which the general cadre is assigned, and the location of the labor of leading cadres such as the commune party committee secretary and director is more flexible, but most of the time it is fixed in one team. No matter where they work, the number of hours they participate in labor is signed and sealed by the team leader and recorded in the labor record book for regular inspection. In this way, the time for cadres to participate in labor is guaranteed by the system. According to statistics, before the implementation of the "Two-Five System", only 59 cadres at the commune and management district level participated in labor. At the same time, due to the limitations of meetings and administrative work, they only participated in labor for seven or eight days a month. Now, almost all of them have participated in labor, and most of them work for about 15 days a month.

The purpose of cadres participating in production is to summarize and promote advanced experiences in a timely manner through production practice, and to quickly discover and solve problems. Therefore, it is necessary to participate well in production and lead production well; it is necessary to be an ordinary worker, but not just an ordinary worker. In the early stage of promoting the "Two-Five System" in Wuqiao Chengguan Commune, there were roughly three situations in the matter of "Do": First, both labor and command, which accounted for the vast majority of cadres; second, only burying oneself in hard work, ignoring the guidance of production, which also accounted for a considerable part of cadres; third, commanding more and laboring less, accounting for a very small number of cadres. After discovering this situation, the commune party committee, through the evaluation of cadres, promptly summarized the experience of "Do", criticized the latter two practices, and promoted the first practice, and clearly stated that cadres should go to the most critical places to participate in labor in order to dissect sparrows and guide the overall situation. In this way, the content of "Do" was enriched and its purpose was made clearer. Grasping the ideological key, grasping the production key, and grasping the life key have now become the action slogans of the vast number of cadres. For example, it has not rained thoroughly in Chengguan Commune for nearly 300 days, and drought resistance is a key issue. However, the situation of each team in drought resistance is not exactly the same, and cadres at all levels can find the key in the key according to different situations. Some places focus on digging wells, some places focus on tool reform, and some places focus on pest control... Wang Dianqing, deputy secretary of the commune party committee, is in charge of Chengguan Management District. Most of the land here can be irrigated, but 800 acres of quicksand land are difficult to dig wells and are still threatened by drought, and some cadres lack confidence in digging wells. Therefore, Wang Dianqing seized this key issue and personally worked with more than 20 people, and explored the experience of digging wells in quicksand land, and the work was fully launched.

The purpose of Rotating is to grasp the overall situation, achieve a combination of point and surface, and guide work in a timely manner. The time for Rotating varies from person to person, place to place, and time to time. The commune party committee secretary and director are responsible for the management district and also responsible for the work of a department, so they spend more time on Rotating the surface. In the five days of going deep, they generally spend about two days on Rotating the surface. The main leading cadres of the management district spend roughly the same time on Rotating the surface. General cadres assigned to teams spend roughly one and a half days on Rotating the surface. They mostly use production gaps to rotate the surface, and some cadres assigned to teams take the method of "rotating in the morning, working in the afternoon, and helping in the evening." The time for rotating the surface also varies depending on the agricultural situation. Generally speaking, when the agricultural work is tight, the time for rotating the surface is longer; normally, the time for rotating the surface is shorter.

When rotating the surface, it is also necessary to have a purpose and not simply take the "riding a horse and watching flowers" approach. Cadres of Chengguan Commune generally go to advanced and backward places to rotate according to the spirit of "grasping the two ends and leading the middle", in order to summarize and promote advanced experience in a timely manner and promote the backward to catch up with the advanced. This year, Chengguan Commune universally adopted the method of cutting wheat for the first time, and the wheat stubble remained on the ground, affecting the quality of summer sowing. In order to solve this problem, Wang Zhili, the first secretary of the commune party committee, personally rotated around and absorbed the good experiences of various places, and proposed the "shallow tillage to eliminate stubble" sowing method, so that the summer sowing task was completed on time, with good quality, and in sufficient quantity.

Helping, means being a good advisor to the cadres of the production team. The standard is: the political and ideological consciousness and leadership level of the team cadres are greatly improved, they are supported by the masses, and the production is done well. According to this spirit, the vast majority of cadres in Chengguan Commune have grasped ideology, looked at plans, and helped the team cadres to specifically arrange agricultural work, changing the "disorganized battle" situation of some teams. In terms of helping forms, there are roughly two types: one is to help with whatever is encountered, mostly carried out in doing and rotating; the other is to help with a plan, mostly using the evening time.

However, when Chengguan Commune first promoted the "Two-Five System", a few cadres did not fully understand the significance of being an advisor, had high work enthusiasm, and often did not pay attention to working methods, replacing some of the duties of the team cadres, affecting the work enthusiasm of some grassroots cadres. The commune party committee discovered this problem in a timely manner and helped them in various ways, reversing the situation in a timely manner. At the same time, it summarized good experiences and made the following provisions: First, we must humbly and actively help team cadres to come up with ideas, think of ways, plan work, and arrange work. When planning and arranging work, we must fully promote democracy, give play to the wisdom of cadres and the masses, and not rely on subjective assumptions to replace the decisions of team cadres and the masses. Second, when holding meetings, deploying work, and guiding production, we should help team cadres prepare in advance and let the branch secretary and team leader do it, and not command and deploy everything by ourselves; when necessary, we can also personally come forward to make reports and be the commander. Third, we must set an example for cadres and the masses. Exemplarily implement the resolutions of the party branch, exemplarily abide by the rules and regulations of the team, and exemplarily implement the party's policies and guidelines. In this way, cadres have a clearer understanding of the important significance of "Help" and have something to follow when working.

Holding Good Meetings and Regularizing Learning

In order to ensure that cadres go deep into the front lines of production and improve the political, ideological, and leadership level of cadres, the Chengguan Commune Party Committee pays special attention to improving the quality of meetings and strengthening the theoretical study of cadres.

The meetings of Chengguan Commune are fixed to be held on Tuesdays every week. This is to dovetail with the county party committee's meeting held every Monday, so that the intention of the county party committee can be implemented and implemented in a timely manner. Each meeting adopts the method of first concentrating and then dispersing. First, the cadres of the commune and the management district gather in the commune to hold a meeting (generally taking up a morning or a little more), and then the cadres of the management district go back to hold meetings separately. The meetings of the management district absorb the party branch secretaries and party member team leaders of the production team to participate, and study and deploy the work of the management district according to the intention of the commune meeting. In this way, not only the layers of meetings are reduced (in the past, meetings were held at each level and conveyed at each level), but also the intention of the commune party committee can be delivered to the production team on the same day. Before the implementation of the "Two-Five System", the commune party committee generally held two or three meetings a week, and the management district held three to five meetings; now, in most cases, only one meeting is needed per week. Because in the "Five" time, a large number of cadres go deep into the grassroots and know more and deeper about the actual situation, so people speak particularly enthusiastically at the meeting, thus strengthening the collective leadership of the party and making everyone come up with ideas, everyone make resolutions, and everyone go to implement them.

The theoretical study of cadres is conducted on Mondays, and cultural study is uniformly stipulated in the morning of Mondays and Tuesdays. In the early stage of the implementation of the "Two-Five System", cadres of the commune and the management district gathered to study separately. Later, the following problems were found to be still difficult to solve:

(1) Many people in the management district who are studying below are still burdened by trivial matters, and the time cannot be fully guaranteed; (2) Due to the limitations of theoretical level, many management district cadres cannot start a lively discussion; (3) Cultural learning is carried out in a decentralized manner, and there are not enough teachers to allocate. In view of this situation, the commune party committee decided to adopt a method based on centralized learning, combined with self-study. During the study time, the commune, the management district, and the county's assigned team cadres all gather at the commune to listen to the unified class, and then learn and discuss in groups with the management district as a unit. The commune party committee secretary and director participate in the management district they are assigned to, and serve as tutoring work on one hand while learning on the other. In this way, the study time is guaranteed and the quality of the study is improved. Comprehensively implement the spirit of the "Two-Five System"

The production team is the basic combat unit in the countryside, and the broad masses of commune members are the fighters in this basic combat unit, and all the party's policies and guidelines must be implemented through them. Therefore, scientifically arranging their production, work, and study time is an important part of implementing the "Two-Five System". To this end, the commune party committee, in the spirit of the "Two-Five System", promoted the working methods of "Learn, Do, Research, Meet" and "Combination of Labor, Study, and Leisure" in the production team and among the broad masses of commune members.

The "Learn, Do, Research, Meet" working method was first piloted among the cadres of the second team of Shuangliudian Management District and achieved good experience, and has been promoted throughout the commune. Learn, means using the evening time to study with the commune members; Do, means participating in labor with the commune members every day except for attending meetings at the higher level; Research, means the team cadres hold meetings to study work. In order to dovetail with the management district's meeting on Tuesdays, the team cadres' meeting time is uniformly conducted on Wednesday evenings; Meet, means the team cadres hold temporary meetings, the time is before and after meals, or before and after study. Although this working method has not been implemented for a long time, because the production, study, and meeting time of the team cadres have been properly arranged, all work has gradually been put on the right track and no longer fought "disorganized battles."

At the same time, the commune party committee also promoted the "combination of labor, study, and leisure with one, two, and four" system among the commune members. That is, in seven days, there are four evenings for study (politics and technology each account for one evening, and cultural study accounts for two evenings), one evening for holding mass meetings to summarize work and discuss production plans. The other two evenings are for commune members to freely engage in activities and cultural entertainment. As a result, not only is the unity of action of the entire commune guaranteed, but also the spirit of combining work and rest is implemented, promoting production and all work. Some commune members praised: "The one, two, and four system is good, and labor, study, and leisure are all arranged. Studying enters the red and expert road, and leisure spurs the energy to soar into the sky. With skills and energy, agricultural harvest is inevitable!"

    吴桥城关公社用不断革命精神贯彻执行“二五制”
    中共吴桥县委办公室　本报记者
    河北省吴桥县城关人民公社，是“二五制”领导方法的创始者。几个月来，各级干部不但坚决贯彻执行了这一科学的领导方法，而且公社党委还本着不断革命的精神，不断总结经验，充实了“二五制”的内容，使之更为完善，推动农业生产持续跃进。
      加强生产第一线
    吴桥城关公社和各管理区，脱产和不脱产的干部共有三百一十人。其中公社党委和行政部门有干部三十三人，管理区有干部一百四十一人，公社级的国营企业部门有干部一百三十三人，还有县级机关下乡包队的干部三人。实行
  “二五制”后，公社党委根据参加生产、领导生产的原则，把90％以上的干部都派往生产第一线。下去的干部，一种是常年包队的，共有二百零六人（公社党委常委包管理区）。包队的干部根据加强薄弱环节的原则，分别住在一百一十六个生产小队里，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。另一种是不固定包队的，主要是一些业务性较强的部门的干部，如医务部门、商店、银行等。他们下乡后，一面参加生产，一面开展业务活动。据6月份的统计，在这些部门的一百三十三名干部中，除29.3％的干部常年包队外，还有四十五人经常流动下乡。
    学、干、转、帮
    各级干部在深入生产第一线以后，创造出了许多好的工作方法。这些方法，概括起来有四个字：学、干、转、帮。
    学，主要是向小队干部和广大群众学习。学习他们的优秀品质和革命干劲，学习他们的先进农业技术。学习的形式主要有两种，一种是通过干、转、帮，随时随地的学习，一种是聘请老农为师，成立技术顾问团。前一种主要是学习一般农业技术，后一种则是学习比较复杂的农业技术。
    要干好、转好和帮好，必须学好。城关公社在推行“二五制”前一阶段，虽然许多干部都通过生产实践，学习了不少生产本领，但还没有形成自觉的、广泛的行动。公社党委在上级党组织的领导下，把“学”字列为“二五制”的主要内容之一。同时要求各管理区和小队，把“生产顾问团”、“八仙参谋部”迅速恢复起来。另外，每个干部都要拜几名有生产经验的老农（贫农和下中农）为师，当自己的生产参谋。在执行过程中，公社领导干部都起了模范带头作用。如公社党委副书记、公社主任陈兴文，原来负责政法方面的工作，缺乏农业生产知识。但由于他虚心向农民学习，已经初步掌握了棉花、甘薯、玉米等作物的栽培和管理技术。他还和书本知识结合起来，同群众一起创出了有关种植技术、田间管理、改造碱地等十五种样板田。他说：几个月的“农业大学”，使我基本上摘掉了在农业生产上的外行帽子！
    干，就是扎扎实实地参加生产。参加劳动的时间，因工作性质不同而有差异。公社党委书记、主任等领导干部，因为要掌握全面的情况，每周参加劳动时间，一般在两天左右，一般干部在三天左右。管理区的干部，每周劳动的时间都在三、四天上下。劳动的地点，一般干部固定在所包的小队，公社党委书记、主任等领导干部，劳动地点比较灵活，但多数时间固定在一个小队上。不管在哪里劳动，其参加劳动的时数，都由小队长签名盖章，记入劳动记工本，定期检查。这样，就在制度上保证了干部参加劳动的时间。据统计，实行“二五制”前，公社和管理区一级的干部，只有五十九人参加劳动，同时由于会议和事务工作的限制，他们每月参加劳动的时间也只有七、八天。现在，几乎全部参加了劳动，每月劳动时间多数在十五天左右。
    干部参加生产的目的，在于通过生产实践，及时总结与推广先进经验，迅速发现问题解决问题。因此，既要参加好生产，又必须领导好生产；既要当一个普通劳动者，又不仅仅是一个普通劳动者。吴桥城关公社在推行“二五制”前期，在“干”的问题上，大体上出现三种情况：第一，又劳动，又指挥，这种干部占绝大多数；第二，光是埋头苦干，忽视了指导生产，这种干部也有相当一部分；第三，指挥的多，劳动的少，占干部中的极少数。公社党委发现这一情况后，通过对干部的评比，及时总结了“干”的经验，批判了后两种作法，推广了第一种作法，并明确提出：干部要到最关键的地方去参加劳动，以便解剖麻雀，指导全面。这样，就充实了“干”的内容，使它的目的性更加明确。抓思想关键，抓生产关键，抓生活关键，目前已成为广大干部的行动口号。比如，城关公社近三百天未下透雨，抗旱是个关键问题。但在抗旱中各小队的情况也不完全相同，各级干部都能根据不同情况，寻找关键中的关键。有的地方着重抓打井，有的地方着重抓工具改革，有的地方则着重抓除虫……。公社党委副书记王殿卿，分工包城关管理区。这里的大多数土地都能浇上水，只有八百亩流沙地，打井困难，仍然受干旱的威胁，有些干部对打井又缺乏信心。于是，王殿卿就抓住这一关键问题，带着二十多人亲自去干，摸索出了流沙地打井的经验，工作才全面展开。
    转的目的，在于掌握全面情况，做到点面结合，及时指导工作。转的时间，因人因地因时制宜。公社党委书记和主任，分包管理区，同时还要负责一个部门的工作，因此用于转面的时间较多。在深入的五天时间中，他们转面的时间，一般在两天左右。管理区的主要领导干部，转面时间大体相同。一般包队干部的转面时间，大体在一天半左右。他们多利用生产空隙转面，有些包队干部则采取“早晨转、上下午干、晚上帮”的办法。农活情况不同，转面的时间也有不同。一般地说，农活紧张时，转面的时间较长；平常，转面的时间较短。
    转面时，也要有目的，不能一律采取“走马看花”的方法。城关公社的干部，一般都根据“抓两头，带中间”的精神，到先进和落后的地方去转，以便及时总结推广先进经验，促使落后赶先进。城关公社今年第一次普遍采取割麦的办法，麦茬留在地面，影响夏播质量。为了解决这一问题，公社党委第一书记王之礼亲自到各地转了一下，吸取各地好的经验，提出了“浅耕灭茬”的播种办法，使夏播任务按时、按质、按量完成。
    帮，就是当好生产小队干部的参谋。其标准是：小队干部的政治思想觉悟和领导水平大大提高，得到群众的拥护，生产搞得好。根据这一精神，城关公社的绝大多数干部，在深入下去以后，都作到了抓思想、看计划，并帮助小队干部具体安排农活，改变了某些小队“打乱仗”的情况。在帮助的形式上，大体上有两种，一是碰到什么帮什么，多在干和转中进行；另一种是有计划的帮，多利用晚上的时间。
    但是，城关公社在刚推行“二五制”时，也有少数干部对当参谋的意义认识不够，工作热情高，常常不注意工作方法，代替了小队干部的部分职务，影响了某些基层干部的工作积极性。公社党委及时发现了这一问题，并通过各种方式对他们进行帮助，及时扭转了这一情况。同时，总结了好的经验，作出如下规定：第一，要虚心地、积极地帮助小队干部出主意，想办法，计划工作，安排工作。在计划安排工作时，要充分发扬民主，发挥干部和群众的智慧，不能凭主观臆断，代替队干部和群众的决议。第二，在召开会议、布置工作、指导生产时，应帮助小队干部事先作好准备，让支部书记和小队长去作，不要事事自己去指挥，去布置；必要时，自己也可以亲自出马作报告，当指挥。第三，要作好干部和群众的榜样。模范地执行党支部的决议，模范地遵守小队的规章制度，模范地贯彻执行党的方针政策。这样，就使得干部更加明确了“帮”的重要意义，工作起来有所遵循。
  会议开得好，学习经常化
    为了确保干部深入生产第一线，并提高干部的政治思想和领导水平，城关公社党委特别注意提高会议的质量和加强干部的理论学习。
    城关公社的会议，固定在每周的星期二召开。这是为了和县委每星期一举行的会议衔接对口，便于及时贯彻执行县委的意图。每次会议，都采取先集中、后分散的办法。先由公社和管理区的干部，集中在公社开会（一般占一个上午或稍多一点的时间），然后管理区的干部再回去分别开会。管理区的会议，吸收生产小队的党支部书记和党员队长参加，根据公社会议意图，研究、部署本管理区的工作。这样，不但减少了会议层次（过去是逐级开会，逐级传达），同时使公社党委意图当天即可下达生产小队。“二五制”实行前，公社党委每周一般要开二、三次会议，管理区要开三至五次会议；现在，在绝大多数情况下，每周只需要开一次会议。由于在“五”的时间内，大批干部深入基层，对实际情况了解得多，了解得深，因此开会时发言的人特别踊跃，从而加强了党的集体领导，作到了大家出主意，大家作决议，大家去执行。
    干部的理论学习在星期一进行，文化学习统一规定在星期一、二的早晨。“二五制”实行的前一阶段，公社和管理区的干部，分别集中学习。后来发现下列问题，仍然不好解决：
  （一）管理区的干部在下面学习，许多人仍然受琐事牵累，时间不能完全保证；（二）由于理论水平的限制，许多管理区干部不能展开热烈讨论；（三）文化学习分散进行，教员不够分配。针对这一情况，公社党委决定采取以集中学习为主，结合自学的办法。在学习时间内，公社、管理区和县下乡的包队干部，都集中到公社统一听课，再以管理区为单位分组自学和讨论。公社党委书记和主任，分别参加所包的管理区，一方面学习，一方面担任辅导工作。这样，既保证了学习时间，又提高了学习质量。全面贯彻“二五制”的精神
    生产小队，是农村的基本作战单位，广大社员又是这一基本作战单位中的战斗员，党的一切方针政策，都要通过他们贯彻执行。因此，科学地安排他们的生产、工作和学习时间，是贯彻执行“二五制”的重要一环。为此，公社党委本着“二五制”的精神，在生产小队和广大社员中，分别推行了“学、干、研、碰”和“劳、学、逸相结合”的工作方法。
    “学、干、研、碰”工作方法，先在双刘店管理区第二小队干部中试行，并取得了良好经验，已在全社范围推广。学，就是利用晚上的时间，和社员一起学习；干，除到上级开会外，天天和社员一起参加劳动；研，小队干部开会研究工作。为了和管理区星期二的会议衔接对口，小队干部的开会时间，统一在星期三晚上进行；碰，就是小队干部开临时碰头会，时间在饭前饭后，或学习前后。这一工作方法虽然实行不很久，但由于小队干部的生产、学习和开会时间有了妥善安排，各项工作都逐步纳入正规，不再打“乱仗”。
    与此同时，公社党委又在社员中推行了“一二四劳、学、逸相结合”的制度。就是在七天内，有四个晚上学习（政治和技术各占一个晚上，文化学习占两个晚上），一个晚上开群众会，总结工作和讨论生产计划。另外两个晚上，是社员自由活动和文化娱乐时间。这样作的结果，不但保证了全社行动统一，而且也贯彻了劳逸结合精神，推动了生产和各项工作。有的社员赞颂道：“一二四制办法好，劳学逸都安排到。有学走进红专路，有逸干劲冲九霄。有了本领和干劲，农业丰收没有跑！”
