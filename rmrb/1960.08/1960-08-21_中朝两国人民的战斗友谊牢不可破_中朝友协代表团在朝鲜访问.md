Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 20th: The delegation of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, headed by Li Dequan, President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association and Minister of Health of China, has visited Kaesong and the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Zekam-ri, Sunan County, South Pyongan Province in recent days.

The delegation was warmly welcomed by the people of Kaesong during its two-day visit to the city. On the evening of the 17th, people from all walks of life in Kaesong held a grand get-together with the delegation. Wu Jae-ryong, Chairman of the Kaesong City Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, and Li Dequan, head of the delegation, spoke at the meeting. In his speech, Wu Jae-ryong said that the great strength of the friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese people was greatly demonstrated in the Korean Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggression of US imperialism. The friendship, unity and militant friendship between the Korean and Chinese people is an example of lofty proletarian internationalism, which can only appear among people under the leadership of Marxist-Leninist parties. He said that the delegation's visit to Kaesong will contribute to further strengthening the friendship and unity between the two peoples. In her speech, Li Dequan warmly praised the great victories achieved by the Korean people in opposing the aggression of US imperialism and in socialist construction. She said: The Chinese and Korean people have shared the same destiny and breathed the same air in each other's national democratic revolution and in defending the cause of socialism, and have supported each other with blood and lives. This proletarian internationalist militant friendship between our two peoples, forged with blood, is unbreakable and will be further consolidated and developed.

Chairman Wu Jae-ryong and Major General Zhu Changjun, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, hosted banquets on the 17th and 18th respectively to welcome the delegation. The delegation laid wreaths at the Cemetery of Martyrs of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in Kaesong. In addition, the delegation also visited Panmunjom and scenic spots near Kaesong.

When the delegation visited the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Zekam-ri, Sunan County, South Pyongan Province, on the 19th, they gathered with the Korean elders, brothers and sisters to talk about the deep friendship between the two peoples.

When head of the delegation Li Dequan, deputy head Li Jiebo, and all members of the delegation, accompanied by Choi Ki-chul, deputy chairman of the Korean Committee for Foreign Cultural Liaison, arrived at the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative, they were warmly welcomed by the cadres and members of the cooperative. On that day, arches were set up at the entrance of the village, and many members of the cooperative welcomed the delegation along the road, waving the national flags of Korea and China.

Li Jong-soon, chairman of the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative, introduced to the delegation the development and production of the cooperative, and many touching stories of China-Korea friendship that have occurred in this agricultural cooperative. In May 1953, when the Korean armistice was about to be realized, US imperialism sent planes to destroy the dam of the reservoir that irrigated more than 3,000 jeongbo of land in the agricultural cooperative. The flood submerged nearby villages and destroyed many farmland. At that time, the Chinese People's Volunteers stationed nearby dispatched more than 10,000 workers, who, together with the Korean People's Army, worked day and night to quickly repair the dam. The Korean people built a monument on a hill next to the dam to commemorate the achievements of the volunteers.

The delegation also met with Grandma Choi Sa-ryeol, who was rescued by the Volunteers from an enemy bombing, and presented the agricultural cooperative with woven portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Kim Il-sung, radios, and large red palace lanterns as gifts. The agricultural cooperative also gave the delegation gifts such as apples.

    中朝两国人民的战斗友谊牢不可破
    中朝友协代表团在朝鲜访问
    新华社平壤20日电　以中朝友好协会会长、我国卫生部长李德全为首的中朝友好协会代表团，连日来访问了开城和平安南道顺安郡泽岩里朝中友谊农业社。
    代表团在开城访问的两天中，受到了开城人民的热烈欢迎。17日晚上，开城各界人民同代表团举行了盛大的联欢晚会。朝鲜劳动党开城市委员会委员长吴济龙和李德全团长在会上讲了话。吴济龙在讲话中说，朝中两国人民的友谊团结的伟大力量，在反对美帝国主义武装侵略的朝鲜祖国解放战争中大大发挥出来了。朝中两国人民之间的友好团结和战斗友谊是崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神的榜样，是只有在马克思列宁主义的党的领导下的人民中才能出现的。他说，代表团访问开城将对进一步加强两国人民的友好团结作出贡献。李德全在讲话中热烈赞扬了朝鲜人民在反对美帝国主义的侵略和在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大胜利。她说：中朝两国人民在彼此的民族民主革命和保卫社会主义事业中，曾经同命运、共呼吸，并且用鲜血和生命互相支援。我们两国人民的这种用鲜血凝成的无产阶级国际主义的战斗友谊，是牢不可破的，并且将会进一步地巩固和发展。
    吴济龙委员长和军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将，分别在17日和18日设宴欢迎代表团。代表团在开城曾向朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的烈士陵园敬献了花圈。另外，代表团还参观访问了板门店，开城附近的名胜。
    代表团19日访问平安南道顺安郡泽岩里朝中友谊农业社时，同朝鲜父老兄弟姊妹们欢聚一堂，畅叙两国人民间的深厚情谊。
    当李德全团长、李颉伯副团长和代表团全体成员由朝鲜对外文化联络委员会副委员长崔基哲等陪同，到达朝中友谊农业社时，受到了农业社的干部、社员们的热烈欢迎。这天，村口搭起了彩牌，许多社员拿着朝中两国国旗在道路两旁夹道欢迎代表团。
    朝中友谊农业社社长李宗淳向代表团介绍了这个社的发展和生产情况，和在这个农业社里出现过的许多动人的朝中友谊故事。在1953年5月，朝鲜停战快实现的时候，美帝国主义派飞机炸毁了灌溉这个农业社三千多町步土地的水库的大坝，大水淹没了附近的村庄，并冲毁了许多农田。当时驻在附近的中国人民志愿军部队，出了一万多个工，同朝鲜人民军一起，日夜突击，很快修复了大坝。朝鲜人民在坝旁的一座山岗上修了一座纪念塔，来纪念志愿军的功绩。
    代表团在农业社还会见了被志愿军从敌机轰炸中救出的崔史烈老大娘，并赠送给农业社以毛泽东主席和金日成首相的织锦像、收音机和红色的大宫灯等礼品。农业社也赠给代表团苹果等礼品。
