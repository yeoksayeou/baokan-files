Hunan's Intercropping Area Exceeds Ten Million Mu, Doubling Last Year

Fujian's Interplanted Crops Grow Well and Young Trees Grow Quickly

    (Our newspaper from Fuzhou, 3rd) Fujian is extensively utilizing forest land for intercropping with grain, achieving a double harvest of both forest and grain.

    This year, the intercropping area in Fujian Province has increased substantially. In over 1,800 communes, brigades, and state-run forest farms and "Wanbaoshan" professional teams responsible for nurturing over 4.44 million mu of forest land alone, more than 1.4 million mu have been intercropped with crops such as sweet potatoes, early rice, millet, sorghum, and corn. Currently, the majority of the intercropped young trees and interplanted crops are growing well. Early-planted intercropped sorghum and dry rice are already beginning to be harvested, yielding bumper crops. The She-run and team-run forest farms and professional teams of Yuanda Brigade of Meixian Commune in Longxi County, Zhongshan Brigade of Yanqian Commune in Sanming City, and others, have already harvested over 4,000 mu of intercropped crops such as corn, buckwheat, tartary buckwheat, and dry rice.

    According to the experiences of various localities in Fujian, implementing forest-grain intercropping can greatly promote the prosperity and development of the forest area economy. First, income is generated in the same year when forest land is intercropped. After Taiping Commune in Zhao'an County reclaimed and planted more than 60,000 mu of forest fruits and intercropped grain last year, it increased grain income by 180,000 catties in one year, increasing public accumulation and funds for developing "Wanbaoshan." Secondly, it can improve the survival rate of young trees and accelerate the growth and yield of timber forests and economic forests. According to existing experience in various localities, timber forests that are intercropped can generally mature five years earlier, and oil tea forests can flower and bear fruit two or three years earlier. In Dun Tou Brigade of Shangbaishi Commune in Fu'an County, intercropping was carried out in 19 mu of oil tea forest last year, costing only 12 more workdays per mu. As a result, the yield of oil tea increased two-fold compared to oil tea of the same soil quality and forest trees that were not intercropped, and a large amount of sweet potatoes and peanuts were also harvested. Thirdly, it can greatly save labor costs. After Beifeng Commune in Minhou County combined intercropping a large number of sweet potatoes with cultivation and weeding in forest land, the efficiency of nurturing young trees and expanding grain planting increased by more than 1.4 times. Fourthly, it promotes the development of a diversified economy in forest areas. For example, the communes in the Longyan area not only intercropped a large amount of grain and melons and vegetables in forest land, but also increased the raising of more than 25,000 domestic animals and poultry, enabling many bases to quickly achieve self-sufficiency in grain, meat, oil, and vegetables.

    湖南间作地超过千万亩比去年增一倍  福建间种地里庄稼生长好幼林成长快
    本报福州3日电　福建大量利用林地间种粮食，获得了林粮双丰收。
    福建省今年林地间种面积大量增加。仅在一千八百多个公社、大队和国家兴办的林场和“万宝山”专业队负责抚育的四百四十多万亩林地中，就已间种了甘薯、早稻、小米、高粱、玉米等作物一百四十多万亩。现在，林粮间作的幼林和间种作物绝大部分都生长良好。早种的间作高粱和旱稻等已经开始收获，获得丰收。龙溪县梅仙公社源大大队、三明市岩前公社忠山大队等社办、队办林场和专业队已收割四千多亩玉米、苦麦、荞麦、旱稻等间种作物。
    根据福建各地的经验，实行林粮间作可以大大促进林区经济的繁荣发展。第一，实行林地间种，当年就有收入。诏安县太平公社在去年开荒种植林果和间种粮食等六万多亩后，一年中就增加粮食收入十八万斤，增加了公共积累和开发“万宝山”的资金。其次，可以提高幼林成活率，加快林木和经济林的成长和产量。据各地已有的经验，实行林地间种的用材林，一般可提早五年成材，油茶林可提早二、三年开花结果。福安县上白石公社墩头大队，去年在十九亩油茶林中实行间种，每亩只多花十二个工，结果油茶产量比没有实行间种的同土质、同树林的油茶增加两倍，同时还多收了大量的甘薯和花生。第三，可以大大节省工本。闽侯县北峰公社在结合林地中耕除草间种大量甘薯后，使幼林抚育和扩种粮食功效提高一点四倍以上。第四，促进林区多种经济的发展。如龙岩专区各公社不但利用林地间种了大量的粮食和瓜菜，同时还增养了两万五千多头家畜家禽，使许多基地迅速实现了粮食、肉类、油料、蔬菜四自给。
