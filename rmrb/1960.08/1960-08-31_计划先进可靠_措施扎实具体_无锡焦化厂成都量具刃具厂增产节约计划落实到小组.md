Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch: Workers at the Wuxi Coking Plant in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, have formulated production increase and thrift plans and measures for the next four months and launched a production increase and thrift campaign.

During discussions on the production increase and thrift plan, the workers unanimously agreed that there have been three major improvements in the factory since the beginning of this year: First, a major increase in production. The total amount of coke produced by the factory from January to July increased by 78% compared with the same period last year. Second, a major improvement in ideology. The revolutionary will of all factory workers to adhere to the General Line is becoming stronger and their enthusiasm is growing, especially after the cadres went to the front line, living, eating, working, and consulting with the workers, a new situation of concerted effort throughout the factory has emerged. Third, a major increase in the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization and technical level. Through the technical revolution movement, heavy manual labor such as loading, unloading, transportation, and coke pushing has been replaced by machinery, and the technical barrier of using inferior coal and white coal to produce good coke has also been initially broken through.

After affirming the excellent current production situation, the workers put forward two major keys to the sustained leap forward in coke production: one is to increase the coal-to-coke conversion rate, and the other is to use a large amount of inferior coal and white coal for coking. In response to these two major keys, the workers also put forward two strong measures. The first is to strengthen the recovery of raw coal and reduce the loss of raw coal in various production links after entering the factory. The second is to vigorously carry out the technical revolution, promote advanced experiences, increase the coke output rate, and insist on using inferior coal to produce good coke. They have identified and vigorously promoted more than ten advanced experiences and innovation projects, such as preheating and drying the coal before it enters the furnace.

After the factory's production increase and thrift targets and measures were formulated, each workshop, ninety-four production groups, and many workers formulated specific targets and measures. From the factory to each group, production plans were formulated on a monthly, ten-day, and daily basis. This has built the production increase and thrift plan on a solid mass foundation.

While discussing the production increase and thrift plan, all factory workers immediately took action, launching a competition upsurge to produce more coke to support steel production. Workers in the third shift of Red Flag No. 2 furnace competed with each other. One day, the middle shift's output reached 49.9 tons. The night shift workers immediately chased after them, surpassing the middle shift with a score of 52 tons. Then, the morning shift workers created a new record of 53.3 tons per shift.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Dispatch: According to the current excellent situation and favorable conditions, the workers of the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory have formulated production increase and thrift plans for the next few months on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis, and have implemented the plans at all levels down to the team (group) and individual. At present, all factory workers have launched a production increase and thrift competition.

In the first seven months of this year, the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory completed and overfulfilled its plans for product output, quality, and variety; the cost was reduced by 14.6% compared with last year's actual performance. Recently, the factory Party committee led all factory workers to conscientiously summarize the production achievements and experiences of the first seven months of this year by branch factory, workshop, and team (group), and discussed and formulated production increase and thrift plans and specific measures for the next four months. In the process of formulating plans and measures, the workers and masses implemented the ideas of using advanced thinking to prepare plans, using advanced indicators to prepare plans, and using advanced measures to ensure the completion of plans, making the plans advanced and reliable and the measures concrete and practical. The tool branch factory's worker group in the hole generation workshop carefully analyzed the group's favorable conditions, and also fully estimated the group's many processes, few machine tools, and many apprentices, and decided to make the production in the next few months a big step forward without increasing materials, equipment, or manpower. Their measures are: tapping the potential of equipment; using the group's underutilized equipment to process products for brother groups; promoting multi-tool cutting experience on the hole generation cutting machine and improving process methods to shorten the work material that used to require five processes to cut to one process; promoting pneumatic chucks on lathes to replace manual operations and shorten auxiliary time; reforming product design to save materials; and vigorously developing comprehensive utilization and diversified operations, etc.

At present, the factory Party committee has transferred more than one hundred cadres to go deep into the front line of production to lead the development of the production increase and thrift campaign. All factory workers have launched various competitions. In the competition of "the night shift exceeding the day shift, and the day shift catching up with the night shift," group leaders and other cadres take turns on two shifts and fully prepare the materials, tools, technical data, and spare parts for mechanical repairs used by the night shift. The factory Party committee pays special attention to the rest and life of the night shift workers, so that the night shift workers have plenty of energy to carry out production. At present, the output of the night shift has exceeded the output of the day shift by about 15%.

### 计划先进可靠  措施扎实具体  无锡焦化厂成都量具刃具厂增产节约计划落实到小组

    计划先进可靠  措施扎实具体
    无锡焦化厂成都量具刃具厂增产节约计划落实到小组
    据新华社南京电　江苏无锡市无锡焦化厂职工订出今后四个多月的增产节约计划和措施，开展了增产节约运动。
    职工们在讨论增产节约计划中，一致认为今年以来厂内有三大提高：第一是生产大提高，全厂1月到7月生产的焦炭总量，比去年同期增长了78％。第二是思想大提高，全厂职工坚持贯彻总路线的革命意志越来越坚强，干劲越来越足，特别是干部深入第一线，和工人同吃同住同劳动同商量以后，出现了全厂上下一股劲的新局面。第三是机械化和半机械化程度和技术水平大提高，通过技术革命运动，装卸、运输、出焦等繁重的体力劳动已由机械代替，次煤和白煤炼好焦的技术关也初步突破。
    职工们在肯定当前生产的大好形势以后，提出了炼焦生产持续跃进的重大关键有两个：一个是提高原煤成焦率；另一个是大量使用次煤和白煤炼焦。针对这两大关键，职工们又提出了两项有力的措施。第一是加强原煤回收，降低原煤进厂后在各个生产环节上的损耗。第二是大搞技术革命，推广先进经验，提高出焦率，坚持用次煤炼好焦。他们排出了入炉煤预热干燥等十多项先进经验和革新项目，大力推广。
    全厂的增产节约指标和措施制订出来以后，各个车间、九十四个生产小组和许多工人，都订出了具体指标和措施。从全厂到各组，又按月按旬按日制订了生产计划。这样，就使增产节约计划建立在坚实的群众基础上。
    全厂职工一边讨论增产节约方案，一边立即行动，掀起了多产焦支援钢铁生产的竞赛热潮。红旗二号炉三班工人互相竞赛，有一天，中班的产量达到四十九点九吨，夜班工人立即追赶，以五十二吨的成绩赶过中班；接着，早班工人又创造班产五十三点三吨的新成绩。
    据新华社成都电　成都量具刃具厂职工根据当前大好形势和有利条件，逐日、逐旬、逐月地制订出今后几个月的增产节约计划，并把计划层层落实到班（组）和个人。目前全厂职工已掀起了增产节约竞赛。
    成都量具刃具厂今年前七个月的产品产量、质量、品种都完成和超额完成了计划；成本比去年的实绩降低了14.6％。最近，工厂党委领导全厂职工，以分厂、车间、班（组）为单位，认真总结了今年前七个月的生产成就和经验，讨论制订了今后四个多月的增产节约计划和具体措施。在制订计划和措施中，职工群众贯彻了用先进思想编制计划、用先进指标编制计划、用先进措施确保完成计划的思想，使计划先进可靠，措施扎实具体。刃具分厂代孔车间车工组，认真分析了本组的有利条件，也充分估计了本组工序较多、机床少、徒工多等情况，决定在不增加材料、设备、人力的情况下，使今后几个月的生产再大大提高一步。他们的措施是：挖掘设备潜力；利用本组利用率不高的设备，为兄弟小组加工产品；在代孔切断机上推广多刀切削经验，改进工艺方法，把过去要经过五道工序才能切下的工作料缩短为一道工序完成；在车床上推广风动夹头，代替手工操作，缩短辅助时间；改革产品设计，节约材料；大搞综合利用、多种经营等等。
    目前，工厂党委已抽调了一百多干部，深入生产第一线，领导增产节约运动的开展。全厂职工掀起了各种各样的竞赛。在“夜班超白班，白班赶夜班”的竞赛中，小组长等干部分两班轮流值班，并且充分做好夜班使用的材料、工卡具、技术资料和机械修理用的备件等的准备工作。工厂党委特别关心夜班工人的休息和生活，使夜班职工有充沛的精力进行生产。目前夜班产量已经超过白班产量15％左右。
