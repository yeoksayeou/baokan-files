Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th—The graduating students of the Performance and Stage Art Departments of the Shanghai Theatre Academy, changing the traditional practice of staging classical masterpieces as their graduation performance, took large and small programs with modern themes to the Fujian front for a two-and-a-half-month performance tour. This enabled the students to achieve great success in political thought, literary and artistic thought, and creative work.

In March of this year, the academy's Party committee, in resolutely implementing the Party's education and literary and artistic policies, decided that the graduation performance of these two departments' graduating students would be a performance tour to the front. The students traveled from northeastern Fujian to southern Fujian, from coastal cities to frontline positions, enduring arduous journeys and performing continuously for seventy-nine days, a total of one hundred and eighty-two performances, and conducted four hundred and fifty medium and small-scale outreach activities.

These graduates carried forward the revolutionary tradition of the military cultural troupes, doing everything possible to perform for the soldiers. In order to ensure that every soldier could see their performances, sometimes more than forty students would perform two large plays simultaneously. When there were not enough actors, one person would take on several roles. They performed for thousands of spectators and, sometimes, walked more than ten miles to perform for a single sentry guarding the motherland's coast. When it was impossible to go, the students would sing a folk song from the soldier's hometown or tell a crosstalk over the phone. At this time, the soldiers' excited voices would be heard over the phone: "Dear ones, thank you!" The students knew that the cooks were the busiest and saw the fewest performances. Every time they arrived at a place, some students would go to the kitchen to cook for the People's Liberation Army, so that the cooks could watch the performances without worry. Once, the students learned that there were also our soldiers on a mountain top more than six hundred meters high, who rarely came down to see performances. In the past, when outreach groups came, they often only sent one or two people up to perform. This time, the teachers and students decided to put on the most formal performance on the mountain. They carried sets and props, laboriously climbed to the top of the mountain. Although there were only a few spectators, the students treated them as if they were ten thousand, a million spectators, and performed two plays seriously: "Ordinary Work" and "An Unstoppable Force," as well as some musical and dance programs. The soldiers were deeply moved.

The students not only performed on the front, but also used all their time to participate in labor, washing clothes and quilts for the soldiers, polishing shoes, mending clothes, or helping to repair roads and fortifications, going down to the companies to be soldiers, and persevering in training and transformation. In the seventy days on the front, they worked tirelessly in outreach, performances, labor, and service. In the two and a half months, they performed in twelve cities. Everyone was wholeheartedly immersed in the army. The leaders of the troops happily said, "Thank you to the Party for cultivating our own intellectuals and actors. Proletarian literature and art are blossoming and bearing fruit."

Through this performance tour, the greatest gain for teachers and students was the further transformation of literary and artistic thought. They began to understand how to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, specifically understood what the criteria for judging literature and art are, and personally experienced the role and power of literary and artistic weapons. When they first performed in Fuzhou, the students staged large multi-act plays such as "Nameless Island" and "The Barren Tree Sprouts," but dared not stage small plays. They thought that only these large plays could represent "academy level." Male students were unwilling to sing the song "Why is it Honorable to be a Soldier," thinking that the lyrics were "sloganized" and the melody "monotonous," unable to sing out "level." After the outreach group's Party organization discovered these situations, it immediately organized students to discuss and encouraged them to perform those programs that they thought were "unsuccessful" due to bourgeois ideas. Facts proved that these programs were precisely what the soldiers loved. Once, when singing "Why is it Honorable to be a Soldier" for a sentry on duty at the front, when the students sang: "Why is it honorable to be a soldier, honorable because the responsibility is heavy, hold the gun tight, keep your eyes peeled, defend the great rivers and mountains, defend 600 million people, defend socialism,..." The soldier's eyes stared into the distance, but tears of excitement and gratitude gradually flowed down, tightly holding the singer's hand. At this time, the students realized the great power of this song. These facts made the teachers and students understand that only by better representing the people can literature and art have meaning. The teachers and students also specifically realized from this that politics is the first criterion for measuring literature and art, and that only with the feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers can one perform well in plays and sing well. They deeply realized that Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art, is the only correct direction.

During the seventy-odd days of the performance tour, due to going deep into life and becoming familiar with life, teachers and students created a large number of works, including multi-act plays, one-act plays, living newspapers, storytelling, and songs.

### 体现毛泽东文艺思想  贯彻为工农兵服务方向  上海戏剧学院毕业生到福建前线慰问演出  获得了政治思想、文艺思想和创作方面的大丰收

    体现毛泽东文艺思想  贯彻为工农兵服务方向
    上海戏剧学院毕业生到福建前线慰问演出
    获得了政治思想、文艺思想和创作方面的大丰收
    据新华社上海6日电　上海戏剧学院表演系、舞台美术系的应届毕业生，改变过去毕业班以排演古典名著作为毕业公演的传统习惯，他们带着现代题材的大、小节目，到福建前线去作两个半月的慰问演出，使学生们在政治思想、文艺思想以及创作方面，都获得了巨大的丰收。
    今年3月，学院的党委在坚决贯彻执行党的教育方针和文艺方针中，决定这两个系的应届毕业生以到前线去慰问演出作为毕业公演。学生们从闽东北到闽南，从沿海的城市到前沿阵地，跋山涉水，连续慰问演出七十九天，共演了一百八十二场，并进行了中、小型慰问活动四百五十次。
    这些毕业生发扬了部队文工团的革命传统，千方百计为战士们演出。为了争取让每个战士都看到他们的戏，有时四十多个学生同时上演两台大戏，演员不够，就一个人担负演几个角色。他们既为几千观众演出，有时步行十数里，也为一位坚守在祖国海岸上的哨兵演出。实在没法去的地方，学生便在电话里为战士演唱一个战士们喜爱的家乡民歌，或者说一个相声。这时候电话里就传来了战士们激动的声音：
  “亲人们，谢谢！”学生们知道炊事员的工作最忙，戏看得最少，每到一地，都有一些学生下厨房为解放军烧饭煮菜，让炊事员安心去看演出。有一次，学生们知道了在附近六百米以上的山顶上也有我们的战士，他们很少下山看戏，过去慰问团来的时候，常常只派一两个人上去演出，这次师生们决定上山去作一次最正规的演出，他们背着布景道具，艰难地爬到山顶，尽管观众只有几个人，可是学生们把他们当作十万、百万观众一样，认真地演了两个戏：“平凡的工作”和“关不住的一股劲”，和一些音乐舞蹈节目，战士们深深地受到感动。
    学生们不仅在前线演出，还利用一切时间参加劳动，为战士们洗衣，洗被，擦皮鞋，补衣服，或者帮助修路、修工事，下连队当兵，坚持不懈地进行锻炼改造。在前线七十多天中，他们废寝忘食地慰问、演出，劳动、服务。在两个半月的时间内，他们曾经在十二个城市作了演出，大家一心深入部队，部队的首长高兴地说：“感谢党培养出了我们自己的知识分子和演员，无产阶级的文艺开花结果了。”
    通过这次慰问演出，师生得到最大的收获是文艺思想的进一步转变。他们开始懂得了如何去为工农兵服务，具体地认识了什么是评判文艺的标准，亲身体会到了文艺武器的作用和威力。当在福州第一次慰问演出的时候，学生们上演了“无名岛”和“枯木逢春”等大型的多幕舞台剧，但是不敢上演小戏，他们思想上认为唯有这几台大戏才能代表“学院水平”。男学生中不愿意唱“当兵为什么光荣”这一首歌曲，认为这首歌词“口号化”，旋律“单调”，唱不出“水平”。慰问团的党组织发现这些情况后，立即组织学生们进行讨论，并鼓励他们去演出那些因资产阶级思想作祟而认为“打不响”的节目，事实证明，这些节目正是战士们所喜爱的。有一次，在前沿阵地为一位值勤的哨兵演唱“当兵为什么光荣”歌曲时，当学生们唱到：“当兵为什么光荣，光荣因为责任重，握紧枪杆，擦亮眼睛，保卫万里江山，保卫六亿人民，保卫社会主义，……”。战士的眼睛盯着远方，可是渐渐地流下了兴奋和感激的眼泪，紧紧地握着演唱者的手，这时候学生们才觉察了这首歌产生的巨大力量。这些事实，使师生们懂得了只有更好地表现人民群众，文艺才有意义。师生们从中也具体地认识了政治是衡量文艺的第一标准，有了工农兵的感情才能演好戏、唱好歌。他们深深体会到毛泽东文艺思想，文艺为工农兵服务是唯一的正确方向。
    在七十多天慰问演出中，由于深入生活，熟悉生活，师生们创作出了大量作品，其中包括有多幕剧、独幕剧、活报、说唱、歌曲等。
