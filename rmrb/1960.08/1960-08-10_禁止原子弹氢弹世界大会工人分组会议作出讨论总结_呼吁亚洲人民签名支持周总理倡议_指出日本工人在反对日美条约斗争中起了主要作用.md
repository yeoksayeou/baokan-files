Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The workers' group meeting of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament unanimously adopted a summary of discussions, expressing support for the peace initiative proposed by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to build Asia and the Pacific region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. The summary also calls on the people of Asian countries to unite and launch a signature campaign to support Premier Zhou's proposal.

There were 1,700 Japanese trade union representatives and 18 foreign representatives attending the workers' group meeting. The main issue discussed at the meeting was the contribution of Japanese workers to the cause of world peace. The meeting also discussed how Japanese workers can contribute to the establishment of a united front and how the Japanese people, with workers as the core, can further develop the struggle to abolish the new "Security Treaty."

Almost all speakers participating in the discussion emphasized the fact that the U.S. imperialists are the enemies of peace and the enemies of the people of all countries in the world. A worker from Kyoto said that the workers at his workplace clearly understand that U.S. imperialists are the enemies of the Japanese people. He said, "We realized this in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. U.S. imperialists are endangering peace and exploiting the Japanese people." He mentioned that the reason why the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty" has won the support of the people of all countries in the world is mainly because they are fighting against the common enemy of the people of all countries in the world, U.S. imperialism. His words were met with thunderous applause.

Many representatives pointed out that the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs should be closely integrated with the movement to abolish the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Many speakers at the meeting emphasized that workers played a major role in forming a united front with peasants.

Many representatives also emphasized that the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, as the core of the united front, must cooperate.

Many people also condemned the Japanese reactionaries' attempts to split the current anti-nuclear weapons movement in their speeches.

The foreign representatives participating in the meeting expressed their support for the just and patriotic struggle of the Japanese people and emphasized the unity of the working class of all countries in striving for world peace.

The discussion summary made at the meeting confirmed with satisfaction that Japanese workers played a major role in the struggle against the new "Security Treaty." The summary emphasized that "workers should unite people from all walks of life around the cause upheld by the working class and must quickly strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialists and Japanese monopoly capital—both of whom are fierce enemies of peace."

The summary also suggested strengthening support for the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. military bases.

    呼吁亚洲人民签名支持周总理倡议
    指出日本工人在反对日美条约斗争中起了主要作用
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的工人分组会议一致作出讨论总结，表示支持中国总理周恩来提出的把亚洲和太平洋地区建成无核武器地区的和平倡议。总结并且呼吁亚洲各国人民联合起来，展开签名运动，来支持周总理的这个建议。
    出席工人分组会议的有一千七百名日本工会代表和十八名外国代表。会议讨论的主要问题是日本工人对世界和平事业的贡献。会议同时讨论了日本工人如何为建立统一战线作出贡献以及日本人民怎样以工人为核心进一步发展争取废除新“安全条约”的斗争的问题。
    参加讨论的发言人几乎一致强调这一事实：美帝国主义者是和平的敌人，也是世界各国人民的敌人。京都的一名工人说，他的工作场所的工人都清楚地了解到，美帝国主义者是日本人民的敌人。他说：“这一点是我们在反对美日军事同盟条约斗争的过程中认识到的。美帝国主义者正在危害和平和剥削日本人民”。他谈到日本人民反对“安全条约”的斗争所以赢得世界各国人民的支持，主要是因为他们是在同世界各国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义进行斗争。他的这番话博得了雷鸣般的掌声。
    许多代表指出，反对原子弹和氢弹的运动，应该同争取废除新日美“安全条约”的运动紧密地结合起来。许多在会上发言的人强调指出在同农民结成统一战线方面，工人起了主要的作用。
    不少代表还强调指出，作为统一战线的核心的社会党和共产党必须合作。
    还有许多人在发言中谴责了日本反动派企图分裂当前的反对核武器运动的阴谋。
    参加会议的外国代表，表示支持日本人民的正义爱国斗争，并且强调各国工人阶级团结起来争取世界和平。
    会上作出的讨论总结，满意地确认，日本工人在反对新“安全条约”的斗争中起了主要作用。总结强调指出，“工人们应当把各阶层人民团结在工人阶级所维护的事业的周围，并必须迅速加强反对美帝国主义者和日本垄断资本——两者都是和平的凶恶敌人——的斗争。”
    总结并且建议加强支持日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争。
