    Supporting Coal Mine Production Increase
    Under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, all sectors of Xuzhou City have launched a surge in support of coal production. In addition to actively rushing to produce mechanical equipment, the factories of the Mechanical Industry Bureau have also dispatched manpower to the mines to repair equipment. The electricity department is carrying out electricity conservation to ensure that 56% to 60% of the city's electricity is used for coal production. Transportation, commerce, and health departments are also doing everything possible to serve coal production. While all sectors support coal mine production, the coal mines are also vigorously strengthening logistical work, implementing measures such as clearing warehouses, taking stock, and cleaning up idle equipment awaiting repair, to ensure sustained high coal production through internal and external coordination.

    Increased Crushed Coke Transportation Volume
    Workers at the Kaili Coal Mine Coking Plant in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture of Guizhou improved the method of coke loading and transportation to provide sufficient "food" for increasing steel production. They crushed and screened large pieces of coke according to the furnace granularity standard, removing coke powder and inferior coke before loading and transporting it. This method not only improves the quality of coke leaving the plant and reduces the loss of coke during transportation, but also increases the transportation volume of each vehicle by about 20%.

    Breaking Through the Mine Transportation Bottleneck
    The Tonghua Sifangshan Iron Mine in Jilin mobilized the masses to overcome the mine transportation bottleneck. On the 25-kilometer-long mine transportation line, they used indigenous methods to assemble a continuous line for ore crushing and loading without power, basically realizing the mechanization of ore crushing, transportation, and loading. This greatly improved loading efficiency, increasing the daily ore transportation volume by three and a half times, and saving 90% of loading and transportation labor, fundamentally changing the phenomenon of vehicle idleness.

    Concentrating Efforts to Guarantee Key Projects
    In order to ensure the production of supporting standard parts needed for grain and steel production increases, the workers of the Dalian Standard Parts Factory launched a "Four Checks" campaign to fully ensure key projects. This included checking the quantity of products, checking the quality of products, checking the contract execution status, and checking the completeness of products. They took action while checking, resolving all the problems found, so that many key standard parts were completed on schedule, in quantity, and in complete sets. They are now studying and arranging the tasks for the next five months, and have decided that the production of supporting standard parts needed for grain and steel will be given priority.

    Seven Years of Safe Driving
    The Feng Bin group of the Fourth Transportation Team of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Transportation has driven safely for more than 2.31 million kilometers in more than seven years, without any accidents, large or small, and has overfulfilled the state plan ahead of schedule every year. This year, they have achieved 10,000-ton-kilometers per vehicle ton per month for five consecutive months, overfulfilling the state-assigned annual transportation plan 198 days ahead of schedule, becoming a model for high-yield and safe driving in the province.

    High Efficiency of "Side-Job" Processing
    Lin Zhiming, a worker in the mechanical workshop of the Dalian Locomotive Factory, created an advanced experience of "side-job" processing, which greatly improved production efficiency without increasing personnel or equipment. This processing method involves using the excess capacity of the planer to process two kinds of work at the same time, increasing the production volume by an average of 50%, so that two planers can do the work of three. More than 50% of the planers in the entire workshop have now promoted this experience, and all have achieved good results.

    要闻快报
    支援煤矿增产
    徐州市各行各业在市委的统一领导下，掀起了支援煤炭生产的热潮。机械工业局各厂除积极赶制机械设备外，还抽出人力下矿检修设备；电业部门开展节约用电，保证全市电力的百分之五十六到百分之六十用于煤炭生产。交通运输部门、商业和卫生部门也都千方百计地为煤炭生产服务。在各行各业支援煤矿生产的同时，各煤矿也大力加强后勤工作，实行清仓盘库、清理停用待修设备等措施，做到内外结合，保证煤炭持续高产。
    碎焦运输运量提高
    贵州黔东南苗族侗族自治州凯里煤矿炼焦场职工，为了给钢铁增产供应充足的“粮食”，改进了焦炭装运方法，将大块焦炭按入炉粒度标准打碎、筛选，除去焦粉和劣焦后再装车外运。采取这种办法，不仅提高了出场焦炭质量，减少焦炭在运输中的损耗，而且每辆车的运输量可提高百分之二十左右。
    攻破矿内运输关
    吉林通化四方山铁矿发动群众，猛攻矿内运输关，在二十五公里长的矿内运输线上，用土办法，装成无动力捣矿、装车连续线，基本上实现了捣矿、运输、装车机械化，大大提高了装车效率，矿石日运量提高三倍半，而且节省了装运劳动力百分之九十，从根本上改变了车辆窝工现象。
    集中力量保证重点
    大连标准件厂职工为了保证粮、钢增产所需要的配套标准件的生产，在全厂掀起了一个全力保重点的“四查”运动，即查产品数量、查产品质量、查合同执行情况、查产品成套情况，并且边检查边行动，把查出来的问题全部作了处理，使许多重点标准件都按期、按量、按套地完成了任务。目前他们又对今后五个月的任务进行了研究和安排，决定凡是粮、钢所需要的配套标准件，都要优先安排生产。
    七年安全行车
    青海省交通厅汽车四队冯斌小组，七年多来安全行车二百三十一万多公里，从未发生大小事故，并且年年提前超额完成国家计划。今年又连续五个月实现了车吨月产万吨公里，提前一百九十八天超额完成了国家下达的全年运输计划，成为全省高产安全行车的标兵。
    “捎脚”加工效率高
    大连机车厂机械车间工人林治明，创造了一种“捎脚”加工的先进经验，在增产不增人和不增加设备的条件下，大大提高了生产效率。这种加工办法，就是利用刨床的多余能力，同时加工两种活，使生产量平均增长百分之五十，两台刨床就可以顶三台用。现在全车间已有百分之五十以上的刨床推广了这个经验，都收到了良好的效果。
