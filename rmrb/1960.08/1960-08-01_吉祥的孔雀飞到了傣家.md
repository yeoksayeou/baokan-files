The border defense soldiers of the Meng Han District in Yunnan Province, who are responsible for guarding the border, not only helped the fraternal ethnic groups to stand up and become masters of their own destiny, but also helped them develop production and continuously improve their material and cultural living standards. The leaders of the troops personally cultivated experimental fields, introduced new agricultural techniques to the fraternal ethnic groups, and launched a movement to reform agricultural production techniques among the Dai compatriots, changing the past crude farming methods such as planting without fertilizer and plowing no more than three inches deep. Since 1958, there have been bumper harvests every year. In just two years, cattle and sheep are now in herds, pigs are in pens, and the fragrance of vegetables and fruits fills the air. The Dai compatriots are so kind and infinitely trusting of the border defense soldiers that praises like these can be heard everywhere: "Chairman Mao has sent us such good troops!", "Auspicious peacocks have flown to the Dai people!", "The life of the Dai people has changed!..." (Attached picture)

	Now every commune owns various new agricultural tools. This is a scene of border defense soldiers helping Dai compatriots thresh in the fields.

	With the help of the border defense comrades, the first machine-made sugar factory has been built here.

	Political Instructor Zhao Tianyou often carefully helps cadres from fraternal ethnic groups solve difficulties in their work. He is currently studying work with Bo Paxiu (center), the township head of Jingha Township, and Mi Paxiu (right), the commune head of Jingha Commune.

    吉祥的孔雀飞到了傣家
    云南勐罕区担负守卫边疆任务的边防军战士们，不仅帮助兄弟民族翻身作主人，而且帮助他们发展生产，不断地提高物质、文化、生活水平。部队的首长亲自种试验田，向兄弟民族介绍新的农业技术，发动傣族同胞开展革新农业生产技术的运动，改变了过去人们种地不施肥、耕深不过三寸等粗放的耕种方法。自1958年以来，年年农业大丰收。不过两年的时间，现在已是牛羊成群猪满圈，蔬菜瓜果扑鼻香了。傣族同胞对边防军战士是那样的亲切和无限信任，到处可以听到这样的赞颂：“毛主席给我们派来了多么好的军队啊！”、“傣族飞来了吉祥的孔雀！傣家生活变了样！……”（附图片）
    现在社社都拥有各种新式农具。这是边防军战士帮助傣族同胞在地里打场。
    在边防军同志的帮助下，这里建起了第一个机器制糖厂。
    教导员赵天有经常细心地帮助兄弟民族干部解决工作中的困难。他正在与景哈乡乡长波帕秀（中）和景哈社社长密帕秀（右）研究工作。　　　杜心摄（解放军画报社供稿）
