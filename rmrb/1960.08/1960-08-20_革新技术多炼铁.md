    Technological Innovation Leads to More Iron Smelting
    All the staff of our No. 2 blast furnace warmly respond to the call of the Party Central Committee to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy. We are determined to work hard for more than four months, to complete and overfulfill the annual pig iron production plan ahead of schedule.
    Since the beginning of this year, we have broken superstitions, liberated our minds, made great reforms in air supply and hot blast stove operation, and improved blast furnace operation, reducing the particle size of ore. As a result, the smelting intensity of the blast furnace has increased from 1.2 to 1.6. In the first seven months of this year, pig iron production overfulfilled the plan by 5.31%, the quality qualification rate reached 99.94%, and the coke consumption per ton of pig iron decreased by 3.2% compared with the same period last year.
    In the current campaign to increase production and practice economy, we must first seize the two months of August and September. Every day and every shift, we must formulate specific measures based on changes in production conditions, and adjust the furnace conditions in time from the operation to strive for a substantial increase in production.
    All the workers in our furnace are determined to continue to vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, and promote effective advanced experience. This is a key link in increasing production and practicing economy. Each shift must also implement the "four exchanges" system of exchanging equipment conditions, raw material conditions, operating indicators, and technical analysis. We are determined to achieve greater success in terms of blast furnace utilization coefficient, reduction of coke ratio, improvement of quality, and safe production, not only to overfulfill the state plan, but also to strive to become an advanced blast furnace in the country.

    革新技术多炼铁
    我们二号高炉全体职工热烈响应党中央关于开展增产节约运动的号召，决心大干猛干四个多月，提前和超额完成全年的生铁生产计划。
    今年以来，我们破除迷信，解放思想，在送风、热风炉操作方面作了很大改革，并且改进了高炉操作，缩小了矿石的粒度，结果高炉的冶炼强度由一点二提高到一点六。今年头七个月，生铁产量超额5.31％完成了计划，质量合格率达到99.94％，每吨生铁的焦炭消耗比去年同期降低了3.2％。
    在当前的增产节约运动中，我们首先要抓紧8、9两个月。我们每天每班都要根据生产情况的变化，制订具体措施，及时从操作上调剂炉况，力争大幅度地增产。
    我们全炉工人决心继续大闹技术革新和技术革命，推广行之有效的先进经验。这是增产节约的一个关键环节。每班还要实行交设备情况、原料情况、操作指标和技术分析的“四交”制度。我们决心在高炉的利用系数、降低焦比、提高质量、安全生产等方面取得更大的成绩，不仅要超额完成国家计划，而且要争取成为国内的先进高炉。
