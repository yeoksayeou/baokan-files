Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 24th: The Japanese newspaper "Akahata" recently published a report by Kenji Miyamoto, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, at the recent JCP National Activists Conference.

He said that on August 1st, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, at a reception on Swiss National Day, suggested that Asian and Pacific Rim countries, including the United States, sign a treaty of mutual non-aggression and peace, turning the entire region into a nuclear-free zone. This event, aimed at the imperialists' counter-propaganda claiming that China does not want peaceful coexistence, proved to the world that while the People's Republic of China is adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence by signing a series of treaties of peace and friendship with Asian countries, it is also putting forward positive suggestions for Asian peace.

Miyamoto first discussed the international situation in his report. He said, "Our Communist Party is in complete agreement with the analysis in the Moscow Declaration, and has always believed that the nature of US imperialism has not changed."

"The development of the international and domestic situation has confirmed that our party's views are completely correct." He pointed out that the reason the United States continues to pursue a policy of aggression on the one hand, while adopting a posture of agreeing to talks on the other, is because:

First, the peace policy of socialist countries is increasingly supported by the broad masses, especially as the Soviet Union has the upper hand of US imperialism both militarily and scientifically.

Second, the struggle of the people of the world against colonialism and war is rising day by day. As shown by the liberation struggle in Cuba, the national liberation and peace forces of the world have made progress.

Third, the position of the United States has weakened relatively internationally, and at the same time, the contradictions within the imperialist camp, such as the contradictions between Britain and the United States, have also deepened.

These changes in the balance of power and their internal contradictions are the main reasons why US imperialism, while fundamentally continuing to adopt a policy of war and aggression, had to take the opportunity of Khrushchev's visit to the United States to express its agreement to hold a summit meeting.

Miyamoto emphasized, "However, as long as they are imperialists, they will continue to adopt a policy of aggression and war. In response to this situation, the people of all countries are continuing their struggle for peace and independence, against the cold war policy of the imperialists, with increasing tenacity. Although our people have not yet achieved complete victory, they have already dealt a great blow to two enemies in this struggle. Needless to say, this has also made a great contribution to world peace."

Miyamoto said that while the struggle of the people of all countries has made progress, socialist countries have consistently continued to adopt a policy of peace after the summit meeting failed to materialize. On June 3, the Soviet government once again put forward a new proposal on complete disarmament.

He pointed out that the world's peace forces, while clearly pointing out the enemies of peace, are also strengthening the unity of the world's peace forces based on a strong confidence in being able to win peace.

He said that it can be said that in the struggle against the "Security Treaty," while clearly recognizing that US imperialism is the center of reactionary forces in the world (as the Moscow Declaration also states), we have consistently continued to fight for peace and independence, and together with the Japanese people, have made great contributions to world peace as well as Japan's independence and freedom.

Miyamoto emphasized that it is necessary to protect Marxism-Leninism as we protect our eyes, maintain the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and develop it.

Therefore, we believe that while vigorously supporting the world communist movement to strengthen unity and move forward in the direction of the Moscow Declaration, we have a responsibility to do our best for the creative development of Marxism-Leninism in Japan and the liberation of the Japanese people on the basis of this mutual unity.

Miyamoto said that the international situation shows that the constantly growing socialist camp, peace forces, national liberation forces, and people's democratic forces are strengthening day by day; conversely, the contradictions within the imperialist camp are becoming increasingly acute, and although its policy of aggression is bankrupt, it still regards the Cold War as the supreme requirement, stubbornly clinging to the Cold War and challenging the direction of human progress and peace. However, they will never achieve victory in the future, and because they run counter to the progressive trend in the world, they will eventually fail all over the world, in every country.

Miyamoto then talked about domestic issues in Japan. He analyzed the essence of the Ikeda government and its mission.

Miyamoto pointed out that in view of the experience and failure of the Kishi cabinet, the Ikeda cabinet is currently adopting slightly different methods from the Kishi cabinet, but while recognizing its essence, we must clearly distinguish its tactical characteristics. Judging from the few policies already stated by the Ikeda cabinet, its mission is obviously first and foremost to actively implement the US-Japan military alliance treaty.

Miyamoto pointed out that the so-called 100 billion yen of social security funds and doubling national income, etc., are slogans for "stabilizing" the people's lives, and the expression of not revising the Police Duties Law and other series of "harmonious administration" are merely to disguise its essence as a militarist cabinet that is loyal to US imperialism and serves Japanese monopoly capital. This can also be clearly seen from the brutal attacks it launched on the people regarding the so-called Hagerty issue.

Miyamoto pointed out that, generally speaking, the purpose of the Ikeda cabinet is to cool down the rising struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and defend democracy, and to create blows and splits in the fighting and leading sections of the democratic movement. Miyamoto pointed out that, in essence, the Ikeda cabinet is more loyal than the Kishi cabinet in reviving imperialism and militarism, and we must regard it as a more cunning representative pawn of monopoly capital and make every effort to fight against it.

Miyamoto pointed out that the Ikeda cabinet uses the current economic boom in Japan—the state of capital accumulation caused by the thorough exploitation, usurpation, and forced industrial rationalization of the working class and the people—as a means of deceiving the Japanese people. While further increasing capital accumulation, the Ikeda cabinet attempts to actively lead American capital into Japan through trade and foreign exchange liberalization, which is their important line. Miyamoto pointed out that, however, the Japanese economy is already showing signs of overproduction. Although the Ikeda government wants to use trade and foreign exchange liberalization and strengthening US-Japan economic cooperation as means to solve the intensified market problems, this method will inevitably lead to promoting the strengthening of exploitation policies at home and imperialist intrusion into Southeast Asia, and at the same time, it will inevitably strengthen the dual exploitation of the Japanese people by US-Japan monopoly capital through the means of concentrating and strengthening monopoly capital and allowing American capital to control Japan's basic industries. Miyamoto emphasized that the central task of the Japanese people's future struggle must be to combine the goal of the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," as indicated by the struggle for independence, peace, and neutrality, with the struggle against the exploitation of US imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital and defending the lives of the Japanese people.

Miyamoto proposed the current common program of Japanese democratic forces in his report: not recognizing and abolishing the new "Security Treaty," crushing the US-Japan military alliance, restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China, defending the lives of people of all strata, and finally establishing a democratic coalition government.

He called on all Japanese democratic forces to strengthen the united front and fight for the realization of these common demands.

At the JCP National Activists Conference, JCP Chairman Nosaka Sanzo delivered the opening speech. Also speaking at the meeting were Organization Minister Matsushima Harushige, Culture Minister Kurahara Korehito, Peace and Base Countermeasures Minister Kamiyama Shigeo, and JCP Diet member group leader Shiga Yoshio, as well as heads of other departments.

General Secretary Miyamoto Kenji finally made a summary of the meeting.

### 世界和平力量满怀信心反对和平的敌人

    宫本显治在日共全国积极分子会议上作报告
    世界和平力量满怀信心反对和平的敌人
    周总理的和平倡议证明中国真诚关心亚洲和平　日本人民为世界和平作了很大贡献美帝国主义是全世界反动势力的中心　帝国主义侵略政策正在破产但仍不放弃冷战
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本“赤旗报”最近刊登了日本共产党总书记宫本显治在最近举行的日共全国积极分子会议上作的报告。
    他说，8月1日，中国的周恩来总理在瑞士国庆日招待会上建议亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，把这整个地区建成为没有核武器的地区。这件事情，针对帝国主义者说什么中国不想和平共处的反宣传，向全世界证明：中华人民共和国在与亚洲各国签订了一系列的和平友好条约，正在奉行和平共处五项原则的同时，还提出为了亚洲和平的积极的建议。
    宫本在他的报告中首先谈到国际形势问题。他说，“我们共产党同莫斯科宣言的分析完全一致，一向认为美帝国主义的本质并没有变。”
    “国际形势和国内形势的发展证实了我们党的这些看法完全正确。”他指出，美国所以一面继续执行侵略政策，另一面又采取同意会谈的姿态，是因为：
    第一，社会主义各国的和平政策越来越得到广大群众的支持，特别是苏联无论在军事上或者在科学上都占了美帝国主义的上风。
    第二，世界各国人民反对殖民主义和战争的斗争一天比一天高涨。正如古巴的解放斗争所显示的那样，全世界的民族解放和和平的力量有了进展。
    第三，美国的地位在国际上相对地削弱了，同时，帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾，譬如英美间的矛盾也加深了。
    力量对比的这些变化和它们内部的矛盾，是美帝国主义一面在根本上继续采取战争和侵略政策，一面不得不借赫鲁晓夫访美的机会表示总算同意举行首脑会议的主要原因。
    宫本强调指出，“但是，只要他们一天是帝国主义者就一天也要继续采取侵略和战争的政策。针对这种情况，各国人民正在越来越坚韧地继续进行争取和平和独立的斗争，反对帝国主义者的冷战政策。我国人民虽然还没有取得全面的胜利，可是，已经在这场斗争中给两个敌人以很大的打击。不消说，这对世界和平也作了很大的贡献。”
    宫本说，在各国人民斗争获得进展的同时，社会主义各国在首脑会议没有开成以后仍然一贯继续采取和平政策。苏联政府6月3日再次提出关于全面裁军的新建议。
    他指出，世界的和平力量在明确指出和平的敌人的同时，还根据能够赢得和平的坚强信心，正在加强世界和平力量的团结。
    他说，可以说，我们在反对“安全条约”的斗争中一面清清楚楚地认识到美帝国主义是全世界反动势力的中心（莫斯科宣言也说明了这一点），一面一贯继续进行争取和平和独立的斗争，和日本人民一道，对世界和平以及日本的独立和自由作了很大的贡献。
    宫本强调说，必须像保卫眼睛那样去保卫马克思列宁主义，维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，并且加以发展。
    因此，我们认为，我们在大力支持世界共产主义运动朝着莫斯科宣言的路线的方向加强团结、向前发展的同时，有责任在这种互相团结的基础上，为马列主义在日本的创造性的发展和日本人民的解放而竭尽全力。
    宫本说，国际形势所显示的是：不断壮大的社会主义阵营、和平力量、民族解放力量、人民的民主力量正在一天天加强；相反地，帝国主义阵营矛盾日趋尖锐，尽管它的侵略政策正在破产，但是它仍然把冷战作为至高无上的要求，死抱着冷战不放，向人类进步与和平的方向挑战。但是，他们将来决不会取得胜利，由于他们同世界上的进步潮流背道而驰，一定终于在全世界，在各个国家里失败。
    宫本接着谈到了日本国内的问题。他分析了池田政府的本质和它的使命。
    宫本指出，鉴于岸内阁的经验和失败，池田内阁目前采取与岸内阁稍为不同的手法，但我们在认清它的本质的同时必须把它的战术特点分辨清楚。仅从池田内阁已经表明的若干政策来看，显然它的使命首先在于积极实施日美军事同盟条约。
    宫本指出，所谓一千亿日元的社会保障费和使国民所得增加一倍等为“安定”国民生活的口号以及表明不修改警职法等一系列“融和行政”，不过是为了伪装它忠实于美帝国主义、侍奉日本垄断资本的军国主义内阁的本质而已。从它就所谓哈格蒂问题对人民所发动的凶暴攻击也能够清楚地看出这一点。
    宫本指出，总的来说，池田内阁的目的在于冷却高涨起来的阻止修改“安全条约”和维护民主的斗争，给民主运动的战斗性部分和领导部分造成打击和分裂。宫本指出，在本质上，池田内阁在复活帝国主义和军国主义方面比岸内阁更加忠实，我们必须把它看成是更加狡猾的垄断资本的代表性的走卒，举全力来同它进行斗争。
    宫本指出，池田内阁把目前日本经济的景气状态——通过对工人阶级和人民的彻底剥削、篡夺和强行产业合理化造成的资本积累状态，用来作为欺骗日本人民的手段。池田内阁在更加增加资本积累的同时，企图通过贸易和外汇的自由化来积极把美国资本导进日本，这是它们的重要路线。宫本指出，但是日本经济目前已经部分出现生产过剩现象。池田政府虽然想用贸易和外汇自由化、加强日美经济合作的手段来解决尖锐化的市场问题，但这种方法必然招致促进在国内加强剥削政策和对东南亚洲的帝国主义性侵入，同时必将加强通过集中和加强垄断资本、让美国资本控制日本基础产业的手段，来加强日美垄断资本对日本人民的双层剥削。宫本强调指出，日本人民今后的斗争的中心课题必须是把阻止修改“安全条约”斗争所指明的目标为争取独立、和平、中立的斗争同反对美帝国主义和日本垄断资本的剥削、维护日本人民的生活的斗争相结合。
    宫本在报告中提出了日本民主力量当前的共同纲领：不承认和废除新“安全条约”，粉碎日美军事同盟，恢复日中邦交，维护各阶层人民的生活，最后建立民主联合政府。
    他号召日本全体民主力量加强统一战线，为实现这些共同要求而斗争。
    在日共全国积极分子会议上，日共主席野坂参三致开会词。在会上讲话的还有组织部长松岛治重、文化部长藏原惟人、和平与基地对策部长神山茂夫和日共国会议员团长志贺义雄以及其他各部负责人。
    总书记宫本显治最后作了会议总结。
