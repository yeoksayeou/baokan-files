    Congratulating Cyprus on its Independence
    Cyprus, which has been ruled by British colonialists for more than eighty years, officially declared its independence today. This is another victory for the struggle of oppressed people against imperialism. The Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the Cypriot people's struggle for national independence, and we congratulate the founding of the Republic of Cyprus with excitement.
    The independence of Cyprus proves once again that the demand for independence by colonial people is an irreversible historical trend, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for imperialism to maintain its colonial rule. The independence of Cyprus did not come from the "gift" of British colonialists, but from the result of the Cypriot people's long-term and unyielding struggle. As everyone knows, as early as World War II, Britain had promised to grant the Cypriot people the right to self-determination. However, after the war, Britain broke its promise and tried its best to suppress the Cypriot people's desire for independence. On this small island with a population of only over 500,000, Britain sent 40,000 colonial troops to brutally suppress the Cypriot people's struggle for independence, killing thousands of Cypriot patriots. The British colonialists implemented "emergency measures" in Cyprus for as long as four years, turning this beautiful island into a hell of terror and disaster. However, violent suppression did not extinguish the flames of the Cypriot people's struggle; on the contrary, it made the flames of struggle even more intense. The Cypriot people not only continuously opposed the colonial authorities with strikes, market strikes, school strikes, and demonstrations, but also launched armed struggle in 1955. In the fierce struggle of October 1958, Cypriot patriots ambushed British colonial troops and their vehicles more than 200 times, killing and wounding more than 100 British colonial officers and soldiers. The Cypriot people even attacked British air force bases. The Cypriot people's persistent patriotic and anti-imperialist struggle put the British colonial authorities in an extremely embarrassing situation. Therefore, the British government played tricks of deception again, successively proposing so-called "constitutional reforms" and "new Cyprus plans," attempting to maintain its rule over Cyprus, while also trying its best to create ethnic disputes and conflicts between the Greek and Turkish residents of Cyprus in order to realize its conspiracy of "divide and rule." However, the Cypriot people neither succumbed to violent suppression nor were deceived by political deception. The Cypriot people's determination to demand national independence became stronger and stronger. Relying on their own resolute struggle, they shattered the colonialists' conspiracies time and time again, and finally forced the British authorities to recognize the independence of Cyprus.
    However, British colonialists have still not completely abandoned their attempt to control Cyprus. Although Britain has recognized the independence of Cyprus, according to the Zurich-London Agreement and the recent British-Cypriot agreement on military bases, Britain retains two military bases with "sovereignty" and thirty military strongholds and six training areas in Cyprus. British military aircraft will fly unrestrictedly over Cyprus. The agreement also stipulates that Cyprus conclude military alliance treaties with Greece and Turkey, and that Greece and Turkey station troops in Cyprus respectively. In addition, Britain is still playing "divide and rule" tricks in the provisions of government agencies, parliamentary organizations, courts, and local governments. These provisions of the agreement are a great damage to the national sovereignty of the Cypriot people. The Cypriot people are continuing their struggle for complete independence.
    The Cypriot people who have already achieved independence are also facing another more vicious and insidious enemy, which is the American imperialism that has been trying to replace the British colonialists. The United States has long interfered in the situation in Cyprus. Last year, when there were serious conflicts of interest between Britain, Turkey, and Greece on the Cyprus issue, which had become one of the major contradictions within the North Atlantic group, the United States seized the opportunity that Britain could not cope with and forced Greece and Turkey to reach the Zurich Agreement without Cypriot participation, and then put pressure on Britain to come up with a Zurich-London agreement, and imposed this product of imperialist collusion on the Cypriot people. The idea of the United States is to turn Cyprus into its strategic base in the Mediterranean. The United States hopes to link independent Cyprus with the Central Treaty Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in order to strengthen the weakened southern flank of the North Atlantic Group. The United States is colluding with Britain to plan to establish missile bases in Cyprus aimed at socialist countries. This conspiracy of American imperialism seriously threatens the security of the Cypriot people, and therefore cannot but be strongly opposed by the Cypriot people. Recently, the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus issued a statement pointing out that "The struggle to demilitarize Cyprus is part of the overall struggle for complete independence." The Cypriot people, who sacrificed their lives to get rid of British colonial rule, did not do so in order to turn their country into a war base for American imperialism. We believe that the Cypriot people, who have fought heroically for independence, will be able to achieve greater victories in the struggle to completely eliminate imperialist forces and safeguard national independence, just as they were able to force the British colonial authorities to recognize their independence.

### 祝贺塞浦路斯独立

    祝贺塞浦路斯独立
    被英国殖民主义者统治了八十多年的塞浦路斯，今天正式宣告独立了。这是被压迫的人民反对帝国主义的斗争的又一胜利。中国人民一向同情和支持塞浦路斯人民争取民族独立的斗争，我们以兴奋的心情祝贺塞浦路斯共和国的成立。
    塞浦路斯的独立再一次证明了，殖民地人民要求独立，是任何力量也无法阻挡的历史潮流，帝国主义要想维持它们的殖民统治，是越来越难以办到了。塞浦路斯的独立，并不是来自英国殖民主义者的“恩赐”，而是塞浦路斯人民经过长期不屈不挠斗争的结果。大家知道，早在第二次世界大战期间，英国就曾经许诺给予塞浦路斯人民以自决权利。但是战争结束之后，英国自食其言，而且对塞浦路斯人民要求独立的愿望竭力压制。在这个只有五十多万人口的小小岛屿上，英国派去了四万殖民军队，野蛮地镇压塞浦路斯人民争取独立的斗争，杀害了成千上万的塞浦路斯爱国人士。英国殖民者在塞浦路斯施行“紧急措施”达四年之久。使这个美丽的岛屿变成了恐怖和灾难的地狱。然而，暴力镇压并不能扑灭塞浦路斯人民的斗争火焰，相反的，使得斗争的火焰更加炽烈了。塞浦路斯人民不但不断以罢工、罢市、罢课和示威来反对殖民当局，而且在1955年开始发动了武装斗争。在斗争激烈的1958年10月，塞浦路斯的爱国者对英国殖民军及其车辆进行了二百多次伏击，打死打伤英殖民军官兵一百多人。塞浦路斯人民甚至袭击英国的空军基地。塞浦路斯人民坚持不懈的爱国反帝斗争，使得英国殖民当局陷于极为狼狈的境地。于是，英国政府又玩弄起欺骗的伎俩，先后提出所谓“宪法改革”、“塞浦路斯新计划”等，企图维持它对塞浦路斯的统治，同时竭力在塞浦路斯的希腊族居民和土耳其族居民之间制造民族纠纷和冲突，以实现其“分而治之”的阴谋。但是，塞浦路斯人民既不屈服于暴力镇压，也不受政治欺骗的蒙蔽。塞浦路斯人民坚决要求民族独立的斗争越来越强烈。他们依靠自己的坚决斗争，粉碎了殖民主义者一次又一次的阴谋，终于迫使英国当局不得不承认塞浦路斯的独立。
    但是，英国殖民主义者仍然没有完全放弃他们控制塞浦路斯的图谋。英国虽然承认了塞浦路斯独立，然而根据苏黎世—伦敦协议和最近的英国—塞浦路斯关于军事基地的协议，英国在塞浦路斯保有两个“拥有主权”的军事基地和三十个军事据点，六个训练地区。英国的军用飞机将在塞浦路斯上空不受限制地飞行。协定还规定塞浦路斯同希腊和土耳其缔结军事同盟条约，希、土分别在塞驻军。此外，英国还在政府机构、议会组织、法院、地方政府等方面的规定中玩弄“分治”的花招。协定的这些规定，是对塞浦路斯人民的民族主权的极大损害。塞浦路斯人民为了争取完全的独立，正继续进行斗争。
    已经取得了独立的塞浦路斯人民还面对着另一个更凶恶和阴险的敌人，这就是一直企图取英国殖民者的地位而代之的美帝国主义。美国早就插手干预塞浦路斯的局势。去年当英、土、希之间在塞浦路斯问题上存在严重利益冲突，已成为北大西洋集团内部的重大矛盾之一时，美国看准乘英国无法应付之机，迫使希腊和土耳其达成没有塞浦路斯人参加的苏黎世协议，然后又对英施加压力，搞出了一个苏黎世—伦敦协定，并把这个帝国主义勾结的产物，强加于塞浦路斯人民头上。美国所打的主意，就是想把塞浦路斯变成为它在地中海的战略基地。美国希望使独立后的塞浦路斯同中央条约组织和北大西洋公约组织联系起来，以加强被削弱了的北大西洋集团的南翼。美国正和英国勾结，计划在塞浦路斯建立针对社会主义国家的导弹基地。美帝国主义的这种阴谋，严重威胁到塞浦路斯人民的安全，因而自然不能不遭到塞浦路斯人民的强烈反对。最近塞浦路斯劳动人民进步党发表声明指出：“争取使塞浦路斯非军事化的斗争，是争取完全独立的总的斗争的一部分。”塞浦路斯人民不惜牺牲争取摆脱英国的殖民统治，并不是为了要把自己的国土变成为美帝国主义的战争基地的。我们相信，曾经为争取独立而英勇斗争的塞浦路斯人民，既然能够迫使英国殖民当局承认了他们的独立，也一定能够在彻底清除帝国主义势力、维护民族独立的斗争中，取得更大的胜利。
