        All Things Arise from "Sincerity"
        Jin Hanhui

    On July 18th, the People's Daily published a hand-written note on page eight by Comrade Zhao Jixian, First Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal First Commercial Bureau Committee, entitled "Why So Many Huqin Strings?". After reading this article, my mood remained unsettled for a long time. I thought: How can comrades on the commercial front have such drive and style, and achieve such results? What is the reason that motivates them? Besides the Mao Zedong era, where can one find such commercial workers in ancient and modern times, in Chinese and foreign history and philosophy?

    I think that the main reason that prompts them to achieve such great results is the word "sincerity." People often say: "All things arise from 'sincerity'." Their sincerity in supporting agriculture bursts forth with infinite wisdom, generates the determination to overcome difficulties, and enables them to accomplish great achievements. The comrades of the Wuhan Municipal Sports, Stationery and Instruments Store sincerely and earnestly implement the Party's instructions on strengthening the agricultural front. They have a sincere desire to support agricultural production. When they see that so many huqin strings are needed, and the inventory is so low, they think of going to the factory as apprentices, learning technology, and going to the countryside to train technicians; using the ingenious method of mobilizing the masses to produce to solve the contradiction. Precisely because they sincerely want to support agricultural production and strengthen the agricultural front, they brave the heavy rain to painstakingly learn the process of gluing huqin strings in the factory courtyard. In order to make things convenient for the farmers, they purchased raw silk and fish glue, carried the raw materials, and their bedding, and traveled to fifteen counties, training dozens of technicians in the production of huqin strings, solving the problem of strings for 180,000 rice transplanters in one fell swoop, and ensuring the timely transplanting of rice in the spring.

    Currently, on the agricultural production front, the war drums are beating loudly, people and horses are shouting, and industrial, commercial, educational, military, and government cadres are supporting the agricultural front in full swing. Some departments rush in headlong, bringing everyone and everything; some departments strive to meet the needs of the agricultural front in every possible way. Comrades from all walks of life and all departments should learn from their style and catch up with them.

    万事出于“诚”
    靳瀚恢
    7月18日人民日报八版刊登了中共武汉市第一商业局委员会第一书记赵吉先同志一篇手记《为什么要这么多胡琴弦》。我读了这篇文章以后，心情很久不能平静下来。我想：商业战线上的同志们竟能有这样的干劲和风格，竟能干出这样的成绩，是什么原因在促使着他们呢？除了毛泽东时代，在古今中外、经史子集中，哪里能见到这样的商业工作者呢？
    我想，促使他们能干出这样伟大的成绩，主要的原因就是一个“诚”字。人们常说：“万事出于‘诚’”，他们支援农业的心一诚，就迸发出了无穷的智慧，就产生了克服困难的决心，就能干出丰功伟绩。武汉市体育文具仪器商店的职工同志，他们诚心实意贯彻执行党关于加强农业战线的指示，他们具有着一片支援农业生产的诚心实意。他们一看到需要胡琴弦这么多，而库存量又这么少，于是就想出自己下工厂当学徒，学技术，到农村，培养技术员；用发动群众生产的这个绝妙的办法来解决矛盾。正因为他们真心诚意地要支援农业生产，加强农业战线，于是冒着大雨在工厂院子里苦心学习胡琴上胶这道工序。为了把方便留给农民，他们采购了生丝、鱼胶，带着原料，背着铺盖，跑遍十五个县，训练出了几十名生产胡琴弦的技术员，一举解决了十八万部插秧机的用弦问题，保证了春季插秧的及时进行。
    目前，农业生产战线上，战鼓咚咚，人喊马嘶，工商学兵机关干部支援农业战线如火如荼。有些部门，连人带马，一拥而上；有些部门，千方百计，为满足农业战线需要而斗争。各行各业各个部门的同志们，都应该学习他们那种风格，迎头赶上去。
