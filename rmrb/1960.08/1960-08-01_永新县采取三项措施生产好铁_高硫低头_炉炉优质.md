Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 31st - Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, has mobilized workers and masses in various iron smelting units to offer suggestions and strategies to overcome high sulfur content, promoting rapid improvement in pig iron quality and continuous increase in production. Currently, the average sulfur content of pig iron in the county has been reduced from 0.16% to 0.048%, and the pig iron qualification rate has reached over 95%, achieving good iron and more iron from every furnace.

    Since May of this year, Yongxin County has launched a high-yield campaign of iron smelting using indigenous coke, which has driven the daily output of pig iron to rapidly break through the 150-ton mark. Subsequently, in response to the high sulfur content of pig iron, which was over 0.1% and unfavorable for steelmaking and casting, various iron smelting units mobilized workers to do everything possible to reduce the sulfur content and improve the quality of pig iron. The three effective desulfurization measures they universally adopted are: First, reduce the sulfur content of raw materials and fuel, and implement desulfurization both inside and outside the furnace during the processing of raw materials and fuel; second, sprinkle lime powder in the sand mold iron channel to perform external desulfurization; and third, increase the hot blast temperature as much as possible to promote the rise of the hearth temperature.

    永新县采取三项措施生产好铁
    高硫低头　炉炉优质
    新华社南昌31日电　江西永新县各炼铁单位发动职工群众献计献策战胜高硫，促进生铁质量迅速提高、产量不断上升。现在，全县生铁平均含硫量已经由0.16％降低到0.048％，生铁合格率达到95％以上，做到了炉炉出好铁、多出铁。
    永新县从今年5月份起开展了用土焦炼铁的高产运动，推动生铁日产量迅速突破了一百五十吨大关。随后，各炼铁单位又针对生铁含硫量高达0.1％以上不利于炼钢和铸造的情况，发动职工千方百计降低了含硫量，提高了生铁质量。他们普遍采用的行之有效的降硫措施主要有三。一是减少原料燃料的含硫量，在处理原料和燃料的除硫过程中，实行炉内、炉外加工除硫；二是在沙模铁水沟里撒石灰粉，进行炉外脱硫，三是尽量提高热风温度，促进炉缸温度上升。
