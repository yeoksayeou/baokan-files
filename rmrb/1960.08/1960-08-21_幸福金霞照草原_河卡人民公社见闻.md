New Look of the Settlement

The car sped along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, which runs through the Tala Grassland. After crossing a mountain ridge, we arrived at the settlement of the Heka People's Commune in Xinghai County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Looking up, the overlapping Heka Mountain and Yelong Mountain faced us. The green-tinged yellow wheat, highland barley, and golden dazzling rapeseed flowers rolled wave after wave into the distance. In the afterglow of the evening, green mountains, blue skies, wheat fields, rapeseed flowers, and sheep flocks intertwined to form a colorful and dazzling picture.

Walking into the settlement, we saw rows of newly built houses on both sides of the straight streets. From the signs hanging on the door frames and courtyard walls, we recognized the commune members' public canteens, nurseries, and housing. The red-tiled houses were shops, hospitals, post offices, and primary schools. The houses at the end, painted snow-white, were the commune's comprehensive factory, barbershop, and bathhouse. An elderly Tibetan man said with a proud and self-assured tone, smilingly: "Unimaginable, right? Just over a year ago, this was still a desolate beach scattered with animal bones and weeds!"

However, what is even more admirable is that at an altitude of 3,200 meters, the crops are growing so well.

Desolate Beach Turns into Granary

One morning, we stepped on the wet grass and visited Secretary Yingba of the Bailong Production Team. He was originally the Party Branch Secretary of the Heka Brigade, but this year, in response to the Party's call, he came to this team as the Party Branch Secretary.

Secretary Yingba was holding a brush, painting the canteen walls snow-white and dazzling, and pasting portraits of Chairman Mao and pictures on the walls. Two middle-aged women in colorful clothes were skillfully making noodle soup next to the shiny new stoves. Secretary Yingba pointed to a pile of cut cabbage and said with a proud tone: "This is what we grew ourselves!" Afterwards, when talking about this year's good harvest, he couldn't help but say with emotion: "It wasn't easy! For generations, our Tibetan people have relied solely on herding sheep to make a living. Not to mention farming, we haven't even seen what crops look like!"

"In 1958, the Heka Grassland established the People's Commune. According to the Party's policy of 'mainly animal husbandry, combined with agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations,' we opened up wasteland on a large scale and planted crops on a large scale. It's really fast. Last year, our team, like the whole commune, had more than 200 jin of grain per person and reserved more than 100 jin of fodder for each livestock. What about this year? Each person has an average of more than seven mu of crops. Now, people have surplus grain and livestock have surplus grass. We will also take out grain to support national construction!" Secretary Yingba said meaningfully: "Follow the Party and listen to Chairman Mao, and a desolate beach can also become a granary!"

Shepherd Boy Becomes Agricultural Production Expert

In the fields, you can find many new people and new things everywhere. You see, ordinary herdsmen who only knew how to herd sheep in the past are now creating many miracles in agriculture with beautiful ideals! Communist Party member Junni, who grew from an ordinary herdsman to an agricultural production expert, is just one of many examples. After the establishment of the People's Commune, he often went to the nearby grassland work station to learn techniques, circling around the horse-drawn mower and harvester. In 1957, they joined the four communities of the Lighthouse and planted 105 mu of crops, harvesting more than 1,000 jin of grain.

After settling down, Junni had more opportunities to learn techniques at the nearby state-owned ranch. He was very serious about studying agricultural technology. In April last year, the commune sent him to a training class for agricultural and animal husbandry machinery in Xining City for three months. On Sundays, some students went to the streets to stroll around, and some went to see movies, but he squatted next to the seeder, harvester, and disc harrow all day, pondering and asking questions, wishing he could put everything into his mind at once. After he went back, he became an agricultural production "expert" on the grassland. That year, they planted more than 400 mu of crops and achieved grain self-sufficiency in one fell swoop. Later, he served as the agricultural team leader of the Lighthouse Production Team. Under the Party's call of "marching towards the wasteland and asking for grain from the land," he led the commune members to overfulfill the task of reclaiming wasteland. In February of this year, he gloriously attended the Qinghai Province Agricultural and Animal Husbandry "Heroes' Meeting."

Cattle and Sheep are Fat and Days are Prosperous

At the settlement, we visited many public canteens, nurseries, homes for the elderly, and shops. We saw that every household had neatly arranged wooden boxes, folded with new quilts and blankets, and some had thermos bottles on the kang. In the store, a salesperson said with a smile: "Business is extremely good this year. Sales in the first half of the year were more than 370,000 yuan, more than twice as much as the whole year last year!" A savings officer at the bank also scrambled to say: "Our 'business' is not bad either. Private deposits have increased three times compared to the first six months of last year!"

We also visited yurts at the pastoral areas and found that the sheep were all fat and round. An old shepherd of the Lighthouse Production Team patted a fluffy wether and praised: "I have never seen such fat sheep. A few days ago, we slaughtered a fattened sheep, and it weighed more than 90 jin on the scale!" Recalling the concerns of the commune members at the beginning of the expansion of cultivated land, he told us that when everyone saw that the commune had planted more than 15,000 mu of land this year, twice as much as last year, they were still muttering about what the cattle and sheep would eat if more land was planted! But the Party really has a way. The secretaries, the commune leaders, and the team cadres helped the herdsmen to divide the grasslands, changing pastures every half month and arranging them every day so that the sheep could eat their fill. These days, everyone is extremely happy to see that the cattle and sheep are fat and strong.

On the Heka Grassland, we once heard elderly people sing about the tragic life of the old society: "Looking for a meal after eating one meal, seeing yellow faces in the soup, clothes patched with three jins of thread, blood and tears flowing endlessly!" Now, in the homes for the elderly, we see old men and women leisurely drinking milk tea. When Tibetan elders talked about these changes, pointing to the new houses in front of them and the endless golden crops, they said meaningfully: "Our ancestors have been looking forward to a good life for generations, but the sun never shines on us. Now, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have sent the happy golden glow to the grassland, warming the hearts of all Tibetans!" (with picture)

    幸福金霞照草原
    ——河卡人民公社见闻
    周廉朴　邢克忠
    定居点新貌
    汽车奔驰在横贯塔拉草原的青康公路上。翻过一道山岗，我们来到了海南藏族自治州兴海县河卡人民公社的定居点。抬头望去，迎面踡卧的河卡山、野龙山丛峦叠障，翠里泛黄的小麦、青稞、金黄耀眼的菜花，波浪翻腾地滚向远方。在晚霞辉映中，青山、碧空、麦海、菜花、羊群，交织成一幅五彩缤纷、闪光夺目的图画。
    走进定居点，只见笔直的街道两旁，新盖的房屋一幢幢、一排排。从门框、院墙上悬挂着的牌子，我们辨认出那是社员的公共食堂、托儿所、住房。那红色的瓦房，是商店、医院、邮电所和小学校。尽头粉刷得雪白的房屋，是公社的综合工厂、理发馆、浴室。一位藏族老人带着骄傲而自豪的口吻，笑迷迷地对我们说：“想不到吧？一年多以前，这里还是兽骨、野草等七零八散的荒滩哩！”
    然而，更加令人赞叹的是，这里海拔三千二百米，庄稼居然长得这样好。
    荒滩变成米粮川
    一天早晨，我们踏着湿漉漉的草地，到白龙生产队访问了英巴书记。他原来是河卡大队的党总支书记，今年响应党的号召，到这个队担任党支部书记。
    英巴书记提着刷子，把食堂的墙壁刷得雪白耀眼，正往墙上贴着毛主席像和一幅幅画。两个穿着花衣的中年妇女，在油光崭亮的锅灶旁，熟练地做着汤面条。英巴书记指着一堆切好的白菜，充满自豪的口吻说：“这是我们自己种的！过后，谈到今年的好收成时，他不禁感慨地说：“不容易啊！我们藏族祖祖辈辈、世世代代单靠挡羊过活，别说务农活，连庄稼啥样都没有见过哟！”
    “1958年，河卡草原成立了人民公社。根据党提出的“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针，大开荒地，大种庄稼。真快哟，去年，我们队同全社一样，每人有粮二百多斤，给每头牲畜储备了一百多斤饲草。今年呢？每个人平均有七亩多庄稼，这下子是人有余粮，畜有余草。我们还要拿出粮食支援国家建设哩！”英巴书记意味深长地说：“跟党走，听毛主席的话，荒滩也能变成米粮川！”
    放羊娃成了农业生产能手
    在庄稼地里，到处可以碰到许多新人新事。你看，从前还是只会挡羊的普通牧民，如今他们怀着美好的理想，在农业上创造出多少奇迹！共产党员君尼，从一个普通牧民成长为农业生产能手，就是许多事例中的一件。人民公社成立以后，他常到附近的草原工作站去学习技术，围着马拉割草机、收割机转。1957年，他们联合灯塔四社，种了一百零五亩庄稼，打下了一千多斤粮食。
    定居以后，君尼就有更多的机会到附近的国营牧场学习技术了。他对钻研农业技术非常认真。去年4月，公社派他到西宁市农牧机械训练班学习了三个月。逢到星期天，学员们有的到街上逛逛，有的去看电影，可是他整天蹲在播种机、收割机、圆盘耙旁琢磨，见人就问这问那，恨不得一下子把什么都装进脑子里。他回去以后，成了草原上农业生产的“专家”。这年，他们种了四百多亩庄稼，一举实现了粮食自给。以后他担任了灯塔生产队的农业小队长，在党的“向荒滩进军，向大地要粮”的号召下，他又带领社员超额完成了开荒任务。今年2月，他光荣地出席了青海省农牧业“群英会”。
    牛羊肥壮日子兴旺
    在定居点上，我们访问过不少公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院、商店。我们看到家家户户屋里都整齐地摆着木箱，叠着新被褥、毛毯，有的炕上摆着热水瓶。在商店里，一位售货员微笑地对我们说：“今年营业好极啦，上半年售货三十七万多元，比去年全年还多两倍哩！”银行的一位储蓄员也抢着说：“我们的‘生意’也不坏，私人存款数比去年头六个月增加三倍！”
    我们还到牧业点上走访帐房，碰见的羊只一个个都肥壮得圆鼓鼓的。灯塔生产队有个老放牧员用手拍着一只毛绒绒的羯羊，连声称赞说：“没见过这等肥硕的羊。前些日子，宰了只育肥羊，一过秤足足九十多斤呀！”他回想起扩大耕地初期社员的顾虑时，告诉我们，大伙见公社今年一下子种了一万五千多亩地，比去年扩大了两倍，心里还嘀咕着，地种多了，牛羊吃啥呀！可是党真有办法，书记呀、社长呀、队上的干部呀，帮助牧民划分草原，半月一换草场，一天一安排，羊吃得饱饱的。这阵子，大伙看着牛羊又肥又壮，高兴极了。
    在河卡草原上，我们曾听到过老年人控诉旧社会悲惨生活的歌咏：“吃一餐来找一餐，喝汤照见黄皮脸，衣服补了三斤线，血泪成河流不断！”而今，在敬老院里，我们看见老大爷、老阿奶悠闲地喝着奶茶。藏族老人谈起这些变化来，指着眼前的新房和那望不到边的金黄色的庄稼，意味深长地说：“我们祖祖辈辈盼望着好日子，可是太阳老照不到我们。现在呢，共产党和毛主席把幸福的金霞送到草原来，照得藏民人人心里暖融融的！”（附图片）
