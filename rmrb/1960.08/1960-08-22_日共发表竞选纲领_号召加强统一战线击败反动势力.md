Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 21st: The Japanese Communist Party today announced the election platform passed by the Central Committee plenary session on the 17th and 18th. The platform called on the Japanese people to strengthen the united front and fight for the establishment of a democratic united government.

　　The platform was announced by Central Committee Executive Committee member, Kikunami Katsumi, at a press conference held at the party headquarters in Tokyo.

　　When explaining the content of the election platform to reporters, Kikunami said that the party will focus on exposing the main enemies of the Japanese people—US imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries—in the election campaign.

　　Kikunami continued, "The Communist Party believes that the particularly significant meaning of the upcoming election lies in the fact that this election will be the political expression of the unprecedented movement of the vast majority of the Japanese people against the 'Security Treaty' in one form or another."

　　Kikunami elaborated in detail on the important significance of strengthening the united front and establishing a democratic united government against the new "Security Treaty" as proposed in the election platform. The election platform calls on the people to strengthen and expand the united front, including the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, as well as all other democratic forces. The platform demands that the people rely on the weapon of the united front in the upcoming election to defeat the reactionary forces and strive to establish a democratic united government against the new "Security Treaty."

　　The election platform states that the Communist Party is prepared to cooperate with all those who oppose the new "Security Treaty" to achieve the above goals.

　　The election platform states that the Communist Party believes that all those who oppose the "Security Treaty" can reach a consensus on the following: demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons, concluding a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, restoring diplomatic relations with China, safeguarding the constitution and democracy, and improving and stabilizing people's lives.

　　The Central Committee Secretariat's communiqué, also announced by Kikunami Katsumi at the press conference, said that the Central Committee plenary session has decided to launch a vigorous pre-election propaganda campaign.

    日共发表竞选纲领
    号召加强统一战线击败反动势力
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本共产党今天发表了中央委员会全体会议在17日和18日通过的竞选纲领。纲领号召日本人民加强统一战线，为建立民主联合政府而斗争。
    这个纲领是由中央干部会委员听涛克己在东京党的总部举行的记者招待会上宣布的。
    听涛在解释竞选纲领的内容时对记者们说，党在竞选中将把重点放在揭露日本人民的主要敌人——美帝国主义和日本反动派上面。
    听涛接着说：“共产党认为，未来选举的特别重大的意义在于，这次选举将是绝大多数日本人民以这种或那种形式反对‘安全条约’的空前运动在政治上的表现。”
    听涛详细阐述了竞选纲领提出的关于加强统一战线和建立反对新“安全条约”的民主联合政府的重要意义。竞选纲领呼吁人民加强和扩大包括社会党和共产党以及所有其他民主力量在内的统一战线。纲领要求人民在即将到来的选举中，依靠统一战线这一武器来击败反动势力，争取建立反对新“安全条约”的民主联合政府。
    竞选纲领表示共产党准备同反对新“安全条约”的所有的人合作来达到上述目的。
    竞选纲领说，共产党相信，所有反对“安全条约”的人能够取得一致意见：要求禁止核武器，同苏联缔结和约，同中国恢复外交关系，维护宪法和民主，提高和稳定人民生活。
    听涛克己在记者招待会上同时宣布的中央委员会书记局的公报说，中央委员会全体会议已经决定展开有力的选举前的宣传运动。
