Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 7th – Cuban Prime Minister Castro solemnly announced at a mass rally of 50,000 people here this morning that the American-owned Cuban Electric Company, the Cuban Telephone Company, and all American-owned sugar and oil companies in the country would be nationalized.

The Cuban people from all walks of life, youth representatives from Latin American countries, and trade union leaders attending the rally all stood up and cheered enthusiastically after Prime Minister Castro announced the decision, congratulating the Cuban government on its decision.

The mass rally was held to celebrate the First Latin American Youth Congress. At the meeting, slogans such as "Down with American Imperialism," "With Latin American Unity, We Will Win," and "Latin America Yes, Yankees No" rose one after another, and the masses sang and danced excitedly.

Prime Minister Castro read out a law stipulating that all property of twenty-six American companies in Cuban territory would be nationalized, and announced the names of the companies being nationalized, including: Cuban Electric Company, Cuban Telephone Company, Esso Mobil Oil Company, West Indies Texaco Oil Company, Sinclair Cuban Oil Company, and thirty-six sugar mills in Cuba belonging to American monopoly companies including United Fruit Company and Gulf Atlantic Sugar Company.

The law emphasized that Cuba nationalized American companies in order to strengthen national independence and prevent losses caused by imperialist aggression. The law pointed out that the American-owned Cuban Electric Company and the Cuban Telephone Company were typical monopoly organizations engaged in sabotage activities; American sugar companies occupied Cuba's best land and had already earned back their investments; American oil companies defrauded the Cuban national economy, monopolized prices, and plotted sinister sabotage conspiracies.

The law emphasized that the duties of the Latin American people prompted Cuba to recover its national wealth and free it from the control of foreign monopoly groups. The Cuban revolution will not stop until it achieves complete national liberation.

According to the law, Cuba will compensate these nationalized American companies by paying bonds with a term of fifty years and an annual interest rate of 2%. The funds for these bonds should be raised under the following circumstances: in addition to purchasing three million tons of sugar annually, the United States shall purchase sugar exceeding this amount from Cuba at a price of not less than 5.40 pesos per hundred kilograms. Then, Cuba will extract one-quarter of the income it receives from the United States' purchase of this excess sugar to establish this fund.

In his speech, Prime Minister Castro condemned American imperialism for imposing the system it needed on the people of Latin American countries. He said that revolutionary power is the power to break shackles, eliminate irrational phenomena, and exploitation.

Prime Minister Castro finally pointed out that the people of the Americas bear the same burden on their shoulders, the same shackles around their necks, the same chains on their feet, and the same pain in their hearts caused by the American colonial system. He announced that each American sugar mill nationalized by Cuba would be named after a Latin American country.

    加强国家独立　维护民族财富　反击帝国主义侵略
    古巴将一批美国公司收归国有
    卡斯特罗谴责美国殖民制度给拉丁美洲人民套上枷锁
    新华社哈瓦那7日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗在今天清晨在这里结束的有五万人参加的群众大会上庄严地宣布，把这个国家中的美资古巴电力公司、古巴电话公司以及所有美国资本的糖厂和石油公司收归国有。
    参加这次大会的古巴各界人民、拉丁美洲各国的青年代表和工会领导人在卡斯特罗总理宣布这一决定后，全体起立，并且热烈欢呼，祝贺古巴政府的这一决定。
    这次群众大会是为庆祝拉丁美洲第一次青年代表大会而召开的。会上，“打倒美帝国主义”、“有了拉丁美洲的团结，我们必胜”、“要拉丁美洲不要美国佬”的口号声此起彼伏，到会群众兴奋地载歌载舞。
    卡斯特罗总理在会上宣读了规定把在古巴领土上的二十六家美国公司的全部财产收归国有的法律，并且宣布了这些被收归国有的公司的名字，其中包括：古巴电力公司、古巴电话公司、埃索美孚油公司、西印度群岛德士古石油公司、辛克莱古巴石油公司，以及包括联合果品公司和海湾大西洋糖公司在内的美国垄断公司在古巴的三十六家糖厂。
    这项法律强调指出，古巴把美国公司收归国有，是为了加强国家的独立和防止由于帝国主义侵略而造成损失。这项法律指出，美资古巴电力公司和古巴电话公司就是典型的进行破坏活动的垄断组织；美国糖业公司霸占了古巴的最好的土地，而且已经赚回了它们的投资；美国石油公司对古巴的国家经济进行诈骗，垄断价格，并且策划罪恶的破坏阴谋。
    这项法律强调说，拉丁美洲人民的职责促使古巴收回它的民族财富，使民族财富摆脱外国垄断集团的控制。古巴革命不到实现国家的完全解放决不停止。
    根据这项法律规定，古巴将通过付予期限为五十年、年利为2％的债券，来补偿这些被收归国有的美国公司。这种债券的基金应在下述情况下筹集：美国除了每年购买三百万吨食糖以外，并且以每公担不少于五比索四十分的价格向古巴购买超过这个数额的食糖，然后，古巴将从它由于美国购买这批超额食糖而得到的收入中抽取四分之一，来建立这项基金。
    卡斯特罗总理在讲话中谴责美帝国主义把它所需要的那种制度强加于拉丁美洲各国人民。他说，革命的权力，就是粉碎枷锁，消灭不合理现象和剥削的权力。
    卡斯特罗总理最后指出，美洲各国人民的肩上压着相同的重担、脖子上套着相同的枷锁、脚上捆着相同的铁链，并且在内心中怀着由于美国殖民制度所带来的相同的痛苦。他宣布，被古巴收归国有的每一家美国糖厂将以一个拉丁美洲国家的名字命名。
