    Playing a Connecting Role in Organizing Train-Ship Coordination

    Dalian Port is a transit port for sea-land combined transportation. Since October of last year, we have worked with railway and shipping departments to organize a coordinated one-stop transportation system, which has greatly shortened the time trains and ships spend in port and improved the port's throughput capacity. However, in the early stages of organizing this large-scale one-stop transportation collaboration, we felt that trains, ships, and goods were not under the port's dispatch, and the collaboration was not proactive enough. Since the beginning of this year, we have taken the initiative to work closely with the railway and shipping departments, finding ways to create convenient conditions for trains and ships to arrive at the port, and have thus achieved even greater results. Our specific measures are: First, strengthen planning and scheduling, actively participate in the railway and shipping departments' planning meetings, and jointly prepare a "one-stop" transportation plan. During the implementation of the plan, communicate with trains, ships, railways, and mines in a timely manner about manpower, equipment, and cargo situations, grasp the transportation progress, and adjust the port's operation plan. Second, reform the organizational system, with the railway and port establishing a unified planning and dispatching agency, and establishing a joint freight office to unify planning, unified dispatching guidance, and unified arrangement and use of forces and equipment. Third, in terms of operations, according to the operation organization of "dragon trains" and "dragon ships" and the types of goods, fix the storage yards, fix the loading and unloading forces, and implement "dragon train" and "dragon ship" loading and unloading specialization to improve loading and unloading efficiency and ensure the smooth flow of "dragon trains" and "dragon ships." Fourth, leverage the port's connecting role to organize direct transfer between trains and ships, accelerating the turnover of trains and ships.

    发挥纽带作用组织车船衔接
    大连港是海陆联运的中转港。从去年10月份开始，我们和铁路、航运部门组织一条龙协作运输，大大缩短了车船在港时间，提高了港口的通过能力。但是，在组织一条龙运输大协作的初期，我们觉得车船、货物都不属于港口调度，协作不够主动。今年以来，我们主动地和铁路、航运部门紧密配合，多方面设法为车船到港创造方便条件，因而收到了更大的效果。我们的具体措施是：第一，加强计划调度工作，主动参加铁路和航运部门的计划会议，共同编制“一条龙”运输计划。在执行计划过程中，及时和车船、路矿交流人力，设备和货物情况，掌握运输进度，调整港口的作业计划。第二，改革组织体制，路港双方建立统一的计划、调度机构，成立联合货运室，统一计划，统一调度指导，统一安排和使用力量和设备。第三，在作业上，按照“龙车”、“龙船”的运行组织和货物的品种，固定库场，固定装卸力量，实行“龙车”、“龙船”装卸专业化，提高装卸效率，保证“龙车”、“龙船”畅通。第四，发挥港口的纽带作用，组织车船直接换装，加速车船周转。
