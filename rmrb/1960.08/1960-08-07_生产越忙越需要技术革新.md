    The Busier the Production, the More Necessary Technological Innovation
    How to correctly resolve the relationship between production and technological innovation is an important issue frequently facing leading cadres in industrial and mining enterprises. Whether this issue is handled properly is directly related to the great improvement, great promotion, and leap-forward development of the current technological innovation and technological revolution movement and production. Technological innovation and production are a unified whole; technological innovation is the means, and promoting production is the goal. The two promote each other and are interconnected. The great development of production requires continuous technological innovation, and continuous technological innovation further promotes the sustained leap forward in production. There is an inseparable dialectical relationship between the two. The in-depth development of the nationwide technological innovation and technological revolution movement has found the broadest path for the high-speed, comprehensive, continuous, and great leap forward in China's socialist construction. Production cannot achieve a qualitative leap without technological innovation, and technological innovation without production is aimless and loses its vitality. Many facts prove that the busier the production, the heavier the task, the more technological innovation is needed. Where production is busy and tasks are heavy, technological innovation can best exert its powerful force.
    Some leading cadres in industrial and mining enterprises one-sidedly believe that engaging in technological innovation will affect production. Therefore, when production is busy and tasks are heavy, they often put technological innovation aside. This is obviously wrong. The opposite is true. Artificially separating production and technological innovation will inevitably restrict the forward development of productive forces and hinder the great leap forward in production. We say that everything advances in contradiction; without contradiction, things cannot exist. It must be admitted that there are still certain contradictions between technological innovation and production. When old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions appear again. This is the objective law of the development of things, and it is not surprising. But how to treat this contradiction and resolve this contradiction depends on whether one dares to revolutionize. The attitude that Marxists should hold is: to acknowledge contradictions and actively and proactively resolve contradictions. As long as the leadership is good, the organization is good, and the combination is good, the contradiction between technological innovation and production can be well resolved and eliminated, enabling production and technological innovation to leap forward together.

### 生产越忙越需要技术革新

    生产越忙越需要技术革新
    怎样正确的解决生产同技术革新的关系问题，是经常摆在工矿企业领导干部面前的重要问题之一。这个问题处理的得当与否，直接关系到当前技术革新、技术革命运动的大提高、大推广和生产的飞跃发展。技术革新同生产是统一的整体，技术革新是手段，促进生产是目的，二者互相促进，互相联系。生产的大发展需要不断革新技术，而技术的革新再革新又不断促进生产的持续跃进，二者之间有着不可分离的辩证关系。全民性的技术革新、技术革命运动的深入发展，为我国社会主义建设高速度全面持续大跃进，找到了最为广阔的道路，生产离开了技术革新就不能够实现质的飞跃，而技术革新离开了生产，就无的放矢，便失去了它的生命力。许多事实证明，生产越忙，任务越重，越需要技术革新，生产忙、任务重的地方，技术革新最能发挥它的强大威力。
    有的工矿企业领导干部，片面认为搞技术革新要影响生产，因此，在生产一忙、任务一重的时候，往往就把技术革新放在一边，这显然是不对的。事实正相反，把生产和技术革新人为的分割开来，势必束缚生产力的向前发展，妨碍生产的大跃进。我们说任何事物都是在矛盾中前进的，没有矛盾，事物就不可能存在。必须承认，技术革新同生产也还存在着一定的矛盾。旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又出现了，这是事物发展的客观规律，毫不奇怪。但是如何去对待这个矛盾和解决这个矛盾，关键在于敢不敢革命。马克思主义者应抱的态度是：承认矛盾，主动积极地去解决矛盾。只要领导得好，组织得好，结合得好，就能很好的解决和消除技术革新同生产的矛盾，使生产和技术革新双双跃进。
