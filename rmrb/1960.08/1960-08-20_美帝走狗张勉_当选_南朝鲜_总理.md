    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th – Seoul report: Under the direction of American imperialism, former South Korean "Vice President" Chang Myon was "elected" today as "Prime Minister" of the South Korean puppet government. The puppet "caretaker cabinet" of Huh Chung immediately announced its resignation.
    Due to the fierce competition between the "New Faction" and the "Old Faction" of the Democratic Party for this "Prime Minister" position, Chang Myon, the head of the "New Faction," was "elected" today in the "National Assembly" vote with only a slight majority of 117 votes to 107. Prior to this, the head of the Democratic Party's "Old Faction," "President" Yun Po-sun, had nominated Kim Do-yeon, a figure from the "Old Faction," as "Prime Minister," but it was not passed by the "National Assembly" due to opposition from the "New Faction."
    Chang Myon is a loyal agent of American imperialism who has been cultivated by the Democratic Party in South Korea for a long time. He studied at Manhattan College in the United States and served as South Korea's first "ambassador" to the United States. When Syngman Rhee was "President," he served as "Vice President" and, like Syngman Rhee, committed all kinds of treacherous and harmful acts against the people. He followed the will of the United States and not long ago openly advocated the establishment of an "Asian Anti-Communist Alliance" including Japan.

### 美帝走狗张勉  “当选”南朝鲜“总理”

    美帝走狗张勉
    “当选”南朝鲜“总理”
    新华社平壤19日电　汉城消息：在美帝国主义的导演下，南朝鲜前“副总统”张勉今天“当选”为南朝鲜傀儡政府的“总理”。许政的傀儡“看守内阁”随即宣布辞职。
    由于民主党“新派”和“旧派”激烈争夺这个“总理”的位置，“新派”首脑张勉今天在“民议院”表决时仅以一百一十七票对一百零七票的微弱多数“当选”。在这以前，民主党“旧派”首脑、“总统”尹谱善曾经提名“旧派”人物金度演为“总理”，但在“新派”反对下未获“民议院”通过。
    张勉是美帝国主义在南朝鲜民主党中长期培养的一个忠实代理人，他在美国的曼哈顿学院念过书，曾任南朝鲜驻美国的首任“大使”。在李承晚当“总统”时，他曾经当过“副总统”，和李承晚同样地做尽各种卖国殃民的坏事。他秉承美国的意旨，不久以前还公开鼓吹成立包括日本在内的“亚洲反共联盟”。
