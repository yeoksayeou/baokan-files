    Doctors as Teachers, Wards as Classrooms, Learning While Teaching, Applying What is Learned
    Wuhan Second Hospital Accelerates Nurse Training
    (Our report) Wuhan Second Hospital's amateur medical college, while providing theoretical lectures in the classroom, has also established "teaching wards" in the internal medicine department comprised of doctors and nurses. This closely integrates systematic theoretical learning in the classroom with clinical practice, combining treatment and teaching, and nursing and learning. This achieves learning while teaching and applying what is learned, greatly accelerating the speed at which nurses grasp medical and nursing knowledge and skills. At the same time, with the establishment of teaching wards, a new relationship of close collaboration has been established between doctors and nurses, and the quality of medical care and nursing has been significantly improved.
    With the vigorous development of national construction, Wuhan Second Hospital has transferred a large number of doctors to support industrial and mining areas and rural production construction in recent years. The doctors remaining in the hospital also frequently go to the countryside and factories to participate in the pest elimination and disease prevention campaign. In this way, on the one hand, the hospital's medical staff felt unable to meet the needs of daily business. On the other hand, many nursing staff, although participating in the amateur medical college, felt that classroom learning could not be well integrated with their current work. Under these circumstances, the hospital's Party organization, based on carrying out medical-nursing collaboration and multi-skilled personnel throughout the hospital last year, first led a physician and six nurses in the internal medicine ward to establish a "teaching ward" in February of this year, beginning experimental work to accelerate the training of nursing staff.
    Under the guidance of the idea of ​​cultivating talents at the fastest speed and adapting to current work needs, the teaching ward demonstrated its vitality as soon as it was established. First, in terms of teaching content, the policy of closely linking theory with practice and serving practice was resolutely implemented. It was determined that the clinical case diagnosis and treatment lectures would be closely integrated with theoretical learning in the classroom, achieving "two-pronged approach." The physician explained to the nurses the clinical diagnosis and treatment knowledge in combination with the treatment work and the theory in the classroom, based on the case situation in the ward during a certain period. This changed the problem that the nurses' book learning could not be well combined with daily work. Second, in terms of teaching methods, the method of master leading apprentice was adopted, learning while teaching and applying what is learned. The physician not only treats patients, but also teaches nurses clinical diagnosis and treatment knowledge and skills; while doing a good job of nursing, nurses comprehensively learn medical and nursing knowledge and skills under the guidance of the physician to improve their ability to serve patients. Third, in terms of organization, the "teaching ward" established a new relationship of division of labor and collaboration between medical and nursing staff. Each nurse is assigned to manage six to ten beds. From the patient's admission examination, treatment, nursing to discharge, a specialist responsibility system under the guidance of the physician is implemented, which facilitates them to actively understand patients, concentrate on caring for patients, and learn medical technology knowledge. Doctors also often assist nurses in doing some work. The entire ward has close cooperation between doctors and nurses, forming a united and concerted effort, which is both a working group and a learning group, jointly assuming all responsibilities for treating and caring for patients.
    The "teaching ward" has only been established for half a year, but it has achieved remarkable results. At present, it has been widely blooming in the hospital's internal medicine and surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and other wards. The nurses who participated in the study have systematically studied the systematic knowledge of four units, including medical history inquiry, physical examination, three-seven routine clinical significance, and physical examination of the heart, lungs, and abdomen, in the work and study activities of the "teaching ward" in a short period of half a year. They have rapidly improved from being able to do general nursing work to being able to inquire about medical history, write complete medical records, do laboratory tests, and diagnose and treat common diseases.

    医师是教员  病房当课堂  边教边学  边学边用
    武汉第二医院加速培养护士
    本报讯　武汉市第二医院主办的业余医学院在课堂讲授理论课的同时，又在内科病房里建立了由医师和护士们组成的“教学病房”，使得课堂的系统理论学习和临床实习密切相结合，治疗和教学相结合，护理和学习相结合，作到了边教边学，边学边用，大大加快了护士们掌握医疗护理的知识和技术的速度。同时，随着教学病房的建立，医生和护士之间建立了密切协作的新关系，医疗和护理质量得到显著的提高。
    随着国家建设事业的蓬勃发展，武汉市第二医院在近几年中陆续调出大批医生支援工矿地区和农村的生产建设，留在医院里的医生也经常下乡下厂参加除害灭病运动。这样，一方面，医院的医疗人员感到不能适应日常的业务需要，另一方面，许多护理人员虽然参加了业余医学院的学习，但感到课堂的学习不能很好地和自己当前的工作结合起来。在这种情况下，医院党组织在去年全院开展医护协作和多面手的基础上，首先领导内科病房的一位医师和六个护士在今年2月成立了“教学病房”，开始加速培养护理人员的试验工作。
    在用最快的速度培养人才，适应当前工作需要的思想指导下，教学病房一成立就显示出它的生命力。首先，在教学内容上，坚决贯彻了理论密切联系实际和为实际服务的方针，确定了临床病例的诊断治疗讲授和课堂的理论学习紧密结合，做到“双管齐下”。医师针对某个时期病房中的病例情况，结合治疗工作和课堂上的理论向护士们进行讲解。这样就改变了护士们的书本学习和日常工作不能很好结合的问题。其次，在教学方法上，采取了师傅带徒弟的办法，边教边学，边学边用。医师不光是给病人治病，而且还向护士们讲授临床诊断治疗的知识和技术；护士在做好护理工作的同时，在医师的指导下，全面地学习医疗护理的知识和技术，提高为病人服务的本领。第三，在组织上，“教学病房”建立了医疗和护理人员之间既分工又协作的新关系，每个护士分工管理六到十张病床，从病人的入院检查、治疗、护理到出院都实行医师指导下的专人负责制，便于她们主动地了解病人，专心致志地护理病人和学习医疗技术知识。医师也经常协助护士做些工作。整个病房医护之间密切配合，形成一条心一股劲，既是工作组，又是学习组，共同担负起治疗和护理病人的全部责任。
    “教学病房”从成立到现在只有半年的时间，但已取得了显著的成绩。目前它已经在这个医院的内科和外科、产妇科等病房普遍开花。参加学习的护士们在短短半年的“教学病房”的工作和学习活动中，都比较系统地学习了病史询问、体格检查、三七常规临床意义和心肺腹部的物理检查等四个单元的系统知识，由原来只能做一般护理工作迅速提高到能够查询病史、写完整病历、做化验检查以及对常见疾病进行诊断和治疗的水平。
