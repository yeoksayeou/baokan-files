    Innovation Knows No Bounds, Potential is Limitless
    We operate a locally-made and foreign-designed tippler, which can dump sixty tons of coal from train cars into electric coal loaders in just two minutes, and then load it into the ship's hold. We used to think that such an efficient piece of equipment could not be innovated upon; however, the Party educated us to break superstitions and liberate our minds, so we put our minds to work on this foreign machine. As a result, we discovered that it still had shortcomings: originally, it could only tip over thirty to sixty-ton train cars. Other specifications of train cars could not be tipped, and we had to manually unload the coal from the train cars to the coal storage yard, and then use machines to dump the coal into the sixty-ton train cars. This back-and-forth wasted a lot of manpower, equipment, and time. After discovering this problem, under the leadership of the Party branch and together with the technicians, we spent a day and a night improving the "pressing beam" distance of the tippler, making it possible to tip over train cars of any specification at once, increasing unloading efficiency by twelve times. As a result, the direct transfer volume of vehicles and ships in the entire district increased by 16.7% compared to the same period last year.
    This matter has enlightened us: there is no end to equipment innovation. We must break superstitions, liberate our minds, and continuously improve its structure realistically, so that it can be continuously improved to exert greater effectiveness.

### 革新无止境  潜力无穷尽

    革新无止境  潜力无穷尽
    我们开的是又土又洋的翻车机，它只要两分钟，就能一下子把六十吨煤炭从火车皮里倒到电动装煤车里，然后再装进船舱里。效率这样高的设备，我们过去一直认为无法再革新了；可是，党教育我们破除迷信，解放思想，我们就在这个洋机器上动了脑筋，结果发现它还有毛病：原来它只能翻三十至六十吨的车皮，其他种规格的车皮不能翻，还得用人力把煤炭从车皮里卸到贮煤场，然后再用机器把煤倒在六十吨的车皮里，这样倒来倒去，耗费大量人力、设备和时间。发现这个毛病后，我们就在党支部的领导下，和技术人员一起，用了一天一夜的工夫，改进了翻车机的
  “压梁”距离，作到了什么规格的运煤车皮，都能一下子翻过来，卸煤效率提高了十二倍。这样一来，全区车船直接换装量就比去年同期提高了百分之十六点七。
    这件事情，给我们的启示是：设备的革新是没有止境的，必须破除迷信，解放思想，实事求是地不断改进它的结构，使它不断完善，以发挥更大的效用。
