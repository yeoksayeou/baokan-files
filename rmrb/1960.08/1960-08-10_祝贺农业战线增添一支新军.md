Congratulations to the Agricultural Front for Adding a New Force

A large group of new-type farmers have graduated from agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu, Hebei, Shaanxi, and other provinces. They will stay in the countryside to work according to the needs of the people's communes. The great ranks of building a new socialist countryside have added a fresh force. We can fully understand that the broad cadres and members of the people's communes will greet these new soldiers with the feeling of "a loving mother leaning on the door, hoping for her child's return."

These first graduates of agricultural middle schools are imbued with a strong rural flavor, but radiate the brilliance of the Party's educational policy. They have learned many things that past middle school students, university students, and even researchers have not come into contact with. They can learn by doing, using both their brains and hands. Most students have learned book knowledge very well, and their scores in Chinese, mathematics, physics, and chemistry are all above 80 or 90. Not only that, they have also learned production knowledge and skills in major crops and animal husbandry. Some of them can make indigenous fertilizers and pesticides, and repair agricultural implements; some have mastered the basic techniques of electric motors, diesel engines, lathes, and bench vises. More valuable is that many students have developed a spirit of hard work and plain living, love labor, and love the collective. They have great ambitions to build a new socialist and communist countryside, and are determined to be red in the countryside and specialized in the countryside. They want to dedicate all their wisdom and youthful vitality to the countryside, and be good sons and daughters of Chinese peasants who are diligent, brave, and ambitious.

There is a saying: "The countryside cannot retain middle school students." In the old society, many people were influenced by the ideology of the exploiting classes, and studying was for the purpose of becoming officials and getting rich. It was difficult for the countryside to retain intellectuals. But in the new China, the purpose of education is to cultivate laborers with socialist and communist consciousness and culture. Agricultural middle schools are places to cultivate talents for the countryside. Naturally, most of these agricultural middle school graduates should stay in the countryside to work and labor. In the future, more middle school students and university students will go to the countryside, but at that time the number will not be in the thousands or tens of thousands, but in the millions and tens of millions. With the development of the rural economy, every farmer will become an all-rounder who uses both his hands and brain. The Party attaches great importance to agriculture and regards agriculture as the foundation for the development of the national economy. The socialist construction cannot be completely victorious unless the peasant problem is thoroughly solved (including politics, economy, and culture). It is for this reason that the Party has taken a series of effective measures to rapidly develop agricultural production and change the poor and blank face of the countryside. Every year, the Party sends a large number of cadres, university students, technical talents, and construction talents from other fields to go deep into the countryside, on the one hand to temper themselves, and at the same time to invest their knowledge and skills into the torrent of rural construction. Recently, a new upsurge of supporting agricultural production has been set off across the country. All walks of life are contributing to the countryside, and everyone wants to contribute a little to accelerate rural construction. This is the call of the Party and also the wish of the people of the whole country. The talents cultivated by agricultural middle schools should of course stay in the countryside.

At present, our countryside can not only retain a middle school student, but also retain millions of middle school students. The situation of rural construction requires accelerating the realization of agricultural technical transformation; agricultural production, farmland water conservancy, fertilizer production, soil improvement, variety cultivation, plant protection, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, etc. all require technology, and eliminating illiteracy, popularizing education, scientific research, mass literature and art, and health work, etc., all require rapid progress to keep up with the pace of production and construction. To do these tasks well, it is unimaginable to lack cultured and knowledgeable talents. Our countryside is a countryside full of revolutionary vigor, a place where heroes can use their talents. Ambitious rural educated youth will be duty-bound to devote themselves to rural construction.

Let us once again congratulate the first graduates of agricultural middle schools, congratulate you on successfully completing your junior high school courses and learning labor skills. In the construction of a new socialist countryside, continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work and plain living, combine daring to think and act with working hard, diligently labor and work, persevere in learning, emit greater light and heat, and create newer achievements. Let the furnace of building a new socialist countryside temper you to be stronger and more promising, and become pioneers in building a new socialist and communist countryside.

### 祝贺农业战线增添一支新军

    祝贺农业战线增添一支新军
    一大批新型的农民，从江苏、河北、陕西等地的农业中学毕业了。他们将按照人民公社的需要，留在农村工作。建设社会主义新农村的伟大行列增添了生力军。我们完全可以理解人民公社的广大干部和社员将以“慈母倚门盼，儿归娘喜欢”的心情来迎接这批新战士。
    这些农业中学的首届毕业生，他们身上沾着浓烈的乡土气息，但是，放射着党的教育方针的光辉。他们学到了不少过去的中学生、大学生、甚至研究员所没有接触过的东西。他们能学会做，既动脑又动手。多数学生对书本知识学得很好，语文和数理化的考试成绩，都在八、九十分以上。不仅如此，他们还学到了主要农作物和畜牧饲养等方面的生产知识和技能。其中一些人会制造土化肥、土农药，会修理农具；有一些人掌握电动机、柴油机、车床、钳床的基本技术。更可贵的是许多学生都培养起艰苦朴素的作风，热爱劳动，热爱集体。他们怀着建设社会主义和共产主义新农村的大志，决心红在农村，专在农村。他们要把一切的智慧和青春活力献给农村，要作勤劳勇敢而有志气的中国农民的好儿女。
    有一种这样的说法：“农村留不住个中学生”。在旧社会，许多人受了剥削阶级思想的影响，读书是为了升官发财，农村是很难留得住知识分子的。但是在新中国，教育目的是培养有社会主义共产主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，农业中学是为农村培养人材的地方，这批农业中学毕业生，自然应当绝大部分留在农村劳动和工作。将来，还要有更多的中学生、大学生到农村，不过那时人数将不是以千计，也不是以万计，而是以百万、千万计。随着农村经济的发展，将来每一个农民都会成为手脑并用的全材。党是十分重视农业的，把农业作为国民经济发展的基础。农民问题不彻底解决（包括政治、经济、文化），社会主义建设就不能彻底胜利。正因为这个缘故，党采取了一系列的有效措施，迅速发展农业生产，改变农村一穷二白的面貌。党每年还要派大批干部、大学生、技术人材以及其他各方面的建设人材深入农村，一方面为了锻炼自己，同时也就把自己的知识、技能投入农村建设的洪流。最近以来，全国掀起了支援农业生产的新高潮，各行各业都为农村出力，人人都要为加速农村建设贡献一点一滴的力量。这是党的号召，也是全国人民的心愿。农业中学培养出来的人材当然要留在农村。
    目前，我们的农村不仅留得住一个中学生，也留得住千百万个中学生。农村建设形势要求加速实现农业技术改造；农业生产、农田水利、肥料生产、土壤改良、品种培育、植物保护、畜牧兽医等等都需要技术，而扫除文盲、普及教育、科学研究、群众文艺和卫生工作等等，也无一不要求迅速跟上生产建设的步伐。要做好这些工作，缺乏有文化、有知识的人材，是难以想像的。我们的农村，是充满了革命朝气的农村，正是英雄用武之地。有志气的农村知识青年，将责无旁贷地投身农村建设。
    让我们再次向农业中学的首届毕业生祝贺，祝贺你们在胜利地完成初中课程和学会劳动本领以后，在建设社会主义新农村中，继续发扬艰苦朴素作风，把敢想敢干和埋头苦干结合起来，勤勤恳恳地劳动和工作，坚持不懈地学习，发出更大的光和热，创造更新的成就。让建设社会主义新农村的洪炉，把你们锻炼得更坚强，更有为，成为建设社会主义和共产主义新农村的先锋。
