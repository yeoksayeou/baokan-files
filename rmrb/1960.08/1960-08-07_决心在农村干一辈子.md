    Determined to Work in the Countryside for a Lifetime

    Before liberation, I was a poor child who herded cattle for landlords and only attended private school for a few years. After liberation, the Party, in order to cultivate me, sent me to Hubei Agricultural Technical School, where I learned some skills to serve the people. In the autumn of 1958, I returned to the countryside. Since then, I have been working as an agricultural technology extension worker in the Tiantang Production Team of the Luotuo'ao Commune in Luotian County. Over the past year, I have been continuously tempered in the crucible of the countryside. I have fallen in love with my work and the place where I work.

    Here, agricultural machinery is increasing year by year; before long, the electricity from the Bailianhe Hydropower Station will be sent to us. Many new scientific and technological achievements are also being increasingly widely used in production. I also deeply feel that the countryside has an urgent need for cultural and scientific knowledge. I am willing to work in the countryside for a lifetime, and together with the broad masses, use my own hands and wisdom to build our countryside even more beautifully.

    决心在农村干一辈子
    解放前，我是一个给地主放牛的穷孩子，只读过几年私塾。解放后，党为了培养我，把我送到湖北农业技术学校，学到了一些为人民服务的本领。一九五八年秋，我回到了农村。从那时起，我一直在罗田县骆驼坳公社天堂生产队做农业技术推广工作。一年多来，在农村这个熔炉里，我得到不断的锻炼。我爱上了我的工作和我工作的地方。
    我们这里，农业机械一年年在增加；过不了多久，白莲河水电站的电，就要送到我们这里来了。许多新的科学技术也正日益广泛地在生产中运用。我也深深感到，农村对文化科学知识的要求是迫切的。我愿意在农村干一辈子，和广大群众一起，用自己的双手和智慧，把我们的农村建设得更加美好。
