    Summer in the Urban People's Communes
    The scorching sun blazes, and the heat is stifling. In the urban people's communes of Beijing, whether you step into a commune-run factory or visit a public canteen, kindergarten, or service station, you see people working selflessly everywhere, and the atmosphere is as close as family.
    Announcing Good News in the Dog Days of Summer
    Just as it was time to get off work, drumbeats like popping beans echoed into the Chunshu People's Commune Party Committee. The women who came to report good news from the commune's glass factory crowded the courtyard in the drizzling rain. Standing on the steps, Zhang Zhi, the Party Committee Secretary of the commune, received the red certificate of merit amidst enthusiastic applause. He said excitedly: "Congratulations to you for completing the July production plan three days ahead of schedule. I hope that the products produced in August will be of better quality and have more varieties and specifications. Create new achievements." Immediately afterward, the factory director of this factory, holding the newly unveiled red banner, faced everyone and shouted: "Can we achieve the new instructions of the Party Committee!" As soon as he finished speaking, all the production personnel answered in unison: "Yes!"
    There's a story behind announcing the good news here.
    On July 21, the Commune Party Committee issued a call to fight for high production in the dog days of summer, and posted a red banner for each factory, stipulating that the factory that completed the production plan ahead of schedule would take it down to report the good news. From that time on, more than a dozen factories and more than four thousand production personnel in the entire commune were determined to be the first to unveil the red banner.
    The employees of the Commune Glass Factory, who won the honorary title of advanced collective in Beijing in 1959, were of course unwilling to lag behind in this competition, and everyone was determined to work hard. However, the summer heat was unbearable. In their high-temperature workshop for producing glass instruments, the temperature was very high, and they were sweating profusely even without production. At this time, He Xiaozhu, the Party Branch Secretary on the front line of production, immediately asked the production management personnel to completely solve the problem of heatstroke prevention and cooling. On Sunday, the branch secretary personally led the civil engineers to build skylights and dig ventilation holes for the workshop, and installed exhaust fans, and the indoor temperature immediately dropped. Everyone was extremely excited, and they all said happily: "This time it's good, we won't sweat while working, and we will guarantee to be the first to unveil the big red banner!" They did what they said. The daily output in late July did indeed increase more than twofold compared to early July.
    Taking the high-temperature workshop as an example, other workshops also adopted comprehensive cooling measures, and all production management personnel above the workshop director level "settled" in the workshop. These things greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the production personnel. These days, the factory announcer constantly broadcasts exciting news: the newly trial-produced products such as mercury switches, dropping bottles, and volumetric flasks have been put into production, and the output is increasing every day. The production team that made dropping bottles in the instrument workshop won the factory's production championship, with a daily output exceeding the plan by 250%.

### 三伏天里揭红榜

    盛夏在城市人民公社里
    烈日炎炎，暑气逼人。在北京的城市人民公社里，不论走进社办工厂，还是到公共食堂、幼儿园或服务站，到处都可看到忘我劳动的人们，到处都是亲如家人的情景。
    三伏天里揭红榜
    刚到下班时，爆豆似的鼓声传进了椿树人民公社党委会。从公社玻璃厂来报捷的妇女，冒着蒙蒙细雨挤满了院子。站在台阶上的公社党委书记张志在一阵热烈的掌声中，接过来红色的捷报。他兴奋地说：“祝贺你们提前三天完成7月份生产计划，希望在8月份生产的产品，质量更好，品种规格更多。创造出新的成绩。”紧接着，这个厂的厂长拿着刚刚揭下来的红榜，面对大家放开嗓门说：“我们能不能实现党委的新指示！”话音刚落，全体生产人员异口同声地回答：“能！”
    谈起揭红榜，这里有段故事。
    7月21日，公社党委提出大战三伏夺高产的号召，并给每个厂贴上一张红榜，规定由提前完成生产计划的工厂揭下来报捷。从那时起，全公社十多个工厂四千多生产人员都立下决心要抢先揭红榜。
    获得1959年北京市先进集体光荣称号的公社玻璃厂职工，在这次竞赛中，当然不甘落后，大家都憋足了劲想大干一场。可是，盛夏的炎热不由人，她们生产玻璃仪器的高温车间，温度很高，不用生产就热得汗流浃背。这时，在生产第一线上的党支部书记贺小柱，就马上找生产管理人员彻底解决防暑降温问题。星期天，支部书记亲自领着土木工，为车间打天窗，挖通风洞，又按上排风扇，屋内温度立即下降。这一下，大家兴奋极了，都兴高彩烈地说：“这回可好啦，干活不流汗，保证抢先揭下大红榜！”她们说到那里就做到那里。7月下旬的日产量果然比上旬猛增两倍多。
    以高温车间为榜样，其他车间也采取了综合降温措施，车间主任以上的生产管理人员全部到车间“落户”，这些事情大大鼓舞起生产人员的干劲。这些天，工厂广播员不断地播出令人振奋的消息：试制的新产品水银开关、滴瓶、量瓶等投入生产后，产量天天上升。仪器车间制作滴瓶的生产小组夺得全厂生产冠军，日产量超过计划250％。
