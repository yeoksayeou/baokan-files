In the movement to increase production and practice economy, what is the most important task for small-scale iron and steel enterprises in various provinces and cities? It is to strive to improve the quality of pig iron and achieve high quality, high yield, and low consumption, so as to support key steel enterprises with more and better pig iron.

On the basis of the Great Leap Forward of the past two years, China's small-scale, Western-method ironmaking enterprises have made new leaps forward this year. With the deepening of the technological innovation and technological revolution movements, the production capacity of small blast furnaces has been greatly improved, and many red flag ironmaking plants and red flag furnaces with high quality, high yield, and low consumption have emerged in various places. Small-scale ironmaking enterprises are undertaking increasingly important tasks in China's socialist construction. According to the national plan, the pig iron produced by small blast furnaces will account for more than half of the total pig iron output this year. Precisely because of this, the state and the people have higher and higher demands on small-scale ironmaking enterprises. Especially since the launch of the movement to increase production and practice economy, with grain and steel as the center, the objective situation of continued leaps forward more prominently requires small-scale ironmaking enterprises to strive to improve the quality of pig iron while increasing output, so as to ensure the needs of a substantial increase in steel output in the next four months.

While we demand to improve the quality of pig iron, we also demand a substantial increase in the output of pig iron. Can these two be carried out simultaneously? The answer is undoubtedly yes. The news published in this newspaper on August 21 about the simultaneous leap forward in pig iron quality and output in Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province, is a good example. The experience of Zhangjiakou City proves that as long as we establish a comprehensive production viewpoint, master the temperament of small blast furnaces, understand the internal connection between improving quality and increasing output in the smelting process, and actively take measures to solve specific contradictions, quality and output can be leapt forward simultaneously. We should see the contradictory aspects of increasing output and improving quality, in order to better overcome this contradiction. More importantly, we should see that in many cases, there is unity between increasing output and improving quality. This unity is not only reflected in the purpose of production, that is, our products must be both numerous and good, but also in the production process, this unity is often present. For example, improving quality and increasing output both rely on the implementation of advanced operating methods. Measures to improve quality are generally conducive to increasing output; measures to increase output, under normal circumstances, are also conducive to improving quality. For example, washing coal can reduce ash and sulfur content, which is an important measure to improve the quality of pig iron; at the same time, because the raw coal is washed, the strength of coke is improved, the use of limestone can be reduced, and it is also conducive to increasing the output of pig iron. Another example is that roasting ore can improve the grade of ore, which is an important measure to increase the output of pig iron; at the same time, because the ore is roasted, impurities and sulfur content are reduced, which is also conducive to improving the quality of pig iron. It can be seen from this that only seeing the contradiction between improving quality and increasing output, but not seeing the consistency between improving quality and increasing output, is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the objective laws of production, or it can be said that the production reality has not been deeply understood.

Of course, there are some objective reasons why the quality of pig iron in some units has not improved rapidly or has fluctuated. For example: due to changes in raw materials, the law of batching has not been found for a while; some coal and ore have too high sulfur content, which increases the difficulty of desulfurization in ironmaking; in the case that raw materials cannot meet the needs of a substantial increase in production, some inferior coal and inferior coke are mixed in, and so on. However, these objective conditions can be changed through human efforts. Production management work should be improved with the changes in objective conditions, actively overcome some unfavorable factors in the progress, and actively organize new balances. Now, we have had more than two years of mass steelmaking practice, and generally have accumulated some effective operating techniques and production management experience; many small blast furnaces have undergone technological transformation, increased air volume, and increased air temperature; in the technological innovation and technological revolution movements, workers have created many new desulfurization technologies and new experiences. As long as we make full use of these favorable conditions, it is entirely possible to further improve the quality of pig iron while increasing the output of pig iron.

To implement the principle of giving equal importance to quality and output, the key lies in implementing political leadership, establishing a comprehensive production viewpoint among all cadres and workers, and promoting the communist style of "leaving difficulties to ourselves and sending convenience to others." In this regard, some vivid and effective methods can be adopted, such as organizing workers from raw material production units to visit ironmaking plants, organizing workers from ironmaking plants to visit steel plants, holding exhibitions of superior and inferior products, etc., to educate workers in the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical, and comprehensive leap forward, so that the ideas of giving equal importance to quality and quantity, "good materials guarantee good iron," and "good iron guarantees good steel" are deeply rooted in people's hearts. At the same time, the principle of giving equal importance to quality and quantity should be specifically reflected in all aspects of work such as arranging production plans, formulating technical measures, improving production management, and organizing competitions. When considering increasing production, we must consider improving quality, and when issuing output targets, we must have specific requirements for quality; similarly, when considering quality, we must also consider output, and when making demands on quality, we must not ignore output. Under no circumstances should one aspect be emphasized while ignoring the other.

What specific measures should be taken to further improve the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces? According to the experience of Zhangjiakou City, efforts should be made in three aspects: raw material management, furnace front operation, and equipment maintenance, among which strengthening raw material management is particularly important. The central requirement for improving the quality of pig iron lies in minimizing the sulfur content in pig iron. Sulfur comes from coke and from ore. To eliminate it, we must first control the raw materials and limit its entry into the furnace. This is the same as the principle of "prevention first" in health work. If the prevention work is done well, the task of treatment will be greatly reduced; desulfurization before smelting, the contradiction is single, the operation is simple, and the effect is doubled; bringing a large amount of sulfur into the furnace for treatment will cause a series of changes in slagging and batching in the furnace, which is much more complicated than desulfurization before smelting. The successful experience of small blast furnaces in many places shows that the basic requirement of raw material management is "make fine food from coarse grain" and "make exquisite food from fine grain," so that the blast furnace eats fine grain and eats cooked materials. Achieving these will provide the most basic guarantee for improving the quality of pig iron. But this requires a series of detailed work. In addition to the efforts to improve product quality in each link of coal mining, coal washing, coking, mining, mineral processing, and sintering, from the perspective of ironmaking plants, the main thing is to grasp the five links of roasting, crushing, washing, weighing, and loading, remove the "four pests" of mud, soil, foam, and miscellaneous (impurities), implement particle size classification, quality classification, mixed storage, material determination by furnace, and strengthen furnace material testing. The above-mentioned measures are the fundamental measures to improve the quality of pig iron and increase the output of pig iron. After layers of checks and layers of measures, most of the sulfur content in the raw materials is removed, and the remaining sulfur content must be treated during the smelting process. The successful experience of small blast furnaces in many places shows that improving desulfurization efficiency in smelting, that is, the central link in increasing the output of pig iron, is to implement the operating method of high smelting intensity, high air temperature, and large air volume; secondly, it is necessary to strengthen technical management, improve operating procedures, establish a responsibility system, and establish a good production order. To ensure the continuous high quality and high yield of small blast furnaces, it is also necessary to strengthen equipment maintenance, formulate reasonable maintenance procedures, prepare necessary spare parts and components, and do everything possible to fight against accidents. Doing these tasks well can ensure the normal operation of the machine and the continuous flow of molten iron from the blast furnace.

In order to do these tasks well, all enterprises must fully mobilize the masses, adopt the method of "three combinations" of leading cadres, workers, and engineering and technical personnel, focus on the key and weak links of production, vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, strengthen production management work in a down-to-earth manner, conquer one level and consolidate it, and continuously sum up experience and continuously promote improvement.

Now, the vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy, centered on grain and steel, is gradually unfolding. As one of the main forces in this movement, the workers of small ironmaking enterprises should take advantage of the great situation, muster greater efforts, further improve the quality and output of pig iron, and create more brilliant achievements in completing and overfulfilling this year's steel production plan in our country.

    力争小高炉生铁质量更好产量更高
    在增产节约运动中，什么是各省市小型炼铁企业最重要的任务呢？是努力提高生铁质量，实现优质、高产、低消耗，以更多更好的生铁支援重点炼钢企业。
    在两年大跃进的基础上，我国小型的、用洋法生产的炼铁企业今年又有了新的跃进。随着技术革新和技术革命运动的深入开展，小高炉的生产能力已有了大幅度的提高，各地都出现了不少优质高产低消耗的红旗炼铁厂和红旗炉。小型炼铁企业在我国社会主义建设中担负的任务越来越重大，按照国家计划，今年小高炉生产的生铁占全部生铁产量的一半以上。正是由于这样，国家和人民对小型炼铁企业的要求越来越高。特别是以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动开展以后，继续跃进的客观形势更突出地要求小型炼铁企业，必须在提高产量的同时，努力提高生铁的质量，以保证今后四个月钢产量大幅度增长的需要。
    我们在要求提高生铁质量的同时，还要求大幅度地提高生铁的产量。这两者可以同时并举吗？回答无疑是肯定的。8月21日本报发表的河北省张家口市生铁质量产量同时跃进的消息，就是一个很好的例证。张家口市的经验证明，只要我们树立了全面生产观点，掌握了小高炉的脾气，了解了冶炼过程中提高质量和增加产量的内在联系，积极采取措施解决具体矛盾，质量和产量完全可以同时跃进。我们应当看到增加产量和提高质量的矛盾的方面，为的是更好地克服这个矛盾，更重要的，则是要看到在许多情况下，增加产量和提高质量的统一的方面。这种统一性，不仅仅表现在生产的目的上，即我们的产品必须要又多又好，而且在生产过程中，这种统一性也是经常存在的。例如提高质量和增加产量都有赖于贯彻先进的操作方法。提高质量的措施一般都有利于增加产量；增加产量的措施，在正常情况下也都有利于提高质量。例如，洗煤可以减少灰分、硫分，是提高生铁质量的重要措施；同时，由于原煤经过洗选，提高了焦炭强度，可以少用石灰石，又有利于提高生铁产量。又如，焙烧矿石，可以提高矿石品位，是提高生铁产量的重要措施；同时，由于矿石经过焙烧，减少了杂质和硫分，也有利于提高生铁质量。由此可见，只看到提高质量和增加产量有矛盾，而看不到提高质量和增加产量有一致的地方，是对生产的客观规律性还没有全面认识，或者说是对生产实际还没有深知深解。
    当然，有些单位生铁质量提高得不快或者发生波动，也有某些客观原因。比如：由于原材料改变，一时还没有摸到配料规律；有些煤炭、矿石含硫量过高，给炼铁脱硫增加了困难；在原材料不能满足生产大幅度增长需要的情况下，掺用了一些次煤、次焦等等。但是，这些客观条件经过人的努力是可以改变的。生产管理工作应当随着客观情况的变化而改进，积极克服前进中的一些不利因素，积极组织新的平衡。现在，我们有了两年多的群众大办钢铁的实践，一般都积累了一些行之有效的操作技术经验和生产管理经验；许多小高炉实行了技术改造，增加了风量，提高了风温；在技术革新、技术革命运动中，职工们创造了许多脱硫的新技术、新经验。只要我们充分利用这些有利条件，完全可能在提高生铁产量的同时进一步提高生铁的质量。
    贯彻质量、产量并举的方针，关键在于实行政治挂帅，在全体干部和职工中，树立全面的生产观点，发扬“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”的共产主义风格。在这方面，可以采取一些生动有效的办法，比如通过组织原料生产单位职工到炼铁厂参观，组织炼铁厂职工到钢厂参观，举办优劣产品展览会等，向职工进行多快好省、全面跃进的教育，使质量、数量并举，“好料保好铁”，“好铁保好钢”的思想深入人心。同时，要在安排生产计划、制订技术措施、改进生产管理、组织竞赛等各项工作中具体体现质量、数量并举的方针。在考虑增产时一定要考虑到提高质量，下达产量指标时一定要有对质量的具体要求；同样，在考虑质量时也要考虑产量，对质量提出要求时，也不要忽视产量。在任何情况下，都不可强调一个方面，而忽视另一个方面。
    采取什么具体措施来进一步提高小高炉生铁质量？根据张家口市的经验，要从原料管理、炉前操作、设备维修三个方面下功夫，其中加强原料管理尤为重要。提高生铁质量的中心要求就在于最大限度地降低生铁中的含硫量。硫，来自焦炭，来自矿石，要消除它，首先应当把住原料关，限制它入炉。这同卫生工作贯彻“以预防为主”的方针一样，防的工作做好了，治疗的任务就大大减少了；从原料上把硫消除到最低限度，冶炼中的脱硫就比较好办了。在冶炼前脱硫，矛盾是单一的，操作简单，事半功倍；把大量硫分带到炉内去处理，就要引起炉内造渣配料上一系列的变化，就比冶炼前脱硫复杂得多。许多地方小高炉的成功经验表明：原料管理的基本要求是“粗粮细作”，“细粮精作”，让高炉吃细粮、吃熟料。做到了这一些，生铁质量的提高就有了最基本的保证。但这必须进行一系列的细致的工作。除了采煤、洗煤、炼焦、采矿、选矿、烧结各个环节上都要努力提高产品质量以外，从炼铁厂来说，主要是抓住焙烧、破碎、洗选、过磅、上料五个环节，除掉泥、土、沫、杂（杂质）“四害”，实行粒度分级、质量分类、混匀储存、以炉定料、加强炉料化验。上面说的这些措施是提高生铁质量、增加生铁产量的根本措施。经过层层把关，层层采取措施，把原料中的硫分去掉了绝大部分，其余的硫分要在冶炼过程中去处理。许多地方小高炉的成功经验说明：在冶炼中提高脱硫效率，也就是提高生铁产量的中心环节，是实行高冶炼强度、高风温、大风量的操作方法；其次要加强技术管理，健全操作规程，建立责任制度，树立良好的生产秩序。要保证小高炉持续优质高产，还必须加强设备维修工作，制订合理的检修规程，准备必要的备品、备件，千方百计向事故作斗争。做好了这些工作，就能使机器正常运转，使高炉铁水长流。
    为了做好这些工作，各个企业必须充分发动群众，采用领导干部同工人、工程技术人员“三结合”的方法，围绕生产关键和薄弱环节，大搞技术革新和技术革命，踏踏实实地加强生产管理工作，攻克一关就巩固一关，并且不断总结经验，不断推广提高。
    现在，以粮、钢为中心的轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，正在逐步展开，作为这个运动中的主力军之一的各个小型炼铁企业的职工，应当乘着大好形势，鼓起更大干劲，进一步提高生铁的质量和产量，在完成和超额完成今年我国钢铁生产计划中创立更加辉煌的功绩。
