Chad is located in the inland of Central Africa, covering an area of 1.28 million square kilometers with a population of 2.57 million.

From 1902, Chad became a French colony. Chad's economy is very backward, with agriculture and animal husbandry being the economic foundation of the country. Agricultural products include cotton, peanuts, and rice. Cotton accounts for 79% of total exports, but it is entirely monopolized by the French African Cotton Company, a French monopoly capital enterprise. Under the long-term plunder of France, the income of the Chadian people is meager, and their lives are extremely painful.

The Chadian people have a glorious tradition of resisting colonialists, and the people's struggle against colonialism has never been interrupted. Since World War II, the Chadian people's struggle for independence has been on the rise. Under these circumstances, in order to continue to maintain its colonial rule, the French colonialists gave Chad the status of a "semi-autonomous republic" in 1957 according to the so-called "Basic Law" of overseas territories, and in 1958, they declared Chad as an "autonomous republic" within the "French Community". In June 1959, the Chadian people held large-scale demonstrations against the "French Community." The French colonialists carried out bloody suppression of the unarmed Chadian people, causing more than 400 African deaths and injuries. Due to the heroic struggle of the Chadian people, the French colonialists now have to agree to Chad's declaration of independence within the "French Community." (Hong) (Attached picture)

    乍得
    乍得在中非内陆，面积一百二十八万平方公里，人口二百五十七万。
    1902年起，乍得沦为法国的殖民地。乍得经济十分落后，农牧业是这个国家的经济基础。农产品有棉花、花生、大米等。棉花在对外贸易中占出口总额的79％，但是全部为法国垄断资本经营的法属非洲棉花公司所垄断。在法国的长期掠夺下，乍得人民收入低微，生活极端痛苦。
    乍得人民具有反抗殖民者的光荣斗争传统，人民反殖民主义的斗争从未间断。第二次世界大战以来，乍得人民争取独立的斗争更加高涨。在这种情况下，法国殖民者为了继续保持其殖民统治，在1957年根据所谓海外领地“根本法”给乍得以“半自治共和国”的地位，在1958年又宣布乍得为“法兰西共同体”内的“自治共和国”。1959年6月，乍得人民又为反对“法兰西共同体”举行了大规模的示威游行。法国殖民者对赤手空拳的乍得人民进行了血腥镇压，非洲人死伤共四百多人。由于乍得人民的英勇斗争，法国殖民者现在不得不同意乍得宣告在“法兰西共同体”内独立。　　　　　（洪）（附图片）
