    Xinhua News Agency, August 28th - The China-Korea Friendship Association held a reception this afternoon to bid farewell to the entire delegation of the Korea-China Friendship Association, headed by Kim Jong-heng.

    Lao She, Vice President of the China-Korea Friendship Association, spoke at the reception. He said that the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, forged in blood, is as evergreen as the pines of Changbai Mountain and as ceaseless as the blue waters of the Yalu River.

    Lao She warmly praised the Korean people's contributions to defending peace in Asia and the world. He pointed out that our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, still occupies South Korea, still occupies China's territory of Taiwan, and is actively expanding its military and preparing for war, piecing together military blocs, and threatening peace in Asia and the world. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese and Korean people. The beautiful three thousand li of rivers and mountains of Korea must be unified, China's territory of Taiwan must be liberated, and U.S. imperialism's war policies and aggressive conspiracies must be exposed and attacked. The Chinese and Korean people will forever hold high the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, closely unite, and fight together for socialist construction and against U.S. imperialist aggression.

    Kim Jong-heng, head of the Korea-China Friendship Association delegation, spoke. He said that through this visit, we have more deeply realized the deep friendship and solid unity between the Korean and Chinese people.

    He said that during our visit, we personally witnessed the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people in the great leap forward of socialist construction under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party. Today, the vast land of China is overflowing with joy and hope, full of vigorous creative power. In factories, enterprises, and people's communes, production is developing by leaps and bounds, and new achievements are being created in the technological revolution.

    He said that all the achievements made by the Korean and Chinese people in socialist construction have made great contributions to strengthening the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. No struggle by U.S. imperialism can stop our progress.

    He said that the Korean people will surely force U.S. imperialism to get out of South Korea and realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and Taiwan will surely return to the embrace of the 650 million Chinese people.

    Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yong-ho, was invited to attend the reception.

    Also attending the reception were Zhang Zhixiang, Qu Wu, Dong Chuncai, Wei Zhenwu, Wei Chuantong, Hu Jiwei, Cao Mengjun, Zhou Weizhi, Li Qiangfen, Xin Yi, Huang Luofeng, Xia Nai, Wang Jiong, Zhao Biao, and others.

    老舍热情地赞扬朝鲜人民对捍卫亚洲和世界和平所作出的贡献。他指出，我们的共同敌人美帝国主义还霸占着南朝鲜，还霸占着中国的领土台湾，还积极扩军备战，拼凑军事集团，威胁亚洲和世界和平，这是中朝两国人民绝对不能容忍的。朝鲜的三千里锦绣河山一定要实现统一，中国的领土台湾一定要获得解放，美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略阴谋必须予以揭露和打击。中朝两国人民将永远高举伟大的马克思列宁主义旗帜，为社会主义建设、为反对美帝国主义侵略而紧密团结、共同奋斗。

    他说，我们在参观中亲眼看到了中国人民在伟大的中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设的大跃进中取得的辉煌成就。今天，辽阔的中国大地上，洋溢着欢乐和希望，充满着生气勃勃的创造力量。在工厂企业和人民公社，生产在飞跃发展，在技术革命中正在创造新的成就。
    他说，朝中两国人民在社会主义建设中取得的一切成就，为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力，作出了很大的贡献。美帝国主义的任何挣扎，也不能阻挡我们的前进。
    他说，朝鲜人民必将迫使美帝国主义滚出南朝鲜，实现祖国的和平统一，台湾必将回到六亿五千万中国人民的怀抱里。
