    Revolutionary Ambition, Revolutionary Perseverance
    Yu Yide
    The People's Daily reprinted an article from "Liberation" magazine on August 13th, titled "To Engage in Revolution, One Must Have Revolutionary Ambition"; this is indeed a good article. It is thought-provoking and inspiring.
      The idiom "striving for progress" is known to every household, but not everyone necessarily understands its profound meaning. This article points out at the outset that striving for progress is revolutionary ambition. With revolutionary ambition, there will be revolutionary drive, a spirit of hard work, and unwavering revolutionary steadfastness. Standing at the height of the communist ideal of this era, this article imbues the idiom "striving for progress" with new vitality, expressing a truth that everyone holds in their hearts but cannot articulate.
    "Fen" (愤) is a sense of injustice. Only with this sense of injustice in one's heart can one be motivated to strive, and only through striving can one achieve. Throughout history, both ancient and modern, both in China and abroad, all who have accomplished great things and established great undertakings have done so as a result of striving for progress. Tang Xuanzang was "angered" by the difficulty of obtaining true scriptures, so he traveled to the Western Regions to obtain them. He encountered numerous difficulties on the way, endured all kinds of hardships, and finally obtained more than 600 Buddhist scriptures, writing a brilliant page in the history of Sino-Indian cultural exchange. Li Shizhen was "angered" by the backwardness of medicine at the time, and by alchemists who deceived people with cinnabar and gold elixirs. Therefore, he traversed mountains and rivers, traveled thousands of miles, read extensively, interviewed widely, and spent thirty years writing the immortal masterpiece "Compendium of Materia Medica." They knew what to be "angered" about and therefore strived for progress. As a result, they had the determination never to stop until their goals were achieved, a tenacious and unyielding perseverance, and never retreated a step in the face of all kinds of hardships. With such a spirit of striving, how could they not achieve great things?
    However, all of this is "now in the past." What we should be "angered" about today is that the "poor and blank" state left to us by the long-term rule of foreign imperialism and domestic feudal forces has not been fundamentally changed. Therefore, American imperialism still dares to bully us, and "Heaven" still dares to bully us. We are unwilling to accept this bullying and must therefore strive for progress. During the democratic revolution, we were "angered" by the oppression of the three major enemies and were unwilling to accept a semi-feudal and semi-colonial status. The people of the whole country, with the hard work of the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains, charged forward and bravely advanced, finally removing the three great mountains that were weighing on the Chinese people. Now we are striving to change the "poor and blank" face of our country, and we still need to carry forward the same hard work that we used to remove the three great mountains. We must be aware of the heavy burdens we bear and also see the difficulties ahead. Mencius once said: "When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a person, it must first afflict his mind, exhaust his muscles and bones, starve his body, empty his frame, and disrupt his actions. In this way, he will be able to strengthen his heart, endure his nature, and increase what he is unable to do." We proletarian revolutionaries shoulder the great task of realizing communism. Of course, this is not a task "bestowed by Heaven," but a requirement of the times and the class. However, to accomplish this great task, we also need to undergo all kinds of trials and tribulations, to fight against imperialist aggression and the threat of war, to fight against modern revisionism and its followers, to fight against the influence of bourgeois political thought, to fight against natural disasters... In various struggles, the 650 million people of the country are full of vigor and high morale. The elderly are becoming stronger in their old age, with unyielding aspirations; the young people have wills that are stronger than steel, and are not afraid of failing a hundred times, but will still try a thousand times. With such ambition that cannot be moved by the wind, with such determination that cannot be destroyed by fire, we will eventually bid farewell to "poverty and blankness" and realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, and science and culture.
    The People's Daily also said in "Looking Forward to the 1960s": "The great vitality of 650 million liberated people is running full speed ahead toward a fully recognized destination, along a fully recognized route, and adopting fully recognized methods." With the glorious illumination of the three red flags, with clear goals, and with the revolutionary perseverance to strive for progress and the drive to run full speed ahead, victory will surely belong to us in the competition with capitalist countries.

### 革命的志气，革命的毅力

    革命的志气，革命的毅力
    余一得
    人民日报8月13日转载《解放》杂志一篇评论，题目是《干革命就要有革命的志气》；这确是一篇好文章。耐人寻味，发人深思。
      “发愤图强”这句成语，家喻户晓，然而并不一定每个人都了解它的深刻含意。这篇文章开宗明义指出，发愤图强，就是革命的志气，有革命的志气，才会有革命的干劲，才会有艰苦奋斗的精神，才会有百折不挠的革命坚定性。这篇文章站在共产主义这一时代理想的高度，赋予“发愤图强”这句成语以新的生命力，道出了人人心中所有、笔下所无的真理。
    愤，就是一股不平之气。肚子里憋着这股不平之气，才能奋发起来，奋发而后才能有为。在古今中外历史上，成大事立大业的，哪一个不是发愤图强的结果。唐玄奘“愤”真经难得，他到西天取经，路上遇到重重困难，历尽千辛万苦，才取到了六百多部佛典，在中印文化交流史上写下辉煌的一页。李时珍“愤”当时的医学落后，方士们以丹砂、金浆骗人，于是他翻山越岭，跋涉万里，博览群书，采访四方，积三十年之久，写出了不朽巨著《本草纲目》。他们知所愤而发愤，因此，就具有不达目的决不休止的决心，顽强不屈、百折不挠的毅力，在各种各样的磨难面前，绝不后退一步。以这样的奋发精神，怎能会不大有所为呢？
    然而这一切“俱往矣”，我们今天要“愤”的是外国帝国主义、国内封建势力的长期统治所遗留给我们的“一穷二白”的状况还未根本改变，因此，美帝国主义还敢欺负我们，“天老爷”还敢欺负我们，我们不甘于这种欺负，就要发愤图强。在民主革命时期，我们“愤”三大敌人的压迫，不甘于半封建半殖民地的地位，全国人民以愚公移山的硬劲，冲锋陷阵，奋勇直前，终于搬掉了压在中国人民头上的三座大山。现在我们发愤改变“一穷二白”的面貌，仍然需要发扬搬掉三座大山的那股硬劲。我们既要意识到肩负的重担，也要看到前进中的困难。孟子曾说：“天将降大任于斯人也，必先苦其心志，劳其筋骨，饿其体肤，空乏其身，行拂乱其所为，所以顿心忍性，增益其所不能。”我们无产阶级革命者，肩负着实现共产主义的大任，当然这不是“天降”的大任，而是时代和阶级的要求，然而，我们要完成这个大任，同样需要经过各种各样的磨炼，要和帝国主义的侵略和战争威胁作斗争，要和现代修正主义及其追随者作斗争，要和资产阶级的政治思想影响作斗争，要和自然灾害作斗争……。在各种斗争中，全国六亿五千万人民，人人意气风发，斗志昂扬。年老的，老而益壮，壮心不已；年轻的，意志更比钢还坚，不怕失败一百次，还要干上一千遍。有这样的风刮不动的志气，有这样的火烧不毁的决心，我们终将和“一穷二白”告别，而实现工业、农业和科学文化的现代化。
    人民日报在《展望六十年代》一文里也说：“被解放了的六亿五千万人这样一个伟大的生命力，正在向着充分认清了的目的地，沿着充分认清了的路线，采取着充分认清了的方法，开足马力向前飞跑。”我们有着三面红旗的光辉照耀，有着明确的目标，又有着发愤图强的革命毅力，和开足马力飞跑的劲头，我们在和资本主义国家竞赛中，胜利必属于我们。
