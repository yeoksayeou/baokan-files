    Machine for Repairing Converters
    A converter lining ramming machine was successfully manufactured in the steelmaking workshop of the Qingdao Bicycle Factory after more than 30 experiments over six months.
    In the past, the steelmaking workshop of this factory repaired converters and rammed the lining entirely by manpower. Six people per shift, three shifts, could not even ram the lining of a 0.5-ton converter, and the lining rammed by hand could only be used for a maximum of 60 heats. Using the converter lining ramming machine requires only one person to operate, and the rammed lining can be used for 173 heats.

    修转炉用机器
    一台转炉炉衬捣打机，经过六个多月三十多次试验，在青岛自行车厂炼钢车间制造成功了。
    过去这个厂的炼钢车间修转炉，打炉衬完全用人力，每班六个人，三个班次还打不起一个零点五吨的转炉炉衬，而且人工打的炉衬最多只能用六十个炉次。使用炉衬捣打机，只需要一个人操作，打出的炉衬可以使用一百七十三次。
