Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd. Soong Ching Ling, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, today sent a telegram to Popova, Chairman of the Presidium of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Andreyev, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, warmly congratulating the Soviet Union on the successful launch of its second spaceship. The telegram reads as follows: Dear Comrade Popova! Dear Comrade Andreyev!

    We are delighted to learn that the second spaceship launched by the Soviet Union on August 19th has safely returned to Earth after completing its planned scientific exploration program. On behalf of all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, I extend my heartfelt and warm congratulations to you, and through you, to the Soviet people, scientists, and engineering technicians.

    The successful launch and return to Earth of the Soviet spaceship is another significant contribution of the Soviet people to scientific endeavors and a new milestone in mankind's conquest of the universe. This new initiative of the Soviet people demonstrates that the realization of mankind's desire to fly to interplanetary space is not far off.

    I wish the Soviet people new and greater achievements in the great cause of space flight!

    With friendly greetings!
      Soong Ching Ling
      President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
                    August 22, 1960

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 22nd. Shanghai scientists have expressed warm congratulations on the great achievement of Soviet scientists in creating a spaceship that successfully returned to Earth. The scientists unanimously pointed out that this is another glorious victory in mankind's struggle to conquer the universe.

Feng Depei, Vice President of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Director of the Institute of Physiology, said that in May this year, the Soviet Union successfully sent the first giant spaceship into the sky. At that time, everyone was excitedly expecting that the Soviet Union would soon launch a spaceship carrying animals that could safely return to Earth. Now, only a little more than three months later, this expectation has been realized. Feng Depei said that the successful launch of this second spaceship has extremely important scientific significance. In terms of biology alone, conducting detailed physiological observations on higher animals such as dogs for a full day and night at an altitude of 320 kilometers and in a state of complete weightlessness, and then conducting long-term follow-up observations on them after returning to Earth, will write a brand new chapter in biology and provide necessary scientific data for human flight into space.

Physiologist Zhang Xiangtong said that this time, the Soviet Union sent two dogs into space using a satellite-type spaceship and then accurately and safely landed them in a predetermined area. This is an unprecedented and great achievement in the history of science. This proves that under the incomparably superior socialist system, Soviet scientists have successfully created all the conditions necessary for higher animals to live in outer space, and have solved all the physiological difficulties that animals inevitably encounter when flying away from and returning to Earth, preparing for human space flight.

Wang Yinglai, Director of the Institute of Biochemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the successful launch of the Soviet spaceship and its return to Earth in a predetermined area once again demonstrated the high level of Soviet science and technology. In particular, the complex biological and medical exploration work carried out on animals has accumulated valuable data for space biology and medicine.

Metallurgist and Director of the Department of Metallurgy at Jiaotong University, Zhou Zhihong, said that this time, the Soviet spaceship obeyed orders and safely returned to a point about ten kilometers within the predetermined landing point. This shows that the accuracy of Soviet remote control has reached an astonishing level. In particular, the fact that the spaceship was able to pass through the Earth's atmosphere without being burned shows that the Soviet Union has unique creations in the research of heat-resistant alloys and heat protection. This is a major contribution made by Soviet metallurgists.

Wang You, Deputy Director of the Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the Soviet Union sent a spaceship weighing 4,600 kilograms into orbit and was able to freely control the operation of the spaceship and solve the measures for its return to Earth. This is an amazing feat, which includes the design of remote control and television transmission systems, the manufacture of high-temperature, low-temperature, and wear-resistant metals and organic structures and lubricating materials, and a series of other problems. These successes fully demonstrate the outstanding achievements of Soviet scientists in mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, and other related fields.

    新华社22日讯　中苏友好协会总会会长宋庆龄，今天打电报给苏联对外友好和文化联系协会联合会主席团主席波波娃和苏中友好协会理事会主席安德烈耶夫，热烈祝贺苏联发射第二个宇宙飞船成功。电文如下：亲爱的波波娃同志！亲爱的安德烈耶夫同志！
    欣闻苏联于8月19日发射的第二个宇宙飞船，在完成预计的科学考察计划之后，已安全返回地球，谨代表中苏友好协会全体会员，向你们，并通过你们，向苏联人民、科学家和工程技术人员，表示衷心的热烈的祝贺。
    苏联宇宙飞船发射和返回地球的成功，是苏联人民在科学事业上的又一重大贡献，也是人类在征服宇宙道路上的新的里程碑。苏联人民的这一新的创举说明，人类实现飞往行星际空间的愿望已经为期不远了。
    祝苏联人民在宇宙飞行的伟大事业中获得新的更大的成就！
    致友谊的敬礼！

    新华社上海22日电　上海科学家们对苏联科学家创造的宇宙飞船顺利返回地球的巨大成就，纷纷表示热烈的祝贺。科学家们一致指出，这是人类征服宇宙的斗争中的又一次辉煌的胜利。
    中国科学院上海分院副院长、生理研究所所长冯德培说，今年5月苏联成功地把第一个巨型宇宙飞船送上天，当时大家都兴奋地预期不久之后苏联就会发射载有动物且能安返地面的飞船，现在只隔了短短三个多月，这个期望就实现了。冯德培说，这第二个飞船的发射成功，有极其重要的科学意义，单就生物学方面来说，在三百二十公里的高空和完全失重的情况之下，对狗这样的高等动物进行细致的生理学观察达一昼夜之久，而且在返回地面之后，又可对它们作长期的追踪观察，这将为生物学写下全新的一章，并为人飞入宇宙提供必要的科学资料。
    生理学家张香桐说，苏联这次把两只狗用卫星式宇宙飞船送入太空，然后准确地安全地降落到预定地区，是科学史上空前的伟大成就。这证明苏联科学家们在无比优越的社会主义制度下，已成功地创造出使高级动物在宇宙空间内生活所必需的一切条件，解决了动物飞离和重返地球所必然遇到的生理学上的一切困难问题，为实现人类宇宙飞行作了准备。
    中国科学院生物化学研究所所长王应睐说，苏联的宇宙飞船成功地发射并在预定地区返回地球，再次表示了苏联科学技术的高度水平，特别是在动物身上进行的生物学和医学的复杂探测工作，已为宇宙生物学和医学累积了宝贵资料。
    冶金学家、交通大学冶金系主任周志宏说，这次苏联的宇宙飞船听从命令，安全返回到预定着陆点约十公里内，这说明苏联的遥远控制准确程度达到惊人的水平，特别是飞船能够通过地球大气层，没有被烧毁，这说明苏联对耐热合金、防热方面的研究有独特的创造，这是苏联冶金学家作出的重大贡献。
    中国科学院有机化学研究所副所长汪猷说，苏联将净重四千六百公斤的飞船送上轨道，并能自由控制飞船的运行，和解决它返回地球的措施，这是惊人的创举，这里包括了遥控与电视传播系统的设计装置，耐高温、耐低温和耐磨的金属及有机的结构和润滑材料的制造等一系列问题的解决，这些成功充分显示了苏联科学家在数学、物理、化学、工程等有关方面的杰出的成就。
