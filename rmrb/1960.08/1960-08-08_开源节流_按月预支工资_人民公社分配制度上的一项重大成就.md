    Open Source and Reduce Expenditure, Monthly Advance Wages
    --A Major Achievement in the People's Commune Distribution System By Wang Shixin, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Shangrao Prefectural Committee
    This year, more than 90% of the production brigades (basic accounting units) in the Shangrao area have implemented or are implementing a monthly wage advance system. Monthly advance is a major change in the distribution method of the people's communes. This reform marks a further improvement in the management level of the people's communes. The supply system solved the problem of food for the commune members, and the monthly advance further solved the problem of pocket money for the commune members. This practice is a good start for farmers to move from annual wages to monthly wages.
          Positive Effects of Monthly Wage Advances
    Judging from the situation in the Shangrao area, although the implementation of monthly advances has not been long, and the experience is still insufficient, its tremendous role has been demonstrated in many aspects.
    Implementing monthly advances can directly promote the great development of production from the distribution system. The process of monthly advance is actually a process of regular inspection of production results. The amount of advance not only reflects the quality of production, but also directly affects the personal interests of the commune members. In this way, the personal interests of the commune members and the collective interests are naturally and frequently linked together, prompting the commune members to be more concerned about collective production and do a good job in collective production. The commune members of Zhanxu Brigade, Zhanxu Commune, Dongxiang County, said it well: In the past (referring to before the monthly advance), there was no pre-distribution until the wheat harvest, and no bottom line until the end of the year; now there is a bottom line in mind, and wages can be received every month. In this way, the enthusiasm of the commune members for production has been unprecedentedly high.
    Implementing monthly advances can achieve planned organization of income and planned arrangement of commune member consumption. Under the constraints of monthly advances, cadres at all levels are urged to grasp grain with one hand and money with the other, grasp grain well and money well, and better implement the policy of walking on two legs. In Wuyuan, Boyang and other counties, five hundred and fifty-six brigades have already implemented monthly advances. In order to solve the financial difficulties in the advances and balance income and consumption, while vigorously grasping agricultural production, some labor forces were drawn to organize professional teams to vigorously develop diversified operations. In April and May alone, they received more than 3.04 million yuan in cash, an increase of about 80% compared with the same period last year. Wherever monthly advances are implemented, the unified relationship between distribution, accumulation, consumption, wages and supplies, final accounts and advances has been correctly handled at the beginning of the year, so that production and distribution, accumulation and consumption are all handled according to plan, which more effectively strengthens the planning of distribution work. Under the guidance of collective planning, the income and expenditure arrangements of individual commune members are also planned.
    Implementing monthly advances can better implement the policy of distribution according to work. In the past, the problem with the irregular advance system was that commune members spent and saved money randomly, resulting in long-term advances and short-term debts, which were unclear every year, affecting the implementation of the policy of distribution according to work. After the monthly advance, this problem was fundamentally solved. Distribution is checked every month, and policies are fulfilled every month. As the commune members said, "Monthly advance is fair and reasonable, more work, more pay, no deception for the old and young, timely payment, and no disputes."
    Implementing monthly advances can also make the commune's distribution work and management work twist into one rope. In the monthly advance in various places, we adhere to the "three guarantees" as the basis, combined with the evaluation of labor attitude, the evaluation of basic labor quotas, and the evaluation of "three guarantees" rewards and punishments. In this way, the production responsibility system and labor management have been effectively strengthened. Small team cadres consciously strengthen the leadership of the work team and establish a production responsibility system in order to strive for overproduction rewards; commune members actively attend work in order to achieve the basic labor quota and strive for more work and more pay. Huaming Brigade, Xiejiatan Commune, Boyang, originally had eleven out of twelve small teams that did not record work points or only recorded absenteeism. After the monthly advance, the commune members not only evaluated work and recorded points seriously, but also spontaneously engaged in labor quotas. This year, the efficiency of rice transplanting has increased by more than two times. At the same time, the monthly advance also urged the commune and team cadres to strengthen economic accounting and pay attention to economic results, as the cadres of Dongtian Brigade, Dongtian Commune, Wuyuan County said: "In the past, we calculated after using it, but now we calculate before using it, and we can't be careless."
    Implementing monthly advances can better combine the wage system and the supply system, solve the problem of food for the commune members in an all-round way, and correspondingly solve the problem of money for the masses, which is conducive to the consolidation and development of this distribution system. Moreover, through monthly advances, production has been rapidly developed, and the wage part has been increased; and the growth of production will inevitably promote the increase of the supply part. This also promotes the continuous development of the distribution system combining the supply system and the wage system.
    Implementing monthly advances can organically combine political work with certain material rewards, and continuously improve the communist awareness and collectivist thought of the commune members, so that the broad masses will turn participating in labor and doing a good job in production into their own conscious actions, and consolidate the labor system. Jin Dun Brigade, Huangxi Commune, Yujiang County, through the combination of evaluating work enthusiasm and monthly advances, a labor competition upsurge of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced has been vigorously launched in the whole team. The commune members who were rated as advanced reached 70%, and the labor attendance rate reached 100%.
          The Inevitable Result of the Development of the People's Commune
    The widespread implementation of the monthly advance system is the inevitable result of the development of the objective situation. As early as the later period of the advanced cooperative movement, the Shangrao area began to brew monthly wage advances. After the people's communes, the monthly advance has been further developed. Some forestry, fishery and vegetable brigades with relatively sufficient cash income have successively established a monthly advance system, and they have also continuously enriched the content of the monthly advance in the process of practice, showing the great role of the monthly advance; this not only improved the management level of cadres, but also stimulated the production enthusiasm of the masses, and the broad masses enthusiastically demanded the implementation of the monthly advance system. The people's communes implement a distribution system combining the supply system and the wage system. The problem of food for the commune members has been solved, and the habit of using money has begun to shift from seasonal to regular. They are increasingly eager to solve the problem of pocket money. However, with the increasing scope of collective management, the situation of relying on commune members to solve their own pocket money in the past has also changed. In this case, monthly wage advances have become very necessary. The rapid development of production in the people's communes has created conditions for the implementation of monthly advances: first, due to the large-scale construction of farmland capital construction, a relatively stable situation has emerged in production; second, due to the continuous expansion of the scope of commune management, the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline and fishery production, and the simultaneous growth of self-sufficient production and commodity production, this has greatly changed the situation of production income caused by single management, and production income has shifted from unbalanced to balanced. All of these fully prove that the current stage of the people's communes implementing monthly advances is not only necessary, but also completely possible.
          Actively Create Conditions for Monthly Pre-Distribution
    After we recognized this objective situation in practice, the prefectural party committee, according to the central government's instructions on distribution issues, promptly implemented monthly advances on a trial basis in production brigades with conditions; in production brigades with poor production conditions, bi-monthly advances were implemented; at the same time, the prefectural party committee also required those with very poor conditions who could not implement monthly advances temporarily to actively create conditions for the transition to monthly advances. This instruction was warmly welcomed by the broad masses. Party committees at all levels have also strengthened the leadership of this work in the spirit of grasping production with one hand and distribution with the other. As a result, monthly advances quickly became popular throughout the region. Of course, ideological obstacles were also encountered in the process of implementing monthly advances, that is, "the only condition theory." At the beginning, some people believed that monthly advances can only be implemented in mountainous areas, lakeside areas, suburban vegetable brigades and some economic crop areas where production is stable, the living standard is high, and the cash income is high, and it is not suitable for other areas. We promptly criticized this "the only condition theory" thought. We do not deny that the implementation of monthly advances requires certain conditions, but as a Marxist, we should not passively wait for the conditions to mature by themselves, but should actively create conditions. The fact is also true. As long as we fully rely on the superiority of the people's communes, while doing a good job in grain production, we will vigorously develop diversified operations and actively organize cash income, and it is entirely possible to realize monthly advances. In order to explore experience, the Dongxiang County Party Committee conducted a pilot project of monthly advances in Zhanxu Brigade, Zhanxu Commune. Zhanxu Brigade is a poor team with very low production and living standards. To implement monthly advances in such a place, one cannot help but arouse people's doubts, and even some commune party committee members believe that it is impossible for Zhanxu Brigade to implement monthly advances. For this reason, the Dongxiang County Party Committee organized a work team to go deep down, consult with grassroots cadres and the masses, and the masses warmly supported and contributed ideas: intercropping vegetables between cotton rows and squeezing out labor to engage in diversified operations. In this way, not only was the cash problem of pre-issuing wages completely solved, but the annual income plan of 88,000 yuan was expanded to 114,000 yuan, and the income of the whole team increased by 30%.
    The fear of trouble also hindered the implementation of monthly advances. Some people said: "After monthly advances, we have to grasp grain and money, which adds a lot of trouble." Therefore, they are unwilling to actively promote monthly advances. This is because these comrades did not realize that although the implementation of monthly advances will add some trouble to the work, it not only does not increase the trouble compared with temporary advances, but reduces a lot of trouble.
          Several Basic Links That Should Be Paid Attention To
    To do a good job in monthly advances, we must grasp the following basic links:
    Monthly advances should be combined with grasping production and organizing income to achieve planned organization of income and planned distribution. Production is the basis of distribution. The more production develops, the more income increases, and the better distribution can be done. Therefore, we must have positive and reliable production income to lay the material foundation for monthly advances. In this way, we must not only increase self-sufficient production, but also increase commodity production, expand cash income, so that production income and distribution expenditure are linked in time. To do this, we must pay close attention to strengthening the planning of production. We must have both annual and comprehensive plans for output and output value, as well as specific arrangements for each month and item, and we must regularly check the plans and make up for loopholes in time to ensure the realization of the plans and ensure the implementation of income.
    Monthly advances should be combined with political work. During the advance, we should conduct inspections and summarize production, combined with the evaluation of revolutionary enthusiasm; after the advance, we should carry out learning, surpassing, and helping competitions, so that the process of monthly advances becomes a process of mass self-education and self-improvement, and overcome purely economic viewpoints.
    Monthly advances must be based on the "three guarantees." The brigade pre-issues work points for contracted work to the contracting unit, and the contracting unit pre-issues wages to the commune members according to the actual work done, conscientiously implementing the principle of distribution according to work; regularly (once every quarter), combined with the monthly advance, evaluate the "three guarantees" rewards and punishments. When awarding and punishing, appropriate care should be given to units that promote advanced technology and conduct technical reform experiments; combined with the monthly advance, evaluate the basic labor quota and implement the system of "fixed work for food, and paying money for absenteeism"; reasonably evaluate the wage remuneration of different types of work according to the intensity of labor and the level of technology, conscientiously implement the policy of equal pay for equal work for men and women, and implement separate calculation and separate payment of women's wages (if they agree, they can also be paid uniformly by the whole family). In short, we must stimulate the enthusiasm of commune members for labor and production and promote production through the implementation of labor policies, so that the monthly advance becomes a driving force for production.
                  *　* 　* 　* 　*
    The new situation and new tasks require us to especially strengthen the leadership of monthly advance work. To lead this work, we must implement the secretary's leadership and special personnel management, grasping production with one hand and distribution with the other, so as to grasp it all year round, every month, and focus on it. To grasp it all year round means to grasp the planned income and implement the distribution work throughout the year; to grasp it every month means to organize cash income and do a good job in advance work every month; to focus on it means to concentrate our efforts to grasp it carefully and well during the four periods of spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

    开源节流　按月预支工资
    ——人民公社分配制度上的一项重大成就	中共上饶地委副书记　王世新
    今年上半年上饶地区有90％以上的生产大队（基本核算单位）已经或正在实行按月预支工资制度。按月预支，是人民公社分配方法上的一项重大变革。这项改革标志着人民公社的管理水平有了进一步的提高。供给制解决了社员的吃饭问题，按月预支又进一步解决了社员的零用钱问题。这种做法，是农民由年度工资走向按月发工资的良好开端。
          按月预支工资的积极效果
    从上饶地区的情况来看，虽然推行按月预支的时间还不长，经验还不足，但是它的巨大作用已经在许多方面显示出来了。
    实行按月预支，可以直接从分配制度上促进生产的大发展。按月预支的过程，实际上也是经常检查生产成果的过程，预支多少不仅反映了生产好坏，同时也直接关系到社员的切身利益，这样就很自然地把社员个人利益和集体利益经常地联成一体，促使社员更加关心集体生产，搞好集体生产。东乡县占圩公社占圩大队的社员说得好：过去（指按月预支前）不到麦收不预分，不到年终不摸底；现在心中有了底，每月都能领到工资了。这样，社员们的生产积极性空前高涨。
    实行按月预支，可以做到有计划地组织收入，有计划地安排社员消费。在按月预支的约束下，促使各级干部一手抓粮一手抓钱，抓好粮又抓好钱，更好地贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针。婺源、波阳等县已经推行按月预支的五百五十六个大队，为了解决预支中的资金困难，平衡收入和消费，在狠抓农业生产的同时，抽出部分劳动力组织专业队，大抓多种经营，仅四、五两个月即收入现金三百零四万多元，比去年同期增长80％左右。凡是推行按月预支的地方，在年初都正确地处理了分配、积累、消费，工资与供给，决算与预支的统一关系，使生产和分配、积累和消费都按计划办事，这就更有效地加强了分配工作的计划性。在集体计划的指导下，社员个人的收支安排也有了计划。
    实行按月预支，可以更好地贯彻按劳分配政策。过去不定期的预支制度，突出的问题是社员乱支乱储，长支短欠，年年纠缠不清，影响按劳分配政策的贯彻执行。按月预支以后，就从根本上解决了这个问题。分配月月检查，政策月月兑现。正如社员所说的那样：“按月预支，公平合理，多劳多得，老少无欺，及时兑现，不会扯皮”。
    实行按月预支，也可以使公社的分配工作和经营管理工作拧成一股绳。各地在按月预支中，坚持以“三包”为基础，结合评劳动态度，评基本劳动定额，评“三包”奖惩。这样，就有效地加强了生产责任制和劳动管理。小队干部为了争取超产奖励，自觉地加强作业组的领导，建立生产责任制度；社员为了实现基本劳动定额，争取多劳多得而积极出勤。波阳谢家滩公社化民大队，原来全大队十二个小队中，有十一个不记工分或只记缺勤。按月预支以后，社员不但评工记分认真了，而且还自发地搞起了劳动定额，今年插秧工效提高两倍多。同时，按月预支也促使社、队干部加强经济核算，讲究经济效果，正如婺源县东田公社东田大队干部所说：“过去是用了再算，现在是算了再用，一点也不能马虎”。
    实行按月预支，可以更好地把工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度结合起来，可以在全面解决社员吃饭问题的同时，相应地解决群众用钱问题，有利于这种分配制度的巩固和发展。而且通过按月预支，迅速地发展了生产，提高了工资部分；而生产的增长，又必然促使供给部分的增加。这也就促进了供给制和工资制相结合的分配制度不断向前发展。
    实行按月预支，可以使政治工作和一定的物质奖励有机地结合起来，不断地提高社员的共产主义觉悟和集体主义思想，使广大群众把参加劳动、搞好生产变为自己的自觉行动，巩固劳动制度。余江县璜溪公社金墩大队，通过评干劲和按月预支相结合的办法，一个学先进、赶先进、超先进的劳动竞赛热潮，在全队范围内轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。社员被评为先进者达到70％，劳动出勤率达到了100％。
          人民公社发展的必然结果
    按月预支制度的普遍推行，是客观形势发展的必然结果。早在高级合作化运动的后期，上饶地区就开始酝酿按月预支工资。人民公社化后，按月预支就有了进一步的发展，一些现金收入比较充裕的林业、渔业和蔬菜大队都先后建立了按月预支制度，并且也都在实践过程中，不断地丰富了按月预支的内容，显示出按月预支的巨大作用；这既提高了干部管理水平，又激发了群众生产积极性，广大群众热烈要求推行按月预支制度。人民公社实行供给制与工资制相结合的分配制度，社员的吃饭问题解决了，用钱习惯开始由季节性转向经常化，他们越来越迫切要求解决零用钱问题。但是，在集体经营范围日益扩大的情况下，过去依靠社员自己解决零用钱的局面，又随着发生了变化，在这种情况下，按月预支工资，就成为十分必要了。人民公社生产的迅速发展，为推行按月预支创造了条件：首先是由于农田基本建设的大规模进行，在生产上已经出现了比较稳定的局面；其次是由于公社经营范围的不断扩大，农、林、牧、副、渔业生产全面发展，自给性生产和商品性生产同时增长，这就在很大程度上改变了由单一经营而造成生产收入的状况，生产收入由不平衡走向平衡。所有这些，都充分证明了，现阶段人民公社推行按月预支，不仅需要，而且也完全可能。
          积极创造按月预分的条件
    我们在实践中认识了这一客观形势以后，地委即根据中央关于分配问题的指示，及时在有条件的生产大队试行按月预支；在生产条件较差的生产大队，实行双月预支；同时地委还要求条件很差暂时不能实行按月预支的，也必须积极创造条件向按月预支过渡。这一指示受到了广大群众的热烈欢迎。各级党委也都本着一手抓生产，一手抓分配的精神，加强了对这一工作的领导。于是，按月预支便很快地在全区范围内普及开了。当然，在推行按月预支的过程中也遇到了思想障碍，这就是“唯条件论”。开始有人认为：按月预支只能在生产稳定、生活水平高、现金收入多的山区、滨湖地区、城郊蔬菜大队和一部分经济作物地区推行，而不适于其他地区。我们及时批判了这种“唯条件论”的思想。我们并不否认，实行按月预支需要具备一定的条件，但是，作为一个马克思主义者，不应当消极地等待条件自己成熟，而应当积极地创造条件。事实也正是这样，只要充分依靠人民公社的优越性，在搞好粮食生产的同时，大力开展多种经营，积极组织现金收入，实现按月预支是完全可能的。东乡县委为了摸索经验，在占圩公社占圩大队进行按月预支试点。占圩大队是个穷队，生产和生活水平都很低，要在这样的地方实行按月预支，不能不引起人们的怀疑，甚至一些公社党委委员也认为占圩大队实行按月预支是不可能的。东乡县委为此组织了工作组，深入下去，与基层干部和群众商量，群众热烈拥护，人人献计献策：实行棉花行间套种蔬菜，挤出劳动力搞多种经营。这样，不但完全解决了预发工资的现金问题，而且使全年八万八千元的收入计划，扩大到十一万四千元，全队收入提高了30％。
    怕麻烦的思想也曾阻碍了按月预支的推行，有些人说：“按月预支以后，要抓粮又要抓钱，增加了很多麻烦。”因此，不愿积极推行按月预支。这是由于这些同志没有认识到：实行按月预支，虽然会给工作上增加一些麻烦，但比起临时借支不仅没有增加麻烦，反而减少了很多的麻烦。
          应该注意的几个基本环节
    搞好按月预支，必须抓住以下的几个基本环节：
    按月预支要同抓生产，组织收入结合起来，做到有计划地组织收入，有计划地进行分配。生产是分配的基础，生产越发展，收入越增加，分配就越能搞好。因此，一定要有积极稳靠的生产收入来奠定按月预支的物质基础。这样，就不仅要增加自给性的生产，还要增加商品性的生产，扩大现金收入，从而使生产收入和分配支出在时间上衔接起来。要做到这些，就要十分注意加强生产的计划性，既要有全年全面的产量、产值计划，又要有分月分项的具体安排，并且要经常检查计划，发现漏洞及时补上，保证计划实现，保证收入落实。
    按月预支，要同政治工作结合起来。预支中进行检查总结生产，结合评比革命干劲；预支后开展学、超、帮竞赛，使按月预支的过程，变成群众自我教育、自我提高的过程，克服单纯的经济观点。
    按月预支必须以“三包”为基础。大队按包工工分预支到承包单位，承包单位按实做工资预支到社员，认真贯彻按劳分配原则；定期（每季一次）结合按月预支评比“三包”奖惩，奖惩时对于推广先进技术和进行技术改革试验的单位，要予以适当照顾；结合按月预支，评比基本劳动定额，执行“定工吃饭，旷工交钱”的制度；根据劳动强度大小和技术高低等情况，合理评定不同工种的工资报酬，认真贯彻男女同工同酬政策，实行妇女工资单独计算、单独支付（如果本人同意，也可以全家统一支付）。总之必须通过贯彻执行劳动政策，使按月预支成为激发社员劳动生产积极性，推动生产的动力。
                  *　* 　* 　* 　*
    新的形势，新的任务，需要我们特别加强按月预支工作的领导。领导这项工作必须实行书记挂帅，专人管理，一手抓生产、一手抓分配，做到常年抓、月月抓、重点抓。常年抓就是要抓计划收入，把分配工作贯彻全年；月月抓就是要组织现金收入，按月作好预支工作；重点抓就是春、夏、秋、冬四个时期集中力量抓一下，做到抓细抓好。
