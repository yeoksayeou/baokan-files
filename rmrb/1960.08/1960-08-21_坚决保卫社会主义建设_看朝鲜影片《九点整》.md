    Resolutely Defend Socialist Construction
    ——On the North Korean Film "Nine O'Clock Sharp"
    Zhang He
    The film "Nine O'Clock Sharp" immediately immerses the audience in the energetic and joyous atmosphere of the "Chollima" nation. In a tractor factory in northern Korea, workers are actively laboring to fulfill the task of producing 3,500 tractors this year.
    However, American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique are unwilling to allow the people of North Korea to live peaceful and happy lives. They send spies to infiltrate the north and carry out sabotage activities. The tractor factory is one of their targets for destruction. Counter-revolutionary elements like "Guan Shou" take advantage of the fact that the factory foreman, Gen San, had the stain of participating in the enemy's "security forces," forcing Gen San to join them in sabotaging the testing and production of tractors. Gen San wants to break free, but he is afraid of exposing his historical problems and lacks the courage to confess to the organization. This individualism puts Gen San in a state of conflict, distress, and great danger, causing losses in the test run of the tractor engine. At this time, the enemy takes advantage of his hesitation and further threatens Gen San with a pistol to bury a time bomb, preparing to blow up the factory at nine o'clock sharp on the day the first tractor rolls off the assembly line. The special agent threatens him, saying, "If you betray us, your life, your livelihood, everything you have, will be over!"
    Under the coercion of the enemy, Gen San slowly walks towards the factory. He is struggling fiercely inside. In the old society, he suffered all kinds of torment from the enemy. His wife was killed by American imperialism. In the "security forces," "Guan Shou" used a pistol to force him to arrest his own uncle. The terrifying scene of him secretly escaping from the clutches of the enemy is still vivid in his mind. Today, the motherland is advancing by leaps and bounds, and he and his younger sister, En Shu, both have jobs, using their rich technical experience to serve the people. He actively helps the advanced producer, Park Dong-cheol, to carry out technological innovations, is loved by his fellow workers, and is trusted by the factory leadership. He has his own happy family, with an innocent, lively, and lovable little daughter. Whether at the factory or at home, Gen San lives in an atmosphere full of honor, friendship, and warmth. His life is already linked to the motherland's radiant future. But now, the special agents are asking him to abandon all of this, to become an enemy of the people, and to embark on the road to death. How can he jump into that abyss of sin again?
    At this moment, the loudspeakers in the square are broadcasting moving news: "Comrades, all staff and workers, under the leadership of the Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, we have successfully manufactured the first tractor of the motherland. Today, at nine o'clock sharp, the first tractor will be galloping across the vast fields. The huge sound of this tractor is the beating of our working class's own hearts, a manifestation of our love for the motherland..." This is the voice of the Party, the voice of the worker brothers filled with pride. This voice gives him encouragement and courage, rescuing him from the edge of a bottomless cliff. Gen San is moved by this loud voice. He thinks, "No, I work in the factory, and I have also built it. I would rather die than destroy the factory." At the same time, due to the enlightenment of the Party committee secretary and the influence of his younger sister, he eliminates his concerns and decides to expose the enemy.
    At the most critical moment, the public security organs, with the assistance of the working masses, arrest the American-Rhee special agents "Guan Shou" and Zhen Ji. However, the cunning enemy attempts to deny it. At this time, Gen San angrily points at the special agent and says, "It's him, it's this guy." "Guan Shou" can no longer deny it, and he has to bow his head and confess his guilt.
    At nine o'clock sharp, the first tractor drives out of the factory. People are cheering, and Gen San, En Shu, Dong-cheol, and others are also standing in the midst of the jubilant crowd. At this time, Gen San feels more deeply than ever before how happy it is to stand with the people!
    The film "Nine O'Clock Sharp" tells us that even in peaceful days, we should be a hundred times more vigilant against the enemy. The day imperialism does not die, it will not stop undermining our socialist construction, nor will it give up subverting our socialist countries. As the Party committee secretary of the tractor factory said, "The greater our construction achievements, the more the enemy will want to sabotage. Therefore, we must strengthen our vigilance at all times." At the same time, the path that Gen San has taken is of profound educational significance to those who have gone astray. Whoever stands completely with the people has a limitless and bright future; while those who betray the motherland and become enemies of the people, no matter how cunning they are, will eventually not escape the giant palms of the people.
    The heroic Korean people are guarding the 38th parallel, defending the eastern outpost of the socialist camp, and preventing the arrogant and shameless American imperialists from daring to cross the line, making a great contribution to peace in Asia and the world. With a high degree of vigilance, they have cracked down on all the enemy's conspiracies to undermine North Korea's socialist construction, and are speeding forward with the posture of a "Chollima."

    坚决保卫社会主义建设
    ——看朝鲜影片《九点整》
    张鹤
    影片《九点整》一开始就把观众带进“千里马”之国充满着干劲和欢乐的气氛中。在朝鲜北部的某拖拉机制造厂，工人们正在为完成今年生产三千五百台拖拉机的任务而积极地劳动着。
    可是美帝国主义和李承晚集团，不甘心让北朝鲜人民过着和平幸福的生活。他们派遣特务，潜入北部进行破坏活动。拖拉机厂就是他们的一个破坏目标。反革命分子“官寿”等利用这个厂的工长根三曾参加过敌人“治安队”的污点，逼迫根三同他们一起进行破坏拖拉机的试制和生产的活动。根三想要摆脱，但又害怕暴露自己的历史问题，没有勇气向组织检举和交代。这种个人主义思想使根三陷于矛盾苦闷和十分危险的境地，给拖拉机发动机的试车造成了损失。这时敌人又利用他的徬徨犹豫，进一步用手枪胁迫根三去埋定时炸弹，准备当天上午九点整第一台拖拉机出厂时炸掉工厂。特务恐吓他说：“如果你出卖我们，你的生命，你的生活，你的一切，就都要完蛋！”
    根三在敌人的挟持下慢慢地走向工厂。他内心在作激烈的斗争。在旧社会里，他受尽了敌人的折磨。他的妻子是被美帝国主义炸死的。在“治安队”，“官寿”用手枪威迫他去逮捕自己的叔父，他冒险从敌人的魔爪下偷偷溜走时的恐怖情景，还历历在眼前。今天祖国一日千里地突飞猛进，他和妹妹恩淑都有了工作，运用自己丰富的技术经验为人民服务。他积极帮助先进生产者朴东哲进行技术革新，受到工友们的爱戴，也得到工厂领导上的信任。他有了自己的幸福的家，有一个天真活泼、讨人喜欢的小女儿。无论在工厂还是在家里，根三都生活在一种充满着荣誉、友爱、温暖的气氛中。他的生活已经跟祖国光芒万丈的前途连结在一起。而现在，特务们却要求他抛弃这一切，与人民为敌，走向死亡的道路。他怎能再往那罪恶的深渊里跳呢？
    这时，广场上的扩音器正在播送着动人的消息：“全体职工同志们，我们在党和金日成首相的领导下，制造成功了祖国的第一台拖拉机。今天上午九点整，第一台拖拉机就要奔驰在辽阔的田野上。这台拖拉机的巨大的响声，也就是我们工人阶级自己心脏的跳动，是我们对祖国热爱的表现……。”这是党的声音，是工人弟兄们充满着自豪的声音。这声音给予他鼓舞和勇气，把他从万丈深潭的悬崖边救起来。根三为这宏亮的声音所激动，他想：“不成，我在厂里工作，也建设过它，我就是死也不能炸毁工厂。”同时，由于党委书记的启发和妹妹的影响，他消除了顾虑决定检举敌人。
    在最紧要的关头，公安机关在工人群众的协助下逮捕了美李特务分子“官寿”和贞姬。但是，狡猾的敌人却企图抵赖。这时，根三愤怒地指着特务分子说：“是他，是这个家伙。”“官寿”再也无法抵赖了，他不得不低头认罪。
    九点整，第一辆拖拉机从工厂里驶出来了。人们在欢呼，根三和恩淑、东哲等也站在狂欢的人群中间。这时，根三比过去任何时候都更深刻地感觉到，跟人民站在一起是多么幸福啊！
    影片《九点整》告诉我们：即使在和平的日子里，也应该百倍地警惕着敌人。帝国主义一天不死亡，它就一天不会停止破坏我们的社会主义建设，也一天不会放弃对我们社会主义国家进行颠覆活动。正如拖拉机厂的党委书记所说的：“我们建设的成就愈大，敌人就愈想破坏。因此，我们要时刻加强警惕。”同时，根三所走过的道路，对于那些曾经误入歧途的人们，特别具有深刻的教育意义。谁跟人民完全站在一起，谁就有着无限光明的前途；而那些背叛祖国与人民为敌的人，不管他们怎样狡猾，最后总是逃不出人民的巨掌。
    英雄的朝鲜人民坚守着三八线，保卫了社会主义阵营的东方前哨阵地，使蛮横无耻的美帝国主义者不敢越雷池一步，对亚洲和世界和平作出了伟大的贡献。他们以高度的警惕性，打击了敌人破坏北朝鲜进行社会主义建设的一切阴谋活动，正以“千里马”的姿态向前飞奔。
