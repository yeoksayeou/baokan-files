Duoneng High Platform

    Workers at the Houma Station of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, relying on their own efforts and using indigenous methods, built a multi-functional high platform. Coupled with loading and unloading machinery, it has achieved streamlined loading of various goods, reducing the average loading time by more than 50% and saving thirty loading and unloading workers.

    The Duoneng High Platform differs from ordinary high platforms in that its front edge is stepped, divided into upper and lower sections. The steps are 0.5 meters wide, facilitating movement and work for shunting and loading/unloading personnel. The upper section of the platform has a 1.8-meter-wide chute every thirteen meters, with a bottom slope of 40 degrees, allowing goods to slide into the car along the slope. It can load open wagons, flat wagons, and boxcars. At one end of the platform is a small platform 15 meters long and 1.1 meters high, equipped with a 5-ton wooden crane for loading and unloading heavy goods. When this type of high platform is integrated with various loading and unloading equipment, it allows packaged and bulk goods such as cotton, grain, coke, and oil drums, as well as livestock such as pigs and sheep, to roll in, rush up, and slide down.

    Using the Duoneng High Platform as the main body, and integrating it with loading and unloading machinery to achieve streamlined loading operations, is a new development in the station's vigorous technical innovation and revolution in loading and unloading. It is highly efficient and saves labor: In the past, it took twenty-four strong laborers two hundred minutes to load a car of coke, but now ten women can complete the loading in thirty minutes.

    多能高站台
    太原铁路局侯马车站职工土法上马，自力更生地建成了一座多能高站台，并与装卸机具配搭成套，实现了多种货物的装车滑溜化，使货物的装车时间平均缩短百分之五十以上，节省装卸工人三十名。
    多能高站台与一般的高站台不同，站台的前沿是阶梯式的，分为上下两段，台阶宽○·五米，便利调车、装卸人员通行和作业；站台的上段每隔十三米有一个宽一·八米、底斜坡四十度的滑溜口，使货物能沿着斜坡滑进车内，既能装敞车、平车，又能装棚车。站台的一端附有长十五米、高一·一米的小站台，上设五吨木吊一座，用以装卸笨重货物。这种高站台与各种装卸设备配成套后，可以使装棉、粮、焦炭、油桶等包装和散装货物以及猪羊等牲畜，一滚而进，一轰而上，一滑而下。
    以多能高站台为主体，与装卸机具配套成龙，实现装车滑溜作业，是车站大搞装卸技术革新、技术革命的新发展。它效率高，省劳力：过去二十四个强劳力装一车焦炭要用二百分钟，现在十个妇女用三十分钟就可装完。（据新华社讯）
