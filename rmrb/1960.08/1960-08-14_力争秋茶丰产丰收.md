Strive for a Bumper Harvest of Autumn Tea
    By the People's Daily Commentator

Tea production is divided into three seasons: spring, summer, and autumn. Currently, it is the autumn tea production season. The autumn tea production season is long and accounts for a large proportion of the total annual yield. Striving for a significant increase in autumn tea production is crucial for ensuring a full tea harvest for the year. Based on the experience of spring and summer tea production, all regions should build on their successes and continue to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn tea.

Based on the experience of spring and summer tea production, the first step in achieving a bumper harvest of autumn tea is to ensure that the tea trees grow well, sprout abundantly, and produce strong buds. This requires us to work diligently on autumn tea garden cultivation and management. Given the high temperatures in autumn and the frequent occurrence of drought in some tea areas, autumn tea garden management should focus on drought prevention, vigorously promoting water conservation and drought prevention measures such as mulching tea gardens with grass and irrigating. Mulching tea gardens with grass is easy to do, and the decomposed weeds are also excellent organic fertilizers that can increase soil nutrients, improve soil structure, and enhance fertility. According to research and analysis by the Fujian Province Fu'an Tea Research Institute on mulching tea gardens with grass, whether mulching is done during dry periods or year-round, and whether cogon grass or green manure is used for covering, there is a significant effect on increasing production. Mulching tea gardens can increase yields by 12% to 19% compared to those without mulching. The increase in drought seasons is even more significant, with an increase of 47% to 62%. There is also a noticeable increase in the weight and length of buds and leaves. Mulching tea gardens not only maintains a high level of moisture in the topsoil but also regulates soil temperature. Therefore, mulching tea gardens is a very effective measure for increasing autumn tea production and is easy to implement, so it should be vigorously promoted. At the same time, we should also combine fertilization and weeding of tea gardens with vigorous promotion of foliar fertilization to ensure that the tea gardens are well-fertilized and adequately watered.

Attaching importance to autumn tea production and tapping the potential for increasing autumn tea production is a very important measure for achieving a full tea harvest for the year. In recent years, all regions have made great achievements in increasing autumn tea production. Last year, the proportion of autumn tea output in many key tea areas accounted for more than 40% of the total annual output. However, the proportion of autumn tea in some tea areas is still very small, and there is still great potential to be tapped. According to the experience of various regions in the past two years, in order to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn tea, it is necessary to conscientiously implement reasonable picking and resolutely prevent the picking of old leaves. We must be bold in picking, but also reasonable in picking. After a large harvest of autumn tea, we must also promptly carry out winter fertilization and frost prevention to create conditions for the safe overwintering of tea trees and a bumper harvest in the coming year.

Making reasonable arrangements for labor is the key to striving for a bumper harvest of autumn tea. Tea garden management, tea picking, and tea making all require manpower. With the necessary labor force, it is possible to carry out tea garden management in a timely manner and ensure that tea leaves are picked and processed in a timely manner. In this sense, "with labor, there is tea." All tea areas must take care of the labor force required for autumn tea production during the "double rush" period. According to the experience of many major tea areas during the spring and summer tea seasons, the best approach is to combine fixed professional organizations with large-scale mass movements. On the one hand, arrange a certain amount of labor to be responsible for daily management and picking and processing; on the other hand, during the peak production season, mobilize forces to concentrate on picking and processing. This will not only ensure that regular production is carried out effectively but also prevent the slackening of peak-season production. In addition, it is necessary to further strengthen political and ideological work, mobilize the masses to carry out high-efficiency picking and processing campaigns and appraisal competitions, and also pay attention to reasonably adjusting labor quotas and work point compensation standards for tea picking and tea making based on the characteristics of autumn tea production.

Now is the beginning of autumn tea production. Leading cadres at all levels in tea areas should go deep into the front line of production, participate in production, lead production, and help communes and production teams solve specific problems in tea picking and tea making, and strive for a bumper harvest of autumn tea.

    力争秋茶丰产丰收
    本报评论员
    茶叶生产分为春、夏、秋三个季节，目前正是秋茶生产季节。秋茶生产季节长，比重大，努力争取秋茶大量增产，对于保证实现全年茶叶丰收，具有决定意义。各地应在总结春、夏茶生产经验的基础上，乘胜前进，继续夺取秋茶的丰收。
    根据春、夏茶生产经验，要实现秋茶的丰产丰收，首先要使茶树能够生长得好，发芽多，发芽壮。这就要求我们必须努力作好秋季的茶园培育管理工作。根据秋季气温高，一些茶区常常出现干旱的情况，秋季的茶园管理应该以防旱为中心，大力推广茶园铺草、灌水等保水防旱的措施。茶园铺草取材容易，杂草腐烂后又是很好的有机肥料，可以增加土壤养分，改善土壤结构，提高肥力。据福建省福安茶叶研究所对茶园铺草的研究分析，不论是旱期铺草，或长年铺草，不论是用茅草或用绿肥作复盖，都有明显的增产作用。铺草的茶园比不铺草的产量可增加12％—19％，特别是在干旱季节增产效果更显著，增产幅度高达47％—62％。芽叶的重量和长度也有明显的增加。铺草的茶园既能经常保持茶园表土有较高的湿度，又能调节土壤的温度。因此，茶园铺草是增产秋茶的一项十分有效的措施，也是容易做到的，应该大力推广。同时，还应结合进行茶园的施肥、中耕除草大力推广根外喷肥，使茶园肥饱水足。
    重视秋茶生产，大挖秋茶的增产潜力，是夺取全年茶叶丰收的一个十分重要的措施。这几年各地大抓秋茶增产取得了很大的成绩，去年不少重点茶区的秋茶产量比重已经占全年产量的40％以上。但有些茶区秋茶的比重还很小，秋茶还大有潜力可挖。根据近两年各地的经验，争取秋茶增产丰收，必须切实贯彻合理采摘，坚决防止采光老叶。要做到既要大胆地采，又要合理地采。大采秋茶以后，还要及时进行冬季施肥和防冻等工作，为茶树安全越冬和来年丰产创造条件。
    做好劳动力的合理安排，是争取秋茶丰收的关键。茶园管理、茶叶的采摘和制造，都是要人来做的，有了必要的劳动力，才能够及时进行茶园管理，保证茶叶及时采摘和制造。从这个意义上来说，“有劳动力就有茶叶”。各茶区在“双抢”期间一定要照顾秋茶生产所需的劳动力。根据许多主要茶区春夏茶期间的经验，最好的办法是采取固定专业组织和大搞群众运动相结合，一方面安排一定数量的劳动力，负责平时的管理和采制；另一方面在生产的旺季，则调集力量突击采制。这样既能保证搞好经常性的生产，又不放松旺季的生产。此外，要进一步加强政治思想工作，发动群众开展采、制高工效运动和评比竞赛，还要注意根据秋茶生产的特点，合理调整采茶、制茶的劳动定额、工分报酬标准。
    现在正是秋茶生产的开始，茶区的各级领导干部应深入生产的第一线，参加生产，领导生产，帮助公社和生产队解决采茶、制茶中的具体问题，力争秋茶丰产丰收。
