Drawing Strength from the Masses
Ji Guochao, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party He'erchuan People's Commune Committee, Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, Qinghai

The wheat is almost ready for harvest. Before the harvest, we have many things to do. These tasks are not only urgent but also very important, and closely related to a bumper harvest.

As cadres leading agricultural production, what should we do? The most effective way is to go to the forefront of production, go among the masses, eat, live, work, and discuss with them, relying on the masses to comprehensively manage the late-stage field management and all the preparatory work before the harvest...

July 7th, Thursday

After a heavy rain, I carried my backpack, rolled up my trouser legs, and walked more than ten *li* of muddy road to the Ma Family Production Team. After the rain, the sun came out, and the commune members were distributed in a large bay, cutting green grass to make green manure with great enthusiasm. The slopes were full of people. Seeing this scene, one cannot help but feel that the Great Leap Forward has made the commune members' enthusiasm even greater. The crops this year have not yet been harvested, and they are taking the time to accumulate fertilizer for next year's crops. This is truly a cycle! Just imagine, where would such great strength come from in individual farming, mutual aid groups, or cooperatives?

On the road, I met the Party Branch Secretary, Ma Zhanyue, and the Production Team Leader, Zhang Jiwu. I asked them: How was the heavy rain just now? Did it hail? They excitedly told me, "Today, our cannons did a beautiful job in the clouds, turning the red clouds into drizzle. If it had hailed, the crops would have been greatly damaged; now that the hail has turned into drizzle, the crops have greatly benefited." Everyone laughed together. This is the happiness and joy brought about by the strong confidence of "man can conquer nature" and the pragmatic spirit of the commune members.

July 8th, Friday

Last night, the Provincial Propaganda Minister and the First Secretary of the County Party Committee came to the production team and gave many specific instructions on current production and living arrangements. In order to immediately turn these instructions into action, early in the morning, I, along with the Party Branch Secretary Ma Zhanyue and the Team Leader Zhao De, led more than sixty commune members to the potato fields to hill the soil and apply fertilizer.

At noon, we spread a layer of wood ash on the vegetable field. During the labor, we found that this vegetable field was dense in some places and sparse in others, and there were many blank spaces on the edges and corners of the fields and next to the ridges. So we immediately found several experienced old farmers to study it at the head of the field. Everyone chipped in, one word at a time, and came up with remedial measures such as replanting, transplanting seedlings, and applying fertilizer. In the afternoon, all the remedial work was completed. Zhao, the old man in charge of planting vegetables, said, "Today's meeting at the head of the field was a good one. We increased the planting area by more than four *mu* in the blank spaces. Now the land is being used effectively, otherwise, it would have been sparse in some places and dense in others, and the vegetables would certainly not have grown well."

From this small matter, I deeply realized that: cadres going deep into the forefront must not only bury themselves in labor, but also must see more, think more, and discover problems in a timely manner, relying on the masses to solve problems. If we only bury ourselves in labor, then we cannot fully reflect the great significance of cadres going deep into the forefront, but only add a labor force to the production team, which is very insufficient. Every cadre who goes deep into the forefront must not only be a good fighter but also a good commander, improving leadership skills and solving practical problems through labor.

July 9th, Saturday

I got up in the morning and took the time to take a stroll around the cafeteria, the home for the elderly, and the kindergarten of the Ma Family Team. The living arrangements of this team are very good, and the commune members are also very enthusiastic. The elderly in the home for the elderly, seeing that the wheat is about to be harvested, are also busy helping everyone with some odd jobs. The old people led me to visit many things they had proactively found materials to make for the wheat harvest, including buckets, pot lids, bellows, coal buckets, neckbands for the animals pulling carts, and sacks, ropes, etc., which were piled up in a big pile. The vegetables planted by the old people are growing very vigorously, and the pig they raised is also growing fat and big. The old people have made great achievements. I kept praising their enthusiasm and at the same time advised them to pay more attention to their health and rest more. The old people hurriedly explained, "We have rested enough. We can't stay idle. Seeing that the harvest is coming soon, if we do some preparations, we can reduce some work for the young people!"

In the conversation, I learned that this team takes good care of the elderly in the home for the elderly. However, the old people still have an opinion. An old man said to me, "The cadres only know how to take care of us. It would be best if they could tell us more about the national and world situation." It seems that this is an urgent request from the old people, which deserves our close attention. After discussing with Tao Yizhang, the Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch, we decided to appoint a propagandist to regularly read newspapers and explain policies to the old people.

Seeing the initiative and soaring enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members, my confidence is particularly strong. As long as we fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all commune members, any task will surely be completed.

    从群众中吸取力量
    中共青海互助土族自治县贺尔川公社委员会书记　吉国朝
    快要收割麦子了。在收割之前，我们还有许多事情要做。这些工作不但任务紧急，而且都很重要，都和丰产丰收有密切关系。
    作为领导农业生产的干部，该怎么办呢？最有效的办法就是到生产第一线去，到群众中去，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，依靠群众，全面搞好后期田间管理和收割前的一切准备工作……
    7月7日　星期四
    一场大雨过后，我背着背包，卷起裤腿，走了十几里泥泞路，来到马家生产队。雨过天晴，社员们正分布在一个大湾里割青草沤绿肥，劲头很大。坡上坡下布满了人。看到这种情景，不能不使人感觉到，大跃进使社员们的干劲越来越大了。今年的庄稼还没收，他们又抽空为明年的庄稼积造肥料了，这真是环环紧扣啊！试想，单干、互助组、合作社哪有这么大的力量呢？
    在路上，碰见了党支部书记马占玥和生产小队长张继武，我问他们：刚才的大雨怎样？没下雹子吧？他们兴致勃勃地告诉我：“今天我们的火炮在云头上打了个美，一下把红云给打成细雨了。如果下雹子，庄稼会大大地受害了；现在雹子变成了细雨，庄稼大大地受益了。”大家一起笑了。这就是“人定胜天”的坚强信心和社员们的实干精神所得来的幸福和欢乐。
    7月8日　星期五
    昨天晚上，省委宣传部长和县委第一书记到生产队来，对当前生产和生活安排等问题作了许多具体指示。为了把这些指示立即变成行动，一大早我就和党支部书记马占玥、队长赵德领着六十多名社员到洋芋地里壅土、追肥。
    中午在蔬菜地里撒了一层草木灰。在劳动中，我们发现这片菜地稠一处、稀一处，地边地角和塄坎旁边空白地很多，于是立即找来几位有经验的老农在地头研究了一下，大家你一言，我一语凑了一会，想出了补种、移苗、追肥等补救办法。午后，全部补救完毕。管种菜的赵老汉说：“今天这地头会开的好，增种空白地四亩多，这一下土地才使上劲了，不然稀的稀，稠的稠，菜蔬保险长不好。”
    从这件小事使我深深体会到：干部深入第一线，绝不能只是埋头劳动，还必须多看、多想，及时发现问题，依靠群众解决问题。如果只是埋头劳动，那就不能全面体现干部深入第一线的伟大意义，而只能给生产队增加个劳动力，这是很不够的。每一个深入第一线的干部既要当好战斗员，更要当好指挥员，通过劳动提高领导水平，解决实际问题。
    7月9日　星期六
    早上起来，抽空到马家队的食堂、敬老院、幼儿园转了一转。这个队的生活安排搞得很不错，社员干劲也高。敬老院的老人们看到快要收割麦子了，也忙着帮助大家做些零星活。老人们领着我参观了他们主动找材料做成的许多供给麦收用的东西，其中有水桶、锅盖、风匣、煤斗，拉车的牲口围脖，还有麻袋、绳索等，摆了一大堆。老人们种的菜长得很茁壮，养的一头猪也长得又肥又大。老人们的成绩很大，我不住地称赞了他们的干劲，同时也劝他们多注意身体，注意休息。老人们忙解释：“休息是休息够了，我们都闲不住呀，眼看就要收割了，我们做点准备，就给青年人减少点工作嘛！”
    在谈话中，我了解到这个队对敬老院的老人们照顾很周到，但是，老人们还有一个意见，一位老汉对我说：“干部们光知道照顾我们，最好能多给我们讲些全国的和世界的形势。”看来，这是老人们一个迫切要求，值得我们很好注意。经过和党支部副书记陶义章研究后，决定指定一个宣传员经常向老人们读报纸、讲政策。
    看到广大社员这种主动精神和冲天干劲，我的信心就格外足了。只要充分调动全体社员的积极性，什么任务都一定能够完成。
