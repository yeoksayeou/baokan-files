Life-and-Death Friendship Amidst Stormy Waves
A Story of Chinese and Korean People Working Together to Rescue Fishing Boats
Guo Xihou

On July 29th, two stories of risking lives to rescue fishing boats in stormy waves occurred simultaneously in the Yellow Sea. This is another song of Sino-Korean friendship.

On the evening of July 28th, a storm of magnitude nine or higher suddenly struck the sea between the Liaodong Peninsula and the West Korean Bay. Startling giant waves churned on the sea. Soldiers stationed at a lookout post on a certain island discovered a wooden boat through their binoculars. The bow of the boat was above water, while the rear half was submerged in the waves. The boat was being carried by the fierce southeast wind and giant waves, drifting from the high seas towards the island with the tide. It was evident that the boat had been damaged by the storm. Squad Leader Yan Fancai sent out several communication signals to the wooden boat, but received no response. At around 8:00 AM on the morning of the 29th, the boat was carried to a place about one thousand meters from the island. Yan Fancai sent out another communication signal and finally saw a person struggling to stand up from the water-filled cabin, raising the national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

"Look! It's a fishing boat from our fraternal neighbor. Prepare to rescue it, and never let it meet with misfortune," Deputy Platoon Leader Li Mingshan called out.

The boat was still being carried by the wind and waves towards the island, only four hundred meters away, and it was about to crash into the dangerous area full of reefs. At this critical moment, administrator Ren Zhengshui led more than twenty soldiers to meet it, and sent a signal to the approaching boat to drop anchor and stop moving forward. Several People's Liberation Army soldiers of Korean ethnicity shouted in Korean, "Drop anchor quickly, watch out for the reefs!" The boat dropped anchor, and the boat was tossed back and forth in the wind and waves, throwing the people on board around. At this moment, Deputy Platoon Leader Li Mingshan and Squad Leader Luo Jixiang carried a coil of hundreds of meters of coir rope, gave one end of the rope to the administrator, tied the other end around their waists, and jumped into the sea, rushing towards the wooden boat against the surging waves. Then, Luo Jixiang, Zhao Zengming, Hou You and other comrades who were best at swimming and most familiar with the sea conditions also jumped down.

The giant waves repeatedly swept them into the water. People watched the heroic soldiers nervously. After more than twenty minutes of fighting, they finally conquered the raging waves, brought the coir rope to the boat, and the comrades on the shore cheered and worked hard to drag the boat to the shore. The soldiers boarded the boat to greet the seven Korean brothers. The fifty-year-old Korean Captain Lin Cheng-san, who had been unconscious, opened his eyes and said excitedly, "With you, we are saved!" The soldiers and residents of the island, upon hearing that Korean fishermen had arrived, sent cigarettes, vegetables, and eggs. The People's Liberation Army soldiers also sent dry clothes, the doctor was busy examining them, and the cook prepared delicious meals for them. The island suddenly became lively.

At the same time, on another island, a fishing boat of the local fishery production brigade that was out at sea was capsized by the storm and drifted with the waves on the sea more than two thousand meters from the island. The boat was bottom up, sometimes lifted high by mountain-like waves, and sometimes swallowed in the treacherous giant waves. The three people on board desperately hugged the hull of the boat, not letting the waves sweep them away. At the critical moment, a large motorized sailing boat came from the sea, approaching the island with the storm. It turned out that this was a fishing boat from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that had been swept away by the wind and waves. After Korean Captain Wu Tai-ren and three fishermen landed ashore, they learned that a Chinese fishing boat had encountered disaster at sea and was in a very dangerous situation. They immediately turned the bow and, together with Yang Zhongxian, the company commander of the Chinese garrison on the island, as well as the deputy company commander and four soldiers, sailed against the strong wind and through the stormy waves toward the Chinese fishing boat that was rolling in the waves. The waves hit the hull fiercely, making a loud rumbling sound, and the spray, like a wide white cloth, came again and again. Company Commander Yang Zhongxian and Korean crew member Lin Huabin were knocked down on the deck several times by the oncoming waves. The three Chinese fishermen in distress were overjoyed to see their Korean friends extending a helping hand. After they were rescued, they immediately told the company commander and the Korean captain that two other people had been swept into the sea and did not know where they had been carried. So the Korean boat risked again searching back and forth at sea, and finally rescued two fishermen who were tightly holding onto a small sampan, rolling back and forth in the rushing waves.

The next day, the news of the rescue of the Chinese and Korean fishing boats spread between the two islands, and it was learned that the two Korean fishing boats had originally sailed out together to fish. On the night of the 28th, the fierce wind and waves broke the cable connecting the two boats, and they lost contact with each other in the darkness. On the 31st, the large motorized sailing boat was escorted to × Island. When the eleven Korean fishermen on the two boats met safely on Chinese soil, many people's eyes filled with grateful tears.

At the celebration of the 33rd anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day by the military and civilians on the island, eleven guests from fraternal countries were added. Everyone enjoyed themselves to the fullest, celebrating the birthday of the People's Liberation Army and the life-and-death friendship forged by the Chinese and Korean people jointly overcoming the stormy waves.

On August 6th, Kim Si-tae, Deputy Director of the South Pyongan Province Aquatic Products Bureau of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, brought two thousand catties of apples and the deep affection of thirty million Korean people to the island to express condolences to the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army garrison. The troops and fishermen on the island helped rush to repair the damaged Korean fishing boats day and night in order to help the Korean brothers return to their homeland. On the 8th, the military and civilians on the island bid farewell to their Korean friends with a feeling of attachment. The People's Liberation Army soldiers sailed the two boats full of Sino-Korean friendship for hundreds of miles before reluctantly saying goodbye.

    惊涛骇浪中的生死情谊
    记中朝人民同心协力抢救渔船的故事
    郭锡侯
    7月29日，黄海上同时发生了两起冒着生命危险，在惊涛骇浪中抢救渔船的故事。这是又一支中朝友谊之歌。
    28日晚，在辽东半岛和西朝鲜湾的海面上，突然刮起了九级以上的风暴，海上卷起了惊心动魄的巨浪。驻守在某岛了望哨所的战士，从望远镜里发现一只木船，船头露出水面，后半截淹没在波浪中。这只船被猛烈的东南风和巨浪卷着，顺着潮水从公海往岛上飘来。显然这只船已经被狂风巨浪打坏了。哨长颜范才几次向木船发出联络信号，都没有得到回答。29日早晨八点多钟，船被卷到离岛一千多米的地方。颜范才再次发出联络信号，才见一个人从灌满了水的船舱中挣扎着站起来，举起一面朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗。
    “看！兄弟邻邦的渔船，准备抢救，绝不让它遭到不幸。”副排长李明山发出了号召。
    船仍被风浪卷着往岛子冲来，离岛只有四百米了，眼看着就要撞进满布暗礁的危险区。在这紧急关头，管理员任正水带着二十多个战士迎上去，并向来船发出了抛锚停止前进的信号。几个解放军朝鲜族战士用朝鲜语高声喊着：“赶快抛锚，注意暗礁。”船上抛锚了，船在风浪中来回颠簸，船上的人被抛来抛去。就在这时候，副排长李明山和班长罗吉祥抬来了一卷数百米长的棕缆绳，把绳的一头给了管理员，另一头系在自己腰上，然后跳入海中，迎着汹涌奔腾的巨浪向木船奔去。接着，罗吉祥、赵增明、侯友等几个水性最好、对海情最熟悉的同志也跳了下去。
    巨浪几次把他们卷到水里，人们紧张地注视着英勇的战士，经过二十多分钟的搏斗，他们终于战胜了恶浪，把棕缆绳带到船上，岸上的同志们在一片欢呼声中，奋力将船拖向海岸。战士们上船迎接船上的七个朝鲜兄弟。五十多岁的朝鲜老船长林成三在昏迷中睁开眼睛激动地说：“有了你们，我们得救啦！”战士们和岛上居民们听说迎来了朝鲜渔民，纷纷派人送来香烟、蔬菜和鸡蛋，解放军战士还送来了干衣服，医生忙着为他们检查身体，炊事员为他们作了可口的饭菜，岛上顿时热闹起来了。
    就在这同时，在另外一个岛上，当地渔业生产大队出海的一只渔船被风暴卷翻了，在离岛二千多米的海面上随波逐流。这只船船底朝上，时而被小山似的浪头高高举起，时而又被吞没在凶险的巨浪里。船上三个人拼命地抱住船身，不让浪头卷走。正当危急的时候，从海上来了一只大机帆船，顺着狂风巨浪靠近岛子。原来这是一只朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的渔船，是被风浪卷来的。朝鲜渔船船长吴太仁和三个渔民靠岸以后，知道有一只中国渔船在海上遇难，处境万分危险，他们就立即掉转船头，协同岛上的中国驻军连长杨中贤以及副连长和四个战士一起，迎着强风，穿破惊涛骇浪，驶向正在波涛中翻滚的中国渔船。海浪猛烈扑打着船身，发出了剧烈的轰隆声，水花像一匹又宽又大的白布，一次又一次铺天盖地地袭来。连长杨中贤和朝鲜船员林华彬几次被猛扑过来的浪头打倒在甲板上。处在危难中的三个中国渔民，看见朝鲜朋友伸出了援助的手，真是喜出望外。当他们被救上船以后，立即告诉连长和朝鲜船长，还有两个人被打入海中，不知卷到哪里去了。于是这只朝鲜船又冒着风险在海上来回寻找，终于把两个紧抱着一只小舢板，在奔腾的海浪中来回滚翻的渔民救了起来。
    第二天，中朝两国渔船得救的消息在这两个岛子之间传开了，才知道这两只朝鲜渔船原来是一起出航捕鱼的。在28日夜间，狂风巨浪把连接两只船的缆绳冲折了，彼此在黑暗中失掉了联系。31日，这只大机帆船被护送到了×岛。两只船上十一个朝鲜渔民在中国的土地上平安地会见的时候，许多人的眼里涌出了感激的热泪。
    在岛上军民庆祝“八一”建军节三十三周年的联欢会上，新添了十一个兄弟国家的客人，大家尽情地欢乐，欢庆人民解放军的生日，欢庆中朝人民共同战胜惊涛骇浪结下的生死情谊。
    8月6日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国平安南道水烹管理局副局长金时泰带着两千斤苹果和三千万朝鲜人民的深情厚意，来到岛上慰问中国人民解放军驻军官兵。部队和岛上渔民为了帮助朝鲜兄弟返回祖国，日夜帮助赶修被打坏了的朝鲜渔船。8日，岛上军民怀着依恋的心情送别朝鲜朋友。解放军战士乘船把这两只满载中朝友谊的船送出几百里外，然后依依而别。
