Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, 29th. Delegates from various countries attending the Third World Teachers' Conference today condemned the cultural aggression of imperialists and colonialists in their speeches, and expressed their firm support for national independence movements.

    Fang Ming, head of the Chinese delegation and vice chairman of the National Committee of the Educational Workers' Union of China, said in his speech that all facts prove that the day is not far off when the great African peoples will once again become masters of the entire African continent, and the moment when imperialist colonial rule will completely collapse is approaching.

    He said that as we celebrate the birth of some new African countries and the continuous victories of the national independence movement in Africa, we must not forget the significant contribution made by the Algerian people to the struggle for national independence of the African peoples. The heroic Algerian people, who have persevered in the war of resistance for six years, have dealt a heavy blow to the French aggressors and provided a brilliant example for the African peoples striving for national independence.

    He said that recently, Belgian colonialists, with the support of American imperialists, launched a savage armed intervention against the newly independent Congo. The army and people of the Congo, with the profound sympathy and support of the entire African and world's people, have waged a heroic struggle to defend their independence.

    He said that in Latin America, the struggle against American imperialist aggression and interference is also rising irresistibly. One dictatorial regime after another supported by the United States has been overthrown. The victory of the Cuban People's Revolution greatly encouraged the fighting spirit and confidence of the peoples of Latin American countries.

    Fang Ming emphasized that the Chinese people and teachers resolutely support the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, resolutely support the struggle against racial discrimination, and resolutely support the struggles of the people of all capitalist countries for peace, democracy, and social progress. We always believe that the struggles of the people of all countries are a support for the Chinese people, and the victories they win in their struggles are our common victories.

    He finally pointed out that cultural aggression is an inseparable part of imperialism, especially American imperialism. The Chinese people and intellectuals, like the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, have had many experiences with imperialist cultural aggression. Under the guise of so-called "cultural cooperation" and "technical assistance," imperialists try every means to promote their so-called "civilization," with the aim of paralyzing the oppressed peoples of all countries, eroding their fighting will, and trying to cultivate social forces among intellectuals to serve imperialism in order to strengthen their control and rule in these countries.

    Jeanne Martin, the representative of the Women's International Democratic Federation, said that in Africa, most women are illiterate and children cannot attend school. Imperialists and colonialists are determined to keep Africa in a culturally backward state.

    Goncharov, head of the Soviet delegation and vice president of the Academy of Educational Sciences of the Russian Federal Republic, said in his speech that the characteristic of the current era is the upsurge of national liberation movements and the fact that many colonies and dependent countries have embarked on the road of independent development. He said that the poverty of the masses caused by the brutal exploitation and plunder of imperialist countries has always been a major obstacle to the popularization of education in the past and present. He pointed out that in the United States, tens of thousands of young people who yearn for further education are unable to attend school because they cannot afford tuition fees.

    Suzuki, head of the Japanese delegation, condemned American imperialists for trying every possible means to intensify international tensions. He accused American imperialists and Japanese monopoly capital groups of colluding to conclude the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." He pointed out that Japanese workers, farmers, intellectuals, and the majority of the people have launched a struggle against the ratification of the revised Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and to abolish this treaty. This struggle has reached an unprecedentedly large scale, thwarting the war-makers represented by the Kishi Nobusuke government and exposing their conspiracies and tricks.

    The delegation of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on the situation in the Congo at the meeting, saying that the workers of the German Democratic Republic and their trade union organizations are extremely angry at the Belgian army's aggression against this young republic. The statement said that the attitude of West German militarists on the Congo issue once again exposes that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an organization against the peoples of independent countries. The West German government provides West German airports for the use of Belgian and American paratroopers in order to send these troops to the Congo. The statement said that the working class of the German Democratic Republic expresses its full support for the workers and all the people of the Republic of the Congo.

    The Iraqi delegation stated in its speech that it firmly supports the struggle of the people of African and Latin American countries for liberation.

    我国代表方明在世界教师大会上指出
    中国人民坚决支持各国民族独立斗争
    帝国主义利用文化侵略磨灭受压迫人民的斗志
    新华社科纳克里29日电　参加第三次世界教师大会的各国代表今天在会上讲话中纷纷谴责帝国主义和殖民主义者的文化侵略，并表示坚决支持民族独立运动。
    中国代表团团长、中国教育工会全国委员会副主席方明在讲话中说，一切事实都证明，伟大的非洲各国人民重新成为整个非洲大陆的主人的日子已经不远了，帝国主义殖民统治完全瓦解的时刻日益临近。
    他说，在我们庆祝一些新的非洲国家的诞生和在非洲争取民族独立运动不断获得胜利的时候，我们不能忘记阿尔及利亚人民对非洲各国人民争取民族独立的斗争所作出的重大贡献。六年来坚持不渝地进行抗战的英勇的阿尔及利亚人民，已给予法国侵略者以沉重的打击，并为争取民族独立的非洲各国人民提供了光辉的范例。
    他说，最近，比利时殖民主义者在美帝国主义者支持下，对新近获得独立的刚果发动了野蛮的武装干涉。刚果的军队和人民，得到整个非洲和全世界各国人民的深刻同情和支持，他们为保卫自己已经获得的独立进行了英勇的斗争。
    他说，在拉丁美洲，反对美帝国主义侵略和干涉的斗争，也正在势不可当地兴起。美国所支持的独裁政权，一个接着一个被推翻。古巴人民革命的胜利，大大地鼓舞了拉丁美洲各国人民的斗志和信心。
    方明强调指出，中国人民和教师们坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的民族民主运动，坚决支持反对种族歧视的斗争，坚决支持各资本主义国家人民为和平、民主和社会进步而进行的斗争。我们始终认为，所有国家人民的斗争，是对中国人民的支持，他们在斗争中赢得的胜利就是我们共同的胜利。
    他最后指出，文化侵略，是帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义侵略的不可分的一部分。中国人民和知识分子，像亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的人民一样，对于帝国主义文化侵略有过很多的经历。在所谓“文化合作”和“技术援助”等等借口之下，帝国主义者想尽办法来宣传他们的所谓“文明”，其目的在于麻痹被压迫各国人民，磨灭他们的斗志，并设法在知识分子中扶植社会势力来为帝国主义服务，以便加强他们在这些国家中的控制和统治。
    国际民主妇女联合会的代表让娜·马丹夫人说，在非洲，大部分妇女都是文盲，儿童不能入学，帝国主义和殖民主义者决意使非洲在文化上处于落后状态。
    苏联代表团团长、俄罗斯联邦共和国教育科学院副院长冈恰罗夫在讲话中指出，当前时代的特征是民族解放运动的高涨、许多殖民地和附属国走上了独立发展的道路。他说，帝国主义国家的残酷剥削和掠夺所造成的群众的贫困处境，过去和现在始终是教育普及到群众中去的重大障碍。他指出，在美国，数以万计的渴望深造的青年由于无力担负学费而不能入学。
    日本代表团团长铃木谴责美帝国主义者正在千方百计地加剧国际紧张局势。他指责美帝国主义者和日本垄断资本集团勾结，缔结了新日美“安全条约”。他指出，日本的工人、农民、知识分子以及大多数人民，展开了反对批准经过修改的日美“安全条约”和争取废除这个条约的斗争。这个斗争达到空前巨大的规模，使以岸信介政府为代表的战争制造者碰壁，并且揭露了他们的阴谋诡计。
    德意志民主共和国代表团在会上就刚果局势发表声明说，德意志民主共和国的工人和他们的工会组织对比利时军队侵略这个年青的共和国感到极大的愤怒。声明说，西德军国主义者在刚果问题上的态度，再一次暴露了北大西洋公约组织是反对独立国家人民的组织。西德政府把西德机场供比利时和美国伞兵部队使用，以便把这些部队遣往刚果。声明说，德意志民主共和国的工人阶级表示完全支持刚果共和国的工人和全体人民。
    伊拉克代表团在讲话中表示坚决支持非洲和拉丁美洲国家人民争取解放的斗争。
