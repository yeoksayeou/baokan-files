    Seize the Season and Expand Planting Again
    Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Shanghai Tap Land Potential to Plant Coarse Grains Extensively
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangdong Province had planted 9.4 million mu of autumn-harvested coarse grains such as sweet potatoes, corn, sorghum, millet, and miscellaneous beans by the 16th, an increase of 3 million mu compared to the same period last year. Currently, various regions are seizing the opportunity after the rain to continue vigorously expanding the planting of coarse grains. Regions that have already completed their expansion plans have launched a second high tide of rushing to plant coarse grains, striving for more planting and higher yields to seize a bumper late-season grain harvest this year.
    This year, the momentum, scale, and enthusiasm for expanding the planting of coarse grains in Guangdong are significantly greater than in previous years. Not only is planting earlier and the area larger, but the quality is also better than in previous years. Based on the experience of launching a mass movement for spring-sown coarse grains and rushing to plant during the gaps before and after the busy farming season, nearly 3 million mu of coarse grains had already been planted before the summer harvest, changing the past planting habit of starting around the “Beginning of Autumn” and slowly planting after the “End of Heat.” Most of the autumn sweet potatoes planted in various regions were selected from improved varieties, the spacing between plants was appropriately increased, and management was strengthened along with planting, enhancing weeding, soil loosening, and topdressing.
    Guangdong's great achievements in coarse grain sowing this year are mainly due to the importance attached by the Party committees and early arrangements. After the start of spring plowing, the Provincial Party Committee clearly pointed out that the province's grain production must focus on both rice production and coarse grains, vigorously expanding the planting area of coarse grains. When arranging grain production, the local committees and county committees also carefully and uniformly arranged coarse grain production. Many county party secretaries and commune party secretaries led cadres and members to investigate and eliminate wasteland, strengthening leadership in the expansion work.
    Many regions have solved the land problem for expanding the planting of coarse grain crops through comprehensive surveys and tapping land potential. In the Chao汕 (Chao Shan) Plain, where arable land is scarce, full use is made of scattered land, and intercropping and multiple cropping are comprehensively promoted, ensuring the smooth completion of the expansion plan.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, grasping both staple grains and coarse grains, striving to plant more and better, people's communes in Jiangxi Province have taken advantage of the favorable weather after the rain to rush to plant more than 7 million mu of coarse grain crops. At present, various regions are still in the midst of the rushing to plant.
    Since the beginning of August, there has been widespread rain in various parts of Jiangxi Province, and the masses have been very enthusiastic about rushing to plant. A few areas without rainfall have also concentrated their efforts on fighting drought and rushing to plant. Ji'an County launched a large-scale "Expansion Planting Week," mobilizing more than 70,000 laborers to rush to plant. In just two days, they rushed to plant more than 77,000 mu of sweet potatoes and soybeans. Some brigades in the Nainaimiao Commune of this county lacked water, so the members used seven or eight waterwheels to draw water from the Gan River to irrigate the fields and rush to plant late autumn crops. Luohu Commune's Yuxi Brigade in Linchuan County made full use of "five sides" and "ten edges" to expand the planting of more than 100 mu of late autumn crops such as sweet potatoes and soybeans, making sure that every inch of land was used and no autumn idle land was left. Some areas also used cotton, sugarcane and other crops to interplant. Liaonan Commune in Xingzi County expanded the planting of 5,000 mu of late coarse grains, of which 3,000 mu were interplanted.
    In the rushing to plant, all regions have paid close attention to the quality of planting, ensuring planting, survival, and harvest. Houshan Commune in Jinxi County carefully cultivated the land for planting coarse grain crops, achieving one plowing, three harrows, deep plowing and fine harrowing, and applying sufficient base fertilizer. Shishan Commune in Nanfeng County applied fertilizer before transplanting the sweet potatoes. Various regions have irrigated late autumn crops such as transplanted sweet potatoes and dotted soybeans in a timely manner, ensuring rapid greening and rapid emergence.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hunan Province is seizing the golden season before and after the "End of Heat" to expand the planting of coarse grain crops in every possible way, striving to increase autumn grain production. As of the 15th, the province had sown 3,497,000 mu of autumn sweet potatoes, autumn soybeans, and autumn buckwheat.
    The planting area of autumn coarse grains and double-cropping late rice in Hunan Province accounts for about half of the total area of grain crops in the province. In order to strive to overfulfill the annual grain production plan, after overfulfilling the late rice planting plan, farmers across the province immediately seized the opportunity to find gaps and practice intercropping and multiple cropping, and tried every possible means to expand the planting area of autumn coarse grain crops. Taking advantage of the favorable weather after the rain, Hengyang Prefecture mobilized 100,000 laborers to engage in intercropping and multiple cropping, making full use of vacant land and gaps, and rushed to plant 368,800 mu of coarse grain crops in two days, and also filled the missing seedlings for 52,000 mu of summer-planted sweet potatoes. Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County has many mountains and little land. In addition to seizing the planting of large tracts of land, it also intercrops coarse grains in forest land. Gushan Commune in Changsha County summarized and promoted the method of tapping land potential, such as not leaving an inch of land idle in Chigang Brigade and intercropping grain and vegetables, so that the commune completed the autumn coarse grain sowing plan ahead of schedule.
    Fully mobilizing the masses and adjusting the surplus and deficiency of seedlings and varieties as early as possible are effective methods for Hunan Province to ensure the completion of the coarse grain sowing plan. The autumn coarse grains and vegetables sown in Yuanling County this year will expand by 69.71% compared to last year. Ten of the sixteen communes in the county have mutually adjusted the surplus and deficiency in terms of the quantity and variety of seedlings according to the principle of equivalent exchange. Due to the promotion of the spirit of cooperation, the sowing progress has been greatly accelerated.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the eleven suburban counties of Shanghai are seizing the time and season, making full use of vacant land to plant late autumn crops. As of the 15th, the counties had used early rice fields, double-cropping late rice seedling fields, and rapeseed seedling fields to plant 110,000 mu of adzuki beans, mung beans, buckwheat, and late yams.
    Making full use of vacant land to plant late autumn crops is an important measure for suburban counties in Shanghai to vigorously grasp grain production and implement the policy of "planting more and harvesting more, and achieving high yields and more harvests." Before the late autumn crops began to be planted, Party organizations in suburban counties conducted education on "taking grain as the key link" for the majority of cadres and members through various meetings, helping everyone to further clarify that grain is the foundation of the foundation, and that we must use all available land to plant more and harvest more. On this basis, the communes carefully calculated accounts, arranged stubble, and quickly launched a campaign to plant late autumn crops. The number of people in Fengxian, Baoshan and other counties who participated in rushing to plant late autumn crops exceeded 10,000. Responding to the county party committee's call of "planting every point is every point," the vast number of cadres and members in Chuansha County had planted more than 22,000 mu of late autumn crops by the 15th, exceeding the original plan by 10,000 mu.

    抓紧季节　扩种再扩种
    广东江西湖南上海挖掘土地潜力大种杂粮
    据新华社讯　广东省到16日止已种下番薯、玉米、高粱、粟、杂豆等秋收杂粮作物九百四十万亩，比去年同期增加三百万亩。现在，各地抓紧雨后良机继续大力扩种杂粮；已经完成扩种计划的地区又掀起第二次抢种杂粮的高潮，力争多种、高产，夺取今年晚造粮食丰收。
    今年广东扩种杂粮的声势、规模和干劲都大大胜过往年，不但种得早、面积大，质量也比往年好。根据春种杂粮采取大搞群众运动，抓紧农忙前后空隙突击抢种的经验，早在夏收以前全省就已种下近三百万亩杂粮，改变了过去“立秋”动手、“处暑”大种慢慢来的种植习惯。各地种植的秋番薯大部分选用了良种，株距适当加密，并且随种随管，加强了除草、松土和追肥工作。
    广东今年杂粮播种取得很大成绩，主要是党委重视，早作安排。省委在春耕开始后即明确指出：全省粮食生产必须在搞好水稻生产的同时大抓杂粮，大力扩大杂粮种植面积。各地委、县委在安排粮食生产时，也认真地统一安排了杂粮生产。许多县委书记、公社党委书记都带领干部、社员查荒灭荒，加强了扩种工作的领导。
    许多地区通过全面勘察、挖掘土地潜力，解决了扩种杂粮作物的土地问题。耕地较少的潮汕平原，充分利用零星土地，并且全面推广间种套种，保证了扩种计划的顺利完成。
    据新华社讯　既抓主粮又抓杂粮，力争种多、种好，江西省各人民公社已趁雨后有利时机突击抢种杂粮作物七百多万亩。目前，各地仍处在抢种高潮中。
    8月上旬以来，江西省各地普降喜雨，群众的抢种劲头很大；少数没有降雨的地区，也集中力量抗旱抢种。吉安县开展声势浩大的“扩种周”，出动七万多个劳动力突击，仅两天时间就抢种红薯、大豆七万七千多亩。这个县的奶奶庙公社有些大队缺水，社员们便用七、八架水车从赣江车水来灌田，抢种下晚秋作物。临川县罗湖公社?溪大队充分利用“五旁”、“十边”，扩种红薯、大豆等晚秋作物一百多亩，做到寸土必用，不留秋闲田。有些地区还利用棉花、甘蔗等作物土地套种。星子县蓼南公社扩种五千亩晚杂粮，其中就有三千亩是套种的。
    在抢种中，各地都十分注意栽种质量，保种保活保收。金溪县厚山公社对种杂粮作物的土地进行了精细整理，做到一犁三耙、深耕耙细，施足基肥。南丰县市山公社插的红薯，都先施肥后插秧。各地对插下的红薯、点播大豆等晚秋作物，都及时进行了灌溉，保证了转青快，出苗快。
    据新华社讯　湖南省抓紧“处暑”前后的黄金季节千方百计扩种杂粮作物，力争增加秋季粮食产量。到15日止，全省已播种秋红薯、秋大豆、秋荞麦等三百四十九万七千亩。
    湖南省秋杂粮和双季晚稻的播种面积约占全省粮食作物总面积的半数。为了争取超额完成全年粮食生产计划，全省农民最近在超额完成了晚稻种植计划之后，立即抓紧时机，找缝插针，大搞间作套种，千方百计扩大秋季杂粮作物的播种面积。衡阳专区趁雨后有利时机，动员十万劳动力大搞间种套种，充分利用空坪隙地，两天就抢种杂粮作物三十六万八千亩，还给五万二千亩夏种甘薯补了缺蔸。新晃侗族自治县山多田少，除抓紧种大片土地外，并在林地间种杂粮。长沙县谷山公社总结推广了赤岗大队寸土不闲，粮菜间种等挖掘土地潜力的办法，使全社提前完成了秋杂粮播种计划。
    充分发动群众，及早调剂种苗余缺和品种，是湖南省保证完成杂粮播种计划的有效方法。沅陵县今年播种的秋杂粮、蔬菜将比去年扩大69.71％，全县十六个公社就有十个公社在种苗数量与品种上，按照等价交换的原则互相调剂余缺。由于发扬协作精神，大大加快了播种进度。
    据新华社讯　上海市郊十一个县正在抢时间抓季节，充分利用空闲地大种晚秋作物。到15日止，各县已利用早稻田、双季晚稻秧田、油菜育秧田种下赤豆、绿豆、荞麦、晚山芋等十一万亩。
    利用空闲地大种晚秋作物，是上海郊区各县大抓粮食生产，贯彻“多种多收和高产多收”方针的一项重要措施。晚秋作物开始种植前，郊区各县党组织通过各种会议，向广大干部和社员进行了“以粮为纲”的教育，帮助大家进一步明确了粮食是基础的基础，一定要利用一切可以利用的土地多种多收，在这个基础上，各公社算细账、排茬口，迅速掀起大种晚秋作物的突击运动，奉贤、宝山等县投入抢种晚秋的人数都在万人以上。川沙县广大干部和社员响应县委“多种一分是一分”的号召，到15日止已种晚秋作物二万二千多亩，超过原计划一万亩。
