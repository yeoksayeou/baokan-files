Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 4th: The broad masses of workers and staff in Northern Vietnam are presenting gifts to the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Third Congress of the Labor Party by completing production plans ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas with practical actions.

The basic construction department of the Hanoi Electricity Company completed its three-year plan five months and ten days ahead of schedule on July 20th, completing a total of 330 construction projects, becoming one of the first departments in the North to complete its three-year plan. In the labor emulation drive, the workers in the company's basic construction department also put forward many rationalization proposals, saving a lot of expenses for the country and users.

The famous Gia Lam Machine Factory completed its three-year plan production task 160 days ahead of schedule on July 23rd, exceeding the quota by 0.42%. Because this factory has exceeded its plan every year, it has been awarded the third-class Labor Medal by the government.

Since July, there has been continuous rain in Northern Vietnam, which has brought great difficulties to production. However, thanks to the heroic struggle of the workers and staff, many enterprises and construction sites have completed their July plans ahead of schedule.

The workers in the rotary kiln workshop of the famous Hai Phong Cement Plant exceeded their full-month production plan on July 22nd, producing an additional 1,000 tons of cement. When this workshop overhauled the No. 2 rotary kiln, it was originally scheduled to be repaired in 15 days, but with the enthusiastic efforts of the workers, it was repaired in only eight days.

The workers and staff of the Phu Tho Phosphate Fertilizer Plant construction site tried every means to overcome the difficulties brought about by the rainy season, ensured the normal progress of the project, and exceeded the July production plan by 7%.

At present, the workers and staff of various departments, enterprises, and construction sites in Northern Vietnam have launched a new wave of labor enthusiasm, striving to make greater production achievements to present gifts to the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Republic and the Third Congress of the Labor Party. On the evening of the 2nd, 7,500 young people in Hanoi held a gathering at the People's Theater and launched a competition campaign of "Holding High the Red Flag of August and Making Meritorious Service in Production."

The workers and staff of the modern Hanoi Machine Manufacturing Factory held a factory-wide staff meeting on the same day, expressing their determination to complete the three-year plan and the 1960 production plan three months or one month ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 5th: Polish workers, soldiers, students, and government officials have responded to the call of the government, trade unions, and youth organizations and have gone to the countryside to support the summer harvest.

Due to continuous rain since mid-July, Poland's summer harvest has been delayed compared to previous years. In the past few days, the weather has cleared up, and the Polish countryside has immediately presented a busy scene of agricultural activity, with farmers engaged in intense harvesting work. However, because the land is wet, many places cannot use combine harvesters and heavy agricultural machinery for harvesting and must use sickles, which requires a large amount of labor. After the Polish government, trade unions, and youth organizations issued a call to the people of the whole country to vigorously support the summer harvest, a wave of vigorously supporting the countryside was set off among Polish workers, soldiers, students, and government officials. They organized support summer harvest work teams and went to the countryside to participate in the harvest rush. On August 2nd, about 2,500 workers from Upper Silesia went to the countryside to help with harvesting, 1,500 workers from the Opole Province helped with the summer harvest on state farms, and more than 5,000 young men and women from the Lublin region responded to the call and went to the countryside to participate in the harvesting work. Local police and troops also actively helped farmers with the harvest rush. Many workers and staff of industrial and mining enterprises and government officials also went to the countryside on weekends to help farmers with harvesting. Farmers are also seizing the time to participate in the harvest rush. In order to make full use of the sunny weather, everyone worked from dawn to late at night, and the harvesting work in many areas has been progressing very smoothly.

Thanks to the efforts of people in various places, the summer harvest work in many provinces is about to end. The barley in Warsaw Province and the rye in Krakow Province have all been harvested.

    波兰城市人民响应号召下乡支援夏收
    新华社河内4日电　越南北方广大职工正以提前和超额完成生产计划的实际行动向越南民主共和国成立十五周年和劳动党第三次代表大会献礼。
    河内电力公司基本建设部门在7月20日提前五个月零十天完成三年计划，完成建设项目共三百三十项，成为北方最先完成三年计划的一个部门。在劳动竞赛中，这个公司的基本建设部门的工人还提出了许多合理化建议，为国家和用户节省了大量开支。
    著名的嘉林机器厂在7月23日提前一百六十天超额0.42％完成了三年计划的生产任务。这个工厂由于年年都超额完成计划，曾荣获政府授予的三级劳动勋章。
    7月以来，越南北方阴雨连绵，给生产带来很大困难。但在职工们的英勇奋战下，许多企业、工地提前完成了7月份计划。
    著名的海防水泥厂回转车间的工人，在7月22日就超额完成了全月生产计划，多生产水泥一千吨。这个车间在中修第二号回转窑时，原定十五天修好，但在工人的热情奋战下，仅用八天的时间就修好了。
    富寿磷肥厂建设工地的职工，想尽了各种办法，克服了雨季带来的困难，保证了工程的正常进行，超额7％完成了7月份生产计划。
    目前，越南北方各部门、企业和工地的职工，又掀起了新的劳动热潮，争取做出更大的生产成绩向共和国成立十五周年和劳动党第三次代表大会献礼。2日晚上，河内七千五百名青年在人民剧场举行了集会，发起了“高举8月红旗，生产立功”的竞赛运动。
    现代化的河内机器制造厂的职工，在同一天召开了全厂职工大会，表示争取提前三个月或一个月完成三年计划和1960年的生产计划。
    新华社华沙5日电　波兰工人、战士、学生和机关干部响应政府、工会和青年组织的号召，纷纷下乡支援夏收。
    由于7月中旬以来接连不断地下雨，波兰今年的夏收比往年推迟了。最近几天，天气放晴，波兰农村立即呈现出一片农忙的景象，农民们投入了紧张的抢收工作。但由于土地潮湿，很多地方不能用收割联合机和重型农业机器来收割，而必须使用镰刀，因此就需要大量的劳动力。当波兰政府、工会和青年组织向全国人民发出了号召，要求大家大力支援夏收工作以后，在波兰工人、战士、学生和机关干部中就掀起了一个大力支援农村的热潮。他们纷纷组织了支援夏收的工作队，下乡进行抢收。在8月2日，上西里西亚就约有二千五百名工人下乡帮助收割，奥波累省有一千五百名工人在国营农场帮助夏收，卢布林地区也有五千多名男女青年响应号召，下乡参加收割工作。各地的民警和军队也积极帮助农民抢收。很多工矿企业的工人和机关干部还利用星期天下乡帮助农民收割。农民们更是抓紧时间进行抢收。为了充分利用晴天的时间，大家从黎明一直劳动到深夜，很多地区的收割工作都进行得很顺利。
    由于各地人民的努力，许多省份的夏收工作即将结束。华沙省的大麦和克拉科夫省的稞麦已全部收割完毕。
