The Eighth Company of a certain unit stationed on a small island in the South China Sea of the motherland is a young company, but in its short company history, it has written a glorious and proud chapter. The glorious "Three-Eight Style" tradition of our army and the revolutionary spirit of hard work and struggle fly like a red flag over the island.
	I
In the early summer of 1956, under the leadership of Instructor Zhang Jingu, the company was ordered to move into this small island. In the troop's station, apart from the sparse, drought-resistant herbaceous plants with hard thorns, there was only the white sand beach. How to gain a foothold? There wasn't even a grass shed! Never mind, the ground is the bed and the sky is the tent, so let’s just sleep in the wilderness. Sleeping in the wilderness is nothing, but the problem of eating is a real problem. When vegetables transported from the mainland arrive, at least half of them are rotten. Sometimes there aren't even any rotten vegetables, so we just have to eat rice with salt water. Water is even more difficult. The clear spring water that drips from the rocks is only enough for the kitchen to cook rice.

God really played a trick on us. Soon after arriving on the island, we encountered a typhoon. Food couldn't be transported, and everyone was starving. The instructor was worried about everyone's food when an old man unexpectedly came in from the wind and rain. He carried a load, staggering, to everyone, put down the load, and took out sweet potatoes from the basket, distributing them to everyone one by one.

"You must be suffering! Eat, they are still freshly cooked," the old man said kindly.

Everyone was stunned, looking at the steaming sweet potatoes, then at the old man, and then at the instructor.

The instructor was also deeply moved by this, he stepped forward and held the old man's hand tightly, politely declining. The old man was very unhappy, saying he wouldn't take them back no matter what, and even complained that everyone didn't go to their village, only quietly worked for the people, and didn't even drink a sip of their water.

It seemed that we had to accept them. In the end, the instructor decided to accept them. The comrades ate the sweet potatoes, and their whole bodies and minds were warmed. This meal of sweet potatoes was indeed more fragrant than any feast.

The next day, the instructor invited the old man again and took all the comrades of the company to the top of the mountain. Facing the vast sea, everyone had many feelings.

"Right in this bay," the old man pointed, "Japanese devils' warships used to be anchored... Over there, before the Kuomintang reactionaries fled to Taiwan, they massacred innocent people on the island..."

A history condensed with blood and tears deeply touched the hearts of the comrades.

"Build the island into an impregnable fortress! Turn the island into a grave for burying the invaders!" The solemn vows from the depths of the comrades' hearts covered the roaring waves.

From that moment on, they began the difficult construction project of the island.
	II
Four years have passed.

Now, solid and beautiful barracks are neatly arranged on the beach. The Manila pine and eucalyptus trees around the camp area have become shady. A spacious open-air stage stands at the end of the flat parade ground. Extending from both sides of the stage are smooth running tracks. In the center of the camp area is a garden that concentrates the wisdom of all the officers and soldiers of the company. The tall and upright artificial mountain stands in the center of the garden. On its hard stones, the poems of the soldiers are engraved, expressing their most beautiful wishes.

On the hillside behind the barracks is an orchard with hundreds of fruits. Each year, demobilized veterans plant more than 2,500 fruit trees of various kinds. Over there, the two fish ponds covering nearly one hundred square meters were built by the comrades in a blitz and presented as a gift for the New Year's Day. There are many more things to describe, such as: herds of cattle and sheep running and playing on the mountain, fat pigs in the pens, flocks of chickens pecking at the ground...

What a beautiful picture! All of this was created by the soldiers with their own hands, brick by brick, grass by grass, tree by tree, shovelful of soil mixed with sweat, on the barren beach.

What is particularly worth mentioning is probably that green vegetable field!

Growing vegetables on the windy and severely water-scarce beach is indeed not an easy task. They experienced failures and setbacks, and they also had troubles and frustrations. However, under the leadership of the Party branch, they eliminated various obstacles, and the instructor took the lead in persevering with experiments, time after time. Finally, they improved the soil by mixing clay, applying base fertilizer, and burning plant ash; they used methods such as planting branches around the vegetable field, sowing deep pits, cultivating seedlings, pressing vines, removing excess vegetable leaves, and laying down vegetable racks to resist the threat of typhoons to melons and vegetables. They also dug three wells and more than ten pools to solve the problem of severe water shortage. In this way, they finally reaped a bumper harvest on that barren beach! Since the winter of 1957, they have achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables; by 1959, each person ate an average of more than two ounces of meat, one ounce and eight cents of fish, more than one ounce of oil, and more than one ounce of tofu per day. The material life of the troops has been greatly improved.
	III
The comrades of the Eighth Company not only created one miracle after another in the construction of the island, but also achieved outstanding results in military training, political and cultural education, club activities, and health work over the years, becoming a company with sustained and comprehensive leaps forward. Sky-high enthusiasm and a swift and decisive style are their characteristics and the most important factors for their success.

Every year, soldiers who are about to complete their service repeatedly apply for extended service, reluctant to leave this island and leave the company. Indeed, a united, friendly, and joyful big family kneads them into a ball of glue and synthesizes them into a piece of steel. Mutual help in thought, mutual consideration in life, competing to take on heavy tasks and letting others take on lighter tasks in work, and mutual teaching and learning in training are so natural and ordinary for them, and have long become a fashion. The exemplary role of cadres taking the lead in everything and their meticulous care for the soldiers make everyone even more moved.

Back in the early days of arriving on the island, when the troops were living in grass sheds, there was a strong wind at sea and it rained for several days in a row. The grass shed was blown down, and it rained both inside and outside. At that time, Instructor Zhang Jingu was not feeling well, but he vacated the company headquarters and asked the soldiers to live there, but no one was willing to go. In a stalemate, they had to squeeze together, encourage each other, and spend the stormy days together.

There are many more examples like this. It is this kind of collective that gives them the infinite power to open up the world and be invincible.

Not long ago, the comrades of the Eighth Company and the people of the island solemnly celebrated the fourth anniversary of the Eighth Company's arrival on the island. A magnificent and inspiring plan was put forward: they are determined to hold the red flag of Mao Zedong's military thought even higher, unite the people of the entire island, build the island even more beautiful and solid, and make it a beautiful paradise on earth in the South China Sea, and a steel fortress to defend the motherland!

    人间乐园　钢铁堡垒
    ——记南海小岛上的英雄战士	解放军副师长　陈光　参谋　杨振群
    守备在祖国南海一个小岛上的某部八连，是一个年轻的连队，可是在它那短短的连史上，却写上了光荣的值得自豪的篇章。我军光荣的传统的三八作风，艰苦奋斗的革命精神，就像一面红旗，飘扬在海岛上空。	一
    1956年初夏，在指导员张金贵同志的率领下，连队奉命进驻这个小岛。在部队的驻地，除了稀稀落落地点缀着硬刺般的耐旱的草本植物外，就只有白花花的沙滩了。怎样立足呢？连草棚都没有！没关系，地是床，天是帐，就在荒野露宿吧。荒野露宿算不了什么，吃的问题可也真的是问题。由大陆运来的蔬菜，运到的时候顶少得烂掉一半，有时连烂菜都没有，只好用盐水泡饭了。水，更困难，由岩石间一滴一滴流出来的清泉，只够伙房用来做饭。
    老天爷也真是作弄人，刚上岛不久就遭逢了台风，粮食运不来，大伙都在挨饿了。指导员正为大伙的吃食问题着急，意外地从风雨中来了一位老大爷。他挑着一担东西，踉踉跄跄地走到大伙跟前，放下担子，从箩筐里拿出蕃茨，一个个地分送给大家。
    “可把你们苦啦！吃吧，还是刚煮熟的呢。”老大爷亲切地说。
    大伙楞住了，对着热呼呼的蕃茨，望望老大爷又望望指导员。
    指导员也深深为这事情所感动，他走上前去紧紧握着老大爷的手，婉然谢绝了。老大爷很不高兴，说啥也不拿回去，还埋怨大伙不住到他们村里去，只知悄悄为百姓干活，也不喝他们一口水。
    看来是非收下不可了。最后指导员还是决定收下了。同志们吃着蕃茨，整个身心都温暖了。这顿蕃茨，确实要比什么会餐都还要香哩。
    第二天，指导员又请来了那位老大爷，把全连的同志带到山顶上去。面对浩瀚的大海，大伙都有不少的感慨。
    “就在这个湾”，老大爷指着说：“停泊过日本鬼子的兵舰……那头，国民党反动派逃往台湾前，惨杀过岛上无辜的百姓……”
    一部血泪凝成的历史，深深地打动了同志们的心。
    “把海岛建成铜墙铁壁！把海岛变成埋葬侵略者的坟墓！”同志们从肺腑里发出的庄严誓言，掩盖着咆哮的海浪。
    就从那个时候开始，他们开始了艰难的海岛建设工程。		二
    四年的时间过去了。
    现在，坚固、美丽的营房，整齐有序地排列在海滩。营区周围的马尼松、桉树，已绿树成荫。一座宽阔的露天舞台，立在平坦的大操场尽头。由舞台两侧伸展开去的是平整的跑道。营区的中心，是一座集中着全连官兵的智慧的花园，那座轩昂挺拔的假山，矗立在花园的中心，在它那坚硬的石头上，遍刻着战士们的诗篇，寄托着他们最美好的心愿。
    在那营房背后的山坡，是个百果园，一年一批的复员老兵，种下了各种果树二千五百多棵。那边，近百平方米的两口鱼塘，是同志们三天之内突击修起来献给元旦的礼物。要记述的东西还很多，比如：奔跑、嬉戏在山上的牛群和羊群，圈里的肥猪，遍地啄食的鸡群……
    这是多么优美的一幅画面啊！这都是战士们凭着一双手，一砖一瓦，一草一木，一锹土夹着一把汗在荒凉的沙滩上造就出来的。
    特别值得一提的恐怕还是那片绿油油的菜地吧！
    在多风和严重缺水的沙滩上种菜，确实不是一件轻而易举的事。他们经过失败，挫折，也有过苦恼，丧气。但是，在党支部的领导下，他们排除了各种障碍，由指导员带头坚持着试验，一次又一次，最后，他们用掺粘土、施底肥、烧草木灰的办法改良了土壤；用菜地周围插树枝、播种挖深坑、秧苗培土、压蔓、摘掉多余的菜叶、放倒菜架等办法，来抗击台风对瓜菜的威胁，他们还挖了三口井和十多个水池，解决了严重缺水的问题。就这样，在那一毛不长的海滩上，终于获得了丰收！从1957年冬开始，他们就达到蔬菜自给了；到1959年，平均每人每天吃到二两多肉，一两八钱鱼，一两多油，一两多豆腐。部队的物质生活，大大地改善了。		三
    八连的同志们，不但在海岛建设方面创造着一个又一个的奇迹，同时在军事训练、政治文化教育、俱乐部活动、卫生工作等方面，历年来都取得了优异的成绩，成为一个持续的全面跃进的连队。冲天的干劲，雷厉风行的作风，是他们的特色，也是他们取得成绩的最重要的因素。
    每年，服役将满的士兵们，总要一再申请超期服役，舍不得离开这个海岛，离开连队。的确，团结、友爱、欢乐的大家庭，把他们揉为一团胶，合成一块钢。思想上的互相帮助，生活中的互相体贴，工作中的争重让轻，训练中的互教互学，在他们是那么自然和平常，早已成为风尚。干部们事事带头的模范作用，对士兵无微不至的关怀，更使大家感动。
    还在上岛初期，部队住草棚的时候，有一次海上刮起大风，下着大雨，一连好几天。草棚给刮坏了，里外都下雨。当时指导员张金贵同志的身体正不舒服，他却把连部的房子让出来叫战士们去住，可是谁也不肯去，相持不下，他们就只好挤在一起，互相鼓励，共同度过风雨的时日。
    像这样的事例，还有好多好多。正是这样的集体，使他们产生了开天劈地、战无不胜的无穷力量。
    不久前，八连的同志们和岛上的人民，隆重地庆祝了八连进岛四周年纪念。一个雄伟壮丽的令人鼓舞的计划提出来了：他们决心更高地举起毛泽东军事思想红旗，团结全岛人民，把海岛建设得更加美丽、坚固，使它成为南海上一座美好的人间乐园，成为捍卫祖国的一座钢铁堡垒！
