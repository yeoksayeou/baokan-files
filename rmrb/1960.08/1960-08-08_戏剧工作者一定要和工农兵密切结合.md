    Theater Workers Must Closely Integrate with Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
    Ding Shi'e

    In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, we have achieved great success in implementing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction and the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new. Taking our Shanghai People's Shanghai Opera Troupe as an example, through performing in factories, in the countryside, and in the military, participating in labor, and living with workers, peasants, and soldiers, our thoughts, feelings, and worldview have begun to change. For example, when our troupe went to the Fujian front line last December to perform a慰问演出, the noble communist qualities of the People's Liberation Army comrades deeply educated us.

    I remember it was New Year's Eve in 1959, and a musician and I went to the most forward哨所 to perform慰问演唱. We saw that the place where a PLA soldier was standing guard was only a few kilometers away from the enemy's阵地. During the day, we could see the enemy's胸章 with binoculars. I stepped forward, shook his hand, which was frozen by the sea breeze, and said, "Comrade, you've worked hard!" He immediately replied, "Serve the people!" I had heard these five simple words thousands of times, but now they sounded particularly亲切 and powerful. I was so excited at the time that I wanted to sing a song to express my sincere respect to this哨兵 comrade. But the指导员婉转地 stopped me, saying, "It's relatively close to the enemy here, so let's skip it for safety's sake." I firmly said, "It doesn't matter, the战士 have been guarding here year after year without fear, what am I afraid of!" I improvised a few lines of lyrics and sang softly: "Riding the east wind, waving the red flag, celebrating 1960, wishing the heroes a happy new year..." Before I could finish singing, the哨兵 comrade gripped his冲锋枪, faced the enemy-occupied island, and solemnly said, "Dear folks, tell the people of the motherland to build socialism with peace of mind. We are guarding the door of the motherland!"

    Facing such a钢铁 person prompted me to consider many questions that I don't usually think deeply about.

    First, I thought about what kind of environment this was. A few kilometers away was the enemy-occupied island. Our 哨兵 comrades were on alert 24 hours a day, watching intently, not allowing imperialism and its accomplices to cross the雷池一步! Today is New Year's Eve, and more than 600 million people across the country are celebrating the festival, while the战士 at the front line are guarding the motherland's door in a state of "first-level combat readiness." If it were not for their arduous work and wholehearted service to the people, how could the more than 600 million people in the rear be able to celebrate the festival in a peaceful environment, and how could they have the time to devote themselves to peaceful socialist construction? Only by being in this specific situation could I more specifically and deeply realize the objective existence of the threat of war, and the aggression of imperialism was right in front of us!

    Modern revisionists spout nonsense that the crisis of war has disappeared, and desperately鼓吹 "active coexistence" between the two camps. This is completely睁着眼睛说瞎话! They vainly attempt to use this to disintegrate the socialist camp and paralyze the fighting will of the people of the world against imperialism, in order to protect the capitalist world. Their谰言 cannot蒙蔽 the eyes of the people of the world. We literary and artistic workers must wield our literary and artistic weapons to expose the lies of modern revisionists and use various methods to wage struggle against imperialism.

    Secondly, I thought: The Party constantly谆谆教导 us to serve the people wholeheartedly, but how much work have I actually done for the people? In the past, I片面地 believed that literary and art served the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and that going deep into the lives of the workers, peasants, and soldiers was just about going down to perform, promoting production, and鼓鼓群众干劲, but I neglected the most fundamental point, which is to integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, learn from them, and intensify self-transformation under their感染. Only on this basis can we generate the enthusiasm to love and express the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and only in this way can we more realistically and centrally establish the images of heroic figures. I realized the Party's wise and great policy of why it wants us to go into life and into the heat of struggle.

    In June of this year, during the Anti-American Imperialism Propaganda Week, our troupe重演ed "Jin Dalei." This play depicts the Chinese and Korean people fighting side by side against the common enemy—American imperialism. I played the role of Jin Dalei, a Korean woman in the play who spares no effort to rescue the Chinese People's Volunteers. In 1953, our troupe created and performed this play when we returned from a慰问演出 in Korea. During my stay in Korea, I consciously observed the lives of Korean working women, tried my best to get close to them, get to know them, and understand their thoughts and feelings. This brought great benefits to my later performances. However, even during rehearsals, it was still difficult for me to fully express the heroic character of the Jin Dalei role. After the performance at that time, a志愿军 comrade sharply criticized me, saying, "Why are you哭哭啼啼 in the scene where you send your husband to the front line? We have never seen such women in Korea." Why did I perform like this? Mainly because my hatred for imperialism was not as strong and deep as that of Korean women. In other words, there was still a distance between me and the role. This year, I重演 this play. Thanks to the Party's education, a series of political movements, and studying "All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers," especially through the 慰问 performance at the海防 front, I understood Chairman Mao's theory on war and peace, I understood the nature of imperialism's欺软怕硬, I clarified that true peace can only be obtained through struggle, and especially I gradually understood how the heroic character of heroic figures is formed and where their great spiritual strength comes from. My handling of the Jin Dalei role was very different. I realized that in order to defend the motherland, we must rise up and wage a resolute struggle, and only struggle can protect the liberated happy life. Therefore, when sending her husband to the front line, she can only be full of confidence and infinite hope, and will not哭哭啼啼.

    In "Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky," another play based on the advanced deeds of Wu Peifang, a teacher at a民办 primary school in Shanghai who insisted on the Party's education policy and started from scratch to run the民校 well, I also encountered a similar situation when creating the role of Lin Peifen (i.e., Wu Peifang) in the play. The third scene describes the民办 primary school teacher, who came from a family background, teaching her first lesson. Because she lacked experience, she only taught half of the lesson and could not teach any further, and the classroom order was also chaotic. When I first performed this part of the play, I said to the branch secretary with tears in my eyes, "A forty-minute lesson, I only taught for twenty minutes and had nothing more to say!" Saying this sentence carried the委屈 emotion of hating my own incompetence, expressing consideration of personal gains and losses. Every time I performed this part, the audience always burst into laughter, laughing at my pitiful and embarrassed appearance. I was very anxious and didn't know how I should perform it. Later, I went to consult the teacher Wu Peifang and asked her what she thought when she encountered such difficulties. She replied, "I only thought about not completing the task assigned to me by the Party and felt sad." This simple but meaningful answer was really a great education and inspiration to me. I deeply realized that the main reason why advanced figures are advanced is that they consider the Party's cause and the interests of the collective everywhere, not personal gains and losses.

    Modern revisionists are full of bourgeois ideas,贪生怕死, succumb to the threat of imperialism, have two personalities, and measure others by themselves. Of course, they stubbornly do not believe in the existence of such countless most noble and most outstanding advanced and heroic figures in our era, and spout nonsense that people always have shortcomings and that there is always a struggle between light and darkness hidden in the depths of people's hearts. This is the so-called "inner complexity," this is the so-called "dual personality." If an artistic image of a perfect character is created, it is not real. Precisely because their own hearts are dark, they see everyone as dark,猥琐, and卑劣. The brilliant heroic figures of our era are forever incomprehensible to modern revisionists, and they are also unwilling to understand them.

    The glorious task of us literary and artistic workers is to sing praises of these heroic figures who are promoting the progress of our society with full of political enthusiasm, and to shape the brilliant images of these heroic figures in the best way possible through various means. As an actor, it is not enough to have enthusiasm. What is more important is how to correctly understand the thoughts and feelings of advanced figures, and how to correctly express the noble qualities of advanced figures. The key lies in ideological transformation and establishing a proletarian worldview. My two different experiences of heroic figures in the two performances of "Jin Dalei" fully illustrate this problem.

    Modern revisionists slander our Party's major policy of putting literary and artistic workers into the heat of life and struggle, and thoroughly transforming their worldview through labor鍛煉, spouting nonsense that it is "蹧蹋 artistic talents." From my own experience, none of us Shanghai Opera actors will forget the Shanghai Opera before liberation. Due to the bad influence of imperialist cultural aggression and bourgeois ideas, the plays that appeared on our stage were mostly decadent plays such as "荡妇怨" and "妾无罪," which were full of dim, gloomy, negative, and颓废 ideological emotions. That kind of bad influence on our actors was 糟蹋 talents.

    After liberation, the Party rescued Shanghai Opera from the end of its rope, giving it a new life. For eleven years, under the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the socialist cause, and under the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, plays reflecting the current socialist revolution and socialist construction and revolutionary history have been created and performed one after another. "罗汉钱," "星星之火," "母亲," "黄浦怒潮," "史红梅," and the recent "Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky," etc. The creation and performance of these plays have further promoted the formation and development of the new style of Shanghai Opera art. Our actors have also improved their thinking in the process of going deep into life, labor鍛煉, and striving to create advanced character images. All this proves that it is the old capitalist society that 蹧蹋 talents, and the new socialist society is precisely cultivating talents.

    We can achieve success in our work and make progress in our thinking precisely because of the Party's cultivation of us over the years. It is the result of the Party guiding us to go deep into life and transform our thinking. The problem now is that we are not closely enough integrated with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and our ideological transformation is not deep enough. I would like to give another small example from the Fujian front to illustrate this point and end my short essay.

    Once, we went to an island on the front line to perform. It was raining heavily. Some people were wearing raincoats, and some were not. The comrades who were wearing raincoats felt uneasy when they saw others getting soaked like落汤鸡. They wanted to take off their raincoats and carry forward友爱, but they were afraid of getting wet themselves. At this moment, the首长 who came to greet us on the island immediately took off his raincoat and put it on our comrades when he saw that some of us were getting rained on. The comrades who received the warmth brought by the raincoat and the comrades who were originally wearing raincoats were all very moved and received the most profound class education.

    Although it seems like a small matter, I deeply feel that in front of advanced figures, our style seems so low, and our thinking is not high enough. In the past few years, under the Party's constant education, we literary and artistic workers have also been gradually progressing, but compared with the noble qualities of the 战士 on the front line who leave the difficulties to themselves and give the convenience to others, our progress is so slow. This makes me more deeply realize that going deep into life and transforming our thinking is a long-term and arduous struggle, but it is also a very necessary struggle.

    Having participated in this 文代大会, our direction and road are clearer. We must respond to the call of the conference, hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stand in the forefront of opposing imperialism and opposing modern revisionism, resolutely implement the direction of literary and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers wholeheartedly, go to the heat of struggle, thoroughly transform ourselves, and contribute all our strength to socialist construction and the three red flags with the spirit of卧薪尝胆 and hard work.

    戏剧工作者一定要和工农兵密切结合	丁是娥
    几年来，我们在党的领导下，在贯彻毛主席文艺方向和百花齐放，百家争鸣，推陈出新的方针上取得了很大成绩。就拿我们上海市人民沪剧团来说，通过下厂、下乡、下部队演出，参加劳动和工农兵同生活，思想感情和世界观都开始起了变化。例如去年12月我们剧团到福建前线慰问演出，解放军同志的那种共产主义的高贵品质深深地教育了我们。
    记得那正是1959年除夕，我和一位乐师到最前沿岗哨那里去进行慰问演唱。我们看到一位解放军战士放哨的地方，距离敌人阵地只有几千米，白天用望远镜就可以看到敌人的胸章。我上前去握住他那被海风吹得冰冷的手，说：“同志，你辛苦了！”他立刻回答：“为人民服务！”这简短的五个字，我听过千百次，但现在听来却感到特别亲切、有力。我当时激动得马上要唱一段向这个哨兵同志表示我的由衷的敬意。但指导员委婉地阻止我，说：“这里离敌人比较近，为了安全就免了吧。”我坚决说：“没关系，战士长年累月守在这里都不怕，我怕什么！”我即兴地编了几句唱词，轻声地唱起来：“乘东风，舞红旗，欢度1960年，向英雄们拜个年……”没等我唱完，那位哨兵同志就握紧冲锋枪，面对敌占岛，庄严地说：“亲人们，告诉祖国人民，安安心心地建设社会主义，祖国大门有我们把守！”
    面对着这样一个钢铁的人，促使我考虑许多平常不去深思的问题。
    我首先想到这是一个什么环境。几千米以外就是敌占岛，我们的哨兵同志一天二十四小时，目不转睛地警戒着，不许帝国主义和他的帮凶越过雷池一步！今天是除夕，全国六亿多人民都在欢庆佳节，而前沿的战士却处在“一级备战”的紧张状态中看守着祖国的大门。要不是他们的艰苦的劳动和全心全意为人民服务的精神，大后方六亿多人民怎么能在和平环境中欢度佳节，又怎么能争取到时间全力以赴地和平建设社会主义？只有置身在这具体情境中，我才更具体更深切地体会到战争威胁的客观存在，帝国主义的侵略就在眼前！
    现代修正主义者胡说什么战争的危机已经消失，拼命鼓吹两大阵营之间的“积极共处”，这完全是睁着眼睛说瞎话！他们妄想以此来瓦解社会主义阵营，麻痹全世界人民反对帝国主义的斗争意志，借以达到保护资本主义世界的目的。他们的谰言是蒙蔽不了全世界人民的眼睛的。我们文艺工作者，必须挥起我们的文艺武器，揭穿现代修正主义者的谎言，并且采用各种各样的方法向帝国主义展开斗争。
    其次我想到：党是经常谆谆教导我们要全心全意为人民服务的，可是我究竟为人民作了多少工作呢？过去我片面地认为文艺为工农兵服务，深入工农兵生活，只是下去演出，推动推动生产，鼓鼓群众干劲，却忽视了最根本的一点，那就是和工农兵打成一片，向工农兵学习，在他们感染之下加紧自我改造。在这基础上，才能产生热爱工农兵，表现工农兵的热情，也只有这样，才能把英雄人物的形象，更真实更集中地树立起来。我才体会到党为什么要我们到生活中去，到火热的斗争中去的英明伟大的方针。
    今年6月，在反对美帝国主义宣传周中，我们剧团重演了《金黛莱》。这个戏描写中朝儿女并肩抗击共同的敌人——美帝国主义，我扮演剧中一个为营救中国人民志愿军奋不顾身的朝鲜妇女金黛莱。1953年，我们剧团赴朝慰问演出归来时就创作并演出了这个戏。我在朝鲜逗留的日子里，有意识地去观察了朝鲜劳动妇女的生活，想尽办法和她们接近，熟悉她们，了解她们，体会她们的思想感情。这给我后来的演出带来很大好处。但在排演时，我仍然难于充分表现出金黛莱这一角色的英雄性格。在当时演出后一位志愿军同志曾对我提出尖锐的批评说：“在送夫上前线的一场戏中你为什么要哭哭啼啼呢？我们在朝鲜就从来没有看见过这样的妇女。”我为什么会这样表演呢？主要由于自己对帝国主义的仇恨远不如朝鲜妇女那样强烈和深刻，也就是说，我和脚色之间还有着距离。今年重演这个戏，由于党的教育，经过一系列的政治运动以及学习了《一切反动派都是纸老虎》，特别是通过海防前线的慰问，我懂得了毛主席关于战争与和平的学说，我了解了帝国主义欺软怕硬的本质，我弄清了只有通过斗争才能获得真正和平的道理，特别是我逐渐理解了英雄人物的英雄性格是如何形成的，他们的伟大的精神力量是从何而来的，我对金黛莱这个脚色的处理就有很大不同了。我体会为了保卫祖国，只有起来作坚决的斗争，只有斗争才能保卫解放了的幸福生活。因此，送丈夫上前线，她只能是满怀信心，无限希望，而不会哭哭啼啼。
    在另一个根据上海一个民办小学教师吴佩芳坚持党的教育方针白手起家，办好民校的先进事迹创作的《鸡毛飞上天》里，我在创造剧中林佩芬（即吴佩芳）这个脚色时，也遇到了类似的情况。第三场戏写这个家庭妇女出身的民办小学教师上第一课，由于她缺乏经验，一节课只上了一半就教不下去了，教室秩序也很乱。我起初演这一段戏时，是流着眼泪对支部书记说：“四十分钟一节课，我只上了二十分钟就无啥讲了呀！”说这句话时带着恨自己没本事的委屈情绪，表现了个人得失的考虑。每次演到这里，观众总是哄堂笑声，笑我那种可怜巴巴的尴尬样子。我很着急，不知应该怎样表演才好。后来去请教那位吴佩芳老师，问她当时遇到这种困难是怎样想的。她回答说：“我当时只想到没有完成党交给我的任务，感到难过。”这一句简单而意味深长的回答，对我的教育和启发实在太大了。我深深体会到：先进人物之所以先进，主要在于他们处处考虑的不是个人得失，而是党的事业和集体的利益。
    现代修正主义者满脑子资产阶级思想，贪生怕死，屈服于帝国主义的威胁，两重人格，以己度人，当然硬是不相信我们时代的这种难以胜数的最崇高、最优秀的先进人物和英雄人物的存在，而胡说什么人总是有缺点的，人的心灵深处总隐藏着光明和黑暗的斗争。这就是所谓“内心的复杂性”，这就是所谓“双重人格”。如果塑造了完美无疵的人物的艺术形象，那就不真实。正因为他们自己的心灵是阴暗的，他们才把所有的人都看成是阴暗的、猥琐的、卑劣的。我们时代的光辉灿烂的英雄人物，是现代修正主义者永远不能理解的，也是他们不愿去理解的。
    我们文艺工作者的光荣任务就是：要充满政治热情来歌颂这些推动我们社会前进的英雄人物，通过各种方式把这些英雄人物的光辉形象最好地塑造出来。作为一个演员来讲，光有热情还是不够的，更重要的是怎样正确理解先进人物的思想感情，怎样正确地表现先进人物的高贵品质，关键在于思想改造，树立无产阶级的世界观。我在《金黛莱》两次演出中对英雄人物的两种不同的体会，就充分说明了这个问题。
    现代修正主义者对我们党把文艺工作者投入火热的生活和斗争，通过劳动锻炼，彻底改造世界观的重大政策横加诬蔑，胡说什么是“蹧蹋艺术人材”。从我切身的经历来说，我们沪剧演员谁也不会忘记解放前的沪剧，由于帝国主义文化侵略和资产阶级思想的坏影响，在我们舞台上出现的大都是《荡妇怨》、《妾无罪》这一类萎靡不振的剧目，充满了暗淡、阴沉、消极、颓废的思想情绪，给我们演员的那种坏影响，才是糟蹋人材呢。
    解放后，党把沪剧从穷途末路中拯救了出来，使沪剧得到了新生。十一年来，在为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务的方向下，在百花齐放、推陈出新的方针下，陆续创作和演出了反映当前社会主义革命和社会主义建设以及革命历史的剧目。《罗汉钱》、《星星之火》、《母亲》、《黄浦怒潮》、《史红梅》，以及最近的《鸡毛飞上天》等等。这些剧目的创作和演出，进一步推动了沪剧艺术新风格的形成和发展。我们演员也在深入生活，劳动锻炼，努力创造先进人物形象的过程中提高了自己的思想。这一切都证明，蹧蹋人材的是资本主义旧社会，社会主义的新社会正是培植人材。
    我们能在工作中获得成绩，在思想上获得进步，正是党这些年来对我们的培养。正是党引导我们深入生活，改造思想的结果，现在的问题是我们与工农兵结合得还不够紧，思想改造还不够深，我想再举一个在福建前线的小例子说明这个问题，来结束我的短文。
    有一次，我们到前沿一个岛上去演出，天下着倾盆大雨，有人穿着雨衣，有人没有穿。穿着雨衣的同志，有的看着别人淋得像落汤鸡，心里很不安，很想脱下雨衣发扬友爱，但又怕自己淋湿。正在这时，岛上来迎接我们的首长，一看见我们有人淋着雨，立刻脱下身上的雨衣，披在我们同志的身上。接受雨衣带来温暖的同志和原来穿着雨衣的同志，都十分感动，受到了一次最深切的阶级教育。
    虽然看起来这是件小事情，但我深深感到：在先进人物的面前，我们的风格显得多么低，我们的思想还不够高。几年来，在党的不断教育下，我们文艺工作者也都是逐渐在进步的，但和前线战士们那种把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人的高贵品质相比，我们的进步是多么缓慢啊。这使我更深切地体会到：深入生活、改造思想是长期的、艰苦的斗争，但也是十分必要的斗争。
    参加了这次文代大会，我们的方向道路更明确了。我们一定响应大会的号召，高高举起毛泽东思想的红旗，坚决站到反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的最前列来，坚决贯彻文艺为工农兵服务的方向，全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，彻底改造自己，以卧薪尝胆的精神，艰苦奋斗，为社会主义建设、为三面红旗贡献出自己的一切力量。
