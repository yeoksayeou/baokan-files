    The Tai Zi River surged, and some villages in the suburbs of Liaoyang City were surrounded by floods. A unit of the People's Liberation Army was ordered to come here to fight the flood and provide disaster relief. They performed many moving deeds.
    
    "We are the People's Liberation Army"
    
    On the morning of August 5th, the shock troops of the 3rd Company of a certain unit were wading through chest-deep water, rushing towards Shangwang Village. At this time, an old man in his fifties, carrying a small bag, was slowly groping his way from the opposite side. As he walked, he suddenly fell into a large puddle, struggling several times without surfacing. At this critical moment, Deputy Platoon Leader Xu Hegou, Squad Leader Qi Yongyou, and soldier Shen Xuetian dashed over like arrows, nimbly pulling the old man up and carrying him all the way to the other side. The old man had tears of gratitude in his eyes, saying, "Thank you! I would have lost my life without you! Comrades, what are your names?" The three comrades replied in unison, "Old man, we are the People's Liberation Army. You should rest well. We still have a mission!" With that, they turned around and jumped back into the flood...
    
    Speed Up
    
    Chen Bangshun, the squad leader of the 6th Squad of a certain company, led several soldiers in a rubber boat to Daoxitun. At this time, three women in labor and several old women were waiting for them. The 6th squad leader took the soldiers and carried them onto the boat one by one. The boat was small and difficult to row with so many people, so the soldiers got into the water and pushed the boat forward slowly. However, the longer the boat stayed in the water, the more pain the women in labor would suffer. The 6th squad leader thought: We must find a way to speed up. He took the rope from the bow of the boat, wrapped it around his waist, and pulled the boat with all his strength. Sometimes he fell into the pits, but he got up and continued to pull until he dragged the boat to the shore.
    
    Seizing Grain at Longmen
    
    The flood surrounded Dasha Ridge. After a day of rescue, all the residents were safe, but hundreds of thousands of kilograms of grain were still piled up in the warehouse. On the evening of August 5th, after receiving the order to rescue the grain, a certain unit immediately marched twenty li at high speed to Shaling and began to transport it. Without vehicles or boats, everyone carried it on their shoulders. Some of the bags were damaged, so they used handkerchiefs to plug the holes and clothes to wrap them. Everyone put forward the slogans of "Seizing grain at Longmen, be quick and thorough" and "Cherish grain, don't drop a single grain." After eight hours of hard work, they rescued all 160,000 kilograms of grain from the warehouse.

    在抗洪救灾中的解放军
    太子河水猛涨，辽阳市郊区部分村庄被洪水围困，人民解放军某部奉命来到这里，抗洪救灾。他们作出了许多动人的事迹。
    “我们是人民解放军”
    八月五日清晨，某部三连的突击队员正趟着齐胸深的水向上王家急步前进。这时候，一位五十多岁的老大爷背着一个小包，从对面慢慢摸索着走来。走着走着，忽然掉到大泡子里去了，几次挣扎，也没有露出头来。就在这危急关头，副排长徐禾苟、班长齐永有、战士申学田三同志就像离弦的箭似的钻了过去，敏捷地把老大爷架起来一直送到对岸。老大爷眼里挂着感激的泪花，说：“谢谢你们！没有你们我这条命就完了！同志，你们都贵姓？”三个同志齐声回答：“老大爷，我们是人民解放军，您好好休息一下吧，我们还有任务！”说罢，掉头又跳进洪水……。
    加快速度
    某连六班长陈邦顺，领几个战士驾着一只胶皮船来到道西屯。这时，正有三个产妇和几个老太太在等着他们，六班长就带着战士把她们一个一个背上船。船小人多划不动，战士们就下水推船慢慢地前进。可是，船在水里多呆一分钟，产妇们就要多痛苦一分钟。六班长心里想：应该想办法加快速度。他把船头的绳子拿过来缠在自己腰上，用尽力气拖着船走，有时候摔倒了掉到坑里，爬起来又拖，一直把船拖到岸边。
    龙门夺粮
    洪水包围了大沙岭，经过一天抢救，居民全部脱险，但是十几万斤粮食还堆在仓库里。八月五日晚上，某部接到抢救粮食的命令后，当即快速行军二十里，赶到沙岭，进行抢运。没有车，没有船，大家就用肩扛，有的袋子坏了，就用手帕堵，用衣服包。大家提出：“龙门夺粮，要快要光”，“爱护粮食、不掉一粒”的口号。大家苦战八个小时，就将仓库里十六万斤粮食全部抢运出来了。
