    Growing Through Practical Work and Hard Work
    ——A Record of the Shashi Tire Factory's Development from a Repair Group	 Our Hubei Correspondent
    The Shashi Tire Factory in Hubei Province was developed two years ago from a "Rubber Repair Group" established by three demobilized soldiers, Qiu Yulong, Shen Mingcai, and Liu Shusheng. At the time, they only had a sledgehammer, two knives, a table, a stove, and seventy-odd yuan worth of discarded rubber tires. However, under the leadership of Communist Party member Qiu Yulong, they displayed the spirit of "poor but ambitious," relied on their own efforts, and ran the factory thriftily, enabling it to develop rapidly. Currently, the factory has accumulated more than 470,000 yuan in capital for the state, possesses thirty-two pieces of equipment, and has achieved mechanization or semi-mechanization in over 90% of its operations. It can produce more than 2,000 meters of transmission belts, over a hundred high-pressure water pipes, and dozens of Hercules tires daily, becoming a main force in Hubei's rubber industry.

      Three "Cobblers" Making Revolution
    How did this factory develop? This needs to be told from the beginning. After Qiu Yulong and the other two were demobilized, they initially worked at the Shashi Martyrs' Families Shoe Factory. Qiu Yulong often saw the factory discarding damaged scrap rubber tires when making tire-soled shoes, and felt it was a great pity. They picked up those scrap tires and weighed them, totaling over three hundred pounds. They thought: How can we repair and utilize these scrap tires? During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the factory lacked rubber tires and sent people to Hankou and Changsha, but couldn't buy any. Qiu Yulong remembered seeing people hot-patching rubber tires at the Hankou Railway Station and borrowed some rubber, moved a stove, and tried to repair them. He put the patched rubber shoe soles into a steamer, but they became like foam, with many holes. He then clamped them with wooden boards and steamed them again, resulting in a smooth surface with no visible traces of repair. Therefore, the factory decided to have him, Shen Mingcai, and Liu Shusheng specialize in repairing rubber tires, and put up a sign outside the factory stating "Attached Rubber Repair Group." In one week, they used the pile of scrap tires worth only seventy-odd yuan to make shoe soles and flatbed cart tires worth over 1,400 yuan. The factory then moved them to the street to set up independently, and they hung up the sign "Attached Repair Factory of Martyrs' Families Shoe Factory." Many units cleaned out some waste car tires and asked them to process them into flatbed cart tires. Their business suddenly became very busy.

    Qiu Yulong was a renowned shoe-making expert, averaging 108 yuan in piece-rate wages per month. He thought: The factory is just starting, with only a thousand-odd yuan in capital. If I continue to take such a high salary, the money will be spent in a few days, and how will the factory develop? Therefore, he voluntarily proposed to reduce his salary to fifty-eight yuan. Shen Mingcai and Liu Shusheng discussed it and said: "The Party sent the three of us to run the factory, and everyone has a responsibility." They also voluntarily reduced their salaries from over fifty and sixty yuan to forty yuan respectively. The masses wrote big-character posters praising their spirit of selflessness for the public good, and many people helped them work on Sundays without rest or pay.

        At the Most Critical Juncture
    More than a month later, there weren't many rubber products left in the city to be processed and repaired, and they hadn't received any work for three consecutive days. Should they go back to the factory to make shoes as before, or continue to work? And how to continue? Just then, the broken transmission belt on the shoe factory's polishing machine broke again, making it impossible to repair. The shoe factory's production was about to be affected.

    Qiu Yulong ran to the city's industrial equipment company to ask, and also telegraphed to Hankou, but couldn't buy any transmission belts. Why was there such a shortage? He asked Old Yu of the industrial equipment company, and Old Yu said: "Only Shanghai, Tianjin, and Shenyang produce them nationwide. Now it's the Great Leap Forward, and everyone needs them. How can there not be a shortage?" He asked Old Yu for a section of the belt, disassembled it, and saw that it was canvas glued with rubber. He thought: If our factory can manufacture them, wouldn't that help the country overcome some difficulties? He immediately bought a meter of canvas to experiment with.

    Experimenting with transmission belts was much more difficult than doing repairs. He experimented four times in a row, but the rubber and canvas couldn't bond tightly together. Others suggested he clamp the canvas belt with long splints and heat it. He found splints, brushed on the glue, and put them in the steamer for half an hour. When he opened the splints, the glue had all run off, leaving only two layers of cloth. He didn't lose heart and continued to experiment. He found two old iron plates to clamp. Unexpectedly, the belt stuck to the iron plates. It took a lot of effort to tear it apart. But the rubber and canvas were very tightly bonded, impossible to grind off or tear apart. He quickly sanded the iron plates smooth, applied oil, and then clamped them and steamed them again. A beautiful and durable transmission belt was finally successfully tested.

    The next day, Qiu Yulong put the homemade transmission belt on the polishing machine, and the machine immediately started running, turning very smoothly. So, they removed the words "Repair" from the factory name and established the Shashi First Rubber Factory.

     From a Photo to Twenty-Seven Machines
    After the transmission belt was successfully trial-produced, Shandong, Hebei, and Wuhan sent people to order in large quantities, but due to manual operation, they could only produce thirty meters a day, which was far from meeting the requirements of the Great Leap Forward. What to do? They sent people to Shanghai to buy a vulcanizing machine, but couldn't buy one, and only brought back a photo of a vulcanizing machine. Qiu Yulong immediately took the photo to ask the city's machinery factory to manufacture it. They said: "Making a machine requires drawings. Just a photo is not enough." They requested approval from the Party branch to buy some hand drills, bench vices, and other tools, and decided to build it themselves. The purchased I-beams were more than a meter long and weighed more than three hundred pounds. Without machine tools for processing, they carried them together and used hand drills to make holes. The machine in the photo had a single lead screw, but their I-beams were too long and had to be cut into two sections. Without such a large band saw, they devised a way to convert it into a double lead screw, which not only could cut I-beams but also increase production efficiency by a factor of two… Relying on a photo, working hard and cleverly, they finally manufactured a vulcanizing machine, and production immediately increased from thirty meters to ninety-six meters per day.

    The successful manufacturing of the first machine greatly increased everyone's confidence, and the ideas became broader. They saw a machine for making noodles on the street, and found a way to buy one and convert it into a belt forming machine. Inspired by beekeepers taking honey on the farm, they used a gasoline drum and some iron sheets to make a glue mixing machine. In just a few months, they made twenty-seven machines, which increased the daily output of transmission belts from more than three hundred meters to more than six hundred meters.

    Last summer, the city asked them to double their production. How to double it? Qiu Yulong and everyone studied it again and again, believing that the key was the vulcanizing machine. At this time, he happened to visit the city and saw the double-layer weaving method, and immediately thought that his factory could also use double-layer pressing of the rubber. After returning and trying it, the vulcanization time was shortened by half. He then found a way to increase the temperature, and the vulcanization time was shortened by another third. Daily production capacity was then increased to more than 1,600 meters, completing the doubling plan ahead of schedule. Since then, their production has officially been included in the national production plan.

        Marching Towards Automation
    Production developed so quickly, but the glue application process was still manual. Each time for glue application, they had to go to the large square four or five li away, stretch the canvas more than one hundred meters, and then apply the glue back and forth, twelve coats on the front and twelve coats on the back. Each person had to run back and forth eight or nine li a day. In case of rain and snow, they had to stop work.

    Qiu Yulong and several workers went to other places to "learn from experience." In Wuhan, they saw the Daqiao Rubber Factory using a crude glue coating machine for applying glue to raincoat cloth, which only required four coats on both sides manually. In Shanghai, they saw a foreign glue coating machine that didn't require any manual labor at all, and only applied two coats of glue. After inquiring, each machine cost 130,000 yuan, and they weren't even taking orders. In the spring, the city launched a technical innovation campaign to attack backward manual operations. Under the leadership of Qiu Yulong, everyone thought of using a crude oven to replace the steam boiler, and used a scrapped tire repair machine frame to replace the glue coating frame. At the same time, they also devised a way to create counter rotating rollers and a glue trough, so that the canvas would pass through there and have glue applied to both sides. They spent a total of more than seven thousand yuan to make an automated combined glue coating machine. The daily output of transmission belts immediately jumped to 2,600 meters, reaching a maximum of 3,600 meters, and the number of workers was reduced by two-thirds. Because the machine tensioned the canvas tightly, it also saved sixty square meters of canvas for every thousand meters of belt, and the quality fully met national requirements. They completed the annual production plan seven months ahead of schedule. Their factory was officially renamed "Shashi Tire Factory."

    Now, they are attacking the material barrier, to enable them to produce the more than twenty kinds of accessories they need themselves, and gradually build the factory into a small-scale rubber joint enterprise.

    Recently, on the occasion of the Shashi Tire Factory's second anniversary, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a congratulatory telegram, giving the factory a high evaluation, calling it a golden phoenix that flew out of a chicken coop, and calling the factory's director Qiu Yulong "Wang Guofan of the industrial front."

    在实干苦干中成长
    ——记从修配组发展起来的沙市轮胎厂	本报驻湖北记者
    湖北省沙市轮胎厂是两年前由丘玉龙和沈明才、刘树生三个复员军人办的“橡胶修配组”发展起来的。当时，只有一把鎯头、两把刀、一张桌子、一口灶和价值七十多元的废胶胎，然而大家在共产党员丘玉龙的带动下，发挥“穷棒子”精神，自力更生，勤俭办厂，使这个厂迅速发展了起来。目前，这个厂已为国家积累了四十七万多元资金，已拥有三十二台设备，90％以上的操作都实现了机械化半机械化，每天能生产两千多米传动带、百多根高压水管和数十只力士轮胎，成了湖北橡胶工业中的一支主力军。
      三个“皮匠”闹革命
    这个厂是怎样发展起来的呢？这要从头说起。丘玉龙等三人复员回来以后，最初都在沙市烈军属制鞋厂做工。丘玉龙经常看见厂里制作车胎鞋底时把一些破损了的废胶胎扔掉，心里怪可惜的。他们把那些废胶胎拾在一起，称了称，足有三百来斤。他们就想：怎样才能把这些废胶胎修补起来，加以利用。1958年大跃进，厂里缺胶胎，派人去汉口、长沙跑了一大圈，都买不到。丘玉龙想起他曾经在汉口车站看见别人热补胶胎的事，便借了点橡胶，搬了口锅灶，试着修补。他将补上胶的破鞋底放进甑里去蒸，结果蒸得跟泡沫一样，出现了很多蜂窝。他又用木板夹住再蒸，结果表面很光滑，看不出修补的痕迹来。厂里于是决定他和沈明才、刘树生专门负责修补胶胎，并在厂外贴了个“附设橡胶修配组”的条子。他们在一个星期里，就利用厂里那堆只值七十多元的废胶胎，做成了价值一千四百多元的鞋底和板车带。厂里又将他们迁到大街上独立门户，挂上了“烈军属制鞋厂附属修配厂”的牌子。许多单位都把一些废汽车胎清理出来，请他们给加工成板车带。他们的生意突然繁忙了起来。
    丘玉龙是著名的制鞋能手，每月平均可以拿到一百零八元计件工资。他想：工厂才开始创业，只有千把元资金，如果还像过去拿那么高的工资，要不了几天就把钱花光了，厂子怎么发展？于是主动提出把工资降低到五十八元，沈明才、刘树生两人一商量：“厂子是党派我们三人来办的，大家都有责任。”也分别把工资由五十多、六十多元主动降为四十元。群众纷纷写大字报赞扬他们这种舍己为公的精神，许多人星期天不休息、不要代价地来帮助他们干活。
        在最紧要的关头上
    一个多月以后，市里能加工修配的橡胶制品不多了，他们一连三天没有接到活。是回厂照旧做鞋呢，还是继续干下去？又怎么干？正在这时，偏又遇上鞋厂磨光机上的破传动带又断了，实在不能再补，眼看鞋厂的生产也要受到影响。
    丘玉龙跑到市工业器材公司去问，又打电报去汉口，都没有买到传动带。为什么这样缺呢？他问工业器材公司的老余，老余说：“全国就只有上海、天津、沈阳三家生产。如今大跃进，都要用它。还能不缺？”他向老余要了一节头子拆开来看了看，是帆布与橡胶粘合起来的。他想：要是我们厂里能制造，岂不是可以帮助国家克服一些困难？他马上买回一米帆布进行试验。
    试验传动带比搞修配要困难得多了。他接连试验了四次，胶和帆布都不能紧密粘合在一起。别人建议他将帆布胶带用长夹板夹住加热。他找来夹板，刷好胶浆，送进甑里蒸了半小时，打开夹板一看，胶都流跑了，只剩下两层布片。他没有灰心，继续试验。又找来两块旧铁板来夹。不料胶带又和铁板粘在一起了，费了好大劲才撕开。可是胶和帆布却粘合得非常紧密，磨不脱，撕不开。他连忙用砂石把铁板打磨光，涂上油，再夹住蒸。一条漂亮牢实的传动带终于试验成功了。
    第二天，丘玉龙就把自制的传动带套上磨光机，机器马上开动起来，转得满欢。于是，他们又抹去了厂名上的“修配”二字，成立了沙市第一橡胶厂。
     从一张照片到二十七台机器
    传动带试制成功以后，山东、河北和武汉都派专人来大批订货，而他们由于手工操作，一天只能生产三十米，远远不能适应大跃进的要求。怎么办呢？他们派人去上海买硫化机，没买到，只带回来一张硫化机的照片。丘玉龙立即拿着照片去请市里机械厂制造。人家说：“做机器得有图纸，光凭张照片，做不出来。”他们请示支部批准，买了一些手摇钻、台钳等工具，决定自己造。买回的工字钢有一米多长，三百多斤重，没有机床加工，他们就几个人扛着用手摇钻打眼。照片上的机器是单丝杠的，他们的工字钢太长，得截成两段，又没有这么大的锯床，他们就设法改为双丝杠的，不但能截工字钢，生产效率还能提高一倍……。他们凭着一张照片，苦干巧干，终于将一台硫化机制造了出来，生产马上由日产三十米提高到九十六米。
    第一台机器制造成功，使大家的信心大大增强，思路越加广阔。他们在街上看见压面条的机器，就设法买回一台改成了胶带成型机；看见农场取蜂蜜，受到了启发，就用一个汽油桶、几张铁片，做成了一台胶浆搅拌机。就这样，几个月的功夫，就制出了二十七台机器，使传动带的日产量猛增到三百多米到六百多米。
    去年夏天，市里要求他们的生产翻一番。怎么翻？丘玉龙和大家一起研究来研究去，认为关键在硫化机上。这时，正好他去市里参观双层织布法，马上联想到自己厂里也能搞双层压胶。回来一试，硫化时间竟缩短了一半。他再设法提高温度，硫化时间又缩短了三分之一。日产能力于是又提高到一千六百多米，提前完成了翻一番的计划。从此他们的生产也正式开始列入了国家生产计划。
        向自动化进军
    生产发展得这样快，可是涂胶工序还是手工操作。每次涂胶，都得到四五里远的大广场上去，将帆布绷开一百多米，然后来回涂，正面十二道，反面十二道，每人每天得往返奔跑八、九里。一遇雨雪天，还得停工。
    丘玉龙和几个工人到外地“取经”，在武汉看见大桥橡胶厂给雨衣布上胶使用一种土涂胶机，只用手工两面涂四道；在上海又见到一种洋涂胶机，完全不用手工，还只涂两道胶。一打听，每台得十三万元，人家还不接订货。春天，全市开展技术革新运动，猛攻落后的手工操作。大家在丘玉龙主持下，想法用土烘炉代替蒸汽锅炉，用废旧的补胎机架子代替涂胶支架，同时还想法搞了对滚筒和胶槽，使帆布穿过这里就两面涂上了胶，他们总共花了七千多元就制成了一台自动化的联合涂胶机。传动带的日产量马上跃到两千六百米，最高达到三千六百米，工人还减了三分之二。由于机器绷得紧，每一千米胶带还能节约六十平方米帆布，而质量完全符合国家要求。他们提前七个月完成了全年的生产计划。他们的工厂又正式更名为“沙市轮胎厂”。
    现在，他们正在猛攻材料关，要使他们需用的二十多种附料都能自己生产，把工厂逐步建成一个小型橡胶联合企业。
          ×　×　×　×
    最近，在沙市轮胎厂建厂两周年的时候，中共湖北省委特发来贺电，给予这个厂很高的评价，称这个厂是鸡窝里飞出的金凤凰，称这个厂的厂长丘玉龙是“工业战线上的王国藩”。
