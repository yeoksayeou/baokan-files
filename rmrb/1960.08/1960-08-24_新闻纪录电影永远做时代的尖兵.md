	The film industry of New China began with newsreel films. As early as the autumn of 1938, the Yan'an Film Group was established under the instruction of the Party Central Committee. At that time, the entire film group had only six people and two cameras. The comrades of the film group carried forward the spirit of hard struggle of the revolutionary ranks and, under extremely difficult conditions, filmed "Yan'an and the Eighth Route Army," "Nanniwan," and other films, recording several important activities of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. These materials have become valuable historical documents. The films shot at that time were the first films in Chinese history to feature workers, peasants, and soldiers as the masters, pioneering a new style of proletarian newsreel film and a revolutionary path, laying a good foundation for the development of China's proletarian film industry.

	In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the newsreel film industry remained at the forefront of the film industry. Before 1953, only the Central Newsreel Film Studio mainly produced newsreels. After 1958, thirty-three film studios were established across the country, including twenty-two specializing in newsreels and science and education films. The number of newsreel film practitioners grew to more than two thousand. The newsreels produced in 1958 and 1959 were equivalent to the total production of newsreels from 1949 to 1957. In 1958 alone, the number of copies of newsreels issued accounted for 32% of the total length of all copies issued, accounting for one-third of the total number of films of all types in the country.

	Over the past ten years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, we have produced many excellent films, such as "Ode to Heroes," "Celebrating Ten Years," "Heroes Conquer the Great Northern Wilderness," "The Tenth Spring," "A Million Serfs Stand Up," "Shanghai Heroic Symphony," "Asian Storm," etc., which have been warmly welcomed by audiences both at home and abroad.

	Newsreel films, as part of the superstructure, closely cooperate with the economic base and closely serve proletarian politics. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages, we recorded and publicized the great victories of the Party during the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. We have strived to publicize the Party's general line and a series of guidelines and policies. We enthusiastically praised the wise, great, and correct Party, praised our hardworking, brave, and revolutionary Chinese people, praised the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system, and praised the increasingly prosperous and powerful image of our great motherland. In addition, in international propaganda, we have also cooperated with the international struggle situation of various periods, and promoted the Party's basic views on the international situation through films. The films we have produced have increasingly played a powerful role on the Party's ideological front.

	In reflecting the themes of revolutionary war, first of all, we recorded the people's revolutionary war waged by the Chinese people to overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, we filmed the revolutionary war waged by the Chinese people to seize power with abundant revolutionary enthusiasm and fearlessness of all difficulties, and recorded the historical turning points and great changes of the Chinese revolution. For example, we filmed "Three Years of Liberation War in Northeast China," "A Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze River," "Huaihai Campaign," "Triumphant Songs in the Great Southwest," "Red Flag Sweeping the Northwest Wind," "The Army Marching into Tibet," "Battle of Hainan Island," etc. These films, with their strong political and combat roles, greatly encouraged the revolutionary fighting spirit of the people of the whole country and had a great impact on the masses.

	After the Chinese people overthrew the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries and seized power, they quickly eliminated the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionary army and liberated the coastal islands. At this time, we filmed a series of films to eliminate the Kuomintang remnants and oppose American imperialist aggression, such as "Liberation of Dachen Island," "Liberation - Jiangshan Island," "Severely Punish the Chiang Kai-shek Bandits," etc.

	When our country was still in the early days of its founding, we produced films such as "Strike at the Aggressors" and "Defend World Peace," which demonstrated the basic position of the Chinese people in opposing imperialism and striving for world peace. Subsequently, we filmed a series of films with the theme of exposing, attacking, and isolating American imperialism, such as: "Resist America, Aid Korea," "A True Record of the Crimes of American Imperialist Germ Warfare," "Exhibition of Crimes of American Airdropped Agents," "The Crimes of American Military Reconnaissance Balloons," etc. In these films, we exposed the aggressive nature of American imperialism and accused the American war-mongers of their heinous crimes to the people of the world. In the film "Resist America, Aid Korea," we exposed the essence of American imperialism, which seemed powerful but was actually a weak paper tiger, to the people of the world, proving Chairman Mao's brilliant assertion that "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers"; and praised the deep friendship and lofty internationalist spirit condensed by the Chinese and Korean people with blood and life.

	When imperialism, in order to save its declining fate, ignited the Middle East to invade Lebanon and created a tense situation in the Taiwan Strait, making a serious provocation to our country and the people of the world, we filmed "The Roar of 600 Million People," "Protest Against American Aggression Against Lebanon," "Support Premier Zhou's Statement," "Mobilize to Crush the War Provocations of American Aggressors," and other films, demonstrating the just position of our people and our firm support for the people of the Middle East.

	Recently, American imperialism has undermined the Four-Power Summit Conference, further exposing its aggressive nature; the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging forward; the people's revolutionary struggles in capitalist countries are further developing; the struggles of the people of all countries against imperialist war forces and in defense of world peace are rising; the American imperialist running dogs Syngman Rhee and Menderes have fallen one after another, and Nobusuke Kishi had to announce his resignation in the face of the powerful people's movement. American imperialism has fallen into the quagmire of the people of the world and is in an unprecedentedly isolated position. Under this situation, we have vigorously and continuously reported on the heroic struggles of the people of South Korea, Japan, and Turkey against American imperialism and its running dogs, and produced more than ten films that closely cooperated with the situation, such as "Asian Storm," "The Plague God Reveals Its True Colors," "Ten Thousand Cannons Bomb the 'Plague God'," "Expose the American Paper Tiger," "Anti-American Demonstration," etc., which concentrated on and profoundly exposed the reactionary nature of American imperialism's false peace, real war preparations, false relaxation, and real aggression. This proves Chairman Mao's profound judgment on the situation. Chairman Mao told us: "The life of imperialism will not be long, they have done all the bad things, and the oppressed people of the whole world will never forgive them." The reason why these films can produce a strong combat role is mainly because they fully demonstrate the powerful strength of the people and implement Mao Zedong Thought.

	Since liberation, the face of our country and the spiritual outlook of the people have undergone extremely profound and great changes. The socialist system has been firmly established, a new, independent and complete national economic system is being formed, and the initial foundation for socialist industrialization has been established. On the basis of production development, the people's cultural living standards have also been significantly improved. The Chinese people are striding forward on the road of socialist construction in accordance with their own great will. China's newsreel filmmakers have the responsibility to record these huge changes and achievements in film form, so as to encourage the people to continue to move forward. We have paid attention to filming themes of economic changes since the restoration of the national economy. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, we have paid more attention to fully reflecting the brilliant achievements made on the industrial and agricultural fronts of our country, and we have also paid attention to reflecting the unprecedented prosperity of our country's cultural and educational undertakings with the advent of the economic construction upsurge. Through films, we also praised the great unity of the various ethnic groups in our country under the leadership of the Party.

	In order to truly record the historical face of the great changes in our country, the footprints of China's newsreel filmmakers have spread all over the country. People call newsreel filmmakers "witnesses of the times." Newsreel filmmakers have not failed the Party's education and the people's entrustment. From the Yan'an Film Group to the present, in order to truly record the progress of the motherland, we have firmly stood on the front line of revolutionary struggle.

	In order to record the great revolutionary struggles of our people, newsreel filmmakers have made arduous efforts and even sacrificed their precious lives. In our country's revolutionary struggle, some of our comrades have sacrificed themselves in combat posts and dedicated their most valuable lives to the newsreel film industry. In the Liaoshen Campaign of the 1948 filming of "Three Years of Liberation War in Northeast China," cameramen Zhang Shaoke, Wang Jing'an, and Yang Yinxuan shed their last drop of blood on the battlefield; in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, cameramen Yang Xuzhong and Gao Qingsheng heroically sacrificed themselves on the Korean battlefield; in the filming of "The Army Marching into Tibet," cameraman Guan Zhijian dedicated his youthful life on the Tibetan Plateau; cameraman Hao Fengge was brutally murdered by the enemy for the cause of Asian-African peace. Their spirit of heroic sacrifice for China's newsreel film will always be a model for us to learn from.

	In the era of socialist revolution and socialist construction, we inherited the fighting spirit of the martyrs and went to factories, mines, construction sites, rural areas, deep mountains, and deserts to struggle and live with the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the posture of ordinary laborers, carrying forward the style of hard struggle and going deep into reality. The purpose is to truly and accurately record the face of the great changes of the times.

	In the spring of 1959, the upper-level reactionary clique in Tibet launched a counter-revolutionary rebellion. The news cameramen working in Tibet immediately devoted themselves to filming films exposing the crimes of the traitors. When the upper-level reactionaries forced and coerced the masses to gather and march, our cameramen, in order to truly record the evidence of the traitors' crimes, bravely and calmly went deep into the places where the rebels gathered and marched, regardless of the danger to their lives, to carry out filming work. When the rebels blocked the roads and controlled the commanding heights of Lhasa, our cameramen took armored vehicles to film the rebels building fortifications and deployments, recording the criminal actions of the traitors.

	In order to record the heroic feat of the Chinese women's mountaineering team climbing the summit of "Father of Ice Mountains" - Muztagh Ata and creating a world women's mountaineering record, our young cameraman Comrade Shen Jie overcame numerous difficulties and gloriously completed the task given by the Party. When Comrade Shen Jie climbed to 7,200 meters, his hands and feet were frozen, so he had to have his ten toes and two finger joints amputated. Comrade Shen Jie's abundant revolutionary optimism not only enabled him to endure the physiological pain and persevere in exercising, but now he has finally returned to our photography team and has taken up the camera again to join the new battle.

	When filming the film of Chinese mountaineers climbing Mount Everest from the north slope this year, our cameramen Comrades Mou Sen and Wang Ximao, in order to faithfully reflect this great event, insisted on filming work in the cold climate, high altitude hypoxia, and wind force of up to level 12, and excellently completed the task. In the process of mountaineering, in order to choose the shooting angle, they traveled back and forth in the ice and snow. Although altitude sickness had made them dizzy and vomiting, and their pulse beat one hundred and sixty or seventy times per minute, they still insisted on working. When Comrade Wang Ximao climbed to an altitude of 6,800 meters above sea level, all ten of his toes were frostbitten. In order to strive to shoot more materials, he still insisted on climbing to an altitude of 7,400 meters above sea level to carry out filming work. Comrade Mou Sen lived on the iceberg at an altitude of 6,800 meters above sea level for nine days in order to film the footage of the mountaineering heroes attacking the main peak.

	Our cameramen have many glorious deeds, and the examples listed here are only part of the events in our newsreel film activities. The vast majority of our comrades, in constantly going deep into life and in the great struggle of reality, have not only recorded many valuable historical materials, but also tempered themselves, transformed their world outlook, and improved their ideological level, making their political sense gradually sharpened.

	Over the past ten years, the films shot by newsreel filmmakers under the leadership of the Party have praised the leadership of the Party, reflected the momentum of our Great Leap Forward, reflected the spiritual outlook of the times and the great spirit of the people, and have therefore been welcomed by the audience. The audience believes that newsreel films are "living newspapers," "living magazines," and "encyclopedias on the screen," and newsreel cinemas are "amateur political universities." These reflections from the audience have given us great encouragement. The great reality of the Great Leap Forward has educated us deeply. This encouragement and education will prompt us to better praise and express the greater leap forward of tomorrow.

    新闻纪录电影永远做时代的尖兵
    丁峤
    新中国的电影事业，是由新闻纪录电影开始的。早在1938年秋天，根据党中央的指示成立了延安电影团。这时全电影团仅有六个人和两台摄影机，电影团的同志们发扬了革命队伍的艰苦奋斗作风，在极端困难的条件下，拍摄了《延安与八路军》、《南泥湾》等影片，纪录了党中央和毛主席若干重要的活动。这些材料已经成了宝贵的历史文献。当时拍摄的影片，是中国历史上第一次拍摄了以工农兵为主人翁的电影，开创了崭新的无产阶级新闻纪录电影的风格和革命的道路，为我国无产阶级电影事业的发展，奠定了良好的基础。
    在大跃进的1958年，新闻纪录电影事业依然是走在电影事业的最前面。1953年以前，主要拍摄新闻纪录片的只有中央新闻纪录电影制片厂，到1958年以后，全国建立了三十三个制片厂，其中专门拍摄新闻片和科教片的有二十二个；新闻纪录电影的从业员，发展到二千多人。1958、1959两年来生产的新闻纪录片，相等于1949年到1957年新闻纪录片生产的总和，仅仅是1958年一年，新闻纪录片发行的拷贝即占全部发行拷贝总长度的32％，占全国各片种总和的三分之一。
    十年来，尤其是大跃进以来，我们摄制了许多优秀的影片，如《英雄赞》、《欢庆十年》、《英雄战胜北大荒》、《第十个春天》、《百万农奴站起来》、《上海英雄交响曲》、《亚洲风暴》等，无论在国内外都受到了观众热烈的欢迎。
    新闻纪录电影，作为上层建筑，紧密地配合了经济基础，密切地为无产阶级政治服务。在毛主席不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的思想指导下，我们纪录和宣传了党在民主革命和社会主义革命时期的巨大胜利。我们尽力地宣传了党的总路线和一系列的方针政策。我们热情洋溢地歌颂了英明、伟大、正确的党，歌颂了我们勤劳勇敢、富有革命传统的中国人民，歌颂了我们社会主义制度的无比优越性和我们伟大的祖国日益繁荣昌盛的景象。此外，在国际宣传方面，我们也配合了各个时期的国际斗争形势，通过影片宣传了党对国际形势的一些基本观点。我们摄制的影片，在党的思想战线上日益明显地发挥着强大的作用。
    在反映革命战争的题材方面，首先我们纪录了中国人民推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义所进行的人民革命战争。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们以充沛的革命热情，不畏一切艰难地拍摄了中国人民为夺取政权所进行的革命战争，纪录了中国革命的历史转折点和伟大的变革。例如我们拍摄的《东北三年解放战争》、《百万雄师下江南》、《淮海战役》、《大西南凯歌》、《红旗漫卷西风》、《解放西藏大军行》、《大战海南岛》等。这些影片，都以它强烈的政论和战斗的作用，对全国人民的革命斗志有很大的鼓舞，在群众中产生了很大的影响。
    中国人民打倒了蒋介石反动派，夺取了政权以后，又迅速地肃清了国民党反动派军队的残余，解放了沿海岛屿。这时，我们拍摄了一系列肃清国民党残余和反对美帝国主义侵略的影片，如《大陈岛解放》、《解放—江山岛》、《严惩蒋贼军》等。
    当我国还在建国的初期，我们就制作了《打击侵略者》、《保卫世界和平》等影片，表明了中国人民反对帝国主义、争取世界和平的基本立场。随后我们又拍摄了一系列以揭露、打击与孤立美帝国主义为主题的影片，如：《抗美援朝》、《美帝细菌战罪行实录》、《美国空投特务罪行展览会》、《美国军事侦察气球的罪行》等等。在这些影片里，我们揭露了美帝国主义的侵略本性，向全世界人民控诉了美国战争贩子的滔天罪行。在《抗美援朝》影片里，我们在全世界人民面前，戳穿了美帝国主义那种貌似强大，实际上是虚弱的纸老虎的本质，证明了毛主席所讲的“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断；歌颂了中朝人民用鲜血和生命凝结成的深厚的友谊和崇高的国际主义精神。
    当帝国主义为了挽救日落西山的命运，在中东点火侵略黎巴嫩，并在台湾海峡制造紧张局势，向我国和全世界人民进行严重挑衅的时候，我们拍摄了《六亿人民的怒吼》、《抗议美国侵略黎巴嫩》、《拥护周总理的声明》、《动员起来粉碎美国侵略者战争挑衅》等影片，表明了我国人民的正义立场，与对中东人民的坚决支持。
    近来，美帝国主义破坏了四国首脑会议，更加暴露了它的侵略本质；亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动风起云涌；资本主义各国的人民革命斗争正在进一步发展；各国人民反对帝国主义战争势力和保卫世界和平的斗争日益高涨，美帝国主义的走狗李承晚和曼德列斯相继垮台，岸信介在强大的人民运动面前也不得不宣告下台，美帝国主义已经陷入了全世界人民的四面楚歌之中，处于空前孤立的境地。在这种形势下，我们大张旗鼓地连续报道了我国人民支援南朝鲜、日本和土耳其人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的英勇斗争，制作了《亚洲风暴》、《瘟神现原形》、《万炮齐发轰‘瘟神’》、《戳穿美帝纸老虎》、《反美大示威》等十多部紧密地配合形势的影片，集中深刻地揭露了美帝国主义假和平、真备战，假和缓、真侵略的反动本质。证明了毛主席对形势所作的深刻判断。毛主席告诉我们：“帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，他们做尽了坏事，全世界一切受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们。”这几部影片所以能产生强烈的战斗作用，主要是充分地表现了人民群众强大的力量和贯彻了毛泽东思想的结果。
    解放以来，我们国家的面貌和人们的精神面貌，都发生了极其深刻而伟大的变化，社会主义制度已经巩固地建立起来了，新的独立的完整的国民经济体系正在形成中，社会主义工业化的初步基础已经建立起来，在生产发展的基础上，人民的文化生活水平也显著地提高了。中国人民正在按照自己伟大的意志，在社会主义建设事业的道路上阔步前进。中国的新闻纪录电影工作者，有责任把这巨大的变化和成就用电影形式纪录下来，从而去鼓舞人民继续前进。我们从国民经济恢复的时候起，就注意了拍摄经济面貌变化的题材。特别是在大跃进以来，我们更加注意充分地反映我国工农业战线上所取得的辉煌成就，同时也注意到反映随着经济建设高潮的到来，我国文化教育事业所出现的空前繁荣昌盛的局面。通过影片，我们也歌颂了我国各兄弟民族在党的领导下的大团结。
    为了真实纪录下我国伟大变革的历史面貌，我国新闻纪录电影工作者的足迹踏遍全国。人们把新闻纪录电影工作者称为“时代的见证人”。新闻纪录电影工作者没有辜负党的教育和人民群众的重托，我们这支队伍，从延安电影团开始到现在，为了真实地纪录下祖国前进的脚步，我们坚决地站在革命斗争的前线。
    为了纪录下我国人民伟大的革命斗争，新闻纪录电影工作者付出了艰苦的劳动，甚至牺牲了可贵的生命。在我国革命斗争中，我们有的同志牺牲在战斗的岗位上，为新闻纪录电影事业，献出了最宝贵的生命。1948年拍摄《东北三年解放战争》的辽沈战役中，摄影师张绍柯、王静安、杨荫萱在战场上流尽了自己最后一滴血；在抗美援朝斗争中，摄影师杨序忠、高庆生英勇牺牲在朝鲜战场上；在拍摄《解放西藏大军行》的影片中，摄影师关志俭在西藏高原献出了青春的生命；摄影师郝凤格为亚非和平事业，遭到敌人凶狠的谋杀。他们为我国新闻纪录电影英勇献身的精神，永远是我们学习的榜样。
    在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时代，我们继承了烈士们的斗争精神，纷纷走向工厂、矿山、建筑工地、农村、深山和沙漠，以普通劳动者的姿态和工农兵群众共同斗争共同生活，发扬了艰苦奋斗和深入实际的作风，其目的就在于要真实而准确地纪录下伟大时代变革的面貌。
    1959年春天，西藏上层反动集团发动反革命叛乱，我们正在西藏工作的新闻摄影师，立即投入了拍摄揭露叛国分子罪行的影片。当上层反动分子强迫、威逼群众集会、游行时，我们摄影师为了真实地纪录下叛国分子的罪证，不顾生命的危险，沉着勇敢地深入到叛乱分子集会游行的场所，进行拍摄工作。当叛乱分子封锁了公路，控制了拉萨制高点时，我们的摄影师就乘装甲车前去拍摄叛匪修筑工事和布防等的镜头，纪录下了叛国分子的罪恶行动。
    为了纪录我国女子登山队攀登“冰山之父”——慕士塔格山顶峰、创造世界女子登山纪录的英雄创举，我们年青的摄影师沈杰同志，战胜了重重困难，光荣地完成了党所给予的任务。沈杰同志登上七千二百米的时候，手和脚都被冻坏了，因此不得不把十个脚趾和两节手指切除。沈杰同志充沛的革命乐观主义精神，不仅使他能够忍受着生理上的痛苦，坚持锻炼，现在，他终于又回到我们的摄影队伍中来了，重新拿起了摄影机投入了新的战斗。
    在今年拍摄我国登山运动员从北坡登上珠穆朗玛峰的影片时，我们的摄影师牟森和王喜茂同志为了忠实地反映这一伟大事件，他们在气候寒冷、高山缺氧、风力大至十二级的情况下，坚持拍摄工作，出色地完成了任务。在登山的过程中，为了选择拍摄角度，往返跋涉在冰雪之中，虽然高山反应已使他们头晕、呕吐，每分钟脉搏跳动一百六、七十次，但他们仍然坚持工作。王喜茂同志登上拔海六千八百米高度时，十个脚趾全部冻伤，他为了争取多拍一些材料，仍然坚持登上拔海七千四百米高度，进行了拍摄工作。牟森同志为了拍摄登山英雄突击主峰的镜头，在拔海六千八百米高度的冰山上生活了九天。
    我们的摄影师有很多光荣的事迹，这里所列举的只是我们新闻纪录电影活动中的部分事例。我们绝大多数的同志，在不断深入生活中，在现实的伟大斗争中，不仅纪录了许多宝贵的史料，同时也锻炼了自己，改造了自己的世界观，提高了思想水平，使自己政治嗅觉逐渐地敏锐起来。
    十年来，新闻纪录电影工作者在党的领导下所拍摄的影片，歌颂了党的领导，反映了我们大跃进的声势，反映了时代的精神面貌和人民的伟大气概，因此受到了观众的欢迎。观众认为新闻纪录电影是“活报纸”、“活杂志”、“银幕上的大百科全书”，新闻纪录电影院是“业余政治大学”。观众的这些反映，给了我们很大的鼓舞。伟大的大跃进的现实，更使我们受到了深刻的教育。这种鼓舞和教育将促使我们更好地去歌颂、去表现更大跃进的明天。
