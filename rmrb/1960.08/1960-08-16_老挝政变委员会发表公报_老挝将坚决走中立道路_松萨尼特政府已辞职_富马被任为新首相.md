Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 15th. Vientiane Radio broadcast a communiqué from the Lao Coup Committee this afternoon, stating that the Coup Committee is determined to implement a neutral policy.

The communiqué stated that the Coup Committee's neutral policy is, both in peacetime and wartime, to not participate in any military organizations, to oppose war, to strive to ease international tensions, and to cooperate with all countries regardless of their political systems.

The communiqué stated that adhering to neutrality requires the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as a guarantee. Currently, there are neutral countries in Asia such as Cambodia, Burma, and Ceylon, and Laos will also follow this neutral path.

The communiqué stated that the reason the Coup Committee overthrew the Chao Somsanith government was because it was deceiving the people under the guise of neutrality.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 15th. According to Vientiane Radio broadcast this morning, the Lao Coup Committee announced that it received a telegram from Luang Prabang at 10:00 AM today stating that the King of Laos has appointed Prince Souvanna Phouma as the new Prime Minister.

According to Vientiane Radio broadcast this afternoon, the Lao National Assembly held a meeting this afternoon, with thirty-eight members present (excluding the speaker). The meeting was presided over by Souvanna Phouma.

Souvanna Phouma said at the meeting that the Chao Somsanith government has resigned, and the King has appointed him as Prime Minister. According to the Lao Constitution, the Prime Minister cannot also serve as Speaker, and he suggested electing another Speaker. Oun Sananikone reported on the work of the National Assembly delegation in Luang Prabang. He also said that former Prime Minister Chao Somsanith and former Minister of Justice Kong Sananikone have returned to Vientiane and also attended today's meeting.

Four candidates were nominated for the position of Speaker of the National Assembly. After voting, Oun Sananikone, the Second Secretary of the Lao People's United Party, was elected as the Speaker of the National Assembly with thirty-three votes.
