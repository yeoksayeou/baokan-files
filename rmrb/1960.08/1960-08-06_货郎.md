    "Peddler"	Xiao Hanqi, Worker at Xinlan Instrument Factory
    The weather is exceptionally clear on Sunday,
    I and Master A Xiang shoulder a pole to go to the countryside.
    Someone asked us what we were going to do?
    Master A Xiang replied with a smile:
    We're going down to be "peddlers" today!
    In the "peddler's" load there are no cigarettes, soap, or soy sauce,
    But hammers, wrenches, and pliers clang.
    Master A Xiang stroked his moustache and smiled:
    "We will make all the 'sick' machines in the commune healthy again!"

    “货郎”	新兰仪表厂工人　萧汉祺
    星期日的天气分外晴朗，
    我跟阿祥师傅挑个担子下乡。
    有人问我们去干啥？
    阿祥师傅笑答：
    今天下去做“货郎”！
    “货郎”的担子里没有香烟、肥皂和醋酱，
    却有鎯头、扳手、老虎钳响叮当。
    阿祥师傅摸着八字胡子笑开了：
    “咱要让公社‘生病’的机器全部恢复健康！”
