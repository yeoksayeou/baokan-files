Contemporary Hero
Wang Shuqin (front), a national advanced producer and telephone operator of the Guiyang City Telephone Section, diligently studies her work and has created advanced switchboard operation methods such as "one quick response, three quick connections, intra-exchange cross-connections, and simultaneous use of both hands." With a new record of 1,276 connections per hour, she has once again broken her own national record of 1,081 connections per hour. Wang Shuqin also actively helps her colleagues learn and master her advanced experience. With her enthusiastic help, 75% of the telephone operators in the Guiyang City Telephone Section have now broken the 1,000-connection barrier (1,000 connections per hour), greatly improving the city's telephone efficiency. This is a demonstration of her experience of using both hands to block lights with her colleagues.

    全国先进生产者、贵阳市市内电话科话务员王淑琴（前），认真钻研业务，创造了“一灵三快，闸内交叉、双手同时并用”等先进接话操作方法，以每小时接线一千二百七十六次的新成绩，再次刷新了她自己创造的一小时接线一千零八十一次的全国最高纪录。王淑琴还积极帮助同伴们学习和掌握自己的先进经验。在她的热情帮助下，现在贵阳市市内电话科已有百分之七十五的话务员突破了千次接线关（每小时接线一千次），使全市电话效率大大提高。这是她正在同同伴们表演双手阻灯的经验。　　　　新华社记者　王正雄摄
