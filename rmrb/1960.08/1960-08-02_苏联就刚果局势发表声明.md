Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 31st: The Soviet government issued a statement on July 31st stating that "If imperialist aggression against the Congo continues, considering the dangerous consequences of such acts of aggression for the cause of universal peace, the Soviet government will not hesitate to take resolute measures to counter the aggressors. It is now abundantly clear that the actions of the aggressors are in fact encouraged by all the colonial powers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

The statement said, "Simultaneous with the attempt to strangle the independence of the Republic of the Congo by force, the aggressors and their accomplices are also attempting to economically suffocate the Republic of the Congo by creating famine and undermining the country's economic life. It is the responsibility of every country that cherishes the ideals of national freedom and national independence to also assist the Republic of the Congo economically."

The statement said, "The Soviet Union expresses its willingness to actively consider the issue of providing broad economic assistance to the Congo in order to create normal conditions for its economic life."

The statement said, "The Soviet government has already sent 10,000 tons of food aid to the government of the Republic of the Congo. A Soviet ship will soon sail to the coast of the Congo to transport one hundred Soviet cargo trucks to the Republic of the Congo.

The Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union will soon send a Soviet medical team to the Republic of the Congo, bringing medicines and necessary medical equipment."

The statement pointed out, "The Soviet government is prepared to provide economic and technical assistance to the Republic of the Congo, and to develop mutually beneficial economic cooperation and trade relations with the Republic of the Congo based on the principles of non-interference in internal affairs, complete equality, and mutual respect, without attaching any political, military, or other conditions that would harm the interests and sovereignty of the independent Republic of the Congo."

    苏联就刚果局势发表声明
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科7月31日讯：苏联政府7月31日发表声明说，“如果帝国主义对刚果的侵略继续进行，考虑到这种侵略行动对普遍和平事业的危险后果，苏联政府将毫不犹豫地采取坚决措施反击侵略者。现在已经十分明显，侵略者的行动实际上是得到了北大西洋公约组织的所有殖民主义国家的鼓励。”
    声明说，“与企图以武力扼杀刚果共和国的独立同时，侵略者和他们的同谋者还企图通过制造饥饿和瓦解国家的经济生活的手段在经济上窒息刚果共和国。每一个珍惜民族自由和民族独立理想的国家的责任，就是要在经济上也援助刚果共和国。”
    声明说，“苏联表示愿意积极地考虑给予刚果广泛的经济援助的问题，以便在刚果共和国创造它的经济生活的正常条件。”
    声明说，“苏联政府已经把一万吨粮食援助送交刚果共和国政府。最近还将有一只苏联轮船开往刚果海岸，给刚果共和国运去一百辆苏联载重汽车。
    苏联红十字会和红新月会联合会最近将向刚果共和国派遣一个苏联医务工作小组，送去药品和必要的医疗设备。”
    声明指出，“苏联政府准备向刚果共和国提供经济和技术援助，并根据不干涉内政、完全平等和互相尊重的原则同刚果共和国发展对双方都有利的经济合作和贸易联系，同时不附加任何损害独立的刚果共和国的利益和主权的政治、军事或其他性质的条件。”
