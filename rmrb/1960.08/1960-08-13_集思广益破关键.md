    Pooling Wisdom to Break Through Key Problems

    After the workers of the four shifts of the large rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company launched a shift-to-shift "relay race," Wang Enyang, the deputy secretary of the Ding shift Party branch and an old rolling mill worker, focused on the weakness of his shift—many new workers and insufficient operational proficiency. Every day, he arrived at the factory early to carefully study the experiences and lessons of the previous shift, using them to promote production in his own shift.

    One day at the end of July, Wang Enyang arrived at the site early again and found that one of the groove shapes on the rolling mill was not correct. The rolled steel billet did not easily enter the next groove shape, wasting a lot of time. After the Ding shift took over, Wang Enyang organized all the rolling mill workers in the shift to launch a fierce attack on this key production problem.

    While adjusting the groove shape himself, he inspired the workers to come up with solutions. Seeing the Party branch secretary so energetic, the workers actively thought of ideas and got to work. They not only quickly adjusted the groove shape but also came up with a way to increase the rolling reduction, so that the rolled steel billets followed one another closely, smoothly entering the next groove shape. In the first hour after taking over, the output of seamless steel tube billets was five more than the highest hourly output of the C shift.

    Driven by the rolling mill workers, the entire shift, from the soaking pit to the cutting machine, immediately launched a collaborative competition. The steel heating workers ensured that the steel billets were heated to the right temperature, and the cutting workers ensured that they cut as much as was rolled... As a result, they completed 112% of the shift plan, and the quality all met national standards.

    Because the leadership took the lead and humbly accepted the experiences and lessons of others, the Ding shift quickly became an advanced shift in the entire factory. Many new workers wrote clappers praising the deputy secretary of the Party branch: "Cadres go deep into the front line, personally imparting good experience. Our technology has greatly improved, our energy soars to the sky. Cadres and workers work together, pooling wisdom to break through key problems." (Ge Shue)

    集思广益破关键
    鞍钢大型轧钢厂四班工人之间，展开班与班“接力赛”以后，丁班党支部副书记、老轧钢工人王恩扬，针对本班新工人多、操作不够熟练的弱点，每天都提前到厂里，留心研究上一班的经验教训，用来推动本班生产。
    7月末的一天，王恩扬又提前来到现场，发现轧钢机上有一个孔型不正，轧出来的钢坯不爱往下一个孔型里钻，耽误不少时间。丁班接班以后，王恩扬就组织全班轧钢工人，向这个生产关键展开猛攻。
    他一边自己动手调整孔型，一边启发工人想办法。工人看到党支部书记干劲这么大，就积极想办法的想办法，动手干的动手干。他们不仅很快地把孔型调整好，还想出了一个加大轧下量的办法，使轧出来的钢坯一根紧跟着一根，顺利地钻进下一个孔型。接班后头一个小时，轧出的无缝钢管坯就比丙班最高小时产量还多五根。
    在轧钢工人的带动下，从均热炉到剪断机，全班立即掀起了协作竞赛。烧钢工人保证把钢坯烧得火候正好，剪断工人保证轧多少剪多少……结果完成班计划112％，质量都达到了国家标准。
    由于领导带头，虚心接受别人的经验教训，丁班很快成了全厂的先进班。许多新工人写快板赞扬党支部副书记：“干部深入第一线，亲自传授好经验。我们的技术大提高，我们的干劲冲破天。干部工人齐动手，集思广益破关键。”（葛树娥）
