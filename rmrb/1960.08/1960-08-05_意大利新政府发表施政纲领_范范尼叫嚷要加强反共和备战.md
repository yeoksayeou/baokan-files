Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 4th Dispatch: The all-Christian Democratic Party Fanfani government, formed after the collapse of the Tambroni government, received a vote of confidence in the Italian Senate yesterday, following behind-the-scenes agreements with bourgeois parties.

Italian Communist Party members voted against the Fanfani government, while the Socialist Party abstained.

In his policy address to both houses of parliament on the 2nd, Fanfani acknowledged that the Christian Democratic Party Tambroni government, which came to power with the support of fascists, collapsed under strong national opposition. He admitted that the Italian people opposed the reactionary tendencies of the Tambroni government and the threat of a fascist resurgence. Fanfani stated that his government would resolutely implement anti-communist policies.

In outlining his foreign policy, Fanfani assured that his government would fully support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He clamored that the current dangers threatening world peace make it necessary to strengthen the Western military system.
