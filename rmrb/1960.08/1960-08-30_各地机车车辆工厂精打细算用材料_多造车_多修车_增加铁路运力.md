Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: Locomotive and rolling stock factory workers across the country are doing everything possible to open up sources of materials, accelerate the manufacturing and maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock, and ensure the needs of railway transportation.

	From January to July this year, the workers of various locomotive and rolling stock factories, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, vigorously carried out technical revolution and diversified operations. The number of locomotives, freight cars, and passenger cars manufactured and repaired for the country was much higher than in the same period last year, and a large number of maintenance parts were supplied. At the same time, according to production needs, they actively expanded the production of more than 200 raw materials such as steel, iron, coke, cement, and welding rods. All these efforts have powerfully guaranteed railway transportation and supported the continued leap forward in steel and coal production.

	In order to build more vehicles and repair more vehicles, the workers in the locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing industry have adopted many methods to tap potential and expand the source of raw materials needed for locomotive and rolling stock production. For example: reforming product design and technology to save materials; collecting scraps, corner scraps, and waste steel; promoting experience in saving materials; organizing the allocation of materials between factories and material matching; adopting substitutes in many ways; and expanding material sources through self-reliance. After these efforts, in July alone, the supporting materials for newly built locomotives increased by more than 30 sets compared to the original supply; the materials for newly built freight cars also increased by more than 500 vehicles compared to the original supply. After completing the annual freight car production task ahead of schedule by half a year, the workers of Shijiazhuang Rolling Stock Factory launched a major revolution in product design and technology for freight car production, reducing the vehicle's weight and improving the manufacturing process. This not only improved efficiency and ensured quality, but also produced an additional 158 freight cars with more than 2,500 tons of various steels saved in the first half of the year through splicing and matching, overfulfilling the July production plan and winning the national locomotive and rolling stock factory's winning red flag. In July, the Party Committee of Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory mobilized workers to vigorously engage in diversified operations using local methods, producing more than 110 kinds of urgently needed raw materials. At the same time, it also educated workers to build vehicles diligently and frugally, saving materials. The workers collected more than 6,000 tons of waste steel from the factory, ensuring the needs of casting production.

	Recently, in order to concentrate forces and ensure key points, the vehicle manufacturing department of the Ministry of Railways has organized locomotive and rolling stock factories across the country to accelerate the manufacturing and repair of key transportation tools used to guarantee the production of the steel, coal, and petroleum industries. It has also made comprehensive arrangements for repairing locomotives and rolling stock, supplying maintenance parts, manufacturing small locomotives, tank cars, and key equipment urgently needed for railway transportation for local railways, ensuring the needs of railway transportation. The Ministry of Railways requires all locomotive and rolling stock factories, under the unified leadership of the provincial and municipal party committees, to proceed from the overall situation, concentrate their forces to prioritize the completion of locomotive and rolling stock repair tasks that require less materials and can be put into operation quickly, and to produce key products on time, in quantity, and in variety. At present, many factories are deeply mobilizing the masses to investigate and implement the materials, accessories, and equipment capabilities required for manufacturing key products. Some factories have assigned special personnel to manage and follow up to the end. The Factory Management Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has organized a working group mainly composed of bureau chiefs and section chiefs to go deep into the factories to assist in solving problems in production. At the same time, it has also drawn forces from various factories to form seven advanced experience promotion groups and four product quality improvement working groups to go to various factories to help improve production capacity and product quality.

    各地机车车辆工厂精打细算用材料
    多造车  多修车  增加铁路运力
    据新华社29日讯　全国机车车辆工厂的职工，千方百计地开辟材料来源，加紧制造与维修机车车辆，保证铁路运输的需要。
    今年1至7月份，各机车车辆工厂的职工，坚持政治挂帅，大搞技术革命和多种经营，为国家制造和修理的机车、货车和客车，都比去年同期增加很多，并且供应了大量的维修配件。同时，还根据生产需要，积极扩大了钢、铁、焦炭、水泥、电焊条等二百多项原材料的生产。所有这些工作，有力地保证了铁路运输，支援了钢、煤生产的继续跃进。
    机车车辆制造工业的职工为了多造车、多修车，采取了许多办法，挖掘潜力，扩大机车车辆生产所需原材料的来源。比如：改革产品设计、工艺，节约材料；搜集边、角余料和废钢铁；推广节约材料的经验；组织工厂之间调剂材料，进行材料配套；多方采用代用品，以及自力更生扩大料源等等。经过这些努力，仅7月份一个月，新造机车的配套材料，就比原来供应的材料增加了三十多台份；新造货车的材料，也比原来供应的材料增加了五百多辆份。石家庄车辆工厂的职工，在提前半年超额完成全年货车生产任务以后，又对货车生产展开了产品设计和工艺大革命，减轻了车辆自重和改进了制造工艺，不仅提高了效率，保证了质量，而且把上半年节余下来的二千五百多吨各种钢材，经过拼接配套，又多生产出了一百五十八辆货车，超额完成了7月份的生产计划，荣获全国机车车辆工厂优胜红旗。沈阳机车车辆工厂党委在7月份发动职工，用土办法大搞多种经营，生产了一百一十多种急需的原材料，同时还教育职工勤俭造车，节约用料。职工们从厂内搜集了六千多吨废钢铁，保证了铸件生产的需要。
    最近，铁道部车辆制造部门为了集中力量，保证重点，已经组织全国机车车辆工厂，加速制造和修理保证钢铁、煤炭、石油工业生产用的重点运输工具，并且对修理机车车辆、供应维修配件、制造地方铁路的小型机车、油罐车和铁路运输急迫需要的关键设备等，进行了全面安排，保证铁路运输的需要。铁道部要求各机车车辆工厂在省、市委的统一领导下，从全局出发，集中力量优先保证完成用料少、投入运用快的机车车辆修理任务，和按质、按量、按品种地及时生产出重点产品。现在，许多工厂正在深入发动群众，对制造重点产品所需要的材料、配件、设备能力等进行查定落实，有的工厂配备了专人管理，一抓到底。铁道部工厂管理总局已经组织了局长、处长级干部为主的工作组，深入各厂协助解决生产中的问题。同时，还从各工厂抽调力量，组成了七个先进经验推广组和四个提高产品质量工作组，分赴各工厂，帮助提高生产能力和产品质量。
