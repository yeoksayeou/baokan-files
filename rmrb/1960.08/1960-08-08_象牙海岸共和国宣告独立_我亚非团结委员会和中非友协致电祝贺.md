Xinhua News Agency, Abidjan, July 7th: The Republic of Ivory Coast, located in West Africa, officially declared its independence today.

This morning, in Abidjan, the capital of this new nation, Ivory Coast President Félix Houphouët-Boigny announced the republic's independence at a ceremony held in the National Assembly. At this moment, gun salutes were fired, and the Ivory Coast's national anthem, "L'Abidjanaise," was played.

On the 6th, French Minister of State Jacquinot, on behalf of the French government, exchanged documents with Houphouët-Boigny regarding France's recognition of the new status of Ivory Coast. Subsequently, a flag-raising ceremony was held.

Ivory Coast is the fourth African country to declare independence in the first week of August. It has an area of 322,000 square kilometers and a population of 3.2 million. Since 1842, when French colonialists occupied Ivory Coast, the local people have been fighting for their country's independence. Under the impact of the surging national independence movement in Africa, the French government was forced to agree to Ivory Coast's independence in July of this year, but it must remain within the "French Community."

Xinhua News Agency, July 6th: The Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee of China sent a telegram to the Prime Minister of the Republic of Ivory Coast on the 5th, warmly congratulating Ivory Coast on its independence.

The telegram said, "The Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee of China extends warm congratulations to the people of Ivory Coast on the declaration of independence of Ivory Coast. The independence of Ivory Coast is the result of the long-term struggle of the people of Ivory Coast against imperialism and colonialism for national independence. The Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the just struggle of the people of Ivory Coast and Africa against colonialism and for independence. We believe that the people of Ivory Coast will continue to achieve success in the struggle to eliminate colonialism, imperialist forces, and consolidate independence. We wish the friendship between the people of China and Ivory Coast will grow stronger day by day."

Xinhua News Agency, July 6th: Liu Changsheng, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, sent a telegram to Ivory Coast President Félix Houphouët-Boigny today, warmly congratulating Ivory Coast on its independence.

The telegram said, "Your country's independence is the result of your country's people's continuous struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The 650 million Chinese people firmly support your country's people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism and are happy for the victory your country's people have achieved in this struggle. We earnestly hope that your country's people will continue to achieve new victories in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. We wish your country prosperity and strength, and your people happiness. We wish the friendly relations between the Chinese and Ivorian peoples will continue to develop."
