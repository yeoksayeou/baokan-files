Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: A rally was held in the capital to support the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament.

China is willing to join hands with the people of all countries to oppose the use of nuclear weapons.

Liao Chengzhi reiterated his firm support for the Japanese people's just struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. Kenzo Nakajima expressed support for Premier Zhou's proposal to conclude a peace pact and establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

The Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament will officially open in Tokyo, Japan, tomorrow. More than 1,500 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand rally this afternoon at the CPPCC Auditorium, expressing their full support for the convening of this conference and firmly supporting the Japanese people's just struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

In its congratulatory message to the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament, the conference solemnly declared: The 650 million Chinese people are willing to stand forever with the Japanese people and the people of the world, and will make even greater efforts to completely smash the war and aggression policies of U.S. imperialism, to strive for the realization of the prohibition of nuclear weapons and general disarmament, and to defend peace in Asia and the world to the end.

Kenzo Nakajima, Director-General of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, and his wife, who are currently visiting Beijing, Hiroshi Teshima, leader of the Japan Socialist Party Policy Deliberation Council Delegation, Japanese peace activist Koichi Saionji, Deputy Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, and his wife, as well as other Japanese friends, attended today's conference. They were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in the capital at the conference.

Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the China Peace Committee and Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, spoke. He said that the Chinese people warmly welcome and fully support the convening of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament, and sincerely wish the conference success. He wished the conference would make new and greater contributions to the Japanese people and the people of the world in opposing the use of nuclear weapons, opposing the imperialist war and aggression forces headed by the United States, and defending world peace.

Liao Chengzhi praised the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle with full enthusiasm. He said that the Chinese people have always firmly supported the Japanese people's desire to take the road of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and firmly supported the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the use of nuclear weapons, against U.S. military bases, against the U.S. occupation of Okinawa, and against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The friendship formed and developed between the Chinese and Japanese people in their common struggle cannot be undermined by any force.

Liao Chengzhi said that the Chinese people have always opposed the use of nuclear weapons, advocated the peaceful use of atomic energy for the benefit of mankind, and have made sincere and unremitting efforts for this purpose. We fully support the proposal repeatedly put forward by our government that countries in Asia and the Pacific region, including the United States, should sign a peace pact of non-aggression with each other, and that this region should become a nuclear-weapon-free zone. This proposal and proposition of our government is in line with the common interests and aspirations of all the people in the Asian and Pacific region. We are willing to work together with the people of relevant countries to realize this proposition. He also said that the Chinese people resolutely oppose and severely condemn the U.S. imperialist adventurous policy of nuclear war and aggression.

Liao Chengzhi said that our government and people have always advocated general disarmament and have made significant efforts to promote disarmament. Our government and people have always supported the Soviet government's initiatives and actions on disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons. However, U.S. imperialism is unwilling to disarm. Only when the people of the world further unite, form a broad united front, and wage an unremitting struggle against U.S. imperialism, resolutely smash its policy of aggression and war, will it be possible to force U.S. imperialism to seriously consider our disarmament proposals and sit down with us to negotiate on disarmament issues.

Kenzo Nakajima, Director-General of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, spoke at the invitation. He pointed out that the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament held in Tokyo will encourage the increasingly combative anti-imperialist forces in Japan and promote the close cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese people.

Nakajima Kenzo said that what the Japanese people unanimously demand first of all is complete independence; to refuse to suffer the fate of becoming an imperialist lackey and being sacrificed; and to strive for the prosperity of the people brought about by peaceful coexistence. The Japanese people have finally begun to realize that their enemy is U.S. imperialism and its accomplices. What kind of independence is it to allow the existence of foreign military bases and the stationing of foreign troops under the pretext of defense? This awakening of the Japanese people is just beginning, but once awakened, they will never fall asleep again, and they will continue to fight for the independence of their country.

Nakajima Kenzo said that advocating the prohibition of nuclear weapons is the right and obligation of the Japanese people who have suffered the most. For Japan, opposing the use of nuclear weapons is directly related to the struggle against foreign military bases, and opposing foreign military bases is directly related to the struggle against imperialist aggression. I fully support and express my respect for the proposal put forward by Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China to the Sixth World Conference that all countries in the Asian and Pacific region conclude a peace pact of non-aggression and make this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

He finally said: U.S. imperialism has invaded Taiwan and is invading Japan by turning Japan into its military base. The struggle for autonomy and independence and the movement against U.S. military bases are surging in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, opening a new page in world history. The final victory will surely belong to the righteous people.

The conference was presided over by Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity. In her opening remarks, she said: The World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament, initiated by the Japanese people and widely supported by peace-loving people from all countries in the world, has been held five times. The past conferences have made significant contributions to promoting the struggle of the people of the world to prohibit nuclear weapons, oppose wars of aggression, and defend world peace. The Chinese people have always firmly supported the just struggle of the Japanese people and the people of all countries in the world against the use of nuclear weapons, against the imperialist policy of war and aggression, and to defend world peace. The Chinese people warmly welcome and support the convening of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament. We sincerely wish the conference success and wish the conference to make new and greater contributions to the people of the world in opposing the use of nuclear weapons, opposing the imperialist war and aggression forces headed by U.S. imperialism, and defending world peace.

These speeches were warmly welcomed. Then, the conference adopted the congratulatory message amidst thunderous applause.

Today's conference was jointly convened by the China Peace Committee, the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, and the All-China Youth Federation. Leaders of various people's organizations and people from all walks of life in the capital attended the conference. Among them were Chu Tunan, Zhang Xiruo, Mei Lanfang, Xu Zhizhen, Tian Han, Shi Liang, Li Menghua, Zhu Ziqi, Peng Siming, Lin Qiaozhi, Guan Shixiong, Sun Fuling, and others.

    首都集会支持禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会
    中国愿同各国人民一起反对使用核武器
    廖承志重申坚决支持日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的正义斗争  中岛健藏表示支持周总理关于缔结和平公约建立无核子武器区的建议
    据新华社5日讯　第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会明天将在日本东京正式开幕。首都各界人民一千五百多人今天下午在政协礼堂举行隆重集会，表示全力支持这次大会的召开，坚决支持日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的正义斗争。
    大会在致第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的贺电中庄严宣称：六亿五千万中国人民愿意永远同日本人民和全世界人民站在一起，并且以更大的努力，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义的战争侵略政策，为争取实现禁止核武器和普遍裁军，为保卫亚洲和世界和平奋斗到底。
    正在北京访问的日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏和夫人，日本社会党政策审议会访华代表团团长手岛博，日本和平人士、亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会副秘书长西园寺公一和夫人，以及其他日本朋友，都参加了今天的大会。他们在大会上受到首都各界人民热烈的欢迎。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席、中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志讲话。他说，中国人民热烈欢迎和全力支持第六届禁止原子弹、氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的召开，并衷心地预祝大会的成功。预祝大会对日本人民和全世界人民反对使用核武器、反对以美国为首的帝国主义战争侵略势力、保卫世界和平，作出新的更大的贡献。
    廖承志满腔热情地赞扬了日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。他说，中国人民一向坚决支持日本人民要求走独立、民主、和平、中立道路的愿望，坚决支持日本人民反对使用核武器、反对美国军事基地、反对美国霸占冲绳岛、反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争。中日两国人民在共同斗争中结成和发展起来的这种的友谊，是任何力量破坏不了的。
    廖承志说，中国人民一贯反对使用核武器，主张和平利用原子能为人类造福，并为此进行了真诚不懈的努力。我们完全拥护我国政府一再提出的关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国、包括美国在内，签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，而且使这个地区成为没有核武器地区的建议。我国政府的这个建议和主张是符合亚洲及太平洋地区全体人民的共同利益和愿望的。我们愿意和有关各国人民为实现这个主张而共同努力。他还说，中国人民坚决反对和严厉谴责美帝国主义这种核战争侵略的冒险政策。
    廖承志说，我国政府和人民一贯主张普遍裁军，并为促进裁军作出了重大的努力。我国政府和人民一贯支持苏联政府关于裁军和禁止核武器的倡议和行动。但是，美帝国主义是不愿意裁军的。只有全世界人民进一步联合起来，结成广泛的统一战线，同美帝国主义进行不懈的斗争，坚决粉碎它的侵略政策和战争政策，才有可能迫使美帝国主义认真地考虑我们的裁军建议，坐下来同我们进行有关裁军问题的谈判。
    日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏应邀讲话。他指出，在东京举行的第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会将鼓舞愈来愈富有战斗性的日本的反帝力量，并促进中日两国人民的密切合作。
    中岛健藏说，日本人民一致要求的首先就是完全的独立；拒绝遭受成为帝国主义走狗而牺牲的命运；以及争取由和平共处带来的人民的繁荣。日本人民终于开始认识到他们的敌人是美帝国主义及其帮凶。以防卫为借口，允许外国军事基地的存在，允许驻扎外国军队，这是什么独立呢？日本人民的这种觉醒是刚刚开始的，但是一旦觉醒就再也不会沉睡，他们必将为自己国家的独立继续斗争。
    中岛健藏说，主张禁止核武器，是受害最大的日本人民的权利和义务。反对使用核武器，对日本来说直接关系到反对外国军事基地的斗争，而反对外国军事基地，又直接关系到反对帝国主义侵略的斗争。我完全支持中华人民共和国周恩来总理向第六届世界大会提出的在亚洲和太平洋地区的一切国家缔结互不侵犯的和平公约并使这个地区成为无核子武器区的建议，并对此表示敬意。
    他最后说：美帝国主义侵略了台湾，并且通过变日本为其军事基地来侵略日本。整个亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、欧洲的争取自主与独立的斗争和反对美国军事基地的运动风起云涌，揭开世界历史的新的一页。最后的胜利一定属于正义的人民。
    大会由中国亚非团结委员会副主席李德全主持，她在致开会词中说：由日本人民发起的，并且得到世界各国爱好和平人民广泛支持的禁止原子弹、氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会已经开过五次了，过去的历届大会都对推动世界人民禁止核武器、反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平的斗争作出了重大的贡献。中国人民一向坚决支持日本人民和世界各国人民反对使用核武器、反对帝国主义战争侵略政策、保卫世界和平的正义斗争。中国人民热烈欢迎和支持第六届禁止原子弹、氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的召开。我们衷心地预祝大会的成功，祝大会对世界人民反对使用核武器、反对以美国帝国主义为首的帝国主义战争侵略势力，保卫世界和平，作出新的更大的贡献。
    这些讲话都受到热烈欢迎。接着，大会在雷动的掌声中通过贺电。
    今天的大会是由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中华全国总工会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华全国青年联合会联合召开的。各人民团体的负责人和首都各方面的人士参加了大会。他们当中有楚图南、张奚若、梅兰芳、许之桢、田汉、史良、李梦华、朱子奇、彭思明、林巧稚、关世雄、孙孚凌等。在北京的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国外宾，参加了今天的大会。（附图片）
