    Promote Effective Measures to Increase Steel Production
    Yunnan Vigorously Improves the Production Level of Existing Equipment and Grasps the Supporting Facilities for Small Converters
    Guizhou's Steel Production Adopts a Method of Long-Term Planning and Short-Term Arrangements with Remarkable Results
    Changchun Comprehensively Inspects Steel Production to Strive for High Yield, High Quality, and Low Consumption

    (Our newspaper, Kunming, 23rd) Yunnan Province's iron and steel industry departments have adopted three measures to ensure the sustained high-quality and high-yield production of iron and steel enterprises. On the basis of a 25% increase in the province's daily steel output in July compared to June, the first half of August saw a further increase of 9% compared to July.

    The first measure is to improve the production level of existing equipment in iron and steel enterprises. The key lies in continuing to focus on the supply of ore and coke, especially to meet the needs of Kunming's iron and steel enterprises, which are the key areas of Yunnan's iron and steel industry. Currently, relevant leading departments have promoted experiences such as rapid tunneling and stripping in mines such as Wangjiatan and Bajie, and increased rock drilling equipment. Iron and steel plants are vigorously improving the utilization coefficient of equipment and reducing iron consumption and coke ratio. Relevant leading departments have put forward various specific indicators. Implementing the first measure can basically guarantee the completion of this year's task. In order to make up for possible gaps in the first measure, two more measures have been taken. The second measure is to increase electric furnace steelmaking with scrap steel, and to remelt existing 30,000 tons of scrap steel. The third measure is to make full use of small converters for steelmaking, and to accelerate the completion of supporting facilities for small converters under construction and put them into production.

    At present, relevant units are taking various effective measures to strive for the rapid realization of the three measures for steel production. Kunming Iron and Steel Plant's steelmaking plant, focusing on improving the production level of existing equipment, has explored a set of experiences based on raw materials, centered on the pig iron furnace, and striving for high quality, high yield, and long life for a single furnace. They focused on pig iron furnaces and established a strict system for managing and batching materials in the post-furnace material yard, driving the converter, steel ladle, briquetting, and bricklaying processes with the pig iron furnace. Kunming No. 1 Steel Plant, in terms of pig iron furnace production, has summarized the experience of determining the proportion of batching based on the changing chemical composition of pig iron, and taken measures accordingly, which has also achieved high quality and high yield.

    (Our newspaper, Guiyang, 23rd) The workers on the iron and steel production front in Guizhou Province, in August, adopted the method of long-term planning and short-term arrangements, with a weekly plan and a weekly summary, launching a solid movement to increase steel production. With the average daily output of steel and iron in the first week of August taken as 100 each, steel rose to 141 and iron rose to 114.4 in the second week, and the quality was also significantly improved.

    In the movement to increase steel production, cadres at all levels went down to the furnaces and mines. In Zunyi Prefecture, there were more than 400 cadres who went deep into 11 factories and mines such as Zunyi Iron and Steel Plant and Tongzi Chumi Iron Plant. The cadres of Yangliujie Iron and Steel Plant strengthened the management of raw materials and fuel alongside the workers at the furnace, and basically achieved "five not entering the furnace" (ore not forged, not entering the furnace; uneven particle size, not entering the furnace; powdered ore and powdered coke, not entering the furnace; ore with high sulfur and low grade, not entering the furnace; furnace materials not tested, not entering the furnace), which played a good role in improving the output and quality of pig iron.

    Under the guidance of the idea of "one heart, one mind, and seizing a great harvest of iron and steel," all relevant departments in the province gave strong support to the iron and steel front in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources. In order to ensure that small blast furnaces were well-fed, the transportation department of Zunyi Prefecture, in addition to fixing a large number of good vehicles for use by various iron and steel plants, also took measures such as opening double shifts and hanging trailers to tap the potential of vehicles and increase the transportation volume of raw materials and fuel. The General Machinery Factory and Farm Implement Factory of the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture transferred a large number of technical personnel to tour various iron and steel plants to take on the maintenance and repair of machines, ensuring the increased production of iron and steel plants.

    (Our newspaper, Changchun, 23rd) Various iron and steel plants in Changchun City have launched a new high tide of high-yield, high-quality, and low-consumption production centered on checking quality, checking output, checking variety, checking equipment, checking opening rate, checking consumption, and checking measures, so that the level of iron and steel production continues to rise. Since mid-August, the city's average daily output of steel ingots has increased by 69.3% compared to the first ten days of the month, the average daily output of steel products has increased by 34.3% compared to the first ten days of the month, and the average daily output of coke has increased by 7.4% compared to the first ten days of the month. The daily output level of pig iron has also been steadily increasing. The qualified rate of steel ingots and steel products has reached 95%, and the qualified rate of pig iron has reached more than 90%. The coal consumption for refining one ton of coke has also decreased from 2.26 tons to 1.76 tons.

    In order to comprehensively complete the iron and steel production plan on time, with quality, quantity, and variety, the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently organized five inspection teams to go to various iron and steel plants, deep into workshops, sections, groups, and in front of the furnaces, to check the quality, output, variety, equipment, opening rate, consumption, and other aspects of iron and steel production, and based on the problems found, conduct analysis and research with the cadres and workers of each plant, actively take measures to ensure a substantial increase in iron and steel production. According to the problems found in the inspection, Changchun Steel Plant implemented a method of everyone checking and setting up checkpoints at every level, so that the cupola furnace achieved "three highs" (high melting efficiency, high furnace life, high molten iron temperature) and "one low" (low sulfur content in molten iron), realizing high yield, low consumption, and long furnace life. Various plants have also generally strengthened raw material management and established a system of quota material requisition, graded stacking, and grouped charging into the furnace, and raw material consumption has decreased significantly. The iron consumption per ton of steel has decreased from 1.52 tons in July to 1.45 tons. In order to solve the problem that the output of the night shift was lower than that of the day shift, each plant divided the management personnel into day and night shifts, and the main leading cadres took the lead in following the night shift production, so that the night shift output was significantly improved. Now, the output of each coke oven of the Dongzhan Iron and Steel Plant has increased by two times compared to the original, exceeding the output of the day shift.

    推行有效措施  促进钢铁增产
    云南大力提高现有设备生产水平抓紧小转炉配套
    贵州钢铁生产采取长计划短安排的方法收效显著
    长春全面检查钢铁生产情况力争高产优质低消耗
    本报昆明23日电　云南省钢铁工业部门采取三项措施，保证钢铁企业持续优质高产。全省钢的日产量，在7月份比6月份增长25％的基础上，8月份上半月又比7月份增长9％。
    第一项措施是提高钢铁企业现有设备的生产水平。关键在于继续抓紧矿石和焦炭的供应工作，特别是满足云南钢铁工业重点地区——昆明各钢铁企业的需要。现在，有关领导部门已在王家滩、八街等矿山推广快速掘进剥离等经验，增加凿岩机具。钢铁厂则大力提高设备的利用系数，降低铁耗和焦比，有关领导部门已提出了各项具体指标。实现了第一项措施，就可以基本上保证完成今年的任务。为了弥补第一项措施可能出现的缺口，又采取了两项措施。第二项措施是增加电炉炼废钢，将现有三万吨废钢回炉冶炼。第三项措施是尽量利用小转炉炼钢，并使正在建设的小转炉加速配套投入生产。
    目前，各有关单位正在采取各种有效办法，争取迅速实现钢铁生产的三项措施。昆钢炼钢厂围绕着提高现有设备的生产水平，已经摸索出了一套以原料为基础，以化铁炉为中心，大闹单炉优质、高产、长寿的经验。他们大抓化铁炉，建立了炉后料场管理和配料的严格制度，以化铁炉带动转炉、钢包、造块和砌修各个工序。昆明第一钢厂在化铁炉生产方面，根据生铁所含化学成份变化较大的情况，总结了以铁水成分定配料比例的经验，并据此采取措施，也收到了优质高产的效果。
    本报贵阳23日电　贵州省钢铁生产战线的职工，8月份采取长计划短安排，每周一计划、每周一总结的方法，展开了一个扎扎实实的增产钢铁的运动。以8月第一周钢、铁的平均日产量各为100，第二周钢上升到141，铁上升到114.4，质量也有显著提高。
    在增产钢铁的运动中，各级干部纷纷下到炉旁和矿山。遵义专区深入到遵义钢铁厂和桐梓楚米铁厂等十一个厂矿的干部，共有四百多人。杨柳街钢铁厂的干部，到炉旁和工人一道加强对原料、燃料的管理，基本做到了“五不入炉”（矿石不锻烧不入炉，粒度不匀不入炉，粉矿、粉焦不入炉，矿石硫高、品位低不入炉，炉料不化验不入炉），对提高生铁产量和质量起到良好作用。
    全省各有关部门在“一条心，一股劲，夺取钢铁大丰收”的思想指导下，在人力、物力、财力方面给予钢铁战线以大力支援。遵义专区运输部门为保证小高炉吃饱吃好，除了把大批好车固定给各钢铁厂使用外，还采取开双班、挂拖斗等办法挖掘车辆潜力，增加原料、燃料的运输量。黔东南苗族侗族自治州通用机械厂和农具厂，抽调大批技术力量，巡回到各钢铁厂担负机器的维护修理工作，保证了钢铁厂增产。
    本报长春23日电　长春市各钢铁厂掀起了以查质量、查产量、查品种、查设备、查开炉率、查消耗、查措施为中心的高产、优质、低消耗的生产新高潮，使钢铁生产水平不断上升。8月中旬以来，全市钢锭平均日产量比上旬提高69.3％，钢材平均日产量比上旬提高34.3％，焦炭平均日产量比上旬提高7.4％，生铁日产水平也稳定上升。钢锭、钢材合格率达到95％，生铁合格率达到90％以上。炼一吨焦的耗煤量，也由2.26吨下降到1.76吨。
    中共长春市委为了按时、按质、按量、按品种地全面完成钢铁生产计划，最近组织了五个检查组分赴各钢铁厂，深入车间、工段、小组、炉前，检查钢铁质量、产量、品种、设备、开炉率、消耗等情况，并根据发现的问题，和各厂干部、工人一起进行分析研究，积极采取措施，保证钢铁生产大幅度增长。长春市钢厂根据检查中发现的问题，实行人人把关、关关设卡的方法，使冲天炉达到了“三高”（熔化效率高、炉寿命高、铁水温度高），“一低”（铁水含硫低），实现了高产、低耗、炉寿长。各厂还普遍加强了原材料管理，建立了限额领料、分级堆放，分组入炉的制度，原材料消耗显著下降。每吨钢的耗铁量，由7月的一点五二吨，降低到一点四五吨。为了解决夜班产量低于白班的问题，各厂都把管理人员分成昼夜两班，由主要领导干部带头跟夜班生产，使夜班产量显著提高。现在，东站钢铁厂每座焦炉夜班的产量，比原来提高二倍，超过了白班的产量。
