Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: Costa Rican Congressman Marcial Aguiluz, who is currently visiting China, condemned the United States here today for using the Organization of American States to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries. He pointed out that the United States is using pressure at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of the Organization of American States currently being held in the Costa Rican capital to interfere in the Cuban revolution. However, it will certainly be opposed by many Latin American countries, and it will not achieve its goals.

Congressman Aguiluz made these remarks today when the Costa Rican Congressional Delegation met with Chinese reporters. He also pointed out that the people of Costa Rica have actively supported the Cuban revolution from the very beginning.

Members of the delegation believe that this visit is the beginning of friendly exchanges between the two peoples, and no matter how U.S. imperialism tries to obstruct it, friendly exchanges must continue. They condemned the U.S. imperialists for obstructing their visit to China, because this visit is not conducive to their slandering and smearing of China. Congressmen Cordero and Lopez described in detail the struggle of the Costa Rican Congress to defend national interests against the intrusion of foreign capital. Cordero also said, "The great achievements of the Chinese people are a great encouragement to us. The Chinese revolution is an example for the oppressed people of Latin America, which is why the United States is preventing us from coming to China."

Congressman Hernández refuted the U.S. imperialist slander that China is bellicose. He said, "The Chinese people are busy with construction, and there are huge development plans in both industry and agriculture. We visited factories and people's communes in Beijing, Shenyang, Harbin, Shanghai and other places in China, and everywhere we saw the symbol of the Chinese people's desire for peace - peace doves."

Congressman Aguiluz said that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal that all countries in Asia and the Pacific region, including the United States, conclude a treaty of non-aggression and make the region a nuclear-weapon-free zone, "further demonstrates China's sincerity for peace."

The members of the delegation also talked about their impressions of their visit to China, praising the construction enthusiasm of the Chinese working people.

    人民的友好往来是阻止不了的
    哥斯达黎加议员阿吉卢斯谴责美帝国主义阻止他访问中国
    据新华社27日讯　正在我国访问的哥斯达黎加议员马西亚尔·阿吉卢斯，今天在这里谴责美国利用美洲国家组织来干涉拉丁美洲国家的内政。他指出，现在在哥斯达黎加首都召开的美洲国家组织外长会议上，美国正在使用压力来对古巴的革命进行干涉。但是，它一定遭到许多拉丁美洲国家的反对，它是达不到目的的。
    阿吉卢斯议员是在今天哥斯达黎加议员代表团接见中国记者时说这些话的。他还指出，哥斯达黎加人民从古巴革命一开始，就积极地给以支持。
    代表团成员们认为这次访问是两国人民友好往来的开始，不管美帝国主义如何进行阻挠，友好往来将必须继续下去。他们斥责美国帝国主义者阻挠他们来中国访问，因为这一访问不利于他们对于中国的造谣诬蔑。议员科尔德罗和议员洛佩兹详细地介绍了哥斯达黎加议会为维护民族利益所进行的反对外国资本侵入的斗争。科尔德罗还说，
  “中国人民获得了巨大的成就，对我们是一个很大的鼓舞。中国革命对于拉丁美洲被压迫的人民是一个榜样，这就是为什么美国阻止我们来中国的原因。”
    议员埃尔南台斯驳斥了美帝国主义污蔑中国好战的谰言。他说，“中国人民正在忙于从事建设，不论工农业都有着巨大的发展计划。我们在中国北京、沈阳、哈尔滨、上海等地参观了工厂、人民公社，到处看到中国人民要求和平的象征——和平鸽。”
    议员阿吉卢斯说，周恩来总理提出的亚洲及太平洋地区一切国家包括美国在内缔结一项互不侵犯条约，并且使这个地区成为无核武器地区的建议，“更表明了中国对和平的诚意。”
    代表团的团员们还谈到了他们在中国访问的印象，赞扬中国劳动人民的建设热情。
