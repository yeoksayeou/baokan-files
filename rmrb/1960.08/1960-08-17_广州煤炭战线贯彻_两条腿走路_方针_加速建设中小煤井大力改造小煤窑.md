    Guangzhou Coal Front Implements the "Walking on Two Legs" Policy
    Accelerating the Construction of Medium and Small Coal Mines and Vigorously Transforming Small Coal Pits
    (Our dispatch) According to the Guangzhou Daily: The Guangzhou Municipal coal industry front is further implementing the "walking on two legs" policy, concentrating its efforts to accelerate the progress of newly built medium and small mine projects and vigorously transforming small coal pits, in order to seize an even greater increase in coal production in the third quarter.

    Since the beginning of this year, Guangzhou's coal industrial production and capital construction have achieved significant results. Coal production in the first half of the year was equivalent to the entire year's production last year. In terms of capital construction, twenty-six pairs of coal shafts are under construction, with over five thousand meters already excavated.

    In order to accelerate the progress of key mine capital construction projects, the Guangzhou Municipal Coal Industry Bureau and its affiliated coal mines are currently vigorously supporting the construction of key capital construction mines with manpower and materials. For example, the Jiahe No. 2 mine, with an annual output of 210,000 tons of raw coal, was experiencing slow capital construction progress due to insufficient power supply caused by a small transformer. The Municipal Coal Industry Bureau allocated a larger transformer to this mine. Shijing Coal Mine and Xiling Coal Mine transferred over two hundred miners to support the construction of the Jiahe No. 2 mine.

    The Municipal Coal Industry Bureau has established a leading group for the transformation of small coal pits and has identified seven pairs of small coal pits as key targets for transformation. Currently, the transformation projects for all seven pairs of small coal pits have commenced.

    广州煤炭战线贯彻“两条腿走路”方针
    加速建设中小煤井大力改造小煤窑
    本报讯　据广州日报消息：广州市煤炭工业战线进一步贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，集中力量，加速新建的中小矿井的工程进度和大力改造小煤窑，以夺取第三季度煤炭更大幅度增产。
    今年以来，广州煤炭工业生产和基本建设取得了较大成绩。上半年煤产量已相当于去年全年的产量；在基建方面，二十六对煤井正在动工兴建，已掘进了五千多米。
    为了加速重点矿井基建工程进度，目前，广州市煤炭工业局和所属各煤矿，正在以人力、物力大力支援重点基建矿井的建设。如年产原煤二十一万吨的嘉禾二号矿井，由于变压器太小，电力不足，影响基建进度。市煤炭工业局便给这个矿井调拨大的变压器。石井煤矿和西岭煤矿抽调二百多名矿工，支援嘉禾二号矿井的建设。
    市煤炭工业局已成立了小煤窑改造领导小组，并确定七对小煤窑作为改造的重点。目前，七对小煤窑的改造工程均已动工。
