Sincere Condolences, Profound Training
By our reporters Yang Ying and He Qilie

More than seventy graduating students from the Performance and Stage Art departments of the Shanghai Theatre Academy went deep into the Fujian front lines to express their condolences to the People's Liberation Army (PLA), perform for them, and learn from them. They achieved great success.

The Highest Stage

In the past, some students regarded red velvet curtains and mercury lamps as essential conditions for a successful performance. After living among the troops on the front lines, influenced by their spirit, the students understood that to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, they couldn't wait for others to prepare the conditions for them to go on stage. Instead, they had to create the performance conditions themselves.

Once, the students heard that several soldiers responsible for observation lived on the summit of an island on the front line. Because the mountain was hundreds of meters high and difficult to climb, the soldiers rarely came down. The students decided to go up the mountain to perform for them. Comrades from the army advised, "The mountain is high and steep, making it difficult to climb, and there's no place to perform. Previous condolence groups only sent a few people up to perform a comic dialogue or a small song, just to express their regards..."

"Precisely because the mountain road is difficult to travel and the soldiers rarely come down, it's rare for them to see a play, so we want to put on the most formal performance possible."

The students carried the scenery and props on their backs. They knew there was no fresh water to drink on the mountaintop, so each person brought a pot of water for the PLA soldiers.

Climbing the mountain was indeed difficult for many students who had never left Shanghai and had never even seen a mountain. While climbing, some fell, some were stung by bushes, and some felt out of breath, but no one wanted to fall behind.

When they reached the summit, their mouths were dry, their backs ached, and their legs were sore, but no one wanted to rest, and no one drank a sip of water from their pot. They immediately prepared for the performance. But where to set up the stage? There was only a flat area of two square meters near the peak. They used it as a stage, and where would the audience sit? Finally, they had the audience sit on the mountaintop looking down at the performance.

The teachers and students performed continuously for three hours on that piece of land, presenting the one-act play "Ordinary Work," "An Unstoppable Force," and some small songs. This was the happiest and most unforgettable performance they had ever experienced.

“Road of Kinship”

On the front lines, washing and mending clothes or polishing shoes for the most beloved people is not easy. Because more than eighty condolence groups had been there before, the officers and soldiers had accumulated a wealth of "experience." However, the students from the Shanghai Theatre Academy washed and mended more than two thousand pieces of clothing and quilts and polished more than one thousand two hundred and fifty pairs of shoes. Their experience was: if you want to serve the soldiers, you must use your brain to find a "way."

Once, a group of female students happened to see a soldier's pants were torn, terribly! The hole was right on his bottom. They knew that if they asked the soldier to let them mend his pants, he would run away. The female students whispered for a while, then stepped forward and solemnly said to the soldier, "Dear Comrade, we can't seem to learn the prone position correctly. Would you be willing to teach us?" "That's easy!" The soldier said, demonstrating a perfect prone position. Unexpectedly, the students swarmed around him, some holding his legs, some pulling his hands, and someone immediately took out the needle and thread they carried and began sewing.

Before leaving the company where they were stationed, eighteen female students decided to leave a small gift for the soldiers. They saw that the soldiers had no road to go up and down the mountain, making it very inconvenient, so they decided to build a road on the small mountain. They borrowed a dozen picks under the pretext of practicing martial arts and secretly started repairing the road at night. Unfortunately, this was discovered by the army, who took away the picks and told them to rest well.

Around midnight, they got out of bed and quietly came to the original site, using the few remaining picks to start working again. In less than an hour, they were discovered by the sentry again. Before the sentry could speak, the students said in a barrage of words, "Dear Comrade, would you like us to sing you a song?" "What song do you like?" The sentry didn't know what to do, so he had to agree not to "leak the secret." But in the end, the news leaked out, and the army leaders came and confiscated the tools.

"We'll build this road even with our bare hands!" Saying that, they began digging on the ground with their hands. The officers and soldiers no longer had the heart to stop them, so they had to join them in repairing the road. When dawn was approaching, the road was finished. A soldier took a wooden sign and inserted it beside the road, with the four characters "Road of Kinship" written on it. A few days later, when the students passed by here, they saw that many flowers and trees had been planted on both sides of the road, and several more "Roads of Kinship" had appeared near this road.

Painting in the Rain

Having left the regimental headquarters for quite some time, the students who were painting looked at the several white plaster walls at the entrance of the regimental headquarters and decided to go back and finish the murals before catching up with the group.

The soldiers brought tea, brought water, and held ladders. The students quickly drafted the ideas they had been preparing for a long time, mixed the paints, and began to paint. At this critical moment, a sudden gust of wind and rain came!

"To serve the soldiers, we must paint well!" No one paid attention to this untimely rain.

Lei Zhineng, who was painting a heroic image of a soldier guarding the motherland's sea frontier, suddenly felt the rain was no longer on his head. Turning around, he saw that someone was holding an umbrella for him. Wasn't this Political Commissar Li, whom he had just met at the regimental headquarters? A remarkable combat hero.

"Thank you, Chief!" Lei Zhineng said, stunned.

"You're working too hard! You're still painting in such heavy rain, stop for a while, don't catch a cold!" Lei Zhineng saw that Political Commissar Li was not wearing a raincoat, had no military cap, was barefoot, and his clothes were all wet. He felt a warm feeling in his heart and also felt sorry, quickly saying, "Chief, look at yourself... go back quickly, you'll catch a cold." "It's okay, I love watching your paintings. You don't know, the soldiers are very excited when they see the paintings you've left behind." Political Commissar Li said with a smile, still advising him to "wait for the rain to stop before painting." "This little bit of rain doesn't matter." Lei Zhineng said, and a few hot tears unconsciously fell. These tears contained a deeper understanding and feeling of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The students were like this, performing wherever they went, painting wherever they labored. Now, magnificent murals painted by the students can be seen everywhere on the front lines. (Attached picture)

### 真挚的慰问  深刻的锻炼

    真挚的慰问  深刻的锻炼	本报记者　杨瑛　何其烈
    上海戏剧学院表演系和舞台美术系的应届毕业生七十多人，深入福建前线，慰问解放军，为解放军演出，向解放军学习，获得很大成功。	  最高的舞台
    过去，有些学生把红丝绒幕，水银灯，看做是演出成功的一个重要条件。来到前线之后，在部队生活的熏陶下，学生们懂得了要为工农兵服务，就不能等人家准备好条件让我们去登台，而要为自己创造演出条件。
    有一次，学生们听说在前沿有个岛屿的山顶上，住着几位担任了望的官兵，因为山高好几百米，上下不方便，战士们很少下山，学生们便决定上山去演出。部队的同志劝阻说：“山又高又陡，上去不容易，演出也没有场地；以前的慰问团都是派几个人上去演个相声或小演唱，表表心意……”
    “正因为山路难走，战士们难得下山，也难得看到戏，所以我们要去作一次最正规的演出。”
    学生们背上布景道具；他们想到山顶上没有淡水吃，每人又为解放军带了一壶水。
    上山，对许多没有离开过上海，连山也不曾见过的同学来说，确实不容易。爬着爬着，有的摔倒了，有的给灌木刺痛了，有的感到喘不过气来，但谁都不甘心掉队。
    到了山顶，口干舌燥，腰酸腿软，可是没有谁想休息，没有谁喝壶里的一口水。马上准备演出，可是舞台搭在哪儿呢？山顶上只有接近山尖有一块二米见方的平地，把它当舞台，观众座又设在哪儿呢？最后就让观众坐在山尖上往下看戏。
    师生们就在那块地上连续演了三小时，演出了独幕剧《平凡的工作》《关不住的一股劲》和一些小演唱。这是他们从来没有尝过的最幸福、最难忘的演出。
            “亲　人　之　路”
    在前线，要为最可爱的人洗涤、缝补一件衣服，擦一双皮鞋，可不是容易的事。因为前后有八十多个慰问团去过了，官兵们积累了十分丰富的“经验”。可是，上海戏剧学院的同学却为他们洗涤和缝补衣服、被子两千多件，擦了一千二百五十多双皮鞋。他们的经验是：你要为战士服务，一定得动脑筋找“门路”。
    一次，一群女同学偶而看见一个战士的裤子破了，糟糕！那个洞正好在屁股上。她们知道若是向战士提出来要为他补裤子，他准会一溜烟跑掉。女学生们咬了一阵耳朵，就上前一本正经地对那个战士说：“亲人，我们对卧倒姿势老学不像，你肯教教我们吗？”“那很容易！”战士说着就做了个漂亮的卧倒姿势。不料同学们一涌而上，有的按腿，有的拉手，有人就拿出随身携带的针线马上缝补起来。
    十八个女同学在离开她们当兵的连队之前，决定要为战士留下一点小礼物。她们看到战士上山下山因为没有路，来往很不便，就决定在小山上辟一条路。她们以练武为理由借来十几把洋镐，晚上就偷偷地修起路来。不巧这事给部队发觉，把洋镐拿走了，要她们好好休息。
    深夜十二时许，她们从床上爬起来，轻手轻脚来到原地用仅剩的几把镐又开起来了，不到一个钟头，又被哨兵发现了。学生们不等哨兵开口，就连珠炮似地叫：“亲人，给你唱个歌好吗？”“你喜欢什么歌？”弄得哨兵不知如何是好，只得答应不“泄密”。可是结果还是走漏了消息，部队的首长赶来，没收了工具。
    “我们赤手空拳也要修好这条路！”说着，她们就用双手在地上扒起来。官兵们再没勇气阻止了，只好和她们一起来修路。天快亮时，路修好了，一个战士手里拿着一块木牌插在这条路旁，上面写着四个大字：亲人之路。隔了几天同学们从这里经过时，看见路两旁种了不少花木，同时这条路附近出现了好几条“亲人之路”。
              雨　中　作　画
    离开团部好一段路了，画画的同学们望着团部门口几块雪白的粉墙，决定回去画好壁画再赶队伍。
    战士们送茶、送水、扶梯子，同学们很快把早就打好的腹稿草拟出来，调好颜料，挥笔画将起来。在这紧急时刻，偏偏来了一阵急风骤雨！
    “为战士服务，一定画好！谁也没有理睬这不识相的雨。
    正在画一位守卫祖国海疆的英雄形象的雷志能，忽然感到头顶雨没有了。掉头一看，原来有人给他打着伞。他不是刚才在团部见过的李政委吗？一位出色的战斗英雄。
    “谢谢首长！”雷志能楞了楞说。
    “你们太辛苦了！下这么大的雨还在画，停停吧，别淋坏身体！”雷志能见李政委没穿雨衣，没戴军帽，赤着脚，衣服都湿透了。心里一阵阵热呼呼地，同时感到过意不去，连忙说：“首长，你看你自己……快回去吧，你要淋坏身体的。”“不要紧，我爱看你们的画。你们不知道，战士们看见你们留下的画可起劲哩。”李政委笑着还是劝他等“雨停了再画”。“这点雨不要紧。”雷志能说着不觉得掉下几颗热泪。这热泪里包含着对为工农兵服务的更深刻的理解与感受。同学们就这样，走到哪里，演到那里；劳动在哪里，画在那里。现在前沿阵地上到处可以看到学生们作的雄伟的壁画。（附图片）
