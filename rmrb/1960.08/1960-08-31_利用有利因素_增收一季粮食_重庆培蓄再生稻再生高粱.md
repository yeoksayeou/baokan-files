(Our report from Chongqing, August 30) People's communes in the suburban districts and counties of Chongqing City are seizing the rice and sorghum harvest season during the campaign to vigorously plant late autumn crops with the focus on increasing grain production. They are cultivating and growing ratoon rice and ratoon sorghum, trying every possible means to increase one more season of autumn grain. Currently, the more than 4,000 mu of ratoon sorghum cultivated in Beibei District have all been fertilized and weeded. Shapingba District, Tongguanyi Commune in Ba County, Yuejin Commune in Changshou County, and Shijiao Commune in Qijiang County have also cultivated several hundred to over one or two thousand mu of ratoon rice and ratoon sorghum respectively. The ratoon rice seedlings are already four to five inches long in some places and are growing vigorously.

Cultivating ratoon rice and ratoon sorghum is a good way for people to increase a season's grain harvest by grasping the laws of nature and utilizing favorable natural factors in production practice. According to past general cultivation experience, this method requires less labor and yields results quickly. Last year, the ratoon rice cultivated by some communes in the suburbs generally produced more than 100 jin per mu, with high yields reaching over 200 jin per mu; ratoon sorghum can also yield dozens of jin per mu. Therefore, the communes in the suburbs, based on a full summary of last year's ratoon rice and ratoon sorghum cultivation, widely publicized to cadres and commune members that this is a good measure to increase grain production, greatly encouraging the commune members' enthusiasm for vigorously cultivating ratoon rice and ratoon sorghum. Many communes, after specific planning by the management area, brigade, and production team, have implemented the tasks at the team level. In order to better cultivate ratoon rice, many communes also held forums for experienced farmers to exchange experiences in cultivating ratoon rice and formulated technical measures for cultivating ratoon rice according to local conditions.

    利用有利因素　增收一季粮食
    重庆培蓄再生稻再生高粱
    本报重庆30日电　重庆市郊各区、县人民公社，在开展以增产粮食为中心的突击增种晚秋作物运动中，抓紧中稻和高粱收割季节，培蓄再生稻和再生高粱，千方百计多增收一季秋粮。目前，北碚区留蓄的四千多亩再生高粱，已经全部施肥、除草。沙坪坝区和巴县铜罐驿公社、长寿县跃进公社、綦江县石角公社等目前都已分别留蓄再生稻、再生高粱几百亩到一两千亩以上。再生稻的苗稼有的已长达四到五寸，生长茁壮。
    留蓄再生稻和再生高粱，是人们在生产实践中，掌握自然规律，利用自然界的有利因素，多收一季粮食的好办法。根据过去一般的培植经验证明，这种办法，费工既少，收效又快。去年市郊一些公社培植的再生稻每亩一般可产一百斤以上，产量高的达二百斤以上；再生高粱一亩也能收几十斤。因此，市郊各公社在充分总结去年留蓄再生稻和再生高粱的基础上，广泛向干部和社员们宣传，说明这是增产粮食的一项好措施，大大鼓舞了社员们大力培蓄再生稻和再生高粱的积极性。许多公社经过管理区、大队、生产队具体规划，将任务层层落实到队。许多公社为了把再生稻培育得更好，还分别召开了老农座谈会交流培育再生稻的经验，因地制宜地制定了培育再生稻的技术措施。
