    An Example of Sino-Western Medical Cooperation
    ——A Record of the Great Leap Forward at Chengdu First People's Hospital
    Wu Kejian
    Recently, I had the opportunity to visit Chengdu First People's Hospital and had cordial conversations with the comrades in charge of the hospital, which gave me beneficial inspiration.
    Chengdu First People's Hospital, correctly implementing the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, has driven a comprehensive leap forward in the hospital's work and achieved brilliant accomplishments, becoming a red flag for health work in the entire city and province. Now, the Chengdu Health Bureau is calling on all hospitals in the city to launch a campaign to "Learn from First Hospital, Catch up with First Hospital, Surpass First Hospital."
    Since the Central Committee of the Party issued its instruction on November 18, 1958, regarding the summary report of the Party Group of the Ministry of Health on organizing Western doctors to leave their posts to study traditional Chinese medicine, Chengdu First People's Hospital has further earnestly implemented the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. As of now, more than 90% of the Western doctors and medical staff in the hospital have studied traditional Chinese medicine, and they have learned and mastered the basic theories of traditional Chinese medicine and techniques such as acupuncture and massage. More than 40% of the Western doctors can initially grasp the theory, methods, prescriptions, and medicines of traditional Chinese medicine, and can adopt a combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine to diagnose and treat diseases. Currently, Western doctors in the hospital can use traditional Chinese medicine to treat more than 70 kinds of diseases, and have initially mastered both traditional Chinese and Western medicine techniques. At the same time, the hospital also organized qualified traditional Chinese medicine doctors to study Western medicine. Some traditional Chinese medicine doctors have also studied anatomy, physiology, bacteriology, pharmacology, etc., and have initially applied it to clinical diagnosis. Because Sino-Western medical cooperation has become possible, currently, about 70% to 80% of the patients admitted to all departments of the hospital are treated with a combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and the curative effect has been significantly improved.
    Why has Chengdu First People's Hospital been able to achieve such great results? This is because the Party organization and administrative leaders of Chengdu First People's Hospital, in the process of implementing the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, first grasped the key of ideological work. In our country's health work force, there is the relationship between Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. This relationship issue mainly belongs to the aspect of ideological understanding, and at the same time, each holds different views on academics. The vast majority of Western doctors in Chengdu First People's Hospital support the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine and actively study traditional Chinese medicine. Many of them have studied well and applied it effectively. However, there are still a few people who have thoughts of belittling, discriminating against, and even excluding traditional Chinese medicine. They mistakenly believe that traditional Chinese medicine can treat internal (medicine) but not external (surgery), can treat chronic diseases but not bacterial acute diseases, and can treat diseases but not explain diseases. Some Western doctors have excessively high demands for the curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine, holding an attitude of negating everything if one prescription is ineffective. Some believe that "it is not good to use traditional Chinese medicine when the condition is critical." Some believe that "it is not easy to summarize the curative effect of Sino-Western medical cooperation." On the other hand, a few traditional Chinese medicine doctors also have a sense of pride and complacency. In cooperating with Western doctors, they emphasize that the other party should "respect" themselves. In treatment, they believe that "Western medicine is nothing," and do not seriously study some reasonable opinions of Western doctors. The Party organization and administrative leaders of Chengdu First People's Hospital carefully analyzed the above ideological situation and believed that at that time, a small number of people in traditional Chinese medicine did have conservative ideas of sticking to old ways and not seeking progress, but the main thing was still that Western doctors held a nihilistic, bourgeois ideology of negating traditional Chinese medicine towards the nation's valuable heritage.
    In response to the above ideological situation, Chengdu First People's Hospital adopted the principle of treating them separately. All issues belonging to academic viewpoints are resolved in accordance with the principle of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." For ideological issues, we adopt the method of patient persuasion and active assistance. This method of persuasion and assistance is not carried out in isolation, but is integrated into specific business practices. In order to strengthen the leadership of the Party and implement the spirit of this principle, the hospital first made repeated mobilizations within the Party and League organizations, explained the Party's policies and practices in detail, and raised ideological awareness so that everyone could play a model leading role in learning. At the same time, policy education was repeatedly conducted for senior technicians through symposiums to clear the minds of senior technicians. For the masses of the whole hospital, methods such as great airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates were adopted. In the debates, we insisted on presenting facts and reasoning, exposing many contradictions in thought and work, and conducting specific analysis and handling to solve ideological and work problems. In this way, the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine has been effectively implemented among medical personnel throughout the hospital.
    In order to carry out this meticulous ideological work through business practices such as Western doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine, they conscientiously implemented the guiding principle of "systematic learning, comprehensive mastery, and consolidation and improvement" in learning methods, and adopted a variety of forms. They combined intensive learning with regular learning. Intensive learning is mainly to set off a learning upsurge, create momentum, and open up the learning situation. However, intensive learning is difficult to sustain, and the most important thing is to adhere to regular learning. In terms of regular learning, they adopted various forms such as leaving their posts to study, studying in their spare time, Western doctors apprenticing to traditional Chinese medicine doctors, learning the clinical experience of old traditional Chinese medicine doctors, traditional Chinese medicine doctors taking apprentices, clinical internships, starting with one prescription for one disease, Sino-Western medical clinical consultations, clinical discussions, studying case records, and academic exchanges, which have received the benefits of adapting to the time and adapting to people. No matter what kind of learning, they have a most important secret, which is to combine learning with medical treatment, that is, to combine theory with practice. For example, according to the needs of various clinical diseases and the occurrence of seasonal and common diseases in the outpatient clinic, prescriptions are selected according to the disease, starting with one prescription for one disease, and then gradually increasing the content of systematic learning. At the beginning, although it is piecemeal learning, because it is combined with medical treatment, what is learned is used, and the effect is seen when it is used, the education on implementing the policy on traditional Chinese medicine can be continuously deepened. For example, after the success of the combined treatment of Japanese encephalitis and the cure of difficult diseases such as vaginal bladder leakage and osteoma with traditional Chinese medicine, the enthusiasm and confidence of the masses in learning have been improved, and the wrong views of Western medical personnel on traditional Chinese medicine have been changed, and the confidence in the combined treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine has been strengthened, and the effect is good. Moreover, in the treatment process, a set of Sino-Western medical cooperation treatment plans and rules has also been explored for the treatment methods of certain diseases.
    Due to the united cooperation of traditional Chinese and Western medicine in treating diseases, the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine has been strengthened, and academic exchanges between traditional Chinese and Western medicine have also been promoted. For example, after the innovative experiment in treating hepatitis has achieved preliminary results in technical operation, it is said that no theoretical basis has been found in traditional Chinese medicine theory. With the encouragement of the Party, the comrades of Western internal medicine department gave full play to the spirit of large-scale cooperation and cooperated in research, and made expositions and explanations from the perspective of physiological functions, which gave traditional Chinese medicine doctors a lot of inspiration. And when Western doctors saw that traditional Chinese medicine was effective in treating hepatitis, they felt from the experiment that the meridian theory of traditional Chinese medicine was indeed reasonable, and they continued to strengthen cooperation. At present, traditional Chinese and Western medicine have jointly written 32 scientific research papers and actively carried out scientific research work.
    All the above achievements made by traditional Chinese and Western medicine in cooperative clinical practice and scientific research have enabled traditional Chinese and Western medicine to receive vivid and profound education, greatly promoting their ideological transformation. For example, a Western surgeon used to hold a skeptical and contemptuous attitude towards traditional Chinese medicine, but after the education of the Party and the experience of clinical practice, he gradually changed his attitude, actively studied traditional Chinese medicine, and apprenticed to traditional Chinese medicine doctors. He said: "I deeply realize that the process of learning traditional Chinese medicine is also the process of my ideological transformation." In addition to participating in spare-time traditional Chinese medicine school, he also actively bought a lot of traditional Chinese medicine reference books for self-study. At present, he can basically use the theory, methods, prescriptions, and medicines of traditional Chinese medicine and can treat diseases such as sepsis and appendicitis. Traditional Chinese medicine doctors also realized in their own treatment practice that it is sometimes difficult to make a definite diagnosis in traditional Chinese medicine in terms of diagnostic methods due to the lack of modern scientific knowledge of clinical testing, and it is impossible to draw a conclusion for certain diseases for a while. Therefore, they took the initiative to ask Western doctors to consult together and actively cooperate with Western doctors. This is already a common phenomenon in traditional Chinese medicine. This not only enhanced the mutual trust between traditional Chinese and Western medicine and promoted the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, but also enriched the experience of combined treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine and improved the curative effect.
    The implementation of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine in Chengdu First Hospital also drove the Great Leap Forward of the entire hospital's work, promoted the technical innovation and technical revolution movement throughout the hospital, and enabled the hospital's management system to be further reformed, and the entire hospital took on a new look. The political consciousness of traditional Chinese and Western medical personnel has been improved, the service attitude has been greatly improved, and the spirit of communist cooperation has been greatly promoted, changing the past situation of mutual independence and lack of contact between departments. Now, no matter which department of traditional Chinese and Western medicine in this hospital, they actively participate as soon as they receive the consultation notice from the hospital. Especially in the rescue of critically ill patients, all units in the hospital are competing to provide support. Everyone feels honored to be able to make a contribution in the rescue work. When the surgery department admits burn patients, all departments take the initiative to send nursing staff to assist, the pharmacy also takes the initiative to deliver medicines to the door, the inspector brings furniture to live in the ward, and the logistics department actively supplies all the necessary materials. If the patient is dying and needs a blood transfusion, all the staff of the hospital always hesitate to contribute their blood without hesitation. It is truly achieved that one person has something to do, the whole department supports, and one department has something to do, the whole hospital supports.
    From the successful experience of Chengdu First People's Hospital, it once again proves the correctness of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. It also proves that: "Conscientiously implementing the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine is the key to strengthening the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine and better serving the people." At the same time, it also makes people more believe that the new Chinese medicine school that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao earnestly expect will surely achieve rapid growth.

    中西医合作的一个范例
    ——记成都市立第一人民医院的跃进
    吴克坚
    最近，我有机会参观了成都市第一人民医院，并和该院负责同志们进行了亲切的谈话，得到了有益的启发。
    成都市第一人民医院，正确贯彻执行党的中医政策，带动了医院工作全面大跃进，取得了辉煌的成就，已成为全市全省卫生工作的一面红旗。现在成都市卫生局正号召全市医院开展“学一院、赶一院、超一院”的运动。
    自从1958年11月18日党中央发布了对卫生部党组关于组织西医离职学习中医总结报告的批示以后，成都市第一人民医院，进一步认真贯彻党的中医政策。截至目前为止，全院有90％以上的西医、医护人员学习了中医，他们学习和掌握了中医的基本理论和针灸、推拿等技术；有40％以上的西医师能够初步掌握中医的理、法、方、药，能够采取中西医相结合的方法诊治疾病，目前全院西医已能用中医中药治疗七十余种疾病，初步掌握了中西医两套技术。同时，医院也组织了有条件的中医学习西医，有些中医也已学过解剖学、生理学、细菌学、药理学等，并把它初步应用到临床诊断方面。由于中西医合作有了条件，现在，全院各科收治的病员中，采取中西医结合治疗的约占70％至80％，而且显著地提高了疗效。
    成都市第一人民医院为什么能够取得这样大的成绩呢？这是由于成都市第一人民医院的党组织和行政领导，在贯彻执行党的中医政策的过程中，首先抓住了思想工作这个关键。在我国卫生工作队伍中，存在着西医和中医的关系问题。这种关系问题，主要是属于思想认识方面，同时在学术上也各持有不同见解。成都市第一人民医院的西医，绝大部分人对党的中医政策是拥护的，积极学习中医，其中有不少人是学得好、应用得有成效的。但也还有少数人存在着轻视、歧视、甚至排斥中医的思想，他们错误地认为中医可治内（科）不能治外（科），可治慢性病不能治细菌性急性病，可治疾病而不能解释疾病；有的西医对中医疗效要求过高，抱一方无效、全盘否定的态度；有的认为“病情危重，不好用中药”；有的认为“中西医合作不好总结疗效”。另方面有少数中医，也存在有骄傲自满情绪，在和西医合作中强调要对方“尊重”自己，在治疗中认为“西医就是没有什么”，对西医的某些合理意见不去认真研究。成都市第一人民医院的党组织和行政领导认真分析了以上的思想情况，认为当时中医中少数人确有故步自封、不求进步的保守思想，但主要的仍然是西医对民族宝贵遗产，抱着虚无主义的、否定中医的资产阶级思想。
    成都市第一人民医院针对上述的思想情况，采取了分别对待的原则。凡是属学术观点问题，则本着
  “百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针来解决；属于思想问题，则采取耐心说服和积极帮助的办法。而这种说服与帮助办法，不是孤立地进行，而是把它贯穿到具体业务实践中去。为了加强党的领导，贯彻这一原则精神，该院即首先在党、团组织内部作了反复的动员，详细交代了党的政策和作法，提高思想认识，使大家在学习中能起模范带头作用。同时又通过座谈会方式，对高级技术人员反复进行政策教育，打通高级技术人员的思想。对全院的群众则采取大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论的办法，在辩论中坚持摆事实、讲道理，揭露思想和工作中的许多矛盾，并进行具体分析，加以具体处理，使思想和工作问题获得解决。这样，就使党的中医政策在全院医药人员中，真正得到了有效的贯彻。
    为了使这种细致的思想工作通过西医学习中医等业务实践来进行，在学习方法上，他们认真贯彻了
  “系统学习、全面掌握、整理提高”的方针，采取了多种多样的形式。他们把突击学习与经常学习结合起来。突击学习主要是要掀起学习高潮，大造声势，打开学习局面。但是突击学习难于持久，最主要的还是要坚持经常性的学习。他们在经常性的学习方面，采取了离职学习，业余学习，西医拜中医为老师，学习老中医的临床经验，中医带徒弟，临症见习，从一病一方学起，中西医临床会诊，临床讨论，研究病案，学术交流等各种形式，收到了因时制宜、因人制宜的好处。不管哪种学习，他们有一个最要紧的窍门，就是把学习和医疗结合起来，也即是理论和实际联系起来，如根据各种临床疾病的需要和门诊上季节病、多发病的发生，按病选方，从一病一方学习，然后逐步增加系统学习的内容。在开始时，虽然零碎的学，但由于结合了医疗，学了就用，用了见效，对于贯彻中医政策教育就可以不断深入。例如乙型脑炎结合治疗的成功，中医药治愈阴道膀胱漏及骨瘤等疑难病后，这样就提高了群众学习情绪和信心，并且改变了西医人员对中医中药的错误观点，加强了中西医结合治疗的信心，效果良好。而且，在治疗过程中，对某些疾病的治疗方法，也摸索出一套中西医合作治疗的方案和规律。
    由于中西医团结合作治疗疾病，加强了中西医的团结合作，也促进了中西医在学术上的交流。例如通过治疗肝炎的革新试验后，在技术操作上取得了初步成效，但在中医理论上，据说还没有找出理论根据。西医内科的同志，在党的鼓励下，发挥了大协作的精神，配合研究，从生理机能上作了阐发和说明，使中医看了也有很大的启发。而西医看见中医对治疗肝炎有成效，从试验中也感到中医经络学说确有道理，不断加强了合作。目前，中西医已共同写出科学研究论文三十二篇，积极开展科学研究工作。
    所有中西医在合作临床和开展科学研究上取得了以上的成就，都使中西医受到了活的深刻的教育，大大促进了他们的思想改造。例如一位外科西医同志，过去对中医是抱着怀疑、轻视的态度的，但经过党的教育和临床实践的体会，使他逐步转变了态度，积极学习中医，拜中医为师。他说：“我深深体会到学习中医的过程，也就是我思想改造的过程。”他除了参加业余中医学校学习外，还主动地买了很多中医参考书自修，目前他已基本能使用中医的理、法、方、药，能治疗如败血症、阑尾炎等疾病。而中医在自己治疗实践中，也认识到中医在诊断方法上，由于缺乏临床检验的现代科学知识，有时确诊比较困难，对某些病一时无法作出结论，因此，他们主动要求西医一起会诊，主动地和西医合作，这在中医中已是普遍的现象。这样不但增进了中西医相互间的信任，促进了中西医间的团结合作，而且丰富了中西医结合治疗的经验，提高了疗效。
    党的中医政策在成都市第一医院的贯彻执行，也带动了医院整个工作的大跃进，促进了全院的技术革新和技术革命运动，使医院管理制度也进行了进一步改革，全院面貌一新。中西医务人员的政治觉悟提高了，服务态度大大改善了，共产主义大协作的精神大大得到了发扬，改变了过去科室间互不相干、互不联系的状况。现在，这个医院不论哪一科的中西医，一接到院部的会诊通知，都积极地参加。特别是在抢救重危病人方面，全院各单位更是争先恐后地进行支援，大家都为能在抢救工作中作出一点贡献感到光荣。外科在收治烧伤病人时，各科都主动派护理人员前去协助，药房也主动送药上门，检验员并带上家具住到病房，总务科则积极供应一切需要的材料，如果病人垂危需要输血时，全院工作人员总是毫不犹豫地争先献出自己的鲜血。真正做到了一人有事全科支援，一科有事全院支援。
    从成都市第一人民医院的成功经验看来，再一次证明党的中医政策的正确。也证明了：“认真贯彻党的中医政策，是加强中西医团结合作、更好地为人民服务的关键”。同时，也使人们更加相信，党中央和毛主席所殷切期望的中国新医药学派，也一定能够获得迅速的成长。
