Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, August 25th (Reporter Zhao Yong'an): More than 50,000 cadres in Jiangxi Province who have been transferred to mountainous areas for labor training have, over the past three years, developed a style of hard work and diligence, eating, living, working, and consulting with the people in the mountainous areas. They have transformed more than 200 desolate and backward mountainous areas into thriving new socialist mountain areas.

After these cadres were sent to remote mountainous areas in 1957 to establish state-owned comprehensive agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry reclamation farms, they settled down in thatched huts and sheds in the wilderness. Over the past three years, they have opened roads through mountains and built bridges over rivers, braving wind, snow, and scorching sun, cutting through thorns and brambles. Together with the people in the mountainous areas, they have established more than 200 large-scale state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms, managing more than 30 million mu of mountain forests and more than 2.8 million mu of cultivated land. Among them, the area of newly afforested land reached 2.4 million mu, and the area of newly reclaimed wasteland was more than 300,000 mu. In addition, they also planted more than 200,000 mu of fruit trees, tea forests, and mulberry forests, raised more than 600,000 head of livestock, more than 2 million poultry, and established more than 2,000 various factories, providing the state with large quantities of commodity grain, timber, industrial raw materials, pork, poultry, fresh eggs, and various local specialties from the mountainous areas every year.

The vast number of transferred cadres, in the course of building the mountainous areas, with a high degree of revolutionary heroism, worked hard and launched a "treasure hunting" movement of "demanding grain from the fields, demanding oil and wine from wild grass and wild fruits, demanding timber from barren mountains, and demanding fish from water." In Jinggang Mountain, in order to develop the bamboo and wood resources in Daba, which is 1,600 meters above sea level and full of cliffs, a group of transferred cadres led by Communist Party member Wang Zhibu built thatched huts in this isolated place. Sometimes, when the food supply was not available, they hunted pheasants and wild animals. They used hoes and stones to break the ice and snow on the 20-plus-mile mountain road bit by bit, opening up a road to connect with the outside world, and then built a bamboo slide more than ten miles long to transport Mao bamboo. After three months of hard work, they completed the task of felling 300,000 Mao bamboo and opened up a new forestry base here. Wufeng Cave in Damao Mountain, an old revolutionary base area, had more than 80 households during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. After the Red Army left, the Kuomintang reactionaries implemented a brutal policy of burning and killing, and not a single person or tile remained in the entire village of more than 300 people and dozens of houses. Until 1957, no households could be found within a radius of ten miles, and the mountains were full of thorns and weeds. After the transferred cadres came here, they worked from dawn till dusk, braving the wind and dew, cutting through thorns, cutting weeds, opening up more than 100 mu of gardens, planting fruit trees, vegetables, and establishing dozens of small factories. They also built more than 10,000 square meters of factories, schools, dormitories, and auditoriums, and leveled stone walls to build a road leading to the foot of the mountain, turning this place into a prosperous and beautiful mountain city.

In order to accelerate the construction of mountainous areas, the transferred cadres were diligent and thrifty, and worked hard to study, rarely asking the state for investment or equipment, and started thousands of small factories from scratch, producing a large number of industrial raw materials and various industrial products for the state. In Damao Mountain alone, more than 900 various factories were established from scratch. Fan Yonglin, a transferred cadre from the Shuanghu branch of Jiulian Mountain, saw an article in a technical magazine introducing the use of pine roots to extract petroleum, and immediately studied it with several comrades. They used rice cookers instead of steel dry distillation furnaces, and used fire bricks instead of pig iron for the grate bars. Without gas导管coolers, they used bamboo tubes buried in the ground through a pool to replace them, and set up a "native" artificial petroleum factory. After repeated experiments and multiple failures, they finally extracted pine root tar from the pine roots. In the second quarter of this year alone, they produced 21 tons of pine root tar. The cadres transferred to Huanggang Mountain, in order to enable the people in the mountainous areas to use electricity, did not ask the state for a single bit of cement or steel bars. They braved the piercingly cold wind and, in waist-deep water, built dams with earth and stones to block floods and build hydropower stations, making the mountains shine with electric lights.

The transferred cadres personally built factories, farms, and ranches, cultivating their excellent qualities of diligence and thrift, and knowing how to cherish the fruits of other people's labor. Jia Yongli, a transferred cadre from the Jiulian Mountain Reclamation Farm, was very distressed to see that the mortality rate of the chicks raised in the farm was very high. He automatically asked the Party organization to go to the chicken farm. Because of his careful observation, he mastered the living habits of the chickens, took care of them according to their individual circumstances, and also went to the wild to find some tender grass that the chickens liked to eat, and caught some small shrimps and small fish to cook into soup and mix in the food to feed the chicks. He raised all the chicks, greatly developing the farm's poultry production.

The transferred cadres love the mountainous areas and, even more so, the people in the mountainous areas. They eat, live, work, and consult with the people in the mountainous areas, care about the hardships of the people in the mountainous areas, serve the people in the mountainous areas wholeheartedly, and have established very deep feelings with the people in the mountainous areas. In their work, like the Red Army of that year, they worked during the day and, during their spare time, helped the masses carry water and chop firewood. In the evenings, they also went door-to-door to help the masses learn to read and eliminate illiteracy, and took extra care of the lonely, widowed, old, and young. Wherever they went, they helped the people in the mountainous areas to organize night schools, Red and Expert schools, establish primary schools, kindergartens, and nurseries, run various cultural and welfare undertakings, and carry out cultural and recreational activities. In some mountainous areas with long-term prevalent diseases, they helped establish health centers, hospitals, and maternity hospitals to help the masses treat diseases and eliminate pests.

The cadres care about the masses, and the masses also love the cadres. The broad masses call the transferred cadres "Old Red Army" and "Land Reform Teams." They enthusiastically send tea and water to the transferred cadres, guide the way, help develop the mountainous areas, and some even compete to have the transferred cadres live in their homes. During festivals, they often invite the transferred cadres to their homes as guests, as close as family members. (Attached picture)

### 江西五万下放干部埋头苦干建设新山区  三年来在荒山中建立了二百多个大型综合垦殖场，办起两千多个工厂  干部热爱山区人民，群众热爱干部称他们是“老红军”和“土改队”

    江西五万下放干部埋头苦干建设新山区
    三年来在荒山中建立了二百多个大型综合垦殖场，办起两千多个工厂
    干部热爱山区人民，群众热爱干部称他们是“老红军”和“土改队”
    据新华社南昌25日电　记者赵永安报道：江西省下放山区劳动锻炼的五万多名干部，三年来发扬了艰苦朴素、埋头苦干的作风，和山区人民同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，把二百多个荒凉、落后的山区，建设成了欣欣向荣的社会主义新山区。
    这些干部1957年下放到偏僻山区建立国营农林牧综合垦殖场以后，就在荒山野岭搭起茅屋草棚安家落户。三年来，他们逢山开路，遇水搭桥，冒着风雪和烈日，披荆斩棘，和山区人民一道，在荒山中建立了二百多个大型国营综合垦殖场，经营着三千多万亩山林，二百八十多万亩耕地。其中新造林的面积即达二百四十万亩，新垦荒地三十多万亩。此外，他们还种植了二十多万亩果树、茶林、桑林，饲养了六十多万头家畜，二百多万只家禽，兴办了二千多个各种工厂，每年为国家提供大批的商品粮食和木材、工业原料、猪肉、家禽、鲜蛋和各种山区土特产。
    广大下放干部在建设山区中，以高度的革命英雄主义气概，艰苦奋斗，展开了一个“向山田要粮，向野草、野果要油要酒，向荒山要木材，向水要鱼”的“要宝”运动。在井冈山，为了开发拔海一千六百米、尽是悬崖陡壁的大坝里的竹木资源，由共产党员王智甫率领的一批下放干部，在这个与外界隔绝的地方架起了茅棚，有时，粮食供应不上，他们就猎食山鸡、野兽。他们用锄头和石子把二十多里山道上的冰雪一点一点敲碎，打通了和外界联络的道路，然后又架起一条十多里长的滑运茅竹的竹滑道。这样艰苦奋战三个月，完成了砍伐茅竹三十万根的任务，并在这里开辟出一个新的林业基地。老革命根据地大茅山乌风洞，在第二次国内革命战争时期有八十多户人家，红军离开以后，国民党反动派实行残酷的烧杀政策，全村三百多人口、几十栋房屋不存一人片瓦。直到1957年，周围十里方圆还找不到一户人家，满山都是荆棘茅草。下放干部来到这儿以后，披星戴月，风餐露宿，斩断荆棘，割掉茅草，开出一百多亩园林栽上果树，种了菜蔬，建立起几十个小型工厂，还修了一万多平方米的工厂、学校、宿舍、礼堂，削平石壁建成了通往山下的公路，使这里变成了一座繁荣美丽的山城。
    下放干部为了加速山区建设，克勤克俭，刻苦钻研，很少向国家要投资、要设备，白手起家办起了成千个小型工厂，为国家生产了大批工业原料和各种工业产品。仅大茅山一地，白手起家兴办的各种工厂即达九百多个。九连山爽湖分场的下放干部范永林，在一本技术杂志上看到介绍利用松根提炼石油的文章，就立即和几个同志一起研究，他们用煮饭的锅代替钢松干馏锻炉，没有生铁做炉条就找火砖代替，没有瓦斯导管冷却器就用竹筒埋在地里通过水池来代替，办起了一个“土”人造石油厂，经过反复试验、多次失败，终于从松根中提炼出了松根焦油。仅今年第二季度就生产了二十一吨松根焦油。下放到黄岗山的干部们，为了使山区群众能够用上电，没向国家要一点水泥、钢筋，冒着刺骨的寒风，在没腰深的大水里，用土石筑坝拦洪，建成了水电站，使满山电灯放光。
    下放干部亲手建起了工厂、农牧场，培养了他们克勤克俭，懂得爱惜别人劳动成果的优良品质。九连山垦殖场的下放干部贾永利，看到场里养的小鸡死亡率很大，十分心痛，自动向党组织要求到养鸡场去。由于他细心观察，掌握了鸡的生活规律，分别情况来照料，还到野外找些鸡喜欢吃的嫩草，捉一些小虾、小鱼煮成汤来拌在食里喂小鸡。把小鸡都养大了，使场里的家禽生产有了很大发展。
    下放干部们热爱山区，更热爱山区人民，他们和山区人民同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，关心山区人民的疾苦，全心全意为山区人民服务，和山区人民建立了十分深厚的感情。他们在劳动中，和当年的红军一样，白天劳动，利用工余帮助群众挑水、打柴，晚上还挨门上户帮助群众识字，扫除文盲，对于孤寡老幼更是殷勤照顾。他们每到一地，就帮助山区人民筹办夜校、红专学校，建立小学、幼儿园、托儿所，办各种文化福利事业，开展文化娱乐活动。有些山区有长期流行的疾病，他们就帮助建立卫生所、医院和产院，帮助群众治病除害。
    干部关心群众，群众也热爱干部。广大群众称下放干部是“老红军”、“土改队”，他们热情地为下放干部送茶水，指引道路，帮助开发山区，有的甚至争着要下放干部住在他们家里。每逢年节，常请下放干部来家作客，像家人一样亲切。（附图片）
