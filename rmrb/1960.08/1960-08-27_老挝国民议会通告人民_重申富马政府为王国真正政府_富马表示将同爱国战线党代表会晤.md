Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 26th: Vientiane Radio broadcast today that the Lao National Assembly issued a notice to the people stating that the National Assembly held a meeting on the morning of the 25th. The meeting reiterated that Boun Oum Norasing had been elected Speaker of the National Assembly in accordance with procedures, and that the government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma was the true government of the Kingdom of Laos. According to the broadcast, thirty-four members of parliament attended the meeting.

According to another broadcast from Vientiane Radio today, former Lao Royal Government Prime Minister Chao Somsanith announced in a letter to Prince Phouma on the 22nd that he would hand over administrative power to the new government.

The National Assembly's meeting on the morning of the 25th also heard a report from Prime Minister Phouma on the results of his negotiations with former Chao Somsanith government Defense Minister Phoumi Nosavan in Savannakhet on the 23rd.

According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio on the 25th, Prime Minister Phouma and Royal Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Van Radi held two hours of negotiations with Phoumi Nosavan, and reached a consensus in principle on relations between the two sides.

The radio station, in discussing the background to the negotiations, said that because the Phouma government received a unanimous vote of approval from the National Assembly on August 17th, and subsequently, the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le unanimously agreed to immediately transfer administrative power to the new government, on the night of August 22nd, Phoumi Nosavan sent troops to occupy Beishan, and the Royal Armed Forces also dispatched troops to fight. In order to prevent bloodshed, Prince Phouma decided to hold negotiations with Phoumi Nosavan.

According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio today, Prime Minister Phouma stated in a letter to members of the Lao Patriotic Front that after the internal situation stabilizes, he will meet with representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front to discuss the implementation of the agreement signed in 1957 between the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Forces.

    新华社河内26日电　据万象电台今天广播，老挝国民议会向人民发出通告说，国民议会在25日上午举行了会议，会议再次重申，布文·诺拉辛已被国民议会按照手续选为国民议会议长；以梭发那·富马亲王为首相的政府是老挝王国的真正政府。据广播，出席这次会议的有三十四名议员。
    另据万象电台今天广播，前老挝王国政府首相昭·松萨尼特22日在他写给富马亲王的一封信中宣布把行政权力交给新政府。
    国民议会25日上午的会议还听取了富马首相关于他和前昭·松萨尼特政府国防部长富米·诺萨万23日在沙湾拿吉的谈判结果的报告。
    据万象电台25日广播，富马首相和王国军队总司令万·拉迪功曾经同富米·诺萨万举行了两小时的谈判，并且就双方的关系在原则上取得了一致的意见。
    这家电台在谈到双方谈判的背景时说，由于8月17日富马政府获得国民议会投票一致通过，随后，以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会一致同意把行政权力立即移交给新政府，8月22日夜里，富米·诺萨万派兵占领了北汕，王国军队也派出了部队进行战斗。为了制止流血事件的发生，富马亲王决定同富米·诺萨万举行谈判。
    据万象电台今天广播，富马首相在告老挝爱国战线党党员书中表示，在内部情况稳定以后，他将同老挝爱国战线党的代表会晤，讨论履行老挝王国政府同寮国战斗部队在1957年签订的协议的问题。
