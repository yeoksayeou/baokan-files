Comment on the South Korean Puppet "National Assembly Election"
By a staff commentator

The farce of the South Korean puppet "National Assembly election," directed single-handedly by U.S. imperialism, is nearing its end. Through this "election," the American master has put Chang Myon's "Democratic Party" in power to replace Syngman Rhee's "Liberal Party." One lackey of U.S. imperialism has collapsed in South Korea, and now another lackey is preparing to make his debut.

On the eve of and during the performance of this "election" farce in South Korea, the U.S. propaganda machine loudly boasted that "this is the freest election since the United Nations (i.e., the United States) created this republic (i.e., puppet regime) twelve years ago." The U.S. State Department also said that this "election" was "free and honest" and was conducted in a "free atmosphere," wanting people to believe that this "election" was fundamentally different from the previous "elections" carried out by the Syngman Rhee group. However, what effect can these lies have other than making people feel disgusted? The Syngman Rhee group's "election law" is still the blueprint for this so-called "election"; most of the "candidates" registered in this "election" are traitorous politicians, mainly from the upper echelons of the "Democratic Party," and most of them participated in the Syngman Rhee group's sham "elections." The upper-level reactionary group of the "Democratic Party" used all kinds of despicable and shameless means to win the "election." The "election expenses" they used to buy votes amounted to tens of billions of hwan, which was more than the money spent by the Syngman Rhee group in the "election" on March 15 this year. The "Democratic Party" also accepted bribes of 1.8 billion hwan in the name of "election expenses." The "Democratic Party" used a large amount of money to buy off henchmen and some "voters" to cast votes two or three times, and also created tens of thousands of "ghost votes" using the names of dead people. Not only that, during the "election," the "Democratic Party" colluded with the Heo Jeong group to organize a large number of "police mobile units" in various places, implemented "extraordinary martial law" throughout South Korea, mobilized 34,000 police officers for "security," and dispatched 20,000 police officers to arrest more than 15,300 innocent people in various places. So-called "free and honest elections" are like this!

This "election" in South Korea, like the "election" on March 15, was planned single-handedly by U.S. imperialism, with the aim of once again deceiving the South Korean people in order to impose a new puppet rule of the United States on the South Korean people through a deceptive election. The "New York World-Telegram and Sun" had already bluntly admitted that "it is clear that it is in the interests of the free world (i.e., the United States) to have something reliable ready to replace an old regime when it collapses." And what U.S. imperialism considers "reliable" is obviously the "Democratic Party" of South Korea. As early as when the Syngman Rhee regime was overthrown by the South Korean people, the April 30 issue of the U.S. "Business Week" unabashedly said: "The United States will be happy to see the Democratic Party come to power. The party's domestic and foreign policies are largely the same as those of Lee's (Syngman Rhee's) Liberal Party, and it will continue to cooperate with the United States." Here, the clumsy feet of the Washington schemers are fully exposed. What "Liberal Party," what "Democratic Party," it's just a change of soup but not the medicine, they are all the same stuff, all are shameful tools used by U.S. imperialism to enslave the South Korean people and create tension and plot new wars in the Far East.

Facts show that U.S. imperialism is by no means reconciled to its failure in South Korea, nor will it easily and automatically get out of South Korea. Since the collapse of the Syngman Rhee group, U.S. imperialism immediately put forward the Heo Jeong "caretaker cabinet," which is actually controlled by the upper-level reactionary group of the "Democratic Party," and now, through plotting the conspiracy of sham elections, it has put a "legal" cloak on its new puppet. People can see very clearly that for several months, the American master has been trying its best to instigate the Heo Jeong group to play the trick of so-called "reforming the national administration," reorganizing and strengthening the puppet police organization, which had been paralyzed in the people's struggle, and carrying out large-scale arrests and suppression of South Korean patriotic people. At the same time, U.S. imperialism is stepping up military provocations in South Korea. After the visit of U.S. imperialism boss Eisenhower to South Korea, from July 1, the U.S. troops invading Korea held a fifteen-day "hypothetical war" exercise as a war preparation measure; on July 9, a shooting exercise of launching "Honest John" rockets and atomic simulation bombs was held on the training ground of the U.S. 7th Division north of Seoul; in mid-July, the United States sent 8,000 more soldiers to South Korea to strengthen the strength of the U.S. troops invading Korea; in late July, U.S. military aircraft and U.S. warships intruded into northern Korea to carry out armed provocations... Recently, U.S. imperialism and the Heo Jeong group sang in chorus, clamoring for war. General Magruder, commander-in-chief of the U.S. troops invading Korea, openly clamored that there was a possibility of "another Korean War." Heo Jeong then clamored that South Korea was "ready at any time to support the cause of the free world, regardless of the nature of the war, regardless of where the battlefield is." The series of crazy military provocations and war cries carried out by U.S. imperialism are clearly aimed at intimidating the South Korean people and supporting its new lackey rule in South Korea.

However, the heroic South Korean people, who have been tempered in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee dictatorial rule, cannot be intimidated or deceived. The South Korean people are increasingly clearly aware that no matter which American lackey comes to power, the people will not have a good life. Therefore, for several months, their struggle has not only not stopped, but has developed even more deeply. They shouted loud and powerful slogans such as "Neither the Liberal Party nor the Democratic Party is a good thing," "All reactionary politicians step down," "Heo Jeong step down," and "U.S. Ambassador McConaughy get out immediately," further strengthening the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. And the "election" farce directed once again by U.S. imperialism in South Korea has aroused great anger among the South Korean people. Since July 29, large-scale mass demonstrations have erupted one after another in dozens of places, including Seoul, Masan, Busan, Daejeon, Daegu, Sacheon, and Goseong. Tens of thousands of demonstrators, regardless of the suppression by the puppet authorities, burned "ballot boxes," shouted "The Liberal Party-style election has appeared again," and demanded that the "election be declared invalid." On August 8, a mass demonstration took place in front of the "National Assembly Building" in Seoul, and two young people wrote slogans with their own blood, demanding that the fake assemblymen get out!

The matter is very clear, no matter what tricks the United States plays, no matter what kind of lackeys it replaces, it cannot deceive people. As long as U.S. imperialism does not get out of South Korea for a single day, the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people will not stop for a single day.

    评南朝鲜伪“国会选举”
    本报评论员
    由美帝国主义一手导演的南朝鲜伪“国会选举”丑剧，已近尾声了。通过这次“选举”，美国主子把张勉的“民主党”扶上台来，以代替李承晚的“自由党”。美国帝国主义在南朝鲜的一个走狗垮台，现在另一个走狗正准备粉墨登场了。
    在南朝鲜这次“选举”丑剧上演前夕和上演期间，美国宣传机器大肆吹嘘说，“这是联合国（即美国）在十二年前创立这个共和国（即傀儡政权）以来的最自由的一次选举”。美国国务院也说这次“选举”是“自由和诚实的”，是在“自由的气氛中进行的”，要人们相信这次“选举”根本不同于李承晚集团搞的历次“选举”。但是，这些谎话除了令人作呕之外，还能够起什么作用呢？李承晚集团的“选举法”仍然是这次所谓“选举”的蓝本；在这次“选举”中登记的“候选人”大部分是以“民主党”上层分子为主的卖国政客，他们大都参加过李承晚集团的伪“选举”。“民主党”上层反动集团为了在“选举”中获胜，用尽了一切卑鄙无耻的手段。他们用来收买选票的“选举费”达数百亿圜之巨，比李承晚集团在今年3月15日的“选举”中所花的钱还要多。“民主党”更以“选举费”名义受贿十八亿圜。“民主党”用大量金钱收买狗腿子和部分“选民”投两次、三次票，还用死人名字制造了数以万计的“幽灵选票”。不仅如此，在“选举”期间，“民主党”串通了许政集团在各地组织大批“警察机动队”，在南朝鲜全境实行“非常戒严”，动员三万四千名警察进行“戒备”，并出动两万名警察在各地逮捕了一万五千三百多名无辜人民。“选举”开始后至少有十七个郡发生了血腥镇压的暴行。所谓“自由和诚实的选举”，就是这样的！
    这次南朝鲜的“选举”也和3月15日的那次“选举”一样，是美帝国主义一手策划的，目的是为了再一次欺骗南朝鲜人民，以便把美国的新的傀儡统治，通过欺骗性的选举，强加在南朝鲜人民头上。“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”早就露骨地承认，“明摆着的事情，就是当一个老的政权垮台的时候，准备好一个可靠的东西来代替它是符合自由世界（即美国）的利益的。”而美国帝国主义所认为的“可靠的东西”显然就是南朝鲜的“民主党”。早在李承晚政权被南朝鲜人民推倒的时候，4月30日的美国“商业周刊”就曾毫不掩饰地说：“美国将高兴看到（南朝鲜）民主党上台。该党的国内外政策绝大部分同李（承晚）的自由党一样，而且它将继续同美国合作”。这里，华盛顿阴谋策划者的马脚就毕露无遗了。什么“自由党”，什么“民主党”，换汤不换药，都是一样的货色，都是美国帝国主义用来奴役南朝鲜人民和在远东制造紧张局势、策划新战争的可耻的工具。
    事实表明，美帝国主义决不甘心于它在南朝鲜的失败，也决不会轻易地自动地从南朝鲜滚出去。自从李承晚集团垮台以后，美帝国主义立即抬出了实际上由“民主党”上层反动集团掌握实权的许政“看守内阁”，而现在又通过策划伪选的阴谋，使它的新傀儡披上了一件“合法”的外衣。人们看得很清楚，几个月来，美国主子竭力唆使许政集团玩弄所谓“刷新国政”的把戏，重新整顿和加强在人民斗争中陷于瘫痪的傀儡警察机构，对南朝鲜爱国人民进行了大规模的逮捕和镇压。同时，美帝国主义在南朝鲜加紧进行军事挑衅活动。在美帝国主义头子艾森豪威尔“访问”南朝鲜以后，从7月1日起侵朝美军举行了为期十五天的作为准备战争措施的“假想战争”演习；7月9日在汉城北面的美军第七师练兵场上又举行了发射“诚实的约翰”式火箭和原子模拟弹射击演习；7月中旬美国增派八千名士兵到南朝鲜去加强侵朝美军的兵力；7月下旬美国军用飞机、美国军舰侵入朝鲜北部进行武装挑衅……。最近美帝国主义和许政集团一唱一和，叫嚣战争。侵朝美军总司令马格鲁德公开叫喊有“发生另一次朝鲜战争”的可能。许政则叫嚷说，南朝鲜“随时准备支持自由世界的事业，不管战争的性质如何，不管战场在什么地方。”美帝国主义进行的一系列疯狂的军事挑衅活动和战争叫嚣，显然是为了恐吓南朝鲜人民，支撑它在南朝鲜的新的走狗统治。
    但是，在反对美帝国主义和李承晚独裁统治的斗争中得到了锻炼的英勇的南朝鲜人民是恐吓不了，也欺骗不了的。南朝鲜人民日益清楚地认识到，无论哪一个美国走狗上台，都没有人民的好日子过。因此，几个月来，他们的斗争不仅没有停止，反而更加深入地发展了。他们喊出“自由党、民主党都不是好东西”、“一切反动政客滚下台”、“许政滚下台”以及“美国麦康瑙吉大使立刻滚蛋”等响亮有力的口号，进一步加强了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。而美帝国主义在南朝鲜又一次导演的“选举”丑剧，更激起了南朝鲜人民的巨大的愤怒。从7月29日以来，汉城、马山、釜山、大田、大丘、三千浦、高城等几十个地方此起彼伏地爆发了大规模群众示威。数以万计的示威群众，不顾傀儡当局的镇压，烧毁“投票箱”，高呼“又出现了自由党式的选举”，要求“宣布选举无效”。8月8日汉城的“国会大厦”前又发生了群众示威，两个青年用自己的血写下了口号，要求伪议员滚开！
    事情很明白，不管美国玩弄什么样的花招，换上什么样的走狗，都是欺骗不了人的。只要美帝国主义一天不滚出南朝鲜，南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争也就一天不会停止。
