    Cadres Take the Lead, Everyone Grows Vegetables
    By Our Correspondent
    Ma Youcai, the Party Branch Secretary, and Deng Lianxin, the Production Team Leader, of the Shangmajia Production Team in the Sanjiaji People's Commune, Hezheng County, Gansu Province, work diligently, deeply, and practically. This excellent style of work is concentratedly manifested in the production team's leadership and mobilization of the masses to grow vegetables. This spring, the Shangmajia Production Team mobilized commune members to grow vegetables on vacant land. Initially, a few cadres and commune members thought it was difficult to find land and were slow to take action.

    Party Branch Secretary Ma Youcai and Production Team Leader Deng Lianxin found a piece of land, totaling 3.7 mu, which was a stony hollow, and started working on it first. They used their time before and after meals and during windy and rainy weather to move stones, transport fertile soil, level the land, and plant pumpkins, cabbage, and radishes.

    After the leading cadres of the production team started working, the cadres of each work brigade couldn't sit still either. Deng Rugui, the leader of the Eighth Work Brigade, immediately gathered all the people in the work brigade and said, "The secretary and the team leader have started working, and we must also work." The cadres and masses of this work brigade used their spare time and vacant land to plant four mu of vegetables in two days. Ma Dejun, the leader of the Second Work Brigade, said to the cadres and members of his team, "Secretary Ma and Team Leader Deng have planted vegetables even in places with thousands of holes and eyes (very poor land). Our land here is better than that. What else can we say if we still complain about the lack of land to plant!" He also quickly took the deputy leader of the work brigade and the cook to look for vacant land and started planting vegetables. The Eleventh Work Brigade was close to the Second and Eighth Work Brigades. Seeing the two work brigades working hard, the cadres of this work brigade immediately mobilized the commune members to work hard as well. They also issued letters of challenge to the Third and Seventh Work Brigades to start a vegetable-growing competition. With the cadres working seriously, the masses also followed suit. Cooks, administrators, feeders, health workers, nursery workers, teachers, and students all came to grow vegetables. Even the elderly in the home for the elderly and the children in the kindergarten started growing vegetables. A wave of team-by-team vegetable planting, dining-hall vegetable planting, household-by-household vegetable planting, and everyone-vegetable planting emerged throughout the team.

    After the large-scale vegetable planting work began, the team also absorbed some work brigade leaders, administrators, cooks, and commune members to form an inspection team and launched a large-scale vegetable planting inspection and evaluation. In this way, the quality of vegetable planting was very good. Ma Zhonglin, the leader of the Fifteenth Work Brigade, saw that the First Work Brigade had planted vegetables on vacant land such as idle fields and corners of walls during the inspection and ran back to his team to introduce the experience, mobilizing commune members to continue to plant a large number of vegetables on idle fields and corners of walls. The entire production team's inspection activity lasted for four days, and the vegetable planting area increased by nearly one-fold compared to the original. Each work brigade planted vegetables on vacant land in front of and behind villages and houses. Commune members also planted vegetables in their yards. Some commune members even took out pots, cans, and wooden boxes from their homes to plant vegetables.

    After the masses were mobilized, the leading cadres of the production team went deep into the work brigades, public canteens, and among the masses to solve specific problems in vegetable planting and lead the vegetable planting work steadily forward. According to natural conditions, the Party branch divided the sixteen work brigades into three areas and assigned six branch committee members to the areas to specifically lead the vegetable planting work. At the same time, forty-two Party members and twenty-four League members were organized to go deep into the homes of commune members, understand their difficulties, and help solve them by adopting a household-contracting method. All the team cadres went especially deep into the backward teams and poor commune members, listened to their opinions, and paid attention to solving their difficulties. The Thirteenth Work Brigade was located in a dry mountainous area, and some people believed that there was a shortage of water and that a large number of vegetables could not be grown. Comrade Deng Lianhua, the deputy secretary of the Party branch, went deep into this work brigade, presented the facts and reasoned with the commune members, and took the lead in carrying water to mobilize them to plant a large number of vegetables. Later, he helped them solve the seed difficulty and finally promoted the solid development of vegetable planting work in this work brigade.

    The cadres of the Shangmajia Production Team closely linked each step of the vegetable planting work and deepened it step by step. After the vegetables were planted, the team cadres organized forces to go deep into the fields to vigorously grasp the field management of vegetables. In late March, the team cadres discovered that some vegetable leaves in the First and Sixth Work Brigades had soil fleas and immediately organized a professional team to spray them with 666 powder to kill the soil fleas. After the vegetables in the Tenth Work Brigade emerged, the leaves were yellowish and not strong. Comrade Ma Youcai, the secretary of the Party branch, immediately studied with the old farmers and found that it was mainly due to the lack of fertilizer. The production team did not have fertilizer at that time. Ma Youcai also discussed with the work brigade cadres and old farmers and proposed four solutions: first, use the public canteen's pot stoves and flue holes to produce fertilizer; second, organize old men to pick up manure; third, organize large carts to pull manure at the Nanling Canal water conservancy construction site; fourth, dismantle old stoves to replace new stoves. The entire team accumulated about 80,000 jin of fertilizer in half a month, and topdressed all the vegetable land once, and the vegetable seedlings gradually turned from yellow to green.

    The great development of vegetables in the entire team has brought about great improvements in life, great consolidation of the canteen, and great development of production. Now, when you come to this production team, you can see patches of vegetables in every work brigade, growing plump stems and thick leaves, which are very pleasing. In each public canteen, you can see large piles of fresh vegetables and long strings of dried vegetables. In recent times, the team has not been able to finish eating the vegetables it has grown and has also sold some of them, earning more than 2,290 yuan in cash. The increase in vegetables not only saves grain and increases income, but also greatly improves the lives of commune members, who are extremely satisfied with the large-scale planting of vegetables.

    干部带头  人人种菜
    本报记者
    甘肃省和政县三甲集人民公社上马家生产队党支部书记马有财、生产队长邓连信，工作艰苦深入，踏实细致。这种优良的作风，集中表现在生产队领导和发动群众种菜的工作上。上马家生产队今春发动社员利用空闲地种菜。开初，有少数干部和社员认为土地难找，迟迟不见行动。
    党支部书记马有财和生产队长邓连信，便找了一块地，首先动手干起来。这块地共有三亩七分，是一个石头窝。他两个利用饭前、饭后和刮风下雨时间，搬石头，运肥土，平整土地，种上了蕃瓜、白菜和萝卜。
    生产队领导干部动手干起来后，各个作业队的干部也坐不稳了。第八作业队队长邓如贵马上把全作业队的人召集起来，说：“书记、队长都干开了，咱们也要干。”这个作业队的干部和群众利用空闲时间，利用空闲地，两天就种菜四亩。第二作业队队长马得俊对本队干部和社员们说：“马书记、邓队长把千窟窿万眼睛的地方都种上了菜，我们这里的地都比那个地方好，若再喊叫缺地种，还有什么说的！”也连忙带上作业队副队长、炊事员，寻找空闲地，动手种起菜来。第十一作业队离第二、第八作业队近，这个作业队的干部见那两个作业队大干起来，立即发动社员也大干起来，他们还向第三、第七等作业队发出战书，展开种菜竞赛。干部都认真干起来，群众也跟着行动起来了。炊事员、管理员、饲养员、保健员、保育员、教员、学生都来种菜，甚至连敬老院的老人和幼儿园的娃娃也都种起菜来。全队出现了队队种菜、堂堂（食堂）种菜、家家种菜、人人种菜的热潮。
    大种蔬菜工作开始以后，队里又吸收一部分作业队长、管理员、炊事员和社员，组成检查组，开展了种菜大检查、大评比。这样蔬菜种的质量很好。第十五作业队队长马中林在第一作业队检查时，见这个队把闲场、墙角等空闲地都种上了菜，便跑回队里介绍经验，动员社员利用闲场、墙角等空闲地，继续大量种植蔬菜。全生产队检查活动共进行了四天，蔬菜播种面积就比原来增加了近一倍。各个作业队都将村前村后、房前屋后的空闲地种上了菜，社员也都在院子里种上菜，有的社员还把家里的盆盆、罐罐和木箱也拿出来种上菜。
    当群众行动起来之后，生产队领导干部又深入到作业队、公共食堂和群众中，解决种菜中的具体问题，领导种菜工作踏踏实实向前发展。党支部按照自然条件，把十六个作业队划分为三个片，将六个支部委员分配到片，具体领导种菜工作。同时，又把四十二个党员和二十四个团员，采用分户包干的办法，组织他们深入到社员家里，了解困难，帮助解决困难。全队干部都特别深入到后进队和贫困社员当中，听取他们的意见，注意解决他们的困难。第十三作业队地处干旱山区，一些人认为缺水，不能大量种菜。党支部副书记邓连华同志便深入到这个作业队，向社员摆事实、讲道理，并带头担水，发动他们大量种植蔬菜。以后又帮助他们解决种子困难，终于促使这个作业队种菜工作扎扎实实地开展起来。
    上马家生产队的干部对种菜工作环环扣紧，步步深入。蔬菜种上以后，队干部又组织力量，深入田间，大抓蔬菜的田间管理工作。3月下旬，队干部发现第一、第六作业队的一些蔬菜叶上出现了土跳蚤，立即组织专业队，用六六六药粉喷撒一遍，扑灭了土跳蚤。第十作业队蔬菜出苗后，叶子黄丝丝地很不壮实。党支部书记马有财同志即刻与老农研究，发现主要是因为缺少肥料。这个生产队当时又没有肥料，马有财又与作业队干部、老农一道商量，提出了四条解决办法：一是利用公共食堂锅灶、烟洞熏肥；二是组织老汉拾粪；三是组织大车到南岭渠水利工地拉粪；四是拆旧炕换新炕。全队在半个月内，就积肥约八万斤，给全部蔬菜地追肥一次，菜苗逐渐由黄转绿。
    全队蔬菜大发展，带来了生活大改善，食堂大巩固，生产大发展。现在，当你来到这个生产队，不论走进哪个作业队里，都可瞧见一片一片的蔬菜，长得茎肥叶粗，让人喜爱。到每个公共食堂里，都可看见一大堆一大堆的鲜菜和一长串一长串的干菜。全队在最近一段时间内，种的菜吃不完，还出售一部分，收入现金二千二百九十多元。蔬菜增多，不但节约粮食，增加收入，还大大改善了社员生活，社员们对大量种植蔬菜极为满意。
