    Peacock Displaying Its Feathers
    Yunnan is the province with the most diverse ethnic minorities in China. In the long-term hard work of jointly building the motherland, all ethnic groups have also created their own unique and diverse cultures. When you stroll along the Lancang River or the Ruili River, you will hear melodious Dai songs coming from bamboo houses; when you climb the Gaoligong Mountains and the Bilo Snow Mountains, you will hear the majestic and passionate Lisu songs; during the Torch Festival and the 3rd Month Fair, you will hear the Yi and Bai compatriots singing festival tunes; during the days when the terraced fields on the west bank of the Red River are filled with golden waves, you will hear the Hani people singing harvest songs. In the history of Chinese literature, Cao Zijian's ability to compose a poem in seven steps is a widely circulated story, but which Dai "Zanha" (singer) doesn't create poetry on the spot when inspired by the scenery? There are more than 1,300 such talented poets in Xishuangbanna alone. Long-standing epics such as the Naxi epic "Creation Epic," the Yi epic "Meige," and the Axi epic "Axi's Ancestors" are all excellent works. Yunnan is truly an ocean of poetry.
    Yunnan is not only an ocean of poetry but also a world of mythology. The Dai people use iron pens to write on "Baiye Sutras" on palm leaves, which are said to number 84,000 volumes. The Naxi people have also written as many as 3,000 volumes of Doba scriptures in hieroglyphic writing. In these vast scriptures, many beautiful and moving stories, legends, fairy tales, and fables are preserved. However, most ethnic minorities in Yunnan do not have written languages or their writing systems are extremely incomplete. Therefore, only a small portion of these stories are recorded in writing. The vast majority of legends and stories are passed down orally. For example, in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture between Cangshan Mountain and Erhai Lake, almost every mountain, river, grass, and tree has a wonderful legendary story associated with it.
    However, as an Yi folk song sings, "There are tens of thousands of Yi folk songs, buried deep in the soil in the past. The Communist Party came to dig them up, and they leaped to the ninth heaven." The real prosperity of ethnic minority literature in Yunnan has come in socialist times. As early as the early days of liberation when everything was waiting to be done, the Yunnan Party committees at all levels included the excavation and compilation of ethnic minority literature in their plans. Over the past ten years, three large-scale excavation and compilation efforts have been carried out throughout the province. Among them, the one in 1958 had the largest number of participants, the widest scope, and the longest duration. The provincial organs, cultural groups, and universities alone sent 114 people to participate in the investigation, and autonomous prefectures and counties successively dispatched more than 100 cadres and translators to participate in this work. They went deep into the most remote ethnic minority villages and lived, ate, and worked with the masses. In the course of working and living together, the investigation team members established deep feelings with the masses and became their confidants. Therefore, the investigation work received the active support and enthusiastic help of people of all ethnic groups, forming a mass "folklore collection" movement.
    When the investigation team went to the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture to collect the Dai narrative poem "E'bing and Sangluo," which opposes the feudal system, the Dai people were initially unwilling to tell the story because the feudal rulers had previously listed it as a forbidden book, threatening, "Whoever tells this story will have bad luck for three years." Later, the investigation team members lived in the home of an elderly Dai man named Pa Jiahe Huang, worked and lived with him, and after getting to know each other well, the old man took the initiative to tell the investigation team members the story of "E'bing and Sangluo" whenever he had time. Another Dai elder named En Heng led the investigation team members for a whole day and finally found this rare copy. When the investigation team went to the Xishan area where the Axi people lived to collect the epic "Axi's Ancestors," they heard that the blind singer Pan Zhengxing was the most familiar with this epic. They lived in the blind singer's home, helping the old man carry water, sweep the floor, and take the old man to the cafeteria for meals, serving him food and picking out vegetables for him, just like a son taking care of his father. The old man was very moved and tirelessly sang "Xianji" for the investigation team late into the night. In addition to reciting the entire epic, which is several thousand lines long, he also translated it all into Chinese. When the investigation team was working in the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, the Yi people composed a song that sang, "In the past, we sang on the high mountains, and the songs were blown away by the wind; in the past, we sang by the river, and the songs were washed away by the water; today we sing, and Chairman Mao has sent people to collect them!" The singer Li Shenhu sang the Yi epic "Meige" for the investigation team for eight days and eight nights. Due to the adoption of the mass line investigation method, the investigation team completed the work that could not be completed in the past few years in more than half a year. They collected more than 400,000 pieces of literary works and literary materials from the Bai, Naxi, Dai, Yi, Zhuang, Miao, Hani, Lisu, Yao, and Mongolian ethnic groups, and compiled the first drafts of the above-mentioned ethnic groups' folk songs, folk tales, narrative poems, and other selected collections, totaling about five million words, and compiled and published several huge epics and long poems such as "Creation Epic," "Meige," "Axi's Ancestors," "E'bing and Sangluo," and "Gourd Letter."
    The large-scale excavation and compilation of traditional ethnic minority literature directly promoted the development of socialist literature in various ethnic minorities. The pearls of the old era regained their light and inspired the people of the new era. Many singers who had been silent for many years could not help but sing about the new life of today. Thus, after the Great Leap Forward began in 1958, a mass movement of singing new folk songs appeared among the people of all ethnic groups in the province, and tens of thousands of new folk songs were created by various ethnic groups. These new folk songs all used traditional ethnic forms to sing about the brand-new content of the leap forward of all ethnic groups towards socialism at a speed that crossed several centuries in one step.
    Many old singers also felt that singing old tunes alone was not enough, and they eagerly demanded "new branches from old trees." Under the party's meticulous care and the inspiration of the boiling reality, the old singers' creative fire burned fiercely. Kang Langying, a famous Dai singer in Xishuangbanna, suffered from the oppression of the chieftain and the suffering of life before liberation. He was so angry that he closed his beautiful singing voice and remained silent for fifteen years. In 1956, the feudal lord system was abolished in Xishuangbanna. In 1958, he personally participated in the construction of the Liusha River Reservoir. He saw with his own eyes that the Dai people had realized the wishes that their ancestors had been unable to realize for generations with their own strength, so that the dry land for thousands of years was irrigated, and the responsible comrades of the county party committee personally encouraged him to create. Kang Langying could no longer remain silent. Taking water conservancy projects as the theme, he wrote "The Song of the Liusha River," the first Yunnan ethnic minority long poem praising the socialist leap forward. Kang Langshuai, another famous Dai singer, wrote "The Song of the Dai People," a long poem reflecting the tremendous changes in the Dai area in ten years. After the appearance of these works, which can be called the foundation stones of Yunnan ethnic minority socialist literature, they greatly encouraged the confidence of the people of all ethnic groups in developing their own new socialist literature. When "The Song of the Liusha River" was published, the Dai "Zanha" of Menghai in Xishuangbanna gathered in front of Kang Langying's bamboo house to dance and sing in celebration. They engraved this poem on the "Baiye Sutra" and held a "poetry competition" for singers throughout the county. They quickly created 21 long poems, all praising the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune.
    The people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan like to use peacocks to compare the most beautiful things. Yunnan's ethnic folk literature is like a peacock, but it did not spread its tail in the past. Bathed in the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, the peacock is now displaying its feathers. Its golden and radiant feathers add a few more colors to the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland.

    孔雀开屏
    云南，是我国少数民族种类最多的一个省。各民族在共同缔造祖国的长期辛勤劳动中，同时也创造了自己独特而多采的文化。当你漫步在澜沧江畔，瑞丽江边，你会听见从竹楼里传出悠扬婉转的傣歌；当你登上高黎贡山和碧罗雪山，你会听见那雄壮激昂的傈僳歌；在火把节里，在3月街上，你会听见彝族和白族同胞唱起节日的调子；在红河西岸梯田里金浪翻滚的日子里，你会听到哈尼人唱起丰收的酒歌。在我国文学史上，曹子建七步成诗，传为千古佳话，可是傣族的“赞哈”（歌手），哪一个不是见景生情、出口成诗？这样的天才诗人，仅西双版纳一地就有一千三百多人。流传久远的长诗如纳西族的史诗“创世纪”、彝族的史诗“梅葛”、阿细人的史诗“阿细的先基”，都是优秀的作品。云南真是一个诗歌的海洋。
    云南不仅是诗歌的海洋，也是神话的世界。傣族人民用铁笔刻写在贝树叶上的“贝叶经”，号称有八万四千卷，纳西族人民用象形文字书写的多巴经也达三千卷之多。在这些浩瀚的经帙中，保存着许多美丽动人的故事、传说、童话、寓言等。但是，云南大部分少数民族是没有文字或文字极不完备的，因此见于文字记载的只是其中很少部分，绝大部分的传说故事流传在人民的口头上，例如在苍山洱海之间的大理白族自治州，几乎一山一水、一草一木，都流传着一段美妙的传说故事。
    但是，正如一首彝族民歌所唱的：“彝族民歌万万千，过去深埋土中间，共产党来挖开土，一跃冲上九重天。”云南少数民族文学真正的繁荣，还是在社会主义的今天。早在解放初期百废待举的时候，云南各级党委就把发掘和整理少数民族文学的工作列入了规划。十年来，在全省范围内开展了三次大规模的发掘和整理工作。其中，以1958年的一次人数最多，范围最广，时间也最长。仅省级机关，文化团体和高等学校参加调查的就有一百一十四人，各自治州、县又先后抽调了一百多个干部和翻译人员参加这项工作。他们深入到最偏僻的少数民族村寨，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动。在共同劳动和生活中，调查队员与群众建立了深厚感情，成了他们的知心朋友。因此，调查工作得到各族群众的积极支持和热情的帮助，形成了群众性的“采风”运动。
    当调查队到德宏傣族景颇族自治州搜集傣族反封建制度的叙事诗“娥并与桑洛”时，开始傣族群众不肯讲，因为过去封建统治者把这列为禁书，威吓说：“谁讲了这个故事要倒霉三年”。后来，调查队员住在傣族老人帕戛贺幌的家里，同他一起劳动和生活，相处熟了以后，这个老人一有空就主动向调查队员讲
  “娥并与桑洛”的故事；另一个傣族老人嗯哼带着调查队员整整跑了一天，终于找到了这个珍罕的抄本。调查队到阿细人聚居的西山区搜集史诗“阿细的先基”时，听说盲歌手潘正兴老人对这部史诗最熟悉，他们就住在盲歌手家中，帮老人挑水、扫地，吃饭时牵老人到食堂，替他盛饭拈菜，像儿子照顾父亲一样。老人非常感动，深夜不倦地为调查队唱“先基”，他除把这部长达几千行的史诗全部背诵出来以外，还全部译成汉语。调查队在楚雄彝族自治州工作时，彝族人民编了一首歌唱道：“过去我们在高山唱歌，歌声被风吹走了；过去我们在河边唱歌，歌声被水冲走了；今天我们唱歌，毛主席派人来收集了！”歌手李申呼颇为调查队唱彝族史诗“梅葛”，整整唱了八天八夜。由于采取了群众路线的调查方法，调查队在半年多的时间内完成了过去几年不能完成的工作，共在白、纳西、傣、彝、僮、苗、哈尼、傈僳、瑶、蒙等民族中搜集到文学作品和文学资料四十多万件，编出了上述各民族的民歌、民间故事、叙事诗等选集的初稿共约五百多万字，整理出版了“创世纪”、“梅葛”、“阿细的先基”、“娥并与桑洛”和“葫芦信”等几部巨大的史诗和长诗。
    大规模发掘和整理少数民族传统的文学，直接促进了各少数民族社会主义文学的发展。旧时代的珍珠重放光明，鼓舞了新时代的人，许多沉默了多年的歌手禁不住要放声歌唱今天的新生活。于是，1958年大跃进开始后，在全省各族人民中出现了一个大唱新民歌的群众运动，各民族创作的新民歌数以万计。这些新民歌都是用传统的民族形式，唱出了各民族以一步跨过几世纪的飞跃速度向社会主义迈进的崭新内容。
    许多老歌手也感到光唱老的调子不够了，他们迫切要求“老树出新枝”。在党的无微不至的关怀和沸腾的现实生活激励下，老歌手创作之火熊熊地燃烧起来。西双版纳有个著名的傣族老歌手康朗英，在解放前受尽土司的压迫和生活的熬煎，他气愤得闭起了自己美妙的歌喉，一直沉默了十五年。1956年西双版纳废除了封建领主制度。1958年他亲自参加修建流沙河水库，他亲眼看到傣族人民用自己的力量实现了祖祖辈辈无法实现的愿望，使千百年干涸的田地得到了灌溉，县委负责同志又亲自鼓励他创作。康朗英再也沉默不下去了，他以水利工程为题材，写出了云南少数民族第一部歌颂社会主义跃进的长诗“流沙河之歌”。傣族另一个著名歌手康朗甩写出了反映傣族地区十年巨变的长诗“傣家人之歌”。这些可以称作云南少数民族社会主义文学奠基石的作品出现以后，大大鼓舞了各族人民发展自己社会主义新文学的信心。当
  “流沙河之歌”出版以后，西双版纳勐海的傣族“赞哈”齐集康朗英的竹楼前跳舞唱歌庆贺，他们把这部诗刻写在“贝叶经”上，并举行了全县歌手的“赛诗会”，很快便创作出二十一部长诗，全部都是歌颂总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的。
    云南各族人民喜欢用孔雀来比喻最美好的东西，云南的民族民间文学正像一只孔雀，但过去是没有开屏的。在毛泽东思想的阳光沐浴下，现在孔雀开屏了，她那金光闪闪彩霞一般的羽毛，为祖国多娇的江山又增添了几分颜色。
