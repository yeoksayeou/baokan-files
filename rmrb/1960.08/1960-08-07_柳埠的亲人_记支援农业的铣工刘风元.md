　　Kin of Liubu
　　——Remembering Milling Machine Operator Liu Fengyuan Supporting Agriculture
　　By our reporter Jiang Deming
　　Liu Fengyuan, a young milling machine operator from the Jinan Diesel Engine Factory, is such a quiet person that if you don't ask him a question, he will sit quietly beside you without saying a word.... He is usually taciturn, but he is a remarkable pioneer on the front line of supporting agriculture.
　　One clear morning, we took a car from Jinan to Liubu People's Commune in Licheng County. The Jinan Diesel Engine Factory began to establish contact with Liubu People's Commune last October. During this period, the farmers of Liubu established a close relationship with the workers of this factory. For example, we heard that the diesel engine factory once used several cars to support Liubu in rushing out the apricots accumulated in the mountain沟, while the people of Liubu once accidentally learned that the factory was having transportation difficulties, so they harnessed two large carts overnight to support the diesel engine factory. Although two large carts may not solve any major problems, the workers were particularly moved by the farmers' long-distance friendship. Usually, when trainees sent by Liubu to the factory to learn technology go home for vacation, many of them also bring the children of the master craftsmen to the countryside to play. The commune's cooks are also particularly energetic in boiling water and cooking for the workers whenever someone from the factory comes.
　　Coincidentally, on the day we came to Liubu, Liu Fengyuan, led by the secretary of the factory party committee, and several of his companions also came to Liubu. After the car stopped, I saw Liu Fengyuan and other workers carrying two new agricultural implements off the car, which were two universal weeding hoes. The secretary of the commune party committee was particularly interested in these two items. As soon as they were moved off the car, they were immediately taken to the cornfield by the village to try them out. In the field, the secretary of the commune party committee found a production team leader and several farmers. While he was driving the hoe himself, he discussed with everyone and solicited the opinions of the farmers. The secretary of the party committee of the diesel engine factory was also carefully observing behind. Liu Fengyuan looked so serious, constantly writing something in his notebook. Finally, the secretary of the commune party committee summarized everyone's opinions. The secretary of the factory party committee immediately replied that they would definitely make changes according to what the farmer brothers said after returning.
　　After testing the weeding hoe, Liu Fengyuan ran to the commune's farm tool repair factory. Here he has many newly acquainted friends, and some farmers who have just put down their hoes and picked up hammers are warmly surrounding him, asking this and that.
　　As early as mid-June of this year, there had been more than one hundred and fifty days without rain here. Commune members were carrying water up the mountain to water the fields, but the effect was very small. After watering two buckets of water, it would dry again after being exposed to the sun. Late that night, just as the drought resistance oath-taking meeting held by the commune on the South River beach was about to end, a burst of urgent motor sound came from the distance. This was the drought resistance team composed of workers from the diesel engine factory. Liu Fengyuan was also in this team. He got off the car and was assigned to inspect the machines in the farm tool factory.
　　Since the factory established contact with Liubu, Liu Fengyuan has lost count of how many times he has been to Liubu. He comes here as if he has arrived home. He runs to the workshop without even drinking a mouthful of water after getting off the car. He has to touch every machine in the repair workshop. Sometimes, before others can tell him what is wrong, he impatiently starts the machine to find the problem. For an experienced milling machine operator who is used to using lathes, he can quickly feel where the machine is not running smoothly. In order to repair the machines, he often works until late at night. Sometimes, after the lights are turned off, he and the workshop director light oil lamps to study and improve the tools. Before dawn, he simply lies on the same bed with the comrades from the farm tool factory for a while to sleep. During the tense days of drought resistance, Liu Fengyuan and his companions saw their farmer brothers carrying water up the mountain, and some irrigation and drainage machinery could not be used because of diesel engine failures, and the farmers could not repair them, so they had to be put aside. They were very anxious. Although they later repaired the faulty diesel engines, Liu Fengyuan was always thinking about this question: What if the machine fails again after we leave?
　　Once, Liu Fengyuan found that the waterwheel blanks of the commune's farm tool repair factory could not be processed because there was no milling machine, so he was embarrassed. Finally, he thought that it would be good if he could extract one of the few milling machines in the factory to give to the commune. However, the factory uses it to process thousands of tool bars every month. In order to solve this contradiction, he and his partner Yang Yaochuan and others boldly innovated after returning from Liubu and created "tool head welding," which increased the milling machine efficiency by three times, thus saving a milling machine to support the commune. This incident moved the farmer brothers to say, you are really our own brothers!
　　Liu Fengyuan is such a silent and practical person. He has many, many things in his mind, but he always appears so calm on the surface. But once he takes action, he is full of such a fiery energy, and he can't rest until the task is completed. Once he found that parts were missing in Liubu, which would affect the factory's production. He immediately set off back to Jinan. By the time he got off the car, it was almost dark. He rushed to the workshop without stopping, busy making parts for his brothers in Liubu. Early the next morning, he took these parts back to Liubu. While waiting for the car, he took the time to run to the Xinhua Bookstore to buy eight technical books. With the support of the factory party committee, he is planning to complete a long-considered wish—to systematically impart technical knowledge to farmer brothers. By the time he arrived in Liubu and helped them repair the machines, it was already late at night. Before going to bed, he handed those books to these friends. Early the next morning, Liu Fengyuan began to give everyone a drafting class.
　　Liu Fengyuan is known in the diesel engine factory as a selfless person who supports agricultural production; the farmer brothers in Liubu call him the kin of Liubu! In fact, there are many pioneers in the Jinan Diesel Engine Factory who, like Liu Fengyuan, resolutely listen to the Party's words and enthusiastically support agriculture. The secretary of the factory party committee immediately introduced us to many, many names.
　　On the morning of the day before we left Jinan, we went to the diesel engine factory to see Liu Fengyuan again. As soon as we entered the gate, we felt it was quiet, because it was their Sunday holiday. We thought of going to Liu Fengyuan's home, but the comrades in the factory party committee office said, don't go, don't expect to find him in the dormitory on a holiday. Let's go, let's go to the workshop to see, he never leaves the workshop even on holidays. As we were about to go out, a worker told us that Liu Fengyuan took advantage of today's holiday and went to Liubu early in the morning. It is said that he went to help the farmer brothers prepare autumn harvest tools.

    柳埠的亲人
    ——记支援农业的铣工刘风元	本报记者　姜德明
    济南柴油机厂的青年铣工刘风元是这样一个沉静的人，如果你不问他一句话，他会静静地坐在你的身旁不作一声……。他平时沉默寡言，但在支援农业的战线上却是成绩卓著的一名闯将。
    在一个晴明的早晨，我们乘车从济南出发到历城县柳埠人民公社去。济南柴油机厂跟柳埠人民公社是去年10月开始挂钩建立联系的，在这期间，柳埠的农民跟这个厂的工人们建立了亲密的关系。例如我们听说柴油机厂曾经用几辆汽车支援柳埠把积压在山沟里的杏子抢运出来，而柳埠的人们有一次偶然打听到厂里在运输发生困难的时候，便连夜套上两辆大车去支援柴油机厂。虽然两辆大车不一定能解决什么大问题，但是工人们对农民兄弟这种远道而来的情谊都分外感动。平时柳埠派到厂里学习技术的学员们放假回家时，很多人都把老师傅的孩子也带到乡下来玩。公社的炊事员，每逢厂里有人来，在给工人烧水做饭时也特别带劲。
    巧得很，我们来到柳埠这一天，刘风元在厂党委书记的带领下和他的几个同伴也来到了柳埠。车停后，我看到刘风元和别的工人抬着两台新式农具下了车，那是两台万能耘锄。公社党委书记对这两个物件分外感到兴趣，一从汽车上搬下来，就立刻拿到村边玉米地里去试用了。在地里，公社党委书记找来一位生产队长和几位农民，他一边亲自驾着锄，一边和大家研究着征求农民的意见。柴油机厂的党委书记也在后边仔细地观察着。刘风元显得那么认真，不时地在小本子上记着什么。最后公社党委书记归纳了一下大家的意见。柴油机厂的党委书记马上回答说，回去以后一定按照农民兄弟说的进行改制。
    试验完耘锄，刘风元就跑到公社农具修配厂来了。这里有他许多结识不久的朋友，一些刚刚放下锄头拿起锤头的农民们亲热地围着他说东问西。
    还是今年6月中旬，这里已经有一百五十多天没有落过雨了。社员们正一担担地挑着水上山浇地，但是效果很小，浇上那么两桶水，太阳一晒又干了。这天夜里很晚了，正当公社在南河滩上举行的抗旱誓师大会快要结束的时候，远处传来急促的马达声，这是柴油机厂工人组成的抗旱队伍来了。这队伍里也有刘风元。他下了车就被分派去检查农具厂的机器去了。
    自从厂里和柳埠挂钩之后，刘风元已经数不清一共到柳埠来过多少次了。他来到这里就像到了家里一样，下了汽车连口水也不喝就往车间里跑。修配车间里的几台床子他都要一台一台的摸个遍，有的时候来不及等待别人告诉他究竟什么地方有了毛病，他就性急地先开车找毛病了。对于一个使惯了车床的有经验的铣工来说，机器哪里不顺手他很快地就会感觉出来的。为了修理机器，他经常忙到深夜，有时电灯熄过之后，他还跟车间主任点起油灯研究改进工具。天明前随便和农具厂的同志们挤在一张床上躺一会儿就算睡了觉。在抗旱紧张的日子里，刘风元和他的同伴们看到农民兄弟一担担地往山上挑水，而有些排灌机械因为柴油机发生故障，农民不会修理，只好搁置不用，他们心里甚为焦急。虽然后来他们把有毛病的柴油机修理好了，但是刘风元却总思考着这样一个问题：如果我们走了，机器再发生故障怎么办？
    有一次，刘风元发现公社农具修配厂的水车毛坯，因为没有铣床不能加工，他就为难起来了。最后他想如果能把厂里仅有的几部铣床抽出一部给公社就好了。但是厂里每月有几千把刀杆用它来加工。为了解决这个矛盾，他从柳埠回来之后就和他的伙伴杨耀川等人大胆革新，创造了“刀头铸焊”，使铣床工效提高了三倍，从而节省出一部铣床支援了公社。这件事感动得农民兄弟们说，你们真是我们的亲兄弟啊！
    刘风元就是这样默默地实干的人，他心里想着许多许多的事情，表面上表现得又总是那么平静。但等他一旦行动起来的时候，却充满了那么一股火热劲，任务不完成，心总是放不下的。有一次他在柳埠发现零件缺少了，将要影响工厂的生产。他立即动身赶回济南。下了汽车天都快黑了，他马不停蹄地奔向车间，忙着给柳埠的兄弟们赶制零件。第二天一清早，他又带着这些零件赶回柳埠。趁着等汽车的时间，他又抽空跑到新华书店买了八册技术书籍。他在工厂党委的支持下，正想完成一个考虑了许久的愿望——把技术知识系统地传授给农民兄弟。等他到了柳埠并帮助他们修整好机器的时候，已经又是深夜了。临睡前，他把那些书籍递给这些朋友们。第二天清早，刘风元就开始给大家上制图课。
    刘风元在柴油机厂里被人称为支援农业生产而忘我的人；柳埠的农民兄弟则称他为柳埠的亲人！其实要想在济南柴油机厂找到像刘风元这样坚决听党的话，热心支援农业的闯将还有不少，工厂党委书记一下子就介绍给我们好多好多名字。
    临离济南的前一天的早晨，我们到柴油机厂想再见一下刘风元。一进大门就觉得显得静悄悄的，原来赶上了他们星期休假。我们想到刘风元的家里去，厂党委办公室的同志却说，别去了，放假的日子甭想在宿舍里能找到他。走，咱们往车间去看看吧，他从来都是假日也不离车间的。我们正要往外走，一位工人告诉我们，刘风元趁着今天是假日，一清早就往柳埠了。听说他是为了帮助农民兄弟准备秋收工具去的。
