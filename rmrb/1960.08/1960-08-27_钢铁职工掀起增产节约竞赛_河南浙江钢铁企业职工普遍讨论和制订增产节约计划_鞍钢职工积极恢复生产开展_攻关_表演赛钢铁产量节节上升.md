    Steel Workers Launch Production Increase and Thrift Campaign
    Henan and Zhejiang Steel Enterprise Workers Universally Discuss and Formulate Production Increase and Thrift Plans
    Anshan Iron and Steel Workers Actively Resume Production, Launch "Tackle Key Problems" Performance Competitions, Steel Output Rises Steadily

    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Dispatch: Under the excellent situation of the overall leap forward in production, the workers of the steel industry in Henan Province have launched a production increase and thrift movement to ensure the fulfillment and overfulfillment of this year's steel production plan.
    This year, steel production in Henan Province has been steadily increasing. The pig iron output for the first seven months has already caught up with the total output for the entire last year, and the output of steel and steel products has greatly increased compared to last year. From August 1st to 20th, the daily production level of pig iron increased by 7.65% compared to the same period in July, and steel increased by 10.53%.
    Recently, the workers of the province's steel industry universally reviewed the completion of the national plan for the first seven months and discussed and formulated production increase and thrift plans for the next four months. The steelmaking plant of Anyang Iron and Steel Company, from the entire plant to the workshops, teams, and individuals, has formulated specific measures for increasing production and economizing, as well as for completing the plan. They decided to tap the potential of equipment, extend the life of furnace linings, improve the charging equipment through technological innovation, implement mechanized loading and unloading, strengthen internal collaboration, deeply carry out competitions with fellow workers, launch mass economic accounting activities, comprehensively strengthen enterprise management, establish and improve various responsibility systems, and continue to have leading cadres go deep into the front lines to participate in production and lead production, determined to greatly improve the steel production level in August and September. The workers of Xinxiang No. 1 Steel Plant launched a "ten checks and ten comparisons" activity, including checking ideology, checking key production points, checking operating procedures, checking the promotion of advanced experiences, comparing advanced techniques, comparing thriftiness, comparing quality, and comparing safety. This boosted revolutionary enthusiasm, and workshops, teams, and individuals all formulated production increase and thrift targets and specific measures for the next four months. After the production increase and thrift plan was formulated, the entire plant immediately strengthened the work in the four key areas of coking, ore roasting, equipment maintenance, and furnace front operation, led by the Party Committee Secretary and members. Pingdingshan Iron and Steel Plant recently launched a competition between workshops, between shifts, between groups, between furnaces, and between individuals, and has exceeded the national plan on a daily basis. The daily pig iron production from August 15th to 18th increased by 41.8% compared to the average daily production in the first ten days of the month.
    In the production increase and thrift movement, leading cadres at all levels of steel enterprises went deep into the front lines, focused on the production of coking coal and ore, and concentrated superior forces to solve key problems in increasing production. In early August, more than 840 cadres directly under Henan Province, including more than 80 leading cadres from departments and bureaus, went deep into mines, coal, transportation, and steel production units to participate in production and lead production. After the leading cadres of Xinxiang area went deep into the front lines, they strengthened the increase in production and storage of raw materials and fuels, which led to a sharp increase in the daily output of ore, ensuring the needs of iron smelting. The leading cadres of Luoyang area went deep into the front lines, and while leading workers to increase the production of coking coal, they also conducted ideological education for iron smelting workers, teaching them to "love coal and coke as they love grain," and tried every means to save coal. The average coke consumption per ton of pig iron in this area in mid-August dropped to 0.8 tons, and the daily pig iron production level increased by 9% compared to the first ten days of the month.
    In the production increase and thrift movement, workers universally promoted new technologies and advanced experiences that have a significant impact on improving current production. Xuchang area is comprehensively and systematically promoting the advanced experience of Luhe No. 2 Steel Plant in matching small furnaces with large equipment. JiYuan County Manghe Steel Plant recently concentrated on the advanced experience of transforming indigenous blast furnaces from various places and carried out new technological transformations on the indigenous blast furnaces throughout the plant. Now, the production situation of the indigenous furnaces throughout the plant is very good. The utilization coefficient in August averaged 1.75, the pig iron qualification rate reached 93%, and the daily production level increased by 14% compared to July.

    This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 26th Dispatch: The steel front workers of Zhejiang Province are further carrying out a vigorous steel production increase and thrift campaign to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's steel production plan.
    After the People's Daily editorial "Immediately launch a production increase and thrift movement centered on grain and steel" was published, the Party committees of Banshan, Shaoxing, Xianlinbu, Huzhou and other steel plants successively convened enlarged meetings of the Party committee and cadre meetings, held mass meetings, and made mobilization reports to cadres and the masses at all levels; some factories also used wired broadcasts, blackboards and other propaganda tools to relay the contents of the editorial, so that the important significance of carrying out the production increase and thrift movement penetrated into the hearts of the people. The broad masses of steel workers were all high in fighting spirit, and immediately discussed it at the converter and blast furnace. The workers of Class A of the First Steelmaking Workshop of Banshan Steel Plant immediately revised the production increase plan for the second half of August, and decided to continue to improve the quality rate of steel ingots and increase the shift output.
    On the basis of raising ideological understanding, the mass movement of "compare, learn, catch up, and help" in various steel plants has been further developed. The workshops, sections, groups, and fellow workers of Banshan Steel Plant have launched linked competitions. The First Steelmaking Workshop set up Class C, which has high quality, high yield and low consumption, as a pacesetter, and organized operating skill performance competitions. Through the competition, the production of Class A and Class B approached the level of Class C. The competition movement among the furnaces of Shaoxing Steel Plant was also in full swing. On the 19th, the quality of pig iron in the whole plant won a full score, and the qualification rate reached 100%. In the production increase and thrift movement, various steel plants focused on the important link of fuel. In order to improve the quality of coke, the workers of Hugang Coking Workshop discussed and formulated operating systems for coal washing, crushing, etc., and the quality was improved, the ash content of coal washing was reduced by 3.24%, and the sulfur content was reduced by 0.21%.
    In order to lead the production increase and thrift movement well, leading cadres at all levels further improved their work style, went to the front line of production, worked and helped solve specific problems.

    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan Dispatch: The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, who overcame the flood disaster, after fully resuming production, immediately pooled their wisdom and efforts to sweep away the difficulties left by the flood, and set off a climax of the production increase and thrift movement centered on increasing steel production, and strive to quickly reach and exceed the steel production level before the flood.
    Now, the production level of each plant and mine of Anshan Iron and Steel is rising steadily. The ore supplied to the blast furnace by Dagushan, Donganshan and other iron mines has exceeded the amount supplied in late July—before the flood. The ironmaking workers overcame the obstacles caused by the temporary suspension of production due to the disaster, such as the solidification of the taphole and the unsmooth operation of the furnace, and quickly restored the normal production of the blast furnace. Good news of production has been continuously reported from the three major steelmaking plants. In the past week, the average smelting time of each furnace of steel in the Second Steelmaking Plant has been shortened by 23 minutes compared with July, and the hourly output has increased by 4%.
    In the vast factory area of ​​Anshan Iron and Steel, various types of tackling key problems and performance competitions are in full swing. The workers of the steelmaking plant launched a tackling key problems performance competition aimed at the key problem of the lengthening of steelmaking time caused by wet raw materials. The drivers of the charging machines in the Second Steelmaking Plant changed the method of loading and charging, using two charging machines to charge a single open hearth furnace at the same time, alternately drying the raw materials in the open hearth furnace first, and then pouring the molten steel into it, which not only shortened the steelmaking time, but also ensured the safety of the furnace. Anshan labor model, Ma Wanyang, secretary of the Youth League branch of Class A of the Second Steelmaking Plant, led a youth commando team to work early every day, attacking the key problem of the long furnace head fire and steelmaking time, creating conditions for further shortening the smelting time. Thanks to the hard work and ingenuity of the workers throughout the plant, in the past week, the smelting time of each furnace of steel has been shortened by 23 minutes compared with July.
    Blast furnace workers fought even more fiercely against the difficulties left by the flood. No. 4 blast furnace was attacked by the flood and was once shut down. After resuming production on the 14th, it encountered the obstacle of taphole solidification and failure to discharge molten iron when the first furnace of molten iron was discharged. Communist Party member and foreman Yang Yan and Communist Party members Liu Zhongfu and Li Shaowen immediately used oxygen to burn the taphole. If one bottle of oxygen could not burn it open, they burned another bottle. They used more than 100 bottles in total, and finally burned the taphole to normal, and the molten iron flowed smoothly, making the blast furnace production quickly recovered to the level before the flood.
    The raw materials used by the Anshan Iron and Steel Sintering Plant were wetted by rainwater, which affected the continued improvement of the output and quality of sintered ore. Faced with this difficulty, the workers offered suggestions and contributions. The batching personnel adopted methods such as frequently weighing the materials, frequently analyzing the raw material composition, and appropriately adding quicklime to the raw materials to ensure uniform batching. The sintering workers appropriately increased the air volume and increased the roasting temperature, so that the sintered ore was roasted thoroughly and well. From the 12th to the 21st, not only did the output of sintered ore in the whole plant reach the level of July, but also the iron content of the ore increased by 7.6% compared with July.
    After the flood, under the cordial care of the CPC Central Committee and the CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee, raw materials, fuels and materials from all over the country to support Anshan were continuously transported to Anshan. In order to send these raw materials and fuels to the blast furnaces, open hearth furnaces, and coke ovens in a timely manner, the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Transportation Department, together with the workers sent by brother factories and mines to support them, launched a massive competition of unloading and rapid unloading by ten thousand people, so that trains full of concentrate powder and coal were unloaded in a timely manner as soon as they arrived. In just two days, they unloaded all 500 cars of ore. (Attached picture)

    钢铁职工掀起增产节约竞赛
    河南浙江钢铁企业职工普遍讨论和制订增产节约计划
    鞍钢职工积极恢复生产开展“攻关”表演赛钢铁产量节节上升
    新华社郑州讯　河南省钢铁工业的职工，在生产全面跃进的大好形势下，展开了增产节约运动，保证完成和超额完成今年的钢铁生产计划。
    今年，河南省的钢铁生产一直不断地上升，头七个月的生铁已经赶上了去年全年的产量，钢和钢材都比去年产量增长很大。8月1日至20日，生铁日产水平比7月同期又增长7.65％，钢增长10.53％。
    最近，全省钢铁工业的职工普遍检查了前七个多月完成国家计划的情况，讨论和制订了今后四个多月的增产节约计划。安阳钢铁公司炼钢厂，从全厂到车间、小组、个人，都订出了增产节约计划和完成计划的具体措施。他们决定挖掘设备潜力，延长炉衬寿命，通过技术革新改进上料设备，实行装卸机械化，加强内部协作，深入开展同工种对手赛，开展群众性的经济核算活动，全面加强企业管理，建立和健全各种责任制度，领导干部继续深入第一线参加生产领导生产，决心使8、9月份的钢的生产水平大大提高一步。新乡第一钢铁厂的职工，展开了查思想、查生产关键、查操作规程、查先进经验推广和比先进、比节约、比质量、比安全等“十查十比”活动，鼓足了革命干劲，车间、小组、个人都订出了今后四个多月的增产节约指标和具体措施。在增产节约计划订出以后，全厂分别由党委书记、委员挂帅，立即加强了炼焦、矿石焙烧、设备维修、炉前操作四个重点环节的工作。平顶山钢铁厂最近开展了车间与车间、班与班、组与组、炉与炉、人与人之间的对手竞赛，按日超额完成了国家计划，8月15日至18日的生铁日产量，比上旬平均日产量提高41.8％。
    在增产节约运动中，钢铁企业的各级领导干部都深入第一线，抓紧焦煤、矿石生产，集中优势力量，解决增产中的关键问题。8月上旬，河南省直属机关已抽调出八百四十多名干部，其中包括厅、局长领导干部八十多人，分别深入矿山、煤炭、运输和钢铁生产单位，参加生产领导生产。新乡地区的领导干部深入第一线后，加强原料、燃料的增产和储备，使矿石的日产量猛增一倍，保证了炼铁的需要。洛阳专区的领导干部深入第一线，在领导职工增产焦煤的同时，对炼铁职工进行“爱煤、爱焦如爱粮”的思想教育，千方百计节约煤炭。这个专区8月中旬每吨生铁的焦耗量平均下降到了零点八吨，生铁日产水平比上旬提高9％。
    职工们在增产节约运动中，普遍推广一些对提高当前生产有重大作用的新技术和先进经验。许昌地区正在全面系统地推广漯河第二钢铁厂的小炉配大设备的先进经验。济源县漭河钢铁厂，最近集中了各地改造土高炉的先进经验，对全厂的土高炉进行了新的技术改造。现在，全厂土炉子的生产情况很好，8月份的利用系数平均达到了一点七五，生铁合格率达到93％，日产水平比7月份提高14％。
    本报杭州26日电　浙江全省钢铁战线职工进一步开展轰轰烈烈的钢铁增产节约运动，保证完成和超额完成今年的钢铁生产计划。
    “立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”的人民日报社论发表以后，半山、绍兴、闲林埠、湖州等钢铁厂党委先后召开党委扩大会议和干部会议，举行群众大会，向干部、群众层层作动员报告；有的厂还运用有线广播、黑板报等宣传工具，转播了社论内容，使开展增产节约运动的重要意义深入人心。广大钢铁工人个个斗志昂扬，马上在转炉边、高炉旁议论起来。半山钢铁厂第一炼钢车间甲班工人当即修订了8月下旬的增产计划，决定继续提高钢锭合格率和增加班产量。
    在提高思想认识的基础上，各钢铁厂的“比、学、赶、帮”的群众运动有了进一步发展。半山钢铁厂各车间、工段、小组和同工种之间开展了挂钩竞赛。第一炼钢车间树立了优质高产低耗的丙班为标兵，组织操作技术表演赛。通过竞赛，甲班和乙班的生产都接近了丙班的水平。绍兴钢铁厂各炉子的竞赛运动也开展得热火朝天，19日全厂生铁质量获得了满堂红，合格率达到100％。在增产节约运动中，各钢铁厂狠抓燃料这个重要环节。湖钢焦化车间职工为了提高焦炭质量，讨论制订了洗煤、破碎等操作制度，质量有了提高，洗煤灰分降低3.24％，硫分降低0.21％。
    为了把增产节约运动领导好，各级领导干部进一步改进作风，到生产第一线去，边劳动，边帮助解决具体问题。
    据新华社鞍山讯　战胜洪水灾害的鞍山钢铁公司职工，在全部恢复生产之后，立即群策群力，横扫洪水遗留下来的困难，掀起以增产钢为中心的增产节约运动高潮，力争钢产量迅速达到和超过水灾前的水平。
    现在，鞍钢各厂矿的生产水平正在节节上升。大孤山、东鞍山等铁矿每天供给高炉的矿石，已经超过7月下旬——水灾前供应的数量。炼铁工人们克服了因灾暂时停产而产生的出铁口凝结、炉况不顺行等障碍，使高炉生产迅速恢复正常。三大炼钢厂不断传出生产捷报，第二炼钢厂在最近一周里，平均每炉钢的熔炼时间比7月份缩短二十三分钟，小时产量增长4％。
    在鞍钢的广大厂区里，各种各样的攻关表演赛进行得轰轰烈烈。炼钢厂的工人针对原料潮湿致使炼钢时间延长的关键问题，展开了攻关表演赛。第二炼钢厂装料机的司机们，改变了装车加料的方法，用两部装料机同时给一座平炉加料，轮流着先在平炉里把原料烘干，然后再倒进钢水里去，这样既缩短了炼钢时间，又保证了炉子安全。鞍山劳动模范、第二炼钢厂甲班团支部书记马万样，率领青年突击队，每天都提前上班，猛攻因为炉头挡火、炼钢时间长的关键，为进一步缩短熔炼时间创造了条件。由于全厂职工苦干、巧干，最近一周来，每炉钢的熔炼时间已比7月份缩短了二十三分钟。
    高炉工人同洪水遗留下的困难斗争得更加激烈。四号高炉受到洪水袭击曾一度停产，14日恢复生产以后，出第一炉铁水时就遇到了出铁口凝结、铁水出不来的障碍。共产党员、工长杨彦和共产党员刘忠馥、李少文，立即用氧气烧出铁口，一瓶氧气烧不开，就再烧一瓶，一共使用了一百多瓶，终于把出铁口烧得正常，铁水畅流，使高炉生产迅速恢复到水灾前的水平。
    鞍钢烧结总厂使用的原料被雨水淋得很湿，影响了烧结矿产量和质量继续提高。在这个困难面前，职工们纷纷献策出力。配料人员采取勤秤料、勤分析原料成分，适当地在原料中掺生石灰等办法，保证配料均匀。烧结工人适当加大风量，提高了焙烧温度，使烧结矿烧得透、烧得好。从12日到21日，全厂烧结矿不仅产量达到了7月份的水平，矿石含铁量还比7月份提高了7.6％。
    洪水过后，在中共中央和中共辽宁省委的亲切关怀下，全国各地支援鞍钢的原料、燃料和材料源源运到鞍山。为了把这些原料、燃料及时送给高炉、平炉、焦炉，鞍钢运输部职工同兄弟厂矿派来支援的职工一起，开展了一个万人抢卸、快卸的大竞赛，使满载精矿粉、煤炭的列车，到达一列就及时卸完一列。他们在短短两天当中，就把五百车矿石全部卸完。（附图片）
