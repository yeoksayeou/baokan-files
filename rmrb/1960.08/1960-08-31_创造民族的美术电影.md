    Creating National Fine Arts Films
    Te Wei
    Fine arts film is a relatively young genre in China's film art. Over the past eleven years, it has experienced a growth process of "from scratch, from small to large, and rapid development." Especially since the Great Leap Forward, under the brilliant light of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's General Line, a new landscape of comprehensive leaps forward in thought, creation, production, and technology has emerged. Production has surged from an average of five films per year before 1958 to forty-seven films, with average costs reduced by 55%; filming time has been shortened by one-third, and the quality of films has also improved significantly. An even greater gain lies in breaking down superstitions, promoting a spirit of creation, and breaking through the subject matter of old fairy tales, folk stories, and myths, and filming films with modern themes such as the Great Leap Forward, children's lives, and political satire. At the same time, new genres, styles, forms, and techniques of fine arts films have also been created. In particular, the emergence of paper-cut films and ink-wash animation films has brought China's fine arts film development to a new stage, forming our nation's unique style. With the expansion of subject matter and the diversification of styles, the audience has also expanded. Fine arts films have become not only an important tool for educating children and cultivating communist successors, but also a weapon of ideological education that is "loved by everyone, young and old alike."

    After the Party's General Line for socialist construction was put forward, a situation of a Great Leap Forward appeared on the industrial and agricultural fronts, prompting most creators to have a strong desire to reflect real life and cooperate with the current political struggle. This strong desire converged into a huge force, and began to fiercely impact the old ideas and frameworks that believed that "fine arts films are difficult to reflect reality." A group of young comrades were particularly active. Under the combat call of the Party Central Committee to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in about fifteen years, they collectively wrote a political propaganda film, "Catching Up with Britain." When China successfully trial-produced reactive dyes, it immediately created "Wonderful Colors." At the same time, a number of films praising the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the heroic ambitions and soaring energy of the Chinese working people were also filmed, such as "Celebrating the Harvest" and "Singing the General Line." These films, both in content and form, are brand new and full of the spirit of the times. Subsequently, films such as "Little Carp Jumps Over the Dragon Gate," which expresses the spirit of striving for the top, "The Story in the Mural," which expresses the power of the people's commune, the determination to conquer nature, and the idea that man will conquer nature, and "The Little Agronomist," which dares to think, dare to do, and create miracles, appeared one after another. At the same time, a group of political satire films such as "Who Sings Best" and "Dove" were also filmed, becoming sharp weapons that combine the current international situation and strike at US imperialism. In March and April of this year, four fine arts films reflecting the technological revolution, such as "Sunny Spring" and "Innovation Addict," were created at high speed. In this way, the field of expression of fine arts films has been greatly expanded, and the ideological and combat effectiveness of fine arts films has been greatly improved. Through this series of practices, the question of "whether to reflect reality" has been resolved, and the question of whether realistic themes can give play to the characteristics of fine arts films has also been resolved through a large number of emerging "new fairy tale" genres of fine arts films. And it further clarified that our fantasy should be based on labor, and it is entirely possible to bring magical elements into reality, and we should also emphasize "more exaggeration and more fantasy" to express our socialist and communist revolutionary ideals.

    Animation and puppet films are an art form transplanted from abroad. In the early days, it was natural that China's fine arts films were more influenced by foreign countries. After eleven years, especially the exploration and creation of the two years of the Great Leap Forward, it has begun to have a more distinct national style. The puppet film "The Magic Brush" filmed in 1955 and "The Proud General" filmed in 1956 not only boldly absorbed and developed and created from China's traditional opera and plastic arts in the design and performance of characters and backgrounds, but also strived to have Chinese national characteristics in the characters' thoughts, feelings, living habits, movements, postures, and language. These two films have achieved good results in the exploration of national style and accumulated some experience. Everyone's understanding has been improved. And it has further encouraged and strengthened our ambition to climb the peak of proletarian art on the international film scene with a "unique" style. Under the leadership of old artists, a group of young comrades conducted in-depth research on China's folk art—paper-cutting, window grilles, and shadow puppetry, and created the first new genre, "paper-cut film." Paper-cutting, window grilles, and shadow puppetry, these traditional arts that are loved by the people, not only provide a strong national color in plastic arts, but also suggest the expression techniques and style patterns of shadow puppetry with different local characteristics and various schools. Once these beautiful art forms are combined with the characteristics of film, they will emit immeasurable artistic power and achieve good responses from audiences at home and abroad.

    Whenever we consider how to make animation, a foreign art form, have a more distinct national style, we will naturally think of our motherland's beautiful traditional painting art—ink painting. It is not only loved by the vast number of people in our country, but also occupies a unique position in the world's art scene. However, to make ink paintings move on the screen, there are many difficulties in technology and art. Many people believe that based on the technical level of our personnel, equipment conditions, and the poor foundation of Chinese painting among creators, it is impossible to solve it in the short term. Some people even believe that making ink paintings into animation is just a beautiful fantasy, this fantasy is very tempting, but it is impossible to realize it "for a lifetime." In March and April of this year, when the magnificent storm of the technological revolution swept the country, young people resolutely responded to the Party's call, regarded the trial production of ink paintings as a political task, and were determined to make it a success. Animation is drawn on transparent celluloid sheets one by one, and photographed frame by frame. A short film that lasts for ten minutes requires more than 10,000 continuous action frames. In order to ensure the unity of the image and not shake or shake, the modeling of almost all animations in the world is based on "single-line flat coating." The characteristics of ink painting are just the opposite, there is neither a clear edge line nor a flat coating. It is indeed difficult to obtain the same ink effect as brush painting on rice paper on tens of thousands of smooth celluloid sheets. We were not intimidated by these seemingly insurmountable difficulties, many comrades brought into play the spirit of daring to think, daring to do, not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of failure, and daring to innovate, and worked hard for three days and three nights, and actually overcame the fundamental key in technology. Then, the shapes of small animals—fish, shrimp, frogs, chicks and flowers—that are often drawn by Qi Baishi, a master of modern Chinese ink painting, were used to shoot several experimental clips, and preliminary results were obtained.

    The successful trial production of ink animation and paper-cut films also mark that Chinese fine arts films have opened up their own national new path in terms of form and style, improved and enriched the expressiveness and skills of fine arts films, and made Chinese fine arts films appear a new look, which will undoubtedly have a profound impact on the future development of fine arts films. But some comrades also doubt: "Is it necessary to activate ink paintings?" I am worried that this will destroy the tradition and ruin Qi Baishi's art. This view is incorrect: tradition must be inherited, but it must be discarded and selected; and new traditions should be developed and created, and new national forms that are compatible with new content should be created on the basis of our national traditions. Borrowing Qi Baishi's ink paintings to move on the screen did not damage his original works, but created a new form of fine arts film. Of course, today this is just a glimpse, it looks very immature, tomorrow it will be more like, more like. We also need to consider other schools of ink painting. In addition to ink painting, there are colored paintings, meticulous brush paintings, and freehand brush paintings; in addition to fish, shrimp, grass, and insects, there are also figures, flowers, birds, and landscapes. All kinds of images will sooner or later be re-created and active on the screen. There will be many difficulties, which can be expected, but all these difficulties belong to the difficulties in progress, and are difficulties that can be overcome. The growth of any new thing has to go through hardships and twists and turns. Isn't this exactly the case with the facts we have experienced in the process of creating modern themes and art forms? We firmly believe that new things will surely defeat old things and old ideas, because it represents the future, represents the direction of development, and no one can stop its sharpness.

    创造民族的美术电影
    特伟
    美术片是我国电影艺术中一个比较年青的片种。十一年来，它经历了“从无到有，由小到大，发展迅速”的成长过程。尤其大跃进以来，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想和党的总路线的光辉照耀下，出现了一个思想、创作、生产和技术上全面跃进的新面貌。产量从1958年前的平均年产五本猛增至四十七本，平均成本降低了55％；拍摄时间缩短了三分之一，影片质量也有了显著的提高。更大的收获还在于破除迷信，发扬创造精神，突破了旧的童话、民间故事和神话的题材范围，拍摄了大跃进、儿童生活和政治讽刺等现代题材的影片。同时，还创造了美术电影的新片种、新样式、新风格和新技巧。特别是剪纸片和水墨动画片的出现，使我国美术电影发展到一个新的阶段，形成了我们民族的独特风格。随着题材范围的扩大和样式的多样化，观众对象也扩大了。美术电影成了既是教育儿童、培养共产主义接班人的重要工具，又是“人人喜爱、老少咸宜”的思想教育武器。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线提出后，工农业战线上出现了大跃进的局面，促使大多数创作人员产生了强烈的反映现实生活、配合当前政治斗争的愿望。这种强烈的愿望汇成一股巨大的力量，开始向那种认为“美术电影难以反映现实”的旧思想、旧框框猛力冲击。一批青年同志尤其积极，在党中央提出要在十五年左右的时间内，在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国的战斗号召下，集体编写了一部政治鼓动片《赶英国》。当我国试制活性染料成功的时候，立即创作了一部《美妙的颜色》。同时，还拍摄了一批歌颂总路线、歌颂大跃进、歌颂我国劳动人民豪情壮志、冲天干劲的影片，如《庆丰收》、《歌唱总路线》等。这些影片，无论内容和形式都是崭新的，充满了时代气息。随后，表现力争上游精神的《小鲤鱼跳龙门》，表现人民公社威力、人定胜天、战胜自然的《壁画里的故事》，敢想敢做、创造奇迹的《小农艺家》等影片相继出现。与此同时，还拍摄了《谁唱得最好》、《鸽子》等一批政治讽刺片，成为结合当前国际形势，打击美帝国主义的锐利的武器。今年3、4月间，又高速度地创作了《艳阳春》、《革新迷》等四部反映技术革命的美术片。这样，就大大开拓了美术电影的表现领域，大大提高了美术电影的思想性和战斗性。通过这一系列的实践，“要不要反映现实”的问题解决了，现实题材能不能发挥美术片特点的问题，也通过大量出现的“新童话”体裁的美术片解决了。并且进一步明确了我们的幻想应当奠基在劳动的基础上，使神奇的因素进入现实之中是完全可能的，我们还要强调“更多的夸张、更多的幻想”来表现我们社会主义、共产主义的革命理想。
    动画和木偶电影是从外国移植过来的一种艺术形式。早期，我国的美术片受到了较多的外国影响是很自然的。经过十一年，特别是大跃进两年来的探索和创造，已经开始有了比较鲜明的民族风格。1955年拍摄的木偶片《神笔》和1956年拍摄的《骄傲的将军》，不仅在人物和背景的造型设计及表演上，大胆地从我国传统戏曲以及造型艺术中吸取滋养并加以发展和创造，而且在人物的思想感情、生活习惯、动作姿态以及语言上都力求具有中国民族的特色。这两部影片在民族风格的探索上获得较好的成绩，积累了一些经验。大家的认识都有了提高。并更加鼓舞和坚定了我们要在国际影坛上以“独创一格”的风貌，攀登无产阶级艺术高峰的雄心壮志。一部分青年同志在老艺术家的带领下，深入研究了我国的民间艺术——剪纸、窗花和皮影戏，创造了第一个新片种“剪纸电影”。剪纸、窗花和皮影戏，这些为人民喜闻乐见的传统艺术，不仅提供了造型美术上浓郁的民族色彩，而且还提示了不同地方特点、各种流派的皮影戏的表现技巧和风格样式。这些优美的艺术形式一旦结合了电影的特点，就发出不可估量的艺术力量，取得国内外观众良好的反应。
    每当我们考虑到如何使动画片这个外来的艺术形式具有更加鲜明的民族风格时，就会很自然地想到我们祖国优美的传统绘画艺术——水墨画。它不仅为我国广大人民所热爱，并且在世界画坛上占有独特的地位。但要使水墨画在银幕上动起来，在技术上和艺术上都存在不少的困难。不少人认为，根据我们人员的技术水平、设备条件和创作人员的国画根底太差的情况，短期内不可能解决。某些人甚至认为，把水墨画摄制成动画片只是一个美丽的幻想，这种幻想虽然非常诱人，但却是“一辈子”也不可能实现的。今年3、4月间，当波澜壮阔的技术革命的风暴席卷全国时，青年人坚决响应党的号召，把试制水墨画作为一个政治任务，决心要搞成功。动画片是一张一张的画在透明的赛璐珞片上，又是一格一格地拍摄出来的。一部放映十分钟的短片，就要有一万多张连续动作的画面。为了保证形象的统一和不晃不抖，所以几乎全世界所有的动画片的造型都是采取“单线平涂”。水墨画的特点正好相反，既没有明确的边缘线，又不是平涂。要在数以万计的光滑的赛璐珞片上求得同毛笔画在宣纸上的水墨效果一样，的确困难重重。我们并没有被这些看来似乎是不可克服的困难所吓倒，许多同志发挥了敢想敢做、不怕困难、不怕失败、勇于创新的精神，苦战了三天三夜，竟然攻克了技术上的根本关键。接着就采用我国现代水墨画大师齐白石常画的小动物——鱼、虾、青蛙、小鸡和花卉的造型，摄制了几个试验片段，初步获得成效。
    水墨动画片的试制成功和剪纸片同样标志着中国美术电影在形式、风格上开辟了自己民族的新的道路，提高和丰富了美术电影的表现力和技巧，使我国的美术电影出现了一个新的面貌，对今后美术片的发展无疑会产生深远的影响。但也有同志怀疑：“把水墨画活动起来是否必要？”耽心这样会破坏传统，糟塌了齐白石的艺术。这种看法是不正确的：传统一定要继承，但是要加扬弃；而且应当发展和创造新的传统，在我们民族传统的基础上创造和新内容相适应的新的民族形式。借齐白石的水墨画在银幕上活动起来，并没有损坏他的原作，却开创了美术电影的一个新形式。当然，今天这还只是刚露出一点苗头，看起来还很不成熟，明天就会像样些，更像样些。我们还要考虑其他各种流派的水墨画。水墨画以外，还有着色画、工笔画、写意画；鱼虾、草虫以外，还有人物、花鸟、山水。各种各样的形象迟早都要经过再创造而活跃在银幕上。困难将会很多，这是可以预计的，但所有这些困难都是属于前进中的困难，是能够克服的困难。任何新事物的成长，都是要经过艰难曲折的。我们在现代题材和艺术形式的创造过程中所经历的事实，难道不正是这样么？我们坚信：新事物一定会战胜旧事物、旧思想，因为它代表着未来，代表着发展方向，谁也阻挡不了它的锋芒。
