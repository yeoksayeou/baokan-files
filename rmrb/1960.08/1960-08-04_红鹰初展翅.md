Red Eagle Spreads its Wings for the First Time
	Chang Qiankun, Lieutenant General of the Air Force

	The new film "Red Eagle Spreads its Wings" produced by the August First Film Studio depicts the creation of the first aviation school of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It reflects the reality of this historical period through cinematic expression. This aviation school was born in the early days of the Liberation War. It explored some valuable experiences for the construction and development of the People's Air Force after the national liberation and made some necessary preparations ideologically, organizationally, and in the training of aviation technical cadres. Its growth and expansion vividly reflect the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and their infinite concern for army building, reflect the brilliant victory of Mao Zedong's military thought, and also reflect the People's Liberation Army's fine tradition of being indomitable, unafraid of difficulties, and hard-working.

	As early as 1938, Chairman Mao pointed out in his book "Problems of Strategy in Guerrilla War Against Japan": "In the long struggle, guerrilla units and guerrilla warfare should not remain at their original level but should develop to a higher stage, gradually transforming into regular troops and regular warfare..." The Party and Chairman Mao had long foreseen that with the development and victory of the Chinese revolutionary war, our army would inevitably transition from "millet plus rifles" to not only a strong army but also a strong air force and a strong navy. Therefore, in those years of arduous struggle, the Party transferred a group of Red Army cadres who had been tempered by revolution to Xinjiang to study aviation, regardless of the dangers and difficulties of the time. As soon as the War of Resistance Against Japan ended, the Party immediately sent a group of cadres to the Northeast Liberated Area to prepare for the establishment of our own aviation school and strived to unite a group of former aviation personnel to participate in the work. The film reflects the process of this school rapidly growing in accordance with the direction of the Party and Chairman Mao, overcoming numerous difficulties.

	At that time, the cadres who went to the Northeast to establish the aviation school were empty-handed, and there were several major difficulties facing them: first, equipment; second, teaching materials; third, primary and intermediate training aircraft; and fourth, fuel. In addition, there was a fairly complex struggle of ideology, viewpoints, and work style. Faced with these huge difficulties, what should we do? Could the aviation school be established after all? Our answer was firm: it could be established, it must be established. Who would do it? Would we rely on bourgeois experts, old intellectuals, and former aviation personnel to build the aviation school, or would we rely on revolutionary soldiers who had low levels of education but had been tested for a long time and had a high degree of political consciousness? We relied on the latter, not the former. This was a matter of principle. The differences and struggles between some former aviation personnel and us on this issue were fierce. It reflected the struggle between two lines, two ideologies, and two work styles on the road of army building. The theme of the film "Red Eagle Spreads its Wings" revolves around this struggle.

	The question of who to rely on is essentially a matter of the class line of army building. At that time, the Party adhered to Chairman Mao's class line of army building with workers and peasants as the backbone. As depicted in the film, the Party sent cadres like Huang Ping, Liu Kai, and Zhao Hang, who had been tempered by revolution, to serve as the backbone of the aviation school, and at the same time transferred a large number of workers and peasants like Ma Yongkui and Lin Xiaogang in the film from the army to learn to fly. The Party believed that the People's Air Force must maintain the essence of the people's army, be firmly in the hands of the Party, and serve the proletarian revolutionary cause wholeheartedly. Therefore, it was necessary to use revolutionary soldiers of worker and peasant origin, who had been tested in war, and were loyal to the Party and the people, to serve as the backbone and students of this first aviation school. Comrades of worker and peasant origin had low levels of education, and learning to fly certainly had certain difficulties; but their political consciousness was high, their revolutionary spirit was strong, their practical experience was rich, and they were willing to study hard and diligently, which cleared all obstacles for overcoming the difficulties on the road of learning; and once they really mastered aviation technology, they would be like tigers with wings and could create miracles in air combat. Facts have proved that in the Chinese People's Volunteers' War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and in our army's successive battles to defend the airspace of the motherland, the vast majority of those who fought well and achieved remarkable results were cadres and soldiers of worker and peasant origin who had been tempered in combat in the army. Without these comrades as the backbone, a People's Air Force with strong combat effectiveness could not be established.

	However, some former aviation personnel believed that: "The door of aviation science is open to intellectuals." They did not believe that workers and peasants could fly into the sky. Just like the flight instructor Cai Jiefei in the film. He was superstitious about the aviation science of the imperialist bourgeoisie and completely copied the set of bourgeois practices that were divorced from reality, forcing students to memorize formulas and cram books, making everyone dizzy and unable to learn. We resolutely criticized this erroneous teaching ideology and training method, and put forward the teaching policy of "quick, practical, and quickly mastering technology," mobilized the masses, boldly carried out innovation and creation, and adopted intuitive teaching methods, moving those unusable old aircraft, engines, and aviation equipment into the classroom, lecturing, watching, and performing operations at the same time. In this way, the students quickly understood the principles of aviation, mastered aviation technology, and also understood that "science is not mysterious," and that abstract and difficult aviation principles are inherent in practice. The bold creation of going directly to advanced trainer aircraft training, as portrayed in the film, was unimaginable to some former aviation personnel at the time. They believed that: this violated the principles of science and the three-level training system of various countries in the world. Flying advanced trainer aircraft requires at least one or two hundred hours of flight experience on primary and intermediate trainer aircraft. "Going directly to advanced trainer aircraft" was unheard of in the history of world aviation. In our opinion, flight training should indeed adhere to the principle of gradual progress, but the aviation theory of the bourgeoisie and its prescribed set of teaching programs, courses, and teaching methods are not sacred and inviolable classics. Especially when there were no primary and intermediate training aircraft at that time, only advanced training aircraft, there were only two paths in front of the aviation school: either directly use advanced training aircraft for flight training; or close the aviation school and stop training. Of course, we Communists cannot be overwhelmed by difficulties. We resolutely took the first path, broke through all difficulties and bourgeois training methods and old conventions, and unswervingly used advanced training aircraft to directly train pilots. Of course, in the training process, we carefully took many measures, such as strengthening ground preparation, extending flight time with instructors, carrying out teaching democracy, widely mobilizing the masses to think of ways, and constantly improving training methods and improving the initiative of learning, and so on. Finally, the training flight of "going directly to" advanced trainer aircraft was successful.

	All of this fully shows that by resolutely implementing the principle of linking theory with practice and the mass line method put forward by Chairman Mao, we can blaze our own path in teaching, and we can train pilots more, faster, better, and more economically in the extremely difficult situation at that time.

	The film "Red Eagle Spreads its Wings" more prominently reflects the above-mentioned situation and the process of resolving several ideological contradictions, and runs through a red line of Mao Zedong's military thought from beginning to end. The path taken by the aviation school depicted in the film is the path of victorious advancement along Mao Zedong's military thought. In the spring of 1949, when the Party was preparing to officially begin building the People's Air Force, our beloved leader Chairman Mao encouraged the comrades of this aviation school, saying: "You have cultivated a batch of seeds for the formal establishment of the Air Force in the future." Today, under the cultivation of the Party, this batch of seeds has blossomed and borne fruit in the cause of building the People's Air Force. They are working hard a hundredfold in their glorious combat posts, studying Chairman Mao's military thought, learning advanced military science and technology, vigilantly defending the airspace of the motherland, and are ready to defeat the imperialist aggressors at any time.

    红鹰初展翅	空军中将　常乾坤
    八一制片厂的新片《红鹰展翅》描写的是中国人民解放军第一所航空学校创建的经过。它通过电影的表现方法，反映了过去这一段历史的真实情况。这所航空学校，是在解放战争初期诞生的。它为全国解放后人民空军的建设和发展，摸索了一些可贵的经验，在思想上、组织上和在培养航空技术干部上，作了一些必要的准备工作。它的成长壮大的过程，生动地反映了党和毛主席的英明领导和对军队建设的无限关怀，反映了毛泽东军事思想的光辉胜利，也反映了人民解放军不屈不挠、不畏困难、艰苦奋斗的优良传统。
    早在1938年，毛主席在《战争和战略问题》一书中就已经指出过：“在长期奋斗中，游击队和游击战争应不停止于原来的地位，而向高级阶段发展，逐渐地变为正规军和正规战争……”。党和毛主席早就预见到随着中国革命战争的发展和胜利，我军必然由“小米加步枪”，逐渐过渡到不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和强大的海军。因此，在那艰苦奋战的岁月里，党就抽调了一批久经革命锻炼的红军干部，不顾当时环境的艰险困难，到新疆去学习航空。抗日战争刚一结束，党又立即派了一批干部到东北解放区去筹建我们自己的航空学校，并争取和团结了一批旧航空人员参加了工作。影片所反映的正是这个学校按照党和毛主席指示的方向，冲破了重重困难迅速成长的过程。
    当时到东北去办航校的干部都是赤手空拳，横在他们面前的有几大难关：一是器材；二是教材；三是初中级教练机；四是燃料。此外还有一个相当复杂的思想、观点和作风问题的斗争。面对这些巨大的困难怎么办呢？航校究竟能不能办起来呢？我们的回答是坚决的，能办起来，一定要办起来。靠谁来办呢？是靠资产阶级专家、旧知识分子、旧航空人员来建设航空学校呢，还是依靠文化程度虽低，但却久经考验、具有高度政治觉悟的革命战士来建设航空学校呢？我们依靠的是后者而不是前者。这是一个带原则性的问题。一些旧航空人员同我们在这个问题上的分歧和斗争是激烈的。它反映了建军道路上两条路线、两种思想、两种作风的斗争。影片《红鹰展翅》的主题正是围绕着这一斗争展开的。
    依靠谁的问题，实质上是一个建军的阶级路线问题，党在当时坚持了毛主席的以工农为骨干的建军的阶级路线，正如影片中所描绘的，党派了像黄平、刘凯、赵航这样一些久经革命锻炼的干部来充当航校骨干，同时又从陆军调来了一大批像影片中的马永奎、林小刚这样经受过战争考验的工农子弟来学习飞行。党认为人民空军一定要保持人民军队的本质，牢固地掌握在党的手中，要忠心耿耿地为无产阶级革命事业服务。因此，就必须以工农出身的、经过战争考验的、忠于党、忠于人民的革命战士来充当这第一所航空学校的骨干和学员。工农出身的同志，文化程度低，学习飞行固然有一定的困难；但是他们的政治觉悟高，革命事业心强，实际经验丰富，肯钻研，肯勤学苦练，这就为克服学习道路上的困难扫清了一切障碍；及至他们一旦真的掌握了航空技术，便是如虎添翼，能在空战中创造奇迹了。事实证明，在中国人民志愿军抗美援朝和我军历次保卫祖国领空的战斗中，凡是打得好、战绩卓著的，绝大部分都是那些工农出身的、在陆军中经过战斗锻炼的干部和战士。没有这些同志作骨干，就不能建立起一支具有坚强战斗力的人民空军。
    但是，一些旧航空人员却认为：“航空科学的大门是朝着知识分子开的。”他们不相信工农子弟能够飞上天去。正像影片中的飞行教员蔡杰飞一样。他迷信帝国主义资产阶级的航空科学，完全照搬资产阶级脱离实际的一套，硬要学员死背公式，死啃书本，弄得大家头昏脑胀，学不下去。我们坚决地批判了这种错误的教学思想和训练方法，提出了“速成的、联系实际的、迅速把技术学到手”的教学方针，发动群众，大胆进行革新创造，采取了直观教学的方法，把那些不能使用的旧飞机、发动机和航空器材搬到教室里，边讲、边看、边操作表演。这样，学员就很快地弄通了航空原理，掌握了航空技术，同时也懂得了“科学并不神秘”，和抽象的难懂的航空原理寓于实际之中的道理。影片中表现的直上高级教练机训练的大胆创造，当时在一些旧航空人员看来，也是难以想像的。他们认为：这是违反科学和世界各国三级训练制原则的，飞高级教练机起码要一、二百小时初、中级教练机的飞行基础，“直上高级教练机”，是世界航空史上所没有的。在我们看来，飞行训练诚然是应当遵守循序渐进的原则的，但是，资产阶级的航空理论和它所规定的一套教范、教程和教学方法，也并不是神圣不可侵犯的经典。特别是在当时没有初、中级教练机只有高级教练机的情况下，摆在航校面前的只有两条路，要么就是直接用高级教练机训练飞行；要么就是航校关门，停止训练。当然我们共产党人是不能被困难所压服的，我们坚决走了第一条路，冲破了一切困难和资产阶级的训练方法和陈规旧套，坚定不移地利用高级教练机直接训练飞行员。当然在训练过程中我们是小心翼翼地采取了许多措施，如加强地面准备，延长带飞时间，开展教学民主，广泛发动群众想办法，不断改进训练方法，提高学习自觉性等等。终于使“直上”高级教练机的训练飞行获得成功。
    这一切都充分表明，坚决贯彻毛主席所提出的理论联系实际的原则和群众路线的方法，我们就能在教学上走出一条自己的道路，就能在当时极端困难的情况下多快好省地培养出飞行员来。
    影片《红鹰展翅》比较突出地反映了上述情况和几种思想矛盾及其解决的过程，自始至终贯穿着一条毛泽东军事思想的红线。影片里所描写的这所航校所走过的道路，就是沿着毛泽东军事思想胜利前进的道路。1949年春天，当着党准备正式开始建设人民空军的时候，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席曾经勉励这个航校的同志说：“你们为今后正式建立空军培养了一批种子。”今天，这批种子在党的栽培下，已经在人民空军建设的事业中，开花结果了。他们正在自己光荣的战斗岗位上，百倍努力地学习毛主席的军事思想，学习先进的军事科学技术，警惕地保卫着祖国的领空，随时准备战胜帝国主义侵略者。（附图片）
