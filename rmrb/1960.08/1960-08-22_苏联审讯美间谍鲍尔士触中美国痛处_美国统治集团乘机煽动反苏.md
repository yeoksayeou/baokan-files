Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 21st: The American ruling group is clamoring noisily about the Soviet trial and sentencing of American spy plane pilot Powers, and threatening to take "countermeasures" on the matter.

American President Eisenhower, on the 19th, issued a statement through White House Press Secretary Hagerty, falsely accusing the Soviet trial and sentencing of the American spy pilot of being a so-called "propaganda campaign," and expressed "regret" about it.

On the same day, American Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy also clamored that the Soviet government's just verdict on the American spy was "extremely severe," and he actually wanted the Soviet government to show "mercy" to the American spy.  American House Republican Deputy Leader Arends clamored that he felt "shocked" by this.

According to United Press International, the U.S. State Department and other officials are "planning to hold a series of meetings immediately to discuss countermeasures." The news agency said that the U.S. government has appointed an "unofficial" committee "to begin considering possible steps," and the members of this committee include officials from the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency.

The American propaganda machine is also conducting anti-Soviet clamoring on a grand scale. The "New York Herald Tribune" felt that the Soviet lawyer's exposure of the essence of the American social system and its aggressive policies during the trial particularly touched the American rulers' sore spot. Therefore, the newspaper, in an editorial on the 20th, specifically attacked the Soviet Union for being "malicious" on this point, and threatened that the Soviet Union's exposure of the United States was "not a good omen for the relaxation of international tensions."

The "New York Post" hypocritically expressed "sympathy" for the family of the spy Powers and attempted to incite anti-Soviet sentiment. However, the newspaper also had to admit that in this trial, "of course, the United States itself" was placed in the "defendant's seat" because the U.S. government "has actually admitted that it is engaged in espionage activities."

    苏联审讯美间谍鲍尔士触中美国痛处
    美国统治集团乘机煽动反苏
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国统治集团就苏联审讯和判处美国间谍飞机驾驶员鲍尔士一事大肆叫嚷，并且威胁要就此采取“对策”。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔19日通过白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂发表一项声明，诬蔑苏联审讯和判处美国间谍飞行员是所谓“宣传活动”，并且对此表示“遗憾”。
    同一天，美国民主党总统候选人肯尼迪也叫嚷苏联政府对美国间谍的正义判决是“极其严厉的”，他居然要苏联政府对美国间谍表示“仁慈”。美国众议院共和党副领袖艾伦兹叫嚣说他对此感到“惊愕”。
    据合众国际社报道，美国国务院和其他官员“计划立即举行一系列会议来讨论对策”。这家通讯社说，美国政府已经任命了一个“非正式”的委员会“开始考虑可能的步骤”，这个委员会的成员包括国务院、国防部和中央情报局的官员。
    美国的宣传机器也大肆进行反苏叫嚣。“纽约先驱论坛报”觉得审讯中苏联律师对美国社会制度和侵略政策本质的揭露特别触痛美国统治者的疮疤。因此，这家报纸20日在社论里特别针对这一点攻击苏联“恶毒”，并且威胁说，苏联对美国的揭露“对国际紧张局势的缓和不是一个吉兆”。
    “纽约邮报”假惺惺地对间谍鲍尔士家属表示“怜悯”，并且企图煽动反苏情绪。但是，这家报纸同时也不得不承认，在这次审讯中被置于“被告席上的当然是美国本身”，因为美国政府“实际上已经承认了它在进行间谍活动”。
