Brotherly countries are busy with the summer harvest
Soviet farmers are simultaneously harvesting grain and selling it to the state. Bulgarian workers and students are flocking to the countryside to help with the summer harvest. Romanian state farms and collective farms are supporting each other. Czechoslovakia has decided to shorten the harvest period by ten days compared to last year. In the German Democratic Republic, winter barley crops are generally good.
Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: The wheat harvest in the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic is currently underway. News from these countries indicates that grain harvests in many regions of these countries are expected to be bountiful this year.

As of July 25, the total area harvested in the Soviet Union reached 23.6 million hectares, accounting for 22% of the total sown area.

Judging from the growth and harvest of grains, a bumper harvest of grains is expected in western and eastern Siberia this year. The harvest is also good in the North Caucasus and Don regions. For example, in the Kuban region, the average yield is more than 22 quintals per hectare, and in the Stavropol Territory, the average yield is 17-19 quintals per hectare, both higher than last year.

While harvesting grain, agricultural laborers in various parts of the Soviet Union are also actively selling grain to the state. For example, the Uzbek Republic, the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Republic, and the Dagestan Autonomous Republic have successively completed their plans for selling grain to the state.

The summer harvest in Bulgaria has begun nationwide. This year, the most important summer harvest crop in Bulgaria is wheat, totaling 13.2 million decares. According to estimates by the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture based on harvested yields, the national average yield of wheat per unit area is expected to exceed last year. So far, the highest wheat yield per unit area in the country is from the agricultural production cooperative in Zmanichevo Village, Pazardzhik Province, where an average of 800 kilograms of wheat was harvested per decare from 27 decares of land.

Workers, students, and Party and state organ cadres in various cities are actively responding to the call of the Party and government to support the rural summer harvest. Some factories and enterprises have even stipulated a system of rotating employees to participate in the summer harvest.

As of July 22, 81% of the wheat in Romania had been harvested. During the harvest, state farms and collective farms in various regions supported each other. With the help of state farms, the Kuimir Collective Farm in Galati County completed the harvest of all its wheat in just four days.

This year's wheat harvest in Romania is generally abundant. The average yield of wheat per hectare in the Țidva State Farm in Stalin Region is 2,800-3,000 kilograms, which is 700-900 kilograms more than last year. The average yield of wheat already harvested in state farms in Bucharest, Oradea, Ploiești, and other regions is 2,000-2,230 kilograms per hectare.

Although some areas of Czechoslovakia have been affected by drought and flooding this year, a bumper harvest is still expected. For example, the Želiezovce State Farm, which has completed its harvesting task, harvested 42 quintals of barley per hectare.

Because 2,300 agricultural production cooperatives have been merged into 1,000 cooperatives this year, it is more conducive to the full utilization of machinery and manpower. At the same time, the 25,000 new cadres who were sent to work in the countryside at the beginning of this year directly participated in the wheat harvest, and they played a great role in organizing and directing the wheat harvest. This year, all agricultural production cooperatives and state farms have decided to complete the harvest in ten days less than last year.

The first harvest season after the complete collectivization of agriculture in the German Democratic Republic has now begun throughout the country. According to "Wirtschaftswoche," winter barley is generally good throughout the country, and rapeseed in the southern regions of the republic will achieve particularly high yields.

Currently, farmers in agricultural production cooperatives throughout the German Democratic Republic are actively responding to the call of the Party and the state, striving to harvest and transport summer harvest crops quickly and without loss.

    兄弟国家夏收忙
    苏联农民一面收割谷物一面向国家交售粮食  保加利亚大批工人学生纷纷到农村帮助夏收  罗马尼亚各地国营农场和集体农庄相互支援   捷克斯洛伐克决定把收割期比去年缩短十天  德意志民主共和国各地冬大麦收成普遍良好
    据新华社29日讯　苏联、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国的麦收工作，目前正紧张进行。来自这些国家的消息表明，今年这些国家不少地区的谷物可望丰收。
    截至7月25日，苏联全国收割面积已经达到二千三百六十万公顷，占总播种面积22％。
    从谷物成长情况和收获情况看来，今年，苏联西伯利亚西部和东部地区的谷物可望丰收。北高加索和顿河地区，收成也好。例如，在库班地区，平均每公顷打谷二十二公担以上，在斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区，每公顷平均收获了十七—十九公担，都比去年有增加。
    苏联各地农业劳动者在收割谷物的同时，还积极向国家交售粮食。例如，乌兹别克共和国、车臣印古希自治共和国和达吉斯坦自治共和国相继完成向国家交售粮食的计划。
    保加利亚的夏收工作已在全国展开。今年，保加利亚的夏收谷物中最主要的是小麦，共有一千三百二十万狄卡尔。据保加利亚农业部根据已收割的产量估计，今年全国小麦的单位面积产量平均将超过去年。到目前为止，全国小麦单位面积产量最高的是巴萨吉克州兹马尼切沃村的农业生产合作社，这个合作社从二十七狄卡尔土地上平均每狄卡尔收了八百公斤小麦。
    各地城市的工人、学生和党与国家机关工作人员积极响应党和政府号召，支援农村进行夏收。有的地方的工厂、企业还规定了职工轮流参加夏收的制度。
    到7月22日为止，罗马尼亚全国已经收获了81％的小麦，在收获中，各地国营农场和集体农庄之间互相支援。加拉齐州库伊米尔集体农庄在国营农场的帮助下，只用了四天就收完了全部小麦。
    今年罗马尼亚的小麦普遍丰收。斯大林州的蒂德瓦国营农场每公顷小麦的单位面积产量平均二千八百—三千公斤，比去年多七百—九百公斤。布加勒斯特、俄拉第亚、普罗什蒂等州的国营农场已经收获的小麦平均产量每公顷达二千—二千二百三十公斤。
    今年，捷克斯洛伐克虽然有些地区曾受到干旱和雨涝的影响，但是仍可望丰收。例如，已完成收割任务的泽利佐夫策国营农场，每公顷收到了四十二公担大麦。
    由于今年把二千三百个农业生产合作社合并成一千个合作社，这就更有利于机器和人力的充分利用。同时，今年年初被派往农村工作的二万五千名新干部直接参加了麦收工作，他们对组织和指挥麦收起了很大作用。今年，所有的农业生产合作社和国营农场都决定以比去年缩短十天的时间完成收获工作。
    德意志民主共和国农业全部合作化后的第一个收获季节，现在已在全国各地开始。据“经济周刊”报道，全国各地冬大麦普遍良好，共和国南部地区的油菜将获得特别高的产量。
    目前，德意志民主共和国各地农业生产合作社的农民正积极响应党和国家的号召，力争又快又无损失地收割和运输夏收作物。
