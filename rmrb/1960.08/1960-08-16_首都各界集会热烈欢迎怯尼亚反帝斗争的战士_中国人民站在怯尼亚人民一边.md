Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch: People from all circles in the capital held a rally this afternoon to warmly welcome the anti-imperialist and peace-defending warrior, Vice Chairman of the Kenya African National Union, Oginga Odinga, and his assistant, Vera Ambiso, Secretary of the Kenyan Office in Cairo, who are visiting our country.

廖承志 said: With the support of the people of the world, the Kenyan people will surely achieve independence soon through united and unremitting struggle.
奥廷加 strongly condemned the aggression and threats of US imperialism and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization supported by it against Africa and Kenya.

    Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, said in his speech that the 650 million Chinese people will always stand with the Kenyan people, deeply sympathize with and resolutely support the Kenyan people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The Kenyan people's struggle is our struggle, and the Kenyan people's victory is our victory. With the strong support of the people all over the world, the Kenyan people will surely achieve independence soon through united and unremitting struggle.

    Mr. Odinga delivered a long speech at the meeting, full of friendship, fighting spirit, and confidence in the future. He strongly condemned the aggression and threats of US imperialism and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization supported by it against Africa and Kenya. He pointed out that history has already pronounced judgment on colonialism, and imperialism, whether using barbaric force or playing insidious tricks, cannot save its doomed fate.

    Liao Chengzhi spoke first at the meeting. On behalf of the Chinese people, he extended a warm welcome and respect to the African friends who had come from afar. He said that British colonialism has cruelly enslaved the Kenyan people since the end of the nineteenth century and has adopted various means of terror to brutally suppress the Kenyan national independence movement, wantonly massacre Kenyan patriotic people, and arrest Jomo Kenyatta, the leader beloved by the Kenyan people. The Kenyan people have waged a long-term struggle against imperialism and for national independence. They once bravely took up arms to resist imperialism and played a significant role in advancing the African people's independence movement.

    Liao Chengzhi emphasized that recently, the forces of US imperialism have also infiltrated Kenya in various ways, and the highly vigilant Kenyan people are also resolutely opposing the aggressive plots of US imperialism. The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and resolutely supported the just struggles of the Kenyan people against imperialism and for national independence. We demand the immediate withdrawal of all imperialist armies and military bases in Kenya and the immediate release of Kenyan national leader Jomo Kenyatta. We demand that all imperialist forces immediately get out of Kenya and all of Africa.

    Liao Chengzhi said that we are very pleased to see that recently a storm against imperialism has risen all over the world. The African people's movement against imperialism and for liberation is flourishing and has achieved a series of victories. The heroic Algerian people's armed struggle against French colonialism is victoriously unfolding, and the Congolese people are waging a just struggle against imperialist aggression and interference and to defend the independence and territorial integrity of their motherland. Here, let us extend fraternal, fighting salutations to the people of Kenya and all of Africa, and wish their struggle an early final and complete victory. Liao Chengzhi finally said that we believe that Mr. Odinga's visit to China this time will surely greatly promote the friendship between the Chinese and Kenyan people.

    Oginga Odinga, Vice Chairman of the Kenya African National Union, spoke amid warm applause. The full text is as follows:

Mr. Chairman, dear comrades:

    Please allow me, on the occasion of my first visit to your powerful Republic, which is important and of historical significance, in the name of the people of all countries in the struggle in all of Africa, and in the name of eight million Africans in Kenya, to first pay my respects to you, and to ask you to convey friendly, sincere, and warm greetings to the 650 million people of the People's Republic of China and the capable leaders united around your great leader, Mao Zedong.

    As you all know and remember, about eighty years ago, greedy Europe divided up Africa in a frenzy of devouring and exploiting our continent. Before that, this wolf-like Europe had stretched its poisonous fangs into Asia. Your country was subjected to colonialist and imperialist aggression. British imperialists, competing with their German rivals, invaded East Africa at the end of the last century, that is, after the Berlin Conference, at which the plan and scheme to divide Africa was put forward. Thus, for such a long period of time, Africa and Asia have been ruled and exploited. For such a long time, we used our resources to build the capitals of European countries and feed the people there, while our own people suffered from hunger and poverty.

    In 1920, the British, despite the strong and serious protests of the Africans, declared Kenya a colony. The purpose of this sinister act was to give the British legal authority to distribute leased land to white immigrants in Kenya, thereby ignoring and cancelling the land rights of the Kenyan Africans. The land was declared Crown land, which meant that it had become the property of the British King and Queens, not the property of the Africans.

    In 1922, our first revolution broke out, when our leaders demanded the immediate return of the seized land and the abolition of discriminatory laws. In the streets of our capital, Nairobi, machine guns were used to shoot at our people who were holding peaceful demonstrations. In this way, the blood of brave patriots was shed for the first time on the glorious Kenyan soil. Thus began our people's continuous struggle for liberation and national independence.

    In the struggle of 1922, our outstanding leader Jomo Kenyatta had already participated. In 1923, the British stated that the interests of Africans in Kenya would always be paramount. Our people took their words seriously. Therefore, in 1929, Jomo Kenyatta was sent to London as a representative, told not to return home until he had achieved the following: A, restore African land rights; B, Africans who have lost land have the right to restore their rights; C, respect African political and civil rights.

    Kenyatta conducted peaceful negotiations and appealed to the British government and people for seventeen years. They turned a deaf ear to his words. Therefore, Jomo Kenyatta returned to Kenya in 1946 without achieving any major success from the British government.

    After returning to China, Jomo Kenyatta immediately launched a national liberation movement to force the British to accept Jomo's discovery of the just and fair demands of the Africans. At that time, Africans were in a state of extreme disappointment in all aspects. When Jomo traveled around the country, preaching unity among Africans, the British imperialists took provocative measures, which resulted in the outbreak of the liberation struggle of 1952. That was the Mau Mau movement. The Mau Mau movement was the result of the failure of Africans' hopes in the economic, social, and political aspects under British imperialist rule. The Mau Mau Revolution rescued our people from the premeditated policy of the British imperialists to eliminate and exterminate Africans. This is a brilliant and heroic struggle of our people, and this struggle is the precursor to all revolutionary movements in Africa today. In this way, Kenya has educated Africa with the spirit of revolution. The Mau Mau movement was brutally suppressed by the British imperialists in 1955, and Jomo Kenyatta was imprisoned in 1953 for seven years. Even at this moment, he is still in exile, and his liberation movement, the Kenya African Union, has also been banned and suppressed.

    The British imperialists, supported by their allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, refuse to release Jomo Kenyatta because he is a man loved by the masses. All our people, from young people to old people, love him.

    There are bases of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization supported by the United States in our country. Americans have infiltrated our trade union movement, and their intelligence agents are all over Kenya. In fact, in Kenya, the threat of US imperialism is greater than that of Britain itself. Our struggle is against the entire NATO army.

    In May of this year, we established the Kenya African National Union as the vanguard of our liberation movement. The Kenya African National Union advocates immediately organizing the masses of our people to fight heroically for absolute national independence now. Through the Kenya African National Union, the Kenyan people have learned that we must win our freedom by organizing the masses to achieve unity. This is our task from now until our general election in February next year.

    While our people are fighting against the British imperialists, history is also developing along its natural path. Since history has already pronounced judgment on colonialism, neither barbaric force nor the insidious trick of engaging in fake independence can save its doomed fate. The people of Asia and Africa are the executors of the judgment made by history. Therefore, in 1960 (the year of decision for Africa), we witnessed imperialism shivering in Africa from one defeat to another.

    Not long ago, our brothers in the Congo gained independence after a heroic struggle. But imperialism—collective imperialism—conspired in Washington to strangle the infant independence of the Congo. As you all know, this conspiracy has failed.

    It is not only the Congo that is threatened by US imperialism, but the whole of Africa. Kenya is seriously threatened by US imperialism.

    Dear friends, the people of Asia and Africa have a common history. They have all suffered imperialist aggression. Asia is practically free, while Africa remains a stronghold of colonialism. But Africa has a real opportunity to draw experience from its Asian brothers. Your struggle was and still is our struggle, and your experience is our experience. That is why we are so deeply impressed by what you have done since your heroic struggle.

    It is not enough to simply draw experience. We must strengthen and consolidate our ranks to deal with the conspiracies of imperialism. Asia and Africa have both had glorious histories in the past, and this history must now be restored and reborn. The spirit of Afro-Asian solidarity was born in Bandung. In 1957 in Cairo, this spirit was strengthened. Today we are your guests, and tomorrow you will surely be welcomed in a free and independent Kenya. We are issuing this invitation now because we are confident that our struggle will soon be victorious. At the same time, we would like to urge you to continue to support our struggle for independence now and the release of our outstanding leader Jomo Kenyatta.

    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    Long live a free and independent Africa!

    Long live Jomo Kenyatta and Kenya!

    Long live African solidarity!

    Long live world peace and friendship!

Their speeches were extremely warmly received. After the speeches, the conference passed a telegram supporting the struggle of the Kenyan people.

    Today's conference was jointly organized by the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity and the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association. The participants in the conference included: Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Xu Pingyu, Vice President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, Kang Yonghe, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Qingyang, Vice President of the All-China Women's Federation, Zhu Ziqi, Secretary-General of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, Yang Shuo, Deputy Secretary-General, Wang Mingyuan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Wu Qing, Secretary-General of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, and representatives of the All-China Youth Federation, and others.

    首都各界集会热烈欢迎怯尼亚反帝斗争的战士
    中国人民站在怯尼亚人民一边
    廖承志说：在世界人民支持下，怯尼亚人民通过团结一致不懈的斗争，定能早日获得独立奥廷加强烈谴责美帝国主义和由它支持的北大西洋公约组织对非洲和怯尼亚的侵略和威胁
    新华社15日讯　首都各界人民今天下午举行集会，热烈欢迎前来我国访问的反对帝国主义保卫和平的战士、怯尼亚非洲民族联盟副主席奥金加·奥廷加，和他的助手怯尼亚驻开罗办事处秘书韦腊·安比梭。
    中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志在讲话中说，六亿五千万中国人民永远站在怯尼亚人民一边，深切同情和坚决支持怯尼亚人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争。怯尼亚人民的斗争就是我们的斗争，怯尼亚人民的胜利就是我们的胜利。在全世界人民强大支持下，怯尼亚人民通过团结一致不懈的斗争，一定能够早日获得独立。
    奥廷加先生在会上发表了充满友谊、战斗精神和对未来信心的长篇讲话。他强烈谴责美帝国主义和由它支持下的北大西洋公约组织对非洲和怯尼亚的侵略和威胁。他指出，历史已经向殖民主义宣布了判决，帝国主义不论是使用野蛮的武力或者玩弄恶毒的花招，都不能挽救它注定灭亡的命运。
    廖承志在会上首先讲话，他代表中国人民向远道而来的非洲朋友表示热烈的欢迎和敬意。他说，英国殖民主义者从十九世纪末以来对怯尼亚人民进行了残酷的奴役，并采取各种恐怖手段，横暴地镇压怯尼亚的民族独立运动，肆意屠杀怯尼亚爱国人民，逮捕了怯尼亚人民所热爱的领袖乔莫·肯雅塔。怯尼亚人民为反对帝国主义、争取民族独立，进行了长期的斗争，他们曾经英勇地拿起了武器反抗帝国主义，对推进非洲人民的独立运动起了重大的作用。
    廖承志强调指出，最近，美帝国主义的势力也从各方面渗入怯尼亚，有着高度警惕的怯尼亚人民也在坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。中国人民一贯深切同情和坚决支持怯尼亚人民反对帝国主义和争取民族独立的正义斗争。我们要求立即撤出帝国主义在怯尼亚的一切军队和军事基地、立即释放怯尼亚的民族领袖乔莫·肯雅塔。要求一切帝国主义势力立即从怯尼亚以及全非洲的土地上滚出去。
    廖承志说，我们非常高兴地看到，最近全世界各地都兴起了反对帝国主义的风暴。非洲人民反对帝国主义争取解放的运动正在蓬勃发展并取得一系列的胜利。英雄的阿尔及利亚人民反抗法国殖民主义者的武装斗争正在胜利地开展着，刚果人民为反对帝国主义的侵略和干涉、保卫祖国的独立和领土完整进行着正义的斗争，在这里让我们向怯尼亚和全非洲的人民致以兄弟的、战斗的敬礼，祝他们的斗争早日取得最后的、彻底的胜利。廖承志最后说，我们相信，奥廷加先生这次来访问中国一定能大大促进中国人民与怯尼亚人民之间的友谊。
    怯尼亚非洲民族联盟副主席奥金加·奥廷加在热烈的掌声中讲话。全文如下：主席先生，亲爱的同志们：
    请允许我在我首次访问你们强大的共和国这个重要而且具有历史意义的时机，以整个非洲斗争中的各国人民的名义，并以怯尼亚八百万非洲人的名义，首先向你们致敬，并请你们向中华人民共和国六亿五千万人民以及团结在你们的伟大领袖毛泽东周围的精干的领导人们转达友好的、诚挚的、热烈的问候。
    在座各位都知道并记得，大约在八十年前，贪婪的欧洲在吞噬和剥削我们大陆的狂潮中瓜分了非洲。在此以前，就是这个饿狼般的欧洲曾把它的毒牙伸到亚洲。贵国就受到殖民主义和帝国主义的侵略。英帝国主义者在与他们的德国对手互相竞争的情况下，于上世纪末侵入了东非，那就是在柏林会议之后，在那次会议上提出了瓜分非洲的打算和计划。因而，在那么长的一段时期里，非洲和亚洲一直受着统治和剥削。在那样长的时间里，我们以我们的资源，建筑了欧洲各国的首都，并喂养了那里的人，而我们自己的人民却忍饥受饿，死于贫困。
    1920年，英国人不顾非洲人的强烈和严重抗议，宣布怯尼亚为殖民地。这个罪恶的行动的目的，在于使英国人有合法权力来向怯尼亚的白种移民分发租借土地，从而无视和取消了怯尼亚非洲人的土地权。土地被宣布为王土，这就是说，它已成了英国国王和王后们的财产，而不是非洲人的财产。
    1922年，爆发了我们的第一次革命，那时我们的领袖要求立即归还被攫夺去的土地和取消歧视性的法律。在我们首都内罗毕的街道上，用机枪来扫射我国举行和平示威游行的人民。就这样，勇敢的爱国人民的鲜血第一次洒在光荣的怯尼亚土地上。从此开始了我国人民争取解放和民族独立的继续不断的斗争。
    在1922年的斗争中，业已有我国卓越的领袖乔莫·肯雅塔参加。1923年，英国人声明非洲人的利益在怯尼亚将永远是主要的，我国人民认为他们的话是认真的。因此在1929年，乔莫·肯雅塔被派往伦敦作为代表，叫他不达到下列几点不要回国：甲、恢复非洲人的土地权利；乙、失去了土地的非洲人有权恢复他们的权利；丙、尊重非洲人政治和公民权利。
    肯雅塔进行和平谈判、向英国政府和人民呼吁达十七年之久。他们对他的话置若罔闻。因此，乔莫·肯雅塔在1946年回到怯尼亚，没有从英国政府那里取得任何重大成功。
    乔莫·肯雅塔回国后，立即发动了一个民族解放运动来迫使英国人接受乔莫发现的非洲人的正义和公正的要求，那个时候，非洲人在所有方面都处于极端失望的境地。当乔莫在全国各地奔走，在非洲人中间宣传团结的时候，英帝国主义者采取了挑衅措施，其结果是爆发了1952年的解放斗争。那就是茅茅运动。茅茅运动是非洲人在英帝国主义统治下在经济、社会和政治方面的希望落空的结果。茅茅革命把我国人民从英帝国主义者想消灭和灭绝非洲人的蓄谋政策中解救出来。这是我国人民的一个光辉而英勇的斗争，这个斗争是今天非洲所有革命运动的前驱。就这样，怯尼亚使非洲受到了革命精神的教育。茅茅运动在1955年受到英帝国主义者的残酷镇压，乔莫·肯雅塔在1953年被投入监狱，达七年之久。甚至就在此刻，他仍然在流放中，他的解放运动——怯尼亚非洲联盟也遭禁止和镇压。
    英帝国主义者在他们北大西洋公约组织盟国的支持下，不肯释放乔莫·肯雅塔，因为他是受群众爱戴的人。我国所有的人，从年轻人到老年人，都爱戴他。
    我国境内有着受美国支持的北大西洋公约组织的基地。美国人渗入我们的工会运动，他们的谍报人员遍布整个怯尼亚。实际上，在怯尼亚，美帝国主义的威胁比英国本身的威胁还大。我们的斗争是针对整个北大西洋公约组织军队的。
    今年5月，我们成立了怯尼亚非洲民族联盟作为我国解放运动的先锋队。怯尼亚非洲民族联盟主张立即组织我国的人民群众，为现在就获得绝对的民族独立而英勇地斗争。怯尼亚人民通过怯尼亚非洲民族联盟，了解到，必须通过组织群众实现团结和统一来争得我们的自由。这就是我们从现在直到明年2月我们大选时的任务。
    在我国人民对英帝国主义者进行斗争的时候，历史也在按着它自然的道路发展。由于历史已对殖民主义作出了判决，无论野蛮的武力还是搞假独立那种恶毒的花招都挽救不了它注定的失败命运。我们亚非两洲的人民是历史所作的判决的执行官，因此，在1960年（即非洲的决定年）我们目击帝国主义在非洲打着哆嗦从一个失败走向另一个失败。
    不久以前，我们刚果的弟兄们在进行了英勇的斗争之后获得了独立。但是帝国主义——集体帝国主义——在华盛顿的策谋下，企图在刚果独立的婴孩时期便扼死它。如各位所知，这个阴谋已告失败。
    受到美帝国主义威胁的不仅是刚果，而且是整个的非洲。怯尼亚受着美帝国主义的严重威胁。
    亲爱的朋友们，亚非两洲的人民有着共同的历史。他们都曾遭受帝国主义的侵略。亚洲实际上已经自由，而非洲仍然是殖民主义的堡垒。但是非洲有着现实的机会从亚洲的兄弟那里吸取经验。你们的斗争过去是，现在仍然是我们的斗争，你们的经验就是我们的经验。我们之所以对你们自从你们的英勇斗争以来所做的获有如此深切的印象，其原因就在这里。
    仅仅吸取经验还不够。我们必须加强和巩固我们的队伍来对付帝国主义的阴谋。亚非两洲过去都曾有过光辉的历史，这种历史现在必须恢复和得到新生。在万隆，诞生了非亚团结的精神。1957年在开罗，这一精神得到了加强。今天我们是你们的客人，明天，你们定将在一个自由、独立的怯尼亚受到欢迎。我们现在就发出这个邀请，因为我们确信，我们的斗争很快就会获得胜利。同时，我们谨请你们继续支持我们争取现在就独立和释放我们卓越的领袖乔莫·肯雅塔的斗争。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    自由、独立的非洲万岁！
    乔莫·肯雅塔和怯尼亚万岁！
    非洲团结万岁！
    全世界和平和友谊万岁！
    他们的讲话受到了极其热烈的欢迎。讲话以后，大会通过电文，支持怯尼亚人民的斗争。
    今天的大会是由中国亚非团结委员会、中国非洲友好协会联合举办的。参加大会的有：中国亚非团结委员会副主席刘宁一，中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南，中国非洲人民友好协会副会长徐平羽，中华全国总工会书记处书记康永和，全国妇联副主席刘清扬，中国亚非团结委员会秘书长朱子奇，副秘书长杨朔，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副秘书长王明远，中国非洲人民友好协会总干事吴青和全国青联的代表等。
