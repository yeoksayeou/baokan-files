    Resolutely Go Deep into the Front Line of Production
    Luo Tian, First Secretary of the Shantou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Guangdong

    Since the Shantou Prefectural Committee formulated the "Six Regulations on Improving Cadre Style and Strengthening Agricultural Production" in mid-May, in accordance with the directives of the Party Central Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Committee on improving cadre style and strengthening agricultural production, more than 46,000 cadres at the prefectural, county, commune, and brigade levels have gone deep into the front line of production. Although the time has not been long, it has already caused tremendous changes in the ideological style of cadres and the entire rural production outlook, showing a completely new atmosphere.

    Many cadres, after going deep down, have profound feelings and reflect, "The eyes see more clearly; the ears hear more keenly." "In the past, squatting in the office was like sitting in a well and looking at the sky; now, going deep down is like climbing a mountain and looking at the sea." The broad masses of people particularly warmly welcome cadres going to the countryside to settle down and go deep into production. Some said, "Since the comrades came, there have been three major changes: a big change in production, turning bad crops into good crops; a big change in cadres, everyone goes to work; a big change in the canteen, life is good every day." Some masses also posted big-character posters to praise the cadres: "The secretary is different when he comes down, leading the cadres to change their style, grasping production and life well, and making production red-hot like fire."

    Should leading cadres go mainly to advanced areas or to backward areas when they go to the front line of production? Based on the specific situation in the Shantou area, the Prefectural Committee decided that, for a certain period of time, it would concentrate its main leadership force on grasping the backward areas, advocating that Party cadres go to backward areas to strengthen weak links, in order to quickly change the face of backward areas. At the same time, it also separated a certain leadership force to go deep into the original advanced areas and advanced units, to promptly summarize and promote advanced experience, and to seek a more comprehensive and balanced development of production and work, in order to adapt to the needs of the current new situation of socialist construction in the entire region. The entire region concentrated hundreds of county party secretaries and county party committee members, 360 cadres at the section and bureau chief level, and all commune party committee first secretaries, 1,340 commune cadres, and went deep into 857 backward production brigades to settle down. In just two short months, they have initially changed the backwardness of 617 backward brigades, and have influenced and promoted the teams in an intermediate state as well as the original advanced areas, causing major changes in the entire rural situation.

    Some comrades believe that backward areas are only a small minority and cannot play a decisive role in the work. Therefore, as long as they go deep into the advanced areas and grasp the advanced, they can drive the intermediate and promote the backward, and there is no need to go deep into the backward areas. This is not right. Our leadership method should be "grasping both ends and bringing along the middle." Only grasping the advanced and not grasping the backward is a kind of one-sidedness. Of course, only grasping the backward and not grasping the advanced, not grasping the pacesetters, and not promoting the experience of advanced models, so that the backward catch up with the advanced and the advanced become even more advanced, is also a kind of one-sidedness. Experience proves that only by removing these two kinds of one-sidedness, starting from different regions, different times, and different actual situations, specifically applying the leadership method of "grasping both ends and bringing along the middle," and in grasping both ends well, comparatively concentrating on grasping the main end, while also separating a certain force to grasp the other end, can we constantly discover new things, support the development of new things, constantly solve the unbalanced state of development between the backward and the advanced, and promote the comprehensive development and comprehensive sustained leap forward of the entire socialist construction.

    Cadres going to the front line of production should not only have a strong fighting will and appear as ordinary laborers, but also be good at discovering problems through participating in production, be good at analyzing and grasping the main contradictions and the main aspects of contradictions in the work, and earnestly solve them, so that all aspects of work can achieve high-speed development. Wherever this is done, the enthusiasm of the broad masses is quickly mobilized, and the work can quickly win the initiative. Tian Rongshen, the first secretary of the Chao'an County Party Committee, moved to the Hongxing Brigade of the Caitang Commune after settling down. He ate in the canteen and effectively helped to run the canteen well. He discussed with cadres and the masses to arrange the members' rations well. The canteen expanded its vegetable plots by 34 mu, expanded the planting of miscellaneous grains on marginal land by 39 mu, and established comprehensive processing plants for rice milling, oil extraction, wine making, and soy sauce making, which increased the amount of cooking oil and vegetables. He also rebuilt the coal-fired continuous stoves. The masses saw that the cadres had done good things for the masses, and their enthusiasm was very high. They actively participated in the improvement of the canteen, which further consolidated the canteen and further improved the enthusiasm for summer harvest and summer planting.

    After a large number of leading cadres went deep into the front line of production, participated in production, and led production, some people believe that going deep into one point makes it difficult to take care of the overall situation, and doing the central work makes it difficult to do the departmental work at the same time. Or they believe that the party committees at all levels are often dispersed in the front line, and collective leadership is difficult to maintain. Therefore, they doubt whether cadres going deep into the front line can be sustained for a long time. This is an incorrect idea and an unnecessary concern. Of course, after the cadres go deep into the front line, there are indeed many new specific leadership method problems that need to be systematically solved, but it must be affirmed that only by adhering to going deep into the front line can these problems be solved well.

    Meigang Commune in Jieyang County has initially and relatively well solved this problem through practical exploration. In solving the problem of combining point and surface, they adopted the approach of always adhering to going deep into the key points, and through conscientiously doing a good job in the key points, dissecting the sparrow, quickly discovering problems, and creating experience, to strengthen the guidance of the overall work. On the other hand, while doing a good job in the key points, the leaders also separated a certain amount of time (such as one day out of every five days) to check and arrange work on the surface, and through the regular meetings of the commune party committee and standing committee, exchanged information on the overall situation, and studied and solved the problems of the surface work. In this way, not only was the contradiction between grasping the point and grasping the surface after the leaders went deep solved, but also, because of going deep to do a good job in the key points and frequently obtaining direct experience, the past problem of generalizing the arrangement of work was more effectively overcome, and the guidance of the overall work became more specific.

    In solving the relationship between the central work and the departmental work, the primary key is that each department must establish and adhere to the guiding ideology of serving agriculture. Each period puts forward plans that revolve around serving agriculture and carrying out departmental work. When the party committee arranges work, the party committee uniformly arranges departmental work, and the inspection of work is also unified. Secondly, each department is contracted to do a good job in one brigade as the key point of the department. Within the key point, it is contracted to do a good job in the central work and create specific experience in each department's work, which is comprehensively promoted. Third, in order to solve the special business activities of the departments, the leaders set aside a certain amount of time for each department to check and arrange work.

    On the issue of how to maintain collective leadership after going deep down, the first is to establish a responsibility system at all levels. The party committee secretary is responsible for the front, the standing committee member is responsible for the unit, the party committee member is responsible for the brigade, the brigade general branch member is responsible for the production team, and the branch member is responsible for the production group. Secondly, major principled issues are discussed and decided by the standing committee or the party committee, general work is decided by the secretary in charge, and daily affairs are handled by the business departments. Major policy principled issues that need to be solved by each department should be reported for instructions. Third, the standing committee holds regular or temporary meetings as needed to study and handle major issues. Doing so will not only not weaken collective leadership, but also, because the responsibility system is strengthened, each responsible cadre goes deep down, grasps the situation, and creates experience. When the collective studies and solves problems, it will be more comprehensive, more practical, and faster, thereby further strengthening collective leadership.

    As for the specific leadership methods of the county party committee and the prefectural party committee after going deep into the front line, preliminary experience has also been explored. Some county party committees adopt the "two-eight" system, and some adopt the "three-seven" system, that is, they spend eight days or seven days going deep into the grassroots to work and labor, and spend two days or three days to concentrate on studying, holding meetings, studying and arranging work and departmental activities. We are convinced that with continuous practice and exploration, a set of specific leadership methods that adapt to the new situation will definitely be created and gradually improved.

    坚决深入生产第一线	中共广东汕头地委第一书记　罗天
    汕头地委根据党中央和广东省委关于改进干部作风与加强农业生产的指示精神，于5月中旬作出“关于改进干部作风的六项规定”以来，已经有地、县、公社、大队四级干部四万六千余人深入到生产第一线。时间虽然不长，但是已经引起了干部思想作风和整个农村生产面貌的巨大变化，出现了一派崭新气象。
    不少干部深入下去之后，都有深切的感受，反映说：“眼睛看得清了；耳朵听得灵了。”“过去蹲在机关，有如坐井观天，现在深入下去，好比登山望海。”广大群众对于干部的下乡落户，深入生产，特别热烈欢迎。有的说：“同志来后有三大变化：生产大变化，坏禾变好禾；干部大变化，个个去劳动；食堂大变化，生活天天好。”有的群众还贴出大字报来赞扬干部：“书记下来就不同，带领干部改作风，生产生活抓得好，生产搞得火样红。”
    领导干部到生产第一线，究竟主要是到先进地区、还是到落后的地区去呢？地委根据汕头地区的具体情况，确定在目前的一定时间内，集中主要的领导力量着重抓后进，提倡党的干部到后进地区，加强薄弱环节，以便迅速改变后进地区的面貌，与此同时，还分出一定的领导力量深入原来的先进地区、先进单位，及时总结和推广先进经验，求得生产和工作比较全面平衡的发展，以适应当前全区社会主义建设新形势的需要。全区集中了数百名县委书记和县委委员，三百六十名科局长的干部和全部的公社党委第一书记，一千三百四十名公社干部，深入到八百五十七个后进生产大队去安家落户。仅在短短的两个月时间内，便初步改变了六百一十七个后进大队的落后面貌，并且影响和推动了处于中间状态的队以及原来的先进地区，使整个农村形势起了重大的变化。
    有些同志认为后进地区只是极少数，对工作起不了决定作用，因而只要深入先进，抓住先进，就可以带动中间，推动落后，而不必要深入到落后地区去，这是不对的。我们的领导方法应该是“抓两头，带中间”，只抓先进，不抓后进，这是一种片面性。当然，只抓后进，不抓先进，不抓标兵，不推广先进典型的经验，使后进赶先进，先进的更先进，那也是一种片面性。经验证明，只有去掉这两种片面性，从不同地区、不同时间、不同实际情况出发，具体运用“抓两头，带中间”的领导方法，在抓好两头当中，比较集中地抓住主要的一头，同时又分出一定力量，抓好另一头，才能不断地发现新事物，扶植新事物的发展，不断地解决后进与先进的发展不平衡状态，促进整个社会主义建设的全面发展，全面的持续跃进。
    干部到生产第一线，不仅应该有坚强的战斗意志，以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现，而且要善于通过参加生产发现问题，善于分析与抓住工作中的主要矛盾与矛盾的主要方面，并认真地予以解决，使各方面工作获得高速度的发展。凡是这样做了的地方，那里广大群众的积极性就被迅速地调动起来，工作就能迅速争得主动。潮安县委第一书记田荣申，搬到彩塘公社红星大队落户以后，在食堂吃饭，并且切实地帮助把食堂办好，他和干部群众商量，安排好社员口粮，食堂扩大种植菜地三十四亩，利用五边地扩种杂粮三十九亩，建立起碾米、榨油、酿酒、制酱油等综合加工厂，增加了食油和食菜数量，还改建了烧煤连环灶。群众看到干部为群众办了好事，情绪十分高涨，都积极参加食堂的改进工作，使食堂获得了进一步巩固，更加提高了夏收夏种的生产积极性。
    在大批领导干部深入到生产第一线，参加生产，领导生产之后，有人认为深入了点就难以照顾全面，做了中心工作，就难以同时做好部门工作。或者认为各级党委经常分散在第一线，集体领导就难以坚持，因而，怀疑干部深入第一线是否能长期坚持下去。这是一种不正确的想法和多余的顾虑。当然，在干部深入第一线后，确有许多新的具体领导方法问题，需要系统地进行解决，但是，必须肯定只有坚持深入第一线，这些问题才能解决得好。
    揭阳县枚岗公社经过实践摸索，已初步地、比较好地解决了这一问题。在解决点与面结合的问题上，他们采取一方面始终坚持深入重点，通过认真搞好重点，解剖麻雀，迅速发现问题，创造经验，来加强对全面工作的指导。另方面，在搞好重点的同时，领导又分出一定的时间（比如每五天中分出一天）到面上检查布置工作，并通过公社党委、常委的定期碰头开会，交流全面的情况，研究解决面的工作问题。这样就不仅解决了领导深入之后，既要抓点又要抓面的矛盾，而且由于深入搞好重点，经常地取得直接的经验，就更有效地克服了过去布置工作一般化的毛病，对全面工作的指导更加具体了。
    在解决中心工作与部门工作关系的问题上，首要的关键是各部门要确立坚持为农业服务的指导思想，每个时期提出围绕为农业服务和开展部门工作的计划，在党委布置工作时，由党委统一布置部门工作，检查工作时也统一检查。其次，各部门都包干搞好一个大队，作为部门的重点，在重点内既包干搞好中心工作，又创造每个部门工作的具体经验，予以全面推广。第三，为了解决部门的特殊业务活动，领导划出一定的时间给各部门检查和布置工作。
    在深入下去如何坚持集体领导的问题上，首先是要层层建立责任制，党委书记包战线，常委包单元，党委委员包大队，大队总支委员包生产队，支部委员包生产小组。其次，重大原则问题由常委会或党委会讨论决定，一般工作，由分管书记决定，日常事务由业务部门处理，各部门要解决的重大政策原则问题，要请示报告。第三，常委会定期或根据需要临时召开会议，研究处理重大问题。这样做，不但不会削弱集体领导，而且由于责任制的加强，每个负责干部都深入下去，掌握了情况，创造了经验，当集体研究解决问题时，就更全面，更实际，更迅速了，从而更加加强了集体领导。
    至于县委和地委两级深入第一线后的具体领导方法，也已摸索出初步的经验。有的县委采用“二八”制，有的采用“三七”制，即以八天或七天的时间深入基层劳动和工作，以二天或三天的时间集中学习、开会，研究布置工作和部门活动。我们确信，随着不断的实践和摸索，一套适应新形势的具体领导方法，一定可以创造出来，并日臻完善。
