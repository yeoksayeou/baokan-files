    Building a Family Through Hard Work	Chang Zheng, Zhen Hua, Zhao Huaiqing
    As long as there are people, anything can be done
    Let people live in houses and no longer endure the sun and rain. This is the wish that construction workers have long been excited about. However, this is not like the inland, where lime, wood, bricks, and cement are rare treasures. How difficult it would be to build high-rise buildings from scratch! "However, relying on ready-made things in everything, what kind of style is that? As long as there are people, anything can be done." People working in Qaidam have set their ambitions in this way.
    In the spring of 1959, coldness sealed the earth in the Qaidam Basin. Communist Party member Yu Chunxiang from the construction company led a group of workers to the banks of Sugan Lake to cut reeds to replace wood. The lake was full of ice ridges. Yu Chunxiang gave the few pairs of long rubber boots he had to comrades who were weaker. He ignored the bone-chilling ice and snow and waded into the water, going wherever the reeds were thickest. When he couldn't bear it any longer, he came up to warm himself by the fire and then went back down. In a few days, his feet were completely cracked. In the evening, they didn't stop, limping around looking for discarded iron wires to bind the reed bundles for the arched roofs. In about a month, ten of them obtained more than 90,000 catties of reeds. Now, there are tens of thousands of square meters of "three-no" (no cement, wood, or bricks) houses that are warm in winter and cool in summer in the Leng Hu area. These are built one after another because people are not afraid of hardship and work selflessly.
    Heroic deeds of starting from scratch are countless! One morning, when a blizzard swept across the mountains, Liang Zhiqing, an old Communist Party member in his fifties, and a group of young workers came to a remote mountain valley. They were going to build a lime factory here. But how to build a factory and burn lime was unclear to anyone. The young men stared at Liang Zhiqing expectantly. Liang Zhiqing knew the weight on his shoulders. He buried his head day and night, comparing and drawing, thinking hard about how to burn lime. During the day, he went up the mountain with the young men to carry stones, sweat streaming down his spine and eyebrows. On the way, when others rested, he climbed up the hillside to break willow branches; at night, when others were asleep, he was still weaving carrying baskets. When they started burning lime, everyone got up before dawn and stayed up late, working very hard, but the lime they burned was all half-cooked. They held "Zhuge Liang" meetings again and again, and improved the kiln body and operation methods several times, finally burning the lime quickly, and the output increased sharply. In this way, they didn't ask the state for a penny, but they created a large amount of wealth for the country. Then, they rushed to make many iron tools: trowels, tile knives, iron shovels, etc.
    When they started building houses, they used gasoline drums piled up to replace the scaffolding because there was no scaffolding; they used reed bundles to replace wood because there was no wood. It was not easy to build a canteen, but a level 8 gale blew the roof off. The workers were sad, but no one was discouraged, "Start from scratch again!" In the dark and cold night, they lit dry grass as lamps and fought hard until dawn, and the roof of the canteen arched up again.
    The Qaidam-style houses with distinctive features have been completed one after another. It is as if a poem says: "Suddenly, like a spring breeze overnight, thousands of trees and thousands of pear trees bloom." When you walk into Leng Hu Hospital and see the long corridor, the snow-white walls, and the spacious and comfortable wards, how can you imagine that just over a year ago, this was a Gobi desert with yellow sand rolling around.
          "Gobi Golden Lotus"
    A hydrochloric acid plant stands in the emerging oil city of Leng Hu. It is like a dazzling "golden lotus" in the sea, and also the most beautiful hymn praising the heroic builders who started from scratch.
    Leng Hu Oilfield is continuing to advance. Every tile and brick here is permeated with the wisdom and sweat of the builders. Everyone who has been to Leng Hu Oilfield knows that here, when crude oil flows out of the ground through oil wells like a fountain, it is often blocked by rock debris, which needs a large amount of hydrochloric acid to corrode it and keep the oil path open. This is called "acidification." In the past, the hydrochloric acid needed here had to be transported from other places through long transportation lines, which often could not guarantee timely supply.
    In early 1959, tens of thousands of petroleum fighters gathered in Leng Hu and invested in an unprecedentedly fierce battle to seize oil. One production well after another spewed out crude oil. The telephone bell of the material warehouse of the Qinghai Petroleum Administration Equipment Manufacturing Department rang with unprecedented frequency. "Hello! Material warehouse? Has the hydrochloric acid arrived?" "Hello, hello! Didn't you say you would allocate it to us today? It has already affected production!..." Complaints were constantly heard from the receiver. The material worker Shi Guixiang of the equipment warehouse felt sad when he heard people's urgent urging: Can't we just wait for people to deliver the materials to our door and then send them out? Can't we just watch hydrochloric acid drag down the great leap forward? At the swearing-in meeting at the end of last year to ensure a good start to this year, he suddenly ran to the stage and said loudly to the audience: Our material workers guarantee a sufficient supply of hydrochloric acid, we can definitely do it! But when he returned to his seat, his head swelled. Ha! My measures are not specific enough, why did I yell it out? From then on, he was preoccupied day and night. Thinking and thinking, once, he suddenly remembered that he had heard many years ago that hydrochloric acid was made from brine. He told his ideas to the Party branch, and immediately received enthusiastic support. The branch immediately transferred three porters, Zhou Fugui and others, to help him.
    However, then a series of problems arose: where does the brine come from, how to build the furnace?
    After several experiments, no effective method has been found. One day, I saw in the newspaper that the water of Chaka Salt Lake could be boiled into brine (magnesium chloride), which made everyone very happy. They disregarded the cold weather and took a bus to Chaka Salt Lake overnight. After two days and one night, the car returned to Leng Hu, carrying brine, carrying their full confidence and hope.
    Building the furnace began, and they ran around to various units to find jars and altars, which were all their belongings. Night followed day, and day followed night, and they finally made hydrochloric acid. A hydrochloric acid plant with ten kilns stands majestically on the Gobi Desert.
    The hydrochloric acid plant has been officially put into production, but Shi Guixiang and his partners are not satisfied. They took out the energy of building the hydrochloric acid plant and vigorously carried out technical innovation. Originally, their factory was all manual operation. After technical innovation, the degree of mechanization was improved, which increased production efficiency by 28 times and saved 120 laborers.

    刻苦兴家	昌政  振华　赵淮青
    只要有人，什么都能办到
    让人们能住上房子，别再忍受烈日的曝晒和风雨的吹打，这是建筑工人们早已激动在胸中的心愿。但是，这里不比内地，石灰、木料、砖瓦、水泥……都是稀有的宝贝。要平地起家建起高楼大厦该是多么不容易呵！“可是，事事找现成，那算什么风格，只要有人，什么都能办到。”工作在柴达木的人就这样立下了雄心壮志。
    1959年春天，在柴达木盆地，寒冷封锁着大地。建筑公司共产党员于纯祥带着一伙工人来到苏干湖畔，割芦苇代替木料。湖边结满了冰凌，于纯祥把仅有的几双长统胶靴分给身体较弱的同志，自己不顾冰雪澈骨趟进水里，哪儿苇子粗就往哪儿去，实在支持不住了，上来烤烤火又下去。不几天，脚上全冻裂开了口子。到了晚上，他们马不停蹄，又跛着脚找寻报废的铁丝，用来绑扎拱屋顶的苇把。月把时间，他们十来个人搞到九万多斤芦苇。现在，冷湖地区有几万平方米冬暖夏凉的“三不用”（不用水泥、木材、砖瓦）的房屋，就是由于人们这样不怕艰苦和忘我劳动，一幢一幢地建造起来的。
    白手起家的英雄事迹何止万千！在一个暴风雪横扫着山野的早晨，五十多岁的老共产党员梁志清和一群年轻工人，来到一个顶偏僻的山沟，他们要在这儿建设一座石灰厂。但怎样才能建起厂来烧出石灰，谁心里也没底。小伙子们眼巴巴瞅着梁志清。梁志清知道自己肩膀上的份量，他整天整夜地埋下头比着、划着，苦苦地思谋着怎样把石灰烧出来。白天，他跟小伙子们一起上山背石头，汗水顺着他的脊梁、眉毛一个劲地往下流。路上，别人休息了，他还爬上山坡折柳条子；晚上，别人都睡了，他还在编抬筐和背斗。开始烧石灰了，大伙起五更、熬半夜，忙得够呛，可是烧出来的石灰全是半生不熟的。他们一次又一次地开“诸葛亮”会，几次改进窑身和操作方法，终于把石灰很快地烧制出来，产量一股劲儿地往上升。就这样，他们没要国家一文钱，却为国家创造了大批的财富。接着，他们又赶制了许多铁工具：抹子、瓦刀、铁锨等。
    开始盖房时，没有脚手架，就用汽油筒垒起来代替；没有木料，就用芦苇把子代替，好不容易才盖好了一座食堂，可是一场八级风把屋顶揭跑啦。工人们心里难过，可谁也没泄气，“重起炉灶另开张！”漆黑严寒的夜晚，他们燃起干草当灯使，苦战到天明，食堂的屋顶又拱起来了。
    带着鲜明特点的柴达木式的房子，一片片落成了。真如一首古诗里所说的：“忽如一夜东风展，千树万树梨花开。”当你走进冷湖医院，看见那长长的走廊，雪白的粉壁，还有宽敞舒适的病房，你怎么能想到，一年多前这里还是一片黄沙滚滚的戈壁滩呢。
          “戈壁金莲”
    一座盐酸厂矗立在新兴的石油城——冷湖，它像大海中一朵耀眼的“金莲”，也是一支颂扬英雄的建设者们白手起家的最美好的赞歌。
    冷湖油田在继续前进，这儿的一片瓦，一块砖，都渗透着建设者的智慧和汗珠。到过冷湖油田的人都知道，在这里，当原油像喷泉一样通过油井流出地面时，常常因岩屑的阻塞挡住油路，需要大批盐酸浸蚀它，使油路畅通，这叫做“酸化”。以前，这里需要的盐酸都要通过漫长的交通线从外地运进来，常常不能保证供应及时。
    1959年初，成千上万的石油战士集中冷湖，投入了空前激烈的夺油大战。一口接着一口的生产井喷出原油。青海石油管理局器材制造处材料库的电话铃声空前频繁。“喂！器材库吗？盐酸运到了没有？”“喂喂！不是说今天就拨给我们吗？已经影响生产啦！……”听筒里不断传出埋怨的声音。器材库的材料工施桂祥同志一听见人们的火急催促，心里就难过地想：难道我们光会等人把材料送上门，再送出去吗？难道我们眼看着盐酸拖住大跃进的后腿吗？去年末一次确保今年开门红的誓师大会上，他突然跑上讲台向全场高声说：我们材料工保证把盐酸供应充足，我们一定能办到！但是，当他回到座位以后，脑袋发胀了。呵！我的措施还不够具体，怎么就嚷出来了呢？从那以后，他白天黑夜心事重重。想呵想呵，一次，他突然想起多年前他听说过盐酸是用卤块熬出来的。他把自己的想法告诉了党支部，立即受到了热烈的支持。支部当场就抽调周富贵等三个搬运工去帮助他。
    可是，接着又产生了一连串的问题：卤块从哪儿来，炉子怎样砌？
    经过几次试验，还没找出有效办法。一天，在报上看到察尔汗湖水可以熬成卤块（氯化镁）的消息，可把大伙乐透了。他们顾不得天寒地冻，连夜搭车直奔察尔汗湖。两天一夜后，汽车载着卤块，载着他们满怀的信心和希望，返回冷湖。
    建炉开始了，他们几个人跑遍了各单位找来罐罐坛坛，这就是他们的全部家当。夜晚接着白天，白天接着夜晚，他们终于把盐酸制出来了。一个拥有十个焖炉的盐酸厂巍然矗立在戈壁滩上。
    盐酸厂正式投入生产了，但施桂祥和他的伙伴们并不满足，他们拿出建设盐酸厂的劲头又大搞技术革新。原来，他们的工厂全部是手工操作，经过技术革新，提高了机械化程度，就使生产效率提高了二十八倍，节约劳力一百二十人。
