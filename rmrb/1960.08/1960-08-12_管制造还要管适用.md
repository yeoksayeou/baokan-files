    Managing Manufacturing Also Requires Managing Applicability
    Agricultural machinery factories are at the forefront of industry supporting agriculture. How should agricultural machinery factories better undertake the task of supporting agriculture? The news about the Yunnan Province Menglang County Machinery Factory supporting agriculture, published in today's newspaper, puts forward a very important principle: not only should they guarantee the completion of the task of manufacturing agricultural machinery; but also guarantee that these agricultural machinery products are all applicable to agricultural production.
    Applicability, it seems, has two aspects. One is to guarantee a certain quality; the other is to be able to adapt to the needs of different regions and different agricultural conditions.
    Some people always think that the manufacturing technology of agricultural machinery is relatively simple, and the quality requirements are not that high, so they don't pay much attention to the product quality of agricultural machinery. This view is obviously wrong. All kinds of agricultural machinery products have certain quality standards that must be strictly followed. Agricultural machinery products that do not meet this quality standard, even if only one screw is of poor quality, or is not installed firmly, and is lost during transportation, will cause trouble to farmers and affect the support for agricultural production. It can be seen that to better support agriculture, agricultural machinery factories must not only guarantee the quantity of products, but also guarantee the quality of products.
    Guaranteeing the quality of products is only the most basic aspect of applicability. Equally important is to make agricultural machinery products adapt to the needs of different regions and different agricultural conditions. There are many agricultural tasks throughout the year, from planting to harvesting, from the fields to the farmland, and even the processing of various agricultural and sideline products, the need for agricultural machinery and tools is diverse. The harvesting and planting tools for the same crops also have different requirements in terms of performance and structure in the South and the North, in mountainous areas and plains. Moreover, with the continuous development of agricultural technology, agricultural tools that were applicable in the past may not be applicable now. For example, after the implementation of deep plowing and close planting in agriculture, the original plows, harrows and sowing machines must be transformed accordingly. It can be seen that to truly support agriculture, it is also necessary to continuously transform agricultural machinery products according to the needs of agricultural production development, making each manufactured item applicable, and every item applicable, according to the time and place.
    How can we achieve that every item is applicable? The Menglang County Machinery Factory also provided us with some good experiences. There is an old Chinese saying, "The deeper you know it, the more you love it." Only by educating all employees to deeply understand that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and making them deeply appreciate the great significance of supporting agriculture with agricultural machinery, and consciously realize how glorious a task they shoulder, can they consider the future use of each product when manufacturing it, thereby continuously improving product quality and improving product performance. Many specific practices of the Menglang County Machinery Factory, such as strictly implementing the product quality inspection system, vigorously carrying out the "three combinations" (workers, cadres, and technicians), going to the countryside to solicit farmers' opinions on products, and carrying out high-quality competitions, are all based on this ideological foundation. Let the principle of "agriculture is the foundation of the national economy" take root in the hearts of the vast number of agricultural machinery manufacturing workers, and we will certainly be able to support agriculture with more and better agricultural machinery.

### 管制造还要管适用

    管制造还要管适用
    农业机械厂是站在工业支援农业的最前线的。农业机械厂应该怎样更好地担负起支援农业的任务呢？今天本报发表的云南省?江县机械厂支援农业的新闻，提出了一条很重要的原则，这就是：不仅要保证完成制造农业机械的任务；而且要保证这些农业机械都能适用于农业生产。
    所谓适用，看来有两个方面的内容。一是保证一定的质量；一是能适应不同地区不同农情的需要。
    有些人总以为农业机械的制造技术比较简单，质量要求不是那么高的，因而不太注意农业机械的产品质量，这种看法显然是不对的。各种各样的农业机械产品，都有一定的、必须严格遵守的质量标准。达不到这个质量标准的农业机械产品，即便是只有一个螺丝质量不好，或是安得不牢固，在运送途中丢失了，也会给农民造成麻烦，影响对农业生产的支援。可见，农业机械厂要更好地支援农业，不仅要保证产品的数量，而且要保证产品的质量。
    保证产品的质量，还只是适用的最基本的一条。同样重要的，是要使农业机械产品适应不同地区不同农情的需要。一年四季的农活很多，从种到收，从地里到田间，以至于各种农副产品的加工，对农业机具的需要是多种多样的。同样农作物的收割和播种工具，南方和北方，山区和平原，在性能和结构的要求上也不完全一样。而且随着农业技术的不断发展，过去适用的农具，现在也可能就不适用了。如农业实行深耕密植以后，原有的犁耙和播种机具就得随着加以改造。可见，要切切实实地支援农业，还必须因时因地地不断根据农业生产发展的需要，对农业机械产品进行改造，使其制造一件，适用一件，件件适用。
    怎样才能做到件件适用呢？?江县机械厂也给我们提供了一些很好的经验。中国有句老话，“知之愈深，爱之愈切”。只有教育全体职工深刻地认识农业是国民经济的基础，使他们深切地体会到用农业机械支援农业的重大意义，自觉地认识到自己肩负着多么光荣的任务，才能在制造每一件产品的时候，就考虑到它将来的使用情况，从而不断地提高产品质量，改善产品性能。?江县机械厂的许多具体的做法，例如严格产品质量的检验制度，大搞“三结合”，下乡访问征求农民对产品的意见，开展优质竞赛等等，都是建立在这个思想基础上的。让“农业是国民经济的基础”的方针，在广大的农业机械制造工人心里扎根，我们就一定能用更多更好的农业机械支援农业。
