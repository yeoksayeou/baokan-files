    Record of the Victory in Fighting the Flood and Carrying out Emergency Rescue on the Liao River
    Liu Yiyun
    For several days, heavy rain poured down, and the vast expanse of water connected communes and villages. The Liao River roared, violently splitting the gloomy clouds. The torrential flow surged for hundreds of miles, with even greater force in the downstream areas. The river堤堤 (dī) frequently reported emergencies, and breaches presented dangerous situations. The entire population quickly mobilized to fight against nature. Under the orders of the Municipal Party Committee, support gathered like clouds. The army dispatched warships, and civil aviation opened up steamer routes. Gaiping sent sailors, and Dalian flew speedboats. The stationed troops arrived upon hearing the news, and the militia set up camps in the wilderness. Daring to face boiling water and fire, how could the flood peak succeed? The more violently the river roared, the more fervent the sea of people became. The whirlpool at the breach was rapid, and the wisdom of the masses quickly arose. Wooden boats were sunk with huge stones, forming a mainstay in the middle of the stream. After a bitter struggle day and night, the breach was successfully blocked, and celebrations of success were held. Applause flew beyond the heavens, and cheers startled fish and birds. Joyfully, there was the power to turn the tide, and the sky cleared, and the river became docile. The water level gradually receded, and the Liao River returned to peace. The water is wide, and the heart is broad; the sky is high, and the white clouds are light. The vast estuary of the Liao River prospers on the coast of the Bohai Sea. The sea and river meet at this moment, and the evening glow is colorful and bright.

    记辽河抗洪抢险胜利
    刘异云几日倾盆雨，汪洋连社村。辽河起咆哮，凶猛裂阴云。激泻数百里，下游势更甚。河堤频告急，决口险象生。全民迅动员，与天作斗争。市委号令下，支援集如云。军队调兵舰，民航开汽轮。盖平派水手，大连飞快艇。驻军闻讯到，民兵扎野营。胆敢赴汤火，洪峰哪得逞？河水越狂啸，人海越沸腾。决口漩涡急，人多急智生。木船沉巨石，中流砥柱横。苦战昼连夜，堵口庆功成。掌声飞天外，欢呼鱼鸟惊。喜有回天力，天晴河亦驯。水位徐徐落，辽河复安宁。水阔心胸广，天高白云轻。浩荡辽河口，繁荣渤海滨。海河此际会，夕霞彩缤纷。
