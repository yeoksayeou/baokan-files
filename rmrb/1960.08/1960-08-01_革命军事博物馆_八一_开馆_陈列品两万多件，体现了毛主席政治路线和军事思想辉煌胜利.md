Xinhua News Agency, July 31st. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum will officially open to the public on August 1st. This grand museum was built to commemorate the glorious victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war and to conduct revolutionary tradition education for the broad masses of the people. The museum displays more than 20,000 cultural relics and photographs from various revolutionary war periods since the birth of the Chinese Communist Party and the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. It vividly reflects the glorious history of the Chinese people and their army, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, launching heroic and unyielding struggles against national enemies and class enemies, prominently embodying the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's correct political line and military thought, and systematically recording the heroic historical features of the People's Liberation Army's growth and strength.

The construction of this museum began on October 12, 1958, and was completed in two hundred and sixty-four working days.

In order to collect cultural relics from various revolutionary historical periods, the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, various military branches, and even every company organized preparatory committees or cultural relic collection teams, launching a mass movement of "everyone contributing treasures, and offering ideas if they have no treasures." In less than half a year, various units collected more than 143,500 pieces of cultural relics and photographs that had been identified and carefully selected. Subsequently, the officers and soldiers participating in the museum's construction, after five months of intense work, had initially established the exhibition of cultural relics before last year's National Day.

The military museum received enthusiastic participation and support from all over the country in its engineering construction, exhibit collection, and design and production. Twenty-one provinces and cities and 276 units across the country contributed a large amount of construction equipment and various technical personnel, and rushed to produce or process a large number of engineering and interior decoration accessories for the museum. Many provincial, municipal, county, and commune party committees organized offices for collecting cultural relics. Many responsible cadres and Communist Party members took the lead in contributing treasures and ideas. A large number of cultural relics from the Second Domestic Revolutionary War and the War of Resistance Against Japan, in addition to a portion preserved by responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee and senior generals and officers of the People's Liberation Army, many were treasured by the people of the old revolutionary bases, such as Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and northern Shaanxi, at the risk of their lives during the Kuomintang's reign of terror after the Red Army went north.

    革命军事博物馆“八一”开馆
    陈列品两万多件，体现了毛主席政治路线和军事思想辉煌胜利
    新华社31日讯　中国人民革命军事博物馆，定于8月1日正式开馆接待观众。这个规模宏伟的博物馆，是为了纪念中国人民革命战争的辉煌胜利和对广大人民进行革命传统教育而兴建的。博物馆内陈列着从中国共产党的诞生、第二次国内革命战争以来各个革命战争时期的文物、图片等两万多件，生动地反映了中国人民及其军队，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，向民族敌人和阶级敌人展开英勇不屈斗争的光辉史迹，突出地体现了毛主席正确的政治路线和军事思想的辉煌胜利和系统地记载了人民解放军成长壮大的英雄历史面貌。
    这座博物馆是在1958年10月12日破土动工，经过二百六十四个工作日便全部建成。
    为征集各个革命历史时期的文物，人民解放军总部、各军种、兵种领导机构直到每个连队，都组织了筹备委员会或文物征集组，掀起了“人人献宝，无宝献计”的群众性运动。在不足半年时间内，各单位便征集了经过鉴定和精选的文物、照片达十四万三千五百多件。以后，参加博物馆筹建工作的官兵，经过五个月的紧张工作，在去年国庆节前文物陈列已初具规模了。
    军事博物馆在工程建筑、展品征集和设计制作中，得到了全国各地的热烈参加和支援。全国有二十一个省市、二百七十六个单位抽出了大量的建筑器材和各种技术人员，并且为博物馆赶制或加工了大批的工程和内部装饰的配件。很多省、市、县和公社党委，组织了征集文物办公室。许多负责干部、共产党员带头献宝、献计。在第二次国内革命战争和抗日战争时期的大批文物，除一部分是党中央负责同志和人民解放军高级将领和官兵保存下来的以外，其中有许多是革命老根据地，江西、湖南、四川、云南、贵州、陕北等地的人民，当红军北上以后，在国民党恐怖统治年代里，冒着生命危险珍藏下来的。（附图片）
