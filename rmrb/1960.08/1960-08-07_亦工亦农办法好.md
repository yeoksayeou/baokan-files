Short Commentary:

    The method of being both worker and farmer adopted by the Tiemu Repair Factory of the Litianmu Commune in Cangxian County, Hebei Province, to meet the needs of agricultural production is a very meaningful thing.

    Perhaps some people will think that the production tasks of the commune-run industries are already very heavy. Will drawing labor to participate in agricultural labor affect the completion of industrial production tasks? The example of the Tiemu Repair Factory of the Litianmu Commune answers: As long as the law of the strong seasonality of agricultural production is followed and labor is arranged flexibly, it will not affect industrial production tasks. This Tiemu Factory adopted the method of "when agriculture is very busy, industry does little; when agriculture is slightly busy, industry does much," fully tapping labor resources. During the busiest time of agriculture, it drew 80% of the labor force to participate in agricultural labor, which did not affect industrial production. This shows that as long as we exert full effort and take specific measures to arrange labor flexibly, the problem can be solved.

    In fact, the significance of implementing "both worker and farmer" is not limited to providing labor for agricultural production. We know that industry and agriculture have an inherent connection. They affect and promote each other. Commune-run industries are an integral part of the people's commune, and its relationship with agriculture is even more so. After the Tiemu Repair Factory of the Litianmu Commune implemented the policy of "both worker and farmer," the cadres and workers frequently participated in agricultural production, further mastering the laws of agricultural production. Therefore, they combined industrial technological innovation and technological revolution more closely with agricultural technological transformation, and the industrial production plan was more in line with the needs of agricultural production. At the same time, they also used the convenience of participating in agricultural labor to train a large number of technical personnel for the commune production teams. As a result, it not only powerfully supported agricultural production but also improved industrial production. Isn't this a good thing that achieves many goals at once!

    The policy of "both worker and farmer" implemented by commune-run industries is beneficial to both agricultural and industrial production. It is also conducive to further strengthening the relationship between workers and peasants. That is to say, it has important economic significance and important political significance, and it is worthy of being promoted in all commune-run industries.

### 亦工亦农办法好

    亦工亦农办法好
    河北省沧县李天木公社铁木修配厂适应农业生产的需要，实行亦工亦农的办法，是一件很有意义的事情。
    也许有人会认为，现在社办工业的生产任务已很繁重了，再抽调人力参加农业劳动，会不会影响工业生产任务的完成？李天木公社铁木修配厂的事例回答了：只要根据农业生产季节性强的规律，灵活地安排劳动力，是不会影响工业生产任务的。这个铁木厂采取了“农业大忙，工业小干；农业小忙，工业大干”的方法，充分挖掘劳动力，在农业最忙的时候，抽出80％的人力参加农业劳动，并没有影响工业生产，这就说明，只要鼓足干劲，并且采取具体措施灵活地安排劳动力，问题是可以解决的。
    其实，实行“亦工亦农”的意义还不只限于为农业生产提供劳动力。我们知道，工业和农业本来就有着内在的联系，它们是相互影响、相互促进的，社办工业是人民公社的一个组成部分，它和农业的关系就更是如此。李天木公社铁木修配厂实行“亦工亦农”方针以后，由于干部、职工经常参加农业生产，进一步掌握了农业生产的规律性，因而把工业技术革新和技术革命同农业技术改造结合得更加紧密了，工业生产计划也更加符合农业生产的需要了；同时，利用参加农业劳动之便还为公社生产队培养了大量的技术人材。结果，不仅有力地支援了农业生产，而且也提高了工业生产。这岂不是一举数得的好事！
    社办工业实行“亦工亦农”的方针，既有利于农业生产，也有利于工业生产；还有利于进一步密切工农关系。也就是说，既有重要的经济意义，也有重要的政治意义，值得在一切社办工业当中推广。
