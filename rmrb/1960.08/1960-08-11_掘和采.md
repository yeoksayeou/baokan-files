    Excavating and Mining
    Bing Zhong
    For high coal production, excavation must come first. Because if we don't focus on excavation and fail to prepare coal mining work surfaces in a timely manner, we won't be able to mine coal. Furthermore, if the excavated footage is insufficient, and the number and length of coal mining work surfaces do not increase, continuous high coal production cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, vigorously focusing on excavation is a key to sustained leaps forward in coal mines.
    However, in production practice, excavation sometimes lags behind extraction. This is because: First, coal production is constantly leaping forward, and coal mining methods are constantly being innovated, thus continuously placing higher demands on excavation work. The relationship between excavation and extraction is also a development from balance to imbalance and then to a new balance. Second, the impact of excavation on extraction is often not immediately apparent. Focusing on extraction is about whether we can achieve high production in the present, while focusing on excavation is about whether we can maintain high production in the future. If you don't work with both hands, you won't place excavation and extraction on an equal footing, and will only focus on current production, causing excavation to lag behind extraction.
    On the surface, focusing on excavation doesn't seem as urgent for current high production as focusing on extraction. In reality, if we view the overall situation and measure comprehensively, both current and future high production are the results of vigorously focusing on excavation. If enterprise leaders do not have such a comprehensive perspective and separate the two, production will be put in a passive position.
    Simultaneously focusing on excavation and extraction is the key to sustained leaps forward. To foresee tomorrow today, to see the second step as we take the first, and to vigorously focus on preparations for the next stage of production as we focus on current production, even when excavation is ahead of extraction, we must not abandon it. Only in this way can we ensure normal coal production and sustained leaps forward.

    煤炭高产，掘进先行。因为不抓掘进，不能及时准备出采煤工作面来，就无法开采煤炭。而且掘进的进尺不够，采煤工作面的个数和长度不增加，也不能保证煤炭不断高产。所以大抓掘进，是煤矿持续跃进的一个关键。
    然而，在生产实践中，却有时会出现掘进落后于回采的情况。这是因为：第一、煤炭生产总是不断地跃进，采煤的方法总是在不断的革新，因而对掘进工作也就不断提出了更高的要求。掘进和回采的关系，也是由平衡到不平衡再到新的平衡的发展。第二、掘进对回采的影响往往不是立即就看出来的，抓回采是当前能否高产的事，抓掘进就是能否持续高产的事了。如果你不是两手去抓工作，就不会把掘进和回采摆在同等重要的地位，而只顾当前的生产，使掘进就落后于回采了。
    表面看来，抓掘进对于当前的高产并不像抓回采那样迫切，实际上如果通观全局，全面衡量，当前的高产和今后的高产，都是大抓掘进的结果。企业的领导干部如果没有这样一种全面观点，把两者割裂开来，就会使生产处于被动的境地。
    掘进回采同时抓，是持续跃进的关键。在今天就预见到明天，走第一步就看到第二步，像抓当前生产一样的大抓下一步的生产准备；即使当掘进比回采进度先进的时候，也不丢开不管。这才能保证煤炭正常生产和持续跃进。
