　　Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest Dispatch: Romanian workers have overfulfilled their August production tasks ahead of schedule to greet the 16th anniversary of Romania's liberation (August 23).

　　Workers at the Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej Clothing Factory in Bucharest, after greatly overfulfilling their August production plan ahead of schedule, are now working according to the October production plan. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has saved a total of 24.7 million lei (Romanian currency). The work team led by Ion Bia at the "Red Grivița" locomotive factory has been exceeding the production quota by 30% every day in August. Miners at the Ghelari iron mine are also rapidly moving into September, having mined an additional 1,000 tons of iron ore for the country since the beginning of August. Workers at the "Red Flag" Automobile Factory in Stalin City completed their gift task for the anniversary of the motherland's liberation ahead of schedule, fulfilling the guarantee to overproduce 20 automatic unloading trucks and forgings worth 200,000 lei by August 20.

　　Under the slogan "Presenting Gifts to August 23," a large number of construction workers have also completed a series of industrial enterprises ahead of schedule. Construction workers at the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine completed the nation's first 400-ton modern open-hearth furnace 42 days ahead of schedule. Construction workers at the "Borzești" Chemical Combine completed a workshop with an annual output of 30,000 tons of electrolytic alkali 40 days ahead of schedule.

The Bucharest Seamless Steel Pipe Factory has been completed and put into production two months ahead of schedule. The plywood workshop with an annual output of 18,000 cubic meters of plywood and the sawmilling workshop with an annual output of 67,000 cubic meters of timber at the Preajba Wood Processing Combine were also recently completed and put into production three months and three and a half months ahead of schedule, respectively.

　　Construction workers from many construction companies have also proposed guarantees to complete a batch of industrial enterprises ahead of schedule. Installation workers at the Luduș Sugar Factory in Stalin City guaranteed to complete the installation of this sugar factory with an annual output of 20,000 tons of sugar 15 days ahead of schedule, before August 23. Workers at the Fifth Construction Engineering Company in Stalin City guaranteed to complete the main buildings of a furniture factory and a textile factory sixty days and thirty days ahead of schedule, respectively.

　　Romanian workers launched a widespread socialist production emulation and technical innovation movement at the beginning of this year, proposing specific targets for increased production and savings. The number of young workers participating in the socialist production emulation alone reached 450,000, of whom 15,000 became technical innovation experts. 20% of the workers and technicians at the "Tractorul" Tractor Factory became innovators. Workers in Galați and Hunedoara counties proposed nearly 4,000 innovation proposals in the competition in the first half of this year, and based on the 1,700 innovation proposals that have already been adopted, the country can save 30 million lei annually. In national consumer goods industrial enterprises, employees saved 170 million lei in the first half of this year.

    今年来生产竞赛和技术革新运动获得巨大成就
    据新华社布加勒斯特电　罗马尼亚工人纷纷提前完成8月份生产任务，迎接罗马尼亚解放十六周年纪念日（8月23日）。
    布加勒斯特乔治乌—德治被服厂的工人在大大提前完成8月份生产计划后，现在已经在按10月份的生产计划来工作了。今年以来，这个工厂共节约了二千四百七十万列伊（罗币）。“红色格里维查”机车工厂由伊昂·比亚领导的工作队，在8月份每天都超额30％完成生产定额。盖拉尔铁矿的矿工也快马跨进9月，从8月初到现在，他们已经为国家多开采了一千吨铁矿石。斯大林城“红旗”汽车制造厂的工人提前完成了给祖国解放日的献礼任务，在8月20日完成了超额生产二十辆自动卸货卡车和价值二十万列伊的锻件的保证。
    广大的建筑工人在向“8月23日献礼”的口号下，也纷纷提前建成一系列工业企业。洪尼多阿拉冶金联合工厂的建筑工人提前四十二天建成了全国第一座四百吨的现代化的大平炉。“博尔泽斯蒂”化学联合工厂的建筑工人提前四十天建成了一座年产三万吨的电解碱车间。
    奥乃什蒂炼油厂最近提前四个半月安装好第二套催化裂化设备；尼科拉埃领导的安装小组以四天的时间就安装完了烟囱，这个任务原计划要四十五天才能完成。布加勒斯特有缝钢管厂已经提前两个月建成并投入生产。普雷阿日巴木材加工联合企业年产一万八千立方米胶合板的胶合板车间和年产六万七千立方米木板的锯板车间，也分别提前三个月和三个半月于最近建成并投入生产。
    许多建筑工程公司的建筑工人还提出保证提前建成一批工业企业。斯大林城路杜希制糖厂的安装工人保证提前十五天在8月23日以前安装完毕这个年产两万吨食糖的制糖厂。斯大林城第五建筑工程公司的工人保证分别提前六十天和三十天建成一个家俱厂的主要厂房和一个纺织厂。
    罗马尼亚广大工人在今年年初就展开了广泛的社会主义生产竞赛和技术革新运动，提出了具体的增产和节约指标。单是参加社会主义生产竞赛的青年工人就达四十五万人，其中，有一万五千人成了技术革新能手。“台尔曼”拖拉机工厂20％的工人和技术人员都成了革新者。加拉齐州和洪尼多阿拉州的工人在今年上半年的竞赛中共提出了近四千项革新建议，单就已经采用的一千七百项革新建议计算，全年可以为国家节约三千万列伊。在全国消费品工业企业中，职工们在今年上半年就节约了一亿七千万列伊。
