    To Systematize the Leadership Method of Going Deep into the Front Lines
    Fuxin Coal Mines Universally Implement the Underground Office System
    Political Work Becomes More In-Depth; Production Key Points Are Continuously Breakthrough; Good News Spreads Throughout the Mining Area
    According to Liaoning Daily news, Fuxin Coal Mines are rapidly and universally implementing the underground office system. In just over ten days, 134 underground (pit) offices have been established throughout the mining area, and more than 1,100 leading cadres at the level of pit section chiefs and above have moved to work in the underground (pit) offices. This makes the leadership method of going deep into the front lines regular and systematic, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the masses, and a vigorous new atmosphere has emerged in coal production.
    In May of this year, the leading cadres of the No. 8 Pit of the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine moved from working above ground to working underground. This improvement in leadership style greatly increased production. Coal production in June increased by more than 20% compared to the past, exceeding the state plan. After the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this experience, it believed that the underground office system is an effective method to adapt to the characteristics of coal production, improve leadership lagging behind the actual production, and a new development in leadership participating in and leading production. It required all industrial and mining enterprises in the city, especially all coal mines, to carefully study and rapidly promote it. The municipal party committee's call was enthusiastically responded to by the vast number of cadres in the coal mines. They acted overnight and set up offices in the underground one after another, setting up camps on the production front line. In less than three days, the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine built 32 underground offices made of grass sheds, mat sheds, and wooden boards on the flat ground under the open pit. More than 500 people, from the party secretary, mine manager, pit chief, section chief, to engineering and technical personnel, section cadres, and party and mass cadres, moved to work underground as a whole. The Pingan Mine, Xinqiu Mine, and Qinghemen Mine also launched a wave of office relocation, with leading cadres at all levels going deep into the tunnels, mining areas, and near the workplaces from the original above-ground locations. The underground office system was rapidly promoted throughout the mine.
    The underground office system produced remarkable results shortly after its implementation, changing the original leadership method of relying on meetings to listen to reports and using telephones to direct production. Instead, they frequently go deep into the production practice, to the workface and next to the electric pick to study and analyze the production situation, direct production on the spot, discover problems on the spot, and solve them using the "three-in-one combination" method on the spot. As a result, problems are handled quickly and well, many production key points have been broken through one after another, and new production good news continues to come. In the past, the coal miners of the No. 8 pit of the Pingan Mine did not cooperate closely enough between shifts, and production interruptions occurred every time shifts changed, sometimes shutting down production for two or three hours. Shi Lianfa, the party branch secretary of the pit, noticed this problem on the third day of working in the underground office. On the one hand, he strengthened ideological education for the workers of each shift, and on the other hand, he led everyone to formulate a "one-stop" shift handover system, implementing the method of handing over jobs on a job-to-job basis. Workers in each shift actively cooperated, eliminating the phenomenon of production stoppage due to shift handover, and coal production increased daily. After the cadres of the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine went to work in the underground offices, in addition to strengthening leadership in daily production, they also mobilized the masses to use the "three-in-one combination" method to sweep away old problems in a concentrated way. As a result, more than 20 old problems that had existed for one or two years, such as the trolley running bow, the coal car not being filled, and the drilling and blasting not keeping up with the mining, were solved one by one in just over ten days. The workers happily said, "The leaders working in the underground offices really solve problems. Problems that have not been solved for several years and have grown beards have been solved in a few days!"
    After the implementation of the underground office system, cadres have a more specific and detailed understanding of the ideological situation of the masses, political and ideological work has become more in-depth, and it is further closely integrated with production activities, effectively promoting production. The No. 102 flat plate of the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine adopted the "one line, multiple picks" loading method. In the past, there were often phenomena of uneven busy and idle electric picks and downtime. Although the leadership also attached importance to this issue, it was not resolved for a long time. After the leading cadres moved to work in the underground offices this time, they found that the electric pick drivers focused more on completing their own tasks and did not do enough to create conditions for others. Therefore, they strengthened ideological education to make the electric pick drivers further establish an overall concept and actively create conditions for each other. As a result, the utilization rate of electric picks was greatly improved. In the past, the cadres of various units worked in above-ground offices, and the party's calls, instructions, and requirements were all adopted by passing down through layers, and could not be quickly implemented among the masses. Now that leaders at all levels work in the underground offices, the party's calls, instructions, and requirements can all be implemented directly to the end, meet with the masses in a timely manner, and quickly become a huge force to promote production.
    Cadres going to work in the underground offices have also further discovered and solved some problems in the lives of workers. After Bai Zhongxian, the deputy mine manager of the Pingan Mine, went to work in the underground offices of the No. 5 pit, he heard workers say that it was very inconvenient to go to a distant place to take a bath every day after being lifted from the pit. Bai Zhongxian immediately assigned a special person to repair the boiler above the pit entrance that day, so that workers could take a hot bath at the pit entrance after get off work. Some mines have also added labor protection supplies, boiling water supply stations, commodity consignment stores, underground barbershops, etc. on site, which have also facilitated the masses and boosted the enthusiasm of the workers.

    把深入第一线的领导方法制度化要
    阜新煤矿普遍推行井下办公制
    政治工作更加深入　生产关键接连突破　全矿区捷报频传
    据辽宁日报消息　阜新煤矿迅速普遍推行井下办公制度。仅仅十几天的时间，全矿区就建立起一百三十四座井（坑）下办公室，一千一百多名坑段长以上的领导干部搬到井（坑）下办公，使深入第一线的领导方法经常化、制度化，大大鼓舞了群众的干劲，煤炭生产出现一派蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。
    今年5月，阜新海州露天矿八坑的领导干部，由原来在井上办公搬到井下办公，领导作风这一改进促使生产大大提高，6月份的煤炭产量比过去提高20％以上，超额完成了国家计划。中共阜新市委发现这一经验以后，认为井下办公制度是适应煤炭生产特点、改进领导落后于生产实际的有效方法，是领导参加生产领导生产的新发展，要求全市工矿企业特别是各个煤矿认真学习，迅速推广。市委的号召得到了煤矿广大干部的热烈响应，他们连夜行动，纷纷在井下设立办公室，在生产第一线安营扎寨。海州露天矿不到三天，就在露天坑下的平盘上，修起了草棚、席棚、木板的坑下办公室三十二座，从党委书记、矿长、坑长、段长到工程技术人员、科室干部和党群干部等五百多人，整套搬到坑下办公。平安矿、新丘矿和清河门矿，也掀起了办公室大搬家的热潮，各级领导干部层层深入，都由原来在井上搬到井下的巷道、采区和作业场附近办公。井下办公制度迅速在全矿推广。
    井下办公制度实行不久，立即收到了显著的效果，改变了原来在井上多靠开会听汇报、用电话指挥生产的领导方法。代之而行的是经常深入生产实际，到掌子头上、电镐旁边研究分析生产情况，就地指挥生产，就地发现问题，就地运用“三结合”的方法解决，因而问题处理得又快又好，许多生产关键接连突破，新的生产捷报不断传来。平安矿八坑的采煤工人，过去由于班与班之间配合得不够紧密，每次交接班都发生生产中断，有时停产达二三个小时。坑党总支书记史连发下井办公的第三天，就注意了这个问题。他一方面对各班工人加强思想教育，一方面领导大家制订出“一条龙”的交接班制度，实行按工种对口交接的办法。各班工人都主动配合，消灭了因交接班而停产的现象，煤炭产量逐日上升。海州露天矿的干部到井下办公以后，除对日常生产加强领导外，还发动群众，运用“三结合”的方法，突击扫荡老问题，结果在十几天内，就使存在一两年的电车跑弓子、煤车装不满、穿爆跟不上采掘等二十多个老问题一一解决，工人高兴地说：“领导下井办公真解决问题，几年没解决的长了胡子的问题，几天就解决了！”
    推行井下办公制度以后，干部对群众的思想情况了解更具体、更细致，政治思想工作更深入了，同生产活动进一步紧密相结合，有力地推动了生产。海州露天矿一零二平盘采用“一线多镐”的装车方法，过去经常发生电镐忙闲不均、窝工现象，虽然领导方面也重视这一问题，但较长时间没有解决。这次领导干部搬到井下办公以后，发现电镐司机多顾自己完成任务，为别人创造条件不够。于是加强了思想教育，使电镐司机进一步树立整体观念，彼此主动创造条件，结果电镐运用率大大提高。过去各单位的干部在井上办公，对党的号召、指示和要求，都是采取层层下达的办法，不能很快贯彻到群众中去。现在各级领导在井下办公，党的号召、指示和要求都能一竿子插到底，及时和群众见面，迅速成为推动生产的巨大力量。
    干部到井下办公，也进一步发现和解决了工人生活中的一些问题。平安矿副矿长白忠贤到五坑井下办公以后，听工人说，每天升井要到很远的地方去洗澡，很不方便，白忠贤当天就指定专人把坑口上面的锅炉修好，工人下班就能在井口洗上热水澡。有的矿还在现场增设了劳动保护用品、开水供应站、商品代销店、坑下理发室等等，也都方便了群众，鼓舞了工人的干劲。（附图片）
