Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 8th: The First Latin American Youth Congress concluded this afternoon in an atmosphere of unity, brotherly warmth, and fervent support for the Cuban people's struggle against US imperialism.

Amidst thunderous applause, the representatives of all participating Latin American countries unanimously decided to support the recent measures of the Cuban government to nationalize American enterprises. The congress also unanimously decided to hold demonstrations in support of Cuba throughout Latin America on the day the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas convenes in Costa Rica.

The congress passed a general resolution on "Youth and the Modern World." The resolution pointed out, "Latin American youth, in each of our countries, are suffering under the oppression of imperialism, especially the exploitation and plunder of US imperialism, which has caused the deformed development of our countries' economies and the looting of huge profits from the fruits of our labor, thus leaving the Latin American people living in poverty, illiteracy, backwardness, and without prospects for development." The resolution went on to say, "When the people of any country—such as the Cuban people today—want to freely decide their own destiny, then economic blockade and the threat of direct or indirect military aggression fall upon them."

The resolution condemned the military pacts used to enslave and aggress against Latin American countries, such as the Rio de Janeiro Pact, the South Atlantic Treaty, and the bilateral military agreements signed between the United States and Latin American countries, which bind Latin American countries to warlike and Cold War policies. The resolution also condemned the open and secret military bases and rocket launch sites built by the United States in Fernando de Noronha Island in Brazil, Guantanamo in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Ezeiza in Argentina, and elsewhere, believing that these bases undermine the national sovereignty of the countries and regions in which they are located and subject these countries to the threat of atomic war. The resolution also called for a ban on nuclear weapons testing and for the struggle for complete national self-determination.

This resolution stated that the congress sympathizes with and supports the youth of Asian and African countries that have just freed themselves from colonial enslavement or are struggling for complete independence, supports the Algerian people, supports the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan, demands the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, supports the struggle of the youth and people of the newly born Republic of the Congo against armed intervention in the Congo, congratulates the youth and people of Japan, Turkey, and South Korea on their victories in the struggle against imperialism and for democracy and liberation, and protests the racial discrimination and apartheid carried out in some countries, especially in South Africa.

The congress also unanimously decided to support the Cuban Revolution and to conduct fundraising in Latin American countries to donate a tractor for each sugar mill recently nationalized by the Cuban government.

When Zhang Chao, head of the Chinese youth delegation, announced that the Chinese youth were donating a tractor to the Cuban youth, the venue erupted in a storm of applause and shouts of "Long live the People's Republic of China!"

As the congress closed amidst the singing of revolutionary songs, enthusiastic dancing, and shouts of "Down with US imperialism!" and "Cuba yes, Yankees no!", everyone solemnly vowed: We will definitely defend the Cuban Revolution, and we will do so under any circumstances.

The representatives left the venue and took to the streets for demonstrations.

    拉丁美洲青年代表大会通过总决议
    支持古巴人民反对美国侵略
    我国青年代表团宣布赠给古巴青年一台拖拉机
    据新华社哈瓦那8日电　拉丁美洲青年第一次代表大会今天下午在团结、兄弟般的热情和坚决支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义斗争的热烈气氛中闭幕。
    所有参加大会的拉丁美洲国家的代表在热烈的欢呼声中一致决定支持最近古巴政府把美国企业收归国有的措施。大会还一致决定在美洲外长会议在哥斯达黎加开会的那一天，在全拉丁美洲举行支持古巴的示威游行。
    代表大会通过了关于“青年和现代世界”的总决议。决议指出，“拉丁美洲青年在我们的每一个国家中，遭受着帝国主义的压迫，特别是美帝国主义的剥削和掠夺，这就造成了我们这些国家的经济的畸形发展和从我们的劳动果实中掠夺巨额利润的情况，从而使拉丁美洲人民生活在贫困、无文化和落后以及没有发展前景的状况中。”决议接着说，“当任何一个国家的人民——例如今天的古巴人民——要想自由地决定自己命运的时候，那末经济封锁以及直接或间接的军事侵略的威胁就落到他们头上。”
    决议谴责用来对拉丁美洲国家进行奴役和侵略的军事公约，例如里约热内卢公约、南大西洋公约以及美国同拉丁美洲国家签订的双边军事协定，这些协定把拉丁美洲国家束缚在好战的和冷战的政策上。决议还谴责美国在巴西斐南多诺隆耶岛、古巴关塔那摩、波多黎各、阿根廷埃塞伊萨和其他地方所修建的公开的和秘密的军事基地和火箭发射台，认为这些基地损害了所在国家和地区的民族主权，并且使这些国家遭受到原子战争的威胁。决议还要求禁止核武器试验以及争取完全的人民自决权。
    这项决议说，代表大会同情和支持刚刚摆脱殖民奴役或正在为争取完全独立而斗争的亚洲和非洲国家的青年，支持阿尔及利亚人民，支持中国人民为解放台湾而进行的斗争，要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位；支持新生的刚果共和国的青年和人民进行的反对对刚果进行武装干涉的斗争；对日本、土耳其和南朝鲜青年和人民在反帝、争取民主和解放的斗争中取得的胜利表示祝贺，并且抗议在某些国家、特别是在南非所进行的种族歧视和种族隔离。
    代表大会还一致决定支持古巴革命，并且决定在拉丁美洲国家进行募捐，以便为最近古巴政府收归国有的每个糖厂捐献一台拖拉机。
    当中国青年代表团团长张超宣布中国青年赠给古巴青年一台拖拉机的时候，会场响起了暴风雨般的掌声和“中华人民共和国万岁”的欢呼声。
    当代表大会在高唱革命歌曲、热情的跳舞和高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“要古巴不要美国佬！”的口号声中闭幕的时候，大家一致庄严地宣誓：我们一定保卫古巴革命，在任何情况下我们都要这样作。
    代表们离开了会场，走向大街，举行示威游行。
