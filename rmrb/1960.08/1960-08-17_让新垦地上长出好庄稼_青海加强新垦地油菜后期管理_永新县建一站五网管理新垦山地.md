Xinhua News Agency, Xining – Spring rapeseed planted on newly reclaimed land in Qinghai Province is flourishing with abundant branches and blossoms, a sea of yellow. People's commune members, state farm workers, and cadres are strengthening late-stage field management, striving for every blossom to form pods and every seed to be full.

This year, Qinghai utilized large areas of newly reclaimed land to plant spring rapeseed, expanding the spring rapeseed area in agricultural regions and allowing many pastoral areas that had never grown rapeseed before to plant it for the first time. The province's spring rapeseed planting area has expanded by about half compared to last year.

In Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province's largest oilseed production base, high-yield demonstration plots are scattered across the vast land from the southern foothills of the Qilian Mountains to the northern shore of Qinghai Lake. Directors of the high-yield plot management committees of each commune and farm, high-yield plot leaders, management professional groups, and members of agricultural science and technology research groups are responsible at each level. Together with the Tibetan, Han, Hui, and Mongolian people, they are focusing on weeding, topdressing, and watering within the plots, based on the characteristics of newly reclaimed land, such as abundant weeds, rich in nitrogen, deficient in phosphorus and potassium, and relatively dry soil. They then promote these experiences to the larger fields, encouraging various management measures in the large fields to emulate the high-yield plots. Spring rapeseed planted on newly reclaimed land throughout the prefecture has generally been weeded once, some twice or three times, and has been universally topdressed with wild ash and household manure rich in phosphorus and potassium. The vast majority has been watered once, and the level of meticulous management is greatly improved compared to previous years. Members of communes, state farm workers, and cadres in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, while firmly grasping weeding and topdressing, have also prepared smoke piles and dug flood prevention ditches to prevent sudden changes in the plateau climate in August and September, as well as disasters such as early frost and rainstorms. This year, the broad masses of herdsmen in Tianhe County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, planted spring rapeseed for the first time on reclaimed land at the foot of the Bayan Har Mountains. With the help of Han cadres, they learned management techniques—weeding, topdressing, preventing rodents, and preventing frost—so the spring rapeseed is growing more and more vigorously, with abundant flowers and pods.

Since spring rapeseed entered the late-stage management phase, Party committees at all levels in the production areas have transferred a large number of cadres to strengthen leadership on the front lines of production. In Qilian County, at the foot of the Qilian Mountains, from the county Party committee to the Party organizations in each commune, production team, farm, and branch farm, a secretary is in charge, leading the masses, organizing specialized teams for frost prevention, hail prevention, and flood prevention, preparing to respond to possible natural disasters at any time, and ensuring a bumper harvest of spring rapeseed.

People's Daily, Nanchang, August 16 – Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, is implementing "One Station, Five Networks" to comprehensively manage 180,000 mu of miscellaneous grains, oilseeds, melons, and other crops planted on newly reclaimed mountain land. Currently, the vines of pumpkins and sweet potatoes on the newly reclaimed cultivated land are densely covering the ground, and peanuts and beans have begun to blossom and bear fruit.

"One Station, Five Networks" means that in the process of managing newly reclaimed mountain land, a mountain-top command station and specialized management network, technical guidance network, flood and drought prevention network, fertilizer base network, and mountain road network are gradually formed on the newly reclaimed mountain land. In this county, the establishment of "One Station, Five Networks" has greatly improved the management level of newly reclaimed mountain land.

Under the guidance of the principle of "planting more, yielding more, and harvesting more," Yongxin County launched a vigorous movement this spring to march towards barren mountains and hills, planting 180,000 mu of various crops such as sweet potatoes, corn, beans, peanuts, and pumpkins on newly reclaimed red soil, equivalent to 35% of the county's original cultivated land area. "One Station, Five Networks" has greatly promoted field management of newly reclaimed cultivated land. The establishment of mountain-top command stations has rapidly changed the situation where cadres visited newly reclaimed mountain land less frequently due to its distance from the village, and leadership could not keep up, enabling leadership work to achieve "three quicks": problems are discovered quickly, solutions are devised quickly, and experiences are promoted quickly. In ?jiang Commune of this county, 350 mu of pumpkin fields suffered from severe seedling shortages after sowing. Initially, it was generally believed that the seeds were moldy, so a passive approach of replanting missing seedlings was adopted. However, after planting three or four times, the seedling shortage remained at 50%. Since the establishment of the mountain-top command station, commune and team cadres and members have protected the seedlings day and night, carefully observing, and only then discovered the main reason for the seedling shortage. Measures were taken to replant and prevent bird and animal damage simultaneously, ensuring full seedling emergence for the pumpkins.

Here, there are some contradictions in the use of labor between mature land and newly reclaimed land. The establishment of a specialized management network fundamentally resolved this contradiction. Before the establishment of a specialized management team for newly reclaimed mountain land in Buqian Commune, over 1,000 mu of intercropped corn and pumpkin fields on newly reclaimed cultivated land needed replanting. However, labor could not be spared from the fields for a while. Although more than 800 laborers were mobilized for a concentrated effort for four or five days after five or six days, the quality was not good enough, and there were still missing seedlings after replanting. Since 200 people were transferred to establish eleven specialized management teams, they combined weeding and topdressing with replanting, quickly eliminating the missing seedling phenomenon on these thousand acres of land.

The formation of the technical guidance network, flood and drought prevention network, fertilizer base network, and mountain road network has also played a good role in managing newly reclaimed wasteland. For example, there is a lack of experience in managing newly reclaimed mountain land, but with the technical guidance network composed of cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers, some new experiences have been discovered, and some mass experiences have also been improved and promoted in a timely manner. To manage large areas of crops on newly reclaimed mountain land well, sufficient fertilizer is necessary. Thanks to the fertilizer base network formed by livestock farms, earth kilns, and fertilizer storage sheds built on the mountains, the fertilizer application problem for these large areas of newly cultivated land has been solved.

    让新垦地上长出好庄稼
    青海加强新垦地油菜后期管理　永新县建一站五网管理新垦山地
    据新华社西宁讯　青海省新垦地上种植的春油菜枝茂花开，一片黄。人民公社社员、国营农场职工、机关干部们正加强后期田间管理，力争花花结荚，子粒饱满。
    青海今年利用新垦的大片土地种植春油菜，既扩大了农业区春油菜面积，也使以往没有种过油菜的很多牧区草原，第一次种上了春油菜。全省春油菜播种面积比去年扩大一半左右。
    在青海省最大的油料生产基地海北藏族自治州，从祁连山南麓到青海湖北岸的辽阔土地上，油料丰产方星罗棋布。各公社、农场丰产方管理委员会主任、丰产方方长、管理专业组与农业科学技术研究小组成员，层层负责，和藏、汉、回、蒙古各族群众一道，根据新垦地杂草多，含氮丰富，缺磷、钾，土壤较干燥等特点，先在方内做好除草、追肥、浇水等工作，取得经验，再向大田推广，促进大田的各项管理措施向丰产方看齐。全州在新垦地上播种的春油菜已普遍除草一遍，有的除草两遍或三遍，普遍追施了含磷、钾较多的野灰和家粪，绝大部分浇了一次水，精细管理的程度比往年大大提高。海南藏族自治州各公社社员、国营农场职工和机关干部，在狠抓除草、追肥的同时，还准备了熏烟堆、挖好了防洪沟等，预防8、9月高原气候突变，以及发生早霜和暴雨等灾害。玉树藏族自治州天河县广大牧民今年第一次在巴颜喀喇山下开荒播种了春油菜，在汉族干部的帮助下学会了管理技术——除草、追肥、防鼠、防冻等工作，因而春油菜越长越旺盛，花繁荚多。
    在春油菜进入后期管理以来，产区各级党委都抽调大批干部加强了生产第一线的领导。在祁连山下的祁连县，由县委到各公社、生产队、农场、分场的党组织，都有一位书记挂帅，领导群众，组织防霜冻、防冰雹、防洪水等专业队，准备随时迎战可能发生的自然灾害，确保春油菜丰收。
    本报南昌16日电　江西省永新县推行“一站五网”，全面管好了在新垦山地上种植的十八万亩杂粮、油料、瓜类等作物。目前新垦耕地上的南瓜、甘薯的藤蔓密布地面，花生豆类，已开花结实。
    “一站五网”，就是在管好新垦山地的过程中，在新垦山地上逐步形成的山头指挥站和专业管理网、技术指导网、防洪防旱网、肥料基地网、盘山道路网。这个县由于在新垦山地建立了“一站五网”大大提高了新垦山地的管理水平。
    在“多种高产多收”的方针指导下，永新县今春展开了轰轰烈烈的向荒山、丘陵进军的运动，在新垦的红壤土上种植了红薯、玉米、豆类、花生、南瓜等各种作物十八万亩，等于全县原有耕地面积的35％。“一站五网”大大促进了新垦耕地的田间管理工作。由于山头指挥站的建立，迅速改变了因新垦山地离村远，干部去得少，领导跟不上的状况，使领导工作做到“三快”：问题发现快，办法想得快，经验推广快。这个县的?江公社有三百五十亩南瓜地播后大量缺苗，开始时总认为是种籽霉烂，因此采取了缺苗补种的消极办法，但是种了三、四次还是缺苗50％。自从设立山头指挥站以后，社、队干部和社员一道，日夜护苗，精心观察，才发现缺苗的主要原因，采取了补种和防治鸟兽为害同时进行的办法，保证了南瓜的全苗。
    这里，熟地和新垦地在使用劳力上有若干矛盾，建立了专业管理网，这个矛盾就从根本上解决了。埠前公社在建立新垦山地专业管理队以前，有一次，新垦耕地上的一千多亩玉米、南瓜间作地需要补苗，但田间一时又抽不出劳动力，五、六天以后，虽然抽来了八百多劳力突击了四、五天，但是质量又不够好，补苗以后仍有缺苗现象。自从抽调二百多人建立了十一个专业管理队后，他们利用锄草、追肥结合补苗，很快就消灭了这一千多亩地上的缺蔸现象。
    技术指导网、防洪防旱网、肥料基地网和盘山道路网的形成，对管好新垦荒地都分别起了很好的作用。例如，这里缺乏管好新垦山地的经验，但是有了由干部、技术员、老农组成的技术指导网，一些新的经验被摸到了，一些群众的经验也得到及时提高推广。要管好大片新垦山地的作物，必须有充足的肥料。由于有了建在山上的畜牧场、火土窑、储肥棚形成的肥料基地网，这些大面积的新耕地的施肥问题就解决了。
