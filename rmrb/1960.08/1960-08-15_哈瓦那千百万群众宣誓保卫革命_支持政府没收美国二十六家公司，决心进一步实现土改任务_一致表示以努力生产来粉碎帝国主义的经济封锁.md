    Havana Millions Swear to Defend the Revolution
    Support the Government's Confiscation of Twenty-Six American Companies, Determined to Further Implement Land Reform Tasks
    Unanimously Express Determination to Crush Imperialist Economic Blockade Through Hard Work
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 13th – The people of the Cuban capital held a rally in front of the Presidential Palace tonight to support the government's nationalization of twenty-six American companies and to swear to defend the revolution. Tens of thousands of people raised their hands and solemnly swore: "To defend the revolution by all means possible with our strength, our sacrifices, our blood, and our lives."

    A huge Cuban flag hung on the Presidential Palace. In the square in front of the Presidential Palace, countless Cuban flags and flags of Latin American countries rolled like an ocean. From the Presidential Palace all the way to Fraternity Park, enthusiastic crowds waved white handkerchiefs and constantly shouted slogans such as "Cuba yes, Yankees no!" and "Down with U.S. imperialism!"

    The oath was read by a representative of the Cuban Workers' Confederation. Workers, peasants, militia, students, and ordinary residents participating in the rally shouted in unison: "We workers and peasants swear to unite further and more strongly to fulfill the task of land reform!" "We swear to join the worker-peasant militia and to be prepared to resolutely, stubbornly, and bravely oppose any aggressor, anyone engaged in conspiracies or rebellions against the revolution and the revolutionary government, saboteurs, imperialist and counter-revolutionary propagandists; to subdue them with our counterattacks and hand them over to the revolutionary authorities." "We swear to crush the imperialist schemes and the judgments made by the Organization of American States in the name of the deceitful Pan-American system and the hypocritical continental mutual assistance." "We swear to thank all the people who have helped us defend Cuba and the revolution, such as the people of Latin America, the people of Asian and African countries, as well as the people of the Soviet Union, China, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and other socialist countries."

    The oath also expressed the determination to crush the imperialist economic blockade through hard work, firmly support and defend the revolutionary government led by Castro, strengthen the unity of trade unions at all levels, and support the people and workers of Latin America and the world.

    The masses at the meeting finally swore: "We firmly support the slogans 'Cuba yes, Yankees no' and 'Rather die than lose the motherland,' confident that we will win."

    During the oath-taking, people waved their national flags excitedly, and at the end of the oath-taking, the Cuban national anthem was solemnly played.

    President Dorticós stated in his speech that Cuba's revolution will never retreat. He said, "Tonight, the people have sworn here to defend their revolution and defend their motherland." Dorticós emphasized that the resolutions to be passed by the Organization of American States foreign ministers' meeting "are of no importance; Cuba has held a meeting of the people." He said, "The people have paid a lot of blood to win the right to control their own destiny. The revolution will never retreat."
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana - The Executive Committee of the Cuban Workers' Confederation issued a statement condemning the intensifying U.S. conspiracy of aggression against Cuba.
    The Cuban Workers' Confederation expressed in its statement its strongest and most angry protest against the insulting note presented to the Cuban government by the U.S. ambassador on the 8th regarding the nationalization of American enterprises by Cuba. The statement called on workers and the people of the whole country to consolidate and strengthen their internal unity to cope with foreign threats of aggression against Cuba. The statement called for increasing production and improving labor productivity in nationalized enterprises, enhancing revolutionary vigilance and strengthening the work of the worker-peasant militia, and defending the lives of the Cuban people and the achievements of the revolution at all costs.

    新华社哈瓦那13日电　古巴首都人民今天晚上在这里的议会大厦前面举行了支持政府把美国二十六家公司收归国有和保卫革命的宣誓大会。成千上万的人举着手庄严地宣誓：“以我们的力量、我们的牺牲、我们的鲜血和我们的生命千方百计地保卫革命。”
    在议会大厦上，悬挂着一幅巨大的古巴国旗。议会大厦前面的广场上无数的古巴国旗和拉丁美洲国家的国旗像海洋一样地在滚动。从议会大厦一直到友爱公园，热情的群众挥着白手绢不断地高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬”和“打倒美帝国主义！”的口号。
    宣誓书是由古巴工人联合会的代表宣读的。参加大会的工人、农民、民兵、学生和普通居民一起跟着高呼：“我们工人和农民宣誓，进一步更加坚强地团结起来实现土地改革的任务！”“我们宣誓参加工人和农民民兵，并且准备坚决顽强和英勇无畏地反对任何侵略者，反对任何进行反对革命和革命政府的阴谋活动或叛乱的人，反对破坏者、帝国主义和反革命的宣传者；靠我们的反击压服他们并把他们交给革命当局。”“我们宣誓粉碎帝国主义的阴谋诡计以及美洲国家组织以骗人的泛美体系和虚伪的大陆上的相互支援的名义所做出的判决。”“我们宣誓：感谢所有帮助我们保卫古巴和革命的人民，如像拉丁美洲的人民、亚非国家的人民，以及苏联、中国、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国和其它社会主义国家的人民”。
    宣誓书还表示要以努力生产来粉碎帝国主义的经济封锁，坚决支持和保卫卡斯特罗领导的革命政府，加强各级工会的团结，并且支持拉丁美洲和全世界的人民和工人。
    与会群众最后宣誓：“我们坚定地拥护‘要古巴，不要美国佬’和‘没有祖国毋宁死’的口号，确信我们必胜。”
    在宣誓的时候，人们激动地挥动着国旗，宣誓结束时庄严地奏起了古巴国歌。
    多尔蒂科斯总统在会上的讲话中表示，古巴的革命决不后退。他说，“今天晚上，人民已经在这里宣誓保卫他们的革命和保卫他们的祖国”。多尔蒂科斯强调指出，美洲国家组织外长会议将要通过的决议“无关重要，古巴已经举行了人民的会议”。他说，“人民付出了大量的鲜血才赢得了掌握自己命运的权利。革命决不会后退”。
    据新华社哈瓦那讯　古巴工人联合会执行委员会发表声明，谴责美国正在加紧进行的对古巴的侵略阴谋。
    古巴工人联合会在声明中对美国大使8日就美国企业被古巴收归国有而向古巴政府提出的侮辱性的照会表示它最强烈和最愤怒的抗议。声明号召工人和全国人民巩固和加强他们的内部团结，以应付外国对古巴的侵略威胁。声明要求在国有化的企业中增加生产和提高劳动生产率，提高革命警惕性和加强工人民兵的工作，不惜任何代价地保卫古巴人民的生命和革命的成果。
