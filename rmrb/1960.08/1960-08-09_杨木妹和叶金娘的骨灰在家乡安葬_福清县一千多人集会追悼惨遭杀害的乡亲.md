Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 8th: The ashes of overseas Chinese women Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang, who were brutally murdered by the West Java military authorities in Indonesia on July 3rd, were escorted by their husbands and children and arrived in their hometown, Yuxi Township, Fuqing County, Fujian Province, on the 7th to be placed in the shrine.

Before the enshrining ceremony on the morning of the 7th, more than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Fuqing County solemnly held a memorial meeting in Yuxi Township to mourn the fellow villagers who were brutally murdered. Huge portraits of Ye Jinniang and Yang Mumei were hung in the venue. In front of the altar, where the ashes and blood-stained clothes of the deceased were placed, were wreaths presented by all walks of life in Fuqing County and Yuxi Township. On both sides of the portraits were elegiac couplets sent by overseas Chinese organizations in Jakarta, Surabaya, and other places.

The memorial meeting began with a eulogy delivered by Chen Chunyan, the head of Fuqing County. He expressed his condolences to the two deceased fellow villagers on behalf of the Fuqing County People's Committee and the people of the county, extended his cordial condolences to their families, and once again strongly protested the atrocities of the West Java military authorities, under the instigation of powerful groups in Indonesia, for murdering overseas Chinese.

Then, representatives of the relatives of Yang Mumei and Ye Jinniang tearfully denounced the crimes of the West Java military authorities in creating the bloody case. Lin Yurong, Ye Jinniang's younger sister-in-law, who witnessed the tragedy, held up the blood-stained clothes and said sadly: "This is the ironclad proof of the West Java soldiers' murder. My sister-in-law Ye Jinniang was wearing this dress when she was shot seven times and died. After the West Java soldiers wounded my sister-in-law, they pointed their guns at the overseas Chinese present, preventing them from rescuing her, which ultimately led to her death."

Lin Yuqing, the eldest daughter of Yang Mumei, tearfully denounced at the meeting: "My mother has been in Indonesia for more than 20 years, always abiding by the law and living in harmony with the Indonesian people. As a result, she was shot and killed innocently by the West Java soldiers, resulting in a tragic case of one person dying with two lives. She left me and seven younger siblings, the youngest of whom is only one year and three months old, and cries every night, calling for her mother incessantly."

Lin Bingwang, the second son of Ye Jinniang, on behalf of all the families of the deceased, expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the deep concern of the motherland's government and people, and expressed that he must study hard, work actively, and contribute to the cause of socialist construction.

After the memorial meeting, the ashes of the two deceased were sent to their hometown, Wugang Village, to be placed in the shrine.

    杨木妹和叶金娘的骨灰在家乡安葬
    福清县一千多人集会追悼惨遭杀害的乡亲
    据新华社福州8日电　7月3日惨遭印度尼西亚西爪哇军事当局杀害的华侨妇女杨木妹、叶金娘的骨灰，在她们的丈夫和儿女护送下，于7日运到她们的家乡——福建省福清县渔溪乡安龛。
    7日上午，在安龛仪式举行以前，福清县各界人民一千多人在渔溪乡隆重举行追悼大会，沉痛哀悼惨遭杀害的乡亲。会场上悬挂着叶金娘、杨木妹的巨幅遗像，安放着死难者的骨灰和血衣的灵台前面，放满了福清县和渔溪乡各界敬献的花圈。遗像两侧悬挂着雅加达、泗水等地华侨团体送的挽联。
    追悼会首先由福清县县长陈春炎致悼词。他代表福清县人民委员会和全县人民向两位死难乡亲表示哀悼，向她们的家属致亲切的慰问，并对西爪哇军事当局在印度尼西亚有势力集团指使下杀害华侨的暴行再一次提出强烈抗议。
    接着杨木妹、叶金娘亲属代表在会上悲愤控诉西爪哇军事当局制造血案的罪行。目睹惨案发生经过的叶金娘的小姑林玉蓉拿着血迹斑斑的血衣悲痛地说：“这就是西爪哇军人杀人的铁证。我嫂嫂叶金娘就是穿着这件衣服，身中七弹后死去的。西爪哇军人在打伤我嫂嫂后还端着枪威逼在场的侨胞不得前去抢救，终于使我嫂嫂不治身死。”
    杨木妹的长女林玉清在会上沉痛地控诉说：“我母亲在印度尼西亚二十多年，一向安分守己，和印度尼西亚人民友好相处。结果，被西爪哇军人无辜开枪打死，造成一人两命的惨案。留下我和七个弟妹，最小的才一岁零三个月，每晚都是哭个不停地喊着要妈妈。”
    叶金娘的次子林秉望代表全体死难者的家属，对祖国政府和人民的深切关怀，表示衷心感谢，并表示一定要努力学习，积极工作，为社会主义建设事业贡献力量。
    在追悼会结束后，两位死者的骨灰被送到她们的故乡梧岗村安龛。
