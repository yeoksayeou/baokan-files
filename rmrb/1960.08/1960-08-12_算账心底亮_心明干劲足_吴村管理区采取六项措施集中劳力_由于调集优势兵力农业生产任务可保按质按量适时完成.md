    Accounting Brightens Hearts, Clear Minds Boost Enthusiasm
    Wucun Management District Adopts Six Measures to Concentrate Labor Force
    Mobilizing Superior Forces Ensures Agricultural Production Tasks are Completed on Time, with Guaranteed Quality and Quantity

    (Our report) Recently, the Wucun Management District of Qingxu County, Shanxi Province, conducted two accounts: a labor account and a planting area account. Through accounting, the management district was able to promptly concentrate labor on the front line, strengthening current field management of autumn crops.

    Since the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee emphasized agriculture as the foundation, and specifically proposed that the labor force participating in the agricultural front line must account for more than 80% of the total rural labor force, the Wucun Management District, like other management districts, enthusiastically and actively implemented this policy. However, had the labor force participating in the agricultural production front line reached 80%? Was there still potential to be tapped? Not only were the broad masses of commune members unsure about these questions, but even the main cadres of the management district were also uncertain, simply believing that there was already a lot of labor in agriculture. After discovering this situation, the commune Party committee and the county Party committee working group believed that this was a kind of blind optimism, and the existence of this emotion was greatly detrimental to further tapping labor in the future. Therefore, with the help of the commune Party committee and the county Party committee working group, they began to take stock.

    The result of the labor accounting was as follows: the entire management district had 744 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women. Before concentrating the labor force (before June), the labor force invested in the agricultural front line was 492 people, accounting for only 66% of the total rural labor force, while industry, sideline occupations, and logistics (canteens, nurseries, sewing factories) occupied 252 laborers, accounting for 34% of the rural labor force. After concentrating the labor force, the labor force participating in the agricultural front line would increase to 556 people, accounting for 74.7% of the rural labor force, an increase of 8.7% compared to before. But this was only a plan. In reality, the number of laborers compressed from industry, sideline occupations, and logistics was far from this large. It was discovered from accounting that 33 laborers drawn from canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, maternity hospitals, sewing factories, and other departments had already returned to their original units. In the accounting process, everyone also specifically calculated the labor input required by the entire district in the first half of August. If no further efforts were made to tap the labor force, the entire district would be short at least more than 2,000 workdays.

    Through accounting, cadres further realized the significance of concentrating labor to strengthen agricultural production. Pan Hongyuan, director of the management district, said, "Now is the crucial time. If the labor force doesn't come up, the foundation will be difficult to guarantee, and this year's autumn harvest will be empty talk." Luo Sanhao, deputy secretary of the Party branch, said, "As long as we are clear-headed, have a bright mind, and cadres are determined, the labor force can be drawn down, and the agricultural front can be strengthened. In the previous stage, I was somewhat focused on my own area, just afraid that the work I was responsible for would not be done well, so the labor force in logistics could not be drawn out." On the basis of unified understanding among the cadres, the results of the accounting were announced to the masses to mobilize everyone to offer suggestions, and finally, everyone's opinions were summarized, and six new methods for tapping labor and improving labor efficiency were found:

    (1) Implement comprehensive utilization of labor, both industry and agriculture, farming during busy seasons and industry during slack seasons. According to this principle, the management district's brick factory and some sideline production will be temporarily suspended for one month to fully participate in agricultural production, which can draw out 32 strong laborers;

    (2) Re-examine the implementation of the previous labor plan to ensure the labor force is concentrated;

    (3) Canteens and other logistics departments, on the basis of the previous compression, will now need to take time out each day to participate in field labor;

    (4) Promote the experience of carrying manure to the fields and grass home throughout the district. In this way, 25 laborers can be saved every day for just cutting grass;

    (5) There are 224 students in the district, and they will be organized to participate in certain labor during their vacations;

    (6) Transfer another 20 laborers from county and commune industries and capital construction.

    Through the above methods, 85 strong laborers were actually added to the agricultural front.

    Accounting for planting area also made the cadres and the masses more aware of the great significance of allocating labor to the front line of agricultural production. The total original planting area of the district was 9,876 mu. This year, by reclaiming wasteland and using small plots of land, the planting area was expanded by a total of 128 mu. Due to the construction of pig farms, brick factories, and middle schools, a total of 93 mu of land was occupied. Offsetting the expansion and occupation, the actual expansion was only 35 mu. During accounting, everyone also calculated an account that is easily overlooked, that is: due to the prolonged drought in the first half of the year, the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges in autumn crops was very serious. In addition to the replanting that has already been done in the previous stage, the current missing seedlings are at least equivalent to planting 340 mu of land less. This means that this year's planting area is actually 305 mu less than last year. In order to implement the policy of "planting more and harvesting more", the management committee decided that in addition to replanting all the missing seedling land with vegetables, all 2,600 mu of wheat fields will also be planted with vegetables on the basis of the previous stage's multiple cropping area. In this way, the district's multiple cropping area will be twice as large as last year. With agricultural work so concentrated, it is necessary to increase labor to complete the task. Everyone realized the seriousness of the problem and decided to take resolute measures to concentrate labor and strengthen the agricultural front. It is estimated that after the implementation of the above-mentioned measures to concentrate labor, this year's agricultural production tasks in this management district can be guaranteed to be completed on time, with guaranteed quality and quantity.

    With a bright mind, and full of enthusiasm, on the first day after the accounting, the labor force participating in agricultural production in the district increased from about 80% before the accounting to more than 97%. On the first day of the fierce battle, the results were brilliant. In addition to a part of the labor force completing wheat harvesting and threshing, a total of 105 mu of rutabaga and mustard greens were urgently planted, 242 mu of vegetable land were leveled, and 3,500 loads of manure were delivered.

    算账心底亮　心明干劲足
    吴村管理区采取六项措施集中劳力
    由于调集优势兵力农业生产任务可保按质按量适时完成
    本报讯　最近，山西清徐县吴村公社吴村管理区算了两笔账：劳力账和播种面积账。通过算账，使这个管理区及时地调集劳力到第一线，加强了当前的秋田管理。
      自从党中央和省委强调以农业为基础，并具体提出参加农业第一线的劳力必须占到农村总劳力80％以上的精神下达以后，吴村管理区也和其他管理区一样，热情积极地贯彻执行了这一方针。但是，参加农业生产第一线的劳力究竟达到80％没有？还有无潜力可挖？这些问题不仅广大社员不摸底，就连管理区的几个主要干部也心中无数，只是认为农业上的劳力已经不少了。公社党委和县委工作组发现这种情况后，认为这是一种盲目乐观情绪，这种情绪的存在，对今后进一步挖掘劳力大大不利。于是，在公社党委和县委工作组的帮助下，就开始算账了。
    劳力账算的结果是这样：全管区共有男女整半劳力七百四十四个，在集中劳动力以前（6月份以前），投入农业第一线的劳力为四百九十二人，只占在农村总劳力的66％，而工业、副业、后勤（食堂、托儿所、缝纫厂）等方面就占用劳力二百五十二个，占到在村劳力的34％；集中劳动力以后，参加农业第一线的劳力将增加到五百五十六人，占在村劳力的74.7％，比以前增加了8.7％。但这只是计划，实际上，从工业、副业、后勤等方面压缩下来的劳力，数字远远没有这么大。从算账当中发现，原来从食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、妇产院、缝纫厂等方面抽调出来的劳力，又有三十三个已经回到原来单位。在算账中，大家也具体算了8月前半月全区所需投工情况，如果不再设法挖掘劳力，全区至少要缺少二千多个工。
    通过算账，使干部们进一步认识了集中劳力加强农业生产的意义。管理区主任潘洪元说：“现在正是要紧时候，劳力要上不去，基础就难保证，今年的秋季丰收就是空谈。”党支部副书记罗三好说：“只要头脑清醒了，心底亮了，干部下决心，劳力就能抽下来，农业战线就能增强。前一阶段我有些本位主义，光怕自己负责的工作搞不好，所以后勤方面的劳力就抽不出来。”在干部认识统一的基础上，又把算账的结果向群众宣布，发动大家献计献策，最后归纳大家的意见，又找出了六条挖掘劳力和提高劳动效率的新办法：
    （1）实行劳力综合利用，亦工亦农，农忙则农，农闲则工。根据这个原则，对管理区的砖厂和一些副业生产要暂时停工一月，全力参加农业生产，共可抽出三十二个强劳力；
    （2）重新复查前段劳力计划的执行情况，保证劳力集中起来；
    （3）食堂等后勤部门，在前段压缩的基础上，今后每人每天要抽出一部分的时间参加田间劳动；
    （4）在全区推广上地捎粪、回家捎草的经验。这样，仅割草一项每天即可节省劳力二十五个；
    （5）全区共有学生二百二十四人，利用放假时间，组织他们参加一定的劳动；
    （6）从县、社工业和基本建设等方面再抽调劳力二十人。
    通过上述办法，实际为农业战线增添强壮劳力八十五人。
    通过算播种面积账，也使干部和群众更清楚了调集劳力到农业生产第一线的重大意义。全区原有播种面积九千八百七十六亩，今年通过开荒和利用小块地共扩大播种面积一百二十八亩；由于修建猪场、砖厂和修建中学，共占用土地九十三亩，扩大和占用相顶，实际只扩大了三十五亩。算账中大家还算了一笔容易被人忽视的账，这就是：由于前半年久旱无雨，秋作物的缺苗断垅现象十分严重，除了前段已经补种的以外，目前的缺苗至少等于少种三百四十亩土地。这就是说，今年的播种面积实际上是比去年减少了三百零五亩。为了贯彻执行“多种多收”的方针，管理委员会决定除了把缺苗地全部补种蔬菜以外，还要把二千六百亩麦田在前段复播面积的基础上，全部种上菜，这样全区复播面积将比去年扩大两倍。在农活如此集中的情况下，必须增加劳力，才能完成任务。大家认识了问题的严重性，决定采取坚决措施集中劳力，加强农业战线。估计上述集中劳力的措施实现后，今年这个管理区的农业生产任务，就可保按质按量适时完成。
    心底亮，干劲足，算账后的第一天，全区参加农业生产的劳动力，由算账前的80％左右增加到97％以上。激战第一天，战果辉煌，除了一部分劳力结束麦收打场以外，共抢种蔓菁、芥菜一百零五亩，整菜地二百四十二亩，送粪三千五百担。
