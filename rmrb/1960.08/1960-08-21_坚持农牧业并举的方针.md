    Adhere to the Policy of Combining Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
    Gong Fuheng, First Secretary of the CPC Hainan Zhou Committee
    Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is located in the central part of Qinghai Province. The Yellow River runs through the center, with more than 700 large and small rivers and 26 large and small lakes. The water resources are quite abundant. It can be said that it is a fertile land with crisscrossing rivers and lakes dotted everywhere. The grasslands here are vast, the terrain is flat, and the water and grass are lush. It is not only the province's main livestock product base, but also rich in mineral resources. In particular, there is a vast expanse of fertile land suitable for planting wheat, highland barley, peas, broad beans, oats, rapeseed, potatoes and other crops, as well as fruit trees, melons, vegetables and other horticultural crops. The prospects for agricultural development are extremely great. However, due to the exploitation and rule of the vast working people by a handful of feudal herdowners, chieftains, and reactionary religious upper strata before liberation, and due to the brutal rule of the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Bufang bandit gangs and the creation of ethnic disputes, the political, economic, and cultural education of all ethnic groups have long been in a backward state, people's lives have been extremely impoverished, suffering from hunger and cold, and living lives worse than cattle and horses.
    After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Hainan area fundamentally ended the history of national oppression, discrimination, and mutual killing due to the implementation of the policy of national equality and unity. Over the past decade, we have carried out a series of reforms in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, established ethnic regional autonomous governments, trained a large number of ethnic minority cadres, and supported poor herdsmen in developing production. Since 1958, under the brilliant light of the General Line and encouraged by the Great Leap Forward situation, the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen have rapidly realized the people's commune system, thoroughly destroying the brutal rule of the feudal herdowner class, thus enabling agricultural and animal husbandry production to step onto a new stage of high-speed development. In 1959, under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in our prefecture also reclaimed a large amount of wasteland and vigorously promoted the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, so that agricultural and animal husbandry production achieved a new victory of continued leap forward. In terms of agricultural production, in this year, the entire autonomous prefecture planted 540,000 mu of various crops, and the cultivated land area increased by more than 100,000 mu compared with the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and the grain output increased by more than 69 million jin. In terms of animal husbandry production, many high-yield and bumper-yield livestock groups emerged last year. According to incomplete statistics, there were 35 groups of sheep with a lamb survival rate of over 100%. In Guoname County, the Zhunhe brigade of Guomaying commune's 1,500 mature ewes gave birth to more than 2,000 lambs in about a year, with a lamb survival rate of over 133%. Among them, one group's lamb survival rate exceeded 188%, becoming a high-yield red flag in Qinghai Province's animal husbandry production.
    Based on the favorable conditions of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, which has a large amount of reclaimable land and great prospects for agricultural development, the Provincial Party Committee has put forward the call to the people of all ethnic groups in Hainan Autonomous Prefecture to "build Hainan into a new granary in three to five years." In order to complete this arduous and glorious task, since last winter, our people of all ethnic groups have been high-spirited and enthusiastic, launching a mass movement to reclaim wasteland and vigorously develop agricultural production from state-owned farms and ranches to communes, from government agencies to factories, and from the army to schools. The production upsurge of "marching towards the wasteland and demanding grain from the land" swept across every corner of the entire autonomous prefecture, and a great situation appeared on the agricultural production front. Thanks to the active efforts of the people of all ethnic groups and all cadres, the entire autonomous prefecture completed this year's sowing task in one go, sowing more than 1.7 million mu of various crops, more than one month ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota, and the sown area was nearly doubled compared with last year. After overfulfilling the sowing task, the broad masses of people and cadres advanced victoriously, investing in field management with the lofty ambition of "not stopping management until the grain is in hand" and a high degree of labor enthusiasm, launching a struggle against drought and building high-yield plots. At present, the crops in the entire autonomous prefecture are generally growing well, and the early-maturing areas along the Yellow River have begun harvesting, presenting a scene of bumper harvest.
    Although the history of agricultural development in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is not long, we have gained some experience from practice. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly instructed us that agriculture is the foundation for developing the national economy. Without the development of agriculture, it would be difficult to develop other construction undertakings. Based on this instruction, since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, Party organizations at all levels in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, while vigorously developing animal husbandry production, have vigorously grasped agriculture and developed agricultural production at high speed. In developing agricultural production, we have adopted a series of "walking on two legs" policies based on the specific situation of the entire autonomous prefecture, such as a large proportion of animal husbandry, a large amount of reclaimable land, a poor agricultural foundation, and extensive cultivation, such as "developing agriculture at high speed and developing animal husbandry simultaneously," "expanding the cultivated land area and increasing the yield per unit area simultaneously," and "taking grain as the key link, vigorously grasping grain, and planting oil crops and other cash crops simultaneously" to achieve an all-round leap forward. Experience has proven that this is correct. Due to the development of agriculture, abundant forage and feed have been provided for animal husbandry, ending the history of single-industry animal husbandry and promoting settled grazing and stable development of animal husbandry. The development of animal husbandry, in turn, has provided high-quality fertilizer and a large number of draught animals for the great development of agriculture. In recent years, the cultivated land area of the entire autonomous prefecture has continued to expand rapidly, and the yield per unit area has also been increasing year by year. In 1959, the yield per mu of grain crops was more than 500 jin, reaching more than 38,000 mu, accounting for 7.16% of the sown area in the same year. At the same time, the output of other cash crops has also increased accordingly.
    The realization of the people's commune system has opened up a broad world for vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously promoting the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry. Developing agricultural production and vigorously promoting the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry are the urgent demands of the people of all ethnic groups in pastoral areas. However, in the past, due to the constraints of the old relations of production on the development of productive forces, the feudal herdowner class slandered wasteland reclamation as "destroying grasslands" and tried every means to obstruct it. In addition, the individual and scattered animal husbandry economy was not transformed, and it was quite difficult to develop agricultural production. After the socialist revolution in pastoral areas and the realization of the people's commune system, the ideological awareness of the people of all ethnic groups has been unprecedentedly raised, creating extremely favorable conditions for the all-round development of agricultural and animal husbandry production. When the State Party Committee put forward the call to herdsmen of all ethnic groups to "reclaim wasteland and cultivate land in every team, and achieve grain self-sufficiency in every commune," it immediately received a warm response and achieved great results. In 1959, more than half of the communes and production teams in the pastoral areas of the entire autonomous prefecture achieved grain self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency. At the same time, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, we also established a large number of state-owned farms, concentrated our efforts on reclaiming wasteland and cultivating land, and vigorously developed agricultural production. At present, 12 state-owned farms have been established in the entire autonomous prefecture, with more than 1.5 million mu of cultivated land. The establishment of these farms has greatly promoted the economic development and prosperity of our prefecture.
    To wage a struggle against various conservative ideas is an important guarantee for the high-speed development of agricultural production. In recent years, we have continuously criticized conservative ideas such as "developing agricultural production in pastoral areas will affect the development of animal husbandry," "herdsmen do not understand agricultural production knowledge and cannot grow crops," and "there is a shortage of labor, and it is difficult to develop agriculture." At the same time, we have led the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen to overcome numerous difficulties and create many favorable conditions for the development of agricultural production. For example, our prefecture is located in a high-altitude and cold region with no absolute frost-free period, and only one crop can be planted a year, and the population is sparse, making the spring plowing and sowing task quite arduous. In order to solve these difficulties, we adopted the method of early sowing. Last winter, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee on preventing drought, resisting drought, and seizing moisture for early sowing, we boldly tried to sow 300,000 mu of winter spring wheat, breaking with convention. This not only changed the farming system, but also adjusted the uneven busy and slack seasons in winter and spring, solving the difficulty of labor and animal power shortage during spring sowing, making the completion of this year's sowing task early, fast, large, good. At present, these 300,000 mu of winter-sown crops are generally growing well, thus breaking the various conservative arguments such as "cannot be winter-sown" and "few people cannot grow many crops," providing an important experience for vigorously developing our agricultural production.
    At present, our prefecture is in a new period of great development and great construction. The rapid development of our prefecture and the socialist construction undertakings in the entire province urgently require us to intensify our work, redouble our efforts, and develop agricultural production at high speed, greatly increasing grain production to meet the requirements of the rapidly developing new situation. To this end, the people of all ethnic groups in the entire autonomous prefecture are determined to advance victoriously, work hard, continuously expand the sown area, and strive to build Hainan into a new granary as soon as possible.
    In order to successfully complete the above tasks, we must do the following tasks well in the future:
    1. Further strengthen the Party's leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, and resolutely implement the policy that agriculture is the foundation for developing the national economy and that agriculture takes grain as the key link. Sowing grain widely, vigorously promoting the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, and vigorously developing agricultural production are the common responsibilities of all departments and industries. All cadres and people of all ethnic groups must actively reclaim wasteland and cultivate land on the one hand, and continuously expand the cultivated land area; on the other hand, continue to resolutely implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production, build high-yield plots on a large scale, and improve the yield per unit area to achieve multiple varieties, high yields, and multiple harvests.
    2. Mobilize the whole Party and the whole people to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture. Run agricultural and animal husbandry machinery manufacturing plants and establish chemical fertilizer bases on a large scale, and give full play to the utilization rate of existing equipment to improve production capacity and provide agriculture with more machinery and high-quality fertilizers, accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization.
    3. In accordance with the "three-main" policy of "small-scale as the main focus, water storage as the main focus, and commune-run as the main focus" and the principle of combining large, medium, and small, launch mass movements on a large scale, and "three waters" (rainwater, river water, and groundwater) should be grasped simultaneously. At the same time, small hydropower stations should be built in accordance with local conditions to move towards agricultural electrification.

    坚持农牧业并举的方针
    中共海南州委第一书记　龚福恒
    海南藏族自治州位于青海省的中部，黄河横贯中央，大小河流七百余条，大小湖泊二十六个，水利资源相当丰富，可说是沃野千里，河流纵横，湖泊星罗棋布。这里草原广大，地势平坦，水草丰美。不但是全省主要的畜产品基地，矿藏资源也十分丰富。特别是境内有广阔肥沃的土地，适宜种植小麦、青稞、豌豆、蚕豆、燕麦、油菜、马铃薯等农作物，以及果树、瓜菜等园艺作物，农业发展前途极大。但是，由于解放前一小撮封建牧主、头人和反动宗教上层对广大劳动人民的压榨和统治，由于蒋介石、马步芳匪帮的残酷统治和制造民族纠纷，致使各民族的政治、经济和文化教育长期处于落后状态，人民生活极端贫困，饥寒交迫，过着牛马不如的生活。
    解放后，海南地区在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，由于实行了民族平等团结的政策，根本结束了民族压迫、歧视和互相残杀的历史。十年来，我们按照党中央和省委的指示，进行了一系列的改革，建立了民族区域自治政权，培养了大批民族干部，扶助贫苦牧民发展生产。1958年以来，广大农牧民在总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，迅速实现了人民公社化，彻底摧毁了封建牧主阶级的残酷统治，从而使农牧业生产跨上了高速度发展的新阶段。1959年，我州各族人民在党的领导下，又大量垦荒造田，大搞农牧结合，使农牧业生产获得了继续跃进的新胜利。在农业生产上，这一年全自治州播种各类作物五十四万亩，耕地面积比大跃进的1958年增加了十万多亩，粮食产量增长了六千九百多万斤；在畜牧业生产方面，去年出现了许多高额丰产畜群。据不完全统计，有三十五群绵羊繁殖成活率超过了100％，贵南县过马营公社直核大队七群的一千五百多只适龄绵母羊，在一年左右的时间内产羔两千多只，繁殖成活率达到133％以上，其中有一群繁殖成活率超过188％，成为青海省畜牧业生产中的一面高产红旗。
    根据海南藏族自治州可垦荒地多、农业发展前途大的有利条件，省委向海南全自治州的各族人民提出了“在三、五年内把海南建设成为新的粮仓”的号召。为了完成这一艰巨而光荣的任务，去冬以来，我们各族人民意气风发，干劲冲天，从国营农牧场到公社，从机关到工厂，从军队到学校，很快地掀起了一个垦荒造田、大力发展农业生产的群众运动。“向荒滩进军，向大地要粮”的生产高潮席卷全自治州的各个角落，农业生产战线上出现了一派大好形势。由于各族人民和全体干部的积极努力，全自治州一鼓作气，仅撒种各种作物一百七十余万亩，比往年提前一个多月超额完成了今年的播种任务，播种面积比去年扩大了近两倍。在超额完成播种任务之后，广大群众和干部又乘胜前进，以“粮食不到手，管理不罢休”的雄心壮志和高度的劳动热情投入了田间管理，展开了抗旱防旱斗争，大建丰产方。目前，全自治州庄稼大都生长良好，黄河沿岸早熟地区已开镰收割，呈现出一片丰收的景象。
    海南藏族自治州农业大发展的历史虽然不长，但我们从实践中已摸索出一些经验。党中央和毛主席一再指示我们，农业是发展国民经济的基础，农业不发展，其他各项建设事业也就难以发展。根据这一指示，自解放以来，特别是1958年大跃进以来，海南藏族自治州各级党组织，在大力发展畜牧业生产的同时，即大抓农业，高速度地发展农业生产。在发展农业生产上，我们根据全自治州畜牧业比重大，可垦荒地多，农业基础差，耕作粗放等具体情况，采取了“高速度发展农业与发展牧业同时并举”、“扩大耕地面积与提高单位面积产量同时并举”、“以粮为纲，大抓粮食与种植油料作物及其它经济作物同时并举”等一系列“两条腿走路”的方针，实现全面跃进。经验证明，这样做是正确的。由于农业的发展，为畜牧业提供了丰富的饲草、饲料，结束了单一经营畜牧业的历史，促进了定居放牧和畜牧业的稳定发展；而畜牧业的发展，反过来又为农业的大发展提供了优质肥料和大量的耕畜。几年来，全自治州的耕地面积不断迅速扩大，单位面积产量也在逐年提高，1959年粮食作物亩产在五百斤以上的即达三万八千多亩，占同年播种面积的7.16％。同时，其它经济作物的产量也有了相应的增长。
    人民公社化的实现，为大力发展农业，大搞农牧结合，开辟了广阔的天地。发展农业生产，大搞农牧结合，这是牧业区各族人民的迫切要求。但是在以前，由于旧的生产关系束缚着生产力的发展，封建牧主阶级污蔑开荒种地是“破坏草原”，百般进行阻挠；加之个体的、分散的畜牧业经济没有改造，要发展农业生产是相当困难的。经过牧区社会主义革命，实现人民公社化后，各族人民的觉悟水平空前高涨，为全面发展农牧业生产创造了极为有利的条件。当州委向各族牧民提出“队队开荒种地，社社实现粮食自给”的号召后，立即得到了热烈的响应，并取得了很大的成绩。1959年全自治州牧业区有一半以上的公社和生产队实现了粮食自给或半自给。与此同时，我们还根据党中央和省委的指示，大量举办国营农场，集中力量垦荒造田，大力发展农业生产。目前全自治州已建立国营农场十二个，拥有耕地一百五十余万亩。这些农场的建立，对我州的经济发展和繁荣起了极大的促进作用。
    和各种保守思想进行斗争，是高速度发展农业生产的重要保证。几年来，我们曾不断批判了“在牧业区发展农业生产会影响畜牧业发展”，“牧民不懂农业生产知识，种不了庄稼”，“劳力少，发展农业有困难”等等保守思想。同时，领导广大农牧民群众，克服了重重困难，给发展农业生产创造了很多有利条件。如我州地处高寒，没有绝对的无霜期，一年只能种植一茬作物，而且人口稀少，春耕播种任务相当艰巨。为了解决这些困难，我们采取了早播的办法，在去年冬天，就根据省委防旱抗旱、抢墒早播的指示，打破常规，大胆尝试，冬播春小麦三十万亩。这不仅改变了耕作制度，而且调剂冬春忙闲不均，解决了春播时劳力、畜力紧张的困难，使今年的播种任务完成得又早、又快、又多、又好。目前这三十万亩冬播作物普遍生长良好，从而破除了“不能冬播”、“人少不能多种庄稼”等种种保守论调，为大力发展我们的农业生产提供了一个重要经验。
    目前，我州正处在大发展、大建设的新时期。我州和全省社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，迫切要求我们必须加紧工作，百倍努力，高速度地发展农业生产，大量增产粮食，以适应新形势飞跃发展的要求。为此，全自治州的各族人民决心乘胜前进，艰苦奋战，不断扩大播种面积，争取早日把海南建设成为新的粮仓。
    为了胜利地完成上述任务，今后我们必须做好下列几项工作：
    一、进一步加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，坚决贯彻执行农业是发展国民经济的基础和农业以粮为纲的方针。广种粮食，大搞农牧结合，大力发展农业生产，是各部门、各行业共同的责任。全体干部和各族人民必须一方面积极垦荒造田，不断扩大耕地面积；一方面继续坚决贯彻执行农业生产“八字宪法”，大建丰产方，提高单位面积产量，实现多种、高产、多收。
    二、全党动员，全民动手，加速农业技术改造。大办农牧机具制造厂和建立化肥基地，充分发挥现有的设备利用率，以提高生产能力，为农业提供更多的机械和优质肥料，加速实现农业的机械化和半机械化。
    三、根据“以小型为主，蓄水为主，社办为主”的三主方针和大中小相结合的原则，大搞群众运动，“三水”（雨水、河水、地下水）齐抓，同时要因地制宜地兴办小型水力发电站，向农业电气化道路迈进。
