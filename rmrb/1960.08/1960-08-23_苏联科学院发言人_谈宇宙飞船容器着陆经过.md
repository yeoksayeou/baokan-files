Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 22nd: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published on August 22nd a statement by a spokesman of the Soviet Academy of Sciences regarding the circumstances of the landing of the Soviet second spaceship.

The statement said that the spaceship landed on a flat grassy area of a Soviet collective farm. The first to witness this unusual sight were the members of the collective farm working in the fields. After seeing the container land, they immediately ran to surround it. They read on the container the instructions to immediately notify the relevant parties of the landing site. However, before the farm members had time to send a telegram, an observation plane arrived at the scene. The plane carried experts from various fields. They first opened the door of the container. Immediately, the dogs "Belka" and "Strelka" jumped out. They barked happily upon seeing the ground and the crowd. An hour later, a helicopter brought doctors. According to the doctors' examination, the animals were in normal health and had no injuries. On the night of the 21st, the four-legged cosmonauts arrived in Moscow. The spokesman of the Academy of Sciences said regarding the descent of the container that when the satellite spaceship was at a relatively low altitude, the container with the animals was ejected from the spaceship by ejection, which was to fully ensure the safety of the four-legged space travelers during landing. The satellite spaceship itself, like the container carrying the experimental animals, landed on the ground intact.

When the satellite spaceship reached its eighteenth orbit, a command to descend was issued from the ground. All the complex automatic mechanisms belonging to the safe landing system acted accurately and reliably. From the beginning of the descent, specialized equipment on the ground received data recording the operation of the braking device and the control system during the descent phase, and recorded data on the spaceship's passage through the atmosphere. This information is of great practical significance for future spaceship flights and their safe return to Earth.

### 苏联科学院发言人  谈宇宙飞船容器着陆经过

    苏联科学院发言人
    谈宇宙飞船容器着陆经过
    新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联“真理报”22日刊载了苏联科学院发言人关于苏联第二个宇宙飞船着陆时的情况的谈话。
    这篇谈话说，宇宙飞船是在苏联一个集体农庄一块平坦的草地上着陆的。首先看到这个不平常景象的人是在田地中工作的农庄庄员。他们看到容器着陆后，马上跑去把它围了起来。他们在容器上读到了要求将着陆地点立即通知有关方面的字样。但是，庄员还没有来得及发电报，一架观察飞机已经来到现场。飞机上载着各方面的专家。他们首先打开了容器的门。这时小狗“松鼠”和“小箭”立即跳了出来。它们看到地面和人群后愉快地叫了起来。一小时后，一架直升飞机载来了医生。据医生检查结果，动物的健康情况正常，身上没有任何伤痕。21日夜间，四足宇宙航行者抵达到莫斯科。科学院发言人谈到容器下降时说，当卫星式飞船位于不太高的空中时，带有动物的容器就用弹射的方法与飞船脱离，这是为了完全保障四足宇宙旅行者们着陆时的安全。卫星式飞船本身也与装有进行试验的动物的容器一样完整无损地降落到地面。
    卫星式飞船转到第十八圈时从地面发出了下降的命令。所有属于保证安全着陆系统的复杂的自动机械装置都准确可靠地行动了起来。降落一开始，地面上的专门设备就收到了纪录制动装置和在下降阶段控制系统工作情况的资料，录下了飞船经过大气层时的数据。这些资料对于将来的宇宙飞船的飞行以及其安全返回地球有着巨大的实际意义。
