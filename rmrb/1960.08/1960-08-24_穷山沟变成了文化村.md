    Poor Mountain Valley Transformed into Cultural Village
    Hao Kuiyuan, Principal of Xiejia Village People's School, Luoluo Commune, Xingtai, Hebei

    Before liberation, there were only thirteen poor peasant households in Xiejia Village. Due to the exploitation and oppression of feudal landlords, some families had to beg for food, and some were forced to flee from famine. Three of them had disappeared without a trace. In such a life of hunger and cold, there was no question of learning culture. Among the six households and thirteen people who remained in the village, not one was literate.

    After liberation, we, like the peasants of the whole country, turned over politically and economically, and had an urgent need to study culture. Especially after the establishment of agricultural producers' cooperatives in 1954, because there were no literate people, they could not keep records or do calculations, and grain distribution had to be done with ladles. We knew this method was unreasonable, but there was no way to solve it. The masses' demand for learning culture was truly like a thirst for water and a hunger for food. To solve this problem, we were determined to march towards culture. On the one hand, we sent the only two children in our village to primary school; on the other hand, we actively responded to the Party's call to establish year-round people's schools, and four young adults and two elderly people in their fifties all joined the literacy group.

    After organizing, there was no literate person in the village, so who would teach? We firmly believed that with the leadership of the Party, there would be a solution as long as we worked hard. Without a teacher, we decided to learn culture through self-reliance. We publicly elected the young man Hao Jiusheng to cross a mountain and go to the Huamu Village People's School, three or four li away from our village, to "obtain scriptures." He went there twice a week, learning one or two lessons each time, and then came back to teach everyone. He persisted year after year, regardless of wind or rain. At the same time, we mobilized the masses to seek teachers and visit friends to learn literacy. We stipulated that no matter who went to other villages, they had to learn a few characters and come back to teach everyone. Adults and children alike had to abide by this rule. For example, when my child wanted to visit relatives at his maternal grandmother's house, I would first ask, "Can you learn a few characters and bring them back?" The child agreed to learn one. I said, "You can't go unless you learn three characters." As a result, this child brought back three characters for us and became a small teacher of three characters. In addition, we were unwilling to let go of any opportunities to help students learn literacy. For example, when Hu Jinming, a teacher from Huamu Village People's School, came to hoe the ground near our village, we would invite him to lunch and ask him to use the time he spent going back and forth to teach the students to recognize characters. Another time, a peddler selling needles and thread came to the village. When we learned that he was literate, we also invited him to lunch and asked him to teach us a few characters. In this way, a literacy movement of "learning characters whenever you see them, asking people whenever you meet them" appeared in our village. Once, Hao Jiucheng went to Luoluo Town to attend a market and saw people playing chess. He learned the character "pao" (炮, cannon) on the chess piece and taught it to everyone when he returned home. Zhang Shouli went to Goujin Village and saw the character "que" (却, but). He didn't meet a literate person at the time, so he wrote it down as it was. He crossed a river and went to Baini Village to find the accountant Zhang Shouwen to learn the character "que." This valuable character was then brought back to the village. Usually, whoever saw a new character would write it down in a notebook and then gather them together. To learn culture, the students patiently, year after year, continuously accumulated characters one by one.

    After learning some characters, the students learned phonetic alphabets and how to use a dictionary from the teacher of Huamu Village People's School, and they could solve some new words and difficult phrases by themselves. In winter, the nights were long, and we studied until late at night. In summer, the nights were short, so we didn't rest at noon and studied under the shade of the trees. Hao Kuiyou, who was nearly fifty years old, wore reading glasses and insisted on studying until late at night every day.

    The rapid development of industrial and agricultural production further encouraged our desire to improve. After becoming literate, we "never left the saddle, never stopped the horse," and turned the literacy group into an amateur primary school group to study amateur primary school Chinese. During this stage of study, we relied on dictionaries as our teachers, focusing on self-study and mutual assistance, and also trying our best to get help from others. Zhang Shouli was self-studying the second volume of high school Chinese textbooks at the reservoir. He asked several people about the word "遗漏" (yilou, omission) before he understood it. Usually, when studying, we relied on checking dictionaries and studying together. We wrote down the parts that we didn't understand and went to Huamu Village to ask. At this time, the teacher of Huamu Village had become the head of the study station and had a good friendship with us. As long as he passed through the village, he would give us two lessons. Sometimes, he would come to our mountain valley to pick firewood, and we would give him a bundle of firewood in exchange for him giving us lessons during the time he spent picking firewood. Later, we also asked students who were at home for summer vacation to teach high school arithmetic. After learning arithmetic, everyone saw that the people in other villages were very skillful at using the abacus, and they also wanted to learn abacus calculation. Coincidentally, the township transferred Hao Kuimei to Beijing to work as a temporary worker. Everyone said, "There are many talented people in Beijing. Be sure to buy an abacus and learn how to use it." Hao Kuimei did not disappoint the villagers. He learned addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on the abacus in Beijing and taught it to the whole village when he returned. In the autumn of 1958, my second son graduated from high school, and I mobilized him to become a teacher in the people's school. From then on, we had a formal people's school teacher.

    After finishing the high school curriculum, some individuals developed the idea of "reaching the top of learning." Everyone said, "The Party calls on commune members to establish lofty aspirations, set great ambitions, and climb the peak of scientific culture. Does graduating from high school count as reaching the peak of scientific culture? Only by improving again and again can we live up to the Party's care." After improving our ideological understanding, in November 1959, we all transferred to amateur junior high school studies. Three young students also opened amateur junior high school mathematics classes. In addition to reading textbooks on time, they also subscribed to magazines and newspapers such as the *Hebei Daily*, *Xingtai Daily*, *Hebei Agriculture*, and *Current Affairs Handbook*, and purchased nearly a hundred popular reading materials, five or six dictionaries and thesauruses, and also bought a crystal radio. Everyone reads books and newspapers, and everyone listens to the broadcast of national events. Now the poor mountain valley has been transformed into a cultural village.

    穷山沟变成了文化村
    河北邢台路罗公社谢家沟民校校长　郝魁元
    解放前，谢家沟原有十三户贫苦农民，由于封建地主的剥削压榨，有的人家讨过饭，有的被迫逃过难，其中三户已经杳无音讯了。这样饥寒交迫的生活，当然谈不上学文化。留在村里的六户、十三个人，没有一个识字的。
    解放后，我们和全国农民一样，从政治、经济上翻了身，有了学习文化的迫切要求。尤其是1954年成立农业生产合作社以后，因为没有识字的人，不会记工算账，分配粮食时只好用瓢舀。明明知道这个办法不合理，也没有办法解决。群众学习文化的要求真是如饥如渴。为了解决这个问题，我们就下定决心，向文化进军。一方面把我村仅有的两个儿童送入小学；一方面积极响应党提出的建立常年民校的号召，四个青壮年和两个五十来岁的老年一齐参加了识字小组。
    组织起来后，村里没有识字的人，谁来教呢？我们坚决相信，有党的领导，只要干就有办法。没有老师，我们决定自力更生学文化。公推青年郝九生，翻一道山，到离村三、四里地的花木村民校去“取经”，每星期去两趟，每次学一、两课书，回来教大家。风雨无阻，常年坚持。同时，发动群众寻师访友来识字。我们规定：无论谁到外村去，都得学会几个字，回来教大家。大人小孩，人人都要遵守这个规定。比如，我的孩子要到外祖母家去串亲戚，我先问：“能学几个字回来？”孩子答应学一个。我说：“非学三个字不让去。”结果，这个孩子给我们捎回来三个字，当了三个字的小先生。另外，对于偶然遇到的一些可以帮助学员识字的机会，我们也不肯放过去。如花木村民校教师胡金铭，到我们村旁锄地时，我们便留他吃午饭，请他利用往返吃饭的时间教学员们认字。又有一次，村里来了个串乡卖针线的，当我们知道他识字的时候，也请他吃了一顿午饭，让他教几个字。就这样，在我村出现了“见字就学，见人就问”的识字运动。有一次，郝九成到路罗镇去赶集，看到人家下象棋，他就学会了棋子儿上的“炮”字，回家教给大家。张守利到沟近村去，见到一个“却”字，当时没遇到识字的人，他就照样写下来，过一道川，到白埝村找会计张守温把“却”字学会，这个宝贵的字又带回村来了。平时谁见到生字，就记在本上，集中起来。为了学文化，学员们就这样耐心地、常年累月地、一个字一个字地不断积累。
    当认了一些字以后，学员们又跟花木村民校教师学会了注音字母和查字典，可以自己解决一部分生字难词了。冬季夜长，一直学到深夜。夏天夜短，中午不休息，在树荫下学习。年近五十的郝魁有，戴着老花眼镜，每天坚持学到深夜。
    工农业生产的飞跃发展，更鼓舞了我们的上进心。脱盲后，我们“人不离鞍，马不停蹄”，把识字小组转为业余小学小组，学习业余小学语文。这一阶段学习是靠字典当老师，以自学为主，互相辅导，也尽量争取别人的帮助。张守利在水库上自学高小语文第二册课本，遇到“遗漏”一词，问了好几个人才弄明白。平时学习，我们靠查字典，互相研究，大家闹不懂的地方记下来到花木村去问；这时花木村的老师已作了学习站长，和我们有很好的友谊，只要从村经过，他就给我们讲两课，有时他到我们山沟拾柴火，我们就送给他一捆柴，请他用拾柴的时间给我们讲课。后来我们又让在家过暑假的学生教高小算术。学习算术以后，大家见外村人打算盘很俐落，又想学珠算。恰巧乡里调郝魁美去北京当临时工，大家说：“北京能人多，你千万买个算盘学会打。”郝魁美没有辜负乡亲们的嘱托，在北京学会了珠算的加减乘除，回来教给了全村。1958年秋天，我的二儿子高小毕业了，我又动员他当了民校教员，从此我们才算有了正式的民校教员。
    学完高小课程后，个别人产生了“学习到顶”的思想。大家说：“党号召社员树雄心，立大志，攀登科学文化高峰，高小毕业算不算登上了科学文化高峰？提高再提高，才能对得起党的关怀。”在提高思想认识后，1959年11月全部转入业余初中学习。三个青年学员还开了业余初中的数学课，除按时读课本外，还订了《河北日报》、《邢台日报》、《河北农业》、《时事手册》等杂志报纸，购买了近百本通俗读物，五、六本字典、词典，还买了一架矿石收音机。人人读书看报，个个听国家大事的广播。现在穷山沟已变成了文化村。
