Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai — Shanghai’s financial departments, starting with strengthening the financial management of people's communes, actively and enthusiastically assist suburban people's communes in managing their households, managing their finances, and running communes diligently and frugally, which has played a significant role in developing the suburban people's communes' economy.

This year, Shanghai's suburban agricultural production has continued to leap forward, and the people's communes' business projects have increased daily, and the scale of production has become larger and larger. This requires a corresponding strengthening of commune financial management. According to the instruction of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to manage the commune's financial work from start to finish, since February, the financial departments have sent more than eight hundred cadres to go deep into the production teams, living and eating with the commune members, working side by side, and under the leadership of the commune Party committee, assisting commune members to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, practice diligence and thrift, and manage commune finances well.

Through the preparation of financial plans and the expansion of production avenues, the Shanghai financial departments' important way to help communes increase income. The financial cadres who went deep into the production teams adopted various methods to offer ideas and act as "advisers" to help production teams to make plans. Some suggested that production teams use water surfaces and scattered land to expand feed planting; some suggested that production teams interplant vegetables in wheat and cotton fields to increase land utilization; and some helped production teams arrange labor to engage in diversified undertakings on a large scale. The financial cadres stationed in the Friendship Production Team of the Xingta Commune in Jinshan County worked with the commune members to tap production potential. By filling in low-lying fields, digging ditches, applying fertilizer, improving the soil, and developing diversified operations such as ramie and straw mushrooms, the team plans to increase its income by more than 29,000 yuan this year, and has already overfulfilled this target.

Some communes do need funds when implementing financial plans and developing production, so the banking departments take the initiative to deliver loans to their doorsteps. If some production teams lack seeds and technical strength, the financial cadres also help solve them as if they were their own difficulties.

In order to help commune members manage their household affairs well, the financial departments also helped promote mass economic accounting in some communes in Shanghai, Nanhui, Fengxian, Songjiang and other counties. The specific method is "three comparisons and three searches": the masses, based on the costs announced by the production team, adopt the method of comparing this year with the same period last year, comparing the plan with the actual, and comparing societies with societies and teams with teams to find problems, find gaps, and find experience. Because the commune members have mastered the accounting tools, everyone keeps accounts and manages finances, and the sense of responsibility and awareness of being masters of their own affairs have been greatly improved, and at the same time, it has promoted the further development of the competition of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping. Seventy-six production teams in the Xingang Commune in Nanhui County, through accounting by crop type, reduced the cost of summer crops by 10.4% this year compared with last year.

The financial departments also helped communes and production teams save expenditures by using the four-pronged approach of checking (checking the materials needed for production), digging (tapping the potential of materials), sorting (sorting out the surplus and shortage of materials), and adjusting (organizing adjustment), and also helped communes establish a series of systems such as financial plan management, property and material storage, economic accounting, work evaluation and scorekeeping, and democratic management. These were all established around the central work of different periods. When the commune Party committee comprehensively arranged the lives of commune members with grain as the center, they helped establish and improve the financial management system of the canteen. Now 86% of the rural canteens in the suburban areas of the city have achieved separate accounts for accounts, money, and grain, clearing accounts daily and settling accounts monthly, clearly and clearly. When the commune sorted out the warehouse during the summer harvest and summer planting, it also helped establish a set of warehouse management system, so that 70% of the grain and other material warehouses in the city can be managed by someone for everything, every item has a record, and there are vouchers for entry and exit. At the same time, the financial departments also vigorously helped communes train cadres. In the past six months, through centralized training and other methods, they have improved the political and professional level of more than 9,000 financial personnel in communes and production teams, and also assisted communes in selecting a group of commune members with good political ideology and active work to serve as accountants, and taught them technology. Now many people are able to work independently.

### 八百名财政金融干部深入郊区生产队当“参谋”  上海郊区公社开源节流管好财务

    八百名财政金融干部深入郊区生产队当“参谋”
    上海郊区公社开源节流管好财务
    据新华社上海讯　上海财政金融部门从加强人民公社财务管理入手，积极热情地帮助郊区人民公社当好家、理好财、勤俭办社，对发展郊区人民公社的经济起了很大作用。
    今年，上海郊区农业生产持续跃进，人民公社的经营项目日益增多，生产规模越来越大。这就要求相应加强公社财务管理。财政金融部门根据中共上海市委提出把公社财务工作一竿子到底管起来的指示，2月份以来派出了八百多个干部深入生产队，与社员同吃同住，并肩劳动，在公社党委领导下，协助社员开源节流，克勤克俭，管好公社财务。
    通过编制财务计划，广辟生产门路，是上海财政金融部门帮助公社增加收入的重要途径。深入生产队的财政金融干部采取各种方法出主意、当“参谋”，帮助生产队订计划。有的建议生产队利用水面、零星土地扩大饲料种植；有的建议生产队在麦田、棉田里插种蔬菜提高土地利用率；还有的帮助生产队安排劳力，大搞副业。派在金山县兴塔公社友好生产队的财政金融干部，和社员一起挖掘生产潜力。这个队通过把低荡田填高，开沟、施肥，改良土壤和发展麻茹、草菇等多种经营办法，今年计划收入比去年增加二万九千多元，目前已经超额完成了这一指标。
    有些公社在执行财务计划、发展生产时确实需要资金，银行部门就主动把贷款送上门。有些生产队缺少种籽和技术力量，财政金融干部也当作自己的困难一样帮助解决。
    为了帮助公社社员管好家务，财政金融部门还在上海、南汇、奉贤、松江等县的部分公社中帮助推行群众性的经济核算。具体做法是“三比三找”：群众根据生产队公布的成本，采取今年与去年同期比，计划与实际比，社与社、队与队比来找问题、找差距、找经验。由于社员们掌握了核算工具，人人算账，个个理财，当家作主的责任感和自觉性大大提高，同时也促进了比、学、赶、帮竞赛的进一步开展。南汇县新港公社七十六个生产小队通过按作物种类进行核算，今年夏熟作物的成本比去年降低10.4％。
    金融财政部门还帮助公社、生产队用查（查生产所需的物资）、挖（挖掘物资潜力）、排（排出物资余缺）、调（组织调剂）四结合的办法节约支出，并且帮助公社建立了财务计划管理、财产物资保管、经济核算、评工记分、民主管理等一系列制度。这些都是围绕不同时期的中心工作建立起来的。当公社党委以粮食为中心，全面安排社员生活时，他们就帮助建立和健全食堂财务管理制度，现在全市郊区86％的农村食堂已经做到账、钱、粮分开记账，日清月结，清清楚楚。在夏收夏种公社整理仓库时，又帮助建立一套仓库管理制度，使全市70％的粮食和其他物资仓库做到样样有人管、笔笔有记录、进出有凭证。与此同时，财政金融部门还大力帮助公社培训干部，半年来通过集中训练等方式，提高了九千多名公社、生产队财务人员的政治业务水平，并且协助公社选拔了一批政治思想好、工作积极的社员担任会计，向他们传授技术。现在很多人已能独立工作。
