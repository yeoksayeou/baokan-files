    Increase Production of High-Quality Steel in Multiple Varieties

    When the People's Daily editorial "Immediately Launch a Production Increase and Thrift Campaign Centered on Grain and Steel" was broadcast on the loudspeaker, our entire workshop immediately erupted. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely respond to the Party's call and do everything possible to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's steel production plan.

    Our workshop is mainly engaged in the production of special steel types. Therefore, not only must the output be higher and higher, and the quality better and better, but we must also produce more new steel types, especially scarce steel types, to meet national needs. As of August 17th, the steel output of the entire workshop had completed 84% of the annual national plan, the qualified rate of steel ingots reached 98.7%, and 125 new and old steel types were produced according to the plan. Other indicators, such as the utilization coefficient of electric furnaces, the consumption of metal materials, and costs, have also maintained or reached the advanced national level.

    In August, we discussed the production plan for this month. The furnace, shift, and team all issued indicators for quality, output, variety, and raw material consumption. Every worker discussed measures to complete these indicators, setting off a new upsurge in production.

    The key to electric furnace steelmaking is the transformer. We have improved some transformers, so that the power exerted by some electric furnace transformers has increased from 80% to 100% of their capacity. Now, we are learning from the advanced experience of Benxi Iron and Steel Company in reforming transformers and electric furnaces, striving to further tap the potential of electric furnaces.

    We have strengthened the trial production of new varieties. The leadership first explained the smelting requirements of new varieties to everyone, and everyone discussed them. Special personnel were assigned to be responsible for raw material processing, allocation, and other production preparation work. During production, the furnace chief uniformly directed, and the operating experience of producing new steel types was summarized at any time, striving to produce a furnace of high-quality steel with each furnace.

### 增产多品种的优质钢

    增产多品种的优质钢
    当人民日报发表的“立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”的社论在扩音器里广播时，我们全车间立即沸腾起来。大家一致表示决心：坚决响应党的号召，千方百计地为完成和超额完成今年钢铁生产计划而奋斗。
    我们车间是以生产特殊钢种为主的车间。因此，不仅要产量高了再高，质量好上加好，还要生产更多的新钢种，特别是稀缺钢种，来满足国家需要。到八月十七日，全车间钢产量已经完成全年国家计划的百分之八十四，钢锭合格率达百分之九十八点七，按计划生产了一百二十五种新旧钢种，其他指标，如电炉利用系数、金属材料消耗、成本等，也都保持或达到了全国先进水平。
    八月份，我们讨论了本月生产计划，炉、班、小组都下达了质量、产量、品种、原材料消耗等指标，每个工人讨论了完成这些指标的措施，掀起了一个新的生产高潮。
    电炉炼钢的关键是变压器。我们已改进了部分变压器，使有些电炉变压器发挥的功率由以前的百分之八十提高到百分之百；现在，我们又学习本溪钢铁公司改革变压器和电炉的先进经验，争取更大地发挥电炉的潜力。
    我们加强了新品种试制工作。领导上先把新品种冶炼要求向大家交底，由大家讨论，并设有专人负责原材料加工、配备等生产准备工作；生产时由炉长统一指挥，随时总结生产新钢种的操作经验，争取做到炼一炉就出一炉优质钢。
