Xinhua News Agency, August 16th dispatch from Elisabethville: As the American-controlled "United Nations Force" continues to pour into the Katanga province of Congo, intensifying its control over this resource-rich province, demonstrations against the colonialists and the Tshombe clique, who are attempting to split Congo, have erupted in the cities of Elisabethville, Jadotville, Mulongo, and Kolwezi.

In Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga province, Congolese youth held demonstrations. Police of the Tshombe authorities threw tear gas at the demonstrators.

In the African residential area of Jadotville, one of the mining centers of Katanga province, people raised the flag of the Republic of Congo on the 15th, expressing their support for a unified Congo. Jadotville is one of the regions where the struggle against colonialism in Katanga province is on the rise. The Congolese people there have recently been continuously fighting against the followers of the puppet Tshombe, who is supported by imperialism.

The Tshombe secessionist "government" issued a communiqué on the evening of the 14th, saying that on the evening of the 13th in Jadotville, a group of demonstrators, holding the flag of the Republic of Congo, shouted slogans against the UN Secretary-General, against the UN, and in support of Congolese Central Government Prime Minister Lumumba. The communiqué admitted that the secessionist "government" authorities killed and wounded five demonstrators each in the suppression. The communiqué threatened to "punish most severely" the so-called "troublemakers."

In the city of Mulongo in northeastern Katanga province, Congolese youth launched a struggle against the colonialists last weekend. It is reported that the Belgian colonialists there are panicking and have concentrated in several central areas to deal with the demonstrators.

Faced with the vigorous struggle of the Congolese people in these places against imperialism and its running dogs, the "United Nations Force," which had just entered Katanga province, rushed to Jadotville and Kolwezi on the 14th and 15th to play the role of so-called "maintaining order."

It is reported that the "United Nations Force" authorities are continuing to increase their troops to Katanga province. On the 15th, four more companies of the "United Nations Force" were airlifted to Elisabethville. According to a dispatch from Leopoldville by United Press International, the United Nations will increase its forces stationed in Katanga province to 4,000.

Xinhua News Agency, August 16th dispatch from Leopoldville: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba made five demands on Hammarskjöld in a letter published on the 15th, and said: The Congolese government and people have "lost confidence" in UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld.

The five demands made by Lumumba are: (1) The Congolese army should immediately take over all airports in Congo from the "United Nations Force." (2) Provide aircraft to transport the Congolese army to all parts of Congo. (3) Immediately confiscate all weapons and ammunition distributed by Belgians in Katanga and hand them over to the Congolese government. (4) Immediately send non-white troops and Congolese troops to Katanga. (5) Withdraw non-African troops from Katanga.

The Congolese Prime Minister also said in the letter that Hammarskjöld colluded with the Belgians in his actions in Congo. Lumumba said that Hammarskjöld was an "accomplice in Katanga's secessionist activities" and condemned him for "disregarding the completely legitimate government of the Republic."

Lumumba also stated in the letter that a Congolese government delegation will travel to New York with Hammarskjöld to present Lumumba's views at the UN Security Council. It is reported that Hammarskjöld will report to a special meeting of the Security Council on the differences with the Congolese government on the use of the "United Nations Force" in Congo.

Xinhua News Agency, August 14th dispatch from Elisabethville: UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, who has been working for the entry of the "United Nations Force" manipulated by the United States into the Katanga province of Congo, conducted a black market transaction with Tshombe, who is supported by imperialism, in Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga province, on the 12th and 13th, behind the back of the Congolese government.

According to a communiqué issued by the Tshombe secessionist "government," the result of this transaction is: the "United Nations Force" manipulated by the United States will replace the Belgian army in the wealthy Katanga province, and the Tshombe government will be able to exercise the "political" and "administrative powers" necessary to maintain the existing structure of Katanga province completely freely and independently.

Tshombe, who calls himself the "President" of Katanga, also openly put forward his proposal to establish a "Confederation of the United States of Congo" to split Congo in another communiqué issued after meeting with Hammarskjöld.

In a radio address on the evening of the 13th, Tshombe said triumphantly that "the main results we hoped to achieve have been achieved" in the talks with UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld.

It is reported that the "United Nations Force," personally led by Hammarskjöld, had already begun taking over the airport in Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga province, from the Belgian army on the 13th. When this "United Nations Force" arrived in Elisabethville on the 12th, the Congolese people there booed in protest. However, despite the opposition of the Congolese people, the UN Secretary-General also announced that other "United Nations Forces" would be heading to Katanga province on the 15th or 16th.

Hammarskjöld's activities in Katanga province have been opposed by the Congolese people there. Yesterday and today, many Congolese in Elisabethville held demonstrations in front of the UN Secretary-General's residence, opposing the plot to split Congo and demanding support for Congo's independence and unity.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, August 15th: The US Air Force Command at the Wiesbaden Air Base in West Germany announced today that the US 322nd Air Division has resumed an emergency mission since yesterday to transport 4,100 UN reinforcements and 500 tons of supplies to Congo.

This batch of troops includes a battalion from Ireland. This is the second battalion that Ireland has sent to Congo. The 700 officers and soldiers and 135 tons of equipment of the Irish battalion will take off from Dublin, the capital of Ireland, on Wednesday to Congo.

US Air Force planes have already transported the first batch of 760 people and 50 tons of supplies to Congo today. According to the US Air Force Command in Wiesbaden, this airlift mission will continue until early September.

    保卫祖国统一　反对分裂阴谋
    刚果加丹加人民展开爱国斗争
    卢蒙巴谴责哈马舍尔德是加丹加分裂活动的同谋者
    新华社16日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：正当美国操纵的“联合国军”源源开入刚果加丹加省、加紧控制这个资源丰富的省份的时候，这个省的伊利沙伯维尔、贾多特维尔、穆隆果和科耳威济等城都爆发了反对殖民者、反对企图分裂刚果的冲伯集团的示威。
    在加丹加省首府伊利沙伯维尔，刚果青年举行了示威。冲伯当局的警察向示威者投掷催泪瓦斯弹。
    在加丹加省的矿产中心地之一的贾多特维尔城的非洲人居住区，人们在15日升起了刚果共和国国旗，表示他们支持统一的刚果。贾多特维尔城是加丹加省反对殖民主义斗争的高涨地区之一。那里的刚果人民最近不断同帝国主义扶植的傀儡冲伯的追随者进行斗争。
    冲伯的分裂“政府”14日晚上发表一项公报说，13日晚上在贾多特维尔，一群示威者手持刚果共和国国旗，喊着反对联合国秘书长、反对联合国和拥护刚果中央政府总理卢蒙巴的口号。这项公报承认，分裂“政府”当局在镇压中打死打伤示威者各五人。公报威胁要“最严厉地惩处”所谓“事端制造者”。
    在加丹加省东北的穆隆果城，刚果青年在上周末发动了反对殖民主义者的斗争。据报道，那里的比利时殖民者惊慌失措，已经集中在几个中心区以对付示威者。
    面对这些地方刚果人民蓬勃开展的反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，刚刚开入加丹加省的“联合国军”14日、15日就赶往贾多特维尔和科耳威济等城充当所谓“维持秩序”的角色。
    据报道，“联合国军”当局正在继续不断地增派军队到加丹加省去。15日，又有“联合国军”四个连空运到伊利沙伯维尔。据合众国际社从利奥波德维尔发出的一条消息透露，联合国将把它驻在加丹加省的兵力增加到四千人。
    新华社16日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴在15日公布的信件中向哈马舍尔德提出了五项要求，并说：刚果政府和人民已经对联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德“失去信心”。
    卢蒙巴提出的五项要求是：（一）立即由刚果军队接替“联合国部队”来接管刚果的所有机场。（二）提供飞机把刚果军队运送到刚果全国各地去。（三）立即没收比利时人在加丹加散发的全部武器和弹药，并把它们交给刚果政府。（四）立即派遣非白人军队和刚果部队到加丹加去。
  （五）从加丹加撤走不是非洲人的军队。
    刚果总理在信中还说，哈马舍尔德在刚果采取的行动中同比利时人勾结。卢蒙巴说哈马舍尔德是“加丹加分裂活动的同谋者”，并且谴责他“漠视完全合法的共和国政府”。
    卢蒙巴在信中还表示，一个刚果政府代表团将同哈马舍尔德一起前往纽约以便在联合国安全理事会上申述卢蒙巴的观点。据报道，哈马舍尔德将在安全理事会特别会议上报告在刚果使用“联合国军”问题上同刚果政府的分歧。
    新华社14日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：为美国操纵下的“联合国军”开进刚果的加丹加省而奔走的联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，12日、13日背着刚果政府，在刚果加丹加省省会伊利沙伯维尔同由帝国主义扶植的冲伯进行了一笔黑市交易。
    据冲伯的分裂“政府”发表的一项公报透露，这次交易结果是：美国操纵下的“联合国军”将在富庶的加丹加省接替比利时军队，而冲伯政府将能够完全自由和独立地行使为维护加丹加省现有结构所必要的“政治”和“行政职权”。
    这个自封为加丹加“总统”的冲伯在同哈马舍尔德会谈之后发表的另一项公报中，还公然提出他的关于成立“刚果合众国邦联”的分裂刚果的主张。
    冲伯在13日晚上在广播演说中洋洋得意地说，在同联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的会谈中，“我们希望取得的主要结果已经实现。”
    据报道，这次由哈马舍尔德亲自带领去的“联合国军”13日已经开始从比利时军队手中接管了加丹加省首府伊利沙伯维尔的机场。这支“联合国军”12日开到伊利沙伯维尔时，那里刚果人民纷纷发出嘘嘘声，表示抗议。但是不顾刚果人民的反对，联合国秘书长还宣布，其他一些“联合国军”将在15日或者16日开往加丹加省。
    哈马舍尔德在加丹加省的活动遭到那里刚果人民的反对。昨天和今天，伊利沙伯维尔许多刚果人在这位联合国秘书长住所前面举行示威，反对分裂刚果的阴谋，并且要求支持刚果的独立和统一。
    新华社波恩15日电　美国驻西德威斯巴登空军基地司令部今天宣布，美国第三百二十二空军师从昨天起又开始执行一项紧急任务，把四千一百名联合国增援部队和五百吨物资运到刚果去。
    在这一批军队中包括爱尔兰的一个营。这是爱尔兰派往刚果的第二个营。爱尔兰营的七百名官兵和一百三十五吨装备将在星期三从爱尔兰首都都柏林起飞到刚果去。
    美国空军飞机今天已经把第一批七百六十人和五十吨物资运到刚果去。据威斯巴登的美国空军司令部宣布，这次空运任务将继续到9月初。
