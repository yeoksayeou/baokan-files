Xinhua News Agency, August 21st, TASS Moscow, August 20th: The Soviet Union's second satellite spaceship has returned to the designated area after completing seventeen orbits around the Earth. The cosmonauts – "Squirrel," "Arrow," and other animals – have all safely returned to Earth.

TASS reporters learned from the Soviet Academy of Sciences about the preliminary summary of the new outstanding medical-biological experiments conducted during the launch of this spaceship.

Several mice, along with "Squirrel" and "Arrow," completed the journey in the spaceship's sealed cabin. The "passengers" also included some flies, plants, fungi, microalgae, and seeds of certain plants. They were sent into space to study the long-term effects of cosmic radiation on living organisms. Scientists conducted systematic observations of the dogs. Their condition was visible on the screens of television sets. The lives of "Squirrel" and "Arrow" during a period of flight were virtually spent before the experimenters' eyes. Observers saw the animals' postures and movements, and recorded the eating habits of one of the dogs.

The instruments transmitting basic physiological functions of the animals worked very accurately. During the flight, a large number of electrocardiogram recordings were obtained, recording the animals' heart sounds, blood pressure, respiratory rate and characteristics, and their movements. All the information was transmitted from the spacecraft to the ground by radio.

Throughout the entire flight, the specified conditions of the spaceship's internal environment – air pressure, temperature, air humidity, and composition – were automatically maintained.

According to the preliminary analysis of the materials obtained from the spaceship, it has been proven that conditions close to ground life have been created for organisms on the satellite spaceship. The only exception is the factor of weightlessness. However, the animals quickly adapted to weightlessness.

The scientists are very satisfied to confirm that the system ensuring the safe return of containers with animals to the ground worked reliably. The spaceship passengers have returned to Earth. Comprehensive research is now being conducted on the animals, and the large amount of scientific material obtained is being processed.

Xinhua News Agency, August 21st, TASS Moscow, August 21st: The participants in the Soviet Union's second satellite spaceship's outstanding medical-biological experiment – the two dogs "Arrow" and "Squirrel" and other animals and plants – arrived in Moscow by plane today.

The animals and plants that participated in the flight returned to Earth in good condition.

TASS reporters learned from the Soviet Academy of Sciences that the animals' landing was not only an extremely complex technical task but also the most difficult part of space travel because this stage had extremely high physiological stress. "Squirrel" and "Arrow" had to endure severe physical "overload." However, judging from their movements, condition, and general appearance, they got through the entire flight and its final stages very well.

After landing, the dogs' condition was no different from what was seen during ground training in preparation for the flight. A few hours after landing, "Arrow" and "Squirrel" had a very good appetite and ate the food given to them, and they preferred to eat "Laika" brand shortbread (the brand name of the shortbread was in memory of the first space traveler – the dog "Laika"), disliking sausage.

As soon as the two dogs came out of the satellite spaceship container, they immediately wagged their tails at those who often worked with them, expressing affection.

After "Squirrel" and "Arrow" arrived in Moscow, they took a bath, and their electrocardiograms and heart sounds were recorded, and their blood pressure was measured. The results of the analysis of the materials obtained by the physiologists prove that their condition is still normal.

The condition of other test subjects is also very good. The mice happily gnawed on "Sports" brand crackers and other food. The flies continued to buzz in the bottles they had occupied when they completed their space travel. Among the plants that had been placed on the spaceship, one flowering plant was gradually blooming.

Detailed observations of this group of animals that have been to interplanetary space are still continuing.

    第二个宇宙飞船完成生物学试验
    生物在宇宙飞行中一路平安
    飞船已为生物创造了接近于地面生活的条件
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社莫斯科20日电：苏联第二个卫星式宇宙飞船在围绕地球走完了十七圈以后回到地面预定地区。宇宙航行家们——“松鼠”、“小箭”和其它动物都已平安回到地面。
    塔斯社记者自苏联科学院获悉了关于发射这个飞船期间实现的新的卓越医学——生物学实验的初步总结。
    几只老鼠同“松鼠”和“小箭”一起乘宇宙飞船密封舱完成了旅行。“乘客”中还有一些苍蝇、植物、真菌、微藻和某些植物的种籽。它们被送入宇宙的目的是利用它们考察宇宙辐射对活机体的远期影响。科学家对狗进行了系统的观察。在电视机的萤光屏上看见了它们的情况。“松鼠”和“小箭”在一段飞行时期中的生活实际上等于在实验者眼前度过的，考察者看到了动物的姿势、动作，记录到了一只狗的进食情况。
    传送动物基本生理机能情况的仪器工作得十分精确。在飞行期间获得了大量心动电流图的记录，记录到了动物的心音、血压、呼吸的频数和特征以及它们的动作。所有的情报都通过无线电从飞船上传至地面。
    整个飞行期中，飞船内环境的规定条件：气压、温度、空气的湿度和成分都是自动保持的。
    根据从飞船上获得材料的初步整理结果证明，在卫星式飞船上已经为生物创造了接近于地面生活的条件。只有失重的因素是例外。但是，对失重情况动物很快就适应了。
    科学家们十分满意地确定，保证带有动物的容器安全返回地面的系统，工作得很可靠。宇宙飞船的乘客重新回到地面上来了。现在正在对动物进行全面研究，并且对已获得的大量科学材料进行整理。
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社莫斯科21日讯：苏联第二个卫星式宇宙飞船卓越的医学—生物学实验的参加者——“小箭”和“松鼠”两只小狗以及其它的动植物，今天已乘飞机到达莫斯科。
    参加飞行的动植物返回地面情况良好。
    塔斯社记者自苏联科学院获悉，动物着陆不仅是极复杂的技术任务，而且也是宇宙旅行中最困难的一段，因为这一段生理紧张程度是极高的。“松鼠”和“小箭”必须经受严重的身体“超重”。然而，根据它们的动作、状况和一般外貌看来，它们很好地渡过了整个飞行及其最后阶段。
    在着陆以后，狗的状况同在准备飞行期间地面训练时看到的状况没有什么不同。在着陆几小时以后，“小箭”和“松鼠”食欲很好，吃了给它们的食物，而且它们宁愿吃“莱伊卡”牌酥糖（酥糖的这个牌字是为纪念第一位宇宙旅行家——小狗“莱伊卡”而起的），不喜欢吃香肠。
    两只狗刚从卫星式飞船容器中出来，就立即对那些经常同它们一起工作的人摇头摆尾，表示亲热。
    “松鼠”和“小箭”到莫斯科以后洗了个澡，对它们的心动电流图和心音作了记录，测量了血压。分析生理学家们已获得的材料的结果证明，它们的状况依然是正常的。
    其它的试验对象情况也都很好。老鼠很高兴地啃着“体育”牌粗饼干和其它食物。苍蝇继续在它们完成宇宙旅行时所居留的瓶子里嗡嗡地飞。曾经放在宇宙飞船上的植物中，有一株鲜花正在陆续开放。
    对曾经到过行星际空间的这批动物的详尽观察，尚在继续中。
