Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: Recently, two batches of Overseas Chinese from Indonesia returned to the motherland and were warmly welcomed. One group of compatriots arrived at Zhanjiang Port on the "Anshun" ship on the 14th, and the other group arrived in Guangzhou on the "Haishun" ship on the afternoon of the 7th.

The compatriots who returned to the motherland on the 14th included not only some Palembang Overseas Chinese students returning to study, but also most of the Overseas Chinese small business people from South Sumatra Province and Beisheng who lost their livelihoods in anti-Chinese activities, as well as some Overseas Chinese from Palembang and other places who were unwilling to continue residing in Indonesia. The compatriots were very excited after returning to the embrace of the motherland and expressed their desire to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland along with the people of the whole country.

The compatriots who returned to Guangzhou on the 7th came from Medan, Sibolga and other places in North Sumatra Province. Among them, most were unemployed workers and small vendors who lost their livelihoods in anti-Chinese activities, and some were elderly plantation workers who were unreasonably dismissed by foreign plantation owners.

When this group of Overseas Chinese gathered in Medan to prepare to return to China, representatives from the Medan and Tinggi Indonesian-Chinese Friendship Association and the Tinggi Indonesian Women's Association specially came to see them off and presented them with fruit. In their conversations, the representatives praised the broad masses of Overseas Chinese for their contributions to various aspects of the local area, and believed that the Overseas Chinese and the local people had formed a deep friendship in their long lives. The representative of the Women's Association said that the friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese people will last forever. When you return to the motherland, please send our regards to the Chinese people.

    表示要积极参加祖国建设
    新华社17日讯　近日有两批印度尼西亚华侨回到祖国，受到热烈欢迎。一批侨胞乘“安顺”号轮船在14日抵达湛江港，另一批乘“海顺”号轮船在7日下午到达广州。
    14日回到祖国的侨胞，除了一部分是回国升学的巨港华侨学生外，大部分是南苏门答腊省和碑生在排华活动中丧失生计的华侨小商人，以及一些不愿意继续居留在印度尼西亚的巨港等地华侨。侨胞们回到祖国怀抱后都很兴奋，纷纷表示要和全国人民一道，积极参加祖国社会主义建设。
    7日回到广州的侨胞，来自北苏门答腊省棉兰、实武牙等地。其中，大都是失业工人和在排华活动中丧失生计的小商贩，还有一部分是被外国种植园主无理解雇的、年老的种植园工人。
    这批华侨在棉兰集中准备回国时，棉兰、丁宜印度尼西亚中国友好协会和丁宜印度尼西亚妇女会的代表特地前来欢送，并赠送果品。代表们在谈话中，赞扬广大华侨对当地各方面所作出的贡献；并且认为在长期的生活中，华侨和当地人民已经结成深厚的友谊。妇女会的代表说，印度尼西亚和中国人民的友谊是万古长存的，你们回到祖国，请代我们问候中国人民。
