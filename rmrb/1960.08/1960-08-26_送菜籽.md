Sending Vegetable Seeds
Haoran

Around noon, the white flour steamed dumplings from the cafeteria had just been taken out of the steamer. The cooks were busy washing vegetables, and Meng Zhaoxian, the head of the vegetable team, flew into the courtyard like a swift swallow.

This nineteen-year-old girl, tall and slender, with a round face and delicate eyebrows, had a thick braid tied with a bright red ribbon swaying behind her, which further accentuated her clever and lively spirit. At this moment, her face was flushed, and beads of sweat hung on her forehead and nose. She walked up to Aunt Meng, who was cutting squash, and asked, slightly out of breath, "Mom, is there any mail for me?"

Before her mother could speak, several women sitting nearby couldn't help but giggle. This laughter amused Zhaoxian, and she grabbed her mother's arm and shook it, saying, "Mom, give it to me quickly, there must be one."

Her mother deliberately glared at her, pretending to be annoyed, and said, "People are laughing at your crazy behavior! You're always in a rush, like you're on fire. Mail, mail, who would write to you?"

Zhaoxian pouted in disappointment, paused for a moment, and then asked, "Has the mailman been here? He always comes here for water, didn't you see him?"

Her mother said, "I didn't see him. Don't be like this..." Before the girl could finish her words, she flew out the door again. Her mother sighed deeply.

Meng San's wife, who was both washing vegetables and nursing her baby, interjected, "I never heard that your eldest daughter was seeing anyone; it was only after she came back from buying vegetable seeds at the market that she became restless and always eagerly awaited mail."

Aunt Li Si also chimed in, "Zhaoxian is a smart girl, no need to worry about her, she'll surely find herself a good husband."

Listening to the neighbors' comments, Meng Da Niang felt pleased. Which mother doesn't worry about her daughter's marriage? However, these past few days, her daughter hasn't been eating well or sleeping soundly. She felt sorry for her and also harbored a bit of resentment towards that person, thinking to herself: if you're going to write, then do it quickly, don't torment my child like this! She walked to the door and looked out, seeing her daughter standing straight as usual by the lotus pond, waiting for the mailman, and couldn't help but sigh again.

Standing under the willow shade by the lotus pond, Meng Zhaoxian stared blankly and anxiously at the small road to the west, hidden by the green cornfields. How she wished that, at this very moment, a green bicycle would suddenly burst out from there, and in the blink of an eye, stop in front of her, handing her a stack of letters. Her eyes were sore from looking, but still no sign of him. She counted the days on her fingers: one day, two days, three days... How fast, it's been a whole five days! Just five days ago, she had done something that she thought was very clever. That day, she went to the market to buy vegetable seeds again, and once again came back empty-handed. Everywhere was expanding vegetable fields, and everywhere was shouting about a shortage of seeds. Without seeds, plans and harvests would fall through. In a moment of quick thinking, the girl bought a large sheet of red paper from the store, and borrowed a pen and ink from the elementary school, and wrote a "small notice" in duplicate:

To responsible comrades of production teams in various regions:

Our team is responding to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and needs to plant a large amount of autumn vegetables, but we have no seeds. The commune has already solved half of our needs, but we are still short half, and we have been returning empty-handed from purchasing everywhere. We are now asking you for help. If you have surplus seeds, no matter how much, please write to us, and we will immediately bring funds to purchase them, and will be endlessly grateful.

With respect,

Vegetable Team of Xiaomenjiatan Production Team
Team Leader Meng Zhaoxian

She posted the two notices on both ends of the street in Baozhuang Market. On the way back, she was full of joy, feeling that this method was more widespread and faster than running around everywhere and making phone calls. When she returned home, she proposed a plan to her father, the production team leader: in addition to the existing ten mu of vegetable fields, reserve another ten mu. Her father got angry as soon as he heard this, and said:

"Is there anyone who plans production like you? The seeds are still hanging in the air, and you reserve the land and wait! Do you know that it's already the Beginning of Autumn, and if you don't plant in seven days, the land will be wasted, and will you be responsible for the wasted land?" Meng Zhaoxian said, "Then give me a seven-day deadline, if no letter comes in seven days, you can plant your buckwheat as you please."

The seven-day deadline passed in the blink of an eye, and in those five days, she felt that time was both fast and slow. She was so anxious that she couldn't eat, and blisters appeared on the corners of her mouth; she couldn't sleep well, and for several nights she dreamed of carrying large bags of vegetable seeds on her shoulders. Guaranteeing an average of 500 jin of vegetables per person in the team, this task weighed heavily on the girl! She felt that, no matter what the reason, failing to complete the task would be letting everyone down, and whether the task was accomplished or failed was written in the short few days on the ledger. The seasons wait for no one, it was extremely urgent, and the damn mailman still wasn't coming!

Meng Zhaoxian scolded others for no reason, looked up and saw that the sun had already passed noon. According to her estimation, the mailman must have already come, perhaps he delivered the letter to the team headquarters. She rushed to the team headquarters, but the door was locked. She started cursing the old accountant in her heart. Then, she bent over the window, and peered through the paper, like a person lost in the dark who suddenly sees a red light in front of them, the girl's heart suddenly lit up: on the desk, there were four small cloth bags piled up, each with "Meng Zhaoxian" written on it. This was truly good fortune falling from the sky. In a rush she began to knock on the door, wanting to find the accountant, and unable to wait, she jumped onto the windowsill, tore open the paper with her hand, and jumped in. She grabbed all four small cloth bags in her hand, afraid of being scolded by her father or the accountant, she didn't dare to stay any longer. She jumped out again, pasted the paper back on the window as if nothing happened, and ran towards the vegetable garden without looking back. After walking a long way, she finally slowed down a little, picked a white cloth bag, tore open the stitching, and inside were blackish-purple vegetable seeds, along with a letter. She quickly scanned it, it said: "Comrade Meng Zhaoxian, we don't have many vegetable seeds left, we managed to scrape together a pound, it's too little, please forgive us..." Below it was written "Sent by Bidu Production Team, Tanbu Commune". She tore open another cloth bag, and the words written on it moved the girl even more: "I originally wanted to plant these half a jin of vegetable seeds in my private plot, but seeing that you are short of seeds, let's prioritize the collective over the individual, don't worry about me, it's only two fen of land, I can transplant some seedlings from my neighbors..."

The girl's eyes were moist, she hugged the four cloth bags tightly in her arms, as if feeling heat coming from their insides, warming her heart. How many sincere hearts these were!

As she walked, happy, and admiring the scenery, after a splashing sound, a person emerged from the reeds.

This person came out of the reeds, dropped the small package on the small stone bridge, held onto a small poplar tree with one hand, rinsed his muddy feet in the water, put on his shoes, looked up and discovered Meng Zhaoxian walking towards him, forgetting to tie his shoelaces, he shouted loudly, "Comrade, is this Xiaomenjiatan?"

The girl Meng Zhaoxian felt that when she was happy, everyone looked pleasing to her, and she loved to talk to everyone. At this moment, she smiled and replied, "Yes, yes, this is Xiaomenjiatan. Where are you from, comrade? Are you here to visit relatives?"

The young man had already walked over. Tall and thin, with a square face and two bright, shining eyes that were particularly energetic. Blue cloth pants rolled up over his knees, revealing thick thighs; a snow-white cloth shirt was open, revealing a white undershirt worn on his broad chest, with a line of small words printed on the undershirt, the small words were "Xiashan Reservoir Engineering Headquarters"; below the small words was a large "Award" character, dazzlingly red. Seeing such a dignified demeanor, the girl couldn't help but feel respect for this stranger. The young man then asked, "Excuse me, where does Comrade Meng Zhaoxian, the head of the vegetable team, live?"

The girl was taken aback: "Looking for me?"

The young man laughed, revealing a mouthful of neat white teeth and said, "You are? That's great!"

The girl asked doubtfully, "You are... How come I don't recognize you?"

The young man said generously, "I'm Wang Yuanqing from Yuejin Commune, Anqiu County, Henan. I'm here to bring you vegetable seeds."

Anqiu County is separated from Changle County by the Wen River, and Yuejin Commune is more than thirty li away from Xiaomenjiatan. How did he know that we were short of seeds so far away? And come all this way to deliver them in person, the girl was so grateful that she couldn't speak. She stepped forward, picked up the package from the ground, and said, "You really troubled yourself, how can we thank you?" She felt that the package was heavy, and said again, "How much vegetables do you plant, to have so many seeds left over?"

The young man said, "The other day I came across the river to study the indigenous method of manufacturing chemical fertilizer at your county's Tanbu Commune, and I passed by Baozhuang, and saw the notice you wrote. When I got back to the team, I told the captain, and the captain and the storekeeper investigated, and we had already planted all our vegetables, and swept up all the remaining seeds to support other communes. I knew you were in a hurry, you wouldn't have posted that notice if you weren't. I went door to door and collected these ten or so jin."

The young man spoke about this matter very plainly, but Meng Zhaoxian deeply understood. For these ten or so jin of vegetable seeds, this young man went door to door, not knowing how many roads he had to walk, how many words he had to say, how anxious he had to be, how much sweat he had to shed. This spirit of rushing to help others was truly admirable. She said, "You suffered for these things. You could have just written a letter or sent them, why did you have to trouble yourself with the journey?"

The young man said, "I originally wanted to send them, but the captain said that he had been to your place before and knew that you didn't have the habit of growing vegetables and lacked the technology, so he gave me two days to not only send the seeds, but also study the planting methods with you."

This was even better news. Meng Zhaoxian said, "Really, you all thought of everything so thoroughly. I was worried about this, there's no need to say, you're a vegetable-growing expert. Our team just established a vegetable team, and I don't know anything, now I'll worship you as my teacher. Quick, let's go, let's find a place to rest in the village."

The young man declined, saying, "There's no need to go back to the village, let's just go to your vegetable garden, I have to rush back tomorrow morning."

At this moment, Aunt Meng emerged from the reeds. She had been there for a while, hiding in the reeds. Everything was seen clearly, and heard clearly. She liked such a young man from the bottom of her heart. She said, "It's past noon, how can you not eat and rest? Look, I've already brought dumplings, come on, let's go home and eat!"

To solve the vegetable seed difficulties, aid came from all directions, adding unparalleled joy and strength to Xiaomenjiatan. In the afternoon, the old team leader also transferred twenty strong laborers to assist the vegetable team in planting vegetables, and appointed Wang Yuanqing, the guest from afar, as technical guidance.

When they arrived at the vegetable garden, the young man seemed particularly active, just like he was in his own production team. As soon as he arrived, he proposed an important reform: changing broadcasting to row planting and hole planting, resulting in saving half of the seeds and planting ten more mu of vegetables. This alone was enough to make the people of Xiaomenjiatan, especially the enthusiastic and eager-to-learn Meng Zhaoxian, sincerely admire him. During sowing, he first gave a demonstration. He sowed so evenly, pinched so finely, and the soil was covered so smoothly and consistently, that everyone cheered.

After half a day and one night of hard work, Wang Yuanqing said goodbye and went home the next morning. The old team leader and the people from the vegetable team sent him out of the village, all expressing their reluctance to part with this young man. Meng Zhaoxian's usual lively energy was gone, she was silent and sent him straight to the Wen River. She held the young man's hand tightly, unable to say a thousand words: "Comrade Yuanqing, how can we thank you?"

The young man glanced at the girl, his face suddenly turned red, and said, "There's no need for anything, I hope you grow the best Chinese cabbage and radishes, that's the best thanks for us."

Meng Zhaoxian insisted, "We will definitely guarantee it. Just, I hope you'll come again in the autumn and see it with your own eyes."

The young man took off his sneakers, waded across the river, and the girl watched him, waving frequently. She was thinking, watching the young man's gradually receding figure: Wang Yuanqing's arrival left behind seeds, left behind technology, and also left behind an unforgettable impression that was difficult to explain at the moment. At this moment, Aunt Meng rushed over, shouting loudly, "Quick, stop him! He left the cloth bag for holding the seeds."

Meng Zhaoxian snatched the cloth bag from her mother's hand and said playfully, "Don't shout. If he doesn't come to get it in the autumn, I'll send it to him."

    送菜籽
    浩然
    傍晌，食堂的白面蒸饺刚揭笼，炊事员们正忙着洗菜，蔬菜组组长孟昭仙，像穿云的小燕一般飞进院子里。
  这个十九岁的闺女，细高个，圆脸盘，弯眉俊眼，一根扎着水红头绳的大辫子，在背后一摇一摆，这就更增加了她那机灵、活泼的神气。这时，她满脸通红，脑门和鼻梁上挂着汗珠，走到正切方瓜的孟大娘跟前，微微有些气喘地问道：“娘，有我的信吗？”
    没等娘开言，坐在旁边的几个妇女就忍不住嘻嘻地笑起来了。这一笑，倒把昭仙给笑乐了，扯住娘的胳膊摇着：“娘，快给我，一准有。”
    大娘故意嗔怪地瞪她一眼，说：“人家笑你这派疯相哩！一天到晚烟烧火燎的样子，信，信，可有谁给你写信来？”
    昭仙扫兴地噘起嘴巴，停了停又问：“投递员来过吗？他每次过都要到这里找水喝，你没见他？”
    娘说：“没有见。别这样……”闺女没有听完她的话，就又飞出门外，她深深地叹口气。
    又洗菜又奶娃娃的孟三嫂这时插言说：“从前没听说你家大妹子跟谁搞对象；就是从上集买菜籽回来，变得定不住神，总是火爆爆地盼信。”
    李四婶也插言说：“昭仙是个精明的闺女，用不着你挂神，保险给你搞个好女婿来。”
    孟大娘听着邻里们的议论，心里美滋滋的，有几个做娘的不惦记闺女的婚事？可是，这几天闺女吃饭不甜，睡觉不香，她有些心疼，又有几分恨那个人，暗自想：要写信就快些，这样折腾俺孩！她走到门口望了望，见闺女又像往日一样，直竖竖地站在藕湾边等候投递员，不由得又叹口气。
    孟昭仙站在藕湾边的柳荫之下，两眼呆呆，焦急地盯着西边那条被青纱帐掩遮的小路，她是多么希望，就在这个时候，忽地从那里冲出一辆绿色自行车，眨眼到她跟前跳下来，递给她一叠子信。眼都望的发酸，依旧不见个影子。她又扳着手指头算日子：一天、两天、三天……多快呀，整整五天了！就在五天前，她办了一件自以为很聪明的事情。那一天，她又一次赶集买菜籽，又一次扑空了。到处都在扩大菜田，到处都喊叫缺种子，没有种子，计划、丰收都要落空。姑娘急中生智，就地从商店里买了一张大红纸，又从小学借了笔砚，一式两份，写了一个“小启事”：各地生产队负责同志：
    我队响应党中央、国务院的指示，要大量播种秋菜，可是没有种子。公社已经为我们解决一半，还缺少一半，到处购买，都空着手回来，现在向你们求援。你们若有余种，不管多少，请写信来，我们马上携款前去购买，将不胜感谢。
    敬礼
    小孟家滩生产队蔬菜组
    组长孟昭仙启
    她把两份启事，分别张贴在包庄集的街两头。回来的路上，她满心高兴，她觉得，这样的办法比到处跑、到处打电话要普遍、要快的多。回到家，她就跟当生产队长的爹提出计划：除原有十亩菜田外，再留地十亩。爹一听就火了，说：
  “天下还有你这样安排生产的？种子还在空中悬着，先把地留下来死等！你知道眼下已经是立秋了，再有七天不下种，地就白了，白了地你负责？”孟昭仙说：“那你就留给我七天限期吧，七天不来信，你随便种你的荞麦。”
    七天限期，一转眼过去了五天，这五天，她觉得又快又慢，急的饭吃不下，嘴角上起了火泡；觉睡不香，好几个晚上她都梦见大口袋菜籽背在肩上。保证全队每人平均五百斤菜，这个任务把姑娘压的不轻呵！她觉得，不论什么原因，任务完不成，都对不起大家，而任务是实现，还是落空，就写在这样短短几天的账本上了。节令不等人，万分火急，该死的投递员还不来！
    孟昭仙无端地骂着别人，抬头看看，太阳已经转过午了，据她估计，投递员一定来过了，或许把信送到队部里。她急急忙忙往部队跑去，不想队部的屋门倒锁着。她又开始在心里骂老会计。随后，趴在窗台上，透过冷布朝里看去，像是大黑天走迷路，前边忽地出现了一盏红灯一般，姑娘心倏地一亮：办公桌上，堆着四个小布袋，每个布袋上都写着“孟昭仙”。这真是喜事从天降，急得她乱敲门，想去找会计，又等不及，一窜跳上窗台，用手一撕，把冷布扯开，纵身跳进去，把四个小布袋一齐抓在手，怕爹或会计回来挨骂，她没敢多停留，就又跳出来，消踪灭迹地把冷布虚贴在窗上，就头不回地往菜园里跑。走出好远，她才稍微放慢脚步，拣一个白布袋，把缝线拆开，里边是黑紫黑紫的菜种，还有封信，她一目十行地扫一遍，上边写着：“孟昭仙同志，俺们菜籽留的不多，好不容易凑一斤，太少了，请原谅……”下边写着“鄌郚公社毕都生产队寄”。她又扯开另一个布袋，上边写的话更使姑娘感动：“俺这半斤菜籽原想种在自留地里，见你们缺种，就先集体后个人吧，也不要为俺担心，只二分地，俺可以从邻居移些苗子栽上……”
    姑娘两眼潮湿了，她把四个布袋紧紧地搂在怀内，仿佛觉出，从它们的内部发出热来，直暖她的心房。这是多少颗赤诚的心呵！
    正在她边走边乐边观景的当儿，前面一阵趟水声之后，从苇丛那里，闪出一个人来。
    这个人出了苇丛，把身上的小包裹丢在小石桥上，一手扳着小杨树，在水里涮净了泥脚，穿了鞋子，一抬头发现走过来的孟昭仙，鞋带子没顾结，高声打招呼：“同志，这是小孟家滩吗？”
    孟昭仙这个姑娘心里若是一高兴，见谁都顺眼，见谁都爱说话，这时，她笑迷迷地回答说：“是，是孟家小滩。同志从哪来，可是到这庄走亲？”
    小伙子已经走过来了。细高个，四方脸，两只乌光闪亮的眼睛特别有精神。蓝布裤卷过膝，露出粗壮的大腿；雪白的布衫开着怀，露出穿在宽大胸膛上的白背心，背心上印着一行小字，小字是“峡山水库工程指挥部”；小字下是一个大的“奖”字，耀眼红。见这般气派，姑娘对这个陌生人不由得产生一种敬意。小伙子又问：“请问，蔬菜组组长孟昭仙同志在哪住？”
    姑娘吃了一惊：“找俺？”
    小伙乐了，露出满口整齐的白牙齿说：“你就是？太巧啦！”
    姑娘疑惑地问道：“你是……我怎么不认识？”
    小伙子大方地说：“俺是河南边安丘县跃进社的，俺叫王元庆，来给你们送菜籽。”
    安丘县跟昌乐县隔着汶河，跃进社离小孟家滩三十多里路，这么远，他怎么知道俺们缺种？又这样不辞辛苦亲自来送，姑娘感激得说不出话来，上前去，从地下拾起包袱，说：“真麻烦你了，让我们可怎么谢呢？”她觉得包袱里沉甸甸的，就又说：“你们种多少菜，余下这么多种子？”
    小伙子说：“那天我过河来，到你们县的鄌郚公社学习土法制造化肥，路过包庄，看见你写的那张启事。回到队里，我向队长一说，队长跟保管员一调查，我们的菜都已经种上，余下的全打扫净，支援别的社了。我知道你们很急，不急，你不会贴那个启事，我就挨门一把一把凑了这十来斤。”
    小伙子把这件事情说得很平淡，但是，孟昭仙深有体会，为这十来斤菜种，这个年轻人挨门挨户，不知要走多少路，说多少话，着了多少急，流了多少汗，这种赴难助人的精神，真是可敬可佩。就说：“为这些事，让你吃了苦。写封信或者寄来就是了，何必还劳你跑路。”
    小伙子说：“原来也是想寄来，队长说，他过去到你们这边来过，知道你们没有种菜习惯，缺乏技术，就给我两天时间，除送种，再跟你们一块儿研究一下种法。”
    这更是天大的喜事了，孟昭仙说：“真是呀，你们想得真周到哇，我正为这事发愁哩，不用说，你是种菜能手了，我们队刚成立蔬菜组，我是什么也不懂，现在就拜你当老师。快，走吧，到村里找个地方歇歇。”
    小伙子推辞说：“不用回庄里了，就到你们菜园去吧，明早我还要赶回去。”
    这时，孟大娘从苇丛那边闪出来了。她已经来到多时，隐在芦苇那边。一切都看得清清楚楚，听得真真切切，对这样一个年轻人，从心里喜欢。就说：“天过午了，不吃饭不歇歇还行？你看，我已经领来饺子，走，回家吃吧！”
    为解决菜种困难，四面八方都伸来援助的手，给小孟家滩增添了无比的喜悦和力量。下午，老队长又调了二十个棒劳力，协助蔬菜组突击种菜，推远来的客人王元庆为技术指导。
    到了菜园里，这个小伙子显得特别活跃，就像在他家的生产队里一样。一上场，他就提出一件重要改革：把撒播改为条播和穴播，结果省下一半种子，多播了十亩菜。就这一点，就够小孟家滩的人，特别是热情、好学的孟昭仙心服口服的了。播种时，他先作示范，他撒的那么匀，捻的那么细，土复的既平又一致，使得人人喝彩。
    半天、一夜的苦战过去了，第二天清早，王元庆告辞回家。老队长和蔬菜队的人，把他送出村去，对这个年轻人都表示了难舍难离。孟昭仙往日那派活泼劲不见了，她不声不响，直送到汶河边。她紧紧地握住小伙子的手，千言万语难以说出口：“元庆同志，让我们怎么谢你们呢？”
    小伙子看了姑娘一眼，脸蛋忽地红了，说道：“什么也不用，希望你们长出最好的大白菜、大萝卜，就是对我们最好的感谢。”
    孟昭仙坚持地说：“一定保证。只是，希望你秋后再来，亲眼看一看。”
    小伙脱下球鞋，趟着河过去了，姑娘目送着他，频频招手。她望着小伙子渐渐去远的背影，正在想着：王元庆这次到来，留下了种子，留下了技术，也留下了一时讲不清而难忘的印象。这时，孟大娘赶了来，大声喊着：“快叫住他！他把盛种子的布袋留下了。”
    孟昭仙一把从娘手里把布袋夺过来，挑皮地说：“别喊了。秋后，他要是不来取，我就给他送去。”
