New Developments in Factory-Commune Hookups: A Good Way to Support Agriculture
    Lingchuan County Establishes Factory-Commune Collaboration Support Networks by Region
    Solved the Contradiction of Uneven Factory-Commune Hookup Support, Enabling All Communes in the County to Receive Strong Industrial Support
    (Reported by this newspaper) Shanxi Province's Lingchuan County, in its industrial support for agriculture, has, on the basis of factory-commune hookups, implemented multiple combinations, building networks by region, encompassing regions with networks, and providing comprehensive support, thus greatly advancing industrial support for agriculture.

    New Contradictions Emerge in Factory-Commune Hookups
    Lingchuan County's twenty county-run factories and mines have, since the beginning of this year, adopted the form of factory-commune hookups to support agriculture, achieving great results. However, an industrial unit is often limited by its production nature, production capacity, and other factors, and cannot meet the needs of agriculture. As a result, in industrial support for agriculture, there emerged "two争" [two "striving" or "competing" situations]: Many communes were vying to hook up with large factories; vying to hook up with machinery factories and fertilizer factories. Initially, the Beiguan Machinery Factory was only hooked up with the Xishadi Commune, which greatly helped this commune. Later, Cheng’guan, Pingcheng, and four other communes also requested to hook up with the machinery factory, but as a result of the excessive workload and dispersed strength, the support tasks could not be completed. The Yuanzhuang Sulfur Factory provided counterpart support to the Qinjiazhuang Commune. In the first half of this year, all seventy-five tons of fertilizer produced were supplied to the Qinjiazhuang Commune, while the Gujiao, Liuquan, and other communes, which were very short of fertilizer, did not receive any support.

    From Single Hookups to Regional Collaboration
    In order to make overall arrangements, accelerate agricultural technological transformation, and make industrial support for agriculture more organized and planned, the Lingchuan County Party Committee, in late April of this year, based on the principle of facilitating the unified use of forces for comprehensive support, formed an Agricultural Support Committee, headed by the county Party committee secretary in charge of industry, and with the participation of leading cadres from relevant departments such as industry, agriculture, culture and education, and health. Among the county's twenty county-run factories and mines, large-scale collaboration and large-scale combinations were implemented. According to the layout of the county-run factories and mines and the distribution of the communes, the county was divided into four regions and four networks. For example, the Cheng’guan Commune and the Lucheng and Gongshui Communes in the southeast, with the Beiguan Machinery Factory and the Dongpo Sulfur Factory as the backbone, combined the Beiguan Coal Mine, Hardware Factory, Printing Factory, and Textile Factory, and absorbed the Lucheng Commune Agricultural Repair Factory and the Gongshui Commune Machinery Factory into one region and one network; the Yetao, Gujiao, and Liuquan Communes in the northeast of the county seat, with the Zhao Zhangshui Coal and Sulfur Mine, located fifteen li [7.5 km] from the city, and the Yetao Machinery Factory, located twenty-five li [12.5 km] from the city, as the backbone, combined the Yetao Iron Factory and the Gujiao Ceramics Factory, and absorbed the Liuquan Agricultural Repair Factory into one region and one network. This close coordination in building networks by region, closely combining county-run industry and commune industry, unified forces, and provided comprehensive support, bringing the county's factory-commune hookups to a new stage. Within each region's support network, the Party committee secretaries of each factory and the commune Party committee secretaries formed an industrial support for agriculture guidance group. Within the factories and mines, a support for agriculture group was also formed, headed by the factory director, and with the participation of the directors of each workshop. This greatly strengthened the planning and organization of industrial support for agriculture, and brought new development to cooperation within industry. In the recent struggle against drought alone, the county's "four networks" provided agriculture with forty-seven sets of irrigation and drainage machinery, eleven sets of power machinery, four hundred and eighty flatbed carts, three hundred and sixty-seven tons of fertilizer, and nine point six tons of pesticides. At the same time, they trained more than two hundred and sixty various technical personnel for agriculture, enabling all two hundred and fifty-five management areas of the county's communes to receive strong industrial support.

    New Forms Generate New Strength
    Lingchuan County's building of networks by region and encompassing regions with networks, this new form of support greatly strengthened the planning and organization of industrial support for agriculture, facilitating the drawing of strengths and offsetting weaknesses, and the adjustment of surpluses and deficiencies. Before the establishment of the network, the Liyi Commune was hooked up with the machinery factory and urgently needed a large amount of fertilizer in the fight against drought. It ran all over the county's sulfur factories, but all had hookup targets and could not be resolved. Conversely, more than fifty sets of irrigation and drainage machinery were damaged in the Qinjiazhuang and Pingcheng Communes, and because the sulfur factories hooked up with these two communes lacked the technical strength for mechanical repairs, they could not be repaired in time. After the establishment of the network, the Yuanzhuang Sulfur Factory, in order to further exert its special role, under the collaboration and support of other factories and mines in the network, vigorously engaged in the comprehensive utilization of sulfur ore, and the output of fertilizer increased three times compared to before. All fifty-four management areas of the three communes encompassed by the entire network received fertilizer support. At the same time, twelve repair workers were drawn from the network and, after a five-day crash course, all the damaged irrigation and drainage machinery was utilized and put into the fight against drought.

    Through building networks by region, internal cooperation within industry was further promoted. The various factories and mines of the county-run industry, as well as the county-run industry and the commune-run industry, twisted into a single force, thereby generating new strength. Before the establishment of the network, the Xihedi Commune only had a lathe, and the finished products had to be processed in Jincheng County. Conversely, the Fucheng Commune had a drilling machine but no lathe, and the finished products had to be processed in Cheng’guan. Therefore, both companies had difficulties in producing irrigation and drainage machinery. After the establishment of the network, the two factories vigorously engaged in cooperation, and from June onwards, they produced forty-seven units in one month. From May onwards, the county produced a total of four hundred and sixty-seven irrigation and drainage machines in three months, which was two times higher than before the establishment of the network. In July, the Cheng’guan Machinery Factory was repairing small flatbed carts for the Shangjiao Reservoir, and there was a shortage of raw materials. After the Hehou Foundry Factory learned of this, it immediately supplied more than two hundred and seventy wheel rims and three hundred pairs of axle skins. Comprehensive cooperation and support further promoted the development of industry. After the establishment of the network, the total industrial output value of the county reached four million and seventy thousand yuan in three months, an increase of 29.2% compared to the three months before April.

    Through building networks by region, not only was the role of different types and different natures of factories in supporting agriculture fully utilized, but also, through factories leading factories and factories promoting factories, commune industry was armed in many ways. After the establishment of the network, in order to fundamentally solve the technical strength problem of supporting agriculture, the factories took the initiative to adjust eleven sets of power machinery, sixteen large and small lathes, twenty-one electric motors, six generators, thirty-nine sets of alligator pliers, five sets of indigenous-style internal combustion engines, forty-nine tons of raw materials, and three hundred and fifteen technical personnel, greatly strengthening the commune industry.

    厂社挂钩的新发展　支援农业的好办法
    陵川县分片建立厂社协作支援网
    解决了厂社挂钩支援不平衡的矛盾，使全县各公社都得到工业的有力支援
    本报讯　山西省陵川县工业支援农业，在厂社挂钩的基础上，又实行了多行组合，以片建网，以网包片，综合支援，使工业支援农业向前大大地推进了一步。
    厂社挂钩出现新矛盾
    陵川县二十个县营厂矿，从今年以来，采取厂社挂钩的形式支援农业，曾作出很大成绩。但是，一个工业单位常常受生产性质、生产能力等方面的限制，不能适应农业的需要。因而在工业支援农业上，出现了“两争”：许多公社都争着要和大厂挂钩；争着要和机械厂、化肥厂挂钩。开始北关机械厂光和西沙底公社挂钩，对这个公社帮助很大。后来城关、平城等六个公社也都要求和机械厂挂钩，结果由于任务过重，力量分散，以致支援任务完不成。原庄硫磺厂对口支援秦家庄公社，今年上半年，生产的七十五吨化肥，全部支援了秦家庄公社，而化肥很缺的古郊、六泉等公社，却没有得到支援。
    由单一挂钩到分片协作
    为了统筹安排，加速农业技术改造，使工业支援农业更加有组织、有计划，中共陵川县委于今年4月下旬，根据便于统一使用力量全面支援的原则，由县委管工业的书记挂帅，吸收工业、农业、文教、卫生等有关部门领导干部参加，组成了支援农业委员会。在全县二十个县营厂矿之间，实行了大协作、大组合。根据县营厂矿的摆布和公社的分布状况，将全县分为四片四网。例如，城关公社与东南方面的潞城、栱水两公社，以北关机械厂、东坡硫磺厂为骨干，组合北关煤矿、五金厂、印刷厂、纺织厂并吸收潞城公社农修厂、栱水公社机械厂为一片一网；县城东北方面的冶头、古郊、六泉三个公社，以距城十五里的赵漳水煤磺厂和二十五里的冶头机械厂为骨干组合冶头铁厂、古郊陶瓷厂吸收六泉农修厂为一片一网。这样密切配合分片建网，县营工业和公社工业紧紧结合，统一力量，全面支援，使全县的厂社挂钩，又进入了一个新的阶段。在每一片的支援网内，又以各厂的党委书记和公社党委书记组成了工业支援农业指导组。在厂矿内部，也以厂长为首，吸收各车间主任组成了支援农业小组。这样就大大加强了工业支援农业的计划性、组织性，使工业内部的协作又得到了新的发展。仅在最近一段抗旱斗争中，全县“四个网”，就为农业方面支援了排灌机械四十七部，动力机械十一部，平车四百八十辆，化肥三百六十七吨，农药九点六吨。同时又为农业培养了各种技术人材二百六十多名，使全县各个公社的二百五十五个管理区都得到了工业方面的有力支援。
    新的形式产生了新的力量
    陵川县工业以片建网，以网包片，这种新的支援形式大大加强了工业支援农业的计划性、组织性，便于取长补短，调剂有无。在建网前礼义公社与机械厂挂钩，在抗旱中急需大量化肥，跑遍了全县硫磺厂，但都有挂钩对象，就没有得到解决。相反秦家庄、平城公社，损坏了排灌机械五十多部，因和这两个公社挂钩的硫磺厂缺乏机械检修的技术力量，不能及时修理。建网后，原庄硫磺厂为了进一步发挥本厂的特殊作用，在网内其他厂矿的协作支援下，大搞硫磺矿综合利用，化肥产量比以前提高了三倍。全网包片的三个公社五十四个管区，都得到了化肥支援。同时又从网内抽出了十二名修理工人，经过五天突击，使损坏的排灌机械，全部利用起来，投入了抗旱斗争。
    通过以片建网，也进一步促进了工业内部的协作。县营工业的各个厂矿之间以及县营工业和社营工业之间扭成了一股劲，从而产生了新的力量。在建网前，西河底公社只有旋床，加工成品还得到晋城县去，相反附城公社有钻床没旋床，加工成品又得到城关，因此两家生产排灌机械都有困难。建网后，两个工厂，大搞协作，从6月开始，一个月即生产四十七台。全县从5月开始，三个月时间共生产排灌机械四百六十七部，比建网前提高两倍。7月份城关机械厂为上郊水库修理小平车，原料不足。后河翻砂厂知道后，马上供给了车圈二百七十多副，轴皮三百对。全面的协作支援，进一步促进了工业的发展。建网后三个月全县工业总产值达到四百零七万元，比4月份以前的三个月增长29.2％。
    通过以片建网，不仅充分发挥了不同类型、不同性质的工厂对支援农业的作用，而且通过以厂带厂、以厂促厂，还多方面地武装了公社工业。建网后，各厂为了从根本上解决支援农业的技术力量问题，主动地调整出动力机械十一部、大小车床十六部、电动机二十一部、发电机六部、老虎钳三十九套、土锅驼机五部，原材料四十九吨，技术人员三百一十五人，大大加强了公社工业。（附图片）
