The responsibility of a Chinese revolutionary writer is what? The Party has pointed it out to us very clearly. That is: through creative work, vigorously raise the communist ideological consciousness and communist moral qualities of the people throughout the country. This is the task that the Party and the masses have put forward to us, because the socialist society for which the Party leads the people of the whole country to struggle arduously has become a reality today. And it is the great communist ideal that inspires people to forge ahead courageously.

This task is arduous, but it is also glorious. Moreover, as long as we correctly embody the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism in our creative practice, this task can be accomplished. According to my personal experience, this creative method should first be reflected in the shaping of heroic figures. Because generally speaking, a writer's work, what most arouses the reader's concern, and what has the greatest impact on the reader, is always the characters first. Writers also often devote most of their energy to character creation. Therefore, writers should carry out diligent labor to create figures with communist style for our great era, and use vivid images with communist style to inspire millions of people to advance bravely.

To create characters with a communist style in works, there is a full realistic basis. Because in our great and boiling real life, many new people with a communist style have emerged, and new things with communist sprouts have become widespread. Recently, I lived in the rural areas of Wusheng, Sichuan for a period. Wusheng is a red flag county in Sichuan, and its changes are amazing. There is a Li'an Commune in the county with extremely barren soil; especially in the first and second management districts, there are cobblestones everywhere underground, just like a river beach. But our heroic people have made it grow green crops covering the mountains and plains. The reason why they were able to create this miracle is not just to increase grain production, but is closely linked to a great ideal. I fully felt this in my contact with the masses. And these heroic people who are working hard to quickly change our country's backward situation of "poverty and blankness," and to transition our country to a communist society as soon as possible, have given me great inspiration.

Thinking of the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of the county, I have a lot to say. Of course, time does not permit me to do so; but I can't help but talk about a competition that I participated in in the Liemian District. There is a Qiaoting Commune in this district. Because of a shortage of sweet potato vines and fertilizer, production lagged behind, and the competition failed. And the tall and strong Party Secretary of the Liemian Commune insisted on challenging it, and encouraged several other communes to keep an eye on Qiaoting. But in the end, he took the lead in making a guarantee to Qiaoting: if you don't have fertilizer, we will lend you two thousand catties of sweet potato vines! Come and carry them tomorrow morning. And he immediately walked out of the noisy meeting place and called back to the commune to arrange the sweet potato vines. Just like all over the country, this kind of story full of communist spirit of cooperation can be said to be commonplace in the rural areas of Sichuan after the people's communes.

Literary and artistic works are powerful weapons for the Party to conduct socialist and communist ideological education among the masses of the people. In order to make it play a greater educational and inspiring role among the broad masses, we must fully idealize the characters we create in our creations. Of course, the idealization we are talking about is based on real life, and it has nothing in common with fabrication that is divorced from reality. Because these new characters with a communist style exist in real life, and their thoughts and styles are also formed in the complex struggles of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The so-called making the characters more idealized is nothing more than summarizing the communist qualities of many living people in real life, especially emphasizing some new sprouts in the character of living people that will be more common in the future. That is, to improve on the basis of summarizing real life. In "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," when Chairman Mao talked about the difference between literary and art in natural form and conceptual form, he pointed out that literary and art as a conceptual form "should be higher, more intense, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than ordinary actual life." Chairman Mao elaborated this brilliant instruction very thoroughly, and it should become the common principle for us to idealize characters. Because it is a scientific conclusion drawn from summarizing all creative experience.

I think that to meet the requirements that Chairman Mao put forward to us, we must first have rich life experience, and we must use the Party's viewpoints and policies to conduct in-depth analysis and research on these life experiences, so as to provide a deep and reliable foundation for concentrated generalization in creation. And what is more important is that we must be able to look far ahead and feel and express our great and boiling real life from the ideological height of communism, so that the works are permeated with an inspiring spirit of revolutionary romanticism. In the past year, I have done some thinking about the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, and I have increasingly felt that revolutionary romanticism should be the dominant aspect. Because whenever I think of revolutionary romanticism, I always think of the Marxist-Leninist theory of continuous revolution at the same time, and the theory of continuous revolution is the strategic ideology guiding class struggle. So I think that if we consider the issue of revolutionary romanticism from this perspective, we can more consciously and profoundly reflect the great and boiling real life of "one day equals twenty years" and the spiritual outlook of the broad masses, and we can more enthusiastically praise those heroes who constantly overcome difficulties, overcome all kinds of ideological obstacles, and pave the way for a new life, so that the broad masses of readers can advance bravely together with the characters in the works.

Many of our works that are welcomed by readers have greater inspiring power in reflecting the depth of real struggle life and character shaping. For example, the three novels "Red Flag" (Liang Bin), "Entrepreneurship" (Liu Qing), and "Red Sun" (Wu Qiang) all embody the spirit of revolutionary romanticism in different aspects and to different degrees. The authors enthusiastically praised those heroes who were selfless and fearless for the sake of collective interests and revolutionary interests. In short story creation, when everyone reads "A Warm Snowy Night" (Liu Baiyu), won't they feel inspired, and thus be reminded of the heroic spirit of the working people of the whole country fighting for a great ideal? And when I think of that "My First Superior" (Ma Feng) who was usually lazy and listless, but "ran as fast as lightning" with a stick when the work was tense, and the Party Secretary of the commune who re-mobilized those pessimistic and disappointed people in "In Critical Moments" (Wang Wenshi) and threw them into new battles, I can't help but think of those rural cadres I know who are working hard for a great ideal, and I yearn to write them out.

What I mentioned above are some works by some professional writers. Even the works of worker-peasant-soldier amateur writers have made great achievements in embodying the requirements of the Party and the masses. Especially the works of a group of worker-peasant-soldier young authors that have emerged since the Great Leap Forward. Taking Sichuan alone, there are several worker-peasant-soldier amateur authors who have written well. Of course, for them, this is just a beginning. But when I think of that semi-retired old worker in "Spring Night" (Cai Feng) who secretly learned needlework from a widow and secretly made bellows, I am always very excited. Because the reason why this old worker is determined to make his arm, which was crippled by whipping in the old society, flexible, is not for anything else, but to strive to return to his beloved work post, so that our country can catch up with the UK in less than fifteen years. I also think of the new communist customs that permeate the "Welding" (Du Fu) field. And that nurse who was blinded on the Korean battlefield because she rescued the wounded, and then painstakingly learned massage and patiently treated patients, can be called a "Never Withered Flower" (Huang Mouyuan) in our society...

Sometimes, when some young friends talk to me about how to embody the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism in creation, especially the spirit of revolutionary romanticism, I always think of those memoirs of revolutionary struggles that have educated the broad masses (maybe because these works are easier to explain the problem). And I get inspiration from them: the author himself must first be a proletarian fighter who shares the same breath and destiny with the masses, and constantly struggles to realize the great revolutionary ideal, in order to truly solve the problem. Because the fundamental reason why these works not only correctly describe the past history of revolutionary struggle, but also permeate the spirit of revolutionary optimism and revolutionary heroism lies here. What flows out of the blood vessels is blood, and what flows out of the water pipes can only be water. Around 1931, I wrote a short story called "Terror," which aimed to expose the bloody crimes of the reactionaries, but as a result, it revealed my own negative emotions at the time. I believe that I would never write such a thing now, and this old work from thirty years ago fully illustrates that: in creative issues, it always directly involves the author's own thoughts, feelings, spiritual state, and entire worldview, and there is no faking it at all.

"The essay is the person," this is an idiom that everyone knows. I think that now we should give this idiom new content and new explanations. That is: to perfectly embody the spirit of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism in creation, the author himself must be a person who fully possesses a communist style. And the rich experience since the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in 1942 proves that as long as we honestly continue to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, go deep into life and struggle for a long time, integrate with the masses from action to thoughts and feelings, and resolutely advance along the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we can completely do it.

    作家的责任	沙汀
    中国革命作家的责任是什么呢？党为我们指得十分明确。这就是：通过创作，大力提高全国人民的共产主义思想觉悟和共产主义道德品质。这是党和群众对我们提出来的任务，因为党领导全国人民为之艰苦奋斗的社会主义社会，已经成为今天的现实了。而鼓舞人们勇往直前的正是伟大的共产主义理想。
    这个任务是艰巨的，但也是光荣的。而且只要我们在创作实践中正确体现了革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，这个任务是能够完成的。根据我个人的体会，这个创作方法，首先应该体现在英雄人物的塑造上。因为一般地说，一个作家的作品，最能引起读者关心，对读者影响也最大的，首先总是人物。作家也每每在人物塑造上付出他们绝大部分精力。因此，作家就应该为我们这个伟大时代创造具有共产主义风格的人物而进行辛勤的劳动，用具有共产主义风格的鲜明形象来鼓舞千千万万人民奋勇前进。
    要在作品中创造具有共产主义风格的人物，是有充分的现实根据的。因为在我们伟大沸腾的现实生活当中，已经涌现了许许多多具有共产主义风格的新人，具有共产主义萌芽的新事物已经普遍存在。最近，我在四川武胜农村住了一个时期。武胜是四川的红旗县，它的变化是惊人的。县里有一个礼安公社，土质瘠薄不堪；特别是一二两个管区，地下到处是鹅卵石，正跟河坝一样。但是我们的英雄人民，却叫它铺山盖野地长出了绿油油的庄稼。他们之所以能够创造出这种奇迹，绝不仅仅为了增产粮食，而是和一个伟大的理想紧密联系着的。我在和群众的接触当中充分地感到了这一点。而这些为了迅速改变我国“一穷二白”的落后状况，为了使我国及早向共产主义社会过渡的英雄人民使我受到了极大的启发。
    想起这个县的广大群众的冲天干劲，我是有很多话想说的。当然，时间不许可我这样做；可是我还是忍不住要谈一谈我在烈面区参与过的一次评比竞赛。这个区有一个桥亭公社，因为短点苕藤，短点肥料，生产落后了一步，评比垮了。而那个高大健壮的烈面公社的党委书记，偏要向它挑战，而且鼓励其他几个公社扭住桥亭不放。可是末了，他又带头向桥亭提出保证：肥料没有，我们借给你们两千斤苕藤吧！明天早上来担。而且立刻走出人声沸腾的会场，打电话回社安排苕藤去了。正跟全国各地一样，这种富有共产主义协作精神的故事，在人民公社化后的四川农村当中，可以说是屡见不鲜的。
    文艺作品是党向人民群众进行社会主义、共产主义思想教育的有力武器，为了使它在广大群众中起到更大的教育和鼓舞作用，我们在创作中必须对我们所塑造的人物充分地理想化。当然，我们所说的理想化，是以现实生活为依据的，它同脱离现实的杜撰毫无共同之处。因为这些具有共产主义风格的新的人物，是在现实生活中存在的，他们的思想和风格，也是在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的复杂斗争中形成的。所谓使人物更加理想化，不过是概括现实生活中许多活人的共产主义品质，特别是强调活人性格中一些在未来将更为普遍存在的新的萌芽。即在概括现实生活的基础上加以提高。在《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中，当毛主席谈到自然形态和观念形态的文艺的区别时曾经指出，作为观念形态的文艺“应该比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想”。这个英明指示，毛主席是阐发得很透彻的，它应该成为我们大家对人物进行理想化共同遵循的原则。因为它是总结全部创作经验得出来的科学结论。
    我以为要做到毛主席对我们提出来的要求，首先必须具备丰富的生活经验，必须用党的观点和政策对这些生活经验进行深入的分析研究，为创作上的集中概括提供一个深厚可靠的基础。而更为重要的，还在于我们要能够高瞻远瞩，站在共产主义的思想高度来感受、表现我们伟大沸腾的现实生活，使作品渗透着鼓舞人心的革命的浪漫主义精神。最近一年以来，对于革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合这一创作方法，我是作过些考虑的，越来越感觉到革命的浪漫主义应该是主导的一面。因为每当我想起革命的浪漫主义的时候，我总同时想起马克思列宁主义的不断革命论，而不断革命论却是指导阶级斗争的战略思想。所以我想，如果从这一角度去考虑革命的浪漫主义问题，我们就更能自觉地深刻反映“一天等于二十年”的伟大沸腾的现实生活和广大群众的精神面貌，更能满腔热情地歌颂那些不断战胜困难、战胜形形色色的思想障碍、为新生活开辟道路的英雄人物，让广大读者跟作品中的人物一起奋勇前进。
    我们不少受到读者欢迎的作品，正是在反映现实斗争生活的深度和人物塑造上有了更大的鼓舞人的力量。譬如，《红旗》（梁斌）和《创业史》（柳青）和《红日》（吴强）这三部长篇，就都在不同的方面，不同的程度上体现了革命的浪漫主义精神，作者满怀热情地歌颂了那些为了集体利益和革命利益而奋不顾身的英雄人物。在短篇创作中，当大家读了《一个温暖的雪夜》（刘白羽）的时候，难道不会感到振奋，从而联想起全国劳动人民为一个伟大的理想而战斗的英雄气概？而当我想起那个平时疲沓不堪，在工作紧张时却又拄着棍子“健步如飞”的《我的第一个上级》（马烽），想起那个《在严重的时刻》（王汶石）把那些悲观失望的人们重新鼓动起来，一起投入新的战斗的公社党委书记的时候，我总不能不联想起那些我所认识的为了一个伟大理想而艰苦奋斗的农村干部，渴望把他们写出来。
    我以上提到的是部分专业作家的部分作品。就是工农兵业余作家的作品，在体现党和群众的要求上也有很大的成就。特别是大跃进以来出现的一批工农兵青年作者的作品。单拿四川来说，就有好几位工农兵业余作者写得不错。当然，对于他们说来，这仅仅是个开始。但是，当我想到那个在《春夜》（采风）里偷偷向一个寡妇学习针线、偷偷敲打郎头的半退休的老年工人的时候，我总非常激动。因为这个老年工人之所以决心要使自己在旧社会被鞭打残废了的手臂灵活起来，不是为了别的，而是为了争取回到他心爱的工作岗位上去，以便我们的国家能够在比十五年更短的时间内赶上英国。我也想起那种弥漫在《烧焊》（杜夫）场上的新的共产主义的风习。而那个在朝鲜战场上因为救护伤员而瞎了眼睛，后来又千辛万苦学会了按摩，耐心治疗病人的女护士，无论如何称得上我们这个社会的一枝《永不雕谢的花朵》（黄谋远）……
    有时，当一些青年朋友同我谈到怎样才能在创作上体现革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，特别是体现革命的浪漫主义精神的时候，我总老是想起那些教育了广大群众的革命斗争回忆录（可能因为这些作品比较容易说明问题）。而且从它们得到启示：作者自己必须首先是一个与群众同呼吸、共命运，为实现伟大革命理想不断进行斗争的无产阶级战士，才能真正解决问题。因为这些作品之所以不仅正确地描写了过去的革命斗争历史，同时还渗透着革命的乐观主义和革命的英雄主义精神的根本原因，正在这里。血管流出来的是血，水管流出来的只能是水。1931年左右，我曾经写过一个短篇，叫做《恐怖》，旨在揭露反动派的血腥罪行，而结果却流露了自己当时存在的消极情绪。我相信，我现在绝对不会写出这样的东西来的，而这篇三十年前的旧作却充分说明了：在创作问题上，总直接牵涉到作者本人的思想感情、精神状态和整个世界观的，一点也假不了。
    “文如其人”，这是一句大家都知道的成语。我觉得现在应该对这句成语赋予新的内容，新的解释。这就是：要想在创作上完满体现革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的精神，作者自己必须是一个充分具备共产主义风格的人。而1942年毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表以来的丰富经验证明，只要我们老老实实继续遵循毛主席的教导，认真学习马克思列宁主义，长期深入生活斗争，从行动到思想感情和群众打成一片，坚决地沿着为工农兵服务的方向前进，我们就能完全做到。
