    Developing "Wanbao Mountain"

    The Old Hunter's New Creation

    A wild boar burst out of the dense forest, stopped to sniff, and seeing no sign of danger, charged forward menacingly. Suddenly, a shotgun hidden in the bushes fired with a bang, and the wild boar collapsed with a squeal. Strangely, there was no hunter there; the shotgun was firing at its prey "automatically."…

    This "automatic" hunting gun is a new creation of Yang Yingsheng, an old hunter from Wen County.

    Yang Yingsheng lives in Jinjigou, Wen County, where the mountains are high, the gullies are deep, and the forests are dense. Black bears, wild boars, porcupines, wild goats, and other harmful animals appear frequently, endangering crops and the safety of people and livestock. Yang Yingsheng started hunting when he was just over ten years old, and now, after more than fifty years, he has developed superb marksmanship and never misses. In his hunting records carved with a knife on the door panel, not counting wild birds and small animals, he has killed a full seventy wild boars and more than one hundred and twenty wild goats.

    After the communization, the elderly Yang Yingsheng worked at a bee farm, spending a happy old age. However, this old man still has a strong interest in hunting.

    The "Hundred Fruit Orchard" Old Man

    Wudu County has a well-known "Hundred Fruit Orchard." In this colorful orchard, cherry trees are grafted with peaches, apricots, and apples, peach trees are grafted with apples and dates, pear trees are grafted with cherries and grapes, ... a mere thirty-eight kinds of fruit trees have been grafted into one hundred and eight kinds of fruit trees.

    This "Hundred Fruit Orchard" was created single-handedly by the gray-haired old man Zhang Shiqing. Everyone in the mountainous area knows about Zhang Shiqing. In the high and cold mountainous area, he used warm water to germinate seeds and intercropping methods to change the crops from one harvest per year to three harvests per year, establishing a banner of high yield in the mountainous area; at the same time, he also brought rice to the mountains. People call him "Michurin"!

    This peasant scientist has a wish: to let the mountain people eat fragrant and sweet fruits! Over the past few years, he has put in a lot of hard work for this. Once, during the peach ripening season, Zhang Shiqing was returning home by train from a meeting in Lanzhou. Passing through a famous peach-producing area along the Wei River, he saw the bright red peaches bending the branches. As soon as the train entered the station, he jumped off and went to the peach orchard to collect peach pits. By the time he returned to the station, the train had already left, but he still happily carried the peach pits and walked the rest of the long journey on foot. Over the years, he has tried every possible means to collect good varieties, and has carried out more than twenty hybridization experiments on fruit trees in order to cultivate new varieties. Now all the fruit trees in the orchard have been successfully grafted, and the early grafts have blossomed and borne fruit. When Zhang Shiqing works in the orchard, looking at the more than one hundred kinds of new fruit trees, he often sings the mountain songs he composed himself:

    The hundred fruit orchard is full of fragrance,
    A hundred fruits, a hundred flavors, all sweet,
    Eating the fruit is like eating honey,
    In my heart, I remember the Communist Party!

    Deep Mountain Collector

    Under the slogan of "Seeking Treasures from Wild Plants," Wang Zhengrui, a worker from the Wudu County Non-Staple Food Processing Factory, set off for the deep mountains with several apprentices, carrying hoes and baskets on their backs. In the mountains, he found a large number of wild green onions growing. He peeled off the onion root skin and tasted it, finding it slightly sweet. He thought, "Hey! It would be great if we could extract sugar from it!" So he collected a basketful and brought it back for experiments. He peeled off the onion root skin and steamed it in a pot, then added water to boil it. As a result, he boiled out some black, sweet, and sticky liquid. After repeated research and experiments with everyone, plus some barley malt, the liquid changed from black to yellow and shiny, becoming syrup. Later, the yield of syrup was increased from eighteen catties to twenty-five catties per hundred catties of green onions. After adopting this raw material, the Wudu County Non-Staple Food Processing Factory was fully able to meet the factory's monthly requirement of more than one thousand catties of syrup for making pastries. This expanded the factory's production capacity and ensured market supply. (Attached picture)

    开发“万宝山”的人们
    老猎手的新创造
    从密茂的森林中钻出一头野猪，它停下来嗅了嗅，并没有什么危险的征候，于是气势汹汹地冲向前。突然，掩藏在树丛中的一支火枪砰然发射，野猪狂嗥着应声倒地。奇怪的是，那儿并没有什么猎人，火枪完全是在“自动”向猎物射击。……
    这种“自动化”的猎枪，是文县老猎手杨迎升的新创造。
    杨迎升居住的文县锦鸡沟，山大沟深，森林密布，黑熊、野猪、刺猪、野山羊等害兽出没无常，危害庄稼和人畜安全。杨迎升从十多岁就开始打猎，到现在已五十多年，练就的一手神枪，百发百中。他在门扇上用刀刻划的猎获记录中，野鸟小兽不算，只野猪就打死整整七十头，野山羊一百二十多头。
    公社化以后，杨迎升老人在养蜂场工作，度着幸福的晚年。可是这位老人对打猎还有着浓厚的兴趣。
    “百果园”老人
    武都县有一个远近闻名的“百果园”。在这个万紫千红的果园里，樱桃树上接的是桃、杏和苹果，桃树上接的是苹果和枣，梨树上接的是樱桃和葡萄，……仅仅三十八种果树已嫁接成一百零八种果树了。
    这个“百果园”是鬓发斑白的老人张世清一手搞起来的。提起张世清，山区的人们没有不知道的。他在高寒的山区，用温水催芽和间作套种的方法，使庄稼由每年一熟变为每年三熟，树立了山区高产旗帜；同时还把水稻搬上了山。人们都称他为“米丘林”！
    这位农民科学家有一个愿望：让山里人吃上又香又甜的水果！几年来，他为此付出了许多辛勤的劳动。一次，在桃子成熟的季节，张世清从兰州开会后坐火车回家，途经渭河沿岸一个著名产桃区时，望见红艳艳的大桃压弯了果枝。列车一进站，他就跳下车，赶到桃园拾桃核。等他回到车站时，列车早就开走了，他仍满心喜悦地背着桃核徒步走完余下的一段很长的路程。几年来，他就这样千方百计地收集良种，为了培育新品种，对果树进行了二十几次杂交试验。现在果园的果树已全部接活，早接的已开花结果。张世清在果园劳动时，望着一百多种新果树，常常唱着自己编的山歌：
    百果园里百花香，
    百果百味样样甜，
    吃着果儿赛吃蜜，
    心里记着共产党！
    深山采集者
    在“向野生植物要宝”的口号下，武都县副食品加工厂工人王正瑞带着几个徒工，扛着锄头、背上背斗向深山出发。在山里，他发现生长着大量的野绿葱，剥开葱根皮尝尝略有甜味，他想：“嘿！要是能熬出糖来多好呢！”于是采集了一背斗拿回来作试验。他把葱根皮剥掉放在锅里蒸，然后加水熬，结果熬出一些黑色味甜的粘性液体。经过他和大家一起，多次反复研究试验，再加上一些大麦芽，液体就由黑变黄发亮，成为糖稀了。后来，每百斤绿葱由出糖稀十八斤提高到二十五斤。武都县副食品加工厂采用这种原料后，完全满足了每月作糕点所需的一千多斤糖稀的要求。从而扩大了全厂的生产能力，保证了市场供应。（附图片）
