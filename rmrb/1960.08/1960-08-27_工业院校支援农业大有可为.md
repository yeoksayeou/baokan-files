Industrial Colleges Supporting Agriculture Has Great Potential
Lü Xuepo, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Harbin Institute of Technology Committee

Currently, a vigorous mass movement to support agriculture is sweeping the nation. Supporting agriculture is an important task for all sectors, and it is also the inescapable responsibility of industrial colleges.

For industrial colleges, supporting agriculture is an important aspect of implementing the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor." Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture and rapidly improving the level of rural productivity are extremely important tasks in socialist construction. If industrial colleges are to truly "serve proletarian politics," they must not stand aloof from the mass movement to support agriculture, but must plunge into this torrent of activity and contribute their share of strength. At the same time, supporting agricultural production also provides new content for combining education with productive labor, and opens up new horizons for teachers and students to engage in productive labor. Therefore, industrial colleges must comprehensively implement the Party's education policy and do everything possible to support agriculture.

Some people think that industrial colleges are not like factories, which can support rural areas with a large number of mechanical and electrical equipment; nor are they like agricultural colleges, which can provide technical guidance to farmers and help them carry out scientific research. Industrial colleges participating in the technical revolution of factories are still a good "match," but supporting agriculture is fundamentally "mismatched."

Is this really the case? Certainly not.

Based on the work done by Harbin Institute of Technology in this area over the past two years, industrial colleges not only have an unshirkable duty to support agriculture, but also have great potential to do so. There are many things that industrial colleges can do to support agriculture.

First, conduct scientific research and design to meet the needs of agricultural technology transformation. In the process of realizing agricultural mechanization, electrification, water conservancy, and running industries for the communes, industry will inevitably face a large number of technical requirements. Industrial colleges can select projects from these and conduct scientific research. In the past two years, more than 500 teachers and more than 820 students from ten majors in our school have participated in scientific research in this area. For example, in order to develop county and commune mechanical industries in rural areas in a faster, better, and more economical way, a set of machine tools suitable for the characteristics of rural areas in our country is needed. This is a scientific research work of great significance to the national economy. In the spring of last year, we sent more than 20 teachers and students from the machine tool major to five counties in Heilongjiang Province to conduct an in-depth investigation of the needs of county and commune industrial machine tools. They also visited the "Exhibition of Indigenous Equipment" in Beijing and summarized the experience of 800 indigenous machine tools created by workers and peasants across the country during the Great Leap Forward, designing a complete set of (25 units) metal cutting machine tools for rural people's communes. These machine tools are ingeniously structured, inexpensive, widely adaptable, and relatively easy to master technically. For example, most rural areas in our country are currently suitable for establishing small-scale power stations, but the head of small rivers is generally low. Therefore, how to suit this characteristic and fully utilize these decentralized water conservancy resources is an important issue related to the development speed of water conservancy and power in rural areas in our country. The hydraulic machinery major of our school studied this requirement and designed a series of small tubular turbines. They can not only use a lower head to generate electricity, but also have a simple structure and are easy to install. They can be manufactured with cast iron and do not require any steel, saving about half of the metal compared to general small turbines. In the process of agricultural technology transformation, there are many technical problems that need to be studied by industrial colleges, and many of these problems have never been solved or even touched upon by predecessors. Industrial colleges have a vast world to play their role here.

Second, train technical personnel for rural areas. Since there was almost no industry in rural areas in our country in the past, there is a particular lack of industrial technical personnel. Industrial colleges can just bring their strengths to bear in solving this problem. Teachers and students of our school's electrical power major and hydraulic machinery major have run three-month hydropower training courses for various counties in Heilongjiang Province. After graduating and returning to their respective regions, many trainees have become the backbone of rural electrification. The electrical measurement major has held indigenous electricity meter training courses, training technical cadres who can manufacture indigenous electricity meters for the whole country. The electrical appliance major also sent people thousands of miles away to Xingtai County, Hebei Province, to impart knowledge of indigenous electrical appliances. In addition, many teachers and students who went to rural areas to conduct scientific research opened classes for farmers in the communes and trained a large number of technical personnel for them.

Third, in combination with professional characteristics, prepare plans for rural areas. Under the leadership of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and local Party committees, the power economics major of our school conducted in-depth investigations and research, and prepared rural electrification plans for Ning'an County in Heilongjiang Province, Hongdong County in Shanxi Province, and Yongchun County in Fujian Province. They also carried out research and experiments on the comprehensive utilization of rural power resources. Teachers and students of the machine manufacturing enterprise organization and planning major conducted investigations and research on commune-run industries in several people's communes in Shuangcheng, Shangzhi, and Nehe counties. Under the leadership of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, they helped counties and communes formulate plans for developing commune industries.

Fourth, use the labor achievements of the school's teachers, students, and staff to provide material support to rural areas. Since implementing the Party's education policy, colleges and universities across the country have established many factories and produced many products, some of which are urgently needed by rural areas. At the same time, schools can also specially produce a batch of products for rural needs. In the past two years, our school has supported rural areas with more than 250 sets of mechanical and electrical equipment such as electric motors, transformers, lightning arresters, diesel engines, bench drills, and brick making machines. These are all the labor achievements of teachers, students, and staff in the process of implementing the Party's education policy.

In addition, combined with labor training, going to the countryside to participate in agricultural production labor and various rural construction projects, and building one's own non-staple food production bases can also reduce the burden on rural areas. Every year, our school organizes a large number of teachers and students to participate in production labor such as drought resistance, rush planting, rush hoeing, rush harvesting, and deep plowing in the suburbs of the city during the busy farming season. Since last winter, our school has been sending more than 100 teachers and cadres every month to participate in the canal construction project of the Wanjiaguan Irrigation District in the suburbs of Harbin City, and has now carried out more than 20,000 workdays. Teachers and students of power economics and hydraulic machinery majors who went to the countryside for scientific research participated in the construction projects of several hydropower stations in Ning'an County. Students majoring in industrial enterprise electrification erected 11 kilometers of high-voltage lines for the suburbs of Harbin City. We also organize teachers and students from various departments to build farms and pastures, grow vegetables and raise pigs, and gradually solve the problem of non-staple food supply self-reliantly in combination with labor training. This is also a kind of indirect support for agriculture.

Supporting agricultural production has brought a profound impact on the school and has greatly promoted all aspects of the school's work.

Supporting agriculture has trained people, and teachers and students have undergone great changes in their thoughts and feelings. In the long run, this is of great significance for eliminating the differences between manual and mental labor and eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas. In the past, many teachers and students were "weak in the limbs and unable to distinguish the five grains" and only knew a little about agriculture from newspapers. After personally going to the front line of agricultural production, they have new knowledge and feelings. The soaring enthusiasm shown by the masses of peasants under the shining of the Party's general line for socialist construction in order to get rid of the "poor and blank" state has greatly inspired teachers and students and has become a force to urge themselves to move forward. A female student in the engineering economics department used to have ideological baggage, made trouble, and suffered from neurasthenia. After going to the countryside, she was deeply educated by the peasants in the commune's spirit of loving labor and loving Chairman Mao. Through working and living together with the peasants, she became cheerful, mentally happy, and her neurasthenia quickly improved. Her enthusiasm is also getting stronger and stronger. Some people who once thought that college teachers and students participating in agricultural production labor was a "waste of youth" were greatly infected by the hardworking and simple peasants in labor and truly realized that: "Without agricultural production, no one can live." They were determined to "be good sons of the working people for the rest of their lives."

Supporting agricultural production helps to combine theory with practice and enables some majors to find new directions for scientific research. In the past, some people in scientific research often only paid attention to researching high, sophisticated, and cutting-edge projects, while paying insufficient attention to or turning a blind eye to the problems that the broad masses of people urgently needed to solve, or even thought that these problems were too "rustic" and unworthy of attention. After a series of work to support agricultural production, the view is different. The machine tool major has designated simple machine tools as one of the long-term scientific research directions, and has creatively designed small modular machine tools for rural use on the original basis. When teachers and students of the power economics major summarized the research work done in rural electrification, they said: "What is the 'cutting edge' of our major? For a long time, we could not find a clear answer. Now we see that rural electrification is a problem that 500 million peasants urgently demand to solve, and realizing rural electrification under the conditions of people's communes is a new problem that has never been encountered since ancient times. If we can find out the road to rural electrification in our country from practice and raise it to the level of theory, isn't this the cutting edge of our major?" The situation of other related majors is also the same. The simpler the method, the more skillfully the urgent and complex problems are solved, the higher the level of this scientific research is. The fact is also true, now the simple machine tools designed by the machine tool major have all been adopted by the First Ministry of Machinery Industry, produced in machine tool factories all over the country, and included in the national machine tool model spectrum. Among them, the bench drill was also sent to the Leipzig International Fair for exhibition.

The gains made by teachers and students in ideological awareness and scientific level are also naturally reflected in the improvement of teaching quality. In the "Introduction to Machine Tools" course, the research results of their design of simple machine tools and modular machine tools were included in the teaching content, adding a chapter on modular machine tools and simple machine tools. The students also compiled a teaching reference book of about 200,000 words under the guidance of the teacher. When hydraulic machinery teachers taught turbine installation in the past, they could only talk about large and foreign turbines, but this year they added content about small turbine installation based on the experience gained in helping rural areas build hydropower stations. In order to create "indigenous" electrical appliances needed by rural areas, students majoring in electrical appliances have conducted detailed research on the performance and function of each component of "foreign" electrical appliances and found substitute materials. This enables them to master the knowledge of their profession proficiently, not only to be able to write and speak, but also to be able to make them by hand. Students majoring in electrical measurement, electrical appliances, and hydraulic machinery have also compiled their research results into books, which have been published by publishing houses such as the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power.

In summary, supporting agricultural production is not only an unshirkable duty for industrial colleges, but also has great potential; it not only promotes agricultural technology transformation, but also promotes teaching reform; it is both beneficial to being red and being expert.

In order to advance the work of supporting agricultural production to a new stage, we believe that the following issues need to be resolved.

First of all, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party, unify our understanding, regard supporting agriculture as an important task within our own responsibilities, and include it in the school's work plan. The Party organization of our school has constantly fought against the idea of undervaluing support for agriculture, and at the fourth enlarged meeting of the school Party committee held this spring, it listed the issue of supporting agriculture in realizing technological transformation as the first aspect of the ten aspects of key scientific research topics in our school, and this work is directly led by a Party committee secretary. The relevant majors have all formulated their own scientific research plans to support agriculture in realizing technological transformation in accordance with this decision of the Party committee.

Secondly, it is necessary to fix points for pairing, combine points and areas, comprehensively contact, and provide support in many ways. In the past, the areas supported by our school covered the whole country, and many of the works done should be affirmed. However, the supported areas are wider and the work is more "scattered," which often makes it difficult to carry out the support work in a planned way, and it is difficult to summarize a complete set of experience. Therefore, we have recently decided to fix points for pairing with Xin'an People's Commune in Ning'an County, Heilongjiang Province, and Wujiazi People's Commune in Shuangcheng County, to provide comprehensive support from the aspects of technology, culture, and material equipment respectively, and to prepare to build an agricultural modernization experimental station as a base for researching and experimenting with new agricultural technologies, and then summarize the experience from here and promote it to various places. This method of combining points and areas will achieve better results.

Finally, it is necessary to fight in large groups, establish institutions, and unify forces. Because the work of agricultural technology transformation involves many majors and needs to be carried out for a long time, if it is carried out in a decentralized manner, it will inevitably be counterproductive. Therefore, our school has recently established an Agricultural Modernization Research Office, equipped with full-time researchers and staff, to uniformly lead, organize, and arrange the research work in this area throughout the school.

Although our school has done some work in supporting agriculture, there is still a distance from the requirements of the Party and the people. We are determined not to be arrogant or impetuous, learn from the experience of advanced units with an open mind, and improve the work of the school in supporting agricultural production to a new level.

    工业院校支援农业大有可为
    中共哈尔滨工业大学委员会副书记　吕学坡
    现在，全国各地掀起了轰轰烈烈的支援农业的群众运动。支援农业是各行各业的重要任务，也是工业院校义不容辞的责任。
    对于工业院校来说，支援农业是贯彻执行党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”方针的一个重要方面。农业是国民经济的基础。加速实现农业技术改造，迅速提高农村生产力水平，是社会主义建设中的一项极为重要的任务。工业院校要真正做到使“教育为无产阶级政治服务”，就决不能置身于支援农业的群众运动之外，而必须投身于这一运动的洪流中，贡献出自己的一分力量。同时，支援农业生产也为实现教育与生产劳动相结合提供了新的内容，为师生进行生产劳动开辟了新的天地。因此，工业院校要全面地贯彻执行党的教育方针，就必须尽自己所能，千方百计地支援农业。
    有人认为，工业院校不比工厂，可以支援农村大批机电设备；也不比农业院校，可以做农民的技术指导，可以帮助农民开展科学研究。工业院校参加工厂的技术革命还“门当户对”，支援农业则根本“对不上口径”。
    难道事情果真是这样吗？肯定不是。
    根据哈尔滨工业大学近两年来在这方面所做的工作看来，工业院校支援农业不仅义不容辞，而且大有可为。工业院校在支援农业方面能做的工作是很多的。
    第一，适应农业技术改造需要，进行科学研究和设计。实现农业机械化、电气化、水利化和为公社办工业的过程中，必然会对工业提出大量的技术要求，工业院校就正好可以从中选定项目，进行科学研究。两年来，我校就有十个专业的五百余名教师、八百二十余名学生参加了这方面的科学研究工作。例如，为了多快好省地发展农村县社机械工业，就需要一套适合我国农村特点的机床，这是一项对国民经济有巨大意义的科学研究工作。在去年春季，我们就派出了机床专业的二十余名师生，深入到黑龙江省的五个县，对县社工业机床的需要进行了深入的调查，并到北京参观了“土设备展览会”，总结了全国工农群众在大跃进中创造出的八百台土机床的经验，设计出了一整套
  （二十五台）农村人民公社用的金属切削机床。这些机床结构灵巧，造价低廉，适应性广，技术也比较容易掌握。又如，我国农村目前大都适于建立小型电站，而一般小河落差却较低。因此，怎样适合这种特点，充分利用这些分散的水利资源，是一个关系着我国农村水利电力发展速度的重要问题。我校水力机械专业就研究了这种要求，设计出一系列的小型贯流式水轮机。它们不仅可以利用较低的落差发电，而且结构简单，安装方便，可用铸铁制造，不用一点钢材，比起一般小型水轮机来，可以节省金属一半左右。在农业技术改造过程中，需要工业院校研究的技术问题很多，而且其中不少问题都是前人根本没有解决过，甚至根本没有涉及到的。工业院校在这里有着发挥作用的广阔天地。
    第二，为农村培训技术人材。由于过去我国农村几乎没有什么工业，工业技术人材特别缺乏，工业院校在解决这一问题上正好可以发挥出自己的力量。我校电力专业与水力机械专业师生为黑龙江省各县开办过为期三月的水电训练班，学员毕业回到各地后，很多都成了农村电气化的骨干力量。电测专业举办过土电表训练班，为全国培养了能制造土电表的技术干部。电器专业还派人到数千里以外的河北省邢台县传授土电器的知识。此外，还有许多到农村进行科学研究工作的师生，在公社为农民开班讲课，为农民培养了大批的技术力量。
    第三，结合专业特点，为农村编制规划。我校动力经济专业在中央农业部和各地党委的领导下，经过深入调查研究，为黑龙江省宁安县、山西省洪洞县和福建省永春县等地编制出了农村电气化规划，并开展了农村动力资源综合利用的研究和试验。机器制造企业组织与计划专业的师生在双城、尚志和讷河等县的几个人民公社进行公社办工业的调查研究，在中共黑龙江省委农村工作部的领导下，帮助县社制定了发展公社工业的规划。
    第四，以学校师生职工的劳动成果，对农村进行物质支援。在贯彻执行党的教育方针以来，各地院校都办了许多工厂，生产了不少产品，其中有些产品正是农村所迫切需要的。同时，学校还可以专门针对农村需要生产一批产品。两年来，我校共支援了农村电动机、变压器、避雷器、柴油机、台钻和制砖机等二百五十余台机电设备，这些都是师生职工在贯彻执行党的教育方针过程中的劳动成果。
    此外，结合劳动锻炼，下乡参加农业生产劳动和农村各种建设工程，并自建副食品生产基地，还可以减轻农村的负担。我校每年都在农忙时期，组织大批师生参加市郊的抗旱、抢种、抢铲、抢收和深翻地等生产劳动。去冬以来，我校每月都派出百余名教师、干部参加哈尔滨市郊万家灌区的水渠建设工程，现已进行了两万多个劳动日。动力经济、水力机械专业下乡进行科学研究的师生，参加了宁安县数处水电站的建站工程。工业企业电气化专业的同学，为哈尔滨市郊架设了十一华里的高压线。我们还组织各系师生，结合劳动锻炼，自建农场、牧场，种菜养猪，逐步自力更生地解决副食供应问题。这也是对农业的一种间接的支援。
    支援农业生产给学校带来了深刻的影响，对学校各方面工作都有很大的推动作用。
    支援农业锻炼了人，师生在思想感情上发生了很大变化。从长远看来，这对消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别，消灭城市和乡村的差别，都具有重大意义。过去，有不少教师和学生都是“四体不勤，五谷不分”的白面书生，只是从报纸上知道一点农业的情况。在亲自到了农业生产前线之后，他们有了新的认识和感受。农民群众在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，为摆脱“一穷二白”的面貌所表现出的冲天干劲，给师生们以极大的鼓舞，并成了督促自己前进的力量。工程经济系有个女学生过去有思想包袱，闹情绪，得了神经衰弱症。下乡后，公社农民那种热爱劳动、热爱毛主席的精神，使她受到了深刻的教育。通过与农民的共同劳动，共同生活，思想开朗了，精神愉快了，神经衰弱症很快就好了。干劲也越来越足了。有些曾经认为大学师生参加农业生产劳动是“浪费青春”的人，在劳动中受到勤劳质朴的农民的很大感染，真正地意识到：“离开农业生产，谁也没法生活”。他们下决心“一辈子做劳动人民的好儿子”。
    支援农业生产有助于理论与实际结合，使有些专业找到了新的科学研究方向。过去有些人在科学研究方面，往往只注意研究高、精、尖的项目，而对广大人民迫切需要解决的问题则注意不够或熟视无睹，甚至认为这些问题太“土”而不屑一顾。经过一系列的支援农业生产的工作，看法就不同了。机床专业已把简式机床定为长期进行研究的科学研究方向之一，并在原来的基础上创造性地设计出了农村用的小型积木式机床。动力经济专业的师生在总结农村电气化方面所做的研究工作时说：“什么是我们专业的‘尖端’？长期以来，我们找不到明确的答案。现在我们看到农村电气化是五亿农民迫切要求解决的问题，而在人民公社化的条件下实现农村电气化是亘古以来从未遇到过的新问题。如果我们能从实际中摸出我国农村电气化的道路，并把它上升到理论上来，这不正是我们专业的尖端吗？”其他有关专业的情况也是如此。越是用简单的办法，巧妙地解决迫切的复杂的问题，这项科学研究的水平越高。事实也正是如此，现在机床专业设计的一套简式机床已全部为第一机械工业部采用，在全国各地机床厂生产，并被列入国家机床型谱，其中的台钻还被送往来比锡国际博览会展出。
    师生们在思想觉悟和科学水平方面的收获，也很自然地反映到教学质量的提高上。在“机床概论”的课程中，把他们设计简式机床和积木式机床的研究成果，列入了讲授内容，增加了积木式机床与简式机床一章，学生们还在教师的指导下编写了一部约二十万字的教学参考书。水力机械专业教师在讲水轮机安装时，过去只能讲大的、洋的，但是今年他们根据在帮助农村建水电站中得到的经验，又补充了关于小型水轮机安装的内容。电器专业的学生为了创造农村需要的“土”电器，就把有关“洋”电器的每个部件的性能、作用，进行了详细的研究，找出了代用材料。这就使他们熟练地掌握了本行知识，不但能动笔、动口，而且能动手制造。电测、电器和水力机械等专业的学生，还把他们的研究成果编写成册，由水利电力等出版社出版。
    综上所述，支援农业生产对工业院校来说不仅义不容辞，而且大有可为；不仅促进了农业技术改造，而且推动了教学改革工作；既有利于红，又有利于专。
    为了把支援农业生产的工作推进到新的阶段，我们认为需要解决以下几个问题。
    首先要加强党的领导，统一认识，把支援农业作为自己分内的重要任务，列入学校的工作计划。我校党组织曾经不断地和轻视支援农业的思想进行过斗争，并在今春举行的校党委第四次扩大会议上，把支援农业实现技术改造的课题，列入我校重点科学研究题目十个方面中的第一方面，并由一位党委书记直接领导这项工作。有关专业都按照党委这一决定，制定了自己支援农业实现技术改造的科学研究计划。
    其次，要定点挂钩，点面结合，全面联系，多方支援。我校过去支援的地区遍及全国，做的许多工作都是应该肯定的。但是支援的面较宽，工作较“散”，这就往往使支援工作不便有计划地进行，很难总结出成套的经验来。因此，我们在最近决定与黑龙江省宁安县新安人民公社、双城县的五家子人民公社，定点挂钩，分别从技术、文化和物质设备等方面进行全面支援，并筹建农业现代化试验站，作为研究、试验农业新技术的基地，再由这里总结出经验向各地推广，这样点面结合的办法，将会收到更好的效果。
    最后，要大兵团作战，建立机构，统一力量。由于农业技术改造工作牵涉到许多专业，而且需要长期进行下去，如果分散进行必然事倍功半，因此，我校在最近成立了农业现代化研究室，配备了专职研究人员和工作人员，以统一领导、组织和安排全校在这方面的研究工作。
    我们学校虽然在支援农业方面做了一些工作，但是比起党和人民的要求来，还有一段距离。我们决心不骄不躁，虚心学习先进单位的经验，把学校支援农业生产的工作，提高到新的水平。
