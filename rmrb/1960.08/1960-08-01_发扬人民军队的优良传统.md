	Carry Forward the Fine Traditions of the People's Army, The Red Army Spirit is Passed Down Through Generations
	The Red Army Regiment was formed in eastern Hubei in 1928 by forty-eight insurgent peasants armed with spears and broadswords. Since then, they have fought north and south, braving countless dangers, and made immortal contributions to the revolutionary cause.
	Some of the old Red Army Regiment veterans have sacrificed their lives, while others have left the unit to take on higher positions. However, the fine traditions they left behind continue to flourish and are passed down through generations. Here, from the regiment down to the company level, they have written their heroic and skillful combat, the unity of officers and soldiers, and other fine traditions into history. They display award banners, prizes, and other items in the exhibition room. Every holiday, when new recruits arrive at the company, or when accepting an important mission, they conduct a traditional education for the soldiers to promote and carry forward these traditions.
	In this regiment, whenever the Party announces a new policy or resolution, leading cadres vigorously publicize it to the troops until all soldiers thoroughly understand it. When the Party Central Committee announced the resolution on several issues concerning the people's communes in 1958, they organized officers and soldiers to study it while also sending people to work, visit, and learn in the communes. Later, they established ties with the communes, inviting commune cadres to give reports and sending cadres and soldiers to study. The soldiers said: "The commune's face is changing day by day, and our awareness is increasing step by step."
	The Red Army Regiment's heroic and tenacious fighting spirit is also maintained and carried forward in the new generation. In a combat exercise, the troops encountered torrential rain as soon as they set out, and the roads were muddy and difficult to navigate. When the troops switched from the main road to a mountain path, the livestock could not move. The soldiers carried cannons and equipment on their backs and continued to advance. After a night march, the exercise began at dawn the next day, and the soldiers were still energetic and brave.
	Close relations between officers and soldiers and among comrades is an old tradition of the Red Army Regiment. Today, soldiers also write poems saying: "Peach blossoms bloom red in March, arriving at the company is like arriving home; comrades are like brothers, and leaders are better than parents." During a march, Regiment Commander Niu saw a soldier who had fallen behind due to sudden illness and immediately dismounted to help him up. Fearing that the livestock might be unruly and throw off the sick soldier, he led the horse with one hand and supported the sick soldier with the other until he reached the camp. In the company, it has become a habit for cadres to cover soldiers with blankets and mend their clothes. Every year when new recruits enlist, retiring veterans leave a gift—a sewing kit—so that they can sew and mend. (Fang Dianzhong, Duan Wenhui)

	Everyone Learns from the "Good Eighth Company"
	"Residing in the bustling city, yet remaining untainted." This is how people praise the Eighth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
	The Eighth Company has lived in a high-rise building on Nanjing Road since shortly after the liberation of Shanghai, and they are not moved by the dazzling and prosperous life. For more than a decade, they have remained as simple and hardworking as they were during the war years, maintaining and carrying forward the glorious traditions of the People's Army.
	The Eighth Company's office often has stacks of letters from all over the country on the desk. The company's honor room is constantly visited by people. In the past six months, they have been invited to give reports to more than 300 organizations, factories, and schools, with tens of thousands of listeners. After learning about the "Good Eighth Company's" deeds of hard work and simplicity, they all use the standards of the Eighth Company to demand of themselves.
	At the China Record Factory, after the workers learned about the deeds of the "Good Eighth Company," they repeatedly discussed: "In the past, we often used useful scraps of wood as fuel or threw them into the trash, thinking these were insignificant things. But the Eighth Company's soldiers used a washbasin for ten years and still repaired and used it. Is this a small thing?" As a result, workers in the carpentry workshop went to the kitchen to retrieve waste materials, repaired them, and made a hundred new motor boards.
	After the workers of the Shanghai Boiler Factory read the report "The Good Eighth Company with a Frugal Style," many people made plans for thrifty housekeeping. Housewife Xia Meiying mended her eldest son's cotton-padded jacket, which he had worn for eight or nine years, and gave it to her second son to wear. She said: "The soldiers of the Good Eighth Company wear a shirt with thirty-eight patches, shouldn't we be more careful and calculating?"
	The deeds of the "Good Eighth Company" are like a warm spring breeze, blowing on the flowers of the motherland—the children. A squadron of the Young Pioneers of the No. 2 Primary School for Railway Workers' Children in Changsha, thousands of miles away from Shanghai, originally had poor discipline. Since launching the activity of "Learning from the Good Eighth Company and Welcoming the Congress of Young Pioneers," the whole squadron has undergone great changes and won the title of "Five-Good" squadron in Changsha. After launching a upsurge in learning from the "Good Eighth Company," Shanghai Jianchun Girls' Middle School changed their past habits of being lax in life and spending money recklessly, and promoted learning. Not long ago, they also came to the Eighth Company to report their excellent academic achievements. (Chen Xiangdong, Hu Ruisong)

	Heroic Sailors
	A certain naval boat squadron of the Chinese People's Liberation Army heard a message: a small fishing boat fishing in shallow waters was suddenly hit by a violent storm and swept away by the waves. Upon hearing the news, the sailors on a certain gunboat immediately set sail. At this time, there was a strong gale and a torrential downpour at sea. The gunboat was sometimes lifted by the crest of a wave, and sometimes plunged into a deep trough. Taking advantage of the few dozen seconds each time the boat was at the crest of the wave, the sailors carefully searched the surface of the sea.
	The dark clouds were getting lower and lower. It was already 6:30 in the afternoon, and the fishing boat had not been found yet. The sailors were all secretly anxious. Suddenly, an exciting voice came from the front deck: "A black object found twenty degrees to port!" Long Sanyang, the mine squad leader in charge of lookout on the rear deck, also saw the target that was flickering in the waves at this moment. He immediately picked up the cable, took the lifebuoy, and stood on the railing. The target quickly approached and was indeed a small fishing boat. The three people on the boat held up bamboo hats and waved vigorously at the sailors. The gunboat quickly approached the fishing boat. Long Sanyang threw the cable to the fishing boat, but once, twice, the fishermen failed to catch it. Seeing another cross wave coming, the gunboat was sure to smash the fishing boat with this wave, and the sailors were anxious and sweating profusely. At this moment, Long Sanyang stepped over the railing, followed the force of the wave, jumped over several meters of water, and jumped onto the small boat, using his hands and shoulders to desperately hold the incoming gunboat. The sailors on the gunboat also quickly put on the bumpers. In this way, the danger of the boat sinking and people dying was avoided.
	It turned out that when the three fishermen went out to sea to fish at dawn, it was a warm and sunny day, and they were only wearing a single layer of clothing. Who would have thought that at noon, the wind suddenly changed direction, and black clouds rose from the west, followed immediately by thunder, lightning, wind, and rain. The boat awning was blown away by the wind, and the firewood for heating and cooking was soaked in water. They had been fighting the wind and waves in the cold and hunger for seven hours, and now they were exhausted and their hands and feet were frozen. Before the gunboat arrived, they could still fight against death with their last bit of strength, but now that they saw the sailors had arrived and knew they were "saved," they were no longer able to move. They looked at Long Sanyang jumping onto the fishing boat fearlessly, and couldn't help but their eyes getting hot and tears welling up. Long Sanyang also excitedly hugged them tightly, and taking advantage of the moment when the fishing boat was lifted by the crest of the wave, lifted them up and sent them over to the gunboat. The lives of the three fishermen were thus snatched back from the storm. (Zhou Shiyuan)

    发扬人民军队的优良传统	红军作风代代相传
    红军团是1928年由四十八个起义农民拿着长矛、大刀在鄂东成立的。从那时起，南征北战，出生入死，为革命事业作出不朽的贡献。
    红军团的老战士有的已经献出了生命，有的离开这支部队，担任更高的职务。可是他们留下的优良作风却在继续开花结果，代代相传着。这里，从团到连都把自己英勇善战、官兵一致等优良作风写成历史，把奖旗、奖品等陈列在展览室里，每当节日，新兵到连和接受一次重要任务，都要向士兵进行一次传统教育，使其发扬光大。
    在这个团，领导干部每当党公布一项新政策、新决议，都要在部队大张旗鼓地宣传，一直到全体士兵彻底领会为止。1958年党中央公布关于人民公社几个问题的决议时，他们一面组织官兵学习，一面派人到公社劳动、参观、访问。以后又与公社挂了钩，请公社干部来做报告，派干部、战士去学习。战士们说：公社面貌日日新，我们的觉悟步步高。红军团英勇顽强的战斗作风，也在新一代中保持和发扬着。在一次战斗演习中，部队一出发就遇到倾盆大雨，道路泥泞难行。部队由大道转上山间小路时，牲口不能走了，战士把火炮、装具背到自己身上继续前进。夜行军之后，第二天拂晓开始演习，战士们依然生龙活虎，勇敢无比。
    官兵、战友亲密无间是红军团的老传统。今天，战士们也写诗说：“三月毛桃开红花，到了连队如到家；战友好似亲兄弟，首长胜过亲爹妈。”在一次行军中，牛团长看到一个战士因突然生病掉队，立即下马把他扶上去。怕牲口调皮摔下病号，他一手牵马，一手扶病号，一直把病号送到宿营地。在连队里，干部为战士盖被子、补衣服也都成了习惯。每年新兵入伍，退伍的老战士都要留下一件礼物——针线包，好让他们缝缝补补。　　　　（房殿仲　段文慧）	人人学习“好八连”
    “身居闹市、一尘不染”。这是人们对中国人民解放军某部八连的赞语。
    八连，从上海解放不久，就住在南京路上一座高楼大厦里，五光十采的繁华生活，不为他们所动。十多年来，他们仍然像战争年代一样艰苦朴素、克勤克俭，保持和发扬着人民军队的光荣传统。
    八连连部的办公室，桌上经常放着一叠叠来自全国各地的信件。连的荣誉室，参观访问的人更是络绎不断。半年来，请他们做报告的有三百多个机关、工厂、学校，听众数以万计。他们学了八连的艰苦朴素的事迹以后，都用八连的标准来要求自己。在中国唱片厂，工人们学习了“好八连”的事迹以后，一遍又一遍地谈论：“过去我们常把有用的零碎木材当燃料，或者送进垃圾箱，认为这是无所谓的小事情。可是八连的战士们一只脸盆用了十年，还在修修补补用哩，这是小事吗？”于是，木工车间的工人跑到伙房把废料拿出来，修修弄弄，制出了一百只新的马达板。上海锅炉厂工人看了“勤俭成风的好八连”的报道，许多人作出了勤俭持家的计划。家庭妇女夏梅英，把大儿子穿了八九年的棉袄，又缝缝补补，给她的二儿子穿，她说：“好八连的战士，一件衬衣补了三十八个补钉还在穿，我们不是更应该精打细算吗？”
    “好八连”的事迹，像和暖的春风一样，吹拂了祖国的花朵——少年儿童们。远离上海数千里的长沙铁路职工子弟第二小学少先队一个中队原来纪律不大好，自从开展“学习好八连、迎接队代会”的活动，全中队面貌有了很大改变，荣获长沙市“五好”中队的称号。上海建春女子中学，掀起学习“好八连”的热潮后，改变了过去她们生活散漫、乱花钱的习惯，推动了学习。不久前，她们还到八连来汇报了她们的学习优异成绩。　　（陈向东　胡瑞松）英雄的水兵
    中国人民解放军海军某艇队，听到一个消息：一只小渔船在浅海捕鱼突然遭遇猛风暴雨袭击，被浪涛冲跑了。某炮艇上的水兵，闻讯后立即驾艇出海。这时，海上狂风大作，暴雨倾盆。炮艇一会被浪峰举起，一会又陷入深深的浪谷。水兵们趁着每次艇身停在浪峰上的几十秒钟，细心地搜索着海面。
    黑云越压越低，时间已到下午六点半钟，渔船还没找到，水兵们个个暗自焦急。突然，前甲板传来了振奋人心的声音：“左舷二十度发现一块黑色物体！”在后甲板负责了望的水雷班长龙三阳，此刻也看到这个在浪涛中忽隐忽现的目标。他立即提起缆绳，拿着救生圈，站到栏杆边上。目标迅速靠近，确是小渔船，船上的三个人，举起竹斗笠使劲向水兵们挥舞。炮艇迅速向渔船靠去。龙三阳把缆绳抛到渔船上，可是一次，两次，渔民们都没能把缆绳接住，眼看又一个横浪过来了，这一浪，炮艇准得把渔船撞碎，水兵们急得满额大汗。这时，龙三阳一步跨过栏杆，顺着浪势，腾空跃过几米的水面，跳到小船上，用双手和肩膀死命顶住冲过来的炮艇。炮艇上的水兵也手急眼快地垫上碰垫。这样，避免一场船沉人亡的危险。
    原来这三个渔民拂晓出海捕鱼时，是个日暖风和的好天气，只穿着一件单衣。谁料不到中午，风向突然一转，西边乌云一起，立即雷鸣电闪，风雨交加。船篷被风刮跑了，取暖和煮食的柴火泡在水里，他们在寒冷和饥饿中与风浪搏斗了七个小时，如今已浑身没劲，手脚冻僵了。在炮艇没来时，他们还能拼着最后一点力气与死亡搏斗，此刻见水兵已到，知道“得救了”，他们便再也无力动弹。他们看着龙三阳奋不顾身地跳到渔船上，不禁眼睛发热，泪水夺眶而出。龙三阳也激动地把他们一把搂在怀里，趁着渔船被浪峰举起的刹那，把他们拦腰抱起送过炮艇上。三个渔民的生命就这样从风浪里夺回来了。
