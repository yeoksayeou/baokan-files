    Learning	Qiao Yuan
    There are many kinds of learning, but now we will only talk about learning from grassroots cadres.
    "Any leading personnel who do not obtain specific experience from individual personnel or individual events in individual units at the lower level will certainly be unable to provide universal guidance to all units." The Central Committee's decision on methods of leadership says this, and it is most profound.
    Since the implementation of the "two-five system," the vast majority of cadres have gone to the countryside and deep into the grassroots. This is a new atmosphere and is welcome. They go to participate in production and lead production, and the issue of learning is very important. Grassroots work is carried out by grassroots cadres mobilizing and organizing the broad masses. Many grassroots cadres have personal experience and rich insights into the work they do themselves. They are familiar with every aspect of production and have a thorough understanding of the ideological situation of the masses. They are all local Zhuge Liangs, remarkable talents who know the weather, understand the terrain, and have the support of the people. If cadres who go to the countryside want to guide grassroots work, they must be good at consulting these Zhuge Liangs. One person's experience may not be much, but the experience of ten people is sure to be a lot. Summarizing their experiences, systematizing their experiences, and then promoting these experiences will be effective. Because these experiences come from grassroots cadres and are used by grassroots cadres, they will naturally be able to handle them easily and use them freely.
    Of course, leading cadres can also go deep into the front lines, settle down and stay at selected spots, and create their own experiences. But what kind of experiences do they create? It should be experience in grassroots work. They should still learn from grassroots cadres. They rely on grassroots cadres and the broad masses to get things done, and this is how they can gain good experience. Otherwise, relying only on themselves, taking care of everything, and leaving grassroots cadres and the masses, although it is possible to get things done, it is often done poorly. This kind of experience of personal monopoly is not good experience, and when promoted to grassroots cadres and the masses, it will certainly not be compatible and will end in failure. Therefore, leading cadres going deep into the front lines, settling down and staying at selected spots, and doing it themselves must still learn from grassroots cadres.
    If you only learn from others without any practical work experience of your own, you will inevitably not understand deeply, and there will be many caricatures and many assumptions. Moreover, it is often difficult to learn because you are not familiar with the situation at the lower level and do not understand the actual process. Therefore, we must advocate doing and learning, learning while doing, learning from doing, and doing while learning. This will blend together and connect the arteries and veins, allowing you to learn the essence of things.
    To learn well from grassroots cadres, you need to settle down. There is an ancient Chinese saying, "Sincerity brings spiritual response," which can be used here. If you are sincere, believe that there is something to learn, and learn seriously, you can naturally learn it. Since you can learn it, your heart will be more determined. If you are not sincere, believe that there is nothing to learn, and do not learn seriously, you will naturally not be able to learn it. Since you cannot learn it, your heart will be more lax. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Without full enthusiasm, without the determination to look downward, without the desire for knowledge, without putting down airs and being willing to be a primary school student, it is impossible to do it and it will certainly not be done well." (Preface to Rural Surveys) Therefore, cadres who go to the countryside should develop a habit of first being a student and then being a teacher. Being a student is for being a teacher, learning is for guiding; to be a good teacher, you must first be a student, and to guide well, you must first learn. Be sincere and respectful, learn honestly, and learn from individual personnel and individual events in individual units. The Central Committee's instructions on methods of leadership specifically emphasized the word "individual," why? It is to prevent everyone from just talking about learning in a general and vague way, without actually learning. To learn, you must learn earnestly, learn from the example of one person, learn from one work experience... You can't just talk about it. Generally speaking, learning is acknowledged, but specifically going to learn is not acknowledged, which is absolutely unacceptable. We must strive to avoid empty talk and seek practicality, learn with an open mind, and constantly enhance our leadership skills. This is something that anyone must do personally and cannot be replaced by others.

    学有多种，现在只来讲向基层干部学习。
    “任何领导人员，凡不从下级个别单位的个别人员、个别事件取得具体经验者，必不能向一切单位作普遍的指导。”中央关于领导方法的决定中这样说，是最深刻不过的了。
    实行“二五制”以来，绝大多数干部下乡，深入基层，这是一种新兴的气象，是值得欢迎的。他们去参加生产、领导生产，其中有一个学的问题很为重要。基层工作，是由基层干部动员和组织广大群众来进行的。很多基层干部对自己亲手所做的工作，有亲身的经验，丰富的体会。他们对于生产的每一个环节，熟稔于心；对于群众的思想情况，了如指掌。他们都是些当地的诸葛亮，是了不起的人才，知天时，识地利，得人和。下乡干部要指导基层工作，就要善于向这些诸葛亮请教。一个人的经验也许不多，十个人的经验定然许多。总结他们的经验，把他们的经验系统化，然后，再把这些经验推广，就会行之有效。因为这些经验是从基层干部中来，又是用到基层干部中去的，他们自然得心应手，运用自如。
    当然，领导干部自己也可以深入第一线，落脚蹲点，自己去创造经验。但是，他们创造的是什么经验呢？应当是基层工作的经验。他们仍然应当向基层干部学习。他们依靠基层干部和广大群众，把事情办起来，这才能取得好经验。不然，只依靠他自己，包打天下，离开了基层干部和群众，虽然有可能把事情也办起来了，但是，那常常是办不好的。这样个人包办的经验，不是好经验，推广到基层干部和群众中去，一定方圆不相投，碰了钉子完事。所以，领导干部深入第一线，落脚蹲点，自己去干，仍然必须向基层干部学习。
    如果光去学人家的，而自己没有一点实际工作的体会，必然也领会不深刻，漫画式的居多，想当然的不少。而且，又往往由于不熟悉下情，不懂实际过程，学不下去。所以，我们要提倡又干又学，边干边学，从干中学，在学中干，这就会水乳交融，脉胳相连，把骨子里的东西学得到手。
    要向基层干部学得好，便需要安下心来。我国有句古话，“诚则灵”，倒可以用到这个地方。心诚，认为有可学，认真去学，自然可以学到，既然可以学到，其心愈坚。心不诚，认为无什么可学，不认真去学，自然不可能学得到，既然学不到，其心愈懈。毛泽东同志说过，“没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子、甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做，也一定做不好的。”（农村调查序言）所以，下乡干部要养成一种习惯，要先做学生，后做先生。做学生，是为了做先生，学习是为了去指导；要做好先生，必须先做学生，要指导好必须先学习。心诚意恭，老老实实地学，向个别单位的个别人员、个别事件学习。中央关于领导方法的指示中，特别强调了“个别”的字样，为什么？就是要大家不能只泛泛地笼统地去讲学习，而不切实地去学习。要学习，就得切切实实，向一个人的榜样学习，向一件工作经验学习……不能只是在嘴头上讲。一般地讲学习承认，具体地去学习不承认，那是万万要不得的。力戒空疏，务求实际，虚心学习，不断增强自己的领导才干，这是任何人必须亲自动手去做，而不能由别人来代替的。
