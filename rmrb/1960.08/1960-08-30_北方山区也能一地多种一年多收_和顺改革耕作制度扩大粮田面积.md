(Our newspaper Taiyuan, August 29th dispatch) Heshun County, Shanxi Province, has reformed its cultivation system, changing from single cropping per plot to multiple cropping per plot, and from one harvest per year to multiple harvests per year. This year, the county's intercropping and interplanting area for grain crops accounts for 78.3% of all cultivated land.

Heshun County has always practiced single cropping per plot, with one harvest per year, resulting in a very low land utilization rate. The CCP Heshun County Committee conducted a comprehensive and in-depth investigation and study of crop planting and land utilization, and carefully summarized various advanced experiences in improving land utilization. On this basis, Heshun County universally promoted methods such as intercropping, mixed planting, and interplanting, i.e., intercropping and mixed planting of tall-stalk crops with low-stalk crops, deep-rooted crops with shallow-rooted crops, gramineous crops with leguminous crops, and crops with short growing periods with crops with long growing periods. For example, potatoes and small beans were interplanted in the spaces between plants and rows in cornfields, and spring cabbage and cowpeas were commonly mixed planted; after harvesting spring cabbage, radishes were planted; soybeans and sorghum were commonly interplanted in valley fields, and radishes were replanted in the gaps; corn, turnips, and red radishes were interplanted in potato fields; small beans were interplanted in wheat fields. The county's intercropping and interplanting area for grain crops reached 235,000 mu, accounting for 78.3% of the total area, an increase of 1.5 times compared to last year. Secondly, great efforts were made to promote agroforestry intercropping, utilizing the gaps in forest land and orchards, and adopting the method of digging pits and planting seeds, intercropping beans, potatoes, oil crops, and other crops in 11,200 mu of forest land. Facts have proven that as long as we can correctly grasp the laws of growth and development of various crops, and carry out reasonable allocation in intercropping and interplanting, not only will the several crops growing simultaneously on one plot of land not affect each other, but they can also play a complementary and mutually promoting role, achieving multiple harvests and multiple benefits.

Due to Heshun County's reform of the cultivation system, changing from one crop per year to two crops per year or five crops in two years, breaking the old tradition that Heshun's cold climate only allowed for one harvest per year, the county's summer harvest crop area this year expanded by 7,628 mu compared to last year. The summer harvest crops grown in Heshun County are generally on some barren slopes, which in the past yielded less than 100 jin per mu with one crop per year. After implementing interplanting and replanting, the average yield generally ranges from 250 jin to 300 jin per mu.

With the promotion of this cultivation system, Heshun County's labor demand is increasing. Under this new situation, the County Committee timely and clearly put forward the need to concentrate superior forces, focus on the agricultural front, and ensure that 70% to 80% of the labor force is invested in field labor during the busy seasons of spring sowing and summer hoeing. At the same time, a mass technical innovation movement was launched, which greatly strengthened agricultural production and promoted the reform of the cultivation system.

### 北方山区也能一地多种一年多收  和顺改革耕作制度扩大粮田面积

    北方山区也能一地多种一年多收
    和顺改革耕作制度扩大粮田面积
    本报太原29日电　山西省和顺县改革耕作制度，变一地单种为一地多种，变一年一收为一年多收，今年全县粮食间作套种面积占全部耕地的78.3％。
    和顺县一向是一地单作，一年一收，土地利用率很低。中共和顺县委对作物种植和土地利用情况进行了全面深入的调查研究，认真总结了在提高土地利用率方面的各种先进经验。在这个基础上，和顺县普遍推行了间作、混种、套种等方法，即高秆作物与低秆作物、深根作物与浅根作物、禾本作物与豆科作物、生长期短的作物与生长期长的作物相互间作混种。如在玉米地内的株、行距的空间套种间作了马铃薯和小豆，并且普遍混种春白菜和豆角，收了春白菜又种上萝卜；在谷地内普遍间种套种了黄豆、高粱，在缺苗空处又补栽了萝卜；在马铃薯地内套种了玉米、蔓菁、红萝卜；麦地内套种了小豆。全县粮食作物间作套种面积达二十三万五千亩，占总面积的78.3％，比去年增加了一点五倍。其次，大抓农林间作，利用林地和果园地的空隙，采取挖坑点播的方法，在一万一千二百亩林地内间作了豆类、马铃薯、油料等作物。事实证明，只要能正确掌握各种作物生长和发展的规律，在间作套种上进行合理的配置，不仅在一块土地上同时生长的几种作物不相互影响，而且还能发挥相辅相成、互相促进的作用，起到多种多收多效能。
    由于和顺县改革了耕作制度，变一年一作为一年两作或两年五作，打破了和顺气候寒冷，一年只能收一季的老传统，全县夏收作物面积今年比去年扩大了七千六百二十八亩。和顺县种夏收作物一般都是一些瘠薄的坡地，过去一年一作，亩产一般达不到一百斤。实行了套种复播后，一般亩产平均二百五十斤到三百斤。
    随着这一耕作制度的推行，和顺县劳力需要越来越多。县委在这一新形势下，及时而明确地提出了集中优越兵力，主攻农业战线，在春播、夏锄的农忙季节，保证了70％至80％的劳力投入田间劳动。同时，开展了群众性的技术革新运动，大大加强了农业生产，促进了耕作制度的改革。
