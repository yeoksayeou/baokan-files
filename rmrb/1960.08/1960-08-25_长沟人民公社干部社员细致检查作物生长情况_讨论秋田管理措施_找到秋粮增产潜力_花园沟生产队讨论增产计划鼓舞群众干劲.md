The Changgou People's Commune in Fangshan County, Beijing, recently mobilized its members to inspect agricultural production for the first seven months of this year. Based on the different characteristics of the current crop growth, they determined specific measures to further strengthen autumn field management, launching a vigorous overproduction campaign to strive for a greater autumn grain harvest.

Since last winter, Beijing had experienced seven consecutive months without significant rainfall. Commune members waged a tenacious struggle against the drought, excavating the 46.5-li-long "March 8th" irrigation canal last winter and spring, which irrigated the fields on both sides, resulting in good crop growth. Areas previously considered backward in production have also undergone significant changes. Some low-lying areas that were abandoned in previous years have now established high-yield plots with the help of the commune Party committee, with leveled land and robust crops. There is great hope for increased production in high-yield crops, accounting for 90% of all farmland.

Could more grain be harvested, on top of the achievements already made in the first seven months? When various production teams inspected the previous stage of production, the broad masses of cadres and members believed that "now, with a little more effort, we can harvest more grain in the autumn," and "crops are not harvested until the day they are harvested, and management cannot stop for a single day." However, a few members also believed that "the Beginning of Autumn has passed, the overall situation is set, and there are not many management measures left," and "the rice is growing so well, there is nothing to manage." In response to this situation, the commune Party committee immediately mobilized all cadres and members to discuss issues such as "whether or not to further strengthen field management" and "how to strengthen field management," and organized cadres at all levels and some experienced farmers to conduct inspections in the fields. They found three types of seedlings in the high-yield fields, and in remote areas, there were loopholes in management work such as weeds not being cleared, lack of fertilizer and water, and pest and disease damage. The members saw the potential for increased production from the inspection.

Each production team, based on its specific situation, studied measures to further strengthen field management, launching a vigorous overproduction campaign. Members of the rice high-yield plot professional team put forward measures according to the growth status of the rice fields, including controlling water use in high-yield fields, applying phosphorus and potassium fertilizer to prevent lodging, applying eccentric fertilizer to the three types of seedlings, and organizing professional teams to generally treat rice blast. The commune Party committee summarized the various opinions put forward by the members, proposing to weed again, apply fertilizer again, generally eliminate pests and diseases, pay attention to drought development, explore water sources, and prepare for drought resistance. They also summarized the experiences of the masses, proposing several major measures for the commune's current production increase: First, more than 15,000 mu of spring corn that is about to mature should be generally shallow-tilled once to promote full grain and early maturity, freeing up some land early to plant Chinese cabbage on the ridges and interplant wheat between the rows to increase one more crop. Second, artificial pollination should be carried out as much as possible on more than 27,000 mu of densely planted late corn to increase yield. Third, sweet potato fields of 40,000 mu should be timely lifted, and foliar application of phosphorus should be carried out, with the corn interplanted in the middle generally topped and de-leafed to increase light exposure to the sweet potato fields and increase yield. After discussion, the members believed that implementing these measures would make it possible to increase grain production on the existing basis.

In order to ensure the realization of these production increase measures, the entire commune concentrated leadership, concentrated strong labor, and concentrated high-quality fertilizer to the front line of autumn field management. The four secretaries and ten members of the commune Party committee divided up the production brigades to take charge and personally command, and dispatched twenty capable cadres to serve as deputy positions in production teams with large production tasks and weak leadership to strengthen the leadership of production. On the basis of having already transferred about 80% of the labor force to the agricultural front line, a further batch of Party and League members were added, and some strong labor was transferred, and the "four fix" system of fixed task, fixed quality, fixed work points, and fixed rewards was generally implemented to improve labor efficiency. The commune's chemical fertilizer, human manure and other fast-acting high-quality fertilizers were concentrated on autumn fields.

At present, the overproduction campaign in this commune has formed a climax. The labor force participating in autumn field management in the entire commune has increased from 5,000 people a few days ago to 7,000 people. The progress of various production activities has accelerated, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated every day has surged to 40 million jin. After the Banbidian Production Team and the Luozhuang Production Team launched a competition, they have generally weeded 2,000 mu of autumn fields and applied fertilizer to 600 mu of late fields. The commune fertilizer factory and farm implement repair factory are also rushing to produce ammonia water, granular fertilizer and various field management tools to support the needs of grain production increase.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 23rd. The Huayuangou Production Team of the Chengguan Commune in Yulin County, Shaanxi Province, concentrated 86% of its labor force and launched an autumn field management upsurge centered on weeding and topdressing to strive for autumn grain overproduction. On the 19th and 20th, the labor efficiency of the members who participated in weeding in the entire team increased by 21% compared with the past. Five fertilizer accumulation shock teams composed of eighty-five people accumulated 384,000 jin of fertilizer, meeting the needs of 210 mu of autumn fields to apply overproduction fertilizer.

The Huayuangou Production Team is famous everywhere for its good soil and water conservation and high yields year after year. After the cadres and members of this team listened to the People's Daily editorial "Immediately Launch an Increase Production and Economy Campaign Centered on Grain and Steel" on the radio on the 18th, they held a Party branch committee, team committee, and Party and League member meeting and member meeting on the same day to conduct discussions, comprehensively and deeply check and summarize the situation and experience of increasing production and practicing economy in the first seven and a half months of this year, and formulate plans and measures for increasing production and practicing economy in the next four and a half months. After learning and discussion, the enthusiasm of the members to vigorously engage in the autumn field overproduction campaign was even more encouraged. The members believed that as long as they strengthened late-stage management, there was great hope for autumn grain production increase. Chen Keming, a 67-year-old man, used the agricultural proverbs "hoe eight times, reap seven times, eight meters of rice bran" and "hoe in the morning, cut in the afternoon, one mu adds three he" to illustrate the importance of late-stage management. Cadres and members, everyone offered ideas and everyone thought of ways to jointly formulate autumn field overproduction plans and measures. The entire team decided to weed one more super-yield grass, apply one more super-yield fertilizer, and irrigate one more super-yield water on the basis of the original plan for all autumn fields, and established a "five prevention" group to ensure that they do a good job in preventing floods, waterlogging, hail, frost, and controlling pests and diseases to ensure a good harvest. In order to ensure the implementation of these overproduction measures, the entire team transferred 64 laborers from farmland capital construction, sideline production, and welfare undertakings to strengthen the agricultural front, so that the labor force participating in field production increased from the original 83% to 86%.

    长沟人民公社干部社员细致检查作物生长情况
    讨论秋田管理措施  找到秋粮增产潜力
    花园沟生产队讨论增产计划鼓舞群众干劲
    本报讯　北京市房山县长沟人民公社最近发动社员检查了今年前七个多月的农业生产情况，并按照当前各种作物生长的不同特点，确定进一步加强秋田管理的具体措施，掀起了轰轰烈烈的超产运动，力争多收一些秋粮。
    北京从去冬以来，曾经连续七个月没下过透雨，社员们和干旱进行了顽强的斗争，在去冬今春开挖了长达四十六点五里的“三八”灌渠，两旁的农田得到灌溉，作物生长良好。过去被认为生产落后的地区，面貌也大有改变，一些往年荒废的洼地，今年在公社党委帮助下，建立了丰产方，土地平整，作物茁壮。占全部农田90％的高产作物，增产大有希望。
    在前七个月已经获得成就的基础上，能不能再争取多收一些粮食？在前些日子各个生产队检查上阶段生产情况的时候，广大干部、社员认为，“现在多加一把劲，秋后还能多收一些粮”，“庄稼一天不收，管理一天不能停”。但是也有少数社员认为“立秋已过，大局已定，管理措施不多了”，“水稻长得这么好，没有什么可管的了”。公社党委针对这种情况，立即发动全社干部、社员讨论了“要不要再加强田间管理”和“如何加强田间管理”等问题，并且组织各级干部和一部分老农会师田间，进行检查，发现丰产田里有三类苗；偏僻地区还有草未锄净、缺肥缺水和病虫为害等管理工作上的漏洞。社员们从检查中看到了增产的潜力。
    各个生产队根据自己的具体情况，研究了进一步加强田间管理的措施，掀起了轰轰烈烈的超产运动。水稻丰产方专业队的社员们按照稻田的生长状况，分别提出了高产田控制用水、加施磷钾肥，防止倒伏；三类苗追施偏心肥；组织专业队普治稻瘟病等措施。公社党委归纳了社员提出的各种意见，提出要再锄一遍草，再追一次肥，普除病虫害和注意旱情发展，挖掘水源，准备抗旱，并且总结了群众的经验，提出了全社当前增产的几个主要措施：第一，一万五千多亩即将成熟的春玉米，要普遍浅锄一次，促使粒饱早熟，提早腾出一部分土地，垅上栽白菜，行间套种小麦，增加一茬作物。第二，二万七千多亩密植晚玉米，尽可能进行人工授粉，增加产量。第三，四万亩白薯地及时提蔓，实行根外喷磷，其中间作的玉米普遍去顶打叶，增加薯地光照，提高产量。经过讨论以后，社员们认为实行这些办法，就有可能在现有基础上多增产粮食。
    为了保证这些增产措施的实现，全公社集中领导力量，集中强壮劳动力，集中优质肥料到秋田管理第一线。公社党委四名书记和十个委员，分片包干各生产大队，亲自坐阵指挥，并且调派二十名得力干部到生产任务大、领导力量薄弱的生产队担任副职，加强生产的领导；在已经抽调80％左右的劳力到农业第一线的基础上，继续增派一批党团员骨干，调换一些强壮劳力，并且普遍推行“定任务、定质量、定工分、定奖励”的定额管理生产责任制度，以提高劳动工效；集中全社的化肥、人粪尿等速效优质肥料用到秋田。
    目前，这个公社的超产运动已经形成高潮。全社参加秋田管理的劳动力，已经从前几天的五千人增加到七千人。各项生产活动进度加快，每天积肥的数量猛增到四千万斤。半壁店生产队和洛庄生产队展开对手赛以后，已经把两千亩秋田普锄一遍，为六百亩晚田追施了肥料。公社肥料厂、农具修配厂也在赶制氨水、颗粒肥和各种田间管理工具，支援粮食增产的需要。
    新华社西安23日电　陕西榆林县城关公社花园沟生产队集中86％的劳力，掀起了以锄草、追肥为中心的秋田管理高潮，力争秋粮超产。19、20两天，全队参加锄草的社员，劳动效率比过去提高21％；由八十五人组成的五个积肥突击队，积肥三十八万四千斤，满足了二百一十亩秋田追施超产肥的需要。
    花园沟生产队以水土保持搞得好连年高产闻名各地。这个队的干部和社员，18日在收音机中收听了人民日报的社论——“立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”以后，当天就举行了党的支部委员会、队委会和党团员大会、社员会，进行讨论，全面深入地检查总结了今年前七个半月增产节约的情况和经验，制订了以后四个半月增产节约的计划和措施。经过学习和讨论，更加鼓舞了社员大搞秋田超产运动的干劲。社员们认为，只要加强后期管理，秋粮增产大有希望。六十七岁的陈克明老汉以“锄八次，捞七次，八米二糠”和“前晌锄，后晌割，一亩加三合”的农谚，说明后期管理的重要性。干部和社员，人人出主意，个个想办法，共同制订了秋田超产计划和措施。全队的秋田，决定在原计划的基础上，多锄一次超产草，多追一次超产肥，多灌一次超产水，并且成立“五防”小组，保证做好防洪、防涝、防雹、防冻、防治病虫害的工作，力保丰收。为了保证贯彻这些超产措施，全队又从农田基本建设、副业生产和福利事业等方面，抽调出六十四个劳力，增强农业战线，使参加田间生产的劳力由原来83％增加到86％。（附图片）
