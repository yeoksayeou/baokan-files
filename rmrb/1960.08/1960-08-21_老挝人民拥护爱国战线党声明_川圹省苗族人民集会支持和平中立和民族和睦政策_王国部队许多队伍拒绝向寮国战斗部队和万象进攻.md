Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th – According to a Lao Fighting Forces radio broadcast on the 19th, people from all walks of life in Laos warmly support the statement issued by the Lao Patriotic Front on the current situation in Laos. The statement expressed support for the policies of the coup committee headed by Kong Le and suggested joint action with the coup committee to achieve national harmony and genuine peace and neutrality for Laos.

The Lao Fighting Forces radio station said that as of the 18th, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front had received thousands of letters from people of all walks of life in Laos. These letters were signed by 33,000 people, including officials, officers and soldiers of the Lao Royal Army. These letters demonstrate that the Lao people resolutely support the line and propositions put forward by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th – According to a Lao Fighting Forces radio broadcast, the Hmong people of Xieng Khouang Province, Laos, held a rally to condemn the crimes of the Phoumi Nosavan clique in persecuting and massacring the Hmong people, and expressed support for the policies of the Lao Patriotic Front, the new government, and the coup committee to promote peace, neutrality, and national harmony in Laos.

At the rally, the representative of the Lao Patriotic Front's Xieng Khouang Provincial Committee, Reu (Hmong), said that the lackey of U.S. imperialism, the Phoumi Nosavan clique, had murdered the Hmong people's parliamentary candidate, Phetsone, and hundreds of Hmong people. They even poisoned the water wells in Xianlun, poisoning seventeen people and killing some. In addition, they burned down villages such as Xannat and many granaries, forced Hmong residents of villages such as Huailao to move to concentration camps, and grabbed Hmong youths to use as cannon fodder.

The Hmong people who participated in the above-mentioned rally unanimously passed a letter of suggestion to the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Phouma government, and the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le. The suggestion expressed the Hmong people's hatred for U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and expressed support and trust in the Lao Patriotic Front, the Phouma government, and the coup committee's policies and lines to stop the Lao people from killing each other and to promote genuine peace, neutrality, and national harmony in Laos.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th – According to Vietnam News Agency: According to "Voice of the Lao Fighting Forces," many units of the Lao Royal Army in Lower Laos, still under the control of the rebellious Phoumi Nosavan, have refused to carry out Nosavan's orders to attack the Lao Fighting Forces and advance on Vientiane.

The radio station also reported on August 17 that many units received orders from pro-American militarists to carry out attacks in Luang Prabang Province, but they responded to the call of the coup committee and have withdrawn to the capital of the province.

In Nam Nga, So Hong, and So Nao in Phongsaly Province, the Royal Army launched an uprising, and with the cooperation of the People's Guerrilla Forces, killed those stubborn officers who declared "loyalty" to Nosavan. In the First Parachute Battalion, Lieutenant Dan called on his soldiers not to fight against the Second Parachute Battalion commanded by Captain Kong Le. After this, Nosavan ordered the arrest of Lieutenant Dan. This caused strong indignation throughout the battalion. Many soldiers publicly declared that Nosavan himself should be condemned.

In the Third Military Region, it is said that a senior military officer revealed to his soldiers Nosavan's conspiracy to deceive the Royal Army and attempt to launch another civil war in Laos.

    王国部队许多队伍拒绝向寮国战斗部队和万象进攻
    新华社河内20日电　据寮国战斗部队广播电台19日报道，老挝各阶层人民热烈拥护老挝爱国战线党就老挝当前局势发表的声明。这个声明表示支持以贡勒为首的政变委员会的政策，并且建议同政变委员会采取共同行动，以实现民族和睦和老挝的真正和平与中立。
    寮国战斗部队电台说，到18日为止，老挝爱国战线党中央已经接到了老挝各阶层人民寄来的上千封信。在这些信上签名的达三万三千人，其中有职员、老挝王国军队的军官和士兵。这些信件表明了，老挝人民坚决拥护老挝爱国战线党中央所提出的路线和主张。
    新华社河内20日电　据寮国战斗部队电台广播，老挝川圹省苗族人民举行集会谴责了富米·诺萨万集团迫害残杀苗族人民的罪行，并且表示支持老挝爱国战线党、新政府和政变委员会促使老挝实现和平、中立和民族和睦的政策。
    在集会上，老挝爱国战线党川圹省委员会代表热乌（苗族）说，美帝国主义走狗富米·诺萨万集团杀害了苗族人民的国会议员候选人费桑和成百名苗族人民，他们甚至在咸伦的水井里投毒，使十七人中毒和一些人被毒死。此外，他们还烧毁了山纳等乡村和许多谷仓，强迫会劳等乡村苗族居民迁移到集中营里，把苗族青年抓去充当它们的炮灰。
    参加上述集会的苗族人民一致通过了给老挝爱国战线党中央委员会、富马政府和以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会的建议书。建议书表达了苗族人民对美帝国主义及其走狗的仇恨，并表示支持和信赖老挝爱国战线党、富马政府和政变委员会制止老挝人民自相残杀，促使老挝实行真正的和平中立和民族和睦的政策和路线。
    新华社河内20日电　据越南通讯社报道：据“寮国战斗部队之声”报道，仍然在叛乱的富米·诺萨万控制下的下老挝的很多老挝王国部队，拒绝执行诺萨万要求他们进攻寮国战斗部队和向万象推进的命令。
    这家电台8月17日还报道说，很多部队从亲美的军国主义分子那里接到在琅勃拉邦省进行袭击的命令，但他们响应了政变委员会的号召，已撤至这个省的首府。
    在丰沙里省的南峨、索洪和索脑，王国军队举行了起义，他们在人民游击部队的合作下，杀死了宣布“忠于”诺萨万的那些顽固的军官。在第一伞兵营，丹少尉号召他的士兵不要同贡勒大尉所指挥的第二伞兵营作战。在这以后，诺萨万命令把丹少尉逮捕。这在整个营里引起了强烈的愤慨。很多军人公开宣布，应受谴责的是诺萨万自己。
    在第三防区，据说一名高级军官向他的士兵揭露了诺萨万欺骗王国军队，企图在老挝发动另一次内战的阴谋。（附图片）
