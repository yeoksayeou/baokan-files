Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 20th (TASS): TASS communiqué: After completing the planned one-day observation schedule and obtaining materials on the life activities of the animals and the normal operation of the systems on the satellite-type spaceship, an order was issued to have the ship descend from its orbit. The command was issued when the ship reached its eighteenth orbit. The satellite-type spaceship's control system and braking device worked with great precision, ensuring that the ship landed in the predetermined area. The deviation of the landing point from the predetermined landing point was approximately ten kilometers.

    The satellite-type spaceship weighs four thousand six hundred kilograms (excluding the weight of the last stage of the carrier rocket), and has a special heat shield that successfully passed through the Earth's atmosphere. The satellite-type spaceship and the container containing the experimental animals that had separated from it have both landed successfully.

    Airplanes and helicopters have transported medical and technical personnel to the landing site.

    All experimental animals, including the two dogs "Little Arrow" and "Squirrel," are feeling well after the flight and landing.

    A comprehensive examination of the animals returning after completing the space flight is now underway. The instruments ensured the normal life activities of the animals during the flight.

    Thus, for the first time in history, animals have successfully returned to Earth after completing a space flight of more than 700,000 kilometers.

    The launch and return to Earth of the satellite-type spaceship, created by the genius of Soviet scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers, is a prelude to human flight into interplanetary space.

    苏联宇宙飞船安全返回地球
    试验用动物在飞行和着陆后感觉良好
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社莫斯科20日电：塔斯社公报：在完成了预计一昼夜的考察计划并获得了关于动物的生命活动和关于卫星式飞船上的系统工作正常的材料以后，已经发出了要飞船从轨道上下降的命令。命令是在飞船转到第十八圈的时候发出的。卫星式飞船的操纵系统和制动装置工作高度精确，保证了飞船降落到预定地区。着陆点同预定着陆点的偏差约为十公里。
    卫星式飞船重四千六百公斤（不算运载火箭最后一级的重量），有一个专门的防热层，成功地通过了地球大气。卫星式飞船和已同它分离的、装有试验用动物的容器都己顺利着陆。
    飞机和直升飞机已把医务人员和技术人员送到着陆地点。
    所有试验用动物，其中包括两条狗“小箭”和“松鼠”。在飞行和着陆之后感觉良好。
    现在正在对完成宇宙飞行后回来的动物进行全面检查。仪器保证了动物在飞行中的正常生命活动。
  这样，动物有史以来第一次在完成了七十万公里以上的宇宙飞行后顺利返回地球。
    苏联的科学家、工程师、技术员和工人的天才所创造出来的卫星式宇宙飞船的发射和返回地球，是人飞往行星际空间的前奏。
