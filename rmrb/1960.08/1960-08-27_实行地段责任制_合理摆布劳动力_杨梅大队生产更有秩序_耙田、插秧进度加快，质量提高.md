(Reported by this newspaper) The Yangmei Brigade of the Hekou Commune in Sanshui County, Guangdong Province, based on the new situation of concentrating superior labor in the front line, has formulated a labor management method of "Team-Based Output Quotas with Permanent Fixed-Group Land Responsibility System," making production more planned and orderly.

The specific content of the "Team-Based Output Quotas with Permanent Fixed-Group Land Responsibility System" in the Yangmei Brigade is as follows: production teams are the output quota units, and labor is divided into several work groups. The work groups implement "five fixings" – leadership, labor, land, draft cattle, and farm tools – and "three guarantees" – time, task, and quality. Payment is based on piecework, with rewards distributed to individuals. After grouping, production plans and measures are still formulated by the production team, and large farm tools are still uniformly used and allocated by the team. The work group is a specific combat unit under the unified command of the team. Under normal circumstances, the work group remains fixed within its own land area throughout the year, ensuring completion according to the tasks assigned by the production team and the stipulated time and quality. Production teams generally do not randomly transfer labor from work groups. If special circumstances and natural disasters arise, and the production team must uniformly extract labor, then temporary cooperation is carried out. However, cooperation must implement the principle of equivalent exchange or adopt the method of substituting work for labor to resolve mutual benefit issues.

Since the Yangmei Brigade implemented this management method, a new atmosphere has emerged in production. First, the sense of responsibility of the commune members has been enhanced, and the enthusiasm and initiative for production have been greatly improved. After the sense of responsibility of the commune members is strengthened, a whole set of management methods and various responsibility systems such as work point evaluation, quota management, quality inspection, and reward and punishment systems can be implemented to the end under the supervision of the masses, resulting in a situation where "everyone shoulders a heavy burden" and commune members supervise and help each other.

From July onwards, the entire brigade's work point evaluation, inspection and acceptance, and other complete management systems have been restored. Even during the busy farming season, the systems can still be adhered to. Commune members said: "The fixed land responsibility system is a responsibility system that is truly implemented!"

After the implementation of the permanent fixed work group land responsibility system, the labor force of the production team has been rationally allocated. While organizing work groups, the distance of the land, the difficulty of cultivation, the strength of the labor force, the tools, etc., are all appropriately matched. The production team leader only needs to plan the production of the entire team once every few days, and the work group can then take the initiative to make arrangements in the fields according to the plan and tasks assigned by the production team, eliminating the phenomenon of wasted labor.

After rectifying the labor organization, the production efficiency and work quality of the entire Yangmei Brigade have been significantly improved. During the summer planting season, the average daily harrowing per person in the entire brigade increased from two or three mu to five or six mu, rice transplanting increased from five or six fen of land to more than one mu, and land reclamation increased from one and a half mu to three mu. The entire team exceeded the planned late rice planting area by 20%.

    实行地段责任制  合理摆布劳动力
    杨梅大队生产更有秩序
    耙田、插秧进度加快，质量提高
    本报讯　广东省三水县河口公社杨梅大队，根据优势劳力集中第一线的新情况，制订了“以队包产，常年固定小组地段责任制”的劳动管理办法，使生产更有计划、更有秩序地进行。
    杨梅大队“以队包产、常年固定小组地段责任制”的具体内容是：以生产队为包产单位，把劳动力划分为若干个作业小组。作业小组实行领导、劳动力、地段、耕牛、农具“五固定”和时间、任务、质量“三包”，按件计酬，奖励到人。分组以后，生产计划、措施仍然由生产队制定，大农具仍然由队统一使用和统一调拨。作业组是在队的统一指挥下的具体作战单位。在正常情况下，作业组常年固定在自己的地段内活动，根据生产队分配的任务和定出的时间、质量，保证完成。生产队一般不乱调动作业小组的劳力。如遇有特殊情况和自然灾害，生产队非统一抽调劳动力不行的时候，再搞临时协作。但协作要贯彻等价交换的原则，或采取以分代工的办法解决互利问题。
    杨梅大队自从贯彻执行了这种管理方法以后，生产出现了新气象。首先，社员的责任心增强了，生产的积极性和主动性大大提高。社员的责任心加强以后，评工记分、定额管理、质量检查、奖惩制度等一整套经营管理办法和各种责任制，都能够在群众的监督下贯彻到底，从而出现了一个“千斤担子众人挑”和社员之间互相督促、互相帮助的局面。
    从7月份起，全大队的评工记分、检查验收等整套经营管理制度都恢复了，即使农事大忙，制度一样能够坚持执行。社员说：“固定地段责任制，是一个落实的责任制！”
    实行了常年固定作业小组地段责任制以后，生产队的劳动力得到合理的摆布。在编作业小组的同时，就把土地远近、耕作难易、劳动力强弱、工具等等配搭好，生产队长只需每隔几天对全队生产规划一次，作业小组即发挥主动性，根据生产队布置的计划、任务，在田头妥作安排，消除了窝工现象。
    杨梅大队经过整顿劳动组织，全大队的生产效率和工作质量都显著提高。在夏种中，全大队每人每日耙田由二、三亩增加到五、六亩，插秧由五、六分田增加到一亩以上，开荒由一亩半增加到三亩。全队超额20％完成晚稻种植面积计划。
