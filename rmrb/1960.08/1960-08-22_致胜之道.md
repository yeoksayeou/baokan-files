    The surging movement to increase production and practice economy has begun.

    We must carry out this movement well, and we must comprehensively and overfulfill the national plan. Thousands of enterprises and millions of workers share the same aspiration.

    What is the way to victory? What does the size of the increase in production and economy depend on?

    We have many experiences in the movement to increase production and practice economy. We deeply know that among thousands of methods and measures, launching a mass movement is the most important measure.

    Where the masses are thoroughly mobilized, the more potential is tapped. The wisdom of the masses is infinite, and the potential for production is also "bottomless." If you don't believe it, look at the Tianjin Sixth Electrical Switch Factory. They carried out a major technical revolution in the first half of this year and completed the annual plan in early July. After further mobilizing the masses, they found new potential, and they will achieve a greater leap forward in the second half of the year.

    Where the masses are thoroughly mobilized, the plans are most practical, and the measures are most specific. The enterprise's plan for increasing production and practicing economy is the collection of plans from each team and each person, and the enterprise's measures for increasing production and practicing economy are implemented in each team and each person. How can such plans and measures fail? Judging by the cultivation, we can anticipate the harvest. The Tianjin Sixth Electrical Switch Factory's plan to increase production and practice economy will definitely be completed satisfactorily.

    Where the masses are thoroughly mobilized, even the greatest difficulties will bow their heads. We must do things that ordinary people dare not do, and we must advance at a speed exceeding the norm. How can there be no difficulties at all? However, when the masses rise up, no matter what difficulties will stop us from advancing. If you don't believe it, look at the sudden rainstorms and floods that hit Anshan. However, the heroes of the steel capital fought hard against the disaster, enabling the part of the blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces that were forced to stop production to quickly resume production, allowing molten iron and molten steel to continue to flow.

    Discuss the plan to increase production and practice economy, and mobilize the masses thoroughly. Formulate measures to increase production and practice economy, and mobilize the masses thoroughly. Implement the plan and implement the measures, and mobilize the masses thoroughly. This is our way to victory. To carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy well, we must first rely on this.

    致胜之道
    孔桑
    轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动开始了。
    一定要把这次运动搞好，一定要全面地超额完成国家计划。千百个企业，千万个职工，人同此心。
    什么是致胜之道？增产节约成就的大小取决于什么？
    我们有了许多次的增产节约运动的经验。我们深深地知道，千条办法，万种措施，大搞群众运动是最重要的措施。
    哪里的群众发动得透，哪里的潜力就挖得多。群众的智慧无穷，生产的潜力也无“底”。不信请看，天津第六电器开关厂今年上半年大闹技术革命，7月初就完成了全年计划。再一发动群众，又找到了新的潜力，下半年将实现更大的跃进。
    哪里的群众发动得透，哪里的计划就最切实，措施就最具体。企业的增产节约计划是每一个小组每一个人的计划汇集起来的，企业的增产节约措施落实到每一个小组每一个人。这样的计划和措施，难道还会落空吗？从耕种看收成，天津第六电器开关厂的增产节约计划定将圆满地完成。
    哪里的群众发动得透，天大的困难也会低头。我们要做常人不敢做的事，要以超过常规的速度前进。怎么能完全没有困难呢？但是，群众起来了，就任凭什么困难也挡不住我们前进。不信请看，暴雨洪水突袭鞍山，但是，钢都英雄奋力抗灾，使被迫停产的部分高炉和平炉迅速地恢复了生产，让铁水、钢水又继续奔流。
    讨论增产节约计划，把群众发动透。制定增产节约措施，把群众发动透。实行计划，实行措施，把群众发动透。这就是我们的致胜之道。搞好增产节约运动，首先靠这一条。
