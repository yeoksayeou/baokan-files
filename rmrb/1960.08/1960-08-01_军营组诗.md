    Army Camp Poems	Sergeant Xie Libiao
        Sitting Atop the Cannon at Midnight
    The deep night is pitch black,
    Like a big black wok.
    Inside the tents, all is quiet,
    Anti-aircraft gunner sitting atop the cannon.
    The flying thief buzzes,
    Trembling all over,
    Sneaking to the coastal defense line,
    Wanting to enter the mainland to spread evil.
    The soldier stares intently,
    Anger surges in his heart,
    With the company commander's command,
    The mountains shake, and the sky is filled with fire.
    The enemy plane is hit,
    Burned into an old toad,
    Falling into the sea to feed the turtles,
    A venomous snake put in the oil pot...
    People enter dreamland,
    Soldiers sit atop the cannon,
    The motherland's airspace is most sacred,
    Demons and monsters cannot escape!
          A Letter of Condolence
    I guard the South China Sea,
    Protecting the beautiful spring,
    Receiving letters of condolence from loved ones,
    Each one a poem of passion.
    From the People's Commune,
    From the factory workshop;
    Warriors in the abundant fields,
    Girls beside the looms...
    Those heroic words,
    Like waves roaring,
    My blood boils,
    My whole body is full of strength!
    I use my rough hands,
    To polish the weapon!
    That magnificent muzzle,
    Guarding the sky and the sea!
      Midnight Lights……
    I sling my submachine gun and leave the barracks,
    Taking over the midnight roving patrol,
    People are all having sweet dreams in their quilts,
    Regimental Commander Wang's window is still lit.
    I gently approach the glass window,
    Peering inside, leaning against the glass—
    Oh, Regimental Commander Wang is learning algebra!
    Cigarette butts fill the ashtray on the table.
    Look at the wrinkles on his forehead,
    Recording the road he has traveled;
    Look at his gray hair,
    Experiencing how much of the era's vicissitudes!
    Now, he uses his fortitude.
    Declaring war on culture and science!
    His heart is a pile of unquenchable bonfire,
    Just like this midnight light.
      I Patrol in the Sea of Clouds
    The airport exudes the smell of oil,
    Engines roar day and night,
    Piloting the domestically produced eagles,
    Flying into the vast blue sky.
    Having just draped on the plum blossom snow of the north,
    And smelling the coconut groves of the south;
    Having just stepped on the滔天 waves of the East China Sea,
    And rushed over the high peaks of the southwest…
    Eyes penetrate the dense clouds,
    Thunder roars day and night in the clouds,
    Scattering flowers all over the sky,
    The motherland everywhere is the peaceful spring.
    I patrol in the sea of clouds,
    Ten thousand miles of sky hang in my heart,
    An airspace is a sentry post,
    A cloud seam is a gun eye!

    军营组诗	中士　谢礼标
        深夜炮上坐
    深夜黑漆漆，
    像口大黑锅，
    帐篷里面静悄悄，
    高射炮兵炮上坐。
    飞贼嗡嗡叫，
    全身打哆嗦，
    偷偷窜到海防线，
    想进大陆撒罪恶。
    战士盯着眼，
    怒火上心窝，
    连长一声命令下，
    山摇地动满天火。
    敌机被打中，
    烧成老蛤蟆，
    掉入海里喂王八，
    一条毒蛇下油锅……
    人们入梦乡，
    战士炮上坐，
    祖国领空最神圣，
    妖魔鬼怪逃不脱！
          慰问信
    我守卫在南海边，
    保卫美丽的春天，
    接到亲人的慰问信，
    张张是激情的诗篇。
    来自人民公社，
    来自工厂车间；
    丰产田里的勇士，
    织布机旁的姑娘……
    那豪迈的语句，
    像波涛在喧响，
    我的心血在沸腾，
    浑身充满力量！
    我用粗大的双手，
    把武器擦亮！
    那雄伟的炮口啊，
    守卫着天空和海洋！
      深夜的灯光……
    我挎上冲锋枪走出营房，
    接下了午夜的流动岗哨，
    人们都在被窝里做着甜梦，
    王团长的窗口还亮着灯光。
    我轻轻地走近玻璃窗口，
    贴着玻璃向里面张望——
    哟，王团长在学代数哪！
    烟蒂把桌上的烟碟塞满。
    看他那满额的皱纹，
    记载着走过的路程；
    看他那斑白的头发，
    经历过多少时代的风霜！
    如今，他又用刚强的毅力。
    向文化科学宣战！
    他的心是一堆不灭的篝火，
    就像这深夜的灯光。
      我在云涛里巡逻
    机场散发油香，
    马达日夜喧响，
    驾驶着国产的雄鹰，
    飞入苍茫的蓝天。
    刚披上北方的梅花雪，
    又闻到南国的椰林香；
    刚踏上东海的滔天浪，
    又冲过西南的高山巅……
    眼睛穿透密密层云，
    云里霹雷日夜轰响，
    伸手撒下满天鲜花，
    祖国到处是和平的春天。
    我在云涛里巡逻，
    万里长空挂在心间，
    一个空域就是一个哨位，
    一条云缝就是一个枪眼！
