    Eighth Route Army Fountain Pen and Birch Bark Letter
    Gù Gōng
    (1) This copper bullet shell once flew through the smoke of gunpowder, piercing the flags of the invading bandits. After the battle, the shell was collected; the commander, under the lamplight, carefully polished it and fitted a nib. From then on, the Eighth Route Army fountain pen was worn on the commander's chest, writing passionate battle songs, outlining red arrows of attack... The fountain pen accompanied the bayonet, writing heroic poems; wherever the commander's horse passed, good news flew to the blue sky!
    (2) The autumn wind blows through the birch forest, a charming scene; soldiers of the 359th Brigade write letters in the forest. Using birch bark as paper, reporting the good news of production; wheat waves roll like the sea, cotton bolls like clouds. The loess plateau of northern Shaanxi is filled with fragrance everywhere; soldiers and civilians work side by side, sowing golden seeds... The birch bark letter spreads its wings, making Nanniwan famous all over the world; the letter is passed down to this day, every word inspiring. The autumn wind blows through the birch forest, a charming scene; today, in the motherland, every family farms and cultivates the land.

    八路钢笔和桦皮信
    顾工（一）这枚铜壳子弹，曾经掠过硝烟，贼寇侵略大旗，都被纷纷射穿。战后打扫战场，弹壳装进弹袋；司令员灯下拂拭，精心装上笔尖。从此八路钢笔，佩在司令胸前；书写慷慨战歌，勾画进攻红箭……钢笔伴随刺刀，写下英雄诗篇；司令马蹄过处，捷报飞上蓝天！（二）秋风吹动桦林，一片迷人风景；三五九旅战士，林中挥笔写信。采用桦皮作纸，报告生产捷音；麦浪滚滚似海，棉絮朵朵如云。陕北黄土高原，到处弥漫芳馨；军民并肩播种，撒下粒粒黄金……桦皮信舒展双翅，南泥湾四海闻名；信件传到今天，字字鼓舞人心。秋风吹动桦林，一片迷人风景；如今祖国大地，家家点菜耕耘。
