Editor's note: This team, through meticulous work, established the production responsibility system on the basis of the commune members' conscious ideology, thus powerfully stimulating the commune members' enthusiasm for labor and making the team's production better and better.

How to implement the responsibility system in the production team? The first team of the Jiangshiwo Production Brigade in Baodi County, Hebei Province, provides a very good experience. This team has done a good job in implementing the production responsibility system, and has become the best production team in the county. More than 700 mu of crops are free of weeds, insects, and diseases, and are growing sturdily. Each early corn plant bears two or three large ears, which are about to ripen; the late corn is also as tall as a person, and is now tasseling and silking; the millet fields are golden, and the heavy ears are bending the stalks; the sweet potato vines have already covered the ground; and the 30 mu of waterlogged wasteland that could not be planted with crops in previous years has now been turned into green paddy fields.

Summarize Lessons and Establish a Responsibility System

This team has a total of 44 households, 75 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers, and 715 mu of cultivated land, with an average burden of 9.53 mu per laborer. Last year, this team did not implement the production responsibility system, production was not planned, quotas were not set for agricultural work, and the organization of labor was very poor. As a result, it became a production reduction team in the autumn. This lesson made Yang Baifang, the team leader, deeply realize the importance of strengthening labor management and implementing the production responsibility system. After the autumn harvest and wheat planting last year, the production team implemented the "three guarantees and one reward" to the team. Yang Baifang mobilized the commune members to summarize the experience and lessons of last year and formulated measures to increase production and a responsibility system for work groups. According to the opinions discussed by the commune members, all the laborers in the team were divided into three work groups. The work groups implemented a perennial "five fixed" responsibility system: 1. Fixed personnel. 2. Fixed land. According to the distance of the land, the high and low terrain, and the crop allocation, the responsibility area of each work group was rationally divided, and the work group was contracted year-round, from planting to harvesting, continuous operation, and management to the end. 3. Fixed livestock. According to the strength of the livestock, they were rationally allocated to the work groups, which were uniformly raised by the team and fixed for use by the groups. 4. Fixed farm implements. Large, medium, and small farm implements were all rationally matched and fixed for use by the groups. 5. Fixed leadership. In addition to electing a group leader to lead production in each work group, Yang Baifang and the other two deputy team leaders each contracted one group and were responsible for it from beginning to end throughout the year. Each work group also implemented "four determinations" (quantity, quality, time, and work points), and formulated a complete set of management methods such as work point evaluation, quality inspection, and over-quota rewards.

Close Integration of the Perennial Responsibility System and Collaboration

The implementation of a perennial fixed responsibility system must be combined with temporary shock tasks. This is the key to whether the responsibility system can be consolidated and implemented. In the past six months, this team has gradually explored the following rules from practice: 1. Production tasks are sometimes very concentrated and time-sensitive. For example, the harvesting, transportation, threshing, and rush planting in the summer harvest season must be completed by concentrating time and effort in collaboration, otherwise production will suffer losses. 2. The production of the responsibility areas of the work groups is different, and sometimes there is an uneven phenomenon of being busy and idle. For example, the first and second groups have more sorghum and less millet, and the third group has less sorghum and more millet. When the sorghum should be hoeed for the third time, there is not much work in the millet fields. 3. Temporary tasks that cannot be undertaken by the strength of one group must also be organized for collaboration. For example, the third group has 40 mu of late corn that needs to be thinned quickly, but at that time, there were only two people in this group who were good at thinning seedlings. Without organizing collaboration, the growth of the late corn would be affected. 4. When necessary, the production team should also transfer labor from the team to carry out large-scale collaboration between the teams. Facts have proved that it is not enough to have only a responsibility system without collaboration. The leadership responsibility of the team leader is to combine the responsibility system with collaboration.

How to organize collaboration? They have closely grasped the following points in organizing collaboration: First, when transferring group labor to organize collaboration, at the same time, help each group arrange its work so as not to affect the original plan of the group as much as possible. For example, after a heavy rain in mid-July, some low-lying areas accumulated water, and six people had to be transferred to drain water and rescue crops. The team leadership determined the number of people participating in drainage based on the size of the task of ridging sweet potatoes in the three groups, and helped the groups arrange ways to improve work efficiency, so that the original sweet potato ridging plan of each group was not affected. Second, when tasks between groups are unbalanced and collaboration is needed, take the method of adjusting tasks by the groups to avoid too frequent labor transfer and affect the persistence of the group responsibility system. When transplanting sweet potatoes, the first group had 20 mu of transplanting tasks, which was 8 mu more than the other two groups. The team transferred 6 mu of land from the first group to the second and third groups, and the first group allocated the work points that should be obtained by the second and third groups according to the quota, ensuring the timely completion of the overall transplanting plan. Third, organize collaboration in a unified way, establish temporary work groups, elect group leaders, and implement a temporary work group responsibility system. There are roughly two forms of the temporary production responsibility system: One is a shock task with many agricultural work items and a large scale of collaboration. The team organizes the commune members into different professional groups and implements assembly line operations. For example, during the summer harvest and summer planting, labor was transferred from each group to form professional groups for harvesting, transportation, rush planting, threshing, etc., which cooperated closely and quickly and well carried out rush harvesting and rush planting. For single collaborative agricultural work, the "four determinations" method of determining tasks, quality, time, and work points is implemented, and the collaborative group is responsible for it from beginning to end. After the shock task is completed, they return to their original work group. Fourth, when organizing collaboration, try to notify the work groups in advance so that the work groups can prepare and arrange production.

Integration of Long-term Plans and Short-term Arrangements

The close integration of long-term plans and short-term arrangements is the ingenious method of this team's leadership in the production responsibility system. Their method is: (1) Early start for everything, step by step in advance. When formulating plans, the team always advocates starting early, ahead of agricultural work, doing what is happening now, planning for the future, and looking two steps ahead for every step taken. This not only solves the contradiction of labor shortage during busy times, but also avoids labor idling during slack times. One month before this year's summer harvest, the team leader and the group leaders calculated the three accounts of tasks, labor, and time during the summer harvest and summer planting period. During the summer harvest period, hoeing, rush harvesting, and rush planting and other agricultural work had to be completed, but there was a shortage of more than 2,000 work points. In this way, the team organized the commune members to hoe the large fields three times before the wheat harvest, and applied topdressing fertilizer, and completed the summer planting before the wheat harvest through intercropping. After the summer harvest began, all the commune members concentrated their efforts and rushed to harvest 352 mu of wheat in seven days, and the wheat harvesting time was shortened by half compared with previous years. Because the summer hoeing and summer planting started early and gained the initiative, the spring seedlings and late seedlings did not experience seedling shortage, and the crops grew taller and more uniform. (2) One team of people, two sets of preparations. When implementing long-term plans and short-term arrangements, the team includes possible changes in the estimates, and does not fight unprepared battles. Each plan has two sets of arrangements: One is to consider the weather changes and ensure that there is work to be done in sunny and rainy days; the other is to allow the production team to draw people at any time to carry out emergency tasks. In this way, once a new situation arises, the people will not be chaotic and the plan will not fall through. In late June, the original plan was for 21 people to hoe 300 mu of late corn for the third time in five days, and for 33 people to transplant 30 mu of late sweet potatoes. However, it rained heavily the next day. Because the team leadership had prepared early, the people who were hoeing immediately turned to rushing to transplant sweet potatoes and replanting seedlings, and took advantage of the rain to complete the sweet potato planting and replanting tasks. After the weather cleared, they devoted themselves to hoeing, and the three tasks were still completed within five days according to the original plan. (3) Give the bottom line up and down, and implement the plan. When arranging production plans, the team cadres first give the plan to the commune members for discussion, and then find out the attendance ability of each person and each group's plan. They make arrangements every five days according to the different situations of each work group. In this way, the top and bottom have numbers, everyone knows the bottom line, which is easy to implement. In late July, field management was the most tense. According to the production team's deployment, the tasks of intertillage, weeding, and topdressing had to be completed in five days, requiring a total of 180 workdays. According to the current attendance capacity of the commune members, there was still a shortage of 25 workdays. The team cadres revealed this bottom line to the commune members, and the commune members all automatically increased their attendance plans. Eight auxiliary laborers and six students on vacation also automatically participated in the various work groups. As a result, labor changed from shortage to surplus, and the tasks were completed ahead of schedule. (4) Adapt to people and use labor skillfully. When arranging agricultural work each time, the team reasonably divides labor according to each person's physical strength and technical expertise, so that everyone can give full play to their talents. For example, the commune members with weak physical strength manage sweet potatoes, the women with ingenuity manage cotton, the elderly commune members manage vegetable gardens, the young and strong work hard on accumulating fertilizer and field management, and the auxiliary labor beats green grass and stores feed. In this way, each commune member can give full play to their strength.

Implement the Responsibility System and Put Politics First

When leading the commune members to implement the production responsibility system, this team attached great importance to political and ideological education. They regarded improving the commune members' ideological awareness and mobilizing everyone's enthusiasm for labor as a guarantee for implementing the production responsibility system. The method of this team in grasping political work is: organizing all the team members to carry out the "everyone strives for five goods (good thinking, good labor, good care of public property, good unity and cooperation, good learning of advanced technology), and every household strives for all red (all family members are five goods, that is, all red households)" competition, and adhere to the system of one small evaluation after each task is completed, one big evaluation per month, and one award per season. In the competition movement of everyone striving for "five goods" and every household striving for "all red", the team cadres used the method of grasping both ends and bringing the middle, inserting red flags and setting up pacesetters, and organizing everyone to learn. For example, in the youth, they organized the commune members to learn Sun Yuru's "working as fiercely as a tiger, taking the lead in all kinds of work"; the elderly learned Yu Haikuan's wisdom, meticulous work, and love for the commune as home; the women learned Zhang Baojin's ingenuity, unity and mutual assistance, and good communist style; the "all red family" took Sun Baochun's family of four laborers working full attendance every month as an example. Now, 55 commune members in the team have won the title of "five goods" commune members, and 38 households have won "all red". While grasping the advanced, they patiently persuade and educate the commune members who lack enthusiasm.

Strengthen Collective Leadership and Give Play to the Wisdom of the Masses

In the process of implementing the responsibility system, the team paid attention to giving play to the role of collective leadership. Team leader Yang Baifang and the two deputy team leaders each contracted a work group and met once a day to jointly arrange production; they also paid special attention to giving play to the role of the work group leaders. After the production is arranged, do not interfere with the group leaders. Do not take over everything within the group, and ensure that the top and bottom have duties and powers. In order to make the responsibility system better and more detailed, they also absorbed the core strength of each work group and organized an "old farmer staff department". The six "staff" members were all selected poor and lower-middle peasants, who had good ideas, were fair in handling affairs, were experienced in production, and had prestige among the masses. They were not only the "Zhuge Liangs" in the team who offered advice and suggestions, but also the capable assistants of the group leaders and the leaders in implementing the responsibility system. Each "staff" member also has a group of confidants around them. In this way, the top and bottom are of one mind, one force, and full of wisdom. For example, when the team proposed to transform the wasteland, the old staff member Yu Haikuan closely united Guo Zhiping, Yang Jiuquan and other four old farmers, and tried every means to drain the 30 mu of waterlogged wasteland that could not be planted with crops in previous years and planted japonica rice. Each team leader is not only a good commander in the team in promoting the responsibility system, but also a good pacesetter in implementing the responsibility system. They take the lead in all kinds of agricultural work and give everyone a good example. During this year's summer harvest, team leader Yang Baifang pulled wheat every day and exceeded the quota, and also watched the threshing ground and protected the wheat at night, leading the masses to do a good job in production.

Care for the Masses and Combine Work and Rest

When arranging production, the team often pays attention to arranging the rest and life of the commune members. They are especially concerned about the elderly and women commune members. When arranging work, they let the elderly do light work and go back earlier than the average commune members. The more they care about the masses, the more motivated the masses are. Once, they arranged 21 mu of millet weeding tasks for three women, stipulating that one person could only weed one mu per day at most; as a result, the three people completed the work of seven days in six days, and weeded three more mu without waiting for the leadership to allocate.

    加强劳动管理　搞好责任制度
    ——宝坻县江石窝生产队第一小队推行生产责任制的经验
    编者按：这个小队通过细致的工作，把生产责任制建立在社员自觉的思想基础上，因而有力地激发了社员的劳动积极性，使这个队的生产越搞越好。
    怎样在生产小队推行责任制？河北宝坻县江石窝生产队第一小队提供了很好的经验。这个小队生产责任制搞得好，成了全县生产最好的生产队。七百多亩庄稼块块做到无草、无虫、无病，生长茁壮。早玉米每棵结两三个大棒，快要成熟了；晚玉米也有一人来高，正在扬花吐穗；谷子地里一片金黄，沉甸甸的大穗子压弯了茎秆；甘薯地里薯蔓已经盖严了地皮；历年种不上庄稼的三十亩水荒洼子，今年也变成了绿油油的稻田。
    总结教训　建立责任制
    这个小队共四十四户，男女整半劳力七十五人，耕地七百一十五亩，每个劳力平均负担九点五三亩。去年这个小队没有实行生产责任制，生产没计划，农活没定额，劳动力组织很不好，结果秋季成了个减产队。这一教训，使小队长杨百芳深刻地认识到加强劳动管理、推行生产责任制的重要意义。去年秋收种麦结束后，生产队把“三包一奖”落实到小队，杨百芳就发动社员总结去年的经验教训，制订了超产措施和作业小组责任制度。根据社员们讨论的意见，把全小队劳力划成三个作业小组。作业小组实行常年“五固定”的责任制：一、固定人员。二、固定土地。根据土地远近，地势高洼，作物配植，合理划分每个作业小组的责任区，实行常年小组包工，由种到收，连续操作，一管到底。三、固定牲畜。根据牲畜强弱合理配置到作业小组，由小队统一饲养，小组固定使役。四、固定农具。大中小型农具都进行了合理搭配，小组固定使用。五、固定领导。每个作业小组除了选出小组长领导生产以外，杨百芳和其余两个副小队长每人包一个组，全年一包到底。各作业小组还实行“四定”（数量、质量、时间、工分），并订出评工记分、质量检查、超额奖励等一整套管理办法。
    常年责任制与协作密切结合
    实行常年固定责任制必须和临时突击任务相结合，这是能否巩固执行责任制的关键。半年来，这个小队从实践中逐步摸索到以下几点规律：一、生产任务有时非常集中而且时间性很强，比如夏收阶段的收割、运输、打场和抢种，必须集中时间，集中力量协作完成，否则就会使生产遭受损失。二、作业小组责任片的生产不同，有时出现忙闲不均的现象。例如，一、二小组高粱多、谷子少，三小组高粱少、谷子多，在高粱该锄三遍地时，谷子地里活不多。三、一个小组的力量担当不起来的临时性任务，也要组织协作完成。例如第三小组有四十亩晚玉米要迅速定苗，而当时这个小组的开苗能手只有两个人，不组织协作，就会影响晚玉米的生长。四、必要时生产队还要抽调小队劳力，进行小队之间的大协作。事实证明：只有责任制，没有协作，是不行的。小队长的领导责任，就是把责任制与协作结合起来。
    怎样组织协作？他们在组织协作时，紧紧抓住了以下几点：第一，在抽调小组劳力组织协作时，同时帮助各个小组安排好活计，尽量使小组原订计划不受影响。例如，7月中旬一次大雨后，有一部分洼地积水，要抽调六个人排水抢救作物。小队领导上就根据三个小组甘薯培埂的任务大小，确定参加排水的人数，并帮助小组安排好提高工效的办法，使各个小组的原订甘薯培埂计划没有受影响。第二，小组之间出现任务不平衡需要组织协作时，采取由小组调剂任务的办法，以避免劳力调动过于频繁，影响小组责任制的坚持。甘薯插秧时，第一小组有二十亩插秧任务，比其余两个小组多八亩，小队就由第一小组拨给二、三两个小组六亩地，第一小组按定额拨给二、三两个小组应得的工分，保证适时完成了全面插秧计划。第三，统一组织协作，建立临时作业小组，推选小组长，实行临时作业小组责任制。临时生产责任制大体有两种形式：一种是农活项目多、协作规模大的突击任务，小队把社员们组成不同的专业小组，实行流水作业。例如夏收夏种时，抽调各小组劳力分别组成了收割、运输、抢种、打场等专业组，分工协作，紧密配合，抢收抢种又快又好。单项协作的农活，就实行定任务、定质量、定时间、定工分的“四定”办法，由协作小组一包到底，突击任务完成后再回原作业小组。第四，组织协作时尽量提前通知作业小组，以便作业小组作好准备，安排生产。
    长计划与短安排结合
    长计划与短安排密切结合，是这个小队领导生产责任制的巧办法。他们的作法是：（一）一早百早，步步提前。小队在制定计划时，总是提倡早动手，赶在农活前头，做着现在的，计划将来的，走一步看两步。这既解决了大忙时劳力紧张的矛盾，又能避免小忙时劳力窝工。在今年夏收前一个月，小队长就和小组长们一起算好夏收夏种期间的任务、劳力、时间三笔账，夏收期间要完成锄地、抢收、抢种等农活，但缺二千多个工。这样，小队在麦收前就组织社员把大田普锄到三遍，并追上肥，把夏种也在麦收前通过套种办法完成了。夏收开始以后，全队社员就集中力量，七天抢收完三百五十二亩小麦，收麦时间比往年缩短了一半。由于夏锄、夏种动手早，争得了主动，春苗和晚苗没有发生苗荒现象，庄稼长的高一头黑一色。（二）一套人马，两套准备。小队在推行长计划短安排时，都是把可能发生的变化估计在内，不打无准备的仗，每个计划都有两套安排：一是考虑到天气变化，做到晴天、雨天都有活干；二是生产队布置紧急任务随时抽人突击。这样，一旦出现新情况时，人马不乱，计划不落空。6月下旬，原计划二十一个人五天把三百亩晚玉米锄完第三遍，三十三个人插完三十亩晚甘薯。但第二天就下了大雨，由于小队领导上早有准备，锄地的人马立即转入抢插甘薯和补苗，趁雨完成了甘薯栽种和补苗任务，天晴以后又全力投入锄地，三项任务仍按原计划在五天内全部完成了。（三）上下交底，计划落实。队干部们在安排生产计划时，把计划先交给社员讨论，然后再把每人每段的出勤能力，各小组的计划摸清，针对各个作业小组的不同情况五天作一次安排。这样，上下有数，人人底清，便于执行。7月下旬田间管理最紧张，按生产队的布置，五天要全部完成中耕、除草和追肥任务，共需用一百八十个劳动日。根据当前社员出勤能力，还差二十五个劳动日。队干部就把这个底亮给社员，社员们都自动地提高出勤计划，八名辅助劳力和六名放假的学生也都自动参加到各个作业小组，结果劳力由缺变余，提前完成了任务。（四）因人制宜，巧用劳力。小队在每次安排农活时，都根据每个人的体力强弱、技术专长合理分工，作到人尽其才。例如体力弱的社员管甘薯，妇女心灵手巧管棉花，老年社员管菜园，青壮年身强力壮搞积肥、田间管理，辅助劳力打青草贮饲料。这样，使每个社员都能充分发挥力量。
    实行责任制　政治要先行
    在领导社员们推行生产责任制时，这个小队十分重视政治思想教育工作，他们把提高社员思想觉悟，调动每个人的劳动积极性，作为执行生产责任制的保证。这个小队抓政治工作的方法是：组织全小队社员开展“人人争五好（思想好、劳动好、爱护公共财产好、团结协作好、学习先进技术好），户户争全红（全家成员都是五好即是全红户）”竞赛，并坚持每段任务完成后一小评，一月一大评，每季一发奖的制度。队干部们在人人争“五好”，户户争“全红”的竞赛运动中，运用了抓两头带中间的办法，大插红旗，大树标兵，组织大家学习。比如在青年中组织社员学习孙玉瑞的“干劲如猛虎，样样工作打前锋”；老年学习于海宽智谋多、干活细，爱社如家；妇女学习张宝金心灵手巧，团结互助，共产主义风格好；“全家红”以孙宝春全家四个劳动力月月出满勤为榜样。现在，全小队已经有五十五名社员荣获了“五好”社员的称号，有三十八户争得了“全家红”。在抓先进的同时，对于干劲不足的社员，他们都是耐心地说服教育。
    加强集体领导　发挥群众智慧
    小队在贯彻责任制的过程中，处处注意了发挥集体领导作用。小队长杨百芳和两个副队长每人包一个作业小组，每天碰一次头，共同安排生产；他们还特别注意发挥作业小组长的作用。生产安排好以后不乱抓小组长，凡是小组内的事情，不包办代替，做到上下有职有权。为了使责任制搞的更好、更细，他们还吸收各作业组的核心力量，组织了一个“老农参谋部”，六名“参谋”都是选拔的贫农下中农，思想好、办事公正、生产有经验、在群众中有威信的人。他们既是小队里出谋划策的“诸葛亮”，又是小组长的得力助手和执行责任制的带头人。每个“参谋”的周围也都有一批知心人。这样上下一条心，一股劲，智谋多。比如小队提出改造荒洼地时，老参谋于海宽就紧紧地团结了郭志平、杨久全等四名老农，把历年种不上庄稼的三十亩水荒洼千方百计排出水种上了粳子。每一个小队长不仅是小队里推动责任制的好指挥员，又是执行责任制的好标兵。他们样样农活带头干，给大家亮样板。今年夏收当中，小队长杨百芳拔麦天天超定额，晚上还看场护麦，带动群众搞好生产。
    关心群众　劳逸结合
    这个小队在安排生产时，经常注意安排社员休息和生活。他们对老年和妇女社员分外关心，在安排活计时，让老年人作轻活，比一般的社员晚去早回。越关心群众，群众的干劲就越足。一次，他们给三个妇女安排了二十一亩谷子的拔草任务，规定一人一天最多只拔一亩；结果三个人七天的活六天就干完了，没等领导上分配又拔了三亩。
