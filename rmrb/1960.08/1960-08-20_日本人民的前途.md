    The Future of the Japanese People
    Zhongdao Jianzang, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association

    The Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality has entered a new stage. The previous "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" was imposed on Japan by the United States in order to turn Japan into its "fortress." This is not "guaranteeing security" for Japan but is extremely dangerous. Due to the emergence of the new "Security Treaty," it has lost its effectiveness. However, the majority of the Japanese people do not recognize the Kishi Nobusuke group's forcible "ratification" of the new "Security Treaty." From the perspective of the reactionary regime's procedures, the new Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty seems to have "taken effect." But the Japanese people have expressed their opposition to this treaty through twenty-two unified actions and resolutely do not recognize this disgusting treaty. Therefore, even if it has been "established" in form, it has long been discredited among the people. At the same time, in this process, the Japanese people pursued Kishi Nobusuke, the mastermind behind the "ratification" of this reactionary treaty, and forced Eisenhower to cancel his visit to Japan. Eisenhower decided to visit Japan at Kishi Nobusuke's request, precisely to encourage Kishi Nobusuke.

    However, this struggle was conducted in a life-or-death state. Until the moment the Japanese government announced the cancellation of Eisenhower's visit to Japan on June 16, no one knew whether he could truly be forced to cancel his visit. At that time, we were continuing to discuss how we would express our will to resist U.S. imperialism if Eisenhower came to Japan. At the same time, the Kishi Nobusuke group mobilized a large number of police to set up cordons from Haneda Airport to Tokyo city, and also planned to deploy the "Self-Defense Forces." However, the heads of the police and the "Self-Defense Forces" knew the strength of the Japanese people better than Kishi Nobusuke. Despite the pressure exerted on them by the Kishi Nobusuke group and its backstage boss, the U.S. imperialists, it is said that they had no confidence in Eisenhower's security work and asserted that they could not be responsible for it, rejecting the demands of the Kishi Nobusuke group. The Kishi Nobusuke group, despairing of being rejected, was finally forced to abandon the idea of inviting Eisenhower. We only learned about such inside stories later.

    The one most directly hit by the cancellation of Eisenhower's visit to Japan was Kishi Nobusuke. Due to this failure, even the stubborn Kishi Nobusuke had to announce his resignation. However, Kishi Nobusuke struggled desperately to make the "ratification" of the new "Security Treaty" a fait accompli, as the price for his resignation. Although the new "Security Treaty" has been discredited, and although we have never recognized it, the victory of the Japanese people's movement to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" is insufficient in that we have never been able to prevent the "ratification" of the new "Security Treaty."

    Obviously, it was the united strength of the broad masses of the people that prevented Eisenhower from coming to Japan and overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. Although it is regrettable that the "ratification" of the new treaty was not prevented, the old treaty, which was just as dangerous as the new treaty, has expired as a result, and the new treaty has been met with unprecedented opposition from the people. Therefore, the Japanese reactionary forces and the U.S. imperialists who support them have suffered unexpected losses.

    Although the period of U.S. occupation of Japan has ended, the U.S. imperialists are still continuing to put pressure on the Japanese government, using reactionary comprador forces like Kishi Nobusuke to obstruct Japan's path to independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. They also want to separate the Japanese people from the people of Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world, and continue to hinder contact between the people. Before the plot to strengthen the Japan-U.S. military alliance failed, the U.S. imperialists did not dare to directly put pressure on the Japanese people, thinking that they only needed to control the comprador government of Japan. However, from now on, it will no longer be so easy for them to hinder the Japanese people from realizing their hopes. Because in front of the Japanese people, the common goal of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality has become clearer than in the past. Because the Japanese people know that to achieve this goal, in addition to disobeying the comprador regime, they must also rely on themselves to realize their hopes. The Japanese people not only overthrew the Kishi Nobusuke government, but are also prepared to unite and attack once the new cabinet reveals its blatant comprador nature. This situation is unprecedented in Japanese history. The illusion that U.S. military bases in Japan are for "defending" Japan has quickly disappeared from the minds of the Japanese people.

    Faced with the conscious actions of the Japanese people, the U.S. imperialists and the Japanese reactionary forces will collude more closely and frantically prevent Japan from taking the path of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. They are trying their best to win over those middle strata who have not yet awakened. They are doing everything in their power to urge the bureaucrats in power to suppress the actions of the awakened masses and undermine the unity of the people. The more disadvantageous the situation of all reactionary forces is, the more stubborn they become and the more they resort to violence. Whether in the national movement to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" or in the struggle of the workers at the Miike coal mine, the reactionary forces have attempted to use violence to oppress the workers and the masses of the people. However, at this time, the awakened Japanese people have clearly realized from the experience of resistance and victory that the reactionary forces are indeed at the end of their rope. Workers, housewives, professors, students, artists, and farmers have all begun to realize the enormous power of unity. The wavering middle strata, who make up the majority of the Japanese people, have begun to pay widespread attention to political issues. Therefore, it is difficult for the Japanese reactionary forces to blindly believe in power and use the masses of the people at will to realize their ambitions. This is the first time in Japanese history. The opposition between the reactionary forces and the awakened masses of the people is becoming increasingly sharp and prominent.

    The movement against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is, for the Japanese people, to do their best to put out a major fire. Because dangerous sparks have been sown, this fire has already begun to burn. In this struggle, the Japanese people know that they are not isolated. Today, the Japanese people have found that the encouragement given by the Chinese people and the warm support of the people of various countries suffering from U.S. imperialism is not only support, but also makes the Japanese people a member of a united team that is even broader than domestic unity. This discovery by the Japanese people must be what the reactionary forces fear most. The reactionary forces are plotting various conspiracies in an attempt to prevent the Japanese people from joining hands with the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe who are striving for independence, democracy, and peace, striving to get rid of imperialist control, and demanding the withdrawal of foreign military bases. However, the success of the Sixth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in Tokyo proves that their conspiracy has ended in failure.

    It can be said that Japan's democracy has begun to sprout vigorously in the current new stage. There was a period of history in Japan before democracy was established. In those years, the democratic movement was always suppressed by the reactionary forces. The unity of the Japanese people who attempted to open up the path to democracy was always wantonly undermined and isolated internationally. However, this struggle has proven to the Japanese people that "sovereignty rests with the people" is not just empty talk. There may be various twists and turns in the future, but Japan's new stage is indeed the dawn of democracy. It is futile for someone to try to stop the rising sun. Although there are still a few clouds on the horizon, this is a temporary phenomenon, and it is impossible to stop the arrival of dawn.

    In the past, we thought that if there were clouds, the sun could not shine on the earth. However, we don't think that way now. Without waiting for the success of spaceships, we can fly into the sky by plane, and we can still see the light of the sun above the clouds. The unity of the people of all countries who are fighting for independence, democracy, and peace allows us to look forward to the light of the sky that is not obscured by dark clouds.

### 日本人民的前途

    日本人民的前途
    日本中国文化交流协会理事长　中岛健藏
    日本人民争取独立、民主、和平和中立的斗争，进入了一个新的阶段。先前的“日美安全保障条约”，是美国为了把日本变成它的“堡垒”而强加给日本的。这对于日本来说，不是什么“保障安全”而是非常危险的东西。由于新“安全条约”的出现，它已经失去了效力。但是，日本国民的大多数是不承认岸信介集团强行“批准”新“安全条约”的。从反动政权的手续来看，新日美军事同盟条约似乎已经“生效”。但是日本国民通过二十二次统一行动表达了反对这一条约的意志，坚决不承认这个令人作呕的条约。因此，它即便在形式上已经“成立”，却早在人民中声名狼藉。同时，在这一过程中日本国民追击策划“批准”这一反动条约的主谋者岸信介，并且迫使艾森豪威尔取消访日之行。艾森豪威尔正是为了给岸信介打气，在岸信介的乞求下决定访问日本的。
    但是，这一斗争是在你死我活的状态下进行的。在6月16日日本政府宣布艾森豪威尔取消访日之行的一刹那之前，谁也不知道是否真正能够迫使他取消访日之行。当时，我们正在继续讨论如果艾森豪威尔一旦来到日本，我们将用什么方式来表明反抗美帝国主义的意志。与此同时，岸信介集团动员大批警察从羽田机场起直到东京市区布置警戒线，还计划出动“自卫队”。但是，警察和“自卫队”的负责人，对日本人民大众的力量比岸信介认识得清楚。尽管岸信介集团及其后台老板美帝国主义者对他们施加压力，据说他们对艾森豪威尔的警卫工作没有信心，并且断言对此不能负责而拒绝了岸信介集团的要求。岸信介集团因遭到拒绝而绝望，终于被迫放弃了邀请艾森豪威尔的念头。像这样的内幕，我们是后来才知道的。
    因艾森豪威尔取消访日之行而受到最直接的打击的是岸信介。由于这次失败，即使那样顽固的岸信介也不得不宣布下台了。但是，岸信介拼命挣扎使新“安全条约”的“批准”做到自然成立，以此作为下台的代价。虽然新“安全条约”已经声名狼藉，虽然我们始终不承认它，但是从没有能够阻止新“安全条约”的“批准”这一点说来，日本国民阻止修改“安全条约”运动的胜利是不充分的。
    显然，阻止艾森豪威尔来日和推翻岸信介内阁的，是广大人民的团结力量。虽然没有阻止新条约的“批准”是一件遗憾的事情，但是从结果看来，和新条约同样危险的旧条约已经失效，而新条约又遭到人民空前的反对。因此，日本反动势力和支撑它的美帝国主义者，遭受了预想不到的损失。
    尽管美国占领日本的时期已经终结，但美帝国主义者仍在继续向日本政府施加压力，利用岸信介那样的反动买办势力来阻塞日本走向独立、民主、和平和中立的道路。它并且要使日本人民脱离亚非及世界其他人民，继续阻碍人民之间的联系。在加强日美军事同盟的阴谋失败以前，美帝国主义者还不敢直接向日本人民施加压力，以为只要控制日本的买办政府就行了。但是，今后它已经不能如此轻易地妨碍日本人民实现自己的希望了。因为在日本国民的面前，独立、民主、和平和中立的共同目标已比过去更加明确了。因为日本人民深知要实现这一目标，除了不服从买办的政权以外，还必须依靠自己来实现自己的希望。日本人民大众不仅推翻了岸信介政府，而且准备好一旦新内阁暴露出露骨的买办性时就团结起来进行抨击。这种情况是日本历史上从来未有过的。以为美国在日本的军事基地是为了“保卫”日本的这一错觉，已经很快地在日本人的头脑中消失。
    面对着日本人民的自觉行动，美帝国主义者和日本反动势力将更加紧密地勾结起来，并疯狂地阻止日本走独立、民主、和平和中立的道路。它们极力想把那些尚未觉醒的中间阶层拉过去。它们竭尽全力督促掌权的官僚们压制已觉醒的人民大众的行动和破坏人民的团结。一切反动势力越是处境不利，就越是冥顽不化，越是采取暴力。无论对于阻止修改“安全条约”的国民运动或三池煤矿工人斗争，反动势力都企图用暴力来压迫工人和人民群众。但是，在这种时候，已觉醒了的日本人民从反抗和胜利的体会中已经清楚地知道反动势力确实陷于穷途末路。工人、家庭妇女、教授、学生、艺术家和农民都开始意识到巨大的团结力量。占日本国民中多数的摇摆不定的中间阶层，开始广泛地注意政治问题。因此，日本反动势力要想迷信权力随心所欲地利用人民群众来实现自己的野心是困难的。这在日本历史上是破天荒第一次。反动势力同觉醒了的人民大众之间的对立，日益尖锐而突出。
    反对日美军事同盟条约的运动，对于日本人民来说，就是要尽最大努力来扑灭一场大火。由于危险的火种已被撒下，这场大火已开始燃烧起来。在这场斗争中，日本人民知道自己并不是孤立的。今天，日本人民大众发现中国人民给予的鼓舞、受美帝国主义祸害的各国人民的热烈支持，不仅仅是支持，而且是使日本人民成为比国内团结更为广泛的团结队伍中的一员。日本人民的这一发现，一定是反动势力所最害怕的。反动势力正在策划种种阴谋，企图妨碍日本人民大众同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及欧洲那些争取独立、民主、和平，力求摆脱帝国主义控制和要求撤消外国军事基地的各国人民携起手来。但是，在东京召开的第六届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的成功，证明它们的阴谋以失败告终。
  日本的民主主义，在目前的新阶段可以说开始发出了茁壮的苗芽。在民主主义确立以前日本也有过一段历史。当年民主运动总是遭到反动势力的压制。企图开辟民主道路的日本人民的团结，总是遭到无端的破坏，而且在国际上被孤立起来。但是，这次斗争向日本人民证明，“主权在民”并不是空口念佛。今后可能还有种种曲折，但是日本的新阶段确实是民主的黎明。有人想阻止旭日东升是枉费心机的。虽然地平线上还有几片乌云，但这是暂时的现象，要想阻止黎明的到来是根本做不到的。
    我们过去以为一有云彩，阳光就不能照到大地上来。但是，现在不这样想了。用不着等待宇宙飞船的成功，乘飞机飞上天去，在云彩上面我们也照样可以看到太阳的光辉。选择独立、民主和和平的道路而斗争的各国人民的团结，使我们展望到不为乌云所蔽的天空的光明。　（本报特约稿）
