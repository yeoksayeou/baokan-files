Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 14th: The people in both urban and rural areas of the Shenyang region, Liaoning Province, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, are continuing flood prevention efforts while also intensifying the rush to harvest, plant, and manage autumn fields, striving for a double victory in flood control and production.

August is a tense period for flood control in the Shenyang area, and also a crucial juncture for striving for a bumper harvest of autumn crops. Before the occurrence of floods in the Hun River and other rivers, the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee and the Party committees of its nine counties and seven districts had already organized two headquarters for flood prevention and production, leading the broad masses of people to carry out flood prevention preparations on one hand and summer hoeing and production movements on the other. When the water level of the Hun River and some small and medium-sized rivers flowing through the Shenyang area rose sharply at the beginning of the month due to continuous heavy rainfall in the eastern part of Liaoning, the people in the city and countryside, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, immediately heightened and thickened the dikes of various rivers and reservoirs, and strictly strengthened defenses. When the Hun River situation became serious, in order to ensure Shenyang's safety, 100,000 troops and civilians from the city's Party, government, military, and civilian sectors fought day and night, generally raising the 23-kilometer-long Hun River dike by one meter, and overcoming this flood in the Hun River.

While fighting the Hun River flood, the members of the people's communes in various counties and districts of the Shenyang area also enthusiastically responded to the call of the Municipal Party Committee to "increase yields by one year's worth," and carried out late-stage management of autumn fields on the basis of eliminating three million mu of weed-filled fields. By August 5th, most of the rice in the city had been weeded once, 300,000 mu had been top-dressed with fertilizer, and more than 450,000 mu of soybeans had also been weeded. Suburban areas and Changtu, Xifeng, and Xinmin counties also seized the opportunity to rush-plant a lot of buckwheat and vegetables.

In order to lay the foundation for a greater agricultural harvest next year, all localities are actively accumulating and producing fertilizer in conjunction with flood prevention and field management work. Changtu County mobilizes more than 50,000 people and more than 5,000 large carts every day to massively compost green manure, composting more than 700 million catties in just a few days. In addition, all localities are seizing the opportunity of wild grass growth to actively collect and store various green silage feeds.

    一面防洪，一面狠抓收、种、管
    沈阳地区力争防洪生产双胜利
    新华社沈阳14日电　辽宁省沈阳地区城乡人民，在各级党委领导下一面继续防洪，一面狠抓抢收抢种和秋田管理，力争防汛、生产双胜利。
    8月份是沈阳地区防汛的紧张阶段，也是争取大秋作物丰收的紧要关头。在这次浑河等河流发生洪水以前，中共沈阳市委和所属九个县、七个区的党委，早就组织了防汛和生产两个指挥部，领导广大人民群众一边进行防汛准备，一边开展夏锄生产运动。当流经沈阳地区的浑河和一些中小河流，由于辽宁东部地区连降暴雨，在月初水位猛涨时，全市城乡人民，在各级党委领导下，立即加高培厚了各条河流和水库的堤坝，严密加强防守。当浑河水情严重时，为了确保沈阳安全，市内党政军民出动十万大军，昼夜奋战，使二十三公里长的浑河大堤，普遍加高了一米，战胜了这次浑河的洪水。
    在这次抗击浑河洪水的同时，沈阳地区各县、区人民公社社员，还热烈响应市委提出的“提高一成年景”的号召，在消灭三百万亩草荒田的基础上，作了秋田后期管理的工作。到8月5日，全市大部分水稻已拔完了一遍草，追肥三十万亩，有四十五万多亩大豆也拔了大草。郊区和昌图、西丰、新民等县还抓紧时机抢种了不少荞麦和蔬菜。
    为给明年农业更大丰收打下基础，现在各地结合防汛和田间管理工作，积极积肥造肥。昌图县每天出动五万多人和五千多台大车大沤绿肥，几天时间就沤出七亿多斤。另外，各地还抓紧野草丛生的时机，积极采集贮备各种青贮饲料。
