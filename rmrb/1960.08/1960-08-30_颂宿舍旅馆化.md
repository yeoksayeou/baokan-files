    Praising the Hotelization of Dormitories
    Zhu Wanyi, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Qinhuangdao Coking Plant
    Recently, the hotelization of collective dormitories has emerged in many factories, which is truly a heartening thing. Our factory has promptly promoted this work. Workers living in dormitories are just like living in hotels. Service personnel provide hot water, clean, do laundry, and tidy up the dormitories, making them clean and bright, with very neat luggage and bedding. People feel refreshed when they enter the room. Even in summer, there are no mosquitoes or flies in the room. It's no longer like the old days of "nails on the wall like stars, ropes crisscrossing, clothes and packages hanging all over the room." After work, workers can rest, entertain, read, and read newspapers at will, living comfortably and happily. If they want to buy something or handle some personal matters, the service staff can take care of it for them. Especially when they are sick, the service staff are like relatives, pouring tea and water, decocting medicine, and taking care of them meticulously.
    Yes, caring for the lives of the masses is the consistent policy of the Party. The Party Central Committee has repeatedly instructed us: the more energetic the masses are, the more the Party should care about their lives, and the more the Party cares about their lives, the more energetic the masses will be. In order to correctly implement these instructions, we must arrange the lives of the masses well, so that they can eat well, live well, and rest well. And the hotelization of dormitories is a good thing that has emerged under the leadership of the Party to care for the lives of the masses.

    颂宿舍旅馆化
    秦皇岛市焦化厂党委副书记　朱万义
    最近在许多地方的工厂里，出现了集体宿舍旅馆化，这确是一件深感人心的事情。我们厂及时地推广了这一工作。工人住在宿舍里，就跟住在旅馆里一样。服务员给打开水，打扫卫生，代洗衣服，把宿舍收拾得干干净净，窗明地光，行李被褥非常整洁。人们进得屋内，心情豁然开朗。虽在夏天，屋子里连一个蚊蝇也没有。再不像过去的“墙上钉，赛如星，横三竖四几道绳，衣服包裹满屋挂”那种面貌了。工人下班后，可以随便休息、娱乐、读书、看报。生活得既舒适，又快活。要想买些什么东西，或办一些个人私事，都可以由服务员代为办理了。特别是患有疾病的时候，服务员就像亲人一样，端茶倒水，煎汤煮药，照顾得无微不至。
    是的，关心群众生活，这是党的一贯方针。党中央曾经多次指示我们：群众的干劲越足，党越要关心群众生活，而党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲也就越足。为了正确地贯彻这些指示，就必须把群众的生活安排好，吃得好，住得好，休息好。而宿舍旅馆化就是在党领导下产生的一件关心群众生活的好事。
