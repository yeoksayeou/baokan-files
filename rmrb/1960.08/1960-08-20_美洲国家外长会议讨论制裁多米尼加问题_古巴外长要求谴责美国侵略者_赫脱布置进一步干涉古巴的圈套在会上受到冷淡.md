Xinhua News Agency, San José, 19th Dispatch: At the meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization of American States (OAS) member states on the 18th, when discussing Venezuela's accusation against the Dominican Republic for plotting to assassinate its president and demanding sanctions, the United States' conspiracy to use this issue to create a precedent for interfering in Cuba began to be clearly exposed.

During the meeting that day, when U.S. Secretary of State Herter spoke on this issue, he proposed a solution, stating that he disagreed with Venezuela's demand for severe sanctions against the Dominican Republic. Instead, he advocated that the OAS, controlled by the United States, send a "special committee" to the Dominican Republic to "supervise" the so-called "free elections" in the Dominican Republic. If the Dominican Republic refused to do so, the OAS would consider taking the "most effective measures" according to Article 8 of the Rio de Janeiro Treaty to make the Dominican Republic accept this suggestion. According to Article 8 of the Rio de Janeiro Treaty, these measures would include: using armed forces; severing diplomatic and economic relations; and severing all transportation and telecommunications links.

Herter openly declared that the significance of the actions proposed by the United States lies in: "clearly demonstrating that the OAS will effectively implement the principles it has adopted" and "maintain" the "legal system" within the Pan-American system prescribed by the United States. He also preposterously claimed that these actions would be a "contribution" to American "freedom" "in the future." Herter's remarks clearly foreshadowed that the United States would apply the precedent of dealing with the Dominican Republic to carry out vicious interference in Cuba. As early as the past few days, when the United States was vigorously peddling this plan to Latin American countries in private, Agence France-Presse had revealed that according to the United States' proposal, this "special committee" could send the OAS army, controlled by the United States, to the Dominican Republic. And this approach by the United States "could create a precedent that could become a serious warning to the Cuban government."

Herter's speech also exposed another conspiracy in the U.S. plan, namely, to firmly control the political situation in the Dominican Republic, suppress the national democratic struggle of the Dominican people, and maintain and strengthen U.S. rule through the "special committee," which it controls and which has supreme power that transcends national sovereignty. In this regard, Herter strongly demanded that the committee be given "the indispensable necessary powers, immunities, and rights to carry out its mission" in order to "supervise" "elections" and establish an American-style "representative democracy." Agence France-Presse pointed out in the same report that one of the "advantages" of the U.S. plan is that it can "guarantee the stability of the Dominican Republic" to prevent uprisings by the Dominican people. At the same time, it must be pointed out that holding so-called "free elections" "supervised" by the United States to establish a "representative democracy" is precisely a means that the United States has consistently attempted to use to subvert the Cuban revolutionary government.

Before the United States put forward its proposal, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Arcaya had already requested at the meeting on the 17th that severe sanctions, including the severance of diplomatic and economic relations, be imposed on the Dominican Republic according to Article 8 of the Rio de Janeiro Treaty, but excluding the "use of armed forces" stipulated in this article.

According to United Press International, Herter's proposal to establish a "special committee" may be opposed by some Latin American countries such as Mexico. On the other hand, Herter's remarks opposing severe sanctions against the Dominican dictator "did not actually win any applause" at the meeting.

Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa, in his speech, demanded that both the United States and the Dominican dictatorial regime be condemned as aggressors and sanctioned simultaneously. He also condemned the United States for not only "helping" the Dominican dictator Trujillo, but also "helping" former Venezuelan dictator Jiménez, former Colombian dictator Rojas Pinilla, and former Cuban dictator Batista. He said, "Justice demands that both the puppet (referring to the Dominican dictator) and his foster father (referring to the United States) be condemned." Roa said, "The Cuban delegation believes that sanctions against the Trujillo regime are urgently needed." However, "these sanctions should be all those that do not violate the principle of non-interference and the right to self-determination of the Dominican people." Roa also condemned U.S. aggression against Cuba.

### 美洲国家外长会议讨论制裁多米尼加问题  古巴外长要求谴责美国侵略者  赫脱布置进一步干涉古巴的圈套在会上受到冷淡

    美洲国家外长会议讨论制裁多米尼加问题
    古巴外长要求谴责美国侵略者
    赫脱布置进一步干涉古巴的圈套在会上受到冷淡
    新华社19日讯　圣约瑟消息：在美洲国家组织成员国外长会议18日讨论委内瑞拉控诉多米尼加共和国谋刺它的总统并要求予以制裁的问题时，美国利用这个问题制造先例来干涉古巴的阴谋开始清楚地暴露出来。
    美国国务卿赫脱在这一天会议上发言时就这个问题提出一项解决方案，他表示不同意委内瑞拉关于对多米尼加进行严厉制裁的要求，但是却主张由美国一手控制的美洲国家组织派遣一个“特别委员会”前往多米尼加，去“监督”多米尼加举行所谓“自由选举”，如果多米尼加拒绝这样做，就由美洲国家组织根据里约热内卢公约第八条，考虑采取“最有效的措施”，来使多米尼加接受这项建议。根据里约热内卢公约第八条的规定，这些措施将包括：使用武装力量；断绝外交、经济关系；断绝一切交通和电讯往来。
    赫脱公然宣称，美国建议采取的行动所具有的重要意义在于：“清楚地表明，美洲国家组织将有效地实施它所通过的原则”和“维持”美国所规定的泛美体系中的“法律制度”。他并且胡说这些行动“在将来”将成为对美洲“自由”的一种“贡献”。赫脱的这番话显然预示着美国将搬用对待多米尼加的先例来对古巴进行凶恶的干涉。早在过去几天中美国极力在私下向拉丁美洲国家兜售这项计划时，法新社就曾经透露，根据美国的这项建议，这个“特别委员会”可以派遣由美国控制的美洲国家组织的军队到多米尼加去。而美国的这种做法“可以造成一个可能成为对古巴政府的严重警告的先例”。
    赫脱的发言还暴露了美国这项计划中的另一个阴谋，即通过由它控制的、具有超越国家主权的无上权力的“特别委员会”，来牢牢控制多米尼加的政局，镇压多米尼加人民的民族民主斗争，保持和加强美国的统治。在这方面，赫脱极力要求赋予这个委员会以“执行任务的不可少的必要的权力、豁免权和权利”，以便通过它来“监督”“选举”和确立美国制的“代议民主制”。法新社在同一条消息中曾经指出，美国这项计划的“优点”之一就是：可以“保证多米尼加的稳定”以防止多米尼加人民的起义。同时必须指出，举行由美国派人“监督”的所谓“自由选举”来确立“代议民主制”，也正是美国一贯企图用来颠覆古巴革命政府的一种手段。
    在美国提出它的建议以前，委内瑞拉外交部长阿卡亚在17日举行的会议上，已经要求根据里约热内卢公约第八条对多米尼加进行包括断绝外交和经济关系的严厉制裁，但是排除这项条款中规定的“使用武装力量”这一点。
    据合众国际社报道，赫脱提出的关于建立一个“特别委员会”的建议可能遭到墨西哥等一些拉丁美洲国家的反对。而另一方面，赫脱关于反对严厉制裁多米尼加独裁者的发言在会议中“实际上没有博得任何掌声”。
    古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚在发言中，要求同时谴责美国和多米尼加独裁政权为侵略者，并且同时对它们进行制裁。他还谴责美国不仅“帮助”多米尼加独裁者特鲁希略，而且“帮助”前委内瑞拉独裁者希门尼斯、前哥伦比亚独裁者罗哈斯·皮尼亚和前古巴独裁者巴蒂斯塔。他说，“正义要求同样谴责傀儡（指多米尼加独裁者）和他的养父（指美国）”。罗亚说，“古巴代表团认为对特鲁希略政权进行制裁是刻不容缓的”。但是，“这些制裁应该是所有那些不违反不干涉原则和多米尼加人民自决权的制裁”。罗亚还谴责美国侵略古巴。
