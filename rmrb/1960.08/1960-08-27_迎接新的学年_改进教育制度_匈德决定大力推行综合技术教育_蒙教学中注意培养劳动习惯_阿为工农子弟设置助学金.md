Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, August 26th - In the new academic year of 1960-1961, Hungary's education will have significant development, and the policy of combining teaching with productive labor will be further implemented. Currently, all school-age children in Hungary are able to attend school.

In the new academic year, another five hundred primary schools will begin to implement the comprehensive technical education system. This will bring the total number of primary schools implementing this system nationwide to fifteen hundred, with two hundred thousand students (from grades five to eight) receiving comprehensive technical education, accounting for approximately 70% of the total number of students in advanced classes. In the capital, Budapest, this proportion has already reached 77%.

Currently, six hundred and thirty-three classes in middle schools across the country are implementing the "five plus one" system, meaning five days of classes a week and one day of labor in factories or rural areas. After the start of the new academic year, another one hundred and thirty-three middle schools will promote this system. Last year, five schools began experimenting with a teaching method of three days of classes and three days of labor in factories. This year, the "three-three" system will be expanded to thirty-three middle schools.

In order to gradually solve the learning problems of young people who do not continue to middle school after graduating from primary school, the state has also vigorously developed two-year industrial and agricultural technical schools.

When enrolling new students this year, colleges and universities continue to give priority to young people who have participated in practical labor and have work experience. In the new academic year, political and ideological education for college students will be further strengthened, and the duration of students' production internships will also be correspondingly increased.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 26th - According to a report by the German News Agency: Lorenz, State Secretary of the Ministry of National Education of the German Democratic Republic, told this news agency that in the upcoming 1960-1961 new academic year, the number of students in ten-year comprehensive technical schools will account for 80% of the total number of primary and secondary school students; by 1964, the country will fully implement ten-year comprehensive technical education.

Lorenz also pointed out that the state has consistently given great care to education, and this year, the scholarships received by secondary school students will reach 44 million marks.

The German Democratic Republic began implementing ten-year comprehensive technical education in 1958. Before this, ordinary schools were eight-year schools.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, August 25th - According to local newspapers: Schools at all levels in the Mongolian People's Republic are making final preparations for the 1960-1961 academic year.

In the new academic year, schools at all levels will pay attention to cultivating students' labor habits, organizing students to participate in labor, and carrying out in-depth cultural campaigns.

The Mongolian "Truth Daily" recently stated in an editorial on the tasks of the new academic year that in the new academic year, classroom education should be closely linked with the creative labor and practical struggles of the broad working people in building the socialist motherland, and attention should be paid to enabling students to acquire knowledge that combines theory with practice. The editorial requires middle schools to set up laboratories for chemistry, physics, carpentry, ironworking, and other courses; experimental fields should be set up in primary and secondary schools according to the students' curriculum, and students should be organized to participate in the motherland's industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production, and various groups such as literature, art, and sports should be organized so that they can receive physical and aesthetic education. The editorial also calls for organizing students to participate in social welfare activities, participate in cultural campaigns carried out in various places, and implement a civilized lifestyle in schools and among students; it requires all teachers and students to work and study according to the good example of "learning, laboring, and living in a socialist way."

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 26th - Schools at all levels in Albania are actively preparing to welcome the new academic year.

This year, the number of students in Albania will reach 300,000, an increase of 40,000 from last year. Forty-eight seven-year schools and four middle schools will be added in various places. This year, 1,420 children of working people across the country will continue to enter colleges and universities after graduating from middle school. In order to enable the children of workers and peasants to attend middle school, the state has specifically set up more than 2,300 scholarship quotas and 750 half-scholarship quotas.
