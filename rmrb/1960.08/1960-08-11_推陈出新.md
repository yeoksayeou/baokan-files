The new historical Peking opera "Man Jiang Hong" is now performing the scene where Yue Fei generously sacrifices himself, unyielding to the death, which is the climax of the entire play.

Yue Fei (played by young actor Sun Yue) regards death as going home and is calm and composed, reciting his oath poem with tragic grandeur: "Successive generations advance, return my rivers and mountains," followed by the majestic singing of "Man Jiang Hong." For about two minutes thereafter, a rare extended "silent performance" appears on the stage in Peking opera: Yue Fei has no singing, no dialogue, and very few movements; he stands erect, glaring at the treacherous officials, like a dignified and awe-inspiring "statue" of justice. The audience's gaze unanimously intersects with Yue Fei's bright and piercing eyes. In the high-pitched and magnificent singing, the red light illuminates this patriotic hero, making him appear even more solemn and respectful. All of this completely overwhelms the treacherous officials and clowns cowering in the corners of the stage. The curtain closes abruptly, and thunderous applause suddenly erupts from the audience that has been holding its breath for a long time.

This play removes the tragic and somber tone of the old Peking opera "Fengbo Pavilion" and the dross of portraying Yue Fei as foolishly loyal. Based on historical truth, it exposes the Jin army's conspiracy of negotiating peace with one hand and preparing for war with the other, highlighting Yue Fei's and the broad masses' heroic spirit of resolutely resisting aggression. The young actors of the Fourth Troupe of the China Peking Opera Theatre, who participated in the performance, have an average age of only twenty-something, which posed a great challenge for them.

However, they were not afraid of difficulties. They studied materials, sought opinions, and finally broke the superstition of adhering to only one school. They comprehensively applied the characteristics of the Tan, Yu, and Qi schools, such as roundness, correctness, and tragic and passionate tones, to design a singing style and movements suitable for Yue Fei's identity. Sun Yue originally studied civil old male roles, and martial arts student Yu Dalu enthusiastically helped him design martial arts and dance movements. Every role, every action, every gesture, every step, is the result of the actors' individual painstaking deliberation and the collective wisdom of the entire troupe.

This Peking opera troupe, composed entirely of young actors, has performed new historical dramas such as "The Yang Family Women Generals" and "First Ventures from the Thatched Cottage" since this year, and has begun to establish a new style that is full of vitality and courage to forge ahead.

    推陈出新
    京剧新历史剧“满江红”正演到岳飞慷慨就义、宁死不屈的一场，这是全剧的高潮。
    岳飞（青年演员孙岳饰）视死如归、泰然自若，悲壮地念着誓诗：“前仆后继，还我河山”，气势磅礴的“满江红”歌声随之而起。在此后大约两分钟里，舞台上出现了京剧中少见的长时间“无言表演”：岳飞没一句唱词、一句念白，动作很少；他挺胸矗立，怒视奸佞，好似一具正义凛然的“雕像”。观众的视线不约而同地和岳飞那炯炯有神的目光交射在一起。在高亢雄伟的歌声中，红光灯照射着这位爱国英雄，显得更加庄严、肃穆。这一切，完全淹没了震蹑在舞台角落上的奸臣和小丑。幕急闭，屏息已久的观众席上骤然爆发出雷动的掌声。
    这出戏去掉了京剧老“风波亭”中悲惨低沉的格调和表现岳飞愚忠等糟粕，根据历史真实，揭露金兵一手讲和、一手备战的阴谋，突出了岳飞和广大人民坚决反抗侵略的英雄气概。参加演出的中国京剧院四团青年演员平均年龄只二十几岁，这给他们出了个大难题。
    可是，他们不怕难，他们研究资料、征求意见，终于破除只拘一派的迷信，综合运用谭、余、麒等派腔圆、字正、悲壮激越等特点，设计出适合岳飞身份的唱腔和身段。孙岳原学文老生，武生俞大陆就热情帮他设计武功和舞蹈动作。每个角色、每个动作，一举手，一投足，都是演员个人苦心揣摩同全团集体智慧的结晶。
    这个全部由青年演员组成的京剧团，今年以来已经演出了“杨门女将”、“初出茅庐”等新历史剧，开始树立起一种生气勃勃、勇于进取的新风格。
