There was a young woman named Wang Peizhen, a student at Tianjin No. 7 Girls' Middle School. She graduated from high school in 1957 and, in response to the Party's call, went to the countryside to participate in agricultural production and train herself, determined to become a new-style peasant. This girl was full of ambition and happiness, but her parents strongly disagreed. "Silly girl, don't be willful! You should think twice about this! Look at the good life in the city, why do you have to go to the countryside?" She persuaded her parents three times and went to Tuanbowacun Village in Jinghai County. Although she was not used to the life at first, her determination did not waver in the slightest. She rushed to do any hard work, and Wang Peizhen was always there for any dirty work. In agriculture, she learned skills by taking peasants as her teachers; in culture, she took on the role of a voluntary teacher. As she grew accustomed to the work, she established a deep affection with the villagers. The villagers were afraid that she would leave and joked with her to find out. They said, "A rabbit's tail can't grow long. Once you have a boyfriend, you'll run back to Tianjin!" Wang Peizhen replied with a smile, "I am a person of Tuanbowacun as long as I live!" She thought: It's not enough to just say it, I have to take practical actions to prove it. Wang Peizhen performed well in hard work, and she was a representative at the district's meeting of activists. At the meeting, she was rewarded by the district committee. She was overjoyed to receive a large iron shovel. Speaking of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, young people and women took the lead, responding to the Party's call to cultivate experimental fields, determined to greatly increase production. The village formed a women's team of fifteen people, with Wang Peizhen as the captain; the Youth League also organized a youth team, with Zhao Fuping as the captain. The two teams jointly ran a farm, setting up camp in the fields with their luggage. The young men and women were highly motivated, competing in production. They chased and surpassed each other in the Great Leap Forward, helping and caring for each other. When smoking fertilizer, the young men helped the girls build the kiln, and the girls helped the young men sew their clothes diligently. From then on, Peizhen and Fuping were often together, working, laboring, and studying together. She loved him for his simplicity and sincerity, his hard work and love of learning, and his admirable character; he had ways to lead production and was very serious about the work of the League. Fuping also loved Peizhen, but he was afraid that the high school student would not love a peasant. The two were secretly in love but did not reveal it, and their mutual assistance plan was already being implemented. Zhao Fuping taught Peizhen how to transplant seedlings, and Wang Peizhen taught Fuping to study language. The leaders were very happy to see this, and the villagers were also talking about it. Some said, "This girl keeps her word. It looks like she is really settling down here." Once, Wang Peizhen went home and told her parents about her feelings. Her mother said, "Our daughter is grown up, you can make your own decisions," but her father firmly opposed it. He said, "Although Fuping's character is good, without culture, he will not have a good future." Wang Peizhen argued with a flushed face, she said, "Dad's words are not right. Without culture, we can learn. The working people must be the masters of culture. …To build communism, we work together. Is there any better future than this?" Wang Peizhen was determined, her love for Fuping would never change! The two were in love, and they both made their ideals clear. They both were determined to be good children of the Party, and they both wanted to be agricultural scientists who were both red and expert. Wang Peizhen gloriously joined the Party in 1959, and their love deepened. In 1959, they celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. On this day, Peizhen and Fuping got married. The men and women, old and young, in the village all came to congratulate them, praising the hero and heroine, a good pair of newlyweds! This is a passage from Wang Peizhen's marriage in the countryside, new people and new things in new China are spread everywhere.

    王培珍农村安家（唱词）
    易和元有一个女青年名叫王培珍，她本是天津女七中一名学生，1957年她高中毕了业，响应党的号召要到农村，参加农业生产锻炼自己，决心要做一个新式农民。这姑娘雄心壮志满怀高兴，却谁知她的父母亲大不赞成，“傻闺女做事莫任性，这件事应当要三思而行！你看这城市生活哪些不好？为什么偏偏要去到农村？”她三番五次说服了父母，去到了静海县团泊洼村。虽说是刚来生活不习惯，可是决心没动半毫分。什么活累她就抢着干，什么活脏就有王培珍。农业上她拜农民为师学本领，文化上义务教员她担在身。一日生来三日熟，她与社员们建立了深厚感情。社员们都怕她要走，对她说说笑话问分明。他们说：“兔子尾巴长不了，有了对象你就要跑回天津！”王培珍笑着把话答：“我活着就是团泊洼的人！”她心想：嘴里说了还不算数，我要拿出实际行动来证明。王培珍艰苦劳动表现好，区里召开积极分子会她是代表一名，在会上她受到区委奖励。一张大铁锨她拿着欣喜万分。话说1958年大跃进，青年、妇女作先行，响应党的号召把试验田搞，一心要把生产成绩大添增，村里成立了十五人的妇女队，队长就是王培珍；青年团也组织了青年队，队长叫做赵福平。两队合把一个农场办，带着行装田间扎下了营。男女青年劲头高，生产竞赛比输赢。你追我赶齐跃进，互相帮助互关心。熏肥时小伙子帮姑娘们把窑建，姑娘们帮小伙子缝补衣裳费辛勤。从此后培珍、福平经常在一起，工作、劳动、学习两不分。她爱他为人朴实又诚恳，勤劳动爱学习人品可亲；领导生产有办法，团的工作很认真。福平也把培珍爱，却怕的是高中生不会爱农民。两个人暗中相爱且不表，互助计划早已在执行。赵福平教培珍把秧来插，王培珍教福平学习语文。领导上见此情都很高兴，社员们也都在议论纷纷。有人说：“这姑娘说话真算数，看起来她要在这里真正安身。”王培珍有一次回到家去，把心事告诉了父亲母亲，母亲说：“闺女大了，主意你自己拿定”，父亲却坚决反对不赞成。他说道：“福平人品虽然好，没有文化他就没有好前程。”王培珍面红耳赤来争论，她说道：“爸爸的话儿不中听，没有文化可以学，劳动人民一定要当文化的主人。……建设共产主义我们共同努力，除了这还有什么别的好前程。”王培珍主意定，她爱福平天长地久不变心！两个人相亲又相爱，两个人都把理想说分明，两个人都决心要做党的好儿女，两个人都要做农学家红透专深。王培珍1959年又光荣参加了党，两个人的爱情深上加深。1959年庆祝建国十年大庆，这一天培珍福平结了婚。村里男女老少都来祝贺：都称赞男英雄女模范好一对新人！这就是王培珍农村成亲书一段，新中国新人新事到处传闻。
