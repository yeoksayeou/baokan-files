    Focusing on Key Points Means Focusing on the Overall Situation
    Wang Pu
    The attitude taken towards steel, coal, ore, and transportation is an important indicator of whether an enterprise or an individual possesses a global perspective. Prioritizing the task of supporting steel, iron, coal, ore, and transportation and striving to complete it by every possible means demonstrates a global perspective. Placing them below general tasks or treating them on par with general tasks indicates a lack of a global perspective or a weak global perspective.
    Why is this the case? Because steel is the primary "grain" of industry and also the primary "grain" for agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification. Chairman Mao said, "With grain and steel, everything becomes easier." Steel and grain determine the development speed of the entire national economy, as repeatedly proven by the Great Leap Forward in the past decade, especially since 1958. Coal and ore, in turn, are the "grain" of steel, and transportation is essential for ensuring the production of steel, iron, coal, and ore. Each ton of increased steel production requires an increase of several tons of coal and ore, and an increase of several tons of transportation volume. This has also been proven by the Great Leap Forward in the past decade, especially since 1958. In other words, the development speed of steel, iron, coal, ore, and transportation determines the lifeline of the development speed of the entire national economy. Concentrating efforts on grasping coal, ore, iron, and transportation to promote the great development of steel means grasping the main key to the "national chessboard." Starting from the needs of steel, iron, coal, ore, and transportation means starting from the overall situation, and serving steel, iron, coal, ore, and transportation means serving the "national chessboard."
    To truly start from the overall situation and from key points, we must work together to first focus on key projects, key products, and key enterprises. The workers of enterprises burdened with the important task of transferring pig iron, coal, and ore must, in terms of quantity, quality, and timeliness, first ensure the needs of increased production in key steel enterprises. The workers of transportation departments must prioritize the transportation of materials needed for increased production of steel, iron, coal, and ore. The workers of machinery manufacturing enterprises must use available materials and technical strength to first produce mining equipment, transportation equipment, and farmland irrigation and drainage equipment; furthermore, they must strengthen collaboration to produce and supply complete sets of equipment. All basic construction projects and production tasks must be treated differently according to their importance and urgency. We must not treat key points as general, and even less treat general as key. Materials, equipment, and labor should also be allocated and transferred according to this principle. If everyone is of one mind and exerts one force, concentrating superior forces and aiming at the main goals, completing one batch before working on another, then we can accelerate the process of socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    The practice of Yangquan City is a good example. Starting from the overall situation, properly positioning all sectors, and concentrating efforts to first complete key projects and products is an important task for us at present.

    为重点就是为全局
    王朴
    对钢铁、煤炭、矿石和运输，采取什么样的态度，是当前衡量一个企业、一个人有没有全局观点的一个重要标志。把支援钢、铁、煤、矿、运的任务，摆在第一位，千方百计地去完成的，就是有全局观点；把它们摆在一般任务之下，或者跟一般任务平列起来，就是没有全局观点，或者全局观点不强。
    为什么呢？因为钢铁是工业的主要“粮食”，也是农业机械化、水利化、电气化的主要“粮食”。毛主席说：“一个粮食，一个钢铁，有了这两个东西就什么都好办了。”钢铁和粮食决定着整个国民经济的发展速度，这已经为过去十年，别是1958年以来的大跃进事实所一再证明的了。而煤炭和矿石，又是钢铁的“粮食”，运输是保证钢、铁、煤、矿石生产所必需的，每增产一吨钢，就需要增产好几吨煤和矿石，需要增加好几吨运输量，这也是为过去十年，特别是1958年以来的大跃进事实所证明了的。也就是说，钢、铁、煤、矿、运的发展速度，是决定着整个国民经济发展速度的命脉的。集中力量抓煤、矿、铁、运，以促进钢的大发展，就是抓住了全国一盘棋的主要关键。从钢、铁、煤、矿、运的需要出发，就是从全局出发，为钢、铁、煤、矿、运服务就是为全国一盘棋服务。
    要真正从全局出发，从重点出发，就要同心协力首先围绕着重点工程、重点产品、重点企业转。肩负外调生铁、煤炭、矿石等重任的企业的职工们，要按量、按质、按时地首先保证重点钢铁企业增产的需要。交通运输部门的职工们，增产钢、铁、煤、矿需要什么物资，就优先运输什么物资。机械制造企业的职工们，有材料，有技术力量，要首先用来生产矿山设备、运输设备、农田排灌设备；而且要加强协作，成套生产，成套供应。一切基本建设项目和生产任务，都要根据轻重缓急，分别对待。既不能以重点当作一般，更不能以一般当作重点。材料、设备、劳动力，也要按照这个原则进行分配和调拨。如此人人一条心，一股劲，集中优势兵力，对准主要目标，干完一批再干一批，那我们就可以又多又快又好又省地加速社会主义建设的进程。
    阳泉市的做法，是个很好的榜样。从全局出发，摆好各行各业的位置，集中力量首先完成重点工程和产品，这是我们当前的一项重要任务。
