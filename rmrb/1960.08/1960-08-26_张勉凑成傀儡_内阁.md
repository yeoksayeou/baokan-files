Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 24th: Seoul dispatch: Zhang Mian, the loyal running dog of the United States and puppet "Premier" of South Korea, barely managed to put together a "cabinet" of fourteen members yesterday. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Seoul, ten of the fourteen ministers in the new cabinet belong to Zhang Mian's Democratic Party "New Faction."

During Zhang Mian's efforts to put together this "cabinet," the Democratic Party's "New Faction" and "Old Faction," which had fiercely competed for the position of "Premier," once again engaged in intense infighting. The "Old Faction," led by Kim Do-yeon, who was defeated in the struggle for the puppet "Premier" position, threatened to organize a separate political group within the "National Assembly" to resist the meetings convened by Zhang Mian to organize the "cabinet," threatening to split from the "New Faction" and become an "opposition party," and would try to oust Zhang Mian and his cabinet, refusing to participate in the "cabinet" pieced together by Zhang Mian several times.

    张勉凑成傀儡“内阁”
    据新华社平壤24日电汉城消息：美国的忠实走狗、南朝鲜伪“总理”张勉，在昨天勉强拼凑起一个由十四人组成的“内阁”。据美联社的汉城报道，新内阁的十四个部长中，有十个属于张勉的民主党“新派”。
    在张勉拼凑这个“内阁”时，曾经激烈争夺“总理”职位的民主党“新派”和“旧派”又一次展开了猛烈的倾轧。在争夺伪“总理”职位中被击败了的以金度演为首的“旧派”，扬言要在“国会”内组织一个单独的政治集团，抵制张勉为组织“内阁”而召开的会议，威胁要同“新派”分裂而成为“反对党”，并将设法把张勉同他的内阁撵下台来，先后数次拒绝参加张勉拼凑的“内阁”。
