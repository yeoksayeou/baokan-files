Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 26th. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today, pointing out that "U.S. imperialism, unwilling to accept its defeat, is doing everything possible to help the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group undermine the achievements of the Lao people, plotting to drag Laos back to the old road of being an appendage of U.S. imperialism."

The commentary, entitled "Be Vigilant Against the Destructive Activities of U.S. Imperialism and Its Lao Lackeys," pointed out that "according to foreign news, U.S. imperialism has allocated more than 100,000 U.S. dollars to help Phoumi Nosavan prepare to use force to resist the coup committee and the Souvanna Phouma government. Vientiane Radio revealed on August 23rd that the Thai government allowed two battalions of Phoumi Nosavan's troops to pass through Thailand from Savannakhet to North Sane County to prepare to attack Vientiane. The Phoumi Nosavan group is also attempting to force the Phouma government to make concessions politically."

The commentary pointed out that the Lao people are once again facing serious sabotage by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. This destructive behavior is exactly the same as their behavior in mid-1958 to overthrow the Lao coalition government, which was participated in by the Lao Fighting Forces and also headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister. Past experience and the current conspiracies and actions of U.S. imperialism remind the Lao people and the Lao patriotic and progressive forces that they must be vigilant and strengthen unity to defeat these conspiracies and actions."

The commentary said that rallies held in Sam Neua, Phongsaly, Xieng Khouang and other places, attended by tens of thousands of people, demanded that the coup committee and the Phouma government take a firm attitude towards the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group. Many soldiers in Phoumi Nosavan's army resisted the order to march on Vientiane. The commentary pointed out that all this shows that the people of all strata in Laos have a strong will to struggle for the realization of genuine peaceful neutrality and a policy of national harmony.

The commentary said, "In order to fulfill the obligation to safeguard the Geneva Agreement on Laos and to defend peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, the Vietnamese people strongly condemn and resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist acts of interference in Laos' internal affairs, and resolutely support the Lao people's anti-American and national salvation struggle."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 26th. "Democratic Korea" published a commentary today, welcoming the Lao new government's policy of peace and neutrality, and strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys for preparing an armed intervention in Laos.

The commentary said that the Korean people believe that the Souvanna Phouma government's declared policy of pursuing peace and neutrality and fulfilling the Geneva and Vientiane agreements will undoubtedly stabilize the situation in Laos and contribute to consolidating peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The commentary said: At present, the U.S. imperialist aggressors are showing their fangs even more fiercely, frantically challenging the people of all countries and world peace. The U.S. ruling clique blatantly opposes the new government of Laos and its policies, and its kept press openly incites the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization group to armed intervention in Laos. The Phoumi Nosavan group, with the support and instigation of U.S. imperialism and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, is preparing an armed attack on Vientiane. However, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are digging their own graves.

The commentary said that the Korean people, together with the Lao people, will never allow the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, who are undermining peace in Laos and Asia, to commit acts of aggression against Laos. No conspiracy of U.S. imperialism can stop the Lao people from moving forward.

    越南“人民报”支持老挝人民反美救国斗争
    谴责美国策划武装干涉老挝政局
    “民主朝鲜报”揭露美国和东南亚集团支持诺萨万集团叛国行动
    新华社河内26日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论指出，“美帝国主义不甘心它的失败，正在千方百计地帮助富米·诺萨万叛国集团破坏老挝人民所取得的成果，阴谋把老挝拖回附属美帝国主义的老路上去”。
    这篇题为“对美帝国主义及其老挝走狗的破坏活动要提高警惕”的评论指出，“据来自外国的消息说，美帝国主义拨出了十万多美元来帮助富米·诺萨万准备以武力反抗政变委员会和梭发那·富马政府。万象电台8月23日揭露泰国政府允许富米·诺萨万两营军队从沙湾拿吉取道泰国来到北汕县准备进攻万象。富米·诺萨万集团还企图从政治上强迫富马政府让步。”
    评论指出，老挝人民再一次面临着美帝国主义及其走狗的严重破坏。这种破坏行为和它们在1958年年中推翻由寮国战斗部队参加的、也是由梭发那·富马亲王担任首相的老挝联合政府的行为一模一样。过去的经验和美帝国主义目前的阴谋和行动，提醒老挝人民和老挝爱国进步力量不能不提高警惕，加强团结，以击败这种阴谋和行动。”
    评论说，在桑怒、丰沙里、川圹等地举行的有成千上万人参加的集会，要求政变委员会和富马政府必须对富米·诺萨万叛乱集团采取坚决的态度。富米·诺萨万军队中的许多士兵反抗了向万象进军的命令。评论指出，这一切都说明，老挝各阶层人民具有为实现真正的和平中立和民族和睦政策而斗争的坚强意志。
    评论说，“为了尽到维护关于老挝的日内瓦协议以及保卫印度支那和东南亚的和平的义务，越南人民严厉谴责和坚决反对美帝国主义干涉老挝内政的行为，并坚决支持老挝人民反美救国的斗争。”
    据新华社平壤26日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表评论，欢迎老挝新政府的和平中立政策，并强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗准备武装干涉老挝的阴谋。
    评论说，朝鲜人民相信，梭发那·富马政府表示奉行和平中立政策和履行日内瓦协议及万象协议的政策，无疑会使老挝局势得到安定，并为巩固印度支那和东南亚的和平作出贡献。
    评论说：目前美帝国主义侵略者正在更凶恶地露出獠牙，疯狂地向各国人民和世界和平进行挑战，美国统治集团露骨地敌视老挝的新政府及其政策，它的御用刊物公然煽动侵略性的东南亚条约组织集团武装干涉老挝。富米·诺萨万集团正在美帝国主义和东南亚条约组织的支持和唆使下准备武装进攻万象。但是，美帝国主义和它的走狗是在自掘坟墓。
    评论说，朝鲜人民同老挝人民一起决不容许破坏老挝和亚洲和平的美帝国主义及其走狗对老挝的侵略行为。美帝国主义的任何阴谋也阻挡不了老挝人民的前进。
