    High-Yielding, High-Quality Wild and Miscellaneous Fibers

    Cotton Stalk Bark
    Cotton stalk bark is produced in all cotton-growing regions of the country, estimated to be tens of millions of dan. Its fiber can be used to weave sacks and industrial packaging cloth.

    Apocynum
    Mainly produced in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Shandong and other regions. The national annual output is estimated to be several million dan. The fiber is fine, long, soft, and has strong tensile strength and high spinnability. It can be blended with silk to spin yarns of 60 counts or higher, and can also be blended with wool to weave high-grade clothing materials such as worsted.

    Flax
    Produced in Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Hebei, Ningxia and other regions, with an annual output of several million dan. The fiber is slightly inferior to Apocynum, but can also be used to weave canvas or clothing.

    Stinging Nettle
    Abundant in the northeastern provinces, with good fiber quality, similar to Apocynum.

    Wild Hemp
    Most abundant in Shaanxi, with quality similar to flax.

    Lophatherum Gracile
    Also called "Suo Cao" in Sichuan. It grows abundantly in more than a dozen provinces, (regions), and cities including Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, with an estimated annual output of several million dan, and quality similar to cotton stalk bark.

    Cattail
    Found in areas with lakes or abundant water sources in Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Jiangsu and other regions. It can be used to weave cattail bags, sacks, and industrial packaging cloth. (Attached picture)

    产量大质量高的野杂纤维
    棉秆皮
    全国产棉花的地区，都出产棉秆皮，估计可达数千万担，它的纤维可以织麻袋和工业包装用布。	罗布麻
    主要产在新疆、青海、甘肃、山东等地区，全国估计每年可产几百万担，纤维细、长、柔、而且拉力强，可纺性能很高，可以和绢丝混合纺出六十支以上的细纱来，还能与羊毛混纺织出凡尔丁等高级衣料。	胡麻
    产在内蒙古、甘肃、河北、宁夏等地区，年产量也有几百万担，纤维比罗布麻稍差些，但也可以织帆布或衣著用布。	螫麻
    东北各省都很多，纤维质量也很好，和罗布麻差不多。野麻
    陕西最多，质量和胡麻相仿。龙须草
    四川地区也叫蓑草，内蒙古、辽宁、四川、广东、广西等十几个省、（区）、市都大量生长，估计年产也达几百万担，质量和棉秆皮差不多。	蒲草
    内蒙古、陕西、辽宁、黑龙江、山东、江苏等有湖泊或水源较丰富的地区都有，可以编蒲草袋、织麻袋和工业包装用布。（附图片）
