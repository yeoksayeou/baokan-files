    Using Poetry to Inspire the People and Strike at the Enemy
    Huo Mansheng, Nantai People's Commune, Haicheng County, Liaoning Province
    I am an old peasant. Before liberation, my family didn't own a single room or a single plot of land. From a young age, I herded pigs and cattle for landlords. When I grew up, I became a manual laborer, doing that for twenty-nine years.
    During those twenty-nine years, my family often lacked food and clothing, and the landlords still forced us to pay taxes and levies. My father and mother often cried behind my back, and when I saw them, I felt very sad, but there was nothing else I could do. That wasn't all; especially the way the landlords oppressed the poor, it was truly suffocating. I liked storytelling and recounting old tales. One year, I worked for landlord Zhang's family in a neighboring village. One evening, after dinner, because I was chatting with my workmates under a tree, the landlord's son came up and started cursing. I argued back, and he pulled out a gun and pointed it at me. Others pulled him away, saving me from danger. But that anger remained in my heart. I thought to myself, why should a poor person be inferior to others...? My father hadn't gone to school for three generations, but my mother, out of spite, supported me to study for a few years. Plus, I liked to read storybooks, so I began to write doggerel to vent this anger. In the early years of the Republic of China, baojia teams were established. They fought, gambled, and harassed women, doing everything. At that time, I wrote a doggerel like this:
    The Republic was just built, and then baojia was established;
    Since the baojia was established, the peasants constantly sighed.
    Becoming a baojia soldier, a green aura rises from the grave,
    Housing, flower tax money, rent collection not according to land.
    If you ask who wrote it, your grandpa wrote it,
    Living in the Northeast, this Liaoning land,
    Don't report my name, you bastard, get angry.
    After writing it, I secretly posted it on the bell and drum tower of the big temple. After the baojia team discovered it, they were furious.
    After the Japanese imperialists occupied the Northeast, the police lackeys oppressed the people. One autumn afternoon, the puppet policeman Wang Shaowen came to our village and questioned an old, poor peasant named Wang Tingman, who was sixty-seven years old. Because he was old and deaf, he couldn't answer quickly enough, so he was kicked and punched on the spot, which made me tremble with anger. That night, I returned to the kitchen and couldn't sleep. After my companions were asleep, I secretly took out the bean oil lamp from the Buddha shrine of the master's grandmother, sat in the mill room, and wrote a clapper talk for half the night:
    Since the establishment of the stinking Manchuria,
    Every household is worried,
    The rich and powerful oppress,
    Not letting the poor lift their heads.
    Those old heads of the village,
    The agricultural promotion chairman and guildhall,
    These guys are even more unbearable,
    Specially antagonizing the poor.
    They are running dogs for the devils,
    Taking the masses as horses and oxen,
    Endless difficult days,
    When will it end?
    One day the spring thunder will sound,
    Overthrow the King of Hell and the devils,
    Our poor people will turn over,
    Repay grievances and avenge hatred.
    After writing it, I quietly posted it on the mountain gate of the big temple overnight. The next day, the fort was in an uproar, and the puppet village chief Huo Manlin cursed and interrogated everyone like a mad dog.
    In 1948, when it was time to plant crops, the Kuomintang reactionaries forced us to build gun emplacements. I also wrote a doggerel:
    Reactionaries, dog traitors,
    Just talking about them is annoying,
    Forcing donations and taxes is not enough,
    Plucking pigs and grabbing chickens without paying,
    Digging trenches to build gun emplacements,
    Building day after day,
    Scolding and cursing to urge people to work,
    Very afraid of the "Eighth Route Army" attacking the mountain.
    The reactionaries' crimes are great,
    Collapse is uncertain any day.
    If you ask who moved the pen,
    Li Bai wrote the poem, Du Fu glued it.
    Before liberation, for those decades of bitter days, we peasants were politically oppressed, economically exploited, and culturally restricted. We had no rights, no chance to go to school, and no right to watch a storybook or tell a clapper talk. At that time, I didn't understand that this was a struggle, I just felt that after writing and posting it on the wall, everyone would see it, and I would feel a little better.
    The Communist Party came and liberated our area. The anger pressing on my heart was released, the landlords were overthrown, and the bullies were defeated. During the land reform, I was elected as the vice-chairman of the peasant association and participated in the land reform struggle. From then on, I participated in production on the one hand and used my pen for propaganda work on the other. In 1951, when fighting the despotic landlord Huo Manlin, I wrote an accusation poem:
    Huo Manlin's crimes are heinous,
    Counter-revolutionary against the people,
    Blood debts are heavy, the people are angry,
    Today we send you to the gate of hell.
    Because my poems coordinated with the movement, I was encouraged by the district party secretary. Later, in every party movement, such as the propaganda of the Marriage Law, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, I wrote more than eighty clapper talks and nearly a hundred short poems.
    In 1958, the Party announced the general line for building socialism. The general line was like a bright light, illuminating the glorious future of our country and inspiring the people's enthusiasm. In a poem praising the general line, I wrote:
    The general line, the red flag waving,
    Shining brightly, ten thousand feet high,
    Six hundred million people are all laughing,
    Setting off a great upsurge in production.
    Industry and agriculture advance together,
    Satellites rush straight to the ninth heaven,
    One day equals twenty years,
    Ten thousand horses gallop to the golden bridge.
    The establishment of the people's commune made me feel younger than before, and my heart was brighter, and I had more energy. At that time, I wrote this poem:
    Buckwheat flowers bloom white,
    Good news spread across the country,
    Thousands of households set up communes,
    The flowers of communism bloom.
    In the Great Leap Forward, seeing the people's soaring enthusiasm and the heroic spirit of the whole people, I wrote:
    Picking manure to the south slope in the morning,
    Groups of women sing mountain songs,
    Mountain songs sing until sunset,
    Singing cotton stacks into piles.
    In 1959, to cooperate with the water conservancy construction and the increase production and practice economy movement, I wrote some works such as "Great Breakthrough in the Water and Manure Barrier", "Diligently and Frugally Manage the Household", and "Finding Horses on a Rainy Night".
    Since 1958, under the leadership of the Party and encouraged by the Great Leap Forward situation, my ideological consciousness has been further improved. Later, the brigade decided that I would look after the fish pond and take some time to do propaganda and mobilization work, so I participated in labor on the one hand and went deep into the masses to collect materials in my spare time on the other.
    When I joined the Party this year, I wrote another poem:
    I am a sunflower in the field,
    Dry branches and old leaves are near withered,
    Suddenly, I get the sunlight of Chairman Mao,
    Sweet rain is like wind, blowing day and night,
    The sunflower wants to bear fragrant sunflower seeds,
    Not failing the Party's good cultivation.
    Using the spirit of the general line to examine, the work I have done is far from enough. In the future, I must continue to study and strive to write more and better works to dedicate to the 40th anniversary of the Party.

    用诗歌鼓舞人民、打击敌人
    辽宁省海城县南台人民公社　霍满生
    我是一个老农民。解放前，家里房无一间，地无一垅，从小就给地主放猪、放牛，长大了就扛活，一连扛了二十九年。
    在这二十九年里，家里常常缺吃少穿，地主还要逼捐逼税。我父亲和我母亲常常背着我流泪，有时被我看见，我心中非常难过，可是又没有别的办法。这还不算，尤其是地主压在穷人头上，真叫人出不来气。我喜欢说书讲古，有一年，我给邻屯地主老张家扛活，一天晚饭后，因我在树下和伙计谈天，地主的儿子上前就破口大骂。我和他顶嘴，他就掏出手枪对着我，被旁人拉过去，才使我脱险。可是这口气一直压在我的心里。我心想，一个穷人，为什么要低人一等……。我父亲以前一连三辈没念过书，我母亲赌气供我念了几年书，再加上我还喜欢看唱本，我就琢磨编顺口溜，来出这口气。民国初年成立保甲队，他们打架斗殴、赌博、调戏妇女，什么都干。那时我编过这样一个顺口溜：
    民国刚建起，就把保甲立；
    自从立保甲，农民常叹气。
    当上保甲兵，坟上冒青气，
    住房花税钱，收租不按地。
    要问谁来写，大爷我写的，
    家住东三省，辽宁这块地，
    不报我的名，王八干生气。
    写完，我偷着贴在大庙钟鼓楼上，保甲队发现后，气得他们鼓鼓的。
    日本帝国主义侵占东北后，警察狗腿子压在人民头上。一个秋天的下午，伪警察王绍文到我们村来，向一个六十七岁的老贫农王庭满问话，由于他年迈耳聋，答话不及，就被拳打脚踢，当场把我气得浑身打颤。当晚，我回到伙房，翻来复去睡不着，等伙伴们都睡着了，我偷着端出东家奶奶佛龛上的豆油灯，坐在碾房，半宿写出一个快板：
    自从成立臭满洲，
    家家户户都忧愁，
    有钱有势来压迫，
    不让穷人抬起头。
    村中那些老会首，
    兴农会长和会楼，
    这些家伙更够受，
    专和穷人作对头。
    他给鬼子当走狗，
    净拿群众当马牛，
    无限艰难苦日子，
    何年何月熬到头。
    有朝一日春雷响，
    打倒阎王和鬼头，
    咱们穷人得翻身，
    冤报冤来仇报仇。
    写完了连夜悄悄地贴在大庙的山门上。第二天，堡子闹翻了天，伪屯长霍满林像疯狗似地挨门逐户谩骂追问。
    1948年正种地的时候，国民党反动派逼我们修炮垒，我也编了一个顺口溜：
    反动派，狗汉奸，
    说讲起来万人烦，
    逼捐要税还不算，
    捋猪抓鸡不给钱，
    挖战壕来修炮垒，
    修了一天又一天，
    连打带骂催人干，
    很怕“八路”来攻山。
    反动派的罪恶大，
    垮台不定哪一天。
    要问谁来动笔管，
    李白题诗杜甫粘。
    解放前，那几十年苦日子，咱农民在政治上受压迫，在经济上受剥削，在文化上也是受限制的、没有权利的，上学念书是没有份的，看个唱本说个快板也是没有份的。我那时候不明白这是斗争，就觉得编编，往墙上一贴，大伙一看，我心里舒畅点。
    共产党来了，解放了我们这地方，压在我心坎里的气吐出来了，斗倒了地主，打倒了恶霸。土改时我被选为农会副主任，参加了土改斗争。从此我一面参加生产，一面用我这支笔做宣传工作。1951年斗争恶霸地主霍满林时，我作了控诉诗：
    罪大恶极霍满林，
    反革命来反人民，
    血债累累有民愤，
    今日送你到鬼门。
    由于我的诗歌配合了运动，受到了区委书记的鼓励。以后，我在党的每次运动中，如宣传婚姻法、抗美援朝、互助合作等运动中，我共编写了八十多篇快板和近百首短诗。
    1958年党公布了建设社会主义的总路线，总路线像明灯一样，照亮了我国光辉的前景，鼓起了人民的干劲。我在歌颂总路线一首诗中这样写道：
    总路线，红旗飘，
    光芒闪耀万丈高，
    六亿人民齐欢笑，
    掀起生产大高潮。
    工农并举齐跃进，
    卫星直冲九重霄，
    一天等于二十年，
    万马奔腾上金桥。
    人民公社的成立使我变得比以前更年轻了，心里也更亮堂了，劲头更足了。那时，我写过这样一首诗：
    荞麦花开一片白，
    全国喜报传过来，
    千家万户办公社，
    共产主义鲜花开。
    大跃进中，看到了人民冲天的干劲，看到全民的豪迈气魄，我写过：
    早晨拣粪到南坡，
    成群妇女唱山歌，
    山歌唱到太阳落，
    唱的棉花垛成垛。
    1959年配合水利建设、增产节约运动，我编写了《大闯水粪关》、《勤俭持家》、《雨夜找马》等一些作品。
    1958年以来，在党的领导和大跃进形势的鼓舞下，我的思想觉悟，也进一步得到了提高。后来大队决定我看养鱼池，并抽出一些时间搞宣传鼓动工作，我就一方面参加劳动，一方面用业余时间深入群众，搜集材料。
    我今年入党时，又写了一首诗：
    我是田间向日葵，
    干枝老叶近枯萎，
    忽得主席阳光照，
    甘雨如风日夜吹，
    葵花要结香葵子，
    不负党的好栽培。
    用总路线的精神检查，我做的工作还差的很远，今后要不断地学习，争取写出更多、更好的作品，向党的四十周年献礼。
