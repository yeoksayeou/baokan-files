Socialist Countries Celebrate China's "August 1st" Army Day
Kim Chang-bong, General of the Korean People's Army, says that the Chinese and Korean armies are a powerful force for crushing US war provocations. A celebration rally was held in the Bulgarian capital to congratulate the achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in building the army. Romanian newspapers said that the Chinese People's Army has made great contributions under the wise leadership of the Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 1st: Kim Chang-bong, Chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, published an article in "Labor News" today, warmly congratulating the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The article described the glorious fighting path of the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The article said, "After the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has grown and become a powerful modernized armed force to defend the socialist achievements of the Chinese people, and a reliable fortress for peace and security in the Far East. The Korean People's Army is infinitely pleased and proud to have such a glorious revolutionary army with a long history of struggle and revolutionary tradition of more than 30 years—the Chinese People's Liberation Army—as its comrade-in-arms."

The article pointed out that the friendly relations between China and North Korea were formed and consolidated in the common struggle against imperialism.

The article then pointed out that the power of the friendly unity between the people of China and North Korea was brought into full play in the Korean People's Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggressors of US imperialism. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fought side by side, dealt a devastating blow to US imperialism, and drove them out of northern Korea.

The article said, "The fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers have established immortal great achievements in guaranteeing the historical victory of the Korean people's just liberation struggle for freedom and independence, and have made great contributions to the cause of restoring peace in Korea and defending peace in the East."

The article emphasized, "The immortal friendship and unity between the people and armies of China and North Korea, who have shared weal and woe in the long-term struggle against the common enemy, is a powerful force in the Far East to combat and crush the war provocation conspiracies of US imperialism."

The article then pointed out, "Today, US imperialism is intensifying the tense situation in various parts of the world, and is frantically carrying out new war provocation conspiracies, especially in the Far East." The article said, "All these facts further clearly prove that US imperialism is the chief culprit of international reactionary forces and the most ferocious enemy of peace and mankind."

The article said that today the revolutionary forces of the people of China and North Korea have grown and strengthened incomparably more than when the US imperialist aggressors launched the Korean War ten years ago. "The people and armies of China and North Korea, standing on the front lines of the peaceful and socialist East, are constantly vigilant and can defeat the armed aggression of any enemy."

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 1st: The Central House of the Bulgarian People's Army held a celebration meeting on July 29 to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. About 400 officers and soldiers of the Bulgarian People's Army attended the meeting.

The following attended the meeting: First Deputy Minister of National Defense of Bulgaria Bichvarov, Deputy Minister Kabachiev, Chief of General Staff of the People's Army Vrachiev, and Director of the Political Department of the People's Army Mishev.

Wang Peng, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Bulgaria, other members of the embassy, and military attachés from various countries in Sofia also attended the meeting.

Major General Tanzo Papazov of the Bulgarian People's Army made a report at the meeting. He pointed out that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has accumulated rich combat experience under the leadership of the Communist Party of China for 33 years, and has become an army with modern and excellent equipment. The Communist Party of China has widely used Marxism-Leninism and the rich experience of the Soviet army in building the army, and has combined this experience well with China's specific conditions in building the army.

He said: "All the achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are also our achievements. Our People's Army, its soldiers and officers, closely watch the achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, are happy for this achievement, and regard this achievement as its own."

He said: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army has become one of the most powerful armies in the world." "It resolutely defends peace in the Far East and the world, and is ready to give a fatal blow to the provocateurs of imperialist new wars together with the armies of other socialist countries."

Then, Wang Xiangsheng, military attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Bulgaria, also spoke at the meeting. He said: The most ferocious enemy of the people all over the world, US imperialism, is now in an unprecedented isolation. In recent years, in order to save its decline, US imperialism has tried its best to play the trick of false peace and true war preparation, and tried to carry out aggression and prepare for new wars under the cover of disguised peace. The nature of imperialist aggression and plunder will never change, and the people of all countries in the world must not have any unrealistic illusions about imperialism, especially US imperialism.

Wang Xiangsheng emphasized: "If the imperialists headed by the United States dare to provoke a war against the socialist camp, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will resolutely give the aggressors a fatal counterattack together with the Soviet army, the Bulgarian army and the armies of other socialist countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 31: The Romanian "Defense of the Motherland" newspaper published an editorial on July 31 to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The editorial said, "The Chinese People's Liberation Army has made special contributions in the Chinese people's struggle for freedom and national independence, and is an important factor in the victory of the Chinese people's revolution."

The article said that the People's Republic of China was announced on October 1, 1949. Since then, a new era has begun in the history of the Chinese people, that is, the era of building socialism and achieving fundamental victories in socialism. In the past few years, tremendous changes have taken place in all aspects of the economy and society of People's China. The creativity of the awakened people has brought about a surge in the national economy and culture, and has continuously improved the living standards of the working people. At present, China is carrying out a technical revolution and a cultural revolution by the whole people, which will further promote the surge of productivity.

The article said that the People's Republic of China is rapidly advancing in peaceful construction under the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism. Closely linked with the people of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the Chinese people are resolutely fighting for socialism, peace, and cooperation among all countries, and to stop the "Cold War" pursued by US imperialism and its allies. The People's Republic of China is a true fortress of peace in the Far East and a loyal defender of the security of the people of all countries in this region.

The article said, "The inexhaustible source of all the victories of the Chinese People's Army is the wise leadership of the Party and its unbreakable connection with the people. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has become a modern, mechanized force with strong firepower."

The article said, "Due to its revolutionary tradition and lofty goals, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is respected by all peace-loving and upright people in the world. The Romanian army has a deep friendly feeling for the army of People's China. The armies of Romania and China are closely united on the basis of common goals and aspirations—the complete victory of socialism, and the defense of the revolutionary achievements of the people of both countries and the entire socialist camp."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 1st: "People's Defense Daily" pointed out in an article celebrating the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on July 31 that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and closely linked with the people, has decisive merits in crushing the counter-revolutionary military forces and enabling the Chinese people to achieve final victory.

The article said that since 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, loyal to revolutionary traditions, has not only completed the main task of defending national defense, but has also become an important force in the socialist construction of the People's Republic of China. The army has made great contributions to expanding agricultural production and developing the national economy.

    据新华社平壤1日电　朝鲜人民军总参谋长金昌凤上将今天在“劳动新闻”上发表文章，热烈祝贺中国人民解放军建军三十三周年。
    文章叙述了中国人民解放军在中国共产党的领导下走过的光荣的斗争的道路。文章说，“在中国人民革命胜利和中华人民共和国成立以后，中国人民解放军发展壮大了，成为保卫中国人民的社会主义胜利果实的强大的现代化的武装力量，成为远东和平和安全的可靠的堡垒。朝鲜人民军为有这样的具有三十多年光辉的长期斗争历史和革命传统的光荣的革命军队——中国人民解放军作为自己的战友，感到无限的喜悦和自豪。”
    文章指出，朝中两国的友好关系是在反对帝国主义的历史的共同斗争过程中形成和巩固起来的。
    文章接着指出，朝中两国人民间的友好团结的威力在反对美帝国主义武装侵略者的朝鲜人民祖国解放战争中得到了发扬光大。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并肩地协同作战，给了美帝国主义歼灭性的打击，把它们从朝鲜北部赶了出去。
    文章说，“兄弟般的中国人民志愿军对于保证朝鲜人民争取自由和独立的正义的解放斗争的历史胜利，建立了不朽的伟大功勋。对恢复朝鲜的和平、保卫东方的和平事业作出了巨大的贡献。”
    文章强调说，“在反对共同敌人的斗争中长期同生死共患难的朝中两国人民和军队间的不朽的友谊和团结，是在远东打击和粉碎美帝国主义的战争挑衅阴谋的强大的力量。”
    文章接着指出，“美帝国主义今天在世界各地加剧紧张局势，特别是在远东地区疯狂地进行新战争的挑衅阴谋。”文章说，“这一切事实进一步清楚地证明，美帝国主义是国际反动势力的元凶，是和平和人类的最凶恶的敌人。”
    文章说，今天朝中两国人民的革命力量比十年前美帝国主义侵略者发动朝鲜战争时无比地成长和壮大了。“站在和平和社会主义东方前哨的朝中两国人民和军队经常保持着警惕，能够打败任何敌人的武装侵略。”
    据新华社索非亚1日电　保加利亚人民军中央之家在7月29日举行庆祝大会，纪念中国人民解放军建军三十三周年。到会的有保加利亚人民军官兵约四百人。

    出席大会的还有我国驻保加利亚大使馆临时代办王彭和使馆其他人员，以及各国驻索非亚的武官。
    保加利亚人民军少将坦佐·帕帕佐夫在会上作了报告。他指出，中国人民解放军三十三年来在中国共产党领导下，积累了丰富的战斗经验，已成为拥有现代化的优良装备的军队。中国共产党在建军方面，广泛地运用着马克思列宁主义和苏联军队建军方面的丰富的经验，并把这一经验很好地与中国的具体情况相结合。

    王祥生强调说：“如果以美国为首的帝国主义敢于向社会主义阵营各国挑起战争，中国人民解放军将同苏联军队、保加利亚军队和其他社会主义国家军队一起，坚决地给予侵略者以致命的回击。”
