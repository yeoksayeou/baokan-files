Cadres Going Down to the Fields Bring New Developments

    Kang Xiaomu Takes Root in Zhangyuan Ridge
    Zhangyuan Brigade, located forty *li* away from the commune Party committee's headquarters, was one of the most backward production brigades in the entire commune in the past. This time, the commune Party committee decided to have Kang Xiaomu, a member of the commune Party committee, concurrently serve as the secretary of the Party branch of this brigade.
    Kang Xiaomu was no stranger to the situation in Zhangyuan Brigade. He understood every cadre here, and they were all enthusiastic and proactive in their work. The main reason for the past backwardness in production was the lack of effective working methods among the cadres. Here, the team had an average of more than six *mu* of cultivated land per person. In the past, cadres were afraid of not keeping up with others in production, so they all lived together in the brigade headquarters, inspecting the roads every day and holding meetings every night to supervise and deploy, resulting in a busy and passive work style. In response to this situation, Kang Xiaomu proposed a thorough change in the style of leadership, suggesting that the brigade office, except for leaving the accountant and statistician to grasp progress and handle daily affairs, should all go deep into the production teams for fixed responsibility. He himself went to settle down in Wanggou production team, the most backward in the entire brigade.
    On the afternoon of the decision, in the hundred-mu high-yield corn plot in Wanggou Houwa under Zhangyuan Ridge, the commune members discovered a new strong laborer. He hoed the ground quickly and well, and this was Comrade Kang Xiaomu. While hoeing the ground, he chatted with the commune members and quickly became familiar with them. That afternoon, he learned about many problems. At dinner time, Comrade Kang Xiaomu and production team leader Wang Chenghai, among others, conducted research with the commune members at the dining area. After careful research, they quickly came up with solutions one by one. There was a shortage of tools and labor. After investigation, it was found that five weeding hoes had been lying idle in the warehouse, and they were now taken out. Various methods were also adopted to draw out ten strong laborers from the canteen, mill, and sideline production. As a result, the team's production quickly jumped up. The previous afternoon, thirty-three people were mobilized, working until dark, but only thirteen *mu* were hoed. After the problem was solved, thirty-nine and a half *mu* were hoed early the next morning, and thirty-seven *mu* were hoed in the morning. The fact that the progress of intertillage in Wanggou production team had increased several times gave the cadres of the entire brigade great inspiration.

    亢小木扎根张原岭
    距离公社党委所在地四十里的张原大队，是全社过去生产最落后的大队之一。这次，公社党委会决定让公社党委委员亢小木，去兼任这个大队的党支部书记。
    对张原大队的情况，亢小木并不陌生。他了解这里的每个干部，他们个个工作积极热情，过去生产落后的主要原因是干部的工作办法少。这里，全队每人平均有六亩多耕地。过去，干部害怕生产赶不上别人，便都集中住在大队部里，天天分路检查，夜夜开会督促布置，工作比较忙乱被动。针对这一情况，亢小木提出要彻底转变领导作风，建议大队办公室除留下会计、统计，掌握进度和处理日常事务以外，其余都深入到各生产队去，固定包干。他自己到全队最落后的王沟生产队去扎根落户。
    决议的当天下午，在张原岭下王沟后洼百亩玉米丰产方里，社员们就发现新添了一名强壮劳力。他锄地又快又好，这就是亢小木同志。他一边锄地一边和社员闲扯，很快就和社员混熟了。当天下午他便了解到许多问题。吃晚饭时，亢小木同志便和生产队长王成海等，在饭场上和社员们一一进行了研究。经过认真地研究，很快便都一一想出了办法。工具、劳力不足，经过查算，有五张耘锄原来堆放在仓库里睡觉，现在也搬出来了；又采取各种办法，从食堂、磨坊和副业生产方面，抽出了十个强壮劳力。于是全队的生产，便很快跃上去了。前一天下午，出动三十三个人，一直干到天黑洞洞才收工，却只锄了十三亩。问题解决后，第二天一清早，便锄了三十九亩半，上午又锄了三十七亩。王沟生产队中耕进度成几倍增长的事实，给了全大队干部很大的启示。
