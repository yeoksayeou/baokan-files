Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, August 14th: "Nepal News" published an editorial on August 11th, stating: "The strengthening of friendship between Nepal and China and the demarcation of the boundary line between these two countries are a historical necessity of long standing."

The newspaper continued by saying that, in order to realize this historical necessity, the meeting currently being held by the Joint Committee is of historically significant importance.

The newspaper also stated that although some malicious people are trying to undermine the friendship between Nepal and China, the Nepalese people are eager to strengthen their traditional friendly relations with China.

Kathmandu's "New Society Daily" published an editorial on August 12th, stating that, in fact, there is no unsolvable boundary issue between China and Nepal. It said, "Resolving the boundary issue between Nepal and China on a scientific basis will further strengthen the friendship between the two countries since ancient times. This is absolutely true."

Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, August 16th: Nepal's "Motherland Daily" published an editorial on August 12th regarding the Sino-Nepalese boundary issue talks, stating: "China and Nepal have always been good neighbors, and this good neighborly relationship has improved even more in recent years. Both countries believe in peaceful coexistence, and the main basis of their friendship is the principles of Panchsheel. Because of this, one side will not harbor territorial ambitions towards the other."

The editorial continued: "Straightforward, frank, and formal talks should be conducted, and neither side should have undue suspicion or concern about the other. We believe that the friendly resolution of the boundary issue between China and Nepal will provide a good example in history, namely: no matter how serious international issues are, as long as the countries concerned handle the issues with sincerity and honesty, they can always be resolved."

The editorial concluded by expressing the hope that the Sino-Nepalese Joint Boundary Committee "will successfully complete its task," and pointed out that "this will undoubtedly be a great achievement for the lasting friendship between the peoples of China and Nepal."
