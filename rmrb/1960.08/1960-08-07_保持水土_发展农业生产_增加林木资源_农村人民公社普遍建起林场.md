    Conserve Soil and Water, Develop Agricultural Production, Increase Forest Resources
    Rural People's Communes Universally Establish Forest Farms
    (Our report) In order to conserve soil and water, guarantee agricultural harvests, and increase forest resources, rural people's communes in Heilongjiang Province are vigorously developing commune-run forest farms. All of the province's six hundred-plus rural people's communes have now established forest farms. In addition, management districts have established more than four thousand forest farms and specialized teams; state-owned farms, ranches, and industrial and mining enterprises have established more than one hundred and fifty forest farms, forming a forest farm network throughout the province based on commune-run forest farms and supported by more than one hundred state-owned forest farms.
    The commune-run forest farms in Heilongjiang Province were established after the Provincial Party Committee's Forestry Work Conference in late February of this year. These commune-run forest farms have played a significant role in completing this year's spring afforestation tasks at high speed. In carrying out the large-scale mass afforestation movement, commune-run forest farms have adopted measures combining mass afforestation with regular professional management. Throughout the province, commune-run forest farms dispatched thirty-five thousand forestry technicians and cadres, who served as the backbone, widely organizing millions of commune members to cooperate with state-owned forest farm professional teams in conducting large-scale assault afforestation. The Songhua River region organized nearly one million commune members and forestry workers, who worked hard for seven days and overfulfilled the afforestation task. The commune-run forest farm in Tailai County dispatched five thousand commune members, who completed the afforestation task on ten thousand mu of barren mountains with guaranteed quality and quantity in just thirty-six hours. As a result, the province completed the spring afforestation task of more than 3,198,000 mu ten days ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan by 5%. Commune-run forest farms throughout the province planted different seedlings according to different characteristics. In the mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, commune-run forest farms created more than 1,390,000 mu of timber forest bases, and some also established fish farms, bee farms, and tree fungus farms in the forest farms, vigorously developing diversified operations. In the plains areas, commune-run forest farms, based on the spirit of changing the climate and beautifying the environment, created more than 536,000 mu of shelter forests and timber forests, and carried out intercropping between forests and agriculture, saving land, and developing animal husbandry in the forest farms. The people's communes in the suburban areas of the cities this year created 370,545 mu of economic forests, of which fruit tree forests accounted for 255,000 mu, and implemented intercropping of forests and vegetables to increase the supply of vegetables, fruits, and other non-staple foods to the cities.
    In Heilongjiang Province, thanks to the professional teams in the commune-run forest farms to carry out afforestation work, the speed and quality of tending young forests has greatly accelerated. At present, while firmly grasping weeding and loosening of soil in the farmland, the young forests have been universally weeded and loosened once, and the second weeding and loosening has begun. Therefore, the survival rate of this year's seedlings has generally increased from 85% last year to 95%. At the same time, because the commune-run forest farms have dedicated personnel to patrol the forest farm mother trees, they have mastered the seed source and seed maturity period. This summer's seed collection task was completed well, both in quantity and quality. To date, 840,000 jin of elm, poplar, and mulberry seeds have been collected, exceeding the plan by 71%, and increasing three times compared with the same period last year. In addition to supporting Jilin, Inner Mongolia, and other provinces and regions, these tree species are cultivated into small seedlings by the nurseries of commune-run forest farms, providing ample seedlings for next year's large-scale afforestation.

    保持水土　发展农业生产　增加林木资源
    农村人民公社普遍建起林场
    本报讯　黑龙江省农村人民公社，为了水土保持，保证农业丰收，和增加林木资源，大力发展社办林场。全省的六百多个农村人民公社已全部建起了林场，此外，管理区还办起了林场和专业队四千多个；国营农牧场、厂矿企业办起林场一百五十多个，使全省形成了以社办林场为基础、以一百多个国营林场为骨干的林场网。
    黑龙江省各地的社办林场，是在今年2月下旬省委林业工作会议以后建设起来的。这些社办林场，对高速度完成今年春季造林任务，发挥了很大的作用。社办林场在开展大规模群众造林运动中，采取了群众性造林和常年专业管理相结合的措施，全省社办林场出动了三万五千名林业技术工人和干部，以他们为骨干，广泛组织了数百万社员，配合国营林场专业队，进行了大兵团突击造林。松花江地区组织近百万社员和林业工人，奋战七天，超额完成了造林任务。泰来县社办林场出动五千名社员，仅用三十六小时，就保质保量地完成了万亩荒山的造林任务，因此，全省提前十天，超额5％完成了三百一十九万八千多亩的春季造林任务。全省各地的社办林场根据不同的特点，栽植了不同的苗木。在山区半山区的社办林场，营造了一百三十九万多亩用材林基地，有的还在林场里建立了养鱼场、养蜂场和木耳场，大力开展多种经营；平原地区的社办林场，本着改变气候、美化环境的精神，营造了五十三万六千多亩防护林和用材林，并开展了林农间作、节约用地和在林场里发展畜牧业。城郊区的人民公社，今年营造的经济林达三十七万零五百四十五亩，其中果树林就占二十五万五千亩，并实行了林菜间作，以增加城市蔬菜、水果等副食品供应。
    黑龙江省各地由于有了社办林场这个专业队伍，进行营林造林工作，大大的加快了幼林的抚育速度和质量。现在，全省在狠抓农田铲趟的同时，对幼林普遍铲趟完了一遍，开始第二遍铲趟，因此，今年的幼苗成活率，普遍由去年的85％提高到95％。同时，由于社办林场有专人巡视林场母树，掌握了种源和种子成熟期。今年夏季的采种任务，完成得又多又好，到目前为止，已采了榆树、杨树和桑树种八十四万斤，超过计划71％，比去年同期提高了三倍。这些树种除部分支援吉林、内蒙古等省区外，都由社办林场的苗圃育成小苗，给明年大规模的造林，准备了充分的苗木。
