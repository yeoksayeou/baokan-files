Xinhua News Agency, August 26th, San Jose Dispatch: Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa delivered a lengthy speech on August 25th at the meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization of American States, sternly accusing and condemning US aggression against Cuba, exposing the US attempt to use the meeting to instigate collective intervention in Cuba, and refuting the US's unwarranted attacks on Cuba. Roa reiterated that the Cuban people will fight to the end against US aggression and to defend their homeland.

Roa pointed out that the US's instigation of the Organization of American States to discuss the issue of intervention in Cuba is aimed at organizing an expeditionary force to invade Cuba; this action by the US is evidence of its preparation for armed aggression against Cuba. He said, "The tension and climate of aggression against Cuba created by the US is nothing more than preparation for military aggression."

Roa then recounted the US's various acts of aggression, from bombing Cuban sugarcane fields to cutting Cuba's sugar import quota, and condemned the US's military, political, and economic aggression against Latin American countries since the last century, an aggression that has culminated in the US's plot to launch a military invasion against Cuba.

Roa pointed out that the "accusations" made by the US against Cuba in its report submitted to the Pan American Peace Committee of the Organization of American States are shameless slanders, aimed at attempting to justify the US's military aggression against Cuba and to incite Latin American countries against Cuba. Roa said, "The Cuban Revolution is a nationalist, anti-feudal, and democratic revolution, whose mission is to create conditions for the genuine welfare and true freedom of the Cuban people." Roa also refuted the US's slanders that Cuba lacked so-called "individual freedom" and "freedom of the press." He said that Cuba cannot allow those responsible for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima to accuse Cuba of executing counter-revolutionary war criminals. He also said that the US government is merely "a tool of large corporations whose sole purpose is to make money"; and that "American freedom of the press is not only theoretical but also extremely hollow."

Roa sternly refuted the US's dissemination of the lie that the Americas are facing "interference from outside the continent" as a pretext for interfering in Cuba. He said, "Interference from outside the continent is imaginary, while the threat of US aggression is real." Speaking of the Soviet Union's support for the Cuban people, he said, "There is no question of Soviet interference; this is merely a spontaneous expression of willingness to provide assistance in the face of the threat of US aggression." Roa emphasized that Cuba "is not a satellite of anyone," but it "will not tolerate its enemies trying to prevent it from being friends with its friends." He also said that the Cuban government's policy is to trade with all countries in the world, regardless of their political nature. "Cuba will continue to maintain trade relations with all countries that buy Cuban products, whether the US likes it or not." Roa stated that Cuba is willing to resolve the problems between Cuba and the United States through negotiations, if the United States does not take unilateral steps against Cuba. Roa emphasized that the Cuban revolutionary government and the Cuban people are closely united and will fight to the death against any aggressors who dare to land in Cuba.

The Cuban delegation submitted a draft resolution to the meeting that day. The draft resolution condemned the United States as being responsible for exacerbating tensions in the Caribbean region and demanded that the meeting instruct the United States to abandon its policies of interference, provocation, and aggression against Cuba. The draft resolution also requested the meeting to declare that land reform is a fundamental development in Latin America; Latin American countries have the right to carry out such internal reforms, and the United States should respect this right.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th, San Jose Dispatch: At the recent meetings of foreign ministers of the Organization of American States, many representatives of Latin American countries expressed unwillingness to follow the US's stance of intervening in Cuba or raised reservations. At the meeting on the 24th, US Secretary of State Herter delivered a lengthy speech. Herter rehashed the old tunes that Cuba "is moving towards a communist country" and falsely accused Cuba of lacking "basic human rights and freedoms" and not practicing "representative democracy," and slandered the Soviet Union and China's support for the Cuban people's just stand against US aggression as "interfering in Pan-American affairs," attempting to coerce Latin American countries to participate in the US's dirty schemes to further intervene in Cuba under the guise of so-called "opposing foreign interference" and "safeguarding the democratic principles of the Americas."

The next day, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Arcaya said at the meeting that Venezuela firmly opposes the meeting "taking any measures under the pretext of fighting communism that could be interpreted as restricting democratic freedoms." He also criticized Herter's slanderous remarks about the Soviet Union's "infiltration" and "Cuba being a center of communist conspiracy." He said, "Anyone who does not believe that Cuba has made progress in the revolutionary process and has every right to define the direction of the revolution according to the needs of its people is tantamount to offending Cuba's pride in its sovereignty and helping to create a bleak future for the Americas with violence and a fevered mind."

Arcaya suggested that the meeting: "1. Unrestrictedly approve the principle of the right of self-determination of all peoples, thereby confirming Cuba's unquestionable right to freely develop cultural, political, and economic spontaneous changes, which should be vigorously guaranteed by our countries; 2. Vigorously approve the condemnation of any interference from outside and inside the continent."

At the meeting on the 24th, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Martínez Montero said, "It should be concluded that the Cuban people exercised their undeniable right to overthrow the dictatorship in a revolutionary manner and establish a government that conforms to their political intentions." He emphasized that "there should be no blame" for this.

Panamanian Foreign Minister Moreno said at the same meeting that Cuba should be enabled to decide its own destiny. He also accused the United States of adopting discriminatory measures in the Panama Canal Zone and demanded that the Panamanian flag be hung in the Panama Canal Zone and "obtain all the benefits from the canal on territory that falls entirely within Panamanian sovereignty."

The Mexican delegation has submitted a draft resolution to the meeting, requesting "Cuba to reaffirm its trust in the Pan-American system"; however, it also emphasized that "the American republics will continue to support the Cuban revolution in its struggle to improve the economy and achieve social justice." According to United Press International, Mexico's draft resolution has quickly gained the support of many countries' representatives, including Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Honduras, and Peru.

On the other hand, many Latin American countries have shown relatively great interest in increasing US "aid." According to Agence France-Presse, as of the 25th, five of the six draft resolutions submitted by Latin American delegations to the meeting secretariat were on the issue of Pan-American economic relations, including Brazil's request to add an "Economic Assistance Supplementary Protocol" to the Rio de Janeiro Convention and other countries' resolutions supporting Brazil's request for the United States to provide economic "aid" through a "Pan-American Action Plan."

    古巴外长在美洲国家外长会议上严正表示
    古巴人民决心为反对美国侵略战斗到底
    许多拉丁美洲国家外长表示不愿追随美国的干涉政策
    据新华社26日讯　圣约瑟消息：古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚25日在美洲国家组织成员国外长会议上作了长篇发言，严正控诉和谴责美国对古巴的侵略，并且揭露美国企图利用这次会议策动集体干涉古巴的阴谋，并驳斥了美国对古巴的无端攻击。罗亚重申，古巴人民将为反对美国侵略和保卫祖国而战斗到底。
    罗亚指出，美国策动美洲国家组织来讨论干涉古巴的问题，是为了组织一支侵略古巴的远征部队；美国的这种做法就是它准备对古巴进行武装侵略的证据。他说，“美国所制造的紧张和反对古巴的侵略的气候不是别的，正是进行军事侵略的准备。”
    罗亚接着控诉美国从轰炸古巴甘蔗园到削减古巴进口食糖份额的种种侵略行动，并且谴责美国从上世纪起就对拉丁美洲国家进行军事、政治和经济侵略，这种侵略以美国策划对古巴发动军事侵略的阴谋而达到顶点。
    罗亚指出，美国在它提交给美洲国家组织泛美和平委员会的报告中对古巴提出的“控告”是无耻的诽谤，其目的是企图把美国对古巴的军事侵略说成是正当的，并借此煽动拉丁美洲国家来反对古巴。罗亚说，“古巴革命是民族主义的、反封建的和民主的革命，其任务是为古巴人民的真正福利和真正自由创造条件。”罗亚还驳斥了美国诬蔑古巴没有所谓“个人自由”、“新闻自由”的说法。他说，古巴不能容许那些应对用原子弹轰炸广岛负责的人来指责古巴处决反革命战犯。他还说，美国政府不过是“其全部目的在于赚钱的大公司的工具”；而“美国的新闻自由不但只是理论上的，而且是极其空洞的”。
    罗亚严词驳斥了美国为干涉古巴制造借口而散布的所谓美洲面临“大陆以外的干涉”的谰言。他说，“来自大陆以外的干涉是假想的，而美国的侵略威胁却是实在的。”他在谈到苏联对古巴人民的支持时说，“根本不存在什么苏联进行干涉的问题，这只是在面临美国侵略意图的威胁下自动表示愿意提供帮助”。罗亚强调说，古巴“不是任何人的卫星国”，但是它“不会容忍它的敌人设法阻止它同它的朋友做朋友”。他还说，古巴政府的政策是同世界各国——不管其政权性质如何——进行贸易。“古巴将继续同购买古巴产品的所有国家保持贸易关系，不管美国乐意不乐意”。罗亚表示，如果美国不对古巴采取单方面的步骤，古巴愿意通过谈判来解决古巴同美国之间存在的问题。罗亚强调说，古巴革命政府和古巴人民紧密地团结在一起，将同胆敢在古巴登陆的侵略者进行殊死的战斗。
    古巴代表团在当天向会议提出了决议草案。决议草案谴责美国应该对加剧加勒比海地区的紧张局势负责，并且要求会议责成美国放弃对古巴进行干涉、挑衅和侵略的政策。决议草案还要求会议宣布，土地改革是拉丁美洲的一种基本发展；拉丁美洲国家有权进行这种内部改革，美国应该尊重这种权利。
    新华社26日讯　圣约瑟消息：在美洲国家组织成员国外长会议最近几天的会议上，许多拉丁美洲国家的代表表示不愿意追随美国干涉古巴的立场，或者提出了保留的意见。在24日的会议上，美国国务卿赫脱曾经作了冗长的发言。赫脱重新弹唱古巴“正在朝着共产党国家前进”和诬蔑古巴没有“基本人权和自由”、不实行“代议制民主”等滥调，并且诬蔑苏联和中国支持古巴人民反对美国侵略的正义立场是“干涉泛美事务”，企图在所谓“反对外来干涉”和“维护美洲民主原则”的幌子下，胁迫拉丁美洲国家参与美国进一步干涉古巴的肮脏勾当。
    第二天，委内瑞拉外交部长阿卡亚在会议上说，委内瑞拉坚决反对会议“在同共产主义斗争的借口下采取任何会被解释为限制民主的自由的措施”。他还指责了赫脱诬蔑苏联“渗透”和“古巴已经是共产主义阴谋中心”的说法。他说，“谁要是不相信古巴已在革命过程中取得进步并且完全有权按照本国人民的需要规定革命的方向，谁就无异冒犯了古巴对主权的自豪感，就无异于以暴力和热昏的头脑帮助造成美洲暗淡的前景。”
    阿卡亚建议会议：“一、无限制地批准各国人民自决权的原则，从而确认古巴有无可置疑的权利去自由发展文化、政治和经济的自发变革，由我们各国加以有力的保证；二、有力地批准对任何大陆以外和大陆内部干涉的谴责。”
    在24日的会议上，乌拉圭外交部长马丁内斯·蒙特罗说，“应该得出结论：古巴人民运用了他们无可否认的权利，革命地推翻了独裁政府，建立了一个符合他们政治意向的政府。”他强调指出，对于这点“不应该有什么责难”。
    巴拿马外交部长莫雷诺在同一天的会议上说，应该使古巴能够决定它自己的命运。他还指责美国在巴拿马运河区采取歧视措施，并且要求在巴拿马运河区悬挂巴拿马国旗，和“得到从处于全部属于巴拿马主权范围内的领土上的运河所得到的一切好处。”
    墨西哥代表团已经向会议提出一项决议草案，要求“古巴重申对泛美体系的信任”；但是，它同时强调表示“美洲各共和国将继续支持古巴革命为改善经济和实现社会正义而斗争”。据合众国际社报道，墨西哥的这项决议草案已经迅速获得包括委内瑞拉、玻利维亚、厄瓜多尔、洪都拉斯、秘鲁等国在内的许多国家代表的支持。
    另一方面，许多拉丁美洲国家对增加美“援”表现了比较大的兴趣。据法新社报道，截至25日为止，拉丁美洲国家代表团向会议秘书处提出的六项决议草案中，有五项是关于泛美经济关系问题的，其中包括巴西提出的要求在里约热内卢公约中附加一项“经济援助补充议定书”以及其它国家支持巴西要求美国给予经济“援助”的“泛美行动计划”的决议草案。
