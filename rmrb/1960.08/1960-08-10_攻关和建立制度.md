Title: Attacking Key Problems and Establishing Systems

　　After reading the news about the Julu Iron and Steel Plant, I have two thoughts.

　　First, technical innovation and technical revolution must extensively mobilize the masses. This is the foundation of the movement. However, as leaders of enterprises, we must also be good at grasping the key points, identifying different critical issues in production at different times, and guiding workers to solve these key problems. Only in this way can we promote the movement to deepen step by step. In the words of the Julu Iron and Steel Plant, it is to "organize attack-the-fortress battles." Concentrate forces to attack one key problem at a time, and not give up until it is solved. After conquering one fortress, consolidate it, and then conquer another. What does "conquering" mean? What does "consolidating" mean? Conquering means truly and effectively solving the problem, increasing production, and achieving the expected results. Consolidating means that everyone has truly mastered the new technologies and new experiences created and that they have been transferred to normal production. Attacking key problems one by one in this steady and solid manner may seem slower on the surface, but it will actually not be slow and will truly achieve speed. The facts of the Julu Iron and Steel Plant are proof of this.

　　Second, if we want to consolidate the achievements of innovation, establishing and implementing corresponding rules and regulations is an indispensable measure. All reasonable rules and regulations reflect the laws of objective development. Once reasonable rules and regulations are established, they will help us understand and master the laws of objective development and help us overcome blindness in practical activities. Reasonable rules and regulations are a weapon to promote the development of objective things. Therefore, modifying and formulating corresponding rules and regulations based on the achievements of technical innovation and technical revolution is by no means dispensable, but a necessary measure to consolidate the achievements of innovation, expand the results of the battle, that is, to transform the technology originally mastered by a few people into the technology mastered by the majority. Resolutely implementing rules and regulations is by no means to restrict people's initiative, but to enable people to grasp greater initiative and exert greater initiative in the struggle to transform objective things (in enterprises, in the struggle for production).

### 攻关和建立制度

    攻关和建立制度
    读了巨鹿炼铁厂的新闻，有两点感想。
    第一，技术革新、技术革命，一定要广泛发动群众，这是运动的基础，但是，作为企业的领导者，还要善于抓重点，在不同的时期，找出生产上不同的关键，引导职工去解决关键问题。这样，才好推动运动步步深入。用巨鹿炼铁厂的话来说，就是“组织攻关战役”。一次集中力量攻一个关，攻不下来不罢休。攻克了一个关巩固一个关，然后再攻克另一个关。何谓“攻克”？何谓“巩固”？攻克，就是的的确确解决了问题，生产上去了，并且达到了预期的效果。巩固，就是大家对创造的新技术、新经验，确实掌握了，转入正常生产了。这样稳扎稳打地一个一个攻关键，表面看来似乎慢些，实际上不会慢，反而真能做到快。巨鹿炼铁厂的事实就是证明。
    第二，要想把革新成果巩固下来，建立和贯彻执行相应的规章制度，是一条不可缺少的措施。一切合理的规章制度，都是客观事物发展规律的反映。合理的规章制度一旦建立起来以后，它就会帮助我们认识和掌握客观事物的发展规律，帮助我们在实践活动中克服盲目性。合理的规章制度是促进客观事物发展的一个武器。所以，根据技术革新、技术革命成果修改和制订相应的规章制度，决不是可有可无的事情，而是巩固革新成果，扩大战果，即把原来是少数人掌握的技术变为大多数人掌握的技术的必要措施。坚决执行规章制度，决不是为了限制人们的主动性，而是为了人们在改造客观事物的斗争中（在企业来说，就是在生产斗争中）掌握更大的主动权，发挥更大的主动性。
