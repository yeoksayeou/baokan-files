Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 7th: While producing agricultural machinery to support agriculture, workers in Tianjin's mechanical and electrical industries are actively rushing to manufacture a large number of steel and coal production equipment and accessories to support steel and coal production. As of July 30, the city's mechanical and electrical industries had produced a total of 4,619 units (pieces) of equipment such as blowers, motors, and mine cars in just four months, timely adapting to the needs of key enterprises such as Baotou Steel, Shijiazhuang Steel, and Fengfeng Coal Mine for continued leap forward in production.

In the process of manufacturing steel and coal production equipment, workers in Tianjin's mechanical and electrical industries have always adhered to starting from the overall situation, organizing a large-scale collaboration network based on factories producing key projects and with general manufacturing factories cooperating. In the collaboration, they did not distinguish between factories or industries, forming a communist large-scale collaboration upsurge where if one factory had difficulties, all factories would come to support. When Tianjin Xin'an Electric Motor Factory was producing a 360-kilowatt large high-voltage motor and had insufficient electricians, the Electrical Machinery Bureau immediately transferred more than 30 electricians from the same industry to provide support. When Tianjin Insulating Material Factory heard that Xin'an Electric Motor Factory needed a large amount of high-grade insulating glass mica cloth for the high-voltage motor used for Baotou Steel, it took the initiative to concentrate the factory's old workers who could produce glass mica cloth to rush to manufacture it, supplying Xin'an Electric Motor Factory with 1,200 kilograms in a very short period of time, meeting the factory's needs.

Workers in Tianjin's mechanical and electrical industries also rushed to manufacture a large number of equipment and accessories to support the technical transformation of the city's four steel mills. The Machinery Bureau alone rushed to manufacture more than 1,400 units (pieces) of technical transformation equipment and accessories for Tianjin Steel Plant, with a total equipment weight of more than 4,680 tons. Tianjin Boiler Factory, First Riveting Factory, Papermaking Machinery Installation Company, and Hebei Metallurgical Machinery Repair Factory and other units, in the process of supporting the technical transformation of Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant, launched a labor competition, striving to excellently complete the equipment manufacturing tasks undertaken by their respective factories.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 7th: Henan Province's machinery industry is seizing the time to manufacture supporting products for metallurgical equipment to support the leap forward in steel production.

As of the end of July, the province's machinery industry had completed 1,577 units (pieces) of metallurgical equipment supporting products distributed by the state, such as air compressors, drum controllers, blowers, winches, steel ladles, transformers, and crushers, more than doubling the same period last year. In the first half of this year, the machinery industry in Xinyang Prefecture manufactured the equipment needed for a 55-cubic-meter blast furnace, twelve sets of standard equipment for 28-cubic-meter blast furnaces, as well as a large number of hot air pipes and scattered parts needed for the transformation of small blast furnaces, totaling more than 2,000 tons, enabling the transformed small blast furnaces and newly built small blast furnaces to be put into production in a timely manner. The machinery industry in this prefecture also tightly grasped the manufacturing tasks of supporting equipment in several aspects directly related to steel production, such as coal, coke, ore, transportation, and electricity, completing more than 390 tons in the first half of the year.

Many machinery factories in Henan Province also relied on their own efforts to produce some raw materials in the process of rushing to manufacture supporting products for metallurgical equipment. For example, the Kaifeng No. 2 Machinery Factory established a coking workshop to ensure the production needs of the factory. The workers of Xinyang No. 1 Machinery Factory manufactured sixty tons of metallurgical equipment supporting products, only asking the higher authorities for thirty tons of raw materials, with the rest of the raw materials being pig iron smelted by the factory itself.

    让台台设备配套齐全
    天津机电行业协作造机器制配件  河南机械工厂抓紧生产配套产品
    新华社天津7日电　天津市机电工业职工在生产农业机械支援农业的同时，积极赶制大批钢铁和煤炭生产设备和配件，支援钢铁和煤炭生产。到7月30日止，全市机电工业在短短的四个月之内生产出鼓风机、电动机和矿车等设备共四千六百一十九台
  （件），及时适应了包钢、石钢、峰峰煤矿等重点企业生产继续跃进的需要。
    天津市机电行业职工在制造钢铁、煤炭生产设备的过程中，始终坚持从全局出发，按任务，按工种，组成了以生产重点项目的工厂为主、一般承制厂协作配合的大协作网。他们在协作中不分工厂，不分行业，形成了一厂有困难，各厂都来支援的共产主义大协作的热潮。天津新安电机厂在生产三百六十瓩的大型高压电动机时，电工不足，电机局便立即从同行业中抽调出三十多名电工支援。天津绝缘器材厂听到新安电机厂生产保钢用的高压电动机需要大量高级绝缘玻璃云母布，就主动集中本厂能生产玻璃云母布的老工人突击赶制，在很短的时间内供应了新安电机厂一千二百公斤，满足了这个厂的需要。
    天津市机电行业职工还赶制了大批设备和配件，支援本市四个钢厂技术改造。只是机械局为天津钢厂赶制的技术改造设备和配件就有一千四百多台（件），设备总重量达四千六百八十多吨。天津锅炉厂、第一铆造厂、造纸机械安装公司和河北省冶金机械修配厂等单位，在支援天津市第二钢厂技术改造的过程中，开展了劳动竞赛，争相出色地完成了本厂所担负的设备制造任务。
    据新华社郑州7日电　河南省机械工业抓紧制造冶金设备配套产品。支持钢铁生产跃进。
    截至7月底，全省机械工业已完成国家分配的空气压缩机、鼓型控制器、鼓风机、卷扬机、钢水包、变压器、破碎机等冶金设备配套产品一千五百七十七台（件），比去年同期增长了两倍多。信阳专区的机械工业今年上半年就制造了一座55立方米高炉所需的设备，和十二套28立方米高炉的标准设备，还有大批改造小高炉需要的热风管及零星的机件，总共达两千多吨，使改造的小高炉和新建的小高炉及时投入了生产。这个专区的机械工业，对于与钢铁生产有直接关系的煤、焦、矿、运、电等几个方面的配套设备制造任务，抓的也很紧，上半年共完成三百九十多吨。
    河南省许多机械工厂，在赶制冶金设备配套产品的过程中，还自力更生地生产部分原料材料。如开封市第二机械厂建立炼焦车间，保证了本厂生产需要。信阳第一机械厂的职工，制造了六十吨的冶金设备配套产品，只向上级要了三十吨原料，其余的原料就是本厂炼的生铁。（附图片）
