Xinhua News Agency, August 13th, Elisabethville Dispatch: A group of youths in Katanga Province of Congo held a demonstration in the provincial capital, Elisabethville, opposing Tshombe's treacherous actions of splitting Congolese territory and undermining Congolese independence and unity, and protesting the Katanga provincial authorities' atrocities in suppressing patriots. It is reported that the demonstration was organized by the Balubakat Party, an opposition party in the province.

The demonstrators, while marching towards the city center, were suppressed by police officers commanded by Belgian officers, and about thirty demonstrators were arrested. However, sources say that the Balubakat Party will organize new demonstrations together with its allies.

According to reports from Leopoldville, the Congolese government convened the governors of Leopoldville Province, Kasai Province, Kivu Province, Orientale Province, and Équateur Province in Leopoldville to discuss the Katanga Province issue. Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba announced in a statement today that the attendees unanimously agreed that if the Katanga Province issue cannot be properly resolved, Congolese troops must enter Katanga. Lumumba said that the attendees also demanded that the Congolese government take strong measures to stop the sabotage, subversion, and activities threatening Congolese national security orchestrated by imperialists, and authorized the Minister of Information to supervise foreign publications.

In the statement, Lumumba also revealed that some Belgian colonial military personnel were operating in Congo in plain clothes with United Nations emblems. According to the Associated Press, Lumumba has notified the United Nations Under-Secretary-General, American national Bunch, that these people must leave Congo immediately, or the Congolese police will arrest them.

    据来自利奥波德维尔的消息说，刚果政府曾召集利奥波德维尔省、开赛省、基伍省、东方省和赤道省五省省长在利奥波德维尔开会讨论加丹加省的问题。刚果总理卢蒙巴在今天的声明中宣布：与会者一致同意，如果加丹加省的问题不能适当解决，刚果军队必须开进加丹加。卢蒙巴说，与会者还要求刚果政府采取有力措施，以制止帝国主义者策划的破坏、颠复和威胁刚果国家安全的活动，并且授权新闻部长对外国出版物进行监督。
    卢蒙巴在声明中还揭露，一些比利时殖民军人员穿着挂有联合国徽章的便服，在刚果进行活动。据美联社报道，卢蒙巴已经通知联合国副秘书长、美国人本奇，这些人必须立即离开刚果，否则刚果警察就要逮捕他们。
