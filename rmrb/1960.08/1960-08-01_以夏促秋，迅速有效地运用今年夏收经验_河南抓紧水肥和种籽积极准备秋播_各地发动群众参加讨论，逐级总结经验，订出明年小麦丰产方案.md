　　This newspaper's Zhengzhou dispatch on July 31st: Henan Province is carrying out a mass movement from bottom to top to summarize the experience of this summer's wheat harvest, using summer to promote autumn, and this year to promote next year. Currently, various regions are fully utilizing this year's experience to formulate next year's wheat abundance plans, and while managing autumn fields, they are seizing the three key elements of water, fertilizer, and seeds to actively prepare for autumn planting.

　　This year, the vast majority of areas in Henan Province achieved a bumper wheat harvest. This is a brilliant achievement won by overcoming the threat of nearly a year of drought, so this year's wheat production experience is extremely rich, especially the experience of vigorously grasping high-yield plots and implementing the policy of planting more to harvest more (this year, the area of ​​high-yield wheat plots in the province accounted for more than 30% of the total area, and the wheat area in the province also expanded by several million mu compared to last year).

　　In order to summarize experience in a timely manner, a mass summary movement was widely launched in various regions from the beginning of the wheat harvest; the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and other relevant units also formed six wheat abundance experience summary groups to go to various places to help with the summary. Each prefecture and county formed wheat abundance investigation teams, went deep into communes, teams, high-yield plots, and experimental fields, and adopted the method of combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and the masses, with everyone participating in discussions, everyone providing information, and making summaries level by level from bottom to top. Chen Dongsheng, Secretary of the Xinxiang Prefectural Party Committee Secretariat, led cadres and technicians to the front line to summarize the wheat abundance experience with the masses and then promoted it on the spot.

　　The Xinxiang Prefecture was one of the regions in the province with the longest period of drought this year. It had not rained thoroughly for more than 300 days in the entire prefecture. However, due to upholding the principle of putting politics in command, strengthening the leadership of the Party, and giving full play to people's subjective initiative, they opened canals, dug rivers, and drilled machine wells, persisted in the fight against drought, and finally overcame the drought. All 12,910,000 mu of wheat in the prefecture were irrigated three to four times, and large-scale water conservancy construction was carried out in the fight against drought, so that more than 2 million mu of mountainous hills also realized high-mountain water conservancy, winning a bumper harvest. This year, the prefecture also established more than 3,310,000 mu of high-yield plots in plains, hills, saline-alkali, and low-lying areas. These high-yield plots were carefully managed and yielded more than ordinary fields. This year, 2,170,000 mu of wasteland was reclaimed to expand wheat fields, so that the prefecture's wheat not only had a significant increase in yield per mu, but also a significant increase in total output. After summarizing this year's wheat production experience, the Xinxiang Prefecture, with a spirit of continuous revolution, formulated a plan to strive for a greater wheat harvest in 1961, preparing to expand the area of ​​high-yield wheat plots by another 40% in the autumn, and reclaim another 1 million mu of wasteland to expand the area.

　　In order to fully utilize the experience of drought resistance and harvest preservation this summer and strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year, all parts of the province are currently grasping the three key elements of water, fertilizer, and seeds and actively preparing for wheat sowing.

　　According to the spirit of taking water as the key link and carrying out water conservancy construction throughout the year, in order to resist drought for a long time and overcome drought, the province launched a movement to double the number of earth wells and machine wells, vigorously develop underground water, vigorously develop machine well groups, expand the irrigation area, and implement double insurance for wells and canals. They are also seizing the current rainy season to repair water conservancy projects, vigorously divert and store water, and ensure that ponds are full and reservoirs are level, to prepare for watering the bottom layer of soil for autumn sowing.

　　Under the slogan of "Vigorously grasping fertilizer, preparing sufficient top dressing and base fertilizer for autumn fields and wheat fields," more than 3.4 million people in the province are mobilized every day to accumulate and produce fertilizer. Since July, more than 169 billion jin of various fertilizers have been accumulated in more than 20 days. In addition to applying top dressing to autumn fields, areas with good fertilizer accumulation conditions have already begun to compress and rot base fertilizer for autumn sowing. Nanyang Prefecture proposed to accumulate 80 billion jin of farm manure and 800 million jin of local chemical fertilizer in the three months of July, August, and September to ensure that high-yield plots of autumn crops are applied with 5,000 to 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and general fields are applied with 3,000 to 5,000 jin. Meng County vigorously carried out the "10,000 mu and 1,000 pond" slurry fertilizer rotting movement. More than 70,000 of the county's more than 80,000 thatched ponds are full of slurry. In addition to the more than 700 million jin that have been accumulated for top dressing of autumn fields, they are now starting to accumulate and rot base fertilizer for autumn sowing.

　　In order to replace and expand the area of ​​improved varieties in a planned way, the province is currently conducting seed census stations and teams and improved variety allocation work on the basis of reserving sufficient selected seeds. The province plans to allocate 50 million jin of excellent varieties such as Nanda "2419", Pingyuan "51", Baiyupi, and Neixiang No. 5. These varieties have the characteristics of high yield, rust resistance, lodging resistance, water resistance, fertilizer resistance, thick stems, and multiple flowers. After the census, communes and teams that have selected and reserved enough improved varieties mainly do a good job in special warehouse management, turn and dry them in time, and must not use them; for those that have reserved enough, but the quality is not good and the variety is single, the exchange between communes and teams will be organized; the state will try to help those that have not selected enough to ensure that improved varieties are sown.

    以夏促秋，迅速有效地运用今年夏收经验
    河南抓紧水肥和种籽积极准备秋播
    各地发动群众参加讨论，逐级总结经验，订出明年小麦丰产方案
    本报郑州31日电　河南省自下而上地开展群众性的总结夏季小麦丰收经验，以夏促秋，以今年促明年。目前，各地充分运用今年的经验，制定明年小麦丰产方案，并且在管好秋田的同时，抓住水、肥、种三大关键，积极进行秋播准备工作。
    今年河南省绝大部分地区获得了小麦丰收。这是战胜将近一年的旱灾威胁而取得的辉煌成就，因而今年小麦生产的经验极为丰富，特别是大抓丰产方、贯彻多种多收方针的经验（今年全省小麦丰产方面积占总面积的30％以上，全省小麦面积也比去年扩大几百万亩）。
    为了及时总结经验，从麦收开始，各地就广泛开展了群众性的总结运动；省农业厅、农业科学分院等有关单位也组成六个小麦丰产经验总结组，分赴各地帮助总结。各专、县都组成小麦丰产调查小组，深入到社、队、丰产方、试验田，采取领导干部、技术人员和群众相结合的办法，人人参加讨论，个个提供资料，自下而上逐级作出了总结。新乡地委书记处书记陈东升带领干部和技术员深入现场同群众一起总结了小麦丰产经验之后，就地作了推广。
    新乡专区是今年全省干旱时间最长的一个地区。全区三百多天未下过透雨，但是由于坚持了政治挂帅，加强了党的领导，充分发挥了人的主观能动性，开渠、挖河、打机井，坚持抗旱斗争，终于战胜干旱，全区一千二百九十一万亩小麦普浇了三水到四水，而且在抗旱中大搞水利建设，使二百多万亩的山地丘岭，也实现了高山水利化，夺取了丰收。全区今年还在平地、丘陵、盐碱、低洼地区建立了三百三十一万多亩的丰产方，这些丰产方由于精心管理，都比一般田增产。今年还开荒扩大麦田二百一十七万亩，使全区小麦不仅单产有很大提高，总产也有很大增长。新乡专区在总结了今年小麦生产经验以后，以不断革命精神制订了争取1961年小麦更大丰收的规划，准备秋季把小麦丰产方面积再扩大40％，并且再开荒扩大面积一百万亩。
    为了充分运用今年夏季抗旱保丰收的经验，争取明年小麦大丰收，当前全省各地抓紧水、肥、种三大关键，积极进行小麦播种准备工作。
    根据以水为纲，水利建设贯彻全年的精神，为了长期抗旱，战胜干旱，全省开展了土井、机井翻番运动，大搞地下水，大搞机井群，扩大灌溉面积，实行井渠双保险。并且抓紧当前雨季，整修水利工程，大搞引水蓄水，做到塘满库平，为秋播浇底墒水作好准备。
    在“大抓肥料，为秋田和麦田备足追肥和底肥”的口号鼓舞下，全省每天出动三百四十多万人积肥造肥。7月份以来，二十多天已积各种肥料一千六百九十亿斤，除施秋田追肥外，积肥条件好的地区，已经开始为秋播压沤底肥。南阳专区提出7、8、9三个月积下农家肥八百亿斤，土化肥八亿斤，保证秋播作物丰产方亩施底肥五千斤到一万斤，一般田三千斤到五千斤。孟县大搞“万亩千池”沤浆肥运动，全县八万多个茅池，已有七万多个满浆，除已积七亿多斤用于秋田追肥外，现在正开始为秋播积沤底肥。
    为了有计划地更换和扩大良种面积，目前全省在留足选够种籽的基础上，正进行种子普查站队和良种调剂工作。全省计划调剂南大“2419”、平原“51”、白玉皮、内乡五号等优良品种五千万斤，这些品种具有丰产、抗锈、抗倒伏、耐水、耐肥、茎秆粗壮、多花等特点。普查之后，凡是选足留够优良品种的社、队主要是作好专仓保管工作，及时翻晒，不得动用；对留种虽足，但质量不好，品种单一的，将组织社与社、队与队之间的串换；对选的不够的社、队，国家将设法帮助解决，保证播种良种。
