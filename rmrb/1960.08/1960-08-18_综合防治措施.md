Comprehensive Prevention and Control Measures
Qiu Weifan

Thoroughly Control Aphid Damage

Chinese cabbage is most susceptible to viruses from sowing until it grows six leaves. Aphids are the carriers of viruses, so be sure not to let aphids enter the vegetable field. During this period, aphids have wings and are very active. If you don't observe carefully, it is difficult to find them. Some people think that there are not many aphids at this time (not as many as after the rosette stage or heading stage), so they do not pay attention to aphid control and prevention. This is a major loophole that is easily created in the prevention and control of the three major diseases.

In order to eliminate aphids, medicine must be applied during land preparation (sprinkle 6% 666 powder on the soil surface, three to four catties per mu), and then rake it flat. When the seeds are about to emerge, you can use 0.5% 666 powder, sprinkling two and a half to three catties per mu, or spray 6% wettable 666 mixed with two hundred catties of water on the ground. 666 has a strong odor, and aphids outside the field dare not come when the seedlings emerge, while aphids staying in the field will be killed. Before the Chinese cabbage grows six leaves, if it is dry, you should also spray 200 times wettable 6% 666 two or three times. If there is a lot of rain, you can reduce it to one or two times as appropriate (because aphids are not easy to move in rainy conditions).

Strictly Prevent Downy Mildew After Chinese Cabbage Heads

Downy mildew generally occurs in the early stage of Chinese cabbage heading. When some lesions are found in the vegetable field (especially in low-lying vegetable fields), it indicates that the disease is about to develop, so prevention and control must be carried out immediately. Currently effective agents include 65% "Daisen Zinc" and 65% "Shileite." These agents can be used after being dissolved in 700 times water. Generally, after the first spraying, spray again after seven or eight days. However, when there is a lot of rain or the disease is severe, it should be sprayed again after three or four days, two or three times. If there is only 4% "Daisen Zinc" powder, then it is better to use it for powder spraying. In areas where barium polysulfide is produced, one hundred times barium polysulfide solution can also be used for spraying. Using Bordeaux mixture is effective in preventing downy mildew, but it can easily cause drug damage to Chinese cabbage. Therefore, in areas with no experience in using it, learn successful usage experiences carefully. As long as the medicine is applied in a timely and thorough manner, downy mildew can be suppressed. The farmers' experience of irrigating with clean water after heavy rain also plays a certain role in suppressing the development of downy mildew. This is an advanced experience of controlling the microclimate by irrigating with clean water, and it can be used in combination with medication.

Do a Good Job of Drainage to Prevent Soft Rot

The key to preventing soft rot is to control the disease and do a good job of the drainage system. Regarding the method of controlling the disease, spraying 666 is still effective (method is the same as before). One of the important links in the drainage system is to build high ridges and plant vegetables on the ridge back. This has been widely used in North China. In addition, removing the initially appearing diseased vegetables can play a great role in eliminating the source of bacteria. This bacteria is spread when the vegetable field is irrigated, so diseased plants should be removed before irrigation.

    综合防治措施
    裘维蕃
    彻底控制蚜虫为害
    白菜从播种至长出六个叶子这一段时间内最容易感受病毒。蚜虫是病毒的传布者，因此一定不要让蚜虫进入菜地。这一时期的蚜虫有长翅的，活动性很大，不仔细观察，很难发现它们。有人认为这时蚜虫不多（不如莲座期或卷心期后多），因此，不注意治蚜及防蚜。这是防治三大病害上容易产生的一个大漏洞。
    为了消灭蚜虫，在整地时就要施药（把6％的666粉撒在土面，每亩三、四斤）然后耙平。种子快要出土时，可以用0.5％的666粉剂，每亩撒二斤半到三斤，或用6％的可湿性666加二百斤水喷布在地面上。666气味大，出苗时田外的蚜虫不敢来，而停留在田内的蚜虫则会被杀死。在白菜长出六个叶子前，如果天旱还要用二百倍的可湿性6％的666喷射二、三次，要是雨多，可以酌量减少到一、二次（因为多雨蚜虫不易活动）。
    白菜卷心后严防霜霉病
    霜霉病一般发生在白菜卷心初期。在菜地里（特别是低洼的菜地）发现一些病斑时，就预示病害即将发展，因此立刻要防治。目前有效的药剂有含65％的“代森锌”，65％的“什来特”。这些药剂用七百倍的水溶解后即可使用。一般在第一次喷打后隔七、八天再打一次。但雨多或病势猛时，应隔过三、四天再打，打它二、三次。如果只有含4％的“代森锌”粉，那么用作喷粉比较好。生产多硫化钡的地区，也可以使用一百倍的多硫化钡液喷布。使用波尔多液药剂对防治霜霉病是有效的，但容易使白菜发生药害。因此，在没有使用经验的地区要认真学习成功的使用经验。霜霉病只要打药及时，打得彻底是可以抑制下去的。农民在暴雨后压一次清水的经验，对于抑制霜霉病的发展也起一定的作用。这是通过压清水来控制小气候的一种先进经验，可以和打药结合起来运用。
    作好排水工作预防软腐病
    预防软腐病的关键在于控制病害和作好排水系统。关于控制病害的方法，仍旧以喷666为有效（方法同前）。排水系统中的重要环节之一就是起高垅，把菜种在垅背上。这在华北地区已普遍应用。此外拔除初次出现的病菜，对于消灭病菌来源能起很大的作用。这种细菌是菜地灌水时传布的，因此拔除病株应在灌水之前。
