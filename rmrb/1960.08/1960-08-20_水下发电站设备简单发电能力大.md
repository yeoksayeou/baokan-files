Advanced Science and Technology of Fraternal Countries

    Leningrad experts have designed an underwater power station where the units are installed in sealed underwater chambers. Using this method, the designed power generation capacity of the power station can be greatly increased.

    The sealed chamber of the power station resembles a rocket in shape, with the water turbine and generator installed inside. In this type of power station, there is no need to build machine rooms, and the hydropower station building and dam become a single integrated unit.

    This station will be built in the Volga-Baltic Waterway in the city of Cherepovets, an important center of the Soviet metallurgical industry. The equipment will be manufactured by the Leningrad Steel Plant and the "Electricity" Factory.

    水下发电站设备简单发电能力大
    列宁格勒专家们设计了一种水下发电站，这种发电站的机组装在水下的密封室里。采用这种方法，发电站的设计发电能力可以大大提高。
    发电站的密封室外形很像一个火箭，水轮机和发电机都装在密封室内。在这种发电站里不再需要建造机器间，而水电站建筑和坝也连成了单一的整体。
    这个站将建在苏联冶金业重要中心切列波维茨市的伏尔加河—波罗的海运河中。装备将由列宁格勒钢铁厂和“电力”工厂负责制造。
