Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 24th: Radio broadcasts from the Lao Fighting Forces today stated that the conspiracy of the ultra-pro-American Lao reactionary leader Phoumi Nosavan group to send troops to attack Vientiane has immediately met with fierce opposition from the armies, police, and people in various regions of Laos.

　　Nearly a company of Royal Lao Army troops in Kasy County have already deserted their camps to cooperate with the new government. Royal Lao Army troops in Xanakham County, Vientiane Province, refused to cooperate with the reactionary group. They said that if the Phoumi Nosavan group enters Vientiane, we will eliminate them first.

　　The radio station said that due to Phoumi Nosavan's preparations to send troops to attack Vientiane, the food supply work for the armies in various regions of Laos has come to a standstill. In many places, armies and police are opposing the conspiracy of the Phoumi Nosavan reactionary group due to a lack of food. In Saravane Province and Sam Neua Province, armies and police not only lack food but also cannot receive their wages. Police at the Ta Oi outpost in Saravane Province expressed their firm refusal to follow the Phoumi Nosavan reactionary group.

　　The radio station said that civil servants in Luang Prabang Province wrote letters opposing the reactionary group's conspiracy to make Laotians fight Laotians and demanded that they supply food.

　　The Lao Fighting Forces radio station said that wherever Phoumi Nosavan's troops arrive, the local people's armed forces rise up to oppose them. The radio station also reported that along the roads where Phoumi Nosavan's troops passed, the people adopted a scorched-earth policy, hiding their food in the forests, and the people have also dispersed, so that Phoumi's troops cannot find food to eat. A large number of leaflets and slogans calling on the reactionary troops to defect to the Souvanna Phouma government have also appeared in these areas.

　　This radio station called on the Lao people, armies, police, and civil servants to join the Lao Patriotic Front in promoting the anti-American struggle for national salvation, supporting the new government, and defeating the conspiracy of the reactionary group.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 24th: Radio broadcasts from the Lao Fighting Forces today stated that people in various regions of Laos continue to hold rallies to support the new government and the coup committee.

　　The radio station broadcast that on August 21st, more than 1,000 people from Ban Nong, Pha Do, Ban Xa, and other villages in Bassac District, Luang Prabang Province, held a large-scale rally in the pouring rain. The slogans they held high read: "Oppose the intervention of American imperialism," "Support the policy line of genuine peaceful neutrality, achieving national harmony, and bringing democracy, freedom, tranquility, and happiness to the people, as proposed by the government and the coup committee."

　　The chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front's Bassac District Committee delivered a speech at the meeting, warmly supporting the statement issued by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front on August 9th, and severely condemning the crimes committed by the running dogs of American imperialism in Bassac District, strongly opposing the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group's creation of fratricidal warfare among Laotians. He said that if the Phoumi Nosavan group dares to oppose the people, the people will resolutely crush them. The attendees indignantly shouted: "American imperialism get out!" "Oppose the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group!" "Support the Souvanna Phouma government and the coup committee!"

　　A soldier from the Royal Lao Army spoke at the meeting, reviewing his past mistakes of following the traitorous group, denouncing the crimes of American imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan group, and calling on officers and soldiers of the Royal Lao Army to resolutely oppose the orders of Phoumi Nosavan and turn their guns to eliminate the reactionary group.

　　The masses attending the meeting then held a demonstration. When the procession passed the stronghold of the Royal Lao Army, some officers and soldiers also joined the procession. (Attached Picture)

    老挝军民反对诺萨万集团叛国阴谋
    各地人民继续集会支持新政府　人民武装力量到处打击叛乱军队
    很多王国军警拒绝同叛国集团合作　　卡西县一连部队投奔新政府
    新华社河内24日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，极端亲美的老挝反动头子富米·诺萨万集团出兵进攻万象的阴谋，立即遭到老挝各地军队、警察和人民的激烈反对。
    卡西县的近一个连的王国军队已经逃离营地同新政府合作。万象省沙那堪县的王国军队拒绝同反动集团合作。他们说，如果富米·诺萨万集团进入万象，我们就先消灭他们。
    电台说，由于富米·诺萨万准备出兵进攻万象，老挝各地军队的粮食供应工作陷于停滞。许多地方的军队和警察因缺乏粮食，正在纷纷反对富米·诺萨万反动集团的阴谋。在沙拉湾省和桑怒省，军队和警察不但缺乏粮食，而且工资也领不到。沙拉湾省他松据点的警察表示坚决拒绝跟随富米·诺萨万反动集团。
    电台说，琅勃拉邦省的职员写信反对反动集团使老挝人打老挝人的阴谋，同时要求他们供应粮食。
    寮国战斗部队电台说，富米·诺萨万的军队到达那里，那里的人民武装力量都起来反对他们。电台还报道，在富米·诺萨万军队经过的地方沿路人民坚壁清野，把粮食藏到森林里，人民也都已疏散，使富米军队找不到饭吃。这些地方还出现了大批呼吁反动军队投奔富马政府的传单和标语。
    这家电台号召老挝人民、军队、警察、职员同老挝爱国战线党一道促进反美救国斗争，支持新政府，击败反动集团的阴谋。
    新华社河内24日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，老挝各地人民继续举行集会支持新政府和政变委员会。
    电台广播说，琅勃拉邦省巴桑县奔农、发多、奔车等乡一千多人8月21日冒着大雨举行了声势浩大的集会。他们高举的标语上写着：“反对美帝国主义的干涉”、“支持政府和政变委员会所提出的真正和平中立、实现民族和睦、为人民带来民主自由、安宁和幸福的政策路线”。
    老挝爱国战线党巴桑县委员会主席在会上发表讲话，热烈支持老挝爱国战线党中央委员会8月9日发表的声明，并且严厉谴责了美帝国主义的走狗在巴桑县所犯下的罪行，强烈反对富米·诺萨万卖国集团制造老挝人之间的互相残杀。他说，如果富米·诺萨万集团敢于反对人民，人民就坚决粉碎他们。到会者激愤地高呼：“美帝国主义滚出去！”“反对富米·诺萨万叛国集团！”“支持富马政府和政变委员会！”
    王国军队的一名士兵在会上讲话时，检讨了他过去跟着卖国集团走的错误，控诉了美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万集团的罪行，并号召王国军队官兵坚决反对富米·诺萨万的命令，倒转枪口消灭反动集团。
    到会群众随后举行游行示威。游行队伍经过王国军队的据点时，一部分军官和士兵也参加了游行。（附图片）
