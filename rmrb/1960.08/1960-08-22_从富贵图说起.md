    Starting with the "Wealth and Prosperity" Chart
    Li Lin, First Secretary of the CCP Ping Shun County Committee, Shanxi Province
    July 15th was a clear day after the rain. The valley had a special flavor, and the air was exceptionally fresh. The crops that had triumphed over the drought demon showed a scene of harvest. Laughter and Shangdang clapper opera sounds continuously came from the fields.
    That day, we took a car to the hometown of Comrade Guo Yu'en, a national model worker—Chuandi Management Area, Chengguan Commune. Upon entering the village, the first thing that caught our eyes was a huge and eye-catching mural chart: Introduction to Basic Conditions, Production Development Chart, This Year's Overall Leap Forward Table, Know the Year in Advance, Cost Accounting Table, Mass Economic Analysis Activity Table, Commune Member Labor Leap Forward List, and so on. From production and investment to distribution, from individual, collective to the state, the entire production was connected. From the wall chart, it was clear that the Chuandi Management Area was trying every possible means, carefully calculating, increasing production, reducing costs, increasing income, and living frugally. We carefully looked at it from beginning to end. Suddenly, a commune member walked up from behind, carrying a load of melons and vegetables, greeting us as he walked, saying: "With these charts, we have a bottom line in our hearts. The commune members are very happy with these charts. Everyone says this is the 'Wealth and Prosperity' Chart for living."
    We had just turned the corner of the supply and marketing cooperative when we happened to meet Comrade Guo Yu'en, the director of the commune. Without going into the office, we went to the fields to see the river bend land of Sanliwandi, the depression land of Getai Gou, and also climbed to the top of the mountain to see the terraced fields. The overall impression was that whether large or small, far or near, good or bad land, the crops were generally growing robustly, with dark color, thick stalks, lush leaves, and evenness. This gave us a new idea. The old rule of the mountainous areas over the years was that the yield of nearby beach land was high, and the yield of distant mountain land was low, but the mountain area took up most of it, the labor investment was large, and the yield was very low. People were unwilling to plant these lands, which was a major problem affecting increased production in the mountainous areas. Now, why do the crops grow so balanced here, why do the distant and bad lands grow good crops, and how do the backward lands catch up with the advanced lands? So, we asked Comrade Guo Yu'en to answer this question. Comrade Yu'en pointed to a terraced field on the back mountain of Getai Gou and said: "The yield of mountain land is small, and it takes a lot of effort. In the past, planting one mu of this land required at least fifty or sixty workdays, and the labor for transporting fertilizer alone took more than thirty. The edges collapsed and were rebuilt every year, the soil layer was barren, and it was vulnerable to drought and flood. In the autumn, if you're not careful, the voles will eat up the crops. "The commune members said, 'The cost of distant mountain land is high, and you can't get rich even if you wear out your shoulders.' In the past few years, the contract output could not be assigned every year, and the production teams didn't want to plant distant lands, saying that distant lands had no future. Based on this situation, the Party branch consulted with the old farmers and summarized the experience of turning seven mu of distant land in Dashi Ao from low yield to high yield. Everyone believed that distant land was not bad land, mainly because the treatment was unfair in the past, saying that distant land was treated like a stepchild, without enough fertilizer, how could it produce more grain. It was unanimously proposed to implement the method of three circles to the field and accumulate fertilizer on the spot. As a result, the situation has changed. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu has increased from more than thirty loads in the past to more than one hundred and forty loads. This year, the labor per mu can be reduced from sixty or seventy in the past to twenty or thirty, and the saved labor can be used for land processing. The conclusion people have reached is that distant and bad land has great potential, as long as it is processed and fertilized, there will be grain. In the past, one workday of distant land produced a little more than two catties of grain, but now one workday produces twenty catties of grain. The cost is reduced by two times, and the production efficiency is increased by ten times. In the entire management area, four hundred and fifty mu of distant land has built forty-eight livestock circles and more than five hundred manure ponds in the past three years. Most of the land has manure pits. In this way, saving labor just from delivering manure alone saves more than two thousand workdays. Everyone says this is a good way to increase production in mountainous areas."
    We had just sat down in the office when Comrade Guo Jianting rushed in from the field, covered in sweat. We asked about the matter of running the commune diligently and thriftily. This accountant, who was commended by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, casually told us a few stories, which sounded quite interesting. First of all, the light is not turned on unless everyone is present. One night in the winter of 1958, Yang Gong Lisanfu went to the management area to add oil. Comrade Guo Jianting only added half a lamp. This Yang Gong said: "The cadres are sitting at home, lighting up bright glass cover lamps. Look how big the lamp heads are. We shepherds haven't even been given a small ink bottle lamp full, so you're only being frugal with us." Jianting Comrade had lived a poor life since he was a child and felt that this old man's criticism was very correct. From then on, a cover lamp was lit when working in the office, and a small oil lamp was lit when not working, and it was also stipulated that the light would not be turned on unless everyone was present. Last year, only fifteen catties of kerosene were used throughout the year, and only more than three cents of kerosene were used every day. Secondly, the story of using waste paper as receipts. In January 1958, Comrade Jianting opened a receipt for commune member Guo Guoxian written on white powder paper. Guoxian looked at the receipt with dissatisfaction and said: "How beautiful it is, and you only wrote these few big characters, you don't feel bad spending the commune's money?" How sharp this criticism of the commune cadres was! Comrade Jianting accepted this criticism. He thought: "Yes! The commune members earn a few cents for a day's work, I don't know how much sweat they shed, and the cadres waste several workdays with a loose hand. You can't look down on small money, people often say: 'Accumulation will make more, and small money can do great things'. Not even one cent of the commune member's money can be wasted for nothing." From then on, it was stipulated that the commune would use waste paper to issue receipts, and use old account books as new account books. One set of account books saved the commune twenty-eight yuan. In two years, only twenty sheets of glossy paper were used. Dip pen nibs are also sharpened and used when they are worn out, and then used again after sharpening. Two dip pen nibs have been used by Comrade Jianting for two years and are still in use. In addition, the matter of replacing charcoal fire with coal fire in the office was also very interesting. Originally, a large charcoal fire was often burned in the commune's office in winter. Later, the cadres of the management area and the commune members fought hard and suffered from the cold together, feeling that their office was a bit special, so they replaced the charcoal fire with coal fire; originally, it was burned day and night, and later it was changed to seal during the day and light at night, light it when there is something to do, seal it when there is nothing to do, which saved a lot of coal. The cadres of this management area regarded the property of the commune members as their own, adhered to the method of living a poor life in the past, cherished the things of the commune, and did not let a cent be wasted for nothing. Speaking of this, there is also a small thing that is also attracting attention. Comrade Jianting said: "One day, when binding documents, a pin was dropped on the ground, because the ground was soil, it took a long time to find it." You see how much they cherish the property of the commune. The cadres of this management area are like this, carefully calculating, constantly listening to the opinions of the masses, and adhering to the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily. In 1959, the entire management cost was only thirty-four yuan and five jiao, accounting for 0.8 per thousand of the total income.
    The commune members praised this spirit of running the commune diligently and thriftily:
    Running the commune diligently and thriftily is a family treasure,
    The People's Commune cannot do without it;
    Whoever forgets the family treasure,
    Life is guaranteed not to be good.

    从富贵图说起
    中共山西平顺县委第一书记　李琳
    7月15日，是一个雨后的晴天，山谷里显得别有一番风味，空气格外新鲜，从和旱魔斗争中胜利了的庄稼，显出一幅丰收的景象。地里不断传出社员们的欢笑声和上党梆子的声音。
    这天，我们乘车到了全国著名劳动模范郭玉恩同志的家乡——城关公社川底管理区。一进村，首先映入眼帘的就是巨幅醒目的壁画图表：基本情况介绍图、生产发展图、今年全面跃进表、一年早知道、成本核算表、群众经济分析活动表、社员劳动跃进榜，等等。从生产、投资到分配，从个人、集体到国家，把整个生产连接在一起。从墙表上明显地看出川底管理区千方百计，精打细算，提高生产，降低成本，增加收入，勤俭过日子的办法。我们从头到尾仔细地看了下来，忽然从背后走来了一位社员，担着一担瓜菜边走边向我们招呼说：有了这些图表，俺们心里就有了底底，社员都很乐意这几张图表，大家说这是过日子的“富贵图”。
    我们刚转过供销商店的门口，正好碰上社主任郭玉恩同志。没有进办公室，我们便到地里去看，看了三里湾的河湾地，到过圪台沟沟凹地，还登上山顶，看了层层叠叠的梯田。总的印象是，不论大地小地，远地近地，好地坏地庄稼长的普遍茁壮、色黑、秆粗、叶肥、匀实。这使我们产生了一个新的念头，历年山地的老规距是近地滩地产量高，远地山地产量低，可是山区远地占去了大部，投工又大，产量很低，人们都不愿种这些地，这是影响山区增产的一个大问题。现在这里为什么庄稼长的这样平衡，远地坏地为什么长起了好庄稼，后进地怎样赶上了先进地？于是，就请郭玉恩同志回答这个问题。玉恩同志指点着圪台沟后山上的一片梯田说：种山地产量小，费劲大，过去种这一亩地至少得五六十个工，光运肥工就得三十多个，边岸年年塌、年年垒，土层瘠薄，旱涝不得，秋天一不小心，毛圪狑就把庄稼吃光了。社员们说：“山地远地成本大，磨破肩膀也发不了家。”前几年每年包产包不下去，生产队都不想种远地，说远地没赶头。党支部根据这个情况，和老农作了商量，总结了大石凹七亩远地由低产变高产的经验，大家认为远地并不是坏地，主要是过去待遇不公，说远地遭上后娘，吃不上肥，怎能多打粮。一致提出实行三圈到田，就地积肥的办法。这样一来，情况变啦，每亩上肥由过去的三十多担增加到一百四十多担，今年每亩用工可由过去的六七十个，降到二三十个，省出的工用到土地加工上。人们得到的结论是，远地坏地潜力大，只要加工加肥就有粮。过去远地一个工生产二斤多粮食，现在一个工就生产二十斤粮食，成本降低两倍，生产效率提高十倍，全管理区四百五十亩远地，三年来共修畜圈四十八个，粪池五百多个，大部土地有了粪坑，这样光送粪一项就省二千多个工，人人都说这是山地增产的一个好办法。
    我们刚坐到办公室里，郭建廷同志就冒着满头大汗，从地里跑了进来。我们问到了勤俭办社的事情。这位受到中共山西省委表扬的会计，随便给我们谈了几个故事，听起来觉着怪有意思。首先是，人不齐不点灯。1958年冬季的一个晚上，羊工路三富到管理区添油，郭建廷同志只给添了半灯，这位羊工说：干部坐在家里，点着明晃晃的玻璃罩子灯，你看灯头多大啦，俺们放羊的连个小墨水瓶的灯也没给添满，就光在俺们身上节约啦。建廷同志从小就过的是穷日子，感到这老汉批评得很对。从此，办公时点罩子灯，不办公了就点小油灯，还规定人不齐不点灯。去年全年只用了十五斤煤油，每天只用三钱多煤油。其次说到废纸作单据的故事。1958年1月，建廷同志给社员郭国先开了一张单据是用白粉纸写的。国先瞅着这张单据不满意地说：“白光光的多漂亮啊，就写了这么几个大字，花社里的钱就不觉着心疼？”这话对社干部的批评是多么尖锐啊！建廷同志接受了这个批评。他这样想：是呀！社员劳动一天赚几个钱，不知流多少汗，干部松松手就把几个劳动日浪费掉了，不能看不起小钱，人常说：“积少会成多，小钱能办大事”。社员的一文钱也不能白白浪费掉。从此，便规定社里用废纸开单据，利用旧账簿作新账簿使用，一套账就给社节省了二十八元钱，二年时间，只用过二十张油光纸。醮水笔尖也是用的不行了就磨，磨了再用，两个醮水笔尖在建廷同志手里用过了二年，现在还一直使用。另外，还说了办公室用炭火改煤火的事，也很有意思。原来社里的办公室里冬天经常生着大炭火，后来管理区干部和社员一块苦战受冻，觉着自己办公室有点特殊，于是就把炭火改成煤火；原来是白天黑夜一直烧，以后改成白天封夜里着，有事着无事封，这样节约了很多煤炭。这个管理区的干部把社员的财产都当作自己的一样，坚持过去过穷日子的办法，爱惜社里的东西，不让一文钱白浪费掉。说到这里，还有个小事情，也是引人注意的。建廷同志说：“有一天在装订文件时，将一个大头针掉在地下，因为地下是土，找了好半天才算找到。”你看，他们对社的财产是多么爱惜。这个管理区的干部就这样，精打细算，不断地听取群众的意见，坚持了勤俭办社的方针。1959年全年的管理费用只用了三十四元五角，占总收入的千分之零点八。
    社员们歌颂这种勤俭办社的精神说：
    勤俭办社传家宝，
    人民公社离不了；
    谁要忘了传家宝，
    日子保险过不好。
