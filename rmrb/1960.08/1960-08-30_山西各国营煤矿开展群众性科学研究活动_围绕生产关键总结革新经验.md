Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 29th: State-owned coal mines in Shanxi Province are vigorously coordinating and promoting the achievements of the technical revolution in the current campaign to increase production and practice economy.

At present, all coal mines are carrying out mass scientific research activities centered on the key aspects of mining, excavation, and transportation in current production, in order to summarize, appraise, and improve decentralized innovation achievements, and then apply them in a coordinated and universal manner. Larger coal mines such as Datong, Yangquan, Xishan, and Fenxi have organized scientific research groups composed mainly of engineering and technical personnel and veteran workers, formulated scientific research plans, and regarded technical innovation experiences that are suitable for the mine's production conditions and truly effective in production as the focus of current scientific research. The Yangquan Mining Bureau has also organized a promotion team to mobilize the masses to identify the achievements of the technical revolution, and apply the experiences that have been identified and coordinated to production. The Lu'an Mining Bureau researched and promoted the "knife-pillar type coal mining method with depicted anchor supports" created by workers, and achieved "three highs" (high output, high efficiency, high equipment utilization rate), "two lows" (low material consumption, low cost), and "one good" (good safety) results, achieving a large-scale bumper harvest. Through scientific research, the Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine identified two coal mining methods suitable for local conditions from a large number of new coal mining methods. After promotion, the output of each working face increased by half compared with the past.

All coal mines are also vigorously promoting innovative machinery for the weak links in in-mine transportation. After the Xishan Coal Mine coordinated and promoted various self-made transportation tools, it basically realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of material transportation. Seventeen working faces in the Yangquan Mining Bureau promoted and used monorail car material transportation, which greatly saved labor. Coal mines in Datong, Yangquan, Xishan, Lu'an and other places have also universally implemented the advanced experience of vigorously developing mining area coal bunkers, effectively solving the contradiction between coal mining and transportation.

    山西各国营煤矿开展群众性科学研究活动
    围绕生产关键总结革新经验
    新华社太原29日电　山西省各国营煤矿在当前的增产节约运动中，大力配套推广技术革命成果。
    各煤矿目前都围绕当前生产中采掘和运输的关键开展群众性的科学研究活动，以便把分散的革新成果加以总结鉴定和提高，然后配成套普遍推广。大同、阳泉、西山、汾西等较大煤矿，都以工程技术人员、老工人为主组织了科学研究小组，制订了科学研究规划，把适合本矿生产条件而且在生产上确有成效的技术革新经验，当作当前科学研究的重点。阳泉矿务局还组织了推广队，一面发动群众鉴定技术革命成果，一面把经过鉴定配套的经验，应用到生产中去。潞安矿务局研究推广了工人创造的描拴支架刀柱式采煤法，取得了“三高”（产量高，效率高，设备利用率高）、“二低”（材料消耗低、成本低）、“一好”（安全好）的成绩，获得了大面积丰收。太原西山煤矿通过科学研究，从大批采煤新方法中找出了适合当地情况的两种采煤方法，推广后，单位工作面的产量比过去提高一半。
    各煤矿还针对矿内运输薄弱环节大力推广革新机具。西山煤矿把各种自制的运输工具配套推广以后，基本上实现了运料机械化和半机械化。阳泉矿务局有十七个工作面推广使用了单轨车运料，大大节省了劳动力。大同、阳泉、西山、潞安等煤矿，还普遍推行了大搞采区煤仓的先进经验。有效地解决了采煤与运输相互影响的矛盾。
