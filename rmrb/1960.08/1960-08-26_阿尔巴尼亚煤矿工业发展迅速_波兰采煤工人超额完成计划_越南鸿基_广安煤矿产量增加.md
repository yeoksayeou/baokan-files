Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 24th: The Albanian Telegraph Agency reported that the Albanian coal industry has made great achievements during the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960). Currently, Albania's coal production every five days is equivalent to one year's production before liberation. This year's coal production will be more than 1.5 times that of 1955.

Due to such rapid growth, although the demand for coal from industrial and mining enterprises continues to increase, Albania's coal industry production can still meet domestic needs.

Albania's per capita coal production has long exceeded that of its neighboring countries. According to the 1957 production figures, Albania averaged 160.7 kilograms of coal per resident, while Italy only had 7.9 kilograms, and Greece had 123.3 kilograms.

During the Second Five-Year Plan, many tasks in Albanian coal mines have been mechanized.

During the next Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), Albania's coal industry will have even greater development. By 1965, its coal production will increase by more than 33% compared to this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 25th: According to local newspapers, as of August 22nd, Polish coal miners had overfulfilled their plan by mining two million tons of coal, equivalent to the total amount of coal overproduced throughout last year.

These achievements are the result of Polish miners paying attention to technological innovation, improving labor organization, installing many coal mining and conveying machines underground, and improving underground transportation.

It is estimated that by the end of this year, Polish miners can overproduce another one million tons of coal for the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: According to a Vietnam News Agency report on August 20th, the total output of the Hongji-Guangan coal mine in northern Vietnam in 1959 reached 2,187,214 tons, an increase of 547,200 tons compared to the highest annual output during the French colonial rule in 1939.

This largest coal mine in Indochina was occupied by French colonialists for nearly seventy years, beginning in 1886. The colonialists plundered more than 50 million tons of coal from there. By 1948, they had obtained a net profit of 1,335,554,000 francs—148 times the initial investment of 9 million francs.

In 1955, when the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam took over, the annual output of this coal mine was only more than 560,000 tons. In the past five years, the Hongji-Guangan coal mine has been equipped with modern equipment aided by the Soviet Union, China, and Czechoslovakia. The number of mining machines has increased fourfold, and the number of transport vehicles has increased ninefold.

Since becoming the property of the people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the output of this coal mine has been continuously increasing. Its output in the first half of this year is equal to the total output of the entire year of 1956.

The labor productivity of the miners has rapidly increased. The average daily output per worker in the open-pit coal seams of the Hongji coal mine has increased from 2.83 tons in 1955 to 5.8 tons in 1959.

    阿尔巴尼亚煤矿工业发展迅速
    波兰采煤工人超额完成计划　越南鸿基—广安煤矿产量增加
    新华社地拉那24日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚煤炭工业在第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）期间取得了巨大的成就。目前，阿尔巴尼亚每五天的煤产量就相当于解放以前的一年的产量。今年的煤产量将为1955年的一点五倍多。
    由于有这样迅速的增长，所以尽管工矿企业对煤炭的需要不断增加，但阿尔巴尼亚的煤炭工业的生产仍然可以满足国内的需要。
    阿尔巴尼亚按人口平均计算的煤产量早已超过了它的邻国。根据1957年的产量计算，阿尔巴尼亚每个居民平均有一百六十点七公斤煤，而意大利仅有七点九公斤，希腊有一百二十三点三公斤。
    在第二个五年计划期间，阿尔巴尼亚煤矿中的许多工作已实现了机械化。
    在下一个五年计划（1961—1965年）期间，阿尔巴尼亚的煤炭工业将有更大的发展。到1965年，它的煤产量将比今年增长33％以上。
    新华社华沙25日电　据此间报纸报道，截至8月22日为止，波兰煤矿工人已超计划开采了二百万吨煤，相当于去年全年超计划生产的煤的总数。
    这些成就的取得，是波兰矿工注意技术革新、改善劳动组织，在井下安装不少采煤和运煤机器、改善井下运输的结果。
    据估计，到今年年底，波兰矿工可以为国家再超计划开采一百万吨煤。
    新华社河内电　据越南通讯社20日报道，越南北方鸿基—广安煤矿1959年总产量达到二百一十八万七千二百一十四吨，比1939年法国殖民者统治时期的最高年产量增加五十四万七千二百吨。
    这个印度支那最大的煤矿从1886年起被法国殖民主义者霸占了将近七十年。殖民主义者从那里掠夺了五千多万吨煤。到1948年，他们获得了十三亿三千五百五十四万法郎的净利——为九百万法郎创办投资的一百四十八倍。
    1955年，越南民主共和国政府接管的时候，这个煤矿的年产量只有五十六万多吨。五年来，鸿基—广安煤矿装备了苏联、中国和捷克斯洛伐克援助的现代化设备。开采机增加了四倍，运输车增加了九倍。
    这个煤矿自从成为人民的财产以后，在越南劳动党的领导下，产量不断增加。它今年上半年的产量等于1956年全年的总和。
    矿工们的劳动生产率迅速提高。鸿基煤矿露天煤层每个工人的平均日产量已从1955年的二点八三吨提高到1959年的五点八吨。
