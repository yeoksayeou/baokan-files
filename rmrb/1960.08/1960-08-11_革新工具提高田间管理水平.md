Innovating Tools to Improve Field Management Level
Commentator of this newspaper

    In order to strengthen the front line of agricultural production, various localities are recently mobilizing more labor to invest in field production. This is an extremely important measure to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year. While concentrating labor to strengthen the front line of production, we must also pay attention to another issue, which is to vigorously innovate field management tools. A strong labor force combined with advanced production tools will enable us to more effectively accelerate the progress of field management and improve the level of field management.
    This autumn's field management tasks are more arduous than in the past. Since spring, we have made great efforts to expand the sown area, and have reclaimed and expanded a large amount of wasteland. Now we must manage all the crops that have been planted. This year, there are large areas of high-yield fields in various places, and the management of these fields requires more refinement and more compliance with the standards of garden-style farming. In the first half of the year, drought was severe in most parts of North China and some other areas. Many spring-sown or summer-sown crops were planted quickly to combat the drought. These crops, due to poor congenital conditions, especially need to be strengthened with early nurturing and management. In short, there are many things to be done, and the time is very short. To complete such arduous field management tasks, it is not enough to simply increase the labor force. We should also seek labor from tool reform and put all effective new field management tools into use as soon as possible.
    Many field management operations are very labor-intensive. Innovating field management tools is not only to improve labor efficiency, but also to reduce the physical labor burden of farmers. Taking paddy field production as an example, people kneel or squat and use their hands to weed rice seedlings, only able to weed a few points of land a day; if weeding machines are used to remove weeds, not only can efficiency be increased several times, but labor intensity can also be greatly reduced. The Shuangshi Agricultural Tool Factory in Rong County, Sichuan, created a boat-shaped rice seedling weeding tool. It only requires three kilograms of wood and one or two ounces of iron nails to make one, and the value is only about five jiao. Using it to weed rice seedlings, one person can weed five mu of rice paddies a day, and the work efficiency is four or five times higher than the old-fashioned manual operation, which is welcomed by the members of the people's communes in Rong County. When they used this new tool, they composed a jingle: "Weeding tool, really good, light and flexible and small, doesn't wet hands, doesn't bend the waist, the field is flat and the mud is fine and weeds are removed, cheap and good and high work efficiency!"
    The more tense the production, the more we must vigorously reform tools. This is an important experience that everyone has learned in the past two years. At present, production is pressing in every aspect. If any operation cannot keep up with the season, it will affect the effect of increasing production. The most valuable thing in innovating field management tools is speed. We must make a decision, do it when we say it, and not waste time, waiting and watching. Quite a few advanced field management tools have been created in the past few years and recently. The problem now is, first of all, to immediately put all existing advanced tools into use, and at the same time, to modify them while working in the production process, combining creation and promotion. After the completion of rice transplanting, Guizhou Province immediately launched a movement to manufacture and promote cultivation tools, mainly weeding rakes. Most areas of the province adopted the method of manufacturing, testing, appraising, and immediately promoting them. By the end of June, the province had promoted more than 1.8 million pieces of weeding rakes, fertilizer applicators, insecticide applicators, and water lifting tools. After the completion of rice transplanting, the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture immediately converted more than 12,000 rice transplanting professional teams into weeding professional teams. More than 100,000 rice transplanters in the province put down their rice transplanters and picked up their weeding rakes. They learned while doing, and quickly became skilled weeding experts. This fact shows that as long as the method is correct and the action is rapid, tool reform can also be carried out effectively in this tense production season. Local leading organs should quickly take up this work. The more effective the tool reform, the better the field management tasks will be completed.

    革新工具提高田间管理水平
    本报评论员
    为了加强农业生产第一线，最近各地正调动更多的劳动力投入田间生产，这是争取今年农业丰收的一个极其重要的措施。在集中劳动力加强生产第一线的同时，我们还要注意另一个问题，就是大力革新田间管理工具。强大的劳动力与先进的生产工具结合起来，我们就能更有效地加快田间管理的进度，提高田间管理的水平。
    今年秋季的田间管理任务比过去更繁重。春天以来，我们曾经尽了很大努力去扩大播种面积，开垦和扩种了大量荒地，现在必须把所有已经种上的农作物都管理起来。今年各地都有大面积丰产田，这些田的管理工作要求更加精细，更加符合园田化的标准。上半年，华北大部地区和若干其他地区干旱严重，不论春播作物或是夏播作物，有很多是抗旱抢种上的，这些作物由于先天条件不好，特别需要后天及早加强培育管理。总之，应做的事情很多，而时间又很短促，要完成如此繁重的田间管理任务，光靠增加劳动力是不够的，还应当向工具改革要劳动力，把一切用之有效的田间管理新工具赶快全部使用起来。
    田间管理的许多作业劳动强度很大，革新田间管理工具，不但是为了提高劳动效率，也为了减轻农民的体力劳动负担。拿水田生产来说，人们跪着或蹲着用手薅秧、拔草，一天只能薅几分田；如果使用耘禾器除草，不仅效率可以提高好几倍，劳动强度也可大大减轻。四川荣县双石农具厂创制了一种船型薅秧器，只要三公斤木材、一两铁钉，就能造一部，价值只有五角钱左右。用它薅秧一人一天能薅五亩稻田，工效比旧式手工作业提高四、五倍，受到荣县各人民公社社员们的欢迎。他们在使用这个新工具的时候，编了一首顺口溜：“薅秧器，真正好，轻便灵活又小巧，不湿手，不弯腰，田平泥绒又除草，价廉物美工效高！”
    越是生产紧张，越要大力改革工具，这是近两年来大家体会到的一条重要经验。当前生产样样逼人，哪一项作业跟不上季节，都会影响增产效果。革新田间管理工具最贵迅速，要下个决心，说干就干，不可蹉跎时光，观望等待。过去几年和最近期间创造的先进的田间管理工具已经不少了，现在的问题，首先是把已有的先进工具立即全部使用起来，同时也要在生产过程中边干边改，把创制和推广结合起来。贵州省在插秧完成以后，立即掀起制造、推广以薅秧耙为主的中耕工具运动。全省大部地区采取边制造、边试验、边鉴定和随即推广的办法，到6月底，全省就推广了薅秧耙、追肥器、杀虫器和提水工具等一百八十多万件。黔南布依族苗族自治州在插秧结束后，立即把一万二千多个插秧专业队转为薅秧专业队，全省十万多名插秧机手放下了插秧机，就扛起了薅秧耙，边干边学，很快就成为熟练的薅秧能手。这个事实说明，只要方法对头，行动迅速，在这个生产紧张的季节，同样可以有效地进行工具改革。各地领导机关应当赶快把这项工作抓起来，工具改革越有成效，田间管理任务就会完成得越好。
