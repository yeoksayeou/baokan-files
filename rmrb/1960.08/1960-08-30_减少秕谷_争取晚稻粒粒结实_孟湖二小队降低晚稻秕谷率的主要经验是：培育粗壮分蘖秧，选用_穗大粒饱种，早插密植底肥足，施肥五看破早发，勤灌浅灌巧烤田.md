The main experiences of the Menghu Second Team in reducing the empty grain rate of late rice are: cultivating strong tillering seedlings, selecting seeds with large ears and full grains, early transplanting with dense planting and sufficient base fertilizer, applying fertilizer based on "five observations" for early growth, and diligent irrigation with shallow watering and skillful field drying.

Editor's Note: The provinces in the Yangtze River basin are one of the main late rice producing areas in China. Due to the influence of climate and cultivation techniques, the late rice here often has a certain proportion of rice grains that cannot be filled. Therefore, taking measures to reduce the empty grain rate has become a universally noteworthy issue in the late rice producing areas of the Yangtze River basin. The news about the Menghu Second Team reducing the empty grain rate published in this newspaper today provides beneficial experience for studying and solving this problem, for your reference.

Hangzhou, August 29th (Our Dispatch) - Reducing the empty grain rate of continuous cropping late rice is an important link in achieving late rice surpassing early rice. The Menghu Second Team of the Yongfu Production Team in Xucun Commune, Haining County, Zhejiang Province, has accumulated a set of successful experiences in this regard. They are now seizing the time to strengthen field management, promote early growth and early maturity, and create conditions for further reducing the empty grain rate and striving to harvest more late rice.

Since 1956, when the Menghu Second Team began planting continuous cropping late rice, the area has expanded year by year, and the yield has increased year by year. They have achieved late rice surpassing early rice for four consecutive years. They have initially mastered the experience of reducing the empty grain rate, which mainly includes: "Cultivating strong tillering seedlings, selecting high-yielding seeds with large ears and full grains, early transplanting with dense planting and sufficient base fertilizer, deep plowing with careful management and high quality, applying fertilizer based on 'five observations' for early growth, diligent irrigation with shallow watering and skillful field drying, early weeding with careful weeding to remove all weeds, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests to avoid damage." Last year, this team conducted an on-site survey of thirty-three mu of continuous cropping late rice in sixteen representative fields. The empty grain rate had been reduced to 6.34%, which was about 50% lower than the average empty grain rate of 9.3% of the entire production team, and about 60% lower than the average empty grain rate of the entire county. Due to the reduction of the empty grain rate, the yield of rice per mu can be increased by more than fifty jin.

When they started planting continuous cropping late rice in 1956, they did not realize that continuous cropping late rice, due to its shorter growth period than single-season late rice, must be fertilized and managed early to promote the growth of early development. Instead, they used the method of cultivating single-season late rice to manage continuous cropping late rice. As a result, the rice seedlings grew slowly, with excessive growth in the later period, delayed heading, lodging after returning to green, and eighteen mu and two fen of continuous cropping late rice had an empty grain rate as high as 25% or more. However, there were also two mu and three fen that did not lodge, with large ears and many grains, full grains, and an empty grain rate of only 8%, and the yield per mu was more than one hundred jin higher. What was the reason for this? The commune members recalled that this field was applied with twenty dan of sheep manure ash per mu as base fertilizer during transplanting. At the same time, due to late transplanting, there were surplus seedlings, and 250,000 seedlings were transplanted per mu. When topdressing, seeing that the rice was growing well, another twenty dan of "silkworm pupa water" was applied per mu. Due to the base fertilizer and early topdressing, the tillering was fast and the growth was good, and there was no lodging; because the "silkworm pupa water" contained oil, it also inhibited the harm of rice planthoppers, thereby obtaining a high yield. The commune members learned from this field and applied more than twenty dan of base fertilizer per mu to forty-eight mu of continuous cropping late rice during transplanting in 1957. However, at this time, they had not fully grasped the growth law of continuous cropping late rice, and one-sidedly accepted the lessons of lodging in 1956, adopting the method of applying less or no topdressing, and only applied tillering fertilizer and ear fertilizer to three mu and one fen of cadre experimental fields. As a result, the cadre experimental fields with topdressing yielded five hundred jin per mu, while the forty-five mu without topdressing did not lodge, and the empty grain rate was reduced to some extent, but the yield per mu was only four hundred and twenty jin, which was eighty jin less than the cadre experimental fields. From this fact, the commune members gained experience. They said: "If you grow well before the hot season, you get the grain before autumn, if you grow late, only heads but does not fill." This shows that continuous cropping late rice must be managed and fertilized early to promote early growth. If you grow well enough before the "end of heat", and heading before the "autumnal equinox", the grain filling rate will be high; if you relax the management in the early stage, causing late development after the "end of heat" and heading after the "autumnal equinox", it will be subject to early low temperature invasion, only heading but not filling, or the empty grain rate will be greatly increased. Last year, this team followed this experience and applied "tillering fertilizer" and "ear fertilizer" in a timely manner, obtaining a high yield of late rice. In order to achieve reasonable fertilization, the Menghu Second Team, led by team leader Ling Yunu, also organized three old farmers to form a fertilization research team, checking rice seedlings block by block, so as to achieve reasonable and skillful application based on "five observations": observing seedlings, observing weather, observing varieties, observing soil quality, and observing fertilizer manure.

Reasonable irrigation and timely drying of the field also have a great relationship with reducing the empty grain rate. When the Menghu Second Team harvested continuous cropping late rice in 1958, they found three fields with more than nine mu of the same soil quality, fertilization, dense planting, variety, cultivation management and other conditions in the Jinjiamentian polder, but the yields varied, showing three different situations: the yield of one mu and six fen of high-lying fields was low, and the yield of one mu and seven fen of low-lying fields was not high, and the yield of six mu of fields that were neither high nor low was the highest. After block-by-block analysis, the commune members found the reason. It turned out that the height of these three fields was different, and the degree of drying and baking the fields was also different. The field with the highest yield had smooth drainage, and because of frequent and shallow irrigation, the rice seedlings grew early, so it headed three days earlier than the other two fields, with uniform heading, tough rice stalks, no lodging, and a low empty grain rate; in addition, the high-lying fields were over-dried and lacked moisture, the heading was delayed, and the grains were not full, increasing the empty grains; while the low-lying fields were not dried or baked, and the fertilizer decomposed and absorbed slowly in the early stage, causing late development and delayed heading, early lodging, many empty grains, and low yields. From these fields, the commune members realized the role of shallow irrigation, frequent irrigation, and drying the field in reducing the empty grain rate.

Last year, during the period of drying and baking the continuous cropping late rice fields, they encountered long-term rainfall. The commune members drained the low-lying fields to ensure timely field drying, so they headed three days earlier than other teams, improving the grain filling rate.

This year, the commune members analyzed the characteristics of low temperature and rain since late July and decided to greatly strengthen field management, apply fertilizer early, promote early growth, and make the heading and flowering period ahead of the low temperature period. By August 14, the team had universally applied topdressing to 133 mu of continuous cropping late rice, and at the same time completed the first weeding and weeding, and treated insects twice. According to the recent rainy conditions, in order to achieve shallow irrigation and frequent drying, the first light drying has been started after the first weeding to increase the soil temperature, circulate soil air, accelerate the absorption of fertilizer by rice seedlings, and promote early growth. Due to proper management, the team's rice seedlings have entered a period of vigorous growth. (Attached picture)

    减少秕谷　争取晚稻粒粒结实
    孟湖二小队降低晚稻秕谷率的主要经验是：培育粗壮分蘖秧，选用
    穗大粒饱种，早插密植底肥足，施肥五看破早发，勤灌浅灌巧烤田
    编者按　长江流域各省是我国晚稻主要产区之一。由于气候和栽培技术的影响，这里的晚稻往往有一定比重的稻谷不能结实。因此，采取措施降低秕谷率，就成为长江流域晚稻产区普遍值得注意的问题。本报今天发表的孟湖二小队降低秕谷率的消息，对研究和解决这个问题提供了有益的经验，供大家参考。
    本报杭州29日电　降低连作晚稻秕谷率，是实现晚稻超早稻的重要一环。浙江海宁县许村公社永福生产队孟湖二小队在这方面积累了一套成功经验。现在他们正在抓紧田间管理，促使早发早熟，为进一步降低秕谷率，争取收获更多的晚稻创造条件。
    孟湖二小队自1956年开始种植连作晚稻以来，面积年年扩大，产量年年提高，连续四年实现了晚稻超早稻。他们初步掌握了降低秕谷率的经验，主要是：“培育粗壮分蘖秧，选用穗大粒饱高产种，早插密植底肥足，深耕精管高质量，施肥五看破早发，勤灌浅灌巧烤田，早耘精耘除净草，防病治虫免受害。”去年，这个小队实地调查了有代表性的十六块田三十三亩连作晚稻，秕谷率已降低到6.34％，比全生产队的平均秕谷率9.3％低50％左右，比全县平均秕谷率低60％左右。由于秕谷率的降低，每亩能增产稻谷五十多斤。
    1956年开始种植连作晚稻时，没有认识到连作晚稻因生长期比单季晚稻短，必须早施肥、早管理，促使早发育的生长规律，而是用栽培单季晚稻的办法来管理连作晚稻，因此，稻苗迟发，后期徒长，抽穗延迟，返青倒伏，有十八亩二分连作晚稻秕谷率高达25％以上。可是，也有二亩三分没有倒伏，穗大粒多，谷粒饱满，秕谷率只有8％，每亩产量多收一百余斤。这是什么原因呢？社员们回忆一番，原来这块田在插秧时每亩施了二十担羊棚灰作底肥，同时这块田由于迟插，秧苗有多余，每亩插了二十五万苗，在追肥时看到稻长得好，每亩又施了二十担“蚕蛹水”。由于有底肥，早施追肥，发棵快，长得好，没有倒伏；由于“蚕蛹水”有油，又抑制了稻飞虱的为害，从而获得了高产。社员们从这块田里吸取了经验，1957年，在四十八亩连作晚稻插秧时每亩都施了二十担多基肥。但是，这个时候他们还没有全面地掌握连作晚稻的生长规律，片面地接受了1956年倒伏的教训，采取少施或不施追肥的办法，只在三亩一分干部试验田中先后施上了发棵肥和长穗肥。结果施追肥的干部试验田每亩收了五百斤，不施追肥的四十五亩虽然没有倒伏，秕谷率有所降低，但亩产量只有四百二十斤，比干部试验田少收八十斤。从这一事实中，社员们又得到了经验。他们说：“暑前发足，秋前长谷，最后迟发，只抽不结。”说明连作晚稻必须提早管理、施肥，促使早发。“处暑”前发足发好，“秋分”前抽穗，长谷率就高；如果放松前期管理，造成“处暑”后迟发，“秋分”后抽穗，就要受早期低温侵袭，只抽穗而不结实，或秕谷率大大增高。去年，这个小队就根据这个经验，适时追了“发棵肥”、“长穗肥”，获得晚稻高产。为了做到合理施肥，孟湖二小队还以小队长凌羽囡为首，组织三个老农，成立了施肥研究小组，逐块检查稻苗，做到看苗、看天气、看品种、看土质、看肥粪“五看”合理巧施。
    合理灌溉，适时搁田，对降低秕谷率也有很大的关系。孟湖二小队在1958年收割连作晚稻时，发现金家门前圩内有九亩多土质、施肥、密植、品种、培育管理等各种条件相同的三块田，而产量高低不一，出现了三种不同情况：田脚高的一亩六分产量低，田脚低的一亩七分产量也不高，田脚不高不低的六亩产量最高。社员们经过逐块分析，找到了原因。原来这三块田的田脚高低不同，搁田、烤田的程度也不同。产量最高的这块田排水畅通，由于勤灌浅灌，稻苗早发，因此比其他两块田提早三天抽穗，抽穗整齐，稻秆坚韧，不倒伏，秕谷率低；另外田脚高的田因烤田过度，水分不足，抽穗延迟，谷粒不饱满，秕谷增加；而田脚低的田没有搁田、烤田，肥料前期分解吸收慢，造成迟发，延迟抽穗，早期倒伏，秕谷多，产量低。社员们从这几丘田当中认识到浅灌勤灌、搁田烤田对降低秕谷率的作用。
    去年连作晚稻搁田烤田期中遇到了长期下雨，社员们就将田脚低的田开沟排水，保证了适时烤田，因此比其他小队提早三天齐穗，提高了结实率。
    今年，社员们分析了7月下旬以来低温多雨的特点，决心大大加强田间管理，提早施肥，促使早发，使抽穗开花期赶在低温期的前头。到8月14日，全队一百三十三亩连作晚稻已普遍施了追肥，同时结束了头遍耘田除草，治虫两次。根据近一个时期多雨的情况，为了做到浅灌勤搁，在头次耘田后已开始第一次轻搁，以提高土温，流通土壤空气，使稻苗加速吸收肥料，促使早发。由于管理的恰当，全队稻苗已进入旺发期。（附图片）
