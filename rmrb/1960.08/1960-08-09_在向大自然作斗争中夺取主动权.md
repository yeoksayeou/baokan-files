    In recent years, the Chinese people have achieved particularly great victories in their struggle against nature. Many regions have suffered successive years of drought, flooding, and other natural disasters, but the annual output of agricultural products in these regions is still higher than the average annual output of the First Five-Year Plan; regions with better natural conditions have achieved even greater harvests. How was this achieved? The most important reason is that the broad masses and cadres at all levels across the country have made great achievements in studying Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic thinking has become a huge material force in the struggle between man and nature. In difficult situations, people have not been intimidated by difficulties, but have instead been full of fighting spirit, using all favorable factors to overcome unfavorable factors, and devising more methods to strive for increased production and guaranteed harvests in all kinds of situations. When the situation is relatively smooth or the struggle against disaster has achieved initial victories, people have not been intoxicated by victory, but have continued to struggle conscientiously, on the one hand using favorable conditions to strive for greater victories, and on the other hand preparing for new difficulties. With preparations to cope with various situations with ease, we can ensure victory even in unfavorable situations, and achieve even greater victories in favorable situations.
    On July 12, this newspaper published the news that rural areas in Shaanxi Province had established three lines of defense in current production, prepared two sets of gongs and drums, and were striving for a bumper autumn harvest under drought conditions. Today, we are publishing news that the agricultural front in Yunnan Province has deployed three lines of defense, resolutely planting more and harvesting more, and resolutely achieving high yields and more harvests. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee has also notified all parts of the province to study and promote the disaster resistance experience of the Luoshui River People's Commune in Lingqiu County: "Understand the laws, study countermeasures, put prevention first, and make two sets of arrangements" (this newspaper introduced this experience on July 8). These practices in Shaanxi, Yunnan, and Shanxi are examples of using Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic thinking to guide the production struggle. People in battle must strive for initiative and avoid being passive. Comrade Mao Zedong has always instructed us on the methods to gain the initiative: strive to grasp the laws of the development and changes of things, and give full play to people's conscious dynamic role; think of the worst and strive for the best; despise the enemy strategically and value the enemy tactically; concentrate superior forces to fight annihilation battles, and seize fortresses one after another.
    Comrade Mao Zedong has pointed out many times in his works that in order to win the victory of revolutionary struggle and production struggle, it is necessary to do a good job in investigation and research, grasp the laws of the changes of things, and then put forward plans, guidelines, policies, strategies, and tactics, and develop people's conscious dynamic role. Under the current conditions, fighting against nature, like fighting a war, has many phenomena that are more difficult to grasp than phenomena in other aspects, and are more associated with so-called "chance." However, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "War is not a divine thing, but still a necessary movement in the world, therefore, Sun Tzu's law, 'Know the enemy and know yourself, and you will not be defeated in a hundred battles,' is still a scientific truth. ... No matter what kind of war situation and war action, it is possible to know its general idea and its main points. First use various reconnaissance methods, and then use the commander's intelligent reasoning and judgment to reduce errors and achieve generally correct guidance. We can do it. With this 'generally correct guidance' as a weapon, we can win more battles, turn disadvantages into advantages, and turn passivity into initiative." ("On Protracted War") The changes in nature are not "divine things" either, but a necessary movement between heaven and earth, and therefore it is possible to grasp its laws to a certain extent. The power of the collective and the progress of science and technology have further increased the possibility of mastering these laws. The "three lines of defense" and "two sets of arrangements" in Shaanxi, Yunnan, Shanxi, and other places are all strategic deployments made after summarizing the experience of agricultural production and disaster resistance struggles in these areas for many years, analyzing the natural environment and the laws of crop growth, and studying the specific situation this year. Yunnan is dry and rainless before May every year, and many areas do not receive a drop of rain from the previous winter to May or June of the following year, making planting according to the seasons extremely difficult. On the other hand, years of production practice have proved that the drier the year, the higher the ground temperature, which is conducive to the growth of crops in this respect. If this favorable factor can be fully utilized, a dry year can be turned into a bumper year. The key is whether the crops can be planted before the rainy season. To plant before the rainy season, there must be water for irrigation. Due to the weak foundation in the past, after years of water conservancy construction since liberation, only 20 million mu of water-retaining fields have been built in Yunnan Province, and most other farmland cannot be irrigated. Therefore, it is necessary to plant these 20 million mu of irrigated fields before the rainy season, during the season when high ground temperature is most conducive to increased production, and ensure that they achieve high yields and more harvests, and strive for "one mu to top two mu." According to the water conservancy conditions in Yunnan Province, even if there is no rain before the planting season, it is still possible to ensure that these 20 million mu of fields are planted according to the season. This is a relatively reliable first line of defense and the main line of defense to ensure the completion of this year's production plan. At the same time, they are also actively preparing, and once the rain falls, they will rush to plant other farmland; if there is still a lack of rain at a certain season, they will plant drought-resistant crops in these fields in time. In short, we must strive to plant more and harvest more as much as possible. This is an indispensable second line of defense. These two lines of defense are the basic deployment for completing this year's agricultural production plan for the province. In addition, according to the characteristics of Yunnan's vast land and good climate conditions, when the basic planting of large areas is completed, we will fully tap the potential of the land and plant late autumn crops on a large scale. This is the third line of defense, which can become an important reserve for this year's agricultural production increase. Such a deployment is thorough and reasonable. This is the result of scientifically summarizing the characteristics of local agricultural production experience and natural conditions, and concretely analyzing various favorable and unfavorable factors.
    The experience of Shaanxi, Yunnan, Shanxi, and other places has universal national significance. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We must learn to look at problems comprehensively, not only to see the positive side of things, but also to see their negative side. Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") "Three lines of defense" and "two sets of arrangements" fully embody the spirit of seeing good things from bad things and turning bad things into good things, and seeing favorable factors and seizing favorable conditions in all kinds of difficult situations; at the same time, they also fully embody the spirit of preventing good things from turning into bad things and striving to make good things even better, and thinking of the worst and striving for the best even in relatively smooth situations. In the "three lines of defense," each line has "two sets of arrangements." Not only have meticulous plans been made to deal with the most unfavorable weather, but also necessary preparations have been made to utilize the most favorable weather. Not only have we grasped the measures for high yield on the land with the best conditions, but we have also taken care of the measures for guaranteeing production on the land with the worst conditions. Not only have we paid attention to planting more and harvesting more, but we have also paid attention to high yields and more harvests. Not only have we prepared to overcome one disaster and short-term disaster, but we have also prepared to overcome multiple disasters and long-term disasters. In this way, we can defend our positions and ensure the completion of the production plan even in the most unfavorable situations; and we can seize the opportunity and over fulfill the production plan in the most favorable situations. In this way, there is the greatest room for maneuver, and people's subjective dynamic role can be given the fullest play.
    The fundamental purpose of the "three lines of defense" and "two sets of arrangements" is to come up with more ways to increase the production of grain and industrial raw materials, and the fundamental spirit is to require people to exert full effort in any situation, to prepare to meet difficulties and expand their achievements when the situation is favorable, to bravely advance with full confidence even when the situation is unfavorable, and to never be complacent when the situation cannot be judged very clearly. Only by always exerting full effort, giving full play to people's subjective dynamic role under objectively permissible conditions, can we guarantee the construction of socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. What we mean by considering various possibilities is that we must not only think of the good things, but also think of the bad things, nor should we only make plans that are "neither too good nor too bad." Thinking of the worst is also to strive to turn bad things into good things. In each line of defense and each set of arrangements in Shaanxi, Yunnan, Shanxi, and other places, there are a series of solid defense and attack measures. We must not only grasp each line of defense firmly, but also actively prepare for the next line of defense. In concrete actions, we must not let go of any step and insist on every step, and strive for the complete victory of several lines of defense. From the best to the worst, there are preparations and methods. "If the East is not bright, the West is bright, if you lose here, you can find it there." People's vision and scope of activities are vast and broad, and they are more active and freer. On the one hand, we should believe that the changes of all things are regular, and all laws can be understood; in the struggle with nature, people are by no means powerless; the more fully people's effort is exerted, the more correctly they can understand and apply objective laws. On the other hand, we should understand that many things are intricate and complex, with many changes, and it is impossible to grasp their laws completely and correctly all at once; even if we understand the laws of some serious natural disasters, we cannot completely control them at present. The scope of the saying "The sky has unpredictable wind and clouds" is constantly shrinking; but it is still not a completely ineffective saying at present. To set up several lines of defense and make several sets of arrangements is precisely to be able to steadily grasp the initiative in the event of "measurable" changes, and to strive to steadily grasp the initiative in the event of "immeasurable" changes.
    In the struggle of agricultural production, it is undoubtedly very correct to take "man will conquer nature" as a strategic slogan. That is to say, we are not afraid of any natural disasters. From an overall point of view, man is the master of nature, and we can do everything possible to resist or reduce its threats and harms to crops. The disaster resistance struggles of millions of people in vast areas fully embody this conviction of victory and heroic spirit. However, in each battle, in each production activity, and on one specific issue after another, we must proceed from reality, concretely analyze various difficulties, distinguish different situations, and take practical and effective measures to concentrate superior forces to overcome one difficulty after another. This is what Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Our strategy is 'one against ten,' and our tactics are 'ten against one.' This is one of the fundamental principles for us to defeat the enemy." At present, the overall situation on the agricultural front is very good, and we have reason to be full of confidence in winning the victory on this year's agricultural front. At the same time, in every struggle to strive for and defend a bumper harvest in agriculture, we must carefully analyze the actual situation, properly arrange priorities, and concentrate our main forces to win the victory of one line of defense after another. Strategy and tactics are inseparable. We dare to despise difficulties, on the one hand because we have a correct understanding of the situation as a whole, and on the other hand because we have concrete measures sufficient to conquer difficulties on one specific issue after another, and can firmly take relatively accurate and effective measures. There are two sets of arrangements as guarantees on each line of defense, which can be advanced or defended, and there is defense in attack, and defense is also for the purpose of attack; in this way, we can firmly hold the initiative of the agricultural front in our hands.
    In order to continuously achieve greater victories in the struggle against nature, we must arm ourselves with more material on the one hand and arm ourselves with more theory on the other hand. "We acknowledge that in the general course of historical development it is material things that determine spiritual things, social existence that determines social consciousness; but at the same time we also acknowledge and must acknowledge the reaction of spiritual things, the reaction of social consciousness to social existence, the reaction of the superstructure to the economic base." ("On Contradiction") We have powerful people's communes, and socialist industry is providing more and more support to agriculture, and the conditions for fighting against nature are becoming more and more favorable. However, to ensure victory, we must add subjective efforts and be good at using objective conditions; we must not only have the courage to overcome nature, but also have the ability to control the development and changes of the entire struggle situation. Here, strengthening theoretical cultivation, improving working methods, and improving ideological level play a decisive role. We must study Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic thinking more and better, and apply it correctly and flexibly to the current practical struggle. This is an extremely important guarantee for achieving more and greater victories.

### 在向大自然作斗争中夺取主动权

    在向大自然作斗争中夺取主动权
    近几年来，我国人民在对大自然作斗争中取得了特别巨大的胜利。不少地区连年遭受旱涝和其他自然灾害的侵袭，但是，这些地区的农产品的年产量仍然高于第一个五年计划的平均年产量；自然条件比较好的地区，则获得了更大丰收。这是怎样获得的呢？最重要的原因就是全国各地广大群众和各级干部学习毛泽东思想已经有了很大成效。毛泽东同志的战略思想在人与自然的斗争中已经变成了巨大的物质力量。在困难的情况下，人们没有被困难吓倒，而是斗志昂扬地运用一切有利因素克服不利因素，想出更多办法在种种情况下争取增产保收。在情况比较顺利或抗灾斗争得到初步胜利的情况下，人们没有在胜利中陶醉，而是兢兢业业地继续斗争，一方面运用有利条件争取更大胜利，一方面防备发生新的困难。有了在各种不同情况下都能应付裕如的准备，就能够确保在不利的情况下也得到胜利，在有利的情况下就得到更大的胜利。
    7月12日，本报发表了陕西省农村在当前生产中建立三道防线，准备两套锣鼓，在干旱条件下争取秋季丰收的消息。今天，又发表了云南省农业战线上部署三道防线，坚决多种多收，坚决高产多收的消息。山西省委也已经通知全省各地学习和推广灵丘县落水河人民公社“摸清规律，研究对策，防字当先，两套安排”的抗灾经验（本报7月8日介绍了这个经验）。陕西、云南、山西的这些做法，正是运用毛泽东同志的战略思想指导生产斗争的几个范例。人们在战斗中都要力争主动，力避被动。毛泽东同志历来指示我们争得主动权的方法，就是：力求掌握事物发展变化的规律，充分发挥人的自觉的能动性；要从最坏处着想，向最好处努力；要在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人；要集中优势力量打歼灭战，一个又一个地夺取堡垒。
    毛泽东同志在他的著作中多次指出，要取得革命斗争和生产斗争的胜利，必须做好调查研究工作，掌握事物变化的规律，然后提出计划、方针、政策、战略、战术，发扬人的自觉的能动性。在目前条件下，同大自然作斗争，像打仗一样，有许多现象比别的方面的现象更难捉摸，更带所谓“偶然性”。但是，正如毛泽东同志说的，“战争不是神物，仍是世间的一种必然运动，因此，孙子的规律，‘知彼知己，百战不殆’，仍是科学的真理。……不管怎样的战争情况和战争行动，知其大略，知其要点，是可能的。先之以各种侦察手段，继之以指挥员的聪明的推论和判断，减少错误，实现一般的正确指导，是做得到的。我们有了这个‘一般地正确的指导’做武器，就能多打胜仗，就能变劣势为优势，变被动为主动。”（《论持久战》）大自然的变化也不是什么“神物”，而是天地间的一种必然运动，因此，也就能够在一定程度上掌握它的规律。集体力量的强大和科学技术的进步，更使掌握这些规律增大了可能性。陕西、云南、山西等地的“三道防线”“两套安排”，都是总结了当地多年来农业生产和抗灾斗争的经验，分析了当地自然环境的情况和作物生长的规律，研究了今年的具体情况，而后采取的战略部署。云南每年5月以前天旱不雨，不少地区从前一年冬季到第二年5、6月这段时间滴雨不下，按节令栽种有严重困难。另一方面，历年的生产实践证明了，越是干旱的年头，地温越高，就这一点说则有利于农作物的成长。如能充分运用这个有利因素，就能变干旱年为丰收年。关键在于能不能抢在雨季前把作物栽种下去。要在雨季前栽种，就必须有水灌溉。由于过去基础薄弱，经过解放后连年兴修水利，云南全省的保水田还只有二千万亩，其他大部分农田还不可能有水灌溉。因此，必须在雨季前地温高最有利于增产的节令内栽完这批有水灌溉的二千万亩田，保证它们确实高产多收，力争“一亩顶两亩”。根据云南省的水利条件，即使在栽插节令前滴雨不下，仍能保证这两千万亩田按节令栽种，这是比较有把握的第一道防线，也是保证完成今年生产计划的主要防线。同时，他们又积极做好准备，一旦雨水落地，就突击抢栽其他农田；如果到了一定季节仍然缺雨，就要及时在这些田里种上耐旱作物。总之，要尽可能争取多种多收。这是不可忽视的第二道防线。这两道防线是完成全省今年农业生产计划的基本部署。此外，又根据云南土地广阔、气候条件好的特点，在大面积栽种基本结束时，充分挖掘土地潜力，大种晚秋作物。这就是第三道防线，可以成为今年农业增产的重要后备。这样的部署是周密的合理的。这正是科学地概括了当地农业生产经验和自然条件的特点，具体地分析了各种有利和不利因素的结果。
    陕西、云南、山西等地的经验，有普遍的全国的意义。毛泽东同志说：“我们必须学会全面地看问题，不但要看到事物的正面，也要看到它的反面。在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果。”（《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》）“三道防线”，“两套安排”，充分体现了从坏事中看出好事和变坏事为好事的精神，在种种困难情况下都能看到有利因素，都能抓住有利条件；同时，又充分体现了预防好事变成坏事和力求使好事变成更好的事的精神，在比较顺利的情况下也向最坏处着想，向更好处努力。在“三道防线”中，每一道都有“两套安排”。既为对付最不利的天时作了周密的打算，也为利用最有利的天时作了必要的准备。既抓紧了条件最好的土地上的丰产措施，也照顾到条件最差的土地上的保产措施。既注意了多种多收，又注意了高产多收。既准备了战胜一种灾害、短期灾害，又准备了战胜多种灾害、长期灾害。这样，在最不利的情况下也能固守阵地，确保完成生产计划；在最有利的情况下又能不失时机，超额完成生产计划。这样，就有了最大的回旋余地，也就能最充分地发挥人的主观能动作用。
    “三道防线”，“两套安排”，根本目的都在于想出更多办法增产粮食和工业原料，根本精神都是要求人们在任何情况下都鼓足干劲，在情况有利的时候准备迎击困难和扩大战果，在情况不利的时候也信心百倍地奋勇前进，在情况不能判断得十分清楚的时候决不心存侥幸。只有永远地鼓足干劲，在客观许可的条件下，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，才是多快好省地建设社会主义的根本保证。我们说的设想多种可能，是说既不能尽往好处想，又不能尽往坏处想，也不能只作“不太好也不太坏”的打算。向最坏处着想，也是为了力求把坏事变成好事。在陕西、云南、山西等地的每一道防线、每一套安排中，都包含着一系列扎扎实实的防守和进攻的措施。既要狠抓每一道防线，又要积极准备下一道防线。在具体行动当中要一步不放、步步坚持，争取几道防线的全胜。上至最好，下至最坏，都有准备，都有办法，“东方不亮西方亮，这里丢了那里找”，人们的视野和活动的范围海阔天空了，就比较主动、比较自由了。一方面，我们应当相信，一切事物的变化都是有规律的，一切规律都是能够认识的；在和自然斗争中，人决不是无能为力的；人的干劲鼓得越足，越能正确地认识和运用客观规律。另方面，我们应当了解，许多事物错综复杂、变化多端，不可能一下子就全部正确无误地掌握住它们的规律；对于有的严重的自然灾害，即使了解了它的活动规律，目前也还不能完全控制住它。“天有不测风云”这句话起作用的范围正在不断缩小；但是它在目前还不是一句完全不起作用的话。要设几道防线，要作几套安排，正是为了在发生“可测”的变化的情况下能稳操主动权，在发生“不测”的变化的情况下也能力争稳操主动权。
    在农业生产斗争中，把“人定胜天”作为战略口号，无疑是十分正确的。这就是说，我们不怕任何自然灾害，从整体上看，人是大自然的主人，我们能够尽一切人力的可能去抵制或减轻它对农作物的威胁和危害。广大地区千百万群众的抗灾斗争，充分体现了这种必胜信念和英雄气概。但是在每个战役当中，在每项生产活动当中，在一个一个的具体问题上，我们必须从实际出发，具体地分析各种困难，区别不同情况，采取切实有效的措施，集中优势力量克服一个又一个的困难。也就是毛泽东同志所教导我们的：“我们的战略是‘以一当十’，我们的战术是‘以十当一’，这是我们制胜敌人的根本法则之一。”当前，农业战线上总的形势是很好的，我们有理由充满信心地夺取今年农业战线上的胜利。同时，在争取和保卫农业丰收的每一场斗争中，都要认真分析实际情况，妥善安排轻重缓急，集中主要力量夺取一道防线又一道防线的胜利。战略和战术是不可分割的。我们敢于藐视困难，一方面是由于在整体上对形势有正确的认识，又一方面是由于在一个一个具体问题上有足以征服困难的具体措施，而且能够坚定不移地采取比较准确有力的措施。在每一道防线上都有两套安排作保证，进可以攻，退可以守，攻中有守，守也是为了攻；这样，就能把农业战线的主动权紧紧握在我们手中。
    在同大自然作斗争中要不断地取得更大的胜利，必须一方面用更多的物质武装起来，一方面用更多的理论武装起来。“我们承认总的历史发展中是物质的东西决定精神的东西，是社会的存在决定社会的意识；但是同时又承认而且必须承认精神的东西的反作用，社会意识对于社会存在的反作用，上层建筑对于经济基础的反作用。”（《矛盾论》）我们有了强大的人民公社，又有社会主义工业对农业的越来越多的支援，同大自然作斗争的条件越来越有利。可是，要确保取得胜利，还须加上主观的努力，还须善于运用客观的条件；不但要有战胜大自然的勇气，而且要有驾驭整个斗争形势发展变化的能力。在这里，加强理论修养、改进工作方法、提高思想水平就有了决定的作用。我们一定要更多更好地学习毛泽东同志的战略思想，并且把它正确地灵活地运用到当前的实际斗争中去。这是取得更多更大的胜利的极其重要的保证。
