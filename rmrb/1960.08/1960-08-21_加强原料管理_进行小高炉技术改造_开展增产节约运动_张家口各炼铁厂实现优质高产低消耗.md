Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 20th: The Zhangjiakou area of ​​Hebei Province has achieved remarkable results in launching a production increase and thrift campaign in its iron and steel plants. From August 1st to 15th, the average utilization coefficient of 56 small blast furnaces in the area reached 1.36, an increase of 10.3% compared with the second half of July; the qualified rate of pig iron reached 89.23%, an increase of more than 6% compared with the second half of July; the average coke consumption per ton of iron was more than 100 kilograms less than in the second half of July, achieving high output, high quality, and low consumption, a comprehensive leap forward.

In the production increase and thrift campaign, the Zhangjiakou City iron and steel plants mainly focused on two key links: one is the raw material supply and management for small blast furnaces; the other is the technical transformation of small blast furnaces. At the beginning of August, the iron and steel plants in the city mobilized workers to analyze and study the current production situation furnace by furnace, workshop by workshop, and work section by work section. The analysis results of each factory showed that the consumption of ironmaking raw materials accounted for more than 50% of the cost of pig iron. The supply conditions and management of raw materials are also another important condition determining the output and quality of pig iron in small blast furnaces. In response to this situation, each factory regarded strengthening raw material management and changing raw material supply conditions as the key to comprehensively improving the output of pig iron from small blast furnaces and saving resources, mobilizing the masses to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale, and doing everything possible to reform raw material management and supply work to improve ore grade, allowing small blast furnaces to "eat fine grains and cooked materials." Zhangjiabao Iron and Steel Plant had inconvenient transportation, and the coke supply was not timely, which affected the improvement of pig iron output and quality. Based on the experience of using lump coal to make iron created by Jiajiaying Iron and Steel Plant, the workers used locally produced lump coal to make iron after many experiments, ensuring a timely supply of coke, which significantly increased the output of small blast furnaces. The qualified rate of pig iron increased from more than 70% in the past to 100% now, and all are first-class products; the coke ratio dropped below 0.99 tons, and the cost per ton of iron also dropped below 170 yuan. Now, all iron and steel plants in the city have generally promoted the advanced experience of Zhangjiabao, Jiajiaying and other iron and steel plants in using lump coal to make iron and using white coal to make coke, greatly changing the supply situation of coking coal in iron and steel plants throughout the area and ensuring the continuous leap forward in the production of small blast furnaces. In terms of strengthening raw material management, each factory has established a complete set of management systems from raw material warehousing, crushing, washing, beneficiation, and roasting. Most iron and steel plants cooperated with mines to select materials on the spot; in terms of raw material management in the factory, they achieved raw material measurement upon entering the factory, batch-by-batch testing, hierarchical management, fine selection and processing, material determination by furnace, and roasting before entering the furnace, allowing small blast furnaces to eat fine and cooked materials. At present, the iron content of ore entering the furnace in the city has increased from about 45% in the past to more than 50%.

In accelerating the technical transformation of small blast furnaces, all factories in the city have taken a series of new measures to ensure that one furnace is transformed and one furnace is consolidated. The city has transformed the Zhangjiakou No. 2 Machinery Manufacturing Plant into a metallurgical machinery and equipment manufacturing plant, specializing in manufacturing various equipment needed for the transformation of small blast furnaces; at the same time, it has also organized prospecting machinery plants, coal mining machinery plants, etc. to cooperate with each other to concentrate on manufacturing various mechanical equipment needed for the technical transformation of small blast furnaces; various factories and mining enterprises have also provided more than 1,000 tons of equipment and materials for the transformation of small blast furnaces. The construction departments have transferred more than 600 furnace builders and electromechanical installation workers to form a professional team for the transformation of small blast furnaces, adopting methods of fixing furnaces, fixing personnel, fixing time, and contracting by branch factories to accelerate the progress of the technical transformation of small blast furnaces. In order to consolidate the results of the transformation of small blast furnaces, each iron and steel plant has also strengthened its equipment maintenance force to ensure the normal production of small blast furnaces. At present, two-thirds of the blast furnaces in the city have been transformed. After the transformation, the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces has increased by 50% to 100% compared with the original, the qualified rate of pig iron has reached more than 90%, and the coke ratio has dropped from 1.3 tons in the past to about 1 ton.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the production increase and thrift campaign, the Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China transferred more than 40 cadres from various industrial departments in the city at the beginning of August, with the industrial secretary personally taking charge, and went deep into each iron and steel plant to summarize experience together with the leading cadres of each iron and steel plant, strengthen the weak links in production, and promote the development of the production increase and thrift campaign. The Party Secretary and Director of Jiajiaying Iron and Steel Plant adopted methods such as assigning packages for each furnace and planting experimental fields to systematically summarize the new experiences of technical innovation and technical revolution, and formulated a complete set of small blast furnace operation methods, so that the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the first half of August increased by 6.48% compared with the second half of August, the qualified rate of pig iron reached more than 99%, and the coke ratio dropped below 1.13 tons.

    加强原料管理　进行小高炉技术改造　开展增产节约运动
    张家口各炼铁厂实现优质高产低消耗
    据新华社天津20日电　河北省张家口地区各炼铁厂开展增产节约运动，已经取得了显著成绩。8月1日到15日，全区五十六座小高炉，平均利用系数达到了一点三六，比7月下半月提高了10.3％；生铁合格率达到89.23％，比7月下半月提高6％以上；平均每吨铁比7月下半月少用焦炭一百多公斤，作到了高产、优质、低消耗，全面跃进。
    张家口市各炼铁厂在增产节约运动中，主要抓住了两个环节：一是小高炉的原料供应和管理工作；二是小高炉的技术改造。8月初这个市各炼铁厂就发动职工逐炉、逐车间、逐工段地分析研究了当前生产情况。各厂分析的结果，炼铁原料的消耗都占生铁成本的50％以上。原料的供应条件和管理工作，也是决定小高炉生铁产量和质量的另一重要条件。针对这一情况，各厂都把加强原料管理、改变原料供应条件作为全面提高小高炉生铁产量和节约的关键，发动群众大搞技术革新和技术革命，千方百计地改革原料管理和供应工作，提高矿石品位，让小高炉“吃细粮、吃熟料”。张家堡炼铁厂交通不便，焦炭供应不及时，影响生铁产量和质量的提高。职工们就根据贾家营炼铁厂创造的块煤炼铁的经验，经过多次试验，用本地生产的块煤炼铁，保证了焦炭及时的供应，使小高炉的产量显著提高，生铁的合格率由过去的70％多提高到了现在的100％，而且全部是一级品；焦比降到零点九九吨以下，每吨铁成本也降到一百七十元以下。现在，全市各炼铁厂已普遍推广了张家堡、贾家营等炼铁厂块煤炼铁、白煤炼焦等先进经验，大大改变了全区各炼铁厂焦煤的供应情况，保证了小高炉生产持续跃进。在加强原料管理方面，各厂都建立了从原料入库、破碎、洗选、焙烧等一整套管理制度。大部分炼铁厂作到了与矿山协作，就地选料；在厂的原料管理方面，做到了原料进厂计量，批批化验，分级管理，精选加工，以炉定料，焙烧入炉，让小高炉吃精料、熟料。目前，全市入炉矿石的含铁量由过去的45％左右，提高到50％以上。
    在加速小高炉的技术改造方面，全市各厂都采取了一系列新的措施，作到了改造一座，巩固一座。这个市已把张家口第二机械制造厂改为冶金机械设备制造厂，专门制造小高炉改造所需要的各种设备；同时还组织探矿机械厂、煤矿机械厂等，互相协作，突击制造小高炉技术改造所需要的各种机械设备；各厂矿企业还拿出一千多吨器材供应小高炉改造所需要的器材。各建筑部门抽调了六百多名砌炉、机电安装工人，组成小高炉改造专业队，采取定炉、定员、定时间、分厂包干的办法，来加快小高炉技术改造的进度。为了巩固小高炉改造的成果，各炼铁厂还加强了设备维修力量，保证了小高炉正常生产。目前，全市已有三分之二的高炉进行了改造。经过改造的小高炉，利用系数都比原来提高了50％到一倍，生铁合格率达到90％以上，焦比由过去的一点三吨降低到一吨左右。
    为了加强对增产节约运动的领导，中共张家口市委在8月初从全市各工业部门抽调出四十多名干部，由工业书记亲自挂帅，深入到各炼铁厂，同各炼铁厂领导干部一起总结经验，加强生产中的薄弱环节，促进了增产节约运动的开展。贾家营炼铁厂党委书记、厂长采取分片包炉、种试验田等方法，系统地总结技术革新和技术革命的新经验，制订出一整套小高炉操作方法，使8月上半月全厂小高炉平均利用系数比8月下半月提高6.48％，生铁合格率达到99％以上，焦比降到一点一三吨以下。
