Xinhua News Agency, August 29th, San José dispatch: The people of San José, the capital of Costa Rica and the meeting place for this Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' Meeting, broke through the strict precautions taken by the authorities and continued to carry out a movement to support Cuba and oppose US interference.

Today, university students continued to release balloons tied with large Cuban flags and slogans demanding respect for Cuban sovereignty. Last night, the Association of Friends of the Cuban Revolution held a mass rally in support of Cuba, at which the masses awarded a gold medal to Cuban Foreign Minister Roa. A mass rally in support of Cuba was also held in Golfito, located in the United Fruit Company's banana plantation area.

The vast majority of residents throughout Costa Rica listened with great interest on the radio to the speech of the Cuban Foreign Minister at the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' Meeting. According to statistics, more than 95% of the radios in San José listened to his speech.

Xinhua News Agency, August 29th, Bogotá dispatch: Juan de la Cruz Varela, a prominent Colombian peasant movement leader and secretary of the National Federation of Agricultural Workers, recently told reporters that the Cuban revolution is a great example for the people of Latin American countries and has won the support of the people of Latin American countries. Colombian farmers are also ready to assist their Cuban brothers at any moment. Varela made these remarks after returning home from a visit to Cuba.

Varela pointed out that the whole world knows that the US State Department and US monopoly groups are frantically preparing to carry out military intervention against Cuba. The arguments of "interference by countries outside the continent" and "communist infiltration" put forward in the Organization of American States serve the interests of the United States. He said that the Organization of American States is an organization manipulated by the US State Department. Six years ago, the United States used this organization to cover up its intervention in Guatemala. Varela emphasized that in order to stop the sinister attempt to repeat the events of Guatemala, the Cuban people have put forward the slogan "Defend the Motherland to the Death," and the entire Latin American people are launching a huge wave of support for the Cuban people, preparing to support the Cuban people in the most effective way.

Varela said that Cuba's land reform is proceeding along the road of eradicating feudal and semi-feudal systems. Varela also expressed support for the Cuban government's recent measures to confiscate American companies. He said that this step by the Cuban government is "not only necessary but also justified," because foreign capital had stifled Cuba's national economy and carried out cruel plunder of Cuba. He said, "The same should be done in Colombia, especially in natural resources such as oil, gold, silver, and platinum, which have been subjected to the insatiable plunder of American companies." He pointed out that the control of Colombian natural resources and foreign trade by US capital, as well as the economic measures imposed by the International Monetary Fund, are the reasons for Colombia's poverty.

Varela concluded by saying that the current huge wave of Latin American people supporting Cuba is "a powerful anti-imperialist movement that will make American intervention difficult." He said, "If the American aggressors dare to set foot on Cuban soil, the Latin American people will not only take up arms to support the Cuban revolution, but will also launch similar revolutionary movements in their own countries to bury American exploitation among us."

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, August 26th: People from all walks of life in Argentina continue to express their support for Cuba.

Ten members of parliament from the ruling party submitted a draft statement to the House of Representatives, requesting the parliament to make the government change Argentina's position at the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' Meeting. The draft statement believes that the Argentine delegation's attitude at the aforementioned meeting is not in line with the traditional policy of neutrality and respect for national sovereignty. The statement pointed out: "For us, Cuba is a sovereign state and it is not sitting in the dock."

The Argentine University Federation and several other youth organizations held a rally in support of Cuba on the 26th in the Argentine capital. Alfredo Valladares of the Argentine University Federation and a representative of the Secondary School Students Federation reiterated in their speeches at the meeting their determination to defend the Cuban revolution unconditionally. They said that any Latin American country that rises up against imperialism will receive the support of the people of all other Latin American countries. They declared that the people of Latin America can get rid of imperialism and achieve the true independence that their predecessors failed to fully achieve.

"La Razón" published a statement signed by nearly one hundred writers in support of the Cuban revolution.

According to "La Prensa," a large number of leaflets signed by "Cuban Young Friends" were distributed around the newspaper office. These leaflets read: "Don't let American criminals touch Cuba," "Down with this ugly farce of the Organization of American States."

Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, August 27th: The Venezuelan people continue to hold demonstrations and rallies in support of Cuba. In Venezuela, several cities have held marches in support of the Cuban revolution. On the 26th, university students in the capital Caracas held rallies in several places to support Cuba.

In Barquisimeto, marching women walked through the streets of the central district, distributing leaflets supporting the Cuban revolution along the way.

    反对美帝国主义利用美洲国家外长会议作侵略工具
    拉丁美洲人民高呼不准干涉古巴
    新华社29日讯　圣约瑟消息：作为这次美洲国家组织外长会议开会地点的哥斯达黎加首都圣约瑟的人民冲破了当局的严密戒备，继续开展声援古巴、反对美国干涉的运动。
    大学生们今天继续放送了系着大幅古巴国旗和要求尊重古巴主权标语的轻气球。昨天晚上，古巴革命之友协会召开了支持古巴的群众大会，在会上，群众把金质奖章授予古巴外交部长罗亚。位于美国联合果品公司香蕉种植区的戈耳菲托城，也举行了支持古巴的群众集会。
    哥斯达黎加全国广大居民都怀着巨大的兴趣从收音机里收听了古巴外交部长在美洲国家组织外长会议上的发言。据统计，圣约瑟95％以上的收音机都收听了他的讲话。
    新华社29日讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚著名农民运动领袖、全国农业工人联合会书记胡安·德拉克鲁斯·巴雷拉不久前对记者发表谈话说：古巴革命是拉丁美洲各国人民的一个伟大范例，它赢得了拉丁美洲各国人民的支持。哥伦比亚农民也已经准备好在任何时刻援助古巴的弟兄。巴雷拉是在访问古巴回国以后发表这次谈话的。
    巴雷拉指出，全世界都知道，美国国务院和美国垄断集团正在疯狂地准备对古巴实行军事干涉。在美洲国家组织提出的所谓“大陆以外的国家的干涉”和“共产主义渗入”的论点，都是为美国利益服务的。他说，美洲国家组织是一个由美国国务院操纵的机构，六年以前美国曾利用这个组织来掩盖它对危地马拉的干涉。巴雷拉强调说，为了制止重演危地马拉事件的罪恶企图，古巴人民已经提出了“誓死保卫祖国”的口号，整个拉丁美洲人民也正在掀起一个支持古巴人民的巨大浪潮，准备以最有效的方式支持古巴人民。
    巴雷拉说，古巴的土地改革是沿着铲除封建和半封建制度的道路进行的。巴雷拉还表示支持古巴政府最近没收美国公司的措施。他说，古巴政府这一步骤“不仅必需，而且是正当的”，因为外国资本曾经窒息了古巴的民族经济，对古巴进行了残酷的掠夺。他说，“在哥伦比亚也应该这样做，特别是在受到美国公司贪得无厌的掠夺的自然资源如石油、黄金、白银、白金等方面。”他指出，美国资本对哥伦比亚自然资源和对外贸易的控制以及国际货币基金组织强加的经济措施，是使哥伦比亚贫困的原因。
    巴雷拉最后说，目前拉丁美洲人民支持古巴的巨大浪潮，是“一个强大的反帝国主义的运动，这一运动将使美国的干涉难以进行。”他说，“如果美国侵略者胆敢把它的脚踏上古巴土地，拉丁美洲人民将不仅拿起武器来支持古巴革命，而且也将在自己的国家中展开类似的革命运动，把美国的剥削在我们当中埋葬掉。”
    据新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯26日电　阿根廷各界人士继续表示支持古巴。
    十个执政党议员向众议院提出了一项声明草案，要求议院使政府改变阿根廷在美洲国家组织外长会议上的立场。声明草案认为，阿根廷代表团在上述会议上的态度不符合中立政策和尊重国家主权的传统政策。声明指出：“对我们来说，古巴是一个主权国家，它并不是坐在被告席上”。
    阿根廷大学生联合会和另外几个青年组织26日在阿根廷首都举行了支持古巴的大会。阿根廷大学生联合会的阿尔弗雷多·巴利亚达雷斯和中学生联合会的一位代表在会上的讲话中重申他们无条件地保卫古巴革命的决心。他们说，任何起来反对帝国主义的拉丁美洲国家都将得到所有其他拉丁美洲国家人民的支持。他们宣称，拉丁美洲人民能够摆脱帝国主义，获得他们先辈所未能完全获得的真正的独立。
    “理性报”刊登了由将近一百位作家签署的支持古巴革命的声明。
    据“新闻报”报道，在这个报社的周围有人散发了大量的由“古巴的青年朋友”署名的传单，这些传单写着：“不准美国罪犯碰古巴”，“打倒美洲国家组织的这幕丑剧”。
    据新华社加拉加斯27日电　委内瑞拉人民继续举行支持古巴的示威游行和集会。在委内瑞拉，好几个城市都举行了支持古巴革命的游行。26日，首都加拉加斯的大学生在好几个地方举行了声援古巴的集会。
    在巴圭西美托城，游行的妇女群众穿过中心区的街道，沿途散发支持古巴革命的传单。
