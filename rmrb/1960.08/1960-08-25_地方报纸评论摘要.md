    Devote Major Efforts to Fertilizer Production to Support Agriculture
    -- Excerpt from Shanghai Liberation Daily
    The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China calls on the people of the city to immediately mobilize and launch a crash program of major fertilizer production to support agricultural production. This is a powerful measure and important task for the city to support the countryside.
    The rural areas in the suburbs are in urgent need of fertilizer, and the city has abundant sources of fertilizer. In the past, although the fertilizer departments organized specialized forces to collect and transport fertilizer to the countryside regularly, because the fertilizer accumulation work was not made a mass movement, some fertilizer, such as manure, was lost, and many miscellaneous fertilizers regarded as treasures in the countryside were not well collected and fully utilized. In order to fully tap the city's rich sources of fertilizer and make them play a role in agricultural production, it is necessary to launch a mass movement of major fertilizer production in the city. Moreover, carrying out a mass movement of major fertilizer production can be closely combined with the patriotic health campaign. Regularly, widely, and deeply carrying out the patriotic health campaign can not only improve the city's environmental sanitation, but also collect more fertilizer for the countryside, killing two birds with one stone.
    In order to transport the accumulated large amount of fertilizer to the countryside in a timely manner, it is necessary to earnestly solve the problem of transportation. We must do everything possible to tap the transportation potential and organize the transportation work more rationally. We should make full use of the water and land transportation tools that travel between urban and rural areas as much as possible, and avoid empty vehicles and empty boats. The city should take the initiative to "send", and the countryside should also take the initiative to do a good job in "receiving". "Sending" and "receiving" should be closely connected. This requires the relevant departments in urban and rural areas to properly organize and arrange to avoid disconnection and waste in transportation.
    The city's major fertilizer production is a mass movement to support the countryside. All relevant departments should widely publicize to the masses the important significance of major fertilizer production and supporting agriculture, explaining that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. The whole party and the whole people should work together to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. In order to increase grain production, we must accumulate more fertilizer; with more grain, the development of industrial and agricultural production will have a more reliable guarantee. Through this publicity and mobilization work, the people of the city should further establish the idea of "taking agriculture as the foundation", establish a sense of honor and responsibility in supporting agriculture, on the one hand, consciously participate in this crash program of major fertilizer production, and on the other hand, develop the habit of accumulating and collecting fertilizer for the countryside, so that urban fertilizer accumulation can also be regularized, in order to vigorously support the continuous leap forward in suburban agricultural production.

    Prepare Sufficient Fertilizer for Wheat Planting
    -- Excerpt from Hebei Daily
    At present, various places are carrying out comprehensive preparations for planting more and better wheat. Fertilizer is the "grain" of crops. To win a bumper wheat harvest next year, we must prepare enough fertilizer. Wheat is a famous "rich from the womb" crop, and its roots are very fertilizer-seeking. Applying more base fertilizer can make wheat roots develop better and lay the foundation for "lush leaves". Especially this year, the wheat planting area in our province will be greatly increased compared with last year, and the management level requirements are much higher than in previous years. Whether or not we can achieve high standards and high yields in wheat management, one of the decisive keys lies in whether we can accumulate more fertilizer. At the same time, in order to ensure the increased production of spring-sown crops next year, we also need to prepare some high-quality fertilizer now.
    To prepare sufficient fertilizer, we must earnestly implement the policies and further mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses in accumulating fertilizer. We must grasp both collective fertilizer accumulation and individual fertilizer accumulation by commune members. In terms of collective fertilizer accumulation, in addition to helping pig farms, sheepfolds, livestock sheds, fertilizer plants, and specialized fertilizer accumulation teams to continuously improve fertilizer accumulation methods, increase the amount of fertilizer accumulated, and improve the quality of fertilizer accumulated, we should also prominently promote the quota responsibility system for fertilizer accumulation. In grasping individual fertilizer accumulation by commune members, we should conscientiously implement the policy of rewarding fertilizer accumulation, achieve quality-based pricing, and cash in the fertilizer price. For commune members who accumulate a lot of fertilizer and have good quality, they should be rewarded and set up as banners, so that large-scale fertilizer accumulation and production becomes a social trend.
    To prepare more fertilizer for wheat early, we must start early and arrange early. In the past, some areas started accumulating fertilizer late, and only made temporary crash efforts when fertilizer was needed, forming "accumulating in the year and applying in the month", which could not use the fertilizer effect on the "blade". To change this passive situation and fight an active battle in fertilizer accumulation, we must comprehensively plan the accumulation, transportation, and use of fertilizer, so that fertilizer accumulation, like other production, is included in the production plan, and start immediately from now on.
    From now to the sowing of wheat, there is only about a month left. All localities must seize this good opportunity and combine field management to vigorously grasp fertilizer.

    Vigorously Grasp Fertilizer Accumulation and Production
    -- Excerpt from Inner Mongolia Daily
    In order to produce more grain, we must fundamentally solve the fertilizer problem. The turn of summer and autumn is a great season for a crash program of fertilizer accumulation, and it is also a favorable time for us to establish fertilizer bases. Party committees at all levels must vigorously grasp fertilizer, carry out a vigorous and down-to-earth movement of fertilizer accumulation and production, solve the current need for topdressing of crops, and at the same time prepare a considerable portion of base fertilizer for spring sowing next year, and build fertilizer bases in a planned and step-by-step manner, so as to establish fertilizer accumulation and production work on a solid and reliable foundation.
    First of all, we must vigorously grasp the construction of fertilizer bases, which is the key to fundamentally solving the fertilizer problem. When establishing fertilizer bases, we must not only consider how to enable the fertilizer bases to continuously provide a large amount of high-quality fertilizer, but also, based on the characteristics of our region's large land and small population and long fertilizer transportation distances, we must also solve the problem of saving labor and animal power for fertilizer accumulation and transportation. In our region's rural areas, the farm work that consumes the most labor and animal power every year is fertilizer accumulation and manure delivery. Implementing the method of animal pens to the fields will greatly alleviate the tension of labor and animal power. The second is to establish green manure bases. The masses in the Yinshan hilly area of our region have the habit of green manure application, and the effect of increasing production is also very significant. The masses often use the saying "You have a wheat cellar, I have green manure land" to evaluate the role of green manure application. We should regard the promotion of green manure application as a work of building green manure bases, and all localities should try to turn over as much arable land that cannot be sown in the current year as possible for green manure application every year. Third, is to establish chemical fertilizer bases. Since the Great Leap Forward, people's communes have vigorously run indigenous chemical fertilizer plants, which have prepared conditions for the establishment of chemical fertilizer bases. Now, we must further consolidate and improve these commune-run factories, and select those with good conditions to expand the scale of production, and strive to produce more indigenous chemical fertilizer as soon as possible to supply production needs.

    地方报纸评论摘要
    大搞肥料支援农业
    ——摘自上海解放日报
    中共上海市委号召全市人民立即动员起来，开展一个大搞肥料、支援农业生产的突击运动。这是城市支援农村的有力的措施和重要任务。
    郊区农村正急需肥料，城市有着丰富的肥源。过去肥料部门虽然组织了专门力量，经常在收集并向农村运送肥料，但由于没有使积肥工作成为群众性的运动，因而有一部分肥料如大粪等流失了，有不少农村视为珍宝的杂肥也没有很好地收集起来加以充分利用。为了把本市丰富的肥源充分地挖掘出来，使之在农业生产中发挥作用，就一定要大搞城市积肥的群众运动。而且，开展群众性的大搞肥料的运动，完全可以与爱国卫生运动密切地结合起来。爱国卫生运动开展得经常、广泛、深入，既能改善城市的环境卫生，又能为农村收集更多的肥料，一举而两得。
    要把积聚的大量肥料及时运送下乡，就一定要认真解决运输的问题。要千方百计地挖掘运输潜力，把运输工作组织得更加合理。要尽可能把往返于城乡之间的水陆交通工具充分利用起来，不要放空车空船。城市主动“送”，农村也要主动地做好“收”的工作，“送”和“收”要互相衔接。这就需要城乡有关部门妥善地进行组织和安排，避免运输上的脱节和浪费现象。
    城市大搞肥料既是群众性的支援农村的突击运动，各有关部门要向广大群众广泛地宣传大搞肥料、支援农业的重要意义，说明农业是国民经济的基础，粮食又是基础的基础，全党全民要一致努力，大办农业，大办粮食。为了增产粮食，就要多积肥料；有了更多的粮食，工农业生产的发展才有更可靠的保证。通过这次宣传动员工作，要使全市人民进一步树立“以农业为基础”的思想，树立支援农业的光荣感和责任感，一方面自觉地投入这次大搞肥料的突击运动，一方面养成为农村积聚和收集肥料的习惯，使城市积肥也能做到经常化，以便有力地支援郊区农业生产的持续跃进。
    为种麦备足肥料
    ——摘自河北日报
    目前，各地正在为多种、种好小麦，展开全面的准备工作。肥料，是庄稼的“粮食”，夺取明年小麦丰收，就必须备足足够的肥料。小麦是有名的“胎里富”作物，根部趋肥性很强，多施基肥，能够使小麦根部发育得更好，为“叶茂”打基础。特别是今年我省小麦播种面积将比去年大大增加，管理水平要求大大高于往年。能不能实现小麦管理高标准、高产量，决定性的关键之一在于能不能多积肥。同时，为了要保证明年春播作物的增产，现在也需要备好一部分优质肥料。
    要准备充足的肥料，必须扎扎实实地贯彻政策，进一步调动广大群众的积肥积极性。要一手抓集体积肥，一手抓社员个人积肥。在集体积肥方面，除了帮助猪场、羊圈、牲口棚、化肥厂、积肥专业队等积肥基地不断地改进积肥方法、增加积肥数量、提高积肥质量外，还应当突出地推行积肥定额责任制度。在抓社员个人积肥上，应当认真地贯彻执行奖励积肥的政策，做到以质论价，肥价兑现。对于积肥多质量好的社员，要进行奖励，树立旗帜，使大积大造肥料成为社会风气。
    要为小麦提早备足更多的肥料，必须早动手、早安排。过去，有的地区积肥动手晚，到用肥时才临时突击，形成“寅积卯施”，不能把肥效用在“刀刃上”。要改变这种被动状况，在积肥上打主动仗，就要全面地作好积、运、用肥的规划，使积肥和其他生产一样，纳入生产计划之内，从现在起就立即动手。
    从现在到播种小麦，只有一个月左右的时间了，各地要抓紧这个好时机，结合田间管理大抓肥料。
    狠抓积肥造肥
    ——摘自内蒙古日报
    为了增产更多的粮食，必须从根本上来解决肥料问题。夏秋之交是突击积肥的大好季节，又是我们建立肥料基地的有利时机。各级党委都要大抓肥料，开展一个既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实的积肥造肥运动，解决当前农作物追肥的需要，同时为明年春播准备相当一部分基肥，并有计划有步骤地把肥料基地建设起来，以便把积肥造肥工作建立在一个坚实可靠的基础上。
    首先要狠抓肥料基地的建设工作，这是从根本上解决肥料问题的关键。在建立肥料基地时不仅要考虑如何使肥料基地能够不断地提供数量多、质量好的肥料，同时根据我区地多人少，运肥距离较长的特点，还要一并解决节省积肥、运肥的人畜力的问题。我区农村每年耗费人力和畜力最多的农活是积肥、送粪，实行畜圈到田的办法对于缓和人畜力的紧张将会起很大的作用。其次是建立绿肥基地。我区阴山丘陵区的群众有压青的习惯，增产的效果也很显著，群众常以“你有麦子窖，我有压青地”的口头语来评价压青的作用。我们应该把推广压青的办法当作一项建设绿肥基地的工作来看待，各地每年都应把当年不能播种的可耕地，尽量多翻一些压青地。第三，是建立化学肥料基地。大跃进以来，各人民公社大办土化肥厂，为建立化肥基地准备了条件。现在，我们要进一步巩固提高这些社办工厂，并选择条件好的扩大生产规模，力争尽快多生产土化肥，供应生产需要。
