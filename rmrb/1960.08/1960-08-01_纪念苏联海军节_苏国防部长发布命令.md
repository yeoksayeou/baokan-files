Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 31st: TASS reported from Moscow on July 31st: The Soviet Minister of Defense, Marshal of the Soviet Union Malinovsky, issued an order today in commemoration of Soviet Navy Day.

The order stated that the aggressive blocs of Western countries are hostile to our motherland and the powerful camp of socialist countries as a whole. They resent their growing prestige and expanding influence on the international stage. Therefore, they are making a dying struggle to maintain a "cold war" atmosphere and fuel the arms race, which favors imperialist monopoly groups.

The order pointed out that the fact that American planes piratically intruded into Soviet airspace and that the American government undermined the summit conference proves that the enemies of peace and socialism are continuing to pursue a policy of adventurism and provocation for their own selfish purposes. Under these circumstances, the Soviet Communist Party and the government are taking all necessary measures to further consolidate the defense capabilities of the Soviet state.

The order said that the task of Soviet naval soldiers, like the task of every member of the Soviet armed forces, is to show high vigilance and maintain combat readiness, in order to give the aggressors a devastating blow if they妄想attempt to undermine the sacred borders of our beloved motherland.

    纪念苏联海军节
    苏国防部长发布命令
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科31日讯：苏联国防部长、苏联元帅马利诺夫斯基今天为纪念苏联海军节颁发命令。
    命令中说，西方国家的侵略集团仇视我们的祖国和整个社会主义国家的强大阵营，痛恨它们在国际舞台上的威望提高和影响扩大，因此他们正在作垂死的挣扎，以便保持住有利于帝国主义垄断集团的“冷战”和热衷于扩充军备的气氛。
    命令指出，美国飞机强盗式的侵入苏联领空和美国政府破坏最高级会议的事实证明，和平和社会主义的敌人为了自己的自私目的正在继续进行着冒险和挑衅的政策。在这种情况下，苏联共产党和政府正在采取一切必要的措施来进一步巩固苏维埃国家的国防能力。
    命令说，苏联海军士兵的任务像苏联武装部队的每一个成员的任务一样，是表现出高度的警惕性和保持战斗准备，以便给侵略者以毁灭性的打击，如果他们妄想破坏我们亲爱祖国的神圣国境的话。
