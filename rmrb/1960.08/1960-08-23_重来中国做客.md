Returning to China as a Guest
Fa·Hu·Nasilietidinuofu

In 1957, when our great Soviet Socialist country was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution, I had the opportunity to visit several cities in the People's Republic of China with the delegation of Soviet artists. All members of our delegation were delighted that the hardworking Chinese people were building their country at a rapid pace and celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution with us. In those days, Beijing and other cities in China were adorned in festive attire.

After a short stay in Beijing, we went to other Chinese cities, such as Zhengzhou, Nanjing, and Xi'an. Wherever we went, we saw that the culture and spirit of the Chinese people were changing rapidly. After visiting the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Burma for two months, we landed at the airport in Kunming, China. Although we were only passing through this city, the people there welcomed us Soviet actors as if we were their own relatives. We held a grand concert for our Chinese friends with great sincerity. The responsible comrades of the Kunming branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a reception to welcome the Soviet actors. After friendly talks, the excellent actors from Kunming performed wonderful programs for us. Each program they performed was full of enthusiasm and possessed high artistic skill. We especially liked the accompanied female and male choruses and other singing programs reflecting the life of ethnic minorities. In particular, the Chinese folk dances were full of beautiful emotions, such as the "Sword Dance" and the "Peacock Dance." We were very surprised to see the Chinese actors perform the "Tatar Youth Dance," they performed it with such enthusiasm and skill, and the "Tajik Dance" was also very moving. After the performance, we warmly congratulated each actor on their outstanding performance and wished our Chinese friends greater achievements in the future development of national art.

I parted ways with my Chinese friends for three years, and now I have come to China again. This time I am here with the Tatar Autonomous Republic National Song and Dance Ensemble for a visit and performance tour. Chinese friends once again warmly welcomed us. We will be visiting and performing in China for about two months. During this period, we will perform in many cities, factories, and construction sites in China.

Our visiting performance program includes Tatar folk songs and the latest works by Soviet Tatar composers. Composer D. Faizi also wrote a song specifically for the song and dance ensemble's visit to China - "To Chinese Friends." Our song and dance ensemble has also learned to sing "The East is Red" and the Chinese folk song "The Half Moon Climbs Up." The dancers of our song and dance ensemble will perform friendship dances of various ethnic groups and various other dance programs. We will also introduce to the audience the new works of Tatar composers, including: A. Kryuchalov's "New Kazan" and "Working for Peace," K. N. Zhiganov's "My Republic," Khalminov's "Ode to Lenin," D. Faizi's "Happy Spring," as well as the Moscow composer Novikov's "Song of Siberian Youth" and other works.

We believe that through this visit and performance tour, our friendship will become stronger and closer.

We have personally witnessed the tremendous victories achieved by the Chinese people in socialist construction and cultural construction in a short period of time.

    重来中国做客
    法·胡·纳斯列特季诺夫
    1957年，当我们伟大的苏维埃社会主义国家庆祝伟大十月革命四十周年的时候，我曾有机会跟随苏联艺术工作者代表团到过中华人民共和国的好几个城市。我们代表团全体团员，都为勤劳的中国人民以飞快的速度在建设着自己的国家，并且和我们一起共同庆祝十月革命四十周年而感到高兴。那些日子，北京和中国的其他城市都披上了节日的盛装。
    在北京短期逗留以后，我们又到了中国的其他城市，如郑州、南京、西安。无论我们在哪里，我们都看到了中国人民的文化和精神面貌在飞快地变化着。在越南民主共和国和缅甸作客了两个月以后，我们又乘飞机降落在中国昆明的机场上。虽然我们仅仅是路过这个城市，但是那里的人们却像对待自己的亲人一样欢迎我们苏联演员。我们怀着极大的诚意为中国朋友们举行了盛大的音乐会。中苏友好协会昆明分会负责同志为欢迎苏联演员们举行了招待会。在友好的谈话以后，昆明的优秀演员们为我们演出了精彩的节目。他们演出的每个节目都充满热情，并具有很高的艺术技巧。我们非常喜欢那些反映少数民族生活的带伴奏的女声和男声小合唱以及其他歌唱节目。尤其是中国的民间舞蹈充满了优美的情感，像《剑舞》、《孔雀舞》等。看了中国演员演出的《鞑靼青年舞》，使我们大吃一惊，他们演得那样热情熟练，《塔吉克舞》也演得非常动人。演出结束后，我们热烈地祝贺每个演员的卓越演出，并预祝我们的中国朋友在今后发展民族艺术上获得更大的成就。
    我和中国朋友们分别了三年，现在我又来到了中国。这一次我是和鞑靼自治共和国国家歌舞团一起来作访问演出的。中国朋友又一次热情地欢迎我们。我们将在中国进行两个月左右的访问演出。在这期间，我们将要到中国许多城市以及工厂和工地演出。
    我们访问演出的节目包括了鞑靼的民间歌曲和苏联鞑靼作曲家的最新作品。作曲家德·法依齐还专为歌舞团的访华演出写了一首歌曲——《致中国朋友》。我们歌舞团还学会了用中文演唱《东方红》和中国民歌《半个月亮爬上来》。我们歌舞团的舞蹈演员们将表演各民族的友谊舞和其他各种各样的舞蹈节目。我们还要向观众们介绍鞑靼作曲家的新作品，其中有：阿·克留恰辽夫的《新喀山》、《为和平劳动》，卡·尼·日甘诺夫的《我的共和国》，哈尔米诺夫的《列宁颂》，德·法依齐的《快乐的春天》，还有莫斯科作曲家诺维科夫的《西伯利亚青年之歌》以及其他作品。
    我们认为，通过这次的访问演出，我们的友谊将会更加牢固，更加亲密。
    我们亲眼看到了中国人民在社会主义建设和文化建设道路上，在短短的期间内获得了巨大的胜利。
