    Comprehensive Promotion of Various Advanced Leadership Methods
    The Aganzhen Coal Mine's Implementation of the Twenty-Four Character Leadership Experience Effectively Promoted Production
    (Our newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch, August 2nd) The Aganzhen Coal Mine in Lanzhou City has vigorously improved leadership methods, actively promoting a complete set of working methods such as "Circuit Inspection, On-site Convergence, Office Work Underground, Mobile Command, Fixed Linkage, and On-site Meetings," making the leadership methods "a coordinated whole," which has powerfully promoted production. Coal production in mid-July increased by 4% compared to the first ten days of the month. Since July, there have been no major casualties, and the attendance rate has also increased.
    Under the assistance of the Lanzhou Municipal Party Committee and the Provincial Coal Industry Bureau's working group, after full discussion from top to bottom and bottom to top, the entire mine comprehensively implemented the twenty-four character leadership method in mid-June.
    Circuit Inspection. Leading cadres, along with the main staff of functional departments, go deep into the front line of production to conduct inspections, identify problems, distinguish between primary and secondary priorities, and assign specific personnel to be responsible for solving them.
    On-site Convergence. Based on major problems discovered during circuit inspections, leading cadres, technicians, and workers converge on-site to jointly diagnose and solve them by pooling the wisdom of the masses.
    Office Work Underground. This is a specific method for cadres to deepen the system of going to the front line of production. The underground office is also the executive agency for implementing the aforementioned two working methods. The mine, taking the mining area as a unit, forms a production command group composed of district, team, and squad leaders, Party, Youth League, and trade union leaders, and workers, who participate in production underground and lead the production of the shift. Because cadres and workers labor together underground and jointly manage production, many problems can be quickly discussed and resolved on the spot. The underground office often has district chiefs, technicians, and material clerks on duty. They adopt the method of "staying at a point and rotating around," grasping the production of the current shift with one hand and grasping the main links of preparatory work such as tunneling and lane selection with the other. The underground office of the No. 2 Mining Area of Shimen Pit mouth has people on duty 24 hours a day, and the work is meticulous and comprehensive, achieving a double leap forward in extraction and tunneling, and preparing a month's extraction working face in twenty days.
    Mobile Command. In order to better combine points and areas in leading production, the mine has a mobile production command headquarters, and a command post above ground. Underground office work focuses on points, while mobile command focuses on areas. In this way, any problems that the underground office cannot solve can be quickly resolved by the mobile command headquarters (post).
    Fixed Linkage. This is a method for cadres to comprehensively deepen the front line of production and specifically help grassroots units do a good job. Responsible cadres of all departments in the mine have been separately and permanently linked with the grassroots units in the mining area; more than 70% of the general cadres have also been linked with the district, team, squad, and group of the pit mouth, specifically helping grassroots units improve their work. Their specific practice is: each cadre has a "linkage" plan every week. Except for meetings, learning, and handling daily affairs at the mine on Tuesdays and Fridays, they all go to the linked units and eat, live, work, and discuss with the workers on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, fully contracting in terms of production, ideology, life, and safety, and being responsible to the end. After Yu Fawen, the head of the Labor and Wages Section, was linked with the No. 2 Mining Area of Shimen Pit mouth, he worked with the workers and helped the mining area reverse the situation where tunneling could not keep up with extraction. Adopting the method of fixed linkage, on the one hand, can make the cadre's work, study, and going down the pit be properly arranged, so that they are busy but not chaotic, save time, and combine work and rest; on the other hand, it can also enable all units in the mine to leap forward together.
    They also use the method of holding on-site meetings to vigorously promote the experience gained in "Circuit Inspection, On-site Convergence, Office Work Underground, Mobile Command, and Fixed Linkage," timely commend advanced individuals, and achieve the purpose of exchanging experience, summarizing, and evaluating.
    The practice of the past month has proved that this set of working systems has many benefits. First, it strengthens the leadership of the front line of production, facilitates timely understanding of the situation, timely resolution of problems, and makes the leadership work more in-depth, meticulous, and practical. Second, the twenty-four characters complement each other, making work arrangements detailed, overcoming the past phenomena of chaotic management, too many meetings and reports, and only division of labor but lack of cooperation. Third, it further strengthens the relationship between cadres and the masses, truly enabling cadres to grasp the workers' ideological situation and workers to understand the intentions of the cadres.

    全面推行各种先进领导方法
    阿干镇煤矿推行二十四字的领导经验有力地促进了生产
    本报兰州2日电　兰州市阿干镇煤矿大力改进领导方法，积极推行“巡回检查，现场会师，井下办公，流动指挥，固定挂钩，现场会议”等一整套工作方法，使领导方法“配套成龙”，有力地促进了生产。煤产量7月中旬比上旬上升4％，7月份以来没有发生重大的伤亡事故，出勤率也提高了。
    这个矿在中共兰州市委和省煤炭工业局工作组的帮助下，经过自上而下和自下而上的充分讨论，全矿在6月中旬全面地推行了二十四个字的领导方法。
    巡回检查。领导干部带领职能科室的主要工作人员，深入生产第一线，来回检查，发现问题，分清主次缓急，指定专人负责解决。
    现场会师。根据巡回检查中发现的重大问题，领导干部、技术人员和工人到现场会师，共同诊断，集中群众的智慧加以解决。
    井下办公。这是干部深入生产第一线制度化的具体办法。井下办公室也是贯彻前述两项工作方法的执行机构。这个矿以采区为单位，由区、队、班长，党、团、工会组长和工人共同组成生产指挥小组，在井下参加生产，并且领导当班生产。由于干部和工人一起在井下劳动，共同管理生产，许多问题可以很快地当场商量、解决。井下办公室经常有区长、技术员和材料员值班，他们采取“蹲点转圈”的办法，一手抓当班生产，一手抓准备工作的掘进和选道等主要环节。石门坑口二采区井下办公室，一天二十四小时都有人值班办公，工作抓得细致全面，做到回采、掘进双跃进，二十天就准备出一个月的回采工作面。
    流动指挥。为了在领导生产中做到点面更好地结合，这个矿设有生产流动指挥部，坑上设有指挥所。井下办公是以点为主，流动指挥则是以面为主。这样，凡是井下办公室不能解决的问题，流动指挥部（所）就可以很快地加以解决。
    固定挂钩。这是干部全面深入生产第一线，具体帮助基层单位搞好工作的方法。这个矿各科室的负责干部，已经全部分别同坑区的各基层单位固定挂钩；一般干部70％以上也和坑口的区、队、班、小组挂了钩，具体帮助基层单位改进工作。他们的具体作法是：每个干部每周都订有“挂钩”的计划，除每星期二、五在矿上开会、学习和处理日常事务外，一、三、四、六全部去挂钩单位和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，在生产、思想、生活、安全等方面全部包干，一包到底。劳动工资科长于发文和石门坑口二采区挂钩以后，和工人在一起劳动，帮助这个采区扭转了掘进赶不上回采的局面。采取固定挂钩的办法，一方面可以使干部工作、学习、下井得到妥善安排，做到忙而不乱，节约时间，劳逸结合；另一方面也可以使全矿所有的单位都能一齐跃进。
    他们还采用开现场会议的办法，来大力推广“巡回检查、现场会师、井下办公、流动指挥、固定挂钩”中所取得的经验，及时表扬先进，达到交流经验、总结评比的目的。
    最近一个月的实践证明，这一套工作制度有很多好处。第一，加强了生产第一线的领导，便于及时了解情况，及时解决问题，使领导工作更加深入、细致、踏实。第二，二十四个字互相补充，使工作安排细致，克服了过去管理工作乱、会议和报表多，以及只有分工缺少合作等现象。第三，进一步密切了干部和群众的关系，真正做到干部掌握工人的思想情况，工人领会干部的意图。
