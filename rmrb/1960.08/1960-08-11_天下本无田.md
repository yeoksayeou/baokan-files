    "There Was Originally No Farmland Under Heaven..."
    Lu Li
    There was originally no farmland under heaven, farmland is reclaimed by people,
    Any land can be reclaimed into farmland, any farmland can be cultivated into a garden.
    This is a folk rhyme written by the masses themselves in the rural areas of Hubei Province during the land reclamation campaign. It makes sense. Before recorded history, there was indeed no farmland. Later, due to the development of mankind, people reclaimed "barren" land into "farmland" for cultivation. Due to the hard work of generations of working people, the farmland under heaven gradually went from nothing to something, from few to many, from bad to good. This makes us understand a truth: the process of reclaiming and cultivating land is the process of mankind conquering nature, and it is also the process of human self-development, and now this process has not yet been completed. If we want to rapidly develop China's agriculture and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, we must further reclaim barren land into farmland and cultivate bad farmland into good farmland.
    Nature's potential is infinite. Nature is simply a cornucopia, with inexhaustible treasures within. Turning barren land into farmland, allowing every inch of soil to grow things useful to socialism, can only be said to have opened the cornucopia and obtained a little treasure. Going deeper, cultivating all the fields well, as well as a vegetable garden, with high yields, one can obtain even more treasure. There are treasures in the cornucopia, the question is whether you are willing to take them, dare to take them. As long as you have the determination and drive, and work diligently, you will not be in vain, and you will get a lot of grain, cotton, oil, and other agricultural products from this cornucopia. If you don't go and do it, don't want to do it, don't dare to do it, no one will ever bring grain, cotton, oil, and other agricultural products to you on a plate.
    "There was originally no farmland under heaven..." This folk rhyme not only reveals the secrets of nature, but more importantly, it demonstrates the revolutionary spirit of the heroic people conquering nature. In the eyes of Marxists, nature is a material and objective thing, it has its own laws of motion, and people cannot act recklessly against the laws of nature; but at the same time, they also believe that once people understand the laws of nature, grasp the laws of nature, they can use the laws of nature, control nature, and transform nature's dominance over people into people's dominance over nature; this transformation, the decisive role, is the subjective initiative of people. And now, we already have the conditions to dominate nature to a considerable extent. First, let's look at the "people" of our era! Our people—the people of the Mao Zedong era, the people of the era of people's communes, the people with communist ideological awareness, the people with soaring enthusiasm—not only have the strength, but also have the means to dominate nature. We have the strength because under the leadership of the Party, 650 million people have formed a great collective; we have the means because, based on the experience of our predecessors, with the continuous leap forward of production, practice has promoted people's understanding and the development of natural science, and we already have considerable experience in dominating nature. Faced with our current reality, we have every right to say: as long as we dare to think and dare to do, and work diligently, conquering nature and making nature better serve mankind is no longer an ideal, but a reality. In Li Dagui's locality in Jun County, Hubei, it used to be a place of poor mountains and bad waters, and generations had three meals a day of "mountain stakes" (eating sweet potatoes). Li Dagui dared to think and dared to do, and brought river water up the mountain. Now he is eating rice without any reservation. Isn't this conquering nature?
    All the barren land under heaven can be reclaimed for cultivation, and all the bad farmland under heaven can be transformed into good farmland. The problem is to have the spirit of "There was originally no farmland under heaven...", firmly believe in the truth that poor mountains and bad waters can be completely changed, and thereby, with the attitude of the master of nature, work hard, work diligently, work skillfully, and work practically. "Where there is a will, there is a way." If we persevere, why worry about not achieving a life of abundance!

### “天下本无田……”

    “天下本无田……”
    鲁力
    天下本无田，田是人开的，
    是地都能开成田，是田都能种成园。
    这是湖北省农村在开荒运动中，群众自己写的一个顺口溜。这是有道理的。在有史以前，确实是没有田的。后来，由于人类的发展，人们把“荒芜”的地开成“田”来种植。由于劳动人民祖祖辈辈胼手胝足地开，天下的田才逐渐从无到有，从少到多，从坏到好。这使我们明白了一个道理：开田和种田的过程，是人类征服自然的过程，也是人类自身发展的过程，而现在，这个过程也还没有完成。我们要迅速发展我国农业，多快好省地建设社会主义，就要进一步把荒芜的土地开成田，把坏田种成好田。
    自然的潜力是无穷无尽的。大自然简直就是一个大宝葫芦，在这个宝葫芦里面，有取之不尽用之不竭的珍宝。把荒地开成田，让每一寸土都能长出对社会主义有用的东西，这只能说是打开了宝葫芦，才拿到了一点宝，再深一层，把所有的田都种好，种得像菜园子那样好，产量很高，又能拿到更多的宝。宝胡芦里都有宝，问题就看你愿不愿去拿，敢不敢去拿。只要你有决心有干劲，踏踏实实地干，就不会徒劳，就会从这个宝胡芦里头取到许许多多的粮食、棉花、油料和其他农产品。你不去干，不愿干，不敢干，永远没有人用盘子把粮食、棉花、油料和其他农产品给端过来。
    “天下本无田……”这个顺口溜，不仅揭示了自然的秘密，更重要的，是显示了英雄人民征服自然的革命气概。在马克思主义者看来，自然是物质的客观的东西，它有它自己的运动规律，人们不能违背自然的规律而胡作非为；但同时又认为，一旦人们认识了自然的规律，掌握了自然的规律，就可以运用自然的规律，驾驭自然，由自然对人的支配，转化为人对自然的支配；这种转化，起决定作用的，是人的主观能动性。而现在，我们已经在相当程度上具备了这种支配自然的条件。首先看看我们时代的“人”吧！我们的人——毛泽东时代的人，人民公社化时代的人，有共产主义思想觉悟的人，干劲冲天的人，不仅有力量，也有办法来支配自然。我们有力量，是因为我们在党的领导下，六亿五千万人已经结成了一个伟大的集体；我们有办法，是因为我们在前人经验的基础上，随着生产的持续跃进，实践推动了人的认识和自然科学的发展，已经有相当的支配自然的经验。面对着我们当前的现实，我们完全有权利这样说：只要我们敢想敢干，踏踏实实地干，征服自然，让自然更好地为人类服务，已经不是理想，而是现实了。湖北均县李大贵所在地，过去是穷山恶水，祖祖辈辈一天三顿“靠山桩”（吃红薯），李大贵敢想敢干，把河水引上山，现在就不客气地吃起大米了，这不是征服了自然吗？
    天下的荒地都能开出来耕种，天下的坏田都能被改造成好田，问题是要有“天下本无田……”的气概，坚信穷山恶水完全可以改变的真理，从而以大自然主人翁的态度，大干特干苦干巧干实干，“有志者事竟成”，坚持干下去，何愁达不到丰衣足食呢！
