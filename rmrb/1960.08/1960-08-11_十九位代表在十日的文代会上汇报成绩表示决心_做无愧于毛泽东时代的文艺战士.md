Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: The general session of the Third Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers continued this afternoon. Nineteen representatives made oral and written speeches at the meeting.

    The Inner Mongolia representatives Zhulan Qiqike, Damulin, and Wang Yongzhen said in a joint speech that since the Great Leap Forward, with the great development of production, a new type of film art has also been born in Inner Mongolia. In order to record this great era and reflect the ever-changing changes in the autonomous region, film workers traveled north and south, carrying cameras to run all over the more than one million square kilometers of Inner Mongolia, and in the past year or so, they have produced feature films such as "Prairie Morning Song" (co-produced with Changchun Film Studio) and documentaries such as "Good Pastoral Commune", "Golden Chuan Wheat Waves", "Automobile Soldiers on the Xing'an Mountains", "Baogang Album" and many other films. These films reflect socialist construction and the people's Great Leap Forward.

    Liu Dajie, a researcher of classical literature, made a speech entitled "Promote the Proletarian and Eliminate the Bourgeois, Destroy the Old and Establish the New" on how to treat literary heritage. He believes that the study of literary heritage must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to discard the dross and select the essence, critically absorb, innovate, and use the past for the present. We must strengthen the ability to analyze and criticize, and proceed from the realistic significance of today, so that they can truly serve socialist literature.

    The film industry representative Te Wei said in his speech: Fine arts film workers should strive to master the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, and continuously enrich and innovate in terms of themes and styles, so that fine arts films can become a powerful tool for the Party to educate the broad masses of people with communist ideology.

    Li Jin, a representative from Jiangsu Province, talked about the issue of literature and art serving agriculture. He introduced how the Wujiang County Xiju Troupe has been performing in rural areas for eight years, encouraging the production enthusiasm of farmers and improving the ideological and artistic level of literary and art workers.

    Film actress Tian Hua said in her speech that she would continue to carry out revolutionary training under the education of the Party and devote herself to the fiery struggle.

    Huo Mansheng, a peasant poet from Liaoning who had worked as a hired laborer for landlords for twenty-nine years, narrated in his speech full of poems how he used the weapon of poetry to fight against national enemies and class enemies; how he praised the leadership of the Party and encouraged the people's revolutionary enthusiasm and production drive.

    Liu Chunquan, a Xiang opera actress, vividly talked about how the Party gradually cultivated her from an old artist into a glorious Communist Party member, and how she contributed her strength in sorting out and performing many excellent traditional plays such as "The Death and Life Tablet".

    The Fujian Province representatives Zheng Yizou, Li Shengbin, Yin Guifang, and Wang Min introduced in a joint speech that the art groups in Fujian Province often went to the coastal defense front line to perform for the heroic commanders and fighters who guarded the motherland day and night. They expressed their determination to resolutely stand at the forefront of the opposition to imperialism and contribute all their strength to the liberation of Taiwan, our sacred territory.

    Bai Shui, a representative from Shanghai, talked about the experience of the Shanghai Experimental Opera House in creating the first large-scale ballet "The Small Swords Society", saying that to create a ballet with nationalization and mass character, expressing the history of revolutionary struggle and heroic figures, it is necessary to have the courage to overcome difficulties and the creative spirit of bold innovation without fear of failure.

    The Tibetan female representative Caidan Zhuoma excitedly talked about how she grew from the daughter of a serf into a people's singer. Four years ago, this Tibetan girl with singing talent was still suffering from hunger and working as a beast of burden for the landlord. The Party cultivated and educated her and sent her to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music to study, which greatly improved her politically and artistically. In her speech, Caidan Zhuoma sincerely thanked the Party for its cultivation, and finally, she ended her speech with a beautiful song praising Chairman Mao.

    Four other representatives made written speeches at the meeting today. Wang Chaowen made a speech on how art works should express the heroic era of the people; Ya Ma talked about the experience of Changchun Film Studio in implementing the direction of serving workers, peasants and soldiers for ten years; Bai Yang said in a written speech that she must be an actor worthy of the Mao Zedong era, constantly revolutionizing and advancing; Ding Ling said in a written speech, examined the ideological roots of her mistakes, and expressed that she would thoroughly transform herself and strive to return to the revolutionary literary and art family as soon as possible.

    藏族女代表才旦卓玛激动地谈到她怎样由一个农奴的女儿成长为人民歌唱家的过程。四年前，这位有歌唱天才的藏族姑娘还在忍饥挨饿地给地主当牛马。党培养教育了她，送她到上海音乐学院学习，使她在政治上和艺术上都得到很大提高。才旦卓玛在发言中衷心感谢党的培养，最后她用歌颂毛主席的动听歌唱，结束了发言。
