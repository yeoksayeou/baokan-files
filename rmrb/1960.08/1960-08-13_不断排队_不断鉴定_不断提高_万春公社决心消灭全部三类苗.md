Continuous Screening, Continuous Assessment, Continuous Improvement
    Wanchun Commune Determined to Eliminate All Category Three Seedlings

According to Sichuan Daily, during the paddy field management period, the Wanchun People's Commune in Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, continuously screened and assessed seedlings. After three consecutive rounds of concentrated efforts to eliminate Category Three seedlings, the proportion of Category Three seedlings in the commune's rice fields decreased from the initial 30% of the total area to 5%, while the proportion of Category One and Two seedlings increased dramatically. Currently, the commune members are continuing to seize the opportunity to make concentrated efforts, determined to eliminate all Category Three seedlings, so that every plant has many large, high-yielding ears, leading to a bumper harvest.

Wanchun Commune planted more than 87,000 mu of rice this year. Before transplanting, generally, the seeds were disinfected thoroughly, the seedlings were cultivated robustly, and more fertilizer was applied to poor fields. Therefore, a large area of rice grew strongly, generally better than last year. However, the Commune Party Committee was not satisfied with the existing achievements. Under the guidance of the idea of large-area, balanced, and high yield, in order to make every rice field high-yielding, they were determined to lead the masses to do the field management work more meticulously and solidly. Therefore, at the beginning of the field management, they led the management areas and production teams, composed of cadres, members' representatives, and experienced farmers, to form field inspection teams to check the rice growth. In the initial inspection and assessment, it was found that in the Gongping Central Management Area, more than 3,000 mu of submerged fields had seedlings that were not tillering and growing poorly, forming Category Three seedlings. It was then discovered that in the Shengli Management Area, about 400 mu of land had better soil quality and sufficient base fertilizer. The seedlings grew well during the first weeding, but because the topdressing was not followed up in time, the seedlings generally turned yellow and also became Category Three seedlings. According to the commune's statistics, there were a total of 25,000 mu of Category Three seedlings, accounting for about 30% of the mid-season rice area. The Party Committee believed that this situation was relatively serious, and put forward the slogan of resolutely eliminating Category Three seedlings and seizing an all-round bumper harvest.

On the basis of unified understanding, the Commune Party Committee mobilized the masses to discuss specific measures to eliminate Category Three seedlings, requiring each mu of Category Three seedling field to quickly apply 20 piculs of manure water, about 1,500 jin of green manure, and 200 jin of lime. Moreover, measures were tailored to the fields and seedlings, and targeted treatments were applied. In addition to general weeding and hoeing, it was specifically determined that for cold submerged fields and acidic fields, drainage should be strengthened, focusing on applying lime and green manure to increase soil temperature and accelerate fertilizer decomposition, so as to promote seedling tillering. For Category Three seedlings in high fields, the main application was manure water and ash residue to promote seedling growth. For Category Three seedlings in remote fields, more chemical fertilizer should be applied to reduce transportation labor, save time, and promote their rapid transformation. Subsequently, the entire commune tapped the labor potential from the commune, management area-level farms, Red and Expert Schools, and commune-run industries, so that 70%-80% of the labor force was invested in the front line of field management.

In order to ensure the complete elimination of Category Three seedlings, the "Five Fixes and One Guarantee" method and inspection and acceptance system were universally implemented in all management areas and production teams. Generally, according to the distribution of Category Three seedlings, leaders, labor, plots, fertilizer, and time were fixed, and responsibility was contracted for eliminating Category Three seedlings. This approach, with clear responsibilities and specific measures, effectively mobilized everyone's enthusiasm. In order to help members complete the "Five Fixes and One Guarantee" task, Tang Qiming, the Party Branch Secretary of the Jinma Management Area, cut more than 1,000 jin of green grass every day during the elimination of Category Three seedlings. Under his leadership, cadres and members launched the "go out with a load of fertilizer, come back with a load of grass" campaign, actively accumulating and transporting fertilizer to make concentrated efforts to eliminate Category Three seedlings. While implementing the "Five Fixes and One Guarantee," various management areas also universally launched a competition to eliminate Category Three seedlings. Based on the fact that it takes more than seven days to see results in treating Category Three seedlings, everyone used one week as a period to carry out cyclical competitions and make concentrated efforts in rotation. From the beginning of July to the end of July, the entire commune has carried out three consecutive rounds of concentrated efforts, upgrading Category Three seedlings step by step. When the Second Production Team of the Liaoyuan Management Area began to make concentrated efforts to eliminate Category Three seedlings, they only applied the existing fertilizer to the fields, applying only a few piculs of fertilizer per mu, and the seedlings did not change much. Afterwards, they established the "Five Fixes and One Guarantee" responsibility system and launched a competition, mobilizing members to carry out a high-efficiency campaign to accumulate, transport, and apply fertilizer. The members transported manure from Wenjiang City, and the entire production team transported back more than 1,000 dan in a few days, applying more than 30 dan of topdressing fertilizer to each mu of Category Three seedlings. After three consecutive rounds of concentrated efforts, not only were all the Category Three seedlings in the team eliminated, but also a batch of fertilizer was freed up to apply topdressing to Category Two seedlings, promoting the upgrading of Category Two seedlings as well. According to the inspection at the end of July, more than 20,000 mu of the commune's 25,000 mu of Category Three seedlings had been upgraded to Category Two or Category One seedlings, and the remaining more than 4,000 mu of Category Three seedlings were also changing their appearance. Now, the members are continuing to make concentrated efforts to rush to treat the seedlings, ensuring that all Category Three seedlings are completely eliminated in the shortest possible time.

In order to win a large-area, balanced, and high yield of rice, the Shadu Production Team of the Tangtou Commune in Sinan County, Guizhou Province, launched a campaign to "catch up weak seedlings with strong seedlings, and catch up late seedlings with early seedlings."

    不断排队　不断鉴定　不断提高
    万春公社决心消灭全部三类苗
    据四川日报消息　四川省温江县万春人民公社在水稻田间管理期间，不断排队，不断鉴定，经过连续三次轮番突击消灭三类苗，已使全公社水稻三类苗由最初占总面积的30％下降到5％，一、二类苗所占的比例急剧上升。目前，社员们继续抓紧时机突击，决心全部消灭三类苗，使株株穗多穗大、高产丰收。
    万春公社今年共种了八万七千多亩水稻。栽插之前，一般都做到了种子消毒严、秧苗培育壮、瘦田多施肥，因而大面积水稻长得健壮，普遍比去年好。然而公社党委并不满足已有成绩，在大面积平衡高产的思想指导下，为了使块块稻田高产，决心领导群众把田间管理工作做得更细致扎实。因此，在进入田间管理初期，便领导各管理区、生产队，由干部、社员代表和老农等组成田间检查组，检查水稻生长情况。在最初一次检查鉴定中发现：公平中心管理区有三千多亩漕田，栽下的秧子不发蔸，生长得不好，形成三类苗。接着又发现：胜利管理区约四百亩田土质较好，底肥也不算少，薅头道秧时秧苗长得不错，可是因为追肥没有及时跟上，秧苗普遍翻黄，也变成了三类苗。据全公社统计，共有二万五千亩三类苗，占中稻面积的30％左右。党委会认为这个情况比较严重，便提出坚决消灭三类苗，夺取全面丰收的口号。
    在统一认识的基础上，公社党委又发动群众讨论了消灭三类苗的具体措施，要求每亩三类苗田迅速增施二十挑粪水、一千五百斤左右青肥、二百斤石灰；并且因田因苗制宜，对症下药，轮番突击，除一般的薅秧、除草外，具体确定对冷漕田和酸性田，加强排水工作，着重施石灰、青草肥，以提高地温加速肥料分解，促使秧窝发蔸；高田内的三类苗，主要加施粪水和灰渣提苗；出现三类苗的远田则多配施化肥，以减少运输劳力，争取时间，促其尽快转变。接着，全社从公社、管理区一级的农场、红专学校、社办工业等方面挖掘劳动潜力，使70％—80％的劳力投入了田间管理第一线。
    为了保证把三类苗彻底消灭掉，全社各个管理区和生产队普遍推行了“五定一包”的方法和检查验收制度。一般都根据三类苗分布的情况，实行定领导、定劳力、定田块、定肥料、定时间，包干负责消灭三类苗。这种作法，责任分明、措施具体，有效地调动了大家的积极性。为了帮助社员完成“五定一包”任务，金马管理区党支部书记唐启明，在消灭三类苗期间，每天割青草一千多斤，干部和社员们在他的带动下，掀起了“出门一担肥，收工一担草”的运动，主动积运肥料突击消灭三类苗。在贯彻“五定一包”的同时，各个管理区还普遍开展消灭三类苗的竞赛。大家根据治理三类苗需要七天以上才能见效的情况，都以一周为期，开展循环竞赛，轮番突击。全公社从7月初到7月下旬，已连续进行三次突击，使三类苗步步升级。燎原管理区第二生产队开始突击消灭三类苗时，只将现有肥料下田，每亩施了几挑肥料，秧子转变不大；之后，建立了“五定一包”责任制和开展了竞赛，发动社员开展积、运、施肥的高工效运动，社员们到温江城关挑运粪肥，全生产队几天中就运回一千多担，给每亩三类苗追肥三十多担。一连三次突击，不仅使全队的三类苗全部消灭，而且还腾出一批肥料给二类苗加施追肥，促使二类苗也升了级。据7月下旬检查，全公社二万五千亩三类苗，已有二万多亩升为二类苗或一类苗，其余的四千多亩三类苗也正在改变面貌。现在，社员们还在继续突击抢治，保证在最短期间全部彻底消灭三类苗。（附图片）
