Opening the Way for Advanced Experience

Qian Jianglong, deputy secretary of the Party branch of the Jiangjun Production Team of the Sheshan People's Commune in Songjiang County, Shanghai, went deep into the pig farm and quickly promoted advanced experience. As a result, the pig farm had good performance in every shed and with every pig, and the work developed very evenly.

In the past, everyone said that "runt pigs" could not be raised, but this superstition was completely broken through a pig shed on-site meeting. At that time, Communist Party member and breeder Shen Huxiang made a bold pledge to raise "runt pigs" and raise them well. After Qian Jianglong discovered this new sprout, he gave him great support and encouragement. At that time, a sow managed by Shen Huxiang gave birth to sixteen piglets, two of which were "runt pigs". Shen Huxiang stayed by the sow's side, carefully taking care of the piglets. When the sow nursed, he moved the two piglets to the nipples, allowing them to eat first; when the sow turned over, he quickly moved the two piglets away to prevent them from being crushed to death. Finally, he raised the two "runt pigs" that were as small as mice when they were born. Grasping this advanced bud, Qian Jianglong immediately held an on-site meeting in the pig shed managed by Shen Huxiang and commended Shen Huxiang. After everyone's discussion, the superstition that "runt pigs" could not be raised was broken, and Shen Huxiang's experience was promoted. In the first three months of this year, all six "runt pigs" in the farm were raised very well after careful care by the breeders. (Attached picture)

    为先进经验开路
    上海市松江县佘山人民公社将军生产队党支部副书记钱江龙，深入到养猪场，迅速推广先进经验。因此，这个养猪场棚棚都好、头头都好，工作发展非常平衡。
    过去，大家都说“落脚猪”是养不活的，但通过一次猪棚现场会，彻底破除了这种迷信。当时共产党员、饲养员沈虎祥立下雄心壮志，偏要把“落脚猪”养活、养好。钱江龙发现这一新生幼芽后，给了他极大的支持和鼓励。当时沈虎祥管理的一头母猪产了十六头小猪，其中两头是“落脚猪”，沈虎祥一直守在母猪身旁悉心地照顾小猪，母猪喂奶时，他就把这两头小猪搬到奶头旁，让它们最先吃奶；母猪翻身时，又连忙把这两头小猪移开，防止压死，终于把生下时只有老鼠那么大的两头“落脚猪”养活了。抓住这个先进苗头，钱江龙马上在沈虎祥负责管理的猪棚里召开现场会议，表扬了沈虎祥。经过大家讨论，破除了“落脚猪”养不活的迷信，并推广了沈虎祥的经验。今年头三个月，全场六头“落脚猪”，经过饲养员的认真护理，全都养得很好。（附图片）
