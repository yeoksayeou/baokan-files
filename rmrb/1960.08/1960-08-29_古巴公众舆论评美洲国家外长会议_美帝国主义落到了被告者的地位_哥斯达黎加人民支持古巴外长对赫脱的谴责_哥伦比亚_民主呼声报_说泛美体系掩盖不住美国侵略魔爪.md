Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 27th. The Cuban "Hoy" published an editorial today on the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of American States, saying that US imperialism, which wanted to play the role of plaintiff at the Costa Rican Foreign Ministers' meeting, fell into the position of the accused and was condemned by world opinion.

The newspaper pointed out that the position of those who attempted to encircle Cuba is clear, and all sophistry has gone bankrupt. The true face of US imperialism's aggression and exploitation of Latin America has been exposed to world opinion.

When talking about the attitude of Latin American countries at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, "Hoy" said that when the people of a country are determined to realize the great slogan of "Swearing to Defend the Motherland," its friends should also assume their due responsibilities.

A commentary published by "Calle" pointed out that our experience in struggle proves that as long as a small country is internally united, it can resist powerful interest groups that oppose it. The newspaper pointed out that a weak nation opposes a powerful country like the United States, and has no fear of the "sacred" behemoth of Wall Street, the Pentagon, and the White House, which means that things are not only changing in Cuba, but also decisively changing all over the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 27th. The shameless slander by the US government against the international labor team currently helping the Cuban people build a school city in the Sierra Maestra mountains of Cuba was today denounced by relevant people here as a complete fabrication. These people pointed out that the United States is spreading such shameless lies to create an excuse for US intervention in Cuba.

On August 22, the US delegation headed by Secretary of State Herter submitted a document to the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of the Organization of American States, falsely accusing the international labor team's participation in the construction of the school city as formulating "training plans for communist agents and guerrillas in order to spread the communist revolution throughout Latin America."

According to people in relevant authorities, the actual situation is that young people from various countries participating in this labor team are building beautiful gardens in the Camilo Cienfuegos school city. These young people come from thirty-eight countries, including Latin American countries and the United States, and they came to Cuba at the invitation of the Cuban Rebel Army Youth Federation through the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Among them are model workers, farmers, students and technicians.

The US government's slander of the international labor team has aroused strong anger among the public here. Rebel Army Youth Federation leader Major Joel Iglesias told reporters today, "They hate us because we are building educational centers in poor areas that used to belong to feudal landlords." Major Iglesias said, "We will continue our construction despite the crazy opposition from the United States, and the international labor team will continue to work." He quoted Premier Castro as saying that if the enemy dares to invade Cuba, "we will not hesitate to defend every inch of our land with our lives."

The Rebel Army Youth Federation has sent a telegram to Herter condemning the US slander.

The National Committee of the Cuban Socialist Youth League issued a written statement to the press, expressing its gratitude to the young people from all over the world who participated in the international labor team for their assistance to Cuba. The statement warned Herter that if US imperialism dares to launch an aggression against Cuba, it will be defeated by the united forces of the world.

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th. San José dispatch: Cuban Foreign Minister Roa's speech at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of the Organization of American States on August 25 condemning US aggression against Cuba has been warmly supported by the people of San José, the capital of Costa Rica, where the meeting is being held. Public opinion believes that Cuban Foreign Minister Roa's speech condemning the United States is the most shocking condemnation of imperialism's aggression against Latin America. The Costa Rican "Adelante" published relevant news on August 26 with the large headline "Noble and Heroic Cuba: The Whole World Stands with You" in a prominent position.

The Costa Rican General Confederation of Labor held workers' meetings in almost all factories, workshops and production units, and passed resolutions demanding respect for Cuba's sovereignty and condemning imperialist aggression. Union leader Gonzalo Sierra said, "The Costa Rican people's support for the Cuban revolution is almost unanimous."

Thousands of letters expressing support for Cuba were sent to the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of the Organization of American States. The six thousand banana workers of the United Fruit Company of America demanded that the foreign ministers take measures to stop US interference in the affairs belonging to the Cuban government and the Cuban people.

The Banana Workers' Union is also preparing to launch demonstrations against US plots to interfere in Cuba in various banana plantations.

In order to express support for Cuban Foreign Minister Roa's condemnation of the United States, enthusiastic middle school students released balloons with large Cuban flags and slogans of "Long Live the Cuban Revolution," which floated from the east to the west of the capital. University students also hung Cuban flags on electric wires throughout the city, and women distributed pamphlets of "Cuba Has Reasons" on the main streets.

Xinhua News Agency, August 25th. San José dispatch: The Costa Rican Cuba Revolution Friendship Association held a gathering on the evening of the 23rd to welcome Cuban journalists who participated in the coverage of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of the Organization of American States.

Costa Rican women representatives participating in the gathering excitedly embraced Cuban journalists. Women of this country had transfused their blood to Cuban rebel army wounded soldiers when the Batista dictatorship in Cuba collapsed. At the meeting, Costa Rican mothers said: We transfuse blood to Cuban youths, which makes Cuba and Costa Rica forever united.

After the meeting, a demonstration was held, and the parade went to the statue of Cuban national hero Maceo and laid wreaths. Costa Rican female writer Virginia Grutter recited a poem praising the Cuban revolution.

Yesterday morning, women with Cuban flags hanging on their chests distributed leaflets supporting Cuba on the streets of San José. Costa Rican workers, farmers and intellectuals sent thousands of telegrams to the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, expressing their support for the Cuban people's right to freely decide their international relations with friendly countries. Most of the telegrams came from the banana area on the Pacific coast where the United Fruit Company of America plantation is located.

Xinhua News Agency, Bogotá, August 26th. The Colombian "Democratic Voice" published a commentary on the US plot to plan interference in Cuba through the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of the Organization of American States, saying: "The jurisprudence of the so-called American regional system is a mask, which cannot hide the claws of the American aggressors who plundered Mexico, Panama, Nicaragua and Puerto Rico, and the dollar diplomacy planners who funded the bloodiest tyranny in Venezuela, Cuba, Colombia and many other countries.”

The commentary pointed out that, unfortunately for the US imperialists, the treacherous behavior of the US tool, the Organization of American States, has been clearly seen by the people of Latin American countries. The newspaper said that the Cuban people's right to self-determination is inalienable, and the people of Latin American countries will never tolerate any act that undermines Cuba's right to self-determination. The US excuse of the so-called "threat from outside the continent" is actually just a despicable propaganda tactic by US imperialists.

The commentary said that now it is not so easy for US imperialism to invade Cuba, for a simple reason: the Cuban people, united as one, are determined to take up arms to defend the independence of their motherland. In addition, the Cuban people also have the support of all the people of Latin America, who regard the Cuban cause as their own cause.

    古巴公众舆论评美洲国家外长会议
    美帝国主义落到了被告者的地位
    哥斯达黎加人民支持古巴外长对赫脱的谴责
    哥伦比亚“民主呼声报”说泛美体系掩盖不住美国侵略魔爪
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　古巴“今日报”今天就美洲国家组织外长会议发表社论说，想在哥斯达黎加外长会议上充当原告角色的美帝国主义落到了被告者的地位，它遭到了世界舆论的谴责。
    报纸指出，企图包围古巴的人的立场很明显，一切诡辩都已经破产。美帝国主义对拉丁美洲的侵略和剥削的真面目已经暴露在世界舆论的面前。
    “今日报”在谈到拉丁美洲国家在外长会议上的态度时说，当一个国家的人民决心实现“誓死保卫祖国”的伟大口号时，它的朋友们也应该负起应负的责任。
      “街道报”发表的评论指出，我们斗争的经验证明，一个小的国家只要内部团结，就能够抵抗反对它的强大利益集团。报纸指出，一个弱小民族反对一个像美国这样的强国，对华尔街、五角大楼和白宫这个“神圣”的庞然大物毫无畏惧，这意味着事情不仅在古巴发生了变化，而且也在全世界发生着决定性的变化。
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　美国政府对目前正在古巴马埃斯特腊山区帮助古巴人民建设学校城的国际劳动队所进行的无耻诬蔑，今天被这里的有关人士斥之为彻头彻尾的捏造。这些人士指出，美国散布这种无耻谎言，其目的是为美国干涉古巴制造借口。
    8月22日，以国务卿赫脱为首的美国代表团向美洲国家组织成员国外长会议提出一项文件，把这个国际劳动队参加建设学校城的工作诬蔑为替“共产党特务和游击队制订训练计划，以便把共产主义革命蔓延到整个拉丁美洲”。
    据有关当局人士说，实际情况是，参加这个劳动队的来自各国的青年正在卡米洛·西恩富戈斯学校城建设美丽的花园。这些青年来自包括拉丁美洲国家和美国在内的三十八个国家，他们是应古巴起义军青年联合会通过世界民主青年联盟向他们发出的邀请前来古巴的。在他们中有模范工人、农民、学生和技术人员。
    美国政府对国际劳动队的诽谤激起此间公众的强烈愤怒。起义军青年联合会领袖霍埃尔·伊格莱西亚斯少校今天对记者说，“他们恨我们，因为我们正在过去属于封建大庄园主的贫困地区建设教育中心。”伊格莱西亚斯少校说，“我们将不顾美国的疯狂反对，继续我们的建设，国际劳动队将继续劳动下去。”他援引卡斯特罗总理的话说，如果敌人胆敢侵犯古巴，“我们将不惜我们的生命来保卫我们的每一寸土地”。
    起义军青年联合会已经打电报给赫脱，谴责美国的诽谤。
    古巴社会主义青年联盟全国委员会向报界发表书面声明，表示感谢参加国际劳动队的世界各国青年给予古巴的援助。声明警告赫脱说，如果美帝国主义胆敢对古巴发动侵略，它将被全世界团结一致的力量所击败。
    新华社27日讯　圣约瑟消息：古巴外交部长罗亚25日在美洲国家组织外长会议上谴责美国侵略古巴的发言，得到会议所在地哥斯达黎加首都圣约瑟人民的热烈支持。舆论认为，古巴外长罗亚关于谴责美国的发言，是对侵略拉丁美洲的帝国主义的最震动人心的谴责。哥斯达黎加“前进报”26日在显著地位以“崇高和英勇的古巴：全世界同你站在一起”的大字标题刊载了有关消息。
    哥斯达黎加总工会几乎在所有的工厂、车间和生产单位举行了工人大会，通过了要求尊重古巴的主权和谴责帝国主义侵略的决议。工会领导人贡萨洛·西埃拉说，“哥斯达黎加人民对古巴革命的支持几乎是一致的。”
    成千上万封表示支持古巴的信件寄到美洲国家组织外长会议。美国联合果品公司的六千名香蕉工人要求外长们采取措施，制止美国干涉属于古巴政府和古巴人民的事务。
    香蕉工人联合会还准备在各香蕉种植园开展反对美国阴谋干涉古巴的示威活动。
    为了表示支持古巴外长罗亚对美国的谴责，热情的中学生们放出了带有大幅古巴国旗和“古巴革命万岁”标语的气球，这些气球从首都的东部一直飘到西部。大学生们还把古巴的国旗挂在城市各地的电线上，妇女们在各主要街道上散发“古巴有理由”的小册子。
    新华社25日讯　圣约瑟消息：哥斯达黎加古巴革命之友协会23日晚间举行集会，欢迎参加美洲国家组织成员国外长会议报道工作的古巴记者。
    参加集会的哥斯达黎加妇女代表激动地拥抱古巴记者，这个国家的妇女在古巴巴蒂斯塔独裁政权倒台的时候，曾经把她们的鲜血输送给古巴起义军伤员。会上，哥斯达黎加的母亲们说：我们把鲜血输送给古巴青年，这使古巴和哥斯达黎加永远地团结在一起。
    会后举行了示威游行，游行队伍到古巴民族英雄马塞奥塑像前献了花圈。哥斯达黎加女作家比尔希尼亚·格鲁铁尔朗诵了一首赞扬古巴革命的诗。
    昨天早晨，胸前挂着古巴国旗的妇女在圣约瑟大街上散发了支持古巴的传单。哥斯达黎加工人、农民和知识分子把数以千计的电报发给外长会议，表示支持古巴人民自由决定他们同友好的国家保持国际关系的权利。电报大多数来自美国联合果品公司种植园所在地的太平洋沿岸的香蕉区。
    新华社波哥大26日电　哥伦比亚“民主呼声报”就美国通过美洲国家组织外长会议策划干涉古巴的阴谋这件事发表评论说：“名目繁多的所谓美洲区域体系的法律学是一个假面具，这个假面具并没有能掩盖住掠夺墨西哥、巴拿马、尼加拉瓜和波多黎各的美国侵略者以及资助过委内瑞拉、古巴、哥伦比亚和其它许多国家最血腥的暴政的美元外交策划者的魔爪。”
    评论指出，对美帝国主义者不幸的是：美国的工具美洲国家组织的叛变行为已经被拉丁美洲各国人民看得清清楚楚。这家报纸说，古巴人民的自决权是不可割让的，拉丁美洲各国人民永远不会容忍损害古巴自决权的行为，美国提出的所谓“来自大陆以外的威胁”的借口，实际上只不过是美帝国主义者进行宣传的一种卑劣手法。
    评论说，现在，美帝国主义要侵略古巴并不是那末容易的，理由很简单：团结得像一个人的古巴人民决心拿起武器保卫他们祖国的独立，此外，古巴人民还拥有把古巴的事业看作是自己的事业的拉丁美洲全体人民的支持。
