    Diligently Serve Agriculture
    Ye Shuchu
    Li Tinghui, the deputy director of the Nanshan Store in Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, and a Communist Party member, diligently serves agriculture and has become a model for financial and trade cadres in the Shantou area supporting agriculture. Last year, the Nanshan Commune decided to produce its own indigenous fertilizer. The commune Party committee decided that Li Tinghui should go to the Shangliao Brigade to conduct a pilot project. He and team cadre Yang Jiyou, after many experiments, successively produced eighteen kinds of indigenous fertilizers such as potassium-magnesium fertilizer. Then, they selected a sweet potato field and a seedling field to conduct experiments, allowing the commune members to see the benefits of using indigenous fertilizer with their own eyes. In this way, under the leadership of the Party Branch, Shangliao Brigade quickly launched a mass movement to produce indigenous fertilizer, producing more than 1,500 dan of indigenous fertilizer.

    As long as it is something needed for production, Li Tinghui will do it painstakingly. In 1958, agricultural production urgently needed a batch of farm tools and fertilizers. The store's inventory was insufficient. He did not sit in the store waiting for goods and talking about difficulties like some cadres, but actively purchased them. He spent fourteen days, traveled across two provinces and seven counties, covering two thousand li. Among them, he traveled more than 1,600 li by bicycle alone. Sometimes there were heavy winds and rain on the way, and the slippery mountain roads were difficult to walk on, but he carried his bicycle on his shoulders. After hard work, he finally purchased the planned farm tools and fertilizers.

    "Giving convenience to others is one's greatest happiness." Li Tinghui has such a noble communist style. Once, the Qiankeng Store came to contact him to buy bamboo raincoats, but the store's inventory had already been sold out. In order to meet the other party's requirements, Li Tinghui ran to the processing factory to mobilize workers to rush to make a batch. He and a dozen employees, at three o'clock in the morning, stepped on the muddy road and delivered three hundred bamboo raincoats to the Qiankeng Store twenty-five li away.

    Of course, things like this are not just one. A letter of thanks from the Nanshan Agricultural Machinery Factory to the store reads: On June 20, our furnace was about to stop firing due to insufficient fuel; but unexpectedly, Comrade Li Tinghui from your store transported eight hundred jin of charcoal to us from thirty li away....

    勤勤恳恳为农业
    叶树初
    广东揭阳县南山商店副主任、共产党员李廷辉，勤勤恳恳为农业服务，成为汕头专区财贸干部支援农业的一个标兵。去年，南山公社决定自制土化肥。公社党委决定李廷辉深入到上寮大队去搞试点。他和队干部杨继有经过多次试验，先后制出了钾镁肥等十八种土制化肥。接着，他们又选择一块番薯地和一块秧苗地进行试验，让社员亲眼看到使用土化肥的好处。这样，上寮大队在党总支的领导下，很快就掀起了大造土化肥的群众运动，制出土化肥一千五百多担。
    只要是生产需要的事，李廷辉就不避艰辛地去做好。1958年，农业生产急需要一批农具和化肥。店里库存的货源不足。他不是像有的干部那样，坐在店里等货，对人讲困难，而是积极采购。他花了十四天时间，跑过二个省、七个县，纵横两千华里，其中，单骑自行车就走了一千六百多里。有时途中风雨大作，滑溜溜的山路，连步行也很吃力，他却把自行车扛在肩上走。经过艰苦的工作，他终于把计划采购的农具和肥料采购回来。
    “把方便送给别人，就是自己最大的幸福。”李廷辉具有这么一种高贵的共产主义风格。有一回，钱坑商店前来联系买竹蓑衣，店里的存货已经售完。为了满足对方的要求，李廷辉跑到加工厂去动员工人赶制一批。他和十几个职工，在深夜三点钟，踏着泥泞的道路，将三百件竹蓑衣送到二十五里外的钱坑商店。
    像这样的事，当然不止一件。南山农业机械厂给商店的一封感谢信中，曾这样写着：6月20日，由于燃料不足，我们的锻炉眼看就要停火了；可是想不到，你店李廷辉同志却从三十里外给我们运来了八百斤木炭……。
