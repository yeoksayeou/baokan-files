Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 23rd: Vientiane Radio broadcast tonight a statement signed by Captain Kong Le in his capacity as Deputy Commander of the Royal Lao Army, condemning the plots of warlords and politicians to overthrow the new government, and stating that all Lao people will do their utmost to stop their conspiracy.

The statement said that the coup had achieved good results and met the wishes of the coup committee and the people. However, provocations and sabotage against peace still exist, which violate the wishes of the Lao people.

The statement pointed out, "For the past ten years, the Lao people have suffered greatly from pain and poverty, and they can no longer endure it, which is why this coup broke out." The statement said, "If anyone dares to oppose peace, all Lao people will unite and fight in various forms to stop them. The Lao people yearn for peace, and their most basic requirement is to be safe and sound, so that their children can go to school and receive care when they are sick, to ensure the continued survival of the Lao nation."

The statement said, "For the Lao people, if they have the right to freedom, they will choose a government that meets their wishes. This government must pursue a neutral policy, establish friendly relations with all countries, not be enemies with any country, not be related to any military blocs, and establish trade relations and cultural exchanges with various countries."

The statement said, "Currently, our people have established a government that meets their own wishes and support this government in all aspects. Some generals and some dirty politicians who were in power before the coup are currently carrying out a conspiracy to cancel the wishes of the people of the whole country, restore their system of enslavement, and instigate the army and people who originally loved peace to support their shameless deeds. But all the Lao people will do their best to stop their conspiracy."

The statement said, "The Lao people and army have always taken a tolerant attitude towards their behavior. The Lao people and army did this because they do not want the Lao people to kill each other, do not want bloodshed, and they also hope that these problems can be resolved peacefully so that peace will not be affected"; "However, some generals and politicians are bent on undermining peace, which will make the army and the people unbearable."

According to Agence France-Presse, Captain Kong Le read a statement at the airport on the morning of the 23rd, when Souvanna Phouma flew from Vientiane to Savannakhet to meet with Phoumi Nosavan, accusing Phoumi Nosavan's army of attacking Vientiane via Thailand. He warned that this action "will have serious consequences from both a domestic and international point of view."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 24th: Vientiane Radio published a commentary on the evening of the 23rd, condemning Phoumi Nosavan for breaking his promise and sending troops to occupy Beishan and Sanakham. The commentary said that according to the agreement reached between the government and General Phoumi Nosavan on August 20, neither side should mobilize troops to places close to each other to avoid conflict. However, Phoumi Nosavan violated this guarantee and sent troops to occupy Beishan and Sanakham. The commentary said that according to reliable sources, these troops came in via Thailand.

The commentary said, "If the above-mentioned troops take abnormal actions, we are ready to shed our blood at any time to fight against all the conspiracies of the Phoumi Nosavan group's blatant violation of the agreement, in order to defend the peace and order of the people of the whole country."

On the same night, Vientiane Radio broadcast a letter from officers and soldiers of the Kingdom Army in Vientiane to officers and soldiers in various military regions, calling on them to oppose Phoumi Nosavan.

The letter said that Phoumi Nosavan sent troops for his personal fame, fortune and status. "He has only one purpose, which is to create mutual killings between the Lao people and to destroy the Lao people."

The letter called on officers and soldiers in various military regions to take the road of resolutely not executing Phoumi Nosavan's orders for the sake of national harmony, for the common happiness, and for making Lao's independence forever consolidated, "do not shoot at Lao troops, but oppose Phoumi Nosavan." The letter called on everyone to unite to avoid bloodshed and useless death. The letter said, "You must see clearly that Phoumi Nosavan, who ordered you to kill each other, did not go with you, and those who are selling their lives for him are only you."

    老挝王国军队副总司令贡勒发表声明
    老挝人民将全力制止颠复新政府的阴谋
    万象王国军队官兵号召各军区官兵反对诺萨万制造内战的命令
    新华社河内23日电　万象电台今晚广播贡勒大尉以老挝王国军队副总司令名义签署的一篇声明，谴责军阀和政客企图颠复新政府的阴谋活动，表示全体老挝人民将全力以赴以制止他们的阴谋。
    声明说，这次政变已经取得良好的结果，并满足了政变委员会和人民的愿望。但是，对安宁的挑衅和破坏仍然存在，它违背了老挝人民的愿望。
    声明指出，“过去十年来，老挝人民饱受了痛苦和贫困，他们再也不能忍受了，所以才爆发这次政变。”声明说，“如果有人敢于反对安宁，全体老挝人民将会一致起来以各种形式进行斗争，来制止他们。老挝人民渴望安宁，他们最起码的要求是能够平安无事，好让孩子们能够上学，生病时得到照顾，以保证老挝民族继续生存。”
    声明说，“对老挝人民来说，如果他们具有自由权利的话，他们将会选择符合他们愿望的政府。这个政府必须奉行中立政策，同所有国家建立友好关系，不同任何国家结仇，不同任何军事集团发生关系，同各国建立贸易关系和互相进行文化交流。”
    声明说，“目前，我国人民成立了符合自己愿望的政府，并从各个方面支持这个政府。在政变前掌握政权的某些将领和某些肮脏的政客们目前正在进行一项阴谋，就是企图取消全国人民的愿望，恢复他们的奴役制度，唆使本来是热爱安宁的军队和人民支持他们的无耻勾当。但是全体老挝人民将全力以赴地制止他们的阴谋。”
    声明说，“老挝人民和军队对他们的这种行为一直采取忍耐的态度。老挝人民和军队所以这样做，是因为他们不希望老挝人互相残杀，不希望发生流血，他们还希望这些问题能够加以和平解决，以使安宁不致受到影响”；“但是，某些将领和政客们却一味破坏安宁，这将会使得军队和人民忍无可忍”。
    另据法新社报道，贡勒大尉23日上午在富马飞离万象前往沙湾拿吉同诺萨万会谈时，曾在机场宣读一项声明，指责诺萨万军队经由泰国进攻万象。他警告说，这种行动
  “从国内观点和国际观点来看都将产生严重的后果”。
    据新华社河内24日电　万象电台23日晚上发表评论，谴责富米·诺萨万背信弃义，派军队占领北汕和沙那堪。评论说，根据政府和富米·诺萨万将军8月20日达成的协议，双方不得调集军队到互相接近的地方，以避免冲突。但是，富米·诺萨万违背了这个保证，派军队占领北汕和沙那堪。评论说，据确实的消息说，这些军队是取道泰国进来的。
    评论说，“如果上述军队采取非正常的行动，我们就随时准备洒尽自己的鲜血，为反对富米·诺萨万集团的明目张胆的违背协议的一切阴谋而战斗，以保卫全国人民的安宁和秩序。”
    同一天晚上，万象电台广播了万象的王国军队官兵致各军区官兵的一封信，号召他们反对富米·诺萨万。
    这封信说，富米·诺萨万出兵是为了他个人的名利和地位。“他只有一个目的，就是制造老挝人之间的互相残杀，使老挝人灭亡。”
    信中号召各军区官兵为了民族的和睦，为了共同的幸福，为了使老挝的独立永远巩固，走坚决不执行富米·诺萨万的命令的道路，“不要向老挝部队开枪，而要反对富米·诺萨万”。信中号召大家团结起来，以避免流血和无益的死亡。这封信说，“你们要看清，命令你们去互相残杀的富米·诺萨万并没有同你们一起去，而为他卖命的只是你们。”
