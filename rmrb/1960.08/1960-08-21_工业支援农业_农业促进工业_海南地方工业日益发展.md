　　Hainan's Local Industry is Developing Rapidly

　　(Our dispatch) Under the impetus of the great development of agricultural production, the local industry of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is growing rapidly. At present, the entire prefecture has eleven industrial sectors, including electricity, fuel, machinery, chemicals, building materials, leather making, sugar making, and flour milling, as well as fifty-two large and small mines run by the county or above. The technical level and mechanization of factories and mines have also improved rapidly. According to a survey conducted at the end of June this year, the average level of mechanization in factories and mines across the prefecture has increased rapidly from 2.4% in April to 14%. The mechanization level of agricultural and pastoral machinery industrial enterprises directly serving agriculture has reached over 20%.
　　
　　Developing from nothing and growing from small to large are significant characteristics of the development of local industry in the autonomous prefecture. Before liberation, the entire prefecture had only three extremely scattered handicraft industries – iron, wood, boots and shoes – in individual counties. After liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, thanks to the firm implementation by Party organizations at all levels of the general line of developing industrial production in a way that combines large, medium and small industries, both indigenous and foreign methods, and other “walking on two legs” policies, based on the principles of adapting to local conditions, making do with whatever is available, and using local materials, a large number of factories have sprung up like mushrooms. At present, most people's communes have commune-run industries such as agricultural and pastoral machinery repair and manufacturing, pesticides and fertilizers, general building materials, as well as leather making, sewing, woodwork, and processing of agricultural, pastoral, and local specialty products. The output value of factories and mines run by the county level or above has increased ninefold compared to 1957 before the Great Leap Forward. In Qabqa, the capital of the autonomous prefecture, many factories have been built one after another on many barren beaches. Now there are more than a dozen factories, including power generation, flour milling, leather, chemicals, agricultural and pastoral machinery, and veterinary drugs, and many factories have some modern equipment. New products are increasing and the total production value is increasing year by year. In the first half of this year, the total industrial output value of the entire prefecture increased by two times compared with the same period last year.

　　Industry develops by supporting agriculture, which is another characteristic of industrial development in the autonomous prefecture. At present, a rudimentary agricultural and pastoral machinery repair and manufacturing network has been formed throughout the prefecture. With the specific help of many factories and mines, many production teams have their own agricultural implement repair groups. In order to ensure agricultural development this year, the industrial departments of the entire prefecture first broke the self-deprecating idea that only some simple agricultural tools such as iron shovels, pickaxes, and hoes could be produced locally, gave full play to the communist style of daring to think and act, and adopted the methods of self-reliance, using local materials, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. According to the need for “agricultural implement production to take a step ahead of the agricultural season,” they actively arranged the production of various animal-powered agricultural tools such as mountain plows, seven-inch plows, and horse-drawn seeders since the autumn harvest last year. Now, not only can various small agricultural tools such as iron shovels, hoes, plowshares, hand hoes, and hand shovels be basically self-sufficient, but also various plows, harvesters, hay rakes, threshers, as well as transportation tools such as large flatbed carts and carriages, can be produced and manufactured locally. In order to give full play to the use efficiency of existing agricultural tools, many factories have also incorporated agricultural tool repair into their production plans. In addition to ensuring repairs as soon as they arrive without delaying agricultural time, agricultural and pastoral machinery factories and agricultural tool repair factories at all levels have also organized mobile repair groups to go deep into communes and fields to carry out repairs in a timely manner. While ensuring the completion of various production tasks, the broad masses of workers have also actively helped various communes and production teams to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, create and modify various tools, and improve production efficiency. The Gonghe County Agricultural and Pastoral Machinery Factory, overcoming various difficulties under the conditions of simple equipment and weak technical force, has successfully trial-produced a simple harvester that saves steel, is lightweight, and can be pulled by only one donkey after many experiments, which improves work efficiency by fifteen times compared with manual harvesting.

    工业支援农业　农业促进工业
    海南地方工业日益发展
    本报讯　在农业生产大发展的推动下，海南藏族自治州地方工业成长很快。目前，全州已有电力、燃料、机械、化学、建筑材料、制革、制糖、面粉等十一个工业部门，县营以上的大、小矿五十二个。厂矿技术水平和机械化程度也提高很快。根据今年6月底的调查统计，全州各厂矿的机械化程度平均已由4月间的2.4％提高到14％，直接为农业服务的农牧机械工业企业的机械化程度已达20％以上。
    从无到有，从小到大，是自治州地方工业发展中的一个显著特点。解放前，全州只在个别县有铁、木、靴鞋等三个极其分散的手工业行业。解放后，特别是在1958年大跃进以来，由于各级党组织根据因地制宜、因陋就简、就地取材的原则，坚决贯彻执行了大中小相结合、土洋并举等一整套“两条腿走路”的发展工业生产的方针，大批工厂如雨后春笋般地兴建起来。目前，极大部分人民公社都有了农牧机具修配制造、农药化肥、一般建筑材料以及制革、缝纫、木器、农牧土特产品加工等社办工业。全州仅县营以上的厂矿企业产值即比大跃进以前的1957年增加了九倍。在自治州首府恰卜恰的许多荒滩上，新建厂矿更是接踵而起，现在已有发电、面粉、皮革、化工、农牧机械、畜用药物等十几个工厂，不少工厂还有了一些现代化设备。新产品越来越多，生产总值逐年增长。今年上半年全州工业总产值又比去年同期增长了两倍。
    工业在支援农业中发展起来，这是自治州工业发展的另一特点。目前，一个初具规模的农牧机具修配制造网已在全州范围形成。在许多厂矿的具体帮助下，不少生产队都有了自己的农具修配组。为了保证今年农业发展，全州工业部门首先打破了认为当地只能生产一些铁铣、洋镐、镢头等简单农具的自卑思想，充分发挥了敢想、敢做的共产主义风格，采取自力更生、就地取材、土洋并举的办法，根据“农具生产比农事季节先走一步”的需要，从去年秋收以后，就积极安排了山地步犁、七寸步犁、马拉播种机等各种畜力农具的生产。现在，不但像铁铣、镢头、犁铧、手锄、手铲等各种小农具已经做到基本自给，各种步犁、收割机、耧草机、脱谷机以及大板车、架子车等运输工具，也可以就地生产制造。为了充分发挥原有农具的使用效率，许多工厂并把农具修配纳入了自己的生产计划，除了保证随到随修、不误农时外，各级农牧机械厂和农具修配厂还组织巡回修配组，深入公社、田间及时进行修配。在保证完成各项生产任务的同时，广大职工还积极帮助各地公社和生产队大搞技术革新和技术革命，创制和改制各种工具，提高生产工效。共和县农牧机械厂在设备简陋、技术力量薄弱的情况下，克服种种困难，经过多次试验，试制成功一种省钢材、又轻便，只要一头毛驴就可以拉动的简易收割机，比手工收割提高工效十五倍。
