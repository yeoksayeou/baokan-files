Xinhua News Agency: After winning the victory of "more transport during floods" in the first half of the year, the water transport workers of Jiangxi Province are seizing a new victory of "more transport during the dry season". In the first month of the dry season (July), the average daily freight volume of professional tugboats in the province remained at a high production level of over 20,000 tons, an increase of two and a half times compared with the average daily freight volume in the same period last year. Although there were strong winds for several consecutive days in early August, production indicators are still rising steadily. The freight volume in the last five days of this ten-day period increased by more than 20% compared to the first five days.

Since the beginning of summer, due to prolonged sunny weather and little rain, the water level on the inland river routes in Jiangxi Province has dropped. In order to ensure the completion of the transportation tasks of key materials during the dry season, shipping units at all levels in the province have established special teams for digging sand and raising ships, and quickly entered the beachheads of various routes to carry out rush transportation work during the dry season. Leading cadres at all levels went deep into the front line to fight alongside waterway workers and crew members. When Xiao Jiawan, the longest shoal in the middle reaches of the Gan River, was exposed, Wen Yinshan, the Party Branch Secretary of the Second Ship Brigade of the Provincial Shipping Bureau, personally took charge and led the crew members of the passing-shoal fleet and waterway workers to adopt the method of simultaneously digging sand, flushing sand, and lightering cargo to pass through the shoal. They worked day and night to carry out a crash breakthrough, enabling more than one hundred ships that were about to be blocked at the shoal to pass through quickly and safely.

    江西水运职工做到枯水多运
    新华社讯　江西省水运战线职工赢得上半年“洪水多运”的胜利之后，再夺“枯水多运”新胜利。在枯水季节的头一个月（7月份），全省专业轮驳船的平均日运货量仍然保持在二万吨以上的高产水平，比去年同期的平均日运量增长二倍半。8月上旬虽然连日大风，生产指标仍在步步上升。这一旬的后五天的货运量比头五天增长了20％以上。
    入夏以来，由于久晴少雨，江西省内河航线出现了水位枯落的现象。全省各级航运单位为了保证在枯水季节完成重点物资的运输任务，都建立了扒沙抬船的专门队伍，迅速进入各个航线的滩头阵地展开枯水期的抢运工作。各级领导干部纷纷深入第一线，同航道工人和船员一道共同奋战，当赣江中游滩头最长的肖家湾露头的时候，省航运局第二船舶大队党总支书记文银山亲自出马，带领过滩船队的船员同航道工人，采用边扒沙、边冲沙、边驳载过滩的办法，日夜突击强渡，使一百多艘眼看就要被堵塞在滩口的船只迅速安全通过。
