    Getting Grain from Woodlands, Achieving Bumper Harvests of Both Trees and Crops
    Hunan and Fujian Expand Area of Forest-Grain Intercropping

    Changsha Dispatch of this newspaper, 3rd -- By the end of July, Hunan Province's total area of forest-grain intercropping had reached 11.9 million mu, more than double that of last year, exceeding the annual plan.

    In Hunan Province, the method of forest-grain intercropping has been proven to be a very good one. Forty-nine mountainous counties that used to be short of grain across the province have achieved self-sufficiency or a surplus in grain through forest-grain intercropping and other reforms of the cropping system.

    This year, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has further affirmed forest-grain intercropping as a basic system for forestry production, and has issued production plans for it as an important measure to increase grain production. The area of forest-grain intercropping in various places has rapidly expanded. The Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has more than 940,000 mu of forest-grain intercropping this year, double that of last year. In Shouche Commune, Yongshun County, the average area of forest-grain intercropping land reaches about two mu per commune member. The Qianyang Special District gave full play to the superiority of the People's Communes, adopting methods of large-scale afforestation, large forests, comprehensive felling, comprehensive land reclamation, and comprehensive forest-grain intercropping. This year, the base for forest-grain intercropping rapidly increased to 118 places, of which 31 are over 100 mu.

    In order to avoid mutual influence between the sowing time of early rice and intercropped miscellaneous grains, all localities have tried their best to advance the sowing of intercropped miscellaneous grains before the transplanting of early rice. At the same time as strengthening rice field management, they have adopted methods of fixed professional teams and temporary crash efforts to strengthen the cultivation and management of forest-grain intercropping crops. At present, Shaoyang, Hengyang, and Xiangtan Special Districts and Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture have fixed more than 80,000 professional team members and more than 11,300 head of cattle to strengthen the cultivation and management of forest-grain intercropping. Xiangtan Special District also made use of the gap before the "Double Rush" (of harvesting early rice and planting late rice), mobilizing more than 50,000 laborers to universally carry out one to two times of inter-tillage and topdressing on more than 530,000 mu of forest-grain intercropping crops in the entire district.

    向林地要粮食  让林木庄稼齐丰收
    湖南福建林粮间作面积扩大
    本报长沙3日电　湖南省到7月底止，全省林粮间作面积已达一千一百九十万亩，比去年增加一倍以上，超额完成全年计划。
    林粮间作的办法，已在湖南省被证明是一个很好的办法。全省有四十九个过去缺粮的山区县，经过林粮间作和其他耕作制度的改革，已作到粮食自给或有余。
    今年，中共湖南省委进一步把林粮间作作为林业生产的基本制度肯定下来，并作为增产粮食的一项重要措施，下达了生产计划。各地林粮间作面积迅速扩大。湘西土家族苗族自治州今年林粮间作九十四万多亩，比去年增加了一倍。永顺县首车公社林粮间作土地平均每个社员达到二亩左右。黔阳专区充分发挥人民公社的优越性，采取了大造林、造大林，成片采伐、成片开垦、成片搞林粮间作的办法，今年林粮间作的基地迅速增加到一百一十八处，其中一百亩以上的达三十一处。
    为了避免早稻和间作杂粮在播种时间上相互影响，各地都尽可能把林粮间作的杂粮播种提早在早稻插秧前结束。并且在加强稻田管理的同时，采取固定专业队和临时突击的办法，加强林粮间作作物的培育管理。现在，邵阳、衡阳、湘潭专区和湘西土家族苗族自治州已固定了八万多专业队员、一万一千三百多条耕牛加强林粮间作的培育管理工作。湘潭专区还利用“双抢”前的空隙，出动了五万多劳力，对全区五十三万多亩林粮间作作物普遍进行了一到二次中耕追肥。
