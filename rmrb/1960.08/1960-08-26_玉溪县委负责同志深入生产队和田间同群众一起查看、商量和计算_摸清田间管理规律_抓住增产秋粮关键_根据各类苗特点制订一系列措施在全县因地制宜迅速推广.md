According to Yunnan Daily: How much potential is there for increasing production through later-stage field management? From which aspects should we tap this potential? What links and measures should we focus on? These are the questions Yuqi County encountered during the later stage of field management and promptly and correctly resolved.

Strengthening later-stage field management can increase production: The potential of first-class seedlings is not small, second-class seedlings have great potential, and third-class seedlings have unlimited prospects.

In order to seriously solve the above problems, the responsible comrades of the Yuqi County Party Committee went deep into the Songguan Management Area of the Yanhe Commune, and, together with the cadres of the management area, selected Team Ten, which was representative in all aspects of natural conditions, for serious investigation and research, and specific analysis. As soon as they arrived at the production team, they consulted with cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians, and went to the site for inspection. The team's 125 mu of rice was inspected and ranked. The results showed that 80 mu were first-class seedlings, which have already headed; 30 mu were second-class seedlings, which are beginning to round their stalks and become pregnant; and 15 mu were third-class seedlings, which are still in the tillering stage. Everyone analyzed that the first and second-class seedlings are now at a crucial time to promote large ears and many grains; the third-class seedlings generally have a lot of weeds, lack fertilizer, lack water, and have long embankment grass, which is also a crucial time to focus on management and promote more tillering. "Seedlings rush for Xiaoman [a solar term], grain rushes for autumn, focus your energy on the crucial moment;" now, for the first-class seedlings, remove all weeds, cut all embankment grass, irrigate with three to four inches of water, and apply another 100 jin of ash fertilizer as foliar fertilizer, and do a good job in "five preventions" (preventing rats, sparrows, floods, lodging, and trampling by cattle and livestock), each mu can still harvest more than 110 jin of grain; for the second-class seedlings, remove all weeds and barnyard grass, cut all embankment grass, irrigate with two to three inches of water, apply 1,000 jin of medium fertilizer per mu, and 100 jin of ash fertilizer as foliar fertilizer, plus the "five preventions", each mu can still harvest more than 130 jin of grain; for the third-class seedlings, remove all weeds, increase the application of 2,000 jin of heat-generating fertilizer and 200 jin of ash fertilizer per mu, manage the seedling water well, and dry the fields well, and each mu can still harvest more than 200 jin of grain. Everyone further saw that as long as these measures are specifically implemented, the potential for increasing production of first-class seedlings is not small, the potential for second-class seedlings is great, and the prospects for third-class seedlings are unlimited. With a solution, everyone was even more enthusiastic and determined. The entire management area proposed the slogan of "three lights" (weeds light, barnyard grass light, embankment grass light) and "three haves" (have water, have fertilizer, have people to manage) for rice, and "four no's" (no standing water in ditches, no smoke flowers on top, no weeds in the topsoil, no yellow leaves at the bottom) and "three haves" (have fertilizer, have fuel, have people to manage) for flue-cured tobacco, and immediately organized action, quickly accumulating more than 10 million jin of green manure and clearing out 15 million jin of human and animal manure, ensuring the need for topdressing.

Carefully study the late growth patterns of crops and past experience, and take appropriate measures to strive for greater production increases.

Through the practice of this management area, the county party committee understood the basis of late-stage management, and based on the experience of this management area, deployed the late-stage field management work of the entire county. The area of ​​first and second-class seedlings in the county accounts for more than 85% of the total rice area, which is the main reliance for increasing autumn production. At the same time, all localities have paid more attention to the problem of managing third-class seedlings and have taken some measures. Therefore, the county party committee regarded the good management of first and second-class seedlings as the key to late-stage field management, while not neglecting the management of third-class seedlings. All four secretaries and seventeen members of the county party committee, except for one standing committee member left at home, went deep into the production teams, participated in production and led production, vigorously grasped late-stage field management, and paid attention to summarizing and promoting the experience of key teams. Under the leadership of the county party committee, leaders at all levels in the county went to the forefront of production, regarding the team as their home, providing specific assistance and specific leadership, greatly encouraging the labor enthusiasm of the masses, and launching a vigorous and solid overproduction campaign.

After the Yuqi County Party Committee clarified the basis for striving for increased autumn grain production by going deep into one team, it formulated some unified measures to strengthen late-stage field management, and at the same time required all localities to formulate specific measures according to local conditions. At present, judging from most areas of the county, the growth conditions and seasons of first and second-class seedlings are similar to those of the Songguan Management Area. Most of the first-class seedlings have begun to head, and applying nitrogen fertilizer again will not work. Now, it is most necessary to strengthen management and management in two aspects: one is to vigorously promote ear-to-ear heading and grain-to-grain plumpness; the other is to prevent late-stage diseases and pests such as rice blast, false smut, lodging, and birds. According to past experience, there are some shriveled grains on the top of rice ears, especially on the top of the two-branched ears, which are mostly empty shells. This is the result of insufficient late-stage management; there are also many late-stage rice diseases and pests, and mismanagement will cause losses. For example, some fields look the best and have the least yield. This is the reason. Based on these experiences, the unified measures stipulated in principle throughout the county are also divided into two aspects: one aspect is to promote large ears and plump grains, such as universally applying ash fertilizer once, removing barnyard grass while disturbing the rice flowers, frequently managing field water, and drying the field water at the appropriate time; the other aspect is specifically to deal with various late-stage diseases and pests. The county implements "five preventions", and the communes and teams have established "five prevention" groups, universally inspected, cleared embankment grass, and organized semi-labor to drive away sparrows at the edge of the fields. The second-class seedlings are now in the budding and pregnant stage. In addition to implementing the management measures for first-class seedlings in a timely manner, it is also necessary to apply a pregnant ear fertilizer at this time to vigorously promote large ears and many grains, frequently release seedling water, and maintain deep irrigation. After the measures were formulated, the communes immediately took action, organizing labor to send fertilizer to the fields. For example, each team in Jiuxi Commune fixed more than 300 ox and horse carts, 27 pack horses, and 19 pack cattle to transport manure; each team fixed two or three people to manage seedling water.

Hand over the problem of reasonably arranging labor to the masses for joint discussion and resolution, and place strengthening the work of backward teams in an important position in the overproduction campaign.

In order to strengthen late-stage field management, Yuqi County concentrated all possible labor from all aspects to strengthen the forefront of production. Now, the labor force invested in agricultural production in the county accounts for more than 75% of the total labor force. However, after rice enters the late-stage management, the tasks increase and become more complicated, including management such as weeding, topdressing, and water management, as well as special late-stage management such as disease and pest prevention, lodging prevention, embankment grass removal, and flower removal. In addition to the management of food crops, the baking of flue-cured tobacco has also begun. Yuqi is one of the main tobacco producing areas, and tobacco requires a lot of labor. These changes in agricultural production tasks involve the question of how to arrange the labor force. The experience of Yuqi County in solving this problem is that the county party committee personally went deep into key production teams and handed over the problem to the masses to discuss and solve together. The first secretary of the county party committee went to the Seventh Production Team of the Haihu Management Area of the Dajie Commune to help them conduct a three-way ranking of tasks, labor, and crops, and a three-way matching of labor strength, task weight, and technical level, and implemented a combination of fixed professional groups and temporary concentrated attacks. After such an arrangement, the labor organization of the entire team basically adapted to the needs of the current production tasks. At the same time, the labor quotas were also appropriately adjusted according to the changes in the tasks. The county promoted the practice of this team, greatly promoting work efficiency and quality.

In the overproduction campaign to strengthen late-stage field management, among the more than 1,000 production teams in the county, 87 were in a backward state in production, accounting for about 8% of the total number of teams, and the cultivated area accounted for about 9.3% of the total cultivated area of ​​the county. Although they are a minority in the county, they have a significant impact on the county's efforts to win an autumn harvest. Therefore, the Yuqi County Party Committee placed the strengthening of the work of backward teams in an important position in the county's over-contract production campaign, organized a special force to analyze the reasons for backwardness one by one. The main measures to change the face of backward teams are to send capable cadres to provide specific assistance, and to mobilize advanced production teams to support them in terms of manpower and material resources. The county quickly launched a wave of enthusiasm for advanced teams to help backward teams and backward teams to catch up with advanced teams. From the county party committee to the management area branch, cadres were sent to the backward teams. A total of two county party committee secretaries, 18 commune party committee secretaries, 60 management area branch secretaries, and more than 60 general cadres were drawn and sent to the backward areas to help with their work; county and commune-level enterprises, agencies, and schools also organized more than 3,000 people to rush to help backward production teams with weeding and topdressing. The production of Teams Four, Six, and Eight of the Dongtian Management Area of ​​the Renjing Commune was relatively backward. There were 210 mu of autumn fields, accounting for 20% of the total rice area. The commune party committee sent a secretary to strengthen specific leadership and transferred 250 tons of chemical fertilizer to support them. The entire team adopted a three-in-one (barnyard manure, green manure, and chemical fertilizer) fertilization method to rush topdressing, and it has now received significant results. After strengthening the leadership force and carrying out a series of specific assistance, the production appearance of more than 80 backward teams in the county is rapidly changing.

    玉溪县委负责同志深入生产队和田间同群众一起查看、商量和计算
    摸清田间管理规律  抓住增产秋粮关键
    根据各类苗特点制订一系列措施在全县因地制宜迅速推广
    本报讯　据云南日报消息：后期田间管理的增产潜力还有多大？要从哪些方面去挖掘增产潜力？应当抓几个什么环节和哪些措施？这些是玉溪县在后期田间管理期间所遇到的、并且及时地加以正确解决的问题。
    加强后期田间管理就能增产：一类苗潜力
        不小，二类苗大有可为，三类苗前途无量
    为了认真解决以上问题，中共玉溪县委负责同志深入到研和公社宋官管理区，会同管理区的干部，选择了在自然条件的各个方面都有代表性的十队，认真调查研究，进行具体分析。他们一到生产队，就找干部、有经验的农民、技术员商量，并到现场查看。这个队的一百二十五亩稻谷，检查排队的结果，一类苗八十亩，现已出穗；二类苗三十亩，开始圆秆孕穗；三类苗十五亩还在分蘖阶段。大家分析，一、二类苗现在正是促进穗大粒多的时刻；三类苗普遍是田里草多、缺肥、水少、埂草长，也是狠抓加工、促进分蘖多的关键时刻。“秧奔小满谷奔秋，力气使在火候上”；现在，一类苗薅光杂草，割光埂草，灌三至四寸的水，再施一百斤灰肥作根外追肥，做好五防（防鼠、防雀、防洪、防倒伏、防牛马牲口糟踏），每亩还可能多收一百一十多斤谷子；二类苗拔光杂草、稗子、割光埂草、灌水二至三寸深，每亩施中等肥一千斤，根外施灰肥一百斤，加上“五防”，每亩还可能多收一百三十斤谷子；三类苗薅光杂草，每亩增施热性肥料二千斤、灰肥二百斤，管好苗水晒好田，每亩还可能多收两百斤谷子。大家进一步看到，只要具体实行这些措施，一类苗增产潜力不小，二类苗大有可为，三类苗前途无量。有了办法，大家劲头更足，决心更大，全管理区提出了稻谷“三光”（杂草光、稗子光、埂草光）、“三有”（有水、有肥、有人管），烤烟“四无”（沟无积水、顶无烟花、墒无杂草、脚无黄叶）、“三有”（有肥、有燃料、有人管）的加工口号，马上组织行动，很快就积了绿肥一千多万斤，清理出人畜粪肥一千五百万斤，保证了追肥的需要。
    细致研究作物后期生长规律和历年经验
        采取适当措施力争收到更大的增产效果
    县委通过这个管理区的实践，摸着了后期管理的底，并根据这个管理区的经验，部署了全县的后期田间管理工作。全县一、二类苗的面积，占水稻总面积的85％以上，是秋季增产的主要依靠，同时，加工三类苗的问题，各地已经比较重视，并且采取了一些措施，因此，县委把加工管理好一、二类苗列为后期田间管理的重点来抓，同时也不忽视三类苗的加工管理。县委四个书记十七个委员除留一个常委在家外，全部深入到生产队，参加生产领导生产，大抓后期田间管理，并注意总结推广重点队的经验。在县委带动下，全县各级领导都走上生产第一线，以队为家，具体帮助，具体领导，大大鼓舞群众的劳动热情，轰轰烈烈而又扎扎实实地开展了超产运动。
    玉溪县委通过深入一个队摸清了争取秋粮增产的底子以后，制定了一些加强后期田间管理的统一措施，同时要求各地因地制宜订出具体措施。目前，就全县大部分地区看，一、二类苗的成长情况和季节都和宋官管理区差不多。一类苗多数开始出穗，再追氮性肥料已不起作用，现在最需要从两方面加强加工管理：一是力促穗穗通顶，粒粒壮实；一是防治稻瘟、泡呛、倒伏、鸟雀等后期病害。据历年经验，稻穗上面都有一部分秕谷，特别是两个岔穗的顶部，多是空壳，这是后期加工不够的结果；水稻后期病害也很多，管理不到就会造成损失，如有些田看苗棵最好，论产量最少，就是这个道理。根据这些经验，全县从原则上规定的统一措施也分两方面：一方面是促使穗大粒饱的，如普遍施一次灰肥，拔一次稗子连带闯谷花，勤管田水，到适当时候就空干田水；另一方面的措施是专门对付各种后期病害的，全县实行“五防”，社社、队队成立“五防”小组，普遍检查，铲光埂草，组织半劳动力在田边赶雀。二类苗现在正当打苞孕穗的时候，除了适时实行一类苗的加工管理措施以外，当前还要施一次孕穗肥，力促穗大粒多，勤放苗水，保持深灌。措施订出以后，各公社立即行动起来，组织劳动力送肥下田，如九溪公社各队共固定了三百多辆牛马车、二十七匹驮马、十九匹驮牛送粪；队队固定了二、三人专管苗水。
    把合理安排劳力问题交给群众共同商量解决
        把加强后进队工作摆在超产运动的重要地位
    为了加强后期田间管理，玉溪县从各方面集中一切可能集中的劳动力，加强生产第一线。现在全县投入农业生产的劳动力已占劳动力总数的75％强。但是，水稻进入后期管理以后，活计增多而且复杂起来，既有薅草、追肥、管水等加工，又有防病害、防倒伏、铲埂草、赶花等后期的特殊管理。除了粮食作物加工管理外，烤烟的烘烤也开始了。玉溪是烤烟主要产区之一，烤烟需要不少的劳动力。农业生产活计的这些变化，牵连到如何安排劳动力的问题。玉溪县委解决这个问题的经验是，由县委亲自深入到重点生产队，把问题交给群众，一起商量解决。县委第一书记去的是大街公社海浒管理区第七生产队，帮助他们进行了活计、劳力、作物三排队，劳力强弱、活计轻重、技术性高低三对口，实行固定专业组和临时集中突击相结合的办法。这样经过一番安排，全队劳动力组织基本上适应了当前生产任务的需要。同时根据活计的变化，劳动定额也作了适当调整。全县都推广了这个队的做法，大大促进了工效和质量。
  在加强后期田间管理的超产运动中，全县一千多个生产队中，有八十七个在生产上处于后进状态，约占总队数的8％，耕地面积约占全县耕地面积的9.3％。它们在全县虽是少数，但是对全县争取秋季丰收却有重大的影响。因此，玉溪县委把加强后进队的工作放在全县超包产运动的重要地位来抓，组织了专门力量，逐个分析后进的原因。改变后进队面貌的主要措施是加派得力干部，进行具体帮助，并发动先进生产队从人力上物力上支援他们。全县迅速开展了一个先进帮后进、后进赶先进的热潮。从县委到管理区支部都为后进队输送了干部，全县一共抽出县委书记二人、公社党委书记十八人、管理区支部书记六十人、一般干部六十多人，派到后进地区去帮助工作；县、公社一级企业、机关和学校，还组织了三千多人，突击帮助后进生产队薅草、追肥。任井公社东田管理区的四队、六队、八队的生产都比较后进，共有二百一十亩坐秋田，占水稻总面积的20％，公社党委派了一个书记去加强具体领导，并调了二百五十吨化肥支援他们。全队采取三合一（厩肥、绿肥、化肥）的施肥法突击追肥，现在已收到明显的效果。全县八十多个后进队经过加强领导力量和进行了一系列具体帮助以后，生产面貌正在迅速改观。
