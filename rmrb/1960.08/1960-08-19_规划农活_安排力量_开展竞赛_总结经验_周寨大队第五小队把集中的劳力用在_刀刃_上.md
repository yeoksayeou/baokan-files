Xinhua News Agency report: After the Party Branch Secretary of the Jiangdian Commune Zhouzhai Brigade in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, went deep into the grassroots and helped the Fifth Team meticulously arrange the manpower concentrated on the front line, the team's current production is booming.

After initially studying the guiding ideology of taking agriculture as the foundation, the Fifth Team concentrated most of its labor on current agricultural production. However, after a large number of laborers were concentrated, labor management did not keep up, so efficiency and quality did not improve accordingly. Zhou Xianli, the brigade's Party branch secretary, went deep into this team, worked with the commune members, and discovered this problem. Poor peasant commune member Liu Yucang told him: "The team cadres have no plan, and the labor is not used on the cutting edge." Zhou Xianli raised these situations to the brigade Party branch meeting for research and analysis. Everyone believed that the emergence of this phenomenon was related to the lack of experience of the team cadres, so they decided to first help the leading cadres of this team solve the problem of labor arrangement.

Zhou Xianli and the team's leading cadres repeatedly studied the team's specific situation and current farm work, and found a reasonable method for arranging labor that included four items: "Planning," "Determining," "Competing," and "Summarizing."

"Planning" means planning farm work. The team cadres and work group leaders jointly researched and divided the current sixteen kinds of farm work into five categories according to their importance and urgency: first, hoeing five crops: cotton, corn, beans, peanuts, and sweet potatoes; second, cotton pruning and topping; third, topdressing; fourth, pest control; fifth, a fixed professional team accumulating fertilizer and weeding. According to the five major categories of farm work, they calculated the required labor, time, workdays, and animal power, and calculated that a total of 580 workdays were required according to quotas. This period of farm work was to be done in five days, and the 96 people participating in field labor could do 480 workdays, which was still 100 workdays short, so it was decided to solve this problem through reforming tools, carrying out collaborative support, and launching labor competitions.

"Determining" is to implement a responsibility system that determines labor, leadership, quantity, quality, time, and rewards and punishments. The team leader and deputy leader led ten commune members to personally try out the work, and revised the original quotas that were too high or too low. Then, the labor force was divided into six fronts: cotton pruning, hoeing, topdressing, pest control, fertilizer accumulation, and pulling green grass. Except for the team Party branch secretary who grasped the overall work and went deep into key work groups, the remaining five team cadres adopted a method of combining line and group leadership, and were responsible for each. The work groups were assigned according to the importance of farm work, the strength of labor, the level of technology, and the specialties of commune members, combining leadership designation with personal selection to implement the farm work to individuals. The work groups also reasonably matched labor to ensure that everyone was in the right place and could do their best.

"Competing" means competition. In this period of farm work, focusing on "three highs" (attendance rate, quality, efficiency) and "three surpassing" (labor surpassing quotas, enthusiasm surpassing measures, measures surpassing indicators), competitions were launched between groups and between individuals. The team evaluated the work groups every five days and inserted mobile red flags. The work groups checked and accepted the commune members once a day and evaluated them every three days. In the evaluation and competition, martial arts platforms, command platforms, evaluation platforms, honor rolls, and merit books were also established, and model deeds were recorded and commended at any time. At the same time, there was mutual assistance in the competition, and groups, individuals, types of work, and processes all collaborated and supported each other. When the small-stage plan was about to end, it was found that the topdressing progress was the slowest, so labor was drawn from the faster-progressing farm work to support it.

"Summarizing" At the end of this period of farm work, the entire team conducted a mass summary and appraisal by work group, and the Zhou Huibin work group, which completed the task two days early and had good quality, was selected as the red flag group, and advanced commune members were selected to establish models. In the summary, everyone found the reasons why some groups progressed quickly and some groups progressed slowly, and researched ways to improve.

Due to the adoption of the above measures, the enthusiasm of cadres and commune members of the entire team was high, which strongly promoted the current production. At present, the efficiency of the entire team has increased by more than 30%; in the past, 60% of the commune members failed to complete the quotas, but now 80% of the commune members have exceeded the labor quotas. The entire team's cotton fields have been hoeed five to eight times, topdressed three times, and beans, corn, peanuts, etc. have also been hoeed three to five times and topdressed once, ensuring that there are no weeds in the fields and eliminating the three types of seedlings. The commune members are all happy and said: "Labor is well arranged, tasks are known early, work is energetic, and production is high."

    规划农活　安排力量　开展竞赛　总结经验
    周寨大队第五小队把集中的劳力用在“刀刃”上
    据新华社讯　山东高唐县姜店公社周寨大队党支部书记深入基层，帮助第五小队细致安排集中到第一线的人力后，全小队当前生产一片火红。
    第五小队在初步学习以农业为基础的指导思想后，集中了绝大部分劳力投入当前农业生产。但是，大批劳力集中后，劳动管理工作却没有跟上去，因此工效、质量都没有相应提高。大队支部书记周宪礼深入这个小队后，和社员一起劳动，发现了这个问题。贫农社员刘玉昌告诉他：“队干部没有计划，劳力用不到刀刃上。”周宪礼把这些情况提到大队党支部会上研究分析，大家认为这种现象的出现和小队干部缺乏经验有关，便决定首先帮助这个小队的领导干部解决劳力安排问题。
    周宪礼和小队领导干部反复研究了小队的具体情况和当前农活，找出了包括“规”“定”“赛”“总”四项内容的合理安排劳力的方法。
    “规”，就是规划农活。小队干部与作业组长共同研究，根据季节把当前的十六种农活，按照轻重缓急分成五类：一是锄棉花、玉米、豆子、花生、地瓜五项作物；二是棉花整枝、打顶心；三是追肥；四是治虫；五是固定专业队伍积肥和拔草。根据排出来的五大项农活，又算需工账、时间账、出工账、畜力账，按照定额计算共需五百八十个劳动日。这段农活要做五天，参加田间劳动的九十六人能做四百八十个劳动日，尚缺一百个劳动日，就决定通过改革工具，开展协作支援和劳动竞赛等办法来解决。
    “定”是推行定劳力、定领导、定数量、定质量、定时间、定奖惩的责任制。小队正、副队长带领十名社员亲自试工，对原来偏高偏低的定额都加以修订。然后，将劳力分为棉花整枝、锄地、追肥、治虫、积肥、拔青草六条战线，全小队六名干部除队支书掌握全面工作深入重点作业组以外，其余五名采取分线与分组领导相结合的办法，分别负责。作业小组按农活轻重、劳力强弱、技术高低、社员特长，采取领导指派与个人选择相结合的方法，把农活落实到人。作业组并合理搭配劳力，作到人人各得其所，各尽其能。
    “赛”是竞赛。在这段农活中，抓住三高（出勤率、质量、工效）、三超（劳动超定额，干劲超措施，措施超指标），开展了组与组、人与人的对口对手竞赛。小队对作业组五天一次评比，插流动红旗。作业组对社员一天一次检查验收，三天一次评比。在评比竞赛中，还建立了比武台、点将台、评比台、光荣榜、功劳簿，模范事迹随时记录，随时表扬。同时，赛中有帮，组与组、人与人、工种与工种、工序之间都互相协作支援。小段计划将要结束时，发现追肥进度最慢，于是便从进度快的农活抽出劳力支援。
    “总”，这一段农活结束后，全小队以作业组为单位开展群众性的总结鉴定，推选出提前两天完成任务质量又很好的周会斌作业组为红旗组，又选出先进社员，树立标兵。在总结中，大家找出了为什么有的小组进度快有的小组进度慢的原因，并研究出了改进的方法。
    由于采取了以上措施，全小队干部、社员劳动热情高涨，有力地促进了当前生产。目前全队工效提高30％以上；过去有60％的社员完不成定额，现在却有80％的社员超过了劳动定额。全队棉田已普锄五到八遍，追肥三次，豆子、玉米、花生等也普锄三到五遍，追肥一次，保证了地无杂草，消灭了三类苗。社员们都高兴地说：“劳力安排好，任务早知道，干活劲头大，生产高又高。”
