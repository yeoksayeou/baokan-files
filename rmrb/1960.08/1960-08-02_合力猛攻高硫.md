    Concentrated Efforts to Tackle High Sulfur Content
    The Hefei Special Steel Plant in Anhui is making every effort to improve the quality of steel ingots. They are mainly focusing on the cupola furnace, a key to desulfurization, changing the original acidic slag-making to alkaline slag-making, increasing the air blowing volume, raising the air temperature, and extending the furnace lifespan, which has greatly improved the desulfurization capacity of the cupola furnace. Since July, the qualification rate of steel ingots in this plant has increased from over 84% in the first half of the year to over 90%.

    合力猛攻高硫
    安徽合肥特殊钢厂千方百计提高钢锭质量。他们主要抓住化铁炉这一脱硫关键，将原来的酸性造渣改为碱性造渣，加大鼓风量，提高风温，延长炉龄寿命，使化铁炉的除硫能力大大提高。7月份以来，这个厂的钢锭合格率已由上半年的84％上升到90％以上。
