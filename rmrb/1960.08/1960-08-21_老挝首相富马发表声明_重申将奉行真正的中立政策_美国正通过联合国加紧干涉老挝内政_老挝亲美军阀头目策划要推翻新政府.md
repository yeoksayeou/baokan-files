Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 20th: Vientiane Radio broadcast a statement from Prime Minister Phouma this morning, saying that I have formed a new government according to the order of King Sisavang Vatthana on August 14th. This is the second time the King has appointed me to form a government. I presented the cabinet list to the National Assembly at 9:00 a.m. on August 16th, and the National Assembly unanimously approved it at 9:00 a.m. on August 17th.

The statement said, "After the government was approved by the National Assembly, the coup committee announced that it would hand over administrative and military power to the government." It said, "I believe that the people of Vientiane have heard Captain Kong Le's statement and understand the issue."

The statement also said, "The political issue has now been properly resolved. Only the military issue still needs to be resolved. Therefore, I have invited the commanders of all military regions to return to Vientiane as quickly as possible to exchange views for the vital interests of the country."

"My government does not intend to add more ministers, because it believes that the current number is sufficient to carry out the work of the country well. As for the issue of the Lao Fighting Units, I once again declare that I will strictly fulfill the agreement signed in 1957. When the situation in the country is smooth, I will contact their leaders and hold discussions. Some foreign newspapers have said that I intend to invite representatives of the Lao Fighting Units to join the government as ministers. I clarify that this is unfounded. Therefore, I announce that I will not increase the number of members of the government. On the other hand, I reiterate that all internal affairs of Laos are to be resolved by the Lao people, and foreigners have no right to interfere."

The statement said: "Regarding the foreign policy of my government, I have stated many times that the Kingdom of Laos will pursue a truly neutral policy in accordance with the wishes of the Lao people and according to the recent instructions of the King."

According to Vientiane Radio's broadcast this morning, Prince Phouma announced that he is holding negotiations with Phoumi Nosavan. He called on Nosavan's troops not to march on Vientiane to avoid bloodshed among the Lao people.

According to a report from Vientiane today by United Press International, Pierre Dayer, head of the French military delegation in Laos, has arrived in southern Laos with a letter from the new government to Phoumi Nosavan, which includes conditions for negotiations between the two sides. Phoumi Nosavan has established a headquarters in Savannakhet, southern Laos, to direct armed attacks on the coup committee and subvert the new government.

In addition, Vientiane Radio broadcast on the 19th that Prime Minister Phouma received US Ambassador to Laos Brown twice on the 18th. On the same day, Phouma also received the ambassadors of France and Britain to Laos respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 20th: Vientiane Radio broadcast a communique issued by the Royal Lao Government tonight. The communique notified officers and all soldiers, "From today, Major General Van Rattikone will resume his position as Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Armed Forces, and Captain Kong Le will serve as Deputy Commander-in-Chief."

Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: Vientiane News: American imperialism is intensifying its interference in Laos' internal affairs through the United Nations.

According to Western news agencies, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjold's representative, Zerwerg, flew from Vientiane to Luang Prabang on the 18th, attempting to meet with the King of Laos and ask him to take a "clear stance" on the issue of supporting the newly established Phouma government or supporting the head of the extreme pro-American Laotian reactionary warlord group, Phoumi Nosavan, who leads the "anti-coup committee," despite the fact that the Lao National Assembly has already voted no confidence in the former Chao Somsanith-Phoumi Nosavan government, and the new government was authorized by the King of Laos and unanimously approved by the National Assembly.

According to reports, some Western countries' ambassadors to Laos held several meetings on the 19th to discuss the situation in Laos. While Zerwerg was active in Luang Prabang, the US Embassy in Laos used transport planes to evacuate American expatriates in Laos to Bangkok and Saigon on the afternoon of the 19th.

According to Agence France-Presse's report from Vientiane on the 19th, another plane flew over Vientiane at night on the 18th with its lights off, distributing reactionary leaflets signed by the "Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Coup Committee." These leaflets threatened that Phoumi Nosavan's army was "coming soon."

According to the Associated Press from Vientiane, Prime Minister Phouma announced at a press conference on the 19th that an envoy sent to Luang Prabang to request the King's approval of the new government had been arrested by troops opposing the new government there.

Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: Bangkok News: Phoumi Nosavan, the head of the extreme pro-American Laotian warlord group, is stepping up preparations to overthrow the new Laotian government with the active support of the United States and Thailand. According to United Press International today, a Thai reporter returned to Bangkok today after visiting Phoumi Nosavan in Savannakhet, southern Laos. Phoumi Nosavan has established an anti-coup headquarters in Savannakhet. According to reports, Phoumi Nosavan said that he would use economic blockade or military action to "force the revolutionary group in Vientiane to surrender."

According to reports, Nosavan decided to take three steps to subvert the new Laotian government: "implement a strict economic blockade to starve Vientiane," "distribute leaflets to Vientiane," and "if these two steps fail, use force." In doing so, Phoumi Nosavan tried his best to use opposition to the Lao Fighting Units as a cover for his attempt to overthrow the new Laotian government and stifle the Laotian coup committee.

United Press International revealed that Bangkok also received news that Phoumi Nosavan had rejected Phouma's invitation to him to go to Vientiane to discuss the situation.

Phoumi Nosavan's attempt to overthrow the new Laotian government is supported and encouraged by the United States and Thailand.

    声明还说，“政治问题至此已经妥当地解决了。只有军事问题还需要解决。因此，我已经邀请各军区司令急速回到万象，为了国家的重大利益，交换意见。”
      “我的政府不打算再增加大臣，因为它认为现在的人数已经具有足够的能力来良好地进行国家的工作了。至于寮国战斗部队的问题，我再一次声明，我将严正地履行在1957年签订的协议，国家的形势顺利的时候，我将同它们的领导人联系和进行讨论。有一些外国报纸说，我打算邀请寮国战斗部队方面参加政府担任大臣。我更正说这个事情是没有根据的。因此，我宣布，我将不增加政府的成员。另一方面，我再一次声明：老挝的一切内部事务都是由老挝人民来解决的，外国人无权加以干涉。”
    声明说：“关于我的政府的对外政策，我曾经多次声明：老挝王国将根据老挝全国人民的愿望和根据国王最近的指示奉行真正的中立政策。”

    合众国际社透露，曼谷还得到消息说，富米·诺萨万已经拒绝富马请他到万象去讨论局势的邀请。
