Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 15th: More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City held a grand rally on the evening of the 14th to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

　　Liu Tianfu, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, spoke at the meeting. He said that the brilliant victory achieved by the Korean people in the cause of socialist construction has greatly strengthened the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese people extend warm congratulations to the fraternal Korean people.

　　Liu Tianfu then said that the Korean people waged a tenacious and heroic struggle to resist the aggression of US imperialism, and together with the Chinese People's Volunteers, dealt a heavy blow to the enemy, forcing the US aggressors to sign the armistice agreement, thereby extinguishing the flames of war ignited by the US aggressors in Korea and saving Asian and world peace.

　　Liu Tianfu said that US imperialism is still赖在 South Korea and has turned South Korea into a living hell. All these facts prove that the war-loving US imperialism is the most vicious enemy of world peace, and its aggressive nature will never change. We firmly believe that in the excellent situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the US imperialists' criminal conspiracy to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea will be defeated, and the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely achieve final victory.

　　Korean friend Kim Kwang-sun also spoke at the meeting. He said that at present, the strength of the socialist camp is unprecedentedly strong, which is a great encouragement to the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland and the construction of socialism. The Korean people regard further strengthening the friendship and unity between the people of all countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union as their sacred task.

　　Among those who attended the celebration meeting were Yin Linping, Alternate Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Guo Dihuo, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, Jiao Linyi, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Langru, Deputy Mayor of Guangzhou, Lieutenant General Wen Niansheng, head of the Guangzhou troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and other leaders of the provincial and municipal party, government, and military organs, heads of various people's organizations, and former combat hero of the Volunteer Army, Zhao Xingquan, etc.

　　Korean friends in Guangzhou, Czechoslovak Consul in Guangzhou, Kopek, Consul of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Guangzhou, Le Chung Chi, Polish Acting Consul in Guangzhou, Sobzcynski, Head of the Guangzhou Branch of the Soviet Trade Representative Office in China, Gubiankov, and experts and friends from various fraternal countries in Guangzhou were also invited to attend the meeting.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 15th: On the evening of the 14th, more than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Xi'an held a grand meeting to warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

　　Wang Lin, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He said that we warmly congratulate the Korean people on the great victory they have achieved in the struggle against US imperialist aggression and in the cause of socialist construction. The victory of the Korean people is also the victory of the Chinese people and the victory of the entire socialist camp.

　　Wang Lin emphasized that the practice of the Korean War proves that the nature of imperialism will not change. Only by waging a resolute struggle against imperialism can peace be defended. US imperialism is not only the deadly enemy of the peaceful reunification of Korea, but also the most vicious enemy of world peace. We must be vigilant and must not harbor the slightest illusion about imperialism.

　　The head of the German Democratic Republic experts and the representative of Czechoslovak experts in Xi'an also attended the celebration meeting.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 15th: More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Changsha City, the capital of Hunan Province, held a grand rally on the 14th to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

Also attending the celebration meeting were Liu Yudi, a first-class combat hero of the former Volunteer Air Force, Luo Diekai, the father of internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, and Korean friend Liu Ziming, who works in Hunan.

　　Li Ruishan, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He said that the people of China and Korea have accumulated rich experience in the long-term struggle against imperialism. We believe that the people of our two countries will surely be able to work together with the people of all countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and with the people of the world to make greater contributions to opposing US imperialism and defending world peace.

　　Subsequently, Liu Yudi and Luo Diekai spoke at the meeting one after another.

    广州、西安、长沙各界人民
    集会庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年
    据新华社广州15日电　广东省、广州市各界一千多人14日晚举行大会，隆重庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年。
    广东省副省长刘田夫在会上讲话。他说，朝鲜人民在社会主义建设事业中取得的辉煌胜利，大大地加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，中国人民向兄弟的朝鲜人民，表示热烈祝贺。
    刘田夫接着说，朝鲜人民为了抗击美帝国主义的侵略，进行了顽强英勇的斗争，并和中国人民志愿军一道给予敌人以严重的打击，迫使美国侵略者不得不在停战协定上签字，从而扑灭了美国侵略者在朝鲜点起的战火，拯救了亚洲与世界和平。
    刘田夫说，美帝国主义至今仍然赖在南朝鲜不走，把南朝鲜变成了人间地狱。这一切事实都证明：好战成性的美帝国主义是世界和平最凶恶的敌人，它的侵略本性是绝不会改变的。我们坚信：在东风压倒西风的大好形势下，美帝国主义阻挠朝鲜和平统一的罪恶阴谋一定会遭到挫败，朝鲜人民争取和平统一祖国的斗争，必将取得最后的胜利。
    朝鲜友人金光善也在会上讲话。他说，目前，社会主义阵营的力量空前壮大，这对朝鲜人民和平统一祖国和建设社会主义的斗争是巨大的鼓舞。朝鲜人民把进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民之间的友谊团结，看作是自己的神圣任务。
