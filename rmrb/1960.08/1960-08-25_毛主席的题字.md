    Chairman Mao's Inscription

    The eight characters "Self-Reliance" and "Ample Food and Clothing" are the inscription our great leader Chairman Mao wrote for the Eighth Route Army's Great Production Movement during the Anti-Japanese War. These two inscriptions are now on display in the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution.

    In 1942, along with the Rectification Movement, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, in order to overcome difficulties, reduce the people's burden, and persist in the War of Resistance, put forward the call to develop production.

    In accordance with Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction, all troops, Party and government organs, and school personnel in the Liberated Areas started to work with their own hands, successively launching a large-scale production upsurge. At that time, the 359th Brigade led by General Wang Zhen made outstanding achievements in Nanniwan, northern Shaanxi. Because of self-reliance, the entire army launched a great production movement, and the troops achieved complete self-sufficiency in clothing, food, etc., from partial self-sufficiency. The soldiers realized what Chairman Mao said in his inscription, "Self-Reliance" and "Ample Food and Clothing," through their own hard work. Under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao, the revolutionary army and cadres learned the ability to regenerate through one's own effort and cultivated a spirit of hard struggle. Moreover, they reduced the burden on the people, strengthened the relationship between the army and the people, and strengthened the unity between superiors and subordinates. The far-reaching significance of the Great Production Movement is not limited to this, as Chairman Mao said:

    "The rectification movement and the production movement, which began successively in 1942 and 1943, played and are playing a decisive role in the spiritual and material life respectively. If we do not seize these two links at the appropriate time, we will not be able to grasp the entire revolutionary chain, and our struggle will not be able to continue to advance."

    In the years of war, we relied on self-reliance and hard struggle to defeat Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. Today, relying on our own two hands and material and technical foundation, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we will surely be able to build our motherland into a prosperous and strong socialist country at high speed through hard struggle and thrift.

    Chairman Mao's autograph inscription is not only a precious revolutionary relic but also remains a "motto" for us now and in the future. (Shi Zao)

    毛主席的题字
    “自己动手”，“丰衣足食”这八个字是我们伟大领袖毛主席在抗日战争时期为八路军大生产运动题的字。这两幅题字，现在陈列在中国人民革命军事博物馆里。
    党中央和毛主席在1942年与整风运动的同时，为了克服困难、减轻人民负担，坚持抗战，提出了发展生产的号召。
    根据毛主席的这一英明指示，解放区所有部队、党政机关和学校人员，都自己动起手来，先后掀起了大规模的生产热潮。当时王震将军所领导的三五九旅在陕北南泥湾做出了出色的成绩。由于自己动手，全军展开大生产运动，部队衣食等由部分自给达到了全部自给，战士们以自己辛勤的劳动实现了毛主席题字中所说的“自己动手”，“丰衣足食”。在毛主席的直接领导下，革命的军队和干部学会了自力更生的本领，培养了艰苦奋斗的作风，而且减轻了人民的负担，密切了军民关系，加强了上下之间的团结。大生产的深远意义还不只此，正如毛主席所说：
    “1942和1943两年先后开始的带普遍性的整风运动和生产运动，曾经分别地在精神生活方面和物质生活方面起了和正在起着决定性的作用。这两个环子，如果不在适当的时机抓住它们，我们就无法抓住整个的革命链条，而我们的斗争也就不能继续前进。”
    在战争的年代里，我们依靠自力更生，艰苦奋斗打败了日本帝国主义和蒋介石反动统治。今天，我们依靠自己的两只手和物质技术基础，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国，也一定可以高速度地把我们祖国建设成繁荣强盛的社会主义国家。
    毛主席的亲笔题字，不仅仅是件珍贵的革命文物，而且仍然是我们现在和将来的一个“座右铭”。　（世藻）
