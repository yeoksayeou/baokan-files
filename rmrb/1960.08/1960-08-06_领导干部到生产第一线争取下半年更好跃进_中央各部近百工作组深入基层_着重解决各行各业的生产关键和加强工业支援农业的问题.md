Xinhua News Agency, 5th August: Central industrial and transportation departments have recently dispatched a large number of work groups to the production frontline, further combining leadership work with the broad masses, making economic work more and more meticulous, and striving for greater achievements in production and capital construction in the second half of the year.

According to statistics from twelve ministries including Metallurgy, Machine Building, Coal, Water Conservancy and Electric Power, Chemical Industry, Textile, Railways, and Transportation, nearly one hundred work groups, totaling about two thousand people, have departed from Beijing successively since the beginning of July.

The majority of these work groups are personally led by ministers or vice-ministers of the respective ministries, and are composed of responsible cadres from relevant departments, bureaus, divisions, and sections, as well as engineering and technical personnel. For example, the work groups from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the Ministry of Transportation have already gone deep into key factories, mines, and construction sites in various regions. They will work alongside the workers and masses on all fronts to focus on solving key production problems in all industries.

Strengthening support for agriculture is an important task for industrial departments at present. To this end, the work groups dispatched by various ministries will also help various regions focus on solving problems in this area. For example, in order to expand fertilizer production, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has already sent two vice-ministers leading work groups to Shanghai, Nanjing, Shijiazhuang, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, Sichuan and other places to specifically study and solve the problems of increasing production and expanding the construction of synthetic ammonia plants. The Ministry of Agricultural Machinery has formed eight work groups composed of directors and chiefs of various departments and bureaus, as well as key engineering and technical personnel, and they departed at the end of July. They will focus on inspecting and arranging the production of irrigation and drainage machinery, agricultural tools for autumn plowing, autumn planting, and autumn harvesting, as well as tractors, and the supply of raw materials.

In order to powerfully assist factories, mines, enterprises, and transportation departments in various regions to break through key production problems, the various ministries have also transferred a large number of outstanding technical personnel from their subordinate departments, bureaus, and institutes to form various technical work groups. For example, the twenty-seven technical work groups dispatched by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry are helping small blast furnaces in various regions to improve output and quality, helping small converters to pass the technical hurdle of alkaline and hot-air operation, and helping black and non-ferrous metal mines in various regions solve various specific technical problems. The twenty-three technical promotion teams formed by the First Ministry of Machine Building will go to more than twenty provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to vigorously promote major new technologies and new experiences summarized in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

    领导干部到生产第一线争取下半年更好跃进
    中央各部近百工作组深入基层
    着重解决各行各业的生产关键和加强工业支援农业的问题
    新华社5日讯　中央各工业交通部门最近派出大批工作组到生产第一线，使领导工作进一步和广大群众相结合，把经济工作愈作愈细，争取下半年生产和基本建设取得更大成绩。
    据冶金、机械、煤炭、水利电力、化工、纺织、铁道、交通等十二个部的统计，从7月初到现在，已有将近一百个工作组，约二千人从北京陆续出发。
    这批工作组大部分由各部部长或副部长亲自率领，由有关司、局、处、科的负责干部及工程技术人员组成。其中如冶金工业部、第一机械工业部、煤炭工业部、化学工业部和交通部的工作组，已经深入各地重点厂矿和工地。他们将在那里同各个战线上的职工群众一道，着重解决各行各业的生产关键问题。
    加强对农业的支援，是当前工业部门的一项重要任务。为此，各部派出的工作组，还要帮助各地着重解决这方面的问题。如化学工业部为扩大肥料生产，现在已有二个副部长带领工作组到上海、南京、石家庄、开封、太原、四川等地，专门研究和解决合成氨厂的增产和扩建问题。农业机械部由各司、局长和主要工程技术人员组成八个工作组，已在7月底出发。他们将着重检查和安排排灌机械、秋耕秋种秋收农具及拖拉机等的生产和原料材料的供应。
    为了有力地帮助各地厂矿企业及交通运输部门突破生产关键，各部还从所属司、局、院抽调大批优秀技术人员另外组成各种技术工作组。如冶金工业部派出的二十七个技术工作组，正在帮助各地小高炉提高产量、质量，帮助小转炉过好碱性、热风的操作技术关，以及帮助各地黑色和有色金属矿山解决各项具体技术问题。第一机械工业部组成的二十三个技术推广队，将到二十多个省、市、区，大力推广技术革新和技术革命运动中总结出来的重大新技术和新经验。
