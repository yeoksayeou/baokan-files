Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 1st: The government of the German Democratic Republic has issued a memorandum on the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the signing of the Potsdam Agreement.

The memorandum states that the principal nations of the anti-Hitler coalition agreed in the Potsdam Agreement on the principle of establishing a peaceful and democratic Germany. These principles aligned with the demands of German anti-fascists who made enormous sacrifices in the struggle against Hitlerite fascism. These principles aligned with the wishes of all peace-loving forces within the German people. The Potsdam Agreement reiterated the lessons of the Second World War and charged the nations of the anti-Hitler coalition with eradicating German militarism and Nazism, so that Germany would never again threaten its neighbors or world peace. The agreement stipulated: complete disarmament of Germany, prohibition of all military organizations, prohibition of any militaristic and fascist propaganda, prohibition and dissolution of the Nazi Party and the Hitlerite Wehrmacht and its affiliated institutions, and implementation of precautionary measures to prevent their revival in any form, arrest of all war criminals and their submission to trial, removal of fascists from all public and semi-public positions, thorough elimination of any Nazi and militaristic theories in education, and crushing of the German monopoly capitalist organizations, as they were the culprits behind the launching of two world wars.

The German people would be given the opportunity to rebuild political life on a democratic and peaceful basis throughout Germany, and German unity would be maintained. The elimination of "excessive concentration of economic power as exemplified in cartels, syndicates, trusts, and other monopolistic agreements," reform of the judicial system in accordance with democratic principles and the rule of law, establishment of new administrative organs on a democratic basis, implementation of a new educational system, and the free activity of democratic parties and groups - all of this would lay a solid and lasting democratic foundation in Germany.

The memorandum continues by saying that in eastern Germany, the anti-fascist democratic forces of the people, with the full support of the Soviet occupation authorities, have implemented the principles of the Potsdam Agreement. The fascist Wehrmacht and its affiliated organizations have been completely dissolved, and the Nazi Party and all its affiliated organizations have been thoroughly eliminated. War criminals and Nazi criminals have been punished, and their power in industry and agriculture has been stripped away. The sinister specter of fascist and militaristic crimes has been extinguished. Fundamental democratic reforms have changed the education, judicial, and administrative systems. As a result, an anti-fascist democratic social system has developed, thereby creating a lasting guarantee against the revival of Nazism and militarism.

The memorandum states that, as a member of the socialist camp, united with all other peace-loving nations and relying on its own strength and stability, the German Democratic Republic is the force in Germany that prevents German militarism from launching another march toward the East and Southeast.

The memorandum says that the German Democratic Republic has consistently adhered to the principles of the Potsdam Agreement. It is a peace-loving and democratic German state that safeguards the interests of the entire German nation. However, the various principles and major requirements of the agreement have not been put into practice in West Germany, but have been most grossly violated.

The memorandum states that political power in West Germany is in the hands of the forces responsible for launching the First and Second World Wars. The monopoly capitalist groups – the organizers of two world wars – have never been touched. The Hitlerite Wehrmacht has never been completely eliminated in West Germany. The democratization of political life in West Germany has been prevented. Unrepentant Nazi adherents hold positions in West German state organs. People who seek to abide by the principles of the Potsdam Agreement and advocate peace and understanding with other countries are subjected to extremely severe persecution. By signing the Petersberg Agreement regarding the implementation of West German occupation regulations, and especially through the Paris Agreements of October 1954, which brought West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Bonn government created a state of affairs in which the western regions were effectively separated from a unified Germany. This made West Germany a satellite of the United States, and also officially opened the way for West German militarism to build an aggressive army.

The memorandum emphasizes: "The Western nations, particularly the United States, bear major responsibility for undermining the Potsdam Agreement and actively supporting the revival of West German militarism. By continuously violating the Potsdam Agreement, they have lost the legal basis for stationing occupation troops."

The memorandum states that the German Democratic Republic deems it necessary to take the following measures:

	Condemn the revanchist propaganda of the Federal Republic of Germany and its formally asserted territorial claims against other countries, deeming this to be the ideological preparation for aggression.

	Condemn the establishment of a Wehrmacht commanded by vengeful Hitlerite generals and the equipping of this army with rockets and weapons of mass destruction, deeming this to be a grave threat to peace; and demand an immediate halt to the arming carried out by West Germany.

	Forbid the sale or lease of rockets or atomic weapons to the Federal Republic of Germany, prohibit the Federal Republic of Germany from using atomic energy for military purposes, prohibit cooperation with the Federal Republic in this regard, and prohibit the provision of related facilities and documents to the Federal Republic.

	Forbid the provision of territory to the Federal Republic for the establishment of military bases, the conduct of exercises, the establishment of arms depots, or the training of troops.

	Forbid the sale or lease of weapons, aircraft, warships, or other war equipment to the Federal Republic, and prohibit the granting of licenses to the Federal Republic to manufacture such war equipment, and prohibit cooperation with the Federal Republic in any other sector of the armaments industry.

	Remove all Nazi war criminals and other war criminals from positions in the state organs, government, Wehrmacht, judicial system, police forces, education system of the Federal Republic, and in other sectors of the West German state.

	Reject the claim that the Federal Republic is the sole Germany and represents the whole of Germany on the international stage, as this is an expression of aggressive intentions toward the German Democratic Republic and also violates the principle of equal rights under international law.

The government of the German Democratic Republic believes that taking the above measures is necessary because these measures will eliminate the danger of war posed by German militarism and will help ensure peace.

The memorandum concludes by saying that the conclusion of peace treaties with the two German states will ensure that the principles of the Potsdam Agreement are observed throughout Germany and will eliminate the remnants of the Second World War. This will end the abnormal state of West Berlin, making it a demilitarized free city, thereby eliminating a dangerous source of tension.

    德国政府就波茨坦协定十五周年发表备忘录
    要求清除西德军国主义势力
    指出美国应对破坏波茨坦协定负重大责任
    新华社柏林1日电　德意志民主共和国政府在波茨坦协定签订十五周年之际发表了备忘录。
    备忘录说，反希特勒同盟的主要国家在波茨坦协定中同意建立一个和平和民主的德国的原则。这些原则符合在反希特勒法西斯主义的斗争中作出巨大牺牲的德国反法西斯主义者的要求。这些原则符合德国人民中所有爱好和平的力量的愿望。波茨坦协定重申第二次世界大战的教训，并责成反希特勒同盟各国根除德国军国主义和纳粹主义，以使德国永远不再威胁它的邻国或世界和平。协定决定：解除德国的全部武装，禁止一切军事组织，不准进行任何军国主义和法西斯主义宣传，禁止和解散纳粹党和希特勒国防军及其附属机构，并采取戒备措施来防止它们在任何形式之下的复活，逮捕所有战犯并把他们提交审讯，在一切公职和半公职中清除法西斯分子，彻底在教育中消弭任何纳粹和军国主义理论，粉碎德国的垄断资本组织，因为它们是发动两次世界大战的罪魁祸首。
    德国人民将被赋与在民主和和平的基础上在整个德国范围内重建政治生活的机会，德国统一将予以保持。消灭“卡特尔、辛迪加、托辣斯及其它独占协定所形成之经济力量之过份集中”、按照民主和依法律之正义的原则改革司法制度、在民主基础上建立新的行政机构、实行新的教育制度和实行民主党派及团体的自由活动，这一切将在德国奠定一个巩固和持久的民主基础。
    备忘录接着说，在德国东部，得到苏联占领当局充分支持的人民反法西斯民主力量已经把波茨坦协定的原则付诸实施。法西斯国防军及其所属组织已经被完全解散，纳粹党及其一切所属组织已被彻底消灭。战犯和纳粹罪犯已经被惩办，他们在工农业方面的权力已经被剥夺。法西斯和军国主义的罪恶的阴魂已被扑灭。根本的民主改革已经改变了教育、司法和行政制度。因此，反法西斯的民主社会制度已经发展起来，从而创建了防止纳粹主义和军国主义复活的持久的保证。
    备忘录说，作为社会主义国家阵营中的一员，同所有其他爱好和平的国家联合在一起依靠自己的力量和稳定，德意志民主共和国是在德国阻止德国军国主义发动另一次向东方和东南方进军的力量。
    备忘录说，德意志民主共和国一直遵循波茨坦协定的原则。它是爱好和平与民主的德意志国家，它维护着整个德国民族的利益。但是，协定的各项原则和主要要求在西德没有付诸实践，而是受到最粗暴的违反。
    备忘录说，西德的政权操在应对发动第一次和第二次世界大战负责的势力的手中。垄断资本集团——两次世界大战的组织者——始终未被触动。希特勒国防军在西德从来没有被完全消灭。西德政治生活的民主化受到阻止。怙恶不悛的纳粹主义信徒在西德国家机关中任职。力求遵守波茨坦协定的原则、主张和平和同其他国家谅解的人们受到极其严重的迫害。波恩政府通过签订关于履行西德占领法规的彼得斯堡协定，特别是通过使西德加入北大西洋公约组织的1954年10月的巴黎协定，造成西部地区事实上从统一的德国分裂出去的状态。这样就使西德成为美国的卫星国，也正式为西德军国主义打开了建立一支侵略军的道路。
    备忘录强调说：“西方国家，特别是美国，应对破坏波茨坦协定和积极支持西德德国军国主义复活负重大的责任。由于不断违反波茨坦协定，他们已经失去驻扎占领军的法律根据。”
    备忘录说，德意志民主共和国认为有必要采取如下的措施：
    谴责德意志联邦共和国的复仇主义宣传和它对其他国家的领土正式提出的要求，认为这是侵略的思想准备。
    谴责建立在企图复仇的希特勒将领们指挥下的国防军和用火箭和大规模毁灭性武器来装配这支军队，认为这是对和平的严重威胁；并要求立即停止西德所实行的武装。
    不准向德意志联邦共和国出售和出租火箭或原子武器，禁止德意志联邦共和国把原子能用于军事目的，不准在这方面同联邦共和国进行合作，不准向联邦共和国提供有关的便利和文件。
    不准为联邦共和国提供领土来建立军事基地、进行演习、建立军火仓库或训练军队。
    不准向联邦共和国出售或出租武器、飞机、军舰或其他战争装备，也不准给予联邦共和国制造这些战争装备的许可，不准在军备工业的其它任何部门同联邦共和国合作。
    解除一切纳粹战犯和其他战犯在联邦共和国的国家机关、政府、国防军、司法系统、警察部队、教育系统和在西德国家其他部门中担任的职务。
    否认联邦共和国是唯一的德国和在国际舞台上代表整个德国的说法，因为这是对德意志民主共和国的侵略意图的表示，并且也是违反国际法的平等权利原则的。
    德意志民主共和国政府认为，采取上述各项措施是必要的，因为这些措施将消除德国军国主义所造成的战争危险并将有助于确保和平。
    备忘录最后说，同两个德国缔结和约将使波茨坦协定的原则在整个德国得到遵守，并将消除第二次世界大战的残迹。这将结束西柏林的不正常状态，使之成为非军事化的自由城市，从而消除危险的发源地。
