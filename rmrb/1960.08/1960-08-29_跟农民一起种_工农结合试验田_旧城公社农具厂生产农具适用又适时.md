Jinan, August 28th (report from our newspaper) The Jiucheng People's Commune Iron and Wood Farm Tool Repair Factory in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, has adopted the method of planting "worker-peasant integration experimental fields" and organizing workers to regularly participate in agricultural labor, to deeply understand the needs of agricultural production in a timely manner, and to manufacture and repair farm tools accordingly, effectively serving agriculture.

The Party Branch Secretary, Factory Director, Iron and Wood Workers of this factory, together with the Commune Party Committee Secretary and members of the production team, jointly cultivated twenty mu of "worker-peasant integration experimental fields." The factory workers regularly learn about agricultural production from the experimental fields and test new farm tools there. For example, when reforming farm tools, the factory, according to the requirements put forward by the Commune Party Committee and various production teams, first has the factory's Technical Innovation Committee draw up blueprints and make models, which are then handed over to the operators of the "worker-peasant integration experimental fields" for research, and then trial-produced; after production, they are taken to the experimental fields for testing; the Technical Innovation Committee further studies and improves the tools based on the actual field test results, or hands them over to the factory for formal production. The factory's manufactured five-purpose sweet potato ridging machine, three-purpose Soviet-style cultivator, fertilizer applicator, multi-head sprayer, deep plough, furrower and other forty-odd kinds of farm tools, have all been made through several tests and "consultations" in the experimental fields, thus being able to meet the needs of local agricultural production.

In order to constantly and deeply understand the needs of agricultural production, the factory also adopted the method of "agriculture is very busy, industry is less busy; agriculture is less busy, industry is very busy" to organize workers to regularly participate in agricultural labor. For example, during the summer harvest and summer planting season this year, they assigned 80% of the labor force to directly participate in agricultural production, leaving 20% of the manpower to engage in industrial production; during the current period of field management, 50% of the workers are assigned to participate in the commune's field management and to work in the "worker-peasant integration experimental fields." This practice enables workers to regularly understand the needs of agricultural production very clearly, and to supply farm tools in a timely and effective manner. For example, when the Party Branch Secretary of the factory, Jing Xizhi, worked with the commune members, he found that there was a shortage of pest control tools. After returning to the factory, he immediately mobilized the workers to rush to make multi-head sprayers, powder guns, and powder applicators, and made more than 400 units in ten days, increasing the commune's daily pest control progress from 3,400 mu to 5,290 mu.

    跟农民一起种“工农结合试验田”
    旧城公社农具厂生产农具适用又适时
    本报济南28日电　山东省高唐县旧城人民公社铁木农具修造厂采取种“工农结合试验田”和组织职工经常参加农业劳动的办法，及时深入地了解农业生产的需要，据以制造和修理农具，切实有效地为农业服务。
    这个厂的党支部书记、厂长、铁木工人和公社党委书记、生产队的社员，共同种了二十亩“工农结合试验田”。这个厂的职工经常从试验田里了解农业生产情况，并在试验田里试验新制的农具。例如，在改革农具时，厂里根据公社党委和各生产队提出的要求，先由厂的技术革新委员会绘图纸，造模型，交“工农结合试验田”的经营人员研究，然后试制；制出以后，拿到试验田里试验；技术革新委员会根据实地试验的情况，进一步研究改进或交厂内正式生产。这个厂制造的五用地瓜扶垅机、三用苏式中耕器、追肥器、多头喷雾器、深耕犁、筑畦器等四十多种农具，都是经过在试验田中几次试验、“会诊”制成的，因而能适合当地农业生产的需要。
    为了经常地深入地了解农业生产的需要，这个厂还采取“农业大忙，工业小干；农业小忙，工业大干”的办法，组织职工经常参加农业劳动。如今年夏收、夏种时期，他们就抽出80％的劳动力直接参加农业生产，留20％的人力搞工业生产；在当前搞田间管理的时期，就抽50％的职工参加公社的田间管理和到“工农结合试验田”去劳动。这种作法，使职工们对农业生产上的需要经常了解得很清楚，能够及时切实地供应农具。例如，这个厂的党支部书记景希芝和社员一起劳动时，发现治虫工具不足，回厂后就立即发动工人赶制多头喷雾器、喷粉炮、喷粉器，十天就制好了四百多部，使公社治虫日进度由三千四百亩，提高到五千二百九十亩。（附图片）
