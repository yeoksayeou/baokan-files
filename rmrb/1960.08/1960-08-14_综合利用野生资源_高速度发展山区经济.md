Comprehensive Utilization of Wild Resources for High-Speed Development of Mountainous Economy
The Communist Party Committee of Wen County

The county and commune industries of Bikou Town, Wen County, Gansu Province, are implementing "one factory, multiple capabilities, one material, multiple uses," extensively and comprehensively utilizing wild resources, finding a broad path for the most reasonable, most economical, and fullest utilization of existing resources and equipment, and the high-speed development of the mountainous economy.

Bikou is a mountainous forest area located on the banks of the Bailong River, with lush water and grass, evergreen in all seasons, and abundant wild resources. There are more than a thousand kinds of wild plants and animals that can be utilized. Among them, wild fibers, starches, oils, medicinal materials, and tannin extracts are produced everywhere. Although there are unique natural conditions here, due to the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang before liberation, coupled with deep mountains and valleys and traffic jams, abundant resources could not be utilized, and the lives of farmers were very poor. Even a pair of cloth shoes and a thread for sewing clothes had to be bought from Sichuan, forty miles away. People lived a life of "begging for food with golden pots and silver bowls." After liberation, with the great development of transportation, the Bikou area vigorously developed county and commune industries in 1958 and 1959, and vigorously grasped the comprehensive utilization of wild plants. As of now, fourteen comprehensive wild raw material processing plants have been established, with production projects including rayon cloth, papermaking, winemaking, bamboo and rattan weaving, soap making, wild oil processing, and aquatic product processing, with more than 300 kinds of products. Last year's total output value was more than 866,600 yuan, of which the output value of county-run industries accounted for more than 290,000 yuan, and the output value of commune-run industries of Bikou People's Commune was more than 573,000 yuan. The total output value of commune-run industries has accounted for 31% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. With the further development of technical innovation and technical revolution, since last winter, we have taken a series of measures to implement "one factory, multiple capabilities, one material, multiple uses," and fully utilize resources and equipment. From January to May this year, the average monthly output value of county and commune industries has jumped to more than 123,000 yuan, an increase of more than 50% over the average monthly output value last year.

The extensive utilization of wild resources by county and commune industries in the Bikou area has promoted the rapid development of the mountainous economy. However, this path was forged through thorns. At the beginning of the factory construction, many people were superstitious about "foreign" methods and looked down on "small indigenous groups," saying, "A factory is a factory, the machines must be noisy; if the machines are not noisy, it is not a factory." In order to solve these ideological problems, the county and commune party committees widely carried out propaganda and education work among the commune members on "taking grain as the key link, comprehensively developing diversified operations, and developing the mountainous economy at high speed," so that the broad masses of commune members realized that suiting measures to local conditions and comprehensively utilizing wild resources is an important measure for building mountainous areas and promoting the economic development of mountains and rivers. After the county and commune party committees laid a good ideological foundation, they determined the principle of building factories: build factories based on available raw materials, process what is produced; do not build what is not available, and make great efforts to develop what is available." As a result, in the winter of 1958, there was a surge in the construction of factories by counties, communes, and production teams, and by the end of 1959, more than 50 factories of various types had been established. However, at this time, because there was no clear division of labor between county and commune industries and production team sideline occupations, contradictions arose in the supply and demand of raw materials, and production could not be planned and proportional; at the same time, the factories could not cooperate closely, resulting in some production disconnections. For example, the rayon factory's processed products were unwilling to be used by spinning and weaving factories, resulting in the phenomenon of stockpiling raw materials on the one hand, and frequent production interruptions due to lack of raw materials on the other hand. In order to solve the above problems, county and commune industries conducted a clear division of labor, and proposed that the key processing projects are: wild fibers, starches, wild vegetables, bamboo and rattan, and oils with large quantities and wide areas. Among them, papermaking, bamboo and rattan weaving, winemaking, vinegar making, and non-staple food processing, which have a wider scope of operation, larger investment, more complex technology, require more labor, and undertake the task of supplying the whole county, are operated by county-run factories; rayon, spinning, weaving, shoemaking, wild oil processing, aquatic product processing, manufacturing of indigenous pesticides, and manufacturing of indigenous fertilizers, which have more scattered resources, small investment, less labor, and relatively simple technology, are operated by commune-run factories. According to this principle, the original 50 factories were adjusted and merged, and fourteen comprehensive processing plants were established according to the nature of production, and each factory has four or five specialized workshops. Among them, there are four county-run factories and five commune-run factories that process wild plants. Close cooperation relationships have been established between factories and factories, and between workshops and workshops. In terms of business management, capital accounting, and technology, county-run factories have the responsibility to guide commune-run factories; in terms of raw materials, commune-run factories support county-run factories with semi-finished products. Workshops support the peak seasons of brother workshops from their own off-seasons in terms of labor and equipment according to the production characteristics, making them more suitable for the characteristics of wild raw material processing, seizing seasonal production, and ensuring that there is work to do every season and that the output value is guaranteed.

The prominent feature of comprehensive utilization of wild raw materials in the Bikou area is to closely combine industrial production with rural sideline production, promoting each other and prospering together. What raw materials are needed by industry, and what raw materials are produced or collected by sideline industries in a planned and needed manner. In the continuous expansion of the scope of comprehensive utilization, the types of raw materials needed are increasing, and the ways of rural sideline production are becoming wider and wider. The methods adopted by county and commune factories in solving the problem of raw materials are: large quantities of wild fibers, starches, bamboo and rattan, etc., are uniformly arranged by the commune according to the planned needs of each factory, and allocated to the production teams in various production areas, organizing semi-laborers and incidental laborers to establish fixed professional teams for production or collection; for small or scattered wild fruits, leaves, stems, flowers, roots, and wild vegetables, factories and teams are linked up, and production teams organize commune members to collect them using agricultural gaps; for wild oils, starches, and miscellaneous fungi with particularly strong seasonality, commune members are organized in the summer and autumn seasons to launch "small summer harvest" and "small autumn harvest" campaigns; for newly discovered raw materials, each factory sends specimens to each production team to organize commune members to collect them. These raw materials are uniformly purchased by commercial departments and uniformly allocated according to the plan or the contract signed by the factory and the team. At present, there are more than 100 kinds of wild plant raw materials that are comprehensively utilized in the Bikou area, of which more than 30 kinds have been newly added in the first half of this year. This not only expands the ways of sideline production, but also increases the varieties of comprehensive utilization. For example, the winery originally only produced seven or eight kinds of wine, but this year it increased to 29 kinds, and the contradiction of supply exceeding demand for raw materials has been resolved.

The comprehensive utilization of wild resources in the Bikou area is carried out under the guidance of the idea of ​​continuous revolution. Because the idea of ​​"comprehensive utilization has no top, and wild resources cannot be exhausted" has been established, the road is getting wider and wider. In order to achieve comprehensive utilization of the main raw materials, each factory determines the raw materials for key processing, and many factories also have comprehensive workshops in addition to specialized workshops, which are specifically responsible for experimenting with the utilization of waste products and processing newly discovered raw materials to maximize the comprehensive utilization rate. At present, the main raw materials such as bracken roots, kudzu roots, mountain grasses, reed grasses, bamboo and rattan, and wild vegetables have all achieved multiple uses for one material. Each factory has its own main products and by-products. For example, the winery could only make wine in the past, but now it uses a raw material to bake glue, brew wine (extract alcohol), make vinegar, and extract feed, and the remaining residue is mixed with phosphate rock by the indigenous chemical factory and composted into phosphate fertilizer, reaching five uses. After the scope of comprehensive utilization was expanded, the wine yield per 100 kg of raw materials increased from 30% to 34%, and 22 kg of baked glue and three other by-products, which were close to the value of wine, were added. The wild fiber comprehensive processing plant saves the country more than 520 feet of cotton cloth every season after making cotton, weaving cloth, and making shoes with reed grass. This year, they also used local bitter lotus seeds (poisonous tree seeds) to replace flour paste to line the shoes, so that all the raw materials for making shoes except the shoe face cloth are replaced by wild raw materials. The comprehensive utilization of wild raw materials in the Bikou area alone saved the country more than 2 million kilograms of grain last year, and the cost of various products produced this year is generally 20%-40% lower than last year.

The workers of county and commune industries in the Bikou area were originally farmers, 70% of whom were women with no production skills. Through two years of training, 70% of the more than 500 workers have become experts and mastered industrial production technology, of which 30% have become all-rounders.

    综合利用野生资源  高速度发展山区经济
    中共文县委员会
    甘肃省文县碧口镇的县、社工业，实行“一厂多能，一物多用”，广泛地综合利用野生资源，为最合理、最节约、最充分地利用现有资源和设备、高速度地发展山区经济，找到一条广阔的道路。
    碧口是个山林地区，位于白龙江畔，水草丰美，四季常青，野生资源相当丰富。可以利用的野生动植物在一千种以上。其中，野生纤维、淀粉、油料、药材和栲胶等原料遍地皆产。这里虽然有得天独厚的自然条件，但是在解放前，由于国民党的反动统治，加上山大沟深，交通阻塞，丰富的资源无法利用，农民生活十分贫困，甚至连一双布鞋、一条缝衣服的线也得到四十里以外的四川去买。人民过着“端着金盆银碗讨饭吃”的生活。解放后，随着交通事业的大发展，碧口地区在1958年和1959年大力发展县社工业，狠抓野生植物综合利用。截至目前，已建立综合性的野生原料加工厂十四个，生产项目包括人造棉布、造纸、酿酒、竹藤编织、制肥皂、野生油料加工、水产加工等，产品达三百多种。去年的总产值为八十六万六千多元，其中县办工业产值占二十九万多元，碧口人民公社社办工业产值为五十七万三千多元。社办工业总产值已占工农业总产值的31％。随着技术革新和技术革命的进一步开展，从去冬以来，我们采取一系列措施，实行“一厂多能，一物多用”，充分利用资源和设备。今年元月至5月，县社工业的平均月产值又跃增到十二万三千多元，比去年的平均月产值增长50％以上。
    碧口地区县社工业广泛利用野生资源，促进了山区经济的迅速发展。但是，这条道路是在荆棘丛中走出来的。开头办厂时，许多人迷信“洋”办法，看不起“小土群”，说：“工厂工厂，机器要响；机器不响，不成工厂”。为了解决这些思想问题，县、社党委在社员中广泛开展了“以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营，高速度发展山区经济”的宣传教育工作，使广大社员认识到因地制宜，综合利用野生资源是建设山区、促进山川经济发展的一项重要措施。县社党委打好思想基础以后，又确定建厂的原则是：有啥原料办啥厂，出产什么加工什么；没有的不办，有的大搞特搞。”结果就在1958年冬季出现了县办、社办、队队办工厂的热潮，到1959年底共办起各类厂子五十多个。但是这时，由于县、社工业和生产队副业之间没有明确分工，原料供求上发生了矛盾，不能有计划按比例的生产；同时各厂之间不能紧密配合，形成某些生产脱节现象。例如，人造棉厂加工的产品，纺纱、织布厂不愿利用，因而造成一方面积压原料，另一方面因原料缺乏，生产时常中断的现象。为了解决上述问题，县、社工业进行了明确分工，提出重点加工的项目是：量大面宽的野生纤维、淀粉、野菜、竹藤、油料等。其中经营范围较广、投资较大、技术比较复杂、需要劳力较多、担负全县供应任务的造纸、竹藤编织、酿酒、制醋、副食品加工等，由县办厂经营；资源较分散、投资小、花费劳力少、技术比较单纯的人造棉、纺纱、织布、制鞋、野生油料加工、水产加工、制造土农药、制造土化肥等，由社办厂经营。根据这一原则，对原有五十个厂子进行调整合并，按生产性质建立了十四个综合性的加工厂，每个厂设有四、五个专业车间。其中加工野生植物的县办厂有四个，社办厂有五个。在厂与厂、车间与车间又建立了密切的协作关系。在经营管理、资金核算、技术等方面，县办厂有指导社办厂的责任；在原料方面，社办厂以半成品支援县办厂。车间与车间根据生产特点，在自己的淡季，从劳力、设备等方面支援兄弟车间的旺季，使之更适合于野生原料加工的特点，抓住季节性生产，做到了季季有活干，产值有保证。
    碧口地区综合利用野生原料的显著特点是，把工业生产与农村副业生产密切结合起来，彼此促进，共同繁荣。工业需要什么原料，副业就有计划、按需要组织生产或采集什么原料。在综合利用的范围不断扩大中，需要的原料品种愈来愈多，农村副业生产的门路就越来越广。县社工厂在解决原料问题上采取的办法是：大宗的野生纤维、淀粉、竹藤等，由公社按各个厂的计划需要，统一安排，分配各产区的生产队，组织半劳力、附带劳力，成立固定专业队生产或采集；对小宗或零星的野生果实、叶、杆、花、根、野菜，由厂队挂钩，由生产队组织社员利用农间空隙采集；对于季节性特别强的野生油料、淀粉、杂菌等，在夏秋两季组织社员，全民突击，开展“小夏收”和“小秋收”运动；对新发现的原料，各厂把标本发到各生产队，组织社员采集。这些原料统一由商业部门收购，按照计划或厂队签订的合同，统一调拨。现在碧口地区综合利用的野生植物原料达到一百多种，其中今年上半年新增加的有三十多种。这样不仅扩大了副业生产门路，而且也增加了综合利用的花色品种。例如，酒厂原来只生产七、八种酒，今年增加到二十九种，原料供不应求的矛盾反而得到解决。
    碧口地区综合利用野生资源是在不断革命的思想指导下进行的。由于树立了“综合利用没有顶，野生资源挖不尽”的思想，路愈走愈宽。为了做到主要原料都综合利用，各厂确定重点加工的原料，许多厂还在专业车间之外设有综合车间，专门担负试验废品利用，加工新发现的原料，最大限度地提高综合利用率。现在，蕨根、葛根、作合山、龙须草、竹藤、野菜等主要原料都达到了一物多用。每个厂有自己的主要产品和副产品。例如，酒厂原先只能制酒，现在用作合山一种原料烤胶、酿酒（提炼酒精）、制醋、提取饲料，最后剩下的渣滓由土化厂与磷灰石混合，沤制成磷肥，达到五用。综合利用范围扩大后，每百斤作合山的出酒率由原来的30％提高到34％，还增加了接近于酒的价值的二十二斤烤胶和其他三种副产品。野生纤维综合加工厂，用龙须草造棉、织布、制鞋后，每季给国家节省五百二十多丈棉布。今年他们又用当地出产的苦莲籽（有毒的树籽）代替面粉浆线，使制鞋原料除鞋面布外，全部用野生原料代替。只碧口地区综合利用野生原料，去年就给国家节约了二百多万斤粮食，今年生产的各种产品，成本普遍比去年降低20％—40％。
    碧口地区县社工业的职工原来都是农民，其中70％是没有生产技术的妇女。通过两年来的锻炼，五百多名职工中已有70％变成了内行，掌握了工业生产技术，其中30％达到了多面手。
