Xinhua News Agency Report: The workers of the transportation system in the Changchun area of Jilin Province have launched a vigorous campaign to seize every second, not to be short of a single ounce, and to prioritize the transportation of key materials, in support of increased grain and steel production. In the first half of August, the railway department transported a total of 100,600 tons of key materials such as steel, grain, coal, construction materials, agricultural machinery, and chemical fertilizers, exceeding the plan by 5.4%; the highway transportation department transported a total of more than 290,000 tons of key materials, with a freight volume 93.1% higher than the same period last year.

With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, especially the widespread development of the increase production and practice economy movement centered on grain and steel, the freight volume in Jilin Province has been increasing daily. In August, the railway and highway transportation tasks increased by 3.4% and 20% respectively compared to July. In order to ensure the completion of the task of supporting grain and steel production, all transportation departments have universally carried out ideological education for workers on "transportation guarantees key materials, acting as a pioneer." In transportation work, the broad masses of workers conscientiously implement the policy of guaranteeing key materials and taking care of general needs, prioritizing the transportation of steel, grain, and key materials related to grain and steel production. Both the railway and highway departments have established a system of arranging monthly and checking daily the transportation of key materials, giving full play to the role of the transportation "dragon" in great collaboration, and implementing the method of designating specific points, routes, train numbers, and vehicles for the transportation of key materials. The railway transportation department has an average of more than eight "dragon trains" transporting key materials every day, and transported more than 5,000 tons of key materials more than planned in the first half of August. The highway department, centered on the railway station and focusing on key materials, has compiled 110 long and short "dragon trains" such as "Grain Dragon," "Steel Dragon," "Coal Dragon," and "Construction Dragon," putting more than 80% of the transportation vehicles into the transportation of key materials. On the rural short-distance transportation front, in order to ensure the transportation of grain and other key agricultural products, 58 rural roads with a total length of 210 kilometers have also been built and restored.

In the transportation upsurge, all transportation departments and other units have carried forward the spirit of communist collaboration, with people contributing manpower and vehicles contributing transportation capacity. Leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the front line of transportation, playing an important role in promoting the multi-transportation and fast transportation of key materials. Leading cadres of the Changchun Transportation Company have implemented a two-four work system, going to the motorcade for four days a week to work alongside transportation, being responsible for transportation volume, safety, fuel saving, key issues, and ideological work. They have also further promoted the three relocations of dispatch materials and canteens, and the system of management personnel working at the front line, discovering and solving problems in a timely manner, and ensuring the timely transportation of key materials.
