Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 22nd: Bucharest held a grand rally at the State Opera and Ballet Theatre here on the evening of the 22nd to celebrate the sixteenth anniversary of Romania's liberation.

Romanian Workers' Party Central Committee First Secretary Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Romanian Council of Ministers Chairman Chivu Stoica, Great National Assembly Presidium Chairman Maurer and other party and government leaders attended the celebration.

Romanian Workers' Party Central Political Bureau member and Great National Assembly Presidium Chairman Maurer delivered a report on the sixteenth anniversary of Romania's liberation at the meeting.

In his report, Maurer said that Romania has experienced a series of major social changes in the past sixteen years, fundamentally changing the face of the country. Romania today has a strong and constantly developing industry, a socialist-dominated agriculture, and thriving cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings. The Third Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party, which was held not long ago, put forward the task for the future - to thoroughly build socialism in Romania.

Maurer said that Romania's achievements in building socialism are inseparable from the support of the socialist camp countries, especially the assistance from the Soviet Union.

Maurer said that in the task of realizing the grand six-year (1960-1965) plan and fifteen-year long-term plan put forward by the Party, the Romanian working people have already achieved great accomplishments in the first half of this year through selfless labor. He pointed out that in the first half of this year, Romania's total socialist industrial output value overfulfilled by 4%, an increase of 18% compared with the same period last year. Among them, steel production increased by 35%, more than twice the total steel production in 1938; iron ore mining increased by 29% compared with the same period last year; and the total output value of the machinery manufacturing industry increased by 28%. At the same time, the daily necessities industry has also greatly increased compared with the same period last year. In the socialist transformation of agriculture, major achievements have also been made in the first half of this year. As of August 1, the proportion of socialist agriculture has accounted for 83%. Due to the development of industry, there has also been great progress in agricultural mechanization. The number of new tractors added to the agricultural sector in the first half of this year was 50% more than in the same period last year.

He said that in completing the plans formulated by the Party, the broad masses of intellectuals have also made great efforts and made valuable contributions to the prosperity of the motherland's culture and science.

Maurer said that the achievements we have made under the leadership of the Party prove the realism and scientific nature of the plans formulated by the Party. He said that with the people educated by our Party and tempered in the flames of struggle, we can move mountains and fill seas. The Romanian working people are determined to unite closely around the Party and thoroughly complete the socialist construction of Romania.

In his report, Maurer talked about Romania's foreign policy, saying that the Romanian government firmly implements the policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems in its foreign policy. He condemned the Western countries for obstructing disarmament. He said that the development of international events proves that the imperialist aggressive groups are afraid of the international situation moving towards détente and are trying their best to prevent détente and create tension. He said that Romania actively supports the national liberation movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 23rd: A grand military parade and mass parade were held in Stalin Square in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, this morning to celebrate the sixteenth anniversary of Romania's liberation.

Romanian Workers' Party and state leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chivu Stoica, and Maurer reviewed the armed forces and the parade.

At eight o'clock in the morning, Romanian Armed Forces Minister Salajan made a speech before the start of the parade. He said: Under the leadership of the Party, the working people of our country have made great achievements in all sectors of socialist construction. These achievements are inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union and the mutual assistance and cooperation with other socialist countries.

He said that the basis of Romania's foreign policy is solidarity and friendship with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Romania advocates peaceful solutions to all international disputes, advocates complete and thorough disarmament, and the implementation of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. He said that we must not forget the imperialist groups' continued policy of aggression and opposition to peace and détente in the international situation. Romania is determined to maintain vigilance against the imperialist aggressive groups and to fight for the defense of world peace.

After the artillery salute, the military parade began, and infantry, navy, artillery, and tank units successively passed in front of the reviewing stand. Powerful jet aircraft also flew over the reviewing stand. Then, five thousand workers' self-defense forces marched in front of the reviewing stand with full arms. They are a powerful force for defending socialist Romania.

At nine o'clock sharp, the mass parade began. Leading the procession were thousands of Young Pioneers, holding sickles, hammers, books, and set squares; this symbolizes the combination of education and labor. The workers who are victoriously realizing the tasks put forward by the Workers' Party "Third Congress" passed through the square with production charts and product models. At the end of the parade was a strong sports contingent. The military parade and parade lasted for more than four hours. (Attached picture)

    庆祝罗马尼亚解放十六周年
    布加勒斯特举行盛大集会和群众游行
    新华社布加勒斯特22日电　布加勒斯特各界22日晚上在这里的国家歌舞剧院举行盛大集会，庆祝罗马尼亚解放十六周年。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治、罗马尼亚部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡、大国民议会主席团主席毛雷尔等党政领导人出席了庆祝大会。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央政治局委员、大国民议会主席团主席毛雷尔在会上作了关于罗马尼亚解放十六周年的报告。
    毛雷尔在报告中说，十六年来，罗马尼亚经历了一系列重大的社会变革，根本地改变了国家的面貌。罗马尼亚今天已经具备了不断发展的强大的工业、社会主义占优势的农业和欣欣向荣的文教、科学事业。不久前召开的罗马尼亚工人党第三次代表大会提出了今后的任务——在罗马尼亚彻底建成社会主义。
    毛雷尔说，罗马尼亚在建设社会主义中所取得的成就，是与社会主义阵营国家的支持，尤其是与苏联的援助分不开的。
    毛雷尔说，在实现党提出的宏伟的六年（1960—1965年）计划和十五年远景规划的任务中，罗马尼亚劳动人民在今年上半年通过忘我的劳动已经取得了巨大的成就。他指出，今年上半年，罗马尼亚社会主义工业总产值超额完成4％，比去年同期增长了18％。其中，钢产量增长了35％，比1938年全年的钢产量多两倍；铁矿石开采量比去年同期增长了29％；机器制造工业总产值增长了28％。同时，日用品工业也比去年同期有了巨大的增长。在农业的社会主义改造中，今年上半年也取得了重大的成就。到8月1日为止，社会主义农业的比重已占83％。由于工业的发展，农业机械化也有了巨大的进展。今年上半年农业部门新增加的拖拉机比去年同期多50％。
    他说，在完成党制订的计划中，广大的知识分子也作出了巨大的努力，为繁荣祖国的文化科学作出了宝贵的贡献。
    毛雷尔说，我们在党领导下所取得的成就，证明了党所制定的计划的现实性和科学性。他说，有我们党所教育出来的在斗争的烈火中锻炼出来的人民，我们就能够移山填海。罗马尼亚的劳动人民决心紧密地团结在党的周围，彻底完成罗马尼亚的社会主义建设。
    毛雷尔在报告中谈到罗马尼亚的外交政策时说，罗马尼亚政府在外交政策中坚定地执行不同社会制度国家和平共处的政策。他谴责了西方国家阻挠裁军。他说，国际事件的发展证明，帝国主义侵略集团害怕国际局势走向缓和，竭力企图阻止缓和，制造紧张局势。他说，罗马尼亚积极地支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族解放运动。
    新华社布加勒斯特23日电　罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特今日上午在斯大林广场举行了盛大的阅兵和群众游行，庆祝罗马尼亚解放十六周年。
    罗马尼亚工人党和国家领导人乔治乌—德治、基伏·斯托伊卡和毛雷尔等检阅了武装部队和游行队伍。
    上午八时，罗马尼亚武装部队部部长萨拉扬大将在阅兵开始前讲了话。他说：我国劳动人民在党的领导下，在社会主义建设的各个部门都取得了巨大的成就。这些成就是与苏联的援助以及同其它社会主义国家的互助合作分不开的。
    他说，罗马尼亚外交政策的基础是与苏联及其它社会主义国家的团结和友好。罗马尼亚主张和平解决一切国际纠纷问题，主张全面彻底裁军和实行不同社会制度国家间的和平共处。他说，不能忘记帝国主义集团继续侵略和反对和平和缓和国际局势的政策。罗马尼亚决心保持着对帝国主义侵略集团的警惕，为维护世界和平而斗争。
    在鸣放礼炮后，阅兵式开始，步兵、海军、炮兵、坦克部队相继走过检阅台前面。强大的喷气机群也飞过检阅台的上空。接着，五千名工人自卫队带着全副武装在检阅台前面走过。他们是保卫社会主义罗马尼亚的强大力量。
    九时整，群众游行开始。走在队伍前面的是数千名少先队员，他们举着镰刀、铁锤、书本和三角尺；这象征着教育与劳动相结合。胜利地实现着工人党“三大”提出的任务的工人们，带着生产图表和产品模型浩浩荡荡地通过广场。走在游行队伍最后面的是健壮的体育大队。阅兵和游行共进行了四个多小时。（附图片）
