    Clear Daily and Monthly Accounts, Save Every Thread, Adhere to Financial Systems
    Xu Chunhua, Accountant of Yuanshi Brigade, Yiqiao Commune, Jishui County, is Impartial, Handles Finances Skillfully

    (Our report) Nanchang, Jiangxi – Xu Chunhua, the accountant and Communist Party member of Yuanshi Brigade, Yiqiao Commune, Jishui County, Jiangxi Province, has diligently and conscientiously managed the finances for the commune members for six years, earning the love and praise of all the brigade members. He has been repeatedly recognized as an advanced worker.

    Before liberation, Xu Chunhua's family was poor and couldn't afford schooling, so he was illiterate. After several literacy campaigns after liberation, he shed his illiteracy. In 1955, when the agricultural production cooperative was established, he was elected as the accountant by the masses because he was active in labor, handled matters impartially, and had some education. Because he had only recently overcome illiteracy, his educational level was still very low, and Xu Chunhua encountered many difficulties after becoming an accountant. At first, he was afraid of making mistakes in the accounts, and that others would gossip, so he wanted to quit being an accountant. However, under the education and encouragement of the Party branch, Xu Chunhua understood that managing the finances of nearly two hundred commune members played a huge role in promoting production and consolidating the agricultural cooperative. Therefore, he quickly settled down and resolved to do a good job in accounting. At that time, there were dozens of types of account books and forms in the agricultural cooperative, making bookkeeping difficult. So, Xu Chunhua took Chen Longzuo, an accountant from a neighboring village, as his teacher to learn bookkeeping methods. He also took Deng Jiusheng, an old commune member, as his teacher to learn the abacus methods of "nine-nine rules" and "jin seeking liang." In the spring of 1956, the higher authorities issued a fund for poor peasant cooperatives, and Xu Chunhua did not know how to account for it. So, he ran to neighboring village agricultural cooperatives to ask for advice. He ran to the east village and the west village, and after asking several accountants, he still couldn't figure it out. So he crossed mountains and ridges and ran thirty miles to the county seat to find the guidance accountant, Liu Zhusheng, to learn, and finally completed the accounting for this fund, so that the fund was used reasonably.

    "How much income did the team have this year? How many work points did I earn? How much cash can I get at the end of the year?" Xu Chunhua deeply realized in his work that these questions must be clearly explained to the commune members in a timely manner. Therefore, Xu Chunhua always kept the accounts clear on a daily and monthly basis, and regularly announced various financial matters so that commune members knew all the details. If commune members had any questions, he would answer them patiently. If they didn't understand once, he would explain it again until the commune members fully understood. In order to make the accounts clear and error-free, Xu Chunhua always adhered to three procedures when recording accounts: first, recording the issuance slip; second, recording the journal entry; and third, recording the general ledger after verifying that there were no errors. He also often went to the commune members' homes to reconcile the accounts with them, and encouraged the commune members to care about their own accounts, welcoming them to come to the brigade at any time to check their accounts. Because Xu Chunhua cared about the masses everywhere in his work, relied on the masses in everything, and listened humbly to the opinions of the masses, every commune member regarded managing finances as their own business, so that the various accounts of Yuanshi Brigade have been error-free for six years.

    The team's money is the commune members' sweat, and we should save every penny if we can, and resolutely not spend it if it is not necessary. Xu Chunhua, who came from a poor peasant background, has insisted on doing this since he became an accountant. In recent years, when the brigade wanted to buy some office supplies, he always considered it again and again, trying to buy nothing or buy less, and save the money for production. The account books he uses are all bound from waste paper. The office tables and chairs are also repaired from old and broken tables and chairs. Last winter, due to work needs, the leadership asked him to buy a new desk. He went to the county seat to inquire, and the worst desk cost more than twenty yuan. So, he personally ran to the mountains to cut down two trees and asked a carpenter to make him a desk. He said: "To greatly develop production, we need sufficient funds, and we must save every thread." In recent years, due to Xu Chunhua's tight control, the administrative management expenses of this brigade have never exceeded three-thousandths of the total income, saving half of the prescribed target every year.

    For six years, Xu Chunhua has always meticulously implemented financial and economic systems, and has always led by example. He has never used a penny of the brigade's money for his own personal affairs. He has attended dozens of meetings in the county and district, always walking on foot, and has never reimbursed the brigade for travel expenses. Whether it is a commune member or a cadre who borrows money, Xu Chunhua insists on handling matters according to the system. Without certain approval procedures, no loans are given. Everyone says that Xu Chunhua is selfless and impartial in handling affairs. Under the education of the Party and the influence of Xu Chunhua, no cadre in Yuanshi Brigade has misappropriated a penny of the brigade's money in the past six years, and they have all developed a good style of loving the community as their home and being honest and impartial.

    账目日清月结　节约一针一线　坚持财务制度
    吉水县医桥公社元石大队会计许春华办事公正理财有方
    本报讯　江西吉水县医桥公社元石大队会计、共产党员许春华，六年如一日，勤勤恳恳、踏踏实实为社员管好财务，受到了全大队社员的爱戴和赞扬。他曾多次被评为先进工作者。
    解放前，许春华家贫无钱读书，只字不识，解放后经过几次扫盲运动，才摘掉文盲帽子。1955年成立农业生产合作社时，他因为劳动积极，办事公正，又有点文化，被群众选为会计。由于摘掉文盲帽子不久，文化水平还很低，许春华担任会计后遇到很多困难。开始他怕搞错账，别人会说“闲话”，想不当会计。但在党支部的教育和鼓励下，许春华懂得了管好近两百户社员的财务，对促进生产和巩固农业社有着巨大作用，因此很快安定下来，决心搞好会计工作。当时，农业社的账簿表格有几十种，很不好作账。于是，许春华便拜邻村会计陈龙佐为师，学习记账方法。他还拜老社员邓九生为师，向他学习“九九规”、“斤求两”的珠算法。1956年春，上级发下一笔贫农合作基金，许春华不知如何作账，便跑到邻村农业社去请教。他跑了东村跑西村，一连问了几个会计，都没有搞清楚。于是他就翻山越岭跑了三十里路，到县城，去找辅导会计刘竹生学习，终于做好了这笔账，使这批基金得到了合理使用。
    “今年队里有多少收入？自己作了多少工分？年终能分得多少现金？”许春华在工作中，深深地体会到，这些问题都必须及时向社员作出清楚的交代。因此，许春华管账目总是日清月结，定期公布各种账务，让社员知道全部底细。社员如有疑问，他就耐心解答，一次不懂，再讲一次，直到社员完全弄明白为止。为使账目清楚，不出差错，许春华在记账时，始终坚持三道手续：第一道记发单，第二道记日记账，第三道核算不错以后，再记总账。他还经常到社员家里去，和社员核对账目，并鼓励社员关心自己的账务，欢迎他们随时到大队来检查自己的账目。由于许春华在工作中处处关心群众，事事依靠群众，虚心倾听群众的意见，因此，每个社员也都把管好财务当做自己的事，使得元石大队各项账目，六年来无一差错。
    大队的钱，是社员的汗，能省一文就省一文，不必开支的就坚决不开支。贫农出身的许春华，担任会计以来，一直坚持这样做。几年来，大队要买些办公用具，他总是考虑又考虑，尽量做到不买或少买，把钱省下来用到生产上去。他所用的账簿，都是用废纸装订成的。办公桌椅，也都是用旧桌破椅修理的。去年冬天，由于工作需要，领导上叫他买一张新的桌子，他到县城一打听，最差的办公桌也得二十多元。于是，他亲自跑到山上砍回两株树，请木匠给他做了张办公桌。他说：“生产要大发展，就需要有充足的资金，一针一线都要节约。”几年来，这个大队的行政管理费用，由于许春华卡的紧，从没有超过总收入的千分之三，按规定指标每年节约一半。
    六年来，许春华始终一丝不苟地执行财经制度，处处以身作则。他从未因自己的私事，用过大队一分钱。他到县里区里开过几十次会，总是两脚步行，从未向大队报销过一次旅差费。社员、干部借支钱，无论是谁，许春华都坚持按制度办事。不经过一定的审批手续，概不出借。大家都说许春华铁面无私、办事公正。在党的教育和许春华的影响下，六年来元石大队干部无人挪用过大队一分钱，都养成了爱社如家、廉洁奉公的良好作风。
