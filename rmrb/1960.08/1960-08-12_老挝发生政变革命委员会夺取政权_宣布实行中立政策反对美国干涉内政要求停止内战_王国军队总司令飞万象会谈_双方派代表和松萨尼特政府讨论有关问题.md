Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th – According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio, the Revolutionary Committee, led by Captain Kong Le, commander of the original 2nd Paratroop Battalion of Laos, seized power at 3:00 AM on the 9th. The Revolutionary Committee announced that it opposes foreign interference in Lao internal affairs, demands the expulsion of foreign troops from Laos and the abolition of foreign military bases in Laos, an end to the civil war, and reform of government institutions.

The Revolutionary Committee issued a series of communiqués through the radio, announcing the Revolutionary Committee’s domestic and foreign policies. The communiqués stated that, domestically, the Revolutionary Committee opposes bribery and corruption and seeks to reform the National Assembly and the government. In the military, the Revolutionary Committee will oppose foreign interference and expel foreign troops from Laos. In foreign affairs, the Revolutionary Committee respects the United Nations Charter, pursues a neutral policy, and actively establishes friendly and good neighborly relations with countries willing to establish good relations with Laos, respecting agreements already signed by Laos. Economically, the Revolutionary Committee will develop agriculture and industry to improve the people's livelihood and will accept aid from all countries without political conditions.

The Revolutionary Committee also issued a proclamation to the people, saying, "The reason we are carrying out the revolution is because we hope the country will quickly achieve peace, stop the mutual killing among Lao people, eliminate the evils of bribery, investigate officers and employees whose assets are higher than their wages, immediately abolish foreign military bases in Laos, and oppose foreign interference."

The proclamation to the people stated that the interference of foreign powers such as the United States in Laos is deepening. There are permanent Americans everywhere. Even in our battalion (the 2nd Paratroop Battalion), there are ten Americans, and these people are allowed by the government to interfere in our affairs. Other battalions and other places have as many or more Americans. The proclamation to the people hopes that the Lao people will recognize that the United States is the one who designated Phoui Sananikone's government and army commanders, and that these people are the ones who are creating the civil war.

In another message broadcast through Vientiane Radio to all sectors of the Lao people, the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, Kong Le, also accused the Phoui Sananikone government of selling out the motherland and the people, causing a civil war. The message said, "Those who make up the current government are not Lao people; they have been bought to act as lackeys of the United States."

According to a report from Vientiane by an Agence France-Presse reporter, soldiers of the 2nd Paratroop Battalion, commanded by Captain Kong Le, occupied various strategic locations when they seized power, including the airport, administrative office buildings, post offices, radio stations, and important departments in the city. Subsequently, they controlled the entire city. At that time, Defense Minister Phoumi Nosavan of the Phoui Sananikone government and other leaders of the Royal Lao Army were far away in Luang Prabang.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th – According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio, the Revolutionary Committee, which seized power in Laos on the 9th, established a provisional executive committee in Vientiane on the 9th.

Under the provisional executive committee, headed by Captain Kong Le, commander of the 2nd Paratroop Battalion, there were also established subcommittees for domestic and foreign politics, finance and economics, security, transportation and public works, health and welfare, propaganda, postal and telecommunications, and liaison.

It was announced that the members of the subcommittee for domestic and foreign politics, in addition to Captain Kong Le, also include Prince Souvanna Phouma, Speaker of the National Assembly of Laos, and Quinim Pholsena, Chairman of the Lao Committee for Supporting Peace and Neutrality.

On the 10th, General Ouane Rattikone, Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Lao Army, flew from Luang Prabang, where the King of Laos and most members of the Phoui Sananikone government were located, to Vientiane to hold talks with members of the Revolutionary Committee.

According to a joint statement broadcast by Vientiane Radio this afternoon by the Revolutionary Committee, Standing Committee of the National Assembly, and General Staff Headquarters of the Royal Army, they unanimously decided after the talks that representatives from the General Staff Headquarters, General Ouane Rattikone, representatives from the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, Chao Somsanith (advisor to the Lao People’s Union – editor’s note), and representatives from the Revolutionary Committee, Brigadier General Sing Ratrasamay, would go to Luang Prabang on the afternoon of the 11th to discuss relevant issues with the Phoui Sananikone government and requested all members of the Sananikone cabinet and members of the provincial councils to immediately go to Vientiane.

On the afternoon of the 11th, at a rally convened by the Revolutionary Committee, the Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, Captain Kong Le, announced again that the Revolutionary Committee, after discussing with representatives from the General Staff Headquarters and the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, unanimously decided to nominate Prince Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister of the revolutionary government. According to him, the Revolutionary Committee sent representatives to invite the Phoui Sananikone government back to discuss his resignation. In his speech, Captain Kong Le expressed his determination to fight for the peace, neutrality, freedom, and prosperity of Laos.

As the representatives of the Lao Revolutionary Committee were preparing to go to Luang Prabang, according to a Reuters report, Lao Ambassador to Thailand Khamphan said in Bangkok today that the Phoui Sananikone government had established a headquarters in Luang Prabang and was taking action to "recover" Vientiane from the "rebels." He said that some ministers of the Phoui Sananikone government had gone to some provinces in southern Laos in an attempt to gather "troops loyal to the Phoui Sananikone government" to "prepare to take drastic action."

News indicates that the United States and members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), which is controlled by the United States, are extremely uneasy about the situation in Laos.

When asked about the situation in Laos at a press conference on the 10th, US President Eisenhower said that he had been trying to get some real information about the situation in Laos for about thirty hours. He said he "cannot answer" until he gets "some clarification."

At the same time, according to SEATO Secretary-General Sarasin, the member states of this aggressive group have held emergency consultations on the situation in Laos, and the Thai cabinet held an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in Laos. There is news that the Thai army is in a state of combat readiness.

Currently, Phoumi Nosavan, the defense minister of the Phoui Sananikone government, which is known for being extremely pro-American, has arrived in Thailand. According to Thai Deputy Interior Minister Luang Chartrakarn Kosol, the Thai government has allowed Nosavan and his ten escorts to go to Bangkok.

    王国军队总司令飞万象会谈　双方派代表和松萨尼特政府讨论有关问题
    新华社河内11日电　据万象电台广播，由原老挝伞兵第二营指挥官贡勒大尉所领导的革命委员会在9日早晨三时夺取了政权。革命委员会宣布，它反对外国干涉老挝内政，要求把外国军队赶出老挝和撤消外国在老挝的军事基地，停止内战，改革政府机构。
    革命委员会通过电台发布了一系列的公报，宣布了革命委员会的对内对外政策。公报说，对内方面，革命委员会反对行贿弊病，要革新国会和政府。军队方面，革命委员会将反对外国的干涉，把外国军队赶出老挝。对外方面，革命委员会尊重联合国宪章，实行中立政策，并积极同愿意与老挝建立良好关系的国家建立友好和睦邻关系，尊重老挝已经签订的协定。经济方面，革命委员会将发展农业和工业来提高人民的生活，并将接受不附带政治条件的所有国家的援助。
    革命委员会还发表告人民书说，“我们所以进行革命是因为我们希望国家迅速获得安宁，制止老挝人之间的互相残杀，取消行贿的弊病，检查资产比他们的工资还高的军官和职员，立即取消外国在老挝的军事基地，反对外国的干涉。”
    告人民书说，外国强国例如美国对老挝的干涉日益加深。到处都有常驻的美国人。就在我们营里（伞兵第二营）也有十个美国人，这些人是政府允许他们干涉我们的事务的。其他的营和其他地方也有这样多或者更多的美国人。告人民书希望老挝人民认清美国是指定昭·松萨尼特政府和军队指挥官的人，而这些人正是制造内战的人。
    革命委员会主席贡勒在通过万象电台向老挝各阶层人民广播的另一项文告中，还指责昭·松萨尼特政府出卖祖国和人民，造成内战。这项文告说，“组成现政府的那些人不是老挝人了，他们已经被收买来充当美国的奴才了。”
    据法新社记者自万象报道，贡勒大尉指挥的伞兵第二营士兵在夺取政权时，占领了各个战略地点，其中包括机场，市内各行政办公楼、邮局、广播电台和重要部门。随后控制了全市。在当时，昭·松萨尼特政府的国防大臣富米·诺萨万和其他老挝王国军队的领导人都远在琅勃拉邦。
    新华社河内11日电　据万象电台广播，9日夺取了老挝政权的革命委员会在9日已经在万象成立了一个临时执行委员会。
    在以伞兵第二营指挥官贡勒大尉为首的临时执行委员会下又设立了对内对外政治、财经、安全、交通和公共工程、卫生和福利、宣传、邮电、联络等各小组委员会。
    据宣布，在对内对外政治小组委员会成员中除了贡勒大尉以外，还包括老挝国民议会议长梭发那·富马亲王，老挝拥护和平中立政策委员会主席贵宁·奔舍那等。
    10日，老挝王国军队总司令万·拉迪功从老挝国王和昭·松萨尼特政府大部分成员所在地的琅勃拉邦乘飞机到达万象，与革命委员会成员会谈。
    据万象电台今天下午广播的革命委员会、国民议会常务委员会和王国军队总参谋部的一则联合声明说，它们在会谈后一致决定，由总参谋部代表万·拉迪功——国民议会常务委员会代表昭苏·波冯（老挝人联合党顾问——编者注）、革命委员会代表星准将等人在11日下午前往琅勃拉邦，同昭·松萨尼特政府讨论有关问题，并请松萨尼特内阁全体阁员和各省议员立即到万象。
    11日下午，在革命委员会召集的一个集会上，革命委员会主席贡勒大尉又宣布，革命委员会在同总参谋部、国民议会常务委员会代表讨论以后，一致决定提名富马亲王为革命政府首相。据他说，革命委员会派代表去邀请昭·松萨尼特政府回来是为商讨他辞职的问题。贡勒大尉在讲话中表示要为老挝的和平、中立、自由和繁荣而奋斗。
    当老挝革命委员会的代表等准备前往琅勃拉邦之际，据路透社消息，老挝驻泰国大使康潘今天在曼谷说，昭·松萨尼特政府已经在琅勃拉邦成立了总部，正在采取行动来从“叛军”手中“收复”万象。他说，昭·松萨尼特政府的一些大臣已经前往老挝南部一些省份，企图集结“忠于昭·松萨尼特政府的部队”，“准备采取激烈的行动”。
    消息表明，美国和美国操纵的东南亚侵略集团成员对老挝的局势极感不安。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔10日在记者招待会被问到老挝局势时说，约有三十个小时他一直在设法得到关于老挝局势的某些真实的情况。他表示在得到“某种澄清”以前“不能作出回答”。
    同时，据东南亚条约组织秘书长沙拉信透露，这个侵略集团的成员国就老挝局势进行了紧急磋商，泰国内阁举行了紧急会议来讨论老挝局势。有消息说，泰国军队已处于战斗准备状态。
    目前，以极端亲美著称的昭·松萨尼特政府的国防大臣富米·诺萨万已经到达泰国。据泰国内政部副部长銮乍特拉堪·科索今天宣布，泰国政府已经允许诺萨万和他的十名随行人员到曼谷。
