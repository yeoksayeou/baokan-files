The Party Nurtured Me to Become an Actress

	I am a young actress in the Guangdong Chao Opera, having performed for only seven or eight years. I joined the troupe in 1953; at the time, I didn't understand anything, I just liked Chaozhou opera. People said I had the potential to be an actress, and my family was very poor, needing me to come out and work to alleviate the burden. Under the persuasion of the troupe leader, I joined the opera troupe and embarked on the path of happiness that the Party had arranged for us young people. Over the past seven or eight years, some have said that my growth has two characteristics: one is that the Party put in a lot of effort, and the other is that it has been very smooth. I think they are right. Others say that we are the first generation of artists cultivated in the socialist era. This title gives me great inspiration and impetus, giving me unlimited strength and making me feel honored.

	I deeply feel that I was nurtured and grew up by the Party. My every achievement was obtained under the guidance of the correct principles of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and "Bringing forth the new from the old," and in the achievements of socialism.

	In the early days of joining the troupe, I verbally followed everyone else in saying that performing was to serve the people. In reality, I did not truly understand its meaning. Under the Party's continuous education and our troupe's firm implementation of the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, I slowly realized that I was not an artist like those in the old society, and that artistic work was not a matter of personal entertainment. Once, our troupe went to a factory to offer our condolences, and the workers there said, "You are sent by the Party!" This sentence made me understand that performing is also part of the Party's cause, not personal. In 1957, the Rightists attacked us, vociferously opposing the Party's leadership and opposing performing modern plays. I then further understood the bourgeoisie's intentions to try every possible means to seize this position, and understood that performing could not follow the capitalist path, only the path of workers, peasants, and soldiers was the correct one. Later, we went to the front lines in Fujian to offer our condolences to the People's Liberation Army, to the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory and Sugar Refinery to offer our condolences to the workers, and to the Chenqiao Brigade of the Chaoan Fengxi Commune to offer our condolences to the farmers. The responsible comrade of the People's Liberation Army introduced us to the situation of the struggle against the enemy and took us to visit the lives of the soldiers on the coastal islands on the front lines of national defense, which made me further understand the greatness of our People's Liberation Army. At the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, I heard workers talk about how they created motors that countries all over the world couldn't do under simple conditions; at the Sugar Refinery, I also went to learn how to wrap sugar, but the sisters there wrapped more than four hundred candies in five minutes, while I only wrapped nineteen in five minutes, which made me feel that the power of the workers was great. In the Chenqiao Brigade, I saw the farmers' own creation of hydroelectric power steam stoves, so that everyone in the team could eat hot meals and take hot baths, and I also felt that they were not simple. In short, since liberation, I have seen the achievements made by workers, peasants, and soldiers for the socialist revolution and socialist construction, seen the wealth they have created for the country and the people, and seen my own living standards improve day by day, which made me understand that I must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Over the past few years, in order to help us actors improve our political consciousness, the Party has asked the local Party committees to give us political reports when performing in various places, let us meet with advanced figures, visit advanced units, and participate in various meetings that we could participate in, so that I could get a faster improvement in politics and gloriously become a daughter of the Party. In these seven or eight years, under the Party's cultivation and education, I have become a little soldier in the proletarian literary and artistic ranks from unconsciously to consciously. Under the Party's teachings, I understand that I am first and foremost a Party member, and the life of a Party member is to carry out the Party's tasks and serve as a bridge between the Party and the masses, and to play a leading role and a backbone role among the masses. I feel that the Party's cultivation of me exceeds my contribution, so I often tell myself that I must not fail the Party's education, no matter what difficulties I encounter, I should not retreat, and I must strive to do the work assigned by the Party well.

	I went from not knowing how to perform to being able to perform entirely because of the Party's multi-faceted cultivation of me in business. The troupe educated me from six aspects: first, teaching me to learn the main play; second, participating in short-term basic training; third, arranging for me to learn from brother opera genres; fourth, comrades care for and help me; fifth, inviting teachers and experts to teach me; sixth, combining with new literary and artistic work. Over the past eight years, I have passed four barriers in performing arts. The first barrier was when I first joined the troupe, I didn't understand anything, I could only sing a few ditties, so the Party used the method of rehearsing the main play to help me pass the barrier, and specially invited a teacher from the Qingyi line to teach me the main play. The two teachers spent half a year rehearsing "Sweeping the Window" for me, so that I basically mastered the movements of Qingyi. After learning for half a year, I went on stage to perform; because I learned a play, I had more opportunities to perform on stage, and there was more stage practice. In the time of detailed rehearsal of the main play, the teacher also asked me to help sing, every night at the side of the curtain, watching others perform, listening to music, learning percussion, and helping to sing. Therefore, although half a year was short, I was relatively familiar with the stage. Because I learned percussion, I also understood the basic musical rhythm of Chao opera.

	The second barrier in my art was performing "Chen San Wu Niang." "Chen San Wu Niang" is a large play, and the character of Wu Niang is fundamentally different from the character of Wang Jinzhen in "Sweeping the Window." Wu Niang is a maiden who has not left her boudoir, courageously pursuing freedom. She does not have the tragic color of Wang Jinzhen. Therefore, it requires me to create another new character. This was difficult for me. In order for me to learn this play well, the Party arranged for me to study in Fujian Liyuan Opera, so that I received the help of the Liyuan Opera teachers and completed the creation of this character. The third barrier in my art was to have me play the Red Army mother Li Liying in the modern play "Evergreen Pine and Cypress." This character required me to jump from a virtuous wife and good mother Wang Jinzhen in the feudal era to a revolutionary mother - an old Red Army fighter, which was really very difficult for me. The first time I rehearsed, I only imitated some of the movements of the opera Lao Dan, and did not understand the revolutionary qualities of Li Liying at all. So the characters that came out were old and weak in character. How did I break through this barrier? How could I, a girl without revolutionary experience, create the image of a great revolutionary mother? At this time, it was the Party that helped me, and once again arranged for me to go to the home of Comrade Li Liying, live with her, and earnestly learn her noble revolutionary qualities. In this period of life, she often used her revolutionary experience to educate and infect me, so that I truly learned some of the qualities and demeanor of Comrade Li Liying, and was able to create a great image of a revolutionary mother with a bit of "revolutionary energy." The fourth barrier in my art was to have me play Chen Biniang in "Cilang Island." Chen Biniang is a female poet and a national hero who can lead troops. My historical knowledge is very poor, and I don't know martial arts; when the Party gave me the task of creating this character, I really didn't dare to accept it. Because I felt that this was a problem of acting, because I learned Qingyi, but now I want me to play Wudan, I don't know how to play it. When the Party knew that I had this idea, it encouraged me to give play to the spirit of daring to think and daring to do, and asked me to bravely break the boundaries of acting. It invited a Beijing Opera martial arts teacher for me, and mobilized all the martial arts comrades in the troupe to form a group to help me. Under the Party's encouragement, I felt that it was impossible not to work hard. On the one hand, I studied desperately, and on the other hand, I had comrades to help me when I encountered difficulties, so I became bolder. For example, when I performed Chen Biniang cutting Zhang Hongfan three times, it was always difficult to rehearse well, so the Party mobilized all the comrades who knew martial arts, divided them into several groups, and everyone gave play to their abilities, creating various different cutting methods, and then combined them, choosing the good ones and blending them together, and the difficulty of cutting three times was solved. In the adaptation and re-rehearsal of "Cilang Island," because the script was changed more than a dozen times, and the performance was moved every time, the progress was slow, so the Party mobilized all the artists to use the method of big-character posters to collectively think of ways, and once one night, thousands of big-character posters were posted, contributing more than two thousand opinions on modification and re-rehearsal, which improved the play.

	Over the past eight years, the Party has arranged for new literary and artistic workers to work in the troupe. They are a force for the innovation of our Chao opera, and they have given us great guidance in theory and performance. I deeply feel that because of the Party's leadership and the appeal of the communist style, experts, the masses, and comrades from brother opera genres have given me such selfless help. Even doctors, drivers, and shop service personnel enthusiastically support me, so that I have made progress today. Therefore, it is absolutely true that people say that I am the first generation of actors cultivated by the Party. Without the Party and without socialism, I would not have become an actor who can serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

### 党抚育我成为演员

    党抚育我成为演员	姚璇秋
    我是广东省潮剧的青年演员，只演了七、八年戏。1953年，我才参加剧团；当时我甚么也不懂，只是喜欢潮州戏。人家说我有条件做演员，同时我家很贫穷，需要我出来做事减轻负担，我便在剧团负责人的劝导下参加到戏曲队伍中来，踏上了党为我们青年人所安排的幸福的道路。七、八年来，有人说我的成长有两个特点，一个是党花了很大的工夫，一个是一路很顺当。我觉得说得很对。又有人说我们是社会主义时代培养出来的第一代艺人，这个称呼，给我很大的启发和鞭策，给我无限的力量，使我感到光荣。
    我深深地感觉到，我是党抚育长大的。我的一点一滴的成就，都是在为工农兵服务，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”、“推陈出新”的正确方针的指导下，和社会主义成就中获得的。
    进剧团初期，我口头上虽然跟着大家一样说：做戏是为人民服务的。实际上我并没有真正懂得它的意义。在党的不断教育和我们剧团坚决贯彻为工农兵服务的方针下，我才慢慢地领会到，我不是旧社会那样的艺人，文艺工作也不是个人消遣的事。有一次，我们剧团到工厂去慰问，那里的工人说：“你们是党派来的！”这句话使我明白了演戏也是党的事业的一部分，不是个人的。1957年，右派向我们进攻，口口声声反对党的领导，反对演现代戏，我才又进一步明白了资产阶级千方百计要抢夺这个阵地的用心，明白演戏是不能走资产阶级的道路的，只有走工农兵方向才是正确的。后来，我们又到福建前线去慰问解放军，到上海电机厂、制糖厂去慰问工人，到潮安枫溪公社陈桥大队去慰问农民。解放军负责同志向我们介绍了对敌斗争的情况，带我们参观了海防前沿海岛上战士们的生活，使我进一步明白我们的解放军的伟大。在上海电机厂听到工人讲他们在简单的条件下，怎样创造了世界各国做不到的电机；在制糖厂，我也去学包糖，可是那里的姊妹们五分钟包了四百多粒糖果，而我五分钟只包了十九粒，使我感觉到工人的力量很大。在陈桥大队，我看到农民自己创造的水力发电蒸汽灶，使全队的人都能吃热饭，洗热水澡，我也觉得他们是不简单的。总之，解放以来，我看到工农兵为社会主义革命、社会主义建设所做出的成绩，看到他们为国家人民创造出来的财富，看到自己一天一天提高的生活水平，使我明白了必须为工农兵服务。几年来，党为了帮助我们演员提高政治觉悟，在各地演出时请当地的党委为我们做政治报告，让我们与先进人物见面，参观先进单位，参加各种可能参加的会议，使我在政治上得到更快的提高，光荣地成为党的女儿。这七、八年来，在党的培养教育下，使我从不自觉到自觉地当起一名无产阶级文艺队伍中的小兵。在党的教导下，我懂得我首先是个党员，党员的生命是为执行党的任务，做党和群众间的桥梁，要在群众中起带头作用、骨干作用。我感到党对我的培养超过我的贡献，因此我常常告诉自己，要不辜负党的教育，无论碰到甚么困难，都不应该退下来，一定要努力坚持做好党分配的工作。
    我从不会演戏到会演戏，完全是由于党对我在业务上多方面的培养。剧团从六方面来教育我：一是教我学会首本戏；二是参加短期基本训练；三、安排我向兄弟剧种学习；四、同志们都关心我、帮助我；五、请老师专家教我；六、与新文艺工作结合。八年来，我在表演艺术上过了四个关。第一关是初入团时，我甚么也不懂，只会唱几句小曲，党便用熟排首本戏的方法来送我过关，特为我请了青衣行的老师，专门教给我首本戏。两位老师用半年的时间给我排《扫窗会》，使我基本上掌握了青衣的动作。学了半年我便上台演出；因为学会了一出戏，我便有了较多的上台机会，舞台实践就多些。在细排首本戏的时间，老师又叫我帮腔，每晚都在幕边，边看别人演出，边听音乐，边学打击乐，边帮腔。因此，半年时间虽然短，但我对于舞台比较熟悉了。因为学会了打击乐，便也懂得了潮剧的基本曲牌节奏。
    我在艺术上的第二关是演《陈三五娘》。《陈三五娘》是大戏，而且五娘这个角色的性格和《扫窗会》中王金真的性格根本不同。五娘是个未出闺阁，勇敢的追求自由的少女。她没有王金真那样带有悲剧色彩。因此它要求我进行另一个新的角色的创造。这对我是有困难的。党为了让我学好这出戏，安排我到福建梨园戏学习，使我得到了梨园戏老师的帮助，完成了这个角色的创造。我在艺术上第三关是要我演现代戏《松柏长青》中的红军母亲李梨英，这个角色要我从一个封建时代的贤妻良母王金真跳跃到一个革命母亲——红军老战士，对我说来真是有很大困难的。第一次排演的时候，我只摹仿了一些戏曲老旦的动作，根本没有体会到李梨英的革命品质。所以排出来的人物，性格苍老而软弱。我怎样攻破这度关口呢？怎样能够使我这个没有革命经历的姑娘创造出伟大革命母亲的形象呢？这时候，是党帮助了我，又一次安排我到李梨英同志的家里，和她生活在一起，认真地学习她高贵的革命品质。在这一段生活中，她老人家常常用革命经历来教育和感染我，我才真正地学到了李梨英同志的一些品格、风貌，才能创造出带有几分“革命劲”的革命母亲的伟大形象来。我在艺术上的第四关是要我演《辞郎洲》里的陈璧娘。陈璧娘是个女诗人，又是个能带兵的民族英雄。我的历史常识很差，又不懂武功；党给我创造这个角色的任务时，我真不敢接受。因为我觉得这是个行当的问题，因为我学的是青衣，现在却要我演武旦，不晓得该怎么演。当党知道我有这种想法的时候，便鼓励我发挥敢想敢干的精神，要我勇敢地去打破行当的界线。替我请来京剧武打老师，又动员剧团中所有武打的同志成立一个组来帮助我。在党的鼓励下，我觉得不努力是不行的。一方面由于自己拚命学习，另一方面碰到困难有同志们帮助，胆子也就大了。比如我演至陈璧娘砍张宏范三刀时，老排不好，党便动员所有懂得武功的同志，分成几个小组，大家发挥所能，创造出各种不同的砍法，然后再合起来，选择其中好的揉合在一起，砍三刀的困难便解决了。在改编重排《辞郎洲》中，因为剧本改了十几次，每次都动了表演，因此进度慢，党便动员全体艺人用大字报的方法，集体想办法，有一次一个晚上贴了成千的大字报，贡献出两千多条修改重排的意见，结果把戏提高了。
    八年来，党安排了新文艺工作者到剧团工作，他们是我们潮剧革新的一股力量，从理论上、表演上都给我们很大的指导。我深深地感到，因为有党的领导，有共产主义风格的感召，专家们，群众，兄弟剧种的同志们对我才有这样无私的帮助。甚至医生、司机、商店的服务员都热情地支持我，使我有今天的进步。所以，人家说我是党培养出来的第一代演员是千真万确的。没有党，没有社会主义，我是不会成为一个能为工农兵服务的演员的。
