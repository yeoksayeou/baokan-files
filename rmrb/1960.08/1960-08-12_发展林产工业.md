Commentary: Develop the Forest Products Industry

Developing comprehensive utilization of timber and vigorously developing the forest products industry are important aspects of the technological revolution in the forestry industry sector, and also an important aspect of expanding sources of industrial raw materials. Transforming forest areas, which for many years have been solely producing timber, into diversified and comprehensive production bases is of great significance to the national economy.

Trees are treasures from head to toe. However, since ancient times, people have mostly used only the trunk of a tree. In this way, the utilization rate of a tree is only about 60%. The remaining branches, roots, bark, leaves, and processed slabs and sawdust are treated as waste. By establishing the artificial board industry and the forest chemical industry, it is possible to turn useless things into useful things, and to turn one use into multiple uses, turning these so-called waste materials into fiberboard, laminated timber, particleboard, tannin extract, rosin, alcohol, furfural, paper, and hundreds of products such as various feeds. This can not only better meet the needs of all parties for timber, but also promote the development of the chemical industry, light industry, and animal husbandry. Once comprehensively utilized, the value of timber is increased several times.

At present, thousands of forest product factories using both foreign and indigenous methods have been established across the country, and more will continue to be established in the future. Where is it better to establish such factories? It seems that establishing forest product factories in forest farms has the most advantages. First, branches, roots, bark, leaves, deadwood, etc., can be processed locally and fully utilized, which can save a lot of transportation capacity. Second, it can promote the development of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline businesses in forest areas, and prosper the forest area economy. Forest farms running factories can absorb a large number of employees' families to participate in production. The development of the forest products industry can also promote the improvement of the scientific and technological level of forest area employees. In this way, the appearance of the forest area can be fundamentally changed step by step. Forest farms running forest product industries should mainly use local logging residues and a large number of shrubs to produce fiberboard. Produce finished products if possible, and semi-finished products if not. If fiberboard cannot be produced, logging residues can also be processed into semi-fibers to supply fiberboard factories in towns to manufacture finished products. Forest farms with the right conditions should also use tree bark, roots, pine resin, pine cones, etc. to produce tannin extract, rosin, and turpentine oil and other products. At present, various departments have a very urgent need for artificial boards, tannin extract, and rosin. Three cubic meters of branches and waste can produce one cubic meter of fiberboard, and each cubic meter of fiberboard can replace more than five cubic meters of logs. This is a faster, better, and more economical way to increase timber production. Tannin extract and rosin are indispensable raw materials in the chemical and light industries, which cannot be replaced by other products and must be processed using forest resources. Therefore, forest farms with the right conditions must pay close attention to the production of these products. There are tens of thousands of forest farms in our country, and many valuable resources have not been utilized. It is hoped that forestry workers across the country will give full play to the spirit of self-reliance, and vigorously develop the forest products industry, mainly by adopting indigenous methods.

    发展林产工业
    发展木材综合利用，大办林产工业，是森林工业部门技术革命的一个重要方面，也是扩大工业原料来源的一个重要方面。使多少年来一直单纯生产木材的林区，变为多种经营的综合性的生产基地，是对国民经济有重要意义的一件事。
    树木全身是宝。可是自古以来，人们利用树木多半只用一根树干。这样，一棵树的利用率仅达60％左右。其余的枝丫、根、皮、叶和加工后的板皮、锯末等，都被当成废料处理了。兴办人造板工业和林产化学工业，就可以变无用为有用，变一用为多用，把这些所谓废料变成纤维板、胶合木、刨花板、栲胶、松香、酒精、糠醛、纸张以及各种饲料等上百种产品。这样，不仅可以更好地满足各方面对木材的需要，而且可以促进化学工业、轻工业、牧畜业的发展。一经综合利用，木材的身价就提高了几倍。
    现在全国各地已办起了成千上万的用洋法和土法生产的林产工厂，今后还要继续办。这种工厂在什么地方办更好呢？看来，就在林场办林产工厂，好处最多。第一，枝丫、根、皮、叶、枯倒木等，可以就地加工，充分利用，可以节约大量运力。第二，可以促进林区发展工业、农业、牧业、副业，繁荣林区经济。林场办工厂，可以吸收大批职工家属参加生产。林产工业发达了，还可以促进林区职工提高科学技术水平。这样，就可以逐步地从根本上改变林区的面貌。林场办林产工业，主要地应利用当地的采伐剩余物和大量的灌木生产纤维板。能生产成品的生产成品，不能生产成品的就生产半成品。如不能生产纤维板，也可以把采伐剩余物加工成半纤维，供给城镇的纤维板厂去制造成品。有条件的林场还应把树皮、根、松脂、松包等都利用起来生产栲胶、松香和松节油等产品。目前各个部门对人造板、栲胶、松香的需要很迫切。用三立方米枝丫、废材可以生产一立方米纤维板，每立方米纤维板可代替五立方米多原木使用。这是增产木材多快好省的办法。栲胶、松香是化学工业和轻工业中不可缺少的原料，既不能以别的产品代替，又必须利用森林资源加工。因此，有条件的林场必须十分重视这些产品的生产。我国现有数万个林场，还有很多宝贵的资源没有利用起来。希望全国的林业职工发挥自力更生的精神，以采用土法为主，大办林产工业。
