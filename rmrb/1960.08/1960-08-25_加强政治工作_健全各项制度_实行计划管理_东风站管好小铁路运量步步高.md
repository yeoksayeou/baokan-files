Strengthen Political Work, Improve Various Systems, and Implement Planned Management
Dongfeng Station Manages Small Railways Well, Achieving Steady Increases in Transportation Volume
(According to a report from *Dazhong Daily*) The Dongfeng Station of the Jinan Municipal Local Railway Company in Shandong Province has strengthened its operation and management of small railways, continuously improving transportation efficiency. The transportation volume in May increased by 74.01% compared to April, and the transportation volume in June increased by 13.3% compared to May. In July, it withstood the test of heavy rain and still managed to transport as much ore as was produced.

Dongfeng Station manages two light railways: one from the Dongfeng Iron Mine to the Jinan Iron and Steel Plant, and the other from the Panlongshan Iron Mine to the Jinan Iron and Steel Plant. The total length of the railway is 19.9 kilometers, equipped with five locomotives and 168 carriages. Since these two railways were completed and opened to traffic in December of last year and March of this year, respectively, the maximum daily transportation volume has reached 1,062 tons, replacing the previous eight trucks and forty hand-pulled carts. Transportation costs are 23.75% lower than by truck and 89.64% lower than by hand-pulled carts, playing an important role in ensuring the ore supply for the Jinan Iron and Steel Plant.

The reason why Dongfeng Station's small railway's transportation efficiency has been continuously improved is primarily due to the strengthening of political and ideological work among all employees. In the early stages of the railway's operation, employees from various backgrounds had inconsistent understandings of the local railway. Cadres and employees from the transportation sector were very happy to put down their "tow ropes" and participate in small railway transportation, but their understanding of the nature of local railways was insufficient. Managing the small railway with methods used for hand-pulled carts didn't work, leading to ideological distress. Some employees from the major railway systems looked down on the small railway, and some truck drivers were not accustomed to driving locomotives. In response to this situation, the station leadership launched a great airing of views among the employees, discussing both practical and theoretical issues, so that everyone could fully understand the great significance of building local railways and establish confidence in managing and utilizing the small railways effectively. Subsequently, Party branches, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations were established and improved, strengthening core leadership. At the same time, drawing on the experience of the major railways, station personnel were appropriately established, with clear divisions of labor. The station was divided into teams and work groups to carry out work such as train operation, loading and unloading, maintenance, and repairs.

They also focused on key and weak links in production, learning while doing, exploring while doing, and creating while doing, gradually establishing and improving various management systems. A full-line dispatcher was established to direct train operations according to the operating schedule. A track inspection system was established, with round-the-clock patrols to ensure continuous improvement in track quality. A locomotive and vehicle maintenance system was established, combining daily maintenance with regular overhauls. In addition, various production quota targets were formulated, such as the good vehicle rate, number of towed vehicles, load capacity, number of runs, and train speed, laying the foundation for implementing planned management and cost accounting.

In terms of implementing planned management, they absorbed the experience of major railways and, based on the characteristics of local railways having a certain degree of flexibility, combined the shift plan with the operating schedule, formulating an operating schedule station operation table every day based on the mine's production situation, implementing scheduled transportation. They also strengthened cooperation in all aspects throughout the station to ensure improved transportation efficiency.

Dongfeng Station also organized a "one-dragon" large-scale cooperation with mines and iron and steel plants to ensure that as much ore was produced as was transported, ensuring that blast furnaces did not lack "grain."

In the process of strengthening management work, this station, based on the characteristics of small railways going from nothing to something, from small to large, actively mobilized employees to adopt indigenous methods, vigorously carry out technical innovations, and self-made many indigenous equipment, creating favorable conditions for improving management and improving transportation efficiency.

    加强政治工作　健全各项制度　实行计划管理
    东风站管好小铁路运量步步高
    据大众日报消息　山东济南市地方铁路公司东风车站，加强对小铁路的经营管理，运输效率不断提高。5月份运量较4月份提高74.01％，6月份运量较5月份提高13.3％，7月份经受了大雨的考验，仍做到了矿石产多少运多少。
    东风车站管辖两条轻便铁路，一条是自东风铁矿到济南铁厂，一条是自盘龙山铁矿到济南铁厂。铁路全线共长十九点九公里，配备有机车五台、车厢一百六十八个。这两条铁路从去年12月和今年3月先后建成通车以来，每日最大运量可达一千零六十二吨，代替了过去的八部汽车和四十辆地排车、运费比汽车降低23.75％，比地排车降低89.64％，对保证济南铁厂矿石供应起了重要作用。
    东风车站小铁路的运输效率所以能够不断提高，首先是在全体职工中加强了政治思想工作。在铁路投入生产初期，全站来自各个方面的职工对地方铁路的认识不很一致。来自搬运方面的干部和职工，放下了“套子绳”，参加小铁路运输，非常高兴，但对地方铁路的性质认识不足，以管理地排车的方法管理小铁路，行不通则思想苦闷；来自大铁路方面的职工，有的还看不起小铁路；部分汽车司机不习惯开机车……。针对这种情况，站领导就发动职工大鸣大放，就实论虚，使大家充分认识修建地方铁路的重大意义，树立管好、用好小铁路的信心。接着又建立和健全了党支部及工会和共青团组织，加强了核心领导。同时，参照大铁路的经验，适当设立站务人员，明确分工；站下设队及班组，分别进行包乘、装卸、保养、维修等工作。
    他们还针对生产关键和薄弱环节，边干、边学、边摸索、边创造，逐步建立、健全了各种管理制度。设立了全线调度员，按运行图指挥行车；建立了巡道制度，昼夜巡查，保证了线路质量不断提高；建立了机车、车辆维护保养制度，作到日常维护与定期检修相结合。另外，制订了各种生产定额指标，如好车率、拖挂数、载重量、运行次数、列车时速等，为实行计划管理和成本核算打下了基础。
    在实行计划管理方面，他们吸取了大铁路的经验，又根据地方铁路具有一定灵活性的特点，把班计划与运行图合并，每天根据矿上生产情况，制定运行图车站作业表，实行定时运输。他们还在全站加强了各方面的协作，保证提高运输效率。
    东风车站还和矿山、铁厂组织了产运销一条龙大协作，保证矿石产多少运多少，保证高炉不缺“粮”。
    这个车站在加强管理工作的过程中，根据小铁路由无到有，由小到大的特点，积极发动职工采用土办法，大搞技术革新，自制了许多土设备，为搞好管理，提高运输效率创造了有利条件。
