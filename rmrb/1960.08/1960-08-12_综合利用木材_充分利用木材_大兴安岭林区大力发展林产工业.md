    Comprehensively Utilize Timber, Fully Utilize Timber
    The Greater Khingan Range Forest Area Vigorously Develops Forest Product Industries
    (Our dispatch) The Greater Khingan Range Forest Area in Inner Mongolia has launched a mass movement to vigorously develop forest product industries and comprehensively utilize timber. To date, over 900 "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" of forest product industrial factories have been built. In the past seven months, they have produced more than 30 products, including fiberboard, tannin extract, rosin, turpentine, birch bark oil, activated carbon, calcium acetate, wood flour, and acetone, weighing over 1,400 tons, with fiberboard and tannin extract accounting for more than half. This has transformed the Greater Khingan Range Forest Area from merely a timber production base to a production base for forest industrial products.
    Now, every forest farm and logging section has established forest product factories, changing the past situation of concentrating forest product industries in towns. The advantage of this is that logging residues can be processed locally and fully utilized, avoiding waste of resources and transportation capacity, and it can also change the appearance of the forest area and prosper the mountain economy.
    In the mass movement to vigorously develop forest product industries, this forest area implemented the policy of comprehensively developing forest product industries with a central focus. In terms of product production, it centered on utilizing logging residues—branches, tops, bark, pine resin pockets, slab wood, laths, sawdust, and other so-called "waste materials"—to produce fiberboard and tannin extract, which are most needed by the country at present, and comprehensively develop various forest product industries. Fiberboard, tannin extract, and rosin factories account for 53% of the factories now in production.
    In terms of factory construction, they adhered to the policy of self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods. Therefore, they maximized the enthusiasm of the broad masses and accelerated the progress of factory construction. Tens of thousands of workers, family members, and students from various forestry bureaus participated in this movement. When there were no bricks, they collected brick fragments to build factories. When there was a lack of equipment, everyone contributed their own large vats, copper basins, and other items as production tools. As a result, hundreds of factories were established in a very short period.
    While forest farms were vigorously developing "small indigenous groups," the Forest Management Bureau and many forestry bureaus also built more than ten large, medium, and small-sized backbone factories producing forest products using foreign methods. Among them, six foreign fiberboard factories with an annual output of 600 tons have been put into production. With the impetus and help of these backbone factories, the technical level of forest product industrial production throughout the forest area can be rapidly improved. (Attached picture)

    综合利用木材　充分利用木材
    大兴安岭林区大力发展林产工业
    本报讯　内蒙古大兴安岭林区掀起了大办林产工业、综合利用木材的群众运动。到目前为止，已建成“小土群”和“小洋群”林产工业工厂九百多座，七个月来已生产出纤维板、栲胶、松香、松节油、桦树皮油、活性炭、醋石、木粉、丙酮等三十多种产品，重达一千四百多吨，其中纤维板和栲胶就占一半多。使大兴安岭林区不仅是木材生产基地，而且开始成为林产工业品的生产基地。
    现在，每个林场和采伐工段，都办起了林产品工厂，改变了过去集中在城镇上办林产工业的局面。它的好处是可以将采伐剩余物就地加工，充分利用，避免浪费资源和运输力，又可以改变林区面貌，繁荣山区经济。
    在大办林产工业运动中，这个林区贯彻执行了有中心地全面发展林产工业的方针。在产品生产方面以利用采伐剩余物：枝丫、梢头、树皮、松油包、板皮、板条、锯末子等所谓“废料”，生产国家当前最需要的纤维板、栲胶为中心，全面发展各种林产工业。现在投入生产的工厂中，纤维板、栲胶和松香厂占53％。
    在建厂方面，他们坚持了自力更生，土洋并举的方针，因此，最大限度地调动了广大群众的积极性，加快了建厂进度。各林业局的职工、家属和学生等数万人参加了这一运动。没有砖，他们就拣砖头建厂，缺设备，大家就拿出自己的大缸、铜盆等来作生产工具，因此在很短的期间内，就办起了几百个工厂。
    在林场大办“小土群”的同时，林管局和许多林业局还建设了十多个大、中、小型洋法生产的林产骨干工厂，其中六个年产六百吨的洋纤维板厂已投入生产。有了这些骨干厂的带动和帮助，全林区的林产工业生产技术水平就可以得到迅速提高。（附图片）
