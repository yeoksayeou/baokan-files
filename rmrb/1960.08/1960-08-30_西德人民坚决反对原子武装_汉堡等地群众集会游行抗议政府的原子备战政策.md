　　Comprehensive report from this newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency, the mass movement of the West German people against nuclear armament is vigorously unfolding. Since the publication of the memorandum of the West German "Bundeswehr" (Federal Defence Force) General Staff, the call to stop West German nuclear armament has become even louder.
　　Around August 6th, the 15th anniversary of the United States dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, people in various parts of West Germany held demonstrations against nuclear armament. On the 7th, the "Joint Action Committee Against Nuclear Armament" in Hamburg organized a mass meeting and parade attended by more than 1,000 people in Hamburg. Peace activist Klaus Zuker spoke at the meeting, calling on the West German people to wage a more resolute struggle than in the past against the West German government's equipping the West German army with nuclear weapons. A motorcade through the city of Hamburg was held before the meeting. Protesters held aloft signs reading "Strive for peace through struggle!" and "Join us in opposing the Federal Defence Force possessing nuclear weapons." On the 8th, more than 1,000 people in Hamburg participated in a rally protesting the Bonn government's nuclear arms race. They demanded a permanent halt to nuclear weapons testing. In addition, people held rallies at the graves of Hamburg citizens who died in air raids during World War II.
　　In Wedel, Schleswig-Holstein, the local anti-nuclear armament organization distributed leaflets demanding that the West German government immediately abandon equipping the West German army with nuclear weapons and not allow nuclear weapons to be stored on West German territory. The organization also advocated that the two Germanys negotiate with representatives of the German Democratic Republic on arms limitation and other issues related to maintaining peace. Demonstrations against the nuclear arms race were also held in Ahrensburg and Duisburg in the Ruhr. Demonstrators raised the slogans "Oppose nuclear weapons! Fight for a Germany without atomic bombs" and demanded immediate action to stop the West German "Bundeswehr" from being armed with nuclear weapons.
　　The Fifth Congress of the West German Construction Workers' Union, which closed in Hanover on August 19, representing 430,000 West German construction workers, unanimously opposed equipping the West German "Bundeswehr" with nuclear weapons.
　　The publication of the West German "Bundeswehr" General Staff memorandum has "shocked public opinion at home and abroad."
　　The West German "Association of Victims of Nazism" recently issued a statement firmly protesting the arrogant demands of the West German "Bundeswehr" General Staff generals.
　　The statement pointed out that the only way to respond to this memorandum of the West German generals is to unite all democratic forces to defend peace and democracy and to ensure a bright future for the West German people.

    西德人民坚决反对原子武装
    汉堡等地群众集会游行抗议政府的原子备战政策
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：最近以来，西德人民反对原子武装的群众运动正在蓬勃地展开着。而在西德“国防军”参谋部的备忘录发表以后，要求制止西德原子武装的呼声就更加响亮了。
    早在美国向日本广岛投掷原子弹的十五周年——8月6日前后，西德各地人民就纷纷举行反对原子武装的示威游行。汉堡“反对原子武装行动联合会”7日在汉堡组织了有一千多人参加的群众大会和游行。和平人士克拉舒茨克耳在大会上讲话，号召西德人民要比过去更坚决地展开反对西德政府用原子武器装备西德军队的斗争。在大会前举行了穿过汉堡市的汽车游行。游行者高举着“用斗争争取和平！”和“和我们一道反对联邦国防军拥有原子武装”的标语牌。8日，汉堡又有一千多人参加了抗议波恩政府进行核军备竞赛的集会。他们要求永久停止试验核武器。此外，人们还到在第二次世界大战中因空袭而死的汉堡公民墓前举行了集会。
    在石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因州的威德尔，当地的反对原子武装的组织散发传单，要求西德政府立即放弃以原子武器装备西德军队，并且不让原子武器存放在西德领土上。这个组织还主张要就两个德国在军备限制及有关维护和平的其他问题上同德意志民主共和国的代表谈判。在阿伦斯堡和鲁尔的杜伊斯堡，也举行了反对核军备竞赛的示威。示威者提出“反对核武器！为争取一个没有原子弹的德国而斗争”的口号，并且要求立即采取行动来制止用核武器武装西德“国防军”。
    8月19日在汉诺威闭幕的西德建筑工人工会第五次大会代表西德四十三万建筑工人，一致反对以原子武器装备西德“国防军”。
    西德“国防军”参谋部的备忘录发表后，更是引起了西德“国内外公众的震动”。
    西德“受纳粹之害者协会”最近发表声明，坚决抗议西德“国防军”参谋部将军们的狂妄要求。
    声明指出，回答西德将军们的这个备忘录的唯一方法是：团结一切民主力量来保卫和平、民主，来保证西德人民的光明未来。
