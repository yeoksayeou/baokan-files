Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, August 21st: According to a broadcast by Guinean radio last night, the President of the Republic of Guinea, Sékou Touré, sent a telegram to the United Nations Security Council on August 20th regarding the situation in the Republic of Congo, condemning the UN officials' collusive attitude towards the enemies of Congolese independence and unity.

In the telegram, Touré pointed out that the UN representatives responsible for implementing the Security Council resolution in the Congo are everywhere replacing the powers of the Congolese central government and refusing to use UN forces within the scope of the Congolese government's concerns to promote the withdrawal of Belgian aggressor troops and restore domestic peace in the Republic of Congo, safeguarding its territorial integrity. Touré pointed out that the United Nations, which came to aid the Congolese people at the request of the sole central government of the Republic of Congo, cannot ignore the existence of this central government and its sovereignty over the entire national territory of the Congo.

Touré pointed out: The UN representatives not only failed to completely withdraw the Belgian troops as requested by the Congolese people and the Security Council resolution, but they also continued to disregard the authority of the Congolese central government, and the UN Secretary-General even directly negotiated with Tshombe, thereby encouraging separatist activities in Katanga Province.

Touré emphasized: We should clearly point out that the entire African public opinion severely condemns the ambiguous attitude of the UN representatives in the Congo, who are illegally trying to convince world opinion that there are two legitimate authorities in the Congo: the Congolese central government and the Katanga provincial government.

Sékou Touré said that we solemnly reiterate that there can be no compromise between truth and lies, between the legitimate rights of the people and imperialist aggression.

Touré said in the telegram: The situation in the Republic of Congo not only dangerously threatens the tranquility, independence, and territorial integrity of this young republic, but also threatens peace in Africa and the world. He called on people to promote the respect of the interests of the Congolese people who are suffering from blatant injustice.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad: The Iraqi "Independent" newspaper published an editorial on August 18th condemning the United Nations' attitude towards the situation in the Congo. The editorial said that the United Nations will fail in this test as it has failed in other tests. The newspaper pointed out that as long as the United Nations is under the control of the United States, it is natural that people cannot expect the United Nations to do anything good.

The newspaper condemned the UN Secretary-General for negotiating with the puppet Tshombe in the same way as he would negotiate with the legitimate government of the Congo, thereby indicating the UN's recognition of him.

The newspaper also said that the Belgian imperialist army is still rampaging in many parts of the Congo, and Tshombe is still creating divisions in Katanga province, and is protected by the Belgian army and the "UN forces." The "UN forces" not only did not control the imperialists and their agents, but instead controlled the Congolese people and their army. The newspaper emphasized that all this will inevitably arouse the indignation of the Congolese people and government.

    几内亚总统杜尔致电联合国安理会
    谴责联合国代表漠视刚果主权
    伊拉克“独立报”指出联合国在美国控制下就不会做出好事
    新华社科纳克里21日电　据几内亚电台昨晚广播，几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔20日就刚果共和国的局势打电报给联合国安全理事会，谴责联合国负责人对刚果独立和统一的敌人采取共谋的态度。
    杜尔在电报中指出，负责在刚果执行安理会决议的联合国代表到处在取代刚果中央政府的权力，并且拒绝在刚果政府关心的范围内利用联合国部队来促使比利时侵略军撤退和恢复刚果共和国国内和平，保障其领土完整。杜尔指出，应刚果共和国唯一的中央政府的要求来援助刚果人民的联合国，不能无视这个中央政府的存在和这个政府对整个刚果的国家领土拥有主权。
    杜尔指出：联合国的代表们不仅没有像刚果人民和安理会决议所要求的那样来使比利时军队完全撤走，他们反而继续漠视刚果中央政府的权力，而联合国秘书长还同冲伯直接谈判，从而鼓励加丹加省的分裂活动。
    杜尔强调说：我们应该明确地指出，整个非洲舆论严厉谴责联合国在刚果的代表们的含糊态度，他们非法地试图使世界舆论相信，刚果存在着两个合法当局：刚果中央政府和加丹加省政府。
    塞古·杜尔说，我们庄严地重申，真理和谎言之间、人民的正当权利和帝国主义的侵略之间，是不可能有什么妥协的。
    杜尔在电报中说：刚果共和国的局势不仅危险地威胁着这个年青共和国的安宁、独立和领土完整，而且威胁着非洲和世界和平。他呼吁人们促使遭到明目张胆的不正义之害的刚果人民的利益得到尊重。
    据新华社巴格达电　伊拉克“独立报”18日发表社论，谴责联合国对刚果局势的态度。社论说，联合国在这场考验中将和在其它考验中一样遭到失败。这家报纸指出，只要联合国在美国控制之下，人们就不能指望联合国作出什么好事情来，这是很自然的。
    这家报纸谴责联合国秘书长像同刚果的合法政府进行谈判那样去同傀儡冲伯进行谈判，这样来表示联合国承认它。
    这家报纸又说，比利时帝国主义军队仍然在刚果的许多地方放肆横行，冲伯在加丹加省还在制造分裂，并受到比利时军队和“联合国军”的保护。“联合国军”不但没有控制帝国主义者及其代理人，反而控制刚果人民及其军队。这家报纸强调说，这一切必将激起刚果人民和政府的愤慨。
