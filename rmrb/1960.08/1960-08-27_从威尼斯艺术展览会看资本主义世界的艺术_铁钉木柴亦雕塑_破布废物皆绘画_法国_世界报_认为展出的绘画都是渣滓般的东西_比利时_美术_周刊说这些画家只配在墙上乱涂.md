Title: Art in the Capitalist World as Seen from the Venice Art Exhibition: Iron Nails and Firewood Also Sculpture, Rags and Waste All Painting. France's "Le Monde" Thinks the Exhibited Paintings are Dregs. Belgium's "Beaux Arts" Weekly Says These Painters Only Deserve to Scribble on Walls

From the Venice Art Exhibition:

    At the Thirtieth Venice Art Exhibition held recently, the art works of capitalist countries, from content to form, are all kinds of formalist schools, filled with screws, tacks, rags, and scrap iron. Even the French bourgeois newspaper "Le Monde" said that this "absurd, stimulating exhibition" can be said to be a heterodox approach, and the exhibited works may be easier to create than to look at once. "This raises concerning questions about the future of art."

    The American pavilion is filled with the recently popular "Abstract Expressionism" and other strange and incomprehensible works. "Le Monde" special correspondent Gonier-Lacoste commented: In the American pavilion, one can only see Hoffman's canvases painted with large blocks of red, and Klein's increasingly simple works with black squares on a white background. The French journalist believes that this kind of dross can easily lead painting to the point of simply disappearing. The Belgian "Beaux Arts" weekly commented: Painters like Klein and Hoffman are probably more suitable for scribbling on walls than painting on canvas.

    The American "painter" Klein, who participated in the exhibition, wrote in the instructions: "It seems that the works initially composed of black and white still have some relationship with the image. Later, I felt that some parts of my works seemed to mean something, but it was extremely difficult for me to label it or point out its plot. To tell the truth, I can't say anything about black and white paintings."

    All the works of capitalist countries won prizes at this exhibition, and the two grand prizes were won by Jean Fautrier of France and Hans Hartung, a French painter of German origin. Fautrier's work is called "Wada Dada", the bottom of the painting is a dark and blurred color, with a fruit-like section in the middle, mottled traces, like a piece of mud. Hartung's main award-winning work this time is "T 1936—2", the picture looks like a piece of white paper with some shadows, with a few irregular black and white lines drawn on it.

    Nails have become the favorite objects of "sculptors" and "painters". In the Yugoslav pavilion, there is a "sculpture" made entirely of nails, which is considered to be the "masterpiece" of the young Dusan Dzamonja. It seems that he took a piece of firewood, patiently hammered tens of thousands of nails on it, then welded the nail heads together, and finally burned the firewood, leaving a "masterpiece" composed purely of nails.

    Painting is not far behind in this regard. In the Spanish pavilion, paintings made of tacks and screws can be said to be "dazzling". Alberto Burri's painting entitled "Great Iron" also won an award. This painting is actually formed by nailing one hundred and seven nails. Someone discovered that there were one hundred and eight nail holes on the painting, and the critics came out to defend, saying: "Doesn't the painter have the right to leave a hole without a nail?"

    In addition to nails, the "art masters" of capitalist countries have also favored other strange objects to form their own paintings and sculptures. Wire mesh, cigarette paper, napkins used in bars, and even bicycle chains, funnels, and frying pans have been used! The Spaniard Miel painted a door, and in the position of the door lock, he hung a real iron latch and a lead door handle. This painting was entitled "Painting with Real Objects". The "individualistic" work of the Japanese "sculptor" Ohno is a variety of balls: whole, broken, hollow, solid, dirty, clean, rubber, glass, called "Ingenious".

    The Italian "painter" Burri can be regarded as a master of waste utilization. One of his "paintings" entitled "Red" is pasted with torn pieces of shirts, cigarette paper, rags, and shreds of cloth on a red canvas. His other "Greasy Tuesday" has shredded pajamas, pillowcase edges with buttonholes, sleeves made of black wool, and a scorched vest. (Xinhua News Agency)

    从威尼斯艺术展览会看资本主义世界的艺术
    铁钉木柴亦雕塑　破布废物皆绘画
    法国“世界报”认为展出的绘画都是渣滓般的东西
    比利时“美术”周刊说这些画家只配在墙上乱涂
    不久前在威尼斯举行的第三十届威尼斯艺术展览会上，资本主义国家的艺术作品从内容到形式都是各种形式主义流派的，充斥着螺丝钉、洋钉、破布、烂铁。连法国资产阶级报纸“世界报”也说，这次“荒谬、刺激的展览”可以说是旁门邪道的，展出的作品可能创作出来比看它一次还容易。“这对艺术的发展前途，集中提出了可虑的问题。”
    美国馆里充斥着近来风糜一时的“抽象表现派”和其它形形色色令人莫名其妙的作品。“世界报”特派记者戈尼尔—拉科斯特评论说：在美国馆里，人只能看到霍夫曼的涂着大块红色的画布和克莱因越来越简单的、在白底上画黑方块的作品。这位法国记者认为这种渣滓般的东西很易把绘画导向干脆消灭的境地。比利时“美术”周刊评论说：像克莱因和霍夫曼这样的画家，恐怕在墙上乱涂比在画布上作画要合适得多。
    参加展览会的美国“画家”克莱因在说明书上写道：“看来，最初用黑和白构成的作品中还与形象有着某一些关系。稍后，我就觉得，我的作品的某些地方仿佛意味着什么，可是我极难为它标上名称或是指出它的情节。说真话，关于白和黑的绘画我是什么话也讲不出来的。”
    在这届展览会上获奖的全部是资本主义国家的作品，获得了两个大奖的是法国的让·傅特里埃和原籍德国的法国画家汉斯·哈尔登。傅特里埃的作品叫做“哇哒哒”，画底是一片阴暗模糊的颜色，中间有块状似水果剖面的东西，痕迹斑斑，像一片泥浆。哈尔登这次获奖的主要作品是“T 1936—2”，画面好像一块有些暗影的白纸，上面画上了几根不规则的黑、白线等。
    钉子成了“雕塑家”和“画家”的心爱之物。在南斯拉夫馆内，陈列着一座完全用钉子组成的“雕塑”，它被认为是年青的杜尚·德扎蒙的“杰作”。看来，他是取了一块木柴，耐心地将数以万计的钉子敲到上面，然后将钉头焊接在一起，最后用火烧掉木柴，这就留下了纯粹由钉子组成的“杰作”了。
    绘画在这方面丝毫也不落后。在西班牙馆内，用洋钉、螺丝钉制作的画真可以说是“琳琅满目”。阿尔拜耳托·布利的一幅题为“巨大的铁”的画也得了奖。这幅画实际上是钉上了一百零七枚钉形成的。有人发现画上有着一百零八个钉孔，批评家就出来辩护说：“难道画家就没有权利留下一个没有钉子的窟窿吗？”
    除了钉子以外，资本主义国家的“艺术大师们”还垂青上了其它无奇不有的实物，用来组成自己的画幅和雕塑。铁丝网、香烟纸、酒吧间内使用的餐巾，甚至自行车链、漏斗、平底锅等都被使用上了！西班牙的米耶尔画了一个门，在门锁的地位他挂上了一个真正的铁闩和一个铅制的门把手，这幅画被题名为“带实物的绘画”。日本“雕塑家”大野的“富有个性”的作品是各种各样的球：整的、破的、空心的、实心的、脏的、干净的、橡皮的、玻璃的，叫作“独出心裁”。
    意大利的“画家”布利真可算是一位废物利用的能手了。他的一幅题为“红色的”“画”是在红色的画幅上粘贴上了衬衫的破布片、香烟纸、抹布和破布条。他的另一幅“油腻的星期二”上有着剪碎的睡衣、带着扣眼的枕套边、黑毛料制的袖子以及烧焦了的背心。　（新华社）
