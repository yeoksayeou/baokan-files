    Water-Watching Sister-in-Law  Li Xiaobai
    The switch is flipped,
    The waterwheel shouts;
    The well platform is a desk,
    Fingers are the writing brush.
    Yesterday she pushed the waterwheel,
    Today she manages the electricity;
    Without water, it's hard to have a good harvest,
    Without culture, how can we be commune members!
    One new character written five times,
    To be crushed, to be chewed thoroughly;
    A gentle breeze blows,
    But can't sweep away the sweat on her brow.
    Water splashes like sweet dew,
    The crops show smiling faces;
    New characters blossom in her heart,
    Which can be seen on her face.
    Who cares if the quitting-time bell rings urgently,
    She pretends not to hear it;
    The pages rustle,
    The wheels whir.
      Book Distributor
    Carrying a load of culture,
    He strides into the deep mountains;
    A handkerchief of sweat,
    A mind full of routes:
    Wangjia Ridge,
    There's a meeting today;
    Lijia Gully,
    The night school opens tomorrow;
    Right, and he must go to Liu Village,
    To deliver a book on "Chicken Raising" to Third Sister,
    And a copy of "China Youth" to Second Brother.
    Carefully calculated,
    The road is a hundred *li* long;
    Shaking his shoulders,
    It's truly a load of a thousand catties!
    His footsteps sweep through wind and clouds,
    His heart is a riding whip;
    Pointing towards the peak of science,
    Stepping onto the mountain of culture;
    The load shines higher and higher,
    Truly like a
    Rocket carrying a satellite!

    看水大嫂（外一首）	李晓白
    电门一扳，
    水车叫唤；
    井台是课桌，
    指头笔一杆。
    昨日推水车，
    今天要管电；
    没水难丰收，
    没文化怎当社员！
    一个生字写五遍，
    要咬碎，要嚼烂；
    清风徐徐吹，
    扫不落她头上汗。
    水花似甘露，
    田禾露出笑颜；
    生字开花在心里，
    从她脸上能看见。
    哪管下工铃急，
    假装没有听见；
    书页嗦嗦响，
    轮子哗哗转。
      图书发行员
    挑一担文化，
    迈步儿来到深山；
    一手帕汗珠，
    一脑子路线：
    王家岭，
    今天有会；
    李家沟，
    夜校明天开班；
    对，还得去刘庄，
    给三娘送一本《养鸡》，
    给二弟送一份《中国青年》。
    仔细一算，
    路儿百里远；
    抖抖肩膀，
    真是一副千斤担！
    脚步扫风云，
    心是策马鞭；
    指向科学岭，
    踏上文化山；
    担子越闪越高，
    真像一支
    载运卫星的火箭！
