    Grasp the Key
    Dai Guoqiang
    In the technical revolution movement, the Nanjing Woodworking Factory mobilized the masses to adopt the method of examining each item in order, conducting in-depth and meticulous inspections of all innovation projects. Through inspection, they concentrated their efforts on projects that could be promoted but were not yet fully promoted, studying and improving them one by one, making them evolve from imperfect to relatively perfect, and then applying them universally to production, thereby rapidly increasing production. This matter gives us a great insight: when promoting the achievements of technical innovation, we cannot be satisfied with the projects that have already been promoted and neglect those that have not yet been promoted.
    Why? This is because the impact of technical reforms and inventions on production cannot be entirely determined by quantity, but rather by whether such innovations can solve key problems in production. In some cases, among a large number of projects, there are those that can solve key production issues. Promoting the majority of these is not the same as grasping the crux of the problem. The remaining few projects are considered less important. However, there are also cases where the majority of projects that have already been promoted and used have few or none that can solve key production issues, while the innovation projects that can truly solve key production issues are among the few that have not been promoted or are not yet perfect. The portion that the Nanjing Woodworking Factory identified through the examination process plays a crucial role in the entire technical revolution movement, determining the overall situation. This is because the promotion and use of this portion of projects can not only increase production but also relate to the consolidation of past achievements and the prospects for future development. If the leadership is satisfied with what has already been promoted and ignores this crucial part, production will not only fail to improve further, but even the achievements already made cannot be consolidated.
    Generally speaking, the innovation projects that are successfully tested only at the very end, the innovation projects that are more difficult to promote, are more likely to be key. This is because key projects, since they address the main contradictions in production, often involve a wider range of aspects and are more complex. It often takes a relatively long time and repeated experiments for people to fully understand and master their internal connections. Therefore, when carrying out the increased production and conservation movement centered on grain and steel, every enterprise must, under the leadership of the Party committee, adopt a method that combines leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel to further concentrate, sort out, review, and appraise the achievements of the technical revolution movement, summarize, improve, and systematize those that have a direct impact on solving the current key production issues, have the greatest effect, and have universal significance, and quickly promote their use. For those innovation projects that have not been fully successful in testing but are indeed key, we must make persistent efforts, persevere in experimentation, and not give up until success is achieved.

    抓关键
    戴国强
    南京木器厂在技术革命运动中，发动群众采取条条排队、项项过堂的办法，对所有的革新项目进行深入细致的检查；通过检查，对于某些能够推广还没有完全推广的项目，集中力量，一个一个地加以研究和改进，使之从不完善到比较完善，然后普遍用于生产，使生产迅速提高，这件事给我们一个很大的启示，就是在推广技术革新成果的时候，不能满足于已经推广的项目，忽视那些尚未推广的项目。
    为什么？这是因为技术上的改革和发明，对于生产作用的大小，不能完全由数量来决定，而要看这种革新能不能解决生产上的关键问题。在有些情况下，在为数较多的项目中，包含有能解决生产关键的项目在内，推广了大多数，就算抓住了问题的症结所在。而剩下的少数项目，就比较不重要了。但是，也有这样的情况，就是在已经推广使用的大多数项目中，没有或者很少能解决生产关键的，而真正能解决生产关键的革新项目，却在那些未推广使用、或者还不很完善的少数项目里面。南京木器厂通过排队排出来的部分，就是对整个技术革命运动具有关键作用的决定大局的。因为这部分项目的推广使用，不仅可以提高生产，而且关系到过去成绩的巩固和今后发展的前途。如果领导上满足于已经推广了的，而对这关键部分不理不睬，那么生产不但不能进一步提高，而且连已经取得的成果也不能巩固下来。
    一般说来，越是留到最后才能试验成功的革新项目，越是不易推广的革新项目，越有可能是关键性的。这是因为关键性的项目，既然是解决生产中的主要矛盾的，就往往涉及的面比较广，也比较错综复杂，人们要全面认识和掌握它们的内在连系，往往需要比较长的时间，需要反反复复的试验。因此，在开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的时候，每一个企业，都要在党委的领导下，采取领导干部、工人、技术人员三结合的办法，对技术革命运动的成果，进一步集中整理、审查和鉴定，把那些对于解决当前生产关键有直接作用的收效最大的和有普遍意义的，加以总结、提高，使之系统化，迅速推广使用。对于那些试验没有完全成功，但确实是关键性的革新项目，必须再接再厉，坚持试验，不成功不罢休。
