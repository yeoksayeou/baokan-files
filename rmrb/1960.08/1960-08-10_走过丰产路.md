    Walking on Abundance Road,
    Who wouldn't stop:
    Looking to the left,
    "Party Committee Command Field,"
    Dozens of acres in a single glance,
    Water is plentiful and fertilizer abundant;
    Leaves broad,
    Stems thick,
    Seedlings green to the point of black.
    Looking to the right,
    "March 8th High-Yield Slope,"
    Corn is like a forest, already ripe,
    Each stalk carrying three or four ears.
    Corn is being harvested,
    Sweet potato vines cover the slope.
    A team of women comes down the slope,
    Laughter and voices,
    Baskets filled with the joy of harvest.
    On both sides of the road,
    Not an inch of wasteland is seen,
    Melon vines trip your feet,
    Cowpeas climb the roadside trees;
    Where the wind blows,
    Each pumpkin reveals a big belly,
    Hanging cowpeas like tassels,
    Sesame, mung beans, sunflowers,
    Yellow and green,
    Tall and short,
    Like an open department store.
    Just as we marvel,
    A string of ox carts creaks by,
    Each cart loaded with pearl kernels.
    The whip cracks,
    A mountain song rises:
    "A road of abundance,
    A treasure trove,
    The people's commune is infinitely good,
    Pearl treasures are hauled by carts."

### 走过丰产路

    走过丰产路	张继楼
    走过丰产路，
    哪个不停步：
    向左看，
    “党委指挥田”，
    一眼望去数十亩，
    水满肥又足；
    叶儿宽，
    秆儿粗，
    秧苗绿得发了乌。
    向右看，
    “三八高产坡”，
    包谷如林已成熟，
    株株背包三、四个。
    包谷正收割，
    苕藤封了坡。
    一队妇女下坡来，
    笑语声声，
    罗筐装满丰收乐。
    道两旁，
    不见一寸荒废土，
    瓜藤绊住脚，
    豇豆爬上行道树；
    风吹处，
    个个南瓜露大肚，
    吊吊豇豆像流苏，
    芝麻、绿豆、向日葵，
    黄黄绿绿，
    高高矮矮，
    好像开的百货铺。
    正惊叹，
    一溜牛车伊呀过，
    车车满载珍珠颗。
    鞭梢响，
    起山歌：
    “一条丰产路，
    一个百宝窝，
    人民公社无限好，
    珍珠宝贝用车拖。”
