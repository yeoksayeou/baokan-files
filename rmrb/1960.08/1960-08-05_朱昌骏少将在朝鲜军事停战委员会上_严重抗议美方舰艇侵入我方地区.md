Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong: The Korean Military Armistice Commission held its 124th meeting on the 3rd, as suggested by the Korean and Chinese sides.

　　Chief Commissioner Zhu Changjun of the Korean and Chinese side lodged a strong protest at the meeting to the U.S. side regarding the hostile act of the U.S. Navy warships intruding into the coastal area of the Korean and Chinese side on July 30. He pointed out that this incident was a blatant violation of the Armistice Agreement by the U.S. side and a serious act of perfidy that endangered the Korean armistice.

　　Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that among the hostile acts carried out by the U.S. side from the ground, sea, and air, there have been as many as 40 incidents in which armed ships and armed personnel invaded the coastal and shoreline areas of the Korean and Chinese side, attacked ships of the Korean and Chinese side, and killed and abducted peaceful residents, and the Korean and Chinese side has protested to the U.S. side. Among them, there were three provocative activities carried out by the U.S. side invading the Korean and Chinese coast in the twelve days from July 19 to July 30. He said that now all the Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world are condemning the U.S. side's continued piracy.

　　Next, Major General Zhu Changjun strongly demanded that the U.S. side severely punish all U.S. personnel who intruded into the coastal areas of the Korean and Chinese side on July 30 and engaged in hostile activities, in accordance with Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement, and immediately take responsible measures to prevent similar provocative acts from happening again.

　　Faced with irrefutable facts, the U.S. side could not conceal its criminal acts and shamelessly fabricated its usual lies to evade responsibility.

　　Major General Zhu Changjun sternly condemned the U.S. side for this, saying that the U.S. side's provocative action was a planned and prepared action. Without stopping this hostile behavior by the U.S. side, the Korean armistice cannot be maintained, nor can the tension in Korea be eliminated. Major General Zhu Changjun demanded that the U.S. side severely punish those involved in this provocative action and report the results to the Military Armistice Commission.

　　Finally, Major General Zhu Changjun emphasized to the U.S. side that the Korean and Chinese side will continue to strictly hold the U.S. side accountable for this incident until the U.S. side guarantees to the Korean and Chinese side that it will fulfill the legitimate demands of the Korean and Chinese side and will no longer engage in similar hostile acts.

    朱昌骏少将在朝鲜军事停战委员会上
    严重抗议美方舰艇侵入我方地区
    新华社平壤4日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：朝鲜军事停战委员会根据朝中方面的建议3日举行第一百二十四次会议。
    朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将在会上就美方海军舰艇7月30日侵入朝中方面地区沿海进行敌对行为的事件，向美方提出了严重抗议。他指出，这次事件是美方对停战协定的粗暴违反，是危及朝鲜停战的严重的背信弃义行为。
    朱昌骏少将指出，美方从地上、海上和空中进行的敌对行为中，仅派遣武装船只和武装人员侵入朝中方面沿海和海岸地区，攻击朝中方面船只、杀害和劫持和平居民的事件，经朝中方面向美方提出抗议的就达四十起之多。其中从7月19日到7月30日的十二天期间，美方侵入朝中方面沿海进行的挑衅活动就有三次。他说，现在全体朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都在谴责美方继续不断进行的海盗行为。
    接着，朱昌骏少将强硬要求美方根据停战协定第十三款辰项严惩7月30日侵入朝中方面地区沿海进行敌对行为的美方的一切人员，并立即采取负责措施使不再发生类似的挑衅行为。
    美方在无可辩驳的事实面前，无法掩盖自己的犯罪行为，又无耻地捏造了惯用的谎言来逃避责任。
    朱昌骏少将就此严厉谴责美方说，美方这次进行的挑衅行动，是事先有计划、有准备的行动。不制止美方的这种敌对行为，就不能维护朝鲜停战，也不能消除朝鲜的紧张局势。朱昌骏少将要求美方严惩这次挑衅行动有关人员，并将其结果报告给军事停战委员会。
    最后，朱昌骏少将向美方强调指出，朝中方面今后要继续严格追究美方对这次事件的责任，直到美方向朝中方面保证履行朝中方面的正当要求，不再进行类似敌对行为为止。
