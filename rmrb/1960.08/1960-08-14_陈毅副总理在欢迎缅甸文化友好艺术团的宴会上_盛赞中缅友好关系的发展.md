Xinhua News Agency, August 13th—Vice Premier Chen Yi, at a banquet tonight welcoming the Burmese Cultural Friendship Art Troupe, said: "The fact that China and Burma live in amity eloquently demonstrates that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully as long as both sides have a sincere desire for friendship." He said that the development of Sino-Burmese friendly relations proves that the recent slanders by some Western countries, who are making ulterior motives, that China has abandoned its policy of peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems are not worth refuting.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: We are pleased to see that Premier Zhou Enlai recently once again proposed the initiative of signing a treaty of non-aggression and peace among Asian and Pacific coastal countries, including the United States, to make this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone, which has been welcomed and praised by the Burmese people and peace-loving people around the world. He said that the US government has rejected China's peace proposal. This vividly proves who in the world does not want peaceful coexistence, who wants to maintain tension, and who wants to adhere to a policy of war and aggression. Vice Premier Chen Yi said: However, the will of the people of the world to strive for peace is irresistible, and those who deliberately undermine world peace will surely reap the consequences of their actions.

Vice Premier Chen Yi held a banquet at the Great Hall of the People tonight to welcome all distinguished guests of the Burmese Cultural Friendship Art Troupe, headed by U Ba Swe as the leader. Vice Premier of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, attended the banquet.

Burmese Ambassador to China Kyaw Winn and his wife, as well as diplomatic officials from the embassy, were invited to attend the banquet.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended a warm welcome to all the artists from the friendly neighboring country of Burma. When he talked about the long-standing friendly relations between the Chinese and Burmese peoples, he said that in the past six years, our two governments have adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Nu, creating a brilliant example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

Vice Premier Chen Yi happily talked about the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the Sino-Burmese Boundary Issue Agreement, and the success of the Sino-Burmese Joint Boundary Committee talks. He said that these have laid a solid foundation for the final resolution of the border issues left over from history between China and Burma. The negotiations on the Sino-Burmese boundary issue have set a good example for international negotiations.

Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke highly of Burmese art, saying that Burmese art has strong national characteristics, and the performing skills of Burmese artists have reached a high level. This is the result of the Burmese government and people attaching importance to, inheriting, and carrying forward the excellent national cultural traditions. He said that the Burmese Cultural Friendship Art Troupe is not only an envoy of culture and art, but also an envoy of peace and friendship.

Leader U Ba Swe then spoke. He said that the purpose of our visit to China at the invitation is to bring the friendly wishes of the Burmese people to China. We are envoys bringing the friendship of the Burmese people to China.

U Ba Swe said that since the first day we arrived in China, we have been warmly welcomed and meticulously treated by the Chinese people. This makes us feel like we are in the home of our relatives and friends. We have also seen the Chinese people's welcome to Burmese art, which is a manifestation of the further strengthening and consolidation of the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples.

U Ba Swe said, I would like to say that the friendly exchanges between our two countries have set an example in the world. If the relations between all countries in the world could be as friendly as ours, world peace could not fail to be realized.

The speeches of Vice Premier Chen Yi and leader U Ba Swe were warmly welcomed.

Those attending the banquet included: Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Vice Minister Xu Guangxiao, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Chu Tunan, Luo Jun, Chinese Ambassador to Burma Li Yimang, General Zhang Aiping of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General Gan Siqi, President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association Zhang Youyu, Vice President Jian Bozan, and famous figures from the cultural and artistic circles: Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Lao She, Zhou Erfu, Yuan Xuefen, Dai Ailian, and others.

Xinhua News Agency, August 13th—Vice Premiers of the State Council Chen Yi, Xi Zhongxun, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru received U Ba Swe, the leader of the Burmese Federal Cultural Friendship Art Troupe, and other leaders and main actors of the art troupe this afternoon, and held cordial and friendly talks with them.

    陈毅副总理对缅甸的艺术，给予很高评价，说缅甸的艺术具有浓厚的民族特色，缅甸艺术家们的表演技巧达到高度的境界。这是缅甸政府和人民重视、继承和发扬民族优秀文化传统的结果。他说，缅甸文化友好艺术团，不但是文化艺术的使者，而且是和平友好的使者。
    吴巴盛团长接着讲话。他说，我们这次应邀来中国访问的目的是把缅甸人民的友好愿望带到中国来。我们是把缅甸人民的友谊带到中国来的使者。

    吴巴盛说，我愿意说，我们两国的友好往来在世界上树立了范例。如果世界上所有的国家之间的关系都能够像我们这样的友好，世界和平是不可能不会实现的。
