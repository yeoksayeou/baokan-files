    The Hoes and Mattocks of Nanniwan

    These two rusty hoes and mattocks are tools used by Comrade Hao Shucai, a special-class labor model in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region during the Anti-Japanese War, in production in Nanniwan. He enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to carry out the great production movement. It was due to the hard work of these revolutionary fighters that the desolate Nanniwan in northern Shaanxi was transformed into a "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall."
      (Bai Shizao)

　　Opening up thousands of years of barren land,
　　Planting ten thousand acres of grains;
　　The enemy wants to trap the border region,
　　But the border region is filled with granaries.
　　How much harvest this ordinary iron hoe has won!
　　It once accompanied generals and soldiers,
　　Shedding how many drops of sweat.
　　Where does the owner who once held the hoe reside today?
　　Asking the north and south rivers,
　　Asking the distant and nearby mountains...
　　Ah! At the Ili River,
　　Ah! At Xingkai Lake,
　　The owner raises a new hoe,
　　Planting ten thousand red flowers!

    南泥湾的锄、镢头
    这两个生锈的锄头和镢头，是抗日战争时期陕甘宁边区特等劳动模范郝树财同志在南泥湾生产时使用的工具。他热烈地响应了党中央和毛主席关于开展大生产运动的号召。就是由于这些革命战士的辛勤劳动，把荒凉的陕北南泥湾，变成了塞北江南。
      （白世藻）翻开千年荒土，种植万顷五谷；贼寇想困倒边区，边区却布满粮库。这把普通铁锄，赢来多少收获！曾伴将领士兵，挥洒多少汗珠。当年握锄主人，今日居留何处？叩问南北河川，叩问远近山麓……啊！在伊犁河，啊！在兴凯湖，主人新锄高举，栽下红花万株！顾工  配诗
