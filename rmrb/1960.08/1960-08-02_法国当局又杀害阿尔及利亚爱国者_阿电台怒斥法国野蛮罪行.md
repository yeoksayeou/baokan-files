Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 30th: The French authorities brutally murdered Lakhelifi, a member of the Algerian National Liberation Front, in Lyon this morning, committing another act of violence against the Algerian people.

Lakhelifi and three other members of the National Liberation Front were sentenced to death by the French authorities in January on the so-called charge of "attacking a police station." Citizens of Lyon had written to the French President requesting that the death sentences of these Algerian patriots be commuted. *L'Humanité* pointed out that the actions of the citizens of Lyon showed that the French people opposed the French government's bloody policies.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 30th: The "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station strongly condemned the crime of the French imperialist authorities in executing Lakhelifi, a member of the Algerian National Liberation Front, tonight, and pointed out that this practice of disregarding world opinion and continuing the heinous war in Algeria cannot save French imperialism from collapse in Algeria.

The French authorities sentenced Lakhelifi and three other members of the Algerian National Liberation Front to death in January on the so-called charge of "attacking a police station." Disregarding protests and opposition from the public in various countries around the world, they brazenly murdered Lakhelifi in Lyon on the morning of the 30th.

The radio station pointed out that this is not the first time the French imperialist authorities have committed the crime of executing Algerian nationalists. They have been treating Algerian nationalists who fall into their hands in this way for the past six years.

The radio station pointed out that De Gaulle's murder of this Algerian nationalist is another demonstration to the world that he stubbornly wants to pursue a policy of war and implement barbaric policies in dealing with Algerian prisoners. The radio station said that without a doubt, world opinion will angrily condemn this cruel and barbaric act. "The end of all stubborn tyrants is sure to come."

West Africa's New Nation—Dahomey

Dahomey is located on the northern coast of the Gulf of Guinea. It is the smallest country in French West Africa, shaped like a narrow wedge between the soon-to-be-independent Nigeria and the already-independent Togo. It has an area of ​​112,000 square kilometers and a population of more than 1.7 million.

Dahomey's economic base is agriculture, and oil palm is its main economic crop. Exports of oil palm products account for 90% of Dahomey's total exports. It also produces cotton, peanuts, rice, bananas, etc. There are only some preliminary processing industries for agricultural products within the country.

Dahomey established its own kingdom in the early 17th century. From the 1760s onwards, French influence gradually infiltrated. In 1900, Dahomey completely became a French colony. In December 1958, according to De Gaulle's dictatorial constitution, Dahomey was declared an "autonomous republic" within the "French Community," but France still maintained control over its defense, diplomacy, finance, judiciary, education, and culture.

Due to long-term plunder by French colonists, the people of Dahomey live in extreme poverty. In recent years, exorbitant taxes and levies have continued to increase, and the poll tax has increased from 270 to 750 local francs. Workers' conditions are particularly bad, often starving or forced to beg from usurers. Under the cruel oppression and rule of the colonists, Dahomey's cultural and educational undertakings are extremely backward, with only 29% of school-age children attending school.

In recent years, the anti-colonialist struggle of the people of Dahomey has developed vigorously. In early 1958, workers at the main port of Cotonou, Dahomey, held a large-scale strike to oppose the colonial company's dismissal of workers, forcing the colonial company to revoke the dismissal order. After De Gaulle came to power, the call for independence from the people of Dahomey became even louder. Many political parties and groups put forward demands for independence and the elimination of the colonial system, and workers continued to launch strike struggles.

In June of this year, the leaders of four West African countries, Côte d'Ivoire, Dahomey, Niger, and Upper Volta, held talks with the French government in Paris and submitted a joint statement requesting independence within the French Community. In July, France had no choice but to agree to the independence of the four West African countries within the "French Community" and signed an agreement to transfer power. This independence is the result of the Dahomey people's opposition to colonialism and their struggle for national independence. In order to completely get rid of the control of colonial forces, they are continuing to wage a tenacious struggle in greater unity. (Xinhua News Agency)

    法国当局又杀害阿尔及利亚爱国者
    阿电台怒斥法国野蛮罪行
    新华社巴黎30日电　法国当局今天早上在里昂悍然杀害了阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线成员拉克利菲，从而对阿尔及利亚人民又犯下了一笔新的暴行。
    拉克利菲和民族解放阵线另外三个成员在今年1月间在所谓“袭击一个警察局”的罪名下被法国当局判处死刑。里昂市民曾写信给法国总统要求免除对这些阿尔及利亚爱国者的死刑。“人道报”指出，里昂市民的行动表明，法国人民反对法国政府的血腥政策。
    新华社开罗30日电　“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台今晚强烈谴责法帝国主义当局处死阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线成员拉克利菲的罪行，并指出，这种不顾世界舆论和坚持在阿尔及利亚继续进行罪恶战争的做法，决不能拯救法帝国主义在阿尔及利亚的崩溃。
    法国当局是在今年1月间以所谓“袭击一个警察局”的罪名判决拉克利菲和另外三个阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线成员死刑的。它不顾世界各国公众的抗议和反对，悍然于30日上午在里昂杀害了拉克利菲。
    电台指出，法帝国主义当局处死阿尔及利亚民族主义者的罪行这已不是第一次了。在过去六年中，它一直是这样对待落在它手中的阿尔及利亚民族主义者的。
    电台指出，戴高乐杀害这位阿尔及利亚民族主义者，是又一次在全世界面前证明他要顽固地奉行战争政策和在对待阿尔及利亚的俘虏方面执行野蛮政策。电台说，毫无疑问，世界舆论将会愤怒谴责这种残酷野蛮的行为。“一切顽固不化的暴君的末日肯定就要到来”。西非的一个新国家——达荷美
    达荷美位于几内亚湾的北岸，是法属西非最小的一个国家，它像一个狭长的楔子夹在即将独立的尼日利亚和已经取得独立的多哥之间。面积为十一万二千平方公里，人口一百七十多万。
    达荷美的经济基础是农业，油棕树是它的主要经济作物。油棕产品的出口值占达荷美出口总值的90％。此外还出产棉花、花生、大米、香蕉等。境内只有一些农产品初步的加工工业。
    十七世纪初期，达荷美就建立了自己的王国。自十七世纪六十年代起，法国势力逐渐侵入。1900年，达荷美全部沦为法国的殖民地。1958年12月，根据戴高乐独裁宪法，宣布达荷美为“法兰西共同体”内的一个“自治共和国”，但是法国仍然保持它在国防、外交、财经、司法和文教等方面的控制。
    由于法国殖民者长期掠夺，达荷美人民生活非常贫困。最近几年来。苛捐杂税不断增加，人头税已从二百七十增加到七百五十当地法郎。工人状况尤为恶劣，经常挨饿或被迫乞求于高利贷者。在殖民者残酷压迫统治下，达荷美的文化教育事业极其落后，学龄儿童上学的只占29％。
    近几年来，达荷美人民反殖民主义的斗争有了蓬勃的发展。1958年初，达荷美主要港口科托努港的工人，为反对殖民公司解雇工人，举行了大规模的罢工，迫使殖民公司撤销了解雇令。戴高乐上台后，达荷美人民要求独立的呼声更为响亮，许多政党和团体纷纷提出要求独立和消除殖民主义制度，工人们不断掀起罢工斗争。
    今年6月，西非象牙海岸、达荷美、尼日尔和上沃尔特等四国领导人在巴黎与法国政府举行了会谈，并递交一份联合声明，要求在法兰西共同体内独立；7月，法国不得不同意西非四国在“法兰西共同体”内独立，并签订了移交权力的协定。这一独立是达荷美人民反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的结果，为了完全摆脱殖民主义势力的控制，他们正在更加团结地继续进行顽强的斗争。　（新华社）
