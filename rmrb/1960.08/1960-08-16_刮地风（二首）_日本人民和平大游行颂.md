Gale (Two Poems)
    – In Praise of the Japanese People's Peace March
    Zhao Puchu

    (I)
    Going on pilgrimage in all directions, never before
    Such a scale:
    Two million two hundred thousand people all together
    On a ten-thousand-mile journey.
    Cloud banners and thunder drums,
    The whole city overflowing.
    The old and weak carrying pots of drink,
    Helping each other along, singing and crying.
    Sea waves turning into giant roars,
    Mountains shaking with joyful shouts,
    Truly stirring up a heaven-filling popular rage.

    (II)
    A raft floats from a distant shore in August,
    A grand meeting in Fusang.
    Sharing hatred, not fearing the long road,
    Holding hands, traveling together.
    Who buried Nagasaki?
    Who seized Okinawa?
    And stole a fine name –
    “Security Assurance”?
    A raging furnace melts iron deeds,
    A giant palm subdues the powerful and violent,
    Let's try the power of the people!

    ? The Japanese people's peace march, with a total of 2.2 million participants from all over the country, covered a distance of 10,000 kilometers.
    ? On August 5th, marching teams from all routes converged in Tokyo, and representatives from various countries attending the World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs participated in the march.

    刮地风（二首）
    ——日本人民和平大游行颂
    赵朴初
    （一）
    十方行脚向来无
    如此规模：
    二千二百万人俱
    万里征途。?
    云旗雷鼓，
    倾城盈谷。
    老弱壶浆，
    扶携歌哭。
    海波翻巨吼，
    山岳动欢呼，
    真掀起弥天众怒。
    （二）
    浮槎八月自遥方，
    胜会扶桑。
    同仇何惮道修长，
    携手同行。?
    长崎谁葬？
    冲绳谁攘？
    又窃佳名——
    “安全保障”？
    洪炉销铁券，
    巨掌制强梁，
    且一试人民力量！
    ?日本人民和平大游行，全国各地参加者二千二百万人，行程共达一万公里。
    ?八月五日各路游行队伍会师东京，出席禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会各国代表均参加游行。
