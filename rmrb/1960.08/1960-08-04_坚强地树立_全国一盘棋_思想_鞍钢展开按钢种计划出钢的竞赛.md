Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 3rd: Since June, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee has been educating steelmaking workers to firmly establish the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard," strictly adhere to producing the steel grades needed by the state, and vigorously reduce unplanned steel production. In June and July, the company's rate of producing steel according to steel grade plans increased by more than 5% on average compared to the period before May.

In order to achieve steel production according to planned steel grades, leaders at all factories, while delving into the production front lines to focus on steel output, have adopted many measures to promote the completion of steel grade plans. They prioritize the more difficult-to-smelt steel grades, ensuring that if the first shift fails to produce them, the second shift makes up for it. In addition to the Party Secretary and Factory Director going to the production front lines to focus on steel production according to steel grade plans, the First Steelmaking Plant also had two Deputy Party Secretaries and one Deputy Factory Director working alongside the shifts, focusing on three key aspects: precise material mixing for each furnace of steel, accurate composition, and timely tapping. The shift foremen of the plant's four shifts also communicated steel grade information during shift handovers, ensuring that workers in each shift were aware of the steel grade situation. As a result of these efforts, the plant's rate of producing steel according to steel grade plans in late July increased by 15% compared to mid-July. Li Tingshun, the Steelmaking Workshop Party Committee Secretary of the Second Steelmaking Plant, noticed that workers at one open-hearth furnace were eager to tap the steel. He personally inspected it and found that the carbon content of the molten steel was high. He then worked with the shift foreman, Wang Qingfu, to quickly reduce the carbon content, quickly bringing the carbon content of the molten steel to the level required by the state, avoiding an unplanned tapping.

In the past two months, workers in various steel plants have launched a competition to produce steel according to steel grade plans. The workers of Ding shift in the Second Steelmaking Plant implemented a "five-combination" approach involving the foreman, furnace leader, technician, raw material worker, and ingot worker, ensuring accurate composition of the molten steel in each furnace. From July 11th to 15th, they achieved a new record of producing steel entirely according to steel grade plans for five consecutive days. The other three shifts quickly caught up, leading to a gradual increase in the plant's rate of producing steel according to steel grade plans each ten-day period.

Personnel in ingot casting, raw materials, and laboratory departments of various steel plants, as well as various departments of the company, have actively supported and cooperated with the workers' efforts to produce steel according to steel grade plans. In early July, workers at one open-hearth furnace discovered a shortage of a high-grade alloy during steelmaking, threatening to lead to the production of unplanned steel. Upon learning of this, the company's Supply Department and Production Department immediately dispatched a vehicle to transport the high-grade alloy from the warehouse to the open-hearth furnace in a timely manner, saving a batch of high-quality steel.

### 坚强地树立“全国一盘棋”思想  鞍钢展开按钢种计划出钢的竞赛

    坚强地树立“全国一盘棋”思想
    鞍钢展开按钢种计划出钢的竞赛
    新华社鞍山3日电　鞍山钢铁公司党委从6月份以来，教育炼钢职工坚强地树立全国一盘棋思想，严格按国家需要的钢种进行生产，大力减少非计划出钢。6、7月两个月，全公司按钢种计划出钢率比5月以前平均提高了5％以上。
    为了作到按计划钢种出钢，各厂领导干部在深入生产前线抓钢产量的同时，都采取很多措施促进钢种计划完成。他们都把难炼的钢种排在前面，第一班出不来第二班要补上。第一炼钢厂除了党委书记和厂长到生产第一线抓按钢种计划出钢以外，两位党委副书记和一位副厂长还跟班劳动，狠抓每炉钢配好料、成份准、按时出等三大关键环节。这个厂四个班的值班工长在交接班时，也交钢种情况，使班班工人对钢种情况心中有数。经过这些努力，这个厂7月下旬按钢种计划出钢率比中旬提高了15％。第二炼钢厂炼钢车间工委书记李廷顺看到有一座平炉的工人急着要出钢，就亲自检查，发现钢水碳素较高，于是同值班工长王庆富一起操作，进行快速降碳，很快使钢水的含碳量达到国家要求，避免了一次非计划出钢。
    这两个月来，各钢厂职工开展了按钢种计划出钢的竞赛。第二炼钢厂丁班的职工实行工长、炉长、技术员、原料工人、铸锭工人“五结合”的办法，使炉炉钢水成分准确，7月11日到15日创造了连续五天全部按钢种计划出钢的新纪录。其他三班也急起直追，使全厂按钢种计划出钢率逐旬提高。
    各炼钢厂的铸锭、原料、化验方面的人员以及公司各个处，对工人们按钢种计划出钢，都积极主动地支援和配合。7月初，有一座平炉的工人在炼钢中发现一种高级合金不足，眼看要出非计划钢；这时公司的供应处和生产处知道了，立即派车把这种高级合金及时从仓库送到平炉上，挽救了一炉优质钢。
