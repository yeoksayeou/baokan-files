Xinhua News Agency, August 1st: Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin have launched an annihilation campaign to eliminate flies and mosquitoes.

In recent days, the masses in Beijing's urban and suburban areas have actively been exterminating mosquitoes and flies. Many districts and units have put forward the slogan "Everyone takes a swing, eliminating flies on sight," widely setting up fly traps and bait points, and universally swatting. Xuanwu District launched a "Fly Swatting Blitz Week." In Chunshu People's Commune, on the fly-killing high tide day, every household launched a comprehensive siege indoors, in courtyards, and on streets. In addition, more than 3,700 children formed more than 100 fly-swatting teams, swatting everywhere. The fly-swatting blitzkrieg achieved good results. The Nanliuxiang Residents' Committee, which previously had poor sanitation, now rarely sees flies.

The broad masses of Shanghai, on the basis of summing up the experience of the concentrated mosquito and fly extermination activity on the 17th of last month, have recently begun another more planned, organized, and prepared surge, centered on eliminating mosquitoes and flies and controlling summer infectious diseases. They have created a lot of experience in pest control methods and organizational measures, laying a good foundation for future transition to regular work. During the blitz activity on the 24th, in addition to continuing to widely set up poisoned fly bait points and mosquito traps and mosquito-killing vats, the broad masses conducted in-depth and meticulous searches for mosquitoes and flies in tree clumps, corners, attics, house corners, behind cabinets and boxes, and breeding grounds such as vegetable markets and livestock sheds. Many units, based on the life cycle of mosquitoes and flies, adopted the method of spraying greenery with drugs in the early morning and evening to kill mosquitoes and flies. Some areas have undergone a completely new look in sanitation after continuous and repeated blitzes.

Tianjin mobilized more than 500,000 people to participate in mosquito and fly extermination activities. From the 20th to the 23rd, each district also concentrated its efforts continuously, dividing areas and assigning responsibilities by sector to eliminate mosquitoes and flies. Each district disinfected the mosquito and fly breeding places that had been identified. The Hebei District Anti-epidemic Station and Wangchuanchang and other People's Communes disinfected an area of more than one million square meters in reed ponds and sewage pits, etc., mosquito and fly breeding grounds, within two days. The disinfection teams in Hexi District set up more than 2,280 smoke points in tree clumps and other places where mosquitoes easily hide, eliminating a large number of mosquitoes.

Many factories, government offices, and schools in these three major cities are also actively carrying out mosquito extermination activities. (Attached picture)

    人手一拍　见蝇就灭
    北京上海天津广大群众歼灭蚊蝇
    新华社1日讯　北京、上海、天津展开了灭蝇灭蚊的歼灭战。
    连日来，北京城区和近郊的广大群众积极扑灭蚊蝇。许多地区和单位提出“人手一拍，见蝇就灭”的口号，广设扑蝇笼、诱蝇点，普遍进行扑打。宣武区开展了“扑蝇突击周”，椿树人民公社在灭蝇高潮日里，家家户户在屋内、院外、街道展开全面围剿，另有三千七百多儿童组成一百多扑蝇队，到处扑打。灭蝇突击战役收到了良好效果。原来卫生工作较差的南柳巷居民委员会，现在也很少见到苍蝇了。
    上海市广大群众在总结上月17日围歼蚊蝇突击活动经验的基础上，最近又开始更有计划、有组织、有准备地掀起一次以消灭蚊蝇、控制夏季传染病为中心的突击高潮。在除害方法上、组织措施上创造了不少经验，为今后转入经常性的工作打下良好基础。在24日的突击活动中，广大群众除继续广设毒蝇点和诱蚊、灭蚊缸等外，深入细致搜捕树丛、墙角、阁楼、屋脚、橱箱后面等处和菜场、牲畜棚等孳生场所的蚊蝇。不少单位根据蚊蝇的生活规律，采取了在清晨、傍晚以药物喷洒绿化地带杀灭蚊蝇的办法。有些地区经过连续反复的突击，卫生面貌焕然一新。
    天津市出动五十多万大军参加了灭蚊灭蝇的活动。各区还分别在20日至23日，连续集中力量，划分地区，分片包干，消灭蚊蝇。各区对已经调查清楚的蚊蝇孳生处所，进行了消毒。河北区防疫站和王串场等人民公社在苇塘、污水坑等蚊蝇孳生地，两天内消毒面积达一百多万平方米。河西区的消毒队员在树丛等容易窝藏蚊子的地方，设立了两千二百八十多处烟熏点，消灭了大批蚊子。
    这三个大城市的许多工厂、机关、学校也在积极开展灭蚊活动。（附图片）
