    Cities' Enterprises Conserve Manpower to Head to the Countryside
    Hubei Selects Three Thousand Outstanding Cadres and Technicians to Settle in Communes to Strengthen Agricultural Leadership and Technical Forces
    Wuxi's Various Industries Vigorously Carry Out Technical Innovation, Conserving Over Ten Thousand People to Go to the Countryside to Participate in Agricultural Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. Hubei Province recently selected three thousand outstanding cadres and technical workers to settle down in rural people's communes, strengthening the communes' leadership and agricultural technology transformation capabilities. The first batch of cadres and technical workers heading to the Enshi mountainous area has already arrived at their destination, and all personnel going to the countryside will be distributed to various people's communes within days.
    Among the three thousand people going to the countryside, cadres and technical workers each account for half. The cadres are mainly drawn from directly subordinate organs of the province and from factories, mines, and enterprises, and organs in the five cities of Wuhan, Huangshi, Shashi, Yichang, and Xiangfan; the technical workers are mainly drawn from provincial, municipal, and regional-level industrial, transportation, basic construction, and processing enterprises. All units selected outstanding cadres with progressive political thinking, vigor, drive, a pragmatic style, and close ties with the masses to go to the countryside, of whom more than 80% are Party and League members. They also selected a certain number of professionals in accounting, statistics, and finance. The selected technical workers are all those needed in the countryside, such as turners, fitters, electricians, foundry workers, blacksmiths, assembly and repair workers, internal combustion engine workers, automobile drivers, and grain, cotton, and oil processing workers, with technical grades generally at level three or above, capable of independent operation. Among the cadres sent to the countryside by the directly subordinate industrial system of the province, 70% are leading backbone personnel, and 61% are advanced workers and other model figures. Many units, when selecting cadres to go to the countryside, carefully picked and chose within their own units, prioritizing the needs of the countryside as much as possible. The Hubei Provincial Department of Construction Industry, upon hearing that the countryside lacked financial backbone personnel, selected the only Party member deputy section chief in the Finance Section; the Hubei Provincial Department of Chemical Industry selected a fertilizer technician (Party member) to go to the countryside to support agriculture. The technical forces of various small factories in the Jiang'an District of Wuhan City were originally insufficient, but these factories universally selected their best technical personnel.
      According to the relevant instructions of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, since early July, various organs and factories in Hubei Province have been vigorously conducting propaganda and education among employees and cadres on comprehensively supporting agriculture and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. The broad masses of employees and cadres deeply recognized the importance of developing agriculture and actively signed up to go to the countryside to support agriculture. According to incomplete statistics, the number of people signing up to go to the countryside in each unit generally exceeded 95%, and many cadres and workers repeatedly requested to work in the most difficult places. Zhu Bensheng, a fourth-grade fitter at the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant, applied to the leadership to go to the countryside and used his spare time to familiarize himself with rural conditions by reading newspapers and agricultural machinery books, so that he could immediately play a role after arriving in the countryside.
    This group of cadres drawn to go to the countryside will serve as leading backbone personnel in the communes, to be used centrally by the communes in order to use them to solve key problems in production and impart technology. In order to enable the cadres and workers selected to go to the countryside to settle down and carry out their work smoothly, the sending units and the receiving units jointly arranged their household affairs in advance.
    Our newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd. Following the dispatch of more than 1,700 cadres and workers to settle in the countryside in March and May of this year, the broad masses of employees in various industries in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, have once again drawn out 15,000 people through vigorously carrying out technical revolution and tapping labor potential, and have sent them to various people's communes in Wuxi County to participate in agricultural production.
    The recent action of Wuxi City to draw a batch of manpower to the countryside to participate in agricultural production was developed on the basis of the propaganda and education movement of "taking agriculture as the foundation." In the past month, Party committees at all levels have vigorously carried out propaganda and education on "taking agriculture as the foundation" for employees through making reports, holding symposiums, and organizing visits, further enhancing the masses' awareness of supporting agriculture.
    Under the leadership of Party organizations, employees of various factories and enterprises have taken their enthusiasm for supporting agriculture as the ideological driving force for deeply carrying out technical revolution, focusing on current production, vigorously carrying out technical innovation, increasing labor productivity, and tapping labor potential. Various machinery factories have saved a batch of labor force by improving the degree of "four modernizations" and other methods. When processing grinder parts, the Fifth Workshop of Wuxi Machine Tool Plant changed manual operation to modularization, increasing work efficiency by more than twenty times; the entire plant promoted the experience of this workshop, vigorously carried out technical innovation, and drew out a total of 186 people to go to the countryside to participate in production. Various textile factories have also saved a large amount of labor by expanding the capacity of the stands and carrying out "all-rounder" activities, with Qingfeng Textile Factory alone drawing out 346 people. Other light industrial factories have also vigorously promoted advanced experience and tapped labor potential. Various factories and enterprises have also saved labor by adjusting department structures and workshop labor organizations. After the adjustment of the department structure of Shenxin Textile Factory, it not only improved work efficiency but also drew out 35 non-production personnel. Commercial, cultural, and educational departments in the city have also drawn out a batch of labor force. A total of 15,000 people have been drawn out in the city this time, with a relatively large number of non-production personnel and apprentices, and 80% of the people sent to the countryside in the machinery industry system are non-production personnel.

    城市企业节约人力开赴农村
    湖北选拔三千优秀干部和技工到公社落户加强农业领导力量和技术力量
    无锡各行业大闹技术革新节约万余人下乡参加农业生产
    新华社武汉讯　湖北省最近选拔了三千名优秀干部和技术工人到农村人民公社安家落户，增强公社的领导力量和农业技术改造力量。第一批到恩施山区的干部和技术工人已经到达目的地，日内全部下乡人员即可分头到达各人民公社。
    下乡的三千人中，干部和技术工人各占一半。干部主要是从省直属机关和武汉、黄石、沙市、宜昌、襄樊五个城市的厂矿企业、机关抽调的；技术工人主要从省、市、地专一级工业、交通、基本建设、加工等企业抽调。各单位都选拔政治思想进步、有朝气、有干劲、作风朴实、联系群众的优秀干部到农村去，其中党团员占80％以上，还选调了一定数量的会计、统计、财务方面的专业人员。选调的技术工人，都是农村需要的车工、钳工、电工、铸工、锻工、装配修理、内燃机、汽车司机、粮棉油加工工人等，技术等级一般在三级以上，能够独立操作。省直属工业系统抽调下乡的干部有70％是领导骨干，61％是先进工作者等模范人物。许多单位在选拔下乡干部的时候，都在本单位挑了又挑，选了又选，尽可能优先满足农村需要。湖北省建筑工业厅听说农村缺乏财经方面的骨干力量，把财务科仅有的一名党员副科长选拔出来；湖北省化学工业厅选调了化肥技术员（党员）下乡支援农村。武汉市江岸区各小型工厂技术力量本来不足，但这些工厂普遍都把最好的技术人员抽调了出来。
      湖北省各机关、工厂根据中共湖北省委的有关指示，7月上旬以来就大张旗鼓地向职工、干部进行了全面支援农业、加强工农联盟的宣传教育。广大职工、干部深刻地认识到了发展农业的重要意义，纷纷报名要求到农村去支援农业，据不完全统计，各单位报名下乡的人数一般都在95％以上，很多干部和工人三番两次要求到最艰苦的地方去工作。武汉重型机床厂四级钳工朱本生向领导上申请去农村后，就利用业余时间找报纸熟悉农村情况，阅读农业机械书籍，以便到农村后能立即发挥作用。
    这批抽调下乡的干部，将到公社担任领导骨干，由公社集中使用，以便利用他们来解决生产中的关键问题、传授技术。为了使选调下乡的干部和工人到农村去安家落户后能顺利地进行工作，抽调单位与接受单位事先共同为他们安排好了家务。
    本报南京23日电　江苏省无锡市各行各业继今年3月和5月抽调一千七百多名干部和工人到农村安家落户以后，全市广大职工又通过大搞技术革命，挖掘劳动潜力，在最近抽调出一万五千人奔赴无锡县各人民公社参加农业生产。
    无锡市最近抽调一批人力到农村参加农业生产的行动，是在“以农业为基础”的宣传教育运动基础上发展起来的。最近一个月来，各级党委通过做报告、开座谈会、组织参观等方式，大张旗鼓地对职工进行了“以农业为基础”的宣传教育，进一步提高了群众支援农业的自觉性。
    各工厂企业职工在党组织领导下，都把支援农业的热情，作为深入开展技术革命的思想动力，围绕当前生产，大搞技术革新，提高劳动生产率，挖掘劳动潜力。各机械工厂通过提高“四化”程度等办法，节省出一批劳动力。无锡机床厂第五车间在加工磨床的零件时，把手工操作改为模具化，使工效提高二十倍以上；全厂推广了这个车间的经验，大搞技术革新，共抽出了一百八十六人去到农村参加生产。各纺织厂通过扩大看台能力、开展“多面手”活动等办法，也节约了大批劳力，仅庆丰纺织厂就抽出了三百四十六人。其他轻工业工厂也大力推广先进经验，挖掘劳动潜力。各工厂企业还通过调整科室机构和车间劳动组织等方法，节省劳力。申新纺织厂科室部门调整后，既提高了工作效率，又抽出三十五个非生产人员。全市商业、文教等部门，也都抽出了一批劳动力。全市这次共抽出一万五千人，其中较多的是非生产人员和徒工，机械工业系统下乡人员中，80％是非生产人员。
