    Random Thoughts
    Shan Jiushan
    Most of the workers in the Wang Jinshan Production Team of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company came from the countryside. The leading cadres often said to the workers: "A box of matches only costs a fraction of a cent. In our homes (referring to the countryside), several people smoke together, only using one match. If there is a fire basin or stove nearby, even this match is not needed. Construction also requires careful calculation; we must be as meticulous as saving every match."

    Increasing production and practicing economy requires this spirit of careful calculation. The more meticulous and detailed we are, the more we demonstrate a sense of responsibility towards our work.

    Life should be simple and frugal, and production should also be diligent and thrifty. "Diligence can make up for clumsiness, and frugality nourishes integrity." Diligence and thrift not only increase production and conserve resources materially, but also make people's minds sharper and healthier in spirit.

    Diligence and thrift are two aspects of increasing material wealth. Diligence and thrift, increasing income and reducing expenditure, are an interconnected whole. Thrift without diligence naturally cannot create wealth; diligence without thrift wastes effort. The Chinese people have many good habits of diligence and thrift. Applying these to production and construction, striving for strength and self-improvement, anything can be done well.

    随感录

    石景山钢铁公司王近山生产队职工大部分是农村来的。领导干部常常对工人们说：“一盒火柴才一两分钱，咱们家里（指农村）几个人一起抽烟，只用一根火柴，要是旁边有火盆或炉子，连这根火柴也不用了。搞建设也得精打细算，要像节约每一根火柴一样精打细算。”
    增产节约，很需要这种精打细算的精神。越是精，越是细，也就越加表现了对事业的负责精神。
    生活上要艰苦朴素，生产上也要克勤克俭。“勤能补拙，俭以养廉”勤俭不只是在物质上能够增产节约，而且在精神上也能使人们的头脑聪敏和健康起来。
    勤和俭是增加物质财富的两个方面，克勤克俭，开源节流，是联系在一起的整体。只俭不勤，自然不能创造出财富；勤而不俭，也枉费其勤。我国人民有很多勤俭的好习惯，把这些都用到生产上去，用到建设事业上去，发愤图强，刻苦自励，任何事情都是可以办好的。
