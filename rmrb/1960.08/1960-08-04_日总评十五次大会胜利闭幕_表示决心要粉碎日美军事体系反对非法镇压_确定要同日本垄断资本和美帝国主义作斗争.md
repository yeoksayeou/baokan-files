Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd dispatch: The All-Japan Federation of Trade Unions (Sohyo)’s 15th Regular Congress concluded victoriously today.

The congress declaration, unanimously adopted, firmly stated that Sohyo will combine the struggle to smash the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" system with the struggle against illegal suppression and against the Ikeda Cabinet.

The declaration pointed out that Sohyo's 15th Congress was convened to further develop the great achievements of the struggle against the "Security Treaty" and the struggle of the Miike coal miners. The declaration said that Sohyo-affiliated workers are proud to play a "pillar" role in this important struggle. The emergence of this situation in Japan is not only a national issue for Japan but is also closely related to changes in the international situation and further directly affects imperialist forces.

The declaration pointed out that, due to the signing of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," Japan's peace and independence are facing a serious crisis.

The declaration emphasized that we must continue to develop the united action formed in the struggle against the "Security Treaty" and strive to achieve the unity and solidarity of the working class. Only in this way can victory be guaranteed.

The declaration also stated: At the same time, we must strive for victory in the general election and fight for the establishment of a peaceful, neutral, and democratic government.

The congress also unanimously adopted five resolutions on strengthening the solidarity of the working class, supporting the struggle of workers in small and medium-sized enterprises, supporting the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," and smashing illegal suppression.

The congress passed a letter of encouragement, expressing support for the struggle of Indian government employees; the congress also passed a letter of protest to the Indian government, protesting the Indian government's large-scale arrest of workers.

Amidst enthusiastic applause from all participants, the congress unanimously passed an emergency resolution requesting the Japanese government to agree to extend the visiting time of the Chinese delegation in Japan by two weeks.

The congress re-elected Kaoru Ota as Chairman of Sohyo and elected Akira Imamura, Yoshinobu Kadoma, Tomitaro Kaneta, Shun Oide, and Kazuma Noguchi as Vice-Chairmen. Akira Iwai was re-elected as Secretary-General.

Sohyo Chairman Kaoru Ota, on behalf of the newly formed leadership, firmly stated that Sohyo workers will fight to the end to smash the "Security Treaty" system and the low-wage system.

Sohyo Vice-Chairman Tomitaro Kaneta emphasized in his closing remarks that, due to the participation of foreign trade union representatives, this congress has become a congress of great significance, especially the fact that the congress was able to welcome the Chinese delegation, which visited Japan for the first time in more than two years, is of great significance.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd dispatch: The 15th Regular Congress of the All-Japan Federation of Trade Unions passed the 1960 action policy. The new action policy stipulates that Sohyo will continue to launch a struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" system based on the achievements of the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance and various struggles of the working class in the past year.

The policy emphasized that the focus of this year's labor movement is: opposing fascism; safeguarding democracy; striving for the abolition of the new "Security Treaty" and striving for peace; and eliminating poverty.

The action policy also clearly stipulates that Sohyo will not only fight against Japanese monopoly capital but also fight against U.S. imperialism.

Sohyo Secretary-General Akira Iwai emphasized at the meeting that U.S. imperialism supports Japan's first enemy, Japanese monopoly capital, from behind the scenes. Therefore, it is only natural for us to fight against it. Akira Iwai's speech received thunderous applause from all participants.

Regarding relations with political parties, the action policy stipulates: Sohyo supports the Socialist Party and will also establish cooperative relations with other progressive parties on various issues.

The congress also passed a policy to further strengthen the international solidarity of the working class. The policy clearly stipulates that Sohyo will faithfully fulfill the joint statements and agreements issued by Sohyo delegations with trade unions in countries such as the Soviet Union, China, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic; it will strive to develop the common struggle of Japanese workers with workers in Asia and Africa aimed at achieving comprehensive disarmament, opposing nuclear armament, abolishing military bases, and forcing the withdrawal of U.S. troops from foreign countries.

The policy also clearly stipulates that it will focus on launching a struggle to regain workers' rights, including regaining the right to strike for public officials, striving for the repeal of laws prohibiting political activities, and opposing the malicious revision of labor laws.

On the 1st, after heated discussions, the congress unanimously adopted the report on Sohyo's work in the past year made by Sohyo Secretary-General Akira Iwai to the congress.

On the 1st, the congress also unanimously passed a letter to the government's Japan Central Labor Relations Commission, requesting it to propose a fair mediation plan for the labor-management dispute at the Miike coal mine.

On the 1st and 2nd, Japanese and foreign representatives continued to deliver congratulatory messages to the congress.

    宣言指出，总评第十五次大会的召开是为了继续发展反对“安全条约”斗争的巨大成就和三池煤矿工人的斗争。宣言说，总评所属工人对于在这个重要斗争中能够起“支柱”作用这一点感到自豪。日本这种形势的出现不仅是日本一个国家的问题，而且同国际形势的变化有着密切的关系，并进一步对帝国主义势力发生直接影响。
    宣言指出，但是由于签订了新的日美“安全条约”，日本的和平和独立正面临着严重的危机。
    宣言强调指出，我们必须继续发展在反对“安全条约”斗争中所形成的统一行动，争取实现工人阶级的统一和团结。只有这样才有胜利的保证。
    宣言还说：同时必须争取大选胜利和为建立和平、中立、民主的政府而奋斗。
    大会还一致通过了关于加强工人阶级团结、关于支援中小企业工人斗争、关于支援“松川事件”无辜被告、粉碎非法镇压等五项决议。
    大会通过鼓舞信，表示支持给印度政府雇员的斗争；大会并且通过了对印度政府的抗议书，抗议印度政府大肆逮捕工人。

    总评议长太田熏代表新组成的领导机构坚决表示，总评工人要为粉碎“安全条约”体系和低工资制度而斗争到底。
    总评副议长兼田富太郎在致闭幕词中强调指出，由于外国工会代表的参加，这次大会成为具有重要意义的大会，尤其是大会能够迎接两年多以来第一次前来访日的中国代表这个意义是巨大的。
    据新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会第十五次定期大会通过了1960年度运动方针。新运动方针规定，总评将在一年来反对日美军事同盟斗争和工人阶级各次斗争成就的基础上，继续展开粉碎日美“安全条约”体系的斗争。
    方针强调指出，今年度工人运动的重点在于：反对法西斯主义；维护民主；争取废除新“安全条约”和争取和平；消灭贫穷。
    运动方针还明确规定，总评不仅对日本垄断资本、也要同美帝国主义进行斗争。
    总评事务局长岩井章在会上强调说，美帝国主义从幕后支持日本工人第一个敌人——日本垄断资本。因此我们和它进行斗争这是理所当然的。岩井章的发言受到了全体与会者雷动般的鼓掌。
    关于同政党的关系，运动方针规定：总评支持社会党，同时要与其他革新政党就各个问题建立合作关系。
    大会还通过了进一步加强工人阶级国际团结的方针。方针明确规定，总评要忠实履行总评各个代表团分别同苏联、中国、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国等国家的工会发表的共同声明和协议；要努力发展以争取全面裁军、反对核武装、撤销军事基地、迫使美军撤出外国为目标的日本工人同亚非各国工人的共同斗争。
    方针并且明确规定，将着重展开夺还工人权利的斗争，包括夺还公务人员的罢工权利、争取撤销禁止政治活动的法律、反对恶劣修改劳动法律的斗争。
