Xinhua News Agency, Vancouver - The Chinese Art Troupe held its first performance in North America at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre on the evening of the 10th, achieving great success. The largest theater in Vancouver, with 2,800 seats, was packed.

British Columbia Premier Bennett and his wife, government officials from the province and the city of Vancouver, the head of the Vancouver International Theatre Festival, well-known figures in the literary and art circles, and other audience members welcomed and praised the long-awaited Chinese Art Troupe's first performance in Vancouver with extremely warm applause. During the intermission, many people believed that the Chinese Art Troupe's performance in Vancouver was a victory for the Vancouver Theatre Festival.
