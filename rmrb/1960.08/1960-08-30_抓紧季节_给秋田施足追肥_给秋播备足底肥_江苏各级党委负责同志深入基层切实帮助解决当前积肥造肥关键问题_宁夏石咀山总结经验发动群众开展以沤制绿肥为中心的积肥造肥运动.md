Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 29th. Party committee leaders at all levels in rural Jiangsu are going deep into the front lines of manure accumulation in a down-to-earth manner, and are practically solving key current problems in manure accumulation and production.

	Liu Xigeng, First Secretary of the Xuzhou Prefectural Party Committee, in order to understand the situation of fertilizer production and accumulation, went to Jiangzhuang Production Team of Paohe Commune in Xinyi County on August 12th, together with Yi Shibin, First Secretary of the County Party Committee, secretaries Bao Youcheng and Geng Chao, as well as all the First Secretaries of the commune Party committees. Through observation and discussion, they summarized many successful experiences. Judging from the team's current fertilizer situation, it is still more than half short of the requirement. The three-level secretaries analyzed and studied the team's situation, and everyone had a clear understanding of how much fertilizer there was, how much was lacking, and whether the fertilizer quality was high or not. On the basis of investigation and research, five action measures were determined: First, manure accumulation must involve a large-scale mass movement, and the existing natural ponds must be fully utilized. As long as all the weeds, green grass, and mixed soil on the roadside and pondside are cleaned up and removed within five to seven days, and all the compost ponds are filled, the amount of fertilizer can be increased by two to three times. Second, universally promote the "three-connected ponds" (san lián táng), and manage the existing livestock pens, liquid manure ponds, and toilets well. Third, immediately establish and improve specialized manure accumulation teams, and implement a "five-fixed" responsibility system: fixed personnel, fixed ponds, fixed remuneration, fixed quantity, and fixed quality. The fertilizer accumulated by commune members' families must be firmly given work points or priced according to quality, and cashed out once a month. Fourth, formulate manure accumulation and production targets at all levels, mobilize the masses to fully discuss them, and implement them in production teams and fields. Fifth, adapt to local conditions and improve manure accumulation and production techniques to improve fertilizer efficiency. The above measures have effectively promoted the current manure accumulation and production movement throughout the region after they were implemented in various places.

	Not long ago, the Wujin County Party Committee studied the situation of topdressing for autumn fields in the county. The prominent problems at present are the insufficient inventory of fertilizer for late rice ear fertilizer application and the fact that some cadres are not grasping the work of manure accumulation and production tightly enough. To meet the needs of rice topdressing in the shortest possible time, it is necessary to first solve the fertilizer source problem. Qian Mengwu, First Secretary of the County Party Committee, went deep into Minghuang Commune, participated in labor, and conducted in-depth investigation and research on the issue of fertilizer sources. The investigation confirmed that green grass is the richest source of fertilizer at present. There is abundant grass everywhere on the mountains, riverbanks, field edges, and open spaces. Cutting a large amount of green grass and composting it on the spot directly in the fields for green manure saves labor and time, and can quickly meet the needs of rice field topdressing. In order to solve the ideological problem of some people thinking that green manure cannot replace quick-acting fertilizer, Secretary Qian personally sharpened his sickle, carried a grass basket, cut more than 300 jin of green grass, and led cadres and commune members to "chiao qing cao" (樵青草, namely, tying green grass into small bundles and burying them under the rice roots) and did a "one step into the field" experiment on more than 20 mu of late rice fields in the Qianjiatang Production Team. A few days later, these late rice fields were lush and growing vigorously. Secretary Qian first held an on-site meeting in Minghuang Commune to promote this practice, and then, after collective research by the County Party Committee, quickly promoted the experience of "chiao qing cao" directly into the fields throughout the county.

	The manure accumulation specialized team of Hongze Brigade, Dianxi Commune, Kunshan County, is a "double-high" (high speed, high standard) manure accumulation pacesetter team famous throughout the commune. In the ten days of early August, they dredged more than 300,000 dan of aquatic plants from Dianshan Lake. Now, the 6,000 mu of late rice in this brigade have generally been topdressed with ear fertilizer once, and the growth is very good. This "double-high" achievement is closely related to Secretary Qian.

	One day in late July, Qian Zaigui, First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, went to Hongze Brigade to inspect fertilizer application work. By the shore of Dianshan Lake, he saw that all the agricultural boats were using the old methods of pulling aquatic plants from previous years, which was both laborious and inefficient. He calculated in his mind: according to the old method, one boat could only get at most 100 dan of aquatic plants a day, which was only enough for topdressing one mu of rice. Hongze Brigade only had 110 boats, and it would take two months to accumulate enough ear fertilizer for 6,000 mu of late rice. How could this be possible? He went to the boat, dredged aquatic plants with the commune members, and chatted with them. From the chat, he found a way to use large double knives and use the power of sailboats to dredge aquatic plants. That night, Secretary Qian rushed back to the commune and mobilized the workers of the iron industry cooperative to rush to make more than a dozen large double knives. The practice in the past ten days has proved that using large double knives to cut aquatic plants for manure accumulation is a new method of accumulating fertilizer in large lakes in a faster, better, and more economical way.

	The above examples once again illustrate that a down-to-earth style of work by cadres can lead to a vigorous mass movement.

	According to the Ningxia Daily, the Shizuishan Working Committee of the Communist Party of China has seized the great opportunity of lush growth of all kinds of grasses, and has adopted the method of large-scale mobilization, large-scale harvesting, large-scale cleaning, and large-scale composting to carry out a city-wide composting pit network movement centered on composting green manure, with "one pit per household, two pits per dining hall, three pits per pen, and five pits per hundred mu". A large amount of fertilizer has been accumulated and produced, and 174,400 cartloads of fertilizer have been accumulated and produced in twelve days.

	Before launching this manure accumulation and production movement, Yang Zhengxi, First Secretary of the Shizuishan Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhao Zhong, Secretary of the Secretariat, went to the Weizha, Huangquqiao, and Baofeng communes to inspect the situation of manure accumulation and production, and held discussions with cadres at all levels of the communes to study the experiences and methods of manure accumulation and production, and helped the communes to conduct a fertilizer inventory. Based on investigation and research, on August 9, the Shizuishan Working Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice to the commune Party committees on carrying out a shock campaign for manure accumulation and production, requiring party organizations at all levels to firmly grasp the annual "harvest season" for green manure, and to prepare more than 50% of the fertilizer needed for next year in the two months of August and September. According to past experience in manure accumulation and production, mixing human and animal manure with weeds and garbage in a pit for composting is a faster, better, and more economical way to produce organic fertilizer. Therefore, the Shizuishan Working Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed: levels of responsibility, everyone should take action, combining with the central task of current autumn field management, a large amount of green manure should be collected, and everyone should make a point of going out with one rope, and going home with a bundle of grass. The army participating in autumn field management is also the army to promote green fertilizer in a big way. At the same time, they should vigorously promote pig raising and manure accumulation, mixing pig manure with various weeds and stalks for composting, and implement the combination of one pen and one pit in a planned way. Rural office cadres and older students should actively accumulate and produce manure, taking manure accumulation and production as a major part of supporting agricultural production. In order to strengthen the leadership of manure accumulation and production, the working groups of the Working Committee, the commune Party committees, and the brigade general branches quickly implemented the manure accumulation plan down to the pit and assigned tasks to individuals and households.

	The party organizations of various communes and brigades immediately took active action in accordance with the instructions of the Working Committee. Gao Dengxuan, secretary of the Tuanjie Brigade General Branch, went deep into the No. 8 small team, which was relatively poor in manure accumulation, to set up fertilizer experimental fields. The entire small team dug 18 new composting pits in two days and rectified the pen sheds. Now, six pits have been composted (50 cartloads of fertilizer per pit), making it the fastest small team in manure accumulation in the entire brigade. The Huangquqiao Commune's Qianjin Brigade General Branch designated a deputy secretary to specifically grasp fertilizer work, and deputy captains and deputy group leaders were responsible for this work in the small team and work group. While ensuring autumn field management and other farm work, this team drew 170 people to specialize in manure accumulation. In addition, 68 strong laborers were transferred from service industries and other aspects to invest in manure accumulation and autumn field management. On August 6, there were 316 composting pits in the team, and this increased to 406 by the 11th. Yang Shengmao, Secretary of the Baofeng Commune Party Committee, and Mao Jinfu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Party Committee and director of the commune, went deep into various small teams to check, summarize, and promote the advanced experience of manure accumulation and production. They went to the No. 2 small team of the Miaotai Brigade and found that the quality of the compost was not good. Some were only composting ash soil, some were only composting manure, and some used too little water, so the compost was dry. Therefore, they helped them change the method of composting and promoted the advanced experience of mixing manure and grass.

	The Shizuishan City’s large-scale composting pit network movement has quickly achieved results. Now, the number of livestock pen composting pits has increased from 1,670 at the end of July to 1,774, the number of field composting pits has soared from more than 200 to 780, the number of commune members' family composting pits has reached 3,934, 207 new dining hall composting pits have been built, 71 pig pen composting pits, and 68 other composting pits.

    江苏各级党委负责同志深入基层切实帮助解决当前积肥造肥关键问题  宁夏石咀山总结经验发动群众开展以沤制绿肥为中心的积肥造肥运动
    本报南京29日电　江苏农村各级党委负责同志，扎扎实实地深入积肥第一线，切实解决当前积肥造肥的关键问题。
    中共徐州地委第一书记刘锡庚同志，为了摸清造肥积肥情况，8月12日在新沂县，同县委第一书记伊世彬、书记鲍友成、耿超以及全县的公社党委第一书记，深入到炮车公社蒋庄生产队，通过边看边议，总结了不少成功的经验。从这个队现有肥料情况看，与要求还差一半多。三级书记就这个队的情况作了分析研究，大家对有多少肥，缺多少肥，肥料质量高不高，心里有了底。在调查研究的基础上，确定了五项行动措施：第一、积肥必须大搞群众运动、把现有自然汪塘充分利用起来，只要在五到七天内，把路边、塘边所有的杂草、青草、杂土全部锄净铲光，把所有沤肥塘填满，就可以增加二到三倍的肥料。第二、普遍推广三连塘，把现有牲畜圈、水粪塘、厕所管好。第三、立即建立健全积肥专业队，实行定人、定塘、定报酬、定数量、定质量的五定责任制。社员家庭积的肥，坚决给评工分，或按质论价，一月一兑现。第四、层层制订积肥造肥指标，发动群众充分讨论，落实到生产队，落实到田。第五、因时因地制宜，改进积肥造肥技术，提高肥效。上述措施在各地贯彻后，有力地促进了当前全区的积肥造肥运动。
    不久以前，中共武进县委研究了全县的秋田追肥的情况。当前突出的问题是，重施晚稻穗肥库存肥料不足和一部分干部对积肥造肥工作抓得不紧。要在最短期间满足水稻追肥的需要，必须首先解决肥源问题。县委第一书记钱梦梧同志深入到鸣凰公社，一边参加劳动，一边就肥源问题进行了深入的调查研究。调查结果肯定了青草是当前最丰富的肥源，山上、河边、田边、隙地，到处百草丛生。大割青草，“一步下田”，就地沤制绿肥，既省劳力，又省时间，可以迅速满足稻田追肥需要。为了解决一部分人认为绿肥不能代替速效肥的思想问题，钱书记亲自磨快镰刀，身背草篮，割青草三百多斤，带动干部和社员一起樵青草（即将青草扎成小把子埋到稻根下）并在钱家塘生产队的二十多亩晚稻田中，做了“一步下田”的试验。几天后，这些晚稻一片乌油油，生长健壮。钱书记先在鸣凰公社召开现场会议推广这一做法，接着，又经过县委集体研究，迅速在全县推广了樵青草一步下田的经验。
    昆山县淀西公社虹泽大队的积肥专业队，是一个全社闻名的“双高”（高速度、高标准）积肥标兵队。他们在8月上旬的十天中，就从淀山湖里捞了三十多万担水草。现在这个大队的六千亩晚稻，已普遍重施了一次穗肥，长势很好。这个“双高”的成绩和钱书记有很大关系。
    7月下旬的一天，公社党委第一书记钱再桂同志，到虹泽大队检查施肥工作。在淀山湖边，他看到所有的农船都是用往年那几种老办法拉水草，既费力，工效又不高。他心里划算：照老办法，一天一条船顶多搞一百担水草，只够一亩水稻的追肥，虹泽大队只有一百一十条船，要积足六千亩晚稻的穗肥，要花两个月时间，这怎么能行？他到船上去，一边同社员一起捞水草，一边和他们漫谈。从漫谈中找到了一个使用大双刀、利用帆船的动力来捞水草的办法，当晚，钱书记又赶回公社，动员铁业社的工人们赶制了十多把大双刀。十多天来的实践证明：利用大双刀割水草积肥，是大湖里多快好省的积肥新办法。
    上述几个事例再次说明：干部作风踏踏实实，群众运动就能轰轰烈烈。
    本报讯　据宁夏日报消息：中共石咀山工委狠抓当前百草茂盛的大好时机，采取大动员、大收、大扫除、大沤的办法，在全市范围内开展了以沤造绿肥为中心的、一户一坑、一堂（食堂）二坑、一圈三坑、百亩五坑的沤肥坑网化运动，大积大造肥料，十二天内已积造肥料十七万四千四百车。
    在这次开展积肥造肥运动以前，中共石咀山工委第一书记杨正喜、书记处书记赵忠，到尾闸、黄渠桥、宝丰三个公社，检查了积肥造肥情况，和公社各级干部座谈，研究了积肥造肥的经验和方法，帮助各公社进行了肥料摸底算账。在调查研究的基础上，8月9日，中共石咀山工委向各公社党委发出了开展积肥造肥突击运动的通知，要求各级党组织狠狠抓住一年一度的绿肥“丰收季节”，在8、9两个月内准备好明年所需肥料的50％以上。根据过去积肥造肥经验，用人畜粪同杂草垃圾在一个坑里混合沤制，是大搞有机质肥料的一个多快好省的办法。因此中共石咀山工委提出：层层负责，人人动手，结合当前秋田管理的中心工作，大搞绿肥，做到人人出工一根绳、收工一捆草，参加秋田管理的大军也是大搞绿肥的大军。同时，大搞养猪积肥，把猪的粪便与各种杂草、蒿秆混合沤制，有计划地实行一圈一坑、坑舍结合。在农村的机关干部和年龄较大的学生，都要积极积肥造肥，把积肥造肥作为支援农业生产的一项主要内容。为了加强对积肥造肥的领导，工委下乡工作组、公社党委、大队总支迅速把积肥计划落实到坑、任务安排到人到户。
    各公社、大队党组织立即按照工委的指示，积极行动起来。团结大队总支书记高登选，深入到积肥较差的八小队搞肥料试验田，全小队两天时间就新挖了十八个沤肥坑，整顿了圈棚。现在，已经沤制肥料的有六个坑（一坑五十车肥），成为全大队积肥行动最快的一个小队。黄渠桥公社前进大队总支确定副书记专门抓肥料工作，小队、作业组由副队长、副组长负责这项工作。这个队在保证秋田管理和其他农活的前提下，抽出了一百七十人专门积肥，另外还从服务行业等方面调出六十八个强劳力，投入积造肥料和秋田管理，全队沤肥坑8月6日有三百一十六个，到11日就增加到四百零六个。宝丰公社党委书记杨生茂，党委常委、社长毛金福等都深入到各小队，检查和总结推广积肥造肥的先进经验。他们到庙台大队二小队，发现沤肥质量不好，有的光沤灰土，有的光沤粪，有的洒水少，沤出的肥料干，于是便帮助他们改变了沤肥方法，推广了粪草混沤的先进经验。
    石咀山市大搞沤肥坑网化运动迅速取得了成效。现在，畜圈沤肥坑已由7月底的一千六百七十个增加到一千七百七十四个，田头沤肥坑由二百多个猛增到七百八十个，社员家庭沤肥坑达到三千九百三十四个，新建食堂沤肥坑二百零七个，猪圈沤肥坑七十一个，其他沤肥坑六十八个。（附图片）
