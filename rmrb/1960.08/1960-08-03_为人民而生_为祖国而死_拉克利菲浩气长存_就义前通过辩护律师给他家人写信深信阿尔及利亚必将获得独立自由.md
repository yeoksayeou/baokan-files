Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 1st. Parisian newspapers published a letter from Rakhlifi, a member of the Algerian National Liberation Front, to his family. Rakhlifi was killed by the French authorities in Lyon on July 30th. This letter was passed on by Rakhlifi through his defense lawyer before his execution.

In his letter, he said: "Dear Father, I am about to die for my country... I will die like many of my brothers... I was born for my people. I fight for the independence of my country. As I am about to die, I am convinced that my country will become independent and free."

Rakhlifi's three defense lawyers issued a statement accusing the French authorities of fabricating charges to kill Rakhlifi and other Algerian patriots.

The statement exposed the torture suffered by Rakhlifi and others persecuted with him in Lyon prison, stating:

"A doctor named Martin confirmed that after forty-five days, the scars from electric shocks could still be seen on their bodies."

The statement emphasized that these Algerian patriots were all deprived of the right to be defended by the defenders they had chosen.

News reaching Paris yesterday said that on the same day that Rakhlifi and other Algerian patriots were killed, the French authorities committed new crimes in Oran, Algeria. There, four Algerian patriots were killed by the French authorities on the morning of the 30th.

    为人民而生　为祖国而死
    拉克利菲浩气长存
    就义前通过辩护律师给他家人写信深信阿尔及利亚必将获得独立自由
    新华社巴黎1日电　巴黎报纸刊载了7月30日在里昂被法国当局杀害的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线成员拉克利菲给他的家人的信。这封信是拉克利菲在就义前通过他的辩护律师转交的。
    他在信中说：“亲爱的父亲，我即将为祖国而死……我将像我的许多兄弟那样死去……我为自己的人民而生。我为我国的独立而斗争。在我临死的时候，我确信，我的国家将成为独立的和自由的。”
    拉克利菲的三个辩护律师发表声明，指责法国当局捏造罪名杀害拉克利菲等阿尔及利亚爱国者。
    声明揭露了拉克利菲以及同他一起受迫害的人在里昂监狱里所遭受的酷刑，声明说：
  “名叫马丁的一个医生证实，在四十五天以后，还可以在他们的身体上看出电刑的伤痕。”
    声明强调说，这几个阿尔及利亚爱国者都被剥夺了由他们所选择的辩护人进行辩护的权利。
    昨天传到巴黎的消息说，在杀害拉克利菲等阿尔及利亚爱国者的同一天，法国当局还在阿尔及利亚的奥兰犯下了新的罪行。那里有四个阿尔及利亚爱国者在30日早晨被法国当局杀害。
