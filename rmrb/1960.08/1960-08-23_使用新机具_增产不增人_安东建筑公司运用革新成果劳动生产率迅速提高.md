Using New Machines, Increased Production Without Increasing Manpower
Andong Construction Company Rapidly Increases Labor Productivity by Using Innovation Achievements

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Andong City Construction Company, in the "Four Modernizations" movement, has tightly grasped the innovation of machine manufacturing and rapidly applied the achievements of technical innovation and the technical revolution to production, achieving remarkable results. Now, they have comprehensively overfulfilled the state-assigned annual construction and installation tasks six months and two days ahead of schedule.

    In the first half of this year, relying on its own machinery factory, the company manufactured a total of 213 types of machinery, large and small, totaling 1,100 units (pieces). Using these machines, they achieved automation of 230 single machines, 53 automatic production lines, and 134 production linkage lines. Among these, the main ones are eight concrete mixing "dragons," eight woodworking "dragons," four steel bar "dragons," and twenty-three vertical and horizontal transportation "dragons." The total number of existing automatic and linkage lines has increased by 1.3 times compared to February. The appearance of these machines has significantly changed the face of the construction site. For example, in the past, concrete mixing required 30 people per shift from transportation to mixing, and the labor intensity was very high. After installing the concrete automatic line, only one or two people were left to patrol and inspect each shift, and everyone else was extracted; the most physically demanding work of digging trenches has been mechanized. Various machines adapted to different soil types are used to replace heavy manual labor. In general soil, self-made excavators are used for digging and winches are used for transportation. In soft soil, a "bottomless electric shovel" that can both dig and transport is used. Smaller trenches are dug with spiral excavators. Workers praised this situation, saying: In the past, carrying poles bent our backs, and sweat flowed; now, we operate with buttons, carefree and comfortable.

    As a result of the extensive use of innovative machinery, the company's labor productivity has rapidly increased, achieving both manpower reduction and increased production. According to statistics, the workload completed by the company in the first half of the year alone was one-third more than the workload completed in the entire previous year. According to the tasks for the first half of this year, they originally needed to increase the labor force by more than 3,000 people. Now, not only have they not increased manpower, but they have also extracted more than 1,000 people to establish four new construction sites and supplement the company's other self-run affiliated factories.

    The company's machinery factory was established entirely from scratch. When the factory started construction in 1958, it only had two old machine tools. Due to the company's Party committee's resolute implementation of the policy of self-reliance and vigorous development of diversified operations, fully mobilizing the masses, and vigorously carrying out the movement of "attacking three barriers" (technology, materials, equipment) and "four offerings" (offering ideas, offering materials, offering labor, offering technology), the factory has now developed into a machinery factory with 27 machine tools, more than 200 employees, and workshops for casting, riveting, electrical machinery, and processing. While vigorously developing the company's machinery factory, they have also established on-site repair workshops at the existing six construction sites. These workshops can manufacture many products and meet the needs of the construction sites. The Fifth Construction Site's repair workshop produced 16 electric motors and more than 40 tons of hardware components in the first half of this year, and also manufactured a tower crane weighing 50 tons, 29 meters high, and capable of lifting 5 tons.

They are determined to design and manufacture a horizontal milling machine based on the automatic vertical milling machine tool collectively designed and manufactured by them to solve the key to the production of automatic tipper cylinders, so that output can be greatly increased.

    使用新机具　增产不增人
    安东建筑公司运用革新成果劳动生产率迅速提高
    本报讯　安东市建筑公司在“四化”运动中，紧紧抓革新机具制造，迅速把技术革新和技术革命的成果用于生产，已取得显著成绩。现在，他们已经提前六个月零两天全面超额完成了国家下达的全年建筑安装任务。
    今年上半年，这个公司依靠自己的机械厂共制造了大小机械二百一十三种、一千一百台（件），用这些机具，实现了二百三十台单机自动化、五十三条自动生产线和一百三十四条生产联动线，其中主要的有混凝土搅拌“龙”八条，木工“龙”八条，钢筋“龙”四条，垂直水平运输“龙”二十三条，使现有自动线和联动线的总数比2月份增加了一点三倍。这些机具的出现，使工地的面貌发生了显著的变化。例如，搅拌混凝土过去从运输到搅拌每班要三十个人工作，劳动强度都很大，安装混凝土自动线后，每班只留了一、二个人巡回检查，其他人全都抽出去了；消耗体力最大的挖地槽工作已经实现了机械化，用适应不同土质的各种机具代替了笨重的手工操作，一般土质用自制的挖土机挖掘和用卷扬机运输，松软的土质用既能挖又能运的“电动无底锨”，较小的地槽就采用螺旋式挖土机。工人们称赞这种情况说：过去扁担压弯腰，汗水滔滔；如今操作用电钮，自在逍遥。
    大量采用革新机具的结果，全公司的劳动生产率迅速提高，做到了减人又增产。据统计，全公司只是上半年完成的工作量，就比去年全年完成的工作量还多了三分之一。按照今年上半年的任务，他们本来需要增加劳动力三千多人，现在不但没有增人，反而还抽出一千多人，成立了四个新的工地和充实了公司自办的其他附属工厂。
    这个公司的机械厂，全部是平地起家建立起来的。1958年开始建厂时，只有两台旧机床，由于公司党委坚决贯彻自力更生、大搞多种经营的方针，充分发动群众，大力开展了“攻三关”（技术、材料、设备）和“四献”（献计、献料、献工、献技术）的运动，现在，这个厂已发展成为一个有二十七台机床、二百多名职工、设有铸、铆、电机、加工等车间的机械厂了。在大力发展公司机械厂的同时，他们还在现有的六个工地上，建立了工地机修车间。这些车间，能够制造很多产品，满足工地的需要。五工地的机修车间今年上半年就生产了十六台电动机和四十多吨五金构件，还制造了一台重五十吨、高二十九米、能起重五吨的塔式起重机。（附图片）
    全国著名劳动模范、哈尔滨车辆厂机械车间工程师苏广铭和工人一起，积极响应党的开展增产节约运动的号召，决心在他们集体设计制造自动立铣机床的基础上，再设计制造一台卧式铣床，来解决生产自动翻车汽缸的关键，使产量大大增加。这是苏广铭（左二）和工人们正在研究设计卧式铣床。　新华社记者　宋挥摄
