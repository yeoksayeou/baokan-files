    Hubei Takes Measures to Combat Drought and Protect Seedlings
    For over a month, Hubei Province has not had significant rainfall. Some counties are experiencing varying degrees of drought. Currently, drought-affected areas are developing plans to combat the drought and protect seedlings, based on local conditions. The Huanggang Special District has already irrigated drought-affected crops once. In the Wuhan area, in addition to fully utilizing existing ponds and dikes for drought resistance, measures such as opening sluice gates, repairing canals, and building dams on rivers have been taken to divert water from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, irrigating most of the drought-affected rice paddies.
    To ensure the supply of irrigation equipment and technical expertise needed for the drought resistance efforts, cities are launching a high tide of support for drought relief.

    Guangxi Plants Various Coarse Grains According to Local Conditions
    Guangxi is striving to expand the planting of autumn coarse grain crops as much as possible. As of August 17, the entire autonomous region had planted approximately nine million mu of various coarse grain crops, of which over 3.65 million mu are high-yielding sweet potatoes.
    In expanding autumn planting, various localities are adopting diverse methods suited to local conditions, such as intercropping and crop rotation. For example, in Du'an Yao Autonomous County, the original dry land area and newly reclaimed land totaled over 900,000 mu. By employing intercropping and crop rotation, over 1.5 million mu of dry land crops such as sweet potatoes and late corn were planted. Many places are also fully utilizing vacant land for expansion, ensuring that no land is left idle. Huangcun and Meijiang Communes in Mengshan County conducted a thorough survey of abandoned land, identifying over 3,800 mu of barren fields and land, which were immediately planted with late autumn crops such as sweet potatoes.
    Localities are not only planting more but also managing the crops well.

    Yunnan Seizes the Opportunity to Plant Late Autumn Crops
    As of now, various areas in Yunnan have planted over eight million mu of various late autumn crops. The period before the end of the summer heat is an excellent time for Yunnan to sow late autumn crops. Recently, over one million people across the province were mobilized to rush-plant late autumn crops. Various localities are also universally implementing the "three major late autumn crops" – grain, fodder, and autumn vegetables – assigning fixed land for planting, special cultivation, and designated use. In the variety selection for grain crops, high-yield varieties are chosen according to local conditions, striving for high yields and abundant harvests in late autumn.

    Sichuan Strengthens Autumn Field Management
    Rural areas in Sichuan Province are focusing on grain production as the key and are vigorously managing autumn crop fields.
    Various areas in Sichuan regard maximizing labor power as a crucial measure to achieve increased autumn grain production. Led by the First Secretaries, various measures are being taken to vigorously tap labor potential. According to statistics from the Neijiang, Nanchong, Mianyang, and Wanxian Special Districts alone, over 1.7 million laborers have recently been transferred from county and commune industries, diversified operations, and logistics to strengthen the agricultural front line, effectively promoting current production.
    While focusing on autumn field management, various localities are also fully utilizing favorable natural conditions such as high temperatures and long frost-free periods to plant late autumn grain crops on a large scale, without affecting the production of next year's spring crops.

    Hunan Begins Harvesting Mid-Season Rice
    Some areas in Hunan Province have begun to rush-harvest mid-season rice. In the earlier-maturing Hengyang, Xiangtan, and Changde Special Districts, mid-season rice has gradually ripened and is entering a widespread harvesting phase. The labor force participating in the rush-planting (autumn miscellaneous grains) and rush-harvesting (mid-season rice) in the Hengyang Special District has increased to hundreds of thousands of people. Of the 2.9 million mu of mid-season rice in the entire special district, 300,000 mu had been harvested by August 19. During the rush harvest, all localities are particularly emphasizing careful harvesting to minimize losses.

    Utilizing Summer Floods for Afforestation and Desert Control
    The Tuanjie People's Commune in Shache County, Xinjiang, is using summer floods to plant trees, preventing the harm of shifting sand to farmland, houses, and roads.
    During the summer flood season, the commune used the floodwaters to sow seeds of sand dates, red willows, etc., along the edge of the desert in the areas most severely affected by wind and sand, creating a protective forest belt. To protect this protective forest belt, over 9,100 meters of sand barriers were set up using reeds and clay in areas with severe shifting sand. In addition, sand was sealed off along the edges of sand dunes to cultivate grass. Thanks to a series of desert control efforts, crops are currently growing well along the sand dune areas.

    要闻快报
    湖北部分地区抗旱保苗
    最近一个多月来湖北全省未下透雨。部分县份受到不同程度的干旱。目前，各受旱地区根据本地特点，分别制定了抗旱保苗规划。黄冈专区已给受旱作物普遍灌了一次水。武汉地区除了充分发挥现有塘堰的抗旱作用外，还采取了开闸修渠，拦河筑坝的措施，引进了江、河、湖、库的水，使大部分受旱的水稻得到灌溉。
    为了保证抗旱前线所需的灌溉设备、技术力量等，城市各行各业掀起了支援抗旱的高潮。
    广西因地制宜多种杂粮
    广西各地本着多多益善的精神，千方百计地扩种秋季杂粮作物。到八月十七日统计，全自治区已种下各种杂粮作物约九百万亩，其中高产的红茹占三百六十五万多亩。
    在扩大秋种中，各地都因地制宜，采取各种办法，间作套种。如都安瑶族自治县，原有旱地面积和新开荒地共九十多万亩，由于采用间作、套种等办法，共种上红茹、晚玉米等旱地作物一百五十多万亩。许多地方还充分利用空闲地扩种，做到寸土不闲。蒙山县黄村和湄江两个公社全面查荒灭荒，共查出三千八百多亩荒田荒地，立即种上红茹等晚秋作物。
    各地不仅多种，还做到了管好。
    云南抓紧时机种晚秋
    云南各地到目前为止，已种下各种晚秋作物八百多万亩。处暑以前是云南播种晚秋作物的良好时机。最近全省出动了百余万人抢种晚秋作物。各地还普遍把粮食、饲料和秋菜三大晚秋作物分别落实，固定土地种植，专地专种专管专用。在粮食作物的品种安排上，都因地制宜选种高产品种，力争晚秋高产多收。
    四川加强秋田管理
    四川省各地农村以粮为纲，大抓秋季作物田间管理。
    四川各地都把大抓劳动力作为争取秋季粮食增产的关键措施，由第一书记挂帅，采取各种措施大力挖掘劳动潜力。仅据内江、南充、绵阳、万县等四个专区统计，最近从县、社工业、多种经营、后勤等方面即调出一百七十多万劳动力，加强农业第一线，有力地促进了当前生产。
    在狠抓秋田管理的同时，各地还充分利用本地气温高、无霜期长等有利自然条件，在不影响明年小春作物生产的原则下，大种晚秋粮食作物。
    湖南开始收割中稻
    湖南省部分地区开始抢收中稻。季节较早的衡阳、湘潭、常德等专区的中稻已相继黄熟，进入普遍收割阶段。衡阳专区参加抢种（秋杂粮）抢收（中稻）的劳动力已增加到数十万人。全专区二百九十万亩中稻，到八月十九日止，已收割了三十万亩。在抢收中，各地都特别强调细打细收。
    利用夏洪造林治沙
    新疆莎车县团结人民公社利用夏季洪水植树造林，防止了流沙危害农田、房舍、道路。
    这个公社在夏季洪水期间，利用洪水在受风沙危害最严重的地区，沿沙漠边上播种了沙枣、红柳等，营造了一道防护林带。为了保护这一道防护林带，在流沙活动严重的地区，用芦苇、粘土设置了沙障九千一百多米。另外，还在沙丘边沿封沙育草。由于搞了一系列的治沙工作，目前沿沙丘地带作物生长良好。
