    《Hongyan》: A Carrier of Letters for the People Wang Yunman
    On the screen, a young, robust, and vibrant young man – rural postman Li Yunfei – walks towards us. He is not old, but he has been doing this job for eight years. In those eight years, regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter, or wind, frost, rain, or snow, his feet have never stopped. He has traveled 298,000 miles in the mountains, which is equivalent to circling the Earth three and a half times, and now he is on his fourth lap... The film "Hongyan" (Wild Goose) describes Li Yunfei's many moving advanced deeds, praising Li Yunfei's brilliant and splendid ideological qualities, like a poem full of youthful vitality and enthusiasm.
    "Every walk of life produces heroes," which is precisely the characteristic of our era. Even in some seemingly ordinary and inconspicuous positions, many advanced figures shine like brilliant stars. Not long ago, we made friends with Ma Tianmin, the model police officer in the film "Today is My Day Off"; now, Li Yunfei has entered our lives and attracted our hearts. Our film artists, while creating many heroes in battle and many advanced individuals in major construction projects, have also written and performed well the extraordinary heroes and advanced individuals in our ordinary positions.
    The portrayal of Li Yunfei in the film is successful. The film uses a tortuous and moving plot to realistically and vividly depict his infinite loyalty to the cause of the Party and to revolutionary work. We see that, like a red thread running through the entire film, is the scene of how Li Yunfei, unafraid of all hardships and difficulties, tries to open up a postal route to Changbai Mountain; and how Li Yunfei tries every means to eliminate two "dead letters," and finally finds the revolutionary veteran, old traffic officer Jin Yin Song, from the clues in the letter. This artistic treatment of the film has a clear purpose. Although Jin Yin Song is arranged to meet Li Yunfei at the end of the film, the lofty and great revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary前辈, and the style of hard work to realize the great ideal, has long been deeply imprinted in Li Yunfei's heart. Jin Yin Song is a representative figure. Countless selfless revolutionaries like him have emerged from the fiery years of the people's revolutionary war, going in and out of gunfire, risking life and death, shouldering the sacred responsibility of revolutionary traffic officers, and making contributions to the Party and the people. It is precisely because of the Party's earnest teachings, and precisely from revolutionary predecessors like Jin Yin Song, that Li Yunfei has gained a model for learning and a driving force for work. He loves his work, cherishes his work, and further understands the great significance of the work entrusted to him by the people, and the responsibilities he shoulders. The film's description repeatedly emphasizes and renders the postal bag that Jin Yin Song gave to the post office branch director, Lao Zheng (with the words "People's Transportation" embroidered on it), and repeatedly describes and depicts Jin Yin Song's selfless demeanor for revolutionary work through people's memories, precisely to highlight the revolutionary significance of Li Yunfei being a people's correspondent in the era of socialist construction. When Li Yunfei follows the Party's instructions, shoulders the people's expectations, braves the wind and snow, braves the danger, and steps on the high mountains where there has been no postal route since ancient times, he is full of fighting spirit and full of fearless spirit. Twenty years ago, Jin Yin Song, the traffic officer of the Anti-Japanese United Army and revolutionary correspondent, said to Lao Zheng in the hard days of the national liberation war: "These two legs of mine have never been stingy to my own people and to the revolution." Today, twenty years later, Li Yunfei, a socialist traffic officer, asks Lao Zheng to allow him to catch up with Changbai Mountain before the New Year. He said: "How many people are waiting for our rural postmen on and off Changbai Mountain! If we send the Party's call and relatives' letters to them in the New Year, and see that their work has been promoted, see that a soaring revolutionary spirit has been generated, and see their smiling faces, then I think seeing them for even a second is better than spending five years!" Yes! The pursuit of communist ideals, the victory of the revolution, and the leap forward in socialist construction, "this is our happiness." It generates great power, inspires revolutionary predecessors, and also encourages the younger generation to devote all their strength.
    The film's description of Li Yunfei's climbing the mountain and the scene of his meeting with Jin Yin Song are particularly moving and meaningful. From here, the soul of Li Yunfei, an advanced revolutionary youth, and the most glorious page of his beautiful youth are revealed.
    The film also vividly shows that Li Yunfei has a grand and magnificent revolutionary ideal and inherits the spirit of hard work of the revolutionary predecessors. His mass viewpoint is particularly strong. Li Yunfei not only does every job conscientiously and diligently, without wasting a second, and is praised by the masses as a "living clock." Similarly, as long as it is something that is beneficial to the masses, as long as it is needed for revolutionary work, he regards it as his "natural duty." He has great ambitions and a broad vision, so he sees the social significance and revolutionary role of his work from many ordinary and small daily tasks and interactions with others. In Li Yunfei's body, the film summarizes the common characteristics of our thousands of ordinary workers. It can be said that the screenwriters, directors, and actors of "Hongyan" are striving to use the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism to shape communist style figures like Li Yunfei.

    为人民传书的《鸿雁》王云缦
    在银幕上，一个年轻的、结实的、朝气勃勃的小伙子——乡邮员李云飞迎面向我们走来。他年纪不大，可是干这个工作已经有八年了。八年中，不管是春夏秋冬，还是风霜雨雪，他的双脚从来没有停过。他在山里走了二十九万八千里，等于绕地球走了三圈半，现在他正在走第四圈……。影片《鸿雁》像一首充满青春活力和热情洋溢的诗篇那样，描述了李云飞的许多动人的先进事迹，颂扬了李云飞的光辉灿烂的思想品质。
    “行行出英雄”，这正是我们时代的特征。即使是在一些看来比较平常、不易为人注目的岗位上，许多先进人物也如灿烂的星群那样闪耀着光芒。不久前，我们才和影片《今天我休息》中的模范民警马天民交上了朋友；如今，李云飞又进入我们的生活里来，吸引了我们的心。我们的电影艺术家们在创造了许多战斗中的英雄、许多重大建设中的先进分子的同时，也写好、演好了我们平凡岗位上的不平凡的英雄人物、先进人物。
    影片中李云飞这一形象的塑造是成功的。影片以曲折动人的故事情节，真实而生动地刻划了他对党的事业、对革命工作的无限忠诚。我们看到，如同一根红线似地贯串着整个影片的，是李云飞如何不怕一切艰苦、困难，设法开辟去长白山的邮路的情景；是李云飞如何千方百计消灭两封“死信”，终于从信的线索找到了革命前辈、老交通员金银松的情景。影片这样的艺术处理，正是有着鲜明的目的性的。金银松虽然被安排在影片结尾时才和李云飞相见，但是，革命前辈崇高而伟大的革命精神，为实现伟大理想艰苦奋斗的作风，早已深深地印在李云飞的心底了。金银松是一个代表人物，无数像他那样忘我的革命者，正是在人民革命战争的烽火岁月里，出入枪林弹雨，冒着生死危险，担负起了革命交通员的神圣职责，为党、为人民立下了功勋。正是有了党的谆谆教导，正是从金银松这样的革命前辈身上，李云飞获得了学习的榜样和工作的动力。他从热爱自己的工作，珍视自己的工作，进而更理解了人民交给自己的这一份工作的伟大意义，和自己肩负的责任。影片的描写所以反复强调和渲染金银松当年送给邮政局支局长老郑的那个邮袋（上面绣有“人民交通”的字样），以及通过人们的回忆，一再描写与刻划金银松为革命工作忘我的风貌，正是为了烘托李云飞在社会主义建设时代当一名人民通讯员的革命意义。当李云飞遵循着党的指示，肩负着人民的期望，冒着风雪，冒着危险，跨上自古以来没有邮路的高山时，他是斗志昂扬，充满了大无畏的精神。二十年前，抗联的交通、革命的通讯员金银松在民族解放战争的艰苦日子里，曾对老郑说：“我这两条腿，对待自己人，对待革命从来是不吝啬的。”二十年后的今天，社会主义的小交通李云飞要求老郑允许他在年前赶上长白山。他说：“长白山山上、山下有多少人等着咱们乡邮员哪！要是在新年把党的号召、亲人的信件送到他们手里，看见推动了他们的工作，看见产生了冲天的革命干劲，看见他们的笑脸，那时候，我看他们，哪怕是一秒钟也胜过过五个年！”是呵！对共产主义理想的追求，革命的胜利，社会主义建设的飞跃前进，“这就是我们的幸福”。它产生巨大的力量，鼓舞革命的前辈，也策励年轻的一代，付出自己的全部力量。
    影片中关于李云飞登山的描写和他同金银松相见的场面，特别动人，意味深长。从这里，揭示了李云飞这一先进革命青年的灵魂，揭示了他美好青春中最光辉的一页。
    影片也比较生动地表现了李云飞有远大宏伟的革命理想、继承了革命前辈的艰苦奋斗的工作精神。他的群众观点特别强。李云飞不仅兢兢业业、勤勤恳恳地做好每一件本份工作，不误分秒时间，被群众誉为“活钟表”。同样，只要是对群众有益的事，只要是革命工作需要的事，他都视为自己的“天职”。他心怀大志，眼界开阔，所以他从许许多多平凡、细小的日常工作中，待人处世中，看到了自己工作的社会意义和革命作用。在李云飞的身上，影片概括了我们千万普通劳动者的共同特征。可以说，《鸿雁》的编、导、演是在努力运用革命的现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的创作方法来塑造李云飞等具有共产主义风格的人物形象。（附图片）
