    Three Name Changes	Zhang Ming
    The big-character poster on the wall gleams red,
    Inscribed with: "She is the commune's female vanguard."
    I couldn't help but blush with excitement when I saw it,
    Turns out the commune members are praising me!
    Female vanguard, female vanguard,
    This name is extraordinary!
    Thinking of my three name changes,
    A song of happiness sings in my heart!
    Since childhood, I was a child bride, suffering,
    As an adult, I always kept my head down, silent,
    My parents-in-law scolded me for lacking common sense,
    The name "Silly Wife" spread throughout the village.
    The spring thunder of liberation roared,
    Bitter seedlings saw the sun,
    I walked out of my mother-in-law's house,
    My hands became skillful, and my mind bright.
    In one night, I learned to keep work records,
    In three months, I became literate and could read articles,
    The fattened pigs I raised were big and large,
    The embroidered flowers had a fragrant scent,
    The commune members said I wasn't silly at all,
    They changed my name to "Clever Girl"!
    The Three Red Banners shine with golden light for ten thousand miles,
    I transformed into a colorful phoenix, spreading my wings and soaring,
    I took off my apron to build reservoirs,
    I cut my braids to make steel,
    I set aside the small pot to run the canteen,
    I put down the spinning wheel to repair the factory,
    I dare to go on the high-yield competition stage,
    I also want to storm the scientific fortress,
    No matter how many difficulties I fear,
    I will open a road to paradise!
    Silly Wife, Clever Girl,
    Now I have become a female vanguard!
    Three name changes, lasting happiness,
    The source of happiness is the Party!
    Holding high the red flag, riding the wind and waves, heading forward,
    Forever be a Communist female vanguard! (With picture) [Zhao Zhifang Illustration]

    三改名	章明
    墙头上大字报闪着红光，
    上写着：“她是公社的女闯将”。
    我一看不由得脸红心跳，
    原来是社员们把我表扬！
    女闯将，女闯将，
    这个名字不平常！
    想起我三次名儿改，
    幸福的歌儿在心里唱！
    自小是童养媳受了恓惶，
    成年价低着头不声不响，
    公婆骂我生来缺个心眼，
    “傻媳妇”的名字传遍村庄。
    解放的春雷响，
    苦苗苗见太阳，
    走出婆婆家，
    手巧心也亮。
    一夜晚学会记工账，
    三个月脱盲读文章，
    喂的肥猪大又大，
    绣出鲜花花有香，
    社员们说我并不傻，
    改了个名字叫“巧姑娘”！
    三面红旗万里闪金光，
    我身变彩凤展翅飞翔，
    脱下围裙修水库，
    剪了辫子去炼钢，
    撇开小锅办食堂，
    撂下纺车修工厂，
    丰产擂台也敢上，
    科学堡垒也要闯，
    千难万难我不怕，
    要开大路通天堂！
    傻媳妇，巧姑娘，
    如今又成了女闯将！
    三改名，幸福长，
    幸福的源泉就是党！
    高举红旗乘风破浪奔前方，
    永远做共产主义的女闯将！（附图片）〔赵志方　插图〕
