Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The Chinese delegation attending the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has continued to have extensive contact with various circles in Japan in the past two days.

　　Head of the delegation, Liu Ningyi, met with Kazami Akira, chairman of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, Endo Saburo, head of the former military personnel delegation to China, and leaders of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and held cordial talks on strengthening the friendly relations between the two peoples. These talks were filled with sincere friendship.

　　Deputy head of the delegation, Zhao Puchu, held talks with Takanashi Ryusen, chairman of the All-Japan Buddhist Association, as well as prominent figures in Japanese Buddhist circles such as Shiio Benkyo, Nishikawa Keibun, and Okochi Takahiro. They exchanged views on the issues of defending peace and promoting friendship in religious circles.

　　Deputy head of the delegation, Zhao Anbo, held talks with Tetsu Katayama, advisor to the Democratic Socialist Party, Murayama Satarou, a figure in the fishing industry, and Yamamoto Kumaichi and Suketani Eiichi from the trade circles. Murayama Satarou expressed his gratitude for China's assistance to Japanese fishing boats in sheltering from storms in Chinese ports.

　　Japanese women's circles held cordial talks with Huang Ganying, a member of the Chinese delegation. Kushida Fuki, chairman of the Japan Women's Association Federation, and Kubushiro Koto, chairman of the Japan-China Women's Exchange Association, visited Huang Ganying. They enthusiastically stated that they would work hard to realize the invitation of a Chinese women's delegation to visit Japan next year during the cherry blossom season.

　　Secretary-General of the delegation Chen Yu, Deputy Secretary-General Sun Pinghua, and other members of the delegation also had extensive contact with Japanese trade unions, the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, political circles, and the press.

　　So far, the Chinese delegation has only contacted a small portion of the people from various circles in Japan who have requested to meet with the delegation. In addition, there are hundreds of groups and individuals in Tokyo who are requesting meetings with the Chinese delegation; many people's organizations in various prefectures of Japan have also invited the Chinese delegation to visit various places. However, because the Japanese government only approved a two-week visit for the Chinese delegation and refused the request of various Japanese people's organizations to extend the duration of the Chinese delegation's visit, the friendly wishes of friends from all walks of life in Japan are difficult to realize.

    中国代表团同日本各界广泛接触
    日本很多团体和个人继续要求会见中国代表团
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：出席第六届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的中国代表团这两天继续同日本各界广泛接触。
    刘宁一团长会见了恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章、前军人访华代表团团长远藤三郎和日本工会总评议会的领导人，就加强两国人民的友好关系进行了亲切的交谈。这些交谈充满了诚挚的友谊。
    赵朴初副团长和全日本佛教会会长高阶珑仙以及日本佛教界著名人士椎尾办匡、西川景文、大河内隆弘等进行了会谈，他们就宗教界保卫和平和促进友好的问题交换了意见。
    赵安博副团长和民主社会党顾问片山哲、渔业界人士村山佐太郎以及贸易界的山本熊一、宿谷荣一等各方面人士进行了交谈。村山佐太郎对中国援护日本渔船在中国港口避风避难表示感谢。
    日本妇女界人士同中国代表团团员黄甘英进行了亲切的交谈。日本妇女团体联合会会长栉田蕗、日中妇女交流会会长久布白落实等人访问了黄甘英。她们热情地表示，要为明年樱花时节实现邀请中国妇女代表团访日而努力。
    代表团秘书长陈宇、副秘书长孙平化和其它团员也同日本工会、亚非团结委员会、政界、新闻界进行了广泛接触。
    到目前为止，中国代表团已经接触的还只是日本各界提出要同代表团会见的人当中的一小部分。此外，在东京，还有数以百计的团体和个人要求同中国代表团会见；日本各道、府、县的许多人民团体也纷纷邀请中国代表去各地访问。但是，由于日本政府只批准中国代表团在日本访问两星期，而拒绝日本各人民团体关于延长中国代表团访日期限的要求，因此日本各界朋友的友好愿望难以实现。
