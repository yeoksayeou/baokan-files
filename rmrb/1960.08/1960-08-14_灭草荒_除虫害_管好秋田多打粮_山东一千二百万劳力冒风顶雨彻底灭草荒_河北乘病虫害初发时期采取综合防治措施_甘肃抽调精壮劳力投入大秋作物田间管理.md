Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 12th: The people of Shandong are making every effort to fight against continuous rain, overcome weed infestation and insect pests, and step up topdressing and manure accumulation, determined to win an autumn harvest.

    The sowing of more than 60 million mu of late autumn crops in Shandong has been basically completed on time, and the sowing of autumn vegetables is being carried out in a concentrated manner. However, since late June, there has been continuous rain in various places, and weeds have grown luxuriantly. In many areas, people could not enter the fields, so weeds could not be hoed. After hoeing, they quickly revived due to the rain, and the weed-infested area had grown to more than 48 million mu. The area affected by various insect pests has also reached more than 10 million mu. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decisively took weeding and eradicating weeds as the central task overriding everything else, resolutely squeezing out all possible labor, animal power, and tools from all aspects to enrich field management, vigorously grasping agriculture, and vigorously grasping grain; requiring all localities to eliminate weed infestation with the tenacious will to eradicate weeds at their roots. Hundreds of thousands of cadres from the province, prefectures, counties, and communes, as well as the work teams dispatched to the countryside by various departments, have mostly achieved the goal of dividing areas for contracting, participating in weeding, and leading weeding. Many prefectural and county party secretaries have led work teams to the areas with the most serious weed infestation to specifically direct the battle. All agencies and schools in the Yantai area were mobilized, and all commune-run industries, except for factories manufacturing agricultural machinery, tools, and fertilizers, were shut down for seven days. Water conservancy projects were reduced, except for personnel engaged in emergency work, disaster relief, and flood control, to participate in weeding and pest control. Using these methods, the province has concentrated more than 12 million people and a large number of animal power and tools to engage in the battle of weeding, eradicating weeds, pest control and topdressing. People seized the weather, raced against time, and worked hard in the wind and rain. All plows, hoes, and drills were put into action, and people and animals were mobilized together. As of August 2nd, spring and summer crops throughout the province had basically been hoeed once, and more than 30 million mu had been hoeed two to three times. More than 42 million mu of weed infestation had been eliminated, accounting for more than 85% of the weed infestation area. More than 50% of various insect pests have been eliminated, and various fertilizers have been applied to more than 30 million mu.

    In order to completely eliminate weed infestation, a comprehensive inspection of field management centered on weeding and eradicating weeds has been widely carried out in various places. In Shouzhang County, weed infestation was serious in thirteen large depressions. The county party secretary took the lead, and communes formed a joint command to concentrate more than 67,000 people to launch a concentrated attack on weed eradication. In the key locust areas of Jining, Jinxiang, and Weishan counties, professional assault teams were also organized to encircle and suppress locusts, eliminating them all in one fell swoop. According to an inspection of six counties and cities including Gaotang and Dezhou in the Liaocheng area, 635 units were slow to act due to insufficient personnel, land, tools, animal power, and lack of specific leadership, and the area of weed infestation continued to expand; some production teams finished weeding the general fields, but there were still many weeds in remote areas, interplanted areas, and "ten-edge" fields. In response to these situations, various counties have sent additional leading cadres to these areas where weeding is relatively backward to help improve labor organization and organize large-scale cooperation between nearby communes and teams. Under the principle of equal value and mutual benefit, the advanced teams in the entire area have transferred a total of 80,000 laborers and more than 3,500 head of livestock to help backward units eliminate more than 250,000 mu of weed infestation, and the weed infestation in many "dead corner" areas has also been cleared.

    During this period, factories and enterprises in various parts of Shandong also launched a high tide of supporting field management and promoting increased grain production, focusing on the urgent needs of agricultural production such as weeding, pest control, and topdressing. Factories and enterprises in Jinan and Qingdao successively dispatched more than 4,000 cadres and technicians, carrying machinery and spare parts, to the countryside to help repair and manufacture intertillage weeding, pest control, and topdressing tools. According to incomplete statistics, more than 80,000 rubber-wheeled carts have been repaired, more than 50,000 weeding tools have been manufactured, and more than 20,000 technical personnel have been trained for the communes. Hundreds of thousands of commercial employees throughout the province have also rushed to transport the materials needed for field management. According to statistics for June and July, the province supplied more than 72,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, more than 37,000 sets (pieces) of machinery and tools, as well as a large number of pesticides and agricultural machinery.

    Now, after achieving initial victories in eradicating weeds, eliminating insects, and topdressing, various places have launched a "three-drive" movement centered on "careful hoeing and skillful topdressing" to "drive general fields to become high-yield fields, drive weak seedlings to become strong seedlings, and drive 'ten-edge' fields to become large fields," making field management more solid and meticulous.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 12th: While rushing to reclaim wasteland and plant vegetables, Hebei Province is seizing the critical period of the initial occurrence of diseases and insect pests to carry out concentrated prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. As of now, the major autumn crops with diseases and insect pests have been treated once, and some have been treated three to four times.

    In the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, party and government leaders at all levels personally took the lead, leading the pest control army into battle. Handan City, led by the deputy mayor, has formed a disease and insect pest prevention and control headquarters. Xingtai County has further inspected and rectified the county's pest control organizations, formed 1,004 pest control professional teams, and established disease and pest forecasting and reporting stations in seven communes, so that the county has basically achieved the goal of having professional teams in every team and intelligence stations in every commune. All localities have seized the critical stage of the initial occurrence of diseases and insect pests, adopted comprehensive prevention and control measures, implemented comprehensive attacks, and completely eliminated pests. The Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized more than 100,000 laborers to adopt comprehensive measures such as catching (moths), picking (eggs), irrigating (medicine), spraying (powder), and spreading (granules). After two days of concentrated attacks, all the crops infested with borers and bollworms have been treated once. In order to timely eliminate emerging locust nymphs, Xushui County, in the spirit of "early, skillful, ruthless, and meticulous," organized students and commune members to prevent and control more than 24,000 mu in three days. In order to promote the development of pest control work, various localities have widely promoted the methods of "three guarantees" (guaranteeing investigation, treatment, and elimination) and "six fixings" (fixing people, time, medicine, machinery, quality, and work points). During the movement, evaluations, inspections, and acceptances were also organized in a timely manner, which greatly promoted the development of the pest control movement.

    During the disease and insect pest prevention and control movement, various localities also carried out the reform of spraying equipment. Tianjin City successfully tested the method of using smoke agents to control borers, and the insecticidal effect was above 90%. Shijiazhuang City modified more than 30,000 sprayers, which greatly improved the efficiency of pest control.

    During the movement, all walks of life gave strong support. The handicraft industry departments in various counties promptly repaired machinery, so that all 400,000 sprayers and sprayers in the province were put into the battle of insect eradication. The commercial departments promptly distributed more than 100 million jin of pesticides prepared to the counties and communes, and the grassroots supply and marketing departments also promptly delivered the medicines to the fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 12th: Gansu Province has mobilized 620,000 strong laborers to carry out field management of major autumn crops, striving for a bumper harvest of autumn crops. As of the beginning of August, more than 16.3 million mu of major autumn crops in the province had been hoeed once, of which more than 8.8 million mu had been hoeed two to three times, 1.63 million mu had been watered, and 2.82 million mu had been fertilized.

    This year, after Gansu Province transferred 100,000 cadres from the province, prefectures, counties, and communes to strengthen the agricultural front line, the leadership was specific and effective, and the measures were solid and meticulous. In areas such as Longdong and Longnan, where the summer harvest has ended, about 70% of the labor force is currently invested in field management of major autumn crops. Areas where the summer harvest is entering a tense stage are also vigorously grasping autumn field management. After summarizing the experience of old farmers, the Pingliang area comprehensively promoted the practice of piling up high-stem crops after weeding, which promotes deep rooting of seedlings, makes them less prone to lodging, and preserves moisture and resists drought. Due to the creation, improvement, and promotion of advanced weeding tools, Gongjing People's Commune in Yuzhong County completed the weeding task of major autumn crops half a month earlier than last year. Various localities have also paid attention to applying different fertilizers according to the nature of the land and watering thin fertilizers to enhance the drought resistance of crops.

    Various localities have also promoted large-scale high-yield by grasping both ends and driving the middle. The method is to use high-yield fields to make up for deficiencies and ensure total output with high-yield, and to grasp the method of eliminating third-class fields, striving for a comprehensive harvest. Ning County has generally hoeed the major autumn crops three times, prevented and controlled diseases and insect pests once in the high-yield fields, applied high-quality manure once, and some land has also been irrigated with quick-acting thin manure. Tie Zhaobao team of Xiaojubu Commune hoeed the third-class fields of more than 3,000 mu of corn three times and applied fertilizer three times, upgrading all of them.

    Various localities have also carried out "four preventions" (preventing diseases and insect pests, preventing floods, preventing wind, and preventing hail) early, and many areas have established intelligence networks. In the mountainous forest areas of Longnan, corn has already tasseled and formed ears, and various localities have begun to organize hunting teams to prepare for autumn protection.

    灭草荒　除虫害　管好秋田多打粮
    山东一千二百万劳力冒风顶雨彻底灭草荒
    河北乘病虫害初发时期采取综合防治措施
    甘肃抽调精壮劳力投入大秋作物田间管理
    本报济南12日电　山东人民正千方百计向阴雨搏斗，战胜草荒、虫害，加紧追肥积肥，誓夺秋季丰收。
    山东六千多万亩晚秋作物已经基本适时种完，秋菜播种正在突击进行。但是，从6月下旬以来，各地持续阴雨，杂草丛生，许多地区田间进不去人，有草不能下锄，锄后遇雨又很快复活，草荒面积曾发展到四千八百多万亩。各种虫害发生面积也达到一千多万亩。中共山东省委当机立断，迅速把锄草灭荒作为压倒一切的中心任务，坚决从各方面挤出一切可能挤出的劳力、畜力、工具充实田间管理，大抓农业，大抓粮食；要求各地以斩草除根的顽强意志消灭草荒。会师到田的省、地、县、社的几十万名干部和各级各部门派驻农村的工作组，绝大部分做到分片包干、参加锄草、领导锄草。许多地区的地、县委书记都率领工作组到草荒最严重的地方具体指挥战斗。烟台专区机关、学校全部出动，社办工业除制造农机、农具、肥料的工厂以外，一律停工七天，水利工程除去抢工抢险防汛的人员外，其余一律削减下来参加锄草治虫。全省各地采用这些办法，一共集中了一千二百多万人和大批畜力、工具投入锄草灭荒和除虫追肥的战斗。人们抢天气、争分秒，顶风冒雨，小雨小干，无雨大干，犁、锄、耧全部上阵，人畜一齐出动。到8月2日为止，全省春夏作物基本上普锄一遍，有三千多万亩锄过二至三遍以上，草荒被消灭四千二百多万亩，占草荒发生面积85％以上。各种虫害被消灭50％以上，追施各种肥料三千多万亩。
    为了彻底消灭草荒，各地普遍开展了以锄草灭荒为中心的田间管理大检查。寿张县有十三个大洼草荒严重，县委书记挂帅，社与社组成联合指挥所，集中六万七千多人突击灭荒。济宁、金乡、微山等三县重点蝗虫区，也组织专业突击队围攻包剿蝗虫，一网打尽。据聊城专区高唐、德州等六个县市检查，有六百三十五个单位由于人少地多、工具畜力不足和领导抓得不具体而行动迟缓，草荒面积继续扩大；有些生产队把一般田的草锄完了，但还有很多边远地、插花地、“十边”地草苗不分。针对这些情况，各县在这些锄草比较后进的地方增派领导骨干，帮助搞好劳动组合，并且组织附近社队大协作。在等价互利的原则下，全专区先进队共抽调八万名劳力，三千五百多头牲畜，帮助落后单位灭荒二十五万多亩，许多“死角”地的草荒也被清除干净。
    山东各地工厂企业在这个期间，也围绕锄草、治虫、追肥等农业生产当务之急，掀起支援田间管理、大促粮食增产的高潮。济南、青岛地区工厂企业先后派出四千多干部和技术工人，带着机械、配件下乡，帮助修配和制造中耕锄草、治虫、追肥工具。据不完全统计，已修好胶轮车八万多辆，赶制锄草工具五万多件，为公社培训技术人员两万多名。全省数十万名商业职工也赶运田间管理所需的物资。据6、7月份统计，全省供应化肥七万二千多吨，机、具三万七千多台
  （件），以及大批农药农械等。
    现在各地在取得灭荒、除虫、追肥初步胜利之后，又掀起了以“细锄巧追”为中心的“一般田赶丰产田、弱苗赶壮苗、‘十边’赶大田”的三赶运动，使田间管理更踏实更细致。
    新华社天津12日电　河北省在突击抢荒种菜的同时，抓紧病虫发生初期的关键时期，突击防治病虫害。截至目前，已将发生病虫害的大秋作物，普遍除治了一遍，部分除治了三至四遍。
    在防治病虫害中，各级党政领导干部亲自上阵，带领除虫大军投入战斗。邯郸市由副市长任指挥，已组成防治病虫指挥部。邢台县进一步检查整顿了全县的除虫组织，组成了一千零四个除虫专业队，并在七个公社健全了虫情预测预报点，使全县基本达到了方方队队有专业队，社社有情报点。各地抓紧病虫初生的关键，采取了综合防治措施，实行全面突击，彻底歼灭虫害。中共石家庄市委动员十余万名劳力，采用捕（蛾）、采（卵）、灌（药）、喷（粉）、撒（颗粒剂）等综合措施，经两天突击，已将发生钻心虫和棉铃虫的庄稼，全部治了一遍。徐水县为及时消灭出土蝗蝻，本着“早、巧、狠、细”的精神，组织学生和社员，在三天内，防治了二万四千多亩。为了促进除虫工作的开展，各地普遍推广了  “三包”（包查、包治、包消灭）“六定”（定人、定时、定药、定械、定质量、定工分）的办法。运动中还及时组织了评比、检查、验收，大大地促进了除虫运动的开展。
    在防治病虫害运动中，各地还进行了喷药器械的改革。天津市试验成功烟雾剂防治钻心虫的办法，杀虫效果在90％以上。石家庄市改装了喷雾器三万多件，大大提高了除虫效率。
    在运动中，各行各业都给予大力支援。各县手工业部门及时检修器械，使全省四十万架喷粉器和喷雾器全部投入灭虫战斗。商业部门及时将备妥的一亿多斤农药下放到县、社，基层供销部门还及时把药送到田间。
    新华社兰州12日电　甘肃省出动六十二万精壮劳力进行大秋作物田间管理工作，力争秋季作物大丰收。截至8月初，全省一千六百三十余万亩大秋作物已经锄过一遍草，其中八百八十余万亩分别锄草两遍到三遍，一百六十三万亩浇灌了水，二百八十二万亩施了肥。
    今年甘肃省从省、专、县、社四级抽调十万名干部加强农业第一线后，做到领导具体得力，措施扎实细致。陇东、陇南等已经结束夏收的地区，目前以70％左右的劳力投入大秋作物田间管理，夏收正进入紧张阶段的地区，也大抓秋田管理。平凉地区总结老农经验后，全面推广了高秆作物锄草后壅平堆，促使禾苗扎根深，不易倒伏，而且保墒耐旱。榆中县贡井人民公社由于创制、改进和推广锄草先进工具，比去年提前半月完成了大秋作物锄草任务。各地还注意按土地性质施不同肥料，浇灌稀肥等，增强作物抗旱能力。
    各地还以抓两头，带中间的办法，促进大面积高额丰产。办法是抓丰产田以丰补欠，以高额丰产保总产，抓消灭三类田的办法，力争全面丰收。宁县已给大秋作物普遍锄了三遍草，高额丰产田防治了一次病虫害，又施了一次优质粪，一部分地还浇灌了速效稀粪。肖咀公社铁赵堡中队给三千多亩玉米三类田锄了三遍草，连施三次肥后，使其全部升级。
    各地还及早开展了“四防”（防病虫、防洪、防风、防雹）工作，不少地区建立了情报网。陇南山林地区玉米已经出缨结实，各地已开始组织打猎小组准备护秋。
