    Jilin Carries Out Major Inspection of Autumn Vegetable Production
    (Our newspaper, Changchun, August 27th) On the basis of overfulfilling the autumn vegetable sowing plan, all parts of Jilin Province are now conducting a comprehensive inspection of autumn vegetable production and have universally launched a high tide of field management of autumn vegetables.
    In order to manage this year's autumn vegetables well, in light of the characteristics of this year's large autumn vegetable area, many newly reclaimed lands and wheat stubble lands, and many rainy days, various localities are required to achieve three earlies (early thinning, early setting seedlings, and early prevention of pests and diseases) and two timelies (timely weeding and hoeing, timely topdressing).
    Therefore, the whole province launched a major inspection of autumn vegetable production in mid-August. The inspection covers seven items: sown area, field management, production organization, market supply, material preparation, tool reform, and organizational leadership. Through in-depth inspection, the field management of autumn vegetables has been pushed to a climax. The early-sown autumn vegetables in the province have basically completed the first weeding and hoeing and thinning work. In the suburbs of Changchun City, the second weeding and hoeing has reached 35% of the autumn vegetable area, and more than 1,000 hectares have been topdressed. In the suburbs of Jilin City, more than 4,000 hectares of autumn vegetables have been hoed, 1,700 hectares have been thinned, and a total of more than 2,500 hectares have been topdressed and sprayed with pesticides. In some waterlogged areas, ditches are being actively dug for drainage, and seedlings are being transplanted and replanted.
    This year, all localities have strongly emphasized meticulous management of autumn vegetables in order to strive for high yields and abundant harvests. In order to manage autumn vegetables well, Shuangyang County has universally implemented fixed leadership, organized specialized groups, and implemented fixed tasks, fixed output, and fixed remuneration. A total of more than 1,000 specialized groups with more than 8,000 people have been established in the county, and they are currently weeding and hoeing for the second time. Chengxi Commune in the suburbs of Changchun City has adopted the method of "supplementing, thinning, weeding, hoeing, preventing, and topdressing 'one-stop' operation," which has improved the management level of autumn vegetables. According to the experience that autumn vegetables are prone to insect pests after emerging from the soil, the Chengxi Management Area of this commune has selected a group of old farmers from each production team to conduct daily consultations and nightly patrols. When pests are found, they are captured and exterminated on the spot to ensure that the autumn vegetables are not harmed by insects.

    吉林开展秋菜生产大检查
    本报长春27日电　吉林省各地在超额完成秋菜播种计划的基础上，正全面进行秋菜生产大检查，并普遍掀起秋菜田间管理高潮。
    为了管理好今年的秋菜，各地针对今年秋菜面积大，新开地、麦茬地多，阴雨天多等特点，要求做到三早（早间苗、早定苗、早预防病虫害）、二及时（及时铲趟、及时追肥）。
    因此，全省于8月中旬展开秋菜生产大检查。检查播种面积、田间管理、生产组织、市场供应、物资准备、工具改革、组织领导等七项。通过深入检查，已把秋菜田间管理推向高潮。全省早播秋菜已基本结束头遍铲趟和间苗工作。长春市郊二遍铲趟已达秋菜面积35％，并有一千多公顷追了肥。吉林市郊区已铲出秋菜四千多公顷，间苗一千七百公顷，追肥和打药共二千五百多公顷。部分受涝地区，正积极挖沟排水和移苗、补种。
    今年各地十分强调细致管理秋菜，争取高产多收。双阳县为了管理好秋菜，普遍实行了固定领导、组织专业小组，并实行定任务、定产量、定报酬。全县共建立一千多个专业组八千多人，目前正铲趟二遍。长春市郊城西公社采取“补、间、铲、趟、防、追‘一条龙’作业”方法，提高了秋菜管理水平。这个公社的城西管理区根据秋菜出土后容易遭受虫害的经验，各生产队都抽调一批老农，天天会诊、夜夜巡逻，发现害虫，就地捕灭，保证了秋菜不受虫害。
