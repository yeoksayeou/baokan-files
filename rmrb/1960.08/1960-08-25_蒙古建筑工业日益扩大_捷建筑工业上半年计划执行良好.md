Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, August 22nd: With the rapid development of industry and agriculture and animal husbandry, the construction industry of the Mongolian People's Republic is expanding. In 1960, the state's investment in the construction industry reached 260 million tugriks, an increase of 36.8% compared with 1957. The area of various projects put into use in 1959 was 200,000 square meters, which is 2.23 times that of 1958.

    Mongolia has established a brick and tile factory with an annual output of 25 million bricks, four reinforced concrete component factories, and some small and medium-sized brick and tile factories, lime factories, and timber processing factories. At present, there are more than 30,000 construction technicians and workers at all levels in the country. Construction bases have also been established in the countryside.

    Mongolia's construction industry developed after the victory of the revolution. Before the revolution, Mongolia did not have a single house built by itself, nor did it have a construction worker. But after the revolution, Mongolia established a construction company in 1937, and the construction industry began to develop.

    In recent years, with the assistance of fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and China, Mongolia has further developed its construction industry, building a large number of industrial and mining enterprises, agriculture, animal husbandry, construction, roads, bridges, and residences. The construction area and construction investment have also increased year by year. The area of projects put into use in 1948 was 10,300 square meters, while in 1959 it increased by almost 19 times, reaching 200,000 square meters.

    The level of mechanization of construction work is also increasing year by year. Last year, 82% of the earthwork and high-altitude handling work on construction sites in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, was mechanized.

    In order to meet the needs of various constructions, Mongolia will also build building materials enterprises such as flat glass factories, cement factories, and timber processing factories with the help of fraternal countries in the future. According to the resolution on improving construction work made by the Central Committee and the government of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in early August, Mongolia's construction industry will develop at a faster rate in the future.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 19th: This year, Czechoslovakia's construction industry has achieved its best results in more than a decade in executing the first half of the year's plan.

    In the first half of this year, the production of building materials exceeded the first half of the year's plan by 1.6%, an increase of almost 13% compared with the same period last year.

    In the first half of this year, a total of more than 28,000 houses were built and put into use.

    Czechoslovakia attaches great importance to the industrialization of the construction industry. At present, projects built with prefabricated components have reached 30% of all construction projects. Many factories use highly mechanized production lines to produce ceilings, which can produce one ceiling every three minutes and fifty-four seconds. A production line for manufacturing vertical prefabricated components in a factory near Prague has begun production, and it can produce thirty-two different prefabricated components in twenty-four hours, while the entire production process only requires six workers to manage.

    At the same time, plastics are gradually being used to replace wood, steel, and non-ferrous metals in the construction industry in Czechoslovakia.

    The degree of mechanization of earthwork is constantly improving. To date, Czechoslovakia has mechanized 84% of its earthwork.

    蒙古建筑工业日益扩大
    捷建筑工业上半年计划执行良好
    新华社乌兰巴托22日电　随着工业和农牧业的迅速发展，蒙古人民共和国的建筑业日益扩大。1960年国家对建筑业的投资达两亿六千万图格里克，比1957年增加了36.8％。1959年交付使用的各项工程的面积为二十万平方米，等于1958年的二点二三倍。
    蒙古已经建立了年产二千五百万块砖的砖瓦厂、四座钢筋混凝土构件厂，以及一些中小型的砖瓦厂、石灰厂、木材加工厂等。目前，全国各级建筑技术干部和工人已达三万多人。乡村中也已建立起自己的建筑基地。
    蒙古的建筑业是在革命胜利后发展起来的。革命前，蒙古没有一座房子是自己盖的，也没有一个建筑工人。但在革命后，蒙古在1937年成立了建筑公司，建筑事业开始发展。
    最近几年来，蒙古在苏联、中国等兄弟国家的援助下，进一步发展了建筑业，修建了大批工矿企业、农牧业、建筑、公路、桥梁和住宅。建筑面积和建筑投资也逐年增加。1948年交付使用的工程面积为一万零三百平方米，而在1959年就增加了几乎十九倍，达到了二十万平方米。
    建筑工作的机械化水平也在逐年增长。去年，蒙古首都乌兰巴托市各工地有82％的土方工程和高空搬运工作实现了机械化。
    为了适应各项建设的需要，今后蒙古还将在各兄弟国家的帮助下，兴建平板玻璃厂、水泥厂、木材加工厂等建筑材料企业。根据蒙古人民革命党中央和政府8月初所作的关于改进建筑工作的决议，蒙古的建筑事业今后将以更快的速度发展。
    新华社布拉格19日电　今年捷克斯洛伐克的建筑工业在执行上半年计划方面取得了十多年来最好的成绩。
    今年上半年，建筑材料的生产超额1.6％完成了上半年的计划，比去年同时期几乎增加了13％。
    在今年上半年，共有二万八千多幢房屋建成并交付使用。
    捷克斯洛伐克很重视使建筑业实行工业化。目前用预制构件建筑的工程已达全部建筑工程的30％。许多工厂用高度机械化的生产线来生产天花板，这种生产线每三分五十四秒就能制造一块天花板。布拉格附近的一家工厂的一条制造立式预制构件的生产线已开始投入生产，它在二十四小时内能够生产三十二种不同的预制构件，而整个生产过程只需要六个工人看管。
    同时，在捷克斯洛伐克的建筑业中正在逐步地用塑料来代替木材、钢和有色金属等。
    土方工程的机械化程度在不断提高。到目前为止，捷克斯洛伐克已经有84％的土方工程机械化了。
