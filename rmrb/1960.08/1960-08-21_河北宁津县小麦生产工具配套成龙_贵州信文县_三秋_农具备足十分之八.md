Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin - Ningjin County, Hebei Province, made early arrangements for the production of various agricultural tools and machinery for the autumn harvest and planting, ensuring that the machinery needed for winter wheat production this year, from land preparation and sowing to harvesting, is fully integrated.

In early June, Ningjin County convened a meeting of responsible cadres from various machinery factories, iron and wood factories, and the first secretaries of commune Party committees to study and deploy the tool reform and manufacturing tasks for the third quarter. The requirements were to produce a large number of dense planting drills, deep plows, ridge makers for autumn plowing and planting, as well as potato plows, corn threshers, starch machines, and grain threshers for autumn harvesting; and to manufacture earth trucks, four-wheeled horse carts, and other transportation tools.

In the vigorous movement for tool reform for the autumn harvest and planting, Party committees at all levels, through the method of summarizing experience while manufacturing, promoting, and improving, made reasonable arrangements based on the technical characteristics of the workers, accelerating the speed of production. The TieMufactory in ChengGuan Commune, through rational allocation of manpower, not only manufactured more than 1,100 pieces of "Three Autumns" tools, but also repaired more than 17,000 pieces of old tools.

In order to ensure quality, all factories have established inspection and acceptance systems. The TieMu factory in Baodian Commune also launched a quality competition, so that all the more than 1,400 autumn harvest and planting tools manufactured by the factory were qualified and easy to use. At present, the county has produced 610 deep plows, 60 potato plows, 400 harrows, 420 ridge makers, and more than 200 other small agricultural tools for the autumn harvest and planting.

Xinhua News Agency - By the end of July, Xinwen County, Guizhou, had manufactured and promoted 120,000 new-style "Three Autumns" agricultural tools. The existing improved "Three Autumns" agricultural tools have reached more than 80% of the number needed for autumn production.

As early as the beginning of June, the Xinwen County Party Committee formulated a practical production plan. Large-scale production began in early July.

In order to complete the agricultural tool manufacturing tasks with quality, quantity, and on time, the county also divided four fronts according to the size, difficulty, and ease of the agricultural tools: The first front was the county-owned agricultural tool factory, mainly responsible for the manufacturing and improvement of large-scale tools with complex structures and high technical requirements; the second front was the agricultural tool factories of various communes, responsible for the trial production and production of general agricultural tools, and, to the best of their ability, producing some relatively large agricultural tools; the third front was the agricultural tool repair and assembly plants in the management areas and production teams, responsible for the repair and manufacturing of small agricultural tools; the fourth front was the vast number of commune members, responsible for the repair of stone rollers and threshing grounds, the production of bamboo agricultural tools, and the repair of other simple tools.

    河北宁津县小麦生产工具配套成龙
    贵州信文县“三秋”农具备足十分之八
    据新华社天津讯　河北省宁津县及早安排秋收秋种的各种农具、机械生产，使今年冬小麦生产需用的整地、播种一直到收割的机具全面配套成龙。
    宁津县在6月上旬就召开了各机械厂、铁木厂和公社党委第一书记等负责干部会议，研究部署了第三季度的工具改革和制造任务。要求今年要大量的生产秋耕、秋种用的密植耧、深耕犁、畦田器和秋收方面的刨薯犁、玉米脱粒机、淀粉机、谷物脱粒机；并制造土汽车、四轮马车等运输工具。
    在大搞秋收秋种工具改革运动中，各级党委通过边总结经验、边制造、边推广、边提高的办法，根据工人的技术特点，把制造、改革修配传授技术，作了合理安排，加快了生产速度。城关公社铁木厂通过合理安排人力，不光制造三秋工具一千一百多件，还将一万七千多件旧有的工具修配好。
    为了保证质量，各工厂都建立了检查验收制度。保店公社铁木厂还开展了优质竞赛，使全厂制造出来的一千四百多台秋收秋种工具，台台合格，台台好使。目前，全县已制出深耕犁六百一十台，刨薯犁六十部，齿耙四百部，畦田器四百二十多部，还有其他秋收秋种小农具二百多件。
    据新华社讯　贵州信文县到7月底制造推广了十二万件新式“三秋”农具，现有的“三秋”改良农具，已达到秋季生产需要数的80％以上。
    中共信文县委早在6月初，制订出切实可行的生产计划。7月初就开始大规模生产。
    为了按质按量按时完成农具制造任务，全县还按照农具的大、小、难、易划分了四条战线：第一条战线是县属农具厂，主要负责结构复杂的、技术性较强的大型工具的制造和改良工作；第二条战线是各公社农具厂，负责一般农具的试制和生产，在力所能及的情况下，生产一些比较大型的农具；第三条战线是管理区、生产队的农具修配厂，负责小型农具的修理和制造；第四条战线是广大社员，负责石磙、场坝的修整，竹器农具的生产和其它简单工具的修补。
