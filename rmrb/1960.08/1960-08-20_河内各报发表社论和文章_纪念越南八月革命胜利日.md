Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 19th: Hanoi newspapers published editorials, articles, and historical photographs today to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the victory of the August Revolution in Vietnam. The "People's Daily," in its editorial entitled "A Lesson of History," stated, "The August Revolution is a clever combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Vietnamese revolution, and it is a victory for the national democratic movement in the era of imperialist decline and the growth of socialism into a world system."

The editorial also pointed out, "The victory of the August Revolution is the result of the clever combination and application of military and political struggle, and violent and peaceful means." The editorial said, "Our Party attaches importance to armed struggle, using armed struggle to promote the political struggle of the whole country. At the same time, our Party pays attention to various forms of political struggle."

The editorial pointed out, "The experience of the August Revolution tells us that it is necessary to continuously strengthen the Party's leadership over the country, strengthen the dictatorship, expand democracy, continuously improve revolutionary vigilance, and resolutely smash the conspiracies of counter-revolutionaries at home and abroad. Only in this way can we adhere to and develop the achievements of the revolution and promote the continuous advancement of the revolution."

Today's expanded edition of the "People's Daily" also published commemorative articles written by Nguyen Duy Trinh, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, and Nguyen Khang, a member of the Central Committee, as well as revolutionary memoirs and poems written by some August Revolution veterans, and a large number of historical photos related to the August Revolution.

"New Era Daily" and "Hanoi Capital Daily" also published commemorative articles today.

August 19, 1945, was the day when the people of Hanoi rose up, seized power from the Japanese army, and established a provisional revolutionary government. On September 2 of the same year, Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Vietnamese Provisional Revolutionary Government, declared Vietnam's independence in Hanoi. The Vietnamese government designated August 19 as the August Revolution Commemoration Day and September 2 as National Day.
