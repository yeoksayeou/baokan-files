    Always Be Thrifty
    Wu Lü
    Many people know of the Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant. Knowing it is not because this plant has any particularly large scale or particularly advanced equipment; the Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant is famous for its thrifty start. In September 1958, when this plant was only two months old and had only two small blast furnaces, the Beijing Daily had already reported their touching deeds of running a business thriftily on the front page. It turned out that this small factory was built on a reed pond with old bricks from the city wall. Before the factory was built, there was only a pigsty of an agricultural cooperative and a small earthen house for the breeder besides the clumps of reeds. After the factory was built, this small earthen house became the factory's office. At that time, the workers in the factory wrote a poem saying: "Don't compare eating, don't compare wearing, only compare hard work and solid work, today we shed happy sweat, to make future generations sweet."
    Now, nearly two years have passed. Today's news says that the Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant has become an iron and steel plant with nine small blast furnaces and four converters and electric furnaces. The development of production should really be "a scholar who has been away for three days must be looked at with new eyes." However, there are also "still the same old me" places in the Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant, that is, the entire plant still maintains the kind of hard-working and simple style when the factory was built. The office is mainly in the work shed left over from the construction of the factory; nurseries, barbershops, clubs, etc., must be run well and not spend much money. Non-productive expenses are used as little as possible, non-productive personnel are used as little as possible, and the money spent on production is also saved as much as possible. This consistent thrifty style is very touching.
    It is very valuable for an enterprise to start thriftily when its material conditions are very difficult and not to shout about difficulties; it is even more valuable to maintain a thrifty style when its material conditions are better. Some people say: "It is easy to go from thrift to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to thrift." When material conditions get better, some people often easily forget the word "thrift" and approach the word "extravagance." After the production of the Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant developed, didn't some people also have the ideological activity of "the factory looks like something, we should build a movie theater and buy a movie projector"? It's just that the road from thrift to extravagance that a few people wanted to take was blocked by the majority of workers, and the thrifty style continued to be developed in the struggle against this kind of thinking.
    We advocate eternal thrift. The road from thrift to extravagance will always be "no passage" in our country. The reason is very simple. Extravagance is the style of the exploiting class, who use squandering and waste to show off their luxury. This is a manifestation of the declining and decaying class. Thrift is the virtue of the working people. The working people save food and clothing to build socialism. This is a manifestation of the advanced class being vigorous and vigorous. Our country has achieved the basic victory of the socialist revolution, and the emerging working class and the broad masses of working people are the masters of the country. We should maintain the virtues of the working class and never take the road from thrift to extravagance.
    Of course, the struggle between thrift and extravagance will still exist. Because the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie still exists. Thinking that material conditions are better, you can not be thrifty, you can go from thrift to extravagance, from the perspective of ideological understanding, you do not understand that running an enterprise thriftily is a long-term policy that should be implemented at any time; from the perspective of estimating the material situation, you do not understand that although our country's material conditions are much better than in the past, the situation of "poor and blank" has not fundamentally changed and still needs to be worked hard; from a social point of view, it is a manifestation of the influence of bourgeois ideology. The Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant rejected this ideological influence and insisted on a thrifty style, setting an example for us and is very worthy of our study.

    永远勤俭
    吴滤
    不少人都知道有一个宣武钢铁厂。知道它，倒不是因为这个厂有什么特别大的规模，或是特别先进的设备；宣武钢铁厂的出名，是勤俭起家的缘故。1958年9月，当这个厂诞生不过两月，还只有两座小高炉的时候，北京日报就曾经以头版头条的地位报道过他们勤俭办企业的感人事迹。原来，这个小厂是在一个苇塘上用城墙上的旧砖建起来的。建厂前，那里除了丛丛苇草以外，只有一个农业社的猪圈和一间饲养员住的小土房。建厂后，这个小土房变成了工厂的办公室。当时，厂里的工人做诗说：“不比吃来不比穿，只比苦干和实干，今天流下幸福汗，要让子孙万代甜。”
    如今，将近两年的时间过去了。今天报上的消息说，宣武钢铁厂已经成为拥有九座小高炉和四座转炉、电炉的钢铁厂了。生产的发展，真应该“士别三日，刮目相看”。然而，在宣武钢铁厂也有“依然故我”的地方，这就是全厂仍然保持着建厂时那种艰苦朴素的作风。办公，主要是在建厂时留下的工棚里；托儿所、理发室、俱乐部等等，也都是既要办好，又要不多花钱。非生产性的开支尽可能少用，非生产的人员尽可能少用，生产上要花的钱也尽可能地节省。这种一贯勤俭的作风，很令人感动。
    一个企业，在物质条件很困难的时候，没有叫喊困难，靠着勤俭起家，是很可贵的；到了物质条件好了起来，也还保持着勤俭的作风，是更可贵的。有人说：“由俭入奢易，由奢入俭难”，当物质条件好了起来的时候，有些人往往是很容易忘掉了俭字，而接近了奢字的。宣武钢铁厂的生产发展以后，不是也有人有过“工厂像个样子了，应该盖电影院、买电影机了”的思想活动吗？只不过少数人所想的这条由俭入奢的路被广大职工堵住了，勤俭的作风在同这种思想作斗争中继续得到发扬。
    我们是主张永远勤俭的。由俭入奢的道路，在我们的国家里永远是“此路不通”。道理很简单。奢是剥削阶级的作风，他们以挥霍浪费来显示自己的豪华。这是没落腐朽阶级的表现。俭则是劳动人民的美德，劳动人民节衣缩食建设社会主义，这是先进阶级朝气勃勃的表现。我们的国家取得了社会主义革命的基本胜利，新兴的工人阶级和广大劳动人民是国家的主人。我们就应保持工人阶级的美德，永远不走由俭入奢的道路。
    当然，俭和奢的斗争还是会有的。因为资产阶级的思想影响仍然存在。以为物质条件好了起来，就可以不要勤俭了，就可以由俭入奢了，从思想认识上来说，是不了解勤俭办企业是任何时候都应该贯彻的长期的方针；从对物质情况的估计来说，是不了解我们国家的物质条件虽然比过去好得多了，但是“一穷二白”的情况还没有根本改变，仍然需要努力；从社会原因来说，则是资产阶级思想影响的一种表现。宣武钢铁厂拒绝了这种思想的影响，坚持勤俭的作风，为我们树立了一个榜样，很值得我们学习。
