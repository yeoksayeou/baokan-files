    Increase Pesticide Production to Guarantee Autumn Harvest
    Increasing pesticide production and providing sufficient pesticides for agricultural production in a timely manner to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests is an important measure for industry to support agriculture and guarantee increased agricultural production.
    The growth of crops, from sowing to harvest, requires constant struggle against various natural disasters. In addition to fighting drought and floods, it is also necessary to fight against plant diseases and insect pests. Pesticides are effective weapons in the fight against plant diseases and insect pests.
    Before liberation, China's pesticide manufacturing industry was almost non-existent. Farmers had no way to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests. The only solution was to pray to gods and worship Buddha. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the chemical industry developed rapidly. In 1959, the country produced more than 137,000 tons of chemical pesticides alone, an increase of 67% over 1958. In addition, many indigenous pesticide factories were established throughout the country. For example, Santai County in Sichuan Province established more than 3,320 indigenous pesticide factories, producing 90.1 million catties of indigenous pesticides last year, with an average application of 61 catties per mu. In 1959, the county experienced a severe drought, resulting in particularly serious plant diseases and insect pests. They adopted a combination of regular prevention and control with concentrated campaigns, using indigenous pesticides to launch fierce attacks. As a result, the major spring crops in 64 communes (accounting for 67% of the county's land area) basically eliminated plant diseases and insect pests. This year, the county has further taken measures and has now basically become a "disease and pest-free county."
    This year, China's agriculture has again suffered from severe drought and major floods in some areas, but thanks to the arduous efforts of all farmers and the support from all sides, great victories have been achieved in the fight against disasters. Now, plant diseases and insect pests are developing rapidly in various places. Therefore, pesticide production departments should do everything possible to produce more and better pesticides for agricultural production, support farmers in overcoming insect pests, and guarantee the autumn harvest.
    In order to promote agricultural production, we must do everything possible to massively increase pesticide production. While increasing production, we must also continuously improve the quality of pesticides. For the same type of pesticide, good quality means higher insecticidal efficiency, and scattering it on the ground can have several times the effect. If we do not pay attention to quality, and the insecticidal efficiency of the drug is very low, it will cause waste. More is not good, and it is actually not more at all. In addition to guaranteeing quantity and quality, we must also have a variety of products. Because China has a vast territory, with huge differences in climate between north and south, and the growing conditions of crops are different, there are many types of agricultural plant diseases and insect pests, and there must be drugs suitable for various plant diseases and insect pests. There must be insecticides, as well as fungicides; there must be drugs that can kill adult insects, as well as drugs that can kill insect eggs. Although the varieties of pesticides have increased a lot in recent years, with the development of agricultural production, the requirements for the chemical industry are getting higher and higher. Therefore, it is necessary to increase more pesticide varieties to meet the needs from more aspects. In the future, pesticide research departments should continue to study pesticides that are harmless to humans and animals, have multiple uses, are low in cost, and are easy to use. In addition to producing various insecticides and fungicides, we must also produce plant stimulants that help crop growth, fumigants and preservatives for warehouse use, insecticides that are harmless to beneficial insects such as bees, and various herbicides produced to save labor. These are all new types of pesticides that urgently need to be increased in the future.
    Accelerating pesticide production must also implement the policy of walking on two legs, that is, attaching equal importance to chemical pesticides and indigenous pesticides; attaching equal importance to modern production methods and indigenous production methods. In the past few years, chemical pesticide production has mainly relied on some modern enterprises. In the future, pesticide production and research work, the training of technical personnel, etc., must also rely on these enterprises, which are the backbone of the pesticide manufacturing industry. However, on the other hand, the role of indigenous pesticide factories must never be ignored. The output of these indigenous pesticide factories accounts for a large proportion of the country, and these pesticide factories are quick to build, require little investment, and are quick to produce results. They can make full use of the abundant local mineral resources, produce locally, and use locally. Developing small indigenous groups and small modern groups of pesticide factories in a planned way is the correct way to develop China's pesticide industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    The key to massively increasing pesticide production at present is the raw material problem. There are many varieties of pesticides, and the required raw materials are also of many varieties and large quantities. Some raw materials involve many departments, such as copper, mercury, and alcohol, which must rely on the metallurgical and light industry departments for supply. To increase production, there must be sufficient raw materials. Therefore, to massively increase pesticide production, we must first focus on the production of pesticide raw materials. The method of grasping raw materials is to rely on relevant departments to supply raw materials in complete sets, and to rely on pesticide manufacturing industries to establish and expand raw material production bases themselves. In addition, it is also very important for provinces to cooperate well with each other and share what they have. In the past, many provinces relied on the support of Shanxi, Hebei and other provinces for the chloro-oil used to produce Dipterex. In the future, this spirit of communist cooperation should continue to be carried forward. To massively increase pesticide production, in addition to focusing on raw material production, we must also focus on saving raw materials. At present, some pesticide factories have great potential for raw materials. For example, when producing the same type of pesticide, using the same production methods, some enterprises have very high raw material consumption quotas, while others have very low quotas. If everyone aims at the most advanced indicators, a lot of pesticides can be produced. Another good way to increase pesticide raw materials is to open up new sources of raw materials. There are many ways to do this. For example, coal tar by-products, furfural, and many minerals such as barite, orpiment, and realgar can be used as pesticide raw materials. Recycling by-products and comprehensive utilization are also issues that deserve special attention in pesticide production. In the chemical pesticide production process, there are many by-products. If they can all be recovered and utilized, pesticide production can be increased without increasing raw materials.
    There are many ways to increase pesticide production, and the potential is great. The current situation is very favorable to us. The current problem is to launch a campaign to increase production and conserve resources in all pesticide production departments, continue to deepen technological innovation and technological revolution, rapidly and universally promote advanced experiences in increasing pesticide production, and mobilize the masses in every workshop and every group to discuss production increase plans. Specific measures must be formulated to complete the monthly, ten-day, and daily plans to ensure the realization of the production increase and conservation plan. All workers and comrades in the pesticide industry, take action immediately, increase pesticide production, and promote the autumn harvest of agriculture!

    增产农药保证秋季丰收
    增产农药、及时给农业生产提供足够的防治病虫害的药品，是工业支援农业，保证农业增产的一个重要措施。
    农作物的成长，从播种，一直到收获，要不断地和各种自然灾害作斗争。除了和旱灾、水灾作斗争外，还要和病虫害作斗争。农药就是和病虫害作斗争的有效武器。
    解放以前，我国农药制造业几乎是个空白点。农民遇到病虫害根本无法防治。唯一的办法，只有求神拜佛。解放后，在党的领导下，化学工业发展很快，1959年，全国仅化学农药就生产了十三万七千多吨，比1958年增长67％，除此之外全国还办了许多土农药厂。如四川三台县就建立了土农药厂三千三百二十多个，去年生产土农药九千零一十万斤，全县平均每亩地施用六十一斤。1959年这个县遇到了大旱灾，因而病虫害特别严重，他们采取经常防治和突击相结合的办法，用土农药猛攻猛打，结果有六十四个公社（占全县土地面积67％）的大春作物基本上消灭了病虫害。今年这个县又进一步采取措施，现在已经基本上成为“无病虫害县”。
    今年，我国农业又遭受了严重的旱灾和部分地区的大水灾，但是由于全体农民的艰巨努力和各方面对农业的支援，取得了抗灾斗争的巨大胜利。现在各地农作物的病虫害又发展很快；因此农药生产的部门，应该千方百计，为农业增产更多更好的农药，支援农民战胜虫害，保证秋季丰收。
    为了促进农业的增产，我们必须想尽一切办法大量增产农药。在增加产量的同时，还必须不断提高农药的质量。同样一种农药，质量好，杀虫效率就高，撒在地里就可以起几倍的作用。如果不注意质量，药品杀虫效率很低，就会造成浪费，多而不好，实际上等于不多。保证了数量、质量，还必须多品种。因为我国地域辽阔，南北气候相差悬殊，加上农作物生长条件不同，农业病虫害的种类繁多，必须有适应各种病虫害的药物。要有杀虫剂，也要有杀菌剂；要有能杀成虫的药，也要有杀虫卵的药。近几年农药的品种虽然增加很多，但随着农业生产的发展，对化学工业的要求越来越高，因此，就必须增加更多的农药品种，从更多方面满足需要。今后农药研究部门应该继续研究对人畜无害、多种用途、成本低廉、使用方便的农药。除了生产各种杀虫杀菌药以外，还要生产帮助农作物生长的植物刺激素，仓库使用的熏蒸剂、防腐剂，对蜜蜂等益虫无害的杀虫药剂，以及为了节省劳动力而生产各种锄草剂。这些都是今后急待增加的新品种农药。
    加速农药生产，也必须贯彻两条腿走路的方针，这就是化学农药和土农药并重；洋法生产同土法生产并重。过去几年来，化学农药生产主要依靠一些现代化企业，今后农药生产和研究工作，技术力量的培养等等，也还必须依靠这些企业，它们是农药制造业的骨干。但是另一方面绝不可忽视土农药厂的作用。这些土农药厂的产量，在全国占很大比重，并且这种农药厂建厂快，投资少，收效快，可以充分利用当地丰富的矿物资源，就地生产，就地使用。有计划地发展小土群、小洋群的农药厂，这是多快好省发展我国农药工业的正确途径。
    当前大量增产农药的关键是原料问题。农药的品种很多，需要的原料也是品种多、数量大。有些原料涉及很多部门，如铜、汞、酒精，必须依靠冶金和轻工业部门供应。要想增产，必须有足够的原料。因此要大量增产农药，首先必须大抓农药原料生产。抓原料的方法，一是依靠有关部门成套供应原料，一是农药制造业要自己建立和扩大原料生产基地。另外，省和省之间搞好协作，互通有无也是很重要的。过去很多省份生产敌百虫所用的氯油，都依靠山西、河北等省的支援，今后还应继续发扬这种共产主义协作精神。要大量增产农药，除了大抓原料生产外，还要大抓节约使用原料。现在有些农药工厂原料潜力很大，如生产同样一种农药，生产方法相同，有的企业原料消耗定额很高，有的企业却很低，如果都向最先进指标看齐，就可以增产很多农药。增产农药原料还有一个好办法，这就是开辟新的原料来源，这方面门路也很多，比如煤焦油的副产品、糠醛和许多矿物如重晶石、雌黄、雄黄都可以作为农药的原料。回收副产品和综合利用，也是农药生产中特别值得注意的问题。化学农药生产过程中，副产物很多，如果都能回收利用，不增加原料就可以增产农药。
    增产农药的办法很多，潜力很大。当前的形势对我们很有利，现在的问题是要在所有农药生产部门展开一个增产节约运动，继续深入开展技术革新和技术革命，迅速普遍推广增产农药的先进经验，并且在每个车间每个小组深入发动群众，讨论增产计划，要订出完成每月、每旬、每天计划的具体措施，保证增产节约计划的实现。农药行业的全体职工同志们，立即行动起来，增产农药，促进农业的秋季丰收！
