Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 13th: This year, the Soviet Union has built approximately four hundred new industrial enterprises and many new industrial facilities. Including those built last year, the Soviet Union has constructed over one thousand four hundred new factories and mines since the beginning of the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965).

The progress of basic construction in the Soviet Union has been rapid this year. In the first six months of this year, the amount of construction work completed by basic construction workers across the Soviet Union was more than double the total amount of construction work completed during the First Five-Year Plan (1928-1932). In the electric power industry, power station builders overfulfilled their construction and installation work volume and plans to put new generating capacity into production in the first half of this year. Some powerful generator units at the Baltic Thermal Power Station, Simferopol Thermal Power Station, Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station, and Kremenchug Hydroelectric Power Station were completed and put into production ahead of schedule. Builders doubled their labor productivity compared to the original target. In the steel industry, from late May to mid-July alone, two blast furnaces, two open-hearth furnaces, six rolling mills, and some new workshops were built. The "2800 type" rolling mill at the Orsk-Khalilovo Steel Integrated Plant was originally scheduled to be completed at the end of this year, but construction workers nearly doubled the construction speed, resulting in the rolling mill being put into production at the end of March this year. A powerful "250 type" wire drawing machine at the Krivoy Rog Steel Plant was built in just four months, which is rare in the history of the world's metallurgical industry.

The completion and commissioning of a large number of new enterprises and new equipment has increased new production capacity in all industrial sectors of the Soviet Union. In terms of production capacity and scale, many of these new enterprises and equipment are among the best in the Soviet Union, or even in the world. For example, the first phase of the Ukrainian Yanovsky Hydraulic Coal Mine, which has been completed, is not only the largest coal mining enterprise in the republic, but also the largest hydraulic coal mine in the world. The amount of coal mined by a hydraulic excavator operator in one work shift is equal to the total amount of coal mined by a coal mining combined team of twelve workers in one shift. Another example is the Gobelenov Textile Factory, which has completed its second phase of construction and is one of the largest textile factories in Europe, capable of producing three million meters of fabric annually.

This newspaper reports that the electrification of the world's largest Soviet Siberian Railway trunk line from Moscow to Irkutsk, a distance of over four thousand kilometers, has been completed. Express trains pulled by electric locomotives departing from Moscow Station pass through Ryazan, Kuibyshev, Ufa, Chelyabinsk, Kurgan, all the way to Lake Baikal.

This year, railway construction workers completed the electrification project of the three hundred and forty-eight kilometer railway from Sasovo to Moinzha. The electrified railways of Moscow and Kuibyshev have been connected. The express train from Moscow to Kuibyshev originally took twenty-four hours, but now it only takes sixteen hours with an electric locomotive.

While implementing electrification, other new developments have also emerged in railway work. Employees of the Kuibyshev Railway Trunk Line have increased the length of "traction load." Now, only one locomotive is used to pull the entire railway line from beginning to end. The demand for locomotives has been reduced, and there is less need for eleven locomotive depots. This can save seventy million rubles annually. (Attached picture)

### 苏联今年已建成约四百个新企业  西伯利亚铁路干线已有四千多公里实现电气化

    苏联今年已建成约四百个新企业
    西伯利亚铁路干线已有四千多公里实现电气化
    新华社莫斯科13日电　今年以来，苏联又建成了约四百个新的工业企业以及许多新的工业设备。连同去年建成的算在一起，从七年计划（1959—1965年）开始到现在，苏联总共已经建成了一千四百个以上新的厂矿企业。
    今年苏联基本建设的进展速度很快。在今年头六个月内，苏联各地基本建设工人所完成的建筑工作量，就比第一个五年计划（1928—1932年）期间完成的全部建筑工作量还多一倍。在电力工业中，电站建设者在今年上半年超额完成了建筑安装工作量和使新发电能力投入生产的计划。波罗的海火力发电站、森佛罗波尔火力发电站、斯大林格勒水电站和克列门楚格水电站的一些功率强大的联动机，都是提前建成和投入生产的。建设者们把劳动生产率比原订指标提高了一倍。在钢铁工业中，单是在5月下旬到7月中旬，就建成了两座高炉、两座平炉、六座轧钢机和一些新车间。奥尔斯克—哈里洛夫斯克钢铁联合工厂的“2800型”轧钢机，原是在今年年底建成，但是，建筑工人由于把建设速度差不多提高了一倍，结果使轧钢机提前在今年3月底投入生产。克里沃罗格钢铁工厂的一座强大的“250型”拉丝机，只用四个月就建成了，这在世界冶金工业史上是少见的。
    大批新企业、新设备的建成和投入生产，使苏联所有的工业部门都增加了新的生产能力。就生产能力和规模来说，这些新企业和设备中，有不少在苏联、甚至在全世界都是数一数二的。例如，第一期工程已经竣工的乌克兰雅诺夫斯基水力煤矿，不但是共和国最大的采煤企业，也是世界上最大的水力煤矿，它的一个水力挖掘机手在一个工作班中的采掘量就等于由十二个工人组成的采煤联合机队在一班的总采煤量。又如，已经完成了第二期工程的戈别列诺夫纺织工厂，就是欧洲最大的纺织厂之一，它每年可以生产三百万米织品。
    本报讯　世界上最大的苏联西伯利亚大铁路干线从莫斯科到伊尔库茨克这段四千多公里的途程已经电气化。从莫斯科车站开出的由电气机车牵引的快车，经过梁赞、古比雪夫、乌发、车里雅宾斯克、库尔干，一直到贝加尔湖。
    今年，铁路建设工人完成了从沙索沃到莫英扎的三百四十八公里的铁路的电气化工程。莫斯科和古比雪夫的电气化铁路已经衔接起来。从莫斯科到古比雪夫的特别快车本来要行驶二十四小时，用电气机车后只需行驶十六小时。
    在实行电气化的同时，铁路工作还出现了其它的新鲜事物。古比雪夫铁路干线的员工们，增加了“牵引负荷”的长度。现在，在整条铁路线上自始至终只用一台机车牵引。机车的需要量减少了，也就不大需要十一个机务段了。这样每年可以节约七千万卢布。（附图片）
