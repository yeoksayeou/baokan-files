Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 17th: The Eighth National Congress of the Cuban People's Socialist Party solemnly opened in Havana yesterday morning. This is the first national congress held by the People's Socialist Party after the victory of the revolution; the previous congress was held in 1952. One hundred and ninety-two delegates from across the country are participating in this congress.

When representatives of fraternal parties from China, France, Czechoslovakia, North Korea, Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, Indonesia, Poland, Chile, Venezuela, Canada, Ecuador, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Argentina, Hungary, the United States, Guadeloupe, Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia, Jamaica, Martinique, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, and Spain entered the venue, enthusiastic applause resounded throughout the hall.

Representatives from the Cuban "July 26th Movement," the Revolutionary Directorate, and the Cuban Workers' Confederation, who were invited to attend the meeting as observers, were also warmly welcomed at the congress.

Lazaro Peña, a member of the National Executive Committee of the People's Socialist Party, pointed out in his opening speech that "Our national congress coincides with the Organization of American States meeting being held in Costa Rica. If American imperialism is ultimately able to concentrate the votes of subservient countries in its conspiracy-plotting meeting room to oppose Cuba, then the people of Costa Rica, the people of Latin America, and the people of all countries will rise up now and in the future to smash the attempts of American imperialists to interfere and invade."

Peña also said, "However, as we begin our congress here, we are confident of the justice of our cause, confident that it will inevitably triumph; we are confident that, no matter what the conditions and circumstances under which Cuba continues to struggle for national independence, our people will surely achieve victory!"

Subsequently, the party's General Secretary, Blas Roca, delivered a general report on the work of the party.

The congress is continuing to hold meetings.

    古巴人民社会党代表大会开幕
    全国执行局委员培尼亚致开幕词指出古巴人民正义斗争必将胜利
    新华社哈瓦那17日电　古巴人民社会党第八次全国代表大会昨天上午在哈瓦那隆重开幕。这是人民社会党在革命胜利后举行的第一次全国代表大会，上一次代表大会是在1952年举行的。参加这次大会的有全国的一百九十二位代表。
    当中国、法国、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜、保加利亚、德意志民主共和国、印度尼西亚、波兰、智利、委内瑞拉、加拿大、厄瓜多尔、乌拉圭、哥斯达黎加、阿根廷、匈牙利、美国、瓜达罗普岛、哥伦比亚、巴西、玻利维亚、牙买加、马提尼克、危地马拉、多米尼加和西班牙的兄弟党的代表进入会场的时候，会场上响起热烈的掌声。
    应邀列席会议的古巴“7月26日运动”、革命指导委员会和古巴工人联合会的代表在大会上也受到热烈欢迎。
    人民社会党全国执行局委员拉萨罗·培尼亚在开幕词中指出，“我们的全国代表大会恰巧同在哥斯达黎加举行的美洲国家组织会议同时召开。如果美帝国主义最后在其策划阴谋的会议室中能够集中仆从国家的投票来反对古巴的话，那么在会外的哥斯达黎加人民，拉丁美洲人民和世界各国人民现在和将来都要起来粉碎美帝国主义者干涉和侵略的企图”。
    培尼亚还说，“然而，当我们在这里开始举行我们的代表大会的时候，我们确信我们事业的正义性，确信它必定胜利；我们确信，无论古巴继续为民族独立而斗争的条件和环境如何，我国人民都必将取得胜利！”
    接着，党的总书记布拉斯·罗加作了关于党的工作的总报告。
    代表大会在继续举行会议。
