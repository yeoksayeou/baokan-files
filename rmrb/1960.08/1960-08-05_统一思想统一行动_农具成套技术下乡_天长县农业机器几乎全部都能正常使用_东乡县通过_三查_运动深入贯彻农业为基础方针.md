Unify Thinking and Action, Complete Sets of Agricultural Technology Go to the Countryside
　　Tianchang County's Agricultural Machinery is Almost Entirely Operational
　　Dongxiang County Deeply Implements the Policy of Taking Agriculture as the Foundation Through the "Three Checks" Movement

　　This newspaper reports: How can we ensure that everything supporting agriculture, every yuan, every technology, and every person plays its role as quickly and to the greatest extent possible? Tianchang County, Anhui Province, used the method of comprehensive and thorough support to solve this problem effectively.

　　Organizing all sectors of society to support agriculture and promote rapid agricultural development is an important guiding ideology for Tianchang County's leadership of agricultural production. Because the county has grasped this work firmly and meticulously, the achievements of all sectors of society in supporting agriculture are very significant.

　　In addition to organizing and mobilizing all possible urban labor to support agriculture, the county also pays attention to closely combining material supply with capital investment; closely combining the complete set production of products with the repair and assembly of products; closely combining the promotion of new tools with technology transfer; and adopting the method of carrying things through to the end, delivering support for agriculture directly into the hands of farmers.

　　When leading this work, Tianchang County first did a good job in political and ideological work, enabling employees in all departments to firmly establish the idea of serving agricultural production. Under the leadership of the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, the heads of industry and transportation, finance and trade, and cultural and educational units participated in the formation of an Agricultural Support Committee to strengthen the unified leadership of all industries in supporting agriculture. The committee, according to the needs of agricultural production at the time, promptly studied and arranged the work of all sectors of society to support agricultural production. For example, the commercial department purchased some inner and outer tires, steel wire, and other parts for rubber-tired carts, but lacked accessories such as chucks and axles. Originally, the industrial department did not arrange the production tasks of these rubber-tired cart accessories in its production plan. In reviewing the plans of various departments, the committee instructed the industrial department to supplement and formulate a production plan for rubber-tired cart accessories. After the meeting, the industrial department organized eleven county and commune factories, and in ten days, they rushed to assemble and install 1,200 rubber-tired carts, which played a timely role in agriculture. For example, in order to support agriculture, the industrial department built a fertilizer factory, which produced more than 500 tons of calcium-potassium fertilizer in the first four months of this year. However, because many farmers did not know how to use it, and some communes lacked the funds to purchase fertilizer, only more than ten tons were supplied to the communes. According to this situation, the committee decided to organize the forces of industry, finance, and technology departments to try their best to solve this problem. The science and technology department organized more than 50 technical cadres, printed more than 1,200 technical materials, and carried out technical teaching and publicity work to the commune members, so that the commune members understood the production-increasing effect and use technology of calcium-potassium fertilizer. The bank also issued 62,200 yuan in loans to help the communes purchase calcium-potassium fertilizer. In this way, more than 500 tons of calcium-potassium fertilizer were all supplied to the communes. At the same time, various departments also adopted various methods to strengthen cooperation between departments to achieve coordinated operations. For example, the industrial, repair and technology departments adopted the method of holding regular or temporary joint meetings and exchanging plans with each other to combine the promotion, repair and technology transfer of new tools. The repair department, according to the promotion of new tools, set up eight repair stations in the county, and often sent technicians to patrol and repair in various places. This year, it helped the communes repair more than 80,000 pieces of agricultural tools. The science and technology department carried out technical teaching work as soon as the new tools were out of the factory. This year, it adopted various methods to train 450 technicians and 1,258 new tool users for the communes.

　　Tianchang County's various industries have achieved great results in supporting agriculture. In the first half of this year, the total amount of production materials supplied by the commercial department to the countryside reached more than 610,000 yuan, an increase of nearly two times compared with the same period last year. Among them, the supply of new tools such as deep plows, improved harrows, and rubber-tired carts and fertilizers has increased even faster. These production materials supported by various industries have effectively played a role in agricultural production. According to a recent survey by relevant departments, this year the people's communes have added and made 9,952 deep plows, 5,890 improved harrows, 323 wind-powered waterwheels, and 44 water pumps. 95% to 98% of these agricultural machines can be used normally. This year, the bank lent 656,000 yuan to the communes, and more than 90% of the money was used for production.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, August 4th. Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, recently launched a "Three Checks" movement in the whole party and the whole people to check organizational leadership, check ideological understanding, and check weak links in agricultural production. Through this movement, the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation has been further established among all cadres, and a new situation of responding to every call has emerged in the county's agricultural production.

The Dongxiang County Party Committee recently adopted the method of taking the virtual to drive the real, discussing the virtual based on the real, and combining the virtual and the real in the whole party and the whole people. From the county party committee, commune party committee, production brigade general branch, production team branch, to the vast number of people's commune members, finance and trade, industry, transportation and other departments, they have all launched a movement of checking organizational leadership, checking ideological understanding, and checking weak links in agricultural production in accordance with the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation. The results of the "Three Checks" show that, in terms of organizational leadership, although the county party committee and the commune party committee have grasped agricultural production firmly, there are still many shortcomings. The main problems are: the county party committee and the commune party committee have not invested the maximum leadership strength into the agricultural front, and there is still a phenomenon of dividing forces and guarding areas, sometimes forming a situation where industry and agriculture are not distinguished by importance. Some cadres in the industrial department exposed departmentalism when encountering practical problems such as labor allocation and mechanical power distribution. The finance and trade system has made great achievements in supporting agricultural production, but due to the "follow-the-leader" mentality of some cadres, the support for agricultural production is not active enough.

According to the problems found in the "Three Checks," Dongxiang County has formulated various important measures to strengthen organizational leadership and overcome weak links. In order to strengthen the organizational leadership of agricultural production, the county party committee and county-level organs implemented a "three-eight" system, that is, 80% of the county party committee members, 80% of the time, and 80% of the organ cadres go to the forefront of agricultural production. The county party committee transferred ten county party committee members from the organs and the industrial and capital construction fronts to serve as real positions in the communes. Of the forty-seven county party committee members in the county, thirty-seven are leading agricultural production, increasing the leadership strength of the agricultural front by one-third. The county party committee also stipulated that each county party committee member who goes to the commune must establish his own production base, that is, to grasp a thousand mu of high-yield fields, run a public canteen well, and manage a pig farm well. The first secretary of the county party committee took the lead in going to the worst commune and grasped a low-yielding field of eight hundred mu that had always had low yields. After that, the cadres of the communes, brigades, and production teams also established their own production bases in the same way.

The unity of understanding of taking agriculture as the foundation and the strengthening of agricultural organizational leadership have quickly created a new situation in the county's agricultural production where one call brings a hundred responses. When drought occurred in some places, the industrial department took the initiative to send more than ten water pumps to the agricultural department for use. In order to ensure that agricultural production has sufficient labor, all capital construction units in the county automatically suspended many unplanned construction projects, giving up nearly ten thousand labor force for agricultural production. Factories such as sugar refining actively extracted more than ten trucks to help transport seeds, farm tools, and fertilizers in order to help agriculture solve the difficulty of insufficient labor in summer harvesting and summer planting. The industrial and transportation departments borrowed more than ten tractors from the agricultural department and have sent special personnel to deliver them. In order to promote agricultural production, the finance and trade departments not only automatically helped the agricultural department investigate the shortage of plowing cattle, farm tools, and production funds for summer harvesting and summer planting, but also timely issued 400,000 yuan in loans to support summer harvesting and summer planting according to needs.

    统一思想统一行动　农具成套技术下乡
    天长县农业机器几乎全部都能正常使用
    东乡县通过“三查”运动深入贯彻农业为基础方针
    本报讯　怎样使支援农业的每一样东西，每一元钱，每一种技术，每一个人，最快、最大限度地发挥作用？安徽天长县各行各业用全面支援、支援到底的办法，切实地解决了这个问题。
    组织各行各业支援农业，促进农业生产迅速发展，是天长县领导农业生产的重要指导思想。由于这个县对这项工作抓得狠、抓得细，各行各业支援农业的成绩就很显著。
    该县除了组织和动员一切可能抽调的城镇劳力支援农业以外，还注意使物资供应和资金投放密切结合；产品的成套生产和产品的修配密切结合；新式工具的推广和技术传授密切结合；并采取一竿子插到底的办法，把支援农业的东西直接送到农民手里。
    天长县在领导这一工作时，首先做好政治思想工作，使各部门职工牢固地树立为农业生产服务的思想。在县委第一书记领导下，工交、财贸和文教等单位负责人参加，组成了支援农业委员会，加强对各行业支援农业工作的统一领导。这个委员会根据当时农业生产的需要，及时研究和安排各行各业支援农业生产的工作。如商业部门购进了一部分胶轮车的内外胎、钢丝等零件，但缺乏夹头、车轴等配件。原来工业部门在生产计划中，没有安排这些胶轮车的配件生产任务。这个委员会在审查各部门的计划中，就指示工业部门补足制定了胶轮车的配件生产计划。会后，工业部门组织了十一个县、社工厂，在十天内就突击配套和安装好一千二百部胶轮车，并及时地在农业上发生了作用。又如工业部门为了支援农业，兴建了一座化肥厂，在今年头四个月内生产了五百多吨钙钾肥，但是由于不少农民不懂得怎样使用，有些公社缺乏购买化肥的资金，结果供应给公社的只有十多吨。根据这种情况委员会决定把工业、金融和科技部门的力量组织起来，尽力解决这一问题。科技部门组织了五十多个技术干部、印发了一千二百多份技术资料，向社员进行技术传授和宣传工作，使社员懂得了钙钾肥的增产作用和使用技术。银行也发放了六万二千多元贷款，帮助公社购买钙钾肥。这样，五百多吨钙钾肥，就全部供应给公社。同时，各部门还采取多种办法，加强部门间的协作，以做到协同作战。如工业、修配和科技部门，采用定期或临时联合召开会议和互相交换计划的办法，把新式工具的推广、修配和技术传授结合起来。修配部门根据新式工具推广的情况，在全县设立了八个修配站，并且经常派出技工到各地巡回修配，今年就帮助各公社修配了八万多件农具。科技部门在新式工具一出厂就进行技术传授工作，今年采用各种办法为公社培训了四百五十个技工，一千二百五十八个新式工具使用手。
    天长县各行业支援农业已经取得了很大成绩。今年上半年商业部门供应农村的生产资料，总额达六十一万多元，比去年同期增长近两倍。其中像深耕犁、改良耙、胶轮车等新式工具和化肥供应量增长更快。各行各业支援的这些生产资料，都切实地在农业生产上发挥了作用。最近根据有关部门调查，各人民公社今年添置和自制了九千九百五十二部深耕犁，五千八百九十部改良耙，三百二十三部风力水车，四十四台抽水机，这些农业机器可以正常使用的达95％到98％。今年银行贷给公社六十五万六千元贷款，90％以上的钱都用于生产上。
    本报南昌4日电　江西东乡县最近在全党全民中开展了查组织领导、查思想认识、查农业生产中薄弱环节的“三查”运动。通过这个运动，在全体干部中进一步树立了以农业为基础的思想，全县农业生产出现了一个一呼百应的新形势。
    中共东乡县委最近在全党全民中采取以虚带实、就实论虚、虚实并举的方法，从县委、公社党委、生产大队总支、生产队支部，到广大人民公社社员，财贸、工业、交通等部门，都根据以农业为基础的方针，开展了查组织领导、查思想认识、查农业生产中薄弱环节的
  “三查”运动。“三查”结果表明，在组织领导方面，县委和公社党委虽然狠抓了农业生产，但还有许多不足之处。主要的问题是：县委和公社党委还没有最大限度地把领导力量投入农业战线，还存在着分兵把口的现象，有时形成工农业不分轻重。工业部门有些干部在遇到劳力调配、机械动力分配等实际问题，就暴露出本位主义思想情绪。财贸系统支援农业生产成绩很大，但由于部分干部存在着“跟班”思想，对农业生产的支援还不够主动。
    东乡县根据“三查”中发现的问题，制定了加强组织领导、克服薄弱环节的各项重要措施。为加强对农业生产的组织领导，县委及县级机关实行了“三八”制，即以80％的县委委员、80％的时间、80％的机关干部，到农业生产最前线。县委从机关和工业、基建战线抽调了十名县委委员到公社担任实职。全县四十七名县委委员就有三十七名领导农业生产，使农业战线增加了三分之一的领导力量。县委还规定每个下到公社的县委委员，都要建立自己的生产基地，即抓好一片千亩千斤田，办好一个公共食堂，管好一个养猪场。县委第一书记首先带头下到最差的公社，抓了一片历来产量低的八百亩低产田。之后，各公社、大队、生产队干部，也都照样建立了自己生产基地。
    以农业为基础的认识的统一和农业组织领导的加强，使全县农业生产很快出现了一呼百应的新形势。有些地方发生旱象，工业部门就主动把十多部抽水机送给农业部门使用。全县各基建单位为保证农业生产有足够的劳动力，自动停办了许多计划外的建设工程，为农业生产让出了近万个劳动力。制糖等工厂为帮助农业解决夏收夏种中劳力不足困难，主动抽出十多辆汽车帮助运送种子、农具、肥料。工交部门借用农业部门的十多台拖拉机，已派专人送去。财贸部门为促进农业生产，除自动帮助农业部门调查夏收夏种耕牛、农具、生产资金缺少情况，并根据需要，及时发放了四十万元贷款，支援夏收夏种。
