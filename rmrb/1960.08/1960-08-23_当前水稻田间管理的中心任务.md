The Central Task of Current Rice Field Management
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Crop Cultivation and Physiology

Currently, middle-season rice has entered the ripening stage in all rice-producing areas of the country. Northern single-season rice has reached the heading and flowering stage; single-season late rice in the Yangtze River Basin has entered the late tillering stage; double-season late rice in the Yangtze River Basin and South China are, in some cases, recovering from transplant shock and will soon enter the tillering stage; this is a crucial period for striving for increased autumn grain production. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of commune members are throwing themselves into the intense battle of managing middle and late-season rice fields with soaring enthusiasm. Therefore, according to the specific requirements for cultivation conditions during the main growth stages of rice, promoting or controlling field management measures to achieve comprehensive yield increases is the central task on the rice production front at present.

Rice yield is composed of three factors: the number of panicles per mu, the number of grains per panicle, and the grain weight. To increase yield per unit area, in addition to selecting high-yielding varieties and various cultivation measures before transplanting, such as applying sufficient base fertilizer, cultivating strong seedlings, and rational close planting, it is also necessary to overcome the three key hurdles of more panicles, more grains, and heavier grains through correct field management after transplanting, so that these three factors that constitute rice yield can develop in a balanced manner. Among the field management measures for cultivating panicles and grains, controlling fertilizer and water is a very important and complex task. Fertilizer and water are indispensable conditions for rice growth, but improper application can also seriously affect rice growth. Therefore, management techniques must be flexibly mastered according to the different requirements of rice at different growth stages.

Cultivate strong seedlings, promote early tillering, control late tillering, and break through the panicle number barrier.

According to the summary of high-yield experience of middle and late-season rice in various regions in 1959, high-yield fields with a yield of over 1,000 catties per mu generally need to reach more than 250,000 to 300,000 panicles per mu. Therefore, this year's large-scale high-yield targets for northern single-season rice, single-season late rice and double-season late rice in the Yangtze River Basin, and double-season late rice in South China generally require breaking through 300,000 panicles. To obtain such a large number of panicles, it is first necessary to rely on the basic number of seedlings and transplanting strong seedlings. If the transplanted seedlings are not first-class seedlings, after transplanting and recovery, quick-acting, well-decomposed human manure or ammonium sulfate should be applied according to the fertility of the field to promote seedling growth, while maintaining shallow water to promote early tillering.

Under the condition of close planting with 200,000 to 250,000 seedlings per mu, as long as the base fertilizer is sufficient, it is not a problem for the number of tillers to reach more than 300,000 after transplanting and recovery. If fertilizer and water are sufficient and the initial temperature is high, the number of tillers can even surge to more than 400,000 or 500,000. However, whether 300,000 panicles can be obtained depends on whether the field management measures during the tillering period can keep up. To ensure that there are enough panicles per mu, the problem is not whether the number of tillers is sufficient, but how many tillers can form panicles. Practice has proven that to obtain a sufficient number of panicles, the principle should be to promote early tillering and control late tillering. When the number of tillers reaches the planned target, effective measures should be taken immediately, such as using sunning the field in high-fertility rice fields; using deep water irrigation in areas with low fertility and not too high temperatures during the tillering period, or a combination of the two methods, can prevent the number of tillers from increasing; at the same time, use drainage and irrigation to adjust the shape of the rice plants, ensure good light conditions between rows and plants, enhance existing tillers, and promote tiller-to-panicle formation, thereby increasing the effective tillering rate. Some high-yield fields, in order to prevent tillers from declining and dying, affecting the final number of panicles, apply more tillering fertilizer after recovery, resulting in a surge in the number of tillers and leaf area, early closure between rows and plants, which will inevitably lead to a large number of tillers dying due to not getting normal light conditions, and thus failing to guarantee a sufficient number of panicles. This not only consumes a large amount of organic nutrients in the body, but also because of early closure, the individual does not get a good ventilation and light environment, the stems are slender, the leaves are sparse, the root system is underdeveloped, and the heading is slow. Even if more tillers and panicles can be preserved, the panicles are small and have few grains, which will aggravate the threat of lodging. In this way, the gains in the number of panicles often cannot compensate for the losses in the number of grains, and the yield cannot be increased. Therefore, the main task of field management during the tillering period is not to rely on a large increase in the number of tillers to increase the number of panicles, but to promote the healthy growth of early tillers; not to prolong the tillering period, but to shorten the tillering period and control ineffective tillering in the later stage. Therefore, under the conditions of rational close planting and sufficient base fertilizer, tillering fertilizer can be applied less or not at all. If the base fertilizer is insufficient and the seedlings do not grow strong enough in the early stage, it is necessary to apply topdressing fertilizer early after recovery in combination with the first harrowing, or apply 10 to 20 catties of ammonium sulfate per mu after transplanting and apply an appropriate amount of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer on the surface of the field soil as "surface fertilizer", which has the effect of promoting recovery and early tillering. In short, the key to fertilization during the tillering period is to be able to master both avoiding the formation of third-class seedlings with short and narrow leaves and too small assimilation area due to lack of fertilizer and water, and avoiding early closure in the late tillering period, forming drooping leaves and delayed heading; and to achieve the point where the fertilizer runs out at the end of the tillering period, and a physiologically normal "yellowing" occurs, laying a solid foundation for attacking the grain number barrier later.

Observe the seedlings and apply topdressing fertilizer, combine with sunning the fields, master the laws of "yellow" and "black" changes in rice, regulate the carbon and nitrogen metabolism process, and break through the grain number barrier.

To achieve a large-scale high-yield target of over 1,000 catties per mu, it is also necessary to achieve an average of 70 to 80 or more grains per panicle on the basis of breaking through 300,000 panicles.

In close planting for increased production, the contradiction between the number of panicles and the number of grains is a specific manifestation of the contradiction between the group and the individual, and it is also an important problem existing in current production. To achieve high yields, the contradiction between the number of panicles and the number of grains must be unified, that is, there must be a large number of panicles, and each panicle must have a large number of grains. Practice has proven that as long as fertilizer, water, and other management measures are well mastered, this contradiction can be resolved.

After rice ends its light development stage, the plant transitions from vegetative growth to reproductive growth, that is, it begins its young panicle differentiation. In the entire process of rice panicle differentiation, the progress of the branch primordia formation period, which determines the number of grains per panicle, is very rapid. From the beginning of the first branch primordia to the end of the branch primordia formation period, it generally takes no more than three or four days. To strive for large panicles with many grains, it is necessary to create all the conditions necessary for the formation of large panicles before this period. For example, the application of panicle fertilizer must take effect during the branch primordia formation period to have the effect of increasing the number of grains per panicle. The panicle differentiation period has different manifestations due to the different maturity periods of the varieties. Generally, early rice begins young panicle differentiation before jointing, middle rice young panicle differentiation occurs approximately at the same time as jointing, and late rice occurs after jointing. If jointing is used as the basis for applying panicle fertilizer, the maturity characteristics of the variety must be considered and specifically mastered.

Plant organs are interconnected and mutually restrained. To obtain large panicles, well-growing vegetative organs are necessary. Under normal circumstances, the higher the dry matter weight per unit length of the vegetative body, the more vigorous the growth, the larger the panicle that will differentiate in the future, and the more grains per panicle. That is to say, large panicles must be formed on the basis of thick stems. To cultivate thick stems and large panicles, on the one hand, a sufficient supply of fertilizer and water is required; on the other hand, good light conditions between rows and plants are required to facilitate stem thickening and enhance its carbon assimilation process, laying a favorable foundation for the formation of large panicles. Chen Yongkang, a national rice production model, grasped the law of "three blacks and three yellows" in the three development and transformation periods of single-season late rice, observed the seedlings and applied topdressing fertilizer, and combined with sunning the fields to adjust the relationship between internal nutrition and physiology of the plants, which is a key measure to promote strong stems and large panicles. The key points of "three blacks and three yellows" are: The first "black" occurs during the tillering period and is controlled by applying fertilizer in the early tillering period, the so-called "minor heat tillering fertilizer"; at the end of the tillering period, the applied fertilizer runs out, combined with light sunning of the field, the first "yellow" appears; then apply the "major heat thickening fertilizer" before jointing, the leaf color turns green, which is the second "black"; combine with heavy sunning of the field before the beginning of autumn, the leaf color turns pale, forming the second "yellow"; after rewatering, apply the "beginning of autumn panicle growing fertilizer", the leaf color deepens again, which is the third "black"; until 3 to 5 days before heading, combined with light sunning of the field, the leaf color turns pale, and the third "yellow" appears. It has now been proven that this regular change has a certain universality, and the "black" and "yellow" change law exists in double-season late rice in the Yangtze River Basin and South China, as well as in northern single-season early and middle rice. Only because the growth period is shorter, generally only "two blacks" and "two yellows" appear, that is, it is necessary to "black" during the tillering period and panicle differentiation period, so that nitrogen metabolism is vigorous; the leaf color must turn "yellow" before panicle differentiation and before heading. The appearance of "yellow" is not only due to the change in internal nutritional status and the running out of the applied fertilizer, but also relies on sunning the field to master it. Sunning the field not only improves the soil environment, which is conducive to the development of new roots, but also oxidizes part of the ammoniacal nitrogen that is easily absorbed by the rice roots into nitrate nitrogen, and because the soil moisture is reduced, the absorption of nitrogen by the roots is weakened, so the physiological process dominated by nitrogen metabolism turns to the physiological process dominated by carbon metabolism, so that carbohydrates are concentrated in the stems, preventing excessive growth, and achieving the purpose of strengthening the stems. After rewatering, these carbohydrates are transferred to the panicles to supply the continuous need for organic nutrition during panicle grain development. Sunning the field is especially important for rice fields with excessive fertilization or poor drainage; however, it is not applicable to rice fields in saline-alkali areas because it is easy to cause alkali return, and the "dry-dry-wet-wet" drainage and irrigation method can be used instead.

Deep water at booting, shallow water at grain filling, moist for grain growth, control nitrogen fertilizer, prevent lodging, and break through the grain fullness and grain weight barrier.

There are two purposes for attacking the grain: First, topdressing during the booting stage is to increase the seed setting rate per panicle, and second, topdressing before and after heading is to increase the 1,000-grain weight. Under normal circumstances, when most spikelets in a panicle enter the pollen content filling period, spikelet degeneration often occurs. Therefore, topdressing during the meiotic division period of the mother cells before the pollen filling period, that is, approximately 12 to 13 days before heading, can reduce spikelet degeneration and increase the number of flowering and seed setting grains per panicle.

Research results have also proven that approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of the carbohydrates needed for grain filling rely on the green parts of the stems and leaves being synthesized and transferred after heading. Therefore, if fertilizer deficiency is manifested before the heading stage, grain fertilizer must be applied, or foliar topdressing must be carried out, such as spraying calcium nitrate or sprinkling thin urine water, which often has a yield-increasing effect.

Whether applying topdressing fertilizer during the booting stage or the heading stage, attention should be paid to the nutritional status of the plants and the performance of the leaf color, and it should not be applied blindly in large quantities. If the leaf color is still dark during the booting stage, it is absolutely not suitable to apply grain fertilizer, otherwise the plant will absorb too much nitrogen, which will consume a large amount of carbohydrates to form nitrogen compounds, greatly reducing the carbohydrates required by the panicles, and increasing the empty grain rate.

The continuous supply of water from the booting stage to the grain filling stage is also an important measure to increase the seed setting rate of the panicles and increase the grain weight. Especially if drought is encountered during the meiotic division period, it is most likely to cause poor pollen development and reduce the seed setting rate. The valuable experience of drainage and irrigation management in the later stage of growth proposed by the farmers of Jiangyin, Jiangsu, "deep water for booting, inch water for heading, thick water for grain filling, and moist for grain growth", is worth studying and promoting.

The fertilizer and water management measures in the later stage of rice growth are particularly important for double-season late rice in the Yangtze River Basin. Because the maturity period of double-season late rice in these areas is very likely to encounter cold damage. If there is too much fertilizer and water in the later stage, delaying maturity, the empty grain rate will increase due to cold damage, affecting the yield. However, in normal booting and heading periods, if a sudden cold wind strikes, deep water must be irrigated to keep warm.

The above are the three barriers to obtaining a rice harvest. These barriers must be continuously overcome in order to make the yield leap forward on the basis of the past. Therefore, from the time of transplanting and recovery until maturity, all field management work, especially fertilizer and water measures, must not be relaxed. They must be adjusted according to the laws of normal growth and development of rice and its specific requirements for fertilizer and water to play a role in promotion and control, so as to finally achieve the planned number of panicles, number of grains, and grain weight, and obtain the expected high yield.

Grasping fertilizer and water, attacking panicles and grains, are the main aspects of rice field management, but they are not all of its work. Other measures such as timely cultivation to enhance the absorption of fertilizer and water by the roots and promote early tillering; weeding to reduce the consumption of fertilizer and water and ensure healthy stem and tiller growth; preventing natural disasters such as drought, flooding, diseases, and insect pests to eliminate dead heart seedlings and white panicles, etc., all directly or indirectly promote tillering into panicles, increase the number of grains per panicle, and reduce the empty grain rate. All of this must be grasped in a timely manner throughout the entire growth period of rice, along with grasping fertilizer and water.

    当前水稻田间管理的中心任务
    中国农业科学院栽培生理研究所
    当前全国各稻区中稻已进入成熟阶段。北方单季稻已达孕穗和抽穗期；长江流域单季晚稻已进入分蘖后期；长江流域及华南的双季晚稻有的正在返青，不久即到分蘖期；这是争取秋粮增产的关键时期。广大社员群众在党的领导下，正以冲天干劲，投入中、晚稻田间管理的紧张战斗。因此，根据水稻的主要生育时期对栽培条件的具体要求，从田间管理措施上加以促进或控制，取得全面增产，是当前水稻生产战线上的中心任务。
    水稻产量是由每亩穗数、每穗粒数和粒重三个因子构成的。提高单位面积产量，除选用丰产品种和插秧前的各项栽培措施如施足基肥、培育壮秧、合理密植等以外，还必须通过插秧后的正确的田间管理，攻克穗多、粒多和粒重三个关口，使构成水稻产量的这三个因子得到平衡发展。在培育穗、粒的田间管理措施中，控制肥、水是非常重要而又十分复杂的工作。肥、水是水稻生长的不可缺少的条件，但施用不适当也会严重影响水稻生育。所以在管理技术上必须根据水稻不同生育期的不同要求，灵活掌握。
    培育壮秧，促进早期分蘖，控制后期分蘖，攻穗数关。
    根据1959年各地中、晚稻丰产经验总结资料，亩产千斤的丰产田一般每亩都要达到二十五万至三十万穗以上。因此，今年不论北方单季稻、长江流域的单季晚稻和双季晚稻以及华南的双季晚稻大面积丰产指标，普遍要求突破三十万穗。要得到这样多的穗数，首先要依靠基本苗数和插植健壮的秧苗。如果栽的不是一类秧苗，在插秧返青后必须根据大田的肥力情况，施用速效的腐熟人粪尿或硫酸铵等以促进苗的生长，同时保持浅水使之早发分蘖。
    在亩栽二十至二十五万苗的密植情况下，只要基肥不缺，插秧返青后，分蘖数达到三十万以上是不成问题的。如果肥、水充足，初期温度较高，分蘖数还可以猛增至四、五十万以上。但是能不能得到三十万穗，还要看分蘖期的田间管理措施是否能够跟上。保证每亩有足够的穗数，问题不在于分蘖数够不够，而在于有多少分蘖能够成穗。实践证明，要获得足够的穗数，应该以促进早期分蘖，控制后期分蘖为原则。当分蘖数达到计划指标后，立即采取有效措施，如在肥力高的稻田采用晒田；肥力较低，分蘖期温度不太高的地区采用灌深水，或两者相配合的办法，可以使分蘖不再增加；同时借排水、灌水以调整稻株的形相，保证行株间有良好的光照条件，增强已有的分蘖，并促使蘖蘖成穗，提高有效分蘖率。有的丰产田，为了怕分蘖衰退死亡，影响最后穗数，在返青后施用较多的分蘖肥，结果使分蘖数和叶面积激增，行株间过早郁闭，势必有大量的分蘖因得不到正常的光照条件而趋于死亡，反而不能保证足够的穗数。这样不仅徒耗体内大量的有机养分，而且因封行过早，个体得不到良好的通风透光环境，茎身纤细，叶片稀疏，根系发育不健全，出穗迟缓，即使能保存较多的分蘖和穗数，但是穗小粒少，且会加重倒伏的威胁。这样在穗数上的所得，往往不能补偿粒数上的损失，产量不能提高。所以分蘖期田间管理的主要任务，不是依靠大量加多分蘖数以期增加穗数，而是促进早期分蘖的健全生长；不是延长分蘖期，而是缩短分蘖期，控制后期的无效分蘖。因此，在合理密植和施足基肥的情况下，分蘖肥可以不施或少施，如果基肥不足，秧苗初期生长不够健壮，则需要在返青后结合第一次耘耥，提早追肥，或在插秧后亩施一、二十斤硫酸铵并配合适量的磷钾肥施在田土表层作“面肥”，这有促进返青，提早分蘖的效果。总之，分蘖期施肥的关键，在于能够掌握既不要因缺肥缺水而生成叶片短窄，同化面积过小的三类苗，又不要在分蘖后期过早封行，形成披叶郁闭和延迟出穗；并要做到在分蘖末期肥料落劲，出现生理上正常的退“黄”时，为以后攻粒数关打下牢固的基础。
    看苗追肥，结合晒田，掌握水稻“黄”“黑”变化规律，调节碳氮代谢过程，攻粒数关
    要达到亩产超千斤的大面积丰产指标，在突破三十万穗基础上还需要每穗平均达到七、八十粒或更多的粒数。
    在密植增产中，穗数与粒数的矛盾，是群体与个体矛盾的一种具体表现，也是当前生产上存在的重要问题。要取得高产，穗数与粒数的矛盾必须得到统一，即既有较多的穗数，又要每穗有较多的粒数。实践证明，只要肥、水和其他管理措施掌握得好，这一矛盾是可以得到解决的。
    水稻在结束其光照发育阶段后，植株由营养生长转入生殖生长，即开始其幼穗分化。在稻穗分化的整个过程中，决定每穗粒数的枝梗原基形成期的进展是很快的。由第一枝梗原基开始突起到枝梗原基形成期终止，一般不过三、四天。争取穗大粒多，就必须在这一时期以前创造形成大穗所必需的一切条件。例如，穗肥的施用，必须掌握在枝梗原基形成期发挥肥效，才有增加每穗粒数的效果。稻穗分化期因品种成熟期的不同而有不同的表现。一般早稻开始幼穗分化在拔节前，中稻幼穗分化约与拔节同时，晚稻则在拔节之后。如以拔节作为施用穗肥的根据，则必须考虑品种的熟期特性，具体掌握。
    植物器官与器官间是相互联系，相互制约的。为了获得大穗，必须有生长良好的营养器官。在一般情况下，营养体的单位长度的干物重愈高，表示生长愈健壮，将来分化的穗也愈大，每穗粒数愈多。也就是说，大穗必须在茎秆粗壮的基础上形成。培育粗秆大穗，一方面要求有足够的肥、水的供应；另一方面要求行株间有良好的光照条件，以利于茎秆长粗，并增强其碳素同化过程，为形成大穗打下有利基础。全国水稻丰产模范陈永康在单季晚稻三个发育转化时期，掌握“三黑三黄”的规律性变化，看苗追肥，并结合晒田，以调整植株内部营养生理的关系，是促进壮秆大穗的关键措施。“三黑三黄”的要点是：第一次“黑”发生在分蘖期，通过分蘖初期施肥，即所谓“小暑发棵肥”来控制；到分蘖末期，施用的肥分落劲，结合轻晒田，出现第一次“黄”；接着在拔节前施“大暑长粗肥”，叶色转绿，就是第二“黑”；结合立秋前重晒田，叶色一度转淡，形成第二“黄”；复水后施“立秋长穗肥”叶色再度转深，是为第三“黑”；直到抽穗前三至五天结合轻晒田，叶色转淡，出现第三“黄”。现在证明，这种规律性的变化是有一定的普遍性的，长江流域和华南的双季晚稻以及北方的单季早中稻都存在“黑”“黄”变化规律。只是由于生育期较短，一般只出现“二黑”“二黄”，即在分蘖期及穗分化期要“黑”，使氮代谢旺盛；在穗分化前及出穗前，叶色都要一度转“黄”。“黄”的出现，除由于内部营养状况的转变和所施的肥料落劲外，还要依靠晒田加以掌握。晒田不仅能改善土壤环境，有利新根发展，同时使稻根容易吸收的一部分氨态氮氧化为硝酸态氮，并由于土壤水分降低，根系对氮的吸收减弱，因而以氮代谢为主的生理过程转向以碳代谢为主的生理过程，使碳水化合物向茎秆集中，防止徒长，达到壮秆目的。复水以后，这些碳水化合物便向穗部转运，以供给穗粒发育时对有机营养的不断需要。晒田对施肥过多或排水不良的稻田特别重要；但对盐碱区稻田，因易引起反碱，不能适用，可采取“干干湿湿”的排灌方法来代替。
    深水孕穗，浅水灌浆，湿润长谷，控制氮肥，防止倒伏，攻粒饱粒重关。
    攻粒的目的有二：一、孕穗期追肥是为了提高每穗结实率，二、出穗前后追肥是为了增加千粒重。在一般情况下，当一穗多数颖花进入花粉内容充实期，常常发生颖花退化现象。因此，在花粉充实期前的母细胞减数分裂期，即大约在出穗前十二、三天时，进行追肥，可以减少颖花退化，增加每穗开花结实的粒数。
    研究结果还证明，谷粒充实所需要的碳水化合物，大约有三分之二至四分之三是依靠出穗后由茎叶的绿色部分合成转送的。因此在出穗期前，如表现缺肥，必须施用粒肥，或进行根外追肥，如喷过硝酸钙或泼稀薄尿水等，常有增产效果。
    不论孕穗期或出穗期施用追肥都应当注意植株的营养状况和叶色的表现，不可盲目大量施用。如孕穗期叶色仍浓，绝对不宜施粒肥，否则植株吸收过多的氮素，就要消耗大量碳水化合物，构成氮化合物，使穗部所需的醣类大大减少，增加空秕率。
    由孕穗期到灌浆期水的不断供应也是提高穗结实率和增加粒重的重要措施。特别在减数分裂期如遇到干旱，最易使花粉发育不良，结实率降低。江苏江阴农民提出的“深水做肚，寸水抽穗，厚水灌浆，湿润长粒”，是生育后期排灌管理的宝贵经验，值得研究推广。
    水稻生育后期的肥、水管理措施，对长江流域的双季晚稻尤有重要关系。因为这些地区双季晚稻的成熟期很容易遇到冷害，如果后期肥、水过多，延迟成熟，将会因冷害而增加空秕粒，影响产量。但在正常的孕穗、出穗时期，如突遇寒风侵袭，则须灌深水以便保温。
    以上是取得水稻丰收的三个关，必须连续攻克这些关口，才能使产量在过去的基础上跃进一步。因此，从插秧返青以后，直到成熟这一段期间，一切田间管理工作，特别是肥、水措施，绝对不能放松。必须根据水稻正常的生长和发育的规律及其对肥、水的具体要求，加以调整，起到促进和控制作用，才能最后达到计划中的穗数、粒数和粒重，获得预期的高产。
    抓肥抓水，攻穗攻粒，是水稻田间管理的主要方面，但还不是它的全部工作。其他措施如及时中耕以增强根系对肥、水的吸收和提早分蘖；除草以减少肥、水的消耗，健全茎蘖生长；防止旱、涝、病虫等自然灾害，以消灭枯心苗和白穗等，都直接间接地促进分蘖成穗，增加每穗粒数和减少空秕率。这一切都必需在水稻整个生育期中，与大抓肥、水的同时，及时掌握。
