Difficulty and Non-Difficulty
Harbin Peace Sugar Factory Worker Gao Guiying

Everything contains two mutually opposing aspects. If one aspect is lost, the other cannot exist. For example, without up, there is no down; without down, there is no up. Without the advanced, the backward cannot be distinguished; without the backward, the advanced cannot be distinguished. Without difficulty, smoothness cannot be highlighted; without smoothness, difficulty cannot be highlighted. In the past, I often only saw the difficult side of my work and not the smooth side. It was only after studying "On Contradiction" that I recognized this shortcoming.

Difficulty and non-difficulty are relative. In the process of the development of things, whether something is difficult or not depends on who it is for. The same thing is difficult for some people, but not difficult for others. For example, two years ago, shortly after I arrived at the electrical repair department, my master assigned me to repair a small electric drill. At the time, I was very afraid and felt it was difficult. I took it apart and looked for a long time but couldn't find the problem. Later, my master helped me find the problem. When repairing it, I worked for a full three hours and still couldn't fix it. My master took it and fixed it in less than five minutes. It can be seen that it is easy for those who have mastered the laws of things, but difficult for those who have not. To change the difficult to the non-difficult, we must seriously study and master the laws of things.

Chairman Mao taught us that contradictions can be transformed. Difficulty and non-difficulty can also be transformed. For those who dare to think and act, and are eager to learn, difficulty can be transformed into non-difficulty; but for those who lack drive and are arrogant, non-difficulty can be transformed into difficulty. The following example can also illustrate: When we started studying Chairman Mao's works, some people thought that theoretical study was a difficult task, especially when our group began to adopt the learning method of everyone being a teacher and everyone being a student. The first lecture was to be given by the five of us. Although we had attended several classes, when preparing the materials, we searched through materials and newspapers but couldn't grasp the central point, and we all felt that lecturing was really difficult. However, after a period of hard work, we now have a way of lecturing. It's not as anxious as it used to be. But some people, when they talk about something, it seems very easy, but when tested through practice, it is not as easy as they said. For example, some members of our group do more technical work in their usual work, and they learn more. When our group launched a production sports meet, the members actively practiced hard, but some who had learned a lot didn't practice hard, thinking they were sure to become pace-setters, but in the actual performance of the production sports meet, they fell behind. The pace-setter was actually the person who usually learned less but actively practiced.

Chairman Mao taught us rightly, despise difficulties strategically, and value difficulties tactically. That is to say, in our work, we must not be afraid of difficulties ideologically, we must dare to overcome difficulties, and we must not be intimidated by difficulties. But in specific practices, we must pay attention to difficulties and find ways to overcome them, because difficulties will not disappear by themselves. We must overcome them in order to make our work go smoothly, otherwise they will hinder the progress of our work.

### 难和不难

    难和不难	哈尔滨和平糖厂工人　高桂英
    在任何事物中都包含着互相对立的两个方面，失去一方面，另一方面也就不存在了。如没有上也就没有下，没有下也就没有上，没有先进的就显不出落后的，没有落后的也显不出先进的，没有困难也显不出顺利，没有顺利也显不出困难来。过去我在工作中往往是只看到困难的一面，而看不到顺利的一面，学习了《矛盾论》才认识到这个缺点。
    难和不难是相对的。在事物的发展过程中，一件事情难和不难，看是对谁而言，同一事物对于某些人是难的，对于另一些人就是不难。比如在二年前，我到电气修理部不久，师傅分配我检修一台小电钻，当时自己心里很怕，感到很难，卸开找了半天毛病也没找到，后来还是师傅帮助我把毛病找出来了。修理时，我又干了足足有三个小时，也没弄好，师傅拿过去不到五分钟就弄好了。可以看出，对于掌握了事物规律的人是容易的，而对于没有掌握它的规律的人就会感到困难。要变难为不难，就要认真学习和掌握事物的规律。
    毛主席告诉我们，矛盾是可以转化的。难和不难也是可以转化的。同一事物对于那些敢想敢干，虚心学习的人，难也可以变为不难；但对于缺乏干劲和有骄傲情绪的人，不难的也可以变为难。下面的例子还可以说明：在开始学习毛主席著作时，有些人认为理论学习是一件难事，特别是在我们小组开始采用人人当先生，人人当学生的学习方法时，第一讲是我们五个人来讲，虽然已经听过几次课了，但是在准备材料时，我们几个人东翻材料，西找报纸也抓不住中心，都感到讲课真难。可是，经过一个时期的努力学习，现在讲课时就有办法了。并不像从前那样着急了。而有些人，对一件事情说起来很容易，但通过实践一检验，就不像自己所说的那么容易了。如我们小组有的学员在平时的工作中，有的作技术活多一些，学的也就多一点；在我们小组开展生产运动会时，学员们都勤学苦钻地积极练兵，有些学得多的就不好好练兵，认为自己满有把握当上标兵，但在生产运动会的实际表演中却落后了。而标兵却被平时学得少而积极练兵的人当上了。
    毛主席教导我们的话对呀，在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难。也就是说，我们在工作中从思想上不要怕困难，要敢于战胜困难，不要被困难吓倒，但在具体做法上必须重视困难，想办法克服困难，因为困难是不会自消自灭的，必须去战胜它和克服它，才能使我们的工作顺利进行，否则它会妨碍我们的工作向前发展。
