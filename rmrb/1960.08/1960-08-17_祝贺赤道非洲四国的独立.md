    Congratulations on the Independence of the Four Countries of Equatorial Africa

    Following the declaration of independence by the four countries of French West Africa, Chad, the Central African Republic, Congo (Brazzaville), and Gabon in French Equatorial Africa have also successively declared their independence on August 11th, 13th, 15th, and today. The Chinese people express their heartfelt congratulations on the victory achieved by the people of Equatorial Africa in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism. On the eve of the independence of these countries, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Chen Yi sent telegrams to the leaders of the four countries respectively, expressing the sincere wishes of the 650 million Chinese people and announcing that the government of the People's Republic of China had decided to recognize the Republic of Chad, the Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, and the Republic of Gabon.

    In order to conceal their plunder, the colonialists claimed that their intrusion into Africa was to help Africans "develop" resources, and they also exaggerated the "great benefits" they brought to Africans. Indeed, from the first day that French colonialists invaded Equatorial Africa, they never relaxed their "development" of the rich resources of Equatorial Africa. However, the "development" in the mouths of the colonialists is actually plunder, and the people of Equatorial Africa will never forget the enormous disasters brought to them by the "development" of Western colonialists. In the construction of the 500-kilometer railway from Brazzaville, the capital of Congo (Brazzaville), to the Atlantic coast, not thousands or tens of thousands, but hundreds of thousands of Africans were tortured to death. And the population of Equatorial Africa plummeted from 15 million in 1900 to the current 4.89 million, entirely due to the colonialists' insatiable "development." French monopoly capitalists have seized countless profits through the so-called "development" of Equatorial Africa, while the lives of the people of Equatorial Africa have deteriorated, with many people only able to eat one meal a day, and an average of only one doctor for every 25,000 people. The infant mortality rate is over 50%. Through their own experiences, the people of Equatorial Africa fully understand that their "interests" lie in completely overthrowing colonial rule and achieving true national independence, while the so-called "development" and "assistance" flaunted by the colonialists can only bring profound disasters to the African people.

    Like the people of other African countries, the people of Equatorial Africa have never ceased their vigorous anti-colonial struggles for a long time in order to get rid of the shackles of colonialism. The French colonialists carried out brutal suppression of the people of Equatorial Africa, even burning thousands of innocent civilians alive, but the brutality of the colonialists could not subdue the heroic people of Equatorial Africa. At the end of the nineteenth century, the national heroes of Chad and Congo (Brazzaville), Rabah and Pongo, led tribal people in long and arduous battles in the hot jungles and mountains against the well-equipped French army, writing a moving page in the history of the people of Equatorial Africa's resistance to the enemy. Since then, the people of Equatorial African countries have launched armed resistance movements time and time again. Especially after the Second World War, with the vigorous upswing of the entire African national liberation movement, the struggle of the people of Equatorial African countries for national independence has developed rapidly.

    In order to prevent the development of the national independence struggles in French African colonies, the French colonialists once attempted to maintain their colonial rule in the form of so-called "autonomous republics" within the "French Community," while all important departments such as diplomacy, defense, finance, and strategic materials of the African member states within the "Community" were still controlled by the French colonialists. And the French colonialists even boasted that the "Community" was a "big family of free people." But look at what kind of "free family" this is. On June 18 last year, in an area of Chad, 206 people were killed by French colonialists. Thousands of Africans were arrested. Through the education of vivid facts, the people of French African countries, including the people of Equatorial Africa, increasingly realized that the sweet words of the colonialists cannot be believed. Therefore, within just over a year of the establishment of the "French Community," all the African member states in this "big family" have successively put forward demands for independence. Forced by the situation, the French colonialists had to agree that all countries in French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa would successively gain independent status within the "Community" this year. Obviously, the declaration of independence of these African countries is by no means a "gift" from the colonialists, but the result of the long-term hard work of the people of these countries, who have stepped into the breach one after another. The African people will never give up until they win complete independence.

    The Chinese people have always expressed deep sympathy for the heroic struggle of the people of Equatorial Africa against imperialism and colonialism. We are pleased to see that due to the unyielding persistence of the people of Equatorial Africa in their struggle, the dawn of freedom is rising in the jungles and oases of Equatorial Africa. We firmly believe that as the people of Equatorial African countries further adhere to the path of independent development, the artificial obstacles set up by the colonialists between the people of Equatorial Africa and the Chinese people will be gradually eliminated. The friendship between the Chinese people and the people of Equatorial African countries will surely develop day by day in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

### 祝贺赤道非洲四国的独立

    祝贺赤道非洲四国的独立
    继法属西非四国宣布独立之后，法属赤道非洲的乍得、中非共和国、（中央）刚果和加蓬也在8月11日、13日、15日和今天，陆续宣告独立了。中国人民对赤道非洲人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中所获得的胜利，表示衷心的祝贺。我国总理周恩来和外交部长陈毅已在这些国家独立的前夕分别致电四国的领导人，表达了六亿五千万中国人民的诚挚的祝愿，并宣布中华人民共和国政府已经决定承认乍得共和国、中非共和国、刚果共和国和加蓬共和国。
    殖民主义者为了掩饰自己的掠夺行为，说什么他们侵入非洲是为了帮助非洲人“开发”资源，并且还渲染他们给非洲人带来了“巨大利益”。不错，从法国殖民者侵入赤道非洲的第一天开始，他们从来没有放松过对赤道非洲的富饶资源的“开发”。但是，殖民者口中的“开发”实际上就是掠夺，赤道非洲人民永远不会忘记西方殖民者的“开发”给他们带来的巨大的灾祸。在修建（中央）刚果首府布拉柴维尔至大西洋沿海的总长五百公里的铁路中，不是几千或者几万，而是几十万非洲人被活活摧残致死。而赤道非洲的人口从1900年的一千五百万人急剧下降到现在的四百八十九万人，完全是由于殖民主义者贪得无厌地“开发”的结果。法国垄断资本家通过对赤道非洲的所谓“开发”，攫取了难以计数的利润，而赤道非洲人民的生活却每况愈下，很多人每天只能吃一餐饭，平均每两万五千人只有一个医生。儿童死亡率达到50％以上。赤道非洲人民通过切身的体验完全明白，他们的“利益”在于彻底推翻殖民主义的统治，实现真正的民族独立，而殖民主义者炫耀的所谓“开发”和“帮助”，只能给非洲人民带来深重的灾难。
    像非洲其他国家的人民一样，为了摆脱殖民主义的枷锁，赤道非洲人民长期以来始终没有停止过如火如荼的反殖民主义斗争。法国殖民者对赤道非洲人民进行了残酷的镇压，甚至用火活活烧死数以千计的无辜平民，但是，殖民者的残暴并不能使英勇的赤道非洲人民屈服。在十九世纪末叶，乍得和（中央）刚果的民族英雄拉巴赫、朋哥等人，曾经率领部落人民，在炎热的丛林和山区，同武装齐备的法国军队展开长期的艰苦的战斗，在赤道非洲人民的抗敌史上写下了可歌可泣的一页。此后，赤道非洲各国人民一次又一次地掀起过武装反抗运动。特别是第二次世界大战以后，随着整个非洲民族解放运动的蓬勃高涨，赤道非洲各国人民争取民族独立的斗争更有了迅速的发展。
    法国殖民者为了阻挡法属非洲殖民地民族独立斗争的发展，曾经妄图以“法兰西共同体”内的所谓“自治共和国”的这一形式，维护它的殖民统治，而“共同体”内非洲成员国的一切外交、国防、财经和战略物资等重要部门还是掌握在法国殖民者手里。而法国殖民者竟然吹嘘“共同体”是“自由人民的大家庭”。但请看这是什么样的“自由大家庭”吧。去年6月18日，在乍得一个地区，就有二百零六人遭到法国殖民者的杀害。数以千计的非洲人被逮捕。通过活生生事实的教育，法属非洲各国人民，包括赤道非洲人民在内，日益清楚地认识到，殖民主义者的花言巧语是不能相信的。因此，就在“法兰西共同体”成立不过一年多的时间内，这个“大家庭”内的所有非洲成员国都纷纷提出了独立的要求。法国殖民者迫于形势，不得不同意法属西非和法属赤道非洲的所有国家，在今年年内陆续获得在“共同体”内的独立地位。很显然，这些非洲国家的宣告独立，绝不是出自殖民主义者的“恩赐”，而是这些国家的人民前仆后继、长期艰苦奋斗的结果。非洲人民不赢得完全的独立，是决不会罢休的。
    中国人民一向对赤道非洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的英勇斗争表示深切的同情。我们高兴地看到，由于赤道非洲人民不屈不挠地坚持斗争，自由的曙光正在赤道非洲的丛林和绿洲上升起。我们深信，随着赤道非洲各国人民进一步坚持走向独立发展的道路，殖民主义者在赤道非洲人民和中国人民之间设置的人为的障碍，将会逐步地得到消除。中国人民和赤道非洲各国人民之间的友谊，必将在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同斗争中日益发展起来。
