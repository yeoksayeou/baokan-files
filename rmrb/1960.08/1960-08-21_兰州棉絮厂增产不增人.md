Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 19th - The Lanzhou Cotton Mill has self-manufactured equipment and innovated technology, achieving increased production without increasing manpower.

The factory's production task this year has doubled compared to last year. If the original tools were still used for production, it would require an additional 500 workers. Due to self-manufacturing equipment and carrying out technological revolution, the entire factory completed 84.6% of the annual plan in the first seven months of this year. Not only did it not increase manpower, but it also extracted more than ninety employees to study technology in other places or support fraternal units.

At the beginning of this year, when arranging the annual tasks, the factory proposed ten major innovation projects, and designated the cotton wadding and spinning processes, which were manual operations and accounted for the most labor, as the three key targets, determined to achieve increased production without increasing manpower. The workers added a bamboo curtain as a transmission belt to the seventeen rag-breaking machines in the rag-breaking section, which consumed a lot of labor and had low output, thus forming three linkage lines. As a result, the power was reduced from five machines to three, and the labor force was reduced from fourteen to two per shift, while the production efficiency was greatly improved. Up to now, the factory has modified and created a total of twenty-five machines in nine types, including cotton wadding machines, ear-tipping machines, and rag-breaking machines. These machines have increased work efficiency by one to twenty times respectively.

    兰州棉絮厂增产不增人
    新华社兰州19日电　兰州棉絮厂自造设备，革新技术，做到增产不增人。
    这个厂今年生产任务比去年增加一倍，如果仍用原有的工具进行生产，就需要增加五百名工人。他们由于自造设备，进行技术革命，全厂今年头七个月就完成了全年计划的84.6％，不但没增人，还抽出了九十多名职工到外地学习技术或支援兄弟单位。
    今年年初在安排全年任务时，厂里就提出了十大革新项目，并将其中手工操作、占劳力最多的棉絮、纺线等工序列为主攻的三大关键，决心实现增产不增人。工人们把占用劳力多产量低的破碎布工段的十七台破布机，增加了一条竹帘做传动带，这样就组成了三条联动线。结果动力由五台减为三台，劳力由每班十四人减为二人，而生产效率却大大提高。到目前为止，全厂共改制和创制棉絮机、倒穗机、破布机等九种共二十五台。这些机械分别提高工效一至二十倍。
