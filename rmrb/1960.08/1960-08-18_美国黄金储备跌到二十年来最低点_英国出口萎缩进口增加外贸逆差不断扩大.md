Xinhua News Agency, August 15th, Washington Dispatch: According to the "U.S. News & World Report" magazine published today, the gold reserves of the United States have fallen to their lowest point in more than twenty years.

    The magazine said: "The outflow of gold from the United States is increasing again. In July alone, 178.8 million U.S. dollars worth of gold was transferred from U.S. reserves to foreign treasuries. This is the largest reduction in U.S. gold reserves this year, and the fastest monthly outflow of gold since 1958 (when 2 billion U.S. dollars of gold flowed out of the United States)."

    The magazine pointed out that the current gold reserves of the United States are only 19.2 billion U.S. dollars, while the total amount of U.S. dollars owned by foreigners that can be exchanged for gold is 18.5 billion U.S. dollars. "In other words, the amount of gold that foreigners have the right to withdraw from the United States is almost equal to the amount of gold that the United States itself possesses."

    "U.S. News & World Report" magazine admitted that the massive outflow of gold from the United States is due to "trouble in foreign trade," and a large part of the gold outflow is "related to the U.S. foreign trade deficit." The magazine also said that the outflow of gold has caused concern among U.S. officials, who are worried about the prospects of the U.S. economy and the "stability of the dollar."

    Xinhua News Agency, London, August 16th: According to an announcement by the British Board of Trade on the 16th, British exports in the three months of May, June, and July this year decreased by 5% compared to the previous three months, while imports increased by 2.5%. According to figures released by the Board of Trade, the trade deficit was 64 million pounds in May, increased to 99 million pounds in June, and rose again to nearly 100 million pounds in July.

    美国黄金储备跌到二十年来最低点
    英国出口萎缩进口增加外贸逆差不断扩大
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：据今天出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志报道，美国的黄金储备已跌到二十多年来的最低点。
    这家杂志说：“美国的黄金外流又在增加。单单在7月份就有一亿七千八百万美元的黄金从美国的储备转移到外国的财库里去。这是今年来美国黄金储备的最大的一次减少，并且是1958年（当时有二十亿美元的黄金流出美国）以来黄金外流最快的一个月。”
    这家杂志指出，美国的黄金储备目前只有一百九十二亿美元，而外国拥有的可以提取黄金的美元数目一共为一百八十五亿美元。“换句话说，外国有权在美国提取的黄金，其数量差不多等于美国本身拥有的黄金数量”。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志承认，美国黄金大量外流是由于“对外贸易上的麻烦”，很大一部分黄金外流“同美国的对外贸易赤字有关”。这家杂志还说，黄金外流已引起美国官员的忧虑，他们对美国经济的前景和“美元的稳定”感到担心。
    据新华社伦敦电　据英国贸易部16日宣布，英国在今年5月、6月和7月三个月的出口比前三个月减少了5％，而进口却增加了2.5％。根据贸易部公布的数字，贸易逆差5月份是六千四百万英镑，6月份增加到九千九百万英镑，而7月份又上升到将近一亿英镑。
