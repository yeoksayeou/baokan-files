Guiyang, August 4th (Reported by our newspaper) The Party Committee of Guizhou No. 4 Construction Company, utilizing the method of concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles, completed a volume of work on the second phase of the Guizhou Cement Plant project in three months that was originally designed to take one and a half years. The project quality is good.

The second phase of the Guizhou Cement Plant project is divided into fourteen items. The Party Committee of Guizhou No. 4 Construction Company, which undertook this construction task, adopted the method of concentrating superior forces in stages and batches to fight annihilation battles in order to complete the construction task quickly, well, and economically; at the same time, it actively prepared for construction. In the construction work, the "three-way combination" meeting was organized, led by the Party Secretary, to go deep into the construction site. Aiming at the characteristics of the project, a construction plan was formulated, arranging the construction sequence of the fourteen individual projects. First, superior forces were concentrated to break through large-scale earthwork and foundation projects, then key projects such as the kiln head, kiln middle, and kiln tail were tackled, and then other projects and finishing works were completed individually. In the use of construction forces, the five construction sites under the company were appropriately reduced according to the degree of importance and urgency. More than 1,000 laborers, more than 20 large and medium-sized machines, and more than 100 cars and horse-drawn carts were drawn out to fully support key projects. The processing plants and building materials plants under the company also regarded serving key projects as their primary task. In this way, conditions were created for fighting annihilation battles from the determination of tasks to the organization of forces.

During the construction process, the Party Committee of the company, according to the plan, launched a large-scale rapid construction campaign for individual key projects. They successively organized large-scale earthwork projects and several large engineering battles such as the kiln middle, kiln tail, dust collector, and cement warehouse. In each battle, they organized assaults according to the several main links of the project. In the dust collector construction battle, because three battles were organized for foundation earthwork, foundation pouring, and formwork production and installation, the pouring of the frame structure was completed in twelve and a half days, greatly shortening the time compared to the original plan. In the construction process, the adoption of "five rankings" (namely, arranging the construction period, types of work, labor force, materials, and innovation projects) and the method of checking problems, checking key points, and checking weak links also played a positive role in ensuring the completion of the construction task on schedule.

The Party Committee of the company also used the gaps between the two battles to carry out "rest and reorganization," summarizing advanced construction experience to prepare for the next battle. For example, after the kiln tail workshop battle, the Party Committee of the company promptly mobilized workers to summarize advanced experiences such as continuous support of wood molds and parallel flow operations of the main body, and quickly promoted them in projects such as dust collectors and cement warehouses. The eight large cylinders of the cement warehouse required a large number of templates and scaffolding for construction, but because the employees learned from the experience of building the kiln tail plant, adopted sliding templates and used winches to transport materials, not only did they overcome the difficulty of lacking wood, but also shortened the construction period.

Because the Party Committee of the company concentrated its efforts on fighting annihilation battles in leading basic construction work, it completed the workload that was originally designed to take one and a half years in three months, saving more than 14,000 labor days, more than 120 tons of steel, more than 130 tons of cement, more than 1,800 cubic meters of wood, and reducing costs by about 23%.

    从确定任务到组织力量都为打歼灭战创造条件
    贵州建筑四公司进度快　用料省　用人少
    本报贵阳4日电　贵州省建筑四公司党委，运用集中力量打歼灭战的办法使贵州水泥厂二期工程建设，三个月完成了原设计需要一年半完成的工程量，工程质量良好。
    贵州水泥厂二期工程，共分十四个项目。承担这一建设任务的贵州省建筑四公司党委，为了多快好省地完成这项建设任务，采取集中优势兵力分期分批，打歼灭战的方法来进行建设；同时积极作好施工准备。在建设工作中，以党委书记为首，组织“三结合”会议，深入施工现场，针对工程特点，制订施工方案，将十四个单项工程安排出施工先后次序，首先集中优势力量突破大型的土石方工程和基础工程，再攻窑头、窑中、窑尾等关键工程，然后分头逐个完成其他项目和收尾工程。在施工力量的使用上，把公司所属的五个建筑工地，根据轻重缓急，加以适当缩减，抽出一千多劳力、二十多台大中型机械和一百多辆汽车、马车，全力支援重点工程。公司所属的加工厂、建筑材料厂等，也把为重点工程服务作为首要任务。这样，从确定任务到组织力量，都为打歼灭战创造了条件。
    在施工过程中，公司党委根据规划，大搞单项重点工程快速施工战役。他们先后组织了大型土石方工程和窑中、窑尾、收尘器、水泥库等几个大工程战役。在每个战役中，又按工程的几个主要环节，组织突击。在收尘器施工战役中，由于组织了基础土石方、基础浇灌、模板制作安装三个战斗，使框架结构的浇灌十二天半就完成了，比原计划的时间大大缩短。在施工过程中，采取“五排”（即排工期、工种、劳力、材料、革新项目）和查问题、查关键、查薄弱环节的方法，对保证按期完成施工任务，也起了积极作用。
    公司党委还利用两次战役的空隙进行“休整”，总结先进施工经验，为下次战役作好准备。如在窑尾厂房战役之后，公司党委及时发动工人总结了连续支木模、主体交叉平行流水作业等先进经验，很快就在收尘器、水泥库等工程中推广使用。水泥库的八个大圆筒，需要大量模板和脚手架才能施工，但由于职工们吸取修建窑尾厂的经验，采用滑动模板和用卷扬机运料等方法，不仅克服了缺乏木料的困难，而且缩短了工期。
    由于公司党委在领导基本建设工作中集中力量打歼灭战，三个月就完成了原设计要一年半才能完成的工作量，节约了劳动日一万四千多个、钢材一百二十多吨、水泥一百三十多吨、木材一千八百多立方米，降低成本23％左右。
