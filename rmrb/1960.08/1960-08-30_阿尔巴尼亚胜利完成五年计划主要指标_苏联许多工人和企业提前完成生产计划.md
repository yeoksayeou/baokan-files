Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 27th: The Albanian Telegraph Agency reported on the 26th that Albania has victoriously completed the main economic targets of the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960).

	The industrial products targets were completed one year ahead of schedule. This year's planned output value will increase by 115% compared with 1955.

	The collectivization of agriculture has also been largely completed. Last year's total agricultural output value was almost twice that of 1938 before liberation.

	During the Second Five-Year Plan period, more than 500 important industrial projects and socio-cultural facilities have been built nationwide. The construction work stipulated in the Five-Year Plan has been completed ahead of schedule and is expected to exceed the Five-Year Plan by 36%.

	In the first four years of the Second Five-Year Plan, the state's investment in the construction of the above projects reached more than 35.3 billion lek, which is 10 billion lek more than the total investment of the First Five-Year Plan.

	The Albanian Telegraph Agency also said that the industrial products produced by Albanian workers in half a month and the amount of work completed by construction workers in nine days are equal to the total industrial output and construction workload in the entire year of 1938.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 21st: According to Soviet newspapers: Many Soviet workers, labor collectives, and enterprises, and even some economic regions, have victoriously gained time and reached the production level and labor productivity level originally planned for 1961, 1962, 1963, and even 1965 of the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) ahead of schedule.

	Soviet coal miners and metallurgical workers have always been at the forefront of the socialist labor competition to complete the Seven-Year Plan. Coal miners in various regions have created many high production records over the past year, exceeding the state's coal production by a large amount. The miners of Vorkuta, the Soviet Union's fourth largest coal mining industrial base, have been overfulfilling their coal mining quotas every day since the beginning of this year. In Mine No. 29, led by Communist Party member Usovich, the work team often exceeds the quota by 75% to 80% to complete the coal mining plan. Since the beginning of this year, the miners of Mine No. 40 have exceeded the state's coal production by approximately 80,000 tons, and their coal production reached the original target for 1965 in mid-July. In the Soviet Union's famous Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Combine, four communist labor teams led by Zashlyaping and Obraztsov produced more than 7,000 tons of steel for the state in the first five months of this year (equal to twice the amount of steel produced above the plan for the whole year last year), creating an unprecedented high labor productivity record in the plant. Now, the economic and technical indicators of these labor collectives are very close to the original level planned for 1965. The metallurgical workers in the East Kazakhstan economic region have also victoriously gained time, and they have now overfulfilled the seven-year production plan for the important metal cadmium by more than five years ahead of schedule.

	In the petroleum, machine manufacturing, electric power, and other industrial sectors, workers, labor collectives, and enterprises that are far ahead of schedule are also constantly emerging. For example, the employees of the No. 3 Bureau of the "Almetyevsk Oil Drilling" Trust of the Tatar Oil Field have worked hard to innovate production technology and tap potential in various ways to achieve production automation over the past year. Now, they have raised their economic and technical indicators to the original level planned for 1964, and the average monthly drilling speed has reached the original target for 1965. Some oil drilling teams are now completing the original production tasks for 1961. In the Penza economic region, chemical and textile machinery manufacturing workers are now doing the work originally scheduled for two and five years later in the Seven-Year Plan. By the end of this year, they will be able to increase the production of chemical industry equipment to at least the original level planned for 1963, and exceed the original target for 1965 in textile machinery output. In terms of the electric power industry, the Karakum "Friendship of Peoples" Hydropower Station, one of the largest hydropower stations in Central Asia, produced 14.45 million kilowatt-hours of electricity for the country last year and the first two months of this year alone. Now, its power generation has far exceeded the original level planned for 1965 in the Seven-Year Plan.

	Many textile workers in various parts of the Soviet Union are learning from the example of the famous female textile worker Vecherova, striving to greatly advance the productivity of the looms they manage to the level of 1965. Now, nearly 12,000 textile workers and several textile factories in the Ivanovo economic region have improved the productivity of their equipment to the original level planned for 1965 due to technological innovation and increased labor proficiency. The total output of the textile industry in the Vladimir economic region reached the original level planned for 1962 in early August. The Lakna Textile Factory here originally strove to complete the seven-year plan to increase labor productivity in five years, but they completed this plan ahead of schedule in one year and seven months.

    阿尔巴尼亚胜利完成五年计划主要指标
    苏联许多工人和企业提前完成生产计划
    新华社地拉那27日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社26日报道，阿尔巴尼亚已经胜利完成了第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）的主要经济指标。
    工业品的指标已经提前一年完成。今年的计划产值将比1955年增加115％。
    农业的集体化大体上也已经完成。去年的农业总产值几乎为解放前1938年的两倍。
    在第二个五年计划期间，全国已经建成了五百多项重要的工业项目和社会文化设施。五年计划所规定的建筑工作已提前完成，预料将超额36％完成五年计划。
    在第二个五年计划的头四年中，国家用于建设上述项目的投资达三百五十三亿多里克，比第一个五年计划的投资总额多一百亿里克。
    阿尔巴尼亚通讯社又说，目前阿尔巴尼亚的工人每半个月所生产的工业品、建筑工人每九天所完成的工作量，就等于1938年全年的工业产量和建筑工作量。
    新华社莫斯科21日电　据苏联报纸报道：苏联有许多工人、劳动集体和企业以至一些经济区，已经胜利地赢得了时间，提前达到了七年计划（1959—1965）原定的1961、1962、1963年甚至1965年的生产水平和劳动生产率水平。
    苏联采煤工人和冶金工人在争取完成七年计划的社会主义劳动竞赛中一直走在最前列。各地煤矿工人一年多来创造了许多高生产纪录，超额为国家开采了大量的煤。苏联第四个煤矿工业基地佛尔库塔的矿工今年以来天天都超计划完成采煤定额。在这里的第二十九号矿井中，由共产党员乌索维奇领导的工作队甚至常常超过定额75％至80％完成采煤计划。四十号矿井的矿工今年以来已经超计划为国家开采了约八万吨煤，他们的采煤量在7月中旬已经达到原定1965年的产量指标。在苏联著名的下塔吉尔钢铁联合工厂，由扎什梁平、奥布拉佐夫等人领导的四个共产主义劳动队在今年头五个月中就为国家超计划炼出了七千多吨钢（等于去年全年超计划生产的钢的二倍），创造了该厂空前高的劳动生产率纪录。现在，这些劳动集体的经济技术指标已经十分接近原定1965年的水平。东哈萨克经济区的冶金工人也胜利地赢得了时间，他们现在已经提前五年多超额完成了重要金属镉的七年生产计划。
    在石油、机器制造、电力等工业部门中，也不断涌现出远远走在时间前面的工人、劳动集体和企业。例如，鞑靼油田“阿尔米季耶夫石油钻探”托辣斯第三局的职工，一年多来努力革新了生产技术，多方挖掘潜力实现了生产自动化。现在，他们已经把经济技术指标提高到原定1964年的水平，使月平均钻探速度达到原定1965年的指标。有的石油钻探队现在已经在完成原定1961年的生产任务。在奔萨经济区，化学和纺织工业机器制造工人们现在已在作七年计划原订二年后和五年后的工作。到今年年底，他们就可以使化学工业装备的生产最少达到原定1963年的水平，使纺织机产量超额原定1965年的水平。在电力工业方面，中亚细亚最大水电站之一的卡拉库姆“各族人民友谊”水电站单在去年和今年头二个月就为国家多生产了一千四百五十万度电。现在，它的发电量已经远远超过七年计划原定1965年的水平。
    苏联各地许多纺织工人都在学习著名纺织女工维切洛娃的榜样，争取使自己所管理的车床的生产率大大提前达到1965年的水平。现在，伊凡诺佛经济区有将近一万二千纺织工人和好几个纺织工厂由于进行技术革新和提高劳动熟练程度，已经把设备的生产率提高到原订1965年的水平。弗拉季米尔经济区的纺织工业总产量，在8月初已达到了原定1962年的水平。这里的拉克娜纺织工厂原来争取在五年内完成提高劳动生产率的七年计划，可是，在一年零七个月中他们就提前完成了这个计划。
