Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th. Xinxiang City, Henan Province, vigorously supports the technical transformation of Jiulishan Iron Mine in various industries, which immediately takes effect. In late July, the ore output of this mining plant increased by 48.8% compared with the same period last month. The ore grade was above 70%, and the ore transportation volume also doubled.

In early July, the Xinxiang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China transferred 1,600 workers, 49 cadres, and a large number of equipment from factories, mines, enterprises, government agencies, and schools throughout the city. Led by Zhang Subin, the first secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, they went to the mountains to support the technical transformation of Jiulishan Iron Mine. The Xinxiang Municipal Party Committee held a meeting in the mine with the participation of the party committee secretaries, factory directors, and technicians of the city's major machinery factories to support the technical transformation of the mine. The meeting allocated more than 60 pieces of mining equipment such as hoists, mine cars, car climbers, and hand drills. All factories placed the urgent production of machinery and equipment for the mine in a primary position. When Xinxiang Light Industrial Machinery Factory rushed to produce ten hoists for the mine, it actively and proactively overcame difficulties in materials, technology, and equipment, and completed the task six days ahead of schedule. In the past half month, the machinery factories have produced more than 30 pieces of large equipment such as mine cars for the mine. The Municipal Transportation Bureau also dispatched a group of veteran car repair technicians to the mountain to help the mining plant establish a maintenance team in the mining area, achieving "minor repairs not returning to the team, medium repairs not returning to the city." Now the vehicle operation rate of the entire mine has increased from 60% to 80%, and the daily ore transportation has increased from the original 500 tons to 900 tons.

Employees of the Xinxiang City Commercial Department also delivered goods to the mountains, giving priority to supplying the mine with a large number of industrial materials such as lighting equipment and mining tools, as well as daily necessities. The service industry transferred the best technicians to the mountains, and set up service points for hairdressing, shoe repair, tailoring, washing and dyeing. The health department also transferred health care personnel to help the mine improve its medical organization, and built a comprehensive hospital with 20 beds. Medical stations were set up in various work areas to ensure that general diseases could be treated and simple operations could be performed without going down the mountain.
