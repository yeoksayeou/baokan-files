Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 20th August: The broad masses of workers and staff in Jiangxi Province's iron and steel industrial enterprises have vigorously engaged in technical innovation and revolution, using low-quality coal to make good coke, and more than thirty iron smelting plants have used anthracite to smelt pig iron. This has enabled the province's iron and steel enterprises to break through the major key of fuel supply, ensuring the sustained leap forward in steel production.

Jiangxi Province's iron and steel production capacity has increased significantly in the first seven months of this year. In order to provide more fuel to iron and steel enterprises, party committees at all levels throughout the province, while taking measures to vigorously increase coal production and open up a large number of small coal mines, also led the workers and staff of iron and steel industrial enterprises in a vigorous technical revolution to attack the fuel barrier. Iron and steel workers in various places put forward the bold slogan: "Fuel must race with steel, ensuring that blast furnaces can't get enough to eat." The Fengcheng Iron and Steel Plant used the low-quality coal produced in the county to experiment with coke production. After more than a month of dozens of experiments, based on the characteristics of low-quality coal such as low volatile content, heavy ash content, and poor spontaneous combustion, they improved the flue of the coking oven, enhanced the firepower, eliminated combustion dead spots, and boldly innovated the fire-watching operation. Finally, they produced good coke that met the requirements of smelting, ensuring the needs of blast furnace ironmaking. After the Anfu Iron and Steel Plant used the locally produced low-quality coal to make coke, the sulfur content in the coke was initially relatively high. The workers and staff of the entire plant continued to vigorously engage in innovation, creating a "one-stop desulfurization" method from coal washing and coking to iron tapping. They changed the number of times of washing raw coal from once to three times, reducing the sulfur content of coal from 4% to 3%. During coking, they used rice husks, salt, yellow mud, and other materials for desulfurization, reducing the sulfur content of coke to below 1.5%, thus effectively ensuring the quality of pig iron. Iron and steel workers in various places also experimented with using anthracite directly into the furnace for ironmaking. At present, more than thirty iron and steel enterprises have achieved significant results in using anthracite for ironmaking. When the workers and staff of the Yingtan Iron and Steel Plant were experimenting with anthracite ironmaking, they transformed the hot blast stove, increased the furnace temperature, and innovated the charging and slagging operations, achieving frequent slagging and multiple batches of charging. As a result, all the pig iron produced was high-quality foundry iron. The workers and staff of the Xinfeng Iron and Steel Plant put forward more than 1,000 rationalization proposals in order to experiment with anthracite ironmaking. They repeatedly persisted in experimenting twenty-eight times in more than two months, overcoming numerous difficulties, and finally explored a set of methods for anthracite ironmaking, producing high-quality iron. The cost of pig iron in the entire plant was also greatly reduced.

In order to save coal, iron and steel workers in various places also used waste coal slag, coal powder, and waste coal gas to make iron. After the Dongxiang Iron and Steel Plant broke the argument among the workers that "broken coke cannot be used for coking again," the coking workers mixed 30% of broken coke into the fine coal to produce good coke, so that all 1,500 tons of broken coke in the entire plant were used for coking. After achieving success in broken coke coking, the workers further experimented with mixing 20% of mineral powder into fine coal for coking. The experimental results showed that the coking rate was above 70%, and the sulfur content of coke was 0.6%, which fully utilized more than 1,000 tons of mineral powder in the entire plant and saved a large amount of fine coal. In addition, new technologies and methods for saving coal and coke, such as recoking raw coke, have also been widely promoted in various iron and steel plants.

    江西用劣质煤炼好焦、用无烟煤炼生铁
    燃料充足　钢铁增产
    新华社南昌20日电　江西省钢铁工业企业的广大职工，大搞技术革新和技术革命，用劣质煤炼成了好焦，并有三十多个炼铁厂用无烟煤炼出了生铁，从而使全省钢铁企业突破了燃料供应这一重大关键，保证了钢铁生产持续跃进。
    江西省今年前七个月钢铁生产能力大大增加。为了给钢铁企业提供更多的燃料，全省各级党委在采取措施大抓煤炭增产和增开大量小煤窑的同时，还领导钢铁工业企业的职工大闹技术革命，猛攻燃料关。各地钢铁职工提出了“燃料要和钢铁赛跑，保证高炉吃不了”的豪迈口号。丰城钢铁厂采用本县所产的劣质煤试验炼焦。经过一个多月的数十次试验，根据劣质煤挥发分低、灰粉重、自燃差等特点，改进了炼焦窑的火道，增强了火力，消灭了燃烧死角，并大胆革新了看火操作，终于炼出了合乎冶炼要求的好焦，保证了高炉炼铁的需要。安福钢铁厂在用本地区产的劣质煤炼焦后，开始时焦中含硫量比较高，全厂职工又继续大闹革新，创造出从洗煤、炼焦直到出铁的“一条龙脱硫”的方法。他们把洗原煤的次数由一次改为三次，使煤的含硫量从4％降到3％；炼焦时又用稻谷壳、食盐、黄泥等进行脱硫，使焦炭的含硫量降到1.5％以下，因此有效地保证了生铁质量。各地钢铁职工还试验用无烟煤直接入炉炼铁。目前，己有三十多个钢铁企业采用无烟煤炼铁获得显著效果。鹰潭钢铁厂职工在试验无烟煤炼铁时，改造了热风炉，提高了炉温，并革新了下料和出渣操作，做到勤出渣，多批下料。结果，炼出的生铁全部是优质的铸造铁。信丰钢铁厂的职工为了试验无烟煤炼铁，提出了合理化建议一千多条。他们在两个多月中反复坚持试验了二十八次，克服了重重困难，终于摸索出无烟煤炼铁的一套办法，炼出了优质铁，全厂生铁成本也随之大大降低。
    为了节约用煤，各地钢铁职工还利用废煤渣、煤粉和废煤气炼铁。东乡钢铁厂在职工中破除“碎焦不能再炼焦”的论调后，焦化工人们在精煤中掺用30％的碎焦炼出了好焦，使全厂一千五百多吨碎焦全部被利用炼焦了。在碎焦炼焦取得了成就后，职工们又进一步试验精煤中掺用20%的矿粉炼焦。试验结果，结焦率在70％以上，焦炭的含硫里为0.6％，使全厂一千多吨矿粉得到充分的利用，节约了大批的精煤。此外，生焦重炼等节约煤焦的新技术、新办法，也在各钢铁厂普遍推广。
