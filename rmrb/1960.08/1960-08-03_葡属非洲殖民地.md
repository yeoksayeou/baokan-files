    Portuguese African colonies include Angola, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, and six islands. The total population is approximately 11 million, and the total area is approximately 2 million square kilometers, equivalent to more than 20 times the size of Portugal itself. Among them, Angola has an area of over 1.2 million square kilometers, equivalent to 13 times the size of Portugal, with a population of approximately 4.3 million. Mozambique has an area of over 780,000 square kilometers and a population of over 6.2 million. These two regions constitute the core of Portugal's colonies in Africa. Portuguese Guinea has an area of over 36,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 600,000.
    Portuguese African colonies possess abundant mineral and agricultural resources. However, whether in Angola or Mozambique, there is almost no industry; all mineral and agricultural resources are objects of plunder by imperialists such as Portugal, the United States, Britain, and Belgium.
    For five hundred years, Portuguese colonialists have established the most barbaric and bloody system of national oppression in these colonies. Slave labor is rampant. Throughout Portuguese Africa, 700,000 Africans have been seized for forced labor. In Angola alone, 380,000 people have been seized and sent to colonialist mines and plantations, or to South African mines to engage in slave labor. Colonialists annually transport 100,000 slave laborers from Mozambique to South African mines, deriving huge revenues from this. At the same time, Portuguese colonialists also adopt the so-called "assimilation" policy, implementing extremely cruel racial discrimination and oppression.
    Portuguese African colonies have always been called "silent" areas, but in recent years, the people of these regions have also launched struggles against colonialism and for national independence. In Angola, according to American newspapers, guerrilla forces numbering approximately 2,000 have emerged to resist the Portuguese colonialists. In Portuguese Guinea, there were strikes by sailors and dockworkers last year and early this year. Portuguese colonialists have conducted frantic searches and bloody suppression of the people of Portuguese African colonies. In August 1959, more than 50 people were massacred in the Bissau region of Portuguese Guinea alone. Currently, more than 50 Angolan patriots are being secretly tried in Portuguese colonial military courts. However, the people of Portuguese African colonies have not yielded; they are persisting in a difficult and heroic struggle against the Portuguese colonialists.

    葡属非洲殖民地
    葡属非洲殖民地包括安哥拉、莫三鼻给、葡属几内亚和六个岛屿。总人口约一千一百万，总面积约二百万平方公里；相当于葡萄牙本土二十几倍。其中安哥拉面积为一百二十多万平方公里，相当于葡萄牙本土十三倍，人口约四百三十多万，莫三鼻给面积为七十八万多平方公里，人口六百二十多万。这两个地区构成了葡萄牙在非洲殖民地的核心。葡属几内亚面积为三万六千多平方公里，人口约六十万。
    葡萄牙非洲殖民地有着丰富的矿产资源和农业资源。但无论安哥拉或莫三鼻给，都几乎没有什么工业，所有的矿产和农业资源，都是葡、美、英、比等帝国主义掠夺的对象。
    五百年来，葡萄牙殖民者在这些殖民地建立了世界上最野蛮、最血腥的民族压迫制度。奴隶劳动盛行。整个葡属非洲殖民地有七十万非洲人被抓去进行强迫劳动。在安哥拉就有三十八万人被抓到殖民者的矿山和种植园，或被送到南非的矿井中去从事奴隶劳动。殖民者每年从莫三鼻给向南非矿井输送十万名奴隶劳工，从中取得巨额的收入，同时，葡萄牙殖民者还采取所谓“同化”政策，实行极端残酷的种族歧视和压迫。
    葡属非洲殖民地一向被称为“沉默”地区，但是，近年以来，这些地区的人民也掀起了反抗殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争。在安哥拉，据美国报刊透露，已经出现了人数约二千人的反抗葡萄牙殖民者的游击武装。葡属几内亚在去年和今年初都爆发了海员及港口工人的罢工。葡萄牙殖民者对葡属非洲殖民地人民进行了疯狂搜捕和血腥镇压。1959年8月仅仅在葡属几内亚比绍地方就有五十多人被屠杀。目前，有五十多个安哥拉的爱国人士，正在葡萄牙殖民者的军事法庭上秘密受审，但是，葡属非洲殖民地人民并没有屈服，他们正在坚持着反抗葡萄牙殖民者的艰巨而英勇的斗争。
