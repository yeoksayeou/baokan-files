　　Some areas in the South have had a bumper harvest of early rice. Consequently, a "Don't Forget to Save After a Bumper Harvest" campaign has emerged in these areas.

　　The more bountiful the harvest, the more we should emphasize conservation. The principle is similar to how, the more success we achieve, the more humble, prudent, and hardworking we should be. Because victory brings joy to people, it also often makes some shortsighted people relax their fighting spirit and slow down. After a good harvest, don't forget to save; after smooth sailing, don't forget the hard work. Never forgetting the factors that contributed to our achievements is the true color of a revolutionary, and only in this way can we always maintain the driving force for progress.

　　There is an old saying: "Always think of days of scarcity when you have plenty, and don't wait until you have nothing to think of having something." Doesn't this also tell people to use abundance to compensate for scarcity, look ahead and behind, and carry forward the spirit of hard struggle?

　　In fact, "Don't forget to save" should not only be remembered during a bumper harvest, but at all times.
                          ＊＊＊
　　The saying "Do not do small evils, and do not neglect small good deeds" is very true.

　　The Jinlong Brigade of the Jinxing Commune in Changde County, Hunan, threshed and collected meticulously, ensuring that every grain returned to the granary. After harvesting the rice paddies, they collected five ears of grain from within one square meter. This number may seem insignificant, but they calculated that one mu of land could yield an additional one or twenty jin of rice, and one hundred mu of land could yield an additional one or two thousand jin. With this calculation, a small matter became a big matter.

　　Keeping the big picture in mind while starting with the small things, every bit of saving is valuable. "Grains of beans gather into baskets, drops of water converge into rivers." Without the small, there would be no big. If you don't do something because it's small, where does the big come from? Ignoring small things often leads to losing big things because of small things. Isn't this principle very obvious?

    南方有些地区早稻丰收。于是，紧接着在这些地区出现了一个“丰收不忘节约”的运动。
    越是丰收，越要讲节约。道理就像是越有成绩，越要谦虚谨慎、埋头苦干一样。因为，胜利给人们带来喜悦，但也常常使一些眼光短浅的人松懈斗志、缓步不前。丰收了，不忘节约；顺利了，不忘艰苦。对于取得成绩的因素，念念不忘，不失革命者的本色，这才能永远保持前进的动力。
    有句古话说：“常将有日思无日，莫待无时思有时”。这不也正是告诉人们要以丰补歉，瞻前顾后，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神吗？
    其实，“不忘节约”，不只是在丰收的时候，在任何时候都不应该忘记。
                          ＊＊＊
    “勿以善小而不为，勿以恶小而为之”这句话，说得很对。
    湖南常德县金星公社金龙大队细打细收，颗粒归仓，他们在收割完了的稻田里，一平方米之内捡回了五支谷穗。这数字似乎微不足道，但他们算了一笔账：一亩田可收回稻谷一、二十斤，百亩田可收回一、二千斤。这一算，小事情变成大事情了。
    大处着眼，小处着手，一点一滴的节约都可贵。“粒豆聚成箩，滴水汇成河”。没有小，也不会有大。因小而不为，大从何来？忽视小事情，常常会因小而失大。这道理不是很明显吗？
