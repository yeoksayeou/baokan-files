Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: While the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is colluding to suppress the Congolese people's anti-colonialist struggle, intense infighting is also unfolding within this bloc over the contest for Congo's richest province, Katanga. The United States is actively plotting to send United Nations troops into Katanga Province to replace the Belgian invaders, while the Belgian government is desperately resisting this plan, determined to keep Katanga under the occupation of substantial Belgian forces.

According to the latest news, the United Nations forces' plan announced by United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on August 6th to enter Katanga, which received the approval of the U.S. State Department, has been temporarily suspended. Hammarskjöld announced on the 5th that he had requested the United Nations Security Council to meet and discuss the issue of United Nations troops entering Katanga.

Hammarskjöld announced his postponement plan after the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General, the American national Bunch, went to Katanga Province to conduct activities, and after the Belgian side repeatedly expressed opposition to the United Nations forces going to Katanga. Prior to this, Hammarskjöld himself had been in Léopoldville recently, carrying out intense activities on this matter.

The U.S. State Department had expressed open satisfaction with Hammarskjöld's plan, with U.S. State Department spokesman White praising Hammarskjöld's activities for creating "hopeful signs" in the Katanga situation.

However, this American plan to replace Belgian invading forces with United Nations forces has been resolutely opposed by the Belgian government. After Hammarskjöld announced the decision that United Nations forces would enter Katanga Province, Belgian Prime Minister Eyskens delivered a speech on the 3rd, expressing opposition to United Nations interference in Katanga's so-called "internal affairs." Eyskens reiterated on the 5th his opposition to the United Nations forces entering Katanga, and warned the United Nations to pay attention to the "consequences" that its intervention in Katanga might cause. He denied rumors that the Belgian government had agreed to allow United Nations troops to enter Katanga Province. He said that Belgium could only agree to the United Nations sending a "symbolic force" to Katanga, with the task of personally understanding the "orderly" situation there.

The Belgian government issued another statement after a cabinet meeting on the 5th, stating that if United Nations troops entered Katanga, "disturbances" might occur in Katanga.

At the same time, Katanga Province Governor Tshombe, under the protection of the Belgian army, has announced a so-called "general mobilization" in Katanga Province, preparing to "resist" the United Nations troops that are to enter Katanga Province.

It is reported that Hammarskjöld has rushed back to New York yesterday. The Security Council is scheduled to meet on the 7th to discuss this issue. At the same time, Bunch will go to Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga, again today to continue talks on this matter.

As everyone knows, this series of activities surrounding the issue of Congo's richest province, Katanga, is an important part of the imperialist bloc's plot, led by the United States, to occupy Congo for a long time.

In order to safeguard its interests in Katanga Province, the Belgian government had been carrying out a conspiracy to split Congo even before Congo's independence, attempting to place Katanga Province under the control of Belgian monopoly capital for a long time. This time, after the Belgian government openly sent troops to invade Congo, the Belgian colonialists' activities to split Congo have become even more blatant and rampant. On the third day of Belgium's dispatch of troops to Congo, Katanga Province Governor Tshombe, under the protection of the Belgian colonial army, announced "independence" and immediately appointed a Belgian officer as the "commander of all police and military forces" in Katanga Province. The Belgian government constantly sent "special envoys" to Katanga to hold talks with Tshombe, and openly announced that it would "cooperate" with the "independent" Katanga authorities and provide the Tshombe group with specialized "technical assistance," etc. At the same time, the Belgian authorities have consistently opposed the entry of United Nations troops, supported by the United States, into Katanga Province, declaring that Belgian troops would occupy Katanga Province for a long time.

However, this plan of Belgium has been resolutely opposed by U.S. imperialism. Katanga's rich minerals have huge economic and strategic interests for the United States. From the beginning of the imperialist bloc's interference in Congo's conspiracy, led by the United States, the United States has been attempting to infiltrate its power into the entire Congo under the banner of the "United Nations." U.S. monopoly capital is particularly greedy for Katanga's resources. After the United States rushed United Nations troops into Congo, it actively carried out activities in the name of "maintaining Congo's unity," wanting to send United Nations troops into Katanga Province.

While the United States is competing with Belgium for Katanga, Britain, France, and other countries are also actively carrying out activities, attempting to occupy a territory in this rich Congolese land in order to safeguard their respective interests. The British ruling clique, through the Prime Minister Welensky of the Central African Federation, which is controlled by it, is also continuing to seize the opportunity to conspire to annex Katanga Province. When the Congolese people's struggle broke out this time, Welensky immediately deployed troops to the border of Katanga Province. After Tshombe announced Katanga's "independence," the British government sent a diplomatic official to the British Consulate in Elisabethville to serve as a "special advisor," strengthening "contact" with the Tshombe authorities.

The French ruling clique has recently expressed blatant support for Belgium's activities to seize Katanga Province, harboring selfish intentions, and expressed dissatisfaction with the activities of the United States and Britain.

The struggle over Katanga is an epitome of the current imperialist conspiracy against Congo. It shows that the imperialist countries, led by the United States, whether they use direct armed aggression or carry out aggression under the banner of the "United Nations," whether they use open secession or the name of "unifying Congo," are all for the purpose of continuing to plunder and enslave the Congolese people.

### 新老殖民主义疯狂争夺刚果富源  美国阴谋假联合国之名攫取加丹加  比利时竭力抵制美国伸手　英法也想混水摸鱼

    新老殖民主义疯狂争夺刚果富源
    美国阴谋假联合国之名攫取加丹加
    比利时竭力抵制美国伸手　英法也想混水摸鱼
    新华社6日讯　以美国为首的帝国主义集团在相互勾结镇压刚果人民反殖民主义斗争的同时，这个集团内部也正在为着争夺刚果最富饶的加丹加省而展开激烈的斗争。美国正在积极策划把联合国军队开入加丹加省，以代替比利时侵略者，而比利时政府则正在竭力抵抗这种计划，一心想使加丹加继续保持在比利时重兵占领之下。
    据最新消息，得到美国国务院赞许的联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德宣告的联合国军6日进入加丹加的计划已经暂时宣告停顿。哈马舍尔德5日宣布，他已经要求联合国安全理事会开会，讨论联合国军队进入加丹加的问题。
    哈马舍尔德是在联合国副秘书长、美国人本奇去加丹加省活动后，以及比利时方面一再表示反对联合国军去加丹加之后宣布他的推迟计划的。在这以前，哈马舍尔德本人最近一直在利奥波德维尔，为这件事进行了紧张的活动。
    美国国务院曾经对哈马舍尔德的计划表示公开的满意，美国国务院发言人怀特称赞哈马舍尔德的活动使加丹加局势出现了“有希望的迹象”。
    但是，美国的这一以联合国军代替比利时侵略军的计划一直遭到比利时政府的坚决反抗。在哈马舍尔德宣布了联合国军将开进加丹加省的决定之后，比利时首相伊斯更斯在3日发表谈话，表示反对联合国干涉加丹加的所谓“内政”。伊斯更斯5日又重申反对联合国军开进加丹加，并且要联合国注意它干预加丹加可能造成的“后果”。他否认一度传出的关于比利时政府已经同意让联合国军队进入加丹加省的说法。他说，比利时只能同意联合国派遣一支“象征性部队”到加丹加去，任务是亲自了解一下那里“秩序井然”的情况。
    比利时政府5日在内阁会议之后又发表声明，表示如果联合国军队进入加丹加，加丹加可能发生“骚乱”。
    同时，在比利时军队保护下的加丹加省省长冲伯已经宣布在加丹加省实行所谓“总动员”，准备“抵抗”要进入加丹加省的联合国军队。
    据报道，哈马舍尔德已经在昨天匆匆赶回纽约。安理会已定在7日举行会议讨论这个问题。同时，本奇将在今天再度去加丹加首府伊利沙伯维尔，继续就这件事举行会谈。
    众所周知，围绕着刚果的最富饶的加丹加省问题所进行的这一系列活动，是以美国为首的帝国主义集团打算长期占领刚果的阴谋的一个重要部分。
    比利时政府为了维护它在加丹加省的利益，早在刚果独立前就已经在进行分裂刚果的阴谋活动，企图把加丹加省长期置于比利时垄断资本控制之下。这次，在比利时政府公开出兵侵略刚果之后，比利时殖民主义者分裂刚果的活动也随之更加露骨和猖狂起来。就在比利时出兵刚果的第三天，加丹加省省长冲伯就在比利时殖民军队的保护下宣布“独立”，并且马上任命了一个比利时军官充当加丹加省“所有警察和军事部队的司令”。比利时政府不断派遣“特使”到加丹加去同冲伯会谈，并且公开宣布要同“独立”的加丹加当局“合作”，要给予冲伯集团以专门的“技术援助”等。与此同时，比利时当局一直坚持反对受美国支持的联合国军队进入加丹加省，宣称比利时军队要长期占领加丹加省。
    但是，比利时的这种打算遭到美帝国主义的坚决反对。加丹加的丰富矿产对美国有着巨大的经济和战略上的利益，从以美国为首的帝国主义集团干涉刚果的阴谋一开始，美国就假借“联合国”的招牌企图把它的势力渗入整个刚果。美国垄断资本对加丹加的富源尤其馋涎欲滴。美国把联合国军队赶运进刚果之后，便以“维护刚果统一”为名积极进行活动，想把联合国军队开进加丹加省。
    在美国同比利时争夺加丹加的同时，英、法等国也在积极进行活动，企图在这块富饶的刚果的土地上占据一块地盘，以维护它们各自的利益。英国统治集团通过受它控制的中非联邦的总理韦伦斯基也继续在伺机阴谋并吞加丹加省。当这次刚果人民斗争爆发后，韦伦斯基就马上陈兵加丹加省的边境。在冲伯宣布加丹加“独立”之后，英国政府又派了一个外交官员到英国驻伊利沙伯维尔领事馆去充当“特别顾问”，加强同冲伯当局的“联系”。
    法国统治集团最近也怀着利己的打算对比利时攫取加丹加省的活动表示露骨的支持，并且对美、英的活动表示不满。
    关于加丹加的争夺，是目前帝国主义对刚果的阴谋的一个缩影。它表明，以美国为首的帝国主义国家，不论是用直接武装侵略还是用“联合国”的招牌进行侵略；不论是用公开割裂还是“统一刚果”的名义，都是为了继续掠夺和奴役刚果人民。
