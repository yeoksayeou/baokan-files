(Our dispatch from Shenyang, August 23) In order to make up for the losses caused by this flood, Liaoning rural areas are carrying out an increase production and economize movement centered on grain. The masses in the disaster areas, under the slogan of "production for self-salvation, rebuild our homes," are actively draining water and supporting seedlings, rushing to plant late autumn crops, and vigorously restoring production. The broad masses in non-disaster areas, under the slogan of "increase production and economize to support disaster areas," are strengthening late-stage field management, striving to increase harvests on the existing basis.
    
The general situation on Liaoning Province's agricultural front this year is good. Despite the continuous occurrence of summer weed infestation and insect pests, and the unprecedented heavy rain and floods in some areas in early August, the degree of disaster has been greatly reduced and has promoted the continuous development of production, relying on the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune system, the strong support of industry, and the concerted efforts of urban and rural people. At present, crops in non-disaster areas are generally growing well, and the situation in some of the disaster-stricken areas has also improved after days of drainage and rescue. In order to tap the potential for increased grain production and make up for the losses caused by the disaster, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee recently issued a fighting call to the entire province to firmly grasp late-stage field management, plant more late autumn crops, and strive to increase harvests. Under the leadership of the Party committees, the peasants in various places are in high spirits and full of energy, and are setting off a new upsurge of increasing production and economizing. Grain producing areas are taking the lead, and many counties and communes have taken aggressive measures and focused on management based on the different growth conditions of crops. Since mid-August, in Jinzhou, Fuxin, Chaoyang, Lushun-Dalian, Shenyang and other regions, an average of more than 1.7 million labor forces have been fighting in the fields every day, loosening the soil (middle cultivation) of 500,000 hectares, weeding 470,000 kilograms, and universally applying fertilizer to class three seedlings. In order to meet the needs of topdressing, many communes also took advantage of the hot weather, tender grass, and abundant water to vigorously accumulate fertilizer and compost manure. After additional measures, crops have grown very well in various places.
    
Areas that have suffered from flood disasters are seizing the time to drain water and support seedlings, and rush to plant late autumn crops. The Shaling Commune in Liaoyang City, a severely affected area, with the heroic spirit of man's determination to conquer nature, mobilized 2,500 commune members to rush to repair the main irrigation canals of the paddy fields day and night. Now, 4,000 hectares of paddy fields have all returned to normal irrigation. After the heavy rain, the Nankouqian Commune in Qingyuan County immediately organized commune members to drain water and support seedlings, draining water and supporting seedlings for more than 400 hectares in just three days. Fushun, Anshan, Benxi, Andong and other regions had planted 67,000 hectares of various autumn vegetables by the 15th. Now, the vegetable seedlings that were planted earlier have sprouted one after another, and the commune members are focusing on field management of vegetable fields, striving for a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables.
    
In order to better complete field management operations, many communes and teams throughout the province have rationally adjusted their labor organization and transferred strong labor forces to enrich the front line of field management. The Xiaoshalitu Brigade of the Fengjia Commune in Zhangwu County recently selected 450 laborers and put them into field management, accounting for 85% of the total labor force. Some communes have also vigorously promoted new-style tools for topdressing, spraying, and middle cultivation, which have also achieved remarkable results in saving labor.
    
In the process of vigorously grasping field management, the industrial departments of Liaoning Province continued to provide strong support to agriculture. The staff and workers of the Yingkou Municipal Industrial Department worked hard for three days and nights to assemble 105 sets of drainage and irrigation equipment, which were transported to the disaster areas overnight to support drainage and seedling support. After completing the manufacturing tasks of summer hoeing and pest control tools, the Yixian County machinery industry sector rushed to manufacture more than 4,500 pieces of field management and autumn harvesting tools. The Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant in Shenyang City sent 23 advanced workers, including the famous labor models Wei Fengying and Wang Lanzhi, to the suburbs to help repair agricultural machinery. In addition, many cities have organized a large number of workers to go to the countryside to help disaster areas rush to plant autumn vegetables, which greatly encouraged the fighting spirit of the people in the disaster areas.
    
The key to good field management lies in strengthening leadership. Cadres at all levels in rural Liaoning continue to go deep into the front line of the fields, participate in production, and lead production. The main cadres of the Black Mountain County Party Committee and various departments eat, live, work, and discuss with the commune members. Under their leadership, the county applied topdressing to 3,000 hectares and eliminated weeds from 5,000 hectares in six days. In the disaster areas, leading cadres at all levels have insisted on being on the front line day and night, personally leading the masses to rescue crops, rush to plant autumn vegetables, repair houses, and arrange the lives of the masses, giving full play to the fine style of sharing weal and woe with the masses, thus powerfully promoting the rapid development of the production and self-salvation movement in the disaster areas.

    辽宁狠抓粮食生产弥补水灾损失
    受灾区排水扶苗抢种晚秋努力生产自救
    非灾区加强后期田间管理提高秋季收成
    本报沈阳23日电　为了弥补这次水灾造成的损失，辽宁农村开展以粮食为中心的增产节约运动。灾区群众正在“生产自救，重建家园”的口号下，积极排水扶苗，抢种晚秋作物，大力恢复生产。广大非灾区群众正在“增产节约支援灾区”的口号下，加强后期田间管理，力争在现有的基础上增加收成。
    辽宁省今年农业战线总的形势是良好的。尽管夏季草荒、虫害连续发生，8月初部分地区又遭到了百年罕见的暴雨洪水，但是依靠党中央和毛主席的英明领导，依靠人民公社制度的无比优越，依靠工业大力支援和城乡人民的一致努力，受灾程度大大减轻，并且推动生产继续向前发展。目前，非灾区庄稼一般生长良好，受灾的部分地区经过连日排水抢救，情形也有好转。为了发掘粮食增产潜力，弥补灾害造成的损失，辽宁省委最近向全省提出狠抓农田后期管理，多种晚秋作物，力争增加收成的战斗号召。各地农民在党委的领导下，斗志昂扬，干劲冲天，正在掀起一个热火朝天的增产节约新高潮。产粮区一马当先，许多县社纷纷根据作物生长的不同情况，猛加措施，狠抓管理。锦州、阜新、朝阳、旅大、沈阳等地区，8月中旬以来，平均每天有一百七十多万劳动大军奋战田野，已放秋垅（中耕）五十万公顷，锄草四十七万公斤，还给三类苗普遍追了一次肥。为了满足追肥的需要，许多公社还趁天热、草嫩、水多的时机，大搞积肥沤粪。经过追加措施，各地庄稼生长很好。
  遭受洪水灾害的地区，正抓紧排水扶苗，抢种晚秋作物。重灾区辽阳市沙岭公社，以人定胜天的英雄气概，出动两千五百名社员，昼夜突击抢修水田干渠，现在四千公顷水田全部恢复正常灌溉。清原县南口前公社，在暴雨以后立即组织社员排水扶苗，仅三天即排水扶苗四百多公顷。抚顺、鞍山、本溪、安东等地区到15日止种上各种秋菜六万七千公顷。现在，种得早的菜苗已经陆续出土，社员们正大抓菜田的田间管理，力争秋菜丰收。
    为了更好地完成田间管理作业，全省许多社、队都合理地调整了劳动组织，抽调精壮劳动力充实了田间管理第一线。彰武县冯家公社小沙力土大队，最近挑选四百五十名劳动力，投放到田间管理上去，占总劳动力的85％。还有些公社大力推广追肥、打药、中耕等新式工具，也取到了节省劳力的显著作用。
    在大抓田间管理的过程中，辽宁省各工业部门继续对农业进行了有力的支援。营口市工业部门职工苦战三昼夜，配成一百零五套排灌设备，连夜运往灾区支援排水扶苗。义县机械工业部门，在完成夏锄灭虫工具的制造任务后，又赶造出田间管理和秋收工具四千五百多件。沈阳市东北机器制造厂，派出二十三名先进工人，其中包括著名劳动模范尉凤英、王兰芝等，到市郊帮助修复农业机具。另外，不少城市都组织了大批工人下乡，帮助灾区抢种秋菜，大大鼓舞了灾区人民的斗志。
    搞好田间管理的关键在于加强领导。辽宁农村各级干部继续深入田间第一线，参加生产，领导生产。黑山县委和各部门主要干部，与社员同吃同住同劳动同商量。在他们的领导带动下，全县六天追肥三千公顷，消灭草荒五千公顷。在灾区，各级领导干部更是日夜坚持在第一线，亲自带领群众抢救庄稼，抢种秋菜，修葺房屋，安排群众生活，充分发扬了与群众同甘共苦的优良作风，因而有力地推动了灾区生产自救运动的迅速开展。（附图片）
