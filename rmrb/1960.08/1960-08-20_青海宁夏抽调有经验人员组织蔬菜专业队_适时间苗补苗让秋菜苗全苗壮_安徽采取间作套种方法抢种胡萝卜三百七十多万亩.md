Xinhua News Agency, Xining. Qinghai Province, in response to the characteristics of this year's large autumn vegetable planting area, many varieties, and diversified planting methods, has launched autumn vegetable field management according to local conditions and in a timely manner.

People's communes in Minhe, Jianzha, and other counties along the warmer Yellow River and Huangshui River generally adopt the method of organizing vegetable field management professional teams to carefully manage the large areas of land collectively sown. People's communes in the river valley areas of Jianzha County have fully started thinning and replanting autumn vegetables. The vegetable field management professional team of the Duoba People's Commune in Xining City, while weeding, has already applied fertilizer to the vegetable fields and sprayed 666 powder to prevent pests and diseases.

This year, the autumn vegetable planting area of people's communes and state-owned farms in Qinghai Province has expanded more than twice compared to the same period last year. The average person in the province's agricultural and pastoral areas has planted four fen of autumn vegetables. In the mass movement to rush-plant autumn vegetables, some pastoral areas that had never grown vegetables before also adopted practical and effective measures to plant autumn vegetables on a large scale. The Guasize People's Commune and Qukuhu People's Commune in Tongren County, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, selected commune members with vegetable planting experience to form technical teaching groups to "teach" in the fields, helping Tibetan commune members learn vegetable planting techniques.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan. After the basic completion of autumn vegetable rush planting in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, all communes have generally transferred commune members with vegetable planting experience to form vegetable field management professional teams or groups. These teams strengthen the field management of autumn vegetables that are emerging successively, timely thinning, replanting, watering, loosening the soil, and topdressing to ensure full and strong seedlings. In areas prone to pests and diseases, in addition to applying medicine to the soil or treating seeds with pesticides during sowing, pesticide spraying is carried out in conjunction with watering, weeding, and thinning after the seedlings emerge. Some units such as government offices, schools, factories, and mines, which have not grown vegetables or have rarely grown vegetables in the past, have also actively linked up with communes or scientific and technical departments to learn techniques from vegetable farmers or technical cadres to strengthen autumn vegetable management.

The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has planted more than 250,000 mu of autumn vegetables, an expansion of nearly three times compared to last year's autumn vegetable area. Generally, each person has planted one to two fen of autumn vegetables. The five counties in the Guyuan Special Zone in the southern mountainous area have planted an average of more than two fen and four li of autumn vegetables per person. Many public canteens and production teams have planted an average of about one mu of vegetables per person.

Hefei, 19th of this newspaper - Anhui Province is seizing the current favorable opportunity to plant large quantities of high-yield crop carrots, which can be used as both food and vegetables. As of the 16th, the province has sown more than 3.72 million mu. The mass rush-planting is continuing and will continue until the end of the summer heat.

Planting large quantities of carrots is an important measure for Anhui Province to fully tap the potential of the land to increase grain and vegetable production. The Fuyang Special Zone has used early corn stubble, melon stubble, spring vegetable stubble, and vacant land around houses, along rivers, and between forests to sow 470,000 mu of carrots. Most of the 80,000 mu of carrots planted in Chuxian and Suixi counties in the Bengbu Special Zone are intercropped with corn and pumpkins, and some are planted using vacant land. Huaiyuan County intercrops in 80% of soybean, buckwheat, and other crop land according to the different growing seasons of crops, so that the county can plant more than 280,000 mu of carrots.

In order to plant enough carrots well, the responsible comrades of party committees at all levels, in addition to focusing on the arrangement of land stubble, labor, and actively raising seeds and fertilizers, also went deep into the fields to inspect the sowing work. Some counties and communes have also held symposiums with old farmers and technicians to summarize last year's carrot harvest experience and provide specific guidance for this year's planting. At the same time, a certain amount of labor was drawn to form professional teams, assign tasks, clarify responsibilities, contract for planting, and carry out comparison and competition activities between communes and communes, teams and teams, and people and people to compare progress and quality, further promoting the planting of carrots quickly and well.

    青海宁夏抽调有经验人员组织蔬菜专业队
    适时间苗补苗让秋菜苗全苗壮
    安徽采取间作套种方法抢种胡萝卜三百七十多万亩
    据新华社西宁讯　青海省针对今年秋菜种植面积大、品种多、种植方法多样化等特点，因时、因地制宜展开了秋菜田间管理。
    黄河、湟水沿岸气候较暖的民和、尖扎等县的人民公社，一般采取组织蔬菜田间管理专业队，精心管理集体播种的大片土地。尖扎县川水地区各人民公社已经全面开始秋菜的间苗和补种工作。西宁市哆吧人民公社的蔬菜田间管理专业队在锄草的同时，已经给菜地追施肥料，还给菜地喷洒了六六六药粉，防治病虫害。
    今年，青海省各人民公社、国营农牧场秋菜播种面积比去年同期扩大两倍多，全省农牧业区平均每人已种秋菜四分地。在抢种秋菜的群众运动中，牧业区一些从来没有种过蔬菜的地方也采取了切实有效的措施，大种秋菜。黄南藏族自治州同仁县瓜什则人民公社、曲库乎人民公社，挑选了有种菜经验的社员组成技术传授小组，到地头“上课”，帮助藏族社员学会种菜技术。
    新华社银川讯　宁夏回族自治区在抢种秋菜基本结束后，各公社都已普遍抽调有种菜经验的社员组成蔬菜田间管理专业队或小组，加强对陆续出苗的秋菜的田间管理，适时间苗、补苗、浇水、松土和追肥，保证苗全苗旺。易于发生病虫害的地区，除播种时实行了土壤施药或药剂拌种外，菜苗一出土又结合浇水、锄草、间苗进行喷药灭虫。一些过去没种过蔬菜或很少种过蔬菜的机关、学校、厂矿等单位，也主动地同公社或科学技术部门挂钩，向菜农或技术干部学习技术，加强秋菜管理。
    宁夏回族自治区已种秋菜二十五万多亩，比去年秋菜面积扩大近三倍，一般平均每人都种秋菜一分到二分。南部山区的固原专区五个县平均每人种秋菜两分四厘多，有不少公共食堂和生产队平均每人种菜达一亩左右。
    本报合肥19日电　安徽省抓住当前有利时机，大种既能当粮食又能当蔬菜吃的高产作物胡萝卜。全省到16日止已播种三百七十二万多亩，群众性的抢种工作正在继续，将进行到处暑。
    大种胡萝卜，是安徽省充分挖掘土地潜力增产粮食和蔬菜的一个重要措施。阜阳专区利用早玉米茬、瓜茬、春菜茬和家前屋后、河边林间等空隙地，已播种胡萝卜四十七万亩。蚌埠专区的滁县、濉溪两县已种的八万亩胡萝卜，大部分都是套种在玉米和南瓜等地里，有些是利用空隙地种植的。怀远县根据作物生长季节的不同，在80％的黄豆、荞麦等作物地里套种，这样全县就可多种胡萝卜二十八万多亩。
    为了把胡萝卜种足种好，各级党委负责同志除一面大抓土地茬口、劳力的安排和积极筹集种子、肥料外，一面深入田间检查播种工作。有的县、社还召开老农、技术员座谈会，总结去年胡萝卜丰收经验，具体指导今年种植。同时，还抽出一定的劳力组成专业队，交代任务，明确责任，包干种植；并开展社与社、队与队、人与人比进度、比质量的评比竞赛运动，进一步促使把胡萝卜种的又快又好。
