Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Léopoldville: The Congolese army and people are continuing their anti-colonialist struggle. According to reports, in Kivu Province, some Congolese soldiers who were forcibly disarmed by UN forces are continuing their struggle against the colonialists and have clashed with police officers commanded by Belgian officers who came to interfere.

In northern Katanga Province, the sentiment of the local people against the Belgian colonialists who have been riding roughshod over them is constantly rising. Agence France-Presse also acknowledged in a news report that the Congolese residents there are "generally hostile" to the colonialists.

UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld is continuing to work on a plan for the long-term retention of UN forces in the Congo, which are actually controlled by the United States. However, according to Reuters, Hammarskjöld's proposal for the UN to remain in the Congo for a long time is encountering "strong opposition."

According to an announcement by the UN Force Command on August 1st, the number of UN forces in the Congo has reached more than 11,100. Many reports indicate that the UN forces' attitude of systematically disarming the Congolese army while protecting the Belgian aggressor forces has aroused dissatisfaction among Congolese government officials and mass organizations. The Congo Youth Association issued a statement at a press conference in Léopoldville, condemning the entry of UN European forces into the Congo as an "imperialist conspiracy." The statement strongly condemned the Western imperialist countries and called on all Congolese nationalist parties to unite against Moise Tshombe, the governor of Katanga Province and a traitor. Tshombe, according to the will of imperialism, had declared Katanga Province's secession from the Congo and "independence."

According to reports, Tshombe is now intensifying his activities to split Katanga from the Congo. For example, he has declared the Katanga Provincial Council to be the "House of Representatives" and is preparing to establish a so-called "Katanga National Bank." On the other hand, he is persecuting patriotic Congolese soldiers. News says that in Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province, in addition to eighty Congolese soldiers who have already been sentenced, eighty-seven patriotic soldiers have been accused of "mutiny," and seventeen soldiers have been arrested on charges of "murder."

News says that some Belgian colonialists who once lorded it over the Congo are re-entering the Congo under the name of UN "technical assistance." News also says that some European colonial officials and foreign capitalists who were driven out by the Congolese army and people have returned to Léopoldville, which is under the control of UN forces.

    刚果军民坚持反殖民主义斗争
    哈马舍尔德大肆活动想使美国操纵的联合国军长期留在刚果
    新华社2日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果军民继续在坚持着反殖民主义斗争。据报道，在基伍省，一些被联合国军强行解除武装的刚果士兵继续在进行反抗殖民者的斗争，并且同前来干涉的、由比籍警官指挥的警察发生冲突。
    在刚果加丹加省北部，当地人民反对一直骑在他们头上的比利时殖民者的情绪不断高涨。法新社在一则消息中也承认，那里的刚果居民“普遍敌视”殖民者。
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德正在继续为实际上由美国操纵的联合国军长期留在刚果的计划活动。但是据路透社透露，哈马舍尔德的由联合国长久留在刚果的主张正遇到“强烈的反对”。
    据联合国军司令部1日宣布，在刚果的联合国军人数已经达到一万一千一百余名。许多消息说明，联合国军有计划地解除刚果军队的武装、同时包庇比利时侵略军的态度，引起了刚果政府官员和群众团体的不满。刚果青年协会曾在利奥波德维尔举行的一次记者招待会上发表声明，谴责联合国欧洲国家军队进入刚果是一个“帝国主义阴谋”。声明强烈谴责西方帝国主义国家，并且呼吁刚果一切民族主义政党团结起来反对加丹加省省长、叛徒冲伯。冲伯按照帝国主义的意旨，曾宣布加丹加省脱离刚果“独立”。
    据报道，冲伯现在一方面加紧进行把加丹加分裂出刚果的活动，例如把加丹加的省议会宣布改为“众议院”，还准备设立所谓“加丹加国家银行”；另一方面，正在迫害爱国的刚果士兵。消息说，在加丹加省省会伊利沙伯维尔，除八十名刚果士兵已经判刑外，有八十七名爱国士兵被控进行“叛变”，还有十七名士兵以所谓“谋杀”的罪名被捕。
    消息说，一些曾在刚果作威作福的比利时殖民者正在联合国“技术援助”的名义下重新进入刚果。消息还说，一些曾被刚果军民赶走的欧洲殖民官员和外国资本家也已回到了由联合国军控制下的利奥波德维尔。
