    Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: Coal mine departments across the country are currently rushing to build a batch of coal bins and mechanized coal storage yards as an important measure to vigorously promote coal transportation. According to statistics, from the beginning of the year to now, 186 new coal bins of various types and 72 mechanized coal storage yards have been built in various places.
    These coal bins and storage yards are generally built on the loading lines of railways in mining areas. Their main function is to temporarily store coal produced in the mines and then promptly load it onto trains for transportation when railcars arrive. Therefore, all mines that have added coal bins and storage yards have not only increased their temporary coal storage capacity but have also achieved batch loading or full train loading, greatly shortening the turnaround time of freight cars in the mining area (including stop, load, unload) and accelerating the speed of vehicle turnover. For example, after adding a large number of modern storage bins this year, plus other measures, the single turnaround time for freight cars in the Fuxin Coal Mine has been shortened from more than five hours in the past to about three or four hours. Due to the increased ground storage capacity, most of the mine's shafts can now meet the requirement of continuing production for three days even if no cars arrive. After adding coal bins and storage yards, the Jiahe, Jingxing, and Kailuan coal mines have seen a significant increase in the amount of coal transported each day due to the greatly shortened loading time, essentially eliminating the phenomenon of coal being unloaded on the ground and then manually loaded onto cars.
    Among the large number of coal bins that have already been built, a large portion are slope-style coal bins, built by summarizing China's many years of experience in building coal bins and adopting a combination of local and foreign methods. Because this type of coal bin makes full use of the terrain slope and strives to adapt to local conditions and utilize local materials, it is not only quick to build and saves materials, but also has a large capacity and high loading efficiency. For example, a large 450-meter-long slope-style coal bin built by the Shanxi Yin Huang Coal Mine in just half a month can load an entire train in an average of two minutes, an efficiency 119 times higher than manual loading.

    Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: Coal mines across the country are vigorously promoting the construction of railways in mining areas. According to statistics from more than 100 mining areas, since the beginning of April, 376 railway spur lines and light railways of various types have been built, with a total length of approximately 880 kilometers. Among them, 168 lines have already been put into use, and the tracks of the remaining 200-plus lines have also been laid, with final construction work being accelerated.
    These spur lines and light railways are partly built in old mining areas with high coal production but insufficient transportation capacity, and partly in newly transferred mines and "small foreign groups" of mines that have developed rapidly in the past year or two. They are generally only one or two kilometers long, with the longest being no more than ten kilometers. Therefore, they are easy to build and quickly effective, and can promptly transport the coal produced and stored by the various mines. After the Shencunzi Mine of the Shandong Xinwen Mining Bureau completed the 1.62-kilometer spur line to the Nanxintai Mine in early May, it had already transported more than 75,000 tons of coal by August 10. After the light railways of the Jixi Mining Bureau leading to the Xiaohongsheng Dongshan Mine and the No. 4 Well of the Muling Mine were all completed, more than 43,000 tons of coking coal were transported in June and July, strongly supporting steel production and changing the accumulation of coal caused by insufficient transportation capacity in the past.
    Coal mine departments in various places attach great importance to the construction of railways in mining areas. Many coal mines have established specialized agencies, and key leading cadres have been assigned to lead and command this work. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Ministry of Railways and other departments have given strong support to various mining areas in terms of equipment, materials, and technical personnel. In order to enable the lines that have been built to be opened to traffic in a timely manner, the First Ministry of Machine Building has recently established a special office to be responsible for solving the production and supply of small locomotives.

    扩大储煤仓　修建运输网　促进煤增产
    全国煤矿新建储煤仓186座，贮煤场72个，铁路专用线376条
    据新华社27日讯　全国煤矿部门正在突击兴建一批煤仓和机械化的贮煤场，作为当前大抓煤炭运输的重要措施之一。据统计，从年初到现在，各地修建起来的各种新煤仓已有一百八十六座，机械化贮煤场七十二个。
    这些煤仓和储煤场一般都建设在矿区铁路的装车线上。它们的主要作用是把矿井里生产出来的煤炭暂时储存起来，等车皮来了以后及时装入火车运送出去。因此，凡是增设了煤仓和贮煤场的各矿，不仅增加了暂时贮存煤炭的能力，还做到了分批装车或整列装车，大大缩短了货车在矿区的一次作业（包括停留、装卸）时间，加快了车辆的周转速度。例如，阜新煤矿今年以来增建大批现代化的贮煤仓后，加上其他措施，目前货车在矿区的一次作业时间，已从过去的五个多小时普遍缩短到三、四小时左右。由于地面贮存能力增加，这个矿的大部分矿井都能作到三天不来车，产区照常生产的要求。蛟河、井陉、开滦等煤矿在增建一部分煤仓和储煤场后，由于装车时间大大缩短，目前每天运出的煤炭都比过去有了显著增加，基本上消灭了产煤落地后再组织人力装车的现象。
    在已经建成的大批煤仓中，有很大一部分是总结了我国多年来建设煤仓的经验，采用土洋结合的办法修建起来的滑坡式煤仓。这种煤仓由于充分利用了地形坡度，尽可能做到因地制宜、就地取材，不但建设速度快，材料省，而且容量大，装车效率也很高。如山西荫黄煤矿只用半个月突击建成的一座四百五十米长的大型滑坡式煤仓，平均每两分钟就能装完一整列车，效率比人工装车提高了一百一十九倍。
    新华社27日讯　全国各地煤矿正在大抓矿区铁路的修建工作。根据一百多个矿区的统计，从4月初到现在，各地已修成各种铁路专用线和轻便铁道三百七十六条，总长度约八百八十多公里。其中有一百六十八条线路已经投入使用，其余二百多条线路的路轨也都铺设完毕，正在加紧进行收尾工程。
    这些专用线和轻便铁道，一部分建筑在产煤较多而运输能力不足的老矿区，一部分建在新移交生产的矿井和最近一、两年来迅速发展起来的“小洋群”矿井。它们一般只有一、二公里长，最长的也不过十多公里。因此建设容易，收效快，能够把各矿生产和储存的煤炭及时抢运出来。山东新汶矿务局沈村子矿在5月初修成通往南新泰矿井的一点六二公里专用线以后，到8月10日就已经运出煤炭七万五千多吨。鸡西矿务局通往小恒山东山矿和穆棱矿四号井的轻便铁道全部修通后，6、7两个月内，也已经运出焦煤四万三千多吨，有力地支援了钢铁生产，改变了过去因为运力不足而经常发生的存煤积压现象。
    各地煤矿部门十分重视矿区铁路的建设工作，许多煤矿都成立了专门机构，并由主要负责干部分工领导和指挥这一工作。冶金工业部和铁道部等部门，从设备、材料、技术力量等方面，给予各矿区大力支援。为了使已经修建起来的线路能够及时通车，第一机械部在最近还成立了专门办公室，负责解决小机车的生产和供应问题。
