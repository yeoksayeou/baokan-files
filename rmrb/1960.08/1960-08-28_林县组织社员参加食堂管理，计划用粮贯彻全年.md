    Linxian Organizes Commune Members to Participate in Canteen Management, Planned Grain Use Implemented Throughout the Year
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Shanghai on the 27th) Chuansha County, Shanghai, has implemented a "Canteen Day" system. While cadres are going deep into the front lines of production, they are also focusing on daily life, making it regular and systematic. The county's canteens are getting better and better, and the production enthusiasm of commune members is even higher.
    The "Canteen Day" system in this county is that cadres, while participating in production and leading production for five days under the "two-five system," set aside one day to work in the county's more than 1,300 canteens. The county party committee and the commune party committee also regard the success of each cadre's assigned canteen as an important criterion for evaluating the cadre's work.
    The canteens in Chuansha County have always been run relatively well. After implementing the method of assigning people, time periods, and canteens, the canteen work has been raised to a new level. The canteen's family assets are becoming more substantial, and the vegetable fields have rapidly increased from 5,800 mu to more than 10,000 mu; the pigs, chickens, ducks, and fish raised by the canteens have increased by more than 10% respectively. At the same time, planned grain use and economical grain use have been further implemented, and the canteen's management system has also been further improved.
    Recently, the vast number of commune members in this county have been busily engaged in autumn field management. In order to strive for a high yield of autumn grain, the county has arranged for another 1,100 people to be transferred from nearly 5,000 canteen staff to support agriculture. The county party committee believes that under these circumstances, it is necessary to further improve the canteens, and the key to running the canteens well is the importance attached to them by the cadres, who should frequently go deep into the canteens and grasp the details. Since the county implemented the "two-five system" at the end of May this year, some commune cadres have set aside two days each month or one day each week to specifically manage the canteens, and those canteens have generally been run relatively well. The county party committee believes that this practice ensures that cadres can both lead the "front line" battle and grasp the "logistics" work, enriching the content of the "two-five" system. After extensively soliciting opinions from the commune party committees, the county party committee decided to establish a "Canteen Day" system.
    Cadres regularly going deep into the canteens allows the Party's policies to meet with the masses more quickly. In the previous period, in the implementation of planned grain use in canteens, 110 canteens had not established a system. After the "Canteen Day" system was implemented, the cadres in charge of the canteens, together with the small team leaders and cooks, discussed the matter, explained the significance of planned grain use to them, and helped them solve specific problems. As a result, the planned grain use system in these canteens was quickly established. In order to increase the supply of vegetables in the canteens and ensure that the commune members eat their fill, the county party committee called for the large-scale planting of vegetables. On the "Canteen Day," cadres at all levels worked with the small team cadres and cooks to formulate vegetable planting plans and plant vegetables together. Ding Mingfa, the secretary of the Sunxiaoqiao Commune Party Committee, went to the central canteen of the Caijia Production Team that he was in charge of, and together with the small team leader, the vegetable planting professional team leader, and the cooks, calculated the detailed accounts, arranged the stubble, and decided to use the gaps between the early rice harvest and the sowing of three wheat crops to seize the time to plant a crop of vegetables in the large fields, and summarized the experience of high-yield vegetables. The canteen's original four vegetable plots had the same vegetable varieties and sowing period, but seven mu and eight fen of vegetable land had been yielding about 500 jin of vegetables every day since May, while another eight mu of land had been yielding less than 100 jin of vegetables every day. After studying the matter, Ding Mingfa and the grassroots cadres and cooks found that the main reason was that the vegetable professional team had not implemented a responsibility system. After implementing the "three guarantees and one reward" system, this canteen not only managed all the original vegetable land in an orderly manner, but also expanded the vegetable land. Because every cadre is grasping the canteens and everyone has first-hand information from the masses, a new atmosphere has emerged in the study of canteen work, with everyone having information and everyone having ideas.
    Cadres at all levels regularly going deep into the canteens has greatly strengthened the political and ideological work of the canteens. At the same time, because a large number of cadres and cooks eat, live, work, and discuss matters together, the staff of each canteen deeply feel the Party's attention to the canteens, and their work is more active and enthusiastic. Many commune cooks use their brains and think of ways to improve the quality of food; during the rush harvesting of early rice and the rush planting of late rice, they have been delivering tea and meals to the fields, which has been welcomed by the commune members. Wang Huating, the secretary of the Huanglou Commune Party Committee, actively put forward many suggestions and methods when he was working in the joint canteen of the fourth and fifth small teams of the Langan Production Team on "Canteen Day." The original stove in this canteen was old-fashioned and consumed more than 600 jin of firewood every day. After joint research, the cooks worked tirelessly, building a "small-mouth backdraft heat-preservation stove" overnight with the Party Committee Secretary, saving more than half of the firewood burned every day. Shan Jiaxing, the deputy secretary of the Beicai Commune Party Committee, helped the cooks establish a weekly political study system after regularly working in the central canteen of the Chenqiao Production Team. The cooks have improved their ideological understanding and are working more actively.
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Zhengzhou on the 27th) Linxian County, Henan Province, earnestly persists in implementing planned grain use and economical grain use, day after day for two years. More than 86% of the county's public canteens have not only ensured that the commune members eat their fill, but also have surplus grain. The vast majority of communes and teams also have a certain amount of reserve grain.
    On the basis of extensively carrying out ideological education on the glory of thrift and planned grain use, the Linxian County Party Committee has focused on daily life as it focuses on production, and has mobilized commune members to formulate plans. In addition to formulating grain use plans on a seasonal and monthly basis according to the national grain standards, the canteens in this county have generally promoted small-segment life arrangements centered on ten-day meal charts. According to the busy and slack seasons of farm work, the meal charts specify the amount of grain, vegetables, oil, and salt to be prepared, and the amount of coal and firewood to be burned, on a daily and per-meal basis. These meal charts are formulated on the 8th, 18th, and 28th of each month by the canteen management committee and commune member representatives, based on the inspection and summary of the implementation of the meal chart for the previous ten days, and are implemented after being discussed and approved by the commune member congress. This method not only greatly strengthens the planning of canteen work, but also enriches the content of democratic management in the canteen. The benefits of implementing the ten-day meal chart system are mainly: First, because the masses can be fully mobilized to discuss the matter when formulating the meal chart, the democratic management of the canteen is greatly strengthened. The ten-day meal chart system has been generally implemented in all canteens in the county, and accounts are cleared and settled every ten days and announced on time. Second, it can flexibly arrange and adjust life according to the busy and slack seasons of farming and climate changes, so that there is a plan for every day and every meal, which is conducive to planned grain use and economical grain use. Third, it can achieve "three bottoms": leaders have a bottom line and can check the canteen's overeating or saving at any time; administrators and cooks have a bottom line and can prepare early for what to eat today and what to eat tomorrow, strengthening the planning of work; the masses have a bottom line and can better take the initiative to arrange their own lives. Thanks to the implementation of the ten-day meal chart system, 93% of the farmers in the county have formulated plans for economical grain use. Fourth, it can further strengthen the planning of canteen's arrangement of non-staple foods and fuel, and promote the rapid development of family production centered on vegetables. Many canteens plant vegetables on a large scale because the meal chart system specifies the amount of vegetables to be eaten on a daily and per-meal basis. At present, the canteens in the county generally have an average of three fen of vegetable land per person. (Attached picture)

### 林县组织社员参加食堂管理，计划用粮贯彻全年

    川沙县建立“食堂日”制度
    干部包干领导，七天到食堂工作一天；加强政治领导，炊事员干劲更足，抽出一千人参加农业生产，普遍实行计划用粮，家底生产迅速发展。
    林县组织社员参加食堂管理，计划用粮贯彻全年
    本报上海27日电　上海市川沙县实行了“食堂日”制度。各级干部在深入生产第一线的同时，狠抓生活，做到经常化、制度化。全县食堂越办越好，社员生产热情更加高涨。
    这个县的“食堂日”制度，是干部在执行“二五制”参加生产、领导生产的五天中，留出一天分头到全县一千三百多个食堂工作。县委和公社党委并把每个干部所包的食堂办得好坏，作为鉴定干部工作的一个重要标准。
    川沙县的食堂历来办得较好，实行定人、定期、定食堂的办法后，食堂工作又提高到一个新的水平。食堂家底更加充实，菜田迅速由五千八百亩增加到一万多亩；食堂养的猪鸡鸭鱼分别增加10％以上。与此同时，计划用粮、节约用粮得到进一步的贯彻，食堂的经营管理制度也更加完善。
    最近期间，这个县的广大社员正紧张地从事秋田管理。为了争取秋粮高产，全县经过安排，又从近五千个食堂工作人员中调出了一千一百人去支援农业。县委认为：在这种情况下，必须进一步把食堂办得更好，而办好食堂的关键是干部重视，经常深入食堂，抓深抓细。这个县从今年5月底实行“二五制”以后，就有一些公社干部每月划出两天或每周划出一天具体抓食堂，并使得那些食堂一般都办得比较出色。县委认为，这种做法保证干部既能领导“前方”战斗，又能抓好
  “后勤”工作，丰富了“二五”制内容。在广泛征求公社党委意见之后，县委确定建立“食堂日”制度。
    干部定期深入食堂，使党的政策可以更快地和群众见面。前一时期在贯彻食堂计划用粮中，有一百一十个食堂没有建立起制度。“食堂日”制度实行以后，包食堂的干部和小队长、炊事员共同商量，向他们讲明计划用粮的意义，又协助他们解决具体问题，于是，这些食堂的计划用粮制度就迅速建立起来。为了增加食堂蔬菜供应，保证社员吃饱吃好，县委曾号召大种蔬菜。各级干部在“食堂日”这天就和小队干部、炊事员一起制订种菜计划，并一起动手种菜。孙小桥公社党委书记丁明法到他所包的蔡家生产队中心食堂，同小队长、蔬菜种植专业组长、炊事员一起算细账、排茬口，确定在早稻收割后，三麦下种前的间隙里，利用大田抢种一熟蔬菜，并且总结了蔬菜高产经验。这个食堂原有的四片菜地，蔬菜品种和下种期都相同，但是有七亩八分菜地，5月份以来每天收菜五百斤左右，但另有八亩地每天收菜不到一百斤。丁明法和基层干部、炊事员研究后，发现主要原因是蔬菜专业组没有实行责任制。推行“三包一奖”制后，这个食堂不仅原有菜地全部管理得井井有条，而且扩大了菜地。由于干部人人抓食堂，每人都有来自群众的第一手材料，研究食堂工作时，出现了人人有情况、个个有主意的新气象。
    各级干部定期深入食堂，大大加强了食堂的政治思想工作。同时由于大批干部和炊事员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，各食堂的工作人员都深切感到党对食堂的重视，工作更加积极、热情。许多公社炊事员动脑筋，想办法，提高饭菜质量；在早稻抢收、后作稻抢种中，他们纷纷送茶送饭到田头，受到社员欢迎。黄楼公社党委书记王华亭在
  “食堂日”到栏杆生产队第四、五小队联合食堂劳动时，炊事员积极提出许多建议和办法。这个食堂原来的锅灶是老式的，每天要烧柴草六百斤以上，经过共同研究，炊事员不辞辛苦，连夜和党委书记一起建造“小口回风保温灶”，每天烧柴节约一半以上。北蔡公社党委副书记单加兴定期到陈桥生产队中心食堂劳动后，帮助炊事员建立每周一次的政治学习制度。炊事员提高了思想认识，工作更加积极。
    本报郑州27日电　河南省林县认真坚持实行计划用粮，节约用粮，两年如一日，全县86％以上的公共食堂不仅保证了社员吃饱吃好，而且都有了节余粮。绝大部分社队也都有了一定数量的储备粮。
    林县县委在广泛进行了节约光荣、计划用粮的思想教育基础上，像抓生产一样地狠抓生活，发动社员制订计划。这个县的食堂除了根据国家规定的粮食标准，按季按月订出用粮计划以外，都普遍推行了以十日饭表为中心的小段生活安排。根据农活忙闲，在饭表上都按天按顿规定了准备多少粮食、蔬菜和油盐，烧多少煤柴。这种饭表每月8、18、28日由食堂管理委员会和社员代表一起，在检查总结前十天饭表执行情况的基础上制订出来，经过社员大会讨论通过后执行。这个办法不仅大大加强了食堂工作的计划性，而且丰富了食堂民主管理的内容。推行十日饭表制的好处主要是：一、由于在制订饭表时，能够充分发动群众讨论，大大加强了食堂的民主管理。全县各食堂普遍实行了十日饭表制，都做到了账目旬清月结，按时公布。二、能根据农事忙闲和气候变化，灵活地安排和调剂生活，做到天天顿顿有打算，有利于计划用粮与节约用粮。三、可以做到“三蹬底”：领导有底，能随时查考食堂超吃或节约；管理员、炊事员有底，今天吃啥饭，明天吃啥饭，能早作准备，加强工作计划性；群众有底，可以更好地主动安排自己的生活。全县由于实行了十日饭表制，有93％的农户都订了节约用粮计划。四、能进一步加强食堂安排副食品和燃料的计划性，促进以蔬菜为中心的家底生产的迅速发展。许多食堂因为实行饭表制，按天按顿规定了吃菜的数量，都大种蔬菜。现在全县食堂一般每人平均有菜地三分。（附图片）
