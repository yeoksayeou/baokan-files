    Walls Full of Poetry and Painting, Bumper Harvest in Production
    Chu Chuny

    Our poetry and painting creation in Wangren Commune, Fuyang County, Anhui Province, began during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The Party Central Committee announced the General Line, the Great Leap Forward in production, and the great development of the people's commune movement. Our commune also built large-scale water conservancy projects, developed river networks, implemented rice reforms, and accumulated fertilizer on a large scale. Agricultural production achieved unprecedented bumper harvests, and everyone was filled with joy. As commune member Yang Fengjiang said: "Our commune's production is developing so fast, and our lives are so sweet. The more we think about it, the happier we become. When we are happy, we want to sing, write, and paint." Our commune's poetry and painting creation initially started in Lizhai Brigade. This brigade has more than 6,000 people. One night, more than 1,000 people held lanterns and whitewashed walls, and more than 800 people wrote poems and painted pictures. Lanterns and torches were everywhere, and the mood was very high. Li Rujiang, who was in his fifties, saw people painting and hurriedly asked his wife to hold a lamp, and together with his son and daughter, they started painting. Even Li Jiayun, who had a disabled hand, did not want to be idle. He said to everyone, I can't paint, but I have to hold a light for you. In this way, everyone took action, and in one night, the seven villages were all covered with new paintings on the walls. Everyone said: "In the past, we only looked at other people's paintings, but now we also look at our own paintings." At this time, in order to welcome the establishment of the people's commune, all the brigades were like celebrating a happy event, building archways, whitewashing walls, writing poems, and painting pictures. When paintbrushes were not enough, they were made of hemp. If there was no lime, they burned it themselves. If there were no pigments, they used red soil. Those who knew how to compose made compositions, those who knew how to color applied colors, those who knew how to compose used their mouths, and those who knew how to write used their hands. Even 65-year-old Wang Da Niang took the initiative to write poetry and encouraged her sons and grandsons to write poetry and paint, becoming a "poetry and painting family." In this way, the poetry and painting creation in our commune quickly became widespread. The commune members, seeing so many poems and paintings, sang: "Every family whitewashes walls to write poems and paint, colorful flags are planted all over the ground, gongs and drums sound to celebrate and sing, welcoming the people's commune."

    However, when poetry and painting creation had not yet started, some cadres engaged in cultural work looked down on us peasants and did not believe that we could write poetry and paint. Some even said: "A peasant with a leg covered in cow dung, what can he paint? Don't dirty the walls." Of course, everyone did not listen to these discouraging words and boldly painted. Take Yang Fengjiang, for example. He had begged for food for decades. He saw that the elementary school teacher had drawn only a few lines on the competition column on the wall, which was not very energetic. He picked up a pen and added a few flowers. His wife, Li Suolan, saw it, went up and picked up a pen and said: "Let me paint too." So one painted on the east wall and the other on the west wall, and the two painted several paintings in one breath. Yang Fengjiang painted a picture of "Live Capture of the American Wolf," and Li Suolan followed with a picture of "Lotus," with the poem: "Lotus blooms in all seasons, husband and wife paint and display it all over the street, over forty is just the right time, the blooming season will never fade." Later, those who did not believe that farmers could paint also changed their minds.

    At the beginning of 1959, the commune Party committee told us to draw more pictures in coordination with the central tasks, and everyone became even more enthusiastic. At the beginning of the spring production campaign this year, everyone painted a series of paintings on the "Eight-Character Charter" and the "1959 Production Targets." As the manure accumulation and fertilizer accumulation movement was underway, everyone painted many pictures promoting fertilizer accumulation. I also drew one. I heard that there were many mountains in Sichuan, so I drew many fertilizer piles, one pile after another standing like mountains reaching into the clouds. In the middle of the fertilizer piles, I drew a person and wrote a poem: "Returned home after three days away, I wondered if I had mistakenly gone to Sichuan. If this place is northern Anhui, why are there mountains everywhere." This painting played some role after it was posted. Xu Shifang, the captain of the Huamulan Team, saw it and said: "If we can accumulate so much fertilizer, we will definitely be able to increase grain production even more next year." That afternoon, their Huamulan Team piled up 65 piles of fertilizer. The Party called for the all-round development of agricultural production, and everyone quickly painted a series of paintings promoting the development of grain, oil, hemp, silkworms, sugar, tea, and other twelve industries. Everyone saw and composed a poem praising it: "Grain, oil, cotton, hemp, and silk, tea, tobacco, sugar, fruits, vegetables, medicinal herbs, and miscellaneous, Chairman Mao's instructions are twelve characters, every character is painted into a picture, drawn on the picture, remembered in the heart, everyone sees it and becomes energetic." The Party called for the development of animal husbandry, and everyone painted a picture of "Ten Livestock Flourishing." The Party called for vigorous development of pig raising, and everyone painted pictures promoting pig raising. This year in April, the Provincial Party Committee proposed the realization of aquatic production, and everyone immediately painted a picture of "The commune develops aquatic products, there are fish under the water and lotus above the water, Manchurian wild rice and fox nuts are all propagated, water caltrop grows densely and the water is not idle."

    In short, whatever the Party's central task is, our paintings vigorously promote it. This year, when the summer harvest was approaching, everyone painted a set of poetry and painting posters such as "Harvest Quickly, Thresh Quickly," "Grains Return Home," "Harvest While Planting," and "Do Not Delay Summer Planting" based on the requirements of the commune Party committee for the summer harvest, and inserted them on the roadside and in the wheat fields. These paintings played a great role; on the one hand, they reflected the soaring enthusiasm of the masses in production, and further encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses; on the other hand, they specifically publicized the Party's policies and tasks. The commune members were very satisfied with these paintings and said: "Now there is no need to ask about work, poetry and painting explain everything clearly, the policy, tasks, and policies, doing it according to it will surely succeed." Our poetry and painting creation is also closely coordinated with the political struggle and plays a combat role.

    In the past two years, our commune's poetry and painting creation has been not only developing quickly and widely, but also continuously developing and improving. Take myself, for example. In the past two years, under the leadership and cultivation of the Party, I have also made some progress. I originally could not paint at all and had never held a paintbrush. At first, I painted technical information on the wall. Although crops are all inanimate objects, we see them every day, but it is not easy to paint them. When painting sweet potato leaves, I could not remember exactly what sweet potato leaves looked like. I pulled up a sweet potato plant to compare with the painting. Gradually, I mastered the characteristics of these crops, and it became easier to start painting, and I also painted them more vividly. But I still couldn't paint people, and I couldn't grasp the proportions well. Either the arms were too long or the legs were too short. I couldn't paint the way people walk, the way they hold things, or the way they do productive labor. What should I do? Later, I asked my wife to pose for me to draw. For example, to draw labor, I would ask my wife to take a hoe and pose for a labor pose. She didn't want to, so I said good things: "For publicity, for work, please help me." Later, after many times, she didn't want to do it anymore, so I asked my children to pose for me to draw. The children were obedient and didn't have many things to do, so they could let me draw once, twice, or three times. Slowly, I learned to draw people. I also learned a little about proportions and perspective. Of course, we have not learned enough, and we must continue to work hard in the future.

    In the past two years, we have not only improved our painting skills, but more importantly, under the education of the Party, our political level has improved, and therefore we have also improved in the selection of themes and the ability to express them. Once I saw that the cotton in the commune was more than a meter tall, and the cotton bolls were white and large, so I painted a picture expressing the great bumper harvest of cotton. I painted a boundless cotton field, with only the braid of the cotton picking girl showing. I also wrote a poem: "Improved cotton is better than white clouds, the bolls are large, the branches are dense, and the plants are deep, the girls picking cotton sing songs, only hearing the singing and not seeing the people." The commune members saw it and said: "You have moved our high-yield cotton fields onto paper." The Party secretary also said that this painting was better than before.

    Now, more than 34,000 people in our commune have participated in poetry and painting creation. In the past two years, we have created a total of 12.68 million folk songs and more than 4.14 million poems and paintings. Everyone is very happy that so many people are writing poetry and painting, writing so many poems, and painting so many paintings. The commune members composed a song saying: "In the past, we were illiterate, but now we have become both literary and military, able to write poetry and paint, and the paintings on the walls are full of red." Speaking of our commune's production, under the leadership of the Party, we have realized river network construction and rice cultivation since the Great Leap Forward, and grain production has also been continuously improved. "Strive for a double bumper harvest of production, poetry, and painting, and make contributions to go to Beijing." This is the wish of all the commune members in our commune.

    诗画满墙　生产丰收
    储纯一
    我们安徽省阜阳县王人公社的诗画创作是在1958年大跃进当中开展起来的。党中央公布了总路线，生产大跃进，人民公社化运动大发展，我们公社也大兴水利，大搞河网化，大搞稻改，大搞积肥，农业生产空前大丰收，人人喜洋洋，正如社员杨凤江说的：“我们公社生产发展这样快，日子过得这样甜，越想越高兴，心里一高兴，就想唱，想写，想画。”我们公社的诗画创作，起初是从李砦大队开始的。这个大队共有六千多人，一夜就有一千多人提灯粉墙，八百多人写诗画画，到处灯笼火把，情绪很高。五十多岁的李如江见到人家画画，急忙叫老伴打着灯，和儿子闺女一起画起来。连一只手残废的李家云也不愿闲着，他向大家说，我不能画画，也得给你们提个灯。就这样，大家动手，一个晚上七个庄子就都是新画满墙。大家说：“从前我们只是看人家的画，现在我们也看自己的画了。”这时候为了迎接人民公社的成立，各大队都像办喜事一样，扎彩门，粉墙壁，写诗，画画。画笔不够，就用菁麻扎，没有石灰就自己烧，没有颜料就用红土，会构图的构图，会涂色的涂色，会编的动口，会写的动手。连六十五岁的王大娘也动手写诗，还鼓励儿子、孙子写诗，画画，成为“诗画之家”。就这样，我们公社的诗画创作很快普遍开展起来了。社员们看到这么多诗画曾编歌唱道：“家家粉墙作诗画，五色彩旗遍地插，锣鼓喧天齐歌唱，迎接人民公社化。”
    但是，起初诗画创作没有开展的时候，有个别做文化工作的干部，他看不起我们农民，不相信我们能够写诗画画，有人甚至说：“一腿牛屎冲子，能画个啥，不要把墙弄脏了。”大家当然不听这套泄气话，还是大胆画起来。就说杨凤江吧，他讨过几十年饭，他看到小学教师在墙上画的竞赛栏，只画几道杠杠，挺不得劲，他拿起笔来就添上几朵花；他的老婆李素兰看见了，走上去拿起笔来说：“让我也来画。”于是一个在东墙画，一个在西墙画，两人一口气画了几幅画。杨凤江画了一幅《活捉美国狼》，李素兰接着画了一幅《荷花》，题的诗是：“一年四季荷花开，夫妻画画放满街，年过四十正当时，花开季节永不败。”后来，那些不相信农民能画画的人思想也转变了。
    1959年初，公社党委告诉我们要多配合中心工作画画，大家听了劲头更大了。这年春季大生产运动刚开始，大家就画出了《八字宪法》和《1959年生产指标》的组画。造肥积肥运动正在开展，大家就画出了许多宣传积肥的画。我也画了一张，我听说四川山多，我就画了很多肥堆，一堆堆像山一样矗到云端，肥堆中间画个人，题了一首诗：“出门三日把家还，疑惑错走到四川，此处若是淮北地，为何遍地都是山。”这幅画贴出去以后，可起了一些作用。花木兰队队长徐士芳看了就说：“嗬，我们要能堆这么多肥料，明年准能增产更多的粮食。”一下午，她们花木兰队就堆了六十五堆肥料。党号召全面发展农业生产，大家很快就画出了宣传发展粮、油、麻、蚕、糖、茶等十二业的组画。大家见了编诗称赞说：“粮油棉麻和丝茶，烟糖果菜代药杂，毛主席指示十二字，字字把它画成画，画上画，记心下，人人看见劲头大。”党号召发展畜牧业，大家就画出了《十畜兴旺》的画。党号召大力发展养猪，大家就画出了宣传养猪的画。今年4月省委提出了实现水产化，大家听到以后，马上就画出了《公社发展搞水产，水底有鱼水上莲，茭果芡实齐繁殖，菱角丛生水无闲》的画。
    总之，党的中心工作是什么，我们的画就大力宣传什么。今年快要午收的时候，大家又根据公社党委对于午收的要求，画了《快收快打》，《颗粒还家》，《边收边种》，《夏种莫耽搁》等一套套的诗画牌，插在路边和麦地上。这些画起了很大作用；一方面反映了群众在生产中的冲天干劲，更进一步鼓舞了群众的干劲；一方面具体地宣传了党的方针政策和任务。社员们看了这些画都很满意，并且说：“如今做事不要问，诗画事事说分明，方针任务和政策，照着做了定能行。”我们的诗画创作也紧密地配合了政治斗争，发挥了战斗作用。
    两年来，我们公社的诗画创作，一方面是开展的快，开展的普遍；一方面又是不断地向前发展和不断地提高。就说我自己吧，这两年来，在党的领导和培养下，也有一些进步。我原来根本不会画画，也没有拿过画笔。开始先画技术上墙。虽说农作物都是死的东西，我们一天见到晚，可画起来也不容易，画山芋叶子就想不起山芋叶子具体是啥样子。我就拔棵山芋来比着画。慢慢地这些农作物的特征我都掌握了，画起来就容易下手，而且也画得比较活了。可是人物还是不会画，比例也掌握不好，不是胳膊长了，就是腿短了。走路的样子，拿东西的样子，生产劳动的样子也画不好。咋办呢？后来我就找我老婆做样子比着给我画，譬如画劳动，我就叫我老婆拿锄头摆一个劳动姿势。她不愿干，我就说好话：“为了宣传，为了工作，你帮个忙吧。”后来次数多了，她又不干了，我又叫我的小孩比着给我画，小孩听话，事又不多，可以让我一次二次三次地画。慢慢地我就学会了画人物。比例和透视也都学会了一点。当然，我们学得还很不够，今后还要继续努力。
    这两年来，我们不但在画画技巧上有一些提高，更重要的是，我们在党的教育下，政治水平提高了，因而在题材的选择和表现能力上也有了提高。一次我看到社里棉花长得一人多高，棉桃又白又大，我就画了一幅表现棉花大丰收的画，画了一块一望无边的棉田，采棉姑娘只露个辫梢。并题了一首诗：“改良棉花赛白云，桃大枝稠棵儿深，姑娘采棉口唱歌，光听歌声不见人。”社员们看了都说：“我们的丰产棉田叫你搬到纸上来啦。”党委书记也说这幅画比过去提高了。
    现在，我们公社已经有三万四千多人参加诗画创作，两年来共计创作民歌一千二百六十八万首，创作诗画四百一十四万多幅。这么多人写诗画画，写了这么多诗，画了这么多的画，大家非常高兴，社员们编了一首歌说：“过去俺们是白丁，如今变成文武通，又会作诗又会画，墙上画的满堂红。”说到我们公社的生产，在党的领导下，大跃进以来，实现了河网化，实现了水稻化，粮食产量也不断得到提高。“力争生产诗画双丰收，立下功劳上北京。”这就是我们公社全体社员的愿望。
