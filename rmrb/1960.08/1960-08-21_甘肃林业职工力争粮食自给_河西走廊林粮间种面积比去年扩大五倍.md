Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou News. Guided by the idea that the national economy is based on agriculture, forestry workers in Gansu Province are vigorously carrying out intercropping of trees and grain, striving for grain self-sufficiency in forestry areas.

Starting last year, forestry workers across the province began to develop agricultural and animal husbandry production through intercropping of trees and grain, based on the development policy of "focusing on forestry and diversifying operations." In February of this year, the Provincial Forestry Bureau, based on the idea that the national economy should be based on agriculture, made specific plans to achieve self-sufficiency in grain, oil, meat, and vegetables within two years. Workers in state-owned tree farms, forest farms, and enterprises directly under the Provincial Bureau immediately launched a new high tide of production focusing on forestry, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and vigorously developing diversified operations. According to statistics from 149 state-owned tree farms, 128 forest farms, and 282 units directly under the Provincial Bureau and Province, they have currently planted more than 42,500 mu of grain crops, more than 6,200 mu of oil crops, more than 5,000 mu of vegetables, raised more than 4,700 pigs, more than 8,500 sheep, and also raised bees, fish, and various poultry.

Forestry workers in various regions, while vigorously carrying out intercropping of trees and grain and striving for grain self-sufficiency, are adapting to local conditions and relying on their own efforts. More than 14,000 workers in 16 forest farms under the Bai Long River and Tao River Forestry Bureaus directly under the province have made full use of the open spaces in the forest area, reclaiming and planting, sowing more than 19,000 mu. State-owned tree farms throughout the province, in conjunction with greening and water and soil conservation, have intercropped more than 11,100 mu of grain, oil, and vegetables in young forest land, solving the problem of insufficient cultivated land. The staff, students, and faculty of the Provincial Forestry Bureau, Forestry School, and Forest Resources Survey Team have made use of barren mountains, slopes, and vacant land in front of and behind houses, using every available space to establish grain, oil, vegetable, and feed bases of more than 7,100 mu, all sown on time. Various forest farms have also adopted methods such as "sending out, inviting in," and "taking old farmers as teachers" to learn production management techniques. In terms of animal husbandry, the principle of "self-breeding and self-raising" is implemented, and the method of keeping every mother is adopted to solve the problem of breeding stock.

This newspaper reports that people's commune forest farms and state-owned forest farms in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province are vigorously carrying out field management of intercropped crops. Since April 21st, the entire area has intercropped more than 20,000 mu of grain, oilseeds, feed, and vegetable crops in forests, an increase of more than fivefold compared to last year's intercropping area.

Managing both forests and grain together is a good way to increase grain production and accelerate the high yield of trees. For many years, the people's communes in the Hexi area, in their long-term struggle against wind and sand and drought, have gained rich experience in preventing wind and sand, conserving water and soil, and intercropping trees and grain, achieving remarkable results in promoting tree production and increasing grain production. In the past, 19 forestry communes and teams in the area, through intercropping trees and grain, managing both forests and grain together, and reforming other farming systems, have now achieved a grain surplus. For example, the Yongyuan Brigade of the Luocheng People's Commune in Gaotai has built more than 24,000 mu of windbreak and sand-fixation forests along the edge of the desert. Cultivated land has expanded from 1,900 mu in 1949 to 3,322 mu. They have consistently adhered to the management of both forests and grain, so that the survival rate of young trees has reached more than 90%, and grain yield per mu has increased several times, transforming from a grain-deficient team to a grain-surplus team. Before last year, of the more than 40 state-owned forest farms established throughout the area, 19 had achieved self-sufficiency in grain, oil, meat, and vegetables, and 28 were half self-sufficient. Because the grain problem has been basically solved, these forest farms have promoted the high-speed development of forestry production. Minqin County has carried out large-scale afforestation and large-scale intercropping of forests and grain, digging 3,500 wells in forest land and building 50 canals to ensure irrigation and water conservancy for 100,000 mu of forest land. They have also established 193 commune-run forest farms, fixing 3,550 laborers to manage the forest land in the forest-grain intercropping area. The more than 100,000 mu of sand jujube forests they built in the autumn of 1958 are generally as high as three or four feet, twice as high as trees that have not been intercropped with grain.

### 甘肃林业职工力争粮食自给  河西走廊林粮间种面积比去年扩大五倍

    甘肃林业职工力争粮食自给
    河西走廊林粮间种面积比去年扩大五倍
    新华社兰州讯　甘肃省林业系统职工在国民经济以农业为基础的思想指导下，大搞林、粮间作，力争林区粮食自给。
    从去年开始，全省林业职工就根据“以林为主，多种经营”的发展方针，着手进行林粮间作发展农牧业生产。今年2月，省林业局根据国民经济以农业为基础的思想，作出了在两年内分别实现粮、油、肉、菜自给的具体规划。全省国营造林场、森林林场和省局直属企业等单位职工，立即掀起以林为主，农牧结合，大搞多种经营的生产新高潮。据一百四十九个国营造林场、一百二十八个森林林场和省局、省直属企业共二百八十二个单位的统计，目前已种粮食作物四万二千五百多亩，油料六千二百多亩，蔬菜五千多亩，养猪四千七百多头，养羊八千五百多只，还养了蜂、鱼和各种家禽。
    各地林业职工在大搞林粮间作，争取粮食自给中因地制宜，自力更生。省直属白龙江、洮河林业局十六个森林林场的一万四千多名职工，充分利用林区空隙地，边垦边种，播种了一万九千多亩。全省各国营造林场结合绿化和水土保持，在幼林地间种粮、油、菜一万一千一百多亩，解决了耕地不足问题。省林业局、林业学校和林野调查队的职工、师生，利用荒山、荒坡和房前屋后的空闲地，见缝插针，建立粮、油、菜和饲料基地七千一百多亩，全部按时下种。各林场还采取“派出去，请进来”、“拜老农为师”等办法，学习生产管理技术。在畜牧方面，贯彻“自繁自养”方针，采取见母必留的办法，解决了种源问题。
    本报讯　甘肃河西走廊各人民公社林场和国营林场，大搞林粮间种作物的田间管理。全区从4月21日以来在林间间作粮食、油料、饲料和蔬菜作物二万多亩，比去年间作面积扩大五倍以上。
    林粮齐管是增产粮食，加速林木丰产的好办法。多少年来，河西人民公社和风沙干旱的长期斗争中，曾取得防治风沙，保持水土，间种林粮的丰富经验，对促进林木生产和增产粮食都获得了显著效果。过去全区有十九个林区社、队，通过林粮间作，林粮齐管和其他耕作制度的改革，现在做到粮食自给有余。如高台罗城人民公社永远大队沿沙漠边缘营造防风固沙林二万四千多亩，耕地由1949年一千九百亩扩大到三千三百二十二亩，一直坚持林粮齐管，使幼林成活率达90％以上，粮食亩产成倍增长，从缺粮队变为余粮队。全专区去年以前建立的四十多个国营林场，有十九个达到粮、油、肉、菜自足，有二十八个半自给。这些林场由于粮食问题基本解决，从而促进了林业生产的高速度发展。民勤县大面积造林，大面积林粮间作，林地打井三千五百眼，修渠五十条，保证十万亩林地实现灌溉水利化，还建立了一百九十三个社队办林场，固定三千五百五十个劳动力在林粮间作区管理林地，他们在1958年秋季营造的十多万亩沙枣林，一般已经高达三四尺，比没有间种粮食的林木高出一倍。
