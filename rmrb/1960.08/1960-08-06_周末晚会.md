Weekend Evening Party

　　Weekend. The members of the Qianmen People's Commune, having completed a week of production tasks, returned home in a cheerful mood, dressed their children neatly, and put on their new clothes, flocking from the streets and alleys to a nearby cultural center.

　　The cultural center's venue was not small, but the seats and sidewalks were crowded with people. After the announcer announced the Ping Opera "Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law Praise the Commune" program, the red curtain was drawn, and a young daughter-in-law in a floral blouse and green trousers immediately appeared on the stage. With a smiling face, she danced and sang along with the melodious music:

　　"The song of the Great Leap Forward resounds throughout the city, the song of happiness is sung with even more joy, the People's Commune has been established on the streets, the women are blooming with joy!" ...

　　When the actress finished singing the first verse, a burst of warm applause immediately erupted from the audience.

　　"Sister, when did our mother learn to sing opera?" This was the voice of seven-year-old boy Su Jian sitting in the audience. At first, he was as excited as everyone else, clapping his little hands; but when he discovered that the actress on the stage was his own mother, he immediately stood up from his seat, asking his twelve-year-old sister sitting next to him in surprise and joy.

　　The actress playing the daughter-in-law, named Liu Xiuzeng, is the director of the cardboard box workshop in the Luanging Processing Factory of the Qianmen People's Commune. She is a worker's family member with five children, and she had never sung Ping Opera at home before. After participating in commune production, she became fond of cultural activities and became an active member of the commune's amateur art troupe. When she finished performing this opera and heard everyone's praise, she smiled radiantly and said to everyone, "Since I participated in production, I really feel like I am getting younger and younger, and I am so happy that I want to sing on stage!"

    周末晚会
    周末。前门人民公社的社员们完成了一周的生产任务，怀着愉快的心情回到家里，把孩子们打扮得干干净净，自己也穿上了新衣裳，纷纷从大街小巷赶到附近的一个文化馆。
    文化馆会场不算小，可是座位上、人行道上都挤满了人。当报幕员报完评剧“婆媳夸公社”的节目以后，红色的幕布一拉开，台上立刻出现一个穿着花小衫绿裤子的年轻媳妇。她随着悠扬的琴声，满面笑容地边舞边唱：
    “满城响遍跃进歌，幸福歌越唱越乐呵，街道上成立了人民公社，妇女们心花怒放好快活！”……
    当演员唱完第一段曲子，场下立刻响起了一阵热烈的掌声。
    “姐姐，咱妈什么时候学会唱戏的？”这是坐在台下的七岁男孩苏健的声音。开初，他也同大家一样地激动，拍着小手；可是当他发现台上的演员就是自己的妈妈的时候，他立刻从座位上站了起来，又惊又喜地打问坐在他旁边的十二岁的小姐姐。
    台上扮演媳妇的演员，叫刘秀增，是前门人民公社銮庆加工厂纸盒车间主任。她是有五个孩子的职工家属，过去在家时从来也没有唱过评戏。参加公社生产以后，才爱好上文娱活动，并且成为公社业余文工团的积极分子。当她演完这出戏，听到大家的赞扬，她满面春风地笑着对大家说：“我从参加生产以后，自己真觉得越活越年轻了，心里高兴，就想登台唱唱！”
