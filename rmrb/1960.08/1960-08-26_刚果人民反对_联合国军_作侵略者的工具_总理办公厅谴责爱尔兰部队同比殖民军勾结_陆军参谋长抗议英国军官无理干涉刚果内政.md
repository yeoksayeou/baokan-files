Xinhua News Agency, August 25th dispatch from Léopoldville: The office of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba issued a communique on the 24th condemning the "UN Forces'" Irish troops for colluding with Belgian aggressor forces, and stating that Belgian paratroopers stationed in Ruanda-Urundi were threatening the eastern border of the Congo.

The communique said that the people of Goma, Kivu Province, Congo, demanded that Congolese troops replace the "UN Forces'" Irish troops there, "only Congolese troops can guarantee the withdrawal of Belgian soldiers from this area."

The communique said, "The European troops of the UN Forces (the Irish) are friendly with the Belgian paratrooper commandos."

It is reported that in Albertville, northern Katanga Province, Congo, Belgian colonial forces, the Katanga provincial reactionary authorities, and the "UN Forces" have established a joint "committee" to suppress the patriotic struggle of the Congolese people there.

News reports that a batch of Irish troops from the "UN Forces" flew to Albertville on the 24th to replace the Malian troops of the "UN Forces."

A "UN" spokesman openly announced on the 24th, "The United Nations Emergency Force participating in operations in the Congo has the right to use force against armed attacks." He also said, "This order also includes dealing with attempts to use force to compel UN forces to withdraw from the positions they occupy under orders." The commander of a detachment of the "UN Forces," the Briton Alexander, publicly expressed remarks in London on the 23rd interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo. He said that he believed the Congolese army should be "disbanded" and that these troops "should eventually be retrained under the leadership of the United Nations."

Xinhua News Agency, August 24th dispatch from Léopoldville: Congolese Army Chief of Staff Colonel Mobutu protested on the 22nd against a British officer of the "UN Forces" for interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo. This British officer ordered the troops under his command to prevent the Congolese constabulary from arresting colonialists attempting to flee the Congo.

On the 22nd, the Congolese constabulary arrested seven colonialists at the Léopoldville airport, the capital of the Congo, who were attempting to flee to Brazzaville. Prior to this, four "UN Forces" soldiers stood guard near the escalators for boarding and disembarking planes, attempting to obstruct the arrest. Thirty Congolese constabulary reinforcements surrounded the "UN Forces" soldiers, ordering them to leave their posts and not interfere with the Congolese constabulary exercising its duties. However, in order to protect the colonialists, the "UN Forces" brazenly dispatched about sixty additional troops, arranging three machine guns on the ground in front of the Congolese constabulary to threaten them.

Later, Congolese Army Chief of Staff Mobutu personally arrived at the scene and protested to the British officer of the "UN Forces" who was in command at the time.

It is reported that the actions of the "UN Forces" in the Congo are increasingly being opposed by Congolese soldiers. In Luluabourg, the capital of Kasai Province, Congolese soldiers arrested a Belgian pilot of a "UN" plane. In Stanleyville, the capital of Orientale Province, several "UN personnel" (Canadians) were also briefly detained.

Despite this, the "UN" continues to send more troops to the Congo. A "UN" spokesman said in Léopoldville on the 23rd that the "UN Forces" currently in the Congo have increased to approximately 17,000.

According to another report, the Congo has established a military commission led by Prime Minister Lumumba. The report also said that Lumumba has requested that the commander of the Moroccan army of the "UN Forces" stationed in the Congo, Kitani, serve as an advisor to the military commission.

    刚果人民反对“联合国军”作侵略者的工具
    总理办公厅谴责爱尔兰部队同比殖民军勾结
    陆军参谋长抗议英国军官无理干涉刚果内政
    据新华社25日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴的办公厅24日发表公报，谴责“联合国军”的爱尔兰部队同比利时侵略军相勾结；并且说，驻在卢安达—乌隆迪的比利时伞兵威胁刚果东部边境。
    这项公报说，刚果基伍省果马人民要求用刚果军队来替换那里的“联合国军”爱尔兰军队，“只有刚果军队能保证比利时士兵撤出这一地区”。
    公报说，“联合国军的欧洲军队（爱尔兰人）同比利时伞兵突击队友好。”
    据报道，在刚果加丹加省北部阿耳伯特维尔，比利时殖民军、加丹加省反动当局和“联合国军”已经成立了一个共同“委员会”，以镇压那里刚果人民的爱国斗争。
    消息说，“联合国军”的一批爱尔兰部队24日飞往阿耳伯特维尔，来代替“联合国军”马里部队。
    “联合国”在刚果的一个发言人24日公然宣布，“在刚果参加行动的联合国紧急部队有权利用武力对付武装进攻。”他又说，“这一命令还包括对付这种企图：用武力迫使联合国军撤出他们根据命令占据的阵地。”“联合国军”一支分遣队的司令英国人亚历山大23日在伦敦公开发表干涉刚果内政的言论。他说，他认为刚果军队应当“解散”，这些军队“最后应在联合国领导下重新加以训练”。
    新华社24日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果陆军参谋长蒙博托上校22日抗议“联合国军”的一个英国军官干涉刚果内政。这个英国军官命令他指挥下的军队阻止刚果宪兵逮捕企图逃出刚果的殖民者。
    刚果宪兵22日在刚果首都利奥波德维尔机场逮捕了七名企图逃往布拉柴维尔的殖民者。在这之前，四名“联合国军”士兵在上下飞机的扶梯附近站岗，企图阻挠这次逮捕。增援的三十名刚果宪兵包围了这些“联合国军”士兵，并且命令他们离开岗位，和不要干涉刚果宪兵行使职权。但自己为了保护殖民者，“联合国军”悍然增派大约六十名军队，他们在刚果宪兵面前的地上排列了三挺机关枪，进行威胁。
    后来，刚果陆军参谋长蒙博托亲自赶到现场，并向当时在场指挥的“联合国军”英国军官提出抗议。
    据报道，“联合国军”在刚果的行动，愈来愈多地遭到刚果士兵的反对。在开赛省省会路路阿堡，刚果士兵逮捕了一架“联合国”飞机的比利时驾驶员。在东方省省会斯坦利维尔，也有几个“联合国人员”（加拿大人）一度被拘留。
    尽管如此，“联合国”继续增派军队前往刚果。一个“联合国”发言人23日在利奥波德维尔说，目前在刚果的“联合国军”已经增加到约有一万七千人。
    据另一消息报道，刚果成立了由卢蒙巴总理领导的军事委员会。消息还说，卢蒙巴已要求由驻刚果“联合国军”的摩洛哥军司令基塔尼任军事委员会的顾问。
