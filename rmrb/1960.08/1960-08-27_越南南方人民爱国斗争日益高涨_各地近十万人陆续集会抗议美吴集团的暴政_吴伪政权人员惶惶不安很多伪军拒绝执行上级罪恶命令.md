Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 25th: According to the "People's Daily" today, quoting news from South Vietnam, the struggle of the South Vietnamese people against US imperialism and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, is rising daily. In recent months, dozens of rallies against the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique have been held in many places, with nearly 100,000 people participating. These rallies opposed repression and "suing communists," demanded the abolition of the fascist Decree No. 10 of 1959, opposed land grabbing and tax increases, opposed conscription and forced labor, and demanded the dissolution of "agrovilles."

In Cai Be district, My Tho province, more than 4,000 people from various villages held a rally in the town to condemn the crimes of the US-Ngo clique and demanded the dissolution of the "agrovilles." When the people arrived at the district "government," the district chief ordered the "security forces" and police to suppress them; but in the face of the people's power, some security forces and police refused to carry out the order. As a result, the district chief was forced to promise that he would no longer conscript or force labor and would guarantee that the people could work peacefully at home.

In My Phu Tay village, Cai Lay district, My Tho province, 1,200 people held a rally on April 21 to oppose the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's forced construction of a road from the My Phu Tay "agrovilles" to the Phat Thach temple in Zhoucheng district. People shouted slogans such as "Down with the US-Ngo clique." In Zhoucheng district, more than 2,000 people held a rally in mid-May to oppose the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's forced construction of a road along the My Phu-Yang Wen Yang canal. People shouted slogans such as "Resolutely go home" and "Resolutely do not dig canals and build roads for the US-Ngo clique." Thousands of rally participants angrily destroyed the roads and canals that the US-Ngo clique had forced them to build, destroyed tools and camps, and returned home together.

Tens of thousands of farmers in various districts of My Tho province also resolutely rose up to reclaim the land they had been allocated during the War of Resistance. In Zhoucheng, Meishi, and Cai Be districts alone, more than 3,000 farmers reclaimed more than 2,000 mu of land. They also demanded opposition to auctions and reduction and exemption of land rent on 1,500 mu of public land.

In Thua Thien province, from cities to rural areas, even in barracks and police bunkers, leaflets exposing the US-Ngo fascist system appeared everywhere.

The news said that in Quang Ngai province, people were forced to rise up heroically to oppose the "sweeps" and forced concentration crimes of the US-Ngo clique. When the US-Ngo clique carried out "sweeps," some soldiers fell into the traps dug by ethnic minorities and suffered heavy casualties.

According to a Western news agency report on the 24th, recently, in Saigon, the so-called "government" seat of the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique, mass demonstrations against the Ngo Dinh Diem clique broke out.

The news said that the demonstrators came to Saigon from outside the city. They carried banners and leaflets opposing the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. Their slogans were: "Down with the clan government, abolish exorbitant taxes and levies, and support patriots."

According to reports, these people demonstrated to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the "August Revolution" victory in Vietnam on August 1945. On August 19, 1945, the people of Hanoi revolted and seized power from the Japanese army, establishing a revolutionary provisional government. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique called this day a "Viet Minh coup" and forbade the people from celebrating.

News said that from the night of August 18 to the 24th, the South Vietnamese authorities had arrested more than 30 people in Saigon.

According to the "People's Daily," in the face of the heroic struggle of the people in the southern provinces, the personnel of the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet regime are anxious and uneasy all day long. Many people have resigned, and many have had to confess their crimes to the people. Some of the US-Ngo clique's troops participating in the "sweeps" sympathized with the people and refused to carry out the criminal orders of their superiors.

    越南南方人民爱国斗争日益高涨
    各地近十万人陆续集会抗议美吴集团的暴政
    吴伪政权人员惶惶不安很多伪军拒绝执行上级罪恶命令
    新华社河内25日电　据“人民报”今天援引来自南越的消息说，越南南方人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团的斗争日益高涨。最近几个月在很多地方举行了数十次反美国—吴庭艳集团的集会，有近十万人参加了这些集会。反对镇压、“诉共”，要求取消1959年第十号法西斯法令，反对夺佃、增税，反对抓伕、拉丁和要求解散“稠密区”。
    美萩省丐?郡各乡有四千多人，曾在市镇举行集会，谴责美吴集团的罪行，并要求解散后美“稠密区”。当人民来到郡“政府”时，郡长下令“保安队”和警察进行镇压；但在人民的威力面前，一些保安队和警察拒绝执行命令。结果，郡长被迫答应不再抓伕、拉丁，保证人民在家安心工作。
    美萩省盖雷的美福西乡，一千二百人在4月21日举行集会，反对美国—吴庭艳集团强迫人民修筑从美福西“稠密区”到州成郡佛石寺的公路。人民高呼“打倒美吴集团”等口号。在州成郡，二千多人在5月中旬举行集会，反对吴庭艳集团强迫人民修筑美福—杨文扬运河的公路，人民高呼“坚决回家去”、“坚决不为美吴集团挖运河和筑路”。成千集会的人民愤怒地破坏了美吴集团强迫他们修筑的公路和运河，并破坏了工具和营地，一起返回家去。
    美萩省各郡的成万农民还坚决起来夺回在抗战期间所分到的土地。只在州成、米市和丐?三个郡内，三千多农民就夺回了二千亩田地，他们还提出反对拍卖和要求减免一千五百亩公田的地租的要求。
    在承天省，从城市到农村，甚至在兵营和警察的碉堡上，到处都出现揭露美吴法西斯制度的传单。
    消息说，在广义省，人民被迫起来英勇地反对美吴集团的“扫荡”和强迫集中的罪行。美吴集团进行“扫荡”时，有些士兵陷入少数民族挖掘的陷井中，遭到很大伤亡。
    据西方通讯社24日报道，最近，在吴庭艳卖国集团的所谓“政府”所在地西贡，爆发了人民群众反对吴庭艳集团的示威游行。
    消息说，示威群众是从市外来到西贡的。他们拿着反对吴庭艳集团的标语和传单。他们的口号是：“打倒氏族政府，废除苛捐杂税，支持爱国人士。”
    据报道，这些人示威是为了纪念“八——九”越南八月革命胜利十五周年。1945年8月19日，河内人民起义从日军手中夺取政权，成立了革命临时政府。但是，吴庭艳卖国集团却把这个日子称为“越盟政变”；不准人民庆祝。
    有消息说，自8月18日夜间到24日，南越当局已在西贡逮捕了三十多人。
    据“人民报”报道，在南方各省人民英勇斗争的威势面前，吴庭艳伪政权人员终日惶惶不安，很多人已经辞职，很多人不得不向人民认罪。一些参加“扫荡”的美吴集团军队同情人民，不肯执行他们上级的罪恶的命令。
