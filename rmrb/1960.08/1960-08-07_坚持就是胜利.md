Persistence is Victory

New things replacing old things is an objective law of development independent of people's will. Recognizing and grasping this law will inevitably strengthen our confidence that new things will surely triumph. The technical revolution movement of the relay factory, from a spark to a prairie fire, from simplicity to complexity, and then to refinement, is a process of continuous growth, improvement, and victory for new things. The growth of any new thing is not always smooth sailing. In its growth process, it is always filled with the struggle between two worldviews and two roads: the new and the old, the advanced and the backward, the revolutionary and the non-revolutionary. True revolutionaries should not only be good at keenly discovering new things, but more importantly, protect the seedlings of new things and support their growth, and at the same time, dare to wage uncompromising struggles against the old forces that harm new things. After all thirteen hexagonal lathes in the automated workshop of the relay factory achieved automatic program control, seven of them could be used freely, increasing efficiency by one to several times. However, the remaining six lathes would stop and start intermittently, and were not even "sensitive," so that production efficiency was not only not improved, but even lower than in the past. At this time, some people who were accustomed to looking at problems from superficial phenomena said, "It's a waste of effort," and they advocated restoring the old methods. Thus, a struggle between two worldviews, "going back or not" and "advancing or retreating," unfolded. At this time, the Party committee of the relay factory, following the direction pointed out by the Party, stood tall and saw far. They went deep into the front line, studied, explored, and discussed with the masses, carefully observed, and keenly discerned, discovering a thought-provoking question. This is why seven lathes are easy to use. They believed that since there is one that is easy to use, there can be one hundred, or even more, that are easy to use. From these seven automatic lathes that could be used freely, they got inspiration and saw the infinite vitality contained in new things. Therefore, with an unswerving attitude, they resolutely did not go back, believing that the new will surely overcome the old. This was not blind optimism in the face of difficulties, but rather grasping the essence of things. This fact shows that the growth and strengthening of new things requires every innovator to have a tenacious and unyielding revolutionary spirit. That is to say, at any time, we must breathe together and share the fate with new things, and faithfully and constantly clear the way for the growth of new things.

A single spark can start a prairie fire. If the direction is right, persistence is victory. Persistence is a process of constantly recognizing and mastering objective laws, so that objective laws can be utilized and serve the people. We must firmly remember the ancients' saying, "Building a mountain nine仞, failing to achieve success for lack of one basket," and whether we can persist to the end is often the key to determining the success or failure of the revolutionary cause, no matter what we do. In the current technical revolution movement centered on the "Four Modernizations," a large number of new technologies, new processes, and new experiences have emerged. We must not only give full support to these new things, but also implement them throughout, so that all new things can fully display their infinite power and quickly blossom and bear fruit. Since technological innovation and technological revolution themselves are not the goal, and their purpose is to improve productivity and promote a substantial increase in production, then we should not at any time only have the false reputation of innovation and creation, but strive for practical production results. If we do not fully utilize and develop the many new technologies we have created, we are bound to be "ninety miles is only half of a hundred-mile journey," and cannot achieve the true purpose of the technical revolution. It should be seen that after a new technology or new experience is adhered to and promoted, it will inevitably be continuously enriched, developed, and improved. Of course, new things always have imperfections when they first appear. At this time, the responsibility of revolutionaries is to show the most thorough revolutionary spirit, to bravely insist on revolutionizing all old technologies and habitual forces, so that a large number of new technologies can be continuously upgraded and improved. This is the manifestation of the thoroughness of the proletarian revolution in the technical revolution, and it is an important guarantee for the continuous victory of the technical revolution. This thorough revolutionary spirit prominently demonstrates the subjective initiative of people. On this issue, the comrades of the relay factory have the experience that whether it is possible to persist in consolidating, promoting, developing, and improving all the achievements of new technologies depends on whether a revolutionary has a true revolutionary sense of responsibility and a spirit of perseverance. Treat the existing new technologies and new things, be sure to make it strive for practical results, and persist to the end, and never have any ambiguity or halfway.

    坚持就是胜利
    新事物代替旧事物，这是不以人们意志为转移的客观发展规律。认识和掌握了这个规律，就必然会增强我们对新事物一定要胜利的信心。继电器厂技术革命运动，从星星之火，到势如燎原，从简单到复杂，再到精练的过程，就是新生事物不断成长、完善和胜利的过程。任何新生事物的成长都不是一帆风顺的。在它的成长过程中，始终充满着新与旧、先进与落后、革命与不革命的两种世界观、两条道路的斗争。真正革命者不仅要善于锐敏地发现新生事物，而更重要的是要保护新生事物幼芽和支持它成长壮大，同时，敢于同危害新生事物的旧势力作不妥协的斗争。继电器厂自动化车间，十三台六角车床全部实现自动程序控制之后，有七台能运用自如，提高效率一倍至数倍，可是余下的六台则干干停停，甚至用而不“灵”，生产效率不仅没有提高，反倒比过去降低了。这时一些习惯从事物表面现象看问题的人，便说，“白费力气了”，他们主张恢复老一套的干法。于是，一场“走不走回头路”“前进与后退”的两种世界观的斗争展开了。就在这时，继电器厂党委遵循党指明的方向，站得高，看得远，他们深入第一线，同群众一起研究、摸索、商量，精心地观察，锐敏地辨别，发现一个令人深思的问题。这就是为什么有七台车床好使，他们相信，既然有一个好使的，就能有一百个、甚而更多好使的。就从这七台能运用自如的自动车床上，他们得到了启示，看到了新生事物蕴藏着无限的生命力，因此，他们抱着坚定不移的态度，坚决不走回头路，相信新的一定能胜过旧的。这不是他们在困难面前盲目乐观，而是把握住了事物的本质。这一事实说明了新生事物的成长、壮大，要求每个革新者都要有顽强不屈、坚持到底的革命精神。也就是说，在任何时候，都要与新生事物同呼吸、共命运，忠实地不断地为新生事物成长扫清道路。
    星星之火，可以燎原。方向对头，坚持就是胜利。坚持就是不断认识和掌握客观规律的过程，使客观规律为人们所利用，为人们服务。我们要牢牢地记住前人的“为山九仞，功亏一篑”的道理，不论做什么事情，能否坚持到最后，往往是决定革命事业成败的关键。在当前以“四化”为中心的技术革命运动中，出现了大量新技术、新工艺、新经验等新事物，这些新事物我们要不仅给予全力支持，而且还要贯彻始终，使所有的新生事物都能充分显示它的无穷威力，都能迅速开花结果。既然技术革新和技术革命本身不是目的，它的目的是提高生产力促进生产大幅度增长，那么我们在任何时候都不应该徒具革新创造的虚名，要力求生产实效。我们创造的许多新技术，如果不去充分运用它、发展它，势必是“行百里者半九十”，不能达到技术革命的真正目的。应当看到，一件新技术、新经验坚持和推广之后，就必然会不断地得到丰富、发展、提高。当然，新事物刚一出现时，总会有不完善的地方。在这时候，革命者的责任就是拿出最彻底的革命精神，勇于坚持革一切旧技术和习惯势力的命，使大量新技术不断升级、不断地完善起来，这是无产阶级革命彻底性在技术革命上的表现，是技术革命不断赢得胜利的重要保证。这种彻底的革命精神，突出地表现出了人的主观能动性。在这个问题上，继电器厂同志们的体会是，能否坚持巩固、推广、发展、提高一切新技术的成果，关键在于一个革命者有没有真正的革命事业心，有没有坚持到底的精神。对待已出现的新技术、新事物，一定让它力求实效，坚持到底，而绝不能有半点含糊和半途而止。（摘自“哈尔滨日报”）
