Xinhua News Agency, August 12th, Leopoldville News: To combat the rumors and slanders against the Congo spread by the Belgian colonial propaganda machine, the Congolese government took over the branch office of the Belgian News Agency in the Congo on the 11th and prepared to establish a Congolese news agency.

On the afternoon of that day, Congolese Minister of Information Kashamura personally went to the Leopoldville office of the Belgian News Agency, announced the Congolese government's decision to have Congolese people take over the news agency, and ordered that "the activities of the Belgian News Agency be suspended until an agreement is reached with relevant Congolese private parties." According to reports, two telex machines in the agency's office in the Congolese capital that sent messages to Brussels have been guarded by two Congolese policemen.

Sources say that the Congolese government also searched the "African Messenger," a newspaper run by Belgian colonists, arrested its editor-in-chief, Makoso, and confiscated the newspaper from August 1st. The Congolese government also banned the Belgian "European Magazine" from entering the country because it published messages that endangered Congolese national security. There are also reports that the Congolese government intends to expel some Western journalists who spread rumors.

Earlier, Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba had accused Belgian colonists of using newspapers to serve their acts of aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, August 11th, Bukavu News: Congolese troops in Kivu Province of the Congo are still persisting in the struggle against colonialism, refusing to lay down their arms to the "UN forces" sent there.

According to reports, in Lumangabo, between Goma and Lutchuru in the northern part of the province, the UN forces have been trying to induce the Congolese soldiers there to lay down their arms through "negotiations" for many days. However, 650 Congolese guards resolutely refused to hand over their weapons to the UN forces. It was previously reported that five or six days ago, the Congolese garrison there warned the UN forces not to take further action to disarm Congolese soldiers.

In Bukavu, the capital of Kivu Province, the Congolese soldiers there insisted on maintaining control of their weapons, despite the fact that the UN forces sent there have been trying in every possible way to disarm them for more than a week.

Xinhua News Agency, August 12th, Elisabethville News: UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, led 300 UN soldiers from Leopoldville, the capital of the Congo, to Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province of the Congo, this afternoon. He has been working hard in recent days to get the American-controlled "UN forces" into Katanga Province.

According to reports, when Hammarskjöld arrived in Elisabethville, he was welcomed by more than 200 European colonists. At the same time, local people held demonstrations. According to UPI, demonstrators held signs with slogans such as "Down with Hammarskjöld," "Down with Tshombe - Long Live Unified Congo." The Belgian government and the Tshombe group under its wings had firmly opposed the entry of the American-controlled "UN forces" into Katanga Province. Later, through strong pressure from the United States and Hammarskjöld's behind-the-scenes bargaining with the Belgian representative to the United Nations and the Tshombe side, Tshombe suddenly announced his agreement for the "UN forces" to enter Katanga and asked Hammarskjöld to go to Katanga in person for further "talks" with him. Tshombe triumphantly announced at a press conference on the evening of the 11th: "If we accept the United Nations troops, it is because we feel that we have been satisfied." Earlier that day, he also revealed in a telegram to Hammarskjöld that Hammarskjöld had expressed to him that through their two (Hammarskjöld and Tshombe) talks, Hammarskjöld would be able to issue instructions guaranteeing respect for the "territorial sovereignty and free exercise of its power" of the Tshombe "government."

    新华社12日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果政府为了打击比利时殖民者宣传机器对刚果的造谣和污蔑，11日接管了比利时通讯社在刚果的分社，并准备建立刚果人的通讯社。
    当天下午，刚果新闻部长卡沙谬拉亲自去到比利时通讯社在利奥波德维尔的办公处，宣布了刚果政府关于由刚果人接管这家通讯社的决定，并且命令说，“在取得刚果私人有关方面的协议以前，停止比利时通讯社的活动”。据报道，这家通讯社在刚果首都的办公处向布鲁塞尔发消息的两架电传机已由两名刚果警察看守起来。
    有消息说，刚果政府当天还搜查了比利时殖民者办的“非洲信使报”，逮捕了该报总编辑马科索，没收了该报自8月1日起的报纸。刚果政府并且禁止比利时的“欧洲杂志”入境，因为这家杂志登载危害刚果国家安全的消息。还有消息说，刚果政府打算驱逐一些造谣生事的西方记者出境。
    早些时候，刚果总理卢蒙巴曾指责比利时殖民者利用报纸来为他们的侵略暴行服务。
    新华社11日讯　布卡武消息：刚果基伍省的刚果军队仍在坚持反对殖民主义的斗争，拒绝向派往那里的“联合国军”放下武器。
    据报道，在这个省北部果马和卢楚胡鲁之间的卢曼加博，好多天来，联合国军一直试图通过“谈判”来诱迫那里的刚果士兵放下武器，但是，六百五十名刚果守军坚决不向联合国军交出武器。前已报道，五、六天以前，那里的刚果驻防部队曾警告联合国军不要采取解除刚果士兵武装的进一步行动。
    在基伍省省会布卡武，那里的刚果士兵坚持掌握着他们的武器，尽管一个多星期来，被派去的联合国军千方百计地在想解除他们的武装。
    新华社12日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，今天下午率领三百名联合国军从刚果首都利奥波德维尔飞抵刚果加丹加省省会伊利沙伯维尔。近日来他一直为使美国操纵的“联合国军”进入加丹加省而奔波。
    据报道，当哈马舍尔德到达伊利沙伯维尔时，受到二百多名欧洲殖民者的欢迎。在这同时，当地人民举行示威。据合众国际社消息，示威者举着“打倒哈马舍尔德”、“打倒冲伯——统一的刚果万岁”等标语牌。比利时政府和在它卵翼下的冲伯集团曾坚决反对美国操纵的“联合国军”开进加丹加省。后来，通过美国的强大压力以及哈马舍尔德同比利时驻联合国代表和冲伯方面幕后的讨价还价，冲伯突然宣布同意“联合国军”开进加丹加，并且要求哈马舍尔德亲自去加丹加同他作进一步的“会谈”。冲伯11日晚在记者招待会上洋洋得意地宣布：“如果我们接受联合国军队，那是因为我们感到我们已经得到满足。”同一天早些时候，他给哈马舍尔德的电报中也透露，哈马舍尔德曾向他表示：通过他们两人（哈马舍尔德和冲伯）的会谈，哈马舍尔德将能够发出保证尊重冲伯“政府”的“领土主权和自由行使它的权力”的指示。
