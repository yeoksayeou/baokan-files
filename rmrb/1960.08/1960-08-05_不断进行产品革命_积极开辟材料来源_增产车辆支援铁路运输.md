Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Electric Report: The Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, while completing its monthly plans this year, has also increased production for the country by forty-three locomotives and five hundred and two freight cars. The quality of both locomotives and freight cars has reached the national technical standards, strongly supporting railway transportation.

To increase vehicle production, the plant's Party committee mobilized workers to use indigenous methods to produce more than 110 kinds of urgently needed raw materials. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to collect more than 6,000 tons of scrap steel from within the factory, ensuring the production of cast steel parts. They also vigorously promoted the conservation and substitution of raw materials, cutting and piecing together, and rational use. In June, the state supplied them with raw materials to manufacture 180 freight cars, but due to their increased production and conservation of raw materials, they produced more than 500 cars, creating the highest monthly output record for the entire plant.

Dalian Locomotive Plant
Xinhua News Agency, Lüda Electric Report: The Dalian Locomotive Plant has continuously carried out product revolution. As of July 25, the plant's locomotive production this year increased by 86.3% compared with the same period last year, and freight car production increased by 17.2%.

In order to produce more locomotives, the plant mobilized the masses to vigorously carry out product revolution. They carried out the seventh reform of the "Construction Type" locomotive design. After the reform, the raw materials that originally made nine locomotives can now produce ten locomotives, while ensuring quality, and saving 25% of processing man-hours.

Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant
Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 4th Electric Report: Workers at the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant launched the "One Top Several" movement, consolidating, promoting, and improving the results of technical innovation, producing more vehicles and accessories to support railway transportation. In July, the plant comprehensively completed the national plan, increasing the production of locomotives and passenger cars by one each compared to the plan; road-use accessories exceeded the plan by more than 25%; the quality of all products reached the national standards. Currently, 90% of the plant's machine tools have achieved advanced experience matching, and production efficiency has increased by an average of 30%.

Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant
Xinhua News Agency, 4th Report: The Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant has overfulfilled its locomotive repair and new freight car construction plans every month for the first seven months of this year. After entering August, all employees of the plant are giving full play to their efforts and are determined to work hard for sixty days to overfulfill the production tasks for the third quarter.

August and September are the key months for the plant to overfulfill its annual plan. The workers are preparing to use a positive and balanced method, according to the supply of raw materials, to implement long-term plans and short-term arrangements every month, organize campaigns, concentrate their efforts to fight annihilation battles, and at the same time, in the spirit of self-reliance, vigorously produce steel and auxiliary materials to increase sources of materials.

Jiang'an Rolling Stock Plant
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th Electric Report: The Wuhan Jiang'an Rolling Stock Plant manufactured 11% more freight cars in July than in June.

Entering July, the Party committee of the Jiang'an Commune, where the Jiang'an Rolling Stock Plant is located, organized nine factories to produce parts and process iron parts for the Jiang'an Rolling Stock Plant. By the end of July, these factories had produced more than 16,000 forged parts, castings, and processed parts, and more than 130,000 screws, greatly promoting the leap in production at the Jiang'an Rolling Stock Plant.

Shijiazhuang Rolling Stock Plant
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Electric Report: Workers at the Shijiazhuang Rolling Stock Plant in Hebei Province are giving full play to their efforts, innovating product designs, saving raw materials, and increasing the production of freight vehicles.

    不断进行产品革命　积极开辟材料来源
    增产车辆支援铁路运输沈阳机车车辆厂
    据新华社沈阳电　沈阳机车车辆厂，今年在按月完成计划的同时，还为国家增产了四十三台机车、五百零二辆货车，机车货车的质量都达到了国家要求的技术标准，有力地支援了铁路运输。
    为了增产车辆，这个厂的党委发动职工用土办法生产了一百一十多种急需的原材料，同时还发动群众从厂内搜集了六千多吨废钢，保证了铸钢件的生产。他们还大搞原材料的节约代用，裁剪拼凑，合理使用。6月份，国家供应他们制造一百八十辆货车的原材料，由于他们增产和节约了原材料，结果生产了五百多辆，创造了全厂月产量的最高纪录。
    大连机车厂
    据新华社旅大电　大连机车厂不断进行产品革命，到7月25日为止，全厂今年机车产量比去年同期增长86.3％，货车增长17.2％。
    为了生产更多的机车，这个厂发动群众大搞产品革命，他们在“建设型”机车的设计上进行了第七次改革。经过改革，原来做九台机车的原材料，在保证质量的情况下，现在能生产出十台机车，而且节省加工工时25％。
