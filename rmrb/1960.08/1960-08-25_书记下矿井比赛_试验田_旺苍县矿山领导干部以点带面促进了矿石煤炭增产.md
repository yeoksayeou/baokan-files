Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 24th: Since July, Wangcang County, Sichuan Province, has launched a secretary's "experimental plot" mine competition, using the "experimental plot" as the center to drive overall production, which has greatly changed the face of mine production. The county's ore production level in July increased by 7.9% compared with June, and from August 1st to 18th, the daily output level increased by 5.49% compared with July. The output of raw coal and coke has also increased significantly, strongly supporting blast furnace production.

The competition of secretaries going to the mines to cultivate "experimental plots" in Wangcang County has developed on the basis of implementing the "four togethers" with cadres and workers: eating together, living together, working together, and discussing together. Since the beginning of this year, the county's iron smelting production level has greatly improved, and the demand for ore and fuel has become increasingly large. In order to create experience to promote overall progress and accelerate the development of the mining industry, the Wangcang County Party Committee, after leading cadres at all levels went deep into the front line of production, immediately organized the Party Committee secretaries of the county's iron and steel enterprises to cultivate large-scale mine "experimental plots" and launched a competition between the "experimental plots."

At present, leading cadres of the county's main mines have cultivated nineteen pairs of mine "experimental plots." They formulate monthly competition indicators for output, quality, tunneling, mining, and work efficiency, and adhere to evaluations every ten days. Before the evaluation, the County Party Secretary leads the responsible cadres of each factory and mine to conduct acceptance inspections, and the outstanding units are selected at the end of the month. This competition and evaluation acceptance system has promoted leading cadres to further delve into production, improve their leadership style and methods, and effectively promote the overall leap forward in mine production and construction. In the past, the Baihui Coal and Iron Plant's ore production could not keep up with the needs of the blast furnace. After launching the "experimental plot" competition, the Coal and Iron Plant Party Committee Secretary insisted on working shifts underground and found that the main reason for the low ore production was that the mine was small, the roadways were narrow, the ceiling was poorly maintained, and the underground transportation track was not managed. Therefore, he immediately convened a "three-in-one" meeting to study specific measures, quickly carry out roadway technical transformation, strengthen ceiling management, and assign special personnel to repair the transportation track. In this way, the mine's production situation was changed in just seven days, increasing the daily ore output by 100%, and the pig iron output in July also increased by about 100% as a result. Chen Zijing, the Party Committee Secretary of the Puji Coal and Iron Plant, organized workers to actively promote advanced tools such as drilling and rock drilling in the mine "experimental plot" competition. Some workers were not accustomed to using new tools, so he launched a "production sports meeting" for workers, displaying and comparing new and old tools, and using concrete facts to educate the workers. If there was insufficient labor force underground, he discussed with the workers to improve the labor organization of ground workers, transfer personnel to enrich the underground, and helped workers strengthen quota management. With his specific help, the mine quickly achieved a double harvest of mining and tunneling, and the daily tunneling footage and daily ore output both doubled.

All large and small mines in the county take the secretary's mine as a model, striving to learn and catch up, making the mine production situation better and better. Since July, all mines in the county have quickly promoted "four-eight staggered operations" and advanced tools such as sliding double hammers and impact hammers based on the experience summarized by the secretary's experimental plot mines, improved the ground labor organization, so that underground production personnel generally accounted for more than 80% of production workers. Due to the strengthening of tunneling work, the number of mining faces in each mine has increased, creating conditions for increasing ore production. After breaking through the key to tunneling, each mine carried out large-scale transportation double-tracking, linkage, ball bearing, and loading and unloading automation to increase the amount of ore transported down the mountain. Now, many mines in the county have realized transportation double-tracking, and half of the main mines have realized transportation linkage, so that ore can be transported directly from the mine to the blast furnace. Due to the continuous increase in ore and fuel production, it has been ensured that the vast majority of blast furnaces in the county can be well-fed, and 20% of the blast furnaces have "surplus grain."

The secretary's experimental plot mine competition movement carried out in Wangcang County has driven the blast furnace, raw coal, and coking systems to improve production. The factory and mine around the secretary experimental plot mine competition, mobilize the masses at all levels, carry out the opponent competition between factory and factory, between the mine and the mine, between the team and the team, and between individuals, so that all cadres and workers on the iron and steel front are involved in the competition movement. After the metallurgical system launched a competition centered on the secretary's experimental furnace, the furnace type has been generally improved, the air supply system has been improved, the air volume has been increased, and the air temperature has been increased in the past month or so. Coal production has accelerated tunneling and transportation, and promoted advanced experience such as rapid coking, so the production face of coal, iron, mine, and transportation has been effectively changed. Recently, the county has launched a new competition with the goal of achieving fifty high-yield mines, fifty high-yield coke ovens, renovating five thousand tools, and training ten thousand pacesetters, to further promote high-quality and high-yield pig iron.

    书记下矿井比赛“试验田”
    旺苍县矿山领导干部以点带面促进了矿石煤炭增产
    新华社成都24日电　四川省旺苍县从7月份以来开展书记试验田矿井比武竞赛，以“试验田”为中心带动全面生产，大大改变了矿山生产面貌。全县7月份的矿石生产水平比6月份增长了7.9％，8月1日至18日又比7月份日产水平增长5.49％；原煤、焦炭产量也有很大增长，有力地支援了高炉生产。
    旺苍县书记上矿山种“试验田”的比武竞赛，是在实行干部与工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量的基础上发展起来的。今年以来，这个县因为炼铁生产水平大大提高，矿石、燃料的需要量越来越大。为了创造经验推动全面，加速发展采掘工业，中共旺苍县委在各级领导干部深入生产第一线后，立即组织全县炼铁企业党委书记大种矿山“试验田”，并且在“试验田”之间开展了竞赛。
    目前，全县主要矿山的领导干部已经种了十九对矿井“试验田”，他们按月制订产量、质量、掘进、回采、工效等竞赛指标，坚持十天一评比。评比前由县委书记率领各厂矿党委负责干部进行验收，月底评选优胜单位。这种竞赛和评比验收制度，促使领导干部进一步深入生产，改进领导作风和领导方法，有效地推动了矿山生产建设全面跃进。白水煤铁厂过去矿石生产赶不上高炉需要，开展“试验田”比武竞赛后，煤铁厂党委书记坚持到井下跟班劳动，发现矿石产量低的主要原因是矿井小、巷道窄、顶棚滥、井下运输轨道没有人管理，于是立即召开“三结合”会议，研究具体措施，抓紧进行巷道技术改造，加强顶棚管理，并确定专人维修运输轨道。这样，仅仅经过七天时间就改变了矿山生产状况，使矿石日产量增加了一倍，7月份生铁产量也因此增加了一倍左右。普济煤铁厂党委书记陈子静在矿井“试验田”竞赛中，组织工人积极推广打眼、凿岩等先进工具。有的工人不习惯使用新工具，他就发动工人举行“生产运动会”，把新旧工具拿出来展览对比，用具体事实向工人进行教育。井下劳动力不够，他又和工人商量，改进地面工人的劳动组织，抽调人员充实井下，并帮助工人加强定额管理，经过他的具体帮助，这个矿井很快获得了回采、掘进双丰收，每天的掘进进尺和矿石日产量都提高了一倍。
    全县大小矿山都以书记矿井为标兵，努力学习、追赶，使矿山生产情况越来越好。7月份以来，全县各矿山根据书记试验田矿井总结出来的经验，迅速推广了“四八交叉作业”和滑行二锤、撞锤等先进工具，改进了地面劳动组织，使井下生产人员普遍达到
  占生产工人的80％以上。由于加强了掘进工作，各矿的回采工作面增加了，为提高矿石产量创造了条件。在突破掘进关键以后，各矿山又大搞运输双轨化、联动化、滚珠轴承化、装卸自动化，增运矿石下山。现在全县许多矿山已经实现了运输双轨化，主要矿山已有一半实现了运输联动化，矿石可以从井下一直运到高炉。由于矿石、燃料产量不断提高，保证了全县绝大部分高炉能够吃饱吃好，20％的高炉有了“余粮”。
    旺苍县开展的书记试验田矿井竞赛运动，带动了高炉、原煤、炼焦等各个系统提高生产。各厂矿围绕书记试验田矿井竞赛，层层发动群众，开展厂与厂、井与井、班与班以及个人之间的对手赛，使钢铁战线上所有干部和工人都卷入了竞赛运动。冶炼系统开展以书记试验炉为中心的竞赛后，近一个多月来普遍地改进了炉型，改善了送风系统，加大了风量，提高了风温；煤炭生产加快了掘进和运输，并且推广了快速炼焦等先进经验，因此有效地改变了煤、铁、矿、运各个环节的生产面貌。最近，全县又以实现五十个高产矿井、五十个高产焦窑、革新五千件工具、培养一万名标兵为目标，开展了新的竞赛，进一步促进生铁优质高产。
