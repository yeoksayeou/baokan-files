    A Touching Educational Epic
    Jin Min

    The moving story of Gao Likong, a model teacher who diligently and frugally runs a school, is a touching educational epic that is very thought-provoking.

    The Xinliangdi Village, where Gao Likong runs the school, is on the edge of the desert, a place that is both poor and desolate. To run a school there were no school buildings, desks, textbooks, or teaching aids. He himself was a young man with a low level of education. The difficulties were indeed many. However, for the needs of the Party and the people, Gao Likong was determined to start the school and to run it well. This is the spirit and ideal that a revolutionary should have. With this kind of revolutionary ambition, no matter how difficult the conditions, one will move forward with confidence and in the right direction.

    Having revolutionary ambition requires also revolutionary drive, a spirit of hard work and practical effort. The subjective initiative of people has great significance in overcoming difficulties, but it must be done in a down-to-earth way. Gao Likong is such a person who has both revolutionary ambition and revolutionary drive, with a spirit of hard work and practical effort. Therefore, he was able to closely rely on the masses, start from scratch, and create a new undertaking. When material conditions were poor, he sought help from the masses and devised many "poor man's methods" by using a dilapidated temple as a classroom, building desks out of bricks and earth, and using soot brushed on the wall as a blackboard. With his own low level of education, he studied diligently. Through Gao Likong's hard work, the school was established, and his own knowledge also increased. But he was not satisfied with this. In his spare time, he led students to participate in production through work-study programs. In this way, students' food and expenses were solved. The students also reaped great ideological gains, and the school developed greatly.

    In our era of emerging heroes, it is not uncommon to have revolutionary ambition to overcome difficulties and strive for progress, as well as to be able to work hard and practically. On all fronts of socialist construction, there are tens of thousands of people like Gao Likong. Why can they have such lofty ambitions and unwavering perseverance? The fundamental problem lies in the fact that they have put proletarian politics in command in their thinking. They have established a firm proletarian world outlook, are wholeheartedly loyal to the cause of the Party, and are determined to serve the people and strive for the cause of communism to the end. It is precisely because Gao Likong possesses these noble qualities that he is able to overcome all difficulties and treat the revolutionary cause with perseverance.

    一篇感人的教育诗篇
    金民
    模范教师高立孔勤俭办学的动人事迹，是一篇感人的教育诗篇，读了之后，很发人深思。
    高立孔办学校的新粮地村，在大沙漠的边缘，是个又穷又白的地方，要办学校，没有校舍、课桌，也没有课本和教具，他本人也是个文化程度不高的青年，困难的确很多。但是，高立孔为了党的需要，为了人民的需要，一定要把学校办起来，一定要办好。这是一个革命者应当有的气魄和理想。有了这种革命的志气，不管条件如何困难，也会信心百倍地、向着正确的方向前进。
    有了革命志气，同时要有革命干劲，要有苦干实干的精神。人的主观能动作用，对于克服困难有巨大的意义，问题在于必须扎扎实实去干。高立孔就是这样一个既有革命志气，又有革命干劲，有苦干实干精神的人，因而能紧紧依靠群众，白手起家，创立起新的事业。物质条件不好，他就在群众帮助下，因陋就简，想出了许多“穷办法”，以破庙当教室，用砖头、土块垒成课桌，用锅烟刷在墙上当黑板；自己文化水平低，就刻苦地学习。经过高立孔的艰苦奋斗，学校办起来了，他自己的知识也增加了。但是他并不就此满足，他又在课余时间领导学生参加生产，勤工俭学，这样，学生的伙食、用费都解决了。学生们思想上也有很大的丰收，学校也有了很大发展。
    在我们这个英雄辈出的时代，具有不怕困难、发奋图强的革命志气，又能苦干、实干的人，并不是个别的。在社会主义建设的各个战线上，像高立孔这样的人有成千上万。他们为什么能具有这样的雄心壮志和坚韧不拔的毅力呢？根本问题在于，他们在思想上无产阶级的政治挂了帅。他们树立了坚定的无产阶级世界观，对党的事业忠心耿耿，有为人民服务、为共产主义事业奋斗到底的决心。高立孔正是由于具备了这些高贵品质，所以他能够排除万难、百折不挠地对待革命事业。
