Xinhua News Agency, Hefei. Anhui Province is vigorously producing "Three Autumns" tools in response to the new characteristics of this year's autumn harvest, autumn cultivation, and autumn planting.

The characteristics of Anhui Province's "Three Autumns" production this year are: many farm tasks, heavy workload, and short timeframe. In order to ensure the completion of the "Three Autumns" tasks with quality and quantity, various localities are focusing on the following measures to vigorously promote the production of "Three Autumns" tools. First, implement tool standardization. The province has collected more than 400 pieces of various excellent tools. After operation, more than 100 pieces have been selected for promotion. These tools generally have the advantages of easy material acquisition, low cost, high work efficiency, good operation quality, and wide application range. For example, the ox-drawn rice threshing machine in She County can thresh an average of 2,000 jin per person per day, which is three times higher than before. This threshing machine can be converted from an old-style ox-drawn waterwheel and is mostly made of wood, which can be manufactured by commune industries. The rice harvester in Langxi County can be used in both flooded and non-flooded rice fields. One person can harvest four to five mu per day without grass jamming or clogging. Second, based on the principle of division of labor at the provincial, special district, and county levels, unify arrangements, rationally divide labor, and determine manufacturing and repair tasks. In order to strengthen the manufacturing of threshing and processing tools, Bengbu Special District transformed a general machinery factory into an agricultural machinery factory specializing in the production of agricultural machinery. Each special district, city, and county has selected a factory with a relatively good foundation to serve as a parts factory and repair factory to strengthen the repair work of agricultural tools, striving to ensure that major repairs of agricultural machinery do not leave the special district, medium repairs do not leave the county, and minor repairs do not leave the commune. Third, concentrate efforts on grasping the supporting of irrigation and drainage machinery to ensure that rice is not affected by drought or flood.

This newspaper, Wuhan, 23rd. Xiangyang Special District, Hubei Province, has organized early cooperation between industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation, rushing ahead of the season to rush-produce, repair, and innovate agricultural tools and implements for the autumn harvest and autumn planting. In more than a month, the district has repaired and newly manufactured more than 420,000 pieces of various agricultural tools and implements, of which deep ploughs, plus the original number, have reached more than 200,500 pieces, accounting for 79% of the required number, and deep excavation tools, plus the original number, have reached more than 1.61 million pieces, accounting for more than 82% of the required number.

Starting early and preparing early, rather having tools wait for the season than the season wait for tools, is the biggest feature of industrial support for agriculture in Xiangyang Special District over the past few years. This year, under the guidance of the principle of "taking agriculture as the foundation," the autumn harvest and planting area in this region is larger and the quality requirements are higher than in any previous year. In order to timely supply agriculture with a large number of excellent autumn harvest and planting tools, the Party committees at all levels in this special district attach particular importance to this year's agricultural tool manufacturing, repair, and reform work. Jiao Dexiu, the first secretary of the District Committee, personally went with the workers of the special district's general machinery factory and Jin Fengshan, a national model worker, to the Pangong People's Commune in Xiangfan City to study and improve the Pangong-style three-row automatic seeder with the commune members. After repeated research and multiple modifications, this seeder has become lighter and more flexible, with uniform seed dropping, consistent depth, and suitable row spacing. The cotton-wheat double-cropping characteristic of the Xiangyang area can also be used for intercropping wheat in vegetable fields, and is suitable for mountains, hills, plains. Moreover, it is simple to manufacture and low in cost. In early July, the District Committee held a meeting of county Party secretaries, conducted specific research on autumn deep tillage and sowing tools, and tested and appraised the Pangong-style three-row automatic seeder, deciding to vigorously promote it throughout the district. The meeting also decided to promote the Nanzhang improved plow, which has the advantages of light pulling force, deep tillage, high work efficiency, and low cost.

Before and after the District Committee held the meeting of county Party secretaries, each county successively held meetings of responsible persons from county, commune, industrial, commercial and other relevant departments, and organized a large number of work teams to go deep into the communes and production teams to understand the needs, and then formulated plans for manufacturing agricultural tools and implements in accordance with local conditions.

The counties throughout the district adopted the method of large-scale cooperation between industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation, and quickly launched a high tide of agricultural tool production and repair centered on the manufacture of the Pangong-style three-row automatic seeder and the Nanzhang improved plow. The county and commune machinery factories and agricultural tool factories in Sui County drew more than 4,000 workers, specializing in the seeder and deep plough as the main targets for large-scale transformation and manufacturing; at the same time, more than 21,000 workers formed more than 560 repair teams to go deep into the production teams to carry out repairs. The county commercial departments organized more than 100 purchasing teams to collect scrap iron and old materials; the transportation departments organized hundreds of horse-drawn carts and flatbed carts to transport fuel and raw materials to the factories. From mid-June to early July, the county has produced more than 1,900 deep ploughs, more than 200 seeders, newly manufactured more than 180,000 pieces of tools such as harrows, ploughshares, and digging hoes, and repaired more than 86,000 pieces of various tools.

In order to ensure the quality of newly manufactured agricultural tools, especially the newly promoted Pangong-style seeder and Nanzhang improved plow, the counties and communes have transferred a group of workers from agricultural tool factories to concentrate on learning production technology. At the same time, the District Committee and County Committee also organized working groups to conduct inspections. Many agricultural tool factories have established strict inspection systems, and some factories have established contacts with nearby production teams, sending each product to the fields for appraisal before leaving the factory, ensuring product quality.

    抢在农事季节前面准备工具
    安徽省专县三级分工突击赶制“三秋”工具
    湖北襄阳专区各方协作大造条播器深耕犁
    据新华社合肥讯　安徽省各地针对今年秋收、秋耕、秋种的新特点，正在大力赶制“三秋”工具。
    安徽省今年“三秋”生产的特点是：农活多、任务大、时间短。各地为了保证按质按量地完成“三秋”任务，着重采取如下几项措施，大抓“三秋”工具生产。第一，实行工具定型。全省集中各种优良工具四百多件，经过操作，已评选出一百多件加以推广。这些工具一般都具有取材容易、造价低廉、工效高、作业质量好、适用范围广等优点。如歙县的牛拉打稻机，平均一人一天可脱粒二千斤，比原来提高工效三倍。这种打稻机可用旧式牛拉水车改装，绝大部分是木制的，公社工业都能制造。郎溪县的水稻收割器，在有水无水的稻田里都可以使用，一人操作每天可收割四至五亩，不卡草，不堵塞。第二，根据省、专区、县三级分工的原则，统一安排，合理分工，确定制造和修配任务。蚌埠专区为了加强脱粒加工工具的制造，把一个通用机械厂改为农业机械厂，专门生产农业机具。各专区、市、县都选择一个基础较好的工厂做配件厂和修配厂，加强农具的修配工作，力争做到农业机器大修不出专区，中修不出县，小修不出社。第三，集中力量抓排灌机械配套，保证水稻不受旱涝。
    本报武汉23日电　湖北省襄阳专区及早组织工、农、商、交通大协作，抢在季节前面，为秋收、秋种赶制、修配、革新农具和工具。一个多月来，全区已修配和新制各种农具和工具四十二万多件，其中深耕犁加上原有数已达二十万零五千多件，占需要数的79％，深挖工具加上原有数已达一百六十一万件，占需要数的82％以上。
    早动手、早准备，宁叫工具等季节，不叫季节等工具，是襄阳专区几年来工业支援农业的最大特点。今年在“以农业为基础”的方针指导下，这个地区秋收秋种面积比过去任何一年都大，质量要求比任何一年都高。为了及时供应农业大批优良的秋收秋种工具，这个专区的各级党委特别重视今年的农具制造、修配和改革工作。地委第一书记焦德秀亲自同专区通用机械厂工人、全国劳动模范金凤山到襄樊市庞公人民公社和社员们一起研究改进庞公式三行自动条播器。经过反复研究、多次修改后，使这种条播器更加轻便灵巧，下籽均匀、深浅一致，行距适合。襄阳地区棉麦两熟特点，也可用在菜地里套种小麦，山区、岗地、平原都适用。而且制造简便、成本低。7月初，地委召开县委书记会议，对秋季深耕、播种工具作了具体研究，对庞公式三行自动条播器又进行了试验鉴定，决定在全区大力推广。会上还决定推广具有拉力轻、耕得深、工效高、成本低等优点的南漳改良犁。
    在地委召开县委书记会议的前后，各县都先后召开了县、社工业、商业等有关部门负责人会议，并组织大批工作组深入到公社、生产队了解需要情况，然后因地制宜地订出制造农具和工具的规划。
    全区各县采取工、农、商、交通大协作的办法，很快掀起了以制造庞公式三行自动条播器和南漳改良犁为中心的农具生产、修配高潮。随县的县、社机械厂、农具厂抽出四千多工人，专门以条播器、深耕犁为主攻对象，进行大改大造；同时以二万一千多名工人组成五百六十多个修配组，深入到生产队进行修配。县商业部门组织了一百多个收购组，收购废铁旧料；交通部门组织了数百辆马车、板车，向工厂运送燃料和原料。从6月中旬到7月上旬，全县已生产深耕犁一千九百多部，条播器二百多部，新制耙、犁铧、挖锄等工具十八万多件，修理各种工具八万六千多件。
    为了保证新制农具特别是新推广的庞公式条播器和南漳改良犁的质量，各县、公社都抽调了一批农具厂的工人集中学习生产技术。同时，地委、县委还组织工作组进行了检查。许多农具厂建立起严格的检验制度，有些厂并和附近生产队建立联系，把每部产品都送到田间进行鉴定，然后出厂，保证了产品质量。（附图片）
