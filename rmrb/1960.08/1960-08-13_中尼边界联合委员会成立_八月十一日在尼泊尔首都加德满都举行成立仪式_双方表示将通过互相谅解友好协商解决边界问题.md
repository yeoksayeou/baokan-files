Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, August 12th: The China-Nepal Joint Boundary Commission held its inauguration ceremony on August 11th in Kathmandu, the capital of the Kingdom of Nepal.

This joint commission was established in accordance with the provisions of the Boundary Agreement signed between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Kingdom of Nepal.

The inauguration ceremony was presided over by the Deputy Prime Minister of Nepal, Subarna Shamsher, at Singha Durbar.

The Chinese side was represented by Chief Representative Zhang Shijie, Representatives Senior Colonel Lu Yishan, Lieutenant Colonel Deng Ting, and Zhang Baohua. The Nepalese side was represented by Chief Representative Major General Padma Bahadur Khatri, Representatives Mohan Bahadur Singh, Narayan Prasad Raj Bhandari, Captain Adita Shumshere, and Captain Bharat Keshari Singh.

In his address at the inauguration ceremony, Subarna Shamsher said that Nepal and China have always respected and maintained the traditional customary boundary line. Therefore, I do not need to repeat that the main task of the committee is to scientifically delineate and formally demarcate the boundary along the traditional customary line. I can say with certainty that, except for a few disputed areas, both sides share the same view on the boundary. I believe that we can also resolve the issue of disputed areas through mutual understanding, cooperation, and friendly discussion.

Deputy Prime Minister Shamsher said, "I hope that this meeting of the China-Nepal Boundary Commission will successfully delineate and formally demarcate the boundary in accordance with the traditional customary boundary line between Nepal and China."

At the end of his speech, the Deputy Prime Minister shouted "Long live Nepal-China friendship."

In his speech, Chief Representative of the Chinese side Zhang Shijie recalled the traditional friendship between China and Nepal and the development of friendly relations. Zhang Shijie particularly emphasized that the mutual visits of the two Prime Ministers and the treaties and agreements recently signed between the two countries indicate that the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Nepal have entered a new stage.

Regarding the boundary issue, Zhang Shijie said, "Both countries have sincerely expressed their willingness to reach a solution based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and in the spirit of fairness, reasonableness, mutual understanding, and mutual accommodation through friendly consultations. In fact, the final settlement of the boundary issue will not only further greatly strengthen the friendly relations between our two countries, but also bring great benefits to the people of our two countries. Both of our countries are eager to have a stable, peaceful, and friendly boundary. The Chinese government has sent us here to negotiate with the Nepalese side out of a sincere desire to seek such a final solution."

Zhang Shijie also assured the Nepalese representatives that "We will make every effort in our work and cooperate amicably with our Nepalese friends in order to quickly and satisfactorily complete the glorious task entrusted to us and realize the common aspirations of our two governments and peoples."

Finally, Zhang Shijie expressed his gratitude to the Government of the Kingdom of Nepal for the warm hospitality extended to the Chinese delegation.

Also present at the ceremony were Nepal's Acting Foreign Affairs Secretary Prakash Man Singh and First Secretary of the Chinese Embassy, Liu Yamin.
