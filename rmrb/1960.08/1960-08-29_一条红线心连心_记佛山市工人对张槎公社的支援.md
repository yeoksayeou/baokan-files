A Red Line Links Hearts
·A Record of Foshan Workers' Support for Zhangcha Commune·
By Our Correspondent Dèng Guóxiáng

When the various cities and towns of Guangdong mobilized thousands of troops to support the rural areas in rice transplanting, I came to Zhangcha Commune in the suburbs of Foshan City. Here, the late rice seedlings had already been transplanted ahead of schedule. The returning green seedlings, a vibrant green expanse, swayed in the wind. When we talked to the people cultivating in the fields about this year's production, the commune members said that if it hadn't been for the help of the worker elder brothers, summer planting wouldn't have been completed twenty days early, and might have even delayed the season! It turned out that this spring, there had been a long period of drought here. At the critical moment of fighting the drought, 66 factories in Foshan City sent thousands of employees to equip Zhangcha Commune with a large number of irrigation and drainage machines and other agricultural machinery and equipment. Now, everywhere in Zhangcha Commune, one can see the power of industrial equipment displayed in agricultural production.

Irrigation and Drainage Controlled by People; Resistance to Both Drought and Flood

Zhangcha Commune is a semi-embanked field, semi-hilly area. There are no ponds here, and the highlands cannot get water for irrigation. As for the embanked fields, the tide cannot flow in; and when the river water outside the embankment rises, the accumulated water inside cannot be drained out. Therefore, if it doesn't rain for five days, we have to fight the drought; if there is 60 millimeters of heavy rain in one day, we have to drain the flood. Every year, the labor force spent on fighting drought and flood accounts for about 30% of agricultural production labor, and we still suffer from drought and flood disasters frequently. Last year, when the early rice was about to mature, it rained heavily for three days. Many of the crops that had been growing well were damaged by the rain. This year is different. Although it is dry and doesn't rain, the four electric irrigation and drainage stations in the commune, with the flick of a switch, send out thick columns of water, forcing water into the fields, so that 80% of the commune's paddy fields can be drained and irrigated.

The members of the Baini Brigade have the deepest feeling about this year's change. Commune member Lü Tong pointed to a large area of high fields opposite the Yudai Sand Irrigation and Drainage Station and said that in previous years, they often set up a large "waterwheel formation" there. The higher fields continuously connected eleven waterwheels, and even the lowest fields needed five waterwheels to pump the water up level by level. Each waterwheel was managed by six people, and the waterwheels creaked day and night, but the water pumped was often not enough to meet the needs of the paddy fields. But this year, when the irrigation and drainage station was turned on, the water in the canal was sent to the high fields, and in less than six hours, this area, which accounted for half of the team's area, was filled with water. Speaking of this, Lü Tong became even happier, and he said, "This year, the weather is dry but the land is not dry. We can defeat the heavens!"

During the interview in Zhangcha Commune, we encountered three consecutive days of heavy rain. Many seedlings in the Bitang Brigade, which is low-lying and does not benefit from electric irrigation and drainage, were flooded. The commune members were very anxious. At this moment, the commune sent a drainage boat to drain the flood and rescue the seedlings. This kind of drainage boat was also specially made by the workers of Foshan City for this kind of embanked field and water network area in Zhangcha Commune. Wherever the power of the electric irrigation and drainage station cannot be exerted, the drainage boat goes there, specializing in eliminating "dead corners" and becoming a powerful helper of the irrigation and drainage station. When the drainage boat arrived in Bitang, it drained 50 mu per day, and in just 48 hours, the flooded seedlings were exposed above the water.

Smooth Transportation by Vehicles and Boats Replaces Carrying on Shoulders

In Zhangcha Commune, rivers and canals form a network, and roads extend in all directions. The cadres introduced to us: These roads and waterways were opened up this spring by all the commune members to welcome the large number of vehicles, boats, and pumps manufactured by the Foshan workers.

Zhangcha Commune is a non-staple food production base serving the city. The commune manages a large number of vegetables. The commodity rate of the products is high, and the transportation volume is also large. Every day, more than 100,000 catties of vegetables are transported to the city, and a large amount of manure is transported back from the city. From Zhangcha to Foshan, it is only a little over ten li. In the past, the harvested vegetables often had to be transported to the market the next day. When it was busy with farming, the labor force could not be spared, and the vegetables would rot if they could not be transported out. Now, vehicles and boats have replaced carrying on shoulders. Cars can drive directly to the vegetable fields. Now, the people of Foshan can eat fresh vegetables picked on the same day every day.

This year, the number of vegetables produced in Zhangcha Commune is large, and the variety is diverse. In the past, the commune's plan to expand the vegetable planting area was always difficult to complete because of the shortage of labor. The effort spent on planting one mu of vegetables is equal to planting three mu of paddy fields. This year, with vehicle and boat transportation, electric irrigation and drainage, and the continuous reform of other tools, a large number of labor forces have been saved. They invested the saved labor force in the development of vegetable production, which expanded the vegetable area by 20% compared with last year, and increased the total output by 40%.

Line of Happiness

The vigorous support of industry for agriculture, and the vigorous support of agriculture for the city after the increase in production. This kind of moving deed of mutual support and hand-in-hand progress has caused profound changes in the thinking of the peasants; the relationship between workers and peasants has become closer, and the worker-peasant alliance has become more consolidated. The support of industry has not only increased agricultural production, but also liberated the peasants from heavy physical labor. Commune member Lü Li said: "Since the workers helped build the irrigation and drainage station, we don't have to work so hard to pump water into the fields anymore. Just on this point alone, our peasants have benefited a lot." In Baini Village, the commune members have also benefited from another thing, that is, all 204 households in the village have installed electric lights. In the evening, many commune members go to the people's school to study culture under the bright electric lights. Some also gather in front of the radio in groups of three or two to listen to operas and news, eliminating the fatigue of the day... The commune members have not forgotten all this, the selfless labor and enthusiastic support of the Foshan workers this spring. At that time, the workers erected high-voltage power lines, ate on the mountain tops, and slept by the river. When encountering cold waves, they also faced the cold north wind and persisted in high-altitude operations. The workers said: "Thinking of the happy life of rural electrification, my heart is warm, and I don't feel any cold." These heartfelt words reached the ears of the peasants, and the peasants called the high-voltage power line the "line of happiness" to express their gratitude to the workers.

"Line of Happiness"—This is a high-voltage power line that connects Foshan and Zhangcha, connecting the city and the countryside.

"Line of Happiness"—This is also a red line that connects the hearts of workers and peasants.

    一条红线心连心
    ·记佛山市工人对张槎公社的支援·
    本报记者　邓国庠
    当广东各个城镇动员千军万马支援农村插秧的时候，记者来到了佛山市郊的张槎公社。这里的晚稻秧苗已经提前插完。返青的禾苗，绿油油的一片，随风摆荡。我们和田间中耕的人谈起今年的生产，社员们说，今年要不是工人老大哥的帮忙，夏种别说能提早二十天插完，说不定还要耽误季节呢！原来，在今年春天，这里曾经久旱不雨。正当抗旱的紧要关头，佛山市的六十六个工厂派来了上千名职工，为张槎公社装备了大批排灌机械和其他农业机械设备。现在，在张槎公社到处可以看到工业的装备在农业生产上所显示的威力。
    排灌由人　水旱能抗
    张槎公社是个半围田、半丘陵区。这里没有水塘，高地得不到水源灌溉。围田呢，潮水流不进来；而围外江水一涨，围内积水又排不出去。所以，五天不下雨，就要抗旱；一天降六十毫米大雨，又要排涝。每年花在抗旱排涝上的劳动力，占农业生产用工的30％左右，而且还要经常遭受旱涝之灾。去年早稻将要成熟时，下了三天大雨，眼看长得很好的庄稼，却给雨水浸坏了许多。今年不同了。虽然天旱不雨，但社内四个电动排灌站，一扳动开关，就冒出一股股粗大的水柱来，迫水上田，使得全社80％的稻田都能排能灌。
    今年的这个变化，白坭大队的社员感受最深。社员吕桐指着玉带沙排灌站对面的一大片高田说，往年他们经常在那里大摆“水车阵”。高的田连续接驳十一递水车，最低的田也要五递水车，才能把渠水一级一级的车上去。一递水车六个人管，水车没日没夜地咿咿呀呀的响着，车的水往往还不能满足稻田的需要。而今年呢，排灌站开动了电钮，渠水滚滚地被送上高田，不到六个钟头，这一片占全队面积一半的高田就灌满了水。说到这里，吕桐越发高兴起来，他说：“今年是天旱地不旱，天公斗不过我们啦！”
    在张槎公社采访期间，遇到连续三天的暴雨。地势低洼、又沾不到电动排灌利益的弼塘大队不少禾苗被淹了。社员都非常着急。正在这时，公社派了排灌船来排涝抢救。这种排灌船，也是佛山市工人特地为张槎公社这类围田水网地带制作的。凡是电动排灌站威力施展不到的地方，排灌船就开到那里，专门消灭“死角”，成为排灌站的得力助手。排灌船到了弼塘，以一天排水五十亩的速度，仅仅用了四十八个小时，就使受淹的禾苗露出水面。
    车船畅通　代替肩挑
    在张槎公社，河渠成网，公路四通八达。干部向我们介绍说：这些公路、河道，是今年春天，全社社员为迎接佛山工人制造的大量车、船和抽水机而开辟出来的。
    张槎公社是为城镇服务的副食品生产基地。社内经营着大量蔬菜。产品的商品率大，运输量也大。每天都有十多万斤蔬菜运往城市，又从城市运回大批粪便。从张槎到佛山，不过十多里路程。以往收割下来的蔬菜，往往要隔天才能运到市场去。遇上农忙，劳动力排不开，菜运不出就要腐烂。如今，车船代替了肩挑。汽车可以直开到菜地。现在，佛山人民天天都能吃到当天摘下来的新鲜蔬菜。
    今年张槎公社生产的蔬菜数量大，品种多。过去公社提出扩大蔬菜种植面积的计划，总是不容易完成，原因是劳动力不足。种一亩蔬菜所花的工夫，等于种三亩稻田。今年有了车船运输，电动排灌，再加上其他工具的不断改革，就节省出来大批劳动力。他们把节省出来的劳动力投到发展蔬菜生产上，使蔬菜面积比去年扩大了20％，总产量增加40％。
    幸福线
    工业大力支援农业，农业增产后又有力地支援了城市。这种相互支援、携手并进的动人事迹，在农民的思想上引起了深刻的变化；工农关系更加密切了，工农联盟更加巩固了。工业的支援既使农业增了产，又使农民从繁重的体力劳动中解放了出来。社员吕黎说：“自从工人帮助建了排灌站，就再不用那么辛苦地往田里车水了。单表这一点，我们农民就受福不浅。”在白泥村，社员受福的还有一桩，就是全村有二百零四户安装了电灯。一到晚上，许多社员都上民校去，在亮堂堂的电灯下学文化。有的还三家两户地聚在收音机前面，听戏曲，听新闻，消除一天的疲劳……。这一切，社员都没有忘记，今年春天佛山市工人的那种忘我的劳动，热情的支援。那时，工人架设高压电线，吃在山头，睡在河边。遇上寒潮，还迎着凛冽的北风，坚持高空作业。工人说：“想到农村电气化的幸福生活，心里就热呼呼的，什么寒气都不觉得了。”这些深情厚意的话语，传到了农民的耳朵里，农民们都把高压电线叫做“幸福线”，以表达他们对工人的谢意。
    “幸福线”——这是一条高压电线，把佛山和张槎连结起来，把城市和乡村连结在一起。
    “幸福线”——这又是一条红线，把工人和农民的心结连在一起。
