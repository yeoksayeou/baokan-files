Taking Solid Measures, Persisting in Disaster Resistance to the End
Zhaotong Deeply Mobilizes the Masses to Fight the Autumn Drought

(Reported by this newspaper) Cadres and the masses in Zhaotong County, Yunnan Province, with the heroic spirit of "If the sky doesn't rain, people will rain; resist the drought until the crops turn yellow," have launched a struggle against the heavens for grain, resisting the autumn drought. The entire county has mobilized more than 50,000 people, taking solid measures of "three priorities and three follow-ups" and "four implementations, four correspondences" to resist drought and protect the autumn harvest. Currently, more than 90% of the disaster-stricken area has been irrigated once, with the severely drought-affected 60,000+ mu being irrigated two to three times.

In the past twenty days, Zhaotong County has experienced prolonged sunny weather with no rain, and the drought is severely threatening crop growth, gradually expanding from the riverside valley areas to the plains and semi-mountainous regions. At present, all twenty-one communes in the county, except for Dashanbao and Shuimo, are generally affected by drought. Judging from the current growth of various crops, corn is in the pollination period, rice is in the heading and flowering stage, and beans are flowering and podding, all requiring sufficient moisture. Therefore, the County Party Committee issued an emergency call, mobilizing cadres and the masses throughout the county to resolutely fight against the drought, demanding that leaders at all levels display the same spirit as they did during drought-resistant planting to lead the current movement to resist drought and protect the autumn harvest. The County Party Committee organized 1,512 people from government offices, schools, factories, mines, enterprises, and urban residents, led by the County Party Secretary, and equipped them with pumps, water pumps, buckets, and other drought-fighting tools to support drought resistance in the five severely drought-affected communes of Mengquan, Bolu, Tucheng, Yongfeng, and Wenping.

Party committees at all levels have deeply mobilized the masses, summarizing past experiences in drought resistance and winning bumper harvests, and boosting the morale of the masses in resisting drought. The masses in the Jiangdi Management Area of the Dashuijing Commune all said: We have many years of experience in competing with the heavens, and as long as we persist in the struggle, we can protect the harvest. The entire management area organized a drought-fighting army of more than 1,100 people, and irrigated all the drought-affected corn once in two days. After the Tucheng Commune conducted a mass calculation of losses due to drought and gains from drought resistance, on the 18th alone, they watered and carried water to irrigate 2,700 mu of fields, and watered 877 mu of corn.

In the drought-fighting struggle, various localities, through assessment and calculation, and based on the principle of prioritizing basic farmland over general farmland, prioritizing severely affected areas with high potential for increased production over generally drought-affected land, and prioritizing rice and corn over miscellaneous grains, have adopted the method of "four implementations, four correspondences" to carry out a concentrated drought-fighting effort. First, the drought-affected area is implemented, specific measures are found according to the degree of drought, and measures correspond to the disaster situation. Second, labor is implemented; in areas particularly severely affected by drought, all-out efforts are made to resist drought, while in generally drought-affected areas, specialized teams are organized to carry out a concentrated drought-fighting effort; less labor is used in lightly affected areas and fields with convenient water sources, and more labor is used in severely affected areas and fields with poor water source conditions; so that labor corresponds to the land. Third, water sources are implemented, and water corresponds to the land. The entire county has calculated water accounts and ranked water sources in accordance with the principle of ensuring the needs of drought resistance while also ensuring water use for the minor spring crops and next year's major spring crops. It is determined that long-flowing water will be used for gravity irrigation, and repairs will be organized in time for ditches and roads that are not smooth; small dams and ponds are easy to close and store water, and can be used to irrigate dry land; at the same time, full use is made of groundwater, and measures such as digging ponds, drilling wells, carrying water, and lifting water are taken to resist drought. The county-wide assessment resulted in seventeen reservoirs, in addition to high mountain reservoirs, that can be used for drought resistance, which are uniformly controlled by the County Party Committee and water discharge targets are issued according to the irrigation area and drought-affected area of each reservoir. Each commune also determines drought resistance measures based on this principle. Fourth, drought-fighting tools are implemented, and tools are allocated to the teams according to the needs of the drought-affected area, so that tools correspond to labor, in order to maximize labor efficiency, and any shortages are resolved by rushing to make repairs.

Because cadres at all levels personally went to the front lines and took solid drought-fighting measures, the county's drought-fighting struggle has achieved great victory. As of the 19th, a total of 1,498 large and small ditches have been repaired throughout the county, and a total of 145,525 mu have been irrigated by pumping, lifting, and diverting water, accounting for 91.5% of the drought-affected area.

    采取扎实措施　坚持抗灾到底
    昭通深入发动群众大战秋旱
    本报讯　云南昭通县干部群众以“天不下雨人下雨，抗旱抗到庄稼黄”的英雄气概，展开了与天争粮抵抗秋旱的斗争。全县出动了五万多人，采取“三先三后”“四落实、四对口”的扎实措施抗旱保秋。现在已有90％以上的受灾面积，普遍灌水一次，其中受旱严重的六万多亩，已灌水二至三次。
    近二十天来，昭通县各地久晴不雨，旱象严重威胁着庄稼成长，由江边河谷地带，逐渐扩展到平坝、半山区。目前，全县二十一个公社除大山包、水磨等公社外，都普遍受旱。从目前各种作物的成长情况看，包谷正是授粉时期，水稻正在吐穗扬花，豆子正在开花结荚，各项作物都需要充足的水分。因此，县委发出了紧急号召，动员全县干部群众坚决与干旱作斗争，要求各级领导拿出抗旱栽插的劲头来领导当前抗旱保秋运动。县委从机关、学校、厂矿、企业、城镇居民中，组织了一千五百一十二人，由县委书记率领，带上抽水机、水泵、水桶等抗旱工具，分赴干旱较严重的蒙泉、博禄、土城、永丰、文屏等五个公社支援抗旱。
    各级党委深入发动群众总结历年抗旱夺丰收的经验，鼓起群众的抗旱劲头。大水井公社江底管理区群众都说：我们已有多年和老天爷较量的经验，只要坚持斗争，就能保住收成。全管理区组织了一千一百多人的抗旱大军，两天就把受旱包谷全部灌水一次。土城公社通过群众性的算受旱减产账和抗旱增产账后，仅18日一天就车水、挑水灌田二千七百亩，浇了包谷八百七十七亩。
    在抗旱斗争中，各地通过排队算账，本着先抗基本农田，后抗一般农田；先抗受灾严重而增产潜力大的，后抗一般受旱田地；先抗水稻、包谷，后抗杂粮的原则，采取“四落实、四对口”的办法突击抗旱。第一、受旱面积落实，按干旱程度找出具体办法，做到措施与灾情对口。第二、劳力落实，干旱特别严重的地方是全力以赴抗旱，一般受旱地区便组织专业队突击抗旱；轻灾和水源方便的田地，使用劳力少，重灾和水源条件差的田地，使用劳力多；使劳力与田地对口。第三、水源落实，实行水与田对口。全县按照既能保证抗旱需要，又能保证小春用水和明年大春用水的原则，算了水账，进行水源排队。确定长流水进行自流灌溉，沟路不通及时组织修补；小坝塘容易关蓄，可以放水灌溉旱地；同时，充分利用地下水，采取挖塘、打井、挑水、提水等办法抗旱。全县排队结果，除高山水库外，能够用以抗旱的有十七个水库，由县委统一掌握并按各水库灌区、受旱面积下达放水指标。各公社亦根据这一原则，确定抗旱措施。第四、抗旱工具落实，按受旱面积需要把工具落实到队，使工具与劳力对口，以发挥劳动效率，不足的及时赶制修补解决。
    由于各级干部亲赴前线，采取扎扎实实的抗旱措施，因而全县的抗旱斗争取得了很大的胜利。到19日止，全县共修通大小沟道一千四百九十八条，车水提水引水灌溉面积共十四万五千五百二十五亩，占受旱面积的91.5％。
