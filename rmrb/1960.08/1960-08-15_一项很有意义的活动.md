    A Very Meaningful Activity
    The "Everyone Refines a Furnace of Qualified Steel Every Day" activity carried out by the leading cadres of the No. 1 Converter Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company is, as the news introduction says, a very meaningful activity.
    How is a furnace of steel made? What are the links from batching to casting? What are the key problems in many links of production? All those who directly participate in production and deal with converters and open-hearth furnaces every day know it very well. However, those who are not familiar enough with production technology may not understand it so deeply. After the "Everyone Refines a Furnace of Steel Every Day" activity was launched, one problem after another was directly placed in front of the leaders. The leading cadres of the No. 1 Converter Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company carried out the "Everyone Refines a Furnace of Steel Every Day" activity for only nine days, and the situation changed greatly: the leading personnel mastered production technology better, had more methods, and felt more confident about the overall production situation. How can such an activity not be said to be a very meaningful activity?
    Leading cadres go deep into the front line with various activities: mastering the key to production and staying at the key point is one kind of activity; taking a certain main product as the goal and grasping the entire line of production of this product is another kind of activity. Various activities and practices will discover some specific problems in production and directly solve some specific problems. However, for comprehensive leaders, grasping the main products, doing it themselves, planting a "test field," summarizing production experience in production practice, and promoting production progress are more significant in meaning and influence. Two years ago, the whole party and the whole people were engaged in large-scale steelmaking. Many farmers from the countryside had no experience in ironmaking at all. At that time, the newspaper put forward the call for party committee secretaries to go to the forefront of steelmaking, and soon there was a magnificent scene of "the secretary sleeps by the furnace, and one furnace lights up ten thousand furnaces." Today, the leadership experience in steel production in various places is richer than in the past; the experience of cadres participating in steelmaking activities in the No. 1 Converter Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company is widely spread, and our steel front will have a more beautiful landscape.
    Of course, the important significance of this activity is not limited to this. More importantly, it gives the leading personnel a technical test. Technology is not mysterious. According to the statistics of the No. 1 Converter Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company from August 1st to 9th, the plant's steel production level increased by 76% compared with the same period last month, and the pass rate increased by 9.4%. This large increase reflects the great achievements of leading cadres in studying technology; however, this cannot be simply regarded as the result of studying technology. Technology serves politics, and when politics is put in command of technology, the steelmaking furnace will emit a newer light of high yield and high quality.
    Our steel production is facing a new situation, which requires our leadership to be more in-depth, more down-to-earth, and more specific. The cadre steelmaking activity carried out by the No. 1 Converter Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company is an experience with far-reaching significance.

### 一项很有意义的活动

    一项很有意义的活动
    重庆钢铁公司转炉一厂的领导干部开展“每人每天炼一炉合格钢”的活动，确如新闻导语所说是一项很有意义的活动。
    一炉钢是怎么炼出来的？从配料到浇铸有那些环节？生产的许多环节中又存在那些关键问题？所有直接参加生产，天天跟转炉、平炉打交道的人是了如指掌的。而对于生产技术不够熟悉的人，理解就未必那么深刻。“每人每天炼一炉钢”的活动开展以后，一个个问题就直接摆到领导者的面前了。重钢转炉一厂的领导干部开展“每人每天炼一炉钢”的活动，为时仅仅九天，而形势大变：领导人员掌握生产技术的本领更高了，办法更多了，对整个生产情况更觉心中有数了。这样的活动怎能说不是一件很有意义的活动呢？
  领导干部深入第一线有各式各样的活动：掌握生产关键，一直住到关键的口子上去，这是一种活动；以某种主要产品为目标，把这个产品的全线生产抓起来，这又是一种活动。各种各样的活动和做法，都会发现生产上的一些具体问题，并且直接解决一些具体问题。然而，作为掌握全面的领导人员来说，抓住主要产品，亲自动手，种一块“试验田”，在生产实践中总结生产经验，推动生产前进，其意义和影响则更为重大。两年前，全党全民大搞钢铁，许多来自农村的农民根本没有炼铁经验，当时，报纸提出党委书记亲临钢铁最前线的号召，各地很快就出现了“书记睡到炉边去，一炉升火万炉红”的壮阔美景。今天，各地对钢铁生产的领导经验比过去更加丰富了；重钢转炉一厂干部参加炼钢活动的经验普遍传播，我们的钢铁战线将会出现更美的景色。
    当然，这个活动的重要的意义还不止于此。更重要还在于技术上给予领导人员一次考验。技术不是神秘的。据重钢转炉一厂8月1日到9日的统计，全厂的钢产水平比上月同期增长了76％，合格率上升了9.4％。这种大幅度的增长情况，反映了领导干部钻研技术有很大的成就；但是，这不能简单地看做钻研技术的结果，技术是为政治服务的，政治挂帅挂到技术上，炼钢炉上才射发出更新的高产优质的光芒。
    我们的钢铁生产正面临着一个新的形势，这个形势，要求我们的领导工作更加深入、更加踏实、更加具体。重钢转炉一厂开展的干部炼钢活动，就是一项有深远意义的经验。
