Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 29th: The Erqi People's Commune in Zhengzhou, through its Jiefang Road Branch's Machinery Repair Factory, is vigorously manufacturing indigenous machinery and equipment to equip itself, leading to thriving production.

In the past month alone, the machinery and equipment successfully trial-produced and put into use by this factory include four-purpose lathes, air compressors, spring hammers, and gas stoves. The factory now possesses a total of 53 pieces of machinery and equipment, 37 of which were manufactured by themselves.

Upon entering the factory, one immediately notices many machines made from waste materials. The wire rolling machine is made of several old gears and an old ironing board; the frames of boring machines, shapers, nail making machines, and wire drawing machines are all built with cement and broken bricks and tiles. Although these machines are extremely rudimentary, they are all electrically powered, generally increasing efficiency dozens of times compared to manual operations. Currently, over 80% of the factory's production processes have shifted from manual to semi-mechanized or mechanized, and the product range has expanded from the initial few simple handmade products to the ability to manufacture nearly fifty kinds of more complex products such as generators, motors, and welding machines.

When the factory was first established, it only had five pairs of pliers. The workers were mostly housewives who did not understand production technology and could only produce a few simple handmade products such as iron ladles, cattle muzzles, and iron sieves. With the development of production, there was a need to add some electrically powered, more complex machines and equipment. The factory's Party branch launched a mass movement to vigorously manufacture indigenous machinery and equipment. Workers drew their own designs without blueprints, made their own tools without equipment, used waste products from nearby factories or commercial departments without materials, and learned from all available sources without technology. They exhausted all means to overcome difficulties. Everyone worked tirelessly. Some people's hands were blistered, their eyes were bloodshot, and they still refused to rest even after repeated urging. The district committee secretary and the factory's female director also frequently went to the site to study with the workers.

In the process of manufacturing machinery and equipment, this factory gradually developed from small to large. When the factory initially produced handmade products such as iron ladles and cattle muzzles, it had many leftover scraps of iron wire. To turn the useless into useful and to make urgently needed wire nails for the market, they manufactured the factory's first batch of machinery and equipment – twelve indigenous nail making machines. To manufacture the indigenous nail making machines, the factory established a casting workshop and a forging workshop. The machine tools for repairing machine parts lacked motors, so the workers built their own motors, and after they were made, they established a motor workshop specializing in processing and manufacturing motors. In this way, one link led to another, and machine repair and welding workshops were also established. Thus, a factory that relied on handmade iron sieves two years ago was transformed into a fully equipped machinery repair factory. Its main products not only supply the basic construction units in Zhengzhou, but also greatly support the needs of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project, the newly built Yellow River Bridge, and other construction aspects.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 29th: In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the Xuanwu People's Commune in Nanjing vigorously attacked heavy manual labor and cumbersome manual operations, developing production and improving working conditions.

The Xuanwu Commune is located in the northeastern corner of the ancient city of Jinling, with 293 industrial production units and over 10,070 production personnel, of which more than 80% are women. The commune-run industry developed on the basis of the mass movement to run industries by the whole people in 1958. Initially, each factory generally had only three to five workers, a few pairs of pliers and files, and simple factory buildings, some even producing in caves. By the end of last year, more than 90% of the workers were still engaged in manual operations and heavy manual labor, resulting in low production efficiency. The workers said: In this Great Leap Forward, we must also make the "old ox cart" grow wings! Thus, a surge of technical innovation and technical revolution was set off.

Under the leadership of the commune's Party committee, the workers focused on the weak links in production, heavy manual labor, and complicated manual operations. After identifying the key issues, they concentrated their efforts to attack them within a limited time to promote production. The Red Machinery Factory, which processes screws and forges copper plates for some large factories, could only forge a maximum of 30 jin of copper plates per day after workers swung a 24-pound hammer all day due to the lack of mechanical equipment, which was far from meeting the processing needs of large factories. The factory leadership led the workers to attack the forging workshop, proposing the slogan of "press the button to forge iron." After several days of hard work, they finally made a double-headed spring hammer with scattered angle iron and some scrap materials. As long as one person controlled the switch, it was equivalent to 38 people swinging a hammer. As the forging production leapt forward, it forced other types of work to keep up. Indigenous equipment such as lathes, planers, and twisting machines were also successively trial-produced. Now, the Red Machinery Factory has basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization, and production efficiency has more than doubled. The Yangtze River Tire Retreading Factory originally peeled tires manually, and it took ten workers two or three hours to peel one tire. During operation, workers sometimes had to bend over, sometimes had to lie on the ground. Tires from tractors, cars, and other vehicles were urgently needed for retreading from various places, but they could not be delivered early due to the bottleneck of tire peeling. Recently, under the leadership of the commune's Party committee, the factory director, along with two experienced workers, drew their own designs, found their own waste materials, and successfully manufactured a tire peeling machine. Using the tire peeling machine, only two people are needed to do auxiliary work, and a tire can be peeled in three minutes, and production is also very safe. This workshop, which started from a few family members of workers from the Nanjing Rubber Factory repairing rubber shoes, has now become a factory for retreading various types of tires.

As a result of the Xuanwu Commune's technical innovation and technical revolution movement over the past few months, most workers have been freed from heavy manual labor and complicated manual operations. Commune-run industries now have more than ten industries, including mechanical and electrical, telecommunications instruments, building materials, and daily necessities, producing more than 1,000 kinds of products such as motors, cement, and clothing.

    南京玄武公社开展技术革新改善劳动条件
    新华社郑州29日电　郑州市二七人民公社解放路分社机械修配厂大造土机器设备，自己武装自己，使生产蒸蒸日上。
    近一个月来，这个工厂试制成功并开始使用的机械设备，就有四用车床、空气压缩机、弹簧锤、煤气炉等。现在全厂共有机器设备五十三部，其中有三十七部是自己制造出来的。
    走进工厂，一眼就会看见许多用废料造成的机器。轧丝机是几个旧牙轮和一个旧案板做成的；镗床、牛头刨、制钉机、拔丝机等的车架，全是用洋灰和碎砖瓦块砌成的。这些机器设备虽然极其简陋，但都是电力带动，一般比手工操作提高工效数十倍。现在，全厂80％以上的生产工序已由手工操作变为半机械化或机械化，产品品种也由最初的几种简单手工产品，发展到能够制造发电机、马达、电焊机等近五十种比较复杂的产品。
    这个厂在初建立的时候，只有五把铁钳子，工人大多数是家庭妇女、不懂生产技术，每天只生产些铁笊篱、牛笼嘴和铁筛子等几种简单的手工产品。随着生产的发展，需要添置一些电力带动的比较复杂的机器设备。工厂党支部发动职工掀起了一个大造土机器设备的群众运动。工人们没有图纸自己画，没有工具自己打，没有材料就利用附近工厂或商业部门的废品，没有技术就到处访师问友，就这样想尽了各种办法来克服困难。大家热火朝天的苦干，有的人手磨破了，眼熬红了，几经催促仍不肯去休息，区委书记和工厂女厂长也时常深入现场和工人们一起研究。
    在制造机器设备的过程中，这个厂从小到大逐步发展起来。工厂在最初编造铁笊篱、牛笼嘴等手工产品时，剩下许多碎铁丝，为了变无用为有用，把这些碎铁丝制成市场上迫切需要的元钉，他们制成了全厂第一批机器设备——十二部土制钉机。为了制造土制钉机，全厂建立了铸造车间和锻工车间。修配机器零件的机床没有马达，工人们便自己动手造马达，制成以后就又成立了电机车间，专门加工制造马达。这样一环套一环，又建立了机修车间和电焊车间。就这样，一个二年前靠手工编铁筛的工厂，脱胎换骨，成为设备俱全的机械修配厂。主要产品不仅供应郑州市各基本建设单位，而且大批支援了三门峡水利枢纽工程、新建黄河大桥等建设方面的需要。
    新华社南京29日电　南京市玄武人民公社在技术革新和技术革命运动中，猛攻笨重体力劳动和笨重手工操作，发展了生产，改善了劳动条件。
    玄武公社位于金陵古城的东北角，现有二百九十三个工业生产单位，一万零七十多个生产人员，其中80％以上是妇女。社办工业是在1958年全民大办工业的基础上发展起来的。起初，每个工厂一般只有三五个工人，几把老虎钳子和锉刀，间把厂房，有的甚至在山洞里生产。到去年年底，仍有90％以上的工人从事手工操作和笨重体力劳动，生产效率不高。工人们说：在这大跃进中，我们也要“老牛车”长翅膀！于是，掀起了技术革新和技术革命的热潮。
    职工们在公社党委的领导下，抓生产上的薄弱环节，抓笨重的体力劳动和繁杂的手工操作，找出关键后集中力量围攻，限期突破，以推动生产。为一些大厂加工螺丝和锻制铜板的赤色机械厂，因为没有机械设备，工人们挥舞着二十四磅的大锤干上一天，最多只能锻三十斤铜板，远远不能满足大厂加工需要。厂的领导带领工人围攻锻工车间，提出“打铁按电钮”的口号，经过几天奋战，终于用零星的三角铁和一些废旧材料制成一台双头弹簧锤，只要一人掌握开关，就等于三十八人抡大锤干的活。锻工生产跃上去，逼着其他工种跟上，车床、刨床、绞丝机等土设备也接连试制出来。现在赤色机械厂已基本上实现了机械化和半机械化，生产效率一翻再翻。长江轮胎翻新厂原来是人工剥胎，十个工人花上两三小时才能剥一只。操作时，工人有时要弓着身子，有时要躺在地上，各地送来翻新的拖拉车、汽车等轮胎，都急等着要，可是被剥胎关卡住，不能及早交出。最近在公社党委的领导下，厂长带着两个老师傅，自画图样，自找废料，制造成功一部剥胎机。使用剥胎机，只要两个人做辅助工，三分钟就可剥一只轮胎，生产也很安全。这个由南京制胶厂几个工人家属搞修补胶鞋起家的工场，现在已成为翻新各种类型轮胎的工厂。
    玄武公社几个月来开展技术革新和技术革命运动的结果，大多数工人摆脱了笨重体力劳动和繁杂手工操作。社办工业已有机械电机、电讯仪表、建筑材料、日用百货等十多个行业，生产电动机、水泥、服装等一千多种产品。
