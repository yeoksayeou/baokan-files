    Getting to the Bottom of Things
    Feng Lin, First Secretary of the Shou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Anhui Province
    There is a saying: “Break the clay pot and ask about the bottom, and even ask where the shards are.” It means that some people are always fond of getting to the root of things, having the determination to "not give up until the root is dug out." Is this approach good? We say it is! It's good because of the "asking," and valuable because of the "detail." In our Shou County's Niankou Commune, there is a Party General Branch Secretary named Li Guangxuan, who is such a comrade who "never tires of asking." Two things he did recently have given me considerable inspiration.
    During the summer planting season, he went to the Beiji Production Team to inspect production and found that the team's summer planting progress was very slow. What was the reason? Upon inspection, it turned out that four of the sixteen oxen were idle. Why weren't the oxen being used? Upon further questioning, it was because there were no ropes to harness them. But why weren't they acquired? It turned out that the team didn't have hemp, and the commercial department hadn't allocated any. What solution could be found? He pondered. Suddenly, he remembered seeing nine ropes tied to the roof beams, unused, at the Qigang Production Team. He immediately went there to borrow them. At the same time, he mobilized thirty oxen from a neighboring team to provide support. As a result, the team's daily summer planting progress increased from more than twenty mu to more than one hundred and thirty mu, completing the summer planting task more than twenty days ahead of schedule.
    On another occasion, he went to the Laowei Production Team and found that the team's labor efficiency was very low, with each person tilling less than four fen of land per day. Why was the work efficiency low? The team cadres told him that it was mainly because there were many women. Why was the work efficiency of women low? Upon further questioning, it turned out that the nurseries hadn't been set up, and the women were being held back by their children. Why hadn't the nurseries been set up? It turned out that the team cadres were not concerned about it. Why weren't the team cadres concerned? Upon investigation, the team cadres were all young and didn't have children at home, so they couldn't appreciate the difficulties of women with children and hadn't focused on nursery work. After he dug out the root of the problem, he educated the team cadres and helped to set up the nurseries. As a result, the women were freed from the entanglement of their children and threw themselves into field labor, and labor efficiency increased dramatically.
    Not only ask, but ask more – this is the inspiration we have gained from the above two things. Li Guangxuan himself also has such logic: "Look more to find clues, ask more to find the root cause, and tangled threads can also be straightened out." Therefore, he is particularly thorough and meticulous in his work, and he is good at solving specific problems for those below, so the masses praised him: "No matter what strange and difficult diseases, in the hands of our Secretary Li, it is guaranteed that the medicine will cure the disease." This is not to say that Li Guangxuan is "Hua Tuo reincarnated" and can "bring the dead back to life" with all diseases, but the secret lies in the fact that he is not satisfied with a superficial understanding, but specifically applies the Marxist-Leninist method of analyzing things in specific work, and has learned to carefully observe and find the crux of the problem from more looking and asking, and then prescribe the right medicine, of course, this can achieve the effect of curing the disease. But how can we find the root cause from the complicated phenomena? Then we must have the spirit of "breaking the clay pot and asking to the end."
    Asking or not asking, asking more or asking less, these are two completely different attitudes. Li Guangxuan belongs to the former; but there are also many cadres who belong to the latter. Although they are at the grassroots level, or have come to the grassroots level, they are deep but not penetrating, and they disdain to interfere in some specific problems. Even if they ask a question, they only say a few words and leave. These people not only have not realized the harm of this practice, but also say plausibly: "Leaders, just grasp the principles." The implication is that specific problems are trivial matters and there is no need to waste energy on them. But they do not know that many, many specific problems are specific manifestations of principle problems. The above-mentioned helping to borrow a few ropes and helping to set up nurseries may seem like ordinary trivial matters, but they have achieved extraordinary results. As a commander, is it not worth asking more about such "trivial matters"?
    "Water has a source, and trees have roots." If a doctor cannot determine the source of the patient's illness, he will not cure the disease; if a leader does not have an in-depth and specific understanding of the work, he will not do the work well. But how can we find the root of things? There are three answers: one is the most fundamental and most important method, to seriously study Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist working method of carefully observing and analyzing things; the second is to face the masses and "consult" with the masses; and the third is to have the determination to "break the clay pot and ask to the end." As long as we can do these things, we will definitely be able to find out the source of the disease and be effective in every treatment. Only in this way can we truly use the principle of "combining the general with the individual" well, and not fall into bureaucracy or get stuck in a rut.
    Solving specific problems one by one is the responsibility of a leader, as well as the leadership art and work style of a leader. How can we achieve this? Let us review Chairman Mao's teachings in the preface to "Rural Surveys," seriously overcome the work style of "being careless and not seeking thorough understanding," and do the work deeper and deeper, more meticulously and more meticulously, because: "Without a truly specific understanding, there will be no truly good leadership."

### 打破沙锅问到底

    打破沙锅问到底	中共安徽寿县县委第一书记　冯林
    有一句俗语：“打破沙锅问到底，还问锅碴在那里。”意思是说有的人对事物总爱寻根究底，有“事不刨根不罢休”的决心。这种作风好不好呢？我们说好！它好在一个“问”字上，贵在一个“细”字上。我们寿县埝口公社有个名叫李广轩的党总支书记，就是这样一个“百问不烦”的同志。他最近作了两件事，对我启示不小。
    夏种时，他到北集生产队检查生产，发现这个队夏种进度很慢，什么原因呢？一检查，原来十六条耕牛，就有四条闲着没用。为什么有牛不用呢？又一问，是没有套牛的绳索。但又为什么不添置呢？原来队里没有麻，商业部门未调到。想什么办法解决呢？他思索着。忽然想起一次在齐岗生产队看到有九根绳索，拴在梁头上，闲着没用。便立即到那里借来。同时，又从邻队动员了三十头耕牛来支援，结果，使这个队的夏种日进度由二十多亩，增加到一百三十多亩，提前二十多天完成了夏种任务。
    又一次，他到老圩生产队，发现这个队的劳动效率很低，每人每天锄不到四分地。工效为什么低呢？队干部告诉他，主要是妇女多。为什么妇女的工效低呢？一追问，原来是托儿所没有办起来，妇女叫孩子拖住了腿。托儿所又为什么没有办起来呢？原来是队干部不关心的缘故。为什么队干部不关心呢？一了解，队干部都是青年，家里没有小孩，他们体会不到有孩子的妇女的难处，所以没有把托儿所工作放在心上。他把这个问题的根子刨出来以后，就一面教育队干部，一面帮助把托儿所办了起来，从而使妇女摆脱了孩子的纠缠，投入了田间劳动，劳动效率猛增一倍。
    不光要问，还要多问，这是我们从上述两件事情上得到的启示。李广轩本人也有这样的逻辑：“多看找苗头，多问找根由，乱丝也能理出头。”所以他对待工作，就特别深入细致，善于替下面解决一个个具体问题，因而群众赞扬道：“不管什么奇难疑症，到我们李书记手里，包管药到病除。”这到不是说李广轩是“华陀再世”，百病到他手里都能够“妙手回春”，秘诀就在于他不满足于一知半解，而在具体工作中具体运用了马克思列宁主义分析事物的方法，学会了精心观察，从多看多问当中把问题的症结找出来，然后投以药石，当然这就能够收到药到病除之效。但怎样才能够从纷纭复杂的现象中把根子找出来呢？那就非要有“打破沙锅问到底”的精神不可。
    问与不问，多问与少问，这是截然不同的两种态度，李广轩是属于前者；但还有不少干部是属于后者。他们虽然身在基层，或者也来到了基层，但却是深而不入，对一些具体问题，不屑插手，纵然问上一问，也是三言两语，飘然而去。这些人不仅没有发觉这种作风的危害性，还振振有词地说：“领导嘛，只要抓原则问题。”言外之意，具体问题都是些琐事，不必去浪费精力。但他们殊不知很多很多具体问题，却都是原则问题的具体体现，上面所提到的帮助下面借几根绳索，帮助办托儿所，虽然看来是件平常的琐事，但却收到了不平常的效果。像这样的“琐事”，作为一个指挥员，难道不值得去多多地问上一问吗？
    “水有源，树有根”，一个医生断不清患者的病源，他就不会把病治好；一个领导者，对工作不做深入具体的了解，他同样就不会把工作做好。但怎样才能把事物根源找出来呢？答复有三：一是最根本最重要的方法，要认真学习毛主席那种精心观察和分析事物的马列主义的工作方法；二要面向群众，和群众一道来“会诊”；三要有“打破沙锅问到底”的决心。只要做到这几条，就一定能够查清病源，百疗百效。同时也只有这样，也才能真正运用好“一般与个别相结合”的原则，而不致陷于事务主义中，钻到牛角尖里去。
    解决一个个的具体问题，这是一个领导者的责任，也是领导者的领导艺术问题和工作作风问题。怎样才能做到这一点呢？还是让我们来温习一下毛主席在“农村调查”序言一文中给我们的教导，认真地克服那种“粗枝大叶，不求甚解”的工作作风，把工作做得深些更深一些，细致更细致一些，因为：“没有真正具体的了解，真正好的领导是不会有的。”
