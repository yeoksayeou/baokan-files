Another Example of Peaceful Coexistence

    Invited by the friendly neighbor on the Pamir Plateau – Afghanistan, Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi visited Afghanistan with the profound friendship of the Chinese people. During the visit, Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the celebrations of the 42nd anniversary of Afghanistan's Independence Day, and celebrated this great festival of the Afghan people with the Afghan people. At the same time, Vice Premier Chen Yi held friendly talks with Afghan Prime Minister Sardar Mohammed Daoud, Deputy Prime Minister Ali Mohammed, and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sardar Mohammed Naim, achieving complete success. The two countries issued a joint communique and concluded the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Afghanistan. The signing of this treaty is a new victory for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, and is of great significance for promoting Asian-African solidarity and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.
    For thousands of years, China and Afghanistan have lived in harmony. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1955, under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries have developed well. In January and October 1957, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and Afghan Prime Minister Sardar Mohammed Daoud exchanged visits; in September last year, Afghan Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sardar Mohammed Naim also visited China. Now, His Majesty King Mohammed Zahir of the Kingdom of Afghanistan has accepted the invitation of Chinese Chairman Liu Shaoqi to pay a friendly visit to China. The mutual visits of leaders of the two countries have continuously enhanced the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. Now, this friendly and cooperative relationship has entered a new stage due to the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between the two countries.
    The Sino-Afghan Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression, like the Treaty of Friendship signed between China and Yemen more than two years ago, and the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression signed between China and Burma and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship signed between China and Nepal this year, are all concrete extensions and developments of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. These treaties not only legally fix the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Afghanistan, Yemen, Burma, and Nepal, but also set an example for peaceful coexistence among Asian countries. After shaking off imperialist oppression, Asian countries all need a peaceful environment to develop their economies, to get rid of the poverty and backwardness imposed on us by imperialist plunder and aggression, and need to support each other in the struggle against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace. Therefore, although Asian countries have different social systems, they have common interests and foundations, and they can maintain and develop mutual friendly and cooperative relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between them. As for some problems left over from history and other possible disputes, they can be completely resolved through peaceful consultation. As the Sino-Afghan Joint Communique pointed out: "All disputes between Asian and African countries can be resolved fairly and reasonably in the spirit of friendly cooperation, mutual understanding and mutual respect." The recent smooth resolution of the Sino-Burmese and Sino-Nepalese border issues eloquently proves this point.
    The governments and peoples of China and Afghanistan have been making joint efforts to promote Asian-African solidarity and support the anti-colonialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples. The joint communique reaffirmed "support for the peoples and countries that have not yet achieved independence in their struggle for complete independence; and are convinced that the struggle of these peoples and countries against colonialism, for freedom, and for the right to determine their future in accordance with their freely expressed will is just and will eventually be victorious." This is of great practical significance today. The national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are developing rapidly. Since the beginning of this year, fifteen countries have achieved varying degrees of independence, and the colonial system is further disintegrating. However, the colonialist forces will not be reconciled to failure and are doing their best to struggle. American imperialism is stepping up its interference and aggression against the people of the Congo and Cuba. Therefore, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America must strengthen unity, support each other, and persist in the struggle against colonialism and imperialism in order to achieve and maintain national independence.
    The government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan has consistently pursued a policy of peace and neutrality, has made beneficial contributions to peace in Asia and the world, and has won high praise and sincere support from China and all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world. This time, the talks between the leaders of China and Afghanistan once again expressed the common desire of the two peoples to safeguard world peace. The joint communique of the two countries stated that "they hope that the leaders of all countries in the world will dedicate themselves to eliminating international tensions and conducting peaceful consultations in order to safeguard world peace. The two sides also expressed their hope and willingness to see the upcoming discussions on disarmament achieve success."
    The Chinese people are a peace-loving people. Six hundred and fifty million liberated Chinese people are determined to use their hardworking hands to rapidly change the poor and blank backwardness of their country. Now, the Chinese people are carrying out socialist construction with full confidence and at a high speed. We need a long-term international peaceful environment. Therefore, the Chinese government and people have always firmly implemented a peaceful foreign policy and advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Our country, together with India and Burma, jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and then together with Asian and African countries, created the ten principles of the Bandung Conference. Our country has also actively developed friendly and cooperative relations with Asian and African countries on the basis of these principles. The Chinese government has repeatedly proposed that all countries in the Asian and Pacific region, including the United States, conclude a treaty of mutual non-aggression and peace to make this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone. As Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "China not only sincerely hopes to live in harmony with all its neighbors, but also sincerely hopes that peace in Asia and the world can be guaranteed."
    We firmly believe that the peaceful and friendly cooperative relations between our country and Afghanistan and other Asian and African countries will be increasingly consolidated and developed under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, thereby making greater contributions to promoting the unity of Asian and African countries and safeguarding world peace.

### 和平共处的又一榜样

    和平共处的又一榜样
    我国陈毅副总理兼外交部长带着中国人民的深挚友情，应邀访问帕米尔高原的友好邻邦——阿富汗。在访问期间，陈毅副总理参加了阿富汗独立节四十二周年的庆典，和阿富汗人民一起欢庆阿富汗人民的这一伟大节日。同时，陈毅副总理同阿富汗王国首相萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德、副首相阿里·穆罕默德和副首相兼外交大臣萨达尔·穆罕默德·纳伊姆举行了友好会谈，取得了圆满的结果。两国发表了联合公报，并缔结了中华人民共和国和阿富汗王国友好和互不侵犯条约。这一条约的签订，是和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的一个新的胜利，对于促进亚非团结、维护亚洲和世界和平具有重大意义。
    几千年来，中阿两国一直和睦相处。自从1955年建立外交关系后，在和平共处原则和万隆精神的指导下，两国的友好合作关系有了良好的发展。1957年1月和10月，我国周恩来总理和阿富汗王国萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德首相进行了互相访问；去年9月，阿富汗王国萨达尔·穆罕默德·纳伊姆副首相兼外交大臣又访问了我国。现在，阿富汗王国国王穆罕默德·查希尔陛下已接受我国刘少奇主席的邀请，将前来我国进行友好访问。两国领导人的互相访问，不断增进着两国的友好合作关系。现在，这种友好合作关系，由于两国签订了友好和互不侵犯条约，已进入一个新阶段。
    中阿友好和互不侵犯条约，同两年多以前中国和也门签订的友好条约，今年以来中缅签订的友好和互不侵犯条约，中尼签订的和平友好条约一样，都是和平共处五项原则的具体引伸和发展。这些条约，不仅把我国同阿富汗、也门、缅甸和尼泊尔之间友好合作关系用法律的形式固定下来，而且为亚洲国家之间和平共处作出了范例。亚洲国家在摆脱帝国主义压迫之后，都需要有一个和平环境来发展自己的经济，摆脱帝国主义掠夺和侵略所加给我们的贫困和落后，需要在反对帝国主义侵略和维护世界和平的斗争中相互支持。因此，尽管亚洲国家的社会制度有所不同，但有着共同的利益和基础，它们能够在互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则的基础上，保持和发展相互的友好合作关系。它们之间没有根本的利害冲突。至于历史上遗留下来的某些问题以及其他可能发生的争端，完全可以通过和平协商求得解决。正如中阿两国联合公报指出的：“亚非各国之间的一切争端，是完全有可能本着友好合作和互相谅解、互相尊重的精神求得公平合理的解决的”。最近中缅、中尼边界问题的顺利解决，就雄辩地证明了这一点。
    中阿两国政府和人民一直在为促进亚非团结、支持亚非人民的反殖民主义斗争，作着共同的努力。联合公报重申，“支持那些尚未取得独立的人民和国家争取完全的独立；并且深信，这些人民和国家反对殖民主义、争取自由和按照他们自由表达的意愿决定他们的未来的权利的斗争是正义的，终将获得胜利。”这在今天，具有重要的现实意义。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲民族独立运动正在迅猛发展。今年以来，已有十五个国家取得了不同程度的独立，殖民制度在进一步瓦解中。但是，殖民主义势力是不会甘心失败的，千方百计地进行挣扎。美帝国主义正在加紧对刚果和古巴人民进行干涉和侵略。因之，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民必须加强团结，互相支持，坚持斗争，反对殖民主义和帝国主义，才能取得和维护民族独立。
    阿富汗王国政府一贯奉行和平中立政策，对亚洲和世界和平做出了有益的贡献，获得了中国和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的很高评价和衷心的支持。这一次中阿两国领导人的会谈，又一次表达了两国人民维护世界和平的共同愿望。两国联合公报表示，“希望世界各国的领导人将致力于消除国际紧张局势，进行和平协商，以维护世界和平。双方并且表示希望和愿意看到即将举行的关于裁军问题的讨论获得成就。”
    中国人民是热爱和平的人民。六亿五千万解放了的中国人民，决心要用自己勤劳的双手，迅速地改变自己国家的一穷二白的落后面貌。现在，中国人民正在信心百倍地高速度地进行着社会主义建设。我们需要一个长期的国际和平环境。因此，中国政府和人民始终坚定地执行着和平外交政策，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处。我国同印度、缅甸曾经共同倡导了和平共处五项原则，接着又同亚洲、非洲国家一起缔造了万隆会议的十项原则。我国并在这些原则的基础上积极发展同亚洲、非洲国家的友好合作关系。我国政府一再建议亚洲和太平洋地区各国，包括美国在内，缔结一个互不侵犯的和平公约，使这个地区成为无核武器区。正如陈毅副总理所说的：“中国不仅诚心诚意地希望同自己所有的邻邦和睦相处，而且诚心诚意地希望亚洲和世界的和平也能得到保证。”
    我们深信，我国同阿富汗以及其它亚非国家之间的和平友好合作关系，在和平共处五项原则的指导下，必将日益巩固和发展，从而对促进亚非各国的团结和维护世界和平作出更大的贡献。
