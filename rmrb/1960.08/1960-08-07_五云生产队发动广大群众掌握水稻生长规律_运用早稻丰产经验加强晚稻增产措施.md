    The Wuyun Production Team Mobilizes the Masses to Master Rice Growth Patterns and Applies Early Rice Abundance Experience to Strengthen Late Rice Production Measures

    (Our report) The Wuyun Production Team of Donghu Commune in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, mobilized the masses to summarize early rice abundance experience on the spot, improving the scientific and technical level of cadres and commune members, increasing their awareness of implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and strengthening late rice production measures.

    The early rice harvest of the Wuyun Production Team was achieved under new circumstances. First, the cropping system was changed on a large scale, with the new triple cropping system (i.e., continuous rice cultivation in rapeseed and wheat fields) accounting for half of the total early rice area of 642 mu. Second, almost all of the new varieties such as "Lucai No. 1" were used. Third, the cultivation methods were changed, with direct seeding of early rice accounting for 30%. In terms of yield, this year's early rice growth in some spring flower fields (wheat) exceeded that of green manure fields, and late planting resulted in early maturity and high yield. Summarizing these experiences has opened up avenues for promoting high yields of late rice this year and for further implementing "more planting, high yield, and more harvesting" in the future.

      More Planting, More Harvesting

    The rice fields of the First Team and the Third Team of the Wuyun Production Team are connected, and the labor force and land area are equal, but the early rice yields differ greatly. The First Team actively promoted the new triple cropping system, planting more early rice, accounting for 88% of the total area, of which 52% was spring flower fields. The early rice grew tall, with large ears and many grains. However, the Third Team adhered to old conventions, fearing a shortage of labor, believing that planting less was better than planting more, and the early rice expansion plan was not completed. Commune members participating in the summary of abundance experience selected a plot of early rice in a green manure field in the Third Team and a plot of early rice in a spring flower field in the First Team. After actual measurement, the estimated yield per mu of the First Team was estimated to be 140 jin higher than that of the Third Team.

    However, Jin Yaoming, the captain of the Third Team, was still unconvinced. He said: Although early rice in spring flower fields is good, the yield of late rice may not necessarily be good. His reason was: Early rice in spring flower fields has more late-maturing varieties, the harvest period is late, the summer harvest and summer planting season is tight, and there is not enough labor after planting more. Everyone presented facts to him: A plot of early rice in a spring flower field in the Fifth Team, a "Lucai No. 1" variety, was transplanted on May 20, with a seedling age of forty-five days. After transplanting, it grew rapidly and matured three days earlier than early rice in a green manure field that was planted twenty days earlier, and the yield was also about fifty jin higher. In the face of the facts, Jin Yaoming affirmed the benefits of the new cropping system and said that he would definitely guarantee the completion of the expansion plan in late rice production, and that late rice must surpass early rice.

    Rice Sturdy and Not Lodging

    How to make early rice grow well without lodging and reduce empty grains? Everyone selected two plots of early rice fields with roughly the same soil quality, sunlight, and water conservancy conditions but different yields for comparison. The five mu of "Lucai No. 1" early rice managed by veteran commune member Wang Aliu grew very well without lodging. It is estimated that the yield per mu can increase by 40% compared to last year. However, the three mu of early rice managed by Jin Shuigen lodged, and the empty grain rate was as high as 35%. The estimated yield per mu was 250 jin less than that of the field managed by Wang Aliu. What is the reason for this?

    Veteran farmer Wang Aliu introduced his experience. Last year, he managed four mu of direct seeding fields, the variety was Nanteno, which initially grew well, but the leaves were too luxuriant. He took measures to cut the leaves, but still could not control it. He also carried out sunning the field, sunning it until the field soil cracked before irrigating. As a result, wherever the water was irrigated, the rice lodged. In the end, only one corner of the field did not lodge because water often leaked from the neighboring field. This year, he learned from this lesson. In this direct seeding early rice field he manages, in addition to applying sufficient base fertilizer once and fine weeding, he pays special attention to irrigation and sunning. According to this year's climate, there was a lot of rain in the early stage of early rice growth, so he took measures to seize the sunny days and sun the field early, irrigating it when the field cracked with chicken claw patterns. Later, when he encountered drought, he took the method of dry and wet, often maintaining shallow irrigation. As a result, the rice grew very well, the rice stalks were strong and did not lodge, the ears were large, and there were few empty grains. The average empty grain rate was only 16%. After the visit and comparison, everyone believed that Wang Aliu was energetic, good at research, and mastered the growth pattern of early rice. Through appropriate control, he promoted the growth of early rice. Jin Shuigen, on the other hand, superstitious relied on the sky and did not master scientific and technical knowledge, which is the reason for lodging.

      Reasonable Close Planting

    "Is reasonable close planting good?" Through mass summarization and evaluation, the commune members of the Wuyun Production Team further affirmed the benefits of close planting. Everyone agreed that implementing 5×2 cun, with 400,000 seedlings per mu, is a suitable density to ensure increased production. However, different varieties can be slightly higher or lower than this requirement. Commune member Wang Asheng has not been very trusting of close planting for several years. In this summary, he saw a plot of early rice in a spring flower field in the First Team, with a row spacing of 5×2 cun, closely planted with 402,000 seedlings, with an average of sixty grains per ear, and did not lodge at all. Jin Chuanshui, the commune member in charge of this field, introduced his experience: In addition to applying reasonable fertilizer and cultivating strong seedlings, this field also adopted measures such as multiple weeding, opening ditches around the field to sun the field early, and shallow irrigation in the later stage to inhibit excessive growth, make the base strong, and develop the root system.

    Summarizing the experience of early rice abundance directly promoted current production. In the Second Team, there was a plot of late rice with insufficient close planting of seedlings. Team leader Jin Ruyi immediately led three commune members to make up for it overnight. Due to poor management, five mu of continuous late rice seedling fields in the Third Team were without water, and now all have been irrigated.

    The Shaoxing County Party Committee summarized the experience of this team and immediately promoted it throughout the county. Currently, all fifteen communes in the county are universally carrying out the work of mass summarizing abundance experience.

    五云生产队发动广大群众掌握水稻生长规律
    运用早稻丰产经验加强晚稻增产措施
    本报讯　浙江绍兴县东湖公社五云生产队发动广大群众现场总结早稻丰产经验，提高了干部、社员的科学技术水平和贯彻农业“八字宪法”的自觉性，加强了晚稻的增产措施。
    五云生产队早稻丰收是在新情况下获得的。首先是大面积地改变了耕作制度，新三熟制（即油菜、大小麦田种连作稻）面积占早稻总面积六百四十二亩的一半；其次是几乎全部采用了“陆财号”等新品种；第三是改变了耕作方法，直播早稻占30％。从产量来看，今年有的春花田（小麦）早稻生长超过了绿肥田，迟种反而早熟高产。总结这些经验，对促进今年晚稻高产，为今后进一步贯彻“多种、高产、多收”开辟了门路。
      多种多收
    五云生产队的第一小队与第三小队的稻田连在一起，劳力、田亩相等，但早稻产量却相差很大。第一小队由于积极推行新三熟制，早稻插的多，占总面积的88％，其中52％是春花田，早稻长得秆高、穗大、粒多。而第三小队墨守陈规，害怕劳力紧张，认为多种不如少种，早稻扩种计划未完成。参加总结丰产经验的社员在第三小队挑选了一丘绿肥田早稻，在第一小队挑选了一丘春花田早稻，经过实测，第一小队的亩产预计可以比第三小队多收一百四十斤。
    但是第三小队队长金尧明仍旧不服气。他说：春花田早稻虽然好，晚稻产量就不一定好。他的理由是：春花田早稻迟熟品种多，收获期迟，夏收夏种季节紧，多种以后，劳力不够。大家又摆出事实来给他看：五小队一丘春花田早稻，是“陆财号”品种，5月20日插秧，秧龄四十五天，移植后生长迅速，比早种二十天的绿肥田早稻还早熟三天，产量也高出五十斤左右。金尧明在事实面前肯定了新的耕作制度的好处，表示在晚稻生产中一定保证完成扩种计划，定要晚稻超早稻。
    稻壮不倒伏
    怎样使早稻长的好而又不倒和减少秕谷？大家选择了土质、阳光、水利条件大体相同而产量高低不同的两丘早稻田作了对比。老社员王阿六管的五亩“陆财号”早稻长得很好，没有倒伏，据估算亩产可比去年增加40％；而金水根管的三亩早稻倒伏了，秕谷率高达35％，亩产预计要比王阿六管的田少二百五十斤。这究竟是什么道理呢？
    老农王阿六介绍了他的经验。去年他管了四亩直播田，品种是南特号，起初长得不错，但叶过于茂盛，他就采取割叶的办法，可是仍然不能控制，他又进行晒田，一直晒到田土开裂再灌水，这样，水灌到那里，那里的稻子就倒伏；最后只有一只田角，由于邻丘经常有水漏过来，没有倒伏。今年接受了这个教训，他管理的这丘直播早稻田，除基肥一次施足和精细耘田之外，特别重视灌水和晒田的工作。根据今年气候，早稻生长前期多雨，就采取提早抢晴晒田，晒到田裂鸡爪纹就灌水。以后又遇干旱，他就采取干干湿湿的办法，经常保持浅灌。这样做的结果，稻长得很好，稻秆坚硬不倒，穗头大，秕谷少，秕谷率平均只占16％。参观对比之后，大家认为王阿六干劲足，善于钻研，掌握了早稻生长规律，通过适当控制，促进了早稻生长。而金水根迷信靠天，不掌握科学技术，这就是倒伏的原因所在。
      合理密植
    “合理密植好不好？”经过群众性的总结评比，五云生产队的社员对密植的好处，作了进一步的肯定。大家一致认为实行5×2寸，每亩四十万苗，是能够保证增产的适宜密度。但是不同的品种，也可略高或低于这个要求。社员王阿生几年来对密植一直不大相信。这次总结中，他看了一队一丘春花田早稻，行株距5×2寸，密植四十万二千苗，每穗平均有六十粒，一点没有倒伏。专管这丘田的社员金传水介绍了经验：这丘田除了合理施肥、培育壮秧等以外，还采用多耘田，四周开沟早晒田，后期浅灌等措施，达到抑制徒长，基部健壮，根系发达。
    总结早稻丰产经验，直接促进了当前生产。第二小队有一丘晚稻，密植苗数不足，小队长金如意立即带领三个社员连夜补上。第三小队由于管理不周到，五亩连作晚稻秧田断水，现在已全部灌上了水。
    中共绍兴县委总结了这个队的经验，立即在全县推广。现在全县十五个公社正在普遍展开群众性总结丰产经验的工作。
