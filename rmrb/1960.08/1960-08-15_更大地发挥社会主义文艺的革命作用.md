The Third Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers has come to a victorious close. The congress summarized the brilliant achievements and rich experiences of literary and art work since the founding of the nation, further clarified the path of socialist literary and artistic development in our country, and, based on the current excellent situation at home and abroad, put forward the fighting tasks of literary and art work. This was a conference full of ideology and combativeness, a conference filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and demonstrating a high degree of unity, and a conference in which literary and art workers established lofty aspirations.

Following the literary and artistic guidelines established by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, our literary and art workers have delved into the masses of workers and peasants, striven for artistic practice, and created many outstanding works with high ideological and artistic qualities that are loved by the masses, making outstanding contributions to our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Along with the nationwide Great Leap Forward and the cultural revolution, the literary and artistic movement of the workers and peasants has also developed vigorously. Our literature and art have truly become the literature and art of the laboring people themselves. Revolutionary literature, films, dramas, and other artistic works have deeply penetrated the hearts of the broad masses. All the excellent heritage and traditions of the motherland's literature and art have been innovated and developed on a new ideological basis; various forms, themes, and styles of literary and artistic works have gained the opportunity for free development. China's literature and art truly present a vibrant scene of a hundred flowers blooming and a hundred schools of thought contending. A powerful literary and artistic contingent with worker-class literary and art workers as its backbone has been formed. All this proves the correctness of the Party's literary and artistic line and Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, proving that implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend, and weeding through the old to bring forth the new in the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the socialist cause is the most correct and broadest path for developing socialist literature and art.

Literature and art are one of the superstructures of society. Literature and art can play a great promoting role in the development of the socialist economic base, and can also play a great destructive role. Therefore, on the literary and artistic front, there is always a constant struggle between two kinds of literature and art, representing progressive forces and representing reactionary forces. Literature and art in the hands of the working class and laboring people are a sharp weapon to unite, educate, and strike the enemies and eliminate the enemies. Imperialists use reactionary and decadent literature and art to paralyze and poison the people of all countries, and they try every possible means to induce the literature and art of socialist countries to deviate from the socialist path, merging with the dying literature and art of capitalism, in order to serve their delusion of a "peaceful evolution" of socialist countries towards capitalism. Modern revisionists, catering to the needs of imperialism, vigorously advocate bourgeois pacifism, bourgeois hypocritical humanitarianism, and supra-class human nature theory, beautifying capitalism, and defaming socialism, trying to assimilate the socialist ideological system into the bourgeois ideological system, and to turn socialist literature and art into an anti-socialist weapon. Therefore, we must resolutely struggle against this spiritual subversion activity of imperialists and revisionists, and at the same time, further promote the revolutionary and militant nature of our literature and art, so as to more powerfully serve today's socialist construction and the great communist tomorrow, enabling our literature and art to play a greater role in the struggle to consolidate and develop the socialist economic base.

The spokesmen of imperialism, standing on their reactionary position, attack revolutionary literature and art, slandering the revolutionary literature and art which praises the new society, praises the new era, and praises the new heroes of socialism as "embellishing reality." This is utter nonsense. Revolutionary literature and art serve revolutionary politics, which is precisely its noble and glorious task. We sing the praises of socialism and communism, and we eulogize the virtues of the proletariat and the masses of the people. This kind of singing praises and eulogizing virtues greatly benefits the revolutionary cause of the people, and is only unfavorable to imperialism and its running dogs. Modern revisionists and bourgeois reactionary writers and artists vigorously attack revolutionary literature and art on this issue precisely because they are frightened by this reality itself. It is precisely because they fear revolution that they attempt to make revolutionary literature and art degenerate and change, becoming something that distorts revolution and distorts reality. They paint revolutionary reality with dark and gloomy colors, use petty individualistic characters to exclude collectivist heroes, and use bourgeois vulgar tastes to negate the noble style of communism. This is the line of revisionists in literary and artistic creation. Obviously, it is not the proletariat's socialist literature and art that violates the truth, but precisely the stuff advocated by revisionists.

Revolutionary ideals are forever the soul of our socialist literature and art. If this soul is taken away, literature and art will be pale and powerless and will no longer be revolutionary literature and art. Our highest ideal today is communism, an ideal that can be realized and is being realized. Our ideal not only does not exclude, but is precisely built on the basis of a spirit of seeking truth from facts. Therefore, in artistic methods, we advocate the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. Our revolutionary literary and art workers should observe and describe life from the peak of communism, the highest ideal of this era, use communist thought to educate the people, and create more excellent works that truthfully reflect our heroic era and heroic figures, reflect the struggle between new and old things, and guide the broad masses of people to constantly move forward. The socialist literary and art workers of our country, who have inherited the excellent revolutionary traditions and are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have the full responsibility and power to meet this noble demand put forward by the people. Revolutionary literary artists have always linked their work with the greatest interests of the entire proletariat and all mankind, and will forever fight for the interests of the people to the end, forever being proud of being a "cog and screw" in the revolutionary cause, and forever feeling supremely honored to be a revolutionary promoter.

In his congratulatory speech on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, Comrade Lu Dingyi pointed out: "The primary task of our country's literary and artistic work is to use the weapon of literature and art to greatly enhance the socialist and communist ideological awareness of the people of the whole country and to improve the communist moral character of the people of the whole country." This requires literary and art workers across the country to more effectively use the sharp weapon of literature and art and to give fuller play to the revolutionary role of literature and art. The congratulatory speech called on "all those who are loyal to Marxism-Leninism and the revolutionary cause should unite closely, hold high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism of the Moscow Declaration, and thoroughly expose and smash the plots and tricks of imperialists and modern revisionists. In this important and arduous struggle, literary and art workers across the country can and should contribute their strength." The literary and artistic warriors will certainly answer the call of the Party with greater efforts and achievements.

We must continue to implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of literary and art workers, strengthen the great unity of literary and art workers across the country under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought on literature and art, and constantly expand our revolutionary literary and artistic ranks and constantly improve our combat effectiveness. We must unite closely with the writers and artists of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, unite closely with all the revolutionary and progressive writers and artists of Asia, Africa, and Latin America under the banner against imperialism and colonialism, and unite closely with all the revolutionary and progressive writers and artists in the world to jointly struggle against imperialism, for lasting world peace, and for the cause of human progress.

The Third Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers is a rally for revolutionary literary and art workers to continue to leap forward. The Party and the people expect revolutionary literary and artistic warriors to create more good works to serve the great cause of socialism and communism. Our literary and art workers must adhere to the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, carry out an irreconcilable struggle with modern revisionism and all kinds of bourgeois literary and artistic thought; at the same time, greatly strengthen Marxist literary and artistic criticism to promote the healthy development of literary and artistic creation. Our literary and art workers must conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and Comrade Mao Zedong's works, strive to improve their political and ideological level and artistic skills; continue to go deep into the masses of workers and peasants, participate in production labor and practical work, and truly make themselves workers and peasants; use a hundred times a thousand times the effort to advance together with the people of the whole country, and create socialist literary and artistic works that are more magnificent and more brilliant than in any previous era!

Our country's revolutionary literature and art have achieved great results and have been highly evaluated by the Party and the people, but the tasks placed before literary and art workers are arduous, requiring us to continue to make greater efforts, and we have no reason to be complacent in the slightest. In order to strive for greater victory, on the one hand, literary and art workers across the country must have lofty ambitions, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and give full play to the spirit of creation; on the other hand, they must humbly learn, study diligently, be down-to-earth, and work hard, dedicating all their strength to better develop socialist literature and art and climb the peak of revolutionary literature and art!

    更大地发挥社会主义文艺的革命作用
    中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会胜利闭幕了。大会总结了建国以来文艺工作的辉煌成就和丰富经验，进一步明确了我国社会主义文学艺术发展的道路，根据当前国内外大好形势，提出了文艺工作的战斗任务。这是一次富于思想性和战斗性的会议，是充满了革命热情、表现了高度团结的会议，是文艺工作者树雄心、立大志的会议。
    我国文学艺术工作者遵循着党和毛泽东同志所规定的文艺方针，深入工农群众，努力艺术实践，创造了许多思想性和艺术性都很高的、为群众所喜闻乐见的优秀作品，对我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设作出了卓越的贡献。随着全国大跃进和文化革命的形势，工农群众的文艺运动也有了蓬勃的开展。我们的文艺已经成为劳动人民自己的文艺。革命的文学、电影、戏剧和其他各种艺术作品已经深入广大群众的心灵。祖国文学艺术的一切优秀遗产和传统，都在新的思想基础上得到了革新和发展；各种形式、题材和风格的文艺作品都得到了自由发展的机会。我国的文艺真正呈现了万紫千红、百花竞艳的局面。一支以工人阶级文艺家为骨干的强大的文艺队伍已经形成。这一切都证明党的文艺路线、毛泽东文艺思想的正确，证明在为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务的方向下实行百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新，是发展社会主义文艺最正确、最宽广的道路。
    文学艺术是社会的上层建筑之一。文艺对社会主义经济基础的发展能够起极大的促进作用，也能够起极大的破坏作用。因此，在文艺战线上总是不断进行着代表进步力量和代表反动力量的两种文艺的斗争。文艺在工人阶级和劳动人民手中是团结自己、教育自己、打击敌人、消灭敌人的一个锐利武器。帝国主义者则用反动的颓废的文艺来麻痹和毒害各国人民，并且千方百计地诱使社会主义国家的文艺离开社会主义的轨道，而与资本主义的殁落文艺合流，以便为他们妄想使社会主义国家向资本主义的“和平演变”的目的服务。现代修正主义者适应帝国主义的需要，大肆宣扬资产阶级和平主义、资产阶级虚伪的人道主义和超阶级的人性论，美化资本主义，诋毁社会主义，力图使社会主义思想体系同化于资产阶级思想体系，使社会主义文艺变成反社会主义的武器。因此，我们必须对帝国主义者和修正主义者的这种精神上的颠覆活动作坚决的斗争，同时更高度地发扬我们文艺的革命性和战斗性，以便更有力地为今天的社会主义建设和伟大的共产主义明天服务，使我们的文学艺术在巩固和发展社会主义经济基础的斗争中发挥更大的力量。
    帝国主义的代言人站在他们的反动立场上攻击革命的文学艺术，把革命的文学艺术歌颂新社会、歌颂新时代、歌颂社会主义的新英雄人物，诋毁为“粉饰现实”。这完全是胡说。革命的文学艺术是为革命的政治服务的，这正是它的崇高的光荣的任务。我们歌的是社会主义、共产主义之功，颂的是无产阶级和人民大众之德。这种歌功颂德，大大有利于人民的革命事业，仅仅不利于帝国主义和它的走狗们。现代修正主义者和资产阶级反动文人，在这个问题上极力攻击革命的文学艺术，正是因为他们对这个现实本身发生了恐惧。正是由于他们恐惧革命，才企图使革命文艺堕落变质，成为歪曲革命、歪曲现实的东西。他们给革命的现实涂上灰暗阴郁的色彩，用渺小的个人主义的人物来排斥集体主义的英雄，用资产阶级的低级趣味来取消共产主义的高尚风格。这就是修正主义者在文艺创作上的路线。很显然，违背真实的，不是无产阶级的社会主义的文艺，而正是修正主义者所鼓吹的货色。
    革命理想，永远是我们社会主义文学艺术的灵魂，抽去了这个灵魂，文学艺术就会苍白无力，不再成为革命的文艺了。我们今天的最高理想就是共产主义，这是能够实现和正在实现的理想。我们的理想，不但不排斥、而且正是建筑在求实精神的基础之上的。因此，在艺术方法上，我们提倡革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义的结合。我们的革命文艺家们，应当从共产主义这一时代最高理想的峰顶来观察和描写生活，用共产主义思想来教育人民，更多地创造出真实地反映我们的英雄时代和英雄人物、反映新事物和旧事物斗争的优秀作品，引导广大人民不断前进。继承了优良革命传统、以毛泽东思想武装起来的我国的社会主义文艺工作者，完全有责任也有力量满足人民群众所提出的这个崇高的要求。革命的文学艺术家，从来是把自己的工作同整个无产阶级和全人类的最大利益联系在一起的，并且永远为人民的利益奋斗到底，永远以能够作为革命事业中的一个“齿轮和螺丝钉”而自豪，永远以做一个革命的促进派而感到无上光荣。
    陆定一同志代表党中央和国务院所作的祝词中指出：“我国文学艺术工作的首要任务，就是用文艺的武器，极大地提高全国人民社会主义和共产主义的思想觉悟，提高全国人民共产主义的道德品质。”这就是要求全国文学艺术工作者更有效地运用文学艺术这个犀利的武器，更大地发挥文学艺术的革命作用。祝词号召“一切忠实于马克思列宁主义和革命事业的人，应当紧密地团结起来，高举莫斯科宣言的马克思列宁主义的革命旗帜，彻底揭穿和粉碎帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的阴谋诡计。在这一场重要的艰巨的斗争中，全国的文学艺术工作者可以而且应当贡献出自己的力量。”文艺战士们一定会以更大的努力和成就来回答党的号召。
    我们必须继续贯彻执行百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，高度发挥文学艺术工作者的积极性和创造性，加强在毛泽东文艺思想旗帜下的全国文学艺术工作者的大团结，使我们的革命文学艺术队伍不断壮大，不断提高战斗力。我们必须同苏联和其他兄弟国家的作家艺术家在马克思列宁主义旗帜下紧密地团结起来，同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的一切革命的、进步的作家艺术家在反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义旗帜下紧密地团结起来，同全世界一切革命的、进步的作家艺术家紧密地团结起来，为反对帝国主义、争取世界持久和平和人类进步的事业而共同奋斗。
    中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会是革命文艺工作者持续跃进的誓师大会。党和人民期望着革命文艺战士们创造出更多的好作品来为社会主义、共产主义的伟大事业服务。我们的文艺工作者必须坚持文艺为工农兵服务的方向，同现代修正主义和各种形形色色的资产阶级文艺思想进行不调和的斗争；同时大大加强马克思主义的文艺批评来促进文艺创作的健康发展。我们的文艺工作者必须认真学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，努力提高政治思想水平和艺术技巧；继续深入工农群众，参加生产劳动和实际工作，使自己真正工农化；用百倍千倍的干劲，和全国人民一道前进，创造出比过去任何时代更为伟大、更为光辉夺目的社会主义文学艺术作品！
    我国的革命文学艺术已经取得了很大的成绩，得到了党和人民的很高的评价，但是摆在文艺工作者面前的任务是艰巨的，需要我们继续付出更大的努力，我们没有丝毫理由可以自满。为了争取更大的胜利，全国文艺工作者一方面要有雄心大志，敢想敢说敢作，充分发挥创造精神；另一方面必须虚心学习，刻苦钻研，脚踏实地，埋头苦干，为更好地发展社会主义文艺，攀登革命文艺的高峰，献出全部的力量！
