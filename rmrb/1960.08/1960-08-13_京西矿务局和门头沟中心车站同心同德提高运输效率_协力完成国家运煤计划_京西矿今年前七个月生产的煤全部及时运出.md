The Jingxi Mining Bureau and Mentougou Central Station Work Together to Improve Transportation Efficiency
Jointly Complete the National Coal Transportation Plan
All Coal Produced by Jingxi Mine in the First Seven Months of This Year Was Shipped Out in a Timely Manner

(Our Report) Beijing: This year, the Jingxi Mining Bureau in Beijing has shipped out all of the coal produced in the first seven months, an increase of 1% compared to the same period last year. This is the result of the Jingxi Mining Bureau and the Mentougou Central Station of the Beijing Railway Bureau effectively improving transportation efficiency under the guidance of the spirit of communist cooperation. The Ministry of Coal Industry and the Ministry of Railways, recognizing the great achievements made by these two units in jointly completing the national coal transportation plan, have twice rewarded them, naming them as national red banner units for road-mine cooperation.

The large-scale cooperation between these two units, centered on the task of rapid coal transportation, has continuously expanded and developed in scope and content along with the continuous growth of coal production. In the early stage of establishing cooperative relations in 1958, the two units merely strengthened contact and helped each other with urgent transportation tasks. Later, as the transportation tasks became larger and larger, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, a unified road-mine cooperation transportation headquarters was established to conduct unified planning and unified dispatch based on the national coal allocation plan and the production situation of the coal mines. The Mentougou Central Station, the Beijing Railway Office, and the Beijing Railway Administration all have cadres stationed in the Jingxi Mining Bureau, and each mine under the Jingxi Mining Bureau has stations. They promptly exchange information, enabling the coal mines to understand the changes in train flow at any time, and the stations to promptly and rationally allocate vehicles according to the daily and shift output of coal mines. However, as the coal production of the Jingxi Mining Bureau became higher and higher, 157.59% of the previous year last year and 139.75% of the same period last year in the first half of this year, the contradiction between transportation capacity and transportation volume on this line emerged again. The loading points on this line are short, the coal bunkers are small, and the loading and unloading equipment is backward. The train has to be disintegrated outside the line according to the length of the loading line first, and then sent into the mine in batches. During loading, some manual handling tools such as baskets are also needed. After a series of complicated shunting processes, the train can leave the station. As a result, part of the coal produced by Jingxi Mine could not be transported out in time.

In order to quickly change this situation, the workers of the Jingxi Mining Bureau and the Mentougou Central Station have been working together since the beginning of this year to carry out a series of technical transformations on lines and coal bunkers, and to improve loading and unloading methods. Based on the principle of facilitating railway loading and unloading transportation, the engineering and technical personnel of both sides jointly formulated a line reconstruction plan. The Jingxi Mining Bureau drew manpower from its mines to carry out rush reconstruction of lines at the four loading points of Chengzi, Anjiatan, Datai, and Muchengjian. The Party General Branch Secretary and Station Master of Mentougou Central Station also led the staff and family members of their stations to come to support. They jointly extended the loading line by 320 meters, and improved the loading and unloading equipment along the line, including the reconstruction of one coal storage bin, the construction of three landslide bins, and the manufacture of 163 various indigenous loading and unloading machines, realizing the hoisting of heavy goods and the slipping of scattered goods. After the technical transformation of the loading point of Anjiatan Coal Mine, the whole coal train can directly drive to the loading point. As soon as the gate of the coal bunker is opened, the coal rushes into the carriages like a black waterfall. In a dozen minutes, twenty carriages are filled with coal. The three loading points of Chengzi, Datai, and Muchengjian, which are undergoing technical transformation, have also realized the entire train loading and unloading because the lines have been extended. People call this loading method "straight in and straight out with one hook".

The cooperative relationship between the two units has also been further strengthened. The Mentougou Central Station regards itself as the transportation department of the coal mine, and the Jingxi Coal Mine also regards the Mentougou Central Station as its own station. The coal mine workers strive to increase coal production, and the station workers launch red flag competitions to rationally allocate vehicles in every possible way, so as to ensure high output with high transportation. When there is a shortage of carriages, the railway workers contact them everywhere and organize the special vehicles of some enterprises in the Beijing area to insist on transporting the coal out in time. The coal mine workers also actively assist the station in solving problems in their work. When a large number of goods arrived at the Seshufen Station and the unloading workers were too busy, the director of the Anjiatan Coal Mine led the workers and their families to climb over the mountains to help unload the goods.

After these improvements, the transportation efficiency has been greatly improved. The average stopping time of the train from entering the station, loading, to leaving has been shortened from three hours in January to one hour and fifty-one minutes in July. The average daily coal transportation volume of each loading point has increased from 18,129 tons to 22,419 tons, meeting the current coal transportation requirements of the Jingxi Mining Bureau. The improvement of transportation efficiency has promoted the development of production on both sides. By the end of July, the Mentougou Central Station had overfulfilled the freight transportation plan for the first seven months of this year by 5.7%, and the Jingxi Mining Bureau had also overfulfilled the national coal production plan for the first seven months by 12.05%.

### 京西矿务局和门头沟中心车站同心同德提高运输效率  协力完成国家运煤计划  京西矿今年前七个月生产的煤全部及时运出

    京西矿务局和门头沟中心车站同心同德提高运输效率
    协力完成国家运煤计划
    京西矿今年前七个月生产的煤全部及时运出
    本报讯　北京市京西矿务局今年头七个月生产的煤全部及时运出去了，运出的煤炭比去年同期增长1％。这是京西矿务局和北京铁路局门头沟中心站在共产主义大协作精神的指导下，有效地提高了运输效率的结果。煤炭工业部和铁道部鉴于这两个单位在协力完成国家运煤计划方面所作出的巨大成就，已两度奖励他们，把他们评为全国路矿协作的红旗单位。
    这两个单位以快速运煤为中心任务的大协作，随着煤炭生产的不断增长，协作的范围和内容不断扩大和发展。在1958年建立协作关系的初期，两单位之间只是加强联系，遇有紧急运输任务互相帮忙。后来，运输任务越来越大，路矿双方在中共北京市委领导下，成立了统一的路矿协作运输指挥部，根据国家煤炭调运计划和煤矿的生产情况，进行统一计划，统一调度。门头沟中心站、北京铁路办事处和北京铁路管理局都有驻京西矿务局的干部，京西矿务局所属各矿都设有车站，他们及时互通情报，使煤矿能随时了解车流的变化，车站也能根据煤矿每日每班的煤炭产量及时合理地调配车辆。但是，由于京西矿务局的煤炭产量越来越高，去年为前年的157.59％，今年上半年为去年同期的139.75％，这条线路上运力和运量的矛盾又呈现出来。这条线路上的各个装车点，线路短，煤仓小，装卸设备落后，列车要先按照装车线的长度在线外解体，然后分批送入矿内，装车时，还要用一部分人力抬筐等落后的工具，经过一系列繁琐的调车过程，列车才能驶离车站。结果，京西矿生产出来的煤炭有一部分便不能及时运走。
    京西矿务局和门头沟中心站的职工为了迅速改变这种状况，今年以来，同心同德地对线路、煤仓等进行了一系列的技术改造，并改进了装卸方法。根据便利铁路装卸运输的原则，双方工程技术人员一起制订了线路改建计划。京西矿务局所属各矿抽出人力，在城子、安家滩、大台、木城涧四个装车点突击改造线路。门头沟中心站的党总支书记和站长也带领所属各站的职工和职工家属前来支援。他们共同延长了装车线路三百二十米，并在沿线改进了装卸设备，计改建储煤仓一座，修建滑坡仓三座，制造各种土洋装卸机具一百六十三件，实现了笨重货物装卸吊杆化，零散货物装卸滑溜化。安家滩煤矿的装车点经过技术改造，整列煤车可以直接驶达装车点。煤仓闸门一开，煤炭就像黑色瀑布一样，涌进车皮中去，在十几分钟时间内，二十个车皮就都装满了煤炭。正在进行技术改造的城子、大台、木城涧三个装车点，由于延长了线路，现在也都实现了整列装卸。人们把这种装车法叫做“直出直入一钩成”。
    两个单位的协作关系也进一步加强了。门头沟中心站把自己看成是煤矿的运输部，京西煤矿也把门头沟中心站当做自己的车站。煤矿职工努力增产煤炭，车站职工便展开红旗竞赛，千方百计合理调配车辆，以高运保高产。车皮缺少时，铁路职工就到处联系，把北京地区一些企业的专用车辆组织起来，坚持把煤及时运送出去。煤矿职工也积极协助车站解决工作中的问题。色树坟车站到了大批货物，卸车工人忙不过来，安家滩煤矿矿长就带领职工家属翻山越岭来帮助卸车。
    经过这些改进，运输效率有了很大的提高。列车从进站、装车到开走，平均停站时间已从1月份的三小时缩短到7月份的一小时五十一分，各装车点平均每天的运煤量由一万八千一百二十九吨上升为二万二千四百一十九吨，满足了京西矿务局目前煤炭运输的要求。运输效率的提高，对双方生产的发展都起了促进作用。到7月底，门头沟中心站超额5.7％完成了今年七个月的货运计划，京西矿务局也超额12.05％完成了七个月的国家产煤计划。（附图片）
