Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, July 31st: The Chilean Movement for Support and Defense of the Cuban Revolution held a mass rally in Santiago today, attended by 10,000 people, in support of the Cuban revolution. This rally was one of the activities of the "Week of Support and Defense of Cuba" which began on the 25th. Julio Benítez, leader of the Chilean Socialist Party and Vice Chairman of the United Workers' Confederation, and Ernesto Miranda, leader of the Chilean Leather and Shoe Workers' Union, spoke at the meeting. César Godoy, a national leader of the Chilean Communist Party, emphasized in his speech that US imperialism is now preparing to launch a willful attack on Cuba. To achieve this goal, under the instigation of American interest groups, a meeting of the Organization of American States will be held in San José, the capital of Costa Rica. He pointed out that imperialism is attempting to decide the fate of Cuba and other Latin American countries there. But the people of Latin American countries will certainly be able to crush this conspiracy.

On July 30th, the Chilean Movement for Support and Defense of the Cuban Revolution held a reception in the hall of the Chilean Journalists Association, expressing gratitude to the journalists for their cooperation in the "Week of Support and Defense of Cuba." Salvador Allende, Chairman of the Chilean People's Action Front, the Cuban Ambassador to Chile, Elías Malea, a national leader of the Chilean United Workers' Confederation, and other prominent figures attended the reception. Federico Klein, leader of the Movement for Support and Defense of the Cuban Revolution and former Chilean Ambassador to Guatemala, said at the reception: We oppose the United States' disrespect for the Cuban people's right to choose their own government and enact their own laws.

Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd: According to Latin American News Agency from La Paz: More than 8,000 Bolivian workers held a pro-Cuba demonstration and mass rally in the streets of the capital on the 1st. Despite the Minister of Labor's threat to withhold wages from workers, the workers unanimously responded to the call issued by the Bolivian Workers' Central Union Federation to hold a demonstration. Speakers at the pro-Cuba rally demanded that the Bolivian people continue to give the Cuban revolution their strongest support. José María Palacios, Executive Secretary of the Bolivian Workers' Central Union Federation, said in his speech that the most important reason why the Bolivian people support the Cuban people is that the Bolivian people themselves are also suffering from the shackles of imperialism.

The demonstration was held not far from the US Embassy. During the demonstration, American businesses were closed, and a large number of police equipped with tear gas conducted tight security around the US Embassy.

    7月30日，智利支援和保卫古巴革命运动组织在智利新闻工作者协会大厅里举行了招待会，对记者们在“支援和保卫古巴周”中提供的合作表示感谢。智利人民行动阵线主席萨尔瓦多·阿伦德、古巴驻智利大使、以及智利工人统一工会全国领导人埃利亚斯·马列亚和其他著名人士参加了招待会。支援和保卫古巴革命运动组织的领导人、前智利驻危地马拉大使费德民科·克莱因在招待会上说：我们反对美国不尊重古巴人民选择自己政府和颁布自己法律的权利的态度。
    据新华社2日讯　据拉丁美洲通讯社自拉巴斯报道：八千多玻利维亚工人1日在首都的大街上举行了支持古巴的示威游行和群众集会。尽管劳动部长以不发给工资来威胁工人，但是工人们一致响应玻利维亚工人中央工会联合会发出的关于举行示威游行的号召。在支持古巴的群众集会上，发言的人要求玻利维亚人民继续给予古巴革命以最坚决的支持。玻利维亚工人中央工会联合会执行书记何塞·玛丽亚·帕拉西奥斯在讲话中说，玻利维亚人民支持古巴人民最重要的原因是，玻利维亚人民也亲身遭受着帝国主义的羁绊。
