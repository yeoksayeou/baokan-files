Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 13th: The blowers and ventilators produced by the workers of the Shenyang Fan Factory are becoming more sophisticated and of higher quality. Since the beginning of this year, 100% of the products leaving the factory have met the quality standards stipulated by the state, with every product being of excellent quality. In the first half of this year, the factory's processing parts reject rate dropped from 0.49% in the same period last year to 0.22%, and further decreased to 0.12% in July. Currently, all forty-five types of fans produced by the factory have reached the most advanced level in the country.

The various types of blowers and ventilators produced by the Shenyang Fan Factory are supplied to key enterprises in the steel, coal, and power industries. The quality and performance of these products have a significant impact on increasing production in these industries. Therefore, the factory's Party organization has always placed the improvement of product performance and quality as a top priority in production, and has made it the main content of each period's technical innovation and technical revolution movement. In the process of improving product performance and quality, they first focused on the design stage, vigorously promoted design revolution, and improved product quality from the structural aspect. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has used the "three-way combination" method, involving factory personnel, external experts, and users, to carry out design reforms on sixty-five old products, transforming these originally low-efficiency and material-consuming products into new types of products with high efficiency, low material consumption, and light weight. For example, a blast furnace blower recently designed successfully has an air delivery rate of 1.38 times that of the original type of blower, while maintaining basically the same weight. Since the beginning of this year, the efficiency of the mine ventilators they have produced has generally increased by 10% to 20% after repeated reforms, while the material used for each fan has been greatly reduced, with some saving more than half of the material.

The employees of the Shenyang Fan Factory vigorously carried out "Multi-Treasure Coordination," combining various new technologies that can improve product performance and quality, with significant results. For example, in terms of design, they recently successfully reformed a "seven-in-one" fan through the "Multi-Treasure Coordination" movement, absorbing the advanced technologies of seven types of fans, which not only greatly improved the efficiency but also reduced material consumption and processing man-hours by half. The use of "Multi-Treasure Coordination" in the processing of cooling tower fan blades simplified the process, improved efficiency, and achieved a 100% quality rate. In addition, the advanced experience of "Multi-Treasure Coordination" was also promoted in the inspection of parts and products, effectively preventing the generation of defective products.

In order to ensure product quality, they also established practical new systems in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and developed the originally formulated nine single-item quality assurance management systems into a complete set of new inspection systems. The workshops, work sections, and production groups also combined the previously scattered experiences into a complete system, developing effective "three meetings" system: pre-shift meetings with clear handover, strict procedures, and strengthened collaboration; technical research meetings that can improve technical level and prevent the occurrence of defective products; and defective product root cause analysis meetings that can identify the causes of defective products and further strengthen measures to improve quality. The coordination of these systems has more effectively prevented the generation of defective products.

The joint efforts of leaders and the masses, strengthening the "three-way combination" of cadres, workers, and technical personnel, and strengthening the combination of mass quality management and professional quality management, are also important guarantees for the continuous improvement of product quality in this factory. From members of the Party Committee to middle-level cadres, the entire factory implemented a system of division of labor with contracted responsibilities and fixed points. They all went deep into the front line to solve specific problems in a down-to-earth manner. The management departments also ensured that "someone is in the workshop every day, and someone is grasping the key points at all times."

    把先进的设计、操作和管理制度配成套
    沈阳扇风机厂台台产品优良
    新华社沈阳13日电　沈阳扇风机厂职工生产的鼓风机和通风机越来越精巧，质量越来越高。今年以来出厂的产品百分之百达到了国家规定的质量标准，台台产品优良。今年上半年全厂加工件废品率由去年同期的0.49％降为0.22％，7月份更降低为0.12％。目前全厂生产的四十五种各种类型的风机，已经全部达到了国内最先进的水平。
    沈阳扇风机厂生产的各种类型的鼓风机和通风机，都是供应钢铁工业、煤炭工业和电站等重点企业的，产品质量好坏、性能高低，对钢铁、煤炭和发电企业的增产有很大关系，因此，这个厂党组织在生产中始终把提高产品性能和产品质量放在首要地位，并且作为每个时期技术革新和技术革命运动的主要内容。他们在提高产品性能和质量的过程中，首先抓住设计这一环节，大搞设计革命，从结构上来提高产品的质量。今年以来，全厂通过厂内外“三结合”的办法，对六十五种老产品进行设计改革，使这些原来效能低、耗料多的产品，一跃而为效率高、用料少、体重轻的新型产品。例如，不久前设计成功的一种高炉生产用的鼓风机，在重量基本相同的情况下，每分钟送风量比原来类型的鼓风机增加了一点三八倍。今年以来他们生产的煤矿用的通风机，经过一再改革，效率一般都提高10％到20％，而每台风机所用的材料却大为减少，有的节约材料一半以上。
    沈阳扇风机厂职工大搞“多宝配套”，把能提高产品性能和质量的各种新技术合而为一，效果也十分显著。例如，在设计方面，他们最近通过“多宝配套”运动，吸收七种风机的先进技术，改革成功了一种“七合一”风机，不仅效能大为提高，而且用料和加工工时都减少了一半。在加工冷却塔风机叶片方面采用“多宝配套”以后，简化了工序，提高了效率，质量达到了100％。此外，在部件和产品的检验方面也推行了“多宝配套”的先进经验，有效地防止了废品的产生。
    为了保证产品质量，他们在技术革新和技术革命运动中还建立了切实可行的新制度，并且把原来制定的九项保证质量的单项管理制度发展成一整套新的检验制度。各车间、工段和生产小组还把过去分散的经验配套成龙，发展成行之有效的“三会”制度：明确交接、严密手续、加强协作的班前会议；能提高技术水平、防止废品发生的技术研究会；能找出废品原因，进一步加强措施提高质量的废品追根会。这些制度的配套，更有效地防止了废品的产生。
    领导和群众上下齐动手，加强干部工人和技术人员“三结合”，加强群众质量管理和专业质量管理的结合，也是这个厂产品质量能够不断提高的重要保证。全厂从党委委员到中层干部，都实行了分工包干、分片定点。他们都深入第一线，扎扎实实地解决具体问题。管理科室也做到“天天有人下车间，时时有人抓关键”。
