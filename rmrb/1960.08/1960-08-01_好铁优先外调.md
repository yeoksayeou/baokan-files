    Good Iron Prioritized for External Transfer
    Jiangsu Province is promoting the spirit of "prioritizing the needs of the whole nation over local needs," adhering to the principle of prioritizing the external transfer of good iron. At the end of June, the Jiangsu Provincial Metallurgical Bureau issued a call to all "small-scale iron smelting groups" throughout the province, requiring all regions to go all out to support key converter steelmaking enterprises outside the province and ensure the completion of the third-quarter task of exporting pig iron. At present, a batch of qualified pig iron has been transferred out of the province, powerfully supporting Shanghai's steel industry.

    好铁优先外调
    江苏省发扬“先外后内”的全国一盘棋精神，坚持把好铁优先外调。6月底，江苏省冶金局就向全省炼铁“小洋群”发出号召，要求各地全力以赴，支援省外重点转炉炼钢企业，保证完成第三季度生铁外调任务。目前，全省已调出一批合格生铁，有力地支援了上海炼钢工业。
