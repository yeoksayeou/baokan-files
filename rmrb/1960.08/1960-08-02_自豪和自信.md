    Pride and Confidence	Xia Yang
    At the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, Comrade Lu Dingyi, in his congratulatory message on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and Comrade Zhou Yang, in his report, gave full estimation and affirmative evaluation of the achievements of our literary and art work. This is entirely correct and absolutely necessary. This is a matter of enhancing the ambition of the proletariat and diminishing the prestige of the bourgeoisie; it is a matter of enhancing the ambition of socialism and diminishing the prestige of imperialism.
    Achievements are, in themselves, objectively existing things; affirming achievements is, in itself, a matter of being practical and realistic and easy to conclude. However, looking back, affirming objectively existing achievements also involves struggle. The bourgeoisie, imperialism, and their lackeys, the modern revisionists, never acknowledge our achievements and constantly engage in all kinds of slander and vilification against us. When we evaluate our own achievements, they call us "propaganda" and "bragging." This is not surprising at all. A dog's mouth cannot produce ivory; how can we expect them to affirm our achievements? The powerful People's Republic of China stands tall in the world; isn't American imperialism blind and talking nonsense by still refusing to recognize us?
    We want to say to these gentlemen: Our literature and art are loved by 650 million workers, peasants, and soldiers, and encouraged by people around the world who are fighting for independence and freedom. This is our supreme glory. As for whether you acknowledge or praise us, we do not care at all. We will never be alarmed or anxious about your slander and vilification of our achievements. On the contrary, we should consider it a good thing. Didn't Lenin say something like this a long time ago?
    "The Bolsheviks, the internationalists, the supporters of the proletarian revolution, ought to 'hear' words of praise in this rude, mad roar, because the furious hatred of the bourgeoisie is often the best proof of the correct and faithful service of those who are slandered, persecuted, and victimized to the proletariat." (See "Lenin's Collected Works" Vol. 25, pp. 248-249)
    Lenin also said: "The Bolsheviks can quite justly apply to themselves the words of a famous poet." He repeatedly quoted a few lines of Nekrasov's poem:
      The sounds of approval he hears,
      Are not in the dulcet tones of praise,
      But in outbursts of hatred and rage.
    From this, we can see that we cannot separate ourselves from the viewpoint of class analysis when looking at any issue. In this way, we will be able to make a full and affirmative evaluation of the achievements of our literature and art, and we will take the recognition and praise of the proletariat and the masses as the standard of measurement and be proud of it.
    Some people say: "You are arrogant and complacent!" Arrogant? Yes, we are proud of the great victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. The east wind is strong, and the west wind is weak. Why shouldn't we be proud? However, we have never been complacent. Our Party and our leaders always teach us not to be complacent and constantly present us with new tasks. It is not enough to just not be complacent; we must also be modest and prudent, careful, down-to-earth, and work hard, strengthen our study of Marxism-Leninism, and further diligently study our profession to write more and better works. In fact, our literary and artistic work is still far from meeting the requirements of the masses, and we still need to make more arduous and long-term efforts.
    We must never be self-deprecating, and we must fully affirm our achievements; while fully affirming our achievements, we must never be complacent. What we need and already possess is confidence, proletarian confidence, Mao Zedong-style confidence.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, starting from fighting with bare hands, overthrew the three major enemies and seized power. The Chinese people, who have stood up, are using their rich experience in struggle, including the experience of literary and artistic struggle, to engage in the great cause of socialist construction. This includes literary and artistic undertakings. The development of the entire socialist cause is a good and solid foundation for our literature and art to achieve success. We have a complete set of Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic theories developed by Comrade Mao Zedong as a guide. The Party has pointed out the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers; under the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, the path of letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend, and bringing forth the new through the old, as well as the creative method of combining revolutionary realism with revolutionary romanticism. How superior are our existing conditions! We will inevitably be able to push socialist literature and art to the peak of the world.
    Now, Comrade Lu Dingyi, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, has put forward glorious and arduous tasks for us. He wants us to "use the weapon of literature and art to greatly improve the socialist and communist ideological consciousness of the people of the whole country and improve the communist moral character of the people of the whole country." He wants us to "carry out a long-term and unremitting struggle against bourgeois ideology." He wants us to "thoroughly expose and smash the conspiracies of imperialists and modern revisionists. In this important and arduous struggle," to "contribute our own strength." He wants us to "struggle for the establishment of a broad united front against the imperialist camp headed by American imperialism." On the bright road opened up for us by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, we are full of confidence and will always be firm and thorough revolutionaries, using the weapon of literature and art to accomplish this historic task.

    自豪和自信	夏阳
    在全国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会上，陆定一同志代表党中央和国务院的祝词和周扬同志的报告中，对我国的文学艺术工作的成绩作了充分的估计和肯定的评价。这是完全正确的，也是十分必要的。这是长无产阶级志气，灭资产阶级威风的问题，这是长社会主义志气，灭帝国主义威风的问题。
    成绩，这本是客观存在的东西；肯定成绩，这本是实事求是易于做出结论的事情。但是，回顾既往，要肯定客观存在的成绩，也是有斗争的。资产阶级、帝国主义以及他们的走卒现代修正主义分子总是不承认我们的成绩，对我们进行种种的诽谤和污蔑。当我们估价自己的成绩的时候，称我们为“宣传”、“吹嘘”。这是丝毫也不足奇怪的。狗嘴里吐不出象牙，我们怎么能设想他们会来肯定我们的成绩呢？强大的中华人民共和国屹立在世界之上，美帝国主义不是瞎了眼睛说昏话，到现在还不承认我们吗？
    我们要对这些先生们说：我们的文学艺术受到六亿五千万工农群众的喜爱，受到世界上为独立、自由而斗争着的人们的鼓励，这是我们无尚的光荣。至于你们承认不承认，赞美不赞美，我们绝不希罕。你们对我们的成绩诽谤、污蔑，我们也绝不惊慌着急。恰恰相反，我们倒应该认为这是好事。列宁不是早就说过这样的话吗？
    “布尔什维克、国际主义者、无产阶级革命的拥护者理应在这种粗暴疯狂的叫嚣中‘听到’赞许的声音，因为资产阶级的疯狂的仇恨，往往是被诽谤、被陷害、被迫害的人正确而忠诚地为无产阶级服务的最好证明。”（见“列宁全集”25卷248—249页）
    列宁还说：“布尔什维克完全可以拿一位诗人的名言来比自己。”他反复引用过涅克拉索夫的几句诗：
      他听到的赞许声音，
      不是在娓娓动听的赞词里，
      而是在粗暴疯狂的叫嚣中。
    由此可知，我们看待任何问题，都是离不开阶级分析的观点的。这样，我们才会对自己的文学艺术的成就作出充分的肯定的评价，才会把无产阶级、人民群众的承认和赞美作为衡量的标准并以此为荣。
    有的人说：“你们骄傲自满！”骄傲吗？是的，我们对毛泽东文艺思想的伟大胜利是引以自豪的。东风劲吹，西风冷落，我们为什么不自豪呢？但是，我们从来没有自满过。我们的党，我们的领袖总是教导我们不要自满，经常给我们提出新的任务。仅仅不自满还是不够的，我们还要谦虚谨慎，小心翼翼，踏踏实实，埋头苦干，加强对马克思列宁主义的学习，更进一步刻苦钻研业务，写出更多更好的作品来。事实上我们的文学艺术工作也还远远不能满足人民群众的要求，还需要我们作更艰苦、更长期的努力。
    我们绝不自卑，必须充分肯定成绩；在充分肯定成绩的同时，我们又绝不自满。我们需要而且已经具备的是自信，无产阶级的自信，毛泽东式的自信。
    中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，从赤手空拳斗争起，打倒了三大敌人，取得了政权。站起来了的中国人民，运用丰富的斗争经验，其中也包括文艺斗争的经验，正在从事伟大的社会主义建设事业。其中包括文艺事业。整个社会主义事业的发展，是我们文学艺术取得成就的良好的坚实的基础。我们有整套的被毛泽东同志发展了的马克思列宁主义的文艺理论为指导，党给我们指明了为工农兵服务的方向；在为工农兵服务的方向下，百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新的道路，以及革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法。我们现有的条件是多么优越！我们必然能够把社会主义文学艺术推向世界的高峰。
    现在，陆定一同志代表党中央和国务院向我们提出了光荣而艰巨的任务。要我们“用文艺的武器，极大地提高全国人民社会主义和共产主义的思想觉悟，提高全国人民共产主义的道德品质。”要我们“同资产阶级思想进行长期的坚持不懈的斗争。”要我们“彻底揭穿和粉碎帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的阴谋诡计。在这一场重要的艰巨的斗争中”，“贡献出自己的力量”。要我们“为建立反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营的广泛的统一战线而奋斗”。在党和毛泽东同志为我们开辟的光明大道上，我们充满了自信，永远做坚定的、彻底的革命派，运用文学艺术的武器来完成这个历史性的任务。
