Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 13th: Responding to the call of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, industrial enterprise workers in Tianjin have launched a vigorous mass movement since mid-July to learn from, catch up with, and surpass advanced indicators, striving for "five firsts." This movement has propelled the excellent situation of a comprehensive leap forward in industrial production to a new climax and has further promoted the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

The mass movement to learn, catch up with, surpass advanced indicators, and strive for five firsts—first in output, first in quality, first in new products, first in reducing consumption, and first in safety and hygiene—is a comprehensive mass movement to create new records. It is also an effective measure to better and more comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the state plans for the third quarter and the whole year. This movement reflects the needs of the current leap-forward production situation and is in line with the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers to strive for progress. Therefore, after the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the call to strive for "five firsts," it immediately turned into practical action by the broad masses of workers. Factories, workshops, and teams throughout the city, down to individual workers, have formulated specific plans to learn from, catch up with, surpass advanced indicators, and strive for five firsts at all levels, creating a lively situation of "every factory finding a target, every person finding a competitor." Significant results have been achieved in a very short period of time. The "Flying Pigeon" bicycle produced by the Tianjin Bicycle Factory has always been known for its good quality and high output. However, several indicators, such as electroplating, paint gloss, and freewheel, were not as good as the "Forever" brand from Shanghai. At the same time, the "Flying Pigeon" used more materials, and the cost of some parts was relatively high. After the factory launched a competition to strive for the first place in the country, after less than a month of hard work, the paint gloss and electroplating gloss indicators, which were originally lower than Shanghai's "Forever" brand, exceeded the national standards, and the cost of mass-produced bicycles was reduced to the lowest level in the country.

In the movement to learn, catch up with, and surpass advanced indicators, many products that have already reached the first-class level in the country are also determined to learn from fraternal factories and climb to new heights. The Xintai Dyeing and Finishing Factory's corduroy used to be the best in the country in terms of quality. However, compared with four other domestic factories now, these factories have surpassed Xintai Factory. This news shocked the entire factory. They collected the corduroy produced by their factory in the past three years, along with the products produced by fraternal factories, a total of sixty-two product samples, and held a product quality exhibition, mobilizing workers to find the reasons and propose measures. The entire factory, from teams to individual workers, formulated measures to strive to catch up with the first-class products in the country by September. Now, the color vividness, one of the four major quality indicators of corduroy, has reached the advanced national level, and the other three indicators have also improved compared to July.

In this movement, the broad masses of workers have both the lofty aspirations to strive for first place and detailed and practical measures. At the beginning of the movement, the Tianjin Knitwear Factory widely collected the indicators, data, and samples from fraternal factories in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin, along with the factory's own indicators, and handed them over to the masses for item-by-item analysis and comparison. As a result, it was found that although some indicators of the factory had reached the advanced national or municipal levels, some indicators were relatively backward, such as the output per shift of velvet loops, which was lower than that of the Tianjin Plain Knitwear Factory. The whiteness and shrinkage rate of the sweat cloth used for making undershirts were also lower than those of Shanghai products. The thickness of the velvet loop, which was originally ranked first in the country, was also surpassed by Beijing. After analysis and comparison, specific targets and goals for "learning, catching up, surpassing, and creating" were identified, and thousands of workers throughout the factory immediately launched a vigorous production competition. Workers in the tailoring workshop launched a "three-level jump competition," that is, the first jump to break through the key, the second jump to catch up with the advanced, and the third jump to win the first place, making new records of high output and high quality constantly emerge. The cutting workshop launched the "three clevernesses" competition of clever marking, clever cutting, and clever accounting, achieving the lowest level of raw material consumption in the entire industry, winning first place. Now, the quality of vests, round-neck short-sleeved shirts, underwear, sportswear, and other products produced by the knitwear factory have reached the most advanced levels. The velvet loop thickness indicator, which was originally surpassed by Beijing, has once again taken the first place.

The movement to learn, catch up with, surpass advanced indicators, and strive for five firsts is also a good new way to apply technical innovation achievements to production. Judging from the recent development of the movement, the breakthrough of an advanced indicator or the emergence of a new record is inseparable from the workers' enthusiasm and the in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. In formulating plans to strive for five firsts, all factories have generally and necessarily linked them to the reform of equipment and technology and the solution of key production problems. Therefore, the movement to learn, catch up with, surpass advanced indicators, and the technical innovation and technical revolution movement promote each other and complement each other. In order to learn, catch up with, surpass advanced indicators, and strive for five firsts, the machinery and electronics industries in Hedong District and Hebei District have launched a new upsurge of "multi-treasure (new technology and new process) matching" for machine tool cutting. More than 140 machine tools in seven factories in Hedong District have achieved "eight treasures in one," generally increasing efficiency by more than 40%.

    既有力争第一的志气　又有细致踏实的措施
    天津开展学赶超创先进指标运动
    许多企业实现全面跃进　技术革命运动更加深入
    据新华社天津13日电　天津市工业企业职工响应中共天津市委的号召，从7月中旬起开展了轰轰烈烈的学、赶、超、创先进指标，力争“五个第一”的群众运动。这一运动把工业生产全面跃进的大好形势推向了一个新的高潮，同时也进一步促进了技术革新、技术革命运动的发展。
    学赶超创先进指标，力争产量、质量、新产品、降低消耗和安全卫生五个第一的群众运动，是一个全面创造新纪录的群众运动，也是更好地全面完成和超额完成第三季度和全年国家计划的一项有效措施。这个运动既反映了当前生产跃进形势的需要，又符合广大职工力争上游的革命积极性。因此，中共天津市委发出力争“五个第一”的号召以后，立即变成了广大职工的实际行动。全市各工厂、车间、小组一直到工人，层层制订学赶超创先进指标和力争五个第一的具体规划，出现了“厂厂找对象，人人找对手”的热烈局面，在很短的时间内就已取得了显著效果。天津自行车厂生产的“飞鸽”自行车，过去一向质量好、产量高。但是电镀、烤漆光泽度、飞轮等几个指标不如上海的“永久牌”；同时，“飞鸽”的用料比较多，有些部件的成本比较高。全厂掀起了力争全国第一的竞赛以后，经过不到一个月的埋头苦干，原来低于上海“永久牌”的烤漆电镀光泽度等指标，就都超过了国家规定的标准，大量生产的自行车成本也降到了全国最低的水平。
    在学赶超创先进指标运动中，许多产品已经达到全国第一流的工厂，也决心向兄弟厂学习，再攀高峰。信泰染整厂生产的灯心绒，过去质量是全国第一，可是现在和国内四家工厂比较，这些工厂都超过了信泰厂。这个消息震动了全厂，他们把本厂最近三年来生产的灯心绒连同兄弟厂生产的共六十二个产品样品搜集在一起，举办了一个产品质量展览会，发动职工找原因，提措施。全厂从小组到每个工人，都制订了力争在9月份赶上全国第一流产品的措施。现在，灯心绒四大质量指标之一的色泽鲜艳度已达到全国先进水平，其它三项指标，也比7月份有所提高。
    在这次运动中，广大职工既有力争第一的雄心壮志，又有细致踏实的措施。天津市针织厂在运动开始的时候，广泛搜集了上海、北京和本市各兄弟厂的指标、资料和样品，连同本厂的各项指标一起交给群众逐项进行分析对比。结果发现本厂虽然有些指标已经达到全国或全市先进水平，但还有些指标比较落后，如甬子绒台时产量低于天津市平原针织厂，做汗衫的汗布漂白度和缩水率还低于上海的产品，原来居全国第一位的甬子绒毛厚度指标也被北京超过了。经过分析对比，找出了“学赶超创”的具体对象和目标，全厂几千名职工立即展开了热火朝天的生产竞赛。裁缝车间工人开展了“三级跳竞赛”，即一跳破关键，二跳赶上先进，三跳夺上第一，使得高产优质的新纪录不断涌现。下料车间开展巧划、巧裁和巧核算的“三巧”竞赛，原材料达到了全行业消耗最低的水平，夺得了第一。现在针织厂生产的背心、圆领半袖衫、内衣、运动衣等产品的质量都达到了最先进的水平。原来被北京超过的甬子绒毛厚度指标，又再次跃居第一。
    学赶超创先进指标、力争五个第一的运动也是把技术革新成果运用到生产上去的一个很好的新形式。从最近一个时期运动发展情况来看，一项先进指标的突破或新纪录的出现，都是和职工们的干劲和深入开展技术革新、技术革命运动分不开的。各厂在制定力争五个第一的规划中，都普遍地也是必然地联系到设备、工艺的改革和解决生产关键等。因而学赶超创先进指标运动和技术革新、技术革命运动互相促进，相辅相成。河东区和河北区的机电行业为了学赶超创先进指标，力争五个第一，掀起了机床切削“多宝（新技术新工艺）配套”的新高潮。河东区七个工厂有一百四十多台机床作到了“八宝合一”，一般都提高效率40％以上。
