    Jiangsu and Shanxi Plant and Manage Autumn Vegetables Simultaneously
    A mass movement to plant autumn vegetables and manage them well is underway in both urban and rural areas of Jiangsu Province. To date, rural canteens alone have planted over 1.7 million mu of melons and vegetables throughout the province. During the concentrated rush to plant melons and vegetables, various localities, adhering to the spirit of "Plant one mu, manage it well, plant and manage simultaneously, manage to the end," have organized specialized teams to strengthen management.
    In Shanxi, the early-sown autumn vegetables have mostly sprouted, and, due to ample rainfall after planting, are generally growing well. Currently, various localities are seizing the opportunity after the rain to carry out thinning, weeding, fertilizing, watering, and pest and disease control for autumn vegetables.

    Gansu Launches Summer Manure Collection High Tide
    Gansu Province has launched a high tide of summer manure collection by combining temporary concentrated efforts with long-term construction. Since the beginning of summer, the four special districts and autonomous prefecture of Tianshui, Pingliang, Dingxi, and Linxia have accumulated organic fertilizer and created soil fertilizer sufficient to apply mid-season topdressing to more than half of the autumn fields, with high-yield fields and third-class fields receiving more than two topdressings.

    Hexi Corridor Fully Launches Summer Harvest
    The intense battle of the summer harvest has fully begun in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province. By July 19, the entire region had harvested more than 570,000 mu of various summer crops.

    The wheat fields in Zhangye Special District (i.e., the Hexi Corridor) have expanded by more than 340,000 mu compared to last year. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the entire region have persevered in the fight against drought, and the summer crops are generally growing well. Currently, the early-sown winter wheat and summer coarse grains have all matured and are fully being harvested; spring wheat is also gradually turning from green to yellow and will soon begin to be harvested.

    Zhejiang Attacks Cotton Boll Retention Again
    After more than two months of labor, the broad masses of commune members in the cotton-growing areas of Zhejiang Province have victoriously launched the first salvo in the struggle to achieve "boll-laden plants," resulting in a large number of cotton plants bearing bolls before the hottest days of summer, a phenomenon unseen in previous years. Throughout the province, more than 80% of the cotton fields have plants bearing bolls before the hottest days of summer, with each cotton plant generally bearing three to four bolls.

    One of the major keys to boll retention is to eliminate insect pests and reduce boll shedding. Following the vigorous prevention and control of the first generation of pink bollworms in the previous stage, the masses in various cotton-growing areas have recently redoubled their efforts to prevent and control the second generation of pink bollworms.

    Greater Khingan Range Forest Area Continues to Reclaim Land and Increase Planting
    The Greater Khingan Range Forest Area in Inner Mongolia has launched a land reclamation movement for intercropping grain and forests, having cultivated and planted over 83,000 mu of open land in the forests, an increase of two and a half times compared to last year. Currently, thousands of workers and commune members from people's communes in various parts of the forest area are still mobilizing every day to continue reclaiming open land in the forests and near residential areas, planting autumn vegetables such as cabbage, radishes, and scallions.

    Lüda Successfully Experiments with Planting Vegetables Once, Harvesting Multiple Times
    The Lüda Agricultural Science Research Institute, Dalian Normal College, and the Lüda Yingchengzi People's Commune have jointly experimented with the successful practice of planting vegetables once and harvesting multiple times. In order to improve vegetable cultivation methods and utilize the regenerative ability of plants, they have enabled the remaining roots and stems after harvesting to continue to grow and be harvested again, under conditions of ample manure and water. Currently, successful experiments include kohlrabi, celery, garland chrysanthemum, fennel, and bok choy.
