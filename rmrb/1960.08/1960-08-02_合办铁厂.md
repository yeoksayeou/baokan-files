    Jointly Run Ironworks
    The Shaanxi Provincial Textile Industry Bureau and the Qianxian People's Committee jointly run the Zhaozhen Iron Smelting Plant. Because both sides proceed from the overall interest and fully demonstrate the spirit of communist cooperation, they compete to take on difficulties in the construction of the plant, and let the other party use iron first, so that the difficulties and problems encountered in the construction and production of the iron plant are quickly resolved. At present, they have not only largely solved their respective urgent needs for pig iron in production and construction, but also can supply a certain amount of pig iron to the entire province.

    合办铁厂
    陕西省纺织工业局和乾县人民委员会合办赵镇炼铁厂。由于双方从整体利益出发，充分发挥共产主义协作精神，在建厂中争困难，在用铁时让对方，使铁厂建设和生产中遇到的困难问题迅速得到解决。目前，他们不仅在很大程度上解决了各自在生产和建设中对生铁的迫切需要，而且还能供给全省一定数量的生铁。
