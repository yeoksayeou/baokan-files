Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Actively Treats Chronic Diseases
Shanghai Hypertension Research Institute Initially Finds Ways to Control Hypertension
Harbin Medical University Carries Out Comprehensive Treatment Activities and Achieves Results

    This newspaper reports that the Shanghai Hypertension Research Institute has adopted a comprehensive treatment method combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine to treat hypertension, and has initially found ways to control hypertension. At the same time, important clues have also been obtained in the research on the theory of hypertension pathogenesis and classification methods.
    This comprehensive treatment method uses Chinese and Western medicines to lower blood pressure, compound Chinese medicines and qigong to correct the body's imbalance, and qigong and tai chi to consolidate the curative effect. This set of comprehensive treatment methods not only has significant short-term effects, but also very high long-term effects. Last year, the Hypertension Research Institute summarized the efficacy of 100 stubborn cases, with a total effective rate of 93%, of which 75 cases had been ineffective with various single therapies, and some had even suffered from hemiplegia.
    The Research Institute implements the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical, and facilitating patients, and is constantly developing new applications of comprehensive treatment methods. When they promoted comprehensive treatment methods for outpatients in 52 large and small factories, statistics from 923 cases showed that except for 10% of stubborn cases who used drugs to help lower blood pressure, the remaining cases did not use drugs, but only adopted qigong therapy, and the effect was also very good, and the efficacy of many patients can be consolidated for a long time. Wang Banggui, a worker in a cotton spinning factory, had very high blood pressure, heart palpitations, dizziness, back pain, and obesity. In the winter of 1959, he used qigong treatment alone. After a week, he felt his symptoms were reduced and he was in good spirits, and his blood pressure also began to drop. In March of this year, all symptoms disappeared, his health recovered, and he returned to work. He has persisted in practicing qigong every day since then, and his blood pressure has always remained normal.
    The integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine therapy is the result of close cooperation between doctors of traditional Chinese and Western medicine under the leadership of the Party. When the Hypertension Research Institute was established, the Party organized medical staff to repeatedly study the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, which improved the policy and ideological understanding of the medical staff. At the same time, the Party clearly pointed out the research direction of combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine to study hypertension, and adopted effective organizational measures. However, due to the lack of experience in how to combine traditional Chinese and Western medicine, some detours were taken in the research work: Some people were only enthusiastic about the research on the blood pressure-lowering effect of single Chinese medicines, fearing that the simultaneous use of several drugs and therapies and the simultaneous use of traditional Chinese and Western medical therapies would be difficult to distinguish the efficacy and difficult to summarize, but the blood pressure of some seriously ill stubborn cases always rebounded after it was lowered by the use of a single therapy, and a relatively satisfactory conclusion could not be drawn on the efficacy. At that time, the researchers were quite depressed. The Party proposed to them: to proceed from the goal of restoring patients' health as soon as possible, to comprehensively absorb the rich experience of traditional Chinese medicine, and to conduct research on the basis of clinical effectiveness; to prevent the bourgeois medical scientific viewpoint of researching for the sake of research and the tendency to simply pursue the efficacy of one prescription and one agent. At the same time, in order to enable researchers to better study traditional Chinese medicine, Party leaders invited famous veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors in Shanghai to form a guidance group to guide the research institute's personnel to conduct theoretical discussions. Under the Party's continuous patient education, enlightenment and specific assistance, everyone realized that studying the effect of only one prescription or one therapy can only superficially understand traditional Chinese medicine, and is far from keeping up with the needs of prevention and treatment, so they worked hard to study the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, and at the same time humbly learned from traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in clinical practice: learning to practice qigong, learning traditional Chinese medicine practitioners' pulse taking, observing tongue coating, prescribing and other diagnostic and treatment methods, diagnosing and treating together with traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and listening to traditional Chinese medicine practitioners' analysis of the condition, thereby continuously deepening their understanding of traditional Chinese medicine. Everyone felt that although there is no name for hypertension in traditional Chinese medicine, there is a wealth of treatment experience for the same symptoms as hypertension. Therefore, research confidence was strengthened. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have also improved their treatment level in the process of studying and cooperating with Western medicine practitioners. In this way, the doctors of traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the Research Institute were closely united, and a large number of effective therapies such as Chinese and Western medicines, acupuncture, and qigong were adopted. As a result, on the basis of clinical efficacy, a comprehensive traditional Chinese and Western medicine therapy that uses Chinese and Western medicines to lower blood pressure, compound Chinese medicines and qigong to correct the body's imbalance, and qigong, tai chi and other methods to consolidate the curative effect was gradually summarized.
    The comprehensive traditional Chinese and Western medicine therapy for hypertension is the product of a communist collaboration launched by the Shanghai medical and scientific communities under the leadership of the Party. A total of 90 doctors of traditional Chinese and Western medicine and relevant medical scientific researchers from 34 collaborative units in the city participated in the research. The research work also implemented the mass line. They relied on grassroots medical units to carry out general survey and prevention and control work. Two blood pressure surveys were conducted last year and this year, basically clarifying the prevalence of hypertension in Shanghai.

    This newspaper reports that the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University has carried out a "rapid comprehensive treatment" activity and achieved preliminary results.
    Since May of this year, the hospital has treated 91 hypertension patients in four batches using the "rapid comprehensive treatment" method. After two weeks of treatment for the first batch of 20 patients, the blood pressure of these patients returned to normal. Zhao Chongwu, a 58-year-old man who had been suffering from hypertension for more than 20 years and also had hemiplegia, had undergone long-term treatment and recuperation with other methods before this treatment, but was ineffective. This time, after 14 days of treatment in the hospital, Zhao Chongwu's blood pressure quickly returned to normal, and symptoms such as hemiplegia also quickly disappeared. He has been discharged from the hospital for more than a month and his blood pressure has been stable.
    On the basis of treating the first batch of patients, the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University has treated 71 hypertension patients in the second, third, and fourth batches. The course of treatment was shortened from 14 days to 8 days. The blood pressure of all 71 patients returned to normal, and the symptoms basically disappeared. At the same time, the neurology department of the hospital also adopted "rapid comprehensive treatment" for neurasthenia, and has treated 10 batches with a total of 519 patients so far. The vast majority of patients have been relieved of their suffering and achieved certain curative effects.
    The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University adheres to putting politics in command in the implementation of rapid comprehensive treatment for chronic diseases, breaks the bourgeois medical view that chronic diseases must be treated slowly, and establishes a paradigm that chronic diseases can be cured early. The characteristic of this hospital in carrying out the "fast treatment of chronic diseases" activity is to start with ideological education, first enabling patients to establish revolutionary optimism, have the confidence and determination to overcome the disease, and then cooperate with drug treatment and other therapies.
    Now, the hospital is actively preparing to carry out the "rapid comprehensive treatment" method for chronic arthritis, chronic gastric ulcer, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic appendicitis and other diseases, in order to create experience for the rapid treatment of large numbers of chronic patients in batches.

    中西医合作积极医治慢性病
    上海高血压研究所初步找到控制高血压途径
    哈尔滨医科大学开展综合治疗活动获得成效
    本报讯　上海市高血压研究所采用中西医结合的综合疗法治疗高血压病，为控制高血压初步找到了途径，同时，在高血压病发病理论和分类方法方面的研究，也得到了重要的线索。
    这种综合疗法，就是以中西药物降压、以复方中药、气功纠正机体不平衡，以气功、太极拳等巩固疗效。这套综合疗法不但近期疗效显著，远期疗效也很高。高血压研究所在去年曾总结了一百例顽固病例的疗效，总的有效率为93％，其中有七十五例是曾用各种单纯疗法无效的，有的曾发生过偏瘫。
    研究所贯彻多快好省、便利病人的精神，对综合疗法的应用不断有新的发展。他们在五十二个大小工厂对门诊病人推行综合疗法时，从九百二十三例的统计中，其中除10％的顽固病例用药物帮助降压外，其余病例都没有用药，只采用了气功疗法，疗效也很好，而且许多病人的疗效也能够长期巩固。某棉纺纱厂工人王邦贵，血压很高，心跳、头晕、腰疼、发胖，1959年冬单采用气功治疗，一周后就觉症状减轻、精神愉快，血压也开始下降，今年3月各种症状都消失，健康恢复，重返工作岗位，直到现在每天坚持练功，血压始终保持正常。
    中西医综合疗法，是在党的领导下，中西医密切合作研究的成果。高血压研究所成立时，党就组织医务人员反复学习了党的中医政策，提高了医务人员的政策思想认识，同时，党明确地指出了中西医结合研究高血压的研究方向，并采取了有力的组织措施。但是由于大家对中西医如何结合缺乏经验，因此在研究工作上走了些弯路：有些人只热衷于中医单味药降压作用的研究，害怕同时用几种药物和疗法以及中西医疗法同时并用疗效难辨，不好总结，但是采用单种疗法，部分病情严重的顽固病例血压总是降后复升，对疗效得不到比较满意的结论。当时，研究人员相当苦闷。党向他们提出：要从尽快恢复病人健康出发，全面地吸取祖国医学丰富的经验，在临床有效的基础上进行研究；防止为研究而研究的资产阶级医学科学观点和单纯追求一方一剂疗效的倾向。同时，党的领导同志为了使研究人员能更好地学习祖国医学，邀请上海市有名的老中医师，成立了指导小组，指导研究所人员进行理论的探讨。在党不断耐心的教育、启发和具体帮助下，大家认识到光是研究一方一剂或一种疗法的效果，只能皮毛地了解祖国医学，而且远远赶不上防治的需要，于是发奋地钻研中医理论，同时虚心地从临床实践中向中医师学习：学习练气功，学习中医师按脉，观察舌苔、处方等诊断治疗方法，同中医师一道诊断和治疗，听取中医师对病情的分析，从而不断加深对祖国医学的理解。大家感到，在祖国医学中，虽无高血压病名称，但对与高血压病相同的症状，有丰富的治疗经验。因而加强了研究信心。中医师在同西医师一道学习、合作研究的过程中，治疗水平也有所提高。就这样，研究所的中西医师紧密团结，大量地采用了中西药物、针灸、气功等多种有效疗法，于是，在临床取得疗效的基础上，逐步总结出以中西药物降压，以复方中药、气功纠正机体平衡失调；以气功、太极拳等方法巩固疗效的中西医结合的综合疗法。
    高血压病中西医综合疗法，是上海医务、科学界在党的领导下，展开共产主义大协作的产物。全市三十四个协作单位中，共有九十个中、西医师及有关医学科学研究工作者参加研究。研究工作还贯彻了群众路线，他们依靠基层医疗单位开展了普查及防治工作。去年和今年进行了两次血压普查，基本上摸清了上海市的高血压患病率。
    本报讯　哈尔滨医科大学附属第一医院，开展“快速综合治疗”活动，获得了初步效果。
    这个医院从今年5月以来，就以“快速综合治疗”方法，给九十一名高血压患者，分四批进行了治疗。第一批二十名患者，经过两周治疗后，这些患者的血压恢复正常。一名患高血压有二十多年，又兼患半身麻木的五十八岁老人赵崇武，在这次治疗以前，曾经过其他的方法进行过长期治疗、休养均无效，这次赵崇武在这个医院经过十四天的治疗后，血压就迅速的恢复了正常，半身麻木等症也迅速消失，现已经出院工作月余，血压一直稳定。
    哈尔滨医大附属第一医院在治疗第一批患者的基础上，又对第二批、第三批、第四批七十一名高血压患者进行了治疗。疗程由十四天缩短到八天。七十一名患者，血压全部降为正常，病症基本消失。与此同时，这个医院神经科，对神经衰弱症，也采用了“快速综合治疗”，到目前已治疗了十批，共五百一十九名患者，绝大多数患者，都解除了痛苦，获得了一定的疗效。
    哈尔滨医大附属第一医院在对慢性病施行快速综合疗法中坚持政治挂帅，打破了慢性病必须慢治的资产阶级医学观点，树立了慢性病完全可以早愈的范例。这个医院在开展“慢病快治”活动中，其特点是先从思想教育入手，首先使患者建立起革命的乐观主义，有战胜疾病的信心和决心，再配合药物治疗，和其他一些疗法。
    现在，这个医院正积极准备开展对慢性关节炎、慢性胃溃疡、慢性盆腔炎、慢性阑尾炎等疾病进行“快速综合治疗”方法。为成批的快速治疗大量慢性病人，创造出经验。（附图片）
