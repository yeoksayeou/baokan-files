The Power of the People's Commune
——An Account of Zhangshi Commune in Guangdong Province Eliminating Traces of Disaster Mo Fupu, Zhang Jinqing

	During the summer harvest season, we arrived at Zhangshi People's Commune in the suburbs of Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province. On both sides of the road, reclaimed wasteland was covered with lush sweet potato seedlings; newly planted oil-tea trees sprouted fresh leaves; on the sunny slopes, "Dongfanghong" tractors were turning over rows of furrows. Rounding a mountain bend, a different kind of scenery unfolded: here, young men were swinging sickles to harvest the golden rice fields; there, female commune members were singing folk songs while transplanting rice seedlings. Facing us, an even more beautiful picture came into view: two newly built villages for commune members. Looking at these thriving scenes, who could imagine that just over two months ago, this commune had suffered from a once-in-a-century flood!

		Transforming Disaster into Strength

	On the evening of May 13th, the sky above Zhangshi Commune suddenly filled with thunder and lightning, and a torrential downpour began. For a time, mountains crumbled, trees fell, and waves roared wildly. At 2:00 AM on the 14th, the flood crest, carrying large amounts of sand and gravel, surged downstream, quickly overflowing the dikes and violently assaulting fields and villages. Over 20,000 mu of rice fields in seven brigades along the river were flooded, over a thousand houses collapsed one after another, most of the commune-run factories were smashed to pieces, and countless clothes and various supplies were swept away by the raging torrent. In just a few hours, this one of the earliest established people's communes in Guangdong Province was devastated beyond recognition.

	After the flood receded, large stretches of verdant rice seedlings were buried under sand and silt; roads and bridges were completely destroyed, making it difficult to travel by car or even on foot; the power plant could not generate electricity, and the broadcast speakers were silent. Some commune members couldn't help but sigh, saying, "Zhangshi is no longer like Zhangshi."

	At this time, people's mood was heavy. How long would it take to recover? People were concerned about this question. In the Tan Chang Xiaodui (team) of the Comprehensive Farm, which was severely affected, although no commune members were injured or killed, most of the houses had collapsed, and clothes, pots, pans, and farm tools had been washed away. Wu Xue Shuang, the Xiaodui leader, barely managed to retrieve an iron pot from the mud and water, temporarily cooking meals under a tree, and then tearfully inspected the surviving dilapidated houses of the commune members. At this moment, Li Haitao, the First Secretary of the Shaoguan Municipal Party Committee, arrived, as did Yang Yongmin, the secretary of the commune's Party committee, who was originally scheduled to be hospitalized for recuperation. The two secretaries expressed their condolences to Wu Xue Shuang and promised to help them solve the difficulties in production and life. At the same time, they pointed out that now that they had the People's Commune to rely on, even the greatest difficulties could be overcome. The Party's heartfelt concern greatly boosted the commune members' confidence in restoring production and rebuilding their homes.

		Restoring Production

	Within two or three days after the disaster, all cadres and masses of the commune implemented the Party committee's resolution and carried out the arduous task of eliminating traces of the disaster, restoring production, and rebuilding their homes. Hu Ming, the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, personally went to the commune to direct the disaster relief work. Relevant departments also allocated disaster relief funds and commercial fertilizers. Large numbers of officers and soldiers from the Shaoguan garrison braved the rain to rebuild a solid flood control dike for the commune. Many factories and construction units in Shaoguan City also sent technicians to help rebuild factories, repair damaged cars and tractors, and worked together with commune members sent by various communes in the Shaoguan suburbs to support the construction of new villages. The concern of the higher-level Party committee and the assistance from all directions ensured that no one had to sleep in the open or go hungry, and they also received a certain amount of clothing and bedding. All of this gave the vast number of cadres and commune members new strength. It was this strength that propelled the battle to rescue the rice seedlings. Several thousand commune members, led by cadres at all levels, went down to more than 16,000 mu of flooded rice fields, individually propping up the rice leaves with ropes, scooping water to wash away the mud on the leaves, and removing the scattered stones and weeds from the fields. In some fields where even the topsoil had been washed away, people carried soil to thicken the layer and applied basal fertilizer to prepare it as a seedbed for late-season rice. After such meticulous care and the application of fertilizer, the rice seedlings, which some people had considered hopeless, were revived in just three or four days. Agricultural production was back on track.

	In order to recover the losses caused by the disaster, in addition to strengthening field management of early rice and carrying out timely sowing and raising of late rice seedlings, the most important thing for Zhangshi Commune at that time was to open up as much wasteland as possible for planting. People wanted to recover from the dry land what they had lost from the flooded paddy fields. The commune's male and female tractor drivers cleaned the mud off their tractors as soon as the flood receded, repaired the vehicles, and immediately started six tractors on the third day, working day and night to accelerate the opening of wasteland. Liu Chenggui, a communist party member who had been transferred from the army, refused to rest even when his feet hurt. When he was so tired that his eyelids were about to droop, he simply stood on the driver's seat to turn the steering wheel, so that he could open up more wasteland to recover the losses caused by the disaster. Relying on this kind of soaring enthusiasm, the tractor drivers opened up nearly 5,600 mu of wasteland after the disaster. The amount of wasteland opened in one month was nearly 90% of the total amount opened in the four and a half months before the disaster. By mid-July, the whole commune had planted more than 9,000 mu of sweet potatoes and other miscellaneous grain crops, an increase of about eight times compared to the same period last year, ranking among the top in the Shaoguan suburbs.

	While the agricultural front was engaged in an intense struggle, the commune's industry and transportation, which had been severely damaged by the flood, also resumed work at a rapid pace. The section of highway from the bank of the Beijiang River to Zhangshi Street, the center of the commune, was restored to traffic in just three days under the personal leadership of Hu Ming, the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee. The whole commune lost ten wooden sailing boats due to the disaster, but new ones were quickly purchased after the disaster, with a larger cargo tonnage than before the disaster. At this point, the transportation artery, which had once been paralyzed, was active again. The commune-run factories of Zhangshi Commune were mainly distributed along the banks of the river, and most of them were destroyed by the flood. Some people thought it would take three to five years to recover. However, with the efforts of the workers and the technical workers who came to support them, they were quickly restored. The farm tool factory lost a large number of tools such as hammers and planes in the flood, and the commune promptly allocated funds to purchase a new batch of equipment, and the workers themselves manufactured a batch, quickly resuming production.

	Rebuilding Homes

	What particularly surprised people was the addition of two brand new villages to the commune's land. These two new villages consist of a total of twelve two-story buildings with brick and stone structures and arched thin-shell roofs, with a total construction area of 7,000 square meters. At present, the vast majority of houses are entering the final stages of decoration. After the summer planting, thousands of commune members whose houses were damaged by the disaster will be able to move into bright and spacious new homes. It is said that according to conventional methods, such a large-scale project would take at least a year from preparation of materials to completion. However, due to the Party organization's strengthened leadership, vigorous mass movements, and the concentration of more than 1,000 people from the whole commune, plus the efforts of technical workers who came to support them from the city and other fraternal communes, the construction speed has been very fast. In the process of construction, the principles of designing, preparing materials, and constructing at the same time, using local materials, and working day and night were implemented, and many difficulties were overcome. In order to complete the new village as soon as possible, transportation workers drove day and night, construction workers gave up holidays, and brigades in non-disaster areas mobilized thousands or even thousands of cadres and masses to go down to the river to collect stones and pick up old bricks. Hundreds of commune members went up the mountains and down the rivers to cut and transport timber, and many commune members carried lime from dozens of miles away. It was precisely because of the soaring enthusiasm and tenacious struggle of leading cadres, workers and commune members that these two new villages were basically completed in just over forty days.

	Still a Year of Continued Leap Forward

	Only two months after the flood receded, the commune members of Zhangshi Commune, with miraculous speed, erased the traces of the disaster, rebuilt their homes, and promoted the thriving development of industry and agriculture. In the days of rebuilding their homes, many incredible things emerged. More than ten days after the disaster, the commune continued to pay wages on a monthly basis, which surprised many people. Many disaster-stricken families never imagined that their lives would be no worse than before the disaster. This situation particularly aroused people's deep thought. Guan Yingrong, the leader of the Guanwu Xiaodui of the Comprehensive Farm, had his rice seedlings washed away by the flood one year before liberation, but he still had to pay rent to the landlord, and his life became unbearable. As a result, he was forced to borrow usurious loans and sell green seedlings, with debts increasing year by year, until he was liberated. This time, many fields in their team were washed away, many houses collapsed, and many of his family's clothes were also washed away. However, this major disaster did not defeat them. The public canteen not only did not stop cooking, but also had a stable supply of rations, received relief supplies of clothing, and the new village was about to receive commune members to live in, and they could still receive wages every month. The People's Commune was even more deeply rooted in people's hearts than ever before, because all the changes after the disaster were closely related to the People's Commune, this vibrant social organization. In the brigades along the Zhangshi River, which suffered heavy disasters, many rice fields still presented a prosperous scene. In the past, not only would individual farmers not have the strength to save crops that had been so severely damaged, but even small collectives in agricultural cooperatives would find it difficult. Due to the commune's expansion of planting area and strengthened management after the disaster, this year is still a good year of continued leap forward.

    人民公社的力量
    ——记广东省樟市公社消灭灾痕的经过	莫复溥　张锦庆
    夏收时节，我们来到了广东省韶关市郊樟市人民公社。路两边，开垦的荒地铺上绿茵茵的薯苗；新栽的油茶树，吐出了片片新叶；向阳的荒坡上“东方红”拖拉机正在翻起一道道犁沟。转过一个山坳，别有一番景色：这边，小伙子们在金黄色的稻田里挥镰收刈；那边，女社员边唱山歌边栽秧。迎面，一幅更加美丽的画图又映进眼帘：两座新建的社员新村。看着这些兴旺的景象，谁能想像得到，仅在两个多月前，这个公社竟曾遭受过一场百年不遇洪水的袭击呢！
        化灾害为力量
    5月13日晚上，樟市公社上空突然雷鸣电闪，暴雨倾盆而下，一时山崩树倒，浪涛狂啸。14日凌晨二时，洪峰挟着大量沙石涌向下游，很快就漫过堤岸，猛扑田园村庄，沿河七个大队二万多亩稻田受淹，上千间民房陆续倒塌，大部分社办工厂被冲得七零八落，无数衣具和各种物资都被急流卷走，前后不过几个小时，这个广东省办得最早的人民公社，竟被摧折得面目全非。
    洪水退后，大片葱绿的禾苗被沙石和淤泥压在下面；公路、桥梁尽被冲坏，别说行车，就是人也不好走；电厂发不了电，广播器哑然无声。一些社员不由得叹息说：樟市被打得不像樟市了。
    这时，人们的心情是沉重的。要多长时间才能复原呢？人们关心这个问题。在受灾严重的综合农场炭厂下小队，虽然社员们无一伤亡，但是大部分房子倒塌了，衣被、镬碗、农具都冲走了。小队长伍学双，好容易从泥水里捡回铁锅，临时在树下烧饭，又噙着泪水去检修社员仅存的危房。这时，中共韶关市委第一书记李海涛来了，原来要入医院休养的公社党委书记杨永民也来了。两位书记向伍学双表示了慰问，答应帮助他们解决生产上、生活上的困难，同时提出，现在有了人民公社做依靠，天大的困难也能克服。党的亲切关怀，大大鼓起了社员们恢复生产重建家园的信心。
          恢复生产
    灾后两三天内，全社干部和群众执行党委的决议，进行了消灭灾痕、恢复生产、重建家园的艰巨工作。市委书记胡明，亲自到公社指挥生产救灾工作，有关部门还拨来了救灾款和商品肥料。驻韶关部队的大批官兵冒雨赶来替公社重建了一道坚实的防洪堤。韶关市不少厂矿和基建单位，也派出技术工人帮助重建工厂、抢修被冲坏的汽车和拖拉机，并且同韶关郊区各个公社派来支援的社员一起，帮助公社建设新村。上级党委的关怀，四面八方的援助，使所有的人不用露宿，没有挨饿，还领到了一定数量的衣服被褥，所有这些，都给了广大干部社员以新的力量。正是这股力量，推动了抢救禾苗的战斗。几千个社员在各级干部带领下，下到一万六千多亩被淹的禾田中，一颗颗地用绳子扶起禾叶，一勺勺的浇水冲去叶上的泥巴，拾去田里的乱石杂草。有的田连表土也被冲走了，人们就挑土培厚、加施基肥，作为晚造秧地。经过这样细致护理和追施肥料，不过三四天，原来被一些人认为无望的禾苗，恢复了生机。农业生产又有节奏地进行了。
    为了夺回受灾损失，樟市公社除了加强早稻田间管理，及时进行晚稻播种育秧外，当时最重要的是尽量开荒扩种。人们要把从水田损失去的，从旱地夺回来。公社的男女拖拉机手们，洪水一退就清理了拖拉机上的泥巴，把机车抢修好，第三天立即开动了六部拖拉机，日夜不停地加紧开荒。从部队转业归来的共产党员刘成贵，脚痛了也不愿休息，累得眼皮快要搭拉下来，就索性站在驾驶座上扳方向盘，为的是要多开荒地夺取受灾损失。就是靠着这样的冲天干劲，拖拉机手们在灾后开荒近五千六百亩，一个多月时间开的荒地，将近等于灾前四个半月开荒总量的九成。全社到7月中旬，种下番薯等杂粮作物超过九千亩，比去年同期增长八倍左右，在韶关郊区跃居上游。
    在农业战线进行紧张斗争的同时，遭受洪水严重摧残的公社工业和交通运输事业，也以飞快的速度恢复工作。从北江边起到公社中心点樟市街的一段公路，在市委书记胡明亲自领导下，只三天就修复通车。全社受灾损失了十条木帆船，灾后很快就买了新的回来，装货吨位比灾前还高。至此，一度陷于瘫痪的交通动脉又活动起来了。樟市公社的社办工厂，主要分布在沿河两岸，大多数受到洪水冲毁。有人认为非三五年不能恢复。但是，在职工们和前来支援的技术工人的努力下，很快就得到恢复。农具厂被洪水冲走了铁锤、刨刀等大批工具，公社及时拨款购置了一批新的设备，职工们又自己制造了一批，很快恢复了生产。
    重建家园
    特别引起人们惊奇的，是公社土地上新添了两个崭新的村庄。这两个新村庄，一共由十二幢砖石结构拱形薄壳楼面的两层楼房组成，全部建筑有七千平方米。现在，绝大多数房正在进入粉饰装修的收尾阶段。夏种过后，受灾塌屋的成千个社员就可以搬入明亮宽敞的新居。据说，按照常规，这么大规模的工程，从备料到建成，顶少要一年时间。但是，由于党组织加强领导，大搞群众运动，全社集中一千多人，加上从城市和各兄弟公社前来支援的技术工人的努力，工程速度一直很快。在建设过程中，实行边设计、边备料、边施工，就地取材，日夜作业，工作一环紧扣一环，许多困难都被克服了。为了早日建成新村，运输工人日夜开车，建筑工人放弃假日，非灾区的大队出动了成千以至几千的干部群众下河捞石、捡拾旧砖，数以百计的社员上山下河砍运木材，许多社员从几十里外挑来了石灰。正是由于领导干部、工人和社员干劲冲天，顽强战斗，使这两座新村在短短的四十多天内基本建成。
    仍是持续跃进的年成
    洪水退后仅二个多月，樟市公社的社员们，以神奇的速度抹除灾痕重建家园，促进工农业蒸蒸日上。在重建家园的日子里，涌现出许多令人难以置信的事情。灾后十多天，公社照常按月发放工资，使许多人惊喜交集。多少受灾的家庭，谁也想不到生活过得不比灾前差。这种情景尤其引起人们的深思。综合农场官屋小队长官英荣，解放前有一年禾苗被洪水冲坏，仍然要向地主交租，生活过不下去，结果被迫借高利贷、卖青苗，负债一年比一年重，直到解放才翻身。这次，他们队里冲坏了许多田，塌了好些房子，他家里许多衣物也被冲走。但是，这场特大灾害并没有难倒他们，公共食堂不仅没有停过伙，而且口粮供应稳定，衣物得到救济，新村即将接待社员居住，每月照样能领到工资。人民公社更是空前深入人心，因为灾后所有的变化，都是与人民公社这一富有生命力的社会组织密切相连的。在樟市河畔遭受重灾的大队里，不少稻田仍然呈现出丰茂景象。要在过去，受摧残得这般严重的庄稼，不仅单干农民没有力量挽救，就是农业社小集体，也会感到为难。由于公社扩大了种植面积和灾后加强管理，今年仍然是个持续跃进的好年成。
