How to Do a Good Job of Leading a Production Team
—An Introduction to the Leadership Methods of the First Small Team of the Xinghua Production Team, Sanqiao Commune
Wang Ruoshan, First Secretary of the Deqing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

The first small team of the Xinghua Production Team in the Sanqiao Commune of Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, is a model small team in Deqing County. The production and life of this small team are organized very well, and one of the important reasons is that it has a very good leading group.

Good Captain, Good Assistants

The nine cadres of this small team were all democratically elected by the commune members. Under the leadership of the production team's Party branch, they have, through several years of practical work, developed relatively high political awareness and strong working abilities. There have emerged a number of good cadres like the small team leader and Communist Party member Qian Maomao, who are astute, capable, and selfless. Around them, a large number of activists have been united, making the various tasks of the small team very successful.

Small team leader Qian Maomao doesn't talk much, but every sentence is earnest. He is sincere to people and active in labor. He is always at the front when going to work and at the back when finishing work, and he works conscientiously and meticulously. Except for meetings, he attends work every day. Last year, he averaged more than twenty-eight days of work per month. His wife also attended work for more than twenty-six days, which is what the masses are most satisfied with. Therefore, when he makes strict demands on the commune members in production, everyone has no objections. Qian Maomao is very concerned about the lives of the commune members, especially paying attention to running the canteen well. When he was the deputy small team leader, he ate and worked in the canteen; after he became the small team leader, he was even more serious about running the canteen well. Therefore, the canteen has been getting better and better, and it has now become a model canteen in the Sanqiao Commune. Qian Maomao consults with the masses in his work and relies on the masses to overcome difficulties. During the summer harvest and planting season, he organized cadres and commune members to discuss whether to harvest and plant early and seize the late rice crop after the early rice crop through assigning tasks, calculating the seasons, and arranging labor. This resolved the complacency of the cadres and commune members, so that the overall action of the summer harvest and planting began two or three days earlier than other small teams, and the progress was the fastest in the entire production team. It is precisely because he is good at using cadres and letting them lead the work that the cadres respect his leadership even more.

In the small team, Qian Maomao has several capable assistants. In addition to the backbone on the logistics front mentioned later, there are also Zhao Zifang on the animal husbandry front, Zhao Azi on the water conservancy front, and women's squad leader Mao Baoying. Deputy captain Zhao Zifang also serves as the head of the livestock farm and is in charge of raising pigs; he has been a water manager since the mutual aid group, so he is also responsible for the water management work of the entire small team. Zhao Zifang's characteristic is that he cannot sleep if the water is not properly released or the feed is not adequately prepared. The fields in the small team have never been short of water due to insufficient water release; the pigs in the small team's livestock farm are not only raised well but are also developing rapidly, having grown from more than thirty to ninety-seven. Because he had planned early and prepared enough feed, he was able to devote all his efforts to agricultural production during the summer harvest and planting season, leaving only two women in charge of raising pigs. Team committee member Zhao Azi (a Party member) is a fierce general, similarly characterized by leading the way and not fearing hardship. Women's squad leader Mao Baoying is the number one laborer among the women in the entire team, capable of doing everything in production. She not only takes the lead in labor but also works boldly.

In addition to taking the lead in labor and working actively themselves, each of these cadres has also united four or five activists around them, and these activists have in turn united several commune members. For example, small team leader Qian Maomao often communicates with poor peasant commune members Fu Shuimu, Shen Zilin, Zhang Shenglin, Qi Lianxin, and others. These poor peasant commune members actively report situations to him and remind him of the problems that need to be addressed in production; several of these commune members are middle-aged and elderly people who are skilled in production and have prestige among the masses. Shen Zilin (a poor peasant commune member) is an "old hand" at production, skilled in everything, and especially cherishes cattle and farm tools. The plowing team is led by him. People like this are good advisors for leading production.

Complete System

The collective leadership and division of labor responsibility system of this small team is relatively sound. The nine team committee members, three of whom serve as the captain and deputy captains, are mainly responsible for field operations, while the other members are respectively responsible for animal husbandry, living, vegetables, sideline occupations, technology, and storage. The team committee implements collective leadership through methods such as "discussion, ordering (planning), meeting, and checking." Generally, work is studied once every five to seven days, short-term plans are made, and then they are implemented to the work groups according to the division of labor. There is a small meeting every day at dinner time to gather the problems seen and the opinions heard by everyone in labor that day for timely research and resolution; there is a major meeting every three days to check the implementation of the plans by everyone in charge of the work.

Because the division of labor is clear and the responsibilities are clear, each cadre has a position, power, and responsibility, so at any time, the work is busy but not chaotic, and it is organized in an orderly manner. Each cadre plays a role. As the commune members praised, the entire leading group is like a winnowing machine, with wind on every leaf. Because the division of labor is clear and everyone shares the burden, not only is the work done well, but the cadres can all take the lead in participating in labor. The labor and the quantity and quality of the quotas completed by all the cadres in this small team can exceed those of commune members with equal labor power, so they have generally won the praise of the commune members. They said: "The cadres are working hard, we do what the cadres do, and the difficult tasks are always led by the cadres, who even do more than our commune members."

How does the team committee specifically organize the production of the commune members? According to the needs of production, the specialties of the commune members, the living conditions, the labor burden, and the leadership strength, they have divided two field operation classes and three specialized groups: animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and vegetables. The field operation classes are permanently responsible for certain fields, and the specialized groups also have clear quotas and tasks. During the busy season, a certain amount of labor is drawn from the specialized groups to invest in field labor, but the specialized work groups are generally not disrupted. When it is really needed, the small team organizes temporary shock teams. After the tasks are completed, they return to the original operation class or specialized group. This combines the regular work with the temporary shock tasks, the long-term responsibility system with the temporary responsibility system, which is conducive to improving the commune members' sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for production, and it is conducive to organizing labor competitions and inspection and evaluation.

In this production team, whether it is field operation or pig raising and vegetable planting, the commune members' labor attendance and various work tasks have quotas for everything and quotas for everyone. According to the actual completion and quality standards, inspections are carried out on the same day, and records are kept by the small team and the operation class's work recorder. After inspection, rewards and punishments are appropriately implemented. Because these systems were all formulated through mass discussion and the small team cadres can take the lead in abiding by them, they are generally implemented very well.

Outstanding Logistics Department

The logistics department of the first small team has a small number of people but undertakes half of the small team's responsibilities. It is famous throughout the commune, and the county has also organized on-site visits. The backbone of the logistics department consists of three people, all of whom are team committee members, and all of whom have the advantages of taking the lead in labor, working hard and actively, and being selfless. The entire logistics department is divided into two lines: one is the vegetable group headed by Feng Jinfu (a poor peasant, team committee member, and vegetable group leader); the other is the property management group headed by Zhao Zicai (a League member, team committee member, and full-time storekeeper) and Liu Xiaomao (a team committee member and technician). Vegetable group leader Feng Jinfu never bargains when it comes to work tasks, and he always does everything well. Although he is now the vegetable group leader, he actually manages the entire logistics work. Although he likes to meddle, he does so reasonably and is strict with himself, so people are convinced by him and he has won the support of the masses. He and his vegetable group, in addition to ensuring that the small team's one hundred and eighty-eight commune members have enough vegetables to eat, also have nearly half of their vegetables available to supply the towns. Since spring, the income from selling vegetables has reached more than seven hundred yuan. The vegetable group not only has good leaders but also good members. Zhang Shouchun, who is over sixty years old, is the father of poor peasant activist Zhang Shenglin and is also an old activist who will do whatever he is asked to do. Another poor peasant group member, Fu Shuimu, although he only helps the vegetable group for two days out of three, is equally active and responsible. When others cannot carry manure into the street, he can.

Material keeper Zhao Zicai is not only a material keeper but also the economic keeper of the canteen and the work recorder of the small team. Zhao Zicai is a member of the Communist Youth League who has studied for three years. After several years of training, he can already write and calculate and is an all-rounder in the small team. Although he does not talk much usually, he works hard in silence. When others are on vacation, he collects and organizes farm tools, working with the commune members during the day and organizing farm tools after work. After his sorting, all wooden farm tools are now coated with tung oil, and all farm tools are stored in separate warehouses, grouped by type. Wood chips and rice husks more than half a foot thick are padded under the wooden utensils to prevent moisture, and they are placed flat to prevent deformation. Bamboo utensils are dried and placed high, and iron utensils are washed, dried, and hung up or padded high. According to the principle of "centralized storage and decentralized use," a complete responsibility system has been established to ensure that a dedicated person is in charge of storage, that there is a dedicated warehouse for storage, that there is registration when leaving and inspection when entering to cancel the number, and that they are washed and returned after use. Now, the farm tools in this small team are rarely lost or damaged, and they are all prepared before each use. As the commune members said: "Since he has been in charge of farm tool storage, we have everything we need, it is convenient to use, and everyone cherishes them."

    怎样做好小队的领导工作
    ——三桥公社星华生产队一小队领导方法介绍
    中共德清县委第一书记　王若山
    浙江德清县三桥公社星华生产队一小队，是德清县的标兵小队。这个小队的生产和生活都组织得很好，重要原因之一，就是有一个很好的领导班子。
    好队长　好助手
    这个小队的九个干部，都是社员民主选举出来的，在生产队党支部的领导下，他们经过几年的实际工作锻炼，都有较高的政治觉悟和较强的工作能力，并且出现了像小队长、共产党员钱毛毛这样一批精明、能干、大公无私的好干部，在他们的周围又团结了一大批积极分子，使小队的各项工作搞得很出色。
    小队长钱毛毛，讲话不多，句句顶真，对人诚恳，劳动积极。出工走在前头，收工走在后头，干活认真、细致。除了开会以外，天天出勤。去年平均每个月出勤二十八天。他的妻子出勤也在二十六天以上，这点，群众最满意。因此他在生产上对社员要求严格，大家都没有意见。钱毛毛十分关心社员生活，特别是注意办好食堂。他担任副小队长的时候，在食堂吃饭、办食堂；后来担任正小队长了，对于办好食堂更认真，因此，食堂越办越好，现在已成为三桥公社的标兵食堂。钱毛毛在工作中有事就和群众商量，依靠群众克服困难。在夏收夏种中，他组织干部和社员，通过摆任务、算季节、排劳力，辩论了要不要早收早种、夺取晚稻超早稻的问题，解决了干部和社员的麻痹思想，使夏收夏种的全面行动比别的小队早开始二、三天，在整个生产队里进度最快。正由于他善于使用干部，放手让他们去领导工作，干部也更加尊重他的领导。
    在小队里，钱毛毛有几个得力助手，除了后面讲到的后勤战线上的骨干外，还有畜牧战线上的赵子方、水利战线上的赵阿子、妇女班长毛宝英等。副队长赵子方兼畜牧场长，管养猪；他从互助组起就当管水员，因此又负责全小队的管水工作。赵子方的特点是：水不放好，饲料不备足，就睡不着觉。小队里的田从来没有因为放水不到而断过水；小队畜牧场的猪，不但养得好，而且发展快，已从三十多头发展到了九十七头。因为早有打算，备足了饲料，在夏收夏种中，他可以抽出全力投入农业生产，只留下两个妇女负责养猪。队委赵阿子（党员）是一员猛将，同样具有带头猛干、不怕艰苦的性格。妇女班长毛宝英，在全队妇女中，劳动数第一，样样生产拿得起。她不但劳动带头，而且工作大胆。
    这些干部，除了他们本身带头劳动，积极工作以外，每一个人周围也都团结了四、五个积极分子，而这些积极分子，又分别团结几个社员。如小队长钱毛毛，还和贫农社员傅水木、沈子林、张生林、戚连欣等经常联系。这些贫农社员主动向他反映情况，提醒他生产上要抓哪些问题；这些社员好几个都是中年人和半老头子，是小队里的生产能手，在群众中有威信。沈子林（贫农社员）是生产“老把式”，样样生产在行，对耕牛、农具特别爱惜，耕田组就由他负责领导。像这样的人，是领导生产的好参谋。
    完整的制度
    这个小队的集体领导、分工负责制度比较健全。九个队委委员，其中三个人担任正副队长，主要负责抓田间作业，其他委员分别分工负责畜牧、生活、蔬菜、副业、技术、保管等工作。队委会通过“议（讨论）、订（订计划）、碰（碰头）、查（检查）”等办法，实行集体领导。一般五到七天，研究一次工作，制订小段计划，然后按照分工，落实到作业组去贯彻执行。每天吃晚饭时一次小碰头，凑凑当天各人在劳动中看到的问题和所听到的意见，及时研究解决；三天一次大碰头，检查各人分管的工作贯彻执行计划的情况。
    由于分工明确、职责分明，每个干部都有职、有权、有责，所以任何时候，工作都忙而不乱，有头有绪。每个干部都发挥作用，就像社员称赞的那样，整个领导班子，就像一只风谷车，张张叶子都有风。由于分工明确，大家分挑担子，不但工作搞得好，干部都能带头参加劳动。这个小队所有干部的劳动和完成定额的数量质量，都能超过同等劳力的社员，因此，普遍赢得了社员的称赞。他们说：“干部做活是硬碰硬，我们做啥干部也做啥，难做的总是干部带头做，还比我们社员做得多。”
    队委会怎样具体组织社员的生产呢？他们根据生产需要、社员特长、居住条件、劳力负担和领导力量，划分了两个田间操作班，以及畜牧、副业和蔬菜三个专业组。田间操作班常年固定负责一定的田片，专业组也有明确的定额任务。在大忙季节，从专业组抽出一定的力量投入田间劳动，但是专业作业组一般不打乱，确实需要的时候，由小队组织临时性的突击小组，任务完成以后，仍回原操作班或专业组。这样就把经常性的工作和临时性的突击任务、长期责任制和临时责任制结合起来，便于提高社员的生产责任心和积极性，便于组织劳动竞赛和检查评比。
    这个生产小队，不论田间操作，或者养猪种菜，社员的劳动出勤和各项工作任务，样样有定额，人人有定额，根据实际完成情况与质量标准，当天检查，由小队和操作班记工员记录，经过检查，适当执行奖惩。因为这些制度都是群众讨论制订的，小队干部又都能够带头遵守，所以一般都执行得很好。
    出色的后勤部
    一小队的后勤部，人数不多，却担当了整个小队的半壁江山，在全公社是有名的，县里也曾组织过现场参观。后勤部的骨干是三个人，都是队委委员，也都具有带头劳动、积极苦干、大公无私等优点。整个后勤部，分为两条线：一条是以冯金福（贫农、队委，蔬菜组长）为首的蔬菜组；一条是以赵子才（团员、队委、专职保管员）和刘小毛（队委、技术员）为首的财产保管组。蔬菜组长冯金福，对待工作任务从不讨价还价，做工作总是做一样好一样。他现在虽然是蔬菜组长，实际上整个后勤工作他都要管。他虽然喜欢管“闲事”，因为管得有理，而且对自己也一样严格，因此人家都服他，得到了群众的拥护。他和他的蔬菜组，除了保证小队一百八十八个社员有足够的蔬菜吃以外，还有近半数的菜可以供应城镇，从春季以来，卖菜收入即达七百余元。蔬菜组不但有好领导，而且有好组员，六十多岁的张寿春，是贫农积极分子张生林的父亲，也是叫干啥就干啥的老积极。另一个贫农组员傅水木，虽然三天中只有两天帮蔬菜组工作，但也是同样积极负责，上街挑大粪，人家挑不到他挑得到。
    物资保管赵子才，他不但是物资保管员，还是食堂经济保管员和小队记工员。赵子才是共青团员，读过三年书，经过几年来锻炼，已经会写能算，是小队里的文武全材，平时虽然不大讲话，工作却是埋头苦干。人家放假，他收集整理农具，白天同社员一起劳动，收工以后整理农具。经过他的整理，现在凡是木制农具全部涂上了桐油，所有农具全部专库分组存放，木器下面垫半尺多厚的木屑和砻糠防潮，并放置平整，以防变形。竹器晒燥搁高，铁器洗净擦干挂起或垫高。又根据“集中存放，分散使用”的原则，建立一套完整的责任制，做到专人保管，专库存放，出门登记，进门检查销号，用毕洗净归还。现在，这个小队的农具很少遗失和损坏，而且在每次使用前都准备齐全，正像社员们所说的那样：“自从他负责农具保管工作以后，要啥有啥，使用方便，大家爱护”。
