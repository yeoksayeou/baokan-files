Promoting the "Poor Stick" Spirit to Change the Face of a "Poor" County
中共唐县县委第一书记　王桂冀
First Secretary of the Tang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Wang Guiji

Before 1956, Tang County was a poor county. The county had a population of 440,000 and only 860,000 mu of arable land, of which 30% were hillside terraces and 20% were low-lying alkaline land. The entire county only had fifteen new irrigation and drainage machines and not a single tractor. Most villages still used the old and backward farming methods, so the average grain yield per mu was only 193 jin. The grain produced was not enough to eat. From 1954 to 1956, the state had to supply an average of 42.39 million jin of grain each year. The living standards of the masses were also very low.

After the publication of Chairman Mao's annotation of Wang Guofan's "Poor Stick Cooperative" in 1956, we immediately organized all the cadres and masses in the county to study and discuss it. This was a great encouragement to everyone. If the "Poor Stick Cooperative" could change its appearance, couldn't a "Poor Stick County" also change its appearance? Everyone firmly remembered Chairman Mao's words: "Can it be that 600 million poor sticks cannot, through their own efforts, become a socialist, rich, and strong country in a few decades? The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants, and laboring intellectuals themselves. As long as these people control their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, not avoiding problems but solving them with a positive attitude, any difficulties in the world can be solved." From then on, everyone was determined and ambitious to resolutely change the backward face of the "Poor Stick County." That spring, under the direct leadership of the Baoding Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, a county-wide Party representative conference was held to examine the reasons for backwardness and poverty and to formulate measures to change the situation. 1956 became a turning point in the work of Tang County. In the past few years, under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought and under the correct leadership of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Baoding Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, we have relied on the 440,000 "poor sticks" in the county to carry out a tenacious struggle against nature and have achieved great achievements. Grain production has achieved continuous leaps forward. In 1958, the average grain yield per mu in the county was 395 jin, an increase of 37.8% compared to 1957. The per-mu yield of cotton and oil crops also increased significantly compared to 1957. In 1959, the grain yield per mu reached 536 jin, an increase of 34.3% compared to 1958. The per-mu yield of cotton and oil crops also increased by more than 30% compared to 1958. With the high-speed growth of grain production, 38.47 million jin of commodity grain were sold to the state in 1958, and the commodity grain increased to 62.5 million jin in 1959. In just two years, the county changed from a grain-deficient county to a surplus grain county. This is the result of giving full play to the revolutionary "Poor Stick" spirit and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. However, the achievement of this victory was not smooth sailing. On this road of advancement, it was filled with struggles between two ideologies, two roads, and two different principles and lines.

        How to Treat Poverty

In the past few years, there has always been a fierce struggle between two ideologies on how to treat poverty. Some people believe that poverty is caused by poor natural conditions and there is no way to change it. In agricultural production, they believe that the mountainous areas and low-lying areas have poor soil quality, and there is no way to increase production without machinery and water conservancy facilities. They said: "We were born in this poor place and have been poor for generations, and we still have to suffer poverty now." Therefore, they are powerless in the face of poverty. They hold a skeptical attitude towards advanced experiences from other places, saying: "It works there, but it probably won't work here. We can't catch up with them anyway." These people have serious conservative ideas and a sense of inferiority, willingly lagging behind and admitting defeat. This is impossible, that cannot be done, they have no great ambitions and lack lofty revolutionary ideals. This is a world outlook of lazy people and cowards. These people have actually fallen into the abyss of mechanical materialism. In the past few years, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have carried out a sharp struggle against this ideological viewpoint. We are dialectical materialists, and we recognize the role of objective conditions in the development of things. Therefore, we respect the objective, strictly proceed from the objective reality, do not fantasize, do not speak empty words, do not fire empty cannons, and act according to the laws of the development of objective things. However, unlike mechanical materialists, we believe that objective laws can be recognized and mastered, and the subjective initiative of the people is an extremely great force. Countless facts have proved that through the active efforts of the people and through realistic and hard work, objective conditions can be changed, and unfavorable objective conditions can be turned into favorable objective conditions. Take the large-scale water conservancy construction as an example. First, we set ambitious goals to resolutely achieve water conservancy in the county within a few years. At the same time, we took specific measures to actively conduct surveys, make comprehensive plans, build reservoirs and rectify canals in batches and phases, and rationally arrange time and labor (generally using only one-third of the labor force during the slack farming season). In the past few years, the Tang River basin in the mountainous area has focused on the Xidayang Reservoir built in the Baoding area, and has built 182 small reservoirs and more than 48,000 gully dams and other projects upstream, which has basically cured the Tang River that has harmed the people for thousands of years. At the same time, the poor sticks in the mountainous areas launched a large-scale campaign to make terraced fields irrigated, digging mountains and splitting ridges, and have opened more than 1,700 ring-mountain canals, dug more than 810 transmission wells and built pumping stations, drawing river water to the high mountains and building water conservancy projects on 60% of the terraced fields in the mountainous areas. The plain vigorously renovated the Guangli Canal, transforming the original curved and unstraight canals into a five-level canal system of trunk, branch, fighting, farm, and hair canals, expanding the irrigated area from 90,000 mu to 400,000 mu. 1,400 motor-pumped wells are dotted everywhere, realizing the combined use of sky water, surface water, and underground water, eliminating drought land in the plain, and more than 300,000 mu of land have achieved double insurance of canal water and well water.

After the publication of Chairman Mao's article "Introducing a Cooperative" in April 1958, we organized cadres and the masses in the county to repeatedly study and discuss it. Chairman Mao told us: "The remarkable feature of China's 600 million people is that they are poor and blank. These things look bad, but they are actually good things. Poverty leads to change, to work hard, to make revolution. A blank sheet of paper, with no burden, is easy to write the newest and most beautiful words on, and easy to draw the newest and most beautiful pictures on." What a brilliant and great instruction! What a great encouragement to the "Poor Stick" County! Therefore, after study and discussion, it immediately generated infinite and enormous power among the people of the county, and established the view that "people are poor but their aspirations are not poor, and there is nothing difficult in the world as long as there is a will." People have revolutionary ideological weapons and used the proletarian revolutionary world outlook to defeat the world outlook of lazy people and cowards. A new upsurge of production immediately swept across the county. In order to further liberate the mind and speed up the pace of changing the poverty-stricken face, we have repeatedly organized cadres and the masses to visit advanced areas on a large scale. The county Party committee, the county people's committee, and the archives subscribe to newspapers from all provinces and some advanced counties in the country. When they see advanced experiences, they immediately send people to visit and study. In the past few years, a total of more than 28,500 people have been organized to visit 18 provinces and 101 counties. This has played a great role in liberating the mind and boosting morale. Since 1958, starting from "experimental fields," from high-yield plots of more than a thousand mu to high-yield plots of more than ten thousand mu, large square fields have been rectified. Now the plains have basically realized large square field management. The original uneven, scattered, and uneven small plots of land have become large square fields with a flat surface like a mirror and ridges as straight as a line. The production appearance of the small-scale peasant economy is gone forever. People have realized from their own personal struggle against nature that natural conditions can be changed, and have further strengthened their belief in "man will conquer nature" and that the face of poverty can be changed, and have developed the proletarian revolutionary spirit of working harder when poorer and working harder when more difficult. Facts have educated the masses and also educated leading cadres. The county Party committee leadership is even more convinced that as long as the conscious subjective initiative of the people is fully exerted, the potential is infinite, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome, and the face of "poverty and blankness" can be changed completely in a relatively short period of time.

Indigenous Methods, Self-Reliance, Not Being a Hand-Out Seeker

There are two different principles and lines on how to change the face of poverty: one is simply waiting for state support and relief, waiting for machines, and relying on state loans; the other is relying on the masses, using indigenous methods, and being self-reliant. The former approach is the approach of lazy people and the style of young masters. The latter approach is to give full play to the "Poor Stick Spirit" and be worthy of the heroic qualities of the poor sticks. Chairman Mao said in "On Contradiction": "Materialist dialectics holds that external causes are conditions of change, internal causes are the basis of change, and external causes play a role through internal causes." Therefore, we must strive to be strong and self-reliant – this is a Marxist-Leninist line. To be self-reliant, we must also solve an ideological problem, that is, we must have a correct understanding of indigenous methods, that is, poor methods. Some people think that indigenous methods are "backward methods," "methods of last resort," "temporary methods," and "methods when there is no way." These views are all wrong. Chairman Mao often tells us: the development of things mainly relies on its own internal forces; development is the complex process of things themselves from small to large and from low-level to high-level. Foreign things grow out of the soil and develop. In the past few years, following this principle, we have relied on the masses to be self-reliant in agriculture. For example, without tractors, we have vigorously engaged in deep plows, deep turning shovels, and hoes, and used manpower to complete the task of deep turning 580,000 mu of land; we have vigorously engaged in water conservancy, and without drainage and irrigation machinery, we have used indigenous methods to build it, and we have also used waterwheels and windlasses; if chemical fertilizers and pesticides are insufficient, we have mobilized the masses to vigorously produce indigenous chemical fertilizers, indigenous pesticides, and develop pig raising and accumulate a lot of coarse fertilizer. Because the enthusiasm of the masses has been brought into play, many things that are not easy to do have been quickly done, and the output of grain, cotton, and oil crops has been greatly increased. With the high-speed development of agriculture, there is an urgent need for industrial support, and county and commune industries have also developed using indigenous methods. We used the "ants gnawing bones" method to build indigenous machine tools, and used indigenous machine tools to make indigenous generators and indigenous electric motors to support drainage and irrigation electrification, and also made indigenous light bulbs and indigenous fiberboard. In transportation, we went from modifying rubber-tired carts to building indigenous railways relying on indigenous equipment. All this shows that those who think that indigenous methods are useless have no dialectical materialist world outlook at all and do not understand the laws of development of things at all. The facts from Tang County prove that using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and "walking on two legs" can mobilize various positive factors. Indigenous methods are the methods of mass movements. Not only do we need indigenous methods and poor methods today, but we will also need indigenous methods and poor methods in the future. Poor methods are the revolutionary methods of our proletariat. This kind of poor method is not a temporary expedient, but has infinite uses for thousands of years.

To be self-reliant, we must also adhere to the principle of diligence and thrift. With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, some people think that "it is possible to be more generous in doing things" and "don't care about this point." Some communes requested to build large auditoriums, and some county-level departments requested to build office buildings. We resolutely adhered to Chairman Mao's principle of "diligence and thrift in running all undertakings," criticized this growing idea of extravagance and waste, and organized cadres to re-study Chairman Mao's instructions on diligence and thrift. Chairman Mao told us: "China is a big country, but it is still very poor now. It will take decades to make China rich. Even after decades, we will still need to implement the principle of diligence and thrift, but it is especially important to advocate diligence and thrift and pay special attention to saving in the current decades, in the current periods of several five-year plans." Guided by Mao Zedong Thought, the atmosphere of diligence and thrift has been established, and everyone regards simplifying things, using indigenous methods where possible, and being indigenous as an honor. Since the communization, neither the county nor the communes have built large auditoriums or office buildings. Those who originally requested to build office buildings withdrew their requests. In this way, funds have been accumulated, and the funds are mainly used for industrial and agricultural construction. Since 1958, the county and commune finances have overfulfilled the revenue plan. In addition to turning over the prescribed proportion, more than 5 million yuan has been taken out to build 430 new county and commune factories and purchase 23 tractors. Since the beginning of this year, relying entirely on the county's financial resources and the strength of the masses, the 120-li power transmission network from Baoding to Wangdu Town and from Wangdu Town to Renhou Town has been completed, and 14 small power stations have been built, laying a preliminary foundation for electrification. At the same time, the small indigenous railway from Renhou Town to Wangdu Town was built. This is the victory of adhering to self-reliance and using indigenous methods. The facts in the past few years have made us deeply realize that only by being self-reliant, using indigenous methods, and using poor methods can we speed up the construction of socialism. Therefore, poor methods and indigenous methods are multi-fast, good, and economical methods. Reliance, waiting, and being a hand-out seeker, relying solely on foreign methods, are slow, poor, and costly methods.

Leading by Example in Hard Work is the Key to Implementing the Poor Stick Spirit

To adhere to the Poor Stick Spirit, leading cadres must take the lead in hard work and go to the most difficult and most difficult places. In the past few years, many cadres in our county were unwilling to go to the mountainous areas. Therefore, several secretaries of the county Party committee took turns going up the mountain, walking seventy or eighty li every day, and traveled all over every mountain top in the mountainous area, which encouraged the masses and educated the cadres. Now people are proud to go up the mountain. In daily work, leading cadres must also take the lead in hard work. I remember one night in the twelfth lunar month the year before last, the standing committee of the county party committee met until after midnight, and because they were anxious to implement it downwards, after the meeting, people consciously went to the countryside overnight in the snow. Comrade Hao Dianshi, the county head, arrived at the Chuanli Commune, 120 li away from the county seat, the next morning. During the rainy season, people often walked seventy or eighty li to the countryside in the rain, setting an example for the vast number of cadres. Living a hard and simple life and maintaining close ties with the masses are characteristics of cadres in our county. The comrades Mu Bingchen and Wei Qinghai, secretaries of the county party committee secretariat, have done the best. They work together with the masses, and no stranger can recognize who is the secretary. Wherever they go, the masses surround them and say everything. The masses call Secretary Mu "the secretary who knows our hearts." The county party committee was inspired by Comrade Mu Bingchen's close ties with the masses and launched a movement to make good friends with poor and lower-middle peasants among the vast number of cadres in the county, so that every cadre could become more familiar with the production and living conditions of the masses and maintain close ties with the masses. The county Party committee requires every party member and cadre to truly do what Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed: "The important sign of a good party member and a good leader lies in his familiarity with the living and working conditions of the people, caring about the pain of the people, and understanding the hearts of the people; he adheres to the style of hard work and simplicity, shares weal and woe with the people, is able to accept the criticism and supervision of the people, and does not put on any airs in front of the people; he consults with the masses when something happens, and the masses are also willing to talk to him. As long as our party is composed of such party members, we will always have infinite and invincible power." This brilliant instruction of Comrade Liu Shaoqi has become the motto of the vast number of party members and cadres in the county and the direction of everyone's efforts.

In order to thoroughly implement the central government's instructions on "four togethers," the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third County Party Committee decided to abolish the county-level and commune-level canteens and merge them with the rural canteens. The canteens of the county Party committee and the county people's committee took the lead in abolishing them, and the county-level and commune-level offices were also moved to the production teams. All county-level cadres engaged in rural work who were separated from production lived in the production teams and participated in labor every morning and worked in the afternoon and evening. This is the most thorough way to implement the "four togethers," it is the work style of the land reform, and it is a great revolution in ideological style. This is a great encouragement to the vast number of grass-roots cadres and the masses in the county. The development of the "four togethers" movement has led to a new upsurge of production in the county. We firmly believe that as long as we are guided by Mao Zedong Thought and under the direct leadership of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Baoding Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and rely on the people of the county to further develop the revolutionary Poor Stick Spirit, we will be able to change the face of the Poor Stick County faster and more thoroughly.

    发扬“穷棒子”精神改变“穷”县的面貌
    中共唐县县委第一书记　王桂冀
    1956年以前，唐县是个穷县，全县四十四万人口，只有八十六万亩耕地，其中还有30％是山坡梯田，20％是低洼碱地。全县仅有新的排灌机器十五台，拖拉机一台也没有，大部分村庄都是沿用着旧有的落后的耕作方法，所以粮食平均亩产仅一百九十三斤；打的粮食不够吃，1954年至1956年三年中平均每年要国家供应粮食四千二百三十九万斤，群众生活水平也是很低的。
    1956年毛主席批示的王国藩“穷棒子社”的文章发表之后，我们立即组织全县广大干部和群众进行了学习讨论。这对大家是个极大的鼓舞。“穷棒子社”能改变面貌，“穷棒子县”就不能改变面貌吗？大家牢牢地记住了毛主席的话：“难道六万万穷棒子不能在几十年内，由于自己的努力，变成一个社会主义的又富又强的国家吗？社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”从此，大家下决心、立大志，坚决改变“穷棒子县”的落后面貌。这年春天在中共保定地委的直接领导下，召开了全县的党代表大会，检查了为什么落后和穷的原因，制订了改变面貌的措施。1956年成为唐县工作的转折点。几年来，我们在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在中共河北省委、中共保定市委的正确领导下，依靠全县四十四万个“穷棒子”，向自然界进行了顽强的斗争并获得了巨大的成就，粮食产量获得了连年大跃进。1958年全县粮食平均亩产三百九十五斤，比1957年增长了37.8％，棉花、油料的亩产比1957年也有很大增长；1959年粮食亩产达到五百三十六斤，比1958年增长34.3％，棉花、油料亩产量也较1958年增长30％以上。随着粮食产量的高速度增长，1958年卖给国家商品粮三千八百四十七万斤，1959年商品粮增加到六千二百五十万斤。在短短的两年内，由缺粮县变成了余粮县。这是发挥革命的“穷棒子”精神的结果，是毛泽东思想的胜利。但是，这个胜利的取得，并不是一帆风顺的，在这一段前进的道路上，充满了两种思想、两条道路、两种不同的方针路线的斗争。
        怎样对待穷
    几年来在怎样对待穷这个问题上，始终存在着两种思想的激烈斗争。有些人认为穷是自然条件不好造成的，没有什么办法。在农业生产上，他们认为山区、洼地土质差，没有机械又没有水利条件，怎么也不能增产。他们说：“生在这块穷地方几辈子就穷，现在还得受穷”。因而在穷的面前无能为力。他们对外地的先进经验抱着怀疑的态度，说什么：“在那里行得通，在咱这里恐怕不行，怎么也赶不上人家。”这些人存在着严重的保守思想和自卑感，甘居落后，甘拜下风，这也不可能，那也办不到，心无大志，缺乏崇高的革命理想。这是一种懒汉和懦夫的世界观。这些人实际上已经陷入机械唯物论的深渊中去了。几年来我们在毛泽东思想指导下，向这种思想观点进行了尖锐的斗争。我们是辩证唯物论者，承认客观条件在事物发展中的作用，因而尊重客观，严格地从客观实际出发，不胡思乱想，不说空话，不放空炮，按着客观事物的发展规律办事。但是，我们同机械唯物主义者相反，我们认为客观规律是可以被认识、被掌握的，人民群众的主观能动作用是一个极其伟大的力量，有无数的事实证明，经过人民群众的积极努力，经过实事求是的苦干实干，客观条件是可以改变的，不利的客观条件会变成有利的客观条件。就拿大兴水利来说，我们首先立下雄心壮志，坚决争取几年内达到全县水利化，同时，采取具体措施，积极进行勘测，作出全面规划，分批分期修水库、整渠道，合理安排时间和劳力（一般都在农闲季节只用三分之一的劳力）。几年来，山区唐河流域以保定全区兴建的西大洋水库为重点，在上游修建了一百八十二座小水库和四万八千多道谷坊等工程，使几千年危害人民的唐河基本上得到了根治。与此同时，山区的穷棒子们向梯田水利化大进军，凿山劈岭，已开环山渠一千七百多道，打传道井、建扬水站八百一十余处，把河水引向高山，在山区60％的梯田上修建了水利化工程。平原大力整修了广利渠，把原来弯曲不直的渠道改建成了干、支、斗、农、毛五级渠道系统，由浇地九万亩扩浇到四十万亩；一千四百眼机井星罗棋布，实现了天上水、地上水、地下水三水并用，在平原消灭了旱地，并有三十多万亩土地达到了渠水、井水双保险。
    1958年4月毛主席《介绍一个合作社》的文章发表以后，我们组织全县干部群众进行了反复的学习讨论。毛主席告诉我们：“中国六亿人口的显著特点是一穷二白。这些看起来是坏事，其实是好事。穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”这是多么英明伟大的指示啊！这对“穷棒子”县是个多么大的鼓舞啊！因之，经过学习讨论，它立刻在全县人民中产生了无穷的巨大力量，树立起了“人穷志不穷，天下无难事，只怕有心人”的观点。人们有了革命斗争的思想武器，用无产阶级的革命世界观战胜了懒汉懦夫世界观，全县立即掀起了新的生产高潮。为了进一步解放思想，加快改变穷困面貌的速度，我们曾多次大规模地组织了干部和群众到先进地区参观，县委、县人委和档案馆订有全国各省和一些先进县份的报纸，看到先进经验，马上就派人前去参观学习。几年来共组织二万八千五百多人到十八个省、一百零一个县去参观；这对解放思想、鼓舞斗志起了很大作用。1958年以来，从“试验田”开始，由千亩以上的丰产方到万亩以上的丰产方，大整方田，现在平原基本上实现了大方园田化。由原来高低不平零星不齐的小块地变成了地平如镜、埂直如线的大园田，小农经济的生产面貌一去不复返了。人们从自己亲身向自然斗争的过程中，认识到自然条件是可以改变的，进一步坚定了“人定胜天”和穷面貌能够改变的信念，发扬了越穷越干，越难越干的无产阶级革命精神。事实教育了群众，也教育了领导干部。县委领导上更加坚信：只要人民群众自觉的主观能动作用充分发挥出来，潜力是无穷无尽的，就没有战胜不了的困难，就一定能够在较短的时期内改变“一穷二白”的面貌。
    土法上马，自力更生，不当伸手派
    怎样改变穷困面貌，有这样两种不同的方针路线：一种是单纯等待国家支援、救济，等待机器，依赖国家贷款；一种是依靠群众，土法上马，自力更生。前一种作法，是懒汉的作法，是大少爷作风。后一种作法才是发挥“穷棒子精神”，不愧穷棒子的英雄本色。毛主席在《矛盾论》中说过：“唯物辩证法认为外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用。”所以必须发愤图强，自力更生——这是一条马克思列宁主义的路线。要自力更生还必须要解决一个思想问题，就是对土办法也就是穷办法要有个正确的认识。有些人认为土法是“落后的办法”，是“不得已的办法”，是“暂时的办法”，是“没有办法的办法”。这些观点都是错误的。毛主席经常告诉我们：事物的发展主要是依靠它本身内部的力量；发展就是事物本身从小到大，从低级到高级的复杂过程。洋是从土中生长出来的，发展起来的。几年来我们遵循着这一方针，在农业上依靠群众自力更生，如没有拖拉机我们就大搞深耕犁，深翻锹、镐，用人力完成了五十八万亩的深翻地任务；大搞水利，没有排灌机械，就用土办法造，并且把水车、辘轳都使用起来；化肥和农药不足，就发动群众大搞土化肥、土农药和发展养猪，大积粗肥。由于发挥了群众的积极性，许多不容易办的事情都很快地兴办起来了，粮、棉、油料的产量大大提高。随着农业高速度的发展，迫切需要工业的支援，县、社工业也用土办法发展起来了。我们用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法造出了土机床，用土机床作出了土发电机、土电动机，支援了排灌电气化，还制出了土电灯泡、土纤维板。在运输上，由改装胶轮大车到依靠土设备修建了土铁路。这一切说明，认为土办法不顶事的人，根本没有辩证唯物主义的宇宙观，根本不懂得事物的发展规律。从唐县的事实证明，土法上马，土洋并举，“用两条腿走路”，就能把各种积极因素调动起来。土办法是群众运动的办法，不仅今天需要土办法、穷办法，今后也需要土办法、穷办法。穷办法就是我们无产阶级革命的办法，这种穷办法不是一时的权宜之计，而是千秋万岁用处无穷的。
    要自力更生还必须坚持勤俭的原则。随着工农业生产大跃进，有些人认为“办事可以大方些”了、
  “不在乎这一点”。有的公社请求盖大礼堂，县级有的部门请求盖办公大楼。我们坚决地坚持了毛主席关于“勤俭办一切事业”的原则，批判了这种滋长着的铺张浪费的思想，组织干部重温了毛主席关于勤俭的指示。毛主席告诉我们：“中国是一个大国，但是现在还很穷，要使中国富起来，需要几十年时间。几十年以后也需要执行勤俭的原则，但是特别要提倡勤俭，特别要注意节约的，是在目前这几十年内，是在目前这几个五年计划的时期内。”以毛泽东思想为指导，勤俭之风树立起来了，大家都以因陋就简、能土就土为荣。公社化以来，县和各公社都没有盖大礼堂和办公楼，原来请示盖办公大楼的人将请示收回去了。这样就积累了资金，把资金主要地用于工农业建设。从1958年以来，县、社财政超额完成了收入计划。除按规定比例上缴以外，拿出了五百多万元，新建了四百三十多座县、社工厂和购买了二十三台拖拉机。今年以来，完全靠县财政和群众力量，完成了从保定到望都镇、望都镇到仁厚镇一百二十华里的输电网，并修建了小型发电站十四处，为电气化打下了初步基础。同时兴建了仁厚镇至望都镇的小土铁路。这是坚持自力更生、土法上马的胜利。几年来的事实，使我们深深体会到：只有自力更生，土法上马，用穷办法，才能加快建设社会主义的速度。所以说穷办法、土办法是多快好省的办法。依赖、等待、当伸手派，单靠洋的，是少慢差费的办法。
    领导带头实干，是贯彻穷棒子
            精神的关键
    坚持穷棒子精神，领导干部必须带头苦干实干，到最艰苦最困难的地方去。我县前几年有不少干部不愿到山区去，于是，县委几个书记就轮流上山，每天步行七、八十里，走遍了山区每一个山头，鼓舞了群众，教育了干部。现在人们都以上山为荣。在日常工作中，领导干部也要带头苦干。我记得前年腊月一个晚上，县委常委会开到下一点，因为急着往下贯彻，散会后人们都自觉地冒雪连夜下乡。县长郝殿士同志第二天上午就到达了距县城一百二十华里的川里公社。雨季人们常常是冒雨步行七、八十里下乡，给广大干部作出了榜样。生活艰苦朴素，密切联系群众，是我县干部的一个特点，作得最好的要算县委书记处书记穆丙辰、魏青海两位同志。他们和群众一起劳动，来个生人谁也认不出哪个是书记。他们走到哪里，群众就把他们围起来，无话不说。群众都叫穆书记是“知心书记”。县委从穆丙辰同志密切联系群众中得到启发，在全县广大干部中，开展了广交贫农、下中农知心朋友运动，使每一个干部更加熟悉群众的生产、生活情况和密切联系群众。县委要求每一个党员干部都真正作到刘少奇同志指示的：“一个好党员、一个好领导者的重要标志，在于他熟悉人民的生活状况和劳动状况，关心人民的痛痒，懂得人民的心；他坚持艰苦朴素的作风，同人民同甘苦共患难，能够接受人民的批评监督，不在人民面前摆任何架子；他有事找群众商量，群众有话也愿意同他说。只要我们的党是由这样的党员组成的，我们就永远有无穷无尽的、不可征服的力量。”刘少奇同志这一英明的指示，已成为全县广大党员干部的座右铭，成为大家努力的方向。
    为了彻底执行中央关于“四同”的指示，县委三届四次全会作了决定，撤销了县级和公社机关的食堂，与农村食堂合并。县委和县人委的食堂带头撤销了，县级的和公社的办公室也都搬到生产队去办公，县级所有作农村工作的脱离生产的干部都住到了生产队，每天上午参加劳动，下午、晚上办公。这是执行“四同”最彻底的办法，是土地改革的工作作风，是思想作风上的一次大革命。这对全县广大基层干部和群众是个很大的鼓舞。“四同”运动的开展，使全县出现了一个新的生产高潮。我们坚信，只要在毛泽东思想指导下，在中共河北省委、中共保定市委的直接领导下，依靠全县人民群众，进一步发挥革命的穷棒子精神，一定能够更快地彻底改变“穷棒子县”的面貌。
