Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 15th: Pyongyang, the democratic capital of Korea, held a grand military parade and a mass demonstration of over 300,000 people today, warmly celebrating the 15th anniversary of the “August 15th” Liberation of Korea.

　　The heroic city of Pyongyang has become even more magnificent as large-scale new buildings such as the Grand Theatre, Okryu Bridge, Okryu Hall, and Moranbong Stadium have been completed just before the festival. Some new high-rise buildings have also been built around Kim Il-sung Square, where the parade and demonstration were held. The Korean people welcomed their festival in the high tide of socialist construction.

　　At 8:00 a.m., Korean Premier Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly Choi Yong-kun, and Kim Il, Hong Myung-hee, Park Jung-ae, Park Kim-chul, Kim Chang-man, Jung Il-ryong, Nam Il and other party and government leaders ascended the rostrum amidst warm applause. Soviet Ambassador to Korea, Puzanov, also ascended the rostrum.

　　Present on the reviewing stand today were all members of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association delegation headed by Li Dequan and the Soviet-Korean Friendship Association delegation headed by An Dao-xin, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries.

　　Then the military parade began. Korean Minister of National Defence Kim Kwang-hyup reviewed the troops of various services and arms arranged on the square and delivered a speech.

　　Kim Kwang-hyup first extended warm congratulations to the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the working people, and described the brilliant achievements made in various fields in northern Korea over the past fifteen years since liberation.

　　He said that the American aggressors must immediately withdraw from South Korea, and the divided Korea must be unified. He said that the entire Korean people fully support the new plan put forward yesterday by Comrade Kim Il-sung on behalf of the entire nation to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland, a plan which represents the nation's urgent desire. The Korean people are determined to further launch a resolute struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

　　He then condemned the US imperialists for intensifying their trampling of the people and undermining the armistice agreement in South Korea, and for illegally transporting atomic and missile weapons into South Korea and other provocative actions. He demanded that the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army always maintain revolutionary vigilance. He said that in order to achieve greater success in the peaceful reunification of the motherland and socialist construction, the Korean people will advance more vigorously and will forever stand guard on the eastern outpost of the socialist camp.

　　Then the march-past began. Students from the Korean People's Army Military Academy and military schools of the army, navy, and air force marched past the platform with vigorous steps, followed by neat formations of tanks, artillery, and anti-aircraft artillery. At the same time, formations of bombers and fighter planes of the People's Army Air Force flew over the reviewing stand. This heroic force, which defeated the armed aggression of US imperialism in the Korean War and made immortal contributions to defending the freedom and independence of Korea and world peace, is even stronger today.

　　After the military parade, a mass demonstration was held. The demonstrators carried portraits of Marx, Lenin, Kim Il-sung, and Choi Yong-kun, as well as portraits of leaders of various fraternal countries. They carried huge slogans and charts of various kinds. These charts showed the brilliant construction achievements made in Korea over the past fifteen years since liberation, especially in the Chollima Movement. In 1959, the total industrial output value of northern Korea reached 6.6 times that of 1944 before liberation, and this year's grain output is expected to reach about twice that of 1944.

　　The banners and placards held high by the masses read: "US imperialist aggressor troops get out of South Korea immediately!" "American aggressors get out of Japan, Taiwan, and South Vietnam immediately!" "Support and support the struggle of the Cuban people!" "Support and support the struggle of the Congolese people!"

　　When the magnificent ranks of the fully armed worker-peasant Red Guards marched past the rostrum, warm applause resounded in the square. Teams of Red Guards composed of male and female workers demonstrated the utmost vigilance of the Korean people against imperialism.

　　The mass parade was very rich and colorful. Children danced torch dances, red flag dances, and wreath dances as they passed the platform. Colorful balloons and peace doves flew into the sky from the ranks of the masses.

　　The parade ended at a little after eleven o'clock.

    新华社平壤15日电　朝鲜民主首都平壤市今天举行盛大阅兵式和三十多万人的群众游行，热烈庆祝“八·一五”朝鲜解放十五周年。
    由于节日前夕又有大剧场、玉流桥、玉流馆、牡丹峰运动场等规模宏大的新建筑物落成，使得平壤这座英雄城市更加宏伟壮丽。在举行阅兵和游行的金日成广场四周也新建起了一些高楼大厦。朝鲜人民在社会主义建设的高潮中迎接了自己的节日。
    上午八时，朝鲜内阁首相金日成、最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健和金一、洪命熹、朴正爱、朴金喆、金昌满、郑一龙、南日等党政领导人在热烈的掌声中登上了主席台。登上主席台的还有苏联驻朝鲜大使普扎诺夫。
    今天在观礼台上观礼的有以李德全为首的中朝友好协会代表团和以安道辛为首的苏朝友好协会代表团的全体成员，以及各国使节等。
    接着开始阅兵，朝鲜民族保卫相金光侠大将检阅了排列在广场上的各兵种部队，并发表了演说。
    金光侠首先向朝鲜人民军官兵和劳动人民致以热烈的祝贺，并叙述了解放后十五年来朝鲜北部在各方面取得的光辉成就。
    他说，美国侵略者必须立即从南朝鲜撤走，分裂的朝鲜一定要统一。他说，全体朝鲜人民完全支持昨天金日成同志代表全民族的迫切愿望为促进祖国的和平统一而提出的新方案。朝鲜人民决心为和平统一祖国进一步展开坚决的斗争。
    他接着谴责了美帝国主义在南朝鲜加紧蹂躏人民和破坏停战协定并把原子和导弹武器非法运入南朝鲜等各种挑衅行动。他要求朝鲜人民军官兵经常保持革命的警惕性。他说，朝鲜人民为了在和平统一祖国和社会主义建设中取得更大的成就，将更加有力地前进，并永远坚守着社会主义阵营的东方前哨。
    然后分列式开始，朝鲜人民军军官学校和陆海空军的军事学校的学员们踏着雄壮的步伐走过台前，后面相继是坦克、炮兵、高射炮兵的整齐的队列，与此同时，人民军空军的轰炸机和歼击机编队在检阅台上空飞过。这支在朝鲜战争中打败了美帝国主义的武装侵略，为保卫朝鲜的自由独立和世界和平立下了不朽功勋的英雄部队，今天更加强大了。
    阅兵式后，举行了群众游行。参加游行的群众抬着马克思、列宁和金日成、崔庸健的画像以及各兄弟国家领袖的画像，他们抬着巨大的各种标语和图表。这些图表显示了朝鲜解放后十五年来，特别是在千里马运动中取得的辉煌的建设成就。1959年朝鲜北部工业总产值达到解放前1944年的六点六倍，今年的粮食产量预计约可达到1944年的二倍。
    群众高举的横幅和标语牌上写着：“美帝国主义侵略军立即从南朝鲜滚出去！”“美国侵略者立即从日本、台湾、南越滚出去！”“支持声援古巴人民的斗争！”“支持声援刚果人民的斗争！”。
    当全副武装的雄壮的工农赤卫队的队伍走过主席台前时，广场上响起了热烈的掌声，一队队的由男女工人组成的赤卫队表明了朝鲜人民对帝国主义保持着最大的警惕。
    群众游行十分丰富多彩，儿童们跳着火炬舞、红旗舞、花圈舞走过台前。彩色的气球和和平鸽从群众行列中飞向天空。
    游行到十一时多结束。
