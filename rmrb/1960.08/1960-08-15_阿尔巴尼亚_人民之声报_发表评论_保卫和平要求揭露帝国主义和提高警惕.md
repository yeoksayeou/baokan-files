Xinhua News Agency, August 14th — The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published a commentary on the 6th, titled "Defending Peace Requires Exposing Imperialism and Raising Vigilance," saying that what appears before us today is: on the one hand, the process of the socialist system is developing and strengthening irresistibly, and on the other hand, the capitalist system is disintegrating and collapsing. The absolute advantage of socialist forces over capitalism is an important feature of current international life.

The growth and consolidation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the collapse of the colonial system and the establishment of vast peace zones, the development of the international communist and workers' movement, the expansion of the world peace forces, the massive scale of the anti-imperialist movement in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and all other factors leading to changes in the balance of power in favor of socialism, have created the possibility, under present conditions, of avoiding world war and striving for the victory of the idea of peaceful coexistence.

The commentary then said, however, that guaranteeing peace and avoiding war cannot be achieved automatically, because the imperialists will not voluntarily give up war and aggression, will not voluntarily give up their conspiracies to seize the freedom and independence of the peoples of all countries, and will not voluntarily give up their sinister aims of trying to eliminate socialism and any progressive and democratic movements on the earth. These are closely linked to the socio-economic system of capitalist countries itself. This system is the source of the imperialists' warlike and predatory policies. The 1957 Moscow Declaration of Communist and Workers' Parties stated: "As long as imperialism exists, there is a breeding ground for wars of aggression."

The commentary said that in order to avoid war, it is first necessary to increasingly strengthen and consolidate the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is the decisive guarantee of world peace; it is necessary to unite the forces of the peoples of all countries against the danger of war, against the imperialists' preparations for war and attempts to launch war; it is necessary to raise the revolutionary vigilance of the masses and unremittingly expose the imperialists, especially the US imperialists. The people and their mass struggles can stop the aggressors, and the people and their resolute actions can tie the hands and feet of the imperialists.

The commentary said that international events, especially recent events, most clearly show that the imperialists, headed by the US imperialists, are constantly plotting against peace, frenziedly preparing for war, and openly threatening the freedom and independence of the peoples of all countries. After US imperialists sent spy planes to invade the Soviet Union, they sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference expected to be held in Paris; the United States increased its military budget and announced the resumption of atomic weapons testing. Due to their negative attitude of using negotiations as a guise to deceive the people, the Geneva disarmament talks could not proceed. It is also worth mentioning the threats and pressures exerted by the United States on Cuba, and the open military actions taken by the colonialists against the freedom and independence of the Congo.

Is all this a casual and temporary manifestation of imperialist policy, or a manifestation of individual errors of the current chieftain of the imperialist world? Only by isolating current international events from each other, only by failing to view these international events in light of a longer period of time, and only by being deceived by the ever-changing tactics of imperialist policy, can one have such a view. The above manifestations, as well as all similar manifestations in the past, only illustrate one issue: imperialism, headed by US imperialism, remains as loyal to its aggressive nature as in the past, is the enemy of peace and the freedom of the peoples of all countries, is a frenzied reactionary in all aspects, and is a permanent danger to world peace. The above manifestations also illustrate that although the capitalist system is rotting day by day and the positions of capitalism are weakening day by day, due to the strengthening of the socialist camp and the world peace movement, and due to the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles of the peoples of all countries, the vigilance of the peoples of all countries must be strengthened, and the struggle of the peoples of all countries to tie the hands and feet of the warlike jackals must be forever active and resolute. If the imperialists dare to launch a war, then the war will inevitably bring about their final destruction.

The commentary pointed out that the powerful socialist camp is the main obstacle to the imperialists' realization of their aggressive conspiracies. Therefore, all the spearheads of US imperialism are directed at the socialist camp, at the unity of the socialist camp. The Yugoslav revisionists are playing a leading role in serving imperialism in realizing these sinister attempts. The international communist and workers' movement has quite rightly given the Yugoslav revisionists the title of "Trojan horse." The experience to date clearly shows that the Yugoslav revisionists have tried their best to use the counter-revolutionary conspiracies planned in Hungary in 1956, to use sabotage and espionage, and to use rumors, slanders and conspiracies to complete the tasks they are assigned. If we say that the number one enemy of world peace, the freedom and national independence of the peoples of all countries, and socialism and communism is US imperialism, then it can be boldly said that the loyal running dog to realize the above conspiracies is the Yugoslav revisionists, the Tito clique. Therefore, while striving for peace, opposing the imperialists' preparation and launching of a new war, and raising the revolutionary vigilance of the masses against the imperialist war provocateurs, it is necessary to resolutely oppose and thoroughly expose the Yugoslav revisionists and raise revolutionary vigilance against their conspiratorial activities.

The commentary said that under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist Labor Party, the Albanian people are fighting to defend peace and to establish the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence. The Albanian Party and Government have supported and continue to support the proposals of the Soviet Government aimed at establishing peace and repelling war. The Albanian Party and Government have fought and continue to fight for the normalization of relations between the Balkan countries, and for making the Balkan and Adriatic region a zone of peace. However, while resolutely fighting for peace, the Albanian people have never relaxed and will never relax their vigilance. They will, according to the teachings of the Party, "hold a pick in one hand and a gun in the other." Because the enemies of Albanian freedom and independence have consistently plotted conspiracies against the freedom of the Albanian people. On the one hand, the US imperialists, and on the other hand, the servants of US imperialism who geographically surround Albania, have never ceased their active opposition to Albania since the establishment of the people's regime. The conspiracies, subversions and sabotages, threats, espionage activities, and armed provocations by land, sea and air, which the imperialists and their servants have plotted in the past and are plotting now, are countless. But all this has been, and will be, met with shameful failure, because the Albanian Party and people have been and are vigilant, and have always been on full alert; because Albania is a member state of the Warsaw Treaty; because Albania has had and continues to have the support and assistance of the socialist camp, especially the great Soviet Union.

The commentary concluded by saying that the Albanian people must strengthen their revolutionary vigilance against any acts of aggression by the imperialists and their running dogs, and must continue to relentlessly expose the dangerous enemy of peace and the freedom of the peoples of all countries—US imperialism, and relentlessly expose the loyal servants of imperialism, the Yugoslav revisionists. The Albanian people will strengthen their unity with the countries of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and their internationalist unity with the entire international communist and workers' movement, and with the peoples of all countries who oppose imperialism and strive for freedom and national rights.

    保卫和平要求揭露帝国主义和提高警惕
    保障和平和避免战争并不能自动实现。因为帝国主义者不会自愿放弃战争和侵略。为了避免战争，就必须首先日益加强和巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结，就必须联合各国人民的力量反对战争危险，反对帝国主义备战和发动战争的企图，必须提高群众的革命警惕性和不懈地揭露帝国主义特别是美帝国主义者，必须坚决反对和彻底揭露南斯拉夫修正主义者。
    新华社14日讯　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”6日以“保卫和平要求揭露帝国主义和提高警惕”为题发表评论说，今天出现在我们眼前的是：一方面社会主义制度的进程正在不可抑制地发展和加强着，而另一方面资本主义制度正在解体和崩溃。社会主义力量压倒资本主义的绝对优势是当前国际生活中的重要特点。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的壮大和巩固，殖民主义制度的崩溃和广大和平地区的建立，国际共产主义和工人运动的发展，全世界和平队伍的壮大，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲反帝运动的巨大规模以及导致有利于社会主义力量对比所发生的变化的其他一切因素，在目前条件下已为避免世界大战和争取和平共处思想的胜利创造了可能性。
    评论接着说，但是，保障和平和避免战争并不能自动实现。因为，帝国主义者不会自愿放弃战争和侵略，不会自愿放弃夺取各国人民自由和独立的阴谋，不会自愿放弃企图在地球上消灭社会主义和任何进步与民主运动的罪恶目的。它们是同资本主义国家的社会经济制度本身紧密联系着的。这种制度就是帝国主义好战掠夺政策的根源。1957年共产党和工人党莫斯科宣言说：“只要帝国主义还存在，就有发生侵略战争的土壤”。
    评论说，为了避免战争，就必须首先日益加强和巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结，这是世界和平的决定性的保证；就必须联合各国人民的力量反对战争危险，反对帝国主义备战和发动战争的企图；必须提高群众的革命警惕性和不懈地揭露帝国主义特别是美帝国主义者。人民及其群众性的斗争可以制止侵略者，人民及其坚决的行动可以束缚住帝国主义者的手脚。
    评论说，国际事态，特别是最近的事态，最清楚地表明了：以美帝国主义者为首的帝国主义者不断制造反对和平的阴谋，狂热地备战和公然威胁各国人民的自由和独立。美帝国主义者派间谍飞机侵犯苏联以后，破坏了预期在巴黎举行的四国政府首脑会议；美国增加军事预算，并宣布重新进行原子武器试验。由于他们利用谈判作为欺骗人民的幌子的消极态度，使得日内瓦裁军谈判无法进行。还应该提一提美国对古巴所施加的威胁和压力以及殖民主义者对刚果的自由和独立所采取的公开的军事行动。
    难道说，这一切是帝国主义政策偶然的和临时的表现，或者是目前帝国主义世界头子的个别错误的表现吗？只有把当前国际事件相互割裂，只有不根据一个较长时期的情况来看待这些国际事件，只有被帝国主义政策屡屡变化的手法所欺骗，才会有这样的看法。上述表现以及过去的类似这样的一切表现，都只说明了一个问题：以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义仍然像过去一样忠于它的侵略本性，是和平和各国人民自由的敌人，在一切方面都是疯狂的反动派，是世界和平的永久危险。上述表现还说明了：虽然由于社会主义阵营和世界和平运动的加强，由于各国人民反帝和反殖民主义斗争的结果，资本主义制度一天天在烂下去，资本主义的阵地在日益削弱，但是各国人民的警惕性必须加强，各国人民束缚好战豺狼手脚的斗争必须永远积极和坚决地进行。如果帝国主义者敢于发动战争，那么，战争将不可避免地给他们带来最后的灭亡。
    评论指出，强大的社会主义阵营是帝国主义实现侵略阴谋的主要障碍。因此，美帝国主义的一切矛头都指向社会主义阵营，指向社会主义阵营的团结。南斯拉夫修正主义者在为帝国主义效劳以实现这些阴险企图方面起着首要的作用。国际共产主义和工人运动完全正确地给予了南斯拉夫修正主义者“特洛伊木马”的称号。至今为止的经验清楚地说明了，南斯拉夫修正主义者竭力企图利用如1956年在匈牙利策划的反革命阴谋，利用破坏和间谍活动，利用造谣诬蔑和阴谋诡计来完成他们所担负的任务。如果我们说世界和平各国人民自由和民族独立、社会主义和共产主义的头号敌人是美帝国主义，那么可以大胆地说，实现上述阴谋的忠实走狗就是南斯拉夫修正主义者，就是铁托集团。因此，在争取和平、反对帝国主义者准备和发动新战争、提高群众对帝国主义战争挑拨者的革命警惕性的同时，必须坚决反对和彻底揭露南斯拉夫修正主义者，提高对他们阴谋活动的革命警惕性。
    评论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民在马克思列宁主义的劳动党的领导下，为保卫和平、为确立列宁主义的和平共处原则而斗争。阿尔巴尼亚党和政府过去和现在都支持苏联政府旨在确立和平和击退战争的建议。阿尔巴尼亚党和政府过去和现在都为巴尔干各国关系正常化，为使巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区成为一个和平区而斗争。但是，阿尔巴尼亚人民坚决为和平而斗争的同时，从未放松也不会放松警惕。他们将根据党的教导，“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”。因为阿尔巴尼亚自由和独立的敌人一贯策动反对阿尔巴尼亚人民自由的阴谋。一方面是美帝国主义者，另一方面是地理上包围阿尔巴尼亚的美帝国主义的仆从们，从人民政权建立以来，他们就从未停止过积极反对阿尔巴尼亚的活动。帝国主义者及其仆从过去和现在所策动的阴谋、颠覆和破坏活动、威胁、间谍活动、陆海空的武装挑衅，是不计其数的。但是所有这一切都遭到了，而且还会遭到可耻的失败，因为阿尔巴尼亚党和人民过去和现在都警惕着，一贯严阵以待；因为阿尔巴尼亚是华沙条约的成员国；因为，阿尔巴尼亚过去和现在都有社会主义阵营，特别是伟大的苏联的支持和帮助。
    评论最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民必须加强对帝国主义者及其走狗的任何侵略行为的革命警惕性，必须继续无情地揭露和平和各国人民自由的危险敌人——美帝国主义，无情地揭露帝国主义的忠实仆从南斯拉夫修正主义。阿尔巴尼亚人民将加强同以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营各国的团结，同整个国际共产主义和工人运动、同反对帝国主义争取自由和民族权利的各国人民的国际主义的团结。
