    Pyongyang, Hero City, in New Attire	Lin Ji
    On the eve of the 15th anniversary of Korea's liberation on August 15 this year, Pyongyang, rebuilt after the war, is welcoming the completion of a new batch of buildings, making this hero city even more magnificent.
    Pyongyang, an ancient city with a history of 1,533 years, has undergone earth-shaking changes in the last decade. During the war, American imperialism dropped more than 420,000 bombs on it, turning the city into ruins. After the war, the Korean people carried out unprecedented large-scale construction, building Pyongyang into a new type of socialist city more magnificent than in any previous era. In the past seven years, more than 70,000 houses, more than 100 schools, more than 70 factories and enterprises, and many office buildings, theaters, and shops have been built in Pyongyang. Now, Pyongyang's urban area is full of wide, straight roads, lined with five- and six-story buildings.
    The new buildings completed before "August 15th" this year include the Grand Theatre, Okryu Bridge, Okryu Hall, the National Central Liberation Struggle Museum, the Central Art Museum, the Moranbong Stadium, and the Daedongryeong residential area. The characteristics of these buildings are their large scale, high quality, and fast construction speed. Their completion has given Pyongyang a new look and made it even more radiant.
    Look at the largest theater in Korea, the Grand Theatre with two thousand seats, which stands at the junction of Stalin Street and Korean People's Army Street. Its construction area is more than 28,000 square meters and has more than 260 rooms. It has the latest stage equipment—four movable stages and fifty-eight curtains. From the outside, this magnificent 48-meter-high building looks like a phoenix about to take flight, with layers of golden and magnificent eaves like the wings of a phoenix. The floors and pillars inside are made of white, smooth marble, making people feel like they have entered a crystal palace. It truly deserves to be called an art palace with national form and socialist content.
    Pyongyang has two rivers, the Taedong River and the Potong River. Before "August 15th," new scenery appeared on both rivers.
    The Potong River is Pyongyang's "Dragon Beard Ditch," which used to be a stinking ditch. Today, earth-shaking changes have taken place here. The Potong River's channel has been widened and straightened into a canal, and the banks have been paved with wide, tree-lined roads made of cement bricks, planted with green pines and willows, making it a good place for swimming and boating in summer and ice skating in winter. The newly renovated Potong Gate (an ancient city gate of Pyongyang, one of the eight scenic spots of Pyongyang) reflected in the calm river water also appears particularly beautiful. In such a beautiful place, a brand-new residential area appeared on the Daedongryeong on the bank of the Potong River before "August 15th." Two years ago, this was still a vegetable garden. Last year, a batch of residential buildings appeared here. This year, before "August 15th," more than 1,000 new apartment buildings were newly built. Now, what is displayed before people is a newly built 60-meter-wide and 5-kilometer-long avenue, with rows of neat five-story residential buildings standing on both sides. People proudly call this place "Communist Avenue."
    On the rippling Taedong River, a newly built, Korea's largest highway bridge—Okryu Bridge—spans the east and west of the river. This cement bridge, 680 meters long and 28.5 meters wide, can accommodate six cars side by side on the bridge deck, which is more than twice the size of the Taedong Bridge next to it. In the past, it took the Japanese imperialists more than four years to complete the bridge piers when they built the Taedong Bridge. Now, the Okryu Bridge was completed in only one and a half years. Next to the Okryu Bridge on the west bank of the Taedong River, a magnificent banquet hall—Okryu Hall—has also been newly built, with yellow tiles and white walls, flying eaves and brackets, facing the vast river in front, and the emerald mountains of Moranbong on the left, in the best scenic spot in Pyongyang.
    In addition, the National Central Liberation Struggle Museum and the Central Art Museum were built in front of Kim Il-sung Square. The Moranbong Stadium, which was rebuilt near Mao Zedong Square, has also been completed. This stadium can accommodate 70,000 spectators, and the national games celebrating the 15th anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation will be held here.
    Eulmildae and Choesungdae on Moranbong, and Ryongwang Pavilion and Taedong Gate on the banks of the Taedong River, and other scenic spots and historical sites have also been renovated before the festival. Ancient buildings with carved beams and painted pillars are looming among the green trees and under the weeping willow branches, showing the atmosphere of the ancient capital of the Korean people, adding beauty to Pyongyang's "First Scenic Spot."
    These new buildings in Pyongyang were all built in just over a year from last year to this year, truly at "Chollima" speed. During these days, in order to complete these buildings as soon as possible to welcome the national holiday, the workers on every construction site in Pyongyang launched a heated labor competition, and more than 50 large and middle school students also participated in the voluntary labor of building Pyongyang, contributing more than 1.2 million workdays this year alone. The working people of various parts of northern Korea also worked together to support the construction of Pyongyang. Forest workers from the foot of Mount Paektu sent timber, steel plants sent steel bars, and workers from the Rakwon Machine Factory manufactured a large number of tower cranes and other construction machinery for the builders of Pyongyang... Tens of millions of working people's hands in northern Korea have put on a brilliant and dazzling festive attire for the beloved democratic capital.
    During these days, how many cranes in the sky over Pyongyang were waving their arms busily; the convoys transporting building materials and the machines mixing concrete made huge roars, shaking the earth; the loudspeakers on the construction site broadcast the news of the heroic struggle of the South Korean people against American imperialism and the Huh Jung group. In order to welcome the great national holiday and to support the struggle of the South Korean people, the workers, students, and cadres participating in the construction became more and more enthusiastic. At the Grand Theatre construction site, we interviewed Li Mingyuan, a female worker whose hometown is in South Korea. In order to speed up the construction and support the struggle of the people in her hometown, she mechanized the plastering work in May. In the past, one person could only plaster an average of eight square meters a day by hand, but after mechanization, it was increased to fifteen square meters, and the quality was guaranteed. The twenty young people on this construction site also organized an "August 15th" commando team, climbing more than 40 meters into the air, undertaking all the dangerous and arduous work of nailing the eaves, and completing twice the labor quota every day. In this way, the workers on this construction site built the Grand Theatre, which is larger than the largest building in Korea built during the Japanese rule—the "Central Hall" in Seoul—in about a year and a half, while the Japanese took thirteen years to build the "Central Hall" (i.e., the Japanese Governor-General's Office at the time).
    The construction speed of new buildings can also be seen from a building and a person. The National Central Art Museum in front of Kim Il-sung Square was contracted by the Korean People's Army. Construction only started on April 1 this year, and it was originally planned to build the walls before "August 15th" and complete it by the end of the year. However, the progress of this project simply exceeded people's imagination. Only two months after construction started, the walls had already been built, and it is now about to be completed. On this construction site, a miracle of one person building 18,000 bricks a day appeared, which is equivalent to building one brick every one and a half seconds on average. When Han Gap-soo, a soldier of the People's Army, was building bricks, five young men found it too busy to supply bricks. When people asked him how he learned this skill, he said: "Two hands that defeat American imperialism, plus a heart to build the motherland, can do anything."
    All the Korean people regard Pyongyang as a symbol of Korea in the "Chollima" era, a glorious banner of socialist construction, and a beacon for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. In order to build Pyongyang more beautifully, every Korean has contributed his greatest strength and wisdom. (Attached picture)

    英雄城平壤的新装	林基
    在今年8月15日朝鲜解放十五周年的前夕，战后重建起来的平壤，又迎接一批新的建筑物落成，使得这座英雄城市更加宏伟壮丽。
    平壤，这座有一千五百三十三年历史的古城，在最近的十年内经历了天翻地覆的变化。在战争时期，美帝国主义向这里扔下了四十二万多颗炸弹，把这座城市炸成了一片废墟；战后，朝鲜人民进行了空前规模的大建设，把平壤建设成比过去任何年代都更加壮丽的社会主义新型城市。七年来，平壤市内建设了七万户住宅、一百多所学校、七十多座工厂企业和许多办公楼、剧场、商店等。现在，平壤市区内到处都是宽阔笔直的大路，路旁都排满了五层和六层的大楼。
    今年“八·一五”前夕落成的新建筑物，有大剧场、玉流桥、玉流馆、国立中央解放斗争博物馆、中央美术博物馆、牡丹峰运动场、大驼岭住宅区等。这些建筑物的特点是规模大、质量高、建设的速度快，它们的建成使得平壤的面貌又为之一新，更加放射出美丽的光彩。
    请看，在斯大林大街和朝鲜人民军大街衔接点上矗立起来的朝鲜最大的剧院——有二千个座位的大剧场，它的建筑面积有二万八千多平方米，共有二百六十多个房间，有最新式的舞台装置——四座活动舞台和五十八道幕。从外面看，这座四十八米高的宏伟的建筑物，好像一只展翅欲飞的凤凰，一层叠一层的金碧辉煌的飞檐像凤凰的翅膀。室内的地面和柱子都是白色的光洁的大理石砌成的，人们走进去就像进了水晶宫。真不愧为民族形式社会主义内容的艺术宫殿。
    平壤有两条江，一是大同江，一是普通江。“八·一五”前夕，在这两条江上都出现了新的景致。
    普通江是平壤的“龙须沟”，过去是一条臭水沟。今天这里已经发生了翻天覆地的变化。普通江的河道，被加宽取直变成为一条运河，两岸用水泥砖砌成了宽阔的林荫路，栽满了苍松和翠柳，成为夏天游泳、划船、冬天滑冰的好地方。倒映在静静的江水中的刚刚重修过的普通门（平壤的一座古城门，是平壤八景之一）也显得格外美丽。就在这样一个美丽的地方，普通江畔的大驼岭在“八·一五”前夕出现了一片崭新的住宅区。这里在两年前，还是一片菜园。去年，这里出现了一批住宅大楼。今年，“八·一五”前又新建成了约一千多户新的楼房住宅。现在，展现在人们眼前的是一条新修成的六十米宽、五公里长的大马路，两旁齐齐整整地站起了一排排的五层住宅楼房。人们骄傲地把这里叫作“共产主义大道”。
    在碧波荡漾的大同江上，一座新建成的朝鲜最大的公路桥——玉流桥横跨大江东西。这座长六百八十米、宽二十八点五米的水泥桥，桥面上可并行六辆汽车，比同它并列的大同桥大一倍多。过去日本帝国主义建设大同桥，用了四年多的时间才打完了桥墩。现在，玉流桥只用一年半就修成了。在大同江西岸玉流桥旁边，还新建起一座宏伟的宴会厅——玉流馆，黄瓦白墙，飞檐斗拱，前面临着浩渺的江水，左侧就是牡丹峰的翠丽的山峦，正在平壤的风景绝佳处。
    另外，金日成广场的正面建设起了国立中央解放斗争博物馆和中央美术博物馆。在毛泽东广场附近重新改建的牡丹峰运动场也落成了，这个运动场可容七万观众，庆祝“八·一五”解放十五周年的全国运动会就要在这里举行。
    牡丹峰上的乙密台、最胜台，大同江畔的练光亭、大同门等各处名胜古迹，也都在节日前夕进行了修缮，在绿树丛中、垂柳枝下掩映着一座座雕梁画栋的古代建筑，显出了朝鲜人民的古都的气派，为平壤的“第一江山”平添了一番美丽。
    平壤这些新建筑，都是在从去年到今年的一年多的时间内建成的，真正是“千里马”的速度。在这些日子里，为了早日建成这些建筑物迎接民族节日，平壤的每一个建设工地上的工人们，都展开热火朝天的劳动竞赛，五十多个大、中学校的学生们也参加了建设平壤的义务劳动，仅今年就贡献了一百二十多万个工。朝鲜北部各地劳动人民也一齐努力支援平壤的建设，白头山麓的森林工人送来了木材，各钢铁厂送来了钢筋，乐元机械厂的工人为平壤建设者制造了大批的塔式起重机等各种建设机械……。朝鲜北部千千万万只劳动人民的手，给心爱的民主首都披上了灿烂夺目的节日新装。
    在这些日子里，平壤上空多少架起重机一齐忙碌地摇动着臂膀；运送建筑材料的车队和搅拌混凝土的机器发出巨大的轰鸣，震动着大地；工地上的扩音器里广播着南朝鲜人民进行英勇的反对美帝国主义和许政集团的斗争的消息。为了迎接伟大的民族节日，为了支援南朝鲜人民的斗争，参加建设的工人、学生、干部越干越欢。在大剧场工地上，我们访问了故乡在南朝鲜的女工李明源。她为了加快建设速度，支援故乡人民的斗争，在5月份把抹灰作业机械化了。过去用手工一人一天平均只能抹灰八平方米，可是实现机械化后，就提高到十五平方米，而且保证了质量。这个工地上的二十名青年，还组织了“八·一五”突击队，攀登上四十多米的高空，把全部钉房檐的危险艰巨的工程包了下来，而且每天完成了劳动定量的两倍。这个工地上的工人们就这样用大约一年半的时间，建成了这座规模比日本统治时期建设的朝鲜最大建筑物——汉城的“中央厅”还大的大剧场，而日本人建设“中央厅”（即当时的日本总督府）时却前后用了十三年的时间。
    从一座建筑物和一个人，也可以看出新建筑物的建设速度。金日成广场前的国立中央美术博物馆，是由朝鲜人民军包修的。今年4月1日才动工，原计划在“八·一五”砌好墙壁，在年底建成。可是这个工程的进展简直是超过了人们的想像。动工才两个月，墙壁已经砌完了，现在已经快要建成了。就在这个工地上，出现了一个人一天砌砖一万八千块的奇迹，这等于平均一秒半钟就砌一块砖。这个名叫韩甲洙的人民军战士，当他砌砖时，五个小伙子供砖就感到忙不过来。当人们问他这个本领是怎样学来的时候，他说：“打败美帝国主义的两只手，加上建设祖国的一颗心，就可以作到任何事情。”
    全朝鲜人民都把平壤当作“千里马”时代的朝鲜的象征，社会主义建设的光辉旗帜、和平统一祖国的灯塔。为了把平壤建设得更加美丽，每个朝鲜人都献出了自己的最大的力量和智慧。（附图片）
