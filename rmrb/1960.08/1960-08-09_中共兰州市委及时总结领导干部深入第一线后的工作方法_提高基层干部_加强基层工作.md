(Our Dispatch from Lanzhou, August 8) The Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the CCP recently studied and summarized the working methods of leading cadres of factories and mines after going deep into the production front lines, and promptly put forward the instruction that "after cadres go down, they should be advisors, not do everything themselves."

Since the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the CCP began implementing the "one, two, three" (one day a week for study, two days for meetings and collective office work, and three days for going deep into the production front lines) work system in June, cadres have generally left their offices. After the cadres went deep into the grassroots, two kinds of ideology, work styles and methods appeared: one is to regard the revolutionary cause as the people's own cause, believe in the power of the masses, so after going deep into the grassroots, they adopt an attitude of education and help towards the grassroots cadres, inspire their consciousness, and participate in the struggle with them, help them improve their working methods, thereby effectively improving the ideological awareness and work level of the grassroots cadres. For example, after the leading cadres of the Lanzhou Municipal Engineering Company went to the construction site, they found that the grassroots cadres at the construction site had a mentality of dependence, thinking that when the leading cadres come down, many problems can be solved directly by relying on the leaders. In response to this ideological situation, the leading cadres of this company insisted on handling affairs in accordance with the organizational system and never did everything for them. Chen Wanbang, deputy secretary of the company's Party committee, went to the Eighth Construction Site and found that the plan for this construction site was not detailed enough and the construction trenches were unreasonable. He accompanied the construction site director to the site, and used the method of careful accounting to help him improve the construction method and arrange the construction progress, so that the project at this construction site was completed one day ahead of schedule. This not only gave play to the enthusiasm of the grassroots cadres, but also improved the level of grassroots cadres in managing production. After the leading cadres of the Lanzhou Water Pump Factory went deep into the production front line, they inspired the grassroots cadres to grasp the key issues in production, grasp the weak links, grasp the backward teams, and grasp the summary of new things and the promotion of advanced experience, thereby strongly promoting production.

However, there are still a few cadres who, after going deep into the grassroots, take care of everything, worry about everything, and are busy with everything, resulting in what the workers reflect: "When the cadres come down, production goes up; when the cadres go up, production goes down."

After discovering and studying these problems, the leading comrades of the Municipal Committee promptly convened a meeting to affirm that the method of being an "advisor" is good, and required that after the leading cadres go deep down, the most important thing is to help the grassroots cadres establish a system of collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility, help the grassroots cadres arrange production, work, and study, give full play to the wisdom of the masses, and continuously improve the political and ideological level and work level of the grassroots cadres to ensure the continuous leap forward in production.

Now, the leading cadres at all levels in Lanzhou City have actively improved their working methods according to the instructions of the Municipal Committee.

    中共兰州市委及时总结领导干部深入第一线后的工作方法
    提高基层干部　加强基层工作
    本报兰州8日电　中共兰州市委最近研究总结了厂矿企业领导干部深入生产第一线以后的工作方法，及时提出了“干部下去后要当参谋，不要包办代替”的指示。
    中共兰州市委自从6月份开始实行“一、二、三”（一星期中，一天学习，两天开会和集体办公，三天深入生产第一线）工作制度以来，干部普遍走出办公室。在干部深入基层以后，出现了两种思想作风和工作方法：一种是把革命事业看作是人民群众自己的事业，相信群众的力量，因此深入基层以后，对基层干部采取教育、帮助的态度，启发他们的自觉性，和他们一起参加斗争，帮助他们改进工作方法，从而有效地提高了基层干部的思想觉悟和工作水平。例如，兰州市政公司的领导干部下工地以后，发现工地基层干部有依赖思想，认为领导干部下来了，许多问题就可以依靠领导上直接去解决了。这个公司领导干部针对这种思想情况，坚持按组织制度办事，绝不包办代替他们来工作。公司党委副书记陈万邦下到第八工地，发现这个工地计划安排得不细致，施工基槽不合理，就陪同工地主任一起到现场去，用算细账的方法，帮助他改进施工方法和安排施工进度，使这个工地的工程提前一天完工。这样不仅发挥了基层干部的积极性，而且提高了基层干部管理生产的水平。兰州水泵厂领导干部深入生产第一线以后，启发基层干部抓生产中的关键问题，抓薄弱环节，抓落后班组，抓新生事物的总结和先进经验的推广，从而有力地推动了生产。
    但是，还有少数干部，深入基层以后，什么事都包揽下来，一个人操心，一个人忙，结果像工人反映的那样：“干部下来，生产上去；干部上去，生产下来”。
    市委领导同志发现和研究了这些问题以后，及时召开了会议，肯定了当“参谋”的办法好，要求领导干部深入下去后，最主要的是帮助基层干部建立集体领导和分工负责制度，帮助基层干部安排生产、工作、学习，充分发挥群众智慧，使基层干部不断提高政治思想水平和工作水平，保证生产的持续跃进。
    现在，兰州市各级领导干部已根据市委指示，积极改进自己的工作方法。
