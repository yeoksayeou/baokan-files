    City Fertilizer to the Countryside
    China has dozens of large and medium-sized cities with hundreds of thousands of urban residents. The excrement, garbage, and industrial wastewater and waste produced daily are considerable in quantity and are all excellent fertilizers. Chinese farmers have traditionally used these fertilizers. Since liberation, cities have taken active measures to use large quantities of manure for agricultural production. However, upon closer inspection, the potential in this area is still enormous. If this potential can be fully tapped, it will be a significant contribution to the development of agricultural production in urban suburbs.
    As early as eighty years ago, Engels discussed this issue in "The Housing Question." Using London as an example, he pointed out that under the capitalist system with its urban-rural opposition, it was necessary to "spend enormous sums of money daily to dump more manure than is produced by the whole Kingdom of Saxony into the...sea," wasting enormous wealth. In China, urban manure was not fully utilized before liberation either. Many farmers who wanted to use urban manure were obstructed by "manure bullies" seeking profit. Only today, with the establishment of increasingly close socialist urban-rural relations, is it possible to fully utilize urban fertilizer resources for production.
    City fertilizer going to the countryside is another concrete manifestation of the new type of relationship of mutual support and cooperation between urban and rural areas in our country. It is an important task for cities to support rural areas and strengthen urban-rural relations.
    Organizing city fertilizer to go to the countryside is a very complex and meticulous task. Strengthening the Party's leadership is necessary to do this work well. We must strengthen the political and ideological work among urban residents, so that the broad masses of urban residents consciously regard sending city fertilizer to the countryside as a practical action to implement the principle of "taking agriculture as the foundation" and supporting agricultural production. We must also strengthen political and ideological work among the members of the people's communes in the suburbs, so that the broad masses of commune members, in the process of digging and transporting fertilizer, help the cities do a good job in sanitation, and ensure that fertilizer transportation and sanitation work are taken care of simultaneously.
    Doing a good job in organization is also very important. The city's municipal engineering, environmental sanitation, housing management, transportation and other departments must closely cooperate under the unified leadership of the Party, and give full play to the role of the urban and rural people's communes, and rely on the strength of the broad masses of commune members, to ensure that urban fertilizer sources are thoroughly tapped, transported in a timely manner, and handled cleanly.
    Making the work of city fertilizer going to the countryside regularized, institutionalized, and consolidated for the long term is an important issue that all cities should seriously address. Urban management departments, construction departments, and industrial departments should closely cooperate, combine with their professional work, and do this work better. For example, urban management departments should establish and improve a complete set of systems for urban fertilizer management and city fertilizer going to the countryside; industrial departments should research and manufacture cleaning machinery to realize the mechanization of this work; urban construction departments, when formulating long-term plans, must also proceed from the viewpoint of being conducive to production, comprehensively consider the treatment and utilization of feces, sewage, and waste, and build some necessary projects to strive to ensure that all urban fertilizer is returned to the fields.

### 城肥下乡

    城肥下乡
    我国大中城市不下几十个，城市人口数十万，每天产生的粪便、垃圾和工厂的污水、污物，数量很大，并且都是很好的肥料。我国农民历来就有使用这些肥料的习惯。解放以后，各个城市也都采取了积极措施，使大批的粪肥用于农业生产。但是仔细检查起来，这方面的潜力还很大，如果把这些潜力都挖掘出来，对于发展城市郊区的农业生产将是一项重大的贡献。
    早在八十多年以前，恩格斯在“论住宅问题”一书中，就曾经谈到过这个问题。他用伦敦的例子说明，在资本主义城乡对立的社会制度下，不得不“每日都要花费巨额资金，才能把较之全萨克森王国所生产的更多的粪倾抛到……海里去”，巨大的财富被白白浪费掉了。在我国，解放以前城市粪肥也没有得到充分利用。许多农民想利用城市的粪便，又受到以渔利为目的的粪霸的梗阻。只有在今天，在建立起日益密切的社会主义城乡关系之后，才有可能把城市肥源充分用于生产。
    城肥下乡是我国城乡之间互相支援，互相协作的新型关系又一具体体现，是城市支援农村，密切城乡关系的一项重要工作。
    组织城肥下乡，是一件十分复杂和细致的工作，要加强党的领导，才能把这个工作作好。要加强对城市居民的政治思想工作，使广大城市居民自觉地把城肥下乡，作为贯彻执行“以农业为基础”，支援农业生产的实际行动。对郊区人民公社社员也要加强政治思想工作，使广大郊区公社社员在挖肥、运肥过程中，帮助城市搞好卫生工作，作到运肥和卫生工作同时兼顾。
    作好组织工作也是十分重要的。城市的市政工程、环境卫生、房屋管理、交通运输等部门都要在党的统一领导下，密切协作，并充分发挥城市和农村人民公社的作用，依靠广大社员的力量，才能保证城市肥源挖的彻底，运的及时，搞的干净。
    使城肥下乡的工作经常化，形成制度，长期巩固下来，是各个城市都应该认真解决的一个重要问题。城市管理部门、建设部门和工业部门应该密切协作，结合业务工作，使这个工作作得更好。比如城市管理部门要建立和健全城肥管理和城肥下乡的一套完善的制度；工业部门则应研究和制造清洁机械，使这项工作实现机械化；城市建设部门在制订长远规划时，也必须从有利于生产的观点出发，全面考虑粪便、污水、污物的处理利用，建设一些必要的工程，力争作到城市粪肥全部归田。
