Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 18th: The workers of Guangdong's four major coal mines – Qu Ren, Nanling, Lianyang, and Luojiadu – are, with the support of all sectors across the province, exerting even greater effort to launch a labor emulation campaign to increase production and practice economy. From August 1st to 14th, the average daily output of raw coal at these four mines increased by 5.28% to 88% compared to the same period in July.

According to the instructions of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on increasing coal production, the workers of these four coal mines have recently launched a labor emulation campaign to increase production and practice economy. This has led to a continuous increase in raw coal production and a steady improvement in tunneling progress. In the first ten days of August, the total tunneling footage of these four major coal mines reached more than 6,400 meters, an increase of 8.88% compared to the same period in July. At Luojiadu Coal Mine, the average daily footage of some key tunneling faces reached two to three meters in the first ten days of August. In the competition, leading cadres of each mine went deep into the front line of production, established underground offices in various work areas, and led workers to set up material warehouses and electromechanical maintenance teams at the wellhead. This changed the old leadership method of "production underground, command above ground," making leadership work more suited to the needs of production development. After Qu Ren Coal Mine established an underground office, it ensured that major problems were handled overnight, medium problems were handled within the shift, and minor problems were handled immediately, ensuring the smooth progress of production.

All sectors of the province are very concerned and supportive of the coal mine workers' competition activities. The machinery manufacturing department rushed to produce 120 rock electric drills for roadway tunneling; the Electric Power Bureau allocated 12,000 meters of cable to complete the sets of these electric drills and put them into production. The transportation department guaranteed priority transportation of equipment and materials for the four major coal mines and took many measures to increase the volume of coal transportation. At one point, Qu Ren Coal Mine urgently needed pit props, and the Guangzhou Railway Administration took the initiative to dispatch vehicles to rush 300 cubic meters of pit props to the coal mine in a timely manner, strongly supporting the mine's production. The postal and telecommunications departments set up dedicated telephone lines for the four major coal mines and added postal and telecommunications service points. Commercial and grain departments shipped large quantities of raincoats, mining rubber shoes, and other daily necessities needed by miners to the mining areas.

Chongqing

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 18th: Chongqing's steel and coal production increased substantially in the first half of August. Compared with July, the daily output of these products increased by 14.91% for steel and 41.83% for iron; the output of raw coal from the city's large coal mines increased by 8.33%, and coke increased by 12.5%.

Since the beginning of August, workers in Chongqing's steel, coal, and transportation units, focusing on key and weak links in production, have vigorously studied and promoted new technologies and experiences, and have tried in every way to allow the achievements of the technical revolution to play a greater role in production. Workers at the Gailan District Steel Plant combined their desulfurization technology experience created in the technical revolution movement with the experience of learning from other districts, summarized and improved it, made it a complete set, and incorporated it into operating procedures. This increased the in-furnace desulfurization rate to 90%, ensuring the high yield and quality of converter steel throughout the plant. All converter plants in the city have widely promoted the experience of this plant, and the desulfurization rate and the output and quality of steel have rapidly improved. After the Second Converter Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company promoted this experience, the steel output immediately increased by 8%. After workers in various iron plants in Ba County widely promoted the advanced technical experience of increasing the wind temperature and increasing the air volume on hot-blast stoves, the average daily output of pig iron in the county increased by 57.88%, the coke ratio decreased to 0.893, and the sulfur content of pig iron decreased to 0.098%.

Anyang Iron and Steel Company

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 17th: In the first half of August, the average daily output of pig iron, steel, and steel products at Anyang Iron and Steel Company in Henan Province increased by 1.3%, 46.9%, and 0.7% respectively compared with the same period in July. The output of ore, coke, and other products also increased significantly.

Since the beginning of August, in order to tightly grasp the key links of raw material supply, product quality, and equipment maintenance, the company has concentrated manpower and material resources to organize a mass movement to tackle key problems. The workers of the steelmaking plant focused on improving the life of furnace linings and pig iron furnaces, and established a complete set of systems from the workshop to the team to control the quality at each level. This quickly increased the life of the pig iron furnace lining from being able to smelt 90 furnaces of steel to more than 200 furnaces, and the life of the converter lining also increased from 22 furnaces to 33.8 furnaces, with a maximum of 53 furnaces, ensuring a significant increase in steel production. The ironmaking plant also took measures to greatly improve the quality of raw materials charged into the furnace, ensuring that the raw materials charged into the furnace had no large pieces, no powder, and no impurities.

Banshan Iron and Steel Plant

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 17th: Banshan Iron and Steel Plant in Zhejiang Province achieved new achievements in high quality and high yield in the first half of August. Comparing the period from the 1st to the 15th with the same period in July, iron production increased by 30%, steel production increased by 97%, steel product production increased by 80%, and coke production increased by 43%; the quality of steel and coke both improved significantly, and the pass rate of pig iron has remained at 90%-100%.

Since the beginning of August, the workers of Banshan Iron and Steel Plant have continued to carry out mass movements of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping, and workshops, work sections, teams, and the same types of work have launched hook-up competitions with each other. The coking and sintering workshops have strengthened measures in many ways to improve the quality of coke and ore, creating favorable conditions for the realization of high quality, high yield, and low consumption in steel production. Transportation workers built a belt conveyor with a length of 800 meters for the coking workshop, so that the produced coke can be directly sent to the furnace side, improving work efficiency. The leading cadres of this plant adhere to the practice of going to the front line of production separately, directly participating in labor, strengthening team work, and explaining and implementing the production plan to the masses at all levels. They pay attention to the implementation of the plan before and after each shift every day, strengthening on-site command and dispatching work.

Qingdao's Three Steelmaking Units

This newspaper reports: Qingdao Bicycle Factory, Vehicle Factory, and State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6, three national red flag steelmaking units, have achieved significant results in the first ten days of August. The 0.5-ton converter of the Bicycle Factory overfulfilled the average daily production plan by 26.1%, an increase of 63.69% compared with the same period in July, and the quality pass rate was 97.63%. The two sets of 0.5-ton converters of the Vehicle Factory used pig iron with a sulfur content of 0.8 to 1 to make steel, and the output increased by 38.97% compared with July, and the quality increased by 6.24%. The steelmaking workers of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6 have improved the pig iron furnace, and production has also improved.

In order to ensure the high quality and high yield of steel in August, these three factories held worker oath-taking rallies at the beginning of the month, and formulated guarantee conditions and action measures from the bottom up. Subsequently, the leading cadres immediately went deep into the front line and solved the key production problems practically by working, eating, living, and studying with the workers. The leading cadres of the Bicycle Factory, who went deep into the workshop and participated in labor with the workers, first improved the wind-eye angle of the pig iron furnace, enlarged and increased the hot-blast kiln of the furnace, increased the heat-receiving area, and increased the wind temperature. Therefore, the hot air temperature increased from 300 degrees to more than 400 degrees, and the melting efficiency of the pig iron furnace was shortened from 25 minutes to 30 minutes to melt one furnace of molten iron in the past to 15 minutes to 20 minutes to melt one furnace of molten iron.

In order to seize high quality and high yield, the steelmaking workers of these three factories have launched counterpart competition. Teams and individuals are chasing each other, unwilling to lag behind. In the counterpart competition, various departments have further strengthened the shift handover system. Teams are not only competitors but also collaborators, which has played a significant role in improving the quality and output of steel. (Attached picture)
