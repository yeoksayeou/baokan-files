    Visiting the Sick Three Times
    Lu Minghan, a salesperson at the Xinji Pharmacy on Sichuan North Road in Shanghai, carefully inquires about the patient's condition whether he is selling a single pill or filling a prescription, ensuring the "right medicine for the ailment." One night, an old man came to buy antidiarrheal pills for his wife. While selling the medicine, Lu Minghan asked in detail about the patient's age, address, temperature, and the number of times she had diarrhea. After the old man left, Lu Minghan felt it might be enteritis or dysentery, and antidiarrheal pills wouldn't help; she needed to be treated in the hospital immediately. The more Lu Minghan thought about it, the more worried he became. He thought, if it's acute enteritis, there's no time to waste. So he found the patient's home and saw that the old woman didn't even have the strength to speak. He helped the patient get dressed and sent her to the hospital. Halfway there, the old couple thanked him profusely and finally persuaded Lu Minghan to go back. Early the next morning, as soon as Lu Minghan got off work, he visited the patient's home without rest. He saw the old woman lying in bed groaning, her face very pale. It turned out that the old woman was afraid of injections and blood tests, so she turned back halfway. Lu Minghan patiently explained the necessity of seeking medical attention promptly. At three or four o'clock in the afternoon, Lu Minghan visited the patient's home for the third time. The old couple were very moved and told him that they had been to the hospital. The old woman said, "Luckily we went early, or I wouldn't have been able to bear it." (Hù Míng)

    三探病人
    上海四川北路新剂药房的售货员陆明汉，不论是卖一颗药片还是配一张处方，都要仔细询问病情，做到“药物对路”。一天半夜里，一位老伯伯来替他的老伴买了止泻药片。陆明汉一边卖药一边详细询问了病人的年龄、住址、体温情况和肚子泻的次数。老人走后，陆明汉觉得可能是肠炎，也可能是痢疾，吃止泻片不管用，需要马上送医院治疗。陆明汉越想越不放心，他想，如果是急性肠炎，哪里能拖时间。于是找到病人家里，见老太太连说话也没力气，就帮病人穿好衣服，送她上医院；送到半途，老夫妻俩千谢万谢地才把陆明汉劝回去。第二天清早，陆明汉一下班，顾不得休息又去访问病家，只见老太太躺在床上呻吟，脸色很不好；原来，老太太怕打针、验血，半途又折了回来。陆明汉耐心向她说明及时就医的必要性。下午三、四点钟，陆明汉第三次访问这个病家，老夫妻见了非常感动，告诉他已经上过医院了，老太太说：“幸亏去得早，再拖下去就吃不消了。”　（沪名）
