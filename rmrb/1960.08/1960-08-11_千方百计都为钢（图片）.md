Everything Possible is Being Done for Steel

A new high tide of steel production has been launched in Sichuan Province. The workers of steel plants are working hard and skillfully, making great efforts in technical revolution, and striving for high-quality and high-yield. Workers in coal mines, iron mines, and transportation departments are working together, doing everything possible to increase steel production. Leading cadres of all units go deep into the front line, eating, living, working, and discussing with the workers. In this production upsurge, moving deeds continue to emerge. Here are just a few glimpses.　Our reporter You Yunggu took these photographs.

Raising the red flag of the Sichuan Province small converter technical revolution, the Yongchuan Iron and Steel Plant actively promotes advanced experience and carries out technical transformation of the pig iron furnace, further improving the steel production and quality. Sparks are flying, golden light is shining, and another furnace of good steel is produced.

At the Mojang Coal Mine in the Leshan Special Zone, 95% of the cadres have set up camp on the front line of production. Zhang Cunzheng (first from the right in the front row), the secretary of the mine's Party committee, is working with the workers in the underground office to improve underground transportation in order to increase the "fuel" for the steel plant. The little train is racing. A large amount of raw coal produced by the Mojang Coal Mine is being continuously sent for coking.

Workers at the Dongba branch of the Jialing Iron and Steel Plant in Guangyuan County have created an automatic mud gun, which greatly reduces the physical labor of the furnace workers who block the taphole, and can also avoid burns. Furnace workers Gu Huaibin (right) and Xu Gang are happily installing the mud gun.

Sichuan Province's red flag for mine technical transformation - the Lijia Mountain Iron Mine, adopts a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, relying on its own efforts, to create a network of mine transport cableways. A large number of ores are transported directly down the mountain along multi-line linked cableways.

    千方百计都为钢
    四川省掀起了钢铁生产新高潮。钢铁厂职工实干巧干，大闹技术革命，力争优质高产。煤矿、铁矿、运输部门的职工齐心协力，千方百计为钢铁增产效力。各单位领导干部深入第一线，和工人同吃，同住，同劳动，同商量。在这一生产高潮中，动人事迹不断涌现。这里纪录的仅仅是几个侧面。　本报记者　游云谷摄
    高举四川省小转炉技术革命红旗的永川钢铁厂，积极推广先进经验，对化铁炉进行技术改造，进一步提高了钢的产量和质量。钢花四溅，金光闪闪，又是一炉好钢。
    乐山专区沫江煤矿95％的干部，到生产第一线安营扎寨。矿党委书记张存正（前右二）正在井下办公处和工人一起研究改进井下运输，以便为钢铁厂增产更多的“粮草”。小火车在奔驰。沫江煤矿生产的大批原煤被源源不断地送去炼焦。
    广元县嘉陵钢铁厂东坝分厂的职工创造了自动泥炮，大大减轻了炉前工堵铁口的体力劳动，并且可以避免烧伤事故。炉前工顾怀斌（右）和许刚正在愉快地装泥炮。
    四川省矿山技术改造的红旗——李家山铁矿，采取土洋结合、自力更生的办法，大搞矿山运输索道成网联动化。大批矿石沿着多线联动索道直接运往山下。
