    Gift Across the River
    Zou Deming
    In the winter of 1957, our production team lost a small colt. We searched for it for over a month but couldn't find it.
    Our production team was separated from Korea only by the Yalu River. When winter came, the river froze over, and the colt crossed the river on the ice. Once across the river, it couldn't find its way home and ran around aimlessly in the snow.
    In Tonggoumen Village, Korea, there was an old man named An. One day, he had just returned from a labor model conference in Daoli when he saw this colt wandering around unattended, so he took it back with him. He inquired around, again and again, but couldn't find out where it came from. Finally, he figured it out: this horse probably came from China. From then on, he took even better care of the colt.
    One night, it was dark, and the colt fell ill. Old Man An braved the wind and snow in the dark to go to the city, more than ten li away, to fetch a veterinarian. He also cooked rice porridge for the colt every day. After a full month of care, the colt was finally happy again.
    In the blink of an eye, nearly a month had passed.
    Ever since losing the colt, everyone in the production team had been worried and sent people to inquire everywhere every day. One day, while the troops were in a meeting, a call came from the county saying, "Tonggoumen Village on the other side of the river has found a colt, probably from your team." Everyone was overjoyed to hear this. That night, Team Leader Li completed the formalities for going abroad, and the next day he crossed the river.
    Meanwhile, Old Man An, knowing that Chinese friends were coming to retrieve the horse, slaughtered a pig and prepared twenty Korean dishes, with all kinds of cooking methods: frying, stir-frying, braising, and deep-frying. He also prepared a large jar of wine. Once everything was ready, he went more than ten li outside the village to meet them.
    When Team Leader Li and Old Man An met, it was like old friends meeting after many years. Talking and laughing, they arrived at Old Man An's house before they knew it.
    Old Man An invited Team Leader Li inside. Team Leader Li entered the house and saw pictures of Chairman Mao and Commander Kim hanging on the wall, and the table was full of food and wine. Old Man An asked Team Leader Li to sit down, and Team Leader Li sat down cross-legged. Old Man An took two large bronze bowls, filled them with wine, and was about to toast with Team Leader Li. Team Leader Li couldn't refuse and began to eat and drink.
    After the meal, Old Man An invited Team Leader Li to get the horse. Team Leader Li went to the horse pen and saw at least a thousand horses. Old Man An said, "These belong to our farm." Old Man An led Team Leader Li to a colt and said to him, "This is your colt." Team Leader Li looked, and the colt had grown up! Its fur was as shiny as black satin, and its buttocks were as round as a ball.
    At that moment, Old Man An turned around, returned to the house, and carried out a bag of things. He said to Team Leader Li, "Please take these things back with you!" Team Leader Li didn't want to take them. Old Man An became anxious, "These apple seeds and pear seeds were given by the farm members, not for you, but for Chairman Mao, for your village." Team Leader Li had no choice but to accept them.
    When Team Leader Li returned, he planted the apple seeds and pear seeds on the hillside and tended to them year after year. Now they bear apples and pears.
    Before we knew it, two years had passed. In the autumn of 1958, one morning, a call came from the county: "A Korean delegation is coming to visit your village." Everyone was so happy when they heard this news that they jumped for joy. On that day, all the team members, men and women, old and young, went outside the village to welcome them. After a while, a Korean delegate arrived. Guess who it was? It turned out to be Old Man An.
    Team Leader Li was so happy that he couldn't even speak. The two hugged each other. Everyone gathered around and extended their arms to shake hands.
    Old Man An toured the team for half a day. He saw the management area's home for the elderly, nursery, chicken farm… and nodded continuously, saying, "Good!" He also visited the indigenous fertilizer factory and the farm tool factory. The more Old Man An looked at these two factories, the better they seemed, and the more he felt they were the right path. He quickly asked, "Who came up with this idea!" Everyone said together, "This is the idea of the Party and Chairman Mao."
    At noon, the team invited Old Man An to a banquet in the canteen and asked him to taste the apples and pears from the back hillside.
    After the meal, Old Man An was about to leave. The members all came to the canteen to see him off. The elementary school students brought large cucumbers, and the pig farm brought two white breeding pigs. They brought all kinds of gifts, everything was complete. Old Man An didn't know whose to accept, if he accepted this one and not that one, that one would be unhappy; if he accepted that one and not this one, this one would be unhappy. Old Man An stroked his beard and thought for a long time before saying, "Alright, I accept your good intentions, and I will accept all your gifts!" Just then, Team Leader Li arrived carrying a bag of indigenous fertilizer, followed by four young men carrying an automatic rice transplanter. When Old Man An saw the indigenous fertilizer and the automatic rice transplanter, he quickly said, "Good! Good! Old Li's gift is exactly what I wanted, I was just looking for this thing!"
    A month later, we saw many automatic rice transplanters on the plains across the river. And on the mountains across the river, there were piles of white smoke rising, we knew that Old Man An and their farm had also started a fertilizer factory.

    隔江的礼物
    邹德明
    1957年冬天，咱们生产队，丢了匹小儿马。找了一个多月也没找着。
    咱们生产队跟朝鲜只隔一条鸭绿江，到了冬天，江封冻了，小儿马踩着冰就过了江。过了江它就找不到家了，在雪地里乱跑一气。
    朝鲜通沟门村，有个姓安的大爷。这天，他刚打道里开劳动模范会回来，一看这小儿马没人管，就牵回去了。他四下打听，打听了一遍又一遍，也没打听出来是哪里的。临末他寻思到了，这儿马备不住是中国的，打那以后，他侍弄小儿马就更加细心了。
    有天下黑，小儿马病了，安大爷黑灯瞎火的，冒着大风大雪到十来里地的城里去请兽医。他还天天给小儿马熬大米粥喝，足足将养了一个月，小儿马才算欢似了。
    说话快个把月就过去了。
    生产队自打丢了小儿马后，大伙都着急，天天派人四处去打听。一天，部队正开会呢，县里来了电话说：“江对岸通沟门村拾了一匹小儿马，大概是你们队的。”大伙听了这话，都乐坏了。当晚李队长办理了出国手续，第二天就过江了。
    再说安大爷知道中国朋友要来取马，他就杀了一口猪，做了二十个朝鲜菜，真是烹炸熘炒样样都有，还预备了一大坛子酒。预备妥了，就到村外十多里路去接。
    李队长和安大爷一见面，就像多年没见面的老朋友一样。有说有笑，不觉就到了安大爷家。
    安大爷让李队长进屋。李队长就进屋了，他一看：墙上挂着毛主席和金司令的像，桌子上摆满了酒菜。安大爷叫李队长坐，李队长也就盘腿坐下了。安大爷拿了二个大铜碗，斟满了酒，就要和李队长碰杯。李队长实在推辞不过去，就吃喝上了。
    吃完饭安大爷就请李队长去牵马。李队长到马栅一看。马足有千八百匹，安大爷说：“这是咱们农庄的。”安大爷把李队长领到一匹小儿马跟前对他说：“这就是你们的小儿马。”李队长一看哪！那匹儿马可长大了，毛像黑缎子似的铮亮，屁股蛋子圆的像个球。
    这阵，安大爷转身回到屋里，扛来一面袋子东西。对李队长说：“这点东西请你捎回去吧！”李队长哪里肯要。安大爷可急眼了，“这苹果籽、梨籽是咱庄庄员送的，不是给你的，是给毛主席的，是给你们村的。”李队长没法也就只好收下了。
    李队长回来就把苹果籽、梨籽种在山坡上，成年累月地莳弄它。到现在都结苹果、梨了。
    不觉两年过去了。1958年秋后，一个早上，县里来了电话：“一位朝鲜访华代表要到你们村去访问。”大伙听了这消息，乐的直蹦。到了那天，全队社员男女老少都到围子外边去接。不一会来了一位朝鲜代表同志，你说是谁呢？原来就是安大爷。
    这下子，李队长乐的连话也说不出来，两个人就抱在一块了。大伙也都围上伸出了胳膊要握手。
    安大爷在队里参观了半天，他看了管理区的敬老院、托儿所、鸡场……不住地点头说：“好！”还参观了土化肥厂和农具厂，安大爷看着这两个工厂愈看愈觉得好，愈看愈觉得是个道道。他忙问：“这是谁出的主意！”大伙一块说：“这是党和毛主席出的主意。”
    晌午了，队里请安大爷在食堂里吃酒席，还请他尝了尝后山坡上的苹果、梨。
    吃过饭，安大爷要走了。社员们都到食堂来欢送。小学生抱来了大黄瓜，猪场赶来了两头白色的种猪。送啥的都有，可齐全呢。安大爷不知要谁的好，接了这个不接那个，那个不高兴；接了那个不接这个，这个不高兴。安大爷理着胡子寻思了半天才说：“好吧，你们的心意我领了，你们的东西我也全收下！”正在这时候，李队长扛着一袋子土化肥来了，后面还跟着四个小伙抬架自动插秧机。安大爷一看是土化肥和自动插秧机，忙说：“行！行！老李的礼物，正合我的心思，我正想要这玩艺呢！”
    过了一个月，就见江对岸的平地上，摆着不少自动插秧机。江对岸的山上呢冒起了一堆堆的白烟，才知道安大爷他们农庄也办起化肥厂了。
