Xinhua News Agency, Handan Electric Dispatch: The Julu Ironworks in Handan City has adopted a method of "Conquering a key area and then solidifying it with a system," promptly establishing and improving various production management systems, promoting an all-round leap forward in production. In the first half of this year, the entire plant completed half of its annual production task thirteen days ahead of schedule, the qualified rate of pig iron reached 91%, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces frequently remained above one ton, and the cost per ton of pig iron in June decreased by 23.5% compared to the beginning of the year. In the rainy month of July, the output of small blast furnaces throughout the plant remained stable, and the qualified rate of iron increased to 92.5%.

This factory launched three factory-wide key project battles this year to improve product quality and output, and adopted the method of "Conquering a key area and then solidifying it with a system" to consolidate the achievements of the mass movement. At the beginning of the year, small blast furnaces were mostly using high-quality ore and burning coke last year. After most were switched to using ore powder and blending with white coal, the quality of pig iron declined. At this time, the entire plant launched a battle to tackle raw material issues and improve pig iron quality. All employees wrote big-character posters, offering suggestions. As a result, it was discovered from thousands of big-character posters that the low quality of pig iron was due to the fact that the ore powder was not washed and sorted when pressed into spherical shapes for sintering, containing a large amount of mud and impurities, resulting in low iron content and high sulfur content. However, if the ore powder were washed, the viscous soil would be washed away, and the ore powder could not be pressed into spheres for sintering. In response to this problem, employees proposed improving the method of sintering ore powder so that the ore powder could still be sintered after washing.

Based on the reformed sintering method and the other opinions put forward by employees, the factory leadership formulated a set of raw material management systems. After the implementation of this system, the iron content of sintered ore powder increased from 31.92% to 51.37%, and the sulfur content decreased by 60%, reaching the quality level of rich iron ore, and consolidated this achievement. This enabled the small blast furnaces to produce high-quality iron entirely from ore powder.

The quality of pig iron rose rapidly, but the growth rate of output was not fast. The leadership organized employees to launch a major battle to "break through the strong wind and high temperature barrier" of small blast furnaces to increase output. After the furnace temperature increased and the output rose rapidly, 50 operational procedures and management systems were formulated for furnace front, engine room, and material distribution based on the experience gained in the key project battle, in order to consolidate the achievements.

Since the beginning of this year, this factory has launched three factory-wide key project battles in succession. In order to consolidate the experience gained in these three battles and maintain the level achieved during the battles, the factory established and improved a set of post responsibility systems and technical operating procedures for 26 major production links, from the production management of raw materials such as mining, coal washing and coking, and ore powder sintering, to furnace front operation, desulfurization, chemical analysis, and even the storage and delivery of pig iron. Through conducting mass competitions and inspections, every worker recognized the importance of adhering to the system, thereby consciously abiding by the system, maintaining the system, and ensuring the continuous leap forward in production.

### 及时建立制度巩固革新成果  巨鹿炼铁厂坚持推行攻关战役创造的经验生产持续上升

    及时建立制度巩固革新成果
    巨鹿炼铁厂坚持推行攻关战役创造的经验生产持续上升
    新华社邯郸电　邯郸市巨鹿炼铁厂采取“攻克一关，就用制度巩固一关”的办法，及时建立和健全了各项生产管理制度，促进了生产全面跃进。今年上半年，全厂提前十三天完成了全年产量任务的一半，生铁合格率达到91％，小高炉平均利用系数经常保持在一吨以上，6月份每吨生铁的成本比年初降低了23.5％。在多雨的7月份，全厂小高炉产量稳定，铁的合格率提高到92.5％。
    这个厂今年为了提高产品质量和产量，发动了三次全厂性的攻关战役，并采取“攻克一关，就用制度巩固一关”的办法，巩固群众运动的成果。年初，小高炉由去年大部分吃好矿石、烧焦炭，改为大部分吃矿粉、掺烧白煤以后，生铁质量下降。这时，全厂发动了攻原料关、提高生铁质量的战役。全厂职工写大字报，出谋献策。结果从上千张大字报中发现，生铁质量之所以低，是由于矿粉压成球型烧结时没有经过洗选，含有大量泥沙杂质，因此含铁量低，含硫量高，可是，如果洗选矿粉，把其中的粘性泥土洗去，矿粉就压不成球，不能烧结。针对这个问题，职工们又提出了改进烧结矿粉的方法，使矿粉经过洗选以后，仍能烧结。
    工厂领导方面根据改革后的烧结方法和职工们提的其它意见，订出了一套原料管理制度。这个制度执行后，烧结矿粉含铁量由31.92％提高到51.37％，含硫量下降了60％，达到了富铁矿石的质量水平，并巩固了这一成绩。从而使小高炉全部用矿粉炼出了优质铁。
    生铁质量迅速上升了，但是产量增长幅度不快。领导方面就组织职工开展大攻小高炉“强风高温关”，来提高产量。在炉温提高、产量迅速上升以后，就根据攻关战役中的经验，订出了炉前、机房和布料等方面五十项操作规程和管理制度，以巩固成绩。
    这个厂今年以来连续发动了三次全厂性的攻关战役。为了巩固这三次战役取得的经验，保持战役中所达到的水平，全厂从采矿、洗煤炼焦、矿粉烧结等原料的生产管理，炉前操作、脱硫、化验，直到生铁的存放、出厂等二十六个主要生产环节，建立和健全了一套生产管理的岗位责任制度和技术操作规程，并通过开展群众性的竞赛和检查，使每个工人都认识到坚持制度的重要性，从而人人自觉地遵守制度，维护制度，保证了生产持续跃进。
