Lanzhou, August 29th (This newspaper) Gansu Province's small coal mine workers are carrying out a labor competition centered on "Five Improvements," continuously increasing labor productivity. From January to July, the province's small coal mines produced 30% more raw coal than the same period last year.

The content of the "Five Improvements" are: improving development methods; improving coal mining methods; improving tools and equipment, vigorously promoting indigenous mechanization; improving natural ventilation, improving working conditions; and improving ground transportation. In the labor competition centered on "Five Improvements," many small coal mines used indigenous machinery such as horse-drawn winches, canvas conveyors, wooden rail mine cars, hand drills, and indigenous mine lamps in the main production links such as coal mining, transportation, hoisting, ventilation, and drainage, greatly improving labor productivity. For example, the Shandong Dongshuiquan Coal Mine originally operated manually. After the "Five Improvements," the coal recovery rate quickly increased from 30% to more than 85%. By the end of July, it had completed 71% of the annual production plan, and its output increased more than twofold compared to the same period last year.

In the "Five Improvements" competition, small coal mines in various parts of Gansu conscientiously implemented the principles of making do with whatever is available, using local materials. For example, the Dahangou Coal Mine used local gypsum to make gypsum pillars, saving a large amount of pit wood. The Chalouhe Coal Mine relied on its own efforts to manufacture more than thirty kinds of indigenous machinery, totaling more than two hundred and sixty pieces, increasing work efficiency by twenty-seven times.

The leadership organs at all levels in Gansu Province attach great importance to the "Five Improvements" work of small coal mines. The Provincial Coal Industry Bureau established a headquarters, headed by the bureau director, and organized five working groups to go to the grassroots level to assist various places in carrying out the technical transformation of small coal mines.

    甘肃抓紧小煤矿全面技术改造工作
    以“五改”为中心开展竞赛
    本报兰州29日电　甘肃省各地小煤窑职工开展以“五改”为中心的劳动竞赛，不断提高劳动生产率。1月至7月，全省小煤窑所产的原煤比去年同期增加30％。
      “五改”的内容是：改进开拓方式；改进采煤方法；改进工具设备，大力推行土机械化；改进自然通风，改善劳动条件；改善地面运输。在以“五改”为中心的劳动竞赛中，许多小煤矿在采煤、运输、提升、通风、排水等主要生产环节上，使用了马拉绞车、帆布运输机、木轨矿车、手摇钻、土矿灯等土机械，大大提高了劳动生产率。如山丹东水泉煤矿原是手工操作，经过“五改”以后，煤的回采率迅速由过去的30％提高到85％以上，到7月底已完成全年生产计划的71％，产量比去年同期增长两倍多。
    甘肃各地小型煤矿在“五改”竞赛中，认真贯彻了因陋就简、就地取材的原则。如大黄沟煤矿利用当地的石膏，制成了石膏支柱，节省了大批坑木。岔路河煤矿自力更生，制成土机械三十多种二百六十多件，使工效提高二十七倍。
    甘肃省各级领导机关对小型煤矿的“五改”工作十分重视。省煤炭工业局成立了指挥部，由局长挂帅，并组织了五个工作组，到基层去协助各地开展小煤窑技术改造工作。
