Grasp Every Link with Both Hands, Strive for Initiative in Every Step
Pinglin Commune Improves Leadership Methods, Catches Up with Advanced Models

    (Our report) Wuhan - After the leading cadres of the Pinglin People's Commune in Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, went deep into the front line of production, they implemented a leadership method of "grasping every link with both hands and striving for initiative in every step," arranging production and labor, and overcoming the contradiction of "more land and less labor."

    The Pinglin Commune has an average of nearly fifteen mu of cultivated land per laborer. How can we improve production with so much cultivated land and such a tight labor force? Liu Yongqi, the county party committee's organization minister who was dispatched to the commune as party secretary, and other cadres, through production practice, realized that agricultural production has both strong seasonality and continuity between seasons. Therefore, they proposed the working method of grasping today and thinking about tomorrow, grasping the last season and thinking about the next season, and adhering to "grasping every link with both hands" and "striving for initiative in every step." The specific method is to first grasp the word "early," striving to arrange and start all farm work early. Last winter and this spring, during the large-scale water conservancy construction and this year's spring plowing, the commune first proposed the slogans "winter work for spring activities" and "spring work for summer activities." During the large-scale water conservancy construction in winter, the entire commune simultaneously carried out winter plowing and leveling of nearly 30,000 mu of winter fallow land. Before the "Grain Rain" solar term in the spring plowing season, the main force was invested in spring plowing and sowing, and at the same time, preparations for the wheat harvest were made in advance. Because of the early and skillful preparation for the wheat harvest, the time for reaping wheat in this commune this year was three days earlier than other communes. Although the area of wheat harvested in the entire commune this year was 13,000 mu larger than last year, the area of rice transplanting was 8,000 mu larger than last year, and the area of summer-sown miscellaneous grain crops was more than 20,000 mu larger than last year, they completed the tasks of rushing to harvest and rush to transplant half a month earlier than last year. The early wheat harvest and early rice transplanting brought about early wheat threshing, storage, and field management of autumn crops.

    When other communes were busy rushing to thresh wheat and rush to transplant mid-season rice, they had already overfulfilled the task of summer grain storage, and the first weeding and topdressing had been universally completed in 70,000 mu of rice paddies. When other communes finished threshing and transplanting and began to shift to autumn field management, their cultivation and management of rice and miscellaneous grain crops had already been carried out several times in succession.

    Recently, while continuing to focus on autumn field management with the main force, they also transferred 1,000 skilled plowmen, seizing the gap between summer harvest and summer planting and autumn harvest and autumn planting, to implement a combination of grazing cattle and reclaiming wasteland. By July 18, the entire commune had reclaimed 41,000 mu of wasteland, of which 4,000 mu had been planted with sesame and 7,000 mu had been planted with various late-season miscellaneous grain crops.

    In addition to "grasping every link with both hands" and rushing early in every step, the Pinglin Commune also paid close attention to agricultural capital construction and tool reform to solve the contradiction between multiple planting and multiple harvesting and the lack of labor. This commune is both a mountainous area and a paddy field area, with inconvenient transportation, and transportation and water lifting for irrigation consume a lot of labor. Last winter and this spring, they vigorously grasped water conservancy construction, expanding the area of self-flowing irrigation of paddy fields from 32,000 mu last year to 50,000 mu. At the same time, they vigorously carried out mountainous transportation construction, opening 170 new roads of various sizes, reducing the labor occupied by transportation. From the beginning of spring plowing to before the wheat harvest, the commune's industrial and commercial departments jointly formed a professional team for tool reform with various production teams, and manufactured and reformed various tools for cultivation, harvesting, transportation, and threshing on a large scale according to needs. Facts have proved that this has had an immediate effect on overcoming the excessive tension of labor during the busy farming season.

    The Pinglin Commune was originally the most backward commune in Zaoyang County in terms of agricultural production. This year, it has become the number one red flag commune in the county. The Zaoyang County Party Committee and the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee have decided to launch a "learn from Pinglin, catch up with Pinglin" campaign in the special zone.

### 环环两手抓　步步争主动  平林公社改进领导方法落后赶上先进

    环环两手抓　步步争主动
    平林公社改进领导方法落后赶上先进
    本报讯　湖北省枣阳县平林人民公社领导干部深入生产第一线以后，实行“环环两手抓，步步争主动”的领导方法，安排生产和劳动力，克服了“地多劳力少”的矛盾。
    平林公社平均每个劳动力负担将近十五亩耕地。耕地多、劳力紧张如何搞好生产？下放在这个公社担任党委书记的县委组织部长刘永歧和其他干部通过生产实践，认识到农业生产既有强烈的季节性，又有季节之间的连续性，因此提出了抓今天考虑明天，抓上一季却想下一季，坚持“环环两手抓”“步步争主动”的工作方法。具体作法是首先抓“早”字，一切农活争取早安排，早动手。去冬今春大兴水利建设和今年春耕中，这个公社就先提出了“春活冬干”和“夏活春干”的口号。在冬季大搞水利建设中，全社同时把近三万亩冬闲田进行了隔冬翻耕和平整好；春耕“谷雨”前，把主要力量投入春耕春播工作，同时又把麦收准备工作提前作好安排。由于麦收准备早，安排巧，这个公社今年开镰割麦的时间，比其他公社提早了三天，尽管全公社今年麦收的面积比去年扩大了一万三千亩，水稻插秧面积比去年扩大了八千亩，夏种杂粮作物面积比去年扩大了二万多亩，但是却比去年提早半个月完成了抢收抢插任务。麦收的早，秧插的早，又带来了小麦打场、入库和秋季作物田间管理步步先行。
    当其他公社忙着抢打小麦、抢插中稻，他们已经超额完成夏粮入库任务，七万亩稻田也已普遍作完第一次薅草和追肥；当其他公社打完场、插完秧，开始转入秋田管理时，他们的水稻和杂粮作物的培育管理工作已经接二连三地干过几遍了。
    最近，他们一面以主要力量继续抓好秋田管理工作，一面又抽调出一千名使犁能手，抓住耕牛在夏收夏种后到秋收秋种前的空隙时间，实行耕牛放牧与开荒相结合的办法，到7月18日全社已开荒四万一千亩，其中四千亩已种上了芝麻，七千亩种上了各种晚季杂粮作物。
    平林公社解决多种多收和劳力缺乏的矛盾，除了“环环两手抓”步步赶早以外，对于农业基本建设和工具改革，也抓得很紧。这个公社既是山区又是水田区，交通不便，运输和提水灌溉占用劳动力很多。去冬今春，他们狠抓水利建设，使水田自流灌溉面积由去年的三万二千亩扩大到了五万亩；同时大搞山区交通建设，新开大小道路一百七十条，减少了运输占用的劳力。从春耕开始到麦收前，又以公社工商部门为主联合各生产队共同组成工具改革的专业班子，根据需要大规模地制造和改革耕作、收割、运输、脱粒等各项工具。事实证明，这对克服农忙中劳动力过分紧张，起了立竿见影的效果。
    平林公社在农业生产上，原来是枣阳县最落后的公社，今年一跃成为全县第一名红旗公社。枣阳县委、襄阳地委已决定在专区掀起“学平林、赶平林”的运动。
