Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 11th. Gansu Province, with a forward-looking spirit, is seizing the summer harvest, summer planting, and drought resistance to protect the autumn harvest, while also vigorously engaging in summer plowing to lay a solid foundation for the continued great leap forward in agriculture next year.

Gansu Province is located on the high plateaus of Northwest China, with a dry climate, scarce rainfall, and relatively poor soil fertility. According to the masses' years of production practice and the agricultural scientific research departments' investigations, large-scale summer plowing can utilize the high summer temperatures and strong sunlight to promote soil weathering, release soil fertility, and greatly improve water absorption, soil moisture retention, fertilizer efficiency, weed control, and pest control. Generally, land plowed in the summer can yield about 16% more than land plowed in the autumn. Therefore, the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee requires local Party organizations and people's communes to take the concentrated summer plowing as an important measure to win a continued bumper harvest in agriculture next year, and strive for more plowing, faster plowing, and better plowing. The people of the whole province immediately responded to this call of the Provincial Party Committee and launched a summer plowing upsurge.

Adequate preparation, early action, and tight grasp are the significant characteristics of this year's summer plowing in the province. The Party committees at all levels arranged summer plowing while arranging summer harvesting and planting, leading the people's communes to prepare tools early, organize summer plowing teams, and seize the opportunity to achieve "hot stubble" summer plowing. In addition to stepping up the rush repair of tractors and other large agricultural machinery, all parts of the province have prepared more than 274,400 summer plowing farm tools, including more than 91,540 improved deep plows. As of the end of July, the summer stubble land plowed in the province has reached more than 3,761,200 mu. In the Pingliang area, where the season is early, more than 2,085,000 mu of summer stubble land has completed the first summer plowing.

Combining summer plowing with large-scale land leveling and actively transforming low-yield fields is another characteristic of summer plowing in various places this year. With the help of the Provincial Science and Technology Commission and the Provincial Department of Agriculture, Qingyang County, focusing on the Dongzhi and Xifeng communes, planned more than 900,000 mu of cultivated land in six communes of Dongzhiyuan according to the standards of garden-style farmland, and carried out leveling work in conjunction with summer plowing, reasonably adjusting field roads and field canal systems to prepare for large-scale high-yield plots next year. The people's communes in the Longdong, Longnan, and central arid regions also adopted measures such as deep plowing, fertilization, planting green manure and fast-growing green manure, and soil disinfection to vigorously transform low-yield fields. By mid-July, the Tianshui and Pingliang areas had newly planted more than 710,000 mu of sweet clover, which can fertilize the fields.

    提早动手为明年丰收打好基础
    甘肃全省动员改秋耕为伏耕
    结合伏耕大面积平整土地大力改造低产田
    新华社兰州11日电　甘肃省用上步看下步的精神，在抓紧夏收、夏种和抗旱保秋的同时，大抓伏天耕地，为明年农业继续大跃进打好基础。
    甘肃省地处西北高塬，气候干燥，雨量稀少，土壤肥力较差。根据群众多年来的生产实践和农业科学研究部门的调查证明：大搞伏耕，可以利用夏季气温高、日照强等因素，促进土壤风化，释放土壤肥力，对接纳雨水、提高土壤保水、保肥效能和灭草、杀虫等有很大作用；一般在伏天耕过的土地比在秋天耕过的土地约可增产16％以上。因此，中共甘肃省委要求各地党组织和人民公社把突击伏天耕地作为夺取明年农业继续大丰收的重要措施，力争多耕、快耕、耕好。全省人民立即响应省委这一号召，掀起伏耕热潮。
    准备充分，动手早，抓的紧，是今年全省伏耕的显著特点。各级党委早在安排夏收夏种工作的同时，安排了伏耕，领导各人民公社提早准备工具，组织伏耕队伍，抓紧时机做到“热茬”伏耕。全省各地除加紧抢修拖拉机等大型农业机械外，还准备了二十七万四千四百多部伏耕农具，其中有改良深耕犁九万一千五百四十多部。截至7月底的统计，全省伏耕的夏茬地已达三百七十六万一千二百多亩。季节早的平凉专区已有二百零八万五千多亩夏茬地完成了头遍伏耕。
    结合伏耕大面积平整土地，积极改造低产田，是今年各地进行伏耕的另一特点。庆阳县在省科技委、省农业厅的帮助下，以董志、西峰两个公社为重点，对董志塬六个公社的九十多万亩耕地，按园田化的标准进行规划，结合伏耕展开了整平工作，合理调整田间道路和田间渠系，为明年大搞丰产方作好准备。陇东、陇南和中部干旱地区的各人民公社，还采取深耕、施肥、种绿肥和速生绿肥及进行土壤消毒等办法，大力改造低产田。天水、平凉两个专区到7月中旬，已新种可以肥田的草木樨七十一万多亩。
