The recent new upsurge in the Italian people's struggle has shattered the myth of so-called "peace" in Europe. The raging mass movement, burning from the Alps to Sicily, spreading from towns to villages, swept across the entire Italian peninsula, violently impacting the rule of the Italian reactionary groups.

(I)
The recent struggles of the Italian people have mainly revolved around opposing the resurgence of fascist forces and demanding the improvement of labor and living conditions. On April 25th, the Anti-Fascist Day was held throughout the country; from the end of June to the beginning of July, more than 200,000 people in Genoa were involved in the anti-fascist struggle, opposing the decision of the new fascist party to hold a congress in the city. The just actions of the people of Genoa received enthusiastic response and support from people all over Italy. Turin, Florence, Bologna, Naples and other cities held anti-fascist demonstrations. The people's struggle finally forced the new fascist party to cancel the congress in Genoa. On July 6th, a mass anti-fascist demonstration of ten thousand people was held in Rome. On July 9th, in the industrial center of Reggio Emilia, more than 150,000 people attended the funeral of five anti-fascist martyrs, protesting the reactionary government's massacre of demonstrators. The national general strike on July 8th, called by the Italian Communist Party and the Italian General Confederation of Labor, brought the movement to a climax. Resistance movement joint committees have been established in towns and cities of all sizes in Italy, determined to carry on the anti-fascist struggle.

At the same time, the struggle of the working people to improve their living conditions continued to rise. Since the beginning of this year, there have been continuous strikes, which were even more frequent in June and July. General strikes were held by workers in various cities and industries one after another. Millions of agricultural workers and hundreds of thousands of sharecroppers have repeatedly carried out strike struggles separately. Under the impact of the people's powerful struggle, the reactionary Tamburroni government, which had only been established for three months, finally collapsed on July 19th.

The struggle of the Italian people has shown significant development since the beginning of this year. The scale of the struggle is getting bigger and bigger, the strata participating in the struggle is becoming more and more extensive, and the struggle is becoming more and more politically charged.

The number of workers participating in strikes in the first half of this year greatly exceeded that of previous years. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 6 million people participated in strikes during this period, more than double the same period in 1959, when the strike movement was high. From January to June, there were as many as ten strikes involving between 10,000 and 200,000 people in the cities. The mass anti-fascist demonstration of ten thousand people in Rome and the mass anti-fascist rally of one hundred thousand people in Milan were unprecedented in scale. Those who have joined the struggle are not only workers and suffering peasants. Many intellectuals, students, handicraftsmen, merchants, and the middle class have also participated in the struggle. The breadth of the people's struggle is also reflected in the fact that the mass movement has spread to every corner of Italy, from advanced big cities to backward rural areas, from modern factories to handicraft workshops, all setting off a wave of struggle.

More importantly, the recent mass movement in Italy is being carried out with economic and political struggles intertwined. The Italian people are increasingly clear that in order to improve living and working conditions, they must resolutely oppose the reactionary policies of the ruling group that create disasters for the people.

(II)
The vigorous development of the Italian people's struggle shows that social and class contradictions in Italy are becoming increasingly acute.

For many years, the Italian government has been following the United States in expanding its arms and preparing for war, and the burden on the people has been increasing. From 1953 to 1960, military spending increased from 520 billion lire to 674 billion lire, and this year it increased by 60 billion lire compared to last year. People's lives are deteriorating. With the help of the reactionary government, the exploitation of workers by monopoly capitalists has been sharply intensified. In recent years, capitalists have adopted new technologies and generally implemented automation. The labor intensity of workers has greatly increased, but workers' wages have not only failed to increase with the growth of production, but have also been laid off in large numbers. The profits of capitalists have risen sharply, while the impoverishment of the working class has deepened. From 1956 to 1959, workers' wages increased by only 5%, while capitalists' profits increased by 19% in just one year from 1958 to 1959. Capitalists also try to use the wage differences between enterprises, between men and women, and between adults and teenagers to seize profits. The existence of a large number of unemployed workers (for many years, the unemployed population in Italy has maintained a record of two million) has also been used by capitalists to undermine contracts, lower the wages of employed workers, and strengthen the conditions for exploitation. The situation in rural areas is even worse. The rural unemployed population amounts to several million. Especially after the entry into force of the Western European Common Market, about 300,000 farmers migrate to cities and foreign countries every year due to the need to change planting policies. Recently, the Italian government has also formulated a so-called agricultural development plan, which stipulates an investment of 550 billion lire in five years, which is essentially just using the money squeezed from the working people to further facilitate monopoly capital and big landlords to plunder more of the people's wealth.

Not only that, because the Italian ruling group follows the war policy of the United States and provides its territory to the United States to build missile bases, Italy has become a war target. In addition to the threat to their lives, the Italian people are also threatened with security. Therefore, the movement of the people demanding democratic reforms and opposing US military bases is quite high. Under such circumstances, the Italian ruling group not only turned a deaf ear to the voices of the people, but also strengthened its reactionary rule. The Christian Democratic government openly colluded with the new fascist party and condoned the revival of fascist forces. Therefore, fascist elements are becoming increasingly rampant in Italy. The head of the new fascist party openly declared: "If another Mussolini comes out, we may follow him." This party even attempted to show its strength by convening a party congress. Italy, which has suffered deeply from fascism, is once again in serious danger of fascist restoration.

(III)
Such actions by the Italian ruling group cannot but arouse increasingly strong dissatisfaction and opposition from the broad masses of the people. In order to extinguish the flames of anger of the masses, the Italian reactionary government adopted brutal and despicable means. The Italian government has continuously carried out bloody suppression of striking and demonstrating masses, creating many bloody incidents. Even bourgeois newspapers admit that the class struggle situation in early July was more tense than in 1948 and 1950. While carrying out violent suppression, the Italian ruling group also used deception and bribery in an attempt to split the united action of the labor movement. The first is to undermine the cooperation between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party in the General Confederation of Labor, and the second is to isolate the General Confederation of Labor. The capitalists of many factories have signed contracts separately with the Christian Democratic Labor Union and the Social Democratic Labor Union to undermine the unity within the workers. On the one hand, capitalists make certain concessions to some economic strikes, while at the same time retaliating against the masses participating in the struggle, threatening them with dismissal, suspension of work, and even court trials.

However, no matter what means the ruling group takes, it has repeatedly failed. The Italian government's violent suppression of this anti-fascist movement not only failed to stop the development of the movement, but instead aroused a new upsurge in the national anti-fascist movement. Due to the increasingly acute class struggle and the growing strength of progressive forces, the contradictions within the Italian ruling group are intensifying, and they have differences in their strategies for dealing with the mass movement. A group of people in the ruling group attempted to take advantage of some people's superstition in the church, and the Speaker of the Upper House proposed a "political truce" of fifteen days. During this period, political strikes were suspended, and the military police were not dispatched, while the current political situation was debated in Parliament. The purpose of this conspiracy was to win over and divide those who were not firm enough standing on the side of the anti-fascist struggle, so as to isolate the Italian Communist Party and prevent or undermine the mass movement.

Wherever there is class exploitation and oppression, there is the people's struggle of resistance. This is an objective law that no force can change. The reactionary ruling class always hopes to use a policy of high pressure to curb the struggle of the masses, but the result can only be counterproductive, and will inevitably promote the masses to rise up more resolutely to resist. The upsurge of the Italian people's struggle once again proves this truth. (Attached picture)

    意大利人民斗争的新高涨	史维德
    最近意大利人民斗争的新高涨，打破了所谓欧洲“平静”的神话。如火如荼的群众运动从阿尔卑斯山燃烧到西西里岛，从城镇蔓延到乡村，席卷了整个意大利半岛，剧烈地冲击着意大利反动集团的统治。
            （一）
    意大利人民最近的斗争主要是围绕着反对法西斯势力复僻和要求改善劳动和生活条件这样一些目标展开的。4月25日，在全国各地举行了反法西斯日；从6月底到7月初，热那亚有二十多万人投入了反法西斯斗争，反对新法西斯党决定在该城市举行代表大会。热那亚人民的正义行动受到意大利各地人民的热烈响应和支持。都灵、佛罗伦萨、波伦亚、那不勒斯等城市都纷纷举行了反法西斯示威游行。人民的斗争终于迫使新法西斯党取消了在热那亚举行的代表大会，在7月6日，罗马又举行了万人的反法西斯大示威。7月9日在工业中心勒佐—艾米里亚有十五万人以上参加了五个反法西斯烈士的葬礼，抗议反动政府屠杀示威者。7月8日在意大利共产党和意大利总工会号召下举行的全国总罢工，使运动达到了高潮。意大利的大大小小城镇中，都纷纷成立了抵抗运动联合委员会，决心把反法西斯斗争坚持下去。
    与此同时，劳动人民要求改善生活条件的斗争也继续高涨。今年以来就连绵不断的罢工，6、7月份更是频繁，各个城镇、各个行业的工人举行的总罢工此起彼伏。数以百万计的农业工人和数十万对分佃农也一再分别进行了罢工斗争。在人民强大斗争的冲击下，成立只有三个月的塔姆布罗尼反动政府，终于在7月19日倒台。
    意大利人民的斗争，从今年以来就有了比较显著的发展。斗争的规模越来越大，参加斗争的阶层越来越广泛，而且斗争越来越具有强烈的政治色彩。
    今年上半年参加罢工的工人，大大超过了以往几年。据不完全统计，在此期间参加罢工的共达六百万人次，比罢工运动高涨的1959年同期超过一倍以上。从1月到6月，在城市中从一万人到二十万人的罢工达十起之多。在罗马举行的万人反法西斯大示威和在米兰举行的十万人反法西斯集会，规模之大是过去所少见的。投入到斗争行列的已经不只是工人和受苦的农民。许多知识分子、学生、手工业者、商人以及中产阶级也都参加了斗争。人民斗争的广泛性还表现在群众运动已扩展到意大利的各个角落，从先进的大城市到落后的农村，从现代化的工厂到手工业作坊，都掀起了斗争的浪潮。
    更重要的是，意大利最近的群众运动，是以经济斗争和政治斗争互相交错而进行的。意大利人民越来越清楚，要想改善生活和劳动条件，必须坚决反对统治集团给人民制造灾难的反动政策。
            （二）
    意大利人民斗争的蓬勃发展，表明意大利社会矛盾和阶级矛盾日益尖锐化。
    多年以来意大利政府一直追随美国进行扩军备战，人民的负担日益加重。从1953年到1960年，军费由五千二百亿里拉增加到六千七百四十亿里拉，而今年就比去年增加了六百亿里拉。人民生活日益恶化。在反动政府的帮助下，垄断资本家对工人的剥削急剧加强。近年来，资本家采取了新技术，普遍实行自动化，工人的劳动强度大大增加，但是工人的工资不但未随生产的增长而增长，反而遭到成批解雇。资本家的利润急剧上升，而工人阶级的贫困化日益加深。从1956年到1959年，工人的工资只增加了5％，资本家的利润却从1958年到1959年一年中就增加了19％。资本家还尽量利用企业之间、男女之间、成年与少年之间存在的工资差别来攫取利润。而大量失业工人的存在，（多年来意大利失业人口一直保持着二百万的纪录）也被资本家利用来破坏合同、压低在业工人工资和加强剥削的条件。农村中的状况更糟。农村失业人口达几百万之多，特别是在西欧共同市场生效后，由于要改变种植方针，每年有三十万左右农民流到城市和国外。最近意大利政府又拟定了一个所谓发展农业的计划，规定五年内投资五千五百亿里拉，实质上只不过是利用从劳动人民身上搜刮来的钱，来进一步方便垄断资本与大地主掠夺更多的民脂民膏而已。
    不仅如此，由于意大利统治集团追随美国的战争政策，把本国领土供给美国建立导弹基地，使意大利成为了战争靶子，意大利人民在生活的威胁之外还受到安全的威胁。因此人民要求进行民主改革、反对美国军事基地的运动相当高涨。在这种情况下，意大利统治集团不但对人民的呼声置若罔闻，而且加强反动统治。天主教民主党政府公开同新法西斯党勾结，纵容法西斯势力复活。因此，法西斯分子在意大利日益猖獗，新法西斯党的头目公然宣称：“假如有另一个墨索里尼出来，我们也许将追随他”。这个党甚至企图想以召开党代表大会来显示它的力量。曾经深受法西斯祸害的意大利，又处在法西斯复辟的严重危险之中。
          （三）
    意大利统治集团的这种行径，自然不能不引起广大人民群众日益强烈的不满和反对。意大利反动政府为了扑灭人民群众的怒火，却采取了残暴和卑鄙手段。意大利政府对罢工与示威群众不断进行血腥镇压，制造了多次的流血事件。甚至连资产阶级的报纸也承认7月上旬的阶级斗争形势比1948年和1950年都要紧张。意大利统治集团在进行暴力镇压的同时，还兼施欺骗、收买手段，妄图分裂工人运动的统一行动。首先是破坏共产党与社会党在总工会中的合作，其次是孤立总工会。许多工厂的资本家就单独与天主教民主党工会、社会民主党工会签订合同来破坏工人内部的团结。资本家一方面对一些经济罢工作出某种让步，同时又对参加斗争的群众进行报复，以解雇、停止工作，甚至法庭审讯来进行威胁。
    但是，统治集团不管采取哪种手段，都一再遭到了失败。意大利政府对这次反法西斯运动进行暴力镇压，结果不仅未能阻止运动的发展，反而激起了全民反法西斯运动的新高涨。由于阶级斗争日益尖锐和进步力量日益壮大，意大利统治集团内部的矛盾在加剧，他们在对待人民群众运动的策略上产生了分歧。统治集团中的一伙人企图利用某些人对教会的迷信，由上院议长提出“政治休战”十五天的建议。在此时间内停止政治罢工，军警也不出动，而在议会中辩论当前政治局势。这一阴谋的目的在于拉拢分化站在反法西斯斗争一边的不够坚定的分子，以便孤立意大利共产党，使群众运动遭到阻止或破坏。
    哪里有阶级剥削和压迫，哪里就有人民的反抗斗争。这是任何力量都无法改变的客观规律。反动的统治阶级总是希图使用高压政策来遏止人民群众的斗争，结果只能适得其反，必然促使人民群众更坚决地起来反抗。意大利人民斗争的高涨，再一次证明了这一真理。（附图片）
