    Plateau Transportation with Trailers
    Zhou Zuoyin and Li Bingnan, drivers of the No. 3 Team of the Tibet Transportation Bureau, persisted in using trailer transport on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, breaking the claim that trailer transport could not be implemented on the Tibetan Plateau, and created a new record of over 40,000 ton-kilometers per vehicle-ton-month on the Tibetan Plateau.
    Zhou Zuoyin attended the National Congress of Heroes last year for his outstanding achievement of completing the transportation task ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota. This year, he insisted on attaching a trailer to his Jiefang brand truck and completed the annual transportation task ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota by the end of May, saving the country 2,603 liters of gasoline.
    Li Bingnan, who first created a record of 10,000 ton-kilometers per vehicle-ton-month on the Tibetan Plateau, also insisted on attaching a trailer to the ZIS truck he drove this year. By the end of May, he had completed the annual task ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota, while also saving the country 1,075 liters of gasoline.

    高原运输挂拖斗
    西藏运输局汽车三队驾驶员周祚胤和李炳南，在青藏公路上坚持实行拖挂运输，打破了西藏高原不能实行挂拖斗运输的说法，创造了西藏高原车吨月产四万多吨公里的新纪录。
    周祚胤去年曾以提前超额完成运输任务的出色成绩出席了全国群英会。今年，他在解放牌汽车上坚持挂一个拖车，到五月底就提前超额完成了全年运输任务，并为国家节约汽油两千六百零三公升。
    在西藏高原首创车吨月产万吨公里纪录的李炳南，今年也坚持在他驾驶的吉斯车上挂一个拖车。到五月底，他就提前超额完成了全年任务，同时为国家节约了一千零七十五公升汽油。
