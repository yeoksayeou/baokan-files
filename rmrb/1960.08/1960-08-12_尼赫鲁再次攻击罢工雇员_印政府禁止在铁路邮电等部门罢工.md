Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 10th: According to the Indian Information Service, Prime Minister Nehru, while debating the recent strike by central government employees in the Indian People's Assembly on the 9th, once again attacked the strike as being "so vicious and so foolish," and "a bad thing."

He admitted that the strike occurred because of the rising price index. But he also said that no matter what caused the strike, it was a wrong thing and a "very irresponsible thing."

Nehru said he agreed with the opinion expressed by Home Minister Pant in the People's Assembly the day before, that the government should ban strikes in important departments such as railways, post and telecommunications.

The People's Assembly, with an absolute majority of Congress Party members, had already rejected on the 9th, by a majority vote, the proposal opposing the decree prohibiting strikes in important service departments, and agreed with the Nehru government's position and actions regarding the recent employee strike incident.

    尼赫鲁再次攻击罢工雇员
    印政府禁止在铁路邮电等部门罢工
    新华社10日讯　新德里消息：据印度新闻处报道，尼赫鲁总理9日在印度人民院就中央政府雇员最近举行的罢工问题进行辩论时，再次攻击这次罢工是“如此恶毒和如此愚蠢”，是“一件坏事”。
    他承认，这次罢工之所以发生，是由于物价指数上升。但是他又说，不管引起罢工的原因是什么，总之罢工是件错误的事情和“非常不负责任的事情”。
    尼赫鲁说，他同意内政部长潘特前一天在人民院发表的意见，即政府禁止在铁路、邮电等重要部门举行罢工。
    人民院在国大党议员占绝对优势的情况下，已经在9日以多数票否决了反对禁止在重要服务部门罢工的法令的提案，同意尼赫鲁政府对最近雇员罢工事件所采取的立场和行动。
