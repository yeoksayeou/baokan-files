America's War Hysteria

“A Nation Surrounded”

The British "Daily Herald's" Washington correspondent said in a dispatch on August 15 that the United States is currently like "a nation surrounded," "where no one talks about disarmament, but only about more and more deadly weapons... nine out of ten news items in newspapers, radio and television broadcasts are about the Cold War... wherever I go, there are always bombers, missile bases or large armories nearby.”

In Washington, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve System have secretly stored large amounts of currency in "scattered and reliable vaults" to prepare for nuclear war. The Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization is building underground structures capable of shielding from radiation, located one hundred to one hundred and fifty miles from Washington. At the same time, the Strategic Air Command has begun to disperse bombers to civilian airports. On August 17, Defense Secretary Gates announced the establishment of a central military planning agency for operations against the Soviet Union, led by Strategic Air Command Commander General Power. Gates said this was "the most important decision I have participated in since becoming Secretary of Defense."

In New York State, Governor Rockefeller is advocating the establishment of food banks to prepare for war. Lance Industries, the largest manufacturer of small fiberglass swimming pools in the United States, is vigorously promoting small atomic shelters costing $1,500 each. The chairman of the New York State Civil Defense Commission personally went out to promote sales. The "New York Post" pointed out in a short commentary on August 5 that Lance Industries has a subsidiary called "Thiokol Chemical Corporation," which "designs and manufactures parts needed for American missiles." Creating an atmosphere of war terror, selling missiles on the one hand, and selling atomic shelters on the other, is Lance Industries' way to make money.

Missile Mania

Under the policy of intensified arms expansion and war preparation by the American ruling authorities, the production and development of missiles in the United States has reached a feverish level.

On July 29, Defense Secretary Gates convened a secret meeting of missile construction and industry leaders, expressing his intention to suppress missile workers' strikes and accelerate missile manufacturing. On August 1, a large-scale secret conference on missile research and development was held in San Diego, California. More than two thousand senior military and civilian missile engineers and "scientists" attended the meeting. American news agencies proclaimed that this conference was one of the most important meetings held in the United States this year. Eisenhower submitted a special message to Congress on August 8 advocating arms expansion and war preparation, declaring that he had "directed the trial production of a Polaris missile with a much longer range."

Intensified Preparation for Biological and Chemical Warfare

While vigorously developing missiles, the American military authorities are also stepping up the production of chemical and bacteriological weapons aimed at the mass slaughter of peaceful residents. The Biological Warfare Research Institute outside Washington, the Chemical Materiel Headquarters in Maryland, and the arsenal near Denver are all producing such weapons.

The United States spends $40 million annually on research into chemical and bacteriological weapons, and it plans to increase this funding to more than $120 million annually within two or three years. According to information disclosed earlier by Congressman Kastenmeier in Congress, since 1950, more than 700 people in the United States have become ill or died in research on chemical and bacteriological weapons.

Under the direction of chemical and military-industrial monopolists, the American military authorities have launched a chemical and bacteriological warfare propaganda campaign. "The New York Post" said in an editorial, "The Army has launched a campaign to promote bacteriological and chemical warfare, especially to those who are unwilling to spend more money on expensive items such as nuclear bombs." The "New York Post" said that the Army believes that "after carrying out bacteriological and gas warfare, an offensive can be launched immediately," which is "cheap, simple, broad in scope, and can kill more people than bombs."

"Exercises" to Incite War Hysteria

After the United States sabotaged the summit conference, it continued to hold various "exercises" to incite war hysteria at home. During the large-scale "civil defense exercise" in early May, 566 television stations across the country stopped working, and 4,335 radio stations either stopped broadcasting or participated in broadcasting alarm signals. In New York, more than a thousand citizens held rallies to protest the creation of war hysteria, and police arrested 26 men and women.

In June, the American authorities continued to hold "exercises" across the country. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, twenty-nine American citizens were driven into a small hole said to be shielded from nuclear weapons damage for "testing." Among the twenty-nine people used as "test animals" were children as young as seven and elderly people as old as seventy-two. They had to stay in the hole for two weeks. Their diet was restricted in the hole. A "civil defense exercise" was also held in Burlington, New Jersey. All three hundred households in the small town were forced to leave their homes and spend two nights in a nearby forest.

In order to intensify the creation of a war atmosphere, the American authorities recently announced that they will hold a large-scale air force exercise on September 10, during which all domestic and foreign civil aviation aircraft will be prohibited from flying over the United States. According to Western news agencies, this is the first time that civil aviation flights have been banned during peacetime. The American military authorities also began a two-week-long air transport combat exercise on the east coast of the United States on August 20, the largest since World War II.

### 美国的战争歇斯底里

    美国的战争歇斯底里
    “一个陷入了重围的国家”
    英国“每日先驱报”驻华盛顿记者在8月15日的一篇通讯报道中说，美国目前的情况仿佛是“一个陷入了重围的国家”，“那里没有人谈裁军，而只谈更多和更致命的武器……，报纸、电台和电视广播中的消息十分之九是关于冷战的事……，我到的地方，附近总少不了有轰炸机、导弹基地或者大的兵工厂”。
    在华盛顿，财政部和联邦储备系统已经在“分散的和可靠的地穴内”秘密储存了大量货币为核战争作准备，民间和国防动员署，在距离华盛顿一百到一百五十哩的地方大盖能避放射性的地下建筑。同时，战略空军司令部已经开始把轰炸机分散到民间机场。8月17日，国防部长盖茨宣布成立一个对苏作战的中央军事计划机构，由战略空军司令部司令鲍威尔领导。盖茨说，这是自从他就任国防部长以来“所曾参加作出的最重要的决定”。
    在纽约州，洛克菲勒州长鼓吹成立粮食银行以准备战争。美国最大的生产玻璃纤维制小型游泳池的兰塞工业公司，正在大力推销费用为一千五百美元一所的小型原子避难所。纽约州民防委员会主席亲自出动劝销。“纽约邮报”8月5日在一篇短评中指出，兰塞公司有一家名叫“导弹动力公司”的分支机构，“导弹动力公司”“设计、制造美国导弹所需要的零件”。制造战争恐怖气氛，一手推销导弹，一手推销原子避难所，就是兰塞公司的生财之道。
    导弹狂
    在美国统治当局加紧推行扩军备战的政策下，美国的导弹生产和发展达到了狂热的程度。
    7月29日，国防部长盖茨召集了导弹建筑和工业领袖们举行了一次秘密会议，表示要镇压导弹工人的罢工、加速导弹制造。8月1日，在加利福尼亚州的圣地亚哥，举行了一次大规模的研究发展导弹的秘密会议，参加会议的有两千多名高级军职和文职的导弹工程人员和“科学家”，美国的通讯社宣扬这次会议是美国今年举行的最重要的会议之一。艾森豪威尔在8月8日向国会提出鼓吹扩军备战的特别咨文，宣称他已“指示试制一种射程更远得多的北极星式导弹”。
    加紧准备生物和化学战争
    在大力发展导弹的同时，美国军事当局还在加紧制造以大规模屠杀和平居民为目的的化学和细菌武器。华盛顿郊外的生物战争研究所、马里兰州化学特遣总部和丹佛城附近的兵工厂都在生产这种武器。
    美国每年用在研究化学和细菌武器方面的开支达四千万美元，它打算在两三年以内把这种经费增加到每年一亿二千万美元以上。据早些时候，众议员卡斯滕迈尔在国会透露的消息，自从1950年以来，美国在研究化学和细菌武器中得病或死亡的已达七百多人。
    在化学、军火垄断资本家的指使下，美国军事当局已经进行了一个化学战、细菌战宣传运动。“纽约邮报”在一篇社论里说，“陆军展开了一个宣传细菌战和化学战的运动，特别是向那些不愿意在核弹等耗钱多的东西上花更多钱的人进行宣传。”“纽约邮报”说，陆军方面认为“在进行细菌战和毒气战以后，可以立即举行进攻”，这种方法“便宜、简单、范围广，而且比炸弹能杀死更多的人”。
    煽动战争歇斯底里的“演习”
    美国破坏首脑会议以后，继续不断地在国内举行各式各样的煽动战争歇斯底里的“演习”。5月初的大规模“民防演习”中，全国五百六十六个电视广播台停止了工作，四千三百三十五个无线电广播台有的停止了广播、有的参加播送警报信号。在纽约，一千多名市民举行集会抗议制造战争歇斯底里，警察为此逮捕了二十六名男女市民。
    6月，美国当局继续在全国各地举行“演习”。在宾夕法尼亚州的匹兹堡，二十九名美国公民被驱进一个所谓防避核武器伤害的小洞里进行“试验”。二十九个作为“试验动物”的人中，有七岁的小孩，也有七十二岁的老人，他们要在洞里停留两个星期。在洞里，他们的饮食受到了限制。在新泽西州的柏林敦，也举行了一次“民防演习”。这个小城的全部三百户人家被迫离家，到附近森林里去度过两个晚上。
    为了加紧制造战争气氛，美国当局最近宣布，将在9月10日举行一次大规模的空军演习，届时将禁止一切本国和外国的民航飞机在美国上空飞行。据西方通讯社说，在和平时期，禁止民航飞行，这还是第一次。美国军事当局还从8月20日起开始在美国东海岸举行为期两周的、第二次世界大战以来规模最大的一次空运作战演习。
