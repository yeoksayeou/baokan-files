    Help

    In the process of implementing the "Two-Five System," cadres at the county, people's commune, and management district levels go deep into the front lines of production, to the production teams, to take full responsibility for production, life, and ideological work there. This is cadre responsibility for teams.

    How should we work to be fully responsible for the tasks of a production team? Not by doing it alone, but by helping the grassroots cadres. Help the grassroots cadres come up with ideas and methods, improve the work system, and help them improve their leadership skills, work style, and work methods. That is to say, help them correctly implement the Party's policies, improve their ability to analyze problems, learn to follow the mass line, and launch large-scale mass movements. In this way, things will be done more, faster, and better. Grassroots cadres have been diligently working and laboring in their localities for many years, and they understand the production, the lives, and the ideological situation of the teams they are responsible for. They are generally trusted and loved by the masses, and they have many brilliant ideas and methods in their work. Cadres who go down should be good at being "talent scouts," discovering their good working methods, helping them improve, establishing necessary work systems, and helping them summarize and improve good ideas and methods, and widely disseminate them. At the same time, they should help and inspire the enthusiasm and creativity of grassroots cadres, let them solve various problems themselves, and improve the political and ideological level and working ability of grassroots cadres through practical work. In this way, when the team-responsible cadres are here, the work here is advanced, and once the team-responsible cadres leave, the work here will still be advanced. This can be considered to have achieved the purpose of "help."

    Some team-responsible cadres are enthusiastic and active. Seeing that there is a lot of work in the team and the tasks are heavy, they often take on many things and do them themselves. As a result, the cadres who go down are extremely busy, while the grassroots cadres there have little to do, which suppresses their enthusiasm and creativity. These cadres who go deep into the grassroots are enthusiastic in their work, not afraid of difficulties and hardships, and are wholeheartedly trying to change the backwardness there in a short period of time. This wish is naturally excellent. However, if they only work alone, without mobilizing and relying on the grassroots cadres and the masses there, it will be counterproductive. These cadres may also achieve some results, and even make the work of the production team rank among the top, but these achievements are not solid. Moreover, in today's situation, the work of a production team is quite complex, requiring attention to both political ideology and production and life; in terms of production, in addition to agriculture, there are also forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. With so much work, no matter how great one person's ability is, they cannot handle it all. In the end, they still have to rely on the grassroots cadres and the masses to do it themselves to get things done well.

    Of course, not taking over everything does not mean pushing things away and not taking care of them. Cadres who go down should participate in leadership work and be responsible for a part of the work. For the work they are responsible for, they should help the grassroots cadres through their own exemplary actions. In some cases, grassroots cadres and the masses encounter difficulties that they cannot solve themselves. They bring the problems forward, urgently needing someone to make a decisive decision and set an example. The cadres who go down should not push back, but should stand up, come up with their own ideas and methods, and personally set an example. Is this taking over everything? No. It should be said that this is also a way of helping, helping with practical actions, helping by doing. This kind of help will not only not alienate the masses, but will also be approved by the grassroots cadres and the masses, and will produce good results.

    To "help" well, one must also "do" well, "transform" well, and "learn" well, first becoming an ordinary worker, understanding both the experiences of points and grasping the situation of the whole, learning from both grassroots cadres and the masses. On this basis, the ideas put forward and the methods thought out can conform to the objective reality of the time and place, and can truly and timely solve specific problems. In this way, the cadres who go down can better bring the Party's realistic work style, and the fine tradition of the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses," to the grassroots work, which will be of great inspiration and help to the grassroots cadres and the masses. This kind of "help" is solid and most concrete.

    在推行“二五制”过程中，县、人民公社、管理区各级干部，深入到生产第一线，生产小队去，对那里的生产、生活和思想工作全盘负责。这就是干部包队。
    对一个生产小队的任务全盘负责，应当怎样去工作呢？不是一个人去干，而是去帮好基层干部。帮助基层干部出主意、想办法，健全和改进工作制度，帮助基层干部提高领导工作的水平，改进工作作风和工作方法。这就是说，帮助他们正确地贯彻执行党的方针政策，提高分析问题的能力，学会走群众路线，大搞群众运动。这样，事情就会办得更多、更快、更好。基层干部勤勤恳恳地在当地劳动和工作了许多年，对于他自己所负责的一个小队的生产，群众的生活和思想情况，是了解的。他们一般都受到群众的信任和爱戴，在工作上有许多高明的主意和办法。下去的干部要善于做“伯乐”，去发现他们好的工作方法，帮助他们提高一步，建立起必要的工作制度，帮助他们把好主意、好办法，总结提高，并且广为传播。同时要帮助和启发基层干部的积极性和创造性，让他们自己动手去解决各种各样的问题，通过实际工作提高基层干部的政治思想水平和工作能力。这样，包队干部在这里的时候，这里的工作是先进的，包队干部一旦离开以后，这里的工作也仍然会是先进的。这才算达到了“帮”的目的。
    有些包队干部热情积极，看到队里工作很多，任务繁重，往往把许多事情都包揽起来，自己去干，结果，下去的干部忙得不可开交，而那里的基层干部却在旁边没有多少事情可做，这就使他们的积极性和创造性受到了压抑。这些深入基层的干部，工作积极热情，不怕艰难困苦，满心想在短时期里改变那里的落后面貌，这种心愿自然是极好的。但是，如果只是单枪匹马地去干，不去发动和依靠那里的基层干部和群众，就会事与愿违。这些干部也可能做出一些成绩，甚至使生产小队的工作列为上游，但是，这些成绩是不巩固的。何况，在今天的情况下，一个生产小队的工作相当复杂，既要抓政治思想，又要抓生产和生活；就生产来说，除了农业，还有林、牧、副、渔。这样多的工作，一个人的本领再大，也包办不了，终究还要依靠基层干部和群众自己动手，才能把事情办好。
    当然，不要包办，也并不是把事情推开不管。下去的干部应当参加领导工作，并且分工负责一部分工作。对自己所分工负责的工作，应该通过自己的模范行动去帮助基层干部。在有些场合，基层干部和群众遇到了困难，自己不能解决，把问题提到面前，迫切需要有人来当机立断，做出样子。下去的干部就不应当推，而应当挺身而出，拿出自己的主意和办法，亲自做出样子来，这是不是包办呢？不是的。应该说，这也是一种帮法，用实际行动来帮，用干来帮，这种帮法，不但不会脱离群众，反而会得到基层干部和群众的赞同，作出良好的效果。
    要“帮”得好，还必须“干”好，“转”好，“学”好，先做一个普通劳动者，既了解点的经验，也掌握面的情况，既向基层干部学习，又向群众学习。在这样的基础上，出的主意，想的办法，才可能符合当时当地的客观实际，才能真正及时地解决具体问题。这样，下去的干部才能更好地把党的实事求是的工作作风，“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线的优良传统，真正带到基层工作中去，对于基层干部和群众会有很大的启发和帮助。这样的“帮”才是扎实的，也是最具体的。
