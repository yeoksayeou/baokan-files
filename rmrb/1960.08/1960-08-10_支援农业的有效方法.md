Effective Ways to Support Agriculture
Niu Qiyi

    The method adopted by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee of assigning different systems and departments to work on a contract basis with the people's communes is a very good way to strengthen the agricultural front and support agricultural production (Editor's note: see news on page one).

    In 1960, a new situation emerged in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region: after two years of continuous great leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, industry in the northern Xinjiang region developed rapidly, a large number of "small foreign groups" appeared, and the population of cities and industrial and mining areas increased significantly. In particular, the rapid westward extension of the Lanxin Railway brought favorable conditions for larger-scale construction in the autonomous region. On the other hand, it also required the autonomous region to support the country's socialist construction with more materials. Under this situation, agriculture, as the foundation of the national economy, must develop at a higher speed to meet the needs of socialist construction in northern Xinjiang, especially along the railway line.

    However, due to historical reasons, northern Xinjiang has more land and fewer people. Although agricultural production has increased significantly year after year, it still cannot meet the needs of socialist construction in the autonomous region. In order to solve this contradiction, the Autonomous Region Party Committee has adopted effective measures since 1958 to accelerate the development of agriculture in northern Xinjiang, especially along the railway line, by increasing a large amount of labor along the railway line, building a large number of water conservancy projects, reclaiming wasteland for cultivation, and strengthening the leadership along this line.

    The practice of the past two years, especially in this year's spring production, has proved that the leadership method of leading cadres from various systems taking charge of specific areas and going straight to the grassroots is a powerful measure to further realize the principle of "agriculture is the foundation of national economic development." The serious implementation of this measure has not only greatly promoted agricultural production along the railway line, making this year's spring agricultural production tasks along the railway line completed more, faster, and better, but also greatly improved leadership style and cadre style. The adoption of the method of contracting by various departments has greatly strengthened the sense of responsibility of the leaders of various departments, requiring leading cadres to go deep into the front line of production, deep into the masses, and work conscientiously, thereby greatly enriching leadership experience and greatly benefiting the better guidance of overall work. The leadership and working methods of cadres from various systems contracting specific areas have effectively promoted the support of agriculture by all walks of life. Since the adoption of this method, various systems and units in the autonomous region, especially industrial and transportation, finance and trade, culture and education, and political and legal departments, have not only done a good job in their own business through contracting specific areas, but also helped the communes run a large number of industries, trained a large number of technical personnel for the communes, and strengthened the communes' cultural, educational, health, welfare, and other undertakings.

    Although the situation in other places is not exactly the same as in Xinjiang, promoting this method in light of local conditions will certainly promote the faster development of agricultural production, thereby promoting the faster development of the entire national economy.

    支援农业的有效方法	牛其益
    新疆维吾尔自治区党委采取的各系统、各部门分片包干人民公社工作的办法，是加强农业战线、支援农业生产的一个很好的办法（编者注：消息见一版）。
    1960年新疆维吾尔自治区出现了这样一种新的形势：经过1958年和1959年两年的连续大跃进，北疆地区工业迅速发展，“小洋群”大批出现，城市和工矿区人口大量增加，特别是兰新铁路迅速西伸，一方面给自治区更大规模的建设带来良好的条件，另一方面也要求自治区以更多的物资支援国家的社会主义建设。在这种形势下面，作为国民经济基础的农业，就必须以更高的速度发展，以满足北疆地区，特别是铁路沿线社会主义建设的需要。
    但是，由于历史的原因，北疆地区土地多，人口少，农业生产尽管年年大幅度增长，仍不能满足自治区社会主义建设的需要。自治区党委为了解决这一矛盾，从1958年开始，就采取了给铁路沿线增加大量的劳动力、大量兴修水利和开荒造田，加强这一线的领导力量等等有力措施，来加速北疆特别是铁路沿线农业的发展。
    两年来特别是今年春季生产的实践证明，各系统领导干部分片包干一竿子插到底的领导方法，是进一步实现“农业是国民经济发展的基础”这一方针的有力措施。这一措施的认真执行，不仅大大推动了铁路沿线的农业生产，使今年铁路沿线的春季农业生产任务完成的又多、又快、又好；也大大改善了领导作风和干部作风。采用各部门包干的办法，极大地加强了各部门领导上的责任心，使领导干部必须深入生产第一线，深入群众，踏踏实实地工作，从而大大丰富了领导经验，对更好地指导全盘工作有极大好处。各系统干部分片包干的领导方法和工作方法，有效地推动了各行各业支援农业。自从采用了这个办法以后，自治区各系统、各单位，特别是工业交通、财经贸易、文化教育、政法等部门，不只通过分片包干做好了自己的业务工作，同时也帮助公社办了大批工业，给公社培养了大批的技术人员，加强了公社的文教、卫生、福利等事业。
    其他地方的情况虽然同新疆不尽一样，各地因地制宜的推行这个办法，也一定会促进农业生产更快的发展，从而促进整个国民经济更快的发展。
