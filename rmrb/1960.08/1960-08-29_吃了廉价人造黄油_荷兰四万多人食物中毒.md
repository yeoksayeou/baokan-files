Xinhua News Agency, Amsterdam News: Recently, 45,000 residents of the Netherlands fell ill from food poisoning after eating a cheap "Polenta" brand margarine. Two people have died.

The symptoms of those poisoned were the development of hives and a high fever lasting about ten days.

This "Polenta" brand margarine is mainly made of vegetable oil and is produced by a manufacturer in Rotterdam. When this margarine first went on the market, it was welcomed by Dutch people who generally could not afford butter because of its low price.

    吃了廉价人造黄油
    荷兰四万多人食物中毒
    新华社讯　阿姆斯特丹消息：荷兰最近有四万五千居民因食用一种廉价的“泊伦塔”牌人造黄油而中毒病倒，有两人已经死亡。
    中毒者的症状是身上发一种荨麻疹和发大约十天左右的高烧。
    这种“泊伦塔”牌人造黄油主要用植物油制成，是鹿特丹一家制造商生产的。这种人造黄油在市场上初销时即因为价格低廉而受到一般吃不起黄油的荷兰人的欢迎。
