Editor's Note: The New Hunan Daily recently published a series of readers' suggestions on late rice field management on its front page. These suggestions are excellent, and we have selected three for reference by other late rice areas.

    Regulate Water Temperature and Irrigate Late Rice Rationally
    Late rice grows in the high-temperature season in its early stage. Rational irrigation and drainage to regulate water temperature and ensure the normal growth of late rice is an important task.
    The Jile Production Team of Zhangshi Commune in Guiyang has come up with some methods to address this issue: For fields with good water conservancy conditions, the team maintains a water depth of just over one inch in the field from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, and conducts continuous irrigation with a thin stream of water; for fields with scarce water sources, the team regularly maintains a water depth of two to three inches, seizing the opportunity when the water temperature is low in the morning and evening to irrigate the fields with cool water, or drains water to expose the seedlings every two to three days in the evening. Regulating water temperature in this way can not only prevent the high temperature from scalding the rice seedlings, but also circulate air, enhance the activity of microorganisms in the soil, and promote the healthy growth of rice seedlings.
    Pay Attention to Eliminating the Phenomenon of Withered Tips and Yellow Seedlings
    The Laowuwan Work Group of Qingxi Brigade, Shaoshan People's Commune, has transplanted about 20 mu of double-cropping late rice. Generally, the growth is normal, but due to the lack of timely field management after transplanting, some plants have experienced withered tips, yellow seedlings, root burn, and dead clumps, resulting in slow greening after transplanting. A survey of six mu of large fields in the group showed an average death rate of 11.2%. This situation may also occur in other regions. If we do not pay close attention to it in a timely manner, it will affect the increase in production. The group convened a forum of experienced farmers, and inspected the fields to adopt the following measures to remedy the situation: (1) Deep irrigation to protect seedlings and promote rapid greening: Because the temperature is high and the light is strong during the early growing season of double-cropping late rice, shallow irrigation can easily burn the roots. Generally, a water depth of one inch to one and a half inches should be maintained before the seedlings turn green. When transplanting large fields, increase the number of people to carry out a blitz, so as not to affect irrigation due to not being able to finish transplanting at one time, so as to achieve immediate irrigation after transplanting. (2) Establish a special water management system to ensure that someone is responsible for each field. (3) Improve the quality of rice transplanting: transplant deeply (one inch to one and a half inches), firmly, upright, and evenly to ensure that there is no lodging. (4) Replenish seedlings in a timely manner to ensure full and complete stands. After the group implemented these measures, the effect was good, and the situation of withered tips, yellow seedlings, and dead seedlings was basically reversed.
    Quickly Pick Egg Masses and Resolutely Eliminate Rice Borers
    According to key inspections, the third generation of rice stem borer adults is now at its peak of laying eggs in some areas. In an experimental field of 1.6 mu in Huanghua Commune, Changsha County, rice was transplanted on July 28. On August 1, an inspection of 1,200 rice clumps revealed 34 rice stem borer egg masses; on August 2, another 205 egg masses were picked. If they are not eliminated immediately, the egg masses will turn into larvae and harm the rice seedlings. We suggest early inspection and resolutely eliminate rice stem borers during the egg mass stage.

### 管好晚稻的三项建议

    管好晚稻的三项建议
    编者按：新湖南报近日在一版连续刊登了一些有关晚稻田间管理的读者建议。这些建议很好，我们选登了三件供其他晚稻地区参考。
    调节水温合理灌溉晚稻
    晚稻前期生长处在高温季节，合理排灌，调节水温，使晚禾生长正常，是一件重要事情。
    桂阳樟市公社极乐生产队对这个问题想了一些办法：水利条件好的田，在上午十时至下午三时的一段时间，本田保持一寸多深的水，并且进行细水长流套灌；水源较困难的田，则经常保持二至三寸深的水，抓住早晚水温低的时机，灌凉水入田，或者每隔二至三天，在晚上排水露秧。这样调节水温，不仅可以防止高温烫伤禾苗，还可流通空气，增强土壤里微生物的活动，促使禾苗生长良好。
    注意消灭枯尖黄苗现象
    韶山人民公社清溪大队老屋湾作业组，已插的二十来亩双季晚稻，一般生长正常，但由于插后管理工夫没有及时跟上去，有的发生枯尖黄苗、烧根死蔸现象，插后回青慢。如在该组六亩大丘调查，平均死蔸达11.2％。这种情况其他地区可能也有产生。如果不及时加以高度重视，将影响增产，该组召集了老农座谈，并临田察看，采取如下几项措施补救：（1）深灌保苗，促使禾苗迅速转青：因为双季晚稻前期生育期气温高，光照强，水灌浅了容易灼伤根部。一般在返青前保持一寸至一寸半的水。在插大丘时，增加人员突击，不致因一时插不完而影响灌水，以便做到即插即灌。（2）建立专人看水制度，保证丘丘有人负责。（3）提高插秧质量：插深（一寸至一寸半）、插稳、插正、插匀，保证无倒苗现象。（4）及时补蔸，齐苗全苗。全组推行这些措施以后，效果良好，基本上扭转了枯尖黄苗死苗局面。
    快摘卵块坚决消灭螟害
    据重点检查，现在第三代三化螟成虫产卵在一些地方已达高峰。长沙县黄花公社有一丘一点六亩的试验田，是7月28日插的秧，8月1日检查了一千二百蔸禾，摘到三化螟卵三十四块；8月2日又摘了二百零五块。如果不马上消灭，卵块则将化成幼虫，为害禾苗。我们建议及早检查，坚决把三化螟消灭在卵块期。
