Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 2nd: Workers in the Liaoning Province light industry system are devising various methods to improve product quality and increase variety. Of the more than two hundred major products produced in the first half of the year, about one-quarter reached advanced domestic quality levels; during the same period, the province also successfully trial-produced more than nine thousand new products, of which more than four thousand have been put into production one after another.

Since the beginning of this year, while production has increased substantially, the Liaoning Province light industry system has focused on improving product quality and increasing variety, striving for an all-round and sustained leap forward to meet the growing needs of the people's lives. At the beginning of this year, the light industry system formulated plans at all levels and measures for each item, mobilizing workers to launch a campaign to learn from, catch up with, and create famous brands. The planning of various factories in the textile system was revised three times, and the varieties participating in the competition increased from the original two hundred to more than seven hundred. For each product, advanced quality samples of domestic products of the same type were found, and item-by-item analysis and comparison were carried out. Not long ago, several large textile factories sent people with more than two hundred product samples to fraternal factories for appraisal and to learn advanced experience. In this way, the textile system not only improved the quality of many products, with the quality of some products reaching the advanced national level, but also successfully trial-produced many high-quality new products such as transparent printed cloth, printed tussah silk velvet, and otter velvet. In order to improve product quality, the workers of the Yingkou Northeast Musical Instrument Factory collected more than ten kinds of advanced domestic and foreign samples, mobilized the workers to dissect them piece by piece, and compared them with the factory's products; after finding the shortcomings of their products, they immediately organized the workers to launch a key breakthrough battle, which resulted in a significant improvement in the quality of the factory's six major products, including pianos, organs, violins, and accordions, with three of them reaching the advanced national level.

In order to improve product quality and increase product variety, the workers of the light industry system throughout the province have also been engaged in scientific research and bold innovation. The Shenyang Glass Instrument Factory established research institutes and research groups from the factory to the workshops, with more than two hundred professional and amateur scientific researchers, closely integrating scientific research activities with production, enabling the factory to successfully trial-produce more than one hundred kinds of high-grade new products, of which six have reached the advanced national level. In order to break through the quality key in alcohol production, the Dalian Brewing Factory boldly innovated the original technology through the "three-way combination" method, which not only significantly improved the quality of alcohol but also successfully trial-produced high-purity alcohol with excellent quality. In the process of conducting scientific research, many factories have also established technical information contacts with factories in other regions.

Now, the light industry system of the whole province has formulated a third-quarter plan, and is continuing to carry out the movement of learning from, catching up with, and creating famous brands in depth, striving to have more products reach the advanced national level in quality; striving to manufacture more varieties and better colors of products to meet the needs of the people's lives.

    提高产品质量　增加花色品种
    辽宁轻工业赶名牌创名牌
    四分之一的主要产品质量赶上国内先进水平，上半年试制成功九千多种新产品新华社沈阳2日电　辽宁省轻工业系统职工多方设法，努力提高产品质量，增加花色品种。他们在上半年生产出的两百多种主要产品，约有四分之一质量赶上了国内先进水平；在同一期间，全省还试制成功九千多种新产品，其中有四千多种已经陆续投入生产。
    今年以来，辽宁省轻工业系统在生产大幅度增长的同时，大抓提高产品质量和增加花色品种，力争全面持续跃进，以满足人民生活日益增长的需要。今年初，轻工业系统就层层制订规划，项项制订措施，发动职工开展了学名牌、赶名牌、创名牌运动。纺织系统各厂的规划修订了三次，参加评比的品种由原来二百多种增加到七百多种，每种产品都找出了国内同类型产品的质量先进样品，逐项进行分析对比。不久以前，几个大纺织工厂又派人携带二百多种产品样品，请兄弟工厂帮助鉴定，学习先进经验。这样，纺织系统不仅提高了许多产品质量，有些产品质量达到了全国先进水平，而且试制成功了透明印花布、印花柞蚕绒、水獭绒等许多优质新产品。营口市东北乐器厂职工为提高产品质量，搜集了十多种国内外先进样品，发动职工逐件解剖，与厂内产品评比对照；找出自己产品的缺陷后，就立即组织职工开展攻关战役，结果使全厂钢琴、风琴、提琴、手风琴等六种主要产品质量都有显著提高，其中有三种产品赶上了全国先进水平。
    为了提高产品质量和增加产品品种，全省轻工业系统职工还大搞科学研究，大胆创造革新。沈阳市玻璃仪器厂从厂部到车间分别建立了研究所和研究组，拥有二百多名专业和业余的科学研究人员，把科学研究活动与生产密切结合，使这个厂试制成功了一百多种高级的新产品，其中有六种已达到全国先进水平。大连酿造厂为突破酒精生产中的质量关键，通过“三结合”的办法，对原有工艺进行大胆革新，不仅使酒精质量显著提高，而且试制成功了质量优良的高纯度酒精。在大搞科学研究中，许多工厂还与外地工厂建立技术情报联络。
    现在，全省轻工业系统又制订了第三季度规划，正继续深入开展学名牌、赶名牌、创名牌的运动，力争有更多的产品质量赶上全国先进水平；力争制造品种更多、花色更好的产品，满足人民生活的需要。
