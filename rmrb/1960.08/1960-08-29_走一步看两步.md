    Look One Step, See Two Steps

    I don't know how to play chess, but I've heard that the measure of a good chess player is how many steps they can predict when playing. If they can predict three moves, it means they have some skill; otherwise, they will only face defeat against strong opponents. From this, we can draw the conclusion that you can't just look one step and take one step in chess. You have to look at where you are going and see several steps ahead, recognizing the development and changes in the chess situation, in order to win repeatedly.

    I used to be a tractor driver. I think every driver has a profound understanding that to drive a tractor skillfully and smoothly, you must look ahead a certain distance. This way, you can fully understand the tractor's direction and decide whether to turn the steering wheel (control lever) to the left or right; whether to put the gearshift in low gear or high gear; and whether to reduce or increase the throttle, among other operating measures. Otherwise, it would be difficult to control the tractor, and you might even crash into a pole beside the road or overturn into a ditch, causing unimaginable consequences.

    Take walking, for example. No one walks while only looking at their toes. It's even more true for us when making revolution and carrying out movements. We must look one step and see two steps, see far and recognize clearly, both advancing steadily with a plan and steps, and leaping forward vigorously. Communism is our ultimate goal. To achieve this great goal, we must carry out a series of mass revolutionary movements, and these movements are just one of the many steps we must take.

    For those who believe in continuous revolution, the revolution is endless. After two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, our country has entered a new stage of sustained leap. We are striving for an all-round leap forward in 1960. Our plant breathes the same air as our country. We are not satisfied with the achievements we gained in 1959. Instead, cherishing the ambitious goal of achieving greater success in 1960, we won a complete victory in the first half of the year. Especially in March, in the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, all the workers of the plant contributed their boundless wisdom and brought their conscious subjective initiative into full play with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, which greatly changed the technical aspect of our plant's production. We completely abandoned carrying poles, eliminated heavy physical labor, and reduced manual operation from over thirty percent to a few percent today. Who wouldn't be extremely happy to hear such news! But at the same time, some people developed the mistaken idea of "taking a breather."

    In response to this situation, the plant's Party committee put forward the fighting slogan of "Climbing the mountain in March, reaching the sky in April, and reaching the ninth heaven in May," which made those people suddenly realize that they had strayed onto the wrong path of "the theory of revolution's end." In the great battle of March, we achieved "one plant equaling two plants, increasing production and saving labor," doubling work efficiency and saving more than 700 laborers; however, we are still far from the goal of "four modernizations." We must continue to follow the Party committee's instructions and march forward along the path of "one plant equaling several plants, further saving personnel." The Party committee's instruction is completely correct, far-sighted, imbued with the spirit of continuous revolution, and consistent with "looking one step, seeing two steps."
    
    In order to build our country into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture and a modern science and culture as soon as possible, we must learn the method of looking ahead as we take each step, seeing the second step, the third step, or even further, when we take the first step. Only in this way can we have clear goals and always maintain vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm.

    To see further and look several steps ahead, we need to constantly improve our political sensitivity and our ability to identify new things, and fully support them. To do this, we need to constantly study revolutionary theory and master the objective laws of things. Specifically, we must unremittingly study the theory of Marxism-Leninism, study the works of our great leader Chairman Mao, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm ourselves, see our steps clearly, and do our work well.

    走一步看两步
    武钢金属结构厂青工　韩树桢
    我不会下棋，不过，听人说，衡量一个人棋下的好坏，要看他下棋时能够预测几步。如果他能预测三步棋，就说明这个人下棋有些本事；否则，他就只有在强手面前失败。由此，我们便可以得出这样一个结论：下棋是不能看一步走一步的；要走一步，看几步，认清棋势的发展变化，才能够屡战屡胜。
    我曾经是一个拖拉机手。我想，对于每一个驾驶员来说，都会有这样一个深刻的体会：要想把拖拉机驾驶得得心应手、运行自如的话，两眼就必须向前看一定远的路程。这样，才能充分了解拖拉机前进的方向，以此决定方向盘（操纵杆）应该向左打呢，还是向右打；变速杆应该置于低档呢，还是应该推到高速的位置上；油门应该小些呢，还是应该加大等操作措施。不然的话，拖拉机就难以掌握驾驶，甚至会因措手不及而闯上路旁的电杆，或翻入路旁的水沟，造成难以想像的后果。
      就拿人们走路来说吧，谁走路也不是只看着自己的脚尖走的。我们干革命、搞运动更是如此。要走一步，看两步，要看得远，认得清，既要脚踏实地有计划有步骤地前进，又需要轰轰烈烈地跨马飞跃。共产主义是我们最终的目的。要达到这一伟大的目标，必须进行一连串的群众革命运动，而这些运动，就是我们要跨若干步中的一步。
    对于不断革命论者来说，革命是无止境的，无尽头的。我们的国家经过两年连续大跃进之后，已进入了持续跃进的新阶段。正在争取1960年的全面跃进。我厂是和我们的国家共呼吸的。我们没有满足于1959年的既得成绩，而是怀着1960年获得更大成就的雄心大志，夺得了上半年的满堂红。特别是在3月份，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，全厂职工以冲天的革命干劲，贡献出自己的无穷智慧，发挥了自觉的主观能动性，因而使我厂的生产技术面貌起了很大的变化。彻底放下了扁担，消灭了笨重的体力劳动，手工操作由百分之三十几降到现在的百分之几。听到这样的消息后，谁不高兴万分啊！但同时也有些人产生了“松一口气”的错误思想。
    厂党委针对这种情况，提出了“3月上山，4月上天，5月更上九重天”的战斗口号，这才使那些人恍然大悟，原来他们走入了“革命到顶论”的歧途上去了。3月大战，我们做到了“一厂顶两厂，增产又省人”，工效翻了一番，还节约了七百多个劳动力；但是，离“四化”的目标还很远。我们还必须按着党委的指示，沿着“一厂顶几厂，人员再节省”的道路昂首前进。党委的这一指示是完全正确的，是有远见的，是具有不断革命的精神的，也是符合“走一步，看两步”的。
    为了早日把我国建设成为一个具有现代化工业、现代化农业和现代科学文化的伟大社会主义强国，我们就必须学会走上步看下步的方法，要在迈出第一步的时候，看到第二步、第三步，甚至更远些。这样，才会有明确的目标，才会永远保持旺盛的革命热情。
    要使自己看得远些，多看几步，这就需要不断提高自己的政治敏感和对新生事物的鉴别能力，并全力支持它。而要想作到这一点，就需要不断学习革命理论，掌握事物的客观规律。具体地说，就是要坚持不懈地学习马克思列宁主义的理论，学习我们伟大领袖毛主席的著作，用毛泽东思想武装起来，看清步子，作好工作。
