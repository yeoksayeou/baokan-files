    Transport Coal Out at the Fastest Speed
    Coal is the raw material for thermal power generation, coking, iron smelting, and steelmaking, and it is also an indispensable fuel for people's daily life. It holds a pivotal position in the entire national economy, just like grain, steel, and cotton. Now that the Beginning of Autumn has passed, winter will come in the blink of an eye, and the cold winter will require more coal. Therefore, producing more coal and transporting the produced coal quickly has become an urgent and major task for the coal and transportation fronts.
    There are various ways to quickly transport the produced coal. For example, first, mobilize idle labor among the non-agricultural population in areas where trains do not reach to transport "stagnant coal" to nearby train and bus stations using the "ants moving grain" method, waiting for opportunities to transport it; second, appropriately reduce the production of "stagnant coal" and mobilize coal miners from areas with inconvenient transportation to work in coal mines with convenient transportation, increasing the production of these coal mines; third, quickly complete the construction of coal transportation branch lines that must be completed this year to increase coal transportation capacity, and so on. These are all good methods, and various regions can implement them according to local conditions. However, the most urgent task at present is how to further tap the potential of coal transportation and improve coal transportation efficiency. Therefore, the most important method is to strengthen cooperation between railways and mines, like the Jingxi Mining Bureau and Mentougou Central Station, and through the enthusiasm of the vast number of railway and mine workers, do everything possible to strengthen coal transportation work and efficiently transport the produced coal to places where it is needed.
    Transporting coal out at the fastest speed! This is the most basic content of the road-mine cooperation implemented by Mentougou Central Station and Jingxi Mining Bureau. The transportation lines, equipment, and lines of the Jingxi Mining Bureau's affiliated mines are relatively old and backward, and the transportation efficiency is relatively low. However, the employees of these two units, realizing the great significance of timely coal transportation to the development of the entire national economy, regarded completing the national coal transportation task as a common responsibility. When there were difficulties in manpower, they supported each other; when there were difficulties in material resources, they helped each other; when backward lines, coal bins, and loading and unloading equipment hindered the completion of the increasing transportation tasks, they resolutely joined hands and used the methods of hard work, indigenous methods combined with foreign methods, and indigenous methods to carry out technological transformation. Finally, they finally obtained coal from time and efficiency from cooperation, increasing the loading and unloading efficiency by one to four times, and transported all the coal produced in the first seven months of this year. This is a brilliant example of high-speed coal transportation in road-mine cooperation! Here, there are people with fire-like enthusiasm who solve specific problems in a down-to-earth manner; here, there are people who do not bow their heads to difficulties, but actively create conditions to overcome difficulties with a fearless spirit; more importantly, there is a mass movement here. Thousands of railway and mine workers have been mobilized to participate in the struggle for high-speed coal transportation.
    Workers on the transportation and coal fronts, join hands, learn from the spirit of cooperation in coal transportation of the workers of Mentougou Central Station and Jingxi Mining Bureau, and transport the coal out at the fastest speed! The country needs more coal to better meet the needs of economic construction and people's lives.

    用最快的速度把煤炭运出来
    煤炭是火力发电、炼焦、炼铁、炼钢的原料，也是人们日常生活中不可缺少的燃料。它在整个国民经济中，和粮食、钢铁、棉花一样，有举足轻重之势。现在立秋已过，转瞬冬来，寒冬需要更多的煤炭。因此，生产更多的煤炭并且把生产出来的煤炭迅速地运输出来，就成为煤炭战线和运输战线上一项急迫的、重大的任务。
    把生产出来的煤炭迅速运输出来，可以有多种途径。例如，第一，把不通火车的地方的“呆滞煤”，发动非农业人口中的闲散劳动力，用“蚂蚁运粮”的办法，运输到火车、汽车站附近，待机就运；第二，适当减少“呆滞煤”的生产，调动交通不便地区的煤矿工人到交通便利的煤矿劳动，增加这些煤矿的生产；第三，迅速完成今年必须完成的运煤支线的修建工作，增加煤炭的运输能力，等等。这些都是好办法，各地可以因地制宜地实行。但是，当前最迫切的，是如何进一步挖掘运煤潜力、提高运煤效率的问题。因此，最重要的办法，是像京西矿务局和门头沟中心站那样，加强路矿协作，通过广大路矿职工的积极性，来千方百计加强煤炭的运输工作，把生产出来的煤炭，高效率地调运到需用的地方去。
    用最快的速度把煤炭运出来！这是门头沟中心站和京西矿务局实行路矿协作最基本的内容。京西矿务局所属各矿的运输线，设备和线路都比较陈旧落后，运输效率比较低。但是这两个单位的职工，认识到及时运煤对发展整个国民经济的重大意义，把完成国家运煤任务作为共同的职责，在人力困难时，就互相支援；在物力困难时，就互相帮助；当落后的线路、煤仓和装卸设备妨碍日益增大的运输任务完成时，就坚决携起手来，用穷干苦干、土洋并举、土法上马的办法，实行技术改造。最后，终于向时间要得了煤，向协作要得了效率，把装卸效率提高一至四倍，全部运出了今年头七个月的产煤。这是在路矿协作中实行高速运煤的一个光辉榜样！在这里，有的是有火一样热情的、踏踏实实解决具体问题的人；在这里，有的是见困难不低头，反而积极创造条件，以大无畏精神克服困难的人；更重要的，是这里有群众运动。千千万万的路矿职工，动员起来，参加了高速度运煤的斗争。
    运输战线和煤炭战线上的职工，携起手来，学习门头沟中心站和京西矿务局职工们协作运煤的精神，用最快的速度把煤运出来！国家需要更多的煤来更好地满足经济建设和人民生活的需要。
