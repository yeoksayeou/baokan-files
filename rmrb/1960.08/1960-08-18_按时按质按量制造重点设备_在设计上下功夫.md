Contribute Ideas for Increased Steel Production

    Manufacture Key Equipment on Time, with High Quality and Quantity
    Put Effort into Design
    Shi Junwen, Head of the Design Section, Shenyang Fan Factory

    Reforming product design is of great significance. This can not only save manpower and materials to manufacture more equipment, but also produce equipment with better quality and higher efficiency. Our designers should engage in both the design of new varieties and the continuous innovation of old products, contributing more to the high-speed development of steel production.

    Since the beginning of this year, our factory has designed seven new varieties and reformed sixty-five old products. These old products, after being reformed, not only save materials and labor, but also greatly improve their efficiency in use. For example, the sixty-five old products we have already reformed, calculated based on this year's total output, can save more than 500,000 man-hours and 6,500 tons of steel materials. One type of mine axial-flow fan we reformed broke the general technical rule that fans cannot return air. Based on the output of this type of product this year, it can save users more than 7.8 million yuan in investment in building return air ducts. At the same time, due to improved efficiency, it can also save more than 2.4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity each year.

    In the process of reforming product design, it is necessary to implement the idea of continuous revolution. Facts have proven that as long as we break with superstition and liberate our minds, many old products can be reformed again and again, becoming more and more refined. For example, the 9-37 type fan we produce, after the first revolution, can save 2,500 tons of materials and 110,000 man-hours a year; later, after more than 20 experiments, the second reform was carried out, and the structure and volume became more compact, which can save another 1,000 tons of materials and 90,000 man-hours, and the efficiency has also improved significantly compared with the past.

    按时按质按量制造重点设备
    在设计上下功夫
    沈阳扇风机厂设计科科长　施俊文
    改革产品设计意义很大。这不仅可以节省人工、材料，以便制造更多的设备，而且能够制造出质量更好、效能更高的设备。我们设计人员应该一面大搞新品种设计，一面不断革新老产品，为钢铁生产高速度发展贡献更多的力量。
    我们工厂今年以来，除设计了七种新品种以外，还改革了六十五种老产品。这些老产品经过改革以后，不仅省料、省工，而且大大提高了使用效率。如我们已经改革的六十五种老产品，按今年全年的产量计算，可以节省五十多万个工时、六千五百吨钢铁材料。我们改革的一种矿井轴流通风机，打破了一般风机不能返风的技术常规，按今年这种产品的产量计算，就可以为用户节省建设返风道的投资七百八十多万元，同时，由于效率提高，每年还可以节省二十四亿多度电。
    在改革产品设计的过程中，必须贯彻不断革命的思想。事实证明，只要破除迷信，解放思想，很多老产品是可以一改再改，愈改愈精的。例如我们生产的9—37型风格，经过第一次革命，一年可以节省二千五百吨材料，十一万个工时；后来又经过二十多次试验，进行了第二次改革，结构、体积更加小巧，又可以节约一千吨材料、九万个工时，效率也比过去提高了许多。
