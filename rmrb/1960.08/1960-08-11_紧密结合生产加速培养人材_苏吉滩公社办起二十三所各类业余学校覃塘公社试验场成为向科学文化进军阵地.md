    Closely Integrate Production to Accelerate Talent Cultivation
    Sujitan Commune Runs Twenty-Three Various Spare-Time Schools; Qintang Commune Experimental Farm Becomes a Front for Marching Towards Science and Culture
    (Our Report) The Sujitan Commune in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, starting from the needs of production and considering the relatively dispersed residences and high mobility of production in pastoral areas, has established twenty-three various spare-time schools in accordance with local conditions. Over the past two years, these schools have trained more than 100 commune and team cadres, accountants, and tractor drivers, as well as more than 180 junior and intermediate veterinary personnel, greatly enhancing the commune's leadership and technical strength.
    Starting from the needs of production, linking with reality, combining with production, and serving production are the characteristics of Sujitan Commune's large-scale development of spare-time education. Most spare-time schools offer three courses: politics, culture, and technology. At the same time, they pay great attention to integrating course content with production. For example, the technical courses of the animal husbandry and veterinary spare-time middle school are mostly taught at the production site, achieving learning by doing, and combining learning with application, with very good results. The experience in raising and managing livestock summarized by the teachers and students of the animal husbandry and veterinary spare-time middle school of Sujitan Brigade, which involves appropriately advancing the weaning time of lambs to ensure the health of ewes, and the special medicine they made for treating lamb dysentery, have powerfully promoted the rapid development of animal husbandry production.
    Animal husbandry production is highly mobile. In order to solve the learning problems of the majority of grazing personnel, who account for most of the young and middle-aged population, the commune's Party committee also generally adopted the method of having learning organizations follow production organizations, learning content follow production needs, classrooms follow livestock herds, and books follow people. Learning methods were also changed with the seasons; in winter, when residences were relatively concentrated, the brigade served as the central point, with classes rotating in groups; in spring, when moving enclosures was frequent and the distance between teams was relatively far, the team served as the central point, with the brigade sending teachers to give lectures and team tutors providing guidance; in summer and autumn, when grazing personnel were scattered and highly mobile, the focus was on reviewing and consolidating, supplemented by concentrated lectures on new courses. Some teams also adopted the practice of having the team's herders take turns herding at night and taking turns attending classes in the evening, ensuring that spare-time learning could be maintained throughout the year.
    (Our Report) The Qintang People's Commune Agricultural Experimental Farm in Guixian County, Guangxi, has achieved comprehensive harvests in production, education, and scientific research over the past year due to its close integration with production and the development of agricultural scientific research and spare-time education work, becoming a front for the commune to march towards science and culture.
    The task of the Qintang Commune Experimental Farm is mainly to explore ways to increase production and to cultivate commune members who have both socialist consciousness and cultural and scientific knowledge. According to the technical specialties of the members, seven scientific research groups were formed for rice, dryland crops, soil and fertilizer, horticulture, animal husbandry, hydrometeorology, and water conservancy and irrigation. In addition to conducting scientific research, each group must also complete two tasks: production and cultural learning; at the same time, according to the level of education of the members, literacy, senior primary school, and junior high school classes were formed for systematic cultural learning. In order to effectively ensure the completion of this task, the "four implementations" and "three guarantees" were implemented in organizational measures. The four implementations are the implementation of land, agricultural tools, personnel, experimental projects, and learning tasks; the three guarantees are to ensure the timely completion of production, scientific research, and cultural learning tasks, with responsibilities extending to the very end.
    In the process of scientific experimentation, the most prominent difficulty was that the cultural level of the members in the farm could not keep up with the needs of scientific research. In response to this situation, the Party branch of the experimental farm vigorously developed spare-time cultural education based on the principle of learning what is done and studying what is researched. It not only ran literacy classes but also spare-time senior primary schools and junior high schools, so that everyone participated in cultural learning, achieving consistency between learning and application. The result of conducting spare-time education in close combination with scientific research not only filled the farm with a surge of cultural learning and promoted the smooth development of scientific research but also directly promoted production. Wu Shoudong, a member who had only read four volumes of junior primary school, has reached the cultural level of junior high school after a year of studying culture and conducting experiments, and has become the head of the rice research group, capable of leading grafting experiments on more than ten crops. Among the members of the experimental farm, fifteen people, including Li Xiwei, Wu Shoudong, and Qin Biqun, have now improved their culture and can preliminarily grasp the methods of conducting scientific experiments on various crops, and are known by the masses as "native experts." Another fifty-five people can preliminarily grasp the basic knowledge of agricultural science and some items of scientific experiments. (Gong Chenghua)

    紧密结合生产加速培养人材
    苏吉滩公社办起二十三所各类业余学校覃塘公社试验场成为向科学文化进军阵地
    本报讯　青海省海北藏族自治州门源回族自治县的苏吉滩公社，从生产需要出发，根据牧业区居住比较分散、生产流动性较大的特点，因地制宜地办起了二十三所各类业余学校。两年多来，这些学校已为公社培养了一百多名社、队干部、会计、拖拉机手以及一百八十多个初、中级兽医人员，大大地增强了公社的领导力量和技术力量。
    从生产需要出发，联系实际，结合生产，为生产服务，是苏吉滩公社大办业余教育的特点。业余学校大都设有政治、文化、技术三门课，同时在课程内容方面十分注意与生产相结合。例如，畜牧兽医业余中学的技术课，大部分都是在生产现场讲授的，做到了边干边学，学用结合，效果很好。苏吉滩大队的畜牧兽医业余中学师生总结出来的把羔羊断奶时间适当提前，从而保证母羊健壮的饲养管理经验，以及他们制造的治疗羔羊痢疾的特效药，都有力地推动了畜牧业生产的迅速发展。
    畜牧业生产流动性较大，为了解决占青壮年中大多数的放牧人员的学习问题，这个公社党委在大办业余教育的过程中，还普遍采取了学习组织跟着生产组织走，学习内容跟着生产需要走，课堂跟着畜群走，书本跟人走的办法。学习方式也做到了随着季节改变；冬天居住比较集中，便以大队为集中点，分组轮流上课；春季搬圈的次数比较多，小队之间距离比较远，就以小队为集中点，大队派教师巡回讲课，小队辅导员分别辅导；夏秋季放牧人员活动分散，流动性很大，便以复习、巩固为主，集中讲授新课为辅。有些小队还采用了小队的放牧员轮流夜牧，轮流在晚上参加听课，保证了业余学习能够常年坚持。
    本报讯　广西贵县覃塘人民公社农业试验场由于紧密结合生产，开展农业科学研究和业余教育工作，一年多来，生产、教育、科学研究获得全面丰收，成为公社向科学文化进军的阵地。
    覃塘公社试验场的任务主要是探索增产的途径，同时培养既有社会主义觉悟又有文化科学知识的公社社员。按照社员各人的技术专长，编成水稻、旱地作物、土肥、园艺、畜牧、水文气象和水利灌溉等七个科学研究组，各组除进行科学研究外，还要完成生产和文化学习两个任务；同时又根据社员文化程度的高低，编成扫盲、高小和初中班进行系统的文化学习。为了切实保证完成这个任务，在组织措施上又贯彻“四落实”和“三保证”。四落实是土地、农具落实，人员落实，试验项目落实，学习任务落实；三保证是保证生产、科学研究、文化学习三项任务按时完成，一竿子插到底。
    在科学试验过程中，最突出的困难就是场内社员文化水平赶不上科学研究的需要。试验场党支部针对这个情况，就根据做什么学什么，研究什么学什么的原则，大力开展业余文化教育，既办扫盲班，又办业余高小和初中班，使人人都参加了文化学习，做到了学用一致。紧密结合科学研究开展业余教育的结果，不仅使场内充满了文化学习的热潮，促进了科学研究工作顺利的开展，而且直接推动了生产。原来只读过初小四册的社员吴守东，一年来通过边学习文化边搞试验后，现在已达到初中文化水平，成为能够领导进行十多种作物嫁接试验的水稻研究组长。在试验场的社员中，现在已有李锡伟、吴守东、覃必群等十五人由于提高了文化能够较初步掌握进行各种农作物科学试验的方法，被群众称为“土专家”，还有五十五人能初步掌握农业科学基本耕作知识和一些项目的科学试验。　（龚成华）
