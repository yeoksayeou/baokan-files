Taking the Lead in Hard Work to Overcome Difficulties, Helping the Backward Catch Up with the Advanced
Ten Thousand Cadres in the Longnan Mountainous Area March into the Deep Mountains and Old Forests

(Our report) Ten thousand cadres in the Longnan mountainous area of Gansu Province have plunged into the forefront of production, settling down in remote mountain areas and backward communes and teams. In the Tianshui area, 70% of the cadres from various organs have gone deep into the front lines, and the number of cadres at the county, commune, and brigade levels participating in and leading production at the grassroots level is also rapidly increasing. Leading cadres at all levels are taking the lead in working in remote, high-altitude, and cold deep mountain and old forest areas, where they eat, live, work, and discuss matters with the masses. Yang Fuhan, the director of the Zhongzhai Commune in Wenxian County, went to the southernmost backward production team, Xinzhai Production Team, on the border of Gansu and Sichuan, to serve as the party branch secretary. Through detailed investigation and research, he found that the root cause of the team's backwardness was limited arable land and low yields. Therefore, he immediately mobilized the masses to conscientiously implement the principle of simultaneously expanding acreage and increasing yields, doing everything possible to expand arable land, planting more high-yield grain crops, and helping the team establish some medicinal herb bases. As the area lacked good varieties, he personally climbed high mountains and explored old forests, walking to Nanping in Sichuan to transport back the corn, soybeans, broad beans, and medicinal herb varieties he had exchanged for, which greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the masses. The sowing progress increased from 40 mu per day to around 100 mu, planting the seeds of prosperity for this remote and impoverished team. Nian Shenglin, the party secretary of the Pingluo Commune in Wudu, moved his command post to Mingyue Mountain. To solve the problem of the aqueduct on the Huayagou canal, he convened a "Five Immortals Meeting" (experienced farmers, technicians, cadres, youth, and women) and looked for "skilled craftsmen" among the masses. As a result, they found Communist Party member Zhang Rongshi and carpenter Zhang Huaizhong, who diligently studied and used indigenous methods to build an aerial aqueduct, enabling the key water conservancy project to play a timely role in combating drought.

The cadres who have gone deep into the backward production teams and remote mountainous areas are also making friends with poor and lower-middle peasants, closely uniting with local cadres, working hard, overcoming difficulties, thoroughly transforming the backward situation, and promoting the rapid development of all tasks. After cadres from Huicheng, Xili, Wenxian, and Tianshui City went deep into the shady and damp mountainous areas, they discovered that a small number of cadres and masses had a paralytic idea that "if the shady mountains yield a good harvest, we will definitely be able to produce more grain this year," and they were not paying close attention to the field management of autumn crops. They immediately organized the commune members to discuss this, corrected the paralyzing emotions, and launched weeding and fertilizer application activities. After cadres at various places went deep into the grassroots, they helped grassroots cadres rationally allocate labor based on the busy farming season, and used methods such as reducing, compressing, extracting, and transferring labor to invest 70% to 80% of the labor force into the forefront of agricultural production.

The cadres who went deep into the front lines conscientiously implemented the decision of the Tianshui Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Based on the characteristics of the Longnan area, where communes are generally larger and residences are scattered, and the experience of promoting the "two-five system" in the previous period, counties, communes, and brigades actively implemented the "three-seven system" of leadership, that is, the first three days of each ten-day period were used for study, meetings, and work arrangements, and the last seven days were used to go deep into the front lines of production, participate in production, and lead production. They turned around in the morning, worked at noon, and helped in the evening, truly helping grassroots cadres solve problems. During the three days of centralized study and work arrangement, one day was guaranteed for study time. The location of each concentration, the participants, and the discussion topics were arranged in advance by the county and commune party committees and the brigade general party branches, and the relevant personnel were notified. In addition to specialized studies, cadres generally gathered in communes and teams to study, inspect, and arrange work. At the same time, cadres from county and commune-level organs who worked in communes and production teams gathered once a month to participate in "three-seven system" activities at the county level, summarizing, studying, and arranging the work of their departments. Therefore, they motivated many rural non-detached party branch secretaries and brigade cadres to participate in the "three-seven system" activities, so that production and learning promoted each other, with immediate results. The party committee of the Fude Commune in Huicheng County organized cadres to study the editorial of the Gansu Daily "Analyze Specific Problems Specifically," and specifically analyzed the problem that some production teams were slow in harvesting wheat. They found that it was due to improper labor organization, and immediately organized various specialized teams for harvesting, threshing, drying, transporting, weighing, and warehousing, and determined the responsibility system, which doubled the speed of wheat harvesting.

    带头苦干克服困难　帮助后进赶先进
    陇南山区万名干部奔赴深山老林
    本报讯　甘肃省陇南山区万名干部奔赴生产第一线，纷纷深入到边远山区和后进社、队安家落户。天水专区各机关有70％的干部深入到第一线，县、社、大队各级干部深入基层参加生产、领导生产的也迅速增加。各级领导干部带头到偏僻高寒的深山老林地区工作，他们和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。文县中寨公社社主任杨伏汉，深入到最南部的甘川边境上的一个后进生产队——新寨生产队担任支部书记，通过细致的调查研究，找出了这个队的落后根子是耕地少、产量低，于是马上发动群众，认真贯彻多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针，千方百计扩大耕地面积，多种高产粮食作物，并且帮助这个队建立了一部分药材基地。当地缺乏优良品种，他就亲自攀高山、钻老林，步行到四川南坪，把调换的包谷、大豆、蚕豆和药材等良种运回来，鼓舞了群众的生产热情，播种工作从每天四十亩的进度上升到一百亩左右，为这个边远的穷队栽上了富根。武都平洛公社党委书记年生霖，把指挥部搬到了明月山，为了解决花崖沟水渠上的渡槽问题，他召开了“五仙会”（老农、技术员、干部、青年、妇女），在群众中找“巧匠”，结果找到共产党员张荣世和木匠张怀中，他们刻苦钻研，用土办法架起空中渡槽，使重点水利工程及时发挥了抗旱作用。
    深入到后进生产队和边远山区的干部，还和贫农、下中农交知心朋友，紧密团结当地干部，埋头苦干，克服困难，彻底改造落后面貌，促进各项工作迅速发展。徽成、西礼、文县、天水市干部深入阴湿山区后，发现少数干部和群众有“干旱收阴山，今年一定能多打粮”的麻痹思想，对秋田作物田间管理抓得不紧。他们就立即组织社员们讨论，纠正了麻痹情绪，开展了锄草、追肥活动。各地干部深入基层后，根据农事大忙形势，帮助基层干部合理安排了劳力，用压、缩、抽、调等办法，把70％到80％的劳力，投入农业生产第一线。
    深入第一线的干部，认真贯彻执行了中共天水地委的决定，根据陇南地区公社一般较大，居住分散的特点和前一时期推行“二五制”的经验，各县、社和大队积极实行了“三七制”的领导方法，即每旬前三天学习、开会、安排工作，后七天深入生产第一线，参加生产，领导生产。每天早上转，中午干，晚上帮，切切实实帮助基层干部解决问题。在三天集中学习和布置工作的时间中，保证有一天的学习时间。每次集中的地点、参加的人和讨论题目，由县、社党委、大队总支事先安排，通知有关人员。除了专题研究外，一般干部集中在社、队进行学习，检查布置工作。同时，县、社级机关在公社、生产队工作的干部每月集中一次到县参加“三七制”活动，总结、研究、安排本部门工作。因此，带动了许多农村不脱产的支部书记和大队干部一起参加了“三七制”的活动，使生产和学习互相促进，立竿见影。徽成县福德公社党委组织干部学习了甘肃日报“具体问题具体分析”的社论，对有些生产队收麦进度缓慢的问题进行了具体分析，发现是劳动组织不当，马上组织了收、打、晒、运、过秤、入库等各种专业队，确定了责任制，使收麦进度加快了一倍半。
