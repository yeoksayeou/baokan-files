To promote commune-run industry to serve agricultural production more closely, the Jianshanba Commune in Shuicheng County, Guizhou Province, in the movement of industry supporting agriculture, established "Worker-Peasant Combination Experimental Fields" to more closely integrate commune-run industry with agriculture and better serve agricultural production. Since its establishment last year, this experimental field has played a very good role in promoting the improvement of agricultural production materials production by commune-run industry, better supporting the technological transformation of agriculture, and promoting the tool reform movement throughout the commune. It is a new development of the cadre experimental field and a new creation in the movement of industry supporting agriculture.

The commune-run industry in Jianshanba Commune, which directly serves agricultural production, has already made considerable achievements in supporting agriculture in the past, producing many new types of agricultural machinery and fertilizers. Last year, the commune party committee conducted an in-depth inspection of the production of commune-run industries and found that some of the products of these factories were out of touch with actual production needs, and the masses were unwilling to use them, resulting in some backlogs. After analysis, the main reason was found to be that these products had not been evaluated by the masses during the trial manufacturing process. Therefore, some were rough, imperfect, or unsuitable, and not accepted by the masses. On the other hand, the masses' unfamiliarity with using them was also a reason. At the same time, it was also learned that some products had been tested and evaluated by the masses, and then sold quickly. After research, the commune party committee decided from the first half of last year that the commune's technical innovation committee would lead the effort, allocating fifty-one mu of land to establish "Worker-Peasant Combination Experimental Fields." In addition, seventeen management districts also planted one hundred and twenty-six mu, forming a "Worker-Peasant Combination Experimental Field" network. This "Worker-Peasant Combination Experimental Field" has fields and land, high mountains and plains, alkaline soil and acidic soil, which is representative of the area. Participants in the management include the commune party committee secretary, the party branch secretaries and factory directors of commune-run factories and mines, as well as fitters, blacksmiths, carpenters, and members of production teams. Its method of operation is: The commune party committee puts forward the goals and requirements for reforming agricultural tools according to production needs. The commune technical innovation committee then fully and carefully discusses and studies them, proposes models and drawings, and hands them over to the operators of the "experimental field" for trial production and research. The technical innovation committee immediately sends the new agricultural tools with good experimental results and decided to be promoted to the contracting factory, and the industry, agriculture, and commerce jointly formulate production and marketing plans and sign production and marketing contracts before the factory mass produces them.

After more than a year, the "Worker-Peasant Combination Experimental Field" has played a significant role in guiding commune-run industries to support agriculture. First, through the "experimental field," the farm tool factory has mastered the production characteristics of each management area in each season, and understands the cultivation requirements of various terrains and soils, so it can schedule in a timely manner, match production to needs, formulate production plans, and rationally arrange labor, equipment, raw materials, and so on. In terms of fertilizer manufacturing, the pesticide factory has also formulated different seasonal production ratios for the main fertilizers nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and pesticides according to the growth characteristics of crops in each season: such as winter 5, 2, 2, 1 (that is, nitrogen accounts for 50%, phosphorus accounts for 20%, potassium accounts for 20%, and pesticides account for 10%, and so on below), spring 4, 2, 3, 1, summer 5, 3, 1, 1, autumn 6, 2, 1, 1. This makes production and needs roughly adapt, avoiding disconnection between production and use.

Through the "Worker-Peasant Combination Experimental Field," whether a product and product specifications are suitable is determined in the trial manufacturing stage, so there are no more detours. For example, the currently used weeding rake was originally promoted from other places. After two on-site "consultations," a total of three problems were raised: First, the rake is put on both hands, and people have to bend over to operate it, and their hands can't bear it, and the labor intensity is high; second, the weeding quality is not high, the grass is not weeded clean, and the weeds cannot be pressed into the mud; third, it is too wide and cannot be used in dense fields. After discussion and research, great improvements were made: First, it was changed to a standing-waist and bending-waist dual-purpose type; second, wooden wheels were added behind the rake teeth to press the weeds into the mud; third, the specifications were changed to three and a half inches, three inches, and two and a half inches. After this improvement, the farm tool factory produced and sold more than 3,000 pieces, and the management area also produced more than 2,000 pieces, making each piece suitable. Since the beginning of this year, there have been more than ten kinds of farm tools that have been "consulted" in this way, and the products are very popular among the masses.

Since the "Worker-Peasant Combination Experimental Field" uses all new-style tools and fertilizers, the experimental field has become a garden for farmers to learn and experiment with new technologies. For example, the Liquiao team had four mu of acidic soil, and originally planting potatoes suffered from "autumn wind" and only yielded 500 jin. After being converted into a "Worker-Peasant Combination Experimental Field," new-style agricultural tools were used to deeply cultivate more than one foot, and fertilizers were applied, resulting in a high yield of 12,500 jin per mu of potatoes; another five mu of "Worker-Peasant Combination Experimental Field" was planted with second-crop seedlings and planted twenty days later than ordinary fields, but one week after planting the seedlings, 120 jin of nitrogenous hydrogen nitrate produced by the fertilizer factory was applied per mu, and then 4 kilograms of self-made ammonium chloride was applied per mu for the second time, and the crops grew better than the surrounding ones. The farmers praised and said: "The Worker-Peasant Combination Experimental Field" is really well planted, one field is worth two fields.

### 促进社办工业更紧密为农业生产服务  尖山坝公社大搞“工农结合试验田”

    促进社办工业更紧密为农业生产服务
    尖山坝公社大搞“工农结合试验田”
    本报讯　贵州水城县尖山坝公社在工业支援农业的运动中，为了使社办工业更密切地与农业结合，更好地为农业生产服务，创办了“工农结合试验田”。这种试验田从去年创办以来，在推动社办工业改进农业生产资料的生产，更好地支援农业的技术改造方面，在促进全社的工具改革运动方面，都起到了很好的作用。它是干部试验田的一个新发展，是工业支援农业运动中的一个新创造。
    尖山坝公社直接为农业生产服务的社办工业，过去在支援农业的工作中，已经做出不少成绩，生产了许多新式农业机具和化肥。去年，公社党委深入检查了社办工业的生产，发现这些厂的部分产品和实际生产需要脱节，群众不愿使用，造成某些积压现象。经过分析，找出了主要的原因是这些产品在试验制造过程中，没有经过广大群众鉴定，因此，有的粗糙不完善或不适用，不为群众所接受。另一方面群众不习惯使用也是一个原因。同时也了解到有些产品群众动手做过试验鉴定，便销售很快。公社党委经过研究后，从去年上半年起，就决定由公社技术革新委员会领导，划拨五十一亩田土，创办了“工农结合试验田”，另外，十七个管理区也种了一百二十六亩，形成了“工农结合试验田”网。这个“工农结合试验田”，有田有土，有高山有平坝，有碱性土壤也有酸性土壤，具有地方代表性。参加经营的有公社党委书记、社办厂矿的支书、厂长，还有钳工、锻工、木工等和生产队的社员。它的活动方法是：公社党委根据生产需要，提出革新农具的奋斗目标和要求。社技术革新委员会就充分细致地讨论和研究，提出模型和图纸，交给“试验田”的经营者试制研究。技术革新委员会对试验效果好、决定推广的新农具即时送交承包厂，由工农商三对面制定产销计划、签订产销合同，然后，工厂才大批制造。
    经过一年多时间，“工农结合试验田”在指导社办工业支援农业的活动中，起到了很大作用。首先是通过“试验田”农具厂掌握了各管理区各个季节的生产特点，了解各种地势、土壤的耕作要求，就按时排队、对口算账，制定生产计划，并合理安排劳力、设备、原材料等等。在化肥制造方面，农药厂也根据农作物在各个季节的生长特点，对主要的化肥氮、磷、钾和农药，制定了不同季节的生产比例：如冬五、二、二、一（即氮占50％、磷占20％、钾占20％、药占10％，以下类推），春四、二、三、一，夏五、三、一、一，秋六、二、一、一。这就使生产和需要大体相适应，避免生产使用脱节。
    通过“工农结合试验田”，一种产品和产品规格是否适用，就在试验制造阶段肯定，再不走弯路。如目前使用的薅秧耙，原来是推广外地的，经过两次实地“会诊”，共提出三点毛病：一是耙套在双手上，人要弯腰操作，手也吃不消，劳动强度大；二是薅秧质量不高，草薅不净，杂草压不到泥下；三是过于宽，密度大的田用不上。经过讨论研究，作了很大改进：一改为伸腰、弯腰两用式；二在耙齿后加木轮，以便把杂草压到泥下；三是规格改为三寸半、三寸、二寸半三种。经过这一改进，农具厂生产和推销了三千多件，管理区也生产了两千多件，做到件件合用。今年以来，像这种“会诊”过的农具就有十多种，产品都很受群众欢迎。
    由于“工农结合试验田”全部使用新式工具和化肥，试验田就成了农民学习和试验新技术的园地。如理桥小队有四亩偏土，原来种土豆遭“秋风”，只收五百斤。改作“工农结合试验田”后，用新式农具深耕一尺以上，并加施化肥，获得了土豆亩产一万二千五百斤的高产；另有五亩“工农结合试验田”虽是栽二道秧，并比一般田迟栽二十天，但在栽秧一星期后，用化肥厂造的氮酸氢每亩施一百二十斤，第二次又用自己造的氯化铵每亩施四公斤，庄稼比周围的长得好。农民们都赞扬地说：“工农结合试验田”硬是种得好，一田当两田。
