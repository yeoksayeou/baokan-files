Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 24th: Workers at the Huainan Coal Mine in Anhui Province have recently been discussing plans for increased production and thrift for the next four months, as well as measures to ensure the completion of these plans, while also launching a new labor emulation drive.

During the competition, each mine, district, team, and group has set competition targets based on actual production capacity, ensuring that everyone has a quota and that each team is evaluated daily, leading to a daily increase in production levels. Since the launch of the new competition, the coal output of the Li Yi Mine in mid-August increased by 5% compared to the first ten days of the month, and tunneling footage increased by 6%. After 47 groups in the Xie Er Mine launched a competition, output in the first half of August increased by more than 20% compared to the same period in July.

From January to July, the coal output of the Huainan Coal Mine increased by 25% compared to the same period last year. Recently, the Huainan Mining Area Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Party committees of each mine analyzed the current coal production situation and decided to concentrate efforts on improving the production capacity of existing coal mining faces and increasing new production capacity in order to produce more coal for steel production enterprises and push the increase production and thrift campaign to a new high. To this end, they will universally promote the effective regular multi-cycle operation experience in existing working faces to accelerate coal mining progress; strengthen the maintenance and repair of hydraulic coal mining to ensure normal production; develop new coal mining faces in batches; and launch a crash program to build several pairs of small coal mines. In order to achieve these goals, the mining area Party committee and the Party committees of each mine decided that, in addition to strengthening the political and ideological education of workers, they must first strengthen production preparation and accelerate tunnel excavation. Secondly, they must improve the management and supply of materials, equipment, and spare parts, and adjust equipment such as chain conveyors, belt conveyors, electric drills, and pneumatic drills within the enterprise through reasonable adjustments and warehouse cleanup to equip ten new coal mining faces and twenty new tunneling heads. At the same time, they will step up the manufacture of mechanical equipment spare parts and do a good job in machine maintenance to ensure normal production. Thirdly, they will adjust labor organization and transfer a group of people to replenish the front lines of mining. Fourthly, leading cadres will continue to go deep into the front lines of production to implement various measures and help workers solve key production problems; at the same time, they will strictly implement the seven systems, including the worker post responsibility system, the engineering specification quality inspection and acceptance system, the equipment maintenance and spare parts management system, the on-site handover system, the accident analysis and handling system, and the waste product recovery system, to ensure the continuous leap forward in production.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 24th: Workers at the Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau have formulated effective measures and launched an increase production and thrift campaign centered on improving coal output and quality and ensuring increased steel production.

The Xishan Mining Bureau Party Committee convened a meeting of cadres above the level of mine and pit captains and group leaders on August 19 to summarize the production achievements of the first seven months of this year and discuss the production plan for the next four months and specific measures to achieve the plan. Through the summary, the workers clarified the current excellent situation and the favorable conditions for completing the annual plan. Since July, the Mining Bureau Party Committee has transferred more than 3,400 laborers by adjusting labor organization and other methods to strengthen the front lines of mining, thereby increasing the number of new mining faces by more than 60% compared to June. Coal output in August soared, with output in the first ten days of the month increasing by 12% compared to the same period in July, and output in the middle ten days of the month increasing by another 12% compared to the first ten days of the month; coal quality has also improved significantly.

Based on the analysis of the current favorable production situation, the Mining Bureau Party Committee formulated an increase production and thrift plan and measures for the next four months, deciding: First, to further expand mining capacity and add thirteen more tunneling teams and two more mining faces by the end of August to prepare for greater production increases in September and the fourth quarter. Second, to mobilize workers to sort out, review, identify, and promote technological innovation projects, and currently focus on promoting eleven decisive innovation projects such as coal mining machine and chute management. Third, to further strengthen the maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment, eliminate major accidents, and reduce minor accidents. Strengthen grassroots political and ideological work, production leadership, and enterprise management to ensure a continuous leap forward in production.

In recent days, workers in all shifts and groups in the bureau have generally discussed and formulated specific plans and measures to complete the annual production tasks. Leading cadres at all levels of the Baijiazhuang Coal Mine have gone deep into the production groups to help workers come up with ideas and find solutions. They have identified the major and minor key issues in production and assigned these issues to each group and individual to solve. In just two days, they solved 53 problems, increasing the output of raw coal from each pit mouth by 12%. Workers in many pits have launched a series of competitions and head-to-head competitions between pits, teams, groups, and individuals. Personnel from functional departments have successively gone deep into the pits and established comprehensive offices to solve specific problems in production more promptly. (Attached picture)

    淮南煤矿、西山煤矿展开增产节约劳动竞赛
    人人定计划　为钢铁增产多采煤
    新华社合肥24日电　安徽淮南煤矿职工近来一面讨论今后四个多月的增产节约计划和保证完成计划的措施，一面开展了新的劳动竞赛。
    在竞赛中，各矿、区、队、班、组都根据实际生产能力，层层订出了竞赛指标，做到人人有定额，班班评比、日日评比；使生产水平天天上升。李一矿自开展新的竞赛以来，8月中旬的煤产量比上旬提高5％，掘进进尺提高6％。谢二矿四十七个小组开展竞赛以后，使8月上半月的产量比7月同期提高20％以上。
    淮南煤矿1至7月份的煤产量，比去年同期增长25％。最近，中共淮南矿区委员会和各矿党委分析了当前的煤炭生产情况，决定集中力量提高现有采煤工作面的生产能力，增加新的生产能力，以增产更多的煤炭供应钢铁生产企业，把增产节约运动推向高潮。为此，要在现有工作面普遍推行行之有效的正规多循环作业经验，加快采煤进度；水力采煤加强维护检修，保证正常生产；分批开拓新的采煤工作面；突击建设几对小煤井。为了实现这些目标，矿区党委和各矿党委决定除了加强对职工的政治思想教育以外，首先要加强生产准备工作，加快巷道掘进。其次，做好材料、设备、备件的管理和供应工作，用合理调整、清理仓库等办法，在企业内部调整出装备十个新采煤工作面和二十个新掘进头用的链板机、皮带运输机、电钻、风钻等机械设备，同时加紧制造机械设备备件，做好机器维护工作，保证生产正常进行。第三，调整劳动组织，抽调一批人员充实采掘第一线。第四，领导干部继续深入生产第一线，贯彻各项措施，帮助工人切实解决生产关键问题；同时严格贯彻执行工人岗位责任制，工程规格质量检查验收制，设备检修维护和备件管理制，现场交接班制，事故分析处理制，废品回收制等七项制度，保证生产持续跃进。
    新华社太原24日电　太原西山矿务局职工，订出有效措施，开展了以提高煤炭产量质量、保证钢铁增产为中心的增产节约运动。
    西山矿务局党委在8月19日召开了各矿、坑队长和小组长以上干部会议，总结了今年头七个月的生产成就，讨论了今后四个多月的生产计划和实现计划的具体措施。职工们通过总结，明确了当前的大好形势和完成全年计划的有利条件。从7月份以来，矿务局党委通过调整劳动组织等办法，抽调了三千四百多名劳力，加强了采掘第一线，从而使新的回采工作面比6月份增加了60％以上。8月份的煤炭产量便扶摇直上，上旬产量比7月同期提高了12％，中旬产量又比上旬提高12％；煤炭质量也有显著提高。
    在分析当前生产有利形势的基础上，矿务局党委拟订了今后四个月的增产节约计划和措施。决定：一，进一步扩大采掘能力，到8月底再增加十三个掘进组和二个回采工作面，为9月份和第四季度的更大增产作好准备。二，发动职工整理、审查、鉴定和推广技术革新项目，目前首先集中力量推行攉煤机、溜子管理等十一种带有决定性的革新项目。三，进一步加强机电设备维修工作，消灭大事故，减少小事故。加强基层的政治思想工作、生产领导和企业管理，保证生产持续跃进。
    连日来，全局各班组职工都普遍讨论和制定完成全年生产任务的具体计划和措施。白家庄煤矿各级领导干部深入生产小组，帮助工人出主意，想办法。他们摸清了生产上的大小关键，并把这些问题落实到各组和个人来解决，仅仅经过二天就解决了五十三个问题，使各坑口的原煤产量增加了12％。许多坑的职工已经展开了坑与坑，队与队，组与组，人与人之间的连环赛、对手赛。职能科室人员纷纷深入坑内，建立起综合办公室，更及时地解决生产中的具体问题。（附图片）
