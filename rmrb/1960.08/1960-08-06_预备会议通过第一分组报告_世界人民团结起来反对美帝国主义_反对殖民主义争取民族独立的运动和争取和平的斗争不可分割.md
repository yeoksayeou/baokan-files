Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 5th: The preparatory meeting for the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament passed the report of the first group discussion on the 4th. The report calls on the people of all countries in the world to unite, resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialism that is implementing policies of aggression and war, and jointly struggle to defend world peace and strive for national independence.

The report emphasizes: At present, "although the forces of peace are dominant, the conspiracies and aggressive actions of the imperialist countries that are deliberately pursuing the Cold War continue. As they are increasingly in a desperate situation, they are taking blatant provocative actions to undermine the cause of peace and intensify world tensions."

The report states that when the world's attention was focused on the summit conference and expected successful negotiations on world peace, the incident of sending a U-2 type aircraft over Soviet territory showed the world that the United States was adopting double-dealing tactics. This incident made the true nature of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" even more clearly exposed. Moreover, contrary to the intentions of the U.S. aggressive war clique, this has prompted the people's movement to oppose it more strongly. In addition, American intervention in Cuba and the Congo is the most recent testament to modern imperialism and colonialism.

The report exposed the crimes of the United States in establishing nuclear bases and preparing for atomic warfare in South Korea, South Vietnam, Okinawa, Japan, Taiwan, and West Germany.

The report says, "Belgian colonialists, supported by the United States and other colonial countries, are doing everything possible to divide the Congo, separating Katanga Province in order to maintain their control over the Congo's uranium mines and other resources."

The report then says that the war is still going on in Algeria. The de Gaulle government's refusal to negotiate a solution with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria on the basis of Algerian self-determination has aroused worldwide anger.

"The U.S. intervention in Cuba and the reiteration of the Monroe Doctrine demonstrate that Latin America is considered its own exclusive sphere of influence, thereby justifying any form of intervention in the region."

The report says, "We are making every effort to mobilize the broad masses of people to fight for the realization of general disarmament." "We demand a cessation of all nuclear weapon tests and resolutely oppose and condemn the U.S. government's attempt to resume testing. Based on the current negotiations in Geneva and the measures already agreed upon, we call on the people of all countries to intensify their efforts to successfully conclude an agreement to permanently ban nuclear testing."

"We demand the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in Asia, the Pacific region, and Central Europe, and demand that the countries of the Asia-Pacific region conclude a treaty of non-aggression."

"We demand the abolition of the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' which aims to revive Japanese militarism. We call on the people of Asian countries and the peace forces of the world to unite closely with the Japanese people for this purpose. It is important to recognize and resist the provocative and dangerous role of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, and other military alliances implemented by imperialist countries in Asia, and to recognize the implications of the U.S.-Japan Treaty and the military preparations in South Vietnam and West Irian—an inseparable part of Indonesia—all of which are part of this strategy.

"We demand a halt to the flight of aircraft carrying nuclear weapons and a halt to all espionage flights.

"We demand the restoration of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations Organization."

The report emphasizes, "We believe that the movement to ban nuclear weapons, to strive for general disarmament, to oppose the deprivation of people's rights, to oppose foreign bases, to oppose colonialism, and to strive for national sovereignty and independence is an inseparable part of the struggle of the people of the world for peace.

"We demand that an end be put to all repressive measures taken against those who are fighting for peace, especially against those who participate in the Japanese people's struggle against the 'Security Treaty,' against the persecution of people fighting for peace in the Federal Republic of Germany, South Korea, South Vietnam, Central and South Africa, the United States, and many other countries. In this regard, we would like to make special mention of Kenyatta of Kenya, and we demand his immediate release.

We fully support the demands of the Japanese people, based on their constitution renouncing war, for peace and national neutrality."

The report concludes: "We call on the people of all countries in the world to do everything in their power to overwhelm all evil attempts, to prevent actions that exacerbate tensions, and to create a favorable atmosphere for the resumption of summit talks.

"We demand the immediate reunification of Korea and Vietnam, which have been artificially divided.

"We demand the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two Germanys on one side and the countries that participated in World War II on the other.

"We demand that the U.S. imperialists withdraw from Taiwan—an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China. We demand that the United States withdraw from Okinawa and return Okinawa to Japan.

"We call on the people of all countries in the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa, to unite closely in the struggle to strive for disarmament, independence, and peace."

    预备会议通过第一分组报告
    世界人民团结起来反对美帝国主义
    反对殖民主义争取民族独立的运动和争取和平的斗争不可分割
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会预备会议4日通过了第一分组讨论结果报告。报告呼吁全世界各国人民团结起来，坚决反对执行侵略和战争政策的美帝国主义，为保卫世界和平和争取民族独立而共同斗争。
    报告强调指出：目前“尽管和平力量占优势、一意进行冷战的帝国主义国家的阴谋和侵略行动在继续进行。由于它们日益处于绝望的境地，它们正在采取露骨的挑衅行动来破坏和平事业和加剧世界紧张局势。”
    报告说，当全世界的视线集中在最高级会议上并期望有关世界和平的谈判取得成功的时候，派遣U—2型飞机飞越苏联领土上空的这件事向全世界表明，美国采取两面手法。这次事件使美日“安全条约”的真正性质更加清楚地暴露出来。不仅如此，同美国侵略战争集团的意图相反，这也促使人民运动更强烈地反对它。此外，美国对古巴和刚果的干涉，是现代帝国主义和殖民主义的最近的见证。
    报告揭露了美国在南朝鲜、越南南方、冲绳、日本、台湾、西德建立核基地和准备原子战争的罪行。
    报告说，“得到美国和其它殖民国家支持的比利时殖民主义者，正在千方百计分割刚果，把加丹加省分裂出去，以保持他们对刚果的铀矿和其它富源的控制。”
    报告接着说，战争还在阿尔及利亚继续进行着。戴高乐政府拒绝在阿尔及利亚自决的基础上同阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府谈判解决办法，这激起了全世界的愤怒。
    “美国对古巴的干涉和重申门罗主义这些做法表明，拉丁美洲被认为是它独自霸占的势力范围，借此来为它在这个地区进行任何形式的干涉辩解。”
    报告说：“我们竭力动员广大人民群众来为争取实现全面裁军而奋斗”。“我们要求停止一切核武器试验，坚决反对和谴责美国政府要恢复试验的企图。在目前在日内瓦进行的谈判和迄今已经达成协议的措施的基础上，我们要求各国人民加紧努力争取成功地缔结永远禁止核试验的协议”。
    “我们要求在亚洲、太平洋地区和中欧建立无原子武器区，要求亚洲—太平洋地区国家缔结互不侵犯条约。
    “我们要求废除旨在复活日本军国主义的日美‘安全条约’。我们呼吁亚洲各国人民和全世界和平力量为此同日本人民紧密团结起来。重要的是认识和反抗东南亚条约组织、中央条约组织和帝国主义国家在亚洲付诸实施的其它军事联盟的挑衅的和危险作用，并认识日美条约及在越南南方和西伊里安——印度尼西亚不可分割的一部分——的军事准备的含义，这一切都是这个策略的组成部分。
    “我们要求停止带有核武器的飞机的飞行，停止一切间谍飞行。
    “我们要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国组织中的合法地位。”
    报告强调说，“我们认为，争取禁止核武器、争取全面裁军、反对剥夺人民的权利、反对外国基地、反对殖民主义、争取民族主权和独立的运动，是全世界人民争取和平的斗争的不可分割的一部分。
    “我们要求制止对为争取和平而斗争的人们采取的各种镇压措施，特别是对参加日本人民反对‘安全条约’的斗争的人们，对在德意志联邦共和国、南朝鲜、越南南方、中非和南非、美国和其它许多国家为争取和平的人们的迫害，在这方面我们要特别提到怯尼亚的肯雅塔，我们要求立即释放他。
    我们完全支持以自己的放弃战争的宪法为根据而争取和平和国家中立的日本人民的要求。”
    报告最后说：“我们号召全世界各国人民竭尽全力来压倒一切罪恶的企图，防止加剧紧张局势的行动，为恢复最高级会谈创造有利的气氛。
    “我们要求立即重新统一被人为地分裂的朝鲜和越南这些国家。
    “我们要求两个德国为一方和参加第二次世界大战的各国为另一方之间缔结和约。
    “我们要求美帝国主义者撤出台湾——中华人民共和国不可分割的一部分。我们要求美国撤出冲绳岛，并把冲绳岛归还日本。
    “我们要求全世界各国人民，特别是亚非各国人民在竭力争取实现裁军、独立和和平的斗争中紧密地团结起来。”
