    Tianjin Water Pump Factory's Production Level More Than Doubles
    (Our Dispatch) The Tianjin Water Pump Manufacturing Factory has rapidly grown and strengthened by supporting agricultural production, developing from being able to produce only simple small-sized water pumps to being able to produce new types of large-sized water pumps. In April of this year, the city launched a vigorous upsurge of supporting agriculture and combating drought. All staff and workers actively participated in this movement. From April to June, the factory produced a total of 300 water pumps for agricultural use. The production level increased by more than double compared to the fastest-growing fourth quarter of last year, and labor productivity also increased by 71%.
    Through supporting agriculture, not only has the factory's production level greatly increased, but its technical level has also rapidly improved. It has shifted from producing medium and small-sized water pumps to beginning trial production and production of new types of water pumps that save power, have large pumping volume, and are lightweight.
    This factory has also armed itself in the process of supporting agricultural production. All staff and workers have brought into play the spirit of "poor sticks" making revolution, relying on their own efforts, combining indigenous and foreign methods, making and modifying seventeen machines, equivalent to one-third of the factory's original machinery and equipment, breaking through the bottleneck of insufficient equipment in some processes.
    In the past, some people in this factory believed: "Producing water pumps for agricultural use will not improve technology and will affect the factory's development and growth." The factory's Party branch launched a mass airing of views, a mass debate, on the question of "Can industry supporting agriculture improve technology and can it develop and grow?", and also organized staff and workers to visit rural areas in rotation. Through study and visits, the staff and workers realized the great significance of industry supporting agriculture, tried every means to tap production potential, and launched a production upsurge to support agriculture. They said: "As long as it is work related to 'agriculture,' we will complete it no matter how difficult it is." The production efficiency of all production teams in the factory has generally increased by more than double, powerfully supporting agricultural technological transformation.

    挖掘潜力支援农业
    天津水泵一厂生产水平增长一倍多
    本报讯　天津水泵制造一厂通过支援农业生产，迅速地成长壮大，从原来只能生产简单的小型水泵，发展到能够生产新型的大型水泵。今年4月份，全市掀起了支援农业抗旱的热潮。全体职工积极地参加这个运动，4月至6月三个月中，全厂共生产了农业用水泵三百台，生产水平比去年发展最快的第四季度还增长了一倍多，劳动生产率也提高了71％。
    通过支援农业，这个厂不但生产水平有了很大增长，而且技术水平也迅速提高，由生产中、小型水泵，开始试制和生产省动力、抽水量大、体积轻的新型水泵。
    这个厂还在支援农业生产过程中武装了自己。全厂职工发挥了“穷棒子”闹革命的精神，自力更生，土洋结合，制成和改装了十七台机器，相当于全厂原有机器设备的三分之一，突破了有些工序设备力量不足的关键。
    这个厂过去有些人认为：“生产农业用的水泵，技术提不高，影响厂子发展壮大”。工厂党支部就“工业支援农业能不能提高技术，能不能发展壮大”这一问题，发动职工开展大鸣大放大辩论，并且组织职工轮流到农村参观访问。经过学习和访问，职工们认识到工业支援农业的重大意义，千方百计地挖掘生产潜力，掀起了支援农业的生产高潮。他们说：“只要沾‘农’字的活，有多大困难，我们也要完成。”全厂所有的生产小组的生产效率普遍提高了一倍以上，有力地支援了农业技术改造。
