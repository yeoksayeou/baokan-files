Spaceship Completes Scientific Exploration Program

Data Obtained Is Currently Being Sorted and Comprehensively Studied

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 23rd. TASS Moscow, August 22nd, telegram: TASS Communiqué

The first animals in history to return to Earth after a flight through outer space were delivered to Moscow on August 21, 1960.

As previously reported, the Soviet Union's second satellite spaceship carried the dogs "Little Arrow" and "Squirrel." In addition to them, forty mice, two rats, insects, plants, seeds of gramineous plants, and certain microorganisms were carried to study the effects of radiation and space flight conditions.

Thirteen experimental white mice and fifteen black mice, as well as two large white rats, completed the flight in the satellite spaceship's cabin. In the ejected container, in addition to "Squirrel" and "Little Arrow," there were also six white and six black mice, insects—fruit flies—packaged in fifteen flasks, plants—Tradescantia—packaged in two flasks, Chlorella—in a suspension state—packaged in eight ampoules filled with liquid nutrient, and Chlorella—on four agar slants—packaged in ampoules, fungal cultures—actinomycetes—packaged in fourteen ampoules, and some different varieties of corn and wheat seeds, peas, onions, and black cumin.

In addition, the container also carried small pieces of human skin and rabbit skin, packaged in two ampoules; HeLa cancer cells, packaged in six ampoules; microorganisms—"KK-12" type Escherichia coli, packaged in eleven ampoules, type B Escherichia coli, packaged in six ampoules, "aerogenes" type Escherichia coli, packaged in four ampoules, oleic acid fermenting bacilli, packaged in two ampoules, staphylococcus, packaged in two ampoules, deoxyribonucleic acid, packaged in six ampoules, "T-2" type bacteriophage, packaged in three ampoules, and "one three - two one" type bacteriophage, packaged in three ampoules.

For scientific research, the following instruments were also installed on the spaceship for the following purposes:

    To study the light and heavy atomic nuclei in primary cosmic radiation;
    To study the X-rays and ultraviolet rays of the sun;
    To record the intensity (dose) of cosmic radiation in the animal container.

The spaceship carried some thick-layered nuclear photographic emulsion blocks with a total weight of approximately sixty kilograms, and one of these photographic emulsion blocks was designated to be directly developed on the spaceship.

Scientific intelligence was recorded and transmitted back to the ground according to command. The recorded intelligence was transmitted back to the ground once after each orbit around the Earth, and once before landing.

In addition, during the descent process, the physiological data of the experimental animals were continuously recorded by an automatic control recording system installed on the spaceship.

The nuclear photographic emulsion blocks and all instruments for scientific exploration returned to the ground with the spaceship.

The television system installed on the satellite spaceship provided much valuable intelligence in the form of films. The film records are highly accurately synchronized with the telemetry records, making it possible to compare direct observations of the animals with objective data on changes in their physiological functions transmitted back to the ground using the telemetry system.

Supplementary calculations of the orbital elements of the second Soviet satellite spaceship confirmed that its flight consistently followed a trajectory extremely close to the calculated one.

Accurate calculations of the different factors affecting the spaceship's operation and descent, continuous processing of the spaceship's orbital element measurements using electronic computers, and calculation of the orbit, as previously reported, enabled the spaceship to achieve a highly accurate landing.

During the descent and after landing of the spaceship and the container ejected from the spaceship, specialized radio transmitters installed in the spaceship and the container emitted radio signals. This made it possible to continuously orient and track the position of the spaceship and the container, all the way to the landing site.

All animals and organisms are currently in good condition.

The plan for scientific exploration and measurement has been completed. The data obtained is currently being sorted and comprehensively studied.

    塔斯社发表公报
    宇宙飞船完成了科学考察计划
    目前正在整理和全面研究所获得的资料
    新华社23日讯　塔斯社莫斯科22日电：塔斯社公报
    历史上第一批经过宇宙空间的飞行后返回地球的动物，已在1960年8月21日送到莫斯科。
    前已报道，在苏联第二个卫星式宇宙飞船上有小狗“小箭”和“松鼠”。除了它们以外，为了研究辐射和宇宙飞行条件的影响，还载有四十只小鼠和两只大鼠、昆虫、植物、禾本科植物籽粒和某些微生物。
    在卫星式飞船舱里完成飞行的有十三只实验用小白鼠和十五只小黑鼠以及两个大白鼠。在被弹射出来的容器中，除了“松鼠”和“小箭”以外，还有六只白色的和六只黑色的小鼠，分装在十五个烧瓶中的昆虫——果蝇，分装在两个烧瓶中的植物——紫鸭跖草，以悬浮液状态分装在八个盛有液态营养质的安瓿中和分装在四个琼脂斜面的安瓿中的植物——小球藻，分装在十四安瓿中的真菌类作物——放线菌，一些不同品种的玉米和小麦种籽、豌豆、葱和黑种草。
  此外，在容器中还载有分装在两安瓿中的一些小块的人的皮肤和兔的皮肤，分装在六安瓿中的赫拉癌细胞；微生物——分装在十一安瓿中的“KK—12”型大肠杆菌，分装在六安瓿中的B型大肠杆菌，分装在四个安瓿中的“产气”型大肠杆菌，分装在二安瓿中的油—酸发酵杆菌，分装在二安瓿中的葡萄球菌，分装在六个安瓿中的脱氧核酸，分装在三安瓿中的“T—2”型噬菌体和分装在三安瓿中的“一三——二一”型噬菌体。
    为了进行科学研究，在宇宙飞船上还装有下列用途的仪器：
    研究初级宇宙辐射中的轻、重原子核；
    研究太阳的X射线和紫外线；
    记录动物容器中的宇宙辐射强度（剂量）。
    在飞船上带有一些总重约六十公斤的厚层原子核照相乳胶块，而且这些照相乳胶块中有一块是规定直接在飞船上进行照相乳胶显影的。
    科学情报被记录下来并按照命令发回地面。飞船每围绕地球运行一圈之后向地面发回一次被记录下来的情报，着陆前也发回了一次情报。
    此外，在下降过程中，试验动物生理数据用装在飞船上的自动操纵记录系统不间断地记载下来。
    原子核照相乳胶块及所有科学考察用的仪器都随飞船回到了地面。
    装在卫星式飞船上的电视系统提供了许多以影片形式摄下来的珍贵情报。影片记录同遥测情报记录是高度精确地同步的，这样，就有可能把对动物的直接观察同利用遥测系统发回地面的关于它们生理机能变化的客观数据加以对比。
    对第二个苏联卫星式飞船的轨道要素进行的补充计算证实，它的飞行始终是沿着与计算极为接近的轨道进行的。
    对于影响宇宙飞船的运行和下降的不同因素的准确计算，用电子计算机对飞船的轨道要素测量结果的不间断的整理及对轨道的计算，正像以前报道的那样，使飞船高度准确地实现了降落。
    在宇宙飞船和从飞船上弹射出来的容器下降期间和着陆以后，装置在飞船和容器内的专门无线电发射机发射了无线电讯号。这样就能够不间断地对飞船和容器的位置进行定向，并实现对飞船的追踪，一直追踪到着陆的地点。
    所有动物和生物体目前状况都很好。
    科学考察和测量的计划已经完成。所获得的资料目前正在整理和全面地研究。
