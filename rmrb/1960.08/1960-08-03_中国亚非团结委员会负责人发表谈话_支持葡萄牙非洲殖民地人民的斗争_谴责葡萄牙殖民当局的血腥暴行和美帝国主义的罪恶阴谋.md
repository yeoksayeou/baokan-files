Xinhua News Agency, 2nd August. The head of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee issued a statement today on "Day of Support for the People of Portuguese Colonies," saying that the Chinese people deeply sympathize with and resolutely support the just struggle of the people in Portuguese African colonies against colonialism and for national independence, and extend their heartfelt respect to the people in these regions.

The head of the committee said that Portuguese colonialists have long carried out cruel exploitation and enslavement of the people of Angola, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, and other African colonies ruled by Portugal, and have suppressed the national independence movements of the people in these regions with extreme barbarity. For centuries, under the dark rule of Portuguese colonialists, more than ten million Africans have lived as slaves worse than cattle and horses on their own land. All patriotic organizations have been banned, and large numbers of patriots have been massacred or imprisoned. Recently, with the support of the US-led imperialist bloc, Portuguese fascist colonialists have also sent additional troops to Angola and other Portuguese African colonies to carry out a frenzied suppression of the local people in order to maintain their colonial rule. US imperialism, while acting as an accomplice of the Portuguese colonialists, helping the Portuguese authorities to suppress the African people through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is also stepping up its infiltration into Portuguese African colonies in all aspects, carrying out large-scale plunder, and plotting to eventually replace the Portuguese colonialists in dominating and enslaving the people of these regions.

The head of the committee said that the broad masses of the people in the Portuguese African colonies, regardless of the most barbaric massacres by the colonialists, have continuously launched heroic resistance and persisted in their struggle for independence and freedom. Recently, with the rapid development of national independence movements in various parts of Africa, especially under the encouragement of the patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese people against the Belgian armed aggression, the people in the Angolan region are arming themselves to fight, which has greatly alarmed the Portuguese colonialists and imperialists.

The head of the committee pointed out that the struggle of the people in the Portuguese African colonies has won the respect and support of the people of Asia and Africa who are fighting against colonialism. The 650 million Chinese people resolutely stand with the people of the Portuguese African colonies and solemnly condemn the Portuguese colonialist's bloody suppression of the people of Angola and other Portuguese African colonies. We firmly demand that the Portuguese colonialists immediately stop all massacres and persecutions of the people in these regions, immediately release all arrested patriots, and rescind unjust trials. Portuguese colonialists and all imperialist forces must get out of all African colonies ruled by Portugal.

The head of the committee concluded by saying that the Chinese people believe that in today's world, with the rapid collapse of the imperialist colonial system and the unprecedented strength of the people of the world, the people of Angola and other Portuguese African colonies, with the joint support of the people of Asia and Africa and the people of the world, as long as they unite, persist in their struggle, and are vigilant and crush all the conspiracies of US-led imperialism, they will surely end the heinous colonial rule and achieve the final victory of national independence and freedom.

    中国亚非团结委员会负责人发表谈话
    支持葡萄牙非洲殖民地人民的斗争
    谴责葡萄牙殖民当局的血腥暴行和美帝国主义的罪恶阴谋
    新华社2日讯　中国亚非团结委员会负责人今天就“支持葡萄牙殖民地人民日”发表谈话说，中国人民深切同情和坚决支持葡萄牙非洲殖民地人民为反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的正义斗争，并向这些地区的人民表示衷心的敬意。
    这位负责人说，葡萄牙殖民主义者对安哥拉、莫三鼻给、葡属几内亚和葡萄牙所统治的其它非洲殖民地人民，长期进行着残酷的剥削和奴役，极其野蛮地镇压这些地区的人民的民族独立运动。几世纪以来，在葡萄牙殖民者的黑暗统治下，一千多万非洲人，在自己的土地上过着牛马不如的奴隶生活，一切爱国组织都遭到禁止，大批的爱国者被屠杀或关进监狱。最近，在美国为首的帝国主义集团支持下，葡萄牙法西斯殖民主义者，还增派军队到安哥拉和其它葡萄牙非洲殖民地，对当地人民进行疯狂的镇压，以维持其殖民统治。美帝国主义一面充当葡萄牙殖民者的帮凶，通过北大西洋公约组织帮助葡萄牙当局镇压非洲人民，一面加紧从各方面渗入葡萄牙非洲殖民地，大量进行掠夺，阴谋最后替代葡萄牙殖民者地位，统治和奴役这些地区的人民。
    负责人说，葡萄牙非洲殖民地的广大人民，不顾殖民主义者最野蛮的屠杀，不断掀起英勇的反抗，为争取独立和自由而坚持斗争。最近，在非洲各地民族独立运动迅速发展，特别是在刚果人民反抗比利时武装侵略的爱国正义斗争的鼓舞下，安哥拉地区的人民正纷纷武装起来进行斗争，使葡萄牙殖民主义者和帝国主义者非常惊恐。
    负责人指出，葡萄牙非洲殖民地人民的斗争，得到了亚洲和非洲为反对殖民主义而斗争的人民的尊敬和支持。六亿五千万中国人民，坚决和葡萄牙非洲殖民地人民站在一起，严正谴责葡萄牙殖民主义对安哥拉和葡萄牙其它非洲殖民地人民的血腥镇压。我们坚决要求葡萄牙殖民主义者，立即停止对这些地区人民的一切屠杀和迫害，立即释放一切被逮捕的爱国者并撤消不公正的审判，葡萄牙殖民主义者以及一切帝国主义势力都必须从葡萄牙统治的非洲各殖民地滚出去。
    这位负责人最后说，中国人民相信，在帝国主义殖民体系迅速崩溃和全世界人民的力量空前强大的今天，安哥拉和葡萄牙其它非洲殖民地人民，在亚非人民和世界人民的共同支援下，只要团结起来，坚持斗争，警惕和粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义的各种阴谋，就一定能结束万恶的殖民统治，从而取得民族独立和自由的最后胜利。
