Xinhua News Agency, August 13th—August 15th is the great festival of the 15th anniversary of Korean liberation. Li Yong鎬, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, held a press conference this morning to introduce the brilliant achievements made by Korea in the past fifteen years since its liberation to Chinese and foreign journalists.
	In his speech, Ambassador Li Yong鎬 said that Korean production is developing rapidly with the momentum of Chollima. Industrial production has been advancing at a high speed of 42% annual growth since the war. In 1959, it increased by 53%; the total value of industrial production plan for the first half of this year has been overfulfilled, an increase of 112% compared with the same period last year. In agricultural production, grain production in 1959 increased to 179% of that in 1946. The water conservancy in the countryside has been basically completed, and electrification has also made considerable achievements. More than 98% of all 里 (i.e., districts) in the northern half have been electrified. At present, agricultural mechanization is also being rapidly and comprehensively carried out. Cultural education and health undertakings have also greatly developed.
	Li Yong鎬 said that the people in the northern half of the Republic are living extremely happy lives under the socialist system. However, the people in the southern half are living in extreme hardship under the rule of US imperialism and its puppet regime. Three to four million farmers are now out of food. The South Korean people can no longer tolerate this cruel plunder. They have begun to deeply realize the root cause of this great suffering and have bravely risen up to wage a resolute and just struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs.
	Li Yong镐 said that in order to exercise their legitimate political rights, the South Korean people must force the withdrawal of the US imperialist aggressor troops from South Korea, conduct North-South general elections based on the true free will of the Korean people, and peacefully reunify the fatherland.
	Li Yong镐 finally emphasized that Korea is Korea of the Korean people. The Korean issue must be resolved by the Koreans themselves without any external interference. The root cause of all the misfortunes and disasters of the South Korean people and the obstacle to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue—the US imperialist aggressor troops—must be withdrawn from South Korea immediately.

    李永镐大使在讲话中说，朝鲜的生产正以千里马之势飞速发展。工业生产，在战后以每年增长42％的高速度前进。1959年，增长了53％；今年上半年的工业生产总值计划，已经超额完成，与去年同期相比，增长到112％。农业生产，1959年粮食增长为1946年的179％，农村的水利化已经基本完成，电气化也取得了不小的成绩，北半部所有里（即区）的98％以上都已通了电。目前，农业机械化也在迅速全面开展。文化教育、卫生事业也有很大的发展。
    李永镐说，共和国北半部的人民在社会主义制度下，过着极其幸福的生活。可是，南半部的人民，在美帝国主义及其傀儡政权的统治下，生活极为困苦，现在有三百万到四百万的农民已经断粮。南朝鲜人民已经再也不能忍受这种残酷的掠夺，他们已经开始深刻认识到这种巨大苦难的祸根是什么，英勇地起来同美帝国主义及其走狗进行坚决的正义斗争。
    李永镐说，南朝鲜人民要行使正当的政治权利，就必须迫使美帝国主义侵略军队撤出南朝鲜，根据朝鲜人民真正的自由意志进行南北普选，和平统一祖国。
    李永镐最后强调指出，朝鲜，是朝鲜人民的朝鲜。朝鲜问题必须不受任何外部干涉，由朝鲜人自己解决。南朝鲜人民一切不幸和灾难的根源、朝鲜问题和平解决的障碍——美帝国主义侵略军队，必须立即从南朝鲜撤出去。（附图片）
