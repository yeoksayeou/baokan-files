    Rationally Arrange Labor Force with Agriculture as the Center
    ——An Investigation of Labor Management Issues in Dongjiafang People’s Commune, Huailai County	Collective Writing by Hebei Daily Reporter and Correspondents from Various Counties (Districts) in Zhangjiakou City
    Dongjiafang People's Commune in Huailai County, Hebei Province, is a commune with a relatively good foundation in Zhangjiakou City. The entire commune has eight management districts, thirty-one accounting units, 10,236 households, 32,750 people, and 162,540 mu of cultivated land, averaging 4.9 mu of cultivated land per person.
    Since 1958, this commune has supported large-scale industrial production with 3,364 laborers. The current allocation of labor is: 10,380 laborers engaged in agriculture, accounting for more than 70% of the total labor force, with each laborer responsible for more than 15 mu of cultivated land; converting auxiliary labor into full labor, the average full labor force is responsible for more than 23 mu of cultivated land.
    In the past two years, the commune's production has achieved high-speed development. In 1958 and 1959, it sold 19.1 million jin of surplus grain, 30,000 jin of oil crops, and nearly 1 million jin of industrial mats, paper-making raw materials, etc. to the state. Although it encountered an extraordinary drought this year, crops are growing vigorously due to careful field management. The commune-run industry has also greatly developed, with a total output value of more than 110,000 yuan in the first half of the year.
    Recently, we conducted an investigation into the labor management work of this commune, which can be used as a reference for various regions.
      Guarantee the Labor Needed for Agriculture
    In order to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, Dongjiafang People's Commune conducted an investigation into the use of rural labor in the winter of last year and the spring of this year, and comprehensively arranged the rural labor force. Any undertakings that are closely related to agricultural production throughout the year (such as farm tool repair and assembly plants, fertilizer plants, and grain and feed processing plants) must be resolutely established and managed well. During the busy farming season, those that are not closely related to agricultural production should be slowed down, delegated, or suspended. After classification and overall rectification, both the labor required for agriculture and the support needed for agriculture in various aspects were guaranteed.
    When arranging production, 81 factories and groups, including hairdressing, catering, bathhouses, shoe repair, and seal carving, which were not closely related to agricultural production, were delegated to the production teams, totaling 589 laborers. The production teams flexibly managed them and carried out business according to the busy and slack seasons of farming. Some businesses stopped operating during the busy farming season. These welfare undertakings are more convenient for the masses and increase mobile forces for agricultural production than when they were concentrated in the commune. The members said with satisfaction: This method is "win-win." For example, when rushing to eliminate weeds during the summer hoeing season, the laborers in these industries participated. Factories like the saltpeter plant, which did not have a direct relationship with production, were shut down. The professional theater troupe was delegated to the production teams and became an amateur troupe, participating in all production activities.
    After rectification, of the 14,809 male and female laborers in the entire commune, more than 70% were engaged in agricultural production; 3.3% were engaged in commune-run industry; more than 5% were engaged in life service industries and transportation; 8.3% were engaged in forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy construction; 5.8% were engaged in collective life welfare undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly; 0.8% were engaged in cultural, educational, and health undertakings; 1% were engaged in finance and trade; and 5% were engaged in other aspects.
    For capital construction, the methods of suspending operations during the busy farming season, preparing for battle during the less busy season, and launching surprise attacks during the slack season were adopted. During the slack farming season last winter and this spring, more than 1,300 strong laborers were concentrated to complete six canal earthwork projects with a total length of 254,000 meters and a total of 80,800 cubic meters, built 149 branch, capillary, and bucket canals, and installed 36 li of underground pipelines, expanding the irrigated area by a total of 15,002 mu. All were completed by the busy farming season, and they played a role in this year's drought resistance struggle. In sideline production, the methods of large-scale efforts during the slack season and small-scale efforts during the less busy season were also adopted. Only a few sideline productions are carried out throughout the year, so that sideline production does not compete with agricultural production for labor. For example, in the entire commune's sideline industries, the weaving industry, which accounted for the most labor, once reached more than 2,000 people during the slack season, and only a few auxiliary laborers were left during the busy farming season, which ensured a bumper harvest in both agriculture and sideline industries. Last year, the income from sideline production reached more than 820,000 yuan, accounting for more than 30% of the total income of the entire commune.
    Digging Up Labor Potential in Many Ways
    After rational arrangement, the entire commune ensured that more than 70% of the labor force participated in agricultural production, but this was still far from the labor required for increased agricultural production. This year, the entire commune planted more than 162,000 mu of various crops. According to the requirements for increasing production of various crops, 2,565,000 labor days are required. Together with the labor for capital construction, a total of 2,816,500 labor days are required. However, the entire commune invested 10,380 full and half laborers and auxiliary laborers in agricultural production. Calculating that the entire labor force averages 275 working days per person per year, with each person doing 0.65 labor days per day, the entire labor force can only complete more than 1,855,000 labor days. That is to say, the labor days that the existing labor force can complete are 961,000 fewer than the labor days required to achieve the production increase task.
    Under such circumstances, the majority of people firmly believe that relying on the superiority of the People's Commune and giving full play to the collective wisdom and strength, it is possible to meet the needs of production by digging up labor potential in many ways. A few people could not see the strength of the masses and attempted to solve the problem of insufficient labor by lowering production targets. The Commune Party Committee adhered to the road of the promoter faction and criticized the fear of difficulties. On the basis of unified thinking, the potential of labor was tapped from four aspects.
    First, carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, and vigorously carrying out tool reform, is an important aspect of solving the problem of insufficient labor. Judging from the effect of tool reform in this commune, in terms of agricultural tools, 33 deep plows have been successfully trial-produced and produced. This kind of deep plow is operated by one person and pulled by two animal powers. It can cultivate five mu of land a day, with a depth of about one foot, which is equivalent to the workload of 25 laborers manually deep turning the land with shovels. Calculated according to 60 days of use throughout the year, it can increase more than 47,000 labor days for the commune. The successfully trial-produced corn threshing machine has produced 23 units. Each unit is operated by three people and can thresh 10,000 jin a day. On average, each person threshes more than 3,300 jin of corn per day, which is ten times higher than the efficiency of one laborer threshing 300 jin in the past. This year, the entire commune planted 25,143 mu of corn, and it is estimated that 10,057,200 jin of corn can be produced. Using the threshing machine can save 30,477 labor days. In terms of grain processing, the 75 production teams in the entire commune have realized power, and grain processing alone can save 261 laborers and 285 animal powers every day, which will increase 94,265 labor days and 103,025 animal labor days for the commune throughout the year. Calculating only the above three items, tool reform this year can increase more than 171,000 labor days and a large part of animal power.
    Second, tap the labor potential of women. According to the principle of convenience for the masses and flexibility and diversity, the commune rectified and consolidated collective life welfare organizations and social service industries. The entire commune has 74 kindergartens, 455 nursery groups, 252 public canteens, and 84 sewing factories, groups, and laundry groups, liberating more than 3,200 female full and half laborers. They have generally learned agricultural work such as land preparation, sowing, and weeding. After many women improved their agricultural production technology, they have changed from the original auxiliary labor force to the main force on the agricultural production front.
    Third, organize auxiliary labor to participate in production. In the past, the commune and team cadres of this commune believed that auxiliary labor could not do much work, and many tasks suitable for auxiliary labor in agricultural production were done by full labor. Practice has proved that auxiliary labor can play a significant role. The group led by Zhang Mingxian in the 30th team of Dongjiafang team only had 11 young adults on the attendance book in the past. After tapping the auxiliary labor force, the number of people who regularly attend reached 37, which is more than double the number of people who attended originally. The various production teams in the entire commune universally adopted the method of lining up households and individuals one by one, assigning light and sporadic work to the auxiliary labor force, and freeing up strong labor to do heavy work. In this way, the entire commune has a total of 1,311 auxiliary laborers. If four people are converted into one full labor force, calculated according to 275 days of attendance throughout the year, more than 82,000 labor days can be increased.
    Fourth, organize non-agricultural labor to participate in agricultural production. The office cadres, factory workers, school teachers and students, and non-production personnel in various industries in this commune are all required to participate in agricultural production. The full-time cadres of the commune, management district and other departments implement a system of working and studying for half a day and laboring for half a day for half a month each month throughout the year. During the busy farming season, they all work and study for half a day and labor for half a day. Units such as the "Four Modernizations" Middle School and the fertilizer plant have been assigned production tasks of contracting planting, contracting management, contracting output, and contracting to the end throughout the year. During the tense moment of rushing to eliminate weeds during the summer hoeing season, the entire commune organized 3,842 non-agricultural production personnel to rush to eliminate weeds, and completed the first weeding ten days ahead of schedule.
    In addition, production teams also cooperate and support each other according to the different levels of busy and slack farming work.
    Mobilize the Labor Enthusiasm of Commune Members
    This commune pays great attention to improving the labor enthusiasm of commune members in its daily work. The first is to strengthen the political and ideological education of commune members. Starting last winter, in conjunction with socialist education, a mass debate was launched on the issue of taking agriculture as the foundation. Through airing views and debates, the vast number of cadres and commune members deeply realized that: if agricultural production cannot develop at a high speed, it will affect the great leap forward in all aspects; only the great development of agriculture can promote the high-speed development of industry, culture, education, finance and trade and other aspects faster and better, and accelerate the change of rural areas.
    Timely distribution is an important task to mobilize the labor enthusiasm of commune members. Dongjiafang People's Commune emphasized the following three aspects in the 1959 distribution: First, appropriately arrange the retention ratio and reduce non-productive expenditures. According to the investigation of Dongjiafang and Xia Hulu production brigades, the retention ratio last year was: production investment (including seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, pesticides, livestock, agricultural tax, etc.), public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, production management fee and other deductions accounted for 45% of the total income, and the pure distribution part of commune members accounted for 55% of the total income. The result of the distribution was: 90% of households increased their income compared with 1958; 6.3% of households did not increase or decrease, and the decrease in income only accounted for 3.7% of the total number of households. The production teams made arrangements for the households with reduced income separately, so that their income was no lower than that of ordinary households. Second, implement the policy of distribution according to work. The various production teams in the entire commune have mostly adopted the labor management system of "three guarantees," "one reward," fixed-work production, quota management, and small contracting, so that commune members who work more and have higher efficiency receive the labor remuneration they deserve. According to the investigation of Dongjiafang production brigade, each strong laborer works 250 to 300 labor days throughout the year, each medium laborer works more than 200 labor days, and weak laborers also work about 100 labor days. In addition, production teams with good labor and more production also received over-production rewards; commune members with good ideology and good labor were not only commended, but also received bonuses. Fourteen production teams in Dongjiafang and Xia Hulu production brigades received over-production rewards, and 148 "five-good" commune members with good ideology, good labor, good savings, good obedience to leadership, and good care for the collective were commended and materially rewarded. Third, do a good job of small pre-distribution, so that commune members constantly have pocket money. The vast majority of commune members in this commune have made long-term plans to live frugally, and save the money they cannot spend temporarily in credit cooperatives. According to the investigation of Xia Hulu and Dongjiafang production brigades, 2,674 commune members have deposits in credit cooperatives, accounting for 77% of the total number of commune members.
    This commune also attaches great importance to organizing the lives of commune members. Their method of grasping life is: secretaries at all levels enter the canteen, politics enters the canteen, and cadres at all levels are responsible for the canteen; the annual grain consumption target is handed over to the masses, who manage it themselves and manage it democratically. In this way, the leaders have a clear understanding, and the masses have a clear understanding. The masses arrange their monthly consumption according to the annual grain consumption target, eating less during slack times and more during busy times. The masses not only eat their fill and eat well, but also save grain. Some production teams have made proper arrangements for grain consumption for weddings, funerals, childbirth, and other events. The lives of commune members are well arranged, with work and leisure, which promotes production and further strengthens the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation among the vast number of commune members.
    Reasonable work calculation is an important link in improving labor efficiency. In terms of work calculation, Dongjiafang People's Commune can be roughly divided into three types: The first type is to evaluate labor points according to the strength of the labor force and record work by area, which is unreasonable and cannot promote the improvement of labor efficiency and ensure the quality of agricultural work. At present, only a few production teams do this. The second type is small contracting. This method can mobilize people's labor enthusiasm, but it is sometimes easy to ignore the quality of agricultural work. The third type is the system of combining "determining work by person" and "determining work by agricultural work." This method not only mobilizes the labor enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members, but also improves labor efficiency and ensures the quality of agricultural work. This method is currently being actively promoted.
    The method of combining "determining work by person" and "determining work by agricultural work" is a method of strengthening the labor management of individual commune members by the production team on the basis of "three guarantees" and "one reward." "Determining work by person" is to adopt the method of self-reporting and public discussion to formulate individual monthly and annual work plans according to the different strengths of the labor force. The method of "determining work by agricultural work" is to divide various agricultural work into three types according to the conditions of operation and management such as the weight, difficulty, distance of the land, the level of technology, mountainous land, and flat land, as well as whether the masses have habits: for all agricultural work that the masses have been accustomed to in the past, such as building dikes, digging canals, delivering manure, and harvesting, fixed quotas are set for the year; for all agricultural work that the masses have temporarily contracted in the past, such as land preparation and weeding, small fixed quotas are set; for agricultural work that the masses are not accustomed to, such as replanting and other sporadic chores, only work points are set and no quotas are set. After the quotas are set for each agricultural work, they are flexibly managed according to the method of arranging long-term and revising short-term. Long-term arrangement is to set the labor standards per mu of each crop in each stage of spring sowing, summer hoeing, and autumn harvest according to the crop growth process and management measures and production indicators. Make temporary revisions to the changes caused by climatic and other conditions of various crops to ensure that the quotas are reasonable and the commune members are satisfied.
      After "determining work by person" and "determining work by agricultural work" are formulated by the masses through discussion, the agricultural work is contracted to the production team, with responsibility assigned to individuals, and the "four determinations" are implemented: determine the plot of land, determine the work points, determine the time, and determine the quality. Combine with the monthly or bi-monthly love-the-commune inspection day to conduct inspections and evaluations. Those who exceed the quota and ensure quality will be rewarded with 25% of the excess part in addition to recording points according to the quota and their own labor grade; those who fail to complete the task but have no certain reason will be criticized and educated. After the responsibility is assigned to individuals, carry out hand-in-hand competitions, insert red flags widely, establish models widely, and commend advanced people. With advanced labor organizations and advanced management systems, it is also necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen the political and ideological education of commune members, and constantly improve socialist and communist consciousness, so that labor enthusiasm can become higher and higher and more and more solid.
    After implementing the quota management method of combining "determining work by person" and "determining work by agricultural work," the labor enthusiasm of commune members has been mobilized, and labor efficiency has been greatly improved. The number of people attending work in the entire commune has increased from 8,000 to more than 10,000, and the attendance rate has reached 96%. The Dongbao production team, which originally felt that the labor force was not enough, not only had enough labor after implementing the labor quota, but also supported other teams.
      There is still a lot of labor potential
    After adopting these methods, has the labor potential of this commune been fully exploited? No, after investigation and research, there is still a lot of potential to be tapped. Take the canteen as an example. At present, the average cook in the entire commune cooks for 51 people, while the cooks in the Qian'erling production team's canteen cook for an average of 83 people. If the workload of the cooks in the entire commune reaches a ratio of 1 to 83 after the reform of cooking utensils, then more than 200 laborers can be released. In terms of animal husbandry, this commune mainly raises pigs. At present, the average feeder in the entire commune feeds 16 pigs. The 41st team of Dongjiafang production brigade, which has the highest pig raising rate, has two male half laborers, each feeding an average of 41 pigs. If the workload of the feeders in the entire commune reaches a ratio of 1 to 41, calculated according to the current 7,308 pigs raised in the entire commune, 278 laborers can be released.
    Through tool reform and tapping labor potential, the problem of insufficient labor can not only be solved, but also various crops can be managed more carefully on the basis of the original production increase plan and production increase measures, so as to achieve higher production increase requirements.

    以农业为中心合理摆布劳动力
    ——怀来县董家房人民公社劳动管理问题的调查	河北日报记者、张家口市各县（区）通讯干事集体采写
    河北怀来县董家房公社是张家口市工作基础较好的一个公社。全社八个管理区，三十一个核算单位，一万零二百三十六户，三万二千七百五十人，耕地十六万二千五百四十亩，平均每人占有耕地四点九亩。
    1958年以来，这个公社支援大工业生产劳动力三千三百六十四人。现有劳力的分配是：从事农业的劳动力一万零三百八十人，占总劳力70％以上，每个劳力负担十五亩多耕地；把辅助劳力折合成整劳力，平均每个整劳动力负担耕地二十三亩多。
    两年来，这个公社的生产获得了高速度发展。1958、1959年卖给国家余粮一千九百一十万斤，油料三万斤，工业用席、造纸原料等近百万斤；今年虽然遇到了特大干旱，由于田间管理精细，作物生长茁壮。社营工业也有很大发展，上半年生产总值达十一万多元。
    最近我们就这个公社的劳动管理工作进行了调查，可供各地参考。
      保证农业所需劳力
    为贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针，董家房人民公社在去冬今春对农村劳力的使用进行了调查，全面安排了农村劳动力。凡是常年与农业生产有紧密关系（如农具修配厂、化肥厂、粮食饲料加工厂等）的事业就坚决办下来，而且要办好；农忙季节与农业生产关系不大的，该缓办的缓办，该下放的下放，该停办的停办。经过分类排队，全面整顿，既保证了农业所需的劳力；也保证了农业所需要的各方面的支援。
    在安排生产时，把和农业生产关系不大的理发、饮食、澡堂、钉鞋、图章等八十一个厂、组，共五百八十九名劳动力，下放到生产队，由生产队灵活掌握，根据农活忙闲情况开展业务，有些业务在农忙时停止经营。这些生活福利事业，比集中在公社时，更便利群众，也为农业生产增加了机动力量。社员们满意地说：这么办是“两全其美”。比如在夏锄突击灭草荒时，这些行业的劳动力都参加了。对生产没有直接关系的如火硝厂停工了。职业剧团下放到生产队，变成业余剧团，全部参加生产。
    经过整顿，全公社一万四千八百零九个男女劳动力，农业生产占用70％以上；社办工业占用3.3％；生活服务行业和交通运输业占用5％以上；林业、牧业和水利建设占用8.3％；食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院等集体生活福利事业占用5.8％；文教卫生事业占用0.8％；财贸金融占用1％；其他方面占用5％。
    对于基本建设，采取了农忙时停办、小忙时备战、农闲时搞突击战的办法。去冬今春的农闲季节，曾集中一千三百多名壮劳动力，突击完成了六条全长二十五万四千米、共计八万零八百立方米的渠道土方工程，修建了一百四十九条支、毛、斗渠，安装地下管道三十六华里，共计扩大浇地面积一万五千零二亩，到农忙时全部竣工，在今年抗旱斗争中发挥了效益。在副业生产上，也采取了农闲大搞，小忙小搞，只有少数副业生产常年搞，作到副业生产不与农业生产争用劳力。比如，全公社副业中占劳力最多的编织业，农闲季节曾达到两千多人，农忙时只剩下少数辅助劳动力，这就保证了农、副业双丰收。去年副业收入就达到八十二万多元，占全社总收入的30％以上。
    多方挖掘劳动潜力
    经过合理的摆布，全公社保证了70％以上的劳动力参加农业生产，但与农业增产的要求所需要的劳力还相差很远。今年全社播种各种农作物十六万二千多亩，按照各种不同作物增产的要求，需用工二百五十六万五千个劳动日，连同基本建设用工共需要二百八十一万六千五百个劳动日。而全社投入农业生产的整半劳动力和辅助劳力是一万零三百八十人，按全部劳动力全年平均每人出勤二百七十五天，每天每人做六分五厘劳动日来计算，全部劳动力只能完成一百八十五万五千多个劳动日。这就是说，现有的劳动力所能完成的劳动日，与实现增产任务所需要的劳动日相差九十六万一千多个。
    在这种情况下，多数人坚信依靠人民公社的优越性，发挥集体的智慧和力量，多方挖掘劳动潜力，是可以满足生产需要的。少数人看不见群众的力量，企图用降低生产指标来解决劳动力不足的问题。公社党委坚持了促进派的道路，批判了畏难情绪。在思想统一的基础上，从四个方面挖掘劳动潜力。
    第一，开展技术革新和技术革命，大搞工具改革，这是解决劳动力不足的一个重要方面。从这个社改革工具的效果看，在农具方面，已经试制成功并生产了三十三部深耕犁。这种深耕犁用一人操作，两个畜力牵引，一天能耕地五亩，深度在一尺左右，相当过去人力用锨深翻地的二十五个劳动力的工作量；按全年使用六十天计算，就可以为社里增加四万七千多个劳动日。试制成功的玉米脱粒机，已生产出二十三部，每部用三人操作，一天能脱粒一万斤，平均每人每天脱粒玉米三千三百多斤，较过去一个劳动力脱粒三百斤提高工效十倍。今年全社种植玉米二万五千一百四十三亩，估计可产玉米一千零五万七千二百斤，使用脱粒机可节省三万零四百七十七个劳动日。在粮食加工方面，全公社的七十五个生产小队已经实现了动力化，仅粮食加工一项，每日就可节省二百六十一个劳力和二百八十五个畜力，全年就为社里增加九万四千二百六十五个劳动日和十万三千零二十五个畜工。仅按以上三项计算，今年改革工具即可增加十七万一千多个劳动日和很大一部分畜力。
    第二，挖掘妇女劳动潜力。公社根据便利群众，灵活多样的原则，整顿、巩固了集体生活福利组织和社会服务行业。全社有幼儿园七十四所，托儿组四百五十五个，公共食堂二百五十二个，缝纫厂、组和洗衣组八十四个，解放出妇女整半劳力三千二百多名。她们普遍地学会了整地、播种、锄苗等农活，许多妇女提高农业生产技术以后，已经从原来的辅助劳力变成为农业生产战线上的主力军。
    第三，组织辅助劳力参加生产。过去，这个公社的社、队干部，认为辅助劳力干不了什么活，在农业生产上有许多适合辅助劳动力干的活却让整劳力去干。经过实践证明，辅助劳力能发挥很大作用。董家房队第三十小队张明先领导的小组，过去出勤簿上只有十一名青壮年，经过挖掘辅助劳动力，现在经常出勤的达到了三十七人，比原来出勤的人数增加两倍多。全公社各个生产队普遍采取逐户逐人排队，把轻活、零星活分配给辅助劳动力去干，腾出壮劳动力做重活。这样，全社共有一千三百十一个辅助劳动力，如按四个人折合为一个整劳动力，按全年出勤二百七十五天计算，就可以增加八万二千多个劳动日。
    第四，组织非农业劳动力参加农业生产。这个公社的机关干部、工厂职工、学校师生以及各行各业的非生产人员，都规定有参加农业生产的任务。公社、管理区等各个部门的脱产干部，推行全年每个月有半个月的时间半天工作学习、半天劳动，农活大忙时一律半天工作学习、半天劳动的制度。“四化”中学、化肥厂等单位，都分配了包种、包管、包产量，全年一包到底的生产任务。在突击夏锄灭草荒的紧张时刻，全公社组织三千八百四十二名非农业生产人员突击灭荒，提前十天锄完了头遍苗。
    此外，生产队之间，根据彼此农活忙闲程度的不同，也互相协作，互相支援。
    调动社员劳动积极性
    这个公社在日常工作中，很注意提高社员劳动积极性。首先是加强了对社员的政治思想教育工作。从去冬开始结合社会主义教育，对以农业为基础的问题，展开了全民性的大辩论。通过鸣放辩论，使广大干部和社员深刻地认识到：农业生产不能高速度的发展，就会影响各个方面的大跃进；只有农业的大发展，才能更快更好地促进工业、文教、财贸等各方面工作的高速度发展，才能加速改变农村面貌。
    及时作好分配，是调动社员劳动积极性的重要工作。董家房人民公社在1959年的分配中，强调了做好以下三方面的工作：第一，适当地安排扣留比例，减少非生产性的开支。据董家房、下葫芦两个生产大队的调查，去年的扣留比例是：生产投资（包括籽种、肥料、农具、农药、牲畜、农业税等）、公积金、公益金、生产管理费等几项扣除，占总收入的45％，社员纯分配部分占总收入的55％。分配的结果是：90％的户，较1958年增加了收入；6.3％户不增不减，减少收入的只占总户数的3.7％。对减少收入的户，各生产队都分别进行了安排，使他们的收入也不低于一般户。第二，贯彻执行按劳分配的政策。全公社各个生产队大都采取了“三包”、“一奖”和定工生产、定额管理以及小包工的劳动管理制度，使出勤多、工效高的社员得到了应有的劳动报酬。据董家房生产大队的调查，每个强劳动力全年做二百五十个到三百个劳动日，每个中等劳动力做二百个以上，弱劳动力也做了一百个左右。此外，劳动好、增产多的生产小队，还得了超产奖励；思想好、劳动好的社员，除受到表扬，还得了奖金。董家房、下葫芦两个生产大队，有十四个生产小队得到了超产奖励，有一百四十八名思想好、劳动好、节约好、服从领导好、爱护集体好的“五好”社员受到表扬和物质奖励。第三，做好小段预分，使社员手里不断零花钱。这个社的绝大部分社员都作出了勤俭过日子的长期打算，把暂时花不着的钱存到信用社里。据下葫芦、董家房两个生产大队的调查，在信用社有存款的社员二千六百七十四户，占社员总户数的77％。
    这个公社还十分重视组织社员生活。他们抓生活的办法是：各级书记进食堂，政治进食堂，层层干部包食堂；把全年吃粮指标交给群众，由群众自己掌握，民主管理。这样，领导心里有数，群众心里有底。群众按照全年吃粮指标，闲时少吃，忙时多吃，逐月进行安排。群众不仅吃的饱，吃的好，还节约了粮食。有的生产队对婚丧嫁娶、生育子女等用粮都做了妥善安排。社员生活安排的好，有劳有逸，促进了生产，也进一步坚定了广大社员以农业为基础的思想。
    合理计工，是提高劳动效率的一个重要环节。董家房人民公社，在计工方面，大体上可分为三种类型：第一种是根据劳动力强弱评定劳动工分，按晌记工，这是不合理的，不能促进提高劳动效率和保证农活质量。目前只有少数生产队这样作。第二种是小包工，这种办法能调动人们的劳动积极性，但有时容易忽视农活质量。第三种是“以人定工”和“以农活定工”相结合的制度，这种办法既调动了广大社员群众的劳动积极性，又提高了劳动效率，且保证农活质量。目前正在积极推行这种办法。
    “以人定工”和“以农活定工”相结合的办法，是在“三包”、“一奖”的基础上，加强生产小队对社员个人劳动管理的办法。“以人定工”是采取自报公议的办法，按照劳动力强弱的不同，订出个人每月和全年的出工计划。“以农活定工”的办法是，把各种农活按照轻重、难易、土地远近、技术性高低、山地、平地等经营管理条件，以及群众有无习惯等，分为三种类型：凡群众过去有习惯的农活，如打埂、挖渠、送粪、收割等，订出常年定额；凡是过去群众有临时包工习惯的，如整地、锄苗等，就搞小段定额；对群众不习惯的农活，如补种等零星杂活，只定工分不定额。各项农活制定出定额以后，按长安排短修订的方法灵活掌握。长安排是根据农作物生长过程和管理措施、生产指标，定出春播、夏锄、秋收等每一阶段、每种作物每亩地的用工标准。对各种作物因气候等条件引起的变化，进行临时修订，做到定额合理，社员满意。
      “以人定工”和“以农活定工”经群众讨论制定后，把农活包到生产小队，责任到人，实行“四定”：定地块、定工分、定时间、定质量。结合每半月一次的爱社检查日，进行检查评比，超额完成定额并且保证质量的，除超过部分按定额和本人的劳力等级记分外，再奖励超过部分的25％；对完不成任务但又没有一定理由的，进行批评教育。责任到人以后，开展了携手赛，大插红旗，广树标兵，表扬先进。有了先进的劳动组织，有了先进的管理制度，还必须坚持政治挂帅，加强对社员的政治思想教育，不断提高社会主义和共产主义觉悟，劳动积极性才能越来越高，越来越巩固。
    推行“以人定工”和“以农活定工”相结合的定额管理办法以后，调动了社员劳动积极性，大大提高了劳动效率。全公社出勤人数由八千人增到一万多人，出勤率达到96％。原来感到劳动力不够支配的东堡生产小队，执行劳动定额以后，不仅够用，还支援了其他队。
      劳动潜力仍然很大
    采用这些办法以后，这个公社的劳动潜力算挖尽了吗？没有，经过调查研究还有很大潜力可挖。就以食堂来说吧，目前全公社平均每个炊事员做五十一个人的饭，而千儿岭生产队食堂的炊事员，每人平均做到八十三个人的饭。如果经过炊具改革，全社炊事员的工作量都达到一比八十三，那么就可抽出劳力二百多人。在畜牧业方面，这社以养猪为主，目前全社平均一个饲养员喂养十六口猪，养猪率最高的董家房生产大队第四十一小队，两个男半劳力，平均每人喂养四十一口。如果全社饲养员的工作量都达到一比四十一，按现在全社喂养的七千三百零八口猪计算，即可抽出二百七十八个劳动力。
    通过工具改革，挖掘劳动潜力，劳动力不足的问题不但可以解决，而且还可以在原来增产计划、增产措施的基础上，把各种农作物管理的更加精细，达到更高的增产要求。
