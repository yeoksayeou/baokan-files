Uphold the Good Custom of "Four Togethers"
Wang Zhan'ao, First Secretary of the CCP Guangdong Dianbai County Committee

　　Learn from Ye Yang's good example,
　　Uphold the "Four Togethers" to create a good custom;
　　Work style greatly changed,
　　New atmosphere appears in production.
　　This folk song reflects the new scene that has emerged in Dianbai County as the broad masses of cadres have responded to the call of the CCP Guangdong Provincial Committee and launched a campaign to learn from Ye Yang, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Shishui Brigade in the Diancheng Commune of our county.
　　Cadres going deep among the masses, integrating with them, caring about their lives, and sharing weal and woe is the glorious tradition of our Party. The "Four Togethers" (eating together, living together, laboring together, and consulting together) is the inheritance and development of this fine style. Over the past few years, the vast majority of our cadres have adhered to and promoted the Party's fine style, and as the revolutionary cause has developed, they have continuously enriched it in different historical periods. Vigorously developing "experimental plots," setting up camps in the fields, cadres going down to the grassroots, and the institutionalization of cadres participating in labor are all further developments of the "Four Togethers." It is precisely because of this that the Party and the masses have always maintained a close relationship like fish and water, thus guaranteeing the victory of various revolutionary causes. Comrade Ye Yang, who has persisted in "Four Togethers" with the masses for ten years as one day, is a model for adhering to and carrying forward the Party's fine style. Anyone who has been to the Shishui Brigade of the Diancheng Commune in Dianbai County has a common feeling: here, the relationship between cadres and the masses, leaders and the led, and people, is a new type of comradely relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation. Cadres and the masses are as close as fish and water, and are intimate with each other. The commune members praise Ye Yang, the Party General Branch Secretary, as a good Party member and a good cadre taught by Chairman Mao. The masses are in high spirits, and production is doing very well. This area originally suffered a major drought, and there had been no thorough rain for more than nine months, but the early rice production of this brigade still achieved a great leap forward. Their experience proves that the implementation of "Four Togethers" between cadres and the masses is extremely helpful in maximizing the political enthusiasm and production initiative of the masses.
　　The essence of the "Four Togethers" is that cadres go deep among the masses, share weal and woe with them, integrate with them, and lead them forward together. We Communists and revolutionary cadres are the servants of the people, so we should have the spirit of sharing weal and woe with the people at all times. Every one of our Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres should stand among the masses, not outside the masses to lead them. To truly achieve this, we must go deep down, integrate with the masses, place ourselves among the masses in the posture of ordinary laborers, consult with the masses in case of trouble, and lead the masses forward. If we want to investigate and study, we must honestly go deep down, and only when we have no airs and no special treatment can the masses feel that you are one of them, and only then will they regard you as one of their own. Only at this time can you hear the true feelings of the masses, hear and discover problems that cannot be understood in the office, and more deeply implement the Party's policies and solve specific problems.
　　Combining the general with the individual, and combining leadership with the masses, are the two fundamental working methods taught to us by Chairman Mao. Going deep among the masses and "Four Togethers" with the masses is precisely the embodiment of specifically implementing these two fundamental methods. If we do not go deep down, and only have general appeals without specific guidance, such leadership is generalized. Only by walking out of the office and going deep among the masses can we grasp the situation more timely, more specifically, and more accurately through "dissecting sparrows," and break through one point to gain experience to guide the overall situation.
　　The purpose of cadres participating in production is also to lead production. As long as we are good at combining labor and work, it will not only not affect the work, but also be more conducive to leading the work. Because all our work ultimately is to lead the masses to do a good job in production and life, and the process of participating in labor together with the masses is essentially the process of leading the work. Especially after the implementation of the "two-five system" of leadership methods, production, work, and learning have been more properly and reasonably arranged.
　　Cadres going deep into the "Four Togethers" has not only promoted the current work, but also has the far-reaching significance that the ideological level and working ability of cadres have been greatly improved. The process of cadres participating in production and leading production is also the process of increasing production knowledge and enriching production experience. It not only tempers thinking, but also learns the ability to lead production, moves towards the path of unity of politics and technology, being both red and expert, and at the same time cultivates the style of strengthening ties with reality and following the mass line.
　　Countless facts prove that adhering to the "Four Togethers" and carrying forward the Party's fine style is not only a need for work, but also a long-term and important task in the Party's political and ideological construction. We must adhere to the "Four Togethers" as a permanent system, inherit the Party's glorious tradition, and further carry forward the Party's fine style.

### 坚持“四同”好风尚

    坚持“四同”好风尚
    中共广东电白县委第一书记　王占鳌
    学习叶养好榜样，
    坚持“四同”成风尚；
    工作作风大改变，
    生产出现新气象。
    这首民歌反映着电白县广大干部在响应中共广东省委号召，开展学习我县电城公社湿水大队党总支书记叶养运动以来出现的新景象。
    干部深入到群众中去，和群众打成一片，关心群众生活，同甘共苦，这是我们党的光荣传统。“四同”（同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量）是这种优良作风的继承和发扬。几年来，我们绝大多数干部都坚持和发扬着党的优良作风，而且随着革命事业的发展，在各个不同的历史时期，又不断地加以发展充实。大搞“试验田”，田头安营扎寨，干部下放基层，干部参加劳动制度化等等，这些都是四同的进一步发展。正因为这样，使党和群众始终保持着鱼水般的密切联系，因而保证了各项革命事业的胜利。坚持十年如一日和群众“四同”的叶养同志，正是坚持和发扬党的优良作风的榜样。到过电白县电城公社湿水大队的人，都有一个共同的感觉：在这里，干部与群众，领导与被领导，人与人之间，完全是一种新型的同志式的互助合作的关系。干部群众水乳交融，亲密无间，社员们赞扬大队党总支书记叶养是毛主席教导出来的好党员好干部，群众情绪很高，生产搞得非常出色。这里本来遭受大旱灾，九个多月未下过透雨，但这个大队早造生产仍实现了大跃进。他们的经验证明：干部与群众实行“四同”，极其有助于最大限度地发挥群众的政治热情和生产积极性。
    “四同”的实质就是干部深入群众，和群众同甘共苦，和群众打成一片，并带动群众一起前进。我们共产党员、革命干部是人民的勤务员，因此，在任何时候都应该具有和人民群众同甘共苦的精神。我们每个共产党员、革命干部，都应该是站在群众之中，而不是站在群众之外去领导群众。要真正做到这一点，也就必须深入下去，和群众打成一片，以普通劳动者的姿态置身于群众之中，遇事和群众商量，并带领群众前进。我们要调查研究，就要老老实实地深入下去，而且只有做到没有半点架子，没有半点特殊，群众才会感到你是他们中间的一员，才会把你看成自己人，也只有在这个时候，你才能听到群众的真心话，才能听到和发现在办公室所不能了解到的问题，才能更深入地贯彻党的方针政策，解决具体问题。
    一般和个别相结合，领导和群众相结合，这是毛主席教导我们的两个根本的工作方法。深入群众，和群众“四同”，正是具体贯彻这两个根本方法的体现。如果我们不深入下去，只有一般号召，没有具体的指导，这样的领导就是一般化。只有走出办公室，深入群众中去，才能通过“解剖麻雀”，更及时、更具体、更准确地掌握情况，并突破一点，取得经验以指导全面。
    干部参加生产的目的，也是为了领导生产。只要善于把劳动和工作扭在一起，这样就不仅不会影响工作，而且更有利于领导工作。因为我们一切工作归根到底是领导群众搞好生产、搞好生活的工作，和群众一起参加劳动的过程，实质上也就是领导工作的过程。特别是推行“二五制”的领导方法以后，生产、工作、学习就得到了更妥善合理的安排。
    干部深入“四同”，不仅推动了当前工作，更具有深远意义的是干部思想水平和工作能力有了很大提高。干部参加生产领导生产的过程，也就是增加生产知识、丰富生产经验的过程。既锻炼了思想，又学会了领导生产的本领，走向政治与技术统一的又红又专的道路，同时培养了加强联系实际、走群众路线的作风。
    无数的事实证明，坚持“四同”，发扬党的优良作风，这不仅是工作的需要，也是党的政治思想建设上一项长期的重要任务。我们一定要把“四同”作为永久的制度坚持下去，继承党的光荣传统，进一步发扬党的优良作风。
