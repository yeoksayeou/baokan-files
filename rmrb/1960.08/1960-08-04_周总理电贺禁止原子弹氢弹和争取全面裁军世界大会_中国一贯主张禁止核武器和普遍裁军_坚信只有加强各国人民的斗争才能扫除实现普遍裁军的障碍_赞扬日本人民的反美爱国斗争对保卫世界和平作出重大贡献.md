Xinhua News Agency, 3rd - Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China sent a telegram on July 30 to the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Complete Disarmament, congratulating the conference on its success. The text of the telegram is as follows:
    To the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Complete Disarmament:
    On the occasion of the convening of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Complete Disarmament, I would like to extend my greetings on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and in my own name, to the hosts of the conference—the Japanese people and the friends from all countries participating in this conference, and to express my warm congratulations to the conference.
    For more than a decade, the Japanese people have waged unyielding struggles against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and for the prohibition of nuclear weapons. This struggle of the Japanese people has made a significant contribution to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. At present, the Japanese people are launching a nationwide struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agents, with the opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty as its core, and it is in full swing. I, on behalf of the Chinese people, once again express my heartfelt admiration and resolute support to the Japanese people who are fighting bravely for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.
    The prohibition of nuclear weapons and complete disarmament are the common aspirations of the people of the world, and also the consistent position of the Chinese government and the Chinese people. The Chinese government and the Chinese people have made a series of sincere efforts for this. We have repeatedly proposed that all countries in the Asian and Pacific region conclude a treaty of mutual non-aggression and make this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone. We fully support the initiatives and actions of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries regarding disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons. We firmly believe that only by strengthening and relying on the resolute struggle of the people of all countries can we remove the obstacles to achieving the prohibition of nuclear weapons and complete disarmament. The Chinese people will, as always, adhere to this conviction, and together with the Japanese people, together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, together with all peace-loving people and countries in the world, resolutely oppose the war and aggression policies of U.S. imperialism, strive to achieve the prohibition of nuclear weapons and complete disarmament, and fight to the end to safeguard world peace.
    I wish the conference success!
                            Zhou Enlai
                            Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China
                                         July 30, 1960

    新华社3日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来7月30日致电第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会，祝贺大会成功。电文如下：第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会：
    在第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会召开之际，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人的名义，向大会的主人——日本人民和参加这次大会的各国朋友们致意，并且向大会表示热烈的祝贺。
    十几年来，日本人民为反对美帝国主义的侵略，为争取禁止核武器，进行了不屈不挠的斗争。日本人民的这一斗争，对保卫亚洲和世界的和平，作出了重大的贡献。目前，日本人民正以反对美日军事同盟条约为核心，如火如荼地展开了一个反对美帝国主义和它的代理人的全民性斗争。我代表中国人民再一次向为争取独立、民主、和平、中立而进行英勇斗争的日本人民，表示衷心的敬佩和坚决的支持。
    禁止核武器和普遍裁军是全世界人民的共同愿望，也是中国政府和中国人民的一贯主张。中国政府和中国人民曾经为此作出了一系列的真诚努力。我们一再建议亚洲和太平洋地区的一切国家缔结一个互不侵犯的和平公约，并且使这个地区成为无核子武器区。我们全力支持苏联和其他社会主义国家关于对裁军和禁止核武器的倡议和行动。我们坚信，只有加强和依靠各国人民的坚决斗争，才能扫除实现禁止核武器和普遍裁军的障碍。中国人民将始终不渝地本着这种信念，同日本人民一起，同苏联和其他社会主义国家一起，同全世界爱好和平的人民和国家一起，为坚决反对美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，为争取实现禁止核武器和普遍裁军，为维护世界和平而斗争到底。
    祝大会成功！
                            中华人民共和国国务院总理　周恩来
                                         1960年7月30日
