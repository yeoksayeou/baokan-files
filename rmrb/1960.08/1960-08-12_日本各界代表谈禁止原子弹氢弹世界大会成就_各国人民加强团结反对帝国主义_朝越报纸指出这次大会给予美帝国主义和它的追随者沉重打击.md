Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Tokyo: Many Japanese representatives who attended the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament unanimously pointed out, when talking to Japanese reporters about their impressions of the conference, that the most important achievement of this world conference was the strengthening of international unity among the people of various countries in their common struggle against imperialist forces.

Akira Kazami, head of the Japanese delegation, emphasized the great significance of the conference, saying, "The world conference shows that Japan's anti-nuclear weapons movement has embarked on the correct path of the peace movement. The guiding ideology of the conference is that U.S. imperialism is the greatest source of war threats."

Iku Yasui said that the future task of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is to make local councils into fighting organizations and transform them into groups of peace warriors.

Many representatives, in answering questions from Japanese reporters, unanimously emphasized that they gained greater courage from the fact that all foreign representatives enthusiastically supported the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

Haruyo Maeda, from Niijima—where the people are opposing the establishment of missile launch sites—said that she was greatly encouraged to hear that many people in Japan and abroad firmly support the Niijima people's struggle against the missile base. She said, "The Chinese representatives advised me and my colleagues to eliminate any sense of isolation, saying that the issue of establishing a missile base in Niijima is not only a Japanese issue but also an issue for the people of all countries. I was deeply moved by this."

She also said: "The Chinese representative told me that he would definitely convey the greetings of the people of Niijima to the entire Chinese people after returning home. I will also take this encouraging promise from the Chinese representative back to my island."

One young woman said: "I realized that there are so many people in Japan and around the world fighting to defend peace, and I am very excited about this."

Another young woman representative said: "Listening to the speech of the Chinese representative moved me to tears. I was so moved because I realized that the Chinese people are watching the Japanese people with the passionate understanding of true friends." She continued: "We have realized what it truly means to fight for peace. It is to increase the number of our comrades one by one, thereby isolating the enemy of peace, the U.S. imperialists."

Toshinobu Arai, a peace marcher who walked all the way from Niigata to Tokyo, emphasized that because he participated in the Sixth World Conference, he clearly realized that the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is an integral part of the world peace movement. He said: "After I go home, I will try to make as many people as possible understand this relationship between the Japanese people's peace movement and the peace movement conducted on an international scale."

Seiji Iwakura, a writer from Toyama Prefecture who led a delegation of thirty people from his prefecture to the conference, said that the strong spirit of international unity that permeated the conference deeply moved him and the representatives from Toyama Prefecture.

Iwakura emphasized, "The conference achieved great success. The Sixth World Conference clearly drew a line between the enemies and friends of peace.

Minoru Maede, Secretary-General of the Japan Democratic Youth League, said: "I am deeply impressed by the tremendous growth of people's power in the past year. We learned from the speeches of foreign representatives how the Japanese people's resolute struggle is related to U.S. imperialism. We are now deeply convinced that we will be able to carry out the struggle even more powerfully and successfully in the future."

Ayako Ishii, Chairperson of the Women's Democratic Club, said that she was particularly impressed by the speeches of representatives from Asian and African countries.

She also pointed out that she was also deeply impressed by the greater courage, determination, and clearer political line displayed by the Japanese representatives. She said, "The central idea of this conference will be understood by an increasingly wider range of people from all walks of life."

Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: North Korean and Vietnamese newspapers hail the achievements of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

Today's "Rodong Sinmun" in North Korea published a commentary pointing out that the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament was a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its followers, who are keen on exacerbating international tensions and the "Cold War," and once again demonstrated the unity of the people in the struggle for peace.

The commentary emphasized that the unity of peace-loving people around the world is an important guarantee for maintaining and strengthening peace. It is entirely correct that this conference particularly emphasized the unity of the people of the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa, in the struggle for independence, peace, and disarmament.

The commentary criticized the Ikeda government of Japan for refusing entry to the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea under the instigation of U.S. imperialism; the U.S. imperialist lackey, the Yugoslav Tito clique, sneaked into the conference and deliberately carried out provocative activities in order to disrupt the work of the conference.

The commentary said that the resolutions and documents adopted by the conference made an important contribution to further strengthening and developing the struggle to defend world peace. The Korean people will, from now on, unite with peace-loving people around the world to carry out a more resolute struggle against the aggressive policies of the U.S. imperialists and to defend lasting peace in the Far East and the world.

Today's "Nhan Dan" in Vietnam published a commentary saying that the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament achieved a victory of great significance, marking a new progress in the united struggle of the people of Asia and the world against nuclear weapons and for the defense of peace in Asia and the world. The commentary said that the Japanese working class and people, who once forced Eisenhower to abandon his visit to Japan, overthrew the war criminal Nobusuke Kishi, and are waging a persistent and heroic struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, made important contributions to the success of this conference.

The commentary said that the resolutions and messages adopted by this conference are indictments of the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism. Through these important documents and their speeches at the meeting, the representatives of various countries thoroughly exposed the extremely reactionary and stubborn face of U.S. imperialism, sternly accused the world of the extremely dangerous conspiracies adopted by U.S. imperialism against the people, and pointed out the specific goals of the struggle for world peace and national independence for the people of all countries.

The commentary stated that the Vietnamese people warmly welcome the resolutions of this conference and firmly stand with the people of Asia and the world to actively contribute to the struggle against the war conspiracy of U.S. imperialism, against nuclear weapons, and for the defense of peace and security in Asia and the world.

    日本各界代表谈禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会成就
    各国人民加强团结反对帝国主义
    朝越报纸指出这次大会给予美帝国主义和它的追随者沉重打击
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：出席第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会的许多日本代表在向日本记者谈他们对这次大会的印象时一致指出，这次世界大会最重要的成就是加强了各国人民之间为反对帝国主义势力而共同斗争的国际团结。
    日本代表团团长风见章强调这次大会的重大意义，他说，“世界大会说明，日本反对核武器的运动已走上和平运动的正确道路。大会的主导思想是，美帝国主义是战争威胁最大的根源。”
    安井郁说，日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会今后的任务是使地方协议会成为战斗的组织，并改造它们成为和平战士的团体。
    许多代表在回答日本记者的问题时一致强调说，他们从所有的外国代表都热情支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争这个事实中获得了更大的勇气。
    来自新岛——那里的人民正在反对建立导弹发射基地——的前田春代说，她听说在日本和国外有许多人坚决支持新岛人民反对导弹基地的斗争时受到极大的鼓舞。她说，“中国代表劝告我和我的同事们消除孤立感，如果有孤立感的话，他们说，在新岛建立导弹基地的问题不仅是日本的问题，而且是世界各国人民的问题，我听了大为感动。”
    她并且说：“中国代表对我说，他回国后一定把新岛人民的问候转达给全体中国人民。我也将把中国代表这个令人鼓舞的诺言带到我的岛上去。”
    一位女青年说：“我知道了在日本和全世界有那么多人在为保卫和平而进行斗争，我为此感到非常兴奋”。
    另外一位女青年代表说：“倾听了中国代表的讲话，使我感动得流泪。我所以受感动，是因为我认识到中国人民以作为真正的朋友的热情的谅解注视着日本人民”。她接着说：“我们体会到，为和平而斗争真正意味着什么。这是为了使我们的同伴一个一个增多，从而使和平的敌人美帝国主义者陷于孤立”。
    从新澙一直走到东京的和平游行者荒井俊信强调说：因为参加了第六届世界大会，他就清楚地认识到，日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，是世界和平运动的不可分割的一部分。他说：“在我回家之后，我将设法使尽可能多的人了解日本人民的和平运动同在国际规模上进行的和平运动之间的这种关系”。
    率领本县三十人组成的代表团参加大会的、富山县的作家岩仓政治说：大会上洋溢着的强烈的国际团结精神，使他和富山县的代表们深深受到感动。
    岩仓着重指出，“大会获得了很大的成功。第六届世界大会明确地划清了和平的敌人和朋友之间的界限。
    日本民主青年同盟书记长前出稔说：“我对于人民力量在过去一年巨大的成长有很深的印象。我们从外国代表的讲话中获悉，日本人民的坚决斗争如何同美帝国主义有联系。我们现在深信，我们在今后能够把斗争进行得更加有力和成功”。
    妇女民主俱乐部委员长石井绫子说，亚非国家代表的讲话使她获得特别深刻的印象。
    她还指出，日本代表所显示的更大的勇气、决心和更加明确的政治路线，也给她得到了深刻印象。她说，“这次大会的中心思想将为越来越广泛的各阶层人民所理解。”
    据新华社11日讯　朝鲜和越南的报纸，欢呼第六届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的成就。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论指出，第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会，是对热衷于加剧国际紧张局势和“冷战”的美帝国主义和它的追随者的沉重打击，并且又一次显示了人民在争取和平的斗争中的团结。
    评论强调说，全世界爱好和平人民的团结，是维护和加强和平的重要保证。这次大会特别强调世界人民特别是亚非人民在争取独立、和平和裁军的斗争中的团结，这是完全正确的。
    评论指责日本池田政府在美帝国主义嗾使下，拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表入境；潜入大会的美帝国主义的奴才南斯拉夫铁托集团，为了破坏会议的工作，蓄意进行了挑衅活动。
    评论说，这次大会通过的决议和文件，对进一步加强和发展保卫世界和平的斗争作出了重要贡献。朝鲜人民今后要同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，为反对美帝国主义者的侵略政策，为保卫远东和世界的持久和平进行更加坚决的斗争。
    越南“人民报”今天发表评论说，第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会获得了具有重大意义的胜利，这标志着亚洲和世界人民反对核武器、保卫亚洲和世界和平的团结一致的斗争有了新的进展。评论说，日本工人阶级和人民曾经迫使艾森豪威尔不敢访问日本，打倒了战争罪犯岸信介，并且正在为反对日美军事同盟条约进行坚持不懈的英勇斗争，他们为这次大会的成功作出了重要的贡献。
    评论说，这次大会所通过的决议和文告都是对美帝国主义的滔天罪行的控诉书。出席这次会议的各国代表通过这些重要的文件和他们在会上的发言，彻底揭穿了美帝国主义的极其反动和顽固的面目，严正地向全世界控诉了美帝国主义对人民所采取的极其危险的阴谋，并为各国人民指出了争取世界和平、民族独立的斗争的具体目标。
    评论表示，越南人民热烈欢迎这次大会的决议，并坚决同亚洲和世界人民站在一起，为反对美帝国主义的战争阴谋，反对核武器，为保卫亚洲和世界和平和安全而积极作出贡献。
