    尼日尔共和国宣告独立
    新华社3日讯　尼亚美消息：在民族独立运动空前高涨的非洲的西部，今天又有一个新国家诞生——尼日尔共和国宣布独立。
    从2日晚上起，在尼日尔首都尼亚美以及尼日尔其他地方，欢乐的人群举行游行、晚会、舞会和体育比赛等活动，热烈庆祝他们长期斗争所取得的胜利。
    3日清晨，尼亚美举行了尼日尔共和国总理迪奥里正式宣布独立的仪式，并鸣放了礼炮。
    在宣布独立以前，法国国务部长雅基诺代表法国政府同尼日尔总理迪奥里在尼亚美交换了关于法国承认尼日尔独立的文件。据规定，尼日尔共和国独立后仍然留在调整后的“法兰西共同体”内。尼日尔立法议会已经在7月29日宣布改称为“国民议会”。
