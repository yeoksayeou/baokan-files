    Let's Put Down Roots Here!
    Wang Jianlin
    Feicheng in Shandong is famous for its fertile peaches. The People's Commune of Taoyuan (Peach Garden), named after its peach orchards, has the Shangli Brigade, which produces the most peaches. The peaches here are famous at home and abroad. They are plump and full, with thin skin, juicy flesh, and a sweet taste. When they are ripe, you can insert a tube into the peach and suck out everything, leaving only the skin and pit. But before liberation, the masses had a folk song that said: Barren hills and ridges grow no grass, Beloved peach trees are all cut down; In the morning, chaff and vegetables, at noon, watery soup, At night, thin porridge under the moonlight; Young men flee to other places, Girls from other villages won't come here. After liberation, the Party led the people to rebuild the peach orchards. By 1956, Shangli had more than 7,200 peach trees and had cultivated more than 60,000 new saplings, which urgently needed grafting. However, using the old method of "cleft grafting," one person could only graft about 30 trees a day, and there were few experienced peach farmers. Finally, the Party branch found a way to invite four girls who were studying at the Tai'an Fruit Tree Horticultural Farm. Among them was a girl named Wang Guiying, who was not very tall and only eighteen years old. After graduating from senior primary school, she entered the Tai'an Fruit Tree Horticultural Farm to study, and she often achieved good results because she put her heart into her studies. When they arrived in Shangli, the Party branch warmly welcomed them on behalf of the masses. Wang Guiying and the others felt that they had little skill, but the villagers had such great hope, so they shook the hand of the Party branch secretary, Li Hengming, and said with emotion, "We will do our best to pass on our skills to our sisters."
    One day, the Party branch secretary of the township, Li Hengming, and the director of the agricultural cooperative, Li Zhiwen, treated Guiying and the others with freshly picked peaches. Suddenly, Guiying asked Secretary Li:
    "These peaches are so delicious, wouldn't it be good to plant more?"
    Li Hengming had been paying attention to this girl for a long time—she was honest and capable. He thought to himself, it would be great if the cooperative had such a technical talent. So he seized the opportunity to say:
      "We are planning to develop on a large scale now, but the technical strength can't keep up. In the early years, inviting people to graft peach trees required three dishes and four bowls [as payment]. Now we don't need that, but there are too few experienced people, and no new people have been trained."
    In 1957, Shangli cultivated more than 60 mu of new peach seedlings. In July, the good season for grafting peaches arrived again. Township head Li Henglu ran to the Tai'an Fruit Tree Horticultural Farm twice, specifically to bring Wang Guiying over. As soon as Guiying entered Shangli, she arrived just in time for a meeting of commune members. The township Party branch secretary, Li Hengming, was talking about the changes in Shangli before and after. When he talked about the miserable life of an "old bachelor" in Shangli who only wore a ragged cotton-padded coat all his life, he himself cried, many commune members cried, and Guiying's tears also rolled down: the scene of losing her father in childhood and her mother dragging her four sisters around begging for food reappeared before her eyes. She thought: "My past experience is the same as that of the people of Shangli. They need my help so much, what am I reluctant to give up!" Her heart began to beat with the hearts of the masses. The vow "to make fertile peaches everywhere and to turn poor mountains into rich mountains" encouraged the people present and also inspired Guiying. She said to herself in her heart: "Let's put down roots here!"
    At this meeting, a fruit tree horticultural team of 56 people was established. After three days of training, Guiying led them to graft more than 100,000 peach trees in 20 days. During this period, the Party branch often cared for her and asked her about her well-being, and the commune members treated her like a sister. In her own labor, she felt even more the loveliness of this mountain area. Beautiful and moving images were constantly painted in her heart. Finally, she told the Party branch her inner thoughts about not leaving. The township Party branch secretary, Li Hengming, was overjoyed and said that he would immediately consult with the Tai'an Horticultural Farm to obtain their consent.
    Guiying did not regard herself as a special person with technical skills. She melted her whole heart into the masses. In the winter of the year she arrived, she joined the people of Shangli in the battle to control the mountains. When working on the mountain, the hoe struck against the stone, and the hoe and her eyes sparked. After working for a few days, Guiying felt that her legs were sore, her waist ached, and her arms were swollen. Old blisters had not turned into calluses, and new blood blisters were worn out. The sisters loved her and helped her sit on a stone, and the Party branch secretary also came over and told her not to work. Guiying sat aside and looked carefully: others were lightly prying based on the characteristics of the stone, but she only knew how to use brute force, which damaged her hands and still couldn't pry the stone out. How could this work? There was also knowledge in mountain management. She went to learn from Grandpa Li Hengke. Grandpa Li said: "I am not as good as you at grafting peaches, but you are not as good as me at mountain management." He patiently taught her. Finally, Guiying's strength became smooth, and she also grasped the essentials of mountain management, and quickly learned to repair terraced fields, dig fish-scale pits, and build weirs and dams and other mountain tasks.
    Because she had a red heart for building the mountain area, in recent years, whether it was the severe winter with the bitter north wind or the scorching summer with the blazing sun, she went up the mountain under the stars every day and returned home by moonlight. No matter what kind of dirty and tiring work, agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry, she did everything. The commune members praised her as an "uncomplaining hen." In the drought-resistant summer planting, she transported water from Shangli to Yanjia Cliff, traveling twelve li back and forth across the mountains, and she made several trips back and forth all night, and was rated as the number one iron girl in the team, and was elected as the captain of the Iron Girls Team.
    In November 1958, Guiying was gloriously admitted to the Communist Party, and then attended the Second National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists. Since then, an idea has been swirling in her mind: other work can have a great leap forward, can the cultivation of fertile peaches also have a great leap forward? Because of this, she couldn't close her eyes half the night. She asked Li Fangming, an old peach farmer with 24 years of cultivation experience, for advice, consulted reference books, studied with team members, and analyzed her usual observations of peach nature. Finally, she realized a way to make fertile peaches bear fruit earlier. In this way, the fruiting period of fertile peaches was advanced from five years to three years. Old peach farmers exclaimed: "Thinking makes a leap forward, and trees also make a leap forward. Guiying has only been in the peach orchard for three years, and she has made fertile peaches bear fruit two years earlier. This skill is really unmatched!"
      The ideal of "peach blossoms blooming everywhere, peach orchards everywhere" is about to be realized. Last winter, when Guiying was attending a meeting in Jinan, she heard that the Party General Branch had decided to establish a 20,000-mu large peach orchard, and she jumped up with joy. On the way back to the county, four li from home, she joined the tree planting ranks. The next day, she led 20 girls, in the pitch-black night, twice to transport seedlings from Black Cow Mountain, which was sixteen li away, and planted all the more than 6,000 seedlings that were transported. Within seven days, she and her team members planted more than 80,000 peach trees according to the specifications of "horizontal rows and vertical lines." In order to ensure that the peach trees safely overwinter, she led 13 sisters and brushed the trunks of the fertile peach trees with lime water.
    She has deeply fallen in love with Taoyuan. She often says happily to herself: "Looking at the boundless Taoyuan, I don't know why, I am full of energy!"

    就把根扎在这里吧！	王建林
    山东有个盛产肥桃的肥城，肥城有个以桃园命名的人民公社，桃园公社有个产桃最多的尚里大队。此地肥桃，中外驰名。它肥硕丰满，皮薄汁多味甜。当成熟时，用一根管子插到桃内一吸，就只剩下了皮包桃核。可是在解放前，群众有首歌谣说：荒山秃岭草不长，心爱桃树被砍光；早晨糠菜晌午汤，晚上稀粥照月亮；小伙逃荒往外跑，外乡姑娘不进庄。解放后，党领导人民重建桃园，1956年，尚里已有七千二百多棵桃树，并且新育六万多棵桃苗，急待嫁接。可是用“切接”的老办法，一天一人只能嫁接三十多棵，老桃农也没有几个。最后党支部设法到太安果树园艺场请来了四个在那里学习的姑娘。这当中有个身材不高、年方十八岁的女孩子，名叫王桂英。她高小毕业后，入太安果树园艺场学习，由于学习上心，经常取得好成绩。她们来到尚里后，党支部代表群众热烈欢迎。王桂英等人觉得本事很少，而乡亲们希望这样大，只感动地握着乡党支书李恒明的手说：“我们一定尽心把技术传授给姊妹们。”
    有一天，乡党支书李恒明、农业合作社社长李志文用刚摘下的鲜桃招待桂英等人。忽地，桂英问李支书：
    “肥桃这样中吃，多栽些不行吗？”
    李恒明早就留心这个姑娘——她为人实在、能干，曾想，社内有这样个技术人材多好，于是乘势说：
      “现在正计划大发展，可就是技术力量跟不上。早年请人接桃树，要三个碟子四个碗。现今不用这样了，可老手太少，新手又没培养起来。”
    1957年，尚里新育桃苗六十多亩。7月，又到了接桃的好季节。乡长李恒路跑了两趟太安果树园艺场，专把王桂英接来。桂英一进尚里，正赶上开社员大会，乡党支书李恒明在讲尚里前后的变化。当他讲到尚里过去有个“老光棍”，一辈子只穿了一件破棉袄那种凄惨生活时，他自己哭了，很多社员哭了，桂英也泪珠滚滚：幼年丧父，母亲拖着姊妹四人到处要饭的情景，又再现在她眼前。她想：“自己过去的遭遇和尚里人民一样，他们这样需要我来帮助，我有什么舍不得的呢！”她的心开始和群众的心一起跳动，“要让肥桃遍地是，要使穷山变富山”的誓愿，鼓舞着到会的人，也振奋着桂英。她暗暗对自己说：“就把根扎在这里吧！”
    在这个会上，成立了一个五十六人的果树园艺队。训练三天后，桂英带他们在二十天内接完了十几万棵桃树。这时期党支部经常对她问寒问暖，社员拿她当亲姊妹待。在亲身劳动中，她更感到这个山区的可爱，一幅幅美丽动人的图景，时刻在她心中描画。最后，她终于向党支部说出了不再离开的心里话。乡党支书李恒明喜不自胜，表示立即就跟太安园艺场协商，取得他们同意。
    桂英并不把自己看做是有技术的特殊人物，她把全身心都融化在群众中了。刚来那年冬天，就和尚里人民一起参加治山战斗。在山上干活，镢头碰在石头上，镢头、眼睛冒火星，干了几天，桂英觉得腿疼腰酸胳膊肿，手上老泡未长茧，新的血泡又磨起来。姊妹们疼爱她，拥她到石头上坐着，党支书也走来不让她干。桂英坐在一旁端详：别人都是根据石头特点轻轻用力刨，而她却只会用猛劲，震坏了手，石头还刨不出来。这哪能行？治山也有学问。她跑去拜李恒科大爷为师。李大爷说：“接桃我不如你，治山你不如我。”便耐心地教她。终于，桂英劲顺过来了，治山要领也摸到了，很快学会整修梯田，挖鱼鳞坑，修堰挡坝等山区活路。
    由于她有着一颗建设山区的红心，几年来不管是北风凛冽的严冬，还是烈日炎炎的酷暑，每天她都是披星上山，戴月回家。不管脏活累活、农牧林业，什么都干。社员赞佩地称她是“不鸣的鸡”。在抗旱夏种中，从尚里往阎家崖送水，翻山越岭往返十二里，她一夜来回好几趟，被评为全队第一名铁姑娘，并当选钢铁姑娘队队长。
    1958年11月，桂英光荣地被吸收为共产党员，接着又出席了全国第二次青年建设社会主义积极分子代表大会。此后，一种想法老在她心中打旋：别的工作都能大跃进，栽培肥桃能否也来个大跃进？为这，她曾半夜半宿地不能合眼。她向有二十四年栽培经验的老桃农李方明请教，翻阅参考书，跟队员研究，加上平常对桃性的观察分析，终于悟出了一条使肥桃提前结果的办法。这样一来，肥桃结果期便由五年提前为三年。老桃农感叹地说：“思想跃进，树也跃进。桂英来桃园才三年，就使肥桃提前两年结果。这一手真比不了！”
      “遍地桃花开，处处是桃园”的理想就要实现了。去冬桂英正在济南开会时，听说党总支决定建立两万亩大桃园的消息，高兴得跳了起来。在回县离家四里的路上，她就参加了植树行列。第二天，她又率领二十个姑娘，在漆黑的夜里，两次到十六里地外的黑牛山运树苗，并且将运到的六千多棵树苗全部栽上。七天内，她同队员按“横看成趟，竖看成行”的规格，栽植桃树八万多棵。为了保证桃树安全过冬，她又带领十三个姊妹，用石灰水刷了肥桃树干。
    她已经深深地爱上了桃园。她自己常美滋滋地说：“一看桃园无边，不知怎的，我浑身都是劲了！”
