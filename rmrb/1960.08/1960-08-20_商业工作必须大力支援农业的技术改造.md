    Commercial Work Must Vigorously Support the Technical Transformation of Agriculture
    He Shoulun
    The development of China's national economy is based on agriculture. Placing agriculture in the primary position and all industries vigorously supporting the technical transformation of agriculture to accelerate its development has set forth a new task for commercial work. Commerce must closely revolve around the Party's current production center, making every effort to supply the means of production needed by agriculture, arming agriculture with modern technology, accelerating agricultural technical transformation, and promoting the high-speed development of agriculture, taking this as the top priority task of the commercial sector.
    On the basis of the consolidation and development of the People's Communes, carrying out comprehensive technical transformation of agriculture is a great change in agricultural production. This transformation is agricultural mechanization, electrification, and water conservancy. The process of agricultural mechanization, electrification, and water conservancy puts forward multifaceted demands for the means of production. Not only do field farming operations require machinery, but non-field operations also require machinery. In terms of water conservancy, tools for building dikes, dams, and digging canals are needed, as well as large-scale power equipment for water diversion and drainage. In terms of electrification, there is electricity for production and electricity for daily life, requiring power generation. In short, from various agricultural production activities to commune industries, the quantity required is large, the types are numerous, the seasonality is strong, and they are becoming more and more comprehensive.
    The various varieties of agricultural means of production are mostly used in conjunction, and failure in one will prevent the others from functioning. With tractors, there must be fuel and machine-drawn farm implements. With machinery, there must be parts; with power generation equipment, there must be conductive materials and power-consuming devices; with cutting tools, there must be measuring tools, and so on. At the same time, there are intricate and complex associated relationships between the various varieties.
    The specifications of agricultural means of production are complex and difficult to grasp. Some materials are restricted by climate, geography, and other conditions in their use; some materials have little versatility and are used for specific purposes. A slight difference in the specifications and quality of individual parts will affect the performance of the entire machine. The commercial sector responsible for the supply of materials not only completes the task by supplying them, but also helps with installation, repair, and even guarantees their use.
    The supply of agricultural means of production must be timely and accurate. Even if some small mechanical parts cannot be guaranteed to be supplied on time, or if the fuel is delayed for a moment, the machine will stop, delaying the farming season; a slight delay in the supply of pesticides will cause pests to spread, affecting crop yields. Not only should the supply be timely, but it should also precede the farming season to meet the urgent needs of production. In the agricultural technical transformation movement, when a new technical equipment appears, it will immediately receive widespread attention. Therefore, the demand for commodities also forms the characteristics of large quantities, batches, and concentration. Summarizing the above changes, they can be summarized as "more (more quantity), complete (complete variety), high (high efficiency), precise (precise), large (large-scale), and early (early time)."
    This change in the needs of agricultural production reflects that commercial material supply work has entered a new stage. Without seeing these new laws of change, not knowing the varieties, not understanding the performance, not knowing how to install, and not knowing how to use them among thousands of kinds of material supplies, it is impossible to do a good job in the supply work of the commercial sector. This requires the commercial sector to continuously conduct investigation and research in many aspects, and grasp these laws of change, making every effort to achieve "logistics go first," serving agricultural production ahead of the farming season. To grasp these complex laws of change, the unfamiliar must be turned into the familiar, and what you do not know must be learned. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: "If we want to directly understand a certain thing or things, we can only participate in the practical struggle to change reality and change a certain thing or things... in order to expose the essence of that or those things and understand them." To achieve this, we must go deep into the process of agricultural technical transformation, go deep into the masses, learn production knowledge, study technology, and be familiar with commodities together with the production sector, know the performance, and be able to use and repair, learn both supply business and production knowledge, in order to adapt to the new needs of agricultural production development.
    Accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization, on the one hand, puts forward a large number of new material needs for the commercial sector, and on the other hand, because the rural People's Communes have embarked on the road of consolidation and sound development, it has added infinite vitality to the basic construction of agriculture. With the development of commune-run industries, the communes have the power to arm themselves, which provides a new material basis for commercial support for agricultural technical transformation. Agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization ultimately require the use of machine operations in places where labor is most costly to improve labor productivity. Threshing, rice milling, chopping grass, feed crushing, and processing of local and sideline products have always been labor-intensive and labor-consuming areas; the development of animal husbandry requires manpower to raise pigs and chickens; public canteens, sewing, shoemaking, and other living welfare undertakings also require a lot of manpower. These non-field labor is also an important aspect of agricultural technical transformation. These tools are currently not standardized and complete in large-scale industrial production, nor are they manufactured in large quantities. All mechanical tools of this kind are most suitable for on-the-spot reform, on-the-spot manufacturing, and on-the-spot use. Therefore, the commercial sector must supply machinery to arm the agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing industry of the commune. After the agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing industry of the commune is developed, simple machinery and some agricultural implement sets as well as minor repairs of power equipment can be solved within the commune, and even major tractor repairs can be done without leaving the commune. With the ability to arm itself, the agricultural machinery factories above the county level will greatly reduce the burden of repairing and manufacturing simple machinery, and can free up a hand to produce products that commune industries cannot produce. Vigorously supporting commune industry is a fundamental way to promote the realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization in all production links of agriculture. The commercial sector must vigorously support the rapid development of the commune's agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing industry from participating in planning, supplying equipment, exchanging technology, purchasing products, and solving raw materials.
    Emphasizing the self-reliance of commune industry does not mean reducing the task of the commercial sector in guaranteeing the supply of various materials for agricultural technical transformation. From the actual situation of commercial work in Heilongjiang Province, due to the large-scale and comprehensive agricultural technical transformation, the "high, large, and precise" agricultural machinery needed is increasing, so the commercial sector must correspondingly strengthen the supply of production materials, and the commercial production materials supply network must be complete, and the distribution of goods must be more and more reasonable. Taking the experience of accessory supply of agricultural machinery in Baiquan County as an example, they have gradually made various accessories with complex specifications, scattered, and large quantities "complete in the county, available in the commune, convenient to use, available wherever used, and available whenever used," ensuring the replenishment of production machinery accessories and the needs of factory repair and assembly by adopting the methods of "improving the network, combining stores and factories, investigating needs, timely procurement, reasonable layout, and overall mobilization." Practice has proved that commercial work should be done more and more meticulously.
    After communization, production is large-scale collective labor, and the timeliness of agricultural production is very strong. Therefore, the material supply method of the commercial sector needs to be improved even more; if the supply method of sales and door-to-door delivery in the past is still adopted, it is no longer adapted to the current development of agriculture. In order to cherish labor time and adapt to the needs of agricultural production development, materials must be supplied to the front line of production. Fighting with the water conservancy army, supplying water conservancy construction machinery to the construction site; random farming operations, supplying fuel to the field; ensuring that the machine does not stop, supplying accessories to the factory. Not only that, in order to adapt to the increasingly complex technical nature of operating commodities, it is also necessary to do mechanical and technical work in the countryside, and be fully responsible for supply, repair, and use, thereby raising commercial work to a new level in the face of the new situation.
    Large-scale and comprehensive agricultural technical transformation requires a considerable amount of investment, which is undoubtedly true. Practice has proved that the main way to obtain funds is to rely on the masses, develop production, and raise funds on their own. Since the Great Leap Forward, Heilongjiang Province has conscientiously implemented the principle of taking grain as the key link, vigorously developing diversified production, and raising funds for agricultural mechanization, which has formed a mass production and procurement movement. The broad masses of people work hard and practically, engage in diversified operations, seek oil and wine from various seed starch raw materials, seek papermaking raw materials from wild fibers, seek wool, fur, and meat from animals, seek medicinal materials from mountains and fields, seek aquatic products from rivers, and achieve comprehensive utilization of various agricultural and sideline products. The fifty major diversified production projects focusing on the four major non-staple foods of pigs, poultry, vegetables, and fish, and the seven major raw materials of reeds, rosin, soda ash, fur, pyrite, silkworm cocoons, and weaving, have undergone comprehensive and great development. The commercial sector and the agricultural sector have closely cooperated, jointly planning production, jointly arranging labor, and jointly solving problems in production, so the indicators for raising funds for agricultural mechanization have been overfulfilled again and again. Starting from the Great Leap Forward in 1958, after the experience of the Weihe People's Commune in Shangzhi County in developing procurement business and promoting production development from the starting point of production and nurturing sources of goods was promoted throughout the province, the province's procurement volume in 1958 increased by two times compared with 1957, raising funds for agriculture by 500 million yuan. In 1959, the province further promoted the Baiquan County's agricultural product procurement system of "quantitative disclosure, negotiated purchase, arrangement of consumption, and over-quota reward," thereby promoting the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery, especially animal husbandry with pigs as the head. Baiquan County is a key county in Heilongjiang Province that has achieved agricultural mechanization one step ahead. In 1959, the commercial sector of the county raised funds for agriculture by 18 million yuan through the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. The province's procurement of various agricultural and sideline products has also leaped again and again, raising funds for agriculture by 700 million yuan in 1959. Since the first half of this year, the whole province has also seen Longjiang County's commercial sector procure at high speed, high standards, and overfulfill the task of every variety of tasks. Due to the universal implementation of these experiences, Heilongjiang Province can raise another 1 billion yuan for agricultural mechanization this year on the basis of last year's 700 million yuan through vigorously developing diversified production. In this way, the annual average calculation can reach 1.5 million yuan for each commune and 100 yuan for each farmer. What a strong financial strength this is. Therefore, the commercial sector starts from implementing the principle of taking grain as the key link and developing diversified production, expanding the procurement of agricultural, sideline, and local special products, and raising funds for agricultural technical transformation, which is a correct road of self-reliance, more, faster, better, and more economical.
    The commercial sector promotes the comprehensive development of grain as the key link and diversified operations, which is an important link in supporting agricultural technical transformation. The commercial sector has the characteristics of being well-informed and having a wide range of contacts; at the same time, it also has a complete commercial network and strong economic strength. Therefore, it must give full play to its role as a link between production, expand sales channels for diversified production, supply tools for production, provide equipment for processing and comprehensive utilization, and provide conditions for the development of agricultural and sideline products and short-distance transportation. At present, the commercial sector in Heilongjiang Province, based on everything starting from the development of production, is making every effort to promote the formation of a strong diversified commodity production supply base network and a wide range of comprehensive utilization and processing networks of agricultural and sideline products throughout the province, raising more and better funds for agricultural technical transformation.
    Realizing the comprehensive technical transformation of agriculture is a national political task, which requires vigorous support from various departments, and the commercial sector bears a major responsibility. Commerce is the circulation and distribution link of the national economy. All commercial activities must revolve around the center of industrial and agricultural production, rely on production, and be based on production. Without production, commerce has nothing to do. Commercial support for agricultural technical transformation must also closely cooperate with industrial, transportation, and other departments, and must also support the development of industry and transportation. The commercial sector can support all walks of life well, and can increase the material strength to support agriculture from all aspects. Therefore, the commercial sector must take the initiative to cooperate with all parties, give full play to the role of commerce in linking all parties, and revolve around the production center, with industry, agriculture, and commerce twisted into one rope, and work together to support agricultural technical transformation, in order to have great strength, fast time, and significant results.

    商业工作必须大力支援农业的技术改造
    何首伦
    我国国民经济的发展，是以农业为基础的。把农业放在首要地位，各行各业大力支援农业技术改造，加快农业的发展速度，这就为商业工作提出了新的任务。商业必须紧紧围绕着党的当前生产中心，千方百计地供应农业需要的生产资料，以现代技术武装农业，加速农业技术改造，促进农业高速度发展，以此作为商业部门头等重要的任务。
    在人民公社巩固和发展的基础上，对农业全面进行技术改造，这是农业生产上一次伟大的变革。这个变革，就是农业机械化、电气化、水利化。农业机械化、电气化、水利化的过程，对生产资料的需要，提出了多方面的要求。不仅农业生产田间耕作需要机械，非田间作业也需要机械。在水利方面，需要修堤筑坝、开渠破土工具，还需要引水排涝的大型动力设备；电气化方面有生产用电，又有生活用电，需要发电动力。总之，从农业各项生产到公社工业，需要的数量大、种类多、季节性强，而且都是越来越全面。
    农业生产资料的各个品种之间，多是配套使用，缺一就不能发挥作用。有了拖拉机，就要有燃料和机引农具。有机械就要有零件；有发电设备就要有导电资材、耗电装置；有切削工具，就要有量具，等等。同时，各个品种之间又有错综复杂的联带关系。
    农业生产资料的规格复杂，不易掌握。有些物资在使用上受气候、地理等条件的限制；有些物资通用性少，是专物专用的物资。个别部件规格质量稍差，就会影响整个机器效能的发挥。担负物资供应的商业部门，不仅供应了就算完成任务，而且还要帮助安装、修理以至保证使用。
    农业生产资料的供应，要及时、准确。哪怕是一些很小的机械零件，如果不能保证按时供应，或者由于燃料耽误片刻，都会使机器停驶，贻误农时；农药的供应稍有迟误，就会使虫害蔓延，影响农作物的收成。不仅供应要及时，而且应当走在农时的前面，以应生产之急需。在农业技术改造运动中，当某种新的技术设备一出现，就会立即受到普遍重视。因此，对商品的要求也形成了量大、成批、集中的特点。上述这些变化，归纳起来可以用“多（数量多）、全（品种全）、高（工效高）、精（精密）、大（大型）、早（时间早）”来概括。
    农业生产需要的这种变化，它反映出商业物资供应工作进入了一个新阶段。看不到这些新的变化规律，在千万种物资供应中，不知品种，不懂性能，不会安装，不会使用，就不可能做好商业部门的供应工作。这就要求商业部门不断地从多方面调查研究，并掌握这些变化的规律，千方百计地做到“兵马未动，粮草先行”，赶在农时的前面，为农业生产服务。要掌握这些复杂的变化规律，就要把不熟悉的变为熟悉的，不会的要学会。毛泽东同志指示我们：“如果要直接地认识某种或某些事物，便只有亲身参加于变革现实、变革某种或某些事物的实践的斗争中，……才能暴露那种或那些事物的本质而理解它们。”要作到这一点，只有深入到农业技术改造的过程中去，深入到群众中去，同生产部门一起学习生产知识，钻研技术，熟悉商品，知道性能，并作到既会使用，又懂修理，学会供应业务和生产知识两套本领，才能适应农业生产发展的新的需要。
    加速实现农业机械化，一方面给商业部门提出了大量的新的物资需要，另一方面由于农村人民公社已经走上巩固和健全发展的道路，给农业的基本建设增加了无限的生命力。随着社办工业的发展，公社有了自己武装自己的力量，这又为商业支援农业技术改造提供了新的物质基础。农业机械化、半机械化归根结底是要在最费人工的地方使用机器操作，提高劳动生产率。脱谷、碾米、铡草、饲料粉碎以及土副产品加工等，历来都是费工多、占用劳动力多的地方；畜牧业的发展，需要占用人力养猪、喂鸡；公共食堂、缝纫、做鞋等生活福利事业，也需要许多人力。这些非田间劳动，也是农业技术改造的一个重要方面。这些工具，当前在大工业生产中没有定型成套，也没有大批制造，凡属于这类机械工具，最宜于就地改革，就地制造，就地使用。因此，商业部门要供应机械武装公社的农业机具修造工业。公社农业机具修造工业发展起来后，简易机械和部分农具配套以及动力设备的小修理，在公社内就能解决，甚至拖拉机大修也可以不出社。公社有了自己武装自己的能力，县以上的农业机械厂就大大减轻了修造简单机具的负担，可以腾出一只手来生产公社工业不能生产的产品。大力支援公社工业，这是推动农业的各个生产环节实现机械化、半机械化的一个根本途径。商业部门必须从参与规划，供应设备，交流技术，收购产品和解决原料等方面大力支援公社农业机具修造工业的迅速发展。
    强调公社工业自力更生，这并不意味着就减轻了商业部门对保证农业技术改造的各种物资供应的任务。从黑龙江省商业工作实际情况看来，由于大规模、全面地进行农业技术改造，需要的“高、大、精”的农业机械越来越多，所以商业部门就要相应地加强生产资料的供应工作，商业的生产资料供应网也要完整，商品分配也要越来越合理。以拜泉县农业机械的配件供应经验为例，他们由于采取了“健全网点，店厂结合，调查需要，及时进货，合理摆布，统筹调动”的办法，才把各种规格复杂、零星、量大的配件供应，逐步作到“县全、社有、用方便，哪里用哪里有，什么时候用什么时候有”，保证了生产机械配件的补充和工厂修配的需要。实践证明，商业工作应当愈做愈细致。
    公社化后，生产是大规模的集体劳动，农业生产的时间性很强。因此，商业部门的物资供应方式也越发需要改善；如果仍然采取过去那样销售、送货到门的供应方法，已经与当前农业的发展不相适应了。为了珍惜劳动时间和适应农业生产发展的需要，必须把物资供应到生产第一线。随水利大军作战，把水利施工机械供应到工地；随机耕作业，把油料供应到田间；保证机器不停车，把配件供应到厂。不仅如此，为了适应经营商品的技术性日益繁杂的情况，还要作到机械和技术双下乡，供、修、用全面负责到底，从而在新形势的面前把商业工作提高到一个新的水平。
    大规模全面地进行农业技术改造，需要相当数量的投资，这是无疑的。实践证明，资金来源的主要出路，是依靠群众，发展生产，自筹资金。大跃进以来，黑龙江省认真贯彻以粮为纲，大力发展多种经营生产，为农业机械化筹集资金，已经形成了群众性的生产和采购运动。广大群众苦干实干，大搞多种经营，向各种籽实淀粉原料要油要酒，向野生纤维要造纸原料，向动物要毛要皮要肉，向山野要药材，向江河要水产品，以及作到多种农副产品综合利用。以猪、禽、菜、鱼四大副食和芦苇、松香、土碱、皮毛、硫化铁、蚕茧、编织等七大原料为重点的五十大项多种经营生产，有了全面的大发展。商业部门和农业部门作到密切协作，共同规划生产，共同安排劳动力，共同解决生产中的问题，因此，为农业机械化筹集资金的指标一再超额完成。从大跃进的1958年开始，尚志县苇河人民公社从生产出发，从培育货源入手，开展采购业务，促进生产发展的经验在全省推广以后，1958年全省采购额比1957年增加了两倍，为农业筹集资金达五亿元。1959年全省又进一步推广了拜泉县的“定量交底，协商派购，安排消费，超额奖励”的农产品采购制度，从而促进了农林牧副渔特别是以猪为首的畜牧生产的发展。拜泉县是黑龙江省先一步实现农业机械化的重点县，1959年全县的商业部门通过农副产品采购，为农业筹集资金达一千八百万元。全省各种农副产品采购也一跃再跃，1959年为农业筹集资金达七亿元。今年上半年以来，全省又出现了龙江县商业部门采购高速度、高标准、项项品种超额完成任务的满堂红县。由于这些经验的普遍推行，黑龙江省全年可以在去年七亿元的基础上，通过大力发展多种经营生产，再为农业机械化筹集资金十亿元。这样，全年平均计算每一个公社可以达到一百五十万元，每一个农民可以达到一百元。这是一笔多么雄厚的资金力量。所以，商业部门从贯彻以粮为纲，发展多种经营生产入手，扩大农副土特产品的采购，为农业技术改造筹集资金，是一条自力更生，多、快、好、省的正确道路。
    商业部门促进以粮为纲，多种经营全面发展，是支援农业技术改造的重要一环。商业部门具有消息灵通，联系面广的特点；同时它也有一套完整的商业网和强大的经济力量。因此，必须充分发挥它联系生产的纽带作用，为多种经营生产扩大销路，为生产供应工具，为加工综合利用提供设备，为发展农副产品和短途运输提供条件。目前，黑龙江省商业部门本着一切从发展生产出发，千方百计地促进在全省范围内形成一个强大的多种经营商品生产供应基地网，和广泛的农副产品综合利用加工网，更多更好地为农业技术改造筹集资金。
    实现农业全面技术改造，是一个全民性的政治任务，要靠各个部门大力支援，商业部门更负有重大的责任。商业是国民经济的流通和分配环节，商业的一切活动都必须围绕着工农业生产中心，依靠生产，以生产为基础，离开了生产商业就无所作为。商业支援农业技术改造又必须和工业、交通等部门密切协作，又要很好地支援工业和交通运输的发展。商业支援好各行各业，就可以从各方面增加支援农业的物质力量。因此，商业部门必须主动和各方面协作，充分发挥商业联结各方的作用，围绕生产中心，工、农、商拧成一股绳，同心协力支援农业技术改造，才能力量大、时间快、效果显著。
