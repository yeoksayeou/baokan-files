Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 22nd. The Lao Fighting Forces Radio broadcast a commentary on the evening of August 19th, condemning American imperialism for manipulating Laos through "aid," establishing military bases in Laos, creating civil war in Laos, and bringing increasing suffering to the Lao people.

The commentary expressed support for Prince Souvanna Phouma's guarantee to follow a path of genuine peace and neutrality, accepting unconditional aid from all countries to develop the national economy and consolidate Laos' independence and sovereignty. The commentary pointed out that the primary condition for building and developing a country's national economy is the strength of its own people, so as to avoid dependence on foreign countries.

The commentary stated that Laos, like all economically underdeveloped countries, believes that foreign aid is very necessary and hopes to receive it. However, what our people need is selfless, sincere aid without any political conditions attached, so that our sovereignty and national independence are not harmed, and our independent economy can be rapidly developed.

The commentary pointed out that the United States has long provided Laos with a large amount of "aid." According to public figures, the United States has provided Laos with 250 million US dollars in aid since 1955. Calculated by average population, Laos is the country in the world that has received the most American "aid." However, among the aforementioned 250 million US dollars in "aid," 170 million US dollars is military aid, and the rest is luxury goods and surplus materials. These goods are dumped into Laos in large quantities, stifling Laos' domestic production. The commentary said, what have others gained from this "aid" besides some leftovers for a small group of Lao traitorous reactionaries? On the contrary, American imperialism has used this to manipulate Laos, establish military bases in Laos, and create civil war, "sweeps," death, and increasing suffering.

The commentary said that recently, after the coup committee overthrew the Phoumi Nosavan- Chao Somsanith reactionary group, the American ruling group threatened to reconsider its "aid" policy towards Laos. This is not surprising, because everyone knows that the usual tactic of the United States is to exert pressure on a country by reconsidering "aid" to that country when any changes unfavorable to the United States occur in the "recipient" country.

The commentary pointed out that although the United States is very cunning, it has not seen that the current international situation has changed greatly. It has forgotten that in addition to American "aid" with aggressive and exploitative characteristics, there is also the selfless and sincere aid of socialist countries. The latter has helped many economically underdeveloped countries develop independent economies in order to consolidate these countries' political independence. The commentary cited the facts that countries such as Cambodia and Cuba did not succumb to the pressure of "American aid" but accepted the selfless aid of socialist countries, overcame difficulties, developed their national economies, and thus improved their international status. It said that these facts show that without American "aid," we will never be put to death. On the contrary, any small and weak country, as long as it goes all out to build its own country, implements a genuine policy of peace and neutrality, and accepts unconditional aid from all countries, will surely receive the selfless aid of many friends, be able to maintain independence, and improve its international status.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 21st. According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency citing the "Voice of Laos Radio," many officers and soldiers of the Lao Royal Armed Forces still under the command of Phoumi Nosavan have expressed extreme indignation at the orders of the reactionary group. The radio reported that many soldiers of the Lao Royal Armed Forces stationed in the Salakham area of Vientiane Province surrendered to the people. They told the people, "If the reactionary commanders order their soldiers to shoot at the Lao brothers or the Vientiane brothers, many people will mutiny on the spot and shoot at these commanders." The radio said that in Sangthong, the officers and soldiers of the Lao Royal Armed Forces strongly opposed the orders of the reactionary Lieutenant Bounthan, and as a result, Bounthan had to flee.

    寮国战斗部队电台揭露美“援”的侵略实质
    要求老挝实现真正和平中立
    王国部队许多官兵反对亲美集团命令
    新华社河内22日电　寮国战斗部队电台8月19日晚发表评论，谴责美帝国主义利用“援助”操纵老挝，在老挝建立军事基地，在老挝制造内战和给老挝人民带来了与日俱增的痛苦。
    评论表示拥护富马亲王作出的保证，即遵循真正的和平中立道路，接受所有国家不带任何条件的援助，以发展国民经济，巩固老挝独立和主权。评论指出，对建设和发展一个国家的国民经济来说，首要条件是本国人民的力量，这样才能免于依附外国。
    评论说，我们老挝和所有经济不发达的国家一样，都认为外国的援助是很需要的，而且很希望得到援助。但是我国人民所需要的是无私的、真心诚意的、不附带任何政治条件的援助，以使我国的主权和民族独立不受到损害，并使我国的自主经济得到迅速发展。
    评论指出，美国长久以来给予老挝大量的“援助”，据公开的数字，美国1955年以来给予老挝的援助达二亿五千万美元，按平均人口计算，老挝是世界上获得美国“援助”最多的国家。但是在上述二亿五千万美“援”中，有一亿七千万美元是军事援助，其余是奢侈品和剩余物资，这些货物大量向老挝倾销，扼杀了老挝本国的生产。评论说，这些“援助”除了给一小撮老挝卖国反动分子带来一些残羹剩饭之外，别人得到些什么呢？相反的，美帝国主义借此而操纵了老挝，在老挝建立军事基地，在老挝制造内战、“扫荡”、死亡和与日俱增的痛苦。
    评论说，最近，政变委员会推翻富米·诺萨万—昭·松萨尼特反动集团以后，美国统治集团威胁说要重新考虑对老挝的“援助”政策。这一点并不足为奇，因为大家都知道，美国向来惯用的手法是，当受“援”国家发生任何不利于美国的变化时，美国就以重新考虑对这个国家的“援助”来向这个国家施加压力。
    评论指出，美国虽然非常狡猾，但它没有看到当前的国际形势已经大大地改变了，它忘记了：除了带有侵略和剥削性质的美国“援助”外，还有社会主义国家的无私的真心诚意的援助，后一种援助曾经帮助许多经济不发达的国家发展自主的经济，以巩固这些国家的政治独立。评论列举了柬埔寨、古巴等国不屈从于“美援”的压力，而接受了社会主义国家的无私援助，克服了困难，发展了民族经济并且因而提高了国家的国际地位的事实后说，这些事实说明，没有美国的“援助”，我们绝不会被置于死地。相反的，任何一个弱小国家，只要全力以赴地建设自己的国家，实行真正的和平中立政策，接受所有国家不带任何条件的援助，那么这个国家一定会得到许多朋友的无私援助，能够坚持独立和提高自己的国际地位。
    新华社河内21日电　据越南通讯社援引“寮国之声电台”的消息报道，许多仍然受富米·诺萨万指挥的老挝王国军队的官兵对于反动集团的命令表示极为愤慨。电台报道，驻扎在万象省沙拉坎地区的许多老挝王国军队士兵向人民投诚。他们对人们说，“如果反动的指挥官命令他们的士兵向寮国的兄弟们或者万象的兄弟们开枪的话，许多人将就地倒戈向这些指挥官射击。”电台说，在桑德，老挝王国军队的官兵强烈反对反动的奔探中尉的命令，结果奔探不得不逃跑。
