Column: New Developments with Cadres Working in the Fields

    With late autumn sowing just completed, the Party Committee of Hancheng Commune in Yiyang County, Henan Province, made a decision: more than 80% of the full-time cadres in the commune would be sent down to the grassroots to settle down, everyone would have labor tools, experimental canteens, and key high-yield plots and key production teams, to grasp production with one hand and life with the other.

    The Commune Party Committee Office was also divided into three groups: one to summarize and disseminate advanced experiences in advanced areas, and one to go to areas with weak work to solve current problems in depth. After this decision was implemented, great changes took place in all aspects of the commune. The following stories are just a few of the countless examples of cadres going deep into production, participating in production and leading production, and meticulously caring for the lives of the masses.

    Tang Linzi Visits "Master Farmer"
    "Who is the expert in farming here?" Tang Linzi, the civil affairs section chief of the commune who had worked as a hired laborer for twelve years, asked this question as soon as he arrived at his new job – Fengjian Brigade, immediately after putting down his luggage. He thought to himself, this time I must make good friends with some farmers, take experienced old peasants as teachers, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and lead production in a down-to-earth manner. He asked many people in a row, and they all said that the best at farming was Zhou Genzi from the Second Production Team. Zhou Genzi was already over fifty years old and had worked as a hired laborer for twenty-eight years. People called him "Master Farmer."

    After making preliminary arrangements for his work at the brigade headquarters, Tang Linzi carried his luggage to the Second Team. After understanding the situation, he learned that Zhou Genzi had been at the forefront of every task during the land reform and the establishment of mutual aid teams and agricultural cooperatives, and he would immediately point out any problems with the village's production to the cadres. However, once, the team set the quota for weeding too high, and he said that deep weeding and careful weeding, one time was equivalent to two, and high quotas would affect deep plowing and careful cultivation. One cadre disagreed with him, calling him "old-fashioned" and "old conservative." Since then, he had been unwilling to approach the cadres.

    Tang Linzi was determined to get close to this "Master Farmer." However, after several visits, Zhou Genzi was unwilling to talk about what was on his mind. One morning, Tang Linzi and Zhou Genzi went to the fields together again. This day, he intentionally started by talking about family matters. When talking about his own background and history, Zhou Genzi said: "No wonder you work so authentically; it turns out you also suffered in the past!" In this way, the two became more and more congenial, and Tang Linzi humbly asked him for advice, asking him how to better organize the current production. On the spot, he made two suggestions to Tang Linzi.

    Afterwards, Tang Linzi also proposed to hold a special meeting of all the team's cadres for discussion, to help the team cadres further promote a democratic work style. At the meeting, he also put forward the idea of "one person makes ten friends, and ten friends connect with a hundred acquaintances." In a few days, all twenty-one Party members and cadres in the team had taken forty-three old peasants as teachers and made one hundred and sixty friends, consulting with the masses in everything.

### 汤林子拜访“庄稼通”

专栏：干部下田新事多

    晚秋播种刚刚结束，河南宜阳县韩城公社党委会作了一项决定：全社80％以上的脱产干部，都下放到基层去安家落户，人人都要有劳动工具，有试验食堂，有重点丰产方和重点生产队，一手抓生产，一手抓生活。
    公社党委办公室也分为三个组，到先进地区总结传播先进经验，到工作薄弱地区深入解决当前的问题。这项决定贯彻以后，全社各个方面都发生了很大变化。写在下面的几个故事，是干部深入生产以后，参加生产领导生产，细致的关心群众生活的无数事例中的几个。
    汤林子拜访“庄稼通”
    “你们这里谁是做庄稼的能手？”扛过十二年长工的公社民政股长汤林子，一来到他的新工作岗位——丰涧大队，刚刚放下行李，便提出了这一问题。他心想，这次一定要好好结交几个农民朋友，拜做庄稼有经验的老农为师，虚心听取群众意见，踏踏实实的领导生产。他接连问过好多人，都说论做活要数第二生产队的周根子。周根子已经五十多岁了，扛过二十八年长工，人称“庄稼通”。
    汤林子在大队部初步安排了一下工作，便扛着行李来到了第二队。经过了解，周根子在土地改革和开始搞互助组、农业社时样样工作都跑到前面，看到村里的生产有一点不对，都马上向干部提出来。只是有一次，队里把锄地的定额定高了，他说深锄、细锄，一遍顶两遍，定额高了就会影响深耕细作，一个干部不同意他的意见，说他是“老脑筋”、“老保守”。从此，他就不愿意和干部接近了。
    汤林子下定决心要同这个“庄稼通”接近。但是几次访问，周根子都不愿谈心里话。一天上午，汤林子又和周老汉一块下地，这天他有意从谈家常入手。谈到自己的出身、历史时，周根子说：“怪道你做活这样地道，原来你过去也是受过苦的人啊！”就这样，两人越谈越投机，汤林子虚心向他请教，问他怎样才能把当前的生产组织得更好。当场，他便向汤林子提出了两条建议。
    事后，汤林子又提议专门召开了全队干部会进行讨论，帮助队干部进一步发扬民主作风。会上，他还提出：“一人交十友，十友联百朋”的意见。不几天，全队二十一个党员和干部，便拜了四十三个老农为师，交了一百六十个朋友，事事都和群众商量。（附图片）
