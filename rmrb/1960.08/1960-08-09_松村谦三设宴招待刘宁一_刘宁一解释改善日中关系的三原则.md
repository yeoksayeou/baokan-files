Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 8th: Matsumura Kenzō, a leader of the anti-mainstream faction within the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, held a banquet on the evening of the 7th to entertain Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation attending the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Complete Disarmament.

Zhao Puchu, the deputy head of the delegation, also attended the banquet.

During the banquet, Liu Ningyi explained to Matsumura Kenzō the three principles for improving Sino-Japanese relations, namely: the Japanese government should not implement a policy of hostility towards China; it should not follow the United States in creating a "Two Chinas" conspiracy; and it should not obstruct or undermine the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

Liu Ningyi also said that after the abrogation of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the prevention of the revival of Japanese militarism, China and Japan could coexist peacefully and could sign a treaty of non-aggression.

Matsumura Kenzō emphasized the importance of Sino-Japanese friendship for peace in Asia and the world, and expressed his hope to strengthen people-to-people exchanges and restore normal relations between the two countries as soon as possible.

The banquet was held in a friendly atmosphere.
