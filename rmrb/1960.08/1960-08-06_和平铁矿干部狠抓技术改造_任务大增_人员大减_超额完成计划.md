Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Electric Dispatch: After technological transformation, the Peace Iron Mine in Dongfeng County, Jilin Province, has gradually moved towards standardized production. The mine's production tasks for this year have increased by nearly one compared to last year, while the number of production personnel has decreased from 6,500 last year to 1,300. Under these circumstances, the mine exceeded the state plan by 12.3% in the first half of the year; the production situation in July was also very good, making it a red banner for technological transformation of small mines in the province.

This year, the mine's Party committee steadfastly led all mine workers to carry out a technical innovation and technical revolution campaign. The Party committee focused on the mine's high labor intensity, low production efficiency, and weak links such as drilling, blasting, loading, unloading, and transportation. It sent leading cadres to the mines to innovate alongside the workers. Mine Director Song Xiangshan, together with the workers, used waste materials and wood to create seven locally-made and foreign-combined winches, freeing the lifting workers from heavy manual labor of pushing and carrying. Transportation work has basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization. Under the leadership of Party Secretary Li Yuchun, the workers replaced ball mills with stone rollers used for oil extraction and used old car tires to make spiral concentrators, building a local concentrator in fifteen days. After the crushed ore is washed and concentrated by this concentrator, the iron content increases from about 25% to more than 60%. According to statistics, in the first half of the year, the masses created 65 types of advanced tools and equipment, totaling more than 450 pieces, thus completing the original three-year plan for transforming production equipment two and a half years ahead of schedule. 76.5% of the mine's workers have been freed from heavy manual labor such as carrying poles and earthen baskets, achieving mechanized lifting and transportation, and greatly improving labor efficiency. At present, the average daily work efficiency of each mining worker in the mine has increased from the original 0.5 tons to 2.1 tons, with a maximum of 5 tons. In the first half of the year, the overall efficiency increased four times compared to the same period last year, and the ore cost was reduced by 61%.

The mine also implemented a "six-down-the-mine" system for management work, that is, mechanical repair, material supply, planning and statistics, living welfare, and office work for leading cadres were all moved to the mine to be done. The reform of management work has also promoted the technological transformation and mineral production of the entire mine.

### 和平铁矿干部狠抓技术改造  任务大增　人员大减　超额完成计划

    和平铁矿干部狠抓技术改造
    任务大增　人员大减　超额完成计划
    新华社长春电　吉林省东丰县和平铁矿经过技术改造，已逐步走向正规生产。全矿今年的生产任务比去年增加将近一倍，而生产人员却由去年的六千五百人减到一千三百人。在这种情况下，全矿上半年超额12.3％完成了国家计划；7月份生产情况也很好，成为全省小型矿山技术改造的一面红旗。
    这个矿的党委，今年踏踏实实地领导全矿职工，开展了技术革新和技术革命运动。党委抓住这个矿劳动强度高、生产效率低及凿岩、爆破、装卸、搬运等薄弱环节，派出领导干部到井下和工人一同搞革新。矿长宋祥山和工人一起，利用废料和木料，先后制成七台土洋结合的卷扬机，使提升工人摆脱了人推、肩抬的笨重体力劳动，搬运工作基本上实现了搬运机械化、半机械化。工人们在党委书记李玉春的带领下，以榨油用的石碾子代替球磨机，利用旧汽车轮胎，制成了螺旋式选矿机，在十五天内建起了一座土选矿厂。碎矿石经过这个选矿厂洗选以后，含铁量由原来的25％左右提高到60％以上。据统计，今年上半年群众创造出来的先进工具和设备达六十五种四百五十多件，因而提前两年半完成了原订三年完成的改造生产设备的规划；全矿76.5％的工人摆脱了扁担、土篮等笨重体力劳动，实现了提升、搬运机械化，劳动效率大大提高。目前，全矿每个采矿工每天的工效平均由原来的零点五吨，提高到了二点一吨，最高达到五吨；上半年全员效率比去年同期提高了四倍，矿石成本降低了61％。
    这个矿还实行了管理工作“六下井”制度，即机械修理、材料供应、计划统计、生活福利、领导干部办公等工作，都搬到井下去做。管理工作的改革，也促进了全矿技术改造和矿产量的提高。
