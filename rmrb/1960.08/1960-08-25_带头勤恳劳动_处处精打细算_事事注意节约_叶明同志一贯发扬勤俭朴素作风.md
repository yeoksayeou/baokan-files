    This newspaper reports that Ye Ming, the Party Branch Secretary of Qingfen Management District of the Dongfanghong People's Commune in Wuhan, has consistently paid attention to promoting a spirit of hard work, diligence, and frugality in leading and organizing the production and life of the entire management district, which has powerfully promoted production and improved living standards. Her excellent work and lifestyle have become a model for the broad masses of cadres and people to learn from.

    Ye Ming is a housewife who grew up in a poor environment and is now fifty-one years old. Over the past ten years, she has responded to the Party's call to actively participate in street work. In her work, she has conscientiously implemented the Party's policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, managing households diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. She deeply understands that to build socialist buildings, one must cherish every brick and tile. Therefore, she pays attention to saving in everything and never wastes anything. Especially after serving as the Party Branch Secretary of the Qingfen Management District of the Dongfanghong People's Commune, she paid even more attention to promoting the spirit of hard work, diligence, and frugality. In the autumn of 1958, she took the lead in establishing the first civilian-run leather shoe factory in Qingfen Street. Without houses or tools, she discussed and brainstormed solutions with the masses, vacated vacant halls, and took out her own benches, scissors, needles, thread, and other items to encourage everyone to overcome difficulties with meager resources. By piecing things together without spending much money, they set up the factory and quickly produced batches of products for the country. Under her leadership and promotion, this street quickly established several factories, including a spray paint factory, a water and electricity installation factory, and a pen repair shop, which played a very good role in supporting national construction and facilitating the people's lives.

    After the street factories were established, she often went to the factories to participate in production labor with the workers, solve problems in production, and often educated the workers to cherish public property and pay attention to diligence and thrift at all times. For example, when the pen repair factory's production began to develop, they planned to add a workbench, which required an expenditure of more than one hundred yuan. After Ye Ming learned about it, she took the initiative to consult with the workers, looked for alternative materials, and spent thirty-five yuan to buy a large meat cutting stool to modify, which was completely suitable.

    In organizing people's economic life, she also adhered to the principle of diligence and thrift. When running the canteen, without stoves or utensils, she went with the masses to haul mud and sand, took the lead in building stoves, and mobilized the masses to lend their surplus bowls, chopsticks, and utensils to the canteen. Finally, they overcame the difficulties and established a street canteen, which solved the problem of meals for many housewives participating in production. On weekdays, she also paid attention to saving every bit and accumulating small savings. When she found some broken bricks in the streets and alleys, she paid attention to collecting them for repairing houses. In the canteen, sometimes she found that the stove was not sealed after use, she helped the canteen staff calculate savings accounts, discussed saving methods, and eliminated waste. Some workers and street residents were not good at arranging their lives, she repeatedly introduced to them the benefits and methods of managing their households diligently and thriftily, so that everyone developed good habits of diligence and thrift. Under her leadership and promotion, the masses in the entire management district implemented the principle of diligence and thrift in establishing life service stations, kindergartens, and other work, and did many things without spending money or spending less money.

    Ye Ming has also always maintained a diligent and simple style in her life, never spending a penny indiscriminately, never wasting a grain of grain, resolutely not buying things that are not needed, and not easily buying things that are needed. Although her husband, son, and daughter-in-law all participate in work and have a relatively affluent economy, she still insists on careful calculation, living a rich life as a poor life, and saves the money saved every month in the bank to support national construction.

    Ye Ming's diligent and simple style has had a good impact on the masses. "Learn from Secretary Ye, do as Secretary Ye does" has become the slogan of the masses. In the street factories, service stations, consignment stores, kindergartens, and canteens of Qingfen Management District, it has become a common practice to be diligent and thrifty and not waste the country's money or grains of rice.

    带头勤恳劳动　处处精打细算　事事注意节约
    叶明同志一贯发扬勤俭朴素作风
    本报讯　武汉市东方红人民公社清芬管理区党总支书记叶明，在领导、组织全管理区的生产和生活中，一贯注意发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭朴素的作风，有力地推动了生产并改善了生活。她的优良的工作和生活作风，已成为广大干部和群众学习的榜样。
    叶明是在贫苦的环境中成长的家庭妇女，今年已经五十一岁。十年来，她响应党的号召，积极参加街道工作，在工作中认真贯彻党的勤俭建国、勤俭持家、勤俭办一切事业的方针，深深懂得要盖社会主义的大楼房，就得爱惜一砖一瓦的道理，因此事事注意节省，从不浪费。特别是在担任东方红人民公社清芬管理区总支书记后，她更注意发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭朴素的精神。1958年秋天，她带头在清芬街办全街第一座民办皮鞋工厂。没有房子和工具，她就和群众一起商量、想办法，动手腾出空闲的堂屋，拿出自己家里的板凳、剪刀、针、线等物品，带动大家用穷办法克服困难，拼拼凑凑不花什么钱，就把工厂办起来了，并很快就为国家生产出成批的产品。在她的领导和带动下，这个街道克勤克俭，很快就举办了喷漆工厂、水电安装工厂、钢笔修理厂等几个工厂，在支援国家建设和方便群众等方面，起了很好的作用。
    街道工厂办起来以后，她经常到工厂里，和工人一起参加生产劳动，解决生产中的问题，还经常教育工人随时随地爱护公家财物，注意勤俭节约。如钢笔修理厂职工在生产开始有了发展时，打算添制一张工作台，需要一百多元的开支。叶明知道后，就主动和职工商量，找代用材料，花三十五元买了一个切肉的大板凳来加以改装，完全适用。
    在组织人民经济生活中，她也坚持了勤俭节约的原则。办食堂时，没有炉灶、用具，她就和群众一起去拖运泥沙，带头动手搭炉灶，发动群众把家里多余的碗筷用具借给食堂用，终于克服了困难，办起了街道食堂，解决了许多参加生产的家庭妇女的吃饭问题。在平日，她还注意点滴节约、积少成多。发现街头巷尾有些破砖，她就注意收集起来，作为修理房屋之用。在食堂里，有时发现炉灶用后没有封火，她就帮助食堂工作人员算节约账，商量节约办法，杜绝了浪费现象。一部分工人和街道居民不善于安排生活，她就反复向他们介绍勤俭持家的好处和办法，使大家养成勤俭节约的良好习惯。在她的领导和带动下，全管理区群众在建立生活服务站、幼儿园等工作中，都贯彻了勤俭节约的原则，不花钱或少花钱办了许多事情。
    叶明在生活上也一直保持着勤俭朴素的作风，从不乱花一分钱，不浪费一粒粮食，不需要的东西坚决不买，就是需要的东西也不轻易去买。尽管她的丈夫、儿子、媳妇都参加了工作，经济较宽裕，她仍然坚持精打细算，把富日子当穷日子过，每月都把节约下来的钱存到银行里，支援国家建设。
    叶明的勤俭朴素的作风在群众中产生了良好的影响，“向叶书记学习，照叶书记那样干”已成为群众的行动口号。在清芬管理区的街道工厂、服务站、代销店、幼儿园、食堂里，勤俭节约、不浪费国家分钱粒米已形成风气。（附图片）
