    Enthusiastic and Bold Mongolian Song and Dance Art
    Jia Zuoguang
    We welcome the visiting performance of the Kobdo Provincial Music and Drama Theater Troupe of the Mongolian People's Republic with unparalleled enthusiasm. The wonderful performances of the artists have won warm praise from Chinese audiences. The song and dance art of the Mongolian People's Republic is loved by the Chinese people; Mongolian acrobatics, soft skills, folk dances, and the opera "Three Mountains" have long been seeds of friendship, becoming repertory pieces for some of our art troupes. Especially after the construction of the Moscow-Ulaanbaatar-Beijing friendship route, the friendship and cultural exchange between the Chinese and Mongolian people have become even closer and more frequent. I remember a famous Mongolian song, "The Iron Road," which expressed the lofty friendship between the two peoples:
    The iron road uses eternal friendship,
    To connect us with Moscow and Beijing,
    Bringing us great strength,
    This is a gift of friendship,
    This is the road to socialism.
    Indeed, our friends have brought not only the enthusiastic and bold excellent songs and dances of the Mongolian people from this railway, but also the sincere and profound friendship of the Mongolian people.
    The songs and dances performed by the Mongolian artists this time, with their strong national style, fully express the Mongolian people's wishes for friendship, peace, happiness, and freedom.
    The national instrumental ensemble "Hometown of Altai," "Hometown of Torghut," and "Mongolian People Striving for Peace" are full of revolutionary optimism and peaceful aspirations, expressing the Mongolian people's praise and respect for their motherland's mountains and rivers. Folk dances show the simple character of the Mongolian working people. "Uliyasutai" shows the optimistic, cheerful, and humorous emotions of the western Mongolians, "Torghut" shows the image of women in northern Mongolia who love labor, while "Herdsman's Dance" takes us to the vast and rich grasslands. National meritorious actress Suronghaorlao has a beautiful and moving voice, and her solo strongly infects the audience. In addition, the female chorus, and Gaoteb's solo are also very attractive to the audience. The entire evening's performance left a deep impression on us.
    We sincerely thank the cultural envoys of the Mongolian people. We believe that the Mongolian artists' visit and performance in China will surely be warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Chinese working people. Long live the unbreakable and eternal friendship between China and Mongolia! (Attached picture)

    热情豪放的蒙古歌舞艺术
    贾作光
    我们以无比的热情欢迎蒙古人民共和国科布多省音乐话剧院艺术团访华演出，艺术家们的精彩表演博得中国观众热烈的赞扬。蒙古人民共和国的歌舞艺术是中国人民所喜爱的；蒙古的杂技柔术、民间舞蹈、歌剧“三座山”早已是友谊的种子，成为我国一些艺术团的保留节目。特别是莫斯科—乌兰巴托—北京这条友谊之路建成以后，中蒙两国人民的友谊和文化交流就更加紧密和频繁了。我曾记得蒙古有一首著名的歌曲《钢铁的路》这样表达了两国人民崇高的情谊：
    钢铁的道路用永恒的友谊，
    把我们同莫斯科和北京联系起来，
    给我们带来伟大的力量，
    这是友谊的礼物，
    这是通到社会主义的道路。
    的确，我们的朋友们从这条铁路不仅带来了蒙古人民热情豪放的优秀歌舞，而且带来了蒙古人民诚挚深厚的友谊。
    这次蒙古艺术家们演出的具有浓厚民族风格的歌舞，充分地表现了蒙古人民对于友谊、和平、幸福和自由的愿望。
    民族乐器合奏《阿尔泰故乡》《陶尔古特故乡》《蒙古人民争取和平》充满着革命乐观主义精神和和平愿望，表达了蒙古人民对自己祖国山河的歌颂和崇敬。民间舞蹈显示了蒙古劳动人民纯朴的性格。《乌里扬汗》表现了西部蒙古人那种乐观爽朗幽默的情绪，《陶尔古特》表现了北部蒙古人民热爱劳动的妇女形象，而《牧人舞》却把我们带到辽阔富饶的大草原中去了。国家功勋演员苏荣郝尔劳有着美妙动听的歌喉，她的独唱强烈地感染着观众。此外，女声小合唱，高特布的独唱等也都是很吸引观众的。整个晚会表演给我们留下了很深的印象。
    我们由衷地感谢蒙古人民的文化使者。我们相信，蒙古艺术家们在中国的访问演出一定会受到中国广大劳动人民的热烈欢迎。中蒙两国牢不可破的永恒友谊万岁！（附图片）
