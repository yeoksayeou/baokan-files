"Class Monitor"
    Liu Anqi

    It's only been half a year since I came home, and the changes are truly enormous! Especially those old neighbors; I almost didn't recognize them at first. I never would have imagined that Granny Li, nicknamed "Scolding Half the Street," is now the warm-hearted head of the service station. And "Lazy Sister-in-law," once known far and wide, is now praised by everyone as a good auntie… But what surprised me most was that Sister Fengying had actually become a "class monitor"!

    Sister Fengying, with her slender figure and oval face, was the prettiest young wife in our neighborhood. When she first married, she loved to sing and dance, and was always a "public figure" known for her enthusiasm. But before long, year after year, she had five children, some tall and some short, in seven years. She was so exhausted from cleaning up after them all day long that she couldn't even stand up straight. Especially when she went out, the children would follow her, making a racket and constantly surrounding her. Everyone would joke and call her "Class Monitor," and Sister Fengying would just grin wryly…

    But now, after only half a year, the alley really seems to have "changed its face." Fengying has truly become a well-known "class monitor"! It turns out that when the commune was established, the Party sent her to the power plant to "study" for two months. Now, she's leading a "female warrior" team, the "Electrician Class." They handle all the electrical work in the commune. Last night, our house's light broke, and Mom gave her a call. Before long, she arrived with seven or eight female workers on bicycles. When I saw her, I was stunned and couldn't even greet her for a while. It was clearly a spirited young woman standing before me!

    "Niu'er, you're home!" she called me by my childhood name.

    "Oh, it really is, Monitor Fengying?" I asked tentatively.

    "You don't recognize me? You're too high and mighty to notice things, haha…" she joked.

    "Hey, if you hadn't called me, I really wouldn't have recognized you!" I said. "You look so much younger!"

    "It's not just me. Since the commune was established, every young wife in the neighborhood looks ten years younger! Even your grandma, at eighty years old, is happily performing the yangko dance, haha!" she laughed so happily.

    "Where are your 'little soldiers'?" I asked, puzzled.

    "They're at the nursery," she said.

    That evening, the commune's club was showing the movie "A Riot of Colors is Always Spring." I ran into her again on the way. She was followed by her children, each with clean clothes and rosy cheeks. They swung their arms high behind their mother, marching with spirit. Sister Fengying tapped her foot to the beat, singing the song etched in her heart: "The people's commune is good, the red flag rises to the sky..."

    The "little soldiers" followed along, singing: "The people's commune is good, the red flag rises to the sky..."

    Watching this ordinary scene from life, my heart was filled with happiness. Gazing at Sister Fengying's slender figure from behind, I said softly: Blessings to our class monitor!

    “班长”
    刘安琪
    半年没回家，变化可真大呀！尤其是那些老街坊，乍见面都不敢认了。我连想都没有想到，外号“骂半街”的李婆婆，如今是热心热肠的服务站长；远近驰名的“懒大嫂”，现在是众人夸奖的好阿姨了……。特别令我吃惊的是，凤英姐真的当上“班长”啦！
    凤英姐，苗条的身段，瓜子脸，是我们街道上第一个俊俏媳妇。刚过门时，爱唱爱跳，工作积极，一贯是“抛头露面”的红人儿。可没隔多久，一年一年地，七年功夫就七高八低地养了五个孩子。整天屎哇尿哇，累得她直不起腰来。特别是在她出门时，后面跟着孩子们吵吵嚷嚷直围着她转。大伙见了就开玩笑地喊她“班长”，凤英姐听了只是咧嘴苦笑……
    可是而今，仅仅隔了半年，小巷里真像“换了人间”，凤英当真成了响叮当的“班长”啦！原来公社成立时，党派她到电厂去“留学”两月，现在已带着一帮“穆桂英”组成的“电工班”了。社里有什么电工活计，她们都一手包下。昨晚我家电灯坏了，妈妈给她拨了个电话，没有多大功夫，她就领着七八个女工骑着自行车来了。刚一见，我楞的够呛，半天没敢招呼，我眼前不明明是个神气充沛的年轻姑娘嘛。
    “牛儿，回家啦！”她喊我小名。
    “呵，您真是，班长嫂？”我试探地问。
    “不认识了？真是贵人眼大呀，哈哈……”她开玩笑地说。
    “哎，要不是你喊我，我可真认不出来了！”我说，“看你变得多年轻呐！”
    “不单是我，公社一成立，街头巷尾哪门媳妇没年轻十岁？就连你家奶奶，八十岁了还乐的扭秧歌哩，哈哈！”她笑得多开心呐。
    “你那群‘小兵’呢？”我纳罕地问。
    “进托儿所啦。”她说。
    晚上，公社俱乐部放电影《万紫千红总是春》，我在半路上又碰见了她，她后面跟着孩子们，一个个衣服都是干干净净的，小脸蛋白里还透红，在妈妈身后把胳膊儿甩的老高，迈着正步神气十足地走着。凤英姐用脚打着节拍，敞开嗓子唱起心坎上印着的歌子：“人民公社好哇，红旗升上天……”
    后面的“小兵”们也跟着唱道：“人民公社好哇，红旗升上天……”
    我看着这生活中一个普通的镜头，心里充满了幸福的感情，望着凤英姐苗条的背影，我轻轻地说：祝福，我们的班长！
