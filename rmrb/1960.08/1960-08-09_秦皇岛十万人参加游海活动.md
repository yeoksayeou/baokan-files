Located on the Bohai Sea coast, Qinhuangdao City, Hebei Province, held a mobilization meeting for 100,000 people to participate in sea swimming activities on July 24. In addition to members of rural and urban people's communes, factory and mine workers, government cadres, students, and officers and soldiers of the armed forces, the activities were also attended by national model workers, advanced workers, and international friends recuperating here from all over the country.

The meeting was held simultaneously on the beaches of Qinhuangdao City, Beidaihe, and Shanhaiguan. The main venue was located in the urban area. Starting from 10:00 AM, participants in the sea swimming activities flocked to the various seaside bathing beaches from all directions in groups, with red flags fluttering and in a mighty procession. At 1:00 PM, the meeting began, and Li Yuezhi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Qinhuangdao Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a speech. He summarized the achievements of mass sports activities since the beginning of summer and further emphasized the significance of carrying out swimming activities. Then, the sea swimming activity began. The Municipal Party Secretary and the Mayor took the lead in entering the water, followed by the 100,000-strong sea swimming army, and suddenly waves splashed and the blue sea boiled.

Mass sea swimming activities were varied: some were playing water polo, others were participating in tug-of-war in the water; beginners were practicing some simple postures on the shore; and experts were swimming in the deep. Athletes from the Municipal Sailing Club performed water motorcycle, nautical multiple events, and 3,000-meter swimming events.

    秦皇岛十万人参加游海活动
    地处渤海滨的河北省秦皇岛市于7月24日举行了十万人游海动员大会。参加大会活动的，除城乡人民公社社员、厂矿职工、机关干部、学生、部队官兵外，还有在这里疗养的全国各地劳动模范、先进工作者和国际友人。
    大会分别在秦皇岛市区、北戴河和山海关三处的海边同时举行。中心会场设在市区。由上午十时起，参加游海活动的人们就成群结队、从四面八方涌向各个海边浴场，红旗招展，浩浩荡荡。下午一时大会开始，中共秦皇岛市委书记处书记李越之同志首先讲话。他概括总结了入夏以来群众性体育运动的成绩，进一步强调了开展游泳运动的意义。接着，游海活动开始。市委书记、市长带头下水，紧跟着十万游海大军一齐出动，顿时浪花四溅，碧海沸腾。
    群众性的游海活动多种多样：有打水球的；有水中拔河赛；初学者在岸边比划一些简单的姿势；熟手们在深处遨游。市航海俱乐部的运动员们表演了水上摩托、航海多项、三千米游泳等项目。
