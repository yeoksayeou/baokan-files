How We Lead Road-Mine Collaboration
Qiu Xinye, First Secretary of the CPC Fuxin Municipal Committee

The experience of road-mine collaboration created by Fuxin City in 1958 has been continuously improved over the past year, with the continuous leap forward in coal production and railway transportation.

Adhere to Politics in Command

Fuxin is one of the important coal industrial bases in China, and the tasks of coal production and railway transportation are quite heavy. In November 1958, the amount of "landed coal" mined in Fuxin City but not transported out in time reached 1.5 million tons. This threatened the growth of coal production and caused great losses and waste. At that time, the time spent by vehicles at Fuxin Station was as long as 14 hours. This situation of railway transportation lagging behind coal production forced us to vigorously promote a high-yield movement in railway transportation. As a result, bad things turned into good things, and the experience of road-mine collaboration was created. Practice over the past year has proved that coal production and railway transportation restrict and promote each other. High coal production forces railways to transport quickly; high railway transportation promotes the continued improvement of coal production and quality. Based on this mutually restrictive and mutually promoting relationship between the two, the municipal party committee can achieve the goal of producing more coal and transporting it quickly, and a double leap forward in production and transportation, by grasping both coal production and railway transportation with both hands.

To achieve a leap forward in transportation work, it is necessary to first strengthen the leadership of the Party, especially ideological leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, constantly boost morale, and implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. In 1959, according to the situation of the production leap forward and the possibility of a transportation leap forward, the municipal party committee required the station's one-time operation time to reach 6 hours. Some comrades believed that this was impossible and advocated taking it slowly, saying that "reaching seven and a half hours would be good," and so on. Obviously, without clearing up these thoughts and views, transportation could not leap forward. The municipal party committee organized transportation departments to hold cadre meetings, symposiums, and mass debates to overcome these erroneous views. Everyone realized that whether transportation can keep up is a crucial key to whether production can leap forward. To keep up with transportation, we must never take it slowly. If we do not strive for the upper reaches ideologically and let conservative thinking take command, the result will inevitably be less, slower, worse, and more expensive results; if we strive for the upper reaches ideologically and let progressive thinking take command, and act according to Marxist-Leninist viewpoints and methods, and rely on the wisdom and strength of the broad masses, the result will inevitably be more, faster, better, and more economical results. Facts speak louder than words. In July of this year, the station stop time at Fuxin Station was shortened to 4.5 hours, which powerfully criticized conservative thinking.

In carrying out each transportation technology transformation, we adhered to putting politics in command and carried out the struggle between two ideologies to ensure the victory of progressive thinking. In daily transportation work, we also constantly guarded against the emergence of slack emotions, especially when work had achieved results. At the beginning of February of this year, the average one-time operation time of Fuxin Station rose to 7.2 hours, an increase of 1.3 hours compared with January. With conditions getting better and better, why did the operation time increase instead? We promptly noticed that the main reason at that time was that some cadres had developed complacency and slack emotions. They thought that the one-time operation time had been cut by about half compared with 1958, that they had created a lot of experience, and that the work was almost done, so they were not so motivated and the collaboration was not as good as before. This was a new conservative thought that emerged under the new situation. The municipal party committee discovered this situation and pointed out in time that this was a serious obstacle to the continued leap forward in transportation. The secretary of the municipal party committee went to the scene, participated in symposiums, and told cadres and the masses of workers about the situation, pointed out the direction, and assigned tasks, so that everyone clearly realized that if the upper reaches do not strive again and again, they will fall into the middle and lower reaches, and if transportation does not leap again and again, it will affect production. A large-scale airing of views, debates, and big-character posters once again broke conservative thinking, and transportation and production once again reached new peaks.

This series of facts proves that the process of transportation leap forward is a process of strengthening the leadership of the Party and constantly opposing conservative thinking. Conservative thinking is a stumbling block on the road to the Great Leap Forward. Only by removing this ideological obstacle can we leap forward in great strides.

In strengthening transportation work, the municipal party committee always adhered to political and ideological leadership and insisted on putting politics in command, thereby making road-mine workers feel happy and energetic. This kind of energy is a huge force generated by the combination of the Party Central Committee's policies and Chairman Mao's guiding ideology and the broad masses, and it is a reliable guarantee for sustained leap forward. In the process of vigorously carrying out mass movements, many old technical theories that were once regarded as classics were overthrown, more than 1,000 unreasonable rules and regulations that constrained production were broken, and many new, Chinese-style technical theories on transportation organization and new rules and regulations for developing transportation productivity were created. Facts once again proved the great significance of Chairman Mao's teachings on breaking superstitions, liberating thinking, continuous revolution, and that political work is the lifeline of economic work.

Grasp Firmly, Meticulously, and Focus on Major Contradictions

The reason why Fuxin's road-mine collaboration experience in improving transportation can continue to develop is also because the municipal party committee grasped this work relatively firmly, meticulously, and quickly, and concentrated its efforts to solve the main contradictions in a certain period.

The municipal party committee paid attention to discovering new things and promptly and vigorously supported the continuous growth and strengthening of new things. For example, by grasping the experience of developing "Red Flag Trains," the problem of long stopover times at stations was solved. However, coal production increased again, and the contradiction between transportation and production became more acute. In order to solve this contradiction, we organized and mobilized the city and the broad masses of road-mine workers to vigorously promote a mass movement for mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading; later, we organized the overall transformation of station lines, as well as the construction of five-level automatic coal storage and loading lines and the second overall transformation of lines. Some people worried that continuous revolution would disrupt the normal order of transportation. In fact, only by disrupting the old order that restricts the development of productive forces can a new order that develops productive forces be established. For example, before November 1958, the stopover time of vehicles at Fuxin Station was 14 hours. Now, more than 1,000 old rules and regulations have been broken and more than 800 new rules and regulations have been established, and the station stop time has been shortened to 4.5 hours. The development of all things often proceeds along the formula of balance - imbalance - balance. We must both recognize the inevitability of imbalance and actively carry out balance work, that is, through people's subjective efforts, promote things to a new balance. In the process of constantly organizing new balances, we must firmly grasp the main contradictions and solve them practically and meticulously.

Many of the major technical transformations in production and transportation had no precedents to follow, and mainly relied on our leaders at all levels to rely well on the strength of the masses and fully develop the spirit of initiative of the masses through "three combinations." The characteristics of Fuxin City's five transportation technology revolutions are that they conscientiously implemented the policy of "walking on two legs," "relying mainly on self-reliance and striving for foreign aid as a supplement," and adopted the method of concentrating superior forces to fight battles of annihilation. For example, when building coal storage and loading equipment, more than 3,000 people were organized and mobilized throughout the city to participate, and various aspects were organized to support it in terms of financial and material resources. As a result, 12 coal storage and loading equipment were completed in half a year. Another characteristic of the five transportation technology revolutions is that in the process of the first revolution, the problems of the second revolution were foreseen, and preparations were made for the second revolution; at the end of the first revolution, forces were immediately organized and mobilized to vigorously promote the second revolution. Such continuous revolution and continuous leap forward, with one battle after another, advancing wave after wave, formed a new situation in which the mass movement was surging and transportation experience emerged in endlessly.

Combine Vigorous Mass Movements with Centralized Leadership

The continuous improvement of transportation efficiency requires us to strengthen organizational leadership in transportation command. In order to strengthen the centralized command of transportation work, in addition to a secretary of the municipal party committee being assigned to manage it, the municipal party committee established a transportation command headquarters, composed of a deputy director of the mining bureau and party committee secretaries and directors of both the road and mine, to strengthen collective leadership. This command headquarters specializes in managing railway transportation work. It is a powerful combat command headquarters, which, like combat, commands transportation work in a timely manner. Due to working day and night shifts, it has achieved three grasps a day and three grasps a month for station transportation: grasping trains, grasping every moment, and grasping every shift, which is three grasps a day; grasping a good start at the beginning of the month, grasping daily redness during ordinary times, and grasping redness to the end at the end of the month, and preparing for the next month, which is three grasps a month.

In terms of improving leadership methods and changing leadership styles, the secretaries and directors of the municipal party committee and the mining bureau in charge of transportation have, since January of this year, held one or two mass joint conferences (including road-mine workers and workers of relevant unloading enterprises) each month, which go to the end, and held three meetings separately according to three shifts. At this type of meeting, on the one hand, the secretary of the municipal party committee and the director of the mining bureau informed the workers of the situation and assigned tasks, so that the Party's intentions could go to the end; on the other hand, the workers were allowed to air their views freely, and the leaders of the road, mine, and factory expressed their attitudes and solved problems face to face. Because railway transportation has both production, transportation, and sales relationships with factories and mines and various enterprise departments, as well as loading, unloading, and transportation relationships, and has both collaborative relationships and restrictive relationships, stringing various complex relationships into one line and twisting them into one rope is an extremely meticulous, complex, and arduous organizational work. This type of meeting can not only play the role of organizing and mobilizing all enterprises in the city to cooperate in a "one-dragon" transportation, but also play the role of leaders contacting the masses and workers participating in management. Because the relationships in all aspects are intricate and complex, some problems have not been resolved for several years. Now, the city leaders directly participate and solve them easily through this type of meeting, and the workers are particularly happy. Through this type of meeting, the workers feel that they are both producers and managers, and their sense of responsibility has also been strengthened. They not only actively complete their own tasks, but also do a good job in collaborative relationships.

Over the past year, the municipal party committee has also explored this experience in leading transportation work: it is not enough to have only internal "one-dragon" transportation cooperation; it is also necessary to have external "one-dragon" transportation cooperation. Because simply shortening the stopover time of vehicles at Fuxin will not comprehensively improve transportation capacity. Therefore, the municipal party committee decided to organize "circular dragon cars" between Fuxin and Shenyang, Anshan, and Dalian. The Fuxin Transportation Command Headquarters organized several groups of people, led by responsible cadres, to go to the above-mentioned stations to hold get-togethers, and the stations also came to Fuxin to hold get-togethers, and agreed on the "circular dragon car" agreement. The "circular dragon car" from Fuxin to Shenyang directly reaches the special line for unloading through Shenyang Station without being disassembled and grouped, shortening the stopover time of vehicles at Shenyang Station from 15 hours in the past to 3 hours. The "circular dragon car" from Fuxin to Anshan shortens the unloading time in Anshan by half. This is a new development of "one-dragon" transportation cooperation. Through this practice, everyone has received a very profound education, and everyone regards cooperation as glorious and sees localism as shameful. The communist style of putting others before oneself and selflessness has become a conscious action of the masses. At the beginning, some comrades at Fuxin Station did not understand, saying that opening "circular dragon cars" would lengthen our station stop time and we would suffer losses. The Fuxin Station Party Committee called on the workers to calculate the big picture and not the small picture. For example, the "circular dragon car" opened to Shenyang waited an extra one and a half hours at Fuxin Station, but reduced nine hours for Shenyang Station. After such a calculation, the workers were inspired by the soaring energy of selflessness. In order to supply Shenyang, Anshan, and other places with the coal they needed in a timely manner, Fuxin Station brought the station line distribution map of Shenyang Station to ensure that "circular dragon cars" continued to drive to various parts of southern Liaoning. The style of the Fuxin road-mine workers was warmly welcomed by Shenyang and Anshan.

For more than a year, Fuxin's transportation technology revolution, transportation organization revolution, and ideological revolution have been closely integrated. Because according to the requirements of the rapid development of productive forces, the relations of production and the superstructure must be continuously reformed and adjusted in order to open up a broad road for the continuous development of productive forces. Several revolutions are tightly intertwined, mutually conditional, and mutually promoting, converging into a huge revolutionary torrent. This revolutionary torrent has renewed people's mental outlook, made railway transportation work leap forward, and powerfully supported the sustained leap forward of the national economy. We will hold high the red flag of Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution and strive for a greater leap forward in railway transportation!

    我们是怎样领导路矿协作的
    中共阜新市委第一书记　丘新野
    1958年阜新市创造的路矿协作的经验，一年多来，随着煤炭生产和铁路运输的不断跃进，正在不断完善。
    坚持政治挂帅
    阜新是我国煤炭工业的重要基地之一，煤炭生产和铁路运输的任务相当繁重。1958年11月间，阜新市采出来而没有及时运出去的“落地煤”达一百五十万吨之多。它威胁着煤炭生产的增长，损失浪费很大。当时，阜新车站车辆在站停留时间长达十四小时。这种铁路运输落后于煤炭生产的形势，逼着我们大闹铁路运输高产运动。结果坏事变成了好事，创造了路矿协作的经验。一年多来的实践证明，煤炭生产和铁路运输，互相制约，互相促进。煤炭生产高产了，就逼着铁路快运；铁路运输高产了，又促进煤炭产量和质量继续提高。根据二者之间这种互相制约、互相促进的关系，市委一手抓煤炭生产，一手抓铁路运输，就能达到多产煤、快运煤，生产运输双跃进的目的。
    运输工作要跃进，就必须首先加强党的领导，特别是思想领导，坚持政治挂帅，不断鼓干劲，贯彻多快好省的方针。1959年，市委根据生产跃进的形势和运输跃进的可能，要求车站一次作业时间达到6小时。有些同志认为这是不可能作到的，主张慢慢来，说“达到七点五小时就不错了”等等。显然这些思想和观点不清除，运输就不可能跃进。市委组织运输部门开干部会、座谈会和群众的辩论会，克服了这些错误观点。大家认识到运输能否跟上，这是生产能否跃进的一个重要关键。运输要跟上，就决不能慢慢来，如果思想上不力争上游，让保守思想挂帅，结果必然是少慢差费；如果思想上力争上游，让促进思想挂帅，按马列主义观点、方法办事，有广大群众的智慧和力量为依靠，结果必然是多快好省。事实胜于雄辩，今年7月份，阜新车站的站停时间缩短到四点五小时了，这就有力地批判了保守思想。
    在进行每一次运输技术的改造时，我们都坚持了政治挂帅，进行了两种思想的斗争，保证了促进思想的胜利。在日常的运输工作中，我们也时刻警惕松劲情绪的产生，特别是当工作取得成就的时候。今年2月初，阜新车站平均一次作业时间上升到七点二小时，比1月份延长了一点三小时。条件越来越好，为什么作业时间反倒延长了呢？我们及时地察觉到，当时主要是在部分干部中，产生了自满松劲情绪。他们自以为一次作业时间比1958年砍掉一半左右，经验创造了不少，工作差不多了，因此，干劲不那么足了，协作不如从前了。这是在新形势下出现的一种新的保守思想。市委发现这种情况，及时地指出，这是实现运输继续跃进的严重障碍。市委书记到现场，参加座谈会，向干部和职工群众讲形势、指方向、交任务，使大家明确认识到，上游如不一争再争，就会落到中游、下游，运输如不一跃再跃，就会影响生产。一场大鸣大放大辩论，又一次打破保守思想，运输、生产又登上了新的高峰。
    这一系列的事实证明，运输跃进的过程，是一个加强党的领导，不断地反对保守思想的过程。保守思想是大跃进道路上的绊脚石，扫除这个思想障碍，才能大踏步地跃进。
    在加强运输工作中，市委始终坚持政治思想领导，坚持了政治挂帅，从而使路矿职工心情舒畅，干劲冲天。这种干劲是党中央的方针政策和毛主席的指导思想与广大群众相结合而产生的巨大力量，是持续跃进的可靠保证。在大搞群众运动过程中，推翻了许多被人们奉为经典的陈旧的技术理论，破了一千多条束缚生产的不合理的规章制度，创造了许多运输组织学上的新的、中国式的技术理论和发展运输生产力的新的规章制度。事实又一次证明了毛主席教导我们的破除迷信，解放思想，不断革命和政治工作是经济工作的生命线的伟大意义。
    抓狠抓细抓主要矛盾
    阜新路矿协作搞好运输的经验所以能不断发展，还由于市委对这一工作抓得比较狠，抓得比较细，抓得比较快，一个时期集中力量解决主要矛盾。
    市委注意了发现新生事物，及时地大力地支持新生事物不断成长壮大。例如，由于抓住了发展“红旗列车”的经验，解决了在站停留时间长的问题。但煤炭生产又增长了，运输与生产的矛盾又尖锐起来。为了解决这个矛盾，我们就组织动员全市和路矿广大职工，大闹装运机械化、半机械化群众运动；后来又组织站线总体改造，以及修建五条分级自动贮煤装车线和第二次线路总体改造。有些人担心不断革命会打乱正常运输秩序。其实只有束缚生产力的旧秩序打乱了，才能建立发展生产力的新秩序。比如1958年11月以前，阜新车站的车辆在站停留时间为十四小时，现在打破了一千多条旧的规章制度，立了八百多条新的规章制度，站停时间反缩短到四小时半。一切事物的发展，经常沿着平衡——不平衡——平衡的公式前进。我们既要承认不平衡的必然性，又要积极进行平衡工作，也就是经过人的主观努力，促进事物走向新的平衡。在不断组织新的平衡的过程中，要狠狠地抓住主要矛盾，切实细致地加以解决。
    生产、运输一系列的重大的技术改造，很多是没有先例可循的，主要靠我们各级领导很好地依靠群众的力量，通过“三结合”充分发扬群众的首创精神。阜新市五次运输技术革命的特点，都是认真贯彻“两条腿走路”、“自力更生为主、力争外援为辅”的方针，和采取集中优势兵力打歼灭战的办法完成的。如修建贮煤装车设备时，全市组织动员三千多人参加，组织各方面从财力、物力方面支援，结果十二座贮煤装车设备半年完成。五次运输技术革命的另外一个特点是，在第一个革命的过程中，就预见到第二个革命的问题，并为第二个革命作好准备工作；在第一个革命终了时，即紧接着组织动员力量大闹第二个革命。如此的不断革命，不断跃进，一个战役接着一个战役，一浪高一浪地前进，就形成了一个群众运动汹涌澎湃，运输经验层出不穷的崭新局面。
    大搞群众运动和集中领导相结合
    运输效率的不断提高，要求我们在运输指挥上加强组织领导工作。为了加强对运输工作的集中指挥，除市委有一名书记分工管理外，市委成立了运输指挥部，由矿务局一名副局长和路矿双方的党委书记、主任等组成领导核心，加强集体领导。这个指挥部专门管理铁路运输工作。它是一个强有力的战斗司令部，像作战一样，及时地指挥运输工作。由于昼夜值班，作到了对车站运输一日三抓和一月三抓：列列抓，时时抓，班班抓，这是一日三抓；月初抓开门红，平时抓日日红，月末抓红到底和给下月作准备，这是一月三抓。
    在改进领导方法和转变领导作风方面，市委和矿务局分管运输的书记和局长，自今年1月开始，每月召开一、两次一竿子插到底的群众联合大会（包括路矿职工和有关卸车各企业单位的职工在内），按三班制分别召开三次会议。这种会议，一方面由市委书记和矿务局长向职工讲形势，交任务，使党的意图一竿子插到底，另一方面，让工人大鸣大放，畅所欲言，路、矿、厂的领导同志当面表示态度，解决问题。因为铁路运输与厂矿和各企业部门既有产运销的关系，又有装卸运的关系，既有协作关系，又有制约关系，把各种错综复杂的关系，穿成一条线，拧成一股绳，是一个极为细致、复杂、艰巨的组织工作。这种会议既能起到组织动员全市各企业“一条龙”运输大协作的作用，又起到领导联系群众、工人参加管理的作用。由于各方面的关系错综复杂，有一些问题几年没有解决，现在市领导直接参加，通过这种会议迎刃而解，职工们格外愉快。通过这种会议，工人们感到自己既是生产者，又是管理者，责任心也更加强了，既积极完成自己的任务，又搞好协作关系。
    市委一年来领导运输工作，还摸索到这样一条经验：仅有内部“一条龙”运输大协作不够，还要有外部“一条龙”运输大协作。因为仅阜新缩短车辆在站停留时间，还不能全面提高运输能力。所以市委决定在阜新与沈阳、鞍山、旅大之间组织“循环龙车”。阜新运输指挥部组织了几批人，由负责干部率领，去以上各站进行联欢，各站也来阜新联欢，彼此商定了“循环龙车”的协议。由阜新开往沈阳的“循环龙车”，经过沈阳车站不用解体编组直达专用线卸车，使沈阳车辆在站停留时间，由过去的十五小时缩短到三小时。阜新开往鞍山的“循环龙车”，使鞍山卸车时间缩短一半。这是“一条龙”运输大协作的新发展。经过这一实践，使大家受到很深刻的教育，大家都以协作为光荣，视本位主义为可耻。先人后己，舍己为人的共产主义风格已成为群众自觉的行动。开始，阜新车站有的同志思想不通，说开“循环龙车”我们的站停时间长了，吃亏了。阜新车站党委号召职工们算大账不要算小账，比如给沈阳开的“循环龙车”，在阜新车站多等一个半小时，给沈阳车站减了九个小时，这样一算账，职工们就鼓起了舍己为人的冲天干劲。为了及时供应沈阳、鞍山等地需要的煤炭，阜新车站把沈阳车站的站线分布图拿来，保证“循环龙车”源源不断地开往辽南各地。阜新路矿职工的风格，受到沈阳和鞍山的热烈欢迎。
    一年多以来，阜新运输技术革命、运输组织工作革命和思想革命紧紧地结合在一起。因为根据生产力迅速发展的要求，生产关系和上层建筑必须进行不断地改革和调整，才能为生产力的不断发展开辟一条广阔的道路。几个革命紧紧交织在一起，互为条件，互相促进，汇成了一股巨大的革命洪流。这股革命洪流，使人们的精神面貌焕然一新，使铁路运输工作飞跃发展，有力地支援了国民经济持续跃进。我们将高举毛主席不断革命的思想红旗，为铁路运输更大的跃进而奋斗！
