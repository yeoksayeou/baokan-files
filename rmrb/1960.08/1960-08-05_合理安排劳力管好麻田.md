Rationally Allocate Labor to Manage Hemp Fields Well
*People's Daily* Commentator

Hemp crops are an important raw material for the textile industry and an indispensable material for the production and life of the broad masses of people. Now is the peak growing season for hemp crops. We should do everything possible to manage hemp fields well, strive to increase yield per unit area, and strive to increase total output.

The level of hemp field yield depends on whether rational close planting has been implemented, whether the plants grow tall, whether the stems are thick, and whether the hemp skin is thick. Implementing rational close planting is something that happens at the time of sowing. Promoting the rapid growth of hemp stalks is something we should be focusing on right now. As long as field management is done well, as long as there is sufficient water and fertilizer, jute and kenaf can grow two or three inches every day. Therefore, we must seize the moment and make field management work more detailed and better, so that hemp plants grow vigorously and quickly. Judging from the current growth of hemp seedlings, due to abnormal weather, the southern hemp-producing areas have suffered several cold spells and storms, and the northern hemp areas have encountered drought. Some hemp seedlings in early-sown hemp fields are not growing well, and the sowing period for some hemp fields has been delayed. Therefore, we should redouble our efforts, strengthen management, promote the healthy growth of early hemp plants, and promote late hemp to catch up with early hemp, striving for a large-scale balanced increase in production.

At present, in hemp field management, we must focus on topdressing fertilizer, combined with irrigation, weeding, and eliminating pests and diseases. Hemp crops are fertilizer-loving crops. According to experiments in some areas, one jin of ammonium sulfate fertilizer can increase hemp skin production by about five jin. Therefore, to strengthen hemp field management, we must vigorously grasp the accumulation of fertilizer, the production of fertilizer, and careful topdressing. This year, all provinces generally have special chemical fertilizers for hemp fields, which must be applied in the hemp fields. Some hemp-producing areas in the south have recently experienced drought, and irrigation should be carried out in time to prevent drought. At the same time, attention should also be paid to preventing waterlogging and drainage.

Currently, hemp field management work is not being carried out evenly in various regions. Many regions are doing very well, but individual regions have relaxed hemp field management because they are very busy with farm work. The key to doing a good job in hemp field management lies in strengthening leadership. As long as the leadership grasps tightly and meticulously, is good at rationally allocating labor, hemp field management work can be done well. Cadres at all levels of the Guali Commune in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, go deep into the front line of production, earnestly help the masses solve ideological and practical problems, consult with the masses on everything, rationally allocate labor, and adopt the method of combining the establishment of specialized teams with vigorous mass movements. Heavy fertilizer (the first application of stalk growth fertilizer) has been applied in the hemp fields, irrigation has been carried out twice, and garbage and river mud have been spread in more than 29,000 mu of hemp fields to prevent drought and conserve moisture. The jute in the whole commune is growing vigorously, and the hemp plants generally reach more than five feet tall. This practice is worth learning. It is right to attach importance to food crops. However, while strengthening the management of food crops, we must also rationally allocate labor and manage hemp fields well. Otherwise, it will not be "taking grain as the key link and making overall arrangements."

    合理安排劳力管好麻田	本报评论员
    麻类作物是纺织工业的重要原料，是广大人民生产上和生活上不可缺少的物资。当此麻类作物生长旺期，我们应该千方百计地搞好麻田管理，努力提高单位面积产量，力争增加总产量。
    麻田产量高低，决定于是否实行了合理密植，植株长得是否高大，茎秆是否粗壮，麻皮是否厚实。实行合理密植，那是播种时候的事情。促使麻类茎秆快速生长，现在正是用劲的时候。只要田间管理工作搞得好，只要水肥充足，黄麻、洋麻每天可以增长两三寸。因此，我们必须抢住火候，把麻田管理工作搞得更细更好，让麻株猛发快长。从当前麻苗生长情况来看，由于气候不正常，南方各麻区遭受了数次寒潮和暴风的侵袭，北方麻区遇到干旱，早播麻田的一些麻苗长得不好，有些麻田的播种期推迟了。因此，我们应该加倍使劲，加强管理，促使早麻植株生长齐壮，促使晚麻赶上早麻，争取大面积平衡增产。
    目前，在麻田管理上，要以追施肥料为中心，结合进行灌水、除草、消灭病虫害。麻类作物是嗜肥作物。根据一些地区试验，一斤硫铵化肥可增产麻皮五斤左右。因此，加强麻田管理，必须大抓积肥、造肥和精细追肥。今年各省一般都有麻田专用化肥，一定要施在麻田里。南方一些麻产区最近又有旱象，应该及时灌水防旱，同时也要注意防涝排水。
    当前各地麻田管理工作进行得不够平衡。许多地区作的很好，个别地区因为农活很忙，把麻田管理放松了。搞好麻田管理的关键在于加强领导。只要领导上抓得紧，抓得细，善于合理安排劳动力，麻田管理工作就能搞好。浙江萧山县瓜沥公社各级干部深入生产第一线，切切实实地帮助群众解决思想问题和实际问题，遇事跟群众商量，合理分配劳力，并采取建立专业队和大搞群众运动相结合的办法，已在麻田里追施重肥（施第一次长秆肥），两次灌水，并在二万九千多亩麻田里铺了垃圾、河泥，以便防旱保墒。全社的黄麻生长健壮，麻株普遍达到五尺多高。这种作法值得学习。重视粮食作物是对的。可是，在加强粮食作物管理的同时，也要合理安排劳力，管好麻田。否则就不是“以粮为纲，全面安排”了。
