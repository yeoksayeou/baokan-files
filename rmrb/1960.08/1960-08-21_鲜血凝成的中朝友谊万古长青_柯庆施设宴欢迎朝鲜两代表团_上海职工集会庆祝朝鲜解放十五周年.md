Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 20th: Ke Qingshi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, and Mayor of Shanghai, hosted a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the delegation of the China-Korea Friendship Association headed by Kim Jong-heng and the Korean film delegation headed by Kim Han-gyu.

Present at the banquet were Chen Pixian and Cao Diqiu, Secretaries of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee; Shi Ximin and Liu Shuzhou, Alternate Secretaries; Song Jiwen and Jin Zhonghua, Deputy Mayors of Shanghai; Hu Juewen, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC; Lieutenant General Wang Bicheng, Commander of the Shanghai Garrison District of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; as well as former Volunteer Army heroes and prominent figures from all walks of life.

Li Kuanyong, Consul General of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Shanghai, and his wife also attended the banquet.

Comrade Ke Qingshi spoke first at the banquet. He said that the Korean people, striding forward on the Chollima and galloping along the bright road of socialism, are creating earth-shattering miracles, attracting the attention of the Chinese people every day. We regard the achievements of the Korean people as our common achievements! The revolutionary heroic spirit of the Korean people has greatly encouraged the Chinese people who are in the midst of the Great Leap Forward.

Ke Qingshi pointed out that imperialism will never automatically give up aggression. The people of China and Korea have a deep understanding of this aggressive nature of US imperialism from their own personal experience. Our two governments, China and Korea, have always adhered to a foreign policy of peace. Our firm opposition to the war and aggression policies of US imperialism is precisely to most resolutely defend world peace. We will continue to stand with the Korean people, stand with other socialist countries, and unswervingly wage a resolute struggle against the US-led imperialist aggressive bloc, to safeguard and strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to make unremitting efforts to oppose modern revisionism and defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism!

Kim Jong-heng, head of the China-Korea Friendship Association delegation, spoke amid warm applause. He said that the Korean people have a flesh-and-blood relationship with the Chinese people. The Korean people will never forget the valuable assistance of the people of Shanghai and the entire Chinese people, and will do everything possible to further strengthen the friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China.

Kim Jong-heng pointed out that under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist parties, the people of Korea and China have achieved brilliant achievements and are heading towards communism with full confidence. He said that any sinister conspiracy of the US-led imperialist aggressors can never destroy our united strength.

Kim Jong-heng concluded by proposing a toast: to the unbreakable friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China, to the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to the health of the Chinese party and state leaders headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and to the victory of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.

Before the banquet, Comrade Ke Qingshi met with all members of the China-Korea Friendship Association delegation and the Korean film delegation. After the banquet, a soiree was held with wonderful artistic performances for the distinguished guests.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 20th: More than 900 workers from five factories, including Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 2, held a grand rally this afternoon to warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea and to welcome the China-Korea Friendship Association delegation headed by Kim Jong-heng and the Korean film delegation headed by Kim Han-gyu, who are visiting Shanghai.

The five factories, including State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 2 and Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory, have close friendly ties with the heroic Korean people. When the evil US imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea in 1950, the workers of State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 2 immediately threw themselves into the vigorous movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country with the practical action of donating an airplane. When Premier Kim Il-sung visited our country in 1958, he visited the Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory. Over the years, these factories have received many delegations from Korea in various fields such as workers, agriculture, culture, and arts.

At 2:30 pm, when the China-Korea Friendship Association delegation and the Korean film delegation, accompanied by Yao Li, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Higher Education, Cai Ben, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Film Bureau, and Li Kuanyong, Consul General of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Shanghai, arrived at State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 2, the workers gathered at the factory gate, beating gongs and drums to warmly welcome them. The distinguished guests then visited several workshops.

At the celebration meeting, Zhang Miaogen, Secretary of the Party Committee of State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 2, spoke first. He said that the fighting friendship forged in blood by the people of China and Korea is unbreakable, and we will fight to the end against the most vicious enemy of the people of China and Korea and the people of the world—US imperialism.

Kim Jong-heng, head of the China-Korea Friendship Association delegation, spoke amid warm applause. He praised the revolutionary spirit of the Shanghai workers and the great achievements they have made in the Great Leap Forward. He said that the fraternal friendship between Korea and China, as high as Mount Tai and as deep as the sea, cannot be destroyed by any force. He said that the people of Korea and China will surely force US imperialism to get out of South Korea and Taiwan, and achieve their respective national unification and territorial integrity. Kim Jong-heng also said that the Korean people, in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, will always advance bravely towards communism together with the Chinese people!

Chen Guanhua, a demobilized soldier of the Volunteer Army from State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 2, also spoke at the meeting.

After the meeting, the workers also performed artistic programs for the Korean guests.

The China-Korea Friendship Association delegation arrived in Shanghai by plane from Wuhan on the evening of the 19th, and was warmly welcomed at the airport by Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, and others. The Korean film delegation arrived in Shanghai on the 18th.

    柯庆施指出，帝国主义是决不会自动放弃侵略的。中朝两国人民从自己的亲身经验中，对美帝国主义的这种侵略本质有着深刻的认识。我们中朝两国政府一贯坚持和平外交政策。我们坚决反对美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，也正是为了最坚决地保卫世界和平。我们将继续同朝鲜人民站在一起，同其他社会主义国家站在一起，坚持不懈地同以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团进行坚决的斗争，为维护和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，为反对现代修正主义、保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性而进行坚持不懈的努力！
    朝中友协代表团团长金钟恒在热烈的掌声中讲话。他说，朝鲜人民同中国人民有着血肉相连的关系，朝鲜人民绝不会忘记上海市人民和全体中国人民对我们的宝贵援助，并且将尽一切力量进一步加强朝中两国人民的友谊和团结。

    宴会之前，柯庆施同志接见了朝中友协代表团和朝鲜电影代表团的全体成员。宴会之后，还举行了晚会，为贵宾们演出了精彩的文艺节目。
    据新华社上海20日电　上海国棉二厂等五个工厂的九百多个职工，今天下午举行隆重集会，热烈庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年，并欢迎前来上海访问的以金钟恒为首的朝中友协代表团和以金汉奎为首的朝鲜电影代表团。
    国棉二厂、永鑫无缝钢管厂等五个工厂，和英雄的朝鲜人民有着紧密的友谊联系。当1950年万恶的美帝国主义对朝鲜发动侵略战争的时候，国棉二厂的职工立即以捐献一架飞机的实际行动投入了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝、保家卫国运动。1958年金日成首相来我国访问的时候，曾经访问过永鑫无缝钢管厂。几年以来，这些工厂先后接待了朝鲜的工人、农业、文化艺术等各方面的许多代表团。
    下午二时半，当朝中友协代表团和朝鲜电影代表团在上海市高教局局长姚力、上海市电影局副局长蔡贲和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻上海总领事李宽镛等陪同下，来到国棉二厂的时候，工人们聚集在工厂门口，敲锣打鼓，热烈欢迎。接着，贵宾们参观了几个车间。
    在庆祝大会上，国棉二厂党委书记张妙根首先讲话。他说，中朝人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊是牢不可破的，我们将为反对中朝人民和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义，而斗争到底。
  朝中友协代表团团长金钟恒在热烈的欢迎掌声中讲话。他称赞上海工人的革命精神和在大跃进中取得的巨大成就。他说朝中两国高如泰山、深如大海的兄弟友谊，是任何力量也不能破坏的。他说，朝中两国人民必将迫使美帝国主义滚出南朝鲜和台湾，实现各自的祖国统一和领土完整。金钟恒还说，朝鲜人民在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中，永远同中国人民一道向共产主义奋勇前进！
    国棉二厂志愿军复员军人陈冠华也在会上讲了话。
    会后，工人们还为朝鲜贵宾演出了文艺节目。
    朝中友协代表团是19日晚上从武汉乘飞机到达上海的，在机场上受到中共上海市委书记处书记、上海市副市长曹荻秋等的热烈欢迎。朝鲜电影代表团是18日到达上海的。
