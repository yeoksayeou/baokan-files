    Manufacture One, Pass One, Ship One, Guarantee One
    ?Jiang Mechanical Plant Ensures Top Quality in Agricultural Machinery Production
    Main Experiences: Strengthening Ideological Education; Strict Inspection System; Sending People to the Countryside to Solicit Opinions
    (Our Dispatch) The ?Jiang County Mechanical Plant in Yunnan Province has established the idea of "Quality First" and is serving agricultural production in a down-to-earth manner. The large number of agricultural machines and transportation tools produced by this factory this year have basically achieved "three satisfactions" for workers, farmers, and merchants.
    In order to better support agriculture, this factory has strengthened the ideological education of its employees, focusing on the idea that agriculture is the foundation of national economic development. It constantly pays attention to overcoming the idea of neglecting product quality. It adopts the mass line method of "three combinations" inside and outside the factory to continuously improve product quality. It mobilizes the masses to carry out innovation and launch quality competitions to achieve "Manufacture One, Pass One, Ship One, Guarantee Use One."
    Ensuring "Quality First"
    ?Jiang County Mechanical Plant is a mechanical factory formed in 1958 by merging several handicraft cooperative production groups. Before the first half of last year, some leading cadres in the factory were not very clear about serving agriculture in a solid manner in terms of ideological understanding. During the autumn harvest of 1958, the factory rushed to produce a batch of threshing machines. This was originally a good thing like "sending an umbrella before the rain." However, due to poor quality, it added trouble to the farmers instead.
    In order to improve product quality, the ?Jiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party required the factory to establish a firm concept of serving agricultural production to the end ideologically and to achieve "Manufacture One, Pass One, Ship One, Ensure Use One." According to the instructions of the higher party committee, the factory launched a large-scale ideological education movement centered on improving quality education in the second half of last year, focusing on industrial service to agricultural production. During the movement, the masses were mobilized to speak out freely, expose problems, organize accounting, and conduct debates. In this education movement, all employees of the factory further clarified that industry must support agriculture on time, with quality and quantity.
    Fighting Against the Idea of Neglecting Quality
    Facts have proved that the concept of "Quality First" must be paid attention to at all times. Since the third quarter of last year, there have been instances of some employees not strictly demanding the quality of some products with low output value. For example, during the autumn harvest, the factory accepted a batch of threshing machine tasks. Production progressed very slowly, and there were also quality problems. After in-depth inspection, it was found that a few employees believed that "manufacturing one hundred threshing machines is not as valuable as two sluice gates," so their enthusiasm for production was not high. The factory party branch criticized this idea and educated all employees to recognize that "products, no matter how big or small, are all beneficial to agriculture." It also organized cadres to go to the countryside to visit the scene of the rice harvest in the fields, to understand the urgent desire of the vast number of farmers to use threshing machines, and to further strengthen the sense of responsibility of the employees. Subsequently, the factory's production immediately underwent great changes. Cadres at all levels went to the workshops to grasp quality and promote progress, and took measures to improve manufacturing technology. The daily output of threshing machines increased from about ten units to more than forty units.
    Improving Systems, Upholding Systems
    In ensuring product quality, the factory has continuously established and improved a series of systems to ensure that everyone checks and every check has a system. This has prompted the vast number of employees to abide by and supervise the implementation of various systems. Last year, the factory, through summarizing its work, established a set of "five nos system" based on targeted treatment, including "no construction without drawings, no material issuance without plans, no processing of unqualified castings, no shipment of unqualified products, and no mass production without trial production." In strengthening inspection, a "three-level" inspection system was formulated, with worker inspection, technical personnel and full-time cadre inspection, group inspection, and workshop and factory-level inspection.
    After establishing and improving the systems, the factory constantly paid attention to checking the implementation of various systems and fought meticulously against various "careless" attitudes. For example, at the beginning of this year, when the factory was rushing to produce a batch of irrigation and drainage machinery, the assembly workshop found that a batch of screws were of poor quality. At that time, the machine workshop believed that time was tight and asked to "be careless once." The assembly workshop resolutely implemented the "no assembly of unqualified products" system. The factory leadership also proposed that "not even one bad screw is allowed to be used." The machine workshop then reorganized its forces and rushed to produce a batch of good screws on time.
    From "Three Combinations" to "Three Satisfactions"
    The ?Jiang County Mechanical Plant's large-scale "three combinations" inside and outside the factory is also an important experience in ensuring product quality. Under the slogan of "Quality First," leading cadres at all levels of the factory go deep into workshops, sections, and groups to participate in production, lead production, and discuss with the workers. For trial production of new products and improvement of old products, professional "three combinations" groups are organized. In order to achieve "three satisfactions" for production, sales, and use units, the factory also frequently organizes employees to take products to the countryside and solicit opinions from the masses. For example, recently, when modifying the threshing machine, the factory's "three combinations" group, after research, formulated technical measures to improve the installation of the dart plate, which increased the speed and reduced the labor intensity of use. However, all employees of the factory were not satisfied with this improvement. Subsequently, the factory took advantage of the opportunity of county cadres meeting to invite cadres from Jihua Commune to the factory for trial use and appraisal. Some cadres suggested changing to high-quality wooden pedals and adding a pedal hook fixing device in order to extend the service life. Based on the spirit of responding to every request, the factory tried its best to overcome the difficulties of lack of raw materials and insufficient equipment, and continued to improve quality according to the suggestions of the masses, so as to achieve "three satisfactions" for workers, farmers, and merchants.
    Carrying Out a "High-Quality" Competition
    In order to strive to improve product quality, this year, the factory launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and widely carried out a "high-quality competition." Because the vast number of employees have established the idea of "Quality First," they often work hard and study hard, forgetting sleep and food, because of the poor quality of a part. The workers in the casting workshop Xie Lanying group, in order to solve the technical problem of casting the "steel shaft" of the car, studied hard all night and finally found a way to cast the steel shaft.
    This year, as a result of continuously grasping quality from all aspects, the factory has not only gradually improved the ideological consciousness of the vast number of employees, making support for agriculture a positive and conscious action of the masses, but also greatly promoted the continuous improvement of the production level; at the same time, it has strengthened the relationship and deep feelings between workers and farmers.

    制造一件　合格一件　出厂一件　保用一件
    ?江机械厂生产农业机具确保质量第一
    主要经验是：加强思想教育；严格验收制度；派人下乡征求意见
    本报讯　云南省?江县机械厂树立“质量第一”的思想，踏踏实实地为农业生产服务。这个工厂今年生产的大批农业机械和运输工具，基本上做到了工、农、商“三满意”。
    为了更好地支援农业，这个厂加强了对职工进行农业是国民经济发展的基础的思想教育；时刻地注意克服忽视产品质量的思想；采取厂内厂外“三结合”的群众路线的方法，不断地改进和提高产品质量；发动群众大搞革新，开展优质竞赛，做到“制造一件，合格一件，出厂一件，保证使用一件”。
    确保“质量第一”
    ?江县机械厂是1958年由几个手工业社生产小组并成的机械工厂。在去年上半年以前，厂里部分领导干部对扎扎实实地为农业服务，在思想认识上并不是很明确的。1958年秋收时，厂里赶制了一批打谷机。这本来是一件“雨前送伞”的好事情。但是，由于质量不好，反而给农民增添了麻烦。
    为了改进产品质量，中共?江县委要求该厂要在思想上树立为农业生产服务到底的牢固观念，做到“制造一件，合格一件，出厂一件，确保使用一件”。根据上级党委的指示，该厂在去年下半年，以提高质量教育为中心，开展了一次声势浩大的工业为农业生产服务的思想教育运动。在运动中发动群众大鸣大放、揭露问题、组织算账、开展辩论。在这次教育运动中，全厂职工进一步明确了工业必须按时按质按量地支援农业。
    向忽视质量思想作斗争
    事实证明，“质量第一”的观念必须时时刻刻地加以注意。去年第三季度以来，曾经出现过部分职工对一些产值低的产品质量要求不严格的现象。如秋收时，该厂接受了一批打谷机的任务。生产进展十分缓慢，质量也有问题。经过深入检查，发现有少数职工认为“制造一百台打谷机，还不如两台水闸门的产值高”，因此生产的积极性不高。工厂党支部批判了这种思想，教育全体职工认识“产品不分大小，一点一滴都对农业有利。”又组织干部下乡，参观田间的稻谷丰收景象，体会广大农民渴望使用打谷机的迫切心情，进一步加强了职工的责任感。随后，厂里的生产立即起了很大的变化，各级干部下车间抓质量促进度，采取措施改进制造技术。打谷机的日产量从十台上下增加到四十台以上。
    健全制度　坚持制度
    在确保产品质量中，该厂不断地建立和健全了一系列的制度，做到人人把关，关关有制度。促使广大职工遵守和监督各项制度的执行。去年，该厂通过总结工作，对症下药地建立了一套“没有图纸不施工、没有计划不发料、不合格的铸件不加工、不合格产品不出厂、不经试制不成批制造”的“五不制度”。在加强检验中，制订了“三级”检验制，有工人检验，也有技术人员和专职干部检验，有小组检验，又有车间和厂一级检验。
    该厂在建立和健全了制度后，又时刻注意检查各项制度的贯彻执行情况，一丝不苟地与各种“马虎”态度作斗争。例如今年初，厂里在赶制一批排灌机械时，装配车间发现了一批螺丝质量不好，当时，机工车间认为时间紧，要求“马虎一次”。装配车间坚决执行“不合格不装配”的制度。厂里领导上也提出“一颗不好的螺丝都不准用”。机工车间于是重新组织力量按时抢制出一批好螺丝。
    从“三结合”到“三满意”
    ?江县机械厂大搞厂内厂外“三结合”，也是确保产品质量的一条重要经验。在“质量第一”的口号下，工厂各级领导干部都深入到车间、工段和小组参加生产领导生产，与工人群众同劳动、同商量。凡是试制新产品和改进老产品，都组织专业性“三结合”小组。为了做到生产、销售、使用单位“三满意”，厂里还经常组织职工带着产品下乡、征求群众意见。例如最近在改制打谷机时，厂里“三结合”小组研究后，订出了改进安装弹子盘的技术措施，提高了转速，减轻了使用的劳动强度。但是，全厂职工并不满足这一点改进。随后，该厂利用全县干部开会的机会，邀请吉花公社的干部来厂试用鉴定。有的干部建议改用优良的木质踏板，增加踏板挂钩固定装置，以便延长使用寿命。该厂本着有求必应的精神，千方百计地克服原材料缺乏、设备不足的困难，按照群众建议继续改进质量，作到工、农、商“三满意”。
    开展“优质”大竞赛
    为了努力提高产品质量，今年来，该厂掀起了技术革新和技术革命运动，广泛地开展了“优质大竞赛”。由于广大职工树立了“质量第一”的思想，常常为一个零件质量不好，而废寝忘食地苦研苦钻。铸工车间谢兰英小组工人，为了解决车子“钢轴”的浇铸技术关，连夜钻研，终于找到了浇铸钢轴的办法。
    今年来，该厂连续不断地从各方面大抓质量的结果，不仅逐步提高了广大职工的思想觉悟，使支援农业成为群众的积极的自觉行动，也大大促进了生产水平的不断提高；同时，更加密切了工农之间的关系和深厚的感情。
