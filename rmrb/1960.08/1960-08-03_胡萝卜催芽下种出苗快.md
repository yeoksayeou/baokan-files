Carrot Sprouting Before Sowing Leads to Fast Emergence

Cui Juren, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Nidian Brigade of the Wuma Commune in Bo County, Anhui, has experimented with soaking and sprouting methods to promote early emergence of carrots. This method is now being promoted throughout the commune.

According to the brigade's experience, soaking and sprouting has the following benefits:

First, rapid emergence. From soaking and sprouting to emergence, it only takes three days, which is five to seven days earlier than direct sowing. Second, guaranteed full emergence. Experiments have shown that as long as the soil has moisture, sprouting before sowing ensures full emergence.

How to sprout? The method is: first soak the carrot seeds in river water for one day, then take them out and place them in a reed mat to generate heat and sprout. Generally, they are taken out and sown after one day.

The Nidian Brigade has universally adopted this method for sowing carrots this year. The more than 720 mu of carrots that have already been sown have all emerged within one day. Li Sigen

    胡萝卜催芽下种出苗快
    安徽亳县五马公社泥店大队党总支书记崔居仁，试用泡种催芽方法，促使胡萝卜提前出苗。现全公社正在推广这一办法。
    根据这个队的体会，泡种催芽有以下好处：
    一，出苗快。从泡种催芽到出苗只需三天，比直接播种能提前五至七天出苗。二，保证全苗。经过试验，催芽下种的只要地有墒即能出全苗。
    怎样催芽？方法是：先把胡萝卜种子用河水浸泡一天，捞出后放到蒲包里，使其发热抽芽，一般的一天后取出播种。
    泥店大队今年播种胡萝卜，已普遍使用了这种方法。已经播下的七百二十多亩胡萝卜，先后都是一天出齐苗。　李思根
