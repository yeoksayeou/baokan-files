Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 5th. Shanghai's steel front workers, on the basis of achieving significant results in steel production in July, have achieved new victories in August. According to statistics from relevant departments, from August 1st to 3rd, the city's steel production increased by 36.3% compared to the same period in July, and the average daily production level for the three days was 15.9% higher than the average daily production level in July. The qualified rate and first-class product rate of converter steel also increased compared to July.

Since July, it has been the high-temperature season, and the sulfur content of the pig iron used in each steel plant is higher than in the past, which has brought many difficulties to steelmaking production. In order to comprehensively advance the output and quality of steel, leading cadres at all levels of the steel plants have gone to the forefront of production to strengthen political and ideological work, and discuss with the masses of workers, and take positive measures aimed at the key to production. The converter workshops of each plant first resolutely implemented the technical route of large air volume, and promoted many new technologies and advanced experiences to extend furnace life, improve desulfurization rate, and melting rate, with the iron melting furnace as the center. Secondly, after discussions by the workers, each workshop formulated new operating regulations and unified the furnace front operations. Thirdly, from roasting, brick making, furnace construction to furnace front and all auxiliary sections, careful operation was carried out to ensure quality at every stage. Leading cadres and the masses in each workshop, combined with trial furnaces, created and summarized many new experiences, creating favorable conditions for improving the level of steel production.

The steelworkers of each steel plant worked hard and strived to achieve more; a production competition of planting red flags and establishing pacesetters was launched, which also played a great role in overcoming high temperatures and high sulfur content. Since the workers of the second and third converter workshops of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 launched a competition to produce 100 tons of steel per shift per converter, the shift output of each furnace has increased by more than 30%. The workers of the first and second converter workshops of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 launched a key task breakthrough steel production performance competition, strengthened cooperation between various links, and adopted many advanced measures, which increased the furnace age of iron melting furnaces to more than 200 heats, and the hourly iron output reached the design level. The third converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 was originally at the bottom of the city's large converter competition. Thanks to the launch of mass competition activities, the average daily steel production in the first three days of August increased by more than 50% compared to July and entered the advanced ranks of the city's converter workshops.

At the tense moment when steelworkers were fighting high temperatures and seizing high output, responsible comrades of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, the Wusong District Committee, and the Shanghai Metallurgical Bureau, as well as cadres of urban and district agencies, also frequently went to the most arduous high-temperature workshops to work alongside the workers and solve production problems together. Employees of the machinery, electrical, transportation, commercial, and material supply departments also ensured the needs of steel production in terms of manpower and materials. Many mechanical and electrical factories prioritized the task of manufacturing steel production equipment and completed the manufacture of a batch of iron melting furnaces, hot blast furnaces, and auxiliary equipment on converters ahead of schedule. Employees of the transportation department took the initiative to strengthen contact with various steel plants and material departments, dispatching vehicles and ships to ensure that raw materials such as coal, iron, and ore were delivered to the furnace front in a timely manner. The party organizations of each steel plant grasped production on the one hand and life on the other, properly arranging workers' rest, sleep, and recreational activities.

Under the care of the leadership and the support of all parties, the enthusiasm of the staff and workers of Shanghai's steel plants is getting higher and higher, and their fighting spirit is getting higher and higher. They are determined to continue to increase steel production in August.

    艰苦奋斗干劲充足生产步步高涨
    上海炼钢工人战高温夺高产
    领导干部深入第一线切实抓措施，工商各部门协力支援钢厂
    新华社上海5日电　上海钢铁战线的工人在7月份钢铁生产取得重大成果的基础上，进入8月又夺得了新的胜利。据有关部门统计，8月1日到3日，全市钢产量比7月同期增长36.3％，三天的平均日产水平比7月份的平均日产水平高15.9％；转炉钢的合格率和一级品率也比7月份提高。
    7月份以来正是高温季节，加之各钢厂所用生铁的含硫量都比以往的高，给炼钢生产带来不少困难。为了使钢的产量、质量全面跃进，各钢铁厂的各级领导干部，纷纷到生产第一线，加强政治思想工作，和工人群众共同商量，针对生产关键，采取积极措施。各厂的转炉车间首先坚决贯彻了大风量等技术路线，并且以化铁炉为中心，推广了许多延长炉子寿命、提高去硫率和熔化率的新技术和先进经验。其次，各车间经过工人讨论，制订了新的操作规程，统一了炉前操作。第三，从焙烧、制砖、砌炉到炉前以及所有辅助工段、环环认真操作，保证质量。各车间的领导干部和群众结合，通过抓试验炉，创造和总结了许多新经验，为提高钢的生产水平创造了有利条件。
    各钢铁厂的工人们发奋图强，苦干实干；开展了插红旗、树标兵的生产竞赛，对战胜高温、高硫也起了很大作用。上钢一厂第二、第三转炉车间的工人开展每座转炉班产百吨钢的竞赛以来，每座炉子的班产量提高了30％以上。上钢三厂第一、第二转炉车间的工人，开展攻关夺钢表演赛，加强了各个环节之间的协作，采用了许多先进措施，使化铁炉炉龄提高到二百炉以上，小时出铁量达到了设计水平。上钢一厂第三转炉车间，原来在全市大型转炉评比中一直居于末位，由于群众性竞赛活动的开展，8月份前三天的钢的平均日产量比7月份增长了50％以上，进入了全市转炉车间的先进行列。
    在钢铁工人战高温、夺高产的紧张关头，中共上海市委、吴淞区委、上海市冶金局的负责同志以及市区机关的干部，也经常到工作最艰苦的高温车间里和工人们一起劳动，一起解决生产中的问题。机械、电机、交通、商业和物资供应部门的职工，也在人力物力上保证钢铁生产的需要。许多机电工厂把制造钢铁生产设备的任务放在第一位，提前制造完成一批化铁炉、热风炉和转炉上的附属设备。交通部门的职工主动加强与各钢厂和物资部门联系，调度车辆、船只，保证把煤、铁、矿石等原料及时送到炉前。各钢厂党组织一面抓生产，一面抓生活，妥善地安排了工人的休息、睡眠和文娱活动。
    在领导关怀，各方面支援之下，上海各钢铁厂职工，干劲愈来愈足，斗志愈来愈高，决心在8月份使钢产量继续增长。
