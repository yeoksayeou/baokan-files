　　Novel and Colorful Announcing Styles
　　Bao Jing
　　Having watched performances for decades, I've generally seen the announcer use a spoken (recited) format. However, the announcing styles of the Xi'an Metallurgical Institute's amateur performing arts troupe can be described as a blossoming of a hundred flowers, including clapper talk, cross-talk, poetry, duets, storytelling with clappers, and even slapstick comedy. These announcing segments themselves are excellent performances.

　　This type of announcing is not only novel, varied, and lively, but it can also organically connect many of the evening’s smaller performances. For example, after a performance of folk music, two old men suddenly come onstage, striking gongs and drums in the style of a monkey show, singing: "After listening to folk music with smiles, two old men announce the next act.

　　(A) The flute playing earlier was quite good.
　　(B) I suggest he give us a flute solo.
　　(A) What would you like to hear?
　　(B) Start with 'Jasmine Flower.'"

　　When announcing the dance "The First Day in the Commune Canteen," after the previous performance ends, a person in a traditional long gown comes onstage. He strikes the castanets in his hand and begins to tell the story of Wu Song crossing Jingyang Ridge. But this comrade isn't talking about Wu Song fighting the tiger; as he speaks, Wu Song walks into the commune canteen. This imaginative flight of fancy immediately captivates the audience. At that moment, the announcer suddenly stops and says: "To know what the commune canteen is like, please watch the next performance—the dance 'The First Day in the Commune Canteen'."

　　The Xi'an Metallurgical Institute's amateur performing arts troupe often goes deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers to learn and perform, learning much from the people. They are bold in their thinking and actions, creatively diversifying the announcing styles, greatly adding to the content, color, and joyful atmosphere of the evening's performance.

    新颖多彩的报幕形式
    葆菁
    看了几十年的戏，一般都是由一个人用念白（朗诵）的形式报幕，可是西安冶金学院业余文工团的报幕形式可说是百花齐放了，有快板、有相声、有诗歌、有对唱、有快书，还有滑稽表演等。这种报幕本身就是些很好的节目。
    这种报幕不仅形式新颖、花样多、生动活泼，同时还可以把演出的许多小节目有机地联系起来。譬如在演过民间音乐之后，突然上来两个老汉，敲着玩猴戏式的锣鼓唱道：“听完民乐脸带笑，两个老汉把幕报。
    （甲）刚才的笛子吹得不错，
    （乙）我提议让他来个笛子独奏。
    （甲）您喜欢听啥？
    （乙）先来个《茉莉花》。”
    在为舞蹈《公社食堂第一天》报幕时，前一个节目完了之后，上来一个穿大褂的人，他敲起手中的鸳鸯板，说起武松过景阳岗的故事来了。可是这位同志说的不是武松打虎，说着说着武松走进公社食堂去了。这个富有浪漫主义色彩的想像可把观众一下子吸引住了。就在此刻，报幕演员突然刹住，说道：“要知公社食堂什么样，请看下一个节目——舞蹈《公社食堂第一天》”。
    西安冶金学院业余文工团由于经常深入工农兵群众学习、演出，从民间学到不少东西。他们敢想敢干，创造性地使报幕多样化，大大增添了晚会的内容、色彩和欢乐的气氛。
