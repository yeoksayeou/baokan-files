	Record of a Rescue Operation to Protect the Mine
	Ding Yi　Wang Xikun　Wei Qingxiang　Niu Yunsheng
	In the Municipal Party Committee Conference Room
	On the morning of July 5th, Zibo City was drizzling. Hundreds of Party Committee Secretaries from factories and mines across the city were gathering at the gate of the Zibo Municipal Party Committee auditorium, preparing to attend the Municipal Party Committee Enlarged Meeting. Suddenly, the secretaries and secretary-generals of the Municipal Party Committee in charge of iron and steel and mines, as well as the heads of departments such as the Mining Bureau, Transportation Bureau, Electric Power Bureau, and Machinery Bureau, hurried to the Standing Committee meeting room, apparently to discuss an urgent matter.
	Before Secretary Yu Fuquan of the Municipal Party Committee could finish conveying the emergency, a second phone call from the Heiwan Iron Mine reported the flood situation: “This morning, the water inflow into the mine pit is 447 cubic meters per hour, more than twice the mine's existing drainage capacity. The mining area located on the river滩 has been flooded and forced to shut down! The water is beginning to spread to other mining areas, and the situation is very urgent.”
	"The river滩 mining area where the flooding occurred is self-smelting ore, with an iron content of over 40%. The output is high and the grade is good. We must rescue it, otherwise, the production of pig iron will not be guaranteed," said Vice Mayor Yang Degui first. Then, Secretary Wang Liting of the Municipal Party Committee said decisively: "Without the mine, there is no iron. We must never let the flood submerge it. We must immediately pump out the water and recapture the submerged mining area. All units must contribute manpower and materials, like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each showing their own unique abilities, and resolutely protect the mine."
	A battle to protect the mine began.
	Here's how it happened
	In order to ensure steel production, Zibo City opened a new iron mine this year in Heiwan Village, in the mountainous area of central Shandong – the Heiwan Iron Mine.
	The open-pit mining area in the eastern mining zone of this iron mine is responsible for supplying a large amount of raw materials to the iron-smelting plants in Zibo City. However, this mining area is located under the riverbed of the lower reaches of the Zi River. The Zi River often experiences floods during the rainy season, with a maximum flow of 2,000 cubic meters per hour. In order to excavate the excellent ore buried beneath this river, Zibo City mobilized more than 7,000 people this spring to build two large reservoirs in the middle reaches of the Zi River, blocking the river and forcing it to change its course. Two flood-control dikes were built, and the iron mine also selected miners who could swim to form a strong emergency rescue team to patrol day and night during the rainy season. However, since the beginning of July, heavy rains have fallen continuously in the upper reaches of the Zi River, and the floodwaters have rolled down with surging waves. On the evening of the 4th, an experienced miner discovered water droplets dripping from the slope of the mine wall in the open-pit east mining area. After repeated investigation and analysis, it was determined that rainwater convection within dozens of miles around was replenishing the sand layer under the riverbed, causing the water level to rise. The water in the Zi River seeped into the mine pit through the gaps in the gravel layer and the mine tunnels. Despite the mine's all-out rescue efforts, the continuous heavy rain for several days provided even more water to the convective sand layer, and groundwater from all directions flowed into the mine pit, and the mine pit was flooded.
	Support with the best water pumps
	The Party Committee Secretary of the Shuangshan Coal Mine, who attended the Municipal Party Committee emergency meeting, made a phone call to the head of the mine's electromechanical section immediately after the meeting ended, notifying him to summon the most skilled veteran workers in the mine who had experience installing water pumps to his office for a meeting. He hung up the phone and hurried back to the mine. As soon as they met, the Party Committee Secretary preemptively said: "Comrades! The Heiwan Iron Mine has been flooded and we need to immediately support them with two complete sets of water pumps. We need the best ones, and they must be transported by truck immediately, the faster the better." Sun Zhaode, the head of the electromechanical section, thought to himself: the two 135-kilowatt water pumps installed in the inclined shaft are the best, small in size, easy to move, high in lift, and large in water output, but unfortunately, they have just been installed and are dedicated to drainage tasks. Thinking of this, he said: "Should we take the slightly inferior one from the repair shop?" "No, we'll keep the slightly inferior one for our own use. When supporting fraternal units, we must take the good ones," the Party Committee Secretary said firmly. "That's right! Steel production is the most important." Suddenly, Sun Zhaode realized it, he waved his hand, "Let's go, down the well!" In less than two hours, a complete set of pumping equipment, including water pumps, motors, faucets, elbows, and water gates, was transported out of the well without missing a single piece. And, fearing that the Heiwan Iron Mine's voltage would be incorrect and affect drainage and rescue, they also added two low-voltage motors as spare parts, loaded them onto the truck, and transported them away.
	Rush to make screws
	The drainage pipes sent by various departments were arranged in rows, but they lacked screws to connect them. The Boshan Steel Fork Cooperative accepted this very urgent task. At 12:00 noon, the Mayor of Zibo City notified them on the phone that they needed 1,500 screws, with the first batch of 500 to be completed before 12:00 midnight that day. The news of rushing to make screws instantly spread throughout the Steel Fork Cooperative. The temperature of the dozen or so red furnaces in the workshop merged with the sweltering heat, making it difficult to breathe. However, the hearts of the people, encouraged by protecting the mine, were even hotter than the indoor temperature. They concentrated the best technicians, used the best tools, and threw themselves into the battle of rushing to make screws. But difficulties arose again, the pig iron used to make screws was used up. What to do? Purchasing agent Li Yusheng got on his bicycle and rushed out, passing through three factories and mines in half an hour, but none of them had this raw material. He transferred to Jianhua Calcium Carbide Factory. When Jianhua Calcium Carbide Factory heard that it was for protecting the mine, they immediately took out the 400 kilograms of pig iron bars that had just entered the factory. The bellows beside the red furnace were whirring, the tongsman, the hammerer, and the fire puller worked closely together, "red-hot" iron never left the anvil, sparks flew everywhere, and one was made every three minutes, increasing production efficiency by one and a half times compared to usual. The first batch of 500 screws was completed ahead of schedule at 7:00 pm.
	The battle of the truck drivers
	It was already 2:30 in the middle of the night, and Lu Wuhe, a driver from the Second Motor Transport Team of the Zibo City Transportation Bureau, was sleeping soundly. At this moment, Liu Zhenyong rushed in from the on-duty dispatch room, panting, "Little Lu! Little Lu! Wake up quickly, there's an urgent task." Little Lu jumped up suddenly.
	"Little Lu, the Heiwan Iron Mine has been flooded and we have to go to rescue them now." Little Lu busily asked where to go and what to transport. "Go to the Zhangdian Materials Warehouse to pull water pump pipes and send them to the Heiwan Iron Mine for drainage." Lu Wuhe immediately checked the truck inside and out and drove off. According to routine, it would take more than two hours to reach the Zhangdian Materials Warehouse, but this time it only took a little over an hour. As they were loading the truck, it started to rain, with strong winds and lightning illuminating the earth. The water pipes were loaded, and Lu Wuhe was really anxious. Could the road be passable? What if the drainage pipes couldn't be transported? A series of questions flooded his mind. Sure enough, when the truck traveled less than three miles, it encountered a slippery slope. The truck wheels spun idly on the slippery slope, and the steering wheel was out of control. The truck shook its head and wagged its tail as it went up and slid down the slope. Next to the slope was a dangerous ditch, and there was a risk of overturning if one was not careful. Some of the comrades who came along went to find shovels to remove the mud, some went to find cinders to pave the road, and some stood in front of the truck to give the driver hand signals to guide the way. They fought the muddy slippery road for a full two hours. The east was already dawning, and Lu Wuhe began to have an ideological struggle. If he went, the road was really too difficult to travel; if he didn't go, the flood was like a fierce tiger. At this moment, he suddenly remembered what the branch secretary usually told him: to transport more ore to ensure that the blast furnace was well-fed. So he was full of energy, took a small iron shovel that Wang Yonghe had found, quickly removed the rotten mud on the slope, and turned up the subsoil, threw the shovel aside, got into the driver's seat, and stepped on the accelerator. With a few whirring sounds, the truck rushed up. When Little Lu delivered the water pipes to the construction site, it was more inspiring than spring thunder, and the entire rescue site became even more boiling.
	Liaowu Commune cuts trees to meet emergency needs
	On the afternoon of the 5th, after Vice Mayor Yang Degui arranged tasks such as processing screws, he rushed to the Heiwan Iron Mine. He was afraid that there would not be enough rubber pads for connecting the water pipes, so he went to Liaowu People's Commune to ask them to cut down a few trees and cut them into wooden pads for temporary use.
	After listening to Yang Degui's introduction to the situation of the Heiwan Iron Mine, the director of the commune immediately took carpenter Bai Daheng and Yang Degui to the Heiwan Iron Mine. After the commune cut down a few trees near the iron mine overnight and transported them to the mine, Grandpa Bai Daheng, who had been a carpenter for more than 40 years, had already cut a large batch of wooden pads in the mine's carpentry shed, supplying the urgent needs of the workers connecting the water pipes. But in the tense moment, no one thought that this gray-haired, energetic old man had not eaten dinner yet. When the comrades in the mine found out and asked him, he smiled and said: "You have to hoe the land until you get to the end of the field before you can rest for a while, let alone when you are rescuing a disaster!"
	The mine is saved
	On the evening of the 7th, it was so dark that you couldn't see anyone across from you, and the rain was getting heavier and heavier. The clothes of the people fighting in the mine pit were all soaked. A large number of flood-control materials supported by various fraternal units had been piled up around the mine pit. It can be said that there was everything that was needed. However, the water inflow in several mine pits in the river滩 had increased from more than 400 cubic meters per hour on the 5th to nearly 600 cubic meters. The two 100-kilowatt water pumps that had been installed could not withstand the rise in the water level in the pit, and the third 135-kilowatt large water pump had not yet been installed. The water level was only one meter away from the water pump and motor body. The water was about to rise quickly. Not a minute or a second could be wasted. How urgent the time was! Several secretaries and the mine director of the mine Party Committee were all here. Everyone knew that if this water pump was not installed quickly, all the mining and stripping areas of the entire Heiwan Iron Mine would be completely submerged and production would be stopped. What a great threat this was! In order to install the drainage pipe as soon as possible, the mine Party Committee decided to connect it in three ways. Under the separate leadership of the three secretaries of the Party Committee, the result was that the work efficiency was increased by more than three times, and they quickly converged and connected. A group of young men who were assigned to install the faucet worked harder than anyone else, but they couldn't install it no matter what, and everyone was anxious to death. Because a single faucet weighs six or seven hundred pounds, and one or two people can't do anything at all. Dawn was approaching, the water level continued to rise, and it was only 20 centimeters away from the water pump and motor. Even if they continued to fight, the time could not be delayed for another half an hour. People's hearts were as anxious as if they were on fire. At this time, someone didn't know who said, "It would be great if someone who could swim could go into the water to lift the faucet and align it with the water suction pipe!" "If this works, why didn't you say it earlier?" said Wang Ying, a 19-year-old young man and some others, complaining. Wang Ying was the first to jump into the more than seven-meter-deep mine pit water. Then, three more young men who could swim jumped down at the same time. They lifted the faucet with two poles in the water, and two people held the faucet and aligned it with the opening on the water inlet pipe. "Quick! Tighten the screws!" They swayed their bodies in the water, each showing their own unique abilities, tightening the screws, installing the faucet, closely cooperating, and in a while, all the water pipes were installed. The electricity was turned on, the motor whirred, and the 12-inch diameter large drainage pipe sprayed water onto the ground, which was such an inspiring scene! One minute, two minutes, ten minutes, watching the water level fall, the fierce tiger was driven back, and the mine was saved. Everyone was smiling, and the news of victory quickly spread throughout the mine. The entire Heiwan Iron Mine was boiling, and the spirit of communist collaboration was shining brightly.
	The continuous cloudy days just cleared, and the eastern sun shone on the entire mining area. The miners cleaned up the production site and immediately resumed production, determined to regain the losses taken away by the water. (Attached picture)

    抢险保矿记
    丁乙　王锡坤　魏庆翔　牛运胜
    在市委会议室里
    7月5日早晨，淄博市小雨蒙蒙。来自全市的几百名厂矿、企业党委书记，正聚集在中共淄博市委礼堂门口准备着参加市委扩大会议。忽然间，市委书记处分管钢铁、矿山的书记、秘书长以及矿务局、交通局、电力局、机械局等部门的负责人，匆匆地向常委会议室走去，显然要讨论一件紧急的工作。
    还没等市委于福泉书记把紧急情况传达完，第二次来自黑旺铁矿的电话又汇报洪水情况：“今天早晨的矿坑涌水量每小时为四百四十七立方，超过矿上现有排水能力一倍还多，位于河滩上的采矿场已涌满了水，被迫停产了！涌水已开始向其他采场蔓延，情况非常紧急。”
    “发生涌水的河滩采场是自熔性矿，含铁量40％以上，产量高品位好，我们必须抢救，否则生铁生产就没有保障。”副市长杨得贵首先发言。接着，市委王立亭书记斩钉截铁地说：“没有矿就没有铁，绝不能让洪水淹没，我们要立即把水排出，把淹没的采矿场夺回来。各单位要有人出人，有物出物，八仙过海，各显其能，坚决保矿。”
    一场为保矿而战的战斗开始了。
    事情原来是这样
    淄博市为了确保钢铁生产，今年在山峦重叠的鲁中山区黑旺村，新开辟了一处铁矿——黑旺铁矿。
    这个铁矿的东采区露天采场，担负着淄博市大量的炼铁厂原料供应。但是这个采场却位于淄河下游的河床底下。而淄河每逢雨季洪水暴发，最大流量曾到过每小时两千个立方。为了从这条河底下把蕴藏着的优良矿石挖掘出来，淄博市今春调集七千多人在淄河中游修建两座大型水库，将淄河拦腰堵住，迫使淄河改道，并修了两道防洪围堰，铁矿也在雨季选拔了会水的矿工，组成一支强大的抢险突击队，昼夜巡逻。可是，进入7月份以来，淄河上游连降大雨，洪水翻滚着浪花滔滔而下。4日傍晚，一位有经验的矿工在露天东采场矿壁斜坡上发现了水珠滴达滴达的往外淌。经过反复勘察分析，断定是周围几十里内雨水对流，河床下的沙层起了补给作用，水位上升，淄河里的水，通过砂砾层的空隙和矿脉窿洞，渗水流进了矿坑。虽经矿上的全力抢救，但几天的连阴暴雨，对流砂层里的水量补给更足，四面八方的地下水都向矿坑涌来，矿坑被淹了。
    支援最好的水泵
    参加市委紧急会议的双山煤矿党委书记，在会议刚告结束，便打了个电话给本矿的机电科长，通知召集全矿最有安装抽水泵技术的老工人一块快到他的办公室去开会。他放下电话，小跑步赶回矿上。一见面，还没等大家开口，党委书记抢先就说：“同志们！黑旺铁矿被洪水淹了，需要我们立即支援两台全套水泵，要最好的，马上用汽车运走，越快越好。”机电科长孙兆德心想：安在斜井里的两台一百三十五瓩的水泵最好，体积小，搬运轻便，扬程高，上水量大，可惜刚刚安好并担负着专门排水任务。想到这里，他说：“是否把机修场里那台差一点的拿去？”“不行，差一点的留着我们自己使用，支援兄弟单位一定要拿好的。”党委书记坚决地说。“对！钢铁生产最为重要”。顿时，孙兆德想了过来，他把手一挥，“走，下井去！”不到两个小时，水泵、马达、龙头、弯管、水门等全套抽水设备，一件不缺地从井下运出来，还唯恐黑旺铁矿电压不对路影响排水抢险，又额外增加了两台低压电动机作备件，装车运走了。
    抢制螺丝
    各部门送来的排水管子，一条条地排列着，就是缺乏螺丝把它们衔接起来。博山钢叉社接受了这项十分紧急的任务。上午十二点，淄博市市长在电话上通知他们，要一千五百个螺丝，第一批五百个，在当天夜里十二点以前完成。抢制螺丝的消息刹时传遍整个钢叉社，车间里十几只红炉的温度和酷暑汇合在一起，热的连气都喘不上来，然而被保矿所鼓舞的人们的心，比室内的温度还热。他们集中最好的技术工人，抽最好的工具，投入了抢制螺丝的战斗。但困难又发生了，制螺丝用的元铁用完了。怎么办？采购员李玉升骑上车子飞奔出去，半小时走过三家厂矿，都没有这种原料。他又调车蹬进建华电石厂。建华电石厂听说是为保矿用的，马上把刚进厂的四百公斤元铁条拿出来。红炉旁的风匣呼哒呼哒地叫着，掌钳工、打锤工、拉火手，紧密协作，“砧”子上红赶红不离铁，火花四溅，三分钟就打出一个，生产效率比往常提高一倍半。七点多钟第一批五百个螺丝提前完成了。
    汽车司机的战斗
    时间已是深夜两点半，淄博市交通局第二汽车队驾驶员逯武河正睡的很甜蜜。这时，刘振永从值班调度室气吁吁地闯进来，“小逯！小逯！快醒醒，有紧急任务。”小逯忽地爬起来。
  “小逯，黑旺铁矿发生了洪水，现在要马上去抢救。”小逯忙问到哪去，运什么。“到张店物资库去拉水泵管子，送黑旺铁矿排水用。”逯武河立即把汽车前后检查一番，就开走了。按常规，到达张店物资库，需要行驶两个多小时，但这回仅用了一个多小时。正在装车时，大雨来了，狂风四起，电光闪映着大地。水管装好了，逯武河真是急上加急，路能不能走？排水管运不去怎么办？一连串的问题涌上心头。果然，当汽车行驶不到三里地，就碰上斜坡滑道，汽车轮子在斜坡滑道上嘟嘟地打空转，方向盘也不听指挥了，汽车摇头摆尾地开上去滑下来，滑坡旁还有一条险沟，一不小心就有翻下去的危险。随来的几位同志有的去找铁锨除泥浆，有的去找煤渣来铺路，有的在汽车前头给司机打手势引路，整整与泥浆滑路搏斗了两个钟头。东方已经发亮了，逯武河开始思想斗争了，要走，路实在是难走得很；不走吧，洪水如猛虎。这时，他忽然想起了支部书记平常对他说的要多运矿石保证高炉吃饱的话。于是他浑身是劲，顺手接过王永和找来的一张小铁锨，很快把斜坡路面上的烂泥浆除掉，又把地下生土翻上来，把锨向旁边一扔，坐上驾驶室，加大油门，呜呜地叫了几声，汽车冲上去了。当小逯把水管送到工地以后，真比春雷还振奋人心，整个抢险工地更加沸腾了。
    蓼坞公社伐树救急
    5日下午，杨得贵副市长安排了加工螺丝等任务以后，便急忙赶到黑旺铁矿。他怕接水管子用的胶皮垫子不够，中途又到蓼坞人民公社，请他们伐几棵树割成木垫子代用。
    公社主任听杨得贵介绍了黑旺铁矿的情况，马上带着木工白大恒和杨得贵一块来到黑旺铁矿。当公社在铁矿附近连夜伐了几棵树运到矿上后，干了四十多年木工活的白大恒大爷，已经在矿上的木工棚里割好了一大批木垫子，供应了接水管子工人的急需。可是在紧张的时刻里，谁也没有想到这位白发苍苍、精神奕奕的老人还未吃晚饭呢？当矿上的同志发现后问他时，他笑着说：“锄地还得锄到地头才能歇一会，何况现在是在抢险呢！”
    矿保住了
    7日晚上天黑得对面看不见人，雨越下越大，战斗在矿坑上的人们衣服全湿透了。与坑内涌水搏斗已经是两昼夜了。从各个兄弟单位支援来的大批防水物资已堆满矿坑周围，可以说要啥有啥，应有尽有了。但是河滩中的几个矿坑的涌水已由5日的每小时四百多立方增加到将近六百个立方，已安装好的两台一百瓩的水泵已顶不住坑内水位增长了，第三台一百三十五瓩的大水泵还没安完。水位离水泵和电动机身只有一米高了，水很快就要涨上来，一分一秒也不能放过，时间多么紧迫啊！矿党委的几位书记、矿长都在这里。大家都知道：如不把这一台水泵赶紧安好，整个黑旺铁矿所有的采剥场都将全部淹没停产，这是多大的威胁呀！为把排水管尽速安起来，矿党委决定分三路接。在党委会的三个书记的分头带领下，结果工效提高三倍多，很快会合连通了。分工安水龙头的一帮小伙子比谁也干的猛，但怎么也安不上，个个急的要命。因为光一个龙头就重六、七百斤，一两个人根本不顶事。天快亮了，水位仍继续上涨，离水泵、电动机仅有二十厘米了，就是继续再搏斗的话，时间也不能再拖延半个小时，人们的心像火烧似地焦急。这时也不知道谁说了一句：“如果有会水的下水去把龙头抬起来对准吸水管该多好啊！”“如果这样能行为什么不早说呢？”十九岁的小伙子王英和有些人埋怨地说。王英第一个跳下了七米多深的矿坑水里去。接着，不约而同地又跳下三个会水的小伙子。他们在水里用两根杠子抬着龙头，两个人把住龙头对准进水管上的口子，“快！紧螺丝！”他们在水中晃着身子，各显神通，紧螺丝的，安龙头的，紧密配合，一会儿水管全部安装完了。电把一卡，马达呜呜地转起来，十二寸口径的大排水管哗哗地向地面喷吐水花，这是多么振奋人心的场面！一分，二分，十分钟，眼看着水位落下去了，猛虎被打退，矿保住了。人们个个喜笑颜开，胜利消息很快传遍全矿。整个黑旺铁矿沸腾了，共产主义大协作精神灼灼发光。
    连阴天刚晴，东方太阳照射着整个采矿区，矿工们收拾了生产现场，立即恢复生产，并决心把水夺走的损失再夺回来。（附图片）
