    A Theoretical Study Tutoring Session
    Liu Lanfeng, Theory Instructor, Qinglan Commune, Wuqiao County
    Since the county committee implemented the "two-five system" of leadership, I, like other comrades, have had time each week to personally go down and conduct investigations and research. This has not only enriched the content of my lectures but has also enabled me to closely integrate my lectures with current production issues and the thoughts of cadres and the masses. Each time, I use theoretical weapons to focus on solving one or two relatively important problems. After I started doing this, the effect was very good. Some comrades even said to my face: "Old Liu, your lectures now have substance in the theory and theory in the substance. We all love to listen!"
    So, how do I prepare my lectures now? Let's take the example of the commune cadres studying the lesson on "Two Worldviews and the Universality of Contradiction" in "On Contradiction" in mid-April. To prepare for this lecture, according to my own work method of "squatting" and participating in labor for three days within a week, "turning the face" for one day, and analyzing research materials, writing lecture drafts, and conducting tutoring for three days, I went to the production team I was responsible for—Dashenzhong Production Team—on Wednesday of the week before the lecture. At that time, due to the prolonged drought, it was a tense stage of fighting drought to protect wheat and seedlings. Through working with the commune members, I learned a lot about the situation, collected a lot of materials, and further clarified my views. When it came time to give the study and tutoring report on Monday, in addition to explaining the content of this lesson in relatively easy-to-understand language, I also used the relationship between putting politics in command and material incentives, and the relationship between production and life as examples, focusing on explaining the principle of the unity of opposites and the interrelationship of things. I explained that seeing only one side of things and neglecting the other, and looking at this matter in isolation from that matter, is a manifestation of the metaphysical worldview, not the dialectical materialist worldview. I gave the example of the Dashenzhong Production Team, explaining that when the cadres of this production team overcame the subjective one-sidedness in their thinking methods, rationally adjusted labor quotas, strengthened leadership over the canteen, and solved the problem of women bringing their children, the enthusiasm of the commune members immediately increased, and a new situation immediately appeared in production. After such an explanation, many comrades reflected that their minds were opened and their understanding was improved a step further, and they were determined to further improve their leadership style and working methods in the future.
    In order to help each comrade deeply understand the essence of the document and thoroughly solve ideological problems, so that learning can truly play a guiding role in production and work, we put forward two or three questions linking theory with practice after each lecture, and organize everyone to further discuss them. In the discussion, we adopt the method of great airing of views, great blooming, and great debate, and call on everyone to open their minds as much as possible and boldly expose problems. This time, we put forward these two questions: (1) Where is the fundamental difference between the dialectical materialist and metaphysical views on things? (2) Why do we say that putting politics in command and material incentives, production and life are dialectical unity? How did you understand it in the past? How do you understand it now? Because the contradictions have already been presented in the lecture, and each comrade has personal experience with the issues being discussed (mainly the second question), the speeches were very enthusiastic. Everyone did not express any different opinions regarding the dialectical materialist worldview's advocacy that the world is material and that problems should be viewed from a developing, interconnected viewpoint; however, as soon as actual problems were touched upon, differences immediately arose. Some people disagreed that production and life have an interconnected and mutually promoting relationship; others found Comrade Mao Zedong's article "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," explaining that our Party has always been concerned about the well-being of the masses, because the people are the creators of society and the decisive force for social development; not caring about the well-being of the masses means not being a true revolutionary. Many comrades used facts to demonstrate that, in order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, overcome the drought, and seize a bumper harvest, it is necessary to grasp production with one hand and life with the other; strengthen political and ideological education and implement the principle of distribution according to work, using "walking on two legs." To truly achieve this, cadres must participate in production, eat, live, labor, and discuss with commune members, and go deep down to discover and solve problems; otherwise, it is to ignore putting politics in command, and is a manifestation of not caring about the masses.
    Through debate, everyone's minds were opened, and their hearts were brightened. Not only did the comrades who already had a relatively clear understanding further improve their understanding, but also the comrades who had a one-sided view of the problem corrected their mistakes. They said: "The more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes. Everyone has opened my muddled head, and I have found the reason for the backwardness of the work in our area." According to my later understanding, the effect of this lecture and debate was very good. After the comrades in each management area returned, they universally inspected and improved the canteen work, rationally adjusted the labor quotas, and implemented small-scale contracting. This played no small role in boosting the enthusiasm of the masses and promoting the current drought resistance struggle.

    一次理论学习辅导课
    吴桥县青兰公社理论教员　刘岚烽
    自从县委实行“二五制”领导方法以后，我和其他同志一样，每个星期也有了亲自深入下去作调查研究的时间，不但使讲课的内容丰富多了，而且开始作到了密切结合当前生产中的问题和干部群众的思想来讲课，每次运用理论武器，着重解决一两个比较重要的问题。我这样作了以后，效果很好，有的同志就曾当面对我说：老刘，你现在讲课是理中有事，事中有理，我们都很爱听！
    那末，我现在是怎样准备讲课的呢？这里以我们公社干部4月中旬学习《矛盾论》中的两种宇宙观和矛盾的普遍性一课为例。为了准备这次讲课，按照我自己规定的一周之内三天“蹲点”和参加劳动，一天“转面”和三天分析研究材料、写出讲稿、进行辅导的工作方法，在这次讲课前一周的星期三，我就到了自己所包的生产队——大神冢生产队。当时由于久旱不雨，正是抗旱保麦保苗的紧张阶段。通过和社员一起劳动，我了解了不少情况，搜集了不少材料，并且进一步明确了观点。到了星期一作学习辅导报告的时候，我除了用比较通俗易懂的话阐明了这节课的内容以外，还用政治挂帅和物质鼓励的关系、生产和生活的关系为例，着重说明了事物的矛盾统一和相互联系的道理，说明了只看见事情的一面而忽略了事情的另一面，把这件事同那件事孤立起来看，就是形而上学的宇宙观的一种表现，而不是辩证唯物主义的宇宙观。我举出了大神冢生产队的例子，说明当这个生产队的干部克服了思想方法上的主观片面性，合理地调整了劳动定额，加强了对食堂的领导，解决了妇女带孩子的问题以后，社员的干劲立即高涨起来，生产立即出现了新的局面。经过这样一讲解，许多同志都反映思想开了窍，认识提高了一步，决心在今后进一步改进自己的领导作风和工作方法。
    为了帮助每个同志深入地领会文件的精神实质，透彻地解决思想问题，使学习真正发挥对生产和工作的指导作用，我们在每次讲课以后，都出上两三个理论联系实际的题目，组织大家进一步座谈讨论。在讨论中，采用大鸣大放大辩论的方法，号召大家尽量敞开思想，大胆揭露问题。这一次我们出了这样两个题目：（一）辩证唯物主义和形而上学对事物的看法的根本区别表现在哪里？（二）为什么说政治挂帅与物质鼓励、生产与生活是辩证的统一？你过去如何认识？现在又如何认识？因为在讲课中已经把矛盾摆出来了，每个同志对讨论的问题（主要是第二题）又都有着亲身的体会，所以发言非常热烈。对
  于辩证唯物主义世界观主张世界是物质的，应该用发展的相互联系的观点看问题，大家没有发表什么不同的意见；但是一接触到实际问题，立刻产生了分歧。有人不同意生产和生活有相互联系、相互促进的关系；有人就找出了毛泽东同志的《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》的文章，说明我们党向来关心群众生活，因为人民是社会的缔造者，是社会发展的决定力量；不关心群众生活，就不是真正的革命者。很多同志都用事实论证了，为了调动广大群众的积极性，战胜干旱，夺取大丰收，就必须一手抓生产，一手抓生活；既加强政治思想教育，也贯彻按劳分配的原则，用“两条腿走路”。要真正做到这一点，干部就必须参加生产，和社员同吃同住同劳动同商量，深入下去发现和解决问题；否则，就是忽视政治挂帅，就是不关心群众的表现。
    通过辩论，大家的思想开朗了，心里亮堂了。不但原来认识就比较清楚的同志进一步提高了认识，就是对问题有片面看法的同志也纠正了自己的错误，他们说：真理越辩越明，大家算把我的闷葫芦打开了，我找到了我们那里工作落后的原因。据我事后了解，这次讲课和辩论的效果是很好的，各管理区的同志回去后，都普遍检查改进了食堂工作，合理地调整了劳动定额，实行了小包工。这对于鼓舞群众的积极性，推动当前的抗旱斗争起了不小的作用。
