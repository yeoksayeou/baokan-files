	Repairing and Mending, Turning Old into New
		The All-Purpose Repair Street

	From dawn till dusk, Shanxi Road in Nanjing is always bustling with activity. On this street, less than 300 meters long, there are 52 shops specializing in or concurrently running various repair services, from mending pots and bowls, sewing clothes and socks, repairing children's toys for daily life, to repairing motors, pneumatic drills, and instruments for production. They handle over 260 repair items, basically able to repair anything that comes their way. People call this street the "All-Purpose Repair Street."
	The Blower is Running Again

	The various repair shops on Shanxi Road not only serve the people's lives but also actively serve production. Small repairs or urgent repairs are attended to immediately upon request. One evening, the motor blower of the iron smelting furnace at the Shuizuogang Foundry suddenly stopped working. This worried the workers a great deal because the smelting furnace would not be able to produce molten iron without air. At this moment, someone reminded everyone, "Hurry to the Flash Electric Appliance Repair Shop on Shanxi Road and ask the repair workers to come and help." However, when they sent someone there, the master craftsmen in the shop had already finished work and gone home to rest. They immediately rushed to Master Zhang Yongxiang's home. When Master Zhang heard that it was to support production, he immediately got out of bed, grabbed his repair tools, and rushed to the foundry. After Master Zhang's intense repairs for half an hour, the motor blower started running again, allowing the smelting furnace to continue normal production.
	Newly Opened Special Store

	Recently, the repair services on Shanxi Road have seen new improvements. Starting from number 41 on this road, nine storefronts in a row have been newly set up as a large-scale comprehensive repair store, something that has never existed in the service industry before. In this store, there are 50 repair personnel from 18 industries, all of whom are skilled experts at "repairing and restoring, magically bringing things back to life," selected from various industries. In this way, all kinds of repair services related to clothing, daily necessities, and housing in people's daily lives are gathered here, bringing greater convenience to the masses. On the first day the store opened, an old lady named Jiang went to repair a pair of broken rubber shoes, carrying a bamboo basket with a steel pot with a hole in the bottom, a pair of broken leather shoes, and a pair of broken cloth shoes. Rubber shoe repairman Wang Dazhang took all four items, including the basket, and said, "Grandma, we can repair everything here, even this broken basket." This old lady Jiang said with surprise and joy, "Only the Communist Party and the People's Government are so considerate in serving the people."

	The Pot-Repairing Expert "Li Three Years"

	Old coppersmith Li Shunyi is a member of the Cangxiang Neighborhood Committee Repair Group of the Shengzhou Road branch of the Jianye Commune in Nanjing. He has been running a repair stall in Cangxiang for 30 years. Whenever someone comes to repair a pot, he always picks up a repaired pot, and uses his wooden hammer to "clang" on the newly replaced bottom, saying, "I guarantee it for three years!" Over time, people call him "Li Three Years."

	In fact, saying it's guaranteed for three years, it's more than three years. Take the Yang Mingqing family at number 127, for example, the number two steel pot they use for cooking has had its bottom replaced for four years, but the pot is still in good condition.

	Li Shunyi is 62 years old this year, and his skills are getting better and better, truly reaching a state of "pure perfection." The pots he repairs are both good and fast. This year, at the city's Second Commercial Workers' Technical Sports Meeting, he replaced a one-inch-higher, nine-inch steel pot bottom in three minutes and fifteen and three-tenths seconds, winning the "Champion" flag for repairs.

    修修补补  变旧成新
        万能修旧街
    从清晨到黄昏，南京市山西路这一条街上，始终是熙熙攘攘，热闹异常。在这条不到三百米长的马路上，却有五十二家专营和兼营各种修旧业务的店铺，从生活上的修锅补碗、缝衣补袜、修理儿童玩具，到生产上的修理马达、风钻、仪表，共经营二百六十多个修旧项目，基本上做到了来什么修什么，群众称这条街是“万能修旧街”。	鼓风机又转动了
    山西路上的各个修旧商店，不仅为人民生活服务，同时也积极为生产服务。小修或急修随叫随到。一天晚上，水佐岗翻砂厂熔铁炉的马达鼓风机突然停止了转动。这下，可把工人们急坏了，因为熔铁炉一断了风，就熔不出铁水来。这时，有人提醒大家：“赶快到山西路闪光电器修理门市部，请修理工人前来支援。”可是，当他们派人赶到那里的时候，店内的老师傅们都已下班回家休息，他们又立即赶到张永祥老师傅的家里。张师傅一听说是支援生产，马上翻身起床，拿了修理工具，急忙赶到翻砂厂。经过张师傅紧张修理了半个小时，马达鼓风机又呼呼地转动起来了，使熔铁炉继续正常生产。	新开的特殊商店
    最近，山西路上的修旧业务又有了新的改进。从这条路上的四十一号起一顺九间门面，新设了一家过去服务行业中从来没有过的大型综合修旧商店。在这家商店里，有来自十八个行业的五十位修旧人员，他们都是从各行各业中挑选出来的“修旧翻新、妙手回春”的能手。这样一来，就把人们日常生活中，有关穿的、用的、住的各种修旧业务都汇聚在这里，为群众带来了更大的方便。商店开张的第一天，一位姓江的老太太去修理一双破胶鞋，手里提着的那只竹篮子里还带去一只通了底的钢精锅子和一双破皮鞋、一双破布鞋。胶鞋修理员王大章一手连篮子把这四样东西全接了过去，说：“老奶奶，我们这儿全都能修，连这只破篮也能修。”这位江老太太又惊又喜地说：“只有共产党和人民政府，替老百姓办事才想得这么周到。”		钱涵德　武国祥	修锅能手“李三年”
    老铜匠李顺义，是南京市建邺公社升州路分社仓巷街道委员会修补组组员。他在仓巷摆了三十年的修旧摊子。不论谁来补锅，他总是拿起个修好的锅子，用他那把木锤子把新换的锅底“当当”一敲，说：“包你三年！”久而久之，人都叫他“李三年”。
    其实说包三年，又何止三年。就说住在一百二十七号的杨明清家，煮饭的那口二号钢精锅子，换的底已经四年了，锅子可还是好好的。
    李顺义今年六十二岁，他的手艺越来越高，真是达到了“炉火纯青”的地步。他修的锅又好又快。他今年在全市第二次商业职工技术运动会上，以三分十五秒三的纪录，换好一个加高一寸的九寸钢精锅底，获得了修旧“冠军”奖旗。
