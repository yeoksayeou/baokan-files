    Develop Mountainous Resources to Make Wild Plants Serve Production and Life
    Heilongjiang Extracts Large Amounts of Wealth from the Mountains
    Wenshan County, Yunnan, Collects Over Four Million Jin of Wild Raw Materials in Half a Month, Processing Over Three Hundred Thousand Jin of Finished Products

    (Our Newspaper's report) According to the Heilongjiang Daily: A "Small Summer Harvest" movement, vigorously developing mountainous resources and extracting wealth from the mountains, is rapidly unfolding in Heilongjiang Province.

    This year, wild plants are growing very well in Heilongjiang. In order to collect all the wild plants that can be collected, rural people's communes in various places, adhering to the principle of taking grain as the key link and promoting the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, have made comprehensive arrangements under the premise of ensuring agricultural production. Many places are taking advantage of the gaps in agricultural production to survey resources and carry out wild plant collection work. The Yichun City Commercial Department worked closely with the Agricultural Department, and in June, they formed a survey team to go into the mountains for surveying. They discovered 15,000 mu of Amelanchier resources and over 30,000 mu of Gouzao and Yuanzao. Suiling County, located in the semi-mountainous area, has clarified through surveys that the county has 470,000 mu of resources such as grassland acorns and stinging nettle. While surveying resources, all parts of the province are also actively carrying out collection work. Lindian County seized the opportunity when spring plowing was basically completed and summer hoeing had not yet fully started. The Commercial Department transferred 120 cadres to go deep into the communes, management districts, and production teams, combining with agricultural production to help arrange labor. The county organized more than 4,000 elderly, weak, and disabled laborers, including women, the elderly, and students, to collect wild plants in a concentrated effort. In more than 20 days, they collected 550,000 jin of wild plants such as wolfsbane, Burnet, and Saposhnikovia divaricata, and 300,000 jin of pig bristle grass. The Durbet Mongol Autonomous County formed more than 20 specialized teams to vigorously develop medicinal materials production, and has currently produced more than 240,000 jin of various medicinal materials. According to incomplete statistics, the province has collected 14,000 tons of wild plants.

    While collecting wild plants, various regions have carried out comprehensive utilization work. Mishan County uses wild plants to make wine and feed, and has established 47 earthen distilleries, which have produced more than 40,000 jin of white wine and more than 4 million jin of pig feed. Dongning County uses wild fibers to weave more than 400 feet of canvas and processes more than 30,000 large packaging baskets. By the beginning of July, the province had produced 210,000 feet of cloth using wild miscellaneous fibers, more than 6,000 tons of paper pulp using wild miscellaneous grasses, and more than 100 tons of aromatic oils using pine needles and artemisia, powerfully supporting industrial production.

    (Our Newspaper's report) According to the Yunnan Daily: Wenshan County, Yunnan Province, is seizing the favorable opportunity of the large-scale ripening of wild plants and mobilizing the masses to carry out the "Small Summer Harvest" movement. In just half a month, the county collected a total of more than 4 million jin of various wild raw materials and processed more than 300,000 jin of finished products, including 150,000 jin of fiber, 170,000 jin of tannin extract, 17,000 jin of starch, and more than 3,000 jin of aromatic oils, and 77 jin of berberine. In addition, it also collected and processed many wild oilseeds, dried and fresh fruits, fragrant mushrooms, tree ears, and other mountain goods and medicinal materials. The communes earned a total of 729,000 yuan in cash, averaging more than 2.5 yuan per agricultural population.

    After the basic completion of planting, the people's communes of Wenshan County adopted the method of combining five aspects (cadres, technical personnel engaged in sideline occupations, herbal doctors, herders, and students) to organize more than 900 people into 155 general survey teams to go up the mountains and into the forests, relying on the broad masses to conduct a comprehensive survey of resources. They surveyed, planned areas, labor, and time simultaneously. After the survey, a total of more than 420 kinds of wild fibers, starches, oilseeds, and other chemical raw materials, dried and fresh fruits, etc., were identified, most of which have matured or are about to mature. Based on the survey results, the county organized a professional team accounting for 2.5% of the total labor force, a total of 3,141 people, and put them into the "Small Summer Harvest" movement. In addition to this, methods such as combining with agricultural production, work-study programs, herders, and canteen cooks were adopted, and more than 36,000 person-times were mobilized to carry out mass concentrated collection. In terms of processing semi-finished and finished products, professional teams are the main force. Generally, projects that require certain techniques and large quantities are handled by professional teams. For projects with simple processing procedures and equipment, mass processing is the main method, with semi-able-bodied laborers and students participating in concentrated efforts. In addition, canteens are running factories on a large scale, comprehensively utilizing steam, and processing various wild raw materials. The county has established more than 1,100 processing plants for tannin extract, aromatic oils, and starch in public canteens, and more than 2,000 cooks are combining cooking with processing wild raw materials.

    黑龙江向山野索取大量财富
    云南文山县半个月采集野生原料四百多万斤，加工出成品三十多万斤
    本报讯　据黑龙江日报消息：大力开发山区资源，向山野索取财富的“小夏收”运动正在黑龙江省迅速展开。
    黑龙江今年野生植物生长十分良好。为了把可以采集的野生植物全部采集下来，各地农村人民公社本着以粮为纲，农林牧副渔全面发展的方针，在保证农业生产的原则下，进行了全面安排，许多地方趁农业生产的空隙，进行勘察资源，开展了野生植物的采集工作。伊春市商业部门与农业部门密切协作，在6月份组成勘察队入山勘察，发现了一万五千亩都柿资源，三万多亩狗枣、元枣。半山区的绥棱县，经过勘察，查清全县有草原橡子、螫麻等资源四十七万亩。在勘察资源的同时，全省各地还积极开展了采集工作。林甸县抓住春耕生产基本结束，夏锄尚未全面开始的时机，商业部门抽调了一百二十名干部深入到公社、管理区、生产队结合农业生产，帮助安排劳动力，全县组织妇女、老年人、学生等老弱劳力四千多人突击采集野生植物，二十多天采集了狼毒、地榆、防风等野生植物五十五万斤，猪鬃草三十万斤。杜尔伯特蒙古族自治县组成了二十多个专业队大搞药材生产，目前已生产各种药材二十四万多斤。据不完全统计，全省已采集野生植物一万四千吨。
    在采集野生植物的同时，各地区开展了综合利用工作。密山县利用野生植物酿酒、做饲料，办起四十七个土酒厂，已生产白酒四万多斤，猪饲料四百多万斤。东宁县利用野生纤维织出帆布四百多尺，加工包装大筐三万多个。全省到7月上旬，利用野杂纤维生产布二十一万尺，利用野杂草生产纸浆六千多吨，利用松针、蒿子生产芳香油一百多吨，有力地支援了工业生产。
    本报讯　据云南日报消息：云南省文山县各公社抓紧野生植物大量成熟的有利时机，发动群众开展“小夏收”运动。全县在短短半个月内，共采集各种野生原料四百多万斤，并加工出成品三十多万斤，其中纤维十五万斤，栲胶十七万斤，淀粉一万七千斤，芳香油三千多斤，黄莲素七十七斤。此外，还采集加工了许多野生油料、干鲜果、香菌、木耳等山货药材。各公社共收入现金七十二万九千多元，按农业人口平均计算，每人合二元五角多。
    栽种基本结束以后，文山县各人民公社便采取五结合（干部、搞副业的技术人员、草药医生、放牧人员、学生）的办法，组织了九百多人，编成一百五十五个普查小组，上山入林，依靠广大群众，全面普查资源。边普查、边规划地区、劳力、时间。经过普查，共查出野生纤维、淀粉、油料和其他化工原料、干鲜果等四百二十多种，其中大部分已经成熟或即将成熟。根据普查结果，全县组织了占总劳动力2.5％的专业队伍，共三千一百四十一人，投入“小夏收”运动。除此以外，采取和农业生产、勤工俭学、放牧人员、食堂炊事员结合等办法，出动了三万六千多人次，进行群众性的突击采集。在加工半成品和成品方面，以专业队为主，凡是需要一定技术、数量又大的项目，一般都由专业队负责加工。对于加工过程和设备简单的项目，以群众性加工为主，由半劳动力和学生等参加突击。此外还大搞食堂办厂，综合利用蒸气，加工各种野生原料。全县在公共食堂办起了栲胶、芳香油、淀粉等加工厂一千一百多个，二千多炊事人员结合煮饭加工野生原料。
