Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 4th. Workers of all factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, focusing on further improving equipment operation rates and strengthening close cooperation between related workshops and processes, have launched a widespread mass competition movement since late July to strive to bring steel production in August to a new level.

	The workers of the three shifts of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant launched a relay race, with each shift starting work early, helping the previous shift with production, and familiarizing themselves with the production situation to prepare for their own shift. This created a new situation of three shifts working as one and maintaining consistent production around the clock. The workers of the No. 3 Steelmaking Plant launched a key technical breakthrough performance competition to increase slag discharge, organizing more than 250 people to work hard for three days. They overcame the slag discharge problem. The amount of slag discharged per furnace of steel increased from one and a half cans in the first thirteen days of July to more than two cans in mid-July, and nearly three cans in late July. The increased slag discharge reduced slag overflow and steel overflow, shortened the steelmaking time, and reduced the melting time per furnace of steel by twenty-one minutes, resulting in a 15% increase in daily output.

	Many factory and mine workers have compiled their existing equipment maintenance experiences into complete sets for promotion and use to eliminate equipment accidents and improve equipment operation rates. Open hearth furnace workers summarized the "Six Treasures True Scripture" for maintaining the furnace body: double shovels against the front wall, curved pipes blowing the furnace top, multiple back wall repairs during the refining period, water jackets blown every shift, T-shaped tapping carts, and mechanized furnace door blocking, which played an important role in maintaining the furnace body. The flotation workshop of the Sintering Plant launched a "three guarantees" movement: repair workers guaranteeing repairs, production workers guaranteeing operation, and leading cadres focusing on it once a day. This increased the equipment operation rate from 85.4% in June to 94.2% in July, thus overfulfilling the July production plan for concentrate powder. The flotation workshop of the Dong Anshan Iron Mine, due to a 4% increase in the equipment operation rate, saw a sharp increase of 16% in the July production level of concentrate powder compared to June.

	Workers of the Machinery Repair Plant, Refractory Materials Plant, and other units are determined to support major factories and mines in improving equipment operation rates with high-quality refractory materials and spare parts. Workers of the Southern Machinery Repair Plant guaranteed to support steel production with high-quality spare parts. The spare parts produced in July not only exceeded the plan by 29.4% but were also all of high quality. Workers of the Refractory Materials Plant inspected all the refractory bricks that had been produced, immediately removing any unqualified ones to avoid affecting steel production, while also trying to further improve the quality of refractory bricks.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 4th. Workers on all fronts in Henan Province, including steel, iron, coal, mining, and transportation, are boosting their efforts, concentrating superior forces, and ensuring the leap forward in steel production. Recently, the province's steel production has seen new growth.

	The output of steel, iron, and steel products in Henan Province in the first seven months of this year has greatly increased compared to the same period last year. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently made a comprehensive deployment for steel production in the province, deciding to concentrate manpower and material resources to promote further development of steel production.

	To ensure that steel production units have sufficient ore and coal, mine workers have launched a surge of drilling large holes, setting off large blasts, mining more ore, and mining good ore. The technical transformation of iron mines has also been further strengthened. At present, the province has completed the technical transformation of ten mining sites in terms of mining, stripping, and transportation. Many mines have used dozens of indigenous machines, such as indigenous ore carts, indigenous winches, and indigenous drilling machines. In the second half of July, the province's iron ore output has significantly increased, and the ore grade has also improved. In addition, geological exploration has been generally strengthened in various places. Luoyang, Xuchang, Xinxiang, and other places have newly opened a batch of new mining sites with high grades, easy mining, and convenient transportation.

	To ensure coal transportation, the transportation department is stepping up the construction of six railways: Mianchi to Jiaodi, Huangmen to Yinghao, Guanyintang to Nanshan, Luoyang to Yiluo, and Lizhen to Liuhegou; at the same time, it has strengthened the short-distance transportation force to connect short-distance transportation with railway transportation. The provincial commercial department will also supply 500,000 pieces of accumulated auto parts to the transportation department for repairing vehicles.

	Steel production enterprises are vigorously engaging in artificial beneficiation, practicing intensive processing of raw materials. After the ore from the Zhengzhou No. 3 Steel Plant was sintered, the iron content increased by 13%, creating conditions for increasing pig iron production.

	Local party committees and municipal party committees in the province have recently strengthened their leadership over steel production. The first secretaries of the Zhengzhou, Jiaozuo, Xinxiang, Anyang, and other municipal party committees have recently led large numbers of cadres to go deep into the iron mines and steel plants, eating, living, working, and consulting with the workers. Zhang Subin, the first secretary of the Xinxiang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, went deep into the Jiulishan Iron Mine, overcame transportation difficulties with the workers, and solved some key production problems, transporting the ore that had been stockpiled for several months down the mountain, and at the same time increasing the ore output in the second half of July by nearly half compared to the first half of the month.

    鞍钢万众一心提高钢铁生产水平  河南工业战线集中力量增产钢铁
    新华社鞍山4日电　鞍山钢铁公司各厂矿职工，以进一步提高设备作业率和加强有关车间、工序之间密切配合为中心，从7月下旬起广泛开展了群众竞赛运动，争取把8月份的钢铁生产提到一个新的水平。
    第一炼钢厂三班工人互相展开接力赛，每班都提前上班，一面帮助上一班生产，一面熟悉生产情况，为本班生产作好准备，使上下班之间衔接的更紧密，形成三班一条心、二十四小时生产一个样的新局面。第三炼钢厂职工，展开多放渣的攻关表演赛，组织二百五十多人大干三天，攻克了渣子关，每炉钢的放渣数量，7月头十三天为一罐半，7月中旬增加到二罐多，7月下旬接近三罐。由于放渣多，既减少了跑渣、跑钢现象，又缩短了炼钢时间，每炉钢的熔炼时间缩短了二十一分钟，日产量因此增长了15％。
    许多厂矿职工，都把已有的维护设备经验配成套，推广使用，以消灭设备事故，提高设备作业率。平炉工人总结出维护炉体“六宝真经”：双铲贴前墙、弯管吹炉顶、精炼期多次补后墙、班班吹水套、丁字形打小车、机械化堵炉门等，对维护好炉体起了重要作用。烧结总厂浮选车间开展检修工人保检修，生产工人保操作，领导干部一天一抓的“三保”运动，把设备作业率从6月份的85.4％提高到7月份的94.2％，因而超额完成了7月份精矿粉的生产计划。东鞍山铁矿浮选车间，由于设备作业率提高了4％，7月份的精矿粉生产水平比6月份猛增16％。
    机修厂、耐火材料厂以及其他单位的职工，都决心用优质耐火材料和备品配件，支援主要厂矿提高设备作业率。南部机修厂职工保证用优质备品支援钢铁增产，7月份生产的备品，不仅超过计划29.4％，而且件件都是优质。耐火材料厂职工对已经生产出来的耐火砖，都一律翻垛检查一遍，不合格的立即剔除，避免影响钢铁生产，同时想办法进一步提高耐火砖质量。
    新华社郑州4日电　河南省钢、铁、煤、矿、运各条战线的职工，鼓起更大干劲，集中优势力量，保证钢铁生产跃进。最近以来，全省钢铁产量有了新的增长。
    河南省今年前七个月的钢、铁、钢材的产量，都比去年同期有很大增加。中共河南省委最近又对全省钢铁生产作了全面部署，决定集中人力、物力促进钢铁生产进一步发展。
    为了使钢铁生产单位有足够的矿石和煤炭，矿山职工掀起了凿大眼、放大炮、多采矿、采好矿的热潮。铁矿山的技术改造也进一步加强，目前全省已经完成十个矿点的开采、剥离、运输方面的技术改造工作。许多矿山使用了土矿车、土绞车、土打眼机等几十种土机器。7月下半月，全省铁矿石产量已有显著上升，矿石品位也提高了。此外，各地还普遍加强了地质勘探工作。洛阳、许昌、新乡等地新开辟了一批品位高、易开采、便于运输的新矿点。
    交通运输部门为了保证煤炭运输，正在加紧建设渑池至焦地、黄门至英豪、观音堂至南山、洛阳至宜洛、李珍至六河沟等六条铁路；同时加强了短途运输的力量，使短途运输和铁路运输衔接起来。省商业部门也将积存的五十万件汽车零件，供给交通部门修理车辆用。
    钢铁生产企业正在大搞人造富矿，实行粗粮细作。郑州市第三钢铁厂矿石烧结以后，含铁量提高了13％，为增产生铁创造了条件。
    省内各地委、市委近来更加强了对钢铁生产的领导。郑州、焦作、新乡、安阳等市的市委第一书记，最近分别带领大批干部深入铁矿山、钢铁厂，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。中共新乡市委第一书记张苏斌深入九里山铁矿，和工人一起克服了运输上的困难，解决了一些生产关键问题，将积压了几个月的矿石运下山来，同时使7月下半月的矿石产量比上半月提高近一半。
