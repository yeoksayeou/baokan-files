    Miners Cleverly Solve Key Problems
    By our reporter Zhang Xiangbo
    In the battle to increase ore production, the employees of the Nanfen Iron Mine in Benxi, with a spirit of daring to think and act combined with scientific analysis, have successively broken through key production bottlenecks. In July, traditionally a low-production month due to heat and rain, they created a new record for total stripping and mining volume.
    The following stories illustrate the spirit of hard work and ingenuity of the employees, as well as the power of technological revolution.
          Moving the Obstacle
    From afar, the working face of the Nanfen Iron Mine resembles a truncated pyramid, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, forming a slope at a forty-five-degree angle.
    This forty-five-degree angle slope caused considerable trouble for mine extraction: each blast would pulverize the upper part, but the lower part would not be fully blasted, leaving a wall-like base that trapped tens of thousands of tons of ore, making it inaccessible to electric shovels. This problem occurred daily, requiring a forty-minute work stoppage each time for a second blast.
    The base became an obstacle blocking the mine's leap forward. The mine Party committee decided to mobilize the masses to "remove" it, holding several open discussion meetings. At the meetings, everyone expressed their opinions and debated fiercely. Some said, "A forty-five-degree angle inevitably leaves a base, as clearly stated in 'Mining Science.' The bottom of the working face is large, and a single blast of explosives is not powerful enough..." Before the words were finished, someone retorted, "This is like complaining about the well being deep while not looking at our short rope! According to this, the base problem cannot be solved at all!" "We need drive, but also must believe in science," another countered. To strengthen his persuasiveness, he took a hammer and struck the tile beside him. The thin part of the tile broke immediately. He picked it up and showed it to everyone, saying, "This is the same principle as leaving a base." At this time, a young worker shook his head disapprovingly, then picked up an iron hammer and forcefully struck the thick part of the tile. With a clang, the tile shattered completely. The meeting became lively, and several people shouted simultaneously, "That's right, we must use hardness to overcome hardness! Use the right medicine for the right ailment, that's what it means to believe in science."
    The discussion at the meeting gradually converged. It seemed that success depended on human effort. The discussion became more detailed, identifying the causes of the residual base and the methods to eliminate it. Finally, the Party committee comprehensively analyzed the various opinions and decided to experiment with powerful blasting methods to attack the base.
    The battle to eliminate the base began. The Party secretary, mine director, technicians, blasters, and teachers and students from the Northeast Institute of Technology who came to conduct technical experiments all went to the mountain to participate in the battle. The first thing everyone did was to find the reason why the explosives were not powerful enough in the past. Niu Xiangzhi, the Party branch secretary, provided information: in the past, the explosives were loose, and the amount of explosives loaded into the blasting holes was insufficient. The teachers and students from the Northeast Institute of Technology said that according to theory, appropriately increasing the density of the explosives could enhance their power, and suggested using "compressed explosives." Everyone immediately built a simple device to compress the volume of the explosives by 35%. The test blast results showed that the power had increased, but the base could not be eliminated. People continued to study and found that the blasting holes were damp, affecting the power of the explosives. A technician suggested using asphalt to make moisture-proof explosive packs, and another test showed that the power was even greater, but the base had not yet been eliminated. The old blaster, Wang Shouxiang, then proposed a multi-section loading method. In the past, explosives were loaded into the blasting holes in two sections, leaving too much space without explosives in the hole, resulting in uneven blasting force. The advantage of multi-section loading is that more explosives are loaded at the bottom of the hole, making the distribution of explosives both focused and relatively even, reducing the empty space. People thought it made sense and tried it, and the power was even greater... In this way, with everyone contributing ideas, they soon came up with eight advanced experiences, called the "Eight-in-One" blasting method.
    The "Eight-in-One" blasting method was very powerful. In the first test, twenty holes were drilled on an eighty-meter-long working face, and explosive packs were loaded according to the new regulations. The detonating fuse burned to the end at a speed of seven thousand meters per second. With an earth-shattering roar, the top and bottom of the working face were simultaneously lifted away from the parent body, and piles of gray ore fell onto the terrace. The electric shovel operators, who had been hiding to the side, jumped up, leaped into the driver's cab, and charged bravely towards the terrace. The buckets danced up and down unhindered, continuously dumping tens of thousands of tons of ore into the heavy-duty trucks. The efficiency of the electric shovels and trucks immediately increased by 25%.
            Hard Ore Submits
    The natural characteristic of the Nanfen Mine is the high hardness of the ore, making the drilling process slow. With the application of the "Eight-in-One" blasting method, the drilling process was often lagging behind the blasting process. All the drilling machines were mobilized and lined up in a row on the working face, extending their long iron beaks, aiming at the ore body, and violently striking day and night, but still could not meet the needs of the blasting process.
    Drilling operator Wang Kaisheng was determined to create a new machine that could overcome the hardness with skill. One day, on his way to work, he saw the rock drill in the hand of drilling worker Li Shengde turning very fast, drilling a foot into the hard ore in the blink of an eye. This sparked an idea in his mind: using part of the principle of the rock drill to改造 (transform/remodel) the drilling machine, so that it could both impact and rotate, would definitely speed up the drilling rate.
    Wang Kaisheng reported his idea to the Party committee. The Party committee believed that this was the key to the mine's leap forward and immediately assigned the old fitter Bao Xihai and others to work with him to trial-produce it. Applying the principle of a small rock drill to a huge drilling machine was a difficult task. After more than ten days of effort, they produced seven simple parts, giving the original impact drilling machine another skill - the ability to rotate.
    The key problem was that the impact head, which directly contacted the ore, needed to be powerful. Initially, they made one based on foreign experience, but it was too weak and could not grind the hard ore. After repeated experiments, they increased the self-weight force of the drill bit, so that it could both impact and rotate-shear the ore at the same time. The impact head was made, but after rotating for a short time, a weak popping sound came from inside the drilled hole, and the impact head emitted wisps of smoke. Touching it with his hand, it was scalding hot. The impact head was so hot that it could not work for a long time, hindering efficiency. Why was it heating up? Wang Kaisheng and his team carefully observed it for a long time but could not figure it out. They quickly ran to consult with rock drill operator Li Shengde. Based on his experience using rock drills, Li Shengde guessed that the air volume was too small to dissipate the friction heat. Upon hearing this, Wang Kaisheng suddenly realized and immediately suggested moving the air compressor from the bottom of the mountain to the top, reducing the air volume consumption in transit. The air volume became sufficient. At nine o'clock in the evening, the machine began to roar powerfully, and the hot air, carrying rock powder, gushed out along the drilled hole.
    A new type of drilling machine suitable for drilling hard ore was born, increasing drilling efficiency by two times compared to the original. This new machine was quickly promoted throughout the mine.
          Revolution in Stripping
    The miners never stopped their pace of leaping forward. After several consecutive victories, they wanted to adopt抛掷 (throwing/casting) blasting methods, without using transportation tools, to speed up the removal of overburden, so that they could open up the mining face faster and ensure continuous leaps forward in production.
    At the beginning, people were unfamiliar with this new technology and were afraid that the blast would be too large, destroying the facilities on the mountain, so they drilled several blasting holes behind the mountain and tested it twice. The results showed that it could throw thousands or even tens of thousands of cubic meters of soil and rock beyond the mining boundary line.
    With the success of the small-scale test, the workers decided to carry out a large-scale blast. The mine director led the workers in drilling blasting holes on the cliff. The blasting holes were flat tunnels, one meter square, and people had to bend over in the flat tunnels, holding rock drills to drill the rock.
    Four flat tunnels, thirty-five meters deep, were drilled. The blaster went in and pulled a wire, which connected to a remote command shed and was attached to sixty tons of explosives at the end. Everything was ready, and the leaders made a final inspection. A warning bell rang on the mountain before the blast. In the blink of an eye, all the employees of the mine hid in the distance, some climbing the high mountains next to them to overlook this grand undertaking.
    After another warning bell, the blaster turned on the power. With a loud bang, the earth suddenly shook, and smoke and dust rose into the air, hovering in the sky like a giant mushroom for a long time.
    People hiding around cheered and rushed to the blast site. It was as if there had been a violent earthquake here. The rocks and soil were thrown into the valley, measuring up to 110,000 cubic meters, most of which no longer needed to be transported by manpower, electric shovels, and trucks.
    By taking a series of measures to strengthen stripping, the entire mine was able to open up the mining face in the first ten days for the middle ten days, and open up the mining face in the middle ten days for the last ten days, ensuring a continuous leap forward in production.

    众矿工巧破关键
    本报记者　张向波
    本溪南芬铁矿的职工们在增产矿石的战斗中，以敢想敢干和科学分析相结合的精神，连破生产关键。在往年的低产月——炎热多雨的7月份，创造了有史以来剥采总量的新纪录。
    从下边记述的几个故事，就可以看出职工们实干、巧干的精神，也可以看出技术革命的威力。
          搬掉绊脚石
    老远望去，南芬铁矿的掌子面，像削去半截的金字塔，上小下大，形成四十五度角的斜坡。
    这四十五度角的斜坡给矿山开采造成很大麻烦：每次爆破，总是把上部炸得粉碎，而下部却炸不透，残留下一堵墙似的根底，圈住一两万吨矿石，使电铲可望而不可即。这个麻烦过去每天都要碰到，每次都得停产四十分钟，作第二次爆破。
    根底成了横在全矿跃进路上的绊脚石。矿党委决定动员群众“搬掉”它，一连召开了几次鸣放会。会上，大伙各抒己见，热烈争论。有人说：“有四十五度角就必然要留根底，这在‘采矿学’上讲得清清楚楚。掌子底盘大，一次火药爆破是力所不能及的……。”话音方落，有人反驳道：“这是不看自己麻绳短，光怪人家水井深！照这样说，根底问题就根本不能解决了！”“要干劲，也得信科学。”又有人反驳。为了加强说服力，他拿了把锤子，顺手击在身旁的瓦片上，瓦片薄处，应声破碎。他拾起来向大伙晃了晃说：“这和留根底是一个道理。”这时，一个青年工人不以为然地摇摇头，接着抄起铁锤，照瓦片的厚部猛力打去，只听当啷一声，瓦片全碎了。会场上顿时活跃起来，几个人同时喊道：“对，就要以硬治硬！什么症候用什么药，这才是信科学。”
    会上的议论渐趋一致。看来事在人为。意见越谈越细。残留根底的原因，消灭根底的方法，通通找出来了。最后，党委综合分析了各方面的意见，决定试验威力强大的爆破方法，向根底进攻。
    消灭根底的战斗开始了。党委书记、矿长、技术人员、爆破手，还有东北工学院前来作技术实验的师生们，都上山参加战斗。大伙首先找过去火药威力不大的原因。党支部书记牛相智提供情况：过去火药松散，爆破孔里装药量不够多。东北工学院的师生们说，按理论，适当提高火药密度，可以加强威力，建议使用“压缩火药”。大家随即造了一个简易设备，把火药体积压缩了35％。试爆结果，威力加大了，可是根底还不能消灭。人们继续研究，发现爆破孔内潮湿，药力受到影响。一位技术人员提议用沥青制造防潮药包，再一试，威力更大了，但是根底还没有消灭。老爆破工王守祥接着提出多节装药法。过去装药都是分两节装入爆破孔里，孔里没有火药的间隙太大，炸力不均衡。多节装药的好处是孔的底部多装点，使火药分布既有重点，又较均匀，减少无药的间隙。人们觉得有道理，试了试，威力更大了……这样，你献一策，我献一计，不久凑成了八项先进经验，起名为“八合一”爆破法。
    “八合一”爆破法威力强大。第一次试验，在八十米长的掌子面上，打了二十个孔，按新规程装入了药包，信管以每秒七千米的速度燃到尽头，随着震天撼地的轰隆声，掌子上下，一齐掀离母体，成堆成堆的灰色矿石，哗拉拉地落在台阶上。躲在一旁的电铲司机们跃了起来，一步跨上驾驶室，威武地冲向台阶。铲斗无阻碍地上下翻舞着，几万吨矿石接连不断地抛入载重汽车里。电铲、汽车的效率一下子提高了25％。
            硬矿石低头
    南芬矿的自然特点是矿石的硬度高，穿孔工序不容易跑得快。“八合一”爆破法一应用，穿孔工序常常被爆破工序踩着脚后跟。所有穿孔机一齐出动，在掌子沿上，一字摆开，探出长长的铁喙，对准矿体，日夜猛冲硬击，仍然不能适应爆破工序的需要。
    穿孔司机王开胜决心创造一种以巧治硬的新机器。有一天，他在上班的途中，见到凿岩工李胜德手中的风钻转得飞快，眨眼功夫，钻入硬矿一尺。这件事触动他一个念头：利用凿岩机的部分原理改造穿孔机，让它既能冲击，又能旋转，进尺一定会快。
    王开胜把自己的想法向党委作了报告。党委认为，这是全矿跃进的关键，当即指定老钳工包西海等，和他合作试制。小小风钻上的原理，用在庞大的穿孔机上，是个艰难的课题。经过十多天的努力，他们制出了七个简单的部件，使原来的冲击式穿孔机又长了一个技能——会旋转了。
    关键的问题，是直接接触矿石的冲击头要威力强大。起初参考外地经验造了一个，但力量太小，磨不动硬矿石。他们经过反复试验，加大了钻具自重力，这样才能在同一时间内，既冲击矿石，又旋转剪切矿石。冲击头制成了，但是没转多久，穿凿孔内传出了噗噗无力的声音，冲击头冒出缕缕青烟，用手触触，热得烫人。冲击头这样热，不能持久工作，提高效率。它为什么发热？王开胜他们仔细观察了半天，不解其故，连忙跑去请教风钻手李胜德。李胜德根据使用风钻的经验，推想是风量太小，吹不散磨擦热。这一说，王开胜恍然大悟，当即建议把风力压缩机由山下移到山上，减少风量中途消耗，风量变得充足了。晚上九点钟，机器开始咔咔有力地吼叫了，热气带着岩粉，沿着凿穿的孔道，呼呼地冒出来。
    适合钻硬矿石的新式穿孔机诞生了，穿孔效率比原来提高了两倍。这种新机器很快在全矿推广开来。
          剥离大革新
    矿工们永不停下自己跃进的步伐。在接连几个胜利之后，他们又想采取抛掷爆破的方法，不用运输工具，加速排除剥离物，这才能更快地开拓采矿面，保证持续跃进。
    开头，人们不熟悉这种新技术，怕爆破开大花，炸毁山上的设施，便在山后打了几个爆破孔，试验了两次。结果，能把数千以至上万立方米的土和岩石抛到采矿境界线以外。
    小规模试验成功了，职工们决定搞大爆破。矿长带着工人们，在峭壁上打爆破孔。爆破孔是一米见方的平洞，人们要在平洞里弯着腰，抱定风钻钻岩石。
    四个三十五米深的平洞打成了。爆破手钻进去拉了一条电线，电线连接着遥远的指挥棚，末梢系着六十吨炸药。一切准备就绪了，领导干部们又作了最后一次检查。山上响起了爆破前的警钟，转眼功夫，全矿的职工都躲到远处，有的爬上了旁边的高山上，俯瞰这次壮举。
    又一次警钟响过，爆破工打开了电门，随着一声巨响，大地突然震动起来，硝烟和尘埃腾空飞起，像大蘑菇一样，久久地悬在天上。
    躲在四周的人们欢呼着拥到爆破地点。这里仿佛遭到了一场剧烈的地震，岩石和土被掀到山谷里，测量一下，足有十一万立方米，其中大部分不需要人力、电铲和汽车再搬运了。
    经过采取一系列加强剥离的措施，全矿做到了上旬为中旬开拓采矿面，中旬为下旬开拓采矿面，保证了生产持续跃进。
