Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: Speech by Li Xiannian, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, at the Capital's Mass Rally Celebrating the 15th Anniversary of the Liberation of Korea.

Comrade Ambassador, Dear Comrade Head of the Delegation of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association, Comrades, Friends:

Today, we, the people of all circles in the capital, are gathering here with boundless joy to hold a grand rally celebrating the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the Korean people. On behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese Government, and the Chinese people, I extend my warmest congratulations to the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean Government, and the Korean people.

The Korean people, after a long and heroic struggle, achieved the liberation of the northern part of their motherland on August 15, 1945, with the help of the great Soviet army. The history of the Korean people over the past fifteen years is an epic of heroism worthy of praise. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people have undergone severe tests and created great achievements in the struggle for socialist revolution, socialist construction, and defending their motherland. Not long after liberation, the Korean people resisted the frantic attacks of the world's most powerful U.S. imperialism and won a brilliant victory in the anti-aggression war. After the war, they rebuilt their motherland on what was almost a pile of ruins, and, with the speed of Chollima, have made rapid progress along the socialist road, achieving great accomplishments on all fronts of the national economy.

Today, the face of northern Korea has undergone fundamental changes. The serious wounds left by the war have been healed, and the socialist economic foundation has been firmly established. In 1959, the Korean people completed the industrial output value plan of the First Five-Year Plan two and a half years ahead of schedule, with the total industrial output value increasing to 6.6 times that before liberation. Agriculture has achieved collectivization, basically completed water conservancy, and is moving towards mechanization and electrification. With the rapid growth of industry and agriculture, Korea's cultural and educational undertakings have made great progress, and the people's material and cultural lives have improved accordingly. Now, the Korean people are preparing to implement the grand Second Five-Year Plan, and an even more glorious and splendid construction picture is unfolding before the Korean people.

The most important reason for the Korean people's ability to achieve such extraordinary accomplishments in just fifteen years is that they have the leadership of a strong Marxist-Leninist party, and that the Korean Workers' Party has fully mobilized and brought into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the Korean people. Whether in the years of war or in the period of peaceful construction, the Korean people have demonstrated dauntless heroism and an indomitable fighting spirit. The currently booming Chollima Movement embodies the Korean people's strong will to strive for the prosperity and strength of their motherland. This revolutionary drive of the Korean people is a great inspiration to the Chinese people, who are constantly leaping forward in socialist construction.

For the past fifteen years, the Korean people have made unremitting efforts to peacefully unify their motherland. However, due to the obstruction and sabotage of U.S. imperialism, Korea is still in a state of north-south division. Under the dark rule of U.S. imperialism and the puppet regime, South Korean industry has collapsed, the countryside has gone bankrupt, and the people's lives are extremely impoverished. This situation stands in stark contrast to the thriving North Korea. The achievements of socialist construction in North Korea have powerfully attracted the people in the southern half. The evil activities of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have profoundly educated the South Korean people from the opposite side, making them increasingly aware that only by driving out the American invading troops, overthrowing the traitorous puppet regime, and achieving the peaceful reunification of the motherland can they liberate themselves from the depths of misery. The heroic struggle launched by the South Korean people in April this year to overthrow the traitorous Syngman Rhee was a total eruption of years of accumulated resentment against U.S. imperialism's colonial rule. The patriotic struggle of the South Korean people has achieved initial victories and is continuing to develop and expand. We believe that no matter what conspiracies and tricks U.S. imperialism plays, it cannot save itself from its inevitable failure in South Korea and will one day be driven out by the angry iron fists of the Korean people. The Korean people's just cause of unifying their motherland will surely triumph.

Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean people have consistently adhered to the spirit of internationalism and made continuous efforts to safeguard solidarity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and oppose modern revisionism represented by Tito. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, standing at the eastern outpost of the socialist camp, has made significant contributions to opposing the U.S.-led imperialist policy of war and aggression and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. The victory of the Korean people's war of resistance against aggression not only defended Korea's independence and ensured the security of the socialist camp, but also severely struck at the aggressive arrogance of U.S. imperialism and disrupted its war plans. The Korean people, through their heroic resistance, exposed the paper-tiger nature of U.S. imperialism, which looks strong but is actually weak, proving that as long as the oppressed people resolutely rise up in struggle, U.S. imperialism's war and aggression activities can be defeated. This has played an inestimable role in inspiring the people of the world to oppose imperialist aggression, strive for and safeguard world peace, national independence, and democratic freedoms. The Korean people’s contribution to the cause of world peace and human progress has won widespread praise and respect from peace-loving people and countries. The Chinese people are proud to have the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a neighbor and express their lofty brotherly respect to the heroic Korean people.

The people of China and Korea share a traditional and profound friendship, which has been consolidated and developed in the long-term struggle against common enemies and has undergone severe tests of sharing life and death, and going through thick and thin together. China's successive revolutionary movements have received support from the Korean people. Korean communists, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, once organized the Anti-Japanese United Army with us to jointly oppose the aggression of Japanese imperialism. After achieving liberation, our two countries have formed a relationship of interdependence. The Korean people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression safeguarded China's security and powerfully supported our people's peaceful construction. In this great and just war, the most outstanding sons and daughters of our two peoples fought shoulder to shoulder, their blood flowing together. This is a concentrated expression of the lofty proletarian internationalist spirit of our two peoples. The fighting friendship forged by the blood of our two peoples has greatly promoted the all-round development of friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries. The Chinese people will never forget the support given to us by the Korean people. The Chinese people will always be closely united with the Korean people, supporting each other, helping each other, and learning from each other, to make the greatest contributions to strengthening the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and developing our common cause.

Both China and Korea are peace-loving countries. After jointly repelling U.S. imperialist aggression, our two countries actively promoted the Korean Armistice Agreement and have made unremitting efforts to maintain this agreement. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly put forward reasonable proposals for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Responding to the initiative of the Korean government, the Chinese People's Volunteers voluntarily withdrew completely from Korea in 1958. All these facts fully demonstrate the sincerity for peace of China and Korea. However, U.S. imperialism has not made any corresponding gestures. U.S. imperialism has not only consistently violated the national aspirations of the Korean people, deliberately obstructing and sabotaging the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, but also constantly creating tensions, attempting to occupy South Korea for a long time as a base for carrying out wars of aggression. Not only have the American invading troops stubbornly refused to leave South Korea, but they have also increased their forces in South Korea, illegally shipped in large quantities of new weapons and atomic weapons, and continuously conducted large-scale atomic warfare exercises and so-called "imaginary war" exercises near the armistice line. The activities of the United States in South Korea to step up military expansion and war preparations and carry out military provocations cannot but arouse the serious attention of the Chinese and Korean people. The people of China and Korea have long experience in anti-imperialist struggle and will not relax their vigilance against any adventurous attempts by the bellicose U.S. imperialism to prepare for a new war. We will always stand with all the countries of the socialist camp and with all peace-loving people and countries in the world, and fight to the end against U.S. imperialist aggression and to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

The provocative activities of the United States in South Korea are an integral part of its overall war and aggression activities. Since the U-2 plane invaded Soviet airspace, a series of actions by U.S. imperialism to intensify international tensions and threaten world peace have shown that U.S. imperialism has not only not changed its policy of war and aggression in the slightest, but is also stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations and actively plotting new adventures. U.S. imperialism openly clamors for the subversion of socialist countries and is intensifying its suppression and sabotage of the national democratic movements of Asia, Africa, Latin America, especially Cuba and the Congo. In order to cover up its new aggression and expansion activities and divert the attention of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism is once again employing its consistent trick of "the thief crying 'stop thief'," rehashing its old tune of slandering and discrediting the Chinese people, saying that China is "bellicose" and China is an "aggressor," and so on. However, lies cannot cover up the facts. These shameless slanders by U.S. imperialism, apart from further exposing its robber-like face, cannot damage the great and peace-loving Chinese people in the slightest.

Everyone knows that the world's biggest aggressor, U.S. imperialism, long ago slapped the first "aggression" label on the Chinese people, and the just action of the Chinese people in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is the first "crime" that U.S. imperialism uses to prove China's "aggression." But the truth of the matter cannot be distorted by anyone. U.S. imperialism itself does not deny that its launch of the war of aggression against Korea was aimed at our country, and the United States occupied our territory of Taiwan the day after it launched the war of aggression against Korea. In order to defend the security of our motherland, our people had no choice but to send volunteers to fight alongside the Korean people against the American aggressors. This action by the Chinese people is entirely just and has played an undeniable and significant role in striking at U.S. aggression and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. What the Chinese people firmly oppose is the U.S. imperialist policy of war and aggression, and by no means the American people. To the American people, we have always been, are now, and will always be friendly. Despite the fact that U.S. imperialism has done everything possible to antagonize and bully our country and occupies our territory of Taiwan, the Chinese government has still taken the initiative in proposing to sit down with the U.S. government for negotiations and resolve international disputes between China and the United States through peaceful consultation rather than resorting to force. The negotiations between representatives of the Chinese and American governments have been going on for more than five years, but it is only because the American government insists on its ambition to interfere in China's internal affairs and permanently occupy Taiwan that these negotiations have so far failed to reach an agreement. The Chinese government and the Chinese people not only consistently advocate peaceful coexistence with all friendly countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but have also repeatedly proposed that countries in Asia and the Pacific Rim, including the United States, sign a treaty of mutual non-aggression and peace, making this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Recently, our Premier Zhou Enlai once again reiterated this proposal, which has been welcomed and supported by many peace-loving countries and peoples. However, the U.S. government has rudely rejected this peace proposal. In the face of these ironclad facts, is it not clear who is the aggressor and who is the victim of aggression; who wants war and who wants peace?

The Chinese people's position of opposing imperialist aggression and safeguarding world peace is unwavering. The Chinese people have always supported the just struggle of all countries' peoples for national independence, for democratic freedom, and for socialism, and believe that the more these struggles develop, the more guaranteed world peace will be. We are pleased to see that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong, the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging, and the strength of the people's struggle in Western countries and the strength of all peace-loving forces in the world have also developed rapidly. A storm of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys is rising and expanding all over the world. We believe that as long as all peace-loving forces in the world further unite and persevere in the struggle, the U.S.-led imperialist policy of war and aggression will surely continue to be defeated, and the cause of striving for world peace and human progress will surely achieve greater victories. Let the people of China and Korea join hands more closely and advance victoriously towards our common goal!

Long live the heroic Korean people!
Long live the fighting friendship forged by the blood of the people of China and Korea!
Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live world peace!

    中朝两国人民紧密地携起手来
    朝着我们共同的目标胜利前进
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念在首都各界大会上的讲话
    新华社14日讯　中共中央政治局委员、中华人民共和国国务院副总理李先念在首都各界庆祝朝鲜解放十五周年大会上的讲话亲爱的大使同志，亲爱的朝中友协代表团团长同志，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们首都各界人民怀着无限喜悦的心情，在这里举行盛大集会，庆祝朝鲜人民解放十五周年。我仅代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民向朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民表示最热烈的祝贺。
    朝鲜人民经过长期的英勇的斗争，于1945年8月15日，在伟大苏联军队的帮助下，实现了祖国北部的解放。十五年来，朝鲜人民的历史是一部可歌可颂的英雄的历史。朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的领导下，在社会主义革命、社会主义建设和保卫自己祖国的斗争中经受了严重的考验，创造了伟大的业绩。朝鲜人民获得解放不久，就抗击了世界上最强大的美帝国主义的疯狂进攻，赢得了反侵略战争的辉煌胜利。战后，他们又在几乎是一片废墟之上重建了自己的祖国，并且以千里马的速度沿着社会主义的大道突飞猛进，在国民经济的各个战线上都取得了伟大的成就。
    今天朝鲜北部的面貌已经发生了根本的变化。战争遗留下来的严重创伤已经消除，社会主义的经济基础已经巩固地建立起来。1959年，朝鲜人民提前两年半完成了第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划，工业总产值增长到解放前的六点六倍。农业实现了合作化，基本上完成了水利化，正在向机械化、电气化的方向迈进。随着工农业的飞快增长，朝鲜的文化教育事业有了巨大的发展，人民的物质和文化生活也有了相应的改善。现在，朝鲜人民正在为执行规模宏伟的第二个五年计划作好准备，一幅更加光辉灿烂的建设图景正展现在朝鲜人民的面前。
    朝鲜人民在短短的十五年中，能够取得这样不寻常的成就，最重要的是由于他们有一个坚强的马克思列宁主义政党的领导，是由于朝鲜劳动党充分动员和发挥了朝鲜人民的积极性和创造性。不论是在战争年代或者在和平建设时期，朝鲜人民都表现出大无畏的英雄气概和百折不挠的战斗精神。目前正在蓬勃发展的千里马运动，集中地体现了朝鲜人民争取祖国繁荣富强的坚强意志。朝鲜人民的这种革命干劲，对于在社会主义建设中不断跃进的中国人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。
    十五年来，朝鲜人民为和平统一自己的祖国，进行了不懈的努力。但是，由于美帝国主义的阻挠和破坏，朝鲜至今仍处于南北分裂的状态。在美帝国主义和傀儡政权的黑暗统治下，南朝鲜工业倒闭，农村破产，人民生活极端贫困。这种情况同欣欣向荣的朝鲜北部形成了鲜明的对照。朝鲜北部社会主义建设的成就有力地吸引了南半部人民。而美帝国主义及其走狗的罪恶活动，则从反面深刻地教育了南朝鲜人民，使他们越来越清楚地认识到，只有赶走美国侵略军队，打倒卖国傀儡政权，实现祖国的和平统一，才能使自己从水深火热的灾难中解放出来。今年4月间南朝鲜人民所掀起的打倒卖国贼李承晚的英勇斗争，是南朝鲜人民对于美帝国主义殖民统治多年积愤的总爆发。南朝鲜人民的爱国斗争已经获得初步的胜利，并且正在继续发展和扩大。我们相信，美帝国主义不管玩弄什么阴谋诡计，都无法挽救它在南朝鲜必然失败的命运，总有一天要被朝鲜人民愤怒的铁拳赶出去。朝鲜人民统一自己祖国的正义事业一定要胜利。
    朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，一贯坚持国际主义精神，为维护以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，反对以铁托为代表的现代修正主义，进行了不断的努力。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国又处在社会主义阵营的东方前哨，对于反对以美国为首的帝国主义的战争政策、侵略政策、维护亚洲和世界的和平作出了重大的贡献。朝鲜人民卫国战争的胜利，不但保卫了朝鲜的独立，保障了社会主义阵营的安全，而且严重地打击了美帝国主义的侵略气焰，打乱了它的战争计划。朝鲜人民用自己的英勇抗战，揭穿了美帝国主义外强中干的纸老虎的本质，证明只要被压迫的人民坚决起来斗争，美帝国主义的战争和侵略活动，是可以被击败的。这一点，对于鼓舞全世界人民反对帝国主义侵略、争取和维护世界和平以及民族独立和民主自由的斗争，起了不可估量的作用。朝鲜人民对于世界和平和人类进步事业所作的贡献，博得了爱好和平的人民和国家的广泛赞扬和敬佩。中国人民为有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国这样的邻邦而感到骄傲，并且向英雄的朝鲜人民表示崇高的兄弟般的敬意。
    中朝两国人民有着传统的深厚友谊，这种友谊是在长期反对共同敌人的斗争中巩固和发展起来的，是经受过同生死、共患难的严重考验的。中国历次的革命运动，都得到朝鲜人民的支援，以金日成同志为首的朝鲜共产主义者曾经和我们一道组织了抗日联军，共同反对过日本帝国主义的侵略。我们两国在各自取得解放以后更结成了唇齿相依的关系。朝鲜人民反对美国侵略的卫国战争，保障了我国的安全，有力地支援了我国人民的和平建设。在这场伟大的正义的战争中，我们两国人民最优秀的儿女，并肩作战，他们的鲜血流在一起，这是我们两国人民崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神的集中表现。我们两国人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊，大大促进了我们两国友好合作关系的全面发展。中国人民永远不会忘记朝鲜人民给予我们的支持。中国人民将永远同朝鲜人民紧密地团结在一起，互相支援，互相帮助，互相学习，为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和发展我们的共同事业作出最大的贡献。
    中国和朝鲜都是爱好和平的国家。在共同击退了美帝国主义的侵略以后，我们两国积极促成了朝鲜停战协定，并且为维护这个协定进行了不懈的努力。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾经多次提出和平解决朝鲜问题的合理建议。中国人民志愿军响应朝鲜政府的倡议，在1958年主动地全部撤出朝鲜。所有这些事实都充分证明了中朝两国的和平诚意。但是，美帝国主义却没有做出任何相应的表示。美帝国主义不仅一贯违背朝鲜人民的民族愿望，蓄意阻挠和破坏朝鲜问题的和平解决，并且不断制造紧张局势，企图长期霸占南朝鲜，作为它进行侵略战争的基地。美国侵略军队不但一直赖在南朝鲜不走，反而向南朝鲜增加兵力，非法运进了大量新式武器和原子武器，并且不断在停战线附近举行大规模的原子作战演习和所谓“假想战争”演习。美国在南朝鲜加紧扩军备战和进行军事挑衅的活动，不能不引起中朝两国人民的严重注意。中朝两国人民有着长期的反帝斗争的经验，对于好战成性的美帝国主义准备新战争的任何冒险尝试，都不会放松警惕。我们将始终同社会主义阵营各国一道，同全世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家一道，为反对美帝国主义的侵略，保卫亚洲和世界和平而斗争到底。
    美国在南朝鲜的挑衅活动，是它整个战争和侵略活动的一个组成部分。自从Ｕ—2飞机侵犯苏联领空以来，美帝国主义一系列加剧国际紧张局势、威胁世界和平的行动，说明美帝国主义不仅没有丝毫改变它的战争政策、侵略政策，而且正在变本加厉地进行扩军备战和积极地策划新的冒险。美帝国主义公开叫嚣要颠覆社会主义国家，并且加紧镇压和破坏亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、特别是古巴和刚果人民的民族民主运动。美帝国主义为了掩盖它新的侵略和扩张活动，转移全世界人民的视线，又在施展它一贯的“贼喊捉贼”的伎俩，重弹它诬蔑和中伤中国人民老调，说什么中国“好战”，中国是“侵略者”等等。但是，谎言掩盖不了事实。美帝国主义这些无耻的谰言，除了更加暴露它的强盗面目外，丝毫也损害不了伟大的爱好和平的中国人民。
    谁都知道，世界上最大的侵略者美帝国主义早就给中国人民扣上了第一顶“侵略”的帽子，中国人民抗美援朝的正义行动就是美帝国主义用来证明中国“侵略”的第一个“罪状”。但是事实的真象任何人也歪曲不了的。美帝国主义自己也不否认它发动侵朝战争的锋芒是指向我国，而且美国在发动侵朝战争的第二天就占领了我国的领土台湾。我国人民为了保卫祖国的安全，不得不派出志愿军同朝鲜人民一起抗击美国侵略者。中国人民的这种行动是完全正义的，对于打击美国的侵略、保障亚洲和世界的和平，起了不可抹煞的重大作用。中国人民所坚决反对的是美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，而决不是美国人民。对于美国人民，我们过去、现在和将来都永远是友好的。尽管美帝国主义百般地敌视和欺负我国，霸占着我国的领土台湾，但是，中国政府仍然主动倡议同美国政府坐下来谈判，用和平协商的方法解决中美之间的国际争端而不诉诸武力。中美两国政府代表的谈判已经进行了五年多，只是由于美国政府坚持它干涉中国内政和永远霸占台湾的野心，才使这个谈判至今未能达成协议。中国政府和中国人民不仅一贯主张根据和平共处五项原则同一切友好国家和睦相处，而且多次倡议亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内，签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，使这个地区成为无核武器地区。最近，我国周恩来总理又再一次重申了这个倡议，得到了许多爱好和平的国家和人民的欢迎和支持。但是，美国政府却粗暴地拒绝了这个和平倡议。在这些铁的事实面前，究竟谁是侵略者，谁是被侵略者；谁要战争，谁要和平，难道还不明白吗？
    中国人民反对帝国主义侵略和维护世界和平的立场是坚定不移的。中国人民一贯支持各国人民争取民族独立、争取民主自由和社会主义的正义斗争，认为这些斗争愈发展，世界和平就愈有保障。我们高兴地看到，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营空前强大，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动日益高涨，西方国家人民斗争的力量和全世界爱好和平的力量也有了迅速的发展，一个反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴正在世界各地兴起和扩大。我们相信，只要全世界一切爱好和平的力量进一步团结起来，坚持不懈地进行斗争，以美国为首的帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，就一定会继续被击败，争取世界和平和人类进步的事业就一定会取得更大的胜利。让我们中朝两国人民更紧密地携起手来，朝着我们共同的目标胜利前进！
    英雄的朝鲜人民万岁！
    中朝两国人民鲜血凝成的战斗友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
