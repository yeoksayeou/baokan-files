Mao Zedong's image is like a magnificent high mountain, from which springs flow in all directions. People who used to have no water to drink in the Gobi Desert are now as white and plump as swans. Chairman Mao's wisdom is like a vast sea, and seeing you has broadened my mind. Shaking hands with you has filled me with strength. Chairman Mao, you have brought us happiness, you have turned barren land into gardens. Without the leadership of the Party, where would we find today's happy paradise? You are the guide for the poor people, we will always follow you. You have freed us from poverty and made us masters of the era. Men, women, old and young, bloom towards you like fragrant flowers. We never imagined such a happy life as today for eight generations. We wield hoes and adzes on the fields, we graze cattle and sheep on the grasslands. Under the leadership of the Party, we sing loudly!

    高山大海毛主席像一座雄伟的高山，高山上泉水流向四方，过去戈壁滩上没有水喝的人，今天像天鹅一样又白又胖。毛主席的智慧像大海一样，我见了您思想也豁然开朗，跟您握手的时候，更使我浑身增添了力量。毛主席您把幸福带给了我们，您把荒地变成花园，没有党的领导，哪会有今天幸福的乐园。您是穷苦人民的带路人，我们永远跟着您走，您使我们摆脱了贫困成为时代的主人，男女老少像香花一样朝着您开放。像今天这样幸福的生活，我们八辈子没想到，田头上舞动砍土镘，在草原上放牧牛羊，在党的领导下我们放声歌唱！
