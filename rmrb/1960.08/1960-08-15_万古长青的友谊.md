    Everlasting Friendship
    Ba Jin
    When I read articles about Korea, I think of the days I spent in that country. A sentence I wrote eight years ago still strongly touches my heart. I did indeed write it with a trembling hand: "I feel a kind of love that cannot be expressed in words for this heroic city, beautiful land, and brave, warm people." I am referring to: Pyongyang, a city that the U.S. imperialists could not destroy with more than 420,000 bombs; I am referring to the democratic Korea where flowers still bloomed everywhere amidst the suffering of blood and fire; I am referring to the Korean people who shared our hardships and treated us even better than their own relatives.

    I often regard my days in Korea as one of the happiest periods of my life. During that time, I felt deep love and intense hatred every moment, and I also deeply experienced the friendship of being as close as flesh and blood, and understood more specifically the glory of "one person suffering, ten thousand people enjoying happiness." The American invading army used modern weapons to slaughter innocent Korean women and spill the blood of innocent children, but they never destroyed an inch of Korean soil. In Korea, I saw houses burning, rubble piles still smoking, children crying beside their mother's corpses, and old people staring blankly at the ruins. But I also saw people burying the dead, wiping away their tears, and continuing to move forward more strongly, or building simple houses next to the rubble to continue working; women filling bomb craters and burying seeds in the soil, or carrying children on their backs and digging earth to repair roads on the highways. Enemy planes were still circling in the sky, but in underground factories, young women were using unparalleled labor enthusiasm to produce wealth for the country, and in underground theaters, talented actors were using brilliant heroic images to inspire people's fighting spirit... There is no need for me to write down all the many people and things I saw in Korea here. Thousands upon thousands of people who have been to Korea have deeper feelings than I do. No one does not hate the murderous American imperialist aggressors! No one does not love the hardworking, brave, and warm Korean people!

    In damp tunnels, on mountains covered with lush trees, and in mountain valleys with flowers and water, I often heard young volunteer soldiers express their aspirations: in order to recapture the happiness of the Korean "Amani" (mother), they were willing to dedicate their personal lives. In the heart of every volunteer soldier, the happiness of the Korean people and the happiness of the people of the motherland were so closely linked. I myself had such feelings. How many Korean Amani's roofs sheltered me from the rain and snow, protecting me from wind and frost. In the cold nights, old ladies, like mothers, picked up dead branches and gathered dry grass to light the heated kang bed for me, bringing me unparalleled warmth. In those difficult days, the old Korean uncles and aunts shared so many precious things with us. Even a bowl of plain water, a kind greeting contained deep friendship. Shaking hands with Amani felt like shaking hands with my own mother; I took Korean children to see the performances of the volunteer army's cultural troupe, as if I were walking with my own children. In the small courtyards of farmhouses, volunteer soldiers helped Amani dig wells and pound rice, chatting and laughing while working. I felt like I was in a happy big family among them. In this kind of life, I increasingly felt a heart-to-heart friendship constantly growing. The more I loved the Korean people, the more I hated American imperialism. I still remember what a volunteer soldier said: "American imperialism is so domineering, not letting the Korean people live! I want to desperately strike at the enemy and avenge them." The Korean people's deep blood feud burned in the hearts of the Chinese people like fire. We regarded the suffering of the Korean people as our own suffering, and we also regarded the victory of the Korean people as our own victory. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fought side by side, finally defeating the American invading army and giving the Korean people revenge, recapturing the happy lives of Korean mothers and children, and also guaranteeing China's socialist construction cause. The blood of the heroes and martyrs of China and Korea is condensed together, cultivating this tree of everlasting friendship, making it bloom with infinitely beautiful flowers. Our friendship is not expressed in words, we express our friendship with actions. I would like to mention a few well-known names: Luo Shengjiao, Lü Yujiu, Park Jae-geun, the mother of Kim Young-soo... Volunteer soldiers gave their lives for the Korean people, and the Korean people used their own lives to exchange for the health and freedom of the volunteer soldiers. For the common ideals and common goals, for the happiness of the people and the cause of human liberation, everyone is willing to dedicate everything they have. Volunteer soldiers regarded death as home and regarded suffering as the greatest glory; People's Army soldiers fought bravely against the enemy, demonstrating unparalleled heroism; the Korean people stubbornly and optimistically defended their posts, bravely overcame difficulties, supported the war, and achieved victory. In the common struggle, the friendship between our two peoples became deeper, more solid, and stronger. I often heard people in Korea say: "China and Korea are as close as one family." This is what everyone thinks in their hearts. In fact, our two peoples are not only as close as one family, we are closer than a family! This is an inspiring friendship! A friendship that encourages us to move forward together!

    Today's Korea is no longer the Korea I saw seven or eight years ago. Korea, galloping on the Chollima horse, is creating earth-shattering miracles, and will surely complete the glorious cause of peaceful reunification of the whole country. I can imagine the Korean people's high morale, soaring drive, and joyful mood. But I still often think of that past life. I call it happiness because I myself was educated in a very clear love and hate every day. In the most acute place of struggle, in the most intense time of struggle, it is completely impossible to hesitate or stand by. People must use actions to express their thoughts and feelings. To love the Korean people is to do everything possible for them, to love the motherland is to dedicate everything to defend the motherland, to hate American imperialism is to use all our strength to strike at the American invading army. Countless touching heroic deeds generated by this love and hate are exciting and motivating people to move forward every day. This kind of environment, this kind of atmosphere, can be said to be a refining furnace. Many people have been tempered in this furnace, but it is a pity that I stayed in Korea for too short a time.

    The Sino-Korean friendship developed in the battle tightly unites the people of our two countries, hand in hand and heart to heart, to move forward, not only to defend the victories we have already won, but also to strive for greater victories. The common enemy of our two countries, American imperialism, still occupies South Korea and still occupies our territory of Taiwan. The crisis of war is still threatening Asia and the entire world. We must not allow American imperialism to occupy an inch of land in our two countries, and we must not allow the happy lives of our two countries' mothers and children to be destroyed again. We must drive American imperialism out of our country.

    The day when the socialist sunshine shines all over the three thousand miles of rivers and mountains is not far away. How much I yearn to see the sweeter smiles on those countless kind faces, how much I would like to hear those countless more joyful and louder songs. I welcome the great festival of the Korean people with incomparable excitement, and I constantly cheer and applaud for the prosperity and strength of the heroic country and for the eternal happiness of the Korean relatives!

    万古长青的友谊
    巴金
    我读到关于朝鲜的文章，就会想起我在那个国家过的那些日子。我在八年前写的一句话至今还强烈地打动我的心。我当时的确是用颤抖的手把它写下来的：“对这英雄的城市、美丽的国土和勇敢、热情的人民，我感到一种不能用语言说明的热爱。”我指的是：美帝国主义用四十二万多颗炸弹都炸不垮的平壤城，我指的是在血和火的熬煎中依然遍地鲜花的民主朝鲜，我指的是和我们一起共患难、待我们比亲人更亲的朝鲜人民。
    我常常把我在朝鲜过的日子看作我的一段最幸福的生活。在那一段时间里，我每时每刻都感受到深切的爱和强烈的恨，我也曾深刻地体会到血肉相连，亲如一家的友谊，更具体地懂得“一人吃苦、万人享福”的光荣。美国侵略军用现代化武器屠杀善良的朝鲜妇女，流天真孩子们的血，却始终毁不了朝鲜的一寸土地。我在朝鲜见过正在燃烧的房屋，还在冒烟的瓦砾堆，孩子在母亲的尸体旁边哀哭，老人对着废墟发呆。但是我也见过人们埋好死者，揩干眼泪，更坚强地继续前进，或者在瓦砾堆旁搭起简陋的房屋继续工作；妇女们填好炸弹坑在土里埋下种子，或者背着小孩在公路上挖土修路。敌机还在天空盘旋，可是在地下工厂里，年青的妇女用无比的劳动热情为国家生产财富，在地下剧场里有才能的演员们用光辉的英雄形象鼓舞人们的斗志……。用不着我把自己在朝鲜见过的许多人和许多事全写在这里，千千万万到过朝鲜的人都有比我更深的感受。没有人不痛恨嗜杀成性的美帝国主义侵略军！没有人不热爱勤劳、勇敢、热情的朝鲜人民！
    在阴湿的坑道里，在大树丛生的山上，在有花有水的山沟里，我常常听见年青的志愿军战士吐露他们的胸怀：为了夺回朝鲜阿妈妮（母亲）的幸福，甘愿献出个人的生命。在每个志愿军战士的心里，朝鲜人民的幸福和祖国人民的幸福多么紧密地连在一起。我自己也有过这样的感情。多少朝鲜阿妈妮的屋顶给我遮过雨和雪，使我受不到风吹霜冻。在寒冷的夜里，母亲一般的老大娘拾枯枝、捡干草，为我烧起了地炕，给我带来无比的温暖。在那些艰苦的时日里，朝鲜的老大伯老大娘分给了我们多少宝贵的东西。哪怕是一碗白开水，一声亲切的问好也含着深厚的友情。我和阿妈妮握手仿佛在握自己母亲的手；我牵着朝鲜孩子去看志愿军文工团的节目，好像是和自己的孩子一块儿走路。在农家的小院里，志愿军战士们帮忙阿妈妮打井，舂谷子，一边劳动一边谈笑，我在他们中间仿佛在一个幸福的大家庭里一样。在这样的生活中，我越来越强烈地感觉到一种心连心的友谊在不断地生长。我越爱朝鲜人民，就越恨美帝国主义。我至今还记得一位志愿军战士的话：“美帝国主义好霸道，不让朝鲜人生活！我要拼命打击敌人，给他们报仇。”朝鲜人民的血海深仇像火一样烧着中国人民的心。我们把朝鲜人民的苦难当作自己的苦难，也把朝鲜人民的胜利当作自己的胜利。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，终于把美国侵略军打得落花流水，给朝鲜人民报了仇，夺回了朝鲜母亲和孩子们的幸福生活，也保障了中国的社会主义建设事业。中朝两国英雄和烈士的血凝结在一起，培养了这棵万古长青的友谊之树，使它开出无限美丽的花朵。我们的友谊不是用语言来表示的，我们用行动来表示我们的友谊。我想举出几个尽人皆知的名字：罗盛教、吕玉久、朴在根、金永洙的母亲。……志愿军战士为朝鲜人交出性命，朝鲜人用自己的生命换回来志愿军战士的健康和自由。为了共同的理想和共同的目标，为了人民的幸福和人类解放的事业，谁都愿意献出自己的一切。志愿军战士视死如归，把吃苦当作最大的光荣；人民军战士奋勇杀敌，表现了无比的英雄气概；朝鲜人民顽强地、乐观地坚守着自己的岗位，勇敢地克服困难，支援战争，取得胜利。在共同的战斗中，我们两国人民的友谊越来越深，越来越固，越来越强。我在朝鲜常常听见人说：“中朝亲如一家。”这是大家心里的话。其实我们两国人民岂但亲如一家，我们比一家人更亲！这是一种振奋人心的友谊！鼓舞我们一同前进的友谊！
    今天的朝鲜早已不是我在七、八年前看见的朝鲜了。跨上千里马飞奔的朝鲜正在创造惊天动地的奇迹，而且一定会完成和平统一全国的光辉事业。我可以想像到朝鲜人民的昂扬斗志，冲天干劲和欢乐情绪。但是我还常常想起过去的那一段生活。我称它为幸福、因为我自己天天在十分鲜明的爱憎中受到了教育。在斗争最尖锐的地方，在斗争最激烈的时候，要迟疑、要旁观，是完全不可能的。人必须用行动来表示自己的思想感情。爱朝鲜人民就要为他们尽力，爱祖国就要献出一切来保卫祖国，恨美帝国主义就要用全力打击美国侵略军。由这种爱憎产生的无数可歌可泣的英雄事迹每天都在激动人心，推动人们前进。这样的环境，这样的气氛，可以说是一个炼人的洪炉。多少人在这个炉子里受过了锻炼，只可惜我留在朝鲜的时间太短了。
    在战斗中发展的中朝友谊，把我们两国人民紧紧地团结在一起，手携手、心连心迈步前进，不仅要保卫我们已经得到的胜利，而且还要争取更大的胜利，我们两国人民共同的敌人美帝国主义至今还侵占着南朝鲜，还霸占着我们的领土台湾。战争的危机还在威胁着亚洲和整个世界。我们决不能让美帝国主义占据我们两国的一寸土地，我们决不能让我们两国母亲和孩子们的幸福生活再遭到破坏。我们一定要把美帝国主义，从我们的国土上赶出去。
    社会主义阳光普照三千里江山的日子已经不远了。我多么渴望看见那无数亲切的脸上更甜的笑容，我多么愿意听到那无数更欢乐、更响亮的歌声。我怀着无比兴奋的心情迎接朝鲜人民伟大的节日，我为英雄国家的繁荣富强，我为朝鲜亲人的万代幸福不停地欢呼、鼓掌！
