Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 23rd. To adapt to the needs of the new situation of great development in education, the Jilin Province education system is vigorously establishing construction, instrument, and paper industries.

As of the end of June, schools at all levels throughout the province had established a total of 504 factories (or workshops) in the above three categories, including 184 brick and tile factories, 12 lime factories, 62 instrument factories, 12 paper mills, and 49 pulp mills. In the past six months, these enterprises have produced more than 96 million bricks (including some brick blanks), 9,700 tons of lime, more than 84,000 pieces of various teaching aids and instruments, 65.5 tons of paper, and 816 tons of pulp.

In order to fully implement the policy of combining education with productive labor, schools at all levels in Jilin Province established many factories in 1958, providing a convenient labor base for teachers and students. Most of the products produced were supplied to other units. However, with the great development of education, the schools' own needs for building materials and paper have increased year by year. Therefore, some schools have adopted indigenous methods to start their own brick and tile factories, lime factories, instrument factories, etc. This approach was supported by the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and began to be promoted throughout the province this spring.

After the education system units produced their own building materials, instruments, and paper, they vigorously promoted the development of education. After 14 middle schools in Dehui County established brick and tile factories, they used the bricks they produced to build school buildings. In the past two years, without increasing state investment, they built more than 2,000 square meters of school buildings than originally planned, which could be used as 38 classrooms to accommodate more than 2,100 students.

With the development of the teaching revolution, the demand for teaching instruments is increasing. At present, schools have arranged the production of 83 types of instruments. Jilin Normal University began producing demonstration slide rules last winter and has now produced 220, most of which have supported other schools in addition to meeting their own mathematics teaching needs. Teachers and students of Jilin Normal College produced two sets of analytical geometry teaching aids to meet their needs.

The Jilin Province education system has adopted various forms to run production enterprises on a large scale. Some are run directly by education administrative departments, some are jointly run by education administrative departments and schools, some are jointly run by schools and schools, and some are jointly run by schools and nearby people's communes. The Jilin City Education Bureau, in light of the specific conditions of each school, put forward different requirements so that the production enterprises of the city's education system can be complete. For example, the Beishan Experimental School in Jilin City used to produce cement, so it was decided that the school should focus on cement production; the Normal College was located in the suburbs, and the local soil was suitable for brick burning, so they focused on red brick production; the No. 13 Middle School and the No. 1 Middle School had larger woodworking factories, so they focused on wood processing and prefabrication. Some middle schools focused on producing teaching aids and specimens. It was also decided that schools in the city should produce paper, and schools in the counties under the city should produce pulp.

Schools run the above three types of factories from scratch, using local materials, adopting indigenous methods first and then foreign methods. When Jilin Normal College established a brick factory, there was only one worker and two shovels, but teachers, students, and workers worked together to overcome various difficulties. Without a brick kiln, they built a kiln while making blanks. By the end of June, they had not only built a brick kiln but also produced more than 100,000 brick blanks. Now, the factory is actively preparing brick-making machines and gradually moving from indigenous methods to foreign methods.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 23rd. A number of middle and higher schools in Shanxi Province have adopted indigenous methods combined with foreign technology to set up a number of paper mills.

The establishment of paper mills in middle and higher schools in Shanxi Province was proposed in order to meet the needs of the cultural revolution for paper. From May of this year to the present, more than 20 middle and higher schools in Shanxi Province have established paper mills. The paper mills run by six schools, including Jiexiu, Fanxiang, Liulin, and Hechang, have already started production. The production of these paper mills, in addition to meeting the paper needs of the schools, also supplies the county's paper needs. The teachers and students of the Chemistry Department of Shanxi Normal College spent three months turning a paper mill using indigenous methods into a paper mill with two large workshops and a complete set of equipment combining indigenous and foreign methods, from pulp cooking and beating to paper making. It can accommodate more than 30 students to work together, with a daily output of 1.5 tons. In order to meet the needs of large-scale production in paper mills, many schools have also established factories to produce bleaching powder, caustic soda, rosin, and glue to complement them. At present, teachers and students from more than 60 schools across the province are actively building paper mills, taking advantage of part of the summer vacation.

In the process of building factories, the schools adopted the method of learning while doing, and the equipment needed was solved by using local materials and replacing foreign materials with indigenous materials. When building a paper mill, Liulin Middle School in Lishi County, while building, sent people to Jiexiu Guoying Paper Mill and Jiexiu Middle School Paper Mill to learn technology. At the same time, teachers and students were combined, and the role of teachers was fully utilized. As a result, it only took a few days to build a small paper mill. When Ninggu Middle School in Pingyao County manufactured the paper machine frame, it used wood instead of steel, and the students of the woodworking factory made a wooden paper machine frame; if there was not enough cement for building water towers and pulp washing ponds, it used coal and stones instead, and the factory was quickly built in this way.

This batch of paper mills is the result of the great collaboration of workers, peasants, and students under the leadership of the Party. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, Taiyuan Boiler Factory, Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, and Lancun Paper Mill enthusiastically provided guidance and assistance in terms of technology and equipment when the schools built paper mills. The people's communes supplied the raw materials needed by the paper mills, such as rice straw.

Now these paper mills have become the bases for learning, productive labor, and scientific research in these schools. In the process of paper production, students have fully applied the knowledge they have learned in books to productive labor.

    适应教育事业发展  建立生产劳动基地
    吉林教育系统办建筑、仪器和造纸厂
    山西一批中等以上学校采用土洋结合办法生产纸张
    新华社长春23日电　吉林省教育系统，大力举办建筑、仪器
  造纸工业，以适应教育事业大发展新形势的需要。
    截止6月底，全省各级学校举办以上三类企业共五百零四个工厂（或车间），其中砖瓦厂一百八十四个，石灰厂十二个，仪器厂六十二个，造纸厂十二个，纸浆厂四十九个。半年来，这些企业共生产红砖（包括部分砖坯）九千六百多万块，石灰九千七百多吨，各种教具和教学仪器八万四千多件，纸张六十五点五吨，纸浆八百一十六吨。
    吉林省各级学校为了全面贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，在1958年就先后举办了许多工厂，为学校师生提供了方便的劳动基地。生产的产品大部分供应其他单位。但随着教育事业的大发展，学校本身对建筑材料和纸张的需要量逐年增多。因此，有些学校就采取土法上马的办法，自己创办砖瓦厂、石灰厂、仪器厂等。这种作法得到中共吉林省委支持，今年春季在全省范围内开始推广。
    教育系统各单位自己生产了建筑材料、仪器和纸张以后，有力地推动了教育事业的发展。德惠县的十四所中学建立了砖瓦厂以后，他们用自己生产的砖建筑校舍，两年来不用国家增加投资，比原计划多建校舍二千多平方米，可作三十八个教室，容纳二千一百多名学生。
    随着教学革命的发展，需要的教学仪器越来越多，现在各学校已安排生产的有八十三种。吉林师范大学去年冬天就开始生产演示计算尺，现在已生产出二百二十个，除满足自己数学教学需要之外，大部分支援了其他学校。吉林市师范专科学校师生们自己制作了两套解析几何教具，满足了需要。
    吉林省教育系统大办生产企业，采取了各种不同的形式，有教育行政部门直接办的，有教育行政部门和学校合办的，有学校和学校合办的，也有学校和附近人民公社合办的。吉林市教育局针对各学校的具体情况，提出了不同的要求，以便全市教育系统的生产企业能配成套。如吉林市北山实验学校过去生产过水泥，就确定这个学校以生产水泥为重点；师范专科学校设在市郊，附近的土质适合烧砖，他们就以生产红砖为重点；第十三中学和第一中学原有的木工厂较大，他们就以木材加工和预制为主。有的中学就着重生产教具和标本。并确定市内各学校生产纸张，市属各县的学校生产纸浆。
    各学校大办以上三类工厂，都是白手起家，就地取材，采取土法上马、先土后洋的办法办起来的。吉林市师范专科学校建立砖厂时只有一名工人，两把铁锹，但是教师、学生和工人一起想办法克服了各种困难，没有砖窑，他们就一边扣坯一边建窑，到6月下旬，不仅建起一座砖窑，还生产了十多万块砖坯。现在，这个厂正在积极筹备制砖机，逐步由土到洋。
    新华社太原23日电　山西省一批中等以上的学校采取土法上马、土洋结合的办法，办起一批造纸厂。
    山西省中等以上的学校兴办造纸厂，是适应文化革命形势对纸张需要而提出来的。从今年5月到现在，山西省已有二十多座中等以上的学校建立了造纸厂，介休、范享、柳林、贺昌等六座学校办的造纸厂已经开始生产。这些造纸厂的生产除满足本校用纸外，并供应了县里用纸的需要。山西师范学院化学系的师生们，用三个月的时间把一座土法生产的造纸厂变为现在有两个大型车间，从煮浆、打浆到造纸有着一套土洋结合设备的造纸厂，可以容纳三十多个学生一起生产劳动，日产量达到一吨半。为适应纸厂大量生产的需要，许多学校还建立生产漂白粉、火碱、松香、胶的工厂，使之配套。目前，全省有六十多个学校的师生，正利用一部分暑期，积极兴建纸厂。
    学校在建厂中，采取了边学边干的方法，所需的设备，采取就地取材、以土代洋的办法解决。离石县柳林中学在建造纸厂中，一边动手兴建，一边派人到介休国营造纸厂、介休中学造纸厂学习技术，同时，做到了老师和学生相结合，充分发挥了教师的作用，结果只用了几天的时间，就建起一座小型造纸厂。平遥县宁固中学制造造纸机架时，用木材代替钢材，由木工厂的学生动手制成木造纸机架；建筑水塔、洗浆池的水泥不够，就用石炭、石子代替，就这样很快地把厂建立起来。
    这批造纸厂，是在党的领导下，工、农、学大协作的战果。太原钢铁公司、太原锅炉厂、太原重型机器厂、太原矿山机器厂、兰村造纸厂，在学校建纸厂中，热情地从技术上和设备上给予指导和帮助。人民公社供应了纸厂所需要的稻草等原料。
    现在这批造纸厂已经成为这些学校的学习、生产劳动、科学研究的基地。在纸的生产过程中，使学生们在书本上所学到的知识在生产劳动中得到了充分的运用。
