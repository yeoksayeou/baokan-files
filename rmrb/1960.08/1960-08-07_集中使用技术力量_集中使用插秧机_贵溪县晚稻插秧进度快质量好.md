Concentrated Use of Technical Strength, Concentrated Use of Rice Transplanters
Guixi County's Late Rice Transplanting Progresses Rapidly with Good Quality

(Our Dispatch) The Guixi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized its experience in using rice transplanters for early and mid-season rice and recently concentrated 530 high-quality rice transplanters and 1,270 excellent rice transplanter operators to rush-transplant late rice, with good results.

During the early and mid-season rice transplanting this year, different methods were used in various places to promote rice transplanters, resulting in different outcomes. One method was to concentrate the rice transplanters in one or two brigades, focusing on their use first, achieving success, and then gradually promoting them, which yielded good results. Another method was to allocate the rice transplanters to various brigades for decentralized use, but as a result, the problems in the machines themselves and in operating techniques were not easily resolved, which affected the promotion.

Based on a comparison of the two methods, the County Committee adopted the former method in the second season's late rice transplanting, that is, concentrating elite forces and sharp instruments, organizing teams and groups, setting up fixed-point demonstrations, and gradually promoting them, in order to promptly summarize experience, cultivate skilled workers, improve machinery, expand influence, and achieve the goal of everyone knowing how to use them and every machine being used well. To this end, the county organized all machinery and personnel into teams and groups, designated twelve machine transplanting brigades, forty-seven machine transplanting teams, and one hundred and fifty-eight machine transplanting groups according to key demonstration areas. This approach has four major benefits:

1.	Great effect and great influence. Each demonstration area has dozens of rice transplanters, working in teams in the fields, filling the paddies, creating great momentum, speeding up the progress, and driving the surrounding masses. In the demonstration area of Fujiang Brigade, Luohe Commune, the County Committee concentrated twenty-one high-quality rice transplanters to transplant 240 mu of rice in three days on the large paddies on both sides of the road, increasing the daily transplanting progress of this brigade from 170 mu to 280 mu, and greatly advancing the entire transplanting time compared to the original plan. People passing by on both sides of the road praised it, and it spread everywhere. Luohe Brigade, which originally did not plan to use rice transplanters, immediately sent people to the commune's machinery factory to transport thirteen rice transplanters after seeing the demonstration transplanting, and the brigade's general branch secretary, Zhou Laisheng, personally took the lead in the field to promote them.

2.	Because the machines and personnel are concentrated, it is convenient for leadership and timely resolution of problems.

3.	Because the transplanting progress is accelerated, it is possible to free up sufficient time to refine land preparation and improve the quality of transplanting. Jintun Brigade of Tangwan Commune originally had a large transplanting task and had to rush the time, so they had to plant the fields after harvesting early rice by rolling them only once, which made the fields not rot and the soil not loose. Seeing that one person with a rice transplanter could do the work of three people, they freed up time to plow and harrow the second-crop fields again, ensuring that the seedlings were firmly rooted and guaranteeing the quality.

4.	It can accelerate the training of rice transplanter operators and improve transplanting techniques. The rice transplanter teams transplant rice during the day and study transplanting techniques at night. Therefore, many machine transplanters have achieved daily improvements in work efficiency and daily improvements in technology, forming a high tide of mutual competition and everyone striving to be first.

### 集中使用技术力量　集中使用插秧机  贵溪县晚稻插秧进度快质量好

    集中使用技术力量　集中使用插秧机
    贵溪县晚稻插秧进度快质量好
    本报讯　中共江西贵溪县委总结了使用插秧机插早中稻的经验，最近集中了五百三十部优质插秧机和一千二百七十名优秀插秧机手，抢插晚稻，效果良好。
    今年早中稻插秧时，各地在推广插秧机上，有两种不同方法，得出两种不同结果。一种方法是，集中插秧机到一两个大队，先重点使用，作出成绩后，再逐步推广，效果良好。另一种方法是，把插秧机拨给各个大队分散使用，结果因为机具本身和操作技术上存在的问题不容易解决，影响了推广。
    根据两种方法的比较，县委在二季晚稻栽插中，采取前一种方法，即集中精兵锐器，编队分组，定点示范，逐步推广的方法，以便及时总结经验，培养能手，改进机具，扩大影响，达到人人会用，部部用好的目的。为此，全县将所有的机具、人员编队分组，按重点示范区编为十二个机插大队，四十七个机插小队，一百五十八个机插小组。这样作的结果，有四大好处：
    一、效果大、影响大。每个示范区都拥有十几部以至几十部插秧机，成队下田，满坂都是，声势很大，加快了速度，又带动了周围群众。县委在罗河公社富江大队示范区，集中了二十一部优质插秧机，在马路两旁的大坂上，三天插秧二百四十亩，使这个大队的插秧日进度由一百七十亩提高到二百八十亩，整个栽插时间可比原计划大大提前。马路两旁来往的人们看了，个个称赞，处处传扬。原来不打算使用插秧机的罗河大队，看了示范插秧后，大队总支书记周来胜马上就派人到公社机械厂运来了十三部插秧机，亲自带头下田推广。
    二、由于机具和人员集中，就便于领导和及时解决问题。
    三、由于加快了栽插进度，可以腾出充分时间来精细整地，提高插秧质量。塘湾公社金屯大队原来因为栽插任务大，为了抢时间，只好把割了早禾的田打一次辘轴就栽下去，田不烂，泥土不松。他们看到插秧机一人能顶三人干活，于是便腾出了时间把二禾田再翻、耙一次，使秧苗根根落实，保证了质量。
    四、能加速培训插秧机手，提高栽插技术。插秧机队白天插秧，晚上研究栽插技术。因此，许多机插手做到了工效日日新、技术日日高，形成一个互相竞赛、人人争先的高潮。（附图片）
