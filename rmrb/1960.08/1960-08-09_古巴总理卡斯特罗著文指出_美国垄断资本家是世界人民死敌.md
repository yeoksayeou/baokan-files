Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City: According to TASS, Cuban Prime Minister Castro recently published an article in the Mexican weekly "Siempre" stating that the monopoly capital oligarchs who rule the United States are the deadly enemies of the progress and happiness of all peoples.

He wrote: Those who oppose us, by their attitude toward the Cuban people, show our brothers, the people of Latin American countries, that they are the deadly enemies of us and the Latin American people.

This article, written at the request of the editorial department of "Siempre," said: Some people want to torment us with hunger, attack us, reduce our sugar quota, confiscate our ships and planes, constantly accuse us, and threaten us. The aggressors have carried out this barbaric aggression against the people striving for freedom, attempting to say to the people of other Latin American countries: Do not try to strive for freedom! Do not try to build schools and hospitals! Do not try to reclaim your national resources! Do not try to reclaim your mines and oil, your industries and land! Do not try to become masters of your own economy! Do not try to gain full sovereignty! Do not dream of building school cities!

The article pointed out that the aspirations of the Cuban people are consistent with the aspirations of the people of Latin American countries, namely, economic and political liberation. Castro wrote: Imperialism cannot eliminate us. This is not only because we maintain complete unity domestically, but also because we receive fair support from the people of other countries.

Castro continued, we hope that Cuba will become a true homeland for its people. Cuba believes in the righteousness of its cause and does not want to lose its freedom. The people of all countries are always stronger than those who try to hinder their progress, freedom, and dignity. The revolution has taught us all to learn many things. We know that our progress depends solely on ourselves; if the labor of the people is not used for the benefit of their own people, full prosperity cannot be achieved.

    古巴总理卡斯特罗著文指出
    美国垄断资本家是世界人民死敌
    古巴人民的愿望是经济和政治的解放。古巴相信自己事业的正义性，不想失去自己的自由。各国人民总是比那些企图阻挠他们的进步、自由和尊严的人强大。帝国主义不可能消灭我们。
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城讯：古巴总理卡斯特罗最近在墨西哥“永久”周刊发表文章说，统治着美国的垄断资本寡头们是各国人民进步和幸福的死敌。
    他写道：那些反对我们的人以他们对古巴人民的态度向我们的兄弟——拉丁美洲各国人民表明，他们是我们和拉丁美洲人民的死敌。
    这篇应“永久”周刊编辑部的请求撰写的文章说：有人想用饥饿来折磨我们，对我们进行袭击，削减糖的限额，没收我们的船只和飞机，经常指责我们，威胁我们。侵略者对争取自由的人民进行了这种野蛮的侵略，企图对拉丁美洲其他国家的人民说：不要试图争取自由吧，不要试图建筑学校和医院，不要试图收回本国的资源，不要试图收回自己的矿井和石油、自己的工业和土地，不要试图成为本国经济的主人，不要试图获得全部主权，不要幻想建设学校城！
    文章指出，古巴人民的愿望和拉丁美洲各国人民的愿望是一致的，那就是经济和政治的解放。卡斯特罗写道：帝国主义不可能消灭我们。这不仅在于我们国内保持完全的一致，而且也在于我们得到其他国家人民公道的声援。
    卡斯特罗接着说，我们希望古巴成为本国人民真正的祖国。古巴相信自己事业的正义性，不想失去自己的自由。各国人民总是比那些企图阻挠他们的进步、自由和尊严的人强大。革命教导我们大家学会了许多东西。我们知道，我们的进步仅仅取决于我们；如果人民的劳动不是用来为本国人民谋福利，就不能得到全面的繁荣。
