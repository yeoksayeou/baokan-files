From our Hefei dispatch on the 5th: Responsible cadres at all levels in Bengbu Prefecture, Anhui Province, have gone deep into the fields and among the masses, working with veteran farmers and technicians to summarize the experience of high-yield sweet potato production over the years, meticulously studying the growth patterns of sweet potatoes. They are adopting measures based on different soils, different cultivation periods, different varieties, and different growth conditions, improving field management levels, and launching a management upsurge centered on weeding and topdressing fertilizer.

The Bengbu Prefecture has planted a total of 6,450,000 mu of spring and summer sweet potatoes this year, with generally good sowing quality. Whether high yields and bumper harvests can be achieved in the future depends on "management." Therefore, leading cadres at all levels throughout the region have gone deep into the masses and into the fields to summarize field management experience.

From the experience summarized in various places, the main laws of sweet potato growth are four points: First, the longer the tuber growth period, the higher the yield. For example, according to experiments conducted by the Xieji Brigade of the Dongfeng Commune in Dangshan County over the past two years, under the same soil and cultivation methods, extending the tuber growth period of sweet potatoes by one month generally increased production by more than half compared to those without extension. Second, the entire growth process of sweet potatoes is divided into two stages: above-ground growth and underground growth. The above-ground growth stage is the early growth stage, mainly for growing seedlings; the underground growth stage is the later growth stage, mainly for growing tubers. Third, since sweet potatoes are tuber crops, suitable for growing in sandy soils and sandy-silty mixed soils, it is necessary to improve the soil for planting sweet potatoes in excessively silty, excessively sandy, and saline-alkali land. Fourth, sweet potatoes like high temperatures and humidity, "fearing drought in the early stage, fearing flooding in the later stage, and fearing continuous cloudy days in between."

According to these "habits" of sweet potatoes, various places have universally mobilized the masses, adopting improved field management methods based on different soils, different cultivation periods, different varieties, and different growth conditions. First, in the early stage of sweet potato growth, management is focused on "early," and a series of measures such as adding water, adding fertilizer, weeding, and replanting seedlings are taken to achieve full and strong seedlings and early replanting, early branching, early tuber formation, and early ridge closure, in order to extend the tuber growth period and achieve high yields. Second, change turning over vines to lifting vines. The purpose of turning vines is mainly to prevent the growth of roots and the consumption of fertility and nutrients. In the past, the method of turning vines was used, but because the "Victory No. 100" sweet potato vines were very brittle, it often damaged the stems and leaves, and it was necessary to turn them over after turning them. Each time the vines are turned, it takes three to five days to turn over and return to normal growth. The entire sweet potato growth period requires about eight to ten turns of the vines, which is equivalent to one month of sweet potatoes not being able to grow normally, affecting yield. Third, improve fertilization methods. In the early stage of sweet potato growth, that is, the stage of growing vines, apply more nitrogen fertilizer; in the later stage of growth, that is, the stage of growing tubers, apply more phosphorus and potassium fertilizer; generally apply less fertilizer in the middle to control the vigorous growth of vines. In order to give full play to fertilizer efficiency, various places have also changed the past habit of surface fertilization to underground fertilization, and changed broadcast application to ditch application and hole application. Fourth, for excessively silty, excessively sandy, and saline-alkali land, apply more coarse manure to improve the soil. Fifth, pay attention to drainage and reasonable irrigation during the tuber growth period to avoid excessively wet ridge soil, which affects yield. Sixth, improve weeding methods. Sweet potatoes fear drought in the early stage, so deep weeding should be done to conserve soil moisture; the later stage is the tuber formation period, so shallow weeding should be done to avoid root damage.

After mastering the laws of sweet potato yield increase and finding improved field management methods, various places have greater confidence in striving for sweet potato bumper harvests and have taken organizational measures. The county and commune have designated a secretary to be in charge of and concurrently manage sweet potato field management, and have established a professional sweet potato field management team through comprehensive arrangement of manpower and material resources. At present, various places are vigorously grasping sweet potato seedling inspection, seedling replanting, weeding, and topdressing. As of July 21, all 1,780,000 mu of spring sweet potatoes in the entire prefecture have been weeded and topdressed once; among the 4,670,000 mu of summer sweet potatoes, more than 3,310,000 mu have been weeded, 1,500,000 mu have been topdressed, and irrigation, soil cultivation, and insect catching have been carried out.

From our Chengdu dispatch on the 5th: Xichong County, Sichuan Province, a major sweet potato producing area, manages sweet potatoes with the spirit of managing fine grains, implementing "careful management of coarse grains," and field management work is becoming more and more scientific.

Sweet potato is the main grain crop in Xichong County. The 230,000 mu of sweet potatoes planted last year accounted for only 43% of the total cultivated land area, but the output was equivalent to more than 60% of the total grain output for the year. Under the guidance of the idea of agriculture as the foundation, the Xichong County Party Committee attaches great importance to sweet potato production.

In order to meticulously manage sweet potatoes, the leaders of the county party committee and cadres at all levels often go deep down to work with commune members and technicians, closely integrate with production practice, and continuously carry out summary and exploration, so that field management work becomes more and more scientific. The weak seedlings in the early stage of transplanting, the late formation of tubers, the small size of tubers, and the vigorous growth of vines and leaves are prominent problems affecting high sweet potato yields. The leading comrades of the county party committee went to the Dongfeng Commune in the county to investigate and analyze two sweet potato fields with the same natural conditions last year but with a yield difference of more than one-third. At the same time, combined with their own planted sweet potato experimental fields with the same natural conditions and good or bad seedling growth, they further observed and studied, and through repeated comparative analysis, they discovered a regular problem: The high-yielding and well-growing sweet potato fields can avoid the phenomena of weak seedlings in the early stage, small tuber formation, and vigorous growth, mainly because the field management work in each period meets the requirements of sweet potato vines and leaves adapting to and promoting each other between roots and tubers; otherwise, vigorous growth or small tuber formation will occur. In order to clarify the requirements of the corresponding development of roots, tubers, vines, and leaves in sweet potato field management work, the county party committee further observed and found that the vines, leaves, roots, and tubers of sweet potatoes often exhibit unbalanced growth. The development of the two is adapted to each other, and the vines and leaves grow luxuriantly, thereby enhancing photosynthesis and promoting tuber growth. Only when the relationship between the above-ground and underground parts of sweet potatoes is adapted to each other can external conditions such as soil, fertilizer, and water play a greater role in increasing production. Therefore, in sweet potato field management, when providing nutrients to crops, attention should be paid to making vines and leaves develop correspondingly with roots and tubers, and helping them to continuously tend towards balance on a new basis. In order to make vines, leaves, roots, and tubers adapt to and promote each other, the county party committee, after investigation and research, proposed measures such as "three supplements" (supplementing seedlings, supplementing soil, and supplementing fertilizer), "three attacks" (fertilizing to attack roots and attack seedlings), and "one prevention" (preventing natural disasters as early as possible).

The thirty-four people's communes in the county conscientiously implemented the various measures proposed by the county party committee, carried out scientific management of sweet potatoes, and effectively promoted sweet potato production. At present, sweet potatoes throughout the county have entered the tuber expansion period, and the people's communes are doing everything possible to increase the application of potash fertilizer, enhance vine and leaf photosynthesis, and promote tuber growth.

    甘薯高产关键在于细管
    蚌埠专区总结经验找出甘薯增产规律
    西充县实行“粗粮细管”精心管理甘薯
    本报合肥5日电　安徽蚌埠专区各级党组织的许多负责干部深入田间、深入群众，和老农、技术人员共同总结历年来高产作物山芋
  （甘薯）丰产的经验，细致地研究山芋生长的规律，分别不同土壤、不同栽培时期、不同品种和不同的生长情况，采取措施，提高了田间管理水平，掀起了以锄草追肥为中心的管理高潮。
    蚌埠专区今年共栽春、夏山芋六百四十五万亩，播种质量一般较好。能否取得高产丰收，今后就在“管”上。因此，全区各级领导干部都纷纷深入群众、深入田间，总结田间管理的经验。
    从各地总结的经验来看，山芋生长的主要规律有四点：第一、山芋块生长期愈长就愈能增产。如砀山县东风公社谢集大队根据两年来的试验，在同等土质、同样栽培方法的情况下，山芋块延长生长期一个月，比没有延长的，一般要增产一半以上。第二、山芋整个的生长过程分为地面生长和地下生长两个阶段：地面生长阶段为生长前期，主要是长秧苗；地下生长阶段为生长后期，主要是长薯块。第三、由于山芋是块根作物，适宜于生长在沙质土壤和沙、淤两合土壤，因此，种植山芋的过淤、过沙和盐碱地就需要改造土壤。第四、山芋喜欢高温和湿润，“前怕旱，后怕淹，中间就怕连阴天”。
    根据山芋的这些“习性”，各地普遍发动群众，分别不同土壤、不同的栽培期、不同的品种和不同的生长情况，改进了田间管理的办法。第一，在山芋生长前期，紧紧抓住“早”字进行管理，通过加水、加肥、锄草、补苗等一系列措施，达到苗全苗壮和还苗早、分枝早、结块早、封垅早的目的，以延长芋块的生长期，实现丰产。第二，改翻秧为提秧。翻秧的目的，主要是防止生长根须，消耗地力和养分。过去采用翻藤的方法，因“胜利百号”芋藤很脆，往往伤害茎叶，而且翻后还要翻转。每翻一次秧，需要三天到五天，才能翻转过来，恢复正常生长。整个山芋生长期，大约要翻八次到十次秧，这样就等于有一个月的时间山芋不能正常生长，影响增产。第三，改进追肥方法，在山芋生长前期，即长秧子的时期，多追氮肥；在生长后期，即长芋块时期，多追磷、钾肥；中间一般要少追肥，以控制秧苗疯长。为充分发挥肥效，各地还改变过去地面追肥的习惯为地下追肥，以及改撒追为沟追、穴追。第四，对过淤、过沙和盐碱地，多追施粗肥，以改良土壤。第五，在芋块生长时期，注意排水和合理灌溉，避免垅土过湿，影响增产。第六，改进锄草办法。山芋生长前期怕旱，要锄深保墒；后期是结薯块时期，要浅锄，以免伤根。
    各地在掌握了山芋增产的规律，找出了改进田间管理的办法以后，对争取山芋丰产信心更大，并从组织上采取了措施。县、社都确定一位书记专管和兼管山芋田间管理工作，通过全面安排人力物力，建立了山芋田间管理专业队。目前，各地都在大抓山芋查苗、补苗、锄草、追肥。到7月21日止，全专区一百七十八万亩春山芋已全部锄草、追肥一次；四百六十七万亩夏山芋中，也有三百三十一万多亩锄了草，一百五十万亩追了肥，并进行了灌溉、培土、捉虫。
    本报成都5日电　四川省盛产红薯的西充县，以管理细粮的精神管理红薯（甘薯），实行“粗粮细管”，田间管理工作越作越科学。
    红薯是西充县的主要粮食作物。去年种植的二十三万亩红薯，仅占总耕地面积43％，产量却相当于全年粮食总产量的60％以上。中共西充县委在以农业为基础的思想指导下，十分重视红薯生产。
    为了精细管好红薯，县委领导和各级干部都经常深入下去与社员和技术人员一道，紧密结合生产实践，不断进行总结和探索，使田间管理越作越科学。移栽初期，薯苗较弱，薯块形成较迟、长得较小，藤叶疯长等，是影响红薯高产的突出问题。县委领导同志就深入到该县东风公社，对去年自然条件相同、但产量相差三分之一以上的两块薯地，进行考查分析，同时还结合自己种植的自然条件相同，苗稼生长有好坏的两处红薯试验田，进一步观察研究，通过反复对比分析，发现了一个带有规律性的问题：产量高、生长好的薯地，所以能避免前期苗弱以及结薯小和疯长等现象，主要是各个时期的田间管理工作，符合红薯藤叶与根、块相互适应，相互促进的要求；反之，就出现疯长或结薯小等现象。为了弄清红薯田间管理工作中根、块与藤、叶相应发展的要求，县委又进一步深入观察，发现红薯藤、叶与根、块，经常出现生长不平衡现象，两者的发展相适应，藤、叶就生长茂密，从而增强光合作用，促进薯块生长。只有当红薯地上部分与地下部分的关系相适应，那么土、肥、水等外部条件就能起到更大的增产作用。因此，在红薯田间管理中，给作物提供营养物质时，就要注意使藤叶与根块相应发展，帮助它们不断在新的基础上趋于平衡。为了使藤、叶与根、块相互适应，相互促进，县委经过调查研究，提出了“三补”（补苗补土补肥）、“三攻”（施肥攻根攻苗）、“一防”（及早防止自然灾害）等措施。
    全县三十四个人民公社认真贯彻了县委提出的各项措施，对红薯进行科学管理，有效地促进了红薯生产。目前，全县红薯已进入薯块膨胀时期，各人民公社正千方百计增施钾肥，增强藤叶光合作用，促进薯块生长。
