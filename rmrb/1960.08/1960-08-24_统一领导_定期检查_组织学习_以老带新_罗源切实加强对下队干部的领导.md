Unified Leadership, Regular Inspection, Organized Study, Experienced Guidance:
Luoyuan Effectively Strengthens Leadership over Cadres Sent to Teams

    (Our report) Fuzhou, Fujian - Luoyuan County Party Committee is strengthening its leadership over cadres at all levels who are deeply involved in the front lines of production. Based on different situations, it is taking measures such as strengthening education, providing specific assistance, and establishing a responsibility system to promote further improvement in the work style of cadres at the front lines and to better lead production.

    In order to effectively strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, especially grain production, the Luoyuan County Party Committee transferred more than 900 cadres (accounting for 90% of the total number of cadres) to the grassroots level to participate in and lead production. After these cadres went to the grassroots level, the vast majority developed an excellent work style, eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, closely connecting with the masses, and doing their work well. However, a small number of cadres still had some problems after going to the front lines. Some cadres went down physically, but their thinking didn't follow; some were just buried in labor without properly leading production; some only focused on specific points, neglecting the overall picture, and didn't do a comprehensive job. The County Party Committee analyzed the situation and problems of the cadres after they went to the front lines and believed that the main reasons were that some cadres had insufficient understanding of the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation, and the Party committees at all levels lacked specific leadership for the cadres at the grassroots level, so the problems encountered by the cadres after they went down were not resolved in time. In response to the above situation, the Luoyuan County Party Committee immediately convened a meeting of the County Party Committee Standing Committee and the first secretaries of the commune Party committees to conduct research and discussion and took four major measures: First, the Party committees at all levels should effectively strengthen the leadership of the cadres on the front lines of production. The five secretaries and nineteen members of the County Party Committee leading production in each commune should take the regular inspection of the work of cadres at all levels as an important task. The commune Party committees and the brigade Party branches should implement unified leadership over the cadres sent down from the county, strictly enforce Party organizational life for cadres. The communes and brigades should regularly inspect the work of the cadres sent to the countryside. The communes and teams should also use the "two-five system" learning time to organize the cadres sent to the countryside to carry out theoretical and policy studies together to improve their political and ideological level; second, cadres sent to the countryside are required to effectively improve their leadership style. All cadres at all levels who go to the front lines must bring their luggage and bedding to settle down in the production teams and resolutely eat, live, work, and consult with the vast number of commune members, integrating with the masses; third, establish a "double-package" leadership responsibility system that covers both the central task and specific business. Cadres of various departments and systems must first serve the central task, do a good job in the central task, and combine this with doing a good job in departmental work, so that departmental work and the central task are unified; fourth, the commune Party committees and brigade Party branches should separately adopt methods such as "experienced cadres guiding new cadres" and "pairing strong and weak" to provide specific assistance to the cadres sent to the teams. For those who are not familiar with agricultural production technology, the Party committee should try to assign agricultural technicians to work with them and help them learn technology; for those who have little practical work experience, the Party committee should pay attention to specifically helping them improve their work ability.

    In order to enable all communes, teams, and cadres at all levels in the county to implement the above measures well, the County Party Committee also adopted the method of inserting red flags and erecting pace-setter signs, commending the Jiuqi Brigade Party Branch of Chengguan Commune, which effectively strengthened the leadership of the cadres sent to the teams and achieved particularly outstanding results, and Xue Longmu and other cadres who went to the grassroots level and shared weal and woe with the masses and were known by the masses as "six-good cadres."

    After the County Party Committee adopted the above measures, the Party committees at all levels greatly strengthened the specific leadership of the cadres sent to the countryside who were deeply involved in the front lines. At present, among the 780 cadres from county-level agencies who have gone to the front lines, the vast majority can both participate in production and lead production well. After the cadres throughout the county further improved their leadership style, they universally strengthened the leadership of weak areas. Among the 185 backward teams in the county, the summer harvest and summer planting work of 135 teams has been done very well. (Attached picture)

    统一领导　定期检查　组织学习　以老带新
    罗源切实加强对下队干部的领导
    本报讯　福建罗源县委加强对深入生产第一线的各级干部的领导，根据不同情况，采取加强教育，具体帮助，建立责任制等措施，促使深入第一线的干部进一步改进作风，更好地领导生产。
    罗源县委为了切实加强农业生产、特别是粮食生产第一线的领导，抽调了九百余名干部（占干部总数的90％）深入基层参加生产领导生产。这些干部下到基层后，绝大多数都发扬优良作风，和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，密切联系群众，做好工作。但是也有小部分干部深入第一线后，还存在着一些问题。有些干部是人下去了，思想没有下去；有的光埋头劳动，没有很好领导生产；有的光抓点，丢了面，没有全面做好工作。县委分析了干部深入第一线后的情况和问题，认为主要原因是一部分干部对以农业为基础的方针认识不足，各级党委对深入基层的干部缺乏具体领导，以致干部深入下去以后碰到的问题未能及时解决。针对以上情况，罗源县委立即召开县委常委、公社党委第一书记会议，进行研究讨论，采取了四大措施：一、各级党委切实加强对在生产第一线的干部的领导，在各公社领导生产的县委五个书记和十九个委员应把定期检查各级干部的工作情况作为一个重要任务。各公社党委和大队党支部对县里下去的干部要实行统一领导，严格干部组织生活，公社、大队定期对下乡干部的工作进行检查，各社队还要利用“二五制”的学习时间，组织下乡干部一起进行理论、政策学习，以提高他们的政治思想水平；二、要求下乡干部切实改进领导作风，凡是到第一线的各级干部，都要将行李铺盖带到生产小队安家落户，坚决与广大社员同吃同住同劳动同商量，和群众打成一片；三、建立既包中心又包业务的“双包”领导责任制，各部门各系统干部必须首先服务中心，搞好中心，结合搞好部门工作，使部门工作和中心工作统一起来；四、公社党委、大队党支部要分别采取“以老带新”、“强弱搭配”等办法，对下队干部进行具体帮助，凡是对农业生产技术不熟悉的，党委应尽量调配农业技术干部和他们一起工作，帮助他们学习技术；凡是实际工作经验少的，党委要注意具体帮助他们提高工作能力。
    为了使全县各社队和各级干部很好地贯彻以上措施，县委还采取了插红旗立标兵的办法，表扬了切实加强对下队干部领导、成绩特别突出的城关公社九溪大队党支部，和深入基层与群众同甘共苦被群众称为“六好干部”的薛隆木等一批干部。
    县委采取上述措施后，各级党委大大加强了对深入第一线的下乡干部的具体领导。目前，县级机关下到第一线的七百八十个干部中，绝大多数都能做到既参加生产又领导好生产，全县干部进一步改进领导作风后，普遍加强了薄弱地区的领导，全县一百八十五个落后小队中，已有一百三十五个队的夏收夏种工作做得很出色。（附图片）
