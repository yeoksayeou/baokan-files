On the Technical Transformation of Agriculture in Our Country
Niu Zhonghuang

China can only completely change its socio-economic outlook when it has thoroughly completed the socialist transformation in the socio-economic system and, in the technical field, uses machinery in all departments and places where machinery can be used.
           — Mao Zedong: "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation"

Expediting the Technical Transformation of Agriculture is a Great Historical Task for Our Country Today

Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the emergence of the people's communes and the continuous great leap forward in the national economy over the past two years have propelled China's socialist construction into a new stage, namely, the stage of sustained leap forward.

The new stage presents us with new tasks, one of the most important of which is that, while accelerating socialist industrialization, we must expedite the technical transformation of agriculture to further closely integrate the development of industry and agriculture. This is the new content that the Party's policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, with agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, is given in the new stage. Compleeting this task will create new material foundations for further consolidating and developing the worker-peasant alliance in our country; and open up broader prospects for the continuous leap forward of socialist construction in our country.

Realizing the technical transformation of agriculture is a fundamental task of socialist construction. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "China can only completely change its socio-economic outlook when it has thoroughly completed the socialist transformation in the socio-economic system and, in the technical field, uses machinery in all departments and places where machinery can be used."

To realize the technical transformation of agriculture is to gradually but rapidly change our country's agricultural production from mainly using manual tools and animal-powered tools to mainly using machines; from mainly using human and animal power to mainly using mechanical power and electricity; to transform drought-prone and waterlogged lands into lands that guarantee harvests regardless of drought or flood, and to replace human-powered drainage and irrigation with machine-powered drainage and irrigation; and to change from mainly using manually processed fertilizers to mainly using mechanically manufactured fertilizers (including organic chemical fertilizers and inorganic chemical fertilizers), so that in a relatively short period, China's agriculture can shift from its current backward technical foundation to the technical foundation of modern large-scale production.

Why is it necessary to highlight the task of expediting the technical transformation of agriculture now?

First, to further implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and to make the growth of agricultural production further adapt to the development of industrial production and the requirements of the entire national economy. As everyone knows, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, a new and gratifying trend has emerged in the development of China's national economy, that is, the situation in which the growth rate of agriculture lagged behind the growth rate of industry in the past few years has begun to change. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the average annual growth rate of industry was 18%, and the average annual growth rate of agriculture was 4.5%, with the growth rate of industry being four times that of agriculture. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the growth rate of industry was 66.2%, and the growth rate of agriculture was 25%, with the growth rate of industry being 2.6 times that of agriculture. In the continued Great Leap Forward of 1959, the growth rate of industry was 39.3%, and the growth rate of agriculture was 16.7%, with the growth rate of industry being 2.35 times that of agriculture. That is to say, agriculture is constantly catching up at a rapid speed. However, if we want to enable agriculture to continue to leap forward continuously, and to further approach and coordinate the development speed of agriculture and industry, relying on the existing technology of agriculture is obviously not enough.

Although China's agriculture has made great leaps forward in the past two years, all undertakings in our country are developing at a high speed, and the current level of agricultural production cannot meet the needs of annually increasing commodity grain and industrial raw materials. According to preliminary estimates, to adequately meet the needs of all the people for grain and to have enough feed to breed livestock, China's grain output needs to increase at least twofold above the current level. To adequately meet the clothing needs of the Chinese people, in addition to actively developing chemical fibers, just in terms of the people's needs for cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and cotton wadding, cotton production needs to increase at least threefold above the current level. And other agricultural and livestock products need to have even greater growth. Obviously, to meet this need, there must be higher agricultural labor productivity and higher yield per mu. To achieve this, it is necessary to realize the technical transformation of agriculture.

Second, to more fully utilize the superiority of the people's communes, so that China's agriculture can continue to maintain a leaping development speed. The people's communes in rural China have opened up infinitely broad prospects for large-scale agricultural production and the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. As Comrade Shaoqi pointed out in "The Victory of Marxism-Leninism in China," it "can accommodate different degrees of productive forces and correspondingly different levels of production relations in socialist and communist societies." Since 1958, the Great Leap Forward in China's agriculture, the great development of various undertakings in rural areas, especially the movement to vigorously develop farmland water conservancy construction and rural industries, and the mass steel-making movement, have only been the initial demonstrations of the power of the people's communes. To more greatly and more fully utilize the superiority of the people's communes in comprehensive management of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, and the all-round development of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, to enable agricultural production to continuously leap forward, it is necessary to gradually and rapidly improve from the current backward level of mainly using simple tools and relying on manual operations to the advanced level of mainly relying on machine operations in terms of production technology, which requires completing the technical transformation of agriculture and realizing the modernization of agriculture.

Third, another important reason why our Party is now prominently proposing the issue of expediting the technical transformation of agriculture is that: due to the Great Leap Forward in industry, agriculture, and other undertakings, China has changed from a country with a surplus of labor to a country with a shortage of labor. In our large country with a population of more than 600 million, feeling a shortage of labor is a very good thing. In the Great Leap Forward of industry in 1958, the average number of employees nationwide increased by several million compared to the previous year, most of whom came from agriculture, and the continued leap forward of industry and other undertakings also requires providing more and more labor from agriculture. At the same time, the Great Leap Forward in agriculture has also greatly increased the labor used in production and construction. This is a new problem that is becoming increasingly acute. To solve this problem well, on the one hand, we must continue to tap the potential of labor by further improving the labor enthusiasm of the people's commune members, rationally using labor, improving labor organization, promoting advanced experience, improving management systems, and consolidating labor discipline. In these aspects, we have indeed achieved remarkable results. But at the same time, it should also be seen that, under the conditions that the broad masses of farmers currently universally use manual tools for production, the exertion of this potential is ultimately limited to a certain extent. Only by expediting the technical transformation of agriculture and greatly improving labor productivity can we fundamentally solve this problem. This is a great historical task placed before the Chinese people.

Finally, realizing the technical transformation of agriculture is of great significance for further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. As everyone knows, the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class in our country was established on the basis of land reform during the democratic revolution. The Party led the people of the whole country to achieve a complete victory in the New Democratic Revolution on this basis. After the completion of land reform, the worker-peasant alliance in our country was established on the basis of agricultural cooperation, on which basis we achieved the victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. Now, the worker-peasant alliance in our country has entered a new stage, in which the worker-peasant alliance must not only be established on the basis of the rural people's communes, but also on the basis of agricultural mechanization. Therefore, actively carrying out the technical transformation of agriculture will further consolidate and develop the worker-peasant alliance in our country, thereby achieving the complete victory of socialist construction.

Main Contents of Realizing the Technical Transformation of Agriculture in Our Country

The specific contents of realizing the technical transformation of agriculture are to realize the mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification of agriculture. These three aspects are interconnected and mutually promoting, but the central link is mechanization. Because in the process of realizing the technical transformation of agriculture, agricultural mechanization has a particularly important role. It must not only serve agricultural production itself, but also serve the water conservancy and electrification of agriculture.

Realizing agricultural mechanization is to gradually and actively change the current agricultural production in our country from mainly using manual tools and animal-powered tools to mainly using machines. Machines are the most powerful means to improve agricultural labor productivity and save labor. According to materials from Heilongjiang Province: the labor value and commodity rate of agricultural products created by using different agricultural production tools are very different. Taking 1959 as an example, state-owned farms that have basically realized mechanization created an average output value of about 3,000 yuan per worker per year, produced about 30,000 jin of grain, and had a commodity rate of 74%. Rural people's communes that have realized semi-mechanization (mainly using new-style farm tools, with a small number of tractors) created an average output value of about 1,200 yuan per worker per year, produced about 15,000 jin of grain, and had a commodity rate of 60%. While rural people's communes that used a larger proportion of old-style farm tools created an average output value of about 700 yuan per worker per year, produced about 8,000 jin of grain, and had a commodity rate of only about 40%. It can be seen that using machines increases labor productivity by one time and the output of commodity grain by 1.47 times compared to using new-style farm tools; and increases labor productivity by 2.75 times and the output of commodity grain by nearly six times compared to using old-style farm tools. In addition, according to materials from the counties under Tianjin Municipality, just realizing the mechanization of rice and flour processing, the mechanization of pig and livestock feed processing, the mechanization and factory production of sewing and shoe making, can save 420,000 workers, which is equivalent to 14% of the total labor force in the city's rural areas. From these facts, it can be seen that: only by gradually replacing the backward manual tools that are commonly used in rural areas with mechanized farm tools, drainage and irrigation machinery, rural transportation tools, and agricultural and sideline product processing tools, can the labor productivity of our country's agriculture be rapidly improved, the physical labor of farmers can be reduced, and it is possible to extract a large amount of labor from the agricultural front to meet the needs of the increasingly developing industry and other aspects of the national economy.

Under the current conditions, to realize agricultural mechanization, we should start with the most labor-intensive places in rural areas; we should focus the mechanization on operations and crops that require a lot of labor, are highly labor-intensive, and have urgent agricultural time requirements. Generally speaking, agricultural field operations, such as plowing, harrowing, sowing, inter-tillage, plant protection, harvesting, as well as farmland drainage and irrigation, fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer production, rural transportation, agricultural and sideline product processing, animal husbandry, and afforestation, all require a lot of labor and are highly labor-intensive. Especially field operations, drainage and irrigation, fertilizer accumulation and production, rural transportation, and agricultural and sideline product processing require even more effort. After the promotion of the "Eight-Character Charter" for increasing agricultural production, the above-mentioned aspects are more urgently in need of mechanization. Therefore, it is of great significance to first realize semi-mechanization and mechanization in these aspects.

In order to realize agricultural mechanization, in addition to the active efforts of rural people's communes' industries, the departments producing agricultural machinery should, on the one hand, fully utilize the production potential of existing enterprises, resolutely implement the policy of simultaneously adopting foreign methods and indigenous methods of production, and gradually carry out technical transformation of existing enterprises, so as to increase the production of various agricultural machinery and improved farm tools as much as possible to meet the current needs of agriculture; on the other hand, it is necessary to carry out the basic construction of new enterprises according to the plan of agricultural mechanization, and expand the production capacity of modern agricultural machinery according to plan. Through these two aspects of efforts, the production capacity of agricultural machinery will be greatly improved, so as to continuously manufacture a variety of machines to equip agriculture.

Realizing farmland water conservancy is to gradually irrigate all the land that can be irrigated with water. To achieve that heavy rain does not cause disasters, and that good harvests are guaranteed without rain; that slopes are terraced, plains are networked with rivers, that gullies become platforms, that projects are systematic, that water lifting is mechanized, and that mountain slopes are greened. Thus enabling river basins to withstand certain floods; enabling flood-prone areas to withstand certain waterlogging; enabling the vast majority of cultivated land across the country to withstand extreme droughts; enabling gullies to prevent soil from sliding downhill and water from leaving the gully during rainstorms; and preventing coastal areas from tidal flooding and water disasters. After basically realizing water conservancy, we will further move towards the even greater goal of conquering nature. We will gradually build a more complete national navigation network throughout the country, build a large power grid centered on large hydropower stations, combine large, medium, and small power stations, and combine power stations using various energy sources such as water, fire, gas, and wind to realize rural electrification.

To realize water conservancy, in addition to further improving existing irrigation systems and gradually building new irrigation systems, we must gradually replace human-powered irrigation with machines. According to existing materials, a one-horsepower drainage and irrigation machine can replace eight laborers. We now have more than three million horsepower of drainage and irrigation machinery, and to realize the mechanization of drainage and irrigation, we need to produce more drainage and irrigation machinery.

While developing agricultural mechanization and water conservancy, we must also correspondingly solve the problem of rural power and realize rural electrification. To change the situation in which agriculture mainly uses human and animal power as the basic power to mainly using electricity and other mechanical power. Power energy is an indispensable condition for realizing agricultural mechanization and electrification. And in terms of power energy, we have very favorable conditions. China's hydropower resources are about 580 million kilowatts, ranking first in the world. Coal resources are also very abundant. In addition, there are also natural gas, wind power, solar energy and other power energy that can be used. We should fully utilize these favorable conditions, make overall plans, strengthen leadership, and actively develop rural hydropower stations and thermal power stations, as well as natural gas stations, biogas stations, etc., in accordance with local conditions. In particular, we must combine with the water conservancy of agriculture, comprehensively utilize water resources, make full use of the drop of water, carry out a large number of designs of medium and small hydropower stations and thermal power stations, and plan to produce small power generation equipment and corresponding supporting equipment to accelerate the electrification of agriculture.

Widely adopting chemistry in agriculture is an important aspect of the technical transformation of agriculture. In this regard, the current main task is to actively increase the production of chemical fertilizers. Fertilizer is one of the basic elements of increasing agricultural production. At present, our country uses natural fertilizers (organic fertilizers) in large quantities and universally. Although the amount of chemical fertilizers used has been increasing year by year, it is still far from meeting the needs of agricultural production for chemical fertilizers.

An important issue in developing chemical fertilizers at present is to change from mainly using manual processing of fertilizers to mainly using machine manufacturing of fertilizers, including inorganic chemical fertilizers and organic chemical fertilizers. According to a survey in Qianhongzhao County, Shanxi Province: one jin of machine-made inorganic chemical fertilizer can top 40 jin of artificially made miscellaneous fertilizer or 60 jin of soil manure. At present, the amount of labor for manufacturing and transporting soil manure accounts for 50% of the amount of labor for manufacturing and transporting fertilizer. Even if one jin of chemical fertilizer tops 50 jin of soil manure, if half of the current soil manure is replaced by machine-made inorganic chemical fertilizer, then an ordinary county with 150,000 agricultural workers can save 15,000 to 20,000 workers. If organic chemical fertilizer is also replaced by mechanical processing instead of manual processing, then even more manpower can be saved. In terms of the effect of fertilizer, one jin of inorganic chemical fertilizer can increase the production of three jin of grain or one jin of seed cotton, which is many times greater than the effect of ordinary soil manure. Therefore, we must accelerate the development of the chemical fertilizer industry with greater efforts.

Of course, when we are actively developing the production of inorganic chemical fertilizers, we must not neglect the increase in the production of organic fertilizers because of this. Even after our country can produce a lot of inorganic chemical fertilizers, organic fertilizers should not only not be reduced, but should also be greatly increased. Organic fertilizer is also a chemical fertilizer, which can better cultivate the fertility of the soil than inorganic fertilizer. Therefore, raising pigs, sheep, and large livestock to accumulate fertilizer, especially raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer and manufacture a large amount of organic chemical fertilizer, is something that cannot be ignored at any time. One pig can accumulate about 10,000 jin of manure per year, which is equivalent to 120 jin of top-quality inorganic chemical fertilizer. It can be seen that one pig is a very good small organic chemical fertilizer factory. And pig manure, this organic chemical fertilizer, is much better than inorganic chemical fertilizer.

Our country now has the conditions to realize the technical transformation of agriculture

Our proposal to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture is not only necessary, but also has certain conditions.

Our country has established the foundation of socialist industrialization, and after the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, this foundation is constantly expanding. We already have a series of new industrial sectors, including industrial production sectors that directly serve the technical transformation of agriculture. In particular, due to the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, industries have sprung up everywhere, and a preliminary urban and rural industrial network from cities to rural people's communes has been established on our vast land. Many county towns, market towns, and people's communes have small farm tool manufacturing plants, farm tool repair plants, native chemical fertilizer plants, and native pesticide plants. Some places have also established small coal kilns, small iron smelting plants, small oil refineries, small cement plants, small power stations, etc., according to local resource conditions. This means that we have both the country's large-scale industry and the local medium and small-scale industry, especially the industries run by counties and communes, which makes us have not only the main force, but also a strong local army in our march towards agricultural modernization.

The realization of people's communes in rural areas in our country is another fundamental condition for the leap from small-scale operation using animal-powered farm tools to large-scale operation using machines in our country's agriculture. The superiority of the "large size and high degree of public ownership" of the people's communes has opened up infinitely broad prospects for the technical transformation of agriculture. The people's communes are large in scale, have a wide range of activities, and have a high degree of collectivization. They are not only convenient for the simultaneous development of industry, agriculture, military affairs, education, and commerce, and the comprehensive management of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, and the development of diversified economies, but also facilitate the acceleration of the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, and facilitate the exertion of the power of agricultural machinery.

The people's communes have promoted the Great Leap Forward in production and improved the accumulation rate of agriculture, which is also an important condition for realizing the technical transformation of agriculture. As everyone knows, under the previous individual economy conditions, the accumulation rate of agriculture was very low, and in times of disaster, not only was there no accumulation, but it was also necessary to live off the old capital. During the period of agricultural cooperatives, the accumulation rate of agriculture increased, and the possibility of increasing accumulation became even greater after the people's communes. The accumulation of rural people's communes in 1958 reached 10 billion yuan, which was more than double the accumulation of agricultural cooperatives in 1957, and was equivalent to more than half of the total accumulation of individual farmers and agricultural cooperatives during the First Five-Year Plan period. The increase in agricultural accumulation has greatly enhanced the strength to purchase machines, chemical fertilizers, and other means of production.

In addition, in the past few years, many state-owned farms and production teams of people's communes (the original advanced cooperatives) have done a lot of experimental and promotion work on the technical transformation of agriculture, especially on the adoption of new-style farm tools, improved farm tools, and the realization of semi-mechanization and mechanization of agriculture, and have also prepared conditions for accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture.

Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of our country have shown a high degree of enthusiasm for the technical transformation of agriculture. Many factories, mines, troops, organs, and schools across the country have regarded supporting the technical transformation of agriculture as a glorious task and have actively invested in this movement. Many factories and mines have linked up with the people's communes and are doing everything possible to provide support. Some directly help the people's communes establish farm tool manufacturing and repair factories; some extract idle machinery and equipment and collect scrap materials to help the communes; some send hundreds or thousands of technicians to form service teams to go deep into the rural areas to repair machinery for the people's communes and teach farmers operating techniques; and many factories and mines have fixed support objects, made plans, established systems, and are responsible to the end. The agricultural machinery manufacturing departments are planning and rushing to manufacture various agricultural machinery day and night. The People's Liberation Army has carried forward the glorious tradition of consistently actively supporting local mass movements, and has drawn a large number of manpower and material resources to help communes produce agricultural machinery and train technical personnel. The commercial departments have tried every means to clear warehouses, tap potential, exchange information, and communicate what is needed, and are increasingly playing the role of the logistics department for industrial support of agriculture. Many organs and schools also use all possible conditions to provide farmers with enthusiastic help in culture and technology. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the whole people, a mass agricultural technical transformation movement has been vigorously launched.

Resolutely Implement the Policy of "Walking on Two Legs"

The technical transformation of agriculture should adhere to the policy of "walking on two legs," that is, to earnestly implement the policy of simultaneously developing modern machinery and improved tools, simultaneously developing mechanization and semi-mechanization and improved farm tools, and simultaneously adopting foreign methods and indigenous methods.

According to the specific conditions of our country at the present time, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have proposed that to realize agricultural mechanization in our country, it is necessary to achieve "small solutions within four years, medium solutions within seven years, and large solutions within ten years." Starting from 1959, within ten years, we must gradually mechanize agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries production, water conservancy construction, farmland irrigation, fertilizer production, agricultural product processing, transportation, rural construction, etc. However, in the first four years, due to insufficient conditions such as agricultural machinery production, the focus should be on agriculture and animal husbandry, and strive to achieve small-scale mechanization of agricultural and animal husbandry production and basic mechanization of farmland drainage and irrigation first. Within these four years, the suburbs of large cities, commodity grain bases, major economic crop bases, and major non-staple food production bases should first realize initial mechanization, while most other regions across the country should mainly promote semi-mechanization and improved farm tools. Within seven years, due to the gradual development of the agricultural machinery industry, the supply of agricultural machines will greatly increase, and then it will be possible to realize mechanization in more than half of the country's regions. Around ten years later, it will be possible to basically realize mechanization and a considerable degree of electrification throughout the country.

At present, in terms of agricultural mechanization, the main reliance is on improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools. Most regions and most agricultural production departments are reforming existing farm tools, water lifting tools, transportation tools, and agricultural and sideline product processing tools; at the same time, actively creating conditions for agricultural mechanization. In those places with more land and fewer people, convenient transportation, and a high commodity rate of agricultural products, mechanization should be actively realized; however, in these areas, auxiliary semi-mechanization and improved tools are also needed along with mechanization. At present, a large-scale tool reform movement is being carried out in the vast rural areas of the country. Tool reform has developed from reforming single pieces to reforming complete sets; from reforming farming tools to comprehensively reforming agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery tools, as well as collective living tools; from improvement based on existing tools to the creation of semi-mechanized and mechanized new tools. In some important agricultural projects in some regions, semi-mechanization and tool improvement have been realized.

Generally speaking, in the early stage of the technical transformation of agriculture in our country, modern and improved should be developed simultaneously, with improvement as the main focus; foreign and indigenous methods should be adopted simultaneously, with indigenous methods as the main focus. Here, we must prevent two possible deviations. One is to despise the reform of those elementary things that still have great use value at present, and even some of which will be indispensable in the future, and wait wholeheartedly for those advanced things that cannot be obtained or cannot be obtained much at present. The other is that there is a realistic possibility to equip agriculture with modern technology faster and better, but not actively strive for it. At present, more attention should be paid to the former possible deviation.

In line with the "walking on two legs" of the technical transformation of agriculture, the industrial departments should also adopt the policy of "walking on two legs" to support agriculture to realize the technical transformation as soon as possible. That is, we must rely on large-scale, foreign-method production enterprises, and also rely on small and medium-sized and indigenous-method production enterprises. Large-scale, foreign-method production enterprises are the backbone force to support agriculture to realize technical transformation, and are the main force. However, we must not only look at modern large-scale industrial enterprises. We should also pay enough attention to the local army that realizes the technical transformation of agriculture, that is, medium-sized industrial enterprises and small-scale industrial enterprises that are all over the country and use indigenous methods of production. These small and medium-sized industrial enterprises that use indigenous methods of production play an important role in the technical transformation of agriculture. Because small and medium-sized industrial enterprises are widely distributed and close to rural areas, they can better meet the specific needs of different regions. These small and medium-sized industrial enterprises that use indigenous methods of production can not only manufacture agricultural production tools and produce other means of production needed by agriculture to make up for the shortcomings of large-scale industry; but also undertake the repair tasks of agricultural machinery and other equipment. At the same time, in terms of human resources, they can be combined with local agricultural production for utilization; in terms of material resources, they can also make full use of the sporadic and scattered resources that large-scale industries cannot utilize. Especially those small and medium-sized industrial enterprises run by counties and rural people's communes are more closely integrated with agriculture, and their support for agriculture is more direct. Therefore, we should actively develop such enterprises and lead and organize them well so that they can better serve the technical transformation of agriculture.

Several Main Characteristics of Agricultural Mechanization in Our Country

In the process of realizing agricultural mechanization and carrying out technical transformation of agriculture, we must earnestly base ourselves on the actual situation in our country, summarize the experience of agricultural production and past technical reforms in our country, and at the same time, learn from the advanced experience of the world, especially the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. We must pay full attention to some of the main characteristics of realizing agricultural mechanization in our country.

First, agricultural mechanization must be suitable for the traditional intensive farming system in our country. Our country's agriculture has a good tradition of intensive farming with thousands of years of history. Since liberation, especially since the cooperative movement and the people's commune movement in rural areas, more than 500 million farmers, under the wise leadership of the Party, have given full play to their infinite wisdom and creative talents, so that the excellent tradition of intensive farming in the past has been systematically and comprehensively developed. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong attach great importance to these great creations of the peasant masses, and have timely and systematically summarized their rich experience, so that they have gradually formed the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. This is a major victory in the history of agricultural technology development, and it is a victory with great scientific significance. This is also the main way to increase agricultural production in our country. Therefore, in carrying out technical transformation of agriculture and realizing agricultural mechanization, we must take the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture as the starting point, and we must take ensuring the continued development of the excellent tradition of intensive farming as the starting point, so that the process of realizing the technical transformation of agriculture is not only to reduce the intensity of physical labor and improve labor productivity, but also to ensure the continuous improvement of yield per unit area and ensure the continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.

Second, agricultural mechanization must adapt to the complex natural conditions in our country. Our country has a vast territory, with high-cold regions and subtropical regions; mountains and hills, plains and depressions; some areas have spring all year round, and some areas have a very short frost-free period; in short, the conditions of climate, terrain, topography, soil, water sources, etc. are very different, and the varieties and farming conditions of crops are also diverse. Therefore, we must consider these situations when carrying out technical transformation and realizing agricultural mechanization. Agricultural machinery must have great diversity, including various necessary models and various performances. At the same time, the mechanization of agriculture must not only meet the needs of agricultural field labor, but also meet the needs of agricultural non-field labor.

Third, the technical transformation of agriculture is carried out under the circumstances that the people's commune movement has been universally realized in the vast rural areas of our country. The people's communes not only require the realization of agricultural mechanization, but also require the realization of mechanization in all aspects of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. In addition to mainly needing agricultural machinery, the people's communes also need other machinery suitable for diversified operations. With agricultural mechanization as the focus, while also considering the gradual realization of the mechanization of other industries. Only in this way can all the people's communes be equipped with machinery, freeing up a large amount of labor force and accelerating the socialist construction of our country. In terms of the technical transformation of agriculture, we must also make one machine as usable for multiple operations as possible, so as to achieve "one machine for multiple purposes" and be able to be used all year round, so as to achieve economy.

Fourth, our agricultural machinery manufacturing plants cannot be only large-scale, but must be a combination of large, medium, and small, and most of them should be medium and small-scale. In our large country, the number of agricultural machinery needed is very large, and the varieties are very complex, especially the existing modern agricultural machinery manufacturing capacity is still very limited. To accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization in our country, in addition to relying on modern large-scale factories, we must also rely on thousands of local and commune-run small and medium-sized factories that combine indigenous and foreign methods. In the long run, the combination of large, medium, and small will make it possible to accelerate the capacity of agricultural machinery manufacturing to meet the growing and diverse needs of rural areas in various places.

Strengthen the Leadership of the Party, Rely on the Strength of the Broad Masses, and Strive to Realize the Great Task of Technical Transformation of Agriculture!

The issue of technical transformation of agriculture is not only a technical issue, but also primarily a political issue. In our country, to realize the technical transformation of agriculture, we must not only carry out a thorough revolution in agriculture technically, but also carry out great and meticulous work on the peasants politically and ideologically and culturally, so that the appearance of rural areas in our country will be fundamentally changed. At the same time, the issue of technical transformation of agriculture is closely related to the development of industry, transportation, commerce, and cultural, educational, scientific, and technological undertakings. This is a great undertaking unprecedented in history, and it is a glorious and arduous task for the whole Party and the whole people.

Strengthening the leadership of the Party and resolutely implementing the Party's general line of going full steam ahead, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results and its entire set of policies of "walking on two legs," and fully mobilizing the broadest masses are the fundamental guarantees for realizing the great task of technical transformation of agriculture.

Strengthening the leadership of the Party is first and foremost strengthening political and ideological leadership and adhering to putting politics in command.

After the Party Central Committee put forward the call to expedite the technical transformation of agriculture, it immediately received a warm response from the broad masses of cadres and people in urban and rural areas, who expressed their determination to contribute their greatest strength to the completion of this glorious task. But this does not mean that everyone fully understands the great significance and tasks of the technical transformation of agriculture; some people still have some incorrect understandings of this issue.

Some people say that the technical transformation of agriculture is a matter for the agricultural sector and has little to do with the industrial sector. If it has anything to do with the industrial sector, it is only a matter for farm tool factories, tractor factories, and chemical fertilizer factories, and other industrial sectors can ignore it. This view is obviously incorrect. The technical transformation of agriculture certainly requires the efforts of the agricultural sector itself, but if there are only the efforts of the agricultural sector itself without the strong support of the industrial sector for the agricultural sector, the technical transformation of agriculture cannot be successfully realized. This is not only because the technical transformation of agriculture requires the industrial sector to produce mechanized farm tools, tractors, chemical fertilizers, etc., but also to produce and use these things, if there is no support from the metallurgical industry, the coal industry, the electric power industry, the petroleum industry, and other related industries, it will not work.

Some people also believe that to build socialism at a high speed, we can only concentrate our efforts to develop industry first, and after industrialization, the technical transformation of agriculture can be realized naturally. This view is also incorrect. They do not understand that developing industry and developing agriculture, realizing socialist industrialization and realizing the technical transformation of agriculture, are mutually conditional, mutually combined, and mutually promoting. We must not separate them and isolate them, and we must not only emphasize one aspect and neglect or relax the other. This is not only because the modernization of agriculture needs the support of industry, but also because, for industry itself, only by accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture can agriculture provide more and more labor and provide more and more grain and raw materials for industry. If the industrial sector only cares about its own development and does not take active steps to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture, the result will not only not guarantee the continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, but will also hinder the continued Great Leap Forward in industrial production and delay the speed of building socialism.

Still others believe that the realization of the technical transformation of agriculture requires a large amount of funds and a large number of technicians, while the rural areas are "poor and blank," which has the difficulty of insufficient funds and the difficulty of mastering technology. To solve these difficulties, we can only rely on the state. This understanding is also incorrect. Of course, the state actively supports the funds, agricultural machines, and technicians needed for the technical transformation of agriculture, but if we only rely on the state and do not mobilize the great force of the peasant masses to carry out the technical transformation of agriculture, then the result will definitely be less, slower, worse, and more expensive, and even at a loss. On the contrary, as long as the masses are mobilized, coupled with the strong support of the state, the cause of technical transformation of agriculture will develop rapidly. The Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, led by Wang Guofan, a nationally renowned labor model, is the best example. In realizing the technical transformation of agriculture at a high speed, they gave

    关于我国的农业技术改造问题
    牛中黄
    中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。
           ——毛泽东：《关于农业合作化问题》
    尽快地实现农业技术改造是我国当前一项伟大的历史任务
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，人民公社化的出现，两年来国民经济的连续大跃进，使我国社会主义建设跨入了一个新的阶段，即持续跃进的阶段。
    新阶段向我们提出了新的任务，其中一个最重要的任务，就是在加速社会主义工业化的同时，必须尽快地实现农业的技术改造，使工农业的发展更进一步地密切结合起来。这也就是党的在优先发展重工业的条件下以农业为基础，以工业为主导的工业和农业同时并举的方针，在新的阶段所赋予它的新的内容。完成这个任务，将为我国工农联盟进一步的巩固和发展创造新的物质基础；为我国社会主义建设的不断跃进开辟更广阔的天地。
    实现农业的技术改造，是社会主义建设的一个基本任务。毛泽东同志说：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。”
    实现农业的技术改造，就是要逐步地而又迅速地把我国的农业生产从主要地使用手工工具和畜力工具，改变为主要地使用机器；从主要地使用人力和畜力，改变为主要地使用机械动力和电力；把旱涝的土地，变成为无雨保收、有雨不涝的土地，并且用机器排水灌溉代替人力排水灌溉；以及从主要地使用人力加工的肥料改变为主要地使用机械制造的肥料（其中包括有机化学肥料和无机化学肥料），以便在较短的时期内，使我国的农业从目前落后的技术基础上转移到现代化大生产的技术基础上来。
    为什么现在必须把尽快地实现农业技术改造的任务突出地提出来呢？
    首先，为了进一步贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针，并使农业生产的增长，进一步适应工业生产的发展以及整个国民经济发展的要求。大家知道，从1958年大跃进以来，我国国民经济的发展，出现了一种新的可喜的趋势，这就是过去几年来农业发展速度落后于工业发展速度的状况，开始发生变化。在第一个五年计划期间，工业平均每年增长速度是18％，农业平均每年增长速度是4.5％，工业的发展速度为农业的四倍。而在大跃进的1958年，工业的增长速度是66.2％，农业的增长速度是25％，工业的发展速度为农业的二点六倍。1959年的继续大跃进，工业的增长速度是39.3％，农业的增长速度是16.7％，工业的发展速度为农业的二点三五倍。这就是说，农业正在不断地以很快的速度赶了上来。但是，我们要使农业能够继续不断地跃进，使农业和工业的发展速度进一步接近和协调起来，依靠农业现有的技术显然已经不够了。
    两年来，我国的农业虽然有了很大的跃进，但是，我国各项事业都在高速度地发展着，而农业生产现时的水平，还不能适应年年增长的商品粮食和工业原料的需要。据初步估计，要比较充分地满足全体人民对于粮食的需要，要有足够的饲料来繁殖牲畜，我国的粮食产量至少需要在现有的水平上再增长一倍以上。要比较充分地满足我国人民的衣著需要，除了积极地发展化学纤维以外，单就人民对于棉纱、棉布和絮棉的需要来说，棉花的生产，至少也需要在现有的水平上再提高两倍左右。而其他农产品和畜产品则需要有更大的增长。很明显，要满足这种需要，就必须有更高的农业劳动生产率，更高的亩产量。而要做到这一点，就必须实现农业的技术改造。
    其次，为了更加充分地发挥人民公社的优越性，使我国农业继续保持跃进的发展速度。我国农村的人民公社化，为农业的大生产，农业生产的大跃进，开辟了无限广阔的前程。正像少奇同志在《马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利》一文中指出的，它“可以容纳社会主义社会和共产主义社会中不同程度的生产力和与之相适应的不同水平的生产关系”。1958年以来，我国农业的大跃进，农村各项事业的大发展，特别是大办农田水利建设和农村大办工业、大炼钢铁的运动，这只不过是人民公社威力的初试锋芒。要更大地更充分地发挥人民公社农林牧副渔综合经营和工农商学兵全面发展的优越性，要使农业生产持续不断地跃进，就需要在生产技术方面，从目前主要使用简陋工具和依靠手工操作的落后水平，逐步地、迅速地提高到主要依靠机器操作的先进水平，这就要求完成农业的技术改造，实现农业的现代化。
    再次，我们党之所以在现在突出地提出尽快地实现农业技术改造的问题，还有一个重要的原因，就是：由于工业、农业和其他各项事业的大跃进，使得我国由一个劳动力过剩的国家一变而成为劳动力不足的国家。在我们这样六亿多人口的大国中，感到了劳动力不足，这是一件天大的好事。1958年工业的大跃进，全国职工平均人数比上一年增加几百万人，他们绝大部分来自农业，而且工业和其它各项事业的继续跃进，还要求从农业方面提供愈来愈多的劳动力。同时，农业的大跃进，在生产和建设上用的劳动力也有极大的增加。这是一个愈来愈显得尖锐的新问题。要很好地解决这个问题，一方面，必须继续从提高人民公社社员的劳动积极性、合理使用劳动力、改善劳动组织、推广先进经验、健全管理制度、巩固劳动纪律等方面继续发挥和发掘劳动力的潜力。在这些方面，我们也确实取得了显著的成效。但同时还应当看到，在广大农民目前普遍使用手工工具进行生产的条件下，这种潜力的发挥终究是有一定限度的。只有尽快地实现农业的技术改造，大大地提高劳动生产率，才是解决这个问题的根本出路。这是摆在我国人民面前的伟大历史任务。
    最后，实现农业技术改造，对进一步巩固工农联盟有十分重要的意义。大家知道，我国工人阶级领导下的工农联盟，在民主革命时期是建立在土地改革的基础上的。党领导全国人民在这个基础上取得了新民主主义革命的彻底胜利。在土地改革完成以后，我国的工农联盟又建立在农业合作化的基础上，在这个基础上，我们取得了对农业、手工业和对资本主义工商业社会主义改造的胜利。现在，我国的工农联盟已经进入了新的阶段，在这个新阶段，工农联盟不但要建立在农村人民公社化的基础上，而且要建立在农业机械化的基础上。因此，积极进行农业技术改造，就会使我国的工农联盟进一步地巩固和发展，从而取得社会主义建设的彻底的胜利。
    实现我国农业技术改造的主要内容
    实现农业技术改造的具体内容，就是要实现农业的机械化、水利化、电气化。这三个方面是相互联系、相互促进的，但其中心环节是机械化。因为在实现农业技术改造的过程中，农业机械化有着特殊重要的作用。它既要为农业生产本身服务，又要为农业的水利化、电气化服务。
    实现农业机械化，就是要逐步地、积极地把当前我国农业生产从主要地使用手工工具和畜力工具，改变为主要地使用机器。机器是提高农业劳动生产率、节省劳动的最有力的手段。根据黑龙江省的材料：使用不同的农业生产工具所创造的劳动价值和农产品的商品率是有很大不同的。以1959年为例，基本上实现了机械化的国营农场平均一个劳动力全年创造产值三千元左右，生产粮食三万斤左右，商品率占74％。已实现半机械化的农村人民公社（主要使用新式农具，同时有少数拖拉机），平均一个劳动力全年创造的产值一千二百元左右，生产粮食一万五千斤左右，商品率占60％。而使用旧式农具比重较大的农村人民公社，平均一个劳动力全年创造产值七百元左右，生产粮食八千斤左右，商品率只占40％左右。由此可见，使用机器比使用新式农具提高劳动生产率一倍，商品粮食的产量提高一点四七倍；比使用旧式农具提高劳动生产率二点七五倍，商品粮食的产量提高将近六倍。另外，根据天津市所属各县的材料，单只实现米面加工机械化，猪和牲口饲料加工机械化，缝纫、制鞋机械化和工厂化，就可以节约四十二万个劳动力，等于全市农村全部劳动力的14％。从这些事实里可以看出：只有逐步地用机械化农具、排灌机械、农村运输工具和农副产品加工工具，来代替农村普遍使用着的落后的手工工具，我国农业的劳动生产率才能得到迅速地提高，农民的体力劳动才可以减轻，并且才有可能从农业战线上抽出大量的劳动力来满足工业以及国民经济其它方面日益发展的需要。
    在目前条件下，实现农业机械化，应当从农村最费劳动力
  的地方着手；应当把机械化的重点放在劳动量大、劳动强度高、农时要求紧迫的作业和作物方面去。一般来说，农业的田
  间作业，如耕地、耙地、播种、中耕、植物保护、收获，以及农
  田排水灌溉、积肥、造肥、农村运输、农副产品加工和畜牧、造林等都是劳动量很大、劳动强度又高的。特别是田间作业、排水灌溉、积肥造肥、农村运输、农副产品加工费力更多。在推广农业增产的“八字宪法”以后，上面所说的几个方面，更迫切需要机械化。因此，首先在这些方面实现半机械化、机械化是有很大意义的。
    为了实现农业机械化，除了农村人民公社的工业积极努力以外，生产农业机械的部门，一方面要充分地发挥现有企业的生产潜力，坚决执行洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的方针，并且对现有企业逐步进行技术改造，尽可能地增产各种农业机械和改良农具，以满足农业当前的需要；另一方面，又要根据农业机械化的规划，按计划进行新企业的基本建设，扩大现代化农业机械的生产能力。经过这两方面的努力，大大提高农业机械的生产能力，以便源源不断地制造多种机器，装备农业。
    实现农田水利化，就是要把一切可能用水灌溉的土地，逐步地做到用水灌溉。做到大雨不成灾，无雨保丰收；坡地梯田化、平原河网化、沟壑川台化、工程系统化、提水机械化、山坡都绿化。从而使江河流域能抗御一定的洪水；使易涝地区能抗御一定的涝灾；使全国绝大多数耕地能抗御特大的干旱；使沟壑地区遇有暴雨，土不下坡，水不出沟；使沿海地区不发生潮水倒灌和水灾。在基本上实现水利化以后，我们将进一步迈向更伟大的征服自然的目标。我们将在全国范围内逐步地建成更加完善的全国的航运网，建成以大型水电站为中心的大电网，使大中小电站结合，使水力、火力、气力、风力等多种能源的电站结合，实现农村的电气化。
    要实现水利化，除了进一步改善现有的灌溉系统，并逐步建设新的灌溉系统以外，还要逐步地用机器来代替人力灌溉。根据现有的材料来看，一个马力的排水灌溉机器，就可以代替八个劳动力。我们现在已经有三百多万马力的排水灌溉机械，要实现排水灌溉的机械化，还需要生产更多的排水灌溉机械。
    在发展农业机械化、水利化的同时，还必须相应地解决农村的动力问题，实现农村电气化。把农业从主要地使用人力和畜力作为基本动力的状况，改变为主要地使用电力和其它机械动力。动力能源是实现农业机械化、电气化所不可缺少的条件。而在动力能源方面，我们有非常有利的条件。我国的水力资源约有五亿八千万瓩，占世界的第一位。煤炭资源也很丰富。此外，还有天然气、风力、太阳能等动力能源可资利用。我们应当充分地利用这些有利条件，全面规划，加强领导，因地制宜地积极地发展农村的水电站和火电站以及天然气站、沼气站等。特别是要结合农业的水利化，综合利用水力资源，尽量利用水的落差，大量进行中、小型水力电站和火力电站的设计，并有计划地生产小型发电设备和与之相适应的配套设备，以加速农业的电气化。
    在农业中广泛地采用化学，是农业技术改造中的一个重要方面。在这方面目前主要是积极地增加化学肥料的生产。肥料是农业增产的基本要素之一。目前我国大量、普遍采用的是自然肥料（有机肥料），化学肥料的采用量虽然逐年有所增加，但是同农业生产发展对于化学肥料的需要相比，还差得很远。
    发展化学肥料当前的一个重要问题，就是要从主要地使用人力加工肥料，改变为主要地使用机器制造肥料，其中包括无机化学肥料和有机化学肥料。据山西前洪赵县的调查：一斤机器制造的无机化学肥料能顶四十斤人工制造的杂肥、或者六十斤土粪。而目前制造和运输土粪的劳动量，却要占制造肥料和运输肥料劳动量的50％。即以一斤化学肥料顶五十斤土粪来计算，如果把目前土粪的一半，用机制无机化学肥料来代替，那么，一个拥有十五万农业劳动力的普通的县，就可以节约出一万五千个到两万个劳动力来。如果有机化学肥料也用机械加工来代替人力加工，那就可以节省更多的人力。从肥料的效果来说，一斤无机化学肥料可以增产三斤粮食或者一斤籽棉，这要比一般的土粪效果大很多倍。因此，必须以更大的力量来加快发展化学肥料工业。
    当然，我们在积极地发展无机化学肥料生产的时候，决不可以因此而忽视增产有机肥料。即使在我国能够生产很多无机化学肥料以后，有机肥料不但不可以减少，而且还应当大大增加。有机肥料也是化学肥料，较之无机肥料它能够更好地培植土壤的肥力。所以养猪、养羊、养大牲畜积肥，特别是养猪积肥，制造大量的有机化学肥料，这是任何时候都不能忽视的。一头猪一年可以积造厩肥一万斤左右，相当于一百二十斤顶好的无机化学肥料。可见，一头猪就是一个很好的小型有机化学肥料工厂。而且猪肥这种有机化学肥料，比无机化学肥料要好得多。
    我国现在已经有了实现农业技术改造的条件
    我们现在提出加速实现农业技术改造，不仅是必要的，而且也具备了一定的条件。
    我国已经建立起了社会主义工业化的基础，经过1958年和1959年连续大跃进，这个基础正在不断扩大。我们已经拥有了一系列的新的工业部门，其中也包括直接为农业技术改造服务的工业生产部门。特别是由于两年来的大跃进，工业遍地开花，在我国辽阔广大的土地上，已经建立起一个初具规模的从城市到农村人民公社的城乡工业网。许多县城、集镇、人民公社已经有了小型的农具制造厂、农具修配厂、土化肥厂、土农药厂，有的地方还根据当地的资源条件，建立起小煤窑、小炼铁厂、小炼油厂、小水泥厂、小型发电站等等。这就是说我们既有国家的大型工业，又有地方的中小型工业，特别是县、社办的工业，这就使我们在向农业现代化进军中，不但有了主力军，而且有了实力雄厚的地方军。
    我国农村实现了人民公社化，这是我国农业由使用畜力农具的小规模经营跃进到使用机器的大规模经营的另一个基本条件。人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，为农业的技术改造开辟了无限广阔的天地。人民公社规模大，活动范围广，集体化程度高，它不仅便于工、农、兵、学、商五业并举和农、林、牧、副、渔的综合经营，发展多种经济，而且便于加速农业的机械化、电气化，便于发挥农业机械的威力。
    人民公社促进了生产的大跃进，提高了农业的积累率，这也是实现农业技术改造的重要条件。大家知道，在过去个体经济的条件下，农业的积累率是非常低的，在遭受灾害的时候，不但没有什么积累，而且还要吃老本。在农业合作社时期，农业的积累率提高了，人民公社化以后增加积累的可能性更大了。1958年农村人民公社的积累达到一百亿元，比1957年农业合作社的积累增加一倍多，相当于第一个五年计划期间个体农民与农业合作社积累总和的一半以上。农业积累的增加，对于购买机器、购买化肥等生产资料的力量就大大地增强了。
    此外，在过去几年中间，许多国营农场和人民公社的生产队（原来的高级合作社）对于农业技术改造，特别是对于采用新式农具、改良农具以及实现农业的半机械化、机械化方面，做了很多试验和推广的工作，也为加速农业技术改造准备了条件。
    我国人民在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，对于农业的技术改造，表现了高度的积极性。全国各地许多工厂、矿区、部队、机关、学校，都把支援农业技术改造作为一项光荣任务，积极地投入了这个运动。许多工厂、矿区，纷纷和人民公社挂钩，千方百计地进行支援。有的直接帮助人民公社建立农具制造修配工厂；有的抽出闲置的机械设备，收集下脚废料，帮助公社；有的派出成百成千的技术工人，组成服务队深入农村，为人民公社检修机械，向农民传授操作技术；不少工厂、矿区固定了支援对象，订出规划，建立制度，一包到底。农业机械制造部门更是日夜筹划和赶制各种农业机械。人民解放军发扬了一贯积极支援地方群众运动的光荣传统，抽出大批人力物力，帮助公社生产农业机械和培养技术人材。商业部门想尽各种办法，清理仓库，大挖潜力，交换情报，沟通有无，越来越大地起着工业支援农业的后勤部的作用。许多机关、学校也利用自己一切可能的条件，在文化上、技术上给农民以热情帮助。在党的领导下，在全民的支援下，一个群众性的农业技术改造运动已经风起云涌、波澜壮阔地开展起来了。
    坚决贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针
    对农业的技术改造应当坚持贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，也就是要切实贯彻执行现代化机器和改良工具同时并举，机械化和半机械化、改良农具同时并举，洋的和土的同时并举的方针。
    根据我国现时的具体条件，党中央和毛泽东同志提出了在我国实现农业机械化，要做到“四年以内小解决、七年以内中解决、十年以内大解决”。从1959年起，在十年的时间内，我们要使农业、林业、牧业、副业和渔业各项生产、水利施工、农田灌溉、造肥积肥、农产品加工、交通运输、农村建筑等等，逐步走向机械化。但是，在头四年内，由于农业机械生产等等条件不足，着重以农业和牧业为重点，首先争取农、牧业生产小部机械化，和农田排灌基本机械化。在这四年内，要使大城市郊区、商品粮食基地、主要经济作物基地和主要的副食品生产基地首先实现初步机械化，而在全国其它的大多数地区则以推行半机械化和改良农具为主。在七年内，由于农业机械工业逐步发展，农业机器的供应将大量增加，那时就有可能在全国一半以上地区实现机械化。到了十年左右的时候，就有可能在全国范围内基本上实现机械化和相当程度的电气化。
    目前，在农业机械化方面，主要是依靠改良农具和半机械化农具。多数地区、多数农业生产部门是对现有农具、提水工具、运输工具和农副产品加工工具进行改革；同时，积极为农业机械化创造条件。在那些地多人少、交通便利、农产品商品率高的地方，应当积极地实现机械化；但是，在这些地区，同机械化相辅而行的，也需要一定的半机械化和改良工具。现在，全国广大农村正在开展着一个规模巨大的工具改革运动。工具改革从单件的改，发展到成套的改；从对耕作农具的改，发展到对农、林、牧、副、渔以及集体生活工具的全面的改；从在原有工具基础上的改良，发展到半机械化、机械化的新工具的创造。在一些地区的某些农业重要项目上已经实现半机械化和工具改良化了。
    就全国一般情况来说，在我国农业技术改造的初期，应当是现代化的和改良的同时并举，以改良为主；洋的和土的同时并举，以土为主。这里要防止两种可能发生的偏向。一种是轻视改革那些初级的、在现时还有很大使用价值、甚至有些在将来还是必不可少的东西，一心等待那些高级的、但是在现时还得不到或者得不到很多的东西。另一种是，有现实的可能性，能够更快更好地用现代技术装备农业，而不去积极争取。在目前，对于前一种可能发生的偏向更要注意。
    同农业技术改造的“两条腿走路”相适应，工业部门支援农业尽快地实现技术改造，也要采取“两条腿走路”的方针。这就是既要依靠大型的、洋法生产的企业，又要依靠中小型的和土法生产的企业。大型的、洋法生产的企业，是支援农业实现技术改造的骨干力量，是主力军。但是，决不能把眼睛只望着现代化大型工业企业。我们还应当足够地重视实现农业技术改造的地方军，这就是中型的工业企业和遍布全国的小型的、用土法生产的工业企业。这些中小型的、用土法生产的工业企业，对于农业技术改造有着重要的作用。因为中小型工业企业分布面广和接近农村，能够更好地满足不同地区的具体需要。这种中小型的、用土法生产的工业企业，不但可以制造农业生产工具和生产农业所需要的其它生产资料，以补大工业的不足；而且还可以担任农业机械和其它设备的修理任务。同时，在人力资源上，又可以和当地农业生产结合利用；在物质资源上，也可以充分利用那些大工业所不能利用的零星的分散的资源。尤其是那些县办的和农村人民公社办的中小型的、土法生产的工业企业，同农业的结合更加密切，对农业的支援也就更加直接。因此，我们应当积极地发展这种企业，并且很好地领导和组织它们，使它们更好地为农业技术改造服务。
    我国农业机械化的几个主要特点
    在实现农业机械化、进行农业技术改造过程中，我们要切实根据我国的实际情况，总结我国农业生产和过去技术改革的经验，同时，也要学习世界的首先是苏联的和其它社会主义国家的先进经验。我们要充分注意实现我国农业机械化的一些主要特点。
    第一，农业机械化要适合我国传统的精耕细作制度。我国农业有数千年历史的精耕细作的优良传统。解放以来，尤其是合作化和农村人民公社化以来，五亿多农民在党的英明领导下，发挥了他们的无穷的智慧和创造才能，使得过去精耕细作的优良传统得到了系统的全面的发展。党中央和毛泽东同志极端重视农民群众的这些巨大创造，及时地系统地总结了他们的丰富经验，使之逐步形成为农业“八字宪法”。这是农业技术发展史上的重大胜利，是具有巨大科学意义的胜利。这也是我国农业增产的主要途径。因此，我们在进行农业技术改造、实现农业机械化中，必须以贯彻农业“八字宪法”为出发点，必须以保证继续发扬精耕细作的优良传统为出发点，使实现农业技术改造的过程，不只是减轻体力劳动强度，提高劳动生产率，而且能保证单位面积产量的不断地提高，保证农业生产的持续跃进。
    第二，农业机械化必须适应我国复杂的自然条件。我国幅员广阔，有高寒地区，有亚热带地区；有山区、丘陵，有平原、洼地；有的地区四季如春，有的地区无霜期很短；总之，气候、地形、地势、土壤、水源等等条件千差万异，而农作物的品种和耕作条件也是多种多样。因此，我们进行技术改造，实现农业机械化时要考虑到这些情况，农业机械必须具有极大的多样性，包括各种必要的型号，各种性能。同时农业的机械化，既要满足农业田间劳动的需要，又要满足农业非田间劳动的需要。
    第三，进行农业技术改造是在我国广大农村已经普遍实现了人民公社化的情况下进行的。人民公社不仅要求实现农业机械化，而且在林、牧、副、渔各方面也要求实现机械化。人民公社除了主要需要农业机械外，还需要适用于多种经营的其他机械。以农业机械化为重点，又考虑到逐步实现其他各业的机械化。这样才能把人民公社全部用机械装备起来，解放出大量劳动力，加速我国的社会主义建设。在农业技术改造方面，我们还要尽可能使一种机械能够用于多项作业，做到“一机多用”，能够常年使用，做到经济。
    第四，我们的农业机械制造厂，也不能只是大型的，必须是大中小相结合，多数应当是中型的和小型的。在我们这样一个大国，需要农业机械的数量很大，品种又十分复杂，特别是现有的现代化的农业机械制造能力还很有限，要加速实现我国的农业机械化，除了依靠现代化大工厂外，还必须依靠成千上万的地方和社办的中小型的、土洋结合的工厂。从长远来说，大中小相结合，就有可能加速农业机械制造的能力，以满足各地农村不断增长的多种多样的需要。
    加强党的领导，依靠广大群众的力量，
    为实现农业技术改造的伟大任务而奋斗！
    农业技术改造的问题，不止是一个技术问题，而且首先是一个政治问题。在我国，实现农业技术改造，不但要在技术上对农业进行彻底的革命，而且要从政治思想上、文化上对农民进行巨大而细致的工作，使我国农村的面貌根本改观。同时，农业技术改造的问题，同工业、交通运输业、商业以及文教科学技术事业等各方面的发展，都有密切的关系。这是前无古人的伟大事业，是全党全民的光荣而艰巨的任务。
    加强党的领导，坚决贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线及其一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，把最广大的群众充分发动起来，这是实现农业技术改造这个伟大任务的根本保证。
    加强党的领导，首先就是加强政治思想领导，坚持政治挂帅。
    党中央提出尽快地实现农业技术改造的号召以后，马上得到了城乡广大干部和人民群众的热烈响应，纷纷表示决心，一定要为完成这个光荣的任务而贡献出自己最大的力量。但这并能说，每个人对农业技术改造的重大意义和任务都完全了解了；有些人对这一问题还存在一些不正确的认识。
    有人说，农业的技术改造是农业部门的事情，和工业部门关系不大，如果说和工业部门有什么关系的话，这也只不过是农具工厂、拖拉机工厂、化肥工厂的事情，至于其它工业部门可以不管。这种看法，显然是不正确的。农业的技术改造，当然需要农业部门本身的努力，但是，如果只有农业部门本身的努力，而没有工业部门对农业部门的强有力的支援，农业的技术改造是不可能胜利实现的。这不仅因为农业的技术改造，需要工业部门生产机械化农具、拖拉机、化学肥料等等，而且要生产和使用这些东西，如果没有冶金工业、煤炭工业、电力工业、石油工业以及其他有关工业的支援也是不行的。
    也有人认为，要高速度建设社会主义，只能先集中力量发展工业，等到工业化以后，农业的技术改造就可以自然而然地实现。这种观点，也是不正确的。他们不懂得，发展工业和发展农业，实现社会主义工业化和实现农业技术改造，是互为条件、互相结合、互相促进的。决不应当把它们分割开来和孤立起来，决不可以只强调一面，忽视或者放松另一面。这不仅因为农业的现代化需要工业来支援，就工业本身来说，也只有加速农业的技术改造，才能使农业给工业提供越来越多的劳动力，提供越来越多的粮食和原料。如果工业部门只顾本身的发展，而不采取积极的步骤加速农业技术改造，其结果不但不能保证农业生产的持续跃进，同时也会阻碍工业生产的继续跃进，延缓建设社会主义的速度。
    还有人认为，实现农业技术改造，需要大量的资金，大量的技术人员，而农村“一穷二白”，既有资金不足的困难，又有掌握技术的困难，要解决这些困难，只能依靠国家。这种认识，也是不正确的。当然，国家对于农业技术改造所需要的资金、农业机器和技术人员，都是积极支援的，但是，如果只靠国家，而不发动农民群众这个伟大的力量来进行农业的技术改造，那么，结果一定是少慢差费，甚至一筹莫展。相反地，只要发动了群众，加上国家的有力的支援，农业技术改造的事业就会一日千里地向前发展。全国著名的劳动模范王国藩领导的河北省遵化县建明人民公社就是一个最好的例证。他们在高速度实现农业技术改造中，充分发挥了群众的积极性和创造性，发扬了勤俭办社的光荣传统，贯彻了自力更生的精神。在1959年一年中，他们就用公社的公共积累，购买了五台拖拉机、十一台农业机具、十六台动力机械、五台发电机。1959年春天，他们发动社员每人打柴二百斤，卖了三万元，买了两辆汽车。
    1960年，国家计划供应他们价值三百五十万元的农业机械和电气设备，这个公社采取了增加公共积累、扩大多种经营和发动社员投资等办法，很快地筹集了一大批资金。他们提出“苦干一年，还清国家垫款”的口号。当公社有了拖拉机、锅驼机和汽车等现代化农业技术设备，而公社里缺乏技术人材的时候，公社党委就举办业余技术学校和训练班，采取“请进来拜师傅，派出去当徒弟”等办法，让社员学习和掌握机械操作技术；并且以业余学校为基地建立研究小组，培养生产领导干部、劳动模范和专业技术人员。这样，在很短的时间里，就训练出二百多名拖拉机手、汽车司机和电工等技术人材。这个例子生动地证明，资金不足的困难和掌握技术的困难，人民公社是有办法解决的。况且，农村人民公社普遍都有社办工业，社办工业的主要任务是为农业生产服务，为农业技术改造服务。它是我国实现农业技术改造分布最广、数量最多的一支地方军。只要坚持勤俭办事、自力更生的方针，贯彻因地制宜，因陋就简，土洋结合，以土为主的原则，反对贪大贪洋，轻土轻小的思想，它就能在农业技术改造中发挥很大的作用，制造各种各样机械化的半机械化的或者改良的农具，以及土化肥、土农药。这就不仅能为人民公社节约大量的资金，而且它还可以积累资金，以及协助人民公社培养农业技术改造的各种技术人材。
    实现社会主义工业化和农业技术改造，是一个统一的过程。它们之间的关系，根本不同于资本主义的工业化和农业现代化之间的关系。在资本主义制度下，工业和农业对立，城市和乡村对立。资本家为了追求高额利润，在一定规模、一定程度上进行的农业的技术改造，是建立在广大劳动农民破产和失业的基础上的。因为只有这样做，才能造成一支广大的失业后备军，而便于资产阶级敲骨吸髓地进行剥削。社会主义工业化的过程，则是进一步发挥工业生产和农业生产内部联系的巨大作用，使工业和农业更加接近，工人和农民更加接近，城市和乡村更加接近的过程。因此，社会主义工业化的过程，必然是不断地用新的技术来武装农业、发展农业生产力的过程。社会主义制度固然不能建立在一方面是社会主义公有制，另一方面是个体经济私有制这样两个不同的基础上，而且也不能够听任工业的现代化生产和农业的手工劳动长期并存。现在，我国社会主义建设已经进入了一个新阶段。在整个国民经济的全面发展中，要求农业以更快的步伐向前发展，与工业的发展相适应。要保证工业和农业的持久的互相适应，只有逐步使工业和农业建立在同一的现代化的生产技术基础上才能达到。
    毛泽东同志在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一篇文章的按语中，称赞了上述建明人民公社的前身王国藩合作社的穷棒子精神以后说：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”的确，在农业技术改造的伟大事业中，我们既有马克思列宁主义党的领导，又有掌握了自己命运的觉悟了的广大群众，因此，不管资金困难，技术困难，以及其他任何困难，一定可以克服。怀疑这一点是没有任何根据的。
    在农业技术改造问题上的斗争，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期两条道路、两条路线、两种方法的斗争的反映。这种斗争是波澜起伏的、不断地发展的。只要坚持党的总路线，不断克服各种错误思想，就能保证农业技术改造的胜利进行。这样，就能使我国的工业和农业获得共同的高涨，使我国工农联盟在工农业现代化生产的物质技术基础上更加巩固和发展，直至最后消除城乡差别和工农差别，实现共产主义的伟大理想。
