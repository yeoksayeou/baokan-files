Everywhere There Are Kingdom Fans

Gu Ming

In Shashi, Hubei, there has emerged a Kingdom Fan on the industrial front – Qiu Yulong. He possesses the spirit of the "poor stick," not only daring to think and act but also acting skillfully and solidly. He and his two companions not only have the desire to reach the sky in one step but also have step-by-step measures to do so. They truly despise the enemy strategically and take the enemy seriously tactically.

Qiu Yulong and his two fellow shoe-making workers, relying on the excellent qualities of a Communist Party member and the self-reliance of the broad masses, overcame numerous difficulties, developing from a rubber repair group with a hammer and two knives into a factory with thirty-two machines (all but one of which were self-made) capable of producing thirty-four kinds of products.

They displayed the spirit of the "poor stick," starting from scratch and relying on their own efforts, which is precisely the true color of Kingdom Fans on the industrial front.

The spirit of the "poor stick" can include two aspects. On the one hand, emancipating the mind, daring to think and act; on the other hand, being realistic and engaging in hard struggle. It is not enough to be simply enthusiastic and daring to think and act; one must also work solidly, bit by bit, and meticulously. Every step forward for Qiu Yulong and his team always met with many obstacles, but they failed, experimented again, failed again, and experimented again. No difficulty could scare them. Qiu Yulong believed that transmission belts were man-made, and if others could make them, they certainly could too. So they made the transmission belt. Qiu Yulong put it well: "Those who fear difficulties are often surrounded by difficulties; as long as the determination is great, they will jump out of the circle of difficulties." They humbly learned from everyone with a skill at all times, studied diligently day and night, and worked hard, doing first and talking later. If they didn't have machines, they made them themselves through self-reliance. He believed that if they could make a transmission belt, they should also be able to make a machine, which was a very brave idea. Sure enough, by adopting foreign principles and using poor and indigenous methods, through hard work, they finally made the factory's first machine.

Engaging in socialist construction requires not only enthusiasm, but also a thorough and meticulous working style. Without solving difficulties one by one, without concentrating efforts, and without fighting battles of annihilation, it will not work. Fortresses must be captured one by one. Construction battles must also be fought one by one. After Qiu Yulong achieved a victory, he always said, "The road is still long, and we have only taken a small step." See how modest he is and how full of the progressive spirit of continuous revolution.

Such enterprises run by a hammer and two knives like Qiu Yulong's are not isolated cases in our country. In Shanghai, there is the Shanghai Zhichengxing Steel Products Factory, which used a pair of pliers to carry out technical revolution; in Chongqing, there is the Yangtze Fiber Textile Factory, which used two tiger-head pliers to carry out technical revolution; in Xi'an, there is the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory, which started with one furnace; and similar things are countless throughout the country. This shows that the spirit of the "poor stick" of Kingdom Fans exists in our industrial front and in all walks of life. Don't be afraid of a poor foundation; as long as we have lofty ambitions, even if people are poor, their aspirations are not poor, we can make anything and accomplish anything. By working like Kingdom Fan and Qiu Yulong, recognizing difficulties, facing difficulties squarely, tackling difficulties head-on, starting from scratch, and relying on our own efforts, this spirit of the "poor stick" reflects the fighting spirit and high morale of the broad masses of our people. May we have more Kingdom Fans on the agricultural front, Kingdom Fans on the industrial front, and Kingdom Fans in each industry and profession. Let the spirit of the "poor stick" shine brightly in every corner of our motherland and run all kinds of undertakings well!

    到处都有王国藩
    顾明
    湖北沙市出现了一个工业战线上的王国藩——丘玉龙。他具有穷棒子精神，不仅敢想敢干，并且干得巧妙，干得扎实。他和两位同伴既有一步登天的愿望，更有步步登天的措施。真是在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人。
    丘玉龙等三位制鞋工人，凭着共产党员的优秀品质，依靠广大群众自力更生，克服重重困难，从用一把榔头、两把刀的橡胶修配组，发展成拥有三十二台机器（其中除了一台是买的，别的全是自己造的），能够生产三十四种产品的工厂。
    他们发挥了穷棒子精神，白手起家，自力更生，这正是工业战线上的王国藩的本色。
    穷棒子精神，可以包括两个方面。一方面，解放思想，敢想敢干；另一方面，实事求是，艰苦奋斗。如果光是满腔热情敢想敢干还是不够的；还必须扎扎实实地干，一点一滴地干，深入细致地干。丘玉龙他们每前进一步总是遇到许多拦路虎，可是他们失败了，再试验，又失败了，又再试验。再大的困难也没有吓倒他们。丘玉龙认为传动带是人造出来的，别人能造出来，他们也一定能造出来。他们也就造成了传动带。丘玉龙说得好：“怕困难的人，往往要给困难包围；只要决心大，就会跳出困难的圈子。”他们时时刻刻虚心向一切有一技之长的人学习，一天到晚地苦心钻研，埋头苦干，干了再说。没有机器他们就自力更生地自己制造。他认为试得成传动带，也应该造得成机器，这是多末勇敢的想法。果然由于他们采用洋原理，用穷办法、土办法，经过辛勤努力，终于制成了厂里的第一台机器。
    搞社会主义建设，没有干劲不行，可光凭干劲，而缺少深入细致的工作作风，不去一个个地解决困难，不会集中力量，打歼灭战也不行。堡垒得一个一个去夺取。建设的仗也要一个一个地打。丘玉龙当取得了一个胜利之后，总是说：“路子还远着哩，只走了一小步。”你看他是多末谦虚，又是多末富于不断革命的进取精神。
    像丘玉龙这样一把榔头、两把刀办企业的事，在我们国家里并不是个别的。在上海就有一把钳子闹技术革命的上海志成兴钢铁制品厂，在重庆就有两把虎头钳闹技术革命的长江纤维纺织厂，在西安就有一个炉子起家的西安人民搪磁厂，在全国各地类似的事情真是数不胜数。这说明王国藩的穷棒子精神，在我国工业战线以及各行各业中都是存在的。不怕家底穷，只要有雄心壮志，人穷志不穷，我们就什么东西都能做出来，什么事情都能办得到。照王国藩、丘玉龙那样干，认识困难，正视困难，见困难就上，白手起家，自力更生。他们这种穷棒子精神，正反映了我国广大人民群众斗志昂扬、群情奋发的精神面貌。愿我们有更多的农业战线上的王国藩、工业战线上的王国藩，以及各行各业自己本行业的王国藩。让穷棒子精神在我们祖国的每个角落大放光芒，办好各种事业！
