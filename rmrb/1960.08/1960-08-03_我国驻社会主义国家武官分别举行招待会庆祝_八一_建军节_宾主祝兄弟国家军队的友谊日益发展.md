Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 1st: Military Attaché of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, Major General Pan Zhenwu, held a reception in Moscow on the evening of August 1st to celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Invited to attend the reception were: Soviet Marshals Bagramyan, Rokossovsky, and Chuikov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union Pushkin, as well as marshals, generals, and officers of various branches of the Soviet armed forces. Military attaches from many countries stationed in the Soviet Union were also invited to attend the reception.

Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, Zhang Yingwu, also attended the reception.

Pan Zhenwu gave a speech at the reception.

He said that the Chinese people love peace and have always adhered to a peaceful foreign policy, advocating peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and have made unremitting efforts to ease international tensions. The Chinese people have consistently given full support to the Soviet government and the Soviet people's struggle against the military provocations of U.S. imperialism, against the crimes of U.S. imperialism in undermining the Four-Power Summit, to the various disarmament proposals of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and to the Soviet Union's condemnation of the U.S. imperialism's righteous actions in undermining the Ten-Nation Disarmament Conference. He said that we love peace, but we cannot fail to see that while we are actively safeguarding world peace, U.S. imperialism is actively engaged in expanding its armaments and preparing for war. We must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and wage a resolute struggle against them.

Pan Zhenwu then spoke about the friendship and unity between the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Soviet Army. He said that the Soviet Army has made significant contributions to the cause of defending world peace. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has always adhered to the policy of learning from the Soviet Army, and the Chinese people will never forget the fraternal assistance of the Soviet people.

Next, Soviet Marshal Bagramyan spoke at the reception. He first warmly congratulated the Chinese People's Liberation Army on its 33rd anniversary. He said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has experienced a difficult and glorious road in the past thirty-three years. It has waged arduous struggles against domestic and foreign reactionaries, including U.S. imperialism, and finally achieved a brilliant victory in 1949.

Marshal Bagramyan said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, has grown into a powerful army, and it is now further improving its combat technology.

Bagramyan pointed out that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army closely linked to the people and cannot be defeated. It has close ties with the armies of socialist countries, especially with the Soviet Army.

In his speech, Zhang Leting condemned the U.S. imperialists for stepping up war preparations, creating tensions, and engaging in frantic provocations in Taiwan and South Korea. He pointed out that this clearly shows that the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism has not changed, and the danger of it launching a war of aggression still exists.

In his speech at the meeting, Kim Chang-bong first extended warm congratulations to the Chinese People's Liberation Army on behalf of the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army. He condemned the U.S. imperialists for undermining the armistice agreement in South Korea, creating provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait, and intensifying tensions and preparing for a new war in various parts of the world. He pointed out that this further exposes U.S. imperialism as the most ferocious enemy of peace and the people of the world.

General Kim Chang-bong emphasized that we will further strengthen the fighting friendship and unity with the armies of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and will forever advance together with them in the struggle against imperialism and in the cause of fighting for socialism and communism.

Senior Colonel Xing Rongjie pointed out that U.S. imperialism has demonstrated through numerous facts of its various acts of aggression that it is not only the mortal enemy of the people of China and Vietnam but also the number one enemy of the people of all socialist countries and the people of the world. He said that the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army are determined to fight against all provocations and conspiracies of U.S. imperialism.

In his speech, Nguyen Chi Thanh said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in its thirty-three years of fighting and work, has not only contributed to the victory of the Chinese revolution but also made significant contributions to the common struggle of the Asian nations.

At the cocktail party, Jiang Yizhen, the military attaché of our country in Poland, proposed a toast to the friendship between the peoples of China and Poland and between the armies of China and Poland, and to the health of the Polish Minister of National Defense, General Spechalski.

Subsequently, General Spechalski spoke at the cocktail party. He first extended his heartfelt festive congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Polish People's Army and in his personal name. He went on to say that the friendship between the Polish People's Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as the armies of other socialist countries, especially the friendship with the Soviet army, the primary force of the socialist camp, the strength and unity of the socialist camp, is the guarantee for crushing imperialist provocations.

He continued, "We highly value the fighting friendship between the Polish People's Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We highly value the efforts made by the Chinese People's Liberation Army to free the Chinese people from imperialist oppression."

He said that the main task of our army is to defend peace and the achievements of socialist construction.

Military Attaché Xu Chongjiu said at the reception that imperialism, headed by the United States, has not abandoned its policies of war and aggression. Therefore, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will join all peace-loving people around the world in raising vigilance and preparing to completely crush the aggressors' attacks when imperialism dares to launch a war.

Those attending the reception given by Song Denghua, Military Attaché of the Chinese Embassy in the German Democratic Republic, included: Minister of National Defense of the German Democratic Republic General Hoffmann, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Schwab, Deputy Minister of National Defense and Minister of Training Major General Wagner, and senior generals of the German Democratic Republic's People's Army.

Minister of National Defense of the German Democratic Republic General Hoffmann said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has achieved great achievements and gained great experience under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. He said: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is now stronger and more combat-effective than ever before, and it guards the eastern border of the socialist camp against the imperialist bandits who threaten world peace."

General Hoffmann said that the imperialists are trying to realize their plans for world hegemony by all means, but this is no longer possible.

Hoffmann pointed out that one of the main disruptors of world peace is West German militarism. It is blatantly preparing for an aggressive war against the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries using atomic weapons. He said that the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic has established an unbreakable fighting friendship with the armies of all socialist countries, which is an impregnable fortress for all aggressors.

Hoffmann said that whether it is against West German militarism led by the most aggressive force of U.S. imperialism or against Japanese imperialism, the combatants of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic and the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army are united in the common task of defending the socialist camp's borders from encroachment on the Elbe and the Yellow Sea.
