　　Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 3rd. Albanian labor activists in Tirana, the capital, gathered to welcome the Party's Fourth Congress. The congress sent a letter to the Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers, putting forward new guarantees. The letter said: In the first six months of the final year of the Second Five-Year Plan, workers in Tirana, the capital, have made remarkable achievements in production. In industry, they completed 100.6% of the guaranteed figures, overproducing products worth 860 million leks, and completed 103.5% of the plan in improving labor productivity, with the export plan completed at 105%.
　　In order to welcome the Party's Fourth Congress to be held in November this year, they have proposed new guarantees for the 1960 plan: in industry, the original guarantee of over-producing 132 million leks has been raised to 225 million leks; in terms of cost reduction, they guarantee to save an additional 21 million leks for the country; in terms of promoting advanced experience, by the end of June, 293 teams with 2,715 people had participated in the movement to strive for the title of Socialist Labor Team, and in the second half of the year, it will be guaranteed that 360 teams with 3,600 people will participate in this movement. The "One Plus Two" movement (Editor's Note: The "One Plus Two" movement means that a skilled technician is responsible for training two apprentices without remuneration.) has expanded from 5,190 people to 6,300 people by the end of June. Originally, it was guaranteed that 92% of drivers would participate in the movement of 100,000 to 600,000 kilometers without major repairs, but now it is guaranteed that 95% of drivers will participate in this movement, and it will be guaranteed to carry out one million hours of voluntary labor.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd. According to TASS reports: Currently, forty powerful thermal power stations and some giant hydropower stations are being accelerated in construction throughout the Soviet Union, and more than sixty large thermal power stations are being renovated.
　　The electric power industry is one of the fastest-growing industrial sectors in the Soviet Union (last year, the country's total power generation increased to 132 times that of 1913). Currently, its development is being further accelerated. According to the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965), the Soviet electric power industry's seven-year production plan and construction plan will be completed ahead of schedule.
　　The accelerated development of the Soviet electric power industry will be mainly achieved through giving priority to the construction of thermal power stations, while building hydropower stations with strong power generation capabilities, and shortening the construction period of power stations as much as possible. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that 211 large thermal power stations will be built throughout the country before 1965. In terms of hydropower station construction, the Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk hydropower stations (both in Siberia), which are currently under intense construction, have a power generation capacity that is one and a half times larger than the total power generation capacity of all power stations in Australia today.
　　Due to the accelerated construction speed of power stations, it is estimated that between 1963 and 1965, the speed of increasing new power generation capacity in the Soviet Union can be approximately doubled compared to now. Therefore, by 1965, the total power generation capacity of power stations throughout the Soviet Union will not be the original 113 million kilowatts stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan, but 121 million kilowatts.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 2nd. Poland, whose annual power generation was only 3.9 billion kilowatt-hours before liberation, will produce 29 billion kilowatt-hours this year, and will produce 45.5 billion kilowatt-hours by 1965.
　　In the sixteen years since liberation, Poland's electric power industry has developed rapidly. Last year, Poland's per capita power generation has increased to approximately 8.5 times that of the pre-war level.
　　In order to ensure the rapid development of the electric power industry, a series of huge power stations are being built and expanded throughout Poland. For example, the Turów thermal power station, which is being built in Lower Silesia, will install seven 200,000-kilowatt combined units, meaning that the total power generation capacity of this power station (1.4 million kilowatts) will be greater than the total power generation capacity of Poland before the war.
　　Due to the rapid development of the electric power industry, the task of nationwide electrification is being successfully realized. In 1938 before liberation, electrified rural households only accounted for 3% of the total rural households, but now they account for more than half. Between 1961 and 1965, 75% to 80% of Poland's rural areas will be electrified.

    阿工人提出生产新保证迎接党代表大会
    苏联波兰加速建设发电站　保证电力工业的发展
    本报讯　阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那的劳动党积极分子集会迎接党第四次代表大会。大会致函党中央和部长会议，提出了新的保证，信中说：首都地拉那工人在第二个五年计划最后一年的前六个月中，生产成就显著。在工业方面，完成了保证数字的100.6％，超额生产了八亿六千万里克价值的产品，在提高劳动生产率方面完成了计划的103.5％，出口计划完成了105％。
    为了迎接将在今年11月举行的党第四次代表大会，他们对1960年的计划又提出了新的保证：工业方面由原来保证超额生产一亿三千二百万里克提高到二亿二千五百万里克，在降低成本方面，保证再多为国家节约二千一百万里克，在推广先进经验方面，到6月底已有二百九十三个工作队的二千七百一十五人参加争取社会主义劳动队称号的运动，下半年将保证有三百六十个工作队的三千六百人参加这一运动。“一加二”运动（编者注：“一加二”运动的意思是一个熟练的技术工人不计报酬地负责培养两个徒弟。）至6月底已由五千一百九十人扩展到六千三百人。原来保证92％的司机参加十万至六十万公里不大修的运动，而现在保证将有95％的司机参加这一运动，并将保证进行一百万小时的义务劳动。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社报道：目前，苏联全国各地正在加速建设四十个发电能力强大的火力发电站和一些巨型水力发电站，并正在改建六十多个大型火力发电站。
    电力工业是苏联发展最快的工业部门之一（去年，全国的电力总产量已增加为1913年的一百三十二倍）。目前，它的发展又在进一步加快。根据七年计划（1959年—1965年）的执行情况，苏联电力工业的七年生产计划和建设计划都将提前完成。
    苏联电力工业的加快发展，主要将通过优先建设火力发电站，同时建设发电能力强大的水力发电站，以及尽可能缩短电站建设期限的途径来实现。七年计划规定，在1965年以前全国就将建设二百一十一个大的火力发电站。在水电站建设方面，目前正在紧张施工的布拉次克和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克两个水电站（都在西伯利亚）的发电能力，比澳大利亚洲目前所有的全部发电站的发电能力的总和大一倍半。
    由于电站建设速度加快，据预计，还在1963年至1965年期间，苏联新发电能力增加的速度就可以比现在大约加快一倍。因此，到1965年，苏联全国发电站的总发电能力将不是七年计划原订的一万一千三百万瓩而将是一万二千一百万瓩。
    新华社华沙2日电　解放前电力年产量只有三十九亿多度的波兰，今年将生产二百九十亿度电，而到1965年将生产四百五十五亿度电。
    在解放以后的十六年中，波兰的电力工业发展很快。去年波兰按人口平均的发电量已大约增为战前的八点五倍。
    为了保证电力工业迅速的发展，波兰全国正在兴建和扩建一系列巨大的发电站。例如正在下西里西亚地方兴建的图鲁夫火力发电站，它将安装七部各为二十万瓩的联动机，也就是说这个发电站的全部发电能力（一百四十万瓩）将比战前波兰全国发电能力的总和还大。
    由于电力工业的迅速发展，全国电气化的任务正在胜利实现。在解放前的1938年，全国电气化的农户只占总农户的3％，而现在已经占一半以上。在1961—1965年间，波兰的75％到80％的农村将要实现电气化。
