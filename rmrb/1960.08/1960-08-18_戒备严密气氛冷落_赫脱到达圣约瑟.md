Xinhua News Agency, San José, August 17th: U.S. Secretary of State Herter arrived in San José, the capital of Costa Rica, by plane yesterday morning under heavy guard to participate in the Organization of American States foreign ministers' conference instigated by the United States to further interfere in Cuba.

Herter arrived one day later than scheduled. This was because he feared that arriving on August 15th—a holiday for the people of Costa Rica—he might encounter mass demonstrations held to oppose the policies of U.S. imperialism.

Nevertheless, on the day of Herter's delayed arrival, armed police heavily guarded the airport and the roads leading to the city. In addition, two helicopters were on standby, ready to airlift Herter should the need arise.

Only a sparse crowd of about a hundred people awaited Herter at the airport, many of whom, as the Associated Press admitted, were journalists. This contrasted sharply with the enthusiastic welcome Cuban Foreign Minister Roa received from the crowd upon his arrival on the 14th.

    戒备严密气氛冷落
    赫脱到达圣约瑟
    据新华社17日讯　圣约瑟消息：美国国务卿赫脱昨天早晨在严密防卫下乘飞机到达哥斯达黎加的首都圣约瑟，参加美国为进一步干涉古巴而策动召开的美洲国家组织外长会议。
    赫脱比预定时间迟一天到达。这是由于他害怕在8月15日——哥斯达黎加人民的假日——到达可能会遭遇到为反对美帝国主义政策而举行的群众示威。
    尽管如此，在赫脱推迟到达的这一天，在机场和通向城区的道路上有武装警察严密警卫着。此外，有两架直升飞机待命出动，准备一有需要就让赫脱登上直升飞机。
    在机场等候赫脱的只有冷清清的一百人左右，美联社消息承认，其中不少还是新闻记者，这种情况和古巴外长罗亚14日到达时受到大声欢呼的群众欢迎的情况成了对比。
