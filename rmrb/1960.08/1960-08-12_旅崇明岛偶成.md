    Occasional Poem on a Journey to Chongming Island
    Wei Wenbo
    First Poem
    Sailing westwards, mooring at Yingzhou Isle,
    Green villages and fields meticulously tilled;
    The scent of wheat from the threshing ground travels far and wide,
    Joyful songs of the commune speak of a bountiful harvest.
    Second Poem
    Land reclamation accomplished promptly,
    Endless green rice fields, smooth as a mirror;
    Rivers and canals stretching horizontally and vertically without end,
    The pleasant scenery evokes even deeper feelings.

    旅崇明岛偶成
    魏文伯
    其一
    航行西上泊瀛洲，
    村野青青田亩修；
    场上麦香千里外，
    欢歌公社话丰收。
    其二
    拓荒事业即时成，
    无际绿禾镜样平；
    横纵河流行不尽，
    宜人风物更生情。
