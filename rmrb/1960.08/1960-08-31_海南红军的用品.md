    Supplies of the Hainan Red Army
    From 1927 to 1931, the Party organized two major armed uprisings in the Hainan Island area of Guangdong Province, established the Red Army and revolutionary regime, and persisted in a protracted guerrilla war.
    During the difficult revolutionary years, the Hainan Red Army faced extreme material shortages and often ate wild vegetables to satisfy their hunger, let alone medical equipment and drug supplies. However, the red medical and health personnel, in the face of serious difficulties, worked hard and set up red hospitals empty-handed, treating the wounded and sick for the Red Army soldiers, and ensuring the health of the revolutionary soldiers.
    They boiled the leaves of the Lousi tree and used them as gauze, rolled up banana tree bark as bandages, made boiling water tubes out of bamboo, broke open coconut shells for bowls, strung up sea buckthorn fruits as lamps, and the mountains and plains full of medicinal materials were their medicine庫. They made flutes and walking sticks out of tear-stained bamboo, which the wounded could both lean on and play. (Xiāo Bó)

    海南红军的用品
    1927年至1931年间，党在广东省海南岛地区曾组织了两次较大的武装起义，建立了红军和革命政权，坚持了长期的游击战争。
    海南红军在艰苦的革命岁月里，物资极端缺乏，常吃野菜充饥，当然更谈不到什么医疗器材和药品供应了。可是红色医务卫生人员，在严重的困难面前，发愤图强，赤手空拳地办起了红色医院，为红军战士医伤治病，保证了革命战士的健康。
    他们把篓毛叶煮过当纱布用，芭蕉树皮卷起来当绷带，竹子做成了开水筒，椰子壳破开当碗用，海棠果串起来当灯点，满山遍野的药材就是他们的药库。他们用泪斑竹做成了笛箫、手杖，伤员们既可扶又可吹奏。　（萧伯）
