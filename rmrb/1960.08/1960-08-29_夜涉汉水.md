    Night Crossing of the Han River
    Zhang Huanmei

    One freezing winter evening, the Red Fourth Front Army crossed the Qinling Mountains and arrived at the banks of the Han River on the Hanzhong Plain. The river was two or three *li* wide. In the dim evening light, one could barely make out the undulating opposite bank. The shallows were already covered with sparkling ice, like countless sharp knives floating on the surface. In the middle, the current was rapid, the waves roaring and churning like wild beasts, surging downstream one after another.

    The soldiers of the unit, wearing thin clothing, paced back and forth on the riverbank against the whistling north wind, extremely anxious and burning with impatience. To advance, with few boats and no bridges, how could bodies, worn out by four months of continuous marching and fighting, enduring hunger and deprivation, cross this icy and wide torrent? To stop, the Hu Zongnan troops following behind would catch up. Fighting with our backs to the river would be very disadvantageous for us. Although the comrades were silent, they were all thinking about the same question in their hearts: "What to do?"

    "We might as well stop here and fight the enemy! We have guns in our hands, not fire pokers..." A burst of impatient voices came from the darkness.

    "Don't worry, the commander-in-chief has gone ahead to scout for crossing points. Can this river really stop the Red Army!" Who was it that was slowly and softly comforting everyone?

    Crossing the river, easier said than done! The cold wind, sharp ice, and raging waves were before everyone, making one feel nine parts cold before even entering the water.

    Just as everyone was feeling depressed, a familiar, tall, and thin figure appeared before us. He cupped his hand to his mouth to block the wind and said loudly: "Comrades, the scouts have ridden back and forth several times. This is the only place that can be waded across." It was the voice of Commander-in-Chief Xu Xiangqian! It seemed he had just returned from the riverbank. The crowd instantly fell silent, waiting for the leader's instructions.

    Commander-in-Chief Xu asked in a consultative tone: "What do you think we should do, comrades?"
    "Cross over!" Many people answered in unison.

    "That's right, cross. We'll cross over right now and leave the enemy behind. Communists, follow me!"

    Commander-in-Chief Xu took the lead and jumped into the river. The thin ice along the bank crunched and cracked under his feet. As he walked, he turned his head and shouted: "Heroes, let's have a river-crossing race!" As soon as he finished speaking, the comrades began their intense preparations for crossing the river. Some took off their clothes, others bandaged their wounds, and then walked down to the riverbank.

    At that time, I was a nurse at the Eleventh Division Hospital, and I was marching with a few young comrades carrying a wounded soldier. We checked the stretcher to make sure it was sturdy and tied it with rope. After comforting the wounded soldier, we put the stretcher on our heads and walked into the water. As soon as our feet touched the water, they were cut by the ice, causing a piercing pain, and we didn't know if it was pain or cold.

    The sky was covered with dark clouds, and the moon was also obscured. The river surface was pitch black. Here, only countless half-submerged black figures could be seen struggling and swaying on the water's surface; only the howling of the cold wind and the sound of rushing water could be heard. Many black figures fell into the water, but silently emerged from a few meters downstream, continuing to fight the rolling Han River.

    We young comrades carrying the stretcher were even more difficult. Our feet were slipping and sliding, our bodies swaying from side to side, relying entirely on our necks to move back and forth to maintain the balance of the stretcher. The exhaled breath formed thick white frost on our eyelashes, obscuring our vision, as if a piece of gauze was covering our eyes. Our hands and feet were frozen stiff, and the stretcher began to tilt. At this time, although the wounded soldier didn't say a word, we could see from his hand, which was firmly grasping the stretcher pole, that he was extremely nervous. Little Gan, panting heavily, comforted the wounded soldier, saying: "Comrade, you have eight legs under you carrying this stretcher, it's very stable!"

    We were almost at the center of the river. The water gradually rose over our chests, and waves splashed, crashing against our heads, as if wanting to swallow someone before it would be satisfied. Suddenly, I felt like I was losing weight, and I was about to be swept away by the waves. I felt a surge of anxiety in my heart: if I fell into the water, the wounded comrade would be in danger. He didn't sacrifice himself on the battlefield fighting the enemy, and we must not let him fall into the water from our hands today. I desperately held on, paddling with one hand, while shouting to Little Gan: "Be careful of your feet, be careful!" At this critical moment, Chen Wenshu and several other comrades came over, took our hands, and helped the stretcher, which barely straightened us up, but we still involuntarily slid downstream with the current.

    "What are those people doing?" Someone asked us.

    "Carrying a wounded soldier."

    "Why are they still going downstream? Quick, go back quickly."

    Seeing that we were continuing to drift downstream, the person shouted: "Comrades with less to carry, come here to me!" There was a burst of commotion in the river, and many people went to him.

    "Stand firm, line up in a row, keep a little distance...." That person organized the team and said to us: "Okay, we'll block the waves above, and you can walk below." He led the people over, holding hands, forming a transverse "dam," cutting off the fierce torrent. We really felt much lighter, our feet were steadier, and we no longer slid downstream.

    As we were walking, we suddenly faintly heard someone speaking in a heavy tone ahead, and one of them asked: "Who is it, who is it?"

    "Uncle Yan, the division's animal handler."

    "What happened?"

    "The big black mule carrying the heavy machine gun was washed away!"

    Uncle Yan, what a familiar and dear name! This old comrade, who was nearly forty years old, loved us young comrades very much, often puffing on his bamboo pipe that he made himself, telling us stories of the past with a smile. Just before crossing the river, he was still sitting on the beach telling battle stories, encouraging our confidence in crossing the river. But now we would never hear his vivid and interesting stories again.

    The unit moved forward in silence. Suddenly, someone began to sing a majestic song:

    The Red Army's will is stronger than steel.
    Unafraid of stormy waves. ......

    Instantly, everyone joined in singing, drowning out the roar of the waves.

    We finally conquered the Han River and reached the opposite bank. To reduce the cold, we ran into a small town.

    Fearing to disturb the villagers' sleep, the troops all lay down on the streets and under the eaves to rest. Their clothes were frozen into ice, shining like glass. Many comrades' legs and feet were cut by ice chips and stones while wading, with streaks of blood hanging from them.

    At dawn, an old man walked up to us. He looked at this group of
    "glass people" with a dubious gaze, and muttered in a low voice:
    "What are you doing here, and where did you come from?"

    "We are the Red Army, and we crossed the river last night."

    "The Red Army? Crossed the river?" He repeated this sentence. At first, his face showed suspicion, but when he saw our frozen clothes and bleeding legs and feet, he suddenly understood. He turned around and muttered to himself: "It's the Red Army, they crossed the river." He ran off to tell the villagers.

    Before long, many villagers came running with firewood in their arms, lighting several fires for us to dry our clothes, and chatting with us about our families. Among them, an old woman was carrying a large bottle of wine, saying as she walked: "Have a drink to drive away the cold."

    While chatting around the fire, the old man who first saw us exclaimed with emotion: "I've lived by the river my whole life, and I've never seen or heard of anyone crossing the river in the dead of winter. You Red Army are fighting for the poor, you have good hearts, even the gods will protect you!"

    At this time, the Hu Zongnan bandit troops also pursued us to the riverbank, but the rolling river stood in front of them, and they could only sigh at the river.

    As for us, we put on our dried clothes and, bathed in the morning sun, calmly advanced towards the Daba Mountains.

    夜涉汉水
    张焕美
    一个数九隆冬的傍晚，红四方面军翻过秦岭，来到汉中平原的汉水岸上。江水宽有二、三里，在朦胧的夜色中，勉强可以看到起伏不平的对岸。浅滩处，已结了亮晶晶的冰凌，像无数把锋锐的小刀浮在水面。中间，水流湍急，波涛像猛兽般地吼叫着，滚动着，一个接着一个向下游涌去。
    部队战士穿着单薄的衣服，迎着飕飕的北风，在江岸上徘徊，焦急万分，心如火燎。前进，面前少船无桥，四个月连续行军作战、忍饥耐饿的身子，怎样涉过这澈骨而宽阔的寒流？停下，尾随在后面的胡宗南部队，就会赶到，背水迎战，对我们非常不利。同志们虽然默默不语，但心里却都在想着同一个问题：“怎么办？”
    “干脆，停在这儿等着敌人拼一场，咱手里拿的是枪，不是烧火棍……”黑暗中传来暴躁的声音。
    “别急嘛，总指挥到前面侦察涉江地点去了。这条江还能难住红军吗！”是谁在慢声细语地宽慰着。
    涉江，谈何容易！寒风、尖锐的冰凌、汹涌的波浪摆在大家面前，使人未曾入水先寒九分心。
    正在大家愁闷的时候，一个熟悉的、高而瘦削的身影出现在我们面前，他把手放在嘴角旁挡着风，大声地说：“同志们，侦察员骑着马来回探了几趟，只有这个地方可以趟过去。”这是徐向前总指挥的声音啊！看样子他是刚从江边回来的。人群中顿时鸦雀无声，静等着首长的指示。
    徐总指挥用一种商讨的口气问道：“怎么办呢？同志们！”“趟过去！”很多人异口同声地回答。
    “对了，趟，我们现在就趟过去，把敌人甩在后面。共产党员们跟我来！”
    徐总指挥带头跳进江里，靠岸沿上的薄冰，咔嚓咔嚓地在他脚下破碎了。他边走边回头呼喊：“英雄们，咱们来个渡江竞赛吧！”这话音刚落，同志们就开始了紧张的渡江准备工作。有的脱掉衣服，有的包扎伤口走下江岸。
    当时我是十一师医院的看护员，和几个小鬼抬着一位伤员行军。我们检查一下担架，怕不牢固，又用绳子捆了捆。安慰伤员几句之后，我们就把担架顶在头上，走进水里。脚一着水就被冰凌划破了，一阵刺心的难受，也不知道是痛还是冷。
    天空阴云密布，月亮也被乌云遮住。江面一片漆黑。这里，只见到无数的半截黑影在水面上艰难地摇晃；只听到寒风怒吼和哗哗的淌水声。不少黑影倒在水里，但又不声不响从下边几米的地方冒出来，继续往前与滚滚的汉水搏斗。
    我们几个顶着担架的小鬼，就更十分困难了，脚下一踩一滑，身子东倒西歪，全仗着脖子来回活动，保持担架的平衡。呼出的气在睫毛上结成厚厚的白霜，遮住视线，像有块纱布蒙着眼睛，手脚冻僵了，担架开始倾斜了。这时，那位伤员虽然一声不响，可是从他那只牢牢握着担架杆的手，可以看出他心情是异常紧张的。小甘喘着粗气，还安慰伤员说：“同志，你身底下是八条腿的担架，稳得很哩！”
    快到江心了，水渐渐没过胸膛，浪花飞起，冲击我们的头部，像要把谁吞下去才甘心。突然，我觉着好像失去了重量，眼看着就要被浪卷下去了，心里一阵着急：要是被水冲倒，伤员同志就危险了，他在战场和敌人拼杀都没有牺牲，今天决不能让他从我们手里翻在水里。我拼命地坚持着，一手划水，一边喊着小甘：“小心脚下，小心！”正在这紧要关头，陈文书和另外几个同志赶来了，拉着我们的手，扶着担架，这才勉强挺直身子，但还是不自主地顺着水流往下滑。
    “那一堆人是干什么的？”有谁在问我们。
    “抬伤员的。”
    “怎么还往下走呀？快，快往回走。”
    那人见我们继续往下漂，便大喊：“东西拿得少的同志们，都到我这里来！”江里一阵哗啦啦的骚动，有不少人奔他去了。
    “站好，排成一列，距离小点……。”那个人把队整理好，便向我们说：“好了，我们在上边挡着浪头，你们在下边走。”他带着人走过来，手挽着手，组成一堵横“坝”，切断了凶猛的激流，我们真感到身上轻快许多，脚跟站得稳了，再也不往下滑了。
    正走着，忽然隐约地听到前面有人用沉痛的声调说话，其中有个问：“是谁，是谁？”
    “师部饲养员烟伯伯。”
    “怎么搞的？”
    “驮重机枪的大黑骡子被水冲走了！”
    烟伯伯，多么熟悉，多么亲切的称呼呀！这位将近四十岁的老同志，对我们这群小鬼非常喜爱，经常叨着自己做的竹烟袋，笑呵呵地给我们说古论今。就在过江之前，他还坐在沙滩上讲战斗故事，鼓励我们涉江的信心。而现在再也听不到他那生动有趣的故事了。
    部队沉默地前进，忽然有人唱起雄伟的歌声：
    红军的意志胜如钢。
    不怕惊涛骇浪。………………
    霎时，大家都唱起来，压倒了波涛的吼叫。
    我们终于战胜了汉水，到达对岸。为了减轻身上的寒冷，我们跑步进了一个小镇子。
    怕打搅老乡们睡觉，部队都倒在街头、房檐下休息，衣服结成冰，像玻璃似地闪着光。许多同志的腿、脚在趟水时被冰屑、石头划破了，挂着一条条的血丝。
    天明时分，一位老汉走到我们面前，他用疑惑的眼光打量着这群
    “玻璃人”，半吞半吐低声问：
    “你们是干什么的，从哪里来？”
    “我们是红军，昨夜涉江过来的。”
    “红军？涉江过来的？”他反复叨咕着这句话。开始脸上露着怀疑的神色，后来看见我们冰冻的衣服，淌着鲜血的腿脚，就豁然开朗了。他转身自言自语：“是红军，是涉江过来的。”跑着告诉老乡们去了。
    不一会，许多老乡都抱着干柴跑来，点着几堆火让我们烤衣服，拉着我们谈家常。其中有位老大娘还拿着一大瓶酒，边走边说：“喝口酒，赶赶寒气。”
    围火闲谈的时候，最先看到我们的那位老大爷满有感慨地赞叹说：“我在江边住了一辈子，没见过，也没听说过，在十冬腊月涉水过江的。你们红军为穷人争天下，心好，连神仙都保佑你们哪！”
    这时，胡宗南匪军也追至江边，但滚滚的江水横在他们前面，他们只好望江兴叹了。
    而我们呢，穿好烤干了的衣服，踏着朝阳照耀的大地，从容不迫地向大巴山前进。
