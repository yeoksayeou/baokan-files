Grasp Animal Fattening, Grasp Mating, Grasp Improvement
Inner Mongolia's Current Number of Pregnant Livestock Reaches 70% of Last Year's Total
Qinghai's "Ten Thousand Sheep, Ten Thousand Lambs, Ten Thousand Cattle, Ten Thousand Calves, Ten Thousand Horses, Ten Thousand Foals" Movement Achieves Great Success

    (Reported by this newspaper) Taking advantage of the lush pastures and the robust condition of livestock, Inner Mongolia is focusing on and vigorously promoting livestock mating and improvement, which has already achieved remarkable results.
    With the deepening of the "One Hundred Mothers, One Hundred Offspring" movement, this year's livestock mating and improvement work in the autonomous region is better than in the past. To date, more than 1.17 million head of livestock have been impregnated, equivalent to 70% of the total number of impregnated livestock last year. In the Xilin Gol League pastoral area, people's communes are focusing on livestock as the key in their livestock production, carrying out the "One Hundred Mothers, One Hundred Offspring" movement. During the livestock mating and breeding season, they emphasized the "reproduction" and "improvement" of female livestock. Currently, 350,000 female livestock in the league are pregnant, accounting for 84.3% of the eligible female livestock. In the Badarhu People's Commune of Zalaite Banner, thanks to the party committee secretary's division of responsibilities, rotational inspections, and the adoption of effective measures such as the combination of four personnel (grazing, feeding, mating, and veterinary staff), strengthening feeding management, and intensive mating improvement, all of the commune's more than 5,100 eligible female livestock are now pregnant.
    This year, the scale and quantity of livestock improvement in the autonomous region surpass any previous year. In order to conscientiously implement the policy of simultaneously emphasizing quantity and quality, a large number of mating technicians were trained at the beginning of this year, and livestock mating stations were generally established in communes and teams. As a result, among the pregnant female livestock in the region, more than 340,000 head have been mated and improved with fine breeding livestock, which is 30,000 head more than the total number of cattle and horses improved last year.
    Implementing immediate mating after delivery is an important reason for the rapid increase in livestock mating and improvement in the autonomous region this year. As early as before and after the beginning of spring this year, during the livestock breeding season, people's communes strengthened the feeding management of female livestock to keep the post-partum animals in good condition and restore their health. They also extensively carried out immediate mating after delivery, enabling more female livestock to participate in mating.
    (Reported by this newspaper) Qinghai Province's mass movement of "Ten Thousand Sheep, Ten Thousand Lambs, Ten Thousand Cattle, Ten Thousand Calves, Ten Thousand Horses, Ten Thousand Foals," which focuses on improving the fertility rate of eligible female livestock and the survival rate of young livestock, has achieved remarkable results. As of now, the survival rate of large and small livestock produced throughout the province has increased by more than 16% compared to the same period last year. Some ewes have achieved two births in one year, with more than 12,000 ewes producing twins, triplets, or quadruplets, and 835 cows producing twin calves. There are 1,051 livestock herds that have achieved the "five-full" bumper harvest of full mating, full pregnancy, full birth, full survival, and full robustness among eligible female livestock.
    Maintaining full condition year-round is the fundamental key to achieving high yields from eligible female livestock. By focusing on high-yield herds, all regions have greatly improved the level of feeding and management of all livestock. To ensure high yields, all regions have closely focused on various measures to increase livestock production (such as large-scale grassland water conservancy, grassland improvement, the establishment of feed bases, continuous adjustment of livestock herds, and the implementation of seasonal rotational grazing), strengthening feeding management; storing green fodder, building sheds and pens, and preventing frost to protect livestock. From the prefectures and counties to the production teams, one secretary is in charge of livestock production, and a large number of cadres have been transferred to strengthen specific leadership by adopting a layer-by-layer contract system. In the grazing team, the leadership of poor herdsmen has been established, and a system of contracting work, output, and finance, as well as setting quotas for livestock, people, grasslands, and tools, with rewards for overproduction, has been generally implemented. At the same time, all regions have extensively carried out appraisal and competition activities focusing on improving the breeding survival rate, summarizing experiences, and commending advanced individuals, thereby promoting livestock production to new heights. During the lambing season last winter and this spring in Qaidam, the broad masses of commune members gave full play to their initiative and creativity, adopting methods such as "double-circle insulation," "warm lamb sheds," and classified management of lambs, effectively overcoming the severe cold and achieving a lamb survival rate of over 90%.
    Now, the grasslands are in the prime season of lush water and grass, and herdsmen of all ethnic groups are making every effort to fatten livestock and focus on mating. Due to the good condition of all types of livestock, with female livestock coming into heat early and strongly, coupled with the promotion of artificial estrus and hot mating, many female livestock have been fully mated and are fully pregnant ahead of schedule.

### 抓畜膘　抓配种　抓改良  内蒙古目前大家畜受胎母畜已相当去年全年的70％  青海开展“万羊万羔万牛万犊万马万驹”运动成绩大

    抓畜膘　抓配种　抓改良
    内蒙古目前大家畜受胎母畜已相当去年全年的70％
    青海开展“万羊万羔万牛万犊万马万驹”运动成绩大
    本报讯　乘牧草繁茂牲畜肥壮的大好时机，内蒙古各地狠抓实抓大畜配种改良，现已取得显著成就。
    随着“百母百仔”运动的深入开展，今年自治区大畜配种改良工作比以往做得好。到目前，全区大家畜受胎母畜已达一百一十七万多头，相当于去年全年受胎母畜的70％。锡林郭勒牧区各人民公社，今年在畜牧业生产上，以大畜为纲开展“百母百仔”运动，在大畜配种繁殖季节，突出地抓了母畜“繁”、“改”，现在全盟有三十五万头母畜受胎，已占大畜适龄母畜的84.3％。扎赉特旗巴达尔胡人民公社，由于党委书记分片包干、巡回检查，采取四员（放牧、饲养、配种、兽医员）相结合，加强饲养管理、突击配种改良等有效措施，全社五千一百多头适龄母畜，现在全部受胎怀孕。
    今年，自治区大畜改良规模之大、数量之多，胜过以往任何一年。各地为了认真执行数量与质量同时并重方针，今年年初就训练了大批配种技术员，社社队队普遍建立了大畜配种站。因而全区受胎的母畜中，目前用优良种畜配种改良的母畜达三十四万多头，比去年全年改良的牛马还要多三万头。
    实行随产随配是今年自治区大家畜配种改良迅速上升的重要原因。早在今年入春前后，正值大家畜繁殖季节，各地人民公社一面加强母畜饲养管理，让产仔母畜保持原膘，恢复健康，广泛开展随产随配活动，使更多的母畜参加了配种。
    本报讯　青海省以提高适龄母畜繁殖率和仔畜成活率为中心的“万羊万羔、万牛万犊、万马万驹”群众运动，获得了显著成效。截至目前，全省已产大小家畜的成活率比去年同期提高16％以上，并有一部分母羊实现了一年两产，一万两千多只母羊分别产了双羔、三羔或四羔，八百三十五头母牛产了双犊，适龄母畜中出现的全配、全怀、全生、全活、全壮的五全丰产畜群达到一千零五十一群。
    常年满膘是实现适龄母畜高额丰产的根本关键。各地通过狠抓高额丰产群，大大提高了所有牲畜的饲放管理水平。为了确保高额丰产，各地都紧紧围绕畜牧业增产的各项措施（例如大兴草原水利，改良草原，建立饲料基地，不断调整畜群，推行四季轮牧），加强饲放管理；打储青草，修棚打圈，防冻保畜。各地从州县到生产队都有一位书记专管畜牧业生产，并抽调大批干部采取层层包干的办法，加强具体领导。在放牧员队伍中，都树立了贫牧民领导的优势，并普遍实行了包工包产包财务和定畜、定人、定草原、定工具的超产奖励制度。同时各地还广泛开展以提高繁殖成活率为中心的评比竞赛活动，及时总结经验，表扬先进，从而促使畜牧业生产一浪高过一浪。柴达木各地在去冬今春的母羊产羔期间，广大社员发挥积极性与创造性，采取“双圈保温”、“羔棚暖化”和分类管理羊羔的办法，有效地战胜严寒，使羊羔成活率高达90％以上。
    现在，草原上正是水草丰美的大好季节，各族牧民正在千方百计大抓畜膘，狠抓配种。由于各类牲畜膘肥体壮，母畜发情既早又旺，加上推行人工催情热配的结果，许多母畜已经提前全配满怀。（附图片）
