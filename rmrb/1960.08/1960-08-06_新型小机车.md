Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 4th: The Changchun Locomotive Factory recently successfully trial-produced a new type of small steam locomotive suitable for rural and mining transportation, and named it the "Spark" type locomotive. After appraisal, the mechanical performance of the locomotive fully meets the design standards, and mass production began in early August.

　　The "Spark" type locomotive has an efficiency of 234 horsepower and can run on dirt railways. It can tow more than 300 tons on a 6‰ slope. Each load of coal can run 75 kilometers, and each load of water can run 105 kilometers. This locomotive has a simple structure, small body, convenient driving, and is easy to operate.

　　During the trial production of the locomotive, the factory Party committee launched a design revolution by mobilizing the masses on the principle of ensuring that the mechanical performance of the locomotive was not affected, and a total of 76 design modifications were made. After the reform, the weight of the "Spark" type locomotive now produced has been reduced from the original design of 38 tons to 30 tons; the man-hours for producing each locomotive have also been greatly saved; and the cost of each locomotive has also been reduced by 17.4% compared with the original design.

    新型小机车
    据新华社长春4日电　长春机车厂最近试制成功一台适于农村、矿山运输用的新式小型蒸气机车，并定名为“星火”型机车。经过鉴定，机车的机械性能完全合乎设计标准，并于8月初开始成批生产。
      “星火”型机车的工效为二百三十四马力，能在土铁路上行驶，可以在千分之六的坡道上牵引三百多吨重量；每装一次煤可运行七十五公里，每上一次水可运行一百零五公里。这种机车结构简单，车体轻小，驾驶方便，容易操纵。
    在机车试制过程中，工厂党委在保证不影响机车的机械性能的原则下，发动群众展开了设计大革命，共修改了七十六项设计。经过改革，现在生产的“星火”型机车自重由原设计的三十八吨减少到三十吨；生产每台机车的工时也大大节省；每台机车的成本也比原设计降低17.4％。
