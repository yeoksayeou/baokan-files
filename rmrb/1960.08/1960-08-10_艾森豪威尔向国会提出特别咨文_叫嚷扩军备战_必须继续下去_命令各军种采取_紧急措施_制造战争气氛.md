Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th: U.S. President Eisenhower yesterday submitted a special message to Congress, vigorously advocating that the U.S. executive and legislative branches must, as a matter of "urgent need," accelerate military expansion and war preparations. Eisenhower said, "Vigilance must remain our [U.S.] watchword," and "continuing strength—militarily, economically, and spiritually—must remain that on which we rely."

In his message, Eisenhower emphasized that the military expansion and war preparations plans that the United States has long pursued "must continue."

Eisenhower called the shooting down of a U.S. military reconnaissance plane that intruded into Soviet airspace, the breakdown of the Geneva Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting, and the rising tide of anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Central Africa and Cuba as so-called "cruel acts of Communism." He belligerently clamored that, after a "continuing appraisal" of these developments, "I have directed the Services to take certain immediate actions pertaining to the readiness posture and status of our military forces, including the addition of certain aircraft carriers to the Sixth and Seventh Fleets. A number of B-47 medium bombers and supporting tankers, originally scheduled for phase-out, will be temporarily retained in active service; the Strategic Air Command’s alert posture will be stepped up and its deployments further dispersed. The readiness of our ground forces will also be improved further through increases in the number and scope of strategic field and air transport exercises.”

Eisenhower said that in addition to these "emergency measures," he also ordered the "expansion of certain of our longer-term [military expansion and war preparation] programs." He said that the ability of the Strategic Air Command to conduct continuous airborne alert will be further strengthened; more funds will be used for the modernization of Army combat equipment and military air transport; and the development of the B-70 (bomber) and the "Samos" reconnaissance satellite will be accelerated. He also vigorously advocated expanding the development of the "Polaris" ballistic missile submarine program, pointing out that the number of such submarines to be built in the United States this fiscal year has been increased from three to five, and that an order has been issued to develop a "longer-range" "Polaris" missile.

Eisenhower said that the U.S. Department of Defense "will make every effort to use its existing resources to implement these expansion plans." At the same time, he emphasized that if a request is made, he "will promptly request the necessary funds [from Congress]" to "increase some military personnel as well as administrative and maintenance costs."

Eisenhower also requested the restoration of the more than 500 million U.S. dollars in so-called "foreign aid" appropriations that had been cut by Congress, in order to urge its allies to expand their military and prepare for war and to promote U.S. aggression policies. He said that it is not enough for the United States to strengthen its own military power, and the United States also needs to "build up the strength of the free world everywhere." He also requested an additional 100 million U.S. dollars in "emergency funds" to step up the suppression of national independence movements, so that the so-called "United States is prepared for sudden developments in situations like the one that appeared in the Congo."

Eisenhower also requested that Congress approve a 600 million U.S. dollar so-called "aid" plan for Latin American countries in order to further infiltrate U.S. power into Latin American countries and promote U.S. aggression policies in Latin America.

When talking about the domestic situation, Eisenhower admitted that the U.S. agricultural crisis was severe, the economic situation was not good, and the threat of inflation was serious. The so-called four billion U.S. dollar surplus that he boasted about in his budget message at the beginning of the year will be lost.

    艾森豪威尔向国会提出特别咨文
    叫嚷扩军备战“必须继续下去”
    命令各军种采取“紧急措施”制造战争气氛
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔昨天向国会提出一个特别咨文，大力鼓吹美国的行政和立法部门必须作为一项“急迫的需要”加紧进行扩军备战。艾森豪威尔说，“提高警惕必须仍然是我们（美国）的口号”，而“在军事上、经济上和精神上继续保持力量必须仍然是我们所依靠的东西”。
    艾森豪威尔在咨文里强调说，美国长期以来所推行的扩军备战计划“必须继续下去”。
    艾森豪威尔把侵入苏联领空的美国军用侦察飞机被击落、日内瓦十国裁军委员会会议的破裂以及中非和古巴人民的反帝斗争的高涨等事件都叫做所谓“共产主义的残酷行径”。他穷兵黩武地叫嚷说，在对这些发展进行了“持续的估计以后”，“我已经命令各军种就我们军事部队的准备状况和地位采取一些实际措施，其中包括增派一些航空母舰给第六和第七舰队。原定要分阶段退役的一批B—47中型轰炸机和附属于它们的加油机将暂时保留在现役中；战略空军司令部的工作速度将加快，它的部署将进一步分散。我们地面部队的准备状况也将由于战略性的野战和空运演习的次数和范围的增加而得到进一步的改进”。
    艾森豪威尔说，除了上述这些“紧急性措施”外，他还命令了“扩大（美国）某些长期的（扩军备战）计划”。他说，战略空军司令部进行不断的空中警戒的能力将进一步加强；将把更多的款项用于陆军战斗装备现代化和军事空运方面；将加紧发展B—70型（轰炸机）和“萨摩斯”侦察卫星。他还大力鼓吹扩大发展“北极星”弹道导弹潜艇的计划，指出美国本财政年度增建这种潜艇的数目已从三艘增加为五艘，并且已经下令发展一种“射程更远”的“北极星”导弹。
    艾森豪威尔说，美国国防部“将尽可能把它现有的力量用来执行这些扩军计划”。同时，他强调说，如果一旦提出要求，他“将迅速要求（国会给予）必要的款项”，以“增加一些军事人员以及管理和维持费用”。
    艾森豪威尔还要求恢复被国会削减的五亿多美元所谓“援外”拨款，来督促其盟国扩军备战和推行美国侵略政策。他说，美国仅仅加强自己的军事力量还是不够的，美国还需要“在各地建立自由世界的力量。”他还要求增拨一亿美元“紧急费”来加紧镇压民族独立运动，使所谓“美国对像刚果出现的那样的突然的局势发展有所准备”。
    艾森豪威尔还要求国会批准为数六亿美元的所谓“援助”拉丁美洲国家的计划，以便美国势力进一步渗入拉丁美洲国家，推行美国在拉丁美洲的侵略政策。
    在谈到国内情况的时候，艾森豪威尔承认美国农业危机深重，经济情况不妙，通货膨胀威胁严重，他年初在预算咨文中吹嘘的所谓四十亿美元的结余将要告吹。
