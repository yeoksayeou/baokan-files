Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The full text of the congratulatory telegram from the people of all circles in the capital of the People's Republic of China to the "Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament": To the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and forwarded to the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament:

    The people of all circles in the capital of the People's Republic of China held a grand gathering on August 5th, resolutely supporting the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament, resolutely supporting the Japanese people's just struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and expressing warm and lofty respect to the heroic Japanese people and the representatives of all countries attending the conference.

    The Japanese people have waged a long-term, unyielding struggle to ban nuclear weapons and oppose the nuclear war threat of U.S. imperialism, to safeguard national independence, and to defend Asian and world peace. In particular, in the past two years, the broad masses of the Japanese people have launched an unprecedented national patriotic and just struggle, with opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance and U.S. military bases as its core. This struggle has not only severely hit the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and disrupted the U.S. imperialist aggression plan in Asia, but also greatly encouraged the people of the world in their struggle against U.S. imperialism, making a significant contribution to defending Asian and world peace. The victory of the Japanese people once again proves that the power of the people is invincible. As long as the broad masses of the people unite and persevere in their struggle, the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and its lackeys can be completely defeated and crushed.

    The Chinese people have consistently advocated the prohibition of nuclear weapons and general disarmament, and have consistently advocated establishing friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We fully support our government's repeated proposals to all countries in Asia and the Pacific Rim, including the United States, to sign a treaty of non-aggression and to transform this region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. We fully support the Soviet Union and other socialist countries' initiatives for disarmament and the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, and the series of efforts made to this end. However, U.S. imperialism has stubbornly pursued a policy of war and aggression, actively preparing for nuclear war, and constantly carrying out provocative activities, making itself an enemy of the people of Asia and the world. In order to achieve the prohibition of nuclear weapons, general disarmament, and the defense of world peace, the people of the world must unite and wage unremitting struggles against the forces of war and aggression headed by U.S. imperialism. The 650 million Chinese people are willing to stand forever with the Japanese people and the people of the world, and with greater efforts, fight to the end to completely shatter the U.S. imperialist policy of war and aggression, to strive for the realization of the prohibition of nuclear weapons and general disarmament, and to defend Asian and world peace.

    In the struggle against our common enemy—U.S. imperialism—the Chinese and Japanese people have always encouraged and supported each other, advancing hand in hand. The friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people, which have been consolidated and developed in the struggle, cannot be undermined by any force. The Chinese people firmly believe that, in today's world where imperialism is increasingly isolated and heading towards its demise, and where the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the forces of the people of the world are unprecedentedly united and strong, the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will surely overcome all difficulties, move forward, and achieve final and complete victory.

    The Chinese people sincerely congratulate the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament on achieving new and greater success, and wish the friendly unity of the people of all countries to be further strengthened and developed.

    Long live the common cause of the people of all countries against imperialist aggression and for the defense of world peace!

    Long live world peace!

    The People of All Circles in the Capital of the People's Republic of China Supporting the "Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for General Disarmament" Conference.
				August 5, 1960, in Beijing

    首都支持禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的大会发出贺电
    日本人民的正义斗争必获最后胜利
    中日两国人民在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中相互支持携手前进
    新华社5日讯　中华人民共和国首都各界人民致“第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会”贺电全文：日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会并转第六届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会：
    中华人民共和国首都各界人民于8月5日举行隆重集会，坚决支持第六届禁止原子弹、氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会，坚决支持日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的正义斗争，并向英勇的日本人民和参加大会的各国代表致以热烈的崇高的敬意。
    日本人民为禁止核武器和反对美帝国主义的核战争威胁，为维护民族独立，为保卫亚洲和世界和平，进行了长期的不屈不挠的斗争。特别是近两年来，日本广大人民展开了以反对日美军事同盟、反对美国军事基地为核心的，规模空前的全民性爱国正义斗争。这个斗争不仅沉重地打击了美日反动派，打乱了美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略计划，而且大大鼓舞了世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，对保卫亚洲和世界和平作出了重大的贡献。日本人民的胜利再一次证明：人民的力量是不可战胜的。只要广大的人民群众团结一致、坚持斗争，帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋诡计是完全能够被击败和被粉碎的。
    中国人民一贯主张禁止核武器和普遍裁军，一贯主张在和平共处的五项原则的基础上同各国建立友好关系。我们完全拥护我国政府一再提出的关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国包括美国在内，签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约和把这个地区变成为无核武器地区的建议。我们全力支持苏联和其它社会主义国家关于裁军和禁止使用核武器的倡议和为此所作的一系列努力。但是，美帝国主义却一直顽固地执行战争侵略政策，积极准备核战争，不断进行挑衅活动，与亚洲和全世界人民为敌。为了实现禁止核武器、普遍裁军和保卫世界和平，全世界人民必须联合起来，同以美帝国主义为首的战争侵略势力进行不懈的斗争。六亿五千万中国人民愿意永远同日本人民和全世界人民站在一起，并且以更大的努力，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义的战争侵略政策，为争取实现禁止核武器和普遍裁军，为保卫亚洲和世界和平奋斗到底。
    中日两国人民在反对共同敌人——美帝国主义的斗争中，一直相互鼓舞，相互支持，携手前进。在斗争中巩固和发展起来的中日两国人民的友好关系是任何力量破坏不了的。中国人民深信：在帝国主义日益孤立和走向死亡，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和世界人民的力量空前团结和强大的今天，日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争，一定能排除一切困难，向前发展，从而取得最后的、彻底的胜利。
    中国人民衷心祝贺第六届禁止原子弹、氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会获得新的更大的成功，祝各国人民的友好团结进一步加强和发展。
    各国人民反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的共同事业胜利万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    中华人民共和国首都各界人民支持“第六届禁止
      原子弹氢弹和争取全面裁军世界大会”大会
