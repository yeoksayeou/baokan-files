Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 29th: Japanese public figures welcome the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between China and Afghanistan.

    Hakamada Satomi, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, told reporters today that China and Afghanistan have made a great contribution to world peace by signing a Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression.

    He said that the Sino-Afghan Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression is a fruit born from the soil of the Bandung spirit. He pointed out: "The Bandung spirit has once again been proven to be the guiding principle of relations between Asian and African countries."

    Hakamada Satomi pointed out: "At the same time, the conclusion of this treaty means that American imperialism is even more isolated in Asia."

    Referring to the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, Hakamada Satomi said that the newly signed Sino-Afghan Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression is another factor that isolates the Japanese ruling group among the people of Asia and Africa, because under the light of the newly signed Sino-Afghan Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression, the criminal essence of the Japan-U.S. military alliance is even more exposed.

    Hakamada Satomi emphasized that the Japanese people will draw greater strength from the ideal international relations between China and Afghanistan, and will carry out the struggle to abolish the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" more vigorously than ever before.

    Okakura Koshirō, representative member of the Japan Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, said that the newly signed Sino-Afghan Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression is an outstanding contribution to the development of solidarity among Asian and African countries.

    Okakura said: "After concluding treaties of peace and friendship between China and Burma and China and Nepal, China has once again taken the initiative to pursue a policy of peaceful diplomacy."

    He emphasized: "Although reactionary chieftains at home and abroad are clamoring about China's so-called denial of the policy of peaceful coexistence, the new measures taken by China in its relations with Afghanistan have shattered this vicious rumor."

    日本公众领袖欢迎中阿条约

    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本公众领袖欢迎中国和阿富汗缔结友好和互不侵犯条约。
    日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员袴田里见今天对记者说，中国和阿富汗通过缔结友好和互不侵犯条约对世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。
    他说，中国和阿富汗友好和互不侵犯条约是在万隆精神的土壤上产生的果实。他指出：“万隆精神再次被证明是亚非国家之间关系的指导原则。”
    袴田里见指出：“同时，缔结这个条约意味着美国帝国主义在亚洲更加孤立了。”
    袴田里见在提到日美军事同盟条约时说，新签订的中国和阿富汗友好和互不侵犯条约是使日本统治集团在亚非人民中间陷于孤立的又一个因素，因为在新签订的中国和阿富汗友好和互不侵犯条约的照耀下，日美军事同盟的罪恶本质更加暴露无遗了。
    袴田里见强调说，日本人民将从中国和阿富汗之间的理想的国际关系中吸取更大的力量，并将比过去任何时候更加大力地进行废除新日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    日本亚非团结委员会代表委员冈仓古志郎说，中国和阿富汗新签订的友好和互不侵犯条约是对发展亚非国家之间的团结的突出贡献。
    冈仓说：“中国在缔结中缅和中尼（泊尔）之间的和平和友好条约之后，再一次采取主动，推行和平的外交政策。”
    他强调说：“虽然国内外反动头目们正在叫嚣所谓中国否定和平共处的政策，但中国在其同阿富汗的关系中采取的新的措施粉碎了这种恶毒的谣言。”
