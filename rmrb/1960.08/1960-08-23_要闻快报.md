	Hundred Furnaces Without Scrap Steel

The Changchun Steel Plant mobilized the masses to launch a "Hundred Furnaces Without Scrap Steel" campaign. Leading cadres went deep into various workshops and groups, adopting methods such as "checking quality, checking output, checking consumption, checking equipment, and checking management" to help each workshop and each group inspect production and summarize experience. Since August, five major quality bottlenecks have been broken through in succession, causing the average daily output of steel ingots in mid-August to increase sharply by 100% compared with early August. The qualified rate of steel ingots increased from 68.5% to over 99%, achieving "Hundred Furnaces Without Scrap Steel".

	Rushing to Manufacture Hot-Blast Stove Equipment

In the campaign to increase steel production, 27 machinery factories in Chongqing are rushing to manufacture hot-blast stove equipment for steel plants. In order to enable the hot-blast stoves to be installed and put into production quickly, the machinery factories also adopted the method of "complete responsibility," organizing more than 1,000 workers to go to the steel plant construction site to carry out crash installation and furnace masonry projects. They also continuously absorbed the opinions of processing units to further improve manufacturing quality, in order to guarantee that steel plants achieve high and quality converter steel production.

	Pig Iron with High Quality and High Output

The broad masses of workers on the Jinan steel and iron front are launching a competition centered on improving the quality of pig iron, promoting high output with high quality, and achieving a double leap in quality and output. In this movement, leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the front lines of production, laboring alongside workers and discussing solutions to key problems in production, greatly boosting the morale of the masses and promoting the rapid improvement of pig iron quality and output. From August 11th to 15th, the average qualified rate of pig iron in the city increased by 17.4% compared with early August; the average daily production level of pig iron increased by 7.5% compared with early August.

	Paving the Way for Coal Mining

The Shandong Xiaozhuang Coal Mine has transferred labor to strengthen the tunneling teams and improve the development methods. It has changed from tunneling only one coal seam in each well in the past to tunneling multiple coal seams; and from tunneling and mining simultaneously in one area in the past to having two to three areas tunneling simultaneously in each well, with another one to two areas being mined. This has enabled the recoverable period of raw coal to reach more than half a year, and the reserve working face to reach more than 25%, creating conditions for the sustained leap forward in coal production.

	Increasing Production and Saving Raw Materials

Workers at the Qingdao No. 9 Rubber Factory are actively increasing production and saving raw materials to promote a sustained leap forward in production. They have built their own chemical workshop to produce more than ten kinds of chemical raw materials such as polysulfide rubber, tung oil rubber, and polyvinyl chloride. They are also vigorously carrying out comprehensive utilization, reasonably improving product design, formulas, and processes, and paying attention to saving raw materials in every little way. In the first seven months of this year, the raw materials saved by the factory can increase the production of 170,000 pairs of rubber shoes.

    要闻快报
    百炉无废钢
    长春市钢厂发动群众开展“百炉无废钢”竞赛，领导干部深入各车间、小组采取“查质量、查产量、查消耗、查设备、查管理”的办法，帮助各车间、各小组检查生产，总结经验。八月份以来，连破五个重大质量关键，使钢锭平均日产量中旬比上旬猛增一倍，钢锭合格率由百分之六十八点五提高到百分之九十九以上，实现了“百炉无废钢”。
    赶制热风炉设备
    在增产钢的运动中，重庆市二十七个机械厂为钢厂赶制热风炉设备。为了使热风炉能迅速安装，投入生产，各机械厂还采取“一包到底”的方法，组织了一千多名职工到钢厂施工现场，突击热风炉安装、砌炉工程，并不断吸取加工单位的意见，进一步提高制造质量，以保证钢厂实现转炉高产优质。
    生铁优质高产
    济南市钢铁战线上的广大职工，正在开展以提高生铁质量为中心、以优质带高产、实现质量产量双跃进的竞赛运动。在这个运动中，各级领导干部纷纷深入生产第一线，和职工一起劳动、一起商量解决生产中的关键问题，大大鼓舞了群众的干劲，促进了生铁质量，产量迅速提高。八月十一日至十五日，全市生铁平均合格率比八月上旬提高百分之十七点四；生铁平均日产水平比八月上旬提高了百分之七点五。
    为采煤开路
    山东夏庄煤矿抽调劳动力充实掘进队伍，改进开拓方法，把过去每个井只一个煤层掘进，改为多煤层掘进；把过去一个区域同时掘进、回采，改为每个井同时有二至三个区域掘进，另外一到两个区域进行回采。使原煤可采期达到半年多，备用工作面达到百分之二十五以上，为煤炭生产持续跃进创造了条件。
    增产节约原材料
    青岛橡胶九厂职工积极增产节约原材料，促进生产持续跃进。他们自建化工车间，生产聚硫橡胶、桐油橡胶、聚氯乙烯等十多种化工原材料，并大搞综合利用，合理改进产品设计、配方和工艺，注意点滴节约原材料。今年前七个月全厂所节约的原材料，可以增产胶鞋十七万双。
