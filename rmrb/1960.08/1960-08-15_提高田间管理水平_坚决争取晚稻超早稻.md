    Improve Field Management Level and Resolutely Strive for Late Rice to Surpass Early Rice
    The Communist Party of China, Nanxian County Committee, Hunan Province

    Nanxian County's late rice acreage will expand to about 450,000 mu this year. Judging from the current situation, all tasks are generally done solidly, with abundant and high-quality base fertilizer, and meticulous plowing and harrowing. In terms of water conservancy conditions, self-flowing irrigation and drainage area can reach about 70%. Without extraordinary natural disasters, there is no worry about drought or flood. In particular, the Party has strengthened its leadership over agricultural production, and the working style of the vast number of cadres has been further improved, with greater revolutionary drive and better connections with the masses, providing a strong guarantee for late rice to surpass early rice. After two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, we have accumulated rich experience in late rice surpassing early rice. For example, the 17,600 mu of late rice in Huage Commune had an average yield of more than 520 jin per mu last year, an increase of 4% over early rice. There are more than 12,000 mu of fields with a yield of more than 800 jin per mu in the county, thoroughly breaking the superstition that late rice cannot surpass early rice. All of this has laid a good foundation for a large-scale bumper harvest of late rice. It not only shows the possibility of late rice surpassing early rice, but also the reliability of late rice surpassing early rice.

    However, we should also see the new situations and new problems in this year's late rice production: First, the late rice area is large this year (50% more than last year and 40% more than early rice), and the workload of cultivation and management has increased accordingly, especially for the newly expanded late rice fields - wasteland reclamation, ditch and harbor excavation, etc., making field management work even more complex. Second, the winter temperature was high and there was little ice and snow last year, so the mortality rate of pests was low. For example, the mortality rate of rice borers was 47% lower than in 1958. Therefore, the possibility of rice borers, leafhoppers, rice leaf rollers and other pests harming late rice is greater than last year. Third, although the base fertilizer for late rice is generally abundant, the distribution is not very balanced, and 10% of the late rice fields are severely lacking fertilizer. Fourth, due to the delay in the maturity of early rice by a few days, the seedling age of some late rice has reached more than 50 days, with long stems and lush leaves. If managed improperly after transplanting, it is prone to lodging and prolongs the "greening period" of the seedlings. Fifth, the transplanting time will be delayed by a few days compared to last year.

    "Fields are cultivated by people, and success depends on human effort." On the road to striving for a large-scale bumper harvest of late rice, although there are some difficulties as mentioned above, these are not the main ones after all. As long as we, under the leadership of the Party, hold high the invincible banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully estimate our favorable conditions, and also appropriately estimate certain difficult conditions, and resolutely adopt various early-maturing and high-yielding measures in response to the new situations and new problems in this year's late rice growth, it is indeed entirely possible to strive for a large-scale high yield of late rice. In terms of specific measures, we are prepared to do the following:

    Check Seedlings and Replenish Hills Early to Overcome the Full Stand Stage

    The increase in unit area yield of rice is the increase in the total number of panicles and the total number of grains per mu. The increase in the total number of panicles must first ensure that there is an appropriate number of seedlings, rely on the main panicles, strive for tillering, and achieve the goal of more panicles and more grains. Last year, the first production team of the Huahong Production Brigade of the Qianzihong Brigade of the Mahekou Commune had a dry-seeded rice field transplanted four days after the autumn harvest. Due to close planting at 4×7 inches, with 12 to 14 seedlings per hill, the result was 250,000 seedlings per mu, with a yield of 566 jin. In the adjacent late rice field, transplanted eight days before the "Beginning of Autumn," only five to seven seedlings were transplanted per hill, and the total number of seedlings was too small, resulting in a yield of only 520 jin. From this, it can be seen that ensuring a sufficient number of seedlings is still an important key to increasing late rice production. After the late rice is transplanted, forces must be immediately organized to conduct a seedling check, support seedlings, and replenish hills, ensuring that each field is inspected with seedlings, walking through each row, checking and replenishing at the same time, straightening floating hills, and replenishing missing hills.

    Reasonably Topdress Fertilizer and Intertillage to Break Through the Tillering Stage

    Striving for more effective panicles is one of the important factors in increasing late rice production. According to the analysis of the County Institute of Agricultural Sciences, the fertilizer required by late rice during the tillering period accounts for more than 40% of the entire growth period. Therefore, the earliness and quantity of tillering are most closely related to the supply of fertilizer. In 1959, the seventh production team of the Baopo Production Brigade of the Yucai Commune had a three-mu "Wan Baqiu" field using the "Songchang 261" high-quality japonica rice variety. Eight days after transplanting, the first intertillage and topdressing was carried out, applying five dan of manure per mu. Combined with the second intertillage, another seven jin of chemical fertilizer was applied per mu. Due to early intertillage and early topdressing, the average yield of late rice was 520 jin per mu, an increase of 25% over early rice. Also, because the growing period of late rice is longer, and japonica rice requires even more fertilizer, it is not as some people say, "Late rice does not need manure, just autumn rain." It is necessary to apply sufficient base fertilizer, and more topdressing, early topdressing, and skillful topdressing. Especially in the case of this year's late rice being transplanted a few days later than last year, it is necessary to actively increase fertilizer application, master the principle of early topdressing, and prevent the occurrence of fertilizer deficiency, in order to meet the needs of late rice growth and development and ensure early maturity and high yield. Topdressing should be combined with intertillage and carried out in stages, generally three times. After the late rice seedlings survive, topdress with tillering fertilizer as soon as possible, combined with the first intertillage, apply 10 to 15 jin of ammonium sulfate or 5 to 6 dan of fermented human manure per mu. For fields implementing straw returning to the field, it is necessary to topdress with quick-acting fertilizer to meet the needs. After this topdressing, for fields where the seedlings are not growing well and the base fertilizer is lacking, another tillering fertilizer should be applied in combination with the second intertillage to eliminate third-class seedlings as soon as possible. For fields where the seedlings are growing well, the field base is fertile, or the acidity is high, 50 to 60 jin of lime should be applied per mu in combination with the second intertillage. After the late rice enters the jointing stage, during the differentiation and development of young ears, the effect of applying ear fertilizer is extremely great, generally increasing production by more than 10% compared to fields without ear fertilizer. This fertilization method must be widely promoted. Topdressing of ear fertilizer should be mainly nitrogen fertilizer, with an appropriate amount of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer. In addition to more topdressing and early topdressing, it is also necessary to emphasize skillful topdressing, that is, to apply fertilizer according to the field, the seedlings, and the weather, in order to apply the right medicine to the right disease and facilitate early maturity and high yield of late rice on a large area.

    Intertillage of late rice should be done early rather than late. Generally, two to three intertillages are appropriate. When the seedlings begin to tiller after surviving, step on the grass for the first time, implementing heavy stepping and deep stepping to bury the early rice stubble into the lower layer, reconcile the fertilizer, and promote rapid growth of new roots. After seven or eight days, step on the grass for the second time, this time the stepping should be shallow to prevent injury to the hills; for late transplanting, the method of grasping grass and moving mud should be adopted to avoid prolonging the tillering period. The third intertillage requires universal grasping of grass.

    Reasonable Irrigation to Promote Early Maturity of Late Rice

    From transplanting to harvesting of late rice, the temperature changes from high to low, and cold currents may be encountered in the later stages. Therefore, the depth of the irrigation water layer must be determined according to different climatic conditions and different growth and development stages. From transplanting to "greening," the temperature is high at this time, and deeper irrigation is appropriate; if the temperature turns high, in areas with sufficient water sources, the water can be changed once at noon to lower the soil temperature and allow the seedlings to green as early as possible at the most suitable temperature. However, lake fields and ditch-harbor reclaimed fields have lower soil temperatures, so it is advisable to keep shallow water. In order to root deeply and prevent lodging in the later stages, before and after the jointing stage, the fields should be drained and dried once or twice in combination with intertillage to increase soil air, promote the decomposition of organic fertilizer, allow the roots to go down, and prevent lodging; the drying time is generally three to four days. From the jointing of seedlings until the heading and flowering, it is a crucial period for the differentiation and formation of young ears, requiring more water. Because this is the period when the pistils and stamens are formed and the pollen is full, water cannot be lacking, otherwise fertilization will be affected. The heading stage of late rice is also when the temperature gradually decreases in September, and the temperature change is very large. Therefore, under normal weather conditions, shallow irrigation is advisable. If cold currents are encountered, deeper irrigation should be used to increase the soil temperature and maintain the plant temperature, which is beneficial for heading and flowering. From the flowering stage to the milk maturity stage, with the increase in the maturity of the seedlings, the water demand gradually decreases, and the temperature is lower than before. At this time, for seedlings growing well, they can naturally be drained to maintain a moist state; for seedlings growing poorly, a "skin" of water should still be maintained, and after the heads droop and the grains disperse, the field water should be completely drained.

    Fiercely Attack and Skillfully Combat to Eliminate Pests and Diseases Early

    According to the results of observations over the years, the most serious pests and diseases that harm late rice are rice borers, leafhoppers, rice leaf rollers, rice skipper and rice blast, etc. These pests and diseases are the "powerful enemies" of high-yield late rice. Last year, in a late rice field in our county farm, due to untimely spraying and few pest control treatments, dead heart seedlings accounted for more than 10% of the entire plant population; while a high-yield field in the County Institute of Agricultural Sciences was sprayed in a timely manner, resulting in dead heart seedlings accounting for only 0.1% of the entire plant population. From this, it can be seen that pests and diseases can be completely overcome through human efforts. The problem is definitely not the severity of the pests and diseases, but completely depends on artificial prevention and control.

    According to recent inspections in various places and the forecast of the county's pest and disease forecasting station, in the early and middle of August, the third generation of rice borers, in addition to harming a small number of late-maturing mid-season rice and early-transplanted first-crop late rice, are mainly distributed in early-transplanted late rice and late-transplanted first-crop late rice fields in the peak tillering period. During this period, the third peak of leafhoppers and the fourth generation of rice leaf rollers may also be encountered. In the early and middle of September, when the fourth generation of three-brood rice borers is prevalent, the late rice is in the booting and heading stage, which is the last and most important key to pest control and ensuring a bumper harvest of late rice. Because the peak hatching period of this generation of borer eggs is very long, plus the possible fourth peak of leafhoppers and the occurrence of panicle neck blast, therefore, for the prevention and control during this period, it is necessary to spray and kill in batches and categories according to the relationship between the occurrence of pests and diseases and the rice growth stage, with the main focus on protecting the panicles. In short, during the period of pest and disease occurrence, we should firmly grasp the key points according to the developmental characteristics of pests and diseases in each period, adopt technical strategies that combine disease and pest control, organize large-scale prevention and control battles, take unified action, carry out comprehensive suppression, fiercely attack and skillfully combat, and complete large-scale prevention and control tasks in a short period of time. In order to achieve the above goals, in terms of organization, all localities must establish, improve, and consolidate existing prevention and control organizations, strengthen the leadership of the Party, designate special personnel to be responsible, regularly go deep into the fields for inspection, accurately issue pest and disease information, and widely carry out mass pest and disease forecasting and reporting work, so that everyone knows the pest situation and everyone understands the technology. In terms of methods, the principle of "taking soil as the main, combining soil and foreign" should be adopted, and the effective experience of deep-water pest control should be widely promoted by using the convenient water source characteristics of the lake area.

    提高田间管理水平　坚决争取晚稻超早稻
    中共湖南南县委员会
    南县今年晚稻面积将扩大到四十五万亩左右，从目前来看，各项工作一般做得扎实，底肥多、质量好、犁耙工夫细致。在水利条件方面，自流排灌面积可达70％左右，非特大自然灾害，水旱无忧。特别是党加强了对农业生产的领导，加上广大干部工作作风有了进一步的改善，革命干劲更足，联系群众更好，为晚稻超早稻提供了有力保证。经过了连续两年大跃进，我们已经积累了晚稻超早稻的丰富经验，如华阁公社一万七千六百多亩晚稻，去年平均亩产五百二十多斤，比早稻增长4％。全县亩产八百斤以上的丘块有一万二千多亩，彻底地打破了晚稻不能超早稻的迷信。所有这一切，都为晚稻大面积丰收奠定了良好的基础。它不仅说明了晚稻超早稻的可能性，而且也说明了晚稻超早稻的可靠性。
    但是，我们也应当看到今年晚稻生产上的新情况和新问题：第一，今年的晚稻面积大（比去年多50％，比早稻多40％），培育管理的工作量随之增多，特别是新扩了很多晚稻田——湖荒甩亩、沟港挖压等，田间管理工作更是倍加复杂。第二，去年冬季气温高、冰雪少，害虫死亡率低，如螟虫死亡率就比1958年减低47％，因此，今年螟虫、浮尘子、稻苞虫等为害晚稻的可能性较去年增大。第三，晚稻底肥虽然一般较多，但分布不大平衡，还有10％的晚稻田严重的缺乏肥料。第四，由于早稻推迟了几天成熟期，部分晚稻秧龄达到了五十天以上，秆长叶茂，插下后如管理不当，容易倒伏，延长禾苗“回青期”。第五，插秧时间要比去年推迟几天。
    “田在人种，事在人为”。在争取晚稻大面积丰收的道路上，虽然存在着以上的一些困难，但这毕竟不是主要的。只要我们在党的领导下，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想红旗，充分地估计到我们的有利条件，也恰当地估计到某些困难条件，针对今年晚稻生长的新情况和新问题，坚决采取各种早熟高产措施，力争实现晚稻大面积高产，确实是完全可能的。在具体措施上，我们准备做好以下几条：
    及早查苗补蔸，闯过全苗关
    水稻单位面积产量的提高，是每亩总穗数和总粒数的增加，而总穗数的增加，首先必须保证有适当数量的本秧，依靠主穗，争取分蘖，达到穗多粒多的目的。麻河口公社千子红大队华红生产队第一作业组去年有一丘秋后四天插秧的旱秧田，由于密植4×7寸，每蔸插秧十二至十四根，结果每亩达到了二十五万苗，单产达到五百六十六斤。而相连一丘晚稻田，“立秋”前八天插秧，由于每蔸只插得五至七根，总苗数太少，结果单产仅五百二十斤，从这里来看，保证本秧有足够的根数，还是晚稻增产的重要一关，晚稻插下去以后，要立即组织力量，进行一次查苗、扶苗、补蔸工作，做到带秧逐丘检查，行行走到，边查边补、浮蔸扶正、缺蔸补蔸、蔸小增苗。
    合理追肥中耕，突破分蘖关
    争取更多的有效穗数，是晚稻增产的重要因素之一。据县农科所的试验分析，晚稻在分蘖期所需的肥料占全生育期的40％以上，所以分蘖的早迟和多少，与肥料的供应关系最为密切。育才公社爆破生产队第七作业组1959年有一丘三亩大的“湾八丘”用粳稻“松场261”良种，插秧后八天进行第一次中耕追肥，每亩施大粪五担，结合第二次中耕，每亩又追化肥七斤，由于做到了早中耕、早追肥，晚稻平均亩产量五百二十斤，比早稻增长25％。又因晚稻生长期长，加上粳稻需肥更多，因此并不像某些人所说的“晚稻不要粪，只要秋雨喷”那样，而必须施足底肥，并应多追肥、早追肥、巧追肥，特别是在今年晚稻较去年迟插几天的情况下，一定要积极地增施肥料，掌握早追原则，防止发生脱肥现象，以满足晚稻生长发育的需要，保证早熟高产。追肥宜结合中耕分次进行，一般追肥三次。晚稻活蔸后，及早追施分蘖肥，结合第一次中耕，每亩施用硫酸錏十至十五斤或腐熟了的人粪尿五至六担。实行稻草还原的田，一定要追施速效性肥料，接济需要。这次追肥后，对禾苗生长不好的而底肥又缺少的田应结合第二次中耕再追施一次分蘖肥，达到及早消灭三类禾，对禾苗生长较好，田底较肥或酸性较大的田，则应结合第二次中耕每亩打五、六十斤石灰。当晚稻拔节以后，幼穗分化和发育期间，施穗肥的效果极大，一般比不施穗肥的田要增产10％以上，必须普遍推广这种施肥办法。追穗肥以氮肥为主，适量配施磷钾肥。除多追肥、早追肥以外，还必须强调巧追肥，即要看田、看苗、看天追肥，作到对症下药，以利晚稻大面积早熟高产。
    晚稻中耕宜早不宜迟。一般以二至三次中耕为宜，禾苗活蔸开始分蘖时，踩第一次草，实行重踩、深踩，要把早稻禾蔸埋入下层，调和肥分，促使新根快长。相隔七、八天后，要踩第二次草，这次踩草宜浅，以防伤蔸；迟插的则采用抓草动泥方法，避免延长分蘖期。第三次中耕要求普遍抓草。
    合理灌溉，促使晚稻提早成熟
    晚稻从插秧到收获，气温由高到低，后期还可能遇到寒流。因此，灌溉水层的深浅，必须按照不同的气候条件和不同的生长发育阶段来决定。从插秧到“回青”，这时气温高，宜深灌一些；如温度转高，在部分水源充足的地区，中午可换水一次，降低泥温，使秧苗在最适宜的温度下，及早回青。但湖田甩亩、沟港挖压田，泥温较低，以留浅水为宜。为了扎根深、防止后期倒伏，在拔节前后，要结合中耕落水晒田一至二次，增加土壤空气，促使有机肥料分解，使根往下扎，防止倒伏；落干时间一般以三至四天为宜。禾苗拔节直到抽穗扬花，是幼穗分化和形成的关键时期，需水较多。因为这时正是雌雄蕊形成和花粉充实时期，不能缺水，否则影响受精，而晚稻抽穗时又正是气温逐渐下降的9月，气温变化很大。因此，在正常天气情况下宜浅灌，如遇寒流，要深灌一些，提高泥温，保持植株温度，对抽穗扬花有好处。扬花后到乳熟期，随着禾苗老熟程度的增加，需水量逐渐减少，而且气温较以往低。这时对禾苗生长良好的，可自然落干保持湿润状态；对禾苗生长差的，仍应保持一“皮”水，待低头散子后，即将田水完全放干。
    猛攻巧打，及早消灭病虫害
    根据历年观察结果，危害晚稻最严重的是螟虫、浮尘子、稻苞虫、稻纵卷叶虫和稻瘟病等。这些病虫害是晚稻丰产的“劲敌”。去年，我县农场有一丘晚稻田，因打药不及时，除虫次数少，枯心苗占整个株数的10％以上；而县农科所一丘丰产田打药适时，结果枯心苗仅占整个株数的0.1％。由此看来，病虫害是完全能够通过人的努力战胜的，问题绝不在于病虫害的严重程度，完全取决于人为的防治。
    近据各地检查及县病虫测报站的预报，8月上中旬，三代螟虫除危害少数迟熟中稻和早插一季晚稻外，主要是分布在分蘖盛期的早插晚稻和迟插一季晚稻田里。在这期间，还可能遇上浮尘子的第三次高峰和稻苞虫的第四代为害。9月上中旬，当四代三化螟盛发时，晚稻正处在孕穗和抽穗期，这是防治虫害、确保晚稻丰收的最后的也是最重要的一关。由于这一代螟卵的盛孵期拉得很长，加上可能遇上的浮尘子的第四次为害高峰和穗颈稻瘟的发生，因此，对于这一时期的防治，必须根据病虫害发生和水稻生育阶段的相互关系，以保穗为主，分批分类施药捕杀。总之，在病虫发生期间应根据各个时期病虫的发育特点，狠狠地抓住关键，采取病虫兼治的技术策略，组织大规模防治战役，统一行动，全面进剿，猛攻巧打，速战速决，在短时期内突击完成大面积防治任务。为达到以上目的，在组织上，各地要建立健全和巩固现有防治组织，加强党的领导，确定专人负责，经常深入田间检查，准确地发出病虫情报，并要广泛地开展群众性的病虫预测预报工作，做到人人知虫情，个个懂技术。在办法上则采取“以土为主，土洋结合”的方针，利用湖区水源方便的特点，普遍推行深水灭螟的有效经验。
