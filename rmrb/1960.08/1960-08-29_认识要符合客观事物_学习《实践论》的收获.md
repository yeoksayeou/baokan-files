    Understanding Must Conform to Objective Reality
    ——Gains from Studying "On Practice"
    Wu Yongqin, Purchasing Agent, Harbin Department Store

    Procurement is an important link in commodity circulation. It is crucial for promoting production, meeting needs, and boosting the market. Therefore, doing a good job in procurement is one of the important tasks of the commercial sector.

    How can we fulfill the task assigned to us by the Party? How can we satisfy the broad masses of consumers? In the past, I exerted a great deal of effort and spent a lot of brainpower, but I never managed to do the job well. After studying Chairman Mao's "On Practice," I found the key to solving this problem. Chairman Mao taught us: "If you want to know a certain phenomenon or a certain class of phenomena, you must participate in it and change it. You have to come into contact with it, that is, you have to practice in the environment of the phenomenon in order to solve it." Applying Chairman Mao's instructions to commercial work means constantly and repeatedly delving into the market, understanding the needs of industrial and agricultural production and the people's lives, understanding the social inventory situation, and understanding the changes in consumer needs caused by seasonal changes. The reason I didn't do a good job in purchasing in the past was because I was sitting in my room daydreaming. I didn't come into contact with the market, I didn't understand production and the needs of the people well, and I couldn't grasp the social inventory situation and seasonal changes.

    The work of a purchasing agent is to guide the work of purchasers through purchasing plans or temporary requisition orders. To formulate realistic and feasible purchasing plans, on the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen the research on the changes in supply and sales situations, find out the laws of supply and sales, so that the formulated plans are in line with objective reality; on the other hand, after the plans are formulated, they must be verified in practice and constantly revised so that they are consistent with objective reality.

    In the past, although we also made purchasing plans, we considered it finished after the plan was made, and we didn't think much about whether it was consistent with the market situation. Because of this, purchasing plans often did not match the market situation. After studying "On Practice," I understood that "it is seldom that men's forecasts are fulfilled to the letter. In the course of practice, people discover that their ideas, theories, plans or programmes are not fully realized." "Many times, it is only after repeated failures that men are able to correct wrong ideas, in correspondence with the laws of the objective process, and are able to arrive at the truth, convert subjective things into objective things, and consequently achieve the anticipated results in practice." According to Chairman Mao's instructions, I knew that after the plan was formulated, it had to be verified in practice to see if it was consistent with the market situation. If it was not consistent, it had to be revised. In this way, the purchasing plan can truly play the role of guiding purchasing work.

    However, production is constantly developing, and social needs are constantly changing. Especially in this era of the Great Leap Forward, where one day equals twenty years, the changes in supply and sales situations and the commodities themselves are very rapid. Old specifications and old designs of commodities are constantly being replaced by new commodities, and commodities that are out of stock today will be somewhat alleviated tomorrow. Commodities that were previously considered difficult to sell will now become generally needed commodities. For example: radios, watches, woolen clothes, etc., are like this. This requires purchasing agents to constantly delve into the market and better grasp the changes in supply and sales situations; otherwise, if the objective situation changes and our understanding does not keep up, subjective idealism errors will occur. For example: in early 1958, our company purchased more than 5,000 pairs of medical gloves from the Shanghai area; because it was in line with the development of health undertakings at that time, the market urgently needed these supplies, so they were quickly sold out. We mistakenly believed that this was a good-selling commodity, and in the second half of 1958, we purchased a large batch again. As a result, because rubber gloves are special products for the health department and cannot always be sold in large quantities, they had to be stockpiled.

    This fact tells us that human understanding must conform to the actual situation of the outside world in order to formulate correct plans. Therefore, in guiding purchasing work, we must change our understanding accordingly with the development of production and the needs of the market, and constantly revise and supplement our plans, so that purchasing work can truly play the role of supplying the market, meeting the ever-increasing needs of the people, and promoting the continuous leap forward of commercial work.

    认识要符合客观事物
    ——学习《实践论》的收获
    哈尔滨百货公司进货员　吴永琴
    采购工作是商品流通的重要环节，是促进生产、满足需要、繁荣市场的关键。因此，作好采购工作是商业部门的重要任务之一。
    怎样才能完成党交给我们的这个任务？怎样才能使广大消费者满意？从前我费了很大的劲，花了很多脑筋，可是总是没有把工作作好。学习了毛主席的《实践论》以后，我找到了解决这个问题的钥匙。毛主席教导我们说：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”把毛主席的指示运用到商业工作上，就是要经常反复地深入市场，了解工农业生产和人民生活的需要情况，了解社会的库存情况，了解由于季节的变化而引起的消费需要的变化。我过去没有把进货工作做好，就是因为坐在屋子里空想，没有接触市场，没有很好地了解生产和人民的需要，掌握不住社会库存的情况和季节的变化。
    进货员的工作，是通过采购计划或临时要货单来指导采购员的工作的。要想制定出切实可行的采购计划，一方面，要加强对供销情况变化的研究，找出供销的规律，使制定出来的计划，合于客观情况；另一方面，计划制定出来以后，要在实践中来验证，不断地修改它，使它和客观情况相一致。
    在过去，虽然也做进货计划，但是，计划做完以后就算完事了，它是不是和市场的情况一致，就不去多想。正因为这样，所以采购计划与市场的情况常常不一致。学习了《实践论》以后，我懂得了“不论在变革自然或变革社会的实践中，人们原定的思想、理论、计划、方案，毫无改变地实现出来的事，是很少的”。“许多时候须反复失败过多次，才能纠正错误的认识，才能到达于和客观过程的规律性相符合，因而才能够变主观的东西为客观的东西，即在实践中得到预想的结果”。根据毛主席的指示，我知道计划制定好以后，还要在实践中来验证它，看它和市场的情况是不是一致，不一致就要修改它。这样，才能使进货计划真正起到指导采购工作的作用。
    但是，生产是不断发展的，社会需要也是不断变化的。特别是在这一天等于二十年的大跃进的年代里，供销情况的变化、商品本身的变化都很快。旧规格旧花色的商品不断被新的商品代替，今天脱销的商品，明天就会有所缓和，过去被人认为难销的商品，现在就会变成普遍需要的商品。比如：收音机、手表、呢绒衣服等，就是这样。这就要求进货员必须不断深入市场，更好地掌握供销情况的变化；否则如果客观变化了，我们的认识跟不上去，就会出现主观主义的错误。比如：我们公司在1958年初，由上海地区购进医用手套五千多副；由于适合当时卫生事业的发展情况，市场迫切需要着这些用品，因而很快就销完了。我们便误认为这是好销的商品，1958年下半年又购进了一大批，结果，因为胶手套是卫生部门的专用品，不能老是大量销售，就只好积压起来。
    这一事实告诉我们，人的认识必须符合外界的实际情况，才能制定出正确的计划。因此，在指导采购工作中，必须随着生产的发展，市场的需求，相应地改变我们的认识，不断地修改和补充我们的计划，使采购工作真正起到供应市场，满足人民日益增长的需要，推动商业工作不断跃进的作用。
