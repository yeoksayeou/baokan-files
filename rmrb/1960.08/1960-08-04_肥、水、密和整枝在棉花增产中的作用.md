The cotton total output of our country in 1959 leaped to 48.2 million dan, an increase of 14.76% compared with 1958, completing the target of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. The characteristic of continuous bumper harvests is that many large-scale high-yield models have appeared in various places, further revealing the secret of the huge potential in cotton production.

After a series of socialist revolutionary movements on the political and ideological front, plant physiology workers have further clarified the great significance of theory must be linked to practice and scientific research must serve production. Over the past two years, we have gone deep into the countryside, under the leadership of the local Party committee, eating, living, working, and researching with the peasants, and humbly learning from the peasants. We deeply feel that the rich and profound scientific theories are hidden in the high-yield experiences created by the peasants, and we have personally seen the important role of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture in production. Comprehensively and systematically summarizing the experience in high cotton yields, and exploring the potential for increasing production, and solving existing problems are our important tasks at present. Based on our investigation and experiments in various cotton areas in 1959, and referring to relevant summaries and research data, we have made the following preliminary analysis of the role of fertilization, irrigation, dense planting, and pruning in increasing cotton production.

	Increase Fertilizer Application and Use Fertilizer Rationally

To achieve high cotton yields, we must first ensure that cotton plants continuously absorb the nutrients they need from the soil throughout the entire growth and development process. In this way, cotton plants can develop well, produce more bolls, and produce large bolls. Last year, the widespread increase in fertilizer application played a decisive role in ensuring large-scale bumper harvests in various places.

According to the results of fertilizer comparison experiments in various places in 1958 and 1959 and our large-scale survey and research, cotton fields with increased base fertilizer or top dressing all showed good plant growth, many fruit branches and fruit nodes, more buds and flowers with less shedding, more bolls with larger size and better quality, and significant yield increases.

The survey data listed in the Hebei Province Cotton Conference in October 1959 proved that under the same density, the yield per mu increased significantly with the increase of fertilizer application. In Xiaozhanggezhuang, Fengrun County, the yield of applying 8,000 jin of base fertilizer increased by 32.6% compared with applying 3,000 jin of base fertilizer; in Dachang Hanjiazhuang, Ji County, the yields of applying 10,000 jin and 8,000 jin of base fertilizer increased by 42.7% and 27.7% respectively compared with applying 3,000 jin of base fertilizer; in Chengguan Town, Zhuanghe, Tianjin, the yields of applying 40 jin and 20 jin of top dressing (ammonium sulfate) increased by 37.3% and 17.5% respectively compared with no top dressing.

Base fertilizer is generally dominated by organic fertilizer. Organic fertilizer is not only a complete fertilizer with a relatively stable fertilizer effect and a long duration of action, but also can improve the soil, promote the reproduction and activity of soil microorganisms, and have a good effect on controlling the early excessive growth of cotton plants and preventing premature senescence in the later stage.

According to the results of our comparison experiments on different base fertilizer dosages conducted in Liuying Village, Shijiazhuang, increasing the amount of base fertilizer not only increased the number of bolls per plant but also the number of bolls per mu, and the number of bolls in the middle and lower parts also increased with the increase of base fertilizer dosage.

Combining deep plowing, deep turning, and layered deep application of base fertilizer can increase the soil's ability to retain fertilizer and water. As the root system of cotton plants grows, if they can evenly absorb nutrients and water from different soil layers, it can avoid excessive growth of cotton plants caused by excessive fertilizer application or excessive concentration of fertilizer, and the effect will be more significant.

Cotton has a long growing period, and the effect of base fertilizer is slow. It is necessary to apply top dressing during a certain growth period to supplement the deficiency of base fertilizer. Generally speaking, in the case of insufficient base fertilizer, early top dressing is beneficial to increase production. If the top dressing is too late, the seedling stage will be delayed due to lack of nutrients, the vegetative body will be too small, and a large number of buds and bolls on the upper fruit branches and fruit branch tips will fall off. Although fertilizer is applied in the later stage, it is too late, and the effect is not as good as early application. In the case of sufficient base fertilizer, early top dressing should be controlled. On the basis of firmly establishing the pre-summer bolls, appropriately increasing top dressing in the mid and late stages can avoid excessive growth of cotton plants and reduce shedding. It is particularly worth pointing out that in the condition of fertile fields and dense planting, early top dressing must be more cautious. In the past, some high-yield experimental fields, due to excessive and rapid application of nitrogen fertilizer in the early stage, coupled with unreasonable irrigation, caused excessive growth of cotton plants, lush branches and leaves, and closure of the cotton fields; because the photosynthetic products in the cotton plants were small, and more were converted into nitrogen-containing compounds for vegetative growth, the nutrients required for bud and boll development could not be supplied normally and in time, causing a large number of buds and bolls on the middle and lower fruit branches to fall off, leading to reduced production.

On the other hand, in order to prevent cotton plants from aging prematurely and fully exploit the boll-forming potential in the later stage of cotton, according to the fertilization experience since 1958, appropriately applying nitrogen fertilizer before cotton boll opening can ensure the continuous growth of the vegetative body, the occurrence of new fruit nodes, and strive to produce more autumn bolls, increasing the number of bolls per plant. However, the later top dressing should be timely and appropriate. In the cotton areas of the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, the deadline for top dressing should not be later than mid-August. If the top dressing is too late, many ineffective buds and bolls will appear, and the effect will not be great.

In short, the principle of rational fertilization is to fully meet the nutrients needed for cotton plant growth and maximize the effect of fertilizer; to control the early excessive growth of cotton plants to reduce the shedding of buds and bolls on the middle and lower fruit branches, and to ensure the later growth of cotton plants to exploit the boll-forming potential. In large-scale production, the widespread and severe phenomenon of bud and boll shedding is not because of too much fertilizer, but because of lack of it. We believe that in large fields with insufficient base fertilizer and small amounts of top dressing, top dressing should be concentrated in the early stage of cotton plant growth. Because before and after budding, the growth potential of cotton plants is the strongest, and a small amount of fertilizer can exert the greatest effect, promoting cotton plants to have greater vegetative growth and creating material conditions for increasing production. In fertile fields with sufficient base fertilizer and large amounts of top dressing, the amount of top dressing in the early stage should be small, and most of the top dressing should be carried out in stages after the initial flowering, in order to control the early excessive growth of cotton plants, prevent the shedding of buds and bolls on the middle and lower fruit branches, and strive for higher and higher yields.

	Rational Irrigation to Ensure Increased Production

Cotton's demand for water varies in different growth stages due to changes in external environmental conditions and its own biological characteristics. The general trend is: less demand in the early stage, more demand in the middle stage, and less demand in the later stage. According to the historical cotton water consumption experiments of relevant agricultural research institutions across the country, the results are: the seedling stage accounts for 15% of the total water consumption, the budding stage accounts for 20%, the flowering and boll stage accounts for 45%, and the boll opening stage accounts for 20% (the numbers are approximate values).

By grasping the water demand law of cotton and combining it with the characteristics of meteorological conditions, timely irrigation can be carried out to maintain sufficient soil moisture to supply the needs of normal cotton growth.

In the cotton seedling stage, in normal years, after winter irrigation (or early spring irrigation), paying attention to moisture conservation, the water accumulated in the soil can meet the needs of cotton plants, and there is no need to carry out irrigation. Advanced cotton planters in the Yellow River Basin cotton area have put forward this view based on their rich production experience: irrigate enough water before sowing, and squat good seedlings before budding. This means that the soil moisture in the seedling stage should not be too high, and the time of the first irrigation should be appropriately postponed. This is the so-called "squatting seedling." The purpose of squatting seedlings is to control cotton plants from excessive early vegetative growth, leading to an imbalance between vegetative growth and reproductive growth later, to reduce bud and boll shedding. They advocate that the first irrigation should be carried out in the budding stage. Because in past years, this time is the spring drought period in the Northwest inland cotton area, and the rainfall in the Yellow River Basin cotton area is also less, and the volume of cotton plants is constantly increasing, affecting the increasing water consumption in the field, thus forming a soil moisture deficit, inhibiting the growth and development of cotton plants. Irrigation during the budding stage often has a significant effect on increasing production. Northern cotton farmers regard this irrigation as the key to cotton irrigation.

However, if drought occurs in the spring, the soil moisture in cotton fields in various places tends to be insufficient in the early stage of cotton growth. In this case, early "squatting seedlings" and the first irrigation in the budding stage are not effective measures. On the contrary, cotton fields that were irrigated early in the seedling stage have received good results: reduced shedding and increased yield. This has been confirmed by last year's experience.

The yield-increasing effect of timely first irrigation lies in producing more pre-summer bolls and summer bolls. The bolls set in these periods are early-maturing and of high quality, and are the most important component of yield. Therefore, whether the first irrigation can be done in a timely manner is a very important issue in cotton production.

After cotton flowering, it is the most important growth stage, the plant growth potential is the strongest, and a large number of buds and bolls are formed. This stage is long, the temperature is high, and the water demand of cotton plants is the greatest. In the Yangtze River Basin cotton area, it is the period of summer drought, so it is advisable to pay attention to timely irrigation to ensure summer bolls. In the Yellow River Basin cotton area, it is the rainy season, and irrigation should be particularly cautious, especially in cotton fields with medium or above fertility, which often cause excessive growth after irrigation and rain, and severe shedding in the middle and lower parts. This situation was very common in 1958. In July and August last year, the drought situation in cotton areas across the country increased unabated. Only by vigorously and diligently irrigating can cotton plants be helped to produce a large number of buds and flowers, thereby producing more bolls and larger bolls.

Correctly determining the cotton stopping irrigation period is also of great significance. Since the Great Leap Forward, cotton farmers have broken with convention, increased late top dressing, combined with irrigation, and strived for autumn bolls. It should be affirmed that this is an effective measure, manifested in the increase in the number of bolls per plant. However, this also needs to be mastered in time, and extending the post-irrigation period at will will not have the effect of increasing production. Inappropriate later irrigation not only has no benefit, but also causes adverse consequences: First, it delays the maturity of the existing green bolls in the middle and upper parts of the cotton plants and prevents them from opening and fluffing on time, so the pre-frost flowers are relatively reduced. On the surface, it seems that the total number of bolls has increased, but it is worth noting that the proportion of low-quality post-frost flowers also increases accordingly. Late irrigation of fertile fields must be more cautious. Second, even if the increase in the number of bolls in the upper part is won, it is often possible that due to the late time, this part of the boll is difficult to develop under the influence of the decreasing temperature, resulting in the softening of the boll shell and the failure of the fiber to form.

Farmers in the Yellow River Basin cotton area often irrigate cotton fields with small water ditches to moisten the soil when the cotton is opening and fluffing, which is called "fluffing water," and is regarded as an important measure to increase boll weight and improve quality. Of course, this depends on the specific situation (mainly soil moisture).

The amount of soil moisture in cotton fields directly affects the fertilizer effect. The rational combination of water and fertilizer is indeed a decisive factor in improving yield, but if used improperly, it will have the opposite effect. Generally, in large fields with insufficient fertilizer, attention should be paid to timely irrigation, and the effect of water should be used to ensure that the limited fertilizer is maximized, so that it is possible to turn low yield into high yield; as for high-yield areas, the water supply problem must be considered according to the principle of appropriately controlling the early growth of cotton plants and promoting later growth.
	Appropriately Increase Density to Fully Exploit the Potential for Increased Production

According to the results of the investigation of eighteen production teams, one farm, and eighty-eight cotton fields in Tianjin by the Hebei Province Cotton Conference in October last year, it is believed that the density of general medium-fertility cotton fields, such as reaching 5,000 to 6,000 plants per mu, can increase production by 47%-105% compared with 2,000 plants. Another survey of 195 cotton fields in Handan showed that under general management levels, cotton fields with a fertility of 15-20 jin/mu of pure nitrogen had the highest yield per mu at around 4,000 plants, cotton fields with a fertility of 10 jin/mu of pure nitrogen had the highest yield per mu at around 5,000 plants, and cotton fields with a fertility of 5 jin/mu of pure nitrogen had the highest yield per mu at around 6,000 plants. In fact, the density of most types of cotton fields last year was lower than the cotton field density with the highest yield, indicating that the general cotton fields last year were planted too sparsely. Taking Shijiazhuang suburbs and the eastern eight counties as an example, there are very few that reach 3,500 plants per mu, and most are around 2,000 to 2,500 plants. It is generally reflected that cotton production increased last year, but there was a loss in density. The reasons for the sparse density can be summarized into two: one is technical, due to extensive cultivation and management, the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges is common; the other is ideological, attributing the consequences of excessive growth of cotton plants, closure of cotton fields, and severe shedding caused by improper water and fertilizer measures in a few densely planted high-yield experimental fields in the past to dense planting, so the density was consciously reduced.

Over the past year, production practice has once again proved that rational dense planting is one of the key measures to improve the yield per unit area. As everyone knows, cotton yield per mu is determined by the product of yield per plant and the number of plants per mu. In order to increase yield, the yield per plant must be high, and the number of plants per mu must be large, so that both the individual production potential and the group productivity can be maximized. There is a contradictory and unified relationship between the individual and the group. According to the results of our density comparison experiments, the number of bolls per plant decreases with the increase of density. After the density increases, the individual productivity is limited to a certain extent, and the group productivity is improved under certain conditions. This condition is: the group productivity increased by increasing the number of plants is greater than the individual productivity (sum) decreased by increasing the number of plants. It can be seen that the basis for dense planting to increase production lies in: both to exploit individual productivity and to fully exploit group productivity.

Starting from this, we believe that there are two different ways to solve the problem of dense planting and increased production. One is to adopt the most suitable density at present, improve the management level, increase the number of bolls per plant, and further increase the yield per mu. The other is to appropriately increase the density, and through reasonable measures, ensure that individuals have considerable productivity, and fully exploit group productivity, so that the yield per mu is further increased.

The principle of arranging density according to the fertility level of cotton fields is: for fertile fields, the density should be smaller, and for less fertile fields, the density should be appropriately increased. According to the leaf area results measured in cotton fields in various places, the leaf area coefficient of cotton fields with poor fertility is still low. It is estimated that in the short term, when fertilizers cannot be increased significantly, increasing density is still an important link in increasing production at present. Because only by appropriately increasing the number of plants can a considerable leaf area be guaranteed, fully utilizing solar energy and exerting group productivity. In cotton fields with greater fertility, the arrangement of density should still not be too low. In recent years, the density of high-yield experimental fields that have achieved high yields has not been less than 3,000 plants. Everyone is very clear that in high-fertility and sparsely planted cotton fields, although every cotton plant grows into a "cotton king," the yield per mu is not high. The reason is that individual productivity is exerted, but group productivity is limited. High-fertility and densely planted cotton fields are prone to excessive growth of cotton plants. If management measures are appropriate, the yield can greatly break through the thousand-jin mark. Last year, Zhang Qiuxiang's experimental field had a density of more than 4,000 plants, the amount of fertilizer applied was also large, the number of bolls per plant was 18.6, and the yield per mu was one of the highest in the country. With the progress of national industrialization, the number of synthetic fertilizers increases, and the fertility level of cotton fields continues to increase. Under such circumstances, how to continuously improve the rationality of dense planting to facilitate the continuous leap forward in yield per mu is a major task before us.

In order to solve this task, we must first understand the essence of the contradiction between individuals and groups under dense planting conditions, as well as the main reasons for the contradiction, and then we can take effective agricultural measures.

The dry weight of crops is composed of 90%-95% of organic matter, and photosynthesis is the source of these organic matter, and plants mainly rely on leaves to carry out photosynthesis. Increasing density can increase the leaf area coefficient (referring to the ratio of the total area of plant leaves to the land area on a unit land area), so that solar energy can be more fully utilized and more organic matter can be produced, providing the possibility for increasing crop production.

According to the results of the density comparison experiments conducted by us and the Hebei Cotton Research Institute, under the same cultivation conditions, with the increase of density, the leaf area coefficient of cotton plants increases, and at the same time, the dry weight of the aboveground part of plants per mu also increases, which is beneficial to increase production. However, due to the increase of the leaf area coefficient, the light below the plants is weakened, and photosynthesis is inevitably affected. The consequence is that the amount of dry matter produced and accumulated by the leaves per unit area in a certain period of time (usually called photosynthetic productivity) decreases accordingly.

If the density is too large and the photosynthetic productivity is too low, the organic matter accumulated by plants on each mu of land will no longer have greater growth. More importantly, with the increase of density, there are significant differences in the places where the organic matter produced by plants is distributed. If the density is too large, more and more organic matter is distributed in the vegetative organs than in the reproductive organs, and the yield of seed cotton per plant is correspondingly weakened, which finally affects the yield of seed cotton per mu. We have seen that some cotton fields with sufficient fertility and excessive density, due to improper water and fertilizer measures, cause excessive growth of cotton plants, and a large number of buds and bolls in the middle and lower fruit branches fall off, precisely because too much organic nutrients are consumed in vegetative growth and cannot be supplied to the needs of buds and bolls in time and fully, resulting in a low yield of seed cotton.

It seems that the main contradiction between individuals and groups after dense planting lies in whether the size of the leaf area of the cotton plant itself is appropriate. The commonly referred to "ventilation and light transmission" problem is caused by excessive leaf area. The way to solve "ventilation and light transmission" should be explored from controlling the growth of cotton plants. The main means is to rationally use fertilizer and water to control the growth of cotton plants. As mentioned earlier, controlling vegetative growth in the early stage is even more strict in the case of increased density. In the later stage, both growth must be promoted but not too much. The principle is to obtain the maximum reproductive growth on the smallest vegetative body. The specific methods vary depending on the specific situation. In cotton fields with large fertility and sufficient base fertilizer, less top dressing or no top dressing in the early stage is appropriate, and then timely and appropriately increase flower and boll fertilizer after the pre-summer bolls are set. In lean fields or cotton fields with insufficient base fertilizer, appropriate top dressing should still be applied in the early stage to ensure a certain amount of vegetative growth and lay the foundation for reproductive growth.

	Fine Pruning to Strive for More Bolls, Larger Bolls, and Better Quality

Pruning is a unique technical measure in cotton field management. Through it, not only can the microclimate in the field be changed, but also the transport and distribution of organic nutrients in the cotton plant can be controlled, and the vegetative growth and reproductive growth of the cotton plant can be effectively regulated to strive for more bolls, larger bolls, and better quality.

Topping is the most important part of pruning technology. From the perspective of cotton physiology, cotton plants have apical dominance. The organic nutrients synthesized by the leaves first meet the growth of the top of the main stem, and then supply the excess to the growth and development of other parts. Therefore, at an appropriate time, topping measures can be used to adjust the transport of substances in the body, so that it turns to the fruiting organs, which is conducive to producing more bolls, increasing boll weight, and increasing yield. We have used isotope C14 to detect the direction of material transport in topped and non-topped cotton plants, which proves this point.

The yield-increasing effect of topping is certain, and the key lies in whether the topping time is grasped appropriately. We believe that the topping time is mainly determined by two factors: the level of fertilizer and the change of temperature. Taking fertilizer as an example, it can be divided into two situations: if the cotton field is short of fertilizer and cannot meet the needs of the plant in the later stage, it is appropriate to top early in a timely manner; on the contrary, in the case of more fertilizer, topping can be appropriately delayed to strive for more autumn bolls, which is beneficial to increase production. Topping too early will inevitably reduce the number of effective bolls, and topping too late will cause ineffective consumption of nutrients, increase shedding, reduce boll weight, and late maturity. In addition, topping should also be determined according to temperature conditions, because in the later stage of cotton plant growth, the young bolls and flower buds on the upper fruit branches cannot develop under low temperature conditions, and they will wither and fall off. At the same time, the growing point cannot continue to divide and produce fruit branches and buds due to low temperature damage, and the plant growth potential will stop on its own, so topping too late will only consume nutrients. The topping time in each region should be different. We believe that under the principle of striving for autumn bolls and promoting early maturity, the early frost in the Yellow River Basin is in late October, and the topping time should generally not be later than the beginning of autumn; the frost-free period in the Yangtze River Basin is longer, and it can be appropriately postponed.

In addition, in terms of pruning work, removing leaf branches, wiping away superfluous buds, removing old leaves, and removing group tips are also important links in controlling the growth and development of cotton plants and regulating the transport and utilization of organic nutrients. Removing leaf branches is generally carried out after the first fruit branch shows buds. Some people advocate not removing leaf branches to exploit their production potential and nutritional effects, but in reality, the number of bolls on the leaf branches themselves is very small, and the impact on yield is insignificant. As for the nutritional effect of leaf branches, according to our 1959 data on the transport and distribution of carbon assimilation substances using isotope C14, the nutritional effect of leaf branches on cotton plants is also very small. Because leaf branches themselves also have apical dominance, after the cotton field is closed, the leaf branches will grow excessively, but will compete with buds and bolls for nutrients, increasing shedding, resulting in more harm than good. Removing superfluous buds can save nutrient consumption and promote the growth of the main stem and fruit branches. Especially in fertile cotton fields, superfluous buds are prone to occur and should be wiped away at any time. Timely and appropriate removal of old leaves has the effect of improving light conditions in cotton fields and controlling the rapid growth of the main stem. In vigorously growing cotton fields, the old leaves in the middle and lower parts of cotton plants are under extremely weak light, and the photosynthetic intensity is reduced, which not only cannot supply nutrients to cotton plants, but also becomes a burden to cotton plants. Timely and appropriate removal of some old leaves is beneficial to increasing boll formation and preventing boll rot. However, the removal of old leaves must be measured. In general cotton fields, it is appropriate to remove less in fields with low closure to ensure that cotton plants have a considerable leaf area and exert its nutritional effect; in excessively growing and closed cotton fields, the substances assimilated by the old leaves of the main stem during the flowering period are mainly transported to the vigorous vegetative growth part, thus further promoting the excessive growth of cotton plants. In this case, the old leaves in the middle and lower parts can be appropriately removed. Removing group tips is also a problem that deserves attention. In cotton fields with poor fertility, its importance is not great, but in cotton fields with sufficient fertilizer and vigorous cotton plant growth, it has a certain effect. Experiments have proved that after removing group tips, not only the number of bolls per plant increases and shedding is reduced to some extent, but also the transport direction of organic matter in the plant is changed, more satisfying the boll formation needs of the middle and upper parts of the cotton plant.

    肥、水、密和整枝在棉花增产中的作用	中国科学院石家庄棉花工作队
    1959年我国棉花总产量跃增到四千八百二十万担，比1958年增长14.76％，提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的指标。连续丰收的特点是，各地出现了许多大面积丰产典型，从而进一步揭开了棉花生产上巨大潜力的秘密。
    植物生理学工作者经过一系列的政治思想战线上的社会主义革命运动，进一步明确了理论必须联系实际、科学研究必须为生产服务的重大意义。两年来，我们深入农村，在当地党委领导下，与农民同吃，同住，同劳动，同研究，并虚心向农民学习。我们深深体会到农民所创造的丰产经验中蕴藏着丰富而高深的科学理论，并亲眼看到农业“八字宪法”在生产中所起的重大作用。全面系统地总结棉花高产中的经验，并发掘增产的潜力，解决存在的问题，是我们当前重要的工作。我们根据1959年在各棉区的调查和试验，并参考有关的总结和研究资料，对施肥、灌溉、密植和整枝在棉花增产中的作用，作了下列的初步分析。
            增施肥料　合理用肥
    要使棉花获得高产，首先必须使棉株在整个生长发育过程中，不断地从土壤中吸收所需要的养料。这样，棉株才能发棵良好，多结铃，结大铃。去年各地由于普遍增施肥料，在保证大面积丰产上起着决定性的作用。
    根据1958年、1959年各地的肥料对比试验和我们进行的大面积调查研究的结果，增施基肥或增施追肥的棉田，都是棉株生长良好，果枝果节多，蕾多花多脱落少，铃多铃大品质好，增产效果显著。
    从1959年10月河北省棉花会议所列举的调查资料证明，在密度相同的情况下，亩产量随施肥量增加而显著提高。丰润县小张各庄施基肥八千斤的比施基肥三千斤的增产32.6％；蓟县大厂韩家庄施基肥一万斤、八千斤的比施基肥三千斤的分别增产42.7％、27.7％；天津庄河城关镇追肥四十斤（硫酸铵）、二十斤的比不追肥的分别增产37.3％、17.5％。
    基肥一般以有机肥为主。有机肥不但是一种完全肥料，肥效发挥比较平稳，起作用的时间长，而且能够改良土壤、促进土壤微生物的繁殖及活动，对控制棉株前期徒长和防止后期早衰都有良好作用。
    根据我们在石家庄留营村所进行的不同基肥用量对比试验的结果看来，增施基肥不仅单株成铃高亩铃数亦较多，而且中下部结铃数也随着基肥用量的增加而增加。
    结合深耕深翻分层深施基肥，可以增加土壤的容肥保水的能力。随着棉株根系的生长，如能从不同土层中均匀地吸收养料和水分，可以避免由于增施肥料或由于肥料过于集中所引起的棉株徒长，效果就更为显著。
    棉花生长期长，基肥的肥效缓慢，在一定的生育期间进行追肥以补基肥之不足是十分必要的。一般来说，在基肥用量不甚充裕的情况下，提早追肥有利于增产。如果追肥过晚，苗期由于养料缺乏，延迟了发育，营养体过于矮小，上部果枝及果枝末稍的蕾铃将大量脱落，虽然后期增施肥料，但为时过晚，效果不如早施的大。在基肥充足的情况下，就应该控制早期追肥，在坐稳伏前桃的基础上，中后期再适当增施追肥，可以避免棉株徒长，减少脱落。特别值得指出的是，在肥田密植的条件下，前期追肥更须慎重。过去曾有部分高额丰产试验田，由于前期追施氮肥过多过猛，加以灌水又不合理，造成棉株徒长，枝叶茂盛，棉田郁闭；棉株体内由于光合作用的产物少，又较多地转化为含氮化合物运用于营养生长，使蕾铃发育所需的养料，得不到正常的及时的供应，引起中下部果枝上的蕾铃大量脱落，导致减产。
    另一方面，为了防止棉株过早衰老，充分发挥棉花后期的结铃潜力，根据1958年以来的施肥经验，在棉花开絮之前适当追施氮肥，可以保证营养体不断生长，发生新的果节，争取多结秋桃，增加单株成铃。但是后期追肥应当适时适量，黄河及长江流域棉区，追肥截止时期以不迟于8月中旬为宜，追肥过晚，出现许多无效蕾铃，效果不大。
    总之，合理施肥的原则，是既要充分满足棉株生育所需要的养料，又要最大限度发挥肥料的效果；既要控制棉株前期的徒长，以减少中下部果枝上的蕾铃脱落，又要保证棉株后期发棵，以发挥结铃的潜力。在大面积的生产上，普遍而严重的蕾铃脱落现象，不是因为肥料过多，而是由于缺少。我们认为基肥不足而追肥用量又不多的大田，追肥应当集中使用于棉株生长前期。因为在现蕾前后，棉株生长势最强，少量的用肥，可以发挥最大的效力，促使棉株有较大的营养生长，为增产创造物质条件。在基肥充足而追肥用量较大的丰产田，前期追肥量宜少，大部分追肥在初花以后分次进行，以便控制棉株的初期徒长，防止中下部果枝上蕾铃的脱落，争取高产更高产。
          合理灌溉　保证增产
    棉花对水分的需求，由于外界环境条件的变化和自身的生物学特性，各个生育时期各不相同。总的趋势是：前期需要量少，中期需要多，后期需要量又较少。根据全国各地有关农业研究机关历年来的棉花耗水量试验，结果是：幼苗期占总耗水量的15％，蕾期占20％，花铃期占45％，吐絮期占20％（数字都是近似值）。
    掌握了棉花的需水规律，结合气象条件的特点，就可以适时灌水，保持土壤有足够的水分，供给棉花正常生长的需要。
    在棉花苗期，按平常年份来说，在冬灌（或早春灌）以后，注意保墒，土壤里所积贮的水分可以满足棉株的需要，不必进行灌水。黄河流域棉区的先进植棉者，根据自己的丰富生产经验，提出了这样看法：播前灌足水，蕾前蹲好苗。意即苗期土壤水分不宜很大，适当推迟头水的时间，这就是所谓“蹲苗”。蹲苗的目的在于控制棉株不因早期营养生长过盛，导致后来营养生长与生殖生长的失调，以减少蕾铃脱落。他们主张头水应当在蕾期进行。因为历年这时在西北内陆棉区正值春旱，黄河流域棉区的雨量也较少，而棉株体积又不断增大，影响到田间耗水量日益增多，这样就形成土壤水分亏缺，抑制棉株生长发育。蕾期灌水往往增产效果显著。北方棉农把这一次水当作棉花灌溉中的关键。
    但是，如果春季就发生干旱，各地棉田土壤水分在棉花生长初期就有供应不足的趋向，在这种情况下，早期“蹲苗”蕾期头水就不是行之有效的措施。恰恰相反，凡是提前在苗期灌水的棉田，都收到良好的效果：脱落减少，产量增加。这是去年的经验所证实的。
    适时进行头水的增产作用，在于多座伏前桃和伏桃，在这些时期座住的桃早熟质优，又是产量中最重要的组成部分。所以，头水能否做到适时，是棉花生产上一个很重要的问题。
    棉花开花以后，是最重要的生育时期，植株生长势最强，蕾铃大量形成。这一阶段，时间长，气温高，棉株需水量最多。在长江流域棉区正值伏旱，宜注意及时灌溉，确保伏桃，黄河流域棉区，正当多雨季节，灌水应特别慎重，尤其是肥力中等以上的棉田，往往因灌水后遇雨，造成徒长，中下部脱落严重。这种情况1958年很为普遍。去年7、8月间，全国各地棉区，旱情有增无减，只有大力勤灌，才有助于棉株大量现蕾开花，从而多结铃，结大铃。
    正确地确定棉花停灌期，同样具有重大意义。大跃进以来，棉农打破陈规，增加后期追肥，结合灌水，力争秋桃。应该肯定，这是行之有效的措施，表现在单株成铃数有所增加。但是，这也要掌握得时，不是随便延长后水期，都会有增产效果的。后期灌水不适当，不但没有益处，反而引起不良后果：一、使得棉株中上部已有的青铃延迟成熟、不能按时吐絮，因而霜前花相对地减少。表面上看来，总铃数是增加了，但是值得注意的是，品质低劣的霜后花所占的比例也就随之增多。对于肥田后期灌水更须慎重。二、即使赢得了上部成铃数的增多，常有可能因时间过晚，在气温日益降低的影响下，这一部分铃也很难发育，致铃壳软化，纤维不能形成。
    黄河流域棉区农民常在棉花吐絮之际，以小水沟灌湿润棉田，称之为“吐絮水”，被当作为增加铃重、提高品质的一项重要措施。当然这要看具体情况（主要是土壤湿度）决定。
    棉田土壤水分的多少，直接影响到肥效的发挥。水、肥配合得合理，固然是提高产量决定性的因素，如果运用不当，也会发生相反的作用。一般肥料不足的大田，应注意及时灌水，借水分的作用保证有限的肥料得到最大的发挥，才有变低产为高产的可能；至于丰产片，必须根据适当控制棉株的前期生长，促进后期发棵这一原则来考虑供水问题。	  适当增加密度　充分发挥增产潜力
    据去年10月河北省棉花会议考察天津市十八个生产队、一个农场、八十八块棉田的结果，认为一般中等肥力棉田的密度，如达到每亩五千至六千株时，可以比二千株增产47％—105％。另调查邯郸一百九十五块棉田结果，在一般的管理水平下，肥力在纯氮十五—二十斤／亩的棉田以四千株左右的亩产量最高，肥力在纯氮十斤／亩棉田以五千株左右的亩产量最高，肥力在纯氮五斤／亩棉田以六千株左右的亩产量最高。实际上，去年各类棉田的密度绝大多数都低于最高产量的棉田密度，说明去年一般棉田是种得偏稀的。以石家庄市郊和东八县而言，很少有每亩达到三千五百株的，绝大多数在二千至二千五百株左右。普遍反映，去年棉花增了产，但是在密度上吃了亏。密度偏稀的原因，归纳起来是两个，一是技术上的，由于耕作管理粗放，缺苗断垅现象普遍；另一个是思想上的，把过去少数密植丰产试验田因水、肥措施不当而引起的棉株徒长，棉田郁闭，脱落严重的后果，都归咎于密植，所以有意识地将密度降低了。
    一年来，生产实践再一次证明了合理密植是提高单位面积产量的关键性措施之一。大家知道，棉花亩产量决定于单株产量与每亩株数的乘积。为了提高产量，单株产量要高，每亩株数要多，既发挥个体生产潜力，又要使群体生产力得到最大的发挥。个体与群体之间，存在着矛盾统一的关系。根据我们的密度对比试验的结果，单株成铃数随密度增加而减少，密度增加后个体生产力受到一定的限制，群体生产力在一定条件下得到提高。这个条件是：由增加植株数而增加的群体生产力大于因为增加植株数而减低的个体生产力（总和）。由此可见，密植增产的基础在于：既要发挥个体生产力，又要充分发挥群体生产力。
    由此出发，我们认为解决密植增产问题，可以有两个不同的途径。一个是采用目前最适宜的密度，提高管理水平，增加单株成铃，使亩产量进一步提高。另一个是适当增大密度，通过合理措施，保证个体在有相当的生产力条件下，充分发挥群体生产力，使亩产进一步提高。
    按照棉田肥力水平来安排密度的原则是：肥大的，密度应小些，肥小的，密度应适当增高。根据我们在各地棉田测定叶面积结果来看，目前肥力较差的棉田，叶面积系数还是较低，估计在短期内肥料还不能大量增加的情况下，提高密度仍然是当前增产的重要环节。因为只有适当增加株数，才能保证有相当的叶面积，充分利用日光能，发挥群体生产力。在肥力较大的棉田，密度的安排仍然不宜过低。近几年来获得高产的丰产试验田，密度没有在三千株以下的。大家都很清楚，高肥稀植的棉田，尽管棵棵棉株长成“棉花王”，可是亩产量并不高，原因是个体生产力是发挥了，但群体生产力却受到限制。高肥密植棉田，容易引起棉株徒长，如果管理措施得当，产量可以大大突破千斤大关。去年张秋香试验田密度高达四千余株，施肥量也不少，单株成铃十八点六个，亩产量为全国最高之一。随着国家工业化的进展，合成化肥增多，棉田肥力水平不断提高，在这样的情况下，如何不断地提高密植的合理程度，以利于亩产量不断跃进，是摆在我们面前的重大任务。
    为了解决这个任务，首先必须弄清楚密植条件下个体与群体的矛盾的实质，以及产生矛盾的主要原因，然后才能采取有效的农业措施。
    农作物的干物重90％—95％是由有机物质构成的，光合作用是产生这些有机物质的泉源，而植物进行光合作用主要依靠叶片。增加密度能使叶面积系数（指单位土地面积上植株叶片总面积与土地面积的比值）增大，这样就可以更充分地利用日光能，生产出更多的有机物质，为作物的增产提供可能。
    根据我们与河北棉花研究所所进行的密度对比试验结果表明，在同一栽培条件下随着密度增大，棉株的叶面积系数增加，同时，每亩植株地上部干物重也增加，这是有利于增产的一面。但是，由于叶面积系数增大后，株间下方光照减弱，光合作用必然受到影响，其后果是单位面积的叶片在一定时间内所制造和累积干物质的数量（通常称为光合生产率）随之降低。
    密度过大，光合生产率过低，就会引起每亩土地上植株所累积的有机物质不再有更大的增长。更重要的是，随着密度的增大，植株所制造的有机物质分布的地方有显著的差异，密度过大，有机物质分布在营养器官比分布在生殖器官的愈来愈多，单株籽棉产量相应的被削弱，终于影响到每亩籽棉的产量。我们看到，某些肥力较足，密度过大的棉田，由于水、肥措施不当而造成棉株徒长，中下部果枝蕾铃大量脱落，正是因为有机养料过多的消耗于营养生长，不能及时而充分地供应蕾铃的需要所引起的，结果籽棉产量并不高。
    看来，密植后个体与群体的主要矛盾，在于棉株本身叶面积的大小是否合适。通常所称“通风透光”问题即由叶面积过大而产生的。解决“通风透光”的途径，应该是从控制棉株生长去探讨，主要的手段是合理使用肥水，控制棉株生长。正如前面所谈的那样，前期控制营养生长，在密度增大的情况下要求更加严格，后期既要发棵但又不能过大，原则是在最小的营养体上获得最大的生殖生长。具体办法视具体情况而定，肥力大基肥足的棉田，前期少追肥或不追肥，在座住伏前桃后再适时适量地增施花铃肥，而在瘦田或基肥不充足的棉田，前期仍应适当追肥，以保证一定的营养生长，为生殖生长奠定基础。
    精细整枝　争取桃多桃大品质好
    整枝是棉田管理特有的一项技术措施，通过它不仅可以改变田间小气候，并且可以控制棉株体内有机养料的运输和分配，有效地调节棉株的营养生长和生殖生长，争取桃多、桃大、品质好。
    打顶是整枝技术中最重要的一环。从棉花生理来看，棉株具有顶端优势，叶片所合成的有机养料首先满足主茎顶端的生长，而后才把多余的供给其它部分的生长发育。因此，在适当时期可借打顶的措施，以调节体内物质运输，使其转向结实器官，有利于多结铃，增加铃重，提高产量。我们曾用同位素C14探测打顶与不打顶的棉株体内物质运输方向，证明了这一点。
    打顶的增产作用是肯定的，关键在于打顶时间掌握得是否合适。我们认为，打顶时期主要决定于两个因素：肥料的水平和气温的变化。拿肥料来说，可分两种情况：如果棉田缺肥，不能满足植株后期的需要，以适时早打顶为宜，相反，在多肥的情况下，打顶适当地推迟，可争取多结秋桃，有利于增产。过早打顶，必然减少有效铃数，过晚则造成养料的无效消耗，增加脱落，减低铃重，晚熟。此外，打顶还要视气温条件而定，因为到了棉株生长后期，上部果枝的幼铃花蕾，在低温条件下，不能发育，即行干瘪脱落。同时生长点因受低温伤害，也不能继续分生果枝和现蕾，植株生长势自行停滞，因而过晚打顶，徒然消耗养料。各地区的打顶时期应该有所不同。我们认为，在力争秋桃和促进早熟的原则下，黄河流域早霜在10月下旬，打顶时期一般不应迟于立秋；长江流域无霜期较长，可以适当推迟。
    此外，在整枝工作方面，去叶枝，抹赘芽，打老叶，去群尖等也是控制棉株生长发育，调节有机养料的运输和利用的重要环节。去叶枝一般是在第一果枝上现蕾后进行，有人主张不去叶枝，以发挥其生产潜力和营养作用，但实际上，叶枝本身的结铃数很少，对产量的影响无足轻重。至于叶枝的营养作用，根据我们1959年利用同位素C14研究碳素同化物质的运输和分配的资料证明，叶枝对棉株的营养作用也是很小的。因为叶枝本身也具有顶端优势，在棉田封行后，由于叶枝徒长，反而会与蕾铃争夺养料，增加脱落，以致得不偿失。去赘芽可以节省养料的消耗，促进主茎和果枝的生长。特别是在土壤肥沃的棉田里，容易发生赘芽，应随时抹去。及时而适当地打老叶有改善棉田光照条件和控制主茎猛长的作用。生长旺盛的棉田，棉株中、下部老叶处于极端微弱的光照之下，光合强度减低，不仅不能供给棉株的营养，反而成为棉株的负担。适时适当打掉些老叶，对增加成铃，防止烂铃是有好处的。但是打老叶要有分寸，在一般棉田里，郁闭度不大的宜少打，以保证棉株有相当的叶面积，发挥它的营养作用；在徒长郁闭的棉田里，盛花时期主茎的老叶所同化的物质主要运输方向是朝着旺盛的营养生长部分，因此更加促使棉株的徒长，在这种情况下，可适当地打去中下部的老叶。去群尖也是一个值得重视的问题，在肥力较差的棉田里，其重要性不大，但在肥料充足，棉株生长旺盛的棉田中，它是有一定作用的。试验证明：去群尖后，不仅单株成铃数增加，脱落有所减少，而且改变了植株体内有机物质的运输方向，较多地满足了棉株中上部结铃的需要。
