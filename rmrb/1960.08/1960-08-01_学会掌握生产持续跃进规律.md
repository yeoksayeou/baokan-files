    Learn to Master the Laws of Continuous Production Leaps Forward

    From the beginning of the Great Leap Forward to the continuous Great Leap Forward, this is a process of development. Now, some factories and mines have begun to find and gradually master the laws of continuous production leaps forward, resulting in a larger and better comprehensive continuous leap forward. The task before us is to earnestly study the experiences of advanced units and earnestly summarize our own experiences, so as to find out how to gradually learn to master the laws of continuous production leaps forward and better organize the continuous Great Leap Forward in production.

    The reason why the Hebi Coal Mine has been able to achieve brilliant achievements in the continuous leap forward is not only because they have a spirit of striving for the upstream, a spirit of continuous revolution, but also because they have touched the laws of continuous production leaps forward in organizing the continuous leap forward, and they have begun to learn to master and apply this law to serve production.

    Why can the Hebi Coal Mine recognize and master the laws of continuous production leaps forward relatively quickly? What we see first is the decisive significance of putting politics in command and ideology first. Under the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, in the practice of struggle, the Hebi Coal Mine gradually formed the guiding ideology of "self-reliance, always striving for the upstream, rushing forward in everything, and striving for initiative step by step." This guiding ideology has become a huge material force, enabling them to correctly handle various contradictions that arise in the Great Leap Forward, thereby greatly accelerating the process of recognizing and mastering the laws of continuous production leaps forward. Constantly and correctly resolving various contradictions is the most central link in adhering to the continuous leap forward. Contradiction is the driving force of the development of things. It is unrealistic and impossible to dare not face contradictions and hope to avoid contradictions and move forward. Taking a passive balancing attitude in the face of contradictions will also hinder the development of productive forces. Therefore, we must learn to analyze contradictions, master the laws of contradictions, actively discover contradictions, and take the initiative to solve contradictions. There are many contradictions within each thing. Within a coal mine, there are contradictions between coal mining, tunneling, transportation, electromechanical, and supply. From the current complex contradictory phenomena, we must find the main contradictions, because the existence and development of the main contradictions stipulate and affect the existence and development of other contradictions. In coal mines, the main contradiction is usually the contradiction between coal mining and tunneling. Tunneling lagging behind coal extraction is a phenomenon that has existed in many coal mines for a long time. Due to the continuous revolution in coal mining methods and the rapid growth of production, the contradiction between coal mining and tunneling has become more prominent. This is a major issue that affects the overall situation. The way the Hebi Coal Mine solved this contradiction was to "grasp both." We criticized the method of passively balancing coal mining and tunneling by reducing production, and adopted the method of grasping high production on the one hand and grasping tunneling on the other hand, and closely relying on the masses, making a big fuss about technical revolution, establishing benchmarks, and vigorously promoting the rapid tunneling experience of the Qihezhi tunneling team. In this way, tunneling caught up with the requirements of coal mining. Now, due to the vigorous strengthening of tunneling work, the Hebi Coal Mine has more than six months of coal volume. They decided to maintain this ratio and adopted the method of using two tunneling faces to ensure one extraction face, or three tunneling faces to ensure two extraction faces. In this way, they won the initiative in the overall situation. Of course, the main contradictions are not fixed. They can also be transformed under certain circumstances. For example, after the great improvement of mining and tunneling work, there is often insufficient underground transportation and hoisting capacity at the wellhead. At this time, the problem of transportation and hoisting rises to the main contradiction and becomes the main key to the continuous leap forward. Therefore, we must learn to discover and solve the main contradictions. The solution of the current main contradiction will bring about a series of changes in production and realize a new leap forward. On the basis of continuously resolving contradictions, after achieving active balance, we must also prepare forces to break through this balance. Then we will take the initiative to solve the contradiction and organize a new active balance. As long as we recognize the contradiction and master the law of the development of the contradiction, we will be proactive in the face of the contradiction.

    The process of recognizing and mastering the laws of continuous production leaps forward is the process of completely shifting from passive to active. Under the guiding ideology of "self-reliance, always striving for the upstream, rushing forward in everything, and striving for initiative step by step," and on the basis of continuously and correctly resolving contradictions, the Hebi Coal Mine has witnessed the new "routine" of improvement - consolidation - re-improvement in production. This is a reflection of the objective law of imbalance - balance - new imbalance in production, and it is also the result of the subjective initiative of people. The characteristics of this new routine are: the "good start" in the first ten days of each month is the peak of production for the entire month, which breaks through the balance created in the previous month and creates a new imbalance; vigorously engage in high production in the middle ten days to consolidate the new production level reached in the first ten days and achieve a new balance at this new production level; in the last ten days, on the one hand, we must grasp the current production in order to overfulfill the monthly production plan, and on the other hand, we must vigorously grasp production preparation, and prepare good conditions for creating a higher production level for the "good start" in the next month. It is precisely because production develops along the law of improvement - consolidation - re-improvement that a continuous leap forward of one wave a month, one wave higher than the other, has emerged.

    The facts of the continuous leap forward in the production of the Hebi Coal Mine have made us more deeply realize the importance of Chairman Mao's instructions on learning to master the laws of things. Chairman Mao said: "No matter what you do, if you don't understand the situation of that thing, its nature, its relationship with things outside of it, you won't know the law of that thing, you won't know how to do it, and you won't be able to do that thing well." The basic experience of the Hebi Coal Mine has universal significance. For example, the guiding ideology of "self-reliance, always striving for the upstream, rushing forward in everything, and striving for initiative step by step" that the Hebi Coal Mine has gradually established in the practice of struggle; the method of observing and analyzing contradictions from a dialectical materialist point of view; the practice of actively discovering contradictions and taking the initiative to solve contradictions with the spirit of continuous revolution; after the continuous leap forward in production appeared, and the law of continuous leap forward was discovered from it, they took the initiative to adapt to the law, master the law, and make production continue to leap forward along this law, one wave higher than the other. This basic experience is not only applicable to coal mines, but also should be seriously studied in various industries such as iron and steel, and transportation.

### 学会掌握生产持续跃进规律

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    学会掌握生产持续跃进规律
    从开始大跃进到持续大跃进，这是一个发展过程。现在，有些厂矿企业开始找到了并逐步地掌握了生产的持续跃进规律，从而出现了更大更好的全面持续跃进。摆在我们面前的任务，就是要认真地学习先进单位的经验，认真地总结自己的经验，以便从中找出逐步学会掌握生产持续跃进的规律，更好地组织生产的持续大跃进。
    鹤壁煤矿在持续跃进中所以能取得辉煌的成就，这不仅由于他们有一种力争上游的精神，有一种不断革命的精神，还由于他们在组织持续跃进中摸到了生产的持续跃进规律，他们开始学会掌握和运用这一规律为生产服务。
    为什么鹤壁煤矿能够较快地认识和掌握生产的持续跃进规律？我们首先看到的，是政治挂帅、思想领先的决定意义。鹤壁煤矿在党的社会主义建设总路线的指导下，在实践斗争中，逐步形成了“自力更生，永争上游，一切往前赶，步步争主动”的指导思想，这一指导思想成为巨大的物质力量，使他们能够正确地处理大跃进中出现的各种矛盾，从而大大加快了认识和掌握生产的持续跃进规律的过程。不断地正确地解决各种矛盾，是坚持持续跃进的最中心环节。矛盾是事物发展的动力，不敢正视矛盾、希望避开矛盾前进，是不现实的，也是不可能的。在矛盾面前，采取消极平衡态度，也会阻碍生产力的发展。因此，必须学会分析矛盾，掌握矛盾规律，积极去发现矛盾，主动地去解决矛盾。每个事物内部都有好多矛盾，煤矿内部就有采煤、掘进、运输、机电、供应之间的矛盾等。要从当前的复杂的矛盾现象中，找出主要矛盾，因为主要矛盾的存在和发展，规定和影响着其他矛盾的存在和发展。在煤矿中，表现为主要矛盾的，通常是采煤和掘进之间的矛盾。掘进赶不上回采，是在许多煤矿长期存在的现象。由于采煤方法的不断革命，生产的迅速增长，使采煤和掘进的矛盾更加突出出来。这是个关系全局的大问题。鹤壁煤矿解决这个矛盾的办法，是“两手抓”，我们批判了用降低产量来使采煤和掘进进行消极平衡的办法，采取一手抓高产，一手抓掘进，并且紧紧依靠群众，大闹技术革命，大树标兵，大力推广齐合只掘进队快速掘进的经验。这样，就使掘进赶上了采煤的要求。现在，由于大力加强掘进工作的结果，鹤壁煤矿有了六个月以上的获得煤量，他们决定保持这个比例关系，采取了两个掘进头保一个回采头，或三个掘进头保两个回采头的办法。这样，他们就争得了全局的主动。当然，主要矛盾也不是固定不变的，它在一定的情况下，也会转化。比如，在采、掘工作大提高后，就往往出现井下运输和井口的提升力量不足。这时运输和提升的问题，就上升为主要矛盾，成为持续跃进的主要关键。因此必须学会发现和解决主要矛盾。当前的主要矛盾的解决，就会给生产带来一系列的变化，实现新的跃进。我们在不断解决矛盾的基础上，在取得了积极平衡以后，还要准备力量去冲破这个平衡。然后就去主动地解决矛盾，组织新的积极平衡。只要认识了矛盾，掌握了矛盾的发展规律，我们在矛盾面前才会是主动的。
    认识和掌握生产的持续跃进规律的过程，就是由被动完全转向主动的过程。鹤壁煤矿在“自力更生，永争上游，一切往前赶，步步争主动”的指导思想下，在不断地正确解决矛盾的基础上，生产上出现了提高——巩固——再提高的新
  “常规”，这是不平衡——平衡——新的不平衡这一客观规律在生产上的反映，也是人的主观能动作用的结果。这个新常规的特点是：每月上旬的开门红，是全月的生产高峰，它突破了上月所造成的平衡，出现了新的不平衡；中旬大搞高产，是为了巩固上旬所达到的新的生产水平，并在这个新的生产水平上达到新的平衡；到下旬，一方面要抓当前生产，以便超额完成全月的生产计划，一方面大抓生产准备，为下月的开门红创造更高的生产水平准备了良好的条件。正由于生产沿着提高——巩固——再提高这一规律向前发展，就出现了一月一浪、一浪高过一浪的持续大跃进。
    鹤壁煤矿生产持续跃进的事实，使我们更加深刻地体会到毛主席关于学会掌握事物规律的指示的重要性。毛主席说：“不论做什么事，不懂得那件事的情形，它的性质，它和它以外的事情的关联，就不知道那件事的规律，就不知道如何去做，就不能做好那件事。”鹤壁煤矿的基本经验，具有普遍意义。比如，鹤壁煤矿在实践斗争中所逐步树立起来的“自力更生，永争上游，一切往前赶，步步争主动”的指导思想；用辩证唯物主义观点观察和分析矛盾的方法；以不断革命的精神积极去发现矛盾，主动地去解决矛盾的做法；当生产出现了持续跃进，并从中发现了持续跃进规律以后，就主动地去适应规律、掌握规律，使生产沿着这一规律一浪高过一浪地持续跃进的基本经验等，不仅适用于煤矿，在钢铁、交通运输等各个行业也应当认真地加以学习。
