    "Ode to Life"
    After seeing the Pingju opera "Ode to Life," the representatives all said that the young actress Yu Ping played the female salesperson very realistically and enthusiastically, portraying the communist spirit of selfless service to the masses.
    On stage, Zheng Xuehong is a Communist Party member and an advanced salesperson; Yu Ping, in reality, is also a Communist Party member and a representative attending the National Conference of Heroes in Culture and Education. Only with the actor's own "Ode to Life" can there be "Ode to Life" on stage; only when the actor listens to the Party and constantly learns from the masses and from life can the role listen to the actor.
    This is Yu Ping's diary entry about delivering goods to customers' homes with the advanced salesperson Zhang Baozhen: "After walking several streets, the masses treated Zhang Baozhen like a family member, telling her about any major or minor difficulties they had. She was also meticulously considerate to the masses. Today, I not only learned how to push a cart and buy soy sauce, but more importantly, I realized how to be a confidante of the people. I have a strong love for Zhang Baozhen and must use all my body and mind to recreate my love for her on stage."
    ….
    That's how Yu Ping transformed Zhang Baozhen in real life into Zheng Xuehong on the stage.

    “生活的凯歌”
    代表们看过评剧“生活的凯歌”，都说青年演员于萍饰演的女售货员非常真实、热情，演出了忘我为群众服务的共产主义风格。
    舞台上的郑学洪是个共产党员、先进售货员；于萍呢，也是共产党员和出席全国文教群英会的代表。有了演员自己“生活的凯歌”，才能有舞台上“生活的凯歌”；只有演员听党的话，不断向群众、向生活学习，角色才能听演员的话。
    这是于萍同先进售货员张宝珍一起推车送货上门的日记：“走了几条街，群众对张宝珍像亲人一样，谁家有什么大小困难都告诉她，她对群众也体贴得无微不至。今天我不仅学会了推货车、打酱油，更重要的是体会到怎样做人民群众的知心人。我强烈地爱上了张宝珍，一定要用我的全部身心，把对她的热爱再现在舞台上。”
    ……。
    就是这样，于萍把生活中的张宝珍变成了舞台上的郑学洪。
