Shanghai History Community Discusses the Relationship Between Chinese Peasant Wars and Religion

    The "Academic Monthly" published Yang Kuan's "On the 'Taiping Jing'" in its ninth issue last year. The author argued that the "Taiping Jing" was the first theoretical work of peasant revolution in China, which attracted the attention of the historical community. Chen Shoushi published "On Cao Wei's Military Agriculture" in the second issue of the "Academic Monthly" this year and gave a report entitled "The Relationship Between Religion and Peasant Uprisings" at the scientific report meeting held by the History Department of Fudan University, putting forward different views from Yang Kuan. In March and April this year, the Shanghai historical community held two discussions on the issue of peasant wars in Chinese feudal society. During the discussion, the relationship between peasant wars and religion aroused great debate. After the meeting, Yang Kuan published "On the Role of Revolutionary Thought in Chinese Peasant Wars and Its Relationship with Religion" in the seventh issue of the "Academic Monthly" this year, further elaborating on his arguments. A summary of the opinions from all sides since the discussion is presented below.

    I. How Should We Understand That Religion Is "the Opium of the People"?

    Marx and Lenin both said: "Religion is the opium of the people." How should we understand this sentence when studying the relationship between peasant wars and religion? Chen Shoushi believes that religion and peasant wars are diametrically opposed. Religion advocates that people take prayer for the suffering of reality and put their suffering in the "other shore" to solve it. Marx said that religion is the opium of the people, which refers not only to the religion used by the ruling class, but also to the spontaneous religion that is not used by the ruling class. Chen Shoushi also believes that religion is a childhood disease of human thought. He said that Marx also said that if the relationship between people and people, and the relationship between people and nature are clarified, there will be no religious problems. Zhao Renlong basically agreed with Chen Shoushi's opinion. He believes that the occurrence of religion is a manifestation of dissatisfaction with reality, and there are two ways to change reality, namely religion and peasant wars. Religion and peasant wars start from the same point. However, the paths of the two are opposite. He said that religion is an upper structure far from the foundation, which is often behind material life, and it only plays an "opium" role in the process of social development.

    Yang Kuan, Cheng Bohong, Wei Jianyou and others disagreed with the above understanding. Yang Kuan said in his article ("On the Role of Revolutionary Thought in Chinese Peasant Wars and Its Relationship with Religion," hereinafter referred to as the "article") that the "revolutionary socio-political theory" of Chinese peasants is "putting on the cloak of religion" on "the self-interests of these masses," and is a "heresy" in religious sects. He said that the Chinese feudal rulers used theocracy as the theoretical basis for their enslavement of the people, and if the peasants wanted to rise up in revolution, they must first seize the theocracy from the hands of the landlords. The only way to do this is to say that the gods they believe in are the protectors of the interests of the peasants, to say that their revolutionary ideas are the will of God, to say that their belief in revolutionary victory is determined by God, and to say that their actions are "acting on behalf of heaven." He said that the religion used by peasant wars is fundamentally different from the religion that was used to anesthetize and enslave the people at that time.

    Cheng Bohong believes that religion can be something else besides the role of opium in a certain period. In studying history, we should not only see the commonality of religion, but also ignore its different roles in different periods. Wei Jianyou also said that Marx's assertion that religion is "the opium of the people" is for general religions, and the God Worshipping Society should not be regarded as "the opium of the people" because it is a revolutionary organization that has been playing an active role in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution.

    II. What Is the Relationship Between Peasant Revolutionary Thought and Religious Dogma?

    Because there are different understandings of "religion is the opium of the people," there are also two different opinions on the relationship between peasant revolutionary thought and religious dogma. Chen Shoushi and Zhao Renlong believe that peasant revolutionary thought should be found in class struggle and has nothing to do with religious dogma.

    Chen Shoushi said that peasant wars have nothing to do with religious dogma. For example, although Zhu Yuanzhang was born in the peasant uprising at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, which was launched by Manichaeism and the Ming Cult, the Zhu Ming Dynasty he established can be said to have nothing to do with the tenets of Manichaeism in terms of political facilities. Religion is the superstructure. When dealing with historical issues, we should start from the social foundation, not from religion. He also believes that no political program for peasant uprisings can be found in religious dogma, such as the uprisings of the Mahayana Sect, Maitreya Sect, and White Lotus Sect. If it is believed that peasant uprisings use dogma as a political program, then the role and value of peasant uprisings in history are actually reduced. The relationship between dogma and peasant revolutionary thought is only an appearance. Zhao Renlong believes that the essence of reflecting class struggle is class relations, which has nothing to do with religious dogma. It is class struggle that dominates dogma, not dogma that dominates class struggle. Otherwise, religion becomes something beyond class.

    In contrast, Yang Kuan, Cheng Bohong, Wei Jianyou and others believe that some religious doctrines reflect the demands of the peasant revolution, provide the cloak of the peasant revolutionary ideological system, and are peasant revolutionary thoughts cloaked in religion.

    Yang Kuan said in his article that in feudal society, peasants were cruelly exploited and oppressed and had anti-feudal revolutionary ideas, and the main content of this idea was egalitarianism. Yang Kuan believes that Chinese peasant wars developed from the connection between peasant revolutionary thought and religion. The main "doctrines" they promote are essentially peasant revolutionary thoughts cloaked in religion. Their political struggle slogans, their simple socio-political ideas such as "equality" and "egalitarianism," are often developed through religious language. He also believes that the religions used in Chinese peasant wars in the past dynasties, such as "Taiping Tao," "Tianshi Tao," and "Ming Cult," although different sects, have a common feature, that is, they mainly promote "doctrines" with revolutionary thought as the main content, provide revolutionary slogans with religious cloaks, carry out activities to mobilize and organize peasant revolutions, and promote some revolutionary measures that meet the requirements of poor peasants. He also pointed out that Chinese peasant wars put on the cloak of religion in revolutionary theory and adopted the organizational form of religion, first of all because they combined the struggle to overthrow the feudal regime with the struggle to overthrow the feudal theocracy.

    Cheng Bohong said that heresy of theology appeared in the Middle Ages. The ruled class created its own doctrines and put forward its own demands. They talked about "acting on behalf of heaven," but they were actually doing human affairs. Religion is linked to political thought, providing the cloak of the ideological system. As an ideology, religious dogma must play an organizational, propaganda, and mobilizing role in the revolutionary struggle of peasants. Wei Jianyou also said that the three larger-scale peasant wars in modern times were all combined with religion, with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom being the most typical. It was led by the God Worshipping Society, a revolutionary religious organization. The various systems and policies of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were based on the doctrines of the God Worshipping Society. The God Worshipping Society was linked to politics and military affairs. He said that wherever the Taiping Army arrived, they would "reason" and carry out revolutionary propaganda based on the doctrines.

    III. What Role Does Religion Play in Peasant Wars?

    Chen Shoushi and Zhao Renlong believe that religion plays an organizational role in peasant wars at the beginning, but it plays a hindering and destructive role after the peasant uprising breaks out.

    Chen Shoushi said that religion did play some organizational role in peasant wars, but after religion gathered the peasants, its role dissolved. He disagreed with the view that Zhang Lu's establishment of a regime was due to the role of religion, and believed that it was not sustainable to carry out peasant wars with religion. Zhao Renlong also said that once a peasant uprising breaks out, religion plays a negative role. He opposed the view that religious dogma is a political slogan, believing that dogma cannot be used as a political slogan because it will make the direction of revolutionary struggle unclear. Therefore, after the outbreak of peasant wars, religion was abandoned, as was the case with Zhu Yuanzhang and the Yellow Turbans. He also said that the more peasant wars are bound by religious dogma, the weaker the struggle; the smaller the bondage, the stronger the struggle.

    However, Yang Kuan, Cheng Bohong, Wei Jianyou and others believe that religion not only played an organizational role at the beginning of peasant wars, but also played an active role in organization, propaganda, and mobilization, and this role ran through the entire peasant war.

    Yang Kuan believes in his article that using religion is an organizational form of peasant revolution. Peasants connect revolutionary ideas with certain doctrines in religion and develop them as a means to mobilize and organize revolution. Struggle slogans and prophecies cloaked in religion inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the peasants and strengthened the revolutionary confidence and courage of the broad masses of peasants. This revolutionary thought cloaked in religion also plays a certain guiding role in revolutionary practice, and often determines their revolutionary organizational form and affects their revolutionary measures. He also pointed out that Chinese peasant wars have repeatedly used the organizational form of religion, which is an outstanding creation. Because, under the historical conditions at that time, religion was the only organizational form familiar to peasants, and only through the connection of religious organizations could isolated villages and scattered peasants be linked together.

    Cheng Bohong believes that once the peasant movement is combined with religion, the dogma must adapt to this change, and the changed dogma in turn affects the masses, plays a role in promoting the revolutionary struggle, and these roles are from beginning to end. Wei Jianyou discussed the role of religion in the peasant revolutionary struggle in his article "The Relationship Between the God Worshipping Society and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolutionary Movement." He said that the establishment of the God Worshipping Society was to cover up the peasant revolution, and there were many revolutionary theories in its doctrines. Therefore, it played a positive role in promoting the peasant uprising, not only before the uprising, but also after the uprising, it continued to play a mobilizing and organizing role, at least in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era.

### 上海历史学界讨论关于中国农民战争与宗教的关系问题

    上海历史学界讨论关于中国农民战争与宗教的关系问题
    《学术月刊》去年第九期发表了杨宽的《论《太平经》》一文，作者认为《太平经》是我国第一部农民革命的理论著作，这个意见引起了史学界的注意。陈守实在《学术月刊》今年第二期发表了《论曹魏屯田》一文，并在复旦大学历史系举行的科学报告会上作了题为《宗教与农民起义关系》的报告，提出了与杨宽不同的见解。今年3、4月，上海史学界就中国封建社会的农民战争问题进行了两次讨论。在讨论中，农民战争与宗教的关系问题引起很大的争论。会后，杨宽在《学术月刊》今年第七期上又发表了《论中国农民战争中革命思想的作用及其与宗教的关系》一文，进一步阐述了他的论点。现将讨论以来各方面的意见作一综述。
    一、如何理解宗教是“人民的鸦片烟”？
    马克思、列宁都说过：“宗教是人民的鸦片烟”。在研究农民战争与宗教关系时应该怎样理解这句话呢？陈守实认为，宗教与农民战争是背道而驰的。宗教主张人们对于现实的痛苦采取祈祷，将自己的痛苦放到“彼岸”去解决。马克思说宗教是人民的鸦片烟，这不仅是指被统治阶级利用的宗教，而且是指自发的和不被统治阶级利用的宗教。陈守实还认为，宗教是人类思想上的幼稚病。他说，马克思还说过，如果人与人之间的关系、人与自然的关系弄清楚了，那就不会有宗教的问题了。赵人龙基本上同意陈守实的意见。他认为，宗教的发生是对现实不满的表现，而改变现实有两种方法，就是宗教和农民战争。宗教和农民战争出发点是一个。然而两者的道路却是相反的。他说，宗教是远离基础的上层建筑，往往落后于物质生活，它在社会发展过程中只扮演了一个“鸦片烟”的角色。
    杨宽、程博洪、魏建猷等不同意上面这种理解。杨宽在他的文章（《论中国农民战争中革命思想的作用及其与宗教的关系》，下同）中说，中国农民“革命的社会政治理论”，是在“这些群众的自身利益上穿上宗教的外衣”，是宗教教派中的“异端”。他说，中国封建统治者以神权作为他们奴役人民的理论根据，而农民要起来革命，就必须首先要把神权从地主手中夺过来。其唯一的办法就是把自己信奉的神说成是农民利益的保护者，把自己的革命思想说成是神的意志，把自己的革命胜利的信念说成是神所决定的，把自己的行动说成是“替天行道”。他说，农民战争所利用的这种宗教是与当时作为麻醉和奴役人民的宗教根本不同的。
    程博洪认为，宗教在一个时期内除了鸦片烟的作用以外，还可以是些别的东西。在研究历史时，不应该只看到宗教的共性，而忽视了它在不同时期的不同作用。魏建猷也说，马克思关于宗教是“人民的鸦片烟”的论断，是就一般宗教来说的，而拜上帝会就不能认为是“人民的鸦片烟”，因为它是具有革命性的组织，在太平天国革命中一直起着积极作用。
    二、农民革命思想与宗教教义的关系怎样？
    因为对于“宗教是人民的鸦片烟”有不同的理解，所以在农民革命思想与宗教教义的关系上也有两种不同的意见。陈守实、赵人龙认为，农民革命思想应从阶级斗争中去找，与宗教教义无关。
    陈守实说，农民战争与宗教教义是无关的，如朱元璋虽然出身于以摩尼教、明教所发动的元末农民大起义，但是他所建立的朱明王朝，在政治设施上与摩尼教的教义可以说一无关系。宗教是上层建筑，在处理历史问题时，应从社会基础开始，而不应从宗教开始。他并且认为，从宗教教义中找不出农民起义的政治纲领，例如大乘教、弥勒教、白莲教起义等。如果认为农民起义是以教义作为政治纲领的，那在实际上就降低了农民起义在历史上的作用和价值。教义与农民革命思想发生关系只是一层外表。赵人龙认为，反映阶级斗争实质是阶级关系，与宗教教义是没有什么联系的。是阶级斗争支配教义，而不是教义支配阶级斗争。否则，宗教就成了超阶级的东西了。
    与此相反，杨宽、程博洪、魏建猷等认为，某些宗教教义反映了农民革命要求，提供了农民革命思想体系的外衣，是披上宗教外衣的农民革命思想。
    杨宽在他的文章中说，在封建社会中，农民受到残酷的剥削和压迫，具有反封建的革命思想，而这种思想的主要内容就是平均主义。杨宽认为，中国农民战争是农民革命思想与宗教相联结而发展起来的。他们宣传的主要“教义”，实质上是披上宗教外衣的农民革命思想。他们的政治斗争口号，他们的“平等”、“平均”等朴素的社会政治思想，也往往凭借宗教的语言来加以发挥。他并认为，中国历代农民战争所利用的宗教，如“太平道”、“天师道”、“明教”等，虽然教派不同，但是它们有一个共同的特点，就是主要宣传的是以革命思想为主要内容的“教义”，提供了带有宗教外衣的革命口号，进行着动员和组织农民革命的活动，推行着符合于贫苦农民要求的若干革命措施。他还指出，中国农民战争在革命理论上披上了宗教的外衣，采取宗教的组织形式，首先就是由于他们把推翻封建政权与推翻封建神权的斗争结合起来的缘故。
    程博洪说，中世纪出现了神学的“异端”，被统治阶级创造了自己的教义，提出了自己的要求，他们讲“替天行道”，实际上是行人道。宗教与政治思想联结在一起，提供了思想体系的外衣。而宗教教义作为一种意识形态，它对农民的革命斗争必然起着组织与宣传鼓动作用。魏建猷也说，近代三次规模较大的农民战争都是与宗教结合在一起的，太平天国最为典型，它是由拜上帝会这一具有革命性的宗教组织领导的。太平天国的各项制度和政策就是依据拜上帝会教义的，拜上帝教与政治、军事三者联结为一体。他说，太平军到达任何地方，就都是根据教义来“讲道理”，进行革命宣传的。
    三、宗教对农民战争起什么作用？
    陈守实、赵人龙认为，宗教对于农民战争在开始时起组织的作用，但是在农民起义爆发后就起阻碍和破坏的作用了。
    陈守实说，宗教对于农民战争是起了些组织作用的，但是宗教把农民聚集起来后，它的作用就消解了。他不同意张鲁的建立政权是宗教起作用的说法，认为以宗教进行农民战争是不能持久的。赵人龙也说，农民起义一旦爆发，宗教就起消极作用了。他反对宗教教义是政治口号的说法，认为教义是不能作为政治口号的，因为它会使革命斗争方向不明。因此，农民战争爆发后，宗教就被抛开，朱元璋、黄巾等都是如此。他并且说，农民战争受宗教教义束缚愈大，斗争性就愈弱；束缚愈小，斗争性就愈强。
    但是，杨宽、程博洪、魏建猷等认为，宗教对农民战争不仅在开始时起了组织作用，而且在组织宣传鼓动方面都起了积极的作用，并且这种作用是贯串农民战争的始终的。
    杨宽在他的文章中认为，利用宗教是农民革命的一种组织形式。农民把革命思想与宗教中的某些教义相联结而加以发挥，作为他们鼓动和组织革命的手段。披着宗教外衣的斗争口号和预言，鼓舞了农民革命的热情，加强了广大农民革命的信心和勇气。这种披着宗教外衣的革命思想，对革命的实践也起着一定的指导作用，还往往决定着他们革命的组织形式，影响着他们的革命措施。他还指出，中国历代农民战争多次利用宗教的组织形式，这是一种杰出的创造。因为，在当时的历史条件下，宗教是农民唯一熟悉的组织形式，只有通过宗教组织的联系，才可以使各个孤立的农村和分散的农民联结起来。
    程博洪认为，农民运动一与宗教相结合，教义就必须适应这个变化，而已经变化了的教义反转过来影响群众，对革命斗争起了推进的作用，并且这些作用是从头至尾的。魏建猷在《拜上帝会与太平天国革命运动的关系》一文中，论述了宗教在农民革命斗争中的作用。他说，拜上帝会的成立是为了掩护农民革命，它的教义中也存在着许多革命理论。因此，它对农民起义起了积极的推动作用，这不仅在起义前，而且在起义后仍然起着动员组织作用，至少在太平天国时代是如此。
