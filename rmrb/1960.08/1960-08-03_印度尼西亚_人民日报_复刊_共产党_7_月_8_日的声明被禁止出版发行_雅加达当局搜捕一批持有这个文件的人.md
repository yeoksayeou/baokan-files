Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 2nd: The "People's Daily," an Indonesian Communist Party newspaper that was ordered to cease publication on July 16th by the Jakarta wartime authorities, resumed publication today. The newspaper was previously ordered to cease publication because it published a statement by the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party evaluating the work of the Indonesian Working Cabinet over the past year. This statement was deemed to have "disrupted public order and security."

Lieutenant Edi, a spokesman for the Jakarta wartime authority, announced the permission for the "People's Daily" to resume publication on August 1st, saying that if the newspaper publishes articles and news that "may disrupt order and public security" again in the future, the Jakarta wartime authority will take more severe measures against the newspaper than those already taken.

The "People's Daily" said today that during the short period of more than ten days in which it was forced to suspend publication, it received relief funds from many readers and sympathizers across the country, expressing their sympathy and support for the newspaper.

According to a report by the Indonesian News Agency on August 1st, after the booklets containing the statement of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party on the Working Cabinet were banned in Jakarta and West Java, the wartime authority in South Kalimantan also ordered a ban on the distribution, transmission, publication, and mailing of this booklet in the region. The order stated that the authorities would take strict measures against those who violate this order.

The news agency also reported that Lieutenant Edi announced on July 30th that after "observing subversives," searches had been carried out in the past few days. Edi said that officers had arrested a group of people on charges of violating the Jakarta wartime authority's order prohibiting the publication, reprinting, and display of this booklet published by the Indonesian Communist Party Politburo. He said that those arrested who possessed the aforementioned Indonesian Communist Party booklet are now under interrogation and will soon be submitted to the court. Edi said: These searches were conducted under a state of "national alert." He did not announce the number of people arrested. Edi said that the Minister of Security also rounded up twelve people accused of holding gatherings without permission, and the leaders of this gathering were also arrested and will soon be submitted to court for trial.

According to Antara News Agency's report from Bandung on July 29th, Lieutenant Colonel Nawawi Arif, the press officer of the Sixth Military Region of West Java, said that the booklet containing the July 8th statement of the Indonesian Communist Party is prohibited from being published, transmitted, stored, distributed, bought, sold, mailed, or reprinted in West Java. Nawawi said that those who possess such booklets must hand them over to the relevant authorities.

    共产党7月8日的声明被禁止出版发行  雅加达当局搜捕一批持有这个文件的人
    新华社雅加达2日电　在7月16日被雅加达战时掌权者勒令停刊的印度尼西亚共产党报纸“人民日报”今天复刊。这家报纸这次被勒令停刊是因为它刊登了印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局评价印度尼西亚工作内阁一年来工作的声明。这项声明被认为“扰乱了公共秩序和治安。”
    雅加达战时掌权部发言人埃迪中尉1日宣布准许“人民日报”复刊时说，如果这家报纸将来再次发表“可能扰乱秩序和公共治安”的文章和消息，雅加达战时掌权部将对这家报纸采取比迄今已经采取过的措施更加严厉的措施。
    “人民日报”今天说，这家报纸在被迫停刊的短短十多天中，收到全国各地许多读者和同情者的救济金，表示他们对这家报纸的同情和支持。
    另据印度尼西亚新闻社1日报道，在雅加达和西爪哇禁止印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局关于工作内阁的声明的小册子之后，南加里曼丹战时掌权者也已下令禁止在这个地区发行、传送、出版和邮寄这个小册子。命令说，当局将对违反这项命令的人采取严厉的措施。
    这家通讯社还报道，埃迪中尉7月30日宣布，在“对颠覆分子进行观察”以后，过去几天里进行了搜捕。埃迪说，军官们逮捕了一批人，罪名是违反了雅加达战时掌权者禁止出版、翻印和展示印度尼西亚共产党政治局发表的这个小册子的命令。他说，持有上述印度尼西亚共产党的小册子的那些被捕的人现在正在讯问中，不久即将提交法院。埃迪说：这些搜捕是在实行“全国警戒”状态的情况下进行的。他没有宣布被逮捕的人数。埃迪说，保安部长还兜捕了十二名被控未经许可而举行集会的人，这次集会的领导人也被捕了，不久即将提交法院审讯。
    据安塔拉通讯社29日自万隆报道，西爪哇第六军区新闻官纳瓦维·阿利夫中校说，载有印度尼西亚共产党7月8日声明的小册子被禁止在西爪哇出版、传送、收藏、分发、买卖、邮寄或翻印。纳瓦维说，持有这种小册子的人必须把它们交给有关当局。
