Xinhua News Agency report:
The Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a notice on strengthening cotton field management and vigorously grasping the first and autumn bolls, requiring all cotton-producing areas to seize the current key season for cotton growth, further strengthen cotton field management, increase bud formation and boll protection, and do everything possible to increase cotton yield per unit area to ensure the completion of this year's cotton production targets.

The notice said: In many cotton fields in the Yellow River Basin cotton-growing areas, due to the late development due to drought in the spring, not many early bolls have formed, and some cotton fields have basically not formed any early bolls. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen field management to promote cotton to form more first and autumn bolls, so as to ensure increased production. Cotton fields with better growth and more early bolls should be encouraged to form more first and autumn bolls, and strive for overproduction; cotton fields with poor growth and few early bolls should be managed more closely to form more first and autumn bolls to make up for the deficiency of the early bolls. According to the experience of the past two years, in the main cotton-producing areas of the Yellow River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin, the flowers that bloom in early September can still form effective cotton bolls. It is entirely possible to form more first and autumn bolls, achieving the goal of "first bolls filling the waist and autumn bolls covering the top" within the available timeframe. The core of forming more first and autumn bolls is to prevent premature aging of cotton plants. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively arrange labor, continuously conduct cotton field surveys, and carry out a field management campaign centered on irrigation, drainage, topdressing, pest control, pruning, cultivating, loosening the soil, and eliminating weeds, to fully exploit the potential of cotton to form more first and autumn bolls. In terms of fertilizer, the method proposed by Handan City, Hebei Province, of using "earth manure, human waste and urine, chemical fertilizer, cake fertilizer, and soil fertilizer" in combination to increase the amount of fertilizer applied to cotton fields and prevent premature aging of cotton plants is very good. In short, all powerful measures must be taken to strengthen cotton field management, and harvesting should not stop until management stops, to ensure increased production in every cotton field.

The Ministry of Agriculture requires all cotton-growing areas to continue to strengthen the fight against disasters and ensure that the existing cotton fields are not reduced. Management must not be relaxed for cotton fields with poor growth and many missing seedlings, and efforts must be made to increase production. For cotton fields with serious missing seedlings, only intercropping with other crops is permitted, and destroying seedlings and abandoning them is not allowed. At present, in some cotton-growing areas in the south, mirid bugs, mole crickets, leafhoppers, spider mites, and beet armyworms are causing serious damage; in the northern cotton-growing areas, the third generation of cotton bollworms is laying eggs and causing damage. The damage is occurring earlier and more severely in densely growing cotton fields. Bridge worms, mirid bugs, mole crickets, boll weevils, etc., are also occurring. It is necessary to seize the opportunity to eliminate these pests during the bud and boll stage. In particular, the red bollworm in the southern cotton-growing areas and Shaanxi cotton-growing area, and the cotton bollworm in the northern cotton-growing area are causing serious damage, and drugs should be mixed to treat other diseases and insect pests at the same time to completely eliminate the damage. This year, there is a large area of high-yielding cotton, and water and fertilizer are sufficient, so it is also necessary to strictly prevent the occurrence of the next generation of cotton insects and cotton diseases.

The notice stated that the state's supply of pesticides to cotton-growing areas this year has increased significantly compared to last year, and most of the cotton field chemical fertilizers have been allocated to various provinces. All cotton-growing areas should give full play to the yield-increasing effect of existing chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The suitable period for cotton topdressing is still about 20 days, which is also a critical period for preventing and controlling bud and boll pests. The agricultural departments of all provinces must seize the time to organize an inspection, and cooperate with relevant units such as commerce and transportation to properly and promptly solve problems such as allocation, packaging, and transportation. In particular, it is necessary to organize short-distance transportation to deliver chemical fertilizers and pesticides to the production grassroots in a timely manner, without delaying the agricultural season, and use them in cotton fields.

    抓季节　加措施　增蕾保桃
    农业部要求各地加强棉田管理
    据新华社讯　农业部最近发出关于加强棉田管理，大抓伏桃和秋桃的通知，要求各棉区抓紧当前棉花生长的关键季节，进一步加强棉田管理工作，增蕾保桃，千方百计提高棉花单位面积产量，保证完成今年棉花产量指标。
    通知说：黄河流域棉区很多棉田，由于春季受旱发育晚，结的伏前桃不多，部分棉田基本没结伏前桃。因此，必须加强田间管理，促使棉花多结伏桃和秋桃，以确保增产。生长较好结伏前桃多的棉田，要促使多结伏桃和秋桃，力争超产；生长较差结伏前桃少的棉田，更应抓紧管理，多结伏桃和秋桃，以补足伏前桃的不足。根据这两年的经验，黄河流域和长江流域的主要棉区，在9月上旬开的花仍然可结成有效棉桃，多结伏桃和秋桃，达到伏桃满腰秋桃盖顶的要求，在时间上还大有可为。多结伏桃和秋桃的中心是防止棉株早衰，因此必须全面安排劳力，不断进行棉田排队，开展以灌溉、排水、追肥、治虫、整枝、中耕、松土、消灭杂草为中心的田间管理运动，充分发挥棉花多结伏桃和秋桃的潜力。在肥料上，河北省邯郸市提出的“土粪、人粪尿、化肥、饼肥、土化肥”五肥并用，以增加棉田的施肥量，防止棉株早衰的办法很好。总之，要采取一切强有力的措施，加强棉田管理，收获不完管理不停，以保证块块棉田增产。
    农业部要求各棉区继续加强抗灾斗争，保证现有棉田不再减少。对目前生长差和缺苗较多的棉田，绝对不能放松管理，要力争增产。对缺苗严重的棉田，只许补种其它作物，不许毁苗废弃。目前，南方部分棉区的盲椿象、金钢钻、叶跳虫、红蜘蛛、斜纹夜蛾为害较重；北方棉区第三代棉铃虫正在产卵为害，生长密茂的棉田发生较早较重，造桥虫、盲椿象、金钢钻、象鼻虫等也有发生。必须抓紧时机，消灭这些蕾铃期的害虫。特别是南方棉区和陕西棉区的红铃虫，北方棉区的棉铃虫为害严重，应该采取药剂混用，兼治其他病虫的办法，彻底消灭为害。今年棉花丰产方面积大、水肥足，还须严防下一代棉虫和棉病的发生。
    通知说，今年国家供应棉区的农药比去年增加很多，棉田化肥绝大部分已调拨到各省，各棉区要充分发挥现有化肥、农药的增产效用。当前棉花追肥适期还有二十天左右，又正是防治蕾铃虫害的关键时期。各省农业部门必须抓紧时间组织一次检查，协同商业、交通运输等有关单位，妥善及时地解决调拨、包装、运输等问题，特别是要组织好短途运输，将化肥、农药及时供应到生产基层去，不误农时，使用于棉田。
