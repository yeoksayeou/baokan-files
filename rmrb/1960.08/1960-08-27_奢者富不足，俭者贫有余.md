    "Extravagance leaves even the rich wanting, frugality leaves even the poor with surplus"
    Jilin Siping, Zhu Huixian
    To put it simply, "Extravagance leaves even the rich wanting, frugality leaves even the poor with surplus" means that even the rich, if extravagant, will find themselves unable to make ends meet. Conversely, even the poor, if diligent and frugal, will have something to spare.
    There's a family across from us with a monthly income of sixty-three yuan, seven people in total, five children. That averages out to less than ten yuan per person, yet they manage their household affairs very well and even have savings in the bank! But then there's another family with a monthly income of one hundred and four yuan, five people, three children. That averages out to around twenty yuan per person, but they have no budgeting at all. They spend whatever they earn, preferring the new to the old, without any thought of making do. As a result, they've saved nothing and even have to borrow money from others towards the end of each month.
    To live well, one must have a plan. One cannot simply indulge in extravagance for the sake of momentary convenience. Does one not have to think about tomorrow? If we want to live well tomorrow, the day after, and far into the future, we must start with diligence and thrift and cultivate a habit of hard work and frugality in our daily lives.
    National construction, like managing a household, also requires diligence and frugality. The Party has long advocated building the country with diligence and frugality and running all undertakings with diligence and frugality.
    Our motherland is a large family, and everyone is a member of this family. The fate of the nation is tied to the fate of each individual. If we want to build our country into a prosperous and strong nation, all units, enterprises, and departments should adhere to the spirit of diligence and frugality in all their undertakings.
    Our country was originally "poor and blank." All funds should be used where they are most needed to facilitate rapid development. Waste and extravagance are harmful and unproductive. Even when we are rich, we should not forget frugality. In a large country of 650 million people, if everyone, every enterprise, and every unit pays attention to thrift, it will add a tremendous wealth to the country.
    Extravagance and waste are the lifestyle of all exploiting classes. They gain without labor and do not understand the hard-won nature of material wealth. We, the working people, deeply understand the hardships involved in creating material wealth through our own labor. Therefore, we working people have always had a lifestyle of hard work, simplicity, diligence, and thrift. This is the virtue of our working people.
    Let the spirit of hard work, simplicity, diligence, and thrift be further promoted!

### “奢者富不足，俭者贫有余”

    “奢者富不足，俭者贫有余”
    吉林四平　朱惠仙
    “奢者富不足，俭者贫有余”这句话通俗一点讲，就是富者虽富，但奢侈，也会入不敷出；贫者虽贫，但勤俭，也会有余。
    我们对面有一家，每月工资六十三元，七口人，五个孩子，每人平均不到十元钱，可是他们家的生活安排得很好，银行里还有储蓄哩！可是另一家呢，每月工资一百零四元，五口人，三个孩子，每人平均二十来元，可是开支一点计划也没有，挣多少，花多少，有新不用旧，一点也没有“将就”思想，结果，什么也没积下，甚至到每月下旬还得向人家借钱。
    过日子，必须有计划才行。不能只图一时方便，就信手胡花，难道明天不过了吗？要想明天、后天、更长远地过下去，要把日子过得好，必须从勤俭开始，在日常生活里，养成克勤克俭的风气。
    国家建设和过日子一样，也要勤俭。党在很早就提出要勤俭建国，勤俭办一切事业。
    我们的祖国是一个大家庭，每个人都是这个家庭中的一员，国家的命运关系着每个人的命运，要想把祖国建设成繁荣富强的国家，无论是各单位各企业各部门，办一切事业都应本着勤俭的精神。
    我们国家原是“一穷二白”的，一切资金都应该用在“节骨眼”上，才能有利于建设的迅速发展；挥霍浪费是有害无益的。即使我们已经很富了，也应该不忘节俭。六亿五千万人的大国，每个人，每个企业，每个单位，如果都注意了节俭，就会给国家增加一笔巨大的财富。
    奢侈浪费是一切剥削阶级的生活作风，他们不劳而获，不知物质财富的来之不易。我们劳动人民，在亲身的劳动中，深知在创造物质财富过程中的艰辛。因此，我们劳动人民从来就有着艰苦朴素、勤俭节约的生活作风。这是我们劳动人民的美德。
    让艰苦朴素、勤俭节约的精神更加发扬光大！
