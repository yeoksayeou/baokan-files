    Northwest Four Provinces/Regions Carefully Harvest and Thresh Wheat
    Xinjiang Has Harvested 10 Million Mu of Wheat from South to North, Gansu's Spring Wheat Production Areas Emphasize Careful Harvesting and Threshing
    Ningxia Basically Completes Harvesting of Over 2 Million Mu of Spring Wheat, Qinghai Organizes Cooperation to Ensure Harvesting as It Ripens
    Urumqi dispatch from Xinhua News Agency: Currently, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has harvested over 10 million mu of wheat, generally achieving harvesting and bundling as it turns yellow, and transporting, threshing, and cleaning into storage simultaneously.
    This year, Xinjiang's wheat acreage has expanded by over 4 million mu compared to last year. Due to good planting and careful management, and after successively overcoming natural disasters such as wind, frost, drought, and pests, both winter and spring wheat are growing very well. During the wheat harvest, because various localities concentrated 80% of their labor force on rushing the harvest, the pace of the harvest has generally accelerated. By the end of July, the wheat harvest in southern Xinjiang, except for a few high-altitude mountainous areas, was completely finished. The wheat fields in the Turpan Basin and the southern edge of the Junggar Basin in northern Xinjiang have also been successively harvested. Currently, large-scale wheat harvesting is shifting to the Ili River Valley Basin, Qitai and Mulei north of the Bogda Mountains, and the Tacheng area. In the Altai Mountains, where wheat matures the latest, winter and spring wheat have also begun to turn yellow and are being harvested.
    Xinjiang has more land and less labor. In previous wheat harvests, the phenomenon of discarding and wasting was relatively serious. This year, various localities have universally organized re-harvesting and re-threshing acceptance teams. Each plot is accepted after harvesting, and each field is accepted after threshing, so that the wheat fields and threshing grounds that have been re-harvested and re-threshed are free of lost ears and unthreshed grains.
    Lanzhou dispatch from Xinhua News Agency: Various localities in Gansu Province are tensely rushing to harvest spring wheat. By the beginning of August, the Dingxi and Zhangye Special Zones and the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, the main spring wheat producing areas, had harvested more than 3 million mu of spring wheat. In Dingxi Special Zone, winter wheat has been completely harvested, and the harvest has shifted to spring wheat, with a daily harvesting progress of more than 134,000 mu. In Zhangye Special Zone, where the harvesting time varies greatly, the spring wheat harvest has basically ended in 102 communes in six counties and cities, including Dunhuang, Wuwei, Zhangye, and Jiuquan, and more than half of the state-owned farms. Other areas are entering a busy stage, and a small number of areas are preparing for harvesting.
    This year, the harvesting quality in most areas is good, harvesting, transporting, and threshing are timely, and careful harvesting and threshing are achieved.
    Yinchuan dispatch from Xinhua News Agency: The spring wheat in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has basically been harvested. The one million mu of spring wheat on both sides of the Yellow River in the autonomous region was completely harvested as early as mid-July, and the more than one million mu of spring wheat in the eastern and southern mountainous areas has also been basically harvested. Under the slogan of "Careful harvesting, careful threshing, clean fields, and all grains returning to the granary," people of all ethnic groups are carrying out rushing to transport and rushing to thresh, etc.
    This year, spring wheat in the Ningxia area is generally growing well. The spring wheat in the counties and cities east of the Yellow River and in most areas of the eastern and southern mountainous areas is growing better than last year. Although the spring wheat in the counties and cities west of the Yellow River was affected to a certain extent by the decline in the water level of the Yellow River during the growing season, which prevented timely irrigation, due to continuous efforts to strengthen field management, the overall growth is still good, except for some areas where the spring wheat is relatively poor.
    During the summer harvest, various agencies, schools, organizations, troops, industrial and mining enterprises sent large numbers of personnel to support the summer harvest, forming a new upsurge of all sectors of society fully supporting agriculture.
    Xining dispatch from Xinhua News Agency: In Qinghai Province, spring wheat and highland barley are turning yellow successively from the plains to the mountains, and from the southeast to the northwest. While managing late-maturing fields well, people of all ethnic groups are carrying out rushing to harvest and re-planting.
    Last winter and this spring, Qinghai Province reclaimed a large amount of wasteland, increasing the planting area of spring wheat and highland barley by more than two-thirds. In the struggle to rush the harvest of spring wheat and highland barley, because the maturity period of spring wheat and highland barley in the river valleys and mountains varies, various people's communes universally organized large-scale cooperation between the mountains and river valleys based on the principle of equivalent exchange. The wheat fields of two production brigades in the Hongshui Commune in Ledu County, located in river valley areas, have turned yellow. Two mountain brigades whose maturity period is still one month away dispatched labor to form four support expedition teams, carrying tools, and went down the mountain to the river valley areas to support the rush harvest, so that early-maturing areas could harvest as they turned yellow.
    The people of all ethnic groups in the later-maturing northwest and newly reclaimed areas are strengthening late-stage field management to strive for high yields, and are actively preparing for harvesting. (With pictures)

    西北四省、区精收细打小麦
    新疆由南而北已收割小麦一千万亩　甘肃春麦产区重视细收细打
    宁夏二百多万亩春麦基本收割完毕　青海组织协作保证随熟随收
    据新华社乌鲁木齐讯　目前，新疆维吾尔自治区的小麦收割面积已超过一千多万亩，一般都做到随黄随收、随收随捆，边拉、边打，扬净入仓。
    今年新疆小麦面积比去年扩大了四百多万亩。由于种得好、管得细，并相继战胜了风霜干旱和病虫等自然灾害，冬春小麦都生长得很好。在麦收中由于各地集中了80％的劳动力进行抢收，麦收进度普遍加快。到7月底，新疆南部除少数高寒山区外，麦收已全部结束。北疆吐鲁番盆地和准噶尔盆地南缘的麦田也相继割完。目前大规模的麦收工作正转向伊犁河谷盆地、博格多山以北的奇台、木垒等地和塔城专区，小麦成熟最晚的阿尔泰山区，冬春小麦也开始黄熟，开镰收割。
    新疆地多劳动力少，往年麦收中抛撒浪费现象比较严重，今年各地普遍组织了复收复打验收小组，收一块验收一块，打一场，验收一场，使复收复打过的麦田和麦场，做到不丢穗、不夹粒。
    据新华社兰州讯　甘肃省各地正在紧张抢收春麦。春麦主要产区的定西、张掖两专区和临夏回族自治州到8月初已收春麦三百多万亩，定西专区，冬麦已经全部收完，转入收割春麦，收割日进度达到十三万四千多亩。收割时间差别较大的张掖专区，敦煌、武威、张掖、酒泉等六个县、市的一百零二个公社和半数以上的国营农场，春麦收割已经基本结束，其它地区正进入大忙阶段，尚有少数地区正在准备收割。
    今年大部分地区收割质量好，收、运、打及时，并做到细收细打。
    据新华社银川讯　宁夏回族自治区春小麦已基本收割完毕。自治区黄河两岸一百万亩春小麦，早在7月中旬即全部收割完，东、南部山区一百多万亩春小麦也已基本收完。各族人民在“细收细打地净场光，复收复打颗粒归仓”的口号下，正进行抢运、抢打等工作。
    宁夏地区今年春小麦一般生长良好，黄河东岸各县市和东、南部山区大部分地区春麦生长情况超过去年。黄河西岸各县市的春麦，虽然在生长季节黄河水位下降不能及时灌溉，生长受到一定影响，但是由于人们不断努力加强田间管理，除部分地方春麦较差外，一般生长得仍不错。
    在夏收中，各机关、学校、团体、部队、工矿企业都派出大批人员支援夏收，形成各行各业全面支援农业的新高潮。
    据新华社西宁讯　青海省的春小麦和青稞由平川向山区、由东南部向西北部次第黄熟，各族人民在管好晚熟田的同时，开展抢收和复种工作。
    去冬今春青海省垦植了大量荒地，使春小麦和青稞的播种面积扩大了三分之二以上。在抢收春麦、青稞的斗争中，由于川水地区和山地的春麦和青稞成熟期迟早不同，各人民公社普遍根据等价交换原则，组织山地与川地之间的大协作。乐都县洪水公社两个川水地区的大队麦田已经黄熟，成熟期还差一个月的两个山区大队就抽调劳力组成四个支援远征队，携带工具，下山到川水地区支援抢收，使早熟地区做到随黄随割。
    成熟较晚的西北部和新垦地区的各族人民在加强后期田间管理力争高产的同时，正在积极进行收割的准备工作。（附图片）
