Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 19th: Li Yufu, the First Secretary of the Party Committee of Shiqiao Commune in Guang'an County, Sichuan Province, is thrifty and frugal in everything he does, leading the masses in adhering to the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily. Now, a good atmosphere of considering diligence and thrift as glorious and extravagance and waste as shameful has been formed among the cadres and masses of the entire commune. Recently, the Nanchong Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the vast number of cadres to learn from Li Yufu.

Li Yufu came to Shiqiao Commune in 1958, when it was first established, to serve as the Party Committee Secretary. At that time, some cadres believed that with the establishment of the commune, the economic strength had become strong and that things should be handled in a "generous" manner, and that there was no need to be "petty" and "nitpicking." Therefore, they advocated building new office buildings and large auditoriums; some suggested spending more than 10,000 yuan to build a breeding farm. Li Yufu attached great importance to this situation and immediately raised it for discussion at the Party Committee meeting. The discussion concluded that this was not in line with the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily, and it was decided not to do it. Subsequently, a debate was launched among the cadres on the question: "Is this in line with the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily? Is it beneficial to production?". During the debate, Li Yufu repeatedly explained to the cadres that diligence and thrift were very important for our socialist construction, and that ostentation and extravagance were not only extremely detrimental to the development of production, but also would seriously alienate us from the masses. At the same time, he guided everyone to carefully calculate how much grain could be produced by saving expenses, and influenced everyone with his own exemplary actions. He took the lead in moving sand and building walls, and together with everyone, renovated a dilapidated house into an office, and built a breeding farm that could raise more than 500 pigs in a simple manner. The extravagant and wasteful thinking of some cadres in Shiqiao Commune was thus corrected in a timely manner.

Under the influence of Li Yufu's hard-working and simple style, Shiqiao Commune managed to do things simply, spend less money and do more, and be careful in every aspect. In the past two years, the commune's production has developed greatly, but administrative management costs have been greatly reduced. Last year alone, it saved more than 360 yuan compared to the stipulated target.

Shiqiao Commune not only saves administrative management costs, but also strives to save production expenses. Li Yufu often educates cadres to reduce production costs as much as possible. This spring, the number of silkworms raised in the commune increased greatly, requiring the production of more than 30,000 new tools. Li Yufu asked each management area to organize bamboo ware production teams and mobilize commune members to rush to produce the tools. In just half a month, all the required tools were produced, saving the commune more than 10,000 yuan in funds. Based on this experience, now many tools and farm implements needed for agricultural and sideline production in each management area, such as baskets, mats, and water scoops, are produced and used locally, without being purchased from outside, saving the commune a large amount of expenses. In previous years, the purchase of fertilizer was the largest item of expenditure in production costs. Li Yufu believed that in order to reduce production costs, the fertilizer problem must be solved. Therefore, on the one hand, he led the masses to accumulate and manufacture fertilizer in a big way, and on the other hand, through organizing and mobilizing the masses, he established local fertilizer plants in the commune and management areas, producing a large amount of fertilizer, which not only saved funds but also solved the difficulty of lacking fertilizer, thus greatly reducing production costs.

Since Li Yufu came to Shiqiao Commune, he has always led by example, endured hardship first and enjoyed comfort later, and has always insisted on eating, living, working, and consulting with commune members. He always participates in production while inspecting production, and wherever he goes, he works with the commune members there. He does more than 20 workdays per month. Commune meetings are generally held in management areas and production teams, and research is conducted in conjunction with production. Under the education of the Party and the influence of Li Yufu, the cadres of Shiqiao Commune have developed a good style of sharing weal and woe with the masses.

Due to the leadership of the Commune Party Committee headed by Li Yufu, adhering to the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily, Shiqiao Commune has changed its long-term backwardness. In 1959 alone, administrative management costs were reduced by more than 10%, saving the commune a large amount of funds. (Attached picture)

    四川广安县石桥公社干部勤俭节约成风气
    李玉福以身作则和社员同甘共苦
    据新华社成都19日电　四川广安县石桥公社党委第一书记李玉福，处处克勤克俭，领导群众坚持勤俭办社。现在在全社干部、群众中已形成了以勤俭朴素为光荣、以奢侈浪费为耻辱的优良风气。最近，中共南充地委号召广大干部向李玉福学习。
    李玉福是在1958年石桥公社刚建立时，到这里担任党委书记职务的。那时，有的干部认为建立了公社，经济力量雄厚了，办事应该“大方”些，不必再“小手小脚，斤斤计较”。因此，主张修新办公楼、建大礼堂；有的建议花一万多元修饲养场。李玉福很重视这些情况，立即在党委会上提出讨论，讨论结果认为这是不符合勤俭办社方针的，决定不办。接着，就在干部中辩论这样的问题：“这样办合不合勤俭办社的方针？对生产有没有好处？”。在辩论中，李玉福反复向干部说明：勤俭节约对我们建设社会主义十分重要，讲排场、闹阔气不仅对发展生产极其不利，并且会严重脱离群众。同时，他还引导大家细算节约开支能增产多少粮食的账，并以自己的模范行动来影响大家。他带头搬砂筑墙，和大家一起把一幢破烂的民房整修成办公室，并因陋就简地修好了一个能养五百多头猪的饲养场。石桥公社一些干部的铺张浪费思想，因而及时得到纠正。
    在李玉福艰苦朴素作风的影响下，石桥公社做到了因陋就简，少花钱多办事，处处都精打细算。近两年，公社生产大发展，行政管理费用却反而大大减少，仅去年一年就比规定指标节约了三百六十多元。
    石桥公社不仅节约行政管理费用，生产开支也力求节省。李玉福经常教育干部，要尽一切可能降低生产成本。今年春天，社里养蚕数量增加很多，需要新制三万多件工具。李玉福就要求各管理区组织竹器生产小组，发动社员赶制工具，仅半个月时间就把需用工具都制了出来，为公社节约了一万多元资金。根据这一经验，现在，各管理区农副业生产所需的箩筐、围席、戽斗等许多工具农具，都作到自产自用，不向外购买，为公社节约了很大一笔开支。往年，购买肥料是生产费用中最大的一项开支。李玉福认为，要降低生产成本，必须解决肥料问题。于是，一面带领群众大积大造肥料，一面通过组织发动群众，在公社和管理区都开办了土化肥厂，生产了大批肥料，既节约了资金，又解决了缺肥的困难，这样就使生产成本大大降低。
    李玉福到石桥公社以来，处处以身作则，吃苦在先，享福在后，一直坚持和社员同吃同住同劳动同商量。他总是一边检查生产，一边参加生产，走到那里，就在那里和社员一起劳动。他每月做的劳动日在二十个以上。公社的会议一般都到管理区和生产队召开，结合生产进行研究。在党的教育和李玉福的影响下，石桥公社的干部都养成了与群众同甘共苦的优良作风。
    由于在以李玉福为首的公社党委会的领导下，坚持了勤俭办社的方针，石桥公社已经改变了过去长期落后的面貌。1959年，仅行政管理费用就减少10％以上，为公社节约了大批资金。（附图片）
