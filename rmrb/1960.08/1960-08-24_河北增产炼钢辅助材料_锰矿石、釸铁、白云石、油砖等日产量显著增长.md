Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin -- While increasing the production of major steelmaking raw materials, the metallurgical mining system in Hebei Province is actively developing the production of auxiliary raw materials and materials for steelmaking, such as ferromanganese, silicon iron, asphalt, dolomite, limestone, and oil bricks, to support the overall leap forward in steel production.

In order to ensure the overall leap forward in steel production, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has listed increasing the production of auxiliary raw materials as an important current task, calling on workers in the province's metallurgy and mining systems to rely on their own efforts, work hard, and strive to increase the production of auxiliary raw materials and materials for steelmaking. In accordance with the requirements of the Provincial Party Committee, various localities, in addition to restoring and building a number of auxiliary raw material mines, more than ten existing mines, such as manganese mines, dolomite mines, fluorite mines, and limestone mines, are actively mobilizing the masses to accelerate technological transformation and develop production through self-reliance. More than 4,000 employees of the Changcheng Manganese Mine Company in this province dare to think and dare to act, and constantly promote new technologies and new processes on a large scale. In the case of insufficient materials and technical strength, they have recently repaired and manufactured three generators to equip the mine. At present, the daily output of manganese ore has more than doubled compared with the beginning of the year. The workers of the Leizhuang Stone Mine in Luan County carried forward the spirit of "poor sticks" and vigorously carried out mine transportation construction, so that a large amount of limestone piled up in the mountain fields and mine entrances was quickly transported out of the mountain. The output of limestone has also increased from 400 tons to about 2,000 tons, which fully supplies the Tangshan and Tianjin steel plants.

Workers in departments producing asphalt, ferromanganese, silicon iron, and refractory materials are also doing everything possible to increase production. The employees of the province's coking system put forward the slogan of "taking asphalt as the key link and vigorously carrying out the comprehensive utilization of coal tar," and are vigorously promoting the experience of external kettle dehydration of coal tar processing created by the Qinhuangdao Coking Plant. After the promotion of this experience, the coal tar distillation time can be shortened by half, and the asphalt output will be increased by more than two times. In order to expand the production capacity of asphalt and meet the needs of steelmaking, a new part of processing equipment has been added throughout the province. Tangshan City, the main producing area of refractory materials in Hebei Province, has also recently adjusted its strength to strengthen the production of refractory materials for steelmaking.

The relevant leading departments have also recently formed groups composed of leading cadres and technicians to go deep into silver mines, fluorite, dolomite, and coking plants and mines to effectively solve the key problems in the production of auxiliary raw materials. The group that went deep into the Tangshan Coking Plant found that the coal tar output was low due to cracks in the recovery pipeline. They immediately transferred five tons of welding pipes for replacement and helped solve some technical operation problems, which doubled the asphalt output. Cadres dispatched by the Hedong District Committee of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, aiming at the key problem that the calcination capacity of the oil brick workshop of the Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant was insufficient and affected steel production, organized more than 300 employees from the No. 3 and No. 5 Cotton Textile Factories and the Oil and Fat Chemical Factory in early August to build more than 40 indigenous calcination furnaces overnight, breaking through the weak links and ensuring the rise in steel production in early August.

Because the leadership was in-depth and the key problems were solved in a timely manner, since August, although it has suffered several heavy rains, the output of manganese ore, silicon iron, dolomite, and oil bricks for steelmaking in the province has still greatly increased compared with the average daily output in July, with silicon iron increasing by 6.9% and oil bricks increasing by 2.85%.

### 河北增产炼钢辅助材料  锰矿石、釸铁、白云石、油砖等日产量显著增长

    河北增产炼钢辅助材料
    锰矿石、釸铁、白云石、油砖等日产量显著增长
    新华社天津电　河北省冶金矿山系统在增产炼钢主要原料的同时，积极发展锰铁、釸铁、沥青、白云石、石灰石、油砖等炼钢辅助原料材料的生产，支援钢铁生产全面跃进。
    中共河北省委为了确保钢铁生产全面跃进，已把增产辅助原料列为当前的一项重要工作，号召全省冶金、矿山系统职工自力更生，发奋图强，努力增产炼钢用辅助原料、材料。各地根据省委的要求，除正在恢复和新建一批辅助原料矿山外，现有的锰矿、白云石、萤石、石灰石等十多个矿山，都在积极发动群众自力更生加速技术改造，发展生产。这个省的长城锰矿公司四千余名职工敢想敢干，不断地大量推广新工艺、新技术，在材料、技术力量不足的情况下，最近修理和制造了三台发电机，装备了矿山。现在，锰矿石日产量已比年初增长了一倍多。滦县雷庄石矿职工发扬“穷棒子”精神，大搞矿山运输建设，使过去堆放在山场、圹口的大量石灰石很快运出了山，石灰石产量也由四百吨提高到目前的二千吨左右，充分供应了唐山和天津钢厂。
    生产沥青、锰铁、釸铁、耐火器材等部门的职工也在千方百计增加生产。全省炼焦系统职工提出了“以沥青为纲，大搞焦油综合利用”的口号，正在大力推广秦皇岛焦厂创造的焦油加工釜外脱水的经验。这个经验推广后，焦油蒸馏时间可以缩短一半，沥青产量将增加二倍多。为了扩大沥青的生产能力，满足炼钢需要，全省新增加了一部分加工设备。河北省耐火器材的主要产地——唐山市，最近也调整了力量，加强炼钢用耐火器材的生产。
    有关领导部门最近还纷纷组成由领导干部和技术人员参加的小组，分别深入银矿、萤石、白云石和炼焦等厂矿，切实解决辅助原料生产中的关键问题。深入唐山焦化厂的小组，在参加生产中发现由于回收管道有裂缝，焦油产量低，立即调拨了五吨焊接管替换，并且帮助解决了一些技术操作问题，使沥青产量提高了一倍左右。中共天津河东区委派出的干部针对天津第二钢厂油砖车间锻烧能力不足、影响炼钢生产的关键，在8月初组织棉纺三厂、五厂、油脂化学厂等单位，抽调了三百多名职工，连夜突击建成土锻烧炉四十多座，突破了薄弱环节，保证了8月上旬钢产量的上升。
    由于领导深入，关键问题解决得及时，8月份以来，虽然遭到几次大雨，但全省炼钢用锰矿石、釸铁、白云石、油砖等产量仍比7月份平均日产量有很大增长，其中釸铁增长了6.9％，油砖增长了2.85％。（附图片）
