New Stamps

    To commemorate the convocation of the Third Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications issued a set of two commemorative stamps entitled "The Third Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers" on July 30.
    The first stamp (4 fen) takes the commemorative badge "Worker-Peasant-Soldier" of this Congress as its theme. It indicates that since the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," China's revolutionary literature and art has been advancing along the correct direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    The second stamp (8 fen) takes the gold and stone inscription "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" as its theme. "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is the best policy formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong based on China's specific conditions for developing China's science and literature and art, which is not only completely correct in theory, but also has proven to be completely correct in practical work.

    新邮票
    为了纪念中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会的召开。邮电部在7月30日发行了“中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会”纪念邮票一套共二枚。
    第一枚（四分）以这次文代大会纪念章“工农兵”为主题。表示我国的革命文学艺术，从毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表以来，一直沿着文艺为工农兵服务的正确方向前进。
    第二枚（八分）以金石“百花齐放、百家争鸣”为主题。百花齐放百家争鸣是毛泽东同志根据我国的具体条件所制定的发展我国科学和文学艺术的最好政策，这不但在理论上是完全正确的，在实际工作中也证明是完全正确的。
