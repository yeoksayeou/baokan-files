Strengthening Ideological Work, Improving Labor Management
Fengcheng Improves Labor Efficiency of New Agricultural Workers

(Our dispatch) Since labor forces have been concentrated on the agricultural front, how can we raise the production enthusiasm and labor efficiency of the large number of laborers from all walks of life? Fengcheng County, Jiangxi Province, has successfully solved this problem by strengthening ideological work and improving labor management.

Of the 200,000 laborers who participated in the summer harvest and planting in Fengcheng County this year, 55,000 were newly transferred from cities and other industries. Many of them did not have sufficient understanding of the importance of agriculture, and some were not familiar with agricultural production techniques. In response to this situation, the county party committee and the party committees of various communes vigorously conducted ideological education on agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, raising their understanding of the importance of agricultural production. At the same time, the heads of party and Youth League organizations in various communes, production brigades, and production teams established a system of contact with them by area, household, and individual, earnestly solving some of the problems they raised and providing them with care in their lives.

It is very important to organize the newly participating agricultural labor force effectively. Fengcheng County adopted the organizational method of having experienced workers mainly perform complex labor, new workers mainly perform simple labor, and women mainly take care of living welfare. At the beginning, due to the failure to distinguish between physical strength and technical skills, and only simple interspersed grouping, the experienced workers were greatly affected, which affected the improvement of work efficiency; the new workers also faced great pressure, causing many ideological concerns. Later, after the establishment of a household-to-person contact system by cadres at all levels and the extensive solicitation of opinions from the masses, the more complex production processes such as plowing, harrowing, weeding, and transplanting were assigned to experienced workers, and new workers with less strength and poor skills were formed into separate work groups to undertake simpler labor such as pulling seedlings, harvesting, and operating waterwheels; at the same time, male laborers were transferred out of the living welfare organizations, and women who had newly participated in agricultural production were sent in, allowing the canteen cooks and the managers of nurseries and kindergartens to be mainly women. In this way, both new and experienced workers, as well as male and female laborers, could give full play to their expertise, which is conducive to the general improvement of labor efficiency.

Fengcheng County has also widely carried out a campaign of "contracting teaching and contracting learning" between new and old workers, so that every new worker can quickly master various advanced production technologies. Fengcheng County also paid attention to rationally solving the labor remuneration problems of new workers. Among the 55,000 new agricultural laborers in the county, in addition to some workers, cadres, and students who came to support the summer harvest and planting with state wages and only needed food and drink, there were more than 20,000 people who needed to assess labor points and labor remuneration. At the beginning, the failure to solve this problem in a timely manner affected the production enthusiasm of the new workers. Subsequently, each production team, according to the physical strength, production technology, and individual characteristics of the new workers, assessed labor points and remuneration methods through self-reporting and public discussion, which mobilized everyone's production enthusiasm.

### 加强思想工作　改进劳动管理  丰城提高农业新手劳动工效

    加强思想工作　改进劳动管理
    丰城提高农业新手劳动工效
    本报讯　农业战线劳动力集中以后，如何提高来自四面八方的大批劳力的生产热情和劳动工效？江西丰城县从加强思想工作和改进劳动管理着手，成功地解决了这个问题。
    今年丰城县参加夏收夏种的二十万劳动力中，有五万五千人是新从城镇和其他各行各业中调集出来的。他们之中有许多人对农业的重要性认识不足，部分人还不熟悉农业生产技术。县委和各公社党委针对这种情况，大张旗鼓地进行了农业是国民经济基础的思想教育，提高他们对农业生产重要性的认识。同时，各公社、生产大队、生产队的党团组织的负责人，都分片分户分人和他们建立联系制度，切实地解决他们所提出的一些问题，并在生活上加以照顾。
    把新参加农业生产的劳力，加以很好的组织起来是一项很重要的工作。丰城县采取了复杂劳动以老手为主，简单劳动以新手为主，生活福利以妇女为主的组织方法。开始时，由于未区别体力强弱、技术高低，仅是简单的插花编组，因而对老手牵扯很多，影响了工效提高；对新手也有很大压力，造成许多思想顾虑。后来，经过各级干部建立分户分人联系制度，广泛征求群众的意见，把耕、耙、耘、插等较为复杂的生产工序，划归老手担任，把力弱、技术差的新手单独编成作业组，由他们担负拔秧、收割、车水等比较简单的劳动；同时又把男劳动力从生活福利组织中调出来，把新参加农业生产的妇女派进去，让食堂炊事员和托儿所、幼儿园的管理人员，都以妇女为主办起来。这样，无论新手、老手和男女劳动力，都能发挥自己的专长，有利于劳动工效的普遍提高。
    丰城县还在新老手之间广泛地开展包教包学运动，使每个新手都很快掌握各种先进的生产技术。丰城县还注意合理解决新手的劳动报酬问题。全县新参加农业劳动的五万五千多人中，除部分拿国家工薪来支援夏收夏种的工人、干部和只要供给饮食的学生外，还有二万多人是要评定劳动工分和劳动报酬的。开始，由于这个问题没有及时解决，影响了新手的生产积极性。随后，各生产队即根据新手的体力强弱、生产技术高低和个人特长，以自报公议的方法，评定了劳动工分和计酬办法，这样就调动了每个人的生产积极性。
