    Heroic Struggle for Lofty Ideals
    —Watching the Korean Film "Cherish the Future"
    Wu Yuan
    "Mount Paektu! Mount Paektu! The mountain peak of the motherland! The anti-Japanese guerrillas grew up in your broad embrace." The Korean film "Cherish the Future" begins its story of the heroic struggle of the anti-Japanese guerrillas in this way.

    The Korean people love their motherland, and they also love Mount Paektu. Mount Paektu is the headquarters of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army and guerrillas led by Comrade Kim Il-sung against the Japanese imperialist aggression, and the place where Comrade Kim Il-sung resides. It is the heart of the Korean people's revolutionary struggle and the hope of the Korean people.

    We see from the film that, with the help of the Party and the masses, Ji-shan escapes from the enemy's prison and heads to Mount Paektu to join the guerrillas. He and Yong-nan and Hyun-soon travel through mountains and rivers for more than fifty days of arduous journey. They sleep in thorns and accompany wild animals, and wild fruits and grass roots are their only food. Although the road is long and the difficulties are heavy, their unwavering confidence is to climb to Mount Paektu. They rush to Mount Paektu, "not only to fight for the liberation of the motherland today, but also to build a communist society in the future." Countless guerrillas wrote a glorious page in their lives in the anti-enemy struggle of Mount Paektu. Ji-shan, a brave and unyielding fighter who grew up under the education of the Party, is one of them.

    Ji-shan is a young man who loves his motherland and has lofty revolutionary ideals, but he doesn't know how to fight the enemy. He once exposed his identity among the masses for hitting a puppet policeman who bullied the people. He went to rob a bank to support the guerrillas. It was the Party that educated him to always remember that he is a Communist Youth League member and to listen to the Party. It is difficult to win by blindly taking adventurous actions to deal with the enemy. The sacrifice of Ji-shan's brother strengthened his revolutionary confidence even more. Therefore, he was determined to go to Mount Paektu. In the battle, he gradually developed into a brave commander.

    Comrade Kim Il-sung's words: "When the motherland presents a new face in twenty years, the future life of our people will be happy and glorious. We must cherish our future, we must fight for the future, and we must have lofty ideals." inspire him and his comrades to fight bravely and move forward continuously. Therefore, when his eyes were injured in the battle, he was not pessimistic or discouraged, showing a high degree of revolutionary optimism. Under the care of the Party, his eyes finally recovered. We see from the film that after Ji-shan saw the mountains and rivers of the motherland again, he rolled in the woods like a child, cheering loudly. He and his lover Hyun-soon excitedly narrated their ideals, expressing their determination to fight: "Cherish the future, give everything to exchange for our future, our future is bright!"

    Great revolutionary ideals gave him great strength, making him have a tenacious fighting will and a noble spirit of self-sacrifice. Once, after he gloriously completed his combat mission, he was unfortunately surrounded by the enemy in order to cover the safe retreat of the team. However, he, fifty-year-old Ginseng, and twenty-year-old Zhong-hao continued to fight unyieldingly with the enemy in prison. They firmly believe that "imperialists are like dew in the sun and will surely perish." They deeply understand that revolution is a bright road, "Life can be sacrificed, but revolution cannot be abandoned. Cherish the future, it is so great! Our blood will irrigate the future of the motherland, a large garden full of socialist flowers, a communist garden." Lofty and magnificent revolutionary ideals inspire the people in struggle to fight with confidence. We see from the film that the enemy wanted to subdue Ji-shan and brutally used torture on Ji-shan's mother. When the enemy used a branding iron to brand his mother's arm, Ji-shan closed his eyes. The noble revolutionary mother wanted her son to open his eyes and remember the hatred of the enemy. She watched her son heroically go to justice, she did not cry, he wants to continue the fight. This is the image of thousands of Korean revolutionary mothers. We also saw the Communist Party member Ji-shan, Ginseng, and the Communist Youth League member Zhong-hao, who became more and more determined by various tortures of the enemy. Twenty-year-old Zhong-hao applied to join the party before his death and was gloriously approved, achieving his lofty wish. They were born great and died gloriously.

    The blood of revolutionary fighters was not shed in vain, and their great revolutionary ideals are now being gradually realized. In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which defeated Japanese fascism and won a complete victory, under the leadership of the Workers' Party, it is striding on the Chollima, galloping on the road of socialist revolution and construction. For the communist future of the motherland, for the peace and unity of the motherland, the Korean people are waging a tenacious struggle against American imperialism and reactionaries, striving to build the motherland into a socialist and communist garden.

    The film, with simple and concise artistic generalizations, depicts the heroic and tenacious revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary soldiers who shed blood and sacrificed for the happy tomorrow of the motherland under the guidance of the Party and in the arduous guerrilla warfare environment, and also shows the flesh-and-blood friendship and internationalist spirit of the Chinese and Korean people fighting side by side and fighting back against aggressors. "Cherish the Future" will inspire us to advance more bravely on the road of revolution.

    为崇高的理想而英勇斗争
    ——看朝鲜影片《要爱未来》
    吴渊
    “白头山！白头山！祖国的山峰呵！抗日游击队在你那宽阔的胸怀里成长。”朝鲜影片《要爱未来》就这样开始了它的关于抗日游击队英勇斗争的故事。
    朝鲜人民热爱祖国，也热爱白头山，白头山是金日成同志领导的反对日本帝国主义侵略的朝鲜人民革命军和游击队的司令部，是金日成同志居住的地方。它是朝鲜人民革命斗争的心脏，也是朝鲜人民的希望。
    我们从影片中看到，吉山，在党和群众的帮助下，逃出敌人的囚笼，奔向白头山，参加游击队。他和永男、贤顺跋山涉水走过了五十多天的艰难的路程。他们睡在荆棘丛中和野兽作伴，野果和草根是他们唯一的食粮。路途虽然遥远，困难虽然重重，但是一心要攀到白头山，这是他们坚定不移的信心。他们奔赴白头山，“不仅是在今日为解放祖国而斗争，而且还为了将来建设共产主义社会。”无数游击队员们就在白头山的抗敌斗争中，写下了他们生命中光辉的一页。吉山这个在党的教育下成长起来的英勇不屈的战士，就是其中的一个。
    吉山是热爱祖国，有远大革命理想的青年，但是他不懂得怎样去和敌人进行斗争。他曾经因为打一个欺侮老百姓的伪警，在群众中暴露了自己的身份，他为了支援游击队去抢银行。是党教育他，随时要记住自己是一个共青团员，要听党的话。盲目地采取冒险的行动去对付敌人是很难取得胜利的。吉山的哥哥的牺牲，更加坚定了他的革命的信心。因此他一心要奔到白头山。在战斗中，他逐渐锻炼成一个英勇的指挥员。
    金日成同志的话：“等到二十年后，祖国要呈现一个新面貌，我们人民将来的生活是美满的光辉的，我们要热爱我们的未来，我们要为未来而斗争，要有远大的理想。”鼓舞他和同志们英勇斗争，不断前进。因此，当他在战斗中双目负伤以后，毫不悲观，也不沮丧，表现了高度的革命乐观主义精神。在党的关怀下，他的眼睛终于复明了。我们从影片中看到：吉山重见祖国的山河后，他像孩子似地高兴得在树林里打滚，大声呼喊。他和爱人贤顺兴奋地叙述着自己的理想，表示着自己斗争的决心：“要爱未来，要付出一切换取我们的未来，我们的未来是光辉灿烂的！”
    伟大的革命理想给予了他巨大的力量，使他有着顽强的战斗意志，具有崇高的舍己为人的牺牲精神。一次他光荣地完成了战斗任务以后，为了掩护队伍安全撤退，不幸被敌人包围。但是他和五十岁的人参、二十岁的钟浩，在狱中和敌人继续进行着不屈不挠的斗争。他们坚信“帝国主义者就像阳光下的露水，一定灭亡。”他们深深懂得革命是光明的道路，“生命可以牺牲，但不能抛弃革命。要爱未来，它是多么的伟大！我们的血，将会浇灌祖国的未来，那是开满社会主义花朵的大花园，共产主义的花园。”崇高而壮丽的革命理想，鼓舞着斗争中的人们，满怀信心地斗争。我们从影片中看到：敌人想使吉山屈服，残暴地对吉山的母亲使用酷刑。当敌人用烙铁来烙母亲的臂膀的时候，吉山闭上了眼睛。崇高的革命母亲，她要儿子睁开眼睛，记住敌人的仇恨。她目送儿子英勇就义，她不哭，他要继续斗争。这是千百个朝鲜革命母亲的形象。我们也看到受到敌人各种折磨而愈益坚决的共产党员吉山、人参和共青团员钟浩。二十岁的钟浩在就义前还申请入党，被光荣地批准，达到了自己崇高的愿望。他们生得伟大，死得光荣。
    革命战士的鲜血没有白流，他们伟大的革命理想现在正在逐步实现。在打垮日本法西斯取得彻底胜利的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，在劳动党的领导下，正跨上千里马，在社会主义革命和建设的道路上飞驰。为了祖国的共产主义的未来，为了祖国的和平和统一，朝鲜人民正进行着顽强的反对美国帝国主义和反动派的斗争，为把祖国建设成社会主义、共产主义的大花园而努力。
    影片以朴实、简洁的艺术概括，描绘了在党的教导下，在艰苦的游击战争环境中，为了祖国的幸福的明天，流血牺牲的革命战士们英勇顽强的革命精神，也表现了中朝人民并肩战斗、反击侵略者的血肉情谊、国际主义精神。《要爱未来》将鼓舞我们在革命的道路上更加奋勇前进。
