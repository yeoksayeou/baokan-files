Chongqing has built many gravity cableways without power equipment in many ports, wharves, mines, and iron factories, improving transportation efficiency and freeing the porters from the heavy labor of climbing slopes.
(Our newspaper, Chongqing, 9th dispatch) Recently, Chongqing has built gravity cableways, which do not require power, have high transportation efficiency, and large capacity, on many loading and unloading operation lines on both sides of the Yangtze River and in mines and blast furnace groups. According to incomplete statistics, the city has built more than 400 cableways of various types, with a total length of more than 40,000 meters. In places where these cableways have been built, transportation labor has been saved by about two-thirds. Compared with manual handling, the daily transportation volume has increased by more than three times, the work efficiency has increased by about ten times, and the loading and unloading time of vehicles and ships has been greatly shortened.

Gravity cableways are built according to the characteristics of the mountainous city's high port shore, steep slopes, and small operating hinterland, based on the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay. The structure of this kind of cableway is: the track is laid on a steep slope, the upper end is equipped with a drum and brakes, and the cable around the drum drags a loading hopper up and down. Using the gravity of the object itself, the heavy car slides down and brings up the light car, and the gravity cableway starts to operate. This kind of cableway is especially suitable for transportation lines with rugged mountain roads and steep slopes. The Chongqing Nan'an Iron Factory to Quanshan Coal Mine originally had to bypass a mountain with an altitude of 560 meters, and it was very inconvenient to transport coal, coke, and ore back and forth. Recently, this mine built five cableways from the mountain, connected to a 5,000-meter-long earthen railway, changing the past phenomenon of "carrying on shoulders, climbing mountains and ridges, ants moving house, and endless streams" in the transportation of raw materials. At the Chongqing Mudong Wharf, it used to take two people fifteen minutes to carry a package of salt uphill; after the gravity cableway was built, it only takes three minutes to load six packages of salt up the hillside. What used to take eighty people a whole day at this wharf can now be done by only forty people in thirty minutes.

Now, several major ports and wharves in Chongqing have built clusters of cableways, making full use of the mountainous terrain and basically changing the situation that porters in Chongqing have been climbing slopes and carrying heavy physical labor for many years. The wharf porters wrote poems praising: "The mass movement shows its power, 'Four Modernizations' flowers are all red: the cable car flies like a shuttle, the trough slides, and the wharf transportation is connected in all directions; carrying poles and shoulder poles have entered the warehouse, and heavy labor has become easy. The technical revolution is a great victory, and the plan is completed with great success!"

In the mass movement of gravity cableway construction, the workers in Chongqing have demonstrated great enthusiasm and creativity. Liu Fuqing, a porter and Communist Party member in the Fourth Operating Area of the Chongqing Port Authority, continuously overcame difficulties in the process of participating in the trial production of gravity cableways, failing six times before finally succeeding in the trial production. The Shimen Wharf was short of stones for building the cableway and building the fortress wall. In one night, the workers found more than 360 stones. The six major cableways at the Chongqing Caiyuanba Wharf (including the recently converted electric cable cars) were quickly built through a vigorous mass movement. Originally, Caiyuanba only had one gravity cableway. This year, in the mass movement of mechanizing loading and unloading, five cableways were built in a rush in more than a month, fundamentally changing the backward phenomenon of climbing slopes by carrying on shoulders and by human labor, and enabling the entire wharf to realize the mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation of transportation and loading and unloading. The number of employees has been reduced from more than 4,000 to about 1,000, but the transportation volume from January to June this year has increased by more than five times compared with the same period last year.

Now, the employees of various wharves in Chongqing are vigorously carrying out the "upgrading" of gravity cableways, that is: on the one hand, the various tools connected to the two ends of the cableway are matched into a dragon and serialized to improve the transportation efficiency of the cableway; on the other hand, in order to adapt to the situation of less unloading and more loading, motors are added to the gravity cableways and driven by electricity, so that the transportation efficiency of these cableways can be increased by one-third to one-half on the original basis.

### 重庆利用陡坡大建缆车道  许多港口码头、矿山、铁厂建起了不用动力设备的重力缆车  提高了运输效率，解脱了搬运工人爬坡运输的笨重劳动

    重庆利用陡坡大建缆车道
    许多港口码头、矿山、铁厂建起了不用动力设备的重力缆车
    提高了运输效率，解脱了搬运工人爬坡运输的笨重劳动
    本报重庆9日电　重庆市最近在长江两岸和矿山、高炉群的许多装卸搬运作业线上，修建了不用动力、运效高、运量大的重力缆车。据不完全统计，全市已修建重力缆车等各种缆车道四百余条，长达四万多米。修建了这种缆车的地方，运输劳动力节约了三分之二左右，同人力搬运时比较，日运量增长了三倍多，工效提高十倍左右，大大缩短了车船装卸时间。
    重力缆车是根据山城港口岸高、坡陡、作业腹地狭小的特点，本着土洋结合，以土为主的原则修建起来的。这种缆车的结构是：轨道铺设在陡坡上，上端装置滚筒和刹车，绕过滚筒的缆绳拖着一上一下的装车漏斗，利用物体本身的重力作用，重车下滑时就带上轻车，重力缆车就运转起来。这种缆车特别适用于山路崎岖、坡陡的运输线。重庆南岸铁厂到泉山煤矿，原来要绕过一座拔海五百六十米的山，往来搬运煤、焦、矿石很不方便。最近，这个矿从山上修了五条缆车道，同五千米长的土铁路衔接起来，改变了过去原材料运输“肩挑背抬，翻山越岭，蚂蚁搬家，川流不息”的现象。重庆木洞码头，原来运输一包食盐，要两个人抬着上坡走十五分钟；自修建了重力缆车以后，只需三分钟时间即可装六包盐吊上山坡。原来这个码头八十个人干一整天的活，现在只需四十个人用三十分钟就可以完成。
    现在，重庆市的几个主要港口码头，都修建了成群的缆车道，使山坡地势得到充分利用，基本上改变了重庆市码头搬运工人多年以来爬坡搬运，体力劳动繁重的状况。码头搬运工人们写诗赞道：“群众运动显威风，‘四化’鲜花一片红：缆车如飞梭槽滑，码头运输四面通；杠子扁担入了库，笨重劳动变轻松。技术革命大胜利，计划完成立大功！”
    重庆市的工人们在大搞重力缆车化运动中，发挥了极大的积极性和创造性。重庆港务局第四作业区搬运工人、共产党员刘福清，在参加试制重力缆车过程中，不断克服困难，先后失败了六次，终于试制成功。石门码头修缆车砌堡坎缺石头，在一个晚上，工人就找了三百六十多条石头。重庆菜园坝码头的六大条缆车道（包括最近改装成的电力缆车在内），就是通过大搞群众运动迅速修成的。原来菜园坝只有一条重力缆车，今年在大搞全民装卸搬运机械化运动中，又用了一个多月的时间突击修建了五条缆车道，从根本上改变了爬坡运输用肩挑、人抬的落后现象，使整个码头实现了运输装卸机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化。职工人数由四千多人减少为一千人左右，今年1至6月份的运输量却比去年同期增长了五倍多。
    现在，重庆市各码头的职工正在大搞重力缆车“升级”，即：一方面将缆车两头衔接的各种工具配套成龙，系列化，提高缆车运输效率；另一方面，为了适应下货少上货多的情况，将重力缆车加上马达，利用电力带动，使这些缆车的运输效率可在原有基础上提高三分之一到二分之一。（附图片）
