    Ship-Port Collaboration Improves Loading and Unloading Efficiency
    The "Peace 44" ship travels on a circular route between Shanghai and Dalian. According to old habits, the sailors' task was considered complete once the ship docked. Recently, we have taken proactive measures to actively cooperate with the port to achieve fast loading and unloading, thereby shortening the ship's time in port and improving transportation efficiency. These measures are: 1. Before the ship enters the port, we notify the port of the ship's arrival time, the types of goods being loaded, and the placement of various goods in the holds, so that the port can prepare the corresponding manpower and equipment in a timely manner; 2. Before the ship approaches the dock, we adjust the ship's derricks, winches, and other lifting equipment in advance, and open the hatch covers. This way, unloading can begin as soon as the ship arrives at the port, saving the port forty minutes of unloading preparation time; 3. We have established a technical guidance group to ensure rational allocation of goods of different shapes and natures, with all goods properly marked. This enables dockworkers to unload in an orderly manner, and also better leverages the characteristics of various mechanical equipment, improving their efficiency; 4. To help dockworkers load and unload scattered goods in batches, we have manufactured many grouped loading and unloading tools. When loading, we use these tools to bundle, contain, or pad the scattered goods, so that they can be lifted out in groups and batches using cranes during unloading. This generally increases efficiency by about one-fold, solving the problem of slow unloading of scattered goods; 5. When there is a shortage of dockworkers, the captain, political commissar, and crew members often participate in voluntary labor, opening a hatch and utilizing the ship's loading and unloading equipment to rush the unloading of goods.
    Thanks to our close cooperation with the port, our ship's time in port this year has been shortened by an average of more than two hours compared to last year.

    船港协作提高装卸效率
    和平44号轮船，是在上海—大连线上循环航行的。按老习惯，轮船靠上码头，船员就等于完成了任务。最近，我们采取了积极措施，主动配合港口快装快运，因而缩短了船只在港时间，提高了运输效率。这些措施是：一、轮船进港之前，通知港口轮船到港时间、装载货物的品种以及各种货物的放置舱位，以便港口及时准备相应的人力和设备；二、轮船还没有靠近码头的时候，我们先把船上的吊杆、起货机等吊装设备调整好，同时把舱口盖打开，这样，船一到港，就可开始卸货，给港口节省四十分钟的卸货准备时间；三、我们成立了技术指导小组，作到不同形状，不同性质的货物合理配载，各种货物都做好标记，这样使码头工人卸货秩序有条不紊，同时能更好地发挥各种机械设备的特点，提高使用效率；四、为了帮助码头工人成批装卸零散货物，我们制造了许多成组装卸机具，在装船的时候，把零散货物用机具捆起来或盛起来、垫起来，卸船的时候，便可以用起重机器成组成批地吊出来，效率一般都能提高一倍左右，解决了零散货物卸船速度慢的问题；五、在码头装卸工人不足的情况下，船长、政委和船员，经常参加义务劳动，打开一个舱口，利用船上的装卸设备，突击卸货。
    由于我们和港口紧密协作，今年以来，我们船的在港时间，比去年平均缩短了两小时以上。
