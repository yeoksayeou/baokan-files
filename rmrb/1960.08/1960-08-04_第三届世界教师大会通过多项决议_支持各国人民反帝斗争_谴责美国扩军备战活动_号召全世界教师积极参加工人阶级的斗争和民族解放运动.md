The resolution on Cuba and Latin America stated: In Cuba and Latin America, the struggle against US imperialist aggression and intervention is also developing irresistibly.

Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, August 1st: The Third World Teachers' Conference here today unanimously adopted a resolution on teachers of all countries participating in the struggle for national independence, relaxation of international tensions, peace, and progress. The resolution severely condemned the criminal activities of the imperialists headed by the United States in expanding arms and preparing for war, threatening world peace, and expressed active support for the national democratic movements of the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and resolutely opposed colonialism.

The resolution stated, "The current situation is characterized by the massive struggles of the people of all countries to defend peace, strive for national independence, and progress. The progress of this struggle has caused the imperialist forces to retreat somewhat. The socialist countries are growing stronger year by year. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are constantly struggling to strive for a new life and to liberate themselves from imperialist oppression. The workers in capitalist countries are waging a decisive and heroic struggle for social progress."

The resolution stated, "All mankind sympathizes with the struggle of the people of the African continent. Africa has become an important region of the anti-colonialist movement, thus proving that the era of colonialist chains, prisons, oppression, and exploitation is gone forever."

The resolution condemned the imperialists headed by the United States for establishing various aggressive military blocs and threatening the people of all countries with nuclear bombs.

The resolution believes that "as long as the lives and future of the younger generation remain under threat, we as teachers cannot consider our noble mission of serving humanity to be completed." The resolution said, "We resolutely condemn all actions by the imperialists that lead to the intensification of international tensions. We oppose the imperialists' war propaganda and war preparations, and oppose the establishment and maintenance of military bases in foreign territories, because these bases threaten universal peace."

The resolution stated, "We resolutely demand an immediate end to the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, which threaten people's health and lives. We resolutely condemn the violation of the airspace of sovereign countries and all other military espionage activities."

The resolution believes that "the main task of the people of all countries today is to defend world peace, and one of the main conditions for defending peace is complete and thorough disarmament." The resolution called on all workers to be vigilant.

The resolution stated, "As promoters of progress and culture, we express active support for the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to strive for their own liberation and to build their own schools." The resolution expressed "firm opposition to colonialism, to all oppression of the people of all countries, and to actions that hinder the liberation and economic and cultural progress of the people of all countries," and "warmly supports the struggle of the workers in capitalist countries to strive for their democratic rights, for social progress, and peace." The resolution stated that "it is intolerable for many people to continue to poison the conscience of children with racist and militarist ideas."

The resolution called on teachers around the world, regardless of race, nationality, or political views, to unite and work together with all workers and peace-loving people to defend peace and strive for human progress.

Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, August 1st: The World Teachers' Conference held here today unanimously adopted a letter to teachers of the world.

The letter to teachers calls on teachers of all countries to actively participate in the struggle of the working class and the national liberation movements for independence, and to conduct daily struggles together with all working people and students' parents for the progress of schools and to improve their own living and working conditions.

The letter to teachers stated, we call on you to strengthen the struggle for peace, disarmament, the dismantling of military bases in other countries, against the rearmament of West Germany and Japan, for an end to colonial wars, and for an end to the Algerian war on the basis of first recognizing the Algerian people's right to independence.

The letter to teachers stated that in 1960, a strong liberation movement arose in Africa, liberating the people of many countries from the shackles of colonialism, winning independence, and establishing their own lives.

The letter to teachers stated that we hope that children all over the world will be free from poverty and hunger, and will be able to attend schools and develop their talents. For this, the system of discrimination and exploitation of the people must be eradicated.
