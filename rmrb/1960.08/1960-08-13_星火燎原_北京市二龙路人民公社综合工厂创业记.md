　　A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire
　　——The Story of the Founding of the Erlong Road People's Commune Comprehensive Factory in Beijing
　　By our reporter Sun Shikai
　　Walking through the winding alleyways, you can hear the "ding-ding-dang-dang" sounds. Women in gray work clothes are working hard inside and outside a courtyard.
　　The factory's machine repair workshop, occupying the back yard, is the old factory site where the factory was first established, now greatly changed. The two and a half crooked and low houses are gone. A new factory building has been built on this "founding" place. Comrade Song Ming, who accompanied me on the tour, said enthusiastically, "When a dozen housewives started a factory here from scratch, who could have imagined such a big thing would come of it. Now, there are not only four workshops for installation, stamping, and machine repair, but the number of production personnel has increased to more than 500, becoming a factory with an initial scale. In the past year or so, seven workshops have been successively separated from this factory, with more than 300 production personnel taking some equipment and raw materials, and three other commune-run factories have been formed, and four production groups have been assisted to develop into factories. This comprehensive factory has indeed become a 'single spark that starts a prairie fire' in the Erlong Road People's Commune, laying a good foundation for the development of industry in the commune.

　　Starting a Factory Empty-Handed
　　That was two years ago. After the great rectification movement, the working residents in this area studied the Party's general line for socialist construction, and everyone was eager to "add bricks and tiles" to socialism. The Party organization promptly put forward the call to vigorously develop street production, pointing out the direction for the working residents. Women who were bound by housework rushed out of their homes. At that time, more than a dozen women in the Kouda Hutong and Damucang areas took the lead. Among them were family members of electricians and bricklayers, as well as family members of drivers and shop assistants. With the support of the Party, they were busy day and night setting up a factory.
　　What to produce? After discussing it back and forth, everyone decided to do processing and repairs together, doing whatever work they could find. More than a dozen women, like they were obsessed, went around in the wind and rain, trying to build a factory. They borrowed two and a half rooms from residents as a factory site, asked for a broken table and two benches, and tried to raise more than 100 yuan as capital. In order to develop business, they first installed a telephone to find work and get raw materials.

　　Funds—Accumulated Bit by Bit
　　The factory was opened, but before the sign was even hung up, some people ran out to solicit work, and some people cleaned the "factory building" at home. They first found a timber factory and contacted them several times, only getting the job of painting a dozen wooden boxes. At that time, people were skeptical about the quality of their painting and were unwilling to let them do it. However, this small factory received the first batch of work, although very little, it was considered officially "open" for production. However, each of the women secretly made up their minds: they would rather sweat more to ensure quality, create a brand, and establish credit. In a few days, the first batch of work was delivered, and after the timber factory accepted it, they believed that the quality was up to standard, and then sent more processing work. At this time, the number of boxes to be painted was no longer a dozen at a time, but dozens. Without a spray gun, they used a bicycle air tube to replace it, one person pumping air and one person painting. With more work, the room could not accommodate it, so everyone simply worked in the doorway and courtyard. Someone heard that an agency in the western suburbs wanted to paint many tables and chairs, but they had no transportation to pull them, so many women went early and returned late, bringing their own dry food to do the work, and received more than 200 yuan in processing fees after working for more than a month. No one wanted a penny of wages. All were accumulated as factory funds. They worked so hard, regardless of remuneration, and used the monthly processing fees, in addition to paying the necessary operating and management expenses, to expand reproduction and purchase raw materials and old equipment parts. The factory grew stronger day by day on this small foundation.

　　Equipment—Arming Themselves
　　Batches of housewives came to the factory to participate in production, and some scattered technicians on the streets were also absorbed, becoming a technical force in production. Soon, they accepted the production task of manufacturing more than 20 trailers required by Xuanwu Rubber Tire Factory. Everyone was extremely excited, but they were faced with heavy difficulties. Not only could the factory not fit a trailer, but there was no equipment needed to make the trailer. They thought that all factories were making great leaps forward, and they should also make great leaps forward. They could not ask others to process the parts for the trailer. At this critical moment, two production personnel who understood fitter technology discussed it and went to the Party branch secretary: "We want to make a native lathe to make trailer parts ourselves and also build a foundation for our factory." "Good! The Party will help you solve any difficulties!" The branch secretary actively supported them with such a firm tone. From that day on, several production personnel, with the support of the Party, ran around all day long. Sometimes they bought some waste materials from the scrap iron piles of some factories, and then rushed to other factories, taking advantage of lunch or after-work hours to use other people's lathes to process some machine parts. After being busy for more than 20 days, they finally used waste iron rails, angle iron, and cement to build the first native lathe. The problem of processing parts was easily solved.
　　Winning the first battle, the Party branch took advantage of the situation to launch a mass movement to vigorously develop native equipment in the entire factory. At this time, Beijing Transportation Electrical Materials Company asked them to make automobile parts, which required a gantry planer, and everyone decided to build it themselves. With the enthusiastic help of the Jiandu Foundry and the Affiliated Factory of Renmin University of China, a simple gantry planer was built in less than half a month. With the working machine—the gantry planer—they no longer had to ask others to plane. Immediately afterwards, they used the equipment they made to successively manufacture native equipment such as vertical milling machines, lathes, clapboard hammers, and friction sleeve machines. Through leasing, the factory buildings gradually developed from the original two and a half rooms to more than 90 rooms, connecting the three courtyards into one.

　　Technology—Learned and Studied
　　In the machine repair workshop, Sun Guilan, covered in oil, was turning parts in front of a spinning lathe. From her skilled operation, it is hard to imagine that this "female worker" had never seen a machine before a year ago. Since the day she put on her work clothes, she always came early and left late, doing whatever the master asked her to do, never picky. When she followed the master to repair trailers in the open air, she lay on the ground to tighten screws and put on iron plates. What she was always concerned about was to learn the technology as soon as possible and contribute more to the construction of socialism. In the past year of apprenticeship, Sun Guilan has put forward more than 50 rationalization proposals.

　　In the comprehensive factory, almost all the women who participated in production were like Sun Guilan. In the past, not to mention touching machines, they would feel their hearts "thumping" when they heard the motor running near the machine. However, when they were thrown into the furnace of productive labor, they all mastered general production skills in less than two years.

　　A Single Spark
　　"A single spark can start a prairie fire." This newly established factory has developed and grown in this way. It itself has the vitality of a new thing, not only growing stronger day by day, but also constantly "laying eggs" and supporting other newly established factories in the commune. In the past year, seven workshops and production groups have been successively separated from this factory, and three factories such as an electroplating factory, a metal factory, and a wood processing factory have been established, and four factories such as spray painting, art accessories, and chemicals have been assisted to develop from street production groups, further promoting the development of the commune's production cause. The Erlong Road People's Commune Spray Painting Factory, an advanced collective that was invited to participate in the National Conference of Heroes, was mainly established by more than 50 production personnel transferred from this comprehensive factory, taking some equipment and raw materials. Now, this commune-run spray painting factory has developed to more than 200 production personnel, doing processing work for more than 60 factories. (Attached picture)

    星火燎原
    ——北京市二龙路人民公社综合工厂创业记
    本报记者　孙世恺
    穿过弯弯曲曲的口袋胡同，就听到“叮叮当当”的响声。穿着灰色工作服的妇女们，在一个四合院的院内院外紧张地劳动着。
    工厂机修车间占用的后院，是当初兴办工厂时的老厂址，如今大变了。两间半歪歪扭扭的矮房子不见了。在这块“兴家立业”的地方建起一座新厂房。陪同我参观的宋明同志，一边走一边热情地说：“十多个家庭妇女在这儿白手起家办工厂时，谁能料到干出这样大的事。现在不仅有了安装、冲压和机修四个车间，生产人员增加到五百人以上，变成一座初具规模的工厂。一年多来，从这个工厂还陆续分出七个车间，有三百多生产人员带着一些设备和原料，另外组成了三个社办工厂，又辅助四个生产组发展成工厂。这个综合工厂在二龙路人民公社里确实成了‘星火燎原’，给公社发展工业打好了基础。
    赤手空拳办工厂
    那是两年以前，这一带的劳动居民在伟大的整风运动结束后，学习了党的社会主义建设总路线，大家正憋着一股劲要为社会主义“添砖添瓦”，党组织及时提出大搞街道生产的号召，给劳动居民指明了方向。被束缚在家务劳动中的妇女冲出了家门。当时，在口袋胡同和大木仓一带有十多个妇女最先动起手来。她们当中有电工、瓦匠的家属，也有司机、店员的家属，在党的支持下，日夜奔忙办工厂。
    生产什么？大家商量来讨论去，确定加工修理一起干，找到啥活就做啥活。十几个妇女像着迷一样，迎着风冒着雨到处奔走，张罗建厂。她们向居民借到两间半房子做厂址，要到一张破桌子和两条板凳，又多方面设法筹划到一百多块钱做资金。为了开展业务，先安装了一部电话，好找活源，弄原料。
    资金——一点一点积攒起来的
    工厂开办了，还没等挂出牌子。有的人就跑出去揽活，有的人在家打扫“厂房”。她们最先找到一家木材厂，联系了几次，只弄到十几个木箱的喷漆加工活。当时，人家对她们喷漆的质量抱着半信半疑的态度，不肯放手让她们干。可是，这个小小的工厂接到第一批活，尽管很少，也算正式“开张”生产了。可是，妇女们每个人都暗暗地下定决心：宁肯多流几把汗，一定要保证质量，创出牌子，树立信用。没过几天，第一批活交工了，木材厂验收后，认为质量合格，接着就送来更多的加工活。这时，喷漆的箱子一次再不是十几个，而是几十个了。没有喷枪，她们就用个自行车气管来代替，一个人打气一个人喷漆。活多了，屋里容不下，大家索性就在门道、院子里干。有人打听到西郊一个机关要油漆许多桌椅，但是没有运输工具拉不来，许多妇女就早去晚归，自带干粮上门去做活，干了一个来月收回二百多元加工费。谁也不肯要一文工钱。通统积累起来，作为工厂资金。她们这样穷干苦干，不计报酬，把每月所得的加工费除了支付必要的经营管理费用外，都用来扩大再生产，购买原材料和陈旧的设备部件。工厂就在这个小小的基础上一天天壮大成长。
    设备——自己武装自己
    家庭妇女一批又一批来到工厂参加生产，街道上的一些零散技工也被吸收进来，成为生产上的技术力量。不久，他们接受了宣武橡胶轮胎厂要求制造二十多台拖车的生产任务，大家兴奋极了，可是，眼前却摆着重重的困难，不仅厂里摆不下一辆拖车，作拖车所需要的设备一点也没有。他们想到所有工厂都在跃进，自己也应该跃进，不能求人家去加工拖车的零件。又听说好多大工厂的工人都敢想敢干制造土设备。在这个节骨眼上，两个懂钳工技术的生产人员一商量，就去找党支部书记：“我们想搞一台土车床，自造拖车零件，也给咱厂打个家底。”“好啊！有什么困难党帮助你们解决！”支部书记用这样坚定的口吻，积极地支持她们。从那天起，几个生产人员在党的支持下整天东奔西跑。有时从一些工厂的废铁堆里买回些废旧材料，又赶到别的工厂，趁着中午或下班的时间，利用人家的车床加工些机器的部件。这样忙碌了二十多天，终于用废铁轨、角铁和洋灰造出第一台土车床。加工零件的问题迎刃而解了。
    初战告捷，党支部就因势利导，在全厂掀起一个大搞土设备的群众运动。这时，北京市交通电器材料公司要求她们给做汽车零件，这又需要龙门刨床，大家决定还是自己造。在建都铸件厂、中国人民大学附属工厂等单位的热心帮助下，没过半个月就造出一台简易龙门刨床。有了工作母机——龙门刨床，刨活再不用求人了。紧接着她们就利用自己造的设备陆续制造出立铣、旋床、夹板锤和磨擦套扣机等土设备，通过租赁的方式，厂房由原来的两间半逐渐发展到九十多间，把三个院落打通了，连成一片。
    技术——学和钻来的
    在机修车间里，满身油垢的孙贵兰站在飞转的车床前旋活，从她那样熟练的操作，很难想到这个“女工”在一年多以前还是没有见过机器的家庭主妇。她自从穿上工作服那天起，总是早来晚走，师傅让干什么她就干什么，从不挑肥拣瘦。跟着师傅在露天修理拖车时，她躺在地上拧螺丝、上铁板。她时刻所关心的是尽快学会技术，在建设社会主义事业中多出一把力。在一年来的学徒过程中，孙贵兰提出了五十多项合理化建议。
    在综合工厂里，参加生产的妇女几乎都像孙贵兰一样，过去，不用说没摸过机械，就是走近机械旁听到马达响，心里还“咚咚”跳个不停。可是，当她们投到生产劳动的熔炉里，不到两年功夫都掌握了一般的生产本领。
    星星之火
    “星星之火，可以燎原”。这个新办的工厂就是这样发展壮大起来的。它本身有着新生事物的生命力，不仅日益茁壮成长，还不断“下蛋”和扶植公社内其他新办的工厂。一年来从这个工厂已经陆续分离出七个车间和生产组，成立了电镀厂、金属工厂和木材加工厂等三个工厂，并辅助街道生产组发展成喷漆、美术附件和化工等四个工厂，进一步促进公社生产事业的发展。曾应邀参加全国群英会的一个先进集体——二龙路人民公社喷漆厂，主要是由这个综合工厂抽调出来的五十多名生产人员，带着一部分设备和原料兴办起来的。现在，这个社办喷漆厂已发展到二百多名生产人员，为六十多个工厂做加工活。（附图片）
