Xinhua News Agency, August 8th—At today's plenary meeting of the Third Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers, many representatives' speeches illustrated the significant role that literary and artistic works reflecting realistic struggles and revolutionary historical struggles have played in inspiring the revolutionary enthusiasm and productive drive of the people, and in enhancing the people's communist ideological consciousness. The representatives also explained in their speeches that creating works of this kind has also played a positive role in the ideological transformation of literary and art workers. Only by rapidly transforming their thinking and establishing a communist worldview can literary and art workers better represent revolutionary heroes and the leaping forward era.

	Deng Hong, a revolutionary veteran from Jiangxi Province who participated in the Second Revolutionary Civil War, introduced his experience in writing revolutionary memoirs. In order to educate the younger generation in revolutionary traditions, he has, with the help of professional literary and art workers, successively compiled and published more than ten revolutionary historical stories such as "Adventures in the Mountains" and "Pan Hu" since 1956.

	Li Wei, a representative of the People's Liberation Army, said: Since the General Political Department launched the "Thirty Years of徵文 (徵文 can't be translated to English, it's a specific PLA historical context. The purpose of this campaign was to collect personal stories and accounts from veterans and soldiers within the PLA, documenting their experiences, achievements, and struggles over the past 30 years. It was a way to preserve the history of the PLA and to inspire future generations of soldiers. ) of the People's Liberation Army," generals, cadres, soldiers, and many elderly revolutionaries have enthusiastically taken up their pens, setting off a mass writing movement. The manuscripts selected by the military system and sent to the editorial department have reached more than 11,000, totaling approximately more than 40 million words. "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" is a book compiled from short revolutionary struggle memoirs. He pointed out that the emergence of a large number of revolutionary struggle memoirs has not only enriched our revolutionary military literature but also excavated the treasure trove of our revolutionary history, bringing a far-reaching and significant impact on future military literature creation with revolutionary war as the theme.

	Wu Xue, a representative from the drama circle, said that in the construction of drama repertoire, we have always adhered to the principle of focusing on modern drama repertoire that reflects China's current realistic struggles and historical revolutionary struggles. He pointed out that among the fifty-eight multi-act plays and one hundred and seventy-eight one-act plays created by the Beijing professional drama theaters since the Great Leap Forward, there are many excellent plays that directly reflect the current struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers, such as "Subduing Dragons and Tigers," "Long Live Heroes," and "Heroic Train," as well as short plays that closely cooperate with various movements. He used vivid examples to illustrate how these plays inspired the masses' production enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit.

	Guan Shanyue, a traditional Chinese painter, talked about the achievements of China's long-standing traditional Chinese painting in reflecting modern themes. He said that the heroic images of ordinary laborers have become the protagonists of figure paintings, landscape paintings depict the new faces of the motherland's mountains and rivers changed by the vast laboring people in their struggle with nature, and flower-and-bird paintings show thriving and competing scenes that are encouraging. Whether it is figure painting, landscape painting, or flower-and-bird painting, they all embody the new spirit of the times and the thoughts and feelings of the laboring people to a certain extent.

	How can we better express the new reality? Writer Liu Qing talked about his creative experience of going deep into life for a long time in his speech: We must strictly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, devote ourselves wholeheartedly and for a long time to the torrent of people's lives, and always be an active revolutionary. He said that describing China's socialist construction is still a work that has just begun, and it requires us to put in a lot of effort to explore how new political and ideological content can be better combined with art.

	China's newsreels are the vanguards of the times. Ding Qiao, a representative from the film industry, said in his speech that in order to quickly reflect the large number of emerging new people and new things, newsreel workers bravely went to the forefront of the struggle, regardless of hardship, and filmed many moving shots of the great real life. Newsreels are praised by the audience as "living newspapers" and "encyclopedias on the screen."

	Chen Bo, a representative from the photography circle, also talked about how China's photography art has become a powerful weapon for promoting socialism.

	Wu Baitao, a representative from the opera circle, talked about how many of China's traditional repertoires praise just wars, praise heroic spirit, show the people's clear love and hatred, distinct right and wrong, and shape the images of many heroes, inspiring the people's fighting will without making people's will depressed.

	Chen Bo, a representative from the film industry, said that China's revolutionary military-themed films have become a clarion call to inspire the people to move forward, a battle drum to inspire the people's fighting spirit, an indispensable spiritual food in the people's lives, and an image textbook for revolutionary historical tradition education.

	Also speaking at today's conference were Awang Kezeng from Tibet, Turdimusa and Maosai from Xinjiang (joint speech), Jiang Guiying from Hubei Province, Chu Chunyi, a member of the Wangren Commune in Fuyang County, Anhui Province, Jiang Xiuzhen, the head of the amateur cultural troupe of the Mayag Commune in Guichi County, famous Peking opera actress Tong Zhiling, young pianist Liu Shikun, and famous poet Ke Zhongping. A total of eighteen representatives spoke at the meeting today.

	Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, made a written speech at today's conference entitled "Cultural and Art Workers Must Fight to Thoroughly Realize the Party's Cultural Revolution Program."

	Tomorrow, the councils of various associations, research associations, and academic societies under the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles will hold meetings separately.

    据新华社8日讯　在今天的中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会的全体会议上，许多代表的发言，说明了反映现实斗争和革命历史斗争的文艺作品，在鼓舞人民群众革命热情和生产干劲、在提高人民的共产主义思想觉悟等方面起了重大的作用。代表们在发言中还说明，创作这类题材的作品，对文艺工作者的思想改造也起了积极的作用，文艺工作者只有迅速改造思想，树立共产主义的世界观，才能很好地表现革命英雄人物，表现跃进的时代。
    曾经参加过第二次国内革命战争的革命老战士、江西省代表邓洪在发言中介绍了他写革命回忆录的经验。为了向青年一代进行革命传统的教育，他从1956年以来，在专业文艺工作者的帮助下，已经陆续整理发表了“山中历险记”、“潘虎”等十多篇革命历史故事。
    解放军代表李伟说：自从总政治部发起了“解放军三十年征文”以后，将军、广大干部和战士以及许多年迈的革命老人，都热情地拿起了笔，掀起了一个群众性的写作运动。仅仅经部队系统层层挑选送到编辑部的征文，已达一万一千多篇，大约四千万字以上。“星火燎原”就是由短篇革命斗争回忆录汇编而成的一部书。他指出，大量的革命斗争回忆录的出现，不仅丰富了我们革命军事文学，同时也挖掘了我们革命历史的宝藏，为今后以描写革命战争为题材的军事文学创作，带来了深远的、巨大的影响。
    话剧界代表吴雪在发言中说，我们在话剧剧目建设上始终坚持以反映我国当前现实斗争和历史革命斗争的现代剧剧目为主。他指出，北京市专业话剧院大跃进以来创作的五十八个多幕剧、一百七十八个独幕剧中，就有“降龙伏虎”、“英雄万岁”、“英雄列车”等许多直接反映当前工农兵斗争生活的优秀剧目和密切配合各项运动的短小剧目。他用生动的事例说明这些剧目怎样鼓舞了群众的生产干劲和革命精神。
    国画家关山月谈到我国历史悠久的国画在反映现代题材方面的成绩时说，普通劳动者的英雄形象成了人物画的主人公，山水画描绘了广大劳动人民与大自然搏斗中所改变了的祖国的山川新貌，花鸟画里出现了欣欣向荣、争妍斗艳的令人欢欣鼓舞的景色。不论人物画、山水画、花鸟画，都在一定程度上体现了新的时代精神，体现了劳动人民的思想感情。
    怎样才能更好地表现新的现实生活呢？作家柳青在发言中以他长期深入生活的创作体会谈到：必须严格的遵循毛主席的教导，全身心地长期投入人民生活的洪流，永远做一个积极的革命者。他说，描写中国的社会主义建设，还是一项刚开头的工作，需要我们付出大量的心血，来摸索新的政治思想内容怎样和艺术结合得更好。
    我国的新闻纪录电影是时代的尖兵。电影界代表丁峤在发言中谈到，新闻电影工作者为了迅速反映大量涌现的新人新事，不怕艰苦勇敢地去到斗争的最前线，拍下了伟大现实生活中的许多动人镜头。新闻影片被观众称赞为是“活报纸”，是“银幕上的大百科全书”。
    摄影界代表陈勃在发言中，也谈到了我国摄影艺术怎样成为宣传社会主义的有力武器。
    戏曲界代表吴白匋谈到我国的传统剧目中有许多歌颂正义战争、歌颂英雄气概的作品，表现出人民爱憎分明，是非显著，塑造出不少英雄人物的形象，鼓舞人民的斗争意志而不至使人意志消沉。
    电影界代表陈播说，我国的革命军事题材影片，成为鼓舞人民前进的号角，成为激发人民斗志的战鼓，成为人民生活中不可缺少的精神食粮，成为革命历史传统教育的形象教科书。
    在今天的大会上发言的，还有西藏代表阿旺克增、新疆代表吐尔地木沙和茅塞（联合发言）、湖北省代表蒋桂英、安徽省阜阳县王人公社社员储纯一和贵池县马牙公社业余文工团团长姜秀珍、京剧名演员童芷苓、青年钢琴家刘诗昆、著名的诗人柯仲平。今天在会上发言的共十八位代表。
