Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 10th: In order to supply the steel industry with more coal, major coal mines in Chongqing have, since the second half of July, had cadres at all levels further delve into the front line of production, earnestly solving specific problems in production, so that production continues to rise. From July 16 to August 2, the average daily output of raw coal and coke increased by 7.8% and 18.9% respectively compared with the first half of July, and the average daily footage of tunneling increased by 32.5%.

More than 85% of the cadres in various mines have gone deep into the front line of production. Various mines have universally promoted the Yutianpu Coal Mine's system of underground office work and political work going down to the mines, workshops, and kitchens. Cadres focus on consolidating, promoting, and improving new technologies and experiences in the mines, ensuring that new technologies and new experiences are normally used in production. In the No. 1 Water Mining Area of the Nantong Coal Mine in Chongqing, the sedimentation tank was often blocked, and a large amount of mud coal blocked the transportation road, so that hydraulic mining could not be carried out normally. After consulting with the mine's leading cadres and employees, measures were taken to increase the sedimentation tank, lengthen the mud coal chute, and extend the transportation road, so that the production of this mining area returned to normal, and the daily output of raw coal increased by about three times compared with the original. The Secretary of the Party Committee of the Yutianpu Coal Mine went to work in the No. 1 mine, and in response to the situation that the coal cutting machine was not operating normally, he consulted with the workers to lengthen the cutting disc of the coal cutting machine and adopted the advanced coal mining method of "one cut, one shot," so that the daily output of raw coal increased by two to three times compared with the original.

The employees of various mines also worked hard to seize tunneling work. The miners adopted advanced operating experiences such as using multiple pneumatic drills to make holes, and improved the management methods of tunneling, which accelerated the tunneling speed and created favorable conditions for a substantial increase in coal production. After the employees of the Yutianpu Coal Mine adopted the method of assigning leaders, tasks, personnel, time, and equipment, the tunneling work maintained a certain strength, and the tunneling could be carried out in a balanced and normal manner, and the tunneling personnel became more familiar with the situation and better improved their technical level. This also helped to strengthen the maintenance of tunneling tools, which greatly accelerated the progress of tunneling. The tunneling progress of the entire mine in July increased by 12.8% compared with June, and by the end of July, the number of coal mining faces had increased from eleven to fourteen.

Various coal mines have also vigorously strengthened the leadership of the mine's transportation work, and generally renovated and repaired the transportation lines, coal cars, and locomotives on the ground and in the tunnels. The Nantong Coal Mine has newly built a batch of earthen coal bunkers and built a coal loading platform of more than 100 meters long, which completely changed the previous situation of having no place to store coal, and made it possible to store as much as possible. The mine also realized major innovations such as automatic winch unhooking and hydraulic coal transportation through the method of "three combinations," which shortened the loading time, accelerated the turnover of vehicles, and reduced the number of loading and unloading workers by more than half, and the saved labor force has been strengthened in the front line of production. After the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine thoroughly transformed the roadways and transportation lines in the South Mine, motor vehicle transportation was realized in the mine, the capacity of the mine cars was changed from one ton to three tons, the transportation efficiency was increased by three times compared with the original, and twenty-four labor forces could be saved every day.

    普遍实行井下办公　深入开展技术革命
    重庆各大煤矿回采掘进齐上升
    新华社重庆10日电　重庆市各大型煤矿为了供应钢铁工业更多的煤炭，从7月下半月以来，各级干部进一步深入生产第一线，踏踏实实地解决生产中的具体问题，使生产不断上升。7月16日到8月2日，原煤和焦炭的平均日产量，分别比7月上半月增长7.8％、18.9％，平均日掘进进尺增长32.5％。
    各矿85％以上的干部，都深入到了生产第一线。各矿普遍推广了鱼田堡煤矿的井下办公和政治工作下井、下工房、下厨房的制度。干部们在井下狠抓新技术、新经验的巩固、推广和提高工作，使新技术新经验正常用于生产。重庆市南桐煤矿一井水采区，由于沉淀池经常堵塞，大量泥煤塞住运输道，以致水力采煤不能正常进行。矿的领导干部和职工商量以后，采取了加大沉淀池、加长泥煤溜子和延长运输道等措施，使这个采区的生产正常起来，原煤日产量比原来提高三倍左右。鱼田堡煤矿的党委书记到一井跟班劳动，针对截煤机运转不够正常的情况，和工人一道商量，加长了截煤机的截盘，采用“一刀一炮”的先进采煤方法，使原煤日产量比原来提高二至三倍。
    各矿职工还大抓掘进工作。矿工们采用了多台风钻打眼等先进操作经验，并改进了掘进的管理方法，加快了掘进速度，为煤炭大幅度增产创造了有利条件。鱼田堡煤矿职工采取定领导、定任务、定人员、定时间、定设备等办法以后，使掘进工作保持了一定的力量，掘进得以均衡正常进行，而且使掘进人员更加熟悉情况，更好地提高自己的技术水平。这样做也有利于加强对掘进工具的维护工作，从而大大加快了掘进的进度。全矿7月份掘进进度比6月份提高12.8％，到7月底，采煤工作面已由十一个增加到十四个。
    各煤矿还大力加强了对矿内运输工作的领导，对地面和坑道的运输线路、煤车、机车普遍进行了改造和检修。南桐煤矿新修了一批土煤仓，并修了长达一百多米的装煤台，彻底改变了以往煤多无处堆放的状况，做到了有多少储多少。这个矿还通过“三结合”的方法，实现了绞车自动摘钩、水力运煤等重大革新，缩短了装车时间，加速了车辆周转，装卸工人比原来减少一半多，节省的劳力已加强了生产第一线。中梁山煤矿将南矿井井下的巷道、运输线路进行彻底改造以后，井下实现了电机车运输，矿车容量由一吨改为三吨，运输工效比原来提高三倍，每天可以节约二十四个劳动力。
